Hi. DC Fran Lingley.

87
00:05:39,216 --> 00:05:40,324
Trying to trace a man

88
00:05:40,326 --> 00:05:42,293
we believe may have stayed here
a few years ago.

89
00:05:42,295 --> 00:05:44,786
Wondered if you had any records
on him. Name of Clive Walsh.

90
00:05:46,686 --> 00:05:49,493
<font color="yellow">Also, I spoke to Hendon first thing.</font>

00:05:49,495 --> 00:05:52,856

<font color="yellow">lead trainer for us. </font>Yeah.

92
00:05:54,096 --> 00:05:58,534
I just think the more of a sense
we can get of them as people,

93
00:05:58,536 --> 00:06:01,373
cos if this was a murder,

94
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:03,014
that is just such
an extraordinary thing

95
00:06:03,016 --> 00:06:05,136
for five newbie coppers
to have been involved with.

96
00:06:07,045 --> 00:06:08,966
That just doesn't come
out of nowhere, does it?

97
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:14,534
<font color="cyan">Er, yeah, OK. The last record</font>
<font color="cyan">we've got of Clive,</font>

98
00:06:14,536 --> 00:06:19,173
<font color="cyan">he's been given a residential place</font>
<font color="cyan">just under two years ago</font>

00:06:19,175 --> 00:06:20,536
<font color="cyan">in a halfway house in Bow.</font>

<font color="yellow">Lizzie. Hello.</font>

00:06:45,786 --> 00:06:49,684
I have to search you, I'm afraid.
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry?</font>

103
00:06:49,686 --> 00:06:52,173
I have to check
you're not wearing a wire.

104
00:06:52,175 --> 00:06:54,654
<font color="yellow">Wearing...?!</font>
SHE SCOFFS

105
00:06:54,656 --> 00:06:57,014
<font color="yellow">Jesus, Liz. What do you think of me?</font>

106
00:06:57,016 --> 00:06:58,656
Or I'll walk away.
<font color="yellow">Liz!</font>

107
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:02,686
<font color="yellow">OK. OK. Oh, my God.</font>

108
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:14,326
I need to see your phone.

109
00:07:18,856 --> 00:07:22,326
I need to know you're not recording
anything. Thank you.

110
00:07:33,295 --> 00:07:39,574
<font color="yellow">So... I presume they've</font>
<font color="yellow">spoken to you? The police?</font>

111
00:07:39,576 --> 00:07:42,456
Yes.
<font color="yellow">But what have you said?</font>

112
00:07:44,326 --> 00:07:47,604
I just told 'em the truth, Fiona.

113
00:07:47,606 --> 00:07:51,064
Like we agreed. I hope you did too.

114
00:07:51,066 --> 00:07:54,966
<font color="yellow">Oh, fuck! No. Sorry.</font>

115
00:07:56,096 --> 00:07:57,776
<font color="yellow">It was 30 years ago.</font>

116
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:00,425
What did you tell them, then?

117
00:08:02,295 --> 00:08:03,886
<font color="yellow">I told them...</font>

118
00:08:05,245 --> 00:08:07,934
<font color="yellow">..I was too drunk</font>
<font color="yellow">to remember anything.</font>

119
00:08:07,936 --> 00:08:11,526
OK. Well, that can work for now.

120
00:08:12,686 --> 00:08:15,654
And if they interview you again,

121
00:08:15,656 --> 00:08:18,495
then the truth can slowly
come back to you.

122
00:08:20,326 --> 00:08:22,136
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>

123
00:08:25,425 --> 00:08:26,576
You remember it?

124
00:08:28,856 --> 00:08:31,064
<font color="yellow">Erm...</font>

125
00:08:31,066 --> 00:08:35,425
<font color="yellow">..after Rob got pulled,</font>
<font color="yellow">you drove the rest of us home...</font>

126
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:42,096
<font color="yellow">..before taking his car back to his,</font>
<font color="yellow">which was near where you lived.</font>

127
00:08:43,295 --> 00:08:47,736
And how did I get from Rob's
to my flat? <font color="yellow">You walked? </font>Good.

128
00:08:52,165 --> 00:08:53,816
<font color="yellow">And, erm...</font>

129
00:08:56,966 --> 00:08:58,686
<font color="yellow">..what if they find out</font>
<font color="yellow">about the pub?</font>

130
00:08:59,656 --> 00:09:01,454
They won't find out about the pub.

131
00:09:01,456 --> 00:09:05,854
They have no connection to us
in the pub. No names, anywhere.

I'm trying to remain
as dispassionate as possible.

139
00:09:35,656 --> 00:09:38,936
I think it's the most useful thing
to do right now.

140
00:09:43,245 --> 00:09:44,495
I have to go.

that sticks in your mind?

232

<font color="cyan">For whatever reason...</font>

248
00:14:58,746 --> 00:15:00,933
But obviously,
if they start looking at us closely,

249
00:15:00,935 --> 00:15:02,774
they'll be looking at me closely,
so...

250
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:06,935
Bottom line, we stick to the truth,
you know. We'll be fine. <font color="yellow">We hope.</font>

00:15:09,216 --> 00:15:10,496
So, I've got to go, fella.

252
00:15:12,546 --> 00:15:14,704
That business the other day,
all went all right?

253
00:15:14,706 --> 00:15:16,654
<font color="yellow">Yeah. Yeah, it was fine.</font>

<font color="yellow">at short notice. </font>Last time, yeah.

255
00:15:20,626 --> 00:15:23,986
I've moved on now.
<font color="yellow">Absolutely, me too. It's a one-off.</font>

259
00:15:55,466 --> 00:15:57,544
My name is DC Fran Lingley,

260
00:15:57,546 --> 00:16:01,106
and I have some news
about your brother, Matthew.

261
00:16:02,906 --> 00:16:04,214
Sweet cicely?

262
00:16:04,216 --> 00:16:06,794
<font color="cyan">'Yes, so it's native to the north,</font>
<font color="cyan">which means'</font>

263
00:16:06,796 --> 00:16:09,514
<font color="cyan">you're very unlikely to find it</font>
<font color="cyan">growing wild down here.</font>

264
00:16:09,516 --> 00:16:12,904
OK. <font color="cyan">'So, within the rough area</font>
<font color="cyan">he was last seen in,</font>

265
00:16:12,906 --> 00:16:14,214
<font color="cyan">'I'd be looking for'</font>

266
00:16:14,216 --> 00:16:15,984
<font color="cyan">vegetable plots in gardens, or,</font>

267
00:16:15,986 --> 00:16:19,214
<font color="cyan">and for me this is the most likely</font>
<font color="cyan">scenario, an allotment.</font>

268
00:16:19,216 --> 00:16:21,744
Right. Thank you.

269
00:16:21,746 --> 00:16:24,744
<font color="yellow">And he is happy to come here?</font>
<font color="#008000">'Yes, he is.' </font><font color="yellow">OK.</font>

270
00:16:24,746 --> 00:16:27,466
<font color="yellow">'We're on our way back. Be there</font>
<font color="yellow">in about 20.' </font><font color="#008000">OK, see you then.</font>

271
00:16:30,626 --> 00:16:32,746
<font color="#008000">OK, Clive. Shall we get going?</font>

272
00:16:36,065 --> 00:16:39,774
<font color="yellow">Fran's found the brother.</font>
Whose brother? <font color="yellow">Matthew Walsh's.</font>

273
00:16:39,776 --> 00:16:42,774
<font color="yellow">Turns out he was with Matthew</font>
<font color="yellow">the night he disappeared. </font>No!

274
00:16:42,776 --> 00:16:44,935
<font color="yellow">He was having a pee in the bushes</font>
<font color="yellow">when the car pulled up.</font>

275
00:16:46,055 --> 00:16:48,346
<font color="yellow">He saw everything.</font>

276
00:16:52,935 --> 00:16:57,133
<font color="cyan">Yeah. I remember the case,</font>
<font color="cyan">because of his colour.</font>

277
00:16:57,135 --> 00:16:58,824
Whose colour?

278
00:16:58,826 --> 00:17:00,854
<font color="cyan">The probationer</font>
<font color="cyan">involved in the altercation.</font>

279
00:17:00,856 --> 00:17:05,133
So, you receive details
that Walsh made a pass at a woman...

280
00:17:05,135 --> 00:17:06,494
<font color="cyan">Who was also a probie, I think.</font>

281
00:17:06,496 --> 00:17:08,774
..and she blanked him,
and he got a bit lairy,

282
00:17:08,776 --> 00:17:11,024
and then a lad she was having
a drink with intervened,

283
00:17:11,026 --> 00:17:12,464
and that's when it all kicked off?

284
00:17:12,466 --> 00:17:15,744
<font color="cyan">After Walsh made racially abusive</font>
<font color="cyan">remarks, I think.</font>

285
00:17:15,746 --> 00:17:17,744
And I'm assuming
it was just a bit of handbags,

286
00:17:17,746 --> 00:17:19,933
because Walsh only got cautioned?
<font color="cyan">No, not at all.</font>

287
00:17:19,935 --> 00:17:23,494
<font color="cyan">Walsh actually gave the lad</font>
<font color="cyan">a bit of a kicking. </font>So...

288
00:17:23,496 --> 00:17:26,776
<font color="cyan">So, he was let off, because</font>
<font color="cyan">my sergeant wanted it buried.</font>

289
00:17:28,746 --> 00:17:31,484
<font color="cyan">If Walsh had been charged,</font>
<font color="cyan">there would have been a court case,</font>

290
00:17:31,486 --> 00:17:33,776
<font color="cyan">and the probationer would have</font>
<font color="cyan">got in trouble and...</font>

291
00:17:35,026 --> 00:17:37,544
<font color="cyan">Obviously, we'd just started</font>
<font color="cyan">recruiting ethnic minorities,</font>

292
00:17:37,546 --> 00:17:39,414
<font color="cyan">so it wouldn't have played out well</font>
<font color="cyan">for anyone.</font>

293
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:42,933
So, the fact there's no other names
in this report, apart from Walsh's,

294
00:17:42,935 --> 00:17:44,053
that was deliberate?

295
00:17:44,055 --> 00:17:46,263
<font color="cyan">I didn't write this report,</font>
<font color="cyan">my sergeant did,</font>

296
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:48,466
<font color="cyan">and he's been dead ten years,</font>
<font color="cyan">but, yeah.</font>

297
00:17:49,906 --> 00:17:54,414
<font color="cyan">I'm guessing he was protecting</font>
<font color="cyan">the witnesses,</font>

298
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:58,135
<font color="cyan">the girl, and very particularly,</font>
<font color="cyan">the Asian lad.</font>

299
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:02,263
<font color="#008000">And as we were walking</font>
<font color="#008000">across Napley Green,</font>

300
00:18:02,265 --> 00:18:05,466
<font color="#008000">I decided to duck</font>
<font color="#008000">into the bush for a pee.</font>

301
00:18:06,626 --> 00:18:10,904
<font color="#008000">Just as I did,</font>
<font color="#008000">I heard a shout, "Oi! Walshy boy!"</font>

302
00:18:10,906 --> 00:18:16,053
<font color="#008000">I turned, and I saw this car</font>
<font color="#008000">about 50 yards away,</font>

303
00:18:16,055 --> 00:18:18,414
<font color="#008000">with a bloke getting out</font>
<font color="#008000">the front passenger seat,</font>

304
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:20,053
<font color="#008000">and he was just running at Matty.</font>

305
00:18:20,055 --> 00:18:23,624
And do you remember what
he looked like? <font color="#008000">Asian guy.</font>

306
00:18:23,626 --> 00:18:24,854
And what did your brother do?

307
00:18:24,856 --> 00:18:27,854
<font color="#008000">Well, he looked pretty useful</font>
<font color="#008000">and angry,</font>

308
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:31,854
<font color="#008000">and there was others in the car,</font>
<font color="#008000">so he just ran.</font>

309
00:18:31,856 --> 00:18:36,104
<font color="#008000">And I had just a second or two</font>
<font color="#008000">to decide, you know,</font>

310
00:18:36,106 --> 00:18:40,414
<font color="#008000">show him that there was two of us,</font>
<font color="#008000">make him think twice, maybe?</font>

311
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:45,385
<font color="#008000">I've never had a fight in my life,</font>
<font color="#008000">so I ducked down...</font>

312
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:48,746
<font color="#008000">..and I hid.</font>

313
00:18:51,466 --> 00:18:53,904
<font color="#008000">And then, the driver got out.</font>

314
00:18:53,906 --> 00:18:58,466
<font color="#008000">Tall fella, ran off</font>
<font color="#008000">in the direction of the others.</font>

315
00:18:59,986 --> 00:19:02,183
<font color="#008000">And then about 30 seconds later,</font>
<font color="#008000">the third man.</font>

316
00:19:02,185 --> 00:19:04,296
<font color="#008000">I could still see two others</font>
<font color="#008000">in the back seats.</font>

317
00:19:05,546 --> 00:19:08,414
<font color="#008000">After about five minutes,</font>
<font color="#008000">they got out as well</font>

318
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:12,416
<font color="#008000">and they were all quickly off in</font>
<font color="#008000">the direction the others had gone.</font>

319
00:19:16,055 --> 00:19:19,624
<font color="#008000">But these two were women.</font>

320
00:19:19,626 --> 00:19:21,904
<font color="#008000">And that was it.</font>

321
00:19:21,906 --> 00:19:26,546
<font color="#008000">I never saw them,</font>
<font color="#008000">or my brother, again.</font>

322
00:19:28,385 --> 00:19:32,104
Why did you never say anything
about this at the time?

323
00:19:32,106 --> 00:19:35,774
<font color="#008000">I had a job.</font>
<font color="#008000">In Cyprus, in a club.</font>

324
00:19:35,776 --> 00:19:37,774
<font color="#008000">I had to fly out the next day</font>
<font color="#008000">to start,</font>

325
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:40,133
<font color="#008000">but this was before mobile phones,</font>

326
00:19:40,135 --> 00:19:43,744
<font color="#008000">so I didn't even hear</font>
<font color="#008000">that he was missing for weeks,</font>

327
00:19:43,746 --> 00:19:48,544
<font color="#008000">and when I did get back, early June,</font>
<font color="#008000">pretty much everyone just reckoned</font>

328
00:19:48,546 --> 00:19:52,294
<font color="#008000">he was lying low, because of</font>
<font color="#008000">the warrants that was out for him.</font>

329
00:19:52,296 --> 00:19:55,776
<font color="#008000">Everyone reckoned</font>
<font color="#008000">he'd just turn up one day.</font>

330
00:19:59,496 --> 00:20:02,546
<font color="#008000">Except me, because in my gut...</font>

331
00:20:04,135 --> 00:20:07,026
<font color="#008000">..I think I knew that he died</font>
<font color="#008000">that night.</font>

332
00:20:09,265 --> 00:20:11,694
HE EXHALES

333
00:20:11,696 --> 00:20:15,053
<font color="#008000">And the reason</font>
<font color="#008000">I never said anything,</font>

334
00:20:15,055 --> 00:20:19,333
<font color="#008000">that's because I did not want</font>
<font color="#008000">anyone to know</font>

335
00:20:19,335 --> 00:20:23,586
<font color="#008000">what a snivelling gutless coward</font>
<font color="#008000">I was.</font>

336
00:20:27,116 --> 00:20:28,346
Thank you.

337
00:20:35,556 --> 00:20:38,784
OK. So, we now know for sure
that they all got out.

338
00:20:38,786 --> 00:20:40,754
<font color="yellow">And in pursuit of the victim.</font>
Exactly.

339
00:20:40,756 --> 00:20:42,504
Which means,
as far as I'm concerned,

340
00:20:42,506 --> 00:20:45,586
they're definitely
all in the frame now.

341
00:20:54,034 --> 00:20:56,671
<font color="cyan">So here is an allotment,</font>

342
00:20:56,673 --> 00:21:00,982
<font color="cyan">and if we draw a line up</font>
<font color="cyan">from where the car stopped...</font>

343
00:21:00,984 --> 00:21:05,541
<font color="cyan">up here... up here...</font>

344
00:21:05,543 --> 00:21:09,782
<font color="cyan">and ending somewhere</font>
<font color="cyan">in the allotment,</font>

345
00:21:09,784 --> 00:21:12,622
<font color="cyan">it fits very well with the various</font>
<font color="cyan">witness statement sightings</font>

346
00:21:12,624 --> 00:21:14,832
<font color="cyan">at the chase.</font>
And if we can identify where exactly

347
00:21:14,834 --> 00:21:16,832
on the allotment this plant
might've grown,

348
00:21:16,834 --> 00:21:19,032
we might find
his actual place of death. <font color="cyan">Mm.</font>

349
00:21:19,034 --> 00:21:20,262
I mean, my guess is...

350
00:21:20,264 --> 00:21:23,502
Look, it would had to have been
near the road to pull the car up to.

351
00:21:23,504 --> 00:21:25,541
Maybe we can even get
some boards up.

352
00:21:25,543 --> 00:21:28,262
Might trigger some more memories.
<font color="cyan">Yeah, absolutely.</font>

353
00:21:28,264 --> 00:21:30,262
OK, very good. Thank you. Caz?

354
00:21:30,264 --> 00:21:32,902
<font color="#008000">The only concrete thing I have</font>
<font color="#008000">is on Fiona Grayson.</font>

355
00:21:32,904 --> 00:21:35,561
<font color="#008000">A 1993 dangerous driving conviction.</font>

356
00:21:35,563 --> 00:21:37,361
<font color="#008000">Trying to get the original files.</font>
OK.

357
00:21:37,363 --> 00:21:40,341
<font color="#008000">But nothing on Elizabeth Baildon</font>
<font color="#008000">and nothing on...</font>

358
00:21:40,343 --> 00:21:43,032
<font color="#008000">well, apart from his internal</font>
<font color="#008000">disciplinary record,</font>

359
00:21:43,034 --> 00:21:44,982
<font color="#008000">on Ramjeet Sidhu.</font>
Which we're looking into.

360
00:21:44,984 --> 00:21:47,182
<font color="#008000">Yep. And Dean Barton,</font>
<font color="#008000">no criminal record.</font>

361
00:21:47,184 --> 00:21:50,182
<font color="#008000">Although I am having trouble</font>
<font color="#008000">finding a couple of basic documents.</font>

362
00:21:50,184 --> 00:21:51,902
<font color="#008000">I can't find his birth certificate</font>

363
00:21:51,904 --> 00:21:54,591
<font color="#008000">and I can't find him on the census</font>
<font color="#008000">pre '91. </font>OK.

364
00:21:54,593 --> 00:21:57,032
And something else just to feed in
as background -

365
00:21:57,034 --> 00:22:01,062
all five of them had no guests
at their passing-out parade.

366
00:22:01,064 --> 00:22:04,182
No family, no friends. No nothing.

367
00:22:04,184 --> 00:22:07,112
Yeah. It's one to mull on, maybe.

368
00:22:07,114 --> 00:22:10,262
And definitely a picture
starting to emerge of Ram Sidhu

369
00:22:10,264 --> 00:22:12,671
being a person who pushed
the envelope, even back then.

370
00:22:12,673 --> 00:22:15,591
We know he was probably first
out the car,

371
00:22:15,593 --> 00:22:19,832
so was probably the most likely
to catch up with Matthew first,

372
00:22:19,834 --> 00:22:21,954
and then, this afternoon...

373
00:22:23,064 --> 00:22:24,671
Murray slightly struck gold.

374
00:22:24,673 --> 00:22:27,262
<font color="yellow">So, three weeks before</font>
<font color="yellow">Matthew disappeared,</font>

375
00:22:27,264 --> 00:22:30,982
<font color="yellow">we've got pretty good evidence</font>
<font color="yellow">to suggest that in a pub in Hendon,</font>

376
00:22:30,984 --> 00:22:33,671
<font color="yellow">he committed an ABH on Ram Sidhu.</font>

377
00:22:33,673 --> 00:22:35,471
<font color="cyan">No.</font>
The fight was over a girl.

378
00:22:35,473 --> 00:22:38,032
No names in the arrest sheet,
but we know our suspects were a gang

379
00:22:38,034 --> 00:22:41,461
so there's a fair chance they were
all drinking together that night

380
00:22:41,463 --> 00:22:43,981
and the girl was even Fiona Grayson
or Liz Baildon.

381
00:22:43,983 --> 00:22:46,620
For various reasons,
Walsh only got a caution

382
00:22:46,622 --> 00:22:51,290
and Murray's trying to track down
Susie Montgomery, the landlady.

383
00:22:51,292 --> 00:22:53,490
But I think, alongside opportunity,

384
00:22:53,492 --> 00:22:57,343
fairly reasonable now to suggest
we also have a possible motive.

385
00:22:58,733 --> 00:23:03,161
Albeit one that for whatever reason
seems to have escalated

386
00:23:03,163 --> 00:23:05,683
from a reciprocal slap
to something...

387
00:23:06,883 --> 00:23:10,320
..far more violent
and involving four other people.

388
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:13,121
So, I think we pull Sidhu in now,
confront him with this

389
00:23:13,123 --> 00:23:15,683
and see what we get.
Thank you, guys.

390
00:23:29,683 --> 00:23:31,881
<font color="yellow">You don't think we should wait</font>
<font color="yellow">till Murray finds out</font>

391
00:23:31,883 --> 00:23:34,320
<font color="yellow">if Montgomery's still around?</font>
<font color="yellow">I mean, if she can ID Sidhu</font>

392
00:23:34,322 --> 00:23:36,371
<font color="yellow">or any one of the women...</font>
What are the chances?

393
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:39,400
I mean, I was drinking in The Ifield
just a few months later,

394
00:23:39,402 --> 00:23:41,931
and she was about 500 years old.

395
00:23:41,933 --> 00:23:45,933
So, no.
Let's get him in now, please.

396
00:23:47,652 --> 00:23:48,652
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

397
00:23:50,733 --> 00:23:53,570
DOOR OPENS AND SHUTS

398
00:23:53,572 --> 00:23:54,883
HER PHONE BUZZES

399
00:24:21,013 --> 00:24:22,371
Hiya.
<font color="cyan">Hi.</font>

400
00:24:22,373 --> 00:24:24,320
This is a nice surprise.
Were you up anyway...?

401
00:24:24,322 --> 00:24:26,011
<font color="cyan">No, no, here on a whim.</font>

402
00:24:26,013 --> 00:24:28,801
<font color="cyan">I thought, if you had half an hour,</font>
<font color="cyan">maybe we could just...</font>

403
00:24:28,803 --> 00:24:31,091
Ah, love, no,
I haven't got half an hour.

404
00:24:31,093 --> 00:24:32,731
<font color="cyan">OK, ten minutes?</font>

405
00:24:32,733 --> 00:24:34,522
How about five?

406
00:24:36,373 --> 00:24:39,601
I don't generally take lunch.
If you'd booked me last week or...

407
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:41,931
<font color="cyan">"Booked you"? Well, OK.</font>
Sorry, I don't mean that like...

408
00:24:41,933 --> 00:24:43,881
<font color="cyan">No, no, no, it doesn't matter,</font>
<font color="cyan">it's fine.</font>

409
00:24:43,883 --> 00:24:45,570
<font color="cyan">OK, I'll be quick, then.</font>

410
00:24:45,572 --> 00:24:47,761
<font color="cyan">So, erm, I went into all</font>
<font color="cyan">the agencies near mine,</font>

411
00:24:47,763 --> 00:24:49,731
<font color="cyan">got a list of all the properties</font>
<font color="cyan">within our range -</font>

412
00:24:49,733 --> 00:24:51,681
<font color="cyan">that way we can get an idea</font>
<font color="cyan">of what we're after,</font>

413
00:24:51,683 --> 00:24:55,121
<font color="cyan">so, why don't you take a look</font>
<font color="cyan">and we can discuss later?</font>

414
00:24:55,123 --> 00:24:56,931
Ah...

415
00:24:56,933 --> 00:25:01,371
Oh, perfect.
Thank you so much for doing that.

416
00:25:01,373 --> 00:25:03,211
<font color="cyan">Yeah, yeah, no problem.</font>

417
00:25:03,213 --> 00:25:05,400
<font color="cyan">So have you spoken to your dad</font>
<font color="cyan">again?</font>

418
00:25:05,402 --> 00:25:07,851
Er, not since Eddie took him out,
no.

419
00:25:07,853 --> 00:25:10,491
I spoke to a lawyer, though.
<font color="cyan">A lawyer?</font>

420
00:25:10,493 --> 00:25:12,603
Yeah.
Only from work, mate of a mate.

421
00:25:14,213 --> 00:25:17,322
I just wanted the top line
on our rights. <font color="cyan">Cass...</font>

422
00:25:18,572 --> 00:25:20,761
<font color="cyan">I mean, listen,</font>
<font color="cyan">it's your life, but...</font>

423
00:25:20,763 --> 00:25:22,601
<font color="cyan">I don't think a lawyer</font>
<font color="cyan">is the way to go.</font>

424
00:25:22,603 --> 00:25:24,163
Yeah, I know, I know, I just...

425
00:25:27,402 --> 00:25:30,881
Oh, f... fuck,
I can't lose this anger, John.

426
00:25:30,883 --> 00:25:32,243
I wish I could, but...

427
00:25:33,522 --> 00:25:37,731
On top of everything else,
that woman, she's just... she...

428
00:25:37,733 --> 00:25:40,490
<font color="cyan">Yeah, I know. I get that.</font>
<font color="cyan">I do, but...</font>

429
00:25:40,492 --> 00:25:43,701
<font color="cyan">Please don't tell either of them</font>
<font color="cyan">you've spoken to a lawyer,</font>

430
00:25:43,703 --> 00:25:45,823
<font color="cyan">because that'll just...</font>
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know.

431
00:25:48,372 --> 00:25:49,823
Ah, I've got to go.

432
00:25:51,013 --> 00:25:55,370
I'll look at these later.
And, erm... it's a nice idea.

433
00:25:55,372 --> 00:25:56,931
And next week,
hopefully I'll be freer,

434
00:25:56,933 --> 00:25:58,261
and then let's do it properly.

435
00:25:58,263 --> 00:26:00,651
<font color="cyan">Yeah, I'll book you in (!)</font>
Ha. Piss off.

436
00:26:00,653 --> 00:26:01,733
HE CHUCKLES

437
00:26:08,053 --> 00:26:09,213
Hey.

438
00:26:15,292 --> 00:26:18,290
<font color="yellow">Been trying to get hold of you.</font>
<font color="yellow">Claire had no idea where you were.</font>

439
00:26:18,292 --> 00:26:19,821
Well, I was at the meeting, why?

440
00:26:19,823 --> 00:26:23,181
<font color="yellow">Jack's temperature's gone up to 101.</font>
Oh, no.

441
00:26:23,183 --> 00:26:25,901
Do you think it's another infection?
<font color="yellow">I dunno.</font>

442
00:26:25,903 --> 00:26:29,540
<font color="yellow">But his chest sounds dreadful,</font>
<font color="yellow">so... so I've called the GP.</font>

443
00:26:29,542 --> 00:26:31,903
All right, I'll...
I'll go and see him.

444
00:26:33,622 --> 00:26:36,183
<font color="yellow">You never told me the police</font>
<font color="yellow">had interviewed you.</font>

445
00:26:42,903 --> 00:26:45,181
<font color="yellow">Yeah, Claire made some joke</font>
<font color="yellow">about you being banged up</font>

446
00:26:45,183 --> 00:26:47,343
<font color="yellow">when I asked her where you were.</font>

447
00:26:48,703 --> 00:26:51,341
<font color="yellow">Apparently, a detective came</font>
<font color="yellow">to the office the other day?</font>

448
00:26:51,343 --> 00:26:53,053
Yeah, I didn't wanna worry you.

449
00:26:54,103 --> 00:26:55,183
<font color="yellow">What was it about?</font>

450
00:27:00,183 --> 00:27:01,372
Not that.

451
00:27:02,573 --> 00:27:04,343
<font color="yellow">No?</font>
No.

452
00:27:05,933 --> 00:27:09,133
There's nothing that's ever gonna be
able to connect us to that now.

453
00:27:11,573 --> 00:27:13,183
Promise.

454
00:27:15,292 --> 00:27:18,931
<font color="yellow">So what was it about?</font>
Oh, just some weird...

455
00:27:18,933 --> 00:27:21,931
historical case,
some 30-year-old murder.

456
00:27:21,933 --> 00:27:24,181
They thought I might've known
one of the suspects.

457
00:27:24,183 --> 00:27:26,461
<font color="yellow">Jesus. Did you?</font>

458
00:27:26,463 --> 00:27:27,731
No, of course not.

459
00:27:27,733 --> 00:27:31,183
The interview lasted five minutes,
it's fine.

460
00:27:32,292 --> 00:27:34,013
I'm gonna go up and see the lad.

461
00:27:44,903 --> 00:27:46,981
CASS: 30th March 1990.

462
00:27:46,983 --> 00:27:50,131
The day of your passing-out parade.
You remember it? <font color="cyan">Of course.</font>

463
00:27:50,133 --> 00:27:52,292
Good day?
<font color="cyan">Lovely.</font>

464
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:56,101
Proud of your achievement?
<font color="cyan">Very.</font>

465
00:27:56,103 --> 00:27:59,370
So why no family there?
To share your day with you.

466
00:27:59,372 --> 00:28:01,101
HE CHUCKLES

467
00:28:01,103 --> 00:28:04,461
<font color="cyan">Er, because I was supposed to be</font>
<font color="cyan">a doctor or a lawyer or...</font>

468
00:28:04,463 --> 00:28:06,620
<font color="cyan">go into the family business,</font>
<font color="cyan">apparently.</font>

469
00:28:06,622 --> 00:28:07,931
And how did that make you feel,

470
00:28:07,933 --> 00:28:10,211
that no-one came to celebrate
with you?

471
00:28:10,213 --> 00:28:14,620
<font color="cyan">Sad, but I knew they'd come round,</font>
<font color="cyan">which they did, I think.</font>

472
00:28:14,622 --> 00:28:16,133
<font color="cyan">They're very proud of me now.</font>

473
00:28:17,773 --> 00:28:21,341
<font color="yellow">You went to a party that night.</font>
<font color="cyan">Yeah.</font>

474
00:28:21,343 --> 00:28:25,131
<font color="yellow">Erm, do you remember</font>
<font color="yellow">who you went with? </font><font color="cyan">No.</font>

475
00:28:25,133 --> 00:28:29,620
<font color="yellow">Or what time you left?</font>
<font color="cyan">30 years later? No, sorry.</font>

476
00:28:29,622 --> 00:28:32,103
<font color="yellow">OK. Erm, do you remember</font>
<font color="yellow">who you left with?</font>

477
00:28:33,183 --> 00:28:36,771
<font color="cyan">A couple of them, yeah.</font>
<font color="yellow">OK, who was that?</font>

478
00:28:36,773 --> 00:28:40,542
<font color="cyan">Rob and Liz - Fogerty and Baildon.</font>
<font color="yellow">OK.</font>

479
00:28:42,983 --> 00:28:44,540
<font color="yellow">Well, completely understandably,</font>

480
00:28:44,542 --> 00:28:48,101
<font color="yellow">you couldn't remember</font>
<font color="yellow">who you went with, but, er...</font>

481
00:28:48,103 --> 00:28:49,771
<font color="yellow">quickly remembered</font>
<font color="yellow">who you left with.</font>

482
00:28:49,773 --> 00:28:52,821
<font color="yellow">Is there a reason that those names</font>
<font color="yellow">have stuck in your mind?</font>

483
00:28:52,823 --> 00:28:55,211
<font color="cyan">Because of something that happened</font>
<font color="cyan">that night.</font>

484
00:28:55,213 --> 00:28:57,181
<font color="yellow">What was that?</font>

485
00:28:57,183 --> 00:28:59,051
<font color="cyan">Er, so...</font>

486
00:28:59,053 --> 00:29:03,261
<font color="cyan">Rob, who was our designated driver,</font>

487
00:29:03,263 --> 00:29:04,651
<font color="cyan">unbeknownst to any of us,</font>

488
00:29:04,653 --> 00:29:07,101
<font color="cyan">had actually had a few drinks</font>
<font color="cyan">that night.</font>

489
00:29:07,103 --> 00:29:09,461
<font color="cyan">Dumb luck on the way back into town,</font>
<font color="cyan">he got pulled over</font>

490
00:29:09,463 --> 00:29:11,290
<font color="cyan">by the traffic cop,</font>
<font color="cyan">he was breathalysed,</font>

491
00:29:11,292 --> 00:29:14,013
<font color="cyan">was over the limit and...</font>
<font color="cyan">he was nicked.</font>

492
00:29:15,133 --> 00:29:16,981
<font color="cyan">Ended his career</font>
<font color="cyan">before it even started.</font>

493
00:29:16,983 --> 00:29:18,651
<font color="yellow">So he got nicked, he got taken away,</font>

494
00:29:18,653 --> 00:29:21,693
<font color="yellow">how did you then get home</font>
<font color="yellow">after that? </font><font color="cyan">I think...</font>

495
00:29:23,013 --> 00:29:25,492
<font color="cyan">..Lizzie was allowed to drive</font>
<font color="cyan">Rob's car, I think...</font>

496
00:29:26,903 --> 00:29:29,331
<font color="cyan">..she dropped us off in town first</font>

497
00:29:29,333 --> 00:29:31,821
<font color="cyan">and then dropped Rob's car</font>
<font color="cyan">at his house.</font>

498
00:29:31,823 --> 00:29:35,011
<font color="yellow">And, erm...</font>
<font color="yellow">you still see Liz Baildon?</font>

499
00:29:35,013 --> 00:29:37,651
<font color="cyan">No. I mean, at the odd police event,</font>
<font color="cyan">but no more than that.</font>

500
00:29:37,653 --> 00:29:40,933
<font color="yellow">Have you discussed this with her</font>
<font color="yellow">over the past few days? </font><font color="cyan">No.</font>

501
00:29:42,622 --> 00:29:47,013
<font color="yellow">OK. Because your recollections</font>
<font color="yellow">are... pretty much identical.</font>

502
00:29:48,292 --> 00:29:51,331
<font color="cyan">Mm, yeah. It's what happened, so...</font>
HE CHUCKLES

503
00:29:51,333 --> 00:29:53,620
<font color="yellow">And you don't remember</font>
<font color="yellow">any of the people in the car?</font>

504
00:29:53,622 --> 00:29:55,211
<font color="cyan">No.</font>

505
00:29:55,213 --> 00:29:57,933
<font color="yellow">Dean Barton? Fiona Grayson?</font>

506
00:29:59,333 --> 00:30:00,903
<font color="cyan">Mm... I'm sorry.</font>

507
00:30:02,103 --> 00:30:04,490
<font color="yellow">And when the car was stopped</font>
<font color="yellow">by the police officer,</font>

508
00:30:04,492 --> 00:30:07,901
<font color="yellow">was that the first time that journey</font>
<font color="yellow">that it had stopped?</font>

509
00:30:07,903 --> 00:30:10,013
<font color="cyan">Yeah.</font>
<font color="yellow">OK.</font>

510
00:30:12,542 --> 00:30:15,691
So, I'm gonna show you
a photo of a man now.

511
00:30:15,693 --> 00:30:19,981
The victim in this investigation,
in fact. Name of Matthew Walsh.

512
00:30:19,983 --> 00:30:22,651
And I'd just like to know
if his face

513
00:30:22,653 --> 00:30:24,103
is in any way familiar to you.

514
00:30:25,653 --> 00:30:27,133
TENSE STING

515
00:30:28,213 --> 00:30:29,213
<font color="cyan">No.</font>

516
00:30:31,013 --> 00:30:32,292
Well, have a good look.

517
00:30:35,983 --> 00:30:37,103
<font color="cyan">No.</font>

518
00:30:38,263 --> 00:30:40,211
OK.

519
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:44,131
I ask because we have a witness
who says he saw a car

520
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:47,461
with five people in it,
one unusually tall man,

521
00:30:47,463 --> 00:30:50,691
two women and an Asian man
pull up near a patch of ground

522
00:30:50,693 --> 00:30:52,540
called Napley Green.

523
00:30:52,542 --> 00:30:54,410
Now, this is about a mile before

524
00:30:54,412 --> 00:30:57,131
where you were pulled over
by the traffic cop.

525
00:30:57,133 --> 00:30:59,490
And the witness says
that one of the men,

526
00:30:59,492 --> 00:31:03,791
that matches your description,
got out, calling, "Oi, Walshy boy!"

527
00:31:03,793 --> 00:31:06,921
and then chased after the victim.
<font color="cyan">Ss...</font>

528
00:31:06,923 --> 00:31:08,711
<font color="cyan">So, is your witness white?</font>

529
00:31:08,713 --> 00:31:10,310
What does that have to do
with anything?

530
00:31:10,312 --> 00:31:12,671
<font color="cyan">OK, I'm not being funny or anything,</font>
<font color="cyan">but to them,</font>

531
00:31:12,673 --> 00:31:14,071
<font color="cyan">we do all slightly look the same.</font>

532
00:31:14,073 --> 00:31:16,591
So you don't recognise this event?

533
00:31:16,593 --> 00:31:20,281
You don't recognise the name,
Matthew Walsh, or indeed his face?

534
00:31:20,283 --> 00:31:21,991
In fact, none of this
rings any bells?

535
00:31:21,993 --> 00:31:23,512
<font color="cyan">No, I'm sorry.</font>
OK.

536
00:31:24,642 --> 00:31:28,201
So, I think that you know
perfectly well who Matthew Walsh is,

537
00:31:28,203 --> 00:31:29,281
and I think you know him

538
00:31:29,283 --> 00:31:31,481
because only three weeks
before this incident,

539
00:31:31,483 --> 00:31:33,430
I think you had
a racially instigated fight with him

540
00:31:33,432 --> 00:31:36,481
in a pub in Hendon. <font color="cyan">What evidence</font>
<font color="cyan">have you got for this allegation?</font>

541
00:31:36,483 --> 00:31:38,871
This was in The Ifield.
<font color="cyan">Yeah. What evidence?</font>

542
00:31:38,873 --> 00:31:40,711
Did you used to drink in there?
HE SCOFFS

543
00:31:40,713 --> 00:31:43,673
<font color="cyan">Listen...</font>
HE LAUGHS

544
00:31:44,873 --> 00:31:48,671
<font color="cyan">..I don't know where you're</font>
<font color="cyan">coming from with all this, but...</font>

545
00:31:48,673 --> 00:31:50,711
<font color="cyan">I'll give you the benefit</font>
<font color="cyan">of the doubt</font>

546
00:31:50,713 --> 00:31:53,281
<font color="cyan">and assume it's not from</font>
<font color="cyan">the same place as 90% of the crap</font>

547
00:31:53,283 --> 00:31:55,483
<font color="cyan">I have to deal with comes from...</font>
<font color="cyan">but...</font>

548
00:31:58,673 --> 00:31:59,953
<font color="cyan">..you have nothing here.</font>

549
00:32:01,033 --> 00:32:05,121
<font color="cyan">I mean, a witness comes out of the</font>
<font color="cyan">woodwork 30 years after the event</font>

550
00:32:05,123 --> 00:32:07,310
<font color="cyan">and says he saw an Asian guy</font>
<font color="cyan">get out of a car,</font>

551
00:32:07,312 --> 00:32:09,560
<font color="cyan">and then a random Paki in a pub?</font>

552
00:32:09,562 --> 00:32:11,033
HE CHUCKLES
<font color="cyan">Are you serious?</font>

553
00:32:14,673 --> 00:32:16,993
<font color="cyan">Sorry, guys,</font>
<font color="cyan">but I think we're done here.</font>

554
00:32:28,673 --> 00:32:29,991
Don't, just...

555
00:32:29,993 --> 00:32:32,430
<font color="yellow">I just think we need</font>
<font color="yellow">to slow down, boss.</font>

556
00:32:32,432 --> 00:32:34,312
I just want it over.

557
00:32:35,673 --> 00:32:37,123
I shouldn't even be here.

558
00:32:55,873 --> 00:32:59,281
<font color="#008000">So I heard her, the other day.</font>

559
00:32:59,283 --> 00:33:01,673
<font color="#008000">The police officer with you.</font>

560
00:33:02,923 --> 00:33:04,432
<font color="cyan">I'm sorry?</font>
<font color="#008000">Me too.</font>

561
00:33:05,632 --> 00:33:07,512
<font color="#008000">That I have to resort to this.</font>

562
00:33:09,123 --> 00:33:10,993
<font color="#008000">You should've been better,</font>
<font color="#008000">Elizabeth.</font>

563
00:33:13,233 --> 00:33:15,073
<font color="cyan">I'm sorry, Eugenia.</font>

564
00:33:16,673 --> 00:33:19,711
<font color="cyan">I have no idea</font>
<font color="cyan">what you're talking about.</font>

565
00:33:19,713 --> 00:33:22,991
<font color="#008000">I'm not a greedy person.</font>
<font color="#008000">I don't want luxuries.</font>

566
00:33:22,993 --> 00:33:26,481
<font color="#008000">But I do want to be able</font>
<font color="#008000">to heat our flat,</font>

567
00:33:26,483 --> 00:33:30,031
<font color="#008000">to feed my child properly,</font>
<font color="#008000">and once in a while,</font>

568
00:33:30,033 --> 00:33:33,793
<font color="#008000">very rarely,</font>
<font color="#008000">buy her a pretty dress from Primark.</font>

569
00:33:35,283 --> 00:33:38,921
<font color="#008000">So, really, not a lot.</font>
<font color="#008000">And a fraction of what you have.</font>

570
00:33:38,923 --> 00:33:41,310
<font color="#008000">But still, apparently,</font>
<font color="#008000">too much for you.</font>

571
00:33:41,312 --> 00:33:44,673
<font color="cyan">No, I didn't say that.</font>
<font color="#008000">£287.</font>

572
00:33:45,762 --> 00:33:49,713
<font color="#008000">My overdue gas bill.</font>
<font color="#008000">And £9 an hour.</font>

573
00:33:52,153 --> 00:33:55,401
<font color="#008000">That's what I'm blackmailing you</font>
<font color="#008000">for.</font>

574
00:33:55,403 --> 00:33:57,351
<font color="#008000">Which sounds pathetic.</font>

575
00:33:57,353 --> 00:33:58,632
<font color="#008000">Even to me.</font>

576
00:33:59,713 --> 00:34:02,271
<font color="#008000">But if you don't give me this,</font>
<font color="#008000">I will tell the police</font>

577
00:34:02,273 --> 00:34:03,593
<font color="#008000">what your mother told me.</font>

578
00:34:05,273 --> 00:34:06,843
<font color="#008000">Which I don't think you want.</font>

579
00:34:08,993 --> 00:34:10,023
<font color="#008000">So...</font>

580
00:34:11,203 --> 00:34:13,630
<font color="#008000">..have a think and then maybe...</font>

581
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:17,403
<font color="cyan">No, I don't have to have a think.</font>
<font color="cyan">You can have it.</font>

582
00:34:34,762 --> 00:34:35,953
Hey!

583
00:34:43,762 --> 00:34:45,630
<font color="yellow">I just had a call from my brother.</font>

584
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:48,591
<font color="yellow">He said he could not,</font>
<font color="yellow">in all conscience,</font>

585
00:34:48,593 --> 00:34:51,351
<font color="yellow">keep what you told him from me.</font>

586
00:34:51,353 --> 00:34:56,231
<font color="yellow">And so, I was just wondering...</font>
<font color="yellow">if you had a conscience.</font>

587
00:34:56,233 --> 00:34:59,871
<font color="yellow">I was just wondering if you felt</font>
<font color="yellow">you could maybe give your partner</font>

588
00:34:59,873 --> 00:35:02,483
<font color="yellow">a bit of a heads up</font>
<font color="yellow">as to what the fuck was going on.</font>

589
00:35:17,432 --> 00:35:19,713
27 years ago...

590
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:25,233
..I killed a child.

591
00:35:29,827 --> 00:35:34,188
They said I was speeding.
Doing 42 in a 30-mile area.

592
00:35:35,418 --> 00:35:38,138
And I lost control
going round a corner.

593
00:35:39,628 --> 00:35:42,218
I actually think she was
on the wrong side of the road.

594
00:35:43,697 --> 00:35:46,577
Either way... we collided.

595
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:50,216
And there was a toddler in the back.

596
00:35:50,218 --> 00:35:51,498
In a car seat.

597
00:35:52,657 --> 00:35:54,298
It wasn't properly fastened.

598
00:35:55,938 --> 00:35:57,088
And he died.

599
00:35:58,657 --> 00:35:59,858
The little boy.

600
00:36:01,188 --> 00:36:06,018
And I received a conviction
for death by dangerous driving.

601
00:36:09,378 --> 00:36:13,575
<font color="yellow">How... how could you never</font>
<font color="yellow">have told me this?</font>

602
00:36:13,577 --> 00:36:16,058
I know, I'm so, so, so sorry.

603
00:36:18,978 --> 00:36:22,298
<font color="yellow">Was it your fault?</font>
I don't think so.

604
00:36:24,298 --> 00:36:26,498
But I'm not sure
I'll ever really know.

605
00:36:29,418 --> 00:36:31,548
<font color="yellow">I'm just stunned, Fi, that you...</font>

606
00:36:32,728 --> 00:36:38,336
<font color="yellow">..felt you could keep something</font>
<font color="yellow">so significant from me for 17 years,</font>

607
00:36:38,338 --> 00:36:40,266
<font color="yellow">how do you do that?</font>

608
00:36:40,268 --> 00:36:43,188
<font color="yellow">How do you do that and stay sane?</font>
<font color="yellow">I mean...</font>

609
00:36:45,777 --> 00:36:47,697
<font color="yellow">..is there anything else</font>
<font color="yellow">you need to tell me?</font>

610
00:36:50,188 --> 00:36:51,907
No. That's it.

611
00:36:58,088 --> 00:37:01,498
<font color="yellow">If we lose our deposit...</font>
<font color="yellow">I swear, Fiona...</font>

612
00:37:09,468 --> 00:37:12,086
RAM: <font color="cyan">I mean, what do people want</font>
<font color="cyan">the police to be?</font>

613
00:37:12,088 --> 00:37:13,548
<font color="cyan">Mm?</font>

614
00:37:14,548 --> 00:37:16,726
<font color="cyan">Do they want us to be like them,</font>

615
00:37:16,728 --> 00:37:19,936
<font color="cyan">just normal human beings</font>
<font color="cyan">who will screw up,</font>

616
00:37:19,938 --> 00:37:23,186
<font color="cyan">who will make mistakes?</font>
<font color="cyan">We all accept that.</font>

617
00:37:23,188 --> 00:37:26,466
<font color="cyan">We all say sorry and move on,</font>
<font color="cyan">and that's the deal.</font>

618
00:37:26,468 --> 00:37:28,016
HE SIGHS

619
00:37:28,018 --> 00:37:30,575
<font color="cyan">Or do they want to believe</font>
<font color="cyan">that we're not the same,</font>

620
00:37:30,577 --> 00:37:33,825
<font color="cyan">that we've got some kind</font>
<font color="cyan">of special powers that they don't?</font>

621
00:37:33,827 --> 00:37:36,468
<font color="cyan">Cos, you know, that makes them</font>
<font color="cyan">feel safer in their beds.</font>

622
00:37:39,577 --> 00:37:41,058
<font color="cyan">What do they want?</font>

623
00:37:42,368 --> 00:37:45,366
<font color="cyan">Cos it's got to be one or the other.</font>
<font color="cyan">It can't be both.</font>

624
00:37:45,368 --> 00:37:47,546
Mate, I can't even work
the Apple remote, so...

625
00:37:47,548 --> 00:37:48,827
HE LAUGHS

626
00:37:54,548 --> 00:37:56,657
DRINK BEING POURED

627
00:37:58,657 --> 00:38:00,018
Hey, what's the matter?

628
00:38:01,548 --> 00:38:02,697
Hey, hey, hey.

629
00:38:05,498 --> 00:38:06,728
What's wrong, babe?

630
00:38:08,268 --> 00:38:09,907
<font color="yellow">Do you ever get angry, Dean?</font>

631
00:38:11,577 --> 00:38:13,777
<font color="yellow">At Jack.</font>
At Jack?

632
00:38:15,978 --> 00:38:18,938
<font color="yellow">Yeah, and I don't just mean</font>
<font color="yellow">for being naughty, I mean for...</font>

633
00:38:21,108 --> 00:38:22,468
<font color="yellow">..for being him.</font>

634
00:38:24,498 --> 00:38:26,498
Erm, no. No.

635
00:38:30,418 --> 00:38:31,618
<font color="yellow">I do.</font>

636
00:38:32,978 --> 00:38:35,188
<font color="yellow">Sometimes, not often, like...</font>

637
00:38:37,058 --> 00:38:40,827
<font color="yellow">..half a dozen times</font>
<font color="yellow">in his entire life, maybe I, erm...</font>

638
00:38:44,827 --> 00:38:46,008
<font color="yellow">I blame him.</font>

639
00:38:47,827 --> 00:38:50,858
<font color="yellow">I blame HIM, not his disability.</font>

640
00:38:55,978 --> 00:38:58,726
<font color="yellow">For what I tell myself</font>
<font color="yellow">he's stolen from us.</font>

641
00:38:58,728 --> 00:39:01,138
<font color="yellow">From you, from me.</font>

642
00:39:02,258 --> 00:39:05,138
<font color="yellow">From Cass. </font>Marn...
<font color="yellow">And I am telling you this, Dean...</font>

643
00:39:07,907 --> 00:39:11,056
<font color="yellow">..because I want you to know</font>
<font color="yellow">that I am not who you think I am.</font>

644
00:39:11,058 --> 00:39:15,006
<font color="yellow">That part of me</font>
<font color="yellow">is just an awful person.</font>

645
00:39:15,008 --> 00:39:19,256
<font color="yellow">But an awful person who,</font>
<font color="yellow">well, at least, I hope,</font>

646
00:39:19,258 --> 00:39:22,546
<font color="yellow">despite what I have just told you,</font>
<font color="yellow">you still love.</font>

647
00:39:22,548 --> 00:39:24,136
Of course.

648
00:39:24,138 --> 00:39:28,695
<font color="yellow">So, surely, surely,</font>
<font color="yellow">that means you can tell me stuff.</font>

649
00:39:28,697 --> 00:39:30,138
<font color="yellow">About your past.</font>

650
00:39:32,468 --> 00:39:34,728
<font color="yellow">And about your family -</font>
<font color="yellow">whoever they are.</font>

651
00:39:37,218 --> 00:39:40,338
<font color="yellow">Things that maybe you think</font>
<font color="yellow">will make me...</font>

652
00:39:41,498 --> 00:39:46,258
<font color="yellow">..hate you or fear you or whatever,</font>
<font color="yellow">I dunno, because it just won't.</font>

653
00:39:49,058 --> 00:39:52,546
<font color="yellow">But what is killing me</font>
<font color="yellow">is the secrets.</font>

654
00:39:52,548 --> 00:39:55,138
<font color="yellow">The years of secrets.</font>

655
00:39:56,368 --> 00:40:01,577
<font color="yellow">Of writing a Mother's Day card</font>
<font color="yellow">to a mother you told me had died.</font>

656
00:40:03,008 --> 00:40:04,616
<font color="yellow">Going to Calais</font>
<font color="yellow">when we were supposed</font>

657
00:40:04,618 --> 00:40:06,336
<font color="yellow">to have given up all that crap</font>
<font color="yellow">years ago.</font>

658
00:40:06,338 --> 00:40:09,895
<font color="yellow">Lying about where you are today,</font>
<font color="yellow">I can't take it anymore.</font>

659
00:40:09,897 --> 00:40:12,416
<font color="yellow">I just can't take the secrets</font>
<font color="yellow">and lies,</font>

660
00:40:12,418 --> 00:40:15,056
<font color="yellow">not when we've got so much else</font>
<font color="yellow">to deal with.</font>

661
00:40:15,058 --> 00:40:17,697
<font color="yellow">So, please... just talk to me, Dean.</font>

662
00:40:19,748 --> 00:40:22,766
You're tired, Marn. I am too.
<font color="yellow">No, Dean.</font>

663
00:40:22,768 --> 00:40:25,726
We will do this... but not now.

664
00:40:25,728 --> 00:40:28,618
Please.
<font color="yellow">Dean. </font>Please.

665
00:40:33,258 --> 00:40:36,108
<font color="#008000">He's just down there at the end.</font>
<font color="cyan">OK. Cheers, mate.</font>

666
00:40:51,897 --> 00:40:53,466
<font color="cyan">So, those are the original files</font>

667
00:40:53,468 --> 00:40:56,645
<font color="cyan">connected to Fiona Grayson's</font>
<font color="cyan">driving conviction in '93.</font>

668
00:40:56,647 --> 00:41:00,256
<font color="cyan">And it turns out that a child died</font>
<font color="cyan">during this incident</font>

669
00:41:00,258 --> 00:41:02,496
<font color="cyan">in the car that she collided with.</font>
<font color="yellow">Wow.</font>

670
00:41:02,498 --> 00:41:05,336
<font color="cyan">One of the officers attending</font>
<font color="cyan">smelt alcohol on Fiona's breath,</font>

671
00:41:05,338 --> 00:41:07,645
<font color="cyan">and so obviously tried to give her</font>
<font color="cyan">a test at the time,</font>

672
00:41:07,647 --> 00:41:09,856
<font color="cyan">but she was so upset,</font>
<font color="cyan">crying hysterically,</font>

673
00:41:09,858 --> 00:41:12,186
<font color="cyan">that they were unable</font>
<font color="cyan">to successfully give her one</font>

674
00:41:12,188 --> 00:41:14,746
<font color="cyan">at the scene, so she was arrested</font>
<font color="cyan">and taken to the local nick</font>

675
00:41:14,748 --> 00:41:17,336
<font color="cyan">where a blood test was taken</font>
<font color="cyan">there instead. </font><font color="yellow">And?</font>

676
00:41:17,338 --> 00:41:21,216
<font color="cyan">It was lost. </font>Lost?
Lost where, the lab or the nick?

677
00:41:21,218 --> 00:41:23,056
<font color="cyan">The nick.</font>
<font color="cyan">Before it got sent to the lab.</font>

678
00:41:23,058 --> 00:41:24,336
Which nick was this?

679
00:41:24,338 --> 00:41:26,695
<font color="cyan">Kingston. </font>Are you heading
where I think you're heading?

680
00:41:26,697 --> 00:41:29,775
<font color="cyan">So I checked where both Ram Sidhu</font>
<font color="cyan">and Liz Baildon worked at the time.</font>

681
00:41:29,777 --> 00:41:34,056
And? <font color="cyan">Baildon worked</font>
<font color="cyan">at Kingston nick from '91 to '94.</font>

682
00:41:34,058 --> 00:41:38,775
<font color="yellow">Oh, man. </font><font color="cyan">Yep. And in the '91 census,</font>
<font color="cyan">it details Liz and Fiona</font>

683
00:41:38,777 --> 00:41:41,416
<font color="cyan">as living at the same address</font>
<font color="cyan">in Thames Ditton,</font>

684
00:41:41,418 --> 00:41:43,595
<font color="cyan">about a mile or so</font>
<font color="cyan">from Kingston town centre.</font>

685
00:41:43,597 --> 00:41:44,915
<font color="cyan">But at the time of this offence,</font>

686
00:41:44,917 --> 00:41:48,136
<font color="cyan">they're living at separate addresses</font>
<font color="cyan">but both are still in the same area.</font>

687
00:41:48,138 --> 00:41:50,746
<font color="yellow">If that blood test</font>
<font color="yellow">had come back positive,</font>

688
00:41:50,748 --> 00:41:53,416
<font color="yellow">Fiona Grayson would be in jail.</font>
<font color="cyan">Definitely.</font>

689
00:41:53,418 --> 00:41:55,746
OK, so there are three explanations
here.

690
00:41:55,748 --> 00:41:57,858
One, this was just a coincidence.

691
00:41:59,498 --> 00:42:02,895
Two, they were an item
and she contrived

692
00:42:02,897 --> 00:42:06,825
to have the blood sample lost
for personal reasons.

693
00:42:06,827 --> 00:42:08,288
And then, three...

694
00:42:09,748 --> 00:42:11,138
..they weren't an item...

695
00:42:12,498 --> 00:42:14,136
..but Liz Baildon was blackmailed.

696
00:42:14,138 --> 00:42:17,056
Fiona Grayson using whatever
the fuck happened with Matthew Walsh

697
00:42:17,058 --> 00:42:19,858
as some kind of... leverage.

698
00:42:21,468 --> 00:42:23,645
<font color="yellow">I know what my money's on.</font>
<font color="cyan">Mm.</font>

699
00:42:23,647 --> 00:42:25,108
PHONE RINGS

700
00:42:27,858 --> 00:42:28,936
Leanne.

701
00:42:28,938 --> 00:42:31,645
<font color="#008000">Hey. Cass. Any chance</font>
<font color="#008000">you could pop in for five minutes</font>

702
00:42:31,647 --> 00:42:32,858
<font color="#008000">when you have a chance?</font>

703
00:42:35,008 --> 00:42:36,218
<font color="cyan">What can I say?</font>

704
00:42:37,618 --> 00:42:42,748
<font color="cyan">Just now, we found out, just now,</font>
<font color="cyan">this actually happened.</font>

705
00:42:46,697 --> 00:42:50,058
<font color="cyan">I feel differently.</font>
Oh, Jesus, Ram. <font color="cyan">I know.</font>

706
00:42:51,258 --> 00:42:53,216
<font color="cyan">I'm sorry, but...</font>

707
00:42:53,218 --> 00:42:56,746
I've just spent the last seven days
slightly killing myself mentally

708
00:42:56,748 --> 00:42:58,138
to get to where you were.

709
00:43:00,108 --> 00:43:02,136
Trying somehow to find a way
of thinking

710
00:43:02,138 --> 00:43:04,577
that we didn't have
to do this thing.

711
00:43:06,777 --> 00:43:07,948
This brutal...

712
00:43:09,198 --> 00:43:11,288
..really horrible thing.

713
00:43:13,827 --> 00:43:15,976
You just changed your mind.
<font color="cyan">No.</font>

714
00:43:15,978 --> 00:43:19,288
<font color="cyan">I... I just, erm...</font>

715
00:43:21,388 --> 00:43:22,976
HE EXHALES

716
00:43:22,978 --> 00:43:27,006
<font color="cyan">What if something happened to me?</font>
<font color="cyan">What if I got ill or...</font>

717
00:43:27,008 --> 00:43:30,976
<font color="cyan">I don't know, anything, that meant</font>
<font color="cyan">you had to do it all on your own?</font>

718
00:43:30,978 --> 00:43:34,575
<font color="cyan">You know, I just started to think</font>
<font color="cyan">how difficult that would be for you.</font>

719
00:43:34,577 --> 00:43:37,216
<font color="cyan">I mean, I'm not definitely saying</font>
<font color="cyan">we do go for termination,</font>

720
00:43:37,218 --> 00:43:40,178
<font color="cyan">I'm not saying that yet,</font>
<font color="cyan">I'm just saying... can we...?</font>

721
00:43:41,468 --> 00:43:44,618
<font color="cyan">We can keep thinking...</font>
<font color="cyan">for a bit longer.</font>

722
00:43:52,538 --> 00:43:53,538
<font color="cyan">OK.</font>

723
00:43:55,338 --> 00:43:57,695
OK, am I seeing
what I think I'm seeing?

724
00:43:57,697 --> 00:44:04,176
<font color="#008000">So, I'm seeing a sharp-ended object</font>
<font color="#008000">approximately ten centimetres long,</font>

725
00:44:04,178 --> 00:44:08,536
<font color="#008000">maybe three quarters of a centimetre</font>
<font color="#008000">wide inside the skull cavity.</font>

726
00:44:08,538 --> 00:44:10,746
And what do we think that is?
<font color="#008000">No idea.</font>

727
00:44:10,748 --> 00:44:13,825
<font color="#008000">I need to open the skull up now.</font>
<font color="yellow">It got in pre or postmortem?</font>

728
00:44:13,827 --> 00:44:16,136
<font color="#008000">Again, I don't know</font>
<font color="#008000">until I open it up.</font>

729
00:44:16,138 --> 00:44:19,176
But best guess? <font color="#008000">From its position,</font>
<font color="#008000">you would logically assume</font>

730
00:44:19,178 --> 00:44:21,336
<font color="#008000">it entered through</font>
<font color="#008000">the temporal bone fracture,</font>

731
00:44:21,338 --> 00:44:23,106
<font color="#008000">which, when I examined it properly,</font>

732
00:44:23,108 --> 00:44:26,695
<font color="#008000">actually contained remnants</font>
<font color="#008000">of brick dust, so...</font>

733
00:44:26,697 --> 00:44:28,216
<font color="#008000">two theories,</font>

734
00:44:28,218 --> 00:44:31,316
<font color="#008000">firstly, he was being chased</font>
<font color="#008000">and at some point,</font>

735
00:44:31,318 --> 00:44:34,646
<font color="#008000">he tripped and fell,</font>
<font color="#008000">hitting his head on a wall,</font>

736
00:44:34,648 --> 00:44:37,226
<font color="#008000">which maybe had a metal spike</font>
<font color="#008000">of some sort,</font>

737
00:44:37,228 --> 00:44:40,426
<font color="#008000">an old bolt from some railings</font>
<font color="#008000">or whatever,</font>

738
00:44:40,428 --> 00:44:43,986
<font color="#008000">and this is what killed him,</font>
<font color="#008000">breaking off inside the skull.</font>

739
00:44:43,988 --> 00:44:45,785
<font color="#008000">Or...</font>

740
00:44:45,787 --> 00:44:47,986
<font color="#008000">he tripped and fell,</font>
<font color="#008000">hitting his head,</font>

741
00:44:47,988 --> 00:44:51,116
<font color="#008000">which rendered him unconscious</font>
<font color="#008000">and, whilst unconscious,</font>

742
00:44:51,118 --> 00:44:55,116
<font color="#008000">he was basically stabbed through</font>
<font color="#008000">the head wound with this object.</font>

743
00:44:55,118 --> 00:44:57,936
<font color="yellow">Jeez.</font>
<font color="#008000">Yeah. </font>So...

744
00:44:57,938 --> 00:45:03,348
first theory, the chase that went
tragically, but accidentally, wrong.

745
00:45:06,018 --> 00:45:10,268
Second theory...
this was no accident.

746
00:45:11,787 --> 00:45:16,068
This was a very violent
and very deliberate...

747
00:45:17,398 --> 00:45:19,508
..murder.
<font color="#008000">Correct.</font>

747
00:45:20,305 --> 00:46:20,170
