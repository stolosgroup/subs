1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:03,190
David Walker died as a
result of a single stab wound.

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:04,670
We're looking for his killer.

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,470
I don't recognise him, I'm afraid.

4
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:08,790
Do you think there's a
chance that he was a client

5
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:10,310
when you worked as a prostitute?

6
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,590
Please say you don't
need to tell anyone this.

7
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,390
I'm trying to think of other reasons

8
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,550
why a man would have a
prostitute's address.

9
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,470
It's the same conversation a
wife would have with her husband.

10
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,470
We didn't row and it
didn't get out of hand

11
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,310
and I didn't accidentally kill him.

12
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:26,350
This travel card was found
in an office desk of his.

13
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,430
That definitely a six,
or could it be a zero?

14
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,390
I didn't ring Zoe's parents, sweetheart.

15
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,990
I would never do something like that.

16
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,270
I just thought your temper
issues were so in the past.

17
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,310
- How much?
- £5,000.

18
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,750
If we tell Janet, we could lose Flo.

19
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,550
Sorry, no. No idea.

20
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,670
I was working in the
city at the time, so...

21
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,790
- As a lawyer?
- Banker, I'm afraid.

22
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,750
I've spoken to the friend
again about David's problems.

23
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,950
He said he'd been abused at his
primary school by a teacher.

24
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,074

So, if David was at primary
school in the mid-'50s,

33
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,750
we'd be looking at a possible
abuser who's, what, in their...

34
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,750
- early 80s now? - Which obviously rules out
any of the people we're currently talking to.

35
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,350
Unless the murder was committed
on behalf of the abuser.

36
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,630
What, the primary school
teacher ordered a hit?

37
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,270
Walker allegedly confronted
him 25 years later.

38
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,510
The teacher could have
been anything by then.

39
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,270
And with everything to lose if
David had gone to the police.

40
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,590
Well, look, let's keep
an open mind about that.

41
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,830
OK, so, Colin Osborne,

42
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:18,830
he worked at Klein Egerton in the
late '80s, but then he leaves...

43
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:23,070
very suddenly. It's only about a
month or so before David died.

44
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,270
Now, it's probably a complete coincidence,

45
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:28,190
- but can you speak to
them, please? - Yeah.

46
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,270
And then Sara Alazi, so, she says

47
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:36,440
that she was living in Rome between
erm... March and December 1990.

48
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,110
Can you speak to the
border agency and see if...

49
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,150
how we can confirm that?

50
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,190
- Yeah.
- Well, I think...

51
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,910
Yeah, that's it.

52
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:51,360
Thanks, everyone, go
home now... and sleep.

53
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:02,310
OK, listen, tell you what, you put
your pyjamas on, brush your teeth,

54
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,270
I'll be back upstairs in two minutes,

55
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,120
you show me what a big grown-up
girl you are, OK? Good girl.

56
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,580
One other option.

57
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,980
You let him go to the police...

58
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,510
.. and then you just deny it.

59
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,470
You're a lawyer, he's a drug addict

60
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,350
who's just had his stepdaughter
taken away from him.

61
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,350
Why on Earth would the
police believe a word he says?

62
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,270
And what if there was CCTV
in the supermarket car park,

63
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:37,320
- or another witness... - We could
easily check the CC... - No.

64
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,790
Sorry.

65
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,640
But... this is the simplest way.

66
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,960
I love you.

67
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,560
And have you told me everything, Col?

68
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,950
- What do you mean?
- That thing you do...

69
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,280
.. that you've always done.

70
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,310
That part of you you keep from me.

71
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,200
I've told you everything, I promise.

72
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,040
Coming, ready or not.

73
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,480
Tess, I think we should
postpone the holiday.

74
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:36,150
- Why? - I just think none of us
are in the right frame of mind,

75
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:39,350
- you won't be able to relax and...
- Why would I not be able to relax?

76
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,910
- Because of what's happening
at your work. - Work's fine.

77
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,470
Why would I not be able to relax?

78
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,720
Do you know what he said
to her before we arrived?

79
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,910
- About wanting to hurt someone?
- Listen...

80
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,430
Jason is angry and confused.

81
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,150
And I get that, of course I do,

82
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:57,230
and you also have to get how
that might spook a 15-year-old.

83
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,910
Well, yeah, maybe, until her dad
very quickly reassured her that

84
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,270
Jason is simply trying to process
an incredibly traumatic event.

85
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,270
And that, actually, he is the gentlest...

86
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,560
kindest man in the world,
which obviously you did, yeah?

87
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,910
Sure.

88
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,440
Yeah. Good.

89
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,670
And are you OK?

90
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,390
Ch...

91
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,710
I'm as fine as a woman

92
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:28,510
who's just learnt her late husband
was murdered is ever gonna be.

93
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,960
Paul, you don't seem to be
really understanding that.

94
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,000
Well, no.

95
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,710
No, I have to admit I am finding
certain things a little surprising.

96
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,830
Oh, right. Well, what things are those?

97
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,950
Well, this all happened
nearly 30 years ago,

98
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,200
it's another lifetime ago...

99
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,670
.. but it seems to be
really affecting you.

100
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,430
Oh, right, OK. And there's
a manual, is there,

101
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,350
on how to deal with something like this?

102
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,190
Am I not following the manual, Paul?

103
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,110
I don't know, but...

104
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,990
.. I have to admit, you are...

105
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,880
beginning to ever-so-slightly scare me.

106
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,230
Scare you?

107
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:09,980
And I'm wondering if there's
anything you need to tell me.

108
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,320
No.

109
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,340
There's nothing I need to tell you.

110
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,060
Sara, how nice to see you.

111
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,760
Is everything OK? Sara?

112
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,200
Hello.

113
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,320
I'll come down. Thank you.

114
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,390
- Jason?
- Hi.

115
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,310
Hi, er... I'm DCI Cassie Stuart,

116
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,670
I'm leading the investigation
into your father's death.

117
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,660
Can I just say how sorry
I am for your loss?

118
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,860
Erm... thank you.

119
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,110
Would... Would you like to erm...

120
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,550
go and find somewhere a bit more private?

121
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,600
No, I just... I just wanted to
know when I could visit him.

122
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,120
Right.

123
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:50,240
Are you really sure that's a good idea?

124
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,750
He's my dad.

125
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,540
No, I understand.

126
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:00,680
Better surely to...
remember him how he was.

127
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,200
Except I don't... hardly...

128
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,470
.. remember him how he was.

129
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,830
I mean, my mum made me a
memory box after he went,

130
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,350
with lots of stuff of his in it...

131
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,350
.. and there's a jumper in it that I
used to smell to remind me of him.

132
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,270
Except it's gone now, the smell.

133
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,460
I used it all up, I guess.

134
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:28,030
And I actually need to... see him.

135
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,680
I just... I just wanna be with him.

136
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,380
OK? I want to say goodbye.

137
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,840
Can you leave this with me?

138
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Have you got a number
I can call you back on?

139
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,070
Yeah, erm... use the mobile.

140
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,220
Right. I'll come back
to you as soon as I can.

141
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,710
Thank you, DCI Stuart.

142
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,600
Cassie, please, and really,
there's no need for thanks.

143
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,840
All right, see you.

144
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,590
And what year would that
have been, Mr Gregory?

145
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,150
Er... well, from when he was about seven

146
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,430
till when the teacher
left... about a year later.

147
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,550
- So, that would be, what, 1958,'59?
- Roughly.

148
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,750
- Did Mr Walker give you
the teacher's name? - No.

149
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,600
Or if he did tell me, I don't remember it.

150
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,630
Sorry to ask this, but did he ever

151
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,670
give you any specific
details about the abuse?

152
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,880
It was bad. Proper...

153
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,920
.. rape and stuff.

154
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,350
Did he ever report it? I mean,
is there any record of it?

155
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,270
As far as I know, he told no-one.

156
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,910
I mean... kids just didn't then,
did they? Just kept it all in.

157
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,950
Now, you said to a colleague
of mine that you...

158
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,270
"often thought it was why he
lived his life the way he did."

159
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,350
- What did you mean by that?
- The women...

160
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,760
the drink and drugs to blot
it all out, all that...

161
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,960
- .. shame and guilt.
- So, he had drug issues?

162
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,790
Yeah, you could say that.

163
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,350
And did he have relationships
outside his marriage?

164
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,880
Yes, he... he did have affairs...

165
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,300
.. but mainly I was
talking about prostitutes.

166
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,110
- Right. - In fact, that's kind of
why we stopped seeing each other.

167
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,710
I wasn't remotely interested
in that sort of thing

168
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,070
and we just kind of drifted apart.

169
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,320
- And this was when?
- Mid-'80s, I guess.

170
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,750
But then in about '87,

171
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:51,100
he rang me, out of the blue,
and we hooked up again.

172
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,870
We went out for a beer a few times,

173
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,230
which was when he told me about Firdown,

174
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,910
the school where it all happened.

175
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,510
Do you happen to know if
he ever told his wife about

176
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,390
the things that happened to him there?

177
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,790
He told me he'd never been able to.

178
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:09,190
For whatever reason, the only
people he ever spoke to about it

179
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:14,040
were me and... when he tracked
him down, the teacher himself.

180
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,910
So you know for a fact that
he actually spoke to him?

181
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:22,270
He found out where he
lived, went to his house.

182
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,750
- And what did the teacher say?
- Denied it all, of course.

183
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,880
Then got abusive... then threatened him.

184
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:05,620
My PA was meant to have called
you, I'm so sorry, total cock-up.

185
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,340
But my hands are tied, Tess.

186
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:13,410
If you have access to any intelligence
relating to the investigation,

187
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:15,930
and it turned out that you were...

188
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,440
.. in some way...

189
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:22,540
So, you can take a back-office role.

190
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:27,300
HR, training, or take some
time off, take some leave.

191
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:34,140
I'll stay.

192
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,500
This was him about a year before he died.

193
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:49,260
No, I don't recognise
him, I'm afraid. Sorry.

194
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:56,650
So, can you think of any reason

195
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:01,180
erm... why this address might have
been written on a travel card...

196
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,850
.. found in his office desk?

197
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,220
Ooh.

198
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:11,810
- Absolutely no idea.
- When did you say he died?

199
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:15,340
We think some time in
about early May 1990.

200
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,770
Well, maybe the person that wrote this

201
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:21,250
just wrote down the wrong address.

202
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,300
Well, that's certainly a
very real possibility.

203
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:30,410
So, can I just check if anyone
else was living here in 1990?

204
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:34,700
Oh, it would have been just me and
my husband. He's passed away now.

205
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:40,090
Hang on. When was that time
Daddy and I were in America

206
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:42,140
and Marion broke in?

207
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,570
Mum was winding me up and I
knew it'd annoy the arse off her

208
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:54,220
to tell her that you meant
more to me than her, so I did.

209
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:58,090
Which is very sweet of you, Zoe, and
you mean an awful lot to me, too,

210
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:01,080
but all I'm saying, all
anyone is saying...

211
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:04,610
.. is we just need to keep
that relationship professional

212
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:07,460
and within the boundaries of the hospital.

213
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,500
Soz.

214
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:25,130
- I owe you an apology.
- What for?

215
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:28,170
It was Zoe who told her parents
about the phone conversation.

216
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:31,700
Oh, right, not a problem. Listen,
that's not why I'm calling.

217
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:35,640
A police officer's just been round here.

218
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:39,490
- Sorry? - Yeah, she'd already
been round to your mum's,

219
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:42,140
and then Elise gave her our address.

220
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:46,810
- What did she want? - She said she
was investigating an historic crime

221
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:50,260
and that she wanted to ask
you a couple of questions.

222
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:57,530
She didn't tell me anything
more than that, so I rang Elise.

223
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,810
She said she'd been
trying to get hold of you

224
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,970
but your mobile went
straight to voicemail.

225
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:04,370
- I was on the ward.
- But Elise said she'd told her

226
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:07,780
that it was about a murder
dating back to 1990.

227
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:11,880
They've only just found
the body apparently.

228
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:17,810
So, her married name is Kelsey,
but she was single in 1990,

229
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:20,090
so can you run a check
under her maiden name,

230
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:23,490
- which is "Marion Dunphy"?
- OK.

231
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,890
And how did it go with James Gregory?

232
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:28,450
Interesting. Er... according to him,

233
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:32,380
David definitely did use prostitutes
and on a fairly industrial level.

234
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:37,220
Jesus. Do you know, I just...
I met his son this morning?

235
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:39,650
What a nightmare this is gonna be for him.

236
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:44,420
- It's gonna get worse. Walker was
into some really weird stuff. - Like?

237
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,610
Violent kind of weird.

238
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:49,410
Tying up, S&M stuff.

239
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:53,090
And did Gregory think
his wife knew about it?

240
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:55,080
Erm... he thinks not.

241
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:58,930
So, the other possibility is that
he went too far with Sara Mahmoud

242
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,610
and she... she attacked him back,

243
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:04,980
and then he died as she tried
to defend herself somehow.

244
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,980
Er... OK. OK, can we just be...

245
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,930
.. very careful how we share
this information for now?

246
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:18,090
- Yeah, of course.
- Obviously, we'll need to

247
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:21,570
speak to Sara Mahmoud,
again, and Tessa Nixon.

248
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:22,850
Yeah, I'll set up both.

249
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,970
Oh, and what about
Firdown, David's school?

250
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:27,960
- Well, I spoke to the
current head. - And?

251
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:30,730
She was suitably appalled.
I mean, without a name

252
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,490
she wasn't sure how she could help us.

253
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,890
This is abuse that is
alleged to have occurred

254
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,730
about 10 years before pretty much

255
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:39,010
the oldest current teacher was even born.

256
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,330
Right.

257
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:44,890
Even identifying a possible suspect
is gonna be as good as impossible.

258
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:47,050
On top of that, there's
a really good chance

259
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:50,050
that whoever David Walker was
talking about is already dead.

260
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,570
Hm. Right, OK. I'll see you later.

261
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,930
Colin Osborne and I both
started on the same day,

262
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:27,210
and we were kids, really.

263
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:29,890
I'd come straight from
Cambridge, Colin from Kingston.

264
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:33,490
- They recruited from a poly?
- Oh, they took Colin. - Because?

265
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:36,690
He got the highest marks in the
aptitude test anyone had ever scored.

266
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:39,490
- And he went on to do well here?
- He did extremely well.

267
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:41,090
He worked ridiculously hard,

268
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:43,770
but more importantly, he had serious nuts.

269
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:46,410
If he'd stayed, he'd have
ended up running the place.

270
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:49,050
Did you get any sense of why
he did leave so suddenly?

271
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:52,290
No, I mean, I worked
with him and I liked him,

272
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:56,210
but I didn't really know him well,
he was quite a reserved man.

273
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:59,360
One day, he was here, the
next, he was just gone?

274
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:02,660
Have you spoken to Colin about this?

275
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:05,690
Mr Osborne's helping
us with our enquiries.

276
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:08,850
I'd need to take advice before
answering any more questions.

277
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:11,930
I'm not sure of our position
on discussing Colin's departure.

278
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:14,410
What's the best number
for me to contact you on?

279
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:17,330
Why don't I call you when you've
spoken to who you need to?

280
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:19,980
What's the best number to get you on?

281
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:40,890
If you could call us back when you
pick this up, please, Mrs Mahmoud,

282
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:42,770
it'd be good to talk further.

283
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,290
Thank you.

284
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:49,530
'If you could call us back when you
pick this up, please, Mrs Mahmoud,'

285
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:51,850
it'd be good to talk further.

286
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:14,740
Colin?

287
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:20,180
Sorry, drifted off for a minute.
Erm... what were you saying?

288
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:25,450
Er... Janet was just asking if there
are any issues, any difficulties,

289
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:29,090
anything at all that we feel it
would be useful for her to know.

290
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:31,340
No, no difficulties at all.

291
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:36,250
And how we doing at bedtimes?

292
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,580
- Us or Flo?
- Both.

293
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:42,170
Yeah, no, good as gold, really.

294
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:45,530
She sleeps really well and is
full of beans in the morning.

295
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,250
And how are her nightmares?

296
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,010
Hasn't had any.

297
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:52,780
I think everything really changed
when we got her here full-time...

298
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:29,010
- Hi, there. Marion Kelsey?
- Hello.

299
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:30,860
DCI Cassie Stuart?

300
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:33,890
Have you got five minutes
for a quick chat?

301
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,900
Ooh, yes. Yeah, sure.

302
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,730
No, sorry. Who is he?

303
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:52,060
His name was David Walker.

304
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:56,780
He ran a small chain of clubs in the '80s.

305
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,570
I've never been a clubber myself.

306
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:05,490
No, me neither.

307
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:08,480
- The music's always
too loud for me. - Mm.

308
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:15,380
Well, obviously, as you know, we've
spoken to your mum and sister...

309
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:20,410
.. and she seemed to think that you
might have been living in her house

310
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:23,940
- at some point in early 1990?
- Did she say I broke in?

311
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,570
Well, she did, yes, actually.

312
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,570
My father was on a lecture tour
of America for three months

313
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:33,220
and I was temporarily homeless, so...

314
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:36,410
.. I had a key, let myself in
and stayed there for a few days,

315
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:38,930
- if that's breaking in.
- Sure.

316
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:40,490
Well, as you say,

317
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:43,170
it couldn't have been her
that gave that address out

318
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:46,420
because she was abroad,
so could it have been you?

319
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,220
Sure.

320
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,020
Oh, OK, erm...

321
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:55,340
.. but you don't have any
recollection of doing so?

322
00:21:55,940 --> 00:22:00,130
- From some time in 1990? No, sorry.
- OK, no problem.

323
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:05,770
- So, your mum said that you
left home in about 1985? - Yep.

324
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:08,410
- And you stayed in London?
- Yeah.

325
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,690
Whereabouts?

326
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,910
Various places.

327
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:16,810
And was 32 Smoke Lane one of them?

328
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:20,560
I was there for a while, yeah.

329
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:23,090
This was the address,
in fact, that you gave

330
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:27,450
after you were arrested in 1988
for assaulting a police officer...

331
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,690
I never assaulted anyone.

332
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,650
.. at a demonstration in North London.

333
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:33,050
A policeman attacked me,
I was defending myself.

334
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,770
For which you were found guilty

335
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:38,220
at Horseferry Road Magistrates'
Court and fined £100.

336
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,170
You look like a smart woman to me.

337
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:46,450
I'm sure you couldn't
be so spectacularly dim

338
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,090
as to suggest that a police
officer from the '80s...

339
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:52,090
well, fuck it, from any point
in the last 50 years, actually,

340
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,940
couldn't have lied?

341
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:56,890
I'm not sure why you're
being so defensive, Marion.

342
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:59,770
I'm being defensive because I
was on a perfectly legal march,

343
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:03,210
exercising my right to protest, and
I was assaulted by a police officer.

344
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:06,730
And you're now trying to imply that
I have some kind of violent past,

345
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:09,370
and that therefore, I must
be connected in some way

346
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:12,050
to this unfortunate man's tragic death.

347
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,170
And I find that annoying, I'm sorry.

348
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,130
Are we done? Cos I have a very busy ward.

349
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,650
- Sure.
- Great. Nice to meet you.

350
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:20,800
And you. And if we need
to speak to you again...

351
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,840
.. we'll be in touch.

352
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,910
So, there are no records that can
confirm whether Sara Mahmoud/Alazi

353
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,270
was or wasn't in the UK.

354
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,230
We're checking with all the main airlines

355
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,910
for flights to Rome in March 1990,

356
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,990
but I've been told not to hold my breath.

357
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:43,310
OK, keep pushing them, we do
need to be able to confirm

358
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,870
where she was at the time
of David Walker's death.

359
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,710
- Absolutely. - I've left her
a message to call us back.

360
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:52,310
OK. Jake, where are we with the photos?

361
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:55,150
I went through Tessa Nixon's,
unfortunately, she said

362
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,910
she chucked out most of the ones
of her husband about 15 years ago.

363
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,310
- Why? - "Trying to lay ghosts to
rest," she said. - Or bury them.

364
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:05,350
And I'm still waiting to hear
back from the Tory Party offices

365
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,430
- about their photo archive.
- OK. Murray?

366
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,550
I spoke to a senior guy
at Klein Egerton today

367
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,550
and there's definitely something
odd about Colin's departure.

368
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,630
I don't know what it is, but I'm
guessing they're gonna close ranks.

369
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,830
- I'm on it.
- Right, good stuff.

370
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:24,800
OK, following my rather prickly
chat with Marion Kelsey earlier...

371
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,390
.. we ran a tenancy check
on the Smoke Lane address,

372
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:36,950
and we've found... yes, one
rather... interesting result.

373
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,720
So, this is... Sinead Mary Quinn.

374
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:46,750
Now, she lived at Smoke
Lane from 1988 to 1991.

375
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,600
And then in 1992...

376
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,550
.. Miss Quinn was in prison for 10 years

377
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,870
for her role in suspected IRA activities.

378
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,590
So, we then went back to
Marion Kelsey's arrest sheet

379
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:02,310
and discovered that the march she was on

380
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,750
was actually a protest march

381
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,150
campaigning for the release
of the Guildford Four.

382
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,790
So, we have one IRA activist,

383
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:12,230
we have the murder of a
Tory Party fundraiser,

384
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,350
and linking them both...

385
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,630
.. we have Marion Kelsey.

386
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:22,840
What did you tell them? What
did you fucking tell them?

387
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,790
Oi. So, since when did
Monster Truck Mayhem

388
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,110
become part of the maths syllabus?

389
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,760
- It's problem-solving, innit?
- Oh.

390
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,830
- Confiscated, mate.
- Dad.

391
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:55,070
He's addicted to this, we're gonna
have to send him to the Priory.

392
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,630
Omar rang me this morning,

393
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,070
said thank you for not
sticking the petition back up.

394
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,470
I apologised on your behalf

395
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,950
and told him that it must
have been an oversight

396
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,630
and that it would straight
back up first thing tomorrow.

397
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,470
Love?

398
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:17,120
Yeah, sorry. Back to normal tomorrow.

399
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,920
- It was a joke.
- Sorry, I'm tired.

400
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:25,430
Do you want help with the interview later?

401
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,480
Yeah, thanks.

402
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,560
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, fine.

403
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,640
- Hass?
- Yeah.

404
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:44,790
I do love you.

405
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,430
Well, luckily, I do love you, too.

406
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,800
Lots.

407
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,390
Hey.

408
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,350
What are you doing here?

409
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,340
Nice to see you, too.

410
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,640
- It's our local.
- Our local?

411
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,470
The other kids on the ward.

412
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,950
Just trying to work out how many
things are wrong with that sentence.

413
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,430
They don't serve anyone under 16,
they don't let us get twatted,

414
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,150
and they make us sit out the
back so no-one can see us.

415
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:21,230
We tell 'em, "What's the worst that
can happen? We've all got cancer."

416
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,510
Have you forgotten what we
discussed this afternoon?

417
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:29,990
This is hospital grounds. Near as, anyway.

418
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,180
Malibu and orange, please.

419
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,790
She sounded out of control, Tony.

420
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:46,510
I mean, Mum was completely
petrified, as was I.

421
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,870
I'm so sorry.

422
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:51,470
We never thought about why
she came back when she did,

423
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:54,710
we were just so grateful that she did.

424
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:57,990
But, I mean, you know, you
don't think that she could...

425
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:01,040
No, no, I don't. She could never have...

426
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,840
No.

427
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:09,390
- Look, I'll erm... I'll call you
as soon as she gets in, OK? - OK.

428
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,240
- Bye.
- Bye.

429
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,430
'Hi, this is Marion.'

430
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,830
'I can't take your call right
now, please leave a message.'

431
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:27,470
Why aren't you at home talking
to your husband about it?

432
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,990
Talking to my husband about what?

433
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,800
Whatever it is that's making you unhappy.

434
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,990
Who says I'm unhappy?

435
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,790
You're a 48-year-old woman
necking vodkas on your own

436
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,510
90 minutes after your shift has ended.

437
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,940
Do you think you know me, Zoe?

438
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,400
- No. - Do you really think you have
the first idea of who I really am?

439
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,480
No, but I know fear.

440
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,080
Trust me... I can spot fear a mile away.

441
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,750
Hey.

442
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,740
Hey, it's gonna be OK.

443
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,910
You have no idea.

444
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,430
Marion, please, please don't cry.

445
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,750
- I've gotta go.
- You can talk to me.

446
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,230
Really, can I?

447
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:28,070
Please, I wanna help you.

448
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:31,390
You're not my friend, Zoe,
you're not my daughter,

449
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,920
you're just another patient who I'll
forget about as soon as you've gone.

450
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,240
Grow up.

451
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,830
And what did Tessa say?

452
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,280
That she had absolutely no idea.

453
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:55,830
'And did you believe her?'

454
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:59,990
Well, it's hard to tell on the phone
but she seemed pretty stunned,

455
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:03,150
so my guess is that
James Gregory was right,

456
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,790
David Walker never told her
anything about the abuse.

457
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:09,870
And did she give a reason for why she never
gave us his best friend's name and number?

458
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:13,350
Well, she said she didn't consider
Gregory to be a close friend.

459
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,950
Which is er... fair enough, I suppose,

460
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,710
given the little contact
that he and Walker had had.

461
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,150
Or she just didn't want us to speak to him

462
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,830
because what he told
us gives her a motive.

463
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,590
Maybe.

464
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,350
Ah, listen, boss, I've gotta go,

465
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,550
I need to shout at my children.

466
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,070
We also need to find Sinead Quinn.

467
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,310
Yeah, first thing.

468
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,700
- Night, Sunny.
- Night, boss.

469
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,630
- Hiya.
- Oh.

470
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:55,780
- You scared me.
- Ditto. I've been calling you.

471
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:59,230
Yeah, sorry, my phone was out of juice.

472
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,510
How'd it go with the policewoman?

473
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,760
Oh, yeah. No, it was fine...

474
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,920
- .. I didn't know the guy,
so short and sweet. - Right.

475
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,670
So where have you been? Your shift
finishes at 6:00, didn't it?

476
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,820
I went out with the girls,
we had a few bevvies.

477
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,150
- Right, I'm gonna have a bath.
- Maz?

478
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:32,200
I've never pressed you, have
I, to talk about the past?

479
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,550
All those years you never
saw your family, I...

480
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,070
I've always just accepted that...

481
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:43,030
.. it was a part of you that
you didn't wanna re-visit.

482
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:47,190
But your sister rang and she
said you were so unpleasant today

483
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,310
to her and to your mum...

484
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,840
.. and I need to ask you...

485
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:57,240
.. is there anything you wanna talk about?

486
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:05,550
You make the past sound so much more
interesting than it really is, Tony.

487
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,230
Yeah, my parents liked
my sister more than me.

488
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,390
They got her in a way they didn't get me,

489
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:13,110
and that makes me angry and so we row.

490
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,920
And that's it, I'm afraid,
it's all rather boring.

491
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,990
- Please don't walk away.
- No, I'm tired and I want a bath.

492
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,830
No, Maz. Every time...

493
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:26,550
all our life, whenever the
conversation gets difficult,

494
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:29,470
- you just walk away.
- Don't be tedious, love.

495
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,460
Or get nasty. Or both.

496
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,940
You know, one day,
you're gonna come back...

497
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,360
.. and find me gone.

498
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,710
Hiya.

499
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:15,870
Hiya, love. Sorry, I thought
you'd gone to bed already.

500
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:18,160
- Good day?
- Yep.

501
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,910
- You? - Yeah, yeah.
You're late tonight.

502
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:25,360
You said when I was 70, I
could stay out until 11:00.

503
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,870
Sorry.

504
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,750
What were you doing in Winchester, Dad?

505
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:35,510
I... I accidentally opened
one of your bank statements.

506
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:39,270
I saw a debit card payment
to South West Trains.

507
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:42,520
- For a copper, you're a shit liar.
- Yeah, I got it from you.

508
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,790
All right, I'll tell you, but...

509
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,840
I'd prefer not to talk
about it afterwards...

510
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:54,280
- .. because I know what
you're gonna say. - Deal.

511
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:59,300
- I was looking for the bloke.
- What bloke?

512
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,400
The one your mum was seeing.

513
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,700
- Are you serious?
- Yep.

514
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,160
OK. Why?

515
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:19,920
You see, that's... that's why
I didn't wanna tell you...

516
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,270
.. because I knew you wouldn't understand.

517
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,070
I'm just asking why, I'm not
saying I don't understand.

518
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:28,150
Well, yes, the fact
that you need to ask why,

519
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:31,360
- you are saying exactly that.
- So, did you find him?

520
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:38,000
- Oh, I'm gonna go to bed.
Goodnight, love. - Dad?

521
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,270
Dad, don't be like that.

522
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,360
Dad. Dad?

523
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,270
This is it.

524
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,030
There's no more coming.

525
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:10,190
We don't want any more.

526
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,710
Thank you.

527
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:29,480
I will be a good father,
Tyler, and I am a good man...

528
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,320
.. but if you ever do anything to
jeopardise our adoption of Flo...

529
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:39,380
.. if you ever threaten my
family's future happiness again...

530
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,480
.. I will hurt you.

531
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,840
I will hurt you very fucking badly.

532
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,070
What is going on, Colin?

533
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,350
Why didn't you tell me before?

534
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:08,430
That I was also being interviewed
in connection with a murder?

535
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:12,190
I was terrified, Simon, and if
Tyler had gone to the police

536
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,150
and told them about me keying the car,

537
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:17,560
and some sharp-eyed copper had
cross-referenced the two cases...

538
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:24,030
.. Janet and her department would
be about to finalise an adoption

539
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:27,230
by a man being interviewed in
connection with two violent crimes.

540
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,710
And we would have lost her, Simon.

541
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,700
But I swear, I know
nothing about this body.

542
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:37,350
On Flo's life, I have
never heard of David Walker

543
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:40,360
and I have absolutely no idea how he died.

544
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,590
- Boss?
- Mm, yeah.

545
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:49,190
I've just got these from
Fulham Party Headquarters.

546
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:52,110
They erm... had these in old scrapbooks

547
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:56,230
from the publicity of various
magazines and newspapers.

548
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,790
The er... society sections.

549
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:03,080
Er... this one is from Hello!
Magazine, the diary section.

550
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,780
But look at the caption below.

551
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,030
"Nightlife supremo David Walker...

552
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:21,270
.. and party donor Colin Osborne
at the CP Valentine's Day Ball".

553
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:25,000
The plot thickens, boss. The
plot bloody well thickens.

554
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:35,930
"So, tell us, Miss Mahmoud,
the recent Ofsted report

555
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:39,690
identified Highbrook as having
a serious truancy problem,

556
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:44,370
particularly for the boys
in the 13 to 15 age range.

557
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:46,250
What measures would you put in place

558
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:49,100
to help motivate these boys to attend..."

559
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:51,890
Sara, what's the matter?

560
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:55,900
You've been acting really weird the last
couple of days. What is it? Talk to me.

561
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:00,740
Not here.

562
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:22,980
I honestly have no recollection
of ever having met this man.

563
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:27,290
OK, er... no problem.

564
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:31,130
Can we go back then to when
you left Klein Egerton.

565
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:33,730
When we spoke to you before, you implied

566
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:37,050
- that you'd just had a
change of heart? - I had.

567
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:40,490
We then spoke to a Hugh Moray,

568
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:42,570
who was a colleague of yours at the bank.

569
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:44,330
We sensed from him that,

570
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:46,890
actually, there was more
to your departure than that.

571
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:49,970
- You sensed?
- He seemed reluctant to talk about it.

572
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:53,810
- Well, he always was a decent guy.
- Because he covered your back?

573
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:56,260
Because he respected my privacy.

574
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:00,700
So, when did you start
training to become a lawyer?

575
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:02,930
Later that year.

576
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:08,100
That's October 1990,
that's according to your...

577
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:12,170
- .. company website.
- That sounds about right.

578
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:14,690
So, what did you do in
the seven months off?

579
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:17,840
- Where were you living?
- Why does it matter?

580
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:21,610
OK. It matters, Colin,
because I want to know

581
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:25,060
where you were and what you were
doing when David Walker was murdered.

582
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:34,000
You won't know this, but er...

583
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:37,570
.. my partner and I...

584
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:41,250
my husband are in the final
stages of adopting a child.

585
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:45,100
And... whilst I've...

586
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:49,050
.. I've never been dishonest
with the adoption authorities,

587
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:54,420
there is one fact that I
haven't told them about.

588
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:59,050
And I truly believe that
has no bearing whatsoever

589
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:01,900
on my capabilities as a potential father.

590
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:13,180
I left Klein Egerton because
I had a breakdown and...

591
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:18,410
.. from early May until September 1990,

592
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:23,060
I was sectioned in the Maudsley
Hospital in South London.

593
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:29,530
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

594
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:34,500
- And there would be medical records
to confirm this, would there? - Yes.

595
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:39,010
And you were sectioned
because you were considered

596
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:40,770
to be a danger to yourself or...

597
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:43,410
A danger to myself, yes, no-one else.

598
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:47,090
And this... this breakdown
was caused by what?

599
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:49,410
I had a history of anxiety...

600
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:54,860
.. and stress, and erm...
it just came to a head.

601
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:59,740
Can you remember exactly when
this was, when you went in?

602
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:05,180
Well, the date you're sectioned
is not a date you easily forget.

603
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:08,920
6th of May, 1990.

604
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:19,210
Pretty solid alibi.

605
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:21,970
Fancy a quick coffee?
Pick the bones out of that.

606
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:25,530
Yeah. Erm... actually, I've
got a date down here, erm...

607
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:28,570
so you head back, I'll get the train
and maybe we can discuss later?

608
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:31,410
Hm. Yeah, no, right. Fine.

609
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:33,530
I'm sorry, I didn't know if she'd respond.

610
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:36,780
No, no. I've got to meet
Walker's son anyway, so...

611
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:39,490
Yeah, we'll talk later.

612
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:41,890
I can give you a call about 9:00?

613
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:46,040
- Yeah, only if that suits you.
- Yeah, no, I'm sure it... does.

614
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:48,460
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

615
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:02,650
Everything's absolutely fine, I promise.

616
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:04,730
But do the police think she did anything?

617
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:06,810
Absolutely not, they just have to ask

618
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:10,380
difficult questions of anyone who
ever knew him, it's just procedure.

619
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:13,930
- Do you want a snack?
- No, thanks.

620
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:16,650
OK. Well, crack on with your revision.

621
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:32,490
The police came to see me
at the school the other day.

622
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:35,410
They're investigating the
murder of a man in 1990

623
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:38,300
who they believed I had a connection with.

624
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:45,720
And I know nothing about
how he died, but...

625
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:49,660
.. I probably did know him.

626
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:55,680
And I knew him...

627
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:01,080
.. because...

628
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:05,210
.. many years before I met you...

629
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:10,500
.. and at a very low point in my life...

630
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:16,760
.. I'd had sex with him...

631
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:21,720
.. for money.

632
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:09,890
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

633
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:14,180
- Do you want me to come in?
- No, thank you.

634
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:21,940
Take as long as you need.

634
00:44:22,305 --> 00:45:22,309
