1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:04,390
David did use prostitutes,
on a fairly industrial level.

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,870
I'd had sex with him. For money.

3
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:10,790
I was cleared of any involvement in my
husband's disappearance 26 years ago.

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,550
You are beginning to scare me.

5
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,910
I just want to know when I
can visit him. He's my dad.

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,110
"Nightlife supremo David Walker
and party donor Colin Osborne."

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,590
I'm not sure of our position,
discussing Colin's departure.

8
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,390
- How much?
- Five thousand.

9
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,310
If you threaten my family's future again,

10
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,390
I will hurt you very badly.

11
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,790
This travel card was found
in an office desk of his.

12
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,750
When was that time Marion broke in?

13
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,310
You're not my friend, Zoe.
You're just another patient

14
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,030
I'll forget as soon as you've gone.

15
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,710
But Elise says you told
her it was about a murder.

16
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,390
What did you tell them?

17
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,070
So we have one IRA activist, Sinead Quinn,

18
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,350
the murder of a Tory party fund-raiser,

19
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,340
and linking them, we have Marion Kelsey.

- Hi.
- Hi.

29
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:04,230
- I thought you'd be asleep.
- Flo had a nightmare.

30
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,270
Oh, no. Is she all right now?

31
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,150
Fine, yeah. I think she's
just feeling a bit unsettled.

32
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,750
Yeah. Sorry about that. The brief
came in just as I was leaving --

33
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,800
Your clerk said you weren't in the office.

34
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,240
Well, I went to the Oaks to
have some supper while I worked.

35
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,190
What was it like, Col?
The City in the '80s?

36
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,240
Was it really as brutal as everyone says?

37
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,190
Why don't you just ask me outright, Simon?

38
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,510
Did it screw me up so much I
could have killed someone?

39
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,560
Did it?

40
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,760
No, it didn't.

41
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,340
I know I've messed up
here, hugely. But please...

42
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,320
.. please, can I never have
to answer that question again?

43
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,520
- Hello.
- Hi.

44
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,000
I went for a drive.

45
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:07,550
To... think how I could explain
to you what happened to me.

46
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,760
What happened to you? Someone
did this to you, did they?

47
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,830
You had nothing to do with the decision?

48
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,820
Of course I had something to do with it.

49
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,990
What I wanted to explain was...

50
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:26,590
.. at that point in my life I
believed -- wrongly, obviously --

51
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,510
that I had no other choice.

52
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:34,150
Since when does becoming a prostitute...

53
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,910
What has to have gone wrong

54
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:43,120
for that to be the best option
available? You weren't a kid, Sara.

55
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,480
This was 1989. You were 21.

56
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,430
And I, I know you lost your parents,

57
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,750
and I know school hadn't
worked out for you,

58
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,800
and I know life had been tough, but this?

59
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,230
So please, please explain to
me what happened in your life

60
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:06,760
that made having sex with men
for money your only option?

61
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,840
I don't know.

62
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,920
I just...

63
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,480
.. I'd lost my way.

64
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,790
This man, the one that died?

65
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,270
I was abroad when he died. It wasn't me.

66
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,830
- Where?
- It was when I was in Italy.

67
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,910
You've heard me talk about Italy
a million times. It was then.

68
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,590
And you can prove that, can
you, with specific dates?

69
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:46,430
- To you, or the police?
- The police.

70
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,680
I don't know. I think so.

71
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,430
I think I have photos,
but I'd need to check.

72
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:56,510
But if I can't, Hass, I
swear on our children's lives

73
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,800
whatever happened to him, it wasn't me.

74
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,670
- I'll sleep in the spare room.
- Please, Hassan --

75
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,910
We never speak to anyone
else about this, Sara.

76
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,390
It never leaves our house.

77
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,000
Please. Ever.

78
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,920
You've... You've broken my heart, my love.

79
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,940
You've broken my heart.

80
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:01,870
Thank you for coming with me.
It helped, having you there.

81
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,630
You know, my kids aren't
much younger than you,

82
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,380
and, um, their dad... he
died when they were little.

83
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,000
And I know it's different
because you've only just learnt,

84
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,150
but if you ever wanted
to, um, compare notes,

85
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,520
you know, over a beer,

86
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,660
I think they'd be very happy to.

87
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:28,790
You... You know there's, um,
something, not... right with me.

88
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:33,070
You... With my, ah... wiring.

89
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,190
So what I'm saying is, um,

90
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,270
that I, I'd like a beer.

91
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,750
But I never really get asked,

92
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,470
so, um, I might be shit at it.

93
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,230
Luckily they're both very good at beer.

94
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,430
So I'm sure they could show you the ropes.

95
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,070
Shall I text you some dates?

96
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:58,110
- Yeah, I'd, I'd like that.
- OK.

97
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,760
Thanks again.

98
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,990
- Hope you feel better.
- Thanks, sweetheart.

99
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,750
- Bye, Mum.
- Bye.

100
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,120
- Yousef?
- I'm late.

101
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,950
.. and we haven't been able to
locate any details of your movements

102
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,190
between your last contact with David
and when you reported him missing.

103
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,190
Is it possible that you could
just jot something down for us?

104
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,430
You want me to remember what I was
doing for 48 hours 27 years ago?

105
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:50,040
Tragically, I'm sure those few
days are engrained in your memory.

106
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,470
Yeah. I'll do my best.

107
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,430
Thank you, Tessa.

108
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:58,020
- 'Speak to you soon.'
- Yeah.

109
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,550
OK. So what about Colin?

110
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,910
I presume a place like
the Maudsley is secure?

111
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,950
Well, it'll have secure
units, but it's not a prison,

112
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,870
so I imagine if you wanted
to get out, you could.

113
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,590
To kill a man?

114
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,030
Fran's talking to the hospital today,

115
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,950
checking up on what records they have.

116
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,910
- And any joy with Sinead Quinn?
- Not yet.

117
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,270
We know she was released from Holloway

118
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,230
- under the Good Friday
agreement. - Yeah.

119
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,620
But that's about it so far.

120
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,200
OK.

121
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,990
Marion? Zoe was supposed to
be here for an 11:30 chemo.

122
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,190
Oh. Do you want me to call her parents?

123
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,780
No, it's all right. I'll do it.

124
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,950
Mr Osborne left us in late 1990,
following an incident here

125
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,110
on the evening of March 16, 1990.

126
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,030
An allegation was made
by a temp, Maria Gonzalez,

127
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,830
that at some point during
a bonus celebration party,

128
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:13,470
a serious sexual assault was
perpetrated by Mr Osborne on her

129
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:16,830
in an office lavatory cubicle.

130
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,390
What, sexual assault?

131
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,510
She said he raped her.

132
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,910
Sorry -- we've done a full sweep
of Mr Osborne's criminal history,

133
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,790
and there's no record
of any rape allegation.

134
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,580
Well, no, there -- there wouldn't be.

135
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,540
Um... it was handled internally.

136
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,700
For various reasons, it was
never reported to the police.

137
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:54,360
- Sorry!
- Are you dumb, bruv?

138
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:59,100
Yousef! What's up?

139
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,810
You're not under arrest.

140
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:18,490
You're free to end this
interview whenever you like.

141
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:21,740
I'm just going to ask, Sara, what
sort of services you offered.

142
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,410
Just normal.

143
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:27,930
- Just straight sex?
- Yeah.

144
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:31,080
Which is what your
friend Samira Khan said.

145
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:34,530
However, we do now know

146
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:40,570
that, ah, David Walker's sexual
tastes were not that normal.

147
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:44,900
He both liked to hurt
and be hurt by women.

148
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,690
University College Hospital,

149
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:52,090
less than 100 yards from
your old Kings Cross flat.

150
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:56,170
do you remember attending UCH A&E

151
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:59,250
on 16 February 1990?

152
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:03,090
The same day, in fact,
that you sent your address

153
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:05,540
to David Walker's pager?

154
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,690
No.

155
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,770
The hospital records

156
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:14,330
show that you presented with
a suspected dislocated jaw.

157
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:19,850
You don't recall sustaining
this rather serious injury?

158
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:22,450
Not really.

159
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,250
It was an occupational hazard.

160
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,610
Well, indeed.

161
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:31,620
We were wondering if it was David
Walker that inflicted this injury.

162
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,290
- I don't remember him.
- And next time he turned up,

163
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,010
- he got even more
violent with you -- - No.

164
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:40,730
- -- and in self-defence...
- No. I don't remember this man.

165
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:43,980
When he was murdered,
I was living in Italy.

166
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:49,250
So you say you left the UK in March, Sara,

167
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:52,500
- and went to Europe for nine months.
- I don't "say" it. I did.

168
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:57,970
- Where did you stay?
- Hostels, pensions. I moved around.

169
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:00,010
- Was that on your own?
- Yeah.

170
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:03,540
- Did you work?
- Yeah. In bars and clubs.

171
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:07,530
- So you have no payslips, or...
- It was cash in hand.

172
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:10,170
Did you make any friends
who could vouch for you?

173
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:14,130
I made friends, yeah. The
sort you do on holiday.

174
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:18,050
But none I could remember 30 years later.

175
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,700
Mm.

176
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,810
We just need some proof, Sara,

177
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,570
- that you --
- You've already said.

178
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:30,850
Check passport records,
or however you do it.

179
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:35,090
We're in the process of doing
that. But it's not that easy.

180
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:38,300
So anything else you can give
us will be enormously helpful.

181
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,980
OK. Thank you for your time.

182
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,690
Sorry -- one thing.

183
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:57,650
Just upping sticks like that and
heading off abroad for nine months --

184
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,240
it's quite a big deal, isn't it?

185
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,370
Anything in particular prompt that move?

186
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:07,420
It wasn't any one thing, if
that's what you're implying.

187
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,410
It was my life.

188
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:13,860
I knew if I'd stayed any
longer, I would have died.

189
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,860
And I wanted to live.

190
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,700
We'll be in touch.

191
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,090
Her parents thought she was here.

192
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:41,930
So when I called, they looked
in her room and found her diary.

193
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:44,330
Were you drinking with her two nights ago?

194
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:47,850
Absolutely not. I mean,
I -- I was in the pub,

195
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,530
but I went there on my own.

196
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:51,450
But you told her to
leave? She was under age,

197
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,610
- and it was completely inappropriate?
- Yes, I did.

198
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,730
Then can you explain
why it says in her diary

199
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:58,720
that you bought her a Malibu and orange?

200
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,810
- I bought her one drink.
- Oh.

201
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:05,760
I let her sit with me for two
minutes, and then I left.

202
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:07,210
OK.

203
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,290
Well, I need to speak to my line manager.

204
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,930
- I think you need to go home.
- What?

205
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:14,170
How can you not get, you completely
overstepped the boundaries?

206
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,250
- Nicola, please --
- She's a 17-year-old kid,

207
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:18,050
with a very weakened immune system.

208
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,890
You're meant to be caring for
her, not getting her drunk.

209
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:24,260
- Your judgement's gone.
- I'm so sorry. I, I...

210
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,530
I'm not in a good place at home.

211
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:31,210
A few things in my personal
life that's going wrong.

212
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:34,530
- Can I please speak to the parents?
- No, you're going nowhere near them.

213
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:36,730
They're on their way here,
and they're not happy.

214
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:40,410
- Go home, Marion.
- Did she say anything in her diary

215
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:43,700
- about where she was going?
- No, and she's not answering her phone.

216
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,100
No one has any idea where she is.

217
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:03,250
And it was a woman who
made the allegation?

218
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,090
'Yes. Why?'

219
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:07,480
Because Colin Osborne's gay.

220
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,650
Right...

221
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:13,370
Well, I'm going to try and track her down,

222
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:16,330
and I've got the name of the
lawyer from Klein Egerton

223
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:20,180
who handled it at the time.
I think he's still alive.

224
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:23,700
- We'll speak to you later.
- 'OK, guv.'

225
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:27,970
Maybe it was this that
prompted his breakdown.

226
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:31,520
The timing seems a bit
coincidental, doesn't it?

227
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:35,490
Though how it connects to David Walker...

228
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:40,420
- If it even does.
- If it even does. Yeah.

229
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:56,020
You took your time.

230
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,820
Whatever it is, bro, it can't be that bad.

231
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:09,940
- Mate, I'm telling you.
- Yeah. Except you ain't.

232
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:15,050
You've got to swear, Mus,
you never tell anyone.

233
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,450
Not Ollie, not Piot -- no one.

234
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,980
I promise, man. It's cool.

235
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:39,220
'This is Zoe. Leave a voicemail.'

236
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:55,330
- 'Marion? You OK?'
- I'm in trouble, Tony.

237
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:58,490
- Where are you?
- 'Borough Market.'

238
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:01,260
Stay there. I'm coming now.

239
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:35,580
We need more.

240
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,570
We need to buy furniture and stuff.

241
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:43,100
- We haven't enough.
- I told your boyfriend, no more.

242
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:51,130
- I'll tell about the car.
- Go ahead, tell.

243
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:54,780
You're not getting another
fucking cent out of me.

244
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,490
- 'Boss?'
- Jake.

245
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:46,610
I just had a phone call

246
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:50,090
off the woman that researched the
society photos of David Walker.

247
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:53,810
Right. The woman from the local
conservative party office?

248
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,330
Yeah. Name of Mandy Halcross.

249
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:59,770
It turns out she's worked there for
years in one capacity or another,

250
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:03,650
but her very first job there was in 1989.

251
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:08,170
Her mum ran the canteen, and she
helped out in the summer holidays.

252
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,970
'Right.'

253
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:15,420
So she was 12 years old
in the summer of '89.

254
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:20,450
'She'd never told anyone this before,

255
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,570
because she's always felt too ashamed,

256
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:27,250
but she just told me that during
that five-week holiday period,

257
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,370
on two separate occasions,

258
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:32,220
David Walker sexually assaulted her.'

259
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:39,460
- 'Boss, are you there?'
- Yeah, I'm here.

260
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,850
How credible did you feel she was?

261
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:45,890
Well, there were no witnesses,
there'll be no forensic,

262
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:48,410
the suspect's dead,

263
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:51,540
so all I've got to go on here is instinct.

264
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:54,540
'I believed her.'

265
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:58,170
'It's nearly 30 years since
this happened to her.'

266
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:00,690
I'm the first person she's ever told,

267
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:02,010
and...

268
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:05,330
.. it still ripped her apart when she did.

269
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:08,890
'There are no newspapers involved.
There's no conspiracy website.'

270
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:12,860
'She has absolutely nothing to
gain by telling me what she did.'

271
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:18,100
So yeah, I believed her, 100%.

272
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:23,650
Get everyone together for a full briefing.

273
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:26,700
- We'll be back in half-an-hour.
- 'Guv.'

274
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,150
I don't know the man they're asking
about! I'd never have hurt anyone!

275
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:41,070
I mean, I know you know that, but...

276
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,270
the thing is, the police
found out other stuff

277
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,750
about some people I... hung
about with in the '80s,

278
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,510
- that I shouldn't have.
- What people?

279
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,590
I, I lived in a flat,

280
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,550
I shared a flat, I shared a...

281
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,350
I shared a bed, with a woman...

282
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:59,040
.. called Sinead Quinn, who...

283
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,960
She was a...

284
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:05,560
- .. a Republican.
- What do you mean, a republican?

285
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:10,350
An Irish Republican. IRA.

286
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,790
- No!
- I was fucked up, Tony. I --

287
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,190
- When was this?
- It was in the late '80s.

288
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,310
This -- this is Enniskillen!

289
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,910
This is the Baltic Exchange!
How long were you with her?

290
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,550
- Not more than a year.
- A YEAR?

291
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,830
- I never met -- I never saw any --
- You slept with someone

292
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,950
- who thinks blowing up kids is --
- But like I said,

293
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,230
- I was messed up, Tony.
- Oh, we know you were messed up.

294
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:31,640
We've known for years. What no one
has the remotest idea of is why!

295
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,040
Jesus Christ.

296
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,390
How two sisters, with exactly
the same upbringing --

297
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,990
I was wondering how long it'd be
till you brought my sister in.

298
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,630
- I'm not bringing her in --
- If she's so marvellous, Tony,

299
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:49,120
why didn't you just marry her?
You always wanted to fuck her!

300
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,790
- Do you know, I have no
idea who you are. - Really?

301
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,430
Oh, that's it? Walk away? Off you go!

302
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,480
Bye!

303
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,630
You know what, Marion?

304
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:06,380
I'm beginning to think you
could have done anything!

305
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,910
If he abused a kid,

306
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,430
I don't give a toss what
happened to him in the past.

307
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:14,710
In fact, if he was abused as a
kid, it makes it almost worse.

308
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,760
He'd know. He'd know how appalling it was.

309
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:22,760
Except he would have been a very
messed-up human being himself.

310
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,720
- Obviously.
- Yeah. Sorry, I don't buy that.

311
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,760
What do you mean, you don't buy that?

312
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,190
It's just a fact.

313
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,780
It's not my opinion, it's a f...

314
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,140
Oh, for God's sake. Come on, move, move!

315
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:54,510
- Yus! What's up?
- Oh my days, Jamal.

316
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,910
- You'll never guess what.
- What?

317
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,360
- Well, he told me not
to say anything. - What?

318
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:12,620
Seriously, what do you
mean, you don't buy it?

319
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,750
Do you really want to get into this?

320
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:18,790
A person who's been sexually abused
as a child would be very damaged.

321
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,630
Yes, and? It doesn't give them a
right to abuse other kids, does it?

322
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,630
No, of course it doesn't. Bloody right.

323
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,790
I'm not trying to justify it.

324
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,630
- I mean trying to understand.
- Understanding paedophiles. Nice.

325
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:32,070
No, no. Hang on, hang on.
When a kid who's been abused

326
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,430
goes off the rails and
does something awful,

327
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,470
we don't just dismiss
them as monsters, do we?

328
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:39,670
- No, because they're children.
- Right. Right.

329
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:43,750
So when does that kid suddenly
stop deserving some understanding?

330
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:47,350
Was it on their 10th birthday?
Or their 12th? Their 14th?

331
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,670
- How about when they're an adult?
- Ah -- no.

332
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,110
That's when we let them
take proper responsibility,

333
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,070
punish them and protect society from them.

334
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,870
Why the hell does it also mean
we stop trying to understand them?

335
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:59,590
So maybe they don't do it again.

336
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:03,190
Because most abuse victims
don't go and abuse others.

337
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,190
The ones that do choose to,

338
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,550
and that is definitely
beyond my understanding.

339
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,720
Are we done?

340
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:21,030
So as of today, we are splitting
the investigation into two strands.

341
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,310
The first will follow our
existing line of enquiry,

342
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,550
that one of our persons of
interest murdered David Walker

343
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,110
because of some connection
around the time of his death.

344
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,830
Sara Mahmoud's as a prostitute.

345
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,830
We're looking at a possible
IRA motive with Marion Kelsey.

346
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,350
His wife remains of interest,
for obvious reasons.

347
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,990
And then Colin Osborne,
the only person so far

348
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:44,550
that we've conclusively proved
actually met David Walker.

349
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:47,270
Murray, I want you to focus
all your attention now

350
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:50,150
on finding the Klein Egerton
temp, Maria Gonzalez,

351
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,990
and Fran, we really need
to speak to Sinead Quinn.

352
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:57,070
Any news yet on Colin and
Sara's alibis for May 8?

353
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,510
- We're still waiting on both.
- OK, so keep on that.

354
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:05,480
And then, we move into
very different territory.

355
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:09,430
We already know David
Walker had a lot of secrets.

356
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:13,630
And now it seems we've just found another.

357
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:16,790
So myself, Jake and DI Khan

358
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,670
are starting a second line of enquiry,

359
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,430
to investigate if David
Walker was murdered

360
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,830
not because he was going to
expose what happened to him,

361
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,590
30 years before his death,

362
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,630
and not because of any of these reasons,

363
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,950
but maybe as retribution

364
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,870
for sexual abuse he committed himself.

365
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,790
Now, two of these at least,

366
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:41,550
Colin Osborne and Sara Mahmoud,

367
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,590
have dysfunction in their lives

368
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:46,870
very consistent with childhood trauma.

369
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:50,630
All of them seem to have had some
sort of connection with David Walker

370
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:53,080
in the months before he died.

371
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,790
I think we have to
consider the possibility

372
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:02,030
that one, and maybe all of them,

373
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,590
were victims of David Walker as children,

374
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,390
and then, years later, took their revenge.

375
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:11,790
So I want to interrogate every single
aspect of David Walker's adult life,

376
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,880
from when he left school to when he died.

377
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,750
OK?

378
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,560
- [Yes, ma'am.]
- Thank you.

379
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:33,780
I assume we're going to
speak to the wife first?

380
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,240
Why don't I do her?

381
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:41,280
Start chasing down his past.

382
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,310
Right... but obviously
she can't read anything,

383
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:41,100
because you've got a password on it?

384
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,030
Oh, Jesus, Col.

385
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,420
I kept meaning to. I just --

386
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,990
I forgot. I'm sorry.

387
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:53,750
Right. Well, what is on there, then,
that we need to be worried about?

388
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:59,710
Um, you texted me after I told you
about the police interviewing me.

389
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:05,030
- Oh, you are joking!
Jesus, Colin! - No!

390
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:07,230
OK. Look.

391
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,470
She's a smack addict.

392
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:13,710
Chances are, ten minutes after she
nicked it, she sold it for 20 quid.

393
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,060
Chances are, we will be fine.

394
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:19,030
- Daddy!...
- OK?

395
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:23,200
I think it's all going to
be absolutely fine. Coming!

396
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,470
- How?
- I'm not sure.

397
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,230
I guess he must have heard us last night.

398
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,430
You know, told someone, who told someone.

399
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,350
I think the school might know as well.

400
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:39,140
So we'll have to tell the other two.

401
00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:00,710
My colleague, DI Khan, is
speaking to Mrs Halcross again now.

402
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:03,870
But from the conversation
we've already had with her,

403
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,910
we're fairly confident

404
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:09,200
that we're talking about the
indecent assault of a child under 13.

405
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,550
If this is true, I promise you,

406
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,000
I knew nothing, absolutely
nothing about it.

407
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:25,070
Which is why I know you'll want
to help us as much as you can.

408
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,870
You don't need to use that,

409
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:29,350
that voice we use to make
them think we're their friend.

410
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:32,270
I'll tell you what I know
because I'm a decent person,

411
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,860
not because I think you like me.

412
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:42,160
When we first met, you mentioned
that David did some voluntary work.

413
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,500
What sort of stuff exactly?

414
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,990
He worked at our local hospital,

415
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:57,120
and at a nearby reform school.

416
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:07,680
He did stuff for a local
children's charity.

417
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,940
I'm going to need an exact list, please.

418
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:18,190
Names of the institutions, and dates.

419
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,510
And the... the timeline I asked for,

420
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:24,150
detailing your movements in
the days before his death.

421
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,070
Jason, Jason -- no!

422
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:31,410
- No, he was in tears afterwards.
- 'Ah. Good.'

423
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:34,020
He was incredibly apologetic.

424
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:38,810
I just think he's got enough
crap to deal with right now.

425
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:42,370
- 'Assaulting a police officer...'
- It wasn't an assault.

426
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:44,770
- It's a serious offence, guv.
- 'No, it was an accident.'

427
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,970
'He was... highly emotional.'

428
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:49,730
'I don't care whether it
was an accident or not!'

429
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:51,370
Then fine.

430
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:55,170
Let's just hope he doesn't go on
to do something more serious, eh?

431
00:31:55,220 --> 00:32:00,170
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- 'Night.'

432
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,940
Grub's up.

433
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,900
What is it?

434
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:21,610
You're drying up. What is it you want?

435
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:24,530
Just thought it might make you smile.

436
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:26,290
Cos you haven't, in a while.

437
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:29,540
- That's rubbish. I smile loads.
- Do you?

438
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:33,610
Well, I would, if you two
didn't spend half your lives

439
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,450
trying to drive me round the bloody bend.

440
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:38,220
We don't do it deliberately.

441
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:44,480
I'm sorry, Gem. It's just...

442
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:48,170
I've worked hard, and I'm tired.

443
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:50,210
Do you want us to stay
at Mum's this weekend,

444
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:53,340
- give you some time off?
- No.

445
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:55,900
Not at all.

446
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:11,300
We thought we'd tell you the truth
before you heard it anywhere else.

447
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:14,730
I'll speak to the school tomorrow,
and let them know what's happened.

448
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:17,770
What are my friends gonna say?

449
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:20,850
It might be an idea for you
to take a few days off,

450
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:23,250
till things blow over.

451
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:25,210
You know the way I feel with it, Ali?

452
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:28,450
I just see that woman
as a different person.

453
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:31,530
Sara Alazi was not your mum.

454
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:35,610
Sara Mahmoud is who she is.

455
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:38,690
Your lovely mum, my lovely wife.

456
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:41,410
- They'll rip the piss out of me!
- Ali, there's no need to swear.

457
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:44,860
- It's disgusting! Disgusting!
- Sweetheart, please. I'm sorry.

458
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:47,730
- Get off me!
- Ali, stop it.

459
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:49,820
Get off me!

460
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:06,930
- What the hell have you done?
- Don't blame me. - You told everyone!

461
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:09,130
She's the one who did
it in the first place!

462
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:11,370
- She? Who the hell's SHE?
- Leave me alone!

463
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:14,780
- That's your mother!
- Ahmed! Shush! Calm down.

464
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:20,580
So where is he now?

465
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:23,690
Egham. They moved there from Winchester.

466
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:27,610
- But you've not been there?
- Not yet.

467
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:29,810
So you are planning to go?

468
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,580
Yes.

469
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:36,700
And what are you planning on
saying when you go to Egham?

470
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:41,820
With his wife there, who probably
never knew anything about it either?

471
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:46,410
I'll wait, till he goes
outside on his own.

472
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:48,860
Right. What, and follow him?

473
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:52,930
OK.

474
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:55,250
And then what, Shoestring?

475
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:59,620
- I'll introduce myself.
- Mm. Mm.

476
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:02,890
So talk me through that.

477
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:08,410
"Hi, I'm Martin. You had sex
with my wife 20 years ago --

478
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:12,050
I just wondered if we could chat."

479
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:16,490
That is probably borderline
illegal, what you're doing, anyway,

480
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:19,650
and I can't imagine for one second
it's going to make you feel better.

481
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:25,770
I mean, he's rich, and
hilarious, and supersmart.

482
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:27,730
Does that make you feel better?

483
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:33,450
Or he's a horrible runty
little goblin with halitosis.

484
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,500
Does that?

485
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:40,490
Or he's ordinary. Like you. Like me.

486
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:44,610
Don't make a joke of
it, please, with Adam.

487
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:47,170
- What do you mean, a joke?
- You do that sometimes.

488
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:48,890
You find everything funny.

489
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:50,940
I absolutely do not.

490
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:56,060
- Hey, guys. - Hi. - Hi.

491
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:04,780
- What happened to your face?
- Oh, it's a, it's a work thing.

492
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:10,770
Granddad, have you been beating Mum again?

493
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:14,570
Not yet, but give it a few days.
She's a cheeky little sod.

494
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:19,970
Right. Beer. And you can
make an old man very happy

495
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:22,820
by telling him about your girlfriend.

496
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:32,050
I have to put my child first, Tess.

497
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:35,660
I know you'll understand that.

498
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:45,450
He'd never hurt Becca. He loves her.

499
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:48,930
I'm not really talking
about physical violence.

500
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:51,620
No... No, no, Paul.

501
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:53,940
She's 15.

502
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:58,330
How can you even begin to...

503
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:02,370
You clearly had no idea what
sort of person your husband was.

504
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:05,420
Why should it be any different with Jason?

505
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:11,340
- Cos I'm his mother.
- And he's his father's son.

506
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:15,930
I'm sorry. I really am.

507
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:19,500
But Becca's my only concern right now.

508
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:23,460
I'll call you.

509
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:28,420
I'll be staying at my sister's for now.

510
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:32,020
I just need a little time to
work out what's best for us all.

511
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:36,780
I do love you.

512
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:11,700
Sara?

513
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:15,460
Sara!

514
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:19,500
Sara, are you there?

515
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:24,770
Can you hear me, Sara?

516
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:26,410
I just want you to know,

517
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:29,370
we're all here for you
if you want to talk.

518
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:31,980
Any of you.

519
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:49,450
Well, yes. There were some rumours,

520
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:54,570
about how Mr Walker was with
some of the kids on the ward.

521
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:57,820
Personally, I never saw
anything, of course.

522
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:00,740
Of course.

523
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:03,580
Yeah. Quinn.

524
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,090
Yeah, that's right.

525
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:09,850
She was released as part of
the Good Friday agreement.

526
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:14,940
We are looking for any kind
of address after December '99.

527
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:18,010
We'll be grateful.

528
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:25,930
It was a kids' charity, and
Walker was a volunteer.

529
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:28,770
Well, we did have suspicions about him,

530
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:31,570
but obviously I didn't
know anything for sure,

531
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:34,180
or I would have reported it.

532
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:36,860
Obviously.

533
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:56,930
How was your mum?

534
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:59,530
Irritating.

535
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:02,450
- Any word from Zoe?
- Yeah. She's texted her parents.

536
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,490
She's fine, but, um,

537
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:06,890
well, she's two days now
without any care, so...

538
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:08,610
What about us?

539
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:14,170
I don't know. That's up to you,
I suppose. If you can forgive me.

540
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:17,700
No, Maz. It isn't up to me.

541
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:21,250
Because ever since I've known you,

542
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:24,580
there's been this great
big wall around you.

543
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:28,720
It's always stopped me
getting past a certain point.

544
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:30,930
And the simple fact is,

545
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:33,940
that if you want us to survive...

546
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:38,290
.. you've got to take it down.

547
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:53,450
- Mr Osborne. Mr Osborne?
Mr Osborne! - Sorry?

548
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,210
Your daughter's school called.

549
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:58,770
You were meant to pick her up an hour ago.

550
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:03,940
Oh! Sorry. Excuse me. Sorry.

551
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:20,860
Hey, you!

552
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:24,690
I'm so, so sorry!

553
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:42,490
Yes, I was at that reform school.

554
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:45,690
Yes, we all knew what David Walker was.

555
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:50,010
But we were kids who'd broken the law.

556
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:53,930
Who was ever going to
believe a word we said?

557
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:57,210
The truth is, a lot of
them didn't mind anyway,

558
00:41:57,260 --> 00:42:04,140
cos if they got friendly with
him, did want he wanted...

559
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:09,620
.. they'd get invited to the gatherings.

560
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:12,460
The gatherings?

561
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:31,530
Sinead Quinn?

562
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:33,330
You're a hard woman to find.

563
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:38,210
DC Fran Lingley. I wonder if you
spare me five minutes of your time?

564
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:40,330
- He just got his days mixed up.
- What I would say is,

565
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:42,210
if you felt a family session could help...

566
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:45,050
.. to talk about time management...

567
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:46,930
Yeah, absolutely. Great idea.

568
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:49,090
Do you need to get that?

569
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:52,090
Yeah, sorry. That's probably him
on his way back home with Flora.

570
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:54,650
'No problem. I'll get you get
off, and tell him not to worry.'

571
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:56,890
- 'We've all been there.'
- Great. Thank you, Janet.

572
00:42:56,940 --> 00:43:00,210
- Speak tomorrow.
- 'OK, great. Bye.'

573
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:03,170
- Hello?
- 'Is that Simon?'

574
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:06,220
- Who's that?
- It's Tyler. How are you doing?

575
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:11,410
- What do you want?
- Straight to the point. I like that.

576
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:14,370
And since you ask, what
we want is 20 grand,

577
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:16,010
or we'll tell social services

578
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:19,100
about your husband being interviewed
in connection with a murder.

579
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:24,130
Our witness, Ellen Harriet Price,

580
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:27,530
told us that a number of
these... gatherings took place

581
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:30,650
between 1981 and 1983.

582
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:32,770
They were held at a house in Brentford,

583
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:37,610
and Walker was a regular, as
were a number of other men,

584
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:39,490
from various walks of life.

585
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:44,050
But most importantly, they were
also regularly attended by children

586
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:47,610
from local care homes, local
Borstals and the streets.

587
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:52,170
Now, these vulnerable kids were
plied with drink, and offered drugs,

588
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:55,900
and then, on a number of
occasions, sexually assaulted.

589
00:43:57,140 --> 00:44:00,490
Now, I think we need to
consider the possibility

590
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:03,890
that one of these people
was taken to this house,

591
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:05,970
assaulted by Walker,

592
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:08,850
and then, eight or nine years later,

593
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:11,450
they've come across him again
and decided to take revenge.

594
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:15,380
The question is, which?

595
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:21,290
The IRA wouldn't have touched
her with a shitty stick.

596
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:24,210
- Right. - She was a
messed-up, middle-class kid

597
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:26,650
wanting to piss off Mummy and Daddy.

598
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:30,770
In fact, her commitment to the cause
was pretty accurately demonstrated

599
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:34,220
when the police knocked on her
door about me a few years later.

600
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:40,580
Did you ever see her with this man?

601
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:47,810
No.

602
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:50,570
But she showed me a photo of him once.

603
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:53,010
Really?

604
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:55,490
- This man? Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

605
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:57,130
In what context?

606
00:44:57,180 --> 00:45:00,130
She said he worked for the Tories,
had connections with Thatcher.

607
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:02,490
She thought he was a potential target.

608
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:04,890
Target?

609
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:08,570
We weren't interested. Too small-time.

610
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:13,170
But aye, she wanted us to kill him.

610
00:45:14,305 --> 00:46:14,915
