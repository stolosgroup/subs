78
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:12,410

<font color="yellow">No.</font>

79
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:14,610
<font color="cyan">Did she hear anything,</font>
<font color="cyan">any shouts from either man?</font>

80
00:04:14,649 --> 00:04:16,010
<font color="yellow">No, but she's quite a way away,</font>

81
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:18,410
<font color="yellow">so there could have been shouts,</font>
<font color="yellow">she just didn't hear them.</font>

82
00:04:18,449 --> 00:04:20,610
<font color="#008000">And she didn't see</font>
<font color="#008000">anyone else get out?</font>

83
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:24,329
<font color="yellow">No, but as this was happening,</font>
<font color="yellow">she turns immediately left here,</font>

84
00:04:24,369 --> 00:04:26,889
<font color="yellow">heading away from the incident</font>
<font color="yellow">and home to her flat.</font>

85
00:04:26,929 --> 00:04:30,569
<font color="#008000">So they could've all got out,</font>
<font color="#008000">she just didn't see that? </font><font color="yellow">Exactly.</font>

86
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:33,689
OK, thank you, Fran,
very good work.

87
00:04:35,249 --> 00:04:38,809
So, our imperative
is obviously to find out

88
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:40,689
exactly what did happen that night.

89
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:42,610
And right now,
I mainly have lots of questions.

90
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:47,809
So, if this was Fogerty's car,
why did it stop?

91
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:51,489
Why did one of them, at least,

92
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:53,730
possibly Ram Sidhu, then get out?

93
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:57,569
What might the connection have been
with Matthew and anyone in the car?

94
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:59,210
Where did Matthew end up,

95
00:04:59,249 --> 00:05:02,210
and ultimately,
where, how, and why did he die?

96
00:05:02,249 --> 00:05:04,929
Was it an accident,
was it manslaughter, was it murder?

97
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:07,689
And whatever it was,
how many people in the car,

98
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:10,850
if any, were involved in his death?

99
00:05:10,889 --> 00:05:13,809
So, Fran, can you speak
to the other two original witnesses

100
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:15,129
as soon as, please?

101
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:20,449
Murray. Matthew's son, Jerome,
just dropped these off for us.

102
00:05:20,489 --> 00:05:23,889
They're from
Matthew's older brother, Clive.

103
00:05:23,929 --> 00:05:25,650
There's return addresses
on some of them.

104
00:05:25,689 --> 00:05:28,290
I'd love to track him down, please.

105
00:05:28,329 --> 00:05:30,770
And, Jake,
locating the rest of the victim

106
00:05:30,809 --> 00:05:34,569
is almost certainly our best chance
of establishing cause of death.

107
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:36,770
I've got the Super doubting
this even is a murder.

108
00:05:36,809 --> 00:05:37,850
I need progress, mate.

your number one priority. <font color="#008000">Guv.</font>

Link in with Professional Standards,

00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:16,410
I came in yesterday with my partner,

122
00:06:16,449 --> 00:06:18,329

124
00:06:21,009 --> 00:06:23,129
Hi. Yeah, I was just wondering,

125
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:24,970
has the money
actually gone through yet?

126
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:27,650
The deposit, has it been drawn down?

127
00:06:27,689 --> 00:06:30,889
<font color="yellow">'Erm... I'm not sure</font>
<font color="yellow">if it's been actioned yet.</font>

<font color="yellow">'I can certainly check for you.'</font>

129
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:35,249
If you could, please.
And if it hasn't, could you stop it?

130
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:38,009
<font color="yellow">'I'm sorry?'</font>

131
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:40,489
I need you to stop the payment,
if you can.

132
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:44,730
Erm...
We have a personal situation here,

133
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:48,050
and, yeah, I need a day or so
to sort it out.

Would you? Thank you. ASAP, please.

137
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:02,369
One other thing -

138
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:04,410
let's get an authority
for mobile phone records.

139
00:07:04,449 --> 00:07:06,610
If they've seen
that Walsh's body's been found,

140
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:09,410
be interesting to know
if any of them have made contact.

141
00:07:09,449 --> 00:07:11,129
<font color="yellow">Yep, OK, no problem.</font>

142
00:07:12,929 --> 00:07:15,650
We're moving house.
You need tomorrow off,

143
00:07:15,689 --> 00:07:18,210
which is why you booked it
six bloody weeks ago.

144
00:07:18,249 --> 00:07:21,850
<font color="yellow">I know, I know. It's just that</font>
<font color="yellow">we're so short-handed right now.</font>

145
00:07:21,889 --> 00:07:24,410
<font color="yellow">But, listen,</font>
<font color="yellow">I'll call the removals company</font>

146
00:07:24,449 --> 00:07:26,129
<font color="yellow">and get them</font>
<font color="yellow">to put an extra guy on it.</font>

147
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:27,730
<font color="yellow">'I'll try to get off by four.'</font>

148
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:29,610
Four? Marvellous (!)

149
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:32,530
<font color="yellow">Yeah, welcome to my world.</font>
<font color="yellow">Look, I've gotta go.</font>

150
00:07:32,569 --> 00:07:34,850
<font color="yellow">'I'll call you later.</font>
<font color="yellow">Sorry again. I love you.'</font>

151
00:07:36,449 --> 00:07:39,290
Oh, that is brilliant news,
thank you.

152
00:07:39,329 --> 00:07:41,970
I can't tell you how much
we appreciate it.

153
00:07:42,009 --> 00:07:44,770
Yeah. Well, we look forward
to seeing you, too.

154
00:07:44,809 --> 00:07:48,249
Tell them to bring their wallets!
SHE CHUCKLES

155
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:50,530
Thank you. Thanks. Bye.

156
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:57,809
I have just sold the last table
to Terry Fuller, full whack,

157
00:07:57,850 --> 00:07:59,569
and he's bringing
a load of his brokers.

158
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:03,809
<font color="yellow">That is brilliant news, love.</font>
<font color="yellow">Well done.</font>

159
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:06,009
<font color="yellow">Did you hear that? </font><font color="cyan">No.</font>
<font color="yellow">There's gonna be everybody.</font>

160
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:09,009
<font color="yellow">Do you want to help me with this?</font>
<font color="cyan">Yes. </font><font color="yellow">Well, come on, then.</font>

161
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:10,770
<font color="yellow">Gonna straighten it up.</font>
<font color="cyan">Yeah.</font>

162
00:08:10,809 --> 00:08:13,090
Fiona, it's Mark.

163
00:08:13,129 --> 00:08:15,489
I've had a call from your solicitor,
slightly freaked out.

164
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:17,850
I mean,
please tell me she misunderstood,

165
00:08:17,889 --> 00:08:20,129
but she said you wanted
to withhold your deposit.

166
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:22,730
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>
'What the fuck? Why?'

167
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:26,210
<font color="yellow">Has it been paid?</font>

168
00:08:26,249 --> 00:08:29,170
Yeah, it went out last night.
What's going on? Is there a problem?

169
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:30,610
<font color="yellow">OK, erm...</font>

170
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:35,969
<font color="yellow">..do not tell your brother this,</font>
<font color="yellow">but can I come and see you?</font>

171
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:38,449
'Fiona...'
<font color="yellow">Please, Mark.</font>

172
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:43,569
I'm in meetings until six.
Can it wait till then?

173
00:08:43,609 --> 00:08:44,689
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

174
00:08:44,729 --> 00:08:46,890
Actually, my last appointment's
nearer my flat.

175
00:08:46,929 --> 00:08:49,729
Can you meet me there at 6:30?

176
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:52,650
<font color="yellow">I'll see you then. OK.</font>

177
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,729
Lucy?

178
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:15,209
<font color="yellow">You can do one.</font>
I've got a proposition for you.

179
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,969
<font color="yellow">Piss off!</font>
A financial proposition.

180
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:27,010
<font color="yellow">Elizabeth?</font>

181
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:32,849
Yeah, sorry, Eugenia, I haven't
had time to think about your money.

182
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:35,689
<font color="yellow">Right, it's just....</font>
My mother has asked,

183
00:09:35,729 --> 00:09:38,250
could you not bring your daughter
to work with you?

184
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:41,130
She says she makes
quite a lot of noise.

185
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:43,010
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, it's an inset day,</font>

186
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:46,370
<font color="yellow">and the childcare is very expensive,</font>
<font color="yellow">which is why I really need...</font>

187
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:47,849
Please, Eugenia.

188
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:53,010
It's not a brilliant time,
as you can probably see.

189
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:55,609
I will come back to you
in a day or so.

190
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:00,209
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

191
00:10:02,569 --> 00:10:03,770
Thank you.

192
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,089
CAR DOOR SHUTS

193
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:34,575
So, as I said briefly
at the door, ma'am...

194
00:10:34,614 --> 00:10:36,374
<font color="yellow">Liz, please.</font>

195
00:10:37,614 --> 00:10:40,175
Liz, thank you.
As I said at the door,

196
00:10:40,215 --> 00:10:42,894
we're investigating what we believe
to be an historic murder.

197
00:10:42,935 --> 00:10:44,254
<font color="yellow">You believe?</font>

198
00:10:44,295 --> 00:10:46,975
We're waiting for cause of death
to be completely confirmed.

199
00:10:47,014 --> 00:10:48,095
<font color="yellow">OK.</font>

200
00:10:48,134 --> 00:10:51,975
But we think... we hope
you might be able to help

201
00:10:52,014 --> 00:10:54,774
throw some light on the events
of an evening

202
00:10:54,815 --> 00:10:57,534
connected to the victim's death,
30 years ago.

203
00:10:57,575 --> 00:10:59,055
<font color="yellow">Oh, wow.</font>
Yeah, I know.

204
00:10:59,095 --> 00:11:01,975
I can hardly remember
what I had for breakfast.

205
00:11:02,014 --> 00:11:05,095
But let's see how we get on,
shall we? <font color="yellow">Fire away.</font>

206
00:11:06,494 --> 00:11:09,614
So, a few days ago, we found a body.

207
00:11:09,654 --> 00:11:13,175
We've identified the victim
as a Matthew Kieran Walsh,

208
00:11:13,215 --> 00:11:16,374
who actually went missing in 1990.

209
00:11:16,415 --> 00:11:19,695
His body was completely preserved
when we found it,

210
00:11:19,734 --> 00:11:22,254
and we've subsequently found
evidence to confirm

211
00:11:22,295 --> 00:11:25,254
that he'd been kept in a freezer
for the last three decades.

212
00:11:25,295 --> 00:11:27,695
<font color="yellow">I think I saw this on the news</font>
<font color="yellow">last night.</font>

213
00:11:27,734 --> 00:11:29,695
Yes, you will have done.

214
00:11:31,134 --> 00:11:34,215
So, this is him.

215
00:11:37,374 --> 00:11:38,654
<font color="yellow">OK.</font>

216
00:11:40,894 --> 00:11:42,055
Face doesn't ring any bells?

217
00:11:42,095 --> 00:11:44,734
<font color="yellow">Other than last night, no.</font>
<font color="yellow">Should it?</font>

218
00:11:44,774 --> 00:11:48,415
No, no, that's fine.
Thank you for that.

219
00:11:49,654 --> 00:11:52,095
So, then, we connected the victim

220
00:11:52,134 --> 00:11:55,095
to the house of a man
called Robert Fogerty.

221
00:11:56,215 --> 00:12:00,815
And we believe it was him
who stored the body all those years,

222
00:12:00,854 --> 00:12:03,374
and I wondered
if his face was at all familiar?

223
00:12:03,415 --> 00:12:05,095
<font color="yellow">Nope, sorry.</font>

224
00:12:09,455 --> 00:12:13,415
So, Mr Fogerty is himself now dead,

225
00:12:13,455 --> 00:12:15,695
but we have fairly good reason
to believe

226
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:20,894
that at some point on the night
of the 30th March 1990,

227
00:12:20,935 --> 00:12:24,774
Mr Fogerty had Matthew Walsh's body
in the boot of his car.

228
00:12:26,215 --> 00:12:28,014
<font color="yellow">Oh, right.</font>

229
00:12:28,055 --> 00:12:31,534
And the reason I ask
if his face was at all familiar

230
00:12:31,575 --> 00:12:36,455
is that Mr Fogerty
was actually a police probationer,

231
00:12:36,494 --> 00:12:39,455
and, we believe,
trained with you at Hendon.

232
00:12:39,494 --> 00:12:42,614
<font color="yellow">A probationer?</font>
And trained with you.

233
00:12:42,654 --> 00:12:45,415
So would you mind
having another look?

234
00:12:48,815 --> 00:12:51,575
<font color="yellow">No, I'm so sorry,</font>
<font color="yellow">I don't remember him.</font>

235
00:12:51,614 --> 00:12:53,014
Not a problem.

236
00:12:55,055 --> 00:12:59,614
So that then just leaves
the actual car journey

237
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:02,534
that Mr Fogerty made that evening.
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>

238
00:13:02,575 --> 00:13:05,415
Which is mainly what I wanted to try
to get some further details on,

239
00:13:05,455 --> 00:13:08,854
because we do also have
good evidence, Liz,

240
00:13:08,894 --> 00:13:14,055
to suggest that Fogerty
wasn't alone that night in his car,

241
00:13:14,095 --> 00:13:18,014
that he had four other probationers
from Hendon with him,

242
00:13:18,055 --> 00:13:20,175
and one of them...

243
00:13:21,774 --> 00:13:23,295
..was you.

244
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:26,254
<font color="yellow">Whoa.</font>

245
00:13:31,374 --> 00:13:32,815
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

246
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:37,374
<font color="yellow">I thought I was being interviewed</font>
<font color="yellow">as a possible witness.</font>

247
00:13:40,494 --> 00:13:41,894
<font color="yellow">I mean, this sounds like....</font>

248
00:13:43,734 --> 00:13:45,254
<font color="yellow">Am I a suspect here?</font>

249
00:13:45,295 --> 00:13:46,415
Absolutely not.

250
00:13:46,455 --> 00:13:50,254
As I say, we're just trying
to establish a chain of events.

251
00:13:50,295 --> 00:13:53,335
And if you'd prefer, I can send it
through to Professional Standards

252
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:55,815
to interview you more formally...

253
00:13:55,854 --> 00:13:58,575
at a station, under caution.

254
00:13:58,614 --> 00:14:00,134
I'm very happy to do that.

255
00:14:00,175 --> 00:14:03,854
I just assumed
that might be difficult for you.

256
00:14:05,534 --> 00:14:07,654
But it's your call entirely.

257
00:14:16,095 --> 00:14:19,295
Yeah, I do vaguely remember him.

258
00:14:19,335 --> 00:14:20,575
<font color="yellow">OK.</font>

259
00:14:20,614 --> 00:14:23,575
<font color="yellow">So, he was a friend or...?</font>
No, I just remember him.

260
00:14:23,614 --> 00:14:27,095
<font color="yellow">OK, so a face you recall</font>
<font color="yellow">from the course?</font>

261
00:14:27,134 --> 00:14:28,654
Yeah.

262
00:14:28,695 --> 00:14:31,654
<font color="yellow">And... Thank you.</font>

263
00:14:31,695 --> 00:14:33,695
<font color="yellow">Was it a close-knit bunch,</font>
<font color="yellow">would you say?</font>

264
00:14:33,734 --> 00:14:35,854
Why would you ask that?

265
00:14:35,894 --> 00:14:39,055
<font color="yellow">Have you kept in touch</font>
<font color="yellow">with any of them since?</font>

266
00:14:39,095 --> 00:14:41,935
I'm presuming you know I didn't stay
with the police very long?

267
00:14:41,975 --> 00:14:43,095
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

268
00:14:43,134 --> 00:14:45,335
Then, why would you ask that?

269
00:14:45,374 --> 00:14:47,894
Unless, of course, you're trying
to catch me out or something?

270
00:14:47,935 --> 00:14:49,455
<font color="yellow">Sorry, I'm absolutely not trying...</font>

271
00:14:49,494 --> 00:14:51,695
No, it wasn't a close-knit bunch.
Not for me, anyway.

272
00:14:51,734 --> 00:14:53,894
And no, I haven't kept in touch
with any of them.

273
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:55,654
<font color="yellow">OK.</font>

274
00:14:55,695 --> 00:14:58,014
<font color="yellow">So, notwithstanding that,</font>

275
00:14:58,055 --> 00:14:59,975
<font color="yellow">can I just run</font>
<font color="yellow">a few other names past you?</font>

276
00:15:00,014 --> 00:15:01,734
What's this got to do
with your murder?

277
00:15:01,774 --> 00:15:03,575
<font color="yellow">It's just three names,</font>
<font color="yellow">take ten seconds.</font>

278
00:15:04,734 --> 00:15:05,975
Fine.

279
00:15:06,014 --> 00:15:08,295
<font color="yellow">Dean Barton?</font>
No.

280
00:15:08,335 --> 00:15:09,854
<font color="yellow">Ram Sidhu.</font>

281
00:15:09,894 --> 00:15:12,175
Er...

282
00:15:12,215 --> 00:15:15,935
Vaguely.
There was a Sikh lad, I think.

283
00:15:15,975 --> 00:15:18,254
<font color="yellow">Mm-hm. And Liz Baildon?</font>

284
00:15:18,295 --> 00:15:20,935
No.
<font color="yellow">Well, there you go.</font>

285
00:15:20,975 --> 00:15:24,014
<font color="yellow">Two out of four obviously made a</font>
<font color="yellow">greater impression than you thought.</font>

286
00:15:24,055 --> 00:15:26,695
<font color="yellow">Erm... So, Fiona,</font>
<font color="yellow">I'd like to, if I may,</font>

287
00:15:26,734 --> 00:15:29,854
<font color="yellow">to try and take you back to</font>
<font color="yellow">the night of your passing out party.</font>

288
00:15:32,614 --> 00:15:35,134
<font color="yellow">Well, obviously, I remember Ram.</font>

289
00:15:35,175 --> 00:15:37,295
<font color="yellow">I remember training with him,</font>

290
00:15:37,335 --> 00:15:39,494
<font color="yellow">and I know</font>
<font color="yellow">he's done good work since,</font>

291
00:15:39,534 --> 00:15:41,975
<font color="yellow">in Vice, I believe.</font>

292
00:15:42,014 --> 00:15:44,935
<font color="yellow">But I have no recollection</font>
<font color="yellow">of any car journey with him</font>

293
00:15:44,975 --> 00:15:46,815
<font color="yellow">or any of those other names.</font>

294
00:15:48,175 --> 00:15:52,175
<font color="yellow">I'm not saying it didn't happen,</font>
<font color="yellow">I just don't remember that,</font>

295
00:15:52,215 --> 00:15:55,175
<font color="yellow">30 years later.</font>
Hmm.

296
00:15:55,215 --> 00:15:57,575
Not even when Mr Fogerty
got pulled over

297
00:15:57,614 --> 00:15:59,734
and arrested for drink-driving?

298
00:15:59,774 --> 00:16:03,815
<font color="yellow">Drink-driving?</font>
Breathalysed and arrested.

299
00:16:03,854 --> 00:16:06,774
Lost his entire career on the
evening of the same day it started.

300
00:16:06,815 --> 00:16:09,774
I would've thought
that might have stuck in your mind.

301
00:16:09,815 --> 00:16:13,095
<font color="yellow">Oh, OK, now you mention that...</font>

302
00:16:14,415 --> 00:16:15,575
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

303
00:16:16,975 --> 00:16:19,095
<font color="yellow">Sorry, I do remember now.</font>

304
00:16:19,134 --> 00:16:21,975
Oh, OK, well, that's excellent.

305
00:16:23,014 --> 00:16:25,815
<font color="yellow">Apologies. Until you said</font>
<font color="yellow">the breath test thing,</font>

306
00:16:25,854 --> 00:16:27,614
<font color="yellow">I had no memory of it at all.</font>

307
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:30,654
Not a problem,
it was a long time ago.

308
00:16:30,695 --> 00:16:33,534
<font color="yellow">Were we coming back from</font>
<font color="yellow">the actual passing out party?</font>

309
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:35,534
We think so, yes.

310
00:16:35,575 --> 00:16:37,695
<font color="yellow">I'm getting there now.</font>

311
00:16:37,734 --> 00:16:41,134
<font color="yellow">I think it was actually me</font>
<font color="yellow">that drove Rob's car back</font>

312
00:16:41,175 --> 00:16:42,614
<font color="yellow">after he was nicked.</font>

313
00:16:42,654 --> 00:16:48,894
It was. The traffic officer made
a note of your request to do that.

314
00:16:48,935 --> 00:16:50,695
That's well remembered.

315
00:16:50,734 --> 00:16:53,975
<font color="yellow">Yes, cos I was fully comp,</font>
<font color="yellow">I lived near Rob,</font>

316
00:16:54,014 --> 00:16:55,695
<font color="yellow">so I dropped the others off,</font>

317
00:16:55,734 --> 00:16:58,095
<font color="yellow">and then I dropped his car</font>
<font color="yellow">back at his place.</font>

318
00:16:59,415 --> 00:17:02,254
<font color="yellow">I walked home.</font>
Oh, OK.

319
00:17:04,415 --> 00:17:06,534
Anything else coming back?

320
00:17:06,574 --> 00:17:07,975
<font color="yellow">No, I don't think so.</font>

321
00:17:08,014 --> 00:17:10,895
Nothing about the mood
of anyone in the car? <font color="yellow">No.</font>

322
00:17:10,935 --> 00:17:13,094
No recollection of the car
stopping at any point

323
00:17:13,135 --> 00:17:14,334
before it was pulled over?

324
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:17,935
<font color="yellow">No. </font>No recollection of anyone
getting out at any other point?

325
00:17:17,975 --> 00:17:19,774
<font color="yellow">No recollection of anyone</font>
<font color="yellow">getting out</font>

326
00:17:19,814 --> 00:17:22,655
<font color="yellow">and loading a dead body in the boot,</font>
<font color="yellow">if that's what you mean.</font>

327
00:17:23,695 --> 00:17:25,415
<font color="yellow">I think that would have stuck.</font>

328
00:17:27,094 --> 00:17:29,734
Yeah, I'm sure.
SHE CHUCKLES

329
00:17:29,774 --> 00:17:32,814
OK, well, yeah, I think that's it.

330
00:17:34,534 --> 00:17:37,094
That's been really useful.

331
00:17:37,135 --> 00:17:38,935
Thank you so much for that.

332
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:43,094
<font color="yellow">You're good.</font>
Sorry?

333
00:17:43,135 --> 00:17:46,014
<font color="yellow">Nothing. I'll show you out.</font>

334
00:18:09,574 --> 00:18:11,695
Can I hoover in here now?

335
00:18:12,655 --> 00:18:13,734
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

336
00:18:13,774 --> 00:18:16,855
THUMPING

337
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:18,534
<font color="yellow">And see what she wants.</font>

338
00:18:23,975 --> 00:18:27,054
I think we talk Friday
about my money.

339
00:18:32,855 --> 00:18:35,334
I'm sorry, I don't remember
any of what you describe.

340
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:38,135
<font color="yellow">Quite an unusual night,</font>
<font color="yellow">wouldn't you say?</font>

341
00:18:38,175 --> 00:18:40,294
<font color="yellow">Quite... memorable?</font>

342
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:43,494
Under normal circumstances, yes.

343
00:18:43,534 --> 00:18:44,655
<font color="yellow">How do you mean?</font>

344
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:52,655
My father was a police officer.

345
00:18:53,695 --> 00:18:55,215
His father, too.

346
00:18:56,294 --> 00:19:00,895
And Dad always said the day
I qualified...

347
00:19:01,935 --> 00:19:03,935
..was the happiest day of his life.

348
00:19:06,215 --> 00:19:09,014
The only problem was
I absolutely hated it.

349
00:19:10,294 --> 00:19:13,574
Erm... It wasn't a surprise.
I always knew I'd hate it.

350
00:19:13,615 --> 00:19:15,814
I always knew
I wasn't copper material.

351
00:19:15,855 --> 00:19:17,975
But I adored my father, so...

352
00:19:19,574 --> 00:19:22,375
Anyway, er...

353
00:19:22,415 --> 00:19:26,455
long before I got the letter
confirming my application...

354
00:19:28,175 --> 00:19:29,415
..I began to drink.

355
00:19:29,455 --> 00:19:31,655
And then, when I started
the actual training,

356
00:19:31,695 --> 00:19:33,814
I began to drink more.

357
00:19:33,855 --> 00:19:36,334
In fact, I was astonished
they didn't kick me out.

358
00:19:37,975 --> 00:19:42,175
Erm... So, that day,
the day of the ceremony...

359
00:19:43,574 --> 00:19:49,574
..as soon as all the guests
had left, I just... went for it.

360
00:19:49,615 --> 00:19:52,215
Pouring anything I could find
down my throat

361
00:19:52,254 --> 00:19:53,895
to bury the unhappiness.

362
00:19:55,094 --> 00:19:57,734
And I didn't stop
for about three more years.

363
00:19:57,774 --> 00:20:03,695
So I remember nothing
about that night.

364
00:20:03,734 --> 00:20:06,455
And not much about
the next few years, to be honest.

365
00:20:07,855 --> 00:20:11,014
My father died in summer '91,
after a long illness,

366
00:20:11,054 --> 00:20:14,334
and... I was able to leave

367
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:16,175
without feeling
that I'd let him down.

368
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,615
And it was only then
that I began to get better.

369
00:20:20,294 --> 00:20:25,415
So, yes, of course I should be able
to remember what you describe.

370
00:20:28,455 --> 00:20:30,695
But I'm sorry, I don't.

371
00:20:33,215 --> 00:20:35,215
<font color="yellow">OK.</font>

372
00:20:35,254 --> 00:20:39,695
<font color="yellow">I'd like to show you a photo</font>
<font color="yellow">of the victim, Matthew Walsh.</font>

373
00:20:50,215 --> 00:20:54,375
No, nothing, sorry.

374
00:20:57,494 --> 00:20:59,014
<font color="yellow">No problem, thanks for your time.</font>

375
00:21:05,935 --> 00:21:07,814
Don't worry about knocking (!)

376
00:21:07,855 --> 00:21:10,734
<font color="yellow">So, we are not having</font>
<font color="yellow">this conversation.</font>

377
00:21:10,774 --> 00:21:12,774
<font color="yellow">And we're not having it because,</font>
<font color="yellow">as ever,</font>

378
00:21:12,814 --> 00:21:14,975
<font color="yellow">when I'm accused of something</font>
<font color="yellow">I didn't do,</font>

379
00:21:15,014 --> 00:21:17,534
<font color="yellow">when I am not given the same benefit</font>
<font color="yellow">of the doubt as a white</font>

380
00:21:17,574 --> 00:21:21,415
<font color="yellow">and maybe less fucking irritating</font>
<font color="yellow">officer would be,</font>

381
00:21:21,455 --> 00:21:24,175
<font color="yellow">I have to employ unconventional</font>
<font color="yellow">methods to reveal the truth.</font>

382
00:21:24,215 --> 00:21:28,094
<font color="yellow">Our temp, Lucy Myers,</font>
<font color="yellow">is also, it turns out,</font>

383
00:21:28,135 --> 00:21:31,094
<font color="yellow">the cousin of a scabby little prick</font>
<font color="yellow">called Tommy Munroe.</font>

384
00:21:31,135 --> 00:21:33,014
<font color="yellow">A fully paid up member of the EDF,</font>

385
00:21:33,054 --> 00:21:36,494
<font color="yellow">who I had the very good fortune</font>
<font color="yellow">of sending down last year</font>

386
00:21:36,534 --> 00:21:38,774
<font color="yellow">for importing 20 keys</font>
<font color="yellow">of Colombian flake.</font>

387
00:21:38,814 --> 00:21:42,734
<font color="yellow">Now, I think it's be fair to say</font>
<font color="yellow">me and him didn't really hit it off,</font>

388
00:21:42,774 --> 00:21:46,574
<font color="yellow">but if what his cousin said to me</font>
<font color="yellow">this morning is any clue,</font>

389
00:21:46,615 --> 00:21:50,855
<font color="yellow">I think Juicy Lucy shares</font>
<font color="yellow">a few of his political inclinations.</font>

390
00:21:52,334 --> 00:21:54,975
<font color="cyan">'50 measly quid?</font>
<font color="cyan">You fucking Paki slag.</font>

391
00:21:55,014 --> 00:21:58,135
<font color="cyan">'Get out of my house, or I'll get</font>
<font color="cyan">my brothers round here and...'</font>

392
00:22:03,334 --> 00:22:04,655
'Hello?'

393
00:22:04,695 --> 00:22:06,455
<font color="yellow">Hey, love, it's me.</font>

394
00:22:06,494 --> 00:22:07,935
<font color="yellow">'I'm on my way home,</font>

395
00:22:07,975 --> 00:22:10,294
<font color="yellow">'and I wanted to say I'm so sorry</font>
<font color="yellow">I've not been around.</font>

396
00:22:10,334 --> 00:22:12,574
<font color="yellow">'I had a serious work issue,</font>
<font color="yellow">but it's resolved now.'</font>

397
00:22:12,615 --> 00:22:14,375
<font color="yellow">So can we talk?</font>

398
00:22:17,215 --> 00:22:19,135
Yeah, course.

399
00:22:20,855 --> 00:22:22,975
<font color="yellow">Yeah, a bit flaky and weird.</font>

400
00:22:23,014 --> 00:22:25,655
<font color="yellow">I mean, she's never told her partner</font>
<font color="yellow">she'd been a copper.</font>

401
00:22:25,695 --> 00:22:26,895
'Serious?'

402
00:22:26,935 --> 00:22:28,655
<font color="yellow">But I keep coming back to the fact</font>

403
00:22:28,695 --> 00:22:30,455
<font color="yellow">that we don't have</font>
<font color="yellow">any real connection yet</font>

404
00:22:30,494 --> 00:22:32,615
<font color="yellow">between Walsh and the other four.</font>

405
00:22:32,655 --> 00:22:34,455
At the moment.

406
00:22:34,494 --> 00:22:36,415
<font color="yellow">'Obviously,</font>
<font color="yellow">there's another two to speak to,</font>

407
00:22:36,455 --> 00:22:38,774
<font color="yellow">'but we don't even know</font>
<font color="yellow">if Walsh was killed that night,</font>

408
00:22:38,814 --> 00:22:40,494
<font color="yellow">'just he wasn't seen again.'</font>

409
00:22:40,534 --> 00:22:43,455
You think he could have died
after the last sighting?

410
00:22:43,494 --> 00:22:45,655
<font color="yellow">My point is we that don't know.</font>

411
00:22:45,695 --> 00:22:47,855
<font color="yellow">I mean, all we've got</font>
<font color="yellow">that's specific to that night</font>

412
00:22:47,895 --> 00:22:50,855
<font color="yellow">is a sighting of a car,</font>
<font color="yellow">possibly Fogerty's,</font>

413
00:22:50,895 --> 00:22:52,814
<font color="yellow">and a man, possibly Sidhu,</font>
<font color="yellow">getting out</font>

414
00:22:52,855 --> 00:22:55,655
<font color="yellow">and heading in the same direction</font>
<font color="yellow">as another man, possibly Walsh.</font>

415
00:22:55,695 --> 00:22:57,655
<font color="yellow">'Was it a chase? Maybe.</font>

416
00:22:57,695 --> 00:22:59,895
<font color="yellow">'I just want to be sure,</font>
<font color="yellow">given everything you've said,</font>

417
00:22:59,935 --> 00:23:01,895
<font color="yellow">'that we're not heading down</font>
<font color="yellow">a rabbit hole.'</font>

418
00:23:01,935 --> 00:23:04,094
Mmm.
PHONE CHIRPS

419
00:23:04,135 --> 00:23:05,814
I've got Jake calling.

420
00:23:05,855 --> 00:23:08,014
Let's talk after
we've interviewed the other two.

421
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:09,215
<font color="yellow">'Cool.'</font>

422
00:23:09,254 --> 00:23:11,254
Night, Sunny.
<font color="yellow">'Night, boss.'</font>

423
00:23:12,254 --> 00:23:13,574
Hey, Jake, what's up?

424
00:23:13,615 --> 00:23:16,494
<font color="cyan">'So, we were able to eliminate</font>
<font color="cyan">the writing on six of the fobs.'</font>

425
00:23:16,534 --> 00:23:20,734
<font color="cyan">We had garden gate, spare room,</font>
<font color="cyan">two padlocks, cellar,</font>

426
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:23,094
<font color="cyan">and then one that just said "SSS".</font>

427
00:23:23,135 --> 00:23:25,615
<font color="cyan">'Now, on the off chance,</font>
<font color="cyan">I googled storage facilities</font>

428
00:23:25,655 --> 00:23:28,415
<font color="cyan">'in a five-mile radius</font>
<font color="cyan">of Fogerty's house, and guess what?'</font>

429
00:23:28,455 --> 00:23:32,695
<font color="cyan">Less than half a mile away is</font>
<font color="cyan">a facility called Stow Safe & Sound.</font>

430
00:23:32,734 --> 00:23:35,135
Have you called them?
<font color="cyan">'Shut for the night now.'</font>

431
00:23:35,175 --> 00:23:38,494
<font color="cyan">But we've got to be in with</font>
<font color="cyan">a shout there, haven't we, boss?</font>

432
00:23:40,329 --> 00:23:41,569
I've fucked up.

433
00:23:41,609 --> 00:23:43,369
<font color="yellow">Yeah, I guessed that much.</font>

434
00:23:43,409 --> 00:23:48,649
So, I'm worried about
something in my past

435
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:51,250
that the mortgage company
could find out about,

436
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:54,050
which I'm scared could make them
decide to withdraw their money,

437
00:23:54,089 --> 00:23:56,889
so we couldn't complete,
and we'd lose our deposit.

438
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:59,409
<font color="yellow">What thing in your past?</font>
I'll tell you that in a minute.

439
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:03,649
But first, I wanted to know
if there's a way

440
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:05,690
you could change my name
on the mortgage forms?

441
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:07,050
<font color="yellow">Change your name?</font>

442
00:24:07,089 --> 00:24:09,369
Use Geoff's surname,
make me Fiona Tomlinson,

443
00:24:09,409 --> 00:24:11,290
as if we were married.

444
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:18,129
<font color="yellow">So this thing in your past</font>
<font color="yellow">can't be linked by them to you now?</font>

445
00:24:18,169 --> 00:24:19,450
Yeah.

446
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:21,649
<font color="yellow">OK.</font>

447
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:26,409
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

448
00:24:30,849 --> 00:24:33,010
<font color="yellow">..firstly, almost certainly, no.</font>

449
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:36,329
<font color="yellow">And even if I could,</font>
<font color="yellow">to be honest with you, I wouldn't.</font>

450
00:24:36,369 --> 00:24:38,250
<font color="yellow">But more importantly than that,</font>

451
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:41,609
<font color="yellow">the mortgage company aren't gonna</font>
<font color="yellow">withdraw their loan, Fiona.</font>

452
00:24:41,649 --> 00:24:42,930
<font color="yellow">They've already approved it,</font>

453
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:45,290
<font color="yellow">they've already done</font>
<font color="yellow">their credit and legal checks.</font>

454
00:24:45,329 --> 00:24:48,329
I read they can actually still
withdraw the funds after exchange,

455
00:24:48,369 --> 00:24:50,129
if they receive new information.

456
00:24:50,169 --> 00:24:51,490
<font color="yellow">OK.</font>

457
00:24:54,129 --> 00:24:56,409
<font color="yellow">What is it we're talking about?</font>

458
00:24:57,849 --> 00:25:00,010
I have a criminal conviction.
<font color="yellow">The fuck?</font>

459
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:01,050
I know.
<font color="yellow">For what?</font>

460
00:25:01,089 --> 00:25:03,889
I'd prefer not to say.
<font color="yellow">Fiona...</font>

461
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:06,210
It's from years ago
and I'm pretty sure it's spent.

462
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:09,010
It's just... I woke up
in a total panic last night

463
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:11,290
that they might do
another credit check or something.

464
00:25:11,329 --> 00:25:14,730
<font color="yellow">And you didn't think maybe</font>
<font color="yellow">to discuss this with me or Geoff</font>

465
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:16,930
<font color="yellow">before you paid a 50K deposit?</font>
I know.

466
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:18,770
<font color="yellow">Fiona, you need to tell me</font>
<font color="yellow">what this is.</font>

467
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:21,210
I can't, I'm sorry.

468
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:23,930
<font color="yellow">Well, all the checks</font>
<font color="yellow">that would be done</font>

469
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:26,089
<font color="yellow">have already been done, so...</font>

470
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:29,930
<font color="yellow">Unless this is something in the,</font>
<font color="yellow">I dunno, public domain,</font>

471
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:32,210
<font color="yellow">that they would find out about</font>
<font color="yellow">in the next two weeks?</font>

472
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:37,089
And what sort of criminal conviction
would they withdraw an offer for?

473
00:25:37,129 --> 00:25:38,930
<font color="yellow">Anything money-related, obviously.</font>

474
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:41,169
<font color="yellow">Please, please tell me</font>
<font color="yellow">it wasn't fraud.</font>

475
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:44,530
It wasn't, I swear.
<font color="yellow">OK, progress.</font>

476
00:25:44,569 --> 00:25:46,970
So?
<font color="yellow">So what?</font>

477
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:49,409
Can you help me change the name?

478
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:52,970
<font color="yellow">You are gonna refuse to tell me</font>
<font color="yellow">what the conviction was for?</font>

479
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:55,569
I can't, Mark. <font color="yellow">And I presume</font>
<font color="yellow">my brother's got no idea about this?</font>

480
00:25:55,609 --> 00:25:56,809
No.

481
00:25:59,169 --> 00:26:00,809
<font color="yellow">OK.</font>

482
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:06,730
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

483
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:13,010
<font color="yellow">..even if I could do it -</font>
<font color="yellow">and as I say,</font>

484
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:14,889
<font color="yellow">I've no idea if it's even possible -</font>

485
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:17,809
<font color="yellow">but if it was and I did,</font>
<font color="yellow">I'd be putting myself</font>

486
00:26:17,849 --> 00:26:20,569
<font color="yellow">in an incredibly compromising</font>
<font color="yellow">position, Fiona. </font>I know.

487
00:26:20,609 --> 00:26:22,369
<font color="yellow">I could lose my licence</font>
<font color="yellow">if anyone found out.</font>

488
00:26:22,409 --> 00:26:26,329
I know, and I'm so sorry to ask.
It's just...

489
00:26:26,369 --> 00:26:29,649
if we lost that money,
it could ruin us.

490
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:33,569
We'd have to sell the house.
It would be a total disaster for us.

491
00:26:33,609 --> 00:26:35,250
For the kids.

492
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:38,569
It'd just be awful.

493
00:26:42,369 --> 00:26:44,530
<font color="yellow">And what would you do for me</font>
<font color="yellow">in return?</font>

494
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:50,809
CHATTER, MELLOW JAZZ

495
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:00,450
BAND FINISH PLAYING

496
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:02,970
Evening, everybody.

497
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:06,210
So, we've got a fun-filled evening
lined up for you.

498
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,770
We've got the auction coming up,

499
00:27:07,809 --> 00:27:10,569
and we've got the band playing
till midnight,

500
00:27:10,609 --> 00:27:14,889
and I've got a very busy evening
trying to get round the room

501
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:17,129
to relieve you
of your hard-earned dough.

502
00:27:17,169 --> 00:27:18,809
LAUGHTER

503
00:27:18,849 --> 00:27:21,609
But, before all of that,

504
00:27:21,649 --> 00:27:23,809
I just wanted to say
a few quick thank-yous.

505
00:27:23,849 --> 00:27:27,530
Firstly, thank you all
for coming tonight

506
00:27:27,569 --> 00:27:30,809
and paying a frankly exorbitant
amount of money for a table.

507
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:32,569
LAUGHTER

508
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:37,490
Secondly, I want to say
a huge thank you

509
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:39,409
to all the staff here.

510
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:42,609
What a brilliant job they do,
day in, day out, for our children.

511
00:27:42,649 --> 00:27:44,089
APPLAUSE

512
00:27:44,129 --> 00:27:47,530
And lastly, and most importantly,

513
00:27:47,569 --> 00:27:50,770
I wanna say thank you
to my son, Jack...

514
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:55,369
..who has...

515
00:27:57,809 --> 00:28:00,930
..enriched my life in so many ways.

516
00:28:02,129 --> 00:28:05,809
He's taught me that
I'm not the centre of the universe.

517
00:28:05,849 --> 00:28:08,889
Who knew?
LIGHT LAUGHTER

518
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:15,290
He has taught me to look for joy
in the most unexpected places.

519
00:28:15,329 --> 00:28:19,290
And he has...

520
00:28:19,329 --> 00:28:21,329
allowed me to find...

521
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:26,690
..an ease with the world

522
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:29,530
that I never thought possible.

523
00:28:31,089 --> 00:28:35,609
And that is the most unexpected,
extraordinary gift from him.

524
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:39,169
So, to Jack,

525
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:42,609
and to all our children,
we celebrate you.

526
00:28:42,649 --> 00:28:46,490
And to the rest of you,
we are coming for your wallets!

527
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:48,450
APPLAUSE

528
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:01,569
What do you know about it?

529
00:29:01,609 --> 00:29:04,450
<font color="yellow">About the same as most people,</font>
<font color="yellow">I guess.</font>

530
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:07,169
You haven't gone online
and researched the fuck out of it?

531
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:10,089
<font color="yellow">No, I knew you'd take care of that.</font>

532
00:29:10,129 --> 00:29:11,569
Fair enough.

533
00:29:12,809 --> 00:29:14,970
OK, so here's what
I found out, then.

534
00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:19,050
I found out that, actually, a kid
with Down's is not so different.

535
00:29:20,369 --> 00:29:22,649
There might be some
physical health things,

536
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:26,649
they might take a little longer
to do certain things,

537
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:28,849
there might be a few
other challenges along the way,

538
00:29:28,889 --> 00:29:31,250
but, actually,
life can be pretty normal.

539
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:35,889
But here's the thing, Ram.

540
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:40,609
Pretty normal's not what I dreamt of
all my life.

541
00:29:41,649 --> 00:29:44,250
Pretty normal's not what I want.

542
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:48,569
What I want is actual normal.

543
00:29:48,609 --> 00:29:51,970
I want a child that does
all the boring, ordinary things

544
00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:53,649
that other kids do,

545
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:55,889
not one who attracts
well-meaning smiles and,

546
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:58,530
"Haven't they done well,
considering?"

547
00:29:58,569 --> 00:30:02,530
I want a child that behaves
appallingly when they're a teenager,

548
00:30:02,569 --> 00:30:05,450
gets pissed too young
and takes drugs and scares us

549
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:08,169
and then becomes nice again
in their 20s.

550
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:12,649
I want another life for us,
when they're 18 and they leave home.

551
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:17,849
I want grandkids.

552
00:30:18,889 --> 00:30:22,889
And I am so aware this makes me
sound absolutely appalling.

553
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:24,609
<font color="yellow">It doesn't make you sound appalling.</font>

554
00:30:24,649 --> 00:30:26,609
But I'm just trying
to be honest with you.

555
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:31,369
I don't think I'm a good enough
person to go on that journey.

556
00:30:32,409 --> 00:30:34,010
And, truthfully...

557
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:37,409
..I think I would resent that life.

558
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:40,329
<font color="yellow">And I'm sure</font>
<font color="yellow">that's a pretty normal reaction.</font>

559
00:30:43,089 --> 00:30:44,409
Was it yours?

560
00:30:46,809 --> 00:30:48,329
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

561
00:30:53,169 --> 00:30:54,409
So...

562
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:57,050
<font color="yellow">If we found out tomorrow,</font>
<font color="yellow">unequivocally,</font>

563
00:30:57,089 --> 00:30:59,809
<font color="yellow">that he or she had Down's,</font>

564
00:30:59,849 --> 00:31:01,690
<font color="yellow">I'd wanna go ahead</font>
<font color="yellow">with the pregnancy.</font>

565
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:03,889
<font color="yellow">I mean, in the end,</font>
<font color="yellow">I think it has to be your decision,</font>

566
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:08,250
<font color="yellow">but if it was down to me,</font>
<font color="yellow">then, yeah, I would go ahead.</font>

567
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:09,889
No doubts at all?

568
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:11,649
<font color="yellow">No, not really.</font>

569
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:16,530
<font color="yellow">I just know that when the doctor</font>
<font color="yellow">said there was an issue,</font>

570
00:31:16,569 --> 00:31:18,930
<font color="yellow">it never made me want to end it.</font>

571
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:21,609
<font color="yellow">I guess you'll have to go</font>
<font color="yellow">with your gut instincts.</font>

572
00:31:21,649 --> 00:31:24,649
<font color="yellow">I just knew I hated the idea</font>
<font color="yellow">of stopping a life,</font>

573
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:27,169
<font color="yellow">just because it wasn't</font>
<font color="yellow">the perceived idea of perfect.</font>

574
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:29,369
<font color="yellow">I mean, what the fuck</font>
<font color="yellow">is perfect anyway?</font>

575
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:32,770
CLEARS HIS THROAT

576
00:31:32,809 --> 00:31:36,490
<font color="yellow">There's a crack in everything, Anna.</font>
<font color="yellow">That's how the light gets in.</font>

577
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:41,889
<font color="yellow">And were they as generous</font>
<font color="yellow">as you hoped?</font>

578
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:44,210
Yeah, they were.

579
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:46,849
<font color="yellow">Well, that's lovely.</font>
It was...

580
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:49,490
It was life-affirming.

581
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:07,129
Change of plan, Claire.

582
00:32:07,169 --> 00:32:08,770
I've got no appointments
this morning,

583
00:32:08,809 --> 00:32:10,970
so I'm gonna go to Aldercroft,
help them clean up.

584
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:12,930
Be a couple of hours.
<font color="yellow">No worries.</font>

585
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:22,849
Hi, DCI Cassie Stuart.

586
00:32:57,770 --> 00:33:00,409
DI Khan, Bishop Street,
looking for DCI Sidhu.

587
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:03,690

593
00:33:21,225 --> 00:33:22,864
<font color="yellow">Can you pass me one of those chairs?</font>

594
00:33:22,904 --> 00:33:26,184
<font color="yellow">Jack, over here.</font>
<font color="yellow">You are good. Very good.</font>

595
00:33:26,225 --> 00:33:28,465
Mr Barton?
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

596
00:33:28,505 --> 00:33:29,904
Tracked you down at last.

597
00:33:29,944 --> 00:33:31,624
DCI Cassie Stuart.

598
00:33:31,664 --> 00:33:33,985
I'm investigating
an historic murder,

599
00:33:34,025 --> 00:33:36,184
and I wonder if you had time
for a quick chat?

600
00:33:37,065 --> 00:33:38,584
<font color="yellow">Er... Yeah.</font>

601
00:33:38,624 --> 00:33:40,104
<font color="yellow">Yeah, yeah.</font>

602
00:33:40,144 --> 00:33:41,944
<font color="yellow">Jack, do you want to go over</font>
<font color="yellow">to them?</font>

603
00:33:41,985 --> 00:33:43,825
<font color="yellow">I'll be back in a minute.</font>
<font color="yellow">Go to the girls.</font>

604
00:33:43,864 --> 00:33:46,305
<font color="yellow">I'll be back in a couple of minutes.</font>
<font color="yellow">Straight through there.</font>

605
00:33:54,904 --> 00:33:56,504
<font color="yellow">Morning.</font>
DI Khan.

606
00:33:57,544 --> 00:33:59,424
Thank you.

607
00:33:59,464 --> 00:34:02,665
<font color="yellow">So, this has to be a first.</font>

608
00:34:02,705 --> 00:34:05,265
What is?
<font color="yellow">Two of us in the same building.</font>

609
00:34:05,305 --> 00:34:06,745
<font color="yellow">Fuck me.</font>
HE CHUCKLES

610
00:34:06,785 --> 00:34:08,904
<font color="yellow">Wonders will never cease.</font>

611
00:34:08,944 --> 00:34:11,344
Ah, right, yes, indeed.

612
00:34:11,384 --> 00:34:13,625
<font color="yellow">Have we met before?</font>
<font color="yellow">I feel like we've met before.</font>

613
00:34:13,665 --> 00:34:15,344
No, I don't think so.

614
00:34:15,384 --> 00:34:17,864
<font color="yellow">Maybe at a BPA bash?</font>
<font color="yellow">Your face looks familiar.</font>

615
00:34:17,904 --> 00:34:19,825
I'm not a member of the BPA, so...

616
00:34:19,864 --> 00:34:23,544
<font color="yellow">Oh, OK, interesting.</font>

617
00:34:24,745 --> 00:34:27,424
<font color="yellow">Anyway, how can I help you?</font>

618
00:34:27,464 --> 00:34:32,064
So, I'm part of a team that's
investigating an historical murder,

619
00:34:32,105 --> 00:34:34,344
we're just following up
on preliminary leads,

620
00:34:34,384 --> 00:34:36,864
and we think you can help us
throw some light

621
00:34:36,904 --> 00:34:39,665
on the events of an evening,
some 30 years ago,

622
00:34:39,705 --> 00:34:41,265
connected to the victim's death.

623
00:34:41,305 --> 00:34:44,464
<font color="yellow">30 years ago? Don't think I was even</font>
<font color="yellow">a police officer 30 years ago.</font>

624
00:34:44,504 --> 00:34:46,105
<font color="yellow">I certainly wasn't a detective.</font>

625
00:34:46,145 --> 00:34:48,705
Sorry, that's a misunderstanding.

626
00:34:48,745 --> 00:34:52,464
It's not a case that you have
any connection with as an officer,

627
00:34:52,504 --> 00:34:55,785
it was when you were a civilian.
A police probationer, actually.

628
00:34:55,825 --> 00:34:58,944
<font color="yellow">As a possible witness to a crime?</font>

629
00:34:58,984 --> 00:35:01,145
We hope so.

630
00:35:02,984 --> 00:35:05,145
<font color="yellow">Yeah, we're done.</font>

631
00:35:05,185 --> 00:35:08,384
I'm sorry? <font color="yellow">You want to interview me,</font>
<font color="yellow">we do it with a brief.</font>

632
00:35:08,424 --> 00:35:11,785
DCI Sidhu... <font color="yellow">I would have expected</font>
<font color="yellow">better of you, DI Khan.</font>

633
00:35:15,265 --> 00:35:17,825
<font color="yellow">Or maybe you're just</font>
<font color="yellow">one of their coconuts.</font>

634
00:35:19,864 --> 00:35:21,024
I'll be in touch.

635
00:35:22,464 --> 00:35:25,265
<font color="yellow">And whoever sent you from upstairs,</font>
<font color="yellow">tell them nice try, but no cigar.</font>

636
00:35:30,024 --> 00:35:32,145
But just to remind you, this test,

637
00:35:32,185 --> 00:35:35,105
even alongside the ultrasound,
is not diagnostic.

638
00:35:36,544 --> 00:35:39,185
For a diagnosis,
you'd need an amniocentesis.

639
00:35:41,825 --> 00:35:43,305
Obviously, I'm sure you're aware,

640
00:35:43,344 --> 00:35:45,504
that does carry
a small risk of miscarriage.

641
00:35:49,705 --> 00:35:52,225
<font color="yellow">Would you offer me a NIPT test?</font>

642
00:35:54,384 --> 00:35:57,464
Jenny calls it as she sees it,
which can be irritating.

643
00:35:57,504 --> 00:36:01,305
Sometimes, she struggles to
understand other people's feelings.

644
00:36:01,344 --> 00:36:06,145
But she's funny and clever,
and loving.

645
00:36:06,185 --> 00:36:09,024
<font color="yellow">Good. You're a lucky man.</font>

646
00:36:09,064 --> 00:36:10,585
Yes, I am.

647
00:36:11,785 --> 00:36:15,265
And she has nothing.
In monetary terms, I mean.

648
00:36:15,305 --> 00:36:18,944
She has no savings,
and she rents her little flat.

649
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:21,665
And...

650
00:36:22,944 --> 00:36:26,424
Well... given what I know
that she'll be doing for me

651
00:36:26,464 --> 00:36:28,305
in the next year or so,

652
00:36:28,344 --> 00:36:31,265
it felt like a small...

653
00:36:31,305 --> 00:36:33,064
erm...

654
00:36:33,105 --> 00:36:34,864
Oh, arsing bollocks.
<font color="yellow">Recompense?</font>

655
00:36:34,904 --> 00:36:37,904
Recompense. Exactly, yes.
Recompense. Thanks, Adam.

656
00:36:37,944 --> 00:36:41,544
<font color="yellow">I get it, Grandad.</font>
<font color="yellow">Don't worry, I understand.</font>

657
00:36:46,265 --> 00:36:48,464
Well, I knew you would.
Thanks, Adam.

658
00:36:49,785 --> 00:36:52,384
<font color="yellow">So, good health.</font>

659
00:36:52,424 --> 00:36:57,665
Oh, I'm afraid that ship's already
left the port. To youth.

660
00:37:04,344 --> 00:37:06,344
<font color="yellow">No. Sorry, no.</font>

661
00:37:06,384 --> 00:37:08,305
<font color="yellow">As I say, I do remember Rob.</font>

662
00:37:08,344 --> 00:37:10,625
<font color="yellow">And that night, of course.</font>
<font color="yellow">How could you not?</font>

663
00:37:10,665 --> 00:37:12,585
<font color="yellow">But not this lad.</font>

664
00:37:12,625 --> 00:37:16,105
And you have no recollection
of Mr Fogerty stopping the car

665
00:37:16,145 --> 00:37:18,064
at any point
before he was pulled over?

666
00:37:18,105 --> 00:37:21,864
<font color="yellow">No. But, I mean, we'd all had a few,</font>

667
00:37:21,904 --> 00:37:24,105
<font color="yellow">so I can't swear, but...</font>
Sure.

668
00:37:24,145 --> 00:37:26,665
So, you only actually
stayed in the force a few weeks

669
00:37:26,705 --> 00:37:28,424
after passing out, Dean.
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

670
00:37:28,464 --> 00:37:31,305
And why was that?
<font color="yellow">Just wasn't for me.</font>

671
00:37:31,344 --> 00:37:34,544
<font color="yellow">I mean, I quickly realised</font>
<font color="yellow">I didn't like taking orders,</font>

672
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:36,544
<font color="yellow">which is not ideal.</font>
Fair enough.

673
00:37:36,585 --> 00:37:38,984
<font color="yellow">I dunno that I'd have been</font>
<font color="yellow">particularly good at it.</font>

674
00:37:39,024 --> 00:37:40,944
<font color="yellow">Didn't feel I had the right</font>
<font color="yellow">sort of brain.</font>

675
00:37:41,984 --> 00:37:43,544
<font color="yellow">Guess I'm not much of a team player.</font>

676
00:37:43,585 --> 00:37:46,904
<font color="yellow">I think I'm more of a one-man band</font>
<font color="yellow">sort of bloke. </font>That's a shame.

677
00:37:46,944 --> 00:37:49,785
You obviously do have leadership
skills. I saw your offices.

678
00:37:49,825 --> 00:37:52,984
Your secretary was telling me
about your event here last night.

679
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:54,984
<font color="yellow">Was she?</font>

680
00:37:55,024 --> 00:37:56,625
Maybe you underestimate yourself.

681
00:37:56,665 --> 00:37:58,825
<font color="yellow">Maybe. Never know.</font>

682
00:38:00,904 --> 00:38:03,064
And did you stay in touch
with any of them?

683
00:38:03,105 --> 00:38:05,344
<font color="yellow">No. No, it was just a few weeks</font>
<font color="yellow">of my life.</font>

684
00:38:05,384 --> 00:38:08,424
29, the initial training period was,
back then.

685
00:38:08,464 --> 00:38:11,185
<font color="yellow">Yeah, but in comparative terms,</font>
<font color="yellow">it's a very brief window.</font>

686
00:38:11,225 --> 00:38:13,384
<font color="yellow">I mean, in fact,</font>
<font color="yellow">this is pretty much the first time</font>

687
00:38:13,424 --> 00:38:15,424
<font color="yellow">I've heard any of their names</font>
<font color="yellow">in 30 years.</font>

688
00:38:35,464 --> 00:38:37,625
Excuse me, mate. DC Jake Collier.

689
00:38:37,665 --> 00:38:39,625
Can I have a quick word?

690
00:38:39,665 --> 00:38:41,785
<font color="yellow">You was at St Bede's, wasn't you?</font>

691
00:38:41,825 --> 00:38:42,944
Yeah.

692
00:38:42,984 --> 00:38:46,544
<font color="yellow">Yeah, you were a prefect, man.</font>

693
00:38:46,585 --> 00:38:49,024
I was, yeah.
Long time. How you doing?

694
00:38:49,064 --> 00:38:51,464
<font color="yellow">Bruv, you were a proper dickhead.</font>

695
00:38:51,504 --> 00:38:53,625
Was I?

696
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:54,944
<font color="yellow">And you became a copper.</font>

697
00:38:54,984 --> 00:38:59,265
<font color="yellow">Fuck's sake, man, why would you</font>
<font color="yellow">ever want to be a copper?</font>

698
00:39:01,585 --> 00:39:05,225
<font color="yellow">So, why would someone do that,</font>
<font color="yellow">do you think, in your experience?</font>

699
00:39:05,265 --> 00:39:07,464
<font color="yellow">Cut the hands and head off a body?</font>

700
00:39:08,785 --> 00:39:12,665
Usually, it's done
just prior to disposal,

701
00:39:12,705 --> 00:39:14,864
to obscure identification.

702
00:39:14,904 --> 00:39:18,064
<font color="yellow">Right, and you reckon what,</font>
<font color="yellow">he just bottled it, Fogerty?</font>

703
00:39:19,225 --> 00:39:20,665
I guess.

704
00:39:23,745 --> 00:39:26,705
<font color="yellow">You never know, do you,</font>
<font color="yellow">what someone's capable of.</font>

705
00:39:26,745 --> 00:39:28,504
No, you don't.

706
00:39:31,944 --> 00:39:34,145
Thanks for your time, Mr Barton.
<font color="yellow">Yeah, pleasure.</font>

707
00:39:42,544 --> 00:39:44,745
<font color="yellow">Yeah, here he is.</font>

708
00:39:44,785 --> 00:39:48,145
<font color="yellow">Robert Fogerty, 224G.</font>

709
00:39:48,185 --> 00:39:51,864
<font color="yellow">Rented a space here for eight years.</font>

710
00:40:06,705 --> 00:40:08,705

PHONE RINGS

712
00:40:16,585 --> 00:40:19,745
It's me. We need to meet.

713
00:40:52,585 --> 00:40:53,944
Love?

714
00:41:01,904 --> 00:41:03,825
Hey, come here.

715
00:41:12,384 --> 00:41:13,705
Liz?

716
00:41:16,185 --> 00:41:18,105
It's Fiona.

717
00:41:18,145 --> 00:41:20,024
Grayson, from Hendon.

718
00:41:26,745 --> 00:41:28,424
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

719
00:41:28,464 --> 00:41:30,585
<font color="yellow">Are you insane?</font>

720
00:41:30,625 --> 00:41:32,745
We need to speak.

721
00:41:35,984 --> 00:41:37,504
Tomorrow, 11 o'clock,

722
00:41:37,544 --> 00:41:40,665
St Saviour's Park, by the bridge.

723
00:41:40,705 --> 00:41:43,024
Wear a hoodie, don't drive.

724
00:41:44,504 --> 00:41:46,424
Pay for your train ticket in cash.

725
00:42:00,625 --> 00:42:05,064
<font color="yellow">He was cagey and prickly,</font>
<font color="yellow">which might indicate something,</font>

726
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:07,024
<font color="yellow">but I then researched him,</font>

727
00:42:07,064 --> 00:42:09,625
<font color="yellow">turns out he's got a 30-year history</font>
<font color="yellow">of being cagey and prickly.</font>

728
00:42:09,665 --> 00:42:13,544
At work? <font color="yellow">Multiple misconduct issues,</font>
<font color="yellow">an allegation of using drugs,</font>

729
00:42:13,585 --> 00:42:17,145
<font color="yellow">one of using prostitutes,</font>
<font color="yellow">another one of fabricating evidence,</font>

730
00:42:17,185 --> 00:42:19,825
<font color="yellow">a load more low level stuff.</font>
Jesus, how's he still employed?

731
00:42:19,864 --> 00:42:22,864
<font color="yellow">Cos he fought and won them all.</font>
<font color="yellow">Every single one.</font>

732
00:42:22,904 --> 00:42:26,024
<font color="yellow">He's been very vocal about saying</font>
<font color="yellow">they were all racially motivated.</font>

733
00:42:27,585 --> 00:42:28,864
So what was he like with you?

734
00:42:28,904 --> 00:42:31,145
<font color="yellow">Fine, until he realised</font>
<font color="yellow">why I was there,</font>

735
00:42:31,185 --> 00:42:32,585
<font color="yellow">then he pretty much kicked me out.</font>

736
00:42:32,625 --> 00:42:35,544
<font color="yellow">I maybe lasted two minutes.</font>
OK. Wow.

737
00:42:35,585 --> 00:42:38,305
<font color="yellow">Yeah, wow. How was Dean Barton?</font>

738
00:42:38,344 --> 00:42:43,265
Open and friendly, and...
rather lovely, actually.

739
00:42:43,305 --> 00:42:46,504
Although am I just thinking that
because he has a disabled son

740
00:42:46,544 --> 00:42:48,504
and he does stuff for charity?

741
00:42:48,544 --> 00:42:50,705
<font color="yellow">I give you Jimmy Savile.</font>
Exactly.

742
00:42:52,864 --> 00:42:56,265
<font color="yellow">Bottom line, though,</font>
<font color="yellow">we've now seen all four of them.</font>

743
00:42:58,265 --> 00:42:59,665
CLEARS HER THROAT

744
00:43:02,225 --> 00:43:04,424
So, I do have agendas,
you're absolutely right.

745
00:43:04,464 --> 00:43:07,544
Much as I might
try and tell myself I don't.

746
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:11,544
And we don't have any real evidence
of anything yet.

747
00:43:13,904 --> 00:43:16,064
But my instinct tells me
we're onto something.

748
00:43:17,984 --> 00:43:19,384
<font color="yellow">Under normal circumstances,</font>

749
00:43:19,424 --> 00:43:21,785
<font color="yellow">I'd say that your instincts</font>
<font color="yellow">are always rock solid.</font>

750
00:43:21,825 --> 00:43:23,504
<font color="yellow">But as you say,</font>

751
00:43:23,544 --> 00:43:25,825
<font color="yellow">you've got a lot of things</font>
<font color="yellow">going on for you at the moment.</font>

752
00:43:25,864 --> 00:43:27,665
<font color="yellow">I just think</font>
<font color="yellow">we need to tread carefully.</font>

753
00:43:29,585 --> 00:43:32,665
<font color="yellow">Why don't we sleep on it,</font>
<font color="yellow">talk about it in the morning?</font>

754
00:43:32,705 --> 00:43:34,544
<font color="yellow">I moved in with Sal today.</font>

755
00:43:34,585 --> 00:43:36,544
<font color="yellow">It might be an idea</font>
<font color="yellow">if I turned up at some point.</font>

756
00:43:36,585 --> 00:43:38,825
Oh, I think that might be
a very good idea. <font color="yellow">OK.</font>

757
00:43:39,904 --> 00:43:41,424
Night, Sunny.
<font color="yellow">Night, boss.</font>

758
00:44:32,904 --> 00:44:34,024
<font color="yellow">Boss?</font>

759
00:44:34,064 --> 00:44:36,944
<font color="yellow">I have a witness</font>
<font color="yellow">who can 100% confirm</font>

760
00:44:36,984 --> 00:44:39,585
<font color="yellow">that Walsh was being chased.</font>

761
00:44:39,625 --> 00:44:42,305
By?
<font color="yellow">He saw two men running after him,</font>

762
00:44:42,344 --> 00:44:44,225
<font color="yellow">one of whom</font>
<font color="yellow">actually called out his name.</font>

763
00:44:44,265 --> 00:44:46,424
One of them knew his name?
<font color="yellow">Yep.</font>

764
00:44:46,464 --> 00:44:50,665
Any description of the men?
<font color="yellow">One Asian, one unusually tall.</font>

765
00:44:52,024 --> 00:44:53,625
So, a chase changes everything.

766
00:44:53,665 --> 00:44:56,225
A chase suggests, at the very least,

767
00:44:56,265 --> 00:44:58,424
that his murder
was in some way provoked.

769

00:45:03,904 --> 00:45:05,665
