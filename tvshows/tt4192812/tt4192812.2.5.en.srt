1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,710
David Walker had a lot of secrets.

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:03,670
We've just found another -- Ellen Price.

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,190
If they got friendly with him,

4
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:06,990
they'd get invited to the gatherings.

5
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,230
She was 12 years old. David
Walker sexually assaulted her.

6
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,790
If this is true, I promise
you, I knew nothing about it.

7
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,880
You clearly had no idea what sort
of a person your husband was.

8
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,870
We need to consider the possibility
that one of these people

9
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,230
were assaulted by Walker.
The question is, which?

10
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,030
What the hell have you done?

11
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,950
Don't blame me! She was the one
who done it in the first place.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,070
- What do you want?
- What we want is 20 grand

13
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,390
or we tell social services

14
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,510
about your husband being interviewed
in connection with a murder.

15
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,670
The city in the '80s, was it
really as brutal as everyone says?

16
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:38,760
- It screwed me up so much, I could
have killed someone. - Did it?

17
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,760
An allegation was made by a Maria
Gonzalez. She said he raped her.

18
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,310
The police have found people
that I hung about with...

19
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,270
- in the '80s.
- What people?

20
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,390
IRA.

21
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:52,760
- Did you ever see her
with this man? - No...

22
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,180
but she wanted us to kill him.

31
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,240
I did always keep stuff.

32
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,860
Silly bits of receipts and things.

33
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,460
There'll be something that
proves I was there, abroad.

34
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,320
All right, well...

35
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,400
I'll start this side.

36
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,270
- Bye, Daddy. I love you.
- Bye, sweetheart, I love you.

37
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:18,260
- And remember, don't be late.
- I won't.

38
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,310
- You didn't call me back.
- Someone stole my phone.

39
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,430
When's our money coming?

40
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,960
I can have it for you by Wednesday.

41
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,670
I just want to be sure you're
making the right choices.

42
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,470
- I'm making the right choices?
- Because like I said last week,

43
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm not the kind of man who forgets
when someone screws him over.

44
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,070
That's very Liam Neeson.

45
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,860
3:00, Wednesday, in the cafe. Be there.

46
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,800
OK, thank you.

47
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,520
She was in a B&B in Havering,

48
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:16,080
the landlady found her when she
didn't come down for breakfast.

49
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,110
- Found her?
- Unconscious.

50
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,110
They're taking her in to St Agatha's now.

51
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,960
- Is she gonna be OK?
- I have no idea.

52
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,390
Love, I'm sorry.

53
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,630
You see, you asked me to
take the wall down, Tony,

54
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,030
but that's what's behind it --

55
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,560
what I did to her and what I do to every
single relationship I've ever had --

56
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,440
try to fuck it up.

57
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,630
You're over-reacting.

58
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,720
Cos I'm pissed off you stayed
married to a child-abuser?

59
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,310
Sorry, but I wanna go home now.

60
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,560
Oh, what, to that depressing little
flat and your pretend friends?

61
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,960
Oh, God, Jason, I'm sorry.

62
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,600
Come on.

63
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,160
What is this? We've always
been there for each other.

64
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:59,400
And I always thought that
was cos I needed you.

65
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,470
Please, love, don't...

66
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,200
Jason. Jason, please.

67
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,320
Please, love.

68
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,230
Please, don't leave me on my own.

69
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,550
I think being on your own
is just what you need.

70
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,070
Time to think about who you are.

71
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,430
So, first we need to identify the house,

72
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,590
and if we can do that,
then we'll try and find

73
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,230
the owner at the relevant time.

74
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,030
- Which was when?
- Erm...

75
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,040
Our witness says the gatherings
took place between 1981 and 1983.

76
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,190
- And this is... Ellen Price...
- Hm.

77
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,790
.. who was at a reform school
when she says this happened?

78
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,160
And is a very successful
marketing executive now.

79
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,150
And do we have any reason to
believe any of your suspects

80
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,550
could have ever found
themselves at this address?

81
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,880
Well, that's our primary focus now.

82
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,550
Were they in London at
that time? Were they...

83
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,240
- vulnerable, in care? All
of that sort of stuff. - OK.

84
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,320
With Marion Kelsey being our priority

85
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,710
after Sinead Quinn's statement yesterday.

86
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,150
And clearly, if what Ms
Price is saying is true,

87
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,750
then we're looking at a
whole separate investigation.

88
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,230
Possible multiple sexual
assaults on children.

89
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,880
- Multiple suspects.
- Maybe, yes.

90
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,710
Well, I know you'll be aware

91
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,790
of how carefully we
need to tread here, Cass.

92
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,630
Notwithstanding the mistakes
that we have made in the past,

93
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,880
there are also some very
unreliable witnesses out there.

94
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,750
Very aware of that, sir,

95
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,540
and we'll tread very carefully indeed.

96
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,910
So, cos a few unfortunate
people made some stuff up,

97
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,590
suddenly it's all made up, again,

98
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,430
like it has been for the last 50 years.

99
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,150
Yeah, I know. It's rubbish, isn't it?

100
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,960
Listen...

101
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,870
.. I'm sorry if I got arsey the other day.

102
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,260
I'm sorry if I got arsey, too.

103
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:53,640
I think... with my girls,

104
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,910
I just get very emotional about it all.

105
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,400
No, yeah, I get it.

106
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,620
Hm.

107
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,070
So, where are we with Maudsley?

108
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,200
We still need to know if Colin
Osborne could have ever got out.

109
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:09,400
Yeah, yeah, no, I'll chase
up, and the airline manifests.

110
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:14,160
Oh, OK. And then I want
Marion, Sara and Colin in,

111
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,590
all three of 'em together.

112
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,150
- What are we saying, a
voluntary interview? - Hm.

113
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,110
And we're gonna need photos of
them when they were teenagers,

114
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,790
I wanna show them to Ellen Price.

115
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,110
Oh, we can't use photo ID from Price.

116
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,200
I'm not worried about evidence,
I wanna know I'm not going mad.

117
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,030
You don't wanna concentrate
on just Marion Kelsey for now?

118
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,150
No, I don't think so.

119
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,230
Maybe they were all at
one of these parties.

120
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,550
- They all knew each
other, you mean? - Why not?

121
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,830
And maybe all three were
involved in his murder,

122
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,070
so I want it coordinated.

123
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:43,280
I want them all in the front
office at the same time.

124
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,880
So, Maria Gonzalez.

125
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,400
We placed her with Klein
Egerton on 13th March, 1990.

126
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,910
13th, that's interesting.

127
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,120
- And she left on the 17th
it says there. - Right.

128
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,360
And was this her home
address at that time here?

129
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,030
- Yeah.
- It's been really helpful.

130
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,910
Would you mind if I took a copy of this?

131
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,510
You can have it, love. She
hasn't been back in 26 years,

132
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:15,060
so I don't think we'll be
getting any return business.

133
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,950
Sorry, what's this here?

134
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,200
That's just her reference,
her previous employer.

135
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,070
- David Walker?
- Yeah.

136
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,360
I went online at Companies House
and looked at his accounts,

137
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,110
Gonzalez worked for Walker for 18 months

138
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,350
before she temped at Klein Egerton's.

139
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,680
- As what?
- A dancer.

140
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,550
And she'd only been at Klein's two days

141
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,200
before she made the rape allegation.

142
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,680
OK, so we have photos of
Osbourne with Walker in February,

143
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,030
and then a few weeks later,

144
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,840
a woman who clearly knows Walker
very well gets a temp job at Klein's.

145
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:01,910
And within two days, she accuses
Colin Osbourne, a gay man,

146
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,230
of raping her.

147
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,600
So, even in 1990, a woman makes
a very public accusation of rape,

148
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,110
you'd reasonably assume the
police would be called.

149
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,950
- Yeah.
- The man would be interviewed,

150
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,590
at the very least, his
reputation is seriously damaged,

151
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,310
at the very worst, he goes to trial.

152
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,320
- Except this is banking and they...
- It's all handled internally. - Yeah.

153
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,880
But if you took that anomaly out of
the equation, you'd have to assume

154
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,080
that someone wanted Colin Osbourne
out the picture, wouldn't you?

155
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,700
And that someone was David Walker.

156
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,700
Hi. Mr Osbourne?

157
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:43,780
DC Fran Lingley. Can I have a quick word?

158
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:51,010
Hello, young man. DS Murray Boulting.

159
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:53,400
Is your mum or dad in, please?

160
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,780
Hello, there. DC Jake Collier.

161
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:01,860
Have you got five minutes
please, Mrs Kelsey?

162
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,780
This is it.

163
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,900
It's here.

164
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,420
Yeah, it's that one over there.

165
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:21,520
- How sure?
- 100%.

166
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:25,000
It's the number.

167
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:28,860
There was a joke going
around around that time.

168
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:34,180
99 is like a 69, except you
shove a flake up your...

169
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:40,060
He told me that gag the
first time we were there.

170
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:44,260
Yeah. There.

171
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:46,570
So, how many times did you come here?

172
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,410
- Three.
- Always with Walker?

173
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:50,610
He was always the one
that picked me up, yeah.

174
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,930
- From your school.
- Yeah.

175
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,810
So, what did your
headmaster say about that?

176
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:01,160
The gatherings were supposed
to be prayer evenings.

177
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:04,090
There was a bloke there
that was something to do

178
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,890
with the local church.

179
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,570
We were supposed to be reading the Bible,

180
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,700
talking about God.

181
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,900
No...

182
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,640
.. it was never a problem, no.

183
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:22,500
And Walker would... would
pick you up in his car?

184
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:25,320
In a taxi, he came straight from work.

185
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,850
And how would you get back from the party?

186
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,240
Sorry...

187
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,160
.. this is weird, I've erm...

188
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:40,540
.. I've never talked
about this in 35 years.

189
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:43,420
Not to my husband, not to anyone.

190
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,900
- If you want to stop...
- No.

191
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:49,250
It's fine. It's all right, it's fine.

192
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,600
Twice...

193
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:56,420
.. he put me in a taxi to take me back.

194
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:01,900
- Right. - And another time,
there was a woman that...

195
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,740
drove us back.

196
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:07,500
- Was that a woman from the party?
- No, she just turned up outside.

197
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:11,210
She had a row with Walker
on the pavement there,

198
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,490
she was screaming at him,

199
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:16,180
- I think she was his wife or
girlfriend or something. - OK.

200
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:22,420
And how many other children were here?

201
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,620
There were never less than half a dozen.

202
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,860
- Age range?
- The youngest was about 12.

203
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,810
The oldest maybe...

204
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,010
.. 16.

205
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38,060
And how many adults?

206
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,100
About the same.

207
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,570
There was something for everyone.

208
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:51,810
If I showed you some photographs
of some other children

209
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,610
we think might have been here as well,

210
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:56,740
- do you think you might be able
to recognise any of them? - Er...

211
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,580
I suppose it's worth a try, yeah.

212
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:03,800
Hm.

213
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:08,420
I'm so sorry. I'll just...
I'll be two minutes.

214
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:12,060
Are you OK?

215
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,500
Yeah, I'm fine.

216
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,970
- Sunny.
- So the Maudsley say

217
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:30,850
they had a soft locked-door
policy in the 1990s,

218
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,930
meaning that it was
hard but not impossible

219
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:34,370
for a patient to walk out.

220
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,410
But can they confirm Osborne was there?

221
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:38,850
Yeah, yeah, for the
exact dates he stipulated

222
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:41,370
and there's no record of
him absconding at any time.

223
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:42,650
But they can't rule it out?

224
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:46,220
- If he was in and out within
a few hours, then, no. - OK.

225
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,570
And then Sara Alazi,

226
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:50,780
we have found both her
outbound flight in March

227
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,570
and her inbound flight in December.

228
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:55,610
But what we can't do
is check every airline,

229
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,410
rail service, ferry service

230
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:00,090
for every day between her
departure and the 8th of May

231
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:02,690
to see if she returned here at any point.

232
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,620
No, OK, thanks. Listen, right now

233
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,330
I need you to pull Tessa Nixon in again.

234
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:11,860
My witness here might be able to
place her at this house in Brentford.

235
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:14,940
- Wow.
- Yeah, I know. Thanks.

236
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,440
Hm.

237
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,660
Hello. Can I help?

238
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:33,340
- Hi, there. DCI Cassie Stuart,
Bishop Street Station. - OK.

239
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,650
You don't happen to know
who lives here, do you?

240
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:39,620
- Oh, yeah, that's Pete and Katie.
- Right, looks like they've got kids?

241
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:43,500
One, Rosie, she's three
now, and then one on the way.

242
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:46,250
- Have they been here long?
- Oh, about five or six years?

243
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:49,290
You don't happen to know who
lived here before them, do you?

244
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:52,130
Before them was Ken, he
was here donkey's years.

245
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:55,130
- Do you remember his surname?
- Er... no.

246
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,970
But he worked for the council, I think,

247
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:59,010
some sort of social service or something.

248
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:03,420
And when you say "donkey's years",
roughly how long did he live here?

249
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,580
Well before me and I've
been here since '79.

250
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,770
Right.

251
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,440
- Brilliant. - OK.
- Thanks for your help.

252
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:15,700
Oh. Sorry, just one more thing.

253
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:18,170
You don't have any idea
where he moved to, do you?

254
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:21,460
Oh, yeah. About half a
mile down that road...

255
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:24,010
to the cemetery. He's dead, love.

256
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,100
Thank you.

257
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,450
She is out of line doing this.

258
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,410
You could have rung me, I'd have come up.

259
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:38,780
Come on, let's not make this any
harder than it needs to be, Tess.

260
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:41,060
Detective Inspector Nixon.

261
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,610
Sorry, Marion, can you bear
with us for two minutes?

262
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,930
- Bit short on interview rooms.
- Yeah, sure.

263
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:03,420
Do you wanna take a seat?
Grab you a tea or a coffee?

264
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:07,300
- Yeah, I'll have a tea. Milk,
no sugar, please. - No worries.

265
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:18,050
As I said, Colin, you're
obviously not being arrested,

266
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,090
but you will be questioned under caution,

267
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:22,410
so would you like a solicitor present?

268
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:24,210
No, I'll be fine, thank you.

269
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:27,130
OK. Just grab a seat, I'll be right back.

270
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:43,380
Do you recognise this girl?

271
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,900
No, sorry.

272
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,300
No problem.

273
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:01,060
What about this one?

274
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:10,140
Show me the next one.

275
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:24,160
Show me the middle one again.

276
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:36,500
It was 35 years ago and I was drunk...

277
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:42,220
.. but this girl...

278
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:45,100
I'm pretty certain she was at the party.

279
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:48,460
I'm pretty certain I recognise her.

280
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:00,570
- Have any of them spoken
to each other? - No.

281
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:04,020
- Looked at each other?
- Nothing. - Which is weird.

282
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,890
Weird?

283
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:11,460
Well, you nod at people in a
situation like this, don't you?

284
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:14,020
You talk about the weather...

285
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,770
shit coffee...

286
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,980
Don't you?

287
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,000
I guess.

288
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:25,140
OK, you do Tessa.

289
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,420
I'll do Marion.

290
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,690
I gave evidence against her.

291
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:33,050
- Why would she not try
and drop me in it? - Hm.

292
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:36,860
So you think that's why Sinead Quinn
said this stuff about you and Walker?

293
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:38,860
Absolutely.

294
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:42,180
And so how do you think
she knew who he was?

295
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:46,530
Well, maybe it was her who
identified him as a possible target?

296
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:49,450
- Her who wrote that address down?
- Of your parents' house?

297
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,170
She was my girlfriend at the time,

298
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:54,260
we stayed there on several occasions
when my parents were away.

299
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:57,250
But whichever of you it was
gave him your parents' address

300
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:00,500
on the 7th of May, that's the
day before he disappeared...

301
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:03,980
it suggests you were staying
there, in North London.

302
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,090
Yeah, I guess so.

303
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:10,580
Just a few miles from where David
Walker's body was eventually found.

304
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:15,660
OK, I want, if I may, Marion...

305
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:19,900
.. to ask you a couple of
questions about your childhood?

306
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:22,780
So, you were brought up by your parents?

307
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,500
- Yes.
- Hm.

308
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:27,810
- And you lived with
them till what age? - 16.

309
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,810
Did you have any problems with the police?

310
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:32,090
Other than the one
you've asked me about, no.

311
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:35,380
- You never spent any time in any
youth-detention facilities? - No.

312
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:40,170
- No periods in care.
- No.

313
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:44,610
- You ever run away from home?
- No.

314
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:49,770
- And your mother would corroborate
this, would she? - Yes.

315
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:53,340
Does the address 99 Shanklin Avenue

316
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:56,360
- in Brentford mean
anything to you? - No.

317
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,700
This is it.

318
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,490
I've never seen it before.

319
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,570
You've never been to any parties there?

320
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:09,380
A party? Jesus. I don't know, when?

321
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:13,300
At some point between 1981 and 1983.

322
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,450
- OK, well I think that's fairly unlikely.
- And why's that?

323
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,410
Well, firstly I was only 14 in 1983

324
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:21,410
and my parents were not that
relaxed about that sort of thing.

325
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,570
But more to the point, I don't think

326
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:26,660
they would have been that happy
about driving me to Brentford,

327
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:30,180
given that between 1980 and
1985, we lived in Ireland.

328
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,010
If he was doing this sort of stuff,

329
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:36,850
how on Earth would I
have known about it? Hm?

330
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,930
He would have done
everything he could have

331
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:41,320
to keep it from me, obviously.

332
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:44,530
Except wives often do
suspect, Tessa, you know that,

333
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:45,970
you're a copper.

334
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,620
Little girls!

335
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,220
They have an instinct...

336
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:53,700
which they can ignore
sometimes for years because...

337
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:57,320
.. who would want to ever dig that up.

338
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:01,100
But then one day, I guess
it just gets too much.

339
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:07,420
And maybe you follow him... from work...

340
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,810
.. on one of those nights

341
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:12,530
when he always said that
he had late meetings.

342
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:15,250
One of those nights when he
came home smelling of booze

343
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:18,500
and something else,
something that scared you.

344
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:22,690
And you saw where he went...

345
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:25,200
.. and then later...

346
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:28,580
.. a child coming out with him.

347
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:35,060
No.

348
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:37,680
And you were disgusted, of course.

349
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,980
And you fought with him,

350
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:43,560
and you took that child
back to her residential home.

351
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,460
It's a nice theory...

352
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:51,490
.. but that is all it is, DS Khan.

353
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:53,740
You know that, I know that.

354
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,700
Except we have a witness...

355
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:06,620
.. who says she remembers
being driven home by a woman

356
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:10,060
in a blue convertible Golf with red trim.

357
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,890
What car did you drive?

358
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,160
Hello.

359
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:32,320
- I'm looking for Maria Gonzalez. - Mum.

360
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,480
I'd imagine that was a very
traumatic event for you.

361
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,310
Yes.

362
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,720
Doubly so in that Mr Osbourne
was never charged with anything.

363
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,360
No.

364
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,800
If you don't mind me asking,
why didn't you call the police?

365
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:55,800
I didn't want to go through
the trauma of a rape trial.

366
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,790
Absolutely.

367
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:01,520
They are a very difficult
thing to go through.

368
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:07,720
Mrs Gonzalez, there's a couple of
things I'm still confused about.

369
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,740
Firstly, did you know Mr Osbourne was gay?

370
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,420
OK.

371
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,500
Secondly, what can you
tell me about David Walker?

372
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,710
Basically, she's now admitting

373
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,590
that Walker paid her five
grand to make it all up.

374
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,680
- Bloody hell. - Apparently,
Osbourne was a very heavy drinker,

375
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,840
which Walker knew.

376
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,470
So, Gonzalez plied him
with booze at this party,

377
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,790
and took him to the toilets
where he passed out.

378
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,630
20 minutes later, she was
found down a stairwell,

379
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,870
"distressed and partially undressed".

380
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,830
- Was she meant to go to the police?
- Absolutely.

381
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,880
Her conscience wouldn't let
her go through with it.

382
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:29,400
Yeah, that and the ten grand Klein
Egerton offered her to keep shtoom.

383
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:33,200
And did she know why
Walker asked her to do this?

384
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,920
She said all she knew was
that Walker had said,

385
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,270
"Osbourne was a nosey little fucker

386
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:42,060
who'd asked him one question too many".

387
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,320
- Hi, there.
- Jesus, Grandad.

388
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,870
Sorry, mate.

389
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,510
He's lost his wallet, I'm afraid,

390
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,190
and he wanted to walk home
but Egham's a bit of schlep,

391
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,230
- so we gave him a lift into town.
- Right.

392
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,590
He just needs a bit of a kip.

393
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,310
Is he OK? He's not in any trouble...

394
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:13,720
No, no, he's fine, but he did seem
a bit tearful on the way in but...

395
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,760
Right, yeah.

396
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,430
He lost his wife a couple of years ago...

397
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,230
and he's been finding it hard.

398
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:23,560
Sorry to hear that. I'll
leave you to it then.

399
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,720
Yes, thanks again.

400
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,590
OK, I'm gonna start, if I may, Colin,

401
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,720
- by going back to your
departure from Klein's? - Yes.

402
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,800
Can you tell me why you didn't
mention the rape allegation

403
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,080
that was made against you
the last time we spoke?

404
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,920
Well, for obvious reasons.

405
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:51,260
It's something that you're ashamed of?

406
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:55,040
It's the worst thing I've ever done.

407
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,880
It's sat with me every day for...

408
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,750
.. almost 30 years.

409
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,880
Er..... even talking about it now...

410
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,760
.. it disgusts me.

411
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,880
And what is your
recollection of the event?

412
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:19,280
I had... I have no
recollection of the event,

413
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,860
- of any of the evening.
- Because you were too drunk?

414
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:30,840
I was going through a period of
having blackouts, losing whole days.

415
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:33,390
- You were drinking that heavily?
- Sadly, yes.

416
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,840
- Did you know you were gay at
the time of the allegation? - No.

417
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:41,870
Well, maybe instinctively,
but I certainly hadn't

418
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,520
admitted it to myself.

419
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:49,880
I'm guessing that it's going
to... er... shock you...

420
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:53,040
to learn that we have evidence to suggest

421
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:56,840
that Maria Gonzalez
made up the allegation.

422
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,350
That she was paid to make it up.

423
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,520
Paid by who?

424
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:28,640
- By David Walker.
- Oh, but why? Why?

425
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,540
Well, that's what we were
hoping you could tell us.

426
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,960
- I have no idea.
- Really?

427
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,480
Well... well, erm...

428
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,400
.. like I said, I... I...

429
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:57,880
I... don't even remember meeting him.

430
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,300
Colin...

431
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,950
.. we find that hard to believe.

432
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,960
We've got photos of you with
him, your number's in his diary.

433
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:11,400
According to Maria Gonzalez, you
were asking him lots of questions

434
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:14,350
in the weeks before she did what she did.

435
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,790
So, what were you asking him?

436
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,870
I have no idea what you're talking about.

437
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:22,710
- Were you asking him
questions about his past? - No.

438
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:25,590
Were you trying to discover if
this was the same David Walker

439
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:29,960
that attended parties in the early
1980s at a house in Brentford.

440
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,230
Parties? What parties?

441
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:35,180
Parties that we think that you
also attended as a teenager.

442
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:41,520
- No. - Where we think Walker
might have sexually assaulted you.

443
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,830
I was born and raised in Scotland.

444
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,510
The first time I came to London was
when I went to university in 1985.

445
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,560
I...

446
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,720
I was 19.

447
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:01,910
- Are your parents still alive, Colin?
- Yeah. Well, my dad, yeah.

448
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:05,560
And he would corroborate that, would he?

449
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,310
Of course he would corroborate it.

450
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:12,440
Did you know a Marion Kelsey?
Maiden name -- Marion Dunphy.

451
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,230
- No.
- Or Sara Alazi.

452
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:20,640
Again, that would have been her
maiden name, she's now... Mahmoud.

453
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,150
No. I want to leave now.

454
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,430
Where have you been?

455
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,510
I've been interviewed by the police again.

456
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,950
Is everything OK?

457
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,270
Yeah, fine. Did you need me?

458
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,320
Flo had ballet, you were
meant to pick her up.

459
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,590
God, I'm sorry.

460
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,790
No, it's fine, Freya's
mum brought her home,

461
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,780
but listen, I think we need to talk, love.

462
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,190
- Mr Mahmoud?
- Yes.

463
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:14,680
I'm so sorry to disturb you, I
got your address from the mosque.

464
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:18,280
I was wondering if I could talk to
you for a few moments about Sara?

465
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:22,160
- I'm sorry, I don't wanna talk about...
- Please, please.

466
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:25,190
I found these images
on my grandson's phone

467
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,640
with jokes about Mrs Mahmoud,

468
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:30,520
and I believe that woman is my daughter.

469
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,680
- So where were you
brought up, Sara? - Hayes.

470
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,960
- With Mum and Dad?
- Yes.

471
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:41,160
And are your parents alive now?

472
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,830
No, they both died in a
car crash when I was 20.

473
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:49,040
Sara's mother died in a car
accident on Christmas Eve 1980

474
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,830
when Sara was just 12.

475
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:55,000
I'm very sorry to hear that.
But you had a happy childhood?

476
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,230
Yes, it was very happy.

477
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:59,520
Sara was completely devastated
by the loss of her mother,

478
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,540
they were very close.

479
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:04,320
Perfectly understandably...

480
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,910
.. her death made her very angry.

481
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,160
With the world, I guess...

482
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,230
.. and me, particularly.

483
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,510
- You enjoyed school?
- Yes.

484
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:17,070
She started to play truant at school,

485
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,320
to fight with her friends.

486
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:24,080
And was incredibly challenging at home,

487
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,230
refusing to abide by any rules.

488
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:29,320
- You never got in to any
kind of trouble? - No.

489
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:34,000
She started to drink and smoke,
and I think even to take drugs.

490
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,480
- No trouble outside of school?
- No.

491
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:41,160
I lost count of the number of
times the police brought her home

492
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,580
to me...

493
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,670
.. in the middle of the night.

494
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:49,040
- And when did you leave school?
- When I was 16.

495
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:52,880
By 13, she pretty much stopped
going to school altogether...

496
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:57,230
.. and very often she'd
stay out all night.

497
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:00,520
I tried to be tough, I tried to be gentle.

498
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,320
I tried everything...

499
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,550
.. until I had no idea what to do.

500
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:12,680
- Why so young? Why didn't you
do A levels? - Just didn't.

501
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,520
And then, I...

502
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:22,910
.. I did something I'll
regret till the day I die.

503
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,030
You were clearly smart.

504
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:31,400
You should have done sixth
form, gone on to university.

505
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:34,200
- What happened?
- Nothing.

506
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:39,520
And so I told her, if she couldn't
live in my house by my rules...

507
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,880
.. she had to leave.

508
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,720
When she was 13?

509
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:56,400
Of course, I never expected her

510
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:00,880
to actually do it, to leave, but she did.

511
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,270
I don't believe you, Sara.

512
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,520
I think something...

513
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,960
very bad happened to you around this time.

514
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:12,440
- No. - And I think it had something...

515
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,520
to do with this house.

516
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,960
Do you recognise it?

517
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,240
No.

518
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:32,190
This is 99 Shanklin Avenue.

519
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,710
Of course, I reported it to the police,

520
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:37,030
who were completely uninterested

521
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:40,580
and who kept saying she'd
come back when she's ready.

522
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,560
So, we looked for her.

523
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,400
Her brother had heard she had a...

524
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,800
room in a squat.

525
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:57,400
Did David Walker do
something to you here, Sara?

526
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,630
So, we looked there and then in hostels,

527
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,680
and houses with men...

528
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:09,280
.. who we heard... took
her places and used her.

529
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,270
At a gathering?

530
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,310
No.

531
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:19,120
For months, for years,
we looked for her...

532
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,270
but never found her.

533
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,110
We want to help you, Sara.

534
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:25,100
And then we just stopped hearing anything.

535
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:29,600
You don't wanna help me, you
just wanna solve your case.

536
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,080
I want a solicitor.

537
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,000
Please...

538
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:43,440
just tell her I love her.

539
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,590
I've always loved her...

540
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:52,000
.. and I'm so, so sorry for what I did.

541
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,800
Zoe.

542
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:33,310
Zoe. No, I just want to speak to Zoe.

543
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:48,820
I didn't kill that man...

544
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:52,440
.. and you must know I would
never hurt a hair on her head.

545
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:55,440
I do, 100%, but...

546
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,960
.. there's still stuff
that you're not telling me,

547
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,510
stuff you've never told me.

548
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,550
And I used to be OK with that,

549
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,840
but when it starts impacting on her,

550
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:13,480
when... when we start bringing
more chaos into her life,

551
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:17,040
I can't do that to her, not after
everything that she's been through.

552
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:24,080
And so... as deeply
painful as it would be...

553
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:27,160
I would give her up, I
would give her back...

554
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,470
.. if I thought for a
second that keeping her

555
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,990
would jeopardise her well-being.

556
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,870
If I could tell you the truth...

557
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:40,600
.. Simon... I would, but I can't.

558
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,340
So I'm gonna call Janet now...

559
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,960
.. and tell her what's been happening...

560
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,620
.. and ask for her help in
deciding what's best for Flo.

561
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:21,060
- Erm... duty solicitor's
on his way for Sara. - OK.

562
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:27,180
You definitely think she was
there, at one of these gatherings?

563
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:29,170
Ellen Price thinks she recognised her.

564
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:32,460
If you'd seen her face when I showed
her the photo of Shanklin Avenue...

565
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:38,410
Cassie Stuart.

566
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:50,820
Sara's husband's downstairs, he
says he has something I need to see.

567
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:58,100
Mr Mahmoud?

568
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:02,300
She told me that your victim
died on 8th May, 1990.

569
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:05,140
Yes.

570
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:08,700
A ticket stub to see Roma play Lazio

571
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:12,900
and a photo of her in a cafe in Rome...

572
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:17,020
.. date stamped on the 8th.

573
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:21,500
On the 9th, a train ticket to
Naples and a photo of her...

574
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:27,500
inside a bar in Naples,
date stamped on the 9th.

575
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:31,220
On the 10th, restaurant receipts
in Naples, and on the 11th,

576
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:35,060
a new inter-railing card, stamped
and dated with her photo in Naples.

577
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:42,370
I'm taking my wife home now.

578
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:05,760
I love you very much.

579
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:08,600
.. and I always will.

580
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:12,010
I've sent the boys to my brother's,

581
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:14,660
there's some stuff you need to know.

582
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:17,010
We had a visitor today.

583
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:31,940
OK, I now officially give up.

584
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:39,210
And a glass of Malbec.

585
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:40,770
No, no, no, I'm here, I'm here.

586
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:43,490
- Has he come out of his room?
- No.

587
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:46,690
The bloke didn't clobber
him or anything, did he?

588
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:48,970
No, but I can't imagine it went well.

589
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:50,810
Unless he got pissed before the event,

590
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:52,330
which is always a possibility.

591
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:56,100
Yeah, OK. Erm... look,
I'm gonna be a while.

592
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:58,570
I'll be back about 10:30, 11:00.

593
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:01,090
Cool, I'll take him up some grub in a bit.

594
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:02,980
OK. Love you.

595
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:08,170
Erm... can I get a large vodka with that?

596
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:29,500
I said I needed to be on my
own, pulled my cancer-kid face.

597
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:32,650
Erm...

598
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:35,660
It's er... It seems...

599
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:39,540
.. unbelievably selfish erm...

600
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:42,780
that I'm saying this to you
of all people, but erm...

601
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:45,610
I just really want you
to understand two things.

602
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:50,500
Firstly, erm... I have some
serious crap in my life

603
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:53,130
which makes me... has always made me

604
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:54,890
hurt the people I'm closest to.

605
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:57,290
It makes me push them
away whenever I get scared

606
00:39:57,340 --> 00:40:00,420
that they might see something
that, yeah, I didn't want them to.

607
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,260
And I'm...

608
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:07,810
.. I'm so sorry that I did that
to you cos you didn't deserve it.

609
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:11,260
And the second thing I
wanted to say was that erm...

610
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:14,930
.. if I'd ever had a daughter,

611
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:17,170
I would have wanted her
to be just like you

612
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:19,820
because... I think you're smashing.

613
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:48,410
It's like all the key pieces
of an investigation are there

614
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:50,980
but nothing, nothing...

615
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:52,250
quite fits.

616
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:53,690
Sara...

617
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:56,090
- had the motive but not
the opportunity. - Yeah.

618
00:40:56,140 --> 00:41:00,260
- Marion had the opportunity
but no obvious motive. - Hm.

619
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:05,660
Colin is clearly somehow
connected to him, but just...

620
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:09,610
.. join the suspects up, I'm sure that...

621
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:13,360
Do you know what, can we just
talk about something else?

622
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:17,100
Yeah. What do you wanna talk about?

623
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:23,700
How was your date?

624
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,600
- Tell me, how was it?
- No...

625
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,020
Hi.

626
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:38,420
I know what you did, Tony.

627
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:43,060
- What did I do? - They're
yours, I know, I've always known.

628
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:46,080
- What are mine?
- Ned and Jack. Come on.

629
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:49,530
I'm the father of your sister's children?

630
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:51,130
And a part of me doesn't blame you

631
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:53,170
because I know you've always wanted kids

632
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:55,690
and you've always resented
the fact that I didn't...

633
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:58,410
- Marion. - .. but I really
think you need to leave now.

634
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:02,300
Yeah, I really think it's time.
We're done now. We're done now.

635
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:11,740
I'm gonna call your mum and Elise

636
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,850
and ask them to come and look after you.

637
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:16,570
Get you the right help, get
you back on some meds maybe.

638
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:19,700
And you know, I actually think
you're right asking me to leave.

639
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:27,260
I don't think I'm good
for you any more, Maz.

640
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:29,680
I want too much from you.

641
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:32,400
Things you can't give me.

642
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:39,330
You know...

643
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:43,900
.. not having children...

644
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:47,540
was the hardest thing for
me, it still is some days.

645
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:50,920
But I was always completely
prepared to do that...

646
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:53,760
.. because I loved you...

647
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:57,960
.. love you.

648
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:12,320
I dunno.

649
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:16,300
Oh, it's been a few years now.

650
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:19,480
Do you know what? I just...
I just think you...

651
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:24,620
.. you sort of forget why you
might be attractive to anyone.

652
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:29,100
You... I...

653
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:31,120
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

654
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:34,220
I mean...

655
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:35,890
you know, if no-one is telling you,

656
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:39,460
you don't go around
telling yourself, do you?

657
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:44,140
Right, right, cos... that would
be a bad thing, wouldn't it?

658
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:47,540
Oh...

659
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:51,330
For what it's worth, I
think you're attractive.

660
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:53,330
- Oh, gosh, shut up now.
- No, I do.

661
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:55,730
Yes, well, that would
be because you're drunk.

662
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:58,050
No, it's because you, you...

663
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:01,930
.. because you're funny and clever...

664
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:06,050
.. and kind...

665
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:09,210
.. and pretty.

666
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:12,660
Am I? Fuck, I sound fantastic.

667
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:16,900
Well, yeah. Yeah, you are.

668
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:29,580
Oh, no. No...

669
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:32,130
Shit, sorry. No, no, I wasn't, I wasn't...

670
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:35,300
- No, absolutely. Nor was I.
- Sure.

671
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:37,740
Erm... but, Cassie, sit down.

672
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:40,010
No, I've... I've got to shoot cos erm...

673
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:43,000
- Please, sit.
- No, look, it's all good.

674
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:45,400
I'll see you tomorrow, Sunny.

675
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:24,140
Sunny! I need to talk you.

676
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:25,490
Boss, I'm sorry about that.

677
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:28,410
No, not about that, that was
just cripplingly embarrassing.

678
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:31,210
No, there's no reason why you
should feel in any way...

679
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:33,290
- No, not for me, for you.
- Oh, right, yeah.

680
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:35,490
- It's about the case.
- What about the case?

681
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:38,940
What you said earlier about
nothing quite fitting...

682
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:42,020
- I think I can see a
way that it does. - OK.

683
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:44,820
And if I'm right...

684
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:46,900
there are gonna be more bodies.

684
00:45:47,305 --> 00:46:47,627
