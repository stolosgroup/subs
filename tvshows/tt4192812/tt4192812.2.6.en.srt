1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,630
The gatherings were supposed
to be prayer evenings.

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:04,550
There was a woman that drove us back.

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,790
I think she was his wife or girlfriend.

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:11,150
She remembers a blue Golf
convertible. What car did you drive?

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,710
Maybe they were all at
one of these parties

6
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,630
and maybe all three
involved in his murder.

7
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,430
I don't think I'm good
for you any more, Maz.

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,710
- I didn't kill that man.
- I'm gonna call Janet now

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,270
- and ask for her help.
- 'Hi, I'm Martin.

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,670
You had sex with my wife 20 years ago.

11
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,830
Wondered if we could chat.'

12
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,550
Oh, no. No.

13
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,760
I'm pretty certain she was
at the party. I recognise her.

14
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,670
Men took her places and used her.

15
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:41,270
- Did David Walker do something
to you here, Sara? - No.

16
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,710
What you said earlier about
nothing quite fitting --

17
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,260
If I'm right, there are
gonna be more bodies.

So...

29
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,440
what did he tell you, my dad?

30
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,390
Enough for me to know if you...
never wanna talk about this again,

31
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,440
and that's fine.

32
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:54,310
Or if you wanna talk about it every
day for the rest of your life,

33
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,360
that's fine, too.

34
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,000
- I'm doing it properly.
- I know. I see you are.

35
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,310
He was just very shocked
when I introduced myself.

36
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,360
And scared.

37
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,710
He was babbling and...

38
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,760
kept repeating that it...
didn't mean anything.

39
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,630
He kept on apologising.

40
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,870
But I wasn't interested in apologies.

41
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,920
I didn't want contrition.
What I wanted was...

42
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,080
.. to understand.

43
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,700
And the only person who
could help me do that...

44
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,960
.. was dead.

45
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,870
Does it ever cross your mind, Cath,

46
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,920
that we've a very limited pot of money?

47
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,870
And if we spend too much
on an incredibly expensive

48
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,350
and time-consuming investigation
into 40-year-old abuse,

49
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,840
then we've got nothing to spend on
a child that got abused last week.

50
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,360
Yes, of course.

51
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,360
And?

52
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,350
Would you like to come through?

53
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:59,270
And in terms of the bigger investigation,

54
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,550
the murder investigation,
where are you with that?

55
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,590
Don't know.

56
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:07,390
They questioned me again yesterday,
but I have a watertight alibi.

57
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:11,030
And this was that you were
sectioned in the Maudsley?

58
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,070
26 years ago, yes.

59
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,640
And for what it's worth, I
did not kill David Walker.

60
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,590
OK.

61
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,110
Well, I just hope I
have all the facts now.

62
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:27,310
- I just need to consider how
best to proceed. - Yeah, of course.

63
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,350
- How long do you think it will be?
- I don't know!

64
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,830
I've never had to deal with
anything remotely like this.

65
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:35,870
Sorry for snapping, but I'm...
I'm cross and disappointed.

66
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,920
And Flo?

67
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,470
- Erm... Simon, could you pick
her up from school today? - Yeah.

68
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,510
OK, thank you. And Colin,
until I decide what to do,

69
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,230
I need you to find somewhere
else to stay, please.

70
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,270
Sure, sure.

71
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:59,430
And if the investigation goes away,
then maybe we can get through this.

72
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,710
If it drags on, if, God forbid,

73
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,760
you were charged and it went to trial...

74
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,230
we could obviously never
let you parent Flo.

75
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,350
You'd either have to move our permanently

76
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:13,630
and... we'd have to consider
Simon as a single parent,

77
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,350
or if you both felt you couldn't do that,

78
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,070
then we'd have to take her back.

79
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,630
You know I would actually
get the boy's DNA tested

80
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,630
if I thought it would help you,
but I know you know it's nonsense.

81
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,030
You just wanted him gone,

82
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,830
like me and Mum,

83
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,710
so that he couldn't ask you any more
questions you didn't want to answer.

84
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:40,080
But Mum and I are not going anywhere.

85
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,120
I'm sorry.

86
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:48,180
Anyway, come on. Do you
want another cup of tea?

87
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:00,520
So, for over two weeks now, we've
all wrestled with this case.

88
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,510
Following one... dead end after another.

89
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,150
With the final nail in the coffin

90
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:11,750
of the idea of Sara Mahmoud's
possible guilt... coming last night

91
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:16,360
when her husband turned up
out of the blue with this.

92
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:21,750
Evidence she was in Italy at
the time of Walker's death,

93
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,590
which er.. was a blow

94
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26,710
because we know that Sara knew Walker.

95
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,430
And I reckon if we hunted hard enough,

96
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:33,270
we could conclusively place her
at a gathering Walker was at.

97
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,230
Given also we know what Walker
liked to do to young girls,

98
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:40,150
when he turns up at her flat
as a client eight years later,

99
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,270
she has the perfect motive
for a revenge murder.

100
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,990
Except the alibi is good.

101
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:48,070
More than good. It's watertight.

102
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,220
There's no way she could have killed him.

103
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,470
Question is...

104
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,910
is it too good?

105
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,670
What, you think it's faked somehow?

106
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,030
No. I think it's real.

107
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,710
But what it feels like to me

108
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:06,710
is a bunch of information
collected by a woman

109
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,550
who knew she'd NEED an alibi.

110
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,600
Which would mean...

111
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:15,350
.. she'd have had to know
that Walker was going to die.

112
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,400
Yes.

113
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,350
OK, here goes.

114
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,160
And erm...

115
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:27,120
.. stop me when it gets too mental.

116
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,750
So, we have three suspects

117
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,070
who actually all have dysfunction
consistent with abusive childhoods.

118
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,750
Er... drink issues, mental health
issues, relationship issues.

119
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:44,670
We have three people who, for my money,

120
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,840
just tried too hard to look
like they didn't know each other.

121
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,070
And then we have an idea.

122
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,470
That Sara Mahmoud was
abused by David Walker,

123
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:59,030
but that Colin and Marion

124
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:02,440
were abused by people
we've not yet identified.

125
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,750
And that, at some point in early 1990,

126
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,030
after Sara realises a client
is the same man who'd raped her

127
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,070
at a gathering eight years before,

128
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:16,830
three of them... already, I
believe, known to each other somehow,

129
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:20,040
came together and hatched a plan...

130
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,590
to murder all three of their abusers.

131
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,710
Now, they knew if they
murdered their own abuser,

132
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:29,600
there'd almost certainly be an
easily traceable link back to them.

133
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,030
So they agreed to kill each other's.

134
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,550
Sorry, Gov, if I'm being dim here,

135
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:42,110
but erm... if you've
created the perfect alibi,

136
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:45,110
why did Sara wait two weeks
before she gave it to us?

137
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:48,630
Cos offering it up immediately
could also arouse suspicion.

138
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,630
How much more credible for
her husband to find it.

139
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,390
And you think Walker was the first victim?

140
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,070
I think him turning up
as a punter at Sara's flat

141
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,070
- was what kicked it all off.
- And he was killed by...?

142
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,230
- Has to be Marion. Isn't it?
- I think so.

143
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,510
Osborne was in the Maudsley,
Sara was in Italy.

144
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,190
And Walker's body was
found less than eight miles

145
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,190
from Marion's parents' house.

146
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,190
So, why did Osborne spend so
much time with Walker, then?

147
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,310
I think he was trying to confirm
that Walker was who Sara thought.

148
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:23,270
So that has to mean Tara would have
had to kill... Colin Osborne's abuser

149
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,870
and Osborne Marian's.

150
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,120
Yes.

151
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,430
And if we're right...

152
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,670
.. to prove this theory, we'd
need to find three things.

153
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,910
We'd need to find... evidence
of that historic connection,

154
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:44,920
we'd need to find evidence of who
those other abusers might have been.

155
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,180
And we'd need to find two more bodies.

156
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,720
It won't be forever. It's fine.

157
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,150
Give her a big kiss from me.

158
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,920
Tell her I love her and
I'll be back very soon.

159
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,190
Murray and Jake, we need to find out

160
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,910
where our three suspects might have met.

161
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:29,510
We know that two of them weren't
even in London till 1985,

162
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,310
so we're looking at a meeting

163
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,270
that happened somewhere
between then and 1990.

164
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,830
Where might have that occurred?

165
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,990
Was it through a job, party,
flat share, group counselling?

166
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,270
I dunno. Think laterally. We'll be
focusing on the suspects' families.

167
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,430
DCI Stuart will go to Glasgow to
talk to Colin Osborne's father,

168
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,350
Fran will visit Sara Mahmoud's husband,

169
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,430
- I'll visit Marion Kelsey's sister.
- We don't think they'll know a lot

170
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,550
about what's been going
on the last few weeks,

171
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,150
and if our suspects were abused,

172
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,270
their families are our most
likely source of information.

173
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,260
And how much do we actually tell them?

174
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,950
We stop short of actually lying,

175
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,750
but not by much, or we'll get nothing.

176
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,190
We don't need these
interviews to be admissible.

177
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:14,390
Right now, we just need to know
that we're on the right lines.

178
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:18,120
So no appointments, no
warnings we're coming.

179
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:22,080
We need to catch them on the back foot.

180
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,720
- You don't need to say anything.
- Look, I...

181
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,950
I just hope this doesn't affect
our work or our friendship.

182
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,160
It won't. It hasn't, all right? I promise.

183
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,790
Now piss off.

184
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,590
They're trying to trace more
of the victims of the activities

185
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,710
inside this Brentford
house, and if they do,

186
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,590
they think they could support
the allegation you were present

187
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,630
on at least one occasion.

188
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,990
You're gonna be suspended from all duties

189
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,910
whilst a full investigation takes place.

190
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,920
I have to ask...

191
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,750
.. if you did know what he was doing,

192
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,740
how could you have not said anything?

193
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:00,100
It sounds so inadequate, doesn't it...

194
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,710
.. when you hear it on the news?

195
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,760
People saying they were different times.

196
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,070
But they were.

197
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,390
There were times when a rock
star could... go on telly

198
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,790
and be interviewed about
his underage girlfriend

199
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,110
and no-one got arrested.

200
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,400
We all just... shrugged it off.

201
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:29,430
We thought it was sort
of... cheeky and amusing.

202
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:33,960
We all bought into that, until we didn't.

203
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,070
So that time, I followed him.

204
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,030
And it was just the once.

205
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,860
He told me she was 16.

206
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,440
And willing.

207
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,150
And he begged me to forgive him.

208
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,440
And I wanted to.

209
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,310
Both...

210
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,080
forgive him and believe him.

211
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:23,280
Because otherwise, it was
the end of our marriage...

212
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:28,180
.. and everything we'd built up together.

213
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,080
And so I did.

214
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,760
And for that...

215
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,740
.. I am truly ashamed.

216
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:05,110
Well, Colin was a lively lad, you
know, when he was a little boy.

217
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:08,270
He was full of mischief and fun.

218
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,400
And then when he was about...

219
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,390
.. nine...

220
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,310
he just slowly started to change.

221
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,950
Became quieter, you
know, more introverted.

222
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,390
Staying in his room more,
not seeing his pals so much.

223
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:32,790
And his... schoolwork suffered

224
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:37,830
and he stopped being affectionate.
Got angry at the slightest thing

225
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,950
and erm... he just...

226
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,550
.. became a different child.

227
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,350
And I presume you asked
him what was wrong?

228
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,670
Over and over, for years.

229
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:54,750
He would always just
say, 'Nothing. I'm fine.'

230
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,790
So in the end, we just thought,
'Well, that's how he is.'

231
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,110
That's how he was.

232
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,150
That er...

233
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,200
children change.

234
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:09,430
And what you're talking
about -- sexual abuse --

235
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,990
wasn't something that you
considered back in the '70s.

236
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:18,310
It wasn't one of the options for
why a child isn't themselves.

237
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:21,860
But if we consider it
as a possibility now...

238
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:26,270
.. do you have any idea
where something like that

239
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,030
could have happened to Colin?

240
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:31,200
Were there ever any issues
in his primary school?

241
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,710
No, I never heard of
anything like that there.

242
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,350
Any friends or family?

243
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,150
No.

244
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,940
Was he a member of a church or...

245
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:47,840
.. a football team or scout group or...?

246
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,280
Mr Osborne.

247
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,800
There was one bloke, a
pal from work, Len Paxton.

248
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:08,280
He ran the local platoon
of... Club Rangers.

249
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:20,470
I don't know why she seems
to hate me or hate our mum.

250
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,950
Like I said, she's troubled.

251
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,870
- Was it always like that?
- Absolutely not, no.

252
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,430
We adored each other
when we were growing up.

253
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,710
Do you remember when it
changed? Was it overnight or...?

254
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,390
No, I remember exactly when it changed.

255
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,310
I was 14

256
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,350
and Marion was 11

257
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,230
and we'd moved to Cork.

258
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,830
Our dad had got a job as a lecturer there.

259
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,150
You know, we had a great
house, a lovely garden.

260
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,700
We even got our own
rooms for the first time.

261
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:55,310
But Marion just... seemed to hate it.

262
00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:00,790
Overnight, she became...
distant, sullen, aggressive.

263
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,670
- Towards you?
- Towards me, towards our mum,

264
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:07,120
- at school, everyone.
- Including your dad?

265
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:10,480
Actually, no, not Dad.

266
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,590
But then, him and Marion
were always stupidly close.

267
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,710
So, no, dad was the only
one who escaped her ire.

268
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,630
When did your dad pass away?

269
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,990
1991.

270
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,480
- How old was he?
- 57.

271
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,740
That sounds pretty young. Was he ill?

272
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:35,880
- Why do you ask?
- Just trying to fill in the gaps.

273
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,600
Well, no, he wasn't ill.
Well, not physically, anyway.

274
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,110
He erm... took his own life.

275
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,270
I'm sorry to hear that.

276
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,590
Do you mind if I ask how?

277
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,190
He hanged himself.

278
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,070
Highgate woods.

279
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:59,200
So did he have a history of
depression or mental illness or...?

280
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,710
What are you suggesting?

281
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,790
Did he?

282
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,800
No.

283
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,600
Right.

284
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,820
Do you know if your mum's at home?

285
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:22,090
Paxton? Don't recall the name Paxton.

286
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:23,850
Before my time, probably.

287
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,900
Really?

288
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:30,130
- Sorry?
- Well, it's just erm...

289
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:34,260
Well, I found him with a
simple Google search so...

290
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,640
What are you asking me
about him for, then?

291
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:42,970
Because I wanna know what happened
to him after he left prison in 1988

292
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:46,370
for assaulting two boys
from a platoon in Dumfries.

293
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:50,380
Look, this is all ancient history.

294
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:56,370
Do you know, I am getting... really
pissed off with that expression

295
00:19:56,420 --> 00:20:00,330
because it's just not. The sort of
things people like Len Paxton did

296
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:03,130
are still affecting people
today, catastrophically.

297
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:08,210
It... fucks up whole lives, OK?

298
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:11,130
So unless you want me to come back tonight

299
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:13,210
when all the parents are here,

300
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:17,860
I'd start trying a little harder
to remember, if I were you.

301
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:22,020
He's dead.

302
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:26,060
When?

303
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:29,660
'92.

304
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:33,010
How?

305
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:36,000
He topped himself, everyone reckoned.

306
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:40,010
- Reckoned?
- He had this little yacht

307
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:42,530
he used to take some of the lads out on.

308
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:44,850
It was found a few days
after he went missing,

309
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:47,650
drifting in open water
off Greenock harbour.

310
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,040
They never found his body.

311
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:53,940
Although I'm not sure
anyone looked too hard.

312
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:02,980
It's changed. We've changed.

313
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,690
People like him don't slip
through the nets any more.

314
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:08,970
Well, I really hope so.

315
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:13,370
But they were saying that 30
years ago, and 20 and ten,

316
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:17,570
and I just... fucking pray that they
won't be saying it 20 years from now

317
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:19,620
about today.

318
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:30,930
Her father told me what he'd found out

319
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:34,980
- in the months after she ran away.
- This was while she was still 13?

320
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:39,330
Them being taken to parties
organised by men like Walker

321
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:41,650
and raped.

322
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,650
Did he... not report this?

323
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,690
Did he not go to the police?

324
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:51,010
Yes. Apparently your lot told
him you couldn't do anything

325
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:54,810
because it had been her choice
to become a child prostitute --

326
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:58,660
a phrase it should be
fucking illegal to even use.

327
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:09,700
Jesus.

328
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:13,370
You knew.

329
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:15,410
No.

330
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:18,130
She told you. You knew!

331
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:20,180
I did not know!

332
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:27,050
She was always making things up,
Elise, exaggerating everything.

333
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:29,610
Your father would never
have done the things --

334
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:32,620
How old was she when she told you?

335
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,490
You tell me now or I swear I'll...!

336
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:39,100
Elise.

337
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:44,060
- 12.
- Oh, my...!

338
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:53,650
And you decided not to believe her

339
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:57,010
because, what, you didn't
wanna lose the house

340
00:22:57,060 --> 00:23:01,290
or the research trips
abroad? Or because what?!

341
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:04,580
You're a evil fucking witch!

342
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:14,620
We... we have wondered all
our lives why she is so angry.

343
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:37,260
I need you to tell me exactly
what Marion told you.

344
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:40,340
Please.

345
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:46,850
- What sort of a mother does that?
- I'm struggling to be charitable.

346
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:49,330
Well, Osborne's dad clearly had no idea.

347
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:52,690
Nor did Marion's sister. I guess
we've lost our element of surprise.

348
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:55,930
- Pretty sure all three will know the
questions we've been asking. - Yeah.

349
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:58,570
Which is why I wanna get in
front of Colin and Marion today

350
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:01,090
- while they're still on the back foot.
- And ask them what?

351
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:03,050
'Where they were when own abusers died.'

352
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:06,490
Because if we're right, they'll
have absolutely watertight alibis.

353
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:10,140
Which both proves the theory and
sort of screws us, evidentially.

354
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:12,650
What have we got from Murray?

355
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:17,050
So, he's spent all day
trawling NHS records.

356
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:22,610
Turns out that at various
points in '87 and early 1988,

357
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:24,850
both Colin and Sara were under the care

358
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:27,900
of the Ealing Hospital psychiatric unit.

359
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:31,450
- As inpatients? - Yeah.
- 'What about Marion?'

360
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:34,650
'We haven't located her records
yet. But here's a thing.

361
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,850
Before she lived at her Smoke Lane flat,

362
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:42,260
from early '86 to late '87, she
lived in a flat in South Ealing.

363
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:49,010
So that's the link. They met
in Ealing psychiatric unit.

364
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:53,660
Well, it's gonna be hard to prove,
but it's got to be a possibility.

365
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:58,500
Yeah.

366
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,170
You track down Colin,
I'll speak to Marion.

367
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:04,220
Thanks, Sunny.

368
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:09,410
'The train now approaching
platform four will not stop here.'

369
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:12,250
'Stand back from the
edge of platform four.'

370
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:15,500
'The next train is not scheduled to stop.'

371
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,240
Jason!

372
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,740
How are you doing?

373
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:35,140
Fancy a cuppa?

374
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:02,890
Look... I know it's really annoying

375
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:05,730
when people give you trite bits
of advice on how to be happy,

376
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:09,930
but... you don't have to
be defined by your past.

377
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:13,090
I had a horrible relationship
split a couple of years ago,

378
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:15,980
then my mum died, and then my cat.

379
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:21,290
And I was really struggling,
and then I met this bloke

380
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:26,450
and I thought, 'God, he's nice.
He's not like other blokes.

381
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,530
I'd love to get to know him better.'

382
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:33,530
And it showed me that there
was possibility ahead.

383
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:36,490
- Do you see?
- Yeah.

384
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:38,620
Life goes on, Jase.

385
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:44,850
Right, yeah, well, thanks for
that. And good luck with the bloke.

386
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:47,620
Jase, the bloke's you.

387
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:52,860
- What?
- It's you.

388
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:56,530
I like you.

389
00:26:56,580 --> 00:27:00,090
- Really?
- Don't act so surprised.

390
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:02,140
It's just erm...

391
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,930
.. no-one's ever said that to me.

392
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:08,770
So what I wanted to say was,

393
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:11,690
shall we get that date in the diary?

394
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,770
Marion, please don't go out now.

395
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:25,330
I'm fine, honestly. Please don't
say anything to Tony just yet

396
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:29,020
cos I need to speak to him myself.
OK? Back in a couple of hours.

397
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:32,810
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

398
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:36,100
And I am so, so sorry.

399
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:07,290
- Sunny.
- Gov, Colin's not at his house.

400
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:09,290
His husband said he'd moved out for a bit

401
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:12,370
and was staying at a Holiday
Inn, but he's not there either.

402
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:15,360
- 'Right.'
- Are you at Marion's yet?

403
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:17,560
Er... no, no, not yet.

404
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:21,100
I'll call you.

405
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:34,770
They have no proof of anything,
Marion, and they never will have.

406
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:36,410
But they know.

407
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:38,530
But knowing something
and proving it in court

408
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:41,120
are two very different things.

409
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:47,380
Yeah, they are...

410
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,560
.. very different.

411
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:56,370
Marion.

412
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:58,930
Where are you running to? It's over.

413
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:01,210
So I wanna speak to my husband now, OK?

414
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:04,180
Now I want to explain.

415
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:12,930
Well, I was in Goa when
Paxton went missing.

416
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:16,330
I have hotel and flight receipts.
I can prove I wasn't here.

417
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:20,930
I'm sure. And when Marion's father died,

418
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:24,380
can you prove you weren't
in Highgate woods?

419
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:28,930
And did you meet them both
in Ealing psychiatric unit

420
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:32,180
or... just Sara?

421
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,650
I've read er...

422
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:46,970
people... who've been abused

423
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:49,820
can always recognise other victims.

424
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:53,570
Something in the way
they carry themselves.

425
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:55,620
Was it that...

426
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:59,660
.. that drew you to each other?

427
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,770
So I guess now you...

428
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,770
.. pull what you have together

429
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:11,250
and...

430
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:13,410
present it to the CPS

431
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:16,090
and... they may go for it

432
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:18,880
and you may be able to charge us.

433
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:24,850
But before you do, maybe I could
just give you some other facts.

434
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:27,300
Please do.

435
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:30,940
So...

436
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:38,410
.. he used to come round to our
house on Sunday nights... mainly,

437
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:41,250
for a roast dinner

438
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:44,210
and he'd always find time to play with me.

439
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:46,490
He'd pretend to be a horse

440
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:49,770
and I'd climb on his back and
he'd buck and twist and turn,

441
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:53,050
and I was a cowboy at a
bucking bronco contest,

442
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:57,530
and I fucking loved him.
And when my dad found out

443
00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:00,850
that he ran the local Club Rangers platoon

444
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:04,380
and suggested that I join,
I could not be happier.

445
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:07,930
And for six months, it was
the best time of my life.

446
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:12,010
We played football and kicked the
can and made fires in the woods

447
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:13,730
and bows and arrows.

448
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:15,770
It was...

449
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:18,260
Enid Blyton for real.

450
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:24,290
The first time it happened was when
we went camping for the weekend.

451
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:28,770
My tent was an old army
one of my grandad's

452
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:32,490
and when we started to put it up,
he said it wouldn't be any good

453
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:36,260
because it wasn't waterproof
anymore and it was gonna rain.

454
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:40,860
But that was OK, he said,
because he had room in his tent.

455
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:45,170
That night, he only gave me a massage

456
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:47,690
to help with the day's hike.

457
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:53,460
The next night, he touched
me and asked me to touch him.

458
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:57,520
It didn't rain that night either.

459
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:03,580
I've spent a lifetime talking
to you about the shame and...

460
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:07,210
.. guilt

461
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:10,970
and how I thought I must have
actually wanted him to do it

462
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:13,890
because sometimes I got an erection.

463
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:17,570
And how I couldn't tell mum and
dad because he was their friend

464
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:21,890
and I didn't wanna upset
them or embarrass anyone.

465
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:23,570
And how I couldn't tell anyone else

466
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:26,820
because he said I'd be sent away if I did.

467
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:31,570
But I do still ask
myself every single day,

468
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:34,090
'Why didn't I tell someone?'

469
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:40,810
Then over the next...

470
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:44,290
.. six months,

471
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:47,980
on visits to our house
when my parents were out...

472
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:52,090
.. he did... he did things...

473
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:59,740
.. which actually physically
damaged me for life.

474
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:03,650
Because a 48-year-old man

475
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:07,900
is not meant to put himself
inside a nine-year-old boy.

476
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:11,570
But much worse than the physical damage

477
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:14,620
is the damage he did to me as a person.

478
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:20,340
Because that first time, he
changed me instantly and forever.

479
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:25,250
The drinking, the... rage,

480
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:29,210
the suicide attempts, the
fighting, the manic working,

481
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:31,410
the...

482
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:35,890
endless, exhausting, visceral rage

483
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:38,210
that I feel every day of my life,

484
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:43,160
that I feel right at this moment,
having to explain this to you.

485
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,900
That is all because of him.

486
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:53,090
So you might put me in prison,

487
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:55,330
but let me tell you this.

488
00:34:55,380 --> 00:35:00,340
You can't judge me unless
you've had it done to you.

489
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:07,340
I won't ever, ever let anyone
judge me for what I did.

490
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:26,250
And... and just so as you know,
what happened to Sara and Marion

491
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:28,220
was much worse.

492
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:00,210
Hiya.

493
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:02,140
You OK?

494
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:11,180
I need to tell you something.

495
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:30,610
For a while, I wondered if
he only took the job in Cork

496
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:33,090
because of the house,

497
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:36,260
which meant that Elise and I
had our own rooms finally.

498
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:42,650
First time, my mum was just downstairs.

499
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:47,820
She was watching the Onedin Line
-- I... could hear the theme music.

500
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:51,970
And he came in when my lights were out

501
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:53,810
and he knelt by my bedside

502
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:57,850
and he said that I was growing up now,

503
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:00,130
becoming a young woman,

504
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:02,810
and that soon I'd have boyfriends

505
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:05,960
and he wanted me to be prepared for that.

506
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:11,060
He wanted to help me, so
I knew how to enjoy it.

507
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:16,900
And then he put his hand
under the covers and...

508
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:21,490
.. he did what a boyfriend might do.

509
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:25,850
And he did that pretty
much... every Saturday night

510
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:28,700
when he was home, for about a year.

511
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:33,300
And then one day, when
I was having my tea...

512
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:38,450
I finally told my mum...
that he did things to me

513
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,490
while she was downstairs.

514
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:44,130
And I remember she was
peeling potatoes at the sink

515
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:47,130
and... she never even stopped.

516
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:50,610
She never turned to me,
she never said anything.

517
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:55,050
And five minutes later, she
told me to go back upstairs

518
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:57,090
and finish my homework.

519
00:37:57,140 --> 00:38:00,170
And I wondered at first if
she hadn't been listening,

520
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:03,370
but then that night, she came upstairs

521
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:06,090
and she stayed there, folding clothes

522
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:10,660
and tidying... for an
hour after I went to bed.

523
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:13,930
And...

524
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:16,170
of course, he never came near me.

525
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:18,250
And she did that for about six months

526
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:21,100
and then one day, she just stopped.

527
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:24,810
And then when she and my sister

528
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:28,100
were out at the cinema
a few weeks later...

529
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:32,160
.. he raped me for the first time.

530
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:36,210
And I remember, I said to him erm...

531
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:41,370
.. if he did the same to Elise and
he said, 'No, no.' It was just me.

532
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:43,420
Cos I was special.

533
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:48,420
I was special.

534
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:55,370
And the anger, Tony, the anger
I felt for so many years,

535
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:57,420
and I still do....

536
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:05,440
In the end, it made me
do a terrible thing.

537
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,220
Hey.

538
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:33,900
Hiya.

539
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:37,860
How are you?

540
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:41,730
He sent me that.

541
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:44,730
- Who did?
- Him.

542
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:46,410
Your mother's lover.

543
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:50,300
It's the letter she wrote, telling
him why she was finishing with him.

544
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:55,340
How she realised that what
we had was what she wanted.

545
00:39:56,660 --> 00:40:00,160
How terrible she felt
about what she'd done...

546
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:06,940
.. and how the affair made her
realise how much she loved me.

547
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:15,060
It's a good letter...
to read, Cass, for me.

548
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:19,690
It's very good for me to know about.

549
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:22,140
Mm.

550
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:35,900
You wouldn't have got it if you
hadn't gone to see him, Dad.

551
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:43,540
So you were right. You.

552
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:01,900
Listen, I've just gotta make a quick call.

553
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:05,090
I love you, Dad.

554
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:06,860
Just er...

555
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:10,370
.. I'll be quick.

556
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:28,020
- 'Sunny?'
- Hey.

557
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:32,380
Can you meet me?

558
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:36,930
This case rests on them
knowing each other.

559
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:39,850
Without conclusive proof
of that, it is just a theory

560
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:41,810
and they're not gonna confess.

561
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:44,930
Without any bodies, it's
gonna be... very hard

562
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:47,920
to connect any of them to the deaths.

563
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:52,010
So I can't see the CPS being
delirious to press charges.

564
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:54,050
But we do have proof now.

565
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:57,530
I mean, you just told me
you saw them together.

566
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:59,580
I saw them...

567
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:02,970
.. on my own.

568
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:05,460
CCTV or...?

569
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:09,650
And they arrived separately.

570
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:12,290
Fuck.

571
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:14,820
'Yeah, fuck.'

572
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:21,860
'Well...'

573
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:26,970
.. I guess in the end, you have
to ask yourself the old question.

574
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:29,690
Why do we send people to prison?

575
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:34,140
And do Colin, Sara and Marion...

576
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:40,970
.. need to be deterred from
committing murder again?

577
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:43,980
- No.
- No, I don't think so.

578
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:48,370
So...

579
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:50,530
do they need to be rehabilitated?

580
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:53,330
I mean, for the last 20 years at least,

581
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:57,250
they've all been very
valuable members of society.

582
00:42:57,300 --> 00:43:00,620
All three of them helping
the most vulnerable.

583
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:05,500
'Which means...

584
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:10,500
.. in the end, it pretty much
comes down to punishment.

585
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:14,170
Do Colin, Sara and Marion
need to be punished?'

586
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:18,010
'And that's it, you see, because for me,

587
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:21,210
I think their whole
lives have been one long,

588
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:23,650
indescribably brutal punishment,

589
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:28,020
and I just can't see why we
would punish them further.

590
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:32,340
I can't see who would benefit.'

591
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:37,530
No, no, nor can I.

592
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:39,730
OK.

593
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:41,780
So...

594
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:47,810
.. this is... significant.

595
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:51,370
Sunny, this is a pretty fucking
huge thing I would do here.

596
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:53,850
- You?
- Yeah.

597
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:55,690
To be absolutely clear, this is just me.

598
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:58,170
You would never be implicated
in any decision I make.

599
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:01,210
But if you have a single shred
of doubt, please tell me now.

600
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:03,770
Tell me to see Andrews first
thing tomorrow morning,

601
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:07,820
report everything, tell him
I saw them all together.

602
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:23,980
I don't believe they could be charged...

603
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:27,530
.. and I see no point in
disrupting their lives further,

604
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:30,090
so... no,

605
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:33,540
I won't tell you to do that.

606
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:44,370
You're all right.

607
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:46,290
Do you know that?

608
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:49,860
You're not so bad yourself.

609
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:55,770
I'm gonna leave now before
you try and snog me.

610
00:44:55,820 --> 00:44:57,900
Smart move.

611
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:11,730
Na-night, Sunny.

612
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:13,660
Night, Gov.

612
00:45:14,305 --> 00:46:14,915
