1
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,075
There is some evidence to suggest
that Hayley was strangled.

2
00:00:11,075 --> 00:00:12,977
DCI Stuart,
Hayley was a friend of mine.

3
00:00:12,986 --> 00:00:15,315
I was supposed to be doing
a cleaning job,

4
00:00:15,324 --> 00:00:17,137
Hayley did the job for me.

5
00:00:17,137 --> 00:00:18,462
It was in a holiday rental.

6
00:00:18,462 --> 00:00:20,373
I'd forgotten
that's who we let it to.

7
00:00:20,382 --> 00:00:23,102
He does that quiz show on the BBC.
James Hollis.

8
00:00:23,102 --> 00:00:25,324
Just give me ten minutes,
I'm not feeling 100%.

9
00:00:25,324 --> 00:00:27,000
Dad, this is not about the past.

10
00:00:27,004 --> 00:00:29,000
Or, at least, not the past
you're talking about.

11
00:00:29,022 --> 00:00:30,160
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

12
00:00:30,168 --> 00:00:32,577
Tim, it's your word against hers.

13
00:00:32,586 --> 00:00:35,475
I pretended to go out.
I just heard him go for her.

14
00:00:35,484 --> 00:00:37,377
I don't believe
I ever lost my temper.

15
00:00:37,377 --> 00:00:39,324
I'd really appreciate
having somebody here.

16
00:00:39,324 --> 00:00:41,448
They took money
I had for a deposit on a flat.

17
00:00:41,448 --> 00:00:43,884
I do think you should consider
opening a bank account.

18
00:00:43,884 --> 00:00:45,960
No. No. No. No. No bank accounts.

19
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,551
I would feel very lucky to be able
to help you grow stronger.

20
00:00:48,577 --> 00:00:50,488
There'll be money
in the joint account tomorrow.

21
00:00:50,497 --> 00:00:54,364
Mr Carr sold my father a cash ISA.
We want to cancel it.

22
00:00:54,364 --> 00:00:55,960
I can't see any paperwork here.

23
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,155
Mr Hollis, we wondered
if you had five minutes, please,

24
00:00:59,155 --> 00:01:00,791
to help us with a case
we're investigating.

25
00:01:00,791 --> 00:01:02,160
I will need my lawyer present.

26
00:01:02,168 --> 00:01:03,742
Els, it's Dad again.

27
00:01:03,742 --> 00:01:05,960
They've come about her.

28
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,074

29
00:01:55,733 --> 00:01:57,960
Oh, shit!

30
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,542
Oh, you...

31
00:02:03,768 --> 00:02:05,960
Dad!

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,960
- Dad!
- Yes?

33
00:02:11,733 --> 00:02:13,640
Morning.

34
00:02:13,768 --> 00:02:17,431
- Blimey! Are you all right?
- You left a pan on.

35
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,560
Me? No.

36
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,560
Yeah, I walked in
and it was burning.

37
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,560
Is that your porridge?

38
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,560
This was off when I left.

39
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,866
Right. Well, I've, like,
literally just walked in.

40
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:30,920
So.

41
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,991
Well, it's still under warranty.
I'll get in touch with the company.

42
00:02:40,773 --> 00:02:44,480
I'm sorry. If I knew anything,
I'd tell you, Mr Hollis.

43
00:02:44,488 --> 00:02:46,728
- You know I would.
- I do. But if you do hear anything,

44
00:02:46,728 --> 00:02:48,053
tell him I need to speak to him.

45
00:02:48,062 --> 00:02:50,000
Tell him it's really urgent.

46
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,737
And, so, in the end,

47
00:03:00,746 --> 00:03:04,560
the case really came down to
one person's word against another's.

48
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,973
And in this instance,

49
00:03:06,026 --> 00:03:10,560
we feel bound to consider Dr Finch's
many years' exemplary practice

50
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,973
and his reputation
as a hard-working, generous

51
00:03:13,973 --> 00:03:16,231
and trustworthy GP.

52
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,320
And as such, we find
we do not uphold the complaint.

53
00:03:20,328 --> 00:03:24,355
I heard him. He might sit there now
looking like butter wouldn't melt,

54
00:03:24,364 --> 00:03:27,400
but he's got another side to him.

55
00:03:27,413 --> 00:03:30,560
Yeah, you look embarrassed, mate.

56
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,560
You should, 'cause you're a disgrace!

57
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,400
Gov.

58
00:03:54,426 --> 00:03:55,813
 Yep? 
- He's here.

59
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,764
'Peter, its Mark Harper.

60
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,457
'Kate and I can find no record
of any paperwork

61
00:04:07,457 --> 00:04:09,560
'relating to an ISA
in the name of Salthouse

62
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:13,080
'and I need to know today
how a three-grand cheque from him

63
00:04:13,084 --> 00:04:14,560
'has been cashed. So,

64
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,502
'you really need to call me.'

65
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,560
There.

66
00:04:59,831 --> 00:05:01,920
OK,

67
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,400
I'm going to change
all of your settings

68
00:05:04,408 --> 00:05:06,560
so that only your friends
can comment.

69
00:05:06,657 --> 00:05:10,728
What does it make them feel
when they say those things?

70
00:05:10,746 --> 00:05:13,911
I doubt very much
they feel anything at all, Mum.

71
00:05:14,755 --> 00:05:16,560
'Cause they're messed up.

72
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:22,560
And that, that isn't about Dad
or about you or Hayley.

73
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,840
It's about them.

74
00:05:26,186 --> 00:05:30,640
It's just a mirror people hold up
to themselves to shout at.

75
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:38,915
I wanted, if I may,
to ask you about a house you rented

76
00:05:38,915 --> 00:05:41,342
in Middenham, in December 1999,

77
00:05:41,342 --> 00:05:44,284
which I believe,

78
00:05:44,426 --> 00:05:46,586
was an eight-bedroom house.

79
00:05:46,657 --> 00:05:50,920
Yes, I can't remember specifically
but, yes, it was big.

80
00:05:50,942 --> 00:05:53,288
- There were a bunch of us.
- Three other families?

81
00:05:53,297 --> 00:05:55,226
Yes, although,
for the first few days,

82
00:05:55,226 --> 00:05:57,653
there were only me and three mates.

83
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,560
Our wives and kids
joined us on New Year's Eve.

84
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,400
Right.

85
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,737
It was primarily a golfing break.

86
00:06:04,746 --> 00:06:06,435
Mm, OK.

87
00:06:06,462 --> 00:06:09,560
And what were their names,
please, the men?

88
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,560
Tim Finch.

89
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,146
Chris Lowe.

90
00:06:15,262 --> 00:06:17,057
Pete Carr.

91
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,826
- And are they all still around?
- Yep.

92
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,560
Still friends?

93
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,053
Yes, we were at school together,
so it's a long connection.

94
00:06:26,213 --> 00:06:30,408
And the families, can you
give me details of those people?

95
00:06:30,648 --> 00:06:34,560
Tim was there
with his first wife Derran

96
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,355
and their two little girls.

97
00:06:38,382 --> 00:06:40,675
Pete was single at that time,
so on his own.

98
00:06:40,675 --> 00:06:44,560
And Chris Lowe was with his first
wife Laura and their little girl.

99
00:06:46,133 --> 00:06:48,506
And your wife?

100
00:06:48,897 --> 00:06:52,560
Yes, my wife Mel
and our little boy Eliot.

101
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,560
- Are you two still together?
- No.

102
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,822
- I remarried a few years ago.
- Oh.

103
00:06:59,111 --> 00:07:03,297
So, this is a photo of Hayley Reid.

104
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,328
Do you recognise her?

105
00:07:12,142 --> 00:07:13,902
Yes.

106
00:07:13,928 --> 00:07:17,560
- And is that just from the papers?
- Sorry, where is this heading?

107
00:07:17,822 --> 00:07:22,560
We're just trying to corroborate
evidence from another witness,

108
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:28,133
who thinks Hayley might have cleaned
the house you rented.

109
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,493
- I have no recollection of that.
- You never saw her there?

110
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:32,560
No.

111
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,360
I mean, we were out most days,

112
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,915
but, hey, this story was huge
and her photo was all over the TV.

113
00:07:38,915 --> 00:07:42,720
So, if she had cleaned our house
and any of us had have seen her,

114
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,595
- then I think someone would have
mentioned something.    - Absolutely.

115
00:07:50,008 --> 00:07:52,293
When did you return to London,
Mr Hollis?

116
00:07:52,293 --> 00:07:55,760
When the rental ended,
which would be

117
00:07:55,786 --> 00:07:58,826
perhaps
around the second or third.

118
00:07:58,835 --> 00:08:02,257
- And you drove back up
with your wife and child?   - Yes.

119
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:05,760
How did they got down there
on the 31st?

120
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,560
Train. I picked them up
from a nearby station.

121
00:08:11,768 --> 00:08:14,560
OK. And this is the last question.

122
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:20,151
What did you all get up to
on the Millennium evening?

123
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,737
Well, as I remember, we,

124
00:08:24,924 --> 00:08:27,920
we had a meal in the house,
all together.

125
00:08:29,102 --> 00:08:31,733
Then, I think the...

126
00:08:31,804 --> 00:08:36,337
the children stayed up a bit,
till about nine or ten.

127
00:08:36,373 --> 00:08:40,560
I think the adults watched a movie

128
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,928
and then all went to bed
after Big Ben.

129
00:08:43,973 --> 00:08:47,644
- Is that all of you?
- As I recall, yes.

130
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,697
And then no-one went out again
for the rest of the night?

131
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,253
No.

132
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,315
OK.

133
00:08:58,151 --> 00:08:59,706
That's it.

134
00:08:59,742 --> 00:09:02,835
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much for your time.

135
00:09:09,928 --> 00:09:11,920
Sorry.

136
00:09:11,982 --> 00:09:14,560
- You said you guys met at school.
- Yes.

137
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,826
- Where was that,
the school you went to?   - Finchley.

138
00:09:16,826 --> 00:09:19,706
Right. And you all

139
00:09:19,706 --> 00:09:22,728
- lived round that area?
- Within a couple of miles, yes.

140
00:09:22,746 --> 00:09:25,120
OK, thanks again.

141
00:09:31,262 --> 00:09:33,928
Well, I think we want
to know more about four guys

142
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,804
who grew up
half a mile from her grave.

143
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,560
I think we do.

144
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,560
Hollis, you wanker.

145
00:09:51,848 --> 00:09:53,560
Shit!

146
00:10:05,084 --> 00:10:07,760
And this sort of sized garden
is very unusual

147
00:10:07,777 --> 00:10:10,355
for a flat in this part of the city.

148
00:10:10,408 --> 00:10:12,240
It's also west-facing, so...

149
00:10:13,982 --> 00:10:18,266
Anyway, have a natter
and I'll be outside if you need me.

150
00:10:18,266 --> 00:10:19,560
Thank you.

151
00:10:23,244 --> 00:10:25,840
He's never had a garden
with grass before.

152
00:10:25,857 --> 00:10:27,760
You like it.

153
00:10:27,777 --> 00:10:30,000
I think it's perfect.

154
00:10:30,017 --> 00:10:31,786
What?

155
00:10:31,786 --> 00:10:33,653
There's a "but" coming.

156
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,560
But,

157
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,560
if we're going to be
properly together,

158
00:10:41,795 --> 00:10:44,400
I need to know who you are, Chris.

159
00:10:46,195 --> 00:10:47,955
Who I am?

160
00:10:48,711 --> 00:10:50,213
How does someone like you,

161
00:10:50,213 --> 00:10:55,680
so brilliant, so lovely,

162
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,208
end up like you have?

163
00:10:59,235 --> 00:11:01,386
How does that happen?

164
00:11:39,066 --> 00:11:41,866
So we had two key leads
that I believed

165
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:44,920
were potentially significant,
but were never resolved.

166
00:11:44,942 --> 00:11:47,022
St Matthew's C of E,

167
00:11:47,031 --> 00:11:49,306
which was burgled at some
point that New Year's Eve,

168
00:11:49,306 --> 00:11:52,186
with about five grand's worth
of 18-century silverware

169
00:11:52,186 --> 00:11:53,911
taken from a locked cupboard
in the vestry.

170
00:11:53,911 --> 00:11:57,217
Blood smears were retrieved on
some smashed glass into the vestry,

171
00:11:57,217 --> 00:12:00,720
but there were no matches
with anyone on our database.

172
00:12:00,817 --> 00:12:03,857
The church
is about halfway between The Swan

173
00:12:03,866 --> 00:12:06,160
and Hayley's parents'
original house.

174
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,586
And one possible theory was that

175
00:12:08,622 --> 00:12:10,897
she saw something after
she left work,

176
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:15,080
she went to investigate and
ran into the burglar or burglars.

177
00:12:15,102 --> 00:12:18,728
Certainly, I believe
it's worth following up again.

178
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,560
And then a black car,

179
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:24,328
which was seen driving
very erratically on the road

180
00:12:24,328 --> 00:12:27,013
between The Swan and her house

181
00:12:27,022 --> 00:12:29,288
at approximately 12:25,

182
00:12:29,288 --> 00:12:32,240
maybe 15 minutes after we know
she left the pub.

183
00:12:32,257 --> 00:12:33,760
No reg or make,

184
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,640
but the witness thought
it was a black four-door saloon

185
00:12:36,648 --> 00:12:37,946
with a tow bar.

186
00:12:37,964 --> 00:12:41,560
Oh, and it's worth mentioning that
the weather was very bad that night, with

187
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,088
heavy rain
from about 11 o'clock onwards

188
00:12:44,106 --> 00:12:46,560
and very poor visibility.

189
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,955
That's it.

190
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,435
So John will be available
for the rest of the day,

191
00:12:52,462 --> 00:12:55,240
and then on the phone,
at any point, for any questions.

192
00:12:55,253 --> 00:12:56,515
But given what he's just told us,

193
00:12:56,515 --> 00:13:00,560
I suggest DNA swabs should be taken
from any suspects we speak to.

194
00:13:00,968 --> 00:13:04,560
Thank you again, John.
That was very useful.

195
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,240
So,

196
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,400
specific points of action.

197
00:13:08,906 --> 00:13:12,560
Fran, can you double-check
all these timelines, please,

198
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,897
for Hayley's movements
on the night of her disappearance

199
00:13:14,897 --> 00:13:16,533
- and the week before?
- Boss.

200
00:13:16,622 --> 00:13:20,364
- Murray, you take the witness
who saw this car.   - Yup.

201
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:24,240
And, Jake, obviously,
the body was found in London

202
00:13:24,257 --> 00:13:26,560
and, given that new development,

203
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,560
- it's worth having another chat
with Adrian Mullery, I think.  - Gov.

204
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:33,560
And following this morning's
interview with James Hollis,

205
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,920
myself and DI Khan
will certainly be speaking

206
00:13:35,937 --> 00:13:39,644
to the other three male
occupants of The Spinney.

207
00:13:40,693 --> 00:13:44,204
OK, that's it. Thank you, everyone.

208
00:13:45,084 --> 00:13:47,777
That was great. Thank you again.

209
00:13:47,777 --> 00:13:48,462
- Yeah.
- No problem.

210
00:13:48,462 --> 00:13:51,226
So are you heading back down
tonight or?

211
00:13:51,253 --> 00:13:54,124
No. No, no, my kids
live with their mum in town,

212
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:58,560
so I'm going to stick around, spend
some time with them for a few days.

213
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,977
- Right. How old are they?
- 21 and 20.

214
00:14:00,986 --> 00:14:03,075
Ah, same as mine. Boys or?

215
00:14:03,084 --> 00:14:04,204
Two boys.

216
00:14:04,231 --> 00:14:04,995
Jinx.

217
00:14:05,004 --> 00:14:06,600
Hm!

218
00:14:06,622 --> 00:14:09,560
Anyway, I better go
and check into the hotel, so...

219
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:12,560
- Go for it. And we will
speak soon, I hope.  - Yeah, absolutely.

220
00:14:12,951 --> 00:14:15,560
John. Thanks for that.
That was great.

221
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:18,337
Listen, if you're at
a loose end any evening,

222
00:14:18,346 --> 00:14:20,791
there's always a few of us
at The Enterprise,

223
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:22,995
if you fancy a drink.
It's just opposite.

224
00:14:23,004 --> 00:14:24,275
Yeah, great. Cheers.

225
00:14:24,275 --> 00:14:25,413
- I might take you up on that.
- Good.

226
00:14:25,413 --> 00:14:26,906
- All right, see you.
- See you.

227
00:14:26,968 --> 00:14:29,240
- See you.
- Cheers.

228
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:34,240
- Ah.
- You're welcome.

229
00:14:36,968 --> 00:14:40,133
- Yeah. 
- Hello.

230
00:14:40,737 --> 00:14:44,960
- Hola, gordo conejo.
- Hola, muy gordo conejo.

231
00:14:44,995 --> 00:14:47,560
- How you doing?
- Yeah, all good. You?

232
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,760
Yeah, very well. I've just been
in Manchester on a work thing,

233
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,560
driving back to Sussex now with Caz.

234
00:14:52,568 --> 00:14:54,240
- Oh, right. Give her my love.
- I will.

235
00:14:54,355 --> 00:14:58,391
But listen, very quickly,
I presume you've seen the news

236
00:14:58,391 --> 00:14:59,786
about the Hayley Reid case.

237
00:14:59,795 --> 00:15:03,368
- Yeah, I did. It's very sad.
- Oh, wasn't it?

238
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,240
Anyway, the police are obviously
doing a general trawl

239
00:15:06,248 --> 00:15:08,231
for potential new witnesses.

240
00:15:08,231 --> 00:15:12,133
And they spoke to me this morning
about the house we rented.

241
00:15:12,204 --> 00:15:13,333
Right.

242
00:15:13,448 --> 00:15:16,560
- Apparently they think
she may have been our cleaner.   - Wow!

243
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,746
I said I couldn't recall us
having a cleaner

244
00:15:18,746 --> 00:15:20,924
and I certainly think one of us
would have noticed

245
00:15:20,924 --> 00:15:23,875
- if it had have been her, given
the amount of coverage.   - Indeed.

246
00:15:23,884 --> 00:15:25,662
Anyway, the long and short is

247
00:15:25,662 --> 00:15:28,995
they're probably going to want to
speak to the whole gang of us, so,

248
00:15:29,048 --> 00:15:31,560
I just thought
that I ought to let you know.

249
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,693
Yeah, no worries.

250
00:15:32,702 --> 00:15:34,560
Obviously,
they're looking for people

251
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,355
who may have seen something
that only now seems relevant.

252
00:15:38,364 --> 00:15:41,137
But I told them we all
stayed in the house that night,

253
00:15:41,146 --> 00:15:43,560
eating with our families, so...

254
00:15:43,706 --> 00:15:45,560
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

255
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:48,480
I'll give Pete a bell and maybe
you could give Chris the heads up?

256
00:15:48,488 --> 00:15:48,995
Sure.

257
00:15:48,995 --> 00:15:51,191
And I've e-mailed some dates
for our meet-up.

258
00:15:51,217 --> 00:15:53,351
Oh, yeah, I saw. Item...?

259
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,710
- I can do any of those.
- Excellent!

260
00:15:55,751 --> 00:15:57,560
Speak soon, mate.

261
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,920
Yeah, cheers, Jamie.

262
00:16:02,213 --> 00:16:03,946
Jamie sends his love.

263
00:16:04,008 --> 00:16:05,920
How is he?

264
00:16:05,973 --> 00:16:07,093
Oh, he's very well.

265
00:16:07,111 --> 00:16:10,924
He's just trying to arrange
a get-together.

266
00:16:10,986 --> 00:16:12,480
The four amigos.

267
00:16:12,497 --> 00:16:14,560
That'll be nice.

268
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,440
Yeah, it will.

269
00:16:15,448 --> 00:16:17,911
It's been too long. Much too long.

270
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,364
Of course I remember.

271
00:16:22,391 --> 00:16:24,088
I was meant to have bought
the puddings and I forgot,

272
00:16:24,088 --> 00:16:26,764
so I legged it to the corner shop
and bought a load of Cornettos,

273
00:16:26,764 --> 00:16:28,755
which your ex
wasn't too happy about.

274
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,124
Anyway, I just wanted to check that
you remembered it the same as I did.

275
00:16:32,222 --> 00:16:34,435
So, we're all ready for the 22nd.

276
00:16:34,444 --> 00:16:37,813
Chris has replied now so I'll book
a table and send you all a link.

277
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:40,044
Just one quick thing
before you go, Jamie.

278
00:16:40,044 --> 00:16:42,684
Actually, I'm literally
just heading into a meeting, mate.

279
00:16:42,684 --> 00:16:44,168
Yeah, yeah, I'll be ten seconds.

280
00:16:44,222 --> 00:16:47,400
Jamie, I need a massive favour.

281
00:16:50,204 --> 00:16:52,560
I was married for

282
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,373
12 years

283
00:16:54,453 --> 00:16:57,235
and I had, have, I have a daughter,

284
00:16:57,235 --> 00:16:58,408
Maya,

285
00:16:58,444 --> 00:17:01,706
who I last saw 17 years ago.

286
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,675
My marriage ended early 2000.

287
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,764
And because of some issues
that I had at the time,

288
00:17:10,764 --> 00:17:12,062
my wife Laura,

289
00:17:12,062 --> 00:17:15,208
she felt it was damaging for Maya
to be around that.

290
00:17:15,271 --> 00:17:17,946
And I'd run up some debts.

291
00:17:17,946 --> 00:17:21,768
So I went from living in
a nice house in Notting Hill to

292
00:17:21,768 --> 00:17:24,213
a one-bedroom flat in Acton

293
00:17:25,022 --> 00:17:28,400
and then a hostel and

294
00:17:28,586 --> 00:17:30,760
and then the streets.

295
00:17:30,844 --> 00:17:32,906
How long were you homeless?

296
00:17:33,902 --> 00:17:37,137
On and off for seven years.

297
00:17:37,164 --> 00:17:39,128
Oh, Chris.

298
00:17:39,315 --> 00:17:42,026
I'm so sorry.

299
00:17:42,035 --> 00:17:43,973
And you had no friends
who could have helped you?

300
00:17:43,982 --> 00:17:46,782
Yeah. Yeah. I had friends who would
have been desperate to help me.

301
00:17:46,782 --> 00:17:49,560
Yeah, but you have to want
to be helped. And I didn't.

302
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,724
I hated myself. I thought I deserved
everything that happened to me.

303
00:17:53,777 --> 00:17:56,284
And your marriage,

304
00:17:56,302 --> 00:17:58,560
he issues you mention?

305
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,231
OK, so,

306
00:18:00,257 --> 00:18:03,560
as you know,
I have bipolar disorder,

307
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:06,826
which was undiagnosed at the time,
and so it was unmedicated,

308
00:18:06,844 --> 00:18:08,560
which meant that,

309
00:18:08,675 --> 00:18:12,808
you know, my behaviour
was challenging.

310
00:18:13,137 --> 00:18:16,106
And as soon as I started
costing my company money,

311
00:18:16,106 --> 00:18:18,888
it was inevitable
I'd be asked to step down.

312
00:18:21,173 --> 00:18:24,560
And that was
just not what she had married,

313
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:27,400
an unemployed man
who had mental health issues.

314
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,888
So she asked me to leave.

315
00:18:31,884 --> 00:18:33,560
And I did.

316
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:37,928
And then, 18 months later,
she married a hedge fund manager,

317
00:18:37,928 --> 00:18:41,333
who bought her a house
in Holland Park, so.

318
00:18:43,093 --> 00:18:46,435
And then, in 2012,

319
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:51,386
Maya wrote to tell me that
Laura had died from breast cancer

320
00:18:52,017 --> 00:18:55,555
and to ask that I stay away
from the funeral.

321
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,013
I thought about writing back,
and saying that I was better now,

322
00:18:59,013 --> 00:19:01,315
that I was a different person,

323
00:19:01,315 --> 00:19:02,560
and I am.

324
00:19:04,213 --> 00:19:05,973
But I think there comes a time

325
00:19:05,973 --> 00:19:08,915
when you have to accept
how things have turned out.

326
00:19:09,075 --> 00:19:12,782
That life can sometimes
simply be unfair.

327
00:19:12,817 --> 00:19:15,884
And to keep resisting that,

328
00:19:15,911 --> 00:19:19,262
it takes so much energy, Mila,

329
00:19:20,302 --> 00:19:24,391
energy that you need for the future.

330
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:40,760
Love?

331
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,528
In here.

332
00:19:43,608 --> 00:19:45,560
Hey, Pete.

333
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,071
Hello, Mark.

334
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,475
What a lovely lady your missus is.

335
00:19:51,777 --> 00:19:53,768
I was just about to call you.

336
00:19:53,768 --> 00:19:55,813
You're punching above your weight
there, buddy.

337
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,266
Three grand,

338
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:04,737
and my apologies.

339
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,960
I was stressed about some deals
and screwed up the paperwork.

340
00:20:08,968 --> 00:20:12,346
I accidentally paid Salthouse's
cheque into my personal account.

341
00:20:12,355 --> 00:20:14,080
But,

342
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,431
there it is,

343
00:20:17,813 --> 00:20:19,560
all there.

344
00:20:24,675 --> 00:20:28,364
You know what we used to call
blokes like Pete, Maria?

345
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,560
Filth.

346
00:20:32,008 --> 00:20:35,235
Failed in London, tried Hong-Kong.

347
00:20:35,262 --> 00:20:37,560
Bit of a Wild West out there,
wasn't it, mate?

348
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,080
Attracted a very distinct
sort of person.

349
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:43,560
I see you, buddy.

350
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:50,560
Lovely to meet you, Maria.
I'll let myself out.

351
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:02,035
I'm sorry about that.

352
00:21:05,111 --> 00:21:07,351
I need a shower.

353
00:21:08,817 --> 00:21:11,217
This isn't working, Pete.

354
00:21:11,653 --> 00:21:13,560
You and me.

355
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,142
I'm sorry, but

356
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,026
this just isn't what I thought
I was buying.

357
00:21:22,106 --> 00:21:24,826
It'll get better, babes.

358
00:21:25,573 --> 00:21:27,560
Trust me.

359
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,822
I've got some really good business
coming in.

360
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,560
Oh, I forgot to say, I've got
a couple of guests arriving.

361
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,737
Can you show them in, please, Liz?

362
00:22:00,737 --> 00:22:01,911
Yes.

363
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,884
Thanks.

364
00:22:16,097 --> 00:22:18,204
Adrian.

365
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:22,071
Have you got five minutes?

366
00:22:36,248 --> 00:22:38,746
Well, obviously I recognise her,

367
00:22:38,746 --> 00:22:42,017
but I don't recall ever seeing her
at the house at any point.

368
00:22:42,026 --> 00:22:43,902
As Jamie said,

369
00:22:43,902 --> 00:22:46,835
if we had have seen her, we would
have discussed it at the time.

370
00:22:46,835 --> 00:22:49,400
- It was a huge story.
- Absolutely.

371
00:22:51,804 --> 00:22:53,560
So,

372
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:57,560
Mr Hollis, he told us
that the four of you had gone down

373
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:01,146
- on your own, at first, to play golf.
- Yes.

374
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:07,182
And then your wife Derran
and your girls arrived on the 31st.

375
00:23:07,182 --> 00:23:08,284
Yes.

376
00:23:08,364 --> 00:23:10,275
And how old were they, the kids?

377
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:13,457
Claire would have been eight

378
00:23:13,617 --> 00:23:16,195
and Emma just turned ten.

379
00:23:16,275 --> 00:23:18,266
I'm sorry,
just to go back on one thing.

380
00:23:18,302 --> 00:23:21,955
New Year's, the kids
would have gone to bed at...?

381
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:25,555
Nine, ten, maybe.

382
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:29,271
- And no-one went out after that?
- Nope.

383
00:23:30,302 --> 00:23:33,351
What car where you driving
back then, Dr Finch?

384
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:40,551
I had my Audi in '99,
I think. An A4.

385
00:23:40,711 --> 00:23:43,080
Sorry, was that the saloon or...?

386
00:23:43,084 --> 00:23:48,195
No, the Estate. We needed
the space for holidays and stuff,

387
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,435
to save faffing around with a
top box or a trailer or any of that.

388
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,240
And what colour was it?

389
00:23:54,906 --> 00:23:56,560
Silver.

390
00:23:57,111 --> 00:24:01,560
And your wife and kids,
they went down by train?

391
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:04,915
With Jamie's wife and son.

392
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:10,142
- And everybody headed back to London
on the 2nd?   - Yes.

393
00:24:11,288 --> 00:24:13,066
Did you all live in London then?

394
00:24:13,084 --> 00:24:15,120
All except Pete.

395
00:24:15,128 --> 00:24:17,946
He lived in Hong Kong.

396
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:23,662
And your marriage to Derran,
that ended when?

397
00:24:24,853 --> 00:24:30,151
What relevance has
when my marriage ended to anything?

398
00:24:30,604 --> 00:24:34,453
Sorry. If any question
makes you feel uncomfortable,

399
00:24:34,453 --> 00:24:36,808
you don't have to answer.

400
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:40,933
- We separated in 2001.
- OK.

401
00:24:41,164 --> 00:24:44,560
And do you remember when Mr Hollis
and his wife separated?

402
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:48,071
Same year, I think. Or maybe 2000.

403
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,973
And Chris Lowe and his wife?

404
00:24:50,026 --> 00:24:53,528
Yeah, roughly the same time.

405
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:56,311
And are you still in contact
with Derran,

406
00:24:56,311 --> 00:24:58,560
if we wanted to speak with her?

407
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,640
I haven't seen Derran
for many years,

408
00:25:00,648 --> 00:25:02,968
but I can get a number from my kids,
if you need it.

409
00:25:02,968 --> 00:25:04,640
That would be very helpful,
thank you.

410
00:25:04,675 --> 00:25:07,973
Oh, I should just say that

411
00:25:08,106 --> 00:25:14,222
she's had a number of issues
over the last couple of decades,

412
00:25:14,222 --> 00:25:16,560
depression, anxiety and so,

413
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,275
I'm not entirely sure
you'll find her

414
00:25:18,275 --> 00:25:20,560
the most reliable of narrators.

415
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,560
OK.

416
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,560
Well, thank you for that.

417
00:25:25,617 --> 00:25:28,364
And then, one last thing,

418
00:25:28,382 --> 00:25:30,693
and, I should say,

419
00:25:30,693 --> 00:25:32,951
do feel free to say no.

420
00:25:33,057 --> 00:25:37,315
But in order to help
eliminate you from our enquiries,

421
00:25:37,315 --> 00:25:39,484
how would you feel about
giving us a DNA swab?

422
00:25:39,564 --> 00:25:41,560
Yes, of course. No problem.

423
00:25:42,933 --> 00:25:47,560
So, if nobody went out after ten,
then it can't be them.

424
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:50,560
I mean, we know Hayley
was seen alive at 12:10, so...

425
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,560
Yeah, I think you're right.

426
00:25:54,222 --> 00:25:56,266
And if we're spinning our wheels
on these guys,

427
00:25:56,266 --> 00:25:58,560
I don't want to waste any more time.

428
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,906
Let's take the last two separately.

429
00:26:01,031 --> 00:26:03,080
Hi, Dad, it's me.

430
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:06,844
Look, I'm really sorry,
I'm going to be a bit late.

431
00:26:08,195 --> 00:26:11,475
Please call me.

432
00:26:21,768 --> 00:26:24,560
How many times
have you been here before, Jamie?

433
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,560
It'll be fine.

434
00:26:27,262 --> 00:26:30,115
You know,
the longer this goes on,

435
00:26:30,293 --> 00:26:32,844
the more his problems

436
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,804
consume him.

437
00:26:36,062 --> 00:26:41,484
The more you look at the paths we
took, the choices we made, I made,

438
00:26:41,493 --> 00:26:43,351
and think -

439
00:26:43,902 --> 00:26:45,600
was it then?

440
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,760
Was it that choice or

441
00:26:47,786 --> 00:26:49,706
that choice

442
00:26:49,715 --> 00:26:51,560
that messed everything up?

443
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:54,115
Was it then

444
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,964
that I ruined my child's life?

445
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,560
Call me.

446
00:27:19,377 --> 00:27:21,457
Sometimes, I just...

447
00:27:21,573 --> 00:27:23,560
- Hi.
- Hello.

448
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:26,142
Gemma left some school books
at mine, I brought them round.

449
00:27:26,142 --> 00:27:28,760
- And then she wanted
to show me her room.  - Right.

450
00:27:28,773 --> 00:27:31,466
- Lovely place, though.
- Thank you.

451
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:35,457
Anyway, I need to shoot off.

452
00:27:35,857 --> 00:27:37,750
- Nice to see you.
- And you.

453
00:27:37,777 --> 00:27:39,560
Bye, girls.

454
00:27:40,977 --> 00:27:43,560
- Bye.
- Bye.

455
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:51,262
Yeah, well, you see, I'm from the
clip-round-the-ear-hole generation.

456
00:27:51,262 --> 00:27:54,560
- I think he'd still like to,
to be honest.   - Oh, dear.

457
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,755
- And do you have children?
- No!

458
00:27:57,235 --> 00:27:58,835
Never had the
urge to be a mother.

459
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:01,368
- Wow. Smart move.
- Tell me about it.

460
00:28:01,377 --> 00:28:02,862
They take so much from you,
don't they?

461
00:28:02,862 --> 00:28:06,053
- Not sure I'd see it quite like.
- Just, I'm too selfish, I think.

462
00:28:06,053 --> 00:28:08,231
- Yeah?
- Liked my career too much.

463
00:28:08,266 --> 00:28:12,231
I think, if you are going to have
children, you need to be around.

464
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,471
- Whoops.
- Well, yes. I mean,

465
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,431
an evening like tonight,
it's fine you letting us down but,

466
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:21,946
how did you cope
when that was your kids,

467
00:28:21,955 --> 00:28:23,795
turning up two hours late
for supper?

468
00:28:23,804 --> 00:28:27,404
Oh, we muddled through.

469
00:28:28,426 --> 00:28:31,653
Anyway, Dad tells me
you're off to Venice at the weekend.

470
00:28:31,653 --> 00:28:36,382
- I know. You should tell him
to stop spoiling me.   - I should.

471
00:28:36,426 --> 00:28:38,728
And first class, too.

472
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:41,182
Venice?

473
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,560
Right. Yeah.

474
00:28:53,297 --> 00:28:56,266
Funny. Very funny.

475
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,746
Actually that's not quite
what I said.

476
00:29:04,755 --> 00:29:05,866
OK.

477
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:09,777
I have it here, you said you
saw her leave just after midnight.

478
00:29:09,786 --> 00:29:11,070
No, I said she would have left

479
00:29:11,075 --> 00:29:12,995
just after her shift <i>ended</i>
at midnight.

480
00:29:12,995 --> 00:29:15,080
I never said I actually saw her.

481
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,426
Right.

482
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:19,662
Guy Halford, the manager,
he's the one who actually saw her.

483
00:29:19,964 --> 00:29:24,053
Sorry. And so what was
the last time you saw her?

484
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,946
Just before 11.

485
00:29:25,982 --> 00:29:27,920
I was working through till three and

486
00:29:27,937 --> 00:29:29,560
I took a half-hour break then.

487
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,377
When Guy came back,
he put me in the bar

488
00:29:31,377 --> 00:29:34,728
and I just presumed that Hayley
was finishing up in the restaurant.

489
00:29:34,737 --> 00:29:38,791
And Guy Halford,
does he still live in Middenham?

490
00:30:01,413 --> 00:30:03,560
- Hi.
- Hi.

491
00:30:03,982 --> 00:30:07,920
I'm looking for Christopher Lowe.

492
00:30:07,928 --> 00:30:09,560
Hello.

493
00:30:20,186 --> 00:30:21,560
Go on.

494
00:30:22,284 --> 00:30:23,928
Stay there. Stay.

495
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:39,297
- Mr Carr?
- Yeah.

496
00:30:41,048 --> 00:30:45,022
DI Sunny Khan.
Have you got five minutes?

497
00:30:52,888 --> 00:30:54,560
No, I'm...

498
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,400
Sorry.

499
00:30:56,426 --> 00:30:57,991
OK.

500
00:30:59,973 --> 00:31:01,822
Absolutely sure?

501
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,604
- Yeah.
- You know who she is, though?

502
00:31:04,657 --> 00:31:06,746
Yeah. Of course, yeah.

503
00:31:06,764 --> 00:31:10,977
I mean, I never saw her
in that house.

504
00:31:11,457 --> 00:31:14,417
- Are you OK, Mr Lowe?
- Yeah.

505
00:31:14,435 --> 00:31:15,911
Yeah, I just...

506
00:31:15,946 --> 00:31:17,920
I don't cope with stress very well.

507
00:31:17,982 --> 00:31:20,853
- Would you prefer to have
someone with you?   - No. No.

508
00:31:20,853 --> 00:31:23,560
- No, I'm fine, fine for now.
- OK.

509
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,560
So we're just asking everyone
we speak to

510
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:28,826
a number of general questions
to help us with our enquiries.

511
00:31:28,826 --> 00:31:33,377
So, can you tell me
what car you were driving that week?

512
00:31:33,386 --> 00:31:36,231
I didn't take a car.
I went down with Tim.

513
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:40,995
And then, did you and your family
travel back with him or...?

514
00:31:41,031 --> 00:31:43,093
My wife drove down
with our daughter and

515
00:31:43,093 --> 00:31:44,560
we went back in her car.

516
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,760
Right.

517
00:31:45,804 --> 00:31:48,044
So what car was she driving?

518
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:52,097
She would have been
driving the Maserati.

519
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,560
Right.

520
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:19,724
You know what?
I think I did see her at the house.

521
00:32:21,137 --> 00:32:23,760
Right. Are you sure?

522
00:32:23,795 --> 00:32:26,560
Yeah. Just one time, but,

523
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,560
she's got a distinctive face,
I guess.

524
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:31,191
- I think that was her.
- OK.

525
00:32:31,297 --> 00:32:33,560
Was that on your own or...?

526
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,395
I'd come back
from a round early.

527
00:32:35,395 --> 00:32:38,764
I was still a bit jet-lagged, so
I went back to the house for a kip.

528
00:32:38,764 --> 00:32:41,377
When I walked in,
she was there, hoovering.

529
00:32:41,413 --> 00:32:45,306
I said hello and asked if there
was anything else she could do,

530
00:32:45,306 --> 00:32:46,853
'cause of the noise.

531
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,400
What day would that have been?

532
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,440
Oh.

533
00:32:49,448 --> 00:32:53,022
I'd have to check a calendar.
Do you know when it was rented from?

534
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,560
Yeah.

535
00:32:56,275 --> 00:32:57,946
Monday the 27th.

536
00:32:57,950 --> 00:33:01,902
Monday. Well, we arrived
in the evening, I remember that.

537
00:33:01,946 --> 00:33:04,240
I think we just chilled
the next day,

538
00:33:04,257 --> 00:33:06,124
had a couple of bevvies
in the local

539
00:33:06,124 --> 00:33:08,080
and played our first round
the day after.

540
00:33:08,106 --> 00:33:11,484
So, I'm thinking the Wednesday.

541
00:33:11,795 --> 00:33:15,120
Just to go back to
the conversation with her,

542
00:33:15,244 --> 00:33:17,560
- was it just about the hoovering,
was it?   - Yeah.

543
00:33:17,573 --> 00:33:21,400
When I woke up, the other lads
were back and she'd gone.

544
00:33:21,466 --> 00:33:24,444
And you didn't discuss this
with the others?

545
00:33:24,924 --> 00:33:26,600
Discuss what?

546
00:33:27,635 --> 00:33:30,560
That this girl,

547
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:34,808
who later went missing, had been
in the house you all rented.

548
00:33:34,808 --> 00:33:35,920
No.

549
00:33:35,973 --> 00:33:39,080
I mean, I drove back to London
on the 2nd

550
00:33:39,093 --> 00:33:43,084
and then flew out to Hong Kong
first thing the next day, so...

551
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,560
This was a big story?

552
00:33:46,133 --> 00:33:50,080
It was huge. It was in all
the national newspapers for weeks.

553
00:33:50,088 --> 00:33:53,644
Right, well, I had no idea
about that.

554
00:33:54,337 --> 00:33:58,328
And her photo being on the front
pages the last couple of days.

555
00:33:58,328 --> 00:34:01,560
Work's been crazy. I haven't
had time to look at the papers.

556
00:34:02,266 --> 00:34:07,653
I'm sorry, but the first I've ever
heard of this girl is now.

557
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:12,560
I suppose one of us
would have cooked

558
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:15,057
and then all of us,
with kids, I mean,

559
00:34:15,057 --> 00:34:16,302
would have eaten together.

560
00:34:16,328 --> 00:34:18,346
And that was a pleasant evening?

561
00:34:18,355 --> 00:34:20,053
- Yeah.
- Everyone had a nice time?

562
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,937
Yeah, we had a nice time.
Why do you ask that?

563
00:34:21,937 --> 00:34:23,560
Well, just

564
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:28,142
because Christmas and New Year
can be quite stressful, can't it?

565
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:31,560
And I understand your marriage
broke down not long after.

566
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,826
What has that got to do
with anything?

567
00:34:32,826 --> 00:34:34,648
Well, I wondered
if that was in any way,

568
00:34:34,648 --> 00:34:37,946
connected to something
that happened on this break.

569
00:34:37,955 --> 00:34:40,640
You know, I think I do,
I do need someone with me.

570
00:34:40,657 --> 00:34:43,351
Mm. And I can arrange that,
of course, but

571
00:34:43,351 --> 00:34:44,915
can you answer that question,
please?

572
00:34:44,915 --> 00:34:48,920
Because I'm aware that, of
the three of you that were married,

573
00:34:48,933 --> 00:34:52,080
all of you were separated
within the year.

574
00:34:52,088 --> 00:34:55,111
No, that was ...
nothing to do with anything

575
00:34:55,111 --> 00:34:56,560
that happened on that break.

576
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,560
So.

577
00:34:58,835 --> 00:35:00,560
Sure.

578
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,271
Who's that?

579
00:35:05,093 --> 00:35:08,933
That's my girlfriend and her son.
I want to stop now, please.

580
00:35:09,208 --> 00:35:10,560
One more thing.

581
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,386
Lastly, we're asking everyone
that we speak to

582
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:20,560
how they'd feel about
providing a DNA swab.

583
00:35:20,764 --> 00:35:23,217
Entirely voluntary of course.

584
00:35:23,395 --> 00:35:25,262
How would you feel about that?

585
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,217
Not a problem.

586
00:35:27,262 --> 00:35:29,715
Good. Won't take a minute.

587
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,004
Mr Mullery, DC Jake Collier.

588
00:35:39,004 --> 00:35:40,560
Have you got five minutes
for a quick chat, sir?

589
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,706
Now, you'll have my home address,

590
00:35:41,706 --> 00:35:43,946
but you decided to come here
because you thought what?

591
00:35:43,973 --> 00:35:45,484
That I'd be embarrassed

592
00:35:45,493 --> 00:35:47,822
and gratefully duck into some
car so no-one saw?

593
00:35:47,857 --> 00:35:50,560
I just want to ask
a few quick questions, sir.

594
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,600
So a couple of hours ago,
the head suggested

595
00:35:52,604 --> 00:35:53,937
that maybe I should take some leave.

596
00:35:53,937 --> 00:35:56,488
Some of the parents have been
uncomfortable with the situation.

597
00:35:56,488 --> 00:35:59,111
And, of course, I could refuse
because she has no legal right.

598
00:35:59,111 --> 00:36:02,560
But do you know what?
I have spent the past 18 years

599
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,631
telling people
that I wasn't even charged,

600
00:36:04,631 --> 00:36:06,257
that not one single piece
of evidence

601
00:36:06,257 --> 00:36:08,133
could ever be found
to incriminate me,

602
00:36:08,133 --> 00:36:10,124
that the lead detective retired

603
00:36:10,124 --> 00:36:12,222
just before a misconduct case
could be brought against him.

604
00:36:12,248 --> 00:36:14,995
So I am knackered

605
00:36:15,013 --> 00:36:18,657
and I'll take the paid break,
thank you very much.

606
00:36:18,657 --> 00:36:19,635
But what it also means

607
00:36:19,635 --> 00:36:22,791
is that I am not remotely
fucking embarrassed, mate.

608
00:36:22,897 --> 00:36:26,017
I am not remotely
embarrassed to stand here

609
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:29,475
and tell you loudly,
no, I will not talk to you.

610
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,880
I will not sit in a car or a room

611
00:36:30,888 --> 00:36:33,560
or anywhere with you,
voluntarily, ever.

612
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:36,613
And if you want to arrest me,
be my guest.

613
00:36:36,613 --> 00:36:39,004
But I'll not say
another fucking word to you,

614
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,084
not even, "No comment"

615
00:36:41,093 --> 00:36:43,560
because I think the police are scum.

616
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,920
I think you lie.
I think you break the law.

617
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,000
I think you take bribes
and you sell stories.

618
00:36:48,008 --> 00:36:52,017
But worse than that,
most unforgivable of all,

619
00:36:52,017 --> 00:36:54,231
I think you're thick.

620
00:36:54,408 --> 00:36:57,297
I think your ranks are made up
of dim-witted mediocrity

621
00:36:57,297 --> 00:36:58,986
who joined the force
because they wanted power

622
00:36:58,986 --> 00:37:02,488
but they're too stupid
to get employed anywhere else.

623
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:06,906
So shame on you

624
00:37:07,137 --> 00:37:09,560
for the way you treated me,

625
00:37:11,102 --> 00:37:15,004
for letting Hayley down
so catastrophically.

626
00:37:15,271 --> 00:37:20,080
And shame on you, DC Jake Collier,

627
00:37:20,568 --> 00:37:23,475
for becoming a police officer.

628
00:37:34,426 --> 00:37:36,311
And how sure did he seem?

629
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,560
Pretty sure.
It was an instinctive reaction.

630
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,408
I don't think he was recognising her
from the newspapers.

631
00:37:40,408 --> 00:37:42,977
So this definitively places her
in the house,

632
00:37:42,977 --> 00:37:46,400
- possibly with all four men, before
the wives and kids arrived?   - Yeah.

633
00:37:46,906 --> 00:37:48,995
What was he like otherwise?

634
00:37:49,137 --> 00:37:50,560
Odd.

635
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,462
An odd mixture.

636
00:37:52,551 --> 00:37:55,680
I mean, I guess you've got to ask,
why would he be telling me

637
00:37:55,688 --> 00:37:58,400
that he saw Hayley in the house
if he had something to hide?

638
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,560
But?

639
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:03,280
But when I asked him
if he'd give a DNA swab,

640
00:38:03,288 --> 00:38:06,000
he slightly looked like
he'd just shat himself.

641
00:38:08,035 --> 00:38:10,337
What's his background?

642
00:38:13,084 --> 00:38:16,560
Lived and worked in Hong Kong
for 25 years.

643
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:20,666
Only married for the first time
six years ago.

644
00:38:20,764 --> 00:38:23,560
No previous convictions,
at least not here.

645
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:24,600
And ah!

646
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:27,080
Drove down to Middenham
on a motorbike.

647
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:30,600
Do we have a response
from James Hollis about his car yet?

648
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:33,902
I'll chase that.
How was your man?

649
00:38:35,084 --> 00:38:36,560
So.

650
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,560
He lives in a camper van.

651
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,560
Oh.

652
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:44,560
I'd say he's definitely had
some mental health issues,

653
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,675
looks like he hasn't got
a pot to piss in.

654
00:38:46,675 --> 00:38:49,004
Except, in 1999,

655
00:38:49,111 --> 00:38:53,297
he was CEO of DDM Lowe,

656
00:38:53,297 --> 00:38:57,191
his own advertising agency.

657
00:38:57,244 --> 00:39:00,551
And this is a guy who got
a double first from Cambridge,

658
00:39:00,551 --> 00:39:03,395
was basically a bit of a genius
through his life,

659
00:39:03,395 --> 00:39:07,120
lived in a five million quid house
in Notting Hill.

660
00:39:07,244 --> 00:39:09,226
Wow. When did he leave?

661
00:39:09,262 --> 00:39:10,817
Early 2000.

662
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,395
"To pursue new challenges."

663
00:39:13,413 --> 00:39:15,560
What, like,
how to live in a car park?

664
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,080
DCI Stuart.

665
00:39:21,111 --> 00:39:23,920
Hello, I'm just returning your call.

666
00:39:23,946 --> 00:39:27,057
It's Mel Hollis here.
I'm James Hollis' ex-wife.

667
00:39:27,084 --> 00:39:30,640
Ah, Mrs Hollis.
Yeah, thanks for returning my call.

668
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,560
No, it wasn't a pleasant evening.

669
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:37,084
What it was,
was a train wreck.

670
00:39:37,111 --> 00:39:38,560
In what way?

671
00:39:38,871 --> 00:39:42,560
Look the meal was fine.
We ate, we cleared up,

672
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,880
the kids were knackered,
it'd been a long day getting there,

673
00:39:44,888 --> 00:39:47,155
so they went to bed about 9:30,

674
00:39:47,155 --> 00:39:49,848
which was good,
that they were in bed, I mean,

675
00:39:49,848 --> 00:39:54,560
because they didn't have to see
Chris go completely nuts,

676
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,302
- for want of a better word.
- How do you mean?

677
00:39:56,346 --> 00:39:59,733
Out of the blue,
he just started ranting about

678
00:39:59,742 --> 00:40:03,351
his life,
his marriage, his friends,

679
00:40:03,511 --> 00:40:07,404
how it all meant nothing,
how everything was an illusion.

680
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,346
- It was quiet terrifying.
- Wow, yeah, I can imagine.

681
00:40:10,364 --> 00:40:13,560
And so, what did people do?

682
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:16,560
Well, I mean, we all tried
to calm him down, obviously,

683
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,560
particularly Laura his wife.

684
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:23,031
But he was flailing his arms
and shouting and,

685
00:40:23,235 --> 00:40:26,257
to be honest,
we were all quite relieved

686
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:28,560
when he then just
suddenly walked out.

687
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,240
- Of the house?
- Mm-hm.

688
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,240
- And went where?
- I don't know.

689
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:35,973
Had he been drinking?

690
00:40:35,991 --> 00:40:37,635
Well, he'd had a few.

691
00:40:37,635 --> 00:40:40,897
We'd all had a few.
It was New Year's Eve.

692
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,560
Anything else?

693
00:40:43,804 --> 00:40:46,560
Someone might have bought some coke.

694
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,960
I don't know,
maybe he'd had a bit of that.

695
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,804
OK.

696
00:40:51,813 --> 00:40:54,106
So who was taking coke?

697
00:40:54,311 --> 00:40:57,191
Not me.
Not any of the women, actually.

698
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,666
Tim Finch?

699
00:40:58,666 --> 00:41:01,431
Definitely not, no.
He never did that.

700
00:41:01,475 --> 00:41:03,680
Pete, no, he was more of a drinker.

701
00:41:03,742 --> 00:41:06,471
James, yes.

702
00:41:06,471 --> 00:41:09,920
In fact, I think it was him
that probably bought it.

703
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:13,102
When Chris went out of the house,

704
00:41:13,102 --> 00:41:16,560
- what time would that have been?
- I don't know.

705
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:19,560
- Just after ten, I guess.
- And did anyone go after him?

706
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,560
Yeah, after a minute or two,

707
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,560
James and Tim.

708
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,791
- Did they catch up with him?
- No.

709
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,804
No, Chris came back on his own
about an hour and a half later.

710
00:41:29,804 --> 00:41:31,475
He was absolutely drenched.

711
00:41:31,475 --> 00:41:32,853
I mean, it was raining hard
at this point

712
00:41:32,853 --> 00:41:35,111
and his clothes
were covered with mud

713
00:41:35,111 --> 00:41:37,555
and he went straight upstairs
to bed.

714
00:41:37,768 --> 00:41:40,293
- No explanation, no apology, nothing.
- Right.

715
00:41:40,755 --> 00:41:42,444
Where was Pete Carr at this point?

716
00:41:42,453 --> 00:41:44,560
Pete had been out
since right after the meal,

717
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:47,560
- trying his luck at the pub.
- Trying his luck?

718
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:49,080
The ladies.

719
00:41:50,186 --> 00:41:51,937
He got back just after midnight.

720
00:41:51,937 --> 00:41:54,044
- On his own?
- Mm-hm.

721
00:41:54,124 --> 00:41:55,760
And pissed.

722
00:41:55,795 --> 00:41:59,520
- And your husband and Dr Finch?
- The same.

723
00:41:59,555 --> 00:42:01,560
No, they got back
just before midnight.

724
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:04,097
Just in time for Auld Lang Syne,
bless.

725
00:42:04,151 --> 00:42:06,560
Were they separate or together?

726
00:42:08,204 --> 00:42:10,213
I can't remember.

727
00:42:11,377 --> 00:42:13,560
And what happened then?

728
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,840
The guys went to bed,
the women stayed up

729
00:42:15,857 --> 00:42:20,160
- and talked about
our car crash marriages.   - OK.

730
00:42:20,373 --> 00:42:24,515
This is really important,
Ms Hollis, so,

731
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:27,804
I want you to think
very carefully, please.

732
00:42:27,893 --> 00:42:32,613
Did you see anyone go out again
after that?

733
00:42:32,631 --> 00:42:33,857
No.

734
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,324
No-one went out again after that.

735
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,880
You sound very certain.

736
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:46,364
Firstly, I sat up talking
to Laura and Derran

737
00:42:46,364 --> 00:42:49,560
till about three o'clock
in the morning, and then,

738
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:52,880
I wasn't going to sleep with James
that night, so I slept on the sofa.

739
00:42:52,897 --> 00:42:55,351
Except, I didn't, really.
Sleep, I mean.

740
00:42:55,351 --> 00:42:57,920
So that meant I would have seen
if anyone had gone out.

741
00:42:57,928 --> 00:42:59,413
And they didn't.

742
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,240
Right.

743
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:06,995
Fuck.

744
00:43:07,066 --> 00:43:10,764
The last sighting of her was after
they were all back in the house.

745
00:43:11,813 --> 00:43:14,177
- So she could be lying.
- Yep.

746
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:17,560
Or mistaken. Maybe she did sleep
and one of them came down

747
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:19,560
at four or five or whatever
and then went out.

748
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:22,115
Except, if one of them came down
at four or five,

749
00:43:22,124 --> 00:43:24,568
went out then and killed her,
where...

750
00:43:24,568 --> 00:43:28,560
where was Hayley between leaving
the pub at 12:10 and four or five?

751
00:43:28,577 --> 00:43:32,560
- No, that feels wrong.
- Yeah, maybe.

752
00:43:32,737 --> 00:43:34,675
But not as wrong as all four men

753
00:43:34,675 --> 00:43:36,337
having clearly lied to us
through their teeth.

754
00:43:36,337 --> 00:43:37,560
There is that.

755
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:40,862
I need a drink.

756
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,560
There is that.

757
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:59,560
Yeah, it was about ten past,

758
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:01,760
maybe quarter past midnight,

759
00:44:01,768 --> 00:44:04,168
- enough time to change, anyway.
- For the party?   - Yeah.

760
00:44:04,168 --> 00:44:07,013
'Cause she went as Madonna,

761
00:44:07,022 --> 00:44:08,826
the"Desperately Seeking Susan" one.

762
00:44:08,826 --> 00:44:11,395
You know, the slap and the hair
and everything.

763
00:44:11,404 --> 00:44:15,288
It was an '80s theme, I think.

764
00:44:16,382 --> 00:44:19,191
- Sorry, just a sec.
- Sure.

765
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,417
This is from Hayley's diary.

766
00:44:28,435 --> 00:44:32,808
"I hate the '80s, I hate
fancy dress, so am going as ME!!

767
00:44:32,817 --> 00:44:35,155
"They should be so lucky.
Lucky, lucky, lucky!!"

768
00:44:35,164 --> 00:44:37,520
Maybe she changed her mind.

769
00:44:38,106 --> 00:44:41,253
Were there any other female staff
going to the party

770
00:44:41,271 --> 00:44:45,511
who would have been the same age,
same build as Hayley?

771
00:44:52,071 --> 00:44:53,511
Hey.

772
00:44:54,693 --> 00:44:56,320
Hey, Fran, what's up?

773
00:44:56,346 --> 00:44:59,560
There was another employee,
same build, same colouring,

774
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:00,693
same hair as Hayley,

775
00:45:00,693 --> 00:45:03,155
who's just confirmed to me
that she went as Madonna

776
00:45:03,155 --> 00:45:05,111
and she left around 12:10.

777
00:45:05,111 --> 00:45:07,875
So you think the manager
saw her leaving, not Hayley?

778
00:45:07,884 --> 00:45:09,937
I think it has to be
a very strong possibility.

779
00:45:09,937 --> 00:45:13,182
Which means the last confirmed
sighting of Hayley was way earlier.

780
00:45:13,182 --> 00:45:16,382
At 11, after which she could
easily have bunked off work early.

781
00:45:16,391 --> 00:45:18,560
OK, this is brilliant work, Fran.

782
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:20,124
Let's talk first thing tomorrow.

783
00:45:20,133 --> 00:45:22,142
- Goodnight, boss.
- You heard that?

784
00:45:22,142 --> 00:45:24,026
So she could actually
have left the pub earlier.

785
00:45:24,026 --> 00:45:25,297
At 11.

786
00:45:25,306 --> 00:45:28,977
