1
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:03,610
This sort of mutilation
is usually done to obscure ID.

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:07,090
<font color="yellow">We think his name</font>
<font color="yellow">was Matthew Kieran Walsh.</font>

3
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:09,610
<font color="cyan">I'm so sorry, Cas, they just</font>
<font color="cyan">won't allow a medical retirement.</font>

4
00:00:09,649 --> 00:00:11,370
<font color="#008000">I think they're within their rights.</font>

5
00:00:11,409 --> 00:00:13,569
Dad, I haven't just had enough,
I've been off sick.

6
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:15,889
I told you it was rapid onset?
It was completely terrifying.

7
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:17,769
<font color="yellow">What number's this, then?</font>
<font color="cyan">My third, her first.</font>

8
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:19,050
<font color="yellow">Remind me of your age again?</font>

9
00:00:19,089 --> 00:00:22,089
<font color="#008000">Can you zip over to my brother's</font>
<font color="#008000">office tomorrow? </font><font color="yellow">Is there a problem?</font>

10
00:00:22,129 --> 00:00:23,449
<font color="#008000">Just mortgage stuff.</font>

11
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,650
<font color="cyan">I don't do that any more, Felix.</font>
<font color="cyan">You know that.</font>

12
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:27,129
<font color="cyan">How much are we even talking about?</font>

13
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:30,170
So, what have you planned today?
<font color="yellow">Wishing I was dead.</font>

14
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:33,690
<font color="cyan">Your mother can be difficult.</font>
<font color="cyan">I'm struggling with the money.</font>

15
00:00:33,729 --> 00:00:36,449
I've no idea what my dad might need
in the next year or two.

16
00:00:36,489 --> 00:00:37,690
I actually have no choice.

17
00:00:37,729 --> 00:00:39,089
<font color="yellow">The house the freezer came from</font>

18
00:00:39,129 --> 00:00:41,449
<font color="yellow">was owned by a Mr Robert Fogerty.</font>
<font color="yellow">He died two months ago.</font>

19
00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:43,409
<font color="cyan">You'll see that when Fogerty</font>
<font color="cyan">was pulled over...</font>

20
00:00:43,449 --> 00:00:45,610
There were four other people
in the car with him.

21
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:48,250
<font color="#008000">I could smell alcohol on his breath,</font>
<font color="#008000">which was when he started to cry.</font>

22
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:49,809
And the others, in the car?

23
00:00:49,849 --> 00:00:52,849
<font color="#008000">All five of them were</font>
<font color="#008000">newly qualified coppers.</font>

<font color="yellow">So, this guy knew his career</font>
<font color="yellow">was over before it had even started.</font>

26
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:49,409
So, he was obviously very upset,

27
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:52,569
but the others, have you got any
recollection what they were like?

28
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:54,209
<font color="yellow">Is there something I should know?</font>

29
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:56,970
Probably be better just to answer it
as you remember it.

30
00:01:58,929 --> 00:02:02,450
<font color="yellow">I think they were all</font>
<font color="yellow">pretty shell-shocked, to be honest.</font>

31
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:04,050
<font color="yellow">I guess they're all wondering</font>

32
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:05,890
<font color="yellow">if any of it was going</font>
<font color="yellow">to come back on them.</font>

33
00:02:05,929 --> 00:02:08,410
<font color="cyan">Do you remember if you might</font>
<font color="cyan">have taken any of their names?</font>

34
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:11,330
<font color="yellow">If I did,</font>
<font color="yellow">it would be in my pocketbook.</font>

35
00:02:14,249 --> 00:02:16,689
<font color="yellow">I do remember</font>
<font color="yellow">there was an Asian lad, though,</font>

36
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:18,450
<font color="yellow">who I had a bit of a run-in with.</font>

37
00:02:18,489 --> 00:02:19,769
<font color="cyan">What kind of run-in?</font>

38
00:02:19,809 --> 00:02:22,890
<font color="yellow">He kept on asking if there was</font>
<font color="yellow">any way we could let it go.</font>

39
00:02:22,929 --> 00:02:24,649
<font color="yellow">He got quite forceful.</font>

40
00:02:24,689 --> 00:02:28,249
<font color="yellow">In the end, I had to tell him</font>
<font color="yellow">to walk away or I'd nick him, too.</font>

41
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:30,010
<font color="cyan">Did you search the car at all?</font>

42
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,570
<font color="yellow">No, no reason to.</font>

43
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:34,170
<font color="cyan">And after you arrested Fogerty,</font>
<font color="cyan">you took him back to your nick?</font>

44
00:02:34,209 --> 00:02:36,809
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>
And what happened to the car?

45
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:38,089
<font color="yellow">One of the passengers, a girl,</font>

46
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:40,290
<font color="yellow">asked if she could</font>
<font color="yellow">drive it back to Fogerty's place.</font>

47
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:43,089
And she hadn't been drinking?
<font color="yellow">She said no.</font>

48
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:45,410
<font color="yellow">She actually offered to do a test,</font>

49
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:49,410
<font color="yellow">but I believed her,</font>
<font color="yellow">she looked like the sensible one.</font>

50
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:52,730
<font color="yellow">She seemed very keen</font>
<font color="yellow">to help him out, so I let her.</font>

51
00:02:58,369 --> 00:03:00,170
Just trying to think
how I'd have reacted,

52
00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:01,610
the day I finished basic training,

53
00:03:01,649 --> 00:03:03,929
if my mate had got pulled over
with a dead body in the boot.

54
00:03:04,969 --> 00:03:07,489
<font color="cyan">Well, it'd be in the shell-shocked</font>
<font color="cyan">territory, wouldn't it?</font>

55
00:03:07,529 --> 00:03:09,050
Hm. Just a bit.

56
00:03:09,089 --> 00:03:12,529
<font color="cyan">Although, boss,</font>
<font color="cyan">we don't actually know for sure</font>

57
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:14,730
<font color="cyan">Walsh was in the boot</font>
<font color="cyan">at this stage, so...</font>

58
00:03:14,769 --> 00:03:16,130
I need to speak to Andrews.

59
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:18,890
<font color="cyan">Maybe we should wait until...?</font>
We need to find the complete file.

60
00:03:18,929 --> 00:03:21,529
I wanna know
who those passengers were

61
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:24,730
and if any of them are still serving
coppers because, if they are...

62
00:03:27,369 --> 00:03:28,929
..that's gonna be very interesting.

63
00:03:36,809 --> 00:03:38,369
I'm too bloody old.

64
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:39,730
You're too bloody old.

65
00:03:39,769 --> 00:03:41,610
<font color="yellow">It's 7:14...</font>

66
00:03:41,649 --> 00:03:43,249
I've been getting up at 6:15
for 30 years,

67
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:44,330
so do me a favour, will you?

68
00:03:44,369 --> 00:03:48,170
Get up and go find a job,
because we are selling this house

69
00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:52,410
and, in a few months,
you will be homeless.

70
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:53,570
Have a nice day.

71
00:03:59,809 --> 00:04:01,529
Sorry.
<font color="cyan">It's fine.</font>

72
00:04:03,489 --> 00:04:04,969
I just don't have space in my life

73
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:08,209
to be still washing his cacky pants
and doing his sodding dishes.

74
00:04:08,249 --> 00:04:09,809
He's an adult, for Christ sakes!

75
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,089
<font color="cyan">Absolutely.</font>

76
00:04:14,089 --> 00:04:16,290
<font color="cyan">So, you gonna</font>
<font color="cyan">speak to your dad today?</font>

77
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:19,889
Oh, I think I have to wait
until I'm summoned, don't I?

78
00:04:19,929 --> 00:04:21,249
<font color="cyan">Do you? He's your dad.</font>

79
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:23,730
Hm, I guess.

80
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:28,530
I just don't want to incur
the 'Wrath of Jen'.

81
00:04:28,569 --> 00:04:29,850
HE LAUGHS

82
00:04:29,889 --> 00:04:32,610
<font color="cyan">Oh, I think you give her</font>
<font color="cyan">a run for her money.</font>

83
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:36,970
<font color="cyan">Right, I'll speak to you later,</font>
<font color="cyan">I'll let you know how it went.</font>

84
00:04:37,009 --> 00:04:40,210
Oh, God, sorry. Course, good luck.
<font color="cyan">Thanks.</font>

85
00:04:41,569 --> 00:04:42,809
<font color="cyan">Have a good day.</font>

86
00:04:46,009 --> 00:04:47,009
John?

87
00:04:49,249 --> 00:04:50,689
Do I seem angry all the time?

88
00:04:53,009 --> 00:04:54,449
<font color="cyan">Not all the time, no.</font>

89
00:04:57,129 --> 00:04:58,449
I'm sorry.

90
00:04:58,489 --> 00:05:00,129
<font color="cyan">It's all good.</font>

91
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:02,929
<font color="cyan">I'll see you later. Love you.</font>

92
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:18,569
<font color="yellow">Why does it keep sounding</font>
<font color="yellow">like you're about to say a 'but'?</font>

93
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:21,129
<font color="yellow">Ram?</font>

94
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:22,569
OK.

95
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:25,210
But...

96
00:05:27,689 --> 00:05:30,650
Why do we need a blood test?
<font color="yellow">Because the ultrasound on its own</font>

97
00:05:30,689 --> 00:05:33,730
<font color="yellow">is not accurate enough to warrant</font>
<font color="yellow">the risk of an amniocentesis.</font>

98
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:40,889
But... why would we want either
a blood test or an amnio?

99
00:05:40,929 --> 00:05:43,210
<font color="yellow">So we can make a decision, love,</font>
<font color="yellow">about what to do.</font>

100
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:46,929
<font color="yellow">Yes?</font>

101
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:51,369
I'm so late...

102
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:53,689
<font color="yellow">Ram, we need to talk about this.</font>

103
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:56,929
I didn't sleep a wink last night,
so I'm not making any sense.

104
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:58,850
We'll talk tonight, I promise.

105
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:01,650
I love you.

106
00:06:10,809 --> 00:06:15,369
<font color="yellow">Ready? I need to leave.</font>
<font color="yellow">Sam, move it, please. </font><font color="cyan">Why?</font>

107
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:19,689
Oh, I might be back
a bit late tonight.

108
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:22,809
I've got no pm sessions,
so I'm gonna go for a run,

109
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:25,210
work some of this stress off
up in the hills.

110
00:06:25,249 --> 00:06:28,449
<font color="yellow">Sure. But, really,</font>
<font color="yellow">there's nothing to worry about,</font>

111
00:06:28,489 --> 00:06:32,249
<font color="yellow">everything's going to be</font>
<font color="yellow">absolutely fine. </font><font color="cyan">Dad, we're late!</font>

112
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:34,410
<font color="yellow">OK, come on, guys.</font>

113
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:37,530
PHONE RINGS

Who's Lucy Myers?

<font color="yellow">'That temp from HR. She was sat</font>

Oh, yeah, her. No story, why?

119
00:06:49,689 --> 00:06:51,889
<font color="yellow">She's been saying</font>
<font color="yellow">you were inappropriate with her.</font>

120
00:06:51,929 --> 00:06:53,770

129
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:43,009
<font color="cyan">Well, to me, it looked like</font>
<font color="cyan">they missed quite a lot,</font>

130
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:44,730
<font color="cyan">possible wits</font>

<font color="cyan">he was lying low for a bit.</font>

136
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:00,809
<font color="cyan">Anyway, Fran's gonna go through</font>
<font color="cyan">them all in detail.</font>

137
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:03,090
<font color="cyan">I'm gonna see if I can find</font>
<font color="cyan">the traffic offence files.</font>

138
00:08:03,129 --> 00:08:04,489
<font color="cyan">I'll call you.</font>

139
00:08:06,329 --> 00:08:10,050
Oh, and, sorry, where are we
on locating next of kin?

140
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,410
<font color="cyan">Murray's on it.</font>

141
00:08:21,449 --> 00:08:22,929
<font color="yellow">Enjoy your run.</font>

142
00:08:25,449 --> 00:08:26,730
Thanks, Belle.

143
00:08:30,929 --> 00:08:32,130
DOOR LOCK BEEPS

144
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:40,010
<font color="yellow">So, I spoke to a neighbour</font>
<font color="yellow">at his last known address</font>

145
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:43,250
<font color="yellow">and she said that both parents</font>
<font color="yellow">are now dead. </font>OK.

146
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:45,449
<font color="yellow">He had an older brother,</font>
<font color="yellow">name of Clive,</font>

147
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:48,650
<font color="yellow">who she thinks is still alive,</font>
<font color="yellow">but the interesting thing is,</font>

148
00:08:48,689 --> 00:08:51,410
<font color="yellow">Matthew's girlfriend, Karen,</font>
<font color="yellow">was pregnant when he went missing.</font>

149
00:08:51,449 --> 00:08:53,050
And she had the baby?

150
00:08:53,089 --> 00:08:55,329
<font color="yellow">She did, name of Jerome.</font>

151
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:57,370
And where's Karen now?

152
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:59,209
<font color="yellow">Also dead,</font>
<font color="yellow">according to the neighbour.</font>

153
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,130
<font color="yellow">Heroin overdose, about 15 years ago.</font>

154
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:02,929
There's a lot
of premature deaths here.

155
00:09:02,969 --> 00:09:05,410
The mum, the dad, Karen...

156
00:09:05,449 --> 00:09:08,929
Was this as a result of Matthew's
disappearance, do we think?

157
00:09:08,969 --> 00:09:11,490
<font color="yellow">Some of it, I'd say,</font>
<font color="yellow">but, to be honest,</font>

158
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:13,689
<font color="yellow">it sounds like they were</font>
<font color="yellow">a pretty troubled family</font>

159
00:09:13,729 --> 00:09:15,929
<font color="yellow">before he disappeared,</font>
<font color="yellow">lot of drug and alcohol and issues.</font>

160
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:18,329
May I?

161
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:24,650
PHONE RINGS

162
00:09:28,849 --> 00:09:30,250
<font color="cyan">Hello?</font>

163
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:31,849
ON PHONE: 'Ah, hello,
is that Jerome?'

164
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:33,130
<font color="cyan">Speaking.</font>

165
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:38,130
Oh, hi, erm,
my name is Cassie Stuart.

166
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:42,849
I'm a police officer and I was
wondering if you had five minutes

167
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:46,170
'to talk about your father,
about Matthew Walsh?'

168
00:09:46,209 --> 00:09:47,490
<font color="cyan">What about him?</font>

169
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:53,329
Jerome, I'm very sorry
to have to tell you this, but...

170
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:56,809
we think
there's a pretty good chance

171
00:09:56,849 --> 00:09:58,969
we might have found his remains.

172
00:10:01,929 --> 00:10:03,089
'Hello?'

173
00:10:04,809 --> 00:10:07,089
<font color="cyan">Yeah, look, er, this, er...</font>
<font color="cyan">This isn't a very good time,</font>

174
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:08,170
<font color="cyan">I'm on a job at the moment,</font>

175
00:10:08,209 --> 00:10:10,130
<font color="cyan">could you call me back</font>
<font color="cyan">outside of work hours?</font>

176
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:12,530
Er, yeah, absolutely.

177
00:10:12,569 --> 00:10:17,370
Or I could come
and talk to you in person.

178
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:18,969
Whatever works best for you.

179
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:22,689
<font color="cyan">Yeah. Look, you've got my number,</font>
<font color="cyan">erm, just text me some times</font>

180
00:10:22,729 --> 00:10:24,250
<font color="cyan">and I'll get back to you.</font>

181
00:10:35,444 --> 00:10:36,844
<font color="cyan">Thank you.</font>

182
00:12:06,324 --> 00:12:07,365
It's Dean.

183
00:12:09,844 --> 00:12:10,844
Yeah...

184
00:12:12,844 --> 00:12:14,084
Can I give you a reg?

185
00:12:16,724 --> 00:12:19,444
Just the usual.
Plus five for inflation.

186
00:12:22,604 --> 00:12:24,804
OK, it's a white Citroen Dispatch.

187
00:12:32,925 --> 00:12:34,885
CAR HORN SOUNDS
<font color="yellow">Are you gonna argue?!</font>

188
00:12:34,925 --> 00:12:36,365
THEY SHOUT AND ARGUE

189
00:12:42,045 --> 00:12:43,765
<font color="cyan">Stop! Argh!</font>

190
00:12:45,844 --> 00:12:47,165
<font color="#008000">Did you see that?!</font>

191
00:12:47,204 --> 00:12:48,645
SHE MOANS

192
00:13:34,084 --> 00:13:37,765
The driver had blue jeans,
black trainers and a grey top.

193
00:13:37,804 --> 00:13:39,765
<font color="yellow">I don't suppose you got</font>
<font color="yellow">the index of the moped?</font>

194
00:13:39,804 --> 00:13:43,844
Er, Foxtrot Juliet Zero Eight
Tango Victor Uniform.

195
00:13:43,885 --> 00:13:46,045
Am I good to go, Brendan?
<font color="cyan">So, no dizziness,</font>

196
00:13:46,084 --> 00:13:48,484
<font color="cyan">no blurred vision, no nausea?</font>
None, I'm good.

197
00:13:48,525 --> 00:13:51,005
<font color="cyan">Well, I'd prefer</font>
<font color="cyan">to take you back to the hospital...</font>

198
00:13:51,045 --> 00:13:54,005
I totally understand,
but I feel fine.

199
00:13:54,045 --> 00:13:55,564
And thank you, PC Robson.

200
00:13:55,604 --> 00:13:58,844
And I'll get my PA to send
a statement over later. <font color="yellow">Ma'am.</font>

201
00:14:16,684 --> 00:14:19,365
<font color="cyan">DVLA have the car, a Ford Granada,</font>

202
00:14:19,405 --> 00:14:22,405
<font color="cyan">being sold by Fogerty in 1991</font>

203
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:26,444
<font color="cyan">and the new keeper notified</font>
<font color="cyan">the vehicle as off road in 2002,</font>

204
00:14:26,484 --> 00:14:28,245
<font color="cyan">when it was sold for scrap.</font>

205
00:14:29,564 --> 00:14:31,564
OK, thanks. Jake?

206
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:36,684
<font color="yellow">So, we've opened pretty much every</font>
<font color="yellow">wardrobe, cupboard, box, drawer,</font>

207
00:14:36,724 --> 00:14:39,645
<font color="yellow">anything that could contain</font>
<font color="yellow">body parts, and there's nothing.</font>

208
00:14:39,684 --> 00:14:43,885
<font color="yellow">Now, obviously, he could've disposed</font>
<font color="yellow">of these parts 30 years ago,</font>

209
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:47,684
<font color="yellow">but my guess is, logic-wise,</font>
<font color="yellow">the head and the hands,</font>

210
00:14:47,724 --> 00:14:51,484
<font color="yellow">the easiest to identify,</font>
<font color="yellow">are the last parts you'd get rid of.</font>

211
00:14:51,525 --> 00:14:54,964
Agreed.
<font color="yellow">OK, so, working on the assumption,</font>

212
00:14:55,005 --> 00:14:56,604
<font color="yellow">and for whatever reason,</font>

213
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:58,925
<font color="yellow">he never actually disposed</font>
<font color="yellow">of any part of the body,</font>

214
00:14:58,964 --> 00:15:01,645
<font color="yellow">should we be looking in his effects</font>

215
00:15:01,684 --> 00:15:04,204
<font color="yellow">for evidence</font>
<font color="yellow">of some storage facility somewhere?</font>

216
00:15:04,245 --> 00:15:06,804
You mean like a garage,
or a lockup, or something?

217
00:15:06,844 --> 00:15:08,365
<font color="yellow">Yeah, exactly.</font>
Good idea.

218
00:15:08,405 --> 00:15:12,604
In fact, any other buildings that
he might have had access to, yeah.

219
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:14,365
Fran?

220
00:15:14,405 --> 00:15:18,125
<font color="#008000">Yes. Still working my way through</font>
<font color="#008000">the original witness statements.</font>

221
00:15:18,165 --> 00:15:20,604
<font color="#008000">The wit detailed as being</font>
<font color="#008000">the last confirmed sighting of him</font>

222
00:15:20,645 --> 00:15:22,804
<font color="#008000">has sadly died,</font>
<font color="#008000">but I have managed to make contact</font>

223
00:15:22,844 --> 00:15:26,125
<font color="#008000">with a Viv Hancock today</font>
<font color="#008000">- seeing her tomorrow -</font>

224
00:15:26,165 --> 00:15:29,405
<font color="#008000">who was also detailed</font>
<font color="#008000">as having seen Walsh that night.</font>

225
00:15:29,444 --> 00:15:31,604
<font color="#008000">Although there's no actual statement</font>
<font color="#008000">in the files.</font>

226
00:15:31,645 --> 00:15:32,844
Just lost or...?

227
00:15:32,885 --> 00:15:35,724
<font color="#008000">Well, she told me today no formal</font>
<font color="#008000">statement was ever actually taken.</font>

228
00:15:35,765 --> 00:15:38,125
Ah. OK, so, just human error?

229
00:15:38,165 --> 00:15:39,724
<font color="#008000">Er, I guess.</font>

230
00:15:39,765 --> 00:15:41,964
Well, let me know
when you've spoken to her.

231
00:15:42,005 --> 00:15:43,844
So, what else, er...

232
00:15:45,165 --> 00:15:49,844
Oh, yeah, the victim's clothes
have gone to a forensic botanist.

233
00:15:49,885 --> 00:15:51,324
Leanne Balcombe thought there were

234
00:15:51,365 --> 00:15:55,405
some interesting plant remains
caught on his T-shirt.

235
00:15:55,444 --> 00:15:58,444
DI Khan is at the records archive

236
00:15:58,484 --> 00:16:01,165
and I'm off now
to meet with the victim's son.

237
00:16:03,484 --> 00:16:06,045
OK, that's it for now.

238
00:16:08,045 --> 00:16:10,444
<font color="yellow">Good to have you back, Guv.</font>
<font color="cyan">Seconded. </font><font color="#008000">Thirded.</font>

239
00:16:13,285 --> 00:16:16,724
Thank you, guys. Appreciated.

240
00:16:21,964 --> 00:16:23,285
How'd you get on?

241
00:16:23,324 --> 00:16:25,844
<font color="yellow">In that car with Fogerty</font>
<font color="yellow">were four police probationers</font>

242
00:16:25,885 --> 00:16:30,084
<font color="yellow">going by the names of Dean,</font>
<font color="yellow">Fiona, Liz and Ram.</font>

243
00:16:33,765 --> 00:16:35,645
Come...

244
00:16:35,684 --> 00:16:39,684
Ah, DCI Sidhu. Please, have a seat.

245
00:16:40,925 --> 00:16:42,684
So, Lucy Myers...

246
00:16:45,285 --> 00:16:47,285
I've spoken to Lucy and she says

247
00:16:47,324 --> 00:16:49,484
that you put your arm
around her waist,

248
00:16:49,525 --> 00:16:53,925
made a number of lewd comments,
patted her behind,

249
00:16:53,964 --> 00:16:56,804
and generally
made her feel uncomfortable.

250
00:16:56,844 --> 00:16:57,964
<font color="yellow">Didn't happen.</font>

251
00:16:58,005 --> 00:17:00,484
Right. Well, I have to say,
I did see you...

252
00:17:00,525 --> 00:17:03,325
<font color="yellow">Saw me, what? Enjoying someone's</font>
<font color="yellow">company? Not illegal, is it?</font>

253
00:17:03,365 --> 00:17:06,125
No, but there's... <font color="yellow">If anything,</font>
<font color="yellow">she was the who flirted with me.</font>

254
00:17:06,165 --> 00:17:07,204
Well, that is not...

255
00:17:07,244 --> 00:17:09,565
<font color="yellow">Can we cut to the chase,</font>
<font color="yellow">Sir, what's she gonna do?</font>

256
00:17:10,645 --> 00:17:12,085
She's not decided yet.

257
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:14,284
<font color="yellow">But she might</font>
<font color="yellow">make a formal complaint?</font>

258
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:16,805
She might, yes,
she's still thinking about it.

259
00:17:16,845 --> 00:17:19,165
<font color="yellow">But you haven't gone</font>
<font color="yellow">to Professional Standards yet?</font>

260
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,444
No, not yet.

261
00:17:20,484 --> 00:17:23,565
<font color="yellow">Well, I think we both know</font>
<font color="yellow">what this is really about.</font>

262
00:17:23,605 --> 00:17:25,204
Do we?

263
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:27,524
<font color="yellow">It's racially motivated.</font>

264
00:17:27,565 --> 00:17:29,845
Where do you get that from?

265
00:17:29,885 --> 00:17:32,244
<font color="yellow">She flirted with the Paki,</font>
<font color="yellow">she came on to the Paki,</font>

266
00:17:32,284 --> 00:17:35,764
<font color="yellow">but the Paki turned her down,</font>
<font color="yellow">and she didn't like it. </font>Hang on...

267
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:38,405
<font color="yellow">So I suggest you have</font>
<font color="yellow">another word with her, Sir,</font>

268
00:17:38,444 --> 00:17:40,325
<font color="yellow">to discourage her</font>
<font color="yellow">from taking this forward,</font>

269
00:17:40,365 --> 00:17:41,365
<font color="yellow">otherwise I and the BPA</font>

270
00:17:41,405 --> 00:17:44,004
<font color="yellow">will bring Arma-fucking-geddon</font>
<font color="yellow">down on the pair of you.</font>

271
00:17:54,484 --> 00:17:55,845
SHE KNOCKS ON DOOR

272
00:18:00,885 --> 00:18:03,805
<font color="yellow">Where did you want me</font>
<font color="yellow">to put these, Mrs Baildon?</font>

273
00:18:03,845 --> 00:18:07,204
<font color="yellow">Liz dropped them in this morning,</font>
<font color="yellow">for Mother's Day.</font>

274
00:18:07,244 --> 00:18:08,605
<font color="cyan">The bin.</font>

275
00:18:08,645 --> 00:18:10,004
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry?</font>

276
00:18:10,044 --> 00:18:15,165
<font color="cyan">If she thinks I'm only worth</font>
<font color="cyan">a-day-late petrol station flowers,</font>

277
00:18:15,204 --> 00:18:17,605
<font color="cyan">then I'd really rather</font>
<font color="cyan">she didn't bother.</font>

278
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:26,605
<font color="cyan">Oh, you think butter wouldn't melt,</font>
<font color="cyan">don't you, Eugenia?</font>

279
00:18:26,645 --> 00:18:30,925
<font color="cyan">Well, I could tell you a thing</font>
<font color="cyan">or two about our Elizabeth</font>

280
00:18:30,964 --> 00:18:33,605
<font color="cyan">that would make your hair turn grey.</font>

281
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:44,419
<font color="yellow">You've been in the wars, we hear?</font>
<font color="cyan">Like I was going to win that one!</font>

282
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,659
<font color="yellow">Well, genuinely,</font>
<font color="yellow">thank you for not cancelling today,</font>

283
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,859
<font color="yellow">we all appreciate it.</font>
<font color="cyan">You're welcome.</font>

284
00:18:48,899 --> 00:18:52,579
<font color="cyan">I know how hard it is</font>
<font color="cyan">to get everyone in the same room.</font>

285
00:18:52,619 --> 00:18:54,099
<font color="yellow">Is it OK if we dive straight in?</font>

286
00:18:54,139 --> 00:18:55,619
<font color="cyan">Of course. Yes. Erm...</font>

287
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:05,780
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

288
00:19:08,099 --> 00:19:10,260
<font color="yellow">I wonder, then,</font>
<font color="yellow">if we could start, Elizabeth,</font>

289
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:14,940
<font color="yellow">by you giving us a potted history,</font>
<font color="yellow">as it were, of your career to date?</font>

290
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:19,659
<font color="yellow">Just be useful to hear a bit about,</font>
<font color="yellow">well, where you've come from.</font>

291
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,980
<font color="cyan">Absolutely.</font>

292
00:19:22,419 --> 00:19:23,619
<font color="cyan">Well...</font>

293
00:19:25,619 --> 00:19:28,500
<font color="cyan">I think it's fair to say</font>
<font color="cyan">that when I told my parents</font>

294
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:30,020
<font color="cyan">I wanted to be a police officer,</font>

295
00:19:30,059 --> 00:19:31,619
<font color="cyan">they could not</font>
<font color="cyan">have been less pleased.</font>

296
00:19:31,659 --> 00:19:34,379
<font color="cyan">I'd just completed</font>
<font color="cyan">a classics degree at Balliol,</font>

297
00:19:34,419 --> 00:19:39,780
<font color="cyan">so it wasn't quite what they were</font>
<font color="cyan">expecting me to do next.</font>

298
00:19:39,819 --> 00:19:42,859
<font color="cyan">..working as a constable in Walsall</font>
<font color="cyan">for three years</font>

299
00:19:42,899 --> 00:19:47,059
<font color="cyan">was a total eye-opener for me.</font>

300
00:19:47,099 --> 00:19:49,619
<font color="cyan">I'd come from</font>
<font color="cyan">a privileged background...</font>

301
00:19:49,659 --> 00:19:52,180
<font color="cyan">..I would love to improve the</font>
<font color="cyan">public's perception of who we are.</font>

302
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:55,180
<font color="cyan">I would love them</font>
<font color="cyan">to see past the uniform.</font>

303
00:19:56,859 --> 00:20:00,540
<font color="cyan">..I almost think somehow</font>
<font color="cyan">we've become the enemy...</font>

304
00:20:02,419 --> 00:20:05,419
<font color="cyan">..part of my job is</font>
<font color="cyan">to make my fellow officers</font>

305
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,899
<font color="cyan">feel proud to do what they do.</font>

306
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:11,740
<font color="cyan">Because I genuinely think</font>
<font color="cyan">they should feel proud, hugely so.</font>

307
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,980
<font color="cyan">For not the biggest salary</font>
<font color="cyan">in the world,</font>

308
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:16,740
<font color="cyan">they risk their lives</font>
<font color="cyan">on a daily basis.</font>

309
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:20,139
<font color="cyan">They walk toward danger</font>
<font color="cyan">on a daily basis.</font>

310
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:24,139
<font color="cyan">They protect and serve</font>
<font color="cyan">and help the British public,</font>

311
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:27,899
<font color="cyan">on a daily basis. Now, I think</font>
<font color="cyan">that's pretty damn impressive</font>

312
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:30,780
<font color="cyan">and I think</font>
<font color="cyan">it's a key part of my job</font>

313
00:20:30,819 --> 00:20:34,099
<font color="cyan">to remind</font>
<font color="cyan">the British public of that.</font>

314
00:20:34,139 --> 00:20:37,780
<font color="cyan">On a daily basis, if needs be.</font>

315
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:40,020
THEY CHUCKLE

316
00:20:40,059 --> 00:20:42,619
<font color="yellow">Well, thank you, Elizabeth,</font>
<font color="yellow">that was most impressive.</font>

317
00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:44,500
<font color="cyan">Thank you.</font>
<font color="#008000">Here-here.</font>

318
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,460
Jerome?

319
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,619
<font color="yellow">Hi.</font>

320
00:21:10,059 --> 00:21:12,220
Cassie Stuart. Nice to meet you.

321
00:21:13,419 --> 00:21:16,099
<font color="yellow">I've unblocked three toilets today,</font>
<font color="yellow">so I wouldn't, if I were you.</font>

322
00:21:16,139 --> 00:21:18,379
Ah...
<font color="yellow">Come on in.</font>

323
00:21:21,819 --> 00:21:25,099
<font color="yellow">I obviously never met him,</font>
<font color="yellow">nor did I meet my grandparents,</font>

324
00:21:25,139 --> 00:21:28,540
<font color="yellow">cos they led pretty chaotic lives.</font>

325
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:32,020
<font color="yellow">Drink and drugs</font>
<font color="yellow">and all that sort of crap.</font>

326
00:21:35,619 --> 00:21:38,579
<font color="yellow">His girlfriend, my mum,</font>
<font color="yellow">had similar problems</font>

327
00:21:38,619 --> 00:21:40,099
<font color="yellow">and died when I was seven,</font>

328
00:21:40,139 --> 00:21:42,540
<font color="yellow">which meant</font>
<font color="yellow">I was mainly raised in care, so...</font>

329
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,859
<font color="yellow">..I just don't feel any...</font>

330
00:21:47,899 --> 00:21:50,379
<font color="yellow">serious emotional connection to him.</font>

331
00:21:50,419 --> 00:21:55,419
Of course. <font color="yellow">I also have a wife</font>
<font color="yellow">and a little one of my own and...</font>

332
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:03,619
<font color="yellow">His life was just so messed up</font>
<font color="yellow">and tragic and...</font>

333
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:08,819
<font color="yellow">..dirty. I just don't want</font>
<font color="yellow">any of that, kind of,</font>

334
00:22:08,859 --> 00:22:10,180
<font color="yellow">infecting my family now.</font>

335
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:12,379
<font color="yellow">Does that make any sense?</font>
Absolutely.

336
00:22:12,419 --> 00:22:15,460
<font color="yellow">I mean, if you need me to give you</font>
<font color="yellow">a DNA swab, to help identify him,</font>

337
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,579
<font color="yellow">I'm more than happy to do that,</font>
<font color="yellow">but that's about it, really.</font>

338
00:22:18,619 --> 00:22:20,899
No, I completely understand.

339
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:23,220
And thank you for that,
the DNA thing,

340
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,859
that would be very useful.

341
00:22:24,899 --> 00:22:29,619
I am gonna be cheeky
and ask one question, if I may?

342
00:22:29,659 --> 00:22:31,260
<font color="yellow">Go on.</font>

343
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:34,139
So, our files say that at the time
of his disappearance,

344
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:36,819
your father was living
with his older brother, Clive,

345
00:22:36,859 --> 00:22:39,339
in a squat in north London.

346
00:22:39,379 --> 00:22:43,579
And we believe Clive was the
last person who actually knew him,

347
00:22:43,619 --> 00:22:45,619
to see him alive,
so we'd love to speak to him.

348
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:49,940
And we just wondered
if you had any contact details?

349
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:53,540
Or even if you knew
if he was still alive?

350
00:22:53,579 --> 00:22:57,619
<font color="yellow">Clive actually used to send me</font>
<font color="yellow">Christmas cards up until about...</font>

351
00:22:57,659 --> 00:22:59,780
<font color="yellow">four, five years ago?</font>

352
00:22:59,819 --> 00:23:02,300
<font color="yellow">I think I kept them somewhere.</font>
<font color="yellow">They might have an address on them.</font>

353
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:10,579
<font color="yellow">I'll have a look at home,</font>
<font color="yellow">see what I can find.</font>

354
00:23:10,619 --> 00:23:14,059
I'd really appreciate it. Thank you.

355
00:23:16,059 --> 00:23:17,540
<font color="cyan">So, what are you gonna do?</font>

356
00:23:17,579 --> 00:23:19,740
<font color="yellow">About the woman or the baby?</font>

357
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:22,139
<font color="cyan">Both? Either?</font>

358
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:23,940
<font color="yellow">The woman,</font>
<font color="yellow">I'll wait and see what she does.</font>

359
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:26,139
<font color="yellow">If she makes it formal,</font>
<font color="yellow">I'll fucking destroy her.</font>

360
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:34,419
<font color="cyan">And you haven't considered,</font>
<font color="cyan">this time, maybe just....</font>

361
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:37,180
<font color="cyan">speaking to her?</font>
<font color="cyan">Maybe apologising?</font>

362
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,700
<font color="yellow">For what, being the wrong colour?</font>

363
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:41,300
<font color="cyan">And you're 100% sure</font>
<font color="cyan">this is about colour?</font>

364
00:23:41,339 --> 00:23:45,659
<font color="cyan">It couldn't just be two pissed</font>
<font color="cyan">people getting it slightly wrong?</font>

365
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,859
<font color="yellow">Mm-mm, no.</font>
<font color="cyan">Mate...</font>

366
00:23:47,899 --> 00:23:50,700
<font color="yellow">Bal... Trust me.</font>

367
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:53,419
<font color="yellow">When you've had 30 years</font>
<font color="yellow">of what I have,</font>

368
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:58,059
<font color="yellow">30 years of shit jokes</font>
<font color="yellow">about corner shops and Gandhi,</font>

369
00:23:58,099 --> 00:24:00,859
<font color="yellow">to having to fight twice as hard</font>
<font color="yellow">for every promotion,</font>

370
00:24:00,899 --> 00:24:04,180
<font color="yellow">of having to fend off a million</font>
<font color="yellow">attempts to basically get rid of me,</font>

371
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:06,940
<font color="yellow">then you'll know what it's about,</font>
<font color="yellow">what it's always about.</font>

372
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:09,339
<font color="cyan">Well, I admire you, I do,</font>

373
00:24:09,379 --> 00:24:13,300
<font color="cyan">cos how you have managed to remain</font>
<font color="cyan">so pissed off, for so many years...</font>

374
00:24:13,339 --> 00:24:15,220
<font color="yellow">Oh, it's easy, bruv.</font>

375
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:17,940
<font color="yellow">I just look at you and dad and think</font>
<font color="yellow">I never wanna end up like that.</font>

376
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:19,619
<font color="cyan">What, happy?</font>

377
00:24:19,659 --> 00:24:21,419
<font color="yellow">Accepting...</font>

378
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:24,020
<font color="yellow">of things that aren't right,</font>
<font color="yellow">just cos,</font>

379
00:24:24,059 --> 00:24:26,819
<font color="yellow">"That's the way it's always been."</font>

380
00:24:26,859 --> 00:24:29,780
<font color="yellow">You don't get anywhere in this world</font>
<font color="yellow">without fighting, mate.</font>

381
00:24:29,819 --> 00:24:31,980
<font color="yellow">And if I piss people off</font>
<font color="yellow">along the way, good,</font>

382
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:34,139
<font color="yellow">I'm doing something right.</font>

383
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:36,300
<font color="cyan">You've done a lot right, then.</font>

384
00:24:36,339 --> 00:24:38,500
THEY LAUGH

385
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:43,500
<font color="yellow">And by the way, I am happy. Very.</font>
<font color="cyan">Well, I hope so, I do.</font>

386
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:46,460
<font color="cyan">Cos you give a very good impression</font>
<font color="cyan">of being a bloke</font>

387
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:49,059
<font color="cyan">who's still trying</font>
<font color="cyan">to prove something.</font>

388
00:24:49,099 --> 00:24:52,220
<font color="cyan">Which is a shame, cos all we've</font>
<font color="cyan">ever been is dead proud of you.</font>

389
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:57,579
<font color="yellow">Hm, well, maybe tell</font>
<font color="yellow">the old man that one day.</font>

390
00:24:57,619 --> 00:25:00,500
<font color="cyan">Mate, you and him are</font>
<font color="cyan">more similar than you think.</font>

391
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,379
<font color="yellow">Please, God, no.</font>

392
00:25:02,419 --> 00:25:07,139
<font color="cyan">He just wants the same as you, bro,</font>
<font color="cyan">a little respect.</font>

393
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:11,379
<font color="cyan">Now, go home and talk to your wife,</font>
<font color="cyan">that is so much more important.</font>

394
00:25:11,419 --> 00:25:13,379
<font color="cyan">I love you, man.</font>

395
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:16,500

<font color="yellow">'I want to change it.'</font>

397
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,659
Right. It's fine.

398
00:25:24,859 --> 00:25:25,859
To what?

399
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:29,180
<font color="yellow">I want my half of the house</font>
<font color="yellow">to go to Jenny.</font>

400
00:25:31,819 --> 00:25:32,819
OK.

401
00:25:34,899 --> 00:25:37,740
So, you remember you always said
you wanted that to go to the kids...

402
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:40,619
<font color="yellow">Please don't patronise me, Cass.</font>
I'm not, I'm just...

403
00:25:40,659 --> 00:25:42,819
<font color="yellow">I remember perfectly well.</font>

404
00:25:42,859 --> 00:25:43,899
Fine.

405
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:48,099
<font color="yellow">But the boys are spoilt,</font>
<font color="yellow">you said so yourself. </font>Did I?

406
00:25:48,139 --> 00:25:49,819
<font color="yellow">They need to earn their own money.</font>

407
00:25:49,859 --> 00:25:52,339
<font color="yellow">They need to go out there</font>
<font color="yellow">and get themselves a job,</font>

408
00:25:52,379 --> 00:25:54,540
<font color="yellow">and giving them</font>
<font color="yellow">a great big lump sum in the...</font>

409
00:25:54,579 --> 00:25:56,419
It was never gonna work like that,
Dad.

SHE TUTS

411
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:04,260
Your will says that,
in the event of your death...

412
00:26:05,899 --> 00:26:08,700
..your equity stayed in the house
till I sell,

413
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:13,419
and then, uh, it goes into a trust
for them until they're 35.

414
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:16,020
Precisely because...
neither of us thought

415
00:26:16,059 --> 00:26:18,339
it was good for them
to get a lump sum too young.

416
00:26:18,379 --> 00:26:19,379
We...

417
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:23,419
We worked it all through
very carefully,

418
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:25,619
as soon as you were diagnosed,
if you remember.

419
00:26:28,859 --> 00:26:31,020
Of course it's your choice,
I'm just...

420
00:26:33,379 --> 00:26:35,540
..I'm not sure
what's made you change your mind.

421
00:26:35,579 --> 00:26:37,859
FOOTSTEPS, DOOR OPENS

422
00:26:37,899 --> 00:26:39,859
<font color="cyan">Anyone need another cuppa?</font>

423
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:45,500
<font color="cyan">What are you implying?</font>

424
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:49,540
Nothing.
It's a completely genuine question.

425
00:26:49,579 --> 00:26:51,339
Do you know what
he's planning to do?

426
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:54,859
<font color="cyan">No, I have no idea.</font>

427
00:26:54,899 --> 00:26:56,419
<font color="cyan">We haven't discussed it.</font>

428
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:58,700
<font color="cyan">It's his will,</font>
<font color="cyan">it's entirely his business.</font>

429
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:01,899
And don't you think you should
discuss it, given his condition?

430
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:02,940
SCOFFS

431
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:06,099
<font color="cyan">Maybe. But I suspect you'd have</font>
<font color="cyan">something to say about it if I did.</font>

432
00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:11,059
<font color="cyan">This isn't what I wanted, Cassie.</font>

433
00:27:11,099 --> 00:27:14,500

<font color="yellow">So, how was your day?</font>

438
00:27:39,619 --> 00:27:41,220
<font color="yellow">How are we for Wednesday?</font>

439

<font color="yellow">You getting any real work done?</font>

440
00:27:42,899 --> 00:27:46,460
Fundraising feels a lot realer
than importing air con systems.

441
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,139
<font color="yellow">Are we on target?</font>
I think so.

442
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:50,540
We might even exceed it.
<font color="yellow">Serious?</font>

443
00:27:50,579 --> 00:27:53,899
I think we're in with a shout
of raising 110.

Still got two tables left to sell.

<font color="yellow">You are such a star.</font>

00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:09,419
<font color="yellow">I don't know how you do it,</font>
<font color="yellow">honestly.</font>

451
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:12,460
<font color="yellow">And let ME make some phone calls</font>

Oh, no worries, babe.

<font color="cyan">Yeah, right.</font>

463
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:55,619
Maybe take him out for a beer,

464
00:28:55,659 --> 00:28:58,579
try and get a sense of whether
she is manipulating him or not.

465
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:04,020
<font color="#008000">I think that's a really bad idea.</font>

Why?

467
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:09,980
<font color="#008000">I mean, take him out for a beer</font>
<font color="#008000">cos it's a nice thing to do,</font>

468
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:12,980

She's known him less than 18 months,
John.

473
00:29:21,859 --> 00:29:24,220
There's no WAY he'd do this
if he was in his right mind.

Listen, ah, I did what I could,
I promise you.

But she's just called me from home

00:40:24,774 --> 00:40:27,455
Where?
<font color="yellow">Twickenham.</font>

606
00:40:27,495 --> 00:40:30,055
<font color="yellow">Like yourself, he's a DCI,</font>

00:40:36,134 --> 00:40:38,694

Right now, maybe,
but it won't be, trust me.

00:42:24,935 --> 00:42:26,734
My least favourite expression.

Andrews, the Met.

649
00:42:37,694 --> 00:42:41,975
Fuck it, the world sometimes,
but it really is a tiny bit, Sunny,

650
00:42:42,015 --> 00:42:46,214
and if you see it getting in the way
at any point, you call me out on it.

651
00:42:50,814 --> 00:42:52,535
<font color="#008000">So, what is this about?</font>

00:42:52,575 --> 00:42:54,455
<font color="#008000">It's about something.</font>

653
00:42:54,495 --> 00:42:57,495
I dunno, I just think,
sometimes, you need a kind of...

654
00:42:57,535 --> 00:43:00,774
trick, to help you move on
from something. A kind of...

655
00:43:02,055 --> 00:43:03,094
..sleight of hand.

656
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:07,015
And maybe mine's that,
if we can do this right,

657
00:43:07,055 --> 00:43:09,415
if we can ignore who they are
and do it by the book...

658
00:43:09,455 --> 00:43:11,134
then all the questions
might go away.

659
00:43:12,975 --> 00:43:16,134
Walker, Finch... and the rest,
they might all go away.
