136
00:09:08,615 --> 00:09:11,282
<font color="yellow">To surgery?</font>
Yeah.

137
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:12,745
<font color="yellow">Right, OK.</font>

138
00:09:13,895 --> 00:09:16,334
<font color="yellow">Wow.</font>
Yeah...

139
00:09:43,943 --> 00:09:45,613
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

140
00:09:47,973 --> 00:09:49,511
<font color="cyan">Hey.</font>

141
00:09:49,513 --> 00:09:51,971
<font color="yellow">So, she's out.</font>
<font color="cyan">Of surgery?</font>

142
00:09:51,973 --> 00:09:57,330
<font color="yellow">Yeah. Spoke to one of the nurses.</font>
<font color="yellow">So she's on her way up to ICU,</font>

143
00:09:57,332 --> 00:09:59,330
<font color="yellow">and the nurse thinks it went OK.</font>

144
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:00,691
<font color="cyan">Really?</font>
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

145
00:10:00,693 --> 00:10:03,330
<font color="yellow">I mean, he said, obviously,</font>
<font color="yellow">we have to speak to the consultant,</font>

146
00:10:03,332 --> 00:10:05,023
<font color="yellow">but he thinks it went really well.</font>

147
00:10:06,183 --> 00:10:08,181
<font color="cyan">Can we go and see her?</font>
<font color="yellow">He's just checking now.</font>

148
00:10:08,183 --> 00:10:10,330
<font color="yellow">I said I'd go back up</font>
<font color="yellow">in ten minutes.</font>

149
00:10:10,332 --> 00:10:11,943
<font color="cyan">OK.</font>

150
00:10:13,183 --> 00:10:16,773
<font color="cyan">OK, I'll, erm... I'll let Dan know.</font>
<font color="cyan">He's about to get a flight.</font>

151
00:10:20,332 --> 00:10:23,460
<font color="yellow">But, sorry, just to be clear -</font>
<font color="yellow">you genuinely think it's possible</font>

152
00:10:23,462 --> 00:10:25,511
<font color="yellow">one of your suspects</font>
<font color="yellow">might've done this?</font>

153
00:10:25,513 --> 00:10:27,691
Well, I mean,
that would be nuts, obviously,

154
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:30,971
but suspects sometimes do
nuts things, so if I were you,

155
00:10:30,973 --> 00:10:33,381
I'd be asking them
where they were when she was hit.

156
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:35,971
'I'd be looking at their cars,
if it was stolen...'

157
00:10:35,973 --> 00:10:39,021
I'd be looking at their prints,
clothes fibres, the lot.

158
00:10:39,023 --> 00:10:40,320
<font color="yellow">I'm on it.</font>

159
00:10:40,322 --> 00:10:42,462
HE EXHALES SHARPLY,
COUGHS

160
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:46,971
OK, guys,
could I have a moment, please?

161
00:10:46,973 --> 00:10:48,263
HE CLEARS HIS THROAT

162
00:10:50,023 --> 00:10:52,941
It's the one thing I can be sure
she'd want us to be doing right now,

163
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:55,790
is carrying on with our jobs...

164
00:10:55,792 --> 00:11:00,253
and doing every thing we can
to find Matthew's killer.

165
00:11:02,183 --> 00:11:03,743
And, as ever...

166
00:11:05,303 --> 00:11:08,103
..I can see no good reason
to go against her wishes.

167
00:11:10,693 --> 00:11:12,823
OK, Fran, what have you got?

168
00:11:15,863 --> 00:11:17,332
HE KNOCKS DOOR

169
00:11:24,863 --> 00:11:28,330
Hi. Er, Clive, is it?

170
00:11:28,332 --> 00:11:29,823
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

171
00:11:31,253 --> 00:11:32,542
Hello, Uncle Clive.

172
00:11:33,823 --> 00:11:37,303
We've never met,
but I'm your nephew, Jerome.

173
00:11:42,303 --> 00:11:47,540
<font color="yellow">Dean Barton/Quinn's brother,</font>
<font color="yellow">Stephen Quinn, died in August 1989.</font>

174
00:11:47,542 --> 00:11:49,251
<font color="yellow">He was four years older than Dean.</font>

175
00:11:49,253 --> 00:11:51,460
<font color="yellow">Found in the street</font>
<font color="yellow">with a fatal knife wound.</font>

176
00:11:51,462 --> 00:11:53,821
<font color="yellow">No-one ever arrested,</font>
<font color="yellow">no witnesses,</font>

177
00:11:53,823 --> 00:11:56,540
<font color="yellow">although the original report</font>
<font color="yellow">suggests the Quinns</font>

178
00:11:56,542 --> 00:12:00,181
<font color="yellow">had a good idea who was to blame,</font>
<font color="yellow">they closed ranks.</font>

179
00:12:00,183 --> 00:12:01,611
Where did the attack take place?

180
00:12:01,613 --> 00:12:06,381
<font color="yellow">Ellerfield Road, Colindale,</font>
<font color="yellow">near where they lived at the time.</font>

181
00:12:06,383 --> 00:12:08,741
Why does that ring a bell?

182
00:12:08,743 --> 00:12:10,971
I dunno. It'll come. Anything else?

183
00:12:10,973 --> 00:12:13,901
<font color="yellow">Oh, just anecdotal stuff</font>
<font color="yellow">from the door-to-doors,</font>

184
00:12:13,903 --> 00:12:16,460
<font color="yellow">that Stephen was not like</font>
<font color="yellow">the other brothers.</font>

185
00:12:16,462 --> 00:12:19,501
<font color="yellow">A quiet lad, academic,</font>
<font color="yellow">not a fighter at all,</font>

186
00:12:19,503 --> 00:12:21,021
<font color="yellow">so it was an odd one.</font>

187
00:12:21,023 --> 00:12:24,460
OK, thank you.
Good detail. Er, Murray?

188
00:12:24,462 --> 00:12:27,251
<font color="cyan">So, Dean Barton</font>
<font color="cyan">has a number of accounts -</font>

189
00:12:27,253 --> 00:12:31,330
<font color="cyan">three business,</font>
<font color="cyan">one personal joint with his wife.</font>

190
00:12:31,332 --> 00:12:34,691
<font color="cyan">And three others -</font>
<font color="cyan">bills, current and for savings,</font>

191
00:12:34,693 --> 00:12:37,051
<font color="cyan">and there was nothing of interest</font>
<font color="cyan">in any of them.</font>

192
00:12:37,053 --> 00:12:38,330
OK.

193
00:12:38,332 --> 00:12:40,891
<font color="cyan">Then I found one other account</font>
<font color="cyan">listed with his,</font>

194
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:42,330
<font color="cyan">but not in his name.</font>

195
00:12:42,332 --> 00:12:44,861
<font color="cyan">Now, that account is in the name</font>
<font color="cyan">of "Georgie Graves".</font>

196
00:12:44,863 --> 00:12:47,381
<font color="cyan">Dean set it up,</font>
<font color="cyan">and he's the signatory,</font>

197
00:12:47,383 --> 00:12:50,101
<font color="cyan">and the account identifier</font>
<font color="cyan">is "godson".</font>

198
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:53,611
<font color="cyan">Now, Dean makes regular payments of</font>
<font color="cyan">40 quid a month into that account,</font>

199
00:12:53,613 --> 00:12:55,611
<font color="cyan">but that's literally</font>
<font color="cyan">all the activity there is.</font>

200
00:12:55,613 --> 00:12:57,381
<font color="cyan">Except until nine days ago,</font>

201
00:12:57,383 --> 00:13:00,251
<font color="cyan">when there was</font>
<font color="cyan">a lump sum payment in,</font>

202
00:13:00,253 --> 00:13:02,973
<font color="cyan">then quickly out, of 10K.</font>

203
00:13:05,453 --> 00:13:07,961
OK, and where
did that money come from?

204
00:13:07,963 --> 00:13:12,810
<font color="cyan">Er, deposited in cash to a branch</font>
<font color="cyan">in Rochester High Street.</font>

205
00:13:12,812 --> 00:13:14,321
And where did it then go to?

206
00:13:14,323 --> 00:13:17,991
<font color="cyan">To an account in the name</font>
<font color="cyan">of Grace Williams.</font>

207
00:13:17,993 --> 00:13:20,523
<font color="cyan">Now, I did a little digging...</font>

208
00:13:21,602 --> 00:13:26,810
<font color="cyan">..and it turns out that that</font>
<font color="cyan">just happens to be the maiden name</font>

209
00:13:26,812 --> 00:13:30,241
<font color="cyan">of the first wife of Ram Sidhu.</font>

210
00:13:30,243 --> 00:13:31,913
<font color="yellow">Wow.</font>

211
00:13:33,273 --> 00:13:36,881
Er... how far back did you go
with those accounts?

212
00:13:36,883 --> 00:13:38,881
<font color="cyan">Five years.</font>
Mm.

213
00:13:38,883 --> 00:13:40,993
Go back further.
<font color="cyan">Guv.</font>

214
00:13:42,763 --> 00:13:47,273
<font color="yellow">I wanted you to know that</font>
<font color="yellow">we absolutely got your message...</font>

215
00:13:48,523 --> 00:13:51,161
<font color="yellow">..and everything is fine.</font>
MACHINE BEEPS STEADILY

216
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:53,350
<font color="yellow">And as soon as you're better,</font>

217
00:13:53,352 --> 00:13:56,881
<font color="yellow">we want you to know that everything</font>
<font color="yellow">will be back to normal.</font>

218
00:13:56,883 --> 00:13:58,203
<font color="yellow">Back to...</font>

219
00:13:59,963 --> 00:14:02,203
<font color="yellow">..street food on a Sunday</font>
<font color="yellow">on the South Bank...</font>

220
00:14:04,633 --> 00:14:07,323
<font color="yellow">..and the B&B</font>
<font color="yellow">at Port Gaverne at Easter.</font>

221
00:14:11,713 --> 00:14:15,273
<font color="yellow">And you and me and Adie</font>
<font color="yellow">watching the World Cup...</font>

222
00:14:17,073 --> 00:14:19,711
<font color="yellow">..and you always asking</font>
<font color="yellow">when the interval is,</font>

223
00:14:19,713 --> 00:14:22,711
<font color="yellow">and us pretending</font>
<font color="yellow">that you were serious.</font>

224
00:14:22,713 --> 00:14:25,963
<font color="yellow">It's all coming back, sweetheart.</font>
<font color="yellow">Promise you.</font>

225
00:14:28,123 --> 00:14:31,881
<font color="yellow">That... and much, much more.</font>

226
00:14:31,883 --> 00:14:33,243
<font color="yellow">All of it.</font>

227
00:14:55,403 --> 00:14:58,761
BOULTING: <font color="cyan">DCI Sidhu, I'm arresting</font>
<font color="cyan">you on suspicion of murder.</font>

228
00:14:58,763 --> 00:15:03,123
PHONE RINGS

229
00:15:04,273 --> 00:15:06,991
<font color="#008000">Hello, DI Khan's phone.</font>
<font color="yellow">Hi, it's Alfie Birch from the lab.</font>

230
00:15:06,993 --> 00:15:08,711
<font color="yellow">I have news for you guys</font>
<font color="yellow">on your pen.</font>

231
00:15:08,713 --> 00:15:10,480
<font color="yellow">'So, I've ran various tests...'</font>

232
00:15:10,482 --> 00:15:13,711
So we do now have a witness
who can identify you by name

233
00:15:13,713 --> 00:15:17,321
as being the young man involved
in a fight with Matthew Walsh

234
00:15:17,323 --> 00:15:20,401
in the Ifield Pub
three weeks before he died.

235
00:15:20,403 --> 00:15:23,041
<font color="yellow">What witness?</font>
The landlady, Suzie Montgomery.

236
00:15:23,043 --> 00:15:25,550
<font color="yellow">Mm, well, I'm sorry,</font>
<font color="yellow">but she's wrong. It wasn't me.</font>

237
00:15:25,552 --> 00:15:27,961
Except we have another witness
who also says that it was.

238
00:15:27,963 --> 00:15:30,161
<font color="yellow">Who?</font>
Fiona Grayson.

239
00:15:30,163 --> 00:15:34,041
And Fiona has given us
a lot of detail about what happened

240
00:15:34,043 --> 00:15:36,241
between you and Matthew Walsh
in the pub,

241
00:15:36,243 --> 00:15:38,841
but also a lot of detail
about what happened

242
00:15:38,843 --> 00:15:41,041
the night of Walsh's death.

243
00:15:41,043 --> 00:15:43,350
Do you have anything that
you wanna add to what you told us

244
00:15:43,352 --> 00:15:44,841
in our last discussion, Ram?

245
00:15:44,843 --> 00:15:47,550
Cos this is your opportunity...
<font color="yellow">What's she told you?</font>

246
00:15:47,552 --> 00:15:49,913
Well, I'd prefer to hear
your side of things first.

247
00:15:52,552 --> 00:15:55,321
<font color="yellow">It was Rob who spotted him.</font>
<font color="yellow">I was half asleep.</font>

248
00:15:55,323 --> 00:15:57,682
<font color="yellow">It was Rob who decided to pull over.</font>

249
00:15:59,193 --> 00:16:01,521
OK, so you lied before?

250
00:16:01,523 --> 00:16:03,800
<font color="yellow">It was also Rob</font>
<font color="yellow">who suggested we give him a tug.</font>

251
00:16:03,802 --> 00:16:06,763
And how did Rob know him?
<font color="yellow">He was in the pub that night.</font>

252
00:16:08,963 --> 00:16:12,241
There's no recollection
by anyone else of him being there.

253
00:16:12,243 --> 00:16:15,041
<font color="yellow">He was a quiet lad,</font>
<font color="yellow">tended to fade into the background.</font>

254
00:16:15,043 --> 00:16:17,321
Yeah, quiet and six foot five.
<font color="yellow">Well, he was there.</font>

255
00:16:17,323 --> 00:16:19,883
<font color="yellow">It was him who spotted Walsh</font>
<font color="yellow">and got out first.</font>

256
00:16:21,403 --> 00:16:24,193
Oh, so you now admit also
that you got out of the car?

257
00:16:26,403 --> 00:16:28,600
<font color="yellow">I did, yes.</font>

258
00:16:28,602 --> 00:16:30,800
So you lied about that before
as well?

259
00:16:30,802 --> 00:16:33,401
So, did you also run after him,
after Matty Walsh?

260
00:16:33,403 --> 00:16:35,600
<font color="yellow">I walked.</font>

261
00:16:35,602 --> 00:16:38,841
You walked after the guy who,
just a few weeks before,

262
00:16:38,843 --> 00:16:42,711
had knocked seven shades of shit
out of you? <font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

263
00:16:42,713 --> 00:16:43,963
OK.

264
00:16:45,163 --> 00:16:47,631
And then, when you found him...?
<font color="yellow">I didn't find him.</font>

265
00:16:47,633 --> 00:16:48,841
How do you mean?

266
00:16:48,843 --> 00:16:51,161
<font color="yellow">I didn't even find Rob</font>
<font color="yellow">or the others after they got out.</font>

267
00:16:51,163 --> 00:16:53,550
<font color="yellow">I didn't find any of them,</font>
<font color="yellow">so I headed home.</font>

268
00:16:53,552 --> 00:16:55,682
But you were in the car
when it got pulled over.

269
00:16:57,123 --> 00:17:01,401
<font color="yellow">So... after maybe 15 minutes</font>
<font color="yellow">of looking for the others,</font>

270
00:17:01,403 --> 00:17:03,191
<font color="yellow">I decided to head back</font>
<font color="yellow">to the main road,</font>

271
00:17:03,193 --> 00:17:04,480
<font color="yellow">hope for a night bus.</font>

272
00:17:04,482 --> 00:17:06,431
<font color="yellow">About half a mile down the road,</font>

273
00:17:06,433 --> 00:17:09,711
<font color="yellow">maybe 40 minutes after I first</font>
<font color="yellow">got out of the car, it pulled up -</font>

274
00:17:09,713 --> 00:17:11,523
<font color="yellow">Rob behind the wheel.</font>

275
00:17:13,552 --> 00:17:16,991
<font color="yellow">I got in.</font>
<font color="yellow">Everybody seemed a bit weird,</font>

276
00:17:16,993 --> 00:17:19,163
<font color="yellow">I asked them what had happened.</font>
<font color="yellow">No-one said much.</font>

277
00:17:20,993 --> 00:17:24,521
<font color="yellow">Then we got pulled over by a traffic</font>
<font color="yellow">cop about five minutes later.</font>

278
00:17:24,523 --> 00:17:28,191
OK. Very different version of events
to Fiona Grayson's.

279
00:17:28,193 --> 00:17:31,321
<font color="yellow">Well, she's gonna save her own back,</font>
<font color="yellow">isn't she?</font>

280
00:17:31,323 --> 00:17:34,961
<font color="yellow">Blame someone else.</font>
<font color="yellow">They'll all do the same.</font>

281
00:17:34,963 --> 00:17:36,401
As indeed would you, I presume.

282
00:17:36,403 --> 00:17:39,680
<font color="yellow">Mm. Except I'm telling the truth.</font>

283
00:17:39,682 --> 00:17:42,631
Despite us having three
good witnesses, who say they saw

284
00:17:42,633 --> 00:17:44,271
an Asian man chasing Matthew Walsh.

285
00:17:44,273 --> 00:17:47,403
<font color="yellow">It was dark, I'm dark - a defence</font>
<font color="yellow">lawyer would make mincemeat of them.</font>

286
00:17:54,163 --> 00:17:59,911
<font color="cyan">"H3-2967."</font>

287
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:01,881
<font color="cyan">Is that what you see?</font>
<font color="#008000">'That's what I see.'</font>

288
00:18:01,883 --> 00:18:05,710
<font color="cyan">Brilliant. Thanks so much.</font>
<font color="#008000">'Send Cass my best.'</font>

289
00:18:05,712 --> 00:18:06,991
<font color="cyan">I will.</font>

290
00:18:06,993 --> 00:18:12,041
So, six days ago, a phone mast
picked up a signal from your phone,

291
00:18:12,043 --> 00:18:14,041
heading down the A3.

292
00:18:14,043 --> 00:18:18,041
I mention it because we also picked
up Dean Barton's phone, same day,

293
00:18:18,043 --> 00:18:20,911
coming down from Rochester,
and about the same time,

294
00:18:20,913 --> 00:18:23,600
also heading down the B3256 -

295
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,831
this very small B-road in Surrey.

296
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:28,552
He switched his phone off
about a mile down that road.

297
00:18:30,802 --> 00:18:33,241
Did you meet him somewhere
down there, Ram? <font color="yellow">No.</font>

298
00:18:33,243 --> 00:18:36,121
No? <font color="yellow">No. </font>What were you doing
down there, then?

299
00:18:36,123 --> 00:18:37,991
<font color="yellow">I went for a walk to clear my head.</font>

300
00:18:37,993 --> 00:18:40,181
<font color="yellow">I've got some personal issues</font>
<font color="yellow">going on in my life.</font>

301
00:18:40,183 --> 00:18:42,391
Mm. Right.

302
00:18:42,393 --> 00:18:44,631
It's a bit of a coincidence,
isn't it?

303
00:18:44,633 --> 00:18:47,720
Dean Barton, a bloke that you say
that you haven't seen for 30 years,

304
00:18:47,722 --> 00:18:51,161
also happens to be down there
at the same time? <font color="yellow">Is it?</font>

305
00:18:51,163 --> 00:18:53,441
60 miles from his house,
30 from yours.

306
00:18:53,443 --> 00:18:58,191
But let's agree for now
that it was a coincidence.

307
00:18:58,193 --> 00:19:00,881
What isn't one, though,
is the ten grand

308
00:19:00,883 --> 00:19:04,631
Dean Barton transferred
to your ex-wife's bank account

309
00:19:04,633 --> 00:19:06,191
just nine days ago.

310
00:19:06,193 --> 00:19:09,901
We checked with your ex, Grace,

311
00:19:09,903 --> 00:19:14,191
and she had vague recollection of
opening an online account with you

312
00:19:14,193 --> 00:19:17,913
many years ago, but had absolutely
no idea that it still existed.

313
00:19:19,043 --> 00:19:24,041
Nor that from 2001 to 2008,
three or four times a year,

314
00:19:24,043 --> 00:19:27,600
lump sums of £5,000
were paid into that account

315
00:19:27,602 --> 00:19:30,881
from the same account the 10,000
was sent from the other day.

316
00:19:30,883 --> 00:19:34,193
An account run by Dean Barton.

317
00:19:37,523 --> 00:19:40,431
We also checked your landline calls
a couple of days either side

318
00:19:40,433 --> 00:19:43,600
of the recent payment.
Can you tell me, DCI Sidhu,

319
00:19:43,602 --> 00:19:47,441
why you called the desk line
of an Andy Renfold,

320
00:19:47,443 --> 00:19:49,991
a customs officer
at the Port of Fenmarsh,

321
00:19:49,993 --> 00:19:51,963
the day the money appeared
in your account?

322
00:19:58,883 --> 00:20:00,552
<font color="yellow">No comment.</font>

323
00:20:01,802 --> 00:20:06,291
You and Dean Barton
clearly have an ongoing relationship

324
00:20:06,293 --> 00:20:09,881
going back many years,
involving him giving you money.

325
00:20:09,883 --> 00:20:12,191
With the Fenmarsh
customs connection,

326
00:20:12,193 --> 00:20:15,911
and the Barton family's
criminal history,

327
00:20:15,913 --> 00:20:19,470
it's not a massive leap to guess
that this has something to do with

328
00:20:19,472 --> 00:20:22,041
drug importation and bribery.

329
00:20:22,043 --> 00:20:25,241
Would I be on the right lines?
<font color="yellow">No comment.</font>

330
00:20:25,243 --> 00:20:29,161
So I have to ask you, why you,
as a serving police officer,

331
00:20:29,163 --> 00:20:31,163
might be susceptible to bribery.

332
00:20:32,552 --> 00:20:38,083
What might Dean Barton
hold over you, DCI Sidhu?

333
00:20:42,552 --> 00:20:44,523
<font color="yellow">I didn't kill him.</font>

334
00:20:46,602 --> 00:20:48,831
<font color="yellow">I found him on the ground,</font>
<font color="yellow">bleeding from the head...</font>

335
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:51,831
BREATHES SHAKILY
<font color="yellow">..next to a wall.</font>

336
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,911
<font color="yellow">I tried to save him.</font>

337
00:20:53,913 --> 00:20:57,800
<font color="yellow">Ask the others, they were there.</font>
<font color="yellow">I gave him CPR.</font>

338
00:20:57,802 --> 00:21:00,800
<font color="yellow">I did everything I could</font>
<font color="yellow">to save him.</font>

339
00:21:00,802 --> 00:21:02,443
<font color="yellow">I'm not a murderer.</font>

340
00:21:10,722 --> 00:21:12,720
We found that at your desk.

341
00:21:12,722 --> 00:21:15,472
How long have you used
a fountain pen, DCI Sidhu?

342
00:21:22,323 --> 00:21:25,881
You know, sometimes, I've felt
slightly like apologising to you.

343
00:21:25,883 --> 00:21:30,053
For Mum, I mean, over the last year,
cos she's so not been herself.

344
00:21:32,933 --> 00:21:36,931
When she's out of this,
when the job's finished,

345
00:21:36,933 --> 00:21:39,293
I just know you're gonna see
a whole new side to her.

346
00:21:41,803 --> 00:21:43,720
But here's the thing -

347
00:21:43,722 --> 00:21:46,291
even with all the crap
that's been going on in her life,

348
00:21:46,293 --> 00:21:49,293
I can just see how happy
you've made her, John.

349
00:21:50,933 --> 00:21:52,493
And will make her.

350
00:21:53,852 --> 00:21:55,323
So, thank you.

351
00:21:57,323 --> 00:21:58,852
<font color="yellow">No thanks required.</font>

352
00:21:59,963 --> 00:22:02,850
<font color="yellow">Your mum is a belter.</font>
ADAM LAUGHS SOFTLY

353
00:22:02,852 --> 00:22:04,963
<font color="yellow">I won the lottery the day I met her.</font>

354
00:22:12,933 --> 00:22:15,691
RINGING
MAN: <font color="cyan">'Cigne Pens. Good morning.'</font>

355
00:22:15,693 --> 00:22:18,691
<font color="#008000">Hi there. It's DC Kaz Willets,</font>
<font color="#008000">Bishop Street Station.</font>

356
00:22:18,693 --> 00:22:20,081
<font color="cyan">'Oh, how can I help?'</font>

357
00:22:20,083 --> 00:22:22,850
<font color="#008000">I'm just trying to track down</font>
<font color="#008000">the purchaser of one of your pens.</font>

358
00:22:22,852 --> 00:22:24,411
<font color="cyan">'Come on up.'</font>
<font color="#008000">Thanks.</font>

359
00:22:24,413 --> 00:22:25,852
BUZZER

360
00:22:27,493 --> 00:22:31,770
I'd like to start, Dean, with
the night of Matthew Walsh's death,

361
00:22:31,772 --> 00:22:35,371
because the account
that you gave my colleague

362
00:22:35,373 --> 00:22:38,770
now differs significantly
from what we've since heard

363
00:22:38,772 --> 00:22:41,161
from both Ram Sidhu
and Fiona Grayson.

364
00:22:41,163 --> 00:22:44,650
So, is there anything
that you'd like to change?

365
00:22:44,652 --> 00:22:45,720
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

366
00:22:45,722 --> 00:22:48,720
OK, what would you like to change?

367
00:22:48,722 --> 00:22:53,011
<font color="yellow">So, erm, after your colleague left,</font>
<font color="yellow">I went back over that night,</font>

368
00:22:53,013 --> 00:22:55,211
<font color="yellow">had a really good think about it,</font>

369
00:22:55,213 --> 00:22:59,801
<font color="yellow">erm, and it was only then</font>
<font color="yellow">that I remembered that, actually,</font>

370
00:22:59,803 --> 00:23:01,720
<font color="yellow">I'd slept for most of the journey.</font>

371
00:23:01,722 --> 00:23:04,161
<font color="yellow">So whilst I said that the car</font>
<font color="yellow">hadn't stopped</font>

372
00:23:04,163 --> 00:23:06,691
<font color="yellow">before it was pulled over</font>
<font color="yellow">by the police,</font>

373
00:23:06,693 --> 00:23:08,131
<font color="yellow">it might well have done,</font>

374
00:23:08,133 --> 00:23:10,691
<font color="yellow">but it's just that I would've had</font>
<font color="yellow">no recollection of it.</font>

375
00:23:10,693 --> 00:23:13,161
OK. Well, once again,
that doesn't chime

376
00:23:13,163 --> 00:23:16,881
with what both Ram Sidhu
and Fiona Grayson have told us.

377
00:23:16,883 --> 00:23:19,491
What they're now saying
is that when it first stopped,

378
00:23:19,493 --> 00:23:21,131
you did, in fact,
get out of the car,

379
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:23,211
you did go after Matthew Walsh,

380
00:23:23,213 --> 00:23:26,131
and then, later, you did help
put his body in the boot of the car.

381
00:23:26,133 --> 00:23:29,801
<font color="yellow">Whoever said that is misremembering</font>
<font color="yellow">or covering their own back.</font>

382
00:23:29,803 --> 00:23:32,881
<font color="yellow">OK, if... IF somebody stuck a body</font>
<font color="yellow">in the back of the car</font>

383
00:23:32,883 --> 00:23:34,650
<font color="yellow">whilst I was asleep...</font>

384
00:23:34,652 --> 00:23:39,650
<font color="yellow">I mean, it's possible, I guess.</font>
<font color="yellow">I knew nothing about it.</font>

385
00:23:39,652 --> 00:23:42,720
So you knew nothing of the events
of that night at all?

386
00:23:42,722 --> 00:23:44,333
<font color="yellow">No!</font>

387
00:23:47,243 --> 00:23:51,801
So, tell me, Dean, how on earth did
you manage to convince Ram Sidhu,

388
00:23:51,803 --> 00:23:54,650
an intelligent and ambitious
young police officer,

389
00:23:54,652 --> 00:23:57,083
to become part of your
cocaine smuggling operation?

390
00:23:59,493 --> 00:24:01,363
<font color="yellow">What cocaine smuggling operation?</font>

391
00:24:03,722 --> 00:24:08,911
I am showing the suspect
exhibit MB001,

392
00:24:08,913 --> 00:24:12,881
a selection of bank statements
from an account set up by you, Dean,

393
00:24:12,883 --> 00:24:16,331
detailing multiple money transfers
between this account

394
00:24:16,333 --> 00:24:18,770
and another account
linked with Ram Sidhu.

395
00:24:18,772 --> 00:24:20,241
A couple of hours ago,

396
00:24:20,243 --> 00:24:24,720
police arrested a customs officer
called Andy Renfold.

397
00:24:24,722 --> 00:24:27,441
Been very cooperative already,
apparently.

398
00:24:27,443 --> 00:24:30,241
And over the next few weeks,
our forensics finance teams

399
00:24:30,243 --> 00:24:32,520
will be all over
your financial history,

400
00:24:32,522 --> 00:24:35,131
and, I suspect, given time,
will be able to prove

401
00:24:35,133 --> 00:24:38,650
that you were importing cocaine
through the port at Fenmarsh.

402
00:24:38,652 --> 00:24:42,650
So, again, I ask you,
was it just coincidence

403
00:24:42,652 --> 00:24:46,182
that your old friend from Hendon
was so easily corruptible,

404
00:24:46,184 --> 00:24:49,994
or did you have some unique
kind of leverage over him?

405
00:24:54,793 --> 00:24:56,152
<font color="yellow">No comment.</font>

406
00:24:56,154 --> 00:24:59,742
Did you witness him involved in the
murder of Matthew Walsh? <font color="yellow">No comment.</font>

407
00:24:59,744 --> 00:25:02,822
Did you see him stab him
in the head? <font color="yellow">No comment.</font>

408
00:25:02,824 --> 00:25:06,154
Did you then help dispose
of the body? <font color="yellow">No comment.</font>

409
00:25:11,304 --> 00:25:13,434
Let's take a break there.

410
00:25:14,744 --> 00:25:16,354
<font color="cyan">What is it?</font>

411
00:25:18,074 --> 00:25:20,352
HE SIGHS
I don't know.

412
00:25:20,354 --> 00:25:23,512
Why didn't he just throw Sidhu
under the bus?

413
00:25:23,514 --> 00:25:26,154
Felt weird. Something we're missing.

414
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:30,874
<font color="yellow">Oh, and, er, Rob sends his love.</font>

415
00:25:32,514 --> 00:25:35,072
<font color="yellow">Been in the wars himself.</font>

416
00:25:35,074 --> 00:25:39,942
<font color="yellow">Remember his teeth thing, the</font>
<font color="yellow">implants he had done in Budapest?</font>

417
00:25:39,944 --> 00:25:43,571
<font color="yellow">He had them filed down in the end</font>
<font color="yellow">so he could shut his mouth properly,</font>

418
00:25:43,573 --> 00:25:45,632
<font color="yellow">and then, last week,</font>
<font color="yellow">one of them fell out</font>

419
00:25:45,634 --> 00:25:47,904
<font color="yellow">literally whilst he was kissing</font>
<font color="yellow">his new girlfriend.</font>

420
00:25:49,154 --> 00:25:52,791
<font color="yellow">She almost swallowed it,</font>
<font color="yellow">which, as he said,</font>

421
00:25:52,793 --> 00:25:54,432
<font color="yellow">"Wouldn't have gone down well, Adie.</font>

422
00:25:54,434 --> 00:25:56,944
<font color="yellow">"Wouldn't have gone down well</font>
<font color="yellow">at all."</font>

423
00:26:04,434 --> 00:26:06,184
HE SIGHS

424
00:26:15,304 --> 00:26:16,874
Fuck!

425
00:26:18,234 --> 00:26:19,581
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

426
00:26:19,583 --> 00:26:23,744
Yardley Crescent, where
the Walshes lived - that's NW9.

427
00:26:25,234 --> 00:26:27,581
Colindale, that's NW9.

428
00:26:27,583 --> 00:26:30,514
And Ellerfield Road, where Stephen
Quinn was stabbed, where's that?

429
00:26:31,634 --> 00:26:33,274
<font color="yellow">Er...</font>

430
00:26:34,354 --> 00:26:37,942
<font color="yellow">It's... right in between.</font>
Mm.

431
00:26:37,944 --> 00:26:40,911
So how's about Matthew Walsh
killed Stephen Quinn?

432
00:26:40,913 --> 00:26:43,742
Two skanky criminal families
living half a mile from each other,

433
00:26:43,744 --> 00:26:45,382
what are the chances
they were rivals?

434
00:26:45,384 --> 00:26:47,302
<font color="cyan">High.</font>

435
00:26:47,304 --> 00:26:50,541
The knife wound
that Stephen Quinn suffered...

436
00:26:50,543 --> 00:26:53,663
where was it on his body?
<font color="yellow">Er...</font>

437
00:26:57,434 --> 00:26:59,942
<font color="yellow">Oh, man... In the head.</font>

438
00:26:59,944 --> 00:27:02,182
<font color="cyan">So, Stephen Quinn</font>
<font color="cyan">is stabbed by Matthew Walsh</font>

439
00:27:02,184 --> 00:27:04,152
<font color="cyan">in some sort of territorial dispute?</font>

440
00:27:04,154 --> 00:27:06,742
Yeah, and the Quinns know
who did it, or at least they guess,

441
00:27:06,744 --> 00:27:08,512
and they're biding their time
for payback.

442
00:27:08,514 --> 00:27:11,432
<font color="yellow">And then, that night,</font>
<font color="yellow">driving back from the party,</font>

443
00:27:11,434 --> 00:27:14,992
<font color="yellow">Sidhu sees Walsh, the lad he had a</font>
<font color="yellow">fight with three weeks previously...</font>

444
00:27:14,994 --> 00:27:17,742
Except what no-one else knows
is that this is also the lad

445
00:27:17,744 --> 00:27:20,543
that Dean believes
murdered his brother.

446
00:27:21,713 --> 00:27:23,234
<font color="yellow">She'll be proud of you.</font>

447
00:27:24,944 --> 00:27:28,463
<font color="#008000">Guys... I have got a right result</font>
<font color="#008000">with our pen.</font>

448
00:27:29,994 --> 00:27:34,022
So, the pen was a nice one.
Cost north of a grand today.

449
00:27:34,024 --> 00:27:37,512
And pens like that, Dean,
they have serial numbers

450
00:27:37,514 --> 00:27:41,742
which can identify who purchased
them all these years later.

451
00:27:41,744 --> 00:27:43,942
Do you know who bought that one?
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

452
00:27:43,944 --> 00:27:45,304
It was your brother, Stephen.

453
00:27:46,514 --> 00:27:49,543
<font color="yellow">What, so you think Stephen</font>
<font color="yellow">killed Walsh?</font>

454
00:27:50,824 --> 00:27:53,024
<font color="cyan">Unlikely. He'd been dead</font>
<font color="cyan">eight months by then.</font>

455
00:27:54,463 --> 00:27:57,222
<font color="yellow">So? </font>So, Cigne,
the company that make the pens,

456
00:27:57,224 --> 00:27:58,942
have, for over a hundred years,

457
00:27:58,944 --> 00:28:02,872
offered purchasers
a free engraving service.

458
00:28:02,874 --> 00:28:06,302
Initials, name, up to six letters.

459
00:28:06,304 --> 00:28:10,152
Your brother bought this pen
on August 2nd,

460
00:28:10,154 --> 00:28:12,352
a week before your 18th birthday,

461
00:28:12,354 --> 00:28:15,302
and their records show
he asked for the initials "DB"

462
00:28:15,304 --> 00:28:17,872
to be engraved on the lid because...

463
00:28:17,874 --> 00:28:19,791
he'd bought it for you, Dean,
hadn't he?

464
00:28:19,793 --> 00:28:25,102
A present for a brother he hoped
was destined for a better life

465
00:28:25,104 --> 00:28:28,512
than the one that your surname
prescribed.

466
00:28:28,514 --> 00:28:31,182
And then, a few weeks later,
he was murdered.

467
00:28:31,184 --> 00:28:34,274
The brother you adored,
who'd encouraged you to escape.

468
00:28:35,554 --> 00:28:37,022
Your ally.

469
00:28:37,024 --> 00:28:40,822
Stabbed through the eye
with a knife by the man,

470
00:28:40,824 --> 00:28:44,072
eight months later, you found
unconscious in a patch of mud

471
00:28:44,074 --> 00:28:46,661
on a north-west London allotment.

472
00:28:46,663 --> 00:28:50,072
So, I've spoken to the CPS
Homicide Unit, and at this point,

473
00:28:50,074 --> 00:28:54,302
they are very happy for us
to charge you with his murder.

474
00:28:54,304 --> 00:28:58,534
This is your opportunity now, Dean,
to tell us your side of the story.

475
00:29:11,933 --> 00:29:14,322
<font color="yellow">I was a young man who'd, er...</font>

476
00:29:14,324 --> 00:29:16,322
<font color="yellow">who'd grown up...</font>

477
00:29:16,324 --> 00:29:19,122
<font color="yellow">drenched in violence.</font>

478
00:29:19,124 --> 00:29:21,532
<font color="yellow">From my father to my mother,</font>

479
00:29:21,534 --> 00:29:24,202
<font color="yellow">from my father to me</font>
<font color="yellow">and my brothers,</font>

480
00:29:24,204 --> 00:29:28,454
<font color="yellow">and between all of us</font>
<font color="yellow">and the rest of the world.</font>

481
00:29:32,813 --> 00:29:34,813
<font color="yellow">I used it. I was...</font>

482
00:29:37,454 --> 00:29:39,764
<font color="yellow">I was a victim of it</font>
<font color="yellow">every day of my life.</font>

483
00:29:41,574 --> 00:29:43,044
<font color="yellow">It was like breathing.</font>

484
00:29:49,324 --> 00:29:51,534
<font color="yellow">Which is why I stayed in the car</font>
<font color="yellow">for so long.</font>

485
00:29:53,244 --> 00:29:54,454
<font color="yellow">Because I knew.</font>

486
00:29:57,534 --> 00:30:00,681
<font color="yellow">I've no idea how I,</font>
<font color="yellow">er, how I found him first.</font>

487
00:30:00,683 --> 00:30:02,882
<font color="yellow">I mean, the others,</font>
<font color="yellow">they got out way before me.</font>

488
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:04,014
<font color="yellow">But I did.</font>

489
00:30:05,574 --> 00:30:09,402
<font color="yellow">He'd obviously, er,</font>
<font color="yellow">tripped whilst he was running.</font>

490
00:30:09,404 --> 00:30:11,681
<font color="yellow">He'd hit his head</font>
<font color="yellow">on this low brick wall,</font>

491
00:30:11,683 --> 00:30:13,882
<font color="yellow">and, um, he'd knocked himself out.</font>

492
00:30:13,884 --> 00:30:17,094
<font color="yellow">And, at first, I just stood there</font>
<font color="yellow">looking at him, just...</font>

493
00:30:18,813 --> 00:30:23,733
<font color="yellow">..trying to...</font>
<font color="yellow">just trying to stop myself, I think.</font>

494
00:30:26,124 --> 00:30:30,012
<font color="yellow">But, in the end, I couldn't.</font>

495
00:30:30,014 --> 00:30:31,764
<font color="yellow">Like I say, it was in my DNA.</font>

496
00:30:36,014 --> 00:30:39,174
HE SOBS
<font color="yellow">So, I did it. I did it.</font>

497
00:30:43,374 --> 00:30:45,483
<font color="yellow">I did what he'd done to Stephen.</font>

498
00:30:46,884 --> 00:30:48,294
<font color="yellow">I stabbed him.</font>

499
00:30:50,294 --> 00:30:55,012
TEARFULLY: <font color="yellow">I pushed it through</font>
<font color="yellow">his wound, and I pushed, I pushed,</font>

500
00:30:55,014 --> 00:30:56,372
<font color="yellow">I fucking pushed...</font>

501
00:30:56,374 --> 00:30:59,244
HE GASPS FOR BREATH,
SIGHS

502
00:31:02,733 --> 00:31:04,324
<font color="yellow">Then I saw Ram.</font>

503
00:31:05,683 --> 00:31:08,374
<font color="yellow">He was coming through the trees,</font>
<font color="yellow">looking for him, so I left.</font>

504
00:31:09,603 --> 00:31:11,762
<font color="yellow">Came back, like,</font>
<font color="yellow">ten minutes later when...</font>

505
00:31:11,764 --> 00:31:13,092
HE SNIFFS

506
00:31:13,094 --> 00:31:15,764
<font color="yellow">..when he was giving him CPR</font>
<font color="yellow">and the others had caught up.</font>

507
00:31:22,524 --> 00:31:24,654
<font color="yellow">What I did, it's dreadful.</font>

508
00:31:28,454 --> 00:31:32,372
<font color="yellow">Unusually...</font>
<font color="yellow">It's just appalling violence.</font>

509
00:31:32,374 --> 00:31:35,204
<font color="yellow">But it's... it's-it's who I was.</font>

510
00:31:41,174 --> 00:31:42,522
HE SNIFFS

511
00:31:42,524 --> 00:31:44,884
<font color="yellow">I tried to escape my past.</font>

512
00:31:48,483 --> 00:31:50,294
<font color="yellow">I failed at the first hurdle.</font>

513
00:31:53,683 --> 00:31:55,324
<font color="yellow">I can change my name...</font>

514
00:31:57,764 --> 00:32:00,522
<font color="yellow">..try and...</font>
HE SIGHS HEAVILY

515
00:32:00,524 --> 00:32:02,654
<font color="yellow">..remove myself from my family.</font>

516
00:32:05,483 --> 00:32:08,094
<font color="yellow">Try and make myself</font>
<font color="yellow">something better.</font>

517
00:32:15,483 --> 00:32:17,681
<font color="yellow">But we are who we are. I don't...</font>

518
00:32:17,683 --> 00:32:19,654
<font color="yellow">I don't think you can</font>
<font color="yellow">ever really change that.</font>

519
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:36,679
For what it's worth, I did always
think it was an accident, sir.

520
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:42,138
Not that that's any excuse,
but's it's been exhausting,

521
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:46,927
running from my appalling mistakes
all these years.

522
00:32:46,929 --> 00:32:51,760
And when I come out of prison,
I hope I can live a simpler life...

523
00:32:55,500 --> 00:33:00,679
..which allows me to help those
less fortunate than me.

524
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:05,170
That goes in some way
to making reparation.

525
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,280
So, goodbye, sir.

526
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:18,540
And, again, my sincerest apologies.

527
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:25,540
<font color="yellow">Your reparation has been</font>
<font color="yellow">the last three decades, Liz.</font>

528
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:28,770
<font color="yellow">Good luck.</font>

529
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:34,900
SHE CRIES

530
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:38,200
Thank you.

531
00:33:43,859 --> 00:33:45,609
<font color="cyan">This way, Ma'am.</font>

532
00:33:50,859 --> 00:33:54,328
<font color="yellow">And you're sure there are no other</font>

<font color="yellow">Er... so, the other car,</font>
<font color="yellow">Range Rover, they now know,</font>

536
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:07,607

<font color="yellow">car thief.</font>

537

<font color="yellow">in front of him.</font>

540
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:20,130
Jesus.

HE SIGHS
<font color="yellow">..we had to call an ambulance.</font>

557
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:17,378
<font color="yellow">I never for one second</font>
<font color="yellow">stopped to consider</font>

558
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:20,500
<font color="yellow">what that would mean for any of us.</font>
<font color="yellow">I just wanted to do the right thing.</font>

559
00:35:23,939 --> 00:35:28,968
<font color="yellow">And then I saw the way they were all</font>

560
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:32,100
<font color="yellow">I knew there was only one person</font>
<font color="yellow">they'd ever blame.</font>

561
00:35:41,819 --> 00:35:45,857
They accept that the rest of us
didn't know what Dean had done,

562
00:35:45,859 --> 00:35:48,687
but they're going to charge Ram,
Liz and me

563
00:35:48,689 --> 00:35:51,380
with preventing a lawful burial.

564

get a custodial sentence.

565
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:03,138
<font color="yellow">And the other stuff...?</font>

566
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:08,658
Well... they obviously can't prove
I was over the limit now,

567
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:10,408
so that might go away.

568
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:13,428
But I told them about
the licence forgery,

569
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:15,819
and my lawyer thinks
that's definitely a custodial.

570
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:23,819
<font color="yellow">Fiona, I am... beyond stunned</font>

00:36:25,819 --> 00:36:30,498
<font color="yellow">..so hurt and angry</font>

572

00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:34,790
<font color="yellow">I'm also angry at myself.</font>

574
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:40,788
<font color="yellow">For not seeing any of this,</font>
<font color="yellow">for not asking enough questions.</font>

575
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:42,300
<font color="yellow">Being too accepting.</font>

576
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:48,410
<font color="yellow">But, in the end,</font>
<font color="yellow">the simple truth is...</font>

577
00:36:49,609 --> 00:36:51,500
<font color="yellow">..I don't find myself...</font>

<font color="cyan">contrary to common law.</font>

590
00:37:43,629 --> 00:37:47,627
<font color="cyan">You are also charged that on a date</font>
<font color="cyan">between the 22nd March, 2020</font>

591
00:37:47,629 --> 00:37:49,988
<font color="cyan">and the 24th March, 2020,</font>

592
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:52,268
<font color="cyan">you did illegally import</font>
<font color="cyan">controlled substances,</font>

593
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,707
<font color="cyan">contrary to Section 171</font>

<font color="yellow">Tell his family I'm... I'm sorry.</font>

597
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,400
TEARFULLY: <font color="yellow">It's a terrible,</font>
<font color="yellow">terrible thing that I did.</font>

598
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:13,238
<font color="yellow">And I've regretted it</font>
<font color="yellow">every single day of my life.</font>

599
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:17,040
<font color="yellow">So, please tell them that I am,</font>
<font color="yellow">erm... I'm so sorry.</font>

600
00:38:19,759 --> 00:38:22,240
<font color="#008000">OK. Come with me, Mr Barton.</font>

601
00:38:24,959 --> 00:38:26,759
<font color="#008000">That's it. Straight down.</font>

00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,070
<font color="yellow">What are you waiting for?</font>

604
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:53,070
<font color="yellow">Go and tell her we did it.</font>
<font color="yellow">She did it. Again.</font>

605
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:00,400
So, we knew from our scans that
she'd had a bleed on her brain...

606
00:39:01,629 --> 00:39:03,188
..but when we opened her up,

607
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:06,068
it was actually significantly worse
than we'd feared.

608
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:08,757
A substantial subdural haematoma,

609
00:39:08,759 --> 00:39:11,348
which had caused extensive
compression and bruising

610
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:12,877
to her brain.

611
00:39:12,879 --> 00:39:18,188
And someone with
that level of damage is,

612
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:23,040
I'm so sorry to say, very unlikely
to recover brain function.

613
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:28,238
We will, of course,
continue to monitor her

614
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,757
over the coming days,

615
00:39:29,759 --> 00:39:33,627
we'll try to see if she can breathe
independently, but....

<font color="yellow">Grandad...</font>
