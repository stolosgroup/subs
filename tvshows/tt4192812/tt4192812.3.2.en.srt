1
00:00:07,437 --> 00:00:10,356
Last night one of the workmen dug up
the section of a human hipbone.

2
00:00:10,486 --> 00:00:12,935
You think it's female?
I think, from the pelvis shape.

3
00:00:12,965 --> 00:00:14,924
I'll know more when I get her back.

4
00:00:15,314 --> 00:00:16,963
This is the body of a child.

5
00:00:16,993 --> 00:00:20,691
That's it. Join us next week
for the first of the semis.

6
00:00:20,881 --> 00:00:23,920
It's Eliot. His flatmate hasn't seen
him for a couple of days.

7
00:00:24,749 --> 00:00:27,088
Eliot?
Hi, Dad.

8
00:00:28,018 --> 00:00:29,747
To Dad and Carol.
Thank you.

9
00:00:29,907 --> 00:00:30,907
Thanks, guys.

10
00:00:30,927 --> 00:00:32,746
So the complaint against you,
Dr Finch,

11
00:00:32,796 --> 00:00:35,894
is that you verbally abused
and threatened Mrs Avery.

12
00:00:35,914 --> 00:00:40,332
No-one in this town believes a word
of these allegations. They know you.

13
00:00:40,642 --> 00:00:42,981
I can't make you a better salesman.

14
00:00:43,131 --> 00:00:44,930
So what do you think
you COULD afford?

15
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:47,669
Just sign and date it, Mr Salthouse.

16
00:00:47,749 --> 00:00:49,838
I need some of my money. 4,000.

17
00:00:49,928 --> 00:00:53,566
Jamila, do you think that
you might ever consider marrying me?

18
00:00:53,856 --> 00:00:55,695
The bone was fixed
with a surgical plate.

19
00:00:55,895 --> 00:00:58,134
These are Greek letters.
They're a Cypriot firm.

20
00:00:58,334 --> 00:01:01,053
We make contact with each of
the families of these missing girls

21
00:01:01,253 --> 00:01:04,491
and ask them if their daughter
ever broke her arm on holiday.

22
00:01:04,651 --> 00:01:06,011
Your sister, did you say?

23
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:08,609
And how sure are you
that she broke her wrist?

24
00:01:08,809 --> 00:01:11,048
100%.
She slipped by the swimming pool.

25
00:01:11,248 --> 00:01:13,727
'I think it was Cyprus.'
It's her.

35
00:02:03,664 --> 00:02:07,023
Sorry, Dr Balcombe,
could you say that last bit again?

36
00:02:07,223 --> 00:02:10,021
The signal dropped out.
Yeah, yeah, I can. Go ahead.

37
00:02:10,221 --> 00:02:12,380
Have you managed
to get in touch with Winchester yet?

38
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,579
I did, and the files
are coming up this evening.

39
00:02:14,619 --> 00:02:16,978
The original OIC died
a few years ago,

40
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:19,337
so his number two's
going to give you a bell.

41
00:02:19,377 --> 00:02:21,536
What's his name?
'John Bentley.'

42
00:02:21,576 --> 00:02:23,575
He's retired now, was a DCI.
'Great.

43
00:02:23,735 --> 00:02:24,974
'Thanks for that, Jake.'

44
00:02:25,174 --> 00:02:27,053
Speak later.
Yeah, I'll pass that on to her now,

45
00:02:27,173 --> 00:02:29,692
Yeah, thanks. Bye.

46
00:02:29,852 --> 00:02:32,051
So, she was cleaning the skull,

47
00:02:32,251 --> 00:02:34,130
washing off all the mud and crap
and that,

48
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:37,209
and, er, this morning she managed
to locate the hyoid bone?

49
00:02:37,409 --> 00:02:39,568
The...
The little one?

50
00:02:39,608 --> 00:02:41,447
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
and after cleaning it,

51
00:02:41,647 --> 00:02:45,645
it actually came apart,
separated into two bits.

52
00:02:45,805 --> 00:02:46,804
OK.

53
00:02:46,884 --> 00:02:49,443
Can she say whether
that was pre or postmortem?

54
00:02:49,643 --> 00:02:53,401
Not 100%, no,
but given that hyoid fracture

55
00:02:53,601 --> 00:02:56,880
is pretty exclusively associated
with strangulation,

56
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,079
her guess is pre.

57
00:03:08,554 --> 00:03:10,793
HE HUMS

58
00:03:24,467 --> 00:03:25,747
What?

59
00:03:28,345 --> 00:03:29,625
No.

60
00:03:30,744 --> 00:03:31,864
No...

61
00:03:32,024 --> 00:03:35,982
Frankie?

62
00:03:36,142 --> 00:03:37,501
You knew?

63
00:03:37,701 --> 00:03:40,180
I knew he was experimenting
with his identity, yeah.

64
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,859
And you didn't at any point
think you might mention that to me?

65
00:03:42,939 --> 00:03:44,938
Eliot's capacity
for confounding our expectations

66
00:03:45,098 --> 00:03:46,497
is hardly breaking news, James.

67
00:03:46,697 --> 00:03:50,415
Besides, you don't get to piss off
to another continent for eight years

68
00:03:50,615 --> 00:03:53,414
and then just expect full disclosure
whenever it suits you.

69
00:03:53,614 --> 00:03:56,612
I'm still his father.
Biologically, I suppose, yes.

70
00:03:58,252 --> 00:04:02,290
It's been 17 whole years since
I left you for someone better, Mel.

71
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:05,089
Don't you think
it's time you got over me?

72
00:04:05,249 --> 00:04:07,488
FOOTSTEPS RECEDE

73
00:04:13,805 --> 00:04:15,004
What did they take?

74
00:04:15,204 --> 00:04:18,922
Frank's missing, and they took some
money I had for a deposit on a flat.

75
00:04:19,082 --> 00:04:21,401
Oh, Chris, I'm so sorry.

76
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:23,200
Is the van damaged?

77
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,559
Yes, yes,
they smashed a window to get in.

78
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:27,838
And have you got somewhere
you can get that fixed?

79
00:04:28,038 --> 00:04:31,197
'I don't know. No. I...
I'm just not thinking straight.'

80
00:04:31,397 --> 00:04:35,875
OK, first up, it's all gonna be OK.
We're gonna sort everything out.

81
00:04:36,074 --> 00:04:39,353
Look, I've got a thing in Manchester
I need to be at right now,

82
00:04:39,513 --> 00:04:40,712
but it's only on this morning,

83
00:04:40,832 --> 00:04:43,871
so I could pop down late afternoon,
how does that sound?

84
00:04:44,071 --> 00:04:45,910
I'd really appreciate
having somebody here.

85
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,349
I don't feel at all good.

86
00:04:47,549 --> 00:04:49,828
'But you can't just drop...'
Then let's do that.

87
00:04:50,028 --> 00:04:54,586
I could be with you by about four.
You OK till then?

88
00:04:54,746 --> 00:04:56,265
Yeah.

89
00:04:56,425 --> 00:04:57,904
Yeah. Thanks, Tim.

90
00:04:58,064 --> 00:04:59,824
'It's all gonna be OK.'

91
00:05:00,023 --> 00:05:01,863
Lots of love, mate.
I'll see you at four.

92
00:05:02,063 --> 00:05:03,902
'OK, yeah,
I'll... I'll see you then.'

93
00:05:33,008 --> 00:05:34,488
It's a left after the church.

94
00:05:36,087 --> 00:05:38,566
Well, Mrs Avery
had been a patient of mine

95
00:05:38,726 --> 00:05:41,445
since I moved to the town in 2003.

96
00:05:41,604 --> 00:05:42,964
Just over six years ago,

97
00:05:43,164 --> 00:05:45,803
she began displaying
the early signs of dementia,

98
00:05:46,002 --> 00:05:49,441
specifically
a form called Pick's disease.

99
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:53,279
Can you describe to me the specific
symptoms of Pick's, please,

100
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:54,559
in its later stages?

101
00:05:54,758 --> 00:05:57,877
Well, in its later stages,
it's characterised by memory loss,

102
00:05:58,077 --> 00:06:02,275
by an increasing lack of empathy,
by repetitive behaviours,

103
00:06:02,315 --> 00:06:06,673
but perhaps most distinctly
by an increasing lack of inhibition,

104
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:10,111
typified by regular use of profanity

105
00:06:10,271 --> 00:06:13,070
and bursts of anger and aggression.

106
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:16,229
And was Mrs Avery's behaviour
typical of someone with Pick's?

107
00:06:16,389 --> 00:06:17,788
It was.

108
00:06:17,988 --> 00:06:20,547
So would you describe her behaviour
as challenging?

109
00:06:20,707 --> 00:06:21,986
HE SIGHS

110
00:06:22,146 --> 00:06:23,705
At times, yes.

111
00:06:23,905 --> 00:06:26,904
And in the six years
you were helping her with this,

112
00:06:27,104 --> 00:06:28,903
how many times
were you called to the house

113
00:06:29,063 --> 00:06:30,702
by Mrs Avery's daughter?

114
00:06:32,421 --> 00:06:35,220
I made 42 home visits
during those six years.

115
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:39,618
And in that time, do you recall
ever losing your temper,

116
00:06:39,658 --> 00:06:42,137
or being verbally violent
towards her?

117
00:06:42,337 --> 00:06:46,775
No, there were certainly times
when I had to be very firm with her,

118
00:06:46,975 --> 00:06:50,973
and there were times when
I had to physically restrain her

119
00:06:51,133 --> 00:06:52,932
if she was trying to hit me

120
00:06:53,132 --> 00:06:55,691
but, no, I don't believe
I ever lost my temper.

121
00:07:01,248 --> 00:07:02,567
Twins?

122
00:07:04,486 --> 00:07:08,045
I'm sorry, we... we didn't pick
that up in our briefing..

123
00:07:08,205 --> 00:07:10,164
It's fine.

124
00:07:10,364 --> 00:07:13,043
Identical, or...?
Yes.

125
00:07:13,242 --> 00:07:18,840
I'm... exactly
what she would have looked like now.

126
00:07:19,999 --> 00:07:21,799
So can I start by saying

127
00:07:21,998 --> 00:07:24,597
we do obviously
still have to confirm

128
00:07:24,797 --> 00:07:27,556
that the remains we found
are your daughter's.

129
00:07:29,915 --> 00:07:31,634
Given what you've just told us,
Jessica,

130
00:07:31,834 --> 00:07:34,713
it would make sense if we could take
a DNA swab from you.

131
00:07:34,873 --> 00:07:36,752
Would you be OK with that?

132
00:07:36,912 --> 00:07:38,831
Course.

133
00:07:39,031 --> 00:07:42,429
And obviously
the sooner we can get that done,

134
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:44,788
the sooner
we'll know for sure, so...

135
00:07:44,828 --> 00:07:46,147
Do it now if you want.

136
00:07:46,307 --> 00:07:47,947
OK.

137
00:07:48,107 --> 00:07:49,106
Yeah.

138
00:07:50,785 --> 00:07:53,864
And I should just say
waiting for the results

139
00:07:54,064 --> 00:07:58,622
won't slow down what'll happen now
from our point of view, which...

140
00:08:00,341 --> 00:08:02,620
..I assure you
will be a full reopening

141
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:05,099
of the investigation
into Hayley's death.

142
00:08:05,259 --> 00:08:06,538
Where you found her...

143
00:08:07,818 --> 00:08:09,137
..and...

144
00:08:10,536 --> 00:08:12,375
..how her remains were...

145
00:08:14,135 --> 00:08:17,453
..will you be able to tell at all
how she died?

146
00:08:18,772 --> 00:08:22,051
From her remains alone
it's always going to be...

147
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:29,328
..hard to be completely sure
so many years later.

148
00:08:32,126 --> 00:08:36,804
But there is some evidence to
suggest that Hayley was strangled.

149
00:08:36,964 --> 00:08:39,403
SHE WAILS

150
00:08:51,078 --> 00:08:53,397
I am...

151
00:08:53,557 --> 00:08:55,476
so sorry to have to tell you that.

152
00:08:57,955 --> 00:09:00,913
But please believe me when I say

153
00:09:01,113 --> 00:09:03,792
we are going to investigate this
crime as if it happened yesterday.

154
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:09,029
We are gonna find out
who was responsible for her death...

155
00:09:11,308 --> 00:09:13,028
..and then we are going to make sure

156
00:09:13,228 --> 00:09:15,966
that they are punished
for the terrible wrong they did.

157
00:09:37,367 --> 00:09:39,526
Are you looking for Chris, Mila?
Yeah.

158
00:09:39,735 --> 00:09:40,895
He hasn't been in today.

159
00:09:41,095 --> 00:09:43,834
Oh, OK.
He said to meet him here at one.

160
00:09:43,854 --> 00:09:47,652
Yeah, we were expecting him,
but have you tried calling him?

161
00:09:48,132 --> 00:09:49,811
I'll try again. Thanks, Pat.

162
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:53,369
RINGING TONE

163
00:09:54,729 --> 00:09:57,167
PHONE RINGS

164
00:10:18,888 --> 00:10:21,126
Well, let me tell you,
they loved meeting you.

165
00:10:21,156 --> 00:10:24,955
Oh, my God, did they?
Cos I was absolutely terrified.

166
00:10:25,155 --> 00:10:27,034
Sal, you knew who Stormy was.
SHE LAUGHS

167
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:28,913
Stormzy!

168
00:10:29,203 --> 00:10:30,322
'Yeah, and him.'

169
00:10:30,392 --> 00:10:33,631
I promise you,
you are their life-long best friend.

170
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:38,269
LAUGHTER THROUGH WALL
Yeah. Yeah, will do.

171
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:39,588
KNOCK ON DOOR

172
00:10:45,066 --> 00:10:47,185
Oh, hi, Jessica.

173
00:10:47,295 --> 00:10:50,213
Have you got a minute?
Of course. Come in.

174
00:11:07,475 --> 00:11:10,794
I don't know if this will surprise
you or not, but, erm...

175
00:11:11,014 --> 00:11:13,892
no-one in Middenham's gonna
thank you for finding my sister.

176
00:11:15,212 --> 00:11:19,640
I mean, maybe they'll be pleased
for us on a personal level,

177
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:23,008
that we can bury her, but, erm...

178
00:11:23,618 --> 00:11:27,006
it took the town
maybe ten years to get over her.

179
00:11:27,206 --> 00:11:32,324
The whole media thing completely
killed off the tourist trade.

180
00:11:33,753 --> 00:11:35,033
The holiday rentals,

181
00:11:35,123 --> 00:11:38,401
the passing trade that the teashops
and the giftshops relied on,

182
00:11:38,561 --> 00:11:39,770
that all completely went

183
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,680
because nobody wanted to come here
any more.

184
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:47,437
We were like a...
a Soham or a Praia da Luz.

185
00:11:48,656 --> 00:11:51,775
And now that that's all going to be
dragged up again, I just, er...

186
00:11:51,925 --> 00:11:53,284
I just wanted to warn you

187
00:11:53,394 --> 00:11:55,873
that you might not find people
that cooperative.

188
00:11:57,962 --> 00:12:01,381
As a copper, I get used
to never being that welcome.

189
00:12:07,988 --> 00:12:09,187
And you?

190
00:12:09,717 --> 00:12:11,586
And your mum and dad?

191
00:12:12,036 --> 00:12:13,635
Are YOU glad we're here?

192
00:12:19,592 --> 00:12:22,331
I wish you could have met my mum
and dad before.

193
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:24,920
Ohh.

194
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,339
My mum was amazing.

195
00:12:27,659 --> 00:12:28,728
Hm!

196
00:12:30,257 --> 00:12:33,416
Clever and funny.

197
00:12:33,576 --> 00:12:35,815
And strong. A really strong person.

198
00:12:37,374 --> 00:12:42,212
And my dad was kind and ambitious.

199
00:12:42,782 --> 00:12:43,861
Also funny,

200
00:12:43,891 --> 00:12:46,610
but more in a lovely
old-fashioned kind of way.

201
00:12:47,609 --> 00:12:49,519
What you see now

202
00:12:49,938 --> 00:12:53,387
is what 18 years of hell
does to someone.

203
00:12:55,526 --> 00:12:58,444
The grief, of course, the loss,
but, erm...

204
00:12:59,924 --> 00:13:02,443
..18 years of imagining

205
00:13:02,463 --> 00:13:05,071
what her last moments
might have been like.

206
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,718
18 years of stupid hope
that maybe she might still be alive.

207
00:13:13,078 --> 00:13:16,316
Of newspaper headlines,
of people backing away from you,

208
00:13:16,516 --> 00:13:18,715
of strangers
hugging you in the street.

209
00:13:22,114 --> 00:13:25,792
For my dad, 18 years of suspicion
that it was him.

210
00:13:27,551 --> 00:13:31,429
For my mum,
18 years of unspoken accusations

211
00:13:31,629 --> 00:13:33,828
that if she had been
a better mother,

212
00:13:33,988 --> 00:13:35,547
then this wouldn't have happened.

213
00:13:37,906 --> 00:13:41,145
18 years
of seeing her everywhere I go.

214
00:13:46,423 --> 00:13:47,822
So, er, yes.

215
00:13:50,461 --> 00:13:52,020
We are glad, so glad,

216
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:55,578
that we can bring her home
and lay her to rest,

217
00:13:55,778 --> 00:13:58,697
so that maybe we might have a chance
of rest ourselves.

218
00:14:01,616 --> 00:14:04,254
But don't expect us
to show that to you

219
00:14:04,414 --> 00:14:05,854
in ways that you might expect.

220
00:14:07,693 --> 00:14:11,491
We're different now to who we were,
and to everyone else.

221
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,370
I completely understand.

222
00:14:17,448 --> 00:14:18,448
Er...

223
00:14:20,607 --> 00:14:22,526
These are her diaries.

224
00:14:22,726 --> 00:14:26,564
The original investigation
obviously has copies of them, but...

225
00:14:26,724 --> 00:14:29,323
but these were who Hayley was.

226
00:14:30,682 --> 00:14:32,322
Not the minx
in the News Of The World,

227
00:14:32,521 --> 00:14:34,880
not the charity volunteer
in the Guardian.

228
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:39,318
She was just an ordinary girl

229
00:14:39,518 --> 00:14:42,877
who used to drink vodka
and swore a lot

230
00:14:43,077 --> 00:14:45,436
and sometimes
she was really irritating

231
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:47,555
and sometimes
she was fucking brilliant.

232
00:14:49,314 --> 00:14:53,832
Just... a normal 16-year-old girl
like I was.

233
00:14:55,671 --> 00:14:57,630
And I loved her so much.

234
00:15:02,108 --> 00:15:03,547
SHE CLEARS HER THROAT SOFTLY

235
00:15:05,866 --> 00:15:07,186
Thank you, Jessica.

236
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:10,104
Thanks.

237
00:15:14,502 --> 00:15:16,061
DOOR CLOSES

238
00:15:16,221 --> 00:15:17,541
SHE SIGHS

239
00:15:31,115 --> 00:15:34,353
Six will be perfect. Thanks so much.

240
00:15:34,513 --> 00:15:36,152
Bye now.

241
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:39,911
So, they have the parts
and they can do it in 20 minutes.

242
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:42,269
Do you know Lymmington Yard?
Yeah.

243
00:15:42,309 --> 00:15:46,148
Right, well, let's drive down there
together and get it fixed right now,

244
00:15:46,348 --> 00:15:49,306
and you have a photo of Frankie,
I can get some photocopies done,

245
00:15:49,506 --> 00:15:51,705
and you can stick them up
on all the trees and lampposts

246
00:15:51,865 --> 00:15:54,024
and whatever round here,
how's that sound?

247
00:15:55,703 --> 00:15:57,822
I'm so sorry, Tim.

248
00:15:57,862 --> 00:16:00,581
I'm so sorry
you had to come all this way.

249
00:16:00,781 --> 00:16:03,700
This is very simple stuff
and it's pathetic.

250
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:05,179
It was just too much.

251
00:16:05,379 --> 00:16:07,698
Mate, it was just bad luck.
Would have floored anyone.

252
00:16:07,858 --> 00:16:09,097
Don't be so hard on yourself.

253
00:16:09,257 --> 00:16:11,016
You're doing incredibly well

254
00:16:11,216 --> 00:16:13,055
and we're all
just really proud of you, OK?

255
00:16:13,215 --> 00:16:14,335
Come on.

256
00:16:22,091 --> 00:16:23,770
EXCITED CHEERING

257
00:16:28,089 --> 00:16:29,768
CHILDREN CHEER

258
00:16:32,686 --> 00:16:36,165
Hey, hey! There he is!
HE LAUGHS

259
00:16:36,325 --> 00:16:39,763
Ohh! Hello, Peanut.

260
00:16:39,963 --> 00:16:42,682
You said you weren't coming.
I know, but I bunked off work.

261
00:16:42,842 --> 00:16:44,441
Don't tell anyone. Where's Mum?

262
00:16:44,641 --> 00:16:47,040
Oh, she's over there,
talking to Felix's dad.

263
00:16:55,436 --> 00:16:58,435
Mum, Mum, Dad's here.
He's over there.

264
00:16:58,595 --> 00:16:59,594
Oh, yeah.

265
00:17:01,753 --> 00:17:05,351
Hey! This is a nice surprise.
Is it? Good.

266
00:17:05,551 --> 00:17:08,270
WOMAN: Next race, please.
Oh, that's me.

267
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:13,148
I stuck a cheque
in the joint account this morning.

268
00:17:13,348 --> 00:17:16,946
Couple of deals came through,
so... hope that helps.

269
00:17:17,106 --> 00:17:18,106
Thank you.

270
00:17:20,425 --> 00:17:22,584
Let's go and find a good spot.
Hm!

271
00:17:33,818 --> 00:17:34,898
I wrote that.

272
00:17:36,337 --> 00:17:37,457
I'm sorry?

273
00:17:37,617 --> 00:17:39,296
Top of the Glass.

274
00:17:39,456 --> 00:17:41,455
'92, I think it was.

275
00:17:41,615 --> 00:17:44,134
Not one of my better efforts.

276
00:17:44,334 --> 00:17:46,493
Huh.
KEYBOARD CLICKS

277
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:57,168
OK, I got, er, 50 of these done.
Should be enough.

278
00:17:57,328 --> 00:17:59,647
I spoke to Rob at your gallery.

279
00:17:59,847 --> 00:18:03,125
He says you still have another 6,000
lodged with him.

280
00:18:03,285 --> 00:18:04,284
Yeah.

281
00:18:04,484 --> 00:18:06,683
But if you need any more
for this deposit,

282
00:18:06,883 --> 00:18:09,962
which I think is a brilliant idea,
by the way, just give me a shout.

283
00:18:10,162 --> 00:18:12,841
You can always pay me back
when you sell your next paintings.

284
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,399
Thank you.

285
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:19,118
But I do think you should consider
if it's time to...

286
00:18:19,318 --> 00:18:21,277
well, to think about
opening a bank account aga...

287
00:18:21,357 --> 00:18:24,235
No. No... No...
No bank accounts, never. No, sorry.

288
00:18:26,154 --> 00:18:27,474
OK, it's your call.

289
00:18:30,153 --> 00:18:32,312
Look, I need to shoot. Erm...

290
00:18:32,512 --> 00:18:36,390
And we need to have this drink,
the four of us.

291
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:38,909
Well, I-I can ring Pete,
and maybe you ring Jamie.

292
00:18:39,069 --> 00:18:41,427
Deal. Look after yourself.

293
00:18:52,382 --> 00:18:54,901
We didn't actually get the call
till the following morning.

294
00:18:55,061 --> 00:18:56,381
Her parents had assumed

295
00:18:56,581 --> 00:18:58,740
that she'd gone
straight to the party after work.

296
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,739
The first inkling they had
that anything was wrong

297
00:19:00,939 --> 00:19:02,898
was when she wasn't in her bedroom
in the morning.

298
00:19:02,938 --> 00:19:05,057
And after you'd spoken to them...

299
00:19:07,456 --> 00:19:09,575
..what was your first instinct?

300
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:11,054
Mine or my guvnor's?

301
00:19:12,533 --> 00:19:13,733
Both?

302
00:19:13,933 --> 00:19:16,371
Well, for various reasons,
DCI Pearson believed

303
00:19:16,571 --> 00:19:18,491
she might have travelled
up to London that night,

304
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:19,770
possibly with her boyfriend.

305
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:22,489
And given where she was found,
he might have been right, but...

306
00:19:22,649 --> 00:19:24,768
I never really bought that idea.

307
00:19:24,928 --> 00:19:26,287
Because?

308
00:19:27,526 --> 00:19:30,085
There's nothing we learned
from speaking to her parents,

309
00:19:30,285 --> 00:19:34,083
her sister or any of her friends
suggested she was the sort of person

310
00:19:34,283 --> 00:19:37,482
who would have just upped sticks
like that without telling anyone.

311
00:19:37,642 --> 00:19:39,481
And where was her sister that night?

312
00:19:39,681 --> 00:19:42,240
She was at another party
ten miles away. She slept over.

313
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:46,997
And in the end, DCI Pearson
came round to thinking same as you?

314
00:19:47,157 --> 00:19:48,277
In the end, yeah.

315
00:19:49,476 --> 00:19:53,075
But we lost five days
to her being treated as a runaway,

316
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:55,474
time when we could have had
search teams out,

317
00:19:55,674 --> 00:19:57,872
thermal imaging cameras,
press appeals.

318
00:19:59,672 --> 00:20:01,391
Yeah, we lost a lot of momentum.

319
00:20:11,026 --> 00:20:12,626
I don't know what to say.

320
00:20:12,786 --> 00:20:14,745
What SHOULD I say? I just...

321
00:20:16,344 --> 00:20:18,503
Maybe you don't have to say
anything.

322
00:20:19,543 --> 00:20:22,581
Maybe you don't always have to talk.

323
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:27,339
I just...

324
00:20:27,539 --> 00:20:31,737
I really do wanna try to understand.
I mean, is this...?

325
00:20:31,777 --> 00:20:35,215
Do you just wanna dress like this,
or...? Or...

326
00:20:36,855 --> 00:20:38,734
..do I want to cut my cock off?

327
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:47,650
I don't know.

328
00:20:51,488 --> 00:20:53,207
I just know
that one day I wanna wake up

329
00:20:53,367 --> 00:20:54,527
and maybe not feel different.

330
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:58,205
Why don't I take the rest of the day
off and...? No, no, no.

331
00:20:58,405 --> 00:21:01,283
Please, it might help just to...
Dad, this isn't about the past.

332
00:21:04,082 --> 00:21:06,601
Or at least not the past
you're talking about.

333
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,119
I'm just a fuck-up.
No.

334
00:21:14,917 --> 00:21:16,077
And I always was.

335
00:21:18,955 --> 00:21:20,675
Eliot, don't go.
I'll see you later.

336
00:21:22,594 --> 00:21:24,993
I love you.
I love you, too.

337
00:21:28,231 --> 00:21:31,750
So... how did the boyfriend
fit into all of this?

338
00:21:33,069 --> 00:21:34,908
Well, Hayley
had started going out with him

339
00:21:35,108 --> 00:21:38,067
in the September
just before her 16th,

340
00:21:38,267 --> 00:21:39,786
and Dave Pearson
got it into his head

341
00:21:39,986 --> 00:21:42,185
that because Mullery was 23,
that their...

342
00:21:42,385 --> 00:21:44,744
well, there was something abusive
about their relationship.

343
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:48,702
But you didn't feel that?
No, not really.

344
00:21:48,902 --> 00:21:51,940
He looked a lot younger
than he was, he acted younger,

345
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,939
and Hayley
was quite mature for her age,

346
00:21:54,139 --> 00:21:56,538
so I just thought
they kind of met in the middle.

347
00:21:56,738 --> 00:21:58,897
We also never found
a shred of evidence

348
00:21:58,937 --> 00:22:01,936
to suggest that
she'd been in his car that night.

349
00:22:02,096 --> 00:22:05,094
So when he was discounted,

350
00:22:05,294 --> 00:22:07,453
what were your main lines
of enquiry?

351
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:10,132
Again, DCI Pearson's theories,

352
00:22:10,332 --> 00:22:13,570
that maybe she hadn't travelled up
to London that night with Mullery,

353
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:15,609
but that she'd hitched up there,
to follow him,

354
00:22:15,809 --> 00:22:17,609
and that whoever picked her up
had killed her.

355
00:22:17,728 --> 00:22:20,567
Or that she'd got to London safely
but had been unable to find him

356
00:22:20,767 --> 00:22:24,525
and some random stranger
had killed her there.

357
00:22:24,725 --> 00:22:28,164
Did you ever find any evidence
that she HAD travelled to London?

358
00:22:28,324 --> 00:22:29,723
No.

359
00:22:29,883 --> 00:22:31,602
So then we started exploring

360
00:22:31,802 --> 00:22:34,401
whether she might actually have
gone home straight after her shift

361
00:22:34,601 --> 00:22:38,119
and that her father had murdered her
after some sort of domestic row.

362
00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:41,158
And her mum wasn't home that night?

363
00:22:41,358 --> 00:22:44,796
No, she was working at a local pub
between nine and one,

364
00:22:44,996 --> 00:22:47,515
so the timing
could have worked, but...

365
00:22:47,715 --> 00:22:50,993
we never found any evidence
of any altercation at the house,

366
00:22:51,193 --> 00:22:54,272
there was no apparent history
of any fighting,

367
00:22:54,472 --> 00:22:56,431
and there was no evidence
of anything darker,

368
00:22:56,591 --> 00:22:58,950
like abuse or anything like that.

369
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:00,269
What about other locals?

370
00:23:00,469 --> 00:23:02,028
Yeah,
we looked at the other boyfriends,

371
00:23:02,188 --> 00:23:04,307
but they all had good alibis,

372
00:23:04,347 --> 00:23:08,585
so then we looked at all local men
within a 30-mile radius

373
00:23:08,785 --> 00:23:10,424
who were on
the Sexual Offenders Register,

374
00:23:10,584 --> 00:23:12,144
but they all had
watertight alibis, too.

375
00:23:12,264 --> 00:23:13,583
It was the Millennium,

376
00:23:13,783 --> 00:23:17,061
so a lot of people spent those hours
in very public places.

377
00:23:17,221 --> 00:23:19,100
It was another complete blank.

378
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,439
HE SIGHS
What can I say?

379
00:23:24,098 --> 00:23:26,217
We let Hayley and her family down...

380
00:23:27,547 --> 00:23:30,345
..and I remain... deeply ashamed

381
00:23:30,415 --> 00:23:32,584
of the way
the case was handled initially.

382
00:23:45,628 --> 00:23:48,427
Right, I'm gonna head on up, Guv.
Mm.

383
00:23:48,627 --> 00:23:51,785
I might have a wander, get a feel
for the place. Not tired.

384
00:23:51,945 --> 00:23:53,665
No worries. See you in the morning.

385
00:23:53,864 --> 00:23:55,704
Yeah, night, Sunny.
Night.

386
00:24:41,443 --> 00:24:42,882
So there's absolutely no evidence

387
00:24:43,082 --> 00:24:45,041
suggesting she did travel
up to London that night.

388
00:24:45,121 --> 00:24:46,211
No.
Similarly,

389
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:51,208
there's an odd lack of any leads
connecting her to someone here.

390
00:24:51,358 --> 00:24:52,398
Yeah.
So...

391
00:24:54,277 --> 00:24:57,635
..what if she was brought
up to London already dead?

392
00:24:58,915 --> 00:25:02,033
Killed down here and then
disposed of in London? Yeah.

393
00:25:02,233 --> 00:25:07,951
Why would someone do that, drive
80, 90 miles to dispose of a body?

394
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:11,709
Because you bury people
somewhere you know,

395
00:25:11,909 --> 00:25:14,188
an... an environment
you feel comfortable in.

396
00:25:14,388 --> 00:25:17,266
You think the killer's from London?
Near the burial site, probably.

397
00:25:17,466 --> 00:25:19,705
And drove down here
specifically to kill?

398
00:25:19,905 --> 00:25:22,384
No. I think
they might have already been here.

399
00:25:23,903 --> 00:25:25,023
In a holiday rental.

400
00:25:26,222 --> 00:25:28,781
OK, after Easter and summer,

401
00:25:28,981 --> 00:25:32,020
Christmas and New Year will be
the busiest time for holiday lets.

402
00:25:32,219 --> 00:25:34,378
My brother does it every year
with his family,

403
00:25:34,418 --> 00:25:36,178
heads down day after Boxing Day,

404
00:25:36,338 --> 00:25:38,537
stays, dunno, four or five days,

405
00:25:38,696 --> 00:25:41,575
heads back... 2nd, 3rd, 4th.

406
00:25:41,735 --> 00:25:43,854
Right. Right, right.

407
00:25:43,894 --> 00:25:45,094
Don't you think...

408
00:25:46,693 --> 00:25:50,291
..packing a dead body with
the wellies and the dirty washing

409
00:25:50,491 --> 00:25:52,850
would be a bit tricky?
Mm.

410
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:54,489
If they were with family, yeah,

411
00:25:54,689 --> 00:25:57,688
yeah, maybe that part needs
finessing, but the...

412
00:25:59,367 --> 00:26:01,366
..the basic idea?
Yeah, it's a theory.

413
00:26:01,526 --> 00:26:02,526
Mm.

414
00:26:05,004 --> 00:26:07,203
Anyway, maybe sleep on it.

415
00:26:07,403 --> 00:26:11,841
Nice PJs, by the way.
Very... snazzy.

416
00:26:12,001 --> 00:26:13,161
Night.

417
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:14,520

00:26:18,718 --> 00:26:21,557

they're just parking up.

SHE SIGHS

420
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:24,675
All the papers have it.

421
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:28,834
The Sun has an interview
with a friend of the dad.

422
00:26:28,993 --> 00:26:30,553

about an hour ago.

00:26:33,711 --> 00:26:36,270
Does anyone care that we haven't
actually confirmed it's her yet?

425
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:38,549
It's not really about Hayley
for them, though, is it?

Yeah, not a problem.

468
00:29:03,563 --> 00:29:05,882
BEEP
Els, it's me. I just...

469
00:29:07,521 --> 00:29:09,800
C... Can you call me, please?

470
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:13,118
I want to know that you're OK.

471
00:29:13,278 --> 00:29:14,558
Love you.

472
00:29:19,036 --> 00:29:21,874
Cos Mum had said he was always
nice as pie when I was there.

473
00:29:22,074 --> 00:29:26,272
I... I pretended to go out,
I said I was going shopping,

474
00:29:26,312 --> 00:29:28,831
and closed the front door,
but, erm...

475
00:29:29,031 --> 00:29:31,390
actually,
I just went into the kitchen,

476
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:33,669
which was next to her room.

477
00:29:33,829 --> 00:29:36,867
OK, and what did you hear there?

478
00:29:37,067 --> 00:29:40,546
Well, I heard my mum
being a pain in the bum,

479
00:29:40,706 --> 00:29:42,825
which she could be, fair play.

480
00:29:44,184 --> 00:29:48,782
And then I-I...
I just heard him go for her.

481
00:29:50,181 --> 00:29:52,500
And how do you mean "go for her",
Mrs Pinion?

482
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,899
Well, not... not like he...
he lost it or anything.

483
00:29:55,099 --> 00:29:57,258
He never raised his voice,
he just...

484
00:29:58,258 --> 00:30:04,295
He had this really... calm,
quiet way of talking,

485
00:30:04,495 --> 00:30:09,213
and he just kept telling her
what a horrible old bitch she was...

486
00:30:10,372 --> 00:30:12,611
..what a... what a burden.

487
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:17,049
And... at one point
I definitely heard him say

488
00:30:17,249 --> 00:30:21,007
that he was going to give her
an overdose to be rid of her...

489
00:30:22,806 --> 00:30:24,606
..cos she was so much trouble...

490
00:30:27,164 --> 00:30:28,964
MRS PINION SNIFFS

491
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:38,959
So, we've spoken to every lettings
agency within a five-mile radius.

492
00:30:39,159 --> 00:30:41,918
There are approximately
380 properties in this area

493
00:30:42,078 --> 00:30:43,917
available for rental at New Year.

494
00:30:44,077 --> 00:30:45,356
Right.

495
00:30:45,516 --> 00:30:47,275
Average adult occupancy is four,

496
00:30:47,475 --> 00:30:50,394
so...
knock off half cos they're women,

497
00:30:50,594 --> 00:30:54,472
you've got about 750
possible male suspects.

498
00:30:56,871 --> 00:30:58,030
Boss.

499
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:59,909
DNA's confirmed that it's Hayley.

500
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:05,027
OK.

501
00:31:05,187 --> 00:31:09,905
And, er, Andrews wants you
to make a holding statement.

502
00:31:10,065 --> 00:31:11,584
Here?

503
00:31:11,784 --> 00:31:13,943
Yeah, the press office
are gonna send you something.

504
00:31:13,983 --> 00:31:15,542
SHE SIGHS
Right.

505
00:31:18,021 --> 00:31:21,739
OK, erm, can you contact
Jessica and the parents,

506
00:31:21,899 --> 00:31:23,699
let them know about the ID?

507
00:31:23,898 --> 00:31:27,417
Fran, you speak to the press.
Tell them 15 minutes.

508
00:31:27,617 --> 00:31:30,176
And do you want us to start pulling
together lettings information

509
00:31:30,296 --> 00:31:31,375
for the Millennium?

510
00:31:31,535 --> 00:31:33,254
No, hold fire for now.

511
00:31:34,454 --> 00:31:36,213
Can you find me a printer I can use?

512
00:31:36,373 --> 00:31:38,212
OK, Guv.

513
00:31:38,412 --> 00:31:41,171
I won't keep you long, Mrs Pinion,
just three quick questions.

514
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:42,930
How many other allegations
have you made

515
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:45,489
against GPs in Dr Finch's practice?

516
00:31:45,689 --> 00:31:47,528
Two, but...
Thank you.

517
00:31:47,728 --> 00:31:50,286
And how many other practices
have you been banned from

518
00:31:50,486 --> 00:31:52,925
in the Hamhurst region
for making repeated complaints?

519
00:31:53,125 --> 00:31:55,644
I left them.
How many?

520
00:31:57,123 --> 00:31:58,363
A couple.

521
00:31:58,563 --> 00:32:01,641
I think the record will show
it's actually four.

522
00:32:01,841 --> 00:32:04,000
And last question -
in how many instances

523
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:06,639
have you attempted
to achieve a financial settlement

524
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,518
before a tribunal hearing?

525
00:32:10,157 --> 00:32:11,317
Perhaps I can help here.

526
00:32:11,477 --> 00:32:12,956
It's all of them, isn't it?

527
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:16,275
Thank you.

528
00:32:21,472 --> 00:32:23,471
Pete's not in the office
at the moment, I'm afraid,

529
00:32:23,671 --> 00:32:25,830
Ms Salthouse, but I'm his PA,
perhaps I can help you.

530
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:27,669
'Well, I certainly hope so.'

531
00:32:27,869 --> 00:32:31,428
Your salesman Mr Carr sold my father
a cash ISA the other day,

532
00:32:31,587 --> 00:32:34,146
and we want to cancel it, please.

533
00:32:34,346 --> 00:32:36,505
It's still within
the 14-day timeframe.

534
00:32:36,545 --> 00:32:37,665
'OK, can I just ask why?'

535
00:32:37,865 --> 00:32:40,703
He doesn't need a cash ISA,
and Carr should have known that.

536
00:32:40,903 --> 00:32:44,542
Right, OK, if you could just hang on
a sec and I'll dig out the...

537
00:32:44,701 --> 00:32:46,061
Erm...

538
00:32:46,261 --> 00:32:48,780
When was it your father saw him,
Ms Salthouse?

539
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:50,219
I can't see any paperwork here.

540
00:32:50,419 --> 00:32:52,618
'Monday, and it's definitely
all gone through.

541
00:32:52,818 --> 00:32:54,417
'The cheque was cashed
this morning.'

542
00:32:54,577 --> 00:32:56,216
Right, OK, well, no worries...

543
00:32:59,295 --> 00:33:01,854
Good afternoon.
I'd like to make a brief statement.

544
00:33:02,054 --> 00:33:03,933
I'll not be answering questions
today,

545
00:33:04,133 --> 00:33:07,091
but we will be holding a more
detailed press conference in London

546
00:33:07,251 --> 00:33:08,291
in due course.

547
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:12,209
I can now confirm

548
00:33:12,249 --> 00:33:17,367
that the remains of the young woman
found in north London four days ago

549
00:33:17,526 --> 00:33:21,525
were those of Hayley Louise Reid.

550
00:33:21,725 --> 00:33:26,882
Her parents, Gordon and Suzanne,
have been informed of this...

551
00:33:28,721 --> 00:33:31,440
..and on behalf
of the Metropolitan Police,

552
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:36,918
we would like to offer our deepest
sympathy to them and their family.

553
00:33:38,037 --> 00:33:41,515
The investigation into
Hayley's death has been reopened...

554
00:33:42,635 --> 00:33:45,074
..and I want to assure
the Reid family

555
00:33:45,234 --> 00:33:47,233
and the wider community

556
00:33:47,433 --> 00:33:50,511
that we will now turn
all of our very best efforts

557
00:33:50,711 --> 00:33:53,670
to finding the person responsible
for this dreadful crime.

558
00:33:55,989 --> 00:33:58,668
Thank you very much.
REPORTERS CLAMOUR

559
00:33:58,868 --> 00:34:00,827
Have the police
made any formal apologises?

560
00:34:01,027 --> 00:34:03,226
DCI Stuart,
why are the police so shit?

561
00:34:03,385 --> 00:34:04,385
ROOM FALLS SILENT

562
00:34:06,664 --> 00:34:08,623
MAN: Did you get that?

563
00:34:10,142 --> 00:34:11,982
What a wanker.

564
00:34:12,181 --> 00:34:15,780
He just wanted a good photo.
I shouldn't have reacted.

565
00:34:20,138 --> 00:34:22,057
WOMAN: DCI Stuart?

566
00:34:22,257 --> 00:34:25,695
She said no questions. What part
of that do you not understand?

567
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:27,614
I'm... I'm not press.

568
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:29,254
Hayley was a friend of mine.

569
00:34:29,454 --> 00:34:31,053
And there's something
I need to tell you.

570
00:34:33,652 --> 00:34:37,930
18 years ago, two days
before Hayley went missing...

571
00:34:39,449 --> 00:34:41,608
..when I was supposed to be doing
a cleaning job...

572
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:47,006
..I was actually in the park
meeting a lad...

573
00:34:48,725 --> 00:34:51,443
..and Hayley, who was a mate...

574
00:34:52,643 --> 00:34:54,562
..did the job for me.

575
00:34:55,682 --> 00:34:58,760
I genuinely... didn't think

576
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,119
the information would be useful
to the investigation,

577
00:35:01,159 --> 00:35:02,878
but I knew if my parents
had have found out,

578
00:35:03,038 --> 00:35:06,716
I'd have been in such deep shit,
so I never told anyone.

579
00:35:09,275 --> 00:35:10,405
Over the years,

580
00:35:10,435 --> 00:35:13,733
I always wondered whether
the information might be relevant.

581
00:35:15,552 --> 00:35:18,911
But... every year that went past,

582
00:35:19,111 --> 00:35:22,189
the easier it became...
to bury it...

583
00:35:23,469 --> 00:35:29,396
...this little... nagging voice
saying I should tell someone.

584
00:35:30,226 --> 00:35:34,024
Oh, and then today, one of
your officers came in to our office,

585
00:35:34,224 --> 00:35:37,302
asking about
our 1999 holiday lettings...

586
00:35:39,501 --> 00:35:41,900
..and my stomach turned...

587
00:35:45,019 --> 00:35:47,338
..because...

588
00:35:47,498 --> 00:35:48,577
the cleaning job...

589
00:35:50,097 --> 00:35:51,736
..it was in a holiday rental.

590
00:36:16,704 --> 00:36:18,264
KNOCK ON DOOR

591
00:36:24,601 --> 00:36:26,760
The property
was called The Spinney,

592
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,779
and she thinks
it's still on the books

593
00:36:28,799 --> 00:36:31,358
of an agency
called Durrell & Martin.

594
00:36:31,428 --> 00:36:33,587
They were one of the ones
we spoke to earlier.

595
00:36:33,637 --> 00:36:36,375
'Well, speak to them again,
call me back.' OK, Guv.

596
00:36:46,211 --> 00:36:49,769
The last 24 hours just made me see
really that it was naive of me

597
00:36:49,969 --> 00:36:53,927
to think that I could live
a normal life with you and Asif,

598
00:36:54,127 --> 00:36:56,046
more importantly
that I could look after you both

599
00:36:56,166 --> 00:37:00,364
when, obviously, I'm still
struggling to look after myself.

600
00:37:02,254 --> 00:37:07,051
Well, I wish now
I'd not... hesitated when you asked

601
00:37:07,321 --> 00:37:09,960
and maybe missed
a wonderful opportunity.

602
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,279
It's OK.
You know, you don't need to.

603
00:37:12,319 --> 00:37:14,208
And the only reason
that I did pause...

604
00:37:16,167 --> 00:37:18,536
..was because I never thought
you saw me that way.

605
00:37:21,305 --> 00:37:23,814
And, of course,
I know you struggle...

606
00:37:24,004 --> 00:37:26,163
SHE SIGHS
..but I do, too.

607
00:37:28,921 --> 00:37:31,990
I think we both have things
in our past that have hurt us.

608
00:37:34,339 --> 00:37:36,738
But I also know
you're a good person, Chris.

609
00:37:37,987 --> 00:37:39,187
Kind...

610
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:43,065
..and generous

611
00:37:43,225 --> 00:37:45,344
and clever...

612
00:37:45,444 --> 00:37:46,923
who Asif adores.

613
00:37:50,831 --> 00:37:52,631
And, actually,
I would feel very lucky

614
00:37:52,681 --> 00:37:54,660
to be able
to help you grow stronger,

615
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,399
to look after you for a time...

616
00:37:58,218 --> 00:38:00,457
..so that one day soon enough
I'm sure...

617
00:38:01,726 --> 00:38:03,685
..you would be able
to look after us.

618
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:17,289
Mila!

619
00:38:18,489 --> 00:38:20,208
Mila.

620
00:38:20,368 --> 00:38:22,487
Beautiful girl.

621
00:38:23,646 --> 00:38:25,046
You have no idea.

622
00:38:28,884 --> 00:38:31,563
DOG BARKS

623
00:38:31,723 --> 00:38:34,361
It's Frank. Frank's back!

624
00:38:34,521 --> 00:38:35,841
THEY LAUGH

625
00:38:39,639 --> 00:38:41,278
Paper?
INDISTINCT REPLY

626
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:00,030
All of it?

627
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:02,908
Pete, it was three grand.
Exactly!

628
00:39:03,068 --> 00:39:05,027
Oh! The boiler will be two...

629
00:39:06,627 --> 00:39:09,186
..we haven't paid any bills
since October,

630
00:39:09,385 --> 00:39:11,544
and both the boys
needed winter clothes.

631
00:39:11,584 --> 00:39:14,503
Right, sure,
but I'm surprised at the...

632
00:39:14,663 --> 00:39:16,302
Surprised at what?

633
00:39:16,462 --> 00:39:18,021
This isn't Hong Kong, you know,

634
00:39:18,221 --> 00:39:22,419
whatever weird, endlessly delayed
adolescence you lived over there,

635
00:39:22,459 --> 00:39:25,258
which, frankly, freaks me out
the more I think about it.

636
00:39:25,458 --> 00:39:28,297
This is your life now,
and it costs money, constantly,

637
00:39:28,497 --> 00:39:31,455
which has to be earned,
with hard work, constantly.

638
00:39:33,334 --> 00:39:35,254
It's been six years, Pete.

639
00:39:35,413 --> 00:39:37,253
You have responsibilities.

640
00:39:37,413 --> 00:39:39,332
Start living up to them.

641
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:45,569
Dad, we discussed it last night.
We absolutely did not.

642
00:39:45,769 --> 00:39:48,448
You said you could do the afternoon,
but you couldn't do the morning

643
00:39:48,488 --> 00:39:50,087
because Jenny
had a doctor's appointment.

644
00:39:50,287 --> 00:39:52,486
That's why
I booked the plumber for two.

645
00:39:52,686 --> 00:39:54,965
I suppose there's no chance
it was YOU who made a mistake?

646
00:39:55,084 --> 00:39:56,844
I suppose
it always has to be my fault?

647
00:39:57,044 --> 00:39:59,602
Oh! Fine, forget about it.
I'll get him to come Saturday.

648
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,919
So what did you guys get up to
today?

649
00:40:11,637 --> 00:40:14,116
We went clothes shopping.
Mm.

650
00:40:14,316 --> 00:40:16,675
Early birthday pressie for Jenny.
Very nice.

651
00:40:18,074 --> 00:40:20,553
She like Primark, too, does she?

652
00:40:20,713 --> 00:40:21,792
Harvey Nick's, actually.

653
00:40:21,952 --> 00:40:23,232
Bloody hell, Dad,

654
00:40:23,432 --> 00:40:26,070
she does know you have
a heart condition, doesn't she?

655
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:28,709
Actually, it was my idea.

656
00:40:28,909 --> 00:40:30,748
And, tell you what,
it was really nice

657
00:40:30,908 --> 00:40:32,347
to be able to treat someone again.

658
00:40:32,507 --> 00:40:33,747
Yeah, I bet.

659
00:40:33,907 --> 00:40:35,426
She's a lucky woman.

660
00:40:35,586 --> 00:40:36,625
Not as lucky as me.

661
00:40:36,825 --> 00:40:39,064
You hungry?
Starving.

662
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:50,139
I'd forgotten
that's who we let it to.

663
00:40:50,299 --> 00:40:51,819
James Hollis?

664
00:40:51,978 --> 00:40:54,657
That's THE James Hollis, the TV guy.

665
00:40:54,817 --> 00:40:56,296
I don't watch a lot of television.

666
00:40:56,456 --> 00:40:58,575
Well, he's mainly a journalist,

667
00:40:58,615 --> 00:41:02,094
but he also does that quiz show
on the BBC.

668
00:41:03,493 --> 00:41:06,852
SHE CHUCKLES
Well, anyway, that's him.

669
00:41:07,012 --> 00:41:09,730
Took The Spinney for the Millennium

670
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:13,449
from the 27th to the 2nd, erm...

671
00:41:13,649 --> 00:41:15,528
along with...
yeah, three other families.

672
00:41:17,367 --> 00:41:20,685
Do you mind if I get a copy of that,
please? Yeah.

673
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,039
SHE SIGHS

674
00:41:36,438 --> 00:41:38,277
Boss.

675
00:41:38,437 --> 00:41:39,677
Hey.

676
00:41:39,837 --> 00:41:42,715
Oh, man, a teenager's diary.

677
00:41:42,915 --> 00:41:46,314
So much angst, so much joy.
Mm.

678
00:41:46,513 --> 00:41:49,122
Yeah, I flicked through it last
night. It's not an easy read, is it?

679
00:41:49,152 --> 00:41:50,792
No. What's up?

680
00:41:50,991 --> 00:41:53,270
Murray found the bloke
who rented the house.

681
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:54,750
Oh, wow, good work.
Yeah.

682
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:57,588
And he only lives,
er, 15-minute walk from here,

683
00:41:57,788 --> 00:41:59,787
so I thought why don't we just
head down there now?

684
00:42:00,907 --> 00:42:02,826
What, NOW now?
Yeah, why not?

685
00:42:04,065 --> 00:42:05,745
Yeah, why not.

686
00:42:08,583 --> 00:42:10,582
Guess who it is.
Who?

687
00:42:10,782 --> 00:42:14,181
James Hollis.
What, the, er, writer guy?

688
00:42:14,341 --> 00:42:15,340
Yep.

689
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:16,740
The TV guy?
Yeah!

690
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:17,899
Blimey.

691
00:42:19,298 --> 00:42:21,258
My mum used to love him.

692
00:42:21,457 --> 00:42:24,016
"Thinking woman's muffin",
she always called him.

693
00:42:24,216 --> 00:42:28,414
I'd say, "Mum, it's crumpet,"
and she'd say, "I know what I mean."

694
00:42:30,573 --> 00:42:32,772
I don't even know why that's funny.

695
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:43,940
BELL TINKLES

696
00:43:45,059 --> 00:43:46,139
I'll get it.

697
00:44:00,452 --> 00:44:04,130
Hello. Have we got the right address
for James Hollis, please?

698
00:44:05,650 --> 00:44:07,809
Thank you, Lin.

699
00:44:07,969 --> 00:44:09,288
Hello?

700
00:44:09,448 --> 00:44:10,648
Hi, Mr Hollis?

701
00:44:10,847 --> 00:44:15,245
Yes.
DCI Cass Stuart and DI Sunny Khan.

702
00:44:15,445 --> 00:44:18,044
We wondered
if you had five minutes, please,

703
00:44:18,244 --> 00:44:19,923
to help us with a case
we're investigating.

704
00:44:20,043 --> 00:44:21,083
What case?

705
00:44:21,283 --> 00:44:24,161
Er... Well,
it's an historical murder case,

706
00:44:24,361 --> 00:44:28,359
and we just wanted to ask
some questions

707
00:44:28,519 --> 00:44:30,199
about a house we believe you rented

708
00:44:30,398 --> 00:44:33,997
near Middenham
in late December 1999.

709
00:44:35,436 --> 00:44:37,035
I will be more than happy

710
00:44:37,235 --> 00:44:39,474
to answer absolutely any questions
you want to ask me,

711
00:44:39,674 --> 00:44:41,673
but I will need my lawyer present,
I'm afraid.

712
00:44:41,833 --> 00:44:44,072
Oh, OK.

713
00:44:44,232 --> 00:44:45,711
It's really just an informal chat.

714
00:44:45,911 --> 00:44:47,791
We're trying to get
some background information.

715
00:44:47,990 --> 00:44:50,589
Give me your card and I'll get
my lawyer to make an appointment.

716
00:44:50,749 --> 00:44:52,508
No problem.

717
00:44:52,708 --> 00:44:55,027
There you go.
As soon as you can, please.

718
00:44:55,187 --> 00:44:57,066
Absolutely. Thank you. Bye-bye.

719
00:45:01,584 --> 00:45:03,543
SHE CLEARS HER THROAT

720
00:45:04,863 --> 00:45:06,862
Interesting.
Very.

721
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:12,739
Who was it?

722
00:45:15,798 --> 00:45:17,997
Amazon. A book I ordered.

723
00:45:23,534 --> 00:45:25,013
Els, it's Dad again.

724
00:45:30,491 --> 00:45:32,090
It's happened, sweetheart.

725
00:45:33,650 --> 00:45:36,768
They've come. The police.

726
00:45:38,607 --> 00:45:39,807
About her.

726
00:45:40,305 --> 00:46:40,175
