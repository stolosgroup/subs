1
00:00:00,288 --> 00:00:01,847
So, have you spoken to your dad
again?

2
00:00:01,848 --> 00:00:04,287
- No. Spoke to a lawyer, though.
- A lawyer?

3
00:00:04,288 --> 00:00:05,687
I can't lose this anger, John.

4
00:00:05,688 --> 00:00:09,407
First theory - a chase
that went accidentally wrong.

5
00:00:09,408 --> 00:00:12,247
Second theory -
this was a very violent murder.

6
00:00:12,248 --> 00:00:15,208
- What if they find out about the pub?
- They won't find out about the pub.

7
00:00:15,209 --> 00:00:16,567
They might find out everything.

8
00:00:16,568 --> 00:00:19,287
They said I was speeding.
I killed a child.

9
00:00:19,288 --> 00:00:21,007
If that blood test
had come back positive,

10
00:00:21,008 --> 00:00:23,807
- Fiona Grayson would be in jail.
- It was lost.

11
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:26,727
Three weeks before Matthew
disappeared, he committed an ABH

12
00:00:26,728 --> 00:00:28,087
on Ram Sidhu.

13
00:00:28,088 --> 00:00:30,448
I've been trying to speak to you
for the last 24 hours, Ram.

14
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:32,127
I'm doing a blood test in an hour.

15
00:00:32,128 --> 00:00:34,407
You never told me
the police had interviewed you.

16
00:00:34,408 --> 00:00:37,767
- I can't take the secrets and lies.
- We will do this, but not now.

17
00:00:37,768 --> 00:00:40,408
- I think we pull Sidhu in now.
- You don't think we should wait...

18
00:00:40,409 --> 00:00:41,887
No. Let's get him in now, please.

19
00:00:41,888 --> 00:00:44,527
A witness comes out 30 years after
the event and says

20
00:00:44,528 --> 00:00:46,567
he saw an Asian guy,
are you serious?

21
00:00:46,568 --> 00:00:48,488
- I think we're done here.
- I just want it over.

22
00:00:48,489 --> 00:00:49,609
I shouldn't even be here.

23

- Monty?

32
00:02:12,568 --> 00:02:14,047
Lovely Monty.

33
00:02:14,048 --> 00:02:16,287
- She's alive?
- Very much so, apparently.

34
00:02:16,288 --> 00:02:18,767
- He's seeing her in the morning.
- Nice one.

35
00:02:18,768 --> 00:02:21,327
You look knackered, boss.

36
00:02:21,328 --> 00:02:23,607
- Thank you.
- I meant "go home".

37
00:02:23,608 --> 00:02:25,047
I'm trying.

38
00:02:25,048 --> 00:02:26,647
Oh, Guy, sorry...

39
00:02:26,648 --> 00:02:30,047
You know the documents thing
for Dean Barton?

40
00:02:30,048 --> 00:02:33,487
- Turns out he changed his surname.
- Wow. When and why?

41
00:02:33,488 --> 00:02:35,847
About three months before he applied
to Hendon. OK.

42
00:02:35,848 --> 00:02:39,607
Changed it by deed poll.
His real name is Dean Quinn.

43
00:02:39,608 --> 00:02:43,007
I'll run it through PNC,
maybe that'll tell us why.

44
00:02:43,008 --> 00:02:45,167
Good stuff.
Let me know if you get anything.

45
00:02:45,168 --> 00:02:46,288
Yeah. Night, boss.

46
00:02:47,248 --> 00:02:49,647
This is why you changed your mind?

47
00:02:49,648 --> 00:02:52,687
Because you think you might
be in jail on a murder charge?

48
00:02:52,688 --> 00:02:56,087
Listen. First of all,
I didn't do anything.

49
00:02:56,088 --> 00:02:58,807
If you didn't do anything,
why do you look so scared?

50
00:02:58,808 --> 00:03:01,807
Oh, why am I ever scared
when I'm getting investigated, Anna?

51
00:03:01,808 --> 00:03:05,687
- What murder? Who? Where?
- It was three decades ago.

52
00:03:05,688 --> 00:03:08,087
They have no evidence,
and like I said,

53
00:03:08,088 --> 00:03:09,767
- I didn't do anything.
- Who?

54
00:03:09,768 --> 00:03:11,647
Some...

55
00:03:11,648 --> 00:03:14,447
small time drug dealer.
They found his preserved body

56
00:03:14,448 --> 00:03:16,007
- a week or so ago.
- I saw that story.

57
00:03:16,008 --> 00:03:18,367
OK, so...

58
00:03:18,368 --> 00:03:21,127
This weird connection
between the victim

59
00:03:21,128 --> 00:03:22,927
- and a car I was in.
- A real connection?

60
00:03:22,928 --> 00:03:24,568
- Yeah, but...
- What connection?!

61
00:03:25,888 --> 00:03:28,488
They think his body
was in the back of the car.

62
00:03:30,608 --> 00:03:32,087
Oh, my God.

63
00:03:32,088 --> 00:03:35,448
But if it was, I had no idea.
And I swear...

64
00:03:36,888 --> 00:03:41,448
...Anna, I had nothing to do
with any murder.

65
00:03:47,088 --> 00:03:52,487
But, yes, I am scared, as always,
because I'm a problem for them,

66
00:03:52,488 --> 00:03:54,807
always have been,
and I genuinely believe

67
00:03:54,808 --> 00:03:56,648
they could use this to get rid of me
for good.

68
00:04:00,888 --> 00:04:02,368
I don't know, Ram.

69
00:04:03,767 --> 00:04:05,607
I just know this is one more thing
to cope with

70
00:04:05,608 --> 00:04:08,088
at the hardest moment
of my entire life.

71
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:11,248
PHONE RINGS

72
00:04:17,554 --> 00:04:18,554
Caz.

73
00:04:18,555 --> 00:04:21,007
<i>So I've found
nothing for Dean Quinn,</i>

74
00:04:21,008 --> 00:04:23,487
but lots for a Peter Quinn.

75
00:04:23,488 --> 00:04:25,807
Date of birth 1949,

76
00:04:25,808 --> 00:04:28,207
with his birth certificate
detailing him having four sons,

77
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:29,487
with one of them called Dean.

78
00:04:29,488 --> 00:04:32,567
Mm. And when you say "lots"?

79
00:04:32,568 --> 00:04:36,807
Drugs, prostitution, extortion,
lots of violence.

80
00:04:36,808 --> 00:04:38,527
I mean, he's spent half his life
inside.

81
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:40,727
Jesus. How was the father's record
not spotted?

82
00:04:40,728 --> 00:04:42,927
Yeah, well, the name change
obviously helped.

83
00:04:42,928 --> 00:04:46,007
But Dean's application wasn't sent
from the family home address either,

84
00:04:46,008 --> 00:04:48,207
<i>so he was obviously trying to avoid
just that.</i>

85
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:50,687
<i>But it wasn't just the father
at it, either.</i>

86
00:04:50,688 --> 00:04:52,967
Two of Dean's brothers
have long records as well,

87
00:04:52,968 --> 00:04:55,608
- so it's clearly a family business.
- Hm.

88
00:04:57,608 --> 00:04:59,528
OK, good work, Caz.

89
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:04,688
- Now, go home. G'night.
<i>- Night, boss.</i>

90
00:05:14,128 --> 00:05:16,527
What do you mean
you're not gonna let me in?

91
00:05:16,528 --> 00:05:18,567
I don't want you to talk to him
in this mood.

92
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:21,447
- What mood? I'm not in any mood.
- You're angry, again.

93
00:05:21,448 --> 00:05:23,447
No. No, I'm not.
But if I was, it would be because

94
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:26,247
a woman I hardly know is stopping me
from seeing my own father. No.

95
00:05:26,248 --> 00:05:28,567
I mean, I'm sure you'd prefer
if I never saw him again,

96
00:05:28,568 --> 00:05:29,967
- SO you can...
- So I can what?

97
00:05:29,968 --> 00:05:33,288
Oh, seriously, just let me in,
you absolute... Go home, Cass.

98
00:05:34,688 --> 00:05:37,887
Jen is simply trying to protect me
because she knows

99
00:05:37,888 --> 00:05:40,888
that I really do find all of this
incredibly upsetting.

100
00:05:44,408 --> 00:05:45,808
I mean, Jesus, Cass...

101
00:05:47,288 --> 00:05:49,567
...don't you think it's hard enough
me losing me,

102
00:05:49,568 --> 00:05:52,967
without feeling that I am losing
my daughter as well?

103
00:05:52,968 --> 00:05:54,927
I mean, really,
what's happened to you?

104
00:05:54,928 --> 00:05:57,127
- Nothing's happened to me.
- Why not try asking John

105
00:05:57,128 --> 00:06:01,607
if he thinks that's true. Or Adam.
Or your work colleagues.

106
00:06:01,608 --> 00:06:04,127
Maybe ask them if they think
you've turned into an arsehole.

107
00:06:04,128 --> 00:06:06,047
Because I do.

108
00:06:06,048 --> 00:06:07,448
Maybe I'll ask my lawyer!

109
00:06:10,008 --> 00:06:11,048
Oh.

110
00:06:13,848 --> 00:06:17,007
<i>Actually, I don't even think
you are angry about the will...</i>

111
00:06:17,008 --> 00:06:19,327
...or Jen.

112
00:06:19,328 --> 00:06:22,128
<i>I think you're angry
because you're losing him.</i>

113
00:06:23,568 --> 00:06:25,527
<i>And if that anger's helping you,</i>

114
00:06:25,528 --> 00:06:28,807
<i>fine, whatever gets you through
the night.</i>

115
00:06:28,808 --> 00:06:30,288
Except I don't think it is.

116
00:06:31,848 --> 00:06:34,287
I think it's making things worse.

117
00:06:34,288 --> 00:06:36,448
<i>And it's definitely not
helping him.</i>

118
00:06:38,768 --> 00:06:42,328
And I'll say this once more,
then you can tell me to piss off...

119
00:06:43,888 --> 00:06:47,127
<i>We don't need your pension money,
Cass, we could buy a lovely place</i>

120
00:06:47,128 --> 00:06:49,906
<i>down here, mortgage free,
with what we have.</i>

121
00:06:49,908 --> 00:06:50,712
OK.

122
00:06:50,713 --> 00:06:52,807
<i>You could leave
tomorrow if you wanted.</i>

123
00:06:52,808 --> 00:06:57,087
Of course, you're right, I know
you are... about it all and...

124
00:06:57,088 --> 00:06:58,928
<i>TW call my dad in the morning.</i>

125
00:07:01,768 --> 00:07:03,928
But the job...

126
00:07:05,288 --> 00:07:07,568
...I have to stay now, John.

127
00:07:09,128 --> 00:07:11,447
<i>There's stuff I'll tell you
one day, but...</i>

128
00:07:11,448 --> 00:07:13,608
I have to see this case through now.

129
00:07:16,848 --> 00:07:21,687
Oh, how could you forget Ram?
So handsome, we all fancied Ram.

130
00:07:21,688 --> 00:07:24,007
So you remember this incident,
Monty?

131
00:07:24,008 --> 00:07:25,927
It was me that called the police.

132
00:07:25,928 --> 00:07:28,327
Walsh made such a mess of his face.

133
00:07:28,328 --> 00:07:30,647
What about the girl,
the one the fight was about,

134
00:07:30,648 --> 00:07:32,407
do you remember her name?

135
00:07:32,408 --> 00:07:34,207
I don't remember her name, but...

136
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:35,847
she was the one
I had to keep barring

137
00:07:35,848 --> 00:07:38,207
because she was drinking too much.

138
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,967
OK, right,
but she was also a probie?

139
00:07:40,968 --> 00:07:43,847
- Yeah.
- And she was there with just Ram?

140
00:07:43,848 --> 00:07:46,487
Oh, no, she was there with
another girl, er...

141
00:07:46,488 --> 00:07:50,727
Busy Lizzie...
always moving at 100 miles an hour.

142
00:07:50,728 --> 00:07:54,007
Now, the arresting officer suggested
that the suspect

143
00:07:54,008 --> 00:07:55,607
had made a pass at the girl?

144
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:58,607
Oh, it was much more than a pass,
I think.

145
00:07:58,608 --> 00:08:03,487
There was an alley to the ladies
outside, and he grabbed her there.

146
00:08:03,488 --> 00:08:06,127
These days, you call it
a sexual assault.

147
00:08:06,128 --> 00:08:10,527
Ram had interrupted it...
and just went for him.

148
00:08:10,528 --> 00:08:13,088
He bit off more than he could chew,
unfortunately.

149
00:08:15,768 --> 00:08:19,207
Hey, Dad, it's me. Er... listen,

150
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:21,408
I don't wanna do this
on a message...

151
00:08:22,528 --> 00:08:25,408
<i>...but can you call me, please?
I really wanna speak to you.</i>

152
00:08:33,288 --> 00:08:34,608
SCRAPING

153
00:08:45,328 --> 00:08:47,527
What year was your conviction?

154
00:08:47,528 --> 00:08:49,128
The dangerous driving thing.

155
00:08:51,728 --> 00:08:54,088
1993.

156
00:08:55,248 --> 00:08:57,768
And what year did you become
a therapist?

157
00:09:01,368 --> 00:09:03,927
2004.

158
00:09:03,928 --> 00:09:06,127
And they didn't have a problem
with that?

159
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:07,727
Your regulatory body.

160
00:09:07,728 --> 00:09:10,008
They didn't have a problem
giving you a licence?

161
00:09:16,728 --> 00:09:18,888
Well, they would've done, yeah.

162
00:09:20,368 --> 00:09:22,847
What do you mean,
"they would've done"?

163
00:09:22,848 --> 00:09:26,687
- I don't have a licence.
- Yeah, you've got a licence.

164
00:09:26,688 --> 00:09:29,247
It's on your letterhead, Fi.
I mean, how else would you practise

165
00:09:29,248 --> 00:09:31,647
if you didn't have a bloody licence?

166
00:09:31,648 --> 00:09:33,408
It's a fake one.

167
00:09:34,728 --> 00:09:36,808
I bought it online
for a hundred quid.

168
00:09:38,928 --> 00:09:45,207
My degree is real, my PhD is real,
my psychotherapy training is real.

169
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:49,088
I just... never applied
for an actual licence because...

170
00:09:50,728 --> 00:09:52,128
...I didn't think I'd get one.

171
00:09:54,048 --> 00:09:57,087
So you've been practising
fraudulently for 16 years?

172
00:09:57,088 --> 00:09:59,047
Yeah.

173
00:09:59,048 --> 00:10:01,647
- How have you never been...
- I always expected to be found out,

174
00:10:01,648 --> 00:10:03,488
but it just...

175
00:10:05,608 --> 00:10:08,008
...never happened.

176
00:10:09,088 --> 00:10:11,807
- Does Mark know about this?
- No.

177
00:10:11,808 --> 00:10:15,007
We have a commercial loan,
which we've agreed to pay back

178
00:10:15,008 --> 00:10:17,287
with the income from a job

179
00:10:17,288 --> 00:10:19,728
you're not legally qualified
to practise?

180
00:10:49,246 --> 00:10:51,045
Excuse me.

181
00:10:51,046 --> 00:10:55,845
So, the phone mast data gives us
Ram Sidhu and Dean Barton

182
00:10:55,846 --> 00:10:58,605
within a mile of each another,
40 miles outside London,

183
00:10:58,606 --> 00:11:01,765
three days after we announced
the discovery of Walsh's body.

184
00:11:01,766 --> 00:11:04,645
- Where?
- At a... wood just outside Guildford.

185
00:11:04,646 --> 00:11:05,965
- That's really good.
- Mm.

186
00:11:05,966 --> 00:11:09,605
And then, one of the boards down
by the allotment has given us a guy

187
00:11:09,606 --> 00:11:11,805
who thinks he may have seen
something that night,

188
00:11:11,806 --> 00:11:14,005
so we're bringing him in.
Right.

189
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:17,526
And Monty... came up trumps.

190
00:11:20,646 --> 00:11:23,165
It's actually more
than you asked for.

191
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:25,086
I don't want more.

192
00:11:26,206 --> 00:11:28,765
Well, think of it as
a backdated pay rise.

193
00:11:28,766 --> 00:11:31,565
I should have listened to you
sooner and...

194
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:34,325
I am truly sorry about that.

195
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:35,926
BANGING

196
00:11:40,206 --> 00:11:42,565
I would never have actually
said anything

197
00:11:42,566 --> 00:11:44,526
because I know she'd just...

198
00:11:47,086 --> 00:11:49,285
I don't think you're a bad person,
Liz,

199
00:11:49,286 --> 00:11:51,406
and I shouldn't have said
what I did.

200
00:11:57,406 --> 00:11:59,406
You deserved better.

201
00:12:06,045 --> 00:12:07,925
So, this has never felt like
a mob attack to me.

202
00:12:07,926 --> 00:12:09,845
- Nor to me.
- No wounds on his body,

203
00:12:09,846 --> 00:12:12,206
- kick marks, punch marks.
- We also know that three of them

204
00:12:12,207 --> 00:12:15,085
got out of the car separately, with
only the women getting out together.

205
00:12:15,086 --> 00:12:17,725
- Yeah, and they're five coppers.
- Indeed.

206
00:12:17,726 --> 00:12:19,485
So to me, if this wasn't
an accident,

207
00:12:19,486 --> 00:12:21,765
if it was deliberate...

208
00:12:21,766 --> 00:12:24,246
it feels like it was more likely
to have been just one of them,

209
00:12:24,247 --> 00:12:25,925
and then the others
came across the scene.

210
00:12:25,926 --> 00:12:28,365
Yeah, and then for whatever reason,
and this needs work,

211
00:12:28,366 --> 00:12:30,845
cos I struggle to understand
why the fuck anyone would,

212
00:12:30,846 --> 00:12:34,046
- but they agreed to cover it up.
- Mm. But which one?

213
00:12:35,446 --> 00:12:38,365
So Ram Sidhu has to be
the most obvious candidate.

214
00:12:38,366 --> 00:12:40,645
Yeah.

215
00:12:40,646 --> 00:12:43,445
He's got the most obvious grievance,
he's a loose cannon.

216
00:12:43,446 --> 00:12:45,605
He got out of the car first.

217
00:12:45,606 --> 00:12:47,725
But let's game the others.

218
00:12:47,726 --> 00:12:51,445
So, Fiona, we now know,
was sexually assaulted by this man.

219
00:12:51,446 --> 00:12:54,405
Yeah, but... would a woman
stab a man in the head?

220
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:57,726
If he made easy sexist assumptions,
very possibly.

221
00:12:58,926 --> 00:13:01,525
Actually, we don't know
what a sexual assault

222
00:13:01,526 --> 00:13:03,765
might have triggered in her,
from her own past, I mean.

223
00:13:03,766 --> 00:13:05,486
No, it's a good thought.

224
00:13:06,966 --> 00:13:10,765
- What about Baildon?
- So the woman she maybe loved

225
00:13:10,766 --> 00:13:13,205
had been sexually assaulted
by Walsh.

226
00:13:13,206 --> 00:13:15,406
Would a woman stab a man
in the head, though?

227
00:13:16,686 --> 00:13:18,285
And then...

228
00:13:18,286 --> 00:13:20,606
- there's Barton and Fogerty.
- Yeah, and...

229
00:13:22,646 --> 00:13:27,885
...we have zero on Fogerty,
which we really need to address.

230
00:13:27,886 --> 00:13:30,885
And then we have Barton
with his criminal family history.

231
00:13:30,886 --> 00:13:34,045
- With associated violence.
- No connection to Walsh.

232
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:36,446
No evidence that he was even
in the pub. No.

233
00:13:37,726 --> 00:13:40,885
- We can call Sidhu back in?
- Except he'll just deny it.

234
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:43,405
Not a chance we'll get a confession
out of him.

235
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:46,526
And we don't have enough evidence
to charge him, so, no.

236
00:13:47,646 --> 00:13:48,885
SHE SIGHS

237
00:13:48,886 --> 00:13:50,726
So I think the best bet
is to divide and rule.

238
00:13:52,766 --> 00:13:55,525
Scare the shit out of all them
with what we do know.

239
00:13:55,526 --> 00:13:57,605
Hmm...

240
00:13:57,606 --> 00:14:00,525
Maybe offer them the promise
of cooperation deals.

241
00:14:00,526 --> 00:14:03,885
Make them all, individually,
think we have more than we have,

242
00:14:03,886 --> 00:14:06,286
so that they then turn against
each other. I like it.

243
00:14:08,046 --> 00:14:10,445
We already have...

244
00:14:10,446 --> 00:14:15,325
Yeah, we've got nice stuff
on Baildon and Grayson, er...

245
00:14:15,326 --> 00:14:18,005
But let's get more.
I'd love to nail Baildon

246
00:14:18,006 --> 00:14:19,885
with that blood test stuff.

247
00:14:19,886 --> 00:14:22,765
And then we need more on Sidhu
and Barton.

248
00:14:22,766 --> 00:14:24,846
I mean, stuff like
the phone masts...

249
00:14:26,246 --> 00:14:29,165
...that suggests collusion,
that proves they're lying to us,

250
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:30,566
and it allows us to ask why.

251
00:14:31,686 --> 00:14:35,445
So let's get authority to view
Sidhu's disciplinary record

252
00:14:35,446 --> 00:14:37,045
and go through it
with a fine tooth comb

253
00:14:37,046 --> 00:14:40,525
to see if he has a capacity
for violence. Similarly with Barton.

254
00:14:40,526 --> 00:14:42,805
He's a lad from a...

255
00:14:42,806 --> 00:14:45,765
family of career criminals
who decides to join the police,

256
00:14:45,766 --> 00:14:49,805
what's the story there?
Let's try to speak to his family.

257
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:52,205
I also think we should go after
bank accounts as well.

258
00:14:52,206 --> 00:14:55,365
Fiona may not be the only one asking
favours from old academy friends.

259
00:14:55,366 --> 00:14:57,925
Mm. And let's dig more on Fogerty.

260
00:14:57,926 --> 00:15:00,485
Because unless there's something
fabulously incriminating

261
00:15:00,486 --> 00:15:02,125
about the murder weapon,
if I was them,

262
00:15:02,126 --> 00:15:04,925
and I was forced by weight
of evidence to finally admit

263
00:15:04,926 --> 00:15:06,846
that, yes, I was there that night...

264
00:15:08,886 --> 00:15:11,246
.who am I then gonna blame
for the actual murder?

265
00:15:12,686 --> 00:15:14,725
The dead guy with the body
in his house.

266
00:15:14,726 --> 00:15:17,645
The dead guy with the body
in his house.

267
00:15:17,646 --> 00:15:19,046
Yeah.

268
00:15:26,446 --> 00:15:28,485
That's my birthday, that date.

269
00:15:28,486 --> 00:15:31,765
And that year was my 40th,
so I remember that night well.

270
00:15:31,766 --> 00:15:35,165
I'd had a few with my wife
to celebrate,

271
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:37,165
and then I took the dog out.

272
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:40,605
And it was next to the allotments
that I saw them.

273
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:44,205
This was by the entrance,
before they stuck the gates up.

274
00:15:44,206 --> 00:15:45,925
How many of them, do you remember?

275
00:15:45,926 --> 00:15:50,565
Well, two... carrying it,
whatever it was,

276
00:15:50,566 --> 00:15:53,045
wrapped up in tarp.

277
00:15:53,046 --> 00:15:55,406
Maybe one opening the boot.

278
00:15:57,326 --> 00:16:01,445
Couldn't swear to that, though.
But then definitely two arguing.

279
00:16:01,446 --> 00:16:03,285
Arguing?

280
00:16:03,286 --> 00:16:06,765
- A woman and a man, she was crying.
- Right.

281
00:16:06,766 --> 00:16:09,806
- Did you hear anything they said?
- No.

282
00:16:11,006 --> 00:16:12,726
Oh. Did you say anything?

283
00:16:14,286 --> 00:16:17,126
I said, "What you got there,
a dead body?"

284
00:16:29,566 --> 00:16:31,486
Oh, there you are.

285
00:16:42,726 --> 00:16:44,246
How long have you known?

286
00:16:46,126 --> 00:16:47,526
Known what?

287
00:16:49,566 --> 00:16:51,206
What I told Dad.

288
00:16:57,966 --> 00:17:00,965
He mentioned it just before he died.

289
00:17:00,966 --> 00:17:04,285
I mean, he was babbling all sorts
of nonsense at that point,

290
00:17:04,286 --> 00:17:07,406
so I didn't take it
remotely seriously.

291
00:17:09,966 --> 00:17:11,885
Clearly I was wrong.

292
00:17:11,886 --> 00:17:13,205
SHE SNIFFS

293
00:17:13,206 --> 00:17:16,485
I have to say, Elizabeth,
my estimation of you

294
00:17:16,486 --> 00:17:19,125
has gone up enormously.

295
00:17:19,126 --> 00:17:22,406
You're in danger
of almost being interesting.

296
00:17:27,326 --> 00:17:29,286
I am who I am, Mum.

297
00:17:30,446 --> 00:17:34,406
I've always been...
pretty happy with that.

298
00:17:36,886 --> 00:17:38,486
I've made mistakes.

299
00:17:40,126 --> 00:17:43,965
One dreadful one. My God,
I'd have loathed to have lived

300
00:17:43,966 --> 00:17:49,005
a life like yours.
To have been a person who's...

301
00:17:49,006 --> 00:17:52,365
never even contemplated
helping others,

302
00:17:52,366 --> 00:17:57,285
who's never even considered trying
to make the world a better place.

303
00:17:57,286 --> 00:17:59,605
You're beginning to sound like
a Michael Jackson song...

304
00:17:59,606 --> 00:18:01,606
Shut the fuck up!

305
00:18:10,246 --> 00:18:12,646
I don't expect love from you.

306
00:18:13,766 --> 00:18:16,845
You've only ever loved yourself.

307
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:19,965
But you will speak to me
with respect from now on.

308
00:18:19,966 --> 00:18:21,886
Or... I swear...

309
00:18:23,046 --> 00:18:26,845
...I swear... I will come in here
while you're sleeping

310
00:18:26,846 --> 00:18:31,485
and I will stick a pillow over
your smug, self-satisfied face,

311
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:33,406
until you are quiet.

312
00:19:04,246 --> 00:19:05,326
Mrs Quinn?

313
00:19:06,566 --> 00:19:09,885
Liam and Sean don't live 'ere,
haven't done for years.

314
00:19:09,886 --> 00:19:12,206
It was actually Dean we came about.

315
00:19:13,526 --> 00:19:17,646
What could I tell you about Dean?
I ain't seen him for 30 years.

316
00:19:25,886 --> 00:19:28,965
My husband's dead now...

317
00:19:28,966 --> 00:19:32,245
but in his world,
the notion of crossing that line,

318
00:19:32,246 --> 00:19:35,925
becoming a copper,
that was as bad as it got.

319
00:19:35,926 --> 00:19:37,406
So when he found out...

320
00:19:38,806 --> 00:19:41,285
...it was awful.

321
00:19:41,286 --> 00:19:43,805
Worse even than Dean expected,
I think.

322
00:19:43,806 --> 00:19:46,965
That night, he went down the local,

323
00:19:46,966 --> 00:19:49,205
where they'd known him
since he was a kid,

324
00:19:49,206 --> 00:19:51,206
and they wouldn't let him in.

325
00:19:52,726 --> 00:19:56,965
As he walked away, he was attacked
and beaten to pulp,

326
00:19:56,966 --> 00:20:00,605
by two of his brothers,
while his father watched.

327
00:20:00,606 --> 00:20:02,366
FRONT DOOR OPENS
Mum?

328
00:20:05,806 --> 00:20:07,245
Out, now.

329
00:20:07,246 --> 00:20:09,645
They're going, Sean.
Just wait outside.

330
00:20:09,646 --> 00:20:12,006
You shouldn't be fucking talking
to them in the first place.

331
00:20:12,007 --> 00:20:13,407
Out-side.

332
00:20:18,606 --> 00:20:20,446
I'll give you one minute.

333
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:26,085
DOOR OPENS, THEN CLOSES

334
00:20:26,086 --> 00:20:27,365
Has he been happy?

335
00:20:27,366 --> 00:20:29,526
I think so, yeah.

336
00:20:30,526 --> 00:20:31,965
Still old bill?

337
00:20:31,966 --> 00:20:34,926
He left straight after training.

338
00:20:36,966 --> 00:20:38,206
Married?

339
00:20:39,286 --> 00:20:42,606
Yeah. With two children.

340
00:20:44,886 --> 00:20:47,685
Can you tell me where he lives?

341
00:20:47,686 --> 00:20:49,845
I don't think we can do that,
I'm afraid.

342
00:20:49,846 --> 00:20:51,326
Please.

343
00:20:53,766 --> 00:20:56,126
I ain't got long.

344
00:21:04,526 --> 00:21:07,605
Not a lot to say, Marn,
there are no great secrets.

345
00:21:07,606 --> 00:21:09,806
Calais was a one-off.

346
00:21:11,766 --> 00:21:14,886
It's a debt repaid.
It'll never happen again, I promise.

347
00:21:16,006 --> 00:21:17,886
And my family...

348
00:21:19,046 --> 00:21:21,245
...don't actually know
if my mum's alive.

349
00:21:21,246 --> 00:21:23,166
Or my dad. Or my brothers.

350
00:21:25,086 --> 00:21:27,845
But they're not the kind of people
I'd want to bring into your life,

351
00:21:27,846 --> 00:21:29,286
or the kids'.

352
00:21:31,646 --> 00:21:34,246
Now, I cannot tell you how much I...

353
00:21:35,457 --> 00:21:37,714
...hated them and the...

354
00:21:39,246 --> 00:21:42,005
...the values that they held,
that they tried to instil in me.

355
00:21:42,006 --> 00:21:43,406
The person that...

356
00:21:44,766 --> 00:21:47,806
...they very nearly made me become,
in fact.

357
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:53,846
So it's been a long, hard
30 years...

358
00:22:03,526 --> 00:22:07,246
CHOKING UP: ..trying to distance
myself from them. And I...

359
00:22:10,966 --> 00:22:13,485
CRYING: Please, don't...

360
00:22:13,486 --> 00:22:15,086
don't make me go back there.

361
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:18,326
HE CRIES
I'm sorry.

362
00:22:23,486 --> 00:22:26,605
So, Ram Sidhu has twice been accused
of using excessive force.

363
00:22:26,606 --> 00:22:29,645
First time was 16 years ago
during a row in a shopping centre

364
00:22:29,646 --> 00:22:32,925
with a member of the public,
who he alleged racially abused him.

365
00:22:32,926 --> 00:22:35,125
And then the second time
was six years ago

366
00:22:35,126 --> 00:22:37,045
with a fellow officer,
who he claims

367
00:22:37,046 --> 00:22:38,885
used a racial slur against him.

368
00:22:38,886 --> 00:22:41,485
On both occasions, he was cleared,
but on both occasions,

369
00:22:41,486 --> 00:22:44,525
witnesses describe the violence
as "coming out of nowhere".

370
00:22:44,526 --> 00:22:48,165
And one described him as going
from 0 to 60 in under a second.

371
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:49,925
Fran, Rob Fogerty?

372
00:22:49,926 --> 00:22:52,565
Er, yeah. Erm... rather sad man.

373
00:22:52,566 --> 00:22:54,365
Worked a variety
of fairly dead-end jobs

374
00:22:54,366 --> 00:22:57,565
after leaving the force.
Did these until about ten years ago

375
00:22:57,566 --> 00:23:00,725
when his drinking stopped him
from being able to hold down a job.

376
00:23:00,726 --> 00:23:04,405
He then lived on benefits
and inherited money from his dad.

377
00:23:04,406 --> 00:23:07,565
I managed to track down a teacher
at his old secondary school,

378
00:23:07,566 --> 00:23:09,645
who described him as
a very sweet boy,

379
00:23:09,646 --> 00:23:11,645
but one who struggled academically

380
00:23:11,646 --> 00:23:14,005
and one who was also
very easily led.

381
00:23:14,006 --> 00:23:17,165
- And Jake.
- So, I can't conclusively prove

382
00:23:17,166 --> 00:23:19,165
that Baildon deliberately
lost the bloods,

383
00:23:19,166 --> 00:23:21,365
but I can prove
that she was on custody duty

384
00:23:21,366 --> 00:23:23,565
the night the vials went missing
from the fridge.

385
00:23:23,566 --> 00:23:26,285
I can also prove that she
volunteered for overtime that night.

386
00:23:26,286 --> 00:23:31,085
So I think we have enough on Grayson
and Baildon right now.

387
00:23:31,086 --> 00:23:33,605
Let's give 'em a tug
and put them under some pressure.

388
00:23:33,606 --> 00:23:37,125
And, Fran,
so the fourth Quinn brother is dead,

389
00:23:37,126 --> 00:23:38,565
I'd like to know how and when.

390
00:23:38,566 --> 00:23:41,406
It might be nothing, but have a dig.
Thank you, guys.

391
00:23:48,566 --> 00:23:51,406
Need you downstairs, please, kids.
House talk.

392
00:23:54,726 --> 00:23:56,606
House talk, please.

393
00:24:01,166 --> 00:24:03,166
What's going on, Dad?

394
00:24:09,606 --> 00:24:11,965
So, the question is...

395
00:24:11,966 --> 00:24:15,485
looking ahead to year end '21,
what impact will that overspend

396
00:24:15,486 --> 00:24:16,845
have on rural services?

397
00:24:16,846 --> 00:24:19,166
If you could turn to page 14...

398
00:24:26,246 --> 00:24:28,965
One more thing...

399
00:24:28,966 --> 00:24:30,486
Sir...

400
00:24:31,766 --> 00:24:34,845
...I'm afraid I need to withdraw
my candidacy.

401
00:24:34,846 --> 00:24:37,966
- What, sorry, wh...?
- I just want to say...

402
00:24:39,206 --> 00:24:41,885
...I am deeply sorry if I've
caused you any embarrassment.

403
00:24:41,886 --> 00:24:45,045
Liz, I'm sorry,
I've got absolutely no idea...

404
00:24:45,046 --> 00:24:46,445
KNOCK ON DOOR

405
00:24:46,446 --> 00:24:49,805
So sorry to interrupt, sir,
but there are two officers here

406
00:24:49,806 --> 00:24:53,726
who need to speak to DCC Baildon.
They've said it's fairly urgent.

407
00:24:58,373 --> 00:25:01,412
So your dad and I have been talking,
and I need to tell you some things

408
00:25:01,413 --> 00:25:04,933
about myself and my past.

409
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,320
OK. First up, erm...

410
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,719
...my dad didn't die
when I was a baby.

411
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,239
I wasn't brought up
by foster parents.

412
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,440
He died when I was 20.

413
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,519
And one of the reasons
I lied about this

414
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:26,479
was because on his gravestone,
it says "A copper's copper”,

415
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,919
and I didn't want anyone to know
that he was a copper,

416
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:33,079
as was his dad before him.
And here's the thing,

417
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:36,839
for a brief period of time,
as was I.

418
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:40,439
And I tell you this
because it starts to explain

419
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:43,839
a part of my life about
which I am deeply ashamed,

420
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,399
- and which I also lied about...
- KNOCK ON DOOR

421
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,400
- Shall I get the door, Dad?
- No, no, no, leave the door.

422
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:56,319
So, kids, I did not want
to be a policewoman.

423
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,119
It had always seemed a limiting
and backward world to me,

424
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,319
but to say that to my dad
felt like it would...

425
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:05,559
ridicule the path he and my grandad
had followed, so I lied.

426
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:10,319
I lied to myself, and I lied to him,
which was a stupid thing to do.

427
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,239
KNOCK ON DOOR
This is funny, erm...

428
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,839
He actually died
18 months after I qualified,

429
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,479
and I found out from his diaries

430
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,879
that he hadn't wanted
to be a police officer, either.

431
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,679
- He'd done it to please his dad.
- KNOCK ON DOOR

432
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,319
So there's an irony there,
isn't there?

433
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,280
- Fiona, can you stop, please?
- So in order to...

434
00:26:25,281 --> 00:26:28,199
bury the unhappiness
at where I found myself,

435
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:32,599
I started drinking, a lot,
and was in fact an alcoholic

436
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,599
for many, many years, kids.

437
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:38,039
I also became very depressed,

438
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,239
and on two occasions,
I tried to kill myself.

439
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:44,199
I also, during this time,
I made many, many mistakes,

440
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:47,159
one of which I told your father
about the other night,

441
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,639
and which I need to tell you
about, too. So...

442
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,799
in 1993, I killed a child
in a car crash,

443
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,999
which is just dreadful,
but worse than that, I...

444
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,439
- Fiona Grayson.
- Yes?

445
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,879
I need you to come with us, please,
Fiona. I'm talking to my kids.

446
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,320
I can see that, but I don't think
you want me to do this here.

447
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:08,119
You've come about the body,
haven't you?

448
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,600
HE GASPS

449
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,439
Three weeks prior to the night
he disappeared,

450
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:23,359
Matthew Walsh sexually assaulted
Fiona Grayson

451
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,319
at the Ifield pub in Hendon.

452
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,399
Ram Sidhu then got into a fight
with him

453
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,079
and we believe you were there.

454
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,279
Well, what evidence do you have
for that?

455
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,799
Well, let's maybe come back to that
later. For now,

456
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,400
I'd like to stick with the events
of the night he disappeared.

457
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,639
Because I think you did
get out of the car,

458
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:44,879
following Ram spotting Walsh,
and then him deciding

459
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,359
that maybe "a bit of a chat"
was in order.

460
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,559
- Nope.
- I think a few minutes later,

461
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,079
you found yourself
on Marshfield Lane,

462
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,279
- by the allotments.
- No.

463
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,279
Where I think Matthew Walsh died.

464
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:58,039
Again, what evidence do you have
for that?

465
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:03,599
Actually, we've just found a witness
who saw a number of people

466
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,719
loading something into a car
down by the allotments

467
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,599
at about the right time.

468
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,119
Again, that sort of testimony
is not going to be taken

469
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,800
very seriously, I'm afraid.

470
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,960
<i>I would have expected better of you
than this, DC Stuart.</i>

471
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:25,799
Fiona Grayson.

472
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,959
When was the last time you saw her?

473
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:31,000
Fiona? Erm...

474
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,519
.when we left Hendon, I guess.

475
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:39,159
Right. What about when
you lived together in Thames Ditton,

476
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,440
when you were stationed
at Kingston nick?

477
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:48,200
- I'm sorry, I meant since then.
- So you just lied to me.

478
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,520
I'm actually finding this
quite stressful...

479
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:57,200
...and I'm not thinking... very...

480
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:03,919
To be clear, I haven't seen her
since we shared a flat

481
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:06,840
26 or 27 years ago.

482
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,759
So, were you in a relationship
with her?

483
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:13,159
On/off, yes.

484
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:16,799
But you never mentioned any of this
when we first met.

485
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,079
On that occasion, too...

486
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:23,079
you said that you'd not seen
any of them, bar Ram Sidhu,

487
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:25,360
- since you left Hendon.
- Apologies, that was an error.

488
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:31,520
Would have expected better of you,
Deputy Chief Constable Baildon.

489
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:38,599
So I want, if I may,
to ask you about an incident

490
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:43,479
on the 17th July 1993.

491
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:46,360
Does that date ring any bells
for you?

492
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,360
Nope.

493
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:55,839
It was the day your girlfriend
was involved in an RTC

494
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,039
in which a young child died.

495
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,640
I presume you remember that?

496
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:06,079
Actually, we'd been separated
for a year or so before that.

497
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,799
Oh, OK.

498
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,439
Well, I'm glad you've told me that,

499
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,999
because that really does
make me wonder why you did it.

500
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,079
- Did what? - Deliberately lost
the blood samples taken from her.

501
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,479
I don't know what
you're talking about.

502
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,279
The blood samples
that would've confirmed

503
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:23,679
what the arresting officer suspected
- that she was over the limit.

504
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,639
Sorry, didn't happen.

505
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,799
SHE SIGHS IN EXASPERATION

506
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:31,680
OK, let me tell you where I'm going
with this, Deputy Chief Constable.

507
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:43,359
There's lots... that we don't know
about what happened that night.

508
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,799
We don't know yet if Walsh's death
was an accident,

509
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:50,039
or a more deliberate act.
And if it was deliberate,

510
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:53,960
if it was committed
by just one of you, or more.

511
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,479
But one thing...
we are completely sure about

512
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,039
is that Matthew Walsh died
that night,

513
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:07,479
as a result of some sort
of engagement with the five people

514
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:10,839
in that car.
And that you then ALL...

515
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:13,920
colluded to hide that fact.

516
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,600
And indeed his body.

517
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,880
So, the real question now...

518
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:26,239
...is who's gonna be the first
to admit that and gain advantage

519
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,720
from their cooperation
when they're sentenced?

520
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,040
So, bearing that in mind...

521
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:41,160
...is there anything you would like
to tell us, DCC Baildon?

522
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,200
No comment.

523
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,000
RASPY BREATHING

524
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,679
<i>So, our object, it's not a rod
or a spike from the wall,</i>

525
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:08,839
<i>it's actually what I suspected
it was when I first cleaned it up.</i>

526
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:11,279
<i>- It's a pen.</i>
- A what?

527
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,559
A fountain pen, gold-tipped nib.

528
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,680
Quite a lethal weapon
if you wanted it to be.

529
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:19,839
OK, I need to see this.
I've got one more interview to do,

530
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,359
and then I'll come straight over.

531
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:24,079
But this means
he definitely was stabbed, yes?

532
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:28,119
I guess it could have been inserted
postmortem, but why?

533
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,640
CELL DOOR OPENS
I'll call you back.

534
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,280
OK, so, first up, Fiona,
how about I tell you what we know?

535
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,440
So, we know about the pub.

536
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,439
We know that Matthew Walsh
sexually assaulted you.

537
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:46,079
And we know that Ram Sidhu
then got into a fight with Matthew

538
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:50,319
because of that. And we know
Liz Baildon was there, too.

539
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:54,319
We also know about your RTC...
three years later.

540
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,119
And we suspect that Liz
then contrived

541
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,199
to lose your blood samples.

542
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,759
Given that you two weren't
in a relationship at that point,

543
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:06,599
we then have to ask...
why she'd do such a thing.

544
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,679
And we have to conclude...

545
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:12,440
that you used the events
of March 30th 1990 as leverage.

546
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:19,239
So that's what we know.

547
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:22,239
I don't think any of this
is a surprise to you.

548
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:25,640
But I'm guessing that what I'm
going to tell you next might be.

549
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,240
Matthew Walsh, we now suspect...

550
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:34,040
- ...died of a stab wound...
- No.

551
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,320
- ...to the head.
- No.

552
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,080
Unless you know different?

553
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:45,840
He was never stabbed, I promise.
It was an accident.

554
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,079
He told us it was an accident.

555
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,920
- Who?
- Ram.

556
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,680
He said that Walsh had tripped
and hit his head.

557
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,200
He said it was an accident.

558
00:34:02,732 --> 00:34:04,451
Ooh, and he scores!

559
00:34:04,452 --> 00:34:08,691
England are through
to the World Cup final!

560
00:34:08,692 --> 00:34:10,412
HE LAUGHS

561
00:34:11,727 --> 00:34:14,567
There's a woman at the door.
She says she's your mum.

562
00:34:23,407 --> 00:34:24,966
And we were driving through

563
00:34:24,967 --> 00:34:28,366
some shitty suburb,
south of Hendon...

564
00:34:28,367 --> 00:34:30,807
when Ram saw him.

565
00:34:32,407 --> 00:34:36,366
Just standing there on a patch of
grass on the other side of the road.

566
00:34:36,367 --> 00:34:39,766
And he yelled at Rob to pull over,
and it was him.

567
00:34:39,767 --> 00:34:41,847
The lad who'd put his hand
up my skirt...

568
00:34:43,487 --> 00:34:46,286
...who'd given Ram a pasting.

569
00:34:46,287 --> 00:34:47,967
No doubt, it was him.

570
00:34:49,007 --> 00:34:53,046
And Ram said we should search him

571
00:34:53,047 --> 00:34:54,886
because he was bound to have gear
on him.

572
00:34:54,887 --> 00:34:58,246
And just have a bit of fun with him,
give him a bit of a scare.

573
00:34:58,247 --> 00:35:02,366
And me and Liz kept saying no,
telling Ram he was drunk

574
00:35:02,367 --> 00:35:03,727
and behaving like an idiot.

575
00:35:05,447 --> 00:35:08,806
And then... Ram looked at Rob,

576
00:35:08,807 --> 00:35:11,606
and they both grin...

577
00:35:11,607 --> 00:35:15,526
and then suddenly, he gets out
the car, before we can stop him,

578
00:35:15,527 --> 00:35:19,246
and shouting over at Walsh,
who sees who it is,

579
00:35:19,247 --> 00:35:21,126
and then just pegs it.

580
00:35:21,127 --> 00:35:23,806
And Rob's pissing himself laughing,

581
00:35:23,807 --> 00:35:26,926
and we're saying, "Stay in
the fucking car, stay in the car."

582
00:35:26,927 --> 00:35:30,246
And then he's getting out the car
and running after them both.

583
00:35:30,247 --> 00:35:33,567
So then it's just me and Lizzie
and Dean.

584
00:35:35,047 --> 00:35:37,527
And Dean is really, really quiet.

585
00:35:38,767 --> 00:35:42,086
And then he said something like,
he'd better go and stop them

586
00:35:42,087 --> 00:35:44,566
doing anything stupid.

587
00:35:44,567 --> 00:35:46,767
And then he gets out.

588
00:35:48,487 --> 00:35:52,566
And he walks, he doesn't run.

589
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:55,326
And me and Lizzie,
we just stayed where we were,

590
00:35:55,327 --> 00:35:59,727
waiting for them to come back,
we were fairly terrified, for ages.

591
00:36:04,447 --> 00:36:06,846
And then eventually...

592
00:36:06,847 --> 00:36:09,886
Liz said that we should go
and try and find them as well.

593
00:36:09,887 --> 00:36:13,847
Er... we got out and...

594
00:36:15,647 --> 00:36:18,247
...we walked for about 15 minutes...

595
00:36:19,527 --> 00:36:22,127
...eventually splitting up
to find them.

596
00:36:24,487 --> 00:36:27,046
And then I just turned a corner...

597
00:36:27,047 --> 00:36:30,086
and there was Ram and Rob.

598
00:36:30,087 --> 00:36:35,247
They were in this, er,
allotment behind this low wall...

599
00:36:37,167 --> 00:36:40,366
...and it was dark,
so I couldn't really see

600
00:36:40,367 --> 00:36:42,207
what was happening at first...

601
00:36:44,687 --> 00:36:48,246
...but as I got closer,
I saw the lad...

602
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:53,087
was on his back...
with a wound on his head.

603
00:36:57,047 --> 00:36:58,167
And...

604
00:37:00,727 --> 00:37:04,607
...Ram was next to him,
giving him CPR.

605
00:37:06,127 --> 00:37:08,647
CRYING: Oh, God.

606
00:37:13,847 --> 00:37:16,286
And as he was doing it,
he just kept saying over and over

607
00:37:16,287 --> 00:37:18,687
that he didn't do anything,
he just found him like that.

608
00:37:22,607 --> 00:37:24,806
And then somebody said
that we should...

609
00:37:24,807 --> 00:37:26,887
knock on a door
and call for an ambulance.

610
00:37:28,167 --> 00:37:30,647
And then Ram said no...

611
00:37:33,127 --> 00:37:35,647
...because he was already gone...

612
00:37:39,487 --> 00:37:41,447
...he was already dead.

613
00:37:43,927 --> 00:37:46,206
- There you go.
- Shukriya, bachche.

614
00:37:46,207 --> 00:37:47,807
One for you.

615
00:38:01,567 --> 00:38:02,887
Just look at me, Dad.

616
00:38:08,487 --> 00:38:10,047
Just once.

617
00:38:11,287 --> 00:38:13,087
That's all I want.

618
00:38:15,607 --> 00:38:18,127
Then maybe I can stop
all this shit.

619
00:38:20,567 --> 00:38:23,047
The money, the job, the lot.

620
00:38:29,367 --> 00:38:32,367
LAUGHING: Just look at me.

621
00:38:44,247 --> 00:38:48,086
And I've gone over it 100,000 times
since and...

622
00:38:48,087 --> 00:38:52,166
y'know, there was a logic to it,
of course. He was dead...

623
00:38:52,167 --> 00:38:55,567
there was nothing anyone could do
to help, it was just an accident.

624
00:38:57,367 --> 00:38:58,847
But in here...

625
00:39:00,807 --> 00:39:02,967
...I know we should have
called for help.

626
00:39:05,007 --> 00:39:06,527
I've always known.

627
00:39:07,807 --> 00:39:10,566
And so, who then...

628
00:39:10,567 --> 00:39:12,447
suggested you take him?

629
00:39:13,967 --> 00:39:17,326
Ram. He knew they might
trace it back to him

630
00:39:17,327 --> 00:39:20,006
because of the fight in the Ifield.

631
00:39:20,007 --> 00:39:22,927
And he thought he might have left
clothing fibres...

632
00:39:24,887 --> 00:39:26,886
...on the lad's body, so...

633
00:39:26,887 --> 00:39:30,327
This thing changed my entire life.
This...

634
00:39:32,087 --> 00:39:34,167
...horrific decision
I went along with.

635
00:39:36,287 --> 00:39:40,007
It happened in a moment.
One minute, my life was normal...

636
00:39:42,327 --> 00:39:44,727
Normal. And the next...

637
00:39:46,207 --> 00:39:48,486
...it was...

638
00:39:48,487 --> 00:39:51,167
what it became,
the life I ended up living.

639
00:39:54,087 --> 00:39:56,127
So once you decided...

640
00:39:57,607 --> 00:40:00,047
- ...Rob went and got the car?
- Yeah.

641
00:40:02,047 --> 00:40:04,966
And then you all...

642
00:40:04,967 --> 00:40:07,846
- helped put him in?
- I didn't.

643
00:40:07,847 --> 00:40:10,887
I was in too much of a state.
But the others did, yeah.

644
00:40:12,647 --> 00:40:17,566
And then Rob's hands were shaking
so much that, erm, Ram gave him

645
00:40:17,567 --> 00:40:20,566
a couple of swigs from a bottle
of whiskey that he had with him.

646
00:40:20,567 --> 00:40:24,726
Which is why he was over the limit.

647
00:40:24,727 --> 00:40:27,327
And Rob was meant to get rid
of the body?

648
00:40:28,687 --> 00:40:30,967
He kind of hero worshipped Ram.

649
00:40:34,247 --> 00:40:36,887
And Ram convinced him
he was the best placed.

650
00:40:38,767 --> 00:40:41,647
And, of course, we all thought
he had got rid of it.

651
00:40:44,727 --> 00:40:47,047
I thought it was an accident.

652
00:40:48,727 --> 00:40:51,167
Otherwise, I would never
have covered it up.

653
00:40:54,087 --> 00:40:56,447
We all thought it was an accident.

654
00:40:58,327 --> 00:41:00,487
SHE CRIES

655
00:41:05,007 --> 00:41:07,806
I'm not expecting forgiveness.
I'm not expecting love,

656
00:41:07,807 --> 00:41:09,287
or a relationship.

657
00:41:11,567 --> 00:41:13,807
I ain't come here
expecting anything.

658
00:41:17,647 --> 00:41:20,366
I just want you...

659
00:41:20,367 --> 00:41:21,967
my son...

660
00:41:23,807 --> 00:41:27,167
...to know, before I die,
that I love you.

661
00:41:29,767 --> 00:41:31,727
I always have.

662
00:41:36,407 --> 00:41:38,567
And I'm sorry.

663
00:41:44,447 --> 00:41:46,367
How long do you have?

664
00:41:50,767 --> 00:41:52,286
So she's telling the truth,
her truth,

665
00:41:52,287 --> 00:41:54,606
she thought that was what happened.

666
00:41:54,607 --> 00:41:56,006
Or she knew he was stabbed

667
00:41:56,007 --> 00:41:58,326
and this is all
a carefully calculated lie

668
00:41:58,327 --> 00:42:01,446
- to minimise her culpability.
- Or she did it.

669
00:42:01,447 --> 00:42:03,526
Nah, she didn't do it.

670
00:42:03,527 --> 00:42:05,926
And she didn't know he was stabbed,
either.

671
00:42:05,927 --> 00:42:09,726
Unless she's the best liar
in the world.

672
00:42:09,727 --> 00:42:11,287
Which I don't buy.

673
00:42:13,247 --> 00:42:15,247
So, who did do it?

674
00:42:20,087 --> 00:42:23,086
OK, it's late,
I'm gonna nip over to the mortuary.

675
00:42:23,087 --> 00:42:24,766
Let's discuss further tomorrow.

676
00:42:24,767 --> 00:42:27,806
- You're gonna go now?
- Mm.

677
00:42:27,807 --> 00:42:30,607
Do you wanna charge either of them
with anything? No.

678
00:42:32,007 --> 00:42:34,246
RUI them both for now.

679
00:42:34,247 --> 00:42:36,287
Let's see where we get to tomorrow.

680
00:42:37,687 --> 00:42:39,007
Hey, boss...

681
00:42:41,967 --> 00:42:43,247
...we're getting there.

682
00:42:56,087 --> 00:42:58,447
Hey, Dad. Me again.

683
00:42:59,567 --> 00:43:02,806
Listen, maybe I'm not gonna
get to speak to you today...

684
00:43:02,807 --> 00:43:04,207
so I just wanna say...

685
00:43:06,727 --> 00:43:08,567
Ram?

686
00:43:23,567 --> 00:43:25,526
And then after I called you,

687
00:43:25,527 --> 00:43:27,926
I went online and checked
a few details of pens

688
00:43:27,927 --> 00:43:31,886
this shape and design and...
I think it is a Cigne.

689
00:43:31,887 --> 00:43:34,886
And if it is, they've got
serial numbers on the nib body,

690
00:43:34,887 --> 00:43:37,126
which might be visible
under the right light,

691
00:43:37,127 --> 00:43:41,246
and might give you the name
of the purchaser. Wow.

692
00:43:41,247 --> 00:43:43,087
That's... brilliant.

693
00:43:45,207 --> 00:43:47,686
I will sort that tomorrow.

694
00:43:47,687 --> 00:43:50,607
Go home, you look knackered.

695
00:43:51,807 --> 00:43:55,967
- You are a stone cold genius, Leanne.
- Yeah. This, er, this much is true.

696
00:43:57,007 --> 00:43:59,486
<i>TW get that picked up first thing.</i>

697
00:43:59,487 --> 00:44:01,246
Thank you again.
Night, Cass.

698
00:44:01,247 --> 00:44:02,367
Night.

699
00:45:02,247 --> 00:45:03,807
Come on, Dad.

699
00:45:04,305 --> 00:46:04,508
