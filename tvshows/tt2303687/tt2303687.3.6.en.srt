1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,960
Before Danny died, he
tried to say something.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,960
Now I reckon what he said was "list".

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,539
Got a firearm in here, no-one enter.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,960
Investigating former Chief
Superintendant Patrick Fairbank

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,060
in respect of not adequately investigating

6
00:00:15,099 --> 00:00:17,660
complaints of child sexual exploitation.

7
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:20,940
The things they did to us at Sands View...

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,440
It's OK.

9
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,940
Ma'am, I'm requesting authorisation
on an undercover operation.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,879
It would be against a
fellow AC-12 officer.

11
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,960
DI Cottan set me up.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,960
As far as the rope goes, he must
have planted it there beforehand.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,960
What happened with the postmortem?
Weren't you supposed to organise it?

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,960
He knew forensics hadn't
bothered testing the envelope.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,399
I don't want to get caught
between you and DI Cottan.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,960
The Caddy is male, under 35.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,939
A detective, a London
or South East accent.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Sorry, gaffer, but the finger
is pointing at one of our own.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,960
I have a number of concerns regarding

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,960
DS Arnott's professional conduct.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,959
He's been bearing a
firearm around the office.

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,939
I have signed the firearm back in.

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,939
I am innocent, the question is... are you?

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,960
He's been accused of having
an improper relationship

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,960
with a suspect, of planting
evidence against said suspect.

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,960
I did not plant evidence!

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,960
We agree the best course
of action is for you to be

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
suspended from duty until
these matters can be addressed.

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
SIM Card? It's all in there.

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The incriminating item I've got
on you, that's my only insurance.

31
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,939
I need to know you've
got my back. God, yeah.

32
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:44,960
He's hiding summat.

33
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,939
That lead on Steve, it looks
like it's going to pan out.

34
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,939
He really did plant that money on Lindsay.

35
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,960
There's no list here, Steve.

36
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,400
If there's not, Lindsay is
going to get what's coming.

37
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,959
'I thought it was Steve's car,
until I saw the registration.'

38
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,959
I found Danny Waldron's list.

39
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,959
It didn't make sense for
Danny to make a hard copy

40
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,960
of the original list that
could be lost or destroyed.

41
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,960
He would make an online copy.

42
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,939
The VIPs who were abusing
boys at Sands View.

43
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
100 grand and you forget about
all of this, that list included.

44
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Why don't you just take the money?!
Because I'm a police officer!

45
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,939
Do not send that message. Let's
see what they will think...

46
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,139
when I bring in The Caddy.

47
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,074

48
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,340
How long is this going to take?

49
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,960
Patrick Fairbank,

50
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,960
some new information has come to
light that we'd like to put to you.

51
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,939
PC Bindra.

52
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,939
Document 27 is a transcript
of a professional tribunal

53
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,960
which took place on the
19th of September 1998,

54
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,939
in which Oliver Stephens-Lloyd recorded

55
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,960
he had submitted a list of
names of abusers at Sands View.

56
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,939
Oh, not this list again.

57
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,599
I don't know anything about any list.

58
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Where is this new information?

59
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I think we're done.

60
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,960
Actually, if you would just
keep your seat, please.

61
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I think we are about to hear
some new evidence, thank you.

62
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
For the tape, DC Fleming
has joined the interview.

63
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,960
Kate.

64
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,960
For the tape, I am showing the
interviewee a video capture,

65
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,939
item KMF-4.

66
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,139
Who is shown in item KMF-4?

67
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,960
I refused to take part in
any video identification.

68
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,960
You did, which meant we were forced to use

69
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,960
a video capture from
your previous interview.

70
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,939
And we are legally
entitled to use this image

71
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,959
because your client was
notified that he was going to be

72
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,939
questioned regarding an offence
-- misconduct in public office.

73
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,939
In accordance with paragraph five, Code D

74
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,959
of the Police and Criminal
Evidence Act, item KMF-4,

75
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,939
alongside eight other video captures

76
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,959
of unrelated, similar persons were shown

77
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,959
by an officer independent
of this inquiry to a witness

78
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,939
who was a resident at Sands
View Boys' Home in the 1990s.

79
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,939
This witness identified KMF-4
as showing one of the men

80
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
who sexually abused him.

81
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,939
These politicians and celebrities,
they couldn't have got away with

82
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,939
this time and time again without
the collusion of police officers.

83
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,959
I mean, I kept asking
myself over and over again,

84
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,939
how could they turn a blind eye,

85
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,939
how could they allow these appalling
things to happen to these children?

86
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,939
And of course, the
answer is as plain as day.

87
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
They didn't turn a blind
eye, they were in on it!

88
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'm going to take this.

89
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,139
This is a list of abusers.

90
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,899
Corroborating the names we've
already heard from our witness.

91
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Ronan Murphy, Linus Murphy...

92
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
.. Dale Roach, Tommy Hunter...

93
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
.. and Patrick Fairbank.

94
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,939
Patrick Fairbank, I am arresting
you for aggravated indecent assault,

95
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
in that this offence occurred
before May the 1st 2004...

96
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,939
.. with a child or children...

97
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,939
under the age of 13...

98
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
.. perverting the course of justice
and misconduct in public office.

99
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,199
Sir.

100
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Well done.

101
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,879
Well done, yourself.

102
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,399
Custody arranged at Polk Avenue.

103
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,939
You think you got me?

104
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,959
You haven't got a clue. I
hope you like the outdoors

105
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,939
because you are going
to be directing traffic

106
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
to the end of your sad little career.

107
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,939
Bitch.

108
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
'This is Lindsay Denton. Please
leave a message after the tone.'

109
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Shit!

110
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,939
DS Arnott. Need to report the
theft of my service vehicle. Taxi!

111
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Yeah, 5... 5 Kings Gate Apartments. Yeah.

112
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
DS Arnott. I need the key
to Lindsay Denton's room.

113
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,600
Mother of God.

114
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,960
'This is Lindsay Denton. Please
leave a message after the tone.'

115
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,200
I know you nicked my pocketbook,
and I don't know where you are...

116
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,940
Police! Armed police!

117
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,960
I'm AC-12! Don't move! I'm AC-12!

118
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,940
You! Keep your hands above
your head. Down on your knees.

119
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,960
Just calm down, I'm police.
Stop talking and stay still!

120
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,960
My ID's in my jacket, I'm AC-12.

121
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,940
Stop talking and stay still!

122
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,679
Lose the phone.

123
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,940
Get everyone out. All right, everyone out!

124
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,799
Got the wrong guy.

125
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,679
All clear, sir!

126
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Dot?

127
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,960
Steven Arnott, I'm arresting you

128
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,960
on suspicion of murdering Lindsay Denton.

129
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,960
You do not have to say anything

130
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,960
but it may harm your defence if you
do not mention, when questioned,

131
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,960
something you later rely on in court.

132
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,940
Anything you do say may
be used in evidence.

133
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,960
What's going on? You know. Keep your
mouth shut till you get a lawyer.

134
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,879
I'm trying to do you a
favour. Get him out.

135
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,940
DI Cottan, DS Arnott. You all
right to book him in for me?

136
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,960
Need to take his clothes for forensics

137
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,960
before he goes in his cell.

138
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,960
Steven Arnott, I'm satisfied
that your arrest is lawful.

139
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,940
I'm authorising your detention in
this police station in order that we

140
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,960
can secure and preserve evidence
in this investigation, and to obtain

141
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,940
evidence from you by questioning.
I will also speak to an inspector

142
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,960
to authorise you being held
incommunicado at this time,

143
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,960
delaying your right to have
anyone told you're here,

144
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
or to make any calls.

145
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,799
Do you understand?

146
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,960
DS Arnott, can you account
for your whereabouts between

147
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
0800 and 1200 hours on
July 17th this year?

148
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,940
I was at home.

149
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,960
This would be your home address
-- Flat 5, Kings Gate Apartments?

150
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,940
Yes.

151
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Who were you with?

152
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,399
Between those hours I was alone.

153
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,960
And your girlfriend, DS
Samantha Railston, where was she?

154
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,940
Sam left early for work.

155
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,940
Around 0630.

156
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,960
I was alone in the flat
but I made phone calls.

157
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,139
They'll prove where I was.

158
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,960
Document 3 in your folders.

159
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,940
Document 3 is a photocopy
of item reference ASJ-3,

160
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:00,940
telecommunications record for
mobile phone 07591152425,

161
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,960
registered to Steven Arnott.

162
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,940
Three calls are shown.

163
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,299
Can you tell us what was
happening with these calls?

164
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,940
I'd realised Lindsay had
stolen my pocketbook.

165
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,960
I called her from my flat, but
it went straight to her voicemail.

166
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,960
I went to her approved premises
to try and track her down

167
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,960
but she wasn't there, so I
tried calling her again.

168
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,960
And the call to the AC-12 switchboard?

169
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
To report the theft of my
service vehicle. Thank you.

170
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
When was the last time you
saw Lindsay Denton alive?

171
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,940
The night before. My flat.

172
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,940
Lindsay had a theory
that Danny Waldron left

173
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,960
a list of abusers in a graveyard.

174
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,960
We were searching online
burial records for a name that

175
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,960
might have been a memorable
association for Danny.

176
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,960
She left my flat and I went
to the graveyard alone.

177
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,960
Must have been while she was in my
flat that she took my pocketbook.

178
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,960
At this time, myself and DI
Cottan were carrying out direct

179
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,960
surveillance on Steve Arnott's flat,

180
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,960
authorised by Superintendant Hastings,

181
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,940
under the Regulation of
Investigatory Powers Act 2000.

182
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:06,960
Noted.

183
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,960
We saw you and Lindsay split up.

184
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,960
And after you'd left, she looked
like the cat who'd got the cream.

185
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,960
She sent you off on a wild
goose chase while she went

186
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,940
and cracked the case. Cos, actually,
Danny had hidden the list online.

187
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,940
She found the list? She did indeed.

188
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,960
You gotta hand it to her,
she got the job done.

189
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,399
And she made a total mug of you.

190
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,960
Now, these phone calls
we've been talking about,

191
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,960
they're all around noon onwards.

192
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
None of them corroborate you being
in your flat before that time.

193
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,940
The proprietor of the internet caff,

194
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,940
now, she reckons she saw Denton
leave around... 11, 11.30.

195
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,960
She didn't see where
Denton went or who she met,

196
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,960
and we've no information
on her whereabouts

197
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,940
until her body was discovered at 12.30.

198
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,960
But you were at home all this time?

199
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Yes, sir. So what were
you doing all this time?

200
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,940
DS Arnott? I slept.

201
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,960
You had a kip? Seriously?

202
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,960
I'd been up most of the night.

203
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,960
You didn't think of
calling her straightaway?

204
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,940
No, sir.

205
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,960
She'd sent you to this
graveyard on a fool's errand,

206
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,960
stolen your pocketbook.

207
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,960
I'd have been after her like a shot.

208
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
You, you're stuck to your sofa
watching Homes Under The Hammer.

209
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,679
I got home late.

210
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,940
Sam, my girlfriend, and I -- we had a row.

211
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,940
I had some wine and I fell
asleep on the sofa. I overslept.

212
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,960
As soon as I realised my
pocketbook was gone, I took action.

213
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,960
Still, you were sorely pissed
off with her, weren't you?

214
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,960
DS Arnott is simply stating
the facts. Oh, right.

215
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,940
So you weren't pissed off with her?

216
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,960
In the early hours of the 17th,

217
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,960
I followed Mr Arnott to the
graveyard of St Barnabas Church.

218
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,940
In which he stated,

219
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,960
"If there's no list here

220
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,940
"then Lindsay's going
to get what's coming."

221
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,940
Can you tell us what you
meant by those words?

222
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,539
I was angry.

223
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,960
Angry with Kate. Angry with Lindsay.

224
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,960
I didn't MEAN anything.

225
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,960
But you do admit that you
were angry with Lindsay?

226
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,960
Those words go way beyond angry.

227
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I didn't kill Lindsay.

228
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,960
At her trial, Lindsay testified that

229
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,940
there was a sexual
relationship between you.

230
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,960
The relevant section for the
transcript is document 46.

231
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,940
I don't need a transcript
-- she was lying.

232
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:31,960
Data retrieval from Lindsay's mobile

233
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,940
resulted in detection
of the following file --

234
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,940
item reference MKJ-32.

235
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
For the tape, I will now play MKJ-32.

236
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,960
'Is that OK?'

237
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,279
'Yeah.'

238
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,399
'You OK?'

239
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,960
'Yeah.'

240
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,960
You recognise the voices
on this audio file?

241
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Me and Lindsay. And can you tell
us where the recording was made?

242
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,940
In her bedroom.

243
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
And were you aware at the time
that this recording was being made?

244
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,940
No, sir, I was not. As DS Arnott
didn't give his permission,

245
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:27,960
the recording was illegal.

246
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,940
Still... it's not a nice thing
to do to someone, though.

247
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,960
Just another thing she did to put
a few more winds on your clock, eh?

248
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,940
Time and time again you
denied any impropriety.

249
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,960
What you can't know is that
we're both almost fully clothed

250
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,960
and the file's been abridged.
If you'd had the opportunity

251
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,960
to continue listening you'd have heard

252
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
that we stopped through
mutual consent. Stopped? What?

253
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
There was some kissing. Some touching.

254
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,940
Lindsay became upset and I comforted
her. Sir, I give you my word,

255
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,940
Lindsay Denton and I did not have sex.

256
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,940
Your word.

257
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,960
Whatever your version
is of that audio file,

258
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,960
it sounds like you pair went
way beyond the professional.

259
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,960
And then she used it to
discredit your case against her.

260
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,960
Now, I don't know many blokes who
wouldn't be angry about that.

261
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,940
And thanks to her accusations
you are suspended, your career

262
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,880
potentially in ruins.

263
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,940
Now, for the tape -- on screen is image 5.

264
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,940
Image 5 is a crime scene photograph
taken at 12.45 on July 17th,

265
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,940
showing the body of Lindsay Denton.

266
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,940
Image 8.

267
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,960
That's my car. Image 8 is a crime
scene photograph showing the vehicle

268
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,940
in which Lindsay Denton's body was found.

269
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,940
It's a dark grey Volvo S60.

270
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
You agree it's your car?

271
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,940
As I've said, sir, I
reported my vehicle stolen.

272
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,960
Document 6 in your folders.

273
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,940
Document 6 is a photocopy
of item reference IKL-1.

274
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,940
IKL-1 is the log for service vehicles.

275
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,940
On July 1st you signed out service
vehicle Foxtrot Juliet 1-4 Romeo

276
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,960
Charlie Zulu, and it was
never signed back in.

277
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,940
You should've. The
second you were suspended.

278
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,960
It's a perk of the job. Didn't
want to give up the motor.

279
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,940
So, it's a matter of fact that
this vehicle was in your possession

280
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,960
at the time of the murder. The fact,
sir, is someone stole the vehicle.

281
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,400
And you reported it stolen when?

282
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,940
In the call made to the
AC-12 switchboard at 11.59.

283
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,960
Yeah, but Lindsay was last seen
alive up to an hour earlier.

284
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,960
At the internet caff. Now, that is
plenty of time for you to get home

285
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,960
and report your car stolen. I reported
the theft as soon as I realised.

286
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,599
The car must have been stolen earlier.

287
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,279
I see.

288
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,960
Document 7 is a copy of the
pathologist's report following

289
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,940
a postmortem examination
of Lindsay Denton.

290
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,940
The cause of death was a single
gunshot wound to the head.

291
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,940
Image 6. Image 6 is a forensic
photograph of item reference NJC-4.

292
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,960
Item NJC-4 is a bullet found
lodged in the passenger-side trim

293
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,940
of service vehicle Foxtrot
Juliet 1-4 Romeo Charlie Zulu.

294
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,940
NJC-4 has been identified as
a 9x19mm Parabellum round.

295
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,940
Image 13.

296
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,940
Image 13 shows item reference SCS-9.

297
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,940
SCS-9 is a service-issue
firearm, Glock 17 pistol,

298
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,940
serial number -- November
Mike 8-4-9-4-7-4-8.

299
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,960
The Glock 17 was found a short
distance from the vehicle

300
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,940
containing the body of Lindsay Denton.

301
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,960
Document 11 in your
folders -- also on screen.

302
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,940
Document 11 is the firearms issue
log from South Ferry armoury.

303
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,940
You'll see a highlighted entry
on the morning of July 13th,

304
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,940
relating to said Glock 17, serial
number November Mike 8-4-9-4-7-4-8.

305
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,960
Said firearm was never returned.

306
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,940
No. I returned my firearm a few
days before Lindsay was murdered.

307
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,940
Not according to these records. No. No.

308
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,960
I returned it. Ask them at the
armoury, they'll confirm it.

309
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,940
It's here in black and white, son.

310
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
You always follow the regs
when it comes to firearms?

311
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,960
DS Arnott was seen bearing a firearm
within this building that did not,

312
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,940
in my view, meet satisfactory
operational requirement.

313
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,940
On July 13th I gave DS Arnott
a verbal warning that he was

314
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
in breach of Section 7
of the 1968 Firearms Act.

315
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,960
What forensics do you have
linking me to the crime scene?

316
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,940
Your car, your gun --
I'd say that's plenty.

317
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,960
Were my fingerprints on the gun?

318
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,960
There were no fingerprints
found on the firearm at all.

319
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,960
It appeared to have been
wiped. Right. So no prints.

320
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,960
Lindsay Denton was shot at close range.

321
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,940
The vehicle interior shows a
substantial blood spatter pattern.

322
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,940
Did you find blood particles on me?

323
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,940
At the time of Steve Arnott's arrest, his
clothing was seized for forensic examination.

324
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,960
There were no traces of blood
or gunshot residue detected.

325
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,960
Yeah, but anyone with half
a brain, covered in blood

326
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,960
and gunshot residue, would know
to dispose of his clothing.

327
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,960
So where's this clothing? You tell us.

328
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,940
Why would I shoot Lindsay in my own car?

329
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,960
I know the forensics would be
totally incriminating. Correct.

330
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,960
They are. So I wouldn't have done it!

331
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,960
You were at the end of your
tether with Lindsay Denton.

332
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,960
She betrayed you, manipulated
you, deceived you and, finally,

333
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,960
she discredited you. You
weren't thinking straight!

334
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,960
So I used my service-issue
firearm that I left at the scene?

335
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,940
And I used my registered service
vehicle? I mean, that's just stupid!

336
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,960
You panicked. You left
your bullet and the casing

337
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,960
and you didn't do a good
enough job disposing of the gun.

338
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,960
Then you cobble together some story
about your motor being nicked.

339
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,960
In fact, the only thing
you didn't make a hash of

340
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,960
was the bloodstained clothing.

341
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,079
That's not what happened.

342
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,940
Image 22 shows item reference EDC-3,
found in said service vehicle.

343
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,960
Can you tell us what item EDC-3 is?

344
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,940
My pocketbook.

345
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,960
And is that the one stolen
by Lindsay? Yes, sir.

346
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,940
So you went after her to get it
back... things got out of hand

347
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,960
and in your panic you didn't
even remember to take it.

348
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,960
I didn't take it because I wasn't there!

349
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,940
So you've said. Is there anyone
-- anyone -- that we can talk to

350
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,960
who will bear witness to
the fact you were at home

351
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
during the time of
Lindsay Denton's murder?

352
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,940
I had my issues with Lindsay
Denton, I can't deny that.

353
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,740
But I wouldn't kill her. So you've said.

354
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,940
I didn't have that gun.

355
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
So if I didn't return it, why
didn't anyone try and recover it?

356
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
DS Arnott's asked a
very important question.

357
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,960
Yes, well, I admit there was
a failure to do due diligence

358
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,960
on the part of the officers
at South Ferry armoury,

359
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,960
but I've written to the
Strategic Firearms Commander

360
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,960
making my feelings on the
matter abundantly clear

361
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,960
and I can assure you,
disciplinary action...

362
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,960
No-one realised because I
HAD returned the firearm!

363
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,960
Someone must have access to the
booking-out forms and replaced

364
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,960
the real one -- the one showing
I surrendered the gun --

365
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,960
with a forgery. Yeah, but this same
someone would had to have signed out

366
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,960
the same gun that was
used in the murder --

367
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,960
and where's the record of
that? It's the same thing,

368
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,960
sir -- stolen so no-one can
track who's got the weapon.

369
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:17,960
All right, let me get this straight.

370
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,940
What you're saying is that some
impostor acquired the firearm

371
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,960
and then tampered with the paperwork
to cover his tracks. Yes, sir.

372
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,960
Obviously the same person who stole
my service vehicle that morning.

373
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,940
So your defence is,

374
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,960
"It wasn't me, it was
just some random impostor"?

375
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,960
No, not random.

376
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,940
To know it's extremely difficult
to steal a service-issue firearm

377
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,960
but not actually all that
difficult to fake the paperwork --

378
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,960
that takes inside knowledge. This
was done by a police officer.

379
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,960
But apparently it's a piece of cake
to steal a service-issue vehicle

380
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,940
fitted with deadlocks and an immobiliser.

381
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
I have to say, this is all
sounding a bit far-fetched, son.

382
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,940
There's a parallel on this case, sir.

383
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,960
Ever since we started
investigating Danny Waldron --

384
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,960
first his shooting of Ronan
Murphy, then Danny's murder --

385
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,960
there have been holes that the
evidence hasn't completely filled,

386
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,960
one of which is the
murder of PC Rod Kennedy.

387
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,960
Sir, this is a massive tangent.

388
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,960
DS Arnott knows we have to charge or
release and he's playing for time.

389
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,960
Sir, DI Cottan was too quick
to close the investigation

390
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,960
into Kennedy's murder, just like he
was with his inquiry into The Caddy.

391
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,960
He's doing the same thing here.

392
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,960
He's cutting corners, not
challenging evidence robustly,

393
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,940
and I'm the one suffering
for his negligence!

394
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,960
Sir, DS Arnott's casting aspersions
for one reason and one reason only --

395
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,960
to discredit this case,

396
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,960
to get AC-12 taken off the
investigation against him.

397
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,960
It's what these coppers do when you
know you've got 'em bang to rights --

398
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,960
exploit their knowledge of the
system to try and tie us in knots.

399
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,960
Look, I'd be really grateful if
we could just stick to the issue

400
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
in hand here, which is the
murder of Lindsay Denton.

401
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,940
Thank you, sir.

402
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,960
Now, with respect to service
vehicle Foxtrot Juliet 1-4 Romeo

403
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,940
Charlie Zulu, a forensic search was
carried out at the crime scene.

404
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,940
Image 43. Interior of
service vehicle boot.

405
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,940
Image 45. Image 45 is
item reference VCT-7.

406
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,960
Do you recognise VCT-7?

407
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,940
My gym bag.

408
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:17,960
Image 46.

409
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,940
Image 46 shows the contents

410
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,940
of VCT-7 -- sports clothing and trainers.

411
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,940
Image 47 -- That was not in my bag!

412
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
What...?! What is going on
here?! DS Arnott, please.

413
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,940
Image 47...

414
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,960
shows item reference VCT-9.

415
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,940
VCT-9 is an unregistered
pay-as-you-go mobile phone.

416
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,960
Your phone, DS Arnott? No, sir!

417
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,400
No, sir, someone put that there.

418
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,940
VCT-9 is a phone of the type
reportedly associated with

419
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,960
covert criminal communications.
That is not my phone.

420
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,960
What the hell is it doing in your gym bag?

421
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,960
DS Arnott denies any knowledge
of the phone, there's clearly some

422
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,960
irregularity with the search. My
department carries out its searches

423
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,960
to the letter of the law, fella!

424
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,940
The letter!

425
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,940
Document 19 in your folders.

426
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,940
For the tape,

427
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,960
this is a partial transcript
of Lindsay Denton's retrial.

428
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,960
At Lindsay Denton's first trial
she was convicted of conspiracy

429
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,960
to murder, and the prosecution
hung on crucial evidence

430
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,940
found at her home address, namely
50 grand in cash that was linked

431
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,940
via financial forensics to other
bribes employed in the conspiracy.

432
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,140
I didn't plant that money.

433
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:33,960
Image 49.

434
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,940
Image 49 shows item reference VCT-11.

435
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Now, VCT-11 is a? 5 note.

436
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,880
Is that your? 5 note?

437
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,940
I don't remember having
any money in the bag.

438
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,960
Not your phone, now it's
not your money either.

439
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,960
I'm saying I don't recall if I
was carrying any money in the bag.

440
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,940
Fair enough.

441
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,960
That was in the inside pocket.

442
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,940
It's only a fiver. It's easy to forget.

443
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,940
We ran forensics on that? 5 note.

444
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,940
Document 20 in your folders.

445
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,940
DC Fleming.

446
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,960
For the tape, I'm
referring to document 20.

447
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,960
Document 20 is a photocopy
of an original report

448
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,940
made by the financial forensics unit.

449
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,940
Report Sierra Alpha/56-57/1-5.

450
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,940
The summary reads --

451
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,940
"Pollen particles detected on
banknote VCT-11 show a close match

452
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,940
"to pollen particles detected
on banknotes AJK-72."

453
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,940
AJK-72 is the item
reference for the? 50,000

454
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,960
found at Lindsay Denton's
home. There is no way!

455
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:38,960
Look, just...

456
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,960
That is not my money! A second
ago you couldn't even remember.

457
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,960
There is no way that I'd have
money that was from the same source

458
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:45,960
as Lindsay Denton's bribe!

459
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,960
But Lindsay Denton knew
you planted that evidence,

460
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,960
and she was your most vociferous accuser.

461
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,960
So maybe she was onto this evidence,
too. She wasn't onto any evidence!

462
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,960
She couldn't have known about this!
Oh, right, so you hid it from her?

463
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,960
I didn't mean it like that. That
money would be very hard to come by.

464
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,960
But together with the phone
this indicates a clear

465
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
pattern of corrupt conduct. I am not bent!

466
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,960
This is obviously a very...

467
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,960
difficult experience, Steve.

468
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,940
Would you like some time
alone with your solicitor?

469
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:20,960
No.

470
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,940
Very well, but can we
all just calm down here

471
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,940
and not let our emotions
get the better of us?

472
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:27,960
Sir.

473
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,940
So, moving on.

474
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,940
In respect of another murder,
that of Sergeant Daniel Waldron,

475
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,940
have you any comment to make?
Waldron was murdered by Hari Bains.

476
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,940
Bains confessed and
intends to plead guilty.

477
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,960
Yeah, well, Bains owed gambling
debts to the wrong people.

478
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,940
And we believe they contracted
him to kill Waldron. Indeed.

479
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,940
Significantly, Bains received a
call the night of the 31st of May

480
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,940
from a phone of the
type found in your car.

481
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,960
Night before he shot and
killed Danny Waldron.

482
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,960
According to Bains, in a
statement made on June 30th,

483
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
the caller had a London/South East accent.

484
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,940
So? So, was that you?
London and South East

485
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,960
have such small populations,
it could only have been me(!)

486
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,960
Kindly just answer the
question, please, DS Arnott.

487
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,960
Bains and I met loads of times. He
would have known my voice and been

488
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,940
able to identify, the call was clearly
made by another person unknown.

489
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,960
Yes, and you're familiar with the
putative corrupt police officer

490
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
codename The Caddy?

491
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,200
I am.

492
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
DI Cottan. Sir.

493
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,960
Assimilation of all credible witness
testimony, based on direct contact

494
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,940
with said individual, leads
to the following profile.

495
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,940
The Caddy is male.

496
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,960
The Caddy is almost certainly
from a working-class background

497
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,960
and grew up in an urban environment.

498
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,940
Is probably under 35.

499
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,940
He is almost certainly a detective.

500
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,960
He's trained in covert operations
such as counterterrorism.

501
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,960
And all earwitnesses report
The Caddy as having a London

502
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,940
or South East accent.

503
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,940
This is insane.

504
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,940
God help me, son, I wish it was. Sir!

505
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,940
That's your evidence? A profile?
We've more than just a profile.

506
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,960
Only The Caddy would have had access
to the same source of bribe money

507
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,960
found at Lindsay Denton's house.

508
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
The same supply we found some
of in your service vehicle boot.

509
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Would you like some more time, DS Arnott?

510
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,940
No.

511
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,960
DI Cottan originally volunteered
to investigate The Caddy

512
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,960
and closed the case prematurely,
based on flimsy evidence

513
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,960
provided by an old colleague.

514
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,960
Yes, but we're not here
to discuss DI Cottan.

515
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,940
Sir, he's just looking at some
angles to try and discredit this...

516
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,740
I intend to be heard, sir. On the record.

517
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,279
Very well. That's your right.

518
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,940
DI Cottan, you carried out the
original inquiry into The Caddy.

519
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,960
I did. That wrongly identified
DC Jeremy Cole. Yes.

520
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,960
Based purely on the testimony
of your former colleague,

521
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,960
DC Nigel Morton. Yeah, but Morton
has since revised his statement.

522
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,000
DI Cottan and DC Fleming are
reopening that particular inquiry.

523
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,960
You also failed to order a
second postmortem on the body

524
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,960
of Rod Kennedy. My e-mail
bounced back, as well you know.

525
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,960
Sir, he's clutching at straws here.

526
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,960
In respect of the original
inquiry into the murder

527
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,960
of Sergeant Danny Waldron, you
led a search of Waldron's flat.

528
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,960
I did. And as part of that
search you found an envelope

529
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,960
addressed to me. Yes. And the
forensics that you failed to

530
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,960
carry out on the inside of that
envelope detected traces of ink

531
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,960
and blood, suggesting it contained
a note written by Danny Waldron

532
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,960
and PRESUMABLY intended for me.

533
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,960
No note was ever found. Danny
Waldron saved his list online.

534
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,960
Which we only discovered weeks later
cos you failed to pursue this lead!

535
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,960
I did not. The note had
been in that envelope!

536
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,539
That's not what was in the envelope!

537
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,940
Item reference MRC-1.

538
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,940
Item reference MRC-1 is the envelope
recovered from Danny Waldron's flat.

539
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,940
And for the tape, Mr Arnott is quite
correct -- it does bear his name.

540
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,960
Item reference MRC-2 is the
contents of the envelope.

541
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,960
This item was entered
into evidence separately,

542
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:39,960
for reasons of internal security.

543
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,960
You will see in your folders
document appendix 1 refers to

544
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,940
sequestered evidence.

545
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,960
Sequestration of evidence
authorised by Gill Bigelow,

546
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
leading legal council to
Anti-Corruption Unit 12.

547
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,400
This is what was in the envelope.

548
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,960
Now, for the tape, I'm showing Mr
Arnott the sequestered evidence --

549
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
a white golf tee.

550
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,940
Steve Arnott.

551
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,400
Golf tee.

552
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
I think Danny Waldron was
trying to tell us something.

553
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Have you got anything
further to add, DS Arnott?

554
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
For the tape, the interviewee
is shaking his head.

555
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,940
Steven Arnott,

556
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,960
you will remain under arrest for
the murder of Lindsay Denton.

557
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,960
I will now seek guidance from
the Crown Prosecutor as to how

558
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,960
to charge you for said offence.

559
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,940
You will be taken to a place of custody.

560
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,960
If you're not charged within
24 hours of the original arrest

561
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,940
you will be released, however I...

562
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,960
will seek the authority
for a 12-hour extension.

563
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,960
Is all this understood?

564
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,940
Yes, sir.

565
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Interview discontinued.

566
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
God help me if I ever get
a good night's sleep again.

567
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,940
DI Cottan...

568
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,960
my office, five minutes.

569
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,199
Sir.

570
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
You OK?

571
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,960
That can't have been easy.

572
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,400
Well done.

573
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Sorry.

574
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,960
Just when exactly did you get the
idea of sequestering evidence from me?

575
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,940
Hm? In 35 years, this has been
my worst day in the service,

576
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,960
and now this little incident
just about caps the whole lot!

577
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,940
Was it your idea to go behind
my back or was it yours?

578
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,940
To be fair to DI Cottan, he
sought me out for guidance.

579
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,960
It was my decision to sequester the
evidence from Danny Waldron's flat

580
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,940
because of its sensitive nature
in regard to a fellow officer.

581
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,960
It seemed a bizarre and
possibly meaningless find, sir,

582
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,940
but I just had a feeling... "Feeling"?

583
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,960
.. that it might alert
Steve. And if it had of done

584
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,960
then we wouldn't have had
all this other evidence.

585
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,960
Oh, yeah, you're on very
thin ice with me, DI Cottan.

586
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,940
Are there any other surprises in store?

587
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
I hope not, sir. I hope not, too.

588
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,940
Dismissed!

589
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,199
Sir.

590
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,960
At the time, neither DI Cottan nor I
knew if the golf tee was relevant.

591
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,940
Clearly, recent events have created
a more significant context. Clearly!

592
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,940
I can see you're angry, Ted, but the
fact that you personally recruited

593
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,960
Steve Arnott did weigh on my decision.

594
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,960
What, you decided I was going to be
biased? I'm sorry, but at the time

595
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,960
it felt like the right decision.
Now, can we just calm down?

596
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
I am calm! I'm totally bloody calm!

597
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,940
Look, I know this is abysmal timing

598
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,960
but former Chief Superintendant
Patrick Fairbank's legal team

599
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,960
are applying for the child sex
abuse charges to be dropped.

600
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:12,960
What?

601
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,960
They're saying that he repeatedly
stated in his interviews that,

602
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,940
"I'm not as sharp as I used to
be." Yeah, I know he said that.

603
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,960
They're saying that an independent
physician should have examined

604
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
his intellectual fitness for interview.

605
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,940
They're having his GP attest
he's got senile dementia.

606
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,940
He isn't fit to stand trial.

607
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,599
Mother of God.

608
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,960
DS Arnott has to be
charged or released today.

609
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Don't delay your call
to the Crown Prosecutor.

610
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:47,960
Fine.

611
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,400
Thank you.

612
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,940
Superintendant Hastings for the
Senior Crime Prosecutor, please.

613
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:58,960
Hastings.

614
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,280
That's right, like the battle.

615
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Come in. Sir.

616
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,480
Anything to avoid making this call.

617
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,960
Listen, sir, before you
call the Crown Prosecutor,

618
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,960
there's some things we need to discuss.

619
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,940
This is a favour to her, not you.

620
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Two minutes.

621
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,880
It's good to see you.

622
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,139
Is there anything I can do?

623
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,940
You can say you don't
believe a word of it.

624
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,940
Of course I don't.

625
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,940
Sam...

626
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,280
My DCI's got me on desk duty.

627
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,960
She asked me outright if
I was in on it with you.

628
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,940
I'm innocent.

629
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,539
Yeah, I know.

630
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,679
Well, you came.

631
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,400
I'm glad.

632
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,940
I'm sorry about the flat being
closed for forensics. It's fine.

633
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,960
I'm at a friend's place.

634
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:27,000
They've gotta release me in a few
hours, so we can be back in soon.

635
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Steve...

636
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Sorry.

637
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:03,000
So which one were you looking at?
Which one were you...? That...

638
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,940
You still haven't charged Steve
Arnott. We need more time.

639
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,960
I know it's difficult going
after one of your own...

640
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,940
It's what we do for a living.

641
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,960
DC Fleming has caused me

642
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,960
to want to re-examine the
evidence against Steve Arnott.

643
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,940
Come on, Ted, there's
a mountain of evidence.

644
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:27,940
His gun. The car. The money. The threat.

645
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,940
Motive, opportunity, means.

646
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,960
During the interview with
Steven Arnott I indentified

647
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,960
a number of issues that
merit further examination.

648
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,940
Of course you want to believe that
Steve's innocent. Of course you do.

649
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,940
But you're jumping to rash and
extremely damaging conclusions.

650
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,940
DC Fleming, please.

651
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,960
Miss Bigelow, you do
not have to say anything

652
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,960
but it may harm your defence
if you do not... Excuse me.

653
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,940
Gill, please, this is necessary.

654
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,960
You do not have to say anything
but it may harm your defence

655
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,960
if you do not mention, when questioned,

656
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,960
something you later rely on in court.

657
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,960
Anything you do say may
be used in evidence.

658
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,960
It's been a long day and
night, let's get a grip, Ted.

659
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,960
Did you furnish Superintendant
Hastings with an intelligence file

660
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,960
relating to Ronan Murphy,

661
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,000
the suspect shot dead by Sergeant
Danny Waldron on the 13th of May?

662
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,940
I did. And from who did
you obtain that file?

663
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,940
"Whom."

664
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,960
It was supplied to me in confidence

665
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,960
and to reveal the source would
be a betrayal of that confidence.

666
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,960
Gill, you're under caution.

667
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,000
It would help us enormously if
you could provide an answer.

668
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Very well. Show her.

669
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,960
This is a signed authority from
Superintendant Summers at AC-3

670
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,960
for me to conduct an undercover
operation against AC-12 officers.

671
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,960
I see what it is. When did this happen?
I only found about this this evening.

672
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,960
Under said authority, I
obtained evidence that this file

673
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,940
originated from DS Nicola
Rogerson at Major Violent Crime.

674
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,960
In a written statement, DS
Rogerson claims that the file was

675
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:08,940
"requested" by an AC-12 officer.
Did an AC-12 officer furnish you

676
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,739
with this file on condition of anonymity?

677
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,199
Yes.

678
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,940
DS Rogerson's copy of the file
did not contain the omissions

679
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,960
made to the one you received.

680
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,960
I was given that file in good faith

681
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,940
and I completely deny tampering with it.

682
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:26,960
No-one's suggesting you did.

683
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,940
What we're exploring here
is that the alterations

684
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,940
were made by said AC-12 officer.

685
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Now, can you confirm the name
we've heard from Rogerson?

686
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,199
Fine.

687
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Detective Inspector Matthew Cottan.

688
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,940
He brought you the golf tee...

689
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,940
so we assumed that he would
have brought you file, good.

690
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:05,000
DC Fleming, would you kindly
excuse us for a moment, please?

691
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,679
Thank you, Kate.

692
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,960
You're barking up the wrong tree.

693
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,940
Matthew Cottan has done a first-rate
job of rooting out a bad apple.

694
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,960
Gill... As for the file, he
knew we were being obstructed,

695
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,960
so he obtained it through
unofficial channels.

696
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,960
Why didn't he just give it to me?

697
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,960
Because he was afraid you'd give him

698
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,940
a dressing-down for
acting improperly. Gill...

699
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,960
even after the time we spent together,

700
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:46,000
you really don't know me at all.

701
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,960
This is a video capture taken
from a traffic camera situated

702
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,960
on the Kings Gate Expressway showing
traffic at the time indicated

703
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,960
in the top right-hand corner.

704
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,940
9.46. Steve's car.

705
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,199
At first glance, yes, but...

706
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:08,960
Different reg.

707
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,940
Correct. Here are more
traffic camera images,

708
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,940
this same vehicle captured
travelling through the city centre

709
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,940
on traffic cameras a few minutes apart.

710
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Image enhancement has failed
to show who's driving.

711
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:24,960
Now, here's a street map.

712
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,960
This street map shows the
locations of the vehicle at times

713
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,940
corresponding to the exact times
of the traffic camera images.

714
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,960
I'm now going to add the location
of the internet cafe where

715
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Lindsay Denton was last
seen alive that morning.

716
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,940
Someone was driving the vehicle to
Lindsay's location that morning.

717
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,940
Yeah. And previous to the internet
cafe, Lindsay Denton was last seen

718
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,960
at her approved premises the night before.

719
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,940
I'm now going to add the location
of the approved premises.

720
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,960
There's an hour's delay in the
timeline of the vehicle's movements,

721
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,940
suggesting it hung around the
approved premises during this time.

722
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,000
So... Lindsay was followed
to the internet cafe.

723
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,960
Looks like it, sir. And
correct me if I'm wrong,

724
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,960
but this is the same time that
Steve said that he was home alone?

725
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:11,960
Yeah, that's correct, sir.

726
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,940
Steve doesn't have an alibi so it
could be him driving that vehicle.

727
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,940
Hmm. One final thing.

728
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,960
I've indentified this registration

729
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,940
as belonging to another
make and model entirely.

730
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,940
They're fake plates.

731
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,960
Well done. Well done. I think
you'd better get that wee one home,

732
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,000
and thanks very much for coming in.

733
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,940
Why would Steve be driving
his own car with fake plates?

734
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,940
To hide his movements?

735
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,960
It doesn't make sense, sir, she
wouldn't have got in the car.

736
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,960
If Steve turned up with
fake plates she'd have known

737
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,960
he was up to something.
She would never get in.

738
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:56,960
Or maybe she just didn't see it.

739
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,940
We all know Lindsay, sir, she
never missed a thing. Hm.

740
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Sorry, Kate, you couldn't give us
a hand with the lift? Yeah, sure.

741
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,940
Off the record,

742
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,960
DI Cottan put pressure on me not
to tell Steve about the additional

743
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,000
forensics on the envelope
found in Danny Waldron's flat.

744
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,679
Cheers, Maneet.

745
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,940
He's here, sir. And?

746
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,480
Well, I can't say he's very happy.

747
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,000
DC Morton, would you mind coming with us?

748
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,940
DC Morton.

749
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,960
I'm not coming anywhere
till I get some assurances.

750
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,940
Assurances of what?

751
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,940
Four things.

752
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,000
I-mmu-ni-ty.

753
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Sir.

754
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
DI Cottan.

755
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,139
Questions about what, sir?

756
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,400
When do you want to do this, sir?

757
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,199
No. No, I'm happy to assist.

758
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,400
All right.

759
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Let's do this.

760
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,340
Morning.

761
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,940
A word to the wise --

762
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,960
Arnott or Cottan, if either
turns out to be a bad apple,

763
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:10,960
he's acting alone.

764
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,960
They can't be connected
to any wider conspiracy.

765
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,940
Let's see.

766
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,960
And Patrick Fairbank the same.

767
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,940
We feel his legal team have a strong case,

768
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,960
his dementia precludes a trial.

769
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,960
He might have forgotten some
important details. Exactly.

770
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,940
Or worse still...

771
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,960
he might remember them.

772
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,940
What are you saying?

773
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,960
You see, I finally understand why
you were appointed by the PCC.

774
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,960
I'm the loose cannon here.

775
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,960
If I see a bent copper I'll go after him

776
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,940
irrespective of rank
or political expediency.

777
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,940
I'm not going to apologise
for having one eye on PR.

778
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,960
Anti-corruption is a double-edged sword.

779
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,960
We need to find just enough bent
coppers to avoid accusations of

780
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,960
a cover-up but no so many that
the public starts to wonder

781
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,960
if the police can be trusted.

782
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,960
So we let Patrick Fairbank
just slip through the net?

783
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,960
Because of all the peers
and the politicians

784
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,960
and the police officers
he might implicate?

785
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,940
Meanwhile, we go back to chasing
disc jockeys and game show hosts?

786
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,960
I'm just doing my job. And I'm doing mine.

787
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,960
And it's called nicking
bent coppers and I don't care

788
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,960
whether it's one rotten apple
or the whole bloody barrel.

789
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,960
There's a line and it's
called right and wrong.

790
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,960
And I know which side...

791
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,940
my duty lies.

792
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,960
So why don't you write a nice
letter of resignation to the PCC

793
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,940
or I swear to God...

794
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,000
I will drag you down
with the rest of them.

795
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,960
In last night's interview
of DS Arnott you produced

796
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:04,940
a piece of evidence --
item reference MRC-2 --

797
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,940
namely the golf tee and the envelope
found at Danny Waldron's flat.

798
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,960
Wonder if you can explain
in a little bit more detail

799
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,940
how you came by this piece of evidence?

800
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,960
I'm not sure I understand
what you're driving at, sir.

801
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,960
Well, there were half a
dozen of you on that search,

802
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,960
how come no-one else saw it?

803
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,960
Did you swear them all to secrecy or what?

804
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,940
Oh, I see, sir.

805
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,940
No, what happened was -- we
detected an illegal firearm.

806
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,960
I sent an officer to bring someone
with firearms training urgently,

807
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,960
so as to secure the firearm.

808
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,940
I had the legitimate concern it
wasn't safe or it was booby-trapped

809
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:43,940
and it was then I saw the
golf tee in the envelope. So...

810
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,940
with no-one else watching you...

811
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,000
you seized this piece
of evidence? Yes, sir.

812
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,960
Did you order forensics on the golf tee?

813
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,960
I did but there were
no noticeable findings.

814
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,940
Did you order forensics on the
inside of the envelope? Yes, sir.

815
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,940
When? Well, this was something
we omitted in the first instance

816
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,940
but rectified as the inquiry progressed.

817
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,960
Did you put pressure on a
junior rank not to disclose

818
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,139
the forensics to DS Arnott?

819
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,940
Yes. Why?

820
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,960
Steve Arnott was concocting accusations

821
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,960
I wasn't doing my job properly.

822
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,960
I didn't want to give him
any ammunition. So...

823
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,960
you actually missed a
crucial piece of evidence.

824
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Well...

825
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:32,940
Forensics detected ink and blood
on the inside of that envelope.

826
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,940
That suggests there was
a bloodstained note

827
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,960
inside the envelope. There wasn't though.

828
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,940
No ink or blood on the golf tee. So, what?

829
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,960
Danny Waldron must have put it in
there after he removed the note?

830
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,940
Look, this note,

831
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,960
some people have been making
a mountain out of a molehill.

832
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,960
If it was such an issue, why
didn't I just pocket the envelope

833
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,960
and no-one would be any the wiser?

834
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,940
Which I didn't do, by the way.

835
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,960
Maybe the envelope had already
been seen by somebody else

836
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,000
on the search team, but
the contents hadn't.

837
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,940
I found a golf tee. I remained
in the vicinity of the firearm

838
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,940
until an officer arrived to make it safe.

839
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,960
Now, if that note went walkabout,
it's because Danny Waldron moved it

840
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,960
before we got there. In the
end, missing the forensics

841
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,960
made no difference to
the inquiry whatsoever.

842
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,940
That's one of the things we're
here to determine, DI Cottan

843
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,960
and I'll be the judge of that, thank you.

844
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
DC Fleming, moving on.

845
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:36,940
Item reference EGH-1. EGH-1 is an
intelligence file on Ronan Murphy,

846
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,940
the suspect shot dead by Danny Waldron.

847
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,960
It's where this whole inquiry
started, and it omitted information

848
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,960
that would have allowed us to
connect Ronan Murphy to known

849
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,960
high-ranking criminal Tommy Hunter,

850
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,000
and the cover-up of
historic child sexual abuse.

851
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,940
DI Cottan, have you seen
this file before? Yes, sir.

852
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,960
And who provided you
with access to this file?

853
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,940
You did, sir.

854
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:05,940
You see, my particular
concern here, DI Cottan...

855
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:11,000
is if you were familiar with this
file before I gave you access?

856
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,400
Do you have an answer, DI Cottan?

857
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,960
Yes, I was familiar with the file.

858
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,940
Yes.

859
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,960
And how were you familiar with it?

860
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,960
I acquired the file from a
former Major Violent Crime officer

861
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,960
involved in the investigation
into the murder of Tommy Hunter --

862
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,940
DS Rogerson.

863
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,960
I then passed it over to Gill
Bigelow. Yeah, not to me.

864
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,940
Not to DS Arnott, not to DC Fleming.

865
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,960
Well, I wanted to avoid Steven
Arnott. I think we all know why.

866
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,960
That file had crucial pieces
of information removed that held

867
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,960
this inquiry back for weeks. Yeah,
well, I'm sorry about that, sir,

868
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,960
but I took that file at
face value, in good faith.

869
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,960
And when we found out about
the missing information

870
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:53,960
why didn't you say something?

871
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,940
You should have been shouting that
from the rafters, man! No, sir. No.

872
00:57:57,980 --> 00:57:58,960
I didn't have the evidence yet

873
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,940
and I didn't want to
alert them beforehand.

874
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:02,960
Alert who?

875
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,940
Don't you see, sir?

876
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,000
DS Rogerson is a former
girlfriend of DS Arnott.

877
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:16,940
I'm sorry, sir. Weren't you aware
of the relationship between Rogerson

878
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,940
and Arnott?

879
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,940
No. I wasn't.

880
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,960
You should have told him, DC Fleming.

881
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,940
Spare the gaffer his blushes.

882
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,960
Well, the only person known
to have handled that file

883
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:32,940
apart from DS Rogerson
is you, not DS Arnott.

884
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,960
Well, the pair of them must have
hatched a plot to alter the file.

885
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,960
DS Rogerson denies altering the file.

886
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,960
Well, she would, wouldn't
she? Look, sounds to me

887
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,960
like this is another one
to throw at Steven Arnott.

888
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,960
I'm still exorcised by the
fact you didn't mention

889
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:48,940
any of this sooner. I don't cast
aspersions on fellow officers.

890
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,960
Unless I can back it
up with hard evidence.

891
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,139
Unlike some I can mention.

892
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
DC Fleming.

893
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,960
On screen, you'll see evidence
gathered in the case against

894
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,940
Harinderpal Bains.

895
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:12,940
Images 291 and 292 showing
item reference MR-3 and MR-4.

896
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,940
MR-3 and MR-4 are
unregistered mobile phones

897
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,940
recovered from Hari Bains' home.

898
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,940
So, what is this?

899
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,960
One of our own's about to be
charged with murder, I think

900
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,960
we're entitled to ask a
few questions, don't you?

901
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,940
Yeah, no, no, of course.
Whatever I can do to help.

902
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,960
These phones were provided
to Bains and he used them

903
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,960
to communicate with The
Caddy. A similar type of phone

904
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,960
was recovered from the boot of
DS Arnott's car. Yeah, well,

905
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,960
these are matters of fact in
the case against Steven Arnott.

906
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,960
Yeah, well, I'm just making
sure we all understand the facts

907
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,940
as they stand.

908
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,940
We'll return to the phone shortly.

909
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:51,940
Now, in last night's interview of DS
Arnott you stated that you'd attempted

910
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,960
to order a second postmortem
on the body of PC Rod Kennedy.

911
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,960
A search of e-mail records
found no e-mail from you

912
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,000
to the pathologist office
requesting said postmortem.

913
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,960
DI Cottan?

914
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Uh? Seriously?

915
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,960
You know what the IT system
is like in this building.

916
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,960
Just because it is not on the server,

917
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,960
that does not mean I didn't send it.

918
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:20,000
As a matter of fact, DI Cottan,
what I'm seeing here is a pattern.

919
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,960
A pattern of failure to
discharge your responsibilities

920
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:25,960
as a senior detective.

921
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,960
You should have been
chasing up that postmortem!

922
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,960
No, you are absolutely right, sir.

923
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:34,940
And what's worse is Kate had made a
specific point of asking me and all.

924
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,960
I was beside myself when I realised

925
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,800
and I apologise unreservedly for my error.

926
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,960
But you see, DI Cottan...

927
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,960
it raises the distinct possibility
that you were somehow reluctant

928
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:50,940
to seek confirmation that
Kennedy WASN'T a suicide.

929
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,960
That he was in fact murdered.

930
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,960
I was very pleased with
that information, sir,

931
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,960
as it was instrumental
in our arrest of Bains.

932
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,340
For which I won a commendation.

933
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,940
Let's just stay with
Hari Bains for a second.

934
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,960
He levelled some very disturbing
allegations against you,

935
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,960
DI Cottan, wouldn't you agree?

936
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:13,000
Which I strenuously deny. And for
which there is zero evidence.

937
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,940
Yeah, well...

938
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:21,400
we carried out a search of
your service vehicle. What?

939
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,960
Now, I am doing very well to
avoid blowing my top here.

940
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,940
This is out of order.

941
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,960
And as you well know, completely illegal

942
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,960
under the Police and
Criminal Evidence Act 1984,

943
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,960
as DI Cottan is neither under
arrest nor charged with an offence.

944
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,960
Yes, well, said illegality
would only apply

945
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,960
if it was DI Cottan's personal vehicle.

946
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,960
His service vehicle is owned by the police

947
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,960
and as such we are entitled to search it

948
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,960
without any form of authority.

949
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:46,960
Still, in my view,

950
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,960
we have reached the point
where either you stop

951
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,079
or you caution my client.

952
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,199
DI Cottan, stay right there.

953
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,960
You do not have to say anything, however,

954
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,960
it may harm your defence if
you fail to mention something,

955
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:14,940
under questioning, that you
later go on to rely on in court.

956
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Of course, anything you do say may
be used in evidence. Thank you.

957
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,960
Now, what the hell are you
doing searching my car?

958
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:32,940
This is a signed authority from
Superintendent Summers of AC-3

959
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:40,000
to investigate AC-12 officers, based
on concerns raised by DC Fleming.

960
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,940
OK.

961
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Just doing our job here,
there is nothing personal.

962
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,960
OK, it was obviously
investigating Steven Arnott.

963
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:54,960
Not me.

964
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,960
The signed authority from
Superintendent Summers

965
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,940
is a bit like Grandma's nightgown.

966
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,940
It covers everything.

967
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,960
DC Fleming, the search of
DI Cottan's service vehicle,

968
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:06,960
if you please.

969
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,940
Sir.

970
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:12,940
Service vehicle November Juliet
Zero Seven Zulu Foxtrot Whisky

971
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:16,940
was examined forensically,
with one notable finding.

972
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,940
Item GBS-8 is a number
of synthetic fibres.

973
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:24,940
Comparison of fibres from
GBS-8 and NTW-7 finds multiple

974
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:28,940
chemical correlations that
imply a very strong likelihood

975
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,960
the materials derive from
the same original source.

976
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:35,000
The same original source.

977
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,960
NTW-7 is the item reference
assigned to the rope

978
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:42,940
found at the industrial unit
where Hari Bains was arrested.

979
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,400
The noose had been in your boot.

980
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:51,000
The noose that you claimed Hari
Bains was going to hang you with.

981
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:56,940
What the forensics are suggesting
is that you planted it there

982
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,960
in that industrial unit

983
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:02,199
to falsely incriminate
Bains for Kennedy's murder!

984
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,960
Bains had handled the rope
when he prepared the noose.

985
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,960
Bains and I had a scuffle in which
he attempted to overpower me.

986
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,960
Fibres transferred onto me.

987
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,960
Those fibres were then transferred
into my service vehicle

988
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,960
the next morning when I clocked on.

989
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,940
They were in the boot -- nowhere else.

990
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,960
The first thing I do before I get
in the motor is sling my coat

991
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,960
and briefcase in the boot.

992
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,960
Now, if those fibres were
going to end up anywhere,

993
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,800
that is exactly where they would be found.

994
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,940
Are you covering...

995
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:43,940
for the real murderer of Rod Kennedy?

996
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,539
No, I'm not.

997
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:50,000
Were you involved in murdering
Rod Kennedy? No, I wasn't.

998
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,880
Returning to the mobile
phones... Happy to.

999
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,940
On screen, image 104.

1000
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,940
Image 104 shows item reference KMF-13,

1001
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,960
an unregistered mobile phone,

1002
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:16,000
and item reference KMF-14 is a
subscriber identification module.

1003
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,280
Do you recognise these items?

1004
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:22,960
No.

1005
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,960
No? I'll give you "no".

1006
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,960
These items were submitted
to us in evidence by a witness

1007
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,960
who alleges that they
do or did belong to you.

1008
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:32,960
Well, then, the witness is mistaken.

1009
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:36,940
Analysis of said subscriber
identification module KMF-14

1010
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:41,940
revealed no activity since October 2014.

1011
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,960
All communications up to
and including that date

1012
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,940
appear to relate to
other unregistered users.

1013
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:50,940
Right, so you have got a phone
that doesn't belong to me

1014
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,960
and a load of mysterious calls.

1015
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,940
Pardon me if I don't see the significance.

1016
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
On screen, image 909.

1017
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,940
Image 909 is item reference SJP-32.

1018
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,940
It was detected in the boot of a vehicle

1019
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,960
found at the Edge Park Golf Club

1020
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,940
in July of 2012.

1021
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,940
The vehicle is registered
to Alex Campbell --

1022
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:15,940
the alias being used at the
time by one John Thomas Hunter.

1023
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,960
Now, it was known Tommy Hunter
used numerous such phones

1024
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,940
to conduct his criminal activities.

1025
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,960
But this particular phone
is of interest to us

1026
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:29,940
because of a call made on the 8th
of July 2012 at around midnight.

1027
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,940
It was from Hunter's phone to yours.

1028
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,960
And that's the significance, fella.

1029
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,940
In black and white.

1030
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,960
I have no connection with this phone
or SIM Card you have been given.

1031
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,940
And I've certainly no
connection to Hunter.

1032
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:47,000
So how come we are being told
this phone belongs to you?

1033
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,940
This witness you've got, I bet he said

1034
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:55,000
he found this phone in my service
vehicle a couple of years back.

1035
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,960
Well, I can neither confirm nor deny...

1036
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:58,960
Yeah, well, I CAN confirm that

1037
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:02,940
he's sat on this so-called
evidence for a long time.

1038
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,960
I reckon he also told you
he conned me into taking

1039
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,960
the wrong SIM Card back while
he held on to the real McCoy.

1040
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,960
Yeah, well, as I said, I can
neither confirm nor deny.

1041
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Is there anything you've got
linking me to these items? Mm?

1042
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,400
Something like forensic evidence?

1043
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,940
I did leave my phone
in my service vehicle.

1044
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,960
And I was very grateful when DC Morton --

1045
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:29,940
and let's not be coy about
names -- returned it to me.

1046
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,960
Now, I have no idea where this
other SIM Card has come from.

1047
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,960
But DC Morton informed us
that it was you who induced him

1048
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,960
to mislead the original
inquiry about The Caddy,

1049
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:41,940
that it was you, DI Cottan,
who suggested attributing

1050
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,940
the nickname to a deceased police officer.

1051
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,960
Well, that's just not true, sir.

1052
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,940
It was DC Morton who did the misleading.

1053
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:53,940
He is the one that has been falsely
claiming disability benefits.

1054
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,960
He will say anything to cling on
to his pension. Anything at all.

1055
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:00,000
The man is a completely
unreliable witness.

1056
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:09,000
DI Cottan, where were you
on the morning of July 17th?

1057
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,960
You're asking me where I was
when Lindsay Denton was murdered?

1058
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:14,960
100% that's what she's asking you.

1059
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,960
You need to demonstrate some
legal basis for that question

1060
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:21,000
or I suggest you withdraw it immediately.

1061
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,739
Kate, bring up the next item and the map.

1062
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,939
Item reference MB-1 to MB-5,

1063
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,960
traffic cameras captured
images of this vehicle

1064
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,960
on the morning of Lindsay's murder.

1065
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,960
Identical make, model and
colour as Steve Arnott's

1066
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,399
but with different registration.

1067
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:45,939
It was driven on the route matching
Lindsay's location that morning.

1068
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,960
The registration proved to be false.

1069
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,960
We are curious about the logic here.

1070
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,939
The logic?

1071
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,960
Steve Arnott takes the
trouble to disguise a vehicle,

1072
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,960
but there were no fake plates found
when Lindsay's body was discovered.

1073
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,960
I mean, why would Steve
remove the fake plates...

1074
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,960
and then leave Lindsay's body
lying in the front passenger seat

1075
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,140
for all the world to find?

1076
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:11,939
My hypothesis would be Steven Arnott
only meant to abduct Lindsay Denton.

1077
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:15,000
Something went wrong, he
killed her, he panicked.

1078
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,960
Would Lindsay really
have got into Steve's car

1079
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,939
if she'd seen it was
displaying fake plates?

1080
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
Everyone makes mistakes.

1081
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
Indeed we do, DI Cottan.

1082
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,960
Are there any witnesses that saw

1083
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,939
Steve's car being stolen, as he claimed?

1084
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:40,000
Mm? Any witnesses that saw
anyone else driving the vehicle?

1085
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:46,000
I think these are questions
for Steven Arnott, not me.

1086
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:49,960
DC Fleming.

1087
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,939
Steve Arnott insists
he returned his firearm

1088
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,960
four days before Lindsay's murder.

1089
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,960
The booking-out officer
at South Ferry armoury

1090
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:58,960
corroborates Steve's story.

1091
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,960
The booking-out officer
is covering his own arse.

1092
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,960
Yeah, well, an impostor could
have obtained the murder weapon

1093
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,960
and then forged the paperwork
to make it appear that

1094
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,960
Steve Arnott's firearm had the same
serial number as the murder weapon

1095
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:10,960
and that he never returned it.

1096
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:14,939
That's an interesting theory.
But it couldn't have been me.

1097
01:10:14,979 --> 01:10:15,960
I am not an AFO.

1098
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,939
How would I have obtained
the murder weapon?

1099
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,960
The Caddy commands a
network of corrupt officers.

1100
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:23,340
He does.

1101
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,939
But Steve Arnott's The Caddy, not me.

1102
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,960
You have thought that since
before Lindsay's murder. Yeah.

1103
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:35,939
Yeah, in fact, you made a call to me
the night before Lindsay's murder.

1104
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,960
You called me after you had
observed Lindsay Denton

1105
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,399
return to her approved premises.

1106
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,939
Yeah. At 15 minutes after midnight,

1107
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,960
you called me from your
mobile and you said,

1108
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,960
"That lead on Steve looks
like it's going to pan out,

1109
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:51,939
"he really did plant the
money at Lindsay's. Sorry.

1110
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:55,939
"I thought you would want to know
before it becomes common knowledge."

1111
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,479
Did you make that call, DI Cottan?

1112
01:10:58,960 --> 01:10:59,960
I...

1113
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,960
Yeah. Yeah, so what was that
lead that was going to pan out?

1114
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
Erm...

1115
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,960
Well, it couldn't have been
the money in Steve's gym bag,

1116
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,960
because that wasn't discovered
until the forensics carried out

1117
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:16,000
a search in the service
vehicle the next day.

1118
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,960
Arnott was behaving suspiciously
and I wanted to give Kate

1119
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,960
a heads up, as they had been
partners for a long time.

1120
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,960
Oh, that's very considerate of you,

1121
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:30,000
but I will ask you for a second
time -- what was the lead?

1122
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:34,279
Erm...

1123
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,960
.. I had glimpsed some
banknotes in his gym bag,

1124
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:40,960
I intended to investigate.

1125
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:44,100
When did you see the
banknotes? Earlier that day.

1126
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,960
But how could you have known
that forensics would connect them

1127
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,479
to the money planted at Lindsay's?

1128
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,199
Eh...

1129
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,939
DI Cottan, were you able to forewarn Kate

1130
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,960
because you had a scheme in mind
where you were going to plant

1131
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:07,960
that money in Steve's service vehicle?

1132
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,960
No. No, absolutely not.

1133
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,800
That's how the service vehicle was stolen.

1134
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,939
You cloned the key

1135
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,960
and were plotting to use it to
plant evidence against Steve. No.

1136
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,939
No, absolutely not.

1137
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:25,939
DI Cottan, I think we have earned
the right to ask you the question --

1138
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,939
will you kindly tell us your whereabouts

1139
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:32,000
between 10 and 11 that morning?

1140
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:37,199
Well, I really don't have
to answer that question.

1141
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,939
Don't you?

1142
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,960
This is a voluntary interview,
and I am only cooperating out of

1143
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:46,939
my lawful duty as a police officer
to assist in a criminal inquiry.

1144
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:48,960
Indeed you are, indeed you are,

1145
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,960
and we can call a halt to
the proceedings right there

1146
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:54,939
and leave this question hanging
over you and your career --

1147
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,960
or you can stick your hand
up and offer us an answer

1148
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,960
and exclude yourself from our inquiries.

1149
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,960
Entirely your decision.

1150
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,680
Take your time.

1151
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,939
I was at my flat.

1152
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,939
I had had a late night on surveillance

1153
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,960
and I needed to catch up on some kip.

1154
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:28,000
So you were in during
those hours? Yep. Yep.

1155
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,680
Say that again.

1156
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:38,000
You just said you were in your
flat, we have that on tape.

1157
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,199
Eh...

1158
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,939
It's a very simple matter, DI Cottan.

1159
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,960
DI Cottan has answered,
haven't you, DI Cottan?

1160
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,960
You have mentioned, when
questioned, something

1161
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,600
you later intend to rely on in court.

1162
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:06,000
Yeah, look, I... Sorry. I
may have got that wrong.

1163
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:10,000
Eh, I just need to... think. Erm...

1164
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,939
I-I'd been up late and...

1165
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,340
Take your time, take your time.

1166
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:28,000
I, eh, I need to think about
that one. Absolutely, absolutely.

1167
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:36,000
Maybe I could just... Yeah...
check my calendar... Yeah, yeah.

1168
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:43,000
You wouldn't have entered
my flat, would you, Kate?

1169
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
I mean, alone.

1170
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,939
Tend to this wounded man here, quick!

1171
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,939
Kate! You all right?

1172
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:20,000
Someone start CPR. I want
this building locked down!

1173
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
Open the door!

1174
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:28,939
Don't move!

1175
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:33,000
Give me your Glock! There's a
pick-up point, it's all arranged!

1176
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:43,960
Get back! MOVE!

1177
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,079
Stop! Stop, armed police!

1178
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,539
Keep driving as fast as you can. OK.

1179
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:07,000
It looks like they're going
to go left, go with them.

1180
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
Keep up with them.

1181
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
Keep going, keep going.

1182
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
Right, drive on.

1183
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:47,000
Two males, one armed...

1184
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:54,939
Kate? Suspects heading north
off Kingsgate High Street!

1185
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,399
North off Kingsgate High Street!

1186
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,960
Kate, listen to me, retain visual
contact but do not approach.

1187
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:05,939
We have an armed response unit on
the way. Repeat, do not approach.

1188
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:07,199
Sir.

1189
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:42,539
Armed police!

1190
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,279
Drop your weapon! Drop yours!

1191
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:02,939
Kate, sitrep.

1192
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,939
One suspect down. Repeat,
one suspect down.

1193
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,960
Second suspect heading
to Moss Heath flyover.

1194
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
Moss Heath flyover.

1195
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,960
OK, so which one of them
is still up and running?

1196
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:16,939
Dot.

1197
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,939
What can I do to help, sir? Good girl.

1198
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:21,960
Get on to the SFC. I need to know where

1199
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,340
those armed response units are!

1200
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,279
Strategic Firearms Commander.

1201
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,340
Drop your gun, drop your phone!

1202
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,680
Kate... Drop 'em, hands over your head!

1203
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:10,000
They're not here for you, then?
Not yet. But they will be.

1204
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,960
My advice? Run now while you can.

1205
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,960
I'm too knackered to run. Drop the gun!

1206
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,960
You went into my flat that morning,
you saw I wasn't there? Maybe.

1207
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:28,000
Maybe not. When did you know?

1208
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:34,000
That'd be telling. Well, now I
see why we never slept together.

1209
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,399
It wasn't that I didn't want to.

1210
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,960
Please, go now, while it's safe.

1211
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,960
I get it -- Steve Arnott's
The Caddy so you can retire?

1212
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:46,960
Yeah, something like that, yeah.

1213
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:50,939
They picked you, groomed
you, guided your career.

1214
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
You know everything.

1215
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,939
What are you going to do now, just stop?

1216
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,600
What do you think they're going to do?

1217
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,960
There's only one way you
can put this behind you.

1218
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,960
Kate, I know what I'm
doing. Patrick Fairbank.

1219
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:11,939
They're saying he's going to
get off the child abuse charges.

1220
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:15,000
You know names, dates, places.

1221
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:19,000
You know all about monsters like him.

1222
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
Confess.

1223
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,960
Give us the names of all
the people that have ruined

1224
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:26,960
all these people's lives!

1225
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:30,000
All these monsters you've protected!

1226
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:35,939
Do the right thing. Confess!

1227
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
Tell us everything.

1228
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:40,960
Agh!

1229
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:50,279
Go! Go!

1230
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,960
PC Bindra, AC-12, I am still
awaiting the requested information.

1231
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:36,939
Be on, everybody, one of our
own is out there in harm's way!

1232
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:38,960
I need to know what's going on!

1233
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:40,960
Our officer is at Moss Heath flyover,

1234
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,939
we need a location on
those armed units, sir.

1235
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:42,000
We need an ambulance!
Armed police, get back!

1236
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:44,399
Get back!

1237
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,939
Dot, drop the gun.

1238
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,539
Put it down.

1239
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:11,140
No!

1240
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,960
Armed police, drop your
weapon, on the ground!

1241
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:22,939
I'm AC-12. Everyone back! AC-12.

1242
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:24,960
Everyone, get back, now!

1243
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,279
'.. urgent paramedic support.'

1244
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:32,939
Get away from him!

1245
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:37,000
I'm taking his dying declaration.
Sergeant, you will stand down!

1246
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:43,000
Come on, Dot, say it.

1247
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:47,680
(Come on, Dot.)

1248
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,800
You're free to go.

1249
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
Kate?

1250
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
Who else would it be?

1251
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
Thanks, mate.

1252
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,199
Come on, let's get you home.

1253
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,960
Congratulations, Kate.
Thank you. Very well done.

1254
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
Thanks.

1255
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,939
Look how far we've come.

1256
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:38,939
It's a family united.

1257
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,939
The Russians have made contact.

1258
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:43,960
They are very dangerous people.

1259
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
So are we.

1259
01:27:47,305 --> 01:28:47,558
