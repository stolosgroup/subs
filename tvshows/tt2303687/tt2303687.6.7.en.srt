1
00:00:07,533 --> 00:00:10,389
My mum was Tommy's sister.

2
00:00:10,413 --> 00:00:14,864
My dad was... bent,
a police officer.

3
00:00:14,888 --> 00:00:19,280
By the time of our inquiry in 2015,
Thurwell had taken early retirement,

4
00:00:19,304 --> 00:00:23,760
believed to be living in Spain.

5
00:00:23,784 --> 00:00:31,784
Two dead, Sir.
Marcus Thurwell, Senora Thurwell.

6
00:00:33,128 --> 00:00:35,792
You want to talk about
rats? Ask your boss.

7
00:00:35,816 --> 00:00:36,944
Superintendent Hastings?

8
00:00:36,968 --> 00:00:39,189
He told me was there
was a rat in our crew.

9
00:00:39,213 --> 00:00:42,549
And that rat turned out
to be an undercover copper...

10
00:00:42,573 --> 00:00:46,544
John Corbett.

11
00:00:46,568 --> 00:00:48,669
I think I've found the
real reason the gaffer gave

12
00:00:48,693 --> 00:00:54,480
50 grand to Steph Corbett.

13
00:00:54,504 --> 00:00:56,912
Superintendent Hastings
has been informed of his

14
00:00:56,936 --> 00:01:01,200
impending retirement.

15
00:01:01,224 --> 00:01:03,952
We have identified a number
of high-ranking figures

16
00:01:03,976 --> 00:01:06,669
in a clandestine network
of corrupt police officers.

17
00:01:06,693 --> 00:01:11,709
This Force has detected no evidence
of institutionalised corruption.

18
00:01:11,733 --> 00:01:15,344
We are so close to breaking
open Operation Lighthouse

19
00:01:15,368 --> 00:01:20,592
and OCG involvement
in Gail Vella's murder!

20
00:01:20,616 --> 00:01:23,109
The case Gail Vella was
researching at the time of her death

21
00:01:23,133 --> 00:01:25,072
was the murder of
Lawrence Christopher.

22
00:01:25,096 --> 00:01:27,789
That was, what, 20 years ago?

23
00:01:27,813 --> 00:01:30,576
I've been looking into all the
officers that were involved

24
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,880
in the Lawrence Christopher
murder inquiry.

25
00:01:32,904 --> 00:01:36,464
Detective Constable Ian Buckells.

26
00:01:36,488 --> 00:01:43,389
Inspector Philip Osborne.

27
00:01:43,413 --> 00:01:50,352
Sorry, wrong way.

28
00:01:50,376 --> 00:01:53,360
Not only does this
force face enemies without,

29
00:01:53,384 --> 00:01:55,792
there are enemies within.

30
00:01:55,816 --> 00:01:59,504
I will personally see to
it those enemies within

31
00:01:59,528 --> 00:02:05,264
are made to suffer the consequences.

32
00:02:05,288 --> 00:02:07,389
And later that same day
you visited Lee Banks,

33
00:02:07,413 --> 00:02:09,680
an OCG member on remand
in Blackthorn Prison.

34
00:02:09,704 --> 00:02:11,856
Yeah, to harvest
information on the OCG.

35
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,109
When DS Arnott quite rightly
did not deploy lethal force

36
00:02:14,133 --> 00:02:16,749
against John Corbett, did you
take matters into your own hands

37
00:02:16,773 --> 00:02:19,152
and disclose to
Lee Banks that John Corbett

38
00:02:19,176 --> 00:02:21,789
was an undercover police
officer? No, I did not.

39
00:02:21,813 --> 00:02:24,016
Disclosing this
information with the expectation

40
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:31,760
that it would be
passed on to the OCG? No!

41
00:02:31,784 --> 00:02:34,000
The stuff he's hiding...

42
00:02:34,024 --> 00:02:35,984
I never thought I'd look
at the gaffer like this.

43
00:02:36,008 --> 00:02:38,032
He knows his time's nearly up.

44
00:02:38,056 --> 00:02:41,109
He's been slated for retirement.

45
00:02:41,133 --> 00:02:42,640
Shit.

46
00:02:42,664 --> 00:02:44,709
I've been waiting for the
right time to tell you,

47
00:02:44,733 --> 00:02:47,504
maybe we should let
sleeping dogs lie.

48
00:02:47,528 --> 00:02:49,040
Come off it, Steve.

49
00:02:49,064 --> 00:02:51,856
How many times have we criticised
coppers that've took retirement

50
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:56,469
to dodge disciplinary action?

51
00:02:56,493 --> 00:02:58,512
You got anything
more from Steph Corbett?

52
00:02:58,536 --> 00:02:59,792
No. I think about asking her.

53
00:02:59,816 --> 00:03:02,296
I mean, she's got a right to
know what happened to her husband.

54
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,080
Maybe she already does.

55
00:03:04,104 --> 00:03:07,629
She might be blackmailing
the gaffer. Steph? No.

56
00:03:07,653 --> 00:03:11,888
You seem pretty sure.

57
00:03:11,912 --> 00:03:14,064
What?

58
00:03:14,088 --> 00:03:16,432
We've become...
Oh, for Christ sake, Steve.

59
00:03:16,456 --> 00:03:18,800
No. It's not like that,
mate, it's different.

60
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:21,552
She's a person of interest.

61
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:24,560
Chris.

62
00:03:24,584 --> 00:03:31,389
Yeah. We'll be right there.

63
00:03:31,413 --> 00:03:34,096
GPR detected a strong
subsurface diffractor,

64
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,144
and I gave a go-ahead for a dig

65
00:03:36,168 --> 00:03:38,256
which revealed a strong
box of the type detected

66
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,432
at the abandoned print shop.

67
00:03:40,456 --> 00:03:43,056
Nice one, Chris. Thanks, Ma'am.

68
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,189
Let's get EOD to
rule out booby traps,

69
00:03:45,213 --> 00:03:47,109
then proceed to forensic recovery.

70
00:03:47,133 --> 00:03:48,909
Sir.

71
00:03:48,933 --> 00:03:56,933
Let's find out what's in there.

72
00:04:01,832 --> 00:04:03,792
All right if I call you Steve?

73
00:04:03,816 --> 00:04:06,429
Fine.

74
00:04:06,453 --> 00:04:09,069
It's taken a while to
organise this consultation.

75
00:04:09,093 --> 00:04:11,472
Are you able to tell me
why that might be, Steve?

76
00:04:11,496 --> 00:04:16,592
Just work, sorry.

77
00:04:16,616 --> 00:04:19,989
In the medical declaration
form that you submitted

78
00:04:20,013 --> 00:04:21,840
at the time of your urine sampling,

79
00:04:21,864 --> 00:04:25,509
you listed a number of
over-the-counter painkillers.

80
00:04:25,533 --> 00:04:27,344
For what condition?

81
00:04:27,368 --> 00:04:28,989
Hurt my knee at five-a-side.

82
00:04:29,013 --> 00:04:31,149
My shoulder was squash.

83
00:04:31,173 --> 00:04:35,280
SMTU detected levels of
metabolites in your urine

84
00:04:35,304 --> 00:04:43,304
consistent with the ingestion of
very high doses of analgesics.

85
00:04:44,904 --> 00:04:49,680
In April, 2017, you suffered a
serious assault whilst on duty.

86
00:04:49,704 --> 00:04:57,704
I'm fully recovered.

87
00:05:00,648 --> 00:05:03,568
Recently you've been involved
in an operation in which

88
00:05:03,592 --> 00:05:06,704
a number of suspects
have been killed.

89
00:05:06,728 --> 00:05:10,672
One having been shot dead by you,
and one of your colleagues,

90
00:05:10,696 --> 00:05:15,669
PS Ruby Jones, lost her life.

91
00:05:15,693 --> 00:05:19,509
Yeah.

92
00:05:19,533 --> 00:05:21,552
That's not the first
time you've witnessed

93
00:05:21,576 --> 00:05:23,949
a colleague's violent death.

94
00:05:23,973 --> 00:05:28,272
DCI Tony Gates was killed
in a road traffic collision.

95
00:05:28,296 --> 00:05:31,029
DC Georgia Trotman, your partner,
was thrown from a window...

96
00:05:31,053 --> 00:05:32,949
Where are you going with this?

97
00:05:32,973 --> 00:05:36,592
Steve, I'm satisfied that
none of the substances

98
00:05:36,616 --> 00:05:38,960
you've been taking are illegal.

99
00:05:38,984 --> 00:05:41,520
This is purely about your welfare.

100
00:05:41,544 --> 00:05:44,912
I'm here to help, not judge.

101
00:05:44,936 --> 00:05:47,152
You might benefit
from some time off work.

102
00:05:47,176 --> 00:05:48,789
No.

103
00:05:48,813 --> 00:05:53,469
No way. I'm in the
middle of a massive case.

104
00:05:53,493 --> 00:05:55,664
Do your duties routinely
involve firearms

105
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:59,760
or high-speed pursuit driving?

106
00:05:59,784 --> 00:06:01,552
Sometimes.

107
00:06:01,576 --> 00:06:04,432
Normally in this situation,
we suggest that the officer

108
00:06:04,456 --> 00:06:07,509
voluntarily surrenders
their blue ticket.

109
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:11,349
Otherwise I'm obliged to report
you to the Head of Firearms

110
00:06:11,373 --> 00:06:17,232
who will then remove
your firearms license.

111
00:06:17,256 --> 00:06:19,869
OK.

112
00:06:19,893 --> 00:06:21,712
Thank you.

113
00:06:21,736 --> 00:06:23,952
So I'd like you to have
some medical investigations

114
00:06:23,976 --> 00:06:26,109
and then review
you with the results.

115
00:06:26,133 --> 00:06:28,149
Can we agree on that?

116
00:06:28,173 --> 00:06:30,032
Fine.

117
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:36,752
I'm also obliged to inform
your commanding officer.

118
00:06:36,776 --> 00:06:42,832
Yeah.

119
00:06:42,856 --> 00:06:47,952
Steve.

120
00:06:47,976 --> 00:06:51,024
I want you to hear it
from me first, Sir.

121
00:06:51,048 --> 00:06:52,880
I'm under medical review.

122
00:06:52,904 --> 00:06:57,872
The drugs testing found
high doses of painkillers.

123
00:06:57,896 --> 00:06:59,229
Yeah, well,

124
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:03,760
I'm just glad you're
getting some help with it, son.

125
00:07:03,784 --> 00:07:11,248
If there's anything I
can do just let me know.

126
00:07:11,272 --> 00:07:14,512
Thank you very much, Sir.

127
00:07:14,536 --> 00:07:21,429
Yeah.

128
00:07:21,453 --> 00:07:23,920
Take your time, take your time.

129
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:28,912
You're doing well, Jo.

130
00:07:28,936 --> 00:07:33,392
So Tommy hid from you
he was your real father?

131
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:34,629
Yes.

132
00:07:34,653 --> 00:07:39,600
Who did you believe was your father?

133
00:07:39,624 --> 00:07:45,576
This person, did he control you
the same way Tommy Hunter did?

134
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:56,333
This person, did he control you
the same way Tommy Hunter did?

135
00:07:59,976 --> 00:08:03,309
PHONE: You have one new message.

136
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:05,349
Steve, it's Steph.

137
00:08:05,373 --> 00:08:07,952
God, I hate these message thingies.

138
00:08:07,976 --> 00:08:10,320
It's just I ain't heard
from you in a while.

139
00:08:10,344 --> 00:08:14,829
I hope you're all right. Copper's
wife, me, I can't help but worry.

140
00:08:14,853 --> 00:08:22,853
That's it really, bye.

141
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,074
-== [ www.OpenSubtitles.com ] ==-

142
00:08:48,453 --> 00:08:51,792
Thanks, guys. Sarge. Sarge.

143
00:08:51,816 --> 00:08:54,909
So, the excavation
detected a strong box.

144
00:08:54,933 --> 00:08:58,389
The contents of the box
are itemised as follows.

145
00:08:58,413 --> 00:08:59,728
A KL-2.

146
00:08:59,752 --> 00:09:01,029
A non-standard pistol

147
00:09:01,053 --> 00:09:04,272
believed to have been workshopped
from a decommissioned firearm.

148
00:09:04,296 --> 00:09:06,640
NABIS have matched the pistol
to the tailored cartridge

149
00:09:06,664 --> 00:09:09,669
and bullet recovered from the
scene of Gail Vella's murder.

150
00:09:09,693 --> 00:09:12,912
Almost certainly this is the
weapon that fired the fatal shot.

151
00:09:12,936 --> 00:09:14,384
Fingerprints, DNA?

152
00:09:14,408 --> 00:09:15,728
No, it was clean.

153
00:09:15,752 --> 00:09:17,840
Almost certainly the
gunman was wearing gloves.

154
00:09:17,864 --> 00:09:22,640
KL-4, KL-5, gloves
and a black bomber jacket.

155
00:09:22,664 --> 00:09:25,904
Both items bear blood
spatter and gunshot residue.

156
00:09:25,928 --> 00:09:28,272
The blood is Gail Vella's.
DNA inside the gloves?

157
00:09:28,296 --> 00:09:29,360
Yes, ma'am.

158
00:09:29,384 --> 00:09:33,328
Sweat deposits inside the gloves
match DNA belonging to Carl Banks.

159
00:09:33,352 --> 00:09:35,504
Got the bastard. Yes, Sir.

160
00:09:35,528 --> 00:09:38,709
We can match Banks to the gloves and
the gloves to Gail Vella's murder.

161
00:09:38,733 --> 00:09:40,176
He's the shooter.

162
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,968
Any of it relate to Terry Boyle?

163
00:09:41,992 --> 00:09:43,632
No, Sir, nothing.

164
00:09:43,656 --> 00:09:46,896
Great. Next.

165
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,712
GN-1.

166
00:09:49,736 --> 00:09:52,749
I'm sorry to be the
bearer of distressing news.

167
00:09:52,773 --> 00:09:56,176
This knife is stained with
the blood of an AC-12 officer,

168
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:59,632
PC Maneet Bindra.

169
00:09:59,656 --> 00:10:02,512
Fingerprints on the handle...

170
00:10:02,536 --> 00:10:08,144
match Ryan Pilkington.

171
00:10:08,168 --> 00:10:09,744
GN-2.

172
00:10:09,768 --> 00:10:13,072
This knife is stained with
the blood of DS John Corbett.

173
00:10:13,096 --> 00:10:17,296
Fingerprints on the
handle match Ryan Pilkington.

174
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,789
GN-3.

175
00:10:18,813 --> 00:10:21,520
This knife is stained with
the blood of Jackie Laverty.

176
00:10:21,544 --> 00:10:24,208
Fingerprints on the handle
match a deceased police officer,

177
00:10:24,232 --> 00:10:26,256
DCI Tony Gates.

178
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,752
Gates told me the OCG
slit Jackie's throat,

179
00:10:28,776 --> 00:10:31,312
and while he was incapacitated,
they put his hand on the knife.

180
00:10:31,336 --> 00:10:34,000
They blackmailed him with the
threat of releasing Jackie's body

181
00:10:34,024 --> 00:10:35,229
and the murder weapon.

182
00:10:35,253 --> 00:10:37,029
That's why all these
items were retained.

183
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:38,672
They're leverage, going back years,

184
00:10:38,696 --> 00:10:41,296
right up to it being a
threat to Ryan Pilkington.

185
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,512
Anything else?

186
00:10:42,536 --> 00:10:46,992
Any items relating to one or more
of the following, Marcus Thurwell,

187
00:10:47,016 --> 00:10:48,400
Ian Buckells?

188
00:10:48,424 --> 00:10:51,344
No, nothing.

189
00:10:51,368 --> 00:10:53,949
Philip Osborne?

190
00:10:53,973 --> 00:10:57,104
The Chief Constable?

191
00:10:57,128 --> 00:11:05,128
What?

192
00:11:10,533 --> 00:11:12,720
Great work, you two, great work.

193
00:11:12,744 --> 00:11:16,176
Cast-iron proof that
Carl Banks murdered Gail Vella.

194
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,672
I've got a call later
with the Crown Prosecutor.

195
00:11:18,696 --> 00:11:20,016
I'm sure we can persuade them

196
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,960
to withdraw proceedings
against Terry Boyle.

197
00:11:22,984 --> 00:11:25,584
Great. Well, that's the least
we can do for the wee fella.

198
00:11:25,608 --> 00:11:27,669
Any updates from Spain?

199
00:11:27,693 --> 00:11:30,448
They formally identified
the bodies found at the villa.

200
00:11:30,472 --> 00:11:32,432
They are Marcus Thurwell
and his wife.

201
00:11:32,456 --> 00:11:34,896
Both had been strangled, and
from the extent of decomposition,

202
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,789
they'd been dead a few weeks.

203
00:11:36,813 --> 00:11:39,600
A search of the property detected
equipment used for routeing

204
00:11:39,624 --> 00:11:42,096
digital communications
with an IP address

205
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,229
matching the ones
detected on devices

206
00:11:44,253 --> 00:11:47,152
belonging to
Jo Davidson and Lisa McQueen.

207
00:11:47,176 --> 00:11:49,749
From the evidence gathered
by Spanish authorities,

208
00:11:49,773 --> 00:11:53,360
Cybercrime are still trying to
trace all end-user IP addresses,

209
00:11:53,384 --> 00:11:57,072
but initial work suggests
they're located in the UK.

210
00:11:57,096 --> 00:12:00,912
So the communication
originated here? Exactly.

211
00:12:00,936 --> 00:12:03,152
So, Spain is a decoy.

212
00:12:03,176 --> 00:12:06,189
Thurwell's a stooge!

213
00:12:06,213 --> 00:12:08,144
Jesus.

214
00:12:08,168 --> 00:12:10,192
Have you seen
Superintendent Hastings?

215
00:12:10,216 --> 00:12:18,216
Yes, he's just
through there. Sir. Huh?

216
00:12:20,013 --> 00:12:21,840
Sorry to barge in.
What have you got?

217
00:12:21,864 --> 00:12:23,829
I knew you'd want to
see this straight away.

218
00:12:23,853 --> 00:12:26,192
We've been monitoring
messages being routed via Spain.

219
00:12:26,216 --> 00:12:27,920
This is a screen
shot of a text exchange

220
00:12:27,944 --> 00:12:29,776
we intercepted a few minutes ago.

221
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,144
We're working on
identifying the IP addresses.

222
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:35,024
JD, Jo Davidson.

223
00:12:35,048 --> 00:12:38,352
BP, Brentiss Prison.

224
00:12:38,376 --> 00:12:40,528
I thought you put Davidson
on elevated monitoring?

225
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:43,088
Yeah, but we can't take the
chance that that's gonna work out.

226
00:12:43,112 --> 00:12:45,309
Look at the spelling
of "definitely".

227
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:46,800
This is the Fourth Man.

228
00:12:46,824 --> 00:12:49,680
Chloe, all these new
files have come in,

229
00:12:49,704 --> 00:12:51,920
Operation Lighthouse,
Lawrence Christopher,

230
00:12:51,944 --> 00:12:53,864
I want you to carry out
a search on this spelling

231
00:12:53,888 --> 00:12:57,189
against anybody that we
haven't previously investigated.

232
00:12:57,213 --> 00:13:05,213
But good work.
Steve, Kate, with me. Sir.

233
00:13:11,336 --> 00:13:16,880
Stand away from the door.

234
00:13:16,904 --> 00:13:18,480
Production Order.

235
00:13:18,504 --> 00:13:20,080
Post-charge interview.

236
00:13:20,104 --> 00:13:28,104
Hillside Lane.

237
00:13:55,944 --> 00:14:03,944
What's going on?

238
00:14:21,544 --> 00:14:26,256
Alpha Charlie one zero, en route to
Brentiss, standing by for a sit rep.

239
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,752
Alpha Charlie five two, copy.

240
00:14:28,776 --> 00:14:30,800
Zero State five to Brentiss prison.

241
00:14:30,824 --> 00:14:33,104
Stand by for active message.

242
00:14:33,128 --> 00:14:34,448
One zero, receiving.

243
00:14:34,472 --> 00:14:36,944
Five two, the Governor
at Brentiss has approved

244
00:14:36,968 --> 00:14:38,949
a Production Order for Davidson.

245
00:14:38,973 --> 00:14:44,469
She's State nine to Hillside Lane.

246
00:14:44,493 --> 00:14:46,032
Three seven, first I've heard of it.

247
00:14:46,056 --> 00:14:50,640
Who's the Requesting Officer?

248
00:14:50,664 --> 00:14:53,589
DS Lomax.

249
00:14:53,613 --> 00:14:59,280
And the Supporting Officer?

250
00:14:59,304 --> 00:15:03,824
That's you, Ma'am, DI Fleming.

251
00:15:03,848 --> 00:15:06,960
One zero, we are
diverting to the Hill.

252
00:15:06,984 --> 00:15:08,432
Four five, received.

253
00:15:08,456 --> 00:15:12,720
Driver, put your foot
flat to the floor.

254
00:15:12,744 --> 00:15:16,752
One zero, five two, acquire
information on Prison Transport

255
00:15:16,776 --> 00:15:19,989
and capture location as a
matter of extreme urgency.

256
00:15:20,013 --> 00:15:23,664
We need Air Ops and
Armed Support! Over.

257
00:15:23,688 --> 00:15:31,664
Five two, received.

258
00:15:31,688 --> 00:15:34,800
What's this interview about?
Who's the Requesting Officer?

259
00:15:34,824 --> 00:15:39,309
How should I know?
Our job's just to get you there.

260
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:41,469
Are there any new
developments in the inquiry?

261
00:15:41,493 --> 00:15:48,669
Stop with the earache.

262
00:15:48,693 --> 00:15:51,189
NPAS, seven five,
acquiring active obs

263
00:15:51,213 --> 00:15:53,872
on Prison Transport Vehicle,
white VW Crafter.

264
00:15:53,896 --> 00:15:57,392
VRN Bravo Papa six zero
Papa Tango Quebec.

265
00:15:57,416 --> 00:16:00,144
Suspect vehicle is traveling
south, Alpha three four.

266
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:05,072
Speed three zero, one mile to
Edge Park Circus underpass.

267
00:16:05,096 --> 00:16:08,144
Tango Oscar four two,
receiving NPAS seven five,

268
00:16:08,168 --> 00:16:11,349
Edge Park Circus, ETA
less than one minute.

269
00:16:11,373 --> 00:16:15,504
NPAS, seven five, suspect
vehicle entering Underpass.

270
00:16:15,528 --> 00:16:23,528
Tango Oscar four two. All ARV's
move in, intercept, intercept.

271
00:16:53,416 --> 00:17:01,416
Keys! Give us the keys!

272
00:17:02,253 --> 00:17:03,789
Armed police! Drop it.

273
00:17:03,813 --> 00:17:06,704
Taser, Taser!

274
00:17:06,728 --> 00:17:11,952
Drop it!

275
00:17:11,976 --> 00:17:14,536
Get out of the vehicle! Hands!
Show me your hands!

276
00:17:19,656 --> 00:17:22,989
Down, down!

277
00:17:23,013 --> 00:17:26,109
Hands above your head!
Hands above your head!

278
00:17:26,133 --> 00:17:27,952
Four five, scene secure.

279
00:17:27,976 --> 00:17:29,589
Unarmed, clear to approach.

280
00:17:29,613 --> 00:17:31,629
Paramedic required.

281
00:17:31,653 --> 00:17:34,480
Four five, received.
Paramedic unit will move forwards,

282
00:17:34,504 --> 00:17:36,912
ETA 30 seconds, standing by for...

283
00:17:36,936 --> 00:17:44,936
Arrest her. Stick her in the
back with her wee mate. Sir.

284
00:17:46,664 --> 00:17:50,376
Great work, you two,
great work. Sir.

285
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:56,752
The prison officers and driver
have been taken into custody.

286
00:17:56,776 --> 00:17:59,229
We've recently gained access
to illicit communications

287
00:17:59,253 --> 00:18:01,296
between OCG members.

288
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:04,304
Fortunately, we were able to
intercept your Prison Transport

289
00:18:04,328 --> 00:18:06,160
and replace two of
the prison officers

290
00:18:06,184 --> 00:18:08,400
before the OCG got
their hands on you.

291
00:18:08,424 --> 00:18:10,000
The Production Order was a forgery.

292
00:18:10,024 --> 00:18:11,829
Now, we're looking into
how that was done,

293
00:18:11,853 --> 00:18:14,109
enabling corrupt prison
officers to stage a handover

294
00:18:14,133 --> 00:18:15,909
they could claim
afterwards was an ambush.

295
00:18:15,933 --> 00:18:18,384
They're all under arrest.

296
00:18:18,408 --> 00:18:22,629
You're safe now, Jo.

297
00:18:22,653 --> 00:18:24,208
Thank you.

298
00:18:24,232 --> 00:18:26,832
I mean you're really safe...

299
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:29,109
to apply for Witness Protection.

300
00:18:29,133 --> 00:18:32,229
All my notes, all my records
will show that you acted

301
00:18:32,253 --> 00:18:35,472
under control and
coercion of others.

302
00:18:35,496 --> 00:18:37,328
You can live the life
you should've lived,

303
00:18:37,352 --> 00:18:40,080
be free to be the
person that you really are...

304
00:18:40,104 --> 00:18:48,104
if you tell us who the top man is.

305
00:18:49,293 --> 00:18:51,088
We know from the
illicit communications

306
00:18:51,112 --> 00:18:53,840
you were taken out of
Brentiss to be killed.

307
00:18:53,864 --> 00:18:56,144
We strongly believe the
order came from the same person

308
00:18:56,168 --> 00:19:00,189
who's been communicating with you
throughout Operation Lighthouse.

309
00:19:00,213 --> 00:19:02,992
This person you're protecting
doesn't care for you.

310
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:05,872
You mean nothing to him.

311
00:19:05,896 --> 00:19:13,808
This man you believed to be
your father, is he the one?

312
00:19:13,832 --> 00:19:20,080
Tommy told me after my mum died...

313
00:19:20,104 --> 00:19:24,752
I had no reason to doubt him.

314
00:19:24,776 --> 00:19:31,389
He made me obey this police officer.

315
00:19:31,413 --> 00:19:34,288
He made me fear him.

316
00:19:34,312 --> 00:19:35,888
Yeah.

317
00:19:35,912 --> 00:19:39,600
It was all a cruel
lie to manipulate you,

318
00:19:39,624 --> 00:19:41,349
to control you.

319
00:19:41,373 --> 00:19:43,632
You're not what you were born into.

320
00:19:43,656 --> 00:19:46,512
You're not bent.

321
00:19:46,536 --> 00:19:50,416
Be free of him, Jo. Give him up.

322
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:58,440
Give us his name.

323
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:16,912
Prison officers are
isolating the suspect.

324
00:20:16,936 --> 00:20:19,749
AFOs will secure the suspect.

325
00:20:19,773 --> 00:20:24,789
Advise when unarmed officers
are clear to proceed. TOGETHER: Sir.

326
00:20:24,813 --> 00:20:32,813
When cleared to proceed, FIs
will deploy to the suspect's cell.

327
00:20:59,048 --> 00:21:02,160
Sir? Nothing.
Not so much as a Post-it.

328
00:21:02,184 --> 00:21:10,184
Shit. Has he said anything yet?
Not yet, Sir. Let's go.

329
00:21:18,573 --> 00:21:21,616
Resuming interview,
Superintendent Hastings has joined.

330
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:26,229
You remain under caution.

331
00:21:26,253 --> 00:21:29,709
So where have you hidden it all?

332
00:21:29,733 --> 00:21:34,416
The computer, the burner phones.

333
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:38,064
I don't know what
you're talking about.

334
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:40,389
I get mixed up.

335
00:21:40,413 --> 00:21:43,509
You packed Thurwell off to Spain,
didn't you, to be your go-between?

336
00:21:43,533 --> 00:21:45,744
Images 76 and 77.

337
00:21:45,768 --> 00:21:47,472
Spain, what would I
have to do with Spain?

338
00:21:47,496 --> 00:21:50,800
Thurwell could point the finger,
so you had him killed,

339
00:21:50,824 --> 00:21:53,469
like Dot Cottan and
ACC Hilton, right?

340
00:21:53,493 --> 00:21:56,349
All these names, they, uh,
my heads spinning now.

341
00:21:56,373 --> 00:21:59,504
And Gail Vella.
Did you order her murder too?

342
00:21:59,528 --> 00:22:03,189
I haven't the faintest idea
who you're talking about!

343
00:22:03,213 --> 00:22:06,800
Joanne Davidson.
What's your relationship to her?

344
00:22:06,824 --> 00:22:08,848
Joanne who? Davidson!

345
00:22:08,872 --> 00:22:11,229
We know about her
relationship to Tommy Hunter

346
00:22:11,253 --> 00:22:13,520
and to a police officer
purported to be her father.

347
00:22:13,544 --> 00:22:15,568
Are you that officer?

348
00:22:15,592 --> 00:22:18,128
Did you have a relationship
with Joanne Davidson's mother,

349
00:22:18,152 --> 00:22:24,592
Samantha Davidson?

350
00:22:24,616 --> 00:22:27,984
For the DIR, I'm showing
the interviewee Image 17,

351
00:22:28,008 --> 00:22:30,864
a copy of a photograph
captured during a lawful search

352
00:22:30,888 --> 00:22:35,984
of Apartment G, 9 Croxford Street
on the 24th of November, 2020.

353
00:22:36,008 --> 00:22:43,792
Who can you see in Image 17?

354
00:22:43,816 --> 00:22:44,949
Sorry.

355
00:22:44,973 --> 00:22:46,800
The woman is Samantha Davidson,

356
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:48,912
also known as Samantha Hunter.

357
00:22:48,936 --> 00:22:51,088
Tommy Hunter's sister.

358
00:22:51,112 --> 00:22:53,589
And the girl in the photo?
I've not the foggiest!

359
00:22:53,613 --> 00:22:55,312
It's Joanne Davidson.

360
00:22:55,336 --> 00:22:56,592
Right, OK, let me ask you this.

361
00:22:56,616 --> 00:23:04,616
Did you and Tommy Hunter convince
her that you were her father?

362
00:23:12,104 --> 00:23:15,549
You, you, you,
you're going back years.

363
00:23:15,573 --> 00:23:17,840
I don't remember any of this!

364
00:23:17,864 --> 00:23:25,864
I'm not as sharp as I used to be.
Christ sake.

365
00:23:29,733 --> 00:23:37,733
Superintendent Hastings
has left the room.

366
00:23:46,344 --> 00:23:47,664
Yes, we're going back years.

367
00:23:47,688 --> 00:23:49,749
He's bloody right
we've been going back years!

368
00:23:49,773 --> 00:23:51,669
This thing has been
driving me mad for years.

369
00:23:51,693 --> 00:23:54,069
Cybercrime aren't finished
tracing IP addresses, Sir.

370
00:23:54,093 --> 00:23:56,112
There's still a possibility
they'll detect evidence

371
00:23:56,136 --> 00:23:59,888
pointing at Fairbank. Look, he's
been in that prison since 2015!

372
00:23:59,912 --> 00:24:02,832
Our search should've
showed up something!

373
00:24:02,856 --> 00:24:04,688
Mother of God!

374
00:24:04,712 --> 00:24:07,120
Jesus. It's Chloe.

375
00:24:07,144 --> 00:24:08,949
So answer it, answer it!

376
00:24:08,973 --> 00:24:12,816
DI Arnott.

377
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,632
She's found something in
the Lawrence Christopher records.

378
00:24:15,656 --> 00:24:23,656
Well, let's go.

379
00:24:24,573 --> 00:24:28,432
Cybercrime have been examining all
the devices seized from Davidson,

380
00:24:28,456 --> 00:24:30,864
Buckells, Lisa McQueen
and the OCG men

381
00:24:30,888 --> 00:24:33,309
who attempted to abduct Davidson.

382
00:24:33,333 --> 00:24:35,536
As suggested by
Superintendent Hastings,

383
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:38,160
they carried out a search for
idiosyncrasies in grammar,

384
00:24:38,184 --> 00:24:40,509
punctuation and spelling.

385
00:24:40,533 --> 00:24:44,349
You'll recall this is the last
communication we intercepted.

386
00:24:44,373 --> 00:24:47,952
And this is the last exchange
between Jo Davidson

387
00:24:47,976 --> 00:24:51,344
and the user she believed
was Patrick Fairbank.

388
00:24:51,368 --> 00:24:54,429
Cybercrime told me they picked up on
the misspelling of "definitely"

389
00:24:54,453 --> 00:25:01,328
going back to exchanges
with Lisa McQueen in 2019.

390
00:25:01,352 --> 00:25:03,952
We've been able to extend the search
into files

391
00:25:03,976 --> 00:25:05,616
that we didn't have back then.

392
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,989
This is a handwritten report

393
00:25:08,013 --> 00:25:16,013
from the Lawrence Christopher
inquiry in 2003.

394
00:25:17,373 --> 00:25:24,112
And this is
from Operation Lighthouse in 2019.

395
00:25:24,136 --> 00:25:27,760
Christ, shit.

396
00:25:27,784 --> 00:25:30,192
This is the officer's signature
on both reports,

397
00:25:30,216 --> 00:25:33,789
2003 and 2019.

398
00:25:33,813 --> 00:25:35,632
Come off it. No way.

399
00:25:35,656 --> 00:25:41,520
This can't be right.

400
00:25:41,544 --> 00:25:43,509
Are you sure, Chloe?

401
00:25:43,533 --> 00:25:47,349
Cybercrime are attempting to trace IP
addresses that correspond to this suspect.

402
00:25:47,373 --> 00:25:50,109
Then we'll know for sure.

403
00:25:50,133 --> 00:25:51,504
Right, well,

404
00:25:51,528 --> 00:25:53,296
they better crack on.

405
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,792
Outstanding work, Chloe,
outstanding work.

406
00:25:55,816 --> 00:26:01,872
Sir.

407
00:26:01,896 --> 00:26:04,304
All this time we've been
chasing shadows.

408
00:26:04,328 --> 00:26:07,008
If this is right, he's been under
our noses from the very beginning.

409
00:26:07,032 --> 00:26:09,360
I mean, for God's sake,
what does this make us look like?

410
00:26:09,384 --> 00:26:11,536
Yes, but you heard Chloe.
We didn't have this before.

411
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,349
It's one thing getting your man,
it's another

412
00:26:13,373 --> 00:26:14,949
thing getting the
evidence to nail him,

413
00:26:14,973 --> 00:26:17,296
I mean, that's the battle
and battle we shall.

414
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,989
Let's see what Carmichael's got to
say for herself now.

415
00:26:20,013 --> 00:26:24,912
Sir, wait.

416
00:26:24,936 --> 00:26:29,904
You two look like you've lost
a shilling and found a penny.

417
00:26:29,928 --> 00:26:33,360
Sir, we need to be cautious
about disclosing this finding.

418
00:26:33,384 --> 00:26:35,152
AC-12's being disbanded,

419
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:38,229
DCS Carmichael put in charge of
downgrading anti-corruption.

420
00:26:38,253 --> 00:26:40,784
Yes, but after what we've achieved
here, I don't know,

421
00:26:40,808 --> 00:26:43,688
I've got a sneaking suspicion AC-12's
going to be around for a while yet.

422
00:26:43,712 --> 00:26:46,096
And, believe me, Kate,
if you want it,

423
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,760
there is a job here for you.

424
00:26:47,784 --> 00:26:50,349
Thank you, Sir,
but the point Steve's making is

425
00:26:50,373 --> 00:26:54,069
this finding is going to throw our
inquiry into the spotlight.

426
00:26:54,093 --> 00:26:58,989
Anything that might discredit
AC-12 will be held against us.

427
00:26:59,013 --> 00:27:02,160
What are you talking about?

428
00:27:02,184 --> 00:27:05,232
Sir, in the course of our inquiry
into Operation Lighthouse

429
00:27:05,256 --> 00:27:08,829
certain findings came to light
which relate to you.

430
00:27:08,853 --> 00:27:10,869
DI Arnott's been in contact with
Steph Corbett,

431
00:27:10,893 --> 00:27:14,000
John Corbett's widow.

432
00:27:14,024 --> 00:27:16,240
Yes, well, look,

433
00:27:16,264 --> 00:27:17,469
I know about that.

434
00:27:17,493 --> 00:27:18,928
She told me.

435
00:27:18,952 --> 00:27:22,192
To be honest, I didn't know what to
make of it, so I just let it lie.

436
00:27:22,216 --> 00:27:24,944
She also told me
about your, er...

437
00:27:24,968 --> 00:27:28,749
painkiller misuse, Steve.

438
00:27:28,773 --> 00:27:30,832
And I saw to it that you got help

439
00:27:30,856 --> 00:27:33,456
rather than disciplinary action.

440
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:36,080
It's called loyalty.

441
00:27:36,104 --> 00:27:37,808
Sir...

442
00:27:37,832 --> 00:27:40,560
during a non-lawful search
an item was found

443
00:27:40,584 --> 00:27:44,229
which relates to the missing
sum of £50,000.

444
00:27:44,253 --> 00:27:45,989
You're not under caution
so anything you say

445
00:27:46,013 --> 00:27:47,813
to us at this time can't
be used in evidence.

446
00:27:47,837 --> 00:27:55,029
That's loyalty right there.

447
00:27:55,053 --> 00:28:03,053
Take a seat.

448
00:28:04,413 --> 00:28:08,976
The money...

449
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,749
I swear to God,

450
00:28:10,773 --> 00:28:12,309
I was tricked.

451
00:28:12,333 --> 00:28:15,312
I was handed an envelope,
I was told it was one thing,

452
00:28:15,336 --> 00:28:16,912
I threw it to one side,

453
00:28:16,936 --> 00:28:18,512
thought nothing more about it.

454
00:28:18,536 --> 00:28:21,008
It turned out to be a big
bundle of cash.

455
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:23,829
I tried to return it,
I was blocked at every turn.

456
00:28:23,853 --> 00:28:25,872
Before I could hand it in
as evidence

457
00:28:25,896 --> 00:28:27,669
it was found.

458
00:28:27,693 --> 00:28:29,520
That was only half of it.

459
00:28:29,544 --> 00:28:31,632
You must've hidden the other
50,000.

460
00:28:31,656 --> 00:28:33,429
Yes, well,

461
00:28:33,453 --> 00:28:37,456
of course I realised it could
be a bribe that might turn nasty,

462
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:40,080
so I split it in half,
put one half safe,

463
00:28:40,104 --> 00:28:42,192
in case the OCG came looking,
you know.

464
00:28:42,216 --> 00:28:44,176
It was my insurance against them.

465
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,584
But, unfortunately for me,

466
00:28:45,608 --> 00:28:47,829
before I could use it as leverage
against them,

467
00:28:47,853 --> 00:28:49,893
or hand it in as
evidence, the other half was found.

468
00:28:49,917 --> 00:28:51,984
Instead you gave it to
Steph Corbett.

469
00:28:52,008 --> 00:28:54,429
Officially that money didn't exist.

470
00:28:54,453 --> 00:28:57,488
I mean, yes, yes, I could've
handed it in

471
00:28:57,512 --> 00:29:01,904
but instead I gave it to a young
woman with two wee girls...

472
00:29:01,928 --> 00:29:04,784
who'd have been left destitute
because her husband was killed

473
00:29:04,808 --> 00:29:08,112
in the line of duty.

474
00:29:08,136 --> 00:29:10,509
Are we done?

475
00:29:10,533 --> 00:29:13,552
No, Sir.

476
00:29:13,576 --> 00:29:16,389
As part of AC-12's inquiry
into Operation Lighthouse,

477
00:29:16,413 --> 00:29:19,888
DI Arnott interviewed Lee Banks...

478
00:29:19,912 --> 00:29:22,064
who disclosed the source of
information

479
00:29:22,088 --> 00:29:28,656
regarding John Corbett being
an undercover police officer.

480
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:31,088
I swear to God,

481
00:29:31,112 --> 00:29:36,549
I did not disclose John Corbett as
a UCO.

482
00:29:36,573 --> 00:29:40,048
I told Lee Banks that there was an
informant in the OCG,

483
00:29:40,072 --> 00:29:41,589
no more than that.

484
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,509
I thought that Corbett, when he
heard about it,

485
00:29:43,533 --> 00:29:45,360
he would go to ground, he'd hand
himself in

486
00:29:45,384 --> 00:29:46,749
at the nearest police station.

487
00:29:46,773 --> 00:29:50,032
It was by way of bringing him in,
I swear to God.

488
00:29:50,056 --> 00:29:54,448
You must've understood there was
a risk of Corbett coming to harm.

489
00:29:54,472 --> 00:29:59,760
Well, that is the worst part of it,
yes, yes.

490
00:29:59,784 --> 00:30:03,984
John Corbett had been involved in
the deaths of four police officers,

491
00:30:04,008 --> 00:30:06,032
our Maneet being one of them.

492
00:30:06,056 --> 00:30:08,720
He had beaten
and tortured my own wife,

493
00:30:08,744 --> 00:30:14,544
so I thought he had it coming to him
in spades.

494
00:30:14,568 --> 00:30:18,000
But what I didn't know...

495
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:19,989
was that he was the son of a woman

496
00:30:20,013 --> 00:30:23,312
I cared...

497
00:30:23,336 --> 00:30:26,384
deeply about...

498
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:30,608
many years ago.

499
00:30:30,632 --> 00:30:34,448
If there is one thing
I could take back...

500
00:30:34,472 --> 00:30:37,776
it would be that.

501
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:41,872
What a terrible thing I did.

502
00:30:41,896 --> 00:30:46,992
What a terrible thing I did.

503
00:30:47,016 --> 00:30:50,896
Giving that money to that young
woman was...

504
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:54,549
you know, by way of atonement...

505
00:30:54,573 --> 00:30:59,664
what little there was of it.

506
00:30:59,688 --> 00:31:01,520
Does Steph know the real reason?

507
00:31:01,544 --> 00:31:04,784
No.

508
00:31:04,808 --> 00:31:11,440
And if she did,
what would she make of it?

509
00:31:11,464 --> 00:31:15,344
Who's going to judge what I did?

510
00:31:15,368 --> 00:31:17,949
Her?

511
00:31:17,973 --> 00:31:23,408
The law?

512
00:31:23,432 --> 00:31:28,400
My colleagues?

513
00:31:28,424 --> 00:31:33,736
God?

514
00:33:17,864 --> 00:33:25,864
Sit down, fella.

515
00:33:34,893 --> 00:33:37,040
AC-12 interview by
Superintendent Hastings,

516
00:33:37,064 --> 00:33:42,224
DI Fleming, DI Arnott.

517
00:33:42,248 --> 00:33:44,949
Ian Buckells,
you do not have to say anything,

518
00:33:44,973 --> 00:33:46,960
but it may harm your defense
if you do not mention

519
00:33:46,984 --> 00:33:49,520
when questioned something you
later rely on in court.

520
00:33:49,544 --> 00:33:52,989
Anything you do say may be
used in evidence.

Image 124 on screen.

522
00:33:55,053 --> 00:33:59,120
Image 124 shows item reference
GGM-13

523
00:33:59,144 --> 00:34:01,872
recovered from your cell at
Blackthorn Prison.

524
00:34:01,896 --> 00:34:04,629
Interception of communications
routed via Spain

525
00:34:04,653 --> 00:34:07,952
detected an internet protocol
address matching GGM-13.

526
00:34:07,976 --> 00:34:10,269
Analysis of GGM-13's hard drive

527
00:34:10,293 --> 00:34:12,240
detected the communication

528
00:34:12,264 --> 00:34:19,216
shown in image 126.

529
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:22,544
Analysis of GGM-13's hard drive also
detected the communication

530
00:34:22,568 --> 00:34:26,000
shown in image 129.

531
00:34:26,024 --> 00:34:31,312
Note the misspelling of
"definitely".

532
00:34:31,336 --> 00:34:34,512
Document 105 in your folders.

533
00:34:34,536 --> 00:34:37,392
Document 105 is
a summary of analysis carried out

534
00:34:37,416 --> 00:34:39,248
by a forensic linguist.

535
00:34:39,272 --> 00:34:43,344
All digital communications
on the hard drive of GGM-13

536
00:34:43,368 --> 00:34:46,544
were examined using methodologies
based on examples of your spelling

537
00:34:46,568 --> 00:34:47,952
and syntax.

538
00:34:47,976 --> 00:34:51,088
Now, the report concludes there is
a 95% probability

539
00:34:51,112 --> 00:34:58,389
the messages detected on GGM-13
were written by you.

540
00:34:58,413 --> 00:35:00,624
Document 112 in your folders.

541
00:35:00,648 --> 00:35:04,208
Document 112 is
a summary of forensic examination

542
00:35:04,232 --> 00:35:08,469
of GGM-13 to detect
fingerprints and DNA deposits.

543
00:35:08,493 --> 00:35:11,952
Fingerprints and DNA detected
on GGM-13

544
00:35:11,976 --> 00:35:14,589
are a match to your fingerprints
and DNA

545
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:18,672
with a probability greater
than 99.9%.

546
00:35:18,696 --> 00:35:20,400
Ian Buckells,

547
00:35:20,424 --> 00:35:22,989
did you order the abduction

548
00:35:23,013 --> 00:35:26,544
of Detective Superintendent
Joanne Davidson...

549
00:35:26,568 --> 00:35:34,568
and the attempted murder
of Detective Inspector Kate Fleming?

550
00:35:36,488 --> 00:35:38,960
No comment.

551
00:35:38,984 --> 00:35:46,869
Did you order the murder
of Gail Vella and/or James Lakewell?

552
00:35:46,893 --> 00:35:48,496
No comment.

553
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:51,952
Further examination
of communications routed via Spain

554
00:35:51,976 --> 00:35:54,192
harvested a number of internet
protocol addresses

555
00:35:54,216 --> 00:35:57,136
previously unknown to this inquiry.

556
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:59,632
One such address relates to
a property in Edge Park,

557
00:35:59,656 --> 00:36:01,296
17 Maychurch Road

558
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:05,072
on screen image 135.

559
00:36:05,096 --> 00:36:07,389
Recognise this property?

560
00:36:07,413 --> 00:36:10,869
No comment.

561
00:36:10,893 --> 00:36:13,149
Document 194 in your folders.

562
00:36:13,173 --> 00:36:17,744
Document 194 is a photocopy
of the deeds to 17 Maychurch Road

563
00:36:17,768 --> 00:36:20,589
assigning ownership to a company,
Holte End Holdings,

564
00:36:20,613 --> 00:36:24,848
registered in the Cayman Islands.

565
00:36:24,872 --> 00:36:27,216
Document 197 in your folders.

566
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:30,800
Holte End Holdings owns a time-share
property in Gran Canaria

567
00:36:30,824 --> 00:36:32,784
as well as 17 Maychurch Road

568
00:36:32,808 --> 00:36:36,240
with an estimated total value of
£3 million.

569
00:36:36,264 --> 00:36:40,029
What's your relationship to
Holte End Holdings?

570
00:36:40,053 --> 00:36:42,960
No comment.

571
00:36:42,984 --> 00:36:45,584
I've worked with you three
times now.

572
00:36:45,608 --> 00:36:48,669
Undercover in 2012 with
Tony Gates's team.

573
00:36:48,693 --> 00:36:51,309
Undercover in 2017 with
Roz Huntley's team,

574
00:36:51,333 --> 00:36:54,672
and this year at Hillside Lane.

575
00:36:54,696 --> 00:36:56,592
Always the same crap suits,

576
00:36:56,616 --> 00:36:58,000
dud cars.

577
00:36:58,024 --> 00:37:01,392
I mean, you never put your hand
in your pocket when it's your round.

578
00:37:01,416 --> 00:37:06,384
You certainly did a grand job at
hiding all this, I'll give you that.

579
00:37:06,408 --> 00:37:09,968
But you are leading a double life.

580
00:37:09,992 --> 00:37:13,749

Image 138 shows Item Reference HS-6.

583
00:37:19,464 --> 00:37:21,808
HS-6 is a laptop computer

584
00:37:21,832 --> 00:37:25,072
detected under the floorboards
of 17 Maychurch Road.

585
00:37:25,096 --> 00:37:27,440
Analysis of HS-6's hard drive

586
00:37:27,464 --> 00:37:28,869
detected the communication

587
00:37:28,893 --> 00:37:34,288
shown in Image 141.

588
00:37:34,312 --> 00:37:36,912
Document 118 in your folders.

Document 118 is
a summary of forensic examination

590
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:45,104
of HS-6 to detect
fingerprints and DNA deposits.

591
00:37:45,128 --> 00:37:48,752
Fingerprints
and DNA detected on HS-6

592
00:37:48,776 --> 00:37:51,189
are a match to your fingerprints
and DNA

593
00:37:51,213 --> 00:37:54,640
with a probability greater
than 99.9%.

594
00:37:54,664 --> 00:37:58,096
Ian Buckells, did you order
organised criminal activities

595
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:00,144
such as the raid on Eastfield Depot

596
00:38:00,168 --> 00:38:04,112
on February the 15th 2019?

597
00:38:04,136 --> 00:38:05,589
No comment.

598
00:38:05,613 --> 00:38:09,680
These messages originated
from a device operated by you.

599
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:12,240
There's no point denying it.
We've shown you the evidence.

600
00:38:12,264 --> 00:38:15,440
We know from an undercover
officer embedded in that OCG,

601
00:38:15,464 --> 00:38:16,989
DS John Corbett,

602
00:38:17,013 --> 00:38:19,869
from a former member of that same
OCG, Lisa McQueen,

603
00:38:19,893 --> 00:38:22,269
that they sought
approval for the Eastfield robbery.

604
00:38:22,293 --> 00:38:23,888
Yeah, and they got it.

605
00:38:23,912 --> 00:38:28,560
From you, fella.

606
00:38:28,584 --> 00:38:30,069
No comment.

607
00:38:30,093 --> 00:38:34,064
We know from testimony given to us
by Joanne Davidson

608
00:38:34,088 --> 00:38:36,309
that after Tommy Hunter's death,

609
00:38:36,333 --> 00:38:40,336
disparate OCGs retained clandestine
relationships

610
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,192
with corrupt police officers.

611
00:38:42,216 --> 00:38:45,584
We also know from intercepted text
communications

612
00:38:45,608 --> 00:38:49,872
that these relationships were
orchestrated by one officer in particular,

613
00:38:49,896 --> 00:38:53,949
once wrongly codenamed "H",

614
00:38:53,973 --> 00:38:56,272
now referred to as the Fourth Man.

615
00:38:56,296 --> 00:39:01,269
Ian Buckells, are you the
Fourth Man?

616
00:39:01,293 --> 00:39:02,864
No comment.

617
00:39:02,888 --> 00:39:05,949
The secret life.

618
00:39:05,973 --> 00:39:07,600
The big house, the fast cars,

619
00:39:07,624 --> 00:39:09,392
the bits on the side,
Deborah Devereux.

620
00:39:09,416 --> 00:39:11,376
Is that what turned your head?

621
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,232
No comment.

622
00:39:13,256 --> 00:39:17,520
You know, over the years we have
investigated all manner of motives,

623
00:39:17,544 --> 00:39:19,509
but the most mundane, basest motive
of them all,

624
00:39:19,533 --> 00:39:22,512
plain simple greed.

625
00:39:22,536 --> 00:39:26,352
You were a DC on a bent team,

626
00:39:26,376 --> 00:39:30,960
Thurwell's, and as you made your way
up through the ranks

627
00:39:30,984 --> 00:39:33,060
there wasn't anything
that you wouldn't turn

628
00:39:33,084 --> 00:39:35,184
your hand to as long
as the price was right.

629
00:39:35,208 --> 00:39:37,629
That's the top and bottom of it,
isn't it, fella?

630
00:39:37,653 --> 00:39:38,832
No comment.

631
00:39:38,856 --> 00:39:41,264
You rose through the ranks,
all right,

632
00:39:41,288 --> 00:39:43,312
leaving a trail
of blunders behind you.

633
00:39:43,336 --> 00:39:46,989
How some people can fail upwards -
beggars belief.

634
00:39:47,013 --> 00:39:49,392
And all the time
we were here thinking

635
00:39:49,416 --> 00:39:51,440
we were chasing some criminal
mastermind.

636
00:39:51,464 --> 00:39:54,669
But no, just like your old boss
Thurwell

637
00:39:54,693 --> 00:39:57,712
who botched the Lawrence Christopher
murder inquiry,

638
00:39:57,736 --> 00:40:03,792
your corruption was
mistaken for incompetence!

639
00:40:03,816 --> 00:40:05,072
No comment.

640
00:40:05,096 --> 00:40:08,272
Your cover was so convincing that
even your DCI, Jo Davidson,

641
00:40:08,296 --> 00:40:11,349
didn't realise that the blundering
fool she was framing

642
00:40:11,373 --> 00:40:19,373
was actually the person who was
pulling her strings all along.

643
00:40:23,144 --> 00:40:26,512
Yeah, right. I'm a blundering fool.

644
00:40:26,536 --> 00:40:33,093
I'm only the one who's made
total mugs out of you lot.

645
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:51,429
Ian Buckells,
do you have anything to say?

646
00:40:51,453 --> 00:40:54,549
Yeah, you see, the thing is,
DCS Carmichael

647
00:40:54,573 --> 00:40:57,232
is meant to be taking over,
ain't she?

648
00:40:57,256 --> 00:40:59,709
But she ain't in here.

649
00:40:59,733 --> 00:41:03,120
So that makes me wonder whether
she doesn't want to be associated

650
00:41:03,144 --> 00:41:06,384
with detecting
institutionalised corruption.

651
00:41:06,408 --> 00:41:07,869
Because officially,

652
00:41:07,893 --> 00:41:12,080
institutionalised corruption
don't exist, does it?

653
00:41:12,104 --> 00:41:17,229
Officially, "H" or "the Fourth Man"
or whatever you want to call him,

654
00:41:17,253 --> 00:41:22,869
he don't exist neither.

655
00:41:22,893 --> 00:41:26,229
So that makes me realise that
everyone would be much happier

656
00:41:26,253 --> 00:41:29,552
if this all just went away.

657
00:41:29,576 --> 00:41:32,496
So I'll take immunity and witness
protection, thank you very much.

658
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:39,669
Jesus Christ.

659
00:41:39,693 --> 00:41:42,032
So, give us something.

660
00:41:42,056 --> 00:41:50,056
Who's the top man? You?

661
00:41:52,533 --> 00:41:55,152
Tommy Hunter was the top man.

662
00:41:55,176 --> 00:41:57,789
After he went,
they all split into different OCGs.

663
00:41:57,813 --> 00:42:00,464
I just pass on the orders.

664
00:42:00,488 --> 00:42:03,669
It used to be Fairbank and Thurwell,
then it was Hilton and Cottan,

665
00:42:03,693 --> 00:42:05,589
and now they've gone, it's just...

666
00:42:05,613 --> 00:42:07,389
You.

667
00:42:07,413 --> 00:42:12,309
The last man standing.

668
00:42:12,333 --> 00:42:15,376
So, you did order
the Eastfield robbery.

669
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:18,576
Well, a haul that size was
bigger than one gang.

670
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:22,352
The goods needed storing,
fencing, you name it.

671
00:42:22,376 --> 00:42:24,592
Other OCGs wanted in on it.

672
00:42:24,616 --> 00:42:27,024
And you just put
the pieces together?

673
00:42:27,048 --> 00:42:29,264
Yeah, if you like.

674
00:42:29,288 --> 00:42:32,144
And you also put the pieces
together for Lakewell's murder.

675
00:42:32,168 --> 00:42:34,960
Thurwell's. Gail Vella's.

676
00:42:34,984 --> 00:42:38,229
How many times do
I have to explain to you?

677
00:42:38,253 --> 00:42:41,360
That's the OCGs, that's their doing.

678
00:42:41,384 --> 00:42:43,389
I just pass things on.

679
00:42:43,413 --> 00:42:47,952
Have you no remorse for all
the suffering you've caused?

680
00:42:47,976 --> 00:42:49,749
Have you no conscience?

681
00:42:49,773 --> 00:42:52,688
I didn't plan it or nothing, did I?

682
00:42:52,712 --> 00:42:55,760
They just kept asking me
to sort bigger and bigger stuff.

683
00:42:55,784 --> 00:42:58,320
Jesus Christ, you're sitting
the other side of this table

684
00:42:58,344 --> 00:43:00,112
asking us for witness protection.

685
00:43:00,136 --> 00:43:04,336
It's me you're going to need
protection from!

686
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:12,360
Would you like a glass a water?

687
00:43:17,288 --> 00:43:21,189
Image 145.

688
00:43:21,213 --> 00:43:24,688
Now, the murders of Thurwell,
Hilton, Cottan and Lakewell.

689
00:43:24,712 --> 00:43:28,400
I get why the OCGs would be
the ones to order those.

690
00:43:28,424 --> 00:43:32,624
Like Tommy Hunter, their loyalty was
in question and they knew too much.

691
00:43:32,648 --> 00:43:34,869
Gail Vella was different.

692
00:43:34,893 --> 00:43:37,629
We know the last thing she uncovered
before Lee Banks passed

693
00:43:37,653 --> 00:43:39,600
the word on her to his brother Carl.

694
00:43:39,624 --> 00:43:42,736
It was the corruption inside
the Lawrence Christopher inquiry.

695
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:45,872
Tommy Hunter was dead,
his son Darren's a nobody.

696
00:43:45,896 --> 00:43:50,109
The OCG had no good reason to order
such a high-profile assassination.

697
00:43:50,133 --> 00:43:52,749
But two police officers involved in
that original corruption

698
00:43:52,773 --> 00:43:54,909
are now high-ranking.

699
00:43:54,933 --> 00:43:58,672
You and Chief Constable Osborne.

700
00:43:58,696 --> 00:44:02,320
And both of you had
a hell of a lot to lose.

701
00:44:02,344 --> 00:44:08,469
Ian Buckells, did you and/or
Chief Constable Osborne

702
00:44:08,493 --> 00:44:16,493
collude in a conspiracy
to murder Gail Vella?

703
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:24,272
Take your time, Ian.

704
00:44:24,296 --> 00:44:26,709
It's a simple enough question.

705
00:44:26,733 --> 00:44:29,712
But naturally, you're aware
failing to cooperate with

706
00:44:29,736 --> 00:44:35,024
this inquiry would make you
ineligible for witness protection.

707
00:44:35,048 --> 00:44:38,229
And you're also aware that
confessing to conspiracy to murder

708
00:44:38,253 --> 00:44:46,253
would make you ineligible
for immunity from prosecution.

709
00:44:47,733 --> 00:44:55,733
No-one makes mugs of AC-12.

710
00:45:03,213 --> 00:45:11,213
Interview terminated.

711
00:45:36,573 --> 00:45:43,440
Nice one, mate. Nice one, mate.

712
00:45:43,464 --> 00:45:47,109
Well, this is weird, ain't it?
Wrapping everything up.

713
00:45:47,133 --> 00:45:49,520
Do you think Buckells will talk?
I hope so.

714
00:45:49,544 --> 00:45:51,952
The gaffer wants him protected
round the clock, in case

715
00:45:51,976 --> 00:45:55,029
the OCG come after him.

716
00:45:55,053 --> 00:45:58,389
What we going to do
about the gaffer?

717
00:45:58,413 --> 00:46:00,976
I believe him. Yeah, me too.

718
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,389
But if Carmichael takes over,
that's him out anyway. Yeah.

719
00:46:04,413 --> 00:46:06,032
Probably me too.

720
00:46:06,056 --> 00:46:09,552
And me, if I decide to come back.

721
00:46:09,576 --> 00:46:15,789
Will you? Someone's got to keep
you lot in line.

722
00:46:15,813 --> 00:46:19,029
You don't realise what you've got
until it's gone.

723
00:46:19,053 --> 00:46:26,349
Likewise.

724
00:46:26,373 --> 00:46:33,616
So, do you want to talk about stuff?

725
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:38,109
You don't have to,
just when you're ready.

726
00:46:38,133 --> 00:46:40,912
I've been seeing the MO.

727
00:46:40,936 --> 00:46:43,152
About the painkillers?

728
00:46:43,176 --> 00:46:45,008
Yeah.

729
00:46:45,032 --> 00:46:47,120
I had no idea, mate.

730
00:46:47,144 --> 00:46:48,848
I should've told you.

731
00:46:48,872 --> 00:46:52,560
But if people knew, I might have
been taken off active duty.

732
00:46:52,584 --> 00:46:55,184
Still might.

733
00:46:55,208 --> 00:46:59,472
I'm sorry.

734
00:46:59,496 --> 00:47:02,709
You just going to stick to the
one drink?

735
00:47:02,733 --> 00:47:05,744
Why do you ask?

736
00:47:05,768 --> 00:47:09,584
It's still early enough to
drive up to Liverpool.

737
00:47:09,608 --> 00:47:12,789
I'm not sure it's a good
idea to keep seeing Steph.

738
00:47:12,813 --> 00:47:14,640
But you want to?

739
00:47:14,664 --> 00:47:16,304
Yeah.

740
00:47:16,328 --> 00:47:19,312
But what chance has it got?

741
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:22,320
You want to be careful, mate.
You're going to end up on your own.

742
00:47:22,344 --> 00:47:24,752
I'm not on my own.

743
00:47:24,776 --> 00:47:28,149
I've got you, mate.

744
00:47:28,173 --> 00:47:31,088
We recognise police officers
experience stress

745
00:47:31,112 --> 00:47:33,669
and pain in their work.

746
00:47:33,693 --> 00:47:35,829
They can take many forms.

747
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:40,048
Particularly when an officer's
witnessed lethal violence or

748
00:47:40,072 --> 00:47:42,480
taken part in it.

749
00:47:42,504 --> 00:47:45,936
Now, that's when the support of
friends, family, colleagues

750
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:50,109
can make all the difference.

751
00:47:50,133 --> 00:47:52,720
Me and my partner are separated.

752
00:47:52,744 --> 00:47:54,669
I've got a son - Josh.

753
00:47:54,693 --> 00:47:56,709
He keeps me going.

754
00:47:56,733 --> 00:47:59,589
And colleagues?

755
00:47:59,613 --> 00:48:01,552
Yeah, I'm lucky.

756
00:48:01,576 --> 00:48:05,648
I'm working with one of the best.

757
00:48:05,672 --> 00:48:13,672
To be honest, I don't know
what I'd do without him.

758
00:48:15,144 --> 00:48:17,829
Darren Hunter's involvement
in Lawrence Christopher's murder

759
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:20,240
was deliberately suppressed at the
time, due to Hunter

760
00:48:20,264 --> 00:48:24,016
being Tommy's son. I've asked MIT
to open a cold case inquiry,

761
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:26,109
try and get a conviction this time.

762
00:48:26,133 --> 00:48:28,629
Hm. Well, good luck with that.

763
00:48:28,653 --> 00:48:31,509
Ma'am, I'd like us to consider
opening a parallel inquiry.

764
00:48:31,533 --> 00:48:34,512
Thurwell gave the orders, no doubt
at the behest of Tommy Hunter,

765
00:48:34,536 --> 00:48:37,176
but it can't only have been Thurwell
who realised the investigation

766
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,504
was being sabotaged.
Some of Thurwell's subordinates

767
00:48:39,528 --> 00:48:43,029
are still serving police officers.
Historic corruption cases

768
00:48:43,053 --> 00:48:46,696
aren't a priority.

769
00:49:06,216 --> 00:49:08,624
Come in. Thank you.

770
00:49:08,648 --> 00:49:11,952
Steve, Kate. Sir. Sir.

771
00:49:11,976 --> 00:49:15,728
Ted. Ma'am.

772
00:49:15,752 --> 00:49:18,992
I thought I should inform you
that I have lodged an appeal

773
00:49:19,016 --> 00:49:22,749
against my enforced retirement.

774
00:49:22,773 --> 00:49:26,288
The Chief Constable's about to
make a statement. Do you mind?

775
00:49:26,312 --> 00:49:28,749
No, go ahead.

776
00:49:28,773 --> 00:49:32,624
Tribute to the tireless
dedication of my officers,

777
00:49:32,648 --> 00:49:37,680
who have gained justice
for Gail Vella.

778
00:49:37,704 --> 00:49:40,816
I give you my personal
assurance that any failings

779
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:45,552
in the original inquiry
will be thoroughly investigated.

780
00:49:45,576 --> 00:49:48,432
Lessons will be learnt.

781
00:49:48,456 --> 00:49:52,912
Throughout my career, whenever
I've encountered wrongdoing,

782
00:49:52,936 --> 00:49:54,960
I've acted.

783
00:49:54,984 --> 00:49:57,584
But let me be clear.

784
00:49:57,608 --> 00:50:00,720
These are the misdeeds
of a few rotten apples,

785
00:50:00,744 --> 00:50:04,269
and to invoke institutionalised
police corruption

786
00:50:04,293 --> 00:50:06,736
is an outrageous lie

787
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:10,000
and an insult to my officers.

788
00:50:10,024 --> 00:50:13,200
The public don't want police
officers to be held to account

789
00:50:13,224 --> 00:50:15,952
for every little thing
they're meant to have done.

790
00:50:15,976 --> 00:50:18,384
They want us to get on with the job.

791
00:50:18,408 --> 00:50:22,096
And that's what we will do.
Thank you.

792
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:27,549
AC-12, my team, my officers,
have just closed the biggest

793
00:50:27,573 --> 00:50:30,909
anti-corruption operation
that this force has ever seen.

794
00:50:30,933 --> 00:50:34,149
Just caught the last
ring-leader in a clandestine

795
00:50:34,173 --> 00:50:36,432
network of corrupt police officers.

796
00:50:36,456 --> 00:50:39,549
And the Chief Constable hasn't
a blind word to say about it!

797
00:50:39,573 --> 00:50:42,448
Look, proceedings against
Ian Buckells are now with

798
00:50:42,472 --> 00:50:44,829
the Crown Prosecutor.
It would be premature to draw

799
00:50:44,853 --> 00:50:47,376
conclusions about how much
was institutionalised

800
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:50,384
and how much was Ian Buckells
working alone.

801
00:50:50,408 --> 00:50:53,392
If I may, Ma'am.

802
00:50:53,416 --> 00:50:57,680
Ian Buckells was an incompetent
officer who was repeatedly

803
00:50:57,704 --> 00:50:59,728
promoted through the ranks.

804
00:50:59,752 --> 00:51:02,992
The more influence that he gained
over police operations,

805
00:51:03,016 --> 00:51:05,469
the more valuable
he became to the OCGs,

806
00:51:05,493 --> 00:51:09,072
till eventually, this
incompetent officer became

807
00:51:09,096 --> 00:51:12,080
the linchpin in
sinister enterprises.

808
00:51:12,104 --> 00:51:16,629
However, none of this, none of this
could have happened without

809
00:51:16,653 --> 00:51:18,928
the wilful blindness
of those in power.

810
00:51:18,952 --> 00:51:21,872
And those in power should be
held to account.

811
00:51:21,896 --> 00:51:25,149
It devastates me that we've stopped
standing up for accountability

812
00:51:25,173 --> 00:51:28,912
and we've stopped caring
about truth and integrity.

813
00:51:28,936 --> 00:51:33,072
Because it is these institutional
failures that enable

814
00:51:33,096 --> 00:51:38,960
the likes of Ian Buckells
to be corrupt.

815
00:51:38,984 --> 00:51:45,872
Ma'am.

816
00:51:45,896 --> 00:51:48,069
Thanks, Chloe. Ma'am.

817
00:51:48,093 --> 00:51:56,093
I'll let you out, Sir.

818
00:52:18,573 --> 00:52:26,573
Ma'am.

819
00:52:26,733 --> 00:52:29,648
I'd like to make a statement
about my involvement in the leak

820
00:52:29,672 --> 00:52:34,704
of information that led to the
unlawful killing...

821
00:52:34,728 --> 00:52:39,440
of a serving police officer,
Detective Sergeant John Corbett.

822
00:52:39,464 --> 00:52:42,512
In an interview conducted by me

823
00:52:42,536 --> 00:52:45,584
on a convicted OCG member,
Lee Banks, in Blackthorn Prison

824
00:52:45,608 --> 00:52:49,629
on the 12th of March 2019...

825
00:52:49,653 --> 00:52:53,520
I disclosed that there was
an informant in the OCG.

826
00:52:53,544 --> 00:52:56,720
I believe that this information
was passed on,

827
00:52:56,744 --> 00:52:59,664
and whether or not it was deduced
that Corbett was a UCO,

828
00:52:59,688 --> 00:53:02,864
he was murdered...

829
00:53:02,888 --> 00:53:09,909
because of the consequence
of my actions.

830
00:53:09,933 --> 00:53:12,976
What do you expect me
to do with that information?

831
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:16,432
Well...

832
00:53:16,456 --> 00:53:19,888
that's entirely up to you, Ma'am.

833
00:53:19,912 --> 00:53:23,600
But whatever you do...

834
00:53:23,624 --> 00:53:30,693
you do it because you care
about truth and accountability.

834
00:53:31,305 --> 00:54:31,225
