<i>Re. The unsolved murder
of Gail Vella,</i>

3
00:00:08,424 --> 00:00:11,646
<i>on September 10th, 2019.</i>

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:14,261
<i>The Gail Vella murder
weapon was never recovered.</i>

5
00:00:14,345 --> 00:00:15,589
- Moving.
<i>- However,</i>

6
00:00:15,673 --> 00:00:17,548
<i>the cartridge and bullet
were tailored ammunition.</i>

7
00:00:17,632 --> 00:00:18,963
<i>The White Rock unit
is equipped</i>

8
00:00:19,047 --> 00:00:22,011
with the exact machinery
required for this process.

9
00:00:23,776 --> 00:00:26,108
By the time
of our inquiry in 2015,

10
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:28,041
Thurwell had taken
early retirement.

11
00:00:28,125 --> 00:00:29,664
<i>Believed to be living
in Spain.</i>

12
00:00:29,748 --> 00:00:31,411
I wonder if Gail
discovered the link

13
00:00:31,495 --> 00:00:33,780
between Thurwell and
the Lawrence Christopher case.

14
00:00:35,315 --> 00:00:38,397
I've been looking into other
members of Thurwell's team.

15
00:00:38,721 --> 00:00:41,188
Detective Constable
Ian Buckells.

16
00:00:42,455 --> 00:00:44,179
Inspector Philip Osborne.

17
00:00:47,352 --> 00:00:49,235
I don't know where you're
getting your figures from...

18
00:00:49,319 --> 00:00:52,618
But the figures came from your
own office, Chief Constable.

19
00:00:52,702 --> 00:00:55,034
<i>The Chief's thrown
me under a bus.</i>

20
00:00:55,118 --> 00:00:58,014
<i>I've been fighting his plan
to scale back AC-12.</i>

21
00:00:58,443 --> 00:01:00,451
It's down to you now, Ted,

22
00:01:00,573 --> 00:01:02,319
in whatever time
you've got left.

You want to talk about rats,
ask your boss.

25
00:01:07,544 --> 00:01:08,989
Superintendent Hastings?

26
00:01:09,073 --> 00:01:11,257
Lee told me there was a rat
in our crew.

27
00:01:11,341 --> 00:01:14,674
That rat turned out to be
an undercover copper,

28
00:01:14,758 --> 00:01:16,188
John Corbett.

29
00:01:20,592 --> 00:01:22,164
It's easy as that, Jo.

30
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:24,339
It's best if you request
a transfer.

31
00:01:24,423 --> 00:01:26,095
Is this personal?

32
00:01:27,702 --> 00:01:29,411
I am Detective
Chief Superintendent

33
00:01:29,495 --> 00:01:31,346
Patricia Carmichael.

34
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:33,348
<i>Carmichael's taking command.</i>

35
00:01:33,432 --> 00:01:34,660
It's on the Chief
Constable's orders

36
00:01:34,744 --> 00:01:36,514
and we've just learned he
could have been a beneficiary

37
00:01:36,598 --> 00:01:38,116
of Gail Vella's murder.

One more chance, Ryan.

40
00:01:52,037 --> 00:01:53,161
- One more chance.
- Drop it.

41
00:01:53,245 --> 00:01:55,702
No!

42
00:02:12,643 --> 00:02:15,137
Seven-six.
Hold on. Clear to approach.

43
00:02:15,221 --> 00:02:16,978
Charlie seven-two
to Control.

44
00:02:17,062 --> 00:02:18,331
Vehicle at the scene.

45
00:02:18,415 --> 00:02:20,183
Body on the floor
next to the vehicle.

46
00:02:20,267 --> 00:02:21,835
Oh, shit.

47
00:02:25,795 --> 00:02:28,403
Kate's car's missing.
Request urgent ops.

48
00:02:28,487 --> 00:02:30,597
Alpha Charlie five
to Control, active message.

49
00:02:30,681 --> 00:02:31,993
Request urgent...

50
00:02:32,077 --> 00:02:33,719
Where is Kate?

51
00:02:33,803 --> 00:02:35,307
Seven, six.
All clear, sir.

52
00:02:35,391 --> 00:02:37,619
All arms. Clear to approach.
Search this area.

53
00:02:37,703 --> 00:02:39,725
Check that body
for signs of life.

54
00:02:39,809 --> 00:02:42,037
Repeat, service vehicle,
DI Fleming.

55
00:02:42,121 --> 00:02:44,039
Preserve the scene.
Let them work.

56
00:02:44,123 --> 00:02:45,593
Alfa Charlie five to control.

57
00:02:45,677 --> 00:02:48,561
Active message,
state six of Menton Road.

58
00:02:48,645 --> 00:02:50,356
One police. Major trauma.

59
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,531
Request urgent
paramedic attendance

60
00:02:52,615 --> 00:02:54,533
and full forensic deployment.

61
00:02:54,617 --> 00:02:57,052
Ryan Pilkington, two gunshot
wounds to the chest.

62
00:02:57,136 --> 00:02:59,434
- No pulse. He's well gone.
- Right.

63
00:02:59,518 --> 00:03:02,506
If you hadn't withdrawn
our bloody surveillance.

64
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:03,921
Given her OCG links,

65
00:03:04,005 --> 00:03:06,747
I think we have to assume that
Davidson, or her associates

66
00:03:07,112 --> 00:03:09,311
are the likely shooter.

67
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,098
DI Fleming was authorised

68
00:03:12,182 --> 00:03:15,819
to carry a concealed firearm
for her own protection.

69
00:03:18,192 --> 00:03:19,489
Five to switching.

70
00:03:19,573 --> 00:03:21,111
DI Fleming's vehicle.

71
00:03:21,195 --> 00:03:23,527
Alpha Charlie five to control

<i>Control service vehicle</i>

73

<i>Subject is not present

76
00:03:32,206 --> 00:03:33,399
Five two received.

77
00:03:33,483 --> 00:03:35,672
You know her best.
Where would she go?

78
00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:38,772
Sorry, ma'am.
I have no idea.

79
00:03:39,524 --> 00:03:40,993
Issue an order
for the arrest

80
00:03:41,077 --> 00:03:43,133
of Jo Davidson
and Kate Fleming.

81
00:03:43,217 --> 00:03:45,186
Consider them armed
and dangerous.

82
00:03:46,692 --> 00:03:49,041
<i>Charlie seven-six...</i>

83
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:53,324
This is the back entrance

84
00:03:53,408 --> 00:03:54,435
to Steve's.

85
00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:56,489
No one's around
this time of the night.

86
00:03:59,544 --> 00:04:02,601
- You sure you can trust him?
- Steve? Totally.

87
00:04:02,685 --> 00:04:04,913
Why wasn't there surveillance
on Ryan and me?

88
00:04:04,997 --> 00:04:06,225
It got suspended.

89
00:04:06,309 --> 00:04:07,502
On purpose?

90
00:04:07,586 --> 00:04:10,540
No. On the orders of
the Chief and DCS Carmichael.

91
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:11,886
That's nothing to do with me.

92
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:14,133
Look, I haven't got the
foggiest idea what's going on.

93
00:04:14,217 --> 00:04:16,635
All I know is
somebody's behind all of this.

94
00:04:19,564 --> 00:04:20,826
Kate, you've got to
believe me.

95
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:22,379
I had nothing to do with it.

96
00:04:22,463 --> 00:04:24,070
No?

97
00:04:24,154 --> 00:04:26,158
You lured me back
to be murdered.

98
00:04:26,536 --> 00:04:28,571
- Kate?
- Didn't ya?

99
00:04:33,543 --> 00:04:35,496
Now look where we are.
Ryan's dead,

100
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,290
and I'm in the frame for it.

101
00:04:37,374 --> 00:04:40,034
I'm sorry, Kate. That's
the last thing I'd want.

102
00:04:40,205 --> 00:04:42,243
You've got to believe me!

103
00:04:44,485 --> 00:04:47,110
- Let me prove it to you.
- How?

104
00:04:47,695 --> 00:04:49,181
Give me your gun.

105
00:05:10,511 --> 00:05:12,169
You believe me now?

106
00:05:15,274 --> 00:05:17,485
Great. Nice one, Steve.

107
00:05:21,177 --> 00:05:23,682
I always worried
you were pretending.

108
00:05:23,766 --> 00:05:26,770
- Pretending?
- You know what I mean.

109
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:29,359
To lure me into trusting you.

110
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:31,292
We gotta get a move on.

111
00:05:36,157 --> 00:05:38,144
Steve's been made a bloody DI.

112
00:05:38,228 --> 00:05:40,892
About time
he got a grown-up car.

113
00:05:51,863 --> 00:05:53,608
Yes, I can use a kick.

114
00:05:53,692 --> 00:05:55,971
Uh, sorry, sir. Nothing yet.

115
00:05:57,006 --> 00:05:58,820
DCS Carmichael has ordered me

116
00:05:58,904 --> 00:06:01,218
to update the Operation
Lighthouse evidence.

117
00:06:10,088 --> 00:06:11,746
Sorry.

118
00:06:34,872 --> 00:06:37,780
You still won't answer.
Were you lying to me, Kate?

119
00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:40,103
This
is about you, Jo. Not me.

120
00:06:40,187 --> 00:06:41,587
You said you wanted
me on your team

121
00:06:41,671 --> 00:06:42,968
because I'm ex
anti-corruption.

122
00:06:43,052 --> 00:06:45,142
- Were you lying about that?
- No.

123
00:06:45,226 --> 00:06:46,652
I thought it might
help me resist

124
00:06:46,736 --> 00:06:48,145
what they were forcing
me to do.

125
00:06:48,229 --> 00:06:49,975
You never stopped
manipulating the inquiry

126
00:06:50,059 --> 00:06:51,148
into the Gail Vella murder.

127
00:06:51,232 --> 00:06:53,392
They control me!

128
00:06:53,476 --> 00:06:54,918
Ever since
I joined the force,

129
00:06:55,002 --> 00:06:58,121
the more I did their bidding,
the more they had over me.

130
00:06:58,205 --> 00:07:00,226
- I'm not bent.
- Well then, prove it.

131
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:02,245
You'll get witness protection
if you tell us everything...

132
00:07:02,329 --> 00:07:04,638
Witness protection?
Even to...

133
00:07:07,283 --> 00:07:09,581
No matter who it is,
however powerful,

134
00:07:09,665 --> 00:07:12,117
when they turn,
they get killed.

135
00:07:12,288 --> 00:07:13,446
What chance do I stand?

136
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:15,414
Just tell me everything
you know, Jo.

137
00:07:15,498 --> 00:07:16,588
Starting with your family.

138
00:07:16,672 --> 00:07:19,124
You nearly said his name.
Tommy Hunter.

139
00:07:23,575 --> 00:07:25,838
AC-12 found DNA
in Farida's house

140
00:07:25,922 --> 00:07:27,408
showing you're related.

141
00:07:28,684 --> 00:07:30,291
So you already know
everything?

142
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:32,378
Hardly. I need the truth.

143
00:07:36,864 --> 00:07:38,902
My mum was Tommy's sister.

144
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:43,148
My dad was...
been a police officer.

145
00:07:46,011 --> 00:07:48,412
Right. Well the only way
you're getting out of this

146
00:07:48,496 --> 00:07:50,258
is to prove you're not bent.

147
00:07:58,575 --> 00:08:00,597
It's Gail Vella's house.

148
00:08:00,681 --> 00:08:03,409
You want proof I'm not bent,
you're about to get it.

149
00:08:05,341 --> 00:08:07,758
End of the road, turn left.

150
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:11,831
DCS Carmichael

151
00:08:31,367 --> 00:08:34,475
Carmichael's on the move.
Not sure what's happening.

152
00:08:37,292 --> 00:08:40,435
Well, let's not wait
for the crumbs, son.

153
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:48,178
Pull up here.

154
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,225
This place used to be
a front for the OCG.

155
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:03,439
And right across
the street is?

156
00:09:03,636 --> 00:09:05,502
Terry Boyle's flat.

157
00:09:08,562 --> 00:09:10,201
Shit!

158
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:30,646
Time to estimate,
six, control. Active message.

159
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:32,309
Visual with suspect vehicle.

160
00:09:32,393 --> 00:09:35,264
T.A. Market Street.
Travelling at speed.

161
00:09:39,297 --> 00:09:40,886
Oh, shit!

162
00:09:43,542 --> 00:09:44,998
Brace!

163
00:09:49,548 --> 00:09:50,569
Go!

164
00:09:50,653 --> 00:09:53,158
Control, suspect vehicle
failed to comply.

165
00:09:53,242 --> 00:09:55,280
Initiating pursuit.

166
00:10:02,699 --> 00:10:06,843
Six, five. Maintain obs and...

167
00:10:26,689 --> 00:10:28,209
Shit!

168
00:10:33,316 --> 00:10:35,734
Police!

169
00:10:38,563 --> 00:10:40,584
Get out of the vehicle
with your arms raised

170
00:10:40,668 --> 00:10:44,501
and your hands open,
with palms facing towards me.

171
00:10:48,918 --> 00:10:50,560
Police! Get back.

172
00:10:50,644 --> 00:10:53,821
Armed police. Stay indoors.
Get back!

173
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:56,497
How did they manage
to intercept us?

174
00:10:56,581 --> 00:10:58,223
Something's not right.

175
00:10:58,307 --> 00:11:00,570
Get out the vehicle
with your arms raised

176
00:11:00,654 --> 00:11:03,849
and your hands open,
with palms towards me.

177
00:11:03,933 --> 00:11:05,230
Final warning.

178
00:11:05,314 --> 00:11:07,163
This isn't your fault.

179
00:11:07,247 --> 00:11:09,682
I'll say I forced you
to drive me.

180
00:11:09,766 --> 00:11:11,823
Get out of the vehicle
with your arms raised,

181
00:11:11,907 --> 00:11:15,309
your hands open,
with palms towards me.

182
00:11:15,393 --> 00:11:17,258
Kate, we don't
have a choice.

183
00:11:20,018 --> 00:11:22,937
<i>Control, two occupants
still in vehicle.</i>

184
00:11:23,021 --> 00:11:24,766
<i>Controls eight,
four, received.</i>

185
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,976
<i>We have a visual link
from helicopter.</i>

186
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,511
<i>Maintain sitrep.</i>

187
00:11:29,821 --> 00:11:32,947
...persons exiting
the vehicle now.

188
00:11:33,031 --> 00:11:35,191
<i>Control to eight
four, received.</i>

189
00:11:35,275 --> 00:11:38,056
We're police officers.
DI Fleming.

190
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,540
DSU Davidson.

191
00:11:39,624 --> 00:11:43,268
Hands above your head.
Open them, palms towards me.

192
00:11:43,352 --> 00:11:45,995
I'm a police officer,
going about my lawful duty.

193
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:47,237
Lower your weapons.

194
00:11:47,321 --> 00:11:50,084
Hands above your head.
Open them.

195
00:11:56,503 --> 00:11:59,990
DCS Carmichael,
you are ordered to surrender.

196
00:12:02,095 --> 00:12:04,926
Jesus Christ!
Steve's in on it.

197
00:12:11,207 --> 00:12:13,125
I'm taking out a pistol.

198
00:12:13,209 --> 00:12:15,079
I'll put it on the grounds.

199
00:12:22,042 --> 00:12:25,405
DI Fleming,
surrender your firearm.

200
00:12:26,119 --> 00:12:28,015
Jo, we're being framed.

201
00:12:28,397 --> 00:12:32,437
This is your final warning.
Lay down your firearm.

202
00:12:37,371 --> 00:12:41,135
Slowly.
Hands where we can see them.

203
00:12:43,412 --> 00:12:46,641
<i>Alpha Charlie
eight four control...</i>

204
00:12:46,725 --> 00:12:48,333
We surrender.

205
00:12:48,417 --> 00:12:49,863
- Kate!
- No.

206
00:12:49,947 --> 00:12:51,605
<i>Hand on weapon.</i>

207
00:12:53,146 --> 00:12:55,287
Ma'am, if I may?

208
00:13:00,774 --> 00:13:02,888
This is Superintendent,
Hastings.

209
00:13:02,972 --> 00:13:06,155
I can assure you
you'll be treated fairly,

210
00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:08,890
with the full protection
of the law.

211
00:13:09,397 --> 00:13:12,919
Steve told me some bad stuff
about the gaffer.

212
00:13:14,019 --> 00:13:15,815
This is my fault, sir.

213
00:13:21,174 --> 00:13:24,491
DI Steve Arnott.
I'm unarmed.

214
00:13:27,698 --> 00:13:29,443
You bastard, Steve.

215
00:13:29,527 --> 00:13:32,070
Stay there, Kate.

216
00:13:32,425 --> 00:13:35,380
Take the gun out slowly,
lay it on the ground.

217
00:13:35,464 --> 00:13:37,244
You gave me up.
You told them.

218
00:13:37,328 --> 00:13:39,694
Kate, I give you my word,
I didn't.

219
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:40,730
That's bullshit.

220
00:13:40,814 --> 00:13:42,249
How would they know
what car I'm driving?

221
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:44,267
Kate, listen to me.

222
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:46,425
I don't know
how they knew.

223
00:13:46,509 --> 00:13:48,151
If it came from me,
I'd be straight with you.

224
00:13:48,235 --> 00:13:49,544
That's how it is between us,

225
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:51,465
and I'm telling you,
I didn't give you up.

226
00:13:51,549 --> 00:13:52,984
Neither did the gaffer.

227
00:13:53,068 --> 00:13:55,865
<i>DI Arnott,
now with two occupants...</i>

228
00:13:58,418 --> 00:13:59,611
Come on, mate.

229
00:13:59,695 --> 00:14:01,854
I don't know what the hell
is going on either.

230
00:14:01,938 --> 00:14:03,891
Why the Chief's ordered
Carmichael to take over.

231
00:14:03,975 --> 00:14:06,910
But I promise you,
I'll get you to safety.

232
00:14:08,738 --> 00:14:10,293
Both of you.

233
00:14:15,952 --> 00:14:17,456
She's cooperating.

234
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:19,371
Lay it on the ground.

235
00:14:23,995 --> 00:14:25,826
She's put the gun down.

236
00:14:27,964 --> 00:14:30,382
Come with me.
I'll walk you in.

237
00:14:30,753 --> 00:14:32,357
Get behind me.

238
00:14:32,441 --> 00:14:34,237
You too, ma'am.

239
00:14:35,144 --> 00:14:37,028
<i>Both suspects
now walking towards us</i>

240
00:14:37,112 --> 00:14:39,253
<i>with arms raised...</i>

241
00:14:40,529 --> 00:14:43,291
Check out the old
OCG print shop.

242
00:14:43,635 --> 00:14:45,590
Also, Ryan Pilkington
confessed

243
00:14:45,674 --> 00:14:48,574
to the murder of Maneet Bindra
and John Corbett.

244
00:14:51,091 --> 00:14:53,354
Don't you worry, kid.
I'll see you're well looked after

245
00:14:53,438 --> 00:14:55,959
or, by Christ,
they'll have me to answer to.

246
00:14:57,132 --> 00:14:59,135
Arrest them both.

247
00:15:00,019 --> 00:15:03,157
Put them in forensic suits,
transfer them to dry cells.

248
00:15:03,241 --> 00:15:05,486
Lock the ridge
of the transport vehicle.

249
00:15:52,689 --> 00:15:55,383
You should have shared Kate's
whereabouts with me.

250
00:15:57,019 --> 00:15:58,109
I didn't want to put you in

251
00:15:58,193 --> 00:16:00,083
a difficult position
with Carmichael.

252
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:09,014
Kate told me Ryan Pilkington
confessed to Maneet's murder.

253
00:16:10,897 --> 00:16:13,004
Pilkington!

254
00:16:13,282 --> 00:16:15,872
He also confessed
to the murder of John Corbett.

255
00:16:26,945 --> 00:16:27,966
Ma'am.

256
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:31,314
Ma'am, the interviews
with Davidson and Kate...

257
00:16:31,398 --> 00:16:33,661
DI Arnott and I will be
involved, of course.

258
00:16:33,745 --> 00:16:36,043
We know the inquiry
like the back of our hands.

259
00:16:36,127 --> 00:16:37,838
Hmm. DI Arnott,

260
00:16:37,922 --> 00:16:39,736
I've just learned
the vehicle was yours,

261
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:44,274
and keys to your home were
found on DI Fleming's person.

262
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:46,778
We've got keys to each other's
homes and vehicles

263
00:16:46,862 --> 00:16:48,883
in the event
of extreme circumstances.

264
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:51,334
Oh, okay. Yes. I see.

265
00:16:51,418 --> 00:16:53,992
What would constitute
extreme circumstances?

266
00:16:54,076 --> 00:16:56,839
An unexplained disruption
of the chain of command.

267
00:17:00,427 --> 00:17:02,690
Superintendent Hastings
has been informed

268
00:17:02,774 --> 00:17:05,106
of his impending
retirement.

269
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:08,455
Ma'am, I must protest. That
information was confidential.

270
00:17:08,539 --> 00:17:09,904
And so, to ensure
a smooth transition,

271
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:12,252
I've assumed command.
So, from now on, DI Arnott,

272
00:17:12,336 --> 00:17:13,529
you'll be taking
orders from me,

273
00:17:13,613 --> 00:17:15,512
or face
disciplinary action.

274
00:17:18,549 --> 00:17:21,415
Is there anything else
you're not sharing with me?

275
00:17:25,314 --> 00:17:27,612
I'm waiting.

276
00:17:27,696 --> 00:17:30,994
Kate said we should check
out the old OCG print shop,

277
00:17:31,078 --> 00:17:33,134
from where John Corbett
worked.

278
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:34,877
Very good.

279
00:17:35,704 --> 00:17:37,760
I'll report back after
Davidson's respite

280
00:17:37,844 --> 00:17:40,107
to assist me
in interviewing her.

281
00:17:40,191 --> 00:17:41,902
Dismissed. Thank you.

282
00:17:41,986 --> 00:17:43,506
Ma'am.

283
00:17:51,064 --> 00:17:52,326
I'll lead the interview

284
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:56,312
and you can assist within
parameters set by me.

285
00:17:57,188 --> 00:17:59,122
Do you think
you can manage that?

286
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,526
Very good.

287
00:18:04,353 --> 00:18:06,582
I'll see you
in the morning.

288
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:09,774
How did you know of Davidson
and Kate's whereabouts?

289
00:18:10,635 --> 00:18:13,225
Oh, we put trackers
in all AC-12 vehicles.

290
00:18:13,914 --> 00:18:15,038
What?

291
00:18:15,122 --> 00:18:16,953
Hmm.
Chief Constable's orders.

292
00:18:17,159 --> 00:18:18,318
Thank goodness we did.

293
00:18:18,402 --> 00:18:21,355
My officers were going
about their lawful duty.

294
00:18:21,439 --> 00:18:23,150
Putting trackers
on their vehicles

295
00:18:23,234 --> 00:18:26,411
was a flagrant
breach of trust.

296
00:18:27,445 --> 00:18:29,724
No, you're right, Ted.

297
00:18:30,966 --> 00:18:33,383
The Chief and I
don't trust you.

298

by Chief Superintendent
Carmichael,

Superintendent Hastings,
Detective Inspector Arnott.

304
00:19:04,896 --> 00:19:06,469
You remain under caution.

305
00:19:06,553 --> 00:19:07,712
Following your arrest,

306
00:19:07,796 --> 00:19:09,748
a search of your
registered address,

307

apartment G-9,
Croxford Street

308

G-9, Croxford Street.

314
00:19:25,192 --> 00:19:27,299
Who is seen in image 17?

315
00:19:28,955 --> 00:19:30,873
No comment.

is Samantha Davidson,
correct?

00:19:47,525 --> 00:19:49,995
Document six is acting
DSU Davidson's

323
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:51,480
police personnel record.

324
00:19:51,564 --> 00:19:53,965
Next of kin is given
as Samantha Davidson.

325
00:19:54,049 --> 00:19:56,312
What is your relationship
to Samantha Davidson?

326
00:19:56,396 --> 00:19:57,555
No comment.

327
00:19:57,639 --> 00:20:00,799
Oh, God, give me strength.
It's gonna be a long day.

328
00:20:00,883 --> 00:20:02,905
We carried out checks
on Samantha Davidson.

329
00:20:02,989 --> 00:20:06,426
Passport shown in Document 22
is the last one on record.

330
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:07,841
An interim death certificate
was issued

331
00:20:07,925 --> 00:20:11,189
for Samantha Davidson
on the 5th of January, 1996,

332
00:20:11,273 --> 00:20:13,502
by the Glasgow City coroner.

333
00:20:13,586 --> 00:20:16,021
Subsequent inquest
into Samantha Davidson's death

334
00:20:16,105 --> 00:20:18,212
recorded a finding of suicide.

335
00:20:20,282 --> 00:20:22,078
You all right, Jo?

336
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:25,376
The purpose of our questioning
is not to trigger

337
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:28,344
painful memories,
but rather to address...

338
00:20:28,428 --> 00:20:31,432
an important aspect
of our inquiry.

339
00:20:32,846 --> 00:20:34,937
Document 33 in your folders.

340
00:20:35,021 --> 00:20:37,560
Document 33 is
a forensic laboratory report

341
00:20:37,644 --> 00:20:40,563
submitted on the 19th
of November, 2020,

342
00:20:40,647 --> 00:20:43,048
relating to DNA deposits
detected during a search

343
00:20:43,132 --> 00:20:46,120
of 29 Stalton Drive
conducted up to and including

344
00:20:46,204 --> 00:20:48,571
the 16th of November, 2020.

345
00:20:48,655 --> 00:20:50,366
Comparison of said DNA deposits

346
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:53,507
found 100% match with DNA
held on the national database

347
00:20:53,591 --> 00:20:55,613
belonging to Joanne Davidson.

348
00:20:55,697 --> 00:20:57,615
Further comparison
with criminal databases

349
00:20:57,699 --> 00:21:00,772
found a strong partial match
to John Thomas Hunter.

350
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:04,396
Are you related by
blood to John Thomas Hunter?

351
00:21:05,189 --> 00:21:06,589
- No comment.
- Okay.

352
00:21:06,673 --> 00:21:08,764
Just gave you an opportunity
to declare whether or not

353
00:21:08,848 --> 00:21:11,456
you are familiar with
what we're about to disclose.

354
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,664
If not, you may find

355
00:21:12,748 --> 00:21:15,391
the following information
distressing. DI Arnott.

356
00:21:15,475 --> 00:21:17,911
Document 33A.

357
00:21:17,995 --> 00:21:21,362
Further analysis of the DNA
found at 29 Stalton Drive

358
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:23,951
detected run of homozygosity.

359
00:21:24,035 --> 00:21:26,264
This is an indicator
of a close blood relationship

360
00:21:26,348 --> 00:21:28,577
between the subject's
mother and father.

361
00:21:28,661 --> 00:21:30,613
With a percentage match
to Tommy Hunter,

362
00:21:30,697 --> 00:21:33,271
it has been concluded
that Hunter was your uncle

363
00:21:33,355 --> 00:21:35,220
and also your father.

364
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:40,985
No.

365
00:21:44,262 --> 00:21:46,387
No. He...

366
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:49,131
He was my uncle. That's...

367
00:21:49,267 --> 00:21:51,961
But that's not true.

368
00:21:57,552 --> 00:21:59,486
So what is the truth?

369
00:22:00,037 --> 00:22:02,473
You can see
my colleague's distress.

370
00:22:02,557 --> 00:22:03,957
Perhaps we could
have a short break.

371
00:22:04,041 --> 00:22:05,683
It's a simple
enough question for Acting

372
00:22:05,767 --> 00:22:08,357
Detective Superintendent
Davidson to answer.

373
00:22:10,116 --> 00:22:11,912
No comment.

374
00:22:15,259 --> 00:22:17,108
Okay. I think
we should pause this interview

375
00:22:17,192 --> 00:22:19,697
and return you to custody
until such time,

376
00:22:19,781 --> 00:22:21,319
if any, you're willing
to cooperate...

377
00:22:21,403 --> 00:22:23,234
Ma'am, wait.

378
00:22:23,612 --> 00:22:25,063
Please.

379
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:27,636
Jo, if you're bent,

380
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,247
fine if you wanna
run the clock down.

381
00:22:30,331 --> 00:22:31,811
We'll charge you,
and with the evidence

382
00:22:31,895 --> 00:22:34,344
we've got, you'll go away
for a long time.

383
00:22:34,589 --> 00:22:36,369
But if you're not bent,

384
00:22:36,453 --> 00:22:38,698
this is your chance
to prove it.

385
00:22:40,042 --> 00:22:42,685
These things we've learned
about your family history,

386
00:22:42,769 --> 00:22:45,101
no one can be blamed
for what they're born into.

387
00:22:45,185 --> 00:22:47,085
Or the path
that it puts them on.

388
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:50,364
Now's the time
to give your side.

389
00:22:59,165 --> 00:23:00,892
No comment.

390
00:23:02,789 --> 00:23:05,639
You were still only a teenager
when you lost your mum.

391
00:23:05,723 --> 00:23:07,519
It must have been
very upsetting.

392
00:23:09,796 --> 00:23:11,300
No comment.

393
00:23:11,384 --> 00:23:13,474
If you think you're going to
wear us down,

394
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:15,753
Acting Detective
Superintendent Davidson,

395
00:23:15,837 --> 00:23:18,825
you have got
another thing coming.

396
00:23:18,909 --> 00:23:20,205
DI Arnott.

397
00:23:20,289 --> 00:23:22,587
The search of apartment
G-9 Croxford Street

398
00:23:22,671 --> 00:23:24,520
detected an article
seized in evidence

399
00:23:24,604 --> 00:23:27,454
appearing onscreen
in Image 11.

400
00:23:27,538 --> 00:23:30,112
Image 11 shows
item reference PW-5,

401
00:23:30,196 --> 00:23:31,992
a laptop computer.

402
00:23:32,336 --> 00:23:34,167
Whose device is this?

403
00:23:35,891 --> 00:23:37,119
No comment.

404
00:23:37,203 --> 00:23:39,742
Forensic examination
of PW-5 detected fingerprints

405
00:23:39,826 --> 00:23:42,365
and DNA deposits
relating to one person only.

406
00:23:42,449 --> 00:23:43,677
Said fingerprints and DNA

407
00:23:43,761 --> 00:23:45,833
are a match
for Joanne Davidson.

408
00:23:47,178 --> 00:23:50,010
For what purpose
did you employ this device?

409
00:23:50,699 --> 00:23:52,306
No comment.

410
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:54,739
Document 56 in your folders.

411
00:23:54,979 --> 00:23:56,828
AC-12's Cybercrime Department

412
00:23:56,912 --> 00:23:59,555
carried out an examination
of PW-5's hard drive.

413
00:23:59,639 --> 00:24:02,489
Their findings are fully
summarised in Document 56.

414
00:24:02,573 --> 00:24:04,180
There are numerous
text conversations

415
00:24:04,264 --> 00:24:07,045
between the user of PW-5
and an unknown user.

416
00:24:07,129 --> 00:24:10,375
Who are the participants
in these text conversations?

417
00:24:10,754 --> 00:24:11,912
No comment.

418
00:24:11,996 --> 00:24:14,363
Our Cybercrime Department
detected an IP address

419
00:24:14,447 --> 00:24:18,367
for the PW-5 user
matching 9 Croxford Street.

420
00:24:18,451 --> 00:24:21,835
The IP address for the unknown
user is located in Spain.

421
00:24:23,076 --> 00:24:24,373
No comment.

422
00:24:24,457 --> 00:24:27,116
What was the nature
of these text conversations?

423
00:24:27,218 --> 00:24:28,342
No comment.

424
00:24:28,426 --> 00:24:30,344
Jesus, Mary and Joseph
and the wee donkey,

425
00:24:30,428 --> 00:24:31,851
can we just move
this thing along

426
00:24:31,935 --> 00:24:33,969
before it drives us all
round the bloody bend?

427
00:24:34,053 --> 00:24:35,073
DI Arnott.

428
00:24:35,157 --> 00:24:36,316
Please refer to the screen,

429
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,697
which shows
a text conversation

430
00:24:37,781 --> 00:24:41,217
which took place on
the 22nd of November, 21:42,

431
00:24:41,301 --> 00:24:44,565
between the user of PW-5
and an unknown user.

432
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:47,707
Can you tell us what is meant
by the instruction...

433
00:24:47,791 --> 00:24:49,725
"Get rid of her"?

434
00:24:50,621 --> 00:24:51,745
No comment.

435
00:24:51,829 --> 00:24:54,437
You agreed to lure
DI Fleming to her death.

436
00:24:54,521 --> 00:24:56,939
That's about the top
and bottom of it, isn't it?

437
00:24:58,249 --> 00:24:59,339
No comment.

438
00:24:59,423 --> 00:25:00,892
Look,
you could say no comment

439
00:25:00,976 --> 00:25:03,412
till you're blue in the face,
but we know what's what.

440
00:25:03,496 --> 00:25:05,345
DI Fleming made a call
to DI Arnott

441
00:25:05,429 --> 00:25:06,898
just minutes before
an illicit rendezvous

442
00:25:06,982 --> 00:25:10,263
took place between you
and PC Ryan Pilkington.

443
00:25:11,884 --> 00:25:13,042
No comment.

444
00:25:13,126 --> 00:25:14,630
You lured her
to that rendezvous,

445
00:25:14,714 --> 00:25:16,287
and there is the evidence
up there

446
00:25:16,371 --> 00:25:18,876
on the screen
in black and white.

447
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,499
Conspiracy to murder
which, as you know,

448
00:25:21,583 --> 00:25:23,397
Acting Detective
Superintendent Davidson,

449
00:25:23,481 --> 00:25:26,815
brings with it
a life sentence.

450
00:25:26,899 --> 00:25:29,438
And that's before we get
to the rest of the evidence,

451
00:25:29,522 --> 00:25:32,733
which I would describe
as a mountain,

452
00:25:32,836 --> 00:25:35,306
a mountain of evidence.

453
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:37,980
We haven't even
scratched the surface.

454
00:25:45,158 --> 00:25:47,127
I was asking about your mum.

455
00:25:50,785 --> 00:25:52,288
Yes.

456
00:25:52,372 --> 00:25:54,238
She took her own life.

457
00:25:58,171 --> 00:25:59,967
Yes.

458
00:26:01,278 --> 00:26:02,816
This must be
very painful for you,

459
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:05,249
but do you think
you can speak about that?

460
00:26:08,147 --> 00:26:11,945
She was born into it,
same as me.

461
00:26:13,117 --> 00:26:15,811
Hated what our family
stood for.

462
00:26:16,569 --> 00:26:19,332
Her brother told me...

463
00:26:20,504 --> 00:26:21,766
what a piece of work he was.

464
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:23,008
Oh, yeah,
you don't need to tell us

465
00:26:23,092 --> 00:26:25,752
what he was capable of,
believe you me.

466
00:26:26,096 --> 00:26:28,272
He controlled mum's life.

467
00:26:28,477 --> 00:26:30,722
Did he control yours?

468
00:26:32,378 --> 00:26:34,692
Not at first.

469
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:38,887
My mum was still a girl.

470
00:26:38,971 --> 00:26:40,698
Fifteen.

471
00:26:41,042 --> 00:26:43,217
Raped, she told me.

472
00:26:44,977 --> 00:26:47,429
Though I never knew
the details.

473
00:26:49,844 --> 00:26:52,813
Forced to go through
with the pregnancy.

474
00:26:52,985 --> 00:26:54,488
Tommy sent her away,

475
00:26:54,572 --> 00:26:57,301
back to Glasgow
under her mum's maiden name.

476
00:26:58,542 --> 00:27:00,874
I had no idea
about any of this

477
00:27:00,958 --> 00:27:03,118
until Tommy came looking.

478
00:27:03,202 --> 00:27:05,309
But that was later. Yes?

479
00:27:05,894 --> 00:27:08,882
I'd just turned 16.

480
00:27:08,966 --> 00:27:11,333
He'd heard
I was doing well in school.

481
00:27:11,417 --> 00:27:14,835
Never been in trouble.
Plus, no one knew me here.

482
00:27:15,524 --> 00:27:17,270
He wanted me for the police.

483
00:27:17,354 --> 00:27:20,204
He said, to do his bidding,

484
00:27:20,288 --> 00:27:22,498
to be under his control.

485
00:27:32,127 --> 00:27:34,183
My mum
couldn't bear the thought

486
00:27:34,267 --> 00:27:36,358
of me being with Uncle Tommy.

487
00:27:36,442 --> 00:27:38,963
She knew
she couldn't protect me.

488
00:27:40,066 --> 00:27:42,207
That's why
she took her own life.

489
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:46,039
Yes.

490
00:27:46,659 --> 00:27:49,387
It's all right. Take
your time. Take your time.

491
00:27:49,765 --> 00:27:51,700
You're doing well, Jo.

492
00:27:54,943 --> 00:27:57,982
So Tommy hid from you
he was your real father?

493
00:27:59,189 --> 00:28:00,916
Yes.

494
00:28:01,674 --> 00:28:03,953
Who did you believe
was your father?

495
00:28:08,267 --> 00:28:09,874
This person,

496
00:28:09,958 --> 00:28:12,118
did he control you
the same way Tommy Hunter did?

497
00:28:12,202 --> 00:28:13,567
We can all see
my colleague finds

498
00:28:13,651 --> 00:28:16,674
this line of questioning
extremely distressing.

499
00:28:16,758 --> 00:28:18,400
In regard
to coercion and control,

500
00:28:18,484 --> 00:28:20,954
my colleague should be treated
as a vulnerable person.

501
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:22,243
We'll move on. Tommy Hunter's

502
00:28:22,327 --> 00:28:23,543
no longer
a person of interest.

503
00:28:23,627 --> 00:28:25,410
I mean, he became an informant
and was killed

504
00:28:25,494 --> 00:28:28,375
by his own organisation
in 2014.

505
00:28:28,459 --> 00:28:31,878
It wasn't simply that
he was an informant, ma'am.

506
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:34,312
What do you mean?

507
00:28:34,396 --> 00:28:36,556
Tommy had
cultivated relationships

508
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,489
with corrupt police officers.

509
00:28:38,573 --> 00:28:41,094
But they started
to turn against him.

510
00:28:41,921 --> 00:28:44,062
He felt betrayed,

511
00:28:45,028 --> 00:28:48,188
so he threatened
to expose the mole.

512
00:28:48,272 --> 00:28:51,916
So it was police officers
who got Hunter killed?

513
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,367
They were heavily involved.

514
00:28:54,451 --> 00:28:56,162
As you know,
your former officer,

515
00:28:56,246 --> 00:28:59,199
DI Matthew Cottan,
he orchestrated the plan.

516
00:28:59,283 --> 00:29:00,925
Cottan was a disgrace
to the uniform.

517
00:29:01,009 --> 00:29:02,962
He betrayed the trust
of every single one of us

518
00:29:03,046 --> 00:29:04,308
that he worked with.

519
00:29:04,392 --> 00:29:05,550
So someone took Tommy's place

520
00:29:05,634 --> 00:29:06,931
at the top
of the organisation,

521
00:29:07,015 --> 00:29:09,382
and he gave Cottan
the order to kill Tommy?

522
00:29:09,466 --> 00:29:12,247
Tommy held it altogether.

523
00:29:12,331 --> 00:29:14,939
It broke up
into disparate elements.

524
00:29:15,023 --> 00:29:16,354
Smaller OCGs.

525
00:29:16,438 --> 00:29:17,942
The only thing
that united them was

526
00:29:18,026 --> 00:29:19,185
how much they stood to lose

527
00:29:19,269 --> 00:29:20,807
if Tommy carried out
his threat.

528
00:29:20,891 --> 00:29:22,498
'Cause they relied
on corrupt officers

529
00:29:22,582 --> 00:29:24,915
to carry out many of their
criminal enterprises?

530
00:29:24,999 --> 00:29:26,502
Yes.

531
00:29:26,586 --> 00:29:29,471
And they wanted to be able
to continue exploiting them.

532
00:29:29,555 --> 00:29:32,025
Yes, well, the OCGs, they may
not be working to one man,

533
00:29:32,109 --> 00:29:34,510
but the bent coppers,
that's a different story.

534
00:29:34,594 --> 00:29:35,931
They're a network,
aren't they?

535
00:29:36,015 --> 00:29:37,431
This force has detected
no evidence

536
00:29:37,515 --> 00:29:38,894
of institutionalised
corruption.

537
00:29:38,978 --> 00:29:41,483
We have identified a number
of high-ranking figures

538
00:29:41,567 --> 00:29:44,486
in a clandestine network
of corrupt police officers.

539
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:45,970
Hypothetical network.

540
00:29:46,054 --> 00:29:47,627
One such high-ranking figure,

541
00:29:47,711 --> 00:29:49,456
once erroneously codenamed H,

542
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:51,769
we now refer to
as the fourth man,

543
00:29:51,853 --> 00:29:53,373
is he running the show?

544
00:29:54,994 --> 00:29:56,480
No comment.

545
00:29:57,514 --> 00:29:59,535
We're here to examine
DCI Davidson's offending.

546
00:29:59,619 --> 00:30:01,952
- No one else's.
- Alleged offending.

547
00:30:02,036 --> 00:30:03,850
Are you taking
your orders from him?

548
00:30:03,934 --> 00:30:05,868
Who is the fourth man?

549
00:30:07,558 --> 00:30:09,856
- I don't know.
- I don't believe you.

550
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:11,651
Let's move on. Turning
to Operation Lighthouse,

551
00:30:11,735 --> 00:30:13,860
the inquiry
into the murder of Gail Vella,

552
00:30:13,944 --> 00:30:16,656
opened on the 10th
of September, 2019.

553
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:19,348
You became senior
investigating officer when?

554
00:30:19,432 --> 00:30:21,601
The following month,
6th of October.

555
00:30:21,685 --> 00:30:23,063
Your predecessor was removed

556
00:30:23,147 --> 00:30:26,095
allegedly due to the inquiry's
slow progress.

557
00:30:27,026 --> 00:30:29,340
How did you
come to be appointed?

558
00:30:29,822 --> 00:30:32,861
I'm an experienced
murder investigator.

559
00:30:33,412 --> 00:30:35,760
Image 24 on screen.

560
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:41,957
What is shown on Image 24?

561
00:30:42,041 --> 00:30:43,579
No comment.

562
00:30:43,663 --> 00:30:46,582
Image 24 shows
item reference FD-8

563
00:30:46,666 --> 00:30:48,791
seized in evidence
during a search of apartment

564
00:30:48,875 --> 00:30:50,448
G-9 Croxford Street.

565
00:30:50,532 --> 00:30:52,692
Document 39 in your folders.

566
00:30:52,776 --> 00:30:56,109
Document 39 is a photocopy
of the content of FD-8.

567
00:30:56,193 --> 00:30:58,008
You will see that FD-8
contain documents

568
00:30:58,092 --> 00:30:59,699
relating to Operation Lighthouse.

569
00:30:59,783 --> 00:31:01,230
Now these documents
were not present

570
00:31:01,314 --> 00:31:02,613
at Hillside Lane
Police Station

571
00:31:02,697 --> 00:31:04,428
on the 4th of November
of this year,

572
00:31:04,512 --> 00:31:06,154
when AC-12 seized all files

573
00:31:06,238 --> 00:31:07,638
relating to Operation Lighthouse.

574
00:31:07,722 --> 00:31:10,208
Why were these documents
in your apartment?

575
00:31:11,243 --> 00:31:12,608
No comment.

576
00:31:12,692 --> 00:31:14,438
These documents
revealed for the first time

577
00:31:14,522 --> 00:31:16,854
that Detective Superintendent
Ian Buckells noted

578
00:31:16,938 --> 00:31:20,754
that your predecessor and SIO
was pursuing a line of inquiry

579
00:31:20,838 --> 00:31:23,447
that Gail Vella's murder
was a contract killing

580
00:31:23,531 --> 00:31:25,552
carried out
by organised criminals.

581
00:31:25,636 --> 00:31:28,141
However, Detective
Superintendent Buckells

582
00:31:28,225 --> 00:31:29,936
then wrote a memorandum
suggesting that

583
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:32,766
the SIO was failing
to make any progress

584
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:35,493
and that a new SIO
be appointed.

585
00:31:35,577 --> 00:31:38,892
Buckells mentions you by name.
Did you ever work together?

586
00:31:39,409 --> 00:31:41,361
Not to my knowledge.

587
00:31:41,445 --> 00:31:44,537
Hmm. So what motivated
Ian Buckells nominating you

588
00:31:44,621 --> 00:31:46,504
to be the senior
investigating officer

589
00:31:46,588 --> 00:31:47,988
on the Gail Vella murder?

590
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:49,473
You'd have to ask
Ian Buckells.

591
00:31:49,557 --> 00:31:50,646
Yes, well, we did,

592
00:31:50,730 --> 00:31:53,718
and he denies all knowledge
of the documents.

593
00:31:53,802 --> 00:31:55,671
The same way
he still claims no knowledge

594
00:31:55,755 --> 00:31:57,499
of the missing
Operation Lighthouse files

595
00:31:57,583 --> 00:32:00,070
subsequently found hidden
in his service vehicle.

596
00:32:00,154 --> 00:32:03,176
Did you,
or someone close to you,

597
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:04,453
engineer your appointment

598
00:32:04,537 --> 00:32:07,111
with Buckells
as the convenient stooge?

599
00:32:07,195 --> 00:32:08,492
No comment.

600
00:32:08,576 --> 00:32:10,494
You see, the last thing that
organised crime would want

601
00:32:10,578 --> 00:32:12,668
is Operation Lighthouse
coming knocking on their door.

602
00:32:12,752 --> 00:32:14,360
So they had to put in
a new SIO

603
00:32:14,444 --> 00:32:16,327
to suppress
that line of inquiry

604
00:32:16,411 --> 00:32:18,743
in favour of a random
act of violence

605
00:32:18,827 --> 00:32:22,161
perpetrated by a disturbed
individual acting alone.

606
00:32:22,245 --> 00:32:25,129
A frame that neatly fits
Terry Boyle.

607
00:32:25,213 --> 00:32:27,907
I refused
to charge Terry Boyle.

608
00:32:28,147 --> 00:32:29,582
Well, why not?

609
00:32:29,666 --> 00:32:31,239
There was just about
enough evidence.

610
00:32:31,323 --> 00:32:34,223
Why did you not seek authority
to charge Boyle?

611
00:32:36,673 --> 00:32:39,363
Was it because you
couldn't go through with it?

612
00:32:42,403 --> 00:32:44,666
Is it because you just
couldn't live with the idea

613
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:47,961
of sending an innocent man
to trial?

614
00:32:49,237 --> 00:32:50,964
Yes.

615
00:32:51,757 --> 00:32:54,400
Good. At last,
we're getting somewhere.

616
00:32:54,484 --> 00:32:56,402
Okay, let's examine
the other recent prime suspect

617
00:32:56,486 --> 00:32:58,938
identified by Operation Lighthouse.

618
00:32:59,109 --> 00:33:01,200
Image 29 on screen.

619
00:33:01,284 --> 00:33:03,754
Image 29 shows
Terry Boyle on the right.

620
00:33:03,838 --> 00:33:06,274
On the left,
Image 29 shows Carl Banks.

621
00:33:06,358 --> 00:33:08,138
Carl Banks
was a nonviolent offender

622
00:33:08,222 --> 00:33:10,519
with lifelong links
to organised crime.

623
00:33:10,603 --> 00:33:12,003
On the night
of the 26th of October,

624
00:33:12,087 --> 00:33:14,144
the Murder Investigation Team
received a tip-off

625
00:33:14,228 --> 00:33:16,732
that an individual who was
almost certainly Carl Banks

626
00:33:16,816 --> 00:33:19,321
had confessed
to the murder of Gail Vella.

627
00:33:19,405 --> 00:33:21,323
As a result
of delays and leaks,

628
00:33:21,407 --> 00:33:23,325
Carl Banks was abducted
and murdered

629
00:33:23,409 --> 00:33:25,396
and Terry Boyle
installed in his place.

630
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:28,261
PS Farida Jatri was charged
with leaking the information

631
00:33:28,345 --> 00:33:32,645
based on evidence
seized from 29 Stalton Drive.

632
00:33:32,729 --> 00:33:36,442
The address where she claims
the two of you lived.

633
00:33:36,526 --> 00:33:39,703
Did you plant evidence
against Farida Jatri?

634
00:33:41,876 --> 00:33:43,396
No comment.

635
00:33:45,017 --> 00:33:46,417
You've already told us

636
00:33:46,501 --> 00:33:49,627
that you were coerced
into a life of crime,

637
00:33:49,711 --> 00:33:53,252
that you were forced
to mislead and deceive.

638
00:33:53,336 --> 00:33:56,029
Here, now, you have a choice.

639
00:33:56,339 --> 00:33:59,964
A choice to tell the truth.

640
00:34:08,178 --> 00:34:10,372
I planted the burner phones.

641
00:34:10,456 --> 00:34:12,494
Farida's innocent.

642
00:34:12,976 --> 00:34:14,496
Good.

643
00:34:15,185 --> 00:34:17,379
Good.

644
00:34:17,463 --> 00:34:19,933
Who leaked the information
regarding the operation

645
00:34:20,017 --> 00:34:21,832
to arrest Carl Banks?

646
00:34:21,916 --> 00:34:23,074
I did.

647
00:34:23,158 --> 00:34:24,179
And the armed robbery

648
00:34:24,263 --> 00:34:26,319
staged to coincide
with the operation...

649
00:34:26,403 --> 00:34:27,907
You knew about that?

650
00:34:27,991 --> 00:34:31,359
It was a decoy I used
to delay Banks' arrest.

651
00:34:31,443 --> 00:34:32,890
And the mistakes
in surveillance

652
00:34:32,974 --> 00:34:35,708
attributed Detective
Superintendent Buckells.

653
00:34:35,792 --> 00:34:38,952
I manipulated him into those.
It wasn't hard.

654
00:34:39,036 --> 00:34:40,230
And the files
that were planted

655
00:34:40,314 --> 00:34:41,903
in his service vehicle?

656
00:34:43,109 --> 00:34:45,131
I planted those.

657
00:34:45,215 --> 00:34:46,560
What about the witness
who came forward

658
00:34:46,644 --> 00:34:47,996
to incriminate Terry Boyle?

659
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,411
Deborah Devereux.

660
00:34:49,495 --> 00:34:50,619
All I know is we found out

661
00:34:50,703 --> 00:34:53,691
she was a former girlfriend
of DSU Buckells.

662
00:34:53,775 --> 00:34:56,142
And the full statement
from Deborah Devereux,

663
00:34:56,226 --> 00:34:57,764
Buckells set that up?

664
00:34:57,848 --> 00:35:00,974
I don't know if he set that up
himself or someone else did.

665
00:35:01,058 --> 00:35:02,820
Why would he do that?

666
00:35:03,406 --> 00:35:05,807
He was worried the failure
to solve the murder

667
00:35:05,891 --> 00:35:07,567
was making him look bad.

668
00:35:07,651 --> 00:35:09,776
He was desperate for me
to charge someone.

669
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:11,882
Let's be clear.
You have no evidence

670
00:35:11,966 --> 00:35:13,311
that Buckells was responsible

671
00:35:13,395 --> 00:35:15,368
for Deborah Devereux's
full statement?

672
00:35:15,452 --> 00:35:16,852
Correct, ma'am.

673
00:35:16,936 --> 00:35:19,199
And his desire
to charge Terry Boyle

674
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:21,340
was born
out of a legitimate fear

675
00:35:21,424 --> 00:35:23,807
for the advancement
of his career?

676
00:35:23,943 --> 00:35:26,206
It appeared so, ma'am.

677
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:27,863
DI Arnott, can you bookmark
the DI's answer as

678
00:35:27,947 --> 00:35:29,140
a significant testimony

679
00:35:29,224 --> 00:35:30,538
in determining
whether the charges

680
00:35:30,622 --> 00:35:31,921
against Detective
Superintendent Buckells

681
00:35:32,005 --> 00:35:33,455
should be discontinued?

682
00:35:37,785 --> 00:35:39,219
Okay, moving on.
What can you tell us

683
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:41,755
about the evidence
against Terry Boyle?

684
00:35:42,583 --> 00:35:45,191
The images of Gail Vella
found in his flat

685
00:35:45,275 --> 00:35:46,710
would seem
to have been planted.

686
00:35:46,794 --> 00:35:48,884
To the best of your knowledge,
was Terry Boyle involved

687
00:35:48,968 --> 00:35:50,764
in the murder of Gail Vella?

688
00:35:50,867 --> 00:35:52,440
No, he was not.

689
00:35:52,524 --> 00:35:54,959
To the best of your knowledge,
was Carl Banks involved

690
00:35:55,043 --> 00:35:57,116
in the murder of Gail Vella?

691
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:02,312
No comment.

692
00:36:02,396 --> 00:36:04,348
Here we go again.

693
00:36:04,432 --> 00:36:06,316
We know Gail Vella attempted
to make contact

694
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,179
with Carl Banks' brother,
Lee Banks,

695
00:36:08,263 --> 00:36:10,232
an inmate
in Blackthorn Prison.

696
00:36:10,783 --> 00:36:12,494
We believe
Lee Banks informed Carl

697
00:36:12,578 --> 00:36:14,151
Gail Vella
was investigating stories

698
00:36:14,235 --> 00:36:16,602
that the OCG
were determined to suppress.

699
00:36:16,686 --> 00:36:19,087
In regards Gail Vella's
investigative journalism,

700
00:36:19,171 --> 00:36:20,606
let's now examine
your movements

701
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:23,505
prior to your arrest
last night. DI Arnott.

702
00:36:23,589 --> 00:36:25,680
On screen, Image 41.

703
00:36:25,764 --> 00:36:27,820
Image 41 is a map
showing telemetry

704
00:36:27,904 --> 00:36:29,580
from a tracking device
attached to vehicle

705
00:36:29,664 --> 00:36:32,514
Victor, Oscar, 6-9,
Golf, Kilo, Yankee

706
00:36:32,598 --> 00:36:35,862
in the early hours
of the 24th of November, 2020.

707
00:36:35,946 --> 00:36:38,451
Victor, Oscar, 6-9,
Golf, Kilo, Yankee

708
00:36:38,535 --> 00:36:40,108
is the vehicle in which
you were a passenger

709
00:36:40,192 --> 00:36:41,937
at the time of your arrest.

710
00:36:42,021 --> 00:36:44,699
Telemetry location two is the
scene of Gail Vella's murder.

711
00:36:44,783 --> 00:36:48,150
Telemetry location three
relates the derelict premises

712
00:36:48,234 --> 00:36:49,980
of the Kingsgate
Printing Services.

713
00:36:50,064 --> 00:36:52,757
Who's directing
the movements of the vehicle?

714
00:36:53,412 --> 00:36:54,709
No comment.

715
00:36:54,793 --> 00:36:56,987
A forensic search
of Kingsgate Printing Services

716
00:36:57,071 --> 00:36:59,281
has been carried out.

717
00:36:59,936 --> 00:37:01,716
Image 45 on screen.

718
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,856
Image 45,
it's a crime scene photograph

719
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:06,341
captured at
Kingsgate Printing services,

720
00:37:06,425 --> 00:37:09,050
showing the inside
of the abandoned premises.

721
00:37:09,152 --> 00:37:10,966
Image 46.

722
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:13,037
Image 46
is an item of evidence

723
00:37:13,121 --> 00:37:14,487
detected by the search team.

724
00:37:14,571 --> 00:37:16,247
Item reference TG-8.

725
00:37:16,331 --> 00:37:18,388
TG-8 is a metal strongbox.

726
00:37:18,472 --> 00:37:21,786
Contents of TG-8
shown in Image 47.

727
00:37:22,545 --> 00:37:24,980
What is shown in Image 47?

728
00:37:25,064 --> 00:37:26,568
No comment.

729
00:37:26,652 --> 00:37:30,883
Image 47 shows item references
TG-11 and TG-12.

730
00:37:30,967 --> 00:37:31,815
A laptop computer

731
00:37:31,899 --> 00:37:34,058
and desktop computer,
respectively.

732
00:37:34,142 --> 00:37:36,267
Forensic examination
of these devices

733
00:37:36,351 --> 00:37:38,684
detected fingerprints
matching Gail Vella.

734
00:37:38,768 --> 00:37:40,340
We believe
these devices were stolen

735
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:42,550
from Gail Vella's home
around the time of her murder.

736
00:37:42,634 --> 00:37:45,691
Now the Operation Lighthouse
files that you withheld

737
00:37:45,775 --> 00:37:50,489
relate in part to evidence
of the theft of these devices.

738
00:37:50,573 --> 00:37:53,957
This is crucial evidence
you hid.

739
00:37:54,611 --> 00:37:56,667
I was leading
Kate Fleming there

740
00:37:56,751 --> 00:37:59,272
to uncover
the evidence to prove...

741
00:38:01,756 --> 00:38:03,380
Prove what?

742
00:38:05,104 --> 00:38:07,246
That I'm not bent.

743
00:38:07,969 --> 00:38:11,199
Yes, but you hid this evidence
for months.

744
00:38:11,283 --> 00:38:13,700
Not months. No.

745
00:38:14,148 --> 00:38:16,117
That's not what happened.

746
00:38:16,806 --> 00:38:19,379
I only began to suspect
the evidence might be there

747
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:21,777
after Terry Boyle's arrest.

748
00:38:22,743 --> 00:38:26,559
The print shop had been
long abandoned by the OCG.

749
00:38:26,643 --> 00:38:29,217
Police searches
concluded there 18 months ago,

750
00:38:29,301 --> 00:38:31,840
and it was
right across the street.

751
00:38:31,924 --> 00:38:34,480
But you never ordered
a search of the print shop.

752
00:38:37,723 --> 00:38:38,985
Cyber Crime examined

753
00:38:39,069 --> 00:38:40,987
the hard drives
of both devices.

754
00:38:41,071 --> 00:38:44,266
Passwords were input
to access the stored files.

755
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:46,360
How were these passwords
being obtained?

756
00:38:47,353 --> 00:38:48,443
No comment.

757
00:38:48,527 --> 00:38:49,548
Well, taking for granted

758
00:38:49,632 --> 00:38:51,377
the involvement
of organised crime,

759
00:38:51,461 --> 00:38:53,448
I'd suggest an employee
in the IT Department

760
00:38:53,532 --> 00:38:55,519
of Gail Vella's news service
was exploited

761
00:38:55,603 --> 00:38:58,711
using bribery, blackmail
or intimidation.

762
00:38:59,262 --> 00:39:00,351
No comment.

763
00:39:00,435 --> 00:39:01,663
Numerous files were detected

764
00:39:01,747 --> 00:39:03,389
relating to Gail Vella's
investigations

765
00:39:03,473 --> 00:39:05,184
into the links
between organised crime

766
00:39:05,268 --> 00:39:06,926
and corrupt police officers.

767
00:39:07,132 --> 00:39:08,532
We have found audio files

768
00:39:08,616 --> 00:39:10,569
of interviews
of Jimmy Lakewell.

769
00:39:10,653 --> 00:39:12,329
We have found research files

770
00:39:12,413 --> 00:39:14,469
confirming that Gail Vella
was investigating

771
00:39:14,553 --> 00:39:16,402
the suppression
of police inquiries

772
00:39:16,486 --> 00:39:19,957
into historic
child sexual exploitation.

773
00:39:20,041 --> 00:39:21,200
And we have found research

774
00:39:21,284 --> 00:39:24,237
confirming that Gail Vella
was digging deep

775
00:39:24,321 --> 00:39:26,136
into police failure

776
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:28,913
in the murder
of Lawrence Christopher.

777
00:39:30,258 --> 00:39:31,693
Did you know
Gail Vella was looking

778
00:39:31,777 --> 00:39:33,626
into the Lawrence Christopher
murder?

779
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:35,230
No.

780
00:39:36,023 --> 00:39:37,354
According to notes
found on Gail Vella's devices,

781
00:39:37,438 --> 00:39:40,184
she visited Lee Banks
on 26th of August, 2019,

782
00:39:40,268 --> 00:39:41,461
in Blackthorn Prison.

783
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:45,051
Now as you know, Lee Banks
is Carl Banks' brother.

784
00:39:45,135 --> 00:39:46,432
It appears
from Gail Vella's notes

785
00:39:46,516 --> 00:39:48,434
that Lee Banks declined
to furnish any information

786
00:39:48,518 --> 00:39:50,712
regarding the murder
of Lawrence Christopher.

787
00:39:50,796 --> 00:39:52,714
We believe
Lee informed Carl Banks

788
00:39:52,798 --> 00:39:56,166
and this was in large part
the motivation for her murder.

789
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:57,788
Do you really
expect us to believe

790
00:39:57,872 --> 00:39:59,427
that you didn't know this?

791
00:40:00,703 --> 00:40:02,103
I didn't.

792
00:40:02,187 --> 00:40:04,139
I'll give you "I didn't".

793
00:40:04,223 --> 00:40:05,416
One of the suspects

794
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:06,901
in the Lawrence Christopher
murder is your cousin,

795
00:40:06,985 --> 00:40:08,919
Darren Hunter.

796
00:40:10,057 --> 00:40:11,630
I, erm...

797
00:40:11,714 --> 00:40:13,597
I mean, maybe if
Darren had been arrested,

798
00:40:13,681 --> 00:40:14,801
he would have squealed.

799
00:40:14,885 --> 00:40:16,151
He would have given up
Tommy Hunter.

800
00:40:16,235 --> 00:40:17,715
He would have given up you.

801
00:40:17,799 --> 00:40:19,943
I... I didn't know.

802
00:40:20,027 --> 00:40:22,747
The initial inquiry into
Lawrence Christopher's murder

803
00:40:22,831 --> 00:40:25,160
was led by
DCI Marcus Thurwell.

804
00:40:25,244 --> 00:40:26,902
Do you know that name?

805
00:40:28,282 --> 00:40:29,371
No comment.

806
00:40:29,455 --> 00:40:31,907
On screen, image 75.

807
00:40:36,255 --> 00:40:38,811
Who is shown an image 75?

808
00:40:39,293 --> 00:40:41,089
No comment.

809
00:40:42,745 --> 00:40:44,697
On screen, image 77.

810
00:40:44,781 --> 00:40:47,233
The last known image
of the same individual.

811
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:49,028
Who is that?

812
00:40:49,337 --> 00:40:51,152
No comment.

813
00:40:51,236 --> 00:40:53,791
Image 77
shows Marcus Thurwell.

814
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,795
What's your relationship
to Marcus Thurwell?

815
00:40:59,658 --> 00:41:00,575
No comment.

816
00:41:00,659 --> 00:41:02,784
Files detected
on Gail Vella's computer

817
00:41:02,868 --> 00:41:04,268
proved that
she was investigating,

818
00:41:04,352 --> 00:41:05,476
not just Thurwell's role,

819
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:08,806
but the role of other officers
in the inquiry.

820
00:41:09,737 --> 00:41:13,105
Notably Detective Constable
Ian Buckells,

821
00:41:13,189 --> 00:41:16,020
and Inspector Philip Osborne.

822
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:19,387
The interviewee
has repeatedly claimed

823
00:41:19,471 --> 00:41:21,665
she doesn't know
about any of this.

824
00:41:21,749 --> 00:41:23,373
It's a dead end.

825
00:41:26,305 --> 00:41:27,740
So let's focus on events

826
00:41:27,824 --> 00:41:30,536
surrounding the killing
of PC Ryan Pilkington.

827
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:33,504
Ma'am,
this is significant evidence

828
00:41:33,588 --> 00:41:35,575
crucial to the wider inquiry

829
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:38,199
into institutionalised
corruption.

830
00:41:38,283 --> 00:41:41,098
Yes, and I would prefer
to confine ourselves

831
00:41:41,182 --> 00:41:42,341
to the set parameters

832
00:41:42,425 --> 00:41:45,326
of the anti-corruption inquiry
in front of us.

833
00:41:45,877 --> 00:41:47,173
DI Arnott,

834
00:41:47,257 --> 00:41:48,485
if you wouldn't mind,

835
00:41:48,569 --> 00:41:50,848
let's jiffy things along,
shall we?

836
00:41:51,123 --> 00:41:52,781
Ma'am.

837
00:41:53,022 --> 00:41:54,353
On screen,

838
00:41:54,437 --> 00:41:56,942
images 62 to 65, inclusive.

839
00:41:57,026 --> 00:42:01,256
Crime scene photographs
of PC Ryan Pilkington's body.

840
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:03,930
How did Ryan Pilkington
meet his death?

841
00:42:04,033 --> 00:42:05,691

Document 60 in your folders.

843
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:11,059
Document 60
is the forensic pathologist's

844
00:42:11,143 --> 00:42:13,821
post-mortem report
on Ryan Pilkington.

845
00:42:13,905 --> 00:42:16,962
Cause of death was two
gunshot wounds to the chest.

846
00:42:17,046 --> 00:42:20,586
At post-mortem, two Parabellum
9/19mm rounds

847
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:22,692
were recovered
from the thoracic cavity.

848
00:42:22,776 --> 00:42:26,385
Ryan Pilkington was fatally
wounded by a firearm.

849
00:42:26,469 --> 00:42:28,472
Describe what happened.

DI Arnott.

00:42:41,173 --> 00:42:43,142
DI Arnott.

853
00:42:46,627 --> 00:42:49,270
Document 78 in your folders.

854
00:42:49,354 --> 00:42:52,169
Document 78 is a report
issued by neighbours

855
00:42:52,253 --> 00:42:54,585
on the 24th of November, 2020.

856
00:42:54,669 --> 00:42:57,363
Please refer to page two,
paragraph six.

857
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,176
Both Parabellum rounds

858
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:00,799
recovered from the deceased
show markings

859
00:43:00,883 --> 00:43:03,594
consistent with being fired
from a Glock 17 pistol,

860
00:43:03,678 --> 00:43:07,150
serial number 2-7-7-5-3-1.

861
00:43:07,234 --> 00:43:10,532
2-7-7-5-3-1 is the firearm
lawfully issued

862
00:43:10,616 --> 00:43:12,707
on the 20th of November, 2020

863
00:43:12,791 --> 00:43:15,278
to Detective Inspector
Kate Fleming.

864
00:43:16,691 --> 00:43:18,437
Fingerprints matching
DI Fleming

865
00:43:18,521 --> 00:43:22,285
were also detected
on 2-7-7-5-3-1.

866
00:43:23,077 --> 00:43:26,254
Did DI Fleming shoot dead
Ryan Pilkington?

867
00:43:31,845 --> 00:43:33,503
No.

868
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:36,506
No?

869
00:43:38,127 --> 00:43:39,992
Who, then?

870
00:43:41,924 --> 00:43:43,409
I did.

871
00:43:46,066 --> 00:43:47,862
Hmm.

872
00:43:48,758 --> 00:43:50,607
That doesn't square
with the forensic evidence,

873
00:43:50,691 --> 00:43:52,141
I'm afraid.

874
00:43:52,727 --> 00:43:55,370
Naturally, Kate's prints
were on the firearm.

875
00:43:55,454 --> 00:43:56,889
She'd handled it repeatedly.

876
00:43:56,973 --> 00:43:59,805
But you'll also have found
my prints on the firearm.

877
00:44:00,011 --> 00:44:01,445
That's correct. We did.

878
00:44:01,529 --> 00:44:04,154
Because she was forced
to hand it over to me.

879
00:44:04,947 --> 00:44:07,313
Ryan had her at gunpoint.

880
00:44:07,397 --> 00:44:10,194
I turned Kate's firearm
on Ryan.

881
00:44:12,782 --> 00:44:15,287
At the time of your arrest,
Fleming had her firearm.

882
00:44:15,371 --> 00:44:17,167
You had Pilkington's.

883
00:44:17,338 --> 00:44:19,463
I returned Kate's firearm.

884
00:44:19,547 --> 00:44:21,309
I picked up Ryan's.

885
00:44:21,998 --> 00:44:24,572
Forensic analysis of clothing
worn by DI Fleming

886
00:44:24,656 --> 00:44:27,195
detected a dense distribution
of gunshot residue

887
00:44:27,279 --> 00:44:28,576
on the right-hand sleeve,

888
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:30,509
a finding commonly associated

889
00:44:30,593 --> 00:44:33,770
with the discharging
of a firearm.

890
00:44:34,942 --> 00:44:37,999
Kate was in the process
of handing me the firearm.

891
00:44:38,083 --> 00:44:40,105
When I turned the firearm
on Ryan

892
00:44:40,189 --> 00:44:42,521
and discharged
the fatal shots.

893
00:44:42,605 --> 00:44:45,713
Kate's sleeve absorbed
the gunshot powder.

894
00:44:45,884 --> 00:44:47,922
Joanne Davidson.

895
00:44:48,197 --> 00:44:50,011
To be clear,

896
00:44:50,095 --> 00:44:51,219
you are confessing

897
00:44:51,303 --> 00:44:53,962
to the murder
of Ryan Pilkington,

898
00:44:54,928 --> 00:44:56,827
No, ma'am.

899
00:44:57,413 --> 00:45:00,332
Pilkington was about to fire
on DI Fleming.

900
00:45:00,416 --> 00:45:01,471
At the time of the incident,

901
00:45:01,555 --> 00:45:03,749
I was a serving
police officer.

902
00:45:03,833 --> 00:45:08,374
Under common law section three
of the Criminal Law Act 1967,

903
00:45:08,458 --> 00:45:09,617
and Section 117

904
00:45:09,701 --> 00:45:12,551
of the Police and Criminal
Evidence Act 1984,

905
00:45:12,635 --> 00:45:14,760
I am permitted
to employ lethal force

906
00:45:14,844 --> 00:45:17,521
to prevent
an imminent threat to life.

907
00:45:17,605 --> 00:45:19,385
My colleague
was acting lawfully.

908
00:45:19,469 --> 00:45:22,301
I think you'll find
that's for a court to decide.

909
00:45:26,097 --> 00:45:28,601
You weren't in league
with Pilkington?

910
00:45:28,685 --> 00:45:32,674
Ryan Pilkington was imposed
on MIT against my will.

911
00:45:32,758 --> 00:45:35,970
I was fully aware
of his OCG connections.

912
00:45:36,417 --> 00:45:38,128
He was there to intimidate me

913
00:45:38,212 --> 00:45:40,940
into misleading
Operation Lighthouse.

914
00:45:43,769 --> 00:45:46,067
So, who was giving
Pilkington his orders?

915
00:45:46,151 --> 00:45:47,844
Was it Marcus Thurwell?

916
00:45:49,154 --> 00:45:50,416
No comment.

917
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:52,556
We have presented
clear evidence

918
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:55,283
that you were getting
your instructions from Spain.

919
00:45:55,367 --> 00:45:56,457
We also know
from our inquiries

920
00:45:56,541 --> 00:45:58,441
that Thurwell was in Spain.

921
00:45:59,268 --> 00:46:02,306
Is this the person
running the show? Yes?

922
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:04,085
No comment.

923
00:46:04,169 --> 00:46:06,812
Marcus Thurwell was SIO

924
00:46:06,896 --> 00:46:09,021
in the Lawrence Christopher
murder inquiry.

925
00:46:09,105 --> 00:46:10,160
Now, we believe

926
00:46:10,244 --> 00:46:13,370
that he deliberately
misled that inquiry

927
00:46:13,454 --> 00:46:16,201
to protect Darren Hunter,
Tommy Hunter's son,

928
00:46:16,285 --> 00:46:19,703
on the expressed orders
of Tommy Hunter.

929
00:46:20,668 --> 00:46:22,034
No comment.

930
00:46:22,118 --> 00:46:23,311
Lawrence Christopher,

931
00:46:23,395 --> 00:46:25,555
he was an architect.
He was a model citizen,

932
00:46:25,639 --> 00:46:28,592
he had his head smashed in
with a piece of lead piping

933
00:46:28,676 --> 00:46:30,629
by a bunch of racist thugs,

934
00:46:30,713 --> 00:46:32,596
one of whom was your cousin.

935
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:34,805
Superintendent, your
questioning is oppressive.

936
00:46:34,889 --> 00:46:36,339
I'll give you oppressive.

937
00:46:36,891 --> 00:46:37,877
Look, that lad had
his whole life ahead of him,

938
00:46:37,961 --> 00:46:39,689
just like Gail Vella.

939
00:46:42,069 --> 00:46:44,263
They both died
horrible deaths.

940
00:46:44,347 --> 00:46:46,507
I dread to imagine
what they suffered.

941
00:46:46,591 --> 00:46:49,096
Yes. Well, then
give them justice.

942
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:51,459
Tell us
who's giving the orders.

943
00:46:52,183 --> 00:46:53,755
I can't.

944
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:54,756
I'm sorry.

945
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:56,310
Is it Thurwell?
Is it someone else?

946
00:46:56,394 --> 00:46:58,415
- It is Osborne?
- I think we'll leave it there.

947
00:46:58,499 --> 00:47:00,762
Is it the Chief Constable?

948
00:47:00,846 --> 00:47:04,352
Thank you,
Superintendent Hastings.

949
00:47:04,436 --> 00:47:07,164
Joanne Davidson, do you have
anything further to say?

950
00:47:07,888 --> 00:47:09,737
No.

951
00:47:09,821 --> 00:47:11,359
Joanne Davidson,
I've been in consultation

952
00:47:11,443 --> 00:47:13,499
with the senior prosecutor
at the Complex Case Unit.

953
00:47:13,583 --> 00:47:15,329
Nothing you have disclosed
during this interview

954
00:47:15,413 --> 00:47:16,744
has impacted
on those discussions,

955
00:47:16,828 --> 00:47:19,264
and, therefore,
I am authorised to charge you

956
00:47:19,348 --> 00:47:20,713
with the following offences.

957
00:47:20,797 --> 00:47:22,129
Perverting the course
of justice

958
00:47:22,213 --> 00:47:23,820
and malfeasance
in a public office.

959
00:47:23,904 --> 00:47:26,547
I will consult further
regarding conspiracy

960
00:47:26,631 --> 00:47:29,205
to murder DI Kate Fleming

961
00:47:29,289 --> 00:47:31,897
and any charges
relating to the death

962
00:47:31,981 --> 00:47:33,381
of PC Ryan Pilkington.

963
00:47:33,465 --> 00:47:35,883
You will be remanded
in custody.

964
00:47:36,365 --> 00:47:40,922
Interview terminated at 11:43.

965
00:47:44,614 --> 00:47:46,187
You take care
of the custody, son,

966
00:47:46,271 --> 00:47:48,136
just leave this one to me.

967
00:47:57,317 --> 00:47:59,044
I'm sorry.

968
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:02,426
Yeah. Me too.

969
00:48:09,191 --> 00:48:10,694
You and I both know
that Jo Davidson's

970
00:48:10,778 --> 00:48:13,628
the best chance we ever had
of blowing wide open

971
00:48:13,712 --> 00:48:15,423
the network
of corrupt police officers

972
00:48:15,507 --> 00:48:18,081
in league
with organised crime.

973
00:48:18,165 --> 00:48:19,807
I must have been in
another interview,

974
00:48:19,891 --> 00:48:21,705
because every other answer
I heard was, "No comment."

975
00:48:21,789 --> 00:48:23,742
You let her
off the hook, ma'am.

976
00:48:23,826 --> 00:48:25,537
And as for shutting down
all my questions

977
00:48:25,621 --> 00:48:27,849
- about the fourth man...
- Superintendent.

978
00:48:27,933 --> 00:48:30,680
You are bitter about AC-12
being merged. Who wouldn't be?

979
00:48:30,764 --> 00:48:32,337
It's got nothing
to do with that.

980
00:48:32,421 --> 00:48:34,373
Inquiries into Jo Davidson
will continue.

981
00:48:34,457 --> 00:48:37,807
She has more to reveal.
We will get there in time.

982
00:48:39,290 --> 00:48:41,120
I don't have time.

983
00:49:18,984 --> 00:49:20,746
Sir?

984
00:49:21,953 --> 00:49:26,269
Sometimes you
don't lose, son,

985
00:49:27,545 --> 00:49:29,962
you just run out of time.

986
00:49:40,696 --> 00:49:42,181
As you were.

987
00:49:47,875 --> 00:49:49,379
The Crown Prosecutor
is gullible enough

988
00:49:49,463 --> 00:49:52,037
to consider proceedings
against Jo Davidson alone

989
00:49:52,121 --> 00:49:54,331
in the death
of Ryan Pilkington.

990
00:49:54,917 --> 00:49:56,955
Thank you very much, ma'am.

991
00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:04,065
Two shots to the chest,

992
00:50:04,271 --> 00:50:06,465
double tap. Mm.

993
00:50:06,549 --> 00:50:09,036
Like a firearms-
trained officer.

994
00:50:11,382 --> 00:50:14,766
Davidson's not
firearms trained, is she?

995
00:50:16,318 --> 00:50:18,493
You are, though,
aren't you, Kate?

996
00:50:19,321 --> 00:50:21,151
That's correct, ma'am.

997
00:50:24,498 --> 00:50:27,314
So you'll provide a first
account for my, er, team

998
00:50:27,398 --> 00:50:29,263
and then you're free to go.

999
00:50:32,126 --> 00:50:34,233
I'm not gullible, Kate.

1000
00:50:36,130 --> 00:50:38,134
But I am pragmatic.

1001
00:51:03,261 --> 00:51:04,885
All right?

1002
00:51:05,919 --> 00:51:07,077
All right.

1003
00:51:07,161 --> 00:51:08,631
Thought we'd got rid of you.

1004
00:51:08,715 --> 00:51:10,856
No such luck.

1005
00:51:11,787 --> 00:51:13,291
You sure you're OK?

1006
00:51:13,375 --> 00:51:14,464
I know
nobody's coming after you

1007
00:51:14,548 --> 00:51:15,741
over Ryan Pilkington's
shooting.

1008
00:51:15,825 --> 00:51:18,070
If you ever need
to talk about it...

1009
00:51:18,932 --> 00:51:22,247
Thanks, mate.
I appreciate it, but I'm fine.

1010
00:51:22,763 --> 00:51:24,854
So what did you
get out of Jo?

1011
00:51:24,938 --> 00:51:26,907
A lot less than we needed.

1012
00:51:27,630 --> 00:51:30,169
Did she say anything
about her family history?

1013
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:31,723
She told me
her dad was a police officer.

1014
00:51:31,807 --> 00:51:34,121
No. Never even gave us
that much.

1015
00:51:34,396 --> 00:51:35,692
She's scared, Steve.

1016
00:51:35,776 --> 00:51:38,523
After what happened
to Tommy, Lakewell,

1017
00:51:38,607 --> 00:51:40,628
never mind John Corbett.

1018
00:51:40,712 --> 00:51:42,699
That's why we've got her
on the VPU apprentice,

1019
00:51:42,783 --> 00:51:45,753
security cameras
monitoring access to her cell.

1020
00:51:46,856 --> 00:51:48,376
So, what now?

1021
00:51:49,376 --> 00:51:53,089
Well, we're into the forensics
at the OCG workshop.

1022
00:51:53,173 --> 00:51:54,470
And as I'm
the senior detective

1023
00:51:54,554 --> 00:51:56,265
left on Operation Lighthouse,

1024
00:51:56,349 --> 00:51:57,438
I could be
the point of contact

1025
00:51:57,522 --> 00:51:59,940
between MIT and AC-12.

1026
00:52:00,422 --> 00:52:02,029
Works for me, mate.

1027
00:52:02,113 --> 00:52:03,444
Let's get this job done.

1028
00:52:03,528 --> 00:52:05,083
- I'll drive.
- I'll drive.

1029
00:52:08,533 --> 00:52:11,107
It'll be in the Red Lion
by 8:00. Nice work.

1030
00:52:11,191 --> 00:52:12,384
All right, Chris.

1031
00:52:12,468 --> 00:52:14,800
- Ma'am.
- You remember DI Arnott.

1032
00:52:14,884 --> 00:52:16,768
Sir.

1033
00:52:16,852 --> 00:52:19,925
Don't act like a tit, sarge.
We're all in it together.

1034
00:52:21,166 --> 00:52:22,825
What have you found?

1035
00:52:24,135 --> 00:52:27,296
There's strong evidence
of workshop in the firearms.

1036
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:29,159
Neighbours have given
a preliminary report

1037
00:52:29,243 --> 00:52:31,369
of matches between
the machinery here

1038
00:52:31,453 --> 00:52:32,611
and the markings
on the firearms

1039
00:52:32,695 --> 00:52:34,889
used in the Jimmy Lakewell
ambush.

1040
00:52:34,973 --> 00:52:37,616
Forensics have harvested
prints and DNA,

1041
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:40,032
just waiting on the lab
for any matches.

1042
00:52:40,116 --> 00:52:41,965
FC thinks
they've covered the ground.

1043
00:52:42,049 --> 00:52:43,070
I'm gonna call off

1044
00:52:43,154 --> 00:52:44,761
the forensic deployment
tonight.

1045
00:52:44,845 --> 00:52:46,987
Now, you look
at the weight of those.

1046
00:52:47,192 --> 00:52:48,489
No way were two OCG men

1047
00:52:48,573 --> 00:52:50,369
on their own
gonna move 'em.

1048
00:52:50,506 --> 00:52:52,459
What was in their van?

1049
00:52:52,543 --> 00:52:55,236
Tarpaulins and rope.

1050
00:52:56,512 --> 00:52:58,534
Couple of pickaxes,
bolt cutters,

1051
00:52:58,618 --> 00:53:00,156
a couple of wrenches,

1052
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:02,434
socket set, Stanley knives.

1053
00:53:02,518 --> 00:53:07,007
Power tools, including
power saws and power drills.

1054
00:53:07,385 --> 00:53:08,923
Right.
Let's call out the GPR.

1055
00:53:09,007 --> 00:53:10,737
Find out
what's under that floor.

1056
00:53:10,871 --> 00:53:12,944
- Really?
- Yeah, really,

1057
00:53:17,844 --> 00:53:21,711
Sorry, mate. My DI's
requested GPR for wirework.

1058
00:53:33,273 --> 00:53:34,363
Chloe.

1059
00:53:34,447 --> 00:53:36,450
Sir, we think
we've found Thurwell.

1060
00:53:37,311 --> 00:53:39,091
We'll be right there.

1061
00:53:39,175 --> 00:53:41,248
They've located
Marcus Thurwell.

1062
00:53:41,971 --> 00:53:43,836
Let's go.

1063
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:04,116
Ah, Kate. Steve.

1064
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,394
Spanish authorities
are helping us

1065
00:54:05,478 --> 00:54:07,223
in our efforts
to apprehend Thurwell.

1066
00:54:07,307 --> 00:54:09,294
The Guardia Civil
have received intel

1067
00:54:09,378 --> 00:54:11,041
on this particular address.

1068
00:55:09,334 --> 00:55:11,550
Name of God
and his holy mother...

1069
00:55:17,446 --> 00:55:20,002
Two dead, sir.
Male plus female.

1070
00:55:27,525 --> 00:55:28,960
Thank you, Captain.

1071
00:55:29,044 --> 00:55:30,499
We'll leave
the rest to you.

1072
00:55:41,643 --> 00:55:44,941
It's just... It's another
kick in the teeth.

1073
00:55:45,025 --> 00:55:47,270
Only so much
a man can take!

1074
00:56:33,833 --> 00:56:35,353
Wait there, please.

1075
00:56:52,265 --> 00:56:54,855
Sorry. Wrong way.

1076
00:56:55,544 --> 00:56:58,203
God, this place is a maze.

1077
