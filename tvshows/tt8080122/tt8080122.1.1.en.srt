2
00:00:16,799 --> 00:00:19,889
See you on the outside, Bumpy!

3
00:00:26,896 --> 00:00:28,854
Get the fuck outta here!

4
00:00:28,941 --> 00:00:30,639
Fuck you, too, man!

5
00:00:51,355 --> 00:00:54,445
So much has changed in Harlem
since you've been gone.

6
00:00:54,532 --> 00:00:56,839
Bad and good.

7
00:00:56,926 --> 00:00:59,059
A lot of folks moved out
to Brooklyn and Queens.

8
00:00:59,146 --> 00:01:00,973
They don't feel safe here anymore.

9
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,975
Leeds Department Store
went out of business.

10
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,151
Can you imagine that?

11
00:01:04,238 --> 00:01:05,674
No.

12
00:01:05,761 --> 00:01:07,850
Remember how we used to
buy your shoes there?

13
00:01:07,937 --> 00:01:10,157
Yeah.

14
00:01:10,244 --> 00:01:11,984
Apollo still there.

15
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:14,726
As long as there's a Harlem,
we'll have the Apollo.

16
00:01:14,813 --> 00:01:16,293
Who's James Brown?

17
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:20,210
A singer... talented.

18
00:01:20,297 --> 00:01:23,213
Maybe we'll go see him sometime.

19
00:01:26,042 --> 00:01:29,524
I just know you'll get right
back into the swing of things.

20
00:01:31,613 --> 00:01:33,789
Looking at you...

21
00:01:33,876 --> 00:01:37,880
I'm already back
into the swing of things.

22
00:02:14,699 --> 00:02:17,224
I tried to imagine it
from your letters.

23
00:02:17,311 --> 00:02:21,750
Man, to see it for real, it's...

24
00:02:21,837 --> 00:02:23,839
it's modern, alright.

25
00:02:33,805 --> 00:02:36,417
We needed a fresh start.

26
00:02:40,899 --> 00:02:42,945
Afternoon, Mr. Booker.

27
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,346
Welcome home, Daddy.

28
00:02:52,433 --> 00:02:54,739
I'm home for good.

29
00:02:54,826 --> 00:02:56,350
There's the man of the hour!

30
00:02:56,437 --> 00:02:57,960
Yeah, Bumpy!

31
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:03,574
Guap, they didn't tell me you was here, man.
Bumpy.

32
00:03:03,661 --> 00:03:05,924
Thanks for coming out, man.
I really appreciate it.

33
00:03:06,011 --> 00:03:07,796
And I appreciate what you did
for my family, alright?

34
00:03:07,883 --> 00:03:09,276
The Italians...

35
00:03:09,363 --> 00:03:12,409
They're creating a problem
for us, Bumpy.

36
00:03:12,496 --> 00:03:14,542
We so glad you back.
But Mayme's more glad.

37
00:03:14,629 --> 00:03:15,978
I mean, she won't say,

38
00:03:16,065 --> 00:03:17,806
but she missed you
something awful.

39
00:03:17,893 --> 00:03:20,200
And Charlie
just got into Morehouse.

40
00:03:20,287 --> 00:03:22,289
We a little short on funds,
but, you know --

41
00:03:22,376 --> 00:03:24,552
- I'll see what I can do, alright?
- Thank you.

42
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:26,293
I got a line on a dozen
.38 Colt Longs,

43
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:29,296
three Browning Automatics,
and them boys got some kick.

44
00:03:29,383 --> 00:03:31,254
Margaret's doing
so well in school.

45
00:03:31,341 --> 00:03:32,255
She's really smart?

46
00:03:32,342 --> 00:03:33,387
Exceptional.

47
00:03:33,474 --> 00:03:35,040
And...'course,

48
00:03:35,127 --> 00:03:36,477
the roof in the rectory
is leaking.

49
00:03:36,564 --> 00:03:38,435
I got an idea.

50
00:03:38,522 --> 00:03:39,784
I got a car wash
on 112th street --

51
00:03:39,871 --> 00:03:41,569
this car wash
on 112th street.

52
00:03:41,656 --> 00:03:43,135
Bumpy: Why are you starting
a new business right now?

53
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,442
Man: You look good.
Prison agrees with you, man.

54
00:03:45,529 --> 00:03:48,271
- Good to see you, brother.
- Good to see you, Bumpy.

55
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,702
Daddy?

56
00:04:45,502 --> 00:04:47,678
Daddy?

57
00:04:47,765 --> 00:04:49,506
Are you okay?

58
00:04:49,593 --> 00:04:52,335
I'm fine. Come here!
Come here, come here.

59
00:04:52,422 --> 00:04:53,423
Give me a hug.

60
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:02,780
You want some ice cream?
Wanna go get a split?

61
00:05:02,867 --> 00:05:03,955
A split.

62
00:05:04,042 --> 00:05:05,957
Yeah.

63
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:12,399
We got a problem
up on 46th.

64
00:05:12,486 --> 00:05:15,358
Alright.

65
00:05:15,445 --> 00:05:17,708
- We'll do that later, okay?
- Alright.

66
00:05:17,795 --> 00:05:19,536
Okay.

67
00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:51,438
Welcome home, Bumpy.

68
00:05:51,525 --> 00:05:53,788
I'm sorry you gotta come
back to all this shit.

69
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:56,268
What happened?

70
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,966
They came in
from the back,

71
00:05:58,053 --> 00:06:00,447
turned this place out
like a $5 ho.

72
00:06:00,534 --> 00:06:01,926
Dexter stepped up...

73
00:06:02,013 --> 00:06:03,580
so they capped him.

74
00:06:03,667 --> 00:06:05,800
Who did it?

75
00:06:05,887 --> 00:06:07,454
Some dark-haired
motherfucking guinea

76
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:08,890
named Zambrano.

77
00:06:08,977 --> 00:06:11,849
Zambrano?
That's Chin Gigante's crew.

78
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,475
You gon' be able
to tough this out?

79
00:06:28,562 --> 00:06:32,217
Yes, sir.

80
00:06:32,304 --> 00:06:35,046
Is Sister Helen
still at St. Mary's?

81
00:06:35,133 --> 00:06:36,700
You take him over there.

82
00:06:36,787 --> 00:06:38,398
You tell 'em that Dexter's
a part of my crew.

83
00:06:38,485 --> 00:06:40,443
You got it.

84
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:42,489
You'll be alright.

85
00:06:42,576 --> 00:06:44,316
Now you got a story to tell
all these ladies.

86
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,974
See he gets anything he needs.

87
00:06:50,061 --> 00:06:53,413
I'm-a get a crew in here
to clean this place up, alright?

88
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,457
It's good to see you.

89
00:06:54,544 --> 00:06:56,546
See you, too.

90
00:06:56,633 --> 00:06:58,418
Let's go.

91
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,209
Bumpy: Who is this guinea
that this kid's talking about?

92
00:07:07,296 --> 00:07:08,776
Zambrano.

93
00:07:08,863 --> 00:07:11,605
He's running Harlem
for the Genovese family.

94
00:07:11,692 --> 00:07:14,477
He muscled in
on numbers, women, dope.

95
00:07:14,564 --> 00:07:18,786
But till now,
he left your spots alone.

96
00:07:18,873 --> 00:07:22,833
Tell you this, we ain't
do nothing to bring it on.

97
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,532
The Italians are
sending us a message.

98
00:07:25,619 --> 00:07:28,317
Cecil still shine shoes
over on 37th?

99
00:07:28,404 --> 00:07:31,625
That old coot --
He'll be there till he's 100.

100
00:07:31,712 --> 00:07:33,453
Lay a dime on him.

101
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,542
Make sure he gets us
the wherefore on Zambrano.

102
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:38,240
That cop D'Alessandro,

103
00:07:38,327 --> 00:07:39,894
he still at the 28th?

104
00:07:39,981 --> 00:07:42,026
Nah, nah, he went
to narcotics.

105
00:07:42,113 --> 00:07:43,550
We need to put
more cops on the pad,

106
00:07:43,637 --> 00:07:45,552
make sure this
never happens again.

107
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:47,684
You got it.

108
00:07:51,732 --> 00:07:53,864
Take me to Pleasant Avenue.

109
00:07:57,607 --> 00:07:59,304
You know, they still
don't take too kindly

110
00:07:59,391 --> 00:08:01,393
to colored folks
in East Harlem.

111
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,656
Last six blocks of the old country

112
00:08:02,743 --> 00:08:04,658
they got up here.

113
00:08:04,745 --> 00:08:06,660
You know what they call Negroes...

114
00:08:06,747 --> 00:08:08,575
on Pleasant Avenue?

115
00:08:08,662 --> 00:08:09,706
What?

116
00:08:09,793 --> 00:08:11,578
Dead.

117
00:08:11,665 --> 00:08:13,797
We'll see.

118
00:08:13,884 --> 00:08:15,799
<i>WLIB is proud
to present the discussion</i>

119
00:08:15,886 --> 00:08:17,627
<i>between Congressman
Adam Clayton Powell Jr.</i>

120
00:08:17,714 --> 00:08:19,586
<i>and Minister Malcolm X from the Nation --</i>

121
00:08:19,673 --> 00:08:21,065
Turn it up.

122
00:08:21,152 --> 00:08:23,285
<i>Congressmen Powell,</i>

123
00:08:23,372 --> 00:08:25,766
<i>how should Negroes respond
to police brutality?</i>

124
00:08:25,853 --> 00:08:29,291
<i>Non violence demands
that the means we use</i>

125
00:08:29,378 --> 00:08:31,946
<i>must be as peaceful
as the ends we seek.</i>

126
00:08:32,033 --> 00:08:34,078
- Negroes want our rights.
- Yeah.

127
00:08:34,165 --> 00:08:37,081
<i>Minister Malcolm, I got my rights right here.</i>

128
00:08:37,168 --> 00:08:39,214
<i>To accuse us of violence</i>

129
00:08:39,301 --> 00:08:41,390
<i>is like accusing the man
who is being lynched</i>

130
00:08:41,477 --> 00:08:44,132
<i>simply because he struggles vigorously 
against his lyncher.</i>

131
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:46,177
I knew that cat
before he changed his name,

132
00:08:46,264 --> 00:08:48,092
before he got that "X."

133
00:08:48,179 --> 00:08:49,703
We got history,
him and me.

143

He said up, motherfuckers!Move. Move. Move!

144
00:09:17,861 --> 00:09:19,733
Move!

145
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:22,126
What the fuck
you looking at?

146
00:10:32,588 --> 00:10:34,851
Yeah. Kilos in the carcass.

147
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:43,294
Easy with that.

148
00:10:43,381 --> 00:10:44,774
Jimmy, how we looking?

149
00:10:44,861 --> 00:10:46,863
Looking good, boss.

150
00:11:04,838 --> 00:11:07,492
How's the quality on this batch?

151
00:11:07,579 --> 00:11:08,929
What we looking at?

152
00:11:11,801 --> 00:11:14,325
I'd say 96% pure.

153
00:11:18,895 --> 00:11:20,854
Who the fuck are you?

154
00:11:20,941 --> 00:11:22,682
Where's Chin?

155
00:11:22,769 --> 00:11:24,161
If you're here
to steal our dope,

156
00:11:24,248 --> 00:11:26,381
you won't get off
this block alive.

157
00:11:26,468 --> 00:11:28,513
Get Chin or I'll blow
your fucking head off.

158
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,777
I'm a made man.

159
00:11:30,864 --> 00:11:33,040
Yeah?You got some fucking nerve.

160
00:11:33,127 --> 00:11:34,781
There you are.

161
00:11:34,868 --> 00:11:36,957
What balls you got, 
coming in here with a shotgun?

162
00:11:37,044 --> 00:11:39,742
Hey, this is Bumpy Johnson.
He's a legend.

163
00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:42,963
He took on Dutch Schultz
back in the day.

164
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:44,486
This is Richie Zambrano.

165
00:11:44,573 --> 00:11:45,922
He's my capo.
He come down from Detroit.

166
00:11:46,009 --> 00:11:47,532
He's my cousin.

167
00:11:47,619 --> 00:11:49,404
You the guy
who knee-capped that kid?

168
00:11:49,491 --> 00:11:50,927
He's never gonna walk again.
You know that, right?

169
00:11:51,014 --> 00:11:52,363
That's too bad.

170
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:53,887
You backwards
guinea motherfucker.

171
00:11:53,974 --> 00:11:56,106
What'd you
come here for?

172
00:11:56,193 --> 00:11:57,934
You know why I'm here.

173
00:11:58,021 --> 00:11:59,980
That's why you sent this goombah
by to hit my spot.

174
00:12:00,067 --> 00:12:01,851
That was a warning shot,

175
00:12:01,938 --> 00:12:04,636
make sure you stay
in your place.

176
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:08,510
You used to be Vito's driver
before I left.

177
00:12:08,597 --> 00:12:13,645
And now you're the boss.
Okay...boss.

178
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:16,779
I get a cut of everything
from 110th to 160th,

179
00:12:16,866 --> 00:12:18,215
just the way it was before.

180
00:12:18,302 --> 00:12:20,174
No.

181
00:12:20,261 --> 00:12:23,743
Richie Zambrano,
he runs Harlem for me now.

182
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:25,832
Harlem's mine.

183
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:29,009
Times have changed.

184
00:12:29,096 --> 00:12:30,358
I haven't.

185
00:14:36,223 --> 00:14:37,920
You look so good.

186
00:14:38,007 --> 00:14:39,269
You just...

187
00:14:39,356 --> 00:14:41,532
God, I missed you.

188
00:14:46,146 --> 00:14:47,060
What?

189
00:14:47,147 --> 00:14:49,932
You fired a gun tonight.

190
00:14:50,019 --> 00:14:52,021
Not <i>at</i>nobody.

191
00:14:56,808 --> 00:14:58,419
Baby, we gotta talk.

192
00:14:58,506 --> 00:15:00,247
How you expect me to talk
with you looking like this?

193
00:15:00,334 --> 00:15:03,076
I think you ever wanna come home
to this again,

194
00:15:03,163 --> 00:15:06,296
you best start talking.

195
00:15:06,383 --> 00:15:08,908
Look, you don't wanna say
nothing out there

196
00:15:08,995 --> 00:15:11,823
because you gotta be strong
for your men, I see that.

197
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,000
That's how
it's gotta be.

198
00:15:14,087 --> 00:15:17,133
But in here,
you are gonna be real,

199
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:19,353
and you are
gonna talk to me.

200
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,530
Alright.

201
00:15:22,617 --> 00:15:25,968
What you wanna
talk about?

202
00:15:26,055 --> 00:15:29,841
Baby, nobody does that time
and comes out fine.

203
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,626
So, I want you
to talk to me

204
00:15:31,713 --> 00:15:33,149
about how
they locked you in a cage

205
00:15:33,236 --> 00:15:36,152
like an animal.

206
00:15:36,239 --> 00:15:38,720
That is what
I wanna talk about.

207
00:15:38,807 --> 00:15:41,592
Baby...
Baby, we don't...

208
00:15:43,725 --> 00:15:48,121
We could talk about that
some other time.

209
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:52,429
Well, you don't touch me
until you say it.

210
00:15:58,087 --> 00:16:02,135
They locked me in a cage.

211
00:16:02,222 --> 00:16:05,138
And?

212
00:16:07,879 --> 00:16:11,144
And I was alone.

213
00:16:11,231 --> 00:16:14,060
What else?

214
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:30,076
I was scared.

215
00:16:30,163 --> 00:16:32,208
Of what?

216
00:16:36,082 --> 00:16:38,345
Dying alone in the dark.

217
00:16:41,957 --> 00:16:44,090
Not being able
to come back.

218
00:16:47,441 --> 00:16:49,573
Losing...

219
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,662
you.

220
00:16:58,452 --> 00:17:02,369
Baby, we have got
a lot to lose.

221
00:17:02,456 --> 00:17:05,807
And I need you to control
your temper.

222
00:17:05,894 --> 00:17:07,635
I'm trying, babe.

223
00:17:07,722 --> 00:17:09,463
Trying.

224
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:11,595
I'm trying.

225
00:17:28,743 --> 00:17:31,093
Check.

226
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:34,444
That fucking guy.

227
00:17:34,531 --> 00:17:36,142
I knew Chin would ask you
to go to the Families

228
00:17:36,229 --> 00:17:39,275
for permission to kill me
after what I did.

229
00:17:39,362 --> 00:17:41,103
It was very bold.

230
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:43,845
And reckless.

231
00:17:43,932 --> 00:17:46,891
Before I got sent away,
I got a cut of everything

232
00:17:46,978 --> 00:17:49,720
you guys did
from 110th to 160th.

233
00:17:49,807 --> 00:17:53,072
I'm putting things back
the way they were, Frank.

234
00:17:53,159 --> 00:17:55,291
Good luck with it, yeah?

235
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:00,731
It's your move.

236
00:18:11,351 --> 00:18:14,963
Costello's here.

237
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:18,140
Let the games begin.

238
00:18:18,227 --> 00:18:19,489
If it ain't
The Prime Minister.

239
00:18:19,576 --> 00:18:21,187
Chin.

240
00:18:22,797 --> 00:18:24,799
Sit down, sit down.

241
00:18:24,886 --> 00:18:25,887
Want an espresso?

242
00:18:25,974 --> 00:18:27,280
No, thanks.

243
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,632
What'd they say?

244
00:18:31,719 --> 00:18:35,375
I spoke to Lucchese,
Profaci, Bonanno, and Gambino.

245
00:18:35,462 --> 00:18:38,508
They are inclined
to give Bumpy a pass.

246
00:18:38,595 --> 00:18:41,816
You do not have a green light
to shoot this man.

247
00:18:41,903 --> 00:18:44,601
I can't kill a nigger
who fires a shotgun in my place?

248
00:18:44,688 --> 00:18:46,734
He went away
on a narcotics rap.

249
00:18:46,821 --> 00:18:48,301
He never snitched,

250
00:18:48,388 --> 00:18:50,694
even though it was our guys
who screwed it up.

251
00:18:50,781 --> 00:18:53,349
He understands the rules better
than some of our own,

252
00:18:53,436 --> 00:18:55,395
and the other bosses
like that.

253
00:18:55,482 --> 00:18:58,398
They like how
I lost 90 grand?

254
00:18:58,485 --> 00:19:01,749
Listen, you were lucky
to get hold of Harlem

255
00:19:01,836 --> 00:19:03,925
when the others thought
it was just pennies.

256
00:19:04,012 --> 00:19:05,318
I was lucky or smart?

257
00:19:05,405 --> 00:19:08,234
Well, heroin has
made it a gold mine.

258
00:19:08,321 --> 00:19:11,846
And now they're all itching
to get a piece of that pie.

259
00:19:11,933 --> 00:19:15,371
Why do you think Bumpy made
the move to Pleasant Avenue

260
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:19,332
when to be seen there
for a Negro is to be shot?

261
00:19:19,419 --> 00:19:22,552
He knew that
you'd come to me,

262
00:19:22,639 --> 00:19:26,774
I'd go to the Families,
he gets protection --

263
00:19:26,861 --> 00:19:30,299
brilliant.

264
00:19:30,386 --> 00:19:33,520
My advice is relax.

265
00:19:33,607 --> 00:19:37,654
He shot a cow,
for Christ's sake.

266
00:19:37,741 --> 00:19:39,961
Chin, be well.

267
00:19:40,048 --> 00:19:40,983
Yeah.

268
00:19:41,049 --> 00:19:42,790
Thank you, Costello.

269
00:19:55,542 --> 00:19:57,587
He still acts like
I'm Vito Genovese's driver.

270
00:19:59,546 --> 00:20:03,419
I got a mulignan Cuban in
Spic Town who could hit Johnson.

271
00:20:03,506 --> 00:20:04,899
Families would
know I did it.

272
00:20:04,986 --> 00:20:07,902
No. No, this guy's
purple-black.

273
00:20:07,989 --> 00:20:09,295
Just be one nigger
killing another.

274
00:20:09,382 --> 00:20:10,387
Happens every day.

275
00:20:10,426 --> 00:20:13,299
Richie...

276
00:20:13,386 --> 00:20:15,562
Johnson, he stopped a guy
from killing Costello

277
00:20:15,649 --> 00:20:18,173
when they were
doing time in Lewisburg.

278
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:23,134
I sent him to the Families

279
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:26,312
'cause I knew he'd vouch
for that rat-bastard.

280
00:20:26,399 --> 00:20:29,706
Why?

281
00:20:29,793 --> 00:20:32,361
'Cause every time
Costello spends

282
00:20:32,448 --> 00:20:36,409
one of his nigger-loving chips
with the Families,

283
00:20:36,496 --> 00:20:38,498
he gets weaker.

284
00:20:48,377 --> 00:20:52,425
Guineas are gonna come after us
for what you did last night.

285
00:20:52,512 --> 00:20:55,341
We need to be ready.

286
00:20:57,038 --> 00:20:58,735
Bump, all due respect,

287
00:20:58,822 --> 00:21:00,824
but they got a couple
of hundred soldiers.

288
00:21:00,911 --> 00:21:04,263
What are
we gonna do?

289
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:09,355
Enjoy breakfast.

290
00:21:15,448 --> 00:21:17,667
Detroit Red?

291
00:21:17,754 --> 00:21:19,495
Bumpy Johnson.

292
00:21:19,582 --> 00:21:21,454
Detroit Red.

293
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,373
What's happening, brother?
It's been a long time.

294
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:29,853
Somebody had told me
that the red-conked hustler

295
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,725
that I knew back at Small's

296
00:21:31,812 --> 00:21:33,770
was gonna end up on the cover
of <i>Life Magazine,</i>

297
00:21:33,857 --> 00:21:36,164
I would've told them
that they was crazy.

298
00:21:36,251 --> 00:21:38,297
Yeah, well,
the Honorable Elijah Muhammad

299
00:21:38,384 --> 00:21:39,950
opened my eyes, brother.

300
00:21:40,037 --> 00:21:41,517
Maybe he can do
the same for you.

301
00:21:41,604 --> 00:21:43,563
Brother. I ain't falling
for your new hustle.

302
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:45,391
Hey, this ain't
no hustle, man.

303
00:21:45,478 --> 00:21:47,393
I know you came up in here
to get some pork chops.

304
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,220
Hey, Henry?

305
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,918
Can you get him
a plate of pork chops?

306
00:21:51,005 --> 00:21:52,572
- Alright.
- Little apple sauce on the side.

307
00:21:52,659 --> 00:21:53,921
- I'm good. I'm good, Henry.
- Little cinnamon twist.

308
00:21:54,008 --> 00:21:56,358
Listen, brother,
pork is unclean,

309
00:21:56,445 --> 00:21:58,447
just like your mind.

310
00:22:00,449 --> 00:22:02,712
I heard you got out, brother.
How you been?

311
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:05,672
Young brother...
I done this before.

312
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:09,371
Yeah, you have.

313
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:11,155
Hey...

314
00:22:11,242 --> 00:22:13,984
You...

315
00:22:14,071 --> 00:22:18,249
You were the first to recognize
my deficiencies as a hustler.

316
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:22,123
I credit you with pushing me
toward the path of Islam.

317
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:24,125
That's the first time
anybody's accused me

318
00:22:24,212 --> 00:22:26,475
- of pushing 'em toward religion.
- I know it is.

319
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,436
But I believe in providence,
brother.

320
00:22:30,523 --> 00:22:32,438
Maybe that's...

321
00:22:32,525 --> 00:22:35,310
Maybe that's why I ran into you today.

322
00:22:37,007 --> 00:22:40,489
I got something
I want you to see.

323
00:22:44,537 --> 00:22:46,539
You know, back when I was hustling,

324
00:22:46,626 --> 00:22:48,149
only people into dope
were artists,

325
00:22:48,236 --> 00:22:50,847
musicians,
and hep cats.

326
00:22:50,934 --> 00:22:52,545
Now it's everywhere.

327
00:22:52,632 --> 00:22:55,374
Wasn't like this when I went away.

328
00:22:55,461 --> 00:22:58,159
More heroin comes out
of these four project towers

329
00:22:58,246 --> 00:23:00,030
than any other place
in Harlem.

330
00:23:00,117 --> 00:23:02,032
And if you're trying
to grow up here,

331
00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:04,470
it is a nightmare.

332
00:23:04,557 --> 00:23:06,428
Shutting down drug corners
where children grow up

333
00:23:06,515 --> 00:23:09,605
is the Nation's cause.

334
00:23:09,692 --> 00:23:12,086
Think if it was yours.

335
00:23:12,173 --> 00:23:13,653
Duji is duji, Malcolm.

336
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:17,178
It's a commodity.
It's like shoes or soap.

337
00:23:17,265 --> 00:23:19,310
You used to see it that way,
just like I do.

338
00:23:21,487 --> 00:23:23,489
I changed.

339
00:23:32,672 --> 00:23:35,326
The Genovese family
controls this spot.

340
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:37,677
Yeah, well,
I wanna shut it down.

341
00:23:37,764 --> 00:23:41,115
Yeah, that ain't
gon' be easy.

342
00:23:44,118 --> 00:23:46,599
You wanna shut the dope
down here?

343
00:23:46,686 --> 00:23:48,644
Yeah.

344
00:23:48,731 --> 00:23:53,780
But these Italians
have too many guns.

345
00:23:53,867 --> 00:23:55,521
If that's what
you need...

346
00:23:55,608 --> 00:23:58,437
I got guns.

347
00:24:02,223 --> 00:24:04,791
I got soldiers.

348
00:24:10,405 --> 00:24:12,712
Alright.

349
00:25:33,706 --> 00:25:36,360
Yeah, the white man
wants you to be high and drunk.

350
00:25:36,447 --> 00:25:38,275
He wants you to be
high and drunk

351
00:25:38,362 --> 00:25:40,364
the way some men try to get
a woman under the influence

352
00:25:40,451 --> 00:25:42,192
if they wanna
sleep with her.

353
00:25:42,279 --> 00:25:44,543
Brothers and sisters,
the struggle against this drug

354
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:46,632
is the struggle
for liberation.

355
00:26:03,736 --> 00:26:05,215
Let's go. 
It appears we have company.

356
00:26:05,302 --> 00:26:06,913
Get off of my spot!

357
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,610
All of you,
get off of my spot!

358
00:26:08,697 --> 00:26:11,439
Get out of here,
every one of youse!

359
00:26:11,526 --> 00:26:13,180
Right now!

360
00:26:15,878 --> 00:26:19,403
Every one of these men will die
for what they believe.

361
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:22,145
Your men willing
to do the same?

362
00:26:22,232 --> 00:26:23,799
You're all dead
right now!

363
00:26:23,886 --> 00:26:25,932
I'm looking at dead men,
every fucking one of youse.

364
00:26:26,019 --> 00:26:28,761
What took you so long?!

365
00:26:28,848 --> 00:26:32,460
I was getting bored!

366
00:26:32,547 --> 00:26:36,203
So was Chance...

367
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:38,074
Pettigrew,

368
00:26:38,161 --> 00:26:40,424
Richie,

369
00:26:40,511 --> 00:26:42,513
and Junie Byrd.

370
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:45,647
All of us,
bored shitless.

371
00:26:45,734 --> 00:26:48,171
Surprised to see me,

372
00:26:48,258 --> 00:26:50,652
Malcolm is
an old friend of mine.

373
00:26:50,739 --> 00:26:52,872
Malcolm, Chin used to
be a pretty good boxer

374
00:26:52,959 --> 00:26:54,787
back in the day,

375
00:26:54,874 --> 00:26:59,705
till this Negro kid I managed
just busted his ass up.

376
00:27:01,228 --> 00:27:03,012
He likes to play
the dumb bruiser.

377
00:27:03,099 --> 00:27:05,319
But that's just so the guineas
from the other Families

378
00:27:05,406 --> 00:27:07,060
underestimate him.

379
00:27:07,147 --> 00:27:10,977
But there's one thing
that you didn't count on.

380
00:27:11,064 --> 00:27:12,543
Me.

381
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:14,807
Yeah, you.

382
00:27:14,894 --> 00:27:17,026
You know that nobody
likes you people

383
00:27:17,113 --> 00:27:19,725
getting all loud
and boisterous, right?

384
00:27:21,378 --> 00:27:22,989
Isn't that a stereotype
that you don't want

385
00:27:23,076 --> 00:27:25,644
your people to have?

386
00:27:25,731 --> 00:27:29,778
Nothing goes down
from 110th to 160th

387
00:27:29,865 --> 00:27:31,084
unless I get my cut.

388
00:27:32,912 --> 00:27:36,002
Otherwise, I will
shut you down in Dunbar.

389
00:27:36,089 --> 00:27:38,526
I will shut you down in Jefferson.
Johnson.

390
00:27:38,613 --> 00:27:40,702
I will shut down
all of your spots,

391
00:27:40,789 --> 00:27:42,356
just like I did here.

392
00:27:42,443 --> 00:27:44,053
Bootlip shine,
I'll put you in the --

393
00:27:47,013 --> 00:27:48,710
Go ahead, go ahead!
Say fucking something else!

394
00:27:48,797 --> 00:27:50,146
You say something,
I'll cut your fucking throat!

395
00:27:50,233 --> 00:27:51,844
Hey, hey!
Hey, Johnson!

396
00:27:51,931 --> 00:27:53,672
- Say one more fucking word!
- Johnson, cut it out!

397
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:55,499
He's made!

398
00:27:55,586 --> 00:27:58,111
He's a made man.
They'll kill you.

399
00:27:58,198 --> 00:28:00,896
Right?

400
00:28:00,983 --> 00:28:02,506
You'll have every one
of the Families

401
00:28:02,593 --> 00:28:04,770
down on your head.

402
00:28:04,857 --> 00:28:06,902
Your wife and your kid
will be picking pieces of you

403
00:28:06,989 --> 00:28:12,342
out of the East River,
you know that.

404
00:28:12,429 --> 00:28:14,083
He's right, brother.

405
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:16,085
Think of your family.

406
00:28:16,172 --> 00:28:17,783
That's smart.

407
00:28:26,182 --> 00:28:27,401
Let's go.

408
00:28:27,488 --> 00:28:29,925
Turn around.

409
00:28:30,012 --> 00:28:32,319
Let's go.

410
00:28:49,292 --> 00:28:51,338
Hey, darling.

411
00:28:51,425 --> 00:28:54,297
There's someone here
who needs to talk to you.

412
00:28:54,384 --> 00:28:56,822
- Who?
- You remember my friend Delia?

413
00:28:56,909 --> 00:28:58,954
She used to hostess with me
down at Small's.

414
00:28:59,041 --> 00:29:00,913
Son's in some kind
of trouble.

415
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,872
Baby, I ain't got time
for this right now.

416
00:29:03,959 --> 00:29:06,962
Come on, sugar.
Just give her five minutes.

417
00:29:07,049 --> 00:29:10,270
She was there for me
while you were gone.

418
00:29:13,099 --> 00:29:15,841
Alright, baby.

419
00:29:15,928 --> 00:29:18,844
Baby,
you remember Delia.

420
00:29:18,931 --> 00:29:21,020
Of course.
'Course I do.

421
00:29:21,107 --> 00:29:23,936
Mr. Johnson.
It's such a pleasure.

422
00:29:24,023 --> 00:29:26,939
Mayme tells me that, 
you got a problem

423
00:29:27,026 --> 00:29:28,331
that you wanna
talk to me about?

424
00:29:28,418 --> 00:29:30,290
Yes.

425
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:35,904
My boy Teddy...

426
00:29:35,991 --> 00:29:38,341
he always had
a way with music.

427
00:29:38,428 --> 00:29:41,823
Even when he was little,
any time he played that guitar,

428
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:44,826
everyone would stop whatever
they was doing and listen.

429
00:29:44,913 --> 00:29:46,567
He plays with
Mary Wells.

430
00:29:46,654 --> 00:29:48,569
I know Mary.

431
00:29:51,964 --> 00:29:54,575
Boy must be...
a really good musician

432
00:29:54,662 --> 00:29:57,012
to be playing with Mary.

433
00:29:57,099 --> 00:30:01,974
Yeah, but he got a disease.
An affliction.

434
00:30:02,061 --> 00:30:03,932
Lot of musicians,
they -- they get high.

435
00:30:04,019 --> 00:30:05,978
It's -- It's just
a part of the game.

436
00:30:06,065 --> 00:30:08,241
He don't touch dope.

437
00:30:08,328 --> 00:30:10,286
It's an addiction
to white women.

438
00:30:13,681 --> 00:30:15,291
Sorry.

439
00:30:15,378 --> 00:30:16,902
They demons.

440
00:30:19,992 --> 00:30:22,429
This devil white woman
has taken my son's soul.

441
00:30:22,516 --> 00:30:24,605
You got to help me,
Mr. Johnson.

442
00:31:24,534 --> 00:31:27,668
Your girl can sing,
but she ain't no Celia Cruz.

443
00:31:30,192 --> 00:31:33,369
Manager said Teddy ain't played
the last four nights.

444
00:31:33,456 --> 00:31:35,284
I'll talk with Mary
when she's done.

445
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:40,072
She's better than Celia Cruz.

446
00:32:01,615 --> 00:32:05,053
Bumpy?
Hey.

447
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:08,143
You handsome
geechee motherfucker.

448
00:32:09,188 --> 00:32:12,017
I heard you was out.

449
00:32:12,104 --> 00:32:15,281
How come you ain't
come hear me sing?

450
00:32:15,368 --> 00:32:17,500
I'm here now,
ain't I?

451
00:32:17,587 --> 00:32:19,807
Mary...you got
the voice of an angel,

452
00:32:19,894 --> 00:32:23,158
you know that, right?

453
00:32:23,245 --> 00:32:25,160
You still married?

454
00:32:25,247 --> 00:32:27,771
'Cause if you ain't,

455
00:32:27,858 --> 00:32:29,295
I'd like to have you
for breakfast.

456
00:32:29,382 --> 00:32:30,774
Come on, be a good girl.
Alright?

457
00:32:30,861 --> 00:32:32,298
Okay?

458
00:32:32,385 --> 00:32:34,387
Look, I'm just here
for Teddy Greene,

459
00:32:34,474 --> 00:32:35,459
your guitar player.

460
00:32:35,518 --> 00:32:36,519
You know where he is?

461
00:32:36,606 --> 00:32:38,739
Nope.

462
00:32:38,826 --> 00:32:40,393
Come on.

463
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,438
He in some kind
of trouble?

464
00:32:45,267 --> 00:32:46,965
Guineas looking for him.

465
00:32:47,052 --> 00:32:48,357
Guineas?

466
00:32:48,444 --> 00:32:51,578
Why?

467
00:32:51,665 --> 00:32:55,147
Teddy had a whole key
of that good brown duji.

468
00:32:55,234 --> 00:32:57,192
He uses?

469
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:59,803
Nah, Teddy was peddling.

470
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:02,154
How's a... how's a blues man

471
00:33:02,241 --> 00:33:03,807
get the connections
to get that brown shit?

472
00:33:03,894 --> 00:33:06,332
That brown shit comes --
comes straight off the boat.

473
00:33:06,419 --> 00:33:07,768
I don't know.

474
00:33:07,855 --> 00:33:09,335
You know what?

475
00:33:09,422 --> 00:33:11,467
Teddy's mama,
she's worried sick about him.

476
00:33:14,775 --> 00:33:17,691
Maybe he got it from
that white girl he been seeing.

477
00:33:17,778 --> 00:33:19,693
She's Italian.

478
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:21,042
You know her name?

479
00:33:21,129 --> 00:33:23,044
Nah.
Hey!

480
00:33:23,131 --> 00:33:24,698
Baby.

481
00:33:24,785 --> 00:33:27,092
Teddy's with a guinea girl,
this can go bad.

482
00:33:27,179 --> 00:33:30,486
They will cut off his hands,
and they will cut off his feet.

483
00:33:33,315 --> 00:33:38,233
Please, Bumpy,
don't tell nobody I told you.

484
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:41,062
Go on.

485
00:33:41,149 --> 00:33:43,195
It's Stella Gigante.

486
00:33:43,282 --> 00:33:45,110
What?

487
00:33:45,197 --> 00:33:47,634
Stella Gigante?

488
00:33:47,721 --> 00:33:50,898
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.

489
00:33:50,985 --> 00:33:53,509
Stella's from my first marriage
with Tess.

490
00:33:53,596 --> 00:33:56,034
Always been a handful.

491
00:33:58,558 --> 00:34:03,911
Stella is under the influence
of a Negro.

492
00:34:03,998 --> 00:34:07,610
Like Bathsheba was
seduced by David.

493
00:34:09,525 --> 00:34:14,400
She betrayed her family,
her blood.

494
00:34:14,487 --> 00:34:17,272
Now, under this ni...

495
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:20,493
Sorry, Negro's direction,

496
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:22,669
Stella has stolen
an item from me,

497
00:34:22,756 --> 00:34:26,064
a valuable possession
that I had hidden.

498
00:34:26,151 --> 00:34:30,416
Now I don't know if the two
of them are using the stuff

499
00:34:30,503 --> 00:34:35,160
or if this Negro
just needs the money.

500
00:34:35,247 --> 00:34:37,553
But he has cast
a spell on her.

501
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:40,687
I love you, Teddy.

502
00:34:40,774 --> 00:34:43,864
I love you, Stella.

503
00:34:48,042 --> 00:34:50,088
Now, I have...

504
00:34:50,175 --> 00:34:55,136
I have asked
the Lord our God...

505
00:34:55,223 --> 00:34:58,748
to smite this nigger dead!

506
00:35:05,407 --> 00:35:10,151
And if He can't do it,
I swear to Christ, I will.

507
00:35:22,859 --> 00:35:27,473
It's between you and me only,
strictly off the books.

508
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:31,694
I want
Bumpy Johnson dead.

509
00:35:35,307 --> 00:35:37,787
James Brown just
a bunch of noise to me.

510
00:35:37,874 --> 00:35:39,224
Fool up there gyrating

511
00:35:39,311 --> 00:35:40,486
like he got a cockroach

512
00:35:40,573 --> 00:35:42,140
up his ass.

513
00:35:42,227 --> 00:35:43,315
Can't compare to Lena Horne,
right?

514
00:35:43,402 --> 00:35:45,795
No, sir!
No. No. No.

515
00:35:45,882 --> 00:35:49,016
I got some beeswax
for these Osters of yours,

516
00:35:49,103 --> 00:35:51,149
put a deep shine on 'em.

517
00:35:51,236 --> 00:35:54,021
'Course now the whole world
done changed.

518
00:35:54,108 --> 00:35:56,241
When you was out here,
we didn't have junkies

519
00:35:56,328 --> 00:35:59,244
nodding off
all over the place.

520
00:35:59,331 --> 00:36:00,549
You do what I asked,
Cecil?

521
00:36:00,636 --> 00:36:01,811
Yeah, Bumpy.

522
00:36:01,898 --> 00:36:03,465
So, what you got?

523
00:36:03,552 --> 00:36:06,251
That damn Zambrano cat
you asked about?

524
00:36:06,338 --> 00:36:09,776
Turns out,
he got a taste for dark meat.

525
00:36:09,863 --> 00:36:11,343
Yeah.
That figures.

526
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:14,346
Yeah, a girl on 36th Street
named Flossie,

527
00:36:14,433 --> 00:36:16,957
beautiful chocolate skin,

528
00:36:17,044 --> 00:36:20,830
she skip by his pad,
act like she his maid,

529
00:36:20,917 --> 00:36:24,094
and he get more
than his floors waxed,

530
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:25,835
I'll tell you that.

531
00:36:25,922 --> 00:36:28,229
Flossie?
Yeah, Flossie.

532
00:36:41,808 --> 00:36:43,070
I'm waiting for
Minister Malcolm.

533
00:36:43,157 --> 00:36:44,463
He should be here
any minute.

534
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:47,379
Well, I'm just
warming his chair.

535
00:36:47,466 --> 00:36:48,467
Hello, Cecil.

536
00:36:48,554 --> 00:36:50,860
Hello, Reverend Powell.

537
00:36:50,947 --> 00:36:55,648
It's been a long time,
Johnson.

538
00:36:55,735 --> 00:36:58,259
Welcome back.

539
00:36:58,346 --> 00:37:00,305
I have a --
a political matter

540
00:37:00,392 --> 00:37:02,089
I could use
your assistance with.

541
00:37:02,176 --> 00:37:03,569
I'm a convicted felon,
Congressman.

542
00:37:03,656 --> 00:37:05,875
I ain't got
no vote for you.

543
00:37:05,962 --> 00:37:07,399
Well, I'll keep it
mercifully short.

544
00:37:07,486 --> 00:37:09,923
Those Democrats
at Tammany Hall

545
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:12,273
have rigged things
to keep me off the ballot.

546
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,753
Don't bother asking me

547
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,624
about Frank Costello
or his connections,

548
00:37:15,711 --> 00:37:17,278
'cause I ain't helping you
with shit.

549
00:37:17,365 --> 00:37:19,280
Listen,
you low country

550
00:37:19,367 --> 00:37:22,414
gullah rice picker,
don't pull that shit on me.

551
00:37:22,501 --> 00:37:24,459
Costello can get me
on the ballot.

552
00:37:24,546 --> 00:37:26,722
Listen, you high yella
motherfucker,

553
00:37:26,809 --> 00:37:28,420
just 'cause you come
from Sugar Hill

554
00:37:28,507 --> 00:37:30,291
don't think
you can play me.

555
00:37:30,378 --> 00:37:31,945
When I got sent up,
you said a --

556
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:33,425
a monster got taken
off the street.

557
00:37:33,512 --> 00:37:34,948
You think that
I don't know that?

558
00:37:35,035 --> 00:37:36,341
I think you know
the difference between

559
00:37:36,428 --> 00:37:39,822
public pronouncements
and reality.

560
00:37:39,909 --> 00:37:44,479
I have influence with federal
law enforcement agencies.

561
00:37:44,566 --> 00:37:46,351
Ain't got
no federal beefs.

562
00:37:46,438 --> 00:37:48,962
Yet.

563
00:37:49,049 --> 00:37:50,920
Ready, Reverend Powell?

564
00:37:51,007 --> 00:37:52,661
Next time, Cecil.

565
00:37:52,748 --> 00:37:54,272
Just consider it.

566
00:37:54,359 --> 00:37:55,621
That's all I'm asking.

567
00:38:01,496 --> 00:38:04,325
Brother Malcolm.

568
00:38:04,412 --> 00:38:06,501
Your pretty
slick-suited brothers

569
00:38:06,588 --> 00:38:08,155
have been poaching
from my flock.

570
00:38:08,242 --> 00:38:10,113
Handing out fliers
in front of my church.

571
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,377
Well, you see them
as your flock.

572
00:38:12,464 --> 00:38:14,335
That might just be
the problem.

573
00:38:14,422 --> 00:38:17,382
Well, least they're not
the sheep of Islam

574
00:38:17,469 --> 00:38:20,341
with their woolly suits
and bow ties.

575
00:38:20,428 --> 00:38:24,432
Why don't you let me preach
to your congregation, brother?

576
00:38:24,519 --> 00:38:26,391
See if your white man's
Christianity can

577
00:38:26,478 --> 00:38:28,871
stand up to
the black man's Nation.

578
00:38:30,525 --> 00:38:32,962
When hell
freezes over.

579
00:38:33,049 --> 00:38:34,529
You want my pulpit

580
00:38:34,616 --> 00:38:37,445
because I have 40,000 listeners
on the radio.

581
00:38:40,274 --> 00:38:42,581
I just love seeing
those silver-tongued Negroes

582
00:38:42,668 --> 00:38:44,931
go at it!

583
00:38:45,018 --> 00:38:46,498
I thought you were
helping me shut down

584
00:38:46,585 --> 00:38:48,238
the Randolph Houses,
not trying to leverage

585
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:50,980
a partnership
with these white devils.

586
00:38:51,067 --> 00:38:53,940
- You hustled me. 
- We're both hustlers, Malcolm.

587
00:38:54,027 --> 00:38:55,898
- You just hustle for Islam now, that's all.
- Whoa. Wait.

588
00:38:55,985 --> 00:38:58,118
Wait a minute, brother.
Now, look at you.

589
00:38:58,205 --> 00:39:00,512
Your spit-shined shoes
and Fifth Avenue suit,

590
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:02,165
you're just like
those integrationists

591
00:39:02,252 --> 00:39:03,471
fighting to sit at
the white man's lunch counter,

592
00:39:03,558 --> 00:39:07,519
trying to get
a piece of their pie.

593
00:39:07,606 --> 00:39:10,391
You think
they see you as an equal?

594
00:39:10,478 --> 00:39:12,437
Or you just House Nigga
to the Mob?

595
00:39:12,524 --> 00:39:13,786
Don't make me slap your ass,
Malcolm.

596
00:39:13,873 --> 00:39:15,309
You're overstepping
yourself.

597
00:39:15,396 --> 00:39:16,832
You wanted to be a lawyer
when you were a kid.

598
00:39:16,919 --> 00:39:18,921
Just like me.

599
00:39:19,008 --> 00:39:21,402
We were both told a colored man
could never attain it.

600
00:39:21,489 --> 00:39:22,795
I don't judge you.

601
00:39:22,882 --> 00:39:24,405
You just called me
a House Nigga.

602
00:39:24,492 --> 00:39:27,800
When you cozy up to
these Italians, you are.

603
00:39:27,887 --> 00:39:30,368
Now, you want my respect,

604
00:39:30,455 --> 00:39:33,414
even though I don't
condone your business,

605
00:39:33,501 --> 00:39:36,156
don't integrate.

606
00:39:36,243 --> 00:39:37,810
Separate.

607
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,427
Got some change?

608
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:49,822
A dollar?

609
00:39:49,909 --> 00:39:52,825
Please, need a dollar.

610
00:40:00,615 --> 00:40:03,879
Get yourself
some food.

611
00:40:03,966 --> 00:40:05,490
Get yourself
some <i>food.</i>

612
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:22,594
You gonna eat that
whole thing yourself?

613
00:40:22,681 --> 00:40:24,987
You bet I am.

614
00:40:30,558 --> 00:40:31,951
Daddy's here.

615
00:40:32,038 --> 00:40:33,518
There the two
beautiful ladies are.

616
00:40:34,693 --> 00:40:36,695
Looking beautiful as ever.

617
00:40:42,701 --> 00:40:45,094
You didn't order one for me.

618
00:40:45,181 --> 00:40:46,879
A man ain't seen a split for 11 years

619
00:40:46,966 --> 00:40:48,358
and you ain't got one waiting for him?

620
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:51,797
We ordered you one.

621
00:40:51,884 --> 00:40:54,277
Well, I guess we're just
gonna have to share,

622
00:40:54,364 --> 00:40:58,151
till... till mine comes?

623
00:40:58,238 --> 00:41:02,329
Daddy, you ate the cherry!

624
00:41:02,416 --> 00:41:04,113
Ain't come with no cherry.

625
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,551
'Course it did!

626
00:41:06,638 --> 00:41:09,684
I didn't see no cherry.

627
00:41:09,771 --> 00:41:11,120
Dig in there,

628
00:41:11,207 --> 00:41:13,035
see if it's down
underneath there.

629
00:41:13,122 --> 00:41:14,602
Sometimes they put it
at the bottom.

630
00:41:16,386 --> 00:41:18,301
Daddy, get out
of my sundae.

631
00:41:18,388 --> 00:41:20,086
Who paying for
this sundae?

632
00:41:20,173 --> 00:41:21,043
Mama paying.

633
00:41:22,958 --> 00:41:24,482
Could I have a bite?

634
00:41:26,135 --> 00:41:28,311
This is nice.

635
00:41:37,451 --> 00:41:40,976
I'll be back in a minute.

636
00:41:41,063 --> 00:41:42,325
Don't touch that split.

637
00:42:08,482 --> 00:42:10,571
Baby, come here.
Come here.

638
00:42:14,662 --> 00:42:16,925
Here you go, punk!

639
00:42:17,012 --> 00:42:18,753
You little fuck!

640
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,625
Punk! Come here!

641
00:42:20,712 --> 00:42:22,714
I'm gonna find you, motherfucker!

642
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:30,678
You alright?

643
00:42:30,765 --> 00:42:31,636
You alright?-

644
00:42:31,723 --> 00:42:32,941
Alright.

645
00:42:33,028 --> 00:42:34,769
Come on, baby.

646
00:42:34,856 --> 00:42:36,118
Come on, sit here.

647
00:42:44,736 --> 00:42:47,608
It's not mine.
I found it outside.

648
00:42:52,134 --> 00:42:55,398
Hey.

649
00:42:56,486 --> 00:42:59,141
Well, what happened?

650
00:42:59,228 --> 00:43:01,361
We both missed.

651
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:07,628
Yeah, it didn't take long.

652
00:43:07,715 --> 00:43:10,065
We caught him up
on Washington Heights.

653
00:43:10,152 --> 00:43:14,374
When you said that motherfuckin' <i>
con culo</i>was black as coal,

654
00:43:14,461 --> 00:43:17,246
I knew right away
it was El Mugre.

655
00:43:17,333 --> 00:43:18,683
That motherfucker did hits

656
00:43:18,770 --> 00:43:21,686
for the Genovese family
in Havana

657
00:43:21,773 --> 00:43:24,384
before Castro came in
and spoiled the party.

658
00:43:24,471 --> 00:43:26,647
Now he work
for them up here.

659
00:43:26,734 --> 00:43:28,214
Guapo...

660
00:43:28,301 --> 00:43:31,696
find out who paid him to make
a move on Bumpy.

661
00:44:31,538 --> 00:44:33,888
Time to call Buster?

662
00:44:33,975 --> 00:44:35,760
Yeah.

663
00:44:35,847 --> 00:44:37,587
Call Buster.

664
00:45:00,915 --> 00:45:03,483
He's all yours.

665
00:45:21,066 --> 00:45:22,937
It was Zambrano!

666
00:45:23,024 --> 00:45:25,592
Zambrano paid me!

667
00:45:25,679 --> 00:45:28,377
Zambrano. Chin's guy.

668
00:45:28,464 --> 00:45:31,816
Thought it would take longer than that.

669
00:45:31,903 --> 00:45:36,734
Don't ever underestimate
Big Dick Buster.

670
00:45:36,821 --> 00:45:38,648
Hey, let's go tell Bumpy.

671
00:45:46,831 --> 00:45:50,095
You like what you see?

672
00:45:52,924 --> 00:45:54,882
Up for some fun, baby?

673
00:45:54,969 --> 00:45:57,537
Get your ass outta here!

674
00:46:03,238 --> 00:46:04,457
Go on, now!

675
00:46:09,505 --> 00:46:12,944
What we gon' do, Bump?

676
00:46:13,031 --> 00:46:15,642
Get loud and boisterous.

677
00:46:44,932 --> 00:46:47,717
When I was doing my detox
in solitary at Charleston,

678
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:49,415
they called me "Satan."

679
00:46:49,502 --> 00:46:51,939
I was so full of hate.

680
00:46:52,026 --> 00:46:53,506
I need to talk to you
about something.

681
00:46:53,593 --> 00:46:56,814
I've done enough talking,
brother.

682
00:46:56,901 --> 00:46:59,077
I decided to
follow your advice

683
00:46:59,164 --> 00:47:01,253
and separate from the guineas
once and for all.

684
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:05,431
Can't give you any specifics,
but I need your help.

685
00:47:05,518 --> 00:47:07,868
Looking for a couple of kids
that went on the run from Chin,

686
00:47:07,955 --> 00:47:09,435
and I could use
the Fruit of Islam

687
00:47:09,522 --> 00:47:12,873
to help me find them.

688
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:14,962
You have the audacity

689
00:47:15,049 --> 00:47:18,879
to ask me to use
the Nation again?

690
00:47:18,966 --> 00:47:23,057
I remember
one night back in '47.

691
00:47:23,144 --> 00:47:25,233
You brought a carload
of white boys up here

692
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:28,933
for some reefer
and a little bit of pussy.

693
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:32,937
And them Blood Alley Boys
wanted to kill you.

694
00:47:33,024 --> 00:47:35,940
But I calmed
their asses down.

695
00:47:36,027 --> 00:47:37,942
And I told you that night
that if you stay in Harlem,

696
00:47:38,029 --> 00:47:40,422
you're gonna end up dead.

697
00:47:40,509 --> 00:47:42,685
Now, isn't that the night
that you're referring to

698
00:47:42,772 --> 00:47:46,994
when you said that
I set you on the path to Islam?

699
00:47:47,081 --> 00:47:48,996
Alright.

700
00:47:51,781 --> 00:47:54,654
But there's something
you'll need to do for me.

701
00:48:00,965 --> 00:48:02,575
- Hey.
- Adam, there's someone here to see you.

702
00:48:02,662 --> 00:48:04,272
I told him you weren't
receiving any visitors.

703
00:48:04,359 --> 00:48:06,927
At last, Moses comes
to the mountain.

704
00:48:07,014 --> 00:48:08,537
It's alright, Patricia.

705
00:48:08,624 --> 00:48:10,975
Mr. Johnson is one
of our prized constituents.

706
00:48:11,062 --> 00:48:13,716
To what do I owe this honor,
Mr. Johnson?

707
00:48:13,803 --> 00:48:15,240
I'll speak to Costello

708
00:48:15,327 --> 00:48:18,939
about getting you
on the ballot.

709
00:48:19,026 --> 00:48:23,465
And what do you want
in return?

710
00:48:23,552 --> 00:48:25,685
Your pulpit.

711
00:48:34,215 --> 00:48:36,261
They call it a "phone tree."

712
00:48:36,348 --> 00:48:39,917
Each Nation of Islam soldier
calls 50 other soldiers.

713
00:48:40,004 --> 00:48:41,483
They searched
every no-tell motel

714
00:48:41,570 --> 00:48:43,703
in the five boroughs
looking for them kids.

715
00:48:43,790 --> 00:48:47,011
Turns out, they was right here
in Hamilton Heights.

716
00:48:47,098 --> 00:48:52,016
So, they're in here.
One of Malcolm's men found 'em.

717
00:49:03,114 --> 00:49:04,376
What you go
and do that for?

718
00:49:04,463 --> 00:49:05,986
She bit me.

719
00:49:10,251 --> 00:49:12,210
Alright, hey?

720
00:49:12,297 --> 00:49:14,386
I ain't gonna hurt you,
alright?

721
00:49:14,473 --> 00:49:16,083
I'm-a take this
outta your mouth.

722
00:49:16,170 --> 00:49:17,998
Don't bite me.

723
00:49:18,085 --> 00:49:19,826
You stay the fuck
away from me!

724
00:49:19,913 --> 00:49:23,047
What are you doing?

725
00:49:23,134 --> 00:49:24,962
Who are you?

726
00:49:25,049 --> 00:49:26,964
Bumpy Johnson.
I'm a friend of your mama's.

727
00:49:27,051 --> 00:49:28,530
You know
who my father is?

728
00:49:28,617 --> 00:49:31,577
He's gonna kill you
for this shit, I promise.

729
00:49:31,664 --> 00:49:34,145
Of that...
I have no doubt.

730
00:49:34,232 --> 00:49:36,756
And...
what do you think

731
00:49:36,843 --> 00:49:40,064
that he's gonna do
to your boyfriend?

732
00:49:41,108 --> 00:49:42,675
Right.

733
00:49:42,762 --> 00:49:44,982
So...

734
00:49:45,069 --> 00:49:46,984
I'm gonna send him
down South for awhile

735
00:49:47,071 --> 00:49:48,594
till things cool off.

736
00:49:48,681 --> 00:49:51,075
It's the least I could do
for your mama.

737
00:49:51,162 --> 00:49:52,076
I ain't going
nowhere --

738
00:49:52,163 --> 00:49:53,903
Hey!

739
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:56,036
You think her father
won't kill her

740
00:49:56,123 --> 00:49:57,603
for fucking a Negro

741
00:49:57,690 --> 00:50:00,823
and stealing a key
of his duji?

742
00:50:00,910 --> 00:50:04,262
Romeo and Juliet
isn't a romance.

743
00:50:04,349 --> 00:50:08,353
It's just two dumb kids
who end up dead.

744
00:50:17,275 --> 00:50:20,104
What is this?
Your ticket to freedom?

745
00:50:20,191 --> 00:50:22,932
What you gonna
do with that?

746
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:27,111
I'm saving your ass.

747
00:50:27,198 --> 00:50:28,590
Now, give me that cross.

748
00:50:46,695 --> 00:50:48,436
I'll see you two later.

749
00:50:48,523 --> 00:50:50,699
What about Malcolm?
Don't you wanna hear him speak?

750
00:50:50,786 --> 00:50:52,701
I already got the message.

751
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:03,277
We can, 
thank Bumpy Johnson for this.

752
00:51:03,364 --> 00:51:06,150
Yeah, well, I'm sure there's
a quid pro quo, brother.

753
00:51:06,237 --> 00:51:08,935
I trust you will stay
within the bounds of propriety.

754
00:51:09,022 --> 00:51:11,155
Well, there's
nothing I'm going to say

755
00:51:11,242 --> 00:51:12,982
your parishioners
can't handle.

756
00:51:14,941 --> 00:51:16,116
Hello, sister.

757
00:51:20,251 --> 00:51:25,691
Our congregation must open 
its hearts and minds...

758
00:51:25,778 --> 00:51:28,781
to people of all faiths,

759
00:51:28,868 --> 00:51:34,091
knowing that we are
all one people of one God.

760
00:51:34,178 --> 00:51:36,963
Today, I present

761
00:51:37,050 --> 00:51:41,185
Minister Malcolm X.

762
00:51:44,405 --> 00:51:47,191
A friend of mine recently reminded me

763
00:51:47,278 --> 00:51:50,237
of the importance
of coming together as a people

764
00:51:50,324 --> 00:51:52,021
to face a common enemy.

765
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:53,762
Come on.
Back of the bus.

766
00:51:53,849 --> 00:51:56,330
We must forget our differences

767
00:51:56,417 --> 00:51:59,159
to fight a system of oppression.

768
00:51:59,246 --> 00:52:02,206
Tactics based on morality
can only succeed

769
00:52:02,293 --> 00:52:05,252
when you are dealing with
a system that is moral.

770
00:52:05,339 --> 00:52:08,516
If a dog is biting a black man,
whether a police dog,

771
00:52:08,603 --> 00:52:11,302
a hound dog,
or any other type of dog,

772
00:52:11,389 --> 00:52:14,261
that black man
should kill that dog.

773
00:52:14,348 --> 00:52:17,308
Or any two-legged dog
that sics the dog on him.

774
00:52:17,395 --> 00:52:19,353
If the government is unwilling

775
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:21,964
to protect the lives
of our people,

776
00:52:22,051 --> 00:52:24,271
our people are
within their rights

777
00:52:24,358 --> 00:52:28,493
to protect themselves
by whatever means necessary.

778
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:30,190
And I repeat,

779
00:52:30,277 --> 00:52:32,366
because to me, this is
the most important thing,

780
00:52:32,453 --> 00:52:34,934
our people are
within their rights

781
00:52:35,021 --> 00:52:37,371
to protect themselves...Keep going.

782
00:52:37,458 --> 00:52:39,373
...by whatever... don't stop.

783
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:41,070
Keep going....means...

784
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:42,333
Keep going.

785
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:44,073
- ...necessary.
- Keep going.

786
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:47,251
Get up.

787
00:52:47,338 --> 00:52:49,340
Fuck!

788
00:52:50,732 --> 00:52:53,082
Fuck! Fuck you!

789
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:54,954
Fuck, motherfucker!

790
00:52:55,041 --> 00:52:56,869
You nigga, fuck you!

791
00:52:56,956 --> 00:52:58,610
Fuck you!
Fuck you!

792
00:52:58,697 --> 00:53:00,351
Carve that
motherfucker up!

793
00:53:02,309 --> 00:53:04,398
You can't do this,
you dumb fucker!

794
00:53:04,485 --> 00:53:05,356
I'm made!

795
00:53:05,443 --> 00:53:07,271
This is for Dexter.

796
00:53:07,358 --> 00:53:08,359
No, no, no, no...

797
00:53:08,446 --> 00:53:10,230
Fucker!

798
00:53:10,317 --> 00:53:12,798
Flossie, you gotta go.
I need you to get out of town.

799
00:53:12,885 --> 00:53:15,017
You hear me?

800
00:53:46,310 --> 00:53:48,355
Look...

801
00:53:48,442 --> 00:53:52,272
I'm gonna give Johnson
110th to 160th Street.

802
00:53:52,359 --> 00:53:55,232
I'm gonna try and work with him.

803
00:53:55,319 --> 00:53:59,061
Why the change of heart?

804
00:53:59,148 --> 00:54:01,281
Zambrano, he stole
a key of H from me,

805
00:54:01,368 --> 00:54:04,893
and I had to take him out.

806
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:06,895
Somebody's gotta keep
those niggers in line,

807
00:54:06,982 --> 00:54:09,376
so might as well
be Johnson.

808
00:54:12,336 --> 00:54:13,380
Okay.

809
00:54:13,467 --> 00:54:15,687
Good for everybody.

810
00:54:59,426 --> 00:55:03,387
I told Costello that you can do
your business in Harlem.

811
00:55:06,651 --> 00:55:08,305
Now, give me
my fucking daughter.

812
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:11,395
You didn't touch her,
did ya?

813
00:55:13,832 --> 00:55:16,008
I'm not an animal.

814
00:55:26,888 --> 00:55:30,544
This whole thing you did here,
it's a nice move.

815
00:55:30,631 --> 00:55:34,679
But I liked it better when
you people knew your place.

816
00:55:34,766 --> 00:55:38,422
You know what they say.
Times are changing.

817
00:55:38,509 --> 00:55:39,988
Yeah.

818
00:55:44,689 --> 00:55:46,908
They didn't touch you,
did they?

819
00:55:46,995 --> 00:55:49,520
No, Daddy.
You sure?

820
00:55:49,607 --> 00:55:52,174
<i>Mia cara passerotta.</i>

821
00:55:52,261 --> 00:55:55,569
Well, let's go.

822
00:55:55,656 --> 00:55:57,179
Let's go, come on.

823
00:56:31,518 --> 00:56:33,781
Hey, there, little one.

824
00:56:43,095 --> 00:56:47,621
Why are you here?
Margaret okay?

825
00:56:49,493 --> 00:56:52,452
Your daughter's fine, Elise.
She's fine.

826
00:56:56,195 --> 00:56:59,807
I came here 'cause...

827
00:56:59,894 --> 00:57:01,896
I wanna help <i>you.</i>

828
00:57:05,378 --> 00:57:08,512
I'm high, Daddy.

829
00:57:08,599 --> 00:57:10,688
Leave me alone.

830
00:57:19,218 --> 00:57:20,698
I can't.

831
00:57:24,702 --> 00:57:26,617
I'm your father.

831
00:57:27,305 --> 00:58:27,349
