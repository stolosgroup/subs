1
00:00:04,308 --> 00:00:06,049
So, I want you to talk to me...

2
00:00:06,136 --> 00:00:08,138
about how they locked you
in a cage like an animal.

3
00:00:08,225 --> 00:00:11,185
Baby, nobody does that time
and comes out fine.

4
00:00:11,272 --> 00:00:12,577
I was scared.

5
00:00:12,664 --> 00:00:14,231
Baby, we have got
a lot to lose.

6
00:00:14,318 --> 00:00:16,842
And I need you to control
your temper.

7
00:00:16,929 --> 00:00:18,322
The Italians.

8
00:00:18,409 --> 00:00:19,929
They're creating a problem
for us, Bumpy.

9
00:00:19,976 --> 00:00:21,341
That's Chin Gigante's crew.

10
00:00:21,369 --> 00:00:22,848
Harlem's mine.

11
00:00:22,935 --> 00:00:24,850
Times have changed.

12
00:00:24,937 --> 00:00:28,289
I haven't.

13
00:00:28,376 --> 00:00:30,421
He went away
on a narcotics rap.

14
00:00:30,508 --> 00:00:32,858
He never snitched.
Bumpy is protected.

15
00:00:32,945 --> 00:00:34,643
I knew that cat before he changed his name,

16
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:36,210
before he got that "X."

17
00:00:36,297 --> 00:00:38,081
Shutting down drug corners
where children grow up

18
00:00:38,168 --> 00:00:39,604
is the Nation's cause.

19
00:00:39,691 --> 00:00:41,084
Think if it was yours.

20
00:00:41,171 --> 00:00:42,477
I'll speak to Costello

21
00:00:42,564 --> 00:00:43,826
about getting you
on the ballot.

22
00:00:43,913 --> 00:00:46,263
And what do you want
in return?

23
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:48,700
We can...
thank Bumpy Johnson for this.

24
00:00:48,787 --> 00:00:50,224
I'm saving your ass.

25
00:00:50,311 --> 00:00:51,877
I'm gonna send him
down South for awhile,

26
00:00:51,964 --> 00:00:53,314
till things cool off.

27
00:00:53,401 --> 00:00:54,706
Now, this is Richie Zambrano.

28
00:00:54,793 --> 00:00:55,925
He's my capo.
He come down from Detroit.

29
00:00:56,012 --> 00:00:56,969
He's my cousin.

30
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,275
I'm gonna give Johnson 110th

31
00:00:58,362 --> 00:01:00,103
to 160th Street.

32
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:02,236
Your daughter's fine.

33
00:01:02,323 --> 00:01:03,846
I want to help you.

34
00:01:03,933 --> 00:01:07,110
I'm high, Daddy.

35
00:01:07,197 --> 00:01:08,894
Leave me alone.

36
00:01:11,593 --> 00:01:13,290
I can't.

37
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,074

38
00:02:08,867 --> 00:02:10,913
Del Chance.

39
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,263
What? You come here
to wish me happy birthday?

40
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:15,178
Happy birthday,
Big Earl.

41
00:02:15,265 --> 00:02:17,224
Chance here about
the hardest motherfucker

42
00:02:17,311 --> 00:02:19,617
who ever walked
the streets of Harlem.

43
00:02:19,704 --> 00:02:21,184
I want you
to meet somebody.

44
00:02:21,271 --> 00:02:24,579
Big Earl Ison,
this is Bumpy Johnson.

45
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:26,755
Bumpy Johnson.

46
00:02:26,842 --> 00:02:28,235
Shit, I've been hearing
stories about you

47
00:02:28,322 --> 00:02:30,062
since I was in britches.

48
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,195
Chance told me about how
you took the Parkside Houses.

49
00:02:32,282 --> 00:02:34,241
It's impressive.

50
00:02:34,328 --> 00:02:35,938
You mind if I bend your ear
for a minute?

51
00:02:37,592 --> 00:02:39,942
Earl...
you know the one thing

52
00:02:40,029 --> 00:02:41,944
that the guineas have
always had over us?

53
00:02:42,031 --> 00:02:44,076
They were organized.

54
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:47,863
Capos, consiglieres,
soldiers --

55
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:50,387
it's a hierarchy.

56
00:02:50,474 --> 00:02:52,259
It's that organization --

57
00:02:52,346 --> 00:02:55,392
that organization that got them
where they are today.

58
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:59,266
But we -- we've always
been disorganized.

59
00:02:59,353 --> 00:03:01,355
I mean, how else
could the white man

60
00:03:01,442 --> 00:03:04,358
snatch millions of Negroes
out of Africa?

61
00:03:04,445 --> 00:03:08,231
Instead of coming together
and crushing them,

62
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:11,756
we're so busy warring
amongst ourselves.

63
00:03:11,843 --> 00:03:15,020
I mean, we rely
on the Italians

64
00:03:15,107 --> 00:03:17,545
for our numbers banks,
for the dope.

65
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,895
We pay a tax for all the women
that we put out on the street,

66
00:03:19,982 --> 00:03:21,375
for the dice games
in the alley.

67
00:03:21,462 --> 00:03:22,680
I mean, this shit --
This shit -- Come on!

68
00:03:22,767 --> 00:03:24,247
This shit gotta stop,
right?

69
00:03:24,334 --> 00:03:26,293
And you're gonna be
the boss man?

70
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:29,296
I've been on this street
for 30 years,

71
00:03:29,383 --> 00:03:32,647
and what we need
is organization.

72
00:03:34,301 --> 00:03:38,000
You and me...

73
00:03:38,087 --> 00:03:40,045
You'd make more money,

74
00:03:40,132 --> 00:03:42,352
and you'd have protection --

75
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:46,661
the kind of protection you get
when we got each other's backs.

76
00:03:46,748 --> 00:03:51,666
This is what
I want to accomplish.

77
00:03:51,753 --> 00:03:54,408
What about the duji?

78
00:03:54,495 --> 00:03:56,888
Can't control Harlem unless
you got a steady source of duji.

79
00:03:56,975 --> 00:03:58,412
The guineas, they --

80
00:03:58,499 --> 00:04:02,416
they'll sell you a key
for $27,000...

81
00:04:02,503 --> 00:04:04,635
but I can get it
from the spics

82
00:04:04,722 --> 00:04:06,724
for $21,000.

83
00:04:06,811 --> 00:04:10,293
Come on!
That second-class shit?

84
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:12,861
I get that
grease ball dynamite.

85
00:04:12,948 --> 00:04:15,646
How you think
I took over Parkside?

86
00:04:15,733 --> 00:04:18,475
You cut that shit
80%, ooh.

87
00:04:18,562 --> 00:04:22,610
Still knock a motherfucker
on his ass.

88
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:27,658
It's your choice, Earl.

89
00:04:27,745 --> 00:04:31,880
You the legend, Bumpy.

90
00:04:31,967 --> 00:04:35,100
Just a little
outta step.

91
00:04:35,187 --> 00:04:39,540
Besides, the guineas do
just right by me.

92
00:04:39,627 --> 00:04:43,283
So, if you will excuse me,
I need to...

93
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:47,199
get back to my ladies.

94
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:50,551
Alright.

95
00:04:50,638 --> 00:04:54,468
Happy birthday.

96
00:05:05,566 --> 00:05:09,047
Take that nigger out back.

97
00:05:21,016 --> 00:05:22,713
One thing Earl was right about...

98
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,150
we need that duji.

99
00:07:28,099 --> 00:07:30,058
Aw, fuck!

100
00:07:30,145 --> 00:07:33,496
Fuck.

101
00:07:43,201 --> 00:07:45,247
Officers...
I can explain.

102
00:07:45,334 --> 00:07:48,032
Quite honestly, I work
with juvies in my spare time.

103
00:07:48,119 --> 00:07:49,904
I gave this kid
a ride to the airport

104
00:07:49,991 --> 00:07:52,341
to visit his grandmother
in Syracuse.

105
00:07:52,428 --> 00:07:54,561
I had no idea
he left that in there.

106
00:07:54,648 --> 00:07:56,171
Tell it to your attorney.

107
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,826
Fellas, come on.

108
00:07:58,913 --> 00:08:01,568
We gotta be able
to work this out.

109
00:08:01,655 --> 00:08:03,352
You O'Halloran's brother?

110
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:05,310
Chuck O'Halloran
from the 27th?

111
00:08:05,397 --> 00:08:07,399
That's my man.
We got to the Copa together.

112
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,663
We chase the ladies.
He'll vouch for me.

113
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,882
Shut the fuck up.

114
00:08:16,191 --> 00:08:18,498
Hey, boyos!
It's Detective Ryan Clark.

115
00:08:18,585 --> 00:08:20,369
Special Investigative Unit.

116
00:08:20,456 --> 00:08:22,589
We heard your call
to dispatch.

117
00:08:26,767 --> 00:08:28,725
Congratulations.

118
00:08:28,812 --> 00:08:31,423
You just helped to close
a three-months investigation.

119
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,600
We'll take it from here,
fellas.

120
00:08:33,687 --> 00:08:36,385
Come on, Schoolboy.
Let's go.

121
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:45,525
Get that white boy?

122
00:08:45,612 --> 00:08:47,614
Chin: You want to
sell me back my dope?

123
00:08:47,701 --> 00:08:49,616
How much?

124
00:08:49,703 --> 00:08:53,968
We seized three keys.
The buyback's $20,000 a key.

125
00:08:54,055 --> 00:08:55,143
That's 60K.

126
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:57,449
No, 30.
10 a key.

127
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:00,714
Your guy only got arrested
by beat cops, not us.

128
00:09:00,801 --> 00:09:03,151
We gotta make that
go away, too.

129
00:09:03,238 --> 00:09:04,805
45.

130
00:09:04,892 --> 00:09:06,371
We don't negotiate.

131
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:08,417
The fuck? If one of yours gets pinched,

132
00:09:08,504 --> 00:09:09,897
you buy back your dope.

133
00:09:09,984 --> 00:09:12,421
That's the rule.

134
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:23,824
Yeah.

135
00:09:23,911 --> 00:09:25,477
It's a deal.

136
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,610
Get the money.

137
00:09:30,744 --> 00:09:32,484
In the old days,
your delivery guy

138
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:36,706
would've been
in a '52 Chevy.

139
00:09:36,793 --> 00:09:41,232
In that Karmann Ghia blastin'
that nigger music...

140
00:09:41,319 --> 00:09:44,018
his license plate might as well
have said "Pusher."

141
00:09:44,105 --> 00:09:45,628
Yeah, so what?

142
00:09:45,715 --> 00:09:46,716
What, you never had fun
when you were a kid?

143
00:09:46,803 --> 00:09:48,239
Come on.

144
00:09:48,326 --> 00:09:50,677
I forgot.
You're -- You're a cop.

145
00:09:50,764 --> 00:09:53,418
No fun for cops.

146
00:09:53,505 --> 00:09:54,724
Hang on a second.

147
00:09:54,811 --> 00:09:59,424
There's a guy in Harlem,

148
00:09:59,511 --> 00:10:00,861
and I can't touch him

149
00:10:00,948 --> 00:10:02,689
'cause he's protected
by the families.

150
00:10:02,776 --> 00:10:06,693
We're not button men.

151
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:10,653
50 grand.

152
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:14,614
50 grand to send that nigger
back to Alcatraz.

153
00:10:17,878 --> 00:10:20,445
I only ever buy my coke
from the Colombianos,

154
00:10:20,532 --> 00:10:22,186
but they're telling me
their heroin --

155
00:10:22,273 --> 00:10:23,666
pretty good.

156
00:10:23,753 --> 00:10:26,538
I need some good duji, Guapo.Trust me.

157
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:30,412
My Colombiano friend says
his shit is good.

158
00:10:30,499 --> 00:10:33,023
Alright, let's see what
The Vein gotta say.

159
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:34,851
Go ahead, man.

160
00:10:34,938 --> 00:10:37,767
I don't mind if I do.

161
00:11:07,405 --> 00:11:10,452
This ain't it.

162
00:11:10,539 --> 00:11:13,107
What the fuck is this?

163
00:11:13,194 --> 00:11:16,545
This wrong.
It's bad.

164
00:11:16,632 --> 00:11:18,068
Give him a shot
of that good shit.Fuckin' bullshit!

165
00:11:18,155 --> 00:11:19,461
Hurry it up.

166
00:11:19,548 --> 00:11:21,289
Come on, man.What is this, man?

167
00:11:21,376 --> 00:11:23,378
Calm down.
My man, calm down.

168
00:11:23,465 --> 00:11:25,597
- Give me some real shit.
- Hey, come on, man.

169
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:26,860
You're supposed to be
helping me out here.

170
00:11:26,947 --> 00:11:29,123
I need that good duji,
Guapo.

171
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:30,690
The good shit!

172
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,788
She really loves me.

173
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:43,485
Can you focus, Guapo?

174
00:11:43,572 --> 00:11:46,923
I heard about this Cuban pusher
up off 58th and Lenox.

175
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:49,099
Bump, you ain't moving
no serious weight

176
00:11:49,186 --> 00:11:50,710
without the guineas.

177
00:11:50,797 --> 00:11:53,060
I'm through with
the guineas, man.

178
00:11:53,147 --> 00:11:56,890
What about this...
Cuban pusher?

179
00:11:56,977 --> 00:11:58,892
Feo Gomez?
Yeah.

180
00:11:58,979 --> 00:12:02,373
That's one strange
motherfucker.

181
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,984
He hates cold-callers.

182
00:12:04,071 --> 00:12:05,942
Who don't?

183
00:12:07,901 --> 00:12:10,164
I'll give Feo a call.

184
00:12:11,905 --> 00:12:14,211
Please, I need it.

185
00:12:14,298 --> 00:12:15,778
One more shot.

186
00:12:15,865 --> 00:12:17,780
Baby, knock that monkey
off your back.

187
00:12:17,867 --> 00:12:19,651
Come on.
Kick the habit.

188
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,305
Kick whitey
off your back.

189
00:12:21,392 --> 00:12:23,960
Please, one more shot.
One more shot.

190
00:12:24,047 --> 00:12:25,745
Please!

191
00:12:25,832 --> 00:12:26,876
How long
will she be here?

192
00:12:28,486 --> 00:12:30,837
I can't give you
an exact date or time.

193
00:12:30,924 --> 00:12:32,099
And how come?

194
00:12:32,186 --> 00:12:33,970
Because it depends.

195
00:12:34,057 --> 00:12:35,002
On what?

196
00:12:35,058 --> 00:12:36,625
On how long it takes her

197
00:12:36,712 --> 00:12:38,409
to admit to herself
she's an addict.

198
00:12:38,496 --> 00:12:41,804
She don't gotta admit nothing.
Elise is dope fiend.

199
00:12:41,891 --> 00:12:45,242
You ever wonder why there are
more addicts in Harlem

200
00:12:45,329 --> 00:12:48,855
than anywhere in
the Western world?

201
00:12:48,942 --> 00:12:52,162
We narcotize ourselves against
being black in America.

202
00:12:54,556 --> 00:12:56,427
Alright, alright.

203
00:12:56,514 --> 00:12:58,821
The white man uses narcotics
to subjugate us

204
00:12:58,908 --> 00:13:01,476
just as firmly
as a master's whip and chain.

205
00:13:01,563 --> 00:13:06,263
Minister, I appreciate you
taking the time.

206
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:09,397
Ellsworth has always
spoken highly of you.

207
00:13:09,484 --> 00:13:11,703
But I believe
that Jesus Christ

208
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,618
is our Lord and Savior.

209
00:13:13,705 --> 00:13:17,013
Ellsworth has tried to help
that girl six ways to Sunday

210
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,623
and white man
or no white man,

211
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:21,017
she ain't never getting
that monkey off her back.

212
00:13:21,104 --> 00:13:23,846
Well, she is not
lost to Allah.

213
00:13:23,933 --> 00:13:27,067
She is his child
just as much as she is yours.

214
00:13:27,154 --> 00:13:28,895
My child?

215
00:13:28,982 --> 00:13:31,898
Do I look old enough
to be her mother?

216
00:13:31,985 --> 00:13:33,943
Forgive me.

217
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:36,685
Ellsworth had Elise
long before we met.

218
00:13:36,772 --> 00:13:38,905
We adopted Margaret
because Elise wasn't in no shape

219
00:13:38,992 --> 00:13:40,297
to be a proper mother.

220
00:13:45,737 --> 00:13:49,263
She is the one who needs forgiven.

221
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:52,614
Pettigrew: Come on, Chance.
You need to get with the times.

222
00:13:52,701 --> 00:13:55,312
Nigga, I don't eat no forbidden fruit.

223
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:59,621
Get with it, man.
You need to eat the pussy.

224
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:00,883
Raw meat?

225
00:14:02,493 --> 00:14:05,757
I ain't no Jap stuck on Okinawa,
motherfucker.

226
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:08,021
Women want more
these days, Chance.

227
00:14:08,108 --> 00:14:10,197
Unless you can put it
in a frying pan

228
00:14:10,284 --> 00:14:12,982
with some onions
and some gravy...

229
00:14:13,069 --> 00:14:15,028
I ain't eating that shit.

230
00:14:15,115 --> 00:14:16,420
Money's in the trunk.

231
00:14:16,507 --> 00:14:18,901
I'm gonna talk to this Feo Gomez.

232
00:14:18,988 --> 00:14:23,645
If I ain't out in 10,
then something's wrong.

233
00:14:45,319 --> 00:14:46,842
Bumpy Johnson.

234
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:00,334
They call me Feo.

235
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,472
You got the money?

236
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:11,780
It's nearby.

237
00:15:11,867 --> 00:15:14,000
Guapo said
you're alright.

238
00:15:14,087 --> 00:15:15,088
Yeah, yeah.

239
00:15:15,175 --> 00:15:17,786
I'm alright.

240
00:15:17,873 --> 00:15:19,396
You're supposed
to bring the money.

241
00:15:19,483 --> 00:15:23,313
After I see the duji.

242
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,490
Guapo said
you did Alcatraz.

243
00:15:26,577 --> 00:15:28,014
What we talkin' about?

244
00:15:28,101 --> 00:15:29,319
What does that have to do
with anything?

245
00:15:29,406 --> 00:15:31,974
Just being friendly.

246
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:54,736
Sample right there.

247
00:16:02,526 --> 00:16:05,181
So-so, man.

248
00:16:05,268 --> 00:16:09,011
Get the money.

249
00:16:09,098 --> 00:16:11,057
Why you sweatin'?

250
00:16:11,144 --> 00:16:12,536
It's cold as witch's tit
in here.

251
00:16:12,623 --> 00:16:14,321
Why are you sweatin'?High blood pressure.

252
00:16:14,408 --> 00:16:16,149
I got a heart condition.

253
00:16:16,236 --> 00:16:18,064
What's down there?

254
00:16:18,151 --> 00:16:19,500
Bedroom.

255
00:16:19,587 --> 00:16:21,110
Mind if I go check it out? <i>Hermano!</i>

256
00:16:21,197 --> 00:16:24,157
I got a three-month-old baby
in there.

257
00:16:24,244 --> 00:16:27,203
My wife will kill my ass
if I wake that kid up.

258
00:16:34,167 --> 00:16:36,996
Now go get the money, <i>
pendejo.</i>

259
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:38,998
If you want the junk!

260
00:16:39,085 --> 00:16:41,000
Gotta make sure, man...

261
00:16:41,087 --> 00:16:43,219
Hands up, nigger.
Don't fucking move.

262
00:16:43,306 --> 00:16:44,731
He said he would kill
my wife and baby

263
00:16:44,786 --> 00:16:46,005
if I didn't set you up.

264
00:16:46,092 --> 00:16:46,917
<i>Lo siento.</i>

265
00:16:46,962 --> 00:16:48,572
He's sorry.

266
00:16:50,226 --> 00:16:52,098
You're under arrest
for drug possession

267
00:16:52,185 --> 00:16:53,142
and murder.

268
00:17:09,115 --> 00:17:11,073
- Are you Bobby Robinson?
- Who's asking?

269
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:14,903
Stella Gigante.

270
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:16,687
Vincent Gigante's daughter.

271
00:17:20,343 --> 00:17:23,085
So, what can I do for you, Miss Stella?

272
00:17:23,172 --> 00:17:24,826
In my opinion,
you're the best judge of talent

273
00:17:24,913 --> 00:17:26,915
in the music business.

274
00:17:27,002 --> 00:17:29,222
Teddy Greene is special.

275
00:17:29,309 --> 00:17:30,701
The minute you listen,

276
00:17:30,788 --> 00:17:32,529
you're gonna want
to sign him, too.

277
00:17:32,616 --> 00:17:34,227
Just take a listen.

278
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,068
<i>Hello? Teddy?</i>

279
00:17:49,155 --> 00:17:50,373
Baby?

280
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:51,853
I see why my mama
left here.

281
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,376
If I was with you,

282
00:17:53,463 --> 00:17:55,639
I'd be hanging from
a tree right now.

283
00:17:55,726 --> 00:17:57,293
<i>Teddy, baby, listen to me.</i>

284
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:00,992
Bobby Robinson's gonna
listen to the demo.

285
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,516
<i>Are you serious?</i>

286
00:18:02,603 --> 00:18:04,170
I'm telling you... he's gonna listen to it,

287
00:18:04,257 --> 00:18:06,868
he's gonna love it,
and it's all gonna happen.

288
00:18:09,175 --> 00:18:11,351
I'll be in Harlem
on the next bus back.

289
00:18:11,438 --> 00:18:13,657
Baby, you can't do that.

290
00:18:13,744 --> 00:18:16,312
Not until all this stuff
with my dad is settled.

291
00:18:16,399 --> 00:18:17,879
Even now, he's got
one of his soldiers

292
00:18:17,966 --> 00:18:19,185
following me around.

293
00:18:19,272 --> 00:18:21,665
But don't worry.
I have a plan.

294
00:18:21,752 --> 00:18:23,276
<i>I'm gonna convince him
we broke up.</i>

295
00:18:23,363 --> 00:18:25,104
What?

296
00:18:25,191 --> 00:18:29,195
<i>It'll get him
off our back.</i>

297
00:18:29,282 --> 00:18:31,197
I couldn't sleep
last night.

298
00:18:31,284 --> 00:18:34,374
I miss you bad, Stell.

299
00:18:34,461 --> 00:18:37,377
I don't care about him.

300
00:18:37,464 --> 00:18:40,510
Right now, I'm thinking
it'd be all right to die

301
00:18:40,597 --> 00:18:42,991
if it meant I'd get
another night with you.

302
00:18:43,078 --> 00:18:47,169
Teddy, you know
we gotta play it safe.

303
00:18:47,256 --> 00:18:50,738
And you know
my father.

304
00:18:50,825 --> 00:18:53,828
There's something
that's been bothering me,

305
00:18:53,915 --> 00:18:57,962
'cause...

306
00:18:58,049 --> 00:19:00,617
I thought about
killing her.

307
00:19:00,704 --> 00:19:02,228
Your daughter?

308
00:19:02,315 --> 00:19:03,490
Yeah, who fucked
the nigger.

309
00:19:03,577 --> 00:19:06,145
Yeah. Vincent.

310
00:19:06,232 --> 00:19:08,625
Don't turn your back.

311
00:19:08,712 --> 00:19:12,586
She's the prodigal.

312
00:19:12,673 --> 00:19:17,765
Yeah, prodigal.

313
00:19:17,852 --> 00:19:19,158
Yeah, I remember
Sister Rose

314
00:19:19,245 --> 00:19:22,073
used to drill that story
into my head.

315
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:25,816
God often uses
the prodigals in our lives

316
00:19:25,903 --> 00:19:28,254
to bring us closer to him.

317
00:19:28,341 --> 00:19:31,735
They are the iron
that sharpens our faith.

318
00:19:31,822 --> 00:19:36,262
You cannot argue
your daughter back

319
00:19:36,349 --> 00:19:39,308
or shame her back.

320
00:19:39,395 --> 00:19:43,007
She won't come until God
decides it's done.

321
00:19:45,271 --> 00:19:47,534
I'll pray for it.

322
00:19:47,621 --> 00:19:52,278
One day...
just like the prodigal son...

323
00:19:52,365 --> 00:19:54,889
she will
come to her senses.

324
00:19:59,894 --> 00:20:02,201
Cheer up, Vincent.

325
00:20:02,288 --> 00:20:05,465
It'll all work out
in the end.

326
00:20:05,552 --> 00:20:07,771
Thanks, Louis.

327
00:20:07,858 --> 00:20:10,121
- I'll see you at Ma's next Sunday, right?
- Yeah.

328
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,254
She's making
the manigott and braciole.

329
00:20:12,341 --> 00:20:13,821
Nice.

330
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,874
Name and address.

331
00:20:23,961 --> 00:20:26,268
Name!

332
00:20:26,355 --> 00:20:28,401
Do I gotta beat it out
of you, nigger?

333
00:20:28,488 --> 00:20:31,142
You know who this is?

334
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,144
This is
Ellsworth Raymond Johnson.

335
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:36,409
D'Alessandro.
They made you captain?

336
00:20:36,496 --> 00:20:38,933
I thought you'd be on
foot patrol your whole career.

337
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:40,630
Hello, Johnson.

338
00:20:40,717 --> 00:20:43,807
I see you're back in cuffs,
where you belong.

339
00:20:43,894 --> 00:20:45,679
How's the house you bought
in the Jersey Shore

340
00:20:45,766 --> 00:20:47,463
with all that pat
that I used to pay you?

341
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:50,684
Bigger than a six-foot cell
on Alcatraz.

342
00:20:50,771 --> 00:20:53,643
He killed Feo Gomez,
Captain.

343
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:55,341
You killed Gomez?

344
00:20:55,428 --> 00:20:57,386
Come on.
They set me up.

345
00:20:57,473 --> 00:20:58,822
What the fuck are you
talking about?

346
00:20:58,909 --> 00:21:01,347
Vincent Gigante has it out
for my ass.

347
00:21:01,434 --> 00:21:04,959
I think that he hired your boys...

348
00:21:05,046 --> 00:21:07,266
to send me back to jail.Fuck you.

349
00:21:07,353 --> 00:21:08,789
You know what I hear?
You know what I hear?

350
00:21:08,876 --> 00:21:12,358
I hear that these --
these so-called detectives

351
00:21:12,445 --> 00:21:14,969
took over an arrest
on 125th

352
00:21:15,056 --> 00:21:18,364
in front of a whole crowd
of black folks.

353
00:21:18,451 --> 00:21:22,324
They arrested a Genovese courier
with three kilos,

354
00:21:22,411 --> 00:21:26,676
which I'm betting are no longer
in the evidence locker.

355
00:21:26,763 --> 00:21:29,288
That's Chin's dough.

356
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:32,508
So, I figure your boys...

357
00:21:33,901 --> 00:21:36,991
they're working with Chin.

358
00:21:41,648 --> 00:21:43,911
It's true what they say
about micks --

359
00:21:43,998 --> 00:21:47,523
featherweights.

360
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:51,919
Don't pack nothing
in a punch.

361
00:21:54,878 --> 00:21:57,011
If City Hall finds out

362
00:21:57,098 --> 00:22:00,710
that your cops are in
with the guineas,

363
00:22:00,797 --> 00:22:03,104
you're gonna have
an investigation

364
00:22:03,191 --> 00:22:08,544
that brings this
whole precinct down.

365
00:22:08,631 --> 00:22:09,545
This is clean, right?

366
00:22:09,632 --> 00:22:11,417
Damn right, it is.

367
00:22:11,504 --> 00:22:14,420
Weapon with prints?

368
00:22:14,507 --> 00:22:15,769
He wiped 'em.

369
00:22:19,425 --> 00:22:22,166
Make it stick.

370
00:22:22,253 --> 00:22:23,472
I need my phone call,
D'Alessandro.

371
00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:24,734
I want my phone call.

372
00:22:24,821 --> 00:22:27,041
Fuck you!

373
00:22:27,128 --> 00:22:29,348
You want the case
to stick?

374
00:22:29,435 --> 00:22:32,568
Give the man
his phone call.

375
00:22:43,144 --> 00:22:46,408
I remember one day
back in '47,

376
00:22:46,495 --> 00:22:50,456
I ran into your father in front
of the Woolworth's on 125th.

377
00:22:50,543 --> 00:22:53,546
He pointed to my reflection
in that plate glass window

378
00:22:53,633 --> 00:22:55,548
and laughed at me.

379
00:22:55,635 --> 00:22:57,158
Yeah.

380
00:22:57,245 --> 00:23:01,467
I had my zoot suit on,
my hair conked red.

381
00:23:01,554 --> 00:23:03,425
"Boy, get your
bow-legged black ass

382
00:23:03,512 --> 00:23:06,733
outta Harlem."

383
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:11,346
So I went up to Boston,
did more foolish things...

384
00:23:12,956 --> 00:23:17,004
...but his words
set me on the path.

385
00:23:17,091 --> 00:23:22,139
If I can change,
you can, too.

386
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:26,274
When Daddy was inside,

387
00:23:26,361 --> 00:23:29,103
I thought of him
in that little cell,

388
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:32,498
and it made me cry.

389
00:23:32,585 --> 00:23:35,065
I wrote him a letter,
told him I was clean,

390
00:23:35,152 --> 00:23:38,634
I had a job.
I was all right.

391
00:23:38,721 --> 00:23:41,594
And I was lying.

392
00:23:41,681 --> 00:23:44,901
I wrote that letter
high as a kite.

393
00:23:47,077 --> 00:23:50,037
Y'all allowed to
smoke reefer in Islam?

394
00:23:50,124 --> 00:23:51,995
I could use a reefer.

395
00:23:52,082 --> 00:23:53,519
No, Sister.

396
00:23:53,606 --> 00:23:54,955
We Muslims are forbidden

397
00:23:55,042 --> 00:23:58,524
all substances
that dull the mind.

398
00:23:58,611 --> 00:24:01,222
Then it ain't
gonna work.

399
00:24:01,309 --> 00:24:03,877
I ain't been clean
since I was 12.

400
00:24:03,964 --> 00:24:05,661
That's all right.

401
00:24:05,748 --> 00:24:08,359
Sister Marny got you beat.

402
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:11,537
She was addicted straight
out of the womb.

403
00:24:11,624 --> 00:24:13,234
No matter what
your story is...

404
00:24:13,321 --> 00:24:15,671
someone got worser.

405
00:24:15,758 --> 00:24:19,675
Your struggle, Elise,

406
00:24:19,762 --> 00:24:23,157
is to find <i>why
you use narcotics.</i>

407
00:24:23,244 --> 00:24:26,726
Feels better than
anything I ever felt.

408
00:24:26,813 --> 00:24:30,860
Feels like God.

409
00:24:30,947 --> 00:24:34,647
Do you feel God...
on those cold-turkey mornings,

410
00:24:34,734 --> 00:24:37,737
searching the streets for
someone who might be holding?

411
00:24:37,824 --> 00:24:42,829
Do you feel God in the white man
who ushers you into his car

412
00:24:42,916 --> 00:24:46,310
and treats your body
like a garbage can?

413
00:24:50,053 --> 00:24:52,055
Fulfill that letter.

414
00:24:53,448 --> 00:24:55,145
Get clean.

415
00:24:55,232 --> 00:24:56,756
Get a job.

416
00:24:56,843 --> 00:25:01,282
Get all right.

417
00:25:01,369 --> 00:25:04,677
I have faith
in you, Elise.

418
00:25:09,812 --> 00:25:12,598
Those cops really
set me up good.

419
00:25:12,685 --> 00:25:16,079
Chin accused you
of killing Richie Zambrano,

420
00:25:16,166 --> 00:25:16,993
and now this.

421
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,429
To top it all off,

422
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:20,997
you want to organize
the Negroes in Harlem.

423
00:25:21,084 --> 00:25:22,782
I got a right
to do my business.

424
00:25:22,869 --> 00:25:23,739
Rights...

425
00:25:23,826 --> 00:25:25,001
Funny thing about you

426
00:25:25,088 --> 00:25:26,176
and your people
and "rights."

427
00:25:26,263 --> 00:25:27,787
We all got rights.

428
00:25:27,874 --> 00:25:31,094
And Chin has a right
to protect his territory?

429
00:25:31,181 --> 00:25:33,009
So do I.

430
00:25:33,096 --> 00:25:36,796
Look, the more you go at him,
the more he will have ammunition

431
00:25:36,883 --> 00:25:40,451
to convince the Families
that you are a liability.

432
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:42,018
Chin's gonna keep
coming at me,

433
00:25:42,105 --> 00:25:44,630
no matter what
the Families say.

434
00:25:47,023 --> 00:25:49,635
Did you kill Zambrano?

435
00:25:54,683 --> 00:25:56,642
Of course not.

436
00:25:56,729 --> 00:25:58,731
He's a made man.

437
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:06,652
Bumpy, I didn't know my phone was tapped!

438
00:26:06,739 --> 00:26:10,656
I should fuck you up, Guapo!
Bump, Bump, I'm sorry.

439
00:26:10,743 --> 00:26:13,397
How those motherfuckers
got a-a bug in my phone,

440
00:26:13,484 --> 00:26:14,964
I-I-I don't know.

441
00:26:15,051 --> 00:26:17,140
I'm the one who's been in jail
for 11 years.

442
00:26:17,227 --> 00:26:19,969
You're supposed to be up on what
the flatfoots are doing, man!

443
00:26:20,056 --> 00:26:21,797
Yeah, all this modern
technological shit

444
00:26:21,884 --> 00:26:23,669
is making me crazy, man.

445
00:26:23,756 --> 00:26:25,496
I had to drop 20 large
on that judge.

446
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:27,150
I'll pay you back.

447
00:26:27,237 --> 00:26:30,589
No, man, I'm not asking you
to pay my bills.

448
00:26:33,766 --> 00:26:35,942
I can't keep control the streets
without drugs.

449
00:26:36,029 --> 00:26:37,813
I need the duji.

450
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:40,207
Given that you
just got popped,

451
00:26:40,294 --> 00:26:43,819
you think it's a good idea
you should be scoring right now?

452
00:26:43,906 --> 00:26:46,082
They won't be watching me
now that I'm out on bail.

453
00:26:46,169 --> 00:26:48,084
These cops, man,
they're fucking animals.

454
00:26:48,171 --> 00:26:51,000
They're robbing
and killing dealers.

455
00:26:51,087 --> 00:26:54,003
I mean, there's more smack
in that evidence room

456
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:57,659
than anywhere on
Pleasant Avenue.

457
00:26:57,746 --> 00:27:00,096
They're selling dope.

458
00:27:00,183 --> 00:27:02,011
Kill one dealer,

459
00:27:02,098 --> 00:27:05,275
sell their stash
to another.

460
00:27:05,362 --> 00:27:09,062
These cops are competing
with the guineas.

461
00:27:13,719 --> 00:27:15,242
We could've squeezed Feo Gomez

462
00:27:15,329 --> 00:27:16,809
for another 10 years.

463
00:27:16,896 --> 00:27:18,854
Instead, you gotta kill
that fuckin' spic

464
00:27:18,941 --> 00:27:20,290
and saddle up
with Gigante?

465
00:27:20,377 --> 00:27:22,728
Do not listen
to Ellsworth Johnson.

466
00:27:22,815 --> 00:27:24,686
Bumpy's right.

467
00:27:24,773 --> 00:27:26,296
If City Hall finds out
about this, we're fucked.

468
00:27:26,383 --> 00:27:28,690
They ain't gonna. 
Shut up, you fuckin' paddy!

469
00:27:28,777 --> 00:27:30,170
You shut up!

470
00:27:30,257 --> 00:27:31,780
We're not working
with the guineas.

471
00:27:31,867 --> 00:27:33,652
You got a precinct
full of coppers

472
00:27:33,739 --> 00:27:36,785
who give you a piece
of every score.

473
00:27:36,872 --> 00:27:39,832
Back the fuck off,
or you'll end up

474
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:41,877
with a bullet in the back
of your fuckin' head.

475
00:27:41,964 --> 00:27:43,749
You got that?

476
00:27:51,887 --> 00:27:54,542
I still can't understand
why you stole the drugs.

477
00:27:54,629 --> 00:27:56,065
I'm sorry, Daddy.

478
00:27:56,152 --> 00:27:58,024
Yeah, I don't know what
you were thinking.

479
00:27:58,111 --> 00:27:59,460
Well, Teddy
had a contact

480
00:27:59,547 --> 00:28:01,114
who could sell it
on the street.

481
00:28:01,201 --> 00:28:04,334
So we figured we could turn
a key into 40 grand,

482
00:28:04,421 --> 00:28:08,164
and then buy a new key
to replace it.

483
00:28:08,251 --> 00:28:09,513
So I went
to Aunt Carola's.

484
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,428
When she was
in the kitchen,

485
00:28:11,515 --> 00:28:13,126
I went to that -- that closet
where you keep it hidden.

486
00:28:13,213 --> 00:28:14,780
How the fuck do you know
any of this shit?

487
00:28:14,867 --> 00:28:16,520
Daddy, I have eyes,
and I have a brain.

488
00:28:16,607 --> 00:28:17,783
What, so you steal
from your family

489
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:18,914
like the fuckin' niggers do?

490
00:28:19,001 --> 00:28:20,873
Dad!

491
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,831
Forgive me.

492
00:28:25,268 --> 00:28:27,053
Where is he?

493
00:28:31,622 --> 00:28:34,538
Where is he?

494
00:28:34,625 --> 00:28:35,844
I don't know.

495
00:28:35,931 --> 00:28:36,889
Meaning what?
I don't know.

496
00:28:36,976 --> 00:28:38,847
It's over with us.

497
00:28:42,198 --> 00:28:44,418
I swear.

498
00:28:47,421 --> 00:28:50,816
So, what, you got,
like, a...

499
00:28:50,903 --> 00:28:52,731
You got, like,
a thing for black guys,

500
00:28:52,818 --> 00:28:56,865
or, what, this was
one time?

501
00:28:56,952 --> 00:28:58,780
It was...

502
00:28:58,867 --> 00:29:00,434
It was his music.

503
00:29:00,521 --> 00:29:01,914
You know I love music.

504
00:29:02,001 --> 00:29:06,440
And he has this beautiful voice.

505
00:29:08,485 --> 00:29:10,879
So does Sinatra.

506
00:29:14,013 --> 00:29:15,928
Frank Nunzi's son...

507
00:29:16,015 --> 00:29:17,364
he always had
the warms for you.

508
00:29:17,451 --> 00:29:19,801
He's a good kid.

509
00:29:19,888 --> 00:29:21,411
You remember Ernie.

510
00:29:21,498 --> 00:29:24,850
He's doing well
for himself.

511
00:29:24,937 --> 00:29:27,113
You want my forgiveness?

512
00:29:29,898 --> 00:29:31,770
You let him
take you out.

513
00:29:38,907 --> 00:29:41,040
Alright.

514
00:29:41,127 --> 00:29:42,868
Reverend Powell...

515
00:29:42,955 --> 00:29:45,218
all people talk about
is Martin Luther King,

516
00:29:45,305 --> 00:29:48,699
but you are the true force
behind civil rights legislation.

517
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:50,789
Well, I can't thank you enough
for pushing through

518
00:29:50,876 --> 00:29:52,660
the Harlem Youth
Opportunities Act.

519
00:29:52,747 --> 00:29:55,184
The work I am doing with
the HARYOU organization

520
00:29:55,271 --> 00:29:58,057
is essential to the youth
in our community.

521
00:29:58,144 --> 00:30:00,624
Well, the committee couldn't
have made a better choice

522
00:30:00,711 --> 00:30:02,191
in making you
the fundraising chair.

523
00:30:02,278 --> 00:30:03,584
Or...

524
00:30:03,671 --> 00:30:05,891
a more lovely one,
Mrs. Johnson.

525
00:30:05,978 --> 00:30:08,023
I've got the boxer
Doug Jones' support.

526
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:09,808
He's going to donate
his gloves for auction

527
00:30:09,895 --> 00:30:11,897
after his fight
with Cassius Clay.

528
00:30:11,984 --> 00:30:15,857
But we are still facing
a significant operating deficit.

529
00:30:15,944 --> 00:30:18,642
Well, I must be honest
with you, Mayme.

530
00:30:18,729 --> 00:30:21,471
Is it all right
if I call you Mayme?

531
00:30:21,558 --> 00:30:26,476
I have squeezed every last dime
out of Washington on this one.

532
00:30:26,563 --> 00:30:29,001
I can't get another dime
for HARYOU.

533
00:30:29,088 --> 00:30:32,656
There are thousands of children
depending on these programs.

534
00:30:32,743 --> 00:30:33,962
And if we can't
get more funding,

535
00:30:34,049 --> 00:30:35,834
we'll have to
shut some down.

536
00:30:35,921 --> 00:30:37,879
You're known as the man
who can get things done

537
00:30:37,966 --> 00:30:41,056
in Washington.

538
00:30:41,143 --> 00:30:44,407
You know, I'm... I'm terribly sorry.

539
00:30:44,494 --> 00:30:47,062
I hate to disappoint you.

540
00:30:47,149 --> 00:30:51,893
But I've squeezed
all the money I can.

541
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:55,288
I am so happy you got
back on the ballot,

542
00:30:55,375 --> 00:30:59,553
what with all the work you do
to serve the people.

543
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,903
You know, Bumpy mentioned he put
in a word with Frank Costello,

544
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:04,775
and your problems
with Tammany Hall went away.

545
00:31:08,301 --> 00:31:12,958
Let me see what I can do,
digging up some more funding.

546
00:31:13,045 --> 00:31:15,308
Good day, Mrs. Johnson.

547
00:31:15,395 --> 00:31:17,571
Good day.

548
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:21,967
<i>Let us toss the gauntlet
before the feet of tyranny,</i>

549
00:31:22,054 --> 00:31:26,928
<i>and I say, segregation now,
segregation tomorrow,</i>

550
00:31:27,015 --> 00:31:29,539
<i>and segregation forever.</i>

551
00:31:33,761 --> 00:31:37,330
<i>The Washington, D.C.,
school riot report</i>

552
00:31:37,417 --> 00:31:40,376
<i>is disgusting and revealing.</i>

553
00:31:40,463 --> 00:31:43,292
<i>We will not sacrifice
our children</i>

554
00:31:43,379 --> 00:31:46,252
<i>to any such type
school system --</i>

555
00:31:46,339 --> 00:31:49,124
<i>and you can write that down.</i>

556
00:31:49,211 --> 00:31:50,909
Why you watching
that cracker?

557
00:31:50,996 --> 00:31:53,259
We're waiting for "Wagon Train"
to come on.

558
00:31:53,346 --> 00:31:56,131
We always watch "Wagon Train"
on Wednesdays.Okay.

559
00:31:56,218 --> 00:31:59,134
- Honey, I have to talk to your father.
- Mama...

560
00:31:59,221 --> 00:32:01,658
We'll watch it next week, baby.

561
00:32:05,184 --> 00:32:08,796
For you.

562
00:32:08,883 --> 00:32:10,798
Thank you.

563
00:32:12,104 --> 00:32:14,149
And I got something for you,
too, little one.

564
00:32:22,853 --> 00:32:24,986
I found a Negro doll.

565
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,991
Thank you.

566
00:32:31,166 --> 00:32:32,951
I guess I'll go do
my homework now.

567
00:32:33,038 --> 00:32:35,040
Alright.

568
00:32:37,607 --> 00:32:40,001
We gave all her dolls

569
00:32:40,088 --> 00:32:43,787
to the Handmaidens of Mary
two years ago.

570
00:32:43,874 --> 00:32:45,789
So, what does she
like to do now?

571
00:32:45,876 --> 00:32:47,052
Read books.

572
00:32:47,139 --> 00:32:49,054
Just like you.

573
00:32:51,534 --> 00:32:53,188
Okay.

574
00:33:11,293 --> 00:33:13,078
Chance called.

575
00:33:16,298 --> 00:33:19,127
I got jammed up.

576
00:33:19,214 --> 00:33:21,086
How'd you
get out?

577
00:33:21,173 --> 00:33:26,569
Costello got
a judge downtown.

578
00:33:26,656 --> 00:33:28,571
Look, you always think
three moves ahead,

579
00:33:28,658 --> 00:33:31,270
but the landscape is
different now.

580
00:33:31,357 --> 00:33:34,403
You have got to take that
into account.

581
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:36,231
Now I know.

582
00:33:36,318 --> 00:33:38,799
Honestly, I --
I don't know what's with you.

583
00:33:38,886 --> 00:33:41,671
Getting roped by police,
taking Elise off the street.

584
00:33:41,758 --> 00:33:43,195
Elise? What does Elise
got to do with this?

585
00:33:43,282 --> 00:33:45,806
What is your plan,
Ellsworth?

586
00:33:45,893 --> 00:33:49,244
If she stays clean,
which I doubt,

587
00:33:49,331 --> 00:33:51,507
what's she gonna do?

588
00:33:51,594 --> 00:33:53,205
What, is she gonna
show up here?

589
00:33:53,292 --> 00:33:55,294
Want to be some
kind of mother?

590
00:33:55,381 --> 00:33:57,078
I'll take care
of that, alright?

591
00:33:57,165 --> 00:33:59,298
You keep her away
from Margaret.

592
00:33:59,385 --> 00:34:03,693
For the child's sake.

593
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:06,044
You understand?

594
00:34:18,795 --> 00:34:21,494
I used to feel
the street.

595
00:34:21,581 --> 00:34:25,150
It used to whisper in my ear,
you know?

596
00:34:25,237 --> 00:34:28,240
But I can't feel nothing
right now.

597
00:34:28,327 --> 00:34:30,851
That'll come back.

598
00:34:30,938 --> 00:34:35,160
Youngbloods out there,
guys in their 30s,

599
00:34:35,247 --> 00:34:37,118
hungry like I was.

600
00:34:39,555 --> 00:34:41,905
I'm outta step.

601
00:34:43,994 --> 00:34:48,216
I don't know if you can
teach old dogs a new trick.

602
00:34:48,303 --> 00:34:49,565
But sometimes you can

603
00:34:49,652 --> 00:34:52,133
fool a new dog
with an old one.

604
00:34:55,354 --> 00:34:57,138
Come here.

605
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:16,026
Hey, little one.

606
00:35:19,769 --> 00:35:22,511
Daddy?

607
00:35:22,598 --> 00:35:26,341
How you doing,
little girl?

608
00:35:26,428 --> 00:35:29,127
Okay, I guess.

609
00:35:29,214 --> 00:35:31,694
You look --
You look good.

610
00:35:35,263 --> 00:35:38,048
After you leave here,

611
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:40,573
I'm gonna set you up
with a --

612
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:44,142
an apartment...

613
00:35:44,229 --> 00:35:47,232
money for food...

614
00:35:47,319 --> 00:35:48,798
a job.

615
00:35:52,802 --> 00:35:55,849
Been years out there,

616
00:35:55,936 --> 00:36:00,375
eating outta bins,
having hell inside my skull.

617
00:36:06,425 --> 00:36:08,209
I want to get better.

618
00:36:10,385 --> 00:36:12,953
You will.

619
00:36:16,696 --> 00:36:19,438
I want to see my daughter.

620
00:36:19,525 --> 00:36:22,310
I want to see Margaret.

621
00:36:22,397 --> 00:36:24,617
Down the road,

622
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:27,663
you will.

623
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:31,754
She's all
I think about --

624
00:36:31,841 --> 00:36:33,669
seeing her...

625
00:36:33,756 --> 00:36:38,283
talking to her,
holding her.

626
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:44,071
I sit here, remembering
what she smelled like.

627
00:36:44,158 --> 00:36:47,117
What she sounded like
when she was happy.

628
00:36:51,948 --> 00:36:54,255
What did you
tell her about me?

629
00:36:57,476 --> 00:37:00,305
What you want me
to say to her?

630
00:37:00,392 --> 00:37:02,002
I mean, she's just --
she's just a little girl.

631
00:37:02,089 --> 00:37:05,266
She don't need to know
all this kind of stuff.

632
00:37:05,353 --> 00:37:07,268
You know?

633
00:37:15,145 --> 00:37:17,278
Margaret don't know
I'm her mama.

634
00:37:20,499 --> 00:37:22,805
She was just a year old
when we took her in.

635
00:37:22,892 --> 00:37:24,590
Mayme thought
that it was best

636
00:37:24,677 --> 00:37:28,420
for her to think that
we were her folks.

637
00:37:28,507 --> 00:37:30,857
That bitch been playin' house
with my kid for 11 years?

638
00:37:30,944 --> 00:37:32,641
She raised the child
that you gave away

639
00:37:32,728 --> 00:37:34,077
when you chose
that needle!

640
00:37:34,164 --> 00:37:36,297
Get out of here.

641
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:37,733
I'm sorry. Look.

642
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:39,474
Elise... get the fuck out of here!

643
00:37:39,561 --> 00:37:41,737
Leave her alone. 
Hey, what are you doing?

644
00:37:41,824 --> 00:37:44,349
Excuse me.
This is my daughter, alright?

645
00:37:44,436 --> 00:37:47,134
I'm gonna go by.

646
00:37:57,579 --> 00:37:59,712
She's just so angry.

647
00:37:59,799 --> 00:38:03,368
Well, she's going
through detox, Bumpy.

648
00:38:03,455 --> 00:38:05,370
Junkies are fools.

649
00:38:05,457 --> 00:38:06,980
You saw that,
so you got clean.

650
00:38:07,067 --> 00:38:08,286
Why can't she see?

651
00:38:08,373 --> 00:38:11,376
Well, I identified the causes.

652
00:38:11,463 --> 00:38:14,683
My addiction was born out
of intense lack of self-esteem

653
00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:17,077
and childhood trauma.

654
00:38:20,646 --> 00:38:22,387
I wasn't a good father,

655
00:38:22,474 --> 00:38:24,127
alright?

656
00:38:24,214 --> 00:38:27,392
I was too busy trying
to make a dime.

657
00:38:27,479 --> 00:38:28,741
Hey, I'm hip to the game,
brother,

658
00:38:28,828 --> 00:38:32,527
but don't you realize
the hypocrisy?

659
00:38:32,614 --> 00:38:34,355
I didn't put a needle
in nobody's arm.

660
00:38:34,442 --> 00:38:35,922
That's their choice.

661
00:38:36,009 --> 00:38:38,359
Was it her choice
her father wasn't around?

662
00:38:38,446 --> 00:38:40,796
If we could do things over...
the world would be

663
00:38:40,883 --> 00:38:43,538
a better place, now,
wouldn't it?

664
00:38:43,625 --> 00:38:45,410
I have never said
the path was easy,

665
00:38:45,497 --> 00:38:46,976
but it's simple.

666
00:38:49,239 --> 00:38:52,242
No offense, Malcolm,

667
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:55,942
I don't see Elise
becoming a Muslim.

668
00:38:56,029 --> 00:38:59,728
How do you see her?

669
00:38:59,815 --> 00:39:03,906
Or do you see her
at all?

670
00:39:03,993 --> 00:39:05,473
What's that supposed
to mean?

671
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:09,172
Who is she to you?

672
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:33,588
Hey, Stell.
What's kickin'?

673
00:39:33,675 --> 00:39:35,590
Ernie Nunzi.
You grew.

674
00:39:35,677 --> 00:39:38,593
You, too.
You're even more beautiful.

675
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:40,595
I haven't seen you
since Loyola.

676
00:39:40,682 --> 00:39:42,510
I'm better-lookin'.

677
00:39:42,597 --> 00:39:44,077
Better car.

678
00:40:00,659 --> 00:40:02,095
This a Volkswagen?

679
00:40:02,182 --> 00:40:04,445
They had to get
with the times.

680
00:40:04,532 --> 00:40:05,881
It's a Karmann Ghia.

681
00:40:05,968 --> 00:40:07,622
So, where to?

682
00:40:07,709 --> 00:40:09,015
The Village, maybe?

683
00:40:09,102 --> 00:40:11,800
Listen to some
Negro music?

684
00:40:11,887 --> 00:40:13,802
You like Negro music?

685
00:40:13,889 --> 00:40:16,631
Smokey Robinson,
The Shirelles --

686
00:40:16,718 --> 00:40:18,503
I'm not a wop who can't
listen to nothing

687
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:21,506
but Damone and Sinatra.

688
00:40:21,593 --> 00:40:23,072
Where you wanna go?

689
00:41:11,033 --> 00:41:13,645
Your old man just wants
what's best for you.

690
00:41:13,732 --> 00:41:16,561
He doesn't know what's best --
he's got millions of dollars,

691
00:41:16,648 --> 00:41:19,694
and his idea of a vacation
is to roll up his pants

692
00:41:19,781 --> 00:41:21,870
and wade in the water
at Ocean Park.

693
00:41:21,957 --> 00:41:24,307
What's
wrong with that?

694
00:41:25,787 --> 00:41:27,702
What's wrong with that?

695
00:41:27,789 --> 00:41:29,574
He's got no interest
in the world

696
00:41:29,661 --> 00:41:32,533
outside Pleasant Avenue.

697
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:35,188
Pleasant Avenue <i>is</i>his world.
Little Italy, too.

698
00:41:37,016 --> 00:41:40,541
It's who he is.

699
00:41:44,676 --> 00:41:48,549
Thank you. Thank you!

700
00:41:48,636 --> 00:41:49,724
Thank you.

701
00:41:52,771 --> 00:41:54,599
You mind if I go
to the ladies'?

702
00:41:54,686 --> 00:41:56,514
Of course.

703
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:01,780
Hey, Lionel.

704
00:42:03,782 --> 00:42:04,692
Hey, Lionel.
Hey.

705
00:42:04,739 --> 00:42:05,704
Hey, it was a great set.

706
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:06,915
Thank you.

707
00:42:07,002 --> 00:42:08,743
Have you heard
from Teddy?

708
00:42:08,830 --> 00:42:11,529
I talked to my auntie
in Charleston.

709
00:42:11,616 --> 00:42:13,618
She says he misses you
something awful.

710
00:42:13,705 --> 00:42:15,576
Really?

711
00:42:15,663 --> 00:42:17,317
Alright, gorgeous,

712
00:42:17,404 --> 00:42:18,797
I gotta split
for my next gig.

713
00:42:18,884 --> 00:42:20,668
They're gonna love you.

714
00:43:18,857 --> 00:43:20,380
Wallet was in the car.

715
00:43:20,467 --> 00:43:22,208
Drinks are cheap here.

716
00:43:40,530 --> 00:43:43,533
Hands up,
motherfucker.

717
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:45,535
Just here to see Chin.

718
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:46,711
Yeah.

719
00:43:46,798 --> 00:43:48,408
Yeah, wait.
No, wait.

720
00:43:50,062 --> 00:43:52,717
No, no, no.
It's okay.

721
00:43:52,804 --> 00:43:57,112
Yeah.
Alright.

722
00:43:57,199 --> 00:43:59,549
To what do I owe
the pleasure?

723
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:01,464
You broke our agreement.

724
00:44:01,551 --> 00:44:05,033
Which was that I was free
to operate in Harlem.

725
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:08,036
Yeah, well,
not at my expense.

726
00:44:08,123 --> 00:44:10,473
Come.
Sit down.

727
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,693
You want espresso?

728
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,006
So, why are you here?

729
00:44:21,093 --> 00:44:23,530
I was sentenced
to 11 years

730
00:44:23,617 --> 00:44:27,795
on a drug deal
that your people fucked up.

731
00:44:27,882 --> 00:44:31,059
I could've walked in two
if I'd have snitched.

732
00:44:31,146 --> 00:44:34,323
Now you're framing me

733
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:35,498
with the cops.

734
00:44:35,585 --> 00:44:37,762
Come on.

735
00:44:37,849 --> 00:44:40,155
You kidnapped my daughter.

736
00:44:40,242 --> 00:44:43,942
You forced me to cover for you
for killing Richie Zambrano.

737
00:44:44,029 --> 00:44:48,033
I can speak just as much truth
as you, Johnson.

738
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:50,688
You want truth?

739
00:44:50,775 --> 00:44:53,908
That might be the only thing
we have in common.

740
00:44:53,995 --> 00:44:56,781
You and me are gonna be at war

741
00:44:56,868 --> 00:44:59,348
till one of us is dead.

742
00:44:59,435 --> 00:45:02,525
That, my Negro friend,

743
00:45:02,612 --> 00:45:04,789
is the truth.

744
00:45:04,876 --> 00:45:08,967
If you continue
to use the cops against me,

745
00:45:09,054 --> 00:45:13,362
I am going to retaliate
against you.

746
00:45:17,453 --> 00:45:18,933
Sully.

747
00:45:32,817 --> 00:45:35,297
You killed Richie Zambrano.
It's a made man.

748
00:45:35,384 --> 00:45:38,083
Costello covered for you
with the Families.

749
00:45:38,170 --> 00:45:40,172
And I'm not allowed
to touch you,

750
00:45:40,259 --> 00:45:43,828
but it could come out.

751
00:45:43,915 --> 00:45:45,960
And when it does,
I will be there

752
00:45:46,047 --> 00:45:50,922
with a fuckin' bone saw
to cut your fuckin' hands off.

753
00:45:51,009 --> 00:45:53,838
Zambrano?

754
00:45:53,925 --> 00:45:55,927
Who's that?

755
00:45:56,014 --> 00:45:57,842
I mean, you want me to put
the word out on the street

756
00:45:57,929 --> 00:45:59,539
to find out who did him?

757
00:45:59,626 --> 00:46:01,106
I will.

758
00:46:01,193 --> 00:46:04,457
In fact...

759
00:46:04,544 --> 00:46:06,589
"JK5...

760
00:46:06,676 --> 00:46:08,940
0175."

761
00:46:12,508 --> 00:46:15,468
Now I got your number.

762
00:46:15,555 --> 00:46:17,862
And I know how
to reach you.

763
00:46:30,309 --> 00:46:33,225
Still don't know why you wanted
to go see Chin.

764
00:46:33,312 --> 00:46:36,968
His number might
come in handy.

765
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:39,057
How?

766
00:46:39,144 --> 00:46:41,581
If we can't get duji
from the guineas,

767
00:46:41,668 --> 00:46:44,018
we need to get it from
the next best source.

768
00:46:44,105 --> 00:46:45,628
And who's that?

769
00:46:45,715 --> 00:46:47,456
The NYPD.

770
00:46:51,983 --> 00:46:54,202
Listen.

771
00:46:54,289 --> 00:46:56,030
You just follow my instructions
to the letter.

772
00:46:56,117 --> 00:46:57,640
If we pull this off,

773
00:46:57,727 --> 00:46:59,817
there's a lot of money
for both of us.

774
00:46:59,904 --> 00:47:02,994
You just got to do
what I say, a'ight?

775
00:47:03,081 --> 00:47:06,040
Sometimes to be the new dog,

776
00:47:06,127 --> 00:47:08,434
you need an old trick.

777
00:47:37,028 --> 00:47:38,943
Hello?

778
00:47:39,030 --> 00:47:41,075
<i>Mrs. Johnson, I was just calling to say</i>

779
00:47:41,162 --> 00:47:44,862
that we looked under a rock,
and I found more funding...

780
00:47:44,949 --> 00:47:47,342
for your Harlem Youth Advancement project.

781
00:47:47,429 --> 00:47:48,691
<i>Why, thank you.</i>

782
00:47:48,778 --> 00:47:50,955
<i>$10,000, to be exact.</i>

783
00:47:51,042 --> 00:47:52,870
I appreciate it.

784
00:47:52,957 --> 00:47:54,959
<i>Drugs are the scourge
of our community,</i>

785
00:47:55,046 --> 00:47:56,830
<i>and whatever can be done</i>

786
00:47:56,917 --> 00:47:58,919
<i>to mitigate the problem
must be done.</i>

787
00:47:59,006 --> 00:48:01,008
Our children's lives
are at stake.

788
00:49:24,048 --> 00:49:28,400
Just a second.

789
00:49:28,487 --> 00:49:30,837
Just a second!

790
00:49:37,148 --> 00:49:38,540
I'm here to see Margaret.

791
00:49:38,627 --> 00:49:40,107
No.

792
00:49:40,194 --> 00:49:42,066
I got a right to see her.
She's my daughter.

793
00:49:42,153 --> 00:49:44,982
The hell she is.

794
00:49:45,069 --> 00:49:47,593
I took that poor,
innocent little baby,

795
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:49,160
and I raised her.

796
00:49:49,247 --> 00:49:52,859
Sang to her, read to her,
changed her diapers,

797
00:49:52,946 --> 00:49:54,904
washed her clothes,
cooked her dinner.

798
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:57,472
Don't matter what
you did for her.

799
00:49:57,559 --> 00:49:59,213
You ain't her mother, Mayme.

800
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:00,562
I am.

801
00:50:00,649 --> 00:50:02,608
You ain't no mother.

802
00:50:02,695 --> 00:50:05,785
You are nothing.

803
00:50:05,872 --> 00:50:08,092
I'm her mama.

804
00:50:08,179 --> 00:50:11,660
Hold on.

805
00:50:11,747 --> 00:50:13,227
I got something for you.

806
00:50:24,369 --> 00:50:26,153
Here.

807
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:27,502
$100.

808
00:50:27,589 --> 00:50:29,069
You think you
can buy me?

809
00:50:29,156 --> 00:50:31,115
I know I can.

810
00:50:31,202 --> 00:50:34,161
You bitch!

811
00:50:35,249 --> 00:50:37,251
Don't move.

812
00:50:43,823 --> 00:50:46,608
Take it.

813
00:50:46,695 --> 00:50:48,175
Take it.

814
00:51:18,814 --> 00:51:21,165
Old dogs.
New tricks.

815
00:51:21,252 --> 00:51:24,733
$20,000 down.

816
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:26,474
When do I get
the rest?

817
00:51:26,561 --> 00:51:29,477
I'll cut the duji, bag it,
take it down to the street.

818
00:51:29,564 --> 00:51:31,349
You'll get $300K
in two, three weeks.

819
00:51:31,436 --> 00:51:33,786
Kramer was gonna
make a move on me.

820
00:51:33,873 --> 00:51:35,179
Did you put down his badge number?

821
00:51:35,266 --> 00:51:36,745
Fellas,
if I stole the dope,

822
00:51:36,832 --> 00:51:39,139
I wouldn't leave
my fucking badge.

823
00:51:39,226 --> 00:51:40,749
Then why do you have Chin's number?

824
00:51:40,836 --> 00:51:42,316
Fuck that.

825
00:51:47,365 --> 00:51:48,888
Old dogs gotta move fast.

826
00:51:48,975 --> 00:51:50,716
Yeah.

827
00:52:06,601 --> 00:52:08,125
You were right.

828
00:52:08,212 --> 00:52:10,518
She led me straight
to that nigger boyfriend.

829
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:14,245
Took care of it?

830
00:52:14,305 --> 00:52:15,362
He's gone.

831
00:52:17,438 --> 00:52:18,613
New York City.

832
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:20,224
125th Street.

833
00:52:36,370 --> 00:52:39,721
Take me home.

834
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:05,269
You motherfucker.

835
00:53:05,356 --> 00:53:06,966
Next time, I'll kill her.

835
00:53:07,305 --> 00:54:07,688
