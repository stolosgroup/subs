2
00:00:17,321 --> 00:00:20,150
My successorwill be you, my son.

3
00:00:20,194 --> 00:00:22,718
You don't need to antagonize
the government.

4
00:00:22,761 --> 00:00:24,328
You got enough enemieswithout 'em.

5
00:00:24,372 --> 00:00:27,157
I watched tenants be brutalized
and did nothing.

6
00:00:27,201 --> 00:00:28,811
Seeing you,
Mayme, and Margaret

7
00:00:28,854 --> 00:00:31,248
standing there together, it was
like Heaven on Earth for me.

8
00:00:31,292 --> 00:00:33,294
Margaret is notmy biological daughter.

9
00:00:33,337 --> 00:00:36,253
She's Elise's. Bumpy isMargaret's grandfather.

10
00:00:36,297 --> 00:00:38,777
I need your consent to
legally adopt Margaret.

11
00:00:38,821 --> 00:00:40,475
I can't give up my child.

12
00:00:40,518 --> 00:00:44,087
Finally found out the owners
of Bowery Lane Holdings.

13
00:00:44,131 --> 00:00:47,090
And here's one.
Johnson.

14
00:00:47,134 --> 00:00:49,005
Every man has a legacy,

15
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:50,833
whether they want one or not.

16
00:00:50,876 --> 00:00:52,139
Let's get the bus
to California.

17
00:00:52,182 --> 00:00:53,488
This is everything
we worked towards.

18
00:00:53,531 --> 00:00:55,011
It's finally coming true.

19
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,534
Don't you see this girl
is gonna get you killed?

20
00:00:56,578 --> 00:00:58,232
Mama,shut your damn mouth!

21
00:00:58,275 --> 00:00:59,929
-She's right.
-It's over, Teddy.

22
00:00:59,972 --> 00:01:01,409
I'd rather give you upthan see you dead.

23
00:01:01,452 --> 00:01:03,628
Stella!
How many did you take?!

24
00:01:03,672 --> 00:01:04,977
Stella!

25
00:01:05,021 --> 00:01:06,849
You're a monster.

26
00:01:06,892 --> 00:01:09,199
Will you leave Teddy alone?

27
00:01:09,243 --> 00:01:11,158
Tell me what happened
to Lorenzo.

28
00:01:11,201 --> 00:01:14,291
You killed Joe's son. 'Cause
he was fucking your daughter!

29
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:18,165
Bumpy has never lied to me,
not even once.

30
00:01:18,208 --> 00:01:20,123
If I convince you thatJohnson killed Zambrano,

31
00:01:20,167 --> 00:01:22,169
you will arrange a summitwith Bonanno.

32
00:01:22,212 --> 00:01:24,127
I saw Bumpy cut that
peckerwood into ribbons,

33
00:01:24,171 --> 00:01:26,477
and I enjoyed
every single minute.

34
00:01:26,521 --> 00:01:29,132
Bumpy Johnson
instigated this war.

35
00:01:29,176 --> 00:01:31,091
What are we gonna do about it?

36
00:02:35,807 --> 00:02:37,200
Bumpy Johnson.

37
00:02:37,244 --> 00:02:39,942
You are here
to answer a summons

38
00:02:39,985 --> 00:02:42,510
that you,in cold-blooded fashion,

39
00:02:42,553 --> 00:02:47,210
did murder a made manin the Genovese Family.

40
00:02:47,254 --> 00:02:49,169
I'm here to respond
to those charges.

41
00:02:49,212 --> 00:02:50,561
Sit down.

42
00:02:55,871 --> 00:02:58,961
Chin, why don't you start?

43
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:03,400
Bumpy Johnson came out of prisonless than a year ago.

44
00:03:03,444 --> 00:03:08,231
He had one thing on his mindthe desire to steal from us.

45
00:03:09,276 --> 00:03:11,408
To pit usagainst each other...

46
00:03:11,452 --> 00:03:14,324
to take territory that wasnever his in the first place!

47
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:22,202
And worst of all, he killedmy capo, Richie Zambrano.

48
00:03:22,245 --> 00:03:23,551
He is not the loyal soldier

49
00:03:23,594 --> 00:03:26,336
that spent 11 yearsprotecting Vito Genovese.

50
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:29,252
He's been inspiredby the nigger "uprising"

51
00:03:29,296 --> 00:03:31,254
that's poisoning
this country.

52
00:03:31,298 --> 00:03:36,390
And this nigger herehas forgotten his place!

53
00:03:37,304 --> 00:03:39,915
He's a cancer
to our families.

54
00:03:41,264 --> 00:03:43,440
And I move to cut
this cancer out!

55
00:03:44,702 --> 00:03:48,445
The war of '57, he ordered
the murder of my son

56
00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:51,318
from his prison cell.

57
00:03:51,361 --> 00:03:53,972
I think he killed
my capo Donnie Apreda

58
00:03:54,016 --> 00:03:55,452
just a couple of weeks ago.

59
00:03:55,496 --> 00:03:59,848
My Family wants the contract
for his death.

60
00:03:59,891 --> 00:04:02,372
It is my right.

61
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:06,376
Bonanno.
I don't kill kids.

62
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:09,640
You bought into
this line of bullshit

63
00:04:09,684 --> 00:04:13,644
from a guy who walks around
the street in a bathrobe?

64
00:04:13,688 --> 00:04:16,386
Come on.

65
00:04:17,822 --> 00:04:20,477
You killed Zambrano,

66
00:04:20,521 --> 00:04:23,263
and then you lied to me
about it.

67
00:04:23,306 --> 00:04:26,004
30 years, you lied to me!

68
00:04:26,048 --> 00:04:29,791
30 years of friendshipbetween us, and you betrayed me!

69
00:04:29,834 --> 00:04:32,228
Tell me you didn't lie!

70
00:04:33,447 --> 00:04:35,666
I admit it.

71
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:37,407
I killed Richie Zambrano.

72
00:04:38,843 --> 00:04:40,497
In self-defense!

73
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:44,588
Against the orders of the Familyto not touch me,

74
00:04:44,632 --> 00:04:47,591
he sent a hitter
to kill me with my family.

75
00:04:47,635 --> 00:04:49,463
So I killed him.

76
00:04:49,506 --> 00:04:51,987
Which is the same thing that anyone of you guys would've done.

77
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:54,642
You killed a made man!That's end of story!

78
00:04:54,685 --> 00:04:56,296
Can I finish with my say?

79
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:02,258
1963's been a tough year for me.

80
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,434
I think it's been
even worse for you guys.

81
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:08,003
A couple of weeks ago,
Adam Clayton Powell

82
00:05:08,046 --> 00:05:11,876
named many of you in
the Bowery Lane investigation.

83
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:18,100
Bowery Lane has kept our illegalprofits hidden for years.

84
00:05:18,143 --> 00:05:19,971
And over the last
number of years,

85
00:05:20,015 --> 00:05:25,455
I've been watching every single
transaction of Bowery Lane,

86
00:05:25,499 --> 00:05:28,066
the same kind of transactions

87
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:32,767
that sent Al Capone
to jail for life.

88
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:34,986
I am...

89
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:39,556
the mob's worst nightmare.

90
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,908
I'm a Negro
with a mind for numbers.

91
00:05:43,952 --> 00:05:49,914
And I got the records
in a safe deposit box...

92
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:52,743
which will stay there...

93
00:05:52,787 --> 00:05:56,356
unless you try to harm me,

94
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:59,620
you try to harm my family,

95
00:05:59,663 --> 00:06:02,405
you try to harm my men.

96
00:06:02,449 --> 00:06:05,495
Those Bowery Lane records
will go back

97
00:06:05,539 --> 00:06:11,414
to Adam Clayton Powell'sSubcommittee on Organized Crime.

98
00:06:12,676 --> 00:06:15,200
Are you telling methat you're gonna snitch?

99
00:06:15,244 --> 00:06:17,289
You?You're gonna snitch?

100
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:19,030
You see the news,

101
00:06:19,074 --> 00:06:22,860
see why the U.S. and Russia
don't blow each other sky-high.

102
00:06:22,904 --> 00:06:26,168
It's because they got nuclear
weapons pointed at each other,

103
00:06:26,211 --> 00:06:28,300
just like we do.

104
00:06:30,607 --> 00:06:34,481
Mutually assured destruction.

105
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:18,672
 So So let me get this straight.

106
00:08:18,715 --> 00:08:21,370
What you're saying isI inspired you

107
00:08:21,413 --> 00:08:23,590
to protect a manyou can't even stand?

108
00:08:23,633 --> 00:08:26,331
Me and Powell,
we're like oil and water.

109
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:28,377
Eh, see, I think you'rebeginning to attain

110
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:30,031
a politicalconsciousness, Bumpy.

111
00:08:30,074 --> 00:08:31,859
Good.
'Cause everyone knows

112
00:08:31,902 --> 00:08:34,557
that crime don't pay
as well as politics do.

113
00:08:34,601 --> 00:08:37,517
But don't you get it,brother?

114
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,388
When men of your stripeget political,

115
00:08:39,431 --> 00:08:40,737
that's when
everything changes.

116
00:08:40,781 --> 00:08:44,828
We'll have a million-man armyto fight oppression.

117
00:08:44,872 --> 00:08:47,135
Even more so when you
take over the nation.

118
00:08:47,178 --> 00:08:48,615
Your day is coming,
Minister.

119
00:08:48,658 --> 00:08:51,095
-Yeah.
-It's coming.

120
00:08:53,663 --> 00:08:56,666
Here is
a bulletin from CBS News.

121
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:59,016
In Dallas, Texas,
three shots were fired

122
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:02,672
at President Kennedy's
motorcade in downtown Dallas.

123
00:09:02,716 --> 00:09:04,848
The first reports say
that President Kennedy

124
00:09:04,892 --> 00:09:08,591
has been seriously wounded
by this shooting.

125
00:09:08,635 --> 00:09:10,724
This is Walter Cronkite
in our news room.

126
00:09:10,767 --> 00:09:12,639
There has been an attempt,
as perhaps you know now,

127
00:09:12,682 --> 00:09:14,684
on the life
of President Kennedy.

128
00:09:14,728 --> 00:09:16,338
He was wounded in an automobile

129
00:09:16,381 --> 00:09:19,167
driving from Dallas airport
into downtown Dallas

130
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:21,125
along with Governor Connally
of Texas.

131
00:09:21,169 --> 00:09:23,693
They've been taken
to Parkland Hospital there,

132
00:09:23,737 --> 00:09:26,348
where their condition
is as yet unknown.

133
00:09:26,391 --> 00:09:29,090
We have not been told
their condition at Dallas

134
00:09:29,133 --> 00:09:31,832
in the downtown hotel room.

135
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:34,617
This picture has just
been transmitted by wire.

136
00:09:34,661 --> 00:09:37,272
It is a picture taken
just moments

137
00:09:37,315 --> 00:09:38,752
split moment before the...

138
00:09:38,795 --> 00:09:40,275
Terrible.
Just terrible.

139
00:09:40,318 --> 00:09:41,885
...assassination attempt
is here.

140
00:09:41,929 --> 00:09:43,800
Let's see if we can get
a real close-up

141
00:09:43,844 --> 00:09:45,802
of that picture
that has just arrived.Good lord.

142
00:09:45,846 --> 00:09:47,369
What is the world coming to?

143
00:09:47,412 --> 00:09:49,632
You'll notice a smiling
Mrs. Kennedy and the President

144
00:09:49,676 --> 00:09:51,242
in the back seat of the car.

145
00:09:51,286 --> 00:09:52,635
Mrs. Connally...

146
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:55,812
and Governor Connally,
you cannot see behind.

147
00:09:55,856 --> 00:09:58,902
The assassin took dead aim.

148
00:09:58,946 --> 00:10:00,817
He got the President,
apparently,

149
00:10:00,861 --> 00:10:04,255
with the first shot in the head and then Governor Connally.

150
00:10:04,299 --> 00:10:08,259
From Dallas, Texas, the flash
apparently official

151
00:10:08,303 --> 00:10:10,131
President Kennedy died

152
00:10:10,174 --> 00:10:13,787
at 1:00 p.m.
Central Standard Time,

153
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:16,746
2:00 Eastern Standard Time,

154
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:20,532
some 38 minutes ago.

155
00:10:22,273 --> 00:10:25,755
We do not know, uh,
to where he has proceeded.

156
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:29,933
People are gonna remember
what they were doing

157
00:10:29,977 --> 00:10:33,850
when they first heard
President Kennedy was killed.

158
00:10:33,894 --> 00:10:36,331
He was the first president
to say that civil rights

159
00:10:36,374 --> 00:10:37,593
was a moral issue.

160
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,247
Yes, yes.

161
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:40,944
We've lost a good friend.

162
00:10:40,988 --> 00:10:43,599
President Kennedy at the
Dallas airport this morning,

163
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,688
uh, was cheerful and waving.

164
00:10:45,732 --> 00:10:48,430
It's been quite a...

165
00:10:48,473 --> 00:10:52,608
Ladies, we shall notbe defeated by this.

166
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:55,742
We shall overcome.

167
00:10:58,745 --> 00:11:00,921
I just can't believe it.

168
00:11:23,378 --> 00:11:26,468
Jack.

169
00:11:26,511 --> 00:11:28,688
Jack.

170
00:11:30,037 --> 00:11:33,605
Nice work,Mr. Lee Harvey Oswald.

171
00:11:33,649 --> 00:11:35,782
The son of a bitch is dead.

172
00:11:35,825 --> 00:11:38,654
...suspect in the assassination of President Kennedy.

173
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:41,701
Maybe now I can get a date
with Marilyn Monroe.

174
00:11:41,744 --> 00:11:43,224
Pbht! Dream on.

175
00:11:43,267 --> 00:11:44,878
Hold on.
I want to hear this.

176
00:11:44,921 --> 00:11:47,010
...pro-Castro
Fair Play for Cuba Committee.

177
00:11:47,054 --> 00:11:50,927
He went to Russia in 1959
saying he was relinquishing

178
00:11:50,971 --> 00:11:52,799
his United States citizenship.

179
00:11:52,842 --> 00:11:54,061
He returned last year,

180
00:11:54,104 --> 00:11:56,106
complaining that
he was disillusioned.

181
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:58,935
Holy shit. A fuckin' commie
did this!

182
00:11:58,979 --> 00:12:00,850
Oswald...Do me a favor, guys.

183
00:12:00,894 --> 00:12:02,591
Give us some
some privacy here.

184
00:12:02,634 --> 00:12:03,984
...where he will
be questioned.

185
00:12:04,027 --> 00:12:05,681
He is also a suspect
in the murder...

186
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,814
Eight ball?

187
00:12:07,857 --> 00:12:10,077
You gonna hit me with
that fuckin' cue again?

188
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,992
Hey. Come on.

189
00:12:12,035 --> 00:12:13,950
No hard feelings.
Huh?

190
00:12:13,994 --> 00:12:15,778
...not long after the shot
was fired on President...

191
00:12:15,822 --> 00:12:18,520
We can make a move
on Bumpy.

192
00:12:18,563 --> 00:12:23,003
How? He'll put us all
in the joint if we take a shot.

193
00:12:23,046 --> 00:12:27,224
Well, with Kennedy dead...

194
00:12:27,268 --> 00:12:31,794
you know, Bobby Kennedy'sgot no latitude to fuck us.

195
00:12:31,838 --> 00:12:35,450
Bumpy's leverage goes away whenthe investigation goes away.

196
00:12:37,626 --> 00:12:40,847
We would really have to be sure
before we make a move.

197
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:43,327
Oh, I know a way
we can stay clean.

198
00:12:43,371 --> 00:12:44,633
How's that?

199
00:12:44,676 --> 00:12:47,288
I got a guy inPalermo, Sicily, right?

200
00:12:47,331 --> 00:12:49,899
Somebody I bring inwhen I want to make sure

201
00:12:49,943 --> 00:12:52,162
nobody can connect me
to anything I do.

202
00:12:52,206 --> 00:12:54,991
You fly him in,
he does his work,

203
00:12:55,035 --> 00:12:58,038
he's on a plane
the next day.

204
00:12:58,081 --> 00:13:00,823
-A Zip?
-Yeah. He's a specialist.

205
00:13:00,867 --> 00:13:03,913
He's got
over 40 contracts.

206
00:13:04,871 --> 00:13:08,004
Best Zip there is.

207
00:13:11,921 --> 00:13:13,923
Salud.

208
00:13:22,062 --> 00:13:24,673
 In the news this Sunday,
Lee Harvey Oswald,

209
00:13:24,716 --> 00:13:27,589
who has been charged with  the murder of President Kennedy

210
00:13:27,632 --> 00:13:30,984
and a Dallas police officer,
will be transferred today

211
00:13:31,027 --> 00:13:32,594
from Dallas Police
headquarters...

212
00:13:32,637 --> 00:13:34,248
Daddy, why'd he do it?

213
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:36,859
Our cameras are waiting
at the police headquarters,

214
00:13:36,903 --> 00:13:38,252
where he will
soon be escorted...

215
00:13:38,295 --> 00:13:41,733
You'll understand this betterwhen you get older...

216
00:13:41,777 --> 00:13:46,173
but there's some really badpeople in this world.

217
00:13:46,216 --> 00:13:48,697
Like the guy who killedPresident Kennedy.

218
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:50,830
Or those peoplewho were shooting at me.

219
00:13:54,094 --> 00:13:56,052
So, I'm gonna send youdown south with your mama

220
00:13:56,096 --> 00:13:57,793
for a little while.

221
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,664
I'll come and get youjust as soon as this trouble

222
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:00,927
is over, all right?

223
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:02,929
I don't wanna go
down south.

224
00:14:02,972 --> 00:14:05,105
Margaret,
listen to your daddy.

225
00:14:05,148 --> 00:14:07,020
Go to your room,
get your things together.

226
00:14:07,063 --> 00:14:09,849
I'll be in to help
in a minute.

227
00:14:13,417 --> 00:14:15,028
What is going on?

228
00:14:15,071 --> 00:14:17,987
I stepped on
Joe Bonanno's toes

229
00:14:18,031 --> 00:14:19,946
when I protectedAdam Clayton Powell.

230
00:14:21,295 --> 00:14:23,906
And I kept Bonanno andthe guineas at bay with this

231
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:25,908
with this Bowery Lane
thing, but...

232
00:14:25,952 --> 00:14:27,649
You pulled
your trump card.

233
00:14:27,692 --> 00:14:30,434
If the Italians go down for
tax evasion, so will you.

234
00:14:30,478 --> 00:14:32,523
I had to.

235
00:14:32,567 --> 00:14:35,091
Bonanno's coming after me.He thinks I killed his kid.

236
00:14:35,135 --> 00:14:37,354
We're not safe in Harlemright now.

237
00:14:37,398 --> 00:14:40,096
I'm gonna get Chance andPettigrew to take you down

238
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:43,273
to my sister's in Spartanburg,all right?

239
00:14:45,101 --> 00:14:48,104
I can't believe
I'm leaving Harlem.

240
00:14:49,366 --> 00:14:52,804
You remember that poem thatLangston says about Harlem?

241
00:14:55,024 --> 00:14:57,548
"What happens to
a dream deferred?"

242
00:15:01,857 --> 00:15:04,991
"Does it dry up likea raisin in the sun?"

243
00:15:06,296 --> 00:15:08,385
I got a dream, babe.

244
00:15:08,429 --> 00:15:11,911
You, Margaret...

245
00:15:11,954 --> 00:15:13,564
Elise, me.

246
00:15:13,608 --> 00:15:17,264
We're gonna be
a real family.

247
00:15:18,439 --> 00:15:22,312
I may have to defer
right now, but...

248
00:15:22,356 --> 00:15:24,488
but I ain't letting it go.

249
00:15:24,532 --> 00:15:27,187
Mm.

250
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:29,537
Hey.

251
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:32,018
I got this.

252
00:15:32,061 --> 00:15:35,412
Just take me a little bitto work it out, all right?

253
00:15:35,456 --> 00:15:37,240
Okay.

254
00:15:37,284 --> 00:15:38,546
Okay.

255
00:15:48,599 --> 00:15:51,080
Earlier today,
the President's car

256
00:15:51,124 --> 00:15:52,864
took them from the hospital

257
00:15:52,908 --> 00:15:54,301
to Love Field,
where they boarded...

258
00:15:54,344 --> 00:15:57,739
 I'm so sick of
this news. So depressing.

259
00:15:57,782 --> 00:16:01,221
Think about poor Mrs. Kennedy,what she must be going through.

260
00:16:01,264 --> 00:16:03,963
I know. Reports are Mrs. Kennedy
is holding up...

261
00:16:04,006 --> 00:16:05,355
...as well as one can...

262
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:07,488
...in this difficult a time.

263
00:16:07,531 --> 00:16:09,011
I'll get it. Relax.

264
00:16:09,055 --> 00:16:10,970
She has been described
as stunned...

265
00:16:11,013 --> 00:16:13,973
I love you.

266
00:16:14,016 --> 00:16:16,018
President Kennedy's casket

267
00:16:16,062 --> 00:16:17,672
was accompanied
back to Washington

268
00:16:17,715 --> 00:16:20,196
by the First Lady
and President Johnson,

269
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,111
who waited to leave
for Washington

270
00:16:22,155 --> 00:16:24,635
until they were all able
to travel together.

271
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:28,117
Stella.
You have a visitor.

272
00:16:28,161 --> 00:16:31,120
Wasn't gonna let him in,
but he insisted.

273
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,996
Just remember,
this is your father's house.

274
00:16:38,345 --> 00:16:40,390
And he wouldn't
like this at all.

275
00:16:40,434 --> 00:16:42,175
...downtown Dallas.

276
00:16:42,218 --> 00:16:44,133
Teddy, what are you
doing here?

277
00:16:46,831 --> 00:16:49,617
I brought you these.

278
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:54,056
I told him you didn't feel good,but I guess he didn't hear me.

279
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,406
Teddy, this is
my stepmom, Olympia.

280
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:59,018
Olympia, this is Teddy.I know who he is.

281
00:17:02,238 --> 00:17:04,893
Could you put these
in a vase or something?

282
00:17:04,936 --> 00:17:06,155
Please?

283
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:07,896
Mrs. Kennedy is now
in Washington

284
00:17:07,939 --> 00:17:09,550
accompanying
the President's body,

285
00:17:09,593 --> 00:17:12,248
which will be placed in the
tomb beneath the White House

286
00:17:12,292 --> 00:17:14,207
and will then move
to the...

287
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,252
I'll give you
three minutes.

288
00:17:16,296 --> 00:17:20,169
Three. You say
what you gotta say.

289
00:17:40,668 --> 00:17:44,585
Life can be over
in a second,

290
00:17:44,628 --> 00:17:48,415
shattered by a bullet.

291
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:51,853
I've lived that fear.

292
00:17:51,896 --> 00:17:54,856
And I'm willing
to accept that reality

293
00:17:54,899 --> 00:17:58,599
if it means
I can be with you.

294
00:18:04,605 --> 00:18:06,781
Okay.

295
00:18:10,263 --> 00:18:12,526
Oh, Teddy.

296
00:18:21,404 --> 00:18:23,493
You got some nerve.

297
00:18:23,537 --> 00:18:25,147
The both of ya's.

298
00:18:25,191 --> 00:18:28,194
Your father would hitthe ceiling, Stella!

299
00:18:28,237 --> 00:18:31,632
You gotta go.
Come on. Let's go.

300
00:18:31,675 --> 00:18:34,113
Get out.
Come on. Let's go.

301
00:18:34,156 --> 00:18:36,941
Now!

302
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:43,209
 Thank you all for
joining me on this trying day.

303
00:18:43,252 --> 00:18:45,950
I've gathered the leadership
of Mosque Number Seven

304
00:18:45,994 --> 00:18:50,390
to say that, on account
of President Kennedy's death,

305
00:18:50,433 --> 00:18:54,568
I've canceled my appearance onthe Lester Wolff show on Friday.

306
00:18:54,611 --> 00:18:59,486
Malcolm, I'd like you
to take my place.

307
00:18:59,529 --> 00:19:01,052
Yes, sir.

308
00:19:01,096 --> 00:19:04,143
You are to make
no remarks at all

309
00:19:04,186 --> 00:19:06,362
concerning the assassination.

310
00:19:06,406 --> 00:19:10,758
With all due respect,Dear Holy Apostle,

311
00:19:10,801 --> 00:19:12,586
this is our opportunity.

312
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:16,372
How's this man's death
an "opportunity"?

313
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:18,374
Because the white man'shatred,

314
00:19:18,418 --> 00:19:21,160
so casually practiced againstdefenseless black people,

315
00:19:21,203 --> 00:19:23,118
has spread unchecked

316
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,207
and struck downits very own Chief of State.

317
00:19:25,251 --> 00:19:28,428
This may be the only momentwhere we are able to get

318
00:19:28,471 --> 00:19:31,474
the white man to realizethe error of his ways.

319
00:19:35,261 --> 00:19:39,526
If asked, you are to say,
"No comment."

320
00:19:39,569 --> 00:19:41,615
With all due respect,Dear Holy Apostle,

321
00:19:41,658 --> 00:19:43,443
today the white man
needs our voice

322
00:19:43,486 --> 00:19:45,401
even worsethan the so-called Negro.

323
00:19:45,445 --> 00:19:48,448
Are you even listening
to the Messenger, Brother?

324
00:19:48,491 --> 00:19:50,232
Captain Henry,did any white person

325
00:19:50,276 --> 00:19:52,365
mourn the death
of Medgar Evers

326
00:19:52,408 --> 00:19:55,194
when America's hateshot him in the back?

327
00:19:56,107 --> 00:19:58,675
Did any of them mourn
Patrice Lumumba

328
00:19:58,719 --> 00:20:02,201
when Kennedy's CIAplotted his assassination?

329
00:20:02,244 --> 00:20:04,246
And what exactly
do you hope to gain

330
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:06,379
other than more
self-promotion?

331
00:20:06,422 --> 00:20:10,687
In every appearanceon radio or television,

332
00:20:10,731 --> 00:20:12,167
I make it crystal clear

333
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,256
that I am the Dear HolyApostle's representative.

334
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,867
My briefcase is stockedwith his photograph.

335
00:20:16,911 --> 00:20:19,479
You think you're the only one
who works around here?

336
00:20:19,522 --> 00:20:20,741
You don't sell
no newspapers.

337
00:20:20,784 --> 00:20:22,873
You ain't out there
fishing for recruits!

338
00:20:22,917 --> 00:20:24,484
You got amnesia, Brother?

339
00:20:24,527 --> 00:20:27,922
As I recall, I fished your assout of a garbage can in '52.

340
00:20:27,965 --> 00:20:30,664
Malcolm, Henry. Silence.

341
00:20:35,016 --> 00:20:39,281
Sometimes a man is so dedicated
to a righteous cause

342
00:20:39,325 --> 00:20:42,676
that he begins to believe
he isthe cause.

343
00:20:46,549 --> 00:20:50,336
Mind your tongue
with Lester Wolff.

344
00:20:50,379 --> 00:20:52,468
Yes, sir.

345
00:20:57,386 --> 00:20:59,214
That smooth-talkin' Negro

346
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,216
tried to show me up
in front of the Messenger?

347
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,350
Restrain yourself.I'm gonna kill
that motherfucker.

348
00:21:04,393 --> 00:21:07,222
Malcolm is currently Dear HolyApostle's choice to replace him.

349
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,485
That doesn't meanhe can't change his mind.

350
00:21:09,529 --> 00:21:12,314
Do you know something?

351
00:21:12,358 --> 00:21:15,317
He asked Sister Eliseto spy on Malcolm.

352
00:21:15,361 --> 00:21:18,451
Does that sound like a man whois sure of his replacement?

353
00:21:18,494 --> 00:21:19,887
No.

354
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:22,106
Bide your time.

355
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:25,545
Action against Malcolmis always an option.

356
00:21:25,588 --> 00:21:28,243
Hmm.

357
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,289
So, who is this
Lee Harvey Oswald?

358
00:21:30,332 --> 00:21:32,378
I think he was hiredby the New Orleans Mob.

359
00:21:32,421 --> 00:21:33,988
That's a stretch.

360
00:21:34,031 --> 00:21:37,818
Let's just hope this fuckingpatsy keeps his mouth shut.

361
00:21:37,861 --> 00:21:39,472
-Patsy?
-Oswald.

362
00:21:39,515 --> 00:21:41,474
I'll bet you anythingBobby Kennedy

363
00:21:41,517 --> 00:21:44,825
had the goods on, uh,Marcello in New Orleans

364
00:21:44,868 --> 00:21:46,348
and Giancana in Chicago,

365
00:21:46,392 --> 00:21:48,394
and then those guyshad Kennedy whacked.

366
00:21:48,437 --> 00:21:51,484
You ask me, this is a clearcase of self-defense.

367
00:21:51,527 --> 00:21:54,008
How do you know
all this shit?

368
00:21:54,051 --> 00:21:57,316
After I got made, I did a littlepiece of work in Chicago.

369
00:21:59,535 --> 00:22:03,496
I ain't never
making my bones.

370
00:22:03,539 --> 00:22:06,325
Hey, don't worry.You're gonna get made someday.

371
00:22:06,368 --> 00:22:09,458
You just got to have,you know, like, initiative.

372
00:22:09,502 --> 00:22:13,636
When I got tapped, I was 26,even younger than Chin.

373
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:17,684
'Cause I knew what my bossneeded, and I delivered.

374
00:22:17,727 --> 00:22:19,468
No questions.

375
00:22:19,512 --> 00:22:22,515
"Initiative."

376
00:22:25,518 --> 00:22:28,651
Nobody understands the dangerof the "Cosa Nostra"

377
00:22:28,695 --> 00:22:30,305
as much as I do,

378
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:33,569
but to suggest that Kennedy waskilled by the mob is outrageous.

379
00:22:33,613 --> 00:22:36,529
If you think that they won't
touch a politician

380
00:22:36,572 --> 00:22:38,226
you're wrong.

381
00:22:38,269 --> 00:22:41,403
Kennedy had more powerfulenemies than the mob.

382
00:22:41,447 --> 00:22:44,537
Russia, for one.
Or Or Castro.

383
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:47,453
Castro ain't stupid enough
to whack a president.

384
00:22:47,496 --> 00:22:49,411
We'd wipe his country
off the face of the Earth.

385
00:22:49,455 --> 00:22:52,588
Well, hold on.
W-Why would the mob risk it?

386
00:22:52,632 --> 00:22:55,548
Come Okay.

387
00:22:55,591 --> 00:22:57,419
Kennedy's father, Joe,

388
00:22:57,463 --> 00:23:00,640
was a bootlegger with
connections to the mob.

389
00:23:00,683 --> 00:23:04,426
They say that the Chicago outfitswung the election

390
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:06,123
so that his son
would be elected.

391
00:23:06,167 --> 00:23:11,346
But the minute, the very minutethat Jack Kennedy gets sworn in,

392
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,435
he makes his brother
Attorney General,

393
00:23:13,479 --> 00:23:15,481
and Bobby goes after the mob.

394
00:23:15,524 --> 00:23:17,265
So, here's the thing.

395
00:23:17,308 --> 00:23:19,833
After that,
Giancana in Chicago

396
00:23:19,876 --> 00:23:23,402
and, uh, Marcello in
in in New Orleans,

397
00:23:23,445 --> 00:23:25,404
they all made threats
against Bobby.

398
00:23:25,447 --> 00:23:26,927
Well, if they hate Bobbyso much,

399
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:28,624
why kill the Presidentand not him?

400
00:23:28,668 --> 00:23:30,713
Because if they kill Bobby,
the President

401
00:23:30,757 --> 00:23:34,674
can use the Army and the Marinesto go after them.

402
00:23:34,717 --> 00:23:38,634
But with Jack Kennedy gone,
Bobby just loses his power.

403
00:23:38,678 --> 00:23:41,463
Where's your proof?

404
00:23:41,507 --> 00:23:43,160
Look, it's just
a theory right now,

405
00:23:43,204 --> 00:23:46,468
but you need to use all
your Congressional authority

406
00:23:46,512 --> 00:23:49,036
to continue to investigate
the mob, all right?

407
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:51,342
This is rich.

408
00:23:51,386 --> 00:23:55,085
You want me to use my officeto target your enemies?

409
00:23:55,129 --> 00:23:57,131
They're your
enemies, too.

410
00:23:57,174 --> 00:24:00,613
Who do you think
hired the lawyers for
Esther James to sue you?

411
00:24:01,701 --> 00:24:04,268
Has it ever occurred to you

412
00:24:04,312 --> 00:24:07,837
why I didn't lump you in withall those other guinea mobsters

413
00:24:07,881 --> 00:24:10,623
at the tenant rent
strike hearings?

414
00:24:11,928 --> 00:24:15,889
Because deep down, you know
that we're on the same side.

415
00:24:15,932 --> 00:24:20,589
Because your wifeappealed for my clemency...

416
00:24:20,633 --> 00:24:23,505
in exchange forpaying your back taxes.

417
00:24:23,549 --> 00:24:26,595
And out ofthe goodness of my heart,

418
00:24:26,639 --> 00:24:29,990
I took a measure of pity
on that poor woman.

419
00:24:30,033 --> 00:24:32,471
If I were you...

420
00:24:32,514 --> 00:24:34,995
I'd quit
while you're ahead.

421
00:24:50,837 --> 00:24:52,926
Ahh.

422
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:56,277
Ahh.

423
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,539
Huh?

424
00:24:57,583 --> 00:24:59,454
Empire State Building,yeah?

425
00:25:11,118 --> 00:25:12,336
No, no.

426
00:25:16,993 --> 00:25:19,866
Ah. Ah.

427
00:25:21,041 --> 00:25:23,347
Will there be
anything else?

428
00:25:23,391 --> 00:25:25,915
Oh, that's...

429
00:25:27,438 --> 00:25:29,571
Thank you.

430
00:26:10,133 --> 00:26:12,222
-Okay?
-Okay.

431
00:26:48,824 --> 00:26:52,088
Hey. Keep it quiet.
It's Mrs. Gigante.

432
00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:59,661
I need to talk to him.

433
00:27:00,923 --> 00:27:03,709
Sure, Mrs. G.Let me show you inside.

434
00:27:04,971 --> 00:27:06,842
I wasn't even gonna say
anything to you

435
00:27:06,886 --> 00:27:09,279
'cause I thought
you were gonna blow up.

436
00:27:09,323 --> 00:27:13,762
Boy, he's got some fuckin' nervecoming to the house, yeah?

437
00:27:13,806 --> 00:27:16,722
What are you
gonna do about it?

438
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:19,681
Nothin'.

439
00:27:19,725 --> 00:27:22,162
What do you mean,
nothin'?

440
00:27:22,205 --> 00:27:23,685
You heard what I said.Nothin'.

441
00:27:23,729 --> 00:27:26,601
I swore to her that I'd stayout of her life, you know?

442
00:27:30,561 --> 00:27:33,913
What's gotten into you,
Vincent?

443
00:27:33,956 --> 00:27:35,349
She nearly died.

444
00:27:35,392 --> 00:27:37,743
It was an image

445
00:27:37,786 --> 00:27:41,268
that I am not gonna forgetfor the rest of my life.

446
00:27:41,311 --> 00:27:44,140
I don't understand you.

447
00:27:44,184 --> 00:27:47,622
Look, I imagined the sameas you did, Olympia,

448
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,537
that she was gonna meetsome nice Italian boy,

449
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:51,234
you know, somebodymaybe even like Ernie,

450
00:27:51,278 --> 00:27:54,020
you know, settle down.

451
00:27:54,063 --> 00:27:56,631
But then I come to realizeI have to accept her

452
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:58,372
for who she is

453
00:27:58,415 --> 00:27:59,895
and that if she'sgonna ruin her life,

454
00:27:59,939 --> 00:28:02,855
that's what
she's gonna do.

455
00:28:02,898 --> 00:28:07,337
You think I want to?!No! I don't want to!

456
00:28:15,781 --> 00:28:19,175
If you really cared
about her, okay...

457
00:28:19,219 --> 00:28:25,225
I'm just saying if you
really cared about her...

458
00:28:25,268 --> 00:28:26,922
you would stop this.

459
00:28:26,966 --> 00:28:27,923
How?

460
00:28:27,967 --> 00:28:30,534
How? I don't know how.

461
00:28:31,753 --> 00:28:33,581
Get one of your boys
to teach him a lesson.

462
00:28:33,624 --> 00:28:36,758
What?

463
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:41,154
It's not funny.
You want to laugh.

464
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:43,983
Yeah.

465
00:28:44,026 --> 00:28:48,422
I almost lost her once.That ain't gonna happen again.

466
00:28:48,465 --> 00:28:49,815
I did an interview

467
00:28:49,858 --> 00:28:51,991
with Adam Clayton Powella few months back.

468
00:28:52,034 --> 00:28:54,776
Which I'm sure he regrets.

469
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:59,955
Esther James. She has beena thorn in his side.

470
00:29:01,957 --> 00:29:05,961
And in three...two...one.

471
00:29:06,005 --> 00:29:07,963
Good afternoon.
I'm Lester Wolff.

472
00:29:08,007 --> 00:29:10,270
And this is
"Wolff At Large."

473
00:29:10,313 --> 00:29:13,969
Today, my guest, in place ofthe Honorable Elijah Muhammad,

474
00:29:14,013 --> 00:29:16,667
is the national spokesmanfor the Nation of Islam,

475
00:29:16,711 --> 00:29:19,322
Minister Malcolm X.

476
00:29:19,366 --> 00:29:20,628
Good day, Mr. X.

477
00:29:20,671 --> 00:29:22,761
Good day, sir.

478
00:29:22,804 --> 00:29:24,763
The hardships for
the black man in America

479
00:29:24,806 --> 00:29:26,939
are hardships for
white America, as well.

480
00:29:26,982 --> 00:29:28,810
They just
don't know it yet.

481
00:29:28,854 --> 00:29:31,378
See, oppression is not
just a one-way street,

482
00:29:31,421 --> 00:29:32,858
and neither are its costs.

483
00:29:32,901 --> 00:29:36,775
You are referring to PresidentKennedy's assassination?

484
00:29:36,818 --> 00:29:40,039
Um, I have no comment
on that.

485
00:29:40,082 --> 00:29:42,824
You're a national spokesmanfor a religion

486
00:29:42,868 --> 00:29:46,785
that advocates violence,and you have no comment?

487
00:29:46,828 --> 00:29:48,482
Sir, I'd like
to make it clear

488
00:29:48,525 --> 00:29:52,051
the Honorable Elijah Muhammad
does not advocate violence.

489
00:29:52,094 --> 00:29:54,662
He advocates self-defense
against oppressors.

490
00:29:54,705 --> 00:29:56,925
And yet the Nation
stands accused

491
00:29:56,969 --> 00:29:59,275
of being all talk
and no action.

492
00:30:00,886 --> 00:30:06,805
Personally, I am committed to
action on behalf of our people.

493
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:09,024
Black Muslims have demanded

494
00:30:09,068 --> 00:30:12,158
a complete separationfrom white America.

495
00:30:12,201 --> 00:30:14,334
You want a separate nation?

496
00:30:14,377 --> 00:30:17,076
Hmm. Well, here in America,
the so-called Negro

497
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:19,600
already lives
in a separate nation

498
00:30:19,643 --> 00:30:22,037
with limited opportunity,
poverty,

499
00:30:22,081 --> 00:30:25,301
and a government created bythe white man for the white man.

500
00:30:25,345 --> 00:30:28,522
But you will admit the latePresident Kennedy was committed

501
00:30:28,565 --> 00:30:30,785
to advancing the cause
of Negro rights.

502
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:34,093
Again, no comment.

503
00:30:34,136 --> 00:30:37,270
Does his death
change anything?

504
00:30:37,313 --> 00:30:38,793
No comment.

505
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:41,100
But surely,like every American,

506
00:30:41,143 --> 00:30:46,583
you had a personal reactionto the news of Kennedy's death.

507
00:30:50,936 --> 00:30:53,852
Being an old
farm boy myself,

508
00:30:53,895 --> 00:30:58,857
chickens coming home to roost
never made me sad.

509
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:01,947
They always made me glad.

510
00:31:03,122 --> 00:31:05,211
What does that mean?

511
00:31:05,254 --> 00:31:10,042
Kennedy's assassination is just
a taste of the violence

512
00:31:10,085 --> 00:31:12,000
that America
has been inflicting

513
00:31:12,044 --> 00:31:14,220
in Africa, Cuba,
and Vietnam

514
00:31:14,263 --> 00:31:16,526
and, of course, right here
in its own backyard

515
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:21,183
as it relates to the black man
and his struggle for rights.

516
00:31:21,227 --> 00:31:22,968
In other words...

517
00:31:23,011 --> 00:31:27,015
In other words,
you reap what you sow.

518
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:33,369
In the news this
Sunday, Lee Harvey Oswald,

519
00:31:33,413 --> 00:31:36,633
who has been charged with  the murder of President Kennedy

520
00:31:36,677 --> 00:31:40,115
and a Dallas police officer,
will be transferred today...

521
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:43,118
Look at this littleshrimp-ass motherfucker.

522
00:31:43,162 --> 00:31:45,425
Changed world historywith just one bullet.

523
00:31:45,468 --> 00:31:48,080
Yeah, I'm just happy Kennedy
wasn't killed by a Negro.

524
00:31:48,123 --> 00:31:50,604
-God damn right.

525
00:31:50,647 --> 00:31:53,041
There is Lee Oswald.

526
00:31:55,043 --> 00:31:56,958
-Look at that!
-He's been shot!

527
00:31:57,002 --> 00:31:58,525
Oh, shit! Someone popped
that motherfucker.

528
00:31:58,568 --> 00:32:00,483
Lee Oswald has been shot!
There's a man with a gun.

529
00:32:00,527 --> 00:32:01,963
-What the fuck?
-Shit.

530
00:32:02,007 --> 00:32:03,922
Shot his ass
in the cop station.

531
00:32:03,965 --> 00:32:06,054
Absolute panic
here in the basement

532
00:32:06,098 --> 00:32:07,316
of Dallas Police headquarters.

533
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,101
Detectives have
their guns drawn.

534
00:32:09,144 --> 00:32:11,146
If they can kill
the man who shot Kennedy

535
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:15,498
in front of 50 cops,
then they can get anyone.

536
00:32:15,542 --> 00:32:17,152
Get to my house. Now.

537
00:32:17,196 --> 00:32:19,850
I want you to drive Mayme and
Margaret down to Spartanburg.

538
00:32:19,894 --> 00:32:21,069
I'm on it, Bump.

539
00:32:21,113 --> 00:32:22,070
Oswald has been shot...

540
00:32:22,114 --> 00:32:23,680
Send Pettigrew
and Junie, Bump.

541
00:32:23,724 --> 00:32:25,160
You need me here
to cover your back.

542
00:32:25,204 --> 00:32:26,945
I need you
watching my family.

543
00:32:26,988 --> 00:32:28,250
The armored car
has now been cleared,

544
00:32:28,294 --> 00:32:30,861
and they are loading him
into the ambulance.

545
00:32:30,905 --> 00:32:35,779
The ambulance is now leaving
Dallas Police headquarters.

546
00:32:40,045 --> 00:32:41,872
His name is Jack Ruby,

547
00:32:41,916 --> 00:32:43,613
and you're not
gonna believe this.

548
00:32:43,657 --> 00:32:47,400
I am inclined to believejust about anything these days.

549
00:32:47,443 --> 00:32:50,011
He owns a striptease club
in Dallas.

550
00:32:50,055 --> 00:32:52,187
According to
preliminary reports,

551
00:32:52,231 --> 00:32:54,537
he has ties to mobsters
in Chicago and New Orleans.

552
00:32:54,581 --> 00:32:57,976
Those are the cities thatBumpy Johnson mentioned.

553
00:32:58,019 --> 00:32:59,847
I'm not a big believer
in conspiracy theories,

554
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:02,067
but this certainly
confuses things.

555
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,160
Call a press conference.

556
00:33:08,203 --> 00:33:10,075
New York Times,
Amsterdam Gazette.

557
00:33:10,118 --> 00:33:12,251
Get everybody there.I don't care what the hour!

558
00:33:12,294 --> 00:33:14,383
Esther James is in court right
now trying to get you charged.

559
00:33:14,427 --> 00:33:16,168
You'll open yourself up
to questions about her.

560
00:33:16,211 --> 00:33:19,214
Roy. Haven't you learned anything

561
00:33:19,258 --> 00:33:22,217
being my associate
chief counsel?

562
00:33:22,261 --> 00:33:26,439
I am a master ofthe art of deflection.

563
00:33:26,482 --> 00:33:30,660
Adam, you have ignored
half a dozen subpoenas.

564
00:33:30,704 --> 00:33:32,227
Next will be
criminal contempt.

565
00:33:32,271 --> 00:33:34,795
Yeah, well, that
correctly sums up

566
00:33:34,838 --> 00:33:39,234
my feelings about thatcrazy bitch contempt.

567
00:33:44,761 --> 00:33:46,024
What are you gonna do?

568
00:33:46,067 --> 00:33:50,332
I am gonna makeBumpy Johnson's day.

569
00:33:56,077 --> 00:33:57,296
Can I sit?

570
00:34:03,693 --> 00:34:07,175
I know it isn't my business,but is Stella all right?

571
00:34:07,219 --> 00:34:10,004
She's fine.

572
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,093
And you're right it ain't
your fuckin' business.

573
00:34:13,138 --> 00:34:15,227
I'd like to know
what happened.

574
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:17,098
You got to get her
out of your head.

575
00:34:17,142 --> 00:34:19,405
I can't, and if you...

576
00:34:19,448 --> 00:34:22,234
If I made my bonesand you deemed me worthy,

577
00:34:22,277 --> 00:34:24,540
I would ask for her hand
in marriage.

578
00:34:24,584 --> 00:34:27,804
I'm serious.

579
00:34:27,848 --> 00:34:29,893
Is somethin'
fuckin' wrong with you?

580
00:34:29,937 --> 00:34:32,113
Is there somethin' wrong
with your head?

581
00:34:32,157 --> 00:34:33,636
I'm concerned about her.

582
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,508
And what do you need,
a fuckin' piano to drop on you?

583
00:34:35,551 --> 00:34:39,120
For fuck's sake, she doesn't
fuckin' love you!

584
00:34:39,164 --> 00:34:42,036
She's got to love you back!
You understand?!

585
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,256
She loves that
fuckin' black bastard,

586
00:34:44,299 --> 00:34:46,475
and I would kill that
son of a bitch if I could,

587
00:34:46,519 --> 00:34:48,782
but I told her that
I would leave it alone

588
00:34:48,825 --> 00:34:51,872
after she tried
to kill herself.

589
00:34:51,915 --> 00:34:53,787
Stella tried
to kill herself?

590
00:34:57,225 --> 00:35:01,316
That's how much that nigger
has crawled under her skin.

591
00:35:14,199 --> 00:35:15,200
-Hey.
-Hey.

592
00:35:15,243 --> 00:35:17,593
Hey. You know
we got to be quick.

593
00:35:17,637 --> 00:35:20,118
People here aren't used to
seeing Negroes on my block.

594
00:35:20,161 --> 00:35:21,423
I ain't afraid of shitlike that no more.

595
00:35:21,467 --> 00:35:24,774
I don't care what anybodyon this block says.

596
00:35:24,818 --> 00:35:26,907
I got it.

597
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:29,301
Got what?

598
00:35:29,344 --> 00:35:31,999
Sam Cooke's warm-up actgot sick or something,

599
00:35:32,042 --> 00:35:34,262
and the record labelgot me the gig.

600
00:35:35,655 --> 00:35:36,917
Stella...

601
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,180
I got the Apollo.

602
00:35:39,224 --> 00:35:41,139
The Apollo?

603
00:35:41,182 --> 00:35:44,490
The fuckin' Apollo.It's happening, Stell.

604
00:35:44,533 --> 00:35:45,969
It's all coming true!

605
00:35:46,013 --> 00:35:47,667
Oh, my God!
I know!

606
00:35:50,974 --> 00:35:53,194
Teddy,
I'm so happy for you.

607
00:35:53,238 --> 00:35:57,285
For us.
Be happy for us.

608
00:35:58,286 --> 00:36:01,289
Look, I'm gonna be onstageat 7:00 tonight,

609
00:36:01,333 --> 00:36:03,291
and I want youto be there with me.

610
00:36:03,335 --> 00:36:06,251
Of course.

611
00:36:06,294 --> 00:36:08,688
And bring a bag.

612
00:36:08,731 --> 00:36:10,559
Hmm?

613
00:36:10,603 --> 00:36:12,387
We're going to L.A.

614
00:36:14,955 --> 00:36:17,218
We're going to L.A.

615
00:36:17,262 --> 00:36:19,568
The label wants me torecord some stuff out there.

616
00:36:19,612 --> 00:36:22,267
They They're giving mea housing allowance.

617
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:25,008
-You're not serious.
-Yeah.

618
00:36:25,052 --> 00:36:27,010
Maybe we'll get a placenext to Sammy Davis Jr.

619
00:36:27,054 --> 00:36:28,882
I don't know.

620
00:36:28,925 --> 00:36:31,276
Oh, my God.

621
00:36:31,319 --> 00:36:32,364
Teddy.

622
00:36:32,407 --> 00:36:35,149
Goodbye, Harlem.
Hello, Hollywood.

623
00:36:39,501 --> 00:36:41,634
We're going to L.A.,Stell!

624
00:36:43,331 --> 00:36:44,550
Whoo!

625
00:36:44,593 --> 00:36:46,073
Teddy.

626
00:36:48,293 --> 00:36:51,513
Dear Holy Apostle,
you wanted to see me?

627
00:36:51,557 --> 00:36:55,169
Did you see
the late edition?

628
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:57,258
No, sir. I didn't.

629
00:37:03,917 --> 00:37:07,225
That wasa very bad statement.

630
00:37:07,268 --> 00:37:10,010
The country
loves this man.

631
00:37:11,054 --> 00:37:13,448
I apologize,
Dear Holy Apostle.

632
00:37:13,492 --> 00:37:17,583
A statement like that can makeit hard for Muslims in general.

633
00:37:17,626 --> 00:37:19,149
That wasn't my intention.

634
00:37:19,193 --> 00:37:20,716
What wasyour intention?

635
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:23,415
I'm frustrated.

636
00:37:23,458 --> 00:37:25,547
Frustrated with
the white man's inability

637
00:37:25,591 --> 00:37:30,639
to see that his hatred
is, in fact, a boomerang.

638
00:37:30,683 --> 00:37:33,903
I simply wanted
to make that point.

639
00:37:33,947 --> 00:37:36,297
You wanted to challengemy authority.

640
00:37:36,341 --> 00:37:38,821
No, sir. I would never
knowingly challenge you.

641
00:37:38,865 --> 00:37:41,259
But you did.

642
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:46,307
Perhaps you need some timeto reflect on it.

643
00:37:46,351 --> 00:37:49,310
I'll have to silence youfor the next 90 days

644
00:37:49,354 --> 00:37:51,094
so that Muslims everywhere

645
00:37:51,138 --> 00:37:54,533
can be disassociatedfrom the blunder.

646
00:37:58,014 --> 00:38:00,539
Yes, sir.

647
00:38:00,582 --> 00:38:04,194
I agree with you.

648
00:38:04,238 --> 00:38:08,373
And I submit, 100%.

649
00:38:08,416 --> 00:38:10,940
I'm sorry, son.

650
00:38:10,984 --> 00:38:13,856
But you brought thison yourself.

651
00:38:25,694 --> 00:38:28,349
Scusa.Uh...

652
00:38:28,393 --> 00:38:32,353
Empire State Building.

653
00:38:32,397 --> 00:38:34,877
Empire State Building.

654
00:39:06,474 --> 00:39:09,303
How long?

655
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:12,741
Till I get things
worked out.

656
00:39:12,785 --> 00:39:14,395
What if I said no?

657
00:39:15,527 --> 00:39:16,745
Well...

658
00:39:18,399 --> 00:39:21,402
I ain't gonna lie to you.
I'd send 'em anyway.

659
00:39:21,446 --> 00:39:26,233
Thank you for not lying.

660
00:39:27,669 --> 00:39:30,542
You've always known
the world I'm in.

661
00:39:30,585 --> 00:39:33,632
Maybe better than
anyone else close to me.

662
00:39:33,675 --> 00:39:35,634
The truth is...

663
00:39:35,677 --> 00:39:40,378
things are not safe for us
here in Harlem right now.

664
00:39:46,949 --> 00:39:50,431
What's wrong?

665
00:39:50,475 --> 00:39:53,608
When you say "us," you meanyou, Mayme, and Margaret.

666
00:39:53,652 --> 00:39:56,176
No, no, I didn't mean that.
I...

667
00:39:56,219 --> 00:39:58,570
I didn't know
that you could leave.

668
00:39:58,613 --> 00:40:02,443
You're working for Malcolm
and all that. I didn't

669
00:40:02,487 --> 00:40:05,446
Elise, please.

670
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:08,449
I love you, okay?

671
00:40:08,493 --> 00:40:12,627
I love you just as much
as I love them.

672
00:40:22,332 --> 00:40:24,422
I guessI gotta stay anyway.

673
00:40:24,465 --> 00:40:27,642
SinceMalcolm's been suspended.

674
00:40:27,686 --> 00:40:29,122
What's that?

675
00:40:29,165 --> 00:40:31,167
 The telephone's
been ringing off the hook.

676
00:40:31,211 --> 00:40:33,474
London, Paris,
Associated Press.

677
00:40:33,518 --> 00:40:38,087
I I informed them that
I disobeyed Mr. Muhammad.

678
00:40:38,131 --> 00:40:41,787
I'm so sorry.

679
00:40:42,657 --> 00:40:46,531
Elise,
I've been gagged.

680
00:40:46,574 --> 00:40:49,490
Which means that...

681
00:40:49,534 --> 00:40:53,233
Muslims are forbidden
to even look at me.

682
00:40:53,276 --> 00:40:55,670
In fact, for your
own protection,

683
00:40:55,714 --> 00:40:58,368
I should ask you
to leave this office.

684
00:40:58,412 --> 00:41:01,589
Please.

685
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:05,593
90 days isn't that long.

686
00:41:19,912 --> 00:41:22,218
Muslims are being given
the impression

687
00:41:22,262 --> 00:41:24,525
that I rebelled
against Elijah.

688
00:41:24,569 --> 00:41:27,310
Well, didn't you?

689
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:36,624
Brother, I'm like
someone who's...

690
00:41:36,668 --> 00:41:40,367
been in a beautiful, inseparablemarriage for 12 years,

691
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:43,196
and then, suddenly,

692
00:41:43,239 --> 00:41:46,721
my partner thrust me
with divorce papers.

693
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:51,509
The country's in shockover Kennedy's death.

694
00:41:51,552 --> 00:41:52,901
This will blow over.

695
00:41:55,208 --> 00:41:58,646
There's an officer here

696
00:41:58,690 --> 00:42:02,737
by the name
of Captain Henry...

697
00:42:02,781 --> 00:42:05,131
a man who I've known
for a very long time.

698
00:42:05,174 --> 00:42:09,352
I'm told
he was heard saying,

699
00:42:09,396 --> 00:42:14,619
"If you knew what Malcolm did,
you'd kill him yourself."

700
00:42:14,662 --> 00:42:16,621
Not on my watch.

701
00:42:16,664 --> 00:42:19,058
You don't get it,
brother.

702
00:42:19,101 --> 00:42:22,801
Any "death-talk" for me

703
00:42:22,844 --> 00:42:26,021
could be approved
by only one man.

704
00:42:30,504 --> 00:42:33,768
The man to whom
I've given everything.

705
00:42:37,946 --> 00:42:40,122
 If you'd killedthat nigger Teddy Greene

706
00:42:40,166 --> 00:42:44,126
like you were supposed to,none of this would've happened.

707
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:46,041
What are you
talkin' about?

708
00:42:46,085 --> 00:42:48,783
Look at him over there.

709
00:42:48,827 --> 00:42:52,265
I've never seen him
in a state like that.

710
00:42:52,308 --> 00:42:53,788
And I've known him
since I was 11.

711
00:42:53,832 --> 00:42:55,790
Man, you fucked up.

712
00:42:55,834 --> 00:42:59,098
He's in such pain
over this.

713
00:42:59,141 --> 00:43:01,361
If you'd have whacked him,you would have made your bones

714
00:43:01,404 --> 00:43:02,928
and you might've
even had the girl.

715
00:43:02,971 --> 00:43:07,454
I should go whack thatlittle jigaboo myself.

716
00:43:07,497 --> 00:43:10,675
Initiative.

717
00:43:12,677 --> 00:43:15,636
Gentlemen of the press,
thank you for coming.

718
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,899
We are all still reeling

719
00:43:17,943 --> 00:43:20,119
over the tragic death
of President Kennedy,

720
00:43:20,162 --> 00:43:23,601
and that is why I called you
here this evening.

721
00:43:23,644 --> 00:43:26,647
It has come to my attention
that Jack Ruby,

722
00:43:26,691 --> 00:43:28,649
the killer of Lee Harvey Oswald,

723
00:43:28,693 --> 00:43:32,261
could be involved
in one of the most chilling

724
00:43:32,305 --> 00:43:35,438
criminal conspiracies in
the history of this country.

725
00:43:35,482 --> 00:43:36,875
Excuse me, sir!

726
00:43:36,918 --> 00:43:40,400
Well, you ought to knowabout criminal conspiracies.

727
00:43:40,443 --> 00:43:42,794
Reverend Deadbeat!

728
00:43:42,837 --> 00:43:45,666
Ms. James, our financial disputeis being adjudicated in court.

729
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:48,321
He transferred
his money to his wife

730
00:43:48,364 --> 00:43:50,366
to get out of
paying me my judgment.

731
00:43:50,410 --> 00:43:51,716
Mr. Powell,
can you confirm this?

732
00:43:51,759 --> 00:43:54,414
Now the cops are here
to arrest him!

733
00:43:54,457 --> 00:43:56,111
-Mr. Powell!
-Mr. Powell!

734
00:43:57,809 --> 00:43:59,767
Come back here, you weasel!

735
00:44:01,856 --> 00:44:03,423
Okay, Bump.

736
00:44:05,686 --> 00:44:08,689
Hey, little one.
Look what I got you.

737
00:44:08,733 --> 00:44:10,560
It's an Astro Pop.

738
00:44:14,608 --> 00:44:16,566
Thank you.

739
00:44:18,786 --> 00:44:20,658
I need you to be strong
for your mom.

740
00:44:20,701 --> 00:44:22,181
You got that?

741
00:44:22,224 --> 00:44:26,576
You gotta understand no one
puts their child in a boat

742
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:28,883
unless the water
is safer than land.

743
00:44:28,927 --> 00:44:30,232
All right?Okay.

744
00:44:37,805 --> 00:44:40,982
What?

745
00:44:44,899 --> 00:44:46,814
I love you.

746
00:44:46,858 --> 00:44:48,860
I love you, too.

747
00:45:04,832 --> 00:45:07,705
-Keep 'em safe.
-You got it, Bump.

748
00:45:08,793 --> 00:45:10,795
I'll call you
from the road, huh?

749
00:45:10,838 --> 00:45:12,231
All right.

750
00:45:20,543 --> 00:45:21,893
You ready, Bumpy?

751
00:45:23,459 --> 00:45:25,374
Go home.

752
00:45:25,418 --> 00:45:27,202
What?

753
00:45:27,246 --> 00:45:29,552
I want to be alone.

754
00:45:29,596 --> 00:45:30,902
But, Bumpy.

755
00:45:30,945 --> 00:45:33,121
Go home.

756
00:45:57,885 --> 00:45:59,321
You're gonna be great.

757
00:45:59,365 --> 00:46:00,627
 I hope so.

758
00:46:00,670 --> 00:46:03,369
Teddy? Hey, man.

759
00:46:03,412 --> 00:46:05,240
I'm Sam Cooke.

760
00:46:05,284 --> 00:46:07,547
Listen. Thank you so much for
opening for me tonight, man.

761
00:46:07,590 --> 00:46:09,027
It's an honor, sir.

762
00:46:09,070 --> 00:46:11,986
Ah, man, I know you're
gonna knock 'em dead.

763
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:14,032
Thank you.

764
00:46:17,949 --> 00:46:19,777
Ladies and gentlemen,

765
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:22,344
please welcome Harlem's own

766
00:46:22,388 --> 00:46:26,305
Teddy Greene!

767
00:46:30,352 --> 00:46:32,485
Hello, Apollo.

768
00:46:32,528 --> 00:46:35,836
I can't tell you how long
I've dreamed of being here.

769
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:38,099
And I owe that to one person.

770
00:46:40,667 --> 00:46:44,018
One, two, three, four.

771
00:50:19,929 --> 00:50:23,237
 Hello?

772
00:50:23,281 --> 00:50:25,457
Daddy?

773
00:50:26,675 --> 00:50:29,243
Mayme?

774
00:50:32,116 --> 00:50:35,293
Ohh.
Officer, is isthere something wrong?

775
00:50:35,336 --> 00:50:36,772
Well...

776
00:51:21,687 --> 00:51:23,558
Breathe.

777
00:51:23,602 --> 00:51:25,734
Breathe.

778
00:51:40,445 --> 00:51:41,968
You...

779
00:51:42,011 --> 00:51:43,796
Are you okay?

780
00:51:46,015 --> 00:51:47,234
Are you...

781
00:52:22,530 --> 00:52:27,883
 I have to weara disguise, Patricia.

782
00:52:27,927 --> 00:52:32,366
Politically, I can'tget arrested in Harlem.

783
00:52:32,410 --> 00:52:37,023
So I have to slipout of town incognito.

784
00:52:37,066 --> 00:52:39,373
It's kind of
working maybe.

785
00:52:40,679 --> 00:52:43,377
Um, Adam.
Uh, we just got a message.

786
00:52:43,421 --> 00:52:47,251
Uh, the Justice Department is
going to drop "Cosa Nostra"

787
00:52:47,294 --> 00:52:48,513
as an investigative
priority.

788
00:52:48,556 --> 00:52:51,211
-What?! Why?!
-The Department's resources

789
00:52:51,255 --> 00:52:54,171
are gonna be focused on whether
the President's assassination

790
00:52:54,214 --> 00:52:56,303
was part of
a communist conspiracy.

791
00:52:56,347 --> 00:52:59,828
Oh, my. Comm
Oh, I knew it.

792
00:52:59,872 --> 00:53:02,396
I knew they Huh?

793
00:53:04,877 --> 00:53:06,226
There it is.

794
00:53:06,270 --> 00:53:08,402
-Is it better?
-It's much better.

795
00:53:08,446 --> 00:53:10,230
Oh, well, thank you.

796
00:53:14,582 --> 00:53:16,193
Hello?

797
00:53:16,236 --> 00:53:19,674
Your friend from Sicily
is going home in a box.

798
00:53:19,718 --> 00:53:24,244
You're next.
And that's me,above you.

799
00:53:47,485 --> 00:53:49,269
-Stella.
-What are you doing here?

800
00:53:49,313 --> 00:53:51,489
-Yeah, motherfucker.
-I'm just here to warn you.

801
00:53:51,532 --> 00:53:54,405
-It's not safe for you here.
-I ain't goin' nowhere.

802
00:53:55,884 --> 00:53:58,235
Teddy?

803
00:53:58,278 --> 00:54:00,367
Son of a bitch.

804
00:54:00,411 --> 00:54:03,283
Teddy? Teddy?!

805
00:54:03,327 --> 00:54:05,720
Oh, my God!

806
00:54:05,764 --> 00:54:08,549
Teddy!

807
00:54:18,516 --> 00:54:22,650
Get the fuck
away from me!

808
00:54:22,694 --> 00:54:24,478
Hey.

809
00:54:24,522 --> 00:54:25,784
Teddy, look at me!

810
00:54:25,827 --> 00:54:28,090
Hey, hey, hey, baby.

811
00:54:28,134 --> 00:54:31,442
Baby. It's okay.
Just keep breathing.

812
00:54:31,485 --> 00:54:32,878
Just...

813
00:54:32,921 --> 00:54:34,923
Teddy?

814
00:54:34,967 --> 00:54:37,143
Teddy? Please?

815
00:54:37,186 --> 00:54:39,928
Please.

816
00:54:39,972 --> 00:54:41,930
Teddy, open your eyes.

817
00:54:41,974 --> 00:54:45,325
Stella.
I'm sorry, Stella.

818
00:54:45,369 --> 00:54:48,850
Teddy!

819
00:54:48,894 --> 00:54:50,939
Teddy. Teddy.

820
00:54:50,983 --> 00:54:52,985
Hey. Hey, Teddy?

821
00:54:53,028 --> 00:54:54,334
Teddy.

822
00:54:56,554 --> 00:54:57,903
Stella.

823
00:54:57,946 --> 00:55:01,167
Get the fuck away from me,
you fucking murderer!

824
00:55:30,588 --> 00:55:34,113
Gentlemen, come to order.

825
00:55:34,156 --> 00:55:35,593
We are about to witness

826
00:55:35,636 --> 00:55:37,943
the end of the wiretaps
and the hearings...

827
00:55:37,986 --> 00:55:42,382
brought about by government
harassment of La Cosa Nostra.

828
00:55:42,426 --> 00:55:44,253
-Yeah, yeah.
-Yeah.

829
00:55:44,297 --> 00:55:46,560
Now, Frank, if I may?

830
00:55:48,997 --> 00:55:50,477
Now that we no longer

831
00:55:50,521 --> 00:55:53,698
face the threat
of the Bowery Lane Holdings,

832
00:55:53,741 --> 00:55:55,439
I would like
to ask the Commission

833
00:55:55,482 --> 00:56:00,357
for a five-family sanction
to kill Bumpy Johnson

834
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:02,271
for the murder
of Richie Zambrano.

835
00:56:02,315 --> 00:56:04,099
I second that.
All in favor?

836
00:56:04,143 --> 00:56:06,145
-Yeah.
-Luccheses are with you, too.

837
00:56:17,112 --> 00:56:19,637
Salud.

838
00:56:20,305 --> 00:57:20,394
