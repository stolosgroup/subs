2
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:21,897
Space - The Final Frontier.

3
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,653
These are the voyages
of the Starship Enterprise.

4
00:00:27,819 --> 00:00:31,907
Its continuing mission,
to explore strange new worlds,

5
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:36,912
to seek out new life
and new civilisations,

6
00:00:38,247 --> 00:00:41,500
to boldly go
where no one has gone before.

7
00:02:31,938 --> 00:02:36,026
Captain's log, stardate 41153.7.

8
00:02:36,192 --> 00:02:39,070
Our destination is planet Deneb IV,

9
00:02:39,237 --> 00:02:44,075
beyond which lies the great
unexplored mass of the galaxy.

10
00:02:44,659 --> 00:02:46,244
As you ordered, sir.

11
00:02:47,537 --> 00:02:49,914
My orders are to examine Farpoint,

12
00:02:50,081 --> 00:02:53,668
a starbase built there
by the inhabitants of that world.

13
00:02:53,835 --> 00:02:57,881
Meanwhile, I'm becoming better
acquainted with my new command,

14
00:02:58,048 --> 00:03:00,508
this Galaxy-class USS Enterprise.

15
00:03:04,054 --> 00:03:07,932
I am still somewhat in awe
of its size and complexity.

16
00:03:09,309 --> 00:03:12,729
As for my crew, we are short
in several key positions,

17
00:03:12,896 --> 00:03:14,814
most notably a first officer.

18
00:03:14,981 --> 00:03:19,319
But I'm informed that a highly experienced
man, one Cmdr William Riker,

19
00:03:19,486 --> 00:03:23,490
will be waiting to join the ship
at our Deneb IV destination.

20
00:03:23,656 --> 00:03:27,660
You will agree, Data, that
Starfleet's orders are - difficult.

21
00:03:27,827 --> 00:03:31,915
Difficult? Simply solve the mystery
of Farpoint Station.

22
00:03:32,082 --> 00:03:33,958
As simple as that.

23
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:38,171
Farpoint Station.
Even the name sounds mysterious.

24
00:03:38,338 --> 00:03:41,970
It's hardly simple, Data, to negotiate
a friendly agreement for Starfleet

25
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:44,621
to use the base,
while at the same time, snoop around,

26
00:03:44,622 --> 00:03:47,222
finding out how and why the life form
there have built it.

27
00:03:47,389 --> 00:03:51,476
Inquiry. The word... "snoop"?

28
00:03:51,643 --> 00:03:56,231
Data, how can you be programmed as a
virtual encyclopedia of human information

29
00:03:56,398 --> 00:03:59,567
without knowing
a simple word like "snoop"?

30
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,239
Possibility: A kind of human behavior
I was not designed to emulate.

31
00:04:05,907 --> 00:04:07,575
It means, uh... to...

32
00:04:09,327 --> 00:04:11,371
spy, to... sneak.

33
00:04:11,538 --> 00:04:15,625
Ah - to seek covertly,
to go stealthily, to slink, slither.

34
00:04:15,792 --> 00:04:19,796
(Exactly, yes) Glide, creep, pussyfoot,
gum- (Yes!) -shoe.

35
00:04:19,963 --> 00:04:22,173
Captain.

36
00:04:22,674 --> 00:04:24,676
I'm sensing a...

37
00:04:26,261 --> 00:04:28,430
...a powerful mind.

38
00:04:32,475 --> 00:04:35,020
Something strange
on the detector circuit.

39
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,283
It registers as solid, Captain.

40
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:53,038
Or an incredibly powerful force field.
But if we collide with it, it could be very -

41
00:04:53,204 --> 00:04:56,416
Shut off that damn noise!
Go to yellow alert.

42
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:07,010
Shields and deflectors up, sir.

43
00:05:22,901 --> 00:05:24,030
Reverse power, full stop.

44
00:05:24,531 --> 00:05:26,079
Controls to full stop, sir.

45
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:39,668
Now reading full stop, sir.

46
00:05:51,304 --> 00:05:53,515
Thou art notified that thy kind

47
00:05:53,682 --> 00:05:56,559
hath infiltrated the galaxy
too far already.

48
00:05:56,726 --> 00:06:00,313
Thou art directed to return to
thine own solar system immediately.

49
00:06:02,148 --> 00:06:04,150
That's quite a directive.

50
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:08,196
Would you mind identifying
what you are?

51
00:06:08,363 --> 00:06:10,740
We call ourselves the Q.

52
00:06:10,907 --> 00:06:15,036
Or thou mayst call me that.
It's all much the same thing.

53
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:22,877
I present myself to thee
as a fellow ship captain,

54
00:06:23,044 --> 00:06:25,422
that thou mayst better understand me.

55
00:06:25,588 --> 00:06:28,591
Go back whence thou camest.
Stay where thou art!

56
00:06:38,435 --> 00:06:41,604
- Data, call medics.
- He's frozen!

57
00:06:44,065 --> 00:06:48,278
He would not have injured you.
You recognize this? The Stun setting?

58
00:06:48,445 --> 00:06:52,991
Knowing humans as thou dost, Captain,
would thou be captured helpless by them?

59
00:06:54,284 --> 00:06:58,496
Now, go back
or thou shalt most certainly die.

60
00:07:11,508 --> 00:07:13,385
Captain's log, supplementary.

61
00:07:13,952 --> 00:07:16,339
The frozen form of Lt Torres
has been rushed to sickbay.

62
00:07:17,506 --> 00:07:21,051
The question now is
the incredible power of the Q being.

63
00:07:21,676 --> 00:07:23,678
Do we dare oppose it?

64
00:07:23,845 --> 00:07:28,809
Captain, thy little centuries
go by so rapidly.

65
00:07:28,975 --> 00:07:32,020
Perhaps thou will
better understand this.

66
00:07:36,983 --> 00:07:39,653
Actually, the issue at stake
is patriotism.

67
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:42,009
You must return to your world
and put an end to the commies.

68
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:44,199
All it takes are a few good men.

69
00:07:44,366 --> 00:07:48,203
What? That nonsense
is centuries behind us.

70
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:51,706
You can't deny that you're still
a dangerous, savage, child-race.

71
00:07:51,873 --> 00:07:54,167
Most certainly I deny it!

72
00:07:54,334 --> 00:07:58,672
I agree, we still were when humans wore...
costumes like that,

73
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:00,173
400 years ago.

74
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:02,926
Which time you slaughtered millions,
in silly arguments

75
00:08:03,093 --> 00:08:06,263
about how to divide the resources
of your little world.

76
00:08:06,429 --> 00:08:08,786
And 400 years before that,
you were murdering each other

77
00:08:08,787 --> 00:08:11,143
in quarrels over tribal god images.

78
00:08:11,309 --> 00:08:14,062
Since then, there are no indications
that humans will ever change.

79
00:08:14,229 --> 00:08:19,609
But even... when we wore costumes like that,
we'd already started to make rapid progress.

80
00:08:19,776 --> 00:08:22,529
Oh yeah? You want to review
your "rapid progress"?

81
00:08:28,243 --> 00:08:30,162
Rapid progress...

82
00:08:30,328 --> 00:08:34,541
where humans learn to control
their military with drugs.

83
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:38,587
Sir, sickbay reports
Lt Torres's condition is better.

84
00:08:38,753 --> 00:08:44,092
Oh! Concerned for one's fellow comrade.
How touching.

85
00:08:44,259 --> 00:08:47,721
And now a personal request, sir.
Permission to clean up the bridge.

86
00:08:47,888 --> 00:08:50,932
Lt Worf is right, sir. As Security Chief,
I can't just stand here and let -

87
00:08:51,099 --> 00:08:52,726
Yes, you can, Lt Yar.

88
00:08:56,563 --> 00:09:00,650
Ooh, better. And later,
on finally reaching deep space,

89
00:09:00,817 --> 00:09:03,904
humans of course found enemies
to fight out there, too.

90
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:08,658
And to broaden those struggles, you again
found allies for still more murdering.

91
00:09:09,284 --> 00:09:12,579
The same old story, all over again.

92
00:09:12,746 --> 00:09:16,708
No. The same old story
is the one we're meeting now.

93
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:21,379
Self-righteous life forms who are
eager - not to learn - but to prosecute,

94
00:09:21,546 --> 00:09:24,841
to judge anything they don't
understand or can't tolerate!

95
00:09:25,008 --> 00:09:27,844
What an interesting idea!
Prosecute and judge.

96
00:09:28,011 --> 00:09:31,848
I suppose it turns out we understand
you humans only too well.

97
00:09:32,015 --> 00:09:35,393
We've no fear what the true facts
about us will reveal.

98
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:38,396
Facts about you?
Splendid! Splendid, Captain!

99
00:09:38,397 --> 00:09:41,233
You're a veritable fountain
of good ideas.

100
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:43,610
There are preparations to make.

101
00:09:43,777 --> 00:09:48,031
But when we next meet, Captain,
we'll proceed exactly as you suggest.

102
00:09:53,912 --> 00:09:57,290
Sir, respectfully submit,
our only choice is to fight.

103
00:09:57,457 --> 00:09:58,738
Fight, or try to escape.

104
00:09:59,939 --> 00:10:01,419
Sense anything, Commander?

105
00:10:01,586 --> 00:10:05,799
Its mind is much too powerful.
Recommend we avoid contact.

106
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:12,848
From this point, no station aboard,
repeat: no station for any reason

107
00:10:13,014 --> 00:10:15,468
will make use of transmitted signals
or intercom.

108
00:10:17,269 --> 00:10:19,521
We'll try and take them by surprise.

109
00:10:19,688 --> 00:10:21,940
Let's see what this Galaxy-class
starship can do.

110
00:10:22,107 --> 00:10:25,694
Lieutenant, inform engine room
to prepare for maximum acceleration.

111
00:10:25,861 --> 00:10:27,821
- Aye, sir.
- Record search, Data.

112
00:10:27,988 --> 00:10:31,700
Results of detaching saucer
at high-warp velocity.

113
00:10:31,867 --> 00:10:34,077
Inadvisable at any warp speed, sir.

114
00:10:34,244 --> 00:10:35,954
Search theoretical.

115
00:10:37,664 --> 00:10:41,668
It is possible.
But absolutely no margin for error.

116
00:10:41,835 --> 00:10:46,590
Using print-out only, notify all decks
to prepare for maximum acceleration.

117
00:10:46,756 --> 00:10:49,088
Now hear this:
"Maximum", you're entitled to know,

118
00:10:49,089 --> 00:10:52,220
means that we'll be pushing our
engines well beyond safety limits.

119
00:10:52,387 --> 00:10:55,765
Our hope is to surprise
whatever that is out there.

120
00:10:55,932 --> 00:10:57,601
Try and outrun it.

121
00:10:57,767 --> 00:11:00,145
Our only other option...

122
00:11:01,271 --> 00:11:05,692
..is to tuck tail between our legs
and return to Earth as they demand.

123
00:11:26,922 --> 00:11:28,507
Engine room ready, sir.

124
00:11:28,673 --> 00:11:31,426
The board shows green. All go.

125
00:11:31,593 --> 00:11:33,303
Stand by.

126
00:11:34,221 --> 00:11:35,305
Engage.

127
00:12:06,002 --> 00:12:08,296
Velocity warp 9.2.

128
00:12:10,173 --> 00:12:14,010
- Heading 351, mark 11, sir.
- Steady on that.

129
00:12:14,177 --> 00:12:17,097
The hostile is now giving chase, sir.
Accelerating fast.

130
00:12:22,185 --> 00:12:26,189
We're now at warp 9.3, sir,
which takes us past the red line.

131
00:12:26,356 --> 00:12:28,150
Continue accelerating.

132
00:12:28,316 --> 00:12:33,071
Counselor, at this point I'm open
to guesses about what we just met.

133
00:12:33,238 --> 00:12:37,117
It felt like something beyond
what we consider a life form.

134
00:12:37,284 --> 00:12:38,702
Beyond?

135
00:12:38,869 --> 00:12:44,749
Very, very advanced, sir,
or certainly, very, very... different.

136
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:46,293
We're at 9.4, sir.

137
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:49,086
Hostile is now beginning
to overtake us, sir.

138
00:12:49,087 --> 00:12:49,713
Are you sure?

139
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:54,176
Hostile's velocity is already warp 9.6, sir.
Shall I put them on the main viewer?

140
00:12:54,342 --> 00:12:56,386
Reverse angle.

141
00:13:01,183 --> 00:13:02,976
Magnifying viewer image.

142
00:13:07,647 --> 00:13:09,733
Hostile's velocity is 9.7, sir.

143
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:12,569
Worf, inform the engine room
that we need more.

144
00:13:12,736 --> 00:13:14,863
Engine room attempting to comply, sir,
but they caution us -

145
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:18,617
Go to Yellow Alert. Arm aft photon torpedoes.
Place them on ready status.

146
00:13:18,784 --> 00:13:20,076
Torpedoes to ready, sir.

147
00:13:22,829 --> 00:13:24,956
Hostile now at warp 9.8, sir.

148
00:13:25,123 --> 00:13:27,918
Our velocity is only 9.5, sir.

149
00:13:28,084 --> 00:13:32,130
Projection, sir: We may be able
to match hostile's 9.8, sir.

150
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:35,717
But at extreme risk.

151
00:13:40,222 --> 00:13:42,682
Now reading the hostile at warp 9.9, sir.

152
00:13:42,849 --> 00:13:43,852
Now, hear this:

153
00:13:45,019 --> 00:13:47,519
Print-out message, urgent,
all stations and all decks:

154
00:13:49,689 --> 00:13:51,358
Prepare for emergency saucer separ(ation).

155
00:13:56,655 --> 00:13:59,407
You will command the saucer section,
Lieutenant.

156
00:14:01,868 --> 00:14:05,831
I am a Klingon, sir. For me, to seek
escape when my captain goes into battle -

157
00:14:05,997 --> 00:14:08,667
You are a Starfleet officer,
Lieutenant.

158
00:14:10,001 --> 00:14:11,461
Aye, sir.

159
00:14:11,628 --> 00:14:13,296
Make the mark, Data.

160
00:14:27,811 --> 00:14:30,605
Note in ship's log,
that at this startime

161
00:14:30,772 --> 00:14:34,151
I'm transferring command
to the battle bridge.

162
00:14:41,157 --> 00:14:45,369
Captain's log, stardate 41153.7.

163
00:14:45,536 --> 00:14:47,663
Preparing to detach saucer section,

164
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:50,583
so that families and the majority
of the ship's company

165
00:14:50,749 --> 00:14:53,669
can seek relative safety,
while the vessel's stardrive,

166
00:14:53,836 --> 00:14:56,297
containing the battle bridge
and the main armaments,

167
00:14:56,464 --> 00:15:00,676
will turn back and confront
the mystery that is threatening us.

168
00:15:12,563 --> 00:15:15,900
Lieutenant, your torpedoes must detonate
close enough to the hostile

169
00:15:16,066 --> 00:15:17,776
to blind it the moment we separate.

170
00:15:17,943 --> 00:15:19,236
Understood, sir.

171
00:15:19,403 --> 00:15:22,656
- All decks acknowledging, sir.
- Worf, this is the Captain.

172
00:15:22,823 --> 00:15:26,285
The moment of separation,
we will reverse power just enough

173
00:15:26,452 --> 00:15:28,621
to get your saucer section out ahead
and clear of us.

174
00:15:28,788 --> 00:15:29,747
Understood, sir.

175
00:15:30,998 --> 00:15:32,708
Torpedoes away, sir.

176
00:15:43,511 --> 00:15:47,014
Begin countdown... Mark.

177
00:15:47,681 --> 00:15:49,892
Starship separation... six,

178
00:15:50,601 --> 00:15:53,562
five, four, three,

179
00:15:54,146 --> 00:15:56,106
two, one.

180
00:16:41,068 --> 00:16:43,154
Separation is successful, sir.

181
00:17:20,774 --> 00:17:23,027
Torpedoes have detonated, sir.

182
00:17:23,194 --> 00:17:25,946
Let's come to a stop. Reverse power.

183
00:17:27,573 --> 00:17:30,242
Reverse power. Decelerating.

184
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,874
Dead stop.

185
00:17:46,967 --> 00:17:50,262
We'll hold this position...
and wait for them.

186
00:17:51,347 --> 00:17:54,183
That will bring them here
in just minutes, sir.

187
00:17:56,143 --> 00:17:58,478
Will we make a fight of it, Captain?
If we can at least damage their ship,

188
00:17:58,479 --> 00:18:00,014
- we have a chance...
- Lieutenant.

189
00:18:01,106 --> 00:18:05,736
Are you recommending that we fight
a life form that can do all those things?

190
00:18:09,532 --> 00:18:11,283
I'd like to hear your advice.

191
00:18:17,832 --> 00:18:19,333
I spoke before I thought, sir.

192
00:18:21,168 --> 00:18:24,755
We should look for some way to distract
them from going after the saucer.

193
00:18:24,922 --> 00:18:27,174
All forward motion stopped, sir.

194
00:18:27,341 --> 00:18:29,218
Thank you, Conn.

195
00:18:39,937 --> 00:18:44,483
Commander, signal the following in
all languages and on all frequencies:

196
00:18:45,568 --> 00:18:46,819
We surrender.

197
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:52,283
State that we are not asking
for any terms or conditions.

198
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:54,368
Aye, sir.

199
00:18:54,535 --> 00:18:57,288
All language forms and frequencies.

200
00:19:50,841 --> 00:19:52,760
The prisoners will all stand.

201
00:20:04,563 --> 00:20:07,066
Historically intriguing, Captain.

202
00:20:08,901 --> 00:20:10,903
Very, very accurate.

203
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:15,199
Mid-21st century.
The post-atomic horror.

204
00:20:18,911 --> 00:20:20,704
All present,

205
00:20:20,871 --> 00:20:26,210
stand and make respectful attention
to honored judge.

206
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:36,220
Careful, sir.
This is not an illusion or a dream.

207
00:20:36,387 --> 00:20:38,639
But these courts belong in the past.

208
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:43,060
I don't understand, either.
But this is real.

209
00:20:43,227 --> 00:20:44,979
Get to your feet, criminals!

210
00:21:13,924 --> 00:21:16,635
At least we're acquainted
with the judge, Captain.

211
00:21:49,335 --> 00:21:50,669
Attention!

212
00:21:51,879 --> 00:21:54,131
On your feet. Attention!

213
00:22:05,184 --> 00:22:07,645
You are out of order.

214
00:22:25,371 --> 00:22:27,790
The prisoners will not be harmed...

215
00:22:31,001 --> 00:22:33,295
...until they're found guilty.

216
00:22:35,589 --> 00:22:36,715
Dispose of that.

217
00:22:45,808 --> 00:22:48,602
Can we assume, you mean,
this will be a fair trial?

218
00:22:48,769 --> 00:22:51,438
Yes, absolutely equitable.

219
00:22:58,946 --> 00:23:03,868
Before this gracious court
now appear these prisoners

220
00:23:04,034 --> 00:23:08,581
to answer for the multiple and
grievous savageries of the species.

221
00:23:09,373 --> 00:23:12,042
How plead you, criminal?

222
00:23:12,543 --> 00:23:14,503
If I may, Captain?

223
00:23:16,464 --> 00:23:21,093
Objection, Your Honor. In the year 2036,
the New United Nations declared

224
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:23,679
that no Earth citizen
could be made to answer

225
00:23:23,846 --> 00:23:26,223
for the crimes of his race
or forbears.

226
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:30,769
Objection denied. This is a court
of the year 2079,

227
00:23:30,936 --> 00:23:33,189
by which time more "rapid progress"

228
00:23:33,355 --> 00:23:36,817
had caused all United Earth nonsense
to be abolished.

229
00:23:37,318 --> 00:23:39,320
- Tasha, no!
- I must!

230
00:23:39,487 --> 00:23:43,282
Because I grew up in a world
that allowed things like this "court".

231
00:23:43,449 --> 00:23:47,203
And it was people like these
that saved me from it.

232
00:23:47,369 --> 00:23:52,625
This so-called court should get down
on its knees to what Starfleet is.

233
00:23:53,375 --> 00:23:55,169
What it represents.

234
00:24:13,604 --> 00:24:15,856
You barbarian!

235
00:24:16,023 --> 00:24:18,734
- This woman...
- Criminals, keep silence!

236
00:24:18,901 --> 00:24:22,010
You've got a lot to learn about humans
if you think you can torture us

237
00:24:22,011 --> 00:24:24,573
or frighten us into silence!

238
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:26,492
Will she live?

239
00:24:26,659 --> 00:24:29,326
Uncertain.
When he froze Lt Torres on the bridge,

240
00:24:29,327 --> 00:24:31,247
we had a sickbay to help thaw him out.

241
00:24:31,413 --> 00:24:33,833
You will answer the charges,
criminal.

242
00:24:33,999 --> 00:24:35,835
For what? For this?

243
00:24:37,169 --> 00:24:40,005
Her death? Or worse?

244
00:24:40,172 --> 00:24:43,175
You promised the prisoners
will not be harmed.

245
00:24:43,342 --> 00:24:46,804
We plead nothing so long as
you break your own rules.

246
00:24:46,971 --> 00:24:50,349
I suggest you center
your attention on this trial, Captain.

247
00:24:50,516 --> 00:24:52,311
It may be your only hope.

248
00:24:52,477 --> 00:24:54,477
I suggest you are now having second thoughts about it.

249
00:24:54,478 --> 00:24:57,616
You are considering that
if you conduct a fair trial,

250
00:24:57,617 --> 00:24:59,650
which was your promise...
you may lose.

251
00:24:59,817 --> 00:25:00,776
Lose?

252
00:25:00,943 --> 00:25:03,487
Yes. Even though you're judge and prosecutor.

253
00:25:03,654 --> 00:25:04,905
And jury.

254
00:25:06,907 --> 00:25:10,202
Accepted.
So long as you keep to your agreement.

255
00:25:10,369 --> 00:25:13,372
Assaulting a prisoner is hardly
a fair trial!

256
00:25:13,539 --> 00:25:16,292
This is a merciful court.

257
00:25:43,694 --> 00:25:45,696
Silence!

258
00:25:47,823 --> 00:25:53,245
Continuing these proceedings, I must caution
you that legal trickery is not permitted.

259
00:25:53,412 --> 00:25:56,749
- This is a court of...
- ...court of fact.

260
00:25:56,916 --> 00:26:00,503
We humans know our past,
even when we're ashamed of it.

261
00:26:00,669 --> 00:26:04,173
I recognize this "court system"
as the one that agreed

262
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:08,010
with that line from Shakespeare:
"Kill all the lawyers".

263
00:26:08,177 --> 00:26:09,261
Which was done.

264
00:26:09,428 --> 00:26:12,848
Leading to the rule
"guilty until proven innocent".

265
00:26:13,015 --> 00:26:16,018
Of course. Bringing the innocent to trial
would be unfair.

266
00:26:16,185 --> 00:26:20,189
You will answer to the charge
of being a grievously savage race.

267
00:26:20,356 --> 00:26:23,025
"Grievously savage"
could mean anything.

268
00:26:23,192 --> 00:26:25,402
I will answer only specific charges.

269
00:26:25,569 --> 00:26:29,532
Are you certain you want a full
disclosure of human ugliness?

270
00:26:29,698 --> 00:26:31,700
So be it, fool.

271
00:26:32,785 --> 00:26:34,787
Present the charges.

272
00:26:34,954 --> 00:26:38,124
Criminal, you will read
the charges to the court.

273
00:26:52,805 --> 00:26:55,850
I see no charges against us,
Your Honor.

274
00:27:01,647 --> 00:27:03,649
You are out of order!

275
00:27:15,369 --> 00:27:17,830
Soldiers,
you will press those triggers,

276
00:27:17,997 --> 00:27:21,459
if this criminal answers
with any word other than "guilty".

277
00:27:39,008 --> 00:27:41,177
Criminal, how plead you?

278
00:27:45,223 --> 00:27:46,808
Guilty.

279
00:27:54,557 --> 00:27:56,267
Provisionally.

280
00:27:57,977 --> 00:28:00,146
The court will hear the provision.

281
00:28:01,898 --> 00:28:05,694
We question whether this court is abiding
by its own trial instructions.

282
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:08,363
How about your permission to have
Cmdr Data repeat the record?

283
00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:09,831
There'll be no legal trickery.

284
00:28:09,832 --> 00:28:11,825
These will be your own words,
Your Honor.

285
00:28:12,742 --> 00:28:14,828
What exactly followed
His Honor's statement

286
00:28:14,829 --> 00:28:16,496
that the prisoners will not be harmed?

287
00:28:16,663 --> 00:28:18,248
Yes, sir.

288
00:28:19,374 --> 00:28:21,584
The Captain had asked the question:

289
00:28:22,293 --> 00:28:26,131
"Can we assume, you mean,
this will be a fair trial?"

290
00:28:26,965 --> 00:28:29,634
And in reply the judge stated:

291
00:28:29,801 --> 00:28:32,971
"Yes, absolutely equitable."

292
00:28:33,138 --> 00:28:36,182
Irrelevant testimony,
entirely irrelevant.

293
00:28:38,768 --> 00:28:40,478
Alright!

294
00:28:42,105 --> 00:28:45,358
We agree, there is evidence
to support the court's contention

295
00:28:45,525 --> 00:28:47,527
that humans have been savage.

296
00:28:49,863 --> 00:28:55,410
Therefore, I say: test us. Test whether
this is presently true of humans.

297
00:28:55,577 --> 00:28:58,779
I see. I see!

298
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,958
And so you petition the court to
accept you and your comrades

299
00:29:02,125 --> 00:29:04,919
as proof of what humanity has become?

300
00:29:05,086 --> 00:29:09,382
There must be many ways we can be tested.
We have a long mission ahead of us.

301
00:29:09,549 --> 00:29:12,469
Another brilliant suggestion, Captain.

302
00:29:12,635 --> 00:29:15,555
But your test
hardly requires a long mission.

303
00:29:15,722 --> 00:29:19,142
Your immediate destination
offers far more challenge

304
00:29:19,309 --> 00:29:21,269
than you can possibly imagine.

305
00:29:22,228 --> 00:29:27,484
Yes. This Farpoint Station
will be an excellent test.

306
00:29:30,278 --> 00:29:32,947
All present, respectfully stand.

307
00:29:36,242 --> 00:29:40,538
This court is adjourned,
to allow the criminals to be tested.

308
00:29:42,415 --> 00:29:45,835
This honorable court is adjourned.

309
00:29:49,339 --> 00:29:50,882
Stand respectfully.

310
00:30:06,981 --> 00:30:10,610
Captain, you may find
that you're not nearly clever enough

311
00:30:10,777 --> 00:30:13,488
to deal with what lies ahead for you.

312
00:30:13,655 --> 00:30:17,534
It may have been better
to accept sentence here.

313
00:30:33,133 --> 00:30:35,885
What is present course, Conn.?

314
00:30:36,052 --> 00:30:40,515
What it's been all along, sir.
Direct heading to Farpoint Station.

315
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:43,977
Confirm. We are on that heading, sir.

316
00:30:44,144 --> 00:30:48,231
You know anything about Farpoint, sir?
Sounds like a fairly dull place.

317
00:30:49,315 --> 00:30:52,944
We've heard that
we may find it rather interesting.

318
00:31:02,037 --> 00:31:04,497
Personal log, Cmdr William Riker.

319
00:31:04,664 --> 00:31:07,709
Stardate 41153.7.

320
00:31:07,876 --> 00:31:11,296
The USS Hood has dropped me off
at Farpoint Station,

321
00:31:11,463 --> 00:31:14,466
where I await the arrival
of the new USS Enterprise,

322
00:31:14,632 --> 00:31:17,385
to which I've been assigned
as First Officer.

323
00:31:17,552 --> 00:31:21,139
Meanwhile, I've been asked to visit
the Farpoint Administrator's Office

324
00:31:21,306 --> 00:31:22,807
in the old city.

325
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:27,854
Aah, Cmdr Riker. I thought you want to know
we've still no word from your vessel.

326
00:31:28,021 --> 00:31:30,732
I trust we made
your waiting comfortable?

327
00:31:30,899 --> 00:31:34,027
- Luxurious is more like it.
- Good!

328
00:31:35,537 --> 00:31:36,337
Good.

329
00:31:36,738 --> 00:31:39,449
Would I seem ungrateful
if I ask for some information?

330
00:31:39,616 --> 00:31:40,867
Anything.

331
00:31:41,034 --> 00:31:45,497
Fascinating, the advanced materials used
in constructing this space station.

332
00:31:45,663 --> 00:31:48,041
Your energy surplus must be
as abundant as I've heard.

333
00:31:48,208 --> 00:31:51,378
Geothermal energy is one of the
great blessings of this planet.

334
00:31:51,544 --> 00:31:53,630
I'll have all the details of that
sent to your quarters.

335
00:31:53,797 --> 00:31:57,425
Thank you.
But it still seems incredible to me

336
00:31:57,592 --> 00:32:01,596
that you could have constructed
this station so rapidly and so...

337
00:32:01,763 --> 00:32:03,932
...so perfectly suited to our needs.

338
00:32:04,099 --> 00:32:07,852
Would you care for
an Earth delicacy, Commander?

339
00:32:08,019 --> 00:32:09,729
If there's an apple...

340
00:32:11,147 --> 00:32:12,565
I'm sorry, Commander.

341
00:32:12,732 --> 00:32:15,151
Oh, it doesn't matter.
What I was saying was...

342
00:32:16,403 --> 00:32:19,489
- I'll be damned.
- Ah! Yes.

343
00:32:19,656 --> 00:32:22,242
There was another selection here.

344
00:32:24,577 --> 00:32:28,081
Groppler, I could have sworn
this wasn't here a minute ago.

345
00:32:28,248 --> 00:32:31,418
And did your failure to notice it
make it unwelcome?

346
00:32:33,086 --> 00:32:34,045
Not at all, Groppler.

347
00:32:34,212 --> 00:32:37,590
I trust it will be the same
with Farpoint Station, Commander.

348
00:32:37,757 --> 00:32:40,427
A few easily answered questions
about it

349
00:32:40,552 --> 00:32:43,304
won't make Starfleet
appreciate it less.

350
00:32:44,222 --> 00:32:46,224
And it's delicious. Thank you.

351
00:32:47,142 --> 00:32:49,102
- Good morning, Groppler Zorn.
- Good morning.

352
00:32:57,652 --> 00:33:00,655
You have been told NOT to do that.

353
00:33:00,822 --> 00:33:02,907
Why can't you understand?

354
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,827
It will arouse their suspicion.

355
00:33:06,327 --> 00:33:10,415
And if that happens,
we will have to punish you.

356
00:33:10,582 --> 00:33:12,709
We will! I promise you!

357
00:33:21,426 --> 00:33:23,345
Dr Crusher!

358
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:30,435
Mother... It's Cmdr Riker.

359
00:33:30,602 --> 00:33:33,688
- Hello, Wes. Enjoying Farpoint Station?
- Yes, sir.

360
00:33:33,855 --> 00:33:36,026
I saw you and thought,
I might join you for a stroll.

361
00:33:36,027 --> 00:33:38,027
Actually, we were about
to do some shopping.

362
00:33:38,193 --> 00:33:42,113
- I've been meaning to visit the mall myself.
- Of course.

363
00:33:44,074 --> 00:33:47,827
If you're wondering about Mom,
Cmdr Riker... she's not unfriendly.

364
00:33:48,794 --> 00:33:50,580
She's just shy around men
she doesn't know.

365
00:33:50,647 --> 00:33:53,792
Wesley! I believe, that means,
he would like us to be friends.

366
00:33:53,858 --> 00:33:54,913
Oh, I'm willing, Doctor.

367
00:33:57,014 --> 00:33:58,814
Although we're not
officially part of the Enterprise,

368
00:33:58,815 --> 00:34:01,416
I thought, there might be something useful
we can do while we wait.

369
00:34:01,983 --> 00:34:03,401
Useful? How, Commander?

370
00:34:03,568 --> 00:34:06,130
Investigating some things that I've noticed
since I've been here.

371
00:34:06,197 --> 00:34:09,073
- The last was a piece of...
- Gold would be lovely with this.

372
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:11,568
- I had asked for...
- I am sure, Commander, there are reasons

373
00:34:11,569 --> 00:34:15,663
for a first officer to want to demonstrate
his energy and alertness to a new captain.

374
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:20,043
But since my duty and interests
are outside the command structure...

375
00:34:24,047 --> 00:34:28,092
Doesn't he remarkably happen to have
exactly what you asked for?

376
00:34:29,636 --> 00:34:33,264
Thank you...
I'll take the entire bolt.

377
00:34:33,431 --> 00:34:38,311
Send it to our starship when it arrives.
Charge to Dr Crusher.

378
00:34:46,152 --> 00:34:47,695
Let's see, where were we?

379
00:34:47,862 --> 00:34:50,862
I was accusing you of inventing work
in order to curry favor

380
00:34:50,863 --> 00:34:52,509
with our new Captain.
I apologize.

381
00:34:53,076 --> 00:34:56,037
Mom, that gold pattern wasn't there.

382
00:34:56,204 --> 00:34:58,748
Maybe this is something
Jean-Luc would like to look into.

383
00:34:58,915 --> 00:35:02,085
Jean-Luc Picard?
You know the Captain?

384
00:35:04,462 --> 00:35:08,883
When I was little, he brought
my father's body home to us.

385
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:10,969
Yes, Wes, long long ago.

386
00:35:12,387 --> 00:35:15,140
A pleasure to meet you, Commander.
Will excuse us.

387
00:35:15,306 --> 00:35:16,599
My pleasure, Doctor.

388
00:35:16,766 --> 00:35:18,017
- Wes.
- Sir?

389
00:35:18,184 --> 00:35:19,727
See you on board.

390
00:35:19,894 --> 00:35:21,688
Yes, sir.

391
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:24,607
Sir, the Enterprise is arriving...

392
00:35:24,774 --> 00:35:26,609
Is this an official report, Lieutenant?

393
00:35:26,776 --> 00:35:29,278
Sorry. Commander.
Sir, Lt La Forge reporting,

394
00:35:29,279 --> 00:35:32,657
the Enterprise arriving,
but without the saucer section, sir.

395
00:35:32,824 --> 00:35:35,410
- Stardrive section only? What happened?
- I don't know, sir.

396
00:35:35,577 --> 00:35:37,537
Capt Picard has signaled for you
to beam up immediately.

397
00:35:37,704 --> 00:35:40,915
Our new Captain doesn't waste time.
It's a good idea.

398
00:35:41,583 --> 00:35:44,002
- Thank you, Lieutenant.
- Aye, sir.

399
00:35:46,379 --> 00:35:49,966
Enterprise, this is Cmdr Riker
at Farpoint Station.

400
00:35:50,133 --> 00:35:51,926
Standing by to beam up.

401
00:36:22,131 --> 00:36:23,833
Lt Yar of Security, sir.

402
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,753
Capt Picard will see you
on the battle bridge.

403
00:36:31,965 --> 00:36:34,379
With the saucer gone, can I assume
there has something interesting happened

404
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,169
on the way here?

405
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:38,831
Battle bridge.
That's for the Captain to explain, sir.

406
00:36:40,391 --> 00:36:41,684
Do we have clearance?

407
00:36:41,851 --> 00:36:45,522
- Aye, sir, standard parking orbit.
- Make it so.

408
00:36:46,648 --> 00:36:48,441
Cmdr Riker, sir.

409
00:36:50,652 --> 00:36:53,363
Riker, WT, reporting as ordered, sir.

410
00:36:53,530 --> 00:36:56,574
- Is the viewer ready?
- All set up, sir.

411
00:36:56,741 --> 00:37:00,001
We'll first bring you up to date
on our... little adventure we had

412
00:37:00,002 --> 00:37:01,254
on our way here, Commander.

413
00:37:01,855 --> 00:37:02,855
Then we'll talk.

414
00:37:08,545 --> 00:37:09,921
Welcome aboard.

415
00:37:13,215 --> 00:37:14,300
This way, sir.

416
00:37:26,104 --> 00:37:29,607
Thou art directed to return
to thine own solar system immediately.

417
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:35,613
Go back,
or thou shalt most certainly die.

418
00:37:36,948 --> 00:37:40,326
You can't deny you're still
a dangerous, savage, child-race.

419
00:37:40,493 --> 00:37:45,331
Message from the saucer module, sir.
It will arrive here in 51 minutes.

420
00:37:45,498 --> 00:37:48,334
Inform them we'll connect
as soon as they arrive.

421
00:37:48,501 --> 00:37:51,171
And send the Commander to me
when he's finished. (Yes, sir.)

422
00:37:52,213 --> 00:37:55,751
And 400 years before that,
you were murdering each other

423
00:37:55,752 --> 00:37:57,800
in quarrels over tribal god images.

424
00:37:58,535 --> 00:38:00,955
Since then, there are no indications
that humans will ever change.

425
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:02,724
There are preparations to make.

426
00:38:02,891 --> 00:38:07,437
But when we next meet, Captain,
we'll proceed exactly as you suggest.

427
00:38:20,925 --> 00:38:23,469
He calls that a little adventure.

428
00:38:24,595 --> 00:38:25,846
Come.

429
00:38:35,981 --> 00:38:38,984
Not exactly a
run-of-the-mill happening, Captain.

430
00:38:40,194 --> 00:38:44,198
It seems we're alive only because
we have been placed on probation.

431
00:38:44,365 --> 00:38:46,534
A very serious kind of probation.

432
00:38:47,618 --> 00:38:48,703
Go.

433
00:38:48,869 --> 00:38:51,914
The saucer module
now entering orbit with us, sir.

434
00:38:52,081 --> 00:38:53,666
Acknowledge.

435
00:38:55,626 --> 00:38:59,630
Cmdr Riker will conduct
a manual docking. Picard out.

436
00:38:59,797 --> 00:39:01,006
Sir?

437
00:39:01,173 --> 00:39:03,384
You reported in, haven't you?
You are qualified?

438
00:39:03,551 --> 00:39:06,721
- Yes, sir.
- Then I mean now, Commander.

439
00:39:19,734 --> 00:39:22,611
They say you will be doing this...
manually, sir.

440
00:39:22,778 --> 00:39:26,532
- No automation.
- As ordered.

441
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:53,434
Velocity to
one half-meter per second.

442
00:40:00,816 --> 00:40:04,111
Adjust pitch angle.
Negative, three degrees.

443
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:18,042
Watch your roll angle, Conn.

444
00:40:35,768 --> 00:40:38,479
All stations,
prepare for reconnection.

445
00:40:54,203 --> 00:40:57,581
Thrusters to station keeping.
All velocities zero.

446
00:40:57,748 --> 00:40:59,458
Her inertia should do the job now.

447
00:41:03,796 --> 00:41:06,173
Lock up. Now.

448
00:41:51,343 --> 00:41:54,597
A fairly routine maneuver but...
you handled it quite well.

449
00:41:55,181 --> 00:41:58,809
Thank you, sir.
I hope I showed some promise.

450
00:42:00,102 --> 00:42:01,979
I do have some questions
for you, however.

451
00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:04,315
Yes, sir. I thought you might.

452
00:42:05,524 --> 00:42:09,612
I see in your file that Capt DeSoto
thinks very highly of you.

453
00:42:09,779 --> 00:42:14,325
One curious thing, however: you refused
to let him beam down to Altair III.

454
00:42:15,201 --> 00:42:19,330
In my opinion, sir, Altair III was
too dangerous to risk exposing the Captain.

455
00:42:20,331 --> 00:42:24,126
I see. A captain's rank
means nothing to you.

456
00:42:24,293 --> 00:42:29,632
Rather the reverse, sir. But a captain's
life means a great deal more to me.

457
00:42:32,009 --> 00:42:36,013
Isn't it just possible that you
don't get to be a Starfleet captain

458
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:39,475
without knowing whether
it's safe to beam down or not?

459
00:42:39,642 --> 00:42:42,144
Isn't it a little presumptuous
of a first officer

460
00:42:42,311 --> 00:42:45,106
to second-guess
his captain's judgement?

461
00:42:46,816 --> 00:42:49,568
Permission to speak candidly, sir?

462
00:42:49,735 --> 00:42:51,320
Always.

463
00:42:53,572 --> 00:42:55,908
Having been a first officer yourself,

464
00:42:56,075 --> 00:42:58,386
you know that assuming
that responsibility

465
00:42:58,387 --> 00:43:01,330
must by definition include
the safety of the captain.

466
00:43:01,497 --> 00:43:04,375
I have no problem with following
any rules you lay down,

467
00:43:04,542 --> 00:43:06,627
short of compromising your safety.

468
00:43:06,794 --> 00:43:09,338
And you don't intend to back off
from that position?

469
00:43:10,381 --> 00:43:11,340
No, sir.

470
00:43:14,343 --> 00:43:15,928
One further thing.

471
00:43:17,471 --> 00:43:20,015
- A special favor.
- Anything, sir.

472
00:43:20,182 --> 00:43:23,227
Using the same strength you showed
with Capt DeSoto, I would appreciate

473
00:43:23,394 --> 00:43:27,022
if you would keep me from making
an ass of myself with children.

474
00:43:27,898 --> 00:43:30,317
- Sir?
- I'm not a family man. Riker,

475
00:43:30,484 --> 00:43:34,196
and yet, Starfleet has given me
a ship with children aboard.

476
00:43:34,363 --> 00:43:37,199
- Yes, sir.
- And l...

477
00:43:37,366 --> 00:43:40,453
I don't feel comfortable with children.

478
00:43:41,454 --> 00:43:44,707
But since a captain needs
an image of geniality...

479
00:43:45,583 --> 00:43:48,085
...you're to see
that's what I project.

480
00:43:49,045 --> 00:43:50,087
Aye, sir.

481
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:55,051
Welcome to the Enterprise,
Cmdr Riker.

482
00:44:01,057 --> 00:44:04,310
Naturally, I've heard of your case.
The visor implant you wear is...

483
00:44:04,477 --> 00:44:07,646
Is a remarkable piece of
bio-electronic engineering

484
00:44:07,813 --> 00:44:10,566
by which, I quote,
"could see much of the EM spectrum

485
00:44:10,733 --> 00:44:14,320
ranging from simple heat and infrared
through radio waves," et cetera, et cetera,

486
00:44:14,487 --> 00:44:18,824
and forgive me if I say, I've listened
to this a thousand times before.

487
00:44:18,991 --> 00:44:22,912
- You've been blind all your life?
- Hm, hm. I was born this way.

488
00:44:23,079 --> 00:44:25,331
And you felt pain all the years
you've used using this?

489
00:44:25,915 --> 00:44:30,002
They say it's because I use
my natural sensors in different ways.

490
00:44:32,963 --> 00:44:34,298
Well, I see two choices.

491
00:44:34,465 --> 00:44:36,425
The first is painkillers.

492
00:44:36,592 --> 00:44:39,553
- Which would affect how this works.
- Hm, hm.

493
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:41,847
No. And choice number two?

494
00:44:42,014 --> 00:44:46,227
Exploratory surgery.
Desensitize the brain areas troubling you.

495
00:44:46,394 --> 00:44:48,312
Same difference.

496
00:44:49,021 --> 00:44:50,815
No, thank you, Doctor.

497
00:44:52,566 --> 00:44:54,360
I understand.

498
00:44:55,277 --> 00:44:56,612
See you.

499
00:45:14,255 --> 00:45:16,674
- Yes, sir?
- Where will I find Cmdr Data?

500
00:45:16,841 --> 00:45:19,176
Cmdr Data is on special assignment, sir.

501
00:45:19,343 --> 00:45:22,638
He's using our shuttle craft to transfer
an admiral over to the Hood.

502
00:45:22,805 --> 00:45:23,457
An admiral?

503
00:45:23,458 --> 00:45:26,517
He's been aboard all day, sir,
checking over medical layout.

504
00:45:26,684 --> 00:45:28,936
Why a shuttle craft?
Why wouldn't he just beam over?

505
00:45:29,103 --> 00:45:33,566
I suppose he could, sir, but the Admiral's
a rather... remarkable man.

506
00:45:33,733 --> 00:45:38,362
Have you got some reason you want my
atoms scattered all over space, boy?

507
00:45:38,529 --> 00:45:40,357
No, sir. But at your age, sir,
I thought,

508
00:45:40,358 --> 00:45:43,367
you shouldn't put up with the time
and trouble of a shuttle craft.

509
00:45:43,534 --> 00:45:46,078
- Hold it right there, boy.
- Sir?

510
00:45:46,245 --> 00:45:48,164
What about my age?

511
00:45:48,330 --> 00:45:52,168
- Sorry, sir. If that subject troubles you...
- Troubles me?

512
00:45:52,334 --> 00:45:56,255
What's so damn troublesome
about not having died?

513
00:45:56,422 --> 00:45:58,299
How old do you think I am anyway?

514
00:45:58,466 --> 00:46:01,844
137 years, Admiral,
according to Starfleet records.

515
00:46:03,971 --> 00:46:07,433
Explain how
you remember that so exactly.

516
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:10,019
I remember every fact
I'm exposed to, sir.

517
00:46:14,523 --> 00:46:20,071
I don't see no points on your ears, boy,
but you sound like a Vulcan.

518
00:46:20,237 --> 00:46:22,990
No, sir. I'm an android.

519
00:46:24,143 --> 00:46:25,243
Hm...

520
00:46:27,244 --> 00:46:29,038
Almost as bad.

521
00:46:30,664 --> 00:46:32,541
I thought it was generally accepted, sir,

522
00:46:32,708 --> 00:46:36,128
that Vulcans are an advanced
and most honorable race.

523
00:46:36,295 --> 00:46:38,339
They are, they are...

524
00:46:38,506 --> 00:46:40,633
And damn annoying at times.

525
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,301
Yes, sir.

526
00:46:42,468 --> 00:46:46,555
Well, this is a new ship,
but she's got the right name.

527
00:46:47,348 --> 00:46:50,518
- Now you remember that, you hear?
- I will, sir.

528
00:46:50,684 --> 00:46:52,812
You treat her like a lady.

529
00:46:54,355 --> 00:46:56,565
And she'll always bring you home.

530
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:26,929
Did you signal the Hood,
Cmdr Riker?

531
00:47:27,096 --> 00:47:30,266
Your exact message:
"Bon voyage, mon ami".

532
00:47:30,433 --> 00:47:32,017
Ha-haa. What was the reply, computer?

533
00:47:32,184 --> 00:47:35,938
You're wasting time, Captain.
Or did you think I was gone?

534
00:47:36,897 --> 00:47:42,361
Lieutenant! Do you intend
to blast a hole in the viewer?

535
00:47:44,613 --> 00:47:47,783
If the purpose of this
is to test humans,

536
00:47:47,950 --> 00:47:50,953
Your Honor, we must proceed
in our own way.

537
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:54,123
You are dilatory. You have 24 hours.

538
00:47:54,290 --> 00:47:58,502
Any further delay, and you risk summary
judgement against you, Captain.

539
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:03,924
- Sorry, sir.
- You reacted fast, Mr Worf.

540
00:48:04,091 --> 00:48:06,010
But futilely.

541
00:48:06,177 --> 00:48:08,929
I will learn to do better, sir.

542
00:48:09,096 --> 00:48:13,309
Of course you will.
We've a long voyage ahead of us.

543
00:48:17,730 --> 00:48:19,415
What do we do now, Captain,

544
00:48:19,416 --> 00:48:21,442
with their monitoring our
every move and every word?

545
00:48:21,609 --> 00:48:25,196
We do exactly what we do
if this Q never existed.

546
00:48:27,031 --> 00:48:31,285
If we're going to be damned, let's be
damned for what we really are.

547
00:48:33,996 --> 00:48:37,792
Personal log, stardate 41153.8.

548
00:48:38,417 --> 00:48:41,796
Of the 24 hours Q allotted us
to prove ourselves,

549
00:48:41,962 --> 00:48:44,548
11 have now passed
without incident.

550
00:48:44,715 --> 00:48:47,510
And yet I cannot forget
Q's prediction

551
00:48:47,676 --> 00:48:50,221
that we will face
some critical test.

552
00:48:51,413 --> 00:48:55,001
This planet's interior heat provides
an abundance of geothermal energy,

553
00:48:55,002 --> 00:48:56,919
but it's about all that this world does offer.

554
00:48:57,085 --> 00:48:59,505
And it's your belief that this is
what made it possible for them

555
00:48:59,671 --> 00:49:02,090
to construct this base
to Starfleet standards?

556
00:49:02,257 --> 00:49:05,385
Yes, sir. We have to assume that
they've been trading their surplus energy

557
00:49:05,552 --> 00:49:08,430
for the construction materials
used here.

558
00:49:08,597 --> 00:49:09,669
According to our ship's scans,

559
00:49:09,670 --> 00:49:11,600
many of the materials used
are not found on this world.

560
00:49:11,767 --> 00:49:14,937
Perhaps it's like those incidents
you've described in your report as

561
00:49:15,104 --> 00:49:17,773
"almost magical attempts
to please us".

562
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:19,691
Those events did happen, sir.

563
00:49:22,236 --> 00:49:25,239
None of it suggests
anything threatening.

564
00:49:25,405 --> 00:49:28,867
If only every life form
had as much desire to please.

565
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:34,373
Ready to beam down? I'm looking forward
to meeting this Groppler Zorn.

566
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:37,876
I have a feeling there's more to it
than just trying to please us.

567
00:49:38,043 --> 00:49:41,004
As if it's something
Q is doing to trick us?

568
00:49:41,171 --> 00:49:45,759
Over here. I've asked the Counselor
to join us in this meeting.

569
00:49:46,718 --> 00:49:50,305
May I introduce our new
First Officer, Cmdr William Riker.

570
00:49:50,472 --> 00:49:53,016
Cmdr Riker, this is our
ship's Counselor Deanna Troi.

571
00:49:54,977 --> 00:49:58,272
Do you remember
what I taught you, Imzadi?

572
00:50:00,107 --> 00:50:02,943
Can you still sense my thoughts?

573
00:50:03,819 --> 00:50:05,904
A pleasure, Commander.

574
00:50:08,323 --> 00:50:10,284
Likewise, Counselor.

575
00:50:10,451 --> 00:50:12,536
Have the two of you met before?

576
00:50:14,788 --> 00:50:16,498
We have, sir.

577
00:50:16,665 --> 00:50:18,167
Excellent.

578
00:50:21,378 --> 00:50:25,507
I consider it important
for my key officers

579
00:50:25,674 --> 00:50:27,885
to know each other's abilities.

580
00:50:28,594 --> 00:50:30,179
We do, sir.

581
00:50:31,430 --> 00:50:32,806
We do.

582
00:50:33,974 --> 00:50:37,436
I, too, could never
say goodbye, Imzadi.

583
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:49,573
My crew and I need more information

584
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:52,618
before we can make our
recommendations to Starfleet.

585
00:50:52,785 --> 00:50:54,787
No objections to that.

586
00:50:54,953 --> 00:50:58,540
But I'm puzzled over you bringing
a Betazoid to this meeting.

587
00:50:59,333 --> 00:51:02,252
If her purpose, sir, is to...
probe my thoughts...

588
00:51:02,419 --> 00:51:05,631
I can sense only strong emotions,
Groppler.

589
00:51:05,798 --> 00:51:10,135
I'm only half Betazoid.
My father was a Starfleet officer.

590
00:51:10,302 --> 00:51:13,222
Well, I have nothing to hide,
of course.

591
00:51:13,388 --> 00:51:18,143
Good, since we admire what we've
seen of your construction techniques.

592
00:51:18,310 --> 00:51:23,107
Starfleet may be interested in your
constructing starbases elsewhere, also.

593
00:51:23,273 --> 00:51:25,943
We are not interested
in building other facilities.

594
00:51:26,068 --> 00:51:27,986
If I may, Captain.

595
00:51:28,153 --> 00:51:30,948
Then a trade, Groppler.
Some things that you need in return

596
00:51:31,115 --> 00:51:35,911
for lending us architects and engineers
who can demonstrate your techniques.

597
00:51:36,078 --> 00:51:38,956
Bandi do not enjoy
leaving their homeworld.

598
00:51:39,123 --> 00:51:43,085
If Starfleet cannot accept
that small weakness,

599
00:51:43,252 --> 00:51:45,712
then we will be forced, unhappily,

600
00:51:45,879 --> 00:51:49,007
to seek an alliance
with someone like the Ferengi.

601
00:51:54,847 --> 00:51:56,849
Counselor? What is it?

602
00:51:57,516 --> 00:51:59,601
Do you want it described here, sir?

603
00:51:59,768 --> 00:52:03,605
Yes. No secrets here if we're
to be all friends, Agreed, Groppler?

604
00:52:03,772 --> 00:52:05,649
We ourselves have nothing to hide.
Of course.

605
00:52:09,987 --> 00:52:11,989
Pain.

606
00:52:17,870 --> 00:52:19,872
Loneliness.

607
00:52:21,039 --> 00:52:23,250
Terrible loneliness.

608
00:52:25,627 --> 00:52:27,629
Despair.

609
00:52:31,592 --> 00:52:35,596
I'm not sensing the Groppler, sir,
or any of his people,

610
00:52:35,763 --> 00:52:38,724
but it's something very close
to us here.

611
00:52:39,475 --> 00:52:43,312
The source of this, Groppler.
Have you any idea?

612
00:52:43,479 --> 00:52:46,982
No. No, absolutely not.

613
00:52:47,149 --> 00:52:50,444
And I find nothing helpful
or productive in any of this!

614
00:52:50,611 --> 00:52:53,030
And that's it? No other comment?

615
00:52:53,197 --> 00:52:57,201
What do you expect of us? We offer
you a base designed to your needs.

616
00:52:57,367 --> 00:52:59,411
Luxurious by even human standards.

617
00:52:59,578 --> 00:53:02,581
While evading
our simplest questions about it.

618
00:53:03,582 --> 00:53:05,292
We'll adjourn for now...

619
00:53:06,502 --> 00:53:09,171
..while we all reconsider
our positions.

620
00:53:09,755 --> 00:53:13,759
Captain! The Ferengi would be
very interested in a base like this.

621
00:53:13,926 --> 00:53:18,430
Fine. Let's hope they find you as tasty
as they did their past associates.

622
00:53:31,151 --> 00:53:33,904
Ensign, could you help me
find Cmdr Data?

623
00:53:34,071 --> 00:53:35,864
I understand, he's somewhere on this deck.

624
00:53:36,031 --> 00:53:40,786
This way, sir. You must be new
to these Galaxy-class starships.

625
00:53:40,953 --> 00:53:43,914
Tell me the location of Cmdr Data.

626
00:53:44,081 --> 00:53:49,336
Lt Cmdr Data,
now located in holodeck area 4J.

627
00:53:49,503 --> 00:53:52,756
And as you can see, sir,
it's pointing you that way.

628
00:53:54,174 --> 00:53:56,343
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, sir.

629
00:53:59,888 --> 00:54:02,307
The next hatchway on your right.

630
00:54:02,766 --> 00:54:03,725
Thank you.

631
00:54:03,892 --> 00:54:07,771
You're welcome, Cmdr Riker.
And if you care to enter, Commander...

632
00:54:07,938 --> 00:54:09,898
I do.

633
00:54:57,362 --> 00:54:58,739
Hello!

634
00:55:41,657 --> 00:55:43,242
Marvelous!

635
00:55:43,408 --> 00:55:45,828
How easily humans do that.

636
00:55:45,994 --> 00:55:47,996
I still need much practice.

637
00:55:48,622 --> 00:55:50,999
There's some puzzles down on the...

638
00:55:52,543 --> 00:55:55,754
...down on the planet that
the Captain wants answered.

639
00:55:55,921 --> 00:55:58,215
He suggests that I take you with me
on the away team that I'll be leading.

640
00:55:58,382 --> 00:56:00,884
I shall endeavor
to function adequately, sir.

641
00:56:02,177 --> 00:56:03,554
Yes.

642
00:56:08,642 --> 00:56:11,562
When the Captain suggested you,
I looked up your record.

643
00:56:11,728 --> 00:56:13,564
Yes, sir. A wise procedure, sir, always.

644
00:56:13,730 --> 00:56:16,442
Then your rank of Lieutenant Commander
is honorary?

645
00:56:16,608 --> 00:56:21,071
No, sir. Starfleet class of '78, honors in
probability and mechanics and exobiology.

646
00:56:21,238 --> 00:56:22,656
Your file says you're a...

647
00:56:22,823 --> 00:56:25,742
Machine. Correct, sir.
Does that trouble you?

648
00:56:25,909 --> 00:56:27,369
To be honest, yes, a little.

649
00:56:27,536 --> 00:56:30,873
Understood, sir.
Prejudice is very human.

650
00:56:31,039 --> 00:56:34,710
That does trouble me. Do you
consider yourself superior to us?

651
00:56:34,877 --> 00:56:37,546
I am superior, sir, in many ways...

652
00:56:37,671 --> 00:56:40,924
but I would gladly give it up,
to be human.

653
00:56:41,091 --> 00:56:44,303
Nice to meet you... Pinocchio.

654
00:56:46,096 --> 00:56:48,098
A joke.

655
00:56:49,975 --> 00:56:51,393
Aah. Intriguing.

656
00:56:52,644 --> 00:56:55,022
You'll be an interesting
companion, Mr Data.

657
00:57:02,571 --> 00:57:05,073
This woodland pattern
is quite popular, sir,

658
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:07,576
perhaps, because it duplicates
Earth so well.

659
00:57:07,743 --> 00:57:10,329
Coming here almost makes me
feel human myself.

660
00:57:10,496 --> 00:57:12,873
Couldn't believe these simulations
could be so real.

661
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:16,460
Much of it is real, sir. If the transporters
can convert our bodies

662
00:57:16,627 --> 00:57:19,087
to an energy beam and then back
to the original pattern...

663
00:57:19,254 --> 00:57:22,174
Yes, of course. And these rocks and
vegetation have much simpler patterns.

664
00:57:22,341 --> 00:57:24,343
Correct, sir.

665
00:57:24,885 --> 00:57:27,554
- The rear wall.
- I can't see it.

666
00:57:27,721 --> 00:57:29,723
We're right next to it.

667
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:37,940
Incredible!

668
00:57:47,366 --> 00:57:49,868
Cmdr Riker!
Cmdr Riker, isn't this great?

669
00:57:50,035 --> 00:57:52,204
This is one of the simple patterns.

670
00:57:52,371 --> 00:57:55,749
They've got thousands more.
Some you just can't believe.

671
00:57:55,916 --> 00:57:58,043
Careful, the next rock is loose!

672
00:58:00,796 --> 00:58:01,755
Wesley!

673
00:58:11,598 --> 00:58:13,183
Wow!

674
00:58:24,403 --> 00:58:27,781
Mr Data has agreed to join me
on the away team, Captain.

675
00:58:27,948 --> 00:58:29,575
Very good, Commander.

676
00:58:31,827 --> 00:58:35,497
Sir, maybe I should get something
to wipe this water up.

677
00:58:36,540 --> 00:58:37,875
Good idea.

678
00:58:46,383 --> 00:58:48,927
There's a low-gravity
gymnasium, too.

679
00:58:49,094 --> 00:58:51,346
It'd be hard to get bored
on this ship.

680
00:58:51,513 --> 00:58:52,473
Good.

681
00:58:58,812 --> 00:59:02,274
Mom, could you get me a look
at the bridge?

682
00:59:02,441 --> 00:59:04,491
That's against the
Captain's standing orders.

683
00:59:04,492 --> 00:59:06,028
Are you afraid of the Captain, too?

684
00:59:06,195 --> 00:59:08,572
I certainly am not.

685
00:59:09,740 --> 00:59:12,075
But Capt Picard is a pain, isn't he?

686
00:59:12,242 --> 00:59:16,538
Your father liked him very much.
Great explorers are often lonely.

687
00:59:16,705 --> 00:59:18,707
No chance to have a family.

688
00:59:20,501 --> 00:59:21,887
Just a look at the bridge.

689
00:59:21,888 --> 00:59:25,897
I'll stay in the turbolift when
the doors open. I won't get off.

690
00:59:25,898 --> 00:59:27,716
You are asking for trouble, Wes.

691
00:59:35,015 --> 00:59:36,642
We'll see what we can do.

692
00:59:49,905 --> 00:59:53,575
Recommend that someone could begin by
examining the underside of the station, sir.

693
00:59:53,742 --> 00:59:56,078
Our sensors do show some passages, sir.

694
00:59:56,245 --> 00:59:59,540
- Perhaps you and l?
- Tasha, you and the Counselor.

695
00:59:59,706 --> 01:00:02,501
And, Geordi,
I want your eyes down there.

696
01:00:02,668 --> 01:00:04,670
You and I will start topside.

697
01:00:36,994 --> 01:00:38,579
Have you noticed anything unusual?

698
01:00:38,745 --> 01:00:42,124
I can't see as well as Geordi, sir, but so far
the material seems rather ordinary.

699
01:00:42,291 --> 01:00:43,291
Construction records?

700
01:00:43,292 --> 01:00:48,292
Construction records shows us to be
almost identical to what Starfleet uses.

701
01:00:49,756 --> 01:00:51,884
Team leader?

702
01:00:52,050 --> 01:00:54,553
We've found something interesting.

703
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:58,348
We're in a passageway
directly under the station, sir.

704
01:00:58,515 --> 01:01:01,435
That these tunnel walls are something
I've never seen before, sir.

705
01:01:01,602 --> 01:01:03,854
- How are you examining them, Geordi?
- In every way.

706
01:01:04,021 --> 01:01:07,274
Microscopically,
thermally, electromagnetically.

707
01:01:07,441 --> 01:01:11,028
- None of it is familiar.
- What about you, Troi?

708
01:01:12,571 --> 01:01:15,824
Sir, I've avoided opening my mind.

709
01:01:15,991 --> 01:01:19,828
Whatever I felt in Groppler's office
became very uncomfortable.

710
01:01:19,995 --> 01:01:22,748
I'm sorry, Counselor, but you must.
We need more information.

711
01:01:29,171 --> 01:01:30,130
Pain.

712
01:01:32,341 --> 01:01:33,926
Such pain!

713
01:01:35,928 --> 01:01:36,528
Pain.

714
01:01:36,929 --> 01:01:39,973
Hang on. I'm coming. Enterprise,
lock us on to her signal.

715
01:01:51,276 --> 01:01:54,113
I'm sorry.
Close your mind to the pain.

716
01:01:55,614 --> 01:01:57,199
Unhappiness.

717
01:01:58,617 --> 01:02:00,619
Terrible despair.

718
01:02:00,786 --> 01:02:02,788
Who?

719
01:02:04,123 --> 01:02:06,125
I don't know.

720
01:02:06,792 --> 01:02:08,877
No life form anything like us.

721
01:02:09,878 --> 01:02:12,297
What in the hell kind of place
is this?

722
01:02:12,464 --> 01:02:15,884
- Geordi, what do you see?
- Well, it's of...

723
01:02:17,344 --> 01:02:21,974
It's of no material I recognize, sir,
or have even heard of.

724
01:02:46,457 --> 01:02:48,459
What the hell?

725
01:02:48,667 --> 01:02:51,128
Children are not allowed
on the bridge.

726
01:02:57,384 --> 01:03:00,053
Permission to report to the Captain.

727
01:03:00,637 --> 01:03:03,891
- Dr Crusher.
- Captain.

728
01:03:05,309 --> 01:03:09,521
Sir, my son is not on the bridge,
he merely accompanied me on the turbolift.

729
01:03:15,194 --> 01:03:18,489
- Your son?
- His name's Wesley.

730
01:03:19,865 --> 01:03:22,201
You last saw him years ago when...

731
01:03:33,462 --> 01:03:34,421
Well...

732
01:03:37,007 --> 01:03:39,009
...as long as he's here...

733
01:03:41,887 --> 01:03:43,555
I...

734
01:03:45,015 --> 01:03:47,017
I knew...

735
01:03:49,311 --> 01:03:51,313
I knew your father, Wesley.

736
01:03:54,691 --> 01:03:56,276
Want to look around?

737
01:04:15,671 --> 01:04:17,589
But don't touch anything!

738
01:04:35,816 --> 01:04:37,401
Try it out.

739
01:04:44,450 --> 01:04:47,244
The panel on your right
is for log entries,

740
01:04:47,411 --> 01:04:52,583
library computer access, retrieval,
view screen control and intercom. So, here...

741
01:04:52,749 --> 01:04:56,378
And here the backup conn and ops panels,
plus shield and armory controls.

742
01:04:56,545 --> 01:05:00,549
Hm. Uh, the forward viewscreen
is controlled from the ops position there...

743
01:05:00,716 --> 01:05:03,385
Which uses high-resolution,
multi-spectral imaging sensors.

744
01:05:03,510 --> 01:05:05,095
How the hell do you know that, boy?

745
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:08,390
- Perimeter alert, Captain!
- Wesley!

746
01:05:08,557 --> 01:05:09,683
I'm sorry. (Wes, you shouldn't touch)
I didn't...

747
01:05:09,850 --> 01:05:11,894
Get off the bridge! Both of you!

748
01:05:12,060 --> 01:05:15,981
- You have a perimeter alert, sir.
- As my son tried to tell you.

749
01:05:19,985 --> 01:05:21,153
Picard. Go ahead.

750
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:24,782
Ship sensors have detected the presence
of a vessel approaching this planet.

751
01:05:24,948 --> 01:05:27,284
No ship is scheduled to arrive
at this time, sir.

752
01:05:27,451 --> 01:05:30,037
Have Riker and his team beam back up.

753
01:05:30,204 --> 01:05:32,581
Security, could that be the Hood
returning here?

754
01:05:32,748 --> 01:05:35,876
The vessel does not match
the Hood's configuration or ID signal.

755
01:05:36,043 --> 01:05:39,463
Put it on main viewer.
Identification?

756
01:05:39,630 --> 01:05:42,382
Vessel unknown,
configuration unknown, sir.

757
01:05:51,934 --> 01:05:52,893
Hail it.

758
01:05:53,685 --> 01:05:56,438
We've been trying, sir.
No response.

759
01:06:01,735 --> 01:06:06,073
- Raise all shields, phasers at ready.
- Shields up, sir, phasers ready.

760
01:06:23,798 --> 01:06:25,258
Get me Groppler Zorn.

761
01:06:25,425 --> 01:06:28,219
And continue universal greetings
on all frequencies.

762
01:06:28,386 --> 01:06:29,971
This is Zorn, Captain.

763
01:06:30,138 --> 01:06:33,683
Zorn, an unidentified vessel
has entered into orbit with us.

764
01:06:33,850 --> 01:06:35,393
Do you know who it is?

765
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:38,020
There are no ships scheduled
to arrive until...

766
01:06:38,187 --> 01:06:40,154
I asked you if you knew who it is.

767
01:06:40,155 --> 01:06:42,525
You mentioned the
Ferengi Alliance to me.

768
01:06:44,110 --> 01:06:46,904
But we've had no dealings with them.

769
01:06:47,071 --> 01:06:48,990
It... It was only a - a thought.

770
01:06:49,157 --> 01:06:51,492
- Are you certain?
- I promise you, Captain.

771
01:06:51,659 --> 01:06:56,110
We were making an empty threat.
I wanted your cooperation.

772
01:06:56,111 --> 01:06:56,789
Forgive me.

773
01:06:56,956 --> 01:06:59,125
Definitely entering orbital trajectory, sir.

774
01:06:59,292 --> 01:07:01,502
It measures 12 times our volume, Captain.

775
01:07:33,993 --> 01:07:36,996
Sensors say we were just scanned, sir.

776
01:07:42,710 --> 01:07:44,086
Pain again?

777
01:07:46,506 --> 01:07:49,550
- Troi, you've been at it enough.
- No.

778
01:07:50,384 --> 01:07:53,096
I feel close
to an answer of some kind.

779
01:07:53,262 --> 01:07:57,391
Commander, something down here
is shielding our communicators.

780
01:07:57,558 --> 01:08:00,478
Yes, that's exactly the feeling
I've been reading,

781
01:08:00,645 --> 01:08:04,023
as if someone doesn't want us
to be in touch with our ship.

782
01:08:04,190 --> 01:08:05,900
Come on, let's get to the surface.

783
01:08:13,324 --> 01:08:16,869
There is no computer record
of any such vessel, sir.

784
01:08:17,036 --> 01:08:18,371
Nothing even close.

785
01:08:18,538 --> 01:08:21,499
Still no response. We've done
everything but threaten them.

786
01:08:25,461 --> 01:08:27,463
Sensor scans, Mr Worf.

787
01:08:28,089 --> 01:08:31,217
Our sensor signals
just seem to bounce off.

788
01:08:31,384 --> 01:08:33,261
Something's happening, sir.

789
01:08:35,138 --> 01:08:39,142
- They're firing on Farpoint, sir.
- Bring photon torpedoes to ready.

790
01:08:39,308 --> 01:08:42,395
Wait, sir. They're hitting the old
Bandi city, not Farpoint Station.

791
01:09:01,414 --> 01:09:03,569
Those stairs are where
we entered down here, sir.

792
01:09:03,570 --> 01:09:06,544
At this point it becomes ordinary stone, sir.
Matching what's above.

793
01:09:09,714 --> 01:09:14,302
- My God! Was that a phaser blast?
- Negative. But something similar.

794
01:09:17,388 --> 01:09:19,682
You, Tasha, Geordi,
will beam up to the ship now.

795
01:09:19,849 --> 01:09:21,642
Come on, I wanna see exactly
what's happening.

796
01:09:26,773 --> 01:09:28,649
Don't! If you should be hurt...

797
01:09:29,317 --> 01:09:32,361
You have your orders, Lieutenant.
Carry them out.

798
01:09:33,321 --> 01:09:35,907
Yes, sir. I'm sorry, sir.

799
01:09:39,202 --> 01:09:42,079
Enterprise, three to beam up.

800
01:09:52,381 --> 01:09:55,051
Enterprise! Enterprise, come in!

801
01:09:55,551 --> 01:09:57,553
Help us! Please!

802
01:09:59,931 --> 01:10:01,015
What shall we do?

803
01:10:01,182 --> 01:10:03,476
Enterprise, help us! Please!

804
01:10:03,643 --> 01:10:07,480
Tune that down. Cmdr Riker,
come in. Can you hear me?

805
01:10:13,611 --> 01:10:15,446
Riker to Enterprise, come in.

806
01:10:15,613 --> 01:10:18,074
Cmdr Riker, come in.
Where are you?

807
01:10:18,241 --> 01:10:20,910
With Data,
on the edge of the old city.

808
01:10:22,370 --> 01:10:23,871
It's being hit hard, sir.

809
01:10:24,038 --> 01:10:26,290
And Farpoint Station?
Any damage there?

810
01:10:26,457 --> 01:10:28,876
Negative on damage to Farpoint, sir.

811
01:10:29,043 --> 01:10:31,295
Whatever they are, they are carefully
avoiding hitting the station.

812
01:10:31,462 --> 01:10:34,674
It's from an unidentified vessel
that's entered into orbit with us here.

813
01:10:34,841 --> 01:10:37,176
No ID, no answer to our signals.

814
01:10:37,343 --> 01:10:39,470
The old Bandi city's
being hit hard, sir.

815
01:10:39,637 --> 01:10:43,015
- Many casualties. Very probable.
- Understand, Commander.

816
01:10:43,182 --> 01:10:47,019
Would you object to your Captain
ordering a clearly illegal kidnapping?

817
01:10:48,229 --> 01:10:49,522
No objection, sir.

818
01:10:49,689 --> 01:10:53,985
Groppler Zorn may have the answers
we need. Get him, bring him here.

819
01:10:54,152 --> 01:10:55,570
Aye, sir.

820
01:11:03,453 --> 01:11:05,955
They're forcing a very difficult decision
on me, Counselor.

821
01:11:06,122 --> 01:11:09,292
But I doubt, protecting the Bandi
would violate the Prime Directive.

822
01:11:09,459 --> 01:11:11,335
True, they are not actual allies, but...

823
01:11:11,502 --> 01:11:15,506
We are in the midst
of diplomatic discussions with them.

824
01:11:15,673 --> 01:11:18,217
Lieutenant,
lock phasers on that vessel.

825
01:11:19,343 --> 01:11:20,845
Phasers locked on, Captain.

826
01:11:24,182 --> 01:11:26,476
Typical. So typical.

827
01:11:26,642 --> 01:11:30,480
Savage life forms
never follow even their own rules.

828
01:11:37,302 --> 01:11:38,679
Get off my bridge!

829
01:11:41,389 --> 01:11:42,890
Interesting, that order about phasers.

830
01:11:42,891 --> 01:11:44,518
Standing by on phasers, Captain.

831
01:11:44,685 --> 01:11:47,062
Please - don't let me interfere.
Use your weapons.

832
01:11:47,229 --> 01:11:50,941
We've no idea who is on that vessel.
My order was a safety precaution.

833
01:11:51,108 --> 01:11:53,443
Really? No idea what it represents?

834
01:11:53,610 --> 01:11:55,612
The meaning of that vessel
is as plain,

835
01:11:55,779 --> 01:11:58,865
as plain as the noses
on your ugly little primate faces.

836
01:11:59,032 --> 01:12:00,951
And if you were truly civilized, Captain,

837
01:12:01,118 --> 01:12:04,997
wouldn't you be doing something
about the casualties down there?

838
01:12:05,163 --> 01:12:07,833
Captain to CMO,
are you reading any of this?

839
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,877
Medical team already preparing
to beam down, Captain.

840
01:12:11,044 --> 01:12:13,714
Compliments on that, Doctor.

841
01:12:13,880 --> 01:12:15,132
Any questions?

842
01:12:15,298 --> 01:12:18,260
Starfleet people are trained to render
aid and assistance whenever...

843
01:12:18,427 --> 01:12:22,597
- But not trained in clear thinking.
- Let's consider your thoughts.

844
01:12:22,764 --> 01:12:25,627
You call us savages, and yet you knew
those people down there

845
01:12:25,628 --> 01:12:26,643
were going to be killed.

846
01:12:26,810 --> 01:12:28,937
It is your conduct
that is uncivilized.

847
01:12:29,938 --> 01:12:31,773
Sir, they're firing on the planet again.

848
01:12:34,693 --> 01:12:38,572
Go to maneuvering jets. Position us
between that vessel and the planet.

849
01:12:38,739 --> 01:12:41,158
- Force fields full on.
- Aye, sir.

850
01:12:43,660 --> 01:12:45,662
Impulse power to...

851
01:12:46,455 --> 01:12:48,123
We have no ship control, sir.

852
01:12:49,958 --> 01:12:51,293
It's gone!

853
01:13:08,101 --> 01:13:09,436
Are you undamaged?

854
01:13:09,603 --> 01:13:11,563
Yes. You?

855
01:13:19,613 --> 01:13:21,615
All systems operating.

856
01:13:40,384 --> 01:13:43,178
Please! Make it stop!

857
01:13:43,345 --> 01:13:45,180
You can drive it away!

858
01:13:45,347 --> 01:13:47,391
Drive who away, Groppler?

859
01:13:47,557 --> 01:13:49,351
- I don't know.
- Unlikely, sir..

860
01:13:49,518 --> 01:13:53,563
Our records show you supervised
all Bandi contact with other worlds.

861
01:13:53,730 --> 01:13:55,273
We've done nothing wrong!

862
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:58,443
Then, if we can learn nothing
from you, we'll leave.

863
01:13:58,610 --> 01:14:01,279
No! Oh no, please, don't leave!

864
01:14:01,405 --> 01:14:03,615
I - I'll... try to explain.

865
01:14:13,625 --> 01:14:15,711
First Officer to Enterprise.

866
01:14:18,630 --> 01:14:20,215
We've lost Zorn.

867
01:14:22,050 --> 01:14:25,470
Something like a transporter beam
seems to have snatched him away.

868
01:14:25,637 --> 01:14:29,558
Question, sir...
Could it be this Q?

869
01:14:29,725 --> 01:14:32,185
None of you knows
who transported him.

870
01:14:32,352 --> 01:14:34,062
You're running out of time, Captain.

871
01:14:34,229 --> 01:14:38,150
Captain!
Suddenly I'm sensing something else.

872
01:14:40,527 --> 01:14:42,112
Satisfaction.

873
01:14:43,488 --> 01:14:47,159
- Enormous satisfaction.
- From the same source as before?

874
01:14:47,326 --> 01:14:50,412
No. That was on the planet.
This is much closer.

875
01:14:50,579 --> 01:14:53,540
Excellent, Counselor.
He's such a dullard, isn't he?

876
01:14:56,710 --> 01:15:00,756
Captain from transporter room: First
Officer and Mr Data have beamed aboard.

877
01:15:00,922 --> 01:15:03,717
Excellent also. Perhaps with more
reasonable minds helping...

878
01:15:03,884 --> 01:15:04,926
That is enough! Damn it!

879
01:15:05,093 --> 01:15:07,095
Have you forgotten
that we have an agreement?

880
01:15:07,262 --> 01:15:10,515
An agreement which you are, at this
moment, breaking by taking over our vessel,

881
01:15:10,682 --> 01:15:12,559
interfering with my decisions.

882
01:15:14,770 --> 01:15:17,981
- Either leave or finish us!
- Temper, temper, mon capitaine.

883
01:15:18,148 --> 01:15:21,526
I'm merely trying to assist
a pitiful species.

884
01:15:21,693 --> 01:15:25,489
But perhaps I will leave if Riker
provides me with some amusement.

885
01:15:25,656 --> 01:15:27,115
Do nothing that he asks.

886
01:15:27,282 --> 01:15:32,120
But I ask so little, and it's so necessary
if you're to all solve this.

887
01:15:32,287 --> 01:15:35,749
Beam over there with your...
what do you call it? Your away team?

888
01:15:35,916 --> 01:15:38,001
I'll risk none of my crew on that unknown.

889
01:15:38,168 --> 01:15:40,865
You should already know
what you'll find there.

890
01:15:40,866 --> 01:15:42,214
Perhaps it's too adult a puzzle for you.

891
01:15:43,715 --> 01:15:47,135
With all respect, Captain...
I want to beam over there.

892
01:15:47,302 --> 01:15:49,721
You show promise, my good fellow.

893
01:15:49,888 --> 01:15:53,183
Have you understood any part
of what he's tried to tell you?

894
01:15:53,350 --> 01:15:56,019
Humanity is no longer a savage race.

895
01:15:57,521 --> 01:15:59,564
But you must still prove that.

896
01:16:06,321 --> 01:16:09,324
At least, you impressed him,
Number One. That's hopeful.

897
01:16:10,617 --> 01:16:12,077
Thank you, Captain.

898
01:16:13,495 --> 01:16:15,872
Captain, if he's not open
to evidence in our favor,

899
01:16:16,039 --> 01:16:17,791
where will you go from there?

900
01:16:17,958 --> 01:16:20,669
- I'll attend to my duty.
- To the bitter end?

901
01:16:20,836 --> 01:16:23,714
I see nothing so bitter about that.

902
01:16:30,512 --> 01:16:32,514
Can I help you, Captain?

903
01:16:34,266 --> 01:16:35,225
I...

904
01:16:36,226 --> 01:16:38,979
I didn't want you thinking me harsh.

905
01:16:39,146 --> 01:16:41,857
- Cold-blooded.
- Why, why would I ever think that?

906
01:16:42,024 --> 01:16:45,736
I didn't welcome you aboard,
personally, professionally.

907
01:16:45,902 --> 01:16:49,031
I made you come to me on the bridge,
I yelled at your son.

908
01:16:49,197 --> 01:16:52,034
Who, as you...
pointed out, was quite correct.

909
01:16:52,659 --> 01:16:56,455
He seems to have a very good grasp
of starship operations.

910
01:16:57,706 --> 01:17:00,000
You've just won
this mother's heart, Captain.

911
01:17:02,336 --> 01:17:06,506
Ah. But... now your... assignment here.

912
01:17:06,673 --> 01:17:11,470
I would... consider... and approve...

913
01:17:11,636 --> 01:17:13,638
a transfer for you.

914
01:17:15,807 --> 01:17:17,809
Ooh. You consider me unqualified?

915
01:17:17,976 --> 01:17:22,481
Hardly. Your service record shows that you're
just the Chief Medical Officer I want.

916
01:17:22,647 --> 01:17:24,396
Then you object to me personally?

917
01:17:24,397 --> 01:17:27,194
I'm trying to be considerate
of your feelings, Doctor.

918
01:17:27,361 --> 01:17:29,738
For you to...
work with a commanding officer

919
01:17:29,905 --> 01:17:34,701
who would continually remind you of a...
terrible, personal tragedy.

920
01:17:34,868 --> 01:17:36,662
If I had had any objections
to serving with you,

921
01:17:36,828 --> 01:17:39,665
I wouldn't have requested
this assignment, Captain.

922
01:17:40,957 --> 01:17:42,876
You requested this posting?

923
01:17:43,043 --> 01:17:45,295
My feelings about my husband's death

924
01:17:45,462 --> 01:17:48,548
will have no affect on the way I serve you,
this vessel or this mission.

925
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:52,300
Aah.

926
01:17:53,720 --> 01:17:55,555
Then, welcome aboard, Doctor.

927
01:17:56,181 --> 01:17:59,267
Riker to Picard.
We're ready to beam over, sir.

928
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:04,314
I... I hope we can be friends?

929
01:18:05,399 --> 01:18:06,566
Thank you.

930
01:18:18,693 --> 01:18:20,236
Phasers on stun.

931
01:18:27,285 --> 01:18:28,870
Energise.

932
01:18:47,931 --> 01:18:49,933
Most interesting, sir.

933
01:18:52,268 --> 01:18:55,897
It's the same construction
we saw in the underground tunnel.

934
01:18:56,064 --> 01:18:57,982
But no sound of power.

935
01:18:58,149 --> 01:19:00,193
No equipment.

936
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:02,362
How does this ship run?

937
01:19:05,740 --> 01:19:07,325
What is it, Troi?

938
01:19:07,492 --> 01:19:09,619
Is it the same
as you felt down there?

939
01:19:09,786 --> 01:19:10,954
No.

940
01:19:11,788 --> 01:19:14,457
This is much more powerful.

941
01:19:15,875 --> 01:19:17,627
Full of anger!

942
01:19:18,711 --> 01:19:19,671
Hate!

943
01:19:19,837 --> 01:19:22,674
- Toward us?
- No.

944
01:19:23,675 --> 01:19:27,178
It's directed down
towards the old Bandi city.

945
01:19:27,345 --> 01:19:29,556
Most intriguing again, sir.

946
01:19:30,473 --> 01:19:35,186
The place this vessel was firing upon
was not the Farpoint starbase,

947
01:19:35,353 --> 01:19:38,022
but the home of those
who constructed...

948
01:19:39,941 --> 01:19:41,317
Sorry, sir.

949
01:19:42,527 --> 01:19:45,113
I seem to be commenting
on everything.

950
01:19:46,239 --> 01:19:47,615
Good.

951
01:19:48,575 --> 01:19:50,285
Don't stop, my friend.

952
01:19:56,624 --> 01:19:58,543
Enterprise, Riker.

953
01:19:58,710 --> 01:20:02,755
This is turning out to be
a very long tunnel or corridor, sir.

954
01:20:02,922 --> 01:20:04,924
No ship's crew in sight.

955
01:20:05,091 --> 01:20:07,510
No sign of mechanism or circuitry.

956
01:20:08,177 --> 01:20:10,179
No controls or read-outs.

957
01:20:11,848 --> 01:20:14,851
This is nothing like any vessel
I've seen before.

958
01:20:15,018 --> 01:20:17,020
Groppler Zorn, sir.

959
01:20:18,146 --> 01:20:20,481
A great fear just ahead.

960
01:20:20,648 --> 01:20:24,694
There's a different feeling here
than in the tunnel.

961
01:20:25,278 --> 01:20:26,946
Very different.

962
01:20:28,573 --> 01:20:33,000
No! Please! No more, please!
No more!

963
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:38,291
Please! Make it stop! Please!

964
01:20:40,001 --> 01:20:43,630
Please! Please! Make it stop!

965
01:20:46,966 --> 01:20:50,500
No! Please! No more!
Please, no more!

966
01:20:53,139 --> 01:20:55,475
- Please!
- Zorn, can you hear me?

967
01:20:55,642 --> 01:20:57,644
The pain!

968
01:20:59,103 --> 01:21:02,524
- No!
- Has the alien communicated?

969
01:21:02,690 --> 01:21:04,317
Please!

970
01:21:04,484 --> 01:21:07,070
- Please! No more!
- That's it, sir.

971
01:21:08,071 --> 01:21:10,532
It's just one alien I'm sensing here.

972
01:21:10,698 --> 01:21:14,160
Please!
I don't understand what you want!

973
01:21:14,327 --> 01:21:16,079
Not true, he does know.

974
01:21:16,078 --> 01:21:19,000
No please! No more, please!
No more!

975
01:21:21,543 --> 01:21:24,000
No! No! No!
Don't!

976
01:21:34,700 --> 01:21:35,500
Captain!

977
01:21:36,850 --> 01:21:39,519
Transporter Chief,
yank them back. Now!

978
01:21:40,061 --> 01:21:41,646
Riker, acknowledge!

979
01:21:42,772 --> 01:21:44,983
Your time is up, Captain.

980
01:21:46,067 --> 01:21:48,800
Transporter Chief,
do you have their coordinates?

981
01:21:48,801 --> 01:21:49,570
Transporter Chief!

982
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:52,740
- He can't hear you, Captain.
- Transporter Chief, come in!

983
01:21:58,371 --> 01:22:02,041
I have people...
in trouble over there, Q.

984
01:22:08,381 --> 01:22:10,258
Everyone at ease. That's an order.

985
01:22:13,428 --> 01:22:16,890
Q, my people are in trouble.

986
01:22:17,056 --> 01:22:19,309
Let me help them, please.

987
01:22:23,771 --> 01:22:25,690
I'll do whatever you say.

988
01:22:32,822 --> 01:22:35,074
You'll do whatever I say?

989
01:22:37,994 --> 01:22:39,996
It seems I did make that bargain.

990
01:22:40,163 --> 01:22:43,416
The agreement isn't valid, sir.
It wasn't Q that saved us.

991
01:22:43,583 --> 01:22:46,002
Save yourself. It may attack you now.

992
01:22:46,169 --> 01:22:48,087
It was that which sent us back, Captain.

993
01:22:48,254 --> 01:22:51,799
Yes, sir. It is not merely a vessel.
Somehow it is alive.

994
01:22:51,966 --> 01:22:56,054
She lies. Destroy it, while you have a chance.
Make phasers and photon torpedoes ready.

995
01:22:56,221 --> 01:22:59,807
- No, do nothing he demands.
- Captain, that thing was killing my people!

996
01:22:59,974 --> 01:23:01,069
Was there a reason?

997
01:23:01,070 --> 01:23:03,520
It is an unknown, Captain.
Isn't that enough?

998
01:23:04,103 --> 01:23:06,064
If you'd earned that uniform you're wearing,

999
01:23:06,231 --> 01:23:08,900
you'd know that the unknown
is what brings us out here.

1000
01:23:09,067 --> 01:23:11,653
A wasted effort,
considering human intelligence.

1001
01:23:11,819 --> 01:23:15,698
Let's test that. Beginning with the tunnels
you have under Farpoint, Groppler.

1002
01:23:15,865 --> 01:23:19,619
Identical to those on the space
vessel life form over there.

1003
01:23:19,786 --> 01:23:21,329
Why was it punishing you, Groppler?

1004
01:23:21,496 --> 01:23:24,666
In return for some pain
you'd given another creature?

1005
01:23:24,832 --> 01:23:28,211
We've done nothing wrong.
It was injured. We helped it.

1006
01:23:30,547 --> 01:23:32,131
Thank you.

1007
01:23:32,757 --> 01:23:35,051
That was the missing element.

1008
01:23:35,218 --> 01:23:40,014
Lt Yar, rig main phaser banks
to deliver an energy beam.

1009
01:23:40,181 --> 01:23:41,015
Aye, sir.

1010
01:23:41,182 --> 01:23:45,270
You're right, Captain. It has to be
conceivable that somewhere in this galaxy

1011
01:23:45,436 --> 01:23:49,274
there could exist creatures
able to convert energy into matter.

1012
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:53,444
And into specific patterns of matter,
just as our transporters do.

1013
01:23:54,112 --> 01:23:55,500
On the viewer, Captain!

1014
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:37,113
Groppler... You...
captured something like that, didn't you?

1015
01:24:39,032 --> 01:24:42,660
Warn my people, please, to leave
Farpoint Station immediately.

1016
01:24:42,827 --> 01:24:45,246
He lies, Captain.
Shouldn't you let his people die?

1017
01:24:45,413 --> 01:24:48,583
Transmit the message, "Leave
Farpoint Space Station immediately."

1018
01:24:48,750 --> 01:24:51,002
Then it was a pair of creatures
I was sensing.

1019
01:24:51,628 --> 01:24:54,505
One down there in grief and pain...

1020
01:24:55,006 --> 01:24:57,258
...the other up here
filled with anger.

1021
01:24:57,425 --> 01:24:59,636
And firing not on the new space station,

1022
01:24:59,802 --> 01:25:03,181
but on the Bandi and their city.

1023
01:25:03,723 --> 01:25:06,392
Attacking those who had captured...

1024
01:25:09,395 --> 01:25:11,147
...captured its mate.

1025
01:25:18,112 --> 01:25:20,156
Energy beam ready.

1026
01:25:20,323 --> 01:25:22,408
Lock it in on Farpoint Station.

1027
01:25:25,453 --> 01:25:28,122
I see now
it was too simple a puzzle.

1028
01:25:28,289 --> 01:25:32,043
Generosity
has always been my... weakness.

1029
01:25:32,210 --> 01:25:34,629
Let it have whatever it can absorb.

1030
01:25:35,755 --> 01:25:37,590
Energise.

1031
01:25:55,233 --> 01:25:57,777
Now getting feedback on the beam, sir.

1032
01:25:57,944 --> 01:25:59,112
Discontinue.

1033
01:26:01,500 --> 01:26:06,786
Groppler Zorn, there'll soon be no
Farpoint Station, if I'm right about this.

1034
01:26:06,953 --> 01:26:08,413
A lucky guess.

1035
01:26:29,142 --> 01:26:33,313
Please, believe me. We meant no harm to
the creature. It was starving for energy.

1036
01:26:33,479 --> 01:26:35,481
Which your world furnishes you in plenty.

1037
01:26:35,648 --> 01:26:36,941
We did feed it.

1038
01:26:37,108 --> 01:26:38,818
Only enough to keep it alive,

1039
01:26:38,985 --> 01:26:43,114
so you could force it to shape itself
into whatever form you needed!

1040
01:27:57,856 --> 01:27:59,649
Sir!

1041
01:28:00,775 --> 01:28:02,151
Wonderful!

1042
01:28:07,740 --> 01:28:09,993
A feeling of great joy.

1043
01:28:12,287 --> 01:28:14,455
And gratitude.

1044
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:23,000
Great joy. And gratitude.

1045
01:28:25,717 --> 01:28:27,302
From both of them.

1046
01:28:46,196 --> 01:28:48,198
Why...

1047
01:28:49,073 --> 01:28:52,076
..do you use other life forms
for your recreation?

1048
01:28:52,243 --> 01:28:54,537
If so,
you've not provided the best.

1049
01:28:54,704 --> 01:28:57,415
Leave us!
We've passed your little test.

1050
01:28:57,582 --> 01:28:59,792
Temper, temper, mon capitaine.

1051
01:28:59,959 --> 01:29:04,505
- Get off my ship!
- I do so only because it suits me to leave.

1052
01:29:08,009 --> 01:29:11,221
But I will not promise
never to appear again.

1053
01:29:25,193 --> 01:29:28,821
Captain's log, stardate 41174.2.

1054
01:29:28,988 --> 01:29:31,658
The agreement for the rebuilding
Farpoint Station

1055
01:29:31,824 --> 01:29:34,244
has been completed
per my instructions.

1056
01:29:34,410 --> 01:29:37,497
- All stations?
- Ready for departure, sir.

1057
01:29:40,208 --> 01:29:41,584
Some problem, Riker?

1058
01:29:41,751 --> 01:29:45,046
Just hoping this isn't
the usual way our missions will go, sir.

1059
01:29:45,213 --> 01:29:49,842
Oh no, Number One. I'm sure
most will be much more interesting.

1060
01:29:53,221 --> 01:29:55,223
Let's see what's out there.

1061
01:29:56,724 --> 01:29:57,851
Engage.

1062
