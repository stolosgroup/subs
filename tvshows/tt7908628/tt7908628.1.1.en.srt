1
00:00:04,985 --> 00:00:06,634
It's nightfall.

2
00:00:09,475 --> 00:00:11,164
The job of a vampire's familiar

3
00:00:11,189 --> 00:00:13,148
is not an easy one.

4
00:00:13,173 --> 00:00:14,250
It's very dangerous.

5
00:00:14,275 --> 00:00:16,640
I mean, they are vampires, after all.

6
00:00:16,751 --> 00:00:18,602
We can go in now.

7
00:00:25,382 --> 00:00:26,984
Good evening, Master.

8
00:00:27,009 --> 00:00:28,881
Guillermo?

9
00:00:28,906 --> 00:00:30,299
Yes, sir?

10
00:00:30,324 --> 00:00:32,623
- Is that you?
- Yes, Master.

11
00:00:32,648 --> 00:00:34,186
- Okay.
- Okay, Master.

12
00:00:34,211 --> 00:00:36,538
It's time to... rise.

13
00:00:36,856 --> 00:00:38,902
The... Okay.

14
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,922
Guillermo, it is stuck.

15
00:00:44,947 --> 00:00:46,548
I think it is the latch.

16
00:00:46,573 --> 00:00:48,140
Being a vampire's familiar

17
00:00:48,165 --> 00:00:50,010
is like being a best friend.

18
00:00:50,841 --> 00:00:52,664
Who-Who's also a slave.

19
00:00:52,689 --> 00:00:54,807
Guillermo, it's too loud.-What?

20
00:00:54,832 --> 00:00:56,334
Tomorrow night marks

21
00:00:56,359 --> 00:00:58,102
the ten-year anniversary since

22
00:00:58,127 --> 00:00:59,932
I started working for my Master.

23
00:00:59,957 --> 00:01:03,607
I think he's planning
something pretty special.

24
00:01:04,411 --> 00:01:07,111
I think he's gonna make me a vampire.

25
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:10,831
This is very embarrassing.

26
00:01:10,856 --> 00:01:12,462
Okay, Master.

27
00:01:12,487 --> 00:01:13,992
He awakens.

28
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,074
OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN
from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn

29
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,396
Very cool, Master.

30
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:28,596
Very scary.

31
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:29,640
Thank you.

33
00:02:07,638 --> 00:02:09,156
Everyone?

34
00:02:09,181 --> 00:02:11,007
Nadja, Laszlo.

35
00:02:11,032 --> 00:02:11,984
- Yeah?
- Yes?

36
00:02:12,009 --> 00:02:13,060
Can you come downstairs

37
00:02:13,085 --> 00:02:14,844
for a second, please?

38
00:02:15,285 --> 00:02:17,504
Thank you, Laszlo.

39
00:02:17,529 --> 00:02:19,690
In your own time, Nadja.

40
00:02:19,715 --> 00:02:21,023
Yes, good, excellent.

41
00:02:21,048 --> 00:02:22,093
So, listen.

42
00:02:22,118 --> 00:02:23,895
We have received a letter

43
00:02:24,121 --> 00:02:26,907
and I would like very
much to read it to you.

44
00:02:26,932 --> 00:02:29,203
But not here, we want
to go into the library.

45
00:02:29,228 --> 00:02:29,914
Why not here?

46
00:02:29,939 --> 00:02:31,898
I'd like to read it in there.
It's just a formality.

47
00:02:31,923 --> 00:02:32,929
It'll sound exactly the same if you

48
00:02:32,954 --> 00:02:34,739
read it here than if
you read it in there.

49
00:02:34,764 --> 00:02:36,766
I'm not going to disagree with
you, but that's not the point.

50
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:38,114
I was a very ferocious soldier

51
00:02:38,139 --> 00:02:39,836
in the Ottoman Empire.

52
00:02:39,861 --> 00:02:43,690
Which meant a lot of
killing, lot of pillaging.

53
00:02:43,715 --> 00:02:47,371
People would say, "Please,
don't pillage me."

54
00:02:47,396 --> 00:02:49,398
And I would say, "No.

55
00:02:49,423 --> 00:02:52,799
I'm pillaging everyone, you included."

56
00:02:53,152 --> 00:02:54,800
I was relentless.

57
00:02:54,825 --> 00:02:56,974
They would call me Nandor

58
00:02:56,999 --> 00:02:58,846
the Relentless.

59
00:03:00,145 --> 00:03:02,100
Because I just never relent.

60
00:03:02,243 --> 00:03:03,947
So I'd like very much for us
to go into there, please.

61
00:03:03,972 --> 00:03:04,742
Just a formality.

62
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:06,375
Come on, please, it's just a formality.

63
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,781
- You could have read it by now.
- Hmm.

64
00:03:07,806 --> 00:03:09,515
Just a formality, okay? Look,
it's not even that far.

65
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,485
- Oh, fuck this, fine.
- Thank you, Laszlo.

66
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:13,730
It's just a formality, please, Nadja.

67
00:03:13,755 --> 00:03:16,239
Just a formality, thank you.

68
00:03:16,264 --> 00:03:18,046
Guillermo, the door.

69
00:03:18,071 --> 00:03:19,868
That wasn't so bad, was it?

70
00:03:19,893 --> 00:03:23,205
Now before we go into the
reading of the letter,

71
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:26,958
I wanted to talk about
general hygiene in the cell.

72
00:03:26,983 --> 00:03:28,008
Last night,

73
00:03:28,033 --> 00:03:30,425
there were all these people down there,

74
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:32,933
shouting and screaming, half-drunk.

75
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:34,508
Where did they find the alcohol?

76
00:03:34,533 --> 00:03:38,052
No, they were half-drunk.
They'd been half drunk.

77
00:03:38,077 --> 00:03:39,917
- Oh.
- Please, finish a whole victim

78
00:03:39,942 --> 00:03:42,267
before moving on to a next one, okay?

79
00:03:42,292 --> 00:03:43,636
It's very unhygienic.

80
00:03:43,661 --> 00:03:45,310
I think I know who's
leaving them down there,

81
00:03:45,335 --> 00:03:48,024
- but I don't want to say.
- If you've got something to say,

82
00:03:48,049 --> 00:03:50,644
- then damn well say it.
- It's not hygienic.

83
00:03:50,669 --> 00:03:52,542
How dare you.

84
00:03:57,597 --> 00:03:59,792
The problems with living
with other vampires

85
00:03:59,817 --> 00:04:01,744
are the vampires I have
chosen to stay with.

86
00:04:03,185 --> 00:04:04,230
Nandor is like

87
00:04:04,255 --> 00:04:07,214
a big turkey just walking around

88
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:09,311
trying to control
everything on the farm.

89
00:04:09,336 --> 00:04:10,394
Hyah!

90
00:04:10,419 --> 00:04:12,421
And Laszlo is my big, crazy,

91
00:04:12,446 --> 00:04:15,441
wild bear and we love to chase
each other around the house.

92
00:04:15,466 --> 00:04:17,894
I ought to fucking kill you!

93
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:20,053
We have a great time together.

94
00:04:21,874 --> 00:04:23,932
I was the most handsome man

95
00:04:23,957 --> 00:04:25,067
in our village.

96
00:04:25,092 --> 00:04:26,722
His village was very badly affected

97
00:04:26,747 --> 00:04:28,644
by leprosy and the plague.

98
00:04:28,849 --> 00:04:30,284
That's true.

99
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:33,082
And I, myself, did contract leprosy,

100
00:04:33,107 --> 00:04:35,128
but I was quite lucky
'cause it couldn't be seen.

101
00:04:35,153 --> 00:04:37,237
It was only one part of my anatomy.

102
00:04:37,262 --> 00:04:38,872
Well, I can see it.

103
00:04:38,897 --> 00:04:41,034
Anyway, one night,

104
00:04:41,059 --> 00:04:43,493
I was awoken by this...

105
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:46,354
horrible clawing at the window.

106
00:04:46,379 --> 00:04:47,902
And I thought, "Who the hell is that?

107
00:04:47,927 --> 00:04:49,917
'Cause I live on the third floor."

108
00:04:49,942 --> 00:04:52,837
So I went to investigate it,
I threw back the curtain...

109
00:04:52,862 --> 00:04:56,463
Well, I saw the most beautiful
woman I had ever seen.

110
00:04:56,488 --> 00:04:59,216
But she was gripping the window

111
00:04:59,241 --> 00:05:00,956
and she was clawing at the glass.

112
00:05:00,981 --> 00:05:02,577
I was hypnotized.

113
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:04,263
I used hypnosis on him.

114
00:05:04,288 --> 00:05:05,849
Which I found out later.

115
00:05:05,874 --> 00:05:08,185
Anyway, obviously I invited her in.

116
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:09,727
We were about to make love

117
00:05:09,752 --> 00:05:13,487
when she turned into this
hideous, leathery bat thing.

118
00:05:13,512 --> 00:05:15,818
She drained me of my blood,

119
00:05:15,843 --> 00:05:18,724
giving me the curse of eternal life

120
00:05:18,749 --> 00:05:20,794
and thus making me a bloodthirsty

121
00:05:20,819 --> 00:05:22,656
creature of the night.

122
00:05:29,075 --> 00:05:31,987
Why don't we just write
on them with marker pen?

123
00:05:32,012 --> 00:05:33,222
Put our names and the date?

124
00:05:33,247 --> 00:05:34,294
Oh, that's a good suggestion.

125
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:35,878
- Yeah.
- Good idea, Nadja.

126
00:05:36,099 --> 00:05:37,519
Marker pens, Guillermo.

127
00:05:37,544 --> 00:05:39,006
Make sure they're permanent.

128
00:05:39,031 --> 00:05:40,389
- Sharpie.
- Genius.

129
00:05:40,414 --> 00:05:43,678
- With date, as well.
- Yes, great thinking, Nadja.

130
00:05:43,703 --> 00:05:47,182
- And yes, this... yes.
- The name of the month, day, year.

131
00:05:47,207 --> 00:05:48,339
Okay.

132
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:50,101
And now we come...

133
00:05:50,126 --> 00:05:52,356
to the reading... of the letter.

134
00:05:52,381 --> 00:05:53,952
At last.

135
00:05:53,977 --> 00:05:55,980
Guillermo? Close the door.

136
00:05:56,396 --> 00:05:59,068
- The door's closed, Master.
- Close it more.

137
00:06:00,301 --> 00:06:01,738
More.

138
00:06:02,977 --> 00:06:04,327
Good.

139
00:06:04,352 --> 00:06:05,847
Now that we are gathered here...

140
00:06:05,872 --> 00:06:08,183
together as one, finally,

141
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:09,808
in accordance with the protocols...

142
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:10,990
Which you made up.

143
00:06:11,015 --> 00:06:12,666
Yes.

144
00:06:13,194 --> 00:06:15,460
We have received this letter.

145
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:19,381
From Baron... Afanas.

146
00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:24,569
Really?

147
00:06:24,594 --> 00:06:25,762
Yes.

148
00:06:27,123 --> 00:06:28,879
How do you...

149
00:06:28,904 --> 00:06:30,516
- Like that.
- Shh.

150
00:06:30,751 --> 00:06:32,353
The Baron...

151
00:06:34,704 --> 00:06:36,701
is coming to visit us.

152
00:06:36,726 --> 00:06:38,120
Holy shit.

153
00:06:38,145 --> 00:06:39,444
Silence, Guillermo.

154
00:06:39,559 --> 00:06:41,039
Vampire comments only.

155
00:06:41,064 --> 00:06:42,587
The Baron never leaves the old country.

156
00:06:42,612 --> 00:06:45,449
Has he told us what the
purposeof his visit is?

157
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:48,096
Uh...

158
00:06:49,405 --> 00:06:50,291
No.

159
00:06:50,316 --> 00:06:51,756
The Baron is a firm believer

160
00:06:51,781 --> 00:06:53,802
that vampires should rule the world.

161
00:06:53,827 --> 00:06:56,834
I think the main purpose
for the Baron's visit

162
00:06:56,985 --> 00:06:58,587
is to find out whether we as vampires

163
00:06:58,612 --> 00:07:00,671
have populated America.

164
00:07:01,275 --> 00:07:02,527
But as you can see,

165
00:07:02,552 --> 00:07:04,299
the place is fucking massive.

166
00:07:04,324 --> 00:07:06,428
When is he coming, exactly?

167
00:07:06,453 --> 00:07:08,012
- Tomorrow.
- Shit.

168
00:07:08,037 --> 00:07:09,421
Why didn't you give this to me earlier?

169
00:07:09,446 --> 00:07:11,143
It arrived this morning, Master.

170
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:14,326
Baron Afanas is...

171
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:17,233
a very charming member
of the vampire royalty.

172
00:07:17,258 --> 00:07:18,311
A few hundred years ago,

173
00:07:18,336 --> 00:07:21,673
we enjoyed a very intense,
very long sexual affair.

174
00:07:21,698 --> 00:07:23,555
It was pretty wild.

175
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,248
Lots of acrobatic stuff.

176
00:07:25,273 --> 00:07:26,863
This could make it awkward,

177
00:07:26,888 --> 00:07:29,451
to see him with Laszlo...

178
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,453
present.

179
00:07:31,478 --> 00:07:33,162
Just between you and I,

180
00:07:33,187 --> 00:07:34,998
a while back, the Baron and I

181
00:07:35,023 --> 00:07:38,250
enjoyed a very intense sex affair.

182
00:07:38,323 --> 00:07:40,170
Very animalistic.

183
00:07:40,195 --> 00:07:42,297
Acrobatic stuff, you might say.

184
00:07:42,322 --> 00:07:43,459
So I, personally,

185
00:07:43,484 --> 00:07:46,467
am very much looking
forward to reconnecting.

186
00:07:46,622 --> 00:07:49,012
We should get a chariot led by

187
00:07:49,037 --> 00:07:51,342
12 black alligators.

188
00:07:51,367 --> 00:07:53,282
- I like that.
- That's a lot of alligators,

189
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:54,767
a lot of paint.

190
00:07:54,792 --> 00:07:56,233
What about a van?

191
00:07:56,258 --> 00:07:58,304
A van?

192
00:07:58,329 --> 00:07:59,370
That's not the same, is it?

193
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:01,397
Can you at least make sure it's black?

194
00:08:01,612 --> 00:08:04,142
Yeah. Black van for tomorrow?

195
00:08:04,167 --> 00:08:07,260
Excellent. Uh, what about
the Baron's bloodlust?

196
00:08:07,285 --> 00:08:09,272
- Virgins.
- Oh, yes, let's do that.

197
00:08:09,297 --> 00:08:11,201
Guillermo, two virgins
by tomorrow evening.

198
00:08:11,226 --> 00:08:12,756
Yes, when the Baron arrives

199
00:08:12,781 --> 00:08:14,870
we shall feast on virgin blood.

200
00:08:22,607 --> 00:08:24,300
Vampire only laughing.

201
00:08:24,325 --> 00:08:26,182
- Should we tell Colin Robinson?
- Laszlo,

202
00:08:26,207 --> 00:08:28,010
that is a terrible idea.

203
00:08:28,035 --> 00:08:29,803
He'll ruin the evening.

204
00:08:30,322 --> 00:08:32,227
Uh, what would ruin the evening?

205
00:08:32,252 --> 00:08:35,265
I told you... didn't
close the door properly.

206
00:08:36,128 --> 00:08:38,270
Are we having a house meeting?

207
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:41,565
- No.
- No.

208
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:44,483
So, your gathering here...

209
00:08:44,508 --> 00:08:46,319
is just a coincidence?

210
00:08:47,071 --> 00:08:48,613
Yes.

211
00:08:49,223 --> 00:08:51,373
My name is Colin Robinson.

212
00:08:51,398 --> 00:08:53,268
And I am what's known as

213
00:08:53,293 --> 00:08:55,446
a psychic vampire.

214
00:08:55,471 --> 00:08:57,211
Or energy vampire.

215
00:08:57,236 --> 00:08:58,998
This is my office.

216
00:08:59,023 --> 00:09:01,684
Also known as the hunting ground.

217
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,017
Hi, Deb.

218
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:05,522
Energy vampires drain people's energy

219
00:09:05,547 --> 00:09:07,627
merely by talking to them.

220
00:09:07,652 --> 00:09:10,331
Actual v. Budget,
year-to-date, no thanks.

221
00:09:10,356 --> 00:09:11,970
You're gonna be at that all day.

222
00:09:11,995 --> 00:09:13,953
We either bore you

223
00:09:13,978 --> 00:09:15,597
with a long conversation...

224
00:09:15,622 --> 00:09:18,143
Feeling better now, I was a
little sick this weekend.

225
00:09:20,295 --> 00:09:21,949
Hey, Don.

226
00:09:21,974 --> 00:09:23,064
Don?

227
00:09:23,089 --> 00:09:25,232
I have to pee, too.

228
00:09:25,257 --> 00:09:26,245
Or...

229
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:27,159
Hey.

230
00:09:27,184 --> 00:09:28,010
We enrage you.

231
00:09:30,326 --> 00:09:33,289
In fact, you probably
know an energy vampire.

232
00:09:33,314 --> 00:09:35,141
We're the most common kind...

233
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:36,785
of vampire.

234
00:09:38,599 --> 00:09:41,504
We are day-walkers, not
affected by the sun.

235
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:46,671
And we are the only kind of vampire

236
00:09:46,696 --> 00:09:49,382
that can drain another vampire's energy.

237
00:09:50,537 --> 00:09:52,634
It's very cool.

238
00:09:54,573 --> 00:09:57,846
The power grows stronger
in him by the night.

239
00:10:04,307 --> 00:10:07,024
There's different kinds of
jobs that I have to do.

240
00:10:07,124 --> 00:10:09,235
Keep the house tidy.

241
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:11,029
Make sure there's no sunlight.

242
00:10:13,604 --> 00:10:15,870
Sunlight! Why, Guillermo,

243
00:10:15,895 --> 00:10:19,909
why?!

244
00:10:20,874 --> 00:10:22,624
Not on my watch.

245
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:25,682
Getting rid of carcasses,

246
00:10:25,707 --> 00:10:28,046
I feel, is a big one.

247
00:10:31,825 --> 00:10:35,508
So, we are under the stairs
and this is my bedroom.

248
00:10:36,407 --> 00:10:39,599
This is a picture of me as Armand

249
00:10:39,624 --> 00:10:41,440
from Interview with the Vampire.

250
00:10:41,465 --> 00:10:43,135
Played by Antonio Banderas.

251
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,688
That was the first time I've ever seen

252
00:10:45,713 --> 00:10:47,377
an Hispanic vampire

253
00:10:47,402 --> 00:10:50,666
in mainstream, like, movies.

254
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:53,607
And I said, "If he can do it, I-I...

255
00:10:53,632 --> 00:10:55,740
I can do it."

256
00:10:55,781 --> 00:10:57,870
Guillermo... boarded
this whole window up,

257
00:10:57,895 --> 00:10:59,494
it's a huge sunlight risk.

258
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,260
We wouldn't want the Baron
waking up to sunlight

259
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:03,197
and being turned into barbecue meat.

260
00:11:03,222 --> 00:11:04,268
Yeah, really cover it.

261
00:11:04,293 --> 00:11:06,709
He's made a lot of
comments recently, like,

262
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:08,961
"I'm going to make you a vampire."

263
00:11:08,986 --> 00:11:11,772
This is a little coffin toy that, uh...

264
00:11:11,797 --> 00:11:13,842
I hope to be in one of these one day.

265
00:11:14,414 --> 00:11:16,416
What ho, good friends.

266
00:11:16,441 --> 00:11:18,262
What ho!

267
00:11:18,287 --> 00:11:21,641
There's still a few
places to find virgins.

268
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:24,434
LARPing stands for Live
Action Role Playing.

269
00:11:24,459 --> 00:11:27,355
In regular life, I'm just Jonathan.

270
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:30,346
But here, I am a very
high-level paladin.

271
00:11:30,371 --> 00:11:31,878
I'm not a killer.

272
00:11:31,903 --> 00:11:34,667
I find people who are easy...

273
00:11:34,692 --> 00:11:37,114
to... kill.

274
00:11:37,139 --> 00:11:38,950
Is that a 14th-century battle-ax?

275
00:11:38,975 --> 00:11:40,315
Oh, it's so exciting.

276
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:42,786
Uh, will we be able to touch the swords?

277
00:11:43,508 --> 00:11:45,372
Oh, you'll touch the swords.

278
00:11:48,062 --> 00:11:49,760
We moved here from Europe

279
00:11:49,785 --> 00:11:52,135
about 200 years ago because there was

280
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,686
a lot of prejudice against
vampires at that time.

281
00:12:00,287 --> 00:12:01,932
They don't like the color of our skin.

282
00:12:02,114 --> 00:12:04,595
Or the fact that we
killed and ate people.

283
00:12:04,983 --> 00:12:06,561
Probably more that.

284
00:12:07,376 --> 00:12:10,398
We're being very careful
not to stand out,

285
00:12:10,423 --> 00:12:12,382
which is why we're both dressed down.

286
00:12:12,612 --> 00:12:15,487
- Uh, good evening.
- Go back to your own country.

287
00:12:15,512 --> 00:12:17,533
What the fuck did you just say?

288
00:12:17,565 --> 00:12:19,010
You heard me, Ghost of
Christmas Past bitch.

289
00:12:19,035 --> 00:12:20,421
Oh, Mike, shut up.

290
00:12:20,446 --> 00:12:24,057
Silence to you. We've
been here since 1861.

291
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,790
At least, our families have.

292
00:12:26,815 --> 00:12:28,415
Begone.

293
00:12:28,869 --> 00:12:31,132
We should just suck their
blood, I'm absolutely starving.

294
00:12:31,157 --> 00:12:32,724
- They're perfect.
- No, I'm furious.

295
00:12:32,749 --> 00:12:34,495
He just insulted me, I'm in fifth gear.

296
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,174
- We should kill them.
- Yes, that's what I'm saying.

297
00:12:36,199 --> 00:12:38,426
- We should suck their blood.
- Yes.

298
00:12:39,781 --> 00:12:41,637
- Now?
- Wait. Wait, darling.

299
00:12:41,662 --> 00:12:43,598
- Now?
- Now!

300
00:12:43,623 --> 00:12:46,260
What?

301
00:12:46,285 --> 00:12:47,784
Mike?

302
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:49,407
Where the fuck are you?

303
00:12:51,582 --> 00:12:53,482
What the fuck?

304
00:12:56,377 --> 00:12:58,640
Yum, yum, yum. He was delicious.

305
00:12:58,665 --> 00:13:00,018
Now, listen, I don't know about you,

306
00:13:00,043 --> 00:13:02,424
but I'm very much in the mood
for some sexual intercourse.

307
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:07,428
Darling. Right next
to the public toilet?

308
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:08,971
Yes. But why don't I get home,

309
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:11,626
get cleaned up, then we can
carry on with our love-making.

310
00:13:11,805 --> 00:13:14,025
Um, I'm going to walk home.

311
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:16,130
Why the hell would you do that?

312
00:13:16,155 --> 00:13:17,471
Why would you walk home?

313
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:19,455
When you could turn into a bat?

314
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:21,385
Bat!

315
00:13:27,147 --> 00:13:28,977
I would like some of that, uh,

316
00:13:29,002 --> 00:13:31,979
colorful dust that sparkles.

317
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:34,064
- Glitter?
- Yes.

318
00:13:34,089 --> 00:13:35,438
Get me some glitter.

319
00:13:35,463 --> 00:13:37,073
Whatever for, Master?

320
00:13:37,098 --> 00:13:38,882
Oh, I want to do something special

321
00:13:38,907 --> 00:13:40,839
for the Immortal One's arrival.

322
00:13:40,864 --> 00:13:43,991
I'm going to sprinkle it
on my face and on my body.

323
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:46,369
Like Twilight.

324
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:50,716
So deliciously macabre.

325
00:13:50,741 --> 00:13:53,657
- Creepy paper.
- It's crepe paper.

326
00:13:53,682 --> 00:13:56,293
- Creepy paper.
- It's crepe paper, Master.

327
00:13:56,318 --> 00:13:59,132
Creepy... Oh, multipack.

328
00:13:59,527 --> 00:14:02,093
Master, this is pretty "macarbre."

329
00:14:07,629 --> 00:14:10,518
Guillermo is my familiar,

330
00:14:10,543 --> 00:14:13,587
but sometimes he's a little
toofamiliar, you know what I mean?

331
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:15,229
I mean, he's always just there.

332
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:16,721
I think it's good, Master.

333
00:14:16,746 --> 00:14:18,338
I mean, he works really hard,

334
00:14:18,363 --> 00:14:19,596
he's just not great at it.

335
00:14:19,621 --> 00:14:21,776
Guillermo, my cape is stuck.

336
00:14:23,436 --> 00:14:24,741
I don't like saying this kind of thing

337
00:14:24,766 --> 00:14:26,284
in front of him, of course.

338
00:14:27,656 --> 00:14:29,033
Sorry, Guillermo.

339
00:14:29,058 --> 00:14:31,627
I don't like saying this kind
of thing in front of you.

340
00:14:31,652 --> 00:14:33,291
That's okay, Master.

341
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,175
Lot of glitter.

342
00:14:42,753 --> 00:14:44,494
- Cash or card?
- Credit.

343
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:46,137
You cannot pay with that.

344
00:14:46,995 --> 00:14:48,530
I'm so sorry.

345
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:50,600
- Did you just throw a coin at me?
- Yes.

346
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:52,769
Sir, you can't be throwing
ancient coins at me.

347
00:14:52,794 --> 00:14:54,722
- Just... Credit card's fine.
- Guillermo, stab this man.

348
00:14:54,747 --> 00:14:56,732
- He's joking.
- Stab him.

349
00:14:56,757 --> 00:14:59,108
- Ahh...
- Thank you.

350
00:14:59,133 --> 00:15:00,499
- I tried, and...
- Here you go, man.

351
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:02,365
- Thank you so much.
- You kind of disobeyed me just now.

352
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:04,697
And I'm noting it.

353
00:15:08,777 --> 00:15:11,830
Recently I have been seeing another man.

354
00:15:14,758 --> 00:15:19,003
He doesn't see me, though,
because I sneak behind him.

355
00:15:24,152 --> 00:15:26,177
I watch him in the night,

356
00:15:26,202 --> 00:15:28,262
in secret.

357
00:15:41,753 --> 00:15:43,780
In the old country, centuries ago,

358
00:15:43,805 --> 00:15:46,215
I was in a very passionate love affair

359
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,490
with a human man called Gregor.

360
00:15:48,664 --> 00:15:50,446
He was a knight.

361
00:15:50,471 --> 00:15:53,161
He got decapitated in battle.

362
00:15:53,186 --> 00:15:55,861
I don't think I ever
really got over Gregor.

363
00:15:55,886 --> 00:15:57,501
Even when I met Laszlo.

364
00:15:57,526 --> 00:15:59,603
June, I've lost my boot.

365
00:15:59,628 --> 00:16:01,546
June?

366
00:16:01,986 --> 00:16:03,540
Come on, June.

367
00:16:03,565 --> 00:16:05,925
The man I saw last night,

368
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:07,468
I think it is him.

369
00:16:07,493 --> 00:16:10,970
I think it is my reincarnated
ex-boyfriend Gregor,

370
00:16:10,995 --> 00:16:12,579
with his head.

371
00:16:12,604 --> 00:16:13,782
Put it on, June.

372
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:15,935
- Shut up, Laszlo!
- Yes, there we are.

373
00:16:16,262 --> 00:16:17,916
Boot on.

374
00:16:20,454 --> 00:16:22,630
Okay, it's just down here somewhere.

375
00:16:22,655 --> 00:16:25,275
Why haven't I been to this
part of the house before?

376
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,738
It's so lovely.

377
00:16:26,763 --> 00:16:28,661
- No one has for 80 years.
- Gorgeous.

378
00:16:28,686 --> 00:16:29,775
What are we doing down here?

379
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,889
There is a chamber, okay?

380
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,878
It's going to be perfect
for the bloodfeast.

381
00:16:33,903 --> 00:16:35,643
If we have the ceremony in here,

382
00:16:35,668 --> 00:16:37,915
then you-know-who won't
even need to know.

383
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:39,768
I mean Colin.

384
00:16:39,793 --> 00:16:42,752
- Colin, what are you doing in here?
- Oh...

385
00:16:42,777 --> 00:16:45,885
This is my bedroom. I'm resting.

386
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,841
You idiot.

387
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:50,324
I didn't know he was gonna be in there.

388
00:16:50,349 --> 00:16:51,853
Why didn't you check?

389
00:16:51,878 --> 00:16:54,536
It's fine, we're gonna have
the ceremony in the attic.

390
00:16:54,561 --> 00:16:56,728
We can't, the StairMaster's in there.

391
00:16:56,753 --> 00:16:58,935
Well, we're going to
move the StairMaster.

392
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:03,356
Is it definitely this boat?

393
00:17:04,243 --> 00:17:05,723
There he is.

394
00:17:05,748 --> 00:17:07,195
I knew he'd have a big box.

395
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:10,092
June, you need to go and fetch him.

396
00:17:13,017 --> 00:17:14,889
Sir, I just need someone to sign for it.

397
00:17:14,914 --> 00:17:18,206
- Where's the pen?
- So, the tablet is the paper.

398
00:17:18,231 --> 00:17:20,374
Your finger is the pen.

399
00:17:20,399 --> 00:17:22,749
Okay, that's weird.

400
00:17:22,774 --> 00:17:24,252
Okay, that's nothing.

401
00:17:24,277 --> 00:17:26,464
Both of you, for some reason,
aren't registering here.

402
00:17:26,489 --> 00:17:28,025
You got long nails maybe or something?

403
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:28,924
Would you like a go, Laszlo?

404
00:17:28,949 --> 00:17:31,095
- Do you have a quill?
- No, it's all digital.

405
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,160
Then I'm not signing that.

406
00:17:32,185 --> 00:17:34,472
Guillermo, give me your hand.

407
00:17:34,821 --> 00:17:37,075
- Ah.
- Okay!

408
00:17:38,392 --> 00:17:40,519
I think the baron might be here

409
00:17:40,544 --> 00:17:42,479
to see me become a vampire.

410
00:17:42,504 --> 00:17:45,464
That would be really cool.

411
00:17:45,489 --> 00:17:48,527
I'm ready.

412
00:17:51,998 --> 00:17:54,366
I should be preparing
for the bloodfeast,

413
00:17:54,391 --> 00:17:57,285
but I can't seem to stay
away from new Gregor.

414
00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:01,372
Man. Human man. Man!

415
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:05,447
- S-Sorry, what did you say?
- Gregor,

416
00:18:05,472 --> 00:18:06,647
it is you.

417
00:18:06,723 --> 00:18:08,564
Oh, my name is Jeff.

418
00:18:08,589 --> 00:18:11,046
- Jeff?
- J-Jeff Suckler.

419
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:14,303
My sweet Greg... Jeff S...

420
00:18:14,328 --> 00:18:16,335
Really... J-Jeff Suckler?

421
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,892
- Yeah.
- Ew.

422
00:18:25,298 --> 00:18:27,482
I call that "Nadja's Theme."

423
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:37,743
Guillermo, are the
virgins arriving soon?

424
00:18:37,768 --> 00:18:40,206
They should be any minute now, Master.

425
00:18:40,231 --> 00:18:41,586
Fingers crossed.

426
00:18:41,611 --> 00:18:42,572
Sorry.

427
00:18:42,597 --> 00:18:44,416
Don't do that.

428
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:49,003
Ah. Dinner is served.

429
00:18:49,316 --> 00:18:50,589
Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum....

430
00:18:51,699 --> 00:18:53,884
Hello. So glad you could make it.

431
00:18:53,909 --> 00:18:55,678
Please come in, quickly.

432
00:18:58,531 --> 00:19:01,350
Everyone, this is Jenna and Jonathan.

433
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:02,685
- Hi.
- Hi.

434
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:03,525
Are you virgins?

435
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:04,372
Mm.

436
00:19:04,397 --> 00:19:05,979
I don't see how that's relevant.

437
00:19:06,004 --> 00:19:07,181
- Mm.
- I'm actually

438
00:19:07,206 --> 00:19:09,149
in a relationship online,

439
00:19:09,174 --> 00:19:11,652
but we've yet to meet IRL.

440
00:19:11,922 --> 00:19:13,862
Well done, Guillermo.

441
00:19:14,176 --> 00:19:15,351
Yeah.

442
00:19:15,376 --> 00:19:16,726
All right, okay, let's do it.

443
00:19:19,736 --> 00:19:21,662
Are they a vampire LARP group?

444
00:19:21,687 --> 00:19:23,556
Yeah, well, why don't we wait in here?

445
00:19:23,581 --> 00:19:25,457
The party's gonna start
in a few minutes,

446
00:19:25,482 --> 00:19:28,118
so we can just hang out, and
I'll come get you when...

447
00:19:30,403 --> 00:19:31,926
No. No, no, no! No, no, no, no.

448
00:19:31,951 --> 00:19:34,040
No, no, no. I said no!

449
00:19:37,662 --> 00:19:40,491
We take our LARPing very seriously.

450
00:19:40,516 --> 00:19:43,978
And that was just an example.
I wanted you to see that.

451
00:19:44,003 --> 00:19:45,852
I'm inspired.

452
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:48,273
So, are you a knight?

453
00:19:48,407 --> 00:19:50,888
Yeah, I'm... Well, no, uh, sorry.

454
00:19:50,913 --> 00:19:53,121
I thought you were gonna
say "night watchman."

455
00:19:53,146 --> 00:19:54,487
I'm a-I'm a night watchman

456
00:19:54,512 --> 00:19:56,113
Mmm.

457
00:19:56,289 --> 00:19:58,639
Protector of the people.

458
00:19:58,664 --> 00:20:00,231
Oh, no, not-not really.

459
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:08,792
Oh, my sweet Gregor-Jeff,

460
00:20:08,817 --> 00:20:12,088
I forgot how much ofa
fantastic raconteur you were.

461
00:20:12,113 --> 00:20:13,439
Oh, yeah.

462
00:20:13,464 --> 00:20:14,639
Oh, yeah, yeah.

463
00:20:14,664 --> 00:20:16,318
Ooh, do you remember that first time

464
00:20:16,343 --> 00:20:18,997
that we made love, and
it was so passionate

465
00:20:19,022 --> 00:20:20,704
that I accidentally cut off your head?

466
00:20:20,729 --> 00:20:22,540
- No. What?
- Mm!

467
00:20:22,565 --> 00:20:25,095
But then I kept going, squeezing

468
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,212
until my needs were met. Hmm.

469
00:20:27,237 --> 00:20:29,065
We should do that again.

470
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:31,744
But I mustn't. But I want to.

471
00:20:31,769 --> 00:20:32,556
But you can't.

472
00:20:32,581 --> 00:20:34,801
But I have been married
for such a long time.

473
00:20:34,826 --> 00:20:37,029
Oh.

474
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:42,636
- I must go.
- Okay.

475
00:20:42,661 --> 00:20:43,728
Let me just get your
number before you go...

476
00:20:44,362 --> 00:20:46,368
so we can... I can...
we can do that again.

477
00:20:46,393 --> 00:20:47,720
Uh...

478
00:20:52,864 --> 00:20:54,518
- You're late.
- Throw it.

479
00:20:54,543 --> 00:20:56,414
That's it.

480
00:20:56,439 --> 00:20:57,758
Okay, Guillermo.

481
00:20:57,935 --> 00:21:02,929
We three... not counting Guillermo...
or June...

482
00:21:04,268 --> 00:21:05,556
or you...

483
00:21:05,581 --> 00:21:08,683
are gathered here in
accordance with the ancient...

484
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:09,704
Get on with it.

485
00:21:09,729 --> 00:21:10,931
- Get on with it.
- Guys.

486
00:21:10,956 --> 00:21:13,040
In bearings with the ordinance-

487
00:21:13,065 --> 00:21:16,112
of the nine generations
that have surpassed us

488
00:21:16,137 --> 00:21:19,154
before this historic
and memorable moment.

489
00:21:20,727 --> 00:21:23,991
Guillermo, open the casket

490
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:27,155
of Baron Afanas.

491
00:21:27,442 --> 00:21:29,580
Oh...

492
00:21:29,605 --> 00:21:31,389
Oh, it opens all by itself.

493
00:21:31,414 --> 00:21:33,416
It's so cool.

00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:51,770
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa...

498
00:21:51,795 --> 00:21:55,191
I say, old chap, that's our familiar.

499
00:22:01,661 --> 00:22:02,879
Good God.

500
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:04,427
Guillermo, did you see?

501
00:22:04,452 --> 00:22:06,388
He ate the familiar.

502
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:10,790
That's scary.

503
00:22:10,815 --> 00:22:13,499
Ne la materia

504
00:22:13,524 --> 00:22:16,064
che mai non dorme

505
00:22:16,089 --> 00:22:20,919
re de le forme.

506
00:22:20,944 --> 00:22:25,877
I have risen again.

507
00:22:26,688 --> 00:22:28,943
Hello, Nadja.

508
00:22:28,968 --> 00:22:30,665
Hello.

509
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:32,644
He's so hilarious.

510
00:22:32,669 --> 00:22:35,105
- Laszlo.
- Yes.

511
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:36,877
I seem to remember him having genitals.

512
00:22:36,902 --> 00:22:39,693
No, never. That is why he
was such a good lover.

513
00:22:39,718 --> 00:22:41,877
Guillermo, fetch the virgins.

514
00:22:42,508 --> 00:22:44,657
As an advocate of the old ways,

515
00:22:44,682 --> 00:22:47,065
can I just apologize
for the crepe paper?

516
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:47,701
Hey...

517
00:22:47,726 --> 00:22:49,728
It should have been
human skin, obviously.

518
00:22:49,753 --> 00:22:52,625
And I deeply apologize
for the StairMaster.

519
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:53,666
It's all his fault.

520
00:22:53,691 --> 00:22:55,560
I go through all this effort,
I get the creepy paper.

521
00:22:55,585 --> 00:22:57,619
- I get Guillermo to...
- It's not "creepy."

522
00:22:57,644 --> 00:22:59,124
It's crepepaper, crepe.

523
00:22:59,149 --> 00:23:01,215
Silence!

524
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:06,886
I come with a proclamation.

525
00:23:07,313 --> 00:23:09,514
The old ways...

526
00:23:09,966 --> 00:23:12,100
are over.

527
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:13,811
Which is what I just said.

528
00:23:13,836 --> 00:23:16,796
The New World, as you call it,

529
00:23:16,821 --> 00:23:18,823
is our lifeline

530
00:23:18,848 --> 00:23:21,862
to an eternal future.

531
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:23,945
Si...

532
00:23:25,154 --> 00:23:27,449
It's a documentary crew.
They're cameras.

533
00:23:27,474 --> 00:23:29,056
It's like they're not even here.

534
00:23:29,081 --> 00:23:30,691
- They are filming me?
- Yes.

535
00:23:30,716 --> 00:23:32,326
Just pretend like they're not there.

536
00:23:32,351 --> 00:23:33,806
It's kind of a natural piece.

537
00:23:33,831 --> 00:23:35,485
You were saying, Baron?

538
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:37,835
Centuries have passed,

539
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:42,089
and you have not
conquered the New World.

540
00:23:42,114 --> 00:23:45,030
You hide in the shadows.

541
00:23:45,055 --> 00:23:47,510
Bah. You are weak.

542
00:23:47,535 --> 00:23:49,414
Oh, God. Oh...

543
00:23:49,439 --> 00:23:51,002
Not now, Guillermo.

544
00:23:51,027 --> 00:23:52,985
Go, go, go. Go, go, go.

545
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:54,353
- Go.
- Oh, by now,

546
00:23:54,378 --> 00:23:57,502
you should rule this, this, uh...

547
00:23:57,527 --> 00:24:00,478
- what is this place again?
- Staten Island.

548
00:24:00,503 --> 00:24:02,942
This Staten Island.

549
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:07,780
Is this Staten Island the seat of power

550
00:24:07,805 --> 00:24:09,574
in the New World?

551
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:12,036
It is where the boat dropped us off.

552
00:24:12,061 --> 00:24:16,765
Down with the old ways.
Up with t-the New World.

553
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:18,505
I've been saying it for
centuries, and he would never

554
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:21,545
- listen...
- Shh.

555
00:24:21,683 --> 00:24:24,590
Mm. I must slumber.

556
00:24:24,615 --> 00:24:26,675
But when I awaken,

557
00:24:26,962 --> 00:24:29,552
we will rule this...

558
00:24:29,577 --> 00:24:31,889
Staten Island.

559
00:24:32,502 --> 00:24:34,599
Y-Yes.

560
00:24:34,624 --> 00:24:35,933
- Yes!
- Yes.

561
00:24:35,958 --> 00:24:36,947
Nadja?

562
00:24:36,972 --> 00:24:39,647
Baron.

563
00:24:39,672 --> 00:24:42,774
- Laszlo.
- Baron.

564
00:24:43,357 --> 00:24:45,694
It's Nandor.

565
00:24:50,823 --> 00:24:51,950
Thank God.

566
00:24:51,975 --> 00:24:54,197
The Baron is furious with us.

567
00:24:54,222 --> 00:24:56,372
It's so dumb that I wore glitter.

568
00:24:56,397 --> 00:24:57,748
Let's get rid of this shit.

569
00:24:57,773 --> 00:24:59,166
If we don't conquer the New World,

570
00:24:59,191 --> 00:25:00,751
he's going to kill us.

571
00:25:00,776 --> 00:25:02,336
Again.

572
00:25:02,867 --> 00:25:06,173
- Basically, we're fucked.
- Fucked.

573
00:25:07,451 --> 00:25:09,410
Well, that was a complete disaster.

574
00:25:09,789 --> 00:25:12,054
At least we have the virgins.

575
00:25:12,608 --> 00:25:15,432
Uh, yes.

576
00:25:19,878 --> 00:25:21,575
For an economy car.

577
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,265
- Oh, great.
- We're too late.

578
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:26,705
Colin Robinson has drained
them of all their energy.

579
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:28,862
"How are you gonna wash this car?"

580
00:25:28,887 --> 00:25:31,674
They have no nutritional value now.

581
00:25:31,699 --> 00:25:33,283
And I know you two said you don't drive,

582
00:25:33,308 --> 00:25:35,180
and don't have driver's licenses,

583
00:25:35,205 --> 00:25:36,494
but are you gonna do a...

584
00:25:36,519 --> 00:25:38,038
a-a different type of car wash,

585
00:25:38,063 --> 00:25:41,124
maybe having detailing done?

586
00:25:41,149 --> 00:25:43,154
Now, detailing, they go into your car

587
00:25:43,179 --> 00:25:45,660
and they get into the
nooks and crannies, so...

588
00:25:45,685 --> 00:25:48,256
Anyway, you take care, okay?

589
00:25:54,412 --> 00:25:56,222
You are glum, Guillermo.

590
00:25:56,593 --> 00:25:58,564
- No.
- Yes.

591
00:25:58,589 --> 00:25:59,981
You think that I've
forgotten that tonight

592
00:26:00,006 --> 00:26:02,938
is a special occasion for
you as well, haven't you?

593
00:26:09,093 --> 00:26:11,863
Does not an anniversary deserve a reward

594
00:26:11,888 --> 00:26:14,574
recognizing your years of service?

595
00:26:16,397 --> 00:26:17,868
I'm ready, Master.

596
00:26:17,902 --> 00:26:19,468
Good.

597
00:26:19,493 --> 00:26:21,428
Prepare yourself.

598
00:26:26,877 --> 00:26:29,505
Happy anniversary, Guillermo.

599
00:26:33,745 --> 00:26:37,264
- Wow...
- It's a glitter portrait.

600
00:26:37,505 --> 00:26:41,434
It's a portrait made from glitter.

601
00:26:41,582 --> 00:26:43,730
Look, it's you.

602
00:26:43,755 --> 00:26:45,981
I made you a vampire.

603
00:26:46,006 --> 00:26:47,573
And look who's next to you.

604
00:26:47,706 --> 00:26:49,055
It's me.

605
00:26:49,099 --> 00:26:51,754
- Wow.
- Enjoy it.

606
00:26:51,779 --> 00:26:54,615
You can put it in your depressing room.

607
00:26:54,916 --> 00:26:58,702
And you deserve it.
Two years of service.

608
00:26:59,434 --> 00:27:00,828
T-Ten.

609
00:27:00,931 --> 00:27:02,759
Ten years of service.

610
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:05,918
- Ten.
- Ten years of service?

611
00:27:08,464 --> 00:27:10,255
Okay.

612
00:27:33,448 --> 00:27:35,823
Night, Guillermo.
