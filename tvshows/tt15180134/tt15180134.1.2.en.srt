1
00:00:10,761 --> 00:00:12,405
Honey, relax.

2
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:15,158
Don't worry.
It's gonna be fine.

3
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:17,660
- This was a bad idea.
- This was a really bad idea.

4
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:18,703
- No.
- We should've told him.

5
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:20,830
And I hate how nervous he makes me.
Do you see me?

6
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:22,332
- I do.
- Well, you're not alone.

7
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:25,043
I mean, everybody has a fucked up
relationship with their parents.

8
00:00:25,067 --> 00:00:26,878
- Yeah.
- Not me. I love my mom.

9
00:00:26,902 --> 00:00:28,713
- She's, like, my best friend.
- See?

10
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:30,632
When I was young and
I didn't win a beauty pageant,

11
00:00:30,656 --> 00:00:33,551
my mom would tell me it was
because my eyes were too close together.

12
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:36,804
As though her marrying her second cousin
had nothing to do with it.

13
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:40,308
And you tell whoever's detailing it,
that if I see swirl marks on it,

14
00:00:40,332 --> 00:00:42,018
I will come kill their family.

15
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,669
Okay. Which car is it?

16
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:44,920
It's the Bentley.

17
00:00:45,504 --> 00:00:46,505
Which spot is it in?

18
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:48,215
The spot with the Bentley.

19
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:51,110
Oh! Hey! Okay.

20
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:53,655
Look at this little, uh, menagerie.
What's happening here?

21
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:57,450
Gordon, obviously we
were all thrown yesterday

22
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:58,785
to find out that Hannah was your daughter,

23
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:01,454
but, you know,
family dynamics, they're so,

24
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:02,872
I don't know, what's the word
I'm looking for? Um...

25
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:05,792
Could you find it
while I'm still young, please?

26
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:08,253
Gordon, we want her to stay
for the good of the show.

27
00:01:08,277 --> 00:01:11,923
Hey... just yesterday,
I asked her to stay,

28
00:01:11,947 --> 00:01:16,052
and she said, quote,
"I'd rather work at Sea World."

29
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:18,263
And then I had to explain to him
why that's an insult.

30
00:01:18,287 --> 00:01:19,973
Who doesn't love
the Dolphin Spectacular?

31
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:21,432
The dolphins.

32
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:23,601
- So, what is it? Now you wanna stay?
- Why? What?

33
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:25,395
I, I wanna do the script that I wrote.

34
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:28,523
Really? 'Cause it felt like you
wanted to shove it up my ass.

35
00:01:28,547 --> 00:01:30,525
No. I...

36
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:31,818
I wanna tell the truth.

37
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:34,404
Okay? Because you based
Lawrence on yourself...

38
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:35,364
- Yes.
- And your new family,

39
00:01:35,388 --> 00:01:38,950
and you left out the old family
that you abandoned.

40
00:01:38,974 --> 00:01:40,785
Didn't abandon. I sent checks.

41
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:41,620
Fuck your money.

42
00:01:41,644 --> 00:01:42,954
Whoa.

43
00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:45,105
Nice. Nice to know you
got your mom's mouth.

44
00:01:45,397 --> 00:01:46,416
This is the magic.

45
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,210
This is how we take
this show to the next level.

46
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:51,921
Gordon, come on.
Lawrence is complicated, now flawed.

47
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:55,592
The, The confrontation
in the last scene alone is mwah!

48
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:59,387
I mean, it's, it's revelatory,
it's profound, it rips your soul out.

49
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:01,139
None, None of that sounds funny.

50
00:02:01,163 --> 00:02:03,016
It's my life, and it wasn't funny.

51
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,002
- Okay... How 'bout you guys?
- You, You seem very quiet.

52
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:11,149
I... I do like there's no kid in it.

53
00:02:11,173 --> 00:02:12,692
I like that I'm not a grandma.

54
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:14,819
That's pretty much
the last stop in Hollywood.

55
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:15,904
Grandmas,

56
00:02:15,928 --> 00:02:17,322
playing a judge on Law & Order,

57
00:02:17,346 --> 00:02:18,073
dead.

58
00:02:18,097 --> 00:02:19,908
All right, so, basically,
that's my choice?

59
00:02:19,932 --> 00:02:21,701
I do your script
or I can go jump in a lake?

60
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:22,994
I mean, I don't care where you jump.

61
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:24,019
If I may...

62
00:02:25,354 --> 00:02:26,563
What's happening now?

63
00:02:27,231 --> 00:02:28,440
Seems to me,

64
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:31,544
Gordon wants one thing,
Hannah wants another.

65
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:32,420
Mm.

66
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:33,444
So,

67
00:02:34,238 --> 00:02:37,449
I'm thinking of something yellow.

68
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:40,929
- Why is he pointing?
- I don't know what this means.

69
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:43,014
- Okay, you know what?
- All right.

70
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:45,725
- We'll read it at the table on Monday, okay?
- Yeah!

71
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:47,310
That's what I'm talkin' about!

72
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:48,478
Come on, guys, let's bring it in.

73
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:49,646
Step Right Up on three.

74
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:50,879
No reason to do that.

75
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:54,341
Come on, guys, just jump right in.

76
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:58,321
All right. One, two, three.
Step Right Up!

77
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:06,246
I never had a grasp of the language.

78
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,330
I've been telling you that for

79
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:09,249
the last 10 minutes.
You just said, "Shh, don't talk to her."

80
00:03:09,273 --> 00:03:10,899
- Hello, actors.
- No, I didn't.

81
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:14,194
- I'm Elaine Kim.
- Hello.

82
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:16,256
I work at Hulu.

83
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,216
- Oh! Oh my goodness, well...
- Oh, hi!

84
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:22,077
- Welcome to our sandbox.
- Let's build some castles.

85
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:24,389
- Ignore him.
- My name is Bree

86
00:03:24,413 --> 00:03:26,540
and I'll send you my sizes
for the Christmas gift.

87
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:31,003
- Honey, I'm kidding.
- Oh, good.

88
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,064
This is my first time on a set.

89
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:34,899
- Oh!
- I'm new to humor.

90
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:37,235
- What do you do?
- Vice President of Comedy.

91
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:39,279
- Mm.
- Fun!

92
00:03:39,303 --> 00:03:42,407
So, where'd we find a gem like you?

93
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:45,702
- Yeah, actually, it is a funny story.
- Oh, okay.

94
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:47,954
I was at Millipede doing
content software integration

95
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:49,247
as they pivoted to video,

96
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:51,332
when Millipede was
acquired by Deedle.

97
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:53,793
So, I migrated
to streaming-data analysis

98
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:56,671
when Fox acquired Deedle,
then Disney acquired Fox

99
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:59,174
and integrated Deedle
system architecture

100
00:03:59,198 --> 00:04:01,509
into all of their streaming platforms.

101
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:03,678
Mm, mm.

102
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:10,417
- Say something.
- You say something.

103
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:19,360
Holy shit, is that your mom?

104
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:20,403
Yeah.

105
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:21,946
What's she doin' here?

106
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,388
Uh, she loves me.

107
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:27,160
Your mom still comes
to set with you every day?

108
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:29,412
Dude, that's creepy.
Cut the cord.

109
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:30,646
It's not creepy.

110
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:36,252
- Oh my god.
- Is that the...

111
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,837
That's not the actress
playing your daughter, is it?

112
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:39,797
- I wouldn't think so.
- Her character description was

113
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:41,257
frazzled, unkempt, and zaftig.

114
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,301
Yeah, no, that's definitely not her.

115
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:45,637
We hired this amazing actress
who looks like a real person,

116
00:04:45,661 --> 00:04:47,680
- not a TV version of what a real person looks like.
- Thank you.

117
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:48,765
- Thank you.
- That sounds right.

118
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:50,642
- So, she's...
- Why is she sitting down?

119
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:52,018
- I don't know.
- Why is she so pretty?

120
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:53,895
- I don't know.
- Well, it'd be super if you could find out, Hannah.

121
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,397
All right, let's, uh,
saddle up, everybody.

122
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:57,732
Let's do this!

123
00:04:57,756 --> 00:04:59,108
Welcome, welcome.

124
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:02,487
You know, as Jesus once said,
"Oy, it's good to be back."

125
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:08,326
Uh, a, uh, warm, great, big,
consensual hug and kiss to everybody,

126
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:12,455
to our original cast:
Bree, and Reed, and Clay,

127
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,333
and Zack, who hopefully
will not, uh, keep comin' up

128
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:17,544
and punchin' me in the schmeckle.

129
00:05:17,568 --> 00:05:21,798
And, uh, how about a special welcome
to the newest member of our cast,

130
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:23,800
playing Reed's daughter, Whitney.

131
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:26,219
How 'bout a hand for Timberly Fox!

132
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:28,847
Yeah!

133
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:34,811
Timberly, uh, made quite a splash
on a, uh, reality dating show called...

134
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:36,479
The name? I'm sorry.
What is the name, honey?

135
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:38,273
Fuck Buddy Mountain.

136
00:05:38,297 --> 00:05:40,150
Fuck Buddy Mountain, yes.

137
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:43,486
And to think Rob and Laura Petrie
had to sleep in twin beds.

138
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,030
And, you know, speaking of daughters,

139
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:49,200
we would not be here without
my own very talented daughter.

140
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:51,643
- Hannah, get up and say a few words.
- Oh.

141
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:55,647
Um, um...

142
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:59,836
Well, there you
go. That's a few words right there.

143
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:03,047
All right! With that, we'll turn
it over to our director, Jerry.

144
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:04,340
Wake up!

145
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,991
Take us away.

146
00:06:07,201 --> 00:06:11,222
- Uh, "Act One, Scene A.
- Interior, Kitchen. Day."

147
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:13,725
"Jake and Cody eat lunch
at the kitchen table.

148
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:15,685
Josie enters, exhausted."

149
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:17,604
"Hey, Mom. How was hot yoga?"

150
00:06:17,628 --> 00:06:19,981
- "I haven't gone yet."
- I was just outside getting the mail.

151
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:21,941
"This is just the effects
of global warming."

152
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:25,445
"Can I ask you something?

153
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:27,864
Have you noticed Lawrence acting strange?"

154
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:30,950
- "Now that you mention it, yes.
- For the last 25 years."

155
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:33,143
"Okay."

156
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:40,108
"What do you want me to say?
I did what I did and I'm not perfect."

157
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:42,629
"Who asked you to be perfect?

158
00:06:42,653 --> 00:06:46,049
"None of my fathers...
None of my friends' fathers were perfect.

159
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:49,302
"They were dorky,
they wore socks with sandals,

160
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:52,764
"they made dumb jokes in the car
when they drove us to school,

161
00:06:52,788 --> 00:06:55,517
"but they were there.

162
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:58,168
Like I wanted you to be."

163
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:04,067
"Wh-When you say it like that,

164
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:07,403
how am I not supposed
to be moved?"

165
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,428
"Look,

166
00:07:09,555 --> 00:07:12,975
"we're not gonna be able
to wrap this in a neat little bow.

167
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:15,328
Real life doesn't work that way."

168
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:17,580
"Lawrence sighs,
lost in a hurricane of regret."

169
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:19,958
"Music cue:
St. Vincent's 'Birth in Reverse.'

170
00:07:19,982 --> 00:07:23,586
As the camera slowly pulls back,
we fade to black, and that's our show."

171
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,588
Okay, there you go. Nice job.

172
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:28,758
All right! See you all at the Emmys!

173
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:30,301
- Timberly.
- Yeah?

174
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:31,511
- That was great.
- Thank you.

175
00:07:31,535 --> 00:07:33,555
- It made me cry.
- This is gonna be so much fun.

176
00:07:33,579 --> 00:07:34,639
Oh my gosh, are you kidding me?

177
00:07:34,663 --> 00:07:36,432
- Yeah, yeah.
- You're really pretty.

178
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,456
Thanks, you too.

179
00:07:38,876 --> 00:07:40,270
What the fuck was that?

180
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:41,938
Maybe the greatest thing I've ever seen.

181
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:45,150
- Oh, oh, congratulations.
- The pretty girl tanked.

182
00:07:45,174 --> 00:07:48,027
Maybe think about the show for one second.

183
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:50,655
She just ruined my big emotional scene.

184
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:52,407
Wow, watching you
and Timberly together

185
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:54,826
is like watching two
world class ice dancers,

186
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:56,953
trying to act for the first time.

187
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:58,496
This, This, This cannot be happening.

188
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,624
- Oh, calm down.
- There's no way they're not firing her.

189
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:04,919
- I don't know.
- The Hulu execs seem to like her.

190
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:07,755
Maybe it's 'cause her eyes
are so far apart.

191
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:09,591
They're not that far apart.

192
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:15,805
Hey! What the hell happened?

193
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:18,308
- Hulu didn't approve your girl.
- They wanted this one.

194
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:21,102
My girl is an actual trained
Broadway actress.

195
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:23,563
She's not some contestant
on Fuck Buddy Mountain.

196
00:08:23,587 --> 00:08:25,047
I understand.

197
00:08:25,923 --> 00:08:27,525
My hands are tied.

198
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:30,612
You know, stunt casting,
it's an age-old tradition in Hollywood.

199
00:08:30,636 --> 00:08:32,530
When I did Benson,
I was writing on Benson,

200
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:36,326
they made us cast
Mary Lou Retton as a U.S. Senator.

201
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:37,869
- What's that?
- Okay, but you could've at least

202
00:08:37,893 --> 00:08:38,995
told me this was happening.

203
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:42,540
- I did. I wrote you an email.
- I sent you and you never responded.

204
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:44,959
- No, you never sent me an email.
- I never sent you... Really?

205
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:46,693
Okay, Smarty Pants, what does that say?

206
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:49,714
I'm a professional writer.

207
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:51,799
You really think this is
still my email address?

208
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:52,800
It's not?

209
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:55,345
HannahBananaSparklePony87?

210
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:57,180
- It could be.
- @aol.com?

211
00:08:57,204 --> 00:08:58,681
- What's wrong with AOL?
- Just take this.

212
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:00,016
- So, what do we do?
- What do we do now?

213
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,768
So, now we get to work.

214
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:03,978
Get to... Ah, I see.

215
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:06,105
So, the pretty girl
fucks up the table read,

216
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:07,982
and this is your excuse
for hacking into my script.

217
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:09,025
- I...
- Yeah.

218
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,735
- It wasn't great.
- No, she wasn't great!

219
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:12,153
All right, so, we'll help her out.

220
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:14,739
We'll, We'll lighten the tone,
give her some physical business.

221
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:18,284
Like... Like, not...
Obviously, not this, but, bad example,

222
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:20,829
a bunch of popcorn flies out of the dryer.

223
00:09:20,853 --> 00:09:22,997
Like that. Something.

224
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:25,792
- How did I come from you?
- Relax! We'll fix it.

225
00:09:25,816 --> 00:09:29,778
We don't shoot 'til Friday.
It's only Monday!

226
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:33,883
So, there we were in Gordon's office,

227
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:36,177
determining the fate of the show,

228
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:37,637
and everyone looked to me.

229
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:39,264
Wow, that sounds intense.

230
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:41,850
It actually reminded me of the ending
of my film Pint Sized Pilot.

231
00:09:41,874 --> 00:09:43,768
I'll set it up.
So, the plane's going down,

232
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:45,228
and my co-pilot's missing
'cause someone threw

233
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:46,771
a tennis ball down the aisle.

234
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:48,523
Wait, did I mention he was
a German Shepherd?

235
00:09:48,547 --> 00:09:51,401
- Honey, you've had enough sweets.
- Mom!

236
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:53,486
I don't have chicken
and dumplings in the crock pot

237
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,530
just so you can bounce
off the walls all night.

238
00:09:55,554 --> 00:09:56,805
Have some carrots.

239
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:02,829
- I'll see you.
- Definitely.

240
00:10:02,853 --> 00:10:04,453
Good luck handing out those call sheets.

241
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:08,459
Woo-hoo. Getting cock-blocked
by Mommy, that's rough.

242
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:11,379
Dude, stop. She's been coming
to set with me my whole life.

243
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:13,506
- When you were a kid.
- How old are you?

244
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,341
Twenty-four and three-quarters.

245
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:19,053
- Just say 24 and act like it.
- Tell her to go knit somewhere else.

246
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:20,495
It's complicated.

247
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:23,540
Ever since her and my dad split,
I'm all she's got.

248
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:25,876
I can't hurt her feelings.

249
00:10:31,882 --> 00:10:33,693
Could you say something to my mom?

250
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:35,528
- Me?
- Yeah, tell her it's weird for you guys,

251
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:36,489
so that it doesn't come from me.

252
00:10:36,513 --> 00:10:39,139
Wait, so I'm the one who
has to hurt her feelings?

253
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:42,141
Yeah, what the fuck.

254
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:50,126
- Ooh, Hannah!
- Quick question about the new H scene.

255
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,378
- Uh, sure.
- Wait, what new H scene?

256
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:54,464
- "Josie opens the dryer.
- Instead of clothes,

257
00:10:54,488 --> 00:10:56,633
an avalanche of hot popcorn spills out."

258
00:10:56,657 --> 00:10:58,384
- Very funny.
- No, it's not.

259
00:10:58,408 --> 00:10:59,409
Yeah, I agree.

260
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:01,846
Wait, how did this happen?

261
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:04,224
I think Jake and Cody stashed
some microwave popcorn in there?

262
00:11:04,248 --> 00:11:07,310
- That's not... Okay.
- So, yeah, this bit is cut.

263
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:10,897
- We have run-through in a half hour.
- Uh, maybe I should talk to Gordon.

264
00:11:10,921 --> 00:11:12,941
Nope, no need
'cause this is also my show,

265
00:11:12,965 --> 00:11:14,567
so the popcorn bit is cut.

266
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:16,969
Thank you.

267
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:22,784
"Wow... So, I guess
this is your happy family.

268
00:11:22,808 --> 00:11:24,744
You guys are really
into cargo shorts, huh?"

269
00:11:24,768 --> 00:11:25,912
"We like big pockets."

270
00:11:25,936 --> 00:11:27,789
"Got a lotta baggage to carry around?

271
00:11:27,813 --> 00:11:28,790
Whitney exits."

272
00:11:28,814 --> 00:11:30,023
And we're out.

273
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:32,544
Ah, okay.

274
00:11:32,568 --> 00:11:33,878
- Timberly, sweetheart?
- Yeah?

275
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:34,902
You're

276
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:37,382
still reading the stage directions.

277
00:11:37,406 --> 00:11:39,050
- See where it says, "Whitney exits?"
- Yeah?

278
00:11:39,074 --> 00:11:40,301
- You're Whitney.
- Yeah.

279
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:41,262
- Exit.
- Sorry.

280
00:11:41,286 --> 00:11:42,470
- No, no, it's okay.
- Yes, yes.

281
00:11:42,494 --> 00:11:43,930
- Thank you.
- Can we get her a special script?

282
00:11:43,954 --> 00:11:46,790
That takes us to Scene H
in the laundry room!

283
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:51,146
Um... please, let me replace her.

284
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:53,898
Our research shows we need
a young, attractive woman

285
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:56,317
to reach the 18-to 34-year-old
male demographic.

286
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:58,778
But she is a terrible actress.

287
00:11:58,802 --> 00:12:01,573
Our research shows that that
has no effect whatsoever.

288
00:12:01,597 --> 00:12:04,742
Well, if you need her so bad,
then what does your research say about me?

289
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:07,245
Oh, don't worry,
you're extremely popular

290
00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:10,707
with sassy seniors and coupon fanatics.

291
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:13,358
- Bree, we're ready for you.
- No.

292
00:12:14,318 --> 00:12:15,503
- But, um...
- "This is unreal!

293
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:17,922
I just cannot believe
you have a daughter!"

294
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:21,259
- "Well, look on the bright side."
- Cody has an older sister.

295
00:12:21,283 --> 00:12:23,094
"Now we have someone
to babysit our adult son

296
00:12:23,118 --> 00:12:25,221
on Saturday nights."

297
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:27,581
"Forgive me if I don't
feel like laughing."

298
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:32,353
- What happened to my popcorn?
- Hannah said it was cut.

299
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:33,980
No. But I don't need to
take it out while we're rehearsing.

300
00:12:34,004 --> 00:12:36,149
I understand, Bree.
There's no reason to get excited.

301
00:12:36,173 --> 00:12:37,525
I'm not excited.

302
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:44,640
Come in!

303
00:12:45,724 --> 00:12:49,329
Well! Look what the cat dragged in.

304
00:12:49,353 --> 00:12:50,289
Zack's not here.

305
00:12:50,313 --> 00:12:52,665
- Actually, I came to see you.
- Here's the thing.

306
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:55,043
Zack's not a kid anymore,
and it's kinda fucked up...

307
00:12:55,067 --> 00:12:57,277
- Ooh! Language.
- We don't say that.

308
00:12:58,529 --> 00:13:01,949
- Messed up you're here, you know?
- Comin' in to work with him every day?

309
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:05,094
Oh... I see.

310
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:08,121
Well... I didn't mean to embarrass him.

311
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:11,559
I just kinda feel like
this business is scary

312
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:14,586
and a boy could use all the love
and protection he can get.

313
00:13:15,754 --> 00:13:17,148
Didn't your mother do that for you?

314
00:13:17,172 --> 00:13:19,692
My mom mostly did all
the drugs she could get.

315
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:21,969
Oh... poor thing.

316
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:29,893
Wait, you've got a... little something
on your sweet, little cheek.

317
00:13:32,354 --> 00:13:36,316
Get it off... Yeah...
Oop, one more spot.

318
00:13:39,903 --> 00:13:42,090
So what, we're just cutting bits
without telling me now?

319
00:13:42,114 --> 00:13:44,717
Well, I sent you an email,
you just never responded.

320
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:48,137
- Nice callback.
- Popcorn in a dryer, really?

321
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:52,058
- That would've worked.
- No. It's... way too broad.

322
00:13:52,082 --> 00:13:54,978
And you didn't even tell me about it.
I'm the co-show runner.

323
00:13:55,002 --> 00:13:57,021
- Do you remember that?
- 'Kay, when are you gonna realize,

324
00:13:57,045 --> 00:13:58,815
I've been doin' this
a little longer than you.

325
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:00,400
I know what I'm talkin' about.

326
00:14:00,424 --> 00:14:01,442
Case in point.

327
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:02,527
That song you wanted,

328
00:14:02,551 --> 00:14:05,238
that St. Margaret's,
whatever the hell it's called,

329
00:14:05,262 --> 00:14:07,490
$80,000 for a song.

330
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:09,993
Here. Here's a list
of public domain songs.

331
00:14:10,017 --> 00:14:11,411
Pick somethin' you like.

332
00:14:11,435 --> 00:14:12,745
"She'll Be Coming Round the Mountain."

333
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:15,415
I actually like "Camptown Races,"
but author's choice.

334
00:14:15,439 --> 00:14:17,292
Hannah, we need to talk.

335
00:14:17,316 --> 00:14:18,459
- Oh, fuck, okay.
- I...

336
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:19,878
Listen, listen, that's Reed

337
00:14:19,902 --> 00:14:21,296
and he's super fuckin'
pissed about Timberly,

338
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,422
so you deal with this.

339
00:14:22,446 --> 00:14:25,341
- What, a pissed off actor?
- It's easy. They're like children.

340
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:28,011
You jingle some shiny keys
and you promise 'em a cookie

341
00:14:28,035 --> 00:14:29,012
and they stop crying.

342
00:14:29,036 --> 00:14:31,181
That is so condescending.

343
00:14:31,205 --> 00:14:33,308
He's an artist. He has integrity.

344
00:14:33,332 --> 00:14:35,209
Yes, but he wants a cookie.

345
00:14:35,876 --> 00:14:36,876
Trust me.

346
00:14:37,169 --> 00:14:40,380
- Hi, hi.
- Hannah, we have gotta stop Gordon from...

347
00:14:40,923 --> 00:14:45,028
- Oh... Hello.
- Reed, I'm so glad they found ya.

348
00:14:45,052 --> 00:14:46,154
Thanks for gettin' here so fast.

349
00:14:46,178 --> 00:14:46,947
What?

350
00:14:46,971 --> 00:14:48,323
No one... I came to you.

351
00:14:48,347 --> 00:14:51,367
Yeah, we sent a PA to get you
'cause we gotta talk about Timberly.

352
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:54,662
- It's obvious we got a problem here.
- Oh, yeah. Definitely.

353
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:56,748
She cannot play the material.

354
00:14:56,772 --> 00:14:59,709
- She is ruining your words.
- You don't have to convince me, man.

355
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:01,669
I think it's obvious what has to happen?

356
00:15:01,693 --> 00:15:04,881
- Oh, finally.
- Yeah, you need to teach her how to act.

357
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:06,925
- I... What?
- Listen, you can get her there.

358
00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:09,177
You practically give
an acting class every day.

359
00:15:09,201 --> 00:15:10,428
Well, I mean, you know, I'm doing...

360
00:15:10,452 --> 00:15:12,388
And Jerry doesn't have your instincts.

361
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:14,599
Well, I mean, he's pretty good
at movin' the cameras around,

362
00:15:14,623 --> 00:15:17,060
- but that's about it.
- Yeah, but you, you move people.

363
00:15:17,084 --> 00:15:20,355
You... Remember how green
Bree was back in the day, huh?

364
00:15:20,379 --> 00:15:22,941
I mean, she couldn't even
internalize her primary intentions.

365
00:15:22,965 --> 00:15:27,195
But then you, ya did your magic
and you, you molded her into a star.

366
00:15:27,219 --> 00:15:29,113
You saved the whole show,

367
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:30,556
so I'm askin' you,

368
00:15:31,056 --> 00:15:32,575
you, you gotta do it again.

369
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:34,828
- Gordon.
- Uh, Reed. Hey, Reed.

370
00:15:34,852 --> 00:15:37,092
- You, You, You...
- You know what? He's right.

371
00:15:37,563 --> 00:15:38,772
I'm the only one.

372
00:15:44,696 --> 00:15:46,029
Jingle-jingle.

373
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:54,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

374
00:15:55,038 --> 00:15:58,876
- Ooh, hey, uh, have you seen Timberly?
- They need me to save the show.

375
00:15:59,585 --> 00:16:02,546
- I'm sorry, what? No.
- But what-what's with you?

376
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:07,443
Zack asked me to talk to his mom about
not coming around anymore, so I did.

377
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:08,736
Okay, good. That's good.

378
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,989
G-Good for you
'cause that-that's weird, you know?

379
00:16:11,013 --> 00:16:13,807
- How'd she take it?
- Pretty well. She blew me.

380
00:16:14,683 --> 00:16:15,883
I'm sorry, she-she blew you?

381
00:16:16,894 --> 00:16:19,247
- Are you serious?
- A hundred percent.

382
00:16:19,271 --> 00:16:21,583
- Oh god, that's so fucked up.
- I know!

383
00:16:21,607 --> 00:16:24,127
And after I finished,
she told me I was a "good boy" and...

384
00:16:24,151 --> 00:16:25,712
- What?
- Gave me orange slices.

385
00:16:25,736 --> 00:16:29,257
- Oh!
- It was nurturing and depraved all at the same time.

386
00:16:29,281 --> 00:16:31,634
- Well, okay.
- That, That can never happen again.

387
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:33,285
I know! You're right.

388
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:36,806
- Why exactly?
- 'Cause what if Zack finds out?

389
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,683
- Finds what out?
- Son of a...

390
00:16:38,707 --> 00:16:41,394
Uh, that I couldn't talk
to your mom yet.

391
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:43,021
- Too hard, huh?
- No.

392
00:16:43,045 --> 00:16:45,148
- No, I wouldn't say that.
- Not that, uh.

393
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:47,901
She was just busy doing
something else, but I will.

394
00:16:47,925 --> 00:16:50,612
- Awesome! You're the best.
- Ooh! Orange slices.

395
00:16:50,636 --> 00:16:52,614
No, no, no... But don't.

396
00:16:56,183 --> 00:16:58,286
"They made dumb jokes in the car
when they drove us to school,

397
00:16:58,310 --> 00:16:59,830
"but they were there.

398
00:17:00,103 --> 00:17:01,313
Like I wanted you to be."

399
00:17:02,147 --> 00:17:03,208
- That's wonderful.
- Okay.

400
00:17:03,232 --> 00:17:05,376
So, deep down, you're devastated
and you're spiraling.

401
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,337
- I feel it...
- Okay.

402
00:17:06,361 --> 00:17:10,572
But... what if you want him
to think you're in control?

403
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:13,176
- Let's stand it up.
- Okay.

404
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,826
- Okay?
- Yeah.

405
00:17:18,372 --> 00:17:20,099
What do you want me to say?

406
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:21,893
I-I did what I did.

407
00:17:21,917 --> 00:17:23,126
I'm not perfect.

408
00:17:26,004 --> 00:17:27,631
Who asked you to be perfect?

409
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:30,276
None of my friends' fathers were perfect.

410
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:33,613
'Cause they were dorky,
they wore socks with sandals,

411
00:17:33,637 --> 00:17:35,824
they made dumb jokes in the car
when they drove us to school,

412
00:17:35,848 --> 00:17:37,307
but they were there.

413
00:17:38,642 --> 00:17:40,060
Like I wanted you to be.

414
00:17:44,356 --> 00:17:47,693
The duckling has become the swan.

415
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:51,172
- Great job.
- She's really getting good.

416
00:17:51,196 --> 00:17:53,174
Can I help you with something, Kelly?

417
00:17:53,198 --> 00:17:55,468
Yeah, stop by the hair trailer
when you get a chance

418
00:17:55,492 --> 00:17:57,494
and let's touch up those grays.

419
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:07,921
Hi! Hi.

420
00:18:09,131 --> 00:18:10,525
You guys talkin' about Step Right Up?

421
00:18:10,549 --> 00:18:13,236
Oh, no, we were talking,
uh, Fuck Buddy Mountain.

422
00:18:14,511 --> 00:18:16,889
Well, did you hear we're coming back?

423
00:18:18,265 --> 00:18:22,996
Ooh, guys, it's this awesome sitcom
that was on, like, forever ago...

424
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,820
- Not that long ago.
- And I'm gonna be on it.

425
00:18:25,856 --> 00:18:27,417
Oh, and Bree plays my mom.

426
00:18:27,441 --> 00:18:29,210
- Stepmom.
- Yeah.

427
00:18:29,234 --> 00:18:30,879
- Stepmom.
- Timberly, tell my boyfriend Craig...

428
00:18:30,903 --> 00:18:31,714
- Yeah.
- He's a piece of shit.

429
00:18:31,738 --> 00:18:33,089
- Sure.
- Oh, fun.

430
00:18:33,113 --> 00:18:35,008
Hey, Craig! You're a piece of shit!

431
00:18:37,117 --> 00:18:39,220
- I love you, Timberly.
- Oh my god. Love you guys, too.

432
00:18:39,244 --> 00:18:41,181
- Thank you.
- Take care. Have a good tour!

433
00:18:41,205 --> 00:18:44,267
Well, she is fantastic.

434
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:47,353
Close stage... Bye! Bye.

435
00:18:47,377 --> 00:18:48,897
But today, it's Glenn Closed.

436
00:18:49,922 --> 00:18:52,275
- Aww.
- I love that. Love them.

437
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:55,236
- Hey, I'm so, so glad I caught you, um.
- Yeah.

438
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:58,972
- I just wanted to tell you that...
- I know what you're going through.

439
00:18:59,765 --> 00:19:00,909
With Reed.

440
00:19:00,933 --> 00:19:01,869
What do you mean?

441
00:19:01,893 --> 00:19:05,163
- Oh, with all the acting notes.
- Isn't it driving you crazy?

442
00:19:05,187 --> 00:19:07,606
I mean, I love the guy,
but he can be a lot.

443
00:19:08,398 --> 00:19:09,876
I mean, he's been so nice to me.

444
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,003
- Oh, no, he is the nicest, for sure.
- Right.

445
00:19:12,027 --> 00:19:14,172
And it's just that, like,

446
00:19:14,196 --> 00:19:15,590
he did this with me on my first show,

447
00:19:15,614 --> 00:19:18,676
and then I went out there
and I did everything he told me to do,

448
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,327
- like exactly.
- Right.

449
00:19:21,203 --> 00:19:22,829
And it was a disaster.

450
00:19:23,622 --> 00:19:25,433
- Really?
- He's old fashioned.

451
00:19:25,457 --> 00:19:27,376
- Yeah.
- It almost ended my career.

452
00:19:28,293 --> 00:19:29,395
Really?

453
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:31,606
- Between us girls...
- Yeah.

454
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:33,316
I'll tell you what you need to know.

455
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:37,987
So, where do we go from here?

456
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:39,221
I don't know.

457
00:19:39,805 --> 00:19:42,575
Part of me wants to hug you,

458
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:44,601
and part of me wants to scream!

459
00:19:45,102 --> 00:19:46,937
I've never done this before.

460
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,107
Um, well,

461
00:19:51,275 --> 00:19:54,528
I'm pullin' for the hug,
but I might not have a vote here.

462
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:59,867
Well... I guess we'll just
have to play it by ear.

463
00:20:10,169 --> 00:20:12,188
Oh, hey, you're back.

464
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:14,732
Uh, I have something for you,
but, but I'm kind of scared.

465
00:20:14,756 --> 00:20:15,859
Why?

466
00:20:15,883 --> 00:20:17,068
Well, I think it's
'cause I'm from Malibu

467
00:20:17,092 --> 00:20:17,987
and nothing bad happens there.

468
00:20:18,011 --> 00:20:19,654
Oh, don't. What is it, Connor?

469
00:20:19,678 --> 00:20:21,990
Just new pages from the last scene.

470
00:20:22,014 --> 00:20:23,432
New...

471
00:20:26,602 --> 00:20:28,454
Are you fucking kidding me?
We shoot in half an hour.

472
00:20:28,478 --> 00:20:30,981
- Okay. Whoa.
- That is exactly what Reed said.

473
00:20:31,398 --> 00:20:33,168
I can't believe this.

474
00:20:46,121 --> 00:20:48,141
Hey! Come on in.

475
00:20:48,165 --> 00:20:50,083
I'm just makin' some treats
in the toaster oven.

476
00:20:51,335 --> 00:20:54,505
Yeah, I was thinkin' maybe
we should talk outside.

477
00:20:55,714 --> 00:20:58,133
Oh... I see.

478
00:21:00,928 --> 00:21:03,156
You changed the last scene
without telling me.

479
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:04,657
- I couldn't find you.
- Oh, let me guess.

480
00:21:04,681 --> 00:21:06,784
You tried to reach me
on my Easy Bake Oven.

481
00:21:06,808 --> 00:21:08,995
- Yeah, very funny.
- Where'd you disappear to?

482
00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:10,646
To my shrink, okay?

483
00:21:11,271 --> 00:21:12,624
And then I went to Shake Shack

484
00:21:12,648 --> 00:21:15,627
because no professional can cure
this relationship in 50 minutes.

485
00:21:15,651 --> 00:21:17,712
All right, well, listen,
you saw her at run-through,

486
00:21:17,736 --> 00:21:19,839
she was yelling and with the hands.

487
00:21:19,863 --> 00:21:23,218
She can't pull off the, the heavy stuff,
so I lightened it up a bit.

488
00:21:23,242 --> 00:21:24,511
A bit? A bit?

489
00:21:24,535 --> 00:21:26,429
Lawrence now doesn't even
know he has a daughter.

490
00:21:26,453 --> 00:21:28,598
She just shows up at the end
and everyone's thrilled.

491
00:21:28,622 --> 00:21:30,850
- Yeah, trust me. It's better.
- It's better.

492
00:21:30,874 --> 00:21:33,478
Oh, also, you added back in
the dryer popcorn bit?

493
00:21:33,502 --> 00:21:36,397
- You weren't here. It's Friday.
- I did what I had to do.

494
00:21:36,421 --> 00:21:38,691
You did what you had to do,
so you wouldn't look like an asshole.

495
00:21:38,715 --> 00:21:40,944
Because if Lawrence looks like an asshole,
that means you're an asshole

496
00:21:40,968 --> 00:21:44,489
and you can't be the asshole,
even though, let's be clear,

497
00:21:44,513 --> 00:21:45,931
you're an asshole.

498
00:21:46,807 --> 00:21:49,226
- How was therapy today?
- Pretty, Pretty productive for you?

499
00:21:50,894 --> 00:21:53,540
You know you've never apologized
once for disappearing.

500
00:21:53,564 --> 00:21:54,564
I...

501
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,775
- You know what, honey?
- Don't "honey" me.

502
00:21:57,734 --> 00:21:59,361
This is my story.

503
00:21:59,862 --> 00:22:02,006
Okay? This is my life.
You can't rewrite it.

504
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:04,884
And you know what? This is my show!

505
00:22:04,908 --> 00:22:08,638
And you're trying to hijack it,
so you can rip me apart.

506
00:22:08,662 --> 00:22:09,872
I'm not gonna be the villain.

507
00:22:10,706 --> 00:22:11,707
Too late.

508
00:22:19,047 --> 00:22:22,694
Yeah! Awesome, fantastic.

509
00:22:22,718 --> 00:22:25,363
Oh, wow, are you two married?

510
00:22:25,387 --> 00:22:28,116
This is what I call
a May-December romance.

511
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:30,827
And by that, I mean,
it may be over by December.

512
00:22:32,853 --> 00:22:34,664
These don't write themselves, people.

513
00:22:37,649 --> 00:22:40,670
- Thank you.
- Hey.

514
00:22:40,694 --> 00:22:43,322
Bree got into Timberly's head
and completely messed her up.

515
00:22:44,323 --> 00:22:46,366
You think that's bad,
I just fucked Zack's mom.

516
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:49,971
Jesus... I told you to end that.

517
00:22:49,995 --> 00:22:52,348
I know, but she smelled
like snickerdoodles.

518
00:22:52,372 --> 00:22:54,601
- What the...
- Oh god. What's wrong with me?

519
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:57,437
Well, for one, you clearly
have mother issues.

520
00:22:57,461 --> 00:22:58,980
No way.

521
00:22:59,004 --> 00:23:00,398
Although, once when I was a kid,

522
00:23:00,422 --> 00:23:03,610
I did call a phone sex hotline
and my mom answered.

523
00:23:03,634 --> 00:23:04,635
What?

524
00:23:05,427 --> 00:23:06,845
But that can't be it.

525
00:23:09,348 --> 00:23:11,767
I know it was you.

526
00:23:12,476 --> 00:23:15,788
You sabotaged Timberly...
and they gutted my big scene.

527
00:23:15,812 --> 00:23:17,790
I don't know what you're talking about.

528
00:23:17,814 --> 00:23:20,025
She told me it was you.

529
00:23:21,151 --> 00:23:23,570
That wasn't very supportive
of her, was it?

530
00:23:25,531 --> 00:23:27,884
- Why would you undermine her like that?
- She's not your competition.

531
00:23:27,908 --> 00:23:30,345
This isn't
one of your stupid, beauty pageants.

532
00:23:30,369 --> 00:23:32,805
Oh, wake up. Hollywood is way worse.

533
00:23:32,829 --> 00:23:36,476
When I was doing my first-ever guest spot
on Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman,

534
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:39,562
Jane Seymour tried to crush me
by loosening the wheel to my loom.

535
00:23:39,586 --> 00:23:42,190
And on my last show,
my "gal pal" co-star,

536
00:23:42,214 --> 00:23:44,734
she was so jealous of me
that she fucked the show runner

537
00:23:44,758 --> 00:23:47,487
and had him turn me into a space insect!

538
00:23:47,511 --> 00:23:50,156
Well, congratulations.

539
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:52,659
'Cause now Timberly has a story about you.

540
00:23:52,683 --> 00:23:57,521
As Lawrence, Reed Sterling!

541
00:23:58,981 --> 00:24:04,796
As Josie, Bree Marie Jensen!

542
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:07,239
Hi!

543
00:24:09,032 --> 00:24:11,928
Everybody give one
huge round of applause

544
00:24:11,952 --> 00:24:15,831
for your Step Right Up cast!

545
00:24:17,457 --> 00:24:19,519
See why it's so hard for me
to say anything to my mom?

546
00:24:19,543 --> 00:24:21,378
Look at her. She's glowing.

547
00:24:33,015 --> 00:24:34,742
Hey, Mom, how was hot yoga?

548
00:24:34,766 --> 00:24:35,767
Too hot.

549
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:38,950
I haven't sweat that much since
you said you were quitting college.

550
00:24:40,606 --> 00:24:42,024
Can I ask you something?

551
00:24:42,649 --> 00:24:44,752
Have you noticed Lawrence acting strange?

552
00:24:44,776 --> 00:24:47,463
- Now that you mention it, yeah.
- For the last 25 years.

553
00:24:55,704 --> 00:24:56,997
- Hey.
- Hi.

554
00:24:58,332 --> 00:25:00,751
- You all right?
- Yeah, sorry.

555
00:25:02,336 --> 00:25:04,105
I'm just really nervous.

556
00:25:05,255 --> 00:25:07,317
I mean, I'm not an actor
like you guys,

557
00:25:07,341 --> 00:25:09,486
so all the changes and the notes.

558
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:11,613
I just feel like I don't know
what I'm doing.

559
00:25:11,637 --> 00:25:12,947
- Oh.
- And I mean,

560
00:25:12,971 --> 00:25:15,408
Reed is telling me to do everything
from the inside, right?

561
00:25:15,432 --> 00:25:18,161
And... But you're saying to do
all these things on the outside?

562
00:25:18,185 --> 00:25:22,040
- Timberly.
- I just feel like I am letting everyone down,

563
00:25:22,064 --> 00:25:24,066
after you guys have been so nice to me.

564
00:25:28,237 --> 00:25:30,239
- Do me a favor, okay?
- Yeah.

565
00:25:30,948 --> 00:25:32,950
Just forget what I said.

566
00:25:33,784 --> 00:25:35,386
I was being stupid.

567
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:37,889
I was screwing you up
and you were doing so great.

568
00:25:37,913 --> 00:25:41,434
I, I just... I don't know
what I'm talking about.

569
00:25:41,458 --> 00:25:46,880
I haven't acted in 15 years.
I have been so terrified this week.

570
00:25:49,258 --> 00:25:54,447
There is a reason why everyone who
walks past you on this lot loves you.

571
00:25:54,471 --> 00:25:56,449
Okay, honey?

572
00:25:56,473 --> 00:25:57,409
'Kay.

573
00:25:57,433 --> 00:25:59,202
So, listen to Reed

574
00:26:00,394 --> 00:26:02,539
And you're gonna be amazing.

575
00:26:02,563 --> 00:26:03,730
Thank you.

576
00:26:04,439 --> 00:26:07,860
- Come here.
- We women have to stick together.

577
00:26:08,527 --> 00:26:11,506
- Jane Seymour taught me that.
- Who?

578
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:13,341
Are you ready for the final scene?

579
00:26:13,365 --> 00:26:16,761
Okay, I'm gonna
need a lot of energy for the final scene.

580
00:26:16,785 --> 00:26:18,203
How are you doing?

581
00:26:19,705 --> 00:26:22,105
All I can say is you're lucky
you don't work with your dad.

582
00:26:23,083 --> 00:26:24,811
God, that's his dream.

583
00:26:24,835 --> 00:26:26,771
He's a software engineer at Microsoft.

584
00:26:26,795 --> 00:26:30,400
He made sure I got a Masters
in Computer Science from Stanford,

585
00:26:30,424 --> 00:26:33,820
yet... here I am on the set
of Step Right Up.

586
00:26:35,721 --> 00:26:37,973
- He thinks I'm crazy.
- Oh, he's right.

587
00:26:39,016 --> 00:26:42,620
I mean, we're both crazy
for being here, truly.

588
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:49,043
Mm, when I was a kid,
my parents worked all the time

589
00:26:49,067 --> 00:26:51,796
and I was usually home alone,

590
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:54,465
studying and watching
TV shows about families

591
00:26:54,489 --> 00:26:56,408
that always seemed happier than mine.

592
00:26:57,784 --> 00:26:59,661
Guess which one was my favorite?

593
00:27:00,495 --> 00:27:03,332
Oh, am I about to lose
all respect for you?

594
00:27:04,666 --> 00:27:07,937
I've probably seen every episode,
five times?

595
00:27:07,961 --> 00:27:10,231
- What?
- Yeah.

596
00:27:10,255 --> 00:27:13,133
I had a huge crush on Cody.

597
00:27:13,926 --> 00:27:16,470
I used to pause the show
and kiss him through the screen.

598
00:27:18,263 --> 00:27:21,058
- Forget I said that.
- Um, I, I will try to.

599
00:27:21,808 --> 00:27:26,206
- Hey, Shake Shack.
- New pages... for the last scene.

600
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:27,707
- What? New pages?
- Thank you.

601
00:27:27,731 --> 00:27:29,501
How can he make this any worse?

602
00:27:29,525 --> 00:27:32,736
Well, if it makes you feel any better,
Reed said the pages are pretty tight.

603
00:27:37,074 --> 00:27:38,283
Is everything all right?

604
00:27:39,993 --> 00:27:43,997
I guess I'm just upset with myself
for not looking you up sooner.

605
00:27:44,373 --> 00:27:45,374
Don't be.

606
00:27:46,375 --> 00:27:48,377
If anything, be upset with me.

607
00:27:48,919 --> 00:27:49,919
For what?

608
00:27:50,587 --> 00:27:51,588
I knew about you.

609
00:27:54,132 --> 00:27:56,134
I pretended I didn't, but I did.

610
00:27:56,635 --> 00:28:00,264
I was young, I was scared,
and that's no excuse.

611
00:28:01,807 --> 00:28:02,808
I'm the dad.

612
00:28:03,433 --> 00:28:05,060
I should've been there.

613
00:28:05,394 --> 00:28:06,812
I should've been a mensch.

614
00:28:07,271 --> 00:28:09,958
I made all sorts of excuses for myself.

615
00:28:09,982 --> 00:28:14,194
Your mom hating me,
assuming you would, too.

616
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:21,159
And if I could go back...
and change things, I would.

617
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,161
But I can't.

618
00:28:25,622 --> 00:28:28,125
But... I'm hoping,

619
00:28:28,959 --> 00:28:30,961
someday, when you're ready,

620
00:28:32,671 --> 00:28:33,911
you'll give me a second chance.

621
00:28:40,721 --> 00:28:44,349
For god's sake, you two hug.

622
00:28:57,237 --> 00:29:00,133
Um, hey.

623
00:29:00,157 --> 00:29:03,303
- Oh! Hey, hey, hey.
- Hey, hey, uh, you're, you're leaving already?

624
00:29:03,327 --> 00:29:05,346
Yeah, I taped
the Clippers game so I just...

625
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:07,664
I wanna get out of there before
anybody tells me who won.

626
00:29:08,749 --> 00:29:09,749
Um,

627
00:29:11,168 --> 00:29:12,937
thank you for that, the scene.

628
00:29:12,961 --> 00:29:15,857
Oh yeah. I thought that
worked pretty good, right?

629
00:29:15,881 --> 00:29:16,858
Yeah.

630
00:29:16,882 --> 00:29:20,361
Sorry, you probably wanted me
to have him say a little bit more to her,

631
00:29:20,385 --> 00:29:24,014
but... characters can't change
that much in one episode.

632
00:29:25,182 --> 00:29:26,350
Takes a little time.

633
00:29:27,017 --> 00:29:28,369
All right, see you Monday, yeah?

634
00:29:28,393 --> 00:29:29,770
- Yeah. Looks like it.
- Okay.

635
00:29:30,437 --> 00:29:32,439
- Oh, um,
- I'm sorry, too.

636
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:34,399
What are you sorry for?

637
00:29:41,615 --> 00:29:44,010
You're right. It's too broad.

637
00:29:45,305 --> 00:30:45,776
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
