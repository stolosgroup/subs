1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,437
Oh, shit.

3
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:29,589
Clay! Dougie Lewis.

4
00:00:29,613 --> 00:00:32,007
We used to have the same agent
back in the day.

5
00:00:32,031 --> 00:00:34,093
Oh, yeah. Hey, Dougie, how you doin'?

6
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:35,178
Well, not great, you know?

7
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:37,931
Things have been a little...
rough, to be honest.

8
00:00:37,955 --> 00:00:40,475
You know, I haven't booked a job
since I posted that manifesto,

9
00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:43,627
and a Ford Fusion is no place to live, so.

10
00:00:44,253 --> 00:00:45,230
- Yeah.
- I can't believe they let you back

11
00:00:45,254 --> 00:00:47,357
on the lot after all that
trouble you used to cause.

12
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:50,443
Ah, yeah, I had to sign
a crazy strict morals clause.

13
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:51,486
- Speaking of which...
- Hey, you know what?

14
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,488
I'm actually here auditioning
for a couple lines

15
00:00:53,512 --> 00:00:55,281
on Chicago Hope: Miami.

16
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:57,283
I don't know if you know
anybody over there...

17
00:00:57,307 --> 00:01:00,995
- Oh, I really don't. I'm, uh...
- That's why I got this suit, you know?

18
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:02,747
The guy at the garage sale
wanted 40 bucks.

19
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:05,583
- I said, "I can't afford that."
- Hey, Dougie, look.

20
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:06,960
I'm sorry your life sucks,

21
00:01:06,984 --> 00:01:08,711
but I fucked someone
I wasn't supposed to,

22
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:11,214
so I have to get to wardrobe right now.

23
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:12,715
Okay. Roger that.

24
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,575
- Yeah.
- Break a leg.

25
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:16,409
- So.
- Oh!

26
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:18,829
You and my mom, doin' the deed.

27
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:22,725
Okay, if you need to hit me, go ahead.

28
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:25,895
Just don't break my nose,
my septum's hanging on by a thread.

29
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,689
I'm not gonna hit you.

30
00:01:27,713 --> 00:01:31,985
I just wanna know, man to man,
do you like my mom?

31
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:33,719
Or do you like-like my mom?

32
00:01:34,553 --> 00:01:36,072
I like-like what we did,

33
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:39,284
but I don't feel comfortable
talking to you about any of this.

34
00:01:39,308 --> 00:01:41,602
Cool... Cool.

35
00:01:42,895 --> 00:01:44,122
I was just worried

36
00:01:44,146 --> 00:01:46,833
'cause if it was one of those
"wham bam thank you, Mom" situations,

37
00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:48,668
she does not handle that well.

38
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:49,669
What do you mean?

39
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:51,546
She was dating this guy
and he was using her,

40
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:54,716
and she kinda smashed his windshield,
and the neighbors had to call the police.

41
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:57,719
- Whoa! No, no, no.
- None of that here. No, no.

42
00:01:57,743 --> 00:01:58,785
Awesome!

43
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:03,707
My real mom and my TV dad dating.
Uh, dreams come true much?

44
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:21,075
- Good morning.
- Morning, morning, morning.

45
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:25,788
All right, let's get...
Oh, hello, people I don't know.

46
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:28,333
- Hi, Gordon. Gordon, uh...
- Everyone, this is Gordon.

47
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:30,752
He is the creator of the original show.

48
00:02:30,776 --> 00:02:33,421
Also, technically, my father.
Uh, Gordon, new writers.

49
00:02:33,445 --> 00:02:35,507
Oh! Okay. Ah, good for us.

50
00:02:35,531 --> 00:02:39,219
This one of those...
diversity intern training things?

51
00:02:39,243 --> 00:02:40,553
- Uh...
- You know what?

52
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:42,972
Personally, I think it's a shame
you're not getting paid

53
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,266
'cause that's not right at all,
but I will say this,

54
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:48,085
the lessons you're
gonna learn, invaluable.

55
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:49,312
Case in point:

56
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:51,648
Misunderstandings, always funny.

57
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:54,526
Example, guy's in a store
and he's talking to a busty salesgirl...

58
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:55,402
Okay, stop!

59
00:02:55,426 --> 00:02:56,945
No, Gordon, these are the writers

60
00:02:56,969 --> 00:03:00,657
that I hired for the show
before you decided to

61
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:02,116
- join us. Yeah.
- Oh.

62
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,077
Janae comes from the Harvard Lampoon,

63
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:06,329
Benny is an amazing queer playwright,

64
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:09,123
and Azmina wrote an amazing spec script,

65
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:11,417
and fine, is also
from the Disney diversity program.

66
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:12,752
What, no Eskimos?

67
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:13,878
Oh my god.

68
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:14,797
Wow.

69
00:03:14,821 --> 00:03:16,089
Literal gasp.

70
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:17,423
Uh-oh. What? Did I just step in it?

71
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:19,843
Is... Is one of you part Eskimo?

72
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:22,595
- No, that's not the problem.
- All right, good, good.

73
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:24,848
Hey, little fun fact.

74
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:29,585
I happen to be Eskimo brothers
with Don Johnson.

75
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:37,944
Hey.

76
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:40,488
- Uh, did you read the rewrite?
- No, not yet.

77
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:41,489
Yeah, they added a scene.

78
00:03:41,513 --> 00:03:42,949
- Uh, we're in bed.
- Oh.

79
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:44,367
- Foolin' around.
- Ooh.

80
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:47,662
That's actually kind of racy compared to
how tame we had to keep it on network.

81
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:50,039
I just, just wanted to
make sure you're okay with it?

82
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,624
Yeah, why wouldn't I be?

83
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:54,878
Oh, uh, well, you know,
just, um... given our history.

84
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:56,111
Mmm.

85
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:58,256
You think that your mouth is a wormhole

86
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,383
and I'm gonna fall right back into 2005?

87
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:03,052
- No, no! What?
- No, no, no, no, no.

88
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,471
- Yeah, you do. I think you do.
- Oh, I don't, I don't. I'm tellin'...

89
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:07,098
No, this is fine, this is great.

90
00:04:07,122 --> 00:04:08,641
- Okay.
- This is great, Bree.

91
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:12,228
You're fine, I'm fine, uh.

92
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,939
Just worried about... oh, you know.

93
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:15,964
What?

94
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:18,526
You're going through
a divorce right now.

95
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:19,445
Oh.

96
00:04:19,469 --> 00:04:21,988
You might be feeling
a little bit lonely and vulnerable,

97
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:26,534
which could, you know,
lead to stirrings of old feelings.

98
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:28,203
You are being
so condescending right now...

99
00:04:28,227 --> 00:04:31,522
- No, no, honey, I'm not being condescending.
- Yeah, you're doing it right now.

100
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:35,192
- Bree, I am not being...
- Still doing it.

101
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:37,819
Still doing it.

102
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:41,990
Lana!

103
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:48,765
I just walked into my trailer to find
a full assortment of Spanx waiting for me.

104
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:50,308
Are you trying to tell me something?

105
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:51,768
I don't know what you're talkin' about.

106
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:54,378
Oh, well, I guess I just got visited
by the Spanx fairy then.

107
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:56,856
Sweetie, it's Hollywood.

108
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,109
There's not an actress over 40
raw doggin' it these days.

109
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:03,321
- Charming.
- Just be careful wearing them on a date.

110
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:04,531
When a man undresses you,

111
00:05:04,555 --> 00:05:07,575
you expand like one
of those mattresses in a box.

112
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:10,036
Well, I haven't had to worry
about that in a while.

113
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:13,122
- Why? Oh, sorry.
- Couldn't help but overhear.

114
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:16,066
Because I haven't been
on a first date in 15 years.

115
00:05:16,692 --> 00:05:18,545
That's since I was six years old.

116
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:20,964
Why is everyone trying to hurt me today?

117
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:22,382
Okay, look, we gotta fix this,

118
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:26,135
take you out,
help you meet some hot zaddies.

119
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,470
What are you doing tomorrow night?

120
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:30,163
I can't, I am so behind on Cupcake Wars.

121
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,892
I just heard myself.
Where do you wanna go?

122
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:35,478
Let's get some dinner
and then go someplace fun.

123
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:36,980
What do you wanna eat: Sushi or Mexican?

124
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:39,482
- Mexican.
- I'd go for sushi.

125
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:42,759
- Fuck off, Lana!
- Ooh, somebody's hangry.

126
00:05:46,597 --> 00:05:48,015
- Shorter?
- Yeah.

127
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,666
- There's my guy.
- Oh god.

128
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,418
Got a hot little tip for ya.

129
00:05:58,442 --> 00:06:00,587
You know that special lady
you've been crushin' on?

130
00:06:00,611 --> 00:06:03,381
- You mean, your mom?
- It's her birthday Saturday.

131
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:06,676
I scored us a res at the O-G,
Olive Garden.

132
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,595
Let's just say if you were
to show up at the table

133
00:06:08,619 --> 00:06:11,055
with the never-ending bread sticks,
she would not be mad.

134
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:13,933
- Oh, hell yes.
- As long as it's not Saturday, I'm in.

135
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:15,959
Oh, I just said it was Saturday.

136
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:18,962
Oh, what about brunch on Sunday?

137
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:25,028
We need to find a way
to bring Whitney and Josie closer.

138
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:29,824
- Okay. What if...
- there's a, a hot delivery guy

139
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:33,244
and both girls are ordering
all this stuff they don't even want

140
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:34,537
just so they can see the guy.

141
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:37,248
And then on the way out,
there's, like, a big box,

142
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:39,292
he trips over the box

143
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:43,296
'cause hot plus clumsy, always funny.

144
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,422
- Right?
- Yeah, so, in real life,

145
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:46,883
people don't just
magically trip over things

146
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:48,676
the exact moment you need them to.

147
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,178
They can if you write that.

148
00:06:50,202 --> 00:06:51,804
I wanna do something less sitcom-y,

149
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:55,099
or, you know, at least something
that passes the Bechdel test.

150
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:56,768
What?

151
00:06:56,792 --> 00:07:00,021
Something that passes the Bechdel test.

152
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:03,799
- No, I heard her...
- I just don't know what the fuck that is.

153
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:06,778
- Guys, let's go easy on him.
- He's old.

154
00:07:06,802 --> 00:07:08,571
I heard that, too, Carrot Top.

155
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:10,515
Or Carrot Bottom,
I don't wanna make assumptions.

156
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:12,158
To pass the Bechdel test,

157
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:14,786
the script must have at least
one exchange between two women

158
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:16,728
where they're not talking about a man.

159
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:19,648
- Is she still talkin'?
- 'Cause I dozed off.

160
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:22,877
This is probably too meta,
but...

161
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:23,920
Oh my god.

162
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:26,381
This is exciting,
she's got somethin' here.

163
00:07:26,405 --> 00:07:30,593
What if they bond by talking
about Alison Bechdel?

164
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:33,096
That's hilarious.

165
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,558
- Oh, I like that.
- All right, I, I also get why it's funny.

166
00:07:36,582 --> 00:07:38,309
Um, can I speak to you
for a second outside?

167
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:39,585
Yeah.

168
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:41,628
What's the problem?

169
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:45,108
I was under the impression
we're still makin' a comedy.

170
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:48,987
Oh my god, just because they're
not pitching, like, old-timey jokes

171
00:07:49,011 --> 00:07:52,282
- doesn't m...
- No, no, no. They're not pitching jokes period.

172
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:54,784
So, comedy's evolved since
you last wrote for television.

173
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,661
I mean, honestly,
whole species have evolved.

174
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:58,705
Listen, we don't schlep in
a live audience every week

175
00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:01,666
so they can sit there and nod
in thoughtful amusement.

176
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:03,376
We need them to actually laugh.

177
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,254
Yeah, I get it, and trust me,
these writers are very funny.

178
00:08:06,278 --> 00:08:07,881
I...

179
00:08:07,905 --> 00:08:09,340
The bathroom is that way?

180
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:12,677
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, A-Azmina.

181
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:14,053
Funniest food?

182
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:17,706
Uh, I don't know. Uh, oatmeal.

183
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:22,187
Oatmeal... Aren't you embarrassed?

184
00:08:22,211 --> 00:08:23,855
It's pickles.

185
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,088
Pickles?

186
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:30,928
Okay. Let's get this on its feet.

187
00:08:31,303 --> 00:08:33,072
Or maybe I should say on its back.

188
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:35,950
Jake, you're in the hall.

189
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:38,227
Lawrence is on top of Josie.

190
00:08:38,727 --> 00:08:40,580
- I'm on top of her, huh?
- Uh-huh, yeah.

191
00:08:40,604 --> 00:08:42,582
Oh, okay. Umm.

192
00:08:42,606 --> 00:08:45,335
All right, so... so we'll
mock the kissing.

193
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:47,170
Oh my god,
I'm gonna punch you in the face.

194
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:49,422
And action!

195
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:50,447
All right, wow.

196
00:08:50,948 --> 00:08:52,926
Looks like we have
the house all to ourselves.

197
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,302
- Mm.
- And you're kissing.

198
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:56,513
- Kiss, kiss. Kiss, kiss.
- Kiss, kiss. Kiss, kiss.

199
00:08:56,537 --> 00:08:59,349
Now the canoodling's
getting hot and heavy.

200
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:00,642
All right.

201
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:04,646
Very nice. Humpy, humpy... Very nice.

202
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:08,608
- Um.
- Okay, what is that?

203
00:09:08,632 --> 00:09:10,902
- Nothing, it's nothing.
- Doesn't feel like nothing.

204
00:09:10,926 --> 00:09:13,655
Don't mind me, just lookin' for my keys.

205
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:14,906
Jake!

206
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:17,951
Ah, ah, ah, I think it's funnier
if you stay on top of her.

207
00:09:17,975 --> 00:09:20,119
- You want me to stay on top of her?
- Yeah.

208
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:21,143
Oh.

209
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:24,165
- Oh boy.
- But... there's, you know,

210
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:25,750
in terms of the momentum of the scene...

211
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:28,503
- Jer, I think Reed wants to get off now.
- Not, Not what I said.

212
00:09:28,527 --> 00:09:31,256
Okay, fine, Lawrence
gets out of the bed.

213
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:35,969
- Uh, uh, or, or, uh, here's a thought.
- Lawrence stays in bed.

214
00:09:35,993 --> 00:09:37,470
You don't wanna get outta bed?

215
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:38,805
I really don't.

216
00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:40,682
Jerry, is it funny if
I pull off the covers...

217
00:09:40,706 --> 00:09:42,600
No, no, no, nope. Nope, not funny.

218
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:45,395
Oh, I get it.

219
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:47,063
It's no big deal, everyone,

220
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:49,149
- Reed just has an erection.
- Yep!

221
00:09:49,173 --> 00:09:50,775
Let's take five

222
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:52,777
on account of Reed's erection.

223
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:55,613
Hey, uh, Jerry, is this
a hard five or a soft five?

224
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:57,615
Unbelievable.

225
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:00,767
That's... Really, Really, Jerry?
You don't laugh in 56 years. That got you?

226
00:10:08,859 --> 00:10:12,088
Right, so, uh, where did
we leave off yesterday?

227
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:15,049
Gordon pitched that Caitlyn Jenner joke
and then you threw an orange at him.

228
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:17,552
- It was a tangelo.
- Yeah, that's the important part.

229
00:10:17,576 --> 00:10:19,804
Okay, right. I mean, uh, before that.

230
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:23,683
Uh, we talked about the fight
you and your dad had in the kitchen.

231
00:10:23,707 --> 00:10:26,144
And a lot of other fights
you two have had.

232
00:10:26,168 --> 00:10:29,272
And then we watched
an episode of Yellow jackets.

233
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:33,276
I will admit I was
a bit... thrown yesterday,

234
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,277
but, today, we are...

235
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:35,237
Good news, everyone.

236
00:10:35,261 --> 00:10:37,697
The comedy cavalry has arrived.

237
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:40,867
Good morning! Delivery from Jews 'R' Us.

238
00:10:40,891 --> 00:10:43,912
Sorry we're late, we've been wandering
in Palm Desert for 40 years.

239
00:10:43,936 --> 00:10:45,205
Ignore these old fucks.

240
00:10:45,229 --> 00:10:46,498
They saw some actress out there

241
00:10:46,522 --> 00:10:48,708
and they got their first
hard-ons in 20 years.

242
00:10:48,732 --> 00:10:50,627
Let me introduce everybody.

243
00:10:50,651 --> 00:10:53,004
This is Alan, Bob, Selma.

244
00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:55,948
Say hello to Benny, Janae, and Azmina.

245
00:10:56,406 --> 00:10:59,219
- Azmina...
- I think I take that for my gout.

246
00:10:59,243 --> 00:11:02,305
Azmina, that's a Spanish name,
if I'm not mistaken.

247
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:04,516
- Sorta.
- My first wife was Latin.

248
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:06,935
Case you ever wonder
why I'm scared of you.

249
00:11:09,253 --> 00:11:10,730
Uh, kitchen?

250
00:11:10,754 --> 00:11:12,589
All righty.

251
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:16,152
They're exactly what we need.

252
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:18,321
Oh, well, then I'm shocked they were
available at a moment's notice.

253
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:20,156
Did you find them
feeding birds in the park?

254
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,241
They're funny.

255
00:11:21,265 --> 00:11:23,117
Every single one of those writers

256
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:25,745
has been making sitcoms
since before you were born.

257
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:27,622
That's not a point in their favor.

258
00:11:27,646 --> 00:11:30,083
We don't need a bunch of dinosaurs
in the writers' room.

259
00:11:30,107 --> 00:11:31,001
So funny you say that,

260
00:11:31,025 --> 00:11:33,586
Alan ran the last two seasons
of Dinosaurs on ABC.

261
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:37,173
Yeah, again, "wrote for giant puppets"
is not the mic drop you think it is.

262
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:40,134
Trust me, when it's late
and we're tired,

263
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:42,679
and we're stuck on that
last page of a rewrite,

264
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:44,222
you are gonna want pros like them.

265
00:11:44,246 --> 00:11:46,891
They can come up with a joke
that gets ya home every time.

266
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:47,892
They're legends.

267
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,877
And they're hipper than you think.

268
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:53,064
- Hey.
- Nice kids,

269
00:11:53,088 --> 00:11:56,717
but Selma had this great cunt joke,
went over like a fart in schule.

270
00:11:57,426 --> 00:11:59,553
Also, uh, where can I find a fax machine?

271
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:04,742
- Oh, hold up.
- We gotta meet the Queen Bree.

272
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:07,537
Queen Bree Marie Jensen,
and she's single.

273
00:12:07,561 --> 00:12:10,081
Can we, um, can we just tape this later

274
00:12:10,105 --> 00:12:11,833
because, honestly,
I'm feeling really gross right now,

275
00:12:11,857 --> 00:12:12,710
and according to wardrobe,

276
00:12:12,734 --> 00:12:14,460
I look like a cow
if I'm not wearing Spanx.

277
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:16,486
We're live to 85,000 people.

278
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:19,465
- Oh, hi, everyone!
- Hey, yeah.

279
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:20,758
Hello!

280
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:23,344
You should show them the bird
that lives in the light grid!

281
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:25,096
Good call!

282
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,955
How hilarious is she?

283
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:30,250
Hey, Bree... Uh, Reed, a moment.

284
00:12:31,335 --> 00:12:36,065
I just came from a bullshit meeting at HR
about what happened yesterday.

285
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:37,108
What happened yesterday?

286
00:12:37,132 --> 00:12:39,277
Sweetheart, you got a hard-on.

287
00:12:39,301 --> 00:12:41,404
Apparently, that's against company policy.

288
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:43,156
Oh my god, there was a meeting?

289
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:45,200
Oh my god, this is
the greatest thing ever.

290
00:12:45,224 --> 00:12:48,602
I'm supposed to make you
feel comfortable because,

291
00:12:50,646 --> 00:12:53,082
"The Walt Disney company
is committed to providing

292
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:56,127
"a safe and secure workplace environment.

293
00:12:56,151 --> 00:12:59,088
"We must all work together
for a better tomorrow.

294
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:01,591
Walt Disney, where dreams come true."

295
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:03,343
- All right, great...
- Just to be clear,

296
00:13:03,367 --> 00:13:07,263
Jerry, um, I'm not in trouble for being
so hot that Reed got an erection?

297
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:08,723
This is on Reed for being a dog

298
00:13:08,747 --> 00:13:10,683
who goes full lipstick
if someone touches him, right?

299
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:12,685
No, this is about Reed.

300
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:14,604
None of the executives made fun of you.

301
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:18,608
Okay, the only reason this happened
is because I was reacting in character,

302
00:13:18,632 --> 00:13:21,486
as Lawrence, who was
being aroused by his wife, Josie.

303
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:22,904
No, I don't think that's what it is.

304
00:13:22,928 --> 00:13:25,657
What I think happened is that
you're confused because of our history

305
00:13:25,681 --> 00:13:27,033
and I think you still
have feelings for me.

306
00:13:27,057 --> 00:13:31,663
- I do not still have feelings for you.
- I am in a committed relationship.

307
00:13:31,687 --> 00:13:35,542
Right, with Nora,
who's a real person in New York City.

308
00:13:35,566 --> 00:13:37,293
- Okay, you know what?
- Thank you so very much, Jerry,

309
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:39,921
for bringin' this to my attention
and reading this document.

310
00:13:39,945 --> 00:13:41,381
I have had enough.

311
00:13:41,405 --> 00:13:44,008
Oh, no, there's, there's somethin' else.

312
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:46,928
Uh, Dennis, where's
the thing and the thing?

313
00:13:46,952 --> 00:13:49,138
- Here you go.
- Wh-What are we doin' now?

314
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:51,808
This is called a vajoga.

315
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:53,184
God.

316
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:57,272
I'm thrilled to announce you place it
between your stuff and her business

317
00:13:57,296 --> 00:13:59,399
as a protective barrier.

318
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:05,071
Um, Jerry, I don't think you are aware
of just how hard Reed was yesterday.

319
00:14:05,095 --> 00:14:07,198
I don't think that's
gonna be enough protection.

320
00:14:07,222 --> 00:14:08,075
Please kill me.

321
00:14:08,099 --> 00:14:10,326
There's also this modesty sock.

322
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,536
Tell me more.

323
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:15,206
Well, you lace it around your member

324
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:18,859
and pull on the strap
until you achieve a snug fit.

325
00:14:20,903 --> 00:14:23,173
This is fun.

326
00:14:23,197 --> 00:14:25,592
Well, I won't need a vajoga,
and I won't need a sock

327
00:14:25,616 --> 00:14:28,660
because after today,
I may never get hard again.

328
00:14:38,921 --> 00:14:40,773
Hey, naughty man.

329
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:42,442
I knit you a scarf.

330
00:14:42,466 --> 00:14:44,444
You wanna try it on for size?

331
00:14:44,468 --> 00:14:48,364
- Oh, I, I don't know.
- I... wouldn't want you to get cold.

332
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:50,617
Don't worry, I run hot.

333
00:14:50,641 --> 00:14:52,994
Especially since I hit my 50s.

334
00:14:53,018 --> 00:14:58,750
Oh, wow, you know, I, uh,
just came to grab my, uh...

335
00:14:58,774 --> 00:15:00,210
They need me on stage, so.

336
00:15:00,234 --> 00:15:03,713
Ooh, are you tryin' to run away,
my little bunny?

337
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:06,841
'Cause that would make
Mommy so upset with you.

338
00:15:06,865 --> 00:15:09,093
- No, no, no, no.
- No need to get upset.

339
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:10,386
Nobody's trying to run away.

340
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:13,431
I just, I-literally, have
to get back to the stage

341
00:15:13,455 --> 00:15:14,308
to do my scene.

342
00:15:14,332 --> 00:15:16,601
Oh, what if we shot a little scene?

343
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:21,481
"Interior me, Clay enters."

344
00:15:21,505 --> 00:15:25,360
Oh, boy, I would really love that, uh,

345
00:15:25,384 --> 00:15:30,222
but they're callin' me,
so, uh... Clay has to exit.

346
00:15:36,895 --> 00:15:40,291
Reed! Hey!
Can I hide in your trailer?

347
00:15:40,315 --> 00:15:41,960
Is this Zack's mom again?

348
00:15:41,984 --> 00:15:44,212
Yeah, he found out,
but he's not even pissed at me,

349
00:15:44,236 --> 00:15:47,549
and now that everyone's okay with it,
uch, it just feels wrong.

350
00:15:47,573 --> 00:15:49,884
So break it off with her.

351
00:15:49,908 --> 00:15:53,596
Well... Zack told me she busted
out some dude's windshield

352
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:57,225
for trying to cut and run,
and I can't afford that kind of trouble.

353
00:15:57,249 --> 00:15:58,518
Well, I got problems of my own.

354
00:15:58,542 --> 00:16:01,062
Apparently, there was a whole HR meeting

355
00:16:01,086 --> 00:16:05,316
about my totally involuntary
and completely understandable incident.

356
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,610
Your dick caused an HR situation?

357
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:09,571
- Yeah.
- Interesting.

358
00:16:09,595 --> 00:16:12,949
- Now we have to rehearse the scene...
- What if it happens again?

359
00:16:12,973 --> 00:16:16,077
Just be a professional
and go crank your hog first.

360
00:16:16,101 --> 00:16:19,229
I'm not gonna pleasure
myself at work, Clay.

361
00:16:19,605 --> 00:16:21,457
That's practically all I do.

362
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:23,901
Why do you think I never know my lines?

363
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:29,674
Okay, it's, uh, 3:00

364
00:16:29,698 --> 00:16:33,011
and we are still in the A scene.

365
00:16:33,035 --> 00:16:37,390
That's because it took you guys
an hour to decide where to get lunch.

366
00:16:37,414 --> 00:16:39,684
And then an hour to complain
about the lunch once it got here.

367
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,644
That meatloaf is, is still
not sitting well with me.

368
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:44,355
- Oh my god.
- Oh, what, what organ is-is right here?

369
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:45,440
Please don't die.

370
00:16:45,464 --> 00:16:47,609
Then I'd be the schlockiest writer alive.

371
00:16:47,633 --> 00:16:48,985
What about Murray Klein?

372
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:52,489
Murray Klein died on a sound stage
just like all his pictures.

373
00:16:52,513 --> 00:16:54,199
He should rest in peace.

374
00:16:54,223 --> 00:16:56,826
Terrible writer, but a fantastic lay.

375
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,579
Oh, sweet Jesus. Okay, can we,
can we please get back to the story?

376
00:16:59,603 --> 00:17:00,270
All right.

377
00:17:00,562 --> 00:17:02,749
Cody is broke, why is he broke?

378
00:17:02,773 --> 00:17:04,292
Crippling student loans.

379
00:17:04,316 --> 00:17:05,919
Inflation. Gas prices.

380
00:17:05,943 --> 00:17:10,173
He, He lost his job because he
falls asleep whenever he hears a bell.

381
00:17:10,197 --> 00:17:11,591
Ha!

382
00:17:11,615 --> 00:17:12,634
What?

383
00:17:12,658 --> 00:17:15,178
- What do you mean "what?"
- Obviously, he's been hypnotized.

384
00:17:15,202 --> 00:17:16,055
Thank you.

385
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,305
When I was on the Lampoon...

386
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:18,598
Okay, that's four.

387
00:17:18,622 --> 00:17:19,748
I count five.

388
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:22,977
What, what about, um, crypto or an NFT?

389
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:25,063
What the hell is an NFT?

390
00:17:25,087 --> 00:17:27,524
What if Cody loses
his shirt playin' the ponies?

391
00:17:27,548 --> 00:17:31,194
So, he's addicted to gambling
and he supports animal abuse.

392
00:17:31,218 --> 00:17:33,303
I thought gay people
were supposed to be fun.

393
00:17:36,515 --> 00:17:39,661
I'm gonna order you some
of those boxer briefs in fun colors.

394
00:17:39,685 --> 00:17:41,371
Ooh, thank you.

395
00:17:41,395 --> 00:17:44,082
I like it 'cause you don't see
a panty line on TV.

396
00:17:44,106 --> 00:17:45,899
Yeah.

397
00:17:46,191 --> 00:17:48,986
- Hey, guys.
- We got a little situation here.

398
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:51,822
This dude's from corporate HR.

399
00:17:52,364 --> 00:17:55,552
Hi, I'm, uh, Tony Finger ton.

400
00:17:55,576 --> 00:17:57,887
Well, hello, Mr. Finger ton.

401
00:17:57,911 --> 00:18:00,723
May I offer you some grapes or a Go-Gurt?

402
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:03,142
- Oh, yeah, uh, sure.
- Uh, both would be...

403
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:05,520
No. We're not gonna give
this creep anything.

404
00:18:05,544 --> 00:18:07,546
Wait 'til you hear what he has to say.

405
00:18:08,213 --> 00:18:09,214
Fine.

406
00:18:09,673 --> 00:18:14,654
Uh, uh, we've, uh, received word
of, um, unreported on-set romance,

407
00:18:14,678 --> 00:18:16,680
which goes against, um,

408
00:18:17,431 --> 00:18:21,393
s... uh, section four
of the employee conduct handbook.

409
00:18:21,643 --> 00:18:23,037
But she's not even an employee.

410
00:18:23,061 --> 00:18:25,748
- W... Uh, well, um...
- That's what I said,

411
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:28,459
but he said it's a problem
because you were a minor

412
00:18:28,483 --> 00:18:29,961
when your mom and I originally met.

413
00:18:29,985 --> 00:18:33,256
Correct. I-I-I'm sorry,
but if you don't end the relationship,

414
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,009
we will find Mr. Barber
in violation of his contract

415
00:18:36,033 --> 00:18:38,327
and he will be terminated immediately.

416
00:18:38,702 --> 00:18:41,139
- Oh my.
- What?! That's B.S.!

417
00:18:41,163 --> 00:18:42,724
Language.

418
00:18:42,748 --> 00:18:44,583
Aw, man, bro.

419
00:18:45,876 --> 00:18:48,295
You've got a tough decision to make.

420
00:18:48,504 --> 00:18:49,898
Okay.

421
00:18:49,922 --> 00:18:53,467
Do we dare try the kiss
at the top for real this time?

422
00:18:54,009 --> 00:18:54,862
I don't know, Jerry,

423
00:18:54,886 --> 00:18:59,449
I would hate to see Reed punch a hole
in a perfectly good vajoga.

424
00:18:59,473 --> 00:19:01,159
Yeah, yeah, yeah. We
can do the kiss.

425
00:19:01,183 --> 00:19:03,203
Are you sure you can handle it?

426
00:19:03,227 --> 00:19:04,162
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

427
00:19:04,186 --> 00:19:04,997
- Yeah.
- Okay.

428
00:19:05,021 --> 00:19:08,166
Okay, I am an artist,
and I have control of my instrument.

429
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:10,585
As long as I don't feel
your instrument on my leg.

430
00:19:10,609 --> 00:19:12,837
All right, people, settle,

431
00:19:12,861 --> 00:19:17,217
and may god have mercy
on our souls, action.

432
00:19:17,241 --> 00:19:20,595
- Finally, have the house to ourselves.
- Mm-hm.

433
00:19:34,633 --> 00:19:35,634
Bree?

434
00:19:37,845 --> 00:19:39,263
Are you crying?

435
00:19:42,182 --> 00:19:46,412
- Wait, are you okay?
- No, I just...

436
00:19:46,436 --> 00:19:48,105
Wait, Bree, are you okay?

437
00:19:50,774 --> 00:19:52,085
What'd you do this time?

438
00:19:52,109 --> 00:19:55,904
That was not my fault,
completely flaccid over here!

439
00:20:01,827 --> 00:20:02,804
Hello.

440
00:20:02,828 --> 00:20:06,015
Look, I am so upset
about this whole HR situation,

441
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:07,976
- but you know the rules...
- Stop it.

442
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,689
I knew the whole thing was fake the minute
"Mr. Finger ton" opened his mouth.

443
00:20:12,713 --> 00:20:15,108
- What?
- Clay.

444
00:20:15,132 --> 00:20:18,361
- Okay, Susan, hold on. Don't get mad. I...
- I'm not mad,

445
00:20:18,385 --> 00:20:21,239
but I am very disappointed.

446
00:20:21,263 --> 00:20:23,182
Oh my god, that's so much worse.

447
00:20:23,724 --> 00:20:25,326
Look, it's not what you think.
I can explain,

448
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:28,079
so there's no reason to start freakin' out
and smashing windshields...

449
00:20:28,103 --> 00:20:29,103
What?!

450
00:20:29,813 --> 00:20:31,690
Wait, is that what Zack told you?

451
00:20:33,108 --> 00:20:34,627
Oh, I see what's happening here.

452
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:37,797
Can I be vulgar for a moment?

453
00:20:37,821 --> 00:20:38,947
You're askin' me?

454
00:20:40,532 --> 00:20:43,744
I like... to fuck.

455
00:20:44,536 --> 00:20:46,764
And that's not easy for a son
to understand about his mother,

456
00:20:46,788 --> 00:20:49,642
especially after a divorce.

457
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:55,297
I broke that windshield
from inside the car... with my foot

458
00:20:55,964 --> 00:20:58,091
while having an orgasm.

459
00:20:58,717 --> 00:21:00,737
The neighbors heard and called the police.

460
00:21:00,761 --> 00:21:03,573
Jesus, that's actually impressive.

461
00:21:03,597 --> 00:21:05,074
I owe it all to kettle bells.

462
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:09,496
So, you're not mad that
I don't wanna have a relationship?

463
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,539
I was married for 25 years.

464
00:21:11,563 --> 00:21:15,400
I only go after men who have
nothing to offer me romantically.

465
00:21:16,068 --> 00:21:20,048
Rough trade boys like yourself
are... kind of my thing.

466
00:21:20,072 --> 00:21:22,509
Well, being called a rough trade boy

467
00:21:22,533 --> 00:21:25,512
by women like you is,
uh, kind of my thing.

468
00:21:25,536 --> 00:21:27,639
Now that Zack thinks
you'll get fired if we're together,

469
00:21:27,663 --> 00:21:30,916
it's even more forbidden
than it was before.

470
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:32,144
Hm.

471
00:21:32,168 --> 00:21:34,938
Maybe someday when
you're drunk and misbehaving,

472
00:21:34,962 --> 00:21:37,965
you'll gimme a call
and I'll come and set ya straight.

473
00:21:38,715 --> 00:21:41,718
I'd like that, Susan... I really would.

474
00:21:42,094 --> 00:21:43,929
Take care of yourself, Clayton.

475
00:21:46,306 --> 00:21:47,516
But not too well.

476
00:21:54,731 --> 00:21:56,358
She's a heck of a woman.

477
00:21:58,151 --> 00:22:00,713
I probably would've chosen my career, too.

478
00:22:00,737 --> 00:22:02,507
Well, it was neck and neck.

479
00:22:02,531 --> 00:22:04,533
Thanks for being so cool to my mom.

480
00:22:05,367 --> 00:22:06,427
It was great seeing her happy.

481
00:22:06,451 --> 00:22:08,161
Well, she's a nice lady.

482
00:22:08,495 --> 00:22:10,497
At least you're still my TV dad.

483
00:22:12,207 --> 00:22:16,170
- Yeah, well...
- see ya tomorrow.

484
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:17,713
Good night.

485
00:22:22,259 --> 00:22:24,779
Look. Hey, I'm goin' to get
a hamburger after this,

486
00:22:24,803 --> 00:22:27,431
- so if you wanna...
- Seriously?

487
00:22:28,056 --> 00:22:30,118
- Shotgun!
- Hey, calm down, separate cars.

488
00:22:30,142 --> 00:22:31,143
Right.

489
00:22:32,102 --> 00:22:33,163
Race ya!

490
00:22:36,023 --> 00:22:40,879
I can't believe I cried in front
of everybody like that today.

491
00:22:40,903 --> 00:22:42,755
- Can I ask you something?
- Mm-hm.

492
00:22:42,779 --> 00:22:44,465
Why did you and Reed break up?

493
00:22:44,489 --> 00:22:48,928
- Oh, we made each other crazy.
- In the good way and the bad way.

494
00:22:48,952 --> 00:22:53,373
It was just too intense to last.
Totally the opposite with my ex-husband.

495
00:22:53,707 --> 00:22:55,643
Maybe that's why you ran off with him.

496
00:22:55,667 --> 00:22:58,813
Yeah, I might have over-corrected.

497
00:22:58,837 --> 00:23:00,255
So, today?

498
00:23:00,631 --> 00:23:04,152
- I think kissing Reed...
- took me back to the years

499
00:23:04,176 --> 00:23:08,823
when someone made
me feel sexy... and loved.

500
00:23:08,847 --> 00:23:12,535
And I got overwhelmed
with how long it's been.

501
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,919
Well, not having that
in your marriage must've been awful.

502
00:23:15,979 --> 00:23:19,792
- It, It was good in the beginning.
- Anders and I had a lot of nice times.

503
00:23:19,816 --> 00:23:23,946
I got to wear a crown,
they named an iceberg after me.

504
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:27,032
Wait, were they calling me cold?

505
00:23:27,741 --> 00:23:28,801
- Well...
- What?

506
00:23:28,825 --> 00:23:30,011
If it makes you feel any better,

507
00:23:30,035 --> 00:23:31,846
half of the guys
on the crew wanna bang you.

508
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:34,682
Oh my god! No, they don't.

509
00:23:34,706 --> 00:23:36,351
- Do they?
- Yeah.

510
00:23:36,375 --> 00:23:38,394
Even the cute grip who looks like Jesus?

511
00:23:38,418 --> 00:23:41,105
You are an 11 out of 10.

512
00:23:41,129 --> 00:23:42,774
If you were feeling yourself,
you could take anybody

513
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:44,818
in this bar home tonight.

514
00:23:44,842 --> 00:23:48,011
I think that is what you need
to get yourself right again.

515
00:23:48,554 --> 00:23:50,073
- Maybe you're right.
- Mm-hm.

516
00:23:50,097 --> 00:23:54,452
- Maybe I need to have hot, crazy, meaningless sex with a stranger...
- Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

517
00:23:54,476 --> 00:23:57,288
- No strings attached...
- Hello, ladies.

518
00:23:57,312 --> 00:23:59,123
- Couldn't help overhearing...
- Nope.

519
00:23:59,147 --> 00:24:00,148
O-kay.

520
00:24:13,954 --> 00:24:15,390
Can you not do that, please?

521
00:24:15,414 --> 00:24:16,683
You want me to throw 'em on the floor?

522
00:24:16,707 --> 00:24:18,292
That's where your nuts usually are.

523
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:21,396
I don't love how much
you talk about Alan's genitals.

524
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:23,439
I'm sorry. Low-hangin' fruit.

525
00:24:23,463 --> 00:24:24,649
How does she do it?

526
00:24:24,673 --> 00:24:26,442
Okay, can we please
get back to the story?

527
00:24:26,466 --> 00:24:29,487
Okay? Anybody, Josie and Whitney?

528
00:24:29,511 --> 00:24:31,096
All right, Josie and Whitney.

529
00:24:32,806 --> 00:24:36,161
Were we too quick to dismiss
the hot, clumsy delivery guy?

530
00:24:36,185 --> 00:24:38,371
- No.
- No. You've got to stop pitching that.

531
00:24:38,395 --> 00:24:40,999
- I'm telling you, it'd work.
- It's too sitcom-y.

532
00:24:41,023 --> 00:24:42,792
- It's funny.
- None of us laughed.

533
00:24:42,816 --> 00:24:45,795
You know, between us, we have
150 years in this business

534
00:24:45,819 --> 00:24:48,923
and you guys haven't laughed at anything
coming from this side of the table.

535
00:24:48,947 --> 00:24:51,509
I don't know, I laughed at some
of the sounds coming out of Alan.

536
00:24:51,533 --> 00:24:54,262
- Story of my life.
- I love onions, they don't love me.

537
00:24:54,286 --> 00:24:57,265
I'm telling you, it could be
symptoms of something serious.

538
00:24:57,289 --> 00:25:00,101
Uh, I'm sorry, I, I just
think some of the jokes

539
00:25:00,125 --> 00:25:03,688
you guys tell are a, a little c-corny.

540
00:25:03,712 --> 00:25:06,149
Yeah, and a lot of them
are wildly offensive.

541
00:25:06,173 --> 00:25:08,526
They're like the ones
my memaw tells at Thanksgiving.

542
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:11,154
- She sounds funny.
- Does she have a.

543
00:25:11,178 --> 00:25:12,822
Okay, yeah, I'm gonna
just state the obvious.

544
00:25:12,846 --> 00:25:15,492
So, we're coming from two
entirely different planets here.

545
00:25:15,516 --> 00:25:19,078
Listen, sometimes it takes a while
for a room to come together.

546
00:25:19,102 --> 00:25:20,705
We're never gonna come together.

547
00:25:20,729 --> 00:25:22,564
Selma! Don't even.

548
00:25:22,814 --> 00:25:24,626
Gimme four dildos and a metronome.

549
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:26,878
You are a broken woman.

550
00:25:26,902 --> 00:25:30,298
Gordon, your writers and my writers
have nothing in common.

551
00:25:30,322 --> 00:25:32,342
So, don't you think that
says something about us?

552
00:25:32,366 --> 00:25:35,136
Says I know how to hire writers,
nothing personal.

553
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,513
Seems personal.

554
00:25:36,537 --> 00:25:39,933
You know... we've barely spoken
for the last 25 years,

555
00:25:39,957 --> 00:25:42,977
so I think we were fucking crazy
to think this could work.

556
00:25:43,001 --> 00:25:45,271
Maybe this is not the place
for that conversation.

557
00:25:45,295 --> 00:25:49,299
Or maybe there's just
nothing left to discuss... Yeah.

558
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:53,446
- Where you going?
- Guys, I'm, I-I'm really sorry

559
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:54,989
I dragged you all into this, truly I am.

560
00:25:55,013 --> 00:25:56,533
Gordon, you know what?
You said this is your show,

561
00:25:56,557 --> 00:25:58,058
so do it your way.

562
00:25:58,433 --> 00:26:00,036
- What, you're quitting?
- Not much use in a room

563
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:03,623
full of people who can't agree
on a single goddamn thing that's funny.

564
00:26:03,647 --> 00:26:06,459
Ah! Ow, fuck me.

565
00:26:09,611 --> 00:26:12,465
Don't laugh, you guys are assholes.

566
00:26:12,489 --> 00:26:15,385
- Oh, my baby, are you okay?
- No.

567
00:26:15,409 --> 00:26:17,661
I'm talking to the garbage can.

568
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:24,477
- I don't know why I'm laughing?
- I'm in so much pain.

569
00:26:24,501 --> 00:26:25,728
Wait, wait, wait!

570
00:26:25,752 --> 00:26:28,273
Josie should eat it like that
in the kitchen scene.

571
00:26:28,297 --> 00:26:29,482
- Ooh, absolutely!
- Yeah!

572
00:26:29,506 --> 00:26:33,027
Especially if she just finished giving
some big, melodramatic speech.

573
00:26:33,051 --> 00:26:34,863
And then she trips over an extension cord

574
00:26:34,887 --> 00:26:38,575
'cause Cody's got his computer plugged in
and he's workin' on one of those NFTs.

575
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:40,618
- Okay, Alan, I see you.
- Yes!

576
00:26:40,642 --> 00:26:43,580
I still don't know what it is,
but I like that somebody's falling.

577
00:26:43,604 --> 00:26:47,584
- Falling is always funny.
- Yes. Falling's funny.

578
00:26:51,236 --> 00:26:52,047
All right.

579
00:26:52,071 --> 00:26:55,842
Well, uh, we should
probably order some dinner.

580
00:26:55,866 --> 00:26:57,927
Yes, how 'bout a nice
deli platter from Nate 'n Al's?

581
00:26:57,951 --> 00:27:00,180
- Ooh.
- I do like their salami.

582
00:27:00,204 --> 00:27:04,100
- I bet you do, you old whore.
- You are fun.

583
00:27:04,124 --> 00:27:07,127
You know about salami, huh?

584
00:27:18,305 --> 00:27:19,723
- Hello?
- Hey.

585
00:27:20,182 --> 00:27:24,394
I tried to catch up with you today,
but they said that you took off.

586
00:27:25,145 --> 00:27:29,584
Just, uh, wanted to check in
in a, in a totally non-condescending way.

587
00:27:29,608 --> 00:27:32,837
I'm doing better, thanks.

588
00:27:32,861 --> 00:27:34,696
Good... Very good.

589
00:27:35,364 --> 00:27:39,368
I also wanted to, uh,
let you know that you were right.

590
00:27:40,035 --> 00:27:44,098
Um... deep down, I was worried about,

591
00:27:44,122 --> 00:27:46,726
you know, whether I was gonna
feel that old spark again

592
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:48,645
ever since I heard
the show was coming back,

593
00:27:48,669 --> 00:27:51,064
and, obviously, I still felt it,

594
00:27:51,088 --> 00:27:55,109
and... uh, you literally did as well.

595
00:27:55,133 --> 00:28:00,740
But I... just, uh,
I just, uh, had a sense today that,

596
00:28:00,764 --> 00:28:03,535
uh, maybe you felt something too.

597
00:28:03,559 --> 00:28:05,745
So, you know, if you
wanted to talk about it.

598
00:28:05,769 --> 00:28:06,769
You know what?

599
00:28:07,104 --> 00:28:08,414
I appreciate you saying that,

600
00:28:08,438 --> 00:28:10,834
but I'm actually in a really
good place right now.

601
00:28:10,858 --> 00:28:11,858
Oh.

602
00:28:12,776 --> 00:28:13,776
Okay.

603
00:28:14,194 --> 00:28:15,404
Glad to hear it.

604
00:28:16,154 --> 00:28:18,156
Yeah... Good night, Reed.

605
00:28:19,992 --> 00:28:21,201
Good night?

606
00:28:23,787 --> 00:28:25,431
Everything okay?

607
00:28:25,455 --> 00:28:26,891
Everything's great.

608
00:28:37,551 --> 00:28:38,570
No!

608
00:28:39,305 --> 00:29:39,231
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
