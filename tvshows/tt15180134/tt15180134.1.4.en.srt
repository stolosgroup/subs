1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:00:35,661 --> 00:00:37,639
I'm sorry if that woke you.

3
00:00:37,663 --> 00:00:40,141
Oh no, what time is it?

4
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:41,810
Whoo! 7:30.

5
00:00:41,834 --> 00:00:43,728
Oh, I wish I could stay in bed,

6
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:46,564
but I have like 30 cameos
to shoot before work.

7
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:48,632
Uh, the worst.

8
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:53,071
Hey, last night was really fun.

9
00:00:53,095 --> 00:00:54,447
Really?

10
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:55,782
I don't know if you could tell

11
00:00:55,806 --> 00:00:57,700
but that was my first time
with a lesbian woman.

12
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:59,702
Okay, you don't need to say both,

13
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:01,287
and I don't really use labels.

14
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:03,063
Oh. Okay.

15
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:04,874
Okay.

16
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:07,877
I'm glad you're so cool about this.
So chill.

17
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,255
The last time I got busy with a coworker,

18
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:12,674
Reed, it got weird.

19
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:14,968
Maybe because you
used the term "got busy."

20
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:16,427
What do people say now?

21
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:17,804
Fucking?

22
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:20,139
Oh yeah. I'm used to network television.

23
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:22,267
Look, don't worry.

24
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:23,750
It's not weird.

25
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:25,770
We're friends.

26
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:27,105
Friends?

27
00:01:27,129 --> 00:01:28,755
I love that.

28
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:32,485
It's been so long since I've
had a friend that was a woman.

29
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:35,280
My last one was technically my assistant,

30
00:01:35,304 --> 00:01:37,157
but then she started charging my Amex.

31
00:01:37,181 --> 00:01:39,784
Like I'm not gonna notice
a charge for a Bowflex.

32
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:42,328
Hey, if it's cool,
I'm gonna hop in the shower.

33
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:45,105
Okay. Yeah. No, totally. Um...

34
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:48,209
but, before you go in,

35
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:49,401
I'm just...

36
00:01:50,986 --> 00:01:53,298
since it was my first time with a,

37
00:01:53,322 --> 00:01:55,049
a lady,

38
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:57,242
did I do it right?

39
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:00,537
Bree, you slayed.

40
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:08,337
That means you were great!

41
00:02:08,921 --> 00:02:10,273
<i>♪ If you're having girl problems ♪</i>

42
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:11,566
<i>♪ I feel bad for you, son ♪</i>

43
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:15,511
<i>♪ I got 99 problems
and a bitch ain't one ♪</i>

44
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:29,417
- Oh, hello.
- Hello!

45
00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:30,585
You're looking chipper.

46
00:02:30,609 --> 00:02:32,212
- Oh, 'cause I feel chipper.
- Oh, new.

47
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:34,297
- Um, since I have you...
- Mh-mm.

48
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:36,716
About me calling you last night.

49
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:37,884
Oh, do we have to do that?

50
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:39,952
- No, absolutely we do not.
- Okay, good.

51
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:45,099
I just, I just don't want you to
get the wrong impression, okay.

52
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:47,060
I'm not harboring feelings for you.

53
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:48,728
I'm just missing Nora.

54
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:50,879
No worries. I am good.

55
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:54,150
So, you're Gatorade good?

56
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,528
Yes. Yes, I am.

57
00:02:56,552 --> 00:02:59,781
'Cause I just remember
the only time you drank Gatorade

58
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:02,784
is after, you know, getting busy, so.

59
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:04,160
Just say fucking.

60
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,978
Yeah, uh...

61
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:09,249
I didn't realize that
you were back out there.

62
00:03:09,273 --> 00:03:12,544
Well, Timberly and I went
out to a hotspot last night.

63
00:03:12,568 --> 00:03:13,861
It was really fun.

64
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:15,839
- You and Timberly.
- Mh-mm.

65
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:17,781
- That's weird.
- Why is it weird?

66
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:21,010
Last week you tried to destroy her.

67
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,304
I was being silly.
We're good friends now.

68
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:26,331
If you'll excuse me,
I have to go do 40 cameos.

69
00:03:28,584 --> 00:03:31,437
You know, another interesting
thing about the Gatorade

70
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:32,461
is that...

71
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:48,705
Well, thank you again
for meeting with me.

72
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:50,832
Oh yeah, of course. I'm stoked.

73
00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:53,793
None of the other executives
ever wanted to meet with me before.

74
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:55,235
- Really?
- Yeah.

75
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:57,922
I even invited them to
my eighth birthday party.

76
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:00,133
- Aw.
- Oh, it's okay.

77
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:02,957
They were probably just freaked out
about having to wear bathing suits.

78
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:04,387
How old were you

79
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:06,723
- when you first started working?
- Four.

80
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:09,517
I said "ouchie" in a Band-Aid commercial.

81
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:11,335
Pretty crazy working so young, huh?

82
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:16,774
Actually, I started a little
business when I was six.

83
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,300
Oh, cool. Like a lemonade stand?

84
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,446
I invented a glucose
monitor for my diabetic cat,

85
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,114
which was subsequently purchased

86
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:24,991
by a pharmaceutical company.

87
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:26,367
Awesome.

88
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:28,227
So we both started in the medical field.

89
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:30,187
Yeah.

90
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:38,338
So, besides <i>Step Right Up,</i>

91
00:04:38,362 --> 00:04:40,215
do you have any other
projects in development

92
00:04:40,239 --> 00:04:41,633
that you're excited about?

93
00:04:41,657 --> 00:04:44,034
Actually, yes. Thank you for asking.

94
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:48,247
I'm currently developing
a batting cage in my backyard.

95
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:53,335
Boom!

96
00:04:57,381 --> 00:04:59,150
Uh...

97
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:02,070
Ah, look at this.
A donut with bacon.

98
00:05:02,094 --> 00:05:03,738
Who do you think's gonna
have a heart attack first,

99
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:04,823
me or my rabbi?

100
00:05:04,847 --> 00:05:07,700
Remember when they first
put potato chips in a can?

101
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:09,035
You know what? I am tempted though.

102
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:11,079
That's actually a fonut.

103
00:05:11,103 --> 00:05:13,665
It's gluten-free and the facon
is made with beans.

104
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:15,440
Okay. Why would you tell me that?

105
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,878
Hey, Reed, I'm confused.

106
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:21,214
Does the Cody character
live above the garage

107
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:22,423
or in the basement?

108
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:25,009
Nobody knows. It's a whole thing.

109
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:27,053
- Ugh.
- Oh, oh, Timberly.

110
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:29,430
- Yeah?
- I heard that you and Bree went out last night.

111
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:30,497
Sure did.

112
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:33,309
May I just say, brava.

113
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,437
Bree's been having a rough go of it
since the divorce.

114
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:38,481
Oh, I know. I was like, girl,

115
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:40,358
you think you can't get it,
but you can totally get it.

116
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:43,695
Uh, yes. And I understand she got it.

117
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:45,637
Uh, yeah. She got it.

118
00:05:46,138 --> 00:05:49,725
Ah, well,
I'm very proud of her, you know?

119
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:52,561
Nice guy, I hope.

120
00:05:53,145 --> 00:05:54,414
Well.

121
00:05:54,438 --> 00:05:56,398
Not a nice guy?

122
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:58,901
It wasn't a guy.

123
00:06:00,444 --> 00:06:01,421
Oh.

124
00:06:01,445 --> 00:06:02,487
Hm.

125
00:06:05,157 --> 00:06:07,326
You?

126
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:09,637
Hm.

127
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:12,039
You two. You two?

128
00:06:13,332 --> 00:06:18,086
Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool.

129
00:06:18,587 --> 00:06:20,732
Did I just blow your mind, boomer?

130
00:06:20,756 --> 00:06:23,193
What, what?

131
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:25,862
No, girl. That don't phase me.

132
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:27,405
Hm?
Timberly?

133
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:28,865
- Yeah?
- Mind if I steal you?

134
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:30,492
We're about to block the basement scene.

135
00:06:30,516 --> 00:06:32,076
Is that where Cody lives?

136
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,894
Please don't ask me. I can't.

137
00:06:39,525 --> 00:06:42,086
- I'm, uh, freaking out.
- About what?

138
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,755
Never mind, I don't care.

139
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:46,591
Last night I called Bree and she was

140
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:48,426
uncharacteristically dismissive.

141
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,720
Again, I could not care less
about this conversation.

142
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:52,514
She was having sex with Timberly.

143
00:06:52,538 --> 00:06:53,598
Go on.

144
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:55,934
Bree's into women now?

145
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:57,727
Which, you know, which is cool.

146
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:58,937
It's all good. It's good in the hood.

147
00:06:58,961 --> 00:07:00,355
Ain't no thing.

148
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:02,273
You really need to hang out
with more Black people.

149
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:04,442
That's fair. I'm just stunned.

150
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:07,111
This is so not like Bree.

151
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:10,782
- But it is very Timberly.
- What do you mean?

152
00:07:10,806 --> 00:07:13,618
They used to call her "Sin-berly"
on <i>Fuck Buddy Mountain.</i>

153
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:16,496
Men, women, that chick is
up and down for anything.

154
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,249
Wait, are you watching
that stupid reality show?

155
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:21,668
Well you can't imagine
how badass these women are.

156
00:07:21,692 --> 00:07:23,670
Like when Tawny crashed her snowmobile

157
00:07:23,694 --> 00:07:26,422
and had to walk three miles
in high heels and a teddy,

158
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,466
only to find Kim in bed with Brody,

159
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,093
who I knew was trouble.

160
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:31,845
Guys, we're way behind.

161
00:07:31,869 --> 00:07:34,514
And you know how cranky Jerry gets
when he's not home by 2:00 PM.

162
00:07:34,538 --> 00:07:35,932
Okay. All right.
Okay. Let's go!

163
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:37,851
Hey, don't tell anyone.

164
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:39,310
We're on a TV set.

165
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:42,171
You think Bree scissoring Timberly
isn't going to get around?

166
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:43,714
Just...

167
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,638
Wait, wait. I'm confused.
What is scissoring?

168
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:54,993
It's when two women spread their legs,

169
00:07:55,017 --> 00:07:57,745
a la scissors, and I don't wanna be crass,

170
00:07:57,769 --> 00:07:59,956
but they rub their pussies together.

171
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,791
- Okay.
- This from a woman who was

172
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:03,501
just showing us pictures of her grandson.

173
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:06,171
- You can't put me in a box.
- Not for another year or so.

174
00:08:06,195 --> 00:08:08,381
Where were these jokes yesterday?

175
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:10,550
Instead of the 50 pitches on oat milk.

176
00:08:10,574 --> 00:08:12,594
For the record, scissoring is bullshit.

177
00:08:12,618 --> 00:08:14,762
It is a fantasy of lesbian sex

178
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:17,473
that exists primarily in porn
made for hetero men.

179
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,100
Why do you have to ruin everything?

180
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:22,353
Why am I having such a hard time
picturing this scissors thing?

181
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:24,355
The whole thing is quite
simple, actually, okay?

182
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:27,192
You have two women,
in this case are Bree and Timberly,

183
00:08:27,216 --> 00:08:30,153
and they lie up on a bed
or perhaps a beach towel

184
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:32,405
with their legs spread akimbo.

185
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:35,533
And then they gingerly
press each other's loins together...

186
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:38,786
Oh god, why does Alan
get to say things like that,

187
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,914
but I get yelled at
for ordering two soups?

188
00:08:40,938 --> 00:08:42,415
Yeah. Let's, let's get back to work.

189
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:45,210
Yeah, yeah. But right after
Alan tells the story about

190
00:08:45,234 --> 00:08:48,630
the time he got the blow job
from Paul Lynde in his Hollywood square.

191
00:08:48,654 --> 00:08:50,256
- Shut up.
- It was the '70s.

192
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,799
I had taken a Quaalude.

193
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:53,426
Oh my God, Paul Lynde is a daddy.

194
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:54,552
What was he like?

195
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:56,513
The man had a jaw like a python.

196
00:08:56,537 --> 00:09:00,517
Okay. Let's just stop
prying into each other's sex lives.

197
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,060
That's half the reason I come to work.

198
00:09:02,084 --> 00:09:04,145
How about you, two soups?

199
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:05,772
Who you bringing the clam chowder home to?

200
00:09:05,796 --> 00:09:08,382
Two soups.
Is that my nickname now?

201
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:11,844
Hannah looks uncomfortable.
Let's talk about her.

202
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:14,405
No, we're not gonna do that.

203
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:15,657
You know what? Hannah's right.

204
00:09:15,681 --> 00:09:16,825
Let's get serious. We got at least

205
00:09:16,849 --> 00:09:18,976
three pages to cut out of this script.

206
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:20,995
And what do we use to cut things.

207
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:23,039
Scissors.

208
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,290
Came up again naturally.

209
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:25,792
Yep I'll tell you a story.

210
00:09:25,816 --> 00:09:27,293
Goldie Hawn,
this is before she was famous.

211
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:29,027
Ugh, not the Goldie Hawn story.

212
00:09:31,822 --> 00:09:33,550
I got all sorts of crazy stories.

213
00:09:33,574 --> 00:09:36,719
One of my fellow jurors on
<i>12 Angry Boys</i> faked a seizure

214
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:38,930
so he could get to his
sister's bowling party.

215
00:09:38,954 --> 00:09:41,516
Wow.
People in Hollywood

216
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:44,018
are so much more dramatic
than I'm used to.

217
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:46,437
In Silicon Valley, a coder is
considered high maintenance

218
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:48,314
if they ask for a standing desk.

219
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:50,692
I want one.

220
00:09:50,716 --> 00:09:52,509
I've only ever used a sitting desk.

221
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:55,864
Well, this has been fun,

222
00:09:55,888 --> 00:09:58,849
but I gotta get back to the office.

223
00:09:59,725 --> 00:10:01,911
You're not gonna come hang out on set
before the run-through?

224
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:05,022
No, I have to read an outline
and try to get through these emails.

225
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:08,150
Your job doesn't sound as fun as mine.

226
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,987
Have you ever seen any of
the cool things on the lot?

227
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:14,591
Come on. I'm giving you a tour.

228
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:16,742
No, no, no.
I gotta get back to the office.

229
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:19,995
- But your phone's going on a tour.
- Hey!

230
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:26,144
Oh, Whitney, come on.
You're a member of the family now.

231
00:10:26,168 --> 00:10:28,229
You can ask me for anything,

232
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:30,023
except for my red Valentino's.

233
00:10:30,047 --> 00:10:31,548
I'm getting buried in those.

234
00:10:32,758 --> 00:10:34,652
The only thing I want
is to be your friend.

235
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:35,676
Come here.

236
00:10:37,346 --> 00:10:38,990
Ooh. I'm liking in this scene today

237
00:10:39,014 --> 00:10:40,867
way more than I did yesterday.

238
00:10:40,891 --> 00:10:42,660
A very nice tender moment.

239
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:44,245
Bygones are now bygones.

240
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:45,580
And we're out.

241
00:10:45,604 --> 00:10:48,917
Hey, so Jerry, would Bree's buried line

242
00:10:48,941 --> 00:10:51,753
be funnier if I made a joke
about wanting the Valentino's?

243
00:10:51,777 --> 00:10:53,922
- Ooh!
- Bree got a laugh on it.

244
00:10:53,946 --> 00:10:55,340
I think she'd get a bigger one.
Let's do it.

245
00:10:55,364 --> 00:10:56,258
- Yeah.
- Okay.

246
00:10:56,282 --> 00:10:57,592
Okay. Let's go again.

247
00:10:57,616 --> 00:10:58,617
I don't give a shit.

248
00:10:59,535 --> 00:11:00,845
Did you see that?

249
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:03,431
Since when is Bree giving away jokes?

250
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:05,642
It's just like what happened on
<i>Fuck Buddy Mountain.</i>

251
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:06,935
What are you talking about?

252
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,103
There was this super sweet girl,
Sarah R,

253
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:10,897
who you just couldn't help but love.

254
00:11:10,921 --> 00:11:12,941
But Timberly saw her as a threat.

255
00:11:12,965 --> 00:11:15,443
So, what does she do?
She seduces her.

256
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:18,696
And Sarah R being the naive Iowa farm girl

257
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,365
let her guard down and then bam.

258
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:21,866
Bam. What do you mean, bam?

259
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:24,077
She gave Timberly her immunity thong.

260
00:11:24,101 --> 00:11:25,411
- Her immunity thong?
- Yeah.

261
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:27,914
And then the naked council
sent her into sex-ile.

262
00:11:27,938 --> 00:11:30,190
- Into sex-ile?
- Yes.

263
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:33,169
You don't think that's why
Timberly had sex with Bree?

264
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:36,089
I don't know, but I'm
on the edge of my seat.

265
00:11:36,113 --> 00:11:38,049
Oh, they're hugging again.

266
00:11:38,073 --> 00:11:40,659
And that's it, we're out.

267
00:11:41,285 --> 00:11:43,471
- Bye-bye.
- See you, Jer.

268
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:44,889
It was funnier, right?

269
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:46,808
- Much better. Funnier.
- Oh, fantastic.

270
00:11:46,832 --> 00:11:48,417
- It's funny.
- Mm-hm.

271
00:11:50,252 --> 00:11:51,479
Hi!

272
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:53,148
Should we keep pitching on the tag

273
00:11:53,172 --> 00:11:55,048
or start to blue sky the next episode?

274
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:56,758
Huh?

275
00:11:57,551 --> 00:11:58,778
You okay?

276
00:11:58,802 --> 00:12:00,679
Yeah. I, um...

277
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:08,413
There's all that sex talk in there,

278
00:12:08,437 --> 00:12:10,898
and we were laughing, and then it hit me.

279
00:12:11,607 --> 00:12:14,169
- My dad doesn't know.
- Doesn't know what?

280
00:12:14,193 --> 00:12:16,045
He clearly knows a lot
more about sex than Bob.

281
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:17,881
No, he doesn't know about me.

282
00:12:17,905 --> 00:12:21,551
You know, that...
that I'm a lesbian.

283
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:24,220
No one says lesbian anymore,
Billie Jean King.

284
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:25,430
Anyway, I just, I don't know.

285
00:12:25,454 --> 00:12:27,098
I feel like I have to
come out all over again.

286
00:12:27,122 --> 00:12:29,058
And it's like I thought
I was done with this shit.

287
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:31,102
I'm, you know, 30-ish years old.

288
00:12:31,126 --> 00:12:32,770
That ish is doing a lot of work.

289
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:34,606
Hmm. At least my bones are strong

290
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:36,649
from having grown up
drinking real fucking milk.

291
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:39,152
I don't understand.
Why didn't you just come out to him?

292
00:12:39,176 --> 00:12:41,821
It's not like he was around
when I came out to my mom.

293
00:12:41,845 --> 00:12:43,698
And I wasn't gonna knock
on his door and be like,

294
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:45,867
"Happy Thanksgiving.
Hope you're having fun

295
00:12:45,891 --> 00:12:46,951
"with the family you left me for.

296
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:49,037
By the way, I like sex with women."

297
00:12:49,061 --> 00:12:50,979
Why don't you just do it now?
Get it over with.

298
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:55,376
You're right. You're right.

299
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,503
Thank you.

300
00:12:56,527 --> 00:12:58,403
I don't why I'm so nervous about this.

301
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:01,257
Although, is it
inappropriate to do at work?

302
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:03,301
Oh, did you not just attend scissorfest?

303
00:13:03,325 --> 00:13:04,493
Right.
Yeah.

304
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:12,936
Hey, um, you busy?

305
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,438
Huh? I got a hankering for something.

306
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:17,315
I don't know what it is, but something.

307
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:19,734
Yeah. Yeah. Mind if I talk
to you for a second?

308
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:21,361
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure.

309
00:13:21,385 --> 00:13:25,073
So today it occurred to me that you...

310
00:13:25,097 --> 00:13:27,867
Oh, my God. When was the last time
anybody cleaned out this place?

311
00:13:27,891 --> 00:13:29,202
Look at that, Sanka.

312
00:13:29,226 --> 00:13:31,120
Yeah. You know what?

313
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:33,957
Uh, never mind. Sorry.

314
00:13:33,981 --> 00:13:35,858
Hey, anybody know if Sanka expires?

315
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:38,986
Would old Sanka be stronger?

316
00:13:42,823 --> 00:13:44,175
Whoa.

317
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:45,659
The costume shop.

318
00:13:49,121 --> 00:13:51,415
There's so much awesome stuff in here.

319
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:56,587
This is amazing.

320
00:13:58,297 --> 00:14:00,257
Oh, this is my favorite aisle.

321
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,779
Check it out.

322
00:14:04,803 --> 00:14:08,074
This is the armor that Russell Crowe
wore in "Gladiator."

323
00:14:08,098 --> 00:14:10,184
- Really?
- Maybe. Who knows.

324
00:14:12,144 --> 00:14:13,395
Wanna try something on?

325
00:14:14,396 --> 00:14:15,439
Here.

326
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:18,751
As amazing as I'd look
in a beekeeper outfit,

327
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:20,587
I think we should get
back for run-through.

328
00:14:20,611 --> 00:14:22,088
We have plenty of time.

329
00:14:22,112 --> 00:14:25,341
No, I really do not feel comfortable...

330
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:27,993
That's pretty...

331
00:14:31,246 --> 00:14:33,415
I feel ridiculous.

332
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:37,461
Whoa.

333
00:14:38,337 --> 00:14:39,755
You look amazing.

334
00:14:40,756 --> 00:14:42,966
- Really?
- Yeah.

335
00:14:44,218 --> 00:14:45,236
Do a British accent.

336
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:47,822
Oh no, I do not do that.

337
00:14:47,846 --> 00:14:50,015
:
Don't be such a fish and chip, gov'nor.

338
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,393
Uh...

339
00:14:54,603 --> 00:14:57,898
:
I'm off to have tea with a... a queen?

340
00:15:00,692 --> 00:15:02,629
Okay. So we did that.

341
00:15:02,653 --> 00:15:05,113
Now let's just go back to
being Americans having fun.

342
00:15:06,073 --> 00:15:07,759
Okay.

343
00:15:07,783 --> 00:15:09,326
I like your outfit...

344
00:15:10,077 --> 00:15:11,495
but it needs something.

345
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:14,915
Ooh!

346
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:19,211
- Oh no.
- And now... you're a fairy.

347
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:24,150
Are you sure we're allowed to do this?

348
00:15:24,174 --> 00:15:25,527
- Of course.
- Okay.

349
00:15:25,551 --> 00:15:26,487
You're a big-shot exec,

350
00:15:26,511 --> 00:15:28,738
you can do whatever you want.
Hey, who the fuck is in here?

351
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:29,930
- Run.
- Oh.

352
00:15:34,518 --> 00:15:36,704
That was so sick.

353
00:15:36,728 --> 00:15:39,833
Ooh, come on, grab a bike.

354
00:15:39,857 --> 00:15:42,544
I can't go riding around the lot
dressed like this.

355
00:15:42,568 --> 00:15:44,921
Sure you can. Everyone will think
we're doing a show.

356
00:15:44,945 --> 00:15:46,548
Ah, okay.

357
00:15:46,572 --> 00:15:48,258
But the bikes aren't ours.

358
00:15:48,282 --> 00:15:50,468
That's what's so great.
They're all over the lot.

359
00:15:50,492 --> 00:15:51,785
Anyone can take them.

360
00:15:56,081 --> 00:15:58,434
I can't believe we're doing this.

361
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,627
You got this.
It's just like riding a bike.

362
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:07,402
Where the hell is my bike?

363
00:16:07,426 --> 00:16:09,511
Come on, man.

364
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:15,743
Bree, we would like to
talk to you about Timberly.

365
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:17,686
What about Timberly?

366
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:20,623
Well, we know that
she is the one with whom

367
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:22,500
you had sex last night.

368
00:16:22,524 --> 00:16:24,627
I'm not giving you any details.

369
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:27,255
- That is not why we're here.
- Although...

370
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,924
We are here as friends.

371
00:16:29,948 --> 00:16:32,677
First of all, if you are a lesbian,

372
00:16:32,701 --> 00:16:33,970
we are here to support you.

373
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:36,514
- That's just wonderful.
- I'm not a lesbian.

374
00:16:36,538 --> 00:16:38,349
I'm sexually fluent.

375
00:16:38,373 --> 00:16:39,976
I think you mean fluid.

376
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,460
I don't believe in labels.

377
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:43,128
Clay...

378
00:16:43,795 --> 00:16:46,274
can you please tell Bree
about "Sin-berly"?

379
00:16:46,298 --> 00:16:47,859
What?

380
00:16:47,883 --> 00:16:50,320
It was episode eight
of <i>Fuck Buddy Mountain,</i>

381
00:16:50,344 --> 00:16:51,988
- "Cucks Versus Sluts."
- "Cucks Versus Sluts."

382
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:54,407
And Timberly's alliance
was really falling apart.

383
00:16:54,431 --> 00:16:56,075
- Falling apart, into shreds.
- Oh, wait,

384
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:57,118
I should go back and tell you about

385
00:16:57,142 --> 00:16:58,703
when the Conway sister showed up.

386
00:16:58,727 --> 00:17:01,331
No, no, no.
The point is, ahem,

387
00:17:01,355 --> 00:17:04,167
we suspect Timberly sees you as a threat,

388
00:17:04,191 --> 00:17:06,628
and is using sex to neutralize you

389
00:17:06,652 --> 00:17:08,028
like she did on the show.

390
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:11,132
What are you talking about?

391
00:17:11,156 --> 00:17:13,510
Honey,
last week you sabotaged her

392
00:17:13,534 --> 00:17:14,886
and now you're giving her your jokes.

393
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:16,471
Timberly and I are friends.

394
00:17:16,495 --> 00:17:18,473
She is a reality star.

395
00:17:18,497 --> 00:17:20,415
She didn't come here to make friends.

396
00:17:22,835 --> 00:17:25,104
My God, but it seemed so real.

397
00:17:25,128 --> 00:17:28,316
Do you think that she was
manipulating me this whole time?

398
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:29,567
I don't know for sure,

399
00:17:29,591 --> 00:17:31,635
but maybe some of those
details would help.

400
00:17:32,803 --> 00:17:33,887
Get out.

401
00:17:36,849 --> 00:17:39,726
- What is this place?
- Come on. You're gonna love this.

402
00:17:55,033 --> 00:17:57,661
- Wow, this is amazing.
- Right?

403
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:05,353
I've loved orchestras ever since
I played a kid conductor.

404
00:18:05,377 --> 00:18:06,628
<i>Mini Maestro.</i>

405
00:18:07,337 --> 00:18:08,815
You were great in that.

406
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:11,759
You know, to prepare for that role,
I watched a bunch of clips of <i>Amadeus.</i>

407
00:18:12,968 --> 00:18:14,320
Can I help you?

408
00:18:14,344 --> 00:18:16,263
Oh, it's okay.
I'm an actor.

409
00:18:17,723 --> 00:18:19,766
You guys sound great. Keep going.

410
00:18:20,517 --> 00:18:22,662
You think I slept with you
to somehow get ahead?

411
00:18:22,686 --> 00:18:25,790
That is what Clay and Reed said
that you did on the reality show.

412
00:18:25,814 --> 00:18:27,792
Everything on that show was scripted.

413
00:18:27,816 --> 00:18:30,461
- The producers told us what to do.
- Really?

414
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:32,988
Bree! It's reality TV. It's all fake.

415
00:18:33,989 --> 00:18:35,633
I didn't know that.

416
00:18:35,657 --> 00:18:37,427
They should put disclaimers on these shows

417
00:18:37,451 --> 00:18:39,095
because this kind of mix-up must happen...

418
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:41,389
- I sound like an idiot.
- You really do.

419
00:18:41,413 --> 00:18:43,016
I mean, do I seem like the type of person

420
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,459
that would ride around
on a snowmobile topless?

421
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,003
Sort of.

432
00:19:16,406 --> 00:19:18,534
Daniel. Hello.

00:19:19,368 --> 00:19:20,845
Having fun?

Yes. No.

435
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:24,933
Zack was just showing me around the lot.

436
00:19:24,957 --> 00:19:28,895
Zack Jackson, this is
Daniel Silva, my boss.

437
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:31,564
- Ouchie.
- Hello, Zack.

438
00:19:31,588 --> 00:19:33,148
It's great having you back on the show.

439
00:19:33,841 --> 00:19:35,860
Great to be back, Dan the man.

440
00:19:35,884 --> 00:19:37,737
I'm so embarrassed right now.

441
00:19:37,761 --> 00:19:39,096
I don't usually...

442
00:19:40,055 --> 00:19:42,242
Obviously this is not
how I typically dress.

443
00:19:42,266 --> 00:19:43,660
I am so sorry.

444
00:19:43,684 --> 00:19:45,995
I'm just glad to see you
out having a little fun.

445
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:47,413
You work so much,

446
00:19:47,437 --> 00:19:49,624
you were starting to freak
the whole team out.

447
00:19:49,648 --> 00:19:52,001
- Oh.
- I guess it's true.

448
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:53,837
Every time we cancel a show,

449
00:19:53,861 --> 00:19:55,863
a junior executive gets their wings.

450
00:19:59,867 --> 00:20:01,719
I can't believe that just happened.

451
00:20:01,743 --> 00:20:04,121
See, it's TV. Things always work out.

<i>♪ Feel alright ♪</i>

453
00:20:12,254 --> 00:20:14,232
Really, Bob? Sunscreen?

454
00:20:14,256 --> 00:20:16,067
It's a 40-second walk to the stage.

455
00:20:16,091 --> 00:20:17,777
My father had a melanoma.

456
00:20:17,801 --> 00:20:19,237
I can't risk it.

Janae, honey, can you get my neck?

458

[ I'm not touching your skin, Bob.
I'd rather jerk off a hobo.

Oh my God, I'm spending way
too much time with you people.

460
00:20:27,561 --> 00:20:30,456
Look, Alan, isn't that the stage
where we shot <i>Bosom Buddies</i>?

461
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,500
- Yeah, that was a fun show, huh?
- Yeah.

462
00:20:32,524 --> 00:20:34,610
Remember how we used to do coke
in the writer's room?

463
00:20:35,194 --> 00:20:37,130
What the hell happened to this business?

464
00:20:37,154 --> 00:20:39,424
You openly did cocaine at work?

465
00:20:39,448 --> 00:20:41,248
Oh yeah, we used to
send the PA to pick it up.

466
00:20:41,742 --> 00:20:43,219
I wonder whatever happened to him.

467
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:45,412
I think he's running Columbia TriStar.

468
00:20:47,122 --> 00:20:48,999
So, how'd it go with your dad?

469
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:51,519
I didn't tell him. Don't shame me.

470
00:20:51,543 --> 00:20:53,897
Honey, you are a fierce,
grown-ass woman.

471
00:20:53,921 --> 00:20:55,523
What the hell is happening?

472
00:20:55,547 --> 00:20:58,526
Why, why do I need to be the one
that keeps sharing shit?

473
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:00,111
Huh? I don't have anything to prove.

474
00:21:00,135 --> 00:21:01,821
I don't have to impress him.

475
00:21:01,845 --> 00:21:02,885
Why do I have to come out?

476
00:21:03,555 --> 00:21:05,742
He should be the one to come in.

477
00:21:05,766 --> 00:21:07,452
Okay. Now you're spiraling, boo.

478
00:21:07,476 --> 00:21:09,787
Oh my God. Stop lecturing me.
You haven't come out to your dad.

479
00:21:09,811 --> 00:21:11,331
Okay. It's hardly the same thing.

480
00:21:11,355 --> 00:21:13,500
Your dad's friend got
a blow job from Paul Lynde.

481
00:21:13,524 --> 00:21:16,527
Back in our town,
my dad tried to ban dancing.

482
00:21:19,947 --> 00:21:21,198
Oh.

483
00:21:21,907 --> 00:21:23,301
And we're back.

484
00:21:23,325 --> 00:21:26,054
Woo-woo! That was awesome.

485
00:21:26,078 --> 00:21:30,183
Oh, thanks for making
my first actor meeting so easy.

486
00:21:30,207 --> 00:21:32,626
Same. First business meeting.

487
00:21:33,877 --> 00:21:35,230
You're really fun.

488
00:21:35,254 --> 00:21:37,190
Did you just call me fun?

489
00:21:37,214 --> 00:21:40,401
I don't think I've ever
been called fun before.

490
00:21:40,425 --> 00:21:42,987
:
Well, you definitely are, milady.

491
00:21:43,011 --> 00:21:46,056
:
Oh, why thank you, my lord.

492
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:50,477
Hey, that's my fucking bike.

493
00:21:50,853 --> 00:21:52,580
Oh, it's okay. I'm an actor.

494
00:21:52,604 --> 00:21:54,165
Nah, I'ma tase your ass.

495
00:21:54,189 --> 00:21:55,274
Sorry!

496
00:22:00,404 --> 00:22:02,215
Whatever happened to Bugles?

497
00:22:02,239 --> 00:22:03,907
We used to have bowls of them.

498
00:22:06,451 --> 00:22:08,054
Hey. Hi, um...

499
00:22:08,078 --> 00:22:09,997
You old enough to remember Bugles?

500
00:22:10,622 --> 00:22:13,101
Yeah, you put them on like witch nails.

501
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:15,478
Yes! Can we get some of those, please?

502
00:22:15,502 --> 00:22:17,296
Anyway, um...

503
00:22:19,089 --> 00:22:20,900
Have you ever seen the movie <i>Footloose</i>?

504
00:22:20,924 --> 00:22:23,987
That the one with the girl
dancing in the Catskills.

505
00:22:24,011 --> 00:22:25,196
Hates Jerry Orbach?

506
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,031
No, that's <i>Dirty Dancing.</i>

507
00:22:27,055 --> 00:22:28,366
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Never cared for that one.

508
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:29,784
A little too Jew-y.

509
00:22:29,808 --> 00:22:31,244
Okay. Just forget I brought that up.

510
00:22:31,268 --> 00:22:33,288
That's not what I wanted to say.
What I wanted to say...

511
00:22:33,312 --> 00:22:35,498
Okay, everyone,
time for run-through.

512
00:22:35,522 --> 00:22:36,875
All right. Thank you, Dennis.

513
00:22:36,899 --> 00:22:38,209
- Yeah.
- This movie talk, can we,

514
00:22:38,233 --> 00:22:40,170
do we have to do it now,
or can wait till after?

515
00:22:40,194 --> 00:22:41,212
Just forget...
Forget it. Not important.

516
00:22:41,236 --> 00:22:42,463
- Forget it.
- All right.

517
00:22:42,487 --> 00:22:44,007
- Carrot, got a carrot.
- Okay.

518
00:22:44,031 --> 00:22:45,199
Fuckin' Dennis.

519
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,142
- Yes, we're still seeing that bullshit.
- Hey!

520
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:55,185
- Hey!
- Are you two...

521
00:22:55,209 --> 00:22:57,103
- What, darling?
- You made me look

522
00:22:57,127 --> 00:22:58,688
- like an idiot.
- The fuck we do?

523
00:22:58,712 --> 00:22:59,898
You got in my head.

524
00:22:59,922 --> 00:23:02,901
So, like an idiot,
I go and I accuse Timberly

525
00:23:02,925 --> 00:23:05,737
of all the things that you said
that she did on her reality show.

526
00:23:05,761 --> 00:23:07,947
And, guess what?
Scripted!

527
00:23:07,971 --> 00:23:08,948
- What?
- Yeah.

528
00:23:08,972 --> 00:23:09,991
Every major plot point.

529
00:23:10,015 --> 00:23:11,493
- No way.
- Yeah.

530
00:23:11,517 --> 00:23:13,411
She brought out the outline

531
00:23:13,435 --> 00:23:15,371
of the episode where
she sleeps with Sarah R,

532
00:23:15,395 --> 00:23:18,291
and then she showed me pictures
of her at Sarah R's wedding.

533
00:23:18,315 --> 00:23:19,792
- Shut the fuck up.
- I will not.

534
00:23:19,816 --> 00:23:21,544
- The honey trampoline?
- That is fake.

535
00:23:21,568 --> 00:23:22,921
Timberly and the snowmobile?

536
00:23:22,945 --> 00:23:24,631
- Fake.
- Kim banging Brody?

537
00:23:24,655 --> 00:23:26,466
- Fake.
- The beaver hunt.

538
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:27,550
Fake.

539
00:23:27,574 --> 00:23:29,469
I feel so manipulated.

540
00:23:29,493 --> 00:23:31,620
How do you think I feel? You idiots.

541
00:23:32,162 --> 00:23:34,557
Okay, here we go.
And action.

542
00:23:34,581 --> 00:23:35,707
That's my cue.

543
00:23:38,836 --> 00:23:40,003
Hey, Cody.

544
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,713
Hello, Whitney.

545
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:44,484
Hey guys.
Can I ask you a question?

546
00:23:44,508 --> 00:23:46,277
Sure, buddy. Shoot.

547
00:23:46,301 --> 00:23:48,279
My boss at work is
really getting on my case,

548
00:23:48,303 --> 00:23:49,656
and I'm not sure what to do.

549
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,825
- What's his name?
- Janet.

550
00:23:51,849 --> 00:23:53,159
Ah.

551
00:23:53,183 --> 00:23:56,287
I was just trying to make sure
no one was taking advantage of you.

552
00:23:56,311 --> 00:23:57,622
You can't do this shit anymore.

553
00:23:57,646 --> 00:23:58,665
We're not a couple.

554
00:23:58,689 --> 00:23:59,916
You're not my protector.

555
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,650
You're right. I'm sorry.

556
00:24:03,026 --> 00:24:05,654
It's, it's just hard for me
to not care about you.

557
00:24:06,196 --> 00:24:08,550
I'm a different person
than I was 15 years ago.

558
00:24:08,574 --> 00:24:10,510
I've been through a lot.

559
00:24:10,534 --> 00:24:11,803
And it's made me stronger.

560
00:24:11,827 --> 00:24:13,388
And for the first time in my life,

561
00:24:13,412 --> 00:24:15,849
I am taking care of myself
without anyone's help,

562
00:24:15,873 --> 00:24:17,475
even if it means that I fall on my face.

563
00:24:17,499 --> 00:24:19,769
But I am not going to,
because I am focused,

564
00:24:19,793 --> 00:24:21,479
I am on top of things...

565
00:24:21,503 --> 00:24:22,981
Bree, you missed your cue.

566
00:24:23,005 --> 00:24:25,150
Shit. This is your fault.

567
00:24:25,174 --> 00:24:26,568
I'm sorry, Jer! I'm sorry!

568
00:24:26,592 --> 00:24:27,528
I didn't hear it.

569
00:24:27,552 --> 00:24:29,487
I didn't hear you.

570
00:24:29,511 --> 00:24:31,281
Should I back it up
or should I just come out?

571
00:24:31,305 --> 00:24:34,159
- What?
- Do you want me to come out now?

572
00:24:34,183 --> 00:24:35,326
Just come out.

573
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:36,977
Okay. Fine. I'm a lesbian.

574
00:24:39,396 --> 00:24:41,416
I'm sorry. I'm a...

575
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,525
I should have said this earlier. And...

576
00:24:44,693 --> 00:24:48,214
Look, I have no idea
why this has been so hard for me to do,

577
00:24:48,238 --> 00:24:50,967
because I spent my entire life
not needing your approval,

578
00:24:50,991 --> 00:24:52,510
and I still don't need your approval.

579
00:24:52,534 --> 00:24:53,678
Mm...

580
00:24:53,702 --> 00:24:58,373
But you're my...
you're my parent.

581
00:24:59,082 --> 00:25:00,977
So you should know.

582
00:25:01,001 --> 00:25:02,669
And I want you to know.

583
00:25:04,463 --> 00:25:05,463
Honey.

584
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,340
I know.

585
00:25:09,134 --> 00:25:11,863
- Wait, you do.
- Yes.

586
00:25:11,887 --> 00:25:13,573
I mean, ever since you were little.

587
00:25:13,597 --> 00:25:15,349
I didn't know, but I knew.

588
00:25:15,849 --> 00:25:18,453
Plus, dummy, when your film came out,

589
00:25:18,477 --> 00:25:19,662
you went on all those interviews

590
00:25:19,686 --> 00:25:21,480
called yourself a queer filmmaker.

591
00:25:23,273 --> 00:25:25,526
Wait, you read, like,
the press and interviews?

592
00:25:25,943 --> 00:25:27,170
Yes.

593
00:25:27,194 --> 00:25:29,154
What? I can't be proud from a distance?

594
00:25:29,863 --> 00:25:30,864
Everyone!

595
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,536
I was also gay last night.

596
00:25:36,245 --> 00:25:37,722
Oh.
That's right.

597
00:25:37,746 --> 00:25:39,516
I'm a sexual fluid

598
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:41,625
and there is nothing wrong with that.
