1
00:00:00,023 --> 00:00:01,351
Do it.

2
00:00:02,063 --> 00:00:03,633
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:06,633 --> 00:00:08,475
<i>I'll do the time.</i>

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,267
You drive me to the police
station right now.

5
00:00:10,269 --> 00:00:12,669
- It's too late.
- I have to go now.

6
00:00:15,741 --> 00:00:17,808
<i>I think you and Des
have a little side business.</i>

7
00:00:18,844 --> 00:00:20,110
I want a cut.

8
00:00:20,112 --> 00:00:21,411
Everything's my fault
even though

9
00:00:21,413 --> 00:00:23,544
I'm the one who told you
to stay away from Grady!

10
00:00:23,569 --> 00:00:26,249
<i>I told you he came after my kid!</i>

11
00:00:26,251 --> 00:00:29,186
I couldn't live with myself
if I made a decision

12
00:00:29,188 --> 00:00:32,055
based on something he said
in a moment of fear.

13
00:00:32,057 --> 00:00:33,723
What should I do?

14
00:00:33,725 --> 00:00:36,760
<i>You think Grant is the son of
Lucas Grant, Judge Lucas Grant.</i>

15
00:00:36,762 --> 00:00:37,861
He could have done
a clinical trial.

16
00:00:37,863 --> 00:00:39,062
He could've done
a million things.

17
00:00:39,064 --> 00:00:41,598
What he could not have done
was give consent.

18
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,966
She's going to say
you had sex, Ben.

19
00:00:42,968 --> 00:00:44,935
And no one is gonna believe her

20
00:00:44,937 --> 00:00:46,903
if we get rid of the tape.

21
00:00:46,905 --> 00:00:50,240
I was born sick, born broken.

22
00:00:50,242 --> 00:00:51,808
<i>So I met with Morgan.</i>

23
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:53,643
He wants to wave the white flag.

24
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,780
- Am I under arrest?
- Let's go.

25
00:00:56,782 --> 00:00:58,248
He wears a wire,
gathers evidence

26
00:00:58,250 --> 00:00:59,783
against his partner.

27
00:00:59,785 --> 00:01:01,118
We offer him immunity.

28
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,986
We will get back to you.

29
00:01:02,988 --> 00:01:05,689
<i>Mary Mitchell,
now known as Mary Harris,</i>

30
00:01:05,691 --> 00:01:07,824
was investigated
for the murder of her mother.

31
00:01:07,826 --> 00:01:09,626
Her mother was found dead
in Chalk Lake

32
00:01:09,628 --> 00:01:11,294
with her hands tied together.

33
00:01:11,296 --> 00:01:13,163
<i>Man, you don't know
who this woman is.</i>

34
00:01:13,165 --> 00:01:14,464
<i>She's been involved in the death</i>

35
00:01:14,466 --> 00:01:16,099
<i>of God knows how many people.</i>

36
00:01:16,101 --> 00:01:18,186
Am I crazy like Mom?

37
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:27,144
<i>Why are you doing this?</i>

38
00:01:27,146 --> 00:01:28,411
<i>What?</i>

39
00:01:28,413 --> 00:01:30,780
<i>Saving people
a trip to Switzerland.</i>

40
00:01:30,782 --> 00:01:32,516
<i>I believe</i>

41
00:01:32,518 --> 00:01:35,285
<i>we should be in control
of our life and our death.</i>

42
00:01:35,287 --> 00:01:36,753
<i>That's liberty.</i>

43
00:01:36,755 --> 00:01:38,588
<i>And dying isn't a crime.</i>

44
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:41,158
<i>But helping people die
makes you a criminal.</i>

45
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,813
<i>You think so?</i>

46
00:01:44,963 --> 00:01:48,198
<i>I mean... yeah.</i>

47
00:01:52,304 --> 00:01:53,870
<i>Is there a long answer?</i>

48
00:01:53,872 --> 00:01:55,605
I should've come forward sooner.

49
00:01:55,607 --> 00:01:58,441
I know that now.

50
00:01:58,443 --> 00:02:02,045
I'd like to explain.

51
00:02:02,047 --> 00:02:04,514
I'm a doctor.
My patient was suffering.

52
00:02:04,516 --> 00:02:07,617
I couldn't just stand by
and do nothing.

53
00:02:14,026 --> 00:02:15,892
<i>God, you don't seem sick.</i>

54
00:02:20,732 --> 00:02:22,365
<i>I'm sorry.
I meant that as compliment.</i>

55
00:02:22,367 --> 00:02:25,335
I'm sorry.
I was acting on instinct.

56
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:42,319
The last time I examined Sid,

57
00:02:42,321 --> 00:02:44,754
his anxiety
was through the roof,

58
00:02:44,756 --> 00:02:46,856
convinced whoever shot him
would finish the job,

59
00:02:46,858 --> 00:02:48,258
even with the cops there.

60
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:51,595
So I thought if transferring
him to a room

61
00:02:51,597 --> 00:02:53,430
made him feel
more secure, then...

62
00:02:53,432 --> 00:02:56,499
Do you know
which porter transferred him?

63
00:02:56,501 --> 00:02:59,669
The one in the gray scrubs.

64
00:02:59,671 --> 00:03:00,770
You know how it is.

65
00:03:00,772 --> 00:03:04,774
I just grabbed
the first one I saw.

66
00:03:04,776 --> 00:03:06,376
I really just wanted
to help him.

67
00:03:06,378 --> 00:03:07,978
The disappearance
of Sid Thomas-Haye

68
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,180
has caused a major
shit-storm around here.

69
00:03:10,182 --> 00:03:11,948
The cops are all over me.

70
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:14,618
They still haven't found him?

71
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:17,454
No, but hopefully
the security footage

72
00:03:17,456 --> 00:03:19,990
will get the cops off my back.

73
00:03:19,992 --> 00:03:21,491
Security footage?

74
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:23,693
Yes, Dr. Taylor
saw an SUV speeding away

75
00:03:23,695 --> 00:03:25,095
from the hospital.

76
00:03:25,097 --> 00:03:27,697
Hopefully when they review
those street cams,

77
00:03:27,699 --> 00:03:29,332
they will find that car.

78
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,108
Well, let me know if I can
do anything more to help.

79
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,252
Will do.

80
00:04:08,906 --> 00:04:13,376
Dr. Harris and I have
an appointment today, 1:00.

81
00:04:14,612 --> 00:04:17,814
Okay, yeah.

82
00:04:17,816 --> 00:04:19,716
Yeah.

83
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:21,484
Okay.

84
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:29,125
<i>I'm just surprised
he took the deal, that's all.</i>

85
00:04:29,127 --> 00:04:30,660
Well, believe it or not,

86
00:04:30,662 --> 00:04:32,595
there are men who can
resist Mary's charms.

87
00:04:32,597 --> 00:04:34,631
I'm just saying that
he and Mary seem pretty tight.

88
00:04:34,633 --> 00:04:36,199
Yeah, well, you and I
are pretty tight,

89
00:04:36,201 --> 00:04:38,301
but I'd wear a wire on your ass
to avoid a murder rap.

90
00:04:38,303 --> 00:04:39,936
All right, what time
is this meeting?

91
00:04:39,938 --> 00:04:41,771
Desmond said 1:00,
and you know if we're late,

92
00:04:41,773 --> 00:04:43,139
someone's gonna die.

93
00:04:43,141 --> 00:04:44,207
Yeah.

94
00:05:01,193 --> 00:05:02,492
- Mary, Mary.
- This isn't a good time.

95
00:05:02,494 --> 00:05:03,560
No, no, I need your advice.

96
00:05:03,562 --> 00:05:04,828
I need your help.

97
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:06,896
What?

98
00:05:06,898 --> 00:05:09,132
The Danvers woman
has asked me to pray.

99
00:05:09,134 --> 00:05:11,468
- Pray with her.
- I'm not gonna do that.

100
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:14,838
I'm a man of medicine, Mary,
you know, science, reality.

101
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,173
- So what's reality?
- Well, he's out of options.

102
00:05:17,175 --> 00:05:19,376
He's mechanically alive.

103
00:05:19,378 --> 00:05:20,844
What about more surgery?

104
00:05:20,846 --> 00:05:22,078
He's not strong enough for that.

105
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,514
- Tell her that.
- You know what I think?

106
00:05:24,516 --> 00:05:26,082
There should be a rule.

107
00:05:26,084 --> 00:05:29,753
I know, against asking doctors
to pray in a hospital.

108
00:05:29,755 --> 00:05:31,388
Well, Dennis,
you have two options.

109
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:33,456
You can grow some balls
and tell Sonia

110
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,158
to pull the plug on her husband

111
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,961
or you can get on your
goddamn knees and pray.

112
00:05:39,764 --> 00:05:41,264
- Mary, are you okay?
- I'm fine.

113
00:05:41,266 --> 00:05:42,332
I have to go.

114
00:05:45,137 --> 00:05:47,103
Here's a riddle.

115
00:05:47,105 --> 00:05:50,073
What has a gunshot wound,
wears a hospital gown,

116
00:05:50,075 --> 00:05:52,142
and can barely walk by himself?

117
00:05:52,144 --> 00:05:53,376
I don't know.

118
00:05:53,378 --> 00:05:55,111
Maybe Prentice and Hall
have seen him.

119
00:05:56,448 --> 00:05:58,415
- That's not even a riddle.
- You're right.

120
00:05:58,417 --> 00:05:59,849
It's a joke.

121
00:05:59,851 --> 00:06:02,185
Ignore them.

122
00:06:04,956 --> 00:06:06,156
Check this out.

123
00:06:06,158 --> 00:06:08,024
There's an SUV.

124
00:06:08,026 --> 00:06:10,260
It's a Yukon XL.

125
00:06:10,262 --> 00:06:11,995
Can't see anything.

126
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:13,430
How do we know if it's Sid?

127
00:06:13,432 --> 00:06:15,999
We run the plates, get a name,
and start asking questions.

128
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:18,268
God, you're so new.

129
00:06:32,483 --> 00:06:34,984
Sid Thomas-Haye.

130
00:06:34,986 --> 00:06:36,486
What about him?

131
00:06:36,488 --> 00:06:38,588
Ellen hauled me in her office
to ask me all sorts of questions

132
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:42,125
since he was transferred
to my ward by you.

133
00:06:42,127 --> 00:06:43,526
- What did you tell her?
- The truth.

134
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:45,328
You should try it sometime.

135
00:06:47,331 --> 00:06:50,266
Did you have anything to do
with that guy's disappearance?

136
00:06:53,437 --> 00:06:54,771
Yes.

137
00:06:54,773 --> 00:06:56,172
Annie, I'm so sorry.

138
00:06:56,174 --> 00:06:59,008
I didn't mean
to get you involved,

139
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:01,911
but I've got it
all under control, I promise.

140
00:07:01,913 --> 00:07:03,947
You promised when we started
this that everything

141
00:07:03,949 --> 00:07:05,782
was going to be fine.

142
00:07:05,784 --> 00:07:08,384
It is so not fine.

143
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:10,587
You are being followed
by the police,

144
00:07:10,589 --> 00:07:12,922
and now you're helping somebody
escape police custody.

145
00:07:12,924 --> 00:07:14,524
I don't even know
what this has become.

146
00:07:14,526 --> 00:07:17,527
- You don't understand.
- I didn't have a choice.

147
00:07:17,529 --> 00:07:19,229
Well, I do.

148
00:07:19,231 --> 00:07:20,430
I quit.

149
00:07:20,432 --> 00:07:23,066
- Annie, wait.
- No.

150
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:25,468
We are going to get caught.

151
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:27,770
And I cannot get caught.

152
00:07:40,452 --> 00:07:42,619
My clothes were strangling me.

153
00:07:57,101 --> 00:08:00,169
Is "Ben" short for something?

154
00:08:00,171 --> 00:08:03,873
Benjamin. Benedict.

155
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:05,041
Benvolio.

156
00:08:09,713 --> 00:08:11,414
You mind telling me why
your pupils are so pinned?

157
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:14,918
It's because
my future's so bright.

158
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,453
What do you want?

159
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:19,130
She likes you, you know.

160
00:08:21,226 --> 00:08:22,692
You really think getting high

161
00:08:22,694 --> 00:08:24,694
is gonna make this any easier?

162
00:08:24,696 --> 00:08:26,329
The first person she's been with

163
00:08:26,331 --> 00:08:28,264
since her marriage ended.

164
00:08:30,701 --> 00:08:32,368
Really?

165
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:34,331
How are you going
to live with yourself?

166
00:08:36,274 --> 00:08:38,341
I'm thinking
I'll inject narcotics

167
00:08:38,343 --> 00:08:41,277
into my veins on the regular.

168
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:42,912
What's your plan, Benvolio?

169
00:08:42,914 --> 00:08:47,317
My plan, my plan, Desmond,
is, I am just doing my job.

170
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:48,585
Throw yourself into the work.

171
00:08:48,587 --> 00:08:51,421
That's a good, solid plan.

172
00:08:51,423 --> 00:08:53,756
But it's the same thing, really.

173
00:08:53,758 --> 00:08:56,459
The drugs, the law...

174
00:08:56,461 --> 00:08:59,295
it's all just an attempt
to control the chaos.

175
00:08:59,297 --> 00:09:02,332
You ever think Mary's the one
that creates the chaos?

176
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:03,900
Yeah, she's good at that.

177
00:09:03,902 --> 00:09:10,974
But if you know her, then you
know that it's worth it, right?

178
00:09:10,976 --> 00:09:13,350
The thing is, I don't know her.

179
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:18,114
What I do know is that
she's out of control,

180
00:09:18,116 --> 00:09:20,483
and this is the only
way she'll stop.

181
00:09:24,054 --> 00:09:26,522
This is gonna break her heart.

182
00:09:32,329 --> 00:09:34,430
Say something.

183
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:40,103
Hail Mary,

184
00:09:40,105 --> 00:09:42,405
full of grace...

185
00:09:53,351 --> 00:09:55,985
Sing along with me, Benvolio.

186
00:11:05,185 --> 00:11:07,185
My...

187
00:11:07,187 --> 00:11:08,853
My...

188
00:11:13,926 --> 00:11:16,728
- It can't be.
- Hi, Mama.

189
00:11:19,699 --> 00:11:22,600
Um, you're kind of hurting me.

190
00:11:22,602 --> 00:11:24,002
Hey.

191
00:11:24,004 --> 00:11:25,937
What are you doing here?

192
00:11:25,939 --> 00:11:28,306
I lost my math book.

193
00:11:30,786 --> 00:11:33,239
Can you go check
under your bed, please.

194
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:36,948
Kevin, what the hell?

195
00:11:37,591 --> 00:11:39,832
How many times have I told you

196
00:11:39,911 --> 00:11:42,512
you can't just come in here
whenever you feel like it?

197
00:11:42,514 --> 00:11:44,014
Cambie needed her math book...

198
00:11:44,016 --> 00:11:46,816
This is not your house anymore.

199
00:11:46,818 --> 00:11:48,351
I should be able to come home

200
00:11:48,353 --> 00:11:51,154
and not worry if someone's
gonna be here or not.

201
00:11:51,156 --> 00:11:53,098
Okay, fine.

202
00:11:53,161 --> 00:11:56,696
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, come here.

203
00:11:56,697 --> 00:11:58,997
It's okay, come here, come here.

204
00:11:58,999 --> 00:12:01,800
It's okay.

205
00:12:01,802 --> 00:12:03,802
It's okay.

206
00:12:03,804 --> 00:12:07,373
It's okay. I got it.

207
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:09,508
Shh, Mary.

208
00:12:10,877 --> 00:12:12,778
Mary, Mary.

209
00:12:16,716 --> 00:12:19,351
- I'm sorry.
- You should take your key back.

210
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:25,758
- Found it. Bye, Mama.
- Good.

211
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,959
Wait, wait.

212
00:12:29,429 --> 00:12:31,597
Okay, okay, Mom.

213
00:12:35,201 --> 00:12:37,169
Little face, I love you.

214
00:12:42,342 --> 00:12:45,544
Mary, hey.

215
00:12:45,546 --> 00:12:47,946
You really need
to get some rest.

216
00:12:47,948 --> 00:12:49,615
All right?

217
00:13:01,361 --> 00:13:04,963
I'm sorry about what
I said the other day.

218
00:13:04,965 --> 00:13:06,565
It's fine.

219
00:13:06,567 --> 00:13:10,402
<i>I just lost it on Kevin, too.</i>

220
00:13:10,404 --> 00:13:11,664
<i>Why?</i>

221
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,207
<i>I don't know.
I guess it's all getting to me.</i>

222
00:13:16,342 --> 00:13:17,743
You know what's weird too?

223
00:13:17,745 --> 00:13:21,180
I keep thinking about Ben,
like, wanting to talk to him.

224
00:13:21,182 --> 00:13:24,616
- Ben the cop.
- Yeah, Ben the cop.

225
00:13:26,586 --> 00:13:28,620
<i>And it's crazy
given the circumstances,</i>

226
00:13:28,622 --> 00:13:30,422
<i>but I really...</i>

227
00:13:30,424 --> 00:13:33,992
thought there was
something there,

228
00:13:33,994 --> 00:13:35,894
but maybe it was
just the great sex.

229
00:13:35,896 --> 00:13:37,563
It wasn't that great.

230
00:13:37,565 --> 00:13:39,198
Saw it.

231
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,066
What, it was like 30 seconds?

232
00:13:41,068 --> 00:13:43,469
It's impossible. I mean...

233
00:13:43,471 --> 00:13:45,737
Yeah, it's impossible.

234
00:13:45,739 --> 00:13:48,907
Yeah, it's impossible because
you're going to jail, Mary.

235
00:13:48,909 --> 00:13:50,509
<i>You can't move forward, right?</i>

236
00:13:50,511 --> 00:13:54,046
You can't get anywhere
without trust.

237
00:13:54,048 --> 00:13:56,882
Trust no one, that's what I say.

238
00:13:59,352 --> 00:14:00,953
What's wrong with you?

239
00:14:00,955 --> 00:14:02,754
Nothing, I'm fine. I'm good.

240
00:14:05,758 --> 00:14:07,559
You're high, God.

241
00:14:07,561 --> 00:14:09,461
<i>- Mary...
- Shit.</i>

242
00:14:09,463 --> 00:14:10,929
I told you she'd notice.
She's a doctor.

243
00:14:10,931 --> 00:14:13,031
Don't lie to me, asshole.
You're high.

244
00:14:13,033 --> 00:14:14,299
Lie to her, asshole.

245
00:14:14,301 --> 00:14:16,535
Fine, fine, I slipped up, okay?

246
00:14:16,537 --> 00:14:18,804
Not okay. When did this happen?

247
00:14:20,273 --> 00:14:22,508
Today. I'm...

248
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:23,775
I'm an idiot. I'm sorry.

249
00:14:23,777 --> 00:14:25,477
Why? What triggered it?

250
00:14:25,479 --> 00:14:26,979
I'm an addict.

251
00:14:26,981 --> 00:14:31,049
I don't need a trigger.
Everything's a... a trigger.

252
00:14:31,051 --> 00:14:32,451
Is it because of what I said?

253
00:14:32,453 --> 00:14:34,520
Jesus, Des, I didn't mean
to blame you.

254
00:14:34,522 --> 00:14:36,321
I was just scared. I...

255
00:14:36,323 --> 00:14:38,457
It's not your fault.

256
00:14:38,459 --> 00:14:40,392
- She's gonna call it off.
- No, she loves it too much.

257
00:14:40,394 --> 00:14:43,495
She's not calling it off
and neither are we.

258
00:14:43,497 --> 00:14:44,930
Hey, it's a disease.

259
00:14:44,932 --> 00:14:47,099
It's a process.

260
00:14:47,101 --> 00:14:48,567
Slips are part of recovery.

261
00:14:48,569 --> 00:14:50,502
That's what they say, right?

262
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,641
Des, I need you.

263
00:14:55,643 --> 00:14:57,543
You're the only person
in my corner right now.

264
00:14:57,545 --> 00:15:00,145
If you lose it, I'll lose it.

265
00:15:02,215 --> 00:15:05,117
After Morgan,
we'll figure this out.

266
00:15:12,493 --> 00:15:15,360
Hi, Des. Mary, right?

267
00:15:15,362 --> 00:15:17,529
- Hi, Morgan.
- Hi, come on in.

268
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:21,133
Do you have visitors, or...

269
00:15:21,135 --> 00:15:24,703
- Yeah, I'm sorry.
- They... they just showed up.

270
00:15:24,705 --> 00:15:27,105
Guys, time to pack it up.

271
00:15:33,313 --> 00:15:35,080
This is the band.

272
00:15:35,082 --> 00:15:36,882
Meet Medieval Carnage.

273
00:15:36,884 --> 00:15:38,350
- Hey there.
- Hi.

274
00:15:38,352 --> 00:15:40,986
- They make me look good.
- You make us look good, man.

275
00:15:40,988 --> 00:15:42,521
Have you seen him shred?

276
00:15:42,523 --> 00:15:43,889
<i>Guy's a genius.</i>

277
00:15:43,891 --> 00:15:45,157
<i>I'm his drummer, Pete.</i>

278
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:46,692
<i>- Hi.
- What's wrong with this guy?</i>

279
00:15:46,694 --> 00:15:49,461
He invites his banger friends
the day he's supposed to die?

280
00:15:49,463 --> 00:15:51,296
You guys friends of Morgan's?

281
00:15:51,298 --> 00:15:52,531
We're counselors.

282
00:15:52,533 --> 00:15:54,566
Kind of like palliative care.

283
00:15:54,568 --> 00:15:56,368
We can come back
if you guys need to...

284
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:57,536
Need to shred or whatever.

285
00:15:57,538 --> 00:15:59,071
<i>No, no, no, let's roll.</i>

286
00:16:00,306 --> 00:16:02,140
I'm glad you decided
to get counseling.

287
00:16:02,142 --> 00:16:03,208
It'll be good for you.

288
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:05,877
Yeah, thanks
for dropping by, guys.

289
00:16:07,413 --> 00:16:08,714
You're gonna be fine, brother.

290
00:16:08,716 --> 00:16:10,482
Yeah, mate, so are you.

291
00:16:12,218 --> 00:16:13,719
Get him out of here.

292
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,959
I am so sorry.

293
00:16:20,961 --> 00:16:22,828
- Morgan, do they know?
- No.

294
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:25,097
It's just...
It's been hard on them too,

295
00:16:25,099 --> 00:16:28,800
you know, watching me die,
and they sometimes stop in

296
00:16:28,802 --> 00:16:30,235
and just check and see
if I'm breathing.

297
00:16:30,237 --> 00:16:31,436
I still think that we should go.

298
00:16:31,438 --> 00:16:35,007
No, no, please, please,
I need your help.

299
00:16:35,009 --> 00:16:36,308
I'm begging you.

300
00:16:38,678 --> 00:16:41,613
Des, it's okay.

301
00:16:41,615 --> 00:16:43,315
It's okay. Look at me.

302
00:16:44,584 --> 00:16:47,119
It's okay.

303
00:17:06,472 --> 00:17:09,207
How are you feeling?

304
00:17:09,209 --> 00:17:11,576
Good.

305
00:17:11,578 --> 00:17:13,011
Weird.

306
00:17:13,013 --> 00:17:16,915
Feel like I'm standing
at the edge of a cliff.

307
00:17:16,917 --> 00:17:18,583
Does that make any sense?

308
00:17:18,585 --> 00:17:21,119
It makes a lot of sense.

309
00:17:21,121 --> 00:17:23,889
We have a few things to go over,

310
00:17:23,891 --> 00:17:25,824
and I have something
for you to sign.

311
00:17:27,327 --> 00:17:29,361
Des, the contract?

312
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:35,133
Des?

313
00:18:24,217 --> 00:18:28,120
These friends of yours...

314
00:18:28,122 --> 00:18:30,522
have you known them
for a long time?

315
00:18:34,227 --> 00:18:35,961
20 years.

316
00:18:35,963 --> 00:18:38,430
We went to high school together.

317
00:18:38,432 --> 00:18:40,899
<i>Misfits and losers, you know.</i>

318
00:18:40,901 --> 00:18:45,203
I guess we banded
together... literally.

319
00:18:47,907 --> 00:18:51,343
That's great.

320
00:18:51,345 --> 00:18:56,048
Such an important part
of life, isn't it?

321
00:18:57,517 --> 00:18:59,985
To have friends
you can count on.

322
00:18:59,987 --> 00:19:02,254
Mary...

323
00:19:05,893 --> 00:19:09,094
<i>Friends can be such a comfort
in a time of suffering.</i>

324
00:19:09,096 --> 00:19:10,662
What's she gonna do,
talk this guy to death?

325
00:19:10,664 --> 00:19:12,598
I don't know.

326
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:26,578
We hope that we can be as well.

327
00:19:28,448 --> 00:19:33,185
And we would be happy to provide
more counseling sessions

328
00:19:33,187 --> 00:19:34,753
<i>whenever you need them.</i>

329
00:19:34,755 --> 00:19:36,555
That's her cover story.

330
00:19:38,324 --> 00:19:39,691
Where is she going with this?

331
00:19:48,568 --> 00:19:51,136
That sounds great, um,

332
00:19:51,138 --> 00:19:53,905
<i>but right now,
I'm kind of tired.</i>

333
00:19:53,907 --> 00:19:57,376
Cystic Fibrosis flare-up.

334
00:19:57,378 --> 00:19:58,977
It happens.

335
00:20:16,262 --> 00:20:18,263
We can reschedule
your counseling session

336
00:20:18,265 --> 00:20:20,532
for another time.

337
00:20:21,834 --> 00:20:24,002
You should rest now.

338
00:20:29,009 --> 00:20:30,976
<i>Wait, wait, wait, wait.</i>

339
00:20:32,178 --> 00:20:34,079
- Please, wait.
- You know what, Des?

340
00:20:34,081 --> 00:20:35,981
I think it's really
unprofessional of you

341
00:20:35,983 --> 00:20:37,816
to come
to a counseling session high.

342
00:20:39,186 --> 00:20:41,086
The wire, he's taking
off the wire.

343
00:20:41,088 --> 00:20:42,688
Frank!

344
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:44,589
So maybe you should
just walk home

345
00:20:44,591 --> 00:20:46,091
and think about
what you've done.

346
00:20:46,093 --> 00:20:47,626
I'm a bastard, okay?

347
00:20:47,628 --> 00:20:49,327
I'm a bastard. Don't go.

348
00:20:50,697 --> 00:20:51,763
Don't go.

349
00:20:53,033 --> 00:20:54,033
Please.

350
00:20:59,305 --> 00:21:00,672
- You piece of shit.
- Frank!

351
00:21:00,674 --> 00:21:01,707
Frank, take it easy.

352
00:21:01,709 --> 00:21:02,708
Come on, man. Come on.

353
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:03,809
- Off, off!
- Get off!

354
00:21:03,811 --> 00:21:05,711
Back off! Off!

355
00:21:05,713 --> 00:21:07,479
- She made me!
- Of course she didn't make you!

356
00:21:07,481 --> 00:21:09,448
You're going down for this.

357
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:12,984
Fine, you can go ahead,
and you read me my rights?

358
00:21:15,021 --> 00:21:16,388
- Well?
- Come on.

359
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:18,190
Get the hell out of my sight.

360
00:21:18,192 --> 00:21:19,558
You can't arrest me.

361
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,960
- Get out of my goddamn sight.
- With pleasure.

362
00:21:27,533 --> 00:21:30,569
Do you realize...
do you realize how bad this is?

363
00:21:30,571 --> 00:21:31,737
Come on,

364
00:21:31,739 --> 00:21:32,771
I told you he was high,
all right?

365
00:21:32,773 --> 00:21:34,239
- You pushed it.
- I pushed it?

366
00:21:34,241 --> 00:21:36,174
No, no, no, you don't get
to put this one me, all right?

367
00:21:36,176 --> 00:21:37,676
You compromised this case
from day one.

368
00:21:37,678 --> 00:21:41,179
- That right?
- Remember that?

369
00:21:41,181 --> 00:21:42,786
You know what?

370
00:21:44,485 --> 00:21:45,951
You can do the debriefing
with Grant.

371
00:21:45,953 --> 00:21:47,252
Tell him whatever
the hell you want.

372
00:21:47,254 --> 00:21:48,286
- I'm done.
- Frank...

373
00:21:48,288 --> 00:21:50,021
- No, I'm done.
- Frank, come on.

374
00:21:50,023 --> 00:21:52,057
I'm done.

375
00:21:58,664 --> 00:21:59,998
Jess.

376
00:22:02,335 --> 00:22:03,902
Hey, want to skip today?

377
00:22:03,904 --> 00:22:05,203
No.

378
00:22:05,205 --> 00:22:07,205
- We can go to the mall.
- I have money today for real.

379
00:22:07,207 --> 00:22:08,440
That's cool. Have fun.

380
00:22:10,309 --> 00:22:11,910
What?

381
00:22:11,912 --> 00:22:13,278
Why are you bailing on me?

382
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,748
- Because you're a psychopath.
- Jess.

383
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,650
Jess, I need you.

384
00:22:20,653 --> 00:22:22,053
I love you.

385
00:22:22,055 --> 00:22:24,790
No, you don't.

386
00:22:24,792 --> 00:22:27,225
Okay.

387
00:22:27,227 --> 00:22:29,661
Is that what this is about?

388
00:22:29,663 --> 00:22:31,229
You mad I'm not a dyke?

389
00:22:31,231 --> 00:22:32,998
Whoa.

390
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,833
I'm sorry.
What are you, embarrassed?

391
00:22:34,835 --> 00:22:36,635
Well, you should be.

392
00:22:36,637 --> 00:22:40,272
I thought we were
just having some fun.

393
00:22:40,274 --> 00:22:46,111
I can't believe you're ruining
our friendship over this.

394
00:22:46,113 --> 00:22:48,413
We could have been
like sisters, Jess,

395
00:22:48,415 --> 00:22:50,949
and now you're turning
into this selfish bitch.

396
00:22:50,951 --> 00:22:52,083
I'm a self...

397
00:22:52,085 --> 00:22:54,619
No, you are the most selfish
person in the world.

398
00:22:54,621 --> 00:22:57,155
I could search the whole planet,
and I wouldn't find

399
00:22:57,157 --> 00:22:58,657
a more self-absorbed
person than...

400
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:15,340
So, transfer her upstairs,
and if she's in a lot of pain,

401
00:23:15,342 --> 00:23:19,778
give her 50 milligrams
of morphine.

402
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:21,112
50?

403
00:23:21,114 --> 00:23:23,481
We want to ease her pain,
not put her in a coma.

404
00:23:23,483 --> 00:23:25,350
- Did I say...?
- Five.

405
00:23:26,485 --> 00:23:28,920
Hey, are you okay?

406
00:23:28,922 --> 00:23:31,523
Yeah, I'm...

407
00:23:31,525 --> 00:23:32,958
It's been a long day.

408
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,594
Hey, I've got something
that'll cheer you up.

409
00:23:35,596 --> 00:23:37,529
Did you hear about Matt Danvers?

410
00:23:43,003 --> 00:23:45,937
He woke up about an hour ago.

411
00:23:45,939 --> 00:23:48,773
We've been praying and praying,
even Dr. Taylor.

412
00:23:48,775 --> 00:23:51,076
It turns out I have a knack.

413
00:23:52,846 --> 00:23:54,946
I could see you waiting for me.

414
00:23:54,948 --> 00:23:58,183
I never lost faith.

415
00:23:58,185 --> 00:24:01,620
Wow, that's...

416
00:24:01,622 --> 00:24:04,656
That's amazing.

417
00:24:04,658 --> 00:24:06,391
And, Matt, you feel okay?

418
00:24:06,393 --> 00:24:10,095
It's all good.
It's a miracle, Mary.

419
00:24:10,097 --> 00:24:13,732
Well, Sonia, Matt,
I'm so happy for both of you.

420
00:24:13,734 --> 00:24:14,766
This is...

421
00:24:16,203 --> 00:24:18,503
Great, great news.

422
00:24:18,505 --> 00:24:20,105
Excuse me.

423
00:24:22,276 --> 00:24:23,508
Hello?

424
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:24,976
<i>Hello, Dr. Harris?</i>

425
00:24:24,978 --> 00:24:27,445
<i>This is principal Amelia Foster
from Westbridge Academy.</i>

426
00:24:27,447 --> 00:24:28,647
Is everything okay?

427
00:24:28,649 --> 00:24:30,315
<i>It's about
your daughter Jessica.</i>

428
00:24:30,317 --> 00:24:32,550
<i>You need to come
to the school immediately.</i>

429
00:24:32,552 --> 00:24:33,818
<i>We have a situation.</i>

430
00:24:36,322 --> 00:24:39,224
- My God, is that...
- What happened?

431
00:24:39,226 --> 00:24:41,159
Jess attacked Naomi.

432
00:24:41,161 --> 00:24:42,227
Is that true?

433
00:24:42,229 --> 00:24:43,962
- No, she hit me first.
- No, I didn't.

434
00:24:43,964 --> 00:24:45,463
- Why are you fighting?
- What's going on?

435
00:24:45,465 --> 00:24:46,531
They won't say.

436
00:24:46,533 --> 00:24:47,866
The most I could get out of them

437
00:24:47,868 --> 00:24:51,736
is that they were arguing
and then it got physical.

438
00:24:51,738 --> 00:24:55,106
Either way, we have
a zero-tolerance policy

439
00:24:55,108 --> 00:24:56,374
for violence at Westbridge.

440
00:24:56,376 --> 00:24:57,776
There will be consequences.

441
00:24:57,778 --> 00:24:59,477
Well, I don't think
that Naomi should be punished.

442
00:24:59,479 --> 00:25:00,712
She didn't instigate anything.

443
00:25:00,714 --> 00:25:01,947
Well, Jess said she did.

444
00:25:01,949 --> 00:25:04,182
- Well, it's hearsay.
- Are we in court?

445
00:25:04,184 --> 00:25:05,884
What is this? Come on.

446
00:25:05,886 --> 00:25:08,520
How about I talk?

447
00:25:08,522 --> 00:25:11,056
Given your daughter's
excellent records,

448
00:25:11,058 --> 00:25:12,624
I won't suspend them,

449
00:25:12,626 --> 00:25:17,195
but there will be detention,
after school for two weeks.

450
00:25:17,197 --> 00:25:18,430
That seems fair.

451
00:25:20,766 --> 00:25:23,401
Of course.

452
00:25:23,403 --> 00:25:25,904
Okay, Naomi, let's go.

453
00:25:33,779 --> 00:25:35,847
Jess, wait, I wanna talk to you.

454
00:25:35,849 --> 00:25:37,182
Just leave me alone.

455
00:25:37,184 --> 00:25:40,151
- Hey, slow down and look at me.
- Don't you get it?

456
00:25:40,153 --> 00:25:42,220
I don't want to talk to you.
I don't want to look at you.

457
00:25:42,222 --> 00:25:44,289
I don't... I don't want
anything to do with you.

458
00:25:44,291 --> 00:25:46,091
Why are you here?

459
00:25:46,093 --> 00:25:49,294
Because I want to help you,
because I love you.

460
00:25:49,296 --> 00:25:52,163
I'm so sick of people
talking about love

461
00:25:52,165 --> 00:25:53,865
when they have no idea
what it means.

462
00:25:53,867 --> 00:25:57,736
You know, if you love somebody,
you don't lie to them.

463
00:25:57,738 --> 00:26:00,538
You don't tell them
you care about them

464
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:02,374
when all you care
about is yourself.

465
00:26:02,376 --> 00:26:05,543
- Jess.
- No, just go.

466
00:26:05,545 --> 00:26:06,945
It's all you ever do anyways,

467
00:26:06,947 --> 00:26:10,482
and you know,
it used to make me really sad,

468
00:26:10,484 --> 00:26:13,385
but I don't really care anymore,

469
00:26:13,387 --> 00:26:16,421
because when you're around,
everything really sucks.

470
00:26:18,791 --> 00:26:22,293
Hey, hey, hey, Jess.

471
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:26,351
What the hell is happening
between you two?

472
00:26:27,801 --> 00:26:28,804
She hates me.

473
00:26:32,905 --> 00:26:37,008
Look, I know you've been
under a lot of stress lately,

474
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:38,810
and the financial pressure
I've put you under

475
00:26:38,812 --> 00:26:41,312
hasn't helped. I know that.

476
00:26:41,314 --> 00:26:43,548
That's all gonna change.

477
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:46,151
The house just sold
a couple hours ago,

478
00:26:46,153 --> 00:26:48,319
well over asking.

479
00:26:48,321 --> 00:26:49,954
So, I'll be able
to pay you back.

480
00:26:49,956 --> 00:26:53,591
You can pull back on your hours,
spend more time with the girls.

481
00:26:55,361 --> 00:26:57,195
Where are you gonna live?

482
00:26:59,832 --> 00:27:02,333
I'm moving in with Louise.

483
00:27:02,335 --> 00:27:03,334
What?

484
00:27:03,336 --> 00:27:05,703
I love her, and she loves me.

485
00:27:05,705 --> 00:27:07,172
Sometimes it can be that simple.

486
00:27:07,174 --> 00:27:09,274
I think it's too fast.

487
00:27:12,712 --> 00:27:14,679
Well, you know what?

488
00:27:14,681 --> 00:27:18,216
I never thought
I'd get here, but I did.

489
00:27:18,218 --> 00:27:21,219
Where? Get where?

490
00:27:21,221 --> 00:27:24,322
To a place where it doesn't
really matter what you think.

491
00:27:38,533 --> 00:27:40,835
Another setback.

492
00:27:40,838 --> 00:27:43,205
I understand
your frustration, sir.

493
00:27:45,174 --> 00:27:47,843
I mean, I've been on cases
that have taken months,

494
00:27:47,845 --> 00:27:49,344
if not years, so.

495
00:27:49,346 --> 00:27:51,012
And you've been given
every opportunity

496
00:27:51,014 --> 00:27:52,814
and every resource
for this case.

497
00:27:52,816 --> 00:27:54,082
I don't understand
what the problem is.

498
00:27:54,084 --> 00:27:55,617
I want answers about my son.

499
00:27:55,619 --> 00:27:57,352
Well, we are making progress.

500
00:27:57,354 --> 00:27:59,454
We have identified
another potential victim.

501
00:27:59,456 --> 00:28:00,622
The hospital records confirm

502
00:28:00,624 --> 00:28:03,658
that Annie Chung was
indeed his nurse.

503
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:07,562
However, the wife is a little
hesitant to cooperate

504
00:28:07,564 --> 00:28:09,264
with the investigation.

505
00:28:11,834 --> 00:28:13,668
We are close, sir.
We're very close.

506
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:15,070
We just need a little more time.

507
00:28:34,057 --> 00:28:36,391
Are you sure
you're alone this time?

508
00:28:36,393 --> 00:28:37,592
I'm sure.

509
00:28:48,872 --> 00:28:53,241
Not a bad way to go?

510
00:28:53,243 --> 00:28:58,713
Clean sheets, nice view,
free hair products.

511
00:29:02,085 --> 00:29:05,453
I always pictured drowning
in my own mucus in the ICU.

512
00:29:05,455 --> 00:29:07,322
This is better.

513
00:29:11,728 --> 00:29:15,263
You're quiet.
Is something wrong?

514
00:29:15,265 --> 00:29:17,899
Do you think the room is bugged?

515
00:29:17,901 --> 00:29:21,369
I'll need you to sign
this contract...

516
00:29:21,371 --> 00:29:23,138
- Okay.
- And do the statement

517
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:24,372
on camera.

518
00:29:24,374 --> 00:29:25,907
Of course.

519
00:29:25,909 --> 00:29:27,842
Um...

520
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:38,019
Do you find this hard?

521
00:29:38,021 --> 00:29:40,674
Bringing death to the decrepit
and vulnerable?

522
00:29:41,892 --> 00:29:44,050
I didn't before.

523
00:29:44,861 --> 00:29:48,964
What was hard was
watching people suffer.

524
00:29:48,966 --> 00:29:51,399
Nothing worse
than an undignified death.

525
00:29:51,401 --> 00:29:53,791
I guess the cops don't agree.

526
00:29:55,472 --> 00:29:58,206
What are you going to do?

527
00:29:58,208 --> 00:29:59,674
Come on.

528
00:29:59,676 --> 00:30:03,678
Safe to say I won't be
telling anyone your secrets.

529
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,900
This is supposed
to be about you.

530
00:30:08,051 --> 00:30:12,520
Honestly, you look like
you're in more pain than I am.

531
00:30:20,864 --> 00:30:26,501
I just... can't see
any way out of this.

532
00:30:26,503 --> 00:30:31,239
I mean, any way that doesn't
mean ending up in jail.

533
00:30:33,777 --> 00:30:36,811
But I don't know.
Maybe that's what I deserve.

534
00:30:40,817 --> 00:30:42,884
There you are. Where were you?

535
00:30:42,886 --> 00:30:44,552
How did you get in?

536
00:30:44,554 --> 00:30:46,288
- You gave me a key.
- You need to leave.

537
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:48,189
- I can't be around anyone.
- What's wrong?

538
00:30:48,191 --> 00:30:49,291
What's wrong with you, Larissa?

539
00:30:49,293 --> 00:30:50,592
You can't do better than me?

540
00:30:50,594 --> 00:30:53,328
- Stop it, Des.
- You need a daddy.

541
00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:55,797
I'm not your daddy.

542
00:30:55,799 --> 00:30:57,766
I don't need a daddy, asshole.

543
00:30:57,768 --> 00:30:59,768
Just take your things,
all your little things,

544
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:02,237
and get out!

545
00:31:02,239 --> 00:31:04,205
You're a jerk!

546
00:31:06,208 --> 00:31:07,242
I know.

547
00:32:14,044 --> 00:32:16,644
When I was younger,
I developed this obsession

548
00:32:16,646 --> 00:32:20,582
with medieval torture,
like the Judas cradle.

549
00:32:20,584 --> 00:32:21,883
Did you ever hear of that?

550
00:32:21,885 --> 00:32:23,918
No.

551
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:26,921
They sit you on this triangular

552
00:32:26,923 --> 00:32:31,626
metal point,
and you slowly become impaled,

553
00:32:31,628 --> 00:32:33,461
or they strap
you to the iron chair

554
00:32:33,463 --> 00:32:37,332
with hundreds
of tiny little spikes,

555
00:32:37,334 --> 00:32:39,834
or they tie you up
in the town square,

556
00:32:39,836 --> 00:32:43,705
and you die
the slowest death imaginable

557
00:32:43,707 --> 00:32:46,174
on display for the whole town.

558
00:32:46,176 --> 00:32:49,177
Nice.

559
00:32:49,179 --> 00:32:52,147
Why are you telling me this?

560
00:32:52,149 --> 00:32:57,252
Because in 100 years,
they'll look back at now

561
00:32:57,254 --> 00:32:59,654
and say that the most
popular form of torture

562
00:32:59,656 --> 00:33:04,325
was refusing to let people die.

563
00:33:04,327 --> 00:33:06,694
Dragging it out.

564
00:33:06,696 --> 00:33:10,565
Give people false hope,
false relief,

565
00:33:10,567 --> 00:33:13,301
hook them up to machines.

566
00:33:13,303 --> 00:33:15,236
Something that should
take months

567
00:33:15,238 --> 00:33:17,689
to kill them would take years.

568
00:33:20,143 --> 00:33:23,978
Those people?
They're the bad guys.

569
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:25,409
But you?

570
00:33:28,084 --> 00:33:29,553
You're one of the good ones.

571
00:33:31,721 --> 00:33:33,791
Do you really think so?

572
00:33:35,792 --> 00:33:37,228
Yeah.

573
00:33:53,843 --> 00:33:55,109
Wow.

574
00:34:01,183 --> 00:34:03,651
Are you going to stay with me?

575
00:34:03,653 --> 00:34:05,453
Yes, of course I will.

576
00:34:13,262 --> 00:34:15,763
Can you talk to me?

577
00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:31,946
You know, the first time
I did this, I was 16.

578
00:34:31,948 --> 00:34:33,330
It was with my mother.

579
00:34:35,418 --> 00:34:36,790
She was sick?

580
00:34:38,154 --> 00:34:40,127
Yeah, she was depressed.

581
00:34:42,425 --> 00:34:45,096
She wanted to die
more than anything.

582
00:34:47,163 --> 00:34:51,900
So each day I'd come from school
not knowing what I'd find.

583
00:34:51,902 --> 00:34:53,701
And my mother was good
at a lot of things,

584
00:34:53,703 --> 00:34:56,104
but she was terrible at suicide.

585
00:35:02,978 --> 00:35:05,179
Maybe there was something
holding her back.

586
00:35:05,181 --> 00:35:07,682
I don't know.

587
00:35:17,293 --> 00:35:19,561
At first, I...

588
00:35:19,563 --> 00:35:22,545
I tried to talk her out of it.

589
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,133
So many times.

590
00:35:27,336 --> 00:35:30,471
But after a while, I realized
that was never gonna work.

591
00:35:30,473 --> 00:35:35,109
Forcing her to stay alive
wasn't the way to save her.

592
00:35:39,548 --> 00:35:41,849
So I helped.

593
00:35:45,254 --> 00:35:48,903
She said she might
pull a Houdini,

594
00:35:50,594 --> 00:35:53,094
but I knew she wouldn't.

595
00:35:57,099 --> 00:35:59,629
I remember...

596
00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:02,971
the relief.

597
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:09,243
No more waiting,
no more wondering.

598
00:36:11,113 --> 00:36:14,716
And for a moment...

599
00:36:14,718 --> 00:36:16,951
everything was calm.

600
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:20,808
I was just thinking about you.

601
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:22,410
<i>Help.</i>

602
00:38:22,412 --> 00:38:24,312
- What?
- Des?

603
00:38:28,284 --> 00:38:29,484
<i>Des?</i>

604
00:38:31,221 --> 00:38:32,553
Des, talk to me. Are you okay?

605
00:38:32,555 --> 00:38:35,556
What's going on?

606
00:38:35,558 --> 00:38:37,061
<i>Des?</i>

607
00:38:50,221 --> 00:38:51,353
My God.

608
00:39:08,371 --> 00:39:11,674
Come on, come on.

609
00:39:11,676 --> 00:39:13,642
Come on.

610
00:39:13,644 --> 00:39:16,278
Wake up.

611
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:21,917
Stop. Stop it.

612
00:39:21,919 --> 00:39:23,552
- You stop it.
- Stop it.

613
00:39:23,554 --> 00:39:24,653
You don't get to do this.

614
00:39:24,655 --> 00:39:26,388
You don't get to call me
crying for help,

615
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:28,090
not after what you said.

616
00:39:28,092 --> 00:39:32,461
I know, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

617
00:39:41,037 --> 00:39:42,738
Tell me why.

618
00:39:45,942 --> 00:39:47,543
We had a fight.

619
00:39:47,545 --> 00:39:50,279
You weren't returning my calls.

620
00:39:50,281 --> 00:39:52,081
And that detective,
he said you were with Ben,

621
00:39:52,083 --> 00:39:53,415
and I got scared.

622
00:39:53,417 --> 00:39:56,018
You thought I would have
turned on you?

623
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:57,953
Well, maybe you should have.

624
00:39:58,408 --> 00:40:00,275
Let's face it, Mary.
I'm a liability.

625
00:40:00,277 --> 00:40:02,577
One way or another I ruin
every good thing in my life.

626
00:40:02,579 --> 00:40:04,479
Stop trying to make me
feel sorry for you.

627
00:40:04,481 --> 00:40:06,681
It's not gonna work.

628
00:40:06,683 --> 00:40:08,750
We're done, Des.

629
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,654
It's over.

630
00:40:14,657 --> 00:40:18,159
I need a partner
who can handle this.

631
00:40:18,161 --> 00:40:19,995
I can.

632
00:40:21,931 --> 00:40:26,267
I only started using again
because I felt so guilty.

633
00:40:29,138 --> 00:40:30,573
I'm done now.

634
00:40:32,209 --> 00:40:33,511
I promise.

635
00:40:35,212 --> 00:40:37,479
Des, I can't trust you anymore.

636
00:40:42,485 --> 00:40:44,886
I guess that's it then.

637
00:40:46,822 --> 00:40:49,290
I'll find a job
washing cars or something.

638
00:40:53,295 --> 00:40:55,563
Think you'd be my reference?

639
00:41:15,584 --> 00:41:17,786
It's a peace offering.

640
00:41:20,089 --> 00:41:21,656
I managed to pull
a few strings, man.

641
00:41:21,658 --> 00:41:23,792
We got a search warrant
for Troy Dixon's property

642
00:41:23,794 --> 00:41:26,494
plus a production order
for all of his financials.

643
00:41:26,496 --> 00:41:30,065
Yeah, how'd you convince him?

644
00:41:30,067 --> 00:41:31,299
Well, you know,

645
00:41:31,301 --> 00:41:35,394
I just flashed these
old puppy dog eyes on him.

646
00:41:40,142 --> 00:41:42,544
So, we're good?

647
00:41:42,546 --> 00:41:45,046
We're good.

648
00:42:31,762 --> 00:42:32,894
Did the owner check it out?

649
00:42:32,896 --> 00:42:35,396
No, said the Yukon
showed up overnight.

650
00:42:35,398 --> 00:42:37,098
Figured it was hot,
called it in.

651
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:40,468
- Lucky us.
- Maybe Sid's hiding out here.

652
00:42:40,470 --> 00:42:42,804
Living in a scrap yard?

653
00:42:42,806 --> 00:42:44,572
Maybe he ditched it and ran.

654
00:42:44,574 --> 00:42:47,242
There you go.

655
00:42:49,146 --> 00:42:51,279
God.

656
00:42:51,281 --> 00:42:54,449
- Jesus.
- Poor Sid.

657
00:42:54,451 --> 00:42:56,484
- Call it in.
- I'll check the vehicle.

658
00:42:56,486 --> 00:42:58,086
Yeah.

659
00:42:58,088 --> 00:43:00,655
Thanks for that.

660
00:43:00,657 --> 00:43:02,423
- This is Officer Hall.
- Need forensics

661
00:43:02,425 --> 00:43:04,959
at the scrap yard on West 15th.

662
00:43:04,961 --> 00:43:07,362
Got a 187.

663
00:43:07,364 --> 00:43:10,131
Look what I found.

664
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:19,407
Well, look who it is,
the angel of death.

665
00:43:19,409 --> 00:43:20,875
I'm here to talk business.

666
00:43:20,877 --> 00:43:23,300
Are you ready to give me my cut?

667
00:43:24,981 --> 00:43:27,081
I need a new partner.

668
00:43:27,083 --> 00:43:28,783
50-50.

669
00:43:32,347 --> 00:43:35,516
The two hour finale event of Mary
Kills People, continues now.

670
00:43:37,019 --> 00:43:38,713
The only crime that Mary is
guilty of

671
00:43:38,738 --> 00:43:40,304
is trying to protect me.

672
00:43:40,306 --> 00:43:41,339
Save me.

673
00:43:41,341 --> 00:43:42,340
She can't help herself.

674
00:43:42,342 --> 00:43:43,342
It's what she does.

675
00:43:45,246 --> 00:43:47,312
We're not the same you and I.

676
00:43:47,314 --> 00:43:49,248
You create pain.

677
00:43:56,924 --> 00:43:59,091
Help me please. He drugged me.

678
00:43:59,093 --> 00:44:00,659
He's going to kill me.

679
00:44:00,661 --> 00:44:01,460
Where are you?

680
00:44:01,462 --> 00:44:02,462
Mary?

681
00:44:04,031 --> 00:44:06,484
