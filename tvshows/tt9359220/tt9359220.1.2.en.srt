2
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,040
Oh, good. You're conscious.

3
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,640
Yeah, that's gonna hurt for a while.

4
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,040
But you're lucky.

5
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,240
Two inches to the left,
and you'd be on a life-support machine.

6
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:46,800
You were, uh...
quite insistent that I wrote this down.

7
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,680
I think you were a little delirious.

8
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,840
Turn around!

9
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,760
I'll check on you in a few hours.

10
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,440
<i>Are you okay?</i>

11
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,240
I'm fine.

12
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,120
Listen, Hemberg,
there's something you need to know.

13
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,520
The person who stabbed me
was the man in the black hood,

14
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,640
from Hugo's murder.

15
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,240
- Can I just speak to him?
- I'll be there first thing.

16
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,600
- Please, sir...
- Please, calm down.

17
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,040
- We'll go to the front desk and talk...
- Please.

18
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,120
But right now...

19
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,600
- Jasmine.
- We can't let you...

20
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,840
Kurt... W-What happened?

21
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,000
Uh, I-I don't know.

22
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,960
They're saying
Reza's in intensive care.

23
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:55,600
Please, tell him to let me through.
Please!

24
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,840
Oh my...

25
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,440
Oh, my God.

26
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,400
Oh, my God!

27
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,640
How did this happen?

28
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,880
Were you not with him?

29
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,000
We got separated.

30
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,120
<i>Kurt, a little help here, man!</i>

31
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,240
MAJOR CRIMES

32
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,160
All in one piece?

33
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,680
Just a scratch.

34
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,200
Talk me through it.

35
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,600
We were trying to hold the line
against the Norse Protection League,

36
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,680
outnumbered...

37
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,120
when I saw him,

38
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,320
the hooded man from Hugo's murder.

39
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,800
I left my unit...

40
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,840
gave pursuit on foot...

41
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,040
eventually cornered him...

42
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,320
approached to put the cuffs on...

43
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:18,120
and as I took his arm,
he swiveled around, stabbed me, ran.

44
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,320
Reza Al-Rahman's in intensive care
because of me. Because I left.

45
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,560
This job's full of tough choices, son.

46
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:42,640
Your boy Ibra is refusing to talk.

47
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,440
Friendly face might help convince him.

48
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:52,160
Superintendent Hemberg, you know how much
I appreciate the chance you've given me.

49
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,920
But I won't be able
to continue working on the case.

50
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,120
I've been attacked by a suspect. I can
no longer act as an investigating officer.

51
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,640
The internal team's
waiting for my explanation.

52
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,680
Think of the number of investigators
who've been attacked chasing a subject.

53
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,640
You think they all recused themselves?

54
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,960
It's the law.

55
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,120
What do you... How would I even...

56
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,560
You say what you need to say
to the investigating officers.

57
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,240
They conduct an investigation
that comes up short...

58
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,560
Are you asking me to lie?

59
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,800
It's time to ask yourself
how much you want to be a detective.

60
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,480
Your access to the neighborhood
is essential.

61
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,680
Sometimes rules need bending
for the greater good.

62
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,760
Nielsen and Edman are waiting for you.

63
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,400
So...

64
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,120
talk us through it.

65
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,200
I was with my unit.

66
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,240
Outnumbered, we understand.

67
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,720
What was it that made you leave your unit?

68
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,280
There was a man.

69
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,120
I saw him brandishing his knife.

70
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:47,120
He was approaching civilians
with what seemed like intent to attack.

71
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,400
So, concerned about civilian casualties,

72
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,640
I made the decision
to neutralize the threat.

73
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,160
Physical appearance?

74
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,240
- Can you describe him?
- Hm.

75
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,520
I'll try.

76
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:04,080
But it happened so fast, you know,
I didn't really get a good look at him.

77
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:10,600
But he was very average.
Medium build, medium height.

78
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,040
So, you're back
on the case. Good.

79
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,880
Don't look so worried.

80
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,800
I'm sending them to look
for someone that doesn't exist.

81
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,040
So they won't find him.

82
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,080
When you didn't see the guy in black,
where did he come from?

83
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,000
He was just there.

84
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,480
Go back to where you first saw him.
Might jog your memory.

85
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:22,160
We've all been working for hours
to get it to this state, but...

86
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,040
Here's this one.

87
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,040
Yeah,
seeing how much damage is there.

88
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,000
They got everywhere.

89
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,360
The shower units, the bunk beds.

90
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,280
- How was the location leaked?
- I don't know.

91
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,400
But at least no one was hurt.

92
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,880
Right. Gustav, we need to go.

93
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,080
Small matter of a board meeting.

94
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:46,040
- I believe it's in your calendar.
- Fuck going to that.

95
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,680
Mona understands.

96
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,400
Don't you?

97
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,800
I'll forgive you this once.

98
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,640
Fine.

99
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,360
And you're coming
to that gallery opening.

100
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,400
I don't take no for an answer.

101
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,720
Hi.

102
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,280
This isn't a functioning place of worship,
if that's what you're after.

103
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,280
We met at the rally. I'm a policeman.

104
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,560
You were, kind of, you know, insulting me.

105
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,560
I look different without the uniform.

106
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:28,480
Shame you couldn't protect this place
the way you did the Nazis.

107
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,760
If we only knew about the refugees here,
we might've been able to.

108
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,320
Giving police the location
of people in the country illegally

109
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,960
would... kinda defeat the object.

110
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,400
It's about that day. The rally.

111
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,360
I'm looking for someone and I'm...

112
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,640
wondering if he might've
come from in here.

113
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,880
Why would you think that?

114
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,400
The people that took refuge here
were evacuated,

115
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:57,000
- so I thought he might be one of them.
- Is he guilty of something?

116
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,120
Potentially.

117
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,000
What?

118
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,280
So you presume he <i>must</i> come
from a group of undocumented refugees?

119
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,080
That's not how I wanted it to sound.

120
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,400
I'm... I'm just covering my bases, really.

121
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:17,480
I'd say he's mid-20s, bright blue eyes,
dressed in black.

122
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,400
Doesn't really narrow it down.

123
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,120
- No?
- No.

124
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,960
You work here, right?

125
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,960
Only since recently.

126
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,160
So you must know these people.

127
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:33,000
The ones that come here anonymously
on the understanding they stay that way?

128
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,360
Yeah, not really.

129
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,680
Well, thanks for not insulting me
this time.

130
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,120
Um...

131
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,560
Are you bleeding?

132
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,520
Oh, shit.

133
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,360
Come with me.

134
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,680
You'll have to take your shirt off.

135
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,600
Right.

136
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,280
Don't worry.

137
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,080
She won't mind.

138
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,240
So how'd this happen?

139
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,440
The rally, funnily enough.

140
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,880
Oh, now I feel bad
for saying mean things to you.

141
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,160
Okay.

142
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,480
Hold it.

143
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,320
I'm no doctor, but...

144
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,280
how did the hospital let you go?

145
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,240
Listen, I'm sorry if it seemed like
I was stereotyping anyone.

146
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:08,280
After what happened to Hugo Lundgren,
we expect immigrants to be targeted.

147
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,200
More than usual?

148
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,280
More than usual.

149
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,200
Meaning they need
all the help we can give them.

150
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,440
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

151
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,000
You're all done.

152
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,520
Ready to fight crime.

153
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,720
This may seem like
an incredibly long shot, but...

154
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:56,280
I want you to know that if something
happens to occur to you...

155
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:00,040
my name's Kurt Wallander.
You can always call the station,

156
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,240
Malmo South and-and...

157
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,720
ask for me.

158
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,600
- I'm gonna go.
- Hm.

159
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,280
Bye... Kurt Wallander.

160
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,880
Bye.

161
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,120
I went back to where
I first saw the hooded man.

162
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,040
Mm-hm.

163
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,920
I spoke to someone at the church.
I thought he might be one of the refugees.

164
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,040
- Mm.
- But no one would confirm it.

165
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:41,240
Time to put some pressure on Ibra. You can
take the lead, now you're sticking around.

166
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,080
They have a day and a half
to charge you or let you go.

167
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,000
You, all right? Not "they."

168
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:49,320
Me-me. Yeah, the person around here
fighting your corner.

169
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,640
We're mapping out Hugo's movements
leading up to the explosion.

170
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,840
You had a fight.
You threatened to kill him.

171
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,960
<i>There's detectives out there right now
working on the theory</i>

172
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,800
<i>that you're connected to the hooded man.</i>

173
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:04,200
<i>By not talking,
it looks like you're hiding something.</i>

174
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,680
<i>Or protecting someone... like him.</i>

175
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,680
<i>Let's say you get charged.</i>

176
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,720
<i>Maybe it goes to trial.</i>

177
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,440
Maybe you get found innocent.

178
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,360
But do you think there's a football club
that will touch you after that?

179
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,600
After the headlines?

180
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,600
<i>Whatever you were really doing that night,</i>

181
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,440
<i>I promise you, it's not worth this.</i>

182
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,320
<i>Police remain open-minded</i>

183
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,840
<i>on whether the brutal murder
of Hugo Lundgren</i>

184
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,720
<i>was a terrorist attack.</i>

185
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,480
<i>But as yet,
no one has claimed the killing.</i>

186
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:48,680
<i>With one suspect in custody
and another at large,</i>

187
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:52,360
<i>the 17-year-old's death
has left a city gripped by fear,</i>

188
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,240
<i>anger, and demanding answers.</i>

189
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,400
<i>A police call for calm fell on deaf ears,</i>

190
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:01,560
<i>as Saturday's anti-immigration march
spiraled out of control,</i>

191
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,960
<i>leaving an officer critically injured.</i>

192
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,440
<i>Everyone, get back!</i>

193
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,480
<i>Get back! Get back!</i>

194
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,480
Ow.

195
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,880
Ah!

196
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,400
You like opera, Mr. Wallander?

197
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,280
I'm open-minded.

198
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,760
- Superintendent Hemberg...
- Hemberg!

199
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,880
Considerably fewer syllables.

200
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,120
Where are we on the grenade?

201
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:25,320
I don't know if I'm doing something wrong,
but I can't find a thing.

202
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,640
I went through every case Rask gave me.

203
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,040
What about forensics?

204
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,760
- Haven't got the reports in yet.
- What?

205
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,480
I'll chase it up.

206
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,440
No, I will.

207
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,880
Where we going?

208
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,200
The dead kid's parents.
Best take a look at their statement.

209
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,320
Hugo's parents say he was home with them

210
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,160
and wouldn't have gone out
on his own accord.

211
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,160
There's no evidence of abduction.

212
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:13,600
- So what happened?
- The mother knows something.

213
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,200
She seemed evasive during her interview.

214
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,960
You're gonna help me find out what.

215
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,480
Okay, cool.

216
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:23,920
How?

217
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,080
Detective Hemberg, can we get to it?

218
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:50,000
Is it, five, six times
we've spoken to you, your people?

219
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,880
You seem to forget that we're the victims.

220
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,600
It's, uh...

221
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,440
uppermost in my mind, sir,

222
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:01,960
but we're still trying to trace
your son's movements that night.

223
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,840
He played the match in Rosengaard,
came home,

224
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,560
ate supper, went to bed.

225
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,160
That's it. That's all we know.

226
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,760
It's just there are no signs of abduction,

227
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,640
so we have to conclude
that Hugo went out...

228
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,160
after you went to bed.

229
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,400
My son was up at 6:00 a.m. every morning.

230
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,480
Ninety minutes of training then school.

231
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,680
He was never anything
less than top of his class.

232
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,960
He was ambitious and disciplined.

233
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,520
Mrs. Lundgren...

234
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,480
is there anything
you can think of that might explain...

235
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:52,280
how Hugo came to be back in Rosengaard
at that time in the morning?

236
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,280
No.

237
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,320
Are you all right?

238
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,320
Detective Wallander
was stabbed at the rally.

239
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,760
Lucky to be alive.

240
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,360
Well, we all know who by.

241
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,840
- Rickard, please.
- Oh, what?

242
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,200
They're even attacking men in uniform.

243
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:17,880
Something's wrong with our democracy
when even free speech is under attack.

244
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,400
You see? He gets it.

245
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,880
Mr. Lundgren, all we want
is to find out what happened to your son.

246
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,400
Can you show me his room?

247
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,360
Thank you.

248
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,320
Shouldn't be at work really.

249
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,200
Should've seen his mother.

250
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,720
Terrified she'd lost her son.

251
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:58,080
More grieving mothers, more dead sons.

252
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,200
Unless we can get
to the bottom of this thing.

253
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,480
If there's anything,
anything you can tell us...

254
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,880
How's the investigation going?

255
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,080
I'm not at liberty to discuss it.

256
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,840
It's all right.

257
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,400
I've got a friend in SAPO.

258
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,640
I find stuff out from him
before it's even happened.

259
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,760
Right.

260
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:42,880
You were there.

261
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,080
You were with him.

262
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,400
At the end.

263
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,560
Yes.

264
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,400
Was he brave?

265
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,720
Sounds like a wonderful young man.

266
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,960
- I'm truly sorry.
- No, no.

267
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,080
Pity is for the weak.

268
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:08,520
You just make sure
you find the bastard that did this to him.

269
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,120
What did she say?

270
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,520
Hugo snuck out nights.

271
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,200
She didn't tell the father.
Thought he pushed Hugo too hard.

272
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,600
Does she know where he was going?

273
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,680
Nope.

274
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,320
But his friend Isak does.

275
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,480
Good.

276
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,680
All right. Keep it going, lads.

277
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,800
That's it, that's good. Nice and tight.

278
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:05,840
Good.

279
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,960
Quicker now. Pick up.

280
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,760
- You're Hugo's coach?
- Yeah.

281
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,800
Superintendent Hemberg.
This is Detective Wallander.

282
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,800
Can't be easy motivating your players
after what's happened.

283
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,920
No. Find it quite hard to motivate myself,
if I'm honest.

284
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,280
Football doesn't seem
very important right now.

285
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,160
We hear Hugo was tight
with a boy called Isak.

286
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,920
Yep.

287
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,440
Inseparable.

288
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,880
The kid's devastated.

289
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:44,840
Is he here?

290
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,920
Yeah, he's that one.

291
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,040
Now?

292
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,400
Isak!

293
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,920
Keep it going, lads.

294
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,920
Do you know
if Hugo had any connection

295
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,440
to this kid, Ibra, prior to the fight
at the football match?

296
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:06,600
No. No. I-I don't think
they knew each other.

297
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,560
Good. Looking good.

298
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,480
Hugo was my best friend...

299
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,800
since we were six years old.

300
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:18,400
So on the night of the murder,
do you know where Hugo was?

301
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:19,960
No.

302
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,560
He went home after the game.
I don't know.

303
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,960
I know there must be stresses involved
with being a kid your age.

304
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,560
I'm not gonna insult you
by pretending to know what they are.

305
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:34,880
Just gonna come out and tell you,
I <i>know</i> Hugo went out nights

306
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,240
to places he took measures
to prevent his parents finding out about.

307
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,040
Which means
you're not telling the truth, and...

308
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,080
I-I'd like to understand why.

309
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,560
I dunno what you're talking about.

310
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,840
What is it? The cube?

311
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,760
Yeah.

312
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,480
It's an optical illusion.
You know, like...

313
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:02,120
- see things from different points of view.
- So it's not <i>The</i> Cube? The nightclub?

314
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,640
Never heard of it.

315
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,520
Ex-girlfriend tried to make me go.

316
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,880
Did she?

317
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:15,320
Is this the kind of place
Rickard would want his son going to?

318
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,920
Uh...

319
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,920
It's what they call subversive.

320
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,840
Lying to the police,
what do they call that?

321
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:26,200
I-I should've said something.
I'm sorry.

322
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:32,320
I didn't want to change the way
they thought of him.

323
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,160
And honestly, I was scared.

324
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,760
I don't even know why.

325
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,240
But I swear...

326
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:44,120
So you were in The Cube the night
he was killed? When did you last see him?

327
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,840
I left quite early... maybe two?

328
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:50,480
- You left him in the club?
- He left himself there.

329
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,360
He liked disappearing in that place.

330
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,040
I swear, I don't know
what happened to him.

331
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,200
It's okay, that's good.

332
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,920
Mariam.

333
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,600
What do they want from me?

334
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,080
What does it mean?

335
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,880
What does what mean?

336
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,880
The police. Needing to interview me again.

337
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,360
When did this happen?

338
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,080
This afternoon. Detective Rask called.

339
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,480
I'm sure it's just procedure.

340
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,720
I apologize.

341
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,480
You're the one trying to help us.

342
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,120
No.

343
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,400
Take a seat. I'll make you some <i>malawah.</i>

344
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,920
No, no. You... It's really not necessary.

345
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:09,840
You have family?

346
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,480
I never see you with anyone.

347
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,720
Oh, not around here.

348
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:18,040
Closest thing to family I have
is my best friend who's in the hospital.

349
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,120
You cook?

350
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,320
I make a decent egg sandwich.

351
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,600
Do you wanna try?

352
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:44,920
I know you're dragging this out
just to make me feel like shit.

353
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,200
And guess what...

354
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,520
It's working.

355
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,880
But, for the sake of your family, Rez...

356
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,600
quit screwing around.

357
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,040
Wake up.

358
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,720
Hey.

359
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,880
My daddy's hurt.

360
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,120
I know, sweetie.

361
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,320
It's gonna be fine.

362
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:32,360
Mommy says he's sleeping. Is that true?

363
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,640
It's one hundred percent true.

364
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,560
You know what?

365
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:44,120
Your dad,
he is the strongest person I know.

366
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,320
Shaba.

367
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,760
I just need to talk
to your Uncle Kurt first.

368
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:14,000
The report says he's hurt
because you left his side.

369
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,160
Is that true?

370
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,840
Why?

371
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:32,440
I can't explain it right now.
It's an ongoing investigation.

372
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,800
Fuck an ongoing investigation.

373
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,080
We're family.

374
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,960
You know the explosion I witnessed?

375
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:53,760
I saw the prime suspect at the rally,
and I just couldn't let him get away.

376
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:59,840
Well, then notify someone whose job
it is to do that, and then you <i>do </i>yours.

377
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,360
I can't look at you.

378
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,960
- Just go.
- Jasmine...

379
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,240
Baby, let's go.

380
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,000
Wait, Ja-Ja-Jas!

381
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,320
Jas, wait!

382
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,720
I need your help.

383
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,280
<i>Bala caranishta.</i>

384
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,320
You know what it means?

385
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,760
<i>Bala chaara nishta.</i>

386
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,640
It means "no choice."

387
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,680
"I didn't have a choice."

388
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,680
Now you can make excuses in two languages.

389
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,160
- Bye, Uncle Kurt.
- Bye.

390
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,640
Morning, Kurt.

391
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,080
Morning, Detective Rask.

392
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,440
So, Ibra talked?

393
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,800
Gave his mom as an alibi.

394
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,880
Mm-hmm.

395
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:18,096
I thought you would have mentioned
something like that.

396
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,680
I deliberately didn't tell you.

397
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,360
Also known as doing you a favor.

398
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:28,680
I wasn't joking when I said
that you were compromised.

399
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,840
You care about the kid,
and you care about her.

400
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,240
I just want the truth.

401
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:36,040
Have you talked to her
about the state of the case?

402
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:40,960
What we know?

403
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,680
What this could mean for her son?

404
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,560
That's called conflict of interest.

405
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,440
This is a job with real life stakes, Kurt.

406
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:56,480
You break laws,
you tell lies, you get fired.

407
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,040
Or worse.

408
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,800
And I don't expect Hemberg
to explain that to you.

409
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,440
You're welcome, by the way.

410
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:31,840
Could you talk me through your movements
on the night of the murder?

411
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,680
Ibrahim was playing football...

412
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,360
when he had a disagreement
with that poor boy.

413
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:51,920
We went home.
I made him dinner. I went to bed.

414
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,400
<i>What about your son?</i>

415
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,800
<i>He was at home with me.</i>

416
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,840
<i>So he was at home with you all night?</i>

417
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,120
I think so.

418
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:12,440
"Think"? I thought you kept
a particularly close eye on him.

419
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:17,480
You cannot watch a child
every minute of every day.

420
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:23,600
Your son claims
that he was at home all night

421
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:27,080
until... the fire alarm went off,

422
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:30,440
and you woke him up and asked him
to go down and check it out.

423
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,640
Is that what happened?

424
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,760
I don't know.

425
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:43,360
<i>Did you wake up your son and ask him
to go down and check on the alarm?</i>

426
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,200
Please...

427
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:50,000
My son did nothing wrong.

428
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:56,400
You can confirm it or you can deny it,
but you can't do neither.

429
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,360
Look, he is a good boy.

430
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:04,120
I'm going to insist.

431
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,680
Did the conversation happen?

432
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,640
We have our answer.

433
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,480
Look, he would never hurt anyone.

434
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,880
<i>I don't see many like you.</i>

435
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:44,280
<i>Most people lie without a second thought.</i>

436
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:47,680
What does this mean?

437
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,640
It means he's hiding something.

438
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:00,280
Giving a false alibi. How bad is it?

439
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:03,840
We'll see what the prosecutor thinks,
whether it's enough to charge him.

440
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,320
Let's go.

441
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,280
If he's the commissioner,
why can't you meet at the station?

442
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,840
He insisted.
I'm asking myself the same question.

443
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,760
Mr. Commissioner.

444
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,840
Detective Superintendent Hemberg.

445
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,080
He's okay.

446
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,520
I hope this isn't about pressuring me

447
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,560
- to charge the Rosengaard kid.
- It's not.

448
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:07,080
When your office ran the search
for the Hugo Lundgren grenade,

449
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,840
the serial number flipped a switch

450
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:11,480
on a case that intelligence
had been building for months.

451
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:12,760
What kind of case?

452
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,160
Import-export route.

453
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:20,400
Former Yugoslavia straight into Malmo.

454
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,200
Weapons.

455
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,160
Amongst other things.

456
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,000
A few weeks back, our man in Bosnia

457
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,600
sent word about a shipment
coming in by boat.

458
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,480
A big one.

459
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,320
We took it down, but the boat was empty.

460
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,800
We concluded
that the intelligence was bad.

461
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,760
Till now.

462
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,480
Our grenade was part of the shipment.

463
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,080
So the intelligence was right,
but the boat was wrong.

464
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,480
What else was on the shipment, Tommy?

465
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:56,680
You didn't bring me here to tell me
about a delivery of Kalashnikovs.

466
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:01,960
Our source tells us of another shipment
about to arrive in Malmo.

467
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:07,040
Containing a metric ton
of Composition C-4.

468
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,840
Explosives?

469
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:12,200
Enough to blow us all
into the Northern Lights.

470
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,680
In the hands of someone who likes
to put grenades in people's mouths.

471
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,600
Is the C-4 a criminal case yet?

472
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,200
I want it.

473
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:28,160
Thought you might.

474
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:33,800
You have no idea
who is breathing down my neck on this.

475
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:38,600
It has to be swift, decisive,
and by the book.

476
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,760
You understand?

477
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:47,680
That C-4 needs to be found and seized.

478
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,640
Cross my heart and hope to die.

479
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,960
Send Katrin my best.

480
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:56,960
Same to Anna.

481
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,280
Oh, Jesus.

482
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,680
As if there isn't enough pressure already.

483
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,480
Yeah. Wait until you see
who's running the smuggling route.

484
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,200
Dodo.

485
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,360
Who's Dodo?

486
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,120
Eman Dodovic.

487
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:19,960
He immigrated to Sweden
in the mid-'90s with his then wife, Lejla.

488
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,520
Former Bosnian soldier,

489
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:26,240
he now runs a fairly robust
wholesale cocaine business.

490
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,400
Rumored to work directly
with South American cartels.

491
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,320
Expanded into weapons in the mid 2000s.

492
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,440
If we know all this,
how come he's still out there?

493
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,000
Dodo's sheltered behind
layers of legit businesses.

494
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:40,480
Restaurants, investment properties,
a taxi firm.

495
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,600
- We can't get near him.
- Hm.

496
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,600
Pull every CI we've got at the docks.

497
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:48,720
See if there's any whispers
on who picked up this shipment.

498
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,040
Wallander, with me.

499
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:52,520
Where are we going?

500
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,840
Ruffle Dodo's feathers.

501
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,000
- Good evening. Do you have a reservation?
- No.

502
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:20,000
Oh, at last. Hugo's toxicology report.

503
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:25,800
On the night he died,
he had ketamine and GHB in his system.

504
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:28,000
The GHB looks like a knock-out dose.

505
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,240
So it was spiked?

506
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:33,280
Yeah, but the ketamine
would've been recreational.

507
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,720
If he bought it at The Cube,

508
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,680
the dealer would've been
one of the last people to see Hugo alive.

509
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,640
You go there tonight.

510
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,320
- To The Cube?
- On-duty, but just to observe.

511
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,400
Look for dealers, be discreet.

512
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,560
Detective Superintendent Hemberg.

513
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:51,720
Eman. Fancy seeing you here.

514
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,800
How long has it been? Please, join us.

515
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:03,960
Premier detective
in the whole of Sweden.

516
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,080
What's up?

517
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,040
How's it goin'?

518
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,240
They're prescription.

519
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,080
Another water, please.

520
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:59,440
Do you know where I can get any GHB?

521
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:03,440
Or some K?

522
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:08,640
No idea, man.

523
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:05,680
Bash!

524
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:07,760
Bashir!

525
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,480
What is it with you, man?

526
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:21,520
You're fucking everywhere.

527
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:23,280
Is there somewhere we can talk?

528
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:25,320
It's important.

529
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
It's about Ibra.

530
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:29,880
Let him through.

531
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:15,360
What the fuck are you doing?

532
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:18,360
Can't protect you in here.

533
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:20,560
I don't need your protection.

534
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:24,120
Believe me, you do.

535
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:26,920
Ibra needs it.

536
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:31,880
Heard his mother ratted out her own son.

537
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:36,160
If you mean he lied
and underestimated her integrity, yeah.

538
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,000
This madness...

539
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:44,560
it worked out nice
for you though... Detective.

540
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:47,600
Tell the police where he was.

541
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:52,480
Ibra was your best look-out boy.
If your enemies came looking for trouble,

542
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,760
he'd get you the message
faster than anyone.

543
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:56,760
It's out of loyalty to you

544
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:59,480
that he won't say where he was
before the explosion.

545
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:02,640
He's sacrificing his future
for your code of silence.

546
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:06,040
He could be playing for Malmo.

547
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:07,520
Our agreement...

548
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:11,840
was that you keep your face
out of my affairs.

549
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:12,920
Mm-hm.

550
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:17,240
And in return,
I stop people kicking your head in.

551
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:21,920
Okay, I'm changing the deal.

552
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:24,560
If Ibra goes down...

553
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:26,760
you go with him.

554
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:32,240
Hey!

555
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:39,920
Why would they believe me?

556
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:43,440
'Cause guys like you never talk.

557
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:56,560
Hey.

558
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:01,680
Excuse me. Kurt, is it?

559
00:47:02,305 --> 00:48:02,901
