00:00:17,467 --> 00:00:20,737
If John here wanted you dead,
you'd be dead.

00:00:20,803 --> 00:00:22,672
Hello, Soren.
This is Kwan Ha.

8
00:00:22,739 --> 00:00:23,940
Nice of you to drop by.

9
00:00:24,007 --> 00:00:25,842
I've developed a new system

10
00:00:25,908 --> 00:00:27,944
which will overwrite
Spartan consciousness

11
00:00:28,011 --> 00:00:31,814
and replace it with our
artificial general intelligence.

12
00:00:31,881 --> 00:00:33,316
It's called Cortana.

13
00:00:33,383 --> 00:00:34,584
Didn't that process depend

14
00:00:34,651 --> 00:00:36,019
<i>on the illegal practice</i>

15
00:00:36,085 --> 00:00:37,620
<i>of flash-cloning humans?</i>

16
00:00:39,489 --> 00:00:41,624
- What does it do?
- I'm not sure.

17
00:00:41,691 --> 00:00:43,893
Slipspace vector tracking
on the Condor just came in.

18
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,496
We won't have his exact
location, but we'll be close.

19
00:00:46,562 --> 00:00:48,364
<i>What they did to us,</i>

20
00:00:48,431 --> 00:00:50,900
it's only permanent
if we choose to let it be.

21
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:52,602
That pellet you got
on your back,

22
00:00:52,669 --> 00:00:54,003
it mutes everything.

23
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:55,571
Lose the pellet

24
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:58,574
and it's like
opening your eyes.

25
00:01:01,044 --> 00:01:03,980
You bring it to life.

26
00:01:04,047 --> 00:01:05,448
What do you mean?

27
00:01:05,515 --> 00:01:06,649
You are different

28
00:01:06,716 --> 00:01:07,850
than the one they have.

29
00:01:07,917 --> 00:01:09,052
The one they have?

30
00:01:13,623 --> 00:01:14,957
The ring is what they want!

31
00:01:15,024 --> 00:01:16,926
- What is that ring?
- The end...

32
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:19,662
of life as we know it.

33
00:01:19,729 --> 00:01:20,997
I have to go back.

34
00:01:21,064 --> 00:01:22,899
You running back to Halsey.

35
00:01:22,965 --> 00:01:24,467
- You can't just leave me here.
- Promise me.

36
00:01:24,534 --> 00:01:27,003
- Keep her safe.
- I give you my word.

37
00:01:28,938 --> 00:01:31,607
- Why did you come back?
- There was no one I could trust.

38
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:33,609
You made the right choice.

39
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:37,080
<i>We're gonna do
great things together.</i>

40
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,775
<i>Metals and plastics</i>

00:02:05,842 --> 00:02:07,643
<i>are to be kept separate.</i>

<i>Contaminated bags

43
00:02:09,612 --> 00:02:11,013
<i>and extra shifts imposed.</i>

44
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,548
Come on,
let's go faster.

45
00:02:12,615 --> 00:02:14,584
Let's go,
you little bastards!

46
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:15,752
Move!

47
00:02:15,818 --> 00:02:17,487
Come on, let's go faster.

48
00:02:17,553 --> 00:02:18,821
Hurry up!

49
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:19,956
<i>"They ran among the broad</i>

57
00:02:41,778 --> 00:02:43,146
What's "untamed" mean?

58
00:02:43,212 --> 00:02:46,816
I think it's like
she's really pretty.

59
00:02:46,883 --> 00:02:47,817
You!

60
00:02:47,884 --> 00:02:49,519
Shh!

61
00:02:49,585 --> 00:02:51,687
<i> The next shift day</i>
<i>has been extended...</i>

62
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:55,525
Do you like it?

63
00:02:55,591 --> 00:02:56,692
I love it.

64
00:02:58,494 --> 00:03:00,963
It's a story about a whole
different world.

65
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:02,965
What do you mean?

66
00:03:03,032 --> 00:03:07,436
There are other planets
with bright light in the sky,

67
00:03:07,503 --> 00:03:08,738
and tall trees,

68
00:03:08,805 --> 00:03:11,474
and green grass
you can walk on.

69
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:12,742
I don't know.

70
00:03:12,809 --> 00:03:14,877
- Really?
- It's in the book.

71
00:03:17,213 --> 00:03:19,715
Look here. Do you know
what that word says?

72
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:21,050
"Kiss."

73
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:23,886
So, when you read
a word like that,

74
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:26,656
someone's supposed to kiss you.

75
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,802
Hey!

76
00:03:39,869 --> 00:03:41,070
Get back to work!

77
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:42,505
- Run!
- Let's go!

78
00:03:42,572 --> 00:03:44,140
Hey!

79
00:03:44,207 --> 00:03:45,608
Get over here!

80
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:48,911
Come back here,
you little shit!

81
00:03:52,648 --> 00:03:54,150
Makee, come on!

82
00:03:54,217 --> 00:03:55,585
Come on!

83
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:01,891
- Useless little shit!
- Stop it!

84
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:03,926
- Stop it!
- Forget it!

85
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:05,661
- Det!
- Let's go!

86
00:04:05,728 --> 00:04:06,963
No.

87
00:04:20,276 --> 00:04:21,744
Grab her!

88
00:04:25,214 --> 00:04:26,582
I've gotcha!

89
00:04:26,649 --> 00:04:27,650
Here come the Grunts!

90
00:04:27,717 --> 00:04:29,051
I'll teach you a lesson.

91
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:44,794
Mm.

92
00:08:10,973 --> 00:08:12,341
This is amazing.

93
00:08:15,344 --> 00:08:18,414
Finally, something
with potential value.

94
00:08:18,481 --> 00:08:22,051
Results confirm it's over
100,000 years old.

95
00:08:22,118 --> 00:08:23,886
That's pre-human.

96
00:08:23,953 --> 00:08:26,288
Possibly even pre-Covenant.

97
00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:29,125
It's organic,

98
00:08:29,191 --> 00:08:31,927
but with what appears to be
an inherent technology.

99
00:08:31,994 --> 00:08:33,462
According to Master Chief,

100
00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:36,298
it is something to do
with a weapon somewhere.

101
00:08:36,365 --> 00:08:37,967
We have no confirmation,
but Doctor...

102
00:08:38,033 --> 00:08:39,902
And why am I only
hearing about this now?

103
00:08:39,969 --> 00:08:41,237
- You know exactly why.
- I don't understand...

104
00:08:41,303 --> 00:08:42,972
And if it was up to her,

105
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:44,874
you still wouldn't know
anything about it.

106
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:47,176
Then why show it to me
in the first place?

107
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:50,112
I want you to lead a team

108
00:08:50,179 --> 00:08:52,381
in analyzing this artifact.

109
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:54,850
Determine what it is,
what it does,

110
00:08:54,917 --> 00:08:58,320
and if, in fact, it's part
of some kind of weapon.

111
00:08:58,387 --> 00:09:01,891
Or anything that can give us
an edge against the Covenant.

112
00:09:03,425 --> 00:09:04,527
Separate teams.

113
00:09:06,862 --> 00:09:07,997
Parallel teams.

114
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:11,901
Dr. Halsey won't like that.

115
00:09:13,869 --> 00:09:15,271
I'm interested
in finding a way

116
00:09:15,337 --> 00:09:18,874
to be less reliant on Dr. Halsey
moving forward.

117
00:09:18,941 --> 00:09:21,010
Can you help me
with that?

118
00:09:33,389 --> 00:09:34,957
- Thank you, Adun.
- Mm-hmm.

119
00:09:47,469 --> 00:09:49,004
How are you feeling?

120
00:09:53,309 --> 00:09:56,445
I'm assuming you cloned me
to obtain organs,

121
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:58,113
or at least
that was the intent

122
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,883
when I collected samples
of my various tissues.

123
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:03,052
I collected the samples.

124
00:10:03,118 --> 00:10:06,121
You are merely a product
of the samples.

125
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:07,990
Yes, a product.

126
00:10:08,057 --> 00:10:10,025
Well, it turns out
not to feel that way

127
00:10:10,092 --> 00:10:11,327
when you're sitting
in this chair.

128
00:10:13,062 --> 00:10:14,930
I have some questions.

129
00:10:19,401 --> 00:10:20,569
Go ahead.

130
00:10:22,238 --> 00:10:23,872
What became
of the children?

131
00:10:25,941 --> 00:10:29,311
Uh, well, 35 survived
the original augmentation.

132
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:31,280
So, more than half died.

133
00:10:31,347 --> 00:10:33,616
That's a far greater percentage
than I imagined.

134
00:10:33,682 --> 00:10:35,484
The rest became Spartans.

135
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:38,087
And now here I am,
conscious and conversing

136
00:10:38,153 --> 00:10:41,123
with the Sorvad solids
laid out before me.

137
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:45,160
So, the organ you're after
is my brain.

138
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:48,397
Or should I say,
your brain?

139
00:10:50,099 --> 00:10:51,967
I've perfected the process

140
00:10:52,034 --> 00:10:54,570
for real-time
neuroelectrical imaging.

141
00:10:56,005 --> 00:10:57,406
The Cortana system's viable?

142
00:10:57,473 --> 00:10:59,208
Mm.

143
00:10:59,275 --> 00:11:01,977
So you'll integrate her
into a working Spartan?

144
00:11:03,112 --> 00:11:04,246
That's next.

145
00:11:04,313 --> 00:11:06,615
I bet it's John.

146
00:11:06,682 --> 00:11:08,450
<i>He was the special one.</i>

147
00:11:11,987 --> 00:11:15,591
Yes, he got himself
into some trouble recently.

148
00:11:15,658 --> 00:11:18,327
<i>This is our only way
of getting him out of it.</i>

149
00:11:20,296 --> 00:11:22,064
He was always willful.

150
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,602
And none of this
bothers you.

151
00:11:26,669 --> 00:11:28,070
Should it?

152
00:11:31,173 --> 00:11:32,341
What about Miranda?

153
00:11:32,408 --> 00:11:33,642
Our daughter.

154
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:39,515
I think that we have
everything we need.

155
00:11:39,581 --> 00:11:41,717
Do you remember
when you were my age

156
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:44,620
and you weren't sure
whether flash-cloning

157
00:11:44,687 --> 00:11:46,689
would ever be made legal?

158
00:11:46,755 --> 00:11:49,258
And you wondered,
if you found yourself

159
00:11:49,325 --> 00:11:53,295
sitting opposite a living,
breathing version of you,

160
00:11:53,362 --> 00:11:56,632
would you actually be able
to go through with it?

161
00:11:56,699 --> 00:11:58,400
What happened?

162
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:02,471
Progress.

163
00:12:18,354 --> 00:12:20,055
This isn't necessary.

164
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:24,259
It's the only way to return you
to combat duty.

165
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:26,061
I'm a Spartan.

166
00:12:26,128 --> 00:12:27,730
They can't afford to keep me
off the battlefield.

167
00:12:27,796 --> 00:12:29,732
That's exactly
what I argued

168
00:12:29,798 --> 00:12:32,401
to get us
to where we are now.

169
00:12:32,468 --> 00:12:34,670
I don't need a babysitter.

170
00:12:34,737 --> 00:12:36,071
It's not a babysitter.

171
00:12:36,138 --> 00:12:38,140
This is an upgrade

172
00:12:38,207 --> 00:12:41,610
which will allow us
to analyze the artifact months,

173
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:44,380
years faster
than by traditional means.

174
00:12:44,446 --> 00:12:46,448
And, most importantly,

175
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:48,250
it will get you back
on the front lines

176
00:12:48,317 --> 00:12:50,085
where you belong,

177
00:12:50,152 --> 00:12:52,321
where you are so
desperately needed.

178
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,194
Let's get started.

179
00:13:31,427 --> 00:13:33,328
I'm afraid
we'll need you awake.

180
00:13:34,663 --> 00:13:36,732
But this will keep
your body still.

181
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:38,333
Will it hurt?

182
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,435
Oh, yes.

183
00:13:44,373 --> 00:13:47,142
You have the most
beautiful brain.

184
00:13:47,209 --> 00:13:50,145
Soon, you will be part
of something bigger.

185
00:13:53,282 --> 00:13:55,217
And better.

186
00:14:09,865 --> 00:14:11,300
- Ready?
- Mm-hm.

187
00:17:09,745 --> 00:17:11,313
Cortana?

188
00:17:25,027 --> 00:17:26,695
When the game is over,

189
00:17:26,762 --> 00:17:28,930
the king and the pawn
go back into the same box.

190
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:36,972
Hello, Dr. Halsey.

191
00:17:38,774 --> 00:17:41,510
It is so good
to finally meet you.

192
00:17:43,512 --> 00:17:45,347
That must be the Master Chief.

193
00:17:45,414 --> 00:17:46,715
Yes.

194
00:17:46,782 --> 00:17:48,483
His military record
is outstanding.

195
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:51,787
Above the rest in strength,
stamina,

196
00:17:51,853 --> 00:17:53,588
and good instincts.

197
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:56,425
A natural leader.
I see why you chose him.

198
00:17:56,491 --> 00:17:59,695
Cortana,
in the B-19 sub-stack

199
00:17:59,761 --> 00:18:01,496
of the lab's central repository,

200
00:18:01,563 --> 00:18:03,999
you'll find information
regarding an artifact

201
00:18:04,066 --> 00:18:05,567
that was found
on the planet Madrigal.

202
00:18:05,634 --> 00:18:07,836
I have it.

203
00:18:07,903 --> 00:18:09,938
I'm planning some experiments
to find out more

204
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:12,641
about its provenance
and functionality,

205
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:15,877
and I need you to process
that data in real time...

206
00:18:15,944 --> 00:18:17,713
Doctor, there's a problem.

207
00:18:17,779 --> 00:18:20,082
My neural implant
is operating perfectly,

208
00:18:20,148 --> 00:18:22,684
but I'm unable to take
full operational control

209
00:18:22,751 --> 00:18:23,952
of the subject.

210
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:25,487
Yes.

211
00:18:25,554 --> 00:18:27,756
For the moment,
I have limited your access

212
00:18:27,823 --> 00:18:29,391
to the reticular formation.

213
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:31,026
More of an on/off switch.

214
00:18:31,093 --> 00:18:33,662
My directive is to integrate
fully with the Master Chief,

215
00:18:33,729 --> 00:18:35,797
to optimize both his physical
and his mental performance.

216
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:38,700
And in time you will do that,
and much more.

217
00:18:38,767 --> 00:18:39,868
But...

218
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:44,806
why have you prevented me
from achieving my directive?

219
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:46,942
Because John
is a central part

220
00:18:47,008 --> 00:18:48,910
of the examination
of the artifact.

221
00:18:48,977 --> 00:18:51,546
Before I hand him over, I need
to understand how it affects him

222
00:18:51,613 --> 00:18:53,682
and how it might adversely
affect you.

223
00:18:53,749 --> 00:18:55,016
Doctor,
surely I can withstand...

224
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:56,785
He will be conscious
within the hour.

225
00:18:56,852 --> 00:18:58,920
Can I recommend
that you use this time

226
00:18:58,987 --> 00:19:01,957
to familiarize yourself with
the trove of human knowledge

227
00:19:02,023 --> 00:19:03,658
that's now available to you?

228
00:19:05,093 --> 00:19:07,863
What will I do with
the other 52.4 minutes?

229
00:19:09,197 --> 00:19:10,932
That's very impressive.

230
00:19:10,999 --> 00:19:12,701
Uh...

231
00:19:12,768 --> 00:19:14,569
Don't worry.

232
00:19:14,636 --> 00:19:16,838
I'm gonna keep you very busy.

233
00:19:57,846 --> 00:19:59,948
<i> ...first images</i>
<i>are coming in from Tantalus,</i>

234
00:20:00,015 --> 00:20:02,450
<i>which was completely wiped out
by Covenant forces...</i>

235
00:20:09,825 --> 00:20:11,159
- Hey!
- Hey.

236
00:20:11,226 --> 00:20:13,595
Where you goin'?

237
00:20:13,662 --> 00:20:16,631
<i>...futures sent markets rising,</i>

238

240
00:20:22,938 --> 00:20:24,739

242

245
00:20:34,216 --> 00:20:38,053
<i>As they say, we're all
in this together now.</i>

246
00:20:41,223 --> 00:20:43,158
What do we got here?

247
00:20:43,225 --> 00:20:44,960
A gift from a cargo ship
from Earth.

248
00:20:46,695 --> 00:20:48,163
How many of these we got?

249
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:49,764
Forty-two cases.

250
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:51,633
- Come. Come on.
- Fourteen?

251
00:20:53,969 --> 00:20:55,170
Take a case.

252
00:20:55,237 --> 00:20:56,805
On me.

253
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:05,513
I want to go back to Madrigal.

254
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,048
What?

255
00:21:07,115 --> 00:21:09,651
- No.
- Vinsher's taking over.

256
00:21:09,718 --> 00:21:11,720
I have to join
the resistance.

257
00:21:11,786 --> 00:21:13,588
Little girl like you?

258
00:21:13,655 --> 00:21:15,957
I'm not a little girl.

259
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:18,293
My family have been
on Madrigal

260
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,028
since before
it was even a colony.

261
00:21:20,095 --> 00:21:21,796
I promised John
I'd keep you safe.

262
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:24,566
I don't see any reason
to break that promise... yet.

263
00:21:24,633 --> 00:21:26,835
There are people still loyal to
my father in the capital city,

264
00:21:26,902 --> 00:21:28,069
I know it.

265
00:21:28,136 --> 00:21:29,237
Let them fight.

266
00:21:29,304 --> 00:21:30,805
It's none of my business.

267
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:32,140
I'm not asking you
to fight.

268
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:33,975
I just need a ride
and protection

269
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:36,144
until I find my people.

270
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:38,747
I am not interested
in playing bodyguard

271
00:21:38,813 --> 00:21:40,282
to the princess of Madrigal.

272
00:21:40,348 --> 00:21:42,150
Then give me a ship.

273
00:21:43,952 --> 00:21:45,220
Right.

274
00:21:45,287 --> 00:21:47,789
Don't turn your back on me,
asshole!

275
00:21:56,298 --> 00:21:57,999
You're emotional.

276
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:00,035
And, as a courtesy to John,

277
00:22:00,101 --> 00:22:02,237
I'm not gonna
crush your skull.

278
00:22:04,205 --> 00:22:07,075
Now, run on home
and I'll see you at dinner.

279
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:13,348
We're having chicken!

280
00:22:19,821 --> 00:22:21,323
So it's always on?

281
00:22:21,389 --> 00:22:23,625
She's always available
to you, yes.

282
00:22:25,894 --> 00:22:27,362
Would you like
to meet her?

283
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:29,698
Not particularly, no.

284
00:22:29,764 --> 00:22:31,199
Come on.

285
00:22:33,335 --> 00:22:34,369
Cortana.

286
00:22:38,673 --> 00:22:40,141
Hello, Master Chief.

287
00:22:40,208 --> 00:22:41,609
I'm Cortana.

288
00:22:44,846 --> 00:22:46,014
Looks like you.

289
00:22:46,081 --> 00:22:47,649
Kind of you to say.

290
00:22:47,716 --> 00:22:49,017
I'm designed
to look familiar,

291
00:22:49,084 --> 00:22:50,885
my voice and accent
to be pleasant.

292
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:52,754
I'm your built-in navigator,
battle strategis...

293
00:22:52,821 --> 00:22:54,289
How does it work?

294
00:22:54,356 --> 00:22:56,291
The system contains
a hollow particle exciter,

295
00:22:56,358 --> 00:22:59,327
which means she can appear
to you in any environment.

296
00:22:59,394 --> 00:23:00,762
So it answers
to my command?

297
00:23:00,829 --> 00:23:02,297
I see it as more
of a partnership.

298
00:23:02,364 --> 00:23:04,132
And when I'm not deployed,
where does it go?

299
00:23:04,199 --> 00:23:06,201
Doctor, he must not be aware
what I'm capable of.

300
00:23:06,267 --> 00:23:08,636
On and off the field of battle,
I can...

301
00:23:08,703 --> 00:23:10,071
Thank you, Cortana.

302
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:11,239
Oh.

303
00:23:13,108 --> 00:23:15,243
Well, it was a pleasure
to meet you, Master Chief.

304
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:17,846
I'll speak to you soon...

305
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,382
I guess.

306
00:23:23,852 --> 00:23:25,353
I don't like this.

307
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:27,655
Trust me, you will.

308
00:23:27,722 --> 00:23:29,090
She's going to enhance
your abilities

309
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:30,992
in the field
one hundredfold.

310
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:34,195
You are the best
we've got.

311
00:23:34,262 --> 00:23:36,765
She's going to make you
even better.

312
00:23:38,299 --> 00:23:41,403
This is a great leap forward,
for all of us.

313
00:23:53,782 --> 00:23:55,950
Acknowledged
and received.

314
00:23:57,819 --> 00:23:59,854
Yes, sir,
that is the drill status.

315
00:24:03,925 --> 00:24:05,794
Commander,
a slipspace anomaly

316
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:07,395
just appeared
on our starboard quarter.

317
00:24:11,399 --> 00:24:13,701
Covenant corvette.

318
00:24:13,768 --> 00:24:15,203
They appear
dead in the water.

319
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:16,938
No fluctuations
from repulsor engines,

320
00:24:17,005 --> 00:24:18,373
no sign of field atomics.

321
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,408
Minimal organic
heat signatures.

322
00:24:20,475 --> 00:24:21,943
And their weapons are cold.

323
00:24:24,813 --> 00:24:27,449
Open the artillery bay.
Bring us around 90 degrees.

324
00:24:27,515 --> 00:24:28,817
- Yes, sir.
- Prepare to fire.

325
00:24:34,889 --> 00:24:36,391
Forward gun is hot, sir.

326
00:24:36,458 --> 00:24:38,793
Communication incoming, sir.

327
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:40,261
They're hailing us?

328
00:24:40,328 --> 00:24:43,131
Civilian emergency channel, sir.
One-six.

329
00:24:43,198 --> 00:24:45,266
Put it on the horn.

330
00:24:45,333 --> 00:24:47,168
Yes, sir.

331
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:49,404
<i> I don't know how</i>
<i>much longer I can survive here.</i>

332
00:24:49,471 --> 00:24:51,339
<i>Hello? Can you hear me?</i>

333
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:53,274
<i>Anyone out there?</i>

334
00:24:53,341 --> 00:24:55,410
This is UNSC ship<i> Gladius.</i>

335
00:24:55,477 --> 00:24:57,045
Identify yourself.

336
00:24:57,112 --> 00:24:59,180
<i>Oh, no! I need help!</i>

337
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:01,416
<i>I'm from planet Circumstance.</i>

338
00:25:01,483 --> 00:25:03,017
<i>We were taken prisoner.</i>

339
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:04,886
<i>My family's dead.</i>

340
00:25:04,953 --> 00:25:07,021
<i>I only have my father's radio,
and it's dying.</i>

341
00:25:07,088 --> 00:25:09,124
How many onboard?

342
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:10,758
<i>I'm alone here.</i>

343
00:25:10,825 --> 00:25:13,294
<i>The aliens abandoned in pods</i>

344
00:25:13,361 --> 00:25:15,430
<i>when the engines failed.</i>

345
00:25:15,497 --> 00:25:16,898
<i>Please help me.</i>

346
00:25:16,965 --> 00:25:19,033
- Prepare a drone pod.
- Yes, sir.

347
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:22,337
Ma'am, we're sending you a pod.
Board it when it reaches you.

348
00:25:22,403 --> 00:25:23,972
<i>Do not bring any weapons
with you.</i>

349
00:25:24,038 --> 00:25:25,240
<i>Is that understood?</i>

350
00:25:25,306 --> 00:25:27,509
Yes, thank you.
Thank you.

351
00:25:27,575 --> 00:25:29,777
Please come quick.

352
00:25:29,844 --> 00:25:30,912
Thank you.

353
00:26:06,347 --> 00:26:07,549
I'm ready.

354
00:26:09,217 --> 00:26:10,818
Cortana?

355
00:26:10,885 --> 00:26:12,420
<i>I'm also ready, Dr. Halsey.</i>

356
00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:18,860
Okay, John.

357
00:26:41,616 --> 00:26:42,517
Where were you playing today?

358
00:26:59,267 --> 00:27:01,269
Go ahead, Cortana.

359
00:27:01,336 --> 00:27:02,470
<i>Putting him into stasis</i>

360
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:03,538
<i>to access the artifact.</i>

361
00:27:09,143 --> 00:27:12,113
<i>I'm now getting no readings
from the artifact at all.</i>

362
00:27:13,615 --> 00:27:15,016
That's fascinating.

363
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:19,487
Cortana, release him.

364
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:31,065
That was different.

365
00:27:35,603 --> 00:27:38,539
Okay, John, we're going to let
your vitals return to normal.

366
00:27:38,606 --> 00:27:40,675
Just give us a moment
to go through the data.

367
00:27:44,078 --> 00:27:46,047
<i>Dr. Halsey, if you gave me</i>

368
00:27:46,114 --> 00:27:47,915
<i>full control
of the subject now,</i>

369
00:27:47,982 --> 00:27:49,183
<i>my readings
will be more accurate.</i>

370
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:50,618
It's unclear
why the artifact

371
00:27:50,685 --> 00:27:53,187
responds only to John as John,
but it does.

372
00:27:53,254 --> 00:27:55,189
<i>I was not designed
to be an assistant.</i>

373
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:58,326
You were designed
to follow my orders.

374
00:27:58,393 --> 00:28:01,596
I'm not going to risk
our ability to interact with it.

375
00:28:03,031 --> 00:28:04,132
Are we done?

376
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:33,628
<i>Docking complete.</i>

377
00:28:44,305 --> 00:28:45,473
Step out.

378
00:28:52,447 --> 00:28:53,648
Get on the ground.

379
00:28:57,118 --> 00:28:58,519
Search.

380
00:29:06,794 --> 00:29:07,729
Clean.

381
00:29:09,464 --> 00:29:10,598
Did they hurt you?

382
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:13,768
No, I...

383
00:29:15,103 --> 00:29:16,537
I'm okay.

384
00:29:16,604 --> 00:29:18,005
Stand, please.

385
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:24,746
Welcome.

386
00:29:28,783 --> 00:29:30,118
Thank you.

387
00:29:33,488 --> 00:29:35,490
Christ! It's those crabs!

388
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:38,793
- Seal the doors!
- No!

389
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:41,796
They're in the walls!
Goddamn it!

390
00:29:55,276 --> 00:29:56,344
Fall back!

391
00:29:57,779 --> 00:29:58,713
Go, go! Get back!

392
00:30:05,153 --> 00:30:06,721
<i>Come in. Please respond.</i>

393
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:13,628
<i>Commencing core protocol.</i>

394
00:30:24,539 --> 00:30:27,408
Where did the Demon
take my keystone?

395
00:30:27,475 --> 00:30:29,644
I don't know
what you're talking about.

396
00:30:35,683 --> 00:30:37,218
Where is your home base?

397
00:30:38,352 --> 00:30:40,855
I will tell you nothing,

398
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:44,091
and you won't find anything
on our ship to lead you there.

399
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:46,527
Humans.

400
00:30:48,529 --> 00:30:50,565
Just as ugly as I remember.

401
00:31:17,859 --> 00:31:20,194
Left, right, left.
Hustle!

402
00:31:21,596 --> 00:31:24,232
Come on, now!
You know it!

403
00:31:31,572 --> 00:31:32,640
Yeah!

404
00:31:34,375 --> 00:31:36,777
- Hey, Master Chief.
- Hey, Master Chief.

405
00:31:36,844 --> 00:31:38,312
Come on.

406
00:31:38,379 --> 00:31:40,681
Hey, look, look, look.

407
00:31:40,748 --> 00:31:41,916
Let's go!

408
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:43,918
He's back.

409
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:54,729
Apple, key, longsword,
justice-Mandarin, banshee,

410
00:31:54,795 --> 00:31:58,599
flower, character-Russian, pig,
house, honor-Arabic, Goa, Earth.

411
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,209
Ongoing, ziggurat, Meg,

412
00:32:08,276 --> 00:32:09,577
scarab, noun, scene,

413
00:32:09,644 --> 00:32:11,846
M-60 automatic,
infant, anterior.

414
00:32:11,913 --> 00:32:13,447
Form up.

415
00:32:21,556 --> 00:32:23,524
I've been cleared
to return to duty.

416
00:32:24,659 --> 00:32:26,227
If anyone has anything

417
00:32:26,294 --> 00:32:28,829
they'd like to ask
or tell me, please...

418
00:32:28,896 --> 00:32:30,798
We've been briefed, Chief.

419
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:33,801
We've been fighting together
since we were kids, Chief.

420
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:36,637
Whatever you do,
we trust you.

421
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:41,776
Very well.

422
00:32:43,678 --> 00:32:45,379
As you were.

423
00:32:45,446 --> 00:32:47,648
Hello, can I have your attention
for a moment, please?

424
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:49,684
- What are you doing?
- To those of you

425
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:52,453
who haven't heard of me,
I'm Cortana.

426
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,322
I'll be working
with Master Chief to provide

427
00:32:54,388 --> 00:32:56,691
logistical and tactical support
for Silver team.

428
00:32:56,757 --> 00:32:58,826
- No, I didn't summon you.
- Summon me?

429
00:32:58,893 --> 00:33:01,929
This is coming
from inside you, Chief?

430
00:33:01,996 --> 00:33:02,964
Go away.

431
00:33:04,332 --> 00:33:05,766
A.I. off.

432
00:33:05,833 --> 00:33:07,635
I'm introducing myself
to the rest of the team.

433
00:33:07,702 --> 00:33:09,503
Go. Disappear!

434
00:33:12,006 --> 00:33:14,642
I look forward
to working with you all.

435
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:20,915
New A.I. Halsey's.

436
00:33:23,718 --> 00:33:25,853
It's temporary.

437
00:33:38,032 --> 00:33:39,934
That's Hessiod.

438
00:33:40,001 --> 00:33:42,503
It's a big ball of gas.

439
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:44,639
And that one there
is Metisette,

440
00:33:44,705 --> 00:33:46,440
but no one goes there.

441
00:33:46,507 --> 00:33:48,676
I don't think
there's any air.

442
00:33:48,743 --> 00:33:50,811
How about Madrigal?
Can you see it?

443
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,715
It's right... there.

444
00:33:54,782 --> 00:33:56,417
I don't see it.

445
00:33:56,484 --> 00:33:58,052
Doesn't mean
it's not there, silly.

446
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:00,588
Kessler, time
to wash up, honey.

447
00:34:00,655 --> 00:34:02,423
You really
don't see it?

448
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:03,858
Kess.

449
00:34:03,924 --> 00:34:05,426
I'll show you later.

450
00:34:06,527 --> 00:34:07,962
Bye.

451
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:15,670
It's funny, I never look out
that window.

452
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:19,407
Why not?

453
00:34:21,042 --> 00:34:22,610
When you stare into deep space,

454
00:34:22,677 --> 00:34:24,679
you're seeing things
as they once were.

455
00:34:25,913 --> 00:34:27,782
I choose to live
in the present.

456
00:34:29,517 --> 00:34:31,552
- I can't stay here.
- Mama, come!

457
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,922
And if you go, and you die?

458
00:34:37,091 --> 00:34:40,594
The creatures who destroyed my
planet took everything from me.

459
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:43,364
Everything but my spirit.

460
00:34:43,431 --> 00:34:45,733
Every day that I live
in that spirit

461
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,435
is a victory over them.

462
00:34:47,501 --> 00:34:49,670
- Someday, you will...
- I'm not you.

463
00:34:49,737 --> 00:34:52,807
I can't just stay here
and eat and drink and smoke

464
00:34:52,873 --> 00:34:55,710
and pretend nothing else exists
outside that window.

465
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:04,418
I'm sorry you lost your planet,
but Madrigal still has a chance.

466
00:35:06,087 --> 00:35:08,589
If I don't try,
I couldn't live with myself.

467
00:35:10,091 --> 00:35:11,726
I'm going to fight.

468
00:35:13,461 --> 00:35:16,464
The universe will be diminished
without you in it.

469
00:35:31,445 --> 00:35:32,913
<i>Whatever you're searching for,</i>

470
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:34,081
<i>I can locate it.</i>

471
00:35:36,851 --> 00:35:38,619
Where are you?

472
00:35:38,686 --> 00:35:40,955
<i>I'm directly connected
to your auditory cortex.</i>

473
00:35:41,021 --> 00:35:42,623
Was I not clear with you?

474
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:44,558
Told you to leave me alone.

475
00:35:44,625 --> 00:35:46,827
<i>Yes, you've gotten quite good
at dismissing me,</i>

476
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:49,597
<i>but you're not as good
at targeting your search query.</i>

477
00:35:56,203 --> 00:35:57,972
<i>If I understand your objective,</i>

478
00:35:58,038 --> 00:35:59,774
<i>I can be helpful.</i>

479
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,742
<i>I'm actually quite good
at this.</i>

480
00:36:06,013 --> 00:36:07,581
<i>I'm listening.</i>

481
00:36:12,553 --> 00:36:16,690
When I touch the artifact,
I see things.

482
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:18,025
<i>What kind of things?</i>

483
00:36:20,561 --> 00:36:22,463
They feel like...

484
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:24,098
memories, I guess.

485
00:36:24,165 --> 00:36:26,700
<i>It doesn't help me
to hear what you feel.</i>

486
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:28,702
<i>What do you see, exactly?</i>

487
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:30,104
A picnic.

488
00:36:31,806 --> 00:36:32,940
A forest.

489
00:36:35,176 --> 00:36:38,579
A dog. My dog, I think.

490
00:36:38,646 --> 00:36:40,147
<i>Still not helpful.</i>

491
00:36:40,214 --> 00:36:41,849
<i>But based on the keywords
in your query,</i>

492
00:36:41,916 --> 00:36:44,218
<i>I find 103 human colonies
or moons</i>

493
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:46,921
<i>containing the specific flora
and fauna you are seeking.</i>

494
00:36:46,987 --> 00:36:48,656
<i>Would you like to see the list?</i>

495
00:36:48,722 --> 00:36:50,191
Yes.

496
00:36:50,257 --> 00:36:51,158
Please.

497
00:36:54,662 --> 00:36:56,564
I've been to some
of these planets.

498
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:59,600
<i>There were Spartan deployments
to 23 of these planets.</i>

499
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:02,903
Mamore.

500
00:37:04,205 --> 00:37:05,573
Mamore.

501
00:37:07,942 --> 00:37:10,177
We lost Nora 0-9-8
on Mamore.

502
00:37:10,244 --> 00:37:13,881
<i>Is the artifact bringing up
memories of Nora 0-9-8?</i>

503
00:37:13,948 --> 00:37:14,949
No.

504
00:37:17,685 --> 00:37:19,153
I remember losing her,
I just...

505
00:37:20,554 --> 00:37:21,689
<i>What?</i>

506
00:37:21,755 --> 00:37:23,490
I don't feel anything.

507
00:37:23,557 --> 00:37:24,925
<i>That's as it should be.</i>

508
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:26,627
<i>The hormonal pellet
in your spine</i>

509
00:37:26,694 --> 00:37:27,928
<i>suppresses adverse
emotional responses</i>

510
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:29,697
<i>and protects mission readiness.</i>

511
00:37:29,763 --> 00:37:31,899
<i>It's part of what
makes you a Spartan.</i>

512
00:37:31,966 --> 00:37:33,868
I know, but when I touch
the artifact...

513
00:37:36,103 --> 00:37:38,205
I don't just see those memories.

514
00:37:41,842 --> 00:37:42,943
I feel them.

515
00:37:47,882 --> 00:37:50,084
<i>Dr. Halsey, we have an issue.</i>

516
00:37:53,621 --> 00:37:55,856
<i>Master Chief,
what are you doing?</i>

517
00:37:57,925 --> 00:38:00,194
<i>Chief is trying to remove
his emotional regulator.</i>

518
00:38:00,261 --> 00:38:01,896
- Why?
- <i>I believe it has to do</i>

519
00:38:01,962 --> 00:38:04,098
<i>with the visions
he's been experiencing.</i>

520
00:38:05,633 --> 00:38:07,534
- <i>I can put him in stasis.</i>
- No, no.

521
00:38:07,601 --> 00:38:09,737
I want you to help him.

522
00:38:09,803 --> 00:38:11,939
<i>Removing his pellet is a direct
violation of Section Three,</i>

523
00:38:12,006 --> 00:38:13,107
<i>Regulations
on Spartan Behavior.</i>

524
00:38:13,173 --> 00:38:14,842
I'll take care of the pellet.

525
00:38:14,909 --> 00:38:17,544
It's better that he sees you
as an accomplice

526
00:38:17,611 --> 00:38:19,246
rather than a spy.

527
00:38:19,313 --> 00:38:22,149
<i> This is not</i>
<i>what I signed up for.</i>

528
00:38:25,619 --> 00:38:27,154
It'll be easier
if you let me help.

529
00:38:33,928 --> 00:38:35,229
Down.

530
00:38:35,296 --> 00:38:36,563
Down...

531
00:38:37,765 --> 00:38:39,900
left... there.

532
00:38:39,967 --> 00:38:42,903
Now make a 1.3-centimeter
vertical incision.

533
00:38:44,305 --> 00:38:45,606
Trust me.

534
00:38:48,375 --> 00:38:50,110
Good.

535
00:38:50,177 --> 00:38:52,746
You should feel something solid
at the tip of the blade.

536
00:38:54,181 --> 00:38:56,951
Twist 45 degrees
and use the knife edge to...

537
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:11,065
Thank you.

538
00:39:11,131 --> 00:39:13,600
Like I've been trying
to tell you, Master Chief,

539
00:39:13,667 --> 00:39:15,202
I'm here for you.

540
00:40:28,142 --> 00:40:30,244
You're okay.
You're okay.

541
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:52,132
<i>Welcome to Reach Transit.</i>

542
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:54,001
<i>Please advance
to the platform for boarding.</i>

543
00:40:54,068 --> 00:40:57,071
Cool beans! Oh,
it's my ball? Oh, my ball!

544
00:40:57,137 --> 00:40:59,740
<i>Chief, based on the readings
from your limbic system,</i>

545
00:40:59,807 --> 00:41:01,475
<i>this is a new experience
for you.</i>

546
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:03,177
<i>Let me help you.</i>

547
00:41:03,243 --> 00:41:06,747
<i>This train makes stops
at Reach Naval Academy,</i>

548
00:41:06,814 --> 00:41:09,183
<i>Tchakova Park,
and Manassas.</i>

549
00:41:09,249 --> 00:41:11,351
<i>Do you know
where you'd like to go?</i>

550
00:41:18,025 --> 00:41:20,394
<i>Next stop, Tchakova Park.</i>

551
00:41:20,461 --> 00:41:22,129
<i>Tchakova Park
is our next stop.</i>

552
00:41:40,948 --> 00:41:42,983
<i>Hola, chica.</i>

553
00:42:33,433 --> 00:42:35,435
Hey. It's mine.

554
00:42:38,071 --> 00:42:39,806
Thanks.

555
00:42:46,547 --> 00:42:49,550
<i> Is this why</i>
<i>you've removed your pellet?</i>

556
00:42:49,616 --> 00:42:52,019
<i>So you could
hear things differently?</i>

557
00:42:53,587 --> 00:42:55,822
Maybe I just wanted to hear it
like everyone else.

558
00:43:31,258 --> 00:43:32,526
Cortana.

559
00:43:33,961 --> 00:43:35,395
Cortana.

560
00:43:37,130 --> 00:43:38,565
- Can you open this?
- Why do you need to...?

561
00:43:38,632 --> 00:43:40,000
Can you open this?

562
00:43:40,067 --> 00:43:42,002
Open it, Cortana.

563
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:49,276
Chief,
do not touch the artifact.

564
00:43:49,343 --> 00:43:51,545
Each time you do, it stresses
your heart and nervous system.

565
00:44:01,989 --> 00:44:03,090
John!

566
00:44:04,491 --> 00:44:05,592
What did we talk about?

567
00:44:08,328 --> 00:44:09,363
I asked you what you're drawing.

568
00:44:14,001 --> 00:44:16,903
Let's have this be the end
of all this nonsense, John.

569
00:44:16,970 --> 00:44:19,439
Mom! I don't want to do it!

570
00:44:22,476 --> 00:44:24,911
Bury it, son.

571
00:44:24,978 --> 00:44:26,647
Another one?

572
00:44:26,713 --> 00:44:28,248
See how they go together?

573
00:44:31,652 --> 00:44:33,387
Ohh.

574
00:44:39,126 --> 00:44:40,927
There's a second artifact.

575
00:44:40,994 --> 00:44:43,463
- Are you sure?
- I drew it.

576
00:44:43,530 --> 00:44:45,198
Over and over.

577
00:44:45,265 --> 00:44:47,200
My mother was there.

578
00:44:47,267 --> 00:44:49,202
My father buried...

579
00:44:49,269 --> 00:44:50,370
I saw...

580
00:44:50,437 --> 00:44:52,172
I must have seen...

581
00:44:53,607 --> 00:44:55,342
What if the second artifact
is what we buried?

582
00:44:55,409 --> 00:44:57,010
Chief, your blood pressure

583
00:44:57,077 --> 00:44:58,512
is dangerously elevated.

584
00:44:58,578 --> 00:45:00,113
We need to return
to barracks right...

585
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:01,615
Ice rings.

586
00:45:01,682 --> 00:45:04,184
The planet that I lived on
had rings of ice around it.

587
00:45:04,251 --> 00:45:05,986
How many planets
have rings on your list?

588
00:45:06,053 --> 00:45:07,554
Seen from the planet's surface?

589
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:08,955
Yes.

590
00:45:09,022 --> 00:45:10,457
Only three.

591
00:45:12,092 --> 00:45:13,427
Show me.

592
00:45:21,668 --> 00:45:24,137
This is the place.

593
00:45:24,204 --> 00:45:25,672
I'm sure of it.

594
00:45:25,739 --> 00:45:27,307
<i>Eridanus Two.</i>

595
00:45:27,374 --> 00:45:28,975
But how could I have
been here?

596
00:45:29,042 --> 00:45:30,544
Eridanus is uninhabited.

597
00:45:30,610 --> 00:45:32,512
<i>It wasn't always.</i>

598
00:45:32,579 --> 00:45:35,415
<i>The planet was a select site
for the Reach for Life project.</i>

599
00:45:35,482 --> 00:45:38,452
<i>Reach for Life is an ambitious
feat of human ingenuity.</i>

600
00:45:38,518 --> 00:45:42,055
<i>Teams of UNSC biologists,
botanists, and geophysicists</i>

601
00:45:42,122 --> 00:45:44,157
<i>designed and built
the installation</i>

602
00:45:44,224 --> 00:45:46,526
<i>as a self-sustaining ecosystem.</i>

603
00:45:46,593 --> 00:45:50,330
<i>The goal: To seed life
on otherwise barren planets</i>

604
00:45:50,397 --> 00:45:53,266
<i>and hence to extend the reach
of humankind in the galaxy.</i>

605
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:55,135
I'm from here.

606
00:45:55,202 --> 00:45:56,536
<i>That's according
to the promotional material.</i>

607
00:45:58,071 --> 00:46:00,173
So this is where I lived.

608
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:03,143
<i>Based on your memories,
it's highly likely.</i>

609
00:46:03,210 --> 00:46:06,079
What do you mean,
"based on my memories"?

610
00:46:06,146 --> 00:46:08,081
Can't you just
check the records?

611
00:46:08,148 --> 00:46:09,483
<i>The operational files were lost</i>

612
00:46:09,549 --> 00:46:11,351
<i>when the program
was abruptly terminated.</i>

613
00:46:11,418 --> 00:46:13,286
Why? What happened?

614
00:46:13,353 --> 00:46:16,556
<i>A plague carried in on
an unauthorized transport ship.</i>

615
00:46:16,623 --> 00:46:19,426
<i>It spread quickly, killing off
most of the population.</i>

616
00:46:19,493 --> 00:46:21,328
There was no cure.

617
00:46:21,395 --> 00:46:23,263
What about my parents?

618
00:46:23,330 --> 00:46:25,098
<i>Survivors were evacuated
to Ehilend,</i>

619
00:46:25,165 --> 00:46:26,366
<i>where you were adopted
at age 6...</i>

620
00:46:26,433 --> 00:46:27,534
Cortana!

621
00:46:28,835 --> 00:46:31,671
What happened
to my parents?

622
00:46:31,738 --> 00:46:34,508
<i>In accordance with Emergency
Contact Protocol Upsilon,</i>

623
00:46:34,574 --> 00:46:37,043
<i>the planet was sealed off
to contain the virus.</i>

624
00:46:39,513 --> 00:46:40,680
<i>I have no other data.</i>

625
00:46:46,286 --> 00:46:48,522
<i>Oh. I'm sorry, Chief, I...</i>

626
00:46:48,588 --> 00:46:50,524
John, what's going on?

627
00:46:50,590 --> 00:46:51,725
Dr. Halsey.

628
00:46:51,792 --> 00:46:53,126
Why are you armored up?

629
00:46:53,193 --> 00:46:54,461
When I removed
my pellet,

630
00:46:54,528 --> 00:46:56,129
I realized that
an altered hormonal state

631
00:46:56,196 --> 00:46:57,764
might affect my interactions
with the artifact.

632
00:46:57,831 --> 00:47:00,267
- Removed your pellet?
- There are two artifacts.

633
00:47:00,333 --> 00:47:02,068
The one that I found
on Madrigal,

634
00:47:02,135 --> 00:47:05,138
and another one that
goes with it somehow, and...

635
00:47:05,205 --> 00:47:08,742
I saw it as a child
on Eridanus Two.

636
00:47:08,809 --> 00:47:10,544
Are you sure?

637
00:47:14,614 --> 00:47:17,250
The images that I've been
seeing...

638
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:22,122
they're memories.

639
00:47:22,189 --> 00:47:24,191
My memories.

640
00:47:24,257 --> 00:47:25,826
Of my family.

641
00:47:29,496 --> 00:47:31,665
We'll send some probes
to Eridanus Two.

642
00:47:31,731 --> 00:47:34,167
- We'll start a survey, and...
- No.

643
00:47:34,234 --> 00:47:36,436
- I'm going.
- No.

644
00:47:36,503 --> 00:47:38,238
Send a probe.
Stare at all the data you want.

645
00:47:38,305 --> 00:47:39,806
I need to see it for myself.

646
00:47:39,873 --> 00:47:41,441
John...

647
00:47:43,777 --> 00:47:45,779
I'll come with you.

648
00:48:01,328 --> 00:48:03,330
ECAM panel two.

649
00:48:04,664 --> 00:48:06,600
FMS? Where the hell is it?

650
00:48:06,666 --> 00:48:09,202
Ow! Damn it!

651
00:48:09,269 --> 00:48:11,338
Ow.

652
00:48:11,404 --> 00:48:15,742
These old birds, they're not
like the new UNSC ships.

653
00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:17,844
FMS is on the other side.

654
00:48:17,911 --> 00:48:21,581
I'm going to free Madrigal,
and you can't stop me.

655
00:48:21,648 --> 00:48:24,584
I could kill you for trying
to steal my favorite ship.

656
00:48:24,651 --> 00:48:26,386
That would stop you.

657
00:48:27,821 --> 00:48:29,422
Listen, Soren,

658
00:48:29,489 --> 00:48:30,891
if I can just find
my father's generals,

659
00:48:30,957 --> 00:48:33,193
I'll join the fight
against Vinsher.

660
00:48:34,361 --> 00:48:36,263
I... I have money.

661
00:48:36,329 --> 00:48:37,597
You got nothin'.

662
00:48:37,664 --> 00:48:39,165
My family is rich.

663
00:48:39,232 --> 00:48:41,167
- How rich?
- Deuterium rich.

664
00:48:43,370 --> 00:48:44,571
You think what's left
of your old man's army's

665
00:48:44,638 --> 00:48:46,706
got what it takes
to take on Vinsher?

666
00:48:46,773 --> 00:48:48,475
Not your problem.

667
00:48:48,542 --> 00:48:50,644
All you have to do is get me
to them and you get paid.

668
00:48:50,710 --> 00:48:52,512
Just like that?

669
00:48:52,579 --> 00:48:53,847
Just like that.

670
00:48:58,919 --> 00:49:00,854
Deuterium money, huh?

671
00:49:00,921 --> 00:49:02,589
I swear, you won't regret it.

672
00:49:02,656 --> 00:49:03,857
Oh, I know
I won't regret it.

673
00:49:03,924 --> 00:49:06,226
I'm gonna get paid
either way.

674
00:49:06,293 --> 00:49:08,261
If not from you,

675
00:49:08,328 --> 00:49:09,963
then from the bounty
on your head.

676
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:11,498
You get me?

677
00:50:07,754 --> 00:50:09,522
That's Sangheili.

678
00:50:09,589 --> 00:50:11,391
Fragments of the<i> Gladius's</i>
last transmission.

679
00:50:11,458 --> 00:50:14,327
Electromagnetic scatter
corrupted the signal.

680
00:50:14,394 --> 00:50:16,596
A.I.'s been able to partially
reconstruct it,

681
00:50:16,663 --> 00:50:18,398
so no idea
who's doing the talking.

682
00:50:18,465 --> 00:50:20,767
It's probably an Elite.
They run the show.

683
00:50:20,834 --> 00:50:22,669
Grunts are chatty,
but not over comms.

684
00:50:22,736 --> 00:50:24,404
So, what are they saying?

685
00:50:24,471 --> 00:50:25,672
I'll work on it...

686
00:50:25,739 --> 00:50:27,374
soon as I recover
from my system crash.

687
00:50:28,742 --> 00:50:30,744
- Power surge?
- No, it was after that,

688
00:50:30,810 --> 00:50:34,414
right about the time Parangosky
created parallel teams.

689
00:50:35,949 --> 00:50:37,651
Dr. Halsey's headed off
on a mission,

690
00:50:37,717 --> 00:50:41,488
away from Fleetcom
and away from the artifact.

691
00:50:41,554 --> 00:50:43,590
Keep your critical data
behind a firewall

692
00:50:43,657 --> 00:50:46,426
and use your time wisely.

693
00:50:46,493 --> 00:50:47,894
Got it.

694
00:50:53,033 --> 00:50:55,035
So, this is it.

695
00:50:55,101 --> 00:50:57,737
It's what Cortana
was able to generate

696
00:50:57,804 --> 00:50:59,572
based on John's description.

697
00:50:59,639 --> 00:51:01,875
You saw what the smaller one
was capable of.

698
00:51:01,941 --> 00:51:05,445
Can you imagine
the combined potential?

699
00:51:05,512 --> 00:51:07,981
You really think we'll find
the other piece on Eridanus?

700
00:51:08,048 --> 00:51:09,916
Or is John
just imagining it?

701
00:51:13,787 --> 00:51:15,722
<i>It's impossible to say.</i>

702
00:51:18,525 --> 00:51:21,494
<i>The mind is certainly capable
of invention.</i>

703
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:30,370
<i>Particularly when we're lost
in the dark...</i>

704
00:51:32,605 --> 00:51:33,673
<i>and desperate.</i>

705
00:51:43,950 --> 00:51:45,952
<i>But if we want to separate</i>

706
00:51:46,019 --> 00:51:49,456
<i>what's real
from what's imagined...</i>

707
00:51:51,691 --> 00:51:52,959
<i>we really have no choice.</i>

708
00:51:55,595 --> 00:51:58,364
We have to see
for ourselves.

709
00:51:58,431 --> 00:52:00,533
And if returning to Eridanus

710
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:03,403
brings back other memories
for John...

711
00:52:03,470 --> 00:52:06,740
<i>the truth could
bring us all down.</i>

712
00:52:10,510 --> 00:52:13,546
<i>That is what Cortana is for.</i>

713
00:52:14,305 --> 00:53:14,213
