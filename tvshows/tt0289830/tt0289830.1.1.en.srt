00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,097
GIRL (ALLIE): My mother
always talked to me

3
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:24,514
a lot about the sky.
(Subtitle Revised by HchC)

4
00:00:24,732 --> 00:00:26,771
She liked to watch
the clouds in the day

5
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:31,563
and the stars at night...
especially the stars.

6
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:34,528
We would play a game sometimes.

7
00:00:34,827 --> 00:00:38,112
a game called
"What's Beyond the Sky?"

8
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:41,829
We would imagine darkness
or a blinding light

9
00:00:42,168 --> 00:00:44,955
or something else that
we didn't know how to name.

10
00:00:45,338 --> 00:00:49,122
But. of course.
that was just a game.

11
00:00:49,342 --> 00:00:51,630
There's nothing beyond the sky.

12
00:00:51,845 --> 00:00:55,130
The sky just is. and it goes on and on.

13
00:00:55,349 --> 00:00:57,756
and we play all of our games
beneath it.

14
00:01:01,897 --> 00:01:03,973
Comin' in. twelve o'clock high!

15
00:01:04,192 --> 00:01:06,943
Tail gunner. get the bogey!

16
00:01:07,362 --> 00:01:08,939
Gunners...

17
00:01:09,197 --> 00:01:11,485
give 'em short bursts
when they're in range.

18
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,110
Do not waste ammunition.

19
00:01:16,955 --> 00:01:18,449
Watch out!

20
00:01:20,376 --> 00:01:22,949
Bandit, twelve o'clock.

21
00:01:23,379 --> 00:01:25,952
Watch out,
they'll come back around.

22
00:01:26,382 --> 00:01:28,458
There's one! There's one!

23
00:01:30,386 --> 00:01:33,055
- That was too close!
- Roger that!

24
00:01:35,016 --> 00:01:36,344
Nine o'clock!

25
00:01:38,896 --> 00:01:40,438
He's comin' around.
I'm on him!

26
00:01:40,856 --> 00:01:43,560
Come on. you lousy Kraut!
Come to papa! Yeah!

27
00:01:43,984 --> 00:01:45,182
Whoo! I got him!

28
00:01:45,403 --> 00:01:48,072
Nine o'clock.
keep your eyes open!

29
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:52,189
There's another one!

30
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:53,868
Whoo-hoo!

31
00:01:56,248 --> 00:01:57,658
Captain!

32
00:01:57,874 --> 00:01:58,988
What do you got, Toland?

33
00:01:59,209 --> 00:02:01,616
Lights... blue ones.

34
00:02:01,837 --> 00:02:03,165
- We see them. too!
- Holy Mary!

35
00:02:03,589 --> 00:02:05,332
- What the hell are they?
- Let's get a look at these.

36
00:02:05,758 --> 00:02:08,509
- Are they Germans?
- They're too bright. I can't see!

37
00:02:08,928 --> 00:02:10,470
Three bogeys. moving fast!

38
00:02:10,847 --> 00:02:13,598
Everybody keep calm.
We're gonna take care of this.

39
00:02:14,017 --> 00:02:16,223
- Bandit. twelve o'clock!
- F- 1s coming down on our left.

40
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:18,642
Head right. full throttle!

41
00:02:22,735 --> 00:02:24,312
- I'm hit!
- Oh, Christ! Russ!

42
00:02:29,742 --> 00:02:32,233
- We're losing altitude!
- We're losing engines!

43
00:02:32,453 --> 00:02:33,863
Co-pilot. take the plane!

44
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,072
- Co-pilot, take the plane!
- Yes, sir!

45
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:37,571
Captain Keys is on fire!

46
00:02:37,918 --> 00:02:40,076
Cover his tail!

47
00:02:40,295 --> 00:02:43,046
You hang on. Russ!
We're gettin' out of here!

48
00:02:43,465 --> 00:02:46,134
- We lost an engine!
- Shut it down!

49
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:50,091
They're comin' back!

50
00:02:50,306 --> 00:02:52,879
Christ. all around us!
Keys is going down!

51
00:02:54,227 --> 00:02:56,350
She's breakin' up!

52
00:02:57,606 --> 00:03:01,271
We're goin' down!
Get a parachute!

53
00:03:01,485 --> 00:03:02,683
We gotta get out of here!

54
00:03:03,111 --> 00:03:05,103
Let's go. guys!

55
00:03:05,322 --> 00:03:07,729
We've gotta bail out now!

56
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:09,942
Captain, we've got to bail out!

57
00:03:10,161 --> 00:03:11,785
I don't want to die!

58
00:03:11,996 --> 00:03:15,365
Trust me, Johnson...we won't die.

59
00:04:32,249 --> 00:04:34,288
ALLIE: Russell Keys
came home from the war

60
00:04:34,502 --> 00:04:36,293
like a lot of other soldiers.

61
00:04:36,504 --> 00:04:37,962
He was tired of fighting.

62
00:04:38,172 --> 00:04:40,378
and he was very glad
to be coming home.

63
00:04:40,592 --> 00:04:42,252
There were things
that had happened to him.

64
00:04:42,802 --> 00:04:44,759
and he knew that
he was not the same person

65
00:04:44,971 --> 00:04:46,631
he had been when he left.

66
00:04:46,848 --> 00:04:48,176
He had changed.

67
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,888
and he wondered about
all the things here at home

68
00:04:51,103 --> 00:04:53,391
that might have changed. too.
while he'd been away.

69
00:04:53,606 --> 00:04:55,978
But sometimes
when you go somewhere far away

70
00:04:56,192 --> 00:04:57,437
and then come back.

71
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,437
the part that bothers you most

72
00:04:59,862 --> 00:05:02,435
is not the things that have changed.

73
00:05:02,615 --> 00:05:05,236
but the way that other things
have stayed the same.

74
00:05:05,452 --> 00:05:08,025
like you hadn't been anywhere
or done anything at all.

75
00:05:08,455 --> 00:05:09,700
Hello, Mum.

76
00:05:11,834 --> 00:05:14,122
The kids would still play ball
on the vacant lot

77
00:05:14,545 --> 00:05:17,214
where he and his friends
had played every summer.

78
00:05:17,631 --> 00:05:20,122
The high-school band would
still play every Friday night

79
00:05:20,343 --> 00:05:22,134
in the park downtown.

80
00:05:22,345 --> 00:05:24,421
and old Mrs Parker
would still be waiting.

81
00:05:24,806 --> 00:05:26,466
as the kids
came home from school.

82
00:05:26,808 --> 00:05:30,011
to yell at them
if they stepped on her flowers.

83
00:05:30,228 --> 00:05:32,766
All of that might still be the same.

84
00:05:33,023 --> 00:05:34,433
but he was different.

85
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:36,856
and so nothing would really
be the same at all.

86
00:05:37,069 --> 00:05:38,777
- I know you will.
- Miss?

87
00:05:38,988 --> 00:05:41,739
Who do I talk to about getting
one of those G.I. loans?

88
00:06:01,679 --> 00:06:04,170
I remember the day
I proposed to your mother.

89
00:06:04,599 --> 00:06:07,006
I was nervous as hell.

90
00:06:07,227 --> 00:06:09,718
I can't picture anything
making you nervous.

91
00:06:09,938 --> 00:06:12,393
I had to walk
around the block five times,

92
00:06:12,691 --> 00:06:15,016
and then I walked
halfway home after that

93
00:06:15,235 --> 00:06:17,560
before I finally managed
to get my nerve up.

94
00:06:20,366 --> 00:06:23,901
Of course, I hadn't had
the life experience that you've had.

95
00:06:32,504 --> 00:06:35,077
- Dad.
- Hmm?

96
00:06:35,298 --> 00:06:38,085
My car looked real nice.

97
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:42,294
Well, we hid her
from a couple of scrap drives.

98
00:06:42,515 --> 00:06:44,223
Kind of unpatriotic, I guess,

99
00:06:44,642 --> 00:06:47,845
but we did our bit in other ways.

100
00:06:54,736 --> 00:06:56,396
Was it very terrible?

101
00:07:00,033 --> 00:07:01,693
Nah, it wasn't so bad.

102
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:08,785
RUSSELL:
What do you got. Toland?

103
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:11,535
Lights! Blue ones!

104
00:07:11,754 --> 00:07:13,378
What the hell are they?!

105
00:07:13,923 --> 00:07:15,962
(machine-gun fire )

106
00:07:16,802 --> 00:07:19,174
JOHNSON:
Captain. we've got to bail out!

107
00:07:19,555 --> 00:07:20,965
I don't want to die!

108
00:07:21,181 --> 00:07:24,764
Trust me. Johnson... we won't die.

109
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:34,190
ALLIE: They say some men

110
00:07:34,404 --> 00:07:36,859
carry their war with them
for the rest of their lives.

111
00:07:37,282 --> 00:07:41,576
and some men put it behind them
like an old pair of shoes.

112
00:07:41,787 --> 00:07:45,203
And then. I guess. there are
others who go on fighting.

113
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:48,582
even if they have no idea
who their fight is with

114
00:07:48,794 --> 00:07:51,997
or why it's so important
not to give up.

115
00:08:01,391 --> 00:08:03,597
MAN : Some people
will tell you the war was won

116
00:08:03,811 --> 00:08:05,009
by superior manpower.

117
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:07,428
Some people say that it was strategy

118
00:08:07,648 --> 00:08:09,308
or a just cause

119
00:08:09,734 --> 00:08:12,106
or the fact that
we're so damn tough.

120
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,351
None of that is true.

121
00:08:13,738 --> 00:08:17,522
What won the war was secrets...

122
00:08:17,826 --> 00:08:20,946
knowing theirs and keeping ours.

123
00:08:21,163 --> 00:08:23,736
Gentlemen, meet the Enola Gay.

124
00:08:26,669 --> 00:08:29,124
When the Enola Gay dropped
her payload on Hiroshima,

125
00:08:29,547 --> 00:08:32,120
only 1 07 men in the entire country

126
00:08:32,341 --> 00:08:34,464
knew what that specific payload was.

127
00:08:34,677 --> 00:08:37,298
The B-29 had been redesigned
to carry its load,

128
00:08:37,514 --> 00:08:41,642
and a new crew, selected
to carry an atomic bomb, was onboard.

129
00:08:41,852 --> 00:08:44,343
They were carrying out
a mission so secret

130
00:08:44,563 --> 00:08:47,018
that even they didn't know
what it was.

131
00:08:47,441 --> 00:08:49,683
The secret was kept
until the ultimate moment.

132
00:08:50,027 --> 00:08:53,562
As a result, the war was won.

133
00:08:55,199 --> 00:08:57,322
As members of the Intelligence Corps,

134
00:08:57,535 --> 00:08:59,990
it will be your job to keep secrets.

135
00:09:00,205 --> 00:09:01,782
Here at the 509th Bomb Group,

136
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:04,365
that responsibility
is made all the more awesome

137
00:09:04,584 --> 00:09:06,660
by the fact that we are
the only base authorized

138
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,289
to store atomic weapons.

139
00:09:08,505 --> 00:09:09,667
At any given moment,

140
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,755
your ability to keep your mouth shut

141
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:14,458
and, if necessary,
to lie through your teeth

142
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:17,300
may very well determine
the course of history.

143
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:21,675
Group, ten-hut!

144
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:24,267
We had 1 8 more sightings today.

145
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,640
Dancing lights, mostly.

146
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:30,274
The bulk of them
over the Pacific Northwest

147
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:32,942
and three, I think,
over the Great Lakes.

148
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:35,985
Something Russian?

149
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:38,533
I heard something on the radio.

150
00:09:38,746 --> 00:09:42,162
People were saying that they're
from another planet.

151
00:09:42,584 --> 00:09:44,909
We used to hear that
a lot at Los Alamos.

152
00:09:45,128 --> 00:09:47,204
We never knew if it was
something of ours

153
00:09:47,422 --> 00:09:48,964
or something
the Germans had going.

154
00:09:49,174 --> 00:09:52,874
That's right, Owen, I forgot.
You were at Los Alamos.

155
00:09:56,098 --> 00:09:58,386
We got a new mare in at the stables.

156
00:09:58,601 --> 00:10:00,973
I thought you might like
to join me for a ride.

157
00:10:01,396 --> 00:10:03,768
- I'd like that very much.
- Fine.

158
00:10:04,107 --> 00:10:05,980
Will you be joining us?

159
00:10:06,276 --> 00:10:07,734
No. She doesn't ride.

160
00:10:07,944 --> 00:10:09,687
Her constitution...

161
00:10:10,113 --> 00:10:12,236
it's a little too delicate.

162
00:10:14,952 --> 00:10:16,410
He's a bit of a bully, your father.

163
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:19,740
It's not personal.
He just--he's like that.

164
00:10:19,957 --> 00:10:22,661
Captain, are you gonna ride
or stand around yappin'?

165
00:10:22,877 --> 00:10:24,335
If he doesn't let you ride,

166
00:10:24,546 --> 00:10:26,834
how does he feel about you
going to the movies?

167
00:10:41,898 --> 00:10:43,308
Man named Kenneth Arnold--

168
00:10:43,524 --> 00:10:46,097
private pilot out of Boise
flying over the Cascades--

169
00:10:46,528 --> 00:10:49,564
says he saw nine
saucer-shaped disks in the sky.

170
00:10:50,824 --> 00:10:52,401
This is all over the Seattle papers.

171
00:10:52,826 --> 00:10:54,984
Wire services picked it up,
and they're running with it.

172
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:56,781
"And they're running with it, sir. "

173
00:10:56,997 --> 00:10:58,574
You don't want to forget
about the "sir."

174
00:10:58,999 --> 00:11:00,409
Some officers around here

175
00:11:00,835 --> 00:11:03,586
that can really get their shorts
in a bunch over that, Howard.

176
00:11:04,005 --> 00:11:06,128
Just something to keep in mind.

177
00:11:06,341 --> 00:11:08,049
What do you make of all this?

178
00:11:08,468 --> 00:11:09,582
Russians.

179
00:11:10,011 --> 00:11:12,383
Some sort of reconnaissance
coming over the Bering Strait.

180
00:11:12,597 --> 00:11:13,759
It has to be.

181
00:11:14,016 --> 00:11:16,767
You don't think we're being
invaded by Martians, then?

182
00:11:16,977 --> 00:11:18,803
No...sir.

183
00:11:19,021 --> 00:11:20,894
I don't.

184
00:11:23,484 --> 00:11:25,227
- WOMAN: I did.
- MAN: I thought it was swell.

185
00:11:25,528 --> 00:11:27,567
(thunder )

186
00:11:32,786 --> 00:11:33,984
WOMAN: Hey there, soldier.

187
00:11:34,204 --> 00:11:35,662
You looking for some fun?

188
00:11:35,956 --> 00:11:37,533
Not now, Sue. I'm on duty.

189
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:38,948
You look ready for action,

190
00:11:39,376 --> 00:11:40,953
but you don't look
like you're on duty.

191
00:11:41,378 --> 00:11:44,129
I'm meeting the colonel
to go over something.

192
00:11:49,053 --> 00:11:50,251
Sure you are.

193
00:11:53,517 --> 00:11:54,845
Call you later?

194
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:56,518
I won't be there.

195
00:12:04,987 --> 00:12:07,442
MAN: Welcome back
to KGFL studios

196
00:12:07,657 --> 00:12:08,855
in Roswell. New Mexico.

197
00:12:09,075 --> 00:12:11,862
It's a breezy July 2. 1 947.

198
00:12:12,078 --> 00:12:16,325
and here is Dinah Washington
with Stairway T o The Stars.

199
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:22,835
# Let's build
a stairway to the stars #

200
00:12:23,048 --> 00:12:28,837
# And climb that
stairway to the stars #

201
00:12:29,097 --> 00:12:31,884
# With love beside us #

202
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:35,884
# To fill the night with song #

203
00:12:36,104 --> 00:12:37,728
MAN :
... second season as manager...

204
00:12:38,273 --> 00:12:40,431
(changing channels )

205
00:12:46,824 --> 00:12:48,401
(static)

206
00:13:01,798 --> 00:13:02,912
Great.

207
00:13:03,133 --> 00:13:05,421
(engine sputtering)

208
00:13:13,478 --> 00:13:14,723
(sputtering)

209
00:13:14,938 --> 00:13:16,052
Damn it!

210
00:14:45,869 --> 00:14:48,111
(radio plays)

211
00:15:28,623 --> 00:15:30,033
Hello?

212
00:15:42,138 --> 00:15:43,846
Hello!

213
00:15:46,643 --> 00:15:49,015
Is anybody out here?!

214
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,482
(gasps)

215
00:16:30,941 --> 00:16:32,055
Aah!

216
00:16:57,845 --> 00:16:59,387
- (rustling)
- (gasps)

217
00:17:15,822 --> 00:17:19,357
We believe that what we saw
was God's angels dancing.

218
00:17:19,576 --> 00:17:22,909
That, or some new airplane
from White Sands

219
00:17:23,247 --> 00:17:24,741
gone out of control.

220
00:17:24,957 --> 00:17:27,495
You mentioned that you saw a crash.

221
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:29,164
Clear as day.

222
00:17:29,587 --> 00:17:31,045
If that was God's angels,

223
00:17:31,256 --> 00:17:33,877
then right now, they're
camped out about a mile and a half

224
00:17:34,301 --> 00:17:35,546
above Pine Lodge.

225
00:17:35,969 --> 00:17:37,961
(knock on door)

226
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,508
OWEN: Yes?

227
00:17:41,725 --> 00:17:44,429
Excuse me for interrupting, sir.

228
00:17:44,645 --> 00:17:47,930
There's a rancher just came
into the sheriff's office

229
00:17:48,232 --> 00:17:50,557
with something I think
you ought to take a look at.

230
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:54,817
Sue.

231
00:17:56,449 --> 00:17:58,240
I'm right in the middle of something.

232
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:00,243
I really need to see you.

233
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:02,031
And I need to see you.

234
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:05,125
How about if I give you
a call tonight if I can get away?

235
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,077
I want every bit of debris
out of this pasture

236
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:10,839
and back at the base.

237
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:14,251
All of your men are confined
to the base pending a debriefing.

238
00:18:14,469 --> 00:18:16,093
And that means the two of you.

239
00:18:16,346 --> 00:18:17,756
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

240
00:18:17,973 --> 00:18:20,724
- Any witnesses?
- Yes, sir.

241
00:18:21,143 --> 00:18:22,601
His name's Brazel.

242
00:18:25,689 --> 00:18:31,276
Sir, we'd appreciate your not
speaking to anyone about this.

243
00:18:31,487 --> 00:18:33,064
It's a matter of national security.

244
00:18:33,489 --> 00:18:35,481
It's from outer space, isn't it?

245
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:40,943
What crashed in that field
was a constant-level balloon train.

246
00:18:41,123 --> 00:18:42,747
And this is the material
out of which

247
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:46,369
the radar reflectors
on the train are made.

248
00:18:46,795 --> 00:18:49,546
If the Russians have figured out
how to build a bomb,

249
00:18:49,965 --> 00:18:51,542
we want to know about it,

250
00:18:51,926 --> 00:18:54,084
and this little spy balloon
will tell us.

251
00:18:54,303 --> 00:18:56,758
This is a project called "Mogul"

252
00:18:57,098 --> 00:19:00,798
and has a security
classification of A-1.

253
00:19:01,019 --> 00:19:03,142
Reporters are all over this.

254
00:19:03,355 --> 00:19:05,098
We're gonna have to
give them something.

255
00:19:05,482 --> 00:19:07,190
Somebody already has.

256
00:19:09,028 --> 00:19:11,697
MAN: With us this morning
in the KGFL studios

257
00:19:12,114 --> 00:19:14,687
is a local rancher who has
a startling story to tell.

258
00:19:15,118 --> 00:19:16,576
You found something
on your ranch.

259
00:19:16,995 --> 00:19:17,694
some kind of debris?

260
00:19:18,121 --> 00:19:20,279
RANCHER :
This wasn't just any debris. sir.

261
00:19:20,498 --> 00:19:23,119
This was some metal like
nothing I'd ever seen before.

262
00:19:23,543 --> 00:19:25,582
This was something
from another world.

263
00:19:27,548 --> 00:19:29,042
We've got
to shut this guy up, sir.

264
00:19:29,258 --> 00:19:31,334
We thought we'd let it go,

265
00:19:31,552 --> 00:19:33,260
divert attention from Mogul.

266
00:19:33,554 --> 00:19:35,961
You've seen the reports
on all these sightings.

267
00:19:36,182 --> 00:19:39,266
People are eating this up
with a spoon.

268
00:19:39,477 --> 00:19:41,600
I wouldn't recommend that, sir.

269
00:19:42,022 --> 00:19:43,302
Why is that, Captain?

270
00:19:43,523 --> 00:19:44,981
If we give our seal
of approval to this,

271
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,514
people are gonna believe it.

272
00:19:46,735 --> 00:19:49,107
You get a country that thinks
we're not in control of the skies,

273
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:51,611
you're inviting a major panic.

274
00:19:51,824 --> 00:19:53,863
Oh, really?

275
00:19:55,161 --> 00:19:57,237
Which do you like better
for the press release--

276
00:19:57,747 --> 00:20:00,368
"Flying disks" or "Flying saucers"?

277
00:20:09,051 --> 00:20:10,379
Is this for real, Captain?

278
00:20:10,594 --> 00:20:12,004
Those were pieces of a spaceship?

279
00:20:12,429 --> 00:20:13,923
No, it was ours.

280
00:20:14,181 --> 00:20:16,754
Spy balloon,
highly classified, A-1.

281
00:20:16,934 --> 00:20:18,392
That weird metal, all of that--

282
00:20:18,811 --> 00:20:21,053
Part of the project.

283
00:20:21,272 --> 00:20:23,395
Some flying saucer, eh, sir?

284
00:20:23,608 --> 00:20:27,392
This highly classified project
collided with something,

285
00:20:27,612 --> 00:20:29,022
that's how it crashed?

286
00:20:29,239 --> 00:20:30,649
I suppose so, yes.

287
00:20:31,074 --> 00:20:33,743
So what did it collide with?

288
00:20:38,624 --> 00:20:41,031
The advantage comes
through preparation.

289
00:20:41,461 --> 00:20:43,703
By the time your troop
goes out for its wilderness badge,

290
00:20:43,922 --> 00:20:46,247
you guys are gonna know
every inch of this ground.

291
00:20:46,633 --> 00:20:49,254
Isn't that kind of like cheating?

292
00:20:49,469 --> 00:20:50,797
Scouting is about attitude.

293
00:20:51,013 --> 00:20:53,586
You're gonna have to
do something about yours.

294
00:20:54,016 --> 00:20:56,388
We've done this weekend
14 times, Dad.

295
00:20:56,602 --> 00:20:59,093
Don't you think we're ready?

296
00:20:59,522 --> 00:21:00,932
You're ready when you know--

297
00:21:01,357 --> 00:21:04,441
when you absolutely
know your ground, okay?

298
00:21:04,652 --> 00:21:08,151
When you can be sure
that nothing can surprise you.

299
00:21:12,661 --> 00:21:14,119
Oh, my God.

300
00:21:14,329 --> 00:21:15,953
RADIO:
Jackie Robinson continues

301
00:21:16,373 --> 00:21:18,911
to extend his consecutive game
hitting streak to 1 9.

302
00:21:19,335 --> 00:21:21,327
While Robinson will no doubt

303
00:21:21,546 --> 00:21:23,788
remain the centre of attention
in the National League.

304
00:21:24,215 --> 00:21:25,792
he's about to share the spotlight

305
00:21:26,009 --> 00:21:28,297
with Larry Doby.
another Negro who...

306
00:21:28,511 --> 00:21:30,088
Once you let them in,
there's no turning back.

307
00:21:30,514 --> 00:21:32,008
It's the end of the world
as we know it.

308
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:35,807
What do you guys make of all
this flying-saucer razzmatazz?

309
00:21:36,019 --> 00:21:37,762
I think the Russians
was giving us a buzz

310
00:21:38,188 --> 00:21:39,433
with some spy gadget,

311
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:41,932
see what all we got
out at the base.

312
00:21:42,151 --> 00:21:43,609
The hell with that. It was ours.

313
00:21:44,028 --> 00:21:46,020
We were testing something
to spy on them.

314
00:21:46,239 --> 00:21:47,353
Or maybe the Germans.

315
00:21:47,574 --> 00:21:49,068
I say it was the Martians,
pure and simple.

316
00:21:49,492 --> 00:21:50,902
The captain!

317
00:21:52,704 --> 00:21:55,824
Owen, I need to speak to you.

318
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:58,164
Sue, uh...

319
00:21:58,377 --> 00:22:00,535
Um, you know what?
Couple of minutes.

320
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,374
- Marty.
- Yes, sir.

321
00:22:07,637 --> 00:22:09,095
That woman I just nodded to--

322
00:22:09,305 --> 00:22:10,336
give me a couple of minutes,

323
00:22:10,557 --> 00:22:12,181
then go tell her I was
called away on an emergency

324
00:22:12,601 --> 00:22:13,881
and I won't be back today.

325
00:22:14,311 --> 00:22:17,846
And, Marty, she's gonna
know you're lying,

326
00:22:18,065 --> 00:22:20,104
so try to sound
as sincere as possible.

327
00:22:20,317 --> 00:22:21,479
Yes, sir.

328
00:22:27,617 --> 00:22:29,194
MARTY: Excuse me, Miss.

329
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:31,034
I'm sorry, but the captain's
been called away.

330
00:22:31,454 --> 00:22:32,616
You're welcome to wait,

331
00:22:32,956 --> 00:22:34,616
but he may not
be back for a while.

332
00:22:36,418 --> 00:22:39,205
Excuse me. Are you the people
we talk to about flying saucers?

333
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:41,338
There's someone who can
help you down the hall.

334
00:22:41,757 --> 00:22:43,299
My boys and l
have some information.

335
00:22:43,717 --> 00:22:44,416
Down the hall.

336
00:22:44,844 --> 00:22:47,002
BOY: But we know
where one crashed.

337
00:22:51,017 --> 00:22:52,427
I was out with the boys,

338
00:22:52,727 --> 00:22:55,431
doing a little practice
for their wilderness outing--

339
00:22:55,647 --> 00:22:57,556
BOY: Which we think
is kind of cheating.

340
00:22:57,774 --> 00:23:00,229
Knowing as much as possible
beforehand is not cheating.

341
00:23:00,444 --> 00:23:02,567
- It's being prepared.
- Thank you, Captain.

342
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:04,938
We were just coming up
over this rise.

343
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,006
It's a real one, isn't it, sir?

344
00:25:42,201 --> 00:25:44,905
Most people
change kind of slowly.

345
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:47,369
They're who they are.
and then after a while.

346
00:25:47,582 --> 00:25:49,574
they're someone else.

347
00:25:49,793 --> 00:25:52,035
But some people
know the exact moment

348
00:25:52,254 --> 00:25:53,878
where their lives changed.

349
00:25:54,214 --> 00:25:56,420
They saw the person
they were going to marry

350
00:25:56,634 --> 00:26:00,133
or the look in their baby's eyes
the first time he smiled.

351
00:26:00,471 --> 00:26:01,751
For some people.

352
00:26:01,973 --> 00:26:04,546
it's not the good things in life
that made them change.

353
00:26:04,976 --> 00:26:07,218
It's something
they've gone through

354
00:26:07,437 --> 00:26:09,513
that makes everything
they look at from that moment on

355
00:26:09,815 --> 00:26:12,602
seem very different
from how it had always been.

356
00:26:12,818 --> 00:26:15,772
Beautiful boy
you got there, Russell.

357
00:26:15,988 --> 00:26:18,609
Yeah, he takes after his mum.

358
00:26:18,824 --> 00:26:20,366
Yeah, he does.

359
00:26:24,998 --> 00:26:27,571
You've got the life,
I'm telling you.

360
00:26:28,001 --> 00:26:29,495
You've got
the best girl in Bement,

361
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,330
a beautiful boy,

362
00:26:31,546 --> 00:26:33,585
you got your memories
of your heroic youth.

363
00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:36,634
Yeah, I've got it all.

364
00:26:36,969 --> 00:26:39,673
Russell, if I was you, I'd be
the happiest man in town.

365
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:42,973
I wouldn't be looking like
something the cat dragged in.

366
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:45,805
Bill, I'm all right.

367
00:26:48,022 --> 00:26:51,058
I just have, uh...

368
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:53,564
trouble sleeping, that's all.

369
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:55,237
BOY: Come on, stop!

370
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:57,107
(laughing)

371
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:16,624
Hey!

372
00:27:16,845 --> 00:27:21,258
- Get off of him! Let him go!
- Go...go, go!

373
00:27:21,475 --> 00:27:26,220
#. For they'll never know
what love can do #.

374
00:27:26,647 --> 00:27:32,436
#. To each his own. I found my own #.

375
00:27:32,862 --> 00:27:41,570
#. One and only...you #.

376
00:27:41,997 --> 00:27:44,369
(baby coos)

377
00:28:02,102 --> 00:28:05,268
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

378
00:28:06,232 --> 00:28:07,560
It's all right.

379
00:28:10,069 --> 00:28:11,777
I get these pictures
in my head...

380
00:28:13,907 --> 00:28:16,314
and I can't concentrate
on anything.

381
00:28:20,289 --> 00:28:23,824
Pictures in your head...
from the war?

382
00:28:26,629 --> 00:28:28,871
I was shot in the gut, Kate...

383
00:28:33,136 --> 00:28:35,591
And I was dying...

384
00:28:36,014 --> 00:28:38,718
and my plane was going down.

385
00:28:39,142 --> 00:28:44,267
And three days later,
I was in a field in France

386
00:28:44,481 --> 00:28:46,806
with all of my men...

387
00:28:48,527 --> 00:28:51,943
With no idea where we'd been
for those three days

388
00:28:52,156 --> 00:28:54,279
or how we'd gotten to that field...

389
00:28:56,035 --> 00:28:58,027
Or why weren't we dead.

390
00:29:00,582 --> 00:29:02,705
What did your men say?

391
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:05,710
We never talked about it.

392
00:29:11,093 --> 00:29:13,050
Something happened to me.

393
00:29:15,181 --> 00:29:17,220
I don't know what.

394
00:29:19,436 --> 00:29:22,271
I just have this feeling
it's still happening.

395
00:30:03,024 --> 00:30:05,431
Jetzt bist du mein gefangener.

396
00:30:05,861 --> 00:30:08,268
RUSSELL: Aah!

397
00:30:08,489 --> 00:30:09,864
Get away from me!

398
00:30:10,074 --> 00:30:11,272
It was a dream!

399
00:30:11,492 --> 00:30:12,772
Get away from me!

400
00:30:12,993 --> 00:30:15,400
It was a dream.
You're all right, honey.

401
00:30:15,621 --> 00:30:18,242
You're here with me.
It was a dream.

402
00:30:18,666 --> 00:30:21,335
It was a dream. A dream.

403
00:30:21,753 --> 00:30:24,919
A dream. It was a dream.

404
00:30:25,131 --> 00:30:26,673
(panting)

405
00:30:36,811 --> 00:30:38,471
You're all right, sweetie.

406
00:30:38,688 --> 00:30:40,597
You're all right.

407
00:30:40,815 --> 00:30:42,854
It wasn't a dream.

408
00:31:12,307 --> 00:31:16,091
For God's sakes, Russell,
how are we gonna get out?

409
00:31:16,478 --> 00:31:18,102
It doesn't matter.

410
00:31:20,316 --> 00:31:22,771
As long as they can't get in.

411
00:31:22,986 --> 00:31:25,192
Who? As long as who
can't get in?

412
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:27,855
You don't want to know.

413
00:31:39,587 --> 00:31:40,666
Russell! Russell!

414
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,003
- Look at me!
- No! No!

415
00:31:45,134 --> 00:31:46,676
What's happening to you?

416
00:31:58,107 --> 00:32:00,479
You're gonna let them
give this to the press, too?

417
00:32:00,693 --> 00:32:03,444
Well, it was one thing
when we knew it was a lie.

418
00:32:03,863 --> 00:32:05,273
We can control that.

419
00:32:05,698 --> 00:32:07,156
But now that it's real,

420
00:32:07,367 --> 00:32:09,443
there's no way
we can let this out.

421
00:32:09,661 --> 00:32:10,775
Who found it?

422
00:32:10,996 --> 00:32:12,406
A father and his sons out hiking.

423
00:32:12,831 --> 00:32:13,862
Did you clean that up?

424
00:32:14,082 --> 00:32:15,161
I already have.

425
00:32:15,375 --> 00:32:16,833
That's good.

426
00:32:17,252 --> 00:32:20,952
Son...I appreciate your
coming to me with this,

427
00:32:21,382 --> 00:32:25,510
and when the time comes,
you won't be forgotten.

428
00:32:30,183 --> 00:32:31,974
Sir, when I went inside the craft,

429
00:32:32,185 --> 00:32:34,972
there were--
there were five seats.

430
00:32:35,397 --> 00:32:37,520
There are only four bodies.

431
00:32:37,733 --> 00:32:41,184
Canvass everything
within a 200-mile radius

432
00:32:41,403 --> 00:32:42,813
of the crash site.

433
00:32:43,239 --> 00:32:44,816
If something crawled
out of here alive,

434
00:32:45,241 --> 00:32:46,818
I want to know about it.

435
00:32:49,746 --> 00:32:54,455
People are lonely in this world
for lots of different reasons.

436
00:32:54,876 --> 00:32:57,248
Some people have something
in their disposition.

437
00:32:57,671 --> 00:32:59,996
Maybe they
were just born too mean.

438
00:33:00,215 --> 00:33:01,839
or maybe
they were born too tender.

439
00:33:02,259 --> 00:33:04,002
But most people are brought
to where they are

440
00:33:04,428 --> 00:33:07,548
by circumstance.
by calamity or a broken heart

441
00:33:07,765 --> 00:33:10,137
or something else happening
in their lives

442
00:33:10,351 --> 00:33:11,975
that wasn't anything
they planned on.

443
00:33:12,395 --> 00:33:14,019
What the hell's wrong
with my chicken?

444
00:33:14,439 --> 00:33:16,016
I don't think
it was your chicken, Tyler.

445
00:33:17,526 --> 00:33:20,099
(sighs)

446
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:21,856
You can go on home, Sally.

447
00:33:22,072 --> 00:33:24,360
I'll take care of these
stragglers and lock up.

448
00:33:24,783 --> 00:33:27,025
'Lessen, of course,
you want to call Fred

449
00:33:27,244 --> 00:33:29,699
and tell him you're leaving him
and the kids for me.

450
00:33:30,123 --> 00:33:32,744
Well, maybe I best go home
and tell him in person, Tyler.

451
00:33:35,337 --> 00:33:37,828
He ain't good enough
for you, Sal.

452
00:33:43,095 --> 00:33:46,843
People are lonely in this world
for lots of different reasons.

453
00:33:48,476 --> 00:33:50,552
The one thing
that I do know is.

454
00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:54,103
it doesn't matter what any one of them
might tell you--

455
00:33:54,315 --> 00:33:56,888
nobody wants to be alone.

456
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:06,070
- Shoehorn?
- What?

457
00:34:06,495 --> 00:34:07,905
The shoehorn--
have you seen it?

458
00:34:10,499 --> 00:34:12,207
You have to leave tonight?

459
00:34:12,418 --> 00:34:13,960
I'm in San Antonio
tomorrow afternoon

460
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:15,712
selling to
an insurance company.

461
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:18,288
Those guys can smell
road sweat on a person.

462
00:34:18,508 --> 00:34:20,750
They don't respond well
to road sweat.

463
00:34:21,178 --> 00:34:22,636
Did the kids eat?

464
00:34:22,846 --> 00:34:24,304
You want me to feed the kids?

465
00:34:24,515 --> 00:34:27,136
You're the waitress, you feed 'em.

466
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:32,142
I gotta go.

467
00:34:32,523 --> 00:34:34,231
I'll see you in three weeks.

468
00:34:34,525 --> 00:34:36,564
If something comes up,
call the home office.

469
00:34:36,778 --> 00:34:38,521
They know where I am.

470
00:35:05,308 --> 00:35:08,677
(racket in distance)

471
00:36:29,399 --> 00:36:30,727
(rustling)

472
00:36:35,656 --> 00:36:37,316
(thunder)

473
00:36:49,963 --> 00:36:51,540
MAN: Please help me.

474
00:37:05,855 --> 00:37:08,227
Stay right here for just a second.

475
00:37:16,241 --> 00:37:18,992
Tom, honey.
Wake up, sweetie.

476
00:37:19,245 --> 00:37:20,324
What's wrong?

477
00:37:20,538 --> 00:37:23,289
Nothing. I need you
to go sleep on the couch, okay?

478
00:37:23,708 --> 00:37:25,831
Who's that?

479
00:37:26,044 --> 00:37:27,621
We'll talk about it
in the morning.

480
00:37:28,046 --> 00:37:29,623
Go get the pillow
and the extra blanket

481
00:37:30,048 --> 00:37:31,506
from my bed.

482
00:37:31,925 --> 00:37:33,633
Come on, sweetie, go on.

483
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:40,595
Go on.

484
00:37:53,365 --> 00:37:55,772
You really should see a doctor.

485
00:37:59,705 --> 00:38:04,533
I'll be fine as soon as I can
collect my thoughts.

486
00:38:09,173 --> 00:38:10,548
Thank you.

487
00:38:10,758 --> 00:38:13,213
Thank you for bringing me in.

488
00:38:16,431 --> 00:38:17,545
Good night.

489
00:38:25,065 --> 00:38:26,559
Who is he?

490
00:38:26,776 --> 00:38:27,807
Who's that man?

491
00:38:28,152 --> 00:38:30,275
He's a stranger, honey,
and he's hurt.

492
00:38:30,488 --> 00:38:32,564
How long does he
have to stay in my room?

493
00:38:32,782 --> 00:38:33,813
I don't know.

494
00:38:34,033 --> 00:38:35,195
I guess until he's better.

495
00:38:35,619 --> 00:38:38,869
Mama, what happened
to your nose?

496
00:38:48,966 --> 00:38:50,674
Some people
have given up all hope

497
00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:53,501
of anything in their lives
ever changing.

498
00:38:53,721 --> 00:38:56,390
They just go on with it
day by day.

499
00:38:56,808 --> 00:38:58,302
and if something
were to come along

500
00:38:58,727 --> 00:39:00,055
and make things different.

501
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:03,140
they probably wouldn't even
notice it right off.

502
00:39:03,357 --> 00:39:05,764
except maybe for that
kind of nervous feeling

503
00:39:05,985 --> 00:39:07,443
you get in your stomach.

504
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:11,023
My mom and I used to call that
"the car trip feeling. "

505
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:13,363
because it was how I'd feel
whenever I knew

506
00:39:13,576 --> 00:39:15,782
we were going to go
somewhere far away

507
00:39:16,162 --> 00:39:17,704
or somewhere new.

508
00:39:36,017 --> 00:39:37,297
How you feeling?

509
00:39:37,519 --> 00:39:39,558
I'm much better.

510
00:39:39,771 --> 00:39:40,850
What's this?

511
00:39:41,273 --> 00:39:42,897
Breakfast.

512
00:39:46,653 --> 00:39:47,732
Thank you.

513
00:39:49,532 --> 00:39:51,240
Maybe in a few minutes.

514
00:39:52,535 --> 00:39:54,112
The bathroom's
right down the hall.

515
00:39:54,328 --> 00:39:56,735
I put out some towels
and shirt and pants

516
00:39:57,165 --> 00:39:59,490
that belonged to my husband
before he gained weight.

517
00:39:59,709 --> 00:40:01,500
I reckon you can keep 'em.

518
00:40:01,711 --> 00:40:03,253
That's very kind.

519
00:40:05,507 --> 00:40:08,591
Your husband doesn't appreciate
that kindness in you.

520
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:15,141
He doesn't see
your sadness, either.

521
00:40:15,351 --> 00:40:17,758
But you've stopped
wanting him to.

522
00:40:20,523 --> 00:40:22,848
I think you're right.

523
00:40:23,068 --> 00:40:26,768
There's some things you don't share
with an uncaring person.

524
00:40:32,161 --> 00:40:33,869
What happened to you?

525
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:36,286
I was in an accident.

526
00:40:37,417 --> 00:40:39,659
I can see that.
What kind of accident?

527
00:40:41,129 --> 00:40:42,504
Farming.

528
00:40:42,922 --> 00:40:44,499
You got a farm around here?

529
00:40:44,925 --> 00:40:46,502
No, l...

530
00:40:47,886 --> 00:40:49,629
Someone gave me a ride.

531
00:40:52,391 --> 00:40:53,090
(groans)

532
00:40:56,437 --> 00:40:57,551
What's wrong?

533
00:40:57,772 --> 00:40:59,349
Oh, I woke up
with this headache.

534
00:40:59,774 --> 00:41:01,268
I thought it was gone already.

535
00:41:01,693 --> 00:41:03,732
You were telling me
about your accident.

536
00:41:03,945 --> 00:41:07,148
I'm not feeling much
like talking right now.

537
00:41:07,365 --> 00:41:09,523
Would you mind letting me rest
for a while?

538
00:41:09,952 --> 00:41:11,576
I'm sorry. Sure, not at all.

539
00:41:12,121 --> 00:41:13,615
I'll put the tray here.

540
00:41:13,914 --> 00:41:17,365
That way, it'll be here
if you wake up hungry.

541
00:41:28,138 --> 00:41:29,632
You were right, you know.

542
00:41:31,975 --> 00:41:35,510
I guess I don't care
if my husband sees my sadness.

543
00:42:03,968 --> 00:42:05,759
Early in the morning of the 5th,

544
00:42:06,012 --> 00:42:11,884
this debris was recovered
in a field near Roswell, New Mexico.

545
00:42:12,227 --> 00:42:14,100
Earlier reports have stated

546
00:42:14,396 --> 00:42:16,803
that this debris
was the wreckage

547
00:42:17,024 --> 00:42:20,144
of a flying saucer.

548
00:42:20,361 --> 00:42:23,694
I'm afraid we are here today
to pop that balloon

549
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:27,490
and replace it
with one of our own.

550
00:42:27,702 --> 00:42:30,786
This, gentlemen,
is a weather balloon.

551
00:42:30,956 --> 00:42:33,328
On any given day
in the United States,

552
00:42:33,542 --> 00:42:35,867
there are hundreds
of these in the air,

553
00:42:36,211 --> 00:42:39,128
and they do not come
from outer space.

554
00:42:39,381 --> 00:42:42,666
They are manufactured
in Cleveland.

555
00:42:42,885 --> 00:42:46,170
This is its radar reflector.

556
00:42:46,389 --> 00:42:48,631
It tracks wind speed.

557
00:42:49,058 --> 00:42:52,509
None of this debris
is from outer space.

558
00:42:52,729 --> 00:42:56,145
The reflector is made
in Newark, New Jersey,

559
00:42:56,358 --> 00:42:59,062
and the balloon
is made in Cleveland.

560
00:43:01,071 --> 00:43:04,191
Excuse me, sir. I wonder
if I might have a word.

561
00:43:04,408 --> 00:43:06,531
Yes, Captain?

562
00:43:06,744 --> 00:43:09,235
I was wondering, sir,
what we're gonna do now.

563
00:43:09,455 --> 00:43:10,949
About what?

564
00:43:11,291 --> 00:43:14,042
About the craft, about the bodies.

565
00:43:14,461 --> 00:43:16,667
What craft?

566
00:43:17,089 --> 00:43:18,749
What bodies?

567
00:43:37,778 --> 00:43:39,901
MAN: It's clearly organic.

568
00:43:40,113 --> 00:43:42,734
SECOND MAN:
It's not clearly anything.

569
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:44,693
Jenkins says it's animal,

570
00:43:44,910 --> 00:43:48,279
and it takes on the characteristics
of an animal cell.

571
00:43:48,497 --> 00:43:50,573
Kraus says
it's some sort of fungus,

572
00:43:50,792 --> 00:43:52,369
which would explain
its sameness and density,

573
00:43:52,794 --> 00:43:56,922
and we look again, and it has
those characteristics.

574
00:43:57,132 --> 00:44:00,252
It seems
to be able to change...

575
00:44:00,469 --> 00:44:02,841
into whatever we want it to be.

576
00:44:08,352 --> 00:44:10,475
You'd all better
come see Dr Goldin.

577
00:44:13,441 --> 00:44:20,025
(man singing in Hebrew)

578
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:26,739
MAN: I came to check
on the body from the crash,

579
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:28,741
and I found him like this.

580
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:30,743
CAMPBELL: What's he saying?

581
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:32,543
Is it German?

582
00:44:32,754 --> 00:44:34,414
Goldin wouldn't speak German.

583
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:36,037
It's Hebrew.

584
00:44:36,466 --> 00:44:39,039
What has he done with the body?

585
00:44:41,596 --> 00:44:44,265
My God.

586
00:45:05,998 --> 00:45:08,074
(panting)

587
00:46:21,287 --> 00:46:22,745
Hello, operator?

588
00:46:22,956 --> 00:46:24,995
I'd like to place a call
to Fresno, California.

589
00:46:25,208 --> 00:46:28,541
Madison 4573.

590
00:46:38,639 --> 00:46:41,675
Yes, ma'am, thank you.

591
00:46:49,901 --> 00:46:51,395
(toy rattling)

592
00:46:59,704 --> 00:47:01,447
My crew of nine men...

593
00:47:06,503 --> 00:47:09,207
Eight of them are dead.

594
00:47:12,259 --> 00:47:15,462
And Johnson, my co-pilot...

595
00:47:17,681 --> 00:47:19,472
He's in the hospital at Fort Bliss,

596
00:47:19,683 --> 00:47:21,225
not expected to recover.

597
00:47:25,064 --> 00:47:26,474
What happened to them?

598
00:47:30,862 --> 00:47:32,272
No one knows.

599
00:47:37,036 --> 00:47:39,491
No one has any idea at all.

600
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:49,503
What are you doing?

601
00:47:49,716 --> 00:47:51,958
I have to find out
what's happened to my men

602
00:47:52,219 --> 00:47:53,713
and what's happening to me.

603
00:47:53,929 --> 00:47:55,091
No, you don't.

604
00:47:55,389 --> 00:47:58,840
Kate, I'm no husband...

605
00:47:59,059 --> 00:48:00,802
and I'm no father to our boy

606
00:48:01,228 --> 00:48:03,434
until I can find out
what's going on.

607
00:48:03,689 --> 00:48:05,847
You're not going to find
anything out there, Russell.

608
00:48:06,067 --> 00:48:07,810
What do you think
you're gonna find?

609
00:48:11,406 --> 00:48:13,648
- Bishop, right?
- I'm Bishop.

610
00:48:13,867 --> 00:48:16,322
You flew Colonel Campbell
out of Fort Worth the other night.

611
00:48:16,745 --> 00:48:18,488
- Right.
- Destination?

612
00:48:18,914 --> 00:48:20,372
That's need-to-know.

613
00:48:20,791 --> 00:48:24,290
Army intelligence. I need to know.

614
00:48:25,630 --> 00:48:27,836
Captain Crawford. Is that right?

615
00:48:30,426 --> 00:48:32,798
Colonel Campbell told me
you might want to talk to me.

616
00:48:44,150 --> 00:48:46,226
(footsteps approach)

617
00:48:46,444 --> 00:48:49,279
WOMAN:
A gentleman to see you, Miss.

618
00:48:52,158 --> 00:48:53,568
OWEN:
Can you go for a ride?

619
00:48:56,413 --> 00:48:58,037
I'll get my car coat.

620
00:48:58,457 --> 00:49:00,663
No, I said a ride,

621
00:49:00,876 --> 00:49:02,702
not a drive.

622
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:04,711
Loosen up on the reins
just a little.

623
00:49:04,922 --> 00:49:06,001
- Okay. Okay.
- There you go.

624
00:49:06,298 --> 00:49:07,708
- Like that?
- Yep.

625
00:49:07,925 --> 00:49:10,131
There you go. You all right?

626
00:49:10,344 --> 00:49:12,087
- Yeah, I'm good.
- Okay.

627
00:49:16,476 --> 00:49:17,851
You all right?

628
00:49:21,732 --> 00:49:23,190
You doing okay?

629
00:49:26,904 --> 00:49:29,691
- You want to go faster?
- Yes.

630
00:49:29,907 --> 00:49:31,069
- Are you sure?
- Yes, please.

631
00:49:31,492 --> 00:49:33,034
Okay. Okay.

632
00:49:39,501 --> 00:49:41,577
Where did you learn to ride?

633
00:49:41,795 --> 00:49:44,582
One of my many odd jobs
before I found the army.

634
00:49:45,966 --> 00:49:48,005
Well, I'm glad you found us.

635
00:49:49,512 --> 00:49:51,800
I was afraid you wouldn't
come out with me.

636
00:49:52,014 --> 00:49:53,294
Why wouldn't I come?

637
00:49:53,516 --> 00:49:54,630
Your father.

638
00:49:54,851 --> 00:49:57,009
He's so dead set against
you and me seeing each other.

639
00:49:57,228 --> 00:50:00,561
I'm not quite sure why he
has such a low opinion of me.

640
00:50:00,774 --> 00:50:03,858
Well, I'm not my father.

641
00:50:04,069 --> 00:50:05,777
I know that.

642
00:50:14,247 --> 00:50:17,034
You're the sun
and the moon to me, Anne.

643
00:50:18,835 --> 00:50:20,543
The sun and the moon.

644
00:50:47,241 --> 00:50:48,616
Here we go.

645
00:50:48,826 --> 00:50:49,821
Thank you.

646
00:50:50,035 --> 00:50:51,280
You're welcome.

647
00:50:59,879 --> 00:51:01,752
(chuckles)

648
00:51:01,965 --> 00:51:03,340
(giggles)

649
00:51:06,178 --> 00:51:09,344
Um...Anne...

650
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:13,223
I had to come up
through the ROTC ranks.

651
00:51:13,602 --> 00:51:16,057
I may never be anything more
than a captain.

652
00:51:16,272 --> 00:51:17,386
I don't care.

653
00:51:17,773 --> 00:51:19,433
But I can tell you this--

654
00:51:19,776 --> 00:51:22,064
I'm gonna do some things
in this world, Anne.

655
00:51:22,278 --> 00:51:25,647
I am nobody's fool, and I know
that I can make my mark.

656
00:51:28,118 --> 00:51:29,446
Anne...

657
00:51:33,123 --> 00:51:34,831
Will you marry me?

658
00:51:40,214 --> 00:51:42,586
Owen, what happened
back there up on the hill--

659
00:51:42,967 --> 00:51:45,090
I would never do anything
like that with anyone

660
00:51:45,303 --> 00:51:47,509
but the woman
I intend to marry.

661
00:51:51,643 --> 00:51:52,841
Marry me.

662
00:51:54,188 --> 00:51:56,857
- Owen.
- (laughs)

663
00:51:58,484 --> 00:51:59,942
Marry me.

664
00:52:08,578 --> 00:52:10,120
I want to tell your father.

665
00:52:10,330 --> 00:52:12,453
Do you have any idea
where he's gone?

666
00:52:12,666 --> 00:52:18,918
He seemed to be able
to reach inside my brain,

667
00:52:19,256 --> 00:52:22,459
to use my own memories
as a stage

668
00:52:22,677 --> 00:52:26,010
on which to mount
our conversation.

669
00:52:26,222 --> 00:52:28,214
I don't quite follow, professor.

670
00:52:28,433 --> 00:52:30,472
I was there...

671
00:52:30,685 --> 00:52:33,057
in that room...

672
00:52:35,357 --> 00:52:37,563
My bar mitzvah in Dresden.

673
00:52:40,696 --> 00:52:43,068
If I could have stayed...

674
00:52:45,076 --> 00:52:47,911
I could have spoken again
with my father.

675
00:53:17,277 --> 00:53:19,400
(alarm sounding)

676
00:53:33,295 --> 00:53:35,334
I wish...

677
00:53:35,547 --> 00:53:37,539
to see my father.

678
00:54:04,119 --> 00:54:06,526
What in God's name
happened here?

679
00:54:06,956 --> 00:54:09,411
They're both dead.

680
00:54:10,168 --> 00:54:11,792
(siren)

681
00:54:38,448 --> 00:54:39,728
Mind stepping out
of the car, sir?

682
00:54:40,158 --> 00:54:41,782
What did I do, officer?

683
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:45,196
Would you mind stepping
out of the car, sir?

684
00:54:48,167 --> 00:54:50,622
Thank you, officer,
I'll take it from here.

685
00:54:50,836 --> 00:54:52,246
Captain Crawford,
Army Intelligence.

686
00:54:52,672 --> 00:54:54,415
This is a routine debriefing.

687
00:54:54,841 --> 00:54:55,955
Routine?

688
00:54:56,176 --> 00:54:58,418
I apologize for
the unconventional approach.

689
00:54:58,637 --> 00:55:00,428
I'll be honest with you.

690
00:55:00,639 --> 00:55:02,631
There's a leak in the project.
Someone's talking.

691
00:55:02,849 --> 00:55:04,426
We don't suspect you,

692
00:55:04,643 --> 00:55:06,303
but we need to go over
some information

693
00:55:06,729 --> 00:55:08,437
to verify the source
of the leak.

694
00:55:08,856 --> 00:55:11,311
Does this have to do with
what happened to Dr Goldin?

695
00:55:13,486 --> 00:55:14,648
In part, yes.

696
00:55:14,862 --> 00:55:16,605
I don't see how Dr Goldin's death

697
00:55:17,031 --> 00:55:19,403
could have anything
to do with a leak.

698
00:55:19,784 --> 00:55:23,117
Why don't you tell me
what you think happened?

699
00:55:23,330 --> 00:55:26,699
Well, Dr Goldin
was in the room with, uh...

700
00:55:27,126 --> 00:55:30,329
the one that turned out to be alive.

701
00:55:30,546 --> 00:55:32,088
Apparently, they can...

702
00:55:32,506 --> 00:55:34,664
well, uh, this is incredible.

703
00:55:34,884 --> 00:55:37,042
We saw it first
on a cellular level.

704
00:55:38,596 --> 00:55:41,087
They can become
whatever they want.

705
00:55:42,517 --> 00:55:44,842
I don't follow you at all.

706
00:55:45,062 --> 00:55:46,805
They can appear as people.

707
00:55:48,107 --> 00:55:50,811
Dr Goldin, for example,
thought he was 1 3,

708
00:55:51,235 --> 00:55:52,645
at his bar mitzvah.

709
00:55:52,862 --> 00:55:54,688
He saw his father.

710
00:55:54,906 --> 00:55:57,064
Apparently, that's what killed him.

711
00:55:57,283 --> 00:55:59,441
And the...visitor.

712
00:56:01,705 --> 00:56:03,329
You've been a lot of help,

713
00:56:03,748 --> 00:56:05,325
and, doctor, I think
you can appreciate

714
00:56:05,751 --> 00:56:07,031
how important it could be

715
00:56:07,252 --> 00:56:09,410
that you say nothing about this
to anyone.

716
00:56:12,383 --> 00:56:14,589
They can appear
as people, you say?

717
00:56:14,844 --> 00:56:17,417
Yes, as unbelievable
as that seems.

718
00:56:17,638 --> 00:56:19,262
And exposure to one
of these apparitions,

719
00:56:19,682 --> 00:56:22,054
that's what killed Dr Goldin?

720
00:56:22,435 --> 00:56:25,720
It's not safe to spend
too much time with one of them.

721
00:56:25,939 --> 00:56:27,433
Whoa.

722
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:35,356
How do you feel?

723
00:56:35,574 --> 00:56:38,824
Like I'm floating.

724
00:56:49,631 --> 00:56:51,089
Headaches?

725
00:56:51,466 --> 00:56:53,126
Anything like that?

726
00:56:53,344 --> 00:56:55,253
Nothing like that.

727
00:56:57,264 --> 00:56:59,885
That's good. That's good.

728
00:57:00,309 --> 00:57:01,507
(footsteps)

729
00:57:14,616 --> 00:57:15,861
Tom?

730
00:57:19,455 --> 00:57:20,830
Becky?

731
00:57:25,879 --> 00:57:29,663
Wimmy, wammy, woo!

732
00:57:35,514 --> 00:57:37,672
That was amazing.

733
00:57:44,482 --> 00:57:47,317
BECKY: Mama,
John's been doin' magic tricks

734
00:57:47,527 --> 00:57:49,852
that are much better than Tom's.

735
00:57:51,531 --> 00:57:52,610
You're not hungry?

736
00:57:53,033 --> 00:57:54,491
- No, l--
- He's never hungry.

737
00:57:54,701 --> 00:57:55,732
Tom, that's enough.

738
00:57:56,036 --> 00:57:57,198
No, it's all right.

739
00:57:58,497 --> 00:58:00,822
How are you feeling?
Your headache?

740
00:58:01,041 --> 00:58:03,662
I'm fine. I hadn't even
thought about it. Thank you.

741
00:58:03,878 --> 00:58:05,455
Good. That's good.

742
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:07,504
TOM: So where did you
come from, anyway?

743
00:58:07,924 --> 00:58:11,257
- Tom...
- I don't mind.

744
00:58:11,469 --> 00:58:12,500
I come from Des Moines.

745
00:58:12,721 --> 00:58:15,212
That's like 1,000 miles
away from here.

746
00:58:15,432 --> 00:58:16,594
How'd you know that?

747
00:58:16,808 --> 00:58:18,516
It's where
my magic kit came from.

748
00:58:18,727 --> 00:58:21,134
Tom, Becky, sit up
and watch your manners.

749
00:58:21,355 --> 00:58:23,513
I come from there originally.

750
00:58:23,733 --> 00:58:27,102
I've just been working
anyplace I could since then.

751
00:58:27,528 --> 00:58:28,856
Farm work, mainly.

752
00:58:29,072 --> 00:58:31,195
What happened to you
that got you so messed up?

753
00:58:31,574 --> 00:58:33,151
Machine accident.

754
00:58:33,368 --> 00:58:35,277
Why are you being
so mean to John?

755
00:58:35,495 --> 00:58:37,534
- He's our friend.
- He's not my friend.

756
00:58:37,748 --> 00:58:40,499
You certainly seem
to be recovering nicely.

757
00:58:40,709 --> 00:58:45,205
Like I told you,
I just needed a little rest.

758
00:58:45,423 --> 00:58:47,000
SALLY: So now that
you're feeling better,

759
00:58:47,425 --> 00:58:48,883
I guess you'll be moving on?

760
00:58:49,093 --> 00:58:50,124
JOHN: I guess so.

761
00:58:50,345 --> 00:58:52,088
I just need a few more days.

762
00:59:02,566 --> 00:59:05,769
Everyone knows
not to stare into the sun.

763
00:59:05,987 --> 00:59:08,738
It's something your mother
tells you when you're a kid.

764
00:59:09,073 --> 00:59:11,824
"Don't look at the sun.
or you'll go blind. "

765
00:59:12,035 --> 00:59:14,870
But sometimes you want to
understand something so badly

766
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:17,749
that you'll risk going blind
for just a glimpse

767
00:59:17,958 --> 00:59:19,997
of what it all might be about.

768
00:59:30,638 --> 00:59:31,669
Damn.

769
00:59:34,350 --> 00:59:36,342
I brought you something.

770
00:59:38,814 --> 00:59:40,012
Thanks, Captain.

771
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:42,100
You got married, huh?

772
00:59:43,652 --> 00:59:45,229
Same girl?

773
00:59:45,571 --> 00:59:47,777
The one that worked at the bank?

774
00:59:49,158 --> 00:59:50,533
Yeah, same one.

775
01:00:00,921 --> 01:00:03,376
What the hell
are you doing here, Captain?

776
01:00:05,718 --> 01:00:08,043
Not that I'm not glad to see you.

777
01:00:10,556 --> 01:00:12,881
Do you know about the other men?

778
01:00:15,186 --> 01:00:16,596
What about them?

779
01:00:19,649 --> 01:00:20,847
They're dead.

780
01:00:23,987 --> 01:00:25,066
Same thing?

781
01:00:26,365 --> 01:00:27,989
Yeah, more or less.

782
01:00:31,370 --> 01:00:32,532
What about you?

783
01:00:32,747 --> 01:00:35,867
How come you're
the walking one and only?

784
01:00:38,795 --> 01:00:40,419
I don't know.

785
01:00:43,049 --> 01:00:45,337
Do you believe in God, Captain?

786
01:00:48,597 --> 01:00:50,589
Yes. Yes, I do.

787
01:00:53,227 --> 01:00:54,685
How about you?

788
01:00:56,105 --> 01:00:58,560
Not in any way that helps.

789
01:01:03,071 --> 01:01:05,063
Look, I'm sorry, Captain.

790
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:07,399
I don't mean to sound bitter.

791
01:01:07,618 --> 01:01:09,610
I should be thanking you.

792
01:01:10,913 --> 01:01:14,496
After all, you saved my life.

793
01:01:14,709 --> 01:01:18,078
The thing is, Johnson, um...

794
01:01:22,175 --> 01:01:27,335
Except for these dreams...
I've been having...

795
01:01:29,475 --> 01:01:32,511
I don't remember a thing
about what happened.

796
01:01:32,728 --> 01:01:35,894
Aw, well, hell, Captain,
that's a damn shame,

797
01:01:36,107 --> 01:01:39,807
'cause you were an A-1,
Audie Murphy hero.

798
01:01:43,239 --> 01:01:45,564
Whatever they did to us,

799
01:01:45,784 --> 01:01:48,156
they did for a long time.

800
01:01:51,623 --> 01:01:54,458
Whenever I'd stop screaming,

801
01:01:54,668 --> 01:01:57,075
I'd hear one of the other guys.

802
01:01:59,298 --> 01:02:01,871
It seemed like we were there for days.

803
01:02:02,302 --> 01:02:04,425
You were on the cot next to mine.

804
01:02:04,637 --> 01:02:07,424
I don't know,
maybe it was sloppy,

805
01:02:07,849 --> 01:02:11,218
maybe they thought we were
just too far gone to care,

806
01:02:11,603 --> 01:02:13,726
that we wouldn't fight back,

807
01:02:13,939 --> 01:02:16,097
but they put
that machine gun down

808
01:02:16,317 --> 01:02:17,977
right across from your cot...

809
01:02:21,322 --> 01:02:23,610
And they left the clip in the gun,

810
01:02:23,825 --> 01:02:25,651
almost like they
didn't quite understand

811
01:02:25,869 --> 01:02:27,778
how a machine gun worked.

812
01:02:29,331 --> 01:02:31,656
Well, you sure as hell
showed them, Captain.

813
01:02:38,924 --> 01:02:40,418
Only one thing.

814
01:02:42,845 --> 01:02:47,008
You and I both know it wasn't
Germans you killed that day.

815
01:02:48,601 --> 01:02:50,843
It wasn't Germans at all.

816
01:02:56,026 --> 01:02:57,436
How are you coming with the canvass

817
01:02:57,861 --> 01:02:59,438
for the fifth occupant
of the craft?

818
01:02:59,864 --> 01:03:01,274
We haven't had much luck, sir.

819
01:03:01,699 --> 01:03:04,190
You might be interested to know
there was another live one,

820
01:03:04,535 --> 01:03:06,658
at least he was
when he was brought in.

821
01:03:06,871 --> 01:03:09,492
Our scientists have learned
that they have certain abilities.

822
01:03:09,708 --> 01:03:11,617
What kind of abilities?

823
01:03:11,835 --> 01:03:13,412
In good time.

824
01:03:13,628 --> 01:03:16,201
Colonel Campbell...
he's a small and petty man.

825
01:03:16,632 --> 01:03:18,209
I don't like him. He's an idiot!

826
01:03:18,634 --> 01:03:20,044
In an attempt to control

827
01:03:20,386 --> 01:03:23,470
the most important revelation
of the century, if not all time,

828
01:03:23,681 --> 01:03:25,258
the colonel
has confiscated the bodies

829
01:03:25,683 --> 01:03:27,925
and initiated
a high-level cover-up.

830
01:03:28,144 --> 01:03:29,424
He froze you out,

831
01:03:29,687 --> 01:03:31,264
just like he did to us in that field.

832
01:03:31,481 --> 01:03:34,517
He doesn't share the limelight,
and I'm not a person you freeze out.

833
01:03:34,735 --> 01:03:36,526
I'm gonna take
this project from him.

834
01:03:36,737 --> 01:03:38,813
In the process,
I hope to ruin his career.

835
01:03:39,073 --> 01:03:41,860
I will also take down anyone
who stands with him.

836
01:03:42,076 --> 01:03:43,534
I'm under the impression

837
01:03:43,744 --> 01:03:46,365
that the two of you
would never make that mistake.

838
01:03:46,789 --> 01:03:47,820
No, sir.

839
01:03:49,417 --> 01:03:52,204
If you were to have
a bit of luck in your canvass

840
01:03:52,420 --> 01:03:54,459
for what is now
the only live visitor,

841
01:03:54,673 --> 01:03:57,246
I would hope you'd share
that information with someone

842
01:03:57,426 --> 01:03:59,549
who's more forthcoming
than the colonel.

843
01:03:59,762 --> 01:04:01,801
- We would, sir.
- Yes, sir.

844
01:04:03,015 --> 01:04:03,963
Good, Howard.

845
01:04:08,312 --> 01:04:10,885
Oh, I mentioned that they
had certain abilities.

846
01:04:11,107 --> 01:04:13,230
Don't confine your search
to little grey men.

847
01:04:13,610 --> 01:04:16,730
Look for someone
who's a little bit more...

848
01:04:16,947 --> 01:04:18,322
human.

849
01:04:22,953 --> 01:04:25,740
Ah, this is beautiful country.

850
01:04:26,123 --> 01:04:27,831
I guess it is.

851
01:04:28,167 --> 01:04:29,910
Live in a place long enough,

852
01:04:30,294 --> 01:04:32,333
you forget to notice
that sort of thing.

853
01:04:34,299 --> 01:04:36,754
I think it's important
to always try and see

854
01:04:36,968 --> 01:04:39,091
as much as you can.

855
01:04:39,304 --> 01:04:41,973
Sometimes a person's life
can spoil the view.

856
01:04:46,103 --> 01:04:48,510
You're a really special woman.

857
01:04:48,731 --> 01:04:51,566
You need to believe me
when I tell you that.

858
01:04:51,776 --> 01:04:53,815
(chuckles)

859
01:04:54,028 --> 01:04:56,519
You don't know
what you're talking about.

860
01:04:56,740 --> 01:04:58,068
Yes, I do.

861
01:05:03,497 --> 01:05:06,866
You know, I've...

862
01:05:07,084 --> 01:05:10,916
I've done some things
I didn't mean to do.

863
01:05:14,509 --> 01:05:16,169
You don't have to tell me.

864
01:05:16,719 --> 01:05:18,177
And I've--

865
01:05:18,722 --> 01:05:23,550
I've had to learn
to control my emotions.

866
01:05:24,937 --> 01:05:25,932
It's okay...

867
01:05:26,146 --> 01:05:29,562
It's all been worth it...

868
01:05:33,529 --> 01:05:35,735
'Cause it brought me to you.

869
01:06:34,595 --> 01:06:37,133
Oh, I don't know
what's happening here...

870
01:06:39,142 --> 01:06:41,680
But I sure as heck don't care.

871
01:06:50,904 --> 01:06:54,403
And when the Indians
first saw the Spaniards,

872
01:06:54,617 --> 01:06:58,116
they thought
they were gods or devils.

873
01:06:58,538 --> 01:07:00,080
Because to the Indians,

874
01:07:00,456 --> 01:07:03,207
white man
did not look like man at all.

875
01:07:03,626 --> 01:07:05,084
I don't like him.

876
01:07:05,295 --> 01:07:06,326
I think he's nice.

877
01:07:06,796 --> 01:07:09,002
Ahem!

878
01:07:14,930 --> 01:07:16,175
(whispers)

879
01:07:20,353 --> 01:07:22,725
Children...

880
01:07:22,939 --> 01:07:25,560
these gentlemen are
from the United States Army.

881
01:07:25,984 --> 01:07:29,234
They are searching West Texas
for a deserter.

882
01:07:29,446 --> 01:07:31,485
This man ran away from his post.

883
01:07:31,823 --> 01:07:35,655
These men think he might be
hiding around here somewhere.

884
01:07:37,496 --> 01:07:40,069
If anyone has seen a stranger
'round these parts,

885
01:07:40,499 --> 01:07:43,120
you let us know about it right away.

886
01:07:43,544 --> 01:07:45,916
Don't go trying
to talk to him yourself.

887
01:07:46,131 --> 01:07:48,538
This fella's dangerous, boys and girls.

888
01:08:02,106 --> 01:08:04,145
I want to go through
through his clothes and stuff,

889
01:08:04,359 --> 01:08:06,482
see if I can find
anything from the army.

890
01:08:06,694 --> 01:08:07,856
I don't know, Tom.

891
01:08:08,238 --> 01:08:10,480
The sheriff said
the deserter was dangerous.

892
01:08:10,699 --> 01:08:13,071
That's why I want to know
if it's John.

893
01:08:16,038 --> 01:08:17,236
Come on!

894
01:08:32,889 --> 01:08:34,928
Where are his clothes?

895
01:08:49,616 --> 01:08:50,944
BECKY: Tom!

896
01:08:52,911 --> 01:08:55,366
It's him.

897
01:08:56,748 --> 01:08:57,910
JOHN: It's who?

898
01:09:02,213 --> 01:09:03,493
Now listen to me.

899
01:09:03,714 --> 01:09:07,249
You think you know something,
but you don't.

900
01:09:07,468 --> 01:09:09,294
Ah, ah.

901
01:09:09,512 --> 01:09:10,543
Let me go! Let me go!

902
01:09:10,763 --> 01:09:12,387
Let him go! Let him go!

903
01:09:14,476 --> 01:09:15,970
My business here is almost done,

904
01:09:16,395 --> 01:09:17,937
and I won't let you interfere.

905
01:09:23,068 --> 01:09:25,310
BECKY:
Tom, your nose is bleeding.

906
01:09:26,781 --> 01:09:28,156
I'm sorry, Tom. I...

907
01:09:28,533 --> 01:09:30,157
SALLY: Where is everybody?

908
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:38,328
What's with them?

909
01:09:47,678 --> 01:09:49,006
See for yourself.

910
01:10:02,486 --> 01:10:03,814
(dogs barking)

911
01:10:11,662 --> 01:10:14,034
- TOM: Sheriff! Hey, sheriff!
- All right, son.

912
01:10:14,290 --> 01:10:16,697
The man you're looking for
is at our house.

913
01:10:17,043 --> 01:10:18,288
SHERIFF:
Come on, let's move out!

914
01:10:18,712 --> 01:10:20,206
Harry, you take the south road!

915
01:10:52,498 --> 01:10:54,656
My boss down at the diner
called to say

916
01:10:54,876 --> 01:10:56,667
that there were
some soldiers in town

917
01:10:56,878 --> 01:11:01,172
looking for a deserter
from the army base in New Mexico.

918
01:11:05,178 --> 01:11:08,547
I know you come from a place
a whole lot further than that.

919
01:11:16,524 --> 01:11:18,682
I don't know how you
do what you do.

920
01:11:19,110 --> 01:11:21,102
I know you can see into people.

921
01:11:27,911 --> 01:11:30,153
They're gonna be
coming for you soon.

922
01:11:47,391 --> 01:11:49,716
My grandmother gave me these.

923
01:11:49,935 --> 01:11:53,518
She came over to Texas in 1893.

924
01:11:53,939 --> 01:11:56,227
I always thought
they were kind of funny.

925
01:11:56,567 --> 01:11:59,058
They're for Texas,
the Lone Star state,

926
01:11:59,278 --> 01:12:00,938
and there's two of 'em.

927
01:12:07,788 --> 01:12:10,742
Will you take one with you?

928
01:12:10,958 --> 01:12:12,831
And I'll keep the other.

929
01:12:39,572 --> 01:12:42,656
Can I see you once
before you go?

930
01:13:16,403 --> 01:13:18,609
You better go inside.

931
01:14:50,088 --> 01:14:52,376
(engine dies)

932
01:14:52,590 --> 01:14:54,997
What's this? Come on!

933
01:14:55,343 --> 01:14:56,753
(engine sputters)

934
01:14:57,304 --> 01:14:58,714
I don't know
what the trouble is.

935
01:15:01,934 --> 01:15:03,677
(whooshing)

936
01:15:09,150 --> 01:15:10,893
That summer.
a lot of things had happened

937
01:15:11,319 --> 01:15:13,442
that people couldn't explain.

938
01:15:13,655 --> 01:15:16,442
There had been lights in the sky

939
01:15:16,658 --> 01:15:19,943
and stories in the paper
about saucers crashing.

940
01:15:20,162 --> 01:15:23,745
John had come.
and then he had gone.

941
01:15:24,166 --> 01:15:26,289
Put it on the table.
Take the cookies out.

942
01:15:26,502 --> 01:15:28,957
For a while.
life went back to being life.

943
01:15:29,380 --> 01:15:31,622
and almost everyone
forgot the things that

944
01:15:31,841 --> 01:15:34,510
that summer had brought
with it from out of the sky.

945
01:15:36,012 --> 01:15:38,051
(knocks)

946
01:15:58,161 --> 01:16:00,284
He's gone, hasn't he?

947
01:16:00,705 --> 01:16:01,985
He has.

948
01:16:04,626 --> 01:16:05,657
Home?

949
01:16:07,713 --> 01:16:09,539
Yes, home.

950
01:16:13,219 --> 01:16:15,342
I guess I'm too late, then.

951
01:16:15,555 --> 01:16:16,930
Ma'am.

952
01:16:39,038 --> 01:16:41,363
(screaming )

953
01:16:41,583 --> 01:16:44,038
JOHNSON: What the hell
are you doing here. Captain?

954
01:16:44,461 --> 01:16:46,169
RUSSELL:
I don't remember a thing

955
01:16:46,588 --> 01:16:48,082
about what happened.

956
01:16:48,298 --> 01:16:50,540
I don't remember a thing
about what happened.

957
01:16:50,759 --> 01:16:53,047
Aw. well. hell. Captain.
that's a damn shame.

958
01:16:53,262 --> 01:16:54,839
You sure as hell
showed them. Captain.

959
01:16:55,264 --> 01:16:56,888
You were an A- 1.
Audie Murphy--

960
01:16:57,433 --> 01:16:59,509
You sure as hell
showed them. Captain.

961
01:16:59,727 --> 01:17:01,055
Only one thing.

962
01:17:01,271 --> 01:17:02,813
You and I both know

963
01:17:03,064 --> 01:17:05,056
those weren't Germans
you killed that day.

964
01:17:05,275 --> 01:17:06,983
Those weren't Germans
you killed that day.

965
01:17:09,029 --> 01:17:10,357
Wasn't Germans at all.

966
01:17:49,030 --> 01:17:50,773
I thought I told you to keep
that woman away from me.

967
01:17:51,199 --> 01:17:54,734
I'm doing my best, sir.
She's somewhat persistent.

968
01:17:54,953 --> 01:17:56,661
Persistent?

969
01:17:58,582 --> 01:17:59,696
Right.

970
01:18:02,170 --> 01:18:04,921
Sue, it's so good to see you.

971
01:18:05,340 --> 01:18:08,839
Lieutenant Bowen, this is Sue.

972
01:18:09,261 --> 01:18:09,960
HOWARD: Ma'am.

973
01:18:10,512 --> 01:18:13,133
You don't even know
my last name.

974
01:18:14,558 --> 01:18:16,634
I haven't been coming here
for two weeks

975
01:18:16,852 --> 01:18:18,476
about you and me, Owen.

976
01:18:18,896 --> 01:18:20,224
I came about this.

977
01:18:30,242 --> 01:18:31,487
Where'd you find this?

978
01:18:31,910 --> 01:18:33,487
Up at Pine Lodge.

979
01:18:35,038 --> 01:18:36,698
Here, come in my office.

980
01:18:39,376 --> 01:18:40,953
That night after you ditched me

981
01:18:41,379 --> 01:18:43,585
to go to the movies
with that army brat,

982
01:18:43,798 --> 01:18:45,208
I was out driving around.

983
01:18:47,176 --> 01:18:49,667
I saw something crash.

984
01:18:49,888 --> 01:18:51,964
I went up there,

985
01:18:52,182 --> 01:18:53,806
and there was something
in the trees,

986
01:18:54,226 --> 01:18:56,468
but it was dark,
and I couldn't really see what.

987
01:18:56,728 --> 01:18:58,554
And then I found that.

988
01:19:00,399 --> 01:19:02,522
And you brought it to me.

989
01:19:12,954 --> 01:19:15,326
Sue, you never let me explain
about that night.

990
01:19:15,749 --> 01:19:17,907
I was supposed
to meet the colonel.

991
01:19:18,126 --> 01:19:20,498
He was ill, and his daughter
came to give me the message.

992
01:19:20,921 --> 01:19:22,201
Sure she did.

993
01:19:22,423 --> 01:19:24,665
You completely misunderstood
the situation.

994
01:19:25,092 --> 01:19:26,835
Sure I did.

995
01:19:27,261 --> 01:19:29,834
You are the sun
and the moon to me, Sue.

996
01:19:31,432 --> 01:19:33,092
The sun and the moon.

997
01:20:27,993 --> 01:20:29,368
- Boo!
- Aah!

998
01:20:29,787 --> 01:20:33,915
You really should get in the habit
of locking your door.

999
01:20:38,838 --> 01:20:40,166
Oh, well.

1000
01:20:42,718 --> 01:20:44,046
It's too late.

1001
01:20:49,350 --> 01:20:50,630
Owen Crawford

1002
01:20:50,851 --> 01:20:53,306
is the best commanding officer,
boss, advisor,

1003
01:20:53,730 --> 01:20:56,980
and all-around good guy
that I've ever come to know.

1004
01:20:57,192 --> 01:20:58,390
And, Anne,

1005
01:20:58,735 --> 01:21:00,893
well, you're not
just marrying Owen.

1006
01:21:01,112 --> 01:21:03,188
You're getting
me and Marty, too,

1007
01:21:03,407 --> 01:21:06,823
and everyone else
who's ever served under him.

1008
01:21:07,036 --> 01:21:09,324
So I hope you like company.

1009
01:21:09,538 --> 01:21:12,029
T o Owen and Anne...

1010
01:21:12,416 --> 01:21:14,124
congratulations.

1011
01:21:15,962 --> 01:21:17,670
(piano playing
The Way You Look Tonight )

1012
01:21:23,887 --> 01:21:25,595
Dance with me.

1013
01:21:26,014 --> 01:21:28,683
(giggling)

1014
01:21:31,395 --> 01:21:33,103
I can't believe it.

1015
01:21:58,508 --> 01:22:00,251
You can pour one
for me, too, Dad.

1016
01:22:03,847 --> 01:22:07,975
If I didn't think that it'd
break my daughter's heart,

1017
01:22:08,185 --> 01:22:10,391
I'd kill you where you stand.

1018
01:22:10,604 --> 01:22:13,095
But it really would
break her heart.

1019
01:22:14,817 --> 01:22:16,809
You know what I'd like
as a wedding present?

1020
01:22:17,028 --> 01:22:20,397
- I'd like to be a major.
- What?

1021
01:22:20,615 --> 01:22:21,943
A major. Anything less,

1022
01:22:22,367 --> 01:22:25,036
and it wouldn't be right
when you put me in charge

1023
01:22:25,245 --> 01:22:27,071
of your little project
at Wright Field.

1024
01:22:27,289 --> 01:22:29,162
That project is mine.

1025
01:22:29,374 --> 01:22:32,743
You won't see the inside
of that laboratory.

1026
01:22:32,962 --> 01:22:34,420
I disagree.

1027
01:22:40,094 --> 01:22:41,837
It's an alloy unknown on this planet.

1028
01:22:42,263 --> 01:22:44,884
There's no translation, ancient
or modern, for the language.

1029
01:22:45,308 --> 01:22:49,519
It was found at Pine Lodge,
at the crash site.

1030
01:22:53,942 --> 01:22:56,314
Either you give me
exactly what I want,

1031
01:22:56,654 --> 01:22:58,397
or I'll go public with this.

1032
01:22:58,656 --> 01:23:01,526
I'll bring your flying saucer
crashing down on your head...

1033
01:23:01,868 --> 01:23:03,944
Dad.

1034
01:23:10,168 --> 01:23:14,497
Enjoy your new promotion.

1035
01:23:17,259 --> 01:23:19,465
Oh, and, uh...

1036
01:23:19,679 --> 01:23:21,339
I'd never do anything to hurt Anne.

1037
01:23:21,681 --> 01:23:23,720
She's the sun and the moon to me.

1038
01:23:31,691 --> 01:23:32,936
Hey, Tyler,

1039
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:35,981
what do I have to do
to get a refill in here today?

1040
01:23:36,405 --> 01:23:39,109
Well, just hang on a minute,
will you, Larry?

1041
01:23:42,203 --> 01:23:43,151
Sally will be right there.

1042
01:23:43,371 --> 01:23:46,372
(radio plays)

1043
01:23:52,130 --> 01:23:53,244
Sally?

1044
01:23:56,718 --> 01:23:58,260
Sally, honey, you all right?

1045
01:23:58,679 --> 01:24:00,387
I'll be out in just a minute.

1046
01:24:23,038 --> 01:24:24,947
Honey, what's the matter
with you?

1047
01:24:25,166 --> 01:24:27,039
Oh, hell, Tyler.

1048
01:24:31,589 --> 01:24:33,332
I'm pregnant.

1049
01:24:33,758 --> 01:24:35,964
Well, Fred'll be proud.

1050
01:24:39,431 --> 01:24:42,681
Oh. Honey, I'm sorry.

1051
01:25:05,960 --> 01:25:08,664
My mother always talked to me
a lot about the sky.

1052
01:25:10,590 --> 01:25:12,915
She liked to watch
the clouds in the day

1053
01:25:13,134 --> 01:25:15,589
and the stars at night...

1054
01:25:15,804 --> 01:25:17,464
especially the stars.

1055
01:25:23,103 --> 01:25:26,472
We would play a game sometimes...

1056
01:25:26,732 --> 01:25:30,350
a game called
"What's Beyond the Sky?"

1057
01:25:36,743 --> 01:25:40,028
We would imagine darkness
or a blinding light

1058
01:25:40,414 --> 01:25:44,032
or something else that
we didn't know how to name.

1059
01:25:44,251 --> 01:25:47,951
But. of course.
that was just a game.

1060
01:25:48,172 --> 01:25:50,330
There's nothing beyond the sky.

1061
01:25:50,550 --> 01:25:54,133
The sky just is.
and it goes on and on.

1062
01:25:54,345 --> 01:25:56,717
and we play
all of our games beneath it.

1063
01:25:56,973 --> 01:25:59,096
#. Stay all night, stay a little longer #.

1064
01:25:59,309 --> 01:26:01,385
#. Dance all night, dance a little longer #.

1065
01:26:01,603 --> 01:26:03,013
#. Pull off your coat
and throw it in the corner #.

1066
01:26:03,730 --> 01:26:07,562
#. I don't see why
you don't stay a little longer #.
