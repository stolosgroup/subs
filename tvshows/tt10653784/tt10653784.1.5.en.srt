00:00:06,229 --> 00:00:08,965
<i>Good afternoon,
followers! Gossip Girl here,</i>

3
00:00:09,049 --> 00:00:13,213
<i>your one and only, etcetera,
amen. Oscar Wilde once said,</i>

4
00:00:13,297 --> 00:00:16,730
<i>"Give a man a mask,
and he will tell you the truth,"</i>

5
00:00:16,814 --> 00:00:19,116
<i>which is why I love Halloween.</i>

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,921
<i>Because what was once created
to honor the dead</i>

7
00:00:22,005 --> 00:00:24,630
<i>tends to leave bodies
in its wake.</i>

8
00:00:24,714 --> 00:00:26,921
<i>For when you don your disguise,</i>

9
00:00:27,005 --> 00:00:28,630
<i>- the false sense of security it provides...</i>
- Yo! Watch it!

10
00:00:28,714 --> 00:00:30,973
<i>- ...always leads to loose lips</i>
- Fuck off, kid.

11
00:00:31,057 --> 00:00:32,926
<i>That'll sink
both friends...</i>

12
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:35,981
<i>...and relationships before dawn's early light.</i>

13
00:00:36,065 --> 00:00:36,816
- Come on, bring it!
- Fucking asshole.

14
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,702
<i>But I don't wanna spoil the fun.</i>

15
00:00:38,786 --> 00:00:40,713
<i>After all, the biggest scares</i>

16
00:00:40,797 --> 00:00:42,919
<i>are the ones
you never see coming.</i>

17
00:00:44,495 --> 00:00:46,137
<i>See you on the other side,</i>

18
00:00:46,221 --> 00:00:47,922
<i>dead or alive.</i>

19
00:00:52,753 --> 00:00:54,380
Okay.

20
00:00:54,464 --> 00:00:56,255
That might have been
the best one all week.

21
00:00:56,339 --> 00:00:58,505
We can't do it at school again.

22
00:00:58,589 --> 00:01:01,796
- That's what you say every time.
- Yeah, well, if we got caught...

23
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:05,255
Your generation always
feel so guilty after they come.

24
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:06,796
- Hmm.
- So sweet.

25
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,380
I'll see you tonight?

26
00:01:09,464 --> 00:01:11,755
Inside my apartment
for a change?

27
00:01:11,839 --> 00:01:14,380
Ah, you didn't like
the fire escape or the roof

28
00:01:14,464 --> 00:01:15,675
- or the stoop, huh?
- Hmm.

29
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:24,213
♪  ♪

30
00:01:24,297 --> 00:01:25,630
Hey, girl.

31
00:01:25,714 --> 00:01:27,510
Hi.

32
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:30,088
- Hey.
- Hi.

33
00:01:30,172 --> 00:01:33,213
They always find each other,
like magnets.

34
00:01:33,297 --> 00:01:36,718
Consider me on the other side.
Repelled.

35
00:01:38,005 --> 00:01:40,296
- Come on.
- So, where are we headed? Dover Street Market

36
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,213
- or Thai Diner?
- Did you forget our plans or...

37
00:01:42,297 --> 00:01:44,755
I actually have to go visit
my grandma.

38
00:01:44,839 --> 00:01:46,255
- You can come if you want.
- I was talking,

39
00:01:46,339 --> 00:01:48,130
right? Those weren't just voices
in my head.

40
00:01:48,214 --> 00:01:50,338
Oh, no because the voice
in your head

41
00:01:50,422 --> 00:01:52,255
is probably screaming right now.

42
00:01:52,339 --> 00:01:54,051
Why are you guys sitting
at this table?

43
00:01:55,005 --> 00:01:56,588
I mean, they're... they're all
the same tables.

44
00:01:56,672 --> 00:01:59,421
- The same table?
- The same table? Okay, now.

45
00:01:59,505 --> 00:02:01,463
That, like everything
but your outfit,

46
00:02:01,547 --> 00:02:03,255
was carefully chosen.

47
00:02:03,339 --> 00:02:06,130
The way the light hits,
the proximity to the trash.

48
00:02:06,214 --> 00:02:07,088
The fact that people
have to uncomfortably

49
00:02:07,172 --> 00:02:09,463
turn their head to the left
to take us on.

50
00:02:09,547 --> 00:02:12,963
Hey, where... where's the brooch
that we said we'd shoot you wearing?

51
00:02:13,047 --> 00:02:15,135
Oh, do you mean
the Burmese ruby?

52
00:02:16,005 --> 00:02:17,796
Do you know they're called
genocide gems?

53
00:02:17,895 --> 00:02:19,639
Hmm. Who told you that?

54
00:02:20,714 --> 00:02:22,213
If Z had done her research,

55
00:02:22,297 --> 00:02:24,963
she would know that Cartier
doesn't use Burmese rubies.

56
00:02:25,047 --> 00:02:25,963
So there goes
that sponsored post.

57
00:02:26,047 --> 00:02:28,671
We could just hang around
the Shibui pool.

58
00:02:28,755 --> 00:02:31,255
You two have been spending
an awful lot of time together.

59
00:02:31,339 --> 00:02:32,838
Yeah. Well, Julien
is on a mission

60
00:02:32,922 --> 00:02:34,713
to show everybody
that we really are friends

61
00:02:34,797 --> 00:02:36,796
and what she said
at my birthday party wasn't just

62
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,671
some publicity stunt
to boost her followers.

63
00:02:37,755 --> 00:02:40,796
Which worked, by the way.

64
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,296
So, what are we doing
for Halloween?

65
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:45,630
I was thinking you, me, and Obie
could do something together?

66
00:02:45,714 --> 00:02:47,505
Someone will definitely take a
photo, and there's no better way

67
00:02:47,589 --> 00:02:50,171
to prove that things are great
between us than a group hang.

68
00:02:50,255 --> 00:02:51,963
Hashtag Disney+.

69
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:53,255
I kind of already agreed to go
with Obie

70
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:57,338
to this party one of the witches
from<i> Hocus Pocus</i> throws.

71
00:02:57,422 --> 00:03:00,624
Oh, um... Hulaween.
How could I forget?

72
00:03:01,255 --> 00:03:02,338
I'll just hang out
with you girls.

73
00:03:02,422 --> 00:03:04,296
If you mean to Hulaween,
then yes, of course.

74
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:05,588
This year's theme
is New York Legends.

75
00:03:05,672 --> 00:03:07,921
If you're not there, you're
basically admitting you're not one.

76
00:03:08,005 --> 00:03:10,046
Plus, this is the first
Halloween post-COVID.

77
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:11,213
So you're still defined
by that humiliating loss

78
00:03:11,297 --> 00:03:13,746
to Pippa Sykes and Bianca Breer
from the year before.

79
00:03:14,672 --> 00:03:15,380
Who?

80
00:03:15,464 --> 00:03:16,505
Two bland girls
from another school

81
00:03:16,589 --> 00:03:19,005
that want what JC has,

82
00:03:19,089 --> 00:03:22,421
except they're always too busy
fucking each other's boyfriends

83
00:03:22,505 --> 00:03:24,213
and pushing each other into fountains...

84
00:03:24,297 --> 00:03:27,088
...to get after it
and honestly, it's so basic.

85
00:03:27,172 --> 00:03:29,630
They might as well be bots.

86
00:03:29,714 --> 00:03:30,796
- But we still have to beat them.
- A couples contest?

87
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,380
Isn't that kinda middle school?

88
00:03:33,464 --> 00:03:34,963
Like, what, do you get a trophy
or something?

89
00:03:35,047 --> 00:03:37,630
A trophy? No, try your photo
on the landing pages

90
00:03:37,714 --> 00:03:40,755
of the holy trifecta: <i>Vogue, Harper's,</i> and<i> WWD.</i>

91
00:03:40,839 --> 00:03:43,630
Add Miss GG to that mix.

92
00:03:43,714 --> 00:03:45,838
Obie never said
anything about a couples costume.

93
00:03:45,922 --> 00:03:46,880
Well, no need to worry,

94
00:03:46,964 --> 00:03:49,546
'cause, uh, Aki and I
are gonna win.

95
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:52,546
We have picked the perfect
New York legends,

96
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:54,088
- Greta and Noah, yes.
- Ooh.

97
00:03:54,172 --> 00:03:56,713
- Ew.
- And unlike them at the Oscars,

98
00:03:56,797 --> 00:03:59,005
we will not be going home
empty-handed.

99
00:03:59,089 --> 00:04:00,421
So you and Aki...

100
00:04:00,505 --> 00:04:03,213
We are figuring things out,
slowly but surely,

101
00:04:03,297 --> 00:04:06,046
and, uh, with no interference,
and that's what counts.

102
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:07,671
Yeah. You need to think
of something great, JC,

103
00:04:07,755 --> 00:04:09,046
because you can't lose again.

104
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:11,171
Well, how am I supposed to do
a couples costume by myself?

105
00:04:11,255 --> 00:04:14,338
Couples are a dead binary.
Be Rihanna or Oprah.

106
00:04:14,422 --> 00:04:16,963
They don't even need last names,
let alone a partner to do anything.

107
00:04:17,047 --> 00:04:19,176
Why is everyone
on their phones?

108
00:04:19,964 --> 00:04:21,088
- Hey.
- You guys see what happened?

109
00:04:21,172 --> 00:04:22,588
Some kid brought a gun
to school.

110
00:04:22,672 --> 00:04:23,838
- Holy shit.
- You're back on Insta?

111
00:04:23,922 --> 00:04:26,755
Oh, my God! Of course,
it's Pippa and Bianca's school.

112
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:28,005
Now they're gonna get
the sympathy vote.

113
00:04:28,089 --> 00:04:29,380
<i>Can you believe it?</i>

114
00:04:29,464 --> 00:04:31,505
<i>My entire life flashed

115
00:04:31,589 --> 00:04:34,921

- Right in front of us.</i>

You need to take those barely
sentient succubi down

122
00:04:51,089 --> 00:04:52,838
before they wind up
on<i> This American Life,</i>

with that.

124
00:04:54,422 --> 00:04:55,380
So, what are you gonna do?

125
00:04:55,464 --> 00:04:56,921
You guys, a kid brought
a gun to school.

126
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:59,296
Doesn't that make
a costume contest

127
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:01,421
- seem a little frivolous?
- Or a good way to process.

128
00:05:01,505 --> 00:05:05,213
- Hmm.
- Maybe this is the year we forgo all of that?

129
00:05:05,297 --> 00:05:07,421
Hey, we don't have to go
if you don't want to.

130
00:05:07,505 --> 00:05:09,796
I mean, I wanna go, it's just
the dressing up part.

131
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,671
Do they know why he brought
a gun to school?

132
00:05:10,755 --> 00:05:13,666
Gossip Girl, of course.

133
00:05:14,297 --> 00:05:16,630
Nice to see you all.

134
00:05:16,714 --> 00:05:17,796
Some more than others.

135
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,005
If I didn't know any better,

136
00:05:19,089 --> 00:05:21,166
I'd think you've been
avoiding me.

137
00:05:21,547 --> 00:05:23,505
Seems you know pretty well, huh?

138
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:25,130
We're gonna be late
for practice.

139
00:05:25,214 --> 00:05:27,130
Remember? My dad and I
are gonna go see my grandma.

140
00:05:27,214 --> 00:05:29,624
Hmm. Dumbo Hall later?
Most of us.

141
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,874
Ah.

142
00:05:33,255 --> 00:05:37,171
What did I ever do to you
that you didn't ask for?

143
00:05:37,255 --> 00:05:38,838
- Give us some space?
- Ah.

144
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:40,838
So that's how it's gonna be.
Okay. So, wait,

145
00:05:40,922 --> 00:05:44,713
you fucked up fucking me
and I get the shaft?

146
00:05:44,797 --> 00:05:46,880
We apologized to each other,

147
00:05:46,964 --> 00:05:48,380
but you don't think you did
anything wrong.

148
00:05:48,464 --> 00:05:52,213
See, that's your thing, Max.
You never do anything wrong.

149
00:05:52,297 --> 00:05:55,171
You're all id all the time,
and, honestly,

150
00:05:55,255 --> 00:05:57,963
- my ego is just exhausted by it.
- Aw.

151
00:05:58,047 --> 00:06:01,749
Okay. Well, look, don't worry,
you can rest easy now.

152
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,963
Messy Max
still in effect.

153
00:06:06,047 --> 00:06:07,921
Seems to be back to normal
to me.

My sources say that
that student's family

167
00:06:41,922 --> 00:06:43,296
are big game hunters.

168
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,588
Like, they showed up strapped
to Christmas Mass.

169
00:06:45,672 --> 00:06:49,713
We're not responsible for what
every disturbed kid in Manhattan does.

170
00:06:49,797 --> 00:06:51,255
We are when that kid
was targeted

171
00:06:51,339 --> 00:06:53,213
in Gossip Girl-tagged photos.

172
00:06:53,297 --> 00:06:56,505
We inadvertently created
a platform for his bullies

173
00:06:56,589 --> 00:06:58,255
to publicly humiliate him

174
00:06:58,339 --> 00:07:01,338
and a forum for them to go off
in the comments.

175
00:07:01,422 --> 00:07:04,088
We can't control who tags us
and what they write on our posts.

176
00:07:04,172 --> 00:07:07,088
And it's because of Gossip Girl
that they were able to identify

177
00:07:07,172 --> 00:07:09,671
what happened and who was
behind it. In a way,

178
00:07:09,755 --> 00:07:11,291
we're kind of heroes.

179
00:07:12,339 --> 00:07:15,916
Okay, fine. Antiheroes,
like Batman.

180
00:07:16,797 --> 00:07:18,421
Just because it ended well
this time

181
00:07:18,505 --> 00:07:20,005
doesn't mean it will the next.

182
00:07:20,089 --> 00:07:22,421
I mean, don't you worry if we've
been too hasty on all of this?

183
00:07:22,505 --> 00:07:26,046
- Too rash?
- Define "all this," 'cause we've done, um,

184
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:29,630
many rash things: taking photos
of undressed teenagers

185
00:07:29,714 --> 00:07:32,255
from outside their window,
getting our friend fired?

186
00:07:32,339 --> 00:07:35,046
It started out as a small,
in-school social experiment.

187
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:38,296
But it's become
a citywide enterprise

188
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:40,296
that needs someone
to constantly babysit it.

189
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,963
I don't feel right
about it anymore.

190
00:07:42,047 --> 00:07:43,671
Wow, submits a story
to<i> The Paris Review</i> once.

191
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:46,838
This has nothing to do with whether
or not my story gets published.

192
00:07:46,922 --> 00:07:49,541
This is about real lives
at stake.

193
00:07:50,255 --> 00:07:52,296
We should take a break
from posting.

194
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,838
Seriously? Remember when you
couldn't take a day off?

195
00:07:54,922 --> 00:07:57,130
Now you wanna walk away?

196
00:07:57,214 --> 00:07:59,296
If this is
about finding extra time,

197
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,213
Wendy and I can pick up
more slack.

198
00:08:00,297 --> 00:08:02,963
I think we proved ourselves
last time.

199
00:08:03,047 --> 00:08:04,380
It's not that.

200
00:08:04,464 --> 00:08:06,463
What we're doing
has consequences.

201
00:08:06,547 --> 00:08:08,463
It's best
we take a break,

202
00:08:08,547 --> 00:08:11,963
see if things cool off,
and who knows?

203
00:08:12,047 --> 00:08:14,546
Maybe it existing
for that brief while

204
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:17,546
- made a difference.
- This isn't just your decision.

205
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:20,666
Sometimes even Batman
has to just be...

206
00:08:21,755 --> 00:08:23,124
Bruce whoever.

207
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:29,755
Regardless of what
Kate Jung Un thinks,

208
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:33,630
we have a say in this.
And we can do what we want.

209
00:08:33,714 --> 00:08:36,541
Wayne. Bruce Wayne.

210
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:40,296
You def beat your time.

211
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:43,380
I lucked out, man,
everybody was slower today.

212
00:08:43,464 --> 00:08:45,666
- Everyone's on edge.
- Yeah.

213
00:08:46,589 --> 00:08:49,255
I wish Julien hadn't told Zoya
about the couples costumes.

214
00:08:49,339 --> 00:08:50,505
Why?

215
00:08:50,589 --> 00:08:52,921
Everything's good between them.
You can relax.

216
00:08:53,005 --> 00:08:55,213
Maybe, uh, have a good time
with your girlfriend for a change?

217
00:08:55,297 --> 00:08:56,713
Okay, but see, you say
that word, and I'm like,

218
00:08:56,797 --> 00:08:58,088
"Okay, is she my girlfriend?

219
00:08:58,172 --> 00:09:00,671
Or are we just two people that
meet up for dinner occasionally?"

220
00:09:00,755 --> 00:09:03,130
Dude, don't worry.
It's only been a month.

221
00:09:03,214 --> 00:09:05,546
- Things move slower where she's from.
- Yeah.

222
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:07,671
You and Julien lost your
virginities to each other so quick,

223
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:08,880
no one even knew
it had happened.

224
00:09:08,964 --> 00:09:10,630
Yeah, but I'm not even talking
about sex, dude.

225
00:09:10,714 --> 00:09:12,005
It's like when we first met...

226
00:09:12,089 --> 00:09:13,338
Thank you. When we first met,
she was so full of ideas

227
00:09:13,422 --> 00:09:16,421
and... and thoughts
and we'd talk for hours,

228
00:09:16,505 --> 00:09:17,255
and now, it's like...

229
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:19,546
It's like I just
monologue at her

230
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:21,546
and then wait for her
to interrupt me.

231
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:24,088
Uh, maybe you're
afraid of it now that it's real?

232
00:09:24,172 --> 00:09:26,046
All the obstacles
that were in your way are gone.

233
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:28,838
And you finally have free time
to get to know each other now.

234
00:09:28,922 --> 00:09:31,708
Which can be scary.

235
00:09:33,505 --> 00:09:35,074
Unless this is about Julien...

236
00:09:36,005 --> 00:09:37,463
No one would blame you
if you still...

237
00:09:37,547 --> 00:09:38,916
No, I like Zoya.

238
00:09:39,755 --> 00:09:41,724
It's just some growing pains,
that's all.

239
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,421
I'm sorry.
No matter how many buses I'm on,

240
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:52,296
I can never really manage
to find my balance.

241
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:53,921
Uh, no, you're good.
It's my fault.

242
00:09:54,005 --> 00:09:56,208
I was on my phone.

243
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,249
Yeah. What's a Gossip Girl?

244
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:03,213
Hey, stranger!
Just creeping on my phone?

245
00:10:03,297 --> 00:10:05,171
I'm sorry. I... I don't really
have any phone etiquette.

246
00:10:05,255 --> 00:10:08,130
And it's, uh, it's mainly
because I only have one of these

247
00:10:08,214 --> 00:10:10,421
in case of emergency.

248
00:10:10,505 --> 00:10:12,130
So, you really don't read
Gossip Girl?

249
00:10:12,214 --> 00:10:13,880
No. And, uh,
no offense or anything.

250
00:10:13,964 --> 00:10:15,255
It just doesn't really
seem like my thing.

251
00:10:15,339 --> 00:10:17,421
Well, you must not be from here.

252
00:10:17,505 --> 00:10:20,291
No, I am. I actually, uh,
go to school near here.

253
00:10:21,255 --> 00:10:24,104
Oh, I hope it's not the school
I've been hearing about all day.

254
00:10:24,797 --> 00:10:25,588
Oh, man, are you okay?

255
00:10:25,672 --> 00:10:28,463
It was just pretty intense,
you know.

256
00:10:28,547 --> 00:10:30,213
Uh, I just feel pretty bad
that I didn't, like,

257
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:33,463
- see it coming.
- How could you?

258
00:10:33,547 --> 00:10:35,296
Well, I'm on a scholarship,
like Jared is.

259
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:39,213
And, uh, you know, at a school
like ours,

260
00:10:39,297 --> 00:10:42,588
that can either give you
a superiority complex

261
00:10:42,672 --> 00:10:44,255
or add to you feeling different.

262
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:45,755
And, you know, mix that in
with evil rich kids

263
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,963
that are exploiting that anxiety
and pushing those buttons

264
00:10:49,047 --> 00:10:50,963
and using us
to make themselves feel better

265
00:10:51,047 --> 00:10:51,963
about their privilege?

266
00:10:52,047 --> 00:10:55,463
Yeah, I'm not that surprised
that it escalated.

267
00:10:55,547 --> 00:10:58,213
And if that Gossip Girl
is what it sounds like,

268
00:10:58,297 --> 00:11:00,838
you know, I imagine
that probably made it worse.

269
00:11:00,922 --> 00:11:03,491
Yeah. And I would be the
first person to agree with you.

270
00:11:04,047 --> 00:11:05,833
So, why look at it?

271
00:11:06,297 --> 00:11:09,588
I guess because everybody does.

272
00:11:09,672 --> 00:11:12,255
Well, you know what? Uh, now
you know someone who doesn't.

273
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:15,171
Or you're getting to know
someone, at least. Uh, Simon Rivera.

274
00:11:15,255 --> 00:11:17,296
Uh, Zoya Lott.
It... It's nice meeting you.

275
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:19,005
I would keep talking,
but this is my stop.

276
00:11:19,089 --> 00:11:21,378
Well, maybe I'll see you on here
again some time.

277
00:11:28,672 --> 00:11:30,588
- Hey!
- Hey! I'm just here to change.

278
00:11:30,672 --> 00:11:31,755
I'll be going out.

279
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:32,588
Well, you gotta eat somewhere,
right?

280
00:11:32,672 --> 00:11:35,671
I'm making miso salmon
and sushi rice.

281
00:11:35,755 --> 00:11:37,124
It's your favorite.

282
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:40,630
Why are you staring at me?

283
00:11:40,714 --> 00:11:44,296
I don't remember the last time
you cooked anything.

284
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:49,088
I cooked last Christmas Eve,
or the one before that.

285
00:11:49,172 --> 00:11:52,546
- Um, I'm not that hungry, but...
- Oh.

286
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:55,505
...I guess I should be happy
that you got out of bed...

287
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:57,791
even though you didn't bother
to shower.

288
00:11:58,297 --> 00:11:59,546
Um, I'll have leftovers
tomorrow.

289
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:01,713
- Um, actually, honey, I...
- What?

290
00:12:01,797 --> 00:12:03,921
I... I need to talk to you
about something.

291
00:12:04,005 --> 00:12:04,588
Um, I have some news.

292
00:12:04,672 --> 00:12:07,171
Has the company been bailed out?

293
00:12:07,255 --> 00:12:12,255
Um... We are going to have
to move home.

294
00:12:12,339 --> 00:12:14,708
- We are home.
- No, to Cornwall.

295
00:12:15,339 --> 00:12:17,630
That is not my home.
That's your home.

296
00:12:17,714 --> 00:12:19,880
And after way too many years
being stuck in that place,

297
00:12:19,964 --> 00:12:22,005
I am never going back there.

298
00:12:22,089 --> 00:12:24,916
Plus, Cornwall is two hours
away. I can't comm...

299
00:12:27,089 --> 00:12:30,546
Oh. You wanna pull me
out of school too.

300
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:32,921
- Yes, Audrey.
- And of course,

301
00:12:33,005 --> 00:12:34,734
you didn't actually
make me dinner.

302
00:12:35,214 --> 00:12:36,005
Of course not.

303
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:38,755
It's never an honest gesture
with you.

304
00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:40,421
Just another selfish act.

305
00:12:40,505 --> 00:12:41,505
You know what? I thought I would
do something nice for you,

how did you do it?

00:19:11,755 --> 00:19:14,630
Uh, Cordelia and Goneril?

459
00:19:14,714 --> 00:19:17,171
- The Lohans, two Lohans.
- Elena and Lila.

460
00:19:17,255 --> 00:19:18,130
- All of the Olsens.
- This is a joke, right?

461
00:19:18,214 --> 00:19:20,005
If I have to go along with this,
you do too.

462
00:19:20,089 --> 00:19:23,833
- We'll find the right look.
- So stoked.

463
00:19:24,172 --> 00:19:26,583
- Ooh.
- Ugh, God.

464
00:19:26,672 --> 00:19:28,338
Wow!

465
00:19:28,422 --> 00:19:29,546
I didn't know people
from Constance

466
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:31,166
even knew about this place.

467
00:19:32,214 --> 00:19:34,380
- Did you hear what happened to me?
- Us.

468
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:36,213
Do you mean what happened
near you?

469
00:19:36,297 --> 00:19:37,588
Do you know what else
will be happening near me?

470
00:19:37,672 --> 00:19:40,505
- The press crowning me winner when I show up to Hulaween...
- We.

471
00:19:40,589 --> 00:19:41,880
- ...with the perfect costume.
- ...umes.

472
00:19:41,964 --> 00:19:44,041
That'll pale in comparison
with ours.

473
00:19:44,464 --> 00:19:45,671
Because we have a better story.

474
00:19:45,755 --> 00:19:48,671
Blood being thicker
than Franzia, after all.

475
00:19:48,755 --> 00:19:51,564
I'll see you from the dais...

476
00:19:51,797 --> 00:19:53,166
...whoever you are.

477
00:19:54,422 --> 00:19:56,005
Well,
that deserves a drink.

478
00:19:56,089 --> 00:19:57,666
Hmm?

479
00:19:57,839 --> 00:19:59,333
Ladies...

480
00:20:01,589 --> 00:20:05,338
<i>Spotted. We
never could have predicted this,</i>

481
00:20:05,422 --> 00:20:06,921
<i>but looks like JC and Z...</i>

482
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:10,713
<i>...really have buried
the hatchet.</i>

483
00:20:10,797 --> 00:20:14,838
<i>Too bad Z buried it
in Obie's back.</i>

484
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:17,171
Remember when I said
not to worry?

485
00:20:17,255 --> 00:20:20,499
I think you should worry.

486
00:20:40,672 --> 00:20:41,546
<i>Why are you WhatsApp-ing me?</i>

487
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:43,880
Because I wanted you to see
how angry I am.

488
00:20:43,964 --> 00:20:45,630
We said we would stop posting.

489
00:20:45,714 --> 00:20:48,005
<i>Technically, you said
we would stop posting,</i>

490
00:20:48,089 --> 00:20:50,546
<i>but then we got a photo
of Zoya and that rando.</i>

491
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:54,130
<i>And then this photo,
Obie alone,</i>

492
00:20:54,214 --> 00:20:57,630
<i>sadder than sad Keanu.
How could we not post it?</i>

493
00:20:57,714 --> 00:21:00,541
<i>I was just making a meme.
Here's Lobie eating pie.</i>

494
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:04,088
<i>Here's Lobie on a horse.</i>

495
00:21:04,172 --> 00:21:06,046
<i>Here's Lobie
with Bernie Mittens. And...</i>

496
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:08,833
Please just stop.

497
00:21:11,172 --> 00:21:13,796
- Hello.
- Ms. Keller? Kate?

498
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,880
Uh, sorry.
Now is not a good time.

499
00:21:15,964 --> 00:21:16,458
Uh, it's Nick.

500
00:21:16,714 --> 00:21:19,458
Lott. Zoya's dad.

501
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:22,880
Oh, hi. Uh, how did you, um...

502
00:21:22,964 --> 00:21:24,171
<i>Uh, it's on
the emergency phone tree.</i>

503
00:21:24,255 --> 00:21:25,755
<i>I hope you don't mind me
calling.</i>

504
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:27,796
You know, I saw the news
this morning about that kid

505
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,880
at the other school and well...

506
00:21:29,964 --> 00:21:32,171
<i>Did Zoya say
anything about it?</i>

507
00:21:32,255 --> 00:21:35,130
Uh, people are blaming
this Gossip Girl.

508
00:21:35,214 --> 00:21:38,755
I know they've talked
about Zoya, too.

509
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:41,505
Actually, I was thinking
you could ask her.

510
00:21:41,589 --> 00:21:45,046
Yeah, back in Buffalo, she was...
Just so focused on school.

511
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:46,630
Always the extra credit kid.

512
00:21:46,714 --> 00:21:49,088
And now she's going out
all the time

513
00:21:49,172 --> 00:21:50,546
with her sister, boyfriend.

514
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:53,630
And my mom suggested
that I get a tutor.

515
00:21:53,714 --> 00:21:56,755
<i>And, you know, just to get Zoya
back on track.</i>

516
00:21:56,839 --> 00:21:59,916
And as you're her
favorite teacher, I thought...

517
00:22:00,714 --> 00:22:03,999
I have been wanting
to get more involved at school.

518
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:06,463
What are you doing
after school tomorrow?

519
00:22:10,964 --> 00:22:13,708
Tomorrow? Um, nothing.

520
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:21,880
For fuck's s...

521
00:22:21,964 --> 00:22:23,671
Tried you a few times
last night.

522
00:22:23,755 --> 00:22:25,380
Phone's on "do not disturb."

523
00:22:25,464 --> 00:22:26,963
You and your dad
must be pretty broken up

524
00:22:27,047 --> 00:22:28,936
about your Pops
leaving the house, huh?

525
00:22:29,755 --> 00:22:31,171
We're gonna be late to class.

526
00:22:31,255 --> 00:22:33,255
- Said you never.
- What is this, huh?

527
00:22:33,339 --> 00:22:36,130
I'm doing great
for the first time in weeks

528
00:22:36,214 --> 00:22:38,505
with just my own chemistry
and you're draining my dopamine.

529
00:22:38,589 --> 00:22:40,671
Maybe there's a teacher
you can fuck to get it back.

530
00:22:40,755 --> 00:22:42,880
Oh, okay. I see.
So this isn't a haze,

531
00:22:42,964 --> 00:22:44,463
it's a visit
from the purity police?

532
00:22:44,547 --> 00:22:46,671
This can ruin his career, Max.

533
00:22:46,755 --> 00:22:49,213
This can follow you around
forever. For life.

534
00:22:49,297 --> 00:22:52,541
Well, uh, if you want me
to stop so bad...

535
00:22:53,422 --> 00:22:55,124
you can always make me.

536
00:22:55,755 --> 00:22:57,213
I'm just trying to be
your friend here.

537
00:22:57,297 --> 00:23:01,380
No, but you're not my friend,
Ak. Are you?

538
00:23:01,464 --> 00:23:04,380
I'm just someone you can project
your fantasies onto.

539
00:23:04,464 --> 00:23:06,338
And now that your girlfriend
wants me out of the picture,

540
00:23:06,422 --> 00:23:09,338
you've realized how bored
and basic you are without me.

541
00:23:09,422 --> 00:23:11,208
And that's not my fault.

542
00:23:13,255 --> 00:23:16,166
You tell a single soul,
what you know...

543
00:23:17,964 --> 00:23:18,880
and what I do to you next
will be.

544
00:23:18,964 --> 00:23:23,083
♪

545
00:23:28,797 --> 00:23:30,171
♪

546
00:23:30,255 --> 00:23:32,713
- Everything all right?
- Yeah, um,

547
00:23:32,797 --> 00:23:33,755
I just... I can't hang out
after school.

548
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:36,963
My dad got me into some sort
of tutoring session.

549
00:23:37,047 --> 00:23:38,755
Well, for the next half hour,
we're your tutors, got it?

550
00:23:38,839 --> 00:23:40,088
Why are we doing this?

551
00:23:40,172 --> 00:23:42,505
She should just do her thing
with Obie

552
00:23:42,589 --> 00:23:44,380
and you should do yours, alone.

553
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:45,921
The sister thing is cute.

554
00:23:46,005 --> 00:23:46,671
It's only cute
if the idea is cute.

555
00:23:46,755 --> 00:23:48,624
Hmm. Swipe.

556
00:23:50,797 --> 00:23:53,630
The costumes,
they can't just be cool.

557
00:23:53,714 --> 00:23:56,255
They have to tell a story.
Specifically, our story.

558
00:23:56,339 --> 00:24:00,171
Taking control of the narrative
is about owning the accusations.

559
00:24:00,255 --> 00:24:02,588
We should play into what people
are saying about us.

560
00:24:02,672 --> 00:24:05,296
So, do a legendary rivalry?

561
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:06,463
- Exactly.
- All right.

562
00:24:06,547 --> 00:24:09,088
Wink at the rumors
while also putting them to bed.

563
00:24:09,172 --> 00:24:10,796
What if we did
SJP and Kim Cattrall

564
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,713
or... or Keke Palmer
and that man?

565
00:24:14,755 --> 00:24:17,588
- Bey and Solange.
- Oh, my God. Duh!

566
00:24:17,672 --> 00:24:19,463
Wait! But they're not rivals.

567
00:24:19,547 --> 00:24:21,713
- They're really close, right?
- Are they though?

568
00:24:21,797 --> 00:24:24,130
I mean, they are sisters
in the same field, right?

569
00:24:24,214 --> 00:24:25,463
And the world is constantly
trying to see

570
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:26,088
- what's up between them, so it's perfect.
- Right.

571
00:24:26,172 --> 00:24:28,296
That's exactly our story.

572
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:30,005
This is gonna be
our defining moment.

573
00:24:30,089 --> 00:24:32,088
Okay. So obviously,
you're Beyoncé.

574
00:24:32,172 --> 00:24:34,755
<i>- Lemonade</i> or<i> Homecoming?</i>
- Hmm. Too expected.

575
00:24:34,839 --> 00:24:36,963
What about one of the royal
looks from<i> Black is King?</i>

576
00:24:37,047 --> 00:24:38,505
Yes!

577
00:24:38,589 --> 00:24:41,833
You, guys, if we want
really good attention,

578
00:24:42,547 --> 00:24:44,213
we do the elevator.

579
00:24:44,297 --> 00:24:47,296
- Good idea.
- Sister sticking up for sister, that is perfect.

580
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:49,380
And we know
you look great in orange.

581
00:24:49,464 --> 00:24:51,171
Yeah, because buffalo wings
or Buffalo Exchange?

582
00:24:51,255 --> 00:24:54,338
Yeah. Got it.

583
00:24:54,422 --> 00:24:57,005
- Um, hey, that's my phone.
- I found the guy you were looking for

584
00:24:57,089 --> 00:24:58,005
when you lied
about texting your dad.

585
00:24:58,089 --> 00:24:59,874
Too bad he's private.

586
00:25:01,714 --> 00:25:03,505
Is that the guy from last night?

587
00:25:03,589 --> 00:25:05,130
Simon Rivera, yeah.

588
00:25:05,214 --> 00:25:07,255
Are things that bad with Obie?

589
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:09,463
No. Uh, it's kind of nice to have
a friend of my own for a change.

590
00:25:09,547 --> 00:25:11,546
And Simon and I have a lot
of things in common.

591
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:14,713
You and Obie have similar
interests too, right?

592
00:25:14,797 --> 00:25:16,963
It's just sometimes I wonder
if he actually

593
00:25:17,047 --> 00:25:17,880
cares about the things
he talks about

594
00:25:17,964 --> 00:25:20,333
or if he just thinks
that he's supposed to.

595
00:25:20,755 --> 00:25:22,130
Like why go to a talk

596
00:25:22,214 --> 00:25:24,291
if you could just
do something, you know?

597
00:25:25,922 --> 00:25:28,958
I, uh, I gotta get back.

598
00:25:29,589 --> 00:25:30,958
Okay.

599
00:25:32,214 --> 00:25:33,171
Send me your sizes, we'll do
a fitting tomorrow morning.

600
00:25:33,255 --> 00:25:35,749
Bye.

601
00:25:38,714 --> 00:25:40,505
You just missed her.

602
00:25:40,589 --> 00:25:41,796
Yeah, I see that.
I came looking for you actually.

603
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,124
I need your help.

604
00:25:47,547 --> 00:25:49,338
I wanna know what's going on.

605
00:25:49,422 --> 00:25:52,380
His name is Simon Rivera,
and that's all I know.

606
00:25:52,464 --> 00:25:53,796
I'm sorry, Obie.

607
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:56,791
Don't be. I'm not.

608
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:04,208
Hello, yes, this is Otto
and Helena Bergmann's son.

609
00:26:05,547 --> 00:26:06,838
Yes, Obie, that's right.
I was hoping

610
00:26:06,922 --> 00:26:09,421
that you could, uh,
maybe do me a favor.

611
00:26:09,505 --> 00:26:12,171
<i>- What's up, Audge?</i>

I have no idea

What? Would you rather me

But you won't.

that you hit on me.

642

And after I said no, stalked me.

643

And I had no choice, but to ask
your friend Max for help.

He owns half of it, right?

743
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:45,380
Maybe I should call him,
ask him to buy out your share?

744
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:49,458
Audrey, p... please.

745
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:52,171
Please don't involve him
in this.

746
00:32:52,255 --> 00:32:55,463
Why? He actually cares about me.

747
00:32:55,547 --> 00:32:56,380
He wouldn't pull me
out of school

748

his own life.

You can live wherever you want,
Katherine,

00:41:18,589 --> 00:41:20,296
We've been planning
this group costume

920
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:23,963
with P and B since last year
and the pictures complete.

921
00:41:24,047 --> 00:41:25,416
I'm Dan Humphrey and...

922
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:28,499
I'm Chuck Bass.

923
00:41:29,714 --> 00:41:30,796
What's gotten into you?

924
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:34,546
So, fine, they won't win,
but look at how cute they are.

925
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:36,755
Cute doesn't get you
on the cover of<i> Vogue.</i>

926
00:41:36,839 --> 00:41:39,880
You'd be lucky
if he got you on PopSugar.

927
00:41:39,964 --> 00:41:42,671
Why are you basic-bombing us?

928
00:41:42,755 --> 00:41:45,046
You turned our frenemies
into common couples.

929
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:46,505
Haven't you ever heard
of sisterhood?

930
00:41:46,589 --> 00:41:48,838
If one of us goes down,
we all go down together.

931
00:41:52,589 --> 00:41:53,880
But why are you mad?

932
00:41:53,964 --> 00:41:54,546
They would have
been nowhere before.

933
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:56,199
Then maybe they deserve to be.

934
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:00,505
Do you mean Pippa and Bianca
or our girls?

935
00:42:11,047 --> 00:42:13,291
Um, can I meet you inside?

936
00:42:13,589 --> 00:42:14,999
Yeah.

937
00:42:23,547 --> 00:42:26,380
Hey. You keep popping
up where I least expect you to.

938
00:42:26,464 --> 00:42:28,421
Well, I volunteer for the
New York Restoration Project.

939
00:42:28,505 --> 00:42:31,255
So, technically, I am working.

940
00:42:31,339 --> 00:42:32,880
Well, um, I don't know
if you heard,

941
00:42:32,964 --> 00:42:34,880
but we crashed Gossip Girl.

942
00:42:34,964 --> 00:42:36,671
Yeah. She posted a pic of us
from yesterday

943
00:42:36,755 --> 00:42:37,880
and it broke the internet.
She's gone.

944
00:42:37,964 --> 00:42:41,749
I admit, uh, you got me curious.
I... I looked into her but...

945
00:42:42,547 --> 00:42:45,546
what do you think it is
that she's actually trying

946
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:46,671
to do?

947
00:42:46,755 --> 00:42:49,046
- You want to know?
- You know, you actually mentioned

948
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:50,421
that you weren't interested
in her,

949
00:42:50,505 --> 00:42:52,546
and yet you keep
bringing her up.

950
00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:56,624
Must be something about it
that you find interesting.

951
00:42:58,172 --> 00:42:59,630
Did you know
Mr. Caparros's cousins

952
00:42:59,714 --> 00:43:01,213
have a winery in Argentina?

953
00:43:01,297 --> 00:43:04,380
- I did not. No.
- Yeah. He told my mom about it

954
00:43:04,464 --> 00:43:06,255
last year
at the St. Jude's fundraiser.

955
00:43:06,339 --> 00:43:07,588
- Okay.
- She bought a case to be kind.

956
00:43:07,672 --> 00:43:11,208
The wine tastes like shit,
but the website's actually nice.

957
00:43:15,047 --> 00:43:16,588
Hmm.

958
00:43:16,672 --> 00:43:19,963
Why does it feel so good
exposing the truth about people?

959
00:43:20,047 --> 00:43:22,874
It does, doesn't it?

960
00:43:23,714 --> 00:43:25,583
♪

961
00:43:32,047 --> 00:43:34,458
Hey! You found it.

962
00:43:35,130 --> 00:43:37,921
You gave me the address,
and I have a phone.

963
00:43:38,005 --> 00:43:39,671
Right. Welcome.

964
00:43:39,755 --> 00:43:41,880
Um, this place
has a great happy hour.

965
00:43:41,964 --> 00:43:44,130
It goes until 8:00.
I come in here like every night.

966
00:43:44,214 --> 00:43:46,713
Everything on draft
is half price for Halloween.

967
00:43:46,797 --> 00:43:48,963
And I remember you saying
you don't like hops.

968
00:43:49,047 --> 00:43:51,421
So, I was thinking maybe
the pilsner?

969
00:43:51,505 --> 00:43:54,666
- It's a microbrew from Vermont.
- Uh, I'm good with water.

970
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:55,630
Okay. They have that.

971
00:43:55,714 --> 00:43:58,088
- They also have wine.
- I'm sorry.

972
00:43:58,172 --> 00:43:59,505
I'm confused.
I thought we were meeting

973
00:43:59,589 --> 00:44:01,255
to talk about the future
of Gossip Girl.

974
00:44:01,339 --> 00:44:03,546
I'm sorry
if I gave that impression.

975
00:44:03,630 --> 00:44:06,963
You texted me, "We need to talk
about the future."

976
00:44:07,047 --> 00:44:11,880
Right. Well...
...uh, sure. Gossip Girl.

977
00:44:11,964 --> 00:44:14,088
You want it over, it's over.

978
00:44:14,172 --> 00:44:17,463
But if it is, I want to talk
about what might take its place.

979
00:44:17,547 --> 00:44:20,380
You... you're not angry
that I shut it down?

980
00:44:20,464 --> 00:44:22,921
I didn't agree to go
on this journey with you

981
00:44:23,005 --> 00:44:24,963
because I thought
it was a great idea.

982
00:44:25,047 --> 00:44:27,796
I did it because I like
spending time with you

983
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:28,963
and I was thinking
maybe we can...

984
00:44:29,047 --> 00:44:31,333
Yeah. I...

985
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:33,749
I get it.

986
00:44:34,422 --> 00:44:39,291
Um, Jordan, you are so sweet.

987
00:44:40,255 --> 00:44:43,005
Uh, you're one
of the only truly good people

988
00:44:43,089 --> 00:44:44,338
in my life, maybe the only one.

989
00:44:44,422 --> 00:44:46,958
You need more people
in your life.

990
00:44:47,547 --> 00:44:49,380
Uh, I really can't imagine

991
00:44:49,464 --> 00:44:52,505
anyone else by my side
these last few months.

992
00:44:52,589 --> 00:44:55,546
- But the timing...
- Right. Of course.

993
00:44:55,630 --> 00:44:57,880
The... the timing.

994
00:44:57,964 --> 00:44:59,088
I should go.

995
00:44:59,172 --> 00:45:02,296
I'm supposed to help out
a friend pass out candy.

996
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:04,796
That's cool. You need any help?

997
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:07,458
I think we can handle it.

998
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:15,124
Kate, I don't want Gossip Girl
to be done.

999
00:45:15,964 --> 00:45:17,546
I've grown to like it.

1000
00:45:17,630 --> 00:45:19,421
Makes people talk face to face.

1001
00:45:19,505 --> 00:45:22,338
It forces conversations
that would never be had,

1002
00:45:22,422 --> 00:45:23,713
even this one.

1003
00:45:23,797 --> 00:45:25,921
What you've done,
it isn't just important,

1004
00:45:26,005 --> 00:45:28,208
it's vital.

1005
00:45:29,255 --> 00:45:30,624
<i>Paris Review</i> be damned.

1006
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:33,874
Thank you.

1007
00:45:38,630 --> 00:45:40,499
I... I really have to go.

1008
00:45:45,297 --> 00:45:46,630
<i> Hey.</i>
<i>Why're you calling?</i>

1009
00:45:46,714 --> 00:45:50,588
JC. I cornered Beyoncé
and made her sing like one.

1010
00:45:50,672 --> 00:45:51,421
She confirmed my worst fear.

1011
00:45:51,505 --> 00:45:54,213
The call came
from inside the house.

1012
00:45:54,297 --> 00:45:56,786
Meet me at the balcony.

1013
00:45:57,714 --> 00:45:58,755
Sorry to interrupt.

1014
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:01,416
But I came across something
I thought you might like.

1015
00:46:02,172 --> 00:46:04,755
A photo from last year.

1016
00:46:04,839 --> 00:46:06,130
Look at that,
photos of the family reunion

1017
00:46:06,214 --> 00:46:09,088
my cousins invited me to.

1018
00:46:09,172 --> 00:46:10,213
My parents didn't speak
one word to me

1019
00:46:10,297 --> 00:46:13,755
and made a big show of leaving
shortly after I arrived.

1020
00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:15,458
Thanks for that memory.

1021
00:46:15,755 --> 00:46:16,796
Max, do you wanna dance?

1022
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:19,421
Well, I'm not usually
into masked men,

1023
00:46:19,505 --> 00:46:21,194
but I'll take my chances
with you.

1024
00:46:24,089 --> 00:46:25,921
Monet de Haan,
I knew how low you could go,

1025
00:46:26,005 --> 00:46:29,338
- but this is even further.
- I only stoop to conquer.

1026
00:46:29,422 --> 00:46:30,963
And I would've
if you hadn't interfered.

1027
00:46:31,047 --> 00:46:34,213
- Interfered? You sold us out.
- You sold yourself out

1028
00:46:34,297 --> 00:46:35,838
when you got mired
in your sister's shit.

1029
00:46:35,922 --> 00:46:39,630
Pippa and Bianca are
laser-focused on their futures.

1030
00:46:39,714 --> 00:46:41,755
They're willing to do
whatever it takes.

1031
00:46:41,839 --> 00:46:43,671
And they listen
to their advisers,

1032
00:46:43,755 --> 00:46:44,463
which now includes me.

1033
00:46:44,547 --> 00:46:47,296
They don't even go
to our school.

1034
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:49,755
The world is bigger
than Constance, Julien.

1035
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:52,338
- I thought you were my friend.
- I thought you were mine too.

1036
00:46:52,422 --> 00:46:55,255
Which is why I put in all
of these hours to make sure

1037
00:46:55,339 --> 00:46:56,755
that you are the best.

1038
00:46:56,839 --> 00:46:58,630
But when you abandoned all
of that

1039
00:46:58,714 --> 00:47:00,880
to waste your power
and your time

1040
00:47:00,964 --> 00:47:02,713
with that buffaloco
without even thinking

1041
00:47:02,797 --> 00:47:06,213
about how it would affect
other people,

1042
00:47:06,297 --> 00:47:11,130
I was done. After years
of doing your dirty work,

1043
00:47:11,214 --> 00:47:13,796
you can't just decide
that you're clean

1044
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:15,249
all of a sudden.

1045
00:47:15,714 --> 00:47:17,171
Luna may not care, but this...

1046
00:47:17,255 --> 00:47:19,041
I already have
an agent at LGA, so.

1047
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:22,921
But this is my future.

1048
00:47:23,005 --> 00:47:25,130
If you can't roll
with your clients

1049
00:47:25,214 --> 00:47:28,171
as they change and grow,
what future will be there?

1050
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:30,505
I don't wanna do things the way
that we've always done it.

1051
00:47:30,589 --> 00:47:31,713
I wanna be better.

1052
00:47:31,797 --> 00:47:33,916
Well, good luck on being better
without me.

1053
00:47:35,714 --> 00:47:38,458
Good luck to you too.
I wish you the best.

1054
00:47:40,505 --> 00:47:41,838
Where is Audrey?

1055
00:47:41,922 --> 00:47:45,541
She wanted to talk,
I shouldn't have ignored her.

1056
00:47:46,005 --> 00:47:47,499
Ms. Yuki?

1057
00:47:47,589 --> 00:47:49,546
Obie Bergmann.

1058
00:47:49,630 --> 00:47:51,338
We met last year
at my mother's cover shoot.

1059
00:47:51,422 --> 00:47:52,963
Of course.
Nice seeing you, Obie.

1060
00:47:53,047 --> 00:47:55,005
- Yeah. Nice to see you.
- You can call me Nelly.

1061
00:47:55,089 --> 00:47:55,796
Oh, all right.

1062
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:58,463
- You're...
- I am a... Well, I'm...

1063
00:47:58,547 --> 00:48:00,880
I'm a Soprano, yeah.

1064
00:48:00,964 --> 00:48:02,046
- You?
- Eva Chen.

1065
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:04,171
Uh, she's down there somewhere
in tights being me.

1066
00:48:04,255 --> 00:48:05,213
I thought it'd be fun.

1067
00:48:05,297 --> 00:48:07,880
Now, why do we have you
to thank for the tickets?

1068
00:48:07,964 --> 00:48:10,046
Uh, my mom is stuck in Hamburg,

1069
00:48:10,130 --> 00:48:11,380
and she was so fond
of the profile,

1070
00:48:11,464 --> 00:48:13,046
she just thought it'd be
a nice gesture.

1071
00:48:13,130 --> 00:48:15,338
I would love to introduce you to my
girlfriend. She's around here somewhere.

1072
00:48:15,422 --> 00:48:17,671
She's a huge fan of everything
you've done for the magazine.

1073
00:48:17,755 --> 00:48:19,921
- Oh, of course. Thank you.
- Yeah.

1074
00:48:20,005 --> 00:48:21,421
And one of my teachers
was even fired

1075
00:48:21,505 --> 00:48:23,213
for submitting to her.

1076
00:48:23,297 --> 00:48:24,005
- That was crazy.
- Yeah.

1077
00:48:24,089 --> 00:48:25,838
Well, that...
That is pretty crazy.

1078
00:48:25,922 --> 00:48:27,916
Uh, you know, I... I wonder...

1079
00:48:28,630 --> 00:48:30,666
has anyone ever thought
that maybe...

1080
00:48:31,505 --> 00:48:34,124
you could be Gossip Girl?

1081
00:48:34,589 --> 00:48:35,921
Me?

1082
00:48:36,005 --> 00:48:37,296
- Why?
- You're a student,

1083
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:38,829
just like Dan Humphrey was.

1084
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:42,921
Writer like him,
an outsider like him.

1085
00:48:43,005 --> 00:48:45,296
You can nail the voice, not to
mention the literary references.

1086
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:47,171
And...

1087
00:48:47,255 --> 00:48:49,421
Gossip Girl was resurrected
right when you arrived

1088
00:48:49,505 --> 00:48:51,416
- and not a moment sooner.
- I...

1089
00:48:52,339 --> 00:48:54,546
I don't understand.
You think I'm...

1090
00:48:54,630 --> 00:48:57,296
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to put you on the spot like that.

1091
00:48:57,380 --> 00:48:59,255
Um, you wouldn't want to go
get some fresh air real quick?

1092
00:48:59,339 --> 00:49:01,588
There's... there's actually
a killer 99-cent pizza place

1093
00:49:01,672 --> 00:49:03,838
- down the block. This is...
- Oh, Zoya, there you are.

1094
00:49:03,922 --> 00:49:06,421
I would like to
introduce you to my friend.

1095
00:49:06,505 --> 00:49:08,963
- Simon?
- Ms. Yuki.

1096
00:49:09,047 --> 00:49:10,088
- You know her?
- Of course he knows me.

1097
00:49:10,172 --> 00:49:12,499
I'm his boss.

1098
00:49:13,214 --> 00:49:14,583
Are you Chuck Bass?

1099
00:49:15,922 --> 00:49:17,005
Obie, what's this about?

1100
00:49:17,089 --> 00:49:18,630
Yes, can someone please tell me
what's going on right now?

1101
00:49:18,714 --> 00:49:22,546
Simon Rivera
is not a student anywhere.

1102
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:25,713
Simon Ravetch is a researcher
for<i> New York Magazine.</i>

1103
00:49:25,797 --> 00:49:27,874
Isn't that right, Mr. Ravetch?

1104
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:31,869
I'll get us our table cards.

1105
00:49:35,672 --> 00:49:38,666
- Victor.
- So, you called him after all?

1106
00:49:40,422 --> 00:49:41,796
I don't know
what you're talking about.

1107
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:43,296
The masked man
you were grinding on in there.

1108
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:46,333
That's Rafa Caparros.

1109
00:49:46,547 --> 00:49:48,380
No, it's not.

1110
00:49:48,464 --> 00:49:49,630
I would know
those freckles anywhere.

1111
00:49:49,714 --> 00:49:52,791
I used to trace them
with my tongue.

1112
00:49:53,964 --> 00:49:56,046
I told my boyfriend
that we didn't have a chance.

1113
00:49:56,130 --> 00:49:58,958
- He still likes them young.
- Still?

1114
00:49:59,422 --> 00:50:01,208
We fucked when I was a senior.

1115
00:50:01,714 --> 00:50:03,213
That's his thing.

1116
00:50:03,297 --> 00:50:06,499
I hope he'd grown out of that.
I... I guess not.

1117
00:50:07,255 --> 00:50:09,088
But has he taken you
to his parents' house

1118
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:10,541
in Patagonia?

1119
00:50:11,797 --> 00:50:15,208
So that's when you know
you're really in.

1120
00:50:17,922 --> 00:50:20,505
You've been impersonating
a student

1121
00:50:20,589 --> 00:50:21,880
because of Gossip Girl?

1122
00:50:21,964 --> 00:50:23,046
I was following a hunch
on who Gossip Girl could be,

1123
00:50:23,130 --> 00:50:26,838
all right? I began to think
that a Constance student...

1124
00:50:26,922 --> 00:50:30,505
this student was following
in Dan Humphrey's footsteps.

1125
00:50:30,589 --> 00:50:32,921
This is better than I thought.

1126
00:50:33,005 --> 00:50:34,671
- Obie, how did you even...
- Oh, well, my... my parents

1127
00:50:34,755 --> 00:50:35,546
leased Dumbo Hall,
the building it's in,

1128
00:50:35,630 --> 00:50:37,046
so we're founding members.

1129
00:50:37,130 --> 00:50:40,338
And the front desk told me
that Simon here was actually

1130
00:50:40,422 --> 00:50:42,505
a guest of Ben Peryer
from Condé Nast,

1131
00:50:42,589 --> 00:50:43,880
so I called him.

1132
00:50:43,964 --> 00:50:46,505
And he said that...
That Simon Ravetch

1133
00:50:46,589 --> 00:50:49,421
is actually a friend of a friend
who wanted to check the space out.

1134
00:50:49,505 --> 00:50:51,880
That he had his eye on
the front door the entire time

1135
00:50:51,964 --> 00:50:54,171
as if he were, and I quote,
"Looking for someone."

1136
00:50:54,255 --> 00:50:56,458
Me.

1137
00:50:58,089 --> 00:51:00,338
Ben told me about how you worked
at New York.

1138
00:51:00,422 --> 00:51:01,880
Linkedln said you were
a researcher, so.

1139
00:51:01,964 --> 00:51:05,541
- That's why you invited me here?
- Yeah.

1140
00:51:06,422 --> 00:51:07,921
No story is worth
one's reputation, Simon.

1141
00:51:08,005 --> 00:51:09,713
Maybe a couple months
transcribing podcasts

1142
00:51:09,797 --> 00:51:13,255
for SB Nation will remind you
of that.

1143
00:51:13,339 --> 00:51:16,796
This kind of drama is exactly
what Gossip Girl wants.

1144
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:19,213
If you stoop to her level,
Mr. Bergmann,

1145
00:51:19,297 --> 00:51:21,041
you're no better than her.

1146
00:51:22,130 --> 00:51:23,499
Simon, let's go.

1147
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:30,255
You knew and you didn't tell me.

1148
00:51:30,339 --> 00:51:32,916
You were excited to have
a new friend, but...

1149
00:51:34,339 --> 00:51:36,333
you gotta be careful, Z.
You have to be.

1150
00:51:38,130 --> 00:51:39,713
People like that,
they will take advantage

1151
00:51:39,797 --> 00:51:40,921
to get closer to people like us.

1152
00:51:41,005 --> 00:51:43,546
I'm not like you, Obie.
I'm outside your bubble.

1153
00:51:43,630 --> 00:51:45,380
Sometimes I feel like
you don't get that.

1154
00:51:45,464 --> 00:51:47,296
And other times, I worry
you get it too much.

1155
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:48,255
That I'm just charity,
another box for you

1156
00:51:48,339 --> 00:51:50,546
to check in
your performative solidarity.

1157
00:51:50,630 --> 00:51:52,749
No, you are my girlfriend,
and I don't...

1158
00:51:53,672 --> 00:51:55,338
I just wish that you would act
like that sometimes.

You know what, I know why.

Because she wanted attention

that loved her most.

1171

And I didn't give it to her.

to those changes.

Well, I only lied

- Of course, yeah.

1225
00:54:52,130 --> 00:54:54,019
- It's just down the hall.
- Hmm.

1226
00:55:00,255 --> 00:55:02,213
<i>You thought I went somewhere?</i>

1227
00:55:02,297 --> 00:55:05,588
<i>Well, I'm back.
And better than ever.</i>

1228
00:55:05,672 --> 00:55:07,380
<i>Yes, maybe I'd begun to wonder</i>

1229
00:55:07,464 --> 00:55:10,338
<i>if I was abusing
my considerable power,</i>

1230
00:55:10,422 --> 00:55:14,421
<i>when I realized you're the ones
who do that, not me.</i>

1231
00:55:14,505 --> 00:55:18,541
<i>I'm not your parent,
your teacher, or your friend.</i>

1232
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:19,963
<i>I'm your mirror.</i>

1233
00:55:20,047 --> 00:55:22,755
<i>I show you your bad parents,</i>

1234
00:55:22,839 --> 00:55:26,463
<i>your absent teachers,
your errant friends.</i>

1235
00:55:26,547 --> 00:55:28,588
<i>But if there's one thing
this moment of reflection</i>

1236
00:55:28,672 --> 00:55:33,963
<i>showed me, it's that this
isn't a place for you to speak.</i>

1237
00:55:34,047 --> 00:55:36,796
<i>I'm turning off the comments
from now on.</i>

1238
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:40,671
<i>Mine is the only voice
you need to listen to anyway,</i>

1239
00:55:40,755 --> 00:55:44,796
<i>because if you were kinder
to one another, more honest,</i>

1240
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:48,005
<i>if you had the hard
face-to-face conversations,</i>

1241
00:55:48,089 --> 00:55:52,171
<i>you wouldn't need me.
But you don't.</i>

1242
00:55:52,255 --> 00:55:56,505
<i>You bring a gun to school.
You sneak out on your boyfriend.</i>

1243
00:55:56,589 --> 00:55:58,796
<i>You hide behind your phones.</i>

1244
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:00,171
<i>So keep your masks on all year</i>

1245
00:56:00,255 --> 00:56:02,505
<i>if you want to.</i>

1246
00:56:02,589 --> 00:56:06,421
<i>But know I'll be here
keeping count,</i>

1247
00:56:06,505 --> 00:56:08,130
<i>keeping you in check,</i>

1248
00:56:08,214 --> 00:56:12,421
<i>reflecting what you refuse
to see is right in front of you.</i>

1249
00:56:12,505 --> 00:56:17,588
Hey, Nick, are... are you hungry?
Uh, I know a good diner nearby.

1250

Everything Gossip Girl's
ever posted, it's all gone.

1251
00:56:22,214 --> 00:56:23,046
What does that mean?

1252
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:26,958
- Clean slate.
- God, I hope so.

1253
00:56:28,797 --> 00:56:30,446
Ms. Hope.

1254
00:56:31,964 --> 00:56:33,624
Your mom's gonna be okay.

1255
00:56:34,005 --> 00:56:36,874
She's awake but groggy.

1256
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:42,796
- Thank you so much, Doctor.
- I should warn you though.

1257
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:45,958
It's gonna be a very long
and hard road to recovery.
