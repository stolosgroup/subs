155
00:06:22,112 --> 00:06:24,028
our mutual dalliances
with Max never happened,

156

it's irrevocably shifted

Really? Sleeping with one
of your mutual,

159

best friends did that?

160

Fair, but for me,
it isn't about Max.

Well, it is,
but not in that way.

I slept with someone
of the opposite sex,

163
00:06:38,696 --> 00:06:41,195
which is unacceptable
but not abnormal.

he's attracted to men, Julien!

...and never told you

because you use words
like "normal."

170

Fair again. But, like,
is he bi? Is he gay?

I mean, what if all this time
that we've been together,

he's been hiding
who he really is?

Hiding inside me?

174
00:07:06,154 --> 00:07:09,320
Just ask him. If he's gay,
or bi, whatever it is,

175
00:07:09,404 --> 00:07:11,278
he's probably scared
of how you'll react.
