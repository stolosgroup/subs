00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,499
Abhorrent?
A word I got wrong,

Yeah, it really held you back.

67
00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:03,291
That depends on if money
is your measure of success.

68
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:04,707
I didn't tell you
because I was embarrassed

69
00:03:04,791 --> 00:03:06,249
and I'm going to retake them.

70
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:08,038
Then maybe actually
prepare next time.

71
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:11,041
- Education gives you options.
- Options I have.

72
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:13,541
You mean Instagram?

73
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:15,541
What sort of retirement plan
do they offer?

74
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:17,874
A 401k in Etsy flower crowns?

75
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:19,082
I know her, actually.

76
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:21,207
She's a self-made
"in-fleur-encer."

77
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:23,624
And she made
the<i> Forbes</i> 40 under 30 list.

78
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:25,374
She'll be a billionaire

79
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:26,749
If there are still flowers,
that is.

80
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:29,624
You can joke all you want,
but this path that you're on,

81
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:31,541
it could vanish in a flash.

82
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:34,082
People move on from things
so quickly now.

83
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:36,582
Pandemics happen.
Priorities shift.

84
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:38,457
Schooling gives you something
to fall back on

85
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:39,416
when whatever this is fails.

86
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,541
- This is a business.
- It hasn't been so far.

87
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:45,332
It could be. I just haven't
sought out endorsements

88
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:48,041
because I haven't had to worry
about money, thanks to you.

89
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:50,541
But it's always been in my plan
to grow my brand.

90
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:52,666
And your brand is...?

91
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,416
Well, since
you're suddenly so curious,

92
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,082
why don't you let me show you
before you tell me to write it off?

93
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:59,308
If it means you retaking
the PSATs, you're on.

96
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,791
the "no phones

97
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:15,666
It's a real estate lawyer

98
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,975
We need some advice

99
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:20,433
Is their name also Kate Keller?

100
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:24,124
I can read your
grandma-sized font from here.

101
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:26,791
If you wanna be covert,
text with your glasses on.

102
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:28,957
Here, I'll give you some tips.

103
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:31,016
I'm good at drafting texts,
I just...

104
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:33,332
don't send them.

105
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:36,916
To your sister or Noble O?

106
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,945
You promised you'd stop
reading Gossip Girl.

107
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:39,957
I know things have been
a little weird

108
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:40,957
between Obie and me lately,

109
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:44,457
but when stuff happens
in his life,

110
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:46,082
shouldn't I, as his girlfriend,

111
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:49,624
- be his first call?
- Not necessarily.

112
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:51,332
You can't expect
to be everything to him.

113
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,308
That's not
a healthy relationship.

114
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:56,457
I don't wanna be everything.
I just... I wanna be something.

115
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:58,286
And right now,
that's not how it feels.

116
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:01,624
You wanna know what else
is unhealthy?

117
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:03,253
Keeping your feelings
to yourself.

118
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:07,832
Why don't you ask, uh,
the lawyer for what you want?

119
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:10,291
And I'll do the same.

120
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:12,291
I don't remember which one you
hate and which one I gave you.

121
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:14,041
You gave me that one,
and I hate both.

122
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:16,666
You should've just
grabbed a coat.

123
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:17,582
Max is bringing breakfast,

124
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:19,332
and then we're gonna take you
to school.

125
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:22,166
- No. I'm not going to school.
- You haven't been all week.

126
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,166
As long as she's here,
I'm here.

127
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:26,249
Her blood pressure is low,
she's dehydrated...

128
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:28,457
And she's in the care
of very fine doctors

129
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:29,166
who have it all under control.

130
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,624
- She's gonna be okay.
- Please.

131
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:34,666
The longer she's here,
the more at risk she is.

132
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,874
That resident with
the daily blowouts

133
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:38,916
didn't even realize that her
Tegaderm was loose yesterday,

134
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,957
but I did.

135
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:41,624
If it wasn't for me
micromanaging

136
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:43,124
her nepotistic lack of skills,
then she would...

137
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:47,291
But Dr. Death only makes rounds
at night, right?

138
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:49,207
Right. So Kiki will be fine

139
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:52,041
while you tackle your AP Lit
this afternoon.

140
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:53,457
- But I'm not going...
- Stop helicopter daughtering,

141
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:55,541
and eat.

142
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:57,457
Then put on
one of those hideous sweaters.

143
00:05:57,541 --> 00:05:59,600
That shirt is a biohazard
at this point.

144
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:05,207
She's so on edge.

145
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:06,541
I don't know
what else we can do.

146
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:07,416
I know.

147
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,791
Just keep trying to help
till she lets us?

148
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:14,600
You still doing that?

149
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,558
Hmm?

150
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:21,916
No, no, no.
I, uh, maxed that game out

151
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,350
and I'm not interested
in a replay.

152
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,505
You were right
about him, anyway.

153
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:31,249
Even in off-the-rack,
tens across the board.

154
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:32,707
Hey, that was from a nice store.

155
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:34,416
Can we please
just get this over with?

156
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,999
I spent all night
working on a new system.

157
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:40,874
Oh, there are props.

158
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:43,707
Hard copies, color-coded
and watermarked.

159
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:45,082
The first thing you'll see
is a schedule.

160
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:48,249
I've got posts weekdays
and nights.

161
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:51,041
And, uh, you have "Spotteds"
and weekends.

162
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:52,374
- What if I have plans?
- She knows you don't have plans.

163
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:55,166
You're in charge of combing
through our DMs

164
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,082
and anything we're tagged in.

165
00:06:57,166 --> 00:07:00,082
I've also been thinking of ways
to expand our playbook,

166
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:02,749
you know, like
with new recurring features.

167
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:06,499
The original GG had a sort of
teen Gawker Stalker map

168
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:09,624
called Spotted,
but I don't like those optics.

169
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:11,541
So, I'm thinking, uh,
themed posts,

170
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:15,291
like "W-T-Effed"
for fashion fails of the week.

171
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:18,832
"Blindspotted" when we wanna
focus on someone new.

172
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:19,999
Uh, what else? Let's see.

173
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:23,832
"Flashbackstory,"
where we go deep

174
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:26,457
on a relation of one
of our targets.

175
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:28,374
Holding not just these kids...

176
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:30,808
...accountable for
their actions, but also their...

177
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:34,499
Does she know
she stopped talking?

178
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:35,808
I do.

179
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:37,999
Nick Lott is inviting me
to stay for dinner

180
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,916
after my mentor session tonight.

181
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,666
Say yes. I mean, not only
is he cute and single,

182
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,999
but you can dig for all the dirt
on Zoya and Julien's dead mom

183
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:49,350
for your "Flashback" post.

184
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:54,558
"That sounds nice."

185
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:59,416
You said yes just to get dirt,
right? Not any other reason?

186
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,499
Of course.

187
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:02,975
I don't like him in that way.

188
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:06,416
Okay. On page two,
you'll see my ideas

189
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,249
for a new color story,
filters, and fonts...

190
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:10,832
<i> Love that,</i>

191
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:12,933
but try arching your back
a little more.

192
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:16,207
Yes. This harsh light
is perf for a pensive portrait,

193
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:18,541
but try to squint
like you're on a yacht

194
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:20,041
and you just took off
your shades,

195
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,041
not like gale-force winds
just blew mystery moist

196
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:23,624
into your eyes on Canal.

197
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:24,666
I'm sorry, Lu.

198
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,541
I just keep stressing out
about what my dad said.

199
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:29,249
And you're about to be
Chanel-show-crashed

200
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:30,850
- like Gigi Hadid.
- I just...

201
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:32,582
I shouldn't have left.

202
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:34,207
I don't... I don't trust
these hospital goons

203
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:36,457
to call me if something
goes downhill. I...

204
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:38,791
- I'm so stressed out about this.
- You are the first person

205
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:40,749
they'll call in an emergency,
I promise.

206
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:41,374
You needed a break.

207
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:44,058
Sit. Have an avocado puff.

208
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:45,874
Breathe.

209
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:48,207
You wanna impress your dad?
Then stay dedicated.

210
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:50,041
A dozen stories
and a slideshow per day.

211
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:51,707
Okay, I'm just gonna check in
one more time, okay?

212
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:53,541
- Okay. I'm here if you need me.
- Thanks.

213
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:54,850
Come on.

214
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:59,374
I'll do the story, I promise.
I just... I need to talk first.

215
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:02,082
About Audrey?
Girl needs to set an intention

216
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,249
with some crystals, stat.

217
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:06,832
About how we take all this
to the next level.

218
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:07,916
I wanna show my dad
that I'm serious.

219
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,082
That my brand can be a real
and lucrative career.

220
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:13,249
Do you know how long
I've waited for this?

221
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:16,041
For you to go from content
to creator,

222
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:18,249
icon to iconoclast?

223
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:19,332
I don't know about that, but...

224
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:21,707
The trends you create,
they're now,

225
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:22,749
but if you want
a lifelong career,

226
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:25,374
we need to remove you
from the concept of time.

227
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:26,582
Forget influence,
you need importance,

228
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:30,207
which takes more than
daily displays of good taste.

229
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:32,291
A great Rihanna banger
is of its moment.

230
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:34,016
Fenty is forever.

231
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:37,957
So I need to launch
my own line?

232
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:40,624
Oh, God, no. You're barely ready
to launch a zine.

233
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:43,957
Ultimately, yes, but first,
you need to test the waters.

234
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:45,624
Prove the depths
you can swim in.

235
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:49,499
Which means a collab.
I'll make some calls.

236
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:51,683
- Keep tonight open.
- Okay.

237
00:09:58,208 --> 00:10:00,141
Is one of those for me?

238
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:03,499
Finally caught you.

239
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:06,291
If you want me to chase again,
just let me know.

240
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:08,166
Is that the line you use
on all the boys?

241
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,124
So that's what this is about?

242
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:11,124
The fact that
I occasionally sleep

243
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:13,457
with a senior or two?

244
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:14,707
All this coming
from a 17-year-old

245
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:19,124
for whom ringside at the Knicks
takes on a whole other meaning?

246
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:21,791
- That's not the same.
- You're right.

247
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:23,308
You're different than them.

248
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:26,374
You aren't a conquest.

249
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:27,332
You're a fellow conquistador.

250
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:31,082
Consider me colonized
and move on.

251
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:32,666
I'm not gonna fuck you again.

252
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,832
And if I see you cozy up
to another student,

253
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:36,621
I'll make sure
that they don't either.

254
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:40,791
Yes, and please make sure
to give my mother her drip

255
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:43,624
before flirting with the EMT
that looks like Oscar Isaac.

256
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:45,749
She stands no chance.
Do not put me on hold. I...

257
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:47,832
I swear to God, if you put me
on hold right now...

258
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:50,225
Hello? Hell...

259
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:52,707
What? Can I help you?

260
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:55,832
I just wanted to say I hope
your mom's feeling better.

261
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:59,291
- And if you need anything...
- It won't be from you. So...

262
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:01,332
Look, I can't imagine
how you must feel right now,

263
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:03,749
but, um, sometimes, when
you're feeling overwhelmed,

264
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:05,957
it helps to take a deep breath
and imagine you're...

265
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:07,082
Watching your supposed boyfriend
have better chemistry

266
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,207
with your sister?

267
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:10,207
That calms me down every time.

268
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:11,541
Hmm. It's working for me too.

269
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:14,207
<i> Hello?</i>
<i>Are you still there?</i>

270
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:16,041
Yes, I am still here.

271
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:17,874
So maybe it's...

272
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:19,957
the kick in the ass
that I needed to start thinking

273
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:22,707
about the bigger picture
and not just how I look in it.

274
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:23,624
I want to invest in my future.

275
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:27,332
Did you just say "invest"
and "in future"?

276
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:28,749
When we were dating,
I couldn't even get you

277
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:30,249
to decide on a restaurant,
like, an hour in advance.

278
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:31,808
I'm growing.

279
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:34,933
I've noticed.

280
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:37,957
So I can do
what I've always done

281
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:40,207
and just live
and expect people to care,

282
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:43,916
or I can push myself
outside of my comfort zone

283
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,416
and figure out if there's a way
that I can use my platform

284
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,541
to create something
that people actually need.

285
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,130
I can't believe
what I'm hearing.

286
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,582
- Hey, there you are.
- Here I am. What'd I miss?

287
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:57,374
Oh, just new Julien's
genius master plan.

288
00:11:57,458 --> 00:11:59,582
Genius? Big word for 8:00 a.m.

289
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:02,582
It's not. He's just trying
to make me feel better.

290
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:04,416
I'm sure whatever it is,
it's amazing,

291
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,874
and I can't wait to hear
all about it, but, um,

292
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:08,582
first, when do I get
to meet your mom?

293
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:11,416
- Helena's in town?
- Yeah, uh, she is, yeah.

294
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,791
She just got in this morning.

295
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:14,624
Yeah. Gossip Girl
was all over it.

296
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:17,207
I don't know.
She didn't even, like,

297
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:19,582
tell me that she was coming.
She's just...

298
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:22,249
I don't know. She's here to check up
on the development in the Navy Yard,

299
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:23,041
and then she's gonna
have dinner with Aki's dad,

300
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:25,166
and then she's out.

301
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,749
So I don't even think
I'm gonna see her, really.

302
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:30,291
Well, do you wanna come over
after my mentor session

303
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:32,082
with, uh, Ms. Keller?

304
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:33,374
That way, I don't have to watch

305
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:35,582
my dad's pathetic
flirting attempts alone?

306
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:37,541
Uh, I would, yeah, but it's...
It's ball tryouts today,

307
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:38,499
so I'm probably just gonna have
to go home after

308
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:41,582

Yeah. Of course.

He's her golden boy,

he's totally terrified of her.

I had to track her down

00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:26,207
Uh, Obie invited me
to go to a fancy dinner

465
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:27,891
to meet his mom.

466
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,999
Can I go?

467
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:32,516
Kate and I already covered
a lot of ground.

468
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:36,207
Yes, you can.

469
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:38,249
But only if I can get
a picture with you first.

470
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:38,666
Ugh, Dad.

471
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:39,624
- Please?
- No.

472
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:41,975
- Just one.
- Uh-uh.

473
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:46,100
So...

474
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:47,891
how's tonight?

475
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:53,999
Sorry. They had us scrimmage.

476
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:55,874
- Oh, it's all good.
- Excuse me, nurse.

477
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:57,624
You're just in time
for this evening's show.

478
00:19:57,708 --> 00:20:00,041
Do you know the temperature
in my mother's room right now?

479
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:02,082
It is 67 degrees.

480
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:03,791
That might be
the proper temperature

481
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:06,332
for bedrooms according to
the National Sleep Foundation,

482
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:08,082
but for the hospital room
of a woman

483
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:11,166
with a weakened immune system,
it's downright deplorable.

484
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:13,374
How are you gonna fix it?
Go. Turn it up.

485
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:15,832
Go turn it up. Oh, my God.

486
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:17,416
That's the third nurse
of the night.

487
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,624
Oh, and you...

488
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:20,874
We were supposed to
have dinner tonight with my dad.

489
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:22,541
- Maybe we should cancel.
- Yeah.

490
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:27,082
Whoa.

491
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:29,475
I appear to be out of the loop
on something.

492
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:32,832
You still have Gossip Girl
on mute, don't you?

493
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:35,749
<i>Spotted. A
lone Wolfe dropping by a hospital</i>

494
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:37,999
<i>to pick up more
than Hope's spirits.</i>

495
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:39,082
<i>Take a seat, PSATs.</i>

496
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:42,374
<i>The test students should be
most worried about</i>

497
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:46,124
<i>is one you can't study for.
HMO, PPO, EPO?</i>

498
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:49,082
<i>If you've cozied up
to Max Wolfe lately,</i>

499
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:51,249
<i>I hope you have all your docs
on speed dial.</i>

500
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,332
Is this real?

501
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:55,166
Rafa's revenge. I expected more.

502
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:58,291
You can expect a lot less
until you clear this up.

503
00:20:58,375 --> 00:21:01,725
Hooking up is the last thing
on my mind right now.

504
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:03,291
But I'd better handle it

505
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:05,124
before I have to
present my medical records

506
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:07,124
to half of Kings County,
which means...

507
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:10,166
- This is red dye number five!
- I have to leave her here alone, or miss dinner.

508
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:12,291
Did you say you're taking
Ms. Hope to dinner?

509
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:13,874
Uh, yeah. I mean, I would,

510
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:15,457
but I don't think I'm gonna
get her to leave.

511
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:17,499
You have to.
We're getting complaints,

512
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:19,957
and not just the staff,
patients too.

513
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:22,332
She can come back tomorrow
during visiting hours.

514
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:26,624
...and you want her to be
assailed by the sight of lilies?

515
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:27,832
What are you, sadists?

516
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:32,641
Yeah. I'll take her.

517
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:40,207
So, this isn't awkward at all?
Me having invited myself?

518
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:42,332
No. No. I... I'm the one
who should feel awkward.

519
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:44,041
- I just didn't know how to, uh...
- Hey. Whatever happened,

520
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:45,666
it worked out
for the both of us.

521
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:49,225
- I'm happy to be here.
- Yeah, and I'm happy that you're here.

522
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:53,457
Uh, I already have a phone.

523
00:21:53,541 --> 00:21:55,475
- Thank you.
- No, uh, Aki's dad makes us.

524
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:00,207
He can wiretap anyone,
but no one can wiretap him?

525
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:02,641
Right this way,
Mr. Bergmann, Ms. Lott.

526
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:08,249
It's empty.

527
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:10,291
Yeah, Roger buys out
wherever he eats

528
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:11,624
and brings his own staff.

529
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:12,666
Is he afraid somebody's
gonna poison him

530
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:15,766
for all the things he's done?

531
00:22:18,833 --> 00:22:20,058
Mama.

532
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,308
Yeah.

533
00:22:23,583 --> 00:22:25,041
Zoya Jane Lott.

534
00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:26,916
Well, I've heard a lot
about you.

535
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,749
Hey, Otto, dear boy. You grew?

536
00:22:29,833 --> 00:22:31,707
I did indeed. Yes, sir.

537
00:22:31,791 --> 00:22:34,374
Zoya, glad to get to know you
in a proper location.

538
00:22:34,458 --> 00:22:36,457
She means it in a nice way.

539
00:22:36,541 --> 00:22:37,291
I'm Jody, Aki's mom.

540
00:22:37,375 --> 00:22:39,499
- What's going on?
- Mom?

541
00:22:39,583 --> 00:22:41,416
I thought you said
they knew I was coming?

542
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,499
This table is for six,
and there's seven of us.

543
00:22:43,583 --> 00:22:45,791
- I'm just gonna...
- Babe, it's fine.

544
00:22:45,875 --> 00:22:47,249
I didn't know Zoya was coming.

545
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:49,475
Hey, I didn't either
until about an hour ago.

546
00:22:51,625 --> 00:22:54,082
Hmm. Did you go
to the opera first, or...

547
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:55,166
In Europe, we dress for dinner.

548
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:57,999
It's a shame
that never caught on here.

549
00:22:58,083 --> 00:22:59,749
Kiki is still
in the hospital, Mama,

550
00:22:59,833 --> 00:23:01,499
so Audrey's come from there.

551
00:23:01,583 --> 00:23:04,041
I was sorry to hear
what happened.

552
00:23:04,125 --> 00:23:07,291
I had no idea that your mother
was struggling so.

553
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:10,499
Even though your papers reported
in great detail

554
00:23:10,583 --> 00:23:13,624
about the failure
of her company almost daily?

555
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:16,332
I may own the papers,
but I don't believe in

556
00:23:16,416 --> 00:23:19,832
preventing journalists
from doing their jobs.

557
00:23:19,916 --> 00:23:24,374
However, I'm personally sorry
that it all went so public.

558
00:23:24,458 --> 00:23:25,683
- Me too.
- Hmm.

559
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:29,332
Well, you needn't have worried,
Ms. Lott.

560
00:23:29,416 --> 00:23:30,624
I know you're new here,

561
00:23:30,708 --> 00:23:32,249
but you'll soon see
that we're all very close.

562
00:23:32,333 --> 00:23:35,291
I mean, Helena and I
have known each other

563
00:23:35,375 --> 00:23:37,457
since before our sons were born.

564
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,416
Jody and I were married
for a decade.

565
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:43,249
So none of us have got
any secrets here.

566
00:23:43,333 --> 00:23:45,475
The settlement
made sure of that.

567
00:23:46,083 --> 00:23:47,975
Plus all the wiretapping?

568
00:23:51,625 --> 00:23:54,374
We ask you post
at least two tutorials a day

569
00:23:54,458 --> 00:23:56,374
at specific times
based on our analytics,

570
00:23:56,458 --> 00:23:57,416
which we would shoot in advance,

571
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:00,124
as we're respectful
of your school schedule.

572
00:24:00,208 --> 00:24:01,957
My brand
is all about authenticity.

573
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:02,957
I don't do pre-shoots.

574
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:05,791
I upload the moment we post.

575
00:24:05,875 --> 00:24:07,374
An honest and free spirit
like yourself

576
00:24:07,458 --> 00:24:10,916
might benefit more
from our company's philosophy.

577
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,957
We're all about what's natural.

578
00:24:13,041 --> 00:24:15,457
We do some light retouching,
teeth whitening, flyaways,

579
00:24:15,541 --> 00:24:19,541
nothing you wouldn't want.
What are your priorities?

580
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:22,124
Well, a big one is
I want to partner with a brand

581
00:24:22,208 --> 00:24:25,582
that caters to women of color
as much as it does white women.

582
00:24:25,666 --> 00:24:28,124
- Well, that's why...
- You'd serve your audience best

583
00:24:28,208 --> 00:24:29,832
with a more established brand.

584
00:24:29,916 --> 00:24:31,082
One that already
has a proven track record

585
00:24:31,166 --> 00:24:34,124
in that department.
Like Revlon.

586
00:24:34,208 --> 00:24:36,166
You'd have to be seen using
only our products,

587
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:38,082
the best in the industry,
so no loss there.

588
00:24:38,166 --> 00:24:39,416
And you're still new.

589
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,499
Someone like us could take you
to the next level.

590
00:24:41,583 --> 00:24:44,332
Our top influencer
has 34 million followers.

591
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:46,291
If you let Ulta
shake up your image,

592
00:24:46,375 --> 00:24:48,933
we can remake you into
something actually profitable.

593
00:24:49,791 --> 00:24:51,141
Some thing?

594
00:24:54,083 --> 00:24:55,582
You haven't met
until recently?

595
00:24:55,666 --> 00:24:57,999
Oh, no, our dads don't speak.
Or didn't.

596
00:24:58,083 --> 00:25:00,166
- And you were raised...?
- She's from Buffalo.

597
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:03,582
Hmm. I've never been.
What's it like?

598
00:25:03,666 --> 00:25:05,707
Yes. Please regale us
with the history

599
00:25:05,791 --> 00:25:07,791
of its chief export,
chicken wings.

600
00:25:07,875 --> 00:25:11,624
Actually, Buffalo is a pretty
interesting place, historically.

601
00:25:11,708 --> 00:25:14,541
Home of Grover Cleveland,
Mark Twain,

602
00:25:14,625 --> 00:25:16,791
and F. Scott Fitzgerald.

603
00:25:16,875 --> 00:25:18,874
Yes. They host readings
at his childhood home

604
00:25:18,958 --> 00:25:20,874
every year on his birthday.
I've never missed one.

605
00:25:20,958 --> 00:25:21,957
But if you want to talk
Buffalo pride,

606
00:25:22,041 --> 00:25:24,749
the town really came together
during the BLM protests.

607
00:25:24,833 --> 00:25:27,207
- It was...
- You know, I owned the Bills for one season.

608
00:25:27,291 --> 00:25:30,332
It was the worst investment
I ever had.

609
00:25:30,416 --> 00:25:33,624
Still, it got you and Otto
to make much-needed renovations

610
00:25:33,708 --> 00:25:34,707
at that stadium.

611
00:25:34,791 --> 00:25:36,457
We've done so much
business together.

612
00:25:36,541 --> 00:25:37,791
Who can remember it all?

613
00:25:37,875 --> 00:25:39,916
My dad and I used to go
to that stadium all the...

614
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,999
Tell me, how did
Jakarta Tower hold up

615
00:25:42,083 --> 00:25:42,707
after the last earthquake?

616
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:44,541
Solid as a rock.

617
00:25:44,625 --> 00:25:47,499
I never thought we'd ever get
that damn thing finished

618
00:25:47,583 --> 00:25:49,374
with Hamish and Jake and Eliza

619
00:25:49,458 --> 00:25:51,957
at each other's throats
the whole time.

620
00:25:52,041 --> 00:25:54,166
My half-siblings. Much older.

621
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:56,457
- From his early wives.
- I know who they are.

622
00:25:56,541 --> 00:25:59,332
I read about them,
and you, a lot.

623
00:25:59,416 --> 00:26:01,207
And it's all true.

624
00:26:01,291 --> 00:26:03,082
You know, they didn't really
give one whit about me.

625
00:26:03,166 --> 00:26:05,166
All they care about is, uh,

626
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:07,808
who I'll put in charge
when I die.

627
00:26:09,333 --> 00:26:11,916
Oh, except for my boy here.

628
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,582
This boy, he calls me
on my birthday.

629
00:26:14,666 --> 00:26:16,582
He texts just to say hello.

630
00:26:16,666 --> 00:26:20,874
I never have to worry about
poison in my sherry

631
00:26:20,958 --> 00:26:23,082
- with him around.
- An occupational hazard

632
00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:25,957
when you run
a right-wing propaganda machine

633
00:26:26,041 --> 00:26:29,058
bent on destabilizing
global democracy, am I right?

634
00:26:32,708 --> 00:26:36,082
- Well said.
- I like a girl with an opinion.

635
00:26:36,166 --> 00:26:39,082
You say opinion, but this girl
says kind of factual.

636
00:26:39,166 --> 00:26:41,291
What other opinions
do you have, girl?

637
00:26:41,375 --> 00:26:43,957
Have you given more thought
about relocating the NetCorp

638
00:26:44,041 --> 00:26:45,457
to the Navy Yard?

639
00:26:45,541 --> 00:26:46,916
Come have a tour
while you're here.

640
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,249
There have been protests
at that development all week.

641
00:26:49,333 --> 00:26:50,499
- Zoya...
- Really?

642
00:26:50,583 --> 00:26:52,124
Have there been? Do tell.

643
00:26:52,208 --> 00:26:53,499
- Audrey...
- Zoya's right.

644
00:26:53,583 --> 00:26:56,558
The city has limited land.
Everyone wants a piece.

645
00:26:57,291 --> 00:26:58,916
It's bound to make
some people unhappy.

646
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,291
Unhappy? You're demolishing
a homeless shelter

647
00:27:00,375 --> 00:27:02,624
and increasing
the homeless population,

648
00:27:02,708 --> 00:27:05,124
for what?
Condos with poor doors?

649
00:27:05,208 --> 00:27:06,457
Obie knows more about this
than I do.

650
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:08,016
He protests all the time.

651
00:27:08,583 --> 00:27:09,808
Obie?

652
00:27:10,583 --> 00:27:12,166
The city condemned the shelter.

653
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:13,666
It was always going
to be destroyed.

654
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:15,535
Yeah, sure.
But why not build a new one?

655
00:27:17,333 --> 00:27:20,499
It's nearly 11:00 in Sapporo.

656
00:27:20,583 --> 00:27:22,968
If I don't call your father now,
I'll lose him all day.

657
00:27:23,541 --> 00:27:26,499
Please.

658
00:27:26,583 --> 00:27:28,124
I guess the hospital
hasn't called,

659
00:27:28,208 --> 00:27:29,874
but I'm just gonna check in
really quick, okay?

660
00:27:29,958 --> 00:27:31,249
Yeah.

661
00:27:31,333 --> 00:27:33,291
You told me
about those protests.

662
00:27:33,375 --> 00:27:34,791
You said what she's doing
is wrong.

663
00:27:34,875 --> 00:27:37,166
It is wrong, Zoya,
but we're at dinner.

664
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:39,999
So when is it gonna be an appropriate
time to tell her what you really think?

665
00:27:40,083 --> 00:27:42,683
Dessert? Or never?

666
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:46,475
What the fuck?

667
00:27:49,041 --> 00:27:50,749
Yeah. You might wanna
get that checked out.

668
00:27:50,833 --> 00:27:52,082
Oh, you mean fact-checked?

669
00:27:52,166 --> 00:27:54,124
Tell Gossip Girl
that this is a lie.

670
00:27:54,208 --> 00:27:56,791
Um... nah.

671
00:27:56,875 --> 00:27:58,916
You know that
this is harassment, right?

672
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,832
Oh, you mean like stalking me
at a bathhouse?

673
00:28:01,916 --> 00:28:03,957
Following me into the showers
at school?

674
00:28:04,041 --> 00:28:05,457
Showing up
at my house unannounced?

675
00:28:05,541 --> 00:28:07,332
I mean,
who's the victim here, really?

676
00:28:07,416 --> 00:28:11,374
Just stop lying,
or I will destroy you.

677
00:28:11,458 --> 00:28:13,041
Why wait when you can make good
on that promise now?

678
00:28:13,125 --> 00:28:15,707
Get the fuck off of me.

679
00:28:15,791 --> 00:28:18,541
What is with this sudden bout
of morality?

680
00:28:18,625 --> 00:28:21,082
You wanted this.
You made it happen.

681
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:23,016
I'm just playing along.

682
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,475
You know what? I don't care.

683
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:32,749
Let everyone think
that I have an STI.

684
00:28:32,833 --> 00:28:37,225
I would rather fuck no one
than fuck you again.

685
00:28:41,291 --> 00:28:45,808
♪

686
00:28:49,541 --> 00:28:51,891
Okay, you've asked me enough.
Now it's my turn.

687
00:28:53,208 --> 00:28:55,207
Teacher at 24.

688
00:28:55,291 --> 00:28:56,791
How does that even happen?

689
00:28:56,875 --> 00:28:59,082
All my teachers
were grandparents.

690
00:28:59,166 --> 00:29:01,475
Yeah, well, a lot's changed
since, um...

691
00:29:02,041 --> 00:29:04,291
Oh, God.
That's not what I meant.

692
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:05,916
It's true.

693
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,291
Um... No, but you're a writer.
Not just a teacher.

694
00:29:08,375 --> 00:29:11,166
That's what you wanna do, right?

695
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:12,499
I mainly wanted to be famous.

696
00:29:12,583 --> 00:29:16,725
- Like Cormac McCarthy?
- Like anyone.

697
00:29:18,708 --> 00:29:22,225
Oh, God. I don't think
I've ever said this out loud.

698
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,641
When I was younger,
I had this thing...

699
00:29:27,375 --> 00:29:31,041
where I just wanted
to be the best.

700
00:29:31,125 --> 00:29:35,332
At anything. I was terrified
of being ordinary.

701
00:29:35,416 --> 00:29:40,249
Maybe a Best Actress,
Best Album, a gold in swimming.

702
00:29:40,333 --> 00:29:42,249
No matter what I tried,
though...

703
00:29:42,333 --> 00:29:44,666
Uh, acting? I had eight lines

704
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:46,457
in the high school
<i>Sound of Music,</i>

705
00:29:46,541 --> 00:29:48,416
and I forgot six.

706
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,832
Singing? I can surprise you
at karaoke,

707
00:29:50,916 --> 00:29:52,916
but you're not gonna follow me
on Spotify.

708
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,124
But with writing,

709
00:29:54,208 --> 00:29:57,166
I'd found it.

710
00:29:57,250 --> 00:30:00,124
The thing that
I was the best at.

711
00:30:00,208 --> 00:30:01,416
I had a point of view, a voice.

712
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:04,332
People actually wanted
to read me.

713
00:30:04,416 --> 00:30:07,332
I was published
in the school journal at 15.

714
00:30:07,416 --> 00:30:09,541
Column at Barnard. Iowa at 22.

715
00:30:09,625 --> 00:30:14,891
It was all working.
And then I met her.

716
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,291
Who?

717
00:30:17,375 --> 00:30:20,249
An actress acquaintance
of mine once said

718
00:30:20,333 --> 00:30:21,975
that every actor
has their Meryl.

719
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:26,666
Someone who,
no matter what you do,

720
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:30,457
you will never be seen
the way they're seen.

721
00:30:30,541 --> 00:30:33,457
You could give
the same performance,

722
00:30:33,541 --> 00:30:35,707
you could give one better,
doesn't matter,

723
00:30:35,791 --> 00:30:37,516
because you're not her.

724
00:30:37,916 --> 00:30:39,416
My Meryl had that thing.

725
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:43,082
She was part magnet,
part mirror.

726
00:30:43,166 --> 00:30:46,416
You'd feel both, like,
drawn to her

727
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:49,016
and exposed by her
at the same time.

728
00:30:49,583 --> 00:30:50,707
We would have to...

729
00:30:50,791 --> 00:30:54,416
write a thousand words
on our first time.

730
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:58,124
Mine was honest, brutal, brave.

731
00:30:58,208 --> 00:30:59,933
Hers, banal.

732
00:31:01,291 --> 00:31:02,207
It didn't matter.

733
00:31:02,291 --> 00:31:07,683
People clapped after mine.
They cried reading hers.

734
00:31:08,666 --> 00:31:11,707
She had it. And...

735
00:31:11,791 --> 00:31:14,916
it wasn't until meeting her
that I realized I didn't.

736
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,249
Sounds like what she had
was a sense of entitlement.

737
00:31:19,333 --> 00:31:21,041
No, that was me.

738
00:31:21,125 --> 00:31:24,266
I... I thought
I deserved success.

739
00:31:25,291 --> 00:31:26,516
I...

740
00:31:27,208 --> 00:31:29,600
thought I could be the best.

741
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:34,766
I guess some people just...

742
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,725
go by unnoticed.

743
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:39,874
You still write?

744
00:31:39,958 --> 00:31:42,975
Yes. But the difference is
that now I know I'm not Meryl.

745
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,791
I write for myself.

746
00:31:46,875 --> 00:31:51,916
No expectation
or hope of validation.

747
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,957
And in a small way,
I think that

748
00:31:55,041 --> 00:31:58,249
who I am now
might do more for the world

749
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:01,058
than I ever could have
being famous.

750
00:32:02,166 --> 00:32:03,433
You mean as a teacher?

751
00:32:03,833 --> 00:32:05,957
Mm-hmm.

752
00:32:06,708 --> 00:32:09,166
Not what you were expecting.

753
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:12,124
- It's just a lot to think about.
- It shouldn't be.

754
00:32:12,208 --> 00:32:15,457
Julien will get back to everyone
once she's reviewed her options.

755
00:32:15,541 --> 00:32:16,749
Well, first and foremost,

756
00:32:16,833 --> 00:32:18,791
Sephora listens
to our partners' voices.

757
00:32:18,875 --> 00:32:21,957
And we're the only company here
that prioritizes

758
00:32:22,041 --> 00:32:23,416
Black-owned beauty brands.

759
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:26,207
We value inclusion
and individuality.

760
00:32:26,291 --> 00:32:28,291
And, in fact,
we're always looking for ways

761
00:32:28,375 --> 00:32:29,457
to educate ourselves
and improve.

762
00:32:29,541 --> 00:32:32,707
We're not just about makeup.
We wanna make a difference.

763
00:32:32,791 --> 00:32:34,957
We'd be happy to sign
a nonexclusive two-year deal

764
00:32:35,041 --> 00:32:39,207
where you, and only you, choose
what to put out into the world.

765
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:43,041
If interested, let us know
in the next 24 hours.

766
00:32:43,125 --> 00:32:45,374
You'd be the youngest influencer
we've ever contracted with.

767
00:32:51,291 --> 00:32:53,124
- I'll see where your cars are.
- Yeah.

768
00:32:53,208 --> 00:32:55,124
Ten texts from Julien
asking how I am,

769
00:32:55,208 --> 00:32:57,624
- but nothing from the hospital.
- I'm sure everything's okay.

770
00:32:57,708 --> 00:32:58,457
Gonna call
the nurses' station again.

771
00:32:58,541 --> 00:33:01,832
Oh, God! What?

772
00:33:01,916 --> 00:33:04,516
- What is it?
- Hmm? Nothing.

773
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:07,916
Just, uh, a lawsuit
that won't go away.

774
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,832
He'll settle.

775
00:33:09,916 --> 00:33:12,291
Ah, not sure
about this one.

776
00:33:12,375 --> 00:33:14,707
- The press are all over it.
- What is it?

777
00:33:14,791 --> 00:33:15,457
It's none of our business, Zoya.

778
00:33:15,541 --> 00:33:18,332
It's an in-house dispute.

779
00:33:18,416 --> 00:33:22,624
A few years ago,
one of my CCOs asked an employee

780
00:33:22,708 --> 00:33:25,874
to stop discussing
his marital problems

781
00:33:25,958 --> 00:33:27,916
- in the office.
- That's a lawsuit?

782
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,416
Well, it is when the spouse
is a man.

783
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,749
He gets divorced.

784
00:33:31,833 --> 00:33:34,916
We get accused of showing
preferential treatment

785
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,541
to heterosexual staffers,

786
00:33:37,625 --> 00:33:40,541
in a lawsuit that has
the temerity to suggest

787
00:33:40,625 --> 00:33:41,874
that NetCorp cultivates

788
00:33:41,958 --> 00:33:46,541
a pervasive
anti-gay workplace environment.

789
00:33:46,625 --> 00:33:48,874
- Well, do you?
- Zoya, stop.

790
00:33:48,958 --> 00:33:51,166
We made a company-wide request
that any conversation

791
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:57,124
regarding personal relationships
should stay outside the office.

792
00:33:57,208 --> 00:33:58,916
And if it wasn't discrimination,
why did it take

793
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,291
a gay colleague's actions
to implement the policy?

794
00:34:01,375 --> 00:34:04,082
Oh, you really are
a lawyer's daughter, aren't you?

795
00:34:04,166 --> 00:34:05,291
- Hello?
- Look...

796
00:34:05,375 --> 00:34:07,666
- Do not put me on hold.
- I'm not homophobic.

797
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:09,499
Neither is my company.

798
00:34:09,583 --> 00:34:12,124
We're one of the first
to give partners healthcare,

799
00:34:12,208 --> 00:34:15,749
to grant paternity leave.
We treat them equally.

800
00:34:15,833 --> 00:34:17,332
Not if you use the term "them."

801
00:34:17,416 --> 00:34:18,791
Well, what am I supposed
to call them now?

802
00:34:18,875 --> 00:34:21,600
- I'll just meet you outside.
- Okay.

803
00:34:22,875 --> 00:34:24,249
Oh, what did I say now?

804
00:34:24,333 --> 00:34:27,041
You know, you can be a little
bit more sensitive, okay?

805
00:34:27,125 --> 00:34:30,641
You never know how someone
at the table identifies.

806
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:37,749
Oh. Uh, so, you're, um...

807
00:34:37,833 --> 00:34:40,166
I'm not,
but what does that matter?

808
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:42,749
No. No. Zoya's, uh...
Zoya's my girlfriend.

809
00:34:42,833 --> 00:34:44,725
Are you saying Akeno?

810
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:49,082
Hello? Oh, hi.
Yeah, she's good? Great.

811
00:34:49,166 --> 00:34:52,683
Um... Sorry, I have to go. Um...
Yep. Mm-hmm. She's great? Great.

812
00:34:55,375 --> 00:34:58,624
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

813
00:35:04,708 --> 00:35:07,874
- What... what was that?
- I just...

814
00:35:07,958 --> 00:35:10,457
I just outed my boyfriend
to his parents.

815
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:11,624
I cannot believe
what I just did.

816
00:35:11,708 --> 00:35:13,457
- I'm a horrible person.
- Wait. Aki's...

817
00:35:13,541 --> 00:35:14,957
It's 2021, Zoya.

818
00:35:15,041 --> 00:35:16,916
He doesn't have to label it.
But yes, he's queer, he's bi.

819
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,865
I don't know.
He hasn't decided yet, okay?

820
00:35:19,041 --> 00:35:21,207
Shit.

821
00:35:21,291 --> 00:35:25,207
You know what? No, it's fine.
This is not my fault. It's not.

822
00:35:25,291 --> 00:35:27,374
He wanted me to come tonight.
I didn't wanna come tonight.

823
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:29,124
I wanted to stay
at the hospital. I...

824
00:35:29,208 --> 00:35:30,499
- I shouldn't...
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

825
00:35:30,583 --> 00:35:31,582
You're just...
You're just exhausted, okay?

826
00:35:31,666 --> 00:35:34,707
You're dealing with something
very heavy right now.

827
00:35:34,791 --> 00:35:36,749
- He'll understand.
- Okay, so...

828
00:35:36,833 --> 00:35:39,832
So... so what do... what do I do?

829
00:35:39,916 --> 00:35:41,791
How do I... How do I...
What do I do?

830
00:35:41,875 --> 00:35:43,207
You gotta tell him
what happened.

831
00:35:43,291 --> 00:35:45,374
Absolutely not. No.

832
00:35:45,458 --> 00:35:48,666
And don't you dare,
or I swear to God, Zoya,

833
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:50,207
I'll set a fire
and I'll blame it on you.

834
00:35:50,291 --> 00:35:52,916
<i> Hello? This
is Ms. Smith from the nurse's station.</i>

835
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:53,916
What's that noise?

836
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,999
<i>Is anyone there?
Hello? Hello?</i>

837
00:35:57,083 --> 00:35:58,916
- Hello?
<i>- Hello?</i>

838
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,791
- Hello?
<i>- Ms. Hope?</i>

839
00:36:00,875 --> 00:36:02,499
Yes. This is... this is...

840
00:36:02,583 --> 00:36:03,291
<i>We have an update
about your mother.</i>

841
00:36:03,375 --> 00:36:05,391
Okay.

842
00:36:06,083 --> 00:36:06,916
I might just get the subway.

843
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,041
- This late?
- It's not even 10:00.

844
00:36:10,125 --> 00:36:11,166
Zoya's still out.

845
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:12,874
We can go back upstairs,
talk some more,

846
00:36:12,958 --> 00:36:14,683
see if our taxi luck changes.

847
00:36:24,083 --> 00:36:27,041
You know, thanks again
for taking Zoya under your wing.

848
00:36:27,125 --> 00:36:29,207
It really means the world that
she has someone she can trust.

849
00:36:29,291 --> 00:36:32,016
- Next time, I'll cook?
- Next time.

850
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:41,683
Hi. I'm going to Bushwick and Myrtle.

851
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,041
<i> Spotted.</i>

852
00:36:45,125 --> 00:36:48,041
<i>Hot for teacher
plus hot for a teacher.</i>

853
00:36:48,125 --> 00:36:52,249
<i>Seems Z Daddy may be confusing
PTA with PDA.</i>

854
00:36:52,333 --> 00:36:53,582
<i>Whatever's going on,</i>

855
00:36:53,666 --> 00:36:56,183
<i>it's my kind of
after school special.</i>

856
00:36:59,625 --> 00:37:01,874
Hi.

857
00:37:01,958 --> 00:37:03,832
I ha... I have to go.
It's my mom.

858
00:37:03,916 --> 00:37:05,082
- Is she okay?
- I don't know.

859
00:37:05,166 --> 00:37:07,249
They say she is,
but I don't know.

860
00:37:07,333 --> 00:37:09,749
Look, I may have said something
to your parents, so I'm sorry.

861
00:37:09,833 --> 00:37:11,916
Sixty-ninth and York please.
It's an emergency.

862
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,207
It's okay. Whatever it is,
it'll be okay, all right?

863
00:37:14,291 --> 00:37:15,416
Okay. Okay. Okay.
Come here. I love you.

864
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:18,006
- Just call me when you get there, all right?
- Okay.

865
00:37:21,458 --> 00:37:22,582
Hey.

866
00:37:22,666 --> 00:37:24,499
- It's often hard to...
- Hey.

867
00:37:24,583 --> 00:37:26,848
- ...get in touch with him but...
- Hey, Obie.

868
00:37:27,958 --> 00:37:29,308
I'll be right there.

869
00:37:30,166 --> 00:37:31,391
Yeah?

870
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:33,600
You're mad.

871
00:37:37,041 --> 00:37:38,624
Why'd you have to go
so hard at him?

872
00:37:38,708 --> 00:37:39,957
Roger? He said it was fine.

873
00:37:40,041 --> 00:37:41,499
Of course he said
it was fine, Zoya.

874
00:37:41,583 --> 00:37:43,048
- And my mom...
- Your mom what?

875
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:46,475
Never mind.

876
00:37:47,458 --> 00:37:49,499
Yeah, she doesn't like me.
I get it.

877
00:37:49,583 --> 00:37:51,791
Should she, after
how you behaved in there?

878
00:37:51,875 --> 00:37:53,100
How I behaved?

879
00:37:54,554 --> 00:37:56,710
You know, I'm sure she thinks
that you're fine.

880
00:37:56,795 --> 00:38:00,305
Okay. Look, I know you
didn't want me coming tonight,

881
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:02,166
but you know something?
I'm glad that I did.

882
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:05,416
Because now I know that
your mom's not the problem.

883
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:06,999
It's how you are
when you're around her.

884
00:38:07,083 --> 00:38:07,791
Of course it's not her.
Like it's not Simon.

885
00:38:07,875 --> 00:38:09,249
Like it's not Gossip Girl.

886
00:38:09,333 --> 00:38:12,624
Like it's not any number
of things that you blame.

887
00:38:12,708 --> 00:38:15,499
The problem is me, and the fact that
you don't seem to like me anymore.

888
00:38:15,583 --> 00:38:17,183
Pot, meet the kettle.

889
00:38:17,625 --> 00:38:19,124
Zoya, what are you saying?

890
00:38:19,208 --> 00:38:20,416
Julien said to stand up
for myself tonight,

891
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:23,166
to not let you pull away,
to... to fight for what I want.

892
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:26,249
But I guess that only works
for you and your mom

893
00:38:26,333 --> 00:38:27,249
- if it's Julien.
- Wow.

894
00:38:27,333 --> 00:38:29,166
I see how you are
when you're around her.

895
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:31,457
You'll really grasp at anything,
won't you?

896
00:38:31,541 --> 00:38:32,916
- Except...
- Except what?

897
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,225
Otto...

898
00:38:35,083 --> 00:38:36,308
The car.

899
00:38:38,125 --> 00:38:40,141
Obie, tell her
we're still talking.

900
00:38:41,708 --> 00:38:43,683
I have to go.

901
00:38:44,208 --> 00:38:46,475
You're already gone, aren't you?

902
00:38:54,333 --> 00:38:55,808
Nice to have met you, dear.

903
00:39:04,625 --> 00:39:06,041
Do not go anywhere! Please!

904
00:39:06,125 --> 00:39:09,207
How long were you waiting there,
creeper?

905
00:39:09,291 --> 00:39:11,207
I knew it wasn't
a casual dinner.

906
00:39:11,291 --> 00:39:13,207
Plus, weekends are my shift.

907
00:39:13,291 --> 00:39:15,999
And bullet point six
in your manila manifesto

908
00:39:16,083 --> 00:39:19,207
was to keep up posts on teachers
to avert suspicion.

909
00:39:19,291 --> 00:39:21,374
Doesn't feel good being
a subject, though, does it?

910
00:39:21,458 --> 00:39:23,457
That gossip shoe
is on the other girl's foot,

911
00:39:23,541 --> 00:39:25,082
and that metaphor
didn't work at all,

912
00:39:25,166 --> 00:39:26,707
- so I'm gonna stop.
- I was there

913
00:39:26,791 --> 00:39:29,541
to get more information
on Zoya and Julien's mother,

914
00:39:29,625 --> 00:39:30,874
which I did.

915
00:39:30,958 --> 00:39:32,541
Great. Give it to me.
I'll post it.

916
00:39:32,625 --> 00:39:34,624
I can't. He'll know
it was from me.

917
00:39:34,708 --> 00:39:36,874
So you got information
you can never use?

918
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:41,207
I can use it at some point,
very strategically.

919
00:39:41,291 --> 00:39:43,082
You lost all objectivity

920
00:39:43,166 --> 00:39:45,291
the second you stepped foot
in that apartment.

921
00:39:45,375 --> 00:39:47,124
You should have said no
to dinner.

922
00:39:47,208 --> 00:39:50,207
You wanna play God?
You have to be above it all.

923
00:39:50,291 --> 00:39:52,957
You can't expose the truth
when you're a part of it.

924
00:39:53,041 --> 00:39:54,207
It's not that simple.

925
00:39:54,291 --> 00:39:58,766
And once you end it with him,
and with Zoya, it will be again.

926
00:40:04,833 --> 00:40:07,400
- What?
- I'm proud of you, that's all.

927
00:40:07,485 --> 00:40:09,432
You said you'd do something
great with your platform,

928
00:40:09,517 --> 00:40:11,576
and you did.

929
00:40:11,833 --> 00:40:13,418
It's the Calloway guarantee,
right?

930
00:40:16,333 --> 00:40:19,332
Is Luna trying to
talk you out of Sephora?

931
00:40:19,416 --> 00:40:21,374
No. I'm waiting on Zoya.

932
00:40:21,458 --> 00:40:22,916
She told me she'd call me
after dinner

933
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,957
and tell me how it went,
but it's 11:00.

934
00:40:25,041 --> 00:40:26,166
And what are you hoping to hear?

935
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:28,166
That it went well
or that it didn't?

936
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:29,332
Of course that it went well.

937
00:40:29,416 --> 00:40:32,624
You can tell me you still have
feelings for him.

938
00:40:32,708 --> 00:40:35,600
Maybe I still have feelings
for him, but Obie's with Zoya.

939
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:38,808
Not right now, he isn't.

940
00:40:43,375 --> 00:40:45,582
Hey.
What are you doing here?

941
00:40:45,666 --> 00:40:48,391
Hey, can you stop, uh,
messing with my life, please?

942
00:40:49,833 --> 00:40:51,707
What? How am I messing
with your life?

943
00:40:51,791 --> 00:40:53,291
Um, ambushing my mom,

944
00:40:53,375 --> 00:40:55,249
telling Zoya to invite herself
to family dinner, and...

945
00:40:55,333 --> 00:40:56,707
encouraging her
to Zoya all over everyone

946
00:40:56,791 --> 00:40:58,666
once she's there.

947
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:00,683
- I was just trying to help.
- Why?

948
00:41:01,541 --> 00:41:02,624
Why are you trying to help?

949
00:41:02,708 --> 00:41:04,393
What do you mean, "Why?"
She's my sister.

950
00:41:04,478 --> 00:41:06,453
And that's it?

951
00:41:06,934 --> 00:41:08,999
You're not trying to sabotage it
like the birthday party

952
00:41:09,083 --> 00:41:10,041
or the... the fashion show?

953
00:41:10,126 --> 00:41:12,226
I'm not trying
to sabotage anything.

954
00:41:12,416 --> 00:41:14,350
I want you to be happy.

955
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:16,499

981
00:42:41,833 --> 00:42:43,707
It's pretty ballsy,
protesting your parents.

00:42:43,791 --> 00:42:45,850
- Do you think it's bad?
- You kidding?

Yes.

988
00:43:11,083 --> 00:43:12,308
I saw that.

989
00:43:12,916 --> 00:43:14,141
She speaks.

990
00:43:14,708 --> 00:43:16,391
A little too much, apparently.

00:43:17,041 --> 00:43:18,624

of judgmental grandstanding.

993
00:43:22,208 --> 00:43:23,993
I'm sure it couldn't have been
that bad.

994
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,457
Hey, Dad,

995
00:43:27,541 --> 00:43:29,850
how do you know when to speak up
or... or stay quiet?

996
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:33,124
As a general rule,

997
00:43:33,208 --> 00:43:34,707
I say speak up
whenever you feel you have to,

998
00:43:34,791 --> 00:43:37,332
if only to make up for the
hundreds of years we couldn't.

999
00:43:37,416 --> 00:43:40,558
But if you hurt someone
with your words,

1000
00:43:42,125 --> 00:43:43,750
you have to be able
to live with it,

1001
00:43:44,041 --> 00:43:45,266
or learn from it.

1002
00:43:46,083 --> 00:43:47,891
And an apology
can go a long way.

to do this to you, honey.

00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:22,016
We all do sometimes.

1053
00:46:23,458 --> 00:46:25,225
It's okay to ask for it.

Hmm. Yeah.

1060
00:46:43,583 --> 00:46:45,008

00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:50,766

- No. No, Max. Of course not.

1062
00:46:51,458 --> 00:46:53,999
Okay. Good. That's good.

1063
00:46:54,083 --> 00:46:56,475
He said he was concerned
about you...

1064
00:46:57,166 --> 00:46:59,016
at ten o'clock at night, then...

1065
00:47:00,083 --> 00:47:02,291
when I got over there,
he didn't wanna talk about you,

1066
00:47:02,375 --> 00:47:05,475
- so I put it together.
- And you just left?

1067
00:47:06,458 --> 00:47:09,141
I stayed for a drink,
and that was it.

1068
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:16,416
Has that been it?
With anyone since...

1069
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:20,707
You know, Max, that's really
none of your business.

1070
00:47:20,791 --> 00:47:22,541
It is when I have to
listen to Dad

1071
00:47:22,625 --> 00:47:25,558
cry himself to sleep
every night.

1072
00:47:26,791 --> 00:47:28,016
All right.

1073
00:47:28,958 --> 00:47:32,683
Watching Audrey go through
what she's going through,

1074
00:47:33,583 --> 00:47:35,683
never leaving her mom's side,

1075
00:47:36,833 --> 00:47:39,332
I didn't have to do that
with you,

1076
00:47:39,416 --> 00:47:41,350
but you've always
done that for me.

1077
00:47:43,541 --> 00:47:44,766
And I always will.

1078
00:47:47,166 --> 00:47:48,891
You need to do that with Dad.

1079
00:47:50,125 --> 00:47:52,832
Oh God, Maxie.

1080
00:47:52,916 --> 00:47:55,457
Rafa's not a good person.

1081
00:47:55,541 --> 00:47:58,475

Aki, Dad.

1238
00:56:07,166 --> 00:56:09,058
