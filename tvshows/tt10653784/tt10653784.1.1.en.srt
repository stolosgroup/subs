<i>If You guys want to know
how I keep my face fresh</i>

3
00:00:24,875 --> 00:00:26,205
<i>after early morning travel,</i>

4
00:00:26,291 --> 00:00:28,881
<i>I've reposted my crucial
fight-the-flight...</i>

5
00:00:28,958 --> 00:00:31,628
<i>I am so excited to see my
girls Monet and Luna today.</i>

6
00:00:31,708 --> 00:00:32,908
 Yay!

7
00:01:11,416 --> 00:01:13,456
Hey, Dad.

8
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:15,309
I'm in LA tonight
for a session with Billie.

9
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:18,583
Ooh.
I'll be back Friday, okay?

10
00:01:18,666 --> 00:01:21,286
 Have a great first day.
 I already am.

11
00:01:21,375 --> 00:01:22,851
You know, you're not
normally this excited

12
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:24,495
for the first day of school.

13
00:01:24,583 --> 00:01:27,293
Well, it's better than being
stuck in here for another year.

14
00:01:27,375 --> 00:01:28,575
 No shit.

15
00:01:29,416 --> 00:01:30,416
Bye.

16
00:01:35,916 --> 00:01:37,226
 You're gonna be late.
 He's always late.

17
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:39,960
Okay, here's your lunch.

18
00:01:40,041 --> 00:01:42,961
- And your ice pack.
Mm, perfect. Okay.

19
00:01:43,041 --> 00:01:43,751
Okay.

20
00:01:44,916 --> 00:01:46,166
- Okay.
- Love you.

21
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:48,540
Bye, Dad. Bye, Pop. Bye, Rocky.

22
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:49,375
- Here you go.

23
00:01:49,458 --> 00:01:50,684
- Thank you, Obie.
- Anytime, Murray.

24
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:57,496
Sorry it's taking
me a long time.

25
00:01:59,208 --> 00:02:00,888
We were together all
quarantine. It's fine.

26
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,960
You used to like it when
it took me a long time.

27
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:26,541
Where's my freshman?

28
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:28,535
Fresh-woman?

29
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:30,631
Fresh-person.

30
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:34,038
- Fresh-princess!
- Dad, please. No.

31
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:36,955
Sorry, I'm just excited.
It's your first day.

32
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:39,211
It's another day,
no first anything.

33
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:47,208
Constance Billard is one of
the top 10 private schools

34
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:50,131
in the country, with one
of the best arts programs.

35
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:51,748
Full of the type of
people whose values

36
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:53,934
- I was able to shield you from...
- Kids are bad all over.

37
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:54,998
Even in Buffalo.

38
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,170
We had to leave.

39
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:00,080
And we couldn't pass
up the scholarship.

40
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:02,916
I mean, at Constance, my college
choices are so much better.

41
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,460
Say it with me, Yale Drama.

42
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,710
- And...
- Yes, she's a student there,

43
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:10,291
but I doubt I'll
even get to meet her.

44
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:11,245
You're not even sure
she knows I exist.

45
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:13,083
She's your half-sister,
she knows you exist.

46
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:15,666
Well then, I don't
want to meet her.

47
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:16,580
Because she never
accepted my friend request

48
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:18,666
I sent when I was 10.

49
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:20,581
Thank you for breakfast.

50
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:22,083
Bye, Dad.

51
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:22,826
- I love you.
- You too.

52
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:25,746
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

53
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:27,233
- Bye.
- Hey, where'd you get those?

54
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:28,666
Hmm?

55
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:31,581
Moving gift from
Bella. Remember?

56
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:32,706
Huh.

57
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:49,376
- Lune?
- The brick'll wash her out.

58
00:03:57,458 --> 00:03:58,498
Up and to the left.

59
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:00,083
New EIP.

60
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:05,171
Ew. Go!

61
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,130
Don't they have their own
entrance or something?

62
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:08,808
I'm standing here.
You see me, don't you?

63
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:10,246
Okay come on, let's do this.

64
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:15,326
Okay. So, experience is:

65
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:18,496
"Arrival, first day,
uh, junior year."

66
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:20,253
Um, so just back
up a little bit.

67
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:23,208
Back up a little more.

68
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:26,001
Okay. Now, show me the bag.

69
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:30,326
Sorry, Ms. Keller, I
didn't see you there.

70
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:32,376
Um, it wasn't your fault.

71
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:34,328
She almost destroyed
your Capucine.

72
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:36,996
It'd take her whole month's
salary to replace it.

73
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:39,713
Rayon gives me nosebleeds.
Could you move?

74
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:41,331
God, now
the light's off.

75
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:42,326
- Kate?
- Yeah?

76
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:43,656
Thought we were meeting inside.

77
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:48,333
We should have a
no-Zara rule at school.

78
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:50,286
Zara, east of Lex only.

79
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:54,626
I don't know why I still
expect them to be nice.

80
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:56,828
I guess a year of
Zoom boxes fooled me?

81
00:04:56,916 --> 00:04:58,184
That's only 'cause
you couldn't see

82
00:04:58,208 --> 00:04:59,828
what they were
texting beneath them.

83
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:03,205
Oh, no.

84
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:05,131
First day of school and
Wendy's already sad.

85
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:07,668
The headmistress would like
to speak with you, Martine.

86
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:09,291
Right this way.

87
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,934
This
is why I bring a Yeti.

88
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:20,538
When the horde sets their alarms

89
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:22,705
to go off in unison
during a pop quiz,

90
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:24,631
I don't spill on
myself when I scream.

91
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:25,788
I could get you one.

92
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:28,535
It took me an
hour to pick out an outfit

93
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:30,065
I thought they
wouldn't make fun off.

94
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:31,476
And it took them one
second to prove me wrong.

95
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,920
If Julien wore that, Urban would
be mass producing knockoffs

96
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,710
by third period.

97
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:36,892
They just pick on
us 'cause they can.

98
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:38,956
Because no one says not to.

99
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:41,331
And if you try to fail them,

100
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:42,996
between your laptop
and the office,

101
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:44,383
an F becomes a C.

102
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:46,878
And a C becomes valedictorian

103
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:49,128
and a top spot at the
Ivy of their choice.

104
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:51,578
This school produced
great people.

105
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:53,996
Caroline Kennedy,
Colson Whitehead,

106
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:55,293
Nate Archibald.

107
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:56,245
It's why I wanted to teach here.

108
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:58,753
It's
not like Nate Archibald

109
00:05:58,833 --> 00:05:59,583
was such a saint
when we started.

110
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:02,956
- You went here, Rebecca?
- Class of '09.

111
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:05,171
Back when we still
respected authority.

112
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:08,580
Now, they can't be controlled
because we've ceased to matter.

113
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:10,351
Who needs an education when you're
famous for putting on your makeup?

114
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:12,915
- But you said Nate...
- When I was a student,

115
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,670
we lived under constant threat.

116
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,767
People like Nate
were scared straight.

117
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:18,421
How?

118
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,517
Yeah, I'd try anything
at this point.

119
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:22,131
It was this thing that
started freshman year,

120
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:24,458
called itself Gossip Girl.

121
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:27,081
Kind of like an
Orwellian Big Sister.

122
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:29,376
Kept tabs on students
it deemed important.

123
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:32,128
- Kept tabs?
- If she knew your secrets,

124
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:33,998
and she always did,

125
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:35,923
she told them. She kept
us all accountable.

126
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,130
People thought it was me,

127
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:39,808
but it was actually
one of my classmates.

128
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,333
- Dan Humphrey.
- The novelist?

129
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:43,286
I think I remember
reading about this.

130
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:45,625
It was ridiculous. I
wouldn't even read it.

131
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:55,250
It's a blog. Haven't seen
one of these in years.

132
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:58,003
Last post, nine years ago.

133
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:00,423
Ooh, there's an archive.

134
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,580
Some dead links,
but pretty cool.

135
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:05,996
Wish I thought of this
when I was in high school.

136
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:08,293
We're still
in high school.

137
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:09,495
Maybe we should try it?

138
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:15,498
What are we looking at?

139
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:18,101
Hey, hey, keep it moving.
Please and thank you.

140
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:22,501
- Oh! The sun's arrived.
He has indeed.

141
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:23,173
Maxi!

142
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,450
Air only. She's still setting.

143
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:30,833
- Obie!
- Hi.

144
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:36,825
You're rumpled and sweaty.

145
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:39,376
That suddenly
bothers you... why?

146
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:40,748
You said you'd do my story.

147
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,130
Shit, I forgot.

148
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:45,035
He forgot.

149
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:46,165
I was...

150
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:48,710
I was bringing breakfast to
the Navy Yard strike line,

151
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:50,041
but I saved you one.

152
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:51,665
Fan-Fan, your favorite.

153
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:52,670
Hey, isn't that your
parents' development?

154
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,550
Yeah, it is. And they
know exactly how I feel.

155
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:57,745
That the very least the
strikers deserve is donuts.

156
00:07:57,833 --> 00:07:59,213
And what about what I deserve?

157
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:01,331
I will clean up during
free period, I promise.

158
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:04,017
 Okay, at this point, it's gonna be a graduation story.
Julien!

159
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:05,184
- So can we...
-  Audrey!

160
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:06,476
- Welcome back, guys.
- Yo, what's up?

161
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,420
Well, well, if it isn't the
Seven Samurai all together again.

162
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,790
You can change the group
chat name all you want,

163
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:14,165
- it's not sticking.
- You'll get Kurosawa one day.

164
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:17,961
Is that what your face
looks like without a mask?

165
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:19,831
Hope, been a few.

166
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,184
Since when do you
show up on time

167
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:22,488
for the first day of the school?

168
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:24,434
Guess all those months away
gave me a renewed interest

169
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:25,998
in the student body.

170
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:28,713
- Yours included.
- Okay, soft focus, soft focus.

171
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:30,171
And east so your
face gets the sun.

172
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:33,080
The gram can wait, ladies.
She's looking for her sister.

173
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:36,246
- She's not my sister.
- A DNA test would disagree.

174
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,790
She's just half.

175
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:40,415
- Mm, you have a sister?
- He was busy at Berghain.

176
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,601
And you promised
never to mention her.

177
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:45,125
It's a big deal, and we
should not pretend otherwise.

178
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:48,668
She enrolled and moved
here like some stalker.

179
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:51,000
And if it wasn't for
Headmistress Burton,

180
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:53,173
who gave JC a heads-up, we
wouldn't have even known.

181
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:55,630
Their dads hate each other.

182
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:57,078
Oh, I remember.

183
00:08:57,166 --> 00:09:00,076
She's from when your mom
ran off on you and your dad?

184
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:01,576
Yeah, and if he
knew Zoya was here,

185
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,956
he would pull me out of
school or the hemisphere.

186
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:05,381
That's how angry he still is.

187
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:07,458
I can't believe she
didn't tell you herself.

188
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:10,753
Guys, it's okay.

189
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:11,463
She and I don't even
know each other.

190
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:13,631
We don't owe each
other anything.

191
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:17,538
And besides, I have everyone I need
right here, live and in person.

192
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:18,642
Family drama is so not my thing.

193
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:22,956
I'm more of a medical
procedural kind of guy,

194
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:25,001
two Addys to get
me through Calc,

195
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:27,883
and a benzo to slumber
through Vicki Fic.

196
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:47,038
Is that her?

197
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:50,171
Should we
throw our lattes on her?

198
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,040
Turmeric stains forever.

199
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,645
I don't know what
you're talking about.

200
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:54,828
I can't see freshmen.

201
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:00,253
I like her shoes.

202
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:04,673
This Chuck and Blair
thing is out of control.

203
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,580
Definitely pre-cancel culture.

204
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:07,666
Did you get to the part

205
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,750
where she was princess
of Monaco for six months?

206
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:11,673
Or when a high school senior

207
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,670
got a story published
in the<i> New Yorker?</i>

208
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:16,210
As a writer, I'm
a little jealous.

209
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:18,711
I mean, these posts are like
a lost Edith Wharton novel.

210
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:20,671
And just as white.

211
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,630
It goes to show, this
school has always been

212
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:24,517
a breeding ground for the
worst kinds of people.

213
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:25,421
Is
it really their fault

214
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,330
they inherited
power and influence

215
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:29,206
the minute they were born

216
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:31,711
without any examples
of how not to abuse it?

217
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:34,581
You're defending them? After
what they just did to you?

218
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:37,626
I'm only saying we're
their last hope.

219
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:40,788
We're supposed to send them
out of here Barack Obamas,

220
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:42,705
instead of Brett Kavanaughs.

221
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:44,331
How? We have no power.

222
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:45,536
Sure we do.

223
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,670
Fucking got fired.

224
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:53,791
The headmistress was on
the phone with parents

225
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:55,325
- all morning.
- Parents?

226
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:57,684
It was something about me refusing
to change a grade last year?

227
00:10:57,708 --> 00:10:59,559
And there were other
teachers waiting when I left.

228
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:02,423
I mean, it's a...
It's a blood bath.

229
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:04,448
Today, the first day of school?

230
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,170
If you want to show you're in
charge, you need an audience.

231
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:10,208
Who's our last hope, Kate?

232
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:11,833
We could be next.

233
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:13,330
You don't have to be.

234
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:17,875
What's this?

235
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:20,208
Power.

236
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:33,173
Let's see if this
gets their attention.

237
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:54,125
Let me see it.

238
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:58,538
Yours is better.

239
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:01,495
No way. My friend did
mine with a seam ripper.

240
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:02,963
- Okay, true.

241
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:04,251
I got mine done by Dr. Woo.

242
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:06,293
But still, I'm so happy
to finally meet you.

243
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:08,075
You're not just in my
chat history anymore,

244
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:10,246
- you're actually here.
- I know. Davis?

245
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:12,575
No idea. Nick?

246
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:15,286
Knows you go here, but thinks
you have no idea who I am.

247
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:16,165
So
we're good for now.

248
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:18,750
Julien Elizabeth.

249
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:19,993
- Zoya Jane.

250
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:23,748
I can't believe
you're really here.

251
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:26,633
I know, I thought no fucking
way my dad would go for moving.

252
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:28,288
But when I got
the scholarship...

253
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:30,788
I can't believe we
pulled this off.

254
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:33,493
That's not what I meant. I...

255
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,110
I can't believe
you're really here.

256
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:40,326
You look just like her.

257
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:49,830
I have this whole plan to incorporate
you into our friend group.

258
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:52,666
- Are you sure you can't just...
- This'll be easier.

259
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:53,670
They'll like you for
you and not because

260
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:56,830
you're related to me.
Met Steps at 11:00.

261
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:58,642
I was told freshmen don't
have open campus privileges.

262
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:00,746
We own this school.
They work for us.

263
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:05,166
Do you like the sneakers?

264
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,517
- I feel a little weird about...
- They were free.

265
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:08,461
Don't even worry about it.

266
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:10,001
And I've already
planted the seed

267
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:11,503
that I liked them on you.

268
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,793
So I'll wave you over to
get them for my story, okay?

269
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:15,285
Just like we planned.

270
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:17,375
Now get to class. I can be
late, but you shouldn't.

271
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:18,788
You're here!

272
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:28,463
Dumbo Hall tonight, dears.

273
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:32,631
And a reminder, it
is fashion week,

274
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:33,748
so<i> accoutre</i> accordingly.

275
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:36,883
I'm actually stuffing
envelopes after school,

276
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:38,378
so I'll be late.

277
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:39,642
And probably rumpled and sweaty.

278
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:42,786
And you said you
would come with me.

279
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:44,785
Yeah, just so you'd
quit asking me.

280
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:50,041
- Who waits for the light?
- She's not from here.

281
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:52,285
I still don't know who
you're talking about.

282
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:54,825
You know what would trend
faster than a fall fashion fail?

283
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:56,916
A "secret sister" splosh video.

284
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,630
I've got the heels, and I'd love
nothing more than to just...

285
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:04,791
Hey!

286
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:08,245
Are those Bey Superstars?

287
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:12,133
- Yeah.
- Can I get a picture?

288
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:15,246
Just 'cause our dads
hate each other,

289
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:16,753
doesn't mean we have to, right?

290
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:18,142
What are you doing?

291
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:19,706
What if she's cool?

292
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:21,291
She has a headband on.

293
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:23,175
It's actually
a scarf. It was my...

294
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:25,326
Our mom's.

295
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:27,498
Let's do this instead.

296
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,990
The Right To The City Alliance?

297
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:40,291
Yeah, they... I, uh,
I volunteer with them.

298
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:42,285
See, someone else
has heard of it.

299
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:43,285
They're doing great work.

300
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:45,125
They try
to halt displacement

301
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:48,458
of marginalized communities
in historic neighborhoods.

302
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:51,041
My grandpa used to work with
them until he passed away.

303
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:52,184
If you ever need
another body, I'm in.

304
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:54,828
I've been trying to get this
guy to go for, like, months.

305
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:57,956
I think it's cool
you work with them.

306
00:14:58,041 --> 00:15:00,461
You ever heard of
the guilty rich?

307
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:02,341
- This one's the guiltiest.
- And the richest.

308
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:10,038
- What's your handle?
- Uh, ALottaZee, with two E's.

309
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:11,365
As soon as I post this,

310
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:13,076
you're gonna get a
load of new followers.

311
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:14,785
Pro tip: Best to use your name.

312
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:16,684
- That way, anyone can find you.

313
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:20,168
Why would I want
people to find me?

314
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,809
How would you like to hang out
with us tonight at Dumbo Hall?

315
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:23,753
It's this members-only
club we go to.

316
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:26,293
I don't know, it's
a school night.

317
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:28,205
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy.

318
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:30,392
If you close your eyes, she
disappears, I'm telling you.

319
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:32,166
- We don't stay out late.
- We don't?

320
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,290
I'm not a member.

321
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:34,788
I'll put you on the list.

322
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:37,665
So as long as
everyone else agrees?

323
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:42,250
Maybe my Xanny just kicked
in, but I say why not.

324
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:44,293
She's cute enough.

325
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:50,628
It would be nice to have
someone to run errands.

326
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:54,083
Sure.

327
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:56,083
Welcome.

328
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:57,666
See you at 7:00.

329
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:08,168
- Bye.
- Bye.

330
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,250
Peace.

331
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:13,418
Not even a like.
- As if it didn't happen.

332
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,250
We should've known. Is anyone
under 30 even on Twitter?

333
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:17,883
I'd delete that if I were you.

334
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:21,628
Retaliation never
works. Ask my ex-wives.

335
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:24,288
I'm not a lesbian.

336
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:32,463
Trio of sad incoming.

337
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:34,541
Which one of them
should I get fired next?

338
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:36,375
What did you just say?

339
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:37,517
No, I wasn't talking to you.

340
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:41,211
About you, maybe, but... that
depends on your behavior.

341
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:42,771
But I'm pretty sure
you know that now.

342
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,710
My house, tonight.

343
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:01,833
So, we covered your
commute, your classes,

344
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:04,036
the creepy hot dog guy
who liked your uniform...

345
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:08,626
Okay, Dad.

346
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:12,378
I saw her once from across
the courtyard. That's it.

347
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:14,218
And I'm pretty sure
that's how it's gonna be.

348
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:15,915
But...

349
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:19,205
- I met some great new people.
- Hmm.

350
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:22,581
And one of them invited me
to go get gelato with her.

351
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,026
- Oh, that's nice.
Tonight.

352
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:26,206
- Well...
- In the Village.

353
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:27,833
No way. It's a school night.

354
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:30,456
Come on, Dad, this
is New York City.

355
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:33,131
Seven o'clock here is
like four in Buffalo.

356
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:35,038
And if I say no to
the first invitation,

357
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:36,625
who knows if I'll get any more?

358
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:40,751
So long as you're back by 9:00.

359
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:42,746
Nine?

360
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:45,333
If you prove to me you can
be responsible this time,

361
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:48,576
maybe you'll be able to say
yes to those future invitations

362
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:50,576
and stay out even longer.

363
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:53,995
Fair. Thank you.

364
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,830
Hey. Jimmy, right?
- Mm-hmm.

365
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:12,892
I'm Zoya, we just moved...
We're staying at my grandma's.

366
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:15,496
Did someone drop something off?

367
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:18,333
Yeah, the courier
said not to call up.

368
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:20,456
It's a... It's a
surprise for my dad.

369
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:32,285
Twitter is a
glorified chat room

370
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:33,684
for meme sharing,
conspiracy theorists,

371
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:36,378
and Lin-Manuel Miranda.

372
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:38,128
If we really want
to get attention,

373
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:39,538
it's Instagram only.

374
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:42,325
Gossip Girl was also
voice-y. It drew you in.

375
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:44,666
"Spotted: Chuck Bass
losing something

376
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:47,880
no one knew he had: His heart."

377
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:49,208
I can write in that style.

378
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:51,881
And we need to tag people
for maximum effect.

379
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:53,248
That way we know they'll see it.

380
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:55,883
- The whole school?
Just the popular kids,

381
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:58,578
like Serenas, Blairs,
Nates, and Chucks.

382
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:01,076
Make them think there's another
Dan Humphrey in their midst.

383
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:02,876
Gossip Girl would
have been nothing

384
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:05,038
without Blair versus Serena.

385
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:08,165
Their rivalry launched
her. We need our own.

386
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,460
Well, clearly
Monet and everyone.

387
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:12,211
Monet's
the school villain.

388
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:13,541
No one cares.

389
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:16,745
We need to center someone
people are actually drawn to.

390
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:17,833
Like Julien.

391
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:20,705
Not only is she famous,
people actually like her.

392
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:22,291
Julien has no rival.

393
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:24,535
Who knew what Blair and
Serena's relationship

394
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:26,535
was actually like?

395
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:29,535
Gossip Girl's
perception was reality.

396
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:31,575
So we create our own.

397
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:35,416
- Who do we think Julien might...
- Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

398
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,580
We might not have
to make up anything.

399
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:40,246
You know about
her sister, right?

400
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:41,963
I was on her admissions panel.

401
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:43,751
But do you know
how she got there?

402
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:47,963
Is that real?

403
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:50,671
Better than I could've imagined.

404
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,790
So you'll use that?

405
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:56,245
The old Gossip Girl knew
how to tease things out.

406
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:58,753
She got their attention first,
and then went in for the kill.

407
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:00,833
So we do the same.

408
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:02,833
We wait on this.

409
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:05,043
Just a little bit.

410
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:08,625
You ready to, uh,
take the power back,

411
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:11,378
do some good, and
save the future?

412
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:12,958
I'm gonna need your
Gossip Girl voice

413
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:14,751
to be better than
your real voice.

414
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:16,293
It is.

415
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:18,705
- I say we do it.
- You got my vote.

416
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:28,165
<i>Hello,
followers. Gossip Girl here.</i>

417
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,290
<i>Your one and only
source for the truth</i>

418
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:33,285
<i>behind the scandalous
lies of New York's elite.</i>

419
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:35,705
<i>Been a minute. Did you miss me?</i>

420
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:37,331
<i>I know I've missed you.</i>

421
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:39,793
<i>Though you're
probably going to wish</i>

422
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:40,785
<i>I'd stayed away when I'm done.</i>

423
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:43,285
<i>Because I can see you.</i>

424
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:46,375
<i>Not the you you've
oh-so-carefully curated.</i>

425
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:47,828
<i>The real you.</i>

426
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:51,166
<i>The one hiding just
outside the edge of frame.</i>

427
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:54,000
<i>Well, it's time to
reframe that picture.</i>

428
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:56,833
<i>You've gotten away with
everything a little too long.</i>

429
00:20:56,916 --> 00:20:57,996
<i>Now that I'm back,</i>

430
00:20:58,083 --> 00:20:59,333
<i>I'm gonna feature your finstas,</i>

431
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:04,246
<i>surface those subtweets,
and crack your caches.</i>

432
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:07,673
<i>You can't hide from
me. Never could.</i>

433
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,250
<i>And to prove it,
there's a big secret</i>

434
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:13,173
<i>amongst the ruling class
at Constance Billard.</i>

435
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:15,130
<i>And as you will
soon come to know,</i>

436
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:18,248
<i>no good secret goes unpublished.</i>

437
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:20,416
<i>Watch this space.</i>

438
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
<i>Or don't.</i>

439
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:24,581
<i>You'll hear about it
soon enough either way.</i>

440
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:26,535
<i>Till then,</i>

441
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:29,455
<i>XOXO, Gossip Girl.</i>

442
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:36,213
- Um, did you see
that thing we were tagged in?

443
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:39,331
You turned off my
notifications, remember?

444
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:41,496
What kind of person calls
themselves Gossip Girl?

445
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:44,003
Yeah, it's the 21st century.
At least be a Gossip Woman.

446
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:46,833
Is this that Syosset
strip mall party store

447
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:48,996
that tried to offer
me a sponsorship deal?

448
00:21:49,083 --> 00:21:52,003
Probably some regional tween
hoping to boost his TikTok.

449
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:54,253
- Blocked and buried.

450
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:56,791
Mm, where's Obie?

451
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:15,253
Whoa, I did not
recognize you at all.

452
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:18,213
Um, it's the dress.

453
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:19,883
It's new.

454
00:22:19,958 --> 00:22:21,418
Yeah, it looks like, uh

455
00:22:22,916 --> 00:22:24,206
you look like Julien.

456
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:25,751
Is that a compliment?

457
00:22:28,375 --> 00:22:31,415
It's typical for you to
be so trusting and open.

458
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,290
That's why people follow you.
They think that they know you

459
00:22:34,375 --> 00:22:35,915
and they feel
entitled to your life,

460
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,750
which they aren't.

461
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:38,923
Zoya's not some
crazy stalker, Audge.

462
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,380
But she is a semi-stranger

463
00:22:41,458 --> 00:22:45,078
who has, by some
fortuitous coincidence,

464
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:47,416
found herself at your school,

465
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,880
- in your friend group...

466
00:22:52,875 --> 00:22:54,285
With your boyfriend?

467
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,170
I'm gonna get us another
round. We're gonna need it.

468
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:01,920
Look, I, um... I
almost forgot, I...

469
00:23:02,708 --> 00:23:03,788
I brought you this.

470
00:23:03,875 --> 00:23:06,245
And I don't know if it goes
with the dress or whatever...

471
00:23:06,333 --> 00:23:09,213
It goes with
everything. Thank you.

472
00:23:10,708 --> 00:23:12,428
Hey.
What up, Obes?

473
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:15,168
Hey.

474
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:17,420
Thank you for coming. You
only have to stay an hour,

475
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,392
and then I'll come to whatever
rally you want next time.

476
00:23:19,416 --> 00:23:23,456
- He hates this place.
- Yes, I do. Very much so, yes.

477
00:23:23,541 --> 00:23:25,461
I mean, if one tenth
of these people donated

478
00:23:25,541 --> 00:23:27,559
the price of one drink to a
charity of their choice...

479
00:23:27,583 --> 00:23:29,263
They are the charity
of their choice, Obes,

480
00:23:29,291 --> 00:23:32,131
and that one drink is
to help them forget

481
00:23:32,208 --> 00:23:34,498
what people like
you ask of them.

482
00:23:34,583 --> 00:23:37,793
As for me, I have got very
tight plans for the night.

483
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:40,995
A bourbon, couple
bumps, <i>è tutto.</i>

484
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:42,503
It's a school night, after all.

485
00:23:42,583 --> 00:23:44,392
Aren't you tired of playing
"who's going to win tonight?"

486
00:23:44,416 --> 00:23:47,126
Well, it's not a
game if everyone can.

487
00:23:52,333 --> 00:23:53,383
Nice hand-me-down.

488
00:23:53,458 --> 00:23:55,168
- Audrey.
It's clearly not hers.

489
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:57,080
It's a fact. I'm
speaking factually.

490
00:23:59,583 --> 00:24:03,543
- Um, she's right. Julien...
- A gift. The first of many.

491
00:24:03,625 --> 00:24:04,625
To make up for the ones

492
00:24:04,708 --> 00:24:05,988
we didn't get to
give each other.

493
00:24:06,916 --> 00:24:08,166
Olives or twist?

494
00:24:10,125 --> 00:24:11,705
I say twist.

495
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:20,706
You don't have to drink.
We don't peer pressure.

496
00:24:20,791 --> 00:24:22,081
Yeah, I don't.

497
00:24:22,166 --> 00:24:22,916
- Topo Chico?
- Thanks.

498
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,750
More for me.

499
00:24:24,833 --> 00:24:27,383
Constance can be a great school
if you know how to play it.

500
00:24:27,458 --> 00:24:30,998
I'll tell you everything
you need in order to do so.

501
00:24:31,083 --> 00:24:32,883
St. Jude's used to
be its own building,

502
00:24:32,958 --> 00:24:35,498
and the boys still
act like it is.

503
00:24:35,583 --> 00:24:38,423
The only place we really mix is
out front or in the courtyard.

504
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,420
Be careful. It's a fishbowl,

505
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:42,040
so look your best, because
you will be watched.

506
00:24:42,125 --> 00:24:44,035
We use IG for stories,
Signal for sexts,

507
00:24:44,125 --> 00:24:46,375
and WhatsApp for abroad,
and Messages to chat.

508
00:24:46,458 --> 00:24:48,226
- What about YouTube?
Don't interrupt.

509
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:50,000
Especially not to say "YouTube."

510
00:24:50,083 --> 00:24:51,726
Personalize your uniform.
Freshmen are scared to,

511
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:52,540
but you shouldn't be.
It makes you unique,

512
00:24:52,625 --> 00:24:54,955
and it's a middle
finger to the matriarchy

513
00:24:55,041 --> 00:24:56,921
who haven't realized
they're upholding a system

514
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,460
the patriarchy put into place.

515
00:24:58,541 --> 00:25:00,517
Sant Ambroeus or Yura for coffee,
Starbucks for group orders.

516
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:02,809
The Met Steps or the Great Lawn
to hang, not the south side.

517
00:25:02,833 --> 00:25:05,173
JG Melon's for burgers,
though they check IDs.

518
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:07,750
Momoya if you're west.
Mezzaluna, not Sarafina's.

519
00:25:07,833 --> 00:25:10,543
Sweetgreen, but for pickup
only. Dumbo Hall, not House.

520
00:25:10,625 --> 00:25:12,915
And Lyft, never Uber.
Black, never Lux.

521
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,500
And don't use your real
address. For privacy and safety,

522
00:25:15,583 --> 00:25:17,633
- always a block away.
- I take the bus.

523
00:25:21,166 --> 00:25:22,536
You probably come from a school

524
00:25:22,625 --> 00:25:24,245
where people get to
know their teachers.

525
00:25:24,833 --> 00:25:25,423
Nobody does that here.

526
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,380
They're never around long enough

527
00:25:27,458 --> 00:25:29,418
to develop a
relationship with anyway.

528
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,920
- They're always leaving.
- Whether they want to or not.

529
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,210
Probably because private
school teachers get paid

530
00:25:34,291 --> 00:25:35,971
substantially less than
public school ones.

531
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,630
- They do?
That explains so much.

532
00:25:38,708 --> 00:25:39,878
- Zara.
- Zara.

533
00:25:39,958 --> 00:25:41,328
It's criminal how
little they make.

534
00:25:41,416 --> 00:25:43,876
Less than customer
service representatives,

535
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,460
executive assistants,
retail salespeople.

536
00:25:46,541 --> 00:25:47,581
Oh my God.

537
00:25:47,666 --> 00:25:50,286
And wouldn't Ms. Keller be
so much happier at Madewell?

538
00:25:50,375 --> 00:25:52,325
Yeah, Jules, come on.
She works really hard.

539
00:25:52,416 --> 00:25:54,626
Ms. Keller actually
interviewed me

540
00:25:54,708 --> 00:25:55,851
for the scholarship. I
thought she was great.

541
00:25:55,875 --> 00:25:58,535
Right, I've been trying to
get her to get this for years.

542
00:25:59,375 --> 00:26:01,165
Oh my God. Um,
what's your number?

543
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:02,670
I'll add you to the group text.

544
00:26:05,916 --> 00:26:07,916
I'm gonna go find my boyfriend.

545
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,040
Poor Audrey Hope. Married
and monogamous at 16.

546
00:26:35,125 --> 00:26:37,375
Nothing poor about it.
Don't straight-shame me.

547
00:26:37,458 --> 00:26:40,878
Do you ever miss coloring
outside the lines?

548
00:26:40,958 --> 00:26:42,418
Or did you never?

549
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,900
So with all the
people in this room,

550
00:26:44,166 --> 00:26:47,166
at this very moment,

551
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:49,670
you want to spend your
augmented energy on me?

552
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:51,630
I don't know what it
is with you and Ak,

553
00:26:51,708 --> 00:26:52,918
but something's different.

554
00:26:54,333 --> 00:26:55,423
In a good way?

555
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:58,130
Oh, yeah. The best way.

556
00:27:02,083 --> 00:27:03,923
This isn't on my
plan for tonight.

557
00:27:04,916 --> 00:27:06,116
It's all yours if you want it.

558
00:27:08,208 --> 00:27:09,038
You want it?

559
00:27:22,625 --> 00:27:23,625
Oh well.

560
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:32,250
What are you doing?

561
00:27:36,583 --> 00:27:37,423
What's going on?

562
00:28:03,916 --> 00:28:05,326
Shh.

563
00:28:15,291 --> 00:28:19,001
- Huh?

564
00:28:19,083 --> 00:28:23,293
<i>Spotted: Calloway
and her crew at Dumbo Hall</i>

565
00:28:23,375 --> 00:28:26,495
<i>with a little something
extra, her sudden sis.</i>

566
00:28:26,583 --> 00:28:28,923
<i>Sorry to crash the party, JC,</i>

567
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,630
<i>but I've got a pic that says</i>

568
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:32,458
<i>the thousand words
you've yet to utter.</i>

569
00:28:32,541 --> 00:28:35,211
<i>Everyone knows, 15 years ago,</i>

570
00:28:35,291 --> 00:28:39,751
<i>Mama Marion dumped DJ Davis for
a new life with Nick Nobody,</i>

571
00:28:39,833 --> 00:28:43,383
<i>yet sadly passed before she
could see her daughters united.</i>

572
00:28:43,458 --> 00:28:45,248
<i>Yet unite they have.</i>

573
00:28:45,333 --> 00:28:47,173
<i>Though you wouldn't
know it to look at them.</i>

574
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:49,960
<i>Never met before?
That's the ruse.</i>

575
00:28:50,041 --> 00:28:51,711
<i>Zoya's entrance to Constance</i>

576
00:28:51,791 --> 00:28:53,631
<i>was signed, sealed,
and deceitful.</i>

577
00:28:53,708 --> 00:28:56,788
<i>Or didn't you know? On
the Upper East Side,</i>

578
00:28:56,875 --> 00:28:59,455
<i>scholarships aren't
granted, they're gifted.</i>

579
00:28:59,541 --> 00:29:01,251
What is this thing
talking about?

580
00:29:01,916 --> 00:29:03,076
How should I know?

581
00:29:03,166 --> 00:29:05,576
I got that scholarship
on my own, right?

582
00:29:07,041 --> 00:29:09,881
- You didn't buy that for me.
- Of course not.

583
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:13,421
My dad gives money
to the school,

584
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:16,000
part of which goes to
fund the art scholarship.

585
00:29:16,083 --> 00:29:18,083
He doesn't have time to
read the apps, so I do.

586
00:29:18,166 --> 00:29:19,726
And since you have a
passion for theater...

587
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:22,250
Did you know when you
asked me to apply for it

588
00:29:22,333 --> 00:29:24,309
that you would be the one
deciding who gets put forward?

589
00:29:24,333 --> 00:29:25,543
Wh... what?

590
00:29:25,625 --> 00:29:26,976
Did someone deserve
it more than me?

591
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,710
Why would you think someone else
deserves something more than you?

592
00:29:29,791 --> 00:29:31,751
Wait, you two already
know each other?

593
00:29:31,833 --> 00:29:33,713
- On purpose?
- Who cares?

594
00:29:33,791 --> 00:29:35,751
Refresh, it's gone already.

595
00:29:35,833 --> 00:29:36,423
Why would you lie?

596
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:37,920
We don't lie to each other.

597
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,540
If our dads knew, they never
would have let her move here.

598
00:29:41,625 --> 00:29:42,875
They just found out.

599
00:29:43,541 --> 00:29:44,541
Didn't they?

600
00:29:46,125 --> 00:29:49,825
- My dad's not on Instagram.
- My dad's publicist runs his.

601
00:29:49,916 --> 00:29:51,876
And we are not your dad.

602
00:29:51,958 --> 00:29:55,668
I know. It's just, I wanted
to make sure that we...

603
00:29:56,291 --> 00:29:58,331
- That I...
- Liked me?

604
00:29:58,416 --> 00:30:00,246
- No, that's not...
Oh, oh, oh.

605
00:30:00,333 --> 00:30:03,293
So you were afraid
that Z would be Z's.

606
00:30:06,625 --> 00:30:08,705
I don't want to
lose my place here.

607
00:30:08,791 --> 00:30:11,541
In fact, I can't... I can't
actually afford to stay here

608
00:30:11,625 --> 00:30:11,825
without that scholarship.

609
00:30:12,583 --> 00:30:14,583
So please, make it make sense,

610
00:30:14,666 --> 00:30:16,416
who would do
something like this?

611
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,540
Students work in the office.

612
00:30:18,625 --> 00:30:19,165
Someone is clearly
trying to fuck with me,

613
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:21,000
but it's nothing.

614
00:30:22,166 --> 00:30:24,576
It's just gossip. We're fine.

615
00:30:25,333 --> 00:30:26,173
It doesn't matter.

616
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:28,790
Nobody cares, right?
Do any of you care?

617
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:36,498
I'm gonna go.

618
00:30:36,583 --> 00:30:38,423
You said you would
do the story first.

619
00:30:54,125 --> 00:30:55,535
You could've told me.

620
00:30:59,083 --> 00:31:00,543
- I'll walk out with you.
- Yeah.

621
00:31:07,125 --> 00:31:07,875
You know, what
Julien said is right.

622
00:31:07,958 --> 00:31:10,248
I mean, the whole
Gossip Girl thing,

623
00:31:10,333 --> 00:31:12,173
it's just somebody
playing a game.

624
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:14,580
It's a lot of trouble
for just a game.

625
00:31:14,666 --> 00:31:16,184
I mean, creating an
account, teasing us all day,

626
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:18,788
and then dropping a bomb just
to publicly shame her and me?

627
00:31:18,875 --> 00:31:22,625
It comes with
the territory up here.

628
00:31:22,708 --> 00:31:24,538
And if you have something
that people want,

629
00:31:25,291 --> 00:31:26,961
you have something to lose.

630
00:31:27,041 --> 00:31:29,331
Right? People try
and take us down.

631
00:31:29,416 --> 00:31:30,416
They never can, though.

632
00:31:31,416 --> 00:31:33,626
And you're one of us now.

633
00:31:33,708 --> 00:31:36,458
- Oh, shit!

634
00:31:36,541 --> 00:31:37,934
- Shit, shit, shit, shit...
- All right, look, the C station

635
00:31:37,958 --> 00:31:40,248
is just a few more
blocks up, all right?

636
00:31:40,333 --> 00:31:41,851
And what happens when I get out
at the other end, where it's four?

637
00:31:41,875 --> 00:31:44,665
I don't know if I have
to give this dress back.

638
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:45,880
I do live right there,

639
00:31:45,958 --> 00:31:48,788
if you wanna just wait
it out with me for a bit?

640
00:31:52,958 --> 00:31:54,476
- Yes, sure, okay.
- Yeah, okay, all right.

641
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,750
- Just for a bit.
- Great.

642
00:32:02,416 --> 00:32:03,826
You have the whole floor?

643
00:32:05,083 --> 00:32:06,083
Um, the building.

644
00:32:10,416 --> 00:32:12,496
Uh, if you... If want
to give me your dress,

645
00:32:12,583 --> 00:32:15,043
I can go hang it in the sauna
and it'll be dry in no time.

646
00:32:16,708 --> 00:32:18,538
And then,

647
00:32:18,625 --> 00:32:19,726
you know, you can just
borrow an umbrella.

648
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:24,830
Oh. Okay. Um,
where can I change?

649
00:32:24,916 --> 00:32:27,706
If we get these floors
wet, my mom will kill me.

650
00:32:29,583 --> 00:32:30,583
So...

651
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:33,290
I won't look.

652
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:35,790
You have my word.

653
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:37,750
Okay.

654
00:32:53,625 --> 00:32:54,625
Ready when you are.

655
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:00,460
Mm-hmm. I'll grab you a sweater.

656
00:33:02,041 --> 00:33:04,171
I'm sorry Julien didn't
tell you about me.

657
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:05,916
I am too.

658
00:33:07,791 --> 00:33:08,921
Not surprised, though.

659
00:33:10,458 --> 00:33:11,538
I shouldn't...

660
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,460
I shouldn't say that.
You're her sister.

661
00:33:14,916 --> 00:33:16,626
I am, but,

662
00:33:16,708 --> 00:33:19,168
God, even I barely know her.

663
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:22,250
Sometimes it's just feels like
we're not even dating anymore.

664
00:33:23,541 --> 00:33:25,711
Really, you know, like I'm just

665
00:33:25,791 --> 00:33:30,171
this actor, and I'm playing
her boyfriend in her story.

666
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:32,130
When we first got
together though, it was

667
00:33:32,833 --> 00:33:33,833
totally different.

668
00:33:33,916 --> 00:33:35,916
That was way before she
got into any of that stuff.

669
00:33:38,666 --> 00:33:40,376
And we were interested
in the same things,

670
00:33:40,458 --> 00:33:42,078
she wanted to make
her mark on the world.

671
00:33:44,291 --> 00:33:47,371
And now she just, like, tells me what
to wear and where to be and what to say.

672
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:51,130
She's making her mark, for
sure. Don't get me wrong.

673
00:33:51,208 --> 00:33:53,708
I mean, she's got
a lot of influence.

674
00:33:55,666 --> 00:33:56,916
You know, it's just it's

675
00:33:58,333 --> 00:33:59,413
it's her world, it's not

676
00:34:00,416 --> 00:34:01,536
it's not ours.

677
00:34:05,208 --> 00:34:06,208
Okay.

678
00:34:07,333 --> 00:34:09,543
Two years ago, on my birthday.

679
00:34:10,458 --> 00:34:12,918
I got this DM from
someone who...

680
00:34:13,708 --> 00:34:15,828
- I'd only ever heard of.
- Mm-hmm.

681
00:34:15,916 --> 00:34:20,326
She'd been mythical to me, and
then suddenly, she was real.

682
00:34:20,416 --> 00:34:23,416
We DM'd and talked pretty much
every single day since then.

683
00:34:24,208 --> 00:34:25,668
The Julien that I got to know

684
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:27,250
on the other end of
those phone calls?

685
00:34:29,041 --> 00:34:32,291
Yeah, she's different from
the one that I met today.

686
00:34:32,375 --> 00:34:33,785
More like the one you miss.

687
00:34:35,875 --> 00:34:37,285
Which means she's
still in there.

688
00:34:42,583 --> 00:34:43,883
What?

689
00:34:43,958 --> 00:34:44,998
It's just, uh,

690
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:47,173
it's nice to hear someone
be kind for a change.

691
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:51,420
It's nice to feel
kindness for a change.

692
00:34:57,541 --> 00:34:59,631
Well, um

693
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:01,250
the rain has stopped.

694
00:35:01,333 --> 00:35:03,883
You should probably get your
dress before it shrinks.

695
00:35:03,958 --> 00:35:05,168
- Mm-hmm.
- Yup.

696
00:35:10,708 --> 00:35:13,668
The only time I felt more gross
than standing here showing you these

697
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:15,500
is the moment that I
took them to show you!

698
00:35:15,583 --> 00:35:17,673
I should be arrested.

699
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:20,170
They were standing
in front of a window.

700
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:23,830
- Anyone could have seen that.
- Anyone didn't. I did.

701
00:35:23,916 --> 00:35:26,376
- You won't use these, right?
- I don't want to.

702
00:35:27,541 --> 00:35:28,541
But

703
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:32,330
we're either in
this or we're not.

704
00:35:51,666 --> 00:35:53,101
- Whatever you may have read...
- Not even 9:00.

705
00:35:53,125 --> 00:35:55,415
I'm so glad I can
always trust you.

706
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,420
<i> Ah, New York.</i>

707
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:42,540
<i>Is there anything more romantic
than a walk in the fall rain?</i>

708
00:36:42,625 --> 00:36:45,375
<i>Only what happens after
behind closed doors.</i>

709
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:47,378
<i>Or open windows.</i>

710
00:36:47,458 --> 00:36:52,958
<i>Hey JC, looks like DNA isn't
all you and your sister share.</i>

711
00:36:53,041 --> 00:36:55,581
- Julien, it's not true.
- Of course it isn't.

712
00:36:55,666 --> 00:36:57,976
<i>He just gave me a place
to wait till the rain stopped.</i>

713
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,184
What is this Gossip Girl thing
and why is it out to get us?

714
00:37:00,208 --> 00:37:02,578
They're after me.
You're just collateral.

715
00:37:02,666 --> 00:37:05,576
But whoever it is, I
won't let them win.

716
00:37:08,041 --> 00:37:08,751
Did we go about
this the wrong way?

717
00:37:08,833 --> 00:37:10,083
Not telling anyone?

718
00:37:10,166 --> 00:37:11,996
You have to be
strategic about the way

719
00:37:12,083 --> 00:37:14,963
that you present
things to the world.

720
00:37:15,041 --> 00:37:16,961
We just weren't careful enough.

721
00:37:17,041 --> 00:37:18,921
<i>We'll tell everyone
some jealous freshman</i>

722
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,960
<i>is trying to stir
shit between us.</i>

723
00:37:21,041 --> 00:37:22,161
<i>But there's no shit to stir.</i>

724
00:37:22,708 --> 00:37:23,918
It'll all blow over

725
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,750
if we just show that
it hasn't gotten to us.

726
00:37:28,125 --> 00:37:29,226
I'll see you in the courtyard.

727
00:37:43,416 --> 00:37:45,956
Hey, look,
there he is. The cheater.

728
00:37:46,041 --> 00:37:49,211
With a freshman?
That's so gross, Obie.

729
00:37:49,291 --> 00:37:50,711
Yeah, keep walking.

730
00:37:50,791 --> 00:37:53,501
I can't believe
he did that. Freak, man.

731
00:37:53,583 --> 00:37:55,293
Why would you ever
cheat on Julien?

732
00:37:55,375 --> 00:37:57,875
- I didn't.
- Oh, so Gossip Girl's lying?

733
00:37:57,958 --> 00:37:59,918
Of course he'd say that.

734
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,170
Dude, I've been defending
your honor all morning,

735
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:02,830
as if it was<i> The Crucible.</i>

736
00:38:02,916 --> 00:38:05,826
Gotta say, not the best optics,

737
00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:08,416
- your girlfriend's sister.
- I didn't do anything, Ak.

738
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:11,710
All right? You know I would
never do anything like that.

739
00:38:11,791 --> 00:38:13,381
It's just

740
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:15,267
- some crazy kind of...
- Social media nightmare!

741
00:38:15,291 --> 00:38:18,251
You as someone who loses
is bad for business.

742
00:38:19,166 --> 00:38:20,206
I didn't lose anything.

743
00:38:20,291 --> 00:38:22,381
And everything will be
fine so long as you win.

744
00:38:22,458 --> 00:38:26,208
Olivia Jade gained followers
when her mom went to jail.

745
00:38:26,291 --> 00:38:27,751
Exactly, her mom went to jail.

746
00:38:27,833 --> 00:38:30,673
For Jules to rise above this,
she has to destroy Zoya.

747
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:34,460
Ladies, ladies, nobody's
gonna believe that gossip.

748
00:38:34,541 --> 00:38:36,211
Zoya's a 14-year-old
nobody, and I'm me.

749
00:38:40,416 --> 00:38:42,376
First she stole her mom,
then she stole her man.

750
00:38:44,458 --> 00:38:45,918
If you want to
get back at Zobie,

751
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,630
I volunteer as tribute.

752
00:38:48,708 --> 00:38:50,748
Oh my God, they're
already a hashtag.

753
00:38:50,833 --> 00:38:52,753
- You need to do something.
- This shit ain't it.

754
00:39:03,458 --> 00:39:05,628
I got us a regular Lyft,
we can talk in here.

755
00:39:05,708 --> 00:39:08,378
- Julien, I'm so, so sorry.
- It's not your fault.

756
00:39:08,458 --> 00:39:09,288
I feel terrible anyway.

757
00:39:09,375 --> 00:39:11,625
I'm just so confused
about everything.

758
00:39:11,708 --> 00:39:13,351
The whole school was
either staring me down

759
00:39:13,375 --> 00:39:14,705
or high fiving me all day.

760
00:39:14,791 --> 00:39:17,541
I've come up with a plan
to get us past this.

761
00:39:17,625 --> 00:39:19,625
I did a little research
on Gossip Girl.

762
00:39:19,708 --> 00:39:20,851
There were these
two best friends

763
00:39:20,875 --> 00:39:22,495
she was obsessed
with forever ago.

764
00:39:22,583 --> 00:39:24,633
It's kind of a badge of
honor that she chose us.

765
00:39:25,875 --> 00:39:27,035
All we have to do

766
00:39:27,125 --> 00:39:29,285
is take a page from the
Blair and Serena playbook,

767
00:39:29,375 --> 00:39:31,625
and beat Gossip Girl
at her own game.

768
00:39:31,708 --> 00:39:33,418
How do you beat an
anonymous troll?

769
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,460
Since no one believes
the truth, only the lie,

770
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:38,791
we have to lie in return.

771
00:39:38,875 --> 00:39:41,075
We plan a public
showdown, nothing too big,

772
00:39:41,166 --> 00:39:42,996
just where I look like
I get the power back.

773
00:39:43,083 --> 00:39:45,713
And then everything can go
back to the way that it was.

774
00:39:45,791 --> 00:39:48,421
Us, as the sisters
we're meant to be.

775
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,460
How do you get the power back?

776
00:39:50,541 --> 00:39:52,642
<i>I'm walking in the
Christopher John Rogers show</i>

777
00:39:52,666 --> 00:39:54,206
<i>tomorrow at the Armory.</i>

778
00:39:54,291 --> 00:39:56,131
<i>It's a big deal for
my brand identity.</i>

779
00:39:56,208 --> 00:39:57,684
<i>And I'll make sure
that you have a seat.</i>

780
00:39:57,708 --> 00:40:01,578
<i>But I'll forget to put you on
the list for the after-party.</i>

781
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:04,133
<i>And all you have to do is</i>

782
00:40:04,208 --> 00:40:06,418
<i>make a scene when
they don't let you in.</i>

783
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:10,000
<i>Monet and Luna will take a
photo of Obie and I inside,</i>

784
00:40:10,083 --> 00:40:13,293
<i>with your meltdown outside.</i>

785
00:40:13,375 --> 00:40:15,665
<i>You really think Obie's
gonna go along with this?</i>

786
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:18,420
<i>He does things for
me. He's good like that.</i>

787
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,790
But you should stay away
from him for the time being.

788
00:40:20,875 --> 00:40:22,875
And we should stay out of
each other's way as well.

789
00:40:23,333 --> 00:40:25,083
Just till the show.

790
00:40:25,166 --> 00:40:27,916
Build the tension, you know.
Tease it, like Gossip Girl did.

791
00:40:28,625 --> 00:40:29,825
Speaking of that devil.

792
00:40:31,375 --> 00:40:33,915
- What are you doing?
<i> Tossing out the bait.</i>

793
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,160
<i>You might have
noticed it's been all quiet</i>

794
00:40:36,208 --> 00:40:39,288
<i>on the Upper Eastern front
for the past 24 hours.</i>

795
00:40:39,375 --> 00:40:42,785
<i>Think the storm has
passed? Not a chance.</i>

796
00:40:42,875 --> 00:40:46,125
<i>Sources tell us to keep your
eyes peeled at the Armory.</i>

797
00:40:46,208 --> 00:40:48,788
<i>Who doesn't love a
fashion showdown?</i>

798
00:40:48,875 --> 00:40:49,995
I tried to warn her.

799
00:40:50,083 --> 00:40:52,083
I mean, our group of friends

800
00:40:52,166 --> 00:40:53,916
have known each other
since we were babies.

801
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,500
We have trust
and... and history.

802
00:40:56,583 --> 00:40:59,293
So no new friends, ever?

803
00:40:59,375 --> 00:41:00,684
I'm not saying
pull up the drawbridge.

804
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:04,078
I just think it is so terribly
odd that she lied about it.

805
00:41:04,166 --> 00:41:05,996
Well, it's Julien's life.

806
00:41:06,083 --> 00:41:08,883
I mean, whatever reasons
she had made sense to her.

807
00:41:08,958 --> 00:41:12,708
I didn't book a session,
Dr. Menzies, please.

808
00:41:12,791 --> 00:41:15,541
Hey, it's just... share in
my outrage for one moment.

809
00:41:15,625 --> 00:41:18,625
This whole thing is ridiculous.
Okay, however it came to be,

810
00:41:18,708 --> 00:41:20,418
secret sisters fighting
over Prince George

811
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:24,670
is as<i> déclassé</i> as
an Andy Cohen show.

812
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:26,880
It's time to ice out
that social climber.

813
00:41:27,916 --> 00:41:29,496
Are you guys still
in that text chain?

814
00:41:29,583 --> 00:41:30,583
Yes.

815
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:32,630
Thank you. Thank you.

816
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:34,880
Where's your dad's
concealer again?

817
00:41:34,958 --> 00:41:37,128
Top right drawer.

818
00:41:38,666 --> 00:41:39,916
All right.

819
00:41:43,583 --> 00:41:46,673
- Here we go.
- No, no, no, not for me.

820
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:49,380
Sies Marjan was for
everybody, so...

821
00:41:49,458 --> 00:41:52,498
Yeah, if you're in, like,
a Gaspar Noé movie maybe,

822
00:41:52,583 --> 00:41:54,133
but I don't like to stick out.

823
00:41:55,083 --> 00:41:57,213
Well, you already do, so...

824
00:42:02,625 --> 00:42:03,625
Where you going?

825
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:06,420
Mirror's here.

826
00:42:56,708 --> 00:42:59,788
Julien? I've had my eye on you.

827
00:42:59,875 --> 00:43:02,915
- Looking forward to it.
- Thank you, Lindsay.

828
00:43:07,791 --> 00:43:10,001
Have you been reading the
comments on this post?

829
00:43:10,083 --> 00:43:12,173
People are expecting you
to go full Cersei tonight,

830
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:13,830
but your plan is Saoirse.

831
00:43:13,916 --> 00:43:15,746
What part of "destroy"
did you not understand?

832
00:43:16,125 --> 00:43:17,165
I agree.

833
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:19,580
Leaving someone off a guest
list is for bat mitzvahs.

834
00:43:19,666 --> 00:43:21,184
- She's my sister. I'm not...
- You think just 'cause you're related to her,

835
00:43:21,208 --> 00:43:23,668
she doesn't have it out for you?

836
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:27,460
Ever heard of Shakespeare?
<i>Succession?</i> The Bible?

837
00:43:27,541 --> 00:43:30,251
Fam v fam's the number one
story since the dawn of dawn.

838
00:43:30,333 --> 00:43:30,963
She worked you.

839
00:43:31,041 --> 00:43:33,211
She just wanted in.

840
00:43:33,291 --> 00:43:35,291
- It's not like...
- You're losing followers, okay?

841
00:43:35,708 --> 00:43:36,998
She's getting them.

842
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:43,460
Finally.

843
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:50,168
What's the plan?

844
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:53,540
Well, the world thinks Z is
out to snatch whatever JC has.

845
00:43:53,625 --> 00:43:54,745
So we'll follow that thread.

846
00:43:54,791 --> 00:43:58,041
We'll make it seem like she
planned some big secret sabotage

847
00:43:58,125 --> 00:43:59,535
to ruin Jules's big moment.

848
00:43:59,625 --> 00:44:01,325
And then when that
plan goes off,

849
00:44:01,416 --> 00:44:03,576
we'll be there to point
out the person who did it.

850
00:44:03,666 --> 00:44:06,496
She'll be so humiliated in front
of the only people that matter

851
00:44:06,583 --> 00:44:09,543
that she'll never want to show
her face outside of school again.

852
00:44:09,625 --> 00:44:11,495
Mm, I love us.

853
00:44:12,333 --> 00:44:13,833
When did she say
it would go down?

854
00:44:13,916 --> 00:44:16,996
The after-party. So,
um, we have time.

855
00:44:18,125 --> 00:44:20,165
I want to see the show, so...

856
00:44:32,083 --> 00:44:33,642
- Love that.

857
00:44:40,541 --> 00:44:43,081
Don't you know? You can't
use your phone in here.

858
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,184
If someone sees you,
you'll get thrown out,

859
00:44:46,208 --> 00:44:49,958
and then you wouldn't be able to
help your sister with her plan.

860
00:44:50,041 --> 00:44:52,121
- I'm sorry, I didn't know.
- Okay. Well, now you do.

861
00:44:52,166 --> 00:44:53,166
Your seat's over there.

862
00:44:56,083 --> 00:44:59,003
Wait. I need you.

863
00:44:59,083 --> 00:45:00,833
Well, part of you.

864
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:12,375
Hurry. Go, go, go.

865
00:45:14,583 --> 00:45:16,173
Hurry, we
don't have time.

866
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:17,830
What? You're the
stylist. Style me.

867
00:46:01,291 --> 00:46:02,751
- Ooh.
- Right?

868
00:46:08,333 --> 00:46:10,673
That tracks.

869
00:46:49,250 --> 00:46:51,392
Here she comes.
- How do you know this'll work?

870
00:46:51,416 --> 00:46:53,126
Just like you don't
need someone's password

871
00:46:53,208 --> 00:46:55,578
to take a photo, you don't
need one to share it.

872
00:47:14,291 --> 00:47:16,461
Ew!

873
00:47:22,291 --> 00:47:24,711
What
the hell? Who sent this?

874
00:47:24,791 --> 00:47:27,381
Ew, ew!
Oh, not bad.

875
00:47:27,458 --> 00:47:29,098
Anybody recognize them?

876
00:47:29,166 --> 00:47:31,206
Security! Over here.

877
00:47:31,291 --> 00:47:33,421
- Hi.
- You saw that photo, right?

878
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:34,250
Yeah, we saw who sent it.

879
00:47:34,333 --> 00:47:35,963
It's the girl in
that orange dress.

880
00:47:48,166 --> 00:47:50,126
Come
with us, please, right now.

881
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,630
Sorry, what? What's going on?

882
00:47:52,708 --> 00:47:54,378
Just follow me.

883
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:56,500
It was her!

884
00:47:56,583 --> 00:47:58,517
See, right
there! She's the one who sent it!

885
00:47:58,541 --> 00:48:00,017
That's who sent it? Her?

886
00:48:07,083 --> 00:48:08,213
You dropped your phone.

887
00:48:10,708 --> 00:48:12,668
This isn't
the after-party.

888
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:13,750
Did we get played?

889
00:48:29,708 --> 00:48:32,788
- What are you doing?
- Cementing us.

890
00:48:32,875 --> 00:48:36,455
<i> Spotted: Some Upper
East Side style sibling rivalry.</i>

891
00:48:36,541 --> 00:48:39,291
<i>It may look like Z was
trying to steal the light,</i>

892
00:48:39,375 --> 00:48:41,875
<i>but she was unaware of
Julien and her callow ways.</i>

893
00:48:41,958 --> 00:48:45,788
<i>It's a long drop
from A-list to Z,</i>

894
00:48:45,875 --> 00:48:47,517
<i>but at least everything is
back where it's meant to be.</i>

895
00:48:47,541 --> 00:48:49,881
She looks triumphant.

896
00:48:50,750 --> 00:48:51,750
Oh my God!

897
00:48:54,333 --> 00:48:56,463
What?

898
00:49:02,333 --> 00:49:04,503
<i>Still,
I'd watch out, JC.</i>

899
00:49:04,583 --> 00:49:08,633
<i>You bought what you needed,
but now, you'll pay the price.</i>

900
00:49:15,666 --> 00:49:19,576
- Julien?
- Oh. Good, you're here.

901
00:49:19,666 --> 00:49:22,036
I had no idea Monet and
Luna were gonna do that.

902
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:24,125
Why didn't you stop
it when it happened?

903
00:49:24,791 --> 00:49:26,081
You stood there.

904
00:49:26,166 --> 00:49:28,666
Worse... you liked it.

905
00:49:28,750 --> 00:49:30,920
- No, I didn't. Z...
- You don't get to call me that.

906
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,290
My God, you're really blowing
this out of proportion.

907
00:49:34,375 --> 00:49:35,375
I'm hurt.

908
00:49:36,375 --> 00:49:37,575
You hurt me.

909
00:49:44,250 --> 00:49:45,267
Why did you bring me here?

910
00:49:45,291 --> 00:49:47,501
- You're my sister.
- We don't even know each other.

911
00:49:47,583 --> 00:49:50,213
Mom wanted us to.

912
00:49:50,291 --> 00:49:53,541
She left us a clue to make sure.
Julien Elizabeth, Zoya Jane.

913
00:49:53,625 --> 00:49:55,875
So don't let some petty
high school bullshit

914
00:49:55,958 --> 00:49:57,418
change what we planned.

915
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:59,184
I've spent my whole life
wondering who Mom was.

916
00:49:59,208 --> 00:50:03,578
What she was really like.
Why I never got to know her.

917
00:50:03,666 --> 00:50:05,146
And the only thing
that made it better

918
00:50:05,208 --> 00:50:07,328
when I got so low
was knowing that

919
00:50:07,416 --> 00:50:09,376
there was somebody else
wondering the same things.

920
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:13,670
But you don't even care
about that, do you?

921
00:50:15,083 --> 00:50:16,843
You only care about how
other people see you.

922
00:50:17,708 --> 00:50:18,708
You just got here.

923
00:50:19,666 --> 00:50:20,576
You have no idea how hard it was

924
00:50:20,666 --> 00:50:23,666
for me to become who I am today.

925
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:25,630
Dead mom, drunk or
disappearing dad.

926
00:50:25,708 --> 00:50:27,918
And now I'm not just
known, I'm influential.

927
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,540
It takes a lot of work
to matter like that,

928
00:50:30,625 --> 00:50:31,455
to become something.

929
00:50:31,541 --> 00:50:32,767
And I can't have that
taken away from me.

930
00:50:32,791 --> 00:50:35,001
You don't know who
I was before this.

931
00:50:36,791 --> 00:50:39,751
I had a life in
Buffalo. Friends.

932
00:50:39,833 --> 00:50:42,923
I pushed my dad to move here
because you asked me to.

933
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,790
Because you said you
wanted to be the family

934
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:45,955
we were meant to be.

935
00:50:48,208 --> 00:50:49,208
I wish I never came.

936
00:50:49,958 --> 00:50:51,998
Well, maybe you shouldn't have.

937
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:55,540
But you're here now, so
this can go one of two ways.

938
00:50:59,125 --> 00:51:00,165
You can learn me,

939
00:51:01,916 --> 00:51:02,996
or you can leave.

940
00:51:05,625 --> 00:51:07,415
I've learned enough.

941
00:51:08,875 --> 00:51:11,165
But I'm not gonna leave either.

942
00:51:11,250 --> 00:51:13,580
There's room for more
than just you to matter.

943
00:51:16,041 --> 00:51:18,421
Do you really think you can
go up against me and win?

944
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:21,420
See,
that's your problem.

945
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:23,250
You still think there's
something to win.

946
00:51:24,583 --> 00:51:26,293
But I'm not playing your game.

947
00:51:26,375 --> 00:51:28,035
So its outcome
means nothing to me.

948
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:32,580
That's right. How
could I forget?

949
00:51:32,666 --> 00:51:34,206
People like you don't
win. They steal.

950
00:51:36,083 --> 00:51:37,253
Just like your dad did.

951
00:51:38,416 --> 00:51:39,746
So

952
00:51:39,833 --> 00:51:41,463
Good luck, Z.

953
00:51:48,875 --> 00:51:51,375
Great, now we can go
to The Blond together.

954
00:51:58,541 --> 00:52:00,671
Babe?

955
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:02,210
What you did back there...

956
00:52:03,041 --> 00:52:05,001
I didn't do anything.

957
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:09,538
I've been waiting a long

958
00:52:10,750 --> 00:52:12,210
long time for this.

959
00:52:14,375 --> 00:52:15,745
For what?

960
00:52:15,833 --> 00:52:17,433
For you to show
who you really are.

961
00:52:18,208 --> 00:52:19,248
I mean, I feel like...

962
00:52:20,458 --> 00:52:21,498
I feel like an idiot

963
00:52:21,583 --> 00:52:23,663
for thinking that you were
ever somebody I could I...

964
00:52:25,750 --> 00:52:27,390
I let it get too far
tonight. I know that.

965
00:52:28,875 --> 00:52:31,245
But I'll do better, I promise.

966
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:36,630
Yeah, maybe.

967
00:52:39,291 --> 00:52:41,581
Maybe you will, but I
won't be there when you do.

968
00:52:41,666 --> 00:52:43,059
I'm... I'm done.
Sir, can you just...

969
00:52:43,083 --> 00:52:45,323
- I'm gonna get out right here.
- Obie! You can't just...

970
00:53:08,333 --> 00:53:09,463
I can explain.

971
00:53:10,208 --> 00:53:11,248
You don't have to.

972
00:53:13,833 --> 00:53:15,433
You and your sister
have committed fraud.

973
00:53:17,083 --> 00:53:18,713
You could get thrown
out of that school.

974
00:53:18,791 --> 00:53:20,951
- This could go on your record.
- No, it won't. I'll...

975
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,670
I'll tell them that I had no idea
Julien got me the scholarship.

976
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:26,380
- You mean you'll lie?
- I had no idea, Dad. Really.

977
00:53:27,875 --> 00:53:31,825
And... I would have
gotten it anyway, right?

978
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:40,960
Now you'll never know.

979
00:53:51,416 --> 00:53:54,416
<i>We started
off painting on cave walls.</i>

980
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:59,460
<i>Representations of what we
saw and knew to be true.</i>

981
00:53:59,541 --> 00:54:02,631
<i>That bear, the sun, ourselves.</i>

982
00:54:02,708 --> 00:54:04,788
I'm sorry it's
taking me so long.

983
00:54:11,333 --> 00:54:12,963
You know you can think
about him, right?

984
00:54:15,083 --> 00:54:16,083
What?

985
00:54:20,833 --> 00:54:22,293
<i> But very soon,</i>

986
00:54:22,375 --> 00:54:26,625
<i>facts of family and
fire turned into fables.</i>

987
00:54:27,291 --> 00:54:28,291
<i>That bear, vanquished.</i>

988
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,540
<i>The sun, a god.</i>

989
00:54:32,625 --> 00:54:36,495
<i>And us? Anything
we wanted to be.</i>

990
00:54:38,125 --> 00:54:39,955
<i>And
we've never gone back.</i>

991
00:54:42,375 --> 00:54:45,625
<i>There's a reason we
call the act of relating something,</i>

992
00:54:45,708 --> 00:54:47,578
<i>"telling a story."</i>

993
00:54:47,666 --> 00:54:50,036
<i>We say it even when it's true.</i>

994
00:54:50,125 --> 00:54:52,825
<i>We also say it when it's a lie.</i>

995
00:54:55,791 --> 00:54:58,171
<i>"Ooh, have I got
a story for you."</i>

996
00:54:58,250 --> 00:55:01,380
<i>"Do you wanna hear
something crazy?"</i>

997
00:55:01,458 --> 00:55:04,628
<i>"You will not believe what
I'm about to tell you."</i>

998
00:55:07,291 --> 00:55:10,001
<i>Which is
how we got to today.</i>

999
00:55:10,083 --> 00:55:14,043
<i>It's all a story now.
And we love to tell it.</i>

1000
00:55:14,125 --> 00:55:15,267
<i>It doesn't matter if it's real.</i>

1001
00:55:15,291 --> 00:55:18,171
<i>It doesn't matter if
it happened to you</i>

1002
00:55:18,250 --> 00:55:19,580
<i>or if you did it.</i>

1003
00:55:19,666 --> 00:55:22,576
<i>It only matters
if I say you did.</i>

1004
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,309
<i>Because what they
realized then is still true now.</i>

1005
00:55:26,333 --> 00:55:30,293
<i>The only thing that
makes a story interesting</i>

1006
00:55:30,375 --> 00:55:33,535
<i>is how it's told and
who's telling it.</i>

1007
00:55:37,041 --> 00:55:38,041
Those shoes are cool.

1008
00:55:41,416 --> 00:55:42,826
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

1009
00:55:42,916 --> 00:55:46,166
Uh, are you still going to
the RTC Alliance after school?

1010
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:50,580
I am still going to the RTC
Alliance after school, yeah.

1011
00:55:50,666 --> 00:55:52,246
I... I would really
love to join you.

1012
00:55:55,875 --> 00:55:57,495
I would love for
you to join me too.

1013
00:56:03,458 --> 00:56:07,128
- Oh.
- I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

1014
00:56:07,208 --> 00:56:09,288
It's all my fault, not yours.

1015
00:56:15,208 --> 00:56:16,288
I like your blazer.

1016
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,210
Thank you.

1017
00:56:22,166 --> 00:56:23,626
I'll see you in class.

1018
00:56:30,625 --> 00:56:33,165
<i>I told you
you couldn't hide from me.</i>

1019
00:56:33,250 --> 00:56:35,290
<i>I told you I saw you.</i>

1020
00:56:37,208 --> 00:56:40,168
<i>But if there's
one thing you can hold as true,</i>

1021
00:56:40,250 --> 00:56:42,880
<i>then as now, it's this.</i>

1022
00:56:42,958 --> 00:56:46,248
<i>It may take some time,
it may hurt a little bit,</i>

1023
00:56:46,333 --> 00:56:49,753
<i>but I know you'll love me.</i>

1024
00:56:49,833 --> 00:56:52,293
Which one of these
should we post next?

1025
00:56:52,375 --> 00:56:55,875
Whichever we want. The
future is ours again.

1026
00:56:57,541 --> 00:57:00,421
<i> XOXO, Gossip Girl.</i>
