00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:23,580
Lions are the very image of majesty.

3
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,700
And, indeed, of Africa itself.

4
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:37,458
Their strength lies
in the power of the pride,

5
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:39,340
their tight-knit family.

6
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:47,778
Lions have ruled the savannahs for
millennia.

7
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:51,098
And yet, within the last 20 years
or so,

8
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:54,260
their numbers have fallen by almost
half.

10
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:08,778
Our team has spent two years
following perhaps the most famous

11
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:13,260
lion family of all, the Marsh pride
of Kenya's Masai Mara.

12
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:19,458
As we join them, the very survival
of this great dynasty

13
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:20,900
is under threat.

14
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:42,418
Their future depends entirely
on the strength and determination

15
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:44,900
of one extraordinary leader.

16
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:52,380
Perhaps the most powerful
in the history of the Marsh pride.

17
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:07,380
A lioness known as Charm.

18
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,900
The Masai Mara.

19
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:40,898
The pride have always thrived
here through an alliance

20
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:44,978
between powerful alpha males
to protect the family

21
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:48,740
and experienced females
to raise the cubs.

22
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:54,938
But, for the first time
in the pride's history,

23
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:58,020
this alliance has been shattered.

24
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:03,340
The family has been abandoned
by all the adult males.

25
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:15,018
The survival of the pride now rests
upon the shoulders of Charm

26
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,900
and her cousin, Sienna.

27
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:20,300
The only remaining adults.

28
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:31,698
If their young are to reach
adulthood and the dynasty return

29
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:37,260
to full strength, they must now both
protect and feed the whole family.

30
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,180
August.

31
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:00,660
Following the recent rains,
it's a time of plenty.

32
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:11,218
The lions are surrounded by
wildebeest

33
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,340
on their annual migration.

34
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:22,258
A quarter-tonne bull would make
a good meal

35
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,460
for all ten of the pride.

36
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:38,018
But even though Charm
is an experienced hunter,

37
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:40,500
most attempts end in failure.

38
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:13,900
Charm uses her hind legs to knock
the wildebeest off-balance.

39
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:14,658
The smallest cubs won't be able
to catch food for themselves

40
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:16,340
for another 12 months.

41
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:22,458
Their ever-growing appetites mean
that Charm and Sienna

42
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:25,020
have to hunt around the clock.

43
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:33,740
The females are often
forced to head out alone.

44
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:38,300
Tonight, it's Sienna's turn.

45
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,380
Sunrise.

46
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:56,020
Sienna is seriously injured.

47
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,900
She's too week to move.

48
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:10,818
A lone lion is always at risk
of attack by buffalo,

49
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:14,660
hyenas, even other lion prides.

50
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:50,740
It's evening, and Sienna hasn't
returned to her family.

51
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:58,540
Now, everything depends on Charm.

52
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:20,498
As night falls, Charm has no choice
but to head out to hunt,

53
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,140
leaving the vulnerable cubs alone.

54
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,980
She's being trailed.

55
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,420
Hyenas.

56
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:01,978
They'll attack lone lions
if they get the chance,

57
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:04,020
to steal any kill they make.

58
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:17,460
Charm must work fast
before they find her.

59
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:42,058
They've tracked her down.

60
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:49,620
On her own, she couldn't hold them
off.

61
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,980
But another of the pride has been
following Charm.

62
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,660
Her three-year-old daughter, Yaya.

63
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:30,618
The rest of the pride arrive.

64
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:32,100
To eat.

65
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:40,700
Yaya has stepped up to help defend
the pride and feed her family.

66
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:58,178
Daughters stay with their mothers
for life, and may eventually

67
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,980
have cubs of their own.

68
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:07,738
Yaya is not yet an adult,
but as Charm's eldest daughter,

69
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:10,900
she's next in line
to lead the pride.

70
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:21,220
Charm also has a three-year-old son,
Tatu.

71
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:25,618
The beginnings of an impressive
mane are a sign

72
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:28,140
of his approaching adulthood.

73
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:42,498
Like every adolescent,
Tatu can't resist the chance

74
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,580
to test his growing strength.

75
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:00,460
Even against a two-tonne hippo.

76
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:12,220
But he's not the only
young male in this pride.

77
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,860
His cousin, Red.

78
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:30,218
Over the last few months,
the two of them have begun

79
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,980
to forge an alliance.

80
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:38,658
But even together, they're not
really going to worry

81
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:39,820
an angry hippo.

82
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:50,538
Unlike their sisters,
sons always leave their family

83
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:52,620
when they reach adulthood.

84
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:02,740
Their growing bond may enable them
to leave as a powerful partnership.

85
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:11,858
Eventually, they'll fight other
males to try and take over a pride

86
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,260
of their own.

87
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:22,418
But for the time being,
they still need Charm

88
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:23,940
to look after them.

89
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:44,580
It's been four days since
Sienna was attacked.

90
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:49,538
She's back on her feet.

91
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:51,860
But she's in urgent need of a meal.

92
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:12,220
She simply doesn't
have the strength.

93
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:36,698
As they mature, young males begin
to explore the boundaries

94
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,500
of the pride's territory.

95
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:46,700
Red has ventured out alone.

96
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:05,498
And blundered straight
into the middle of the hyena clan.

97
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,780
He's trapped by over 20 of them.

98
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:51,540
The pack tries to wear him down.

99
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:55,100
This number of hyenas
could kill him.

100
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:24,420
It's impossible to fight
them all at once.

101
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:42,458
He can't keep them at bay for much
longer.

102
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,260
He's tiring fast.

103
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:57,100
His ally, Tatu,
has heard the commotion.

104
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:20,340
Now, the odds have changed.

105
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:31,538
Even for 20 hyenas,
a pair of male lions

106
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:33,700
is too much to take on.

107
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,980
Red is lucky.

108
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:57,100
Tatu has saved his cousin's life.

109
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:44,938
After weeks of feeding on scraps,
Sienna has grown strong enough

110
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:47,580
to try and rejoin her family.

111
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:08,060
She greets Charm first.

112
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:13,938
Even after being apart for so long,
the bond between them

113
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,500
is still strong.

114
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:39,620
Yaya also welcomes Sienna
back into the pride.

115
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:11,500
At last, Charm's family
are back together.

116
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:31,098
Charm not only has her hunting
partner back,

117
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:34,380
but another hunter is emerging.

118
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:40,100
Yaya is becoming a powerful lioness.

119
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,940
She's learned how to stalk.

120
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,820
Stay low.

121
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:17,580
Approach silently.

122
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,740
And from downwind.

123
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:29,180
But the key to a successful ambush
is not being noticed.

124
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:42,458
Now it's seen her, the wildebeest,
with its sharp horns,

125
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:44,060
has the advantage.

126
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,700
But Yaya is learning.

127
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:14,980
Mother and daughter are starting
to develop their partnership.

128
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:40,058
It's October.

129
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:44,458
The great wildebeest
migration never stops.

130
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:47,380
And now, they're leaving
the Masai Mara.

131
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:12,098
For Charm and her family,
food is about to become

132
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:14,340
much more difficult to find.

133
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:53,218
The plains are now empty.

134
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:55,258
And, in search of food,

135
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:59,060
Charm leads the pride to the edge of
their range.

136
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:05,220
Here, she finds another kind of
prey.

137
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:12,540
Cattle, illegally brought into the
lions' territory to graze.

138
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:20,180
An opportunity to feed her hungry
family.

139
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:27,260
But hunting cattle
can lead to disaster.

140
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:37,818
To protect their livestock,

141
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:40,900
herdsmen sometimes put out poisoned
bait.

142
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:01,180
Lions can't tell
when a meal is toxic.

143
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:08,980
A week later, Charm's one-year-old
son is so ill he can hardly stand.

144
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:21,780
The whole pride are showing
the signs of poisoning.

145
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:27,260
And Sienna is missing once again.

146
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:37,980
As the temperature climbs,
the pride heads off to find shade.

147
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:43,140
But the struggling cub
is too weak to follow.

148
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:59,540
Charm needs to stay
with the rest of the pride.

149
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:36,500
Hours later, the cub still hasn't
caught up with his mother.

150
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:43,380
And there's no sign
of Sienna, either.

151
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:22,860
The next day, Charm
returns to her son's side.

152
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:44,900
He's still very unsteady.

153
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:58,300
But his mother can't abandon
the rest of the pride.

154
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:16,940
For the sake of the pride,
Charm abandons her young cub.

155
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:39,820
The others are waiting for her.

156
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:49,620
They need her now more than ever.

157
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:29,980
She will never see her son,
or Sienna, alive again.

158
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:59,698
Despite her losses,
there may still be a future

159
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,580
for Charm and her dynasty.

160
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:09,660
Her eldest cubs, Yaya and Tatu,
have survived the poisoning.

161
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:45,020
Charm keeps the pride moving
in a constant search for prey.

162
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:07,700
Catching enough food is hard,
even with Yaya's help.

163
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:21,100
But Charm is relentless.

164
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:41,780
The younger members of the pride
try to follow her example.

165
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:02,578
Even with little to hunt
and the constant harassment

166
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:07,018
of hyenas, Charm's skill
and experience as a leader

167
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:09,180
is keeping the pride alive.

168
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:22,860
A few weeks later,
her efforts begin to be rewarded.

169
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:31,818
Tatu and Red are now
over four years old,

170
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:35,380
ready to take the final
step to adulthood.

171
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:44,940
It's time for them
to leave the pride.

172
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:10,420
For Charm, this is success.

173
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:18,538
They head out as a partnership,
to battle other males,

174
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:22,258
to win a pride of their own,

175
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:25,660
and continue the family's bloodline
elsewhere.

176
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:35,138
But Charm still needs to get
the remaining four female cubs

177
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:37,020
safely to adulthood.

178
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:04,138
One early morning in May...

179
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:07,980
...the roar of adult male lions.

180
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:20,938
Two new males, outsiders,
are searching for a pride

181
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:22,940
to take over as their own.

182
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:40,538
New males could bring the
possibility

183
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:42,780
of a new generation of cubs.

184
00:36:56,820 --> 00:37:01,300
But they could just as
easily bring disaster.

185
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:21,818
Soon, the new males begin
to impose their authority

186
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:23,380
on the Marsh pride.

187
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:29,060
Charm's youngest daughter
is still too young to breed.

188
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:34,978
To the males, she's nothing
more than another mouth

189
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:36,340
to share food with.

190
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:43,940
They don't want her in their pride.

191
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:59,780
Try as she might, Charm struggles
to defend her daughter.

192
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:08,980
Even she is no match
for an adult male.

193
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:15,498
Charm tries distracting them,

194
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:19,140
putting herself between them and her
cub.

195
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:24,860
But it's no good.

196
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:36,140
If her daughter stays,
the males will eventually kill her.

197
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:49,140
The cub has no choice but to leave.

198
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:00,500
And the males don't stop there.

199
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:05,580
Every young cub is driven out.

200
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:16,460
Their future is uncertain.

201
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:23,300
There's nothing Charm can do.

202
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:38,020
Eight months ago, Charm's
pride numbered ten lions.

203
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:43,540
Of them, only she and
Yaya now remain.

204
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:34,738
The return of the wildebeest
signals the end, at last,

205
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:36,740
of the hard times.

206
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:52,380
Time for a new beginning.

207
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:09,740
Charm is starting the process
of rebuilding the Marsh pride.

208
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:20,898
She and one of the males
have separated themselves

209
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:23,060
from the rest of the group.

210
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:33,020
Females are only able to conceive
once every few months.

211
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:39,540
For those crucial days,
the male won't leave her side.

212
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:10,220
Charm stays close to him
to strengthen their bond.

213
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:18,818
If the male isn't certain
any future cubs are his,

214
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:20,620
he will probably kill them.

215
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:45,700
Four months later.

216
00:42:56,300 --> 00:43:00,420
Charm is alone, away from the pride.

217
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:12,980
Over the last 14 months,
her dynasty has faced ruin.

218
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:30,300
But now, there is new hope.

219
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:51,860
Just two weeks old.

220
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:58,898
Charm gave birth away
from the others.

221
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:03,500
Inquisitive and clumsy lions
could be a threat to the newborns.

222
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:10,620
But her two cubs are still
extremely vulnerable.

223
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:18,378
Buffaloes seek out lion
cubs and will kill them

224
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:20,060
if they get the chance.

225
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:27,340
She shields them with her body.

226
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:35,698
Without her to protect them,
the buffalo will trample

227
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:36,740
them to death.

228
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:14,340
Charm has forced the entire
herd to back down.

229
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:42,978
Life is always dangerous
for lion cubs.

230
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:47,900
But these two have an experienced
mother to look after them.

231
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:56,660
At last, Charm's pride is increasing
again.

232
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:44,980
One male and one female.

233
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:53,420
And these cubs may soon
be joined by more.

234
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:13,500
Yaya has paired off with
the other adult male.

235
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:25,178
Soon, she too will have cubs.

236
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:27,180
Charm's grandchildren.

237
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:57,578
Charm is taking her cubs to meet
the rest of the Marsh pride

238
00:47:57,580 --> 00:47:59,260
for the first time.

239
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:08,298
Once their father has accepted
the cubs, he'll defend them

240
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:10,580
as fiercely as their mother.

241
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:23,740
They are the future
of his dynasty, too.

242
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:34,738
Charm has been away from the pride
since giving birth,

243
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:37,100
and hasn't seen Yaya for weeks.

244
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:47,178
Their bond has held through perhaps
the hardest times

245
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:49,300
in the pride's history.

246
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:59,418
With her daughter pregnant
and her son looking for a pride

247
00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:04,940
of his own, Charm's dynasty
and the Marsh pride will live on.

248
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:12,700
This extraordinary
lioness has succeeded.

249
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:30,858
To follow the story
of Charm and her family,

250
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:33,938
the Dynasties team travelled
to the Masai Mara,

251
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:36,820
one of these big cats'
last strongholds.

252
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:41,338
The crew's aim is to immerse
themselves in the lives

253
00:49:41,340 --> 00:49:44,698
of these powerful predators,
following them closely

254
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:47,378
for over 400 days.

255
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:52,178
But first, they need to master
the tricky task of identifying

256
00:49:52,180 --> 00:49:54,140
each individual lion.

257
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:58,658
Every lion has its own unique set
of whisker spots,

258
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:04,138
and put that together with coat
colour, ear notches, nose colour,

259
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:07,738
you can pretty much identify that
lion.

260
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:11,618
It would be really great if we could
stick moustaches on them and glasses

261
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:14,378
and hats, because that would make it
a lot easier for everybody

262
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:15,860
to understand who they were!

263
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:24,018
After weeks of following the family
for 12 hours a day,

264
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:25,940
they're getting to know the lions.

265
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:33,220
And the lions, it seems, are getting
to know them, too.

266
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:43,298
Well done.

267
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:44,938
It was the closest I've ever been.

268
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:47,818
She had her chin over the door.
Yeah!

269
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:50,300
I mean, my feet are
within two feet of her.

270
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:54,220
She's big when she's that close.

271
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:58,698
Before long, it becomes
clear that each lion

272
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:00,980
has its own particular character.

273
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:06,178
On a long project like this,
there's a real luxury,

274
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:09,498
and the luxury is you get
to know the individuals.

275
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:11,378
They are different to each other.

276
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:13,138
Some sit and follow, others watch.

277
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:15,738
Some are into everything,
some are funny,

278
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:18,018
some are really stupid, in a way.

279
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:20,258
I mean, you can see the rest
of the pride kind of rolling

280
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:24,540
their eyes as yet another male comes
in and blows another hunt.

281
00:51:31,580 --> 00:51:33,018
You begin to care for them.

282
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:35,218
You can't help it.

283
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:37,698
Charm, she is what a lion should be.

284
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:41,178
She's a provider, she's a mother,
she looks after cubs

285
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:43,378
that aren't her own,
she's the matriarch.

286
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:45,820
She's the... She's the dame.

287
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:54,978
The crew's attachment
to the lions is what makes

288
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:58,100
what happens next
so hard to deal with.

289
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:06,818
Poisoning is one of the biggest
threats lions face

290
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:08,980
across Africa today.

291
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:22,098
It can...

292
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:25,578
It becomes very close to home
when it's animals that you know

293
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:26,938
so well, individuals.

294
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:29,138
We know them really well now.

295
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:30,940
It's, um, much more...

296
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:34,740
Erm, you feel it much more.

297
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:43,298
Soon after the pride leave him,
emergency wildlife vets arrive

298
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:45,820
to try and save Charm's youngest
son.

299
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:52,420
But the poison has no
simple antidote.

300
00:52:57,660 --> 00:53:00,298
The vets try to ease the symptoms.

301
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:04,658
All they and the crew can do now
is wait in the hope he can recover

302
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:06,380
and return to the pride.

303
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:14,578
Eventually, it becomes clear nothing
more can be done for him.

304
00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:18,138
This animal is in a very bad
condition, a critical condition,

305
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:22,338
and we think it's not
going to make it.

306
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:26,658
Across Africa, the need for teams
like these is on the rise,

307
00:53:26,660 --> 00:53:30,180
treating wildlife after
encounters with man.

308
00:53:31,660 --> 00:53:33,778
It's just entirely wrong, isn't it?

309
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:34,898
Lions are so endangered.

310
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:37,018
There are hardly
any of them, really.

311
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:39,258
This is one of the best
places in the world.

312
00:53:39,260 --> 00:53:42,540
They're disappearing so quickly,
and then this happens to them.

313
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:47,660
Because of pressure
on the land, of people.

314
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:52,658
Conflict between humans
and lions is increasing

315
00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:54,818
throughout the continent.

316
00:53:54,820 --> 00:53:59,418
Dr Shivani Bhalla is a Kenyan
conservationist who has been working

317
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:03,338
with lions and local
communities for over a decade.

318
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:07,858
So many people are surprised to hear
that there's only about 20,000 lions

319
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:08,978
left in Africa.

320
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:11,898
There's less than 2,000
lions left in Kenya.

321
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:13,860
They are disappearing so quickly.

322
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:19,258
Lions don't have enough food
and they don't have enough space,

323
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:21,938
but communities also
don't have enough grazing

324
00:54:21,940 --> 00:54:23,138
for their livestock.

325
00:54:23,140 --> 00:54:25,018
They also don't have enough space.

326
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:27,978
We've got to try and understand both
sides of the picture.

327
00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:31,338
Coexistence between people
and lions is possible.

328
00:54:31,340 --> 00:54:33,818
Our strategy has been
working with warriors,

329
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:37,618
women, children, to really bring
them on board and engage them

330
00:54:37,620 --> 00:54:40,658
in lion conservation,
because they're the ones herding

331
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:43,658
livestock every day,
they're the ones coming into contact

332
00:54:43,660 --> 00:54:45,260
with wildlife every day.

333
00:54:47,020 --> 00:54:51,338
Community programmes have shown
that lions can actually recover

334
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:54,538
in areas where they used
to be once, but then their numbers

335
00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:56,500
declined because they were being
killed.

336
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:04,538
And Sophie and John witness
that power of recovery

337
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:06,940
first-hand, here with Charm.

338
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:10,858
Oh, wow!

339
00:55:10,860 --> 00:55:12,298
Well, that's that, I think.

340
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:13,578
Today's the day.

341
00:55:13,580 --> 00:55:17,618
She's gone in there
now to have her cubs,

342
00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:20,498
which is quite exciting, really.

343
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:22,978
We're kind of living it with her,
really, aren't we?

344
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:24,698
It's about sharing that experience.

345
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:27,620
That's the whole point.
That's why we're making the film.

346
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:39,538
Over a year ago, the team
set out to find a lion

347
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:41,418
and to tell its story.

348
00:55:41,420 --> 00:55:46,298
And here we are, over a year later,
and just there,

349
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:51,060
where the camera's pointing, we've
got Charm and two little cubs.

350
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:55,740
She's had such a hard, hard year.

351
00:55:56,900 --> 00:56:01,098
I don't think any of us could've
predicted a happier, better way.

352
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:02,938
She's the most amazing lion.

353
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:04,578
She's just incredible.

354
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:09,140
And... It's the perfect ending,
really.

355
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:15,018
Lions are incredibly resilient.

356
00:56:15,020 --> 00:56:20,140
Given space, enough food
and security, they can bounce back.

357
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:25,938
The challenges facing lion
conservationists are formidable.

358
00:56:25,940 --> 00:56:28,978
Indeed, unbelievable
though it may sound,

359
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:34,578
there is a real possibility
that, before long, lions in the wild

360
00:56:34,580 --> 00:56:36,940
could disappear entirely.

361
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:41,938
But if conservationists
and the people who have to live

362
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:46,818
alongside these great beasts
of prey can work together,

363
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:49,500
there is still a chance
to save them.

364
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:06,540
Next time... one of the last
great families of painted wolves.

365
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:10,858
An intense rivalry.

366
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:15,498
Mother against daughter,
each striving to rule.

367
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:19,940
Who will triumph, and can they bring
peace to these lands?
