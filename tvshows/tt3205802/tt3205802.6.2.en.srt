1
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:05,170
Jorge Castillo, I have
a warrant for your arrest.

2
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:06,540
I heard you took
Crawford's place

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,080
as the new
managing partner, right?

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,830
Convenient.
You think I had
something to do with this?

5
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:10,830
I didn't say that.

6
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:12,710
Then be smart
and stop talking.

7
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:14,000
Who is he?

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,580
 Vivian's boyfriend
until he O.D.'d on oxy.

9
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:18,670
Telesco's gonna say that
my mom gave him the drugs.

10
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:19,920
If she finds out
the truth...

11
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,500
Wait, y-you did this?

12
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,710
No UVA law student
has time to watch TV 

13
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:26,380
unless you dropped out
on me.
Gabriel: 'Course not.

14
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:27,460
Laurel needs us.

15
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:28,670

No, she's never needed us.

16
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:29,960
No, I'm going to the police
to report her missing.

17
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,380
That's already happened,
Michaela.

18
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,250
Frank and Bonnie are
with the police right now.

19
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:35,960
We're gonna beat out
all of the guilt

20
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,120
and the shame and the lies
and the fear.

21
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,620
Annalise knew
your birth father.

22
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,830
If that's true,
I'm gonna kill you.

23
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:52,790
Welcome
to the new semester,

24
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:54,920
which is your last semester
of law school.

25
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:58,330
From here on out, you will be
taking point on your cases.

26
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:01,790
I'm just here to give you enough
rope to hang yourselves with.

27
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:05,210
Our first client 
Hector Diaz.

28
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:07,880
He crossed the border illegally
from Sinaloa, Mexico,

29
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,670
and now wants asylum.

30
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:13,120
Be ready to pitch your strategy
at C&G in two hours.

31
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,210
Class dismissed.
Professor Keating, wait.

32
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:17,080
Uh, there's a rumor that
Laurel Castillo dropped out.

33
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,040
Shouldn't someone
get her seat?

34
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,580
Also Michaela Pratt.
She's not here, either.

35
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,420
 I didn't know
your father, Michaela.

36
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,580
It says right here you did.

37
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:30,080
I was an intern on his case.

38
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,420
-That means you knew him.
-No 

39
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:32,500
You're not making
any sense!

40
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:36,000
Listen, put that down,
and I'll explain.

41
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:39,920
I was an undergrad
at Tennessee,

42
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,880
volunteering at the law firm
that was defending him.

43
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,580
Is this the same story
you told Wes?

44
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:46,500
Listen 
I'm part of your pathetic
kid rescue collection?

45
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,790
I didn't know who you were
until we picked the K5.

46
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:49,960
Oh, it was a coincidence 

47
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,040
that's what you expect me
to believe?!

48
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,330
No, I never told you
because I knew

49
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:53,460
it wasn't the story
you wanted to hear.

50
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:54,790
All I ever want
is for you to be honest!

51
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:57,210
No, you want me to make sense
out of your pain,

52
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:58,500
to say that
I knew your father

53
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,380
and that there was a good reason
why he gave you up,

54
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:03,000
and I wish I could give
that to you, Michaela.

55
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,540
I do,
but I didn't know the man.

56
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:08,750
He was a stranger to me,
just like he is to you.

57
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,330
I'm sorry.

58
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:21,670
I'm just sorry
you're so dumb

59
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:23,790
that you think
I'd believe you...

60
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,790
...bitch.

61
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:30,750

Ms. Pratt is out sick.

62
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,710
The free seat goes to the
student who came the closest

63
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:35,790
to getting it last semester 
Asher Millstone.

64
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:37,420
Yes!
Sweet baby Jesus.

65
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:39,500
Study up on the client.
I'll see you at C&G.

66
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,500
Where is she?

67
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,750
At home,
boycotting you.

68
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:47,040
And stabbing
her AK voodoo doll.

69
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,330
You can't expect us to buy
that this was all a coincidence.

70
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:52,670
It was.
And what's my coincidence?

71
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:54,000
You never explained to me
why you picked me for the K5.

72
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,710
Because
you're my secret baby.

73
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:00,040
You all are.

74
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:05,080
Here, the first reference
I found of a Dwight Halpern

75
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:08,330
is in Dixon Correctional
Institute in '91 

76
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:09,500
Right after
my birth mother was shot.

77
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,120
Then he got transferred
in 2001 to BB Rayburn.

78
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,710
So he's still
in Louisiana?

79
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,210
I'm checking.

80
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:19,620
Or we could just
quit this right now.

81
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,380
I mean,
he shot your mom.

82
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:22,580
That's just the story
I was told.

83
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,330
He went to jail for it.

84
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:26,960
Like innocent black men
don't go to jail all the time.

85
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,380
There! That's him.

86
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:31,290
Orleans Parish Prison,
2001 to 2005.

87
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:33,040
Mm. There's no records
after that,

88
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,620
so maybe
he got released.

89
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:36,620
No.

90
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:37,710
What? Are 
Are you sure?

91
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:40,120
Maybe he got out
on good behavior.

92
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,330
They lost him in Katrina.

93
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:43,170
Who?
My father.

94
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:44,540
There's no sign of him
after 2005

95
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,750
because his records
got destroyed in Katrina.

96
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:47,790
Unless you
disappeared him?

97
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:49,170
Stop this.
Why?

98
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:50,420
So I don't find out
the real reason

99
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:51,790
you've been lying to me
this whole time?

100
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:54,460
You can be angry with me,
but you can't miss class.

101
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,210
That's what you're mad about?

102
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:57,620
Fail me.

103
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,460
Oh, you think I won't?
Do it.

104
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:00,790
Then I'll go to
the disciplinary board

105
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:02,250
and tell them
about your little relapse.

106
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,210
I'm trying to have
an adult conversation with you.

107
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:06,120
Adult this.

108
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,580
Who'd you piss off
this time?

109
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:26,210
The hell
is wrong with you?

110
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:27,960
Stole my husband and now
you got to take my son, too?

111
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,790
No, this was all Gabriel.

112
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:33,380
But you knew he was lying to me
this entire time.

113
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:35,420
I had to drive to UVA,
thinking I'd surprise him,

114
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:36,580
only to find out
he's here with you?

115
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:37,830
Let's go somewhere
and talk.

116
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,830
No, you argued a case
in front of the Supreme Court.

117
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,250
You can handle
fighting me in public.

118
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,620
No. I don't want to
fight at all.

119
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:45,620
Too late. I'm here.
I'm ready.

120
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:48,210
I didn't know Gabriel existed
until he showed up here.

121
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:49,380
I didn't know Sam knew
he existed.

122
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:52,620
Oh, Sam knew.
He absolutely knew.

123
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,420
You want to know
when he found out?
I don't.

124
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:56,210
The same night he stood
in our living room

125
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:58,790
and announced
he was leaving me for you.

126
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:01,880
He shocked me with that news,
so I shocked his ass right back.

127
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,250
And I knew exactly
how our man would react.

128
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:05,830
Didn't disappoint,
either.

129
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:08,040
He said, "Never mind,"

130
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,330
he'd tell you
it was over.

131
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:15,620
That's right.
He chose me.

132
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:18,580
I just wasn't pathetic enough
to take him back.

133
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:25,000
So you lied to your son
about his father.

134
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,170
He's angry about that.

135
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:29,330
If you want him back,
talk to him.

136
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:31,500
Did you kill Sam?

137
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:37,830
I've never killed anyone
in my life, but try me.

138
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,080
How can I help you?

139
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,670
Here.

140
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:54,380
My fiancée,
Laurel Castillo 

141
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:56,710
she's missing,
and the police have no leads.

142
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:58,330
My God.
I'm so sorry.

143
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:02,000
I found this
in her jewelry.

144
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,080
It's  It's one of yours,
right?

145
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,670
Opens a safe deposit box?

146
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:07,580
Are  Are you listed
on the account?

147
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:09,380
You think
I'd be asking if I was?

148
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:12,580
Uh, sorry. Dumb question.
It's just...

149
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:16,210
I'm begging you,
Rachael.

150
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,750
Yes. Laurel Castillo's
one of the access-holders.

151
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,210
One of them?

152
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:34,210
There's another
family member listed.

153
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:36,620
Uh, her mother, Sandrine?
Xavier?

154
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,170
Without
proof of your relationship,

155
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:39,960
I can't tell you
anything else.

156
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,120
So sorry.

157
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,580
Temporary
protected status.

158
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,290
Where's Mr. Maddox?
Who cares?

159
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:49,880
I just gave you the perfect
strategy for this case.

160
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,460
Uh, a better strategy's
arguing Mr. Diaz

161
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:53,080
was persecuted
because of his race.

162
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,040
You mean the gang violence
that's rampant

163
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,580
in Sinaloa right now.

164
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,170
Gang violence is a stereotype
about the region.

165
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:58,580
Clearly, this should
disqualify Mr. Walsh.

166
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:59,580
-Mr. Walsh wins.
-What? Bull donks!

167
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,040
-His idea sucks!
-Seriously?

168
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,500
I need this more than him.
I missed a whole semester.

169
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,290
Fine, Mr. Millstone
is second chair.

170
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,670
Mr. Maddox, my office.

171
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,290
Your mother's here.

172
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:14,960
What?
Yeah. She stopped me on campus.

173
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,080
You swear
you didn't know?

174
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,210
No, of course not.
I had no clue.

175
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:19,830
Why wouldn't she tell me
she was here?

176
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:21,750
Well, she's your mother,
not mine.

177
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:24,120
What did she say?
These are questions
for her, Gabriel,

178
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,040
so go and talk to her.

179
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:34,920
Look who's got
that Cali glow.

180
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,080
Well, that's menopause,
girl.

181
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,120
I'll take it.

182
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,540
You on hot flashes is better
than every male partner

183
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,540
giving me side-eye
like I stole their birthright.

184
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,540
Really, all I stole
was a dead man's office...

185
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:47,880
...which, let me tell you,
is still giving me the creeps.

186
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,710
Hey.
I'm your boss now.

187
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:53,250
I'll cut off the funds
to your clinic if you
don't listen to me.

188
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,460
Well, I'm sorry.
I have to go.

189
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:58,830
What's going on?

190
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:00,330
Sam's ex is in town.

191
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:02,620
Oh.
Why is that a thing?

192
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:05,040
Everything dealing with Sam
is a thing.

193
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:08,540
I'll be a better employee
tomorrow.

194
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:12,080
I was looking for a friend
more than an employee.

195
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:18,120
You ready to rock,
Bette Davis?
Is that a gay joke?

196
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,120
It's an "All About Eve" joke,
'cause the understudy here

197
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,500
is about to become
the star of this case.

198
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,500
I'm so confused.

199
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,710
I'm stealing
our client from you.

200
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:25,500
Consider it nice
I gave you a warning.

201
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:33,380
I'm sorry.
W-Where's my client?

202
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:46,960
Uh...
T-Tu, Hector.

203
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:50,170
Tu in, uh  uh, U.S.A.

204
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:52,290
Uh, duh 
Tu parentes, dónde 

205
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:55,670
Are they,
um...in Mexico?

206
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:57,540
Uh...

207
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:06,000
Did Annalise tell you to do that
just to torture me?

208
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,170
Bonnie: You think
she was wearing a wire?

209
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:11,580
Of course,
for the FBI, Hannah 

210
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,580
Or the Governor.
Take your pick.

211
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:16,000
Here, this is everything
Frank found on Vivian.

212
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,420
I would ask him to get more,
but he's MIA.

213
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,750
Please tell me he's not doing
something stupid.
I'll find him.

214
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:21,830
Good, and find
something on Vivian

215
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:23,210
to scare her back
to Chicago.

216
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:24,620
On it.

217
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,620
Wait.
You both wanna see this.

218
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,250
It's from 10 years ago,

219
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,540
when Tegan was at
C&G's Mexico office.

220
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:33,620
So?
It's the same year Laurel
was kidnapped.

221
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:36,040
C&G got her released.
Tegan negotiated that?

222
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,330
Not sure, but I just want us all
to keep a closer eye on her.

223
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:41,080
No, you want me
to start drinking again.

224
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,670
Shoulda stayed in Malibu.

225
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:48,920
Where's Annalise?
Oh, she's not here.

226
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,330
You said this was
an Annalise emergency.
Yeah, it is.

227
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:53,040
The emergency is that she's not
answering her phone.

228
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,250
Look, Connor and I,
we need a translator,

229
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,420
and since you say "Castillo"
so well 

230
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,250
I'm the managing partner
of a giant law firm.

231
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,830
You think I have time
to be your translator?
I mean, you should.

232
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:01,960
At least, if you want to meet
your pro-bono hours requirement.

233
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,000
Uh...

234
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Our client is 8 years old
and he's very, very adorable!

235
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,120
When's his hearing?
Connor: Two days.

236
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,120
I'm planning on arguing for
asylum due to gang violence.

237
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,920
Connor's idea.
It's lame, right?

238
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,710
Okay, well, no strategy
will work if he doesn't

239
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:17,210
tell us anything,
is the point.

240
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,620
Wait,
w-w-what's he drawing?

241
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,620
¿Sí?

242
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:38,080
It's a gang member.

243
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,210
If we show this
to the judge,

244
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:41,210
it'll show he's been
oppressed by violence.

245
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:57,620
We got a gang,
just not the right one.

246
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:00,460
Vivian: It's Vivian.
Hit me at the beep.

247
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,960
You dead in a ditch somewhere?

248
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,920
That's the only excuse
I'm taking for you

249
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,500
not calling me back.

250
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,210
I hate you for convincing me
to find my father,

251
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:19,750
because  found him.
Well, sort of.

252
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,460
He's lost in the system.

253
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,250
And even though I want to
go back to not caring about

254
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,170
finding him, you put it
in my head that I should,

255
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:26,380
which means that all
the frustration

256
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,620
that I'm feeling
is your fault.

257
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,380
Mm.

258
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,880
Michaela 
Unh-unh. Pants off right now.

259
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,250
My mom is here.
Oh, my God. Where?

260
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:39,040
Not here in the apartment.
Here in town.

261
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,670
How mad is she?

262
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:45,250
Mad enough that she won't
return my calls.

263
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:48,710
I only know she's here
because of Annalise.

264
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:51,040
What?
She went to her first,
which is crazy,

265
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,040
but that's my mom
for you.

266
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:58,880
Well...since
we're both stressed.

267
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,170
Perfect.

268
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,330
Vivian: Gabriel.

269
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:10,540
Oh, my God.
Get up, get up,
get up, get up, get up.

270
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,540
I hear you.

271
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,960
One minute!

272
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,670
Boy, open this door.

273
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:20,750
Hi. Uh, Ms. Maddox.

274
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,120
Michaela. Pratt.

275
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,170
So lovely to finally
meet you.

276
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:25,750
You live in this apartment,
Michaela?

277
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:26,960
Uh 

278
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,420
No. I-I have a house
of my own.

279
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,620
I mean, I share it,
I don't own it.

280
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,830
Thank God.
It's kind of gross.

281
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:34,790
How about you go to that gross
house so I can talk to my son?

282
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:37,790
Of course.
Uh, just lovely to...

283
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:40,210
Thank you. Okay.

284
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,880
Connor:
You drunk this morning?

285
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,670
Is that why you forgot to tell
us that our client's a child?

286
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:49,040
Or is this some hint about why
you picked me for the K5?

287
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,330
Hector's my brother
or something.

288
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:51,960
Attorneys get incomplete
case files all the time.

289
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,080
They only meet their clients
on the first day of court.

290
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,500
You're lucky I let you
meet Hector before.

291
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,080
So figure out this
impossible case on my own,

292
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,670
is what you're saying?
Like an actual lawyer. Go.

293
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,670
Tell us what's wrong.
Nothing's wrong.

294
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:05,460
Okay, literally every time
you've ever said that to us,

295
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,040
something has been very,
very wrong.

296
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:11,580
Vivian's here.

297
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:15,170
Gabriel: Why didn't you pick up
any of my calls?

298
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:17,580
I was running around a city
I don't know. My phone died.

299
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:19,290
So not because you were off
high with some guy?

300
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:21,330
Gabriel Vincent Maddox 

301
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:22,710
Just tell me why you went
to Annalise before me.

302
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:25,120
Because I assumed you'd lied,
just like you've been lying

303
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,330
about being with her
this whole time.

304
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:29,710
She's my professor, Ma.
I'm not with her.

305
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:30,790
Ain't that a relief.

306
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:32,290
God knows
it crossed my mind

307
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:34,040
considering her
previous behavior.

308
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,830
Don't make this about her.
He left you.

309
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:37,540
Sam. That's who
you should blame.

310
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:39,380
I'll blame them both,
especially now

311
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:40,960
that she's brainwashing
my son.

312
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,420
I came here for answers.
That's all.

313
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,620
Answers I could have
given you.

314
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,460
You lied to me
about this my whole life.

315
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,040
I always said your father
stepped out on us.

316
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,540
Where's the lie in that?
You said he never came back
to see me again.

317
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:50,790
That's true.
He didn't.

318
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:53,620
I met him...Ma.

319
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,210
When I was 11 years old,
he came to see us.

320
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:04,960
Grandma?

321
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,380
Gabriel?

322
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,210
Get in here right now.

323
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:09,670
Gabriel:
Grandma never told you?

324
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:12,830
No.

325
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:14,460
Be honest.

326
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:18,330
I never knew.

327
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:20,670
I'll swear
on the damn Bible.

328
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:25,250
Baby, I never meant for you
to find out this way.

329
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,670
You never meant for me
to find out at all.

330
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:31,830
Because I knew you'd be hurt,
and look at you now.

331
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:38,420
The truth? I kept him
from you because...

332
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:41,620
he wasn't a good man,
for either of us,

333
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,620
and that is no way
for you to grow up 

334
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:47,040
learning how to be a man
from a bad one.

335
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,040
Maybe that's wrong.
I'm sorry.

336
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,170
But I'm here now, and I'll tell
you whatever you want to know

337
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:54,920
about the man 
good, bad, ugly.

338
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:58,380
Just don't shut me out,
baby.

339
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:03,000
I think you should go.
Over my dead body.

340
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,250
Gab
I just need some time.

341
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:07,290
What you need to do
is talk to me, baby.

342
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:08,620
I'm not your baby!

343
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:11,750
I'm a grown-ass man,
and I got this way despite you,

344
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:12,830
not because of you.

345
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:25,040
Did she seem
like a drug addict?

346
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,040
She seemed like a mom.

347
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,880
Like a moley mom?
What?

348
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:31,670
Uh, she's probably a mole
for the FBI like her moley son.

349
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:34,830
Shut up with that.
Yeah, there's no way
that Sam's first wife showing up

350
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:38,380
at the exact moment the FBI's
stalking all of us is bad news.

351
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,500
Not at all.

352
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,120
Maybe she just came here
to visit her son

353
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,830
who she loves
and misses.

354
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:46,830
Never mind.
That was the old me talking.

355
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:51,710
Okay. I have something
to confess,

356
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:54,500
but promise
no telling Annalise.

357
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,000
Gabey's a mole?
He's not a mole.

358
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,580
He just...

359
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:09,250
He kind of told me
he killed his mom's boyfriend.

360
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,880
Hey.
Where are you?

361
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,460
Pittsburgh. Dad's in trouble
with some bookie.

362
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:31,670
I'm helping him out.

363
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:34,080
Well, I need your help.
Vivian's here.

364
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,500
Are you serious?
Yeah.

365
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,330
Annalise gave me the file
you put together on her.

366
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,880
What's this sealed file
in her arrest report?

367
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,040
I never found out.

368
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,080
Do you think you can?

369
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,750
I'll look into it.
Gotta go.

370
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:05,880
I'm here for Laurel.
I can't not know anymore...

371
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:09,750
if she's...okay.

372
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:13,120
Just tell me
she's safe.

373
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,170
What is this?

374
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:17,000
Some game
to make me believe

375
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
that you don't know
where she is?

376
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,040
I don't.
Neither do I.

377
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,210
Told the FBI
the same thing.

378
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:23,120
Xavier took her.
We both know that.

379
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,250
Don't come here again.

380
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:30,500
Help me find her.

381
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:37,750
I found him.
Oliver!

382
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,960
I did some old-school
library hacking

383
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,710
and found a newsletter
from a prison in Virginia

384
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:43,540
that mentions your dad.

385
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:47,420
Listen  "Inmate D. Halpern
received the Warden's Award

386
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:49,380
for starting an online
charity that supports

387
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,830
domestic abuse victims."

388
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:52,420
A charity.
It shows he's reformed.

389
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:54,210
We don't know
that that's him.
But we do.

390
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:56,210
Oliver.

391
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:58,000
He has your eyes.

392
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:10,330
It's to a safe deposit box
in Laurel's name.

393
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:12,420
She shares it
with a family member.

394
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:13,830
Is it you?

395
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:15,040
No.

396
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:18,460
Sandrine? Xavier?

397
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:22,500
I get it.

398
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:26,330
That hurt you feel,
that kick in your heart?

399
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:27,920
I've been living
with that pain every day

400
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,540
since Laurel
was a child.

401
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:32,670
Think about
how scary that is.

402
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:34,880
You wake up one day
to find out just how much

403
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,040
your own daughter
hates you.

404
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,080
I still don't get why.

405
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,710
I just know that she wanted
to punish me, and it worked.

406
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:45,540
Look where I am now.

407
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:46,920
You did this to yourself.

408
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:50,540
No. Laurel did this.

409
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:54,170
And she's probably
got the same plan for you,

410
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:57,290
Annalise, and whoever else
she's talking to the FBI about.

411
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:03,670
The biggest tragedy
in all this?

412
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:06,120
Christopher.

413
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,500
I tried to save him,
to keep her from destroying him

414
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,500
like every other man
in her life  me, Dominick,

415
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:14,170
Wes...and now you.

416
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:17,120
You want to worry
about someone?

417
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,080
Worry about
that sweet little boy.

418
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,710
Asher:
We say Hector's covered

419
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:30,540
by the Trafficking Victims
Protection Act.

420
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:31,710
 Well,
what was he trafficked for?

421
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:33,040
House cleaning?
Sex work?

422
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,460
If you don't know, you can't
prove improper purpose.

423
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,000
Then we try to use DACA.
He's too young for DACA.

424
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,620
I got it. Here.

425
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:41,000
We, uh 
We get Hector to redraw this

426
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,380
without
the ICE letters.

427
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:44,170
That way, we prove
that he experienced

428
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:45,670
violent persecution
at home.

429
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:48,170
You're gonna coach a small child
to offer doctored testimony?

430
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:49,790
You would do it.
Well, I'm good enough
not to get caught.

431
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:51,210
You're not.

432
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:53,750
You're all a disappointment.
Class dismissed.

433
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,040
Gabriel.

434
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,250
You're going home.
Excuse me?

435
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:05,830
Not to your apartment, but back
to Chicago with your mother.

436
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,000
That's not your decision.

437
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,830
Think about our client.

438
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:11,580
That boy probably wants nothing
more than to be with his family,

439
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,580
and here you are
throwing yours away.

440
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,420
She threw away my chance
to know my father.

441
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:18,040
Then forgive her.
I mean it, Gabriel.

442
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,620
Listen,
she made one big mistake,

443
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:20,960
but she gave you
your life.

444
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,330
She was high
most of my life.

445
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:25,170
Because she was in pain,
just like you are right now.

446
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:28,080
So go and be the man you keep
saying you want to be

447
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,880
and forgive her.

448
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,170
You know you want to.

449
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:41,120
Hey.

450
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,380
I need a second,
Asher.

451
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,830
I know how we get them
to leave.

452
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:48,420
Gabriel killed
Vivian's boyfriend.

453
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:52,290
What?
Yeah, he told Michaela,
or at least...he hinted at it.

454
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:53,670
That's game over, right?

455
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:59,040
We can't use that.
We just have to threaten
to use that.

456
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:02,830
We can't keep hurting people and
not expect them to hurt us back.

457
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:06,040
AK.

458
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:10,670
What happened to Laurel and
Christopher wasn't your fault.

459
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:16,790
Go help Connor.
He needs it.

460
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,080
Hey.

461
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,460
Hate to say
I told you so.

462
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:27,290
What does that mean?

463
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:29,500
Your new boss is hanging out
with Vivian Maddox.

464
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,670
I don't work with your son,
Ms. Maddox.

465
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:48,880
Middleton University
oversees our clinic.

466
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,080
Professor Keating's
involvement in the clinic

467
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,880
is why I'm coming to you,
as a concerned parent.

468
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,460
What's the concern?

469
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:57,460
I've heard some rumors.

470
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:00,290
People love to gossip,
especially about Annalise.

471
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:02,670
Rumors about her being involved
in illegal activity.

472
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:09,080
I'm still not getting
what this has to do

473
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,960
with your son
or my firm.

474
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,120
If Annalise Keating were
arrested for illegal activity

475
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,330
while working for you,
there'd be lawsuits,

476
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:19,330
many of which your firm
would pick up the tab for.

477
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:21,500
I mean, if my son
got implicated in her crimes,

478
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,080
I know I'd sue you.

479
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,500
It's Telesco.

480
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:29,330
She's pissed I got her fired
from the FBI,

481
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:32,290
so she sent in Vivian.

482
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:34,580
Girl must be scraping
the bottom of the barrel

483
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:36,210
if she's using the ex-wife
to take you down.

484
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,670
What's wrong?

485
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:41,880
Tell me.

486
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,080
Are you playing me?

487
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,790
I'm trying
to be your friend here,

488
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:51,620
but you're making it
really hard.

489
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:54,080
I'm not the one
hiding things.
Really?

490
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,330
Because I covered
for your ass

491
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:58,540
when you went to the "spa"
in California.

492
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:01,710
Meanwhile, I was here being
interrogated by the FBI.

493
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:04,120
They think I killed Emmett, and
now you're accusing me of this?

494
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,960
No. Unh-unh. Nope.

495
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,330
Why didn't you tell me that
you were meeting with Vivian?

496
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:09,920
Because the last time
I gave you bad news,

497
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,040
you ended up in rehab.

498
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:20,620
I'm one of the only friends
you've got here.

499
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:23,330
You need me more
than I need you.

500
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:25,540
But if you
can't trust me 

501
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:26,330
I can.

502
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,920
And I do.

503
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,000
Thank you.

504
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:39,790
Hey, where are you?

505
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:42,000
Virginia.
What?

506
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,790
My father's in prison here.
Maybe.

507
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:46,580
I'm waiting for the clerk
to tell me.

508
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:49,120
So distract me?

509
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,500
How did it go
with your mom?

510
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:53,290
Not good.

511
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:55,620
To the point Annalise
told me I should go home.

512
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:01,920
Y-You agree?

513
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:06,710
I-I think that's a decision
only you can make.

514
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:10,210
Right.

515
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:12,540
I-Is this you
pushing me away?

516
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:14,920
Because I've been thinking
what we have is real.

517
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,880
If that's not
how you feel 
Miss Pratt?

518
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,250
Uh  I'll ca
I'll call you later.

519
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:26,080
Good news.

520
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,880
Our records show
that "D. Halpern"

521
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,290
is your Dwight Halpern.

522
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:33,080
He's here?
Was.

523
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,620
He got transferred
to Mohawk Correctional Facility

524
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:37,250
two years ago.

525
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:39,420
Uh...
Uh, where's that?

526
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:40,620
Upstate New York.

527
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,120
 This is a small
amount of cocaine.

528
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:23,960
Why even prosecute
Ms...Maddox for this?

529
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,960
I'm not sure we should,
but until I see

530
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,170
what's under seal,
I can't make a recommendation

531
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:29,790
one way or another
to my boss.

532
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:31,500
Who is your boss
right now?

533
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,330
Stevens.

534
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:35,380
He wants us to put pressure
on low-level offenders.

535
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:37,330
Hence, here I am.

536
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:43,830
It's Vivian's federal file.
I got it unsealed.

537
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:46,830
She's on probation
for drugs  meth.

538
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:49,080
We already knew that.
But we didn't know why.

539
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,920
Here.

540
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:57,290
She was arrested for drug
trafficking just last year.

541
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:01,580
She's in no place
to be threatening anyone.

542
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:04,000
How'd you get this?

543
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,380
Doesn't matter.
Bonnie,
you can't keep doing this.

544
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:08,790
It's fine.
Do you want to die?

545
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:14,580
My counselor at rehab said that
I'd die if I kept this up 

546
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:18,170
fixing other people's crap
instead of my own.

547
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:19,960
Now you're doing it, too.

548
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:26,790
Why'd you come back?

549
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,500
Really?

550
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:35,620
And don't you dare say
it was for us.

551
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:38,290
Why not?

552
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:40,460
You can't handle the fact
that I love you?

553
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:43,880
I know you love me.

554
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:46,830
I just want you
to love yourself, too.

555
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:49,620
You're telling me that?

556
00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:01,290
They're coming for us,
Bonnie.

557
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:03,880
It's not if, it's when.

558
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:11,710
Uh, in Me in Mexico,
dónde está?

559
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:12,830
Uh, in Sinaloa?
Here?

560
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:14,290
Are there 
Are there gangs here? Bad men?

561
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:17,460
Hey. I come bearing gifts.

562
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:19,670
Cheesesteak
is the universal language.

563
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:21,500
What am I gonna do?

564
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,080
I have nothing to offer
the judge tomorrow.

565
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,830
Wait, that's not the only gift
I smuggled in.

566
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:28,210
How'd you do that?

567
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:30,580
Oh. I'm a rule-breaker.
Haven't you heard?

568
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:33,330
And I downloaded an app
to translate 

569
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:35,670
H-Hey, Hector!
That That's not for...

570
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:41,080
Oh, my God.

571
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,380
H-Hector? Mi bebé.

572
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:46,920
Mi bebé. ¿Estás bien?
¿Estás salvo?

573
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:54,670
Her name's Marisol.

574
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:56,170
She speaks English, not great,
b-better than my Spanish.

575
00:27:56,170 --> 00:27:56,920
But the 
the point is she's here.

576
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,710
Where?
Maryland.

577
00:27:58,710 --> 00:27:59,920
She came last year
to work

578
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,710
and then sent for Hector
when she had money.

579
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:03,330
He was with other people
from their town,

580
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:04,290
but they got separated
at the border.

581
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:06,500
So we get Marisol
to testify for him, right?

582
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:09,380
I mean, she can speak
to the gang violence back home.

583
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:10,960
You can't ask her to do that.
Why?

584
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,120
Because ICE uses kids
like Hector as bait

585
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,960
to arrest undocumented
parents.

586
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,120
They'll both get deported.

587
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,380
Okay.
W-Well, what do we do?

588
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:20,380
Well, you have to come up
with Plan B.

589
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:21,540
Are you serious?
I need your help.

590
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:23,750
Connor, you're graduating
in three months.

591
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:25,540
I'm not gonna be around
after that

592
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:27,210
to give you
all the answers.

593
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:28,750
So you have
to get used to it now.

594
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:38,580
Half a gram.
$50.

595
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:44,120
Keep the rest.

596
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,580
Gracias.

597
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,710
 Annalise?

598
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,500
Annalise?

599
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:02,210
Annalise?

600
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:04,620
Where the hell
have you been?

601
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:06,750
Uh, my dad got caught up
in some crap.

602
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:08,170
So did I.

603
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:10,880
Aunt Viv's here, and I need you
to help me deal with her.

604
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:14,920
It's meth.

605
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,500
You're gonna plant that
on Vivian,

606
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,170
and I'll take care
of the rest.

607
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:23,380
Frank.

608
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,670
Frank!

609
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:34,620
We don't know
what kind of trap

610
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:35,920
the FBI's laying out
for us right now.

611
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,540
We got to be smart.

612
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:39,040
Where were you?
Really?

613
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:44,960
It's for
a safe deposit box.

614
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,750
I found it
in Laurel's room.

615
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:50,120
Only one other person
has access  a family member.

616
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,330
Thought it
might be Jorge.

617
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:53,750
It's not.
I know that now.

618
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:54,880
It's Wes.

619
00:29:57,290 --> 00:30:00,670
I wrote it all down.
Everything I know.

620
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:03,000
I have another copy
in a safe deposit box.

621
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,620
One phone call,
and it gets sent to the police.

622
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:09,920
What does it say?

623
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:14,670
Everything, probably.
Sam, Rebecca. All of it.

624
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:19,250
I'll find a way in.

625
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:23,500
I'll figure it out.
I always do.

626
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:30,540
Judge Bines:
You have a witness you'd like
to examine, Mr. Walsh?

627
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:31,830
Yes, Your Honor.

628
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:34,210
I'd like to call
Immigration and Customs Agent

629
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:36,170
Zach Mills to the stand,
please.

630
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:39,670
You're up.

631
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:41,250
For the record,
I don't condone this plan.

632
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:42,040
What plan?

633
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:46,620
Aah! No! No! No!

634
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:48,620
Tranquilo, Hector.
Nadie te va a hacer daño.

635
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:51,040
No le dejes que me lleve!
Por favor!

636
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,830
Mr. Walsh,
may I suggest a recess?

637
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:54,420
That's not necessary,
Your Honor.

638
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:56,830
This man is not
a real ICE agent.

639
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:59,830
Hector's reaction, however,
is very much real.

640
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:01,830
Or you coached him!
How?

641
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:04,460
Hector can't even talk
due to the trauma

642
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:06,460
that he's suffered inside
the detention center.

643
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:07,960
Ms. Price,
were you part of this charade?

644
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:11,540
No, Your Honor, this was my idea
to illustrate the horror

645
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:13,540
of my client's inhumane
living conditions.

646
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:15,750
His living conditions
are not at issue here.

647
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:18,960
Article 37 of the U.N.
Convention on Rights of Children

648
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,580
demands  "No child shall
be subjected to torture."

649
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:25,120
By that standard alone,
my client deserves asylum.

650
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:28,330
Google "Korematsu Chief Justice
repugnant."

651
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:30,750
...to secure our borders.
Roper v. Simmons.

652
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:33,920
The Supreme Court said that
international standards matter

653
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,290
in how we treat children.

654
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:36,880
Eh, the Supreme Court
also made clear

655
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,620
that that those standards
are not binding.
Here.

656
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:41,040
Just last year,
the Chief Justice wrote

657
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,620
that the internment
of Japanese-Americans

658
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:45,540
in World War II
was "morally repugnant."

659
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:46,710
Look at this boy.

660
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:48,500
Can you honestly say
that the conditions

661
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:51,330
we have him in
are not morally repugnant?

662
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:55,380
Your Honor, the Chief Justice's
remarks were about Korematsu,

663
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,380
a case that has never
been overruled.

664
00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:00,210
Let me quote
the Chief Justice.

665
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:03,330
"Korematsu was gravely wrong
the day it was decided,

666
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:05,460
has been overruled
in the court of history,

667
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:08,080
and has no place in law
under the Constitution."

668
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,460
We're talking about immigrant
processing centers.

669
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:12,460
We're not talking
about wartime camps.

670
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:15,500
We're talking about rounding up
innocent children

671
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,670
on American soil and caging them
behind barbed wire.

672
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:20,710
How is that any different than
what we did to the Japanese?

673
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:22,460
Mr. Walsh,
I appreciate your point 

674
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:25,290
At least six non-American
children have died

675
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:27,080
in the custody of ICE 
Mr. Walsh, let me speak.

676
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,710
And I refuse to wait
for my client to die...
Connor, stop.

677
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:32,120
...due to the neglect
and cruelty that he is suffering

678
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,880
at the hands
of the American Government!

679
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:37,710
I agree with you,
Mr. Walsh!

680
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:40,670
And while no one has ever
had the creativity to invoke

681
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:44,290
these precedents, I cannot allow
them to decide this case.

682
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:47,620
Your Honor 
What I can do is issue
a continuance

683
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:49,830
based on your client's
mental state.

684
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:51,830
Ms. Ford,
please coordinate

685
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:54,040
with the Office
of Refugee Resettlement

686
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,460
to place him
in foster care.

687
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:57,620
Your Honor, there's no legal
standing for this.

688
00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:00,420
Unless you can argue
a legal justification

689
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:03,540
for the torture of children,
you've lost.

690
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:05,380
Mr. Walsh?

691
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:06,670
Well done.

692
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,120
Tell him that
I'll get his mom asylum.

693
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,380
Okay. I know
you're feeling yourself 

694
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:23,790
Look, Marisol can actually
testify to the gang violence,

695
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:26,960
and if we get her asylum, it'll
be easier to get Hector asylum.

696
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,500
Are you this presumptuous
when Annalise is around?

697
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:31,330
You know it's a good idea.
Just tell him.

698
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:35,620
Mira.

699
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:46,460
Sí, Hector.

700
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:48,040
Promise.

701
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:57,460
Can Connor
actually do that?

702
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:59,460
Highly unlikely.

703
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:05,540
Wait, wait, wait!
Michaela Pratt.

704
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:07,960
I just drove seven hours to see
my client, Dwight Halpern.

705
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:11,540
We close at 5:00. It's 5:03.
I don't get paid overtime.

706
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:14,540
Dwight Halpern's not my client!
He's my father!

707
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:18,290
I-I never met him,
and up until a few days ago,

708
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:20,710
I didn't want to.

709
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:22,080
He's...

710
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:27,170
He's nothing to me.
A stranger.

711
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:30,920
I didn't care if he was lost
in the stupid system.

712
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:33,330
But then I found him.

713
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:34,750
You can't lose
a human being.

714
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:36,960
T-T-That's not a thing.

715
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,170
He's a man, not a file,
even if America

716
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:40,540
doesn't want us to know
the difference.

717
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:43,920
Because I found him.

718
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,170
He's here.

719
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:50,750
My father is here,
and I really don't want to wait

720
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:52,880
another night to meet him.

721
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,420
Please.

722
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:06,500
We gotta talk.
Let me guess  now Tegan's KGB?

723
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,500
Tegan's not who I'm worried
about right now.

724
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:13,250
Vivian's talking
to the FBI.

725
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:23,120
Your son killed
your boyfriend.

726
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:32,790
So it's true. You're as
desperate as Hannah said?

727
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:34,250
You and Hannah still talk?
Give that bitch my regards.

728
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:35,210
Let's call her right now.
Let's.

729
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:36,830
Let's tell her the truth
about your boy.

730
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:38,040
You lie for a living,
Annalise,

731
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,000
just like you're lying
about this.

732
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,420
No, I'm being nice
by not going

733
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:42,620
to the FBI
with this information.

734
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:44,790
So not even the police, huh?
You go straight to the FBI?

735
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:46,580
I'm following your lead.

736
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:48,620
You wearing
a wire right now?

737
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:53,500
Because that would be
real bad...

738
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,710
them hearing how your son
slipped your boyfriend

739
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:57,080
the pills
that killed him.

740
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:59,080
That didn't happen.
Because it was you?

741
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,880
Paul overdosed.
Gabriel wanted him to.

742
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,750
And God only knows
what the FBI

743
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:04,790
will do to him
once they find out.

744
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:08,540
They might even decide
he's the bad guy and not me.

745
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:15,210
What's this about?

746
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:17,330
Do you have more information
on Ron's case?

747
00:36:17,330 --> 00:36:19,210
Some.

748
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:22,000
Due to the Governor's
accusations against him

749
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,790
and the suspicions surrounding
his death, my team has been

750
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:26,710
investigating this office
for corruption.

751
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:28,500
I assumed.

752
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:31,380
Really? Then why fabricate
the case file on Vivian Maddox?

753
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:39,710
I'm sorry.

754
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:43,620
I was trying to
find something

755
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:46,000
that might prove Ron
was innocent.

756
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:51,420
And I knew that he was talking
to her son, Gabriel,

757
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:52,830
and so I-I thought
that maybe

758
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:54,620
putting pressure
on his mother...

759
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,540
...would turn up something new.

760
00:36:57,540 --> 00:37:00,750
It was a terrible lapse
in judgement.

761
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:02,040
An illegal one.

762
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,540
Alright. Whatever
you need me to do 

763
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:06,080
There's nothing.

764
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:08,040
Your position at
the District Attorney's office

765
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,170
is terminated.

766
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:13,040
Effective immediately.

767
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,250
Vivian: What do you want
from me, Annalise?

768
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:15,830
Simple. Take your son
and go away.

769
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:17,420
That's all I want, too.

770
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:18,580
Then apologize to him,
because that's what he wants.

771
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:20,000
You're gonna tell me
what he wants?

772
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
I'm telling you
to go home

773
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,210
instead of whatever this is,
because I don't get it,

774
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:25,420
you coming here
to destroy me.

775
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:27,750
Why? Because I stole
your husband 25 years ago?

776
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:28,790
Get over it.

777
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:34,920
You know, I would like
nothing else but to come here

778
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:39,290
and tell you how great
my life's been since Sam,

779
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:41,250
how I was betrayed,
but I stayed strong

780
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:43,460
'cause I'm magic,
how all I had to do

781
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:45,670
was look into my baby boy's eyes
and know I got

782
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:47,210
the better end
of the deal.

783
00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:50,540
But things didn't go
that way for me, Annalise.

784
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:57,790
Sam was the magic.

785
00:37:57,790 --> 00:37:59,210
You felt it, too.

786
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:03,290
A man who not only sees you,
sees the ugliness inside of you,

787
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:07,670
but wants you even more
because of it.

788
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:13,040
Sam wanted me
like I was perfect.

789
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,580
All of me, just perfect.

790
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:21,170
You don't get to feel that
and be okay when it goes away.

791
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:24,330
It's a horrible feeling,
a death.

792
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:25,960
And I blame Sam.
Of course I do.

793
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,830
He's the one
who broke vows.

794
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:32,080
But I blame you, too.

795
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:35,380
I'm sorry.
Oh, shut the hell up.

796
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:40,790
I saw you coming out
of his office.

797
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
And I saw the way
he was looking at you,

798
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,960
smiling, and then I knew
it was you.

799
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,210
The wife.

800
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:52,330
And he gave me
that same look

801
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:55,170
in one of our sessions,
that same smile.

802
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:58,210
And I knew he wanted me.

803
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:03,620
So I let him kiss me.

804
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:05,420
That's the truth,
Vivian.

805
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:09,170
He came after me,
his patient.

806
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:11,580
And God knows
I could have said no,

807
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:16,580
but I needed him to see me
to make myself feel worthy.

808
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:19,620
And now look at us 
two dark-skinned sisters

809
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:22,380
playing out the same story,
giving everything over

810
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:25,790
to a man who sees us
in a world that doesn't.

811
00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:29,210
It's not magic, Vivian.
It's a lie.

812
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:47,670
Hey. I'd like to access
a safe deposit box.

813
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:49,330
Your name?

814
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:50,420
Wes Gibbins.

815
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:09,040
Hey, uh...you have a way
to tell me

816
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,170
who the last person
to access this was?

817
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:15,580
Laurel Castillo.

818
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:17,000
When?

819
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,250
Three days ago.

820
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:34,000
What?
Paul.

821
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:49,880
Did you know?

822
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,120
Know what?

823
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:58,080
My father's dead.

824
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,290
He died in prison
last year.

825
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:03,000
A stroke.

826
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,120
I could have met him
if you'd told me.

827
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:11,380
But he's dead
and it's too late.

828
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:15,120
I was too
late, and it's your fault.

829
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,380
So I hate you.

830
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:18,960
Oh, I hate you.
I hate you so much.

831
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,580
I hate you!

832
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:23,210
I hate you!

833
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:28,420
I hate you.

834
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:31,210
I hate...

835
00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:32,790
I...

836
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:45,670
What is wrong
with you people?

837
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:47,330
I'm about to be a lawyer,
a great one.

838
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:48,420
I know my freaking rights.
Ms. Pratt 

839
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:51,040
I'll sue, starting
with the arresting officer

840
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,460
whose Miranda warning
is defective ab initio.

841
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:57,040
We have a dead informant
on our hands, Michaela.

842
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,670
Your fingerprints match those
on the murder weapon.

843
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:10,540
No more running.

844
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:11,790
It's all over.
