Hi, Sheldon.
I'm so excited for you

160
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,296
to show me around campus today.

161

The only reason
I'm doing it is because...

He's excited to do it,
I'm excited he's doing it.

00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,083
- Are you excited?
- Sure.

Everyone's excited. Yay.

165
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:17,607
[sighs]
Come on, let's go.

166
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:20,275
You and me,
together again.

167
00:06:20,497 --> 00:06:21,892
It just feels right,
doesn't it?

with hair in it.

171

Over there is the quad.
It's a nice place to relax,

the head with Frisbees.

- No, you don't.

You have nothing
to worry about.

I don't want to come
to this school.

176
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,850
I'm just looking at it
to make my mom happy

177
00:06:39,934 --> 00:06:41,200
since it's close to home.

178
00:06:41,341 --> 00:06:42,802
Well, that's wonderful news.

179
00:06:42,887 --> 00:06:45,677
Besides, I've got offers
from way better universities.

180
00:06:45,766 --> 00:06:48,380
What do you mean?
What's wrong with this school?

181
00:06:48,677 --> 00:06:50,530
It's fine.
It's just nowhere near as good

182
00:06:50,615 --> 00:06:52,052
as Harvard or Columbia.

183

It is too.

Yeah.

Okay.

Okay. So,
what are we thinking?

Actually, I don't think
I need a haircut anymore.

318
00:12:05,472 --> 00:12:07,782
Love is a funny thing.

319
00:12:07,872 --> 00:12:10,651
<i>They say, "The heart wants
what the heart wants,"</i>

320
00:12:10,736 --> 00:12:12,517
but I think it should be,

321
00:12:12,601 --> 00:12:16,580
"The limbic system wants
what the limbic system wants."

322
00:12:16,699 --> 00:12:18,908
Finally, someone's making sense.

323
00:12:18,993 --> 00:12:22,972
Well, not to brag, but when
it comes to unrequited love,

324
00:12:23,057 --> 00:12:25,008
I'm kind of an expert.

325
00:12:25,092 --> 00:12:27,881
Well, when I talk to Paige,
all she does is drive me crazy.

326
00:12:27,965 --> 00:12:32,221
There's a thin line between
affection and aggravation.

327
00:12:32,315 --> 00:12:34,691
The Roman poet Catullus said,

328
00:12:34,776 --> 00:12:39,109
"I hate and I love
and I know not why."

329
00:12:39,193 --> 00:12:40,963
I'm not sure
what to make of that.

330
00:12:41,048 --> 00:12:43,243
Perhaps it'd be
more useful in Latin.

331
00:12:43,328 --> 00:12:44,941
"Odi et amo..."

332
00:12:45,025 --> 00:12:47,377
I just want to know
if I have a crush.

333
00:12:47,462 --> 00:12:48,870
Well, does your
heart rate elevate

334
00:12:48,955 --> 00:12:50,479
when you're in her presence?

335
00:12:50,869 --> 00:12:52,159
I suppose.

336
00:12:52,275 --> 00:12:54,236
Does your stomach flutter?

337
00:12:54,382 --> 00:12:56,026
Yes.

338
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:59,908
Sounds like your limbic system
might be doing its thing.

339
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:02,197
Oh, dear.

340
00:13:04,051 --> 00:13:06,073
- Hey.
- Hey.

341
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,588
That's a lot of fabric.

342
00:13:08,673 --> 00:13:10,060
Oh, it's not just fabric.

343
00:13:10,145 --> 00:13:12,979
I also got pattern books
and an accessory kit.

344
00:13:14,608 --> 00:13:16,596
Can I ask how much
that all cost?

345
00:13:16,681 --> 00:13:19,198
Well, it's hard to say,
because in the long run

346
00:13:19,283 --> 00:13:20,585
I'm gonna save us money.

347
00:13:20,744 --> 00:13:23,501
Well, what did it cost
in the short run?

348
00:13:23,585 --> 00:13:25,315
I don't know,
a hundred dollars?

349
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:29,057
A hundred dollars?
What is wrong with you?

350
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:30,799
Why would you say that?

351
00:13:30,884 --> 00:13:32,572
That is a good question.

352
00:13:32,744 --> 00:13:34,518
I mean,
what is wrong with you?

353
00:13:34,893 --> 00:13:36,533
Why is it okay
when you say it?

354
00:13:36,618 --> 00:13:38,980
'Cause clearly there's
something wrong with you.

355
00:13:39,065 --> 00:13:40,729
So you think it's fine
that she spent

356
00:13:40,846 --> 00:13:42,697
a hundred dollars on thread?

357
00:13:42,782 --> 00:13:45,736
I think it's fine that she has
something that makes her happy.

358
00:13:47,842 --> 00:13:48,890
What are you looking for?

359

Look, I get it.

361
00:13:52,856 --> 00:13:56,197
One time, Darlene got all
into scrapbooking.

362
00:13:56,357 --> 00:13:59,102
Overnight, our den became
her scrapbooking room.

363
00:13:59,229 --> 00:14:00,416
What did you do?

364
00:14:00,501 --> 00:14:02,278
I said, "Whatever makes
you happy, dear,"

365
00:14:02,363 --> 00:14:04,499
and made love to her
in the scrapbooking room.

366
00:14:04,684 --> 00:14:05,859
Ha.

367

[exhales]

368
00:14:08,517 --> 00:14:11,132
Maybe if you had three kids,
you'd worry more about money.

369
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:13,439
Oh, we can't wait
to have babies.

370
00:14:13,534 --> 00:14:16,260
I just love the way
their little heads smell.

371
00:14:17,424 --> 00:14:19,819
Does anybody in here
want to be my friend?

372
00:14:20,338 --> 00:14:21,733
Anybody?

373
00:14:22,534 --> 00:14:25,271
Look, Sheldon, you're not gonna
convince me to come here.

374
00:14:25,356 --> 00:14:26,621
You're wasting your time.

[sighs]

379
00:14:34,299 --> 00:14:36,705
I'm a scientist,
and I have to follow the data

00:14:36,789 --> 00:14:39,403
wherever it leads,
whether I like it or not.

381

Get to the point.

382
00:14:42,777 --> 00:14:44,912
It seems
I have a crush on you.

What?

384
00:14:46,477 --> 00:14:48,308
I'm as surprised
as you are.

385
00:14:48,393 --> 00:14:50,761
But I have all the symptoms
according to both Dr. Sturgis

386
00:14:50,846 --> 00:14:53,174
and the editors
of Sassymagazine.

387
00:14:58,846 --> 00:15:00,772
Uh, Sheldon,

388
00:15:01,393 --> 00:15:03,210
I'm really glad
that you told me this,

389
00:15:03,294 --> 00:15:04,877
'cause...

390
00:15:06,063 --> 00:15:08,344
the truth is,
I feel the same way about you.

391

You do?

392
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,572
I mean, I've been
trying to hide it,

Oh, dear.
This is new information.

I had been operating
under the assumption

397
00:15:20,549 --> 00:15:22,098
that my crush was
unrequited.

398
00:15:22,486 --> 00:15:25,799
Oh, it's requited, Sheldon.
It's very requited.

00:15:25,884 --> 00:15:27,320
Hmm.

Well, now we have to kiss.

We do?

the data has led us.

Okay.

Are we kissing?

You bet.

How was that?

I didn't feel anything romantic.

Hmm. Me, either.

415
00:16:15,844 --> 00:16:17,432
I guess it wasn't
a crush after all.
