00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,413
What are you doing here?

3
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:04,564
Apparently,
the head of the college

4
00:00:04,648 --> 00:00:05,657
wants to talk to us.

5
00:00:05,742 --> 00:00:07,566
I'll just get
right to the point.

6
00:00:07,651 --> 00:00:09,177
I would like you
and your son

7
00:00:09,261 --> 00:00:12,102
to meet with a very important
benefactor of the college.

8
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:13,688
Why us?

9
00:00:13,773 --> 00:00:17,054
Sheldon is an impressive addition
to the physics program,

10
00:00:17,139 --> 00:00:20,275
and-and we like our donors
to feel really good

11
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:21,799
about where their money's going.

12
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:23,009
No, thank you.

13
00:00:23,094 --> 00:00:24,446
Can I speak to you alone?

14
00:00:24,531 --> 00:00:25,666
Will you give us a minute?

15
00:00:25,751 --> 00:00:27,539
Very well.
But if you're looking to see

16
00:00:27,624 --> 00:00:29,028
if my father will be
a potential donor,

17
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:31,114
you are barking
up the wrong tree.

18
00:00:35,592 --> 00:00:38,174
<i>People often ask
why I was so resistant</i>

19
00:00:38,259 --> 00:00:39,991

a driver's license.</i>

20
00:00:40,075 --> 00:00:42,260
<i>My spotty history
with motor vehicles</i>

21
00:00:42,345 --> 00:00:43,751
<i>was certainly a factor.</i>

22
00:00:43,836 --> 00:00:45,213
Please slow down.

23
00:00:45,297 --> 00:00:46,824
I'm going eight
miles an hour.

24
00:00:46,908 --> 00:00:48,305
A cow just passed us.

25
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:49,774
You're gonna hit it!

26
00:00:50,322 --> 00:00:51,423
Make it stop!

27
00:00:51,508 --> 00:00:52,599
It's just a car wash.

28
00:00:52,684 --> 00:00:55,254
- Do something!
- It's just a car wash.

29
00:00:55,339 --> 00:00:56,431
We're gonna die!

30
00:00:56,549 --> 00:00:57,751
Just a car wash.

31
00:00:57,843 --> 00:00:59,400
Why did I agree to this?

32
00:00:59,485 --> 00:01:01,836
I don't care for this at all.

33
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:06,211
Oh!

34
00:01:07,826 --> 00:01:09,029
Oh, my God.

35
00:01:10,021 --> 00:01:11,456
Are you okay?

36
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,764
Yes, I think so.

Tow truck's on the way.

46
00:01:36,068 --> 00:01:36,874
You sure

47
00:01:36,958 --> 00:01:37,794
we shouldn't call
an ambulance?

48
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:39,568
I'm fine. Sheldon?

49
00:01:39,653 --> 00:01:40,570
I feel fine.

50
00:01:40,655 --> 00:01:41,716
What happened?

51
00:01:41,801 --> 00:01:43,806
Oh, a cat ran in front of me.

52
00:01:43,921 --> 00:01:45,186
You couldn't stop?

53
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:48,147
I tried,
but the brake just gave out.

54
00:01:48,232 --> 00:01:50,280
Well, thank goodness
it wasn't worse.

55
00:01:50,373 --> 00:01:52,161
I should have
aimed for the cat.

56
00:01:52,246 --> 00:01:54,456
Looks like your car's gonna be
out of commission for a while.

57
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:57,198
If you need a ride, the church
offers a shuttle service.

58
00:01:57,282 --> 00:02:00,071
I'm not getting
on that geezer bus.

59
00:02:00,155 --> 00:02:02,622
It's just for people
who can't get around.

60
00:02:02,707 --> 00:02:04,016
That's 'cause they're
so shriveled up,

61
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,453
they can't even see
over the steering wheel.

62
00:02:06,538 --> 00:02:07,760
That's not nice.

63
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,079
I've driven that van...
It is grim.

64
00:02:10,382 --> 00:02:13,154
If Meemaw doesn't have a car,
who's gonna drive me to college?

65
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:16,202
I guess if we leave early,
I could take you before work.

66
00:02:16,287 --> 00:02:18,419
Hey, when you take the shuttle,
bring hard candy.

67
00:02:18,504 --> 00:02:19,786
They gobble it up.

68
00:02:21,607 --> 00:02:22,920
I can't believe

69
00:02:23,004 --> 00:02:24,529
you and Meemaw
almost died tonight.

70
00:02:24,614 --> 00:02:26,318
I wouldn't say
we almost died.

71
00:02:26,435 --> 00:02:28,144
Well, that's what I'm saying
at school tomorrow.

72
00:02:28,228 --> 00:02:30,799
- Why?
- It's called good storytelling.

73
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:32,513
- But it's lying.
- They don't know that.

74
00:02:32,598 --> 00:02:33,911
You weren't even
in the car.

75
00:02:33,996 --> 00:02:36,444
Doesn't matter.
Shay McElheney's dad

76
00:02:36,529 --> 00:02:39,474
- had a kidney stone...
- she got out of homework for a week.

77
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:41,661
I can't believe you'd use
my traumatic experience

78
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,059
to manipulate people.

79
00:02:43,144 --> 00:02:44,798
Really? I can.

80
00:02:45,857 --> 00:02:47,290
Hey, did the engine catch fire?

81
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:48,224
No!

82
00:02:48,309 --> 00:02:50,037
You're in shock.
You don't know what happened.

83
00:02:50,121 --> 00:02:52,208
I might be a little late
picking you up tonight,

84
00:02:52,293 --> 00:02:53,896
so you can wait in the library.

85
00:02:53,981 --> 00:02:55,630
All right.
I didn't have time

86
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:57,389
To make lunch, so

87
00:02:57,473 --> 00:02:59,826
are you okay...

88
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:03,405
Okay.

89
00:03:03,827 --> 00:03:05,240
What's going on?

90
00:03:05,405 --> 00:03:07,388
I can't do it.
What's wrong?

91
00:03:07,473 --> 00:03:08,935
What if there's another crash?

92
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,677
Baby, that's
not gonna happen again.

93
00:03:11,762 --> 00:03:12,940
You don't know that.

94
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,450
Sheldon,
if you don't get in right now,

95
00:03:15,534 --> 00:03:16,930
you're going
to miss school.

96
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,677
True.

97
00:03:20,302 --> 00:03:21,896
I know you don't
believe in it,

98
00:03:21,981 --> 00:03:24,290
but I'm gonna say an extra
special prayer right now

99
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:25,510
to keep us safe.

100
00:03:25,595 --> 00:03:26,686
Lord,

101
00:03:26,771 --> 00:03:28,272
please look after me
and Sheldon

102
00:03:28,357 --> 00:03:30,378
on our drive to school...

103
00:03:34,204 --> 00:03:35,786
I'll get back to you.

104
00:03:35,898 --> 00:03:38,034
- You see Sheldon?
- T-hat way.

105
00:03:38,478 --> 00:03:39,630
What's going on?

106
00:03:39,715 --> 00:03:42,199
He's having some sort
of panic attack.

107
00:03:42,284 --> 00:03:45,417
Oh, man. My
story just keeps getting better.

108
00:03:52,222 --> 00:03:54,497
Baby, you can't go
the rest of your life

109
00:03:54,582 --> 00:03:56,152
never getting in a car again.

110
00:03:56,237 --> 00:03:59,099
Before cars were invented,
people did it all the time.

111
00:04:01,411 --> 00:04:03,762
Well, I'm not gonna force you.

112
00:04:05,113 --> 00:04:06,708
Thank you.

114
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:18,388
I can't get him in the car.

115
00:04:18,473 --> 00:04:19,433
So what now?

116
00:04:19,518 --> 00:04:21,045
So he's not going to school.

117
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:23,873
You know, on The A-Team,
Mr. T is afraid to fly,

118
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:25,655
and they give him special milk
to put him to sleep.

119
00:04:25,739 --> 00:04:27,222
Ooh. No!

120
00:04:27,307 --> 00:04:28,308
Aw.

121
00:04:29,346 --> 00:04:31,013
I don't care what your guy says.

122
00:04:31,098 --> 00:04:32,926
Have him check it again.

123
00:04:34,729 --> 00:04:35,974
Sorry, I'm cranky.

124
00:04:36,059 --> 00:04:39,497
No problem. I like when you yell
at people who aren't me.

125
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:42,815
Stupid mechanic said
the brakes are just fine.

126
00:04:42,961 --> 00:04:45,227
Well, you probably stepped
on the wrong pedal.

127
00:04:45,312 --> 00:04:46,360
I didn't.

128
00:04:46,445 --> 00:04:47,536
I'm just saying, it happens

129
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:48,812
with people our age, you know.

130
00:04:48,896 --> 00:04:50,596
I've been driving my whole life.

131
00:04:50,681 --> 00:04:52,643
I know which pedal is which.

132
00:04:52,757 --> 00:04:54,802
- Now you're yelling at me.
- Sorry.

133
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:58,294
What do you think about letting
me borrow your truck today?

134
00:04:58,674 --> 00:05:00,592
I don't know.
Why not?

135
00:05:00,778 --> 00:05:02,304
'Cause I like my truck.

136
00:05:02,389 --> 00:05:03,523
Not funny.

137
00:05:03,608 --> 00:05:06,005
It is.
You're just cranky.

138
00:05:06,384 --> 00:05:07,591
Fine.

139
00:05:07,777 --> 00:05:11,566
Maybe I'll just ride my bicycle
to the salon.

140
00:05:11,904 --> 00:05:13,365
You ride a bike?

141
00:05:13,664 --> 00:05:16,104
Is that amusing to you?

142
00:05:16,724 --> 00:05:18,230
An old lady riding a bike?

143
00:05:18,315 --> 00:05:19,293
Oh, no.

144
00:05:21,051 --> 00:05:22,142
Shut up.

145
00:05:22,227 --> 00:05:23,855
Okay, will do.

146
00:05:27,808 --> 00:05:30,161
Oh, my goodness.
Was anyone hurt?

147
00:05:30,245 --> 00:05:33,643
No. But now I got no car
for a while.

148
00:05:33,727 --> 00:05:35,183
You could ride your bike.

149
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:38,698
An old lady on a bike?
That's not cool.

150
00:05:38,783 --> 00:05:41,658
Really? Then I won't ask
how I look on one.

151
00:05:41,995 --> 00:05:43,261
You look great.

152
00:05:43,345 --> 00:05:44,349
I know.

153
00:05:44,433 --> 00:05:46,448
I just wanted
to hear you say it.

154
00:05:47,549 --> 00:05:49,745
So, there's no one
who can lend you a car?

155
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:51,558
There is the church shuttle,

156
00:05:51,658 --> 00:05:55,152
but that just feels like
it's the end of the line.

157
00:05:55,387 --> 00:05:57,044
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

158
00:05:57,316 --> 00:06:00,848
There's all sorts of
depressing steps before the end.

159
00:06:00,887 --> 00:06:02,283
You've got full-time

160
00:06:02,368 --> 00:06:03,633
nursing care.

161
00:06:03,718 --> 00:06:04,635
Bye, John.

162
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,290
Assisted living.

163
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:08,115
- Bye, John.
- Hospice.

164
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,205
- Bye, John.
- Life support.

165
00:06:10,492 --> 00:06:11,583
Bye, John!

166
00:06:11,668 --> 00:06:13,760
Pulling the plug.

167
00:06:13,845 --> 00:06:15,589
- Bye, John.
- Then...

168
00:06:15,674 --> 00:06:18,157
you make
a miraculous recovery!

169
00:06:18,242 --> 00:06:20,123
- Great!
- But...

170
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:21,560
the hospital bills

171
00:06:21,653 --> 00:06:24,050
- leave you destitute!
- Bye.

172
00:06:24,289 --> 00:06:25,638
Bye.

173
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:31,631
Grant Linkletter.

174
00:06:31,716 --> 00:06:33,111
Dr. Linkletter,
Sheldon Cooper.

175
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:35,656
I wanted to let you know
I won't be in class today.

176
00:06:35,741 --> 00:06:37,398
- Is everything all right?
<i>- Yes,</i>

177
00:06:37,483 --> 00:06:39,013
but in the interest
of self-preservation,

178
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:42,109
I've decided to avoid traveling
in motor vehicles.

179
00:06:42,327 --> 00:06:44,359
I'm sure there's a story
behind that.

180
00:06:44,444 --> 00:06:46,232
- There is.
- I don't want to hear it.

181
00:06:46,317 --> 00:06:48,632
So, how shall we handle
today's class?

182
00:06:48,717 --> 00:06:50,995
Well, I'm sure you can get notes
from another student.

183
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,129
Or you could give the lecture
to me right now.

184
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:54,875
That's preposterous.

185
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,195
Why? We could be creating
a new model of education

186
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,905
where students
could learn remotely.

187
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:01,734
It could be the wave
of the future.

188
00:07:01,898 --> 00:07:03,611
Sheldon,
it's your responsibility

189
00:07:03,696 --> 00:07:06,030
to come to class,
not mine to bring the class to you.

190
00:07:06,115 --> 00:07:08,570
My meemaw gets cranky like this
when she's hungover.

191
00:07:08,655 --> 00:07:10,178
Is that what's happening here?

192
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:15,482
First Baptist of Medford.
How may I bless you?

193
00:07:15,567 --> 00:07:17,833
I thought Peg answered
the phones.

194
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:18,951
Mom?

195
00:07:19,036 --> 00:07:20,005
Yeah.

196
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:21,921
Something I can help you with?

197
00:07:22,373 --> 00:07:23,920
No, it can wait.

198
00:07:24,005 --> 00:07:26,573
You want the number
to the shuttle, don't you?

199
00:07:27,284 --> 00:07:28,506
Yes.

200
00:07:28,591 --> 00:07:30,376
Let me get that for you.

201
00:07:32,153 --> 00:07:35,948
Huh. Um, looking under "G"
for "geezer bus,"

202
00:07:36,033 --> 00:07:37,451
and it's not there.

203
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,935
Oh, that's hilarious.

204
00:07:39,066 --> 00:07:41,614
Maybe it's under "O"
for "old fogies."

205
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:44,685
You know, you're not being a
very Christian person right now.

206
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:47,515
I have enough prayers in
the bank, I can coast for a day.

207
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,065
Just give me the number!

208
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:51,938
All right.
Now, remember when you call

209
00:07:52,023 --> 00:07:54,545
to let them know if you need
any help getting up stairs.

210
00:07:54,721 --> 00:07:56,947
<i>Dr. Linkletter
wouldn't give me what I wanted.</i>

211
00:07:57,031 --> 00:07:58,788
<i>I couldn't tell on him
to his mommy,</i>

212
00:07:58,873 --> 00:08:00,420
<i>but I could to his "work mommy."</i>

213
00:08:00,505 --> 00:08:02,162
Sheldon.
What can I do for you?

214
00:08:02,247 --> 00:08:04,120
I can't make it to school today,
and I'm concerned

215
00:08:04,204 --> 00:08:05,601
about the physics class
I'm missing.

216
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:06,950
And how come you're not here?

217
00:08:07,171 --> 00:08:09,176
I was in a car accident
with my meemaw.

218
00:08:09,261 --> 00:08:10,874
Oh, my God.
Are you okay?

219
00:08:10,966 --> 00:08:11,885
Well...

220
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:13,758
I can't believe you'd use
my traumatic experience

221
00:08:13,842 --> 00:08:15,194
to manipulate people.

222
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:17,299
Really? I can.

223
00:08:17,422 --> 00:08:19,470
...and then her car
had to get towed away.

224
00:08:19,554 --> 00:08:21,736
It was quite
a traumatic experience.

225
00:08:21,821 --> 00:08:22,825
Oh, you poor thing.

226
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,915
What can I do to help?

227
00:08:25,268 --> 00:08:27,752
If you turn
to page 78 in the textbook,

228
00:08:27,837 --> 00:08:29,363
I'll begin today's lecture.

229
00:08:29,648 --> 00:08:32,091
We should come up
with some kind of video system

230
00:08:32,176 --> 00:08:33,814
so you can see
when I raise my hand.

231
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:35,352
Why don't you just tell me?

232
00:08:35,437 --> 00:08:37,268
Let's try it. Hand-raise.

233
00:08:37,554 --> 00:08:39,167
Yes, Sheldon.

234
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:41,124
That worked great.

235
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,315
Hey, Connie.
Waiting for the mail?

236
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,417
- Yeah.
- You know me.Yeah.

237
00:08:47,502 --> 00:08:48,288
Oh.

238
00:08:48,373 --> 00:08:50,117
Something
from Publishers Clearing House.

239
00:08:50,202 --> 00:08:51,393
Maybe you won.

240
00:08:51,478 --> 00:08:53,352
- Yeah, wouldn't that be something?
- Yeah.

241
00:08:53,437 --> 00:08:54,330
You know,
people think

242
00:08:54,415 --> 00:08:56,518
Publishers Clearing House
is Ed McMahon,

243
00:08:56,603 --> 00:08:58,216
but that's actually
a different company.

244
00:08:58,301 --> 00:08:59,229
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

245
00:08:59,314 --> 00:09:01,487
Publishers Clearing House
is the Prize Patrol

246
00:09:01,572 --> 00:09:02,775
with the giant check.

247
00:09:02,859 --> 00:09:03,994
Ed McMahon...

248
00:09:04,079 --> 00:09:06,694
Well, it sure is nice talking
to you, Edwin. Bye.

249
00:09:06,819 --> 00:09:07,908
Oh.

250
00:09:07,994 --> 00:09:09,580
The church van.
My grandma

251
00:09:09,665 --> 00:09:11,041
- rides that sometimes.
- Edwin.

252
00:09:11,126 --> 00:09:12,541
- Hmm?
- Beat it.

253
00:09:12,674 --> 00:09:13,885
All right. Yep.

254
00:09:14,064 --> 00:09:16,440
One can choose
the extended-zone scheme,

255
00:09:16,525 --> 00:09:17,908
the reduced-zone scheme
or the...

256
00:09:17,993 --> 00:09:19,252
- Hand-raise.
- Yes?

257
00:09:19,337 --> 00:09:20,820
I set you up
on speakerphone,

258
00:09:20,905 --> 00:09:23,127
so now it's really like
I'm learning in the future.

259
00:09:23,212 --> 00:09:24,377
May I continue?

260
00:09:24,469 --> 00:09:26,044
Ahead warp factor five.

261
00:09:26,129 --> 00:09:28,752
That's from Star Trek,
which is also in the future.

262
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,753
- Connie Tucker?
- Yeah.

263
00:09:31,838 --> 00:09:33,278
Give me one second.
I'll help you in.

264
00:09:33,362 --> 00:09:36,080
No, no, I don't need your help.
I can get it myself.

265
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:40,244
She opened that
door by herself.

266
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:42,117
Looks like we got
a feisty one.

267
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:44,081
Don't test me.

268
00:09:44,648 --> 00:09:46,979
- Oh, yeah, she's feisty.
- What?

269
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,871
- She's feisty!
- She's feisty!

270
00:09:51,812 --> 00:09:53,465
What?

271
00:10:00,786 --> 00:10:02,172
Vern.

272
00:10:02,968 --> 00:10:04,079
Connie.

273
00:10:04,164 --> 00:10:05,910
Where you headed, Connie?

274
00:10:06,017 --> 00:10:07,337
Stop flirting with her.

275
00:10:07,422 --> 00:10:09,719
I'm not flirting with her.
I was being cordial.

276
00:10:09,803 --> 00:10:11,705
Mm-hmm.
I'm Hortense,

277
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:14,836
his wife, which, clearly,
he seems to have forgotten.

278
00:10:14,921 --> 00:10:16,796
Judas Priest, give it a rest.

279
00:10:17,028 --> 00:10:18,166
That's Doris.

280
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:19,947
Hello, Doris.
What?

281
00:10:20,093 --> 00:10:22,095
Turn on your hearing aid.

282
00:10:23,481 --> 00:10:24,833
It's nice to meet y'all.

283
00:10:24,918 --> 00:10:27,750
And to answer your question,
I'm headed to the salon.

284
00:10:27,865 --> 00:10:29,739
Oh, fancy.

285
00:10:30,157 --> 00:10:32,454
We're headed to the pharmacy.

286
00:10:33,784 --> 00:10:35,805
Seven pills a day.

287
00:10:35,907 --> 00:10:39,184
You take nine...
Clearly one ain't working.

288
00:10:39,268 --> 00:10:41,422
Okay, I'm on. What'd I miss?

289
00:10:41,594 --> 00:10:43,666
She's headed to the salon!

290
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:45,976
Ooh, fancy.

291
00:10:57,696 --> 00:10:58,855
Cooper residence.

292
00:10:58,939 --> 00:11:01,423
Sheldon,
President Hagemeyer again.

293
00:11:01,507 --> 00:11:04,687
Just calling to make sure it all
worked out with Dr. Linkletter.

294
00:11:04,771 --> 00:11:06,446
Yes, everything went quite well.

295
00:11:06,672 --> 00:11:08,353
Although he was a tad irritable.

296
00:11:08,438 --> 00:11:10,824
Maybe because I ripped him
a new one.

297
00:11:10,908 --> 00:11:13,000
- A new what?
- Ot important.

298
00:11:13,084 --> 00:11:15,176
Uh, whatever you need
for classes,

299
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,656
you just say the word.

300
00:11:16,954 --> 00:11:18,994
I suppose it could be helpful
if I could dial

301
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:20,822
into the university's server
while still

302
00:11:20,907 --> 00:11:22,548
on the phone with my professors.

303
00:11:22,633 --> 00:11:24,120
Like a second phone line?

304
00:11:24,205 --> 00:11:25,557
We can take care of that.

305
00:11:25,642 --> 00:11:26,951
Well, as my meemaw would say,

306
00:11:27,035 --> 00:11:29,301
"Aren't you
just a spoonful of sugar?"

307
00:11:31,093 --> 00:11:33,739
Who is he talking to
all this time?

308
00:11:33,824 --> 00:11:36,563
And if there's anything else
you need, you just let me know.

309
00:11:36,648 --> 00:11:38,479
I can't think of anything
except that I wanted

310
00:11:38,571 --> 00:11:40,315
Strawberry Quik
and my brother put the empty

311
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,318
milk carton back in the fridge.

312
00:11:42,403 --> 00:11:44,146
Ah, brothers, they're the worst.

313
00:11:44,231 --> 00:11:46,411
Mine's an environmental
activist.

314
00:11:48,584 --> 00:11:50,110
And then they crashed
into a tree.

315
00:11:50,195 --> 00:11:52,287
Oh, no! The engine caught fire.

316
00:11:52,401 --> 00:11:54,058
My goodness, is everyone okay?

317
00:11:54,143 --> 00:11:55,321
Thankfully, yes.

318
00:11:55,406 --> 00:11:57,243
But I was pretty shook up.

319
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,258
Well, don't worry
about that test today.

320
00:12:00,868 --> 00:12:02,400
Thank you for understanding.

321
00:12:02,485 --> 00:12:03,988
Mm-hmm.

322
00:12:04,072 --> 00:12:06,680
Oh, and where are we
on homework tonight?

323
00:12:06,765 --> 00:12:08,509
- Don't push it.
- Right.

324
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:11,200
Hey, I'm just gonna run Doris
into the bank.

325
00:12:11,285 --> 00:12:12,722
We'll be back in a minute.

326
00:12:13,734 --> 00:12:15,173
Doris. Whoa.

327
00:12:15,257 --> 00:12:17,567
You seem like
you can get around,

328
00:12:17,651 --> 00:12:20,526
so why are you
in this geezer-buggy?

329
00:12:20,854 --> 00:12:22,572
I had a little car accident.

330
00:12:22,656 --> 00:12:24,704
Oh, no.Ooh.
Anybody get hurt?

331
00:12:24,807 --> 00:12:26,271
Only the tree.

332
00:12:26,355 --> 00:12:27,604
Step on the wrong pedal?

333
00:12:27,689 --> 00:12:29,346
No.

334
00:12:29,561 --> 00:12:30,956
Maybe.

335
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,339
Maybe, my ass.

336
00:12:32,424 --> 00:12:34,246
Hey, that sort of thing happens.

337
00:12:34,331 --> 00:12:35,479
Oh.

338
00:12:35,564 --> 00:12:37,874
He drove
into all kinds of stuff

339
00:12:37,959 --> 00:12:39,398
before they took his keys away.

340
00:12:39,483 --> 00:12:40,792
Remember the goose?

341
00:12:40,877 --> 00:12:42,795
Ooh. Feathers everywhere.

342
00:12:43,024 --> 00:12:44,855
Huh. I just think it'd kill me

343
00:12:44,939 --> 00:12:46,628
to lose my independence
like that.

344
00:12:46,713 --> 00:12:47,789
Oh, it's not so bad.

345
00:12:48,115 --> 00:12:50,557
Sometimes Clayton takes us
to the park.

346
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:51,872
Like dogs.

347
00:12:51,957 --> 00:12:53,550
I got places to go...

348
00:12:53,723 --> 00:12:55,424
Bowling league,
water aerobics,

349
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:56,932
I drive my grandson to college.

350
00:12:57,017 --> 00:12:58,544
Why can't he drive himself?

351
00:12:58,629 --> 00:13:00,136
Well, he's 11.

352
00:13:00,221 --> 00:13:02,589
Wha...?
11 and in college?

353
00:13:02,674 --> 00:13:03,831
He's special.

354
00:13:03,923 --> 00:13:06,668
Our grandson is 27.

355
00:13:06,877 --> 00:13:09,823
Mm, he may be
the other kind of special.

356
00:13:18,578 --> 00:13:19,931
Sheldon?

357
00:13:20,016 --> 00:13:22,192
In my room.

358
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:24,445
I saw a truck outside.

359
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:25,925
What's wrong
with the phone?

360
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:27,667
Nothing.
Oh.

361
00:13:27,752 --> 00:13:29,235
Adding a second line.

362
00:13:29,505 --> 00:13:30,640
I'm almost done here.

363
00:13:30,724 --> 00:13:32,076
Just got to hop up on the roof.

364
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,393
Hold on. You can't just
add another phone line

365
00:13:35,478 --> 00:13:36,550
without asking.

366
00:13:36,635 --> 00:13:38,243
I didn't do it.
The university did.

367
00:13:38,328 --> 00:13:40,866
- Why would they do that?
- I asked them to.

368
00:13:40,951 --> 00:13:42,739
Are you some sort
of special kid?

369
00:13:42,823 --> 00:13:44,436
You have no idea.

370
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,565
Shouldn't you be up on the roof?

371
00:13:47,729 --> 00:13:50,953
You can't just ask
the university for things.

372
00:13:51,092 --> 00:13:53,140
President Hagemeyer seemed
so happy to help.

373
00:13:53,224 --> 00:13:54,577
Why rob her of that?

374
00:13:54,661 --> 00:13:56,753
Sheldon, you are going to have

375
00:13:56,837 --> 00:13:58,624
to get in a car again
eventually.

376
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:00,147
It's not looking like it.

377
00:14:01,752 --> 00:14:03,754
This isn't over.

378
00:14:05,366 --> 00:14:06,784
Can I help you?

379
00:14:06,869 --> 00:14:09,222
- Grocery delivery for Sheldon Cooper?
- What is it?

380
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:12,737
Looks like milk, straws and
three cans of Strawberry Quik.

381
00:14:12,822 --> 00:14:14,348
Oh, boy.

382
00:14:14,672 --> 00:14:15,672
Thank you.

383
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,295
Would you tip him?

384
00:14:17,379 --> 00:14:18,690
I'm a little light.

385
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:20,645
So, I was singing

386
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:22,430
karaoke with
my girlfriend

387
00:14:22,514 --> 00:14:25,253
who used to be married to
the guy I'm currently dating.

388
00:14:25,338 --> 00:14:27,474
What the heck is a karaoke?

389
00:14:27,688 --> 00:14:29,222
It's when you stand up and sing

390
00:14:29,307 --> 00:14:30,869
in front of everybody
at the bar.

391
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:32,655
You're like a Las Vegas showgirl.

392
00:14:32,739 --> 00:14:34,854
Oh, no, no,
anybody can do it.

393
00:14:34,939 --> 00:14:37,423
- I'll take you sometime.
- Oh, please. Can we?

394
00:14:37,508 --> 00:14:40,078
Well, could I sing
"Blue Suede Shoes"?

395
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:43,434
You bet. You better turn your hearing aid
down for that one.

396
00:14:43,605 --> 00:14:44,653
You got that right.

397
00:14:45,066 --> 00:14:46,543
Tell me,
when was the last time

398
00:14:46,628 --> 00:14:48,903
you went and got all
dolled up at a salon?

399
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:50,637
I don't even remember.

400
00:14:50,729 --> 00:14:52,037
It's been years.

401
00:14:52,122 --> 00:14:53,997
Does it look like
I go to a salon?

402
00:14:54,082 --> 00:14:55,278
We're going now.

403
00:14:55,363 --> 00:14:58,075
I'm gonna take you,
and it's on me.

404
00:14:58,249 --> 00:14:59,989
This is exciting.

405
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,817
It's a good thing
I got my heart pills.

406
00:15:04,785 --> 00:15:05,746
Hello.

407
00:15:05,866 --> 00:15:08,137
Hi. This is Linda Hagemeyer
from the university.

408
00:15:08,222 --> 00:15:09,878
Is this Mrs. Cooper?

409
00:15:10,006 --> 00:15:11,402
- Yes, it is.
- Excellent.

410
00:15:11,487 --> 00:15:13,629
Did the Strawberry Quik arrive?

411
00:15:13,714 --> 00:15:15,328
As a matter of fact,
it did.

412
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:17,680
Sounds like nasty stuff,
but, hey,

413
00:15:17,765 --> 00:15:20,031
whatever floats
the little guy's boat, right?

414
00:15:20,116 --> 00:15:23,905
Listen, I appreciate that you
value Sheldon at your school.

415
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:26,996
Love him.
But I am trying to raise him

416
00:15:27,081 --> 00:15:31,161
to be a well-rounded individual
who will get in a car.

417
00:15:31,246 --> 00:15:32,817
Oh, I wouldn't worry about that.

418
00:15:32,902 --> 00:15:35,559
Academia draws all kinds
of eccentrics.

419
00:15:36,074 --> 00:15:37,818
Yeah, we've got
a biology professor

420
00:15:37,926 --> 00:15:39,931
who hasn't cut his nails
in years.

421
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:42,114
Ugh. Looks like
Edward Scissorhands.

422
00:15:42,199 --> 00:15:44,668
That is not what I want
for my son.

423
00:15:47,035 --> 00:15:48,371
Do you have children?

424
00:15:48,456 --> 00:15:50,648
No, but thanks
for bringing it up.

425
00:15:50,733 --> 00:15:54,479
Anyway, I would like Sheldon
to function in society,

426
00:15:54,563 --> 00:15:58,364
and it does not help if you give
him everything that he asks for.

427
00:15:58,449 --> 00:16:00,262
I'm just doing my job.

428
00:16:01,282 --> 00:16:03,825
And I am just doing mine.

429
00:16:05,323 --> 00:16:06,519
Understood.

430
00:16:06,604 --> 00:16:07,608
Thank you.

431
00:16:08,153 --> 00:16:10,153
Oh, and, um, in a few minutes,

432
00:16:10,238 --> 00:16:12,635
my assistant is gonna be
dropping off a big old basket

433
00:16:12,793 --> 00:16:14,614
of Star Trektapes.

434
00:16:14,699 --> 00:16:17,614
I'm afraid it's too late for me
to pump the brakes on that one.

435
00:16:17,707 --> 00:16:19,625
<i>♪ Whoa!</i>

436
00:16:28,205 --> 00:16:31,159
- Sarah did a real nice job on my cuticles.
- Yeah.

437
00:16:31,244 --> 00:16:33,198
So where we headed next?
And don't say dinner.

438
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:35,033
Oh, but it's almost 4:00.

439
00:16:35,118 --> 00:16:37,582
- What?!
- It's almost 4:00.

440
00:16:37,667 --> 00:16:38,932
Ooh, dinnertime.

441
00:16:39,017 --> 00:16:41,088
Just get in.

442
00:16:41,213 --> 00:16:44,455
Ooh. She's like
a muscle man.

443
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:48,924
- Move on over, Doris.
- What?

444
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:54,867
<i>My mother eventually coaxed me</i>

445
00:16:54,951 --> 00:16:57,405
<i>back into a car
with a trip to RadioShack.</i>

446
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:58,904
<i>She knew I was nervous</i>

447
00:16:58,989 --> 00:17:01,473
<i>so she came up with
an interesting distraction.</i>

448
00:17:01,654 --> 00:17:03,922
Baby, how about
we play a car game?

449
00:17:04,007 --> 00:17:07,317
I suppose.
Can I make it science-based?

450
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:10,104
Sure. I'll say an element
starting with "A,"

451
00:17:10,203 --> 00:17:12,730
then you repeat that
and add one starting with "B."

452
00:17:12,838 --> 00:17:14,843
- I don't think I'll get very far.
- Great.

453
00:17:14,928 --> 00:17:16,323
Then I'll win.
Aluminum.

454
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:20,887
Okay, uh, you said
"A" for aluminum.

455
00:17:21,341 --> 00:17:25,192
- "B." Is boron an element?
- Yes.

456
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:27,437
<i>It was
the beginning of a new tradition.</i>

457
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:30,764
<i>One that would eventually
bring countless hours of joy</i>

458
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:32,724
<i>to Leonard
on our drives to work.</i>

459
00:17:32,809 --> 00:17:35,497
<i>Much like my mother,
he never beat me.</i>

460
00:17:36,199 --> 00:17:38,291
I don't know an element
that starts with "D."

461
00:17:38,376 --> 00:17:40,033
I win. That was fun.

462
00:17:40,134 --> 00:17:42,049
Round two.
Argon.
