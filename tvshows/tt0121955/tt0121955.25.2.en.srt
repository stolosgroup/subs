As farmers
and cultivators of marijuana,

12
00:00:48,923 --> 00:00:51,342
we have a responsibility
to society...

13
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:54,262
I know we all respect
the crop here,

14
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:56,181
and we seek each day
to better understand

15
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:58,725
the nuances and legitimacy
of its uses.

16
00:00:58,808 --> 00:01:01,394
Let's go weed! Wew!

17
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:04,522
But we growers must face
a harsh reality...

18
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:08,193
Since the legalization of
marijuana, communities of color,

19
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:10,153
black and brown Coloradans,

20
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:12,864
those most affected
by the racist war on drugs,

21
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:15,909
have now been locked out of the
wealth creation of the industry.

22
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:22,665
Luckily, the public is starting
to understand this unfairness...

23
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:24,209
And many people are now talking

24
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:27,462
of boycotting cannabis growers
who are only white owned.

25
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:29,631
Boycotting what?
Wait... What?

26
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:33,218
We are seeing a healthy
and dramatic spike in consumers

27
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:35,762
who demand that their marijuana
be grown

28
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:38,306
by those who understand
the fight for social equity.

29
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:40,475
Ugh ahhug...

30
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:42,018
The bottom line is this...

31
00:01:42,101 --> 00:01:44,854
A completely white owned
weed business these days...

32
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,773
just isn't going to survive.

33
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:58,701
Guys... I wanna have kind of
a tough talk with you.

34
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:02,664
We don't really have
any black friends,

35
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:05,500
we don't reach out
to the black community.

36
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:09,712
Shelley you never bring
any black dudes over.

37
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:13,341
I mean, Stan, your three
best friends are all white.

38
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:15,760
There's only one black kid
in my whole class.

39
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:16,886
Yes, that kid Token.

40
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,972
How come you never hang out
with him?

41
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:20,265
I do hang out with him.

42
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:22,308
In a group maybe
but I don't recall

43
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:25,061
just you and Token
ever doing anything.

44
00:02:25,144 --> 00:02:27,730
I've never seen Token
here at the farm

45
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,774
just like the two of you guys.

46
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:30,733
Why not?

47
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:33,444
I... I don't know.

48
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:35,738
Randy, stop, we're not racists.

49
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:38,032
We'd like to think that
wouldn't we?

50
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:41,286
But... actions speak louder
than words, gang.

51
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:42,662
I guess...

52
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:45,373
I guess I just want you
to think about it.

53
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:01,869
Uh hey Token.

54
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:03,141
Oh hey Stan.

55
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:05,393
Uh listen, I uh...

56
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:07,020
How're ya doin?

57
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:08,897
Fine.

58
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,816
Um... You think your family would
wanna come over for dinner?

59
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,401
Out at our farm?

60
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:14,903
It's kind of far isn't it?

61
00:03:14,904 --> 00:03:16,321
Yeah but...

62
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:19,574
Look, Token, I think maybe you
and I should hang out more.

63
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:20,992
What are you talking about?

64
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:23,745
I mean we never just hang out,
you and me.

65
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:26,372
Hey we never hang out
just you and me either, Stan!

66
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:27,456
Shut up, Butters.

67
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:28,917
Look, just will you please
just see

68
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,793
if your family
will come over for dinner?

69
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:33,212
It would mean a lot.

70
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,593
Okay, there we go.

71
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:40,470
That is a farm fresh hemp salad

72
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,388
sourced locally here at Tegridy!

73
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,933
Alright, come on, everybody,
dig in.

74
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:47,435
Thank you so much
for having us over.

75
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:48,811
This is really nice.

76
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,856
We've never been
to a marijuana farm before.

77
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,484
Well, you know, with our boys
starting to become so close...

78
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:56,736
We thought we better get
the families together!

79
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:58,821
If they're friends
then we need to be friends! Huh?

80
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,406
Do you mind if I post this?

81
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,617
Check out our friends!

82
00:04:06,245 --> 00:04:10,208
Randy... I hope you didn't invite
us here because we're black.

83
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,377
W-What are you talking about?

84
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,780
It's just that
the past year or so

85
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:16,130
a lot of people have been
inviting us over to dinner

86
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:20,176
and then taking pictures of us
to show everyone on Instagram.

87
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:22,887
Oh, that's so lame.

88
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:25,765
No, we really just wanted
to get to know you guys better

89
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:27,767
since Stan is friends
with Token.

90
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:30,395
You know...
Just out of curiosity...

91
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:32,522
Why did you guys name him that?

92
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:34,774
What do you mean?

93
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:39,028
Well... I mean, it's just
kind of an odd name, isn't it?

94
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,780
Like, some people might think

95
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:43,449
you guys naming your son that
isn't very cool.

96
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:45,410
People have a problem
with Tolkien's name?

97
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:48,413
Well, I mean other people
just think it's a little...

98
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:50,623
I mean, come on, I mean, I'm...

99
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:53,501
I'm not calling you guys racist,
but...

100
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:55,336
Why did you name your son that?

101
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,296
My husband has always been
a huge fan

102
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,382
of "Lord of The Rings"
and "The Hobbit."

103
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:03,553
I wanted to name my son
after my favorite author.

104
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,638
But she didn't want
to name our son J.R.R.,

105
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:08,182
so we just named him Tolkien.

106
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:12,103
His name is Tolkien?

107
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:13,896
Yes, you know
his name is Tolkien.

108
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,482
- I thought your name was Token.
- My name is Tolkien.

109
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,067
Sorry, I don't think
it's that weird.

110
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:19,902
J.R.R. Tolkien is one of
the most prolific,

111
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,696
influential writers of our time.

112
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:23,906
Holy shit,
that's what his name means?

113
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,867
What did you think
his name meant?

114
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:30,663
Would you like to see how we
grow and process our weed?

115
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:35,084
You see,
it's all about refinement.

116
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,128
Here at Tegridy,
we believe the best weed

117
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:38,796
is untouched from the earth...

118
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,841
So we distill it down
to its basic essence.

119
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:43,426
Over there
are our clean out vats

120
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,803
and up here we have
our first stage drying racks.

121
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:47,409
Oh, real quick!

122
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,266
It all takes about six days

123
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:52,518
from the field to a jar
that we can sell.

124
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,270
So... What do you think?

125
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:57,440
It's... uh, very involved.

126
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:59,650
Yeah. It takes a lot.

127
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:02,236
You know...
I just had a crazy idea...

128
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,113
Our boys are best friends now...

129
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,199
Why don't you come work
for Tegridy?

130
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:07,492
Randy, I have a job.

131
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:09,786
I'm a very successful
co-executive

132
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,746
of a financial consulting firm.

133
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:14,540
Oh my gosh... I was just saying
we could really use

134
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:17,210
a co-executive
of financial consulting!

135
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:18,586
Look, I...

136
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:20,588
Would it be okay if...

137
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,590
If I sent you
some of our receipts

138
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:24,801
and you could help us
financial consult?

139
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:27,178
That's what we do...
Sure.

140
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:28,638
Oh, my God, this is amazing.

141
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:31,557
Here's to the start
of something wonderful.

142
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,267
Would you like some free weed?

143
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:34,811
No.

144
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:42,944
Hey, Stan.

145
00:06:44,403 --> 00:06:46,823
Dude... My head is reeling,
you're not gonna believe this.

146
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,324
Not gonna believe what?

147
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:52,161
Token's name isn't Token.
It's Tolkien.

148
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,122
Yeah, I know it's Tolkien.

149
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:55,957
No, no, no, no.
He's named after the guy

150
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,625
who wrote "The Hobbit"
and stuff!

151
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,418
Yeah, I know.
J.R.R. Tolkien.

152
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:01,212
What did you think it was?

153
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,590
You knew it was Tolkien
like the writer.

154
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:05,967
Everyone knew it was Tolkien.

155
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,635
No, no, no!
No, no, no, no!

156
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:10,054
I distinctly remember Cartman
wearing a shirt

157
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:11,722
where he spelled it T-o-k-e-n.

158
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:13,850
Yeah, dude,
cuz Cartman's a fuckin' moron.

159
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:16,144
Wha... Hold on a second!

160
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:24,026
Whatsup, dog.

161
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,445
Dude, Cartman, did you know
that Tolkien is named

162
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:27,446
after J.R.R. Tolkien?

163
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,490
Well, yeah, I just figured.

164
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:32,618
Then why did you spell it Token
without the "L" or the "I"?!

165
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:35,163
J.R.R. Tolkien has an "L" in it?
That's gay.

166
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:37,331
Who did you think Tolkien
was named after?

167
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,251
Stan? You out here?

168
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:43,588
Uh, yeah,
hang on a second Tol-kien,

169
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:45,548
just taking a shit.

170
00:07:45,549 --> 00:07:47,425
Oh, okay, sorry.

171
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:50,678
Oh, my God...
I suck...

172
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:05,151
This is your mornin' commute,
South Park.

173
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:07,904
Looks like we have a bit
of slowing heading into town.

174
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,823
There's like a truck
and a couple cars...

175
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:12,992
maybe take ya
a couple minutes there.

176
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:15,012
Also, if you're heading
out of town on the main road

177
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:18,122
there's a... there's, like,
a car there, too.

178
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:19,457
What the fuck?

179
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,083
Now let's look at the weather.

180
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,418
Weather's looking like

181
00:08:22,501 --> 00:08:23,812
we're gonna have a little bit
of snow.

182
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,567
And the, uh... the...

183
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:32,094
What the hell are you doing?

184
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,347
Taking shit tons
of Tegridy orders.

185
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:36,265
Sales are going nuts right now.

186
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:39,101
No... why is my face
on a billboard?!

187
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,896
Because we work together.

188
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:44,690
You said you just needed someone
to help with accounting!

189
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:47,485
Yes, but then...
You got promoted!

190
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:49,695
I was gonna surprise you.

191
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,781
Don't you see how lucrative
this can be?

192
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:54,617
I mean, we make a pretty damn
good team in the weed business.

193
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,536
I mean, we are Ben and Jerry...

194
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,288
We're Ben and Jerry.

195
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,061
You're Jerry, and I'm Ben.

196
00:09:01,062 --> 00:09:02,750
I thought I was Jerry.

197
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,544
No, you're a towel.

198
00:09:04,545 --> 00:09:06,254
Oh, that's even better.

199
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:08,506
I told you before
that I'm not interested

200
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:09,799
in the marijuana business.

201
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:12,343
I don't believe in drinking
or doing drugs.

202
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:13,970
Doing dru... Do you remember

203
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:17,265
when Bilbo first set out
with the dwarves to fight Smaug.

204
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:19,517
What's the first thing
they all did?

205
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,935
They partied their asses off.

206
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:22,687
♪ Chip the glasses,
click the plates ♪

207
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,106
♪ That's what Bilbo Baggins
hates ♪

208
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:30,361
And then they certainly had an
adventure together, didn't they?

209
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:33,739
Filled with...
lucrative treasure.

210
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:38,286
You really think we could make
a lot of money together?

211
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:40,413
Ben and Jerry, my man.

212
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:43,040
Ben and fuckin' Jerry.

213
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,843
Hey-hey!
Stan the man!

214
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:55,240
How ya doing, buddy?

215
00:09:55,241 --> 00:09:56,554
Okay, I guess...

216
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:59,223
The nurse said you came here
by yourself. No parents?

217
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:01,851
I... kinda wanted to talk about
something in private.

218
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:03,602
Oh, okay, pal...
What is it?

219
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:07,690
I think...
I might be horribly racist.

220
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,651
Well, kiddo...
You don't normally go

221
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:12,903
to a doctor's office
for feeling racist,

222
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:14,238
but tell me what happened.

223
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:18,409
So... there's this kid
at my school and... he's black.

224
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:20,328
And his parents named him
after the guy

225
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:21,287
that wrote "Lord of the Rings."

226
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:23,414
Uh-huh, Tolkien.
Great name.

227
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:26,125
Yeah... well I-I thought
his name was Token.

228
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,627
Like... Like a black kid
that's just there

229
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:31,255
so that... like...
there's a black kid.

230
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:34,342
Uh huh... and how long
have you thought that?

231
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:35,634
The whole time!

232
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:36,998
I've thought that
the whole time.

233
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:39,847
Wow...

234
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,058
Fuck you.
Huh?

235
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:44,352
You really thought
a couple of black people

236
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:46,479
had a child and named him Token?

237
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:48,606
Why would anyone
name a black kid Token?

238
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:49,899
You're a piece of shit.

239
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,108
No, I was just try...

240
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:52,526
You were just going along

241
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,528
with the dominant culture
of the white paradigm,

242
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:55,863
that's what you were just...

243
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:57,615
Get out of my office,
you make me sick!

244
00:10:57,698 --> 00:10:59,241
I'm sorry!

245
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,619
I don't know what's wrong
with some people.

246
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:04,914
I wonder if anyone else thought
that this kid's name was Token?

247
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:06,624
Hmm? Anybody?

248
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:10,086
Anyone else just assume
his name was Token?

249
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:13,756
Because that's disgusting,
and you are the problem.

250
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:14,965
Doctor?

251
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,884
I thought I told you
to get out of my office

252
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:18,552
because you seriously
make me sick...

253
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:20,471
I'm gonna shit my fucking pants
right now.

254
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:22,431
Doctor, please,
I don't want to be like this!

255
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,392
I'll do anything,
just tell me what to do.

256
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:25,726
Oh, you wanna change?

257
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,771
Then I suggest you start
doing a lot of reading.

258
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:30,731
Okay.
What should I read?

259
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:33,275
And I suggest
that when you're reading...

260
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:36,695
You do it from the perspective
of a black person!

261
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:51,669
The knight Pigwiggen rides
on a frisky earwig,

262
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:55,589
and sends his love, Queen Mab,
a bracelet of emmets' eyes,

263
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:56,799
making an assignation...

264
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:59,844
Old Tom Bombadil
was a merry fellow.

265
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:03,889
Bright blue his jacket was,
and his boots was yellow...

266
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:06,183
It is told
that in their beginning,

267
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:09,186
the dwarves was made by Aule

268
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,355

As the owners of Tegridy farms,

281
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:00,529
you are accused of plagiarizing
a song

282
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,072
for your marijuana company.

283
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:02,907
How do you plead?

284
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,366
Not guilty, your honor.

285
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,452
The complaint says
that you asked for the rights

286
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:07,735
to the song "Ebony and Ivory,"

287
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:09,639
but when you were turned down
by Paul McCartney,

288
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:11,224
you copied the song
into something similar.

289
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:12,708
Not true, your honor.

290
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:15,461
I've never even heard
Paul McCartney's version.

291
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:18,547
"Black Puppy White Puppy"
is a song I wrote by myself

292
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,633
on my piano keyboard.

296
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,814
Guys... Lately I've been doing
a lot of soul searching.

297
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:38,234
I've had to ask myself
hard questions,

298
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:40,069
because for a long time now,

299
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:42,655
I've misinterpreted
some amazing writing.

300
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:45,407
I've done a lot of reading...

301
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:48,452
And I've learned why Sauron
built the black gate of Mordor

302
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:50,246
across the pass
of Cirith Gorgor,

303
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:52,456
which led into
the enclosed plain of Udun.

304
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,041
I've learned
that the Mouth of Sauron

305
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:55,417
was once a man,

306
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,253
who commanded the orc armies
of Gorgoroth

307
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:59,088
and dismissed Aragorn's claim
as King.

308
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,465
I think Stan's lost his marbles.

309
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:03,759
I firmly believe that everyone
would benefit

310
00:14:03,842 --> 00:14:06,804
from the school making required
reading of these books.

311
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:09,431
Because if we don't fully know
about Tolkien,

312
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:12,101
then we can make some terrible,
offensive mistakes.

313
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:14,895
In fact... did you guys know
that our friend Tolkien,

314
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:18,482
who goes to school here,
is named after J.R.R. Tolkien?

315
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:20,150
Yup!

316
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:21,485
Yeah, I knew that.

317
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:23,445
Why else would his name
be Tolkien

318
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,948
if it wasn't for the guy
that wrote the books?

319
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,493
My point is,
we need to petition the school

320
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:31,537
to make Tolkien
required reading.

321
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,455
To better understand
our classmate.

322
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,541
I think maybe
we all haven't done enough

323
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:36,750
to make sure that Tolkien

324
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:38,961
doesn't feel isolated
and left out.

325
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:41,714
Guys?
Can I come in now?

326
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:43,757
Not yet, Token.
Just another couple minutes.

327
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:46,719
W-What are you guys
talking about?

328
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:49,138
Just a couple minutes, bro.

329
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:00,774
♪ Black puppy bitch,
black, black puppy bitch ♪

330
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:03,277
♪ White puppy bitch,
black, white puppy bitch ♪

331
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,838
♪ Black puppy bitch,
white, black puppy bitch ♪

332
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:07,906
Hey, guys, I've got something
really exciting to show you!

333
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,326
Ohhhh buzzkill...

334
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,870
I had this awesome idea
last night...

335
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:15,414
and I couldn't even sleep
I thought it was so cool...

336
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:16,749
Oh, okay, what is it?

337
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:20,502
We do an entire line of cannabis

338
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:23,380
based on all the different races
of Middle Earth!

339
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:28,427
We do seven different strains in
all, representing the dwarves,

340
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,262
the elves, even the uruk hai!

341
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:33,599
Uh, yeah... no.

342
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:35,309
Everyone will think we're dorks!

343
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:43,359
Randy, you seem not to care very
much about any of my ideas.

344
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:46,737
Well, you're just... You know,
you're just not the idea guy.

345
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,281
I don't seem to be
the anything guy.

346
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:51,367
I thought we were Ben and Jerry.

347
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:55,704
Alright, look, I'm gonna tell
you the truth about ice cream...

348
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,873
Jerry actually doesn't do shit.

349
00:15:57,956 --> 00:16:00,542
Ben does it all,
everyone knows that.

350
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,586
Well, I don't want
to just be here

351
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:05,047
like some kind of token
black person.

352
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,383
Oh, come on, I'm sorry.

353
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:10,386
No, I totally get now
why you want me around,

354
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:12,012
and I'm not gonna do it.

355
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:18,560
He doesn't even really sound
like a black guy, you know that?

356
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:24,108
Alright, everyone, listen up!

357
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:25,859
We have a special announcement
today.

358
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:28,171
One of our fourth grade students
says he's done a lot of work

359
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:29,321
and has grown as a person.

360
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:30,965
And he'd like to share
his journey with you.

361
00:16:30,989 --> 00:16:32,029
Please welcome Stan Marsh.

362
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:36,370
Sup guys. You know, I've done
a lot of reading lately.

363
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:39,081
And I'd like to announce
that the school has allowed me

364
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:42,501
to declare today J.R.R. Tolkien
appreciation day.

365
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:46,130
These books go so much deeper
than the Hollywood movies.

366
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:48,006
And we see
its influences everywhere

367
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,633
in our modern culture.

368
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:52,052
In fact, how many of you knew
that our classmate Tolkien

369
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:54,096
was named after J.R.R. Tolkien?

370
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,519
But you don't know
that "Lord of the Rings"

371
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:02,438
was an analogy for World War II,
did you?!

372
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:03,731
And I'll bet you didn't know

373
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:05,858
that there was originally
19 Rings of Power

374
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:07,359
that were forged by Celebrimbor!

375
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:09,153
So there's much
we need to understand.

376
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:11,321
And so I would like to bring up
the man himself.

377
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:13,323
Come on up here. Tolkien!
Come on!

378
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:27,087
I actually don't like
"Lord of the Rings"

379
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:28,714
and I don't like "The Hobbit."

380
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:31,633
Just cause my dad's into that
stuff doesn't mean that I am.

381
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:34,803
I've always hated
that my name is Tolkien,

382
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:37,806
but I didn't really have
a choice, did I?

383
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,141
So please, whatever you do,

384
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:41,310
just don't draw
any more attention to my name.

385
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:42,519
I can't stand any of it.

386
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:46,482
It's a bunch of nerdy,
jive-ass dragon shit.

387
00:17:57,868 --> 00:18:00,871
Stanley,
are you feeling any better?

388
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:03,415
Nope.
Not any better, mom.

389
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,918
Well... Your friend Tolkien
came over to see you.

390
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:08,879
He's downstairs.

391
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:10,631
Tolkien is... here?

392
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:16,178
Hey, Tol-kien.

393
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:18,180
Oh, hey, Stan.

394
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:19,890
What are you doing here?

395
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:21,308
Stan... Are you ok?

396
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:23,936
You've just been acting
kind of strange

397
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:25,145
the last few days.

398
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:28,524
Yeah, I'm good. I'm...

399
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:30,317
No... I'm not...

400
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:35,781
Tolkien... I have something
I have to tell you.

401
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:37,574
Okay.

402
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:42,913
This whole time.
I thought your name was Token.

403
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:46,834
Like the token black person.

404
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:48,961
Wow...

405
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:51,380
Yeah.

406
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:55,217
Wow...

407
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,778
Why would my parents
name me something

408
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:59,388
that means
the only black person?

409
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:00,806
I don't know.

410
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:04,935
So I understand if you don't
wanna be around me anymore.

411
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:07,271
Well, it's not like
I really have a choice.

412
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:08,522
That's why I'm here.

413
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:10,291
My parents just bought the farm
across the street.

414
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:11,584
- What?!
- Yeah, out of the blue,

415
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:12,901
My dad was just like,

416
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,504
"We're going into
the farming business!"

417
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:16,113
And we all just picked up
and moved.

418
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:18,657
Oh, my God, this is great!

419
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,118
Mom! Dad!
Guess what?!

420
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:23,096
Tolkien's Family bought the farm
across the street!

421
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,163
We're neighbors!

422
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:26,123
Oh, that's great!

423
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:27,475
Yeah that's really cool, boys...

424
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:28,876
Wait, wha-a-a-a-t?!

425
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:40,345
What the hell's going on?

426
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:42,681
Oh, hey, Randy.
What'dya think of the new place?

427
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:45,976
Credigree Weed?!
How stupid is that?!

428
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:48,186
Credigree isn't even a word!

429
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:52,566
Oh, hello...
We'd like to buy a little weed.

430
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:54,693
It's our anniversary!

431
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:56,696
Well, there's really good weed
across the street!

432
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:58,280
Tegridy weed?

433
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:00,616
Yeah, we're just...
We're looking for something

434
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,451
with a little more...
street cred.

435
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:03,744
Yeah, a little more cred!

436
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:06,413
Well, ya'll came
to the right business,

437
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:07,748
cuz this shit is hard.

438
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:10,792
Oh, oh! He didn't even talk
like that before!

439
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,419
This guy is a total phony!

440
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:14,504
Now just come across the street,

441
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:17,966
and I'll show you some real nice
weed made with Tegridy.

442
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,510
These people
don't even belong here.

443
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:22,763
Wow, bro... you're a racist
piece of shit.

444
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:24,640
Can we see
what you've got, please?

445
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:27,768
Hell, yeah,
we got all kinds a shit...

446
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:32,147
Lemme give you a sample
of my Rivendell Elvish Magic...

447
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:39,696
They stole it!
They stole my idea!

448
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,074
- Who did?
- Those dickheads across the street!

449
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:45,077
They took everything I learned
about using black culture

450
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,996
to make a bigger profit
and they're doing it themselves!

451
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,582
Get this little prick
outta my house!

452
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:53,043
- Dad!
- Get him outta here, he's a spy!

453
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:55,629
Hey fuck face!

454
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:58,423
I don't want your kid
over at my house, you got that?!

455
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,760
Hey, man, what's your problem?

456
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:05,055
You want a war?
Well, you got one!

457
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:06,765
Game on, asshole!

458
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:11,228
Game on, muthafucker.

459
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:14,439
Everyone back in the house.
Come on, let's go.

460
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:15,857
But dad... Shut up!

461
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:25,617
The story of young
Stan Marsh might seem incredible,

462
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:29,037
but the fact is many people
suffer from unconscious biases.

463
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,622
If you or someone you know

464
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:33,041
might have also thought
the name Tolkien

465
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,377
didn't come from J.R.R. Tolkien,

466
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,670
then please call...

467
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:43,343
Because you
are the fucking problem.
