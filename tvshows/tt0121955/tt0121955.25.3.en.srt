Yes, sir -- If you're looking
to move out of the city,

11
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:43,010
I think your family
would love South Park.

12
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:44,978
You can get four times
the house here

13
00:00:45,012 --> 00:00:46,947
that you can get in the city.

14
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,217
A cortado?
Is that like a coffee?

15
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,818
Yeah, we --
we have a coffee shop here. Yes.

16
00:00:51,852 --> 00:00:54,187
We're up in the mountains
about an hour from Denver...

17
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:56,657
Do you think you could drive out
from the city this weekend

18
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:58,458
and I could show you
some properties?

19
00:00:58,492 --> 00:01:01,895
Oh, you have a Tesla?
Oh, how nice.

20
00:01:01,929 --> 00:01:05,399
South Park -- yeah, it's
a charming country village.

21
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:06,700
If you're able
to work from home,

22
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:09,503
I think you'll really love it
out here...

23
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:12,339
LaCroix?
The sparkling Mineral Water?

24
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:15,242
Yes, I do believe we have that
in our stores here...

25
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:17,678
We're seeing a massive influx
of city people

26
00:01:17,711 --> 00:01:19,313
moving out here to the country.

27
00:01:19,346 --> 00:01:21,648
And the truth is we just don't
have enough real estate agents

28
00:01:21,682 --> 00:01:23,217
to keep up with all the demand.

29
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,052
Well, I don't have
much experience,

30
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,254
but I thought
I'd give real estate a try.

31
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:29,189
Mrs. Cartman,
being a real estate agent

32
00:01:29,223 --> 00:01:31,692
takes a lot of intellect
and a lot of raw talent.

33
00:01:31,725 --> 00:01:34,027
You have to get
your picture taken.

34
00:01:34,061 --> 00:01:35,562
Get people to like the picture
and go,

35
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:37,531
"Oh, I'd like to hang out
with that person."

36
00:01:37,564 --> 00:01:39,399
And then act like
you like those people

37
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:41,101
when you show them houses.

38
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:45,372
Well, I do believe I'm good with
people, and the truth is...

39
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:47,574
I need to do this for my son.

40
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:49,276
Our...rent is going up

41
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:51,378
because of all the new people
moving into town --

42
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:53,780
and I don't think
I can afford it anymore.

43
00:01:53,814 --> 00:01:56,383
Well, then, I'm going to give
you a shot, Mrs. Cartman.

44
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:58,285
For your little boy.

45
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:02,589
God dammit...

46
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:04,358
Oh, you piece of shit!

47
00:02:04,391 --> 00:02:05,592
Hello, sweetie!

48
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:07,127
Mom! Where the hell
have you been?!

49
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,263
I've been home from school
for like 45 minutes!

50
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:11,565
I'm sorry, honey,
mommy had some errands.

51
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:13,634
I didn't have anything to eat
except Nutella.

52
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:15,202
I was about to call
Child Services!

53
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:19,206
Honey...
Mommy has some big news.

54
00:02:21,575 --> 00:02:22,943
What.

55
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:26,313
I...got a job, Eric.

56
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:29,416
I'm your job.

57
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:31,818
Oh, honey --
It's going to be good.

58
00:02:31,852 --> 00:02:34,221
Mommy is just going
to be working a few days a week

59
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:36,623
and you can be a big boy
and take care of yourself.

60
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:40,561
No.
Eric, this has to happen.

61
00:02:40,594 --> 00:02:42,529
We can't afford
to live in this house

62
00:02:42,563 --> 00:02:45,332
unless I make more money,
and this job pays really well.

63
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:47,334
Wha-- What job
could you possibly have?

64
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:49,136
You don't know how
to do anything.

65
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,438
I'm a real estate agent.

66
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:53,507
A what?

67
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,074
-== [ www.OpenSubtitles.org ] ==-

68
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:03,951
Hey, Butters,
I need your help.

69
00:03:03,984 --> 00:03:06,186
Well -- Well, sure, Eric!
What's goin' on?!

70
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:08,655
Butters,
I have some shocking news...

71
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:11,124
My mom got a job.

72
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:13,927
Oh...Oh, and you're worried
that maybe now

73
00:03:13,961 --> 00:03:16,129
your mom won't always be there
to take care of you?

74
00:03:16,163 --> 00:03:18,131
What? No.
My mom got a job.

75
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:19,533
My mom is dumb as shit

76
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:21,935
and somebody is paying her
to do something.

77
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:24,171
Have you ever heard of
a real estate agent, Butters?

78
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:26,139
Well, not really.
Yeah, well, neither had I.

79
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:28,375
So I looked it up on a bunch
of those shows and stuff.

80
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:30,644
You don't do anything.

81
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:32,212
You just look nice
and hug people

82
00:03:32,246 --> 00:03:34,548
and then when someone buys
or sells a house, you make
money.

83
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:36,216
Wow! Well, that sounds like
a good deal!

84
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,751
It's more than a good deal,
Butters,

85
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:38,752
it's *bleep* legal theft.

86
00:03:38,785 --> 00:03:40,320
If my mom can be
a real estate agent,

87
00:03:40,354 --> 00:03:43,390
then literally
anyone in the world can.

88
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:44,791
We've got
all these people moving

89
00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:46,126
from the cities into our town,

90
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,128
I can probably be a millionaire
in just a few days time.

91
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:49,563
Wow wee!

92
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:51,365
Now, whatever you do,
don't tell anybody.

93
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:53,000
If anyone else finds out
about this,

94
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,102
they'll all want to be
real estate agents, too.

95
00:03:55,102 --> 00:03:57,738
You've always been great
at taking pictures, Butters.

96
00:03:57,771 --> 00:03:59,907
I won't forget this
when I'm rich.

97
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,575
Gosh, thanks, Eric!

98
00:04:14,121 --> 00:04:16,823
Okay, Liane...
You've got this.

99
00:04:16,857 --> 00:04:20,827
You can do this.

100
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:25,499
Bottled water. Bottled water.
Bottled water.

101
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:28,435
Hello there! I believe I spoke
with you on the phone?

102
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:30,871
I'm Liane Cartman
with South Park Realtors!

103
00:04:30,904 --> 00:04:32,940
Uh-huh...Uh-huh...

104
00:04:32,973 --> 00:04:35,475
Well, this is the house
I was telling you about.

105
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:36,944
It just came on the market.

106
00:04:38,245 --> 00:04:41,415
It's a 2,300 square foot
mid colonial home.

107
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:44,551
Detached garage.
Pilates?

108
00:04:44,585 --> 00:04:46,119
Excuse me?
Pilates.

109
00:04:46,153 --> 00:04:48,722
Is there a gym
my wife can do Pilates?

110
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:51,925
Oh, you're about five minutes
from the local gym.

111
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,727
Pilates. Bottled Water?

112
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,496
Oh! Um, you have such
a lovely family!

113
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:59,600
It must have been a big drive
from the city?

114
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:01,435
Tesla. We have a Tesla.

115
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:03,136
Wi-Fi! Wi-Fi!

116
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:05,305
Is there Wi-Fi?
No Wi-Fi. Bottled water.

117
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:07,608
Well, come on in,
let me show you around!

118
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:11,345
Okay, this is a three bedroom
house with bathrooms.

119
00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:12,546
Front yard and back yard.

120
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:13,981
Eric...
what are you doing?

121
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:16,483
Oh, I just got some clients here
looking to relocate.

122
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:17,918
These people are from the city.

123
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,820
Uh, cortado.
Bottled water.

124
00:05:19,853 --> 00:05:21,121
Wi-Fi. Pilates.

125
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:23,557
Uh, excuse me one moment.

126
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:24,691
Eric!

127
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:26,793
What are you up to?

128
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:28,395
I got a job
as a real estate agent, mom.

129
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:29,963
You are not
a real estate agent --

130
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:30,964
Neither are you --

131
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:32,399
Now just march
right back home

132
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:34,334
and I will see you
when I am done with work!

133
00:05:34,368 --> 00:05:35,936
Mom,
real estate is an open market.

134
00:05:35,969 --> 00:05:38,105
You're not the only one
who gets to take advantage

135
00:05:38,138 --> 00:05:39,139
of all the city people.

136
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,241
Cortado?
Cortado!

137
00:05:41,275 --> 00:05:42,910
Oh, bottled water?
Wi-Fi!

138
00:05:42,943 --> 00:05:44,077
Metal bottled water!

139
00:05:44,111 --> 00:05:46,246
Eric,
this house is being represented

140
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,548
by South Park Realtors.

141
00:05:47,581 --> 00:05:49,950
You don't get to just walk in
and show it!

142
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:51,218
Oh! Ok! That's fine!

143
00:05:51,251 --> 00:05:53,587
I have tons of friends
in South Park!

144
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:56,256
I'll get my own listings!

145
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:59,293
Mayor: People...
this is the most exciting time

146
00:05:59,326 --> 00:06:01,228
in the history of South Park...

147
00:06:01,261 --> 00:06:04,698
As you know, there are people
from all over the country

148
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:08,869
leaving the cities and coming
to small, rural towns like ours.

149
00:06:08,902 --> 00:06:11,438
It's truly incredible
for all of us.

150
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:13,674
With this new surge of people
from urban areas,

151
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:15,876
we're seeing more town money
from sales taxes,

152
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:17,778
more profit
in our local businesses --

153
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:21,548
My bakery has seen
a 20% increase in sales.

154
00:06:21,582 --> 00:06:24,651
Oh, I just love
all these city people moving in!

155
00:06:24,685 --> 00:06:27,554
That's right. It's great to have
<i>chitty</i> people.

156
00:06:27,588 --> 00:06:30,724
These <i>chitty</i> people come
with their fancy <i>chitty</i> clothes

157
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:32,226
and their big <i>chitty</i> cars.

158
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:34,261
You know,
and these <i>chitty</i> people

159
00:06:34,294 --> 00:06:36,296
have a <i>chitty</i> way
of doing things

160
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:38,966
that will expose us all
to their <i>chitty</i> ideas.

161
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:42,636
Yeah, and they've got city money
and city lifestyles!

162
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:44,471
<i>Chitty</i> money,
<i>chitty</i> lifestyles.

163
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:47,140
And they'll move here
and bring their <i>chitty</i> families.

164
00:06:47,174 --> 00:06:50,077
And their cultured, <i>chitty</i> kids
will hang out with our kids

165
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:52,079
and expose them
to their <i>chitty</i> ways.

166
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:54,081
I've always dreamed
of South Park

167
00:06:54,114 --> 00:06:56,416
becoming more than a little
hick town.

168
00:06:56,450 --> 00:07:00,187
And these city people
bring with them...a new hope.

169
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,656
Here's to the future,
everyone!

170
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:04,892
All: The future!

171
00:07:07,127 --> 00:07:09,563
Okay, so this is a three bedroom
two and a half bath --

172
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:10,831
Come on in, everybody!

173
00:07:10,864 --> 00:07:11,865
Wi-Fi?

174
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:15,102
-Wha-- Wha-- Wha-- Wha?
-LaCroix.

175
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:16,603
You got about 2,300 square feet

176
00:07:16,637 --> 00:07:18,405
and there is
a finished basement.

177
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,907
Oat milk. Oat milk.
Detached garage --

178
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,108
stairs head up to the master,

179
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:22,743
which is an en suite,
if I remember correctly.

180
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,111
Let's get on back
to the kitchen...

181
00:07:24,144 --> 00:07:25,245
Cortado?

182
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:29,216
You've got a nice, big kitchen,
pretty, new appliances.

183
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:30,817
Door in the back
gets you out to the garage.

184
00:07:30,851 --> 00:07:32,019
Excuse me,
what are you doing?

185
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:33,153
Just showing them your house.

186
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:34,688
Come on, let's check out
the second floor --

187
00:07:34,721 --> 00:07:37,157
Our house isn't for sale!
Hey!

188
00:07:38,525 --> 00:07:40,360
Nice, big bathroom
for the two rooms up here.

189
00:07:40,394 --> 00:07:41,895
Tweek's grandma
is staying in one of the rooms,

190
00:07:41,929 --> 00:07:44,464
which serves as an office space
when she's not here.

191
00:07:44,498 --> 00:07:46,934
And then we are back down
to the spacious living room!

192
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:48,769
Will you please
get out of our house.

193
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:50,204
Yeah,
we're just about done.

194
00:07:50,237 --> 00:07:51,705
Well,
what do you guys think?

195
00:07:51,738 --> 00:07:53,106
MacBook, Tesla.

196
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,875
I'm sorry, I didn't get that...

197
00:07:54,908 --> 00:07:58,378
My son left his MacBook
in the Tesla.

198
00:07:58,412 --> 00:07:59,813
Oh, sure,
well, let's head on out now.

199
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:01,181
We can take a look
at Jimmy's house.

200
00:08:01,215 --> 00:08:02,349
It doesn't have
such sucky furniture.

201
00:08:02,382 --> 00:08:03,483
Let me talk to these guys

202
00:08:03,517 --> 00:08:05,152
and see if we can come up
with a number.

203
00:08:05,185 --> 00:08:07,087
I think I can get you
4 million for this place.

204
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:08,989
$4 million? Really?

205
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:10,390
I'll be in touch.

206
00:08:11,758 --> 00:08:13,961
Told you
our furniture sucked!

207
00:08:21,935 --> 00:08:23,971
Hey -- Hey, John,
I got some bad news --

208
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:26,707
We just lost another client
to South Park Realty Group.

209
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,709
What?!
We're losing people like crazy.

210
00:08:28,742 --> 00:08:29,943
These guys are ruthless.

211
00:08:29,977 --> 00:08:31,845
Who is this
South Park Realty Group?

212
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:33,180
Has anyone heard of them!?

213
00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:35,115
It appears to be
mostly one agent.

214
00:08:35,148 --> 00:08:37,818
A-A pretty young guy --

215
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:40,420
Can't have been in the business
that long --

216
00:08:40,454 --> 00:08:42,522
Oh, my God...

217
00:08:42,556 --> 00:08:45,158
That's a pretty
damn good picture.

218
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:47,227
How'd he get
that kind of depth of field?

219
00:08:47,261 --> 00:08:50,097
I don't know he's gotta be using
some kind of soft filter --

220
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,199
nothing I've ever seen.
Alright, everyone!

221
00:08:52,232 --> 00:08:53,901
Looks like we've got
some competition!

222
00:08:53,934 --> 00:08:55,802
If anyone thinks they can take
our clients,

223
00:08:55,836 --> 00:08:57,337
they've got another thing
coming.

224
00:08:57,371 --> 00:08:59,473
Everyone get up.
We're gonna retake our pictures!

225
00:08:59,506 --> 00:09:00,974
All: Awww!

226
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:02,776
No, no, no,
we're getting our butts kicked,

227
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:06,079
and we need to show this kid
what we can do!

228
00:09:07,981 --> 00:09:10,517
Come on, Chris!
You gotta look really welcoming!

229
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:12,953
Ugh. I'm trying--

230
00:09:12,986 --> 00:09:14,354
Come on,
arch your back more!

231
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:17,691
I'm, ugh,
arched as far as I can...

232
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,893
Come on, Chris,
you wanna lose another sale?!

233
00:09:19,927 --> 00:09:20,961
Arch your back more!!

234
00:09:20,994 --> 00:09:22,462
I-I got it --

235
00:09:24,998 --> 00:09:27,534
That's good, we got it --
Get in here, Carol!

236
00:09:32,172 --> 00:09:34,107
Got it! Ok, next!

237
00:09:41,713 --> 00:09:43,647
Hey, guys, it’s Eric
from South Park Realty Group.

238
00:09:43,647 --> 00:09:45,340
Are you dreaming of moving out
of the city

239
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,779
and into
the beautiful countryside?

240
00:09:46,779 --> 00:09:48,340
I want you to check out
Clyde’s house.

241
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:50,779
This is a 2,300 square foot
mid colonial home --

242
00:09:50,779 --> 00:09:53,439
detached garage -- now listing
for just $3.5 million.

243
00:09:53,439 --> 00:09:54,680
Let’s check it out.

244
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:59,977
♪

245
00:09:59,977 --> 00:10:01,241
This house is so spacious.

246
00:10:01,241 --> 00:10:02,713
I think my cameraman Butters
can attest to this.

247
00:10:02,713 --> 00:10:03,713
Isn’t this nice, Butters?

248
00:10:03,713 --> 00:10:04,977
Butters:
Yeah, it’s real roomy!

249
00:10:04,977 --> 00:10:06,043
Just look at these amenities.

250
00:10:06,043 --> 00:10:12,713
♪

251
00:10:12,713 --> 00:10:15,274
These giant, glass double doors
lead to the unfinished backyard.

252
00:10:15,274 --> 00:10:17,340
Plenty of room here for a pool
or a horse stable.

253
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,845
This is just one of the amazing
properties we have

254
00:10:18,845 --> 00:10:20,274
at South Park Realty Group.

255
00:10:20,274 --> 00:10:21,911
We’ve got other great listings,
like --

256
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:26,538
And my personal favorite,
Kyle’s house.

257
00:10:26,538 --> 00:10:28,472
Get out of that sewage drain
you call a city

258
00:10:28,472 --> 00:10:30,812
and start living the country
life you’ve always wanted.

259
00:10:30,812 --> 00:10:32,439
South Park Realty Group.

260
00:10:32,439 --> 00:10:35,944
Get out of the city
and into beautiful South Park.

261
00:10:53,241 --> 00:10:55,274
Uh, Liane,
you got a call, line 2.

262
00:10:55,274 --> 00:10:57,911
Sounds like a broker
interested in 4600 Highgate.

263
00:10:57,911 --> 00:11:00,340
Ooh! Okay.

264
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:02,845
Hi! This is Liane
with South Park Realtors.

265
00:11:02,845 --> 00:11:04,109
How’s it going?
This is Eric Cartman

266
00:11:04,109 --> 00:11:06,043
with South Park Realty Group.

267
00:11:06,043 --> 00:11:07,439
Eric, stop it.

268
00:11:07,439 --> 00:11:08,911
Well, I’m standing here
with some clients

269
00:11:08,911 --> 00:11:10,571
who want to make a deal
on this Highgate place.

270
00:11:10,571 --> 00:11:12,109
They wanna offer $175,000.

271
00:11:12,109 --> 00:11:15,109
You are going to get me fired,
Eric.

272
00:11:15,109 --> 00:11:18,340
And then we are going to lose
our home.

273
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:20,274
$175,000 is a great number --
$25,000 below asking,

274
00:11:20,274 --> 00:11:22,043
but you know
you’re never gonna get $200,000.

275
00:11:22,043 --> 00:11:23,878
Don’t worry, these deals
are always like this.

276
00:11:23,878 --> 00:11:26,010
I am doing this job for us!

277
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:29,076
So we can have a roof
over our heads!

278
00:11:29,076 --> 00:11:31,109
The HVAC all needs to be redone
and you know it.

279
00:11:31,109 --> 00:11:33,406
I am not talking about this
anymore!

280
00:11:33,406 --> 00:11:36,647
Okay, that’s fine mom, why don’t
you go to *bleep* hell?!

281
00:11:36,647 --> 00:11:38,571
It always gets like this
with agents.

282
00:11:38,571 --> 00:11:40,812
Don’t worry,
she’ll call back, watch.

283
00:11:43,109 --> 00:11:44,779
South Park Realty Group,
this is Eric.

284
00:11:44,779 --> 00:11:47,439
You are in so much trouble,
young man.

285
00:11:47,439 --> 00:11:48,812
Okay, okay...

286
00:11:48,812 --> 00:11:51,241
$180,000, but that’s as high
as I can do.

287
00:11:51,241 --> 00:11:53,109
We got it.

288
00:11:56,647 --> 00:11:58,779
It just isn’t fair...

289
00:11:58,779 --> 00:12:00,680
We retook all our pictures,

290
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:03,076
and what does
South Park Really Group do?

291
00:12:03,076 --> 00:12:05,274
They go and make a video.

292
00:12:05,274 --> 00:12:08,505
And just like that,
they take all our customers.

293
00:12:08,505 --> 00:12:11,812
I think maybe real estate
just isn’t the same anymore.

294
00:12:11,812 --> 00:12:15,241
Maybe we gotta start making
fancy videos to keep up.

295
00:12:16,538 --> 00:12:19,746
Excuse me, there’s all these
City People moving into town --

296
00:12:19,746 --> 00:12:22,505
and I think I’d like to sell
my property.

297
00:12:24,614 --> 00:12:26,142
-R-Really?
-That’s great!

298
00:12:26,142 --> 00:12:28,505
-Hey, hey, sir --
-We can sell your house!

299
00:12:28,505 --> 00:12:30,406
Move! Move! Get! Get!

300
00:12:30,406 --> 00:12:31,571
That’s a very smart idea!

301
00:12:31,571 --> 00:12:33,680
It’s definitely
a sellers’ market right now!

302
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,746
It’s good you came
to South Park Realtors.

303
00:12:35,746 --> 00:12:38,241
What kind of house is it?

304
00:12:38,241 --> 00:12:47,043
♪

305
00:12:47,043 --> 00:12:49,845
Once in a lifetime,
a property comes up for sale

306
00:12:49,845 --> 00:12:51,977
that is so unique,
it defies words.

307
00:12:51,977 --> 00:12:53,406
We know that good houses

308
00:12:53,406 --> 00:12:56,010
