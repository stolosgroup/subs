1
00:00:02,681 --> 00:00:04,081
Some asshat
pops out of my closet

2
00:00:04,083 --> 00:00:05,766
asking about my dad.

3
00:00:05,768 --> 00:00:06,834
Henry Winchester.

4
00:00:06,836 --> 00:00:08,803
That's
our grandfather.

5
00:00:08,805 --> 00:00:10,004
My father
and his father before him

6
00:00:10,006 --> 00:00:11,105
were both
Men of Letters,

7
00:00:11,107 --> 00:00:12,473
as John and you two
should have been.

8
00:00:12,475 --> 00:00:14,609
Our father
taught us how to be hunters.

9
00:00:15,645 --> 00:00:17,528
Okay, what's that?
I wish I knew.

10
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:18,946
I'm beginning to gather

11
00:00:18,948 --> 00:00:20,731
I don't make it back
from this time, do I?

12
00:00:20,733 --> 00:00:24,535
In the box is the key
to every object,

13
00:00:24,537 --> 00:00:27,688
scroll, spell ever collected
for thousands of years

14
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:28,823
under one roof.

15
00:00:28,825 --> 00:00:31,525
Take it
to these coordinates.

16
00:00:31,527 --> 00:00:33,160
What are the chances
that place is still standing?

17
00:00:33,162 --> 00:00:36,163
A chance we've got to take,
I guess.

18
00:00:54,566 --> 00:00:56,267
Heil Hitler.

When's the last time
somebody was in this place?

22
00:04:07,843 --> 00:04:10,094
65, 70 years ago.

00:04:43,945 --> 00:04:47,047
Son of a bitch.

24
00:04:47,049 --> 00:04:48,582
Look at this.

25
00:04:50,785 --> 00:04:54,955
Ham radio,
telegraph, switchboard.

26
00:04:54,957 --> 00:04:57,808
This was
their nerve center.

27
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:59,376
Henry did say
that they ran dispatch

28
00:04:59,378 --> 00:05:01,061
on their own team
of hunters.

29
00:05:09,654 --> 00:05:10,821
Wow.

30
00:05:10,823 --> 00:05:13,140
Halfway through their coffee
and a game of chess --

31
00:05:13,142 --> 00:05:15,993
looks like whoever
was manning the hub left quick.

32
00:05:17,579 --> 00:05:20,314
On the alarm call
that ended the Men of Letters.

33
00:05:46,007 --> 00:05:47,558
Son of a bitch.

34
00:06:07,913 --> 00:06:10,998
Sammy, I think
we found the Bat Cave.

Morning.

38
00:06:19,058 --> 00:06:22,893
The, uh, water pressure

39
00:06:22,895 --> 00:06:26,380
in the letters' shower room
is marvelous.

40
00:06:26,382 --> 00:06:29,650
Yeah. I still can't figure out
how we even have water...

41
00:06:29,652 --> 00:06:31,318
or electricity.

42
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:36,657
Yep, well, I am putting that
under the "ain't broke" column.

43
00:06:36,659 --> 00:06:37,942
Listen,
little brother,

44
00:06:37,944 --> 00:06:40,494
let's not go all geek
on this stuff, okay?

45
00:06:40,496 --> 00:06:41,745
"Geek"?

46
00:06:43,832 --> 00:06:44,949
Yeah.

47
00:06:44,951 --> 00:06:47,067
Yeah, I mean, don't --
don't get me wrong.

48
00:06:47,069 --> 00:06:50,170
This stuff is awesome,

49
00:06:50,172 --> 00:06:52,706
and it looks like they ran
a real tight outfit here,

50
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:55,759
but I'm just saying, you know,
don't, uh,

51
00:06:55,761 --> 00:06:59,213
don't think that they knew some
big secrets that we don't know.

52
00:07:00,098 --> 00:07:01,432
Dean...

53
00:07:01,434 --> 00:07:03,617
They were
a secret society.

54
00:07:03,619 --> 00:07:05,352
Which means
that they made crap up

55
00:07:05,354 --> 00:07:08,188
and wore fezzes and sashes
and swung around scimitars.

56
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:10,140
They probably
didn't even sharp--

57
00:07:12,811 --> 00:07:14,445
That's very sharp.

58
00:07:15,765 --> 00:07:19,483
Dean, look, I think
we might have something here --

59
00:07:19,485 --> 00:07:22,786
something that could help us,
help humanity.

60
00:07:22,788 --> 00:07:24,071
Henry
certainly thought so.

61
00:07:24,073 --> 00:07:27,291
I mean, you know damn well
we could use a break.

62
00:07:27,293 --> 00:07:29,326
What if
we finally got one?

63
00:07:33,915 --> 00:07:36,467
Are you gonna take off
the dead-guy robe?

65
00:07:49,931 --> 00:07:51,815
Well, well...

66
00:07:51,817 --> 00:07:53,317
It's so late.

67
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:54,801
I didn't expect you in

68
00:07:54,803 --> 00:07:58,022
Three times
I had to transfer the bus lines

69

You don't believe me
I'm being followed.

72
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:08,782
Nobody ever does.

73
00:08:08,784 --> 00:08:14,588

uh, manuscript FD113

the Holtzinger estate.

Oh, my.

that whole collection for us,

77

This book --
we need to protect it.

82
00:09:16,435 --> 00:09:18,685
This thing they put on me --
he's too close!

83
00:09:18,687 --> 00:09:20,404
I can't take this ledger
with me!

84
00:09:20,406 --> 00:09:21,488
Of course you can't.

85
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:24,024
It's part of
the special reference section,

86
00:09:24,026 --> 00:09:25,892
where it will be
perfectly safe.

87
00:09:25,894 --> 00:09:28,746
Oh. Oh. Oh.

88
00:09:28,748 --> 00:09:30,197
I still have
10 minutes, yes?

89
00:09:30,665 --> 00:09:32,616
Eight minutes...

90
00:09:32,618 --> 00:09:35,252

carefully.

93
00:10:22,384 --> 00:10:23,750
I got no time left.

94
00:10:23,752 --> 00:10:26,086
I found it!
I found it!

When you --
when you follow me here,

96
00:10:27,956 --> 00:10:30,557
you're gonna need
this number here --

97
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:31,842
Q...

98
00:11:01,673 --> 00:11:03,457
Why so shy?
Come in!

99
00:11:03,459 --> 00:11:05,592
Come in out of the cold!

100
00:11:05,594 --> 00:11:06,660
You'll have a cup
of coffee

101
00:11:06,662 --> 00:11:09,046
with -- with your old enemy.

102
00:11:11,015 --> 00:11:13,684
You Nazi
piece of rubbish!

103
00:11:16,105 --> 00:11:17,971
You Nazi pig!

104
00:11:36,574 --> 00:11:37,991
Hey!

105
00:11:37,993 --> 00:11:39,192
Hey!

106
00:11:39,194 --> 00:11:42,028
So...
How's Kevin doing?

107
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:43,463
You know.

108
00:11:43,465 --> 00:11:44,665
He's okay, I guess.

109
00:11:44,667 --> 00:11:47,918
In his corner,
hacking out his "Da Vinci code""

110
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,420
nothing actionable yet.

111
00:11:50,422 --> 00:11:52,923
Garth says hi,
by the way.

112
00:11:54,543 --> 00:11:56,310
Anything from Cass?

113
00:11:57,211 --> 00:11:59,879
No. Not -- not a peep.
Why? You?

114
00:11:59,881 --> 00:12:03,750
No, he's, uh --
he's not answering.

115
00:12:04,769 --> 00:12:05,886
Right.

116
00:12:05,888 --> 00:12:08,822
Well, uh, so I have been
trying to chart out

117
00:12:08,824 --> 00:12:10,991
the Letters' network
of hunters, their allies,

118
00:12:10,993 --> 00:12:13,327
uh, affiliated groups
they worked with, kept files on.

119
00:12:13,329 --> 00:12:14,611
Circa 1958?

120
00:12:14,613 --> 00:12:16,029
Yeah. True.

121
00:12:16,031 --> 00:12:19,616
Uh, most are dead or defunct,
but others -- I'm not so sure,

122
00:12:19,618 --> 00:12:20,567
and this one...

123
00:12:21,453 --> 00:12:23,337
...you should definitely
check out.

124
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,073
The Judah Initiative?

125
00:12:27,075 --> 00:12:28,241
European team --

126
00:12:28,243 --> 00:12:30,010
they were active
during World War II.

127
00:12:30,012 --> 00:12:31,712
Really? Hunters fighting
in a war -- that's cool.

128
00:12:31,714 --> 00:12:35,048
Not exactly hunters,
n-n-not exactly fighting,

129
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:36,950
but, uh...
Rabbis.

130
00:12:36,952 --> 00:12:37,985
Rabbis?

131
00:12:39,003 --> 00:12:40,437
Really?

132
00:12:40,439 --> 00:12:42,773
The Letters' file on them
is sketchy,

133
00:12:42,775 --> 00:12:44,775
but, apparently,
they were hard-core saboteurs.

134
00:12:44,777 --> 00:12:47,144
So, I ran a search

135
00:12:47,146 --> 00:12:49,696
on the initiative's
entire roster,

136
00:12:49,698 --> 00:12:53,500
and I got a hit --
one rabbi Isaac Bass.

137
00:12:53,502 --> 00:12:55,202
He was 17 years old
when he joined the Initiative

138
00:12:55,204 --> 00:12:58,472
and 85 years old
when he died...

139
00:12:58,474 --> 00:12:59,539
two weeks ago.

140
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:03,627
In a college town back east,
he was capped.

141
00:13:03,629 --> 00:13:04,611
"Capped"?

142
00:13:04,613 --> 00:13:05,879
Yeah.

143
00:13:05,881 --> 00:13:07,381
He was there
doing research,

144
00:13:07,383 --> 00:13:11,551
and according to eyewitnesses,
he spontaneously combusted.

145
00:13:11,553 --> 00:13:13,286
So...

146
00:13:13,288 --> 00:13:15,672
this is a case?

147
00:13:19,143 --> 00:13:21,261
I just got back.

148
00:13:31,856 --> 00:13:35,809
So you...worked
with the late Rabbi Bass?

149
00:13:35,811 --> 00:13:38,528
I was a research associate
of Rabbi Bass, yes.

150
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:41,665
I'm trying to complete
his last paper for publication.

151
00:13:41,667 --> 00:13:43,817
I'd just like to review
what he was after here.

152
00:13:43,819 --> 00:13:45,652
Well, that would be
quite a lot of material.

153
00:13:45,654 --> 00:13:47,654
He was here open to close
for almost a week.

154
00:13:47,656 --> 00:13:48,822
Wow.

155
00:13:48,824 --> 00:13:51,491
Um, how about just the stuff
he was looking at...

156
00:13:51,493 --> 00:13:54,678
you know,
the day he, uh...

157
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,396
caught fire?

158
00:13:57,548 --> 00:13:59,800
Does shorten the list
a bit.

159
00:13:59,802 --> 00:14:01,301
He was a really nice
old kook,

160
00:14:01,303 --> 00:14:02,335
really nice.

161
00:14:02,337 --> 00:14:03,937
Kook? How so?

162
00:14:03,939 --> 00:14:06,039
You know,
he'd talk a lot

163
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:08,525
to us, to himself,
to anyone who'd listen.

164
00:14:08,527 --> 00:14:11,061
He was always talking
about this secret war

165
00:14:11,063 --> 00:14:12,396
that nobody knew
was going on.

166
00:14:12,398 --> 00:14:14,815
Conspiracy stuff --
he was obsessed with Nazis.

167
00:14:14,817 --> 00:14:17,651
But he said they were
"Special Nazis," you know...

168
00:14:18,619 --> 00:14:19,703
Necromancers.

169
00:14:19,705 --> 00:14:21,822
Necromancers?

170
00:14:21,824 --> 00:14:24,024
Yeah, like from that
world of whatever-craft

171
00:14:24,026 --> 00:14:25,625
that my little brother
is always playing.

172
00:14:25,627 --> 00:14:27,527
Nazi...Necromancers.

173
00:14:27,529 --> 00:14:28,578
It's sad,
isn't it --

174
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,964
that old people
have to go so crazy?

175
00:14:30,966 --> 00:14:32,416
I know. It <i>is</i> sad.

176
00:14:32,418 --> 00:14:34,217
Hmm.

177
00:14:37,922 --> 00:14:39,389
You, um...

178
00:14:42,543 --> 00:14:43,643
I'm sorry.

179
00:14:43,645 --> 00:14:45,062
You, uh, you both
saw the accident?

180
00:14:45,064 --> 00:14:47,397
I can still
hear his screams.

181
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:49,232
It was like
the fire was alive,

182
00:14:49,234 --> 00:14:51,101
like -- like
it was attacking him.

183
00:14:51,103 --> 00:14:52,686
It was like watching
the most awful movie

184
00:14:52,688 --> 00:14:54,604
of the most terrible thing
you could possibly see.

185
00:14:54,606 --> 00:14:56,055
It was like that.

186
00:14:56,824 --> 00:14:59,276
Yeah.

187
00:15:17,211 --> 00:15:19,763
Special Agent Bolan.

188
00:15:21,081 --> 00:15:22,265
Oh, really?

189
00:15:22,267 --> 00:15:24,768
Wow.

190
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:26,970
I thought you were like
a headhunter or something.

191
00:15:27,939 --> 00:15:29,589
This is the second,
maybe third time

192
00:15:29,591 --> 00:15:31,591
I'm seeing you
today?

193
00:15:31,593 --> 00:15:33,643
Why you following me,
Gingerbread?

194
00:15:34,946 --> 00:15:37,314
Oh, so we
um...

195
00:15:38,599 --> 00:15:41,267
...we didn't have a thing
back there, huh?

196
00:15:43,371 --> 00:15:44,771
Back where?
W-what, now?

197
00:15:44,773 --> 00:15:46,940
I'm sorry, man.
I-I thought

198
00:15:46,942 --> 00:15:49,910
I thought we had a thing
back at the quad, you know --

199
00:15:49,912 --> 00:15:52,779
a little
"eye magic" moment,

200
00:15:52,781 --> 00:15:55,715
and I saw you here
and I figured I'd wait

201
00:15:55,717 --> 00:15:57,116
until you were done
with your meeting

202
00:15:57,118 --> 00:15:58,919
and then maybe
we might, uh...

203
00:15:58,921 --> 00:16:01,221
Yeah.
Uh, okay, but no --

204
00:16:01,223 --> 00:16:03,240
uh, no moment.

205
00:16:03,242 --> 00:16:06,576
This is a...
federal investigation.

206
00:16:07,628 --> 00:16:09,462
Is that supposed to make you
less interesting?

207
00:16:11,516 --> 00:16:12,816
No.
I-I'm sorry, man.

208
00:16:12,818 --> 00:16:15,318
I hope -- I hope I didn't
freak you out or anything.

209
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,155
No. No.
I-I'm n-not freaked out.

210
00:16:18,157 --> 00:16:21,975
It's just a, you know...
a federal thing.

211
00:16:21,977 --> 00:16:23,994
It's, uh...

212
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,980
Okay, citizen.

213
00:16:26,982 --> 00:16:28,498
As you were.

214
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,983
You have
a good night.

215
00:16:29,985 --> 00:16:31,618
You -- you...

216
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,537
...have a -- okay.

217
00:16:36,508 --> 00:16:37,657
- Yeah.
- Hey.

218
00:16:37,659 --> 00:16:40,961
So I, uh, looked into
the rabbi's research.

219
00:16:40,963 --> 00:16:42,379
It doesn't
make a lot of sense --

220
00:16:42,381 --> 00:16:44,214
um...

221
00:16:45,601 --> 00:16:47,717
...bird watching.

222
00:16:47,719 --> 00:16:48,835
Huh.

223
00:16:48,837 --> 00:16:52,055
Well, uh, the two
very hot co-captains

224
00:16:52,057 --> 00:16:53,607
of the women's
volleyball team

225
00:16:53,609 --> 00:16:56,560
agree that the rabbi's death
was very unnatural.

226
00:16:56,562 --> 00:16:58,011
I think
we still got a case.

227
00:16:58,013 --> 00:17:00,730
That would explain why I have
something stuck to my shoe.

228
00:17:01,949 --> 00:17:02,866
You being followed?

229
00:17:02,868 --> 00:17:04,201
Yeah, I think so.
That's weird.

230
00:17:04,203 --> 00:17:05,785
I thought
I was being followed earlier.

231
00:17:05,787 --> 00:17:07,153
Turned out to be
a gay thing.

232
00:17:07,155 --> 00:17:07,954
What?

233
00:17:07,956 --> 00:17:09,739
Nothing.
You need a hand?

234
00:17:09,741 --> 00:17:10,707
Yes, please.

235
00:17:10,709 --> 00:17:11,791
Got someplace
quiet?

236
00:17:11,793 --> 00:17:12,692
Visitors parking --

237
00:17:12,694 --> 00:17:13,910
the boonies.

238
00:17:13,912 --> 00:17:16,580
I'll park in the back.
30 minutes.

239
00:17:37,652 --> 00:17:38,935
Hey, pal.

240
00:17:54,536 --> 00:17:55,335
Dean?

241
00:18:13,854 --> 00:18:14,688
Stop.

242
00:18:17,092 --> 00:18:19,442
Oh, my spleen.

243
00:18:19,444 --> 00:18:22,779
What...the hell...is that?

244
00:18:22,781 --> 00:18:23,680
He's a Golem.

245
00:18:24,599 --> 00:18:25,982
Well, he's <i>my</i> Golem.

246
00:18:25,984 --> 00:18:27,817
Right.

247
00:18:40,594 --> 00:18:43,446
The rabbi who was murdered,
Isaac Bass,

248
00:18:43,448 --> 00:18:46,032
he was my grandfather.
That's why we're here.

249
00:18:46,034 --> 00:18:47,950
When you guys started
to follow up on his case,

250
00:18:47,952 --> 00:18:48,868
we started
following you.

251
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:49,952
So, wait.

252
00:18:49,954 --> 00:18:51,371
What you're saying
is that you and me --

253
00:18:51,373 --> 00:18:54,073
we, uh,
didn't have a moment?

254
00:18:54,808 --> 00:18:56,743
No, man.
I was tailing you.

255
00:18:56,745 --> 00:18:59,111
Told you
I was being followed.

256
00:18:59,113 --> 00:19:00,413
He was my gay thing.

257
00:19:01,415 --> 00:19:03,249
That was really good.
You really had me there.

258
00:19:03,251 --> 00:19:04,500
That's very smooth.

259
00:19:04,502 --> 00:19:06,586
Yeah, well,
smooth is just about all I got.

260
00:19:07,838 --> 00:19:08,971
What?

261
00:19:10,058 --> 00:19:11,858
Yeah, that's right.
Keep walking...

262
00:19:13,477 --> 00:19:15,378
...you chia pet.

263
00:19:16,981 --> 00:19:18,898
So,
that's a Golem?

264
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,016
Yes...

265
00:19:20,018 --> 00:19:22,318
Shaped from Clay
and brought to life by rabbis

266
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,437
to protect the Jewish people
in times of --

267
00:19:24,439 --> 00:19:27,023
I don't know --
general crappiness.

268
00:19:29,576 --> 00:19:31,044
And he's yours?

269
00:19:31,046 --> 00:19:31,978
Hardly.

270
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:34,080
My grandfather
left him to me.

271
00:19:34,082 --> 00:19:36,115
I'm the last
surviving descendant

272
00:19:36,117 --> 00:19:39,969
of the members of this...thing,
this...Initiative.

273
00:19:39,971 --> 00:19:41,788
The Judah Initiative?
Right, and he --

274
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:42,955
Who?!

275
00:19:42,957 --> 00:19:44,540
Whoa.

276
00:19:44,542 --> 00:19:47,009
Who are they
to know about the men of Judah?

277
00:19:47,011 --> 00:19:49,278
It's okay.

278
00:19:49,997 --> 00:19:52,665
It's all right.

279
00:19:52,667 --> 00:19:55,385
<i>We</i> are
the good guys.

280
00:19:55,387 --> 00:19:56,636
Yeah.

281
00:19:56,638 --> 00:19:59,272
W-we're hunters, uh --
Sam and Dean Winchester.

282
00:19:59,274 --> 00:20:01,040
We know about
The Judah Initiative

283
00:20:01,042 --> 00:20:03,643
because our grandfather
was a man of Letters.

284
00:20:04,978 --> 00:20:06,412
Yes.

285
00:20:07,347 --> 00:20:10,066
The rabbis
knew the Men of Letters.

286
00:20:20,961 --> 00:20:22,027
Thank you.
Thanks.

287
00:20:22,029 --> 00:20:23,379
Take a seat.

288
00:20:24,197 --> 00:20:27,083
So...
your grandfather

289
00:20:27,085 --> 00:20:29,869
was into all this
supernatural stuff, too?

290
00:20:29,871 --> 00:20:34,390
Yeah, grandparents, mom, dad,
truckload of cousins --

291
00:20:34,392 --> 00:20:35,925
the whole family
was lousy for it,

292
00:20:35,927 --> 00:20:38,294
but we...
never had a Golem.

293
00:20:38,296 --> 00:20:41,213
Right. Yeah.
We, um, we grew up in it,

294
00:20:41,215 --> 00:20:42,231
but you...didn't?

295
00:20:42,233 --> 00:20:44,167
My grandfather's adventures,

296
00:20:44,169 --> 00:20:46,552
the Initiative,
the Golem, the war --

297
00:20:46,554 --> 00:20:48,888
they were the stories that
he told me when I was a kid.

298
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:50,323
I thought
it was make-believe.

299
00:20:50,325 --> 00:20:51,441
So did my parents --

300
00:20:51,443 --> 00:20:53,109
you know, fantasies
to help him cope

301
00:20:53,111 --> 00:20:56,279
with all the horrible stuff
he'd seen,

302
00:20:56,281 --> 00:20:58,598
but every once in a while,
crazy old grandpa Bass

303
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,566
would come back by
on one of his trips,

304
00:21:00,568 --> 00:21:02,118
hand me a $20 savings bond,

305
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,353
and say, "one day,
you'll inherit the mantle."

306
00:21:04,355 --> 00:21:07,256
Sure enough,
a few days after he died,

307
00:21:07,258 --> 00:21:13,713
this big box
shows up at my apartment.

308
00:21:13,715 --> 00:21:15,414
Because when I opened
that box,

309
00:21:15,416 --> 00:21:19,235
this big, naked,
potato-faced lunatic

310
00:21:19,237 --> 00:21:21,003
wakes up
and goes crazy!

311
00:21:21,005 --> 00:21:22,905
I didn't...go crazy.

312
00:21:22,907 --> 00:21:24,941
You trashed
my entertainment center!

313
00:21:24,943 --> 00:21:26,309
And my water bed.

314
00:21:26,311 --> 00:21:31,096
This boy knows nothing,
observes none of the mitzvahs,

315
00:21:31,098 --> 00:21:33,816
labors on sabbath,
dines on swine.

316
00:21:33,818 --> 00:21:35,985
Everybody loves bacon!

317
00:21:37,955 --> 00:21:39,455
He's no rabbi.

318
00:21:39,457 --> 00:21:40,456
Yifalchunbee!

319
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:42,375
Don't start
with that stuff again.

320
00:21:42,377 --> 00:21:43,326
Yifalchunbee!

321
00:21:43,328 --> 00:21:45,277
Enough! Please!

322
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:46,629
Quiet time!

323
00:21:49,783 --> 00:21:51,450
All right. What was that?
What was he saying?

324
00:21:51,452 --> 00:21:54,637
It's Hebrew for something
like "take charge,"

325
00:21:54,639 --> 00:21:56,288
but I have no idea
what he means.

326
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:57,590
Look, I grew up
in Short Hills.

327
00:21:57,592 --> 00:21:59,124
I cheated my way
through Hebrew school.

328
00:21:59,126 --> 00:22:00,860
I never really listened
to my grandfather,

329
00:22:00,862 --> 00:22:02,011
what he was saying.

330
00:22:02,013 --> 00:22:03,930
So, wait -- he just
sends you this -- this Golem

331
00:22:03,932 --> 00:22:05,314
and expects you
to work it out?

332
00:22:05,316 --> 00:22:08,184
He didn't get much chance
to prepare me, I guess.

333
00:22:08,186 --> 00:22:10,486
My parents --

334
00:22:10,488 --> 00:22:12,438
they did everything they could
to prevent him

335
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,473
from screwing me up
with all his crazy talk.

336
00:22:14,475 --> 00:22:15,558
See, after the war,

337
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,777
my grandfather
spent the rest of his life

338
00:22:17,779 --> 00:22:20,379
trying to track down something
he called the Thule Society.

339
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:22,832
The Thule Society.
Right. They were Nazis.

340
00:22:22,834 --> 00:22:24,667
Nazi Necromancers.

341
00:22:24,669 --> 00:22:26,385
N-necro-who?

342
00:22:26,387 --> 00:22:28,337
Uh, Necromancer --
uh, witches, sorcerers,

343
00:22:28,339 --> 00:22:30,840
dark magic,
mostly with dead people.

344
00:22:31,825 --> 00:22:33,509
Okay.

345
00:22:34,494 --> 00:22:35,795
All I know
about the Thule

346
00:22:35,797 --> 00:22:38,631
is that they were this
twisted, secret fraternity,

347
00:22:38,633 --> 00:22:40,216
hell-bent
on world domination,

348
00:22:40,218 --> 00:22:42,718
that sponsored the early days
of the Nazi Party.

349
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,169
My grandfather said

350
00:22:44,171 --> 00:22:46,338
The Judah Initiative
was started to fight them.

351
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:48,558
And the Thule
murdered your grandfather, boy.

352
00:22:49,526 --> 00:22:51,510
Find them
so I can do my work!

353
00:22:52,362 --> 00:22:53,446
Hey! Hey!!

354
00:22:54,565 --> 00:22:55,898
We're renting here!

355
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,233
Renting.

356
00:23:00,588 --> 00:23:02,688
Look...

357
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:04,840
I think
my Golem's right.

358
00:23:06,076 --> 00:23:07,860
My grandfather --

359
00:23:07,862 --> 00:23:12,331
he left me this message
on my machine the day he died,

360
00:23:12,333 --> 00:23:14,867
and he said that
he had found something

361
00:23:14,869 --> 00:23:16,919
that the Thule
were willing to kill him for.

362
00:23:18,705 --> 00:23:21,390
He said he was hiding it here
in plain sight.

363
00:23:21,392 --> 00:23:26,596
He left me this weird --
I don't know -- equation.

364
00:23:26,598 --> 00:23:29,398
It's not a phone number
or an address or coordinates --

365
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:33,603
Q-L-6-7-3-W-3-8?

366
00:23:35,989 --> 00:23:37,556
Is it
a combination?

367
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:42,511
Oh,
it's a call number.

368
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:45,898
Library of Congress --
their filing system.

369
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,733
They use it
in college libraries.

370
00:23:47,735 --> 00:23:49,669
Uh, Q-L-6-7-3 -- that...

371
00:23:49,671 --> 00:23:51,737
That's sciences.

372
00:23:51,739 --> 00:23:53,539
Uh...

373
00:23:53,541 --> 00:23:55,625
Birds, I'm guessing.

374
00:23:55,627 --> 00:23:56,876
Let's go.

375
00:24:05,752 --> 00:24:08,387
What, do you two just break in
wherever you go?

376
00:24:08,389 --> 00:24:09,588
Yeah, well,
our dad wanted us

377
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:11,107
to have a solid career
to fall back on,

378
00:24:11,109 --> 00:24:13,926
just in case this hunter thing
didn't pan out.

379
00:24:13,928 --> 00:24:15,928
Okay, so if I'm right,
then I think your grandfather

380
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:17,763
switched manuscript FD113
out of the archives.

381
00:24:17,765 --> 00:24:19,098
I'll be right back.

382
00:24:53,568 --> 00:24:56,318
I owe you thanks.

383
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,739
The rabbi got me this far,

384
00:24:59,741 --> 00:25:03,192
but you...
took me all the way.

385
00:25:04,327 --> 00:25:05,811
Now,
give me the ledger.

386
00:25:10,868 --> 00:25:12,284
Help!

387
00:25:12,286 --> 00:25:14,003
N-necromancer!

388
00:25:14,005 --> 00:25:15,487
Stay here!

389
00:25:18,926 --> 00:25:20,426
Crap.

390
00:25:20,428 --> 00:25:21,460
Aah!

391
00:25:21,995 --> 00:25:23,379
Aah.

392
00:25:23,381 --> 00:25:24,964
Crap!

393
00:25:25,665 --> 00:25:27,600
Hey, big guy,

394
00:25:27,602 --> 00:25:30,853
they're both gonna die unless
we get whoever cast the spell.

395
00:25:32,857 --> 00:25:33,939
Come on.
Come on.

396
00:26:32,032 --> 00:26:34,066
Long live...

397
00:26:34,068 --> 00:26:35,785
the Thule.

398
00:26:44,761 --> 00:26:46,078
Or not.

399
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:03,017
Oh...man.

400
00:27:03,019 --> 00:27:05,419
The Men of Letters
healed you.

401
00:27:05,421 --> 00:27:06,737
They saved your life.

402
00:27:08,239 --> 00:27:10,457
What are they doing?

403
00:27:10,459 --> 00:27:12,710
Burying
the necromancer.

404
00:27:16,882 --> 00:27:18,782
That's like
a bag of Legos.

405
00:27:18,784 --> 00:27:20,267
The Golem
destroyed this guy.

406
00:27:20,269 --> 00:27:21,268
Yeah.

407
00:27:22,338 --> 00:27:27,941
So, uh...Thule Society
necromancers aside,

408
00:27:27,943 --> 00:27:30,277
what's our contingency plan
on that?

409
00:27:30,279 --> 00:27:32,863
You mean how do we
"oh, no!" Mr. Bill over there?

410
00:27:32,865 --> 00:27:36,033
I mean, I'd like to think
we could if we had to.

411
00:27:36,035 --> 00:27:38,769
Unless you think
Aaron can get a handle on him.

412
00:27:48,229 --> 00:27:52,383
Oh, my God.
These guys are psychopaths.

413
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:01,475
What'd you find out?

414
00:28:01,477 --> 00:28:04,061
I think it's a log-book
from a Nazi compound in Belarus.

415
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:07,648
It was run
by the Thule.

416
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:09,767
This is the red ledger.

417
00:28:09,769 --> 00:28:12,152
It was lost in the fire
that destroyed the compound,

418
00:28:12,154 --> 00:28:15,305
but my grandfather was convinced
it had been found after the war.

419
00:28:15,307 --> 00:28:17,191
Well, it describes
the horrible experiments

420
00:28:17,193 --> 00:28:20,194
performed
on the camp's population...

421
00:28:20,196 --> 00:28:22,145
magical experiments.

422
00:28:22,147 --> 00:28:24,731
More horrible
than words.

423
00:28:29,954 --> 00:28:32,256
You were there,
weren't you?

424
00:28:32,258 --> 00:28:34,775
At the camp?

425
00:28:34,777 --> 00:28:37,411
I was made
in the ghetto of Vitsyebsk

426
00:28:37,413 --> 00:28:39,780
to tear that hell down.

427
00:28:39,782 --> 00:28:44,000
I broke its walls, its men.

428
00:28:44,002 --> 00:28:47,838
The commandant burnt the place
to ash around me.

429
00:28:49,874 --> 00:28:52,509
Okay, um,
w-what does it mean

430
00:28:52,511 --> 00:28:55,779
when -- when you tell Aaron
to take charge?

431
00:28:55,781 --> 00:28:57,264
The boy would know...

432
00:28:57,266 --> 00:28:59,283
if he could
consult the pages.

433
00:28:59,285 --> 00:29:03,070
Pages?
W-what pages?

434
00:29:07,475 --> 00:29:11,245
When I was --
when I was bar mitzvahed,

435
00:29:11,247 --> 00:29:13,847
my -- my grandfather gave me
this little old book.

436
00:29:13,849 --> 00:29:16,767
It was in Hebrew.

437
00:29:16,769 --> 00:29:20,754
It was like an owner's manual
for a Golem.

438
00:29:21,756 --> 00:29:24,007
Okay. Great.
Get that, then.

439
00:29:24,009 --> 00:29:26,944
I
I can't...exactly.

440
00:29:26,946 --> 00:29:31,315
When I went to high school,
I sort of...drifted.

441
00:29:31,317 --> 00:29:34,718
I started getting
off the academic track,

442
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,321
and, uh, I kind of...

443
00:29:39,474 --> 00:29:41,341
...I kind of smoked it.

444
00:29:42,577 --> 00:29:46,396
The boy smoked the pages.

445
00:29:46,398 --> 00:29:48,949
They were
these thin, vellum-y pages.

446
00:29:49,751 --> 00:29:53,170
I mean, it was
perfect for rollling.

447
00:29:53,172 --> 00:29:54,872
Look,
they were driving instructions

448
00:29:54,874 --> 00:29:55,873
for a clay man.

449
00:29:55,875 --> 00:29:57,508
Okay?
It was nonsense.

450
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:59,760
Right? I mean...

451
00:29:59,762 --> 00:30:01,178
I...

452
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:04,247
Okay. All right.
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

453
00:30:04,249 --> 00:30:06,633
Why can't you just tell me
what I don't know?!

454
00:30:06,635 --> 00:30:09,102
It's not my place
to guide the rabbi,

455
00:30:09,104 --> 00:30:10,854
to teach the teacher!

456
00:30:10,856 --> 00:30:12,356
It's not my place!

457
00:30:12,358 --> 00:30:14,558
Yifalchunbee!

458
00:30:24,536 --> 00:30:27,371
That's not super-comforting,
got to say.

459
00:30:32,377 --> 00:30:36,463
So as far as I can tell,
these experiments --

460
00:30:36,465 --> 00:30:38,882
the Thule
were murdering Jews, gypsies --

461
00:30:38,884 --> 00:30:40,667
just about anybody
and everybody --

462
00:30:40,669 --> 00:30:43,303
then trying to
magically reanimate them.

463
00:30:43,305 --> 00:30:44,504
They were trying
to figure out a way

464
00:30:44,506 --> 00:30:45,706
to bring their own dead
back to life...

465
00:30:45,708 --> 00:30:48,458
Which I'm guessing
they figured out

466
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:49,927
because -- this.

467
00:30:51,896 --> 00:30:54,014
This last page...

468
00:30:54,016 --> 00:30:57,267
is a roster
of every dead Thule member

469
00:30:57,269 --> 00:30:58,569
who was reanimated.

470
00:31:00,188 --> 00:31:02,356
This is why
they killed my grandfather?

471
00:31:03,858 --> 00:31:05,108
Anything in there
on how to kill it?

472
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:07,611
Apparently, they experimented
with that, too.

473
00:31:07,613 --> 00:31:09,012
Um --

474
00:31:09,014 --> 00:31:10,447
headshot...

475
00:31:10,449 --> 00:31:13,717
But if you don't burn the body
within 12 hours,

476
00:31:13,719 --> 00:31:16,203
it reanimates again.

477
00:31:17,171 --> 00:31:18,822
Nazi bastards.

478
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,217
The security camera's

479
00:32:04,219 --> 00:32:06,386
hard drives
have all been wiped.

480
00:32:06,388 --> 00:32:08,305
Are you sure
he's been murdered?

481
00:32:08,307 --> 00:32:10,974
Torvald was killed here,

482
00:32:10,976 --> 00:32:12,192
but not by a man.

483
00:32:13,846 --> 00:32:16,947
I'd know more, but his ghost
was forced to depart

484
00:32:16,949 --> 00:32:18,882
before
it could tell me.

485
00:32:18,884 --> 00:32:22,352
They knew enough
to burn his remains.

486
00:32:50,965 --> 00:32:53,116
Blood?

487
00:32:54,185 --> 00:32:55,352
Clay.

488
00:32:58,022 --> 00:33:01,358
Torvald kills
the Initiative's last rabbi,

489
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:06,196
and now the Golem of Vitsyebsk
kills him.

490
00:33:06,198 --> 00:33:08,865
No, no, Garth,
not a tool society --

491
00:33:08,867 --> 00:33:10,717
"Thule" -- T-H-U-L-E.

492
00:33:10,719 --> 00:33:12,386
Yeah.

493
00:33:12,388 --> 00:33:14,538
All right.
Call me if you find anything.

494
00:33:16,208 --> 00:33:18,158
All of Garth's contacts
are stumped.

495
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,243
Nobody on the circuit's
ever even heard

496
00:33:20,245 --> 00:33:21,294
of "the Thule Society""

497
00:33:21,296 --> 00:33:23,046
whoever
these people are,

498
00:33:23,048 --> 00:33:25,799
they've been flying
beneath the hunter radar.

499
00:33:25,801 --> 00:33:27,167
Anything?

500
00:33:27,169 --> 00:33:28,635
Nothing solid.

501
00:33:28,637 --> 00:33:30,754
I mean, the lore
is all over the place.

502
00:33:30,756 --> 00:33:34,191
Uh, according to one legend,
um, it can be shut down

503
00:33:34,193 --> 00:33:36,810
if you erase one of the letters
off its forehead.

504
00:33:36,812 --> 00:33:38,795
I didn't see any letters on clayface.
Exactly.

505
00:33:38,797 --> 00:33:40,514
So, side-burner that.
Another one --

506
00:33:40,516 --> 00:33:43,100
"some have a scroll in their
mouth you're supposed to rip out."

507
00:33:43,102 --> 00:33:45,402
Wouldn't that give him some sort
of a lisp or something?

508
00:33:45,404 --> 00:33:47,237
Well, classically, they're not
even supposed to speak.

509
00:33:47,239 --> 00:33:50,373
We do know
that he took on an entire camp

510
00:33:50,375 --> 00:33:52,242
full of heavily armed
German soldiers

511
00:33:52,244 --> 00:33:54,845
and Thule necromancers
and won.

512
00:33:54,847 --> 00:33:56,863
One badass
hummel figurine.

513
00:33:56,865 --> 00:33:58,598
That we have no idea
how to put back in the box.

514
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,499
Great.

515
00:33:59,501 --> 00:34:02,119
So,
that's your plan --

516
00:34:02,121 --> 00:34:04,087
taking out my Golem?

517
00:34:04,956 --> 00:34:07,124
It's not a plan.

518
00:34:07,126 --> 00:34:09,776
We would just feel a lot better
if we knew how. That's all.

519
00:34:09,778 --> 00:34:12,596
What makes you think you have
any right to make that decision?

520
00:34:14,015 --> 00:34:16,099
Believe me,

521
00:34:16,101 --> 00:34:18,351
if we need the right,
we will take it.

522
00:34:18,353 --> 00:34:19,853
Look, he may be
a pain in the ass,

523
00:34:19,855 --> 00:34:21,655
but he's
my responsibility.

524
00:34:21,657 --> 00:34:25,358
Look, the Golem was built
to go to war.

525
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,827
You're not trained
for that.

526
00:34:26,829 --> 00:34:29,613
Now, how are you gonna
take that on?

527
00:34:29,615 --> 00:34:30,947
I don't know.

528
00:34:53,704 --> 00:34:54,838
Enough!

529
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:59,593
There you are,
you grim piece of work,

530
00:34:59,595 --> 00:35:01,377
after all these years.

531
00:35:01,379 --> 00:35:02,545
Eckhart.

532
00:35:41,248 --> 00:35:43,340
I command you by the covenant
of your makers --

533
00:35:43,342 --> 00:35:46,626
clay of Adam,
surrender your bond unto me.

534
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:56,497
So, you are
the Golem's rabbi?

535
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:00,868
You woke him...

536
00:36:01,787 --> 00:36:04,005
...but you didn't
take possession of him.

537
00:36:06,842 --> 00:36:10,678
You write your name
on the scroll, boy.

538
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:14,182
That's how you...
Yifalchunbee.

539
00:36:15,784 --> 00:36:17,384
I didn't know
what he meant.

540
00:36:18,987 --> 00:36:22,273
Knowledge is power,
isn't it?

541
00:36:30,165 --> 00:36:33,367
Now, which of you
is going to tell me

542
00:36:33,369 --> 00:36:38,339
where I can find
a certain red ledger?

543
00:36:38,341 --> 00:36:42,176
How about you screw yourself,
Nazi bastard?

544
00:36:43,912 --> 00:36:45,680
Can we...

545
00:36:45,682 --> 00:36:49,050
Could we put the Nazi thing
aside for the moment

546
00:36:49,052 --> 00:36:51,352
and just talk about this
like --

547
00:36:51,354 --> 00:36:54,222
Nazi necromancer dicks?
Pass.

548
00:36:54,224 --> 00:36:56,390
So I take it
you're the commandant?

549
00:36:56,392 --> 00:36:59,026
The one that authorized
all those experiments?

550
00:36:59,028 --> 00:37:01,862
Invented...

551
00:37:01,864 --> 00:37:04,431
Those experiments.
Thank you.

552
00:37:10,439 --> 00:37:11,672
So, what about you?

553
00:37:11,674 --> 00:37:14,041
I mean, you're not...

554
00:37:14,043 --> 00:37:16,210
undead.

555
00:37:16,212 --> 00:37:17,328
So what did you do?

556
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:19,880
You cast a "forever 21" spell
on yourself,

557
00:37:19,882 --> 00:37:22,616
like your little friend
at the library?

558
00:37:22,618 --> 00:37:23,951
His name was torvald.

559
00:37:23,953 --> 00:37:26,254
And you will suffer
for that.

560
00:37:31,626 --> 00:37:34,061
You know, I got to say,
spell or no spell,

561
00:37:34,063 --> 00:37:36,397
he broke easy,

562
00:37:36,399 --> 00:37:38,465
so...

563
00:37:46,908 --> 00:37:48,943
I'm sorry. "So..""

564
00:37:48,945 --> 00:37:51,862
Let me tell you
what I see.

565
00:37:51,864 --> 00:37:56,500
A magic Jew at my feet,
not a master in sight,

566
00:37:56,502 --> 00:38:01,222
and, finally, our secrets
secret once again.

567
00:38:03,825 --> 00:38:05,710
Which reminds me
of a story.

568
00:38:05,712 --> 00:38:10,831
"A Jew, two gentiles,
and a Golem walk into a bar""

569
00:38:10,833 --> 00:38:13,801
and it doesn't end
with them coming out.

570
00:38:28,984 --> 00:38:31,518
Fools!

571
00:38:32,871 --> 00:38:34,872
You can kill me.

572
00:38:34,874 --> 00:38:36,991
But you will never kill
all the thule.

573
00:38:40,879 --> 00:38:42,830
Well, that's a start.

574
00:38:45,334 --> 00:38:46,467
You okay?

575
00:38:46,469 --> 00:38:49,487
Yeah.

576
00:38:49,489 --> 00:38:51,222
Yeah.

577
00:39:16,763 --> 00:39:18,679
Well, now we know --

578
00:39:18,681 --> 00:39:20,097
paper beats Golem,

579
00:39:20,099 --> 00:39:23,017
fire beats
undead Nazi zombie freaks.

580
00:39:23,019 --> 00:39:26,103
So...

581
00:39:26,105 --> 00:39:27,772
What do you say,
Aaron?

582
00:39:27,774 --> 00:39:29,557
I mean, we got
a place we can keep him.

583
00:39:29,559 --> 00:39:31,609
No.

584
00:39:31,611 --> 00:39:33,927
I mean...

585
00:39:33,929 --> 00:39:36,564
Eckhart might be dead,
but you heard him.

586
00:39:36,566 --> 00:39:38,599
The thule are
still out there...

587
00:39:38,601 --> 00:39:42,386
hidden, active.

588
00:39:51,113 --> 00:39:53,681
That's my grandfather.

589
00:39:57,452 --> 00:40:00,471
He left me
something important.

590
00:40:00,473 --> 00:40:03,057
Something
only I can do.

591
00:40:30,585 --> 00:40:33,270
It looks like
I'm The Judah Initiative now.

592
00:40:33,272 --> 00:40:36,423
Yifalchunbee.

593
00:40:36,425 --> 00:40:39,310
B-but I thought I did.

594
00:40:39,312 --> 00:40:41,762
Yes.

595
00:40:53,892 --> 00:40:56,343
What're you doing?

596
00:40:56,345 --> 00:40:57,561
Ordering --

597
00:40:57,563 --> 00:41:00,197
I'm making a card entry
for our, uh, copies

598
00:41:00,199 --> 00:41:03,400
from the Thule's Red Ledger
for our collection.

599
00:41:09,191 --> 00:41:10,691
So, uh, what?

600
00:41:10,693 --> 00:41:13,210
Aaron's a J.I., and...

601
00:41:13,212 --> 00:41:15,746
you're a man of Letters now?
Is that it?
