1
00:00:01,084 --> 00:00:03,678
<i>One of the best things</i>
<i>about friendship with Turk</i>

2
00:00:03,878 --> 00:00:06,233
<i>is challenging each other</i>
<i>to try new things.</i>

3
00:00:06,423 --> 00:00:08,812
I can't believe we're
going to a strip club.

4
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:12,046
I don't think about it that way.
It's a place to buy a burger

5
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:15,379
that's a two-and-a-half mile
walk away from the hospital.

6
00:00:15,598 --> 00:00:17,828
No skin! We all win!

7
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:20,657
Let's get outta here
before we end up on the news.

8
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:22,924
Are you gentlemen
visiting the club?

9
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:25,574
No, we're protesting.

10
00:00:25,775 --> 00:00:27,606
I'm worried about the kids.

11
00:00:27,777 --> 00:00:29,847
So what's that in your pocket?

12
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,783
This is... It's $38 in singles.

13
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:36,142
I bought a newspaper
and this is the change from my 40.

14
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:39,384
Neil...

15
00:00:40,498 --> 00:00:41,931
Sir...

16
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:45,151
- No pulse.
- Starting CPR.

17
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:48,207
Call an ambulance!

18
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:53,732
Coming to you live as two young doctors
are trying to resuscitate my cameraman.

19
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:57,773
Well, maybe I'm biased, but to me,

20
00:00:57,974 --> 00:01:00,966
every doctor here at Sacred Heart
is a hero.

21
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:03,984
Does that mean I'm a hero? I don't know.

22
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:07,256
There's my dynamic duo!

23
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:09,717
Dr Dorian! Dr Turk!

24
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:11,973
Holy inferiority complex, Batman!

25
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:15,545
How low is my self-esteem that
I'm the sidekick in my own fantasy?

26
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:18,821
It could be worse, Robin.
You could be Alfred the butler.

27
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:21,028
Damn you, sir.

28
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:25,157
<i>Life in a hospital moves fast.</i>
<i>One second you're a hero,</i>

29
00:01:25,377 --> 00:01:28,050
<i>the next you're obsessing</i>
<i>about evaluations.</i>

30
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:31,371
- Who cares? It's only a grade.
- Really? What did you get?

31
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:35,743
A-plus. I turned on the waterworks and
the resident changed it to A-plus-plus.

32
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:39,368
- A proud day for women everywhere.
- Why are you worried?

33
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:43,228
With the hero thing, whoever
evaluates you will give you a gold star.

34
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:46,788
Listen, Supergirl. I'm gonna
break you into so many pieces

35
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:51,380
that my grandmother, who can do
a 1,000-piece puzzle in an hour,

36
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:54,008
will never be able
to put you back together,

37
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:57,428
even if she goes go back in time
to when her vision was perfect.

38
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:00,101
Somehow I doubt it.

Before you deny you like looking
at strange naked women again,

41
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:24,102
I should remind you that when you stay
at my place, it's not a hotel.

42
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:27,708
The movie titles do come up on the bill.

43
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:30,373
I'm sticking with ''we were protesting.''
JD?

44
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:33,286
Outraged and disgusted.

45
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:37,718
Take Bambi out tonight. Maybe
with the hype you can get him a girl.

46
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:43,936
Who hasn't bought us drinks yet?

47
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:48,634
It could happen.

48
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:52,931
- Don't wait up for me tonight.
- OK.

49
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:55,406
Do you wanna get drunk
and beg me for sex now

50
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:57,947
or wait till two o'clock tonight?

51
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:00,445
- Let's wait.
- Cool.

52
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:04,551
You know, I'm off tonight.
What are you doing, Carla?

53
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:07,687
Just having dinner
with a friend.

54
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:10,888
<i>Man, this is so uncomfortable.</i>

55
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:13,496
<i>She's not gonna get the invite.</i>

56
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,888
<i>Just hold your breath until it's over.</i>

57
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:18,426
You could take Elliot with you.

58
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:27,419
Great. I can't wait.

59
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,630
Have a good time tonight.

60
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,407
Lose something?

61
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,856
No, why? Did you take something?

62
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:40,299
- No.
- What'd you take?

63
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,108
Nothing.

64
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:44,015
What'd you take?

65
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:46,298
Newbie. Come.

66
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:49,912
<i>Now I think about it, I'm psyched</i>
<i>to have Dr Cox do my evaluation.</i>

67
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:52,706
<i>It'll be a chance to see</i>
<i>what he thinks of me.</i>

68
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:56,289
Look, Doogie,
I'm up to my cha-chas in busywork,

69
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:59,679
so I'm gonna take a rain check
on your report card

70
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:01,897
and have you do it yourself.

71
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:06,155
You didn't even fill out my name.

72
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:10,322
Well, now, I think it's John,
or Jimmy or Ji or hmm.

73
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,858
It's in the J family.

74
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:16,195
But if you get in trouble,
just ask the nurses for help.

75
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:21,914
Sir, I've been the hospital's
legal counsel for,

76
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:26,369
well, let's just say,
when I started, I had hair.

77
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:29,997
And a wife and family.

78
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:32,662
The point is, I'll never get a raise

79
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:35,575
without support
of senior staff like yourself.

80
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:40,246
- Can't do it.
- Well, you did what you could.

81
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,327
Dr Dorian, how are you?

82
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:45,641
- These evaluations...
- Just a pleasantry, keep it moving.

83
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:50,420
Listen, all the publicity you
and your friend have been getting,

84
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:53,175
it would be silly
not to milk it a little bit.

85
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:56,846
See if we can't promote the hospital,
what do you say?

86
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:02,936
OK, whose breasts
haven't I signed yet?

87
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:06,098
- It could happen.
- Excuse me?

88
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:07,902
Anything for the hospital.

89
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:12,365
- So what are we doing tonight?
- Go out to dinner, I guess.

90
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:14,322
Dinner! Where are we gonna eat?

91
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:18,554
- Don't know, some restaurant.
- Some restaurant!

92
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:22,970
Be honest...
Does this look hip enough?

93
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:26,595
Since when are khakis, a pink shirt
and a neckerchief not hip?

94
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:27,861
True.

95
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:32,522
- Hi.
- Hey, Darryl.

96
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:38,225
I have to make a quick call.
So, Patricia, Darryl, this is Elliot.

97
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:40,616
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

98
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:42,835
- I'm gonna get out of here.
- OK.

99
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,000
Thanks for the ride.

100
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:48,568
- Someone's a cradle-robber.
- Darryl's my son.

101
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:52,561
The only way he could be your son
was if you had him when you were 15.

102
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:54,403
14.

103
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,072
I was close.

104
00:05:57,232 --> 00:06:01,430
I'm sorry, that was my mom.
I'm gonna have to cancel.

105
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,447
<i>I can't evaluate myself.</i>

106
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:07,128
Would you describe me
as warm, professional, or both?

107
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,835
I'd describe you as ''I'm on my lunch.''

108
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,948
I don't know whether to
be easy or hard on myself...

109
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:16,440
Can't you see I'm watching my stories?

110
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:21,105
<i>I can't, honey,</i>
<i>Parker wants me to assist.</i>

111
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,975
Dr Cox. Have you been here
the whole time?

112
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:28,134
No, I just came in
through the couch door. Move.

113
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,777
You said you were too busy
to do my evaluation.

114
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:32,692
I am.

115
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:35,888
Didn't her daddy sell the coalmine?

116
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:40,017
- Contract didn't stick.
- That's interesting.

117
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:47,028
We're almost ready. Anything you
wanna say before we get started?

118
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:50,156
Yeah, I've got something to say
to Dr Cox.

119
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:55,044
I'm gonna give you the best damn
evaluation that you ever did see.

120
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:59,530
And this Friday,
at the Steel Cage Medi-Slam,

121
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:04,106
I'm gonna give you a physical
you ain't never gonna forget.

122
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:08,341
I'm gonna probe ya,
cos I'm The Intern.

123
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:12,819
Nothing. OK, I'll be right back.

124
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:18,010
She is tasty. Watch me work
a cat and mouse game with her.

125
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:19,985
She's married to the soundman.

126
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:24,141
That thing clipped to your collar,
that's a microphone.

127
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:28,361
I'm so sorry.
And I love ZZ Top.

128
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:32,327
I'm not looking forward to this.

129
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:35,691
OK, we're rolling.
So, how's my cameraman doing?

130
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:39,664
Good enough that he asked me
for mouth-to-mouth again.

131
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:43,308
Dr Turk, are there
any specific challenges

132
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:46,497
being a young black doctor
in an inner city hospital?

133
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:53,356
I wanna hear this.
Is it possible to turn up the volume?

134
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:56,158
That's as high as it goes.

135
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:10,415
Listen, let me tell you what happened.

136
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:18,516
Damn.

137
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:23,216
When I saw that it was missing,
did you not think I'd come to you?

138
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:26,381
I don't know what you're talking about.

139
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:29,820
So you're gonna play it that way, huh?

140
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:32,201
Touchי.

141
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:40,065
- I finished my evaluation.
- Great.

142
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:44,548
I thought it would take longer so the
marching band won't be here until later.

143
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:47,489
Enjoy. I think you'll find
it's a good read.

144
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:50,208
Hey, Newbie.
This thing actually does matter,

145
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:52,919
so were you completely honest
with yourself?

146
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:54,515
Yeah.

147
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:58,625
Say it right into the camera, hotshot.

148
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:03,763
Now you can have this thing back
any time you want.

149
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:06,880
You're gonna have to
bark like a dog, though.

150
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:10,645
I'm not gonna bark like...

151
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:12,992
It's your call.

152
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:14,705
Woof.

153
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:16,950
Good boy.

154
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:20,337
<i>At the very least, I'm gonna end today</i>
<i>on a good note.</i>

155
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,312
I got something to show you.

156
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:25,789
Is this an uncomfortable moment
that'll change our friendship?

157
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:27,980
No, no. You're going to like it.

158
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:30,949
Good, cos I need some good news,
man.

159
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:35,067
Can you believe that news lady?
''What's it like to be a black doctor?''

160
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:38,317
I just wish this was over.

161
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:42,939
Why have we stopped?

162
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:09,423
Roll 'em up

163
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:24,025
Why do you think
I wanna be a part of this?

164
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:27,643
Kelso said it would make us
role models. I just assumed...

165
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:30,345
Everybody assumes
that I'm a good athlete,

166
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:33,425
or that I grew up poor,
or that I love <i>Sanford and Son.</i>

167
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:36,147
But you do love <i>Sanford And Son.</i>

168
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:39,055
We both do.

169
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:52,163
That's what I'm talking about.

170
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:12,327
If Dr Kelso wants me to be
a role model for the community

171
00:11:12,547 --> 00:11:16,176
because I'm a great doctor, great.
I will sign on the dotted line.

172
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:18,656
But that's not what this is about.

173
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:22,042
All my life I've been
singled out because I'm black.

174
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:26,728
- I didn't enter the contest!
- Smile for the picture.

175
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:32,245
- Remember our college brochure?
- They put you on the cover.

176
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:33,758
Twice?

177
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:39,244
It's different this time,
now it's both of us.

178
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,103
You can still see
my hand on your shoulder.

179
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:01,373
<i>That's when I realised, I'm not gonna</i>
<i>let people take advantage of me.</i>

180
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:04,516
This is unfair.
You're supposed to do my evaluation.

181
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:08,114
And you know what?
You're gonna do it, buddy boy.

182
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:09,672
Buddy boy?

183
00:12:09,813 --> 00:12:12,452
Why, I oughta...

184
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:14,605
- I'm serious.
- Relax, Newbie.

185
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:17,449
It's just an evaluation,
it should be easy.

186
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:20,293
If it's that easy,
it won't take you long to do it.

187
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:24,768
All right, don't worry about it, Newbie.
I'll evaluate the hell right out of you.

188
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:28,824
- When?
- The second I get off work.

189
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:30,197
- Fine!
- Fine.

190
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,164
Great! Here it is.

191
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:37,052
- You get off, like, six-ish, or...?
- Danger.

192
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:48,037
You're gonna have to see her eventually.

193
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:53,459
No. I know the layout to the air-duct
system like the back of my hand.

194
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:56,890
Of course I'm gonna
have to see her again.

195
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,578
So this is the part where
it's my fault?

196
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:03,089
Turk, if you could have seen
the look on her face...

197
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:07,112
If I think about it again,
it's gonna make me cry.

198
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,088
What am I gonna do?

199
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:12,842
Keep doing what you're doing.
Eventually, she'll quit and move.

200
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:14,961
- Why am I talking to you?
- What?!

201
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:16,481
You're such a guy.

202
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:20,907
You can't understand something this deep
on any real emotional level.

203
00:13:21,176 --> 00:13:24,452
I'm sorry about the poster.
It was racially insensitive.

204
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:26,874
I should've been aware of your feelings.

205
00:13:27,057 --> 00:13:30,288
There's never been an issue of race
between us.

206
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:32,668
You've been nothing but a friend to me.

207
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:35,368
- I love you, man.
- Hit me one.

208
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:38,674
Keep it real.

209
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:44,097
We've got some things to work out
but we'll get there.

210
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:46,443
We'll get there.

211
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:52,090
Sure, it hurt. But you know what?
I'm not gonna wallow in self pity.

212
00:13:52,374 --> 00:13:56,890
Right after work, I'm gonna go downtown
and just tear it up.

213
00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:00,367
Maybe I'll have a cigarette,
just get a little crazy,

214
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:03,741
and head wherever the night takes me.

215
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:07,612
What's that, now?

216
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:17,429
Thanks so much!

217
00:14:31,663 --> 00:14:32,732
Taxi!

218
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,988
Hey, baby, how much?

219
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:37,441
Hey, don't go away, man!

220
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:40,346
Get me the hell outta here. Hurry!

221
00:14:45,135 --> 00:14:47,012
Here's what we're gonna do.

222
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:51,057
I'm gonna leave the cart in the closet
and leave the closet unlocked.

223
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:56,301
lf, by magic, it should happen to
reappear, I won't ask any questions.

224
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:58,993
I don't even know what ''it'' is.

225
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:01,829
Then why take it?

226
00:15:04,154 --> 00:15:09,069
Well, if it isn't Dr Turk,
the friendly face of Sacred Heart.

227
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:10,641
Yeah.

228
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:15,654
Dr Kelso, about these posters...
They're making me uncomfortable.

229
00:15:15,957 --> 00:15:20,508
I'm so sorry.
I didn't realise you felt that way.

230
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:24,629
Well, here's what I'm gonna do...
I'm gonna leave them up.

231
00:15:24,883 --> 00:15:27,272
I can live with that. Or I can sue you.

232
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:38,340
Dr Turk, you are an employee here.
I can advertise however I wish.

233
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:41,282
I can use your image, your name,

234
00:15:41,483 --> 00:15:44,839
I can manufacture
tiny little Dr Turk action figures.

235
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:47,948
It'll cost $12.95.
When you pull the string, it says:

236
00:15:48,156 --> 00:15:50,067
''I don't like these posters!''

237
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:52,630
- Isn't that right, Ted?
- Definitely, sir.

238
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:56,183
You'd certainly be vulnerable
from a legal standpoint.

239
00:15:56,414 --> 00:15:57,847
How vulnerable?

240
00:15:57,999 --> 00:16:02,436
That lawsuit would be over so quickly,
bring cab fare to the courthouse,

241
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:06,910
since Dr Turk will be driving
your Beamer home to his place.

242
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,398
Hippie.

243
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:14,163
God, that felt good.

244
00:16:14,349 --> 00:16:16,704
Who's the man?

245
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:18,884
- Is it me?
- Damn right it's you.

246
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:24,734
Right, man.

247
00:16:26,403 --> 00:16:28,200
It's me.

248
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:44,841
Elliot...
There's no excuse for what I did.

249
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:46,999
No, there's not.

250
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:52,497
- Are we done?
- I'm really sorry.

251
00:16:52,721 --> 00:16:58,591
Don't be. If I was going out
with my friend I wouldn't invite you.

252
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:03,929
Yes, I would. She'd like you better and
neither of you would talk to me again.

253
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:07,702
I only did it because I hadn't
seen Patricia in a long time.

254
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:10,742
You did it cos I don't fit in
with you and your friend.

255
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:15,384
It's no surprise. It's not like
I've ever fit in anywhere.

256
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:20,176
Carla, your friend Patricia's here.
There's a problem with her son.

257
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:26,137
Why so sad, Marshmallow?

258
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:31,684
<i>Stay calm,</i>
<i>stay calm, stay calm.</i>

259
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:33,996
<i>Oh, good. He's not here.</i>

260
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,999
Dr Cox?

261
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:42,463
It's time. Sit down.

262
00:17:45,148 --> 00:17:48,504
What do you want me to say?
That you're great?

263
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:51,727
That you're raising the bar
for interns everywhere?

264
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:54,255
I'm cool with that.

265
00:17:54,449 --> 00:17:57,247
I'm not gonna say that. You're OK.

266
00:17:57,452 --> 00:18:00,410
You might be better than that some day
but now all I see is

267
00:18:00,622 --> 00:18:03,295
a guy worried about
what everybody thinks of him

268
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,491
that he has no real belief in himself.

269
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:11,380
I mean, did you even wonder why
I told you to do your own evaluation?

270
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:15,284
I can't think of a safe answer,
I just...

271
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:16,823
Clam up!

272
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:19,565
I wanted you to think about yourself.

273
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:22,599
And I mean really think.

274
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:26,640
What are you good at? What do you
suck at? I wanted it down on paper,

275
00:18:26,898 --> 00:18:31,289
not so I could see it, or anybody else,
but so that you could see it.

276
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:34,606
Ultimately, you don't have
to answer to me, or to Kelso,

277
00:18:34,823 --> 00:18:38,133
you don't even have to answer
to your patients, for God's sake.

278
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:41,565
You only have to answer to
one guy, Newbie, and that's you!

279
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:48,256
There...

280
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:51,776
You are... evaluated.

281
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,716
Get the hell outta my sight.

282
00:18:57,887 --> 00:19:02,199
You, honest to God, get me so angry
I'm afraid I might hurt myself.

283
00:19:06,855 --> 00:19:09,085
So what are you?
One of the male nurses?

284
00:19:09,274 --> 00:19:12,949
Actually, I'm a surgeon.
I'm doing this as a favour for Carla.

285
00:19:13,194 --> 00:19:16,630
Carla is fine.
What's she doing with you?

286
00:19:16,865 --> 00:19:19,333
Slummin' a little, God bless her heart.

287
00:19:19,534 --> 00:19:21,729
This is a knife cut, huh?

288
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:23,788
Yeah, it's cool.

289
00:19:23,955 --> 00:19:28,585
See this right here?
Pinched it in a door. Two stitches.

290
00:19:28,877 --> 00:19:31,596
- Oh, man. You hardcore, man.
- Hell, yeah!

291
00:19:33,131 --> 00:19:35,804
Darryl's gonna be fine
but I'm worried about you.

292
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:39,718
You're upset. I'll set you up
in a room with some fluids and a Valium.

293
00:19:39,971 --> 00:19:42,121
- Elliot, thank you.
- There you are.

294
00:19:43,224 --> 00:19:45,294
Elliot, you're coming, right?

295
00:19:45,477 --> 00:19:48,549
- In a sec.
- Are you all right?

296
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:51,327
<i>It's funny how our perceptions</i>
<i>can be so off.</i>

297
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:53,276
Hot cocoa, sweetie?

298
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,702
Thanks.

299
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:57,928
Anytime.

300

00:20:20,011 --> 00:20:21,967
<i>And it didn't feel that good.</i>

305
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:25,972
I would like to make
special mention of one intern here,

306
00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:27,784
John Dorian.

307
00:20:27,936 --> 00:20:31,372
Smart kid, extremely competent,
and his enthusiasm

308
00:20:31,606 --> 00:20:33,881
and his determination
to always be better

309
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:37,264
is something I see in him
24 hours a day.

310
00:20:37,487 --> 00:20:40,206
He cares. Probably cares too much.

311
00:20:40,407 --> 00:20:43,717
But he's definitely somebody
you don't want to lose.

312
00:20:43,952 --> 00:20:47,388
If you have any questions...
I could give a crap, I'm goin' home.

313
00:20:47,622 --> 00:20:50,375
You all get paid too much
for doing nothing.

314
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:53,655
Oh, good, Newbie. You found a specialty.

315
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:56,233
No, I just dropped my pen.

316
00:20:56,423 --> 00:21:00,132
Well, look what magically
found its way back home.

317
00:21:00,385 --> 00:21:02,615
What? Your window cleaner?

318
00:21:02,804 --> 00:21:05,159
No. Ammonia.

319
00:21:05,348 --> 00:21:08,181
This is window cleaner, right...

320
00:21:14,024 --> 00:21:15,457
Why?

321
00:21:16,568 --> 00:21:18,160
<i>Now that's just bad luck.</i>

322
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:26,000
