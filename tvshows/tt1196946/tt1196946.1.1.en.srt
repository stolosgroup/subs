1
00:00:10,326 --> 00:00:12,794
Excuse me. Can I get a comment, please?

2
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:19,292
Yes, ma'am.

3
00:00:19,469 --> 00:00:21,300
We're just gonna keep you
right back here.

4
00:00:26,576 --> 00:00:28,908
- Captain.
- Agent Lisbon.

5
00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:30,842
Don't think we'll be needing you guys.

6
00:00:31,014 --> 00:00:33,005
We like the neighbor kid
who found the body.

7
00:00:33,183 --> 00:00:36,175
- Did he confess?
- Eh, he's a real squirrel. Hard to say...

8
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:38,650
- Did you kill her?
- Did you kill her?

9
00:00:44,828 --> 00:00:48,127
Mercy's father
would like to give a brief statement.

10
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:51,699
I just wanna take a moment
and thank everyone in law enforcement...

11
00:00:51,868 --> 00:00:56,237
...and all the volunteers who helped us
in the search for our beloved daughter.

12
00:00:59,042 --> 00:01:02,842
The way that this entire community
has come together to support me...

13
00:01:03,747 --> 00:01:08,013
...and Juniper in this terrible time
has been of great comfort to us.

14
00:01:11,855 --> 00:01:14,653
And now I would just like to ask that...

15
00:01:14,824 --> 00:01:21,525
...you give us some time, space and privacy
to grieve for our daughter. Thank you.

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,074

17
00:02:39,442 --> 00:02:40,466
Hello, Mrs. Tolliver.

18
00:02:42,011 --> 00:02:45,503
- Who are you?
- My name's Patrick Jane.

19
00:02:46,216 --> 00:02:47,683
I'm here to help you.

20
00:02:49,219 --> 00:02:50,618
Would you like a cup of tea?

21
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,581
Yes, I would. Thank you.

22
00:02:58,528 --> 00:02:59,825
You must be tired.

23
00:03:01,664 --> 00:03:03,461
Why don't you sit down?

24
00:03:05,335 --> 00:03:07,929
It's nice and quiet in here, isn't it?

25
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:10,504
Quiet, soothing, calm.

26
00:03:13,643 --> 00:03:15,372
Calm.

27
00:03:22,051 --> 00:03:23,951
I've been watching you
and your husband...

28
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,216
...and I want you to know that I understand
what you're feeling right now.

29
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,285
You have no idea.

30
00:03:34,697 --> 00:03:35,721
Believe me.

31
00:03:36,366 --> 00:03:39,665
I do. I know.

32
00:03:40,236 --> 00:03:43,865
- I know, and I wanna help you.
- You can't help me.

33
00:03:44,908 --> 00:03:48,844
- What do you know?
- All sorts of things.

34
00:03:49,946 --> 00:03:54,007
- You really only pretend to like skiing, right?
- Yes, but...

35
00:03:54,183 --> 00:03:56,913
You're pleased that your best friend
recently gained some weight.

36
00:03:57,086 --> 00:04:00,988
About 10 pounds. You wish you'd been
more adventurous when you were younger.

37
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:04,490
You love India, but you've never been there.
You have trouble sleeping.

38
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:06,993
Your favorite color...

39
00:04:08,197 --> 00:04:10,028
...is blue.

40
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:14,336
I don't understand. You're...?

41
00:04:14,704 --> 00:04:17,468
- You're psychic?
- Ha, no.

42
00:04:18,308 --> 00:04:19,400
Just paying attention.

43
00:04:20,777 --> 00:04:23,871
I used to make a good living
pretending to be a psychic.

44
00:04:25,214 --> 00:04:27,944
I tell you this
because I want you to understand...

45
00:04:28,117 --> 00:04:30,449
...there's no point hiding things from me.

46
00:04:33,323 --> 00:04:35,416
Hiding what?

47
00:04:35,591 --> 00:04:38,389
You know what I see
when I look at your husband?

48
00:04:39,395 --> 00:04:42,990
I see a warm, loving, generous man.

49
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:48,069
A little vain, maybe. Selfish. Controlling.
But a decent man.

50
00:04:48,237 --> 00:04:49,761
Yes.

51
00:04:52,775 --> 00:04:56,006
So why do you suspect him
of murdering your daughter?

52
00:04:59,816 --> 00:05:01,477
I don't.

53
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:06,985
- The McCluskey boy did it.
- Yes, that's what the police say.

54
00:05:07,991 --> 00:05:10,926
But you think they're wrong. Why?

55
00:05:11,694 --> 00:05:15,425
I don't know. I don't know. I...

56
00:05:15,865 --> 00:05:17,730
Tell me.

57
00:05:18,301 --> 00:05:22,897
The last year,
they have been so strange with each other.

58
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:27,202
And neither one would admit
that anything was wrong. And I think that...

59
00:05:29,112 --> 00:05:33,378
I think that she tried to tell me once,
and I didn't... I...

60
00:05:35,485 --> 00:05:38,818
God. Oh, God.

61
00:05:39,188 --> 00:05:40,849
Did you ask him if he killed her?

62
00:05:42,859 --> 00:05:44,190
What would he say?

63
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,386
Most wives can tell
when their husbands are lying.

64
00:05:49,198 --> 00:05:51,996
Yes. Yes.

65
00:05:52,702 --> 00:05:56,468
I... I don't want... Uh...
The McCluskey boy did it.

66
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:57,833
Maybe.

67
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:05,309
You think he did it too?

68
00:06:06,215 --> 00:06:07,944
I trust a mother's instinct.

69
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:12,186
June?

70
00:06:13,823 --> 00:06:15,313
There you are.

71
00:06:16,592 --> 00:06:18,321
Hi. Who are you?

72
00:06:19,362 --> 00:06:21,853
I'm the police.
Did you kill your daughter?

73
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:28,736
How dare you?

74
00:06:28,905 --> 00:06:31,897
I asked you a simple question, sir.
Did you kill your daughter?

75
00:06:33,609 --> 00:06:37,067
- No. I did not kill my daughter.
- Oh.

76
00:06:37,246 --> 00:06:40,704
Now, you get the hell out of my house.

77
00:06:41,684 --> 00:06:43,151
June?

78
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,084
June, what's the matter with you?

79
00:06:48,191 --> 00:06:49,556
I'm gonna have your badge.

80
00:06:49,725 --> 00:06:52,250
An innocent man
would've punched me by now.

81
00:06:52,428 --> 00:06:54,692
I am gonna make life miserable for you.

82
00:06:54,864 --> 00:06:58,322
You come in here, you accost my wife.
You cause trouble, uh...

83
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:01,826
June.

84
00:07:03,372 --> 00:07:05,067
June, honey, please...

85
00:07:05,241 --> 00:07:07,072
Shots fired. Inside.

86
00:07:07,243 --> 00:07:08,870
Move, move!

87
00:07:09,045 --> 00:07:10,603
Hey.

88
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:16,348
Honestly, it's not as bad as it looks.

89
00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:24,120
Mrs. Tolliver? Mrs. Tolliver? Please wait.

90
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:26,758
Front room's clear.

91
00:07:48,818 --> 00:07:50,945
Then the son of a bitch eagles 17.

92
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,680
Are you kidding me? On that course?

93
00:07:54,123 --> 00:07:55,886
A damn eagle?

94
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:59,653
That course never suited you, Price.
We'll do better in Orlando.

95
00:07:59,829 --> 00:08:02,821
- We have a nice spot on the draw.
- Well, I'll tell you what.

96
00:08:02,999 --> 00:08:06,162
Davis Love III can kiss my butt.

97
00:08:17,013 --> 00:08:20,414
Alison? Alison?

98
00:08:32,628 --> 00:08:34,687
<i>Flight 233 from Sacramento...</i>

99
00:08:34,864 --> 00:08:38,231
<i>...you may claim your baggage</i>
<i>from Carousel 2.</i>

100
00:08:38,401 --> 00:08:40,460
<i>Flight 233 from Sacramento...</i>

101
00:08:40,636 --> 00:08:42,763
Uh, sorry.

102
00:08:43,206 --> 00:08:45,538
You checked luggage?
What are you, on vacation?

103
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:48,108
- No, ma'am. Won't do it again.
- When your trousseau arrives...

104
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:51,178
...pick up the second rental
and go to the sheriff's department.

105
00:08:51,347 --> 00:08:54,009
Hustle us up a couple of rooms,
furniture and phone lines.

106
00:08:54,183 --> 00:08:55,707
Yes, ma'am.

107
00:08:55,885 --> 00:08:57,580
Come on, let's go.

108
00:09:06,696 --> 00:09:08,527
Morning, everybody.

109
00:09:08,698 --> 00:09:11,929
- How was your flight?
- Go away. You're on suspension.

110
00:09:12,835 --> 00:09:14,393
Thank you.

111
00:09:15,271 --> 00:09:19,173
- Mandated leave. Ends next week.
- So come back next week.

112
00:09:19,342 --> 00:09:22,539
- Hot enough for you?
- Which one of you jackasses told him?

113
00:09:22,712 --> 00:09:24,236
- It was you, wasn't it, Cho?
- Yes.

114
00:09:24,413 --> 00:09:27,780
Of course he called me. It's Red John.
Can't keep me out of this.

115
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:28,974
Why would you want to?

116
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:31,119
You got a man killed.
There's consequences.

117
00:09:31,287 --> 00:09:34,620
A man that murdered his daughter
because she wouldn't have sex with him?

118
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:37,418
You did not know that.
If she hadn't left the diary...

119
00:09:37,593 --> 00:09:40,756
But she did, though. Be reasonable.
This is my case.

120
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:43,194
- Your case?
- Red John's mine.

121
00:09:43,366 --> 00:09:45,266
Red John doesn't belong to anyone.

122
00:09:48,404 --> 00:09:49,428
He belongs to me.

123
00:09:50,973 --> 00:09:55,307
It's not my call. Rules are rules.
Come back next week.

124
00:09:56,445 --> 00:09:58,640
Don't let this man past.

125
00:10:05,321 --> 00:10:06,788
Boss.

126
00:10:06,956 --> 00:10:11,086
We have Gregory Tannen,
Caucasian, male, 43, single.

127
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,887
We haven't opened him up yet, but...

128
00:10:13,062 --> 00:10:17,158
Sorry I went over your head.
I'll redeem myself, I promise.

129
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:18,960
You want redemption, be silent.

130
00:10:19,135 --> 00:10:21,365
- Okay, I can learn to do that.
- Shh.

131
00:10:23,472 --> 00:10:24,496
Sorry.

132
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:31,076
Burn marks here indicate that
the victim was subdued with a stun gun...

133
00:10:31,247 --> 00:10:33,340
...standard civilian model,
by the look of it.

134
00:10:33,516 --> 00:10:36,781
Death appears to be caused
by several blows to the back of the skull...

135
00:10:36,952 --> 00:10:40,046
...consistent with the bloody golf club
found at the scene.

136
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:45,387
Female is Alison Randolph,
27, married, no children.

137
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:49,327
They were found at her listed residence.
TOD looks to be early Saturday evening.

138
00:10:49,498 --> 00:10:51,159
On Alison, we have stun-gun marks...

139
00:10:51,334 --> 00:10:54,428
...followed by binding
with tight, black, plastic ligatures...

140
00:10:54,603 --> 00:10:58,300
...frenzied cutting and stabbing assault
of the torso, and abuse of the viscera.

141
00:10:58,474 --> 00:11:00,408
- Textbook Red John.
- Who found the bodies?

142
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:03,670
This one's husband, coming home
from the airport with his brother.

143
00:11:03,846 --> 00:11:05,370
- He's a pro golfer.
- Oh, yeah?

144
00:11:05,548 --> 00:11:06,947
Price Randolph?

145
00:11:07,116 --> 00:11:10,711
- What's her deal with him? Do we know?
- He's on file as one of her physicians.

146
00:11:10,886 --> 00:11:12,547
- Making a house call?
- Lovers?

147
00:11:12,722 --> 00:11:14,656
No. This one's gay.

148
00:11:17,293 --> 00:11:19,887
Dr. Wagner might know
what their relationship was.

149
00:11:20,062 --> 00:11:21,552
He's here to make the formal ID.

150
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:25,191
Okay.

151
00:11:25,835 --> 00:11:29,236
Dr. Wagner. Hi.

152
00:11:29,405 --> 00:11:33,000
I'm Agent Teresa Lisbon,
California Bureau of Investigation.

153
00:11:33,175 --> 00:11:36,235
- What's your connection to the victims?
- Well, I work with Gregory.

154
00:11:36,412 --> 00:11:40,746
Dr. Tannen and the Randolph family
are long-time clients of our practice.

155
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:43,680
- Are house calls the norm at your practice?
- No.

156
00:11:43,853 --> 00:11:45,912
Gregory and Alison were close friends.

157
00:11:46,088 --> 00:11:48,488
- Lovers?
- No. He was gay.

158
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,059
No, they were just friends.

159
00:11:52,094 --> 00:11:55,063
- What in God's name happened to them?
- Looks like Red John.

160
00:11:57,066 --> 00:11:59,660
- Who's Red John?
- We don't know who did this.

161
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:03,864
We'll be in touch probably. Thank you.

162
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:11,076
Tracy wanna set up? Here?

163
00:12:11,247 --> 00:12:12,271
Yeah, that's good.

164
00:12:12,448 --> 00:12:14,712
Red John enters here.

165
00:12:14,884 --> 00:12:16,943
Excuse me. Sorry.

166
00:12:17,119 --> 00:12:18,882
He comes around here.

167
00:12:19,722 --> 00:12:23,886
He waits for her,
expecting her to come in alone.

168
00:12:24,059 --> 00:12:26,527
Only thing, her friend Tannen
chose the wrong night...

169
00:12:26,695 --> 00:12:29,425
...to come over for a Richard Gere
and ice-cream orgy.

170
00:12:30,733 --> 00:12:34,897
So Red John zaps them both
with his trusty stun gun...

171
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:37,265
...and... Excuse me.

172
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,340
- Grabs a five iron from the bag here...

173
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:42,272
...and... Ugh!

174
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:46,246
Crushes Tannen's skull.

175
00:12:47,149 --> 00:12:50,744
Then he takes his sweet time
dealing with Alison how he likes.

176
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,380
She's a nice big girl...

177
00:12:52,555 --> 00:12:56,252
...so unless he's pretty strong, I'm guessing
that he grabbed her by the arms...

178
00:12:56,425 --> 00:12:58,416
...and dragged her down the hall.

179
00:13:36,365 --> 00:13:40,768
He says he's sorry for all the pain
he's caused you and your mother.

180
00:13:42,171 --> 00:13:43,365
Deeply sorry.

181
00:13:44,807 --> 00:13:47,298
He asks you to forgive him.

182
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:49,635
Can you do that Jenny?

183
00:13:51,547 --> 00:13:53,777
- He needs to hear it.
- I forgive you, Daddy.

184
00:13:53,949 --> 00:13:56,315
- Oh, yes.
- I forgive you.

185
00:13:56,819 --> 00:13:58,047
He's smiling now.

186
00:13:59,488 --> 00:14:00,819
There are tears of joy.

187
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:05,286
He says, "God bless you and keep you."

188
00:14:11,367 --> 00:14:12,391
He's gone.

189
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:28,413
- Amazing, amazing. Amazing.
- She's amazed.

190
00:14:30,686 --> 00:14:32,313
- Patrick...
- One second.

191
00:14:32,488 --> 00:14:35,980
- Give him some time.
- Abso... Come on back to us.

192
00:14:36,158 --> 00:14:38,251
- I'm back. Thank you.
- He's back. Ha-ha-ha.

193
00:14:38,427 --> 00:14:44,161
So, Patrick, I understand that
you're also sort of a paranormal detective.

194
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:47,666
- Is that right?
- I try to help the police when I can.

195
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:52,335
And you're helping them hunt
this scary serial killer.

196
00:14:52,508 --> 00:14:54,476
- What's his name? Red John.
- Red John.

197
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:59,478
There she blows.
Classic Red John smiley face.

198
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:06,178
Drawn in the victims' blood, clockwise,
with three fingers of his right hand...

199
00:15:06,355 --> 00:15:08,380
...wearing a rubber kitchen glove.

200
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:12,282
- I'm stoked to finally see one in the flesh.
- This isn't Red John.

201
00:15:13,762 --> 00:15:14,786
Right.

202
00:15:15,864 --> 00:15:18,560
Red John thinks of himself
as a showman, an artist.

203
00:15:18,734 --> 00:15:21,532
He has a strong sense of theater.
In the previous killings...

204
00:15:21,704 --> 00:15:24,366
...he made sure that the first thing
that anyone sees...

205
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,599
...is the face on the wall.

206
00:15:26,775 --> 00:15:29,005
You see the face first, and you know.

207
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:31,738
You know what's happened,
and you feel dread.

208
00:15:31,914 --> 00:15:34,644
Then, and only then,
do you see the body of the victim.

209
00:15:34,817 --> 00:15:36,284
Always in that order.

210
00:15:36,452 --> 00:15:40,650
Here, it's the opposite.
The first thing you see is the body...

211
00:15:40,823 --> 00:15:44,122
...and you have to look around
to see the face on the wall.

212
00:15:44,793 --> 00:15:48,695
- Doesn't play nearly as well, does it?
- Depends on your taste, I suppose.

213
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:52,800
No. Come on. The killer could've painted
on the correct wall here, but he didn't...

214
00:15:52,968 --> 00:15:55,732
...because he didn't know better,
because he isn't Red John.

215
00:15:56,405 --> 00:16:00,171
Wow. That's interesting.

216
00:16:01,977 --> 00:16:04,411
You know what your problem is,
my friend?

217
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:07,276
You enjoy your work a little too much.
You're a ghoul.

218
00:16:08,851 --> 00:16:11,615
If you don't get horny reading <i>Fangoria,</i>
I'm Britney Spears.

219
00:16:11,787 --> 00:16:13,618
I... I resent that.

220
00:16:13,789 --> 00:16:17,418
- This is you trying to redeem yourself, is it?
- I'm sorry.

221
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,923
He irks me.

222
00:16:20,295 --> 00:16:21,421
He's irksome.

223
00:16:23,499 --> 00:16:24,591
You don't need me here.

224
00:16:39,848 --> 00:16:44,080
- So, yeah, this one doesn't fit the pattern.
- So Jane was right. We have a copycat.

225
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:47,950
Or we have Red John trying new things.
Or we have Red John making a mistake.

226
00:16:48,123 --> 00:16:50,921
We don't know.
We'll work the evidence until we do know.

227
00:16:52,061 --> 00:16:54,552
- Go talk to the husband.
- Will do, boss.

228
00:16:59,568 --> 00:17:01,593
What are you waiting for?

229
00:17:22,591 --> 00:17:26,220
Hey. So you might be right
about this case. Might be.

230
00:17:26,395 --> 00:17:28,329
Thanks for the insight.

231
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:30,989
No. Did I say that?

232
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:34,533
I'm acknowledging the fact
that you might be right, that's all.

233
00:17:34,703 --> 00:17:38,264
I mean, if you wanted to come back,
I couldn't stop you.

234
00:17:39,341 --> 00:17:42,777
Yeah, fine. I'm asking you to come back.

235
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,038
Because.

236
00:17:46,215 --> 00:17:49,184
Because you're useful to the team.

237
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:52,510
No. No, I won't say "please."
Go screw yourself.

238
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:55,517
Jackass.

239
00:18:04,867 --> 00:18:06,334
Good morning.

240
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,163
Can I help you?

241
00:18:09,538 --> 00:18:11,301
You must be Van Pelt.

242
00:18:11,473 --> 00:18:12,963
Pleasure. Patrick Jane.

243
00:18:13,142 --> 00:18:15,940
Oh, hi. Good to meet you.
Agent Cho said you'd left town.

244
00:18:16,378 --> 00:18:17,845
No. Nowhere to go.

245
00:18:19,414 --> 00:18:20,745
Okay. Um.

246
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:23,783
Do you want that desk over there,
or this one?

247
00:18:23,952 --> 00:18:27,945
- I mean, that one gets more light.
- That one. More light, by all means.

248
00:18:30,459 --> 00:18:33,019
Very pleasant addition
to the Serious Crimes family.

249
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:35,390
Oh. Hi. When did you get here?

250
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:37,889
<i>Stop. I give up.</i>

251
00:18:38,066 --> 00:18:40,227
<i>Aah! Stop. Stop. Turn off the camera.</i>

252
00:18:40,402 --> 00:18:42,165
<i>Tag. Come on, come on, come on.</i>

253
00:18:42,337 --> 00:18:44,737
- <i>Okay, we're done. We're done.</i>
- <i>Stop. Good, good.</i>

254
00:18:45,808 --> 00:18:47,571
<i>You are awful.</i>

255
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:50,537
- <i>Go, go, go.</i>
- <i>Stop, please.</i>

256
00:18:50,979 --> 00:18:52,844
<i>Stop.</i>

257
00:18:56,251 --> 00:18:59,743
I lost a beautiful, precious angel.

258
00:19:00,989 --> 00:19:02,547
Yes, sir.

259
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:03,748
Good-looking woman.

260
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:09,727
I'm jumping right in,
if you don't mind, Price.

261
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:11,923
You missed the tournament cut
on Friday, yes?

262
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:15,866
But you didn't come home until Sunday.
What'd you do with the rest of your time?

263
00:19:16,038 --> 00:19:18,370
I get this.
You guys can't catch the real killer...

264
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:20,633
- ...so you wanna lay this one on me?
- No, sir.

265
00:19:20,809 --> 00:19:25,269
If we have confirmation of where you were,
lets us exclude you from the investigation.

266
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:37,720
I was with a massage therapist.

267
00:19:37,893 --> 00:19:39,258
Name?

268
00:19:40,495 --> 00:19:46,365
- Uh, it had "lady" in there somewhere.
- It'll be on his credit-card bill.

269
00:19:46,835 --> 00:19:48,359
There you go.

270
00:19:48,537 --> 00:19:50,596
Pleasure meeting you, boys.

271
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:56,143
We're a full-service private practice.

272
00:19:56,812 --> 00:20:00,771
We deliver primary care,
uh, cosmetic surgery...

273
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:03,713
...psychotherapy, sports medicine,
you name it.

274
00:20:03,886 --> 00:20:05,376
What's the African connection?

275
00:20:05,854 --> 00:20:07,651
It's what this place is all about.

276
00:20:07,823 --> 00:20:10,758
Half our profits go to build
and staff basic health clinics...

277
00:20:10,926 --> 00:20:12,757
...in poor African communities.

278
00:20:13,929 --> 00:20:15,294
All right, here we are.

279
00:20:17,733 --> 00:20:18,995
It's a thin file.

280
00:20:20,102 --> 00:20:23,003
Alison was a healthy young woman.

281
00:20:23,171 --> 00:20:26,436
- Psychiatric history?
- She didn't have one.

282
00:20:26,608 --> 00:20:28,439
STDs? Abortions?

283
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:31,101
- Unexplained injuries?
- No.

284
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,182
Aside from some routine checkups with me,
it's all Dr. Tannen, all aesthetic work.

285
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:36,817
Did Tannen keep a diary?

286
00:20:37,219 --> 00:20:40,882
Our last case was solved
because the victim kept a diary.

287
00:20:41,056 --> 00:20:42,751
Diary? I don't think so.

288
00:20:42,925 --> 00:20:44,825
Getting back to Alison Randolph.

289
00:20:45,861 --> 00:20:48,261
How was her marriage, do you think?

290
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:50,022
Happy? Unhappy?

291
00:20:51,033 --> 00:20:54,628
About six months ago,
Dr. Tannen asked my advice.

292
00:20:56,204 --> 00:21:00,106
Alison asked him to get her a year's supply
of birth-control pills, off the books...

293
00:21:00,275 --> 00:21:02,470
...which is strictly against AMA code.

294
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:05,840
I said, "Sure, do it."

295
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:11,975
- Better us than some Tijuana drugstore.
- Why the secrecy?

296
00:21:12,921 --> 00:21:17,415
Price Randolph had a vasectomy,
April of '02.

297
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:22,290
- If there's anything else I can do...
- I appreciate that.

298
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:26,729
Actually, there is.
Uh, I'm out of sleeping pills.

299
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:30,535
Can you fix me up?
Anything strong will do.

300
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:34,403
Sure. Come in for a consultation.
We'll squeeze you in this afternoon.

301
00:21:34,576 --> 00:21:38,137
Oh, no, I was hoping to get something now.
Trying to avoid the chitchat.

302
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:45,517
I'm sorry. I wouldn't feel comfortable
prescribing without some sort of chitchat.

303
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:48,682
I understand. Uh, no problem.

304
00:21:48,857 --> 00:21:50,222
I'll call you.

305
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:51,825
Maybe.

306
00:21:54,196 --> 00:21:55,390
I like the husband for it.

307
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:59,694
He hires some hooker to create an alibi,
flies home, fillets the spouse, flies back.

308
00:21:59,868 --> 00:22:03,269
It's a classic, elaborate and clever,
but ultimately stupid plan.

309
00:22:03,438 --> 00:22:05,269
Have you looked
at his PGA tournament record?

310
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,034
It's not bad. Six mil career earnings.

311
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:12,146
For coming in second and third. Put him
on the 18th tee with a big one on the line...

312
00:22:12,314 --> 00:22:14,339
...like night follows day, he'll shank it.

313
00:22:14,516 --> 00:22:17,917
He's a choker. He doesn't have the nerve
to kill his wife. Didn't do it.

314
00:22:19,121 --> 00:22:22,784
Are you suggesting we drop a prime suspect
because he's never won a major?

315
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:26,359
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm just making idle conversation.

316
00:22:27,562 --> 00:22:28,790
How'd you do that?

317
00:22:30,499 --> 00:22:32,296
Telekinesis.

318
00:22:32,467 --> 00:22:33,934
He blew on it.

319
00:22:35,537 --> 00:22:37,528
That is another way to do it.

320
00:22:39,141 --> 00:22:43,407
Mr. Jane, I have a question
regarding your previous career path.

321
00:22:43,578 --> 00:22:45,011
Fire away.

322
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:48,115
When you met with other psychics,
real psychics...

323
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:50,751
...could they tell
you were just pretending?

324
00:22:50,919 --> 00:22:52,910
There's no such thing as real psychics.

325
00:22:53,088 --> 00:22:55,955
I beg to differ.
My cousin Yolanda's a psychic.

326
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:58,592
Your cousin is deluded or dishonest,
or both.

327
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:02,491
- Hey, steady.
- No. He's entitled to his opinion.

328
00:23:02,664 --> 00:23:04,063
He's wrong, though.

329
00:23:04,232 --> 00:23:05,756
- She has power.
- Thank you.

330
00:23:05,934 --> 00:23:09,165
She can communicate with the other side.
I've seen her do it myself.

331
00:23:09,337 --> 00:23:11,737
She let you speak
with someone that's gone?

332
00:23:11,907 --> 00:23:13,272
- Yes.
- Someone you love...

333
00:23:13,442 --> 00:23:16,775
- ...and still miss very much?
- Yes.

334
00:23:16,945 --> 00:23:19,436
You wanted her power to be real,
so it was.

335
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:21,506
No.

336
00:23:21,683 --> 00:23:24,345
You're sure you're right.
Science don't know everything.

337
00:23:24,519 --> 00:23:27,147
Five hundred years ago,
radio would've seemed like magic.

338
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:29,790
- Exactly.
- In the future, it could be totally normal...

339
00:23:29,958 --> 00:23:32,119
- ...to communicate with the other side.
- The other side?

340
00:23:32,294 --> 00:23:33,852
Mm-hm.

341
00:23:36,531 --> 00:23:38,829
Your father's a football coach, yeah?

342
00:23:39,568 --> 00:23:42,469
- How'd you know that?
- It's obvious from your whole demeanor.

343
00:23:42,637 --> 00:23:46,596
My point is,
didn't Dad always say life is like football?

344
00:23:46,775 --> 00:23:49,437
When that final whistle blows,
the game is over.

345
00:23:50,078 --> 00:23:53,605
Done. There is no more.
There is no other side.

346
00:23:53,782 --> 00:23:57,650
This is it. Lobster and bread rolls
and nautical kitsch, and then...

347
00:23:57,819 --> 00:23:59,446
...pfft, nothingness.

348
00:24:00,489 --> 00:24:04,789
You poor, sad man.
The Kingdom of God is a real place.

349
00:24:06,027 --> 00:24:09,793
Okay, later tonight, when Rigsby asks you
to come back to his hotel room...

350
00:24:14,503 --> 00:24:15,663
...say yes.

351
00:24:15,837 --> 00:24:16,861
Excuse me?

352
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:20,030
I know, you were planning on
refusing him very curtly.

353
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:24,372
First week on the job, you wanna set
a tone, no monkey business. But why not?

354
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:27,208
Rigsby's an excellent lover, I'm sure.

355
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:30,249
Tough, but fair. Right?

356
00:24:30,418 --> 00:24:31,715
Right.

357
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:39,185
The Kingdom of God is a real place,
Mr. Jane.

358
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:43,360
And you have an immortal soul.

359
00:24:43,532 --> 00:24:46,433
Oh, I do so hope you're wrong.

360
00:24:52,274 --> 00:24:53,298
- Good night.
- Night.

361
00:24:53,475 --> 00:24:55,375
Later, dude.

362
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:04,643
This is me.

363
00:25:08,857 --> 00:25:13,692
- Welcome to the unit, Agent Van Pelt.
- Thank you, Agent Rigsby.

364
00:25:14,362 --> 00:25:16,592
<i>She explodes into action.</i>

365
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:20,462
<i>Reaching up to 60 miles per hour...</i>

366
00:25:20,635 --> 00:25:24,628
<i>...she easily outruns her terrified prey.</i>

367
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:19,688
"Greetings, old friend. It's been a while.

368
00:26:19,861 --> 00:26:22,955
I hope you are keeping well.
I am thriving and happy.

369
00:26:23,131 --> 00:26:26,328
I have 12 wives now
and will soon begin courting Number 13.

370
00:26:27,435 --> 00:26:28,902
Why can't you catch me?

371
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:32,836
You must feel so powerless
and stupid and sad.

372
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:34,839
Oh, well. All the best.

373
00:26:36,044 --> 00:26:37,841
Red John."

374
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:40,004
That sounds like the real deal to me.

375
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:44,015
Sounds like Red John. It's not. Red John
wouldn't risk capture just to taunt me.

376
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:46,449
So the real killer's trying
to throw us off track?

377
00:26:46,621 --> 00:26:49,385
Cho, find out where Price Randolph was
a half an hour ago.

378
00:26:49,557 --> 00:26:53,049
Rigsby, check the hotel security cameras.
Get those over to Forensics.

379
00:26:59,467 --> 00:27:02,129
- You okay?
- Absolutely.

380
00:27:02,804 --> 00:27:04,465
Get some sleep.

381
00:27:42,477 --> 00:27:43,501
Hello.

382
00:27:43,678 --> 00:27:46,112
- Good morning.
- You didn't sleep, did you?

383
00:27:51,186 --> 00:27:54,622
Hi. I'd like to make an appointment
with Dr. Wagner, please. It's urgent.

384
00:27:54,789 --> 00:27:56,780
Jane. Patrick Jane.

385
00:27:56,958 --> 00:27:58,949
Yeah, I'll hold.

386
00:27:59,127 --> 00:28:00,458
Forensics maybe got a break.

387
00:28:01,029 --> 00:28:03,589
Blood on the cloth in the envelope
is Alison Randolph's.

388
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:07,758
But they found a hair in there,
doesn't belong to her or Tannen.

389
00:28:08,303 --> 00:28:09,861
Guess who it does belong to.

390
00:28:11,373 --> 00:28:13,102
It's yours, Tag. Amazing, huh?

391
00:28:17,846 --> 00:28:18,938
Science.

392
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:26,781
This is insane. I didn't...

393
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:28,445
<i>I didn't kill Alison.</i>

394
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:30,557
<i>How do you explain your hair?</i>

395
00:28:30,725 --> 00:28:34,593
<i>Either it was a mistake,</i>
<i>or I'm being framed.</i>

396
00:28:34,763 --> 00:28:35,991
<i>Who would wanna frame you?</i>

397
00:28:36,164 --> 00:28:38,064
<i>We don't want to,</i>
<i>if that's what you're thinking.</i>

398
00:28:38,233 --> 00:28:40,064
He and Alison were lovers.

399
00:28:40,235 --> 00:28:41,827
<i>Who would wanna frame you, Tag?</i>

400
00:28:43,905 --> 00:28:46,806
- <i>My brother.</i>
- <i>Why would he wanna do that?</i>

401
00:28:49,277 --> 00:28:50,710
<i>Alison and I were lovers.</i>

402
00:28:52,614 --> 00:28:55,447
I think you are psychic.
You're just afraid to admit it.

403
00:28:55,617 --> 00:28:57,084
Mm-hm.

404
00:28:58,353 --> 00:29:00,184
So...

405
00:29:03,725 --> 00:29:05,249
So, heh.

406
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:09,762
Why is it you can't sleep?

407
00:29:09,931 --> 00:29:13,594
Because I can't get the good pills
without talking to a doctor.

408
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:16,994
- And you don't like talking to doctors.
- Eh.

409
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:20,403
They always wanna be the smartest person
in the room, don't they?

410
00:29:20,575 --> 00:29:22,907
When, in fact, that's me, obviously.

411
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:30,678
You protect your core self very fiercely.

412
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:34,321
What do you think is the reason for that?

413
00:29:36,458 --> 00:29:39,086
You know,
this is exactly how I imagined it would be.

414
00:29:40,628 --> 00:29:42,619
You gonna ask me about my mother?

415
00:29:42,797 --> 00:29:46,096
- Do you want me to ask about your mother?
- I just wanna sleep.

416
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:49,901
So, what is it that keeps you awake?

417
00:29:51,606 --> 00:29:53,574
Oh, what's his name? Red John?

418
00:29:53,741 --> 00:29:59,111
That's right, Red John. Uh, he's killed
at least eight women that we know of.

419
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,646
Uh, the police asked me
to get a psychic fix on him...

420
00:30:01,816 --> 00:30:03,784
...to get a sense of who this man is.

421
00:30:03,952 --> 00:30:08,116
How do you do that exactly?
Get a psychic fix on someone.

422
00:30:08,756 --> 00:30:11,953
Well, Davis,
true demonic evil burns like fire.

423
00:30:12,126 --> 00:30:15,926
It burns with a terrible, cold, dark flame.

424
00:30:16,097 --> 00:30:19,089
<i>I force myself to look into that flame...</i>

425
00:30:19,267 --> 00:30:23,966
<i>...and I see an image of the evildoer.</i>
<i>In this case, Red John.</i>

426
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:29,073
<i>He's an ugly, tormented little man.</i>
<i>A lonely soul.</i>

427
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:32,771
<i>Sad. Very sad.</i>

428
00:30:53,034 --> 00:30:54,262
<i>"Dear Mr. Jane.</i>

429
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:56,300
<i>I do not like to be slandered</i>
<i>in the media...</i>

430
00:30:56,471 --> 00:30:58,564
<i>...especially by a dirty,</i>
<i>moneygrubbing fraud.</i>

431
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:00,071
<i>If you were a real psychic...</i>

432
00:31:00,241 --> 00:31:03,733
<i>...instead of a dishonest little worm,</i>
<i>you wouldn't need to open the door...</i>

433
00:31:03,912 --> 00:31:07,541
<i>...to see what I've done</i>
<i>to your lovely wife and child."</i>

434
00:31:16,491 --> 00:31:17,651
<i>Mr. Jane.</i>

435
00:31:18,593 --> 00:31:20,527
Mr. Jane?

436
00:31:21,663 --> 00:31:24,188
What is it that keeps you awake?

437
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,558
Um...

438
00:31:32,674 --> 00:31:36,132
You know, when I was a boy,
we had a farm.

439
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:38,336
There was a lot of work.

440
00:31:40,348 --> 00:31:43,840
- I was kind of a lazy kid.
- Yes?

441
00:31:48,089 --> 00:31:52,355
I'd always be trying to get my little brother,
Jimmy, to do my chores for me.

442
00:31:54,562 --> 00:31:58,521
One day, I promised him a dollar
if he'd cut the firewood.

443
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:01,430
- Heh.
- Well...

444
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:06,501
...he opened up an artery in his leg
on the saw, and he bled to death.

445
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:10,605
Died...

446
00:32:12,413 --> 00:32:13,675
...doing my chores for me.

447
00:32:20,254 --> 00:32:22,154
You know...

448
00:32:22,323 --> 00:32:27,420
...that's almost exactly the same thing
that happened to Johnny Cash.

449
00:32:27,595 --> 00:32:29,187
Is it really?

450
00:32:30,732 --> 00:32:32,461
Wow.

451
00:32:33,434 --> 00:32:34,799
That's spooky.

452
00:32:40,174 --> 00:32:42,267
- Mr. Randolph...
- Cut the crap. My brother's done nothing.

453
00:32:42,443 --> 00:32:45,503
You haven't got the stones to come
after me so you come after my family.

454
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,841
- That is flat-out persecution.
- What did we agree?

455
00:32:48,016 --> 00:32:51,713
Mr. Randolph, there's no intent to persecute
you. We are holding your brother...

456
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:55,378
...because we have evidence linking him
to the crime, and potential motive.

457
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:58,616
Whenever you weren't around, he was
banging your wife like a big bass drum.

458
00:33:00,328 --> 00:33:02,455
Tag and Alison?

459
00:33:05,299 --> 00:33:07,961
That's what he states.
He states that you killed Alison.

460
00:33:08,136 --> 00:33:10,661
- You're trying to frame him in revenge.
- What did you say?

461
00:33:10,838 --> 00:33:12,703
What...? There... Bastard.

462
00:33:12,874 --> 00:33:15,206
- Hey.
- You... Ow! Agh!

463
00:33:15,376 --> 00:33:17,674
- Son of a bitch.
- You treated her like crap.

464
00:33:17,845 --> 00:33:18,869
What'd you expect?

465
00:33:19,047 --> 00:33:22,380
I didn't expect my little brother
to be banging my wife, you bastard!

466
00:33:32,293 --> 00:33:35,057
Everything you told me is total fiction,
isn't it?

467
00:33:36,864 --> 00:33:38,491
Yes.

468
00:33:38,866 --> 00:33:40,390
Why?

469
00:33:40,568 --> 00:33:43,560
I can tell you're in real pain.
Why not tell the truth?

470
00:33:45,206 --> 00:33:46,764
The truth is mine.

471
00:33:50,712 --> 00:33:52,703
- I hear you.
- Thank you.

472
00:34:00,354 --> 00:34:02,914
Oh, yes.

473
00:34:03,891 --> 00:34:06,291
Remember, uh, we were talking
about Tannen the other day?

474
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:08,861
I asked you if he kept a diary,
and you said he did.

475
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:11,294
- Well, there's no diary among his effects.
- No.

476
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:12,524
I'm sorry, no?

477
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:16,399
No. You have it wrong.
I didn't think he kept a diary.

478
00:34:16,571 --> 00:34:18,471
Strange.

479
00:34:18,906 --> 00:34:21,568
Then it must've been someone else
who told me.

480
00:34:21,743 --> 00:34:23,404
Either that, or I'm going mad.

481
00:34:25,346 --> 00:34:29,442
But I definitely, 100 percent,
remember hearing that Tannen kept a diary.

482
00:34:29,617 --> 00:34:32,882
Well, that is strange.
But why does it matter if he kept a diary?

483
00:34:33,054 --> 00:34:34,385
You're right, doesn't matter.

484
00:34:34,555 --> 00:34:38,616
Only, I was thinking, why do magicians
have beautiful girl assistants?

485
00:34:39,894 --> 00:34:43,125
- Why?
- They're reliable distractors of attention.

486
00:34:43,297 --> 00:34:45,822
People will look at a beautiful girl
for a long time...

487
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,332
...before they look
where they should be looking...

488
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:51,301
...if they wanna see
how the trick really works.

489
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:54,974
I'll send over
a couple of Forensics guys tomorrow...

490
00:34:55,143 --> 00:34:57,338
...to search his office
and locate that diary.

491
00:34:57,512 --> 00:35:00,003
Didn't they already search his office?

492
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:02,445
Oh, they never do it thoroughly
the first time.

493
00:35:02,617 --> 00:35:03,777
Once more for luck, yeah?

494
00:35:04,786 --> 00:35:07,983
Gotta be there somewhere.
Thanks for everything, doc.

495
00:35:08,156 --> 00:35:10,522
Good night. Good night.

496
00:35:47,528 --> 00:35:49,393
Lost something?

497
00:35:50,832 --> 00:35:52,959
- How did you get in?
- Door was open.

498
00:35:53,134 --> 00:35:56,535
- I think I left my phone in your office.
- The door wasn't open.

499
00:35:56,704 --> 00:35:58,865
Must've been. Here I am.

500
00:36:04,378 --> 00:36:06,175
What are you doing?

501
00:36:09,183 --> 00:36:15,088
I confess, the temptation to play detective
was a little too strong.

502
00:36:15,523 --> 00:36:18,014
I was looking for that diary.

503
00:36:19,794 --> 00:36:22,558
- I got a little carried away.
- No kidding.

504
00:36:23,898 --> 00:36:25,627
But no diary?

505
00:36:26,234 --> 00:36:27,758
No diary.

506
00:36:29,403 --> 00:36:32,395
Maybe I should have a gander.
I'm good at finding things.

507
00:36:33,407 --> 00:36:34,897
Be my guest.

508
00:37:38,572 --> 00:37:39,596
Eureka.

509
00:37:45,279 --> 00:37:47,076
Dr. Wagner, thanks for your help.

510
00:37:56,757 --> 00:37:58,384
Mr. Jane...

511
00:37:58,559 --> 00:38:01,687
...uh, your phone.

512
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:03,523
Right. Ha.

513
00:38:05,299 --> 00:38:07,062
Thanks.

514
00:38:14,275 --> 00:38:16,436
Yeah, got it.

515
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:20,205
- Silly of me. Well, goodbye again.
- Wait.

516
00:38:23,417 --> 00:38:25,647
Give me the diary.

517
00:38:48,009 --> 00:38:50,170
- That's very amusing.
- I try.

518
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:59,379
I knew...
I knew it might be a trick, but I...

519
00:39:00,955 --> 00:39:05,187
- I had to be sure.
- Yes. That's how the trick works.

520
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:07,655
What led you to me?

521
00:39:08,662 --> 00:39:11,256
Not that I'm saying I did it.
I'm just asking.

522
00:39:11,832 --> 00:39:14,630
When we first met, you said
you didn't know who Red John was.

523
00:39:14,802 --> 00:39:20,172
But you have books on criminal psychiatry
there that have chapters on him.

524
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:22,436
You're the Randolph family doctor...

525
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:25,909
...so you could easily get
a strand of Tag's hair.

526
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:28,742
And, being a doctor...

527
00:39:29,483 --> 00:39:32,919
...you can hack up another human
without difficulty.

528
00:39:34,155 --> 00:39:36,055
It's obvious it was you.

529
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:39,358
That's it?

530
00:39:39,927 --> 00:39:42,020
You have nothing.

531
00:39:42,196 --> 00:39:44,926
- That's just guesswork.
- Oh, I know.

532
00:39:45,099 --> 00:39:47,863
I just wanted to be sure
I had the right answer.

533
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:55,433
I was surprised, I gotta be honest.
You don't seem to be a wicked man.

534
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:57,770
But you are.

535
00:40:00,948 --> 00:40:03,473
You're angry about the letter.

536
00:40:04,618 --> 00:40:07,485
Yeah, it was a bit mean-spirited.

537
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:11,624
For the record,
I'm sorry about your family.

538
00:40:12,393 --> 00:40:18,263
I can only imagine your pain.
But I'm not a wicked man.

539
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:21,499
- My conscience is clear.
- Really?

540
00:40:21,902 --> 00:40:26,168
Right now in Africa,
there's 3000 beautiful children alive today...

541
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:30,106
...who should be dead, but they aren't,
because of me.

542
00:40:31,112 --> 00:40:36,880
Tannen was gonna ruin me
and destroy all that work...

543
00:40:39,153 --> 00:40:41,587
...over nothing. Money.

544
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:45,249
Theft, he called it.

545
00:40:45,426 --> 00:40:49,522
Embezzlement. Self-righteous idiot.

546
00:40:50,631 --> 00:40:57,537
It's simple math.
If I go to jail, thousands of kids will die.

547
00:40:57,705 --> 00:41:03,666
So I made a rational, moral decision
to kill Tannen for the greater good.

548
00:41:03,844 --> 00:41:06,642
And Alison? What'd she do wrong?

549
00:41:07,615 --> 00:41:08,639
Mm.

550
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:13,042
As we said, she was the magician's
assistant, just a distraction.

551
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:15,085
- Ah.
- If only Tannen died...

552
00:41:15,256 --> 00:41:18,191
...the police would've
been all over this place, wouldn't they?

553
00:41:18,759 --> 00:41:22,559
Truly, is killing two
any worse than killing one...

554
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:25,597
...when so many lives are at stake?
I don't think so.

555
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:28,700
You poor, sad man.

556
00:41:28,869 --> 00:41:32,327
- You're under arrest. Let's go.
- I'm pointing a gun at you.

557
00:41:32,506 --> 00:41:37,307
You really think I would set you up so nicely
and let you pull a loaded gun on me?

558
00:41:38,078 --> 00:41:40,205
I took the bullets out earlier.

559
00:41:54,361 --> 00:41:57,228
- You're late. Draw your weapon.
- What? Huh?

560
00:41:57,831 --> 00:41:59,059
Drop the gun.

561
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:02,526
Hands on your head.
Get down on your knees.

562
00:42:02,703 --> 00:42:04,500
Down.

563
00:42:20,421 --> 00:42:21,945
Closed-case doughnuts are here.

564
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:35,863
I just went to get sleeping pills, I swear.
I didn't even wanna go.

565
00:42:36,036 --> 00:42:38,300
- You know I didn't wanna go.
- Right.

566
00:42:39,607 --> 00:42:41,768
Yeah, you didn't set Wagner up.

567
00:42:42,610 --> 00:42:44,373
Didn't figure it was him days ago.

568
00:42:44,545 --> 00:42:46,877
You didn't let us tear apart
the victim's family...

569
00:42:47,047 --> 00:42:49,038
...to satisfy your childish need for drama.

570
00:42:49,216 --> 00:42:52,276
Hey, that family was screwed anyway.
Don't blame yourselves, guys.

571
00:43:11,905 --> 00:43:14,897
Don't even start. I'm still angry.

572
00:43:15,309 --> 00:43:17,573
- I'm sorry.
- No, you're not.

573
00:43:24,652 --> 00:43:29,351
A frog? Well,
this makes everything better, doesn't it?

574
00:43:30,305 --> 00:44:30,598
