1
00:00:02,263 --> 00:00:05,396
The number is 30.

2
00:00:05,483 --> 00:00:07,311
Two days ago,
you said it was 15.

3
00:00:07,398 --> 00:00:09,879
Things have changed.

4
00:00:09,966 --> 00:00:11,228
What things, Curt?

5
00:00:11,315 --> 00:00:14,101
Demand is strong,
supply is weak.

6
00:00:14,188 --> 00:00:16,059
It's Economics 101, my brother.

7
00:00:16,146 --> 00:00:17,950
- 100% bump in two days...
- That is not economics.

8
00:00:17,974 --> 00:00:19,497
That is robbery.

9
00:00:19,584 --> 00:00:21,673
This inflation thing is real.

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,894
Supply chain issues,
labor shortages...

11
00:00:24,981 --> 00:00:27,418
Prices are skyrocketing.

12
00:00:27,505 --> 00:00:29,594
Is this guy a bomb broker
or an economist?

13
00:00:29,681 --> 00:00:31,988
Worth every penny.

14
00:00:32,075 --> 00:00:33,075
Take a look for yourself.

15
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,253
Snapped that earlier today.

16
00:00:38,473 --> 00:00:41,737
25 blocks of C4,
two trigger mechanisms.

17
00:00:41,824 --> 00:00:44,131
I mean, listen,
I could go on and on.

18
00:00:44,218 --> 00:00:45,871
But the only thing
that really matters

19
00:00:45,958 --> 00:00:47,958
is the damn thing can blow up
an entire city block.

20
00:00:48,004 --> 00:00:48,657
Looks good.

21
00:00:48,744 --> 00:00:50,224
Is he bluffing?

22
00:00:50,311 --> 00:00:52,052
I sure hope so.

23
00:00:52,139 --> 00:00:54,054
25 and we got a deal.

24
00:00:55,794 --> 00:00:58,058
20 is the highest
I'm willing to go.

25
00:00:58,145 --> 00:01:00,582
And I have it all
right here with me, too.

26
00:01:05,413 --> 00:01:07,154
Cool.

27
00:01:07,241 --> 00:01:09,678
I think we got a deal.

28
00:01:09,765 --> 00:01:13,551
So I just got to see the cash,
and we're good to go.

29
00:01:16,206 --> 00:01:17,806
I'm really glad
we're doing this, Curt.

30
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:19,470
Me too.

31
00:01:19,557 --> 00:01:20,926
And please don't tell me
what you're planning to do

32
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:22,647
with the damn thing.

33
00:01:22,734 --> 00:01:23,822
Don't want to know.

34
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:25,520
Fair enough.

35
00:01:29,263 --> 00:01:30,916
Feel free to count it.

36
00:01:33,354 --> 00:01:35,443
OK.

37
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:36,661
Cool.

38
00:01:36,748 --> 00:01:38,228
Come with me.

39
00:01:38,315 --> 00:01:40,143
- I'll follow you in my car.
- No.

40
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:43,233
Come with me...

41
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,323
in my car.

42
00:01:49,848 --> 00:01:53,025
Hey, it feels like a rip.

43
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:53,983
Like I said,
I'll follow you in...

44
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:57,029
Come with me or no deal.

45
00:02:04,994 --> 00:02:07,039
OK, buddy.

46
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:08,650
Not a problem.

47
00:02:14,482 --> 00:02:17,963
- Hey, Omar.
- Do not get in that car.

48
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,188
Relax, bro.

49
00:02:26,885 --> 00:02:28,670
You got to learn
to trust people.

50
00:02:28,757 --> 00:02:30,324
Yeah.

51
00:02:30,411 --> 00:02:31,760
Sorry, I'm a little paranoid.

52
00:02:31,847 --> 00:02:33,718
And the more someone
tells me to trust them,

53
00:02:33,805 --> 00:02:35,720
the more I don't, Curt.

54
00:02:35,807 --> 00:02:37,157
I respect that.

55
00:02:39,768 --> 00:02:41,639
We're here.

56
00:02:41,726 --> 00:02:43,424
OK.

57
00:03:02,138 --> 00:03:03,966
You're going to like
Anish, my partner.

58
00:03:04,053 --> 00:03:05,750
This guy is smart as hell.

59
00:03:05,837 --> 00:03:08,536
Went to MIT, like for real.

60
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,061
What the...

61
00:03:15,847 --> 00:03:17,762
Anish?

62
00:03:21,113 --> 00:03:23,246
Anish?

63
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:26,554
You alive?

64
00:03:26,641 --> 00:03:28,730
There's no pulse.

65
00:03:32,429 --> 00:03:33,841
No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

66
00:03:33,865 --> 00:03:35,215
This can't be happening.

67
00:03:35,302 --> 00:03:37,869
What the hell is going on?

68
00:03:37,956 --> 00:03:40,829
OA, we need to know
if that bomb is there.

69
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:41,917
Stay in character.

70
00:03:42,004 --> 00:03:44,746
- Uh, OK.
- Uh...

71
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:46,922
OK, look, hey, hey.

72
00:03:47,009 --> 00:03:48,726
I don't want to be that guy,
but we're not going to be able

73
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,882
to bring your buddy
back to life, right?

74
00:03:50,969 --> 00:03:52,449
So let's get through
with the deal.

75
00:03:52,536 --> 00:03:53,861
And let's get the hell
out of here.

76
00:03:53,885 --> 00:03:55,254
- What do you say?
- That sounds good.

77
00:03:55,278 --> 00:03:57,038
- Just, uh, follow me.
- All right, let's go.

78
00:04:05,419 --> 00:04:07,812
- Ugh.
- What?

79
00:04:07,899 --> 00:04:10,511
I... I... I don't know where... I...

80
00:04:15,472 --> 00:04:17,474
Sorry, is this
some kind of game to you?

81
00:04:17,561 --> 00:04:18,712
- Are you playing with me?
- Hell no.

82
00:04:18,736 --> 00:04:20,172
I'm... I'm just trying to...

83
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,696
You said there was a bomb here.

84
00:04:21,783 --> 00:04:23,151
That is why we are here, Curt.
Where is the bomb?

85
00:04:23,175 --> 00:04:24,936
- I told you, I don't know.
- Where is the bomb?

86
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,960
Back off.

87
00:04:27,571 --> 00:04:28,920
Let's go.

88
00:04:32,097 --> 00:04:34,012
Curt Mallory,
you are under arrest.

89
00:04:34,099 --> 00:04:36,406
Who the hell are you?

90
00:04:36,493 --> 00:04:39,279
FBI.

91
00:04:44,196 --> 00:04:45,720
Thanks for breakfast.

92
00:04:45,807 --> 00:04:47,156
- Yeah, yeah.
- Well...

93
00:04:47,243 --> 00:04:48,592
It's nice.

94
00:04:48,679 --> 00:04:50,377
- It felt like old times.
- Really?

95
00:04:50,464 --> 00:04:51,682
See you tonight?

96
00:04:51,769 --> 00:04:54,642
- Yeah, of course.
- It's your birthday.

97
00:04:54,729 --> 00:04:56,557
You only turn 15 once, right?

98
00:04:56,644 --> 00:04:59,821
You said that last year
when I turned 14.

99
00:04:59,908 --> 00:05:01,126
Well, it was also true then.

100
00:05:01,213 --> 00:05:03,607
Hey, you need a taxi?

101
00:05:03,694 --> 00:05:05,368
No, I'll just use one
of my ride share apps.

102
00:05:05,392 --> 00:05:06,552
- You sure?
- It's right here.

103
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:09,265
- Yeah, I know.
- But cabs are lame.

104
00:05:09,352 --> 00:05:11,485
- Cabs are lame.
- Oh, OK.

105
00:05:11,572 --> 00:05:13,269
Well, whatever you want.

106
00:05:13,356 --> 00:05:16,228
I can get you a horse-drawn
carriage, if you'd rather.

107
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:20,929
Maybe a rickshaw if
that's more your speed?

108
00:05:21,016 --> 00:05:22,583
Well, that's the first time

109
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:25,281
I've seen him smile
in a few weeks.

110
00:05:27,239 --> 00:05:29,111
Yeah, what do you mean?

111
00:05:31,548 --> 00:05:33,829
He's just going through one
of those teenage boy phases.

112
00:05:34,899 --> 00:05:37,293
Right.

113
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:38,900
So you're picking up
the cake, right?

114
00:05:38,947 --> 00:05:40,296
Uh, yeah, yeah.

115
00:05:40,383 --> 00:05:42,429
No, I know an amazing place.

116
00:05:42,516 --> 00:05:44,256
Great, well,
stop by around 7:00 or so.

117
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,432
- Yep.
- It'll be fun...

118
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:48,086
10 kids, pizza, video games.

119
00:05:48,173 --> 00:05:50,001
Yeah, it sounds perfect.

120
00:05:50,088 --> 00:05:51,176
Let me guess.

121
00:05:51,263 --> 00:05:52,569
All right, I'll see you.

122
00:05:52,656 --> 00:05:54,963
Ty, I love you.
See you tonight.

123
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:00,316
Hey, Isobel. What's up?

124
00:06:00,403 --> 00:06:02,013
Yeah, I'll be there
in 10 minutes.

125
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,364
All right, let's check
for chemicals, prints, DNA.

126
00:06:04,451 --> 00:06:06,453
I'm guessing they didn't
just store the bomb here.

127
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,280
Probably built it here, too.

128
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,674
OK, Curt, the more you
tell us, the more you help,

129
00:06:10,761 --> 00:06:12,043
the lighter your
sentence is going to be.

130
00:06:12,067 --> 00:06:13,547
Do you understand?

131
00:06:13,634 --> 00:06:14,654
You're only going to get
one bite at this apple.

132
00:06:14,678 --> 00:06:17,115
So you better make it count.

133
00:06:17,202 --> 00:06:20,554
Like I told you, Ramy,
or whatever your real name is...

134
00:06:20,641 --> 00:06:21,946
It is Omar.

135
00:06:22,033 --> 00:06:24,079
OK, Omar, like I told you,

136
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:26,168
I had no idea any of this
was going to happen.

137
00:06:26,255 --> 00:06:28,475
None.
I liked Anish, a lot.

138
00:06:28,562 --> 00:06:30,041
We were friends.

139
00:06:30,128 --> 00:06:31,869
OK, I believe you for now.

140
00:06:31,956 --> 00:06:33,876
But you got to give us
something that we can use.

141
00:06:33,915 --> 00:06:35,656
Did anybody else
know about this bomb?

142
00:06:35,743 --> 00:06:38,920
You have any other
potential buyers?

143
00:06:39,007 --> 00:06:40,443
One.

144
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:42,793
I met with him earlier today,

145
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,187
about an hour
before I met with Omar.

146
00:06:45,274 --> 00:06:46,710
What did you discuss?

147
00:06:46,797 --> 00:06:48,016
Price.

148
00:06:48,103 --> 00:06:49,583
Guy didn't have a lot of money.

149
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:51,933
But he was eager to do
the deal, too eager.

150
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,718
I-I got nervous.

151
00:06:54,805 --> 00:06:57,591
I thought he might have been
a cop, so I blew him off.

152
00:06:57,678 --> 00:06:59,288
OK, what was his name?

153
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:01,812
I think he said his name
was Nate, something like that.

154
00:07:01,899 --> 00:07:03,510
I don't know his last name.

155
00:07:03,597 --> 00:07:04,791
How did you get in
contact with Nate?

156
00:07:04,815 --> 00:07:06,077
Do you have his phone number?

157
00:07:06,164 --> 00:07:07,403
No, we did it through
encrypted chat.

158
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,429
- What did he look like...
- Height, build?

159
00:07:09,516 --> 00:07:12,823
Short dark hair, medium height.

160
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:15,739
We need to know what time
and where you met with Nate,

161
00:07:15,826 --> 00:07:17,262
what street.

162
00:07:17,349 --> 00:07:20,178
Be as specific as you can.

163
00:07:23,355 --> 00:07:25,227
- Hey.
- What's going on?

164
00:07:25,314 --> 00:07:26,900
OA said this thing was
just getting started.

165
00:07:26,924 --> 00:07:28,360
- Well, things accelerated.
- Yeah.

166
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,624
After weeks of talking
in a chat room,

167
00:07:30,711 --> 00:07:32,321
OA finally met with the broker.

168
00:07:32,408 --> 00:07:34,192
The plan was to
establish credibility,

169
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:35,866
do a quick money flash,
but the guy was ready to roll.

170
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:37,326
So OA went for it.

171
00:07:37,413 --> 00:07:38,564
And when they went
to retrieve the device,

172
00:07:38,588 --> 00:07:39,328
the broker's partner was dead.

173
00:07:39,415 --> 00:07:41,199
And the bomb was missing.

174
00:07:41,286 --> 00:07:43,941
Uh-huh, so we have a killer
in the wind with a bomb?

175
00:07:44,028 --> 00:07:45,702
Well, according to the specs,
the broker rattled off,

176
00:07:45,726 --> 00:07:46,944
it is not just a bomb.

177
00:07:47,031 --> 00:07:48,380
It's a big bomb.

178
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:51,471
We're talking Oklahoma City.

179
00:07:51,558 --> 00:07:52,863
Copy that.

180
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:54,580
All right, I'll start
digging into the details

181
00:07:54,604 --> 00:07:57,564
and go to work.

182
00:07:57,651 --> 00:07:58,260
How are we doing
with that video?

183
00:07:58,347 --> 00:07:59,914
- Good.
- Yeah?

184
00:08:00,001 --> 00:08:01,326
Just pulled some from
an ATM across the street.

185
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:02,873
OK, yeah, yeah, yeah.

186
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,222
OK, there's our broker, Curt.

187
00:08:04,309 --> 00:08:07,269
And that must be our suspect.

188
00:08:07,356 --> 00:08:09,576
Can we get a better angle
on his face?

189
00:08:09,663 --> 00:08:11,229
This is the best I can do.

190
00:08:11,316 --> 00:08:13,318
Did you have any luck
with facial rec?

191
00:08:17,018 --> 00:08:18,604
- No, nothing.
- All right, keep looking.

192
00:08:18,628 --> 00:08:20,238
There's got to be another angle.

193
00:08:20,325 --> 00:08:21,565
Yep, found another street cam.

194
00:08:21,631 --> 00:08:22,371
All right, let's keep it going.

195
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:23,981
Throw it up.

196
00:08:24,068 --> 00:08:25,393
All right, I don't
know about his face.

197
00:08:25,417 --> 00:08:26,612
But we can definitely
see his car.

198
00:08:26,636 --> 00:08:27,836
Get that license plate number.

199
00:08:27,898 --> 00:08:30,684
Yep, yep, running it now.

200
00:08:30,771 --> 00:08:32,512
OK, Jorge Rubio...

201
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:34,296
Short dark hair, medium height.

202
00:08:34,383 --> 00:08:35,993
That matches Curt's description.

203
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,605
But the bomb broker
said his name was Nate.

204
00:08:38,692 --> 00:08:40,302
I used to say I was 6' 3".

205
00:08:40,389 --> 00:08:42,957
Find me that address now.

206
00:08:44,611 --> 00:08:46,700
Hey, what's going on?

207
00:08:46,787 --> 00:08:48,919
Only three kids have RSVPed.

208
00:08:49,006 --> 00:08:50,573
They're boys.

209
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,290
They probably don't even know
what RSVP means, right?

210
00:08:52,314 --> 00:08:54,403
Yeah, but their parents do.

211
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:56,753
Right, OK, well,
we'll just have to wait

212
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,103
and see who shows up tonight,
OK?

213
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:00,777
OK, you're not listening
to what I'm saying.

214
00:09:00,801 --> 00:09:01,921
- I am.
- But what can we do?

215
00:09:01,976 --> 00:09:03,847
We can't control who RSVPs
and who doesn't

216
00:09:03,934 --> 00:09:05,545
or who comes and who doesn't.

217
00:09:05,632 --> 00:09:07,851
All I'm saying is,
we will make it work.

218
00:09:07,938 --> 00:09:11,333
And all I'm saying is
I'm worried about Tyler.

219
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,640
He's not as secure and
confident as you think he is.

220
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:15,946
- What do you...
- What do you mean?

221
00:09:16,033 --> 00:09:18,470
He's having a hard time
making friends.

222
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:21,212
Well, that's what
high school is about,

223
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:23,998
you know, figuring out who
you like, who you don't like...

224
00:09:24,085 --> 00:09:28,045
Jubal, he eats his lunch
alone in the library.

225
00:09:28,132 --> 00:09:29,699
And...

226
00:09:29,786 --> 00:09:32,397
last night, I heard him
crying in his bedroom.

227
00:09:32,484 --> 00:09:33,877
I asked him what was wrong.

228
00:09:33,964 --> 00:09:35,966
He didn't want to talk about it.

229
00:09:36,053 --> 00:09:38,360
He's really insecure
about his health...

230
00:09:38,447 --> 00:09:40,797
The leukemia.

231
00:09:40,884 --> 00:09:42,538
He won't admit it to me or you,

232
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:44,627
but it's really affecting him.

233
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:51,373
He'll be OK.

234
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,722
- He's tough.
- Hey.

235
00:09:52,809 --> 00:09:53,984
- Sorry to interrupt.
- Yeah?

236
00:09:54,071 --> 00:09:54,898
We got an address
on the suspect.

237
00:09:54,985 --> 00:09:56,900
OK.

238
00:09:56,987 --> 00:09:58,423
I got to go.

239
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:01,470
It's going to be fine.
I promise.

240
00:10:30,238 --> 00:10:31,631
Hands up!

241
00:10:31,718 --> 00:10:33,284
Shut off the music.

242
00:10:33,371 --> 00:10:34,697
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what's going on?

243
00:10:34,721 --> 00:10:35,809
Who are you?

244
00:10:35,896 --> 00:10:37,767
What... what are
you doing in here?

245
00:10:39,769 --> 00:10:41,031
Any chemicals or components?

246
00:10:41,118 --> 00:10:42,816
Nothing.

247
00:10:42,903 --> 00:10:44,271
OK, can somebody please tell
me what the hell is going on?

248
00:10:44,295 --> 00:10:45,601
Yeah, but not in here.

249
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,128
Where's your car?

250
00:10:51,215 --> 00:10:53,087
- My... my car?
- Why?

251
00:10:53,174 --> 00:10:55,263
We're investigating a homicide.

252
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:56,544
We have reason to believe
that you were speaking

253
00:10:56,568 --> 00:10:57,874
with the victim today.

254
00:10:57,961 --> 00:10:59,156
Discussing the purchase
of a bomb.

255
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:00,703
What?

256
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:04,228
Oh... OK, now you really lost me.

257
00:11:04,315 --> 00:11:05,882
Is this some kind of joke?

258
00:11:05,969 --> 00:11:07,231
A bomb?

259
00:11:07,318 --> 00:11:09,625
Well, I-I sell
life insurance, man.

260
00:11:09,712 --> 00:11:12,019
We have a video of your car.

261
00:11:12,106 --> 00:11:14,238
- The Toyota?
- I sold that three days ago.

262
00:11:14,325 --> 00:11:16,240
I just haven't filled out
the DMV paperwork yet.

263
00:11:16,327 --> 00:11:17,938
Who'd you sell it to?

264
00:11:18,025 --> 00:11:19,548
A guy named Nathan.

265
00:11:19,635 --> 00:11:21,811
He lives down the block
with my buddy, Tony.

266
00:11:21,898 --> 00:11:24,118
This guy?

267
00:11:24,205 --> 00:11:25,728
Yeah, yeah.

268
00:11:25,815 --> 00:11:26,860
OK, last name?

269
00:11:26,947 --> 00:11:28,949
- I don't know.
- I didn't ask.

270
00:11:29,036 --> 00:11:30,341
He paid cash for the car.

271
00:11:30,428 --> 00:11:31,797
All right, you said
he lives down the block.

272
00:11:31,821 --> 00:11:33,518
What house?
And I want the exact address.

273
00:11:52,146 --> 00:11:54,322
I need an ambulance
in my location ASAP.

274
00:11:54,409 --> 00:11:56,541
Sir, sir, can you hear me?

275
00:11:56,628 --> 00:11:58,041
Can you hear me, sir?
What's your name?

276
00:11:58,065 --> 00:11:59,762
Is Nathan here?

277
00:11:59,849 --> 00:12:01,459
No, he...

278
00:12:01,546 --> 00:12:03,635
Is he the one who shot you?

279
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:06,029
I tried to stop him.

280
00:12:06,116 --> 00:12:07,857
He's going to kill
a lot of people.

281
00:12:07,944 --> 00:12:09,903
Nathan... does he have a bomb?

282
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:12,470
Where is he going?

283
00:12:12,557 --> 00:12:15,343
Do you know where he's going?

284
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:18,346
Can you hear me?

285
00:12:18,433 --> 00:12:20,217
He's gone.

286
00:12:31,054 --> 00:12:34,014
His driver's license says
that his name is Tony Wilton.

287
00:12:34,101 --> 00:12:35,798
Well, that would make sense.

288
00:12:35,885 --> 00:12:37,558
Jorge said that Nathan lives
with a guy named Tony.

289
00:12:37,582 --> 00:12:39,933
You think he was heading
into work or coming home?

290
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:41,586
Shirt looks freshly pressed.

291
00:12:41,673 --> 00:12:44,154
I would say his day
was just starting.

292
00:12:46,896 --> 00:12:48,942
Tony's dead?

293
00:12:49,029 --> 00:12:50,595
You think Nathan did it?

294
00:12:50,682 --> 00:12:51,814
I'm not sure.

295
00:12:51,901 --> 00:12:53,226
Hoping you can help us
figure that out.

296
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:54,861
I don't know.

297
00:12:54,948 --> 00:12:57,472
But things between the two
of them weren't working out.

298
00:12:57,559 --> 00:13:00,605
Tony said he liked the guy
when they first met.

299
00:13:00,692 --> 00:13:02,520
But when the dude moved in,
things got weird.

300
00:13:02,607 --> 00:13:03,783
In what way?

301
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,523
He was too intense.

302
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:07,612
He was too angry.

303
00:13:07,699 --> 00:13:09,223
He wanted him to move out.

304
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:10,766
He asked if I could help
get rid of him.

305
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,704
But I didn't want any
part of that drama.

306
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,055
The dude was scary.

307
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,234
Looks like you made
the right choice.

308
00:13:24,978 --> 00:13:26,893
This is weird, right?

309
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:29,373
Yeah, I recognize some
of those faces, though.

310
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,698
They're all conservative
right-wingers

311
00:13:30,722 --> 00:13:33,290
who've been in the news.

312
00:13:33,377 --> 00:13:35,379
Dog alerted to the back room.

313
00:13:35,466 --> 00:13:37,227
The bomb was here,
but there's no sign of it now.

314
00:13:37,251 --> 00:13:38,513
OK, what about any guns?

315
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,081
No, but a lot of
extremist paraphernalia...

316
00:13:41,168 --> 00:13:43,561
Books, protest, signs,
all railing against the right.

317
00:13:43,648 --> 00:13:45,235
Well, that could be why
he and the missing roommate

318
00:13:45,259 --> 00:13:46,651
wanted a bomb.

319
00:13:46,738 --> 00:13:49,132
So let's get this scrubbed ASAP.

320
00:13:49,219 --> 00:13:51,265
- Can you get this to the JOC?
- Yes, sir.

321
00:14:01,884 --> 00:14:02,929
All right, folks.

322
00:14:03,016 --> 00:14:04,495
Let's talk about this.

323
00:14:04,582 --> 00:14:06,541
Our suspect... let's
call him Nathan for now,

324
00:14:06,628 --> 00:14:07,997
no last name... is out there
somewhere with the bomb.

325
00:14:08,021 --> 00:14:09,941
And it doesn't take a genius
to do the math here.

326
00:14:10,023 --> 00:14:12,304
If you're willing to kill to
get something that goes boom,

327
00:14:12,373 --> 00:14:13,765
you are going to use it.

328
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,419
So let's talk about
possible targets.

329
00:14:15,506 --> 00:14:16,788
Let's talk about whether
we think this guy

330
00:14:16,812 --> 00:14:17,857
is working solo now.

331
00:14:17,944 --> 00:14:19,162
Possibly.

332
00:14:19,249 --> 00:14:20,772
Preliminary ballistic
report confirms

333
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,750
the gun that killed the
bomb-maker also killed Tony.

334
00:14:22,774 --> 00:14:26,126
Right, OK, so maybe we're
dealing with a lone wolf.

335
00:14:26,213 --> 00:14:27,823
Problem is that wolf
is an enigma.

336
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:29,496
So let's talk about
our dead caterer, Tony.

337
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,933
So far, nobody we've
talked to in his family

338
00:14:30,957 --> 00:14:32,001
has even heard of Nathan.

339
00:14:32,088 --> 00:14:33,283
But what else do
we know about him?

340
00:14:33,307 --> 00:14:34,414
Tony was arrested
twice for failure

341
00:14:34,438 --> 00:14:36,092
to disperse at protests.

342
00:14:36,179 --> 00:14:37,722
But nothing in his past
indicates he's willing to kill

343
00:14:37,746 --> 00:14:38,921
for those beliefs.

344
00:14:39,008 --> 00:14:39,879
Doesn't mean his friend isn't.

345
00:14:39,966 --> 00:14:41,358
Maybe that was their beef.

346
00:14:41,445 --> 00:14:42,988
Is there any name on the
paperwork at Tony's,

347
00:14:43,012 --> 00:14:45,101
besides his... a utility bill,

348
00:14:45,188 --> 00:14:46,862
maybe a rent check made out
from this Nathan character?

349
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,801
None, there's no visible
money trail between the two.

350
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,978
- Any prints or DNA?
- ERT scrubbed the place.

351
00:14:52,065 --> 00:14:54,719
Only managed to find partial
prints and DNA strands,

352
00:14:54,806 --> 00:14:55,677
nothing conclusive.

353
00:14:55,764 --> 00:14:57,157
Come on, guys.

354
00:14:57,244 --> 00:14:58,680
We need a name,
an email address,

355
00:14:58,767 --> 00:15:00,116
phone number, something.

356
00:15:00,203 --> 00:15:01,528
Yeah, well, I've been
scrubbing the laptop

357
00:15:01,552 --> 00:15:03,032
we've recovered
from Tony's house.

358
00:15:03,119 --> 00:15:05,252
Located a few texts from
some chat between him

359
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:07,515
and a guy calling himself
Nate Nation.

360
00:15:07,602 --> 00:15:08,733
I'm guessing that's Nathan.

361
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,300
What'd they say?

362
00:15:10,387 --> 00:15:12,694
So the few dated two weeks ago
are kind of general.

363
00:15:12,781 --> 00:15:14,826
Looks like they bonded
over their beliefs.

364
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,133
Both felt the right
was destroying our democracy.

365
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:20,006
OK, so that is our
top contender for the why.

366
00:15:20,093 --> 00:15:21,853
Now I'll give you a gold star
if you can find me something

367
00:15:21,877 --> 00:15:23,835
more substantive
than political gripes,

368
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,012
something that will actually
help us catch this guy.

369
00:15:26,099 --> 00:15:28,666
OK, here's one from
less than a week ago.

370
00:15:28,753 --> 00:15:31,104
Tony told Nathan he had an
upcoming catering job that was

371
00:15:31,191 --> 00:15:32,844
a perfect target
for them to focus on,

372
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,411
one that would
generate headlines.

373
00:15:34,498 --> 00:15:36,065
All right,
did he say anything else

374
00:15:36,152 --> 00:15:38,894
about this catering job...
Where it was, what it was for?

375
00:15:38,981 --> 00:15:40,417
No, nothing.

376
00:15:40,504 --> 00:15:42,028
All right, get Tiffany and Scola

377
00:15:42,115 --> 00:15:43,831
over to that catering company,
see if we can figure out

378
00:15:43,855 --> 00:15:45,137
what function Tony
was talking about.

379
00:15:45,161 --> 00:15:48,469
Right.

380
00:15:48,556 --> 00:15:51,341
Things have slowed down a lot
because of COVID, the economy.

381
00:15:51,428 --> 00:15:52,995
But we're still pretty busy.

382
00:15:53,082 --> 00:15:55,432
There's a wedding in two days

383
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:56,999
then a software
engineering conference

384
00:15:57,043 --> 00:15:58,044
three days after that.

385
00:15:58,131 --> 00:16:00,089
Mind if I take a look?

386
00:16:00,176 --> 00:16:01,438
Thanks.

387
00:16:01,525 --> 00:16:03,832
OK, first function's
in two days.

388
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:06,835
OK, so look, Tony was wearing
a uniform when he was killed.

389
00:16:06,922 --> 00:16:08,726
Is there anything else that
might be on the schedule

390
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,665
you could think of?

391
00:16:10,752 --> 00:16:13,407
Some conference at a hotel
out in North port... the Links.

392
00:16:13,494 --> 00:16:16,671
But that already started
about 10 minutes ago.

393
00:16:16,758 --> 00:16:18,629
And, yeah, Tony was
supposed to be there.

394
00:16:18,716 --> 00:16:21,023
Can you pull up
the information for that event?

395
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:23,460
Lunch to be served
after a keynote speech

396
00:16:23,547 --> 00:16:25,612
by Judge Edward Saunders of the
Southern District of New York.

397
00:16:25,636 --> 00:16:28,770
Hey, Tiff.

398
00:16:28,857 --> 00:16:31,251
- Give me one second.
- Hard-core conservative, OK?

399
00:16:31,338 --> 00:16:32,778
He's been in the news
a lot recently,

400
00:16:32,861 --> 00:16:34,360
praising the Supreme Court's
recent rulings

401
00:16:34,384 --> 00:16:37,170
on abortion, gun rights.

402
00:16:37,257 --> 00:16:38,886
So if he's the guest
of honor, most likely

403
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:40,671
the attendees have the
same political leaning.

404
00:16:40,695 --> 00:16:43,480
Which means this conference
is one hell of a target

405
00:16:43,567 --> 00:16:45,439
for a guy like Nathan.

406
00:16:45,526 --> 00:16:48,224
OK, I'ma call this in.

407
00:16:51,836 --> 00:16:53,142
Hey, what's up?

408
00:16:53,229 --> 00:16:54,946
Hey, I just got off
the phone with the ADIC.

409
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:56,687
He feels strongly that we need
to move cautiously on this.

410
00:16:56,711 --> 00:16:58,123
He doesn't want to shut down
the conference

411
00:16:58,147 --> 00:17:00,062
without something
more substantial.

412
00:17:00,149 --> 00:17:02,456
It's the Federalist Society
we're talking about here.

413
00:17:02,543 --> 00:17:03,607
There's too many ways
it could backfire.

414
00:17:03,631 --> 00:17:05,111
If it turns out
to be a false alarm,

415
00:17:05,198 --> 00:17:06,871
we'll be the lead on every
right-wing news channel

416
00:17:06,895 --> 00:17:07,983
for the next few months.

417
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:09,463
All right, copy that.

418
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:10,420
Deploy agents
to that golf course.

419
00:17:10,507 --> 00:17:11,769
Tell them to stay tucked away.

420
00:17:11,856 --> 00:17:13,530
And if we get eyes
on Nathan or his vehicle,

421
00:17:13,554 --> 00:17:15,904
we evacuate immediately.

422
00:17:15,991 --> 00:17:18,689
Oh, they caught a break.

423
00:17:18,776 --> 00:17:20,213
Kelly, what's up?
I'm right here.

424
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,823
- Yeah.
- Just got a hit in Queens.

425
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:23,322
Car we're looking for
went down a dead end street

426
00:17:23,346 --> 00:17:24,695
26 minutes ago.

427
00:17:24,782 --> 00:17:26,088
- OK, what then?
- Don't know.

428
00:17:26,175 --> 00:17:27,500
- Hasn't reappeared yet.
- Keep looking.

429
00:17:27,524 --> 00:17:29,091
- OK.
- Queens.

430
00:17:29,178 --> 00:17:30,590
That's nowhere near
the Link's conference center.

431
00:17:30,614 --> 00:17:32,157
- Well, it doesn't matter.
- That's where the car is,

432
00:17:32,181 --> 00:17:34,357
which means Nathan and the bomb
may be nearby.

433
00:17:34,444 --> 00:17:36,751
- Get OA and Nina over there.
- Yep.

434
00:17:43,192 --> 00:17:44,846
- That's our car.
- Heads up.

435
00:17:44,933 --> 00:17:47,196
There's someone in the
driver's side door.

436
00:17:53,942 --> 00:17:55,117
- FBI.
- Get out of the car.

437
00:17:55,204 --> 00:17:56,640
Hands where we can see them.

438
00:18:01,776 --> 00:18:04,257
All right,
hands behind your back.

439
00:18:10,393 --> 00:18:11,829
OK, where's Nathan?

440
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:13,440
Who's Nathan?

441
00:18:16,443 --> 00:18:18,314
- Ain't mine.
- I found that.

442
00:18:18,401 --> 00:18:20,838
Don't play dumb and sit down.

443
00:18:20,925 --> 00:18:23,145
OK, pop the trunk.

444
00:18:38,943 --> 00:18:40,249
It's empty.

445
00:18:40,336 --> 00:18:42,077
Well, I didn't take
anything out of it.

446
00:18:42,164 --> 00:18:42,991
Where was the guy
that was driving?

447
00:18:43,078 --> 00:18:44,558
I don't know.

448
00:18:44,645 --> 00:18:45,080
He walked away about
20 minutes ago.

449
00:18:45,167 --> 00:18:46,473
And?

450
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,779
He took a big duffel bag
out of the trunk.

451
00:18:48,866 --> 00:18:51,782
It looked heavy.

452
00:18:51,869 --> 00:18:53,567
That's our bomb.

453
00:19:00,356 --> 00:19:02,116
All right, folks,
NYPD has got a carjacking

454
00:19:02,184 --> 00:19:05,013
a block away from the location
of Nathan's abandoned vehicle.

455
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,797
And the suspect fits
the description.

456
00:19:06,884 --> 00:19:08,321
Means he's feeling the heat.

457
00:19:08,408 --> 00:19:09,931
Ditched the car,
grabbed another,

458
00:19:10,018 --> 00:19:12,368
and he and the bomb are still
in the proverbial wind.

459
00:19:12,455 --> 00:19:14,892
So somebody please,
find me some eyes.

460
00:19:14,979 --> 00:19:16,459
- Got something.
- Yeah?

461
00:19:16,546 --> 00:19:17,958
Video from the parking lot
security camera

462
00:19:17,982 --> 00:19:18,548
that caught the carjacking.

463
00:19:18,635 --> 00:19:20,463
OK.

464
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:22,944
Here we go. Here we go.
It's good angle.

465
00:19:25,773 --> 00:19:28,428
Uh-huh, the bomb's got
to be in that duffel.

466
00:19:35,565 --> 00:19:37,045
Does that car
he just took have GPS?

467
00:19:37,132 --> 00:19:38,916
No, it's too old.

468
00:19:39,003 --> 00:19:40,459
It's got to be good enough
for facial rec, right?

469
00:19:40,483 --> 00:19:41,876
- Checking now.
- Come on.

470
00:19:41,963 --> 00:19:44,008
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

471
00:19:46,794 --> 00:19:47,969
Yes, got a hit.

472
00:19:48,056 --> 00:19:49,362
All right, eyes up, people.

473
00:19:49,449 --> 00:19:51,233
Suspect's name is Nathan Baker,

474
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,061
34 year old
from Portland, Oregon.

475
00:19:53,148 --> 00:19:54,647
Been in and out of
psychiatric institutions

476
00:19:54,671 --> 00:19:56,673
most of his adult life.

477
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,675
And currently wanted
for torching the home

478
00:19:58,762 --> 00:20:00,503
of Lawrence Howard,
Oregon State Chairman

479
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:02,636
of the Republican
National Committee.

480
00:20:02,723 --> 00:20:04,812
So he's stepping up his game,
escalating.

481
00:20:04,899 --> 00:20:06,205
Do we have any other video,

482
00:20:06,292 --> 00:20:07,692
know which direction
he's traveling?

483
00:20:07,728 --> 00:20:09,184
Just got a hit on
a traffic cam position

484
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,446
near the Long Island Expressway.

485
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:13,777
Shows a Black Nissan
heading east.

486
00:20:13,864 --> 00:20:15,997
OK, East on the LIE
means the original target

487
00:20:16,084 --> 00:20:17,607
is still in play.

488
00:20:17,694 --> 00:20:18,802
All right, let's alert
the agents we already have

489
00:20:18,826 --> 00:20:19,890
covering the building,
get the rest of the team

490
00:20:19,914 --> 00:20:21,742
over there ASAP.

491
00:20:21,829 --> 00:20:23,222
OK.

492
00:20:23,309 --> 00:20:27,617
But are we evacuating
the building?

493
00:20:27,704 --> 00:20:28,836
To hell with politics.

494
00:20:28,923 --> 00:20:30,316
He's heading east.

495
00:20:30,403 --> 00:20:32,361
His dead buddy told him
about the conference.

496
00:20:35,059 --> 00:20:36,409
Let's do it.

497
00:20:36,496 --> 00:20:38,498
OK.

498
00:20:38,585 --> 00:20:39,953
Jubal, we have
boots on the ground.

499
00:20:39,977 --> 00:20:41,501
Initiating the search.

500
00:20:46,897 --> 00:20:48,725
Hey, that's our car, right?

501
00:20:48,812 --> 00:20:50,379
Yep.

502
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,908
- It's clear.
- Clear over here.

503
00:21:00,302 --> 00:21:01,323
Engine's still warm, which means

504
00:21:01,347 --> 00:21:02,043
Nathan could be in the area.

505
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:04,045
OK, cover me.

506
00:21:14,316 --> 00:21:16,187
- It's empty.
- All right.

507
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,711
Hey, guys, no bomb here,
which means

508
00:21:17,798 --> 00:21:19,558
he's either planted it
or he's in the process.

509
00:21:19,582 --> 00:21:22,542
Either way, we need to
evacuate the building ASAP.

510
00:21:22,629 --> 00:21:25,240
- Please, please.
- Thank you all for coming.

511
00:21:25,327 --> 00:21:27,373
Ladies and gentlemen,

512
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:29,331
Special Agent Stuart Scola
with the FBI.

513
00:21:29,418 --> 00:21:30,898
There's nothing to panic about.

514
00:21:30,985 --> 00:21:33,727
But we need everyone
to proceed to the exits

515
00:21:33,814 --> 00:21:35,729
in an orderly fashion.

516
00:21:35,816 --> 00:21:37,905
- Leave the building.
- Come on, you heard him.

517
00:21:37,992 --> 00:21:39,361
This is not a request.
It's not up for debate.

518
00:21:39,385 --> 00:21:40,516
Let's go.

519
00:21:40,603 --> 00:21:41,798
Leave your personal
belongings behind

520
00:21:41,822 --> 00:21:42,910
and head towards the exits.

521
00:21:42,997 --> 00:21:45,869
- Up you go.
- Let's go.

522
00:21:45,956 --> 00:21:47,828
OK. Jubal, we just sent you
the access codes.

523
00:21:47,915 --> 00:21:49,458
We need you guys
to tap into the camera feed

524
00:21:49,482 --> 00:21:50,744
here at the conference center.

525
00:21:50,831 --> 00:21:52,659
Elise, you got the feed?

526
00:21:52,746 --> 00:21:54,530
Yeah, there are
12 cameras in total.

527
00:21:54,617 --> 00:21:56,010
Looks like they
cover the entrance,

528
00:21:56,097 --> 00:21:57,977
- exits, and stairwells.
- OK, good, good, good.

529
00:21:58,012 --> 00:21:59,709
We need you to scrub
the last 15 minutes.

530
00:21:59,796 --> 00:22:01,078
Nathan could still be
wearing a gray hoodie

531
00:22:01,102 --> 00:22:05,019
and hopefully carrying
a black duffel bag.

532
00:22:05,106 --> 00:22:08,196
Yeah, we're on it.

533
00:22:08,283 --> 00:22:09,719
- Wait. Stop.
- Right there.

534
00:22:09,806 --> 00:22:11,480
- Yeah, yeah, there he is.
- When was this?

535
00:22:11,504 --> 00:22:13,419
Time stamp says 15 minutes ago.

536
00:22:13,506 --> 00:22:15,899
OK, OA, he entered
stairwell three 15 minutes ago

537
00:22:15,986 --> 00:22:17,510
and headed downstairs.

538
00:22:17,597 --> 00:22:18,791
It appears he has
the bomb with him.

539
00:22:18,815 --> 00:22:20,208
Where is stairwell number three?

540
00:22:20,295 --> 00:22:21,818
- West end of the building.
- OK.

541
00:22:21,905 --> 00:22:25,256
OK, Jubal, has Nathan left
that stairwell yet?

542
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:26,843
I don't think we
have a basement feed.

543
00:22:26,867 --> 00:22:28,307
- Do we have a basement feed?
- Nope.

544
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,610
OK, fast-forward.

545
00:22:30,697 --> 00:22:32,699
Keep going.

546
00:22:32,786 --> 00:22:35,179
Keep going.

547
00:22:35,266 --> 00:22:39,706
Yeah, he leaves
five minutes later.

548
00:22:39,793 --> 00:22:42,186
And he does not have
the duffel bag on him,

549
00:22:42,273 --> 00:22:44,711
which means the bomb
is in place.

550
00:23:07,037 --> 00:23:10,911
Tiff?

551
00:23:10,998 --> 00:23:14,915
Jubal, we have eyes on
the black duffel bag.

552
00:23:15,002 --> 00:23:18,005
- Come on.
- Come on.

553
00:23:36,502 --> 00:23:38,417
How are we looking?

554
00:23:38,504 --> 00:23:42,246
Looks pretty straightforward.

555
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:43,613
Should be able
to render it safe.

556
00:23:43,639 --> 00:23:44,814
Thank God.

557
00:23:44,901 --> 00:23:46,816
That timer is ticking down
real fast.

558
00:23:46,903 --> 00:23:48,949
Welcome to my world.

559
00:23:49,036 --> 00:23:50,951
Scola, be advised
we are in the process

560
00:23:51,038 --> 00:23:53,693
of disarming the bomb.

561
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:55,782
Kelly, Elise,
having any luck finding Nathan?

562
00:23:55,869 --> 00:23:57,697
- Well, nothing so far.
- Yeah, me neither.

563
00:24:01,918 --> 00:24:03,659
Scola, you got eyes
on the suspect?

564
00:24:03,746 --> 00:24:04,984
- Negative.
- We're doing our best,

565
00:24:05,008 --> 00:24:07,750
but there's a lot of movement
right now.

566
00:24:07,837 --> 00:24:09,665
Look, he could be
taking advantage of this

567
00:24:09,752 --> 00:24:12,320
and blending in
with the evacuees.

568
00:24:20,937 --> 00:24:22,461
Hey, what's going on?

569
00:24:22,548 --> 00:24:23,984
Hey, did you get the cake?

570
00:24:24,071 --> 00:24:25,855
Not yet.

571
00:24:25,942 --> 00:24:27,727
I... I'll handle it.

572
00:24:27,814 --> 00:24:29,694
OK, if you need me
to get it, just let me know

573
00:24:29,729 --> 00:24:31,010
- and I'll go do it.
- I'll handle it.

574
00:24:31,034 --> 00:24:32,296
I promise.
But I got to go.

575
00:24:32,383 --> 00:24:34,734
I'll see you tonight?

576
00:24:34,821 --> 00:24:37,650
Hey, Jubal, you OK?

577
00:24:37,737 --> 00:24:40,653
Yeah, yeah, no,
that was... it was nothing.

578
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:42,437
I need you to head over
to North port.

579
00:24:42,524 --> 00:24:43,394
I need you to oversee this.

580
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:45,048
Yeah, of course, OK.

581
00:24:50,271 --> 00:24:52,142
Think I've got it.

582
00:24:53,579 --> 00:24:55,058
Wait, no.

583
00:24:55,145 --> 00:24:56,407
No what?

584
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:57,670
Is there a problem?

585
00:24:57,757 --> 00:24:59,759
There is now.

586
00:24:59,846 --> 00:25:01,693
Looks like the guy who built
this anticipated someone

587
00:25:01,717 --> 00:25:05,808
trying to disarm it, added
some collapsing circuits.

588
00:25:05,895 --> 00:25:07,855
Meaning there's two different
ignition components.

589
00:25:07,941 --> 00:25:08,855
OK, and that's bad?

590
00:25:08,942 --> 00:25:10,073
You can't disarm both?

591
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,466
I can.

592
00:25:11,553 --> 00:25:12,953
But not before that
timer hits zero.

593
00:25:13,033 --> 00:25:14,513
- Come on, guys.
- Let's go.

594
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,253
Evacuate.

595
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:18,536
OK, so we move it to a place
with less damage potential.

596
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,257
I wouldn't chance it.

597
00:25:20,344 --> 00:25:21,998
If a guy went through
that much effort,

598
00:25:22,085 --> 00:25:23,628
it's a good chance he put
a motion sensor in there,

599
00:25:23,652 --> 00:25:25,021
meaning once that timer
is initiated,

600
00:25:25,045 --> 00:25:27,395
any movement will cause
that thing to go off.

601
00:25:31,747 --> 00:25:33,508
Hey, Basur, are you
certain that that is part

602
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:36,099
of the bomb's construction?

603
00:25:36,186 --> 00:25:38,319
No, but there's not
enough time to confirm

604
00:25:38,406 --> 00:25:39,973
that it does or doesn't.

605
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:41,864
Look, I'm just going to
shoot this to you straight.

606
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:45,674
We need to get clear of
this area, and I mean now.

607
00:25:51,419 --> 00:25:53,639
Scola, please tell me
the evacuation is complete.

608
00:25:53,726 --> 00:25:55,684
I think this bomb
is going to blow.

609
00:25:55,771 --> 00:25:56,598
Negative, there
are still at least

610
00:25:56,685 --> 00:25:59,122
300 people on the third floor.

611
00:26:24,844 --> 00:26:26,280
Why are you two still in there?

612
00:26:26,367 --> 00:26:28,021
Clear the area now.

613
00:26:28,108 --> 00:26:29,718
Isobel, there is
no chance we can

614
00:26:29,805 --> 00:26:30,869
get everyone clear
of the blast radius

615
00:26:30,893 --> 00:26:32,460
before this thing goes off.

616
00:26:32,547 --> 00:26:34,462
OA, this is about
preservation of life now,

617
00:26:34,549 --> 00:26:36,420
including your own.

618
00:26:36,507 --> 00:26:37,813
Look, you heard her.

619
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,946
We got to get out of here.

620
00:26:40,033 --> 00:26:41,861
OK.

621
00:26:44,037 --> 00:26:45,734
All the way down, this way.

622
00:26:45,821 --> 00:26:47,059
How many people are
left in the building?

623
00:26:47,083 --> 00:26:48,432
Too many.

624
00:26:48,519 --> 00:26:49,888
There's a wedding party
on the second floor.

625
00:26:49,912 --> 00:26:50,933
Isobel, please be
advised the evacuation

626
00:26:50,957 --> 00:26:51,977
is not going to be complete.

627
00:26:52,001 --> 00:26:53,176
I am aware.

628
00:26:53,263 --> 00:26:54,700
But we are out of options.

629
00:26:54,787 --> 00:26:56,484
Get the hell out of there now.

630
00:26:56,571 --> 00:26:58,268
That is an order.

631
00:27:01,663 --> 00:27:03,099
Yes, ma'am.

632
00:27:03,186 --> 00:27:05,928
Let's go.

633
00:27:06,015 --> 00:27:08,278
Tiff, pull my SUV up
to the nearest exit.

634
00:27:08,365 --> 00:27:09,995
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
what are you doing?

635
00:27:10,019 --> 00:27:11,934
Look, you cannot
move that thing.

636
00:27:12,021 --> 00:27:14,173
- What if it has a motion sensor?
- The bomb tech said there...

637
00:27:14,197 --> 00:27:15,851
Bomb tech said that
there is a chance.

638
00:27:15,938 --> 00:27:19,420
And if there's a chance,
I got to take it, OK?

639
00:27:19,507 --> 00:27:22,292
Please.

640
00:27:22,379 --> 00:27:24,164
Yeah.

641
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:39,788
This way towards the exit,
quickly.

642
00:27:56,936 --> 00:27:59,460
Come on, keep it moving,
quickly and calmly.

643
00:27:59,547 --> 00:28:00,591
There's a bomb?

644
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:01,723
Ma'am, everything's OK.

645
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:02,898
We have it under control.

646
00:28:02,985 --> 00:28:04,378
Please move towards the exit.

647
00:28:32,449 --> 00:28:33,668
Move.

648
00:28:33,755 --> 00:28:35,670
Move.

649
00:28:35,757 --> 00:28:37,628
All right, what are we doing?

650
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:40,022
I am taking this to a place
with less damage potential.

651
00:28:40,109 --> 00:28:41,545
OK.

652
00:28:41,632 --> 00:28:43,219
- You are staying here to help.
- Please.

653
00:28:43,243 --> 00:28:45,158
OA, no, I'm coming with you.

654
00:28:45,245 --> 00:28:46,565
Tiff, I'm the senior agent here.

655
00:28:46,594 --> 00:28:47,377
We do not have time
to discuss this.

656
00:28:47,464 --> 00:28:49,336
I'm sorry.

657
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:11,880
OA, drop that thing
on the side of the road

658
00:29:11,967 --> 00:29:13,664
and get the hell out of there.

659
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:16,450
I'm not far enough away
from the building, Isobel.

660
00:29:16,537 --> 00:29:17,973
Get out of there.

661
00:29:21,847 --> 00:29:24,632
Get out of there!
That is an order!

662
00:29:58,840 --> 00:29:59,972
OA?

663
00:30:00,059 --> 00:30:02,061
OA, answer me.

664
00:30:05,716 --> 00:30:07,588
OA, do you copy?

665
00:30:12,767 --> 00:30:14,551
Come on, OA, answer me.

666
00:30:19,382 --> 00:30:20,731
I'm good.

667
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,168
I'm OK.

668
00:30:24,474 --> 00:30:26,520
We still need to
find Nathan, though.

669
00:30:26,607 --> 00:30:28,870
- You guys start searching.
- I'm going to go pick up OA.

670
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:34,920
What's up?

671
00:30:35,007 --> 00:30:36,747
That's Nathan.

672
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,924
He ditched the black hoodie.

673
00:30:39,011 --> 00:30:40,708
That's him.

674
00:30:43,363 --> 00:30:45,104
We're in foot pursuit
of the suspect,

675
00:30:45,191 --> 00:30:47,323
heading south away
from the building.

676
00:30:52,502 --> 00:30:53,895
He burned us.

677
00:31:09,911 --> 00:31:11,478
FBI, freeze!

678
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:16,178
We've got shots fired.

679
00:31:16,265 --> 00:31:18,006
We need an immediate
containment.

680
00:31:22,358 --> 00:31:24,665
Suspect is a white male wearing
a green shirt and jeans.

681
00:31:27,276 --> 00:31:29,975
We're on scene.

682
00:31:30,062 --> 00:31:33,065
Nathan, drop the weapon!

683
00:31:34,936 --> 00:31:38,244
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

684
00:31:38,331 --> 00:31:40,463
- Drop the gun, Nathan.
- Listen to him, Nathan!

685
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:42,378
- There's nowhere to go.
- Whoa.

686
00:31:45,033 --> 00:31:46,339
Back off.

687
00:31:46,426 --> 00:31:48,645
Come any closer,
and I kill the kid.

688
00:31:53,346 --> 00:31:55,783
Get away.
I mean it.

689
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:57,176
It's over, Nathan.

690
00:31:57,263 --> 00:31:59,265
He dies unless you walk away.

691
00:32:02,007 --> 00:32:03,965
- Do it.
- Hey, listen, listen.

692
00:32:04,052 --> 00:32:06,248
- You don't need to hurt the boy.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, please.

693
00:32:06,272 --> 00:32:07,186
- Please, please don't do this.
- I mean it!

694
00:32:07,273 --> 00:32:08,709
All of you, back off!

695
00:32:25,291 --> 00:32:26,161
- Hey. What do you got?
- Hey.

696
00:32:26,248 --> 00:32:29,469
Hostage is white,
brown hair, 15 years old.

697
00:32:29,556 --> 00:32:30,794
Car was parked to the
right of that vehicle.

698
00:32:30,818 --> 00:32:31,906
They escaped this way.

699
00:32:31,993 --> 00:32:32,515
All right, where's the father?

700
00:32:32,602 --> 00:32:33,821
Right here.

701
00:32:33,908 --> 00:32:35,344
- Sir?
- Yes?

702
00:32:35,431 --> 00:32:36,041
- Hey, Agent Valentine...
- Did you find him?

703
00:32:36,128 --> 00:32:37,651
Did you find Charlie?

704
00:32:37,738 --> 00:32:39,324
Not yet, but we have agents
surrounding the area.

705
00:32:39,348 --> 00:32:40,891
And we are confident they
have not left the vicinity.

706
00:32:40,915 --> 00:32:42,308
- OK.
- OK, good.

707
00:32:42,395 --> 00:32:43,918
So hopefully...

708
00:32:44,005 --> 00:32:45,678
I should have never brought him
to that conference.

709
00:32:45,702 --> 00:32:47,622
I just thought it would
be educational for him...

710
00:32:47,661 --> 00:32:49,639
- This is not your fault.
- I'm sure you were just trying

711
00:32:49,663 --> 00:32:51,360
to spend time with your son.

712
00:32:54,407 --> 00:32:56,583
I can't imagine
what you're going through.

713
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:58,691
But I need you to stay positive
and let us do our thing.

714
00:32:58,715 --> 00:33:00,215
We're going to do everything
we can to find Charlie

715
00:33:00,239 --> 00:33:01,599
and make sure nobody
hurts him, OK?

716
00:33:01,675 --> 00:33:02,719
Thank you.

717
00:33:02,806 --> 00:33:04,286
All right, stay put.

718
00:33:04,373 --> 00:33:05,611
Stay with my agent
in case we need you.

719
00:33:05,635 --> 00:33:08,595
OK.

720
00:33:08,682 --> 00:33:10,858
Please leave a message
after the tone.

721
00:33:17,299 --> 00:33:18,605
Hey, Sam, Tyler just called me.

722
00:33:18,692 --> 00:33:20,389
Everything OK?

723
00:33:20,476 --> 00:33:22,150
Yeah, he's upset
because a couple of kids

724
00:33:22,174 --> 00:33:24,915
decided to go to the Mets game
instead of his birthday party.

725
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:27,483
Oh, OK.

726
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:29,410
OK, well, you can minimize it
if you want to.

727
00:33:29,485 --> 00:33:31,005
- No, I'm not.
- I'm not minimizing it.

728
00:33:31,052 --> 00:33:32,358
What are we going to do?

729
00:33:32,445 --> 00:33:33,857
The kids, they want to
go to the Mets game.

730
00:33:33,881 --> 00:33:37,667
He's having a really
hard time with it, Jubal.

731
00:33:37,754 --> 00:33:39,843
Yeah, I know Tyler
is having a tough time.

732
00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:41,932
You keep telling me.

733
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,519
- Look, I got to go.
- I'm in the middle of something.

734
00:33:43,543 --> 00:33:44,718
I'll call you later.

735
00:33:47,329 --> 00:33:48,504
- Hey, Isobel.
- What's up?

736
00:33:48,591 --> 00:33:50,767
Hey, Suffolk County PD
found the suspect's car

737
00:33:50,854 --> 00:33:52,160
about a half a mile away.

738
00:33:52,247 --> 00:33:54,423
- OK, that's good news.
- Where?

739
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:56,556
Oh, that's not far.
I'm on the way.

740
00:34:19,318 --> 00:34:21,537
- We have eyes on the suspect?
- Not exactly.

741
00:34:21,624 --> 00:34:23,713
But we did find his vehicle
abandoned one block away.

742
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,193
Containment is pretty tight.

743
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,562
So the only place
he could possibly be

744
00:34:26,586 --> 00:34:28,414
is in that building.

745
00:34:28,501 --> 00:34:30,764
Right.

746
00:34:30,851 --> 00:34:32,331
Get down!
Get down!

747
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,554
OA, call it in.

748
00:34:38,641 --> 00:34:39,773
We have shots fired.

749
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:41,209
Suspect is held up
at the building

750
00:34:41,296 --> 00:34:43,516
at the corner of Waterford Way
and Mansfield.

751
00:34:43,603 --> 00:34:45,909
- Shots fired.
- Alpha team get in position.

752
00:34:47,563 --> 00:34:51,219
Nathan, this is
Agent Jubal Valentine, FBI.

753
00:34:51,306 --> 00:34:53,961
I'm here to help you.

754
00:34:54,048 --> 00:34:57,399
I want a car with bulletproof
glass in the next 15 minutes

755
00:34:57,486 --> 00:34:59,053
or the boy dies.

756
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:00,446
We don't have a shot.

757
00:35:00,533 --> 00:35:03,536
OK, I think I can
make that happen.

758
00:35:03,623 --> 00:35:06,539
But first things first, you
need to release the hostage.

759
00:35:06,626 --> 00:35:09,368
His name is Charlie.
He's 15 years old.

760
00:35:09,455 --> 00:35:11,805
And he has nothing to do
with any of this.

761
00:35:11,892 --> 00:35:14,305
- Once you do that, we can talk...
- I'm not letting anyone go.

762
00:35:14,329 --> 00:35:17,376
Just get me a car
or the boy dies.

763
00:35:19,595 --> 00:35:20,509
You sure this
building is contained?

764
00:35:20,596 --> 00:35:22,207
Yes, positive.

765
00:35:22,294 --> 00:35:22,946
All right, let's make sure
the snipers are in position,

766
00:35:23,033 --> 00:35:25,035
- yeah?
- OK.

767
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:26,602
Hey, Jubal.

768
00:35:26,689 --> 00:35:28,430
Yeah?

769
00:35:28,517 --> 00:35:30,408
There's a delivery door
in the back of the building.

770
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:31,825
- Uh-huh.
- If you distract him,

771
00:35:31,912 --> 00:35:34,697
we can make entry there.

772
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:37,831
Let's do it.

773
00:35:56,023 --> 00:35:57,198
Jubal, we're in position.

774
00:35:57,285 --> 00:35:59,592
All right, do your thing.

775
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:01,898
Just keep him engaged.

776
00:36:23,529 --> 00:36:27,054
Nathan, it's me,
Agent Valentine.

777
00:36:27,141 --> 00:36:30,405
I'm unarmed.
I got no weapon here.

778
00:36:30,492 --> 00:36:34,844
I just want to talk this out,
me and you, OK?

779
00:36:34,931 --> 00:36:37,195
Now look, I'm going to need you
to release the kid.

780
00:36:37,282 --> 00:36:39,849
It's the only way I'm going
to be able to get you a car.

781
00:36:39,936 --> 00:36:42,504
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, easy, easy.

782
00:36:44,941 --> 00:36:46,726
I want to see the car.

783
00:36:46,813 --> 00:36:48,653
I'm not releasing him until...
Until it's here,

784
00:36:48,728 --> 00:36:50,208
until I can see it
with my own eyes.

785
00:36:50,295 --> 00:36:52,558
OK, I can work with that.

786
00:36:52,645 --> 00:36:54,690
That's fine.
We're working on it.

787
00:36:54,777 --> 00:36:57,476
You should have an SUV
with bulletproof glass

788
00:36:57,563 --> 00:36:59,173
here in about...
About 20 minutes or so.

789
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,566
I need it faster.

790
00:37:00,653 --> 00:37:02,481
Hey, man,
I'm doing the best I can.

791
00:37:02,568 --> 00:37:04,198
It's not easy to find
a bulletproof glass...

792
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:05,048
I see a lot of cars back there.

793
00:37:05,135 --> 00:37:06,156
Just give me one of those.

794
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:07,877
Pull it around back and...

795
00:37:07,964 --> 00:37:09,792
OK, OK, yeah, that's fine.

796
00:37:09,879 --> 00:37:11,359
That's fine.

797
00:37:11,446 --> 00:37:12,510
Now, why don't you just
let Charlie go, all right?

798
00:37:12,534 --> 00:37:13,535
And we can...

799
00:37:13,622 --> 00:37:15,581
I just told you
I want a car now!

800
00:37:15,668 --> 00:37:17,211
So stop playing around
and make it happen,

801
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:18,864
or I'm going to shoot this kid
in the head, I swear to God.

802
00:37:18,888 --> 00:37:19,888
Hey, hey, stop, stop.

803
00:37:19,933 --> 00:37:21,413
Hey, that is a bad idea.

804
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,304
You do that, everybody loses.
Please, let me help you.

805
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:24,981
Let me get you into a car or...

806
00:37:25,068 --> 00:37:26,896
You... you know what?

807
00:37:26,983 --> 00:37:28,202
Better yet, let me drive you.

808
00:37:28,289 --> 00:37:29,353
I'll take you wherever
you want to go.

809
00:37:29,377 --> 00:37:30,441
You want to go to the airport?

810
00:37:30,465 --> 00:37:31,825
You want to go to
the bus terminal?

811
00:37:31,901 --> 00:37:33,947
- You name it.
- No, I don't want you.

812
00:37:34,034 --> 00:37:35,034
I want a car.

813
00:37:35,078 --> 00:37:35,992
Stop talking.

814
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:37,603
Stop negotiating.

815
00:37:44,653 --> 00:37:46,699
- Hey, hey.
- Oh, Nathan.

816
00:37:46,786 --> 00:37:48,024
You're not thinking
this through.

817
00:37:48,048 --> 00:37:49,223
Listen to me.

818
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:50,461
If I'm in the car,
nobody's going

819
00:37:50,485 --> 00:37:53,488
to do anything stupid, right?

820
00:37:53,575 --> 00:37:54,837
Right?

821
00:37:54,924 --> 00:37:55,924
It's a smart id...

822
00:37:57,797 --> 00:38:00,495
- Come on. I got you.
- You're okay. This way.

823
00:38:00,582 --> 00:38:01,820
- You're okay.
- You're all right.

824
00:38:01,844 --> 00:38:03,324
Let's go over here.

825
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:13,073
Right this way.

826
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,596
Thank you so much.

827
00:38:14,683 --> 00:38:15,834
I don't even know
where to begin.

828
00:38:15,858 --> 00:38:17,575
- I'm just glad your son is OK.
- Here he is.

829
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:19,862
- Oh, Charlie.
- Dad.

830
00:38:21,342 --> 00:38:24,650
Oh, Charlie. Oh, God.

831
00:38:24,737 --> 00:38:26,521
I'm so sorry.

832
00:38:26,608 --> 00:38:28,044
You okay?

833
00:38:29,785 --> 00:38:32,310
OK.

834
00:38:52,721 --> 00:38:54,854
Hello?

835
00:38:54,941 --> 00:38:56,159
Hey.

836
00:39:01,121 --> 00:39:02,165
I'm sorry, Sam.

837
00:39:02,252 --> 00:39:05,995
I... I got swept up in a case.

838
00:39:06,082 --> 00:39:08,389
A kid was taken hostage.

839
00:39:14,134 --> 00:39:15,265
How was the party?

840
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:17,267
It was fine.

841
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:19,835
How many kids showed up?

842
00:39:19,922 --> 00:39:21,097
Four.

843
00:39:21,184 --> 00:39:23,839
But they had fun.

844
00:39:23,926 --> 00:39:25,319
I think they did, anyway.

845
00:39:25,406 --> 00:39:28,278
Yeah, no, I'm sure they...

846
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:30,890
Well, thanks for...

847
00:39:30,977 --> 00:39:35,198
not making me feel any worse
than I already feel.

848
00:39:40,073 --> 00:39:41,466
Ty upstairs?

849
00:39:41,553 --> 00:39:43,076
- Yeah.
- Mind if I say good night?

850
00:39:43,163 --> 00:39:44,338
Of course.

851
00:40:32,342 --> 00:40:34,388
I love you, buddy.
