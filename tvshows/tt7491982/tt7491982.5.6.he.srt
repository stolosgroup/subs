- John Bryant, 43.

He works for a private
equity firm in London.

117
00:04:34,249 --> 00:04:36,879
So he lives in London,
and the wife lives in New York?

118
00:04:36,903 --> 00:04:39,490
That is because they're divorced,
but on good terms.

119
00:04:39,514 --> 00:04:41,622
He seems happily remarried
to a woman named Andrea.

120
00:04:41,646 --> 00:04:43,189
Yeah, he's actually
on his way to New York.

121
00:04:43,213 --> 00:04:44,757
He should be here
in about seven hours or so.

Luke's abduction

123
00:04:46,521 --> 00:04:48,761
is not connected to the father.
What do we know about Liza?

00:04:48,784 --> 00:04:51,952
Does she have any skeletons
in the closet, any enemies?
