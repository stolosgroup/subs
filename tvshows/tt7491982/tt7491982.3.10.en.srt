I don't like this idea.
I mean, we're doing fine.

3

The bills--
the bills are getting paid.

4
00:00:18,284 --> 00:00:20,153
- For now. For now.

5
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,189
I'm a 68-year-old man
working toward a retirement

6
00:00:23,256 --> 00:00:24,657
that will not pay the bills.

7
00:00:24,724 --> 00:00:26,126
That's why we're doing this.

8
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:27,160
- I don't like this idea.

9
00:00:27,227 --> 00:00:29,229

We've talked about this.

10
00:00:29,295 --> 00:00:31,030
It's gonna be fine, all right?
- Okay.

00:00:31,097 --> 00:00:33,133
Okay.
- Come here.

12
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:34,701
- All right. Be careful.
- All right.

Sergeant Clark?

38

I used to work with him

- Douglas Burke.
- Nina Lewis.

45
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:12,131
You're dressed pretty sharp
for a Fed.

46
00:02:12,198 --> 00:02:14,300
Thought you all wore
the standard-issue G-man suit.

47
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:16,236
- Well, after five years
of wearing a uniform,

48
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:17,303
you gotta take the opportunity

49

Yeah, our money's no good here.

53

- He's right.

54
00:02:26,846 --> 00:02:27,847

55
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,318

- Yeah.

58

- So what was that about?
- What?

59
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:46,900
- Paying for the coffee.

60
00:02:46,966 --> 00:02:48,835
- It's bureau policy.
We can't accept--

61
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:51,204
- I know bureau policy,
but for goodness' sakes,

62
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:52,272
it was just a cup of coffee.

63
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:53,806
The guy was trying
to be friendly.

64
00:02:53,873 --> 00:02:55,708
You embarrassed him.
Made him feel like an idiot.

65
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:57,744
- Well, that wasn't
my intention.

66
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,812
- Well, that was the result.

67
00:03:17,897 --> 00:03:19,899
- What the hell?

68
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:22,735
- Okay, everyone.

69
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:25,305
This is a tough one.

70
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:27,907
You all know Howard Kirkland.

71
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:29,442
He worked security at 26 Fed

72
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:31,444
longer than any of us
have been agents.

73
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:32,979
He was also working
a second job

74
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,881
at a check cashing center
in Brooklyn.

75
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:37,784
- And this morning,
gunmen stormed that center,

76
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:40,787
and Howard was killed
defending the people inside.

77
00:03:40,853 --> 00:03:42,221
- I just talked to him
last night.

78
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:43,756
He said that he was putting
his retirement off

79
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:44,857
for another year.

80
00:03:44,924 --> 00:03:46,893
His wife had a stroke
last month.

81
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,328
Anybody spoken to her?

82
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:49,996
- NYPD has notified her.

83
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,464
She had just dropped him off.

84
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:53,333
- Okay, we're taking the case,
though, right?

85
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:54,867
- Damn right we are.

86
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:56,002
What do we know so far?

87
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,837
- MO matches
two other robberies

88
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,372
at check cashing stores
in Queens

89
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,473
over the past three weeks.

90
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,975
NYPD's Central Robbery Division

91
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:03,242
has been investigating, but--

92
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:04,544
- Right, but these guys
are pros.

93
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:06,946
They cover their tracks well.

94
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:09,382
- This is surveillance footage
from the first two robberies.

95
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:11,551
Our robbers
wear these animal masks

96
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:14,821
to conceal their identities--
a rat and a dog.

97
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:16,489
- The Rat controls the hostages

98
00:04:16,556 --> 00:04:17,290
while the Dog makes quick work

99
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:18,992
of shooting out
security cameras.

100
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:21,828
- They're in and out in less
than four minutes every time.

101
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:23,296
- Which one shot Howard?

102
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:25,498
- According to witnesses,
the Rat.

103
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:27,000
- Yeah, and this is the
first time they've killed, too,

104
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:28,501
which means they're escalating.

105
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:30,503
They'll shoot and kill again.

106
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,905
- Do we have any information
to ID these guys?

107
00:04:32,972 --> 00:04:34,774
- They've been careful,
managed to avoid

108
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:37,343
getting caught on street cams
so far.

109
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:38,544
The only thing
I've been able to find

110
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:39,912
is a tattoo.

111
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:41,347
Our robber in the dog mask

112
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:42,782
has a crescent moon
on his wrist,

113
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:45,385
but it's not popping
in the criminal database.

114
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:46,853
- Yeah. Yeah, that's something.

115
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:48,921
Let's reach out
to local tattoo artists.

116
00:04:48,988 --> 00:04:50,523
Maybe someone'll
recognize something.

117
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:51,891
Everyone else,
let's pull footage

118
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:52,925
from the area
around the robbery.

119
00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:55,061
See if we can catch these guys
coming or going.

120
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,330
- All right, you guys
head over to the scene.

121
00:04:57,397 --> 00:04:58,531
Follow up with witnesses.

122
00:04:58,598 --> 00:05:00,033
You guys collect any kind

123
00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:01,934
of information
NYPD already has.

124
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:04,003
I want these guys
in custody fast.

125
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:12,445
- We'll take
witness interviews.

126
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:14,047
Why don't you guys talk
to the handling detectives,

127
00:05:14,113 --> 00:05:15,481
see if there's anything new
to run on?

128
00:05:15,548 --> 00:05:16,649
- We're on it.

129
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:21,421
- Hey, Tiff.
- Hey.

130
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,022
- What are you doing here?
- What's up?

131
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:24,023
- They got you
working this one?

132
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:26,826
- Yep.

133
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:29,095
Um, the victim's
actually one of ours.

134
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,431
He worked at 26 Fed.
- Yeah, we heard.

135
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:33,466
I'm sorry.
Frank Dixon.

136
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:35,334
This is my partner,
Roger Palmer.

137
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:37,103
Palmer, this is Tiffany Wallace
and, uh...

138
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,571
- Stuart Scola.

139
00:05:38,638 --> 00:05:40,373
You two used to work together?

140
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,974
- Dixon was my
training officer.

141
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,843
- Yeah, you got
a good one here, Stuart.

142
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:46,913
- Yeah, we're lucky
to have her.

143
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:49,015
- So, um, catch us up.
What do we need to know?

144
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:50,850
- Well, for starters,
these guys are good.

145
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:52,585
They move fast,
don't leave a lot behind.

146
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:54,587
Made off with 40 grand
this time.

147
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:56,456
- Any actionable leads?
- No.

148
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:58,124
We've interviewed
almost 70 witnesses

149
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,860
since the first robbery;
nothing we can run on.

150
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:02,929
Look, I get that
you lost a colleague today,

151
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:04,864
but we've been working
around the clock on this.

152
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:07,400
Not sure it makes sense for you
to just take it from us.

153
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:10,603
- Well, we got resources
that you don't,

154
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:13,473
and like Tiff said,
he was one of ours.

155
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,007
- Yeah, well,

156
00:06:15,074 --> 00:06:16,876
we're pretty invested
in this case, that's all,

157
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:19,479
so maybe we can
work this together, huh?

158
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:20,680
- Of course.

159
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:22,014
- Yeah, we'll see.

160
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:23,149

468

00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,268
the cops are investigating
a couple weeks ago?

478
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:05,270
- We know you already spoke
to the police about this.

479
00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:07,339
- Yeah, and like I told them,

480
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:08,707
I haven't sold
either of those masks

481
00:20:08,774 --> 00:20:10,909
before those stores got robbed.

482
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:13,779
- But you sold them since?

483
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:15,948
- Yeah.
- Okay.

484
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:18,550
To who?

485
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:21,653
- One of the cops.

486
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,589
Came back,
bought both the masks.

487
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:26,291
Needed to "put it in the file"
or something like that.

488
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:27,826
- When was this?

489
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:29,561
- Three days ago.
Maybe four.

490
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:30,829
- Do you remember his name?

491
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:32,698
- No.

492
00:20:32,764 --> 00:20:35,300
- Does this store have cameras?
- No.

493
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:38,270
We don't get a lot of people
stealing stuff here.

494
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:40,005
- Okay, what did this cop
look like?

495
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:42,608
- White guy.
Salt and pepper hair.

496
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:46,979
- How old was he?
- Maybe 40?

497
00:20:47,045 --> 00:20:49,715
Had these pretty blue eyes.

- Yeah. That's the guy.

501
00:21:02,694 --> 00:21:04,930
- Son of a bitch.

I knew I didn't like that guy,
Palmer.

- We don't know for sure yet.

504

- No wonder they wanted
to hold on to the case,

505
00:21:12,337 --> 00:21:14,806
didn't want us digging
into their investigation.

506
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:16,341

for sure.

Not yet.

508

every detail

509
00:21:18,977 --> 00:21:19,945
of the robberies in Queens.

510
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:22,014
Then a few days before
the robberies in Brooklyn,

511
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,783
he bought the same exact masks
they were using.

512
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:25,784
Look, he's our guy.

513

I'm not sure what this means
about Dixon, but--

514
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:28,754
- No.

515
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:31,423
Dixon doesn't have anything
to do with this.

516
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:34,026
Regardless of what Palmer
may or may not have done.

517
00:21:34,092 --> 00:21:34,960
- You don't know that, Tiff.

518
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:36,795
Why do you think
it's taken them so long

519
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:38,830
to solve this thing--
or not solve this thing?

520
00:21:38,897 --> 00:21:41,333
I mean, we got
to Maynard and Wilson in a day.

521
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,368
- These guys are working
on 30 cases at a time

with a tenth of the resources.

you're still a cop at heart.

Like, I get that.

But the facts
are the facts, Tiff,

526
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:55,781
so the sooner you get
on board here, the better.

527
00:21:57,449 --> 00:21:58,817
- What the hell does that mean?

528
00:21:58,884 --> 00:22:01,787
- I'm saying that I think
your relationship with Dixon

529
00:22:01,853 --> 00:22:03,922
is clouding your judgement.

Property clerk in Queens

said that there was no mask
ever logged into evidence.

534

that he went back

to the costume shop
in any of his reports.

after he became familiar
with the robbers' MO.

538

move on him

a couple of masks.

Look, Palmer's cell phone
was turned off

an hour before the robbery
until an hour afterwards.

546

Also, he's the exact
same build and height

547
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:34,686

not enough for a warrant

with his partner,
Detective Frank Dixon.

- Yeah, we think Dixon
is the other copycat?

- No, no way.

562
00:22:55,974 --> 00:22:57,709
I know Dixon.
He's a good man.

563

He can't be the robber.
The heights don't match.

566
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:05,484
- It doesn't mean
that he's not involved.

567
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,718
He signed that report.

568
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:08,386
It means he's covering
for Palmer.

569
00:23:08,453 --> 00:23:10,088

a good reason.

let's bring him in

in Palmer's alibi.

573
00:23:14,092 --> 00:23:15,494
- Dixon's been on the force
a long time.

574
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,995
He's not gonna talk to us.

575
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:19,998
He'll plead the fifth,
ask for his PBA lawyer.

576
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:23,001
- Maybe we make up a story
and try to box him in.

577
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:25,403
- We could,
but it's not gonna work.

578
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:26,471
- Why not?

579
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:28,073
- Police don't trust the FBI.

580
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,141
They don't like 'em
too much either,

581
00:23:29,207 --> 00:23:32,811
so whatever we concoct,
he's gonna see through it.

582
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,115
Just let me talk to him
off the record

583
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:39,017
as a friend.

584
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:41,520
See what I can learn.

Take Scola with you.

And, Tiff, keep your cards
close to the vest.

If Dixon is involved,

588
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:49,027
we don't want him

00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:02,207
What the hell's going on?

592
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:03,508
- What are you talking about?

593
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:04,943
- You and Tiff.

594
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:07,779
It's clear you're not
on the same page.

595
00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:09,881
- That obvious, huh?

596
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:13,084
She, uh,
she used to work with Dixon.

597
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:16,922
He was her training officer,
and she loves the guy, so...

598
00:24:16,988 --> 00:24:19,658
- Hmm.
And you're not sold?

599
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:22,894
I mean, do you think
he might be involved?

600
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:24,462
- He seems like
a nice enough guy,

601
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:27,532
but you never know, right?

602
00:24:29,167 --> 00:24:30,235
- You know, when it's personal,

603
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:33,038
it's easy to make a mistake
you can't walk back from.

604
00:24:33,104 --> 00:24:34,940
Just keep an eye out for her.

605
00:24:35,006 --> 00:24:36,608
Okay?

606
00:24:36,675 --> 00:24:39,477
- Goes without saying.
- I know.

607
00:24:39,544 --> 00:24:40,946
Wanted to say it anyway.

608
00:24:47,886 --> 00:24:49,054

on you like this.

609

Yeah, all she gotta do
is show up.

619
00:25:11,209 --> 00:25:13,111
Hey, I want to apologize
for my partner.

620
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:15,113
He can be a bit of a cowboy
sometimes,

621
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,249
so I get where
you're coming from.

622
00:25:17,315 --> 00:25:20,886
I had a couple of his bullets
whiz past my ear too.

623
00:25:20,952 --> 00:25:23,054
- Appreciate that.
- Mm-hmm.

624
00:25:23,121 --> 00:25:25,123
- So about the arrests.

625
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,993
We were going over some of the
paperwork you guys sent over...

626
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:29,160
- Mm-hmm.
- And saw that

627
00:25:29,227 --> 00:25:30,996
you followed up on a lead
this morning?

628
00:25:31,062 --> 00:25:32,130
- Yeah, it didn't pan out.

629
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:33,231
Got a call on the tip line

630
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:36,534
to meet a potential witness
down at McCarren Park.

Come to find out the guy
just wanted a free cappuccino.

632

For real.

633
00:25:39,905 --> 00:25:42,307
Just some idiot
looking for attention.

634
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:44,209
- Who got stuck paying?

00:39:19,457 --> 00:39:20,725
I was working
yesterday morning.

957
00:39:20,791 --> 00:39:22,093
- Really?

958
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:24,395
'Cause your partner said
you came in late.

959
00:39:26,063 --> 00:39:28,466
You had a personal thing
to take care of?

960
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:31,068
- Looks like your alibi
just went to hell too.

You need any help with that?

963
00:39:39,777 --> 00:39:41,078
- No, I'm almost done.

964
00:39:41,145 --> 00:39:44,715
- Hey, uh, you decide what
you're gonna do about Dixon?

965
00:39:44,782 --> 00:39:46,150
- What is there to do?

966
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:48,419
- Well, he perjured himself
in that report,

967
00:39:48,486 --> 00:39:49,854
obstructed the investigation.

968
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,089
- Isobel already talked
to the AUSA,

969
00:39:52,156 --> 00:39:54,725
and they're not interested
in pursuing federal charges.

970
00:39:54,792 --> 00:39:55,826
- That doesn't mean
that we shouldn't

971
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:57,995
take it back
to his department, right?

972
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:03,434
You told me
that you left the NYPD

973
00:40:03,501 --> 00:40:05,069
to get away from the blue wall.

974
00:40:05,136 --> 00:40:08,038
- This is not about
the blue wall.

975
00:40:08,105 --> 00:40:10,040
It's about Dixon...

976
00:40:12,176 --> 00:40:13,978
A good man and a good cop

977
00:40:14,044 --> 00:40:17,448
who was looking out
for his partner.

978
00:40:17,515 --> 00:40:22,987
So I'm not taking it back
to the NYPD, but...

it's necessary, then...

do what you gotta do.

982
00:40:37,568 --> 00:40:39,970

that murdered Howard.

983
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:47,478
That's enough for me.
