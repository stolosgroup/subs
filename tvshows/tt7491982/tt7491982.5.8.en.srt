1
00:00:13,835 --> 00:00:15,247
Okay, you're all set, Clay.

2
00:00:15,332 --> 00:00:16,656
Just need your John Hancock.

3
00:00:16,741 --> 00:00:18,297
All right. Copy that.

4
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:20,811
Ah, Next stop, Windy City.

5
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:22,108
How are the kiddos?

6
00:00:22,354 --> 00:00:23,991
Eating me out
of house and home.

7
00:00:24,093 --> 00:00:25,476
That's why I took
the graveyard shift.

8
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,829
- Need the cash.
- Yeah, you and me both.

9
00:00:27,993 --> 00:00:29,360
Yo, I'll catch you
on the flip side.

10
00:00:29,444 --> 00:00:30,968
- Take care.
- All right.

11
00:00:48,846 --> 00:00:50,085
What the hell?

12
00:00:51,275 --> 00:00:52,851
Get out of the truck!

13
00:00:53,506 --> 00:00:55,791
- Get out of the truck!
- Come on, you heard him.

14
00:00:55,954 --> 00:00:57,952
Come down out of there.
Let's go. Come on!

15
00:01:01,026 --> 00:01:02,782
- Just wait a minute, just...
- Hey, hey, hey.

16
00:01:02,866 --> 00:01:04,767
Don't talk. Unlock the trailer.

17
00:01:08,805 --> 00:01:10,056
Hurry up!

18
00:01:16,381 --> 00:01:18,032
Quit wasting time!

19
00:01:18,241 --> 00:01:20,159
Look... look, I'm trying, man.

20
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,820
I told you to hurry up!

21
00:01:23,274 --> 00:01:24,558
I'm trying.

22
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:26,015
Do it!

23
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:35,778
All right, come on.

24
00:01:35,863 --> 00:01:37,423
Let's get the stuff
and get out of here.

25
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:39,058
Open it up.

26
00:01:43,732 --> 00:01:45,289
<font color=#FF00FF>*F B I*</font>
<font color=#00FF00>Season 05  Episode 08</font>

Episode Title: <font color=#FFc30f>"Into the Fire"</font>
Aired on: <font color="#00ffff">November 22, 2022.</font>

28
00:01:48,161 --> 00:01:49,612
What are we looking at?

29
00:01:49,697 --> 00:01:51,687
Seems like a
straightforward semi jacking.

30
00:01:51,877 --> 00:01:54,421
Rent-a-cop found the truck and
the dead body around 2:00 a.m.

31
00:01:54,506 --> 00:01:55,590
We ID him yet?

32
00:01:55,675 --> 00:01:57,042
Clay Parker, 47.

33
00:01:57,191 --> 00:01:59,009
Long-haul trucker
for Great Lakes Freight.

34
00:01:59,093 --> 00:02:01,070
Company's based out of Chicago.

35
00:02:01,431 --> 00:02:03,082
Interstate commerce.

36
00:02:03,167 --> 00:02:04,304
Exactly.

37
00:02:04,389 --> 00:02:06,281
- Anything taken?
- Off the corpse? No.

38
00:02:06,476 --> 00:02:08,554
Guy still had 200 bucks
in his wallet.

39
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:10,970
As for the cargo,
shipping manifest

40
00:02:11,055 --> 00:02:13,223
says we're missing exactly
20 half-drum barrels

41
00:02:13,307 --> 00:02:14,812
of ammonium nitrate.

42
00:02:14,897 --> 00:02:17,416
That's roughly 4,000 pounds
of fertilizer.

43
00:02:17,712 --> 00:02:19,078
That's not good.

44
00:02:21,397 --> 00:02:22,547
You got something?

45
00:02:22,632 --> 00:02:24,555
Maybe.

46
00:02:25,053 --> 00:02:26,337
Looks like
a through-and-through.

47
00:02:26,421 --> 00:02:27,838
The caliber looks pretty big.

48
00:02:27,922 --> 00:02:30,242
You guys get that over
to Ballistics?

49
00:02:30,772 --> 00:02:31,886
{\an8}Anything else?
Any witnesses?

50
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:33,321
{\an8}Only the guy
who called it in.

51
00:02:33,461 --> 00:02:35,621
And the robbers were long gone
by the time he got here.

52
00:02:39,979 --> 00:02:42,431
{\an8}Hopefully this camera
will give us what we need.

53
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:43,921
All right, folks.
Here we go.

54
00:02:44,117 --> 00:02:45,956
Sometime before 2:00 a.m.
this morning, a semi truck

55
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,158
gets jacked outside
the Port of Red Hook,

56
00:02:48,242 --> 00:02:50,711
and the driver, Clay Parker,
is killed with a...

57
00:02:50,796 --> 00:02:53,029
What was it?
50-caliber Desert Eagle.

58
00:02:53,114 --> 00:02:55,032
And 4,000 pounds

59
00:02:55,117 --> 00:02:56,758
{\an8}of ammonium nitrate is stolen,

60
00:02:56,844 --> 00:03:00,037
which, unless our perps
are a pair of deranged farmers,

61
00:03:00,121 --> 00:03:01,839
is really only used
for one thing.

62
00:03:01,923 --> 00:03:03,547
- Bombs.
- That's right.

63
00:03:03,691 --> 00:03:04,986
{\an8}It was the key ingredient
in Oklahoma City.

64
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:05,953
So let's dig in.

65
00:03:06,038 --> 00:03:07,557
Elise, how we doing
with that footage Scola found?

66
00:03:07,641 --> 00:03:09,359
Yeah, just finished
the pre-scrub.

67
00:03:09,444 --> 00:03:10,928
All right. Eyes up!

68
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,140
Guy tried to be a hero.

69
00:03:26,913 --> 00:03:28,464
{\an8}Or he knew these guys
meant business,

70
00:03:28,549 --> 00:03:29,767
{\an8}given what he was hauling.

71
00:03:29,851 --> 00:03:31,769
Then let's not let his death
be in vain.

72
00:03:31,853 --> 00:03:33,303
Facial rec is out
of the question.

73
00:03:33,387 --> 00:03:34,738
Ian, what about
height and weight?

74
00:03:34,822 --> 00:03:36,742
According to the math
right now,

75
00:03:36,828 --> 00:03:38,187
robber on the left is 6'2".

76
00:03:38,281 --> 00:03:39,743
Killer on the right is 5'10".

77
00:03:39,828 --> 00:03:41,101
Both roughly 175.

78
00:03:41,185 --> 00:03:42,436
There's nothing remarkable
about the clothes.

79
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,004
{\an8}Just plain black hoodies.

80
00:03:44,088 --> 00:03:45,672
Elise, how are we doing with
the plate on the cargo van?

81
00:03:45,756 --> 00:03:48,360
Digits come back
to a blue Chevy Blazer,

82
00:03:48,445 --> 00:03:51,462
{\an8}which are the same cold plates
used in that robbery

83
00:03:51,547 --> 00:03:52,728
{\an8}last Sunday over
in Woodbridge...

84
00:03:52,812 --> 00:03:54,815
The one we connected
to the Norsemen Brotherhood.

85
00:03:54,899 --> 00:03:56,149
Wait, isn't that the group
that Maggie's

86
00:03:56,233 --> 00:03:57,281
trying to infiltrate?

87
00:03:57,366 --> 00:03:59,152
{\an8}Kelly, give us the vitals
on the Norsemen Brotherhood

88
00:03:59,236 --> 00:04:00,594
{\an8}and their leader, Eric Ward.

89
00:04:00,679 --> 00:04:03,656
The Norsemen Brotherhood is
a group on the FBI Watch List

90
00:04:03,741 --> 00:04:06,360
that thinks America is
changing "too fast."

91
00:04:06,444 --> 00:04:08,133
According to current intel,

92
00:04:08,218 --> 00:04:11,000
we think their leader
in New York, Eric Ward,

93
00:04:11,156 --> 00:04:14,468
stole blasting caps and TNT
from a rock quarry last week,

94
00:04:14,552 --> 00:04:16,436
presumably to build pipe bombs.

95
00:04:16,679 --> 00:04:19,390
Plus, he's a physical match
to the robber on the left,

96
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:21,041
{\an8}the one that wrestles
with Clay Parker

97
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:22,576
before the other guy
shoots him dead.

98
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,411
All right. Call OA.

99
00:04:24,495 --> 00:04:25,812
Have him loop Maggie in.

100
00:04:25,896 --> 00:04:27,784
The quarry robbery may have
only been the beginning.

101
00:04:27,868 --> 00:04:28,985
{\an8}Right.

102
00:04:49,089 --> 00:04:50,439
Hey, Deke.
How's it going?

103
00:04:50,523 --> 00:04:52,790
Hey. Good as ever.

104
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:55,063
- Yeah.
- Is he shooting .38s?

105
00:04:55,148 --> 00:04:56,896
Uh, your brother?

106
00:05:02,525 --> 00:05:04,109
Yeah, it sounds like it.

107
00:05:04,194 --> 00:05:05,890
What's with the
John Wayne special?

108
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:08,716
It's a present
for my nephew's birthday.

109
00:05:08,801 --> 00:05:09,885
Kid's the only person I know

110
00:05:09,969 --> 00:05:11,640
who thinks
I'm cooler than Eric.

111
00:05:11,794 --> 00:05:12,977
Well, him and me.

112
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:14,054
- Heh.
- Can I see it?

113
00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:15,173
Oh, yeah.

114
00:05:16,475 --> 00:05:17,974
- Damn.
- Right?

115
00:05:18,059 --> 00:05:19,180
Mm-hmm.

116
00:05:19,265 --> 00:05:21,204
You kind of look like a poster.

117
00:05:21,288 --> 00:05:22,572
Do I?

118
00:05:22,702 --> 00:05:23,915
Mm-hmm.

119
00:05:24,127 --> 00:05:25,542
I think
you're the best uncle.

120
00:05:25,627 --> 00:05:27,477
- I got to get some more ammo.
- Cool.

121
00:05:27,562 --> 00:05:29,291
Hey, when's that competition?

122
00:05:29,376 --> 00:05:31,868
Six weeks from now. I know.

123
00:05:31,953 --> 00:05:33,247
Can I get you anything?

124
00:05:33,332 --> 00:05:34,742
I'm good.

125
00:05:39,335 --> 00:05:40,687
Hey.

126
00:05:43,438 --> 00:05:44,775
You know,
you don't have to pretend

127
00:05:44,859 --> 00:05:46,674
to like every warm-blooded
poser who shoots here.

128
00:05:46,758 --> 00:05:48,384
Oh, come on.
Deke's sweet.

129
00:05:48,469 --> 00:05:49,963
I mean, he's stuck
in his brother's shadow,

130
00:05:50,047 --> 00:05:52,179
- but he's harmless.
- Sure.

131
00:05:52,351 --> 00:05:54,298
If you like empty talk
about the revolution.

132
00:05:54,383 --> 00:05:56,048
Need a re-up?

133
00:05:56,133 --> 00:05:57,451
Yeah, a couple boxes
of 9-millimeter.

134
00:05:57,535 --> 00:05:59,103
Yeah.

135
00:06:04,116 --> 00:06:05,504
You okay?

136
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:07,799
My brother's been
having a hard time.

137
00:06:07,883 --> 00:06:09,700
Uh, can you hold
the bay open for me?

138
00:06:09,784 --> 00:06:11,375
I'm just gonna
make a call quickly.

139
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:12,711
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

140
00:06:19,861 --> 00:06:21,945
Sorry I pulled you out.

141
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:23,548
- What's going on?
- Remember how we thought

142
00:06:23,632 --> 00:06:25,550
that guy Eric Ward
was building pipe bombs?

143
00:06:25,867 --> 00:06:26,984
Yeah.

144
00:06:27,068 --> 00:06:28,656
Turns out
it might be way worse.

145
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:30,454
Someone matching
his description

146
00:06:30,538 --> 00:06:32,601
just stole 4,000 pounds
of ammonium nitrate

147
00:06:32,719 --> 00:06:35,026
from a terminal near
Red Hook last night.

148
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:37,094
- Whoa, that is a lot...
- Lot of fertilizer.

149
00:06:37,178 --> 00:06:39,130
Plus, the blasting caps
and the TNT that

150
00:06:39,214 --> 00:06:40,765
we think Eric already has,
we could be looking

151
00:06:40,849 --> 00:06:43,953
at another
Oklahoma City situation.

152
00:06:44,719 --> 00:06:46,971
How long to turn the
ammonium nitrate into ANFO?

153
00:06:47,055 --> 00:06:49,930
Our bomb techs
are thinking 48 hours.

154
00:06:50,015 --> 00:06:51,945
Which 12 have already passed.

155
00:06:52,141 --> 00:06:53,672
Who's the second person
in this pic?

156
00:06:53,765 --> 00:06:55,115
The JOC does not know
for sure,

157
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,119
and we're not certain that
that's Eric Ward, but...

158
00:06:58,204 --> 00:07:01,867
Eric Ward is the most capable
of executing a hate crime.

159
00:07:02,031 --> 00:07:04,216
The clock is ticking.
We need to hit the gas.

160
00:07:04,402 --> 00:07:06,004
Okay.
What are you thinking?

161
00:07:09,128 --> 00:07:11,613
Eric works out of his house,
his basement, right?

162
00:07:11,846 --> 00:07:14,344
Yeah, how would we get
access to that?

163
00:07:14,429 --> 00:07:16,347
Deke, his brother.

164
00:07:16,492 --> 00:07:18,102
He's been talking about
a party Eric's gonna throw

165
00:07:18,186 --> 00:07:19,837
for his nephew later today.

166
00:07:19,921 --> 00:07:22,506
I'm gonna get myself an invite,
and I'm gonna plant some bugs.

167
00:07:33,835 --> 00:07:37,047
Wow.

168
00:07:37,192 --> 00:07:38,499
What were you going for?

169
00:07:38,584 --> 00:07:39,618
You just trying
to scare it to death?

170
00:07:39,702 --> 00:07:42,289
Wha... seriously?
That's 20 yards with a pistol.

171
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:44,562
Oh, I didn't realize that
you were in the business

172
00:07:44,646 --> 00:07:45,830
of making excuses.

173
00:07:45,914 --> 00:07:47,298
Oh, okay, then,

174
00:07:47,382 --> 00:07:50,844
Miss Western Indiana
Regional Shooting Champ.

175
00:07:51,975 --> 00:07:54,004
Looked you up on the internet,
Maggie Jones.

176
00:07:54,089 --> 00:07:55,273
Think you can do better?

177
00:07:55,357 --> 00:07:56,507
100%.

178
00:07:56,591 --> 00:07:58,039
I'll bet on that.

179
00:07:58,682 --> 00:08:00,467
Okay.

180
00:08:00,552 --> 00:08:01,569
Name it.

181
00:08:01,715 --> 00:08:03,094
Okay.

182
00:08:03,179 --> 00:08:06,953
If I don't put five bull's eyes
in a row, dead center mass,

183
00:08:07,158 --> 00:08:09,680
I'll pay for your crew's
whole shooting session today.

184
00:08:13,276 --> 00:08:15,128
{\an8}All right, and if you do hit
five in a row?

185
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:17,101
You can invite me
to that party today.

186
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,663
{\an8}Well, that sounds
like a win-win.

187
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,382
Yeah, I'll see you at 5:00.

188
00:08:36,584 --> 00:08:37,875
Yeah, you will.

189
00:08:51,214 --> 00:08:52,331
- Video check?
- Yes.

190
00:08:52,424 --> 00:08:54,097
Video and audio are good.

191
00:08:54,182 --> 00:08:55,800
Please be safe.

192
00:09:07,628 --> 00:09:09,179
- Hey, Deke.
- Hey.

193
00:09:09,264 --> 00:09:11,682
- Welcome to, uh, real life.
- Yeah.

194
00:09:11,766 --> 00:09:13,317
I can't believe how many
of you guys have found women

195
00:09:13,401 --> 00:09:14,941
- who will put up with you.
- Oh, yeah.

196
00:09:15,026 --> 00:09:16,486
Some of us, anyway
Oh, come on.

197
00:09:16,571 --> 00:09:18,613
You're a catch.

198
00:09:18,698 --> 00:09:19,822
- Here's a gift.
- Thank you.

199
00:09:19,907 --> 00:09:21,762
- Not for you.
- Ha, ha.

200
00:09:21,847 --> 00:09:23,122
I'll throw it on the table.
You want a beer?

201
00:09:23,206 --> 00:09:23,988
Yes.

202
00:09:24,073 --> 00:09:25,267
Rock on.

203
00:09:26,991 --> 00:09:28,676
- Hey, Deke.
- Mm-hmm?

204
00:09:28,761 --> 00:09:30,949
- We need to talk.
- What, now?

205
00:09:31,826 --> 00:09:33,254
It's for your brother.

206
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:35,023
Now.

207
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:37,309
{\an8}All good. I can get it.

208
00:09:46,158 --> 00:09:48,081
- Hey.
- Hey.

209
00:09:48,316 --> 00:09:49,761
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

210
00:09:49,846 --> 00:09:51,050
Mm-hmm. Cheers.

211
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:52,166
Cheers.

212
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:55,574
Welcome to the land
of braggadocio.

213
00:09:55,659 --> 00:09:57,074
Not your scene, huh?

214
00:09:57,159 --> 00:09:58,918
No, it's just,
a lot of these guys,

215
00:09:59,003 --> 00:10:02,410
if they actually did a tenth
of what they claim,

216
00:10:02,495 --> 00:10:04,513
they'd be in the Hall of Fame.

217
00:10:04,598 --> 00:10:05,782
Right.

218
00:10:05,867 --> 00:10:07,351
So then what are you
doing here?

219
00:10:07,613 --> 00:10:09,624
I mean, I'm assuming
attendance wasn't mandatory.

220
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:12,405
You're wrong. It was.

221
00:10:12,619 --> 00:10:15,939
Yeah, see, my wife
is Eric's wife's cousin.

222
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,324
Okay.

223
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:20,028
So, yeah,
that's how all these guys

224
00:10:20,113 --> 00:10:22,097
started using the gun range.

225
00:10:22,182 --> 00:10:23,767
Disengage, Maggie.

226
00:10:23,852 --> 00:10:25,526
This is your chance to get
inside while Deke is occupied.

227
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:27,495
Do you know where
the bathroom is?

228
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:30,184
It's gonna be through the hall,
first door on the left.

229
00:10:30,371 --> 00:10:31,627
Thank you.

230
00:10:52,013 --> 00:10:53,664
All right, I'm gonna go
for the beer sign.

231
00:10:53,749 --> 00:10:54,966
Smart.

232
00:10:55,051 --> 00:10:56,486
The black metal ought to blend.

233
00:11:02,805 --> 00:11:05,124
How's that?

234
00:11:05,971 --> 00:11:07,456
Feed's up. Well done.

235
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,093
Get out of there.

236
00:11:09,408 --> 00:11:11,093
Hey, I need a hand
downstairs, come on.

237
00:11:11,177 --> 00:11:13,061
- Somebody's coming.
- Hide.

238
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,596
Yeah, yeah, I'm coming.

239
00:11:19,952 --> 00:11:21,670
None of this
is rocket science.

240
00:11:21,754 --> 00:11:23,952
Neighborhood's changing
for the worse.

241
00:11:24,037 --> 00:11:26,055
If you won't do it,
find someone who will.

242
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,530
Yeah. All right.

243
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,968
Help me with the beer.

244
00:11:35,476 --> 00:11:36,818
What the hell was that?

245
00:11:49,216 --> 00:11:51,468
Relax.
It's just the radiator.

246
00:11:51,584 --> 00:11:52,668
Come on.

247
00:12:06,091 --> 00:12:07,740
That was close.

248
00:12:11,837 --> 00:12:12,821
You okay?

249
00:12:12,905 --> 00:12:14,256
Yeah.

250
00:12:14,683 --> 00:12:16,451
Okay. Let's go. Come on.

251
00:12:18,605 --> 00:12:19,872
Hold on.

252
00:12:22,348 --> 00:12:24,435
Maggie, what are you doing?

253
00:12:24,628 --> 00:12:26,246
There's fertilizer
all over it.

254
00:12:26,384 --> 00:12:27,968
That does look
like the hoodie

255
00:12:28,053 --> 00:12:29,896
that one of the shooters
was wearing.

256
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,818
I need you to hurry, please.

257
00:12:41,035 --> 00:12:42,385
Okay.

258
00:12:42,601 --> 00:12:44,737
Get the evidence bag ready.
I'm coming out.

259
00:13:03,195 --> 00:13:04,984
Chemical signature
checks out... it's AN.

260
00:13:05,069 --> 00:13:07,413
Okay, people. Listen up.

261
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:09,062
Analysis is back
on the sweatshirt

262
00:13:09,147 --> 00:13:10,831
Maggie swiped from the party.

263
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:12,236
It is definitely
ammonium nitrate,

264
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:13,445
which means
practically speaking,

265
00:13:13,529 --> 00:13:14,962
we are barking up the
right tree with Eric Ward,

266
00:13:15,046 --> 00:13:16,664
but legally speaking,
it's not enough.

267
00:13:16,749 --> 00:13:18,546
So how do we tie him
to the fertilizer theft,

268
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,125
and, more importantly,
how do we find the bomb

269
00:13:20,209 --> 00:13:22,261
these... patriots
are trying to build?

270
00:13:22,356 --> 00:13:24,189
Ian, how are we doing with
those two bugs Maggie planted?

271
00:13:24,273 --> 00:13:25,554
Nothing yet.

272
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:26,722
I think I might have found
something else

273
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:27,718
that's relevant, boss.

274
00:13:27,803 --> 00:13:28,733
What are we
looking at, Kelly?

275
00:13:28,818 --> 00:13:30,159
I've been digging
into Eric's financials

276
00:13:30,243 --> 00:13:31,413
over the past 24 hours.

277
00:13:31,498 --> 00:13:33,550
- All quiet on the western front.
- Good book.

278
00:13:33,635 --> 00:13:35,419
I'm sensing there's
a "but" coming.

279
00:13:35,504 --> 00:13:38,223
But this morning, he dropped
a quarter of his life savings

280
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:40,319
to charter a plane
to Canada tomorrow.

281
00:13:40,749 --> 00:13:42,671
He could be
building an alibi.

282
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:44,607
Or more likely,
given what we suspect

283
00:13:44,691 --> 00:13:47,117
of Eric's hands-on approach
to crime in the past...

284
00:13:47,202 --> 00:13:48,991
It's his escape route
after blowing the bomb.

285
00:13:49,076 --> 00:13:50,828
Which means the bomb
is in play.

286
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,077
We're running out of time.

287
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:53,816
- I'll call Maggie and OA.
- Yeah.

288
00:13:56,193 --> 00:13:57,477
What time
does the flight take off?

289
00:13:57,561 --> 00:13:59,212
It's, uh, 6:00 a.m. tomorrow.

290
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:00,748
Okay. Passenger manifest?

291
00:14:00,907 --> 00:14:02,788
Yeah, listed as cargo.

292
00:14:03,376 --> 00:14:05,194
Let's grab Eric
and grill him.

293
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:06,328
No, you read his rap sheet.

294
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:08,230
He doesn't talk to anyone.

295
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:09,932
Plus, there's other people
involved.

296
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:12,501
Look, we grab Eric,
he lawyers up, we're nowhere.

297
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:13,902
Or worse, his accomplice

298
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:15,671
sets off the bomb
earlier than planned.

299
00:14:15,755 --> 00:14:18,241
So you want to keep
working him from your side?

300
00:14:18,804 --> 00:14:20,689
Absolutely.

301
00:14:20,913 --> 00:14:22,564
Okay,
but the harder you push,

302
00:14:22,649 --> 00:14:24,733
the more likely you're gonna
blow your cover, Maggie.

303
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:28,140
My proximity to Eric
is the best play we've got.

304
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,952
Let's use it.

305
00:14:31,179 --> 00:14:32,983
Okay. How?

306
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,190
I'll put a tracker
on his truck.

307
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:36,859
I'm guessing he's
either gonna visit the bomb

308
00:14:36,943 --> 00:14:39,561
or the target
before that plane takes off.

309
00:14:39,824 --> 00:14:41,309
Let's do it. Be careful.

310
00:14:47,817 --> 00:14:49,468
Walking towards the van now.

311
00:14:49,626 --> 00:14:51,928
I got you. Be careful.

312
00:15:08,705 --> 00:15:09,856
What's taking so long?

313
00:15:09,941 --> 00:15:12,043
I... I... I can't get it
to stick.

314
00:15:19,405 --> 00:15:21,064
Okay, there should be
a metal bar

315
00:15:21,149 --> 00:15:22,684
to the left of the gas tank.

316
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,757
Hey, you have company.

317
00:15:38,418 --> 00:15:40,420
- Hey.
- Hey.

318
00:15:42,135 --> 00:15:43,168
The hell you doing down there?

319
00:15:43,252 --> 00:15:44,358
Dropped my phone.

320
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:45,944
Just making a phone call.

321
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:47,046
All the way out here?

322
00:15:47,131 --> 00:15:48,182
Oh.

323
00:15:48,267 --> 00:15:49,467
Yeah, bit of a personal issue.

324
00:15:49,582 --> 00:15:51,500
I didn't want anybody to hear.

325
00:15:51,585 --> 00:15:53,171
Mm.

326
00:15:53,365 --> 00:15:55,249
What happened to you
at the party yesterday?

327
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:56,905
You just disappeared.

328
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:58,007
I know.

329
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:00,160
I'm sorry.
I ended up...

330
00:16:00,245 --> 00:16:01,446
What's going on here?

331
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:07,437
Because it sure as hell looks
like you're crowding my truck.

332
00:16:12,217 --> 00:16:13,655
Nothing.

333
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,382
Just talking about
the party yesterday.

334
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:20,773
Well, maybe next time
you do it away from my truck.

335
00:16:21,117 --> 00:16:22,773
I got to run a few errands.

336
00:16:25,147 --> 00:16:26,364
Okay.

337
00:16:26,449 --> 00:16:27,789
All right,
I'm gonna meet you inside.

338
00:16:27,873 --> 00:16:28,827
Gotta call my brother.

339
00:16:28,942 --> 00:16:31,240
Yeah.
I know all about brothers.

340
00:16:37,897 --> 00:16:39,422
OA, I wasn't able
to plant the tracker.

341
00:16:39,507 --> 00:16:40,516
You gotta follow him now.

342
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,310
He's about 30 seconds out
from your position.

343
00:16:42,394 --> 00:16:44,194
Yeah, I know.

344
00:16:47,069 --> 00:16:49,472
I will do my best.
Headed to the Tahoe now.

345
00:16:52,869 --> 00:16:55,254
Maggie, you're sure
if I leave now,

346
00:16:55,448 --> 00:16:56,498
it's not gonna
leave you exposed?

347
00:16:56,582 --> 00:16:57,866
Yes, yes. Go.

348
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,390
We need to find out
where he's going.

349
00:17:12,758 --> 00:17:14,275
The tracker operation's
busted.

350
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,844
OA is following Eric Ward,

351
00:17:15,989 --> 00:17:17,507
heading south
from Arlene and Roman.

352
00:17:17,592 --> 00:17:19,577
So we need every available
Staten Island unit

353
00:17:19,662 --> 00:17:20,847
to assist with the moving
surveillance.

354
00:17:20,931 --> 00:17:22,682
- I'm on it.
- When support rolls in,

355
00:17:22,842 --> 00:17:23,904
I need someone to take the eye

356
00:17:23,988 --> 00:17:25,193
so I can get back to Maggie
at the range

357
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:26,861
- as soon as possible.
- Okay.

358
00:17:26,946 --> 00:17:28,714
Tiff and Scola
are already on their way.

359
00:17:33,645 --> 00:17:35,663
Jubal, I think
we might be made.

360
00:17:35,755 --> 00:17:38,044
But did... did he make you?

361
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:42,110
Yep, I'm sure. We're made.

362
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,480
Out of the car, Eric!

363
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,411
Hands!

364
00:18:42,366 --> 00:18:44,869
Get out. Now!

365
00:18:46,487 --> 00:18:47,938
What's the problem, officer?

366
00:18:48,023 --> 00:18:51,142
How about 4,000 of missing
fertilizer, for starters?

367
00:19:00,247 --> 00:19:02,483
Let's get him back to 26 Fed.

368
00:19:15,872 --> 00:19:19,897
So is this the part where
you tell me why I'm here?

369
00:19:19,982 --> 00:19:23,068
I think you already know
the answer to that, don't you?

370
00:19:23,152 --> 00:19:26,538
Where were you Thursday night
between midnight and 2:00 a.m.?

371
00:19:26,685 --> 00:19:29,653
I was home with my family.

372
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:34,287
What's this?

373
00:19:34,372 --> 00:19:35,789
Two guys killed
a semi driver,

374
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,638
and this guy right here

375
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,255
has your same height
and your build.

376
00:19:40,368 --> 00:19:42,486
Same as that guy who stole
six blasting caps

377
00:19:42,672 --> 00:19:44,974
from the rock quarry last week.

378
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:47,842
He also had a tattoo on his
right hand, just like you do.

379
00:19:47,927 --> 00:19:49,595
I know a lot of dudes
with this tattoo.

380
00:19:49,741 --> 00:19:51,258
In the Norsemen Brotherhood,
right?

381
00:19:51,435 --> 00:19:52,965
So let's just cut the crap.

382
00:19:53,049 --> 00:19:55,167
We've got a black hoodie
with ammonium nitrate

383
00:19:55,251 --> 00:19:57,803
- and your DNA on it.
- How?

384
00:19:57,887 --> 00:19:59,647
Who's the other guy
in this video, Eric?

385
00:19:59,732 --> 00:20:00,998
Where's the bomb?

386
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:02,537
I got no idea
what you're talking about.

387
00:20:02,621 --> 00:20:03,661
Really?

388
00:20:03,746 --> 00:20:05,872
Then why did you run,
if you're not guilty?

389
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:08,359
Why'd you blow through
those two red lights?

390
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:10,014
Wait a second here, Miss...

391
00:20:10,099 --> 00:20:11,669
Agent.

392
00:20:12,835 --> 00:20:14,070
Sure.

393
00:20:16,205 --> 00:20:18,966
Are you charging me
with a traffic violation?

394
00:20:19,091 --> 00:20:22,061
Because I'm pretty certain
that's not what the FBI does...

395
00:20:22,145 --> 00:20:24,563
Just like I'm certain that
it's not hate to want

396
00:20:24,647 --> 00:20:26,432
the street signs in the
neighborhood you grew up in

397
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:28,551
to be written in English.

398
00:20:30,778 --> 00:20:34,317
So I think I'd like
to talk to my lawyer now.

399
00:20:42,031 --> 00:20:43,271
Okay.

400
00:20:45,049 --> 00:20:46,299
What are you thinking?

401
00:20:46,384 --> 00:20:48,536
He's guilty as hell,
but all we have on him

402
00:20:48,638 --> 00:20:50,489
is a flimsy
concealed-carry bust

403
00:20:50,573 --> 00:20:52,576
and a possession
of a black hoodie,

404
00:20:52,661 --> 00:20:54,727
which won't take him forever
to trace back to Maggie.

405
00:20:54,811 --> 00:20:56,428
Well, we can't hold him
past today...

406
00:20:56,512 --> 00:20:57,796
Unless we find that bomb,

407
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,833
and we are running out of time.
Wait.

408
00:21:00,917 --> 00:21:03,224
Kelly and Ian
might have found something.

409
00:21:04,654 --> 00:21:06,186
All right, fellas.
What do you got?

410
00:21:06,271 --> 00:21:08,377
Hey, this is
the historical GPS data

411
00:21:08,462 --> 00:21:09,946
Ian pulled from Eric's truck.

412
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:12,249
17 addresses,
most of them innocuous.

413
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:14,384
But Eric did make
three separate trips this week

414
00:21:14,468 --> 00:21:16,686
to the same spot in the
South Staten Island woods

415
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:18,455
down near the
Arthur Kill Penitentiary.

416
00:21:18,539 --> 00:21:19,763
What's the red marker?

417
00:21:19,848 --> 00:21:22,170
That's the exact latitude
and longitude of Eric's visits,

418
00:21:22,255 --> 00:21:24,027
and the only sign
of civilization

419
00:21:24,111 --> 00:21:27,297
in the entire radius
is this abandoned farm.

420
00:21:27,567 --> 00:21:29,399
It's a good, off-the-grid
place to build a bomb.

421
00:21:29,483 --> 00:21:31,034
Yeah. Okay. Who lives there?

422
00:21:31,118 --> 00:21:32,802
Uh, no one,
as far as I can tell.

423
00:21:32,886 --> 00:21:34,871
And according to every
property record I can find,

424
00:21:34,955 --> 00:21:38,408
the land is owned by a
Shell corp, Loyalist 76 LLC.

425
00:21:38,492 --> 00:21:39,776
All right, why don't you guys
head out there?

426
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,540
I'll have SWAT
and the bomb techs meet you.

427
00:21:54,908 --> 00:21:56,927
Outbuildings look empty.

428
00:21:57,011 --> 00:22:00,107
I've got one warm body
in the barn.

429
00:22:00,581 --> 00:22:02,458
Copy that.

430
00:22:02,552 --> 00:22:04,684
Also, Scola,
I've got yellow diesel cans

431
00:22:04,769 --> 00:22:06,504
on my side of the barn.

432
00:22:08,989 --> 00:22:11,374
All right, alpha team.
We go on my mark.

433
00:22:11,466 --> 00:22:15,134
In three, two, one.

434
00:22:19,386 --> 00:22:20,837
What the hell is that?

435
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:22,740
It's a perimeter alarm.
All agents, go!

436
00:22:31,081 --> 00:22:33,350
Stop! FBI!

437
00:22:54,803 --> 00:22:56,153
Damn it!

438
00:22:56,238 --> 00:22:58,487
Jubal, we need air support
in South Staten Island.

439
00:22:58,572 --> 00:23:01,691
Our suspect is on a black
dirt bike, model unknown.

440
00:23:01,889 --> 00:23:04,160
He's using the woods as cover.

441
00:23:04,244 --> 00:23:06,463
Hey, we need to set up
a grid search in the woods

442
00:23:06,547 --> 00:23:09,165
in case he decides to lay low
and not hit the highway, okay?

443
00:23:09,249 --> 00:23:10,133
Will do.

444
00:23:10,217 --> 00:23:11,577
All right, guys, listen up.

445
00:23:11,662 --> 00:23:13,209
We need every inch
of this place swept,

446
00:23:13,311 --> 00:23:14,671
photographed, and logged, okay?

447
00:23:14,755 --> 00:23:16,006
Anything that might
give us a clue

448
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:18,475
into this bomb's location,
bag it and tag it.

449
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:19,743
- Hey, Anna?
- Yes, sir?

450
00:23:19,827 --> 00:23:21,211
Let's get a photograph
of these tire tracks

451
00:23:21,295 --> 00:23:22,545
while they're still fresh,
all right?

452
00:23:22,629 --> 00:23:23,580
I'm on it.

453
00:23:23,664 --> 00:23:25,215
- Hey.
- Hey.

454
00:23:25,299 --> 00:23:27,050
Any luck
with the motorcycle guy?

455
00:23:27,134 --> 00:23:28,652
I sent the SWAT team
in a grid search of the woods,

456
00:23:28,736 --> 00:23:29,953
just in case, but...

457
00:23:30,037 --> 00:23:31,287
Yeah, it's pretty easy
to slip the net

458
00:23:31,371 --> 00:23:33,790
- with that much cover.
- Yeah. What about here?

459
00:23:33,874 --> 00:23:35,592
Bomb techs found
cell phone parts

460
00:23:35,676 --> 00:23:37,827
and det-cord scraps
at the workbench.

461
00:23:37,911 --> 00:23:39,796
Also a bunch of peroxide wipes.

462
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,830
Seems like the guy
just finished

463
00:23:40,914 --> 00:23:42,132
wiping down the scene.

464
00:23:42,216 --> 00:23:43,466
So he was covering
his tracks.

465
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:45,663
Seems that way to me, Tiff.

466
00:23:45,843 --> 00:23:47,260
Which means...

467
00:23:47,345 --> 00:23:50,215
The bomb's been built,
and it's now in the wind.

468
00:23:53,338 --> 00:23:54,743
All right, folks. Listen up.

469
00:23:54,828 --> 00:23:56,379
That massive fertilizer bomb
we're chasing

470
00:23:56,463 --> 00:23:58,976
has now been flushed
into the wild.

471
00:23:59,061 --> 00:24:01,747
And we still have no clue where
it's headed or who built it.

472
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:04,554
What we do have is a
medium-height white guy

473
00:24:04,638 --> 00:24:05,609
on a black bike.

474
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:08,179
So I'll take ideas.

475
00:24:08,275 --> 00:24:10,290
We just got the first report
from the bomb lab back.

476
00:24:10,374 --> 00:24:11,761
It looks like,
based on the cell phone parts

477
00:24:11,845 --> 00:24:14,464
ERT recovered, the device will
likely have a remote trigger.

478
00:24:14,548 --> 00:24:17,164
Which suggests a highly
sophisticated bomb,

479
00:24:17,272 --> 00:24:19,193
more sophisticated than
anyone at the Brotherhood

480
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:21,530
profiles as capable of making.

481
00:24:22,723 --> 00:24:24,874
Hey, guys, I think
I might have found something...

482
00:24:24,958 --> 00:24:26,576
Or, rather, someone.

483
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:29,412
Uh, this is a half a mile
from the bomb maker's property.

484
00:24:36,774 --> 00:24:38,221
It's not perfect evidence,
but I don't know

485
00:24:38,305 --> 00:24:39,819
what else he'd be doing there.

486
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,773
Wait, is that...

487
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:45,119
Nick Foster...
The owner of the gun range.

488
00:24:51,882 --> 00:24:53,687
All right,
so the possible new player

489
00:24:53,772 --> 00:24:55,328
on the chessboard
is Nick Foster.

490
00:24:55,413 --> 00:24:56,598
Let's talk about him.
What do we know?

491
00:24:56,682 --> 00:24:58,257
Well, uh, for one thing,
we are certain

492
00:24:58,342 --> 00:24:59,689
that he's not
Norsemen Brotherhood.

493
00:24:59,773 --> 00:25:00,958
Doesn't have the Viking tattoos

494
00:25:01,042 --> 00:25:02,393
or a spot
on the national roster.

495
00:25:02,478 --> 00:25:03,729
Yeah, and according
to Maggie, Nick thinks

496
00:25:03,813 --> 00:25:05,598
most of the Norsemen
Brotherhood are idiots.

497
00:25:05,695 --> 00:25:07,513
Right, but what if Nick
thinks they're idiots

498
00:25:07,598 --> 00:25:09,649
because they don't take
their hate seriously enough?

499
00:25:09,734 --> 00:25:11,892
Maybe he's an "actions speak
louder than words" kind of guy.

500
00:25:11,976 --> 00:25:14,096
Well, it would explain his
partnering up with Eric Ward.

501
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,510
And we know their wives
are cousins.

502
00:25:15,594 --> 00:25:17,945
Right, so let's take it
through that lens.

503
00:25:18,029 --> 00:25:19,280
How does Nick profile
if we assume

504
00:25:19,364 --> 00:25:20,815
he's not so squeaky clean?

505
00:25:20,899 --> 00:25:22,617
Well, he's 5'10", 170,

506
00:25:22,701 --> 00:25:24,252
which makes him
a dead solid build match

507
00:25:24,336 --> 00:25:25,520
for Eric's partner
in the theft,

508
00:25:25,604 --> 00:25:27,121
the actual murderer
of Clay Parker.

509
00:25:27,205 --> 00:25:29,123
And according
to Nick's army files,

510
00:25:29,207 --> 00:25:30,925
he showed a remarkable
aptitude for explosives

511
00:25:31,009 --> 00:25:32,493
at OCS back in '03,

512
00:25:32,577 --> 00:25:34,061
even though he trained
as a tank commander.

513
00:25:34,145 --> 00:25:35,163
He's not just involved.

514
00:25:35,247 --> 00:25:37,484
Nick is the bomb maker.
Call Maggie and OA now.

515
00:25:39,138 --> 00:25:42,374
You know, you got to exhale
before you pull the trigger.

516
00:25:43,616 --> 00:25:45,132
All right. See you tomorrow.

517
00:25:54,381 --> 00:25:55,531
Hey, OA.

518
00:25:55,616 --> 00:25:56,820
I've been waiting
for your call for hours.

519
00:25:56,904 --> 00:25:58,255
What's up with Eric Ward?

520
00:25:58,435 --> 00:26:00,586
He's in the box,
but he's not talking.

521
00:26:00,772 --> 00:26:02,457
Maggie, I don't know
how to tell you this.

522
00:26:02,541 --> 00:26:04,905
We think that
Nick Foster is involved.

523
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:07,023
Nick? How is he involved?

524
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:08,759
The JOC has video
that puts him near the barn

525
00:26:08,843 --> 00:26:10,027
where the bomb was built.

526
00:26:10,112 --> 00:26:12,031
He's a match for the guy
that killed Clay Parker,

527
00:26:12,115 --> 00:26:13,533
and he also
has bomb-building expertise

528
00:26:13,617 --> 00:26:15,304
from his time in the army.

529
00:26:15,389 --> 00:26:16,710
What do you want me to do?

530
00:26:16,795 --> 00:26:18,239
Well, right now,
he is in the wind,

531
00:26:18,323 --> 00:26:19,265
so can you look
around the range,

532
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:21,175
see if you can find anything
that can give us a clue

533
00:26:21,259 --> 00:26:22,543
where he is, where he's going?

534
00:26:22,627 --> 00:26:23,678
N... no.

535
00:26:23,762 --> 00:26:24,883
He doesn't even have
a proper office.

536
00:26:24,967 --> 00:26:27,419
Plus, it just seems like
he has everything on his phone.

537
00:26:27,504 --> 00:26:29,319
If he's in the wind, I...
I don't...

538
00:26:31,907 --> 00:26:34,325
OA, he just pulled up.

539
00:26:34,432 --> 00:26:36,250
- He's here.
- What?

540
00:26:36,374 --> 00:26:37,999
Why would he be coming back
to the range?

541
00:26:38,084 --> 00:26:39,469
I don't know.

542
00:26:39,554 --> 00:26:41,044
- Do we arrest him?
- No, no, no, we can't.

543
00:26:41,128 --> 00:26:42,546
The JOC said that
we were supposed to track

544
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:44,415
his movements
until we find the bomb,

545
00:26:44,538 --> 00:26:45,790
but it's too close
to closing time, Maggie.

546
00:26:45,874 --> 00:26:47,192
You got to get
the hell out of there.

547
00:26:47,276 --> 00:26:48,536
Or I could stay.

548
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:49,827
And do what?

549
00:26:49,912 --> 00:26:51,297
It's getting a little
suspicious how much time

550
00:26:51,381 --> 00:26:52,932
you are spending
at the range, right?

551
00:26:53,017 --> 00:26:54,202
You don't
have to prove anything.

552
00:26:54,286 --> 00:26:55,670
No, I'm not
proving anything.

553
00:26:55,755 --> 00:26:57,494
There's a bomb out there,
and until we know where it is,

554
00:26:57,578 --> 00:26:59,562
I'm gonna ride
this thing out.

555
00:27:07,327 --> 00:27:08,778
Hey.

556
00:27:09,166 --> 00:27:10,554
Hey.

557
00:27:10,888 --> 00:27:12,128
Everyone else gone for the day?

558
00:27:12,377 --> 00:27:14,054
Yeah,
Randy and Bruce just left.

559
00:27:14,139 --> 00:27:15,961
Um, would you mind
if I actually stick around?

560
00:27:16,046 --> 00:27:18,765
You know, squeeze off a few
more rounds after closing?

561
00:27:18,882 --> 00:27:21,235
The competition's
coming up quick.

562
00:27:21,319 --> 00:27:23,004
Yeah, sure.
That's fine, I guess.

563
00:27:23,088 --> 00:27:26,307
Uh, you haven't seen Eric Ward

564
00:27:26,391 --> 00:27:28,898
in the last few hours,
have you?

565
00:27:28,983 --> 00:27:30,834
Not since this morning. Why?

566
00:27:31,007 --> 00:27:33,359
Well, he was supposed to
help me move some furniture,

567
00:27:33,444 --> 00:27:35,279
and I ended up having
to do it myself.

568
00:27:38,074 --> 00:27:41,561
And there wasn't anyone strange

569
00:27:41,761 --> 00:27:43,245
hanging around
the gun range today?

570
00:27:43,408 --> 00:27:45,905
No, not that I can think of.

571
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:48,366
What... what's going on?

572
00:27:48,451 --> 00:27:51,236
It's nothing. Yeah.

573
00:27:51,321 --> 00:27:54,501
Oh, hey, uh,
why don't you come with me

574
00:27:54,586 --> 00:27:56,337
to Bailey's and grab a beer?

575
00:27:56,421 --> 00:27:58,163
- What, right now?
- Yeah.

576
00:27:58,305 --> 00:28:00,990
Yeah, it seems like
you got plenty of training in,

577
00:28:01,075 --> 00:28:04,773
and I kind of
feel like socializing...

578
00:28:05,781 --> 00:28:08,023
At least for a few hours,
anyways.

579
00:28:09,669 --> 00:28:11,287
Okay, uh, yeah.

580
00:28:11,465 --> 00:28:13,650
Yeah, cool.
Let me just grab my jacket.

581
00:28:13,805 --> 00:28:15,046
Be out in a sec.

582
00:28:47,124 --> 00:28:48,692
That's too dangerous.

583
00:29:05,257 --> 00:29:07,774
Jubal, guys, you sure
we can't arrest this guy?

584
00:29:07,859 --> 00:29:10,111
No, we have enough
for a sneak-and-peek warrant,

585
00:29:10,195 --> 00:29:11,188
and that is it.

586
00:29:11,273 --> 00:29:12,365
Yeah, and even
if we arrest him,

587
00:29:12,449 --> 00:29:14,033
the odds of him cooperating
are slim.

588
00:29:14,118 --> 00:29:16,237
Then all we have is 4,000
pounds of missing explosives.

589
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:18,139
With no idea when or where
it's gonna go off.

590
00:29:18,224 --> 00:29:21,110
I get that, but trying to
steal his phone is too risky.

591
00:29:21,195 --> 00:29:23,413
OA, I get it.
You're worried.

592
00:29:23,498 --> 00:29:25,850
But chances are Nick's
taking her to a public place

593
00:29:25,935 --> 00:29:27,319
so he can build out his alibi.

594
00:29:27,511 --> 00:29:29,463
Now, if Maggie thinks that
she can get us that phone,

595
00:29:29,547 --> 00:29:30,931
that's good enough for me.

596
00:29:31,015 --> 00:29:33,701
Now, Scola and Ian will
meet you there at Bailey's.

597
00:29:37,889 --> 00:29:39,407
All right, talk about
the parking lot

598
00:29:39,491 --> 00:29:40,851
- and make the switch.
- All right.

599
00:29:43,027 --> 00:29:45,579
This guy is packing
serious heat in his waistband,

600
00:29:45,663 --> 00:29:47,448
and he keeps checking
his phone every two minutes.

601
00:29:47,532 --> 00:29:49,047
Please stay alert.

602
00:29:49,132 --> 00:29:50,583
We're good.

603
00:29:58,062 --> 00:29:59,330
Thank you.

604
00:30:05,267 --> 00:30:07,508
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

605
00:30:07,652 --> 00:30:10,477
To quiet people
who get things done.

606
00:30:10,562 --> 00:30:12,399
Nice.

607
00:30:12,901 --> 00:30:14,920
My dad used to say it
all the time.

608
00:30:15,005 --> 00:30:16,622
It's like a Midwestern thing.

609
00:30:16,775 --> 00:30:18,193
Your father sounds
like a good man.

610
00:30:18,363 --> 00:30:19,586
He is.

611
00:30:19,671 --> 00:30:21,456
He's actually the one
who taught me to shoot.

612
00:30:21,541 --> 00:30:24,219
Oh, come on, man.
I'm sorry to bother you guys.

613
00:30:24,304 --> 00:30:26,153
You don't happen to know
who's driving this Explorer

614
00:30:26,237 --> 00:30:27,899
out here, do you?

615
00:30:27,984 --> 00:30:29,352
The guy boxed me in.

616
00:30:31,549 --> 00:30:33,200
Yeah, yeah. No, man.

617
00:30:33,285 --> 00:30:34,302
Sorry.

618
00:30:34,387 --> 00:30:35,571
Thanks anyway, brother.

619
00:30:35,656 --> 00:30:37,305
Yeah.

620
00:30:37,703 --> 00:30:39,504
- That sucks.
- Yeah.

621
00:30:44,255 --> 00:30:46,440
- Okay.
- Did you get it?

622
00:30:46,532 --> 00:30:48,049
Got it.

623
00:30:54,744 --> 00:30:56,045
All right.

624
00:31:01,434 --> 00:31:03,186
How's our girl doing in there?

625
00:31:03,942 --> 00:31:05,510
Still doing all right.

626
00:31:07,412 --> 00:31:09,797
And you think
that's New York?

627
00:31:10,055 --> 00:31:13,031
Yeah,
for better or worse, I do.

628
00:31:13,116 --> 00:31:14,233
I mean, think about it.

629
00:31:14,318 --> 00:31:15,908
Dating back
to George Washington,

630
00:31:15,993 --> 00:31:18,412
this has always been
where real America

631
00:31:18,497 --> 00:31:20,172
has always made its stand.

632
00:31:20,257 --> 00:31:21,867
You're an interesting lady,
Maggie.

633
00:31:23,861 --> 00:31:25,594
I was also very good
at bar games.

634
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:27,383
Hey, can we please get, um...

635
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:28,749
- Let me check something.
- A couple quarters

636
00:31:28,833 --> 00:31:30,602
and a shot glass?

637
00:31:30,687 --> 00:31:32,172
Thank you, perfect.

638
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:35,684
- What the... hey, hey, hey.
- What?

639
00:31:35,769 --> 00:31:36,920
What is this?

640
00:31:37,005 --> 00:31:38,189
That's my phone.

641
00:31:38,274 --> 00:31:39,883
Okay, so where's mine?

642
00:31:39,968 --> 00:31:41,019
I don't know.

643
00:31:41,104 --> 00:31:42,288
I don't have it.

644
00:31:42,373 --> 00:31:44,078
I mean,
maybe you left it at the bar?

645
00:31:47,411 --> 00:31:49,130
How long have you been
shooting at my range?

646
00:31:49,214 --> 00:31:51,165
- I don't...
- How long exactly?

647
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:52,601
Like, a week and a half.

648
00:31:52,686 --> 00:31:54,852
- Okay, why are you grilling me?
- Okay.

649
00:31:54,937 --> 00:31:56,891
You have three seconds
to tell me

650
00:31:56,976 --> 00:31:58,060
who you work for, Maggie.

651
00:31:58,145 --> 00:32:00,464
- I don't work for anyone.
- Three.

652
00:32:00,549 --> 00:32:01,667
I don't know
why you're grilling me.

653
00:32:01,751 --> 00:32:03,936
- Two.
- What is this about?

654
00:32:04,021 --> 00:32:05,372
- One.
- Nick Foster, FBI!

655
00:32:05,457 --> 00:32:07,375
- Hands up.
- Put 'em up!

656
00:32:14,729 --> 00:32:16,814
- Get what you need?
- Yeah.

657
00:32:16,899 --> 00:32:18,422
Took Ian a minute,

658
00:32:19,184 --> 00:32:20,702
but Nick's phone
was a gold mine.

659
00:32:20,787 --> 00:32:23,172
Deke Ward has the bomb,
and he's headed to a fundraiser

660
00:32:23,257 --> 00:32:24,442
- in Port Richmond.
- How much time do we have?

661
00:32:24,526 --> 00:32:25,539
We have about an hour
till the bomb's

662
00:32:25,623 --> 00:32:26,724
supposed to explode.

663
00:32:28,468 --> 00:32:29,516
All right, listen up.

664
00:32:29,658 --> 00:32:30,943
According to the intel
on Nick Foster's phone,

665
00:32:31,027 --> 00:32:32,721
we now know the target
is a charity fundraiser

666
00:32:32,805 --> 00:32:35,212
for refugee resettlement,
Advanced Light Gardens,

667
00:32:35,297 --> 00:32:36,427
in Port Richmond.

668
00:32:36,511 --> 00:32:39,252
And we also know that
the bomb is being delivered

669
00:32:39,337 --> 00:32:40,654
by Eric Ward's brother Deke.

670
00:32:40,738 --> 00:32:42,892
Now, the good news is,
Maggie and OA are set up

671
00:32:42,977 --> 00:32:43,724
with the tactical team

672
00:32:43,808 --> 00:32:45,359
to intercept Deke
in Port Richmond.

673
00:32:45,443 --> 00:32:46,893
The bad news is,
even though he is en route,

674
00:32:46,977 --> 00:32:49,025
we do not know what kind
of car Deke is driving,

675
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:50,530
so let's dig in,
work that problem.

676
00:32:50,614 --> 00:32:52,733
Okay, well, just stating
the obvious here,

677
00:32:52,817 --> 00:32:54,401
we're looking for something
that can handle the payload.

678
00:32:54,485 --> 00:32:56,570
So at 4,000 pounds
of fertilizer

679
00:32:56,654 --> 00:32:58,142
plus diesel fuel
and barrel weight,

680
00:32:58,227 --> 00:33:00,641
we're talking a 1-ton pickup
or a delivery van.

681
00:33:00,725 --> 00:33:01,954
We've also got
the tire tracks

682
00:33:02,039 --> 00:33:03,777
we found in the bomber's barn.

683
00:33:03,861 --> 00:33:07,102
Tread report says they're
run-flat, 245/75R16s,

684
00:33:07,187 --> 00:33:09,774
which,
in the heavy-duty cargo class,

685
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:12,179
only currently comes standard
on the GMC Savana.

686
00:33:12,264 --> 00:33:13,445
Now we're talking.

687
00:33:13,673 --> 00:33:15,191
Plus, if you're coming up
from South Staten Island,

688
00:33:15,275 --> 00:33:17,190
you basically got to take the
West Shore Expressway, right?

689
00:33:17,274 --> 00:33:19,159
Okay.
Can we scrub for a GMC Savana?

690
00:33:19,243 --> 00:33:20,719
I'm already on it.

691
00:33:20,804 --> 00:33:22,121
Wait.

692
00:33:22,372 --> 00:33:23,756
Check this out.

693
00:33:29,805 --> 00:33:31,570
Okay, okay, is that...

694
00:33:31,655 --> 00:33:33,273
Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay,
that's him.

695
00:33:33,357 --> 00:33:37,009
That's Deke at mile marker 17
in a blue GMC cargo van.

696
00:33:37,094 --> 00:33:38,011
How old is this video?

697
00:33:38,095 --> 00:33:40,280
It was taken
three minutes ago.

698
00:33:40,414 --> 00:33:43,083
Puts him roughly two minutes
out from Maggie and OA.

699
00:33:49,974 --> 00:33:51,563
JOC says Deke's
making the turn.

700
00:33:51,842 --> 00:33:54,906
Cruisers are on standby
ready to box him in.

701
00:33:55,228 --> 00:33:56,508
There he is.

702
00:33:56,593 --> 00:33:58,695
Let's go stop a bomb.

703
00:34:08,772 --> 00:34:11,057
Get out of the car, Deke!

704
00:34:11,157 --> 00:34:12,844
Now!

705
00:34:13,506 --> 00:34:15,608
This is the remote trigger.

706
00:34:17,382 --> 00:34:19,328
Take it easy.

707
00:34:21,346 --> 00:34:22,847
So get back.

708
00:34:25,357 --> 00:34:26,357
Hey, hey.

709
00:34:26,444 --> 00:34:28,428
Deke, Deke.

710
00:34:28,512 --> 00:34:29,963
It's me.

711
00:34:30,047 --> 00:34:31,563
You're FBI?

712
00:34:31,712 --> 00:34:32,929
Don't do this.

713
00:34:33,014 --> 00:34:34,470
- You lying piece of...
- Hey, hey, hey, I...

714
00:34:34,554 --> 00:34:36,860
I am here to help you.

715
00:34:41,559 --> 00:34:42,893
Tell me what you want.

716
00:34:45,822 --> 00:34:47,307
I want to get the hell
out of the country.

717
00:34:47,391 --> 00:34:48,709
That's what I want, all right?

718
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:51,056
It means I need a car
or a plane.

719
00:34:51,141 --> 00:34:53,120
Okay.
We can make that happen.

720
00:34:53,204 --> 00:34:55,018
I'm gonna have to make
some phone calls, though.

721
00:34:55,102 --> 00:34:57,524
And if anyone tries to
evacuate the apartment complex

722
00:34:57,664 --> 00:35:01,672
or takes a step closer,
we all die.

723
00:35:02,041 --> 00:35:03,326
You understand?

724
00:35:03,411 --> 00:35:04,912
So get back!

725
00:35:07,418 --> 00:35:09,970
- Get back.
- Okay. Okay.

726
00:35:10,141 --> 00:35:12,039
Okay, law enforcement,
stay back!

727
00:35:12,123 --> 00:35:13,572
I need law enforcement
to stay back.

728
00:35:13,657 --> 00:35:15,320
Give this man his space.

729
00:35:17,796 --> 00:35:21,216
10-10, all operators
fall back, fall back.

730
00:35:29,272 --> 00:35:30,990
I understand. Thank you.

731
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:33,512
That was the engineer of the
Hazardous Devices School.

732
00:35:33,644 --> 00:35:35,242
Based on payload modeling,
he says that

733
00:35:35,327 --> 00:35:36,445
there could be
at least 500 people

734
00:35:36,529 --> 00:35:37,880
within the potential
blast radius.

735
00:35:38,091 --> 00:35:39,868
Okay, can we sneak people
out the back stairwell

736
00:35:39,952 --> 00:35:40,758
of the apartment?

737
00:35:40,843 --> 00:35:43,118
I mean, if we're careful,
but only a couple at a time.

738
00:35:43,203 --> 00:35:44,844
- That's Maggie.
- All right. Throw it up.

739
00:35:46,222 --> 00:35:47,472
Hey.

740
00:35:47,557 --> 00:35:48,917
What's the situation
on the ground?

741
00:35:49,069 --> 00:35:50,944
Deke is in the van.
Snipers are in position.

742
00:35:51,029 --> 00:35:53,040
We are just waiting for the
green light to take the shot.

743
00:35:53,124 --> 00:35:55,015
Hold on a second.
I think I can talk him down.

744
00:35:55,099 --> 00:35:57,093
Maggie,
what makes you say that?

745
00:35:57,264 --> 00:35:58,852
I know what makes him tick.

746
00:35:58,936 --> 00:36:00,554
Okay, with all due respect,
Maggie, that's ridiculous.

747
00:36:00,638 --> 00:36:01,975
You heard his threat.

748
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,746
Anyone approaches the van,
he's gonna blow the bomb, okay?

749
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:05,399
I think our snipers
should take the shot.

750
00:36:05,483 --> 00:36:07,394
Well, that comes
with risks as well.

751
00:36:07,478 --> 00:36:09,249
Exactly.

752
00:36:09,492 --> 00:36:11,310
OA, this isn't some guy
with a 9-millimeter

753
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,058
holding hostages in a bank.

754
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:15,908
He's got 4,000 pounds
of explosives.

755
00:36:16,054 --> 00:36:19,374
Our sniper misses him
by 1/16 of an inch,

756
00:36:19,514 --> 00:36:21,859
Deke puts his thumb
on that trigger, we're dead.

757
00:36:23,327 --> 00:36:25,378
- I like my odds better.
- So what are you gonna do?

758
00:36:25,462 --> 00:36:27,866
You want to stroll across
that clearing, unprotected?

759
00:36:27,975 --> 00:36:31,718
No, I want to do my job
and save a bunch of lives.

760
00:36:37,074 --> 00:36:39,426
Keep the snipers
on standby for now.

761
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:41,714
Maggie, we're gonna do it
your way.

762
00:37:13,277 --> 00:37:14,589
What the...

763
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:26,292
Back off! You see this? Huh?

764
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:28,487
- Deke.
- Get back!

765
00:37:28,659 --> 00:37:30,635
Get the hell back.

766
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,495
Get out of the van
so we can talk.

767
00:37:32,596 --> 00:37:34,714
Get out of here,
Maggie... now!

768
00:37:34,798 --> 00:37:37,253
Please, just get out
of the van.

769
00:37:37,478 --> 00:37:38,645
Come on.

770
00:37:41,351 --> 00:37:44,704
I know who you are
and who you're not.

771
00:37:44,955 --> 00:37:46,885
You don't know anything
about me.

772
00:37:47,003 --> 00:37:48,861
That's not true.

773
00:37:48,946 --> 00:37:51,598
I know you don't think
your brother respects you,

774
00:37:51,682 --> 00:37:54,000
and now you're out here,
you know,

775
00:37:54,084 --> 00:37:55,468
trying to prove that
you're strong

776
00:37:55,552 --> 00:37:57,651
by doing some brave act.

777
00:38:00,065 --> 00:38:04,185
Is it worth it, Deke,
now that you're here?

778
00:38:04,355 --> 00:38:06,006
Is it worth dying over?

779
00:38:13,228 --> 00:38:14,963
Come on.

780
00:38:16,951 --> 00:38:18,335
Look, as bad
as the situation is,

781
00:38:18,475 --> 00:38:20,471
you have a chance
to walk it back right now.

782
00:38:21,907 --> 00:38:25,346
I need you to get out of the
van and hand me the trigger.

783
00:38:26,344 --> 00:38:27,761
No.

784
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,918
I need that plane.
Where are we on that?

785
00:38:30,003 --> 00:38:32,806
I'm working on it,
but I'm telling you,

786
00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:35,425
your best move is to surrender.

787
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,073
Please.

788
00:38:43,357 --> 00:38:44,491
Let's move.

789
00:38:46,389 --> 00:38:47,651
Look.

790
00:38:51,975 --> 00:38:53,460
You haven't killed anyone...

791
00:38:53,544 --> 00:38:55,354
Not yet.

792
00:38:55,559 --> 00:38:56,810
You're just a delivery man.

793
00:38:56,996 --> 00:38:58,286
But if the delivery
doesn't make it

794
00:38:58,370 --> 00:39:00,018
and the bomb never explodes...

795
00:39:07,048 --> 00:39:08,866
You're clear.

796
00:39:19,587 --> 00:39:21,055
Please.

797
00:39:34,588 --> 00:39:36,440
I just wanted... ow!

798
00:39:36,658 --> 00:39:39,081
Let's go.
Let's see your hands.

799
00:39:39,189 --> 00:39:41,241
I just wanted to show them
that I could do it, you know?

800
00:39:41,325 --> 00:39:43,096
I know.

801
00:39:43,262 --> 00:39:45,381
You did the right thing.

802
00:39:45,707 --> 00:39:47,307
Yeah.

803
00:39:47,747 --> 00:39:50,503
You still look like a poster
in your FBI vest.

804
00:39:53,904 --> 00:39:55,370
Do I?

805
00:40:05,465 --> 00:40:06,816
Hey.

806
00:40:07,042 --> 00:40:08,735
How'd it go with Deke?

807
00:40:09,057 --> 00:40:10,776
He agreed to cooperate.

808
00:40:11,029 --> 00:40:12,280
He's gonna
flip on his brother?

809
00:40:12,389 --> 00:40:13,473
Yeah.

810
00:40:13,557 --> 00:40:14,541
I guess they gave him
a good deal.

811
00:40:14,625 --> 00:40:15,775
He bit.

812
00:40:15,859 --> 00:40:18,195
That's not why
I came back here, though.

813
00:40:20,355 --> 00:40:21,956
I think we need to talk.

814
00:40:23,934 --> 00:40:25,323
Talk about what?

815
00:40:25,448 --> 00:40:28,505
Us and this dynamic.

816
00:40:30,915 --> 00:40:32,726
I could tell you were
getting a little agitated,

817
00:40:32,810 --> 00:40:34,327
but I was just feeling
like you were

818
00:40:34,411 --> 00:40:37,986
taking unnecessary chances,
like you were overcompensating.

819
00:40:38,071 --> 00:40:39,472
Mm-hmm, okay.

820
00:40:42,085 --> 00:40:44,221
I know that I've been
gone for a while.

821
00:40:44,456 --> 00:40:47,740
I wasn't trying to prove
anything out there today.

822
00:40:49,381 --> 00:40:51,399
I'm just being me.

823
00:40:51,695 --> 00:40:54,721
I'm doing my job.
I'm relying on my instincts.

824
00:40:55,176 --> 00:40:57,761
And I was doing my job,

825
00:40:57,901 --> 00:40:59,159
trying to be a good partner
to you.

826
00:40:59,243 --> 00:41:00,879
Yes, by protecting me
and making sure

827
00:41:00,964 --> 00:41:02,822
that I don't get hurt.

828
00:41:02,906 --> 00:41:04,824
I... I appreciate that.

829
00:41:04,908 --> 00:41:06,370
I do.

830
00:41:06,844 --> 00:41:09,292
But it's going too far.

831
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:11,761
Too far?

832
00:41:12,049 --> 00:41:14,761
What's going too far
was almost losing you

833
00:41:14,846 --> 00:41:17,370
behind that glass,
when I couldn't do my job,

834
00:41:17,454 --> 00:41:18,872
when I couldn't help you,
Maggie.

835
00:41:18,956 --> 00:41:20,823
And I don't...

836
00:41:21,469 --> 00:41:23,138
That's what went too far.

837
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:31,072
You blame yourself for what
happened in the sarin lab?

838
00:41:31,157 --> 00:41:32,794
Of course I blame myself
for what happened.

839
00:41:32,878 --> 00:41:34,187
Hey.

840
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:36,143
That wasn't your fault.

841
00:41:38,299 --> 00:41:40,057
You didn't do anything wrong.

842
00:41:40,973 --> 00:41:42,474
Then whose fault was it?

843
00:41:43,981 --> 00:41:45,706
Nobody's.

844
00:41:46,632 --> 00:41:48,089
That's the job.

845
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,205
It's the risk we take.

846
00:42:02,012 --> 00:42:04,206
We make a really great team.

847
00:42:11,090 --> 00:42:12,925
Can we get back to that?

848
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,949
I'd like that.

849
00:42:23,587 --> 00:42:24,985
Let's get a drink.

850
00:42:32,047 --> 00:42:34,476
