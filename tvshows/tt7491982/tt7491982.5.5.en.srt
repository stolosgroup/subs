00:00:03,266 --> 00:00:04,549
<i>Eva won her big race.</i>

2
00:00:04,633 --> 00:00:06,226
<i>She can't wait
to show you her medal.</i>

3
00:00:06,311 --> 00:00:08,052
<i>And Bella made you
some brownies.</i>

4
00:00:08,137 --> 00:00:10,875
Right.
Well, GPS says 26 minutes.

5
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:13,205
<i>The girls are so excited.</i>

6
00:00:13,297 --> 00:00:14,748
Good.

7
00:00:14,973 --> 00:00:16,290
Man, I am too.

8
00:00:16,381 --> 00:00:18,984
<i>They can't wait
for you to get home.</i>

9
00:00:19,218 --> 00:00:21,967
<i>Oh, and we're all packed
for the beach.</i>

10
00:00:22,051 --> 00:00:24,679
It's been a crazy week.

11
00:00:25,491 --> 00:00:27,409
I'll be seeing you soon.

12
00:00:27,656 --> 00:00:28,907
Love you.

13
00:00:28,992 --> 00:00:30,777
<i>Love you too.</i>

14
00:01:03,244 --> 00:01:05,244

16
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:09,935
It's a little
hard to tell now,

17
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:13,817
but our vic is Frank Leone,
58, out of Forest Hills.

18
00:01:13,902 --> 00:01:15,691
Forest Hills.
That's a nice address.

19
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:18,153
My dad used to drive us around
pointing at all the big houses

20
00:01:18,237 --> 00:01:19,746
giving us the someday speech.

21
00:01:19,831 --> 00:01:21,811
The American dream.

22
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:24,581
Guess this is the flip side
of all that aspiration.

23
00:01:24,665 --> 00:01:27,970
That's $30,000 hanging
off of a dead man's wrist.

24
00:01:28,173 --> 00:01:29,857
Means the shooter
only wanted one thing.

25
00:01:30,037 --> 00:01:31,621
Make sure he was dead.

26
00:01:31,705 --> 00:01:33,090
Between the bling
and the two shooters,

27
00:01:33,174 --> 00:01:34,423
we figured it's a hit.

28
00:01:34,508 --> 00:01:37,290
So the boss says let's put some
federal tax dollars to work.

29
00:01:37,378 --> 00:01:39,298
Okay.
We appreciate the heads up.

30
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:44,809
These are assault
shotgun rounds.

31
00:01:44,969 --> 00:01:46,595
Heavy duty stuff.
We used them in Mosul

32
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,165
for close quarters work.

33
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,751
Work?

34
00:01:49,836 --> 00:01:50,854
Work.

35
00:01:52,363 --> 00:01:53,581
Let's go ahead
and bag up the shells.

36
00:01:53,665 --> 00:01:55,083
See if we can dig out any slugs

37
00:01:55,168 --> 00:01:57,416
and pull for prints or DNA.

38
00:01:57,501 --> 00:01:59,987
And let's dust
and scrub this door.

39
00:02:00,072 --> 00:02:02,432
Shooter had to get in pretty
close for this final heads hot.

40
00:02:02,536 --> 00:02:04,221
Maybe we'll get lucky
with some prints.

41
00:02:04,411 --> 00:02:05,877
There any cameras
in the area?

42
00:02:05,994 --> 00:02:08,997
One by the entrance
of the paper plant, broken.

43
00:02:10,416 --> 00:02:12,234
- That's our only witness?
- Yep.

44
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,670
He says there were
six or seven others,

45
00:02:13,754 --> 00:02:15,221
but they just skedaddled.

46
00:02:15,364 --> 00:02:16,666
They know something we don't?

47
00:02:16,751 --> 00:02:18,803
In this neighborhood,
snitches get stitches.

48
00:02:19,153 --> 00:02:20,637
That one's a newcomer.

49
00:02:20,721 --> 00:02:23,606
He gave me the whole
defund the police rant.

50
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:25,262
So I'm rolling
around the corner.

51
00:02:25,347 --> 00:02:26,664
And first, I'm thinking like,

52
00:02:26,749 --> 00:02:29,458
"This has to be, like,
a movie set or something."

53
00:02:29,543 --> 00:02:33,089
But then I'm realizing, there's
no crew, there's no camera,

54
00:02:33,174 --> 00:02:34,617
so then it hits me,
it's like, "Oh, wow.

55
00:02:34,701 --> 00:02:36,232
This is like that real-deal
New York stuff."

56
00:02:36,316 --> 00:02:38,731
Right.
So you said two shooters?

57
00:02:38,839 --> 00:02:43,864
Driver was 6'2"-ish,
passenger was 5'6"-ish?

58
00:02:43,949 --> 00:02:45,133
Correct.

59
00:02:45,218 --> 00:02:46,708
The two shooters
were wearing masks.

60
00:02:46,842 --> 00:02:49,341
Did you see their hands?
Maybe notice what race?

61
00:02:49,426 --> 00:02:51,411
Mm, tall dude was white.

62
00:02:51,496 --> 00:02:53,747
And the other maybe brown-ish?

63
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,173
Speaking of which, if you cops
were nicer to people of color,

64
00:02:56,257 --> 00:02:58,552
you might have a little
more help around here.

65
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,177
We are not cops.
But thank you for that tip.

66
00:03:01,262 --> 00:03:02,980
We will do just that.

67
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:05,520
<i>Anything else?
Anything at all stand out?</i>

68
00:03:05,807 --> 00:03:08,050
The one who fired
the pistol was a lefty.

69
00:03:08,135 --> 00:03:09,427
Okay, good.

70
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:11,853
The van, did you catch a plate?

71
00:03:11,938 --> 00:03:14,115
Maybe notice any other
details about the vehicle?

72
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,359
One of the hubcaps
was missing, like,

73
00:03:16,443 --> 00:03:17,494
the thing in the middle,

74
00:03:17,578 --> 00:03:19,862
the little, like,
emblem thingy.

75
00:03:19,946 --> 00:03:21,831
Uh, passenger side, front tire.

76
00:03:21,915 --> 00:03:23,533
You don't miss much, do you?

77
00:03:23,617 --> 00:03:25,235
I'm an artist.

78
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:26,336
Details are my life.

79
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:27,775
Ours too.

80
00:03:28,129 --> 00:03:29,596
Thanks.

81
00:03:30,152 --> 00:03:31,736
The killers went right
on Broadway.

82
00:03:31,821 --> 00:03:32,822
Okay.

83
00:03:32,907 --> 00:03:34,318
Let's work our way out
from there.

84
00:03:34,423 --> 00:03:37,479
All right, so our two perps
escaped in a what?

85
00:03:37,571 --> 00:03:39,322
- Black Ford van. Morning.
- Yeah.

86
00:03:39,407 --> 00:03:41,799
This is bodega footage two
blocks from the crime scene.

87
00:03:41,893 --> 00:03:43,964
Front wheel does match
the witness description.

88
00:03:44,049 --> 00:03:47,229
We were able to track them
for a dozen blocks or so,

89
00:03:47,337 --> 00:03:48,488
then we lose them.

90
00:03:48,573 --> 00:03:49,991
Get any quality shots
of the perps?

91
00:03:50,076 --> 00:03:51,843
Uh, there's not enough
for facial rec,

92
00:03:51,928 --> 00:03:54,480
but the biometrics can
confirm heights on both

93
00:03:54,581 --> 00:03:55,932
the driver and the passenger.

94
00:03:56,016 --> 00:03:58,447
Based on make and model,
driver is 6'1",

95
00:03:58,532 --> 00:04:01,238
and riding literal shotgun
is a 5'7" individual.

96
00:04:01,323 --> 00:04:03,708
Okay, so that all jibes
with the eyewitness statement,

97
00:04:03,824 --> 00:04:05,807
plus the passenger is smoking
with his left hand.

98
00:04:05,892 --> 00:04:07,045
It looks like they obscured
the license plate, yeah?

99
00:04:07,129 --> 00:04:08,299
That's correct.

100
00:04:08,384 --> 00:04:09,855
All right, let's put
a BOLO out on the van

101
00:04:09,939 --> 00:04:13,425
and let's flip to our victim,
Mr. Frank Leone.

102
00:04:13,605 --> 00:04:15,490
So who was he?
Why was he killed?

103
00:04:15,575 --> 00:04:16,510
Hobbs, talk to me.
What do we know?

104
00:04:16,595 --> 00:04:19,268
He was an accountant,
25 years at Ernst and Young.

105
00:04:19,353 --> 00:04:21,872
Went on his own five years ago,
and look at this:

106
00:04:22,076 --> 00:04:24,158
He was liquidating his assets
a week ago,

107
00:04:24,245 --> 00:04:25,783
moving everything into cash.

108
00:04:25,868 --> 00:04:27,065
And so was his wife.

109
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:29,244
Well, maybe they're
bearish on the stock market.

110
00:04:30,424 --> 00:04:31,565
Or something else.

111
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:35,026
Ivy League, MBA, Lions Club.

112
00:04:35,596 --> 00:04:37,507
Let's be honest, solid citizens

113
00:04:37,591 --> 00:04:38,753
don't get rubbed out
on city streets.

114
00:04:38,837 --> 00:04:39,924
We need more.

115
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:42,409
Does he have any enemies,
any debts he won't pay?

116
00:04:42,494 --> 00:04:44,955
I mean, this could be anything,
a love triangle gone bad.

117
00:04:45,065 --> 00:04:46,722
Don't make me use
my imagination, folks.

118
00:04:46,807 --> 00:04:47,854
I need facts.

119
00:04:47,939 --> 00:04:49,474
Has anyone
contacted the widow?

120
00:04:49,559 --> 00:04:51,662
Uh, yeah, OA and Nina
just landed in Forest Hills.

121
00:04:51,747 --> 00:04:53,830
So hopefully Mrs. Leone
can enlighten us.

122
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:58,308
I don't know.

123
00:04:58,393 --> 00:05:00,760
Really. He never says much.

124
00:05:01,494 --> 00:05:03,156
Said much.

125
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:07,093
I mean, he works,
and I do the kids.

126
00:05:07,177 --> 00:05:09,395
So I can't really help much.
I just... I can't.

127
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:12,032
But Miss Leone, your husband
was murdered today.

128
00:05:12,116 --> 00:05:14,801
And you're being a bit
evasive with us.

129
00:05:14,885 --> 00:05:16,702
Was there something going on
between the two of you?

130
00:05:16,786 --> 00:05:18,571
Did he have somebody else?
Did you...

131
00:05:18,655 --> 00:05:21,407
What? Me? Us?
No, nothing like that.

132
00:05:21,491 --> 00:05:23,343
Well, we know that
you sold your house recently

133
00:05:23,427 --> 00:05:25,377
and that you've been
transferring lots of cash

134
00:05:25,479 --> 00:05:26,770
to your various
different bank accounts.

135
00:05:26,854 --> 00:05:29,323
What, with this market,
we need a reason

136
00:05:29,408 --> 00:05:30,800
to make a move towards cash?

137
00:05:30,885 --> 00:05:32,143
Is that a crime?

138
00:05:33,887 --> 00:05:35,104
Hawaii?

139
00:05:35,236 --> 00:05:36,322
Yes.

140
00:05:36,908 --> 00:05:39,400
For our tenth, we swam
with the dolphins.

141
00:05:39,682 --> 00:05:40,854
It's a beautiful family.

142
00:05:40,939 --> 00:05:43,378
Thank you.
He loves his girls.

143
00:05:43,463 --> 00:05:46,566
We think that this was a
targeted shooting, Miss Leone.

144
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:48,268
So anything that
you can tell us

145
00:05:48,352 --> 00:05:50,776
about his personal life
or his work life,

146
00:05:50,861 --> 00:05:53,175
all of it would be really,
really helpful.

147
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:55,494
I honestly don't know.

148
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:57,343
He had only one client.

149
00:05:57,427 --> 00:05:59,729
He would allude to stuff
about his client

150
00:05:59,814 --> 00:06:01,151
but never spell anything out.

151
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:03,047
Never even told me his name.

152
00:06:03,132 --> 00:06:04,167
What kind of stuff?

153
00:06:08,563 --> 00:06:10,522
If you are scared, Miss Leone,
that's okay

154
00:06:10,607 --> 00:06:12,324
'cause we can protect you
and we can protect them.

155
00:06:12,408 --> 00:06:13,459
But you're gonna
have to help us here,

156
00:06:13,543 --> 00:06:15,779
and you're gonna have
to do that right now.

157
00:06:18,215 --> 00:06:19,565
It might have been,
and I swear

158
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:23,308
that I am guessing, drugs.

159
00:06:23,393 --> 00:06:26,106
Frank said he was not doing
anything illegal himself,

160
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:30,243
and he had this five-year plan,
and then we'd be set for life.

161
00:06:30,327 --> 00:06:32,619
And that's why
we were cashing in.

162
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:37,596
There's gonna be some really
rough times ahead

163
00:06:37,704 --> 00:06:39,556
for you, for them.

164
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,054
So knowing who
did this and why,

165
00:06:41,138 --> 00:06:42,846
that's gonna be
really important,

166
00:06:44,193 --> 00:06:45,900
especially for the girls.

167
00:06:53,984 --> 00:06:54,984
Hold on.

168
00:07:12,569 --> 00:07:16,640
He told me if anything happens,
this has everything.

169
00:07:23,179 --> 00:07:25,497
All right, we figured out
who the mystery client is

170
00:07:25,582 --> 00:07:27,567
and if he in fact
killed his money man?

171
00:07:27,651 --> 00:07:29,683
Well, Leone's only client
is more like

172
00:07:29,768 --> 00:07:31,276
a one-man conglomerate.

173
00:07:31,361 --> 00:07:34,667
There are over 30 LLCs,
all set up offshore.

174
00:07:34,752 --> 00:07:36,542
Caymans, Belize, Isle of Man.

175
00:07:36,626 --> 00:07:38,411
Kind of instruments designed
to move and launder

176
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:40,564
lots of cash without a trace.

177
00:07:40,682 --> 00:07:43,050
So I'm cross-referencing
any of the accounts

178
00:07:43,135 --> 00:07:44,675
with all the
brick-and-mortar overlays,

179
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,457
and there's at least a dozen
buildings in Toronto

180
00:07:47,542 --> 00:07:50,261
owned by a single trust
assigned to one of the LLCs,

181
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:54,932
and a Maria Rincon is listed
as president of that trust.

182
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:57,580
And she happens to be the
wife of Antonio Rincon.

183
00:07:58,335 --> 00:08:03,789
Who is, wow, a major player.

184
00:08:03,991 --> 00:08:05,776
Did some state time
for distribution,

185
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,745
had several arrests
for homicide

186
00:08:07,829 --> 00:08:09,689
but strangely, no convictions.

187
00:08:09,831 --> 00:08:12,283
Deep into narcotics,
runs high level robbery crews,

188
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:16,393
and sine qua non for gangsters
everywhere, murder for hire.

189
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:18,589
Widely known as El Feo.

190
00:08:18,674 --> 00:08:21,783
All right, so our victim
was working for this El Feo,

191
00:08:21,976 --> 00:08:24,262
an old school gangster
in a brave new world,

192
00:08:24,369 --> 00:08:28,131
which means Client One
just became Target One.

193
00:08:28,215 --> 00:08:30,713
Lookie here,
he's been tagged by the DOJ.

194
00:08:30,951 --> 00:08:33,346
A secret grand jury
was convened

195
00:08:33,431 --> 00:08:35,541
three months ago
to go after him.

196
00:08:35,735 --> 00:08:38,213
Was Leone also a target
of the investigation?

197
00:08:38,298 --> 00:08:40,314
I can't tell. It's weird.

198
00:08:40,428 --> 00:08:42,111
Most of this is redacted.

199
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:45,032
Leone may have
been testifying.

200
00:08:46,968 --> 00:08:49,337
All right, I'll go talk
to the U.S. Attorney.

201
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:55,938
All I can say for sure,
our case died with Leone.

202
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:58,564
- Did he flip on El Feo?
- Gave us everything.

203
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:01,345
But more importantly,
he was willing to testify.

204
00:09:01,516 --> 00:09:04,201
We were less than a week away
from indicting that prick.

205
00:09:04,285 --> 00:09:07,135
And somehow El Feo
found out about the betrayal.

206
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,437
I'm not sure.

207
00:09:08,605 --> 00:09:10,256
This jury was
locked super tight.

208
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,591
Strictly need to know.

209
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:13,294
Only prosecutors
and the jurors.

210
00:09:13,379 --> 00:09:14,662
Leone didn't even
have a lawyer,

211
00:09:14,747 --> 00:09:16,899
and I know for a fact
he never told his wife.

212
00:09:16,984 --> 00:09:18,002
All right.

213
00:09:18,087 --> 00:09:20,149
First thing, I need a list
of those grand jurors.

214
00:09:20,234 --> 00:09:22,463
- We need to find that leak.
- Done.

215
00:09:23,477 --> 00:09:26,174
You know, Izzy,
Leone was a good guy,

216
00:09:26,276 --> 00:09:28,144
just got himself stuck
at the intersection

217
00:09:28,229 --> 00:09:29,841
of greed and stupidity.

218
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,386
All right, folks,
any of our esteemed jurors

219
00:09:35,471 --> 00:09:37,250
have any connections
to El Feo, to his gang,

220
00:09:37,335 --> 00:09:38,819
to any known associates?

221
00:09:38,904 --> 00:09:41,723
Any of those jurors have
any irregular influxes of cash?

222
00:09:41,939 --> 00:09:43,324
Any major purchases?

223
00:09:43,523 --> 00:09:46,344
Well, we got everyone
from a tech start up CEO

224
00:09:46,428 --> 00:09:48,346
to a USPS letter carrier,

225
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:51,715
but there's only one juror
so far that jumps out,

226
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:53,476
a Mrs. Saunders.

227
00:09:53,628 --> 00:09:55,346
Margaret Saunders.

228
00:09:55,734 --> 00:09:58,625
On a medical assistant salary,
she made two deposits

229
00:09:58,812 --> 00:10:00,824
over the past week of $9,000.

230
00:10:00,908 --> 00:10:03,468
That's conveniently under
the federal reporting trigger.

231
00:10:03,574 --> 00:10:07,560
Well, she hit it big at the
slots or Saturday night bingo?

232
00:10:07,715 --> 00:10:09,484
Or maybe she's El Feo's source.

233
00:10:09,664 --> 00:10:11,435
If that is the case,
how would she and El Feo

234
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,507
have found each other?

235
00:10:12,592 --> 00:10:15,212
She's a middle class mom.
He's a depraved killer.

236
00:10:15,297 --> 00:10:16,391
I think I have something.

237
00:10:16,476 --> 00:10:18,240
She works for a dermatologist
in Midtown.

238
00:10:18,325 --> 00:10:19,643
Yeah.

239
00:10:19,727 --> 00:10:20,978
El Feo is a patient there.

240
00:10:21,062 --> 00:10:23,781
All right, there it is.
Guilt by association.

241
00:10:23,865 --> 00:10:25,716
It's like I always say,
never trust

242
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,485
your dermatologist's assistant.

243
00:10:27,569 --> 00:10:29,953
So how do we find this
Mrs. Margaret Saunders?

244
00:10:30,037 --> 00:10:32,856
She's in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn.

245
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:35,393
All right, Tiffany
and Scola are closest.

246
00:10:35,477 --> 00:10:38,164
Let's go ask her
about this sudden windfall.

247
00:10:46,552 --> 00:10:49,721
Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Saunders?

248
00:11:04,939 --> 00:11:07,074
Miss Saunders?

249
00:11:11,613 --> 00:11:13,226
Miss Saunders?

250
00:11:33,635 --> 00:11:37,087
So they did the husband quick
and the wife slow?

251
00:11:37,171 --> 00:11:38,822
They wanted to know
if she told anyone about

252
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:40,758
her side hustle with El Feo.

253
00:11:49,648 --> 00:11:51,094
Hey.
Ballistics are a match.

254
00:11:51,179 --> 00:11:52,923
The kill shot on Leone
is from the same gun

255
00:11:53,008 --> 00:11:54,259
that killed the Saunders.

256
00:11:54,343 --> 00:11:56,728
Killing Leone
was a no-brainer for El Feo.

257
00:11:56,835 --> 00:11:58,830
And the minute
Leone was dead,

258
00:11:58,914 --> 00:12:01,266
Mrs. Saunders became a threat
that had to be eliminated.

259
00:12:01,351 --> 00:12:03,415
Right, so El Feo
pays Saunders to be a mole,

260
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,271
then he tortures and kills her
and her husband.

261
00:12:06,355 --> 00:12:08,073
Question is,
how do we bring him down?

262
00:12:08,157 --> 00:12:10,077
As far as I can tell,
we don't have any evidence.

263
00:12:13,295 --> 00:12:15,742
I worked with a cop
who was cousins with El Feo.

264
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:19,184
I... I can reach out to him.

265
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,035
He might be a way in for us.

266
00:12:23,645 --> 00:12:25,960
Do you really think he'd
help us against a relative?

267
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:27,711
He contacted me
a few weeks back.

268
00:12:27,796 --> 00:12:30,161
He got pinched with an
unregistered firearm.

269
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:33,164
He said he needed some help,
so he might be worth a shot.

270
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:35,667
Okay.

271
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:38,536
Feel him out. The mayor.

272
00:12:38,811 --> 00:12:40,202
Your Honor.

273
00:12:40,823 --> 00:12:42,359
All right, Hobbs,
what do you got?

274
00:12:42,444 --> 00:12:43,876
We just found the kill car
in the Bronx.

275
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,877
- We found the black van.
- All right.

276
00:12:46,061 --> 00:12:49,021
I'm checking with the NYPD
ARGUS camera on that block.

277
00:12:51,082 --> 00:12:52,600
- There's our two shooters.
- Yeah.

278
00:12:52,719 --> 00:12:54,620
Please tell me you have a
good enough angle to ID them?

279
00:12:54,704 --> 00:12:57,539
Uh, not enough
for our lefty shooter, but...

280
00:13:00,776 --> 00:13:03,897
Yeah, there you go,
Marcus Thierre.

281
00:13:04,769 --> 00:13:06,854
Okay.
Tell me about Marcus Thierre.

282
00:13:07,016 --> 00:13:09,600
Ex-con, just released
after serving time

283
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:12,100
for armed robbery,
and he's 6'1".

284
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,472
Looks like he has
five more months to go

285
00:13:14,556 --> 00:13:16,041
at a halfway house...
Williamsburg.

286
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:17,658
Okay, great,
you guys head over there

287
00:13:17,743 --> 00:13:19,405
and talk to him,
I'll shoot you the deets.

288
00:13:24,266 --> 00:13:25,450
Marcus?

289
00:13:25,534 --> 00:13:27,118
Guy's solid.

290
00:13:27,202 --> 00:13:28,780
Keeps to himself, mostly.

291
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,414
- We need to pick him up.
- Yeah.

292
00:13:30,499 --> 00:13:32,624
For all the times he
didn't keep to himself.

293
00:13:32,808 --> 00:13:33,992
Can you call him?

294
00:13:34,077 --> 00:13:35,661
Tell him you're
bringing up a package?

295
00:13:47,021 --> 00:13:48,796
Marcus.

296
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:50,092
FBI!

297
00:14:26,428 --> 00:14:28,513
- Get back!
- He's got a gun!

298
00:14:28,597 --> 00:14:30,015
Get down. Get down.

299
00:14:30,099 --> 00:14:31,467
Stay there!

300
00:14:36,772 --> 00:14:38,523
Suspect is running
out of the park.

301
00:14:38,607 --> 00:14:41,143
Shots fired, shots fired.

302
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,510
We got eyes on him.

303
00:14:55,891 --> 00:14:57,827
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey, man!

304
00:15:05,367 --> 00:15:06,317
He's gone.

305
00:15:06,401 --> 00:15:07,518
Hey.

306
00:15:07,602 --> 00:15:08,820
We heard shots.
Are you guys okay?

307
00:15:08,904 --> 00:15:10,355
Yeah. We're good.

308
00:15:10,439 --> 00:15:11,823
Okay.

309
00:15:11,907 --> 00:15:14,225
Let's work with NYPD
on containment, okay?

310
00:15:14,342 --> 00:15:15,342
Yeah.

311
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:20,031
Hey, Jubal,
any luck on your end?

312
00:15:20,115 --> 00:15:22,033
No, not yet, but containment
is being activated.

313
00:15:22,117 --> 00:15:23,534
We put out a BOLO, and we're up

314
00:15:23,618 --> 00:15:25,270
on every camera
in the vicinity.

315
00:15:25,354 --> 00:15:26,637
<i>So I'll let you know
when we get a hit.</i>

316
00:15:26,721 --> 00:15:28,306
Okay.

317
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:31,810
Hey, my cop friend, Ralphie,
wants to talk.

318
00:15:31,894 --> 00:15:33,144
- That's great news.
- Yeah.

319
00:15:33,228 --> 00:15:34,864
Let's pay him a visit.

320
00:15:37,566 --> 00:15:39,268
A hardware store?

321
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:43,654
Thought you said
this guy was a cop.

322
00:15:43,738 --> 00:15:45,090
He was.

323
00:15:45,174 --> 00:15:48,626
He... um, he got flopped
while he was on probation.

324
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:50,361
They're always trying to make
an example out of somebody.

325
00:15:50,445 --> 00:15:51,562
He just had bad luck.

326
00:15:51,646 --> 00:15:53,298
NYPD and its lingua franca.

327
00:15:53,382 --> 00:15:56,716
Flopped, makes it sound like
there's a comedy involved.

328
00:15:57,194 --> 00:16:00,139
There's nothing funny
about losing your dream job.

329
00:16:00,507 --> 00:16:04,060
Look, Stuart, he's a good guy.

330
00:16:04,145 --> 00:16:06,513
He's just had it rough
the past few years.

331
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:09,815
His brother overdosed
on drugs a few years back,

332
00:16:09,899 --> 00:16:11,599
and they were really close,
so he kind of

333
00:16:11,684 --> 00:16:13,051
spiraled out after that.

334
00:16:13,135 --> 00:16:15,099
Started taking a lot of risks,
acting crazy.

335
00:16:15,184 --> 00:16:17,982
But he's back on his feet now.

336
00:16:18,067 --> 00:16:21,076
And he got this business
from his dad after he passed.

337
00:16:24,744 --> 00:16:26,429
Yeah, you're a lucky man, Stuart.

338
00:16:26,514 --> 00:16:28,178
Yeah, Tiff's not gonna
say it out loud,

339
00:16:28,263 --> 00:16:30,936
but she was first in our class
over at the academy.

340
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,778
Even won company sharpshooter.

341
00:16:32,863 --> 00:16:34,981
All right.
That's enough butt kissing.

342
00:16:35,066 --> 00:16:37,017
I mean,
she's modest to a fault.

343
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:38,955
Enough.

344
00:16:39,062 --> 00:16:40,579
Okay.

345
00:16:40,695 --> 00:16:42,684
Let's talk about
something else.

346
00:16:43,192 --> 00:16:45,616
Like my cousin El Feo.

347
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,185
Primo supremo.

348
00:16:47,269 --> 00:16:48,519
You still see him?

349
00:16:48,603 --> 00:16:51,356
Yeah, he's always after me,
man, you know?

350
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:54,084
Wants me to come use my skills,
do B&E jobs,

351
00:16:54,169 --> 00:16:56,161
promises me riches.

352
00:16:56,245 --> 00:16:59,164
Like, I wanna work for a guy
who kills half his employees.

353
00:16:59,248 --> 00:17:00,916
You talk lately?

354
00:17:05,255 --> 00:17:06,840
Yeah, El Feo
reached out last week,

355
00:17:06,956 --> 00:17:08,874
invited me over to his place.

356
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:10,942
Likes to show off his mansion.

357
00:17:11,026 --> 00:17:12,878
He's moving on up, you know?

358
00:17:12,962 --> 00:17:15,221
Well, if you wanna help us
take him down,

359
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:18,714
plant a wire, get him talking,
maybe that gun charge...

360
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,986
Wait, wait, wait, you said
you can't help with that.

361
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:22,511
You said that's a State beef.

362
00:17:22,596 --> 00:17:23,889
No, no, no,
what I said was that I...

363
00:17:23,973 --> 00:17:25,924
And can you believe that
that rat fink prosecutor

364
00:17:26,008 --> 00:17:28,106
telling me that I deserve
to go away for a year and a day

365
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:30,361
like I'm some mutt
off the street?

366
00:17:30,445 --> 00:17:32,330
No, but that animal, El Feo,

367
00:17:32,414 --> 00:17:37,035
he kills people for fun,
he gets a mansion, fancy cars.

368
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:39,737
And you know just as well
as I do that that scumbag,

369
00:17:39,821 --> 00:17:41,039
he killed my brother Michael.

370
00:17:41,123 --> 00:17:42,268
No, no, no,
we don't know that.

371
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:43,902
Yeah, I do know that!

372
00:17:43,987 --> 00:17:45,831
And that's a fact, Tiff!

373
00:17:46,228 --> 00:17:48,299
Tiff, he running
this neighborhood.

374
00:17:48,497 --> 00:17:50,748
Who you think supplying
all the heroin here?

375
00:17:50,832 --> 00:17:52,117
Come on.

376
00:17:52,253 --> 00:17:54,237
And if it's cut with fentanyl,
guess what?

377
00:17:54,322 --> 00:17:55,339
It's because of him.

378
00:17:55,495 --> 00:17:56,918
He's telling his people
to do it.

379
00:17:57,003 --> 00:17:58,388
Okay, look,

380
00:17:58,473 --> 00:18:01,065
maybe you should just use this
as motivation to take him down.

381
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:10,028
So we good?

382
00:18:10,152 --> 00:18:11,448
You in?

383
00:18:12,121 --> 00:18:14,214
<i>Hey, anybody back there?</i>

384
00:18:15,091 --> 00:18:16,534
Ralphie, you in?

385
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,711
Yeah. I'm in.

386
00:18:20,795 --> 00:18:22,370
For pleasure.

387
00:18:22,751 --> 00:18:25,436
- Okay.
- Yeah? All right.

388
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:28,137
I got you. I'm your man.

389
00:18:29,985 --> 00:18:31,954
- I gotta get back to work.
- Yeah.

390
00:18:36,045 --> 00:18:37,862
I don't know about this, Tiff.

391
00:18:39,698 --> 00:18:41,933
That's a lot of anger he's got
towards his cousin.

392
00:18:42,017 --> 00:18:44,469
No, he can do it.
He's just, um...

393
00:18:44,701 --> 00:18:46,269
Unhinged?

394
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:52,494
He just wears his heart
on his sleeve.

395
00:18:53,323 --> 00:18:54,445
Look, he's a good guy,

396
00:18:54,529 --> 00:18:55,813
and he deserves
a second chance,

397
00:18:55,897 --> 00:18:58,933
so I'd really appreciate
your support on this.

398
00:19:02,771 --> 00:19:04,322
Yeah.

399
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:13,555
Did he really lose his badge
for public intoxication?

400
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,925
He was on probation.
One strike, you're out.

401
00:19:16,009 --> 00:19:18,155
But you think he's solid?
Dependable?

402
00:19:18,278 --> 00:19:19,462
I do.

403
00:19:19,709 --> 00:19:21,159
And you?

404
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:22,644
You met him?

405
00:19:22,729 --> 00:19:23,746
Uh, yeah.

406
00:19:23,831 --> 00:19:25,082
Good guy.

407
00:19:25,167 --> 00:19:26,869
I think it's worth a shot.

408
00:19:28,522 --> 00:19:30,840
Okay, good.

409
00:19:30,924 --> 00:19:32,375
If he helps us out,
the Brooklyn DA's

410
00:19:32,459 --> 00:19:33,827
willing to drop his case.

411
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:40,679
Okay. Thank you.

412
00:19:40,764 --> 00:19:42,452
We can get this.

413
00:19:42,693 --> 00:19:46,615
Okay, Ralphie,
this camera sees all.

414
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:47,857
Okay.

415
00:19:47,941 --> 00:19:50,560
This earpiece just slides in.

416
00:19:50,644 --> 00:19:52,155
Keeps us
in constant communication.

417
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,263
No one will be able
to hear us except for you.

418
00:19:53,347 --> 00:19:54,364
Gotcha.

419
00:19:54,448 --> 00:19:56,966
This belt holds
two camera bugs.

420
00:19:57,068 --> 00:19:58,734
Just slide them out when
you're ready to deploy.

421
00:19:58,818 --> 00:20:01,229
- Easy enough.
- Mm-hmm.

422
00:20:01,741 --> 00:20:04,211
You guys got some real
James Bond gack going on here.

423
00:20:07,193 --> 00:20:08,911
So you know El Feo,
you know how he operates.

424
00:20:08,995 --> 00:20:10,280
Sure.

425
00:20:10,364 --> 00:20:11,947
So how do we get
the most bang for our buck?

426
00:20:12,031 --> 00:20:13,649
Yeah, he holds court
in his kitchen.

427
00:20:13,733 --> 00:20:15,151
He does his one-on-ones
up in his office

428
00:20:15,235 --> 00:20:17,187
like he's the pope holding
audiences or something.

429
00:20:17,271 --> 00:20:18,321
Okay. That's good.

430
00:20:18,405 --> 00:20:19,855
We just need information
about El Feo

431
00:20:19,939 --> 00:20:21,591
that ties him to the Leone
and Saunders murders.

432
00:20:21,675 --> 00:20:23,058
I got you.

433
00:20:23,142 --> 00:20:24,627
We also know that
he uses a burner.

434
00:20:24,711 --> 00:20:26,162
All right, we're gonna
need you to clone it.

435
00:20:26,246 --> 00:20:28,964
This is plug and play.
This phone into the burner.

436
00:20:29,048 --> 00:20:31,667
Got it. Yep.

437
00:20:31,751 --> 00:20:33,503
We're gonna be with you
the whole time, okay?

438
00:20:33,587 --> 00:20:36,272
Remember, though,
nothing obvious.

439
00:20:36,356 --> 00:20:37,473
Chitchat like always.

440
00:20:37,587 --> 00:20:39,022
Tiff, I got this.

441
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,898
Just happy to be
back in the game.

442
00:20:52,806 --> 00:20:54,056
All right,
let's go live on pole cam.

443
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:56,438
All right, let's hope
this dude is solid.

444
00:20:56,523 --> 00:20:57,660
What does that mean?

445
00:20:57,922 --> 00:21:00,612
He's a failed cop,
hoping for his day in the sun,

446
00:21:00,697 --> 00:21:03,633
and we're sending him
into the dragon's lair.

447
00:21:08,588 --> 00:21:10,590
Just give him a chance.

448
00:21:16,644 --> 00:21:17,968
<i>Hands out.</i>

449
00:21:18,053 --> 00:21:19,170
<i>Really?</i>

450
00:21:19,357 --> 00:21:20,616
Gonna make you
frisk his own cousin now?

451
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,802
Man, he has us
frisk his own momma.

452
00:21:30,822 --> 00:21:32,940
Yo, yo.
Up against the wall, gangsters.

453
00:21:33,079 --> 00:21:35,231
- This is a raid.
- Funny guy.

454
00:21:40,787 --> 00:21:42,071
That guy
in the blue shirt,

455
00:21:42,155 --> 00:21:43,873
that's Junior Ruiz,
known associate

456
00:21:43,957 --> 00:21:45,575
of our other shooter,
Marcus Thierre.

457
00:21:45,659 --> 00:21:47,383
Also a 5'7" lefty.

458
00:21:48,477 --> 00:21:50,162
See? Ralphie's already
helping us out.

459
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,624
<i>You finally made it.</i>

460
00:21:51,865 --> 00:21:53,716
<i>You always telling me
I should drop by,</i>

461
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,101
<i>so here I am.</i>

462
00:21:57,203 --> 00:22:00,956
Ey, yo, cuz, for real, what you
doing blasting off in the hood

463
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,693
during my nap time?

464
00:22:03,777 --> 00:22:06,429
So much for
run-of-the-mill chitchat.

465
00:22:06,513 --> 00:22:10,333
You seriously can't
afford silencers now?

466
00:22:10,417 --> 00:22:12,201
What is he doing?

467
00:22:12,285 --> 00:22:14,203
Ralphie, knock it off.

468
00:22:14,287 --> 00:22:15,505
I heard about that
tragedy that happened

469
00:22:15,589 --> 00:22:16,589
in the old neighborhood.

470
00:22:16,824 --> 00:22:18,445
Makes me sad.

471
00:22:18,725 --> 00:22:21,010
But with violence
like that, Charlie,

472
00:22:21,094 --> 00:22:23,078
how can people still wonder
why I left Brooklyn?

473
00:22:28,201 --> 00:22:29,903
It's a beautiful picture
of Abuelita.

474
00:22:33,271 --> 00:22:34,589
My abuelita.

475
00:22:34,674 --> 00:22:35,658
You know she hated your

476
00:22:35,742 --> 00:22:37,092
drug-dealing ass,
though, right?

477
00:22:37,176 --> 00:22:39,599
Yeah, but she loved the
big-ass house I bought her.

478
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,404
Abuelita.

479
00:22:47,256 --> 00:22:48,339
Yeah.

480
00:22:48,424 --> 00:22:50,490
So you want to come
work for me?

481
00:22:51,991 --> 00:22:53,513
I gotta ask, primo.

482
00:22:58,098 --> 00:22:59,316
Why now?

483
00:22:59,493 --> 00:23:00,844
Tell him you wanna
buy out your building.

484
00:23:00,928 --> 00:23:02,808
You're tired of your
landlord raising your rent.

485
00:23:04,278 --> 00:23:06,263
'Cause, man...

486
00:23:07,091 --> 00:23:09,257
Hey, look, you know
what my business has become.

487
00:23:09,342 --> 00:23:11,327
I got old people
losing their keys.

488
00:23:11,411 --> 00:23:13,796
I got to go let 'em in.
I don't even wanna charge 'em.

489
00:23:13,927 --> 00:23:16,193
I didn't ask you what
was wrong with your life.

490
00:23:16,278 --> 00:23:17,795
I asked you why now.

491
00:23:18,019 --> 00:23:21,068
Why now I'm suddenly not
so horrible to work for?

492
00:23:22,084 --> 00:23:23,569
It's simple.

493
00:23:23,755 --> 00:23:26,206
'Cause I got to get mine.

494
00:23:26,392 --> 00:23:27,643
I'm tired of playing
by the rules

495
00:23:27,727 --> 00:23:29,479
and living like a peasant.

496
00:23:29,563 --> 00:23:30,897
That's the truth.

497
00:23:32,471 --> 00:23:33,848
I don't buy it, Ralphie boy.

498
00:23:34,026 --> 00:23:35,751
Hey, look.

499
00:23:35,835 --> 00:23:37,987
I can open any safe
that they make.

500
00:23:38,071 --> 00:23:39,589
And outside of the
military-grade stuff,

501
00:23:39,673 --> 00:23:41,323
I can get around
any alarm system.

502
00:23:41,407 --> 00:23:42,592
You hear this guy?

503
00:23:42,676 --> 00:23:45,433
All the sudden, he wants
to be a master criminal?

504
00:23:46,339 --> 00:23:48,458
Once a cop, always a cop.

505
00:23:48,582 --> 00:23:50,815
- We need to pull him.
- No. Just give him a chance.

506
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:53,651
Tiff, you're gonna get
your friend here killed.

507
00:23:54,298 --> 00:23:57,284
I was a cop for six months,
ten years ago, dummy.

508
00:23:57,781 --> 00:23:59,038
And they flopped my ass.

509
00:23:59,159 --> 00:24:00,300
Man, what...

510
00:24:03,627 --> 00:24:05,044
Okay, you know what? Ey, fine.

511
00:24:05,129 --> 00:24:06,824
Fine. All right.

512
00:24:06,909 --> 00:24:10,011
I'll take my skills and my
infectious charm elsewhere.

513
00:24:10,167 --> 00:24:12,221
I got a bunch of major
scores mapped out too.

514
00:24:12,305 --> 00:24:13,423
You know, if you're
not smart enough to get

515
00:24:13,507 --> 00:24:16,284
- on the train, hell, man...
- Ralphie, relax.

516
00:24:16,604 --> 00:24:17,938
I'm interested.

517
00:24:20,213 --> 00:24:22,732
So you keep talking and maybe
we'll find something

518
00:24:22,816 --> 00:24:24,383
that both of us
can do together.

519
00:24:28,397 --> 00:24:30,433
Sounds good to me, cuz.

520
00:24:31,621 --> 00:24:33,183
Thank you.

521
00:24:35,028 --> 00:24:36,211
It's time to go to bathroom.

522
00:24:36,295 --> 00:24:38,031
You mind if I hit the head?

523
00:24:41,835 --> 00:24:43,036
Don't be so serious.

524
00:24:45,805 --> 00:24:47,723
Trust me, if I
didn't bust his chops,

525
00:24:47,807 --> 00:24:49,324
he'd know I was wired for sure.

526
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:50,460
All right. Got it.

527
00:24:50,544 --> 00:24:51,544
<i>Where's the office?</i>

528
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,598
Well, don't worry.

529
00:24:55,682 --> 00:24:57,433
I got mad lock picking skills.

530
00:25:11,264 --> 00:25:12,448
Wait, wait. Right there.

531
00:25:12,532 --> 00:25:14,934
Right between the window
and the shelf.

532
00:25:21,541 --> 00:25:22,792
All right.

533
00:25:22,876 --> 00:25:24,544
Now where's the phone?

534
00:25:40,594 --> 00:25:42,377
Bingo.

535
00:25:42,461 --> 00:25:44,013
Cool. Simple.

536
00:25:44,097 --> 00:25:45,431
Plug it into the cloning phone.

537
00:25:47,801 --> 00:25:48,784
Hey, hey.

538
00:25:48,868 --> 00:25:52,788
Where's Ruiz?

539
00:25:52,872 --> 00:25:54,657
Hey, hey. Lock that door.

540
00:25:54,741 --> 00:25:56,325
I need just a second.

541
00:25:56,409 --> 00:25:58,695
No, you need to lock it now.

542
00:26:01,147 --> 00:26:02,481
<i>Lock it now.</i>

543
00:26:11,725 --> 00:26:13,075
Ralphie, don't move.

544
00:26:31,077 --> 00:26:33,012
All right, you're good. Go.

545
00:26:49,648 --> 00:26:51,614
Hey. Nice job.

546
00:26:51,775 --> 00:26:53,570
Here you go.

547
00:26:54,957 --> 00:26:56,792
You good?

548
00:26:58,735 --> 00:26:59,870
I'm good.

549
00:27:03,242 --> 00:27:05,294
Ralphie. What's up?

550
00:27:08,171 --> 00:27:10,369
These guys in here
joking about it.

551
00:27:10,508 --> 00:27:13,390
Living like...
Living like movie stars.

552
00:27:14,201 --> 00:27:16,119
I know who they are, Tiff.

553
00:27:16,398 --> 00:27:17,966
I know what they do.

554
00:27:19,358 --> 00:27:20,843
Know who they kill.

555
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:22,745
Makes me sick.

556
00:27:22,829 --> 00:27:25,047
Yeah, well, because of you,

557
00:27:25,131 --> 00:27:26,749
we're a lot closer
to taking him down.

558
00:27:26,833 --> 00:27:29,318
Just feel like
I need a shower.

559
00:27:29,402 --> 00:27:31,938
Just being next to that man.

560
00:27:33,639 --> 00:27:35,290
And this prick,

561
00:27:35,374 --> 00:27:37,392
this prick asked me if I wanted
to go fishing with him.

562
00:27:37,476 --> 00:27:39,662
You believe that?

563
00:27:39,746 --> 00:27:41,130
He's dropping bodies
all over the city,

564
00:27:41,214 --> 00:27:43,282
but yeah, sure, let's go snag
some striped bass.

565
00:27:45,384 --> 00:27:47,737
Like I got nothing better to
do than hang out with a killer.

566
00:27:47,821 --> 00:27:50,640
Well, the good news is,
because you did your job,

567
00:27:50,724 --> 00:27:52,007
I can help you
with your gun case.

568
00:27:52,091 --> 00:27:54,352
And that we're gonna nail
El Feo, all right?

569
00:27:54,479 --> 00:27:57,415
He's gonna pay for all the pain
and suffering he caused.

570
00:27:59,699 --> 00:28:01,534
Silver lining, huh?

571
00:28:05,004 --> 00:28:06,889
It ain't much,
but it's something.

572
00:28:07,144 --> 00:28:09,146
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

573
00:28:09,966 --> 00:28:11,951
We'll be in touch.

574
00:28:12,278 --> 00:28:13,495
Yeah.

575
00:28:13,711 --> 00:28:15,126
All right. Thank you.

576
00:28:23,622 --> 00:28:25,619
See? I told you he's good.

577
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:28,143
- We got what we needed.
- No, Tiff.

578
00:28:28,227 --> 00:28:30,379
We just got really lucky.

579
00:28:34,801 --> 00:28:36,652
Let's see the fruits
of the cloned phone.

580
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:38,587
El Feo's burner only called
one other phone

581
00:28:38,671 --> 00:28:40,089
when the murders
were going down,

582
00:28:40,173 --> 00:28:42,557
and that same phone was
at the scene of both killings.

583
00:28:42,641 --> 00:28:43,993
Where is that
phone right now?

584
00:28:44,077 --> 00:28:46,495
It is on and pinging
off a cell tower in Yonkers.

585
00:28:46,579 --> 00:28:47,797
Narrowing it down.

586
00:28:47,881 --> 00:28:49,198
Gonna take a wild guess
and say we're about

587
00:28:49,282 --> 00:28:51,066
to reconnect
with Marcus Thierre.

588
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:53,502
Okay, that phone was
at an address, 264 Garnet,

589
00:28:53,586 --> 00:28:54,904
for the last hour and a half.

590
00:28:54,988 --> 00:29:00,042
And it is now just down
the street from there.

591
00:29:00,126 --> 00:29:02,328
Our friends in the Yonkers PD
have cameras on that block?

592
00:29:02,412 --> 00:29:03,695
Uh, none of their city cams,

593
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:05,414
but the PD up there
has an agreement

594
00:29:05,499 --> 00:29:06,783
with commercial properties.

595
00:29:06,867 --> 00:29:08,552
I can pick up a camera
across the street

596
00:29:08,636 --> 00:29:10,454
at an urgent care center.

597
00:29:10,538 --> 00:29:14,191
And there it is in all its
art deco glory, 264 Garnet.

598
00:29:14,275 --> 00:29:16,260
Can you scrub back and feather
in some biometrics?

599
00:29:16,344 --> 00:29:19,396
I'll lay in
some facial rec and...

600
00:29:21,249 --> 00:29:23,767
- This is from 12 minutes ago.
- Okay. There he is.

601
00:29:23,851 --> 00:29:25,592
And he's holding...

602
00:29:25,986 --> 00:29:27,256
shopping bags.

603
00:29:27,406 --> 00:29:28,990
They empty?

604
00:29:29,168 --> 00:29:30,820
Is he going grocery shopping?

605
00:29:30,959 --> 00:29:33,195
There's a DeCicco's Market
four blocks away.

606
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,084
- That's where the phone is now.
- Wow. Okay.

607
00:29:35,169 --> 00:29:37,194
Well, I guess even killers
have to eat.

608
00:29:37,331 --> 00:29:39,757
Hey, Tiff, Scola,
we've located your elusive pal.

609
00:29:39,842 --> 00:29:41,385
Head over to the City of Hills.

610
00:29:49,543 --> 00:29:50,778
FBI, don't move.

611
00:30:00,419 --> 00:30:02,084
Your kid is gonna be
a grandparent

612
00:30:02,169 --> 00:30:03,536
before you're
on the streets again.

613
00:30:03,621 --> 00:30:05,090
Let's go.

614
00:30:08,429 --> 00:30:09,646
The good news
for you, Marcus,

615
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:11,048
is that you are a small fry.

616
00:30:11,132 --> 00:30:12,382
So you help us
catch the big guy

617
00:30:12,466 --> 00:30:15,217
and maybe you can avoid
the death penalty.

618
00:30:15,302 --> 00:30:17,221
I got nothing for you.

619
00:30:17,305 --> 00:30:18,755
He's sticking to his story.

620
00:30:20,515 --> 00:30:21,766
It's uncanny.

621
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,593
It really is.

622
00:30:23,856 --> 00:30:25,592
She does have your eyes.

623
00:30:27,848 --> 00:30:30,021
No DNA test needed.

624
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:34,570
It's incredible, right,
that new baby smell,

625
00:30:34,655 --> 00:30:36,826
when you hold them close?

626
00:30:37,225 --> 00:30:39,397
There's nothing like it
in the world,

627
00:30:39,482 --> 00:30:41,979
especially not when
they're yours.

628
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:45,404
You, Marcus,
are at a fork in the road.

629
00:30:45,866 --> 00:30:47,833
And so is your baby girl.

630
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:52,022
The fact is, assassinating
a grand jury witness,

631
00:30:52,106 --> 00:30:54,341
best case scenario,
you are looking at supermax.

632
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:57,505
That's 23 hours a day
inside of a windowless box.

633
00:30:57,645 --> 00:31:00,564
<i>No human contact
with anyone for decades.</i>

634
00:31:00,648 --> 00:31:02,866
<i>Decades, Marcus, you can
forget about your baby.</i>

635
00:31:05,553 --> 00:31:08,438
Are you really gonna choose
the tough-guy dumb-ass road?

636
00:31:08,717 --> 00:31:12,120
Come on, Marcus.
Don't ruin her life.

637
00:31:15,602 --> 00:31:16,654
Man.

638
00:31:21,898 --> 00:31:25,536
Blood wins every time.

639
00:31:28,742 --> 00:31:31,761
Okay, we want the name
of the other shooter.

640
00:31:31,845 --> 00:31:33,349
Who is it?

641
00:31:33,647 --> 00:31:36,332
It's Junior Ruiz.

642
00:31:36,541 --> 00:31:39,294
We're gonna need
more than that, okay?

643
00:31:39,387 --> 00:31:41,194
One killer's word over another

644
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:44,108
gets us zilch,
and you, even less.

645
00:31:44,192 --> 00:31:46,943
All right, then how about
the murder guns, huh?

646
00:31:47,027 --> 00:31:49,413
With Ruiz's fingerprints
all over them?

647
00:31:49,497 --> 00:31:50,547
Where are they?

648
00:31:50,631 --> 00:31:51,615
We dumped them
in the river there,

649
00:31:51,699 --> 00:31:53,380
right off of Hell Gate Park.

650
00:31:53,465 --> 00:31:55,100
Okay, now El Feo.

651
00:31:59,456 --> 00:32:01,274
All right, look,
I work for Ruiz, okay?

652
00:32:01,366 --> 00:32:04,100
He says we have work to do,
that is all I know.

653
00:32:04,185 --> 00:32:07,646
So you're tell us that El Feo
told Ruiz what to do, right?

654
00:32:07,732 --> 00:32:09,826
That's the story
you're gonna stick with.

655
00:32:12,253 --> 00:32:14,871
Okay.
We got enough to grab Ruiz.

656
00:32:14,955 --> 00:32:16,173
And if Ruiz flips,

657
00:32:16,257 --> 00:32:17,576
we'll have enough
to grab El Feo.

658
00:32:17,661 --> 00:32:19,676
Mm-hmm.

659
00:32:30,036 --> 00:32:31,715
Junior Ruiz!

660
00:32:31,939 --> 00:32:33,668
FBI! Anybody home?

661
00:32:35,033 --> 00:32:37,336
- Hello?
- OA.

662
00:32:37,875 --> 00:32:39,321
Come look at this.

663
00:32:41,282 --> 00:32:43,360
- It's his car.
- Yep.

664
00:32:50,558 --> 00:32:53,277
Someone forced him
to overdose.

665
00:32:53,361 --> 00:32:55,379
El Feo must have heard
that we grabbed Marcus,

666
00:32:55,463 --> 00:32:57,381
so he killed Ruiz to tie off
the investigation.

667
00:32:57,465 --> 00:32:59,649
Definitely fits within
his pattern to obliterate

668
00:32:59,733 --> 00:33:02,119
any and all threats.

669
00:33:02,203 --> 00:33:04,288
Look, we need
to bring El Feo in.

670
00:33:04,372 --> 00:33:05,989
The case isn't perfect,
but we need to get

671
00:33:06,073 --> 00:33:07,457
- this prick off the streets.
- Okay.

672
00:33:07,541 --> 00:33:10,860
I'll call Isobel, get her okay.

673
00:33:46,714 --> 00:33:49,183
FBI. Hands up.

674
00:34:04,198 --> 00:34:05,982
This one wants to play dumb.

675
00:34:06,066 --> 00:34:07,684
What about you?

676
00:34:07,768 --> 00:34:08,952
Where's El Feo?

677
00:34:09,044 --> 00:34:10,246
<i>No Ingles.</i>

678
00:34:14,271 --> 00:34:16,122
No El Feo, boss.
He's in the wind.

679
00:34:20,283 --> 00:34:22,015
Mr. El Feo was not
at his house.

680
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,916
That means he is in the wind
for now.

681
00:34:24,002 --> 00:34:26,659
Question, how did he get away,
where is he going, and why?

682
00:34:26,744 --> 00:34:29,690
Is he actually running or is
he just out running errands?

683
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:31,472
Okay,
we've been scrubbing through

684
00:34:31,557 --> 00:34:32,973
all the pole camera coverage,
and there's no sign

685
00:34:33,057 --> 00:34:34,681
of El Feo leaving his premises.

686
00:34:34,845 --> 00:34:36,910
Only a Suburban driven
by one of his crew.

687
00:34:36,994 --> 00:34:39,079
I'll track that.

688
00:34:39,163 --> 00:34:41,582
And this is a camera
half a mile from his house.

689
00:34:41,666 --> 00:34:44,752
- There is the Suburban.
- Yeah, yeah. Right there.

690
00:34:44,836 --> 00:34:46,881
So what, he snuck out
of his own house?

691
00:34:46,966 --> 00:34:47,821
Well, guy's a pro.

692
00:34:47,905 --> 00:34:48,989
Knows someone's
always watching him.

693
00:34:49,073 --> 00:34:51,191
Where... where is
that car right now?

694
00:34:51,275 --> 00:34:54,762
Based on traffic cameras,
our last sighting is

695
00:34:54,846 --> 00:34:56,466
the exit for Randall's Island.

696
00:34:56,669 --> 00:34:57,888
All right, hey, Tiff,

697
00:34:57,981 --> 00:34:59,800
<i>any idea where El Feo
might be heading?</i>

698
00:34:59,884 --> 00:35:01,735
Actually, our CW Ralphie said

699
00:35:01,819 --> 00:35:04,169
El Feo invited him
to go fishing.

700
00:35:04,388 --> 00:35:05,973
If he's on Randall's Island,
he might be

701
00:35:06,057 --> 00:35:07,357
headed for Little Hell Gate.

702
00:35:07,442 --> 00:35:08,742
Okay, so our bad guy
is looking

703
00:35:08,826 --> 00:35:11,845
for a little unmolested angling
in the midst of a bloodbath?

704
00:35:11,929 --> 00:35:14,281
You guys head out there.
I'll send back up.

705
00:35:31,048 --> 00:35:32,383
This is Ralphie's car.

706
00:35:34,552 --> 00:35:35,820
There's blood here.

707
00:35:37,855 --> 00:35:39,491
Some more right here.

708
00:35:42,259 --> 00:35:44,829
So maybe El Feo saw through
Ralphie's song and dance?

709
00:35:47,431 --> 00:35:48,749
This way.

710
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:02,113
Look, your friends are here.

711
00:36:05,182 --> 00:36:06,266
What the hell are you doing?

712
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:07,901
You stay out of this, Tiff.

713
00:36:07,985 --> 00:36:09,102
You gotta put that gun down.

714
00:36:09,186 --> 00:36:10,971
Nah, this lying prick
right here,

715
00:36:11,055 --> 00:36:12,673
he's always giving
these big speeches

716
00:36:12,757 --> 00:36:14,341
about protecting
the neighborhood,

717
00:36:14,425 --> 00:36:17,140
about sticking together,
about loyalty!

718
00:36:17,293 --> 00:36:19,228
Ralphie, put the gun down!

719
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:24,704
He killed my brother!

720
00:36:24,789 --> 00:36:26,573
He shot that stuff
up his nose, not me.

721
00:36:26,657 --> 00:36:28,375
Ralphie,
this is the last thing

722
00:36:28,459 --> 00:36:29,576
Michael would want you to do.

723
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:32,046
Nah, nah.
Mike hated this prick.

724
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:35,082
Ralphie, we got him
on the murder charges, okay?

725
00:36:35,166 --> 00:36:36,583
And how long you guys
been trying?

726
00:36:36,667 --> 00:36:38,719
- For years, right, huh?
- You got to trust me, Ralphie.

727
00:36:38,803 --> 00:36:40,454
It's a rock solid
death penalty case.

728
00:36:40,538 --> 00:36:41,688
He's gonna buy thousands
of lawyers.

729
00:36:41,772 --> 00:36:43,320
And he's gonna walk away.
He always does.

730
00:36:43,404 --> 00:36:44,626
Okay, you can go on
with your life,

731
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:46,193
but you got to
put the gun down.

732
00:36:46,277 --> 00:36:48,054
Yeah, sure. Right?

733
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:49,430
What, they gonna give me
a pass, huh,

734
00:36:49,514 --> 00:36:51,097
for killing Ruiz?
I ain't that dumb.

735
00:36:51,199 --> 00:36:53,460
No, the right jury
will see he had it coming.

736
00:36:53,551 --> 00:36:56,355
You don't have the balls, cobarde.

737
00:36:58,006 --> 00:36:59,174
Ralphie.

738
00:37:02,299 --> 00:37:03,939
All right, you're not
leaving me a choice.

739
00:37:04,037 --> 00:37:06,239
Well, we gotta do what we
gotta do then, huh, Tiff?

740
00:37:08,599 --> 00:37:11,089
Come on, Ralphie,
just put the gun down.

741
00:37:11,174 --> 00:37:12,892
- Now!
- He's not listening!

742
00:37:12,977 --> 00:37:15,379
- Quiet!
- Ralphie, please?

743
00:37:18,176 --> 00:37:20,494
Drop the gun!

744
00:37:20,578 --> 00:37:22,196
This lowlife ain't
walking away today.

745
00:37:35,551 --> 00:37:38,871
We need a ambulance
at Little Hell Gate now.

746
00:37:39,001 --> 00:37:40,168
Ralphie.

747
00:37:43,655 --> 00:37:45,123
Come on, Ralphie!

748
00:38:10,923 --> 00:38:12,541
You know, trust me,

749
00:38:12,789 --> 00:38:15,696
I get wanting to avenge
a murdered brother.

750
00:38:16,778 --> 00:38:20,002
Six months after 9/11,
all I wanted to do

751
00:38:20,087 --> 00:38:22,727
was drink and kill.

752
00:38:22,873 --> 00:38:24,190
But you didn't.

753
00:38:24,275 --> 00:38:28,024
Well, I mean, kill, at least.

754
00:38:28,924 --> 00:38:31,392
Walked away
from a ton of money,

755
00:38:32,669 --> 00:38:35,048
become a field agent.

756
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:43,265
Man, the things that grief
will make a person do.

757
00:38:43,661 --> 00:38:46,860
Tiff, you had no way
of knowing that Ralphie

758
00:38:46,945 --> 00:38:48,662
was gonna go after El Feo.

759
00:38:48,747 --> 00:38:52,617
No, but I know
who Ralphie is.

760
00:38:54,848 --> 00:38:55,965
Was.

761
00:38:57,775 --> 00:39:00,477
He is a wild man.
He just is.

762
00:39:01,512 --> 00:39:06,048
So I gotta ask,
why'd you put him under?

763
00:39:08,436 --> 00:39:10,655
I was a big reason why
Ralphie's life fell apart.

764
00:39:11,177 --> 00:39:12,915
What do you mean?

765
00:39:14,722 --> 00:39:16,923
The night that Ralphie
got flopped,

766
00:39:18,584 --> 00:39:22,837
we went out drinking
after a funeral for this cop.

767
00:39:23,968 --> 00:39:28,048
We got really drunk and
pulled this stupid-ass prank,

768
00:39:29,568 --> 00:39:32,071
and Ralphie was the only
one that got caught.

769
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:36,446
The brass leaned on him hard
for names.

770
00:39:38,285 --> 00:39:39,681
But he wouldn't roll.

771
00:39:42,458 --> 00:39:44,327
And so they flopped him.

772
00:39:46,196 --> 00:39:47,932
They took his badge.

773
00:39:50,434 --> 00:39:51,819
If it wasn't
for Ralphie's loyalty,

774
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:53,876
I'd have got blown up too.

775
00:39:56,267 --> 00:40:00,548
So I guess we both owe
Ralphie a big thank you.

776
00:40:11,521 --> 00:40:13,462
To Ralphie.

777
00:40:14,695 --> 00:40:16,479
To Ralphie.

778
00:40:26,113 --> 00:40:28,320
