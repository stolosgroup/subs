1
00:00:01,156 --> 00:00:03,841
- I am not saying that your
coworker is right or wrong.

2
00:00:03,866 --> 00:00:06,533
Amira, I am just saying that
he is entitled to his opinion.

3
00:00:06,558 --> 00:00:09,648
Whether or not you agree
with that is up to...

4
00:00:09,673 --> 00:00:11,336
How is that sexist?

5
00:00:12,141 --> 00:00:13,528
It is too early for this, okay?

6
00:00:13,553 --> 00:00:15,303
Please save the
postmodern Muslim

7
00:00:15,328 --> 00:00:16,776
progressive grad student
speech for someone else.

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,177
- Excuse me. Excuse
me. Excuse me, sir.

9
00:00:19,202 --> 00:00:20,885
- Call you back.

10
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:22,302
Can I help you?

11
00:00:22,327 --> 00:00:23,953
- Some man just... He
tried to attack me.

12
00:00:23,978 --> 00:00:24,867
- How? When?

13
00:00:24,892 --> 00:00:26,352
- Like, five minutes
ago. He had a knife.

14
00:00:26,377 --> 00:00:27,776
- Okay, are you all right? Do
you need medical attention?

15
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,721
- No, no, no, he
grabbed my arm, and I...

16
00:00:29,746 --> 00:00:32,097
- Wallet and watch now.

17
00:00:33,844 --> 00:00:34,797
Now.

18
00:00:34,822 --> 00:00:35,997
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

19
00:00:36,138 --> 00:00:37,446
Just relax, all
right? Put the gun...

20
00:00:37,471 --> 00:00:39,342
- Wallet and watch
or you're a dead man.

21
00:00:39,526 --> 00:00:40,984
- Do what he says, bitch.

22
00:00:44,187 --> 00:00:45,449
- Okay. All right.

23
00:00:45,709 --> 00:00:48,189
Okay. Okay.
- Come on!

24
00:00:48,244 --> 00:00:52,335
- All right. There you go.

25
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,720
- Let's go.
- All right, all right.

26
00:00:53,745 --> 00:00:55,312
Just take it.

27
00:01:09,255 --> 00:01:13,085
- Next time a girl waves at
you, keep walking, dumbass.

28
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:28,923
- You okay? I called 911.

29
00:01:29,058 --> 00:01:30,669
Cops will be here any second.

30
00:01:32,994 --> 00:01:35,445
- Nina? Hey.

31
00:01:36,008 --> 00:01:37,575
Okay, I'll be there
in 30 minutes.

32
00:01:37,772 --> 00:01:39,372
I'm just dealing with
something personal.

33
00:01:44,153 --> 00:01:48,292
<font color="#ff268c"><i>Resync By M_I_S
www.opensubtitles.org</i></font>

34
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:52,221
- So what do we got?

35
00:01:52,246 --> 00:01:58,295
- Female, Hispanic, about 25,
no purse, no ID, no phone.

36
00:01:58,483 --> 00:01:59,920
- So we're thinking robbery?

37
00:02:00,366 --> 00:02:01,367
- Looks that way.

38
00:02:12,505 --> 00:02:14,062
Hey, everything good?

39
00:02:14,087 --> 00:02:15,087
- All good.

40
00:02:17,301 --> 00:02:19,085
- Whoa, what happened?

41
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:21,635
- I, uh, took a spill
while I was jogging.

42
00:02:22,128 --> 00:02:23,825
- But you're okay?

43
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:26,505
- Yeah. I'll have ERT
start to process the scene.

44
00:02:30,099 --> 00:02:31,578
- Morning, folks.

45
00:02:31,603 --> 00:02:33,170
So victim was killed
in a federal park,

46
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:34,501
which means this one's all ours.

47
00:02:34,688 --> 00:02:36,533
Preliminary report
suggests she's Hispanic,

48
00:02:36,558 --> 00:02:38,125
approximately 25 years old.

49
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:40,359
Other than that, we are
starting at the beginning.

50
00:02:40,384 --> 00:02:42,516
So we get an ID yet?

51
00:02:42,675 --> 00:02:43,815
- Got a hit on facial rec.

52
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,756
Her name is Marta Muñoz.

53
00:02:46,781 --> 00:02:47,807
- Uh-huh.

54
00:02:47,832 --> 00:02:49,299
All right, start
preaching to us.

55
00:02:49,324 --> 00:02:51,174
Elise, tell us
about Marta Muñoz.

56
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:53,592
- No priors, single,
and appears to have

57
00:02:53,617 --> 00:02:55,148
been working as a hairstylist.

58
00:02:55,173 --> 00:02:56,609
- Mm, she file
any police reports

59
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:58,093
or restraining orders
in the last few months?

60
00:02:58,117 --> 00:02:59,117
- Negative.

61
00:02:59,142 --> 00:03:01,219
There's not much of a social
media presence, either.

62
00:03:01,328 --> 00:03:02,968
By all accounts, looks
like she was living

63
00:03:02,993 --> 00:03:04,180
a pretty mundane existence.

64
00:03:04,205 --> 00:03:05,571
- All right, well, let's
get some video in the bath

65
00:03:05,595 --> 00:03:08,359
and start scrubbing. I want pods,
street cams, surveillance video.

66
00:03:08,384 --> 00:03:10,144
This perp didn't just
appear out of thin air.

67
00:03:10,184 --> 00:03:12,227
- Elise, and pull Marta's
last known address

68
00:03:12,252 --> 00:03:14,109
and get it over to
Tiff and Scola, please.

69
00:03:14,138 --> 00:03:15,444
- Got it.

70
00:03:15,539 --> 00:03:16,424
- Good morning.

71
00:03:16,449 --> 00:03:18,102
It looks like we're
starting from scratch.

72
00:03:18,187 --> 00:03:20,823
- Yeah, a quiet part of
town, especially at night.

73
00:03:20,872 --> 00:03:22,198
There's not a lot of
surveillance cameras

74
00:03:22,222 --> 00:03:24,315
down there, either.
- Forensics?

75
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,472
- OA and Nina are at the
M.E.'s office right now.

76
00:03:32,064 --> 00:03:34,153
- Cause of death
is strangulation.

77
00:03:34,178 --> 00:03:36,093
You can see the
bruising under the neck.

78
00:03:36,118 --> 00:03:39,208
Hyoid bone was crushed,
cutting off the flow of oxygen.

79
00:03:39,233 --> 00:03:40,669
- What about the
marks on her wrist?

80
00:03:40,694 --> 00:03:41,760
- Ratchet marks.

81
00:03:42,115 --> 00:03:43,421
- The killer used handcuffs.

82
00:03:43,446 --> 00:03:44,792
- Looks like it.

83
00:03:44,817 --> 00:03:46,097
- So that he could strangle her?

84
00:03:46,122 --> 00:03:47,307
- So he could rape her.

85
00:03:47,332 --> 00:03:49,769
There's significant
tearing and abrasions.

86
00:03:50,384 --> 00:03:52,256
He leave
any DNA behind?

87
00:03:52,281 --> 00:03:53,909
- No, unfortunately.

88
00:03:53,934 --> 00:03:55,066
- Nothing under the fingernails?

89
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:56,221
- Nothing.

90
00:03:56,246 --> 00:03:58,393
I wish I had more
answers for you.

91
00:03:58,628 --> 00:03:59,803
- So do we.

92
00:04:14,911 --> 00:04:16,913
Hi. Mrs. Muñoz?
- Yes?

93
00:04:16,938 --> 00:04:20,767
- Hi, we're Special
Agents Chase and Zidan.

94
00:04:20,877 --> 00:04:22,182
- What's going on?

95
00:04:22,207 --> 00:04:24,775
Has something happened?

96
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,759
- Yes, I'm afraid so.

97
00:04:27,134 --> 00:04:28,483
- Oh, my God.

98
00:04:28,508 --> 00:04:31,337
It's Marta, isn't it?

99
00:04:31,448 --> 00:04:32,884
- I'm sorry to
say, your daughter

100
00:04:32,909 --> 00:04:34,610
was killed this morning.

101
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,663
- Hey. I got you. I got you.

102
00:04:43,758 --> 00:04:47,153
- Marta was a good
girl, a good daughter.

103
00:04:47,178 --> 00:04:49,093
- Was she having any problems?

104
00:04:49,118 --> 00:04:51,860
Was anybody threatening
her, maybe an ex-boyfriend?

105
00:04:52,102 --> 00:04:54,017
- No, nothing like that.

106
00:04:54,089 --> 00:04:56,048
She wasn't dating anyone.

107
00:04:56,073 --> 00:04:58,815
And her last boyfriend
was very nice.

108
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:01,089
He moved to Texas, I think.

109
00:05:01,114 --> 00:05:03,766
- Okay, did she mention
anything unusual lately?

110
00:05:04,023 --> 00:05:05,317
- Like what?

111
00:05:05,342 --> 00:05:08,725
- Did she mention somebody
who might have been scary,

112
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,982
anybody following
her, watching her?

113
00:05:11,332 --> 00:05:13,160
- Last week.

114
00:05:13,256 --> 00:05:14,910
She said that some
guy was watching her

115
00:05:14,935 --> 00:05:17,241
when she closed up the salon.

116
00:05:17,468 --> 00:05:19,644
I told her she should
start taking taxis.

117
00:05:19,926 --> 00:05:22,538
It's too dangerous to take the
subway at that time of night,

118
00:05:22,563 --> 00:05:25,435
but she wanted to save money.

119
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:27,578
She kept talking about
buying a house up

120
00:05:27,603 --> 00:05:29,040
in Westchester someday.

121
00:05:34,238 --> 00:05:38,068
Did this man, did he...

122
00:05:38,093 --> 00:05:40,574
Did he do more
than just kill her?

123
00:05:43,497 --> 00:05:44,497
- Yes.

124
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:58,234
- We are gonna find the
man that hurt Marta.

125
00:05:58,423 --> 00:05:59,642
Okay?

126
00:05:59,667 --> 00:06:01,422
He's gonna pay for what he did.

127
00:06:03,611 --> 00:06:04,611
I promise.

128
00:06:09,735 --> 00:06:11,911
I'm so sorry.

129
00:06:15,216 --> 00:06:16,779
- All right, listen
up, Yankee fans.

130
00:06:16,804 --> 00:06:19,111
Marta told her mother
someone was watching her

131
00:06:19,136 --> 00:06:21,660
near the salon around
closing time last week.

132
00:06:21,685 --> 00:06:22,997
So let's start pulling video

133
00:06:23,022 --> 00:06:25,372
near the Left Bank Hair
Salon on East 8th Street.

134
00:06:26,054 --> 00:06:28,100
- Hey, you got a sec?

135
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:29,170
- Yeah.

136
00:06:35,616 --> 00:06:37,638
- I just got off the phone
with Detective Chavez

137
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:39,099
at the 27th precinct.

138
00:06:39,188 --> 00:06:40,972
I am so sorry. I had no idea.

139
00:06:40,997 --> 00:06:42,935
- I'm fine.

140
00:06:43,888 --> 00:06:45,763
- I don't care how long
you've been on the job.

141
00:06:45,788 --> 00:06:47,311
Being robbed at gunpoint...

142
00:06:47,336 --> 00:06:48,896
- It was not a big deal.

143
00:06:49,734 --> 00:06:51,780
He asked for my wallet.
I gave it to him.

144
00:06:52,007 --> 00:06:53,574
That was that.

145
00:06:53,668 --> 00:06:56,932
- Well, NYPD has offered
to let us handle the case.

146
00:06:56,957 --> 00:06:58,437
So if you...
- No, no, no.

147
00:06:58,462 --> 00:07:00,142
I appreciate that, but
it was a few addicts

148
00:07:00,167 --> 00:07:01,499
trying to make a quick buck.

149
00:07:01,524 --> 00:07:02,482
Isobel, that's it.

150
00:07:02,507 --> 00:07:04,248
- I'm not so sure about that.

151
00:07:04,273 --> 00:07:05,970
Case detective thinks
that these two perps

152
00:07:05,995 --> 00:07:09,041
are responsible for at
least ten other robberies.

153
00:07:09,246 --> 00:07:11,161
- Okay. Well, that's your call.

154
00:07:11,186 --> 00:07:12,404
But I'm good.

155
00:07:13,774 --> 00:07:15,515
- If that's what you want, okay.

156
00:07:19,779 --> 00:07:21,216
- If you don't
mind, I would prefer

157
00:07:21,241 --> 00:07:23,547
to keep this private, though.

158
00:07:23,727 --> 00:07:24,815
- Yeah, of course.

159
00:07:30,841 --> 00:07:32,544
- Hey. How'd it
go with the boss?

160
00:07:32,569 --> 00:07:34,244
- Good, she just needs
me to clean up a report.

161
00:07:34,268 --> 00:07:36,183
- Oh, fun. Well,
it'll have to wait.

162
00:07:36,521 --> 00:07:38,653
The JOC pulled
street cam footage,

163
00:07:38,678 --> 00:07:41,420
and they found the dude
who was following Marta.

164
00:07:41,445 --> 00:07:44,666
We ran facial rec, and that
is him... Norm Carver, 35.

165
00:07:44,691 --> 00:07:47,302
He has two priors, one
for forcible touching,

166
00:07:47,327 --> 00:07:49,634
and one for stalking
in the third degree.

167
00:07:49,659 --> 00:07:51,339
He has warrants out
for his arrest on both.

168
00:07:51,588 --> 00:07:53,677
Also, he's a security
guard off and on,

169
00:07:53,709 --> 00:07:55,233
so he owns his own handcuffs.

170
00:07:55,258 --> 00:07:57,987
- Okay. We have an address?

171
00:07:58,763 --> 00:08:01,374
- 2311, 2313...

172
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:04,315
- It's gonna be right up here.

173
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:05,602
- Hey.

174
00:08:05,627 --> 00:08:07,651
I think I spot him at our two.

175
00:08:08,814 --> 00:08:09,989
- Same height, same build.

176
00:08:12,719 --> 00:08:14,269
Yep, that's him.

177
00:08:22,862 --> 00:08:24,933
Stay put.

178
00:08:37,968 --> 00:08:39,448
- Whoa!

179
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,623
Norm Carver, you're
under arrest.

180
00:08:45,648 --> 00:08:47,040
Hey! Hey.

181
00:08:49,401 --> 00:08:51,293
I've had enough,
okay? I've had enough.

182
00:08:51,318 --> 00:08:52,844
Do you understand?
- Hey.

183
00:08:52,869 --> 00:08:54,622
Hey, hey, hey. Is
everything okay?

184
00:08:54,647 --> 00:08:55,865
- Yeah, everything's fine.

185
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:57,641
Norm here just doesn't
like to listen.

186
00:08:58,029 --> 00:08:59,943
- Let's give him
a chance to, OA.

187
00:09:03,854 --> 00:09:05,856
- Yeah, okay.

188
00:09:05,881 --> 00:09:08,362
- Are you gonna cooperate?
- Yeah.

189
00:09:08,387 --> 00:09:10,258
- Hands behind your back.

190
00:09:12,274 --> 00:09:13,274
Let's go.

191
00:09:25,859 --> 00:09:27,730
- No. Don't know her.

192
00:09:27,755 --> 00:09:29,180
- You sure?

193
00:09:30,019 --> 00:09:32,456
- Sure as I can be about
something like that.

194
00:09:32,481 --> 00:09:34,092
- What the hell is
that supposed to mean?

195
00:09:34,428 --> 00:09:35,690
- Means I meet lots of women.

196
00:09:35,871 --> 00:09:37,786
Some I remember, some I don't.

197
00:09:38,162 --> 00:09:39,234
- Okay.

198
00:09:39,259 --> 00:09:43,002
So just to be clear, you don't
remember ever meeting her?

199
00:09:43,408 --> 00:09:44,617
- Correct.

200
00:09:45,497 --> 00:09:46,716
- Okay.

201
00:09:48,553 --> 00:09:50,207
Well, this is last week.

202
00:09:50,232 --> 00:09:51,687
That's you and that's Marta.

203
00:09:53,787 --> 00:09:55,571
- A man's allowed to
walk down the street.

204
00:09:56,073 --> 00:09:57,335
- Why are you lying, Norm?

205
00:09:57,422 --> 00:09:58,656
- Lying?

206
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,240
- You just said that
you don't know her.

207
00:10:00,264 --> 00:10:01,569
- I don't.

208
00:10:01,655 --> 00:10:03,353
Doesn't mean I've
never seen her before.

209
00:10:03,378 --> 00:10:05,510
- You might want to
rethink your strategy here.

210
00:10:05,698 --> 00:10:08,031
Okay, we are
investigating a murder.

211
00:10:10,384 --> 00:10:11,820
- What are you talking about?

212
00:10:11,845 --> 00:10:14,151
- She's dead. Someone
strangled her.

213
00:10:14,176 --> 00:10:16,874
- You're on the short list of
people who could have done it.

214
00:10:17,032 --> 00:10:19,426
- I... I thought this was
about my outstanding warrants.

215
00:10:19,527 --> 00:10:21,773
I got nothing to do
with any of this.

216
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,316
On my mother.

217
00:10:24,341 --> 00:10:26,126
- I'm sure you love
your mother very much,

218
00:10:26,151 --> 00:10:27,587
but we're gonna
need more than that.

219
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:31,844
- Look, I remember walking home,

220
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:34,181
and I saw her near a hair salon.

221
00:10:34,206 --> 00:10:36,556
She was cute, so I
followed her, hoping to,

222
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:38,368
you know, start
up a conversation.

223
00:10:38,607 --> 00:10:39,739
I'm old-school.

224
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,331
I like to chat up
ladies face to face...

225
00:10:41,356 --> 00:10:43,706
Don't like all that swiping
left and right nonsense.

226
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:46,012
- You like to look them
in the eye, is that it?

227
00:10:46,037 --> 00:10:48,822
- That's the best part,
seeing the twinkle.

228
00:10:49,136 --> 00:10:51,539
- I'm sure you love to
watch the twinkle disappear,

229
00:10:51,564 --> 00:10:53,520
too, right... The
life leave their eyes?

230
00:10:53,545 --> 00:10:54,368
- No!

231
00:10:54,393 --> 00:10:56,544
I followed that lady
for a few blocks,

232
00:10:56,569 --> 00:10:59,659
said hello, then I tried
to start up a conversation,

233
00:10:59,684 --> 00:11:01,425
but she was scared,
so I stopped talking

234
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:02,756
and walked away.

235
00:11:03,022 --> 00:11:05,111
- Because you're a gentleman?
- Exactly.

236
00:11:05,136 --> 00:11:06,877
- Gentlemen don't have
priors for stalking

237
00:11:06,902 --> 00:11:08,730
and forceable touching, Norm.

238
00:11:08,972 --> 00:11:10,626
- That's all in the past.

239
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:12,711
I had a crazy ex-girlfriend.

240
00:11:12,736 --> 00:11:14,956
She got wasted and
called the police.

241
00:11:15,183 --> 00:11:17,185
- You got a second?

242
00:11:22,173 --> 00:11:24,250
So NYPD just found another body,

243
00:11:24,275 --> 00:11:25,776
same MO as Marta's murder...

244
00:11:25,801 --> 00:11:27,001
Sexual assault, strangulation,

245
00:11:27,031 --> 00:11:28,337
handcuffs on the
wrist this time.

246
00:11:28,518 --> 00:11:30,955
- Time of death?
- An hour ago.

247
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:33,504
Prince Charming is not our guy.
- Okay, are we sure about that?

248
00:11:33,529 --> 00:11:35,361
I mean, there's more than one
angry white dude in the city.

249
00:11:35,385 --> 00:11:37,365
- Yeah, we checked his phone's
location, pulled video.

250
00:11:37,389 --> 00:11:39,020
He was in Bed-Stuy at the
time of Marta's murder,

251
00:11:39,044 --> 00:11:40,563
so he's not our guy.

252
00:11:40,588 --> 00:11:42,480
But I'll make sure he gets
booked on those warrants.

253
00:11:42,504 --> 00:11:43,984
You guys head down
to the scene, okay?

254
00:11:44,152 --> 00:11:46,055
- Okay.
- Thanks.

255
00:11:46,186 --> 00:11:50,110
- Female, white, age 27,
name's Andrea Morris.

256
00:11:50,135 --> 00:11:52,616
- Any witnesses?
- No... not yet, anyway.

257
00:11:52,641 --> 00:11:54,860
- But we're on it. We have
agents out canvassing.

258
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:56,540
- We got to stop
meeting like this.

259
00:11:56,565 --> 00:11:58,294
- I couldn't agree more.
- What's the matter?

260
00:11:58,318 --> 00:11:59,720
You guys don't have
enough resources?

261
00:11:59,744 --> 00:12:01,344
Forgot how to solve
a simple murder case?

262
00:12:01,369 --> 00:12:03,141
- What did you say?

263
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:05,157
- What the hell are
you talking about?

264
00:12:05,181 --> 00:12:06,879
- We are doing
everything we can...

265
00:12:06,904 --> 00:12:08,964
Everything, do you understand?

266
00:12:08,989 --> 00:12:10,446
- Get out of my face.
- Or what?

267
00:12:10,471 --> 00:12:11,670
- Whoa, whoa,
whoa. Omar, chill.

268
00:12:11,694 --> 00:12:13,513
- Okay. All right.

269
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:16,539
That's enough. Back off.
- He's out of line.

270
00:12:16,564 --> 00:12:17,924
He's got no right
talking that way.

271
00:12:17,949 --> 00:12:19,700
- Yeah, maybe we stop
with the jokes, okay?

272
00:12:19,725 --> 00:12:20,900
We have two dead bodies.

273
00:12:28,116 --> 00:12:29,640
Hey.

274
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:30,837
What was that all about?

275
00:12:30,862 --> 00:12:32,211
I mean, the guy was joking.

276
00:12:32,236 --> 00:12:33,890
A bad joke, sure, but still.

277
00:12:33,915 --> 00:12:36,265
- You do not joke
about stuff like this.

278
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:37,726
- OA's right.

279
00:12:37,751 --> 00:12:39,274
That was out of line.

280
00:12:39,299 --> 00:12:41,107
- You good, Omar?

281
00:12:42,275 --> 00:12:44,495
- Yeah, I'm fine.

282
00:12:49,089 --> 00:12:50,404
- Poor girl.

283
00:12:50,813 --> 00:12:52,904
I can't imagine how
scared she must have felt.

284
00:12:53,821 --> 00:12:56,529
You know, being so
alone and so vulnerable.

285
00:12:58,361 --> 00:12:59,667
- This guy knows
what he's doing.

286
00:12:59,966 --> 00:13:02,621
He filed the serial number
off of the handcuffs.

287
00:13:05,171 --> 00:13:07,560
- The ADIC is getting
anxious, and the mayor wants

288
00:13:07,585 --> 00:13:09,450
to set up a press
conference, so please,

289
00:13:09,475 --> 00:13:11,825
tell me something good.
- I wish I could.

290
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:13,983
ERT came up empty at
the second crime scene.

291
00:13:14,008 --> 00:13:15,305
- No forensics.

292
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:17,312
The killer's obviously
using condoms and gloves.

293
00:13:17,337 --> 00:13:19,091
- Okay. What about
the handcuffs?

294
00:13:19,116 --> 00:13:21,075
- Still being processed.
- All right.

295
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,383
You two get over
to the crime lab

296
00:13:22,408 --> 00:13:24,039
and light a fire
under their asses.

297
00:13:24,064 --> 00:13:26,980
We have got two murders in
two days and not one clue.

298
00:13:27,074 --> 00:13:30,164
- Hmm, hate to say
it, but he's good.

299
00:13:30,548 --> 00:13:32,375
- Now, maybe.

300
00:13:32,627 --> 00:13:35,021
What about before?
- What do you mean?

301
00:13:35,139 --> 00:13:37,013
- Well, he didn't just
wake up two days ago

302
00:13:37,038 --> 00:13:38,997
and become a killer, right?

303
00:13:39,022 --> 00:13:42,516
This guy had a life before.
So what was he doing?

304
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:44,898
What kinds of crimes
was he committing?

305
00:13:44,923 --> 00:13:46,848
He didn't go from model
citizen to killer overnight.

306
00:13:46,872 --> 00:13:48,696
- Right, he worked his
way up to the big leagues,

307
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,273
started small.
- Harassment, stalking.

308
00:13:51,424 --> 00:13:52,773
- Yeah, and then moved on

309
00:13:52,798 --> 00:13:54,582
to more serious
crimes, like rape.

310
00:13:54,607 --> 00:13:56,837
- And got better along the
way, learned from his mistakes.

311
00:13:56,861 --> 00:13:57,648
- Right.

312
00:13:57,673 --> 00:13:59,504
All right, people,
let's start digging

313
00:13:59,529 --> 00:14:01,898
into recent sexual assault
cases in the Lower East Side.

314
00:14:01,952 --> 00:14:03,606
Scrub any and all police reports

315
00:14:03,631 --> 00:14:04,881
within the last three months.

316
00:14:04,906 --> 00:14:06,319
Look for victims that
match the profile

317
00:14:06,343 --> 00:14:07,867
of our two recent
murder victims.

318
00:14:07,892 --> 00:14:09,305
All right, grab your
hoes and spades.

319
00:14:09,329 --> 00:14:10,112
Get to work.

320
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:19,945
- Detective Chavez, I
don't have a lot of time.

321
00:14:20,055 --> 00:14:21,666
I'm in the middle
of an investigation.

322
00:14:21,722 --> 00:14:22,961
- I won't be long, promise.

323
00:14:22,986 --> 00:14:24,626
I just want to go over
your police report,

324
00:14:24,651 --> 00:14:27,305
see if you remember anything
that might be helpful.

325
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:28,828
- What does that mean?

326
00:14:29,373 --> 00:14:31,157
- Excuse me?

327
00:14:31,341 --> 00:14:32,995
- I told the cop
everything that happened.

328
00:14:33,262 --> 00:14:34,828
- I know, it's just
that, sometimes,

329
00:14:34,853 --> 00:14:36,899
people remember things
down the road, you know?

330
00:14:37,722 --> 00:14:39,854
In the moment, there's
so many emotions.

331
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,609
It's like, you can't really
process what just happened.

332
00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:45,952
- Yeah, I get it. I
do this for a living.

333
00:14:46,086 --> 00:14:48,436
- No, you solve
cases for a living.

334
00:14:48,461 --> 00:14:50,463
It's, uh... it's different.

335
00:14:50,488 --> 00:14:53,099
- Okay, well, like I said,
I don't have a lot of time.

336
00:14:53,428 --> 00:14:55,126
- You told the
responding officer that

337
00:14:55,151 --> 00:14:56,935
you didn't see either
of the perps' faces.

338
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,312
Is that true?

339
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:02,677
- Of course I did, I...
It just happened fast.

340
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,270
- You described the
female assailant as white,

341
00:15:05,295 --> 00:15:07,773
thin build, average height.

342
00:15:08,418 --> 00:15:12,074
Anything else you want
to add... Tattoos, scars?

343
00:15:12,099 --> 00:15:13,320
- Uh, no.

344
00:15:13,345 --> 00:15:15,172
That's, uh, everything
that I remember.

345
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:17,625
- And the male assailant,

346
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,290
wearing a hoodie,
medium height and build?

347
00:15:19,315 --> 00:15:20,625
- That's correct.

348
00:15:20,816 --> 00:15:22,914
- And you said neither
one actually attacked you.

349
00:15:22,939 --> 00:15:26,414
They just asked for your
wallet and you handed it over?

350
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:28,769
- Yep.

351
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:31,972
- Hmm.

352
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:37,566
Look, Omar, these two perps
have been pretty active,

353
00:15:37,738 --> 00:15:39,538
and they're getting more
and more violent too.

354
00:15:39,751 --> 00:15:43,232
They're flashing guns,
pistol-whipping people.

355
00:15:43,421 --> 00:15:45,467
We need to get them
off the streets.

356
00:15:45,492 --> 00:15:47,624
- And I wish I could
help you. I really do.

357
00:15:47,649 --> 00:15:50,203
But I saw what I saw.

358
00:15:50,525 --> 00:15:52,702
- Would you be willing
to look at some photos?

359
00:15:52,727 --> 00:15:53,852
- I told you, I saw what I saw.

360
00:15:53,876 --> 00:15:55,312
- I know you didn't get a
good look at their faces,

361
00:15:55,336 --> 00:15:57,073
but sometimes, seeing
a picture stimulates

362
00:15:57,098 --> 00:15:58,752
a victim's recollection.

363
00:15:58,777 --> 00:16:00,843
Helps people remember things
that they wouldn't remember.

364
00:16:00,867 --> 00:16:04,654
- Detective, I did not get
a good look at their faces.

365
00:16:04,816 --> 00:16:06,006
Okay?

366
00:16:06,157 --> 00:16:08,486
You can save this
victim self-help crap

367
00:16:08,511 --> 00:16:09,511
for someone else.

368
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:20,608
- This guy is
picking up the pace

369
00:16:20,641 --> 00:16:22,351
and we are no closer
to identifying him.

370
00:16:22,376 --> 00:16:24,158
- Where are we at with
the prior police reports?

371
00:16:24,182 --> 00:16:25,415
Any similarities worth chasing?

372
00:16:25,439 --> 00:16:27,595
- We might have something.

373
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:30,448
NYPD filed a report
three weeks ago

374
00:16:30,473 --> 00:16:32,562
about a young woman
who was assaulted.

375
00:16:35,118 --> 00:16:36,250
- Uh-huh.
- Hmm.

376
00:16:36,275 --> 00:16:39,125
Those abrasions certainly look
like they're from restraints.

377
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:40,570
Who is she and what do we know?

378
00:16:40,595 --> 00:16:44,119
- Citra Susanti, 25,
claims a guy in a ski mask

379
00:16:44,144 --> 00:16:45,773
dragged her into an alley,

380
00:16:45,798 --> 00:16:47,539
used a zip tie to
bind her hands.

381
00:16:47,564 --> 00:16:48,912
- All right, good.
I mean, zip ties,

382
00:16:48,936 --> 00:16:50,635
not handcuffs, but close enough.

383
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,053
It still fits the
killer's profile.

384
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:54,123
- Then what happened?
- Nothing.

385
00:16:54,148 --> 00:16:56,258
According to the report, she
managed to fight him off.

386
00:16:56,282 --> 00:16:58,458
- Anyone identified or taken
into custody behind it?

387
00:16:58,483 --> 00:17:00,833
- Negative... the cop who wrote
the report noted the victim

388
00:17:00,858 --> 00:17:02,469
was reluctant to
file a complaint.

389
00:17:02,494 --> 00:17:03,930
The only reason she did was,

390
00:17:03,955 --> 00:17:05,659
a witness heard her
screaming, called the police.

391
00:17:05,683 --> 00:17:06,922
- Understandable.

392
00:17:06,947 --> 00:17:09,036
It's not easy coming forward
after being attacked.

393
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:11,156
- All right, why don't you two
go talk to this young lady?

394
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:13,547
Kelly, send them the address.
- Sure.

395
00:17:13,572 --> 00:17:15,523
- Maybe she saw
something that'll help.

396
00:17:18,751 --> 00:17:22,015
- My memory of that day is
a little foggy, I'm sorry.

397
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,433
- I understand.

398
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:25,492
We just still need to
ask you some questions.

399
00:17:25,517 --> 00:17:27,084
- What do you want to know?

400
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:30,366
- Can you tell us what
happened from the beginning?

401
00:17:34,062 --> 00:17:36,456
- I was out to
dinner with friends,

402
00:17:36,481 --> 00:17:39,963
and I was walking
home when I saw him.

403
00:17:40,245 --> 00:17:42,836
He just moved toward me.

404
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:44,317
- Did you see his face?

405
00:17:44,505 --> 00:17:47,291
- No. He was
wearing a ski mask.

406
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:48,703
- Okay.

407
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:50,561
What happened next?

408
00:17:54,732 --> 00:17:56,453
- He grabbed me.

409
00:17:56,478 --> 00:17:58,828
And then he dragged
me behind a building.

410
00:17:58,853 --> 00:18:01,648
He tried to bind my
hands, so I bit him.

411
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:05,455
But he had gloves on, so I
had to bite down really hard.

412
00:18:05,847 --> 00:18:07,430
He... he ran away.

413
00:18:07,455 --> 00:18:08,652
- Is there a problem?

414
00:18:08,739 --> 00:18:11,047
- No, not at all.

415
00:18:11,072 --> 00:18:12,746
We're just trying to
understand what happened.

416
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:13,989
- She just told you.

417
00:18:14,014 --> 00:18:15,703
- I know that.

418
00:18:15,908 --> 00:18:18,911
But the crime scene photos
tell a different story.

419
00:18:19,318 --> 00:18:23,409
They show that Citra's
wrists had abrasions.

420
00:18:23,434 --> 00:18:27,133
- Are you saying she's lying?
- No, absolutely not.

421
00:18:27,158 --> 00:18:28,884
We're just saying that
injuries like that

422
00:18:28,909 --> 00:18:31,031
indicate that she
was fully restrained.

423
00:18:31,135 --> 00:18:32,516
- What difference does it make?

424
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:34,017
A man attacked her,
but she's still alive.

425
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:35,125
End of story.

426
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:37,219
- It's not as simple
as that, ma'am.

427
00:18:37,244 --> 00:18:40,080
We believe the man who attacked
Citra may have also just

428
00:18:40,105 --> 00:18:43,108
killed two other women,
so we were hoping

429
00:18:43,133 --> 00:18:47,888
for some sort of information
to help us identify him.

430
00:18:48,468 --> 00:18:50,470
I just want to be clear, okay?

431
00:18:52,429 --> 00:18:53,925
This man didn't hurt you?

432
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:55,169
- No.

433
00:18:55,194 --> 00:18:58,197
Like I said, I bit
him and he ran.

434
00:18:58,573 --> 00:18:59,630
- Okay.

435
00:18:59,655 --> 00:19:02,774
I know you didn't see his face,
but did you see his skin color?

436
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:06,368
Do you remember his height
or his build, anything?

437
00:19:06,713 --> 00:19:08,693
- I remember seeing his wrist.

438
00:19:08,917 --> 00:19:12,312
He was white or light-skinned.

439
00:19:12,337 --> 00:19:16,297
And he was average height
and weight, I think.

440
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:18,568
It's hard to remember.

441
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:22,382
I honestly can't remember
a lot about that night.

442
00:19:22,407 --> 00:19:23,669
- For the better.

443
00:19:27,122 --> 00:19:29,224
- Can you just...
- We understand.

444
00:19:30,064 --> 00:19:31,646
And we appreciate your help.

445
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:36,779
If you remember anything
else, please give us a call.

446
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:44,186
- There's more
than she's saying.

447
00:19:44,211 --> 00:19:46,169
- It's possible,
but she needs time.

448
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,764
- Look, I'm not judging
her, OA, trust me,

449
00:19:48,789 --> 00:19:49,789
but she's holding back.

450
00:19:49,818 --> 00:19:51,559
I can see it in her eyes.

451
00:19:51,584 --> 00:19:53,020
- Well, maybe it's pain.

452
00:19:53,045 --> 00:19:54,960
Or maybe it's fear
or humiliation,

453
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:56,608
or the fact that her parents
are hovering over her,

454
00:19:56,632 --> 00:19:59,766
forcing her to pretend
that it never happened.

455
00:20:00,124 --> 00:20:01,444
All right, that
can't help either.

456
00:20:01,532 --> 00:20:02,505
Right?
- Yeah.

457
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:04,474
Yeah, you're right, but...
- But what?

458
00:20:04,499 --> 00:20:07,295
- But it doesn't mean
that I'm wrong, okay?

459
00:20:07,445 --> 00:20:10,448
And I'm not trying to blame
her or revictimize her.

460
00:20:10,911 --> 00:20:13,479
I'm just frustrated, okay,
because I wanted more answers

461
00:20:13,504 --> 00:20:15,506
so that we can catch
this guy before he hurts

462
00:20:15,531 --> 00:20:16,531
or kills other women.

463
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:25,101
- Still got a
killer on the loose,

464
00:20:25,126 --> 00:20:27,625
so we're hoping for good
news and good news only.

465
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:30,087
- Well, I am doing
my best, but...

466
00:20:30,227 --> 00:20:32,711
- Not the start
I was hoping for.

467
00:20:33,335 --> 00:20:35,206
- No fingerprints
on the handcuffs.

468
00:20:35,231 --> 00:20:37,930
Did find DNA, but it belongs
to our victim, Andrea Morris.

469
00:20:37,962 --> 00:20:40,921
- So we got nothing.
- Not exactly.

470
00:20:41,249 --> 00:20:42,555
Serial number was filed off,

471
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:43,922
which initially
made it difficult

472
00:20:43,947 --> 00:20:45,427
to determine the place of sale.

473
00:20:45,728 --> 00:20:47,382
- Initially?
- Yeah.

474
00:20:47,407 --> 00:20:49,496
I remedied it by
using a technique

475
00:20:49,521 --> 00:20:51,226
we normally use on firearms...

476
00:20:51,684 --> 00:20:54,695
Applied some reagents,
etched the metal.

477
00:20:55,245 --> 00:20:57,609
The number reappeared.
- Hmm.

478
00:20:57,634 --> 00:20:59,101
We're gonna need
that serial number

479
00:20:59,126 --> 00:21:00,547
to ascertain the seller.

480
00:21:01,131 --> 00:21:02,476
- That's nice work.

481
00:21:02,738 --> 00:21:06,306
A slow start, but
finished with a flourish.

482
00:21:12,631 --> 00:21:14,062
- Interesting.

483
00:21:14,087 --> 00:21:16,008
I've never been in one
of these stores before.

484
00:21:16,033 --> 00:21:17,867
- Me neither.

485
00:21:18,263 --> 00:21:20,526
Special Agent Scola. This
is Special Agent Wallace.

486
00:21:20,551 --> 00:21:22,162
We need to ask you
a few questions.

487
00:21:22,343 --> 00:21:23,487
- What about?

488
00:21:23,512 --> 00:21:25,401
- A pair of handcuffs
that were sold here

489
00:21:25,426 --> 00:21:26,992
used in a crime.

490
00:21:27,017 --> 00:21:28,581
- What kind of crime?

491
00:21:29,111 --> 00:21:32,288
- We can't say, but your
cooperation is important.

492
00:21:32,437 --> 00:21:34,961
- Look, I'm as pro law
enforcement as they come,

493
00:21:34,986 --> 00:21:36,640
but if you won't tell
me what happened,

494
00:21:36,868 --> 00:21:38,435
I can't help you, can I?

495
00:21:38,481 --> 00:21:39,525
- It's simple, sir.

496
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:41,376
We just need to know who
bought these handcuffs.

497
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,315
- And that means we're
gonna need access

498
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:45,353
to your sales records,
any video footage you have

499
00:21:45,378 --> 00:21:47,674
covering the cash register area.

500
00:21:48,244 --> 00:21:50,899
- Yeah, sorry. That's
not gonna happen.

501
00:21:50,924 --> 00:21:52,659
I mean, my boss would kill me.

502
00:21:52,684 --> 00:21:55,121
The dude is super against any
sort of government overreach.

503
00:21:55,146 --> 00:21:58,018
So unless you got a
warrant, I can't help you.

504
00:21:58,285 --> 00:21:59,285
- We do.

505
00:22:01,951 --> 00:22:04,096
- Do you mind if I take a look?
- Please.

506
00:22:04,121 --> 00:22:06,515
You can read it, frame it,

507
00:22:06,984 --> 00:22:09,393
put it on your wall if you want.

508
00:22:10,151 --> 00:22:12,196
We're not leaving until
we have those records

509
00:22:12,221 --> 00:22:14,267
and that footage.

510
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:15,799
Are we clear?

511
00:22:16,821 --> 00:22:17,821
- Yeah.

512
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:22,282
- Kelly, where are we at
with that surplus store info?

513
00:22:22,307 --> 00:22:24,613
- Well, the inventory list
shows only one pair of cuffs

514
00:22:24,638 --> 00:22:26,466
was sold in the past two weeks.

515
00:22:26,491 --> 00:22:28,427
Trouble is, I've been
scouring credit card receipts

516
00:22:28,451 --> 00:22:30,025
and can't find any
charges that matches

517
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:31,269
the purchase of the cuffs.

518
00:22:31,294 --> 00:22:32,774
- Well, maybe he paid in cash.

519
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:34,394
- What about the cameras
covering the cash register?

520
00:22:34,418 --> 00:22:36,376
- Yeah, I think I
might have something.

521
00:22:36,401 --> 00:22:38,776
Obviously, there's no audio
to go with the footage.

522
00:22:38,818 --> 00:22:40,847
- That's all right. A picture's
worth a thousand words.

523
00:22:40,871 --> 00:22:42,379
Throw it up. Let's
see this guy.

524
00:22:42,404 --> 00:22:44,323
- Well, it's not a guy.

525
00:22:48,521 --> 00:22:50,142
- Does she pop on facial rec?

526
00:22:50,715 --> 00:22:52,717
- Yes. Got an immediate hit.

527
00:22:53,116 --> 00:22:55,988
Barbie Simmons, 35,

528
00:22:56,013 --> 00:22:58,842
has two prior arrests
for solicitation.

529
00:22:58,867 --> 00:23:00,478
- What else do we
know about Barbie?

530
00:23:00,503 --> 00:23:03,114
- Um, arrests were made
by undercover vice cops

531
00:23:03,139 --> 00:23:06,289
conducting sex-for-hire stings.

532
00:23:06,314 --> 00:23:10,144
She apparently specializes
in bondage and roleplaying.

533
00:23:10,169 --> 00:23:12,082
- Hmm. Do we have
an address on her?

534
00:23:12,107 --> 00:23:14,457
- Yes, an apartment
over in Queens.

535
00:23:14,482 --> 00:23:16,402
- All right, well, obviously
she's not our rapist,

536
00:23:16,426 --> 00:23:18,221
but send Tiff and
Scola over nonetheless.

537
00:23:18,246 --> 00:23:19,160
- Yeah.

538
00:23:25,234 --> 00:23:27,008
- FBI, open the door.

539
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:29,690
- Jubal says her phone is
still pinging at this location.

540
00:23:29,818 --> 00:23:31,188
Come on, Barbie.

541
00:23:31,213 --> 00:23:33,039
You can open it up, or
we can kick it down.

542
00:23:33,063 --> 00:23:34,453
It's your choice.

543
00:23:34,571 --> 00:23:35,836
- What's going on?

544
00:23:35,861 --> 00:23:37,789
- The woman who stays
here, you seen her today?

545
00:23:37,991 --> 00:23:39,341
- No, sorry.

546
00:23:39,366 --> 00:23:40,758
- And where's the super stay?

547
00:23:40,783 --> 00:23:42,176
- You're looking at him.

548
00:23:42,201 --> 00:23:44,638
- You got the key?
- Sure do.

549
00:23:50,045 --> 00:23:51,568
- FBI.

550
00:23:55,164 --> 00:23:57,166
- Barbie Simmons?

551
00:23:57,191 --> 00:23:59,086
Anybody home?

552
00:24:07,453 --> 00:24:08,889
The closet's clear.

553
00:24:18,429 --> 00:24:19,429
- We got a body.

554
00:24:24,716 --> 00:24:26,544
I'm guessing that's Barbie.

555
00:24:33,104 --> 00:24:35,727
- Death appears to be from
a violent strangulation,

556
00:24:35,752 --> 00:24:38,364
and based on the advanced
levels of decomposition,

557
00:24:38,389 --> 00:24:41,609
I'd estimate she was
killed about two weeks ago.

558
00:24:41,634 --> 00:24:45,160
Hard to determine exactly when
until I get her on the table.

559
00:24:45,185 --> 00:24:46,857
- What about the
trauma to her face?

560
00:24:46,882 --> 00:24:48,493
Was that before or after death?

561
00:24:48,518 --> 00:24:51,651
- Looks like it was
inflicted post-mortem.

562
00:24:51,676 --> 00:24:53,172
- Son of a bitch
couldn't get enough

563
00:24:53,197 --> 00:24:54,633
even after she was dead.

564
00:24:56,201 --> 00:24:58,781
- Probably got upset she
died, so he got angry

565
00:24:58,806 --> 00:25:00,446
and started punching her.

566
00:25:00,471 --> 00:25:03,387
- Who knows what was
in this guy's head.

567
00:25:03,801 --> 00:25:05,769
- The good news is,
looks like he left behind

568
00:25:05,794 --> 00:25:07,993
some leather fragments.

569
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:10,672
- So he was wearing gloves?
- It appears that way.

570
00:25:10,697 --> 00:25:12,305
I'll run them for DNA.

571
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:14,767
It's a long shot, but
uh, you never know.

572
00:25:15,027 --> 00:25:16,464
- Thanks, Neil.

573
00:25:18,822 --> 00:25:20,780
- Any luck with ERT?
- Nothing.

574
00:25:20,805 --> 00:25:22,938
No working security
cameras in the building.

575
00:25:22,963 --> 00:25:25,096
They think that the suspect
wiped the apartment down

576
00:25:25,121 --> 00:25:26,266
with liquid bleach.

577
00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:28,360
They found a bottle
discarded in the kitchen.

578
00:25:28,608 --> 00:25:30,654
- He left the windows
open, too, to air it out

579
00:25:30,679 --> 00:25:32,313
and delay the discovery.

580
00:25:32,338 --> 00:25:34,296
- This guy's always thinking.

581
00:25:34,335 --> 00:25:36,066
- Well, it's time to
stop admiring his work

582
00:25:36,091 --> 00:25:37,658
and nail his ass.

583
00:25:39,714 --> 00:25:42,227
- Yeah, I appreciate it.

584
00:25:42,729 --> 00:25:44,905
Okay, so the medical
examiner just confirmed

585
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:47,759
that Barbie Simmons was killed
approximately 12 days ago.

586
00:25:48,017 --> 00:25:50,976
So that makes her
our first victim.

587
00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:52,249
- Okay.

588
00:25:52,274 --> 00:25:53,844
Where are we with
the leather fibers?

589
00:25:53,869 --> 00:25:56,176
- Uh, they found two samples,
one was Barbie Simmons,

590
00:25:56,201 --> 00:25:58,393
and the other one
was an unknown female

591
00:25:58,418 --> 00:26:00,351
of Southeast Asian descent.

592
00:26:00,376 --> 00:26:02,742
- So we're thinking Citra?
- I mean, it has to be.

593
00:26:02,767 --> 00:26:04,900
She said she bit down hard
on her attacker's glove.

594
00:26:04,987 --> 00:26:07,511
- Hey, uh, there's
a Detective Chavez

595
00:26:07,536 --> 00:26:09,325
waiting in the boardroom,
says he wants to talk to you

596
00:26:09,349 --> 00:26:11,133
about a photo array.

597
00:26:11,158 --> 00:26:12,329
- A photo array?

598
00:26:12,354 --> 00:26:14,922
- Uh, yeah, unrelated
to this case.

599
00:26:20,421 --> 00:26:22,341
- You couldn't call before
showing up, detective?

600
00:26:22,366 --> 00:26:24,673
- Tried. You didn't pick up.

601
00:26:24,698 --> 00:26:27,048
- That is because I am in
the middle of an active case.

602
00:26:27,716 --> 00:26:28,984
- So am I.

603
00:26:29,454 --> 00:26:31,717
Patrol units just called
me a few minutes ago.

604
00:26:32,031 --> 00:26:33,662
Looks like the two
perps that attacked you

605
00:26:33,686 --> 00:26:35,209
just robbed another guy.

606
00:26:35,234 --> 00:26:36,540
- Okay. You can talk to him.

607
00:26:36,937 --> 00:26:39,305
- Can't. They shot him.

608
00:26:39,853 --> 00:26:41,071
- What?

609
00:26:41,096 --> 00:26:42,820
- He's in bad shape, too.

610
00:26:42,845 --> 00:26:45,148
On the operating
table as we speak.

611
00:26:45,173 --> 00:26:47,937
So with all due respect,
showing up unannounced

612
00:26:47,962 --> 00:26:49,921
isn't my biggest concern.

613
00:26:49,968 --> 00:26:51,404
- You are correct.

614
00:26:51,429 --> 00:26:53,914
My apologies. I am sorry.

615
00:26:54,566 --> 00:26:57,081
- I put together a photo
array of potential suspects

616
00:26:57,106 --> 00:26:58,374
hoping you'll take a look.

617
00:26:58,399 --> 00:26:59,922
Might jog your memory.

618
00:26:59,947 --> 00:27:01,427
It's called guided
visualization...

619
00:27:01,452 --> 00:27:03,193
Pictures, objects, locations.

620
00:27:03,218 --> 00:27:05,916
Seeing them sometimes
jogs repressed memories.

621
00:27:09,258 --> 00:27:10,520
Give it a shot, Omar.

622
00:27:12,664 --> 00:27:14,274
What's the harm in looking?

623
00:27:17,753 --> 00:27:20,974
- Um, I will.

624
00:27:20,999 --> 00:27:22,348
I'm a little
distracted right now.

625
00:27:22,373 --> 00:27:24,680
We just got a lead on our
serial killer, but today.

626
00:27:26,375 --> 00:27:28,812
I promise, you have my word.

627
00:27:28,977 --> 00:27:30,593
- I appreciate that, Omar.

628
00:27:30,618 --> 00:27:32,620
- No, thank you.

629
00:27:34,407 --> 00:27:35,407
- Thank you.

630
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:39,134
- Hey.
- Hey, what's going on?

631
00:27:39,651 --> 00:27:40,913
- Nothing.

632
00:27:41,094 --> 00:27:42,617
- Come on, don't do that.

633
00:27:44,307 --> 00:27:47,031
- Do what?
- Pretend like nothing's wrong.

634
00:27:47,056 --> 00:27:49,493
I'm your partner. Just tell me.

635
00:27:53,657 --> 00:27:56,164
- Two punks tried to
rob me this morning.

636
00:27:56,376 --> 00:27:58,200
The detective has some photos.

637
00:27:58,225 --> 00:28:00,335
He wants me to take a look,
see if I can identify anybody,

638
00:28:00,359 --> 00:28:01,711
but like I told
him this morning,

639
00:28:01,736 --> 00:28:04,870
I didn't get a good look,
because it was not a big deal.

640
00:28:05,814 --> 00:28:07,407
- Okay, well, I'm
sorry that you...

641
00:28:07,432 --> 00:28:09,608
OA, where are you going?

642
00:28:09,633 --> 00:28:10,993
- I want to go talk
to Citra again,

643
00:28:11,018 --> 00:28:12,455
alone this time,
if you don't mind.

644
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,785
The detective gave
me a new angle

645
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:15,421
that we haven't tried yet.

646
00:28:15,549 --> 00:28:16,637
I think it can work.

647
00:28:16,662 --> 00:28:17,967
- Okay.

648
00:28:24,376 --> 00:28:25,942
- I don't know what
else I can tell you.

649
00:28:25,967 --> 00:28:27,534
My memory of that
night is limited.

650
00:28:27,627 --> 00:28:28,976
- I'm sure that it is.

651
00:28:29,001 --> 00:28:30,634
But like I said, the
man that attacked you

652
00:28:30,658 --> 00:28:32,486
killed three other women.

653
00:28:32,511 --> 00:28:33,642
This is important.

654
00:28:33,667 --> 00:28:35,626
- I get it, I do.

655
00:28:35,651 --> 00:28:37,218
But I never saw
the person's face,

656
00:28:37,243 --> 00:28:40,551
and I already told
you what I remember.

657
00:28:40,685 --> 00:28:42,211
- I know.

658
00:28:42,861 --> 00:28:46,430
But maybe we can try again,
because Citra, sometimes,

659
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:48,909
when something
like this happens,

660
00:28:48,934 --> 00:28:51,459
your brain plays a trick on you.

661
00:28:51,484 --> 00:28:55,183
Like it deletes some memory
so that you don't have to deal

662
00:28:55,333 --> 00:28:58,295
with what really happened, so
that you don't have to talk

663
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,584
about it with your
friends or your family,

664
00:29:00,609 --> 00:29:03,176
and feel the embarrassment
or the judgment,

665
00:29:03,201 --> 00:29:06,988
as if, somehow, you getting
attacked was your fault.

666
00:29:07,254 --> 00:29:09,386
- I know what you mean.

667
00:29:09,411 --> 00:29:12,979
I keep replaying that night,
wondering why he picked me.

668
00:29:13,004 --> 00:29:14,354
- I know.

669
00:29:14,379 --> 00:29:16,493
I get it, trust me, but

670
00:29:16,729 --> 00:29:19,819
you know that this was
not your fault, right?

671
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:22,320
- No, I don't.

672
00:29:22,345 --> 00:29:25,046
I... I was in
inappropriate clothing.

673
00:29:25,071 --> 00:29:26,383
- No.

674
00:29:27,409 --> 00:29:30,063
There is no such thing. Okay?

675
00:29:30,088 --> 00:29:31,823
You can wear whatever you
want, wherever you want to.

676
00:29:31,847 --> 00:29:33,806
- It was sinful.

677
00:29:35,907 --> 00:29:39,911
- Even if it was,
okay, the Koran says,

678
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,029
we are all forgiven
our trespass,

679
00:29:42,054 --> 00:29:44,333
and that we must tell the truth.

680
00:29:45,127 --> 00:29:46,607
Right?

681
00:29:46,632 --> 00:29:48,721
So now that we are here,

682
00:29:48,746 --> 00:29:52,786
in the place where
he first grabbed you,

683
00:29:54,328 --> 00:29:55,932
I need you to try and
remember that night

684
00:29:55,957 --> 00:29:56,958
one more time.

685
00:30:01,185 --> 00:30:04,188
- I don't want to.
- Please?

686
00:30:04,213 --> 00:30:05,974
Just try.

687
00:30:06,585 --> 00:30:09,153
It's called guided
visualization.

688
00:30:09,553 --> 00:30:11,120
And I think it might help.

689
00:30:30,111 --> 00:30:33,169
- He didn't just grab me.

690
00:30:33,869 --> 00:30:38,134
He tried to assault
me s... sexually.

691
00:30:38,681 --> 00:30:42,685
He... he zip tied me and
pushed me to the ground,

692
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:46,627
and he... he took his pants off.

693
00:30:49,356 --> 00:30:50,923
But then I bit him.

694
00:30:50,972 --> 00:30:53,017
And I scratched him too.

695
00:30:53,042 --> 00:30:55,349
I must have cut him, because
later, when I got home,

696
00:30:55,374 --> 00:30:56,984
I saw his blood on my blouse.

697
00:30:58,866 --> 00:31:00,912
- He got his blood
on your shirt?

698
00:31:04,282 --> 00:31:07,035
Did you wash it?
- No.

699
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,865
It's at the bottom of my closet.

700
00:31:10,644 --> 00:31:12,167
- That's really good, Citra.

701
00:31:14,202 --> 00:31:15,508
Citra, thank you.

702
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:18,292
Thank you.

703
00:31:21,148 --> 00:31:23,150
The lab is running the
blood on Citra's blouse.

704
00:31:23,175 --> 00:31:25,134
We should know something soon.
- Fingers crossed.

705
00:31:25,159 --> 00:31:27,168
Hey, do you really think
that she didn't remember

706
00:31:27,193 --> 00:31:29,620
until today, or she just
didn't want to talk about it?

707
00:31:29,645 --> 00:31:32,431
- Uh, I don't know.

708
00:31:32,556 --> 00:31:34,166
Maybe both.

709
00:31:34,574 --> 00:31:36,445
But I'm gonna go talk to Chavez.

710
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:37,622
- Yeah?

711
00:31:37,647 --> 00:31:39,605
I thought you said you
didn't get a good look.

712
00:31:40,127 --> 00:31:41,738
- I didn't.

713
00:31:41,763 --> 00:31:44,722
Nina, I didn't, or I
didn't think I did,

714
00:31:44,747 --> 00:31:48,316
but after talking to
Citra, I got to try.

715
00:31:48,341 --> 00:31:51,953
- Yeah, maybe you
just needed more time.

716
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:54,778
It's not easy being a victim.

717
00:31:54,803 --> 00:31:56,848
Really messes with the
way you see things.

718
00:31:58,885 --> 00:32:02,541
I'm not trying to
upset you. I...

719
00:32:02,705 --> 00:32:04,028
- It's not that.

720
00:32:05,951 --> 00:32:07,262
- What?

721
00:32:08,391 --> 00:32:10,567
- The perps that
mugged me shot someone.

722
00:32:12,392 --> 00:32:14,176
He's in critical condition.

723
00:32:14,201 --> 00:32:17,115
The detective doesn't know
if he's gonna make it, and...

724
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:20,615
he's got a family, and...

725
00:32:21,422 --> 00:32:24,338
- Hey, go easy on yourself.

726
00:32:24,479 --> 00:32:27,526
You were mugged. And
you are a victim.

727
00:32:27,942 --> 00:32:30,138
And I don't care who
you are or what you do,

728
00:32:30,163 --> 00:32:32,470
that's really heavy stuff.

729
00:32:41,921 --> 00:32:42,921
- There.

730
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:46,630
That's him.

731
00:32:47,639 --> 00:32:48,950
- You sure?

732
00:32:49,341 --> 00:32:50,575
- I'm positive.

733
00:32:52,686 --> 00:32:53,861
- Okay. Good.

734
00:32:57,252 --> 00:32:59,907
- And that is her,
the female perp.

735
00:33:00,128 --> 00:33:01,607
No doubt about it.

736
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:06,230
- These were the two
we've been tracking.

737
00:33:06,255 --> 00:33:08,173
We just wanted one
more positive ID

738
00:33:08,198 --> 00:33:10,060
before getting a warrant.

739
00:33:10,497 --> 00:33:12,802
- I'm sorry that
it took so long.

740
00:33:13,889 --> 00:33:15,536
- Is what it is.

741
00:33:16,038 --> 00:33:17,866
- The victim that
they shot, how is he?

742
00:33:18,009 --> 00:33:19,208
- I'm not sure.

743
00:33:19,233 --> 00:33:21,232
The last I checked, he
was in rough shape...

744
00:33:21,281 --> 00:33:23,224
Touch and go.

745
00:33:24,104 --> 00:33:26,193
Thanks for your help, Omar.
- Yeah.

746
00:33:31,143 --> 00:33:33,624
- Thank you. Hey,
DNA came back.

747
00:33:33,649 --> 00:33:34,786
We got a hit.

748
00:33:35,112 --> 00:33:38,202
Looks like this son of a bitch
was hiding in plain sight.

749
00:33:39,321 --> 00:33:41,454
It's the clerk from
the surplus store.

750
00:33:51,405 --> 00:33:52,426
- FBI.

751
00:33:52,451 --> 00:33:54,366
Hands where we can see them.

752
00:33:54,876 --> 00:33:56,685
Federal agents.

753
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:58,263
Where's Jason?
- Why? He in trouble?

754
00:33:58,288 --> 00:33:59,440
- Answer the question.
- He left.

755
00:33:59,464 --> 00:34:01,372
He got off shift
like, ten minutes ago.

756
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:03,052
- On foot?
- Yeah.

757
00:34:03,077 --> 00:34:04,896
- What direction did he go in?
- I'm not sure.

758
00:34:04,921 --> 00:34:06,068
- He's not here.

759
00:34:06,093 --> 00:34:08,705
- I saw him talking to a girl
shopping for some cargo pants.

760
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:10,573
- Did she leave with him?
- I guess.

761
00:34:10,598 --> 00:34:12,438
I got a little busy, but
definitely looked like

762
00:34:12,463 --> 00:34:14,553
they were vibing, so probably.

763
00:34:14,578 --> 00:34:16,124
- Jubal, Jason's not here.

764
00:34:16,149 --> 00:34:17,789
He left with a girl
about ten minutes ago.

765
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:19,409
- Copy that. Standby.

766
00:34:19,434 --> 00:34:20,848
Elise, when you
pinged Jason's phone,

767
00:34:20,872 --> 00:34:22,232
he was at the
surplus store, right?

768
00:34:22,257 --> 00:34:24,268
- Yes, or at least
in that general area.

769
00:34:24,293 --> 00:34:26,208
- Yeah. Can you ping it again?

770
00:34:26,233 --> 00:34:28,081
- Cell coverage in that
area is a little spotty,

771
00:34:28,105 --> 00:34:30,151
so I can't give you
an exact location,

772
00:34:30,176 --> 00:34:31,753
but it shows he's still
within a few hundred yards

773
00:34:31,777 --> 00:34:33,300
of the surplus store.

774
00:34:33,325 --> 00:34:36,131
- OA, his cell is still
pinging off the same tower,

775
00:34:36,156 --> 00:34:38,057
so he's still
somewhere in that area.

776
00:34:38,605 --> 00:34:40,912
- Copy that. Okay.
Let's split up.

777
00:34:40,944 --> 00:34:42,417
Check restaurants,
bodegas, anywhere this guy

778
00:34:42,441 --> 00:34:43,472
could be with this girl, yeah?

779
00:34:46,894 --> 00:34:49,549
- Excuse me, sir? Have
you seen this person?

780
00:34:50,044 --> 00:34:51,828
- No.
- All right.

781
00:35:00,946 --> 00:35:03,600
- Excuse me? Have
you seen this guy?

782
00:35:20,775 --> 00:35:22,211
- Guys, I just
heard a woman scream

783
00:35:22,236 --> 00:35:23,716
one block east of
the surplus store.

784
00:35:23,741 --> 00:35:26,570
I'm checking it out now.
- Okay. Copy that. On my way.

785
00:35:28,655 --> 00:35:30,797
- I think it came from one
of the shipping containers.

786
00:35:30,822 --> 00:35:32,203
- I'm right behind you.

787
00:35:35,313 --> 00:35:37,359
Shut up! Shut up!

788
00:35:37,384 --> 00:35:39,734
- Hey! FBI!

789
00:35:39,759 --> 00:35:41,336
Show me your hands!

790
00:35:41,956 --> 00:35:43,566
Here's here, guys. Send backup.

791
00:35:43,591 --> 00:35:44,636
Help is coming.

792
00:35:44,747 --> 00:35:46,531
- Hey. I got her. Go.

793
00:35:58,025 --> 00:36:00,549
- Let's get these
off. I got you, okay?

794
00:36:00,574 --> 00:36:02,663
It's all right.

795
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,726
- NYPD is arriving on the scene.

796
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:12,953
They should have it contained
in the next few minutes.

797
00:36:12,978 --> 00:36:14,762
- Where are you exactly?

798
00:36:16,717 --> 00:36:18,327
- I'm in the rear
of the warehouse.

799
00:36:18,422 --> 00:36:19,597
I lost sight of the suspect,

800
00:36:19,622 --> 00:36:21,232
but he's got to be
in here somewhere.

801
00:36:21,312 --> 00:36:23,444
- Hold your position.
We're headed towards you.

802
00:37:14,575 --> 00:37:15,875
- What's the matter, Jason?

803
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,740
You don't like being on
the other side of this?

804
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:20,625
- Hey, hey, hey! OA, OA, OA!

805
00:37:20,797 --> 00:37:22,240
Enough, enough, enough.

806
00:37:22,265 --> 00:37:23,945
Back off.
- Okay, okay, okay.

807
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:25,309
- You got him. You got him.

808
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:29,304
- I got him.
- You got him. It's good.

809
00:37:36,941 --> 00:37:39,063
- Is the girl okay?
- Yeah, she's fine.

810
00:37:39,088 --> 00:37:41,781
Come on. Take a
breather. It's over.

811
00:37:46,588 --> 00:37:48,187
You did good.

812
00:37:48,494 --> 00:37:50,191
Thank God you got
the bloody shirt

813
00:37:50,232 --> 00:37:53,018
from Citra, otherwise that
girl would have been dead.

814
00:37:53,269 --> 00:37:54,879
- I could have
gotten it earlier.

815
00:37:56,903 --> 00:37:58,339
If she didn't block it out.

816
00:37:58,364 --> 00:38:00,236
If she gave it to us earlier.
- Hey. Hey.

817
00:38:00,261 --> 00:38:02,089
No. Don't say that.

818
00:38:02,114 --> 00:38:03,336
- It's the truth.

819
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:10,007
If she gave NYPD
the bloody shirt

820
00:38:10,032 --> 00:38:11,372
at the beginning, if she...

821
00:38:13,165 --> 00:38:16,940
If she remembered,
then three other girls

822
00:38:16,965 --> 00:38:18,013
would be alive right now.

823
00:38:18,038 --> 00:38:19,474
- She did the best
that she could.

824
00:38:19,499 --> 00:38:22,415
She was humiliated
and traumatized

825
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,233
and scared to tell the
people that she loves

826
00:38:24,258 --> 00:38:26,247
what actually happened to her.

827
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:28,929
OA.

828
00:38:32,027 --> 00:38:34,290
I think she's amazing.

829
00:38:34,533 --> 00:38:36,013
And I don't blame her,

830
00:38:36,038 --> 00:38:38,138
not one minute,
for what happened.

831
00:38:40,504 --> 00:38:42,114
Okay, she worked
through her pain

832
00:38:42,139 --> 00:38:44,794
and her fear and her anger,

833
00:38:44,819 --> 00:38:47,691
and she found the courage to
remember what happened to her.

834
00:38:58,607 --> 00:38:59,652
- You're right.

835
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:04,653
Thank you.

836
00:39:17,922 --> 00:39:19,678
Hi, I'm looking for a patient

837
00:39:19,703 --> 00:39:21,923
who sustained a gunshot
injury earlier today.

838
00:39:21,948 --> 00:39:23,775
I'm not sure his name.

839
00:39:24,096 --> 00:39:27,011
- Um, Peter Atkins.

840
00:39:27,255 --> 00:39:28,604
- And he's still here?

841
00:39:28,629 --> 00:39:32,099
- He's in the ICU,
recovery room 4A.

842
00:39:32,315 --> 00:39:34,796
- Okay. Any idea
how he's doing?

843
00:39:34,821 --> 00:39:36,127
- No, I'm sorry.

844
00:39:36,283 --> 00:39:38,067
- All right, thank you.

845
00:39:52,028 --> 00:39:53,334
- What are you doing here?

846
00:39:56,886 --> 00:39:59,062
- I, uh, I just wanted to
make sure that he was okay.

847
00:39:59,087 --> 00:40:00,677
What about you?

848
00:40:00,702 --> 00:40:03,139
- We just collared the perps.

849
00:40:03,164 --> 00:40:05,482
I just came here to
deliver the good news.

850
00:40:06,564 --> 00:40:08,088
- Nice.

851
00:40:12,685 --> 00:40:14,731
- End of the day,
we're just people.

852
00:40:14,756 --> 00:40:16,062
Badge or no badge.

853
00:40:16,087 --> 00:40:17,661
You know what I mean?

854
00:40:18,628 --> 00:40:19,629
- Yeah.
