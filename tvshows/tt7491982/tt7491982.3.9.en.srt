It was blue.

The trunk was already open,

we can to track her down,

96
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:03,443

You wouldn't believe
the hate she gets.

103
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,589
It's insane, but

104
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:17,991
those are just random tweets.

105
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:19,993
No one's ever made
a real threat.

106
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:22,462
- Been anything unusual
that's happened recently?

107
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:23,863
Maybe an angry stalker,

108
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,331
or a jealous boyfriend
or girlfriend?

109
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:27,767
- No. Not at all.

110
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:30,903
Addie for divorced three years
ago, but it was amicable.

111
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:33,973
Her ex lives in California.
They're good friends.

112

- Does she have anyone new
in her life?

113
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,510
- Yes, she's seeing someone,

114

but I don't know his name.

115

Addie only mentioned him
in passing.

She didn't wanna
talk about it yet.

117

didn't wanna talk about it?

119

120
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,722
she's funny like that.

121
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:51,658
- Did she seem scared of him
at all?

122
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:54,894
- No, no.
She was excited.

123
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,863
Like she was madly in love.

124
00:04:56,929 --> 00:04:58,031
- What about the neighborhood?

125
00:04:58,097 --> 00:05:00,033
Have you noticed
any strange cars parked?

126
00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:02,835
Maybe a blue one?

127
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:05,071
- Not a blue one, but

128
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,707
two days ago, there was
this guy in an SUV

129
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:09,909
just watching our place.

130
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,478
At the time, I just thought he
was some kind of porch pirate,

131
00:05:12,545 --> 00:05:14,747
so I got up the courage
to approach him,

132
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:18,751
but as soon as I got close,
he sped off.

133
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:21,020
- I would really love to have
two agents stay with you

134
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:22,789
in case a ransom call comes in.

135
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:24,390
Is that okay?

136
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:26,025
- Sure.

137
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:28,561
- Please let me know
as soon as you hear anything.

138
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:30,963
- Of course.

139
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,699

Pulitzer nominated

140
00:05:32,765 --> 00:05:34,901
"New York Times" journalist
and frequent cable news guest,

141
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:37,003
Addie Ricard, was abducted
outside of her house

142
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,604
in the West Village.
The man who took her

143
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:41,040
was armed, wore a mask
to disguise his identity.

144
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:43,342
Addie's phone and purse
were untouched.

145
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:46,012
It's unlikely this was simply
a crime of opportunity.

146
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:48,081
- There's also a new
mystery man in her life,

147
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:49,916
someone she wasn't
completely comfortable

148
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:52,018

Let's scrub her phone,

149
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:53,886
see if we can identify
exactly who that is.

150
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:55,555
- We should also pay
special attention

151
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:56,923
to her professional life.

152
00:05:56,989 --> 00:05:58,691
We're looking into
what she's been working on.

153
00:05:58,758 --> 00:06:00,359
Maybe she was on the verge
of something big,

154
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:01,961
a controversial scoop.
- Thanks.

155
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,629
I just got off the phone
with "The Times."

156
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:05,865
No recent threats.
No ransom demands.

157
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:08,401
- All right. Okay, well,
check with that cable news show

158
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:10,703
she was always on, see if
the network has been contacted

159
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:11,971
or is aware of any threats.

160
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,506
What did we learn

But he's been separated

for publicity,

To the apartment that I share

320
00:12:57,309 --> 00:12:58,911
- I'm just doing my job.

321
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:02,381
- I understand.
- Okay.

322
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:05,918
Well, we are gonna need to talk
to Senator Hoffman right away.

323
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:07,419
- I get it.

324
00:13:07,486 --> 00:13:10,356
Is there any chance you guys
can do this discreetly?

325
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:12,958
Maybe meet at his house
instead of his office?

326
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:17,096
- I--I had no idea.

327
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:22,835
I texted her this morning.
She didn't respond.

328
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:24,937
Sometimes that happens.
She gets busy at work.

329
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:26,472
- You two were
seeing each other?

330
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:27,940
- For a few months.

331
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:29,375
- Anything unusual happen
last night?

332
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:30,910
Maybe an argument?
- No. Of course not.

333
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:33,879
No. Things were great.

334
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:35,581
We got together around 8:00

335
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,316
at the M Hotel,
near Bryant Park.

336
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:40,819
Had dinner, a bottle of wine.

337
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:42,888
I gave her a birthday gift.

338
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:44,957

It was a great night.

- What happened after dinner?

341
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:50,863
- We went our separate ways.

342
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:54,266
Headed home around 10:00 or so.

343
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,368
- Okay. We'll need someone
to substantiate that story.

344
00:13:56,435 --> 00:13:59,171
- No, of course.
Talk to my driver, Ron.

345
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:02,308
He picked me up at 8:00,
dropped me off around 10:15.

346
00:14:04,643 --> 00:14:08,247
- The driver confirmed he took
the senator home around 10:00.

347
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:11,116
We're missing something here.

348
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:12,284
If this was about money,

349
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:13,886
we would've heard something
by now.

350
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:15,321
A ransom demand delivered
to Addie's sister

351
00:14:15,387 --> 00:14:17,056
or "The Times,"

352
00:14:17,122 --> 00:14:19,625
but her abductor could've
killed her on the spot.

353
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:20,960
Instead he took her.

354
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:23,329
This was not
a crime of passion.

355
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:26,632
He wanted her alive.
The question is, why?

356
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:29,368
What does he want from her?
- It could be personal.

357
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:32,338
Or he could be some kind
of sexual sadist or predator.

358
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:34,173
- Jubal, I was going
through the security footage

359
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,574
from outside the hotel.
- Uh-huh.

360
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:37,376
- When Addie exits
around 10:00,

361
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:39,211
she's wearing a watch
that she didn't have before.

362
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:40,980
Look.

363
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:42,481
- Yeah. I see it.

364
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,583
Oh, the senator said
he gave her a birthday present.

365
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,418
Wait. Why?

366
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:49,088
- Well, it's a limited edition
Crowley Tempus smartwatch.

367
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:51,257
Means it's got a data plan.

368
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:54,960
We may be able to track her.

369

and to your left.

About 50 feet.

372
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:18,951
It's moving, but slowly,
so probably on foot.

373
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:26,025
- We got a few dozen homeless

374
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:27,426
No sign of Addie.

She was bleeding.

was sponsored by his uncle,

477
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,484
Sergei Branislav.
- Okay.

What do we know about him?

479
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:55,253
- He's been here for 32 years.

480
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,955
He graduated from NYU, and,

481
00:20:57,022 --> 00:20:58,957
like his nephew, he also
works in real estate.

482
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:00,459
He owns a bunch
of rental properties

483
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:02,461
and a few warehouses...

484
00:21:02,527 --> 00:21:04,529
including the one
where Addie was being held.

485
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,832
245 Weller Road.

486
00:21:06,898 --> 00:21:08,867
- He owns that building.
- Okay, okay.

487
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:11,370
Are Viktor and Sergei connected
to Addie Ricard in any way?

488
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:12,738
- I don't think so.
I've been running

489
00:21:12,804 --> 00:21:14,773
all kinds of screens,
but I keep coming up empty.

490
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,808
- Hmm, what about
Senator Hoffman?

491
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:18,410
There a possible nexus there?

492
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:20,445
- I've been looking,
but so far nothing.

493
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:22,414

two Russian immigrants

494

a young female journalist

496
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:27,719
and not even bother
to ask for ransom?

497
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:30,489
- I can think of a few reasons,
all of them bad.

498
00:21:30,555 --> 00:21:31,923
- Do these two have any priors?

499
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,392
Have they ever
been investigated

500
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,560
for any kind of sex crimes?
- I don't know.

501
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:37,029
The State Department
just flagged

502

503

- No, that's a good thing.

506

working the guy.

We need to see him ASAP.

509
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,645
- We've been up on Sergei
for seven months.

510
00:21:53,712 --> 00:21:55,747
He's connected to
an organized crime syndicate

511
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:57,683
we've been focused on
that's based in Moscow.

512
00:21:57,749 --> 00:21:58,950
- And how does he fit in?

513
00:21:59,017 --> 00:22:00,519
- He's their connection
stateside.

514
00:22:00,585 --> 00:22:01,987
He's more of
a peripheral player.

515
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:03,922
- Peripheral?
How so?

516
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:06,558
- He invests the syndicate's
dirty money.

517
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:09,027
Buys up commercial real estate
all across New York.

518
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:10,662
He handles the money,
but otherwise

519
00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:11,997
keeps his hands clean.

520
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:13,732
- So why would someone
like this

521
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:15,400
want to abduct a journalist?

522
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:17,469
- I'm not sure, but
we just found some video

523
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:19,471
we think might be related

00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:39,758
Was there any damage?

636
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:41,326
- Some broken glass.

637
00:27:41,393 --> 00:27:43,695
We also found some blood.

638
00:27:43,762 --> 00:27:46,331
Guessing one of the vagrants
probably cut himself somehow.

639
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:48,066
- And you already arrested him,
right?

640
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:50,902
- Mm-hmm.
- So what do you need from me?

641
00:27:50,969 --> 00:27:52,203
- Well, we're trying
to ascertain

642
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:54,105
if there was
any property stolen,

643
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:55,840
so if you'd like
to make a statement,

644
00:27:55,907 --> 00:27:57,876
we can, um, file a complaint,

645
00:27:57,942 --> 00:28:00,211
press criminal charges.

646
00:28:00,278 --> 00:28:02,113
- Yeah, I'm sure

647
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,182
whatever losses, if any,
were minimal,

648
00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:07,052
so no, just let the guy go.

649
00:28:07,118 --> 00:28:09,120
That's fine with me.

650
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:10,922
Thank you.

651
00:28:10,989 --> 00:28:12,323
- Tiffany, you gotta
keep him talking.

652
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:14,159
We're not there yet.

653
00:28:14,225 --> 00:28:15,960
- You sure you don't want me

654
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:17,829
to write up a report?

655
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:19,864
You know, the insurance won't
pay if you don't file charges.

656
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,802
Let me show you this guy.

657
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:25,804
- Um...

658
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,172
- How much more time
do you need?

659
00:28:27,238 --> 00:28:28,773
- To capture all his cell data
and the call logs,

660
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,141
another 30 seconds.

661
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:32,410
- Sorry. One sec.

662
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:34,813
Um, just give me

663
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:36,815
one second...

664
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:41,152
So sorry.

665
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:43,221
One sec.

666
00:28:43,288 --> 00:28:46,091
Oh! Okay.
Here we go.

667
00:28:46,157 --> 00:28:48,927
Name's Mike Townes.
He's a local meth head.

668
00:28:48,993 --> 00:28:51,396
Likes to break into cars
and buildings.

669
00:28:51,463 --> 00:28:53,498
You know, it won't be long
before he's robbing people

670
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:54,866
up close and personal.

671
00:28:54,933 --> 00:28:56,501
If you file a charge,

672
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,870
I can violate his probation
and get him off the streets.

673
00:28:58,937 --> 00:29:00,772
- Got it.

674
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:03,408
All done.
- No, I'm good.

675
00:29:03,475 --> 00:29:05,343
Thanks for notifying me,
though.

676
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,378
- Appreciate your time,
Mr. Branislav.

♪ ♪

678
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:13,985
- Focus on the outgoing calls
he made

679
00:29:14,052 --> 00:29:16,121
directly after the meeting
with the senator this morning.

680
00:29:16,187 --> 00:29:17,789
- There's only one.
It's to another burner.

681
00:29:17,856 --> 00:29:20,291
- Location?
- Yeah, pinging it now.

682
00:29:20,358 --> 00:29:22,193
I just got a signal.
It's in Flushing, Queens.

683
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,162
- Can you narrow in?
- Working on it.

684
00:29:24,229 --> 00:29:26,498
- Hey, guys, Sergei just texted
the same burner phone.

685
00:29:26,564 --> 00:29:29,367
"Cop was here. Getting worried.
Coming to you."

686
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:31,035
Then he told the guy
to turn off his phone,

687
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:32,971
said he was gonna do the same.

688
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:41,279
- Hey, so Sergei's on the move.

689
00:29:41,346 --> 00:29:42,480
Looks like he's going
to meet up with Viktor.

690
00:29:42,547 --> 00:29:44,082
- Do we still have eyes on him?
- No.

691
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:46,117
We lost him when
he jumped on the BQE.

692
00:29:46,184 --> 00:29:48,386
Got a BOLO out on his vehicle,
though, so...

693
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:52,257
- I just finished combing
through Ethan's phone.

694
00:29:52,323 --> 00:29:54,826
He called Sergei's burner
two minutes after

695
00:29:54,893 --> 00:29:57,362
he and the senator
talked to Maggie and OA.

696
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:03,501
- All right, grab up Ethan.
Bring him in.

697
00:30:03,568 --> 00:30:05,970
- Yeah.

698
00:30:09,941 --> 00:30:12,210
- All right, Ethan,
you got two choices.

699
00:30:12,277 --> 00:30:15,246
Either you come clean about
Addie, Sergei, the senator,

700
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:16,814
or we're gonna charge you.

701
00:30:16,881 --> 00:30:18,550
- Charge me with what?

702
00:30:18,616 --> 00:30:20,318
- Obstruction,
lying to a federal agent,

703
00:30:20,385 --> 00:30:21,686
and that's when
the fun really begins.

704
00:30:21,753 --> 00:30:24,289
Racketeering, kidnapping--
- Look, I already told you.

705
00:30:24,355 --> 00:30:27,392
I have no idea
who kidnapped Addie, or why.

706
00:30:27,458 --> 00:30:29,460
- I'm trying to help you,
but I need you to cooperate.

707
00:30:29,527 --> 00:30:31,296
- And I'm sorry, but
I am just as in the dark

708
00:30:31,362 --> 00:30:32,564
as you are on this.

709
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:34,299
- You are the senator's
chief of staff.

710
00:30:34,365 --> 00:30:36,201
It is your job to know.
You expect--

711
00:30:38,903 --> 00:30:41,472
- Ethan.

712
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:43,007
This is your last chance
to come clean,

713
00:30:43,074 --> 00:30:44,609
to tell us everything you know,

714
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:47,445
or we will move forward
with criminal charges.

715
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:58,990
- Okay, fine.

716
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:03,461
The senator told me

717
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:05,897
that the kidnappers
contacted him this morning

718
00:31:05,964 --> 00:31:08,466
about a ransom, but he told me
not to say anything.

719
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:09,867
It would endanger her life.

720
00:31:09,934 --> 00:31:12,203
And that is all I know.
I swear.

721
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:14,539
- Why did you call
Sergei Branislav?

722
00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:16,407
- Sergei?

723
00:31:16,474 --> 00:31:18,009
I never called that guy
in my life.

724
00:31:18,076 --> 00:31:20,111
I don't even have his number.
Why...

725
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:27,552
The senator asked to borrow
my phone after the meeting.

726
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:29,220
He told me
his battery was dead.

727
00:31:29,287 --> 00:31:30,922
- Okay. Do the senator
and Sergei know each other?

728
00:31:30,989 --> 00:31:32,323
Are they friends?

729
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:34,025
Have they had business dealings
with one another?

730
00:31:34,092 --> 00:31:36,060
- And why would Sergei take
Addie? What's his objective?

731
00:31:36,127 --> 00:31:37,996
- I don't know!
I have no idea, you guys.

732
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:41,032
If I did, I would tell you.

733
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:43,167
- Jubal,

734
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:45,403
I'd like to speak
to Ethan alone for a minute.

735
00:31:53,111 --> 00:31:55,079
You have one shot
to save yourself.

736
00:31:55,146 --> 00:31:57,248
One.
Do you understand me?

737
00:31:57,315 --> 00:32:00,184
- Why are you talking to me
like I'm a criminal?

738
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:02,120
- You're gonna wear a wire.

739
00:32:02,186 --> 00:32:04,589
- A wire? Seriously?
What are you talking about?

740
00:32:04,656 --> 00:32:06,624
- You're gonna
get the senator talking.

741
00:32:06,691 --> 00:32:08,526
You're gonna find out
why Addie was taken

742
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:10,194
and where we can find her.

743
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:11,562
- I understand that
you're upset. I do.

744
00:32:11,629 --> 00:32:13,464
But do you really expect me
to wear a wire

745
00:32:13,531 --> 00:32:15,600
and sell out Senator Hoffman--
- Yes!

746
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:18,603
That is exactly
what I expect you to do.

747
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:20,471
- I can't do that, Izzy.

748
00:32:20,538 --> 00:32:23,141
My career will be over.

749
00:32:23,207 --> 00:32:25,043
- But unemployment is
a whole hell of a lot better

750
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:26,411
than prison.

All right, put the phone down.
No more lawyers.

Not until you come clean

And I can get her to cover
for you, but I cannot do that

unless you tell me
exactly what happened.

Where's Addie?

From you?
You say the word, I'm gone.

I'd already be there.

That's good.

But what does Sergei have to do
with any of this?

Sergei...

784
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:51,229
Sergei thinks
I screwed him over.

He and I,

786
00:33:56,267 --> 00:33:57,802
we had a deal.

787
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:01,506
I told him about

788
00:34:01,572 --> 00:34:03,741
the federal redevelopment plan
in Ozone Park,

789
00:34:03,808 --> 00:34:05,476
that it was a done deal.

790
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:07,678
And out of pocket, he started
buying up adjacent land,

791
00:34:07,745 --> 00:34:10,281
and he was gonna kick me back
10% of the profits, but--

792
00:34:10,348 --> 00:34:13,351
- The redevelopment funds
already went to Staten Island.
