1
00:00:01,292 --> 00:00:02,419
- I swear it never stops.
I finish a memo,

2
00:00:02,502 --> 00:00:03,461
boom,
I need to write a brief.

3
00:00:03,545 --> 00:00:05,714
I finish the brief, boom,
I need to draft a motion.

4
00:00:05,797 --> 00:00:08,591
Then that jackass Snyder
tears it all apart.

5
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:10,552
He says my writing
is pedestrian,

6
00:00:10,635 --> 00:00:12,262
my research is outdated.

7
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:15,140
- Maybe it's time
to start looking around,

8
00:00:15,223 --> 00:00:17,600
find a smaller firm,
less pressure.

9
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:19,227
- Less money too.

10
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:21,563
- We don't have
to buy the condo.

11
00:00:21,646 --> 00:00:24,774
We can stay where we're at,
rent for a few more years.

12
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:27,318
- [distorted voice] Money
is the root of all evil,

13
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:29,738
the reason people suffer.

14
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:32,741
We must stop the exploitation
of the working man

15
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:34,534
and the pain we suffer.

16
00:00:34,617 --> 00:00:37,120
To do that,
we need to make them suffer,

17
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:39,581
make them feel our pain...

18
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:42,667
- What the hell?

19
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:44,669
Anyone call 911?

20
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:46,588
- Yeah, five minutes ago.

21
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:48,798
- Money is the root
of all evil...

22
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:51,342
[sirens wailing]

23
00:00:53,052 --> 00:00:55,013
- Gotta go to the other side!

24
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:58,016
[tense music]

25
00:00:58,099 --> 00:00:59,517
- Okay, let's go.
- Come on, girl.

26
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:01,436
- Okay, let's clear the area.
Go, go, go.

27
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:04,522
- Come on, Tess.
Here you go.

28
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:07,984
Hit. Hit.

29
00:01:08,067 --> 00:01:09,861
There you go, Tess.
Search.

30
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:11,446
Got something?
- [whines]

31
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:13,782
- Good girl.
Front tire.

32
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:15,283
- We must stop
the exploitation

33
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:17,744
of the working man
and the pain we suffer.

34
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:21,331
To do that,
we need to make them suffer.

35
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:23,041
- Just some idiot making
a political statement.

36
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:25,335
Look at this.
- Yeah, real fresh.

37
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:28,630
Rich people suck?
Never heard that before.

38
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:29,714
- Oh!

39
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:31,883
[bystanders screaming]

40
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:39,182
[tense music]

41
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,311
- So the car was parked
right there,

42
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:45,355
detonated at 7:27.
There's three dead.

43
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:47,357
Still trying to ID them.

44
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,316
- Techs know what kind
of bomb it was?

45
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:49,859
- Well, I mean the car
was blown to pieces.

46
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,361
We don't even know
the make and model yet.

47
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:53,530
- [sighs] Any idea
what this is all about?

48
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:56,074
- Right now,
it appears to be political.

49
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:59,244
There was anti-capitalist audio
playing down the block.

50
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:01,371
[police radio chatter]

51
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:02,997
Hey.
Any witnesses?

52
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:05,375
- Yeah, but they all
had their eyes and ears

53
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:06,709
glued to the gold car.

54
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:08,419
You know,
the whole Nashville thing.

55
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:10,380
- Which is probably why
they did it that way

56
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:11,714
and created a diversion

57
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,550
50 yards
from the actual crime scene.

58
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:17,554
- All while spreading
their gospel at the same time.

59
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:18,847
Okay.

60
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:22,225
- All right, people,
listen up!

61
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:24,185
We got the names
of our victims.

62
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:27,063
Number one, Mark Heller,
51, male, white,

63
00:02:27,146 --> 00:02:29,149
he worked
in commercial real estate.

64
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:31,401
Janet White, 37, female, Black.

65
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:33,611
She was a nurse
at Mt. Sinai Hospital.

66
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:37,073
And Benjamin Lopez, 26,
male Hispanic.

67
00:02:37,156 --> 00:02:38,741
He was a law student at NYU.

68
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,785
Let's dig into
these three people.

69
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:43,246
Was this a random attack,
or were these people targeted?

70
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:45,748
Was one of our victims
perchance the bomber?

71
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:48,334
I don't know.
Let's get to work.

72
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,253
Kelly, Elise,
let's make sure we pull

73
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:51,838
as much surveillance video
as possible

74
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:52,839
from around the bomb site

75
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:54,924
and the gold car
that had the audio recording.

76
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,635
Whoever planted that device
likely planted the bomb too.

77
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,345
- Hey, Jubal?
- Yeah?

78
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:00,722
- I have something interesting

79
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:02,098
across the street
from the site.

80
00:03:02,181 --> 00:03:04,225
- Great, put it up.
[beeps]

81
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:06,144
- There's a guy
pacing back and forth.

82
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:08,521
He seems real agitated,

83
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:09,606
but here's what's interesting:

84
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:12,442
he pulls his phone out at 7:27,
presses a button.

85
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:14,569
Let's presume for the moment
he presses send.

86
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:16,613
He then turns and hurries off
in the opposite direction.

87
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:17,947
Seconds later,
the bomb detonates.

88
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,490
- Can you get a clear shot
of his face?

89
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:22,118
- Running that
through facial rec now.

90
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:26,998
[suspenseful music]

91
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:28,791
Got it.
Nicholas Katz.

92
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:31,169
Poly-sci professor
at the New School.

93
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:32,670
There's three prior arrests

94
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:35,632
all in the last 18 months
and all for curfew violations.

95
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,717
- Okay, so he's an activist.
- And a member

96
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,177
of the Democratic Socialists
of America.

97
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,971
- Which would explain
the anti-capitalist recording.

98
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,098
Let's get an address.

99
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:46,309
[tense music]

100
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:47,936
- Green!

101
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:49,729
- [grunts]
- FBI!

102
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:52,774
Federal agents!

103
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:55,401
- Move!
Go, go, go, go!

104
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:58,321
- Put the gun down now!
- Drop the weapon!

105
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:00,490
- Oh, my God.
- Negative contact.

106
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:02,742
We're clear!
- Turn off the video game.

107
00:04:05,244 --> 00:04:07,205
Take off your headphones.

108
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:08,915
- Okay, what the hell
is going on?

109
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:10,375
- We need to talk to you
about the bomb

110
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:11,542
that exploded in Queens,

111
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:15,380
so keep your hands where
I can see them and do not move.

112
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:18,591
- I had nothing to do
with that bomb.

113
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:19,884
This is ridiculous.

114
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:21,636
- Well, we have you on video
near the site

115
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:23,721
pacing back and forth,
looking at your phone,

116
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:25,515
then seconds
before the bomb explodes,

117
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:27,350
you scurry off
in the opposite direction.

118
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:29,185
So it doesn't seem
that ridiculous to me.

119
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,478
- [sighs]

120
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:33,523
I was supposed
to meet my girlfriend--

121
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:35,692
my-ex girlfriend for dinner,

122
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,694
but she kept changing her mind.

123
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,529
She wanted to come,
she didn't wanna come,

124
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:41,197
so finally I just took off.

125
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,740
- While you were waiting
for your ex,

126
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:44,909
did you happen to see anyone
or anything suspicious?

127
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:47,704
- I did,
but I'm loathe to discuss it

128
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:50,873
because it's pure speculation.
- What does that mean?

129
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:53,209
- It means I saw a guy
standing on the corner

130
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,752
staring at a building.

131
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:57,755
He never moved,
he just stood there watching,

132
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:00,550
and then right before
the bomb went off,

133
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:01,634
he took off running.

134
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,845
- What did he look like?
- [sighs]

135
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:06,055
He appeared to be
Middle Eastern,

136
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,558
dark hair, dark skin.

137
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,393
- And you didn't tell anyone?

138
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:11,894
You didn't think
to call the police?

139
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,604
- I'm sorry,
what was I supposed to do?

140
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:15,440
Call 9-1-1 and say,

141
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:17,608
"Oh, I saw a suspicious
Middle Eastern dude

142
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:19,902
running down the street"?

143
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,071
- Yeah.

144
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,240
That's exactly what
you're supposed to do.

145
00:05:24,323 --> 00:05:26,617
- It's not 2001.

146
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:28,745
No more
"See Something, Say Something."

147
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,621
What if I were wrong?
Then what?

148
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:32,290
What, I become
the new posterchild

149
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:34,292
for anti-Muslim hate?

150
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,127
No, gracias.

151
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:37,545
- [sighs]

152
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:39,922
- Yup, back at you.
Hey, guys.

153
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,591
Hey, Rina, hey.

154
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:42,925
I-I didn't--
- Yeah.

155
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,762
I, uh, got back
to counterterrorism last week.

156
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,638
I was gonna text you, but...

157
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:50,767
- Yeah, no worries.
I'm glad you're back.

158
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:52,769
- Good to see you again,
Isobel.

159
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:55,980
- Yeah, you too.
- So where we at?

160
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:58,566
- We have a witness who saw
a Middle Eastern looking man

161
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:01,569
exit a black Chrysler,
loiter for a few moments,

162
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:03,529
and then took off
seconds before

163
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:06,115
that same
black Chrysler detonated.

164
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,493
- Yeah. We've been looking
for more surveillance video,

165
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:10,411
but so far,
we've been striking out.

166
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:12,038
- Well, we're striking out
over here too.

167
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:13,873
[sighs] No chatter, no intel,
but we're reaching out

168
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:15,958
to our various assets
to see what they know.

169
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,086
- Okay, great.
We'll work this together then.

170
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:19,921
- Yeah.
- Great, thanks.

171
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:23,174
Hey, I'm really glad
you're here.

172
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:24,759
- Yeah, I'm excited.

173
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:26,761
It's a new chapter, you know?

174
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:29,639
Kinda feels like
anything's possible.

175
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,641
- Right.

176
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,686
Y'all got something, huh?

177
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:38,648
- Bomb Techs were able to
cobble together the VIN number.

178
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:40,608
His car was reported stolen
yesterday afternoon

179
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:41,984
outside a hardware store
in Queens.

180
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,945
- And, Boss,
I pulled some camera footage.

181
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:45,655
There's the car.
Now watch this guy.

182
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:48,199
- Yeah, yeah.
Okay, any hits on facial rec?

183
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:49,617
- No, he never turns around.

184
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,702
- But he was holding
a full cup of coffee.

185
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:54,122
Steam, small sips,
limited head tilt.

186
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:56,499
Roast & Bean,
café three doors down.

187
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:57,500
I had them send over
credit card data

188
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,710
of all purchases within
15 minutes of the theft.

189
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:02,213
Only one Middle Eastern
surname on the list: Rob Salem.

190
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:05,007
I just ran it through the DMV
for approximate age, height...

191
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,717
- That looks like
a match to me.

192
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:09,178
Get the address over to
Scola and Tiffany--good work.

193
00:07:13,432 --> 00:07:15,226
- FBI.
We got a few questions.

194
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:17,061
- Hey.

195
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:18,855
Don't be stupid, Rob.

196
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,314
- I wasn't gonna.
- Mmm.

197
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:21,983
- What can I do for you?

198
00:07:23,442 --> 00:07:24,735
- You can tell us why

199
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:26,320
you stole a black Chrysler
yesterday.

200
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:27,905
- Excuse me?
- [scoffs]

201
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:30,032
And we got the whole thing
on video.

202
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,200
- You know,
if you're gonna steal a car,

203
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,535
you probably shouldn't
buy coffee first.

204
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:33,870
- And if you do,

205
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:36,080
you definitely shouldn't
pay with a credit card.

206
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,835
- Okay, yeah, I stole the car.

207
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:43,379
- What'd you do
after you stole it?

208
00:07:43,462 --> 00:07:44,589
- Drove it back to Astoria,

209
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:46,257
corner of 30th and 42nd.

210
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,926
Met the guy who asked me
to do it, got paid, went home.

211
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,636
- Who's the guy?
- Don't know.

212
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,762
- Oh, yeah, really?

213
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:52,930
That's the best
you could do for me?

214
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:55,725
- Look, man, I was just hanging
out smoking a cigarette.

215
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,101
This guy starts talking to me,

216
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:58,853
bums a smoke,
we start chatting.

217
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:00,479
Next thing I know he says,
"You steal me a car

218
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:03,065
in the next hour, I'll give you
1,000 bucks, cash."

219
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,775
It's crazy I know,
but it's the truth.

220
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:09,071
- What did he look like?

221
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,740
- Dark hair, brown eyes,

222
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:12,450
thin, about my height.

223
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:15,536
- Middle Eastern?
- [laughs]

224
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,247
I don't know.
Probably.

225
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,541
But he didn't have an accent
or anything.

226
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:21,959
- He say anything
about a bomb?

227
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:24,754
- What? No. Why would he say
anything about a bomb?

228
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:27,089
- 'Cause the car that you stole
blew up last night.

229
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,759
- The black Chrysler was the--
Aw, man.

230
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:31,761
I had no idea, I swear.

231
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:33,095
- Let's go, turn around.
Hands behind your back.

232
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,097
- [sighs]
- You know the drill.

233
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:38,935
- The Salem story checks out.
He doesn't appear to have ties

234
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,645
with any
known terrorist groups.

235
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:42,980
Just a local kid looking
to make some quick money.

236
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:45,316
- Do we have video of him
talking to the suspect?

237
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:46,943
- Uh, no, not yet.

238
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:47,818
- Where did this meeting
take place?

239
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:49,111
What part of Queens?

240
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,447
- Astoria,
right near 28th and Steinway.

241
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:53,574
Salem said
he had just had lunch

242
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:56,077
at a restaurant
called Tannourine.

243
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,329
- I know it.
Syrian restaurant.

244
00:08:58,412 --> 00:08:59,914
A guy named Hassan Ali
owns it.

245
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:01,540
We've been monitoring him
for a few years.

246
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:04,001
[keys clacking]

247
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:06,170
- Yeah, so 5'11",
thin, dark hair.

248
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:08,756
Matches the general description
Salem gave.

249
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:09,966
- I mean,
it's not much to go on.

250
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,592
- Yeah, but it's something.

251
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:12,802
We've got a CI
in the neighborhood.

252
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:15,638
I'll get on that right away.
- Great.

253
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:18,808
- No, sorry. I don't know
anything about that.

254
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:20,977
I haven't heard anybody
talking about it either.

255
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,312
- Do you know Hassan Ali?
- No.

256
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,523
- Got a restaurant
at Steinway and 28th

257
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:28,192
called Tannourine.
- So?

258
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:31,487
- We think he might've been
involved in the recent bombing.

259
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:33,656
- Which means we need you
to start hanging out there.

260
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,700
All right, start talking
to people, taking photos.

261
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,787
- You need to speak
to my attorney first.

262
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,831
- Excuse me?

263
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:43,499
- Look, I'm tired of the way
you guys are treating me.

264
00:09:43,582 --> 00:09:44,917
All right, every time I--

265
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:47,044
- What the hell
are you talking about?

266
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:50,339
- Look, from now on,
if you want to talk to me,

267
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,675
speak with my attorney first.

268
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,267
- This guy for real?

269
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:07,356
"Mona Nazari."
Anybody know her?

270
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:13,362
- Yeah.
That's...my girlfriend.

271
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:21,074
OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN
from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn

272
00:10:23,622 --> 00:10:25,166
- She left the U.S. Attorney's
Office two months ago

273
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:26,584
and opened up
her own legal clinic,

274
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:28,419
so it is possible
she's representing him.

275
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:30,880
- That's great, but I just
don't know what the hell

276
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,214
she's trying to do for Vega.

277
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,342
We made a deal with him
two years ago

278
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:36,302
after he got busted
for armed robbery.

279
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:37,595
On top of that,

280
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:39,680
he was undocumented,
facing deportation.

281
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:42,016
NYPD reached out,
thought he may be interested,

282
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:43,225
so we made an arrangement.

283
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:44,935
- Okay, has he delivered
any valuable intel?

284
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:47,063
- Some, but nothing
that's led to any arrests,

285
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:48,564
so he owes us.

286
00:10:48,647 --> 00:10:50,274
He doesn't get
to just walk away

287
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:51,776
now that we really need him.

288
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:55,654
Look, what I'm saying is,
girlfriend or no girlfriend,

289
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,698
if Vega doesn't live up
to end of the bargain,

290
00:10:57,782 --> 00:10:59,909
he'll be back on a plane
to Damascus real soon.

291
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:05,247
- [sighs]
All right.

292
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,917
- I can't believe you guys are
still trying to pressure Vega.

293
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,959
- Why do you say that?

294
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:11,420
He's undocumented,
got pinched for armed robbery.

295
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:14,256
- He stole $30 worth of food
from 7-Eleven

296
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,092
and had a small knife
in his pocket.

297
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:17,468
If he were white,

298
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:19,929
he would've gotten
a gentle slap on the wrist.

299
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:22,473
But he's Muslim from Syria.
Means he's valuable.

300
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:25,017
So you guys leveraged him.

301
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:29,438
"Spy on your friends, and we'll
let you stay in America."

302
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:32,441
- Maybe, but that's
kind of irrelevant now.

303
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,568
He either cooperates,
or he's gonna get deported.

304
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:35,945
- It's not that simple.

305
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:39,156
- It is that simple.
Three people just died.

306
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,908
- That's not Vega's problem.

307
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:44,537
- Mona, I don't want
to fight about this.

308
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,288
Okay? I'm just trying
to do my job.

309
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:47,957
- Your job.

310
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,043
Being a loyal Fed no matter
what the circumstances.

That's not fair.

- What are you talking about?

316
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:10,312
- If you guys agree to make
Vega a permanent legal resident

317
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:13,315
after this operation's over,
he'll cooperate.

318
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:17,778
If not, he's not stepping foot
near that restaurant.

319
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:24,827
- You sure he would agree
to something like that?

320
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,662
- Talked to him
ten minutes ago.

321
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:28,998
Told him he should take
advantage of this opportunity.

Try exploiting the people
exploiting him.

328
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,020
to a few suspicious
foreign nationals

329
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:52,146
about a month ago.

330
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:55,357
One of the men's cousins
is a known terrorist in Syria.

331
00:12:58,152 --> 00:12:59,403
Yeah, I get it.

00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:01,489
I know, it's not a lot,
but it's all we got.

333
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:06,243
I assume you've spoken
to his lawyer

334
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:07,745
and resolved all this?
- I did.

335
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:08,871
She said he is willing
to cooperate

336

permanent legal residence

338

the deal?

339
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:16,545
Are you kidding me?

340
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,672
- Well, that's what
his lawyer said,

341
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:20,883
so with all due respect,
it kind of is what it is.

342
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,762
- I think we should go for it.

343
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:27,848
We need all the help
we can get.

344

- Okay.

345
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:35,064
Hassan Ali
is our ultimate target.

346
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:37,441
He owns the restaurant, and he
spends a lot of time there too.

347
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:38,776
- Do you have any evidence

348
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:40,194
that he's actually involved
in any of this,

349
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:41,403
or are you just speculating?

350
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:42,655
- We never said that Hassan
was guilty.

351
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:44,281
We just said that
he might be involved.

352
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:46,075
- Based on what?

353
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:47,952
- Based on our intelligence.

354
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:49,954
- Do you have anything
more specific than that?

355

356
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:53,749
someone who fits the general
description of Hassan

357
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:56,293
offered a guy 1,000 bucks
to steal a black Chrysler

358
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:57,753
that was used in the bombing.

359
00:13:57,836 --> 00:14:00,089

a half block away

360
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:01,465
from his restaurant,

361
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:03,592
so we're not just picking names
out of a hat.

362

- That street gets
a lot of foot traffic.

363
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:07,263
All right, it's probably
just a coincidence.

364
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,974
- Well, for now, let's pretend
it's not a coincidence, okay?

365
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:12,309
All we can do
is find information

- That's good.

He works at the restaurant.
He's a waiter.

- Yeah, but he's
not a terrorist.

No, this isn't hard.

Because I'm Muslim.

Can't rule him out either.

629
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:27,192
- Right.

630
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:31,780
- We tried to put Vega
back into play, but--

631
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:34,407
- But he thought that Hassan
might have made him.

632
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:37,744
But the good news is
that he got Hassan talking,

633
00:25:37,827 --> 00:25:39,871
and we were able
to identify an opportunity.

634
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:43,291
- What are you talking about?
- Well, Hassan said that he has

635
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:44,960
a very sophisticated
surveillance system

636
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:47,629
at his restaurant, lots of
cameras pointing outwards,

637
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:48,922
so maybe one of those cameras
caught the conversation

638
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:53,301
between Salem and whoever gave
him $1,000 to steal that car.

for a warrant.

for a sneak and peek.

642
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:03,687
- It's risky,

643
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:06,815
but it might make more sense
to use Vega.

644
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:10,402

but he's too anxious.

645

We don't think
he can pull this one off.

All right, go for it.

648

Maggie,

649
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,213

is Hassan's security system.

650

- I agree with that, but--

651
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:33,383
- And the only reason that we
have Hassan's security system

652
00:26:33,466 --> 00:26:34,592
is because of Vega.
