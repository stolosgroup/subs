00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:10,175
Raves, rampant drug use,
and run by this guy,

324
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:12,975
Sam Sloan, who Tiff and Scola
just arrested.

325
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:16,220
He's an up-and-coming
nightlife impresario of sorts,

326
00:14:16,304 --> 00:14:19,678
has a half dozen citations
for SLA licensing violations.

327
00:14:19,763 --> 00:14:21,158
Otherwise, clean.

328
00:14:21,242 --> 00:14:23,093
We have any evidence that
Mateo was there last night?

329
00:14:23,177 --> 00:14:24,261
Yes.

330
00:14:24,345 --> 00:14:27,765
Here's Sam greeting Mateo
at 8:02.

331
00:14:28,013 --> 00:14:30,645
It's lifted from their
members only area.

332
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:32,450
Looks like more than
a business transaction.

333
00:14:32,654 --> 00:14:34,438
Yeah, as the crow flies,

334
00:14:34,522 --> 00:14:36,640
it's 11 miles from the rave
to the crime scene,

335
00:14:36,724 --> 00:14:38,868
where we can place
our shooter at 9:05,

336
00:14:38,953 --> 00:14:40,768
so it's still possible
he's our killer.

337
00:14:40,853 --> 00:14:43,505
And he's in the gang
that wanted Kiko dead,

338
00:14:43,589 --> 00:14:45,507
plus we have a
lot of bargaining power

339
00:14:45,591 --> 00:14:47,751
with the gun and the cocaine
we found on him.

340
00:14:48,007 --> 00:14:50,169
All right, well,
let's exploit that leverage.

341
00:14:50,254 --> 00:14:51,719
Let's take a run at Sam.

342
00:14:53,024 --> 00:14:56,077
Felony possession of cocaine
with intent to distribute.

343
00:14:56,169 --> 00:14:58,759
That is a real charge, Sam.
You can do time behind that.

344
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,425
I'm not a real drug dealer.
I sell to my friends.

345
00:15:02,571 --> 00:15:04,563
Mm, unlike your boyfriend,
Mateo?

346
00:15:07,426 --> 00:15:09,261
We saw you two on video.

347
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:12,193
Yeah, we're together.

348
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:14,396
But you can't tell anyone,
for real.

349
00:15:14,481 --> 00:15:16,268
The gang finds out he's gay,
they'll kill him,

350
00:15:16,352 --> 00:15:18,423
and they'll probably
kill me too.

351
00:15:18,767 --> 00:15:20,818
The gang doesn't know
that he's gay?

352
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:23,478
No, he got involved
when he was a kid.

353
00:15:23,563 --> 00:15:25,188
He's not like them.

354
00:15:25,499 --> 00:15:26,954
He's not a gangster.

355
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,237
All right, did he mention
anything last night

356
00:15:32,321 --> 00:15:33,238
about a murder?

357
00:15:33,323 --> 00:15:34,800
Kid named Kiko?

358
00:15:34,951 --> 00:15:37,300
And what about a young woman
named Marisol?

359
00:15:37,464 --> 00:15:40,315
He doesn't talk about
any of that, not with me.

360
00:15:40,931 --> 00:15:44,175
I keep telling him that
he needs to start a new life

361
00:15:45,238 --> 00:15:46,573
He's afraid.

362
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:49,737
Okay, so last night,

363
00:15:49,822 --> 00:15:51,878
you guys got together
around 7:00 p.m.?

364
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:54,553
- How long did he stay with you?
- The whole night.

365
00:15:55,065 --> 00:15:56,823
- You can prove that?
- Yeah.

366
00:15:57,065 --> 00:15:58,472
I have photos on my phone
of me and him,

367
00:15:58,556 --> 00:15:59,657
partying, hanging out.

368
00:16:01,834 --> 00:16:02,937
Okay.

369
00:16:04,937 --> 00:16:06,588
Good news, Mateo.

370
00:16:06,673 --> 00:16:08,725
You're not going down
for a double homicide.

371
00:16:09,019 --> 00:16:11,211
Bad news...

372
00:16:11,684 --> 00:16:13,501
it's a felony
to lie to the FBI,

373
00:16:13,624 --> 00:16:15,709
as well as distribution
of cocaine

374

of an unregistered handgun.

Jose Florial,
you're under arrest.

812
00:38:38,359 --> 00:38:40,143
We found the murder weapon
on Jose,

813
00:38:40,227 --> 00:38:41,645
and we were able to pull
incriminating texts

814
00:38:41,729 --> 00:38:44,281
off his phone,
so he is going away.

815
00:38:44,365 --> 00:38:45,782
We're still gonna
need your testimony.

816
00:38:45,866 --> 00:38:47,692
But in the meantime,
marshals are gonna set you

817
00:38:47,776 --> 00:38:50,320
and Sam up with everything.
New identities, new place...

818
00:38:50,565 --> 00:38:52,656
You keeping your word.
I ain't used to that.

819
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:54,157
Well, you helped us out.

820
00:38:54,241 --> 00:38:56,221
I'm glad we could
return the favor.

821
00:38:57,017 --> 00:38:58,668
And trust me,

822
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:00,940
I know it's not easy
to start over.

823

Hey, Maggie.

824
00:39:08,892 --> 00:39:10,828
It was about once a minute.

825
00:39:12,507 --> 00:39:14,884
How many times a day
I wish I didn't have to hide.

826
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:19,674
Not every day we get
a chance to start fresh.

827

Hey, Maggie.

829
00:39:37,017 --> 00:39:39,869
Okay, um, about earlier.

830
00:39:39,993 --> 00:39:41,271
If you shot Jose down there,

831
00:39:41,355 --> 00:39:43,493
you would have had to go see
the shooting team.

832
00:39:43,924 --> 00:39:45,564
What does that have
to do with anything?

833
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:49,275
Come on, Maggie,
I know that...

834
00:39:51,422 --> 00:39:53,807
I know that you're not
completely yourself right now,

835
00:39:53,892 --> 00:39:56,743
and I thought maybe
they could see it too.

836
00:39:56,946 --> 00:39:58,508
Okay, hold on a second.

837
00:40:02,865 --> 00:40:04,696
I open up to you.

838
00:40:05,132 --> 00:40:09,079
Okay, I trust you as my partner
to tell you that I'm nervous,

839
00:40:09,913 --> 00:40:11,417
that I have first day jitters,
and now you're

840
00:40:11,501 --> 00:40:12,869
gonna use it against me?

If the bureau found
unsanctioned medication

842
00:40:15,376 --> 00:40:17,229
in your blood,
you would be benched.

843
00:40:17,314 --> 00:40:19,189
I know what the protocol is.

844
00:40:20,661 --> 00:40:21,955
I said to you that
I would tell you

845
00:40:22,039 --> 00:40:24,361
if I took a pill, if I even
thought about taking a pill.

846

Okay, well, then I am sorry
for trying to protect you.

No, I don't need that.
