1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:03,261
Cheers.

2
00:00:03,784 --> 00:00:05,220
Can we get another
round of martinis

3
00:00:05,245 --> 00:00:07,882
when you get a second?
- No, no more for me.

4
00:00:07,907 --> 00:00:08,984
- Oh, come on.

5
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,115
It took me six months
to get you here.

6
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:12,837
Stay for one more.

7
00:00:12,862 --> 00:00:15,250
- You're right.
It's been too long.

8
00:00:15,275 --> 00:00:18,054
It's just work's been
crazy, and Luke's

9
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:20,690
starting school this year.
- Already?

10
00:00:20,715 --> 00:00:22,718
I swear, the last
time I saw him,

11
00:00:22,743 --> 00:00:24,029
he was still a baby.

12
00:00:24,054 --> 00:00:26,491
- Oh, he is a full
little person now.

13
00:00:26,516 --> 00:00:28,060
I had to put the camera
back in his room.

14
00:00:28,084 --> 00:00:29,538
He's been getting up in
the middle of the night

15
00:00:29,562 --> 00:00:30,934
and getting out all
his books or toys.

16
00:00:30,958 --> 00:00:32,029
- Oh.

17
00:00:32,054 --> 00:00:34,138
- Of course, the
one night I go out,

18
00:00:34,163 --> 00:00:36,121
he is out like a light.

19
00:00:36,379 --> 00:00:38,947
- He is getting so big.

20
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:40,843
- I know.

21
00:00:40,962 --> 00:00:42,311
- Who is that?

22
00:00:46,075 --> 00:00:47,903
- I... uh...

23
00:00:47,928 --> 00:00:50,235
I... I don't know.

24
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:52,436
Quick, give me your phone.

25
00:01:03,006 --> 00:01:04,485
- Hello?

26
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:06,849
- Carmen, there's a
man in Luke's room.

27
00:01:06,936 --> 00:01:07,937
- What?
- There's a man.

28
00:01:08,024 --> 00:01:09,765
I can see him on the camera.

29
00:01:16,511 --> 00:01:18,600
Can you see him?

30
00:01:21,342 --> 00:01:22,821
- Carmen.

31
00:01:40,255 --> 00:01:42,214
- Hey.
- Hey.

32
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:44,676
- You with me tonight?
- I guess so.

33
00:01:44,722 --> 00:01:46,115
- You doing OK?

34
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,781
OA said that you
went to the doctor.

35
00:01:47,806 --> 00:01:51,114
You weren't feeling well?
- I'm fine.

36
00:01:51,139 --> 00:01:53,896
- The intruder broke
in around 10:10 p.m.,

37
00:01:53,921 --> 00:01:55,764
broke that glass, and came
through that back door.

38
00:01:55,788 --> 00:01:57,923
- OK, are there any
external cameras out there?

39
00:01:57,948 --> 00:01:59,872
- No, the house has
an alarm system,

40
00:01:59,897 --> 00:02:01,519
but the kid's mother,
Liza Peters, she was out,

41
00:02:01,543 --> 00:02:02,888
So it hadn't been activated yet.

42
00:02:02,913 --> 00:02:03,958
- OK.

43
00:02:03,983 --> 00:02:05,522
- The abductor comes
through the kitchen

44
00:02:05,546 --> 00:02:08,331
and goes up these
stairs, kills the nanny,

45
00:02:08,454 --> 00:02:10,935
and takes five-year-old
Luke Peters from his bed.

46
00:02:11,218 --> 00:02:14,134
- OK, what do we know
about the victim?

47
00:02:14,221 --> 00:02:17,093
- Not much. Carmen
Hernandez, 34.

48
00:02:17,118 --> 00:02:18,772
Lived in Queens,
worked full-time

49
00:02:18,797 --> 00:02:20,233
as the family's nanny.

50
00:02:20,258 --> 00:02:22,662
Crazy thing is Mom knew
the guy was in the house

51
00:02:22,687 --> 00:02:24,864
before she did, saw it
on the baby monitor.

52
00:02:24,982 --> 00:02:27,375
- This thing recording?
- No.

53
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,881
Apparently, it just has
a live feed, no playback.

54
00:02:30,086 --> 00:02:32,828
- OK, where's the mom?

55
00:02:33,196 --> 00:02:37,679
- I couldn't see much. The
man was across the room.

56
00:02:37,766 --> 00:02:39,985
- OK, do you remember
how tall he was

57
00:02:40,072 --> 00:02:41,683
or what color hair he had?

58
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:45,600
- He was wearing a
black tracksuit jacket.

59
00:02:45,687 --> 00:02:47,471
I'm sorry. That's
all I could see.

60
00:02:47,496 --> 00:02:48,844
- That's OK.

61
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:51,220
- Just you and Luke living here?

62
00:02:51,245 --> 00:02:53,594
What about his father?
He in the picture?

63
00:02:53,619 --> 00:02:55,063
- When he can be.
We're not together.

64
00:02:55,088 --> 00:02:56,154
He lives in London.

65
00:02:56,179 --> 00:02:57,694
- So you two have a
cordial relationship?

66
00:02:57,718 --> 00:02:59,198
- Yes, we're good friends.

67
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:01,800
- So there is no
chance that he...?

68
00:03:01,825 --> 00:03:03,357
- No.

69
00:03:03,885 --> 00:03:08,989
We had our differences, but,
no, John's a good person.

70
00:03:09,014 --> 00:03:10,950
He'd never do
anything like this.

71
00:03:10,975 --> 00:03:13,108
- Can you think of
anybody that might?

72
00:03:13,133 --> 00:03:15,206
- Anyone who'd shoot my
nanny and kidnap my son?

73
00:03:15,231 --> 00:03:16,519
No.

74
00:03:17,622 --> 00:03:19,711
I can't believe this
is really happening.

75
00:03:20,102 --> 00:03:23,541
- I know. I'm...
I'm really sorry.

76
00:03:23,628 --> 00:03:26,239
- OK, so the first
thing we're gonna need

77
00:03:26,264 --> 00:03:27,627
is a sample of Luke's DNA,

78
00:03:27,652 --> 00:03:29,199
so if you have a
toothbrush, a comb...

79
00:03:29,224 --> 00:03:30,878
- Yeah, sure.

80
00:03:30,903 --> 00:03:33,151
- And we're also going to need
to monitor your phone lines.

81
00:03:33,175 --> 00:03:34,414
Is that OK?

82
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:36,303
- Yeah, of course,
whatever you need.

83
00:03:36,328 --> 00:03:38,870
I just want my son back.

84
00:03:39,785 --> 00:03:41,004
- All right, morning, folks.

85
00:03:41,029 --> 00:03:42,161
On the docket today,

86
00:03:42,186 --> 00:03:43,752
we've got a regular
horror story,

87
00:03:43,923 --> 00:03:45,664
every parent's worst nightmare.

88
00:03:45,689 --> 00:03:47,909
Five-year-old Luke Peters
was taken from his house

89
00:03:47,934 --> 00:03:49,821
a little after 10:00
p.m. last night,

90
00:03:49,846 --> 00:03:51,408
which means he's been
missing for eight hours.

91
00:03:51,432 --> 00:03:53,017
We have no footage,
no witnesses,

92
00:03:53,042 --> 00:03:55,349
except the mother, who
got a glimpse of the perp

93
00:03:55,374 --> 00:03:56,571
on the nanny cam.

94
00:03:56,596 --> 00:03:58,773
Not a lot of detail
'cause he was in the dark,

95
00:03:58,994 --> 00:04:00,822
which is precisely where we are,

96
00:04:00,847 --> 00:04:02,783
so let's get to work and
start shedding some light

97
00:04:02,807 --> 00:04:05,287
on this, yeah?
Thank you very much.

98
00:04:05,451 --> 00:04:07,634
Kelly, light me up.
- Ballistics report.

99
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,390
Bullets that killed
the nanny, Carmen,

100
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:11,302
were from a 9-millimeter,
but there's no match

101
00:04:11,327 --> 00:04:12,719
in the system.
- Right, OK.

102
00:04:12,744 --> 00:04:14,186
So we need agents
going door-to-door

103
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:15,392
in the Peters' neighborhood.

104
00:04:15,417 --> 00:04:16,721
Ethan, you want to
take care of that?

105
00:04:16,745 --> 00:04:17,798
Make sure you dig into

106
00:04:17,823 --> 00:04:19,782
the local sex offender
registry, yeah?

107
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,735
- So what do we know
about the family?

108
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,112
- Luke lives with the mother,
Liza Peters, in Ditmas Park.

109
00:04:25,144 --> 00:04:26,918
She's a partner at
a consulting firm

110
00:04:26,943 --> 00:04:28,902
in Midtown, JBD Management.

111
00:04:28,927 --> 00:04:31,538
- And what about the father?
- John Bryant, 43.

112
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:33,914
He works for a private
equity firm in London.

113
00:04:34,181 --> 00:04:36,748
- So he lives in London, and
the wife lives in New York?

114
00:04:36,773 --> 00:04:38,123
- That is because
they're divorced

115
00:04:38,147 --> 00:04:39,110
but on good terms.

116
00:04:39,135 --> 00:04:41,579
He seems happily remarried
to a woman named Andrea.

117
00:04:41,604 --> 00:04:43,148
- Yeah, he's actually
on his way to New York.

118
00:04:43,172 --> 00:04:44,518
He should be here in
about seven hours or so.

119
00:04:44,542 --> 00:04:46,260
- All right, so let's
assume Luke's abduction

120
00:04:46,284 --> 00:04:48,524
is not connected to the father.
What do we know about Liza?

121
00:04:48,548 --> 00:04:51,831
Does she have any skeletons
in the closet, any enemies?

122
00:04:51,856 --> 00:04:53,040
- Doesn't appear that way.

123
00:04:53,065 --> 00:04:55,071
We've been through her
phone records, financials.

124
00:04:55,096 --> 00:04:56,576
No red flags popping anywhere.

125
00:04:56,601 --> 00:04:57,791
I mean, if it's a
pure money grab,

126
00:04:57,815 --> 00:04:59,271
there are much better
targets out there.

127
00:04:59,295 --> 00:05:00,697
- Plus, we haven't seen
anything in the way

128
00:05:00,721 --> 00:05:02,636
of a ransom demand...
Not yet, anyway.

129
00:05:02,713 --> 00:05:04,976
- So why take this little
boy? What's the endgame?

130
00:05:05,001 --> 00:05:06,071
- Thanks.

131
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,298
ERT just pulled
three clean prints

132
00:05:08,323 --> 00:05:10,369
from the back door
of Liza's house.

133
00:05:10,394 --> 00:05:12,526
- Let there be light.

134
00:05:12,551 --> 00:05:16,251
- Thanks. Hey, Liza?

135
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:19,576
Hi, do you mind if we
ask you a few questions?

136
00:05:19,601 --> 00:05:22,168
- Yeah, I was just...

137
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:30,556
- So we found three fingerprints

138
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:34,860
from the abductor's entrance...
Yours, Carmen's, and this guy,

139
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:36,683
Thomas Mitchum.

140
00:05:40,756 --> 00:05:42,280
- I take it you know who he is.

141
00:05:42,305 --> 00:05:44,263
- Yeah, that's
Carmen's ex-boyfriend.

142
00:05:44,288 --> 00:05:47,161
He's a drug addict and a thief.

143
00:05:47,186 --> 00:05:49,360
He stole my watch
three months ago,

144
00:05:49,385 --> 00:05:51,149
which I tried to overlook
because of Carmen.

145
00:05:51,174 --> 00:05:53,091
- OK, are him and
Carmen still in touch?

146
00:05:53,116 --> 00:05:54,235
- I don't think so.

147
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,845
- So there would be
no legitimate reason

148
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:57,384
for him to be here last night?
- No.

149
00:05:57,409 --> 00:05:58,868
I made it clear to Carmen

150
00:05:58,893 --> 00:06:00,018
I never wanted to see him again,

151
00:06:00,042 --> 00:06:02,329
and I sure as hell didn't
want him near my son.

152
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:05,332
Oh, my God. Thomas took Luke

153
00:06:05,357 --> 00:06:07,838
- It's OK. It's OK.

154
00:06:07,996 --> 00:06:11,043
- Any idea where Thomas
Mitchum might be staying?

155
00:06:11,068 --> 00:06:14,290
- Yes, I dropped
Carmen off there once.

156
00:06:14,505 --> 00:06:16,986
He was living at
his aunt's house.

157
00:06:17,011 --> 00:06:19,927
It was right near the
cemetery in Maspeth.

158
00:06:27,706 --> 00:06:29,448
- In position.

159
00:06:29,473 --> 00:06:30,899
- Copy that, stand by.

160
00:06:35,948 --> 00:06:38,429
- We're gonna enter as
quietly as possible.

161
00:06:38,454 --> 00:06:40,549
We have no way of confirming
that Mitchum is working alone,

162
00:06:40,573 --> 00:06:43,267
and we do not want to alert
anyone to our presence.

163
00:06:43,292 --> 00:06:45,990
We make a sound, it could
get this kid killed.

164
00:06:46,035 --> 00:06:48,429
- I've got eyes on Mitchum.

165
00:06:48,462 --> 00:06:51,552
He's moving around the
front of the house.

166
00:06:51,584 --> 00:06:52,890
Southeast corner.

167
00:07:13,734 --> 00:07:15,866
- All right, Mitchum is
headed to the back room.

168
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:40,451
I think he heard you.

169
00:07:40,757 --> 00:07:42,368
Mitchum is headed your way.

170
00:07:44,862 --> 00:07:48,642
- Mitchum, don't
move! Hands up.

171
00:07:48,891 --> 00:07:50,466
We got Mitchum in
the living room.

172
00:07:53,267 --> 00:07:54,921
- Hey!

173
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:00,151
Hey.
- Luke?

174
00:08:00,176 --> 00:08:02,570
- Freeze! I said drop it.

175
00:08:02,595 --> 00:08:04,290
Hands up. On your feet now.

176
00:08:04,315 --> 00:08:05,751
Back up towards me.

177
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:08,214
- Luke? Hey, buddy?

178
00:08:08,426 --> 00:08:10,515
Luke?
- Back up.

179
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:16,316
- Luke? Hey, buddy?

180
00:08:16,357 --> 00:08:18,185
It's okay. You can come out.

181
00:08:20,338 --> 00:08:21,687
- Glock 19, 9-millimeter.

182
00:08:21,712 --> 00:08:23,975
- I can explain.
- Anyone else in the house?

183
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,557
- No. What the hell
is this?- Come on.

184
00:08:26,143 --> 00:08:27,551
- Luke?

185
00:08:30,074 --> 00:08:31,815
Hey! He's not here.

186
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,948
The kid's not here.
Mitchum, where is he?

187
00:08:33,973 --> 00:08:36,018
Where the hell is Luke Peters?

188
00:08:43,892 --> 00:08:45,970
- I don't know where Luke
is. I didn't take him.

189
00:08:45,995 --> 00:08:48,174
Seriously, what would
I do with a kid?

190
00:08:48,446 --> 00:08:50,927
- We know that you
were there last night.

191
00:08:55,846 --> 00:08:58,675
Is that Carmen?
- Yes.

192
00:08:58,792 --> 00:09:01,316
- What happened?
- Why don't you tell us?

193
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:02,734
- What do you mean?

194
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:04,282
- We found your
prints at the scene.

195
00:09:04,307 --> 00:09:06,266
Then today, we find
you with a gun, so...

196
00:09:06,304 --> 00:09:08,654
- No, I didn't kill
Carmen. I loved her.

197
00:09:08,702 --> 00:09:10,399
- I have three domestic
violence reports

198
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:13,198
that say otherwise.
- That was a long time ago.

199
00:09:15,729 --> 00:09:18,819
Look, I'm not perfect,
but I didn't kill her.

200
00:09:21,321 --> 00:09:24,174
- So what happened? Why
were you there last night?

201
00:09:24,199 --> 00:09:26,933
- We was just hanging out,
like Carmen and I always do.

202
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:30,310
We...
- Like you always do?

203
00:09:30,335 --> 00:09:33,555
- I wait till she puts Luke
to bed, then I go over,

204
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:35,245
then I leave before
Liza gets back.

205
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:36,814
- I thought you and Carmen
weren't dating anymore.

206
00:09:36,838 --> 00:09:38,230
- Says who?
- Liza.

207
00:09:38,255 --> 00:09:39,430
- Well, she's wrong.

208
00:09:41,711 --> 00:09:45,193
Carmen probably just
didn't want her to know.

209
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,412
- So how late were
you there last night?

210
00:09:47,437 --> 00:09:49,004
- I don't know. A
little after 10:00.

211
00:09:49,308 --> 00:09:51,609
- OK, did you notice anyone
else in the neighborhood

212
00:09:51,634 --> 00:09:53,897
when you left?
- No.

213
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:57,434
There was a car.

214
00:09:57,459 --> 00:09:59,957
It was parked out at the curb
about a block from the house.

215
00:10:01,082 --> 00:10:02,514
Guys were just sitting in it.

216
00:10:02,539 --> 00:10:03,949
- What kind of car?

217
00:10:03,974 --> 00:10:07,978
- I don't know, um,
it was a black sedan,

218
00:10:08,003 --> 00:10:11,920
but I remember that their
left tail light was out.

219
00:10:12,262 --> 00:10:13,936
I thought about going
and telling them,

220
00:10:13,961 --> 00:10:15,440
but it was already so late.

221
00:10:22,062 --> 00:10:24,746
- How are we doing, Elise?
- Still looking.

222
00:10:24,771 --> 00:10:26,764
There's no cameras near
where the car was parked.

223
00:10:26,789 --> 00:10:28,268
- Ballistics from Mitchum's gun

224
00:10:28,293 --> 00:10:29,968
weren't a match for the
bullets that killed Carmen.

225
00:10:29,992 --> 00:10:31,318
It looks like we're
back to square one.

226
00:10:31,342 --> 00:10:33,225
- Hey, I got video
of the black sedan.

227
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,191
- Yeah.

228
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:36,115
This is at 9:58 p.m.,

229
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:38,308
12 minutes before
Liza's 911 call.

230
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:40,855
- Yeah, can we run those plates?

231
00:10:41,255 --> 00:10:43,301
- They're bogus, come back
to a Toyota Highlander.

232
00:10:43,326 --> 00:10:44,550
- OK. So what?

233
00:10:44,575 --> 00:10:45,605
Rewind it.

234
00:10:47,264 --> 00:10:50,179
All right, so it looks like
there's four, maybe five guys.

235
00:10:50,204 --> 00:10:52,989
Can you see if you can get
a shot of the driver or no?

236
00:10:54,832 --> 00:10:56,542
OK, black hat, track suit.

237
00:10:56,567 --> 00:10:58,388
It's got to be the guy
Liza saw on the nanny cam.

238
00:10:58,412 --> 00:11:00,004
- I want IDs on
everybody in that car.

239
00:11:00,029 --> 00:11:02,184
- OK, I'll try, but most
of them are in the shadow.

240
00:11:02,209 --> 00:11:03,341
- Can you track them
back any further,

241
00:11:03,365 --> 00:11:04,961
try to get a better angle?
- Yeah, we're looking.

242
00:11:04,985 --> 00:11:06,715
We're looking.

243
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,403
- All right, come on, come
on, come on, let's go.

244
00:11:08,427 --> 00:11:10,605
What are we seeing?

245
00:11:11,011 --> 00:11:12,129
- I got 'em.
- Yeah?

246
00:11:12,154 --> 00:11:14,496
- They stopped at a food
cart half a mile back.

247
00:11:14,987 --> 00:11:16,547
Still not a great
look into the vehicle,

248
00:11:16,572 --> 00:11:18,270
but I think I can
get the driver.

249
00:11:18,295 --> 00:11:20,696
- Yeah, hey, better an egg
today than a hen tomorrow.

250
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:22,793
Come on. Let's see, come on.

251
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:27,761
Boom.
- OK.

252
00:11:27,786 --> 00:11:30,049
- OK, eyes up, people.

253
00:11:30,167 --> 00:11:32,909
- Akhmad Petrov, 43-year-old
Chechen national.

254
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:34,874
He's on Interpol's
most wanted list,

255
00:11:34,899 --> 00:11:36,031
runs some group called

256
00:11:36,056 --> 00:11:37,416
the Chechen
Revolutionary Regiment.

257
00:11:37,441 --> 00:11:38,801
- Yeah, that's a fancy name

258
00:11:38,826 --> 00:11:41,238
for a terrorist organization.
These guys are legit.

259
00:11:41,263 --> 00:11:44,223
They're responsible for
several high-profile bombings

260
00:11:44,248 --> 00:11:46,424
and political assassinations
throughout Eastern Europe.

261
00:11:46,727 --> 00:11:48,314
- So what the hell do a
bunch of Chechen terrorists

262
00:11:48,338 --> 00:11:49,731
want with a five-year-old kid

263
00:11:49,756 --> 00:11:52,106
named Luke from Brooklyn?

264
00:11:54,409 --> 00:11:56,977
- Chechen terrorists?
That's who took Luke?

265
00:11:57,735 --> 00:11:58,912
- Yeah.

266
00:11:58,937 --> 00:12:02,874
- That doesn't make any sense.
I mean, he's just a little boy.

267
00:12:02,899 --> 00:12:04,640
Why the hell would they...

268
00:12:04,665 --> 00:12:06,476
- We were hoping
you could tell us.

269
00:12:06,542 --> 00:12:09,210
- I...
- OK.

270
00:12:09,235 --> 00:12:12,717
This is Akhmad Petrov.

271
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:14,892
He's the man from the video.

272
00:12:14,917 --> 00:12:19,502
And these are some of
his known associates.

273
00:12:19,527 --> 00:12:23,046
Here. Can you
look through this?

274
00:12:23,071 --> 00:12:26,468
Take your time and let us know
if you recognize any of them.

275
00:12:41,282 --> 00:12:42,892
- No.

276
00:12:44,232 --> 00:12:46,773
No, this has to be
a mistake, right?

277
00:12:46,798 --> 00:12:48,132
I mean, it doesn't
make any sense.

278
00:12:48,157 --> 00:12:49,332
- No. No, it doesn't.

279
00:12:49,357 --> 00:12:51,794
These men are
professional terrorists.

280
00:12:51,819 --> 00:12:53,168
They wouldn't expose themself

281
00:12:53,193 --> 00:12:55,544
if they didn't think
it was worth the risk.

282
00:12:55,569 --> 00:12:57,135
- So what are you saying?

283
00:12:57,334 --> 00:12:59,946
- I'm saying it just
doesn't exactly feel random.

284
00:13:02,322 --> 00:13:04,542
You've never had any contact
with any of those men?

285
00:13:04,567 --> 00:13:05,829
- No.

286
00:13:05,854 --> 00:13:07,223
- What about your
professional life?

287
00:13:07,247 --> 00:13:08,336
You ever worked
for any companies

288
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,570
based in Eastern Europe?

289
00:13:09,595 --> 00:13:11,745
- Maybe, but nothing
that interesting.

290
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:13,139
I mean, certainly
nothing that would cause

291
00:13:13,163 --> 00:13:15,470
a terror group to kidnap my son.

292
00:13:15,587 --> 00:13:19,286
- Can you elaborate on that,
"nothing that interesting?"

293
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,294
- Am I under investigation here?

294
00:13:23,319 --> 00:13:25,321
- No, OK? Not at all.

295
00:13:25,462 --> 00:13:27,899
- Then what is this?

296
00:13:27,924 --> 00:13:30,795
I don't know who these men
are or why they took my son.

297
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,835
That's why I called you.

298
00:13:33,512 --> 00:13:36,036
You should be out
there looking for him

299
00:13:36,061 --> 00:13:39,648
instead of accusing
me of... What exactly?

300
00:13:39,673 --> 00:13:42,015
- OK, we're just... We're
just trying to understand

301
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:45,671
how they're
connected. That's all.

302
00:13:46,131 --> 00:13:50,527
Um, if you think of
anything, please call us.

303
00:14:01,417 --> 00:14:03,768
What the hell was that?
- Oh, come on.

304
00:14:03,793 --> 00:14:05,738
She recognized the
men in the photos.

305
00:14:05,763 --> 00:14:07,437
You saw that. That's
why she got defensive.

306
00:14:07,461 --> 00:14:09,304
- No, she's in shock, OK?

307
00:14:09,329 --> 00:14:11,804
We just told her that her son
is being held by terrorists.

308
00:14:11,829 --> 00:14:13,949
Can you imagine what that
must feel like for a parent?

309
00:14:13,974 --> 00:14:15,453
- That must be
awful. I get it.

310
00:14:15,478 --> 00:14:18,525
But there's something
off with her.

311
00:14:18,901 --> 00:14:20,788
I can feel it.

312
00:14:21,634 --> 00:14:25,289
What?
- There's nothing off, OK?

313
00:14:25,314 --> 00:14:27,055
She's a mother,
and she's scared.

314
00:14:27,267 --> 00:14:29,095
I'm surprised you can't
really relate to that.

315
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,143
- Of course I can relate to
it, but that's not my job

316
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,647
to relate to a
mother going through

317
00:14:32,672 --> 00:14:35,413
a horrible situation. I'm
trying to find her son.

318
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:38,053
It's Jubal.

319
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:40,867
NYPD helicopter just spotted
Petrov's car heading west

320
00:14:40,892 --> 00:14:42,285
on the Long Island Expressway.

321
00:14:47,465 --> 00:14:48,985
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
There's his car.

322
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:50,533
- I see him.

323
00:14:50,558 --> 00:14:52,256
- We've got eyes on
the suspect's vehicle

324
00:14:52,281 --> 00:14:54,364
on 43rd Avenue turning
south on 9th Street.

325
00:14:54,389 --> 00:14:56,577
- Copy that. We're on our way.

326
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:04,889
- Ah, damn it. We're burned.

327
00:15:04,914 --> 00:15:06,305
- Be advised. The
suspect is fleeing.

328
00:15:06,329 --> 00:15:07,678
We're in pursuit.
- Copy that.

329
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:43,349
- We were right behind him.
He couldn't have gotten far.

330
00:15:53,643 --> 00:15:56,428
Tiff, I think I got something.

331
00:15:56,508 --> 00:15:58,476
- Hey!
- Whoa, oh...

332
00:15:58,501 --> 00:15:59,938
Shots fired.

333
00:15:59,963 --> 00:16:01,090
FBI! Don't move!

334
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:04,927
Let's go.

335
00:16:04,952 --> 00:16:06,388
Suspect is headed
down 9th Street,

336
00:16:06,413 --> 00:16:08,763
stolen motorbike, black jacket.
- Copy that.

337
00:16:50,226 --> 00:16:52,211
- It's not Petrov.

338
00:16:56,367 --> 00:16:58,326
- All right, thank you.

339
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:00,005
Thank you. Hey.

340
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:01,379
Anything?

341
00:17:01,404 --> 00:17:03,119
- I found some brown
hairs in the back seat.

342
00:17:03,143 --> 00:17:04,521
Let's get the lab to run
it against Luke's DNA.

343
00:17:04,545 --> 00:17:06,329
Maybe we'll get a match.

344
00:17:06,415 --> 00:17:08,938
Were we able to
identify our suspect?

345
00:17:08,963 --> 00:17:10,964
- Anzor Taramov,
Chechen national

346
00:17:10,994 --> 00:17:12,766
and suspected member of the CRR.

347
00:17:20,576 --> 00:17:23,067
- I got a bodega receipt.

348
00:17:23,092 --> 00:17:26,080
Two days ago. West 14th
Street and 7th Ave.

349
00:17:28,709 --> 00:17:30,929
- Hey, receipt OA found
was from the purchase

350
00:17:30,954 --> 00:17:32,216
of two burner phones.

351
00:17:32,241 --> 00:17:33,688
Storage just sent
the serial numbers.

352
00:17:33,713 --> 00:17:34,720
- Can we get a location on them?

353
00:17:34,745 --> 00:17:35,884
- Ian's working on it.

354
00:17:35,909 --> 00:17:38,234
- Hairs in the Impala are
a match to Luke Peters,

355
00:17:38,259 --> 00:17:40,017
so our victim was
definitely in that car.

356
00:17:40,042 --> 00:17:42,261
- All right, it means we're
fishing in the right pond.

357
00:17:42,286 --> 00:17:43,369
Talk to me, Ian.

358
00:17:43,394 --> 00:17:44,916
- Location services
have been shut off.

359
00:17:44,941 --> 00:17:45,963
- What about the
carrier services...

360
00:17:45,988 --> 00:17:47,221
Call logs, text messages?

361
00:17:47,246 --> 00:17:48,595
- There's not a lot of activity.

362
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:49,929
The messaging is going
through an encrypted app.

363
00:17:49,954 --> 00:17:51,708
The only calls that they've
made have been to each other.

364
00:17:51,733 --> 00:17:53,866
- So we have no way
of tracking them.

365
00:17:53,891 --> 00:17:55,435
- Well, let's do it
the old-fashioned way.

366
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:57,109
Let's call them and
see where they ping.

367
00:17:57,134 --> 00:17:58,530
- I'm on it.

368
00:18:11,064 --> 00:18:13,727
First phone is shut off.
Trying second number now.

369
00:18:20,071 --> 00:18:21,594
- Hello?

370
00:18:26,228 --> 00:18:28,406
I know you're there. No
need to be concerned.

371
00:18:28,431 --> 00:18:31,289
I'll be there on time, but you
need to deliver proof of life.

372
00:18:31,314 --> 00:18:33,142
I need to know
that my son is OK.

373
00:18:33,167 --> 00:18:37,171
You hear me? Do you hear me?

374
00:18:38,672 --> 00:18:40,740
- That was definitely
the boy's mother.

375
00:18:40,765 --> 00:18:42,322
- She's asking about her son.

376
00:18:42,347 --> 00:18:44,868
- Which means this case
makes even less sense

377
00:18:44,893 --> 00:18:47,199
than it did five minutes ago.

378
00:18:52,728 --> 00:18:54,697
- All right, so we now
have evidence Liza Peters

379
00:18:54,722 --> 00:18:56,921
is in direct contact
with her son's abductors,

380
00:18:56,946 --> 00:18:58,393
which means that
she's been lying to us

381
00:18:58,418 --> 00:19:00,367
from the jump, but
we're gonna talk to her

382
00:19:00,392 --> 00:19:01,318
and see what's going on.

383
00:19:01,343 --> 00:19:02,539
I assume she's still
in her house, right?

384
00:19:02,564 --> 00:19:03,759
- Well, she just
shut off her burner,

385
00:19:03,784 --> 00:19:05,267
but yeah, that call we just
made pinged to her house.

386
00:19:05,292 --> 00:19:06,096
- Yeah.
- OK.

387
00:19:06,121 --> 00:19:07,561
I just spoke to
the agents on site.

388
00:19:07,586 --> 00:19:08,487
She's not there.

389
00:19:08,512 --> 00:19:09,675
- Well, they didn't
just let her leave.

390
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:10,699
- Do we know her location?

391
00:19:10,724 --> 00:19:11,872
- Well, she said she
was gonna take a nap

392
00:19:11,897 --> 00:19:13,159
and climbed out the window,

393
00:19:13,184 --> 00:19:14,841
and they were holding
on to her personal cell

394
00:19:14,866 --> 00:19:16,373
in case a ransom call came in.

395
00:19:16,398 --> 00:19:17,749
They didn't know she
was a flight risk.

396
00:19:17,774 --> 00:19:20,085
- OK, we need to put
out a BOLO right away.

397
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:22,288
In the meantime, let's
get a search warrant.

398
00:19:22,313 --> 00:19:24,021
- ERT already
searched her house.

399
00:19:24,194 --> 00:19:25,474
- Yeah, they did
a forensic sweep

400
00:19:25,499 --> 00:19:26,932
after the abduction,

401
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:29,481
but they weren't
focused on Liza.

402
00:19:32,917 --> 00:19:34,500
- Encryption is tight.

403
00:19:34,525 --> 00:19:36,889
The thing is harder to
get into than Fort Knox.

404
00:19:36,914 --> 00:19:38,329
- Keep trying, OK?

405
00:19:38,354 --> 00:19:40,290
We know that she used
it earlier today.

406
00:19:42,762 --> 00:19:45,069
Any luck?
- No, nothing.

407
00:19:45,094 --> 00:19:47,444
Just a bunch of boring documents

408
00:19:47,469 --> 00:19:50,385
and paperwork like old
pediatrician records

409
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:53,892
and bank statements,
loan statements.

410
00:19:53,917 --> 00:19:56,311
- OK, and yet this boring woman

411
00:19:56,336 --> 00:19:59,993
lied to the FBI and climbs
out of her window to meet up

412
00:20:00,018 --> 00:20:02,716
with the Chechen terrorists.
It just doesn't make any sense.

413
00:20:02,741 --> 00:20:04,821
- Well, of course it does.
She wants to save her son.

414
00:20:05,349 --> 00:20:08,526
- Yeah, I get that,
but why lie to us?

415
00:20:08,551 --> 00:20:13,512
And why sneak out?
- Oh.

416
00:20:15,736 --> 00:20:17,868
Whew, sorry. I'm...

417
00:20:17,893 --> 00:20:21,158
- Hey, hey, are you OK?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

418
00:20:21,183 --> 00:20:25,578
I'm just... I'm so dizzy.

419
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:28,854
Yeah, I just... I just
need some space, OK?

420
00:20:28,879 --> 00:20:30,098
Please just...

421
00:20:30,123 --> 00:20:33,779
OK, OK.

422
00:20:38,891 --> 00:20:40,422
What is that?

423
00:20:41,021 --> 00:20:43,632
- What?
- Do you see that?

424
00:20:50,608 --> 00:20:52,523
It's a safe.

425
00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:14,961
- Oh, sweet. OK, thanks.

426
00:21:14,986 --> 00:21:16,770
- Yeah.
- OK.

427
00:21:17,068 --> 00:21:20,941
- Let's see what we got.
- Yeah.

428
00:21:20,966 --> 00:21:24,057
OK. Cash, credit cards.

429
00:21:24,082 --> 00:21:26,519
What, passports?
- Mm-hmm.

430
00:21:26,544 --> 00:21:28,372
- Six of them?

431
00:21:28,397 --> 00:21:31,008
All belonging to Liza.

432
00:21:31,033 --> 00:21:33,557
- Or Maria or Diana or Larissa.

433
00:21:36,354 --> 00:21:38,225
Who is this woman?

434
00:21:40,764 --> 00:21:42,602
- Liza Peters has six passports,

435
00:21:42,627 --> 00:21:44,977
from four separate countries,
all under different names.

436
00:21:45,002 --> 00:21:47,135
And based on early analysis,
they're not forgeries.

437
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,878
They're genuine,
government-issued documents.

438
00:21:48,902 --> 00:21:51,053
The first question
is, which one is real?

439
00:21:51,078 --> 00:21:52,617
- Well, it seems
like Liza Peters

440
00:21:52,642 --> 00:21:53,782
is her real identity.

441
00:21:53,807 --> 00:21:55,580
We've got a birth
certificate, yearbook photos

442
00:21:55,604 --> 00:21:56,696
dating back 30 years.

443
00:21:56,721 --> 00:21:57,767
- So how did the
others come into play?

444
00:21:57,791 --> 00:21:58,508
Where'd she get them?

445
00:21:58,533 --> 00:22:00,259
- Don't know, but
the Russian passport

446
00:22:00,284 --> 00:22:02,199
under the name Maria
Laskin could explain

447
00:22:02,224 --> 00:22:03,540
her connection to Petrov.

448
00:22:03,565 --> 00:22:05,637
She logged 13 trips from
New York to Chechnya

449
00:22:05,662 --> 00:22:07,032
under that identity.

450
00:22:07,057 --> 00:22:09,112
- And we don't have any idea
of what she was doing there?

451
00:22:09,136 --> 00:22:11,138
- No, customs marked
the trip as personal.

452
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:13,469
- All the other passports show
similar patterns of travel,

453
00:22:13,494 --> 00:22:15,235
all marked personal as well.

454
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:16,848
Over the past 10 years,
she's spent months at a time

455
00:22:16,872 --> 00:22:19,453
in Moscow, Bucharest, Warsaw.

456
00:22:19,478 --> 00:22:21,219
- Yeah, those are all
intelligence hubs.

457
00:22:21,244 --> 00:22:22,854
She's a spy, no doubt.
- Yeah.

458
00:22:22,879 --> 00:22:24,663
Tony, Ann, how we
doing? We need answers.

459
00:22:24,688 --> 00:22:26,523
Does Liza Peters work
for one of your agencies?

460
00:22:26,547 --> 00:22:28,479
- If she's a covert
agent, I don't have access

461
00:22:28,504 --> 00:22:30,258
to that information.
- She's with us.

462
00:22:30,283 --> 00:22:32,349
- Yeah?
- She's CIA.

463
00:22:32,374 --> 00:22:35,213
High-level covert operative,
top secret and SEI clearances.

464
00:22:35,238 --> 00:22:37,701
She's been with the
agency since 2004.

465
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:40,987
- We're gonna need to speak
with your supervisor ASAP.

466
00:22:41,011 --> 00:22:42,622
- I'll set it up.

467
00:22:47,113 --> 00:22:48,638
- How you feeling?

468
00:22:48,663 --> 00:22:49,740
- I'm fine.

469
00:22:49,765 --> 00:22:51,600
- Yeah, but you almost
passed out back at the house.

470
00:22:51,624 --> 00:22:53,341
It looked like you
were in some real pain.

471
00:22:53,366 --> 00:22:56,285
- I'm just feeling off.
- Yeah.

472
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:59,138
No, I noticed. So what's up?

473
00:22:59,163 --> 00:23:01,029
What did the doctor say?

474
00:23:01,054 --> 00:23:02,925
- I don't really want
to talk about it.

475
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:05,029
- Nina, you're making
me nervous here.

476
00:23:05,054 --> 00:23:07,849
Look, if there's
something going on...

477
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:11,213
- I'm pregnant.

478
00:23:13,412 --> 00:23:14,412
- You...

479
00:23:16,727 --> 00:23:18,425
You sure?

480
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:22,541
- Yeah, I'm sure. Uh,
found out last night.

481
00:23:22,566 --> 00:23:24,307
- That's why you
went to the doctor?

482
00:23:24,465 --> 00:23:27,159
- Yeah, I thought I had the flu.

483
00:23:27,184 --> 00:23:29,588
I just didn't
consider that I was...

484
00:23:30,533 --> 00:23:32,187
- Am I...?

485
00:23:32,212 --> 00:23:34,083
- Yeah.

486
00:23:37,877 --> 00:23:41,213
- And do you... Do you
know if you're gonna...

487
00:23:41,401 --> 00:23:45,659
- I don't know. I don't know.

488
00:23:46,627 --> 00:23:48,411
- Can we talk about this?

489
00:23:48,436 --> 00:23:49,785
- Not right now, OK?

490
00:23:54,081 --> 00:23:56,213
Liza's supervisor is here, so...

491
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:04,051
- Liza Peters was
our best case officer

492
00:24:04,076 --> 00:24:05,370
in Eastern Europe.

493
00:24:05,395 --> 00:24:07,745
Was quick on her
feet, tough as nails.

494
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:08,945
We were sorry to lose her

495
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:10,467
in the field when
her son was born.

496
00:24:10,492 --> 00:24:11,928
- She's not active anymore?

497
00:24:11,953 --> 00:24:14,782
- No, she works primarily
in a supervisory role now.

498
00:24:14,807 --> 00:24:16,592
- But she was
working in Chechnya?

499
00:24:16,617 --> 00:24:17,752
- For two years.

500
00:24:17,777 --> 00:24:18,972
She was working
a terrorist group

501
00:24:18,996 --> 00:24:21,924
called the CRR, gathering intel.

502
00:24:21,949 --> 00:24:23,516
Why?

503
00:24:23,541 --> 00:24:25,673
- Well, we think that
members of the CRR,

504
00:24:25,698 --> 00:24:27,134
including Akhmad Petrov,

505
00:24:27,159 --> 00:24:30,031
are responsible for the
abduction of Liza's son.

506
00:24:36,998 --> 00:24:39,696
- What, you think that
Petrov abducted Luke?

507
00:24:39,964 --> 00:24:41,313
- Yeah.

508
00:24:41,338 --> 00:24:44,472
- Do you have any idea
why he would target her?

509
00:24:44,731 --> 00:24:46,033
- No.

510
00:24:46,307 --> 00:24:48,751
As far as I know, Liza
never met Petrov personally.

511
00:24:50,454 --> 00:24:52,630
Unless he's looking
for Milena Kerimova.

512
00:24:52,655 --> 00:24:53,823
- Who's that?

513
00:24:53,848 --> 00:24:56,546
- A Chechen activist,
propagandist.

514
00:24:56,779 --> 00:24:59,757
She's been rallying against
Petrov and the CRR for years.

515
00:24:59,852 --> 00:25:02,328
- And what does she
have to do with Liza?

516
00:25:02,353 --> 00:25:04,790
- Liza recruited her
to work for the CIA,

517
00:25:04,815 --> 00:25:07,874
but about six months
ago, things got hot.

518
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:09,390
Her life was in danger,

519
00:25:09,421 --> 00:25:11,162
so we smuggled her
out of Chechnya

520
00:25:11,187 --> 00:25:12,648
and got her set up
here in New York.

521
00:25:12,673 --> 00:25:14,462
- So if Petrov wants
to kill Kerimova,

522
00:25:14,487 --> 00:25:16,191
Liza is the one that
knows where she is.

523
00:25:16,216 --> 00:25:17,348
Is that what you're saying?

524
00:25:17,373 --> 00:25:18,664
- Liza is in charge
of the safe house

525
00:25:18,688 --> 00:25:21,320
where Kerimova is secured.
- Which is where exactly?

526
00:25:21,345 --> 00:25:22,492
- Long Island.

527
00:25:22,707 --> 00:25:25,884
- OK, I assume you have
agents with Kerimova?

528
00:25:25,909 --> 00:25:27,852
I think you should call them,
tell them what's going on.

529
00:25:27,876 --> 00:25:30,661
- Are you suggesting that
Liza would compromise

530
00:25:30,686 --> 00:25:31,774
her own asset's safety?

531
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:33,867
- To save her son, yeah.

532
00:25:41,474 --> 00:25:43,084
- Can I help you?

533
00:25:43,132 --> 00:25:45,569
- He's one of ours.

534
00:25:45,757 --> 00:25:48,195
- Milena Kerimova,
we need to see her.

535
00:25:48,305 --> 00:25:50,089
- What the hell is going on?

536
00:25:50,176 --> 00:25:51,699
Why are your phones off?

537
00:25:51,849 --> 00:25:54,124
- Liza said there was
a security breach,

538
00:25:54,149 --> 00:25:55,336
told us to shut
down communication

539
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,509
until the transfer was complete.

540
00:25:56,533 --> 00:25:57,765
- What? What transfer?

541
00:25:59,106 --> 00:26:01,543
- Milena Kerimova.
- Are you saying she's gone?

542
00:26:01,568 --> 00:26:04,490
- Liza wanted to move her
to a more secure location.

543
00:26:04,518 --> 00:26:07,349
- When was this?
- About 15 minutes ago.

544
00:26:17,673 --> 00:26:19,255
- Yeah, we got a
bit of a situation.

545
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,385
Liza lied to her fellow
agents, told them

546
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:23,673
there was a security breach
and she had to relocate

547
00:26:23,698 --> 00:26:25,103
the asset she was protecting.

548
00:26:25,128 --> 00:26:26,913
So we need answers.
Where is she?

549
00:26:26,938 --> 00:26:28,580
And more importantly,
where is she going?

550
00:26:28,605 --> 00:26:30,042
Elise, how are we
doing on the video?

551
00:26:30,066 --> 00:26:31,011
- Here we go.

552
00:26:31,036 --> 00:26:34,256
This is from outside the
safe house 24 minutes ago.

553
00:26:34,281 --> 00:26:36,268
- Can we go tighter?
- Here's Liza.

554
00:26:45,942 --> 00:26:47,944
- Doesn't she seem kind of calm

555
00:26:47,969 --> 00:26:49,470
for someone who's about
to hand over her asset

556
00:26:49,494 --> 00:26:50,870
to a terrorist organization?

557
00:26:50,895 --> 00:26:52,808
- Well, we don't know
if that's her plan.

558
00:26:52,833 --> 00:26:55,170
Right now, we need to find
her. What car is she driving?

559
00:26:55,195 --> 00:26:58,329
- 886LSMB. OK, I'm running it.

560
00:27:02,386 --> 00:27:04,736
It's a rental, picked
up from a company

561
00:27:04,761 --> 00:27:07,940
two blocks from Liza's
house at 2:54 p.m.,

562
00:27:07,965 --> 00:27:11,316
paid for with a credit card
belonging to Nancy Lawson.

563
00:27:11,341 --> 00:27:14,390
- Yeah, that's... I think that's
one of the aliases, right?

564
00:27:14,415 --> 00:27:17,667
Yeah, let's get a BOLO
out on that car, thanks.

565
00:27:17,692 --> 00:27:19,128
- What about the car's GPS?

566
00:27:19,153 --> 00:27:20,459
Can the rental company track it?

567
00:27:20,484 --> 00:27:22,839
- Yeah, I'm on with them now.

568
00:27:22,971 --> 00:27:24,801
Yes, they think they can do it.
- Great.

569
00:27:24,826 --> 00:27:26,316
Get their location
over to Scola and Nina.

570
00:27:33,293 --> 00:27:34,733
- There's movement
in the front seat.

571
00:27:34,758 --> 00:27:36,890
Liza Peters, out of the car now!

572
00:27:45,234 --> 00:27:47,279
Where's Kerimova?

573
00:27:47,459 --> 00:27:49,766
In the back seat.

574
00:27:52,557 --> 00:27:53,559
She's fine.

575
00:27:53,584 --> 00:27:55,325
I just gave her a mild sedative.

576
00:28:00,465 --> 00:28:02,641
- You need to tell us
what the hell is going on.

577
00:28:03,023 --> 00:28:05,242
- They gave me a choice,

578
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:08,078
deliver Kerimova
or watch my son die

579
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:10,149
a very painful death.

580
00:28:12,329 --> 00:28:15,233
These people... these animals,
they mean what they say.

581
00:28:15,258 --> 00:28:16,210
- OK, so what?

582
00:28:16,235 --> 00:28:17,410
You were just gonna
deliver Kerimova

583
00:28:17,434 --> 00:28:18,734
and let them execute her?

584
00:28:18,759 --> 00:28:22,347
- What the hell would you do,
watch your son get murdered?

585
00:28:22,372 --> 00:28:26,158
- OK, but what, you couldn't,
so that's why you're here?

586
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:27,318
- OK, all right.

587
00:28:27,343 --> 00:28:28,646
So this is good, OK?

588
00:28:28,671 --> 00:28:31,804
We just... we need a plan.

589
00:28:31,829 --> 00:28:34,015
What is it that Petrov's
asking you to do?

590
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,341
- He wants Kerimova, told
me to meet him by 5:00

591
00:28:36,366 --> 00:28:37,554
or he'll kill Luke.

592
00:28:37,579 --> 00:28:38,719
- OK, where are you
supposed to meet him?

593
00:28:38,743 --> 00:28:40,398
What's... what's
the exact location?

594
00:28:40,423 --> 00:28:43,871
- Some old building by
the beach in Queens,

595
00:28:43,896 --> 00:28:46,028
but the meeting's less than
an hour from now, so...

596
00:28:46,053 --> 00:28:48,046
- No, that's OK. Actually,
that's enough time.

597
00:28:48,071 --> 00:28:49,976
- Well, we can't just
show up, hit the location,

598
00:28:50,001 --> 00:28:52,335
and hope that...
- I have a plan, OK?

599
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:55,558
Look at her, right?
We look enough alike.

600
00:28:55,583 --> 00:28:57,054
I'll just go in her place.

601
00:28:57,079 --> 00:28:59,931
- No, no, that is not a
plan. That is a death wish.

602
00:28:59,956 --> 00:29:01,086
You don't even
speak the language.

603
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:02,156
- Look, all we need to do

604
00:29:02,181 --> 00:29:03,849
is keep the ruse
alive for long enough

605
00:29:03,874 --> 00:29:05,833
to get eyes on Luke, right?

606
00:29:05,912 --> 00:29:07,914
I mean, you know these guys.

607
00:29:07,939 --> 00:29:11,856
Do you think we can do it?
- It could work.

608
00:29:11,881 --> 00:29:13,499
- OK, then I'll run
it up the flagpole.

609
00:29:13,531 --> 00:29:15,163
- OK, hey, hey, hey.

610
00:29:15,188 --> 00:29:16,742
You understand this
is crazy, right?

611
00:29:16,767 --> 00:29:18,887
- It's our only play.
- No, Nina.

612
00:29:18,912 --> 00:29:20,435
I read this guy's file, OK?

613
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:22,741
Petrov decapitated
his own brother.

614
00:29:22,766 --> 00:29:24,937
You cannot go into a
meeting with a person

615
00:29:24,962 --> 00:29:27,315
with less than an hour of prep.
- Well, it's our only move, OK?

616
00:29:27,339 --> 00:29:29,254
So back off.

617
00:29:48,382 --> 00:29:49,818
- OK, we're too far away.

618
00:29:49,843 --> 00:29:51,082
I mean, if anything
goes sideways,

619
00:29:51,106 --> 00:29:52,281
we can't even get to them.

620
00:29:52,306 --> 00:29:54,265
- We get any closer,
they'll see us.

621
00:29:58,803 --> 00:30:01,030
- OK, we have a black,
blue Dodge Durango,

622
00:30:01,055 --> 00:30:04,667
license plate number 437HDVX.

623
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,513
- We're running it.

624
00:30:08,538 --> 00:30:10,338
- It's cold plated. Looks
like an older model.

625
00:30:10,363 --> 00:30:11,407
We can't track that.

626
00:30:11,432 --> 00:30:12,461
- Can we get eyes on the inside?

627
00:30:12,485 --> 00:30:14,020
How many guys we
dealing with here?

628
00:30:14,045 --> 00:30:15,250
- I've got eyes
inside of the vehicle,

629
00:30:15,274 --> 00:30:17,704
but I only see one guy, and
it doesn't look like Petrov.

630
00:30:17,729 --> 00:30:19,122
- What about the little boy?

631
00:30:19,208 --> 00:30:20,905
- No, I don't see him.

632
00:30:39,049 --> 00:30:41,399
- It's not Petrov.

633
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:48,999
- Out of the car.

634
00:31:26,871 --> 00:31:28,525
Get in.

635
00:31:40,226 --> 00:31:41,538
Start the car.

636
00:31:44,311 --> 00:31:45,748
- Where is my son?

637
00:31:45,773 --> 00:31:47,775
- I'll take you to him.
Just do what I say.

638
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,888
- No, no, they changed
the plan, let's call it.

639
00:31:49,913 --> 00:31:51,156
- If we arrest this guy now,

640
00:31:51,181 --> 00:31:52,500
Petrov's gonna know that
something went wrong,

641
00:31:52,524 --> 00:31:54,010
and he's gonna kill the
kid and cut his losses.

642
00:31:54,034 --> 00:31:55,383
Our best bet is to follow them.

643
00:31:55,408 --> 00:31:56,437
- If they even come back.

644
00:31:56,462 --> 00:31:57,766
For all we know, he
could have them pull over

645
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:59,538
at the side of the road
and shoot them both.

646
00:31:59,563 --> 00:32:00,788
Isobel.

647
00:32:00,813 --> 00:32:02,663
- You know this guy
better than we do.

648
00:32:02,688 --> 00:32:04,603
Are we walking into a trap here?

649
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,156
- I don't think so.

650
00:32:06,181 --> 00:32:07,948
Petrov will want to deal
with Kerimova himself,

651
00:32:07,972 --> 00:32:09,288
so I think they're safe...

652
00:32:09,313 --> 00:32:11,073
Until they actually meet
up with him, anyway.

653
00:32:11,098 --> 00:32:12,796
Then, it's a toss-up.

654
00:32:15,462 --> 00:32:18,074
- All right, we're gonna let
Liza and Nina make the call.

655
00:32:18,122 --> 00:32:19,645
It's their lives on the line.

656
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:21,280
- We're talking about
handing Nina over

657
00:32:21,305 --> 00:32:22,611
to an executioner here.

658
00:32:22,636 --> 00:32:24,464
- If Nina wanted out,

659
00:32:24,489 --> 00:32:26,361
she would have
given us a signal.

660
00:32:29,425 --> 00:32:31,335
She's got this.

661
00:32:32,778 --> 00:32:34,650
- I'm not going anywhere.

662
00:32:34,675 --> 00:32:36,374
I need to know my son's alive.

663
00:32:47,302 --> 00:32:48,826
<i>Put the kid on.</i>

664
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:52,662
Luke.

665
00:32:52,687 --> 00:32:55,175
- Mommy, I want to go home.

666
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,400
- I know, honey,
I know. It's oK.

667
00:32:57,425 --> 00:32:59,288
I'm coming. I'm on my way.

668
00:32:59,689 --> 00:33:01,342
- Drive.

669
00:33:27,059 --> 00:33:29,409
- Do we know where
they're headed yet?

670
00:33:29,698 --> 00:33:31,526
- Somewhere in Long Island.

671
00:33:32,943 --> 00:33:34,728
- We have a problem.

672
00:33:34,753 --> 00:33:36,297
- The licensed car just
turn down a private road.

673
00:33:36,321 --> 00:33:38,236
If we follow it now, our
cover's gonna be blown.

674
00:33:38,261 --> 00:33:39,438
- No, no, no. We
don't know that.

675
00:33:39,462 --> 00:33:41,071
- If we pull them over right
now, we can spook them.

676
00:33:41,095 --> 00:33:42,663
It could get Nina
and Liza killed.

677
00:33:58,694 --> 00:34:00,114
- Take it easy.

678
00:34:04,189 --> 00:34:05,465
- Don't move.

679
00:34:20,314 --> 00:34:21,880
<i>Do you who we are?</i>

680
00:34:21,905 --> 00:34:24,421
<i>She won't answer
you. She's stubborn.</i>

681
00:34:25,116 --> 00:34:28,353
<i>Hasn't said a word
since I picked her up...</i>

682
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:31,806
<i>Then how do I know she
is who you say she is?</i>

683
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:33,830
<i>I want to hear voice.</i>

684
00:34:34,455 --> 00:34:35,860
<i>Speak.</i>

685
00:34:36,993 --> 00:34:38,462
<i>Speak.</i>

686
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:12,696
- You OK?
- Yeah, I'm good.

687
00:35:12,721 --> 00:35:14,172
- Tiff, how far out are y'all?

688
00:35:14,197 --> 00:35:15,298
- We're about six minutes away.

689
00:35:15,322 --> 00:35:17,102
We have your location.
- OK.

690
00:35:17,127 --> 00:35:18,290
Here.

691
00:35:19,571 --> 00:35:21,045
- OK, wait for
backup to make entry.

692
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:23,116
We will be there
in five minutes.

693
00:35:23,141 --> 00:35:24,229
- OK.

694
00:35:24,254 --> 00:35:26,169
Liza, hey. Where
are you going?

695
00:35:26,194 --> 00:35:27,391
- I'm not waiting.

696
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:28,641
- Come on. They're close.

697
00:35:28,666 --> 00:35:29,861
We don't know how many
guys are in there, Liza.

698
00:35:29,885 --> 00:35:31,278
- My son is in there.

699
00:35:31,572 --> 00:35:33,052
You do what you
want. I'm going in.

700
00:35:33,137 --> 00:35:34,443
- Liza... Liza!

701
00:35:34,468 --> 00:35:36,234
- No, Nina, wait for backup.

702
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:38,568
Nina!

703
00:35:53,462 --> 00:35:55,072
- Ah!

704
00:36:03,363 --> 00:36:04,827
- Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey. He's down.

705
00:36:04,852 --> 00:36:06,649
Are you OK?
- I don't think I can stand on it.

706
00:36:06,673 --> 00:36:08,037
- OK. Put pressure on it, OK?

707
00:36:08,062 --> 00:36:09,187
I'm gonna stay with you.

708
00:36:09,212 --> 00:36:11,301
- Mom!
- Luke?

709
00:36:11,337 --> 00:36:12,730
Stay where you are.

710
00:36:12,755 --> 00:36:14,536
Please, you have to go find him.

711
00:36:14,561 --> 00:36:15,992
- OK.

712
00:36:16,283 --> 00:36:17,458
Stay covered.

713
00:36:17,537 --> 00:36:19,191
I'll be back.

714
00:36:19,285 --> 00:36:20,945
Luke?

715
00:36:43,528 --> 00:36:46,096
Hey, hi.

716
00:36:47,236 --> 00:36:48,772
Hi. My name is Nina, OK?

717
00:36:48,797 --> 00:36:51,062
I'm gonna take you...
- Step away from the child.

718
00:36:51,087 --> 00:36:52,999
- Stay here.

719
00:36:53,434 --> 00:36:55,240
- Step away from the child.

720
00:36:55,265 --> 00:36:57,824
- OK, OK!

721
00:37:08,994 --> 00:37:10,213
Come here. Come on.

722
00:37:10,238 --> 00:37:11,687
I'm gonna take you
to your mom, OK?

723
00:37:11,712 --> 00:37:13,497
Come here, buddy.

724
00:37:28,141 --> 00:37:29,257
- OK.

725
00:37:29,282 --> 00:37:32,790
Give Mommy one last big
hug, then we have to go.

726
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,257
- Bye-bye, sweet boy.

727
00:37:39,809 --> 00:37:41,577
Be good for Daddy.

728
00:37:58,991 --> 00:38:01,573
- Hey.
- Hey.

729
00:38:02,291 --> 00:38:04,497
I don't know how to thank you
for what you did in there.

730
00:38:04,522 --> 00:38:06,401
I know I put you at risk.

731
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:08,729
- It's all right.

732
00:38:09,162 --> 00:38:10,729
They're gonna take
you to the hospital,

733
00:38:10,754 --> 00:38:12,408
get your leg all fixed up, OK?

734
00:38:13,929 --> 00:38:15,565
- And then what?

735
00:38:16,341 --> 00:38:18,859
- They are gonna charge you
with the abduction of Kerimova

736
00:38:18,884 --> 00:38:20,525
and violation of
the Espionage Act,

737
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:22,161
but we're gonna talk
to the U.S. Attorney

738
00:38:22,193 --> 00:38:24,064
let him know the
situation you were in.

739
00:38:24,089 --> 00:38:25,742
- I appreciate that. I do.

740
00:38:25,767 --> 00:38:27,288
But I'm good.

741
00:38:35,214 --> 00:38:36,911
I did what I had to do.

742
00:38:36,936 --> 00:38:39,199
They were gonna kill my son.

743
00:38:39,224 --> 00:38:42,358
And at the end of
the day, he's safe.

744
00:38:42,491 --> 00:38:44,232
That's enough.

745
00:39:01,057 --> 00:39:02,797
- Hey, what's that about?

746
00:39:02,822 --> 00:39:04,695
- I don't know.

747
00:39:13,338 --> 00:39:14,949
- Are you good?

748
00:39:15,255 --> 00:39:17,351
- Yeah, I'm good.

749
00:39:17,857 --> 00:39:20,968
This is gonna be my last case
with you guys for a while.

750
00:39:21,419 --> 00:39:22,769
- What are you talking about?

751
00:39:23,184 --> 00:39:24,898
We were just getting started.

752
00:39:25,374 --> 00:39:26,534
- Yeah, I know.

753
00:39:26,559 --> 00:39:31,702
I just... I need to take
some time and clear my head.

754
00:39:34,658 --> 00:39:37,444
But I'm just gonna go down
to white collar, you know?

755
00:39:37,469 --> 00:39:39,558
I'm gonna take on all
the dangerous dudes

756
00:39:39,583 --> 00:39:43,108
on Wall Street there who are
doing insider trading, so...

757
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:45,218
OK.

758
00:39:45,243 --> 00:39:47,023
I'll be honest, though.

759
00:39:47,048 --> 00:39:48,715
I don't think I'm
completely OK with this,

760
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:50,124
but if it's for the best...

761
00:39:50,149 --> 00:39:51,846
- I'll be two floors down.

762
00:39:51,871 --> 00:39:53,743
Don't get emotional.

763
00:39:55,077 --> 00:39:57,046
- Bye-bye.

764
00:39:58,913 --> 00:40:00,523
- Can I walk you out?

765
00:40:00,548 --> 00:40:01,810
- Of course.

766
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:09,787
- So will you talk to me, Nina?

767
00:40:09,812 --> 00:40:11,553
What's going on? why?

768
00:40:11,578 --> 00:40:12,907
Why are you really leaving?

769
00:40:16,064 --> 00:40:19,065
- I just need some time,
like I said, you know,

770
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:21,919
to figure things out,

771
00:40:21,944 --> 00:40:25,751
what I'm gonna do
with my life and you.

772
00:40:29,342 --> 00:40:33,476
- So what about the baby?

773
00:40:36,205 --> 00:40:37,782
- I don't know.

774
00:40:37,807 --> 00:40:40,070
Like I said, I just
need some time.

775
00:41:02,109 --> 00:41:04,242
I'll call you, OK?

776
00:41:06,386 --> 00:41:08,242
- Yeah.

777
00:41:17,013 --> 00:41:18,638
Bye.
