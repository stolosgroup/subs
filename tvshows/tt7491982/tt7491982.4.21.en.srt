retired DEA agent

He was gunned down

Looks like a hit.

Anyone following him?
Did he get into an
altercation?

65
00:02:33,283 --> 00:02:35,067
No, nothing like that.

66
00:02:35,111 --> 00:02:37,505
What was he doing that he
was here every morning at 6:00
a.m.?

67
00:02:37,548 --> 00:02:40,203
at Show Palace on Lorimer.
- He was bouncing over

68
00:02:40,247 --> 00:02:42,118
under the table.
I think it was

69

Um, I don't want to get him
in any trouble.

00:02:44,076 --> 00:02:45,643
Thanks for talking to us.
- No worries.

Tommy was a good guy.

74

Tommy was a really solid dude.
- He's right,

75
00:02:56,001 --> 00:02:57,089
I worked with him
for like three years

76
00:02:57,133 --> 00:02:59,744
in joint task force.

77
00:02:59,788 --> 00:03:01,485
Well, let's do right by him

78
00:03:01,529 --> 00:03:03,183
and catch the guy
that did this then.

79
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,494
I hired Tommy
the second I met him.

80
00:03:10,538 --> 00:03:12,627
Worked for the DEA, means you
know how to handle yourself,

81
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:13,932
right?
- Could he?

82

Always defused stuff
before it got outta hand.

00:03:20,156 --> 00:03:21,897
So he never got
into it with clientele?

86
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,681
With clientele, no.

87
00:03:23,725 --> 00:03:26,293
But he did have words with
some mope a couple of nights back.

88
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:29,470
Okay, can you
tell us about it?

came storming in here.

How heated did that get?

96
00:03:44,485 --> 00:03:46,182
Raised voices
was the extent of it,

97
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:49,272
and then Tommy
showed him the door.

of hay, we're not going to find

161
00:06:46,667 --> 00:06:48,538
that needle and this
trail is going to go cold.

162
00:06:48,582 --> 00:06:50,671
Oh, it looks like that's not
going to happen anytime soon.

163
00:06:50,714 --> 00:06:52,107
Yeah, what do you got?

164
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:53,848
NYPD just reached out
about another murder

165
00:06:53,891 --> 00:06:54,892
in Inwood.

166
00:06:54,936 --> 00:06:56,546
Tall, masked gunman on foot

167
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:58,461
took out a janitor
at St. Mary's church.

168
00:06:58,505 --> 00:07:00,507
Two in the chest, looks like
they may be connected.

169
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:02,596
Yeah,
only one way to find out.

170
00:07:08,993 --> 00:07:10,517
Detective, what do we have?

171
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,606
Victim is Willy Lomax.

172
00:07:12,649 --> 00:07:14,912
Been tidying up
St. Mary's for 36 years.

173
00:07:14,956 --> 00:07:16,610
Any luck with video?

174
00:07:16,653 --> 00:07:18,829
No security camera,
as far as we can tell.

175
00:07:18,873 --> 00:07:20,396
We just spoke to the witness.

176
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,486
Antoinette Pissaro called it
A parishioner named in,

177
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:25,575
saying she came here
to plant flowers,

178
00:07:25,619 --> 00:07:27,490
saw a masked guy run up,

179
00:07:27,534 --> 00:07:30,101
plug Mr. Lomax.

180
00:07:39,937 --> 00:07:41,896
Same M.O. as Tommy Webber.

181
00:07:41,939 --> 00:07:43,593
Now we just have to prove it.

182
00:07:43,637 --> 00:07:46,030

I think we just have.

183

184
00:07:51,732 --> 00:07:53,690
.45 Winchester.

<i>♪</i>

186
00:08:06,573 --> 00:08:07,835
All right, team,
so preliminary ballistics

187
00:08:07,878 --> 00:08:09,010
confirms that
the shell from the church

188
00:08:09,053 --> 00:08:10,533
is a match
to the one from the bakery,

189
00:08:10,577 --> 00:08:12,187
so we need
to figure out the connection.

190
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:14,624
Why did our shooter
target both these victims?

191
00:08:14,668 --> 00:08:16,191
Well,
they live 15 miles apart

192
00:08:16,234 --> 00:08:17,888
and have no social
or professional nexus.

193
00:08:17,932 --> 00:08:19,194
Is there any
reason to believe that

194
00:08:19,237 --> 00:08:21,370
Lomax ran into
Webber at Show Palace?

195
00:08:21,413 --> 00:08:23,415
No, there's no
evidence that Lomax stepped

196
00:08:23,459 --> 00:08:27,071
foot outside
of Inwood this year.

197
00:08:27,115 --> 00:08:28,682
So maybe this has
more to do with his DEA past

198
00:08:28,725 --> 00:08:30,074
than his
strip club present.

199
00:08:30,118 --> 00:08:33,121
But Lomax has never
been on the DEA's radar.

200
00:08:33,164 --> 00:08:35,123
Actually, that's not true.

201
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:37,038
What?

202
00:08:37,081 --> 00:08:40,302
Before he retired, Webber
led a big RICO investigation

203
00:08:40,345 --> 00:08:42,609
into a drug syndicate
called LS-19.

204
00:08:42,652 --> 00:08:44,262
Yeah, I ran across them
when I worked drugs.

205
00:08:44,306 --> 00:08:45,568
They're a big player
in the heroin market.

206
00:08:45,612 --> 00:08:47,222
Right, right.

207
00:08:47,265 --> 00:08:49,093
And the investigation
culminated in a RICO indictment

208
00:08:49,137 --> 00:08:51,748
of two dozen
LS-19 associates.

209
00:08:51,792 --> 00:08:53,968
Now the trial is
finally calendared

210
00:08:54,011 --> 00:08:55,752
for next month
in the Eastern District.

211
00:08:55,796 --> 00:08:57,537
They're
in the jury selection now.

212
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,974
So a lead investigator like
Webber would have to testify,

213
00:09:00,017 --> 00:09:01,845
which would put
a target on his back.

214
00:09:01,889 --> 00:09:03,978
But what does that have
to do with the church janitor?

215
00:09:04,021 --> 00:09:05,849
- Was he a witness too?
- Bingo.

216
00:09:05,893 --> 00:09:08,460
Lomax was moonlighting as
a mechanic and apparently found

217
00:09:08,504 --> 00:09:11,899
drugs stashed in the wheel
well of an LS soldier's ride.

218
00:09:11,942 --> 00:09:13,640
Prosecution was
going to call him.

219
00:09:13,683 --> 00:09:16,512
Service needs to coordinate
- Yeah, Teddy, Marshal's
with DEA

220
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,688
and get every witness in that
trial into protective custody.

221
00:09:18,732 --> 00:09:20,995
- I'll see to it.
- Nina, Tiffany,

222
00:09:21,038 --> 00:09:22,605
we need to take
a deep dive into LS-19.

223
00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:24,781
Yeah, we'll talk to the DEA,
see what they know.

224
00:09:25,042 --> 00:09:25,739
Great.

225
00:09:28,306 --> 00:09:30,308
Thank you for meeting with
us, Jennifer.

226
00:09:30,352 --> 00:09:32,876
I was sorry to hear
about Tommy.

227
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,444
One of the best agents
I ever supervised.

228
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:38,578
And I know you two
were friends.

229
00:09:38,621 --> 00:09:41,450
I learned a lot from him.
He was a great agent.

230
00:09:41,493 --> 00:09:43,234
So how can I help?

231
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:44,975
Well, we're thinking that
Agent Webber's murder

232
00:09:45,019 --> 00:09:47,761
had something to do with his
up upcoming trial against LS
- 19.

233
00:09:47,804 --> 00:09:50,372
Tommy worked that case
for three years.

234
00:09:50,415 --> 00:09:53,680
Hitting LS-19 like that was
the takedown of a lifetime.

235
00:09:53,723 --> 00:09:55,420
So what can you tell us
about it?

236
00:09:55,464 --> 00:09:57,422
Ruthless, tight-knit--

237
00:09:57,466 --> 00:10:00,121
presence in five cities,
but it's run like a syndicate.

238
00:10:00,164 --> 00:10:02,297
That RICO case had
two dozen named defendants.

239
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,342
Do you have any thoughts on
who might've pulled the
trigger?

240
00:10:04,386 --> 00:10:06,301
No, but I can tell you

241
00:10:06,344 --> 00:10:08,042
none of them
would've had the authority

242
00:10:08,085 --> 00:10:12,176
to greenlight the murder
of a DEA agent.

243
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:14,396
But here's who would have.

244
00:10:18,574 --> 00:10:21,359
Callum Brewster--
runs the Brooklyn branch

245
00:10:21,403 --> 00:10:24,406
of the gang that Webber's
indictment could bring down.

246
00:10:24,449 --> 00:10:27,278
Has a restaurant in Clinton
Hill called the Square Note.

247
00:10:27,322 --> 00:10:29,063
Is it a front?

248
00:10:29,106 --> 00:10:30,978
We've been trying to nail
him with money laundering charges

249
00:10:31,021 --> 00:10:34,851
for the past year, but place
appears to be fairly legit.

250

- He in the system?
- Not even a parking ticket.

251
00:10:37,332 --> 00:10:40,204
Guy's careful.
But here's what's interesting.

252
00:10:40,248 --> 00:10:42,032
We're pretty sure
he worked his way up

253
00:10:42,076 --> 00:10:44,034
to the top
of the Brooklyn branch

254

on the strength of his skill
as a hit man.

255
00:10:48,256 --> 00:10:49,779

He keeps everything

260
00:10:59,136 --> 00:11:00,616
a visit from us is going
to scare him too much.

00:21:29,636 --> 00:21:31,333
Guys,
what the hell is going on?

477
00:21:31,377 --> 00:21:33,030
What am I missing?
- I don't know.

478
00:21:33,074 --> 00:21:34,597
The only thing that makes
sense to me is that Brewster

479
00:21:34,641 --> 00:21:36,512
was working with somebody
else, maybe somebody higher up

480
00:21:36,556 --> 00:21:38,862
in the gang,
somebody giving orders.

481
00:21:38,906 --> 00:21:41,474
And whoever this was didn't
want to leave any loose ends,

482
00:21:41,517 --> 00:21:44,564
so he dumped Brewster
to tie off the investigation.

483
00:21:44,607 --> 00:21:46,348
But according
to the gang unit,

484
00:21:46,392 --> 00:21:48,481
Brewster is the boss
of the LS-19s.

485
00:21:48,524 --> 00:21:49,960
Yeah.
That's what they said.

486
00:21:50,004 --> 00:21:52,572
But as we know,
everybody answers to someone.

487
00:21:52,615 --> 00:21:54,400
Boss or no boss.

488
00:21:54,443 --> 00:21:56,097
Hey, we cloned
Brewster's phone, right?

489
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,185
- Mm-hmm.
- When was the last call

490
00:21:57,228 --> 00:21:58,795
he made or received?

491
00:21:58,839 --> 00:22:00,536
It was an incoming one
from another burner

492
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:03,713
while he was still at the bar, and...

493
00:22:03,757 --> 00:22:06,542
yeah, that same burner
called him just before

494
00:22:06,586 --> 00:22:08,239
and just after the Webber
and Lomax killings.

495
00:22:08,283 --> 00:22:09,980
So let's cross-reference
this unknown number

496
00:22:10,024 --> 00:22:11,460
with the other
agency databases.

497
00:22:11,504 --> 00:22:13,636
See if we can ID
this unknown caller.

498
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,421
Whoa.

499
00:22:15,464 --> 00:22:16,596
This number is
linked to a pending

500
00:22:16,639 --> 00:22:18,206
Homeland Security investigation.

501
00:22:18,249 --> 00:22:19,468
Homeland Security,
see if you can tell

502
00:22:19,512 --> 00:22:20,904
who that number
tracks back to.

503
00:22:20,948 --> 00:22:22,210
No need.

504
00:22:22,253 --> 00:22:23,298
What do you mean?

505
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:24,952
The waitress, Kayla.

506
00:22:24,995 --> 00:22:26,954
There are tons of calls
to and from her phone

507
00:22:26,997 --> 00:22:28,999
to that same burner.

508
00:22:29,043 --> 00:22:30,392
How do you remember that?

509
00:22:30,436 --> 00:22:33,700
Well, I could also give you
pi to 300 digits.

510
00:22:33,743 --> 00:22:36,529
O-okay, let's stick
to the phone number thing.

511
00:22:36,572 --> 00:22:38,095
Bring Kayla in.

512
00:22:44,493 --> 00:22:46,408
You said I had one job
then I was done.

513
00:22:46,452 --> 00:22:48,105
This is part of that job.

514
00:22:48,149 --> 00:22:49,629
We need some
more information, okay?

515
00:22:49,672 --> 00:22:52,545
No, not okay.

516
00:22:52,588 --> 00:22:56,026
Kayla,
Callum Brewster's dead.

517
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:57,767
What?

518
00:22:57,811 --> 00:22:58,942
Now we need to figure out
who killed him,

519
00:22:58,986 --> 00:23:00,422
otherwise a lot more people
could die

520
00:23:00,466 --> 00:23:04,034
and you don't want that
to happen, correct?

521
00:23:04,078 --> 00:23:06,428
Did this have anything to do
with me stealing his phone?

522
00:23:06,472 --> 00:23:08,909
No, it has nothing to do
with that, I promise you.

523
00:23:08,952 --> 00:23:10,650
But it does have to do
with who Callum was

524
00:23:10,693 --> 00:23:14,871
and why we still
need your help.

525
00:23:14,915 --> 00:23:18,309
What do you want to know?

526
00:23:18,353 --> 00:23:21,269
Whose number is this?

527
00:23:21,312 --> 00:23:23,227
My boyfriend Trey's.

528
00:23:23,271 --> 00:23:26,056
African American guy,
drives the Range Rover, right?

529
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:28,407
Yeah, we live together.

530
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:29,930
What's his last name?

531
00:23:29,973 --> 00:23:32,541
Cooper.

532
00:23:32,585 --> 00:23:35,588
Why?

533
00:23:35,631 --> 00:23:37,416
He's got nothing to do
with Brewster.

534
00:23:37,459 --> 00:23:39,592
Trey's clean.
He barely drinks.

535
00:23:39,635 --> 00:23:43,726
He has a business.
He sells towels, bathrobes.

536
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:45,554
Can I go now?
- We need you to stay put

537
00:23:45,598 --> 00:23:47,295
in case
we have more questions.

538
00:23:47,338 --> 00:23:48,644
You said all
I had to do was grab

539
00:23:48,688 --> 00:23:51,081
Brewster's phone
and then I'd be done.

540
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:53,127
I did that, so I'm done.

541
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:56,304
Kayla, sit down!

542
00:23:56,347 --> 00:23:59,438
Unless you want
to go back to jail.

543
00:23:59,481 --> 00:24:01,265
You're done when
we say you're done.

<i>♪</i>

545
00:24:15,497 --> 00:24:16,672
All right, team,
we need to dig deeper

546
00:24:16,716 --> 00:24:18,369
into Kayla's boyfriend,
Trey Cooper.

547
00:24:18,413 --> 00:24:21,068
Yep, we ran him before,
but he's not in the system.

548
00:24:21,111 --> 00:24:23,157
Well, it means he's smart,
not innocent.

549
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,072
Right, let's put him
under the microscope.

550
00:24:25,115 --> 00:24:26,769
Elise, talk to me
about his business.

551
00:24:26,813 --> 00:24:29,990
His textile company reported
about $20 million in revenue

552
00:24:30,033 --> 00:24:32,862
last year, but here's
the ownership structure.

553
00:24:32,906 --> 00:24:35,299
We're looking at
S corporations, LLCs,

554
00:24:35,343 --> 00:24:37,388
LPs with offshore
partners in Panama.

555
00:24:37,432 --> 00:24:39,086
The kind of corporate
structure you'd expect

556
00:24:39,129 --> 00:24:41,305
if you were laundering
money for the LS-19.

557
00:24:41,349 --> 00:24:44,134
Right, so how do we tie him
to these three murders?

558
00:24:44,178 --> 00:24:45,092
Well, finding
the murder weapon

559
00:24:45,135 --> 00:24:46,876
would be a hell of a start.

560
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,530
Or we could
try for a warrant.

561
00:24:48,574 --> 00:24:51,185
No, we don't have enough.

562
00:24:51,228 --> 00:24:55,450
We could also put
Kayla back in play.

563
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:56,669
I mean, she lives with him,

564
00:24:56,712 --> 00:24:58,235
has access
to his personal property.

565
00:24:58,279 --> 00:24:59,846
We did make a deal
with her, though.

566
00:24:59,889 --> 00:25:01,717
Brewster's phone, she was
You know, she grabbed even.

567
00:25:01,761 --> 00:25:03,284
I'd rather renege on a deal

568
00:25:03,327 --> 00:25:05,112
and catch a guy
that killed three people

569
00:25:05,155 --> 00:25:06,853
than honor it
and let his ass walk.

570
00:25:06,896 --> 00:25:08,376
Well, we have
a duty to protect her.

571
00:25:08,419 --> 00:25:09,812
We also have
a duty to Tommy Webber.

572
00:25:09,856 --> 00:25:11,553
We're asking a girl
that we caught

573
00:25:11,597 --> 00:25:14,121
with a couple of pills
to run multiple operations.

574
00:25:14,164 --> 00:25:16,427
It just--it feels
really risky.

575
00:25:16,471 --> 00:25:20,170
I hear you, but right now,
Kayla is the best game in town.

576
00:25:20,214 --> 00:25:23,434
She's got access to Trey's
house and his property.

577
00:25:23,478 --> 00:25:26,742
So talk to Kayla, see if you
can persuade her to play ball.

578
00:25:31,921 --> 00:25:34,576
Trey?

579
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:35,925
A killer?

580
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:42,497
You're joking, right?

581
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:44,804
No, not even close.

582
00:25:44,847 --> 00:25:46,545
The guy you're living with
has another life,

583
00:25:46,588 --> 00:25:47,937
and it's a dangerous one.

584
00:25:47,981 --> 00:25:49,069
Do you want to be
a part of that?

585
00:25:49,112 --> 00:25:50,810
I'm not a part of it.

586
00:25:50,853 --> 00:25:53,552
I wait tables.
I go to nursing school.

587
00:25:53,595 --> 00:25:55,684
Does Trey own a gun?

588
00:25:55,728 --> 00:25:58,557
I mean, for protection.

589
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,428
He's worried someone
might try to rob us.

590
00:26:00,471 --> 00:26:02,473
Does he own a gun
like this one?

591
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:09,785
I don't know, all guns
kind of look the same, right?

592
00:26:09,829 --> 00:26:13,180
But does he own one
that kind of looks like that?

593
00:26:15,791 --> 00:26:17,880
Yeah.

594
00:26:17,924 --> 00:26:20,230
We're going to need you
to get that gun for us.

595
00:26:20,274 --> 00:26:22,624
- No. No way.
- Look, if we're wrong,

596
00:26:22,668 --> 00:26:24,887
then your boyfriend's gun
won't be a match for the murders

597
00:26:24,931 --> 00:26:26,454
and you'll know
that he's a businessman.

598
00:26:26,497 --> 00:26:29,849
But if we're right
and he's a dangerous criminal,

599
00:26:29,892 --> 00:26:34,549
I would think
you would want to know.

600
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:36,377
Where does he keep his guns?

601
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:38,031
In his safe in the closet.

602
00:26:38,074 --> 00:26:39,772
Okay, do you know
the combination?

603
00:26:39,815 --> 00:26:42,296
It's not that kind of safe.
There's a key under the mat.

604
00:26:42,339 --> 00:26:44,994
Good.
It'll be easy to open then.

605
00:26:45,038 --> 00:26:48,215
You promised me.

606
00:26:48,258 --> 00:26:50,783
You promised me
I was finished.

607
00:26:50,826 --> 00:26:53,437
I was done.

608
00:26:53,481 --> 00:26:58,660
Do you want to go to jail
for the opioids we busted you
with?

609
00:26:58,704 --> 00:27:02,011
Your future, nursing school--
everything would be over.

Okay,
this stone in the necklace,

it hides
a tiny little camera.

everything that you see.

And I don't
have to operate it?

Nope, it's just there.

794
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:25,243
a job, a career,

795
00:37:25,286 --> 00:37:27,506
and today I have nothing.

796
00:37:30,944 --> 00:37:34,034
I did trust you.

797
00:37:34,077 --> 00:37:35,949
I believed you.

Hey.

800
00:38:00,365 --> 00:38:02,802
I just, um, wanted to say
about Kayla--

801
00:38:02,845 --> 00:38:07,937
Yeah, I don't really
wanna talk about her.

802
00:38:07,981 --> 00:38:09,330
Well, I just want you to
know that I'm not thrilled

803
00:38:09,374 --> 00:38:12,725
about how this all
turned out either.

804
00:38:12,768 --> 00:38:14,466
But I don't think
she's the victim.

805
00:38:14,509 --> 00:38:15,945
The families are the people
who are murdered are.

806
00:38:15,989 --> 00:38:18,165
Yeah, I know that
she's not the victim.

807
00:38:18,208 --> 00:38:20,210
You know what?
Whatever.

808
00:38:20,254 --> 00:38:24,476
Maybe this bleeding heart
thing just comes with the territory.

809
00:38:24,519 --> 00:38:26,304
And what territory
might that be?

810
00:38:26,347 --> 00:38:28,697
I don't know.

811
00:38:28,741 --> 00:38:31,004
The territory where
privileged people

812
00:38:31,047 --> 00:38:32,875
with Rolexes live.

813
00:38:32,919 --> 00:38:35,356
Okay.

814
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,967
I bought myself this
when I graduated Quantico

815
00:38:38,011 --> 00:38:40,666
as a gift.

816
00:38:40,709 --> 00:38:42,537
And the privileged territory
that I grew up in

817
00:38:42,581 --> 00:38:45,279
was a trailer park
in East Houston.

818
00:38:49,109 --> 00:38:53,200
I just overheard you
talking about your trust fund.

819
00:38:53,243 --> 00:38:55,637
Not my trust fund.

820
00:38:59,075 --> 00:39:02,252
I had a CI

821
00:39:02,296 --> 00:39:04,211
who got killed last year--

822
00:39:04,254 --> 00:39:05,517
had a daughter who was 19,

823
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:09,390
and I sent her
$500 every month.

824
00:39:09,434 --> 00:39:11,044
She pays for college that way,

825
00:39:11,087 --> 00:39:14,439
but I send it to a trust
so that she doesn't blow it.

826
00:39:16,789 --> 00:39:18,138
I see.

I'm sorry.

829
00:39:28,017 --> 00:39:31,543
I made an assumption
and that was wrong of me.

830
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:36,199
It's okay.

831
00:39:36,243 --> 00:39:38,463
Was a tough case.

832
00:39:41,422 --> 00:39:44,207
You know, um...

833
00:39:44,251 --> 00:39:47,341
you know, when I first...

834
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:50,562
got my shield,

835
00:39:50,605 --> 00:39:53,347
I was the youngest person
on my case.

836
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:57,830
I was the only woman and
I was the only person of color.

837
00:39:57,873 --> 00:40:00,398
And I got frozen out.

838
00:40:02,835 --> 00:40:05,403
But Tommy Webber

839
00:40:05,446 --> 00:40:08,231
took me under his wing,

840
00:40:08,275 --> 00:40:10,886
and he made sure that nobody
treated me as if I was less than

841
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:14,499
and that really
meant a lot to me.

842
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:21,549
So I guess I just kinda took
this case very personally.

843
00:40:23,986 --> 00:40:26,162
I get it.

844
00:40:26,206 --> 00:40:30,036
I think we both did.

845
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:33,605
Tommy sounds like
he was a really great man.

846
00:40:35,911 --> 00:40:38,131
He was.
