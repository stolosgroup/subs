1
00:00:05,089 --> 00:00:06,424
My daughter, Theresa,

2
00:00:06,507 --> 00:00:07,633
she was taken.

3
00:00:07,717 --> 00:00:08,759
Now I know who did it,

4
00:00:08,843 --> 00:00:09,927
but I can't prove that.

5
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:16,934
Parker, your man,
a serial killer.

6
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:19,186
Can't you tell me
the truth, Karen?

7
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:20,855
I never saw her.

8
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:22,565
You ready to be Emma Hall

9
00:00:22,648 --> 00:00:24,066
in witness protection?

10
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:25,901
I don't have to tell you
to stay away

11
00:00:25,985 --> 00:00:27,278
from young women.

12
00:00:28,904 --> 00:00:30,948
You my true friend, Emma Hall.

13
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:35,661
I was a predator,
but now I am well.

14
00:00:35,745 --> 00:00:38,247
I need you
to find someone for me.

15
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:40,374
Christopher Parker's dead.

16
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:41,458
Do you trust me?

17
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:45,784
We're gonna keep
working on the memories

18
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:46,796
that you can't recall.

19
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:48,257
What's your name?

20
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:49,592
Theresa.

21
00:00:57,308 --> 00:00:59,393
She was a girl I met,
a friend...

22
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:01,267
You made a friend already?

23
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:03,385
Some girls were giving her
a hard time...

24
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:04,982
I stepped in for her.

25
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,317
How?

26
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,027
I told them to leave her alone.

27
00:01:15,451 --> 00:01:16,577
She...

28
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:19,330
She's 14.

29
00:01:21,874 --> 00:01:23,709
Her name's Jess.

30
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:39,683
Emma?

31
00:02:18,264 --> 00:02:20,295
So I guess you're trying
to make things look nice

32
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:21,976
before you leave us.

33
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:25,062
I didn't get it... the job.

34
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,939
Oh, John.

35
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:28,899
I'm so sorry.
It was so perfect for you.

36
00:02:28,983 --> 00:02:30,526
You know so much about cars.

37
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:34,905
Yeah, I don't have
the sales experience.

38
00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:36,156
I mean, look at me...

39
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:40,202
Going from frozen food
to selling Chryslers?

40
00:02:41,954 --> 00:02:43,664
Oh, you must've been bad
in a past life.

41
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:45,708
That's why Jana keeps you
out here on frozen.

42
00:02:58,804 --> 00:03:00,723
Love is a virtuous mind
that creates

43
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:02,808
only peace and happiness.

44
00:03:02,892 --> 00:03:04,977
Love is a virtuous mind
that creates

45
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,395
only peace and happiness.

46
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:15,613
She was lying on the ground,

47
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:18,574
and there was blood
on her dress. There...

48
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:21,327
She'd been stabbed.
There was a man in a hood.

49
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:24,204
He grabbed me.
Look, I've got marks.

50
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,748
Yeah, that's a chigger bite.

51
00:03:25,831 --> 00:03:27,374
If you go out and play
in the bayou,

52
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:29,138
you're gonna get cut
and scratched and bit.

53
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:30,961
There's a lot of nature
out there.

54
00:03:31,045 --> 00:03:32,087
It's not a bite.

55
00:03:32,171 --> 00:03:33,464
There's something in there.

56
00:03:40,054 --> 00:03:41,460
You can't drink
on the meds you're taking.

57
00:03:41,472 --> 00:03:42,306
I needed something.

58
00:03:46,936 --> 00:03:48,520
You wanna take a minute
and talk about

59
00:03:48,604 --> 00:03:50,064
why you trashed this place?

60
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:51,815
Does it matter?

61
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:53,859
Well, you think you saw
a dead girl, so yeah.

62
00:03:53,943 --> 00:03:54,943
It does matter.

63
00:03:55,653 --> 00:03:57,279
I told you that
one of the side effects

64
00:03:57,363 --> 00:03:59,907
of the meds that you're on
is hallucinations.

65
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:02,326
So if you drink
while you're taking the meds,

66
00:04:03,077 --> 00:04:05,829
you're gonna have
very vivid hallucinations.

67
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:07,247
You saw a lot of blood.

68
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:08,749
It scared the hell out of you.

69
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:11,377
But in the end,
all you saw was a bird...

70
00:04:12,086 --> 00:04:13,963
- A pelican.
- I saw her.

71
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,715
Pete, I saw her.

72
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:19,468
You and I both know
that you get blackouts.

73
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:22,179
Of things that I don't remember,
not of things that I do.

74
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,710
And we're still trying
to piece together

75
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:25,082
the things
that you don't remember.

76
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:30,020
You're in witness protection
because of Parker.

77
00:04:30,104 --> 00:04:31,730
He killed himself yesterday.

78
00:04:31,814 --> 00:04:33,857
That would unhinge anyone.

79
00:04:35,401 --> 00:04:36,986
So if I imagined it,

80
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:39,571
then she'll still be
where she was, right?

81
00:04:39,655 --> 00:04:41,991
At the...
The group home in town?

82
00:04:42,074 --> 00:04:43,784
What group home?

83
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:44,994
St. Jerome House.

84
00:04:45,077 --> 00:04:46,203
She wasn't happy there,

85
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,287
she wanted to run away.

86
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:56,547
Emma, listen to me.

87
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:59,717
You can't go anywhere near
a place like that ever again.

88
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:04,304
You can't make friends
with vulnerable young girls.

89
00:05:04,388 --> 00:05:06,682
You have a history...
An unfair one...

90
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:09,685
But you have a history
that no one can know about.

91
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:11,061
Do you understand?

92
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:14,314
I need to refill your meds.

93
00:06:25,344 --> 00:06:27,012
"Stress is the most common cause

94
00:06:27,096 --> 00:06:29,723
of an addictive
behavior resurfacing.

95
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:33,644
Anniversaries

96
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,271
and key milestones

97
00:06:36,355 --> 00:06:38,607
"may also trigger relapses."

98
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:19,064
Feels like we're in a movie.

99
00:07:19,857 --> 00:07:22,025
Oh, yeah? Which one?

100
00:07:24,403 --> 00:07:27,739
Um, do you have any tea...
Something, uh, decaf?

101
00:07:27,823 --> 00:07:29,199
We got chamomile.

102
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:32,035
Now I think about it, I guess
it's like a lot of movies...

103
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:34,621
It's hard to narrow it down...

104
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:37,791
Guess I'll just say
"When Harry Met Sally."

105
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:41,211
You're not eating?

106
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,630
Ah, don't let that stop you.

107
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,507
Tea for two.

108
00:07:49,887 --> 00:07:52,431
So, Mrs. Barlow,
I'm still a little unclear

109
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:54,433
about how this would work
in practice,

110
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:58,270
what... what you're looking
for me to do.

111
00:07:59,563 --> 00:08:00,981
When I came to you,

112
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:04,568
um, I was not thinking
very clearly.

113
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:07,321
I'd had a very bad day.

114
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:09,072
I am sorry.

115
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:11,316
And I guess it might seem like
an odd thing to ask for.

116
00:08:12,034 --> 00:08:13,076
It's actually very simple.

117
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,662
I just need you to find her,

118
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:18,582
tell me where Karen Miller is.

119
00:08:20,209 --> 00:08:23,378
I've done some research...

120
00:08:23,462 --> 00:08:24,671
She's gone.

121
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:27,049
She has a new identity.

122
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:28,842
I couldn't find out
who she's become.

123
00:08:28,926 --> 00:08:31,887
I don't have
those kinds of resources.

124
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,388
I'm not a cop.

125
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:37,226
Something has, uh,
stayed with me

126
00:08:38,477 --> 00:08:40,312
ever since you came
to my office.

127
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:43,106
Do you remember
talking about the gap...

128
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,817
The space between what your...

129
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:49,404
victims...

130
00:08:49,488 --> 00:08:51,073
I accept that term.

131
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:54,451
Between what they thought
was safety

132
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,246
and what was safety.

133
00:08:57,913 --> 00:08:59,373
I appreciate that,

134
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:02,834
and I'm flattered
that my words had impact.

135
00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:05,837
But, uh, that was
a different context

136
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:08,257
and I don't feel comfortable
repackaging it.

137
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,092
But you repackaged it.

138
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:16,807
What I mean is,
you found a way to change it up.

139
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:21,937
And now you "know better,
you do better," right?

140
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,563
Bad for good.

141
00:09:23,647 --> 00:09:25,482
I know that might be
a little simplistic.

142
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:26,565
A little.

143
00:09:29,111 --> 00:09:31,822
"He found the things
his victims loved

144
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:35,909
and he used them as a way
to get inside their lives."

145
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:40,872
That was the prosecutor's
closing statement at your trial.

146
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:43,875
Now, I think you could
just as easily

147
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:48,672
apply that technique
to our situation.

148
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:51,717
Find the things
Karen Miller loved.

149
00:09:52,843 --> 00:09:53,885
Find the gap.

150
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:04,062
My number's on that cellphone.

151
00:10:06,857 --> 00:10:10,527
And this is for anything
you might need.

152
00:10:13,864 --> 00:10:15,699
The credit card of executives.

153
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:17,951
It's a debit.

154
00:10:19,036 --> 00:10:20,078
Oh.

155
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:22,706
I think you're the man
for the job, John.

156
00:10:25,876 --> 00:10:27,336
So I gotta go.

157
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:29,546
Can you, uh, pick this up?

158
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:30,629
On expenses?

159
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:40,724
Yeah.

160
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,658
Oh, my God, Rose,
what happened?

161
00:10:59,743 --> 00:11:00,994
Girl.

162
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:02,788
Hey, Emma, this is Rose,

163
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,040
her family's
a big part of this town.

164
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:07,334
They practically rebuilt us
after Katrina.

165
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:09,961
Hi.

166
00:11:10,045 --> 00:11:11,797
And, Rose,
the answer's still no.

167
00:11:12,506 --> 00:11:13,995
Your mama wants your hair
long and pretty

168
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:15,509
for the Festival of Saints.

169
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:16,968
You don't know my mother, right?

170
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:19,930
So you'll do it.

171
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:21,890
You don't know my work...
It's quite a risk.

172
00:11:31,775 --> 00:11:33,151
Don't turn her into no punk.

173
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:37,072
What kind of coffee you want?

174
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:38,281
I'll take a decaf.

175
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:40,409
Cream or no cream?

176
00:11:40,492 --> 00:11:41,618
No cream.

177
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:54,923
You gonna make trouble for me?

178
00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:58,301
I don't know yet.

179
00:12:13,275 --> 00:12:14,693
Angela Miller?

180
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:16,611
Did your daughter help him?

181
00:12:18,113 --> 00:12:20,115
Did your daughter help him?

182
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:21,638
Is it true you struggle
with alcohol?

183
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,993
Are you still drinking?

184
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:54,274
You have deep indentations...

185
00:12:56,151 --> 00:12:57,611
Were you a difficult birth?

186
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:00,530
You get a lot of migraines?

187
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:04,951
When some bitch slams my head
against the mirror.

188
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:10,332
Why'd you call her trash?

189
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:11,541
Does it matter?

190
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:15,253
Are you a friend of hers
or something?

191
00:13:15,337 --> 00:13:16,963
I've never seen you here before.

192
00:13:17,047 --> 00:13:18,256
What do you want from me?

193
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:20,634
New look.

194
00:13:21,885 --> 00:13:23,845
Something to go with my nose.

195
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,753
Sure I don't have to check
with your mother first?

196
00:13:26,765 --> 00:13:28,171
Do you have to check
with Georgia to make sure

197
00:13:28,183 --> 00:13:29,223
you're safe with scissors?

198
00:13:31,937 --> 00:13:33,104
Why did you do it?

199
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:35,899
I didn't like
what you called her.

200
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:38,693
I don't know whether that
makes you scary or amazing.

201
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:47,661
We've got to get going
right now.

202
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:48,744
Yeah.

203
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:52,749
We are so grateful
you're able to do this, Mary.

204
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,459
Are you kidding? Of course.

205
00:13:54,543 --> 00:13:57,003
We're all appreciative
of your commitment.

206
00:13:57,087 --> 00:13:58,755
We've have had a little luck...

207
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,258
Larissa Barbola,
Connie's mother.

208
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:03,134
You know Larissa, right?

209
00:14:03,218 --> 00:14:04,719
We're gonna go across
to her now.

210
00:14:04,803 --> 00:14:06,429
So you're gonna do
a split screen?

211
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:09,099
We're actually heading
straight to Larissa's place.

212
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:10,850
You're bumping me?

213
00:14:10,934 --> 00:14:12,435
Christopher Parker admitted

214
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:13,770
to Connie's murder...

215
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,397
She's a confirmed victim.

216
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,065
Look, Larissa is great,

217
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:19,276
and all that matters is
we're talking about

218
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:20,359
Parker and Miller again.

219
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:28,493
Will you get these people
out of my house?

220
00:14:28,577 --> 00:14:29,577
Yeah.

221
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:22,839
- Hey.
- Hey.

222
00:15:25,634 --> 00:15:26,926
You're a cop?

223
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:29,095
I'm gonna be a detective.

224
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:32,766
I'm just waiting for the
opportunity to present itself.

225
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:33,849
Ah!

226
00:15:34,476 --> 00:15:35,476
You okay?

227
00:15:36,645 --> 00:15:38,104
Can I get a ride?

228
00:15:38,188 --> 00:15:39,481
I'm out on the Longbank.

229
00:15:43,485 --> 00:15:45,362
I think he dodged
this bullet.

230
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:47,485
Because of the brutal
murder of your daughter.

231
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:50,659
I'm sorry.

232
00:15:50,742 --> 00:15:52,369
Look,
I don't blame Larissa.

233
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:54,150
I mean, my God, I feel like
crying every day, too.

234
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:56,790
But she is literally
turn-up-and-cry mom,

235
00:15:56,873 --> 00:16:00,085
whereas I don't...
I don't cry on cue.

236
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:02,379
That's why they bumped me.

237
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:05,548
I mean, they all but said
there's a ranking system.

238
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:07,050
You should have
pushed them on that.

239
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:08,573
You acted like
you were fine with it.

240
00:16:09,052 --> 00:16:10,720
Because I can't look like
an asshole.

241
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:12,931
I'm not saying
you have to do a ceremony

242
00:16:13,014 --> 00:16:15,767
or officially mourn...
I know you're not there...

243
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:18,103
But maybe think about
the vigil...

244
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:20,814
Why don't you just make it
something small,

245
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:22,607
personal, healing...

246
00:16:22,691 --> 00:16:24,984
Don't make it about anyone else.

247
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:26,528
You, me, and Dad
go to Holy Trinity

248
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:28,154
and stand around a candle,

249
00:16:28,238 --> 00:16:30,532
and say nice things
to each other.

250
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:33,827
Let's just remember
what this guy did.

251
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:39,708
He abducted women,
he kept them in his van,

252
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:43,002
and he bashed in their faces
with a claw hammer.

253
00:16:43,086 --> 00:16:44,713
I don't want to remember.

254
00:16:44,796 --> 00:16:47,549
Okay, I don't want my head
full of that shit.

255
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:49,592
Have fun talking to the TV, Mom.

256
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:52,679
I'm gonna grab a little bit
of the life that's hurrying by.

257
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:58,727
A St. J girl...
Tina Monro...

258
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:00,353
Gone off grid,

259
00:17:00,437 --> 00:17:02,439
- Tina Monro, 15...
- This isn't my car.

260
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:05,400
Hispanic, 5'6",
dark-brown hair...

261
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:08,027
I got eyes on the River Road.

262
00:17:10,155 --> 00:17:11,489
St. J is what?

263
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:13,408
Saint James?

264
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:15,952
St. Jerome.

265
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:19,456
It's a group home
on the edge of town.

266
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:20,999
And a girl's missing from there?

267
00:17:21,082 --> 00:17:22,917
Sometimes a kid disappears
for a night.

268
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:25,545
Mostly they come back
before breakfast.

269
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:26,963
"Mostly"?

270
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,494
What, some of the girls
don't come back?

271
00:17:30,508 --> 00:17:31,634
Shit.

272
00:17:32,594 --> 00:17:33,970
That... That looks bad.

273
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,555
It's fine.

274
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:38,349
- It's just a sting.
- No, that's infected.

275
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:40,518
You need to see someone.
I can take you to a doctor.

276
00:17:40,602 --> 00:17:42,437
Mmm-mmm. I don't need a doctor.

277
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,439
Okay, well,
then I'll look at it myself.

278
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:52,405
- Ow! Ow!
- Okay, okay. I... um...

279
00:17:52,489 --> 00:17:54,157
- So you're from Seattle?
- Mmm-hmm.

280
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:56,743
- Aah!
- Do you miss it?

281
00:17:58,828 --> 00:17:59,829
No, I don't.

282
00:18:01,372 --> 00:18:02,874
I try to stay in the moment.

283
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:05,835
Ow!

284
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,171
Oh, God, just get it out!
Ow! Ow!

285
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:10,507
Oh, God!

286
00:18:13,218 --> 00:18:16,095
Whoa, what is that? A needle?

287
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:29,484
I got sober
five years ago.

288
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:33,238
That's why I'm alive.

289
00:18:33,321 --> 00:18:34,697
That's all I can say.

290
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:35,907
I'm, uh,

291
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:38,576
I'm breathing.

292
00:18:41,538 --> 00:18:43,081
I'm still sober.

293
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,627
Thank you, Angela.

294
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:49,754
There's a lot of love
and light around you.

295
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:54,092
Anyone else like to share?

296
00:18:54,175 --> 00:18:57,804
Uh, hi. I'm John,
and I'm an alcoholic.

297
00:18:57,887 --> 00:18:58,972
- Hi, John.
- Hello, John.

298
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:01,683
I'm five years sober now, too.

299
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:03,059
So jinx.

300
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:20,606
Don't know what I would do
without those meetings.

301
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:22,245
Yeah.

302
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,330
Jinx.

303
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,252
I'm gonna sit down now.

304
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:30,962
Are you okay? Oh, my God!

305
00:19:31,045 --> 00:19:33,381
- I'm okay.
- Oh, my God, no.

306
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:34,883
I'm all right.
This happens to me.

307
00:19:34,966 --> 00:19:36,050
Are you all right?

308
00:19:38,428 --> 00:19:40,513
I'm so sorry. Please go.

309
00:19:40,597 --> 00:19:43,266
No, no, no. Uh, look,
do you want some water,

310
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:45,393
or what can I do for y...?

311
00:19:46,311 --> 00:19:47,979
I'm so embarrassed right now.

312
00:19:48,605 --> 00:19:50,940
Um, could you hold my legs
for me, please?

313
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:52,442
Oh. Uh...

314
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:53,985
Just so I can get the blood...

315
00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:56,362
- No, no.
- I haven't been drinking.

316
00:19:57,488 --> 00:19:59,866
Hi, I'm John. I'm a fainter.

317
00:20:01,451 --> 00:20:03,786
I'm a dentist...
I get a lot of fainters.

318
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:06,748
You need to eat something.

319
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:07,831
Okay?

320
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:11,419
It wasn't the medication,
it wasn't a hallucination.

321
00:20:11,502 --> 00:20:12,658
It happened, Pete.
This happened.

322
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:14,797
I... I remember the man...

323
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:17,300
I remember
he grabbed my leg, and...

324
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:19,540
And then I felt this pain and
now I know it was the needle.

325
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:21,429
The needle that I have
right in front of me.

326
00:20:21,512 --> 00:20:23,598
So if that was real,
then Jess was real too.

327
00:20:23,681 --> 00:20:26,100
Emma, I need you to take
a breath, all right?

328
00:20:26,184 --> 00:20:28,561
Now, I'm gonna come see you
tomorrow and we're gonna work

329
00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:29,842
- this whole thing out.
- No, Pete, I need you

330
00:20:29,854 --> 00:20:31,397
to call the police now,

331
00:20:31,481 --> 00:20:33,054
and I need you to have them
go to St. Jerome

332
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:34,734
and check her room.
Just check her room.

333
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:36,474
No. We're not calling
the police, all right?

334
00:20:36,486 --> 00:20:38,184
And we're not gonna talk
to them about a girl

335
00:20:38,196 --> 00:20:39,489
that you think is dead.

336
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:40,782
No, I don't think she's dead!

337
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:42,825
I know what I saw.

338
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:44,577
Jess is dead
and there's a man out there

339
00:20:44,661 --> 00:20:46,329
who knows that I saw it too,

340
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:48,277
so if you're not gonna
deal with this, then I will.

341
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:49,916
You do anything
and you're gonna get

342
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:52,168
a big red flag
above your head, okay?

343
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,461
I'll look into it.

344
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:56,547
It's called
the St. Jerome House.

345
00:20:56,631 --> 00:20:58,841
It's on the edge of town,
I don't know the address.

346
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:02,261
Okay. I'll call them.

347
00:21:02,804 --> 00:21:03,804
Though I'm pretty sure

348
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:05,968
they're not gonna give
information out to a stranger.

349
00:21:06,516 --> 00:21:08,559
Do me a favor...
Take your pills,

350
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:12,438
go to bed, and just stay there.

351
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:17,860
So, I was thinking
about my dad today.

352
00:21:17,944 --> 00:21:20,029
And I remembered
this thing he would do.

353
00:21:20,113 --> 00:21:21,572
It's like he always thought

354
00:21:21,656 --> 00:21:23,324
I had a motive.

355
00:21:23,408 --> 00:21:26,536
I remembered this one time
I was probably six.

356
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:28,496
He went out to buy candy
for my mom.

357
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:29,902
I don't know, maybe he
was trying to get her into bed.

358
00:21:29,914 --> 00:21:31,708
Anyway, I went with him,

359
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:35,003
and he literally bought
a stack of candy bars, like...

360
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,923
Pete, are you even listening?

361
00:21:39,007 --> 00:21:40,466
Totally. Your dad, candy...

362
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:42,593
Baby, you've told me this story.

363
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:46,806
I can't tell you
something twice?

364
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:48,337
Of course you can.
You can tell me a million times.

365
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:50,101
All I'm saying is
that I remember.

366
00:21:50,184 --> 00:21:51,184
And it's more than twice.

367
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:57,817
Your dad, the ride home

368
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,932
where you were the best
little girl in the world, hmm?

369
00:21:59,944 --> 00:22:01,726
'Cause you wanted the candy,
but your dad made you feel like

370
00:22:01,738 --> 00:22:04,073
that was unnatural...
Like it was a bad thing, hmm?

371
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:08,745
You dad made you feel like you
always had an ulterior motive,

372
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:10,913
and this makes you feel like
you're not genuine.

373
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,780
But you still wanted that candy,

374
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:17,253
didn't you?

375
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,047
Yes, of course
I wanted the candy,

376
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:21,591
because what child
doesn't want the candy?

377
00:22:24,719 --> 00:22:25,719
Hey.

378
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:30,808
You used to want
to listen to me.

379
00:22:30,892 --> 00:22:33,603
You used to pay me $100 an hour
to listen to you.

380
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:35,772
Well, I'll leave the money
on the bedside,

381
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:37,523
you mercenary shit.

382
00:22:40,026 --> 00:22:41,026
Thank you.

383
00:22:43,988 --> 00:22:45,656
- And now you're feeding me.
- Hmm.

384
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:50,078
I feel comforted
yet infantilized.

385
00:22:50,161 --> 00:22:52,205
Hashtag secretly loving it.

386
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:54,040
It's a way to make
an impression.

387
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:56,417
Uh, it's a meeting thing.

388
00:22:56,501 --> 00:22:58,419
I really have a hard time
speaking in public.

389
00:22:58,503 --> 00:23:00,379
And actually,

390
00:23:00,463 --> 00:23:03,091
I usually faint before talking,

391
00:23:03,174 --> 00:23:05,802
and this time
I put my audience first.

392
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:07,095
Show goes on.

393
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:09,222
And you go down?

394
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:10,348
Apparently so.

395
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:20,900
I feel ashamed.

396
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:22,151
I have a daughter.

397
00:23:22,985 --> 00:23:24,403
I messed her up.

398
00:23:28,866 --> 00:23:31,244
Well, if it makes you feel
any better, I, uh...

399
00:23:32,286 --> 00:23:34,539
I have a daughter
and I messed her up, too.

400
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:38,584
Excuse me. Could I have
some water, please.

401
00:23:38,668 --> 00:23:39,668
Of course.

402
00:23:41,838 --> 00:23:43,077
I'm sure you're being
hard on yourself.

403
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:44,298
Do you see her?

404
00:23:44,382 --> 00:23:45,382
Thank you.

405
00:23:52,849 --> 00:23:54,183
So, what's your daughter's name?

406
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,563
Theresa.

407
00:24:00,857 --> 00:24:01,941
It's pretty.

408
00:24:08,156 --> 00:24:09,365
Do you smoke?

409
00:24:25,673 --> 00:24:27,508
I let my daughter drive me home.

410
00:24:29,051 --> 00:24:31,262
There was a lot of ice
on the road.

411
00:24:31,345 --> 00:24:33,848
We hit a tree. Police came.

412
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:39,896
She's 14 and I'm trashed.

413
00:24:41,439 --> 00:24:45,026
So right there and then
I'm an unfit mother.

414
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:48,696
It was our last night together.

415
00:24:51,199 --> 00:24:52,700
Hey, I was... I was so out of it

416
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:56,037
I forgot to get my daughter
from summer camp.

417
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,998
And she got a ride home
with a stranger.

418
00:24:59,081 --> 00:25:01,167
Something happened.
She never told me what.

419
00:25:02,126 --> 00:25:03,586
But she told my wife,

420
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:06,631
and I have, uh,
never seen her again.

421
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:08,466
What's her name?

422
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:10,176
Uh, your wife I mean.

423
00:25:12,261 --> 00:25:13,261
Mary.

424
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:15,223
Mary.

425
00:25:21,354 --> 00:25:25,107
Uh, I didn't know
you got ice in Texas.

426
00:25:25,191 --> 00:25:27,109
No, it was Minnesota...

427
00:25:27,193 --> 00:25:29,820
I was seeing this guy up there.

428
00:25:29,904 --> 00:25:32,156
So my daughter went
into foster care.

429
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,076
And, uh, it was supposed
to be temporary...

430
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:38,120
She'd... she'd come back to me
when she wanted.

431
00:25:38,913 --> 00:25:39,914
But, um...

432
00:25:42,667 --> 00:25:44,252
I guess she never wanted to.

433
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:47,964
So I'm a grieving mother

434
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:50,132
and a bad mother

435
00:25:50,216 --> 00:25:54,887
and, um, I traded my alcohol
for cigarettes,

436
00:25:54,971 --> 00:25:55,972
but...

437
00:25:57,974 --> 00:26:00,643
You are a good person, Angela.

438
00:26:04,188 --> 00:26:05,189
You're sweet.

439
00:26:06,023 --> 00:26:07,023
Mmm-mmm.

440
00:26:10,444 --> 00:26:11,904
I raised a monster.

441
00:26:16,867 --> 00:26:18,327
My daughter got
into some trouble.

442
00:26:18,411 --> 00:26:22,123
So whenever anybody
dredges something up

443
00:26:22,206 --> 00:26:24,166
or there's a significant date,

444
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:27,920
I get a, um,
redecoration of my house

445
00:26:28,004 --> 00:26:30,631
by the sanctimonious
little shits in town.

446
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:35,094
So move.

447
00:26:35,177 --> 00:26:37,680
You are a good person, Angela.

448
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:08,502
Emma, please, I need you!

449
00:27:17,261 --> 00:27:18,846
He thinks I'm fixed.

450
00:27:19,764 --> 00:27:21,474
He thinks he fixed me.

451
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:25,019
Pete likes to be the savior.

452
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:27,271
And if I tell him about you,

453
00:27:27,355 --> 00:27:30,399
he's gonna wonder why I need you
and what I tell you.

454
00:27:30,483 --> 00:27:32,818
Are there things he doesn't
want you to share with me?

455
00:27:34,195 --> 00:27:35,863
You know,
that's the crazy thing.

456
00:27:36,489 --> 00:27:38,699
He has all my secrets...

457
00:27:39,408 --> 00:27:41,202
All the things I told him...

458
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:43,871
But all that time
it was about me,

459
00:27:44,914 --> 00:27:46,082
never him.

460
00:27:48,501 --> 00:27:50,127
And I thought that was love.

461
00:27:50,211 --> 00:27:52,171
And what do you think it is now?

462
00:27:53,047 --> 00:27:54,047
Power.

463
00:27:54,757 --> 00:27:55,757
Over you?

464
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:59,345
I don't think
he thinks of me at all.

465
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:01,472
He's there, in the house,

466
00:28:03,057 --> 00:28:04,225
but he isn't present...

467
00:28:04,975 --> 00:28:06,102
He doesn't see me.

468
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:07,728
So why do you stay, Lisa?

469
00:28:07,812 --> 00:28:09,355
If you don't feel loved or seen?

470
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:11,482
For my daughter.

471
00:28:12,817 --> 00:28:14,318
She's my miracle.

472
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:19,490
And he loves her,
he makes her feel safe.

473
00:28:21,367 --> 00:28:24,954
Girls without fathers
are afraid of the world.

474
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:27,540
And what about girls
with bad fathers?

475
00:28:27,623 --> 00:28:29,083
He's not a bad father.

476
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,086
He's just not a good husband.

477
00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:35,047
And what about girls
with bad fathers?

478
00:28:35,131 --> 00:28:36,715
He's not a bad father.

479
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:39,468
He's just not a good husband.

480
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:40,803
So who do you turn to,

481
00:28:40,886 --> 00:28:42,888
when you get your nightmares?

482
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:46,183
Because you do still get them,
don't you?

483
00:28:47,518 --> 00:28:48,644
My daughter.

484
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:50,229
Want this back in there?

485
00:28:50,312 --> 00:28:51,480
I hold her.

486
00:28:52,773 --> 00:28:54,233
I feel her heartbeat.

487
00:28:54,316 --> 00:28:55,943
Till it's just her and me...

488
00:28:57,778 --> 00:28:59,697
And those memories are gone.

489
00:29:06,579 --> 00:29:07,609
You brought the other parents?

490
00:29:07,621 --> 00:29:09,331
I had to make this count.

491
00:29:09,415 --> 00:29:11,917
This was just supposed to be us,
something quiet.

492
00:29:12,585 --> 00:29:14,211
Quiet's not gonna
find your sister.

493
00:29:14,295 --> 00:29:16,005
- Mary, hey.
- Hi.

494
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:17,131
- Hi, Mary.
- Hi.

495
00:29:18,591 --> 00:29:20,759
- Thanks for coming, Mary.
- Thank you.

496
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,598
- How are you?
- I'm good.

497
00:29:25,681 --> 00:29:26,932
You good?

498
00:29:27,016 --> 00:29:28,058
Oh.

499
00:29:28,142 --> 00:29:29,351
Nice to see you.

500
00:29:29,435 --> 00:29:30,686
Thank you.

501
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:39,361
Thank you. Thank you.

502
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:41,655
Please, please be seated.

503
00:29:41,739 --> 00:29:43,365
Thank you so much for coming.

504
00:29:45,201 --> 00:29:49,079
Janice Dunne
doesn't get married.

505
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:53,834
Martha Schulz can't kiss
her daddy goodbye...

506
00:29:53,918 --> 00:29:56,003
He's already gone from cancer.

507
00:29:56,629 --> 00:30:01,717
Marissa Watkins
doesn't get to be an Auntie.

508
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:05,554
Diane Lapsley doesn't finish
her paper on genetics.

509
00:30:06,222 --> 00:30:10,768
Laura Danone doesn't
start her new job,

510
00:30:10,851 --> 00:30:14,522
and Connie Barbola's not there
when her grandfather dies.

511
00:30:15,314 --> 00:30:18,651
I want to remember their names,

512
00:30:19,527 --> 00:30:22,488
not just the name of the man
who took them from us.

513
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:25,991
All these mothers,
all these fathers behind me...

514
00:30:26,075 --> 00:30:30,412
They felt something when
they lost their daughters...

515
00:30:31,205 --> 00:30:32,581
An instinct.

516
00:30:34,375 --> 00:30:37,670
Trust it, listen to your gut.

517
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,549
Look for my daughter.

518
00:30:44,093 --> 00:30:46,595
Remember a night seven years ago

519
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:49,098
and a gas station in Nevada

520
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:52,560
when she was in the same place
at the same time

521
00:30:52,643 --> 00:30:55,729
as the man
who killed all these women.

522
00:30:55,813 --> 00:30:58,274
What happened to her

523
00:30:59,525 --> 00:31:00,985
when she drove away?

524
00:31:01,819 --> 00:31:03,779
My daughter is out there.

525
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:13,664
Other people's daughters
who may have been taken

526
00:31:13,747 --> 00:31:16,125
by this man are out there too.

527
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:19,545
But we won't give up.

528
00:31:20,296 --> 00:31:23,674
We remember you
and we will find you.

529
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:05,736
Do you believe in
an afterlife?

530
00:32:07,593 --> 00:32:09,386
Because you finished
your Milky Way

531
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:11,347
and you wonder
where candy bars go?

532
00:32:12,723 --> 00:32:14,016
I can be deep.

533
00:32:16,143 --> 00:32:20,147
I look at the stars and I think,
"Is that where we go?"

534
00:32:20,814 --> 00:32:22,524
I believe in a soul...

535
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:24,360
A pure center.

536
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:26,695
Like the light in that star.

537
00:32:28,322 --> 00:32:31,450
Which one, that one...

538
00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:33,202
The other one.

539
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:35,287
- That little one?
- The one next to it.

540
00:32:37,206 --> 00:32:39,583
Which, that?

541
00:32:39,667 --> 00:32:41,960
Not that one?

542
00:32:48,509 --> 00:32:50,803
I believe you have to honor
your soul,

543
00:32:54,556 --> 00:32:56,850
process it out...
So it has a path to travel,

544
00:32:56,934 --> 00:33:00,479
not just lost in the dark.

545
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:06,151
Is that a yes?

546
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:11,031
You could've just said yes.

547
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:26,046
Will you burn me when I'm gone?

548
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:30,884
You're not going anywhere.

549
00:33:30,968 --> 00:33:32,261
Stay with me.

550
00:33:54,116 --> 00:33:55,116
No.

551
00:33:57,411 --> 00:33:58,411
Here.

552
00:34:01,832 --> 00:34:03,500
I don't want to be a question.

553
00:34:04,626 --> 00:34:05,627
You're a puzzle.

554
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,049
You know it's love.

555
00:34:48,837 --> 00:34:50,757
So your soul doesn't wander.

556
00:34:52,007 --> 00:34:54,551
So you have a place up there,
with the stars.

557
00:34:55,552 --> 00:34:57,221
This is how I honor you.

558
00:36:24,641 --> 00:36:25,684
You need a ride?

559
00:36:26,643 --> 00:36:28,061
Come on, get in.

560
00:36:28,145 --> 00:36:29,730
It's late. It's raining.

561
00:36:29,813 --> 00:36:31,440
It's not safe for you
to be out here

562
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:32,858
on the side of the road
like this.

563
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:34,401
I prefer to walk.

564
00:36:36,904 --> 00:36:38,530
You're one of those girls,
aren't you?

565
00:36:40,407 --> 00:36:41,617
From the group home.

566
00:36:43,076 --> 00:36:44,476
What are you doing
out here tonight?

567
00:36:47,497 --> 00:36:48,790
Who are you, mister?

568
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:50,792
I'm just a friend of a friend.

569
00:36:52,002 --> 00:36:53,003
Are you okay?

570
00:37:41,718 --> 00:37:45,222
Do you know
how disappointing it is

571
00:37:45,305 --> 00:37:47,474
not to be able
to trust you, Rose?

572
00:37:47,557 --> 00:37:51,353
All we want is for you
to look and do your best.

573
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,399
Daddy likes my hair.

574
00:37:57,818 --> 00:37:58,818
Mom, don't.

575
00:38:00,404 --> 00:38:02,572
- Until you can be trusted...
- Please.

576
00:38:06,952 --> 00:38:08,745
You cannot be trusted.

577
00:38:08,829 --> 00:38:10,080
Don't lock me in, Mom.

578
00:38:10,163 --> 00:38:11,707
Don't lock me in, please!

579
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:55,125
Tina, we've been looking
all over for you.

580
00:38:55,208 --> 00:38:57,377
- Mmm-hmm.
- What are you playing at,

581
00:38:57,461 --> 00:38:58,783
- young lady?
- Go to hell.

582
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:27,115
More.

583
00:39:28,241 --> 00:39:30,285
Actually, I don't think I can.

584
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:32,704
I got a cramp in my jaw.

585
00:39:34,498 --> 00:39:35,874
Work it out, Adam.

586
00:40:04,736 --> 00:40:06,488
This is...
This is work, I gotta...

587
00:40:06,571 --> 00:40:07,571
Gotta take it.

588
00:40:08,657 --> 00:40:10,492
Hello?

589
00:40:10,575 --> 00:40:12,327
Uh, Mrs. Barlow?
This is John Tyler.

590
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,287
Did you find something,
from her mother?

591
00:40:14,371 --> 00:40:17,165
No, there's
no relationship there.

592
00:40:17,249 --> 00:40:20,669
No link back to Karen
through her mother.

593
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:21,837
Then what do you have?

594
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,297
She was, uh, fostered.

595
00:40:26,883 --> 00:40:28,009
Mrs. Barlow?

596
00:40:28,093 --> 00:40:29,511
Where was the foster home?

597
00:40:29,594 --> 00:40:30,971
In Minnesota.

598
00:40:31,054 --> 00:40:33,014
It... It seems
a very strong link.

599
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,102
John, this is good.

600
00:40:37,185 --> 00:40:39,187
I'm really glad
that I could be of help.

601
00:40:39,271 --> 00:40:41,273
When can you leave
for Minnesota?

602
00:40:41,356 --> 00:40:43,358
No. Uh, we've had
a misunderstanding.

603
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:45,026
I can't leave Texas.

604
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:47,404
I'd be breaching
the terms of my parole.

605
00:40:47,487 --> 00:40:49,327
And I worked very hard
to get my early release,

606
00:40:49,406 --> 00:40:50,866
so I would never
jeopardize that.

607
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:54,619
I'm sorry.
I... I don't make the rules.

608
00:40:54,703 --> 00:40:56,454
You have nothing to worry about.

609
00:40:56,538 --> 00:40:59,374
I have a lot of
influential friends,

610
00:41:00,125 --> 00:41:02,544
I'll square it up
with your parole officer,

611
00:41:02,627 --> 00:41:04,296
make him understand this.

612
00:41:04,379 --> 00:41:05,881
- Or her?
- Or her.

613
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:08,884
But you understand my point?

614
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:12,554
You need to get to Minnesota.

615
00:41:13,263 --> 00:41:14,931
You're good at this.

616
00:41:16,016 --> 00:41:20,604
You're helping me, John,
and you're flourishing.

617
00:41:47,297 --> 00:41:48,840
I'm so proud of you, Mom.

618
00:41:49,925 --> 00:41:50,926
We got a call...

619
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:52,802
Somebody saw the vigil.

620
00:41:52,886 --> 00:41:54,888
There was another girl
who was never found.

621
00:41:54,971 --> 00:41:56,348
Just like Theresa.

622
00:41:57,849 --> 00:41:59,684
You were right to not give up.

623
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,777
I thought you was Jessie.

624
00:42:09,569 --> 00:42:10,649
You should be asleep.

625
00:42:11,404 --> 00:42:12,614
I can't sleep.

626
00:42:13,698 --> 00:42:15,992
Jessie had the sense
to keep going.

627
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:19,871
She's gonna make a life
for herself out there.

628
00:42:19,955 --> 00:42:21,164
So, 'night.

629
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:26,878
You should go too,
'cause we got the devil here.

630
00:42:32,884 --> 00:42:34,636
It was weird. He was...

631
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:38,223
He was kinda odd,
but he was kinda nice too.

632
00:42:39,975 --> 00:42:41,893
I mean, he's in recovery, but...

633
00:42:43,186 --> 00:42:44,521
Anyway, I'm not...

634
00:42:45,188 --> 00:42:46,856
I'm not looking for something.

635
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:50,277
I, uh, I think I'm gonna sell.

636
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:54,114
She's not coming back.

637
00:42:57,075 --> 00:42:59,119
Karen's never coming home again.

638
00:43:28,023 --> 00:43:30,317
If you do a bad thing
and don't feel bad afterwards,

639
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,444
is it still a bad thing?

640
00:43:32,527 --> 00:43:33,945
If you do a bad thing

641
00:43:34,029 --> 00:43:35,655
and don't feel bad afterwards...

642
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:52,088
I don't want to be
a question.

643
00:44:26,581 --> 00:44:28,208
Hey, this is Jess.

644
00:44:28,291 --> 00:44:29,834
Leave a message.

645
00:44:29,918 --> 00:44:31,544
I'm gonna find out
what happened.

646
00:44:32,879 --> 00:44:34,339
The truth about everything.

647
00:44:36,633 --> 00:44:38,134
Because I'm not crazy,

648
00:44:39,052 --> 00:44:41,554
and I know what I saw.

649
00:44:47,143 --> 00:44:49,187
Because I've seen it before.

650
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:53,149
I just... I just don't know
how to make sense of it.

651
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:14,754
But I'm gonna find out
what happened to you.

652
00:45:14,838 --> 00:45:16,756
I'm gonna make this right.

653
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:18,383
I promise you.

654
00:45:18,466 --> 00:45:20,802
Because I don't want
to be afraid anymore.

655
00:45:20,885 --> 00:45:23,012
It's dangerous to be afraid.

656
00:46:00,842 --> 00:46:02,302
Tell me a story.
