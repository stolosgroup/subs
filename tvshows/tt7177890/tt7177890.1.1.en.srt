OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN
from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn

2
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:53,262
Do you remember me?

3
00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:54,597
From the trial.

4
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,265
Of course.

5
00:00:57,641 --> 00:00:59,852
You came every day,
sat in the same seat.

6
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:02,188
Do you have any idea
how hard it was

7
00:01:02,271 --> 00:01:04,732
for the parents to... to listen?

8
00:01:06,275 --> 00:01:07,693
I can't imagine.

9
00:01:10,196 --> 00:01:13,407
I write to him, to Parker,

10
00:01:13,491 --> 00:01:16,410
every week, but he won't see me.

11
00:01:20,915 --> 00:01:22,750
Can you tell me
the truth, Karen?

12
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:26,378
Can you tell me what you know
about my daughter?

13
00:01:26,462 --> 00:01:28,005
Please.

14
00:01:29,298 --> 00:01:30,341
I never saw her.

15
00:01:32,968 --> 00:01:35,012
And I never knew her.

16
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:36,347
Look at these pictures.

17
00:01:37,723 --> 00:01:38,891
Please.

18
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:44,772
I think you need to know
she was really someone.

19
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:47,316
That her first word was "mama,"

20
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:49,693
and she used to fall asleep

21
00:01:49,777 --> 00:01:52,530
on my husband's chest
when she was little,

22
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:54,240
curled up on the couch.

23
00:01:55,491 --> 00:01:58,828
And she grew up
and she swam for her college.

24
00:01:58,911 --> 00:02:01,330
She was very,
very close to Olympic selection,

25
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:03,332
and now it's just, like...

26
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:07,169
It's like I dreamed her.

27
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:11,090
I'm so sorry...

28
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:16,345
...for your loss.

29
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:22,726
I hired
a private investigator, and...

30
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:27,398
we found these three years ago

31
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:30,150
at a gas station in Nevada.

32
00:02:30,234 --> 00:02:33,279
It's... It's the last
image of her.

33
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,994
And then three seconds later,

34
00:02:40,077 --> 00:02:43,414
this man came out
of the bathroom.

35
00:02:43,455 --> 00:02:46,083
Your man.

36
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:47,877
The tattoo artist...

37
00:02:49,962 --> 00:02:51,964
right there.

38
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:54,550
So, one of you is lying.

39
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:56,218
I didn't know him then.

40
00:02:58,596 --> 00:03:00,180
A serial killer...

41
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:04,184
right next to her,
and my baby never comes home.

42
00:03:08,314 --> 00:03:10,399
Can you really not remember?

43
00:03:13,027 --> 00:03:14,945
Oh, no, no.

44
00:03:15,029 --> 00:03:17,281
Sorry, I just... I just...
I just want to...

45
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:19,158
I-I just want to know the truth!

46
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:21,327
Karen! Please!

47
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:23,162
Tell me the truth!

48
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:27,499
Please tell me the truth.

49
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:33,459
You ready, Karen?

50
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:35,836
For what?

51
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,963
To be Emma.

52
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:12,141
This place, it's really mine?

53
00:07:12,558 --> 00:07:14,560
There's a lot of stuff here.

54
00:07:14,643 --> 00:07:17,229
Yeah, there was a guy
that was living here.

55
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:18,939
He's gone now.

56
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:21,233
I'm gonna help you
get through this.

57
00:07:22,651 --> 00:07:24,224
We're still gonna have
our regular sessions

58
00:07:24,236 --> 00:07:25,934
and we're gonna keep
working on the memories

59
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:27,072
that you can't recall.

60
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:30,951
I just don't want you
to get overwhelmed.

61
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:32,202
OK?

62
00:07:35,581 --> 00:07:36,623
OK.

63
00:07:39,001 --> 00:07:41,753
We talked a lot about this
when you were in prison,

64
00:07:41,837 --> 00:07:44,089
about the reality of you
living in...

65
00:07:44,173 --> 00:07:45,549
In Witness Protection.

66
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:48,760
You need to live
a quiet life here,

67
00:07:48,844 --> 00:07:50,554
not attract attention
to yourself,

68
00:07:50,721 --> 00:07:53,265
and be very careful
who you form attachments to.

69
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:57,269
I don't have to tell you
to stay away from young women.

70
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:02,065
I'm just saying, keep it simple.

71
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:04,443
Nine times out of ten,

72
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:06,445
people will believe
what you tell them.

73
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:09,071
You know that.

74
00:08:10,616 --> 00:08:11,992
My number's in that phone.

75
00:08:13,202 --> 00:08:15,579
I want you to keep it with you
at all times.

76
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,706
Most people don't ever get
the opportunity

77
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:19,124
that you have right now.

78
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:23,712
No past, no baggage,

79
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:26,715
and at the same time,
the opposite is true.

80
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:30,010
Every good thing you ever did
is gone.

81
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,348
Tell me about Emma Hall.

82
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:36,767
Write down three things,

83
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:39,394
three qualities
that you want for her.

84
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:42,981
What, like, I get to be a...

85
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:45,149
princess with a unicorn?

86
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:46,610
Write them down.

87
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:30,404
Did you finish the letter
to him?

88
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:33,740
To Parker?

89
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:45,896
It's been seven years
since your daughter,

90
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:48,982
since Theresa went missing,

91
00:10:49,066 --> 00:10:54,404
and that is a very significant
amount of time.

92
00:10:54,488 --> 00:10:59,743
Officially, missing persons
can be declared as deceased,

93
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:02,662
and it's natural

94
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:06,249
that a family would struggle
at this time.

95
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,251
W-We're not struggling.

96
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:09,920
We're fine.

97
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:13,465
Mom. I thought it would be good
for everyone

98
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:16,635
to at least
acknowledge the date.

99
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:17,552
Yeah, OK. Yeah,

100
00:11:17,636 --> 00:11:19,471
I'm fine if you guy
s want to talk it out.

101
00:11:19,554 --> 00:11:22,682
Mary, I think
Jake set this up

102
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:26,603
because he feels that we,
you included,

103
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:30,899
should talk about
what happens next.

104
00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:33,944
Don't you feel the need
to draw a line, Mary?

105
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:38,698
To begin the process of closure?

106
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:40,617
On what?

107
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,744
Look, we're fine.

108
00:11:42,828 --> 00:11:46,706
I have the foundation.
I'm with my son every day.

109
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,583
I'm with my daughter, as well.

110
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:51,336
I mean, not... not in...
In reality,

111
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:54,297
but every day,
we work very hard to find her.

112
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:56,341
And other missing children.

113
00:11:56,425 --> 00:11:57,884
W-We help a lot of families.

114
00:11:57,968 --> 00:11:59,136
My wife...

115
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:02,889
Well, we don't...

116
00:12:02,973 --> 00:12:05,225
We're... We're... We're friends.

117
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:07,853
Yes. We're just not together.

118
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:12,315
We're compassionately
de-married.

119
00:12:14,693 --> 00:12:16,194
Right, yes.

120
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:20,031
And I just...
I guess I keep hoping

121
00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:22,075
that we will
reach a point where...

122
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,955
we can grieve together.

123
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:28,457
Maybe...

124
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:32,252
put a bench somewhere
that means something to us,

125
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:34,379
a place that we could all go
as a family

126
00:12:34,463 --> 00:12:37,924
and just remember our daughter.

127
00:12:38,008 --> 00:12:40,844
We don't need a bench, Saul.
Theresa's not dead.

128
00:12:42,179 --> 00:12:47,851
Mary. Do you have certainty,
or do you need certainty?

129
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:49,352
I have instinct.

130
00:12:50,854 --> 00:12:53,565
A mother's sense of her child,

131
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:55,233
and my daughter
is still out there.

132
00:12:55,317 --> 00:12:57,861
- I know it.
- How?

133
00:12:57,944 --> 00:13:01,448
Because I don't feel she's gone.

134
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:03,950
Always said
you needed therapy, Mom.

135
00:13:04,034 --> 00:13:05,869
Took this to get you here.

136
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:12,334
Mary, do you understand
Saul's need to mourn?

137
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:19,299
- Yeah. I do.
- Good.

138
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:22,093
I guess I've just always
been the optimist

139
00:13:22,219 --> 00:13:23,345
in the marriage.

140
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:10,850
Now you're gonna
see me cry.

141
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:15,730
I love that you're in touch
with your emotions.

142
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:18,692
Yeah. So in touch.

143
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:20,860
I literally feel
everybody's pain.

144
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,657
Except for mine,

145
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:28,743
'cause I don't have any pain.

146
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:31,913
Not anymore.

147
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:39,296
I have you.

148
00:14:41,298 --> 00:14:42,757
All of you.

149
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:13,371
I see the things I did
as acts of compassion.

150
00:15:13,455 --> 00:15:17,459
Young women trapped in ideals
put upon them...

151
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:19,711
Perfect girls
from perfect homes

152
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:22,255
when we all know
nobody's perfect.

153
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:24,549
You killed nine women,
Mr. Parker.

154
00:15:24,633 --> 00:15:26,801
You shattered the bones
in their hands and feet

155
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:28,553
so they couldn't
defend themselves,

156
00:15:28,637 --> 00:15:31,097
and then you beat them to death
with your hammer.

157
00:15:31,181 --> 00:15:33,642
If you need a monster,
I'll be your monster.

158
00:15:33,725 --> 00:15:35,727
But the truth is...

159
00:15:37,062 --> 00:15:39,856
those girls were begging
for their freedom.

160
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,275
Mom, stop listening
to that shit.

161
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:45,820
This shit is how
I'm gonna nail Parker.

162
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:48,448
It's how I'm gonna find Theresa.

163
00:15:50,033 --> 00:15:53,453
Well, I don't want you going
by yourself.

164
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:56,331
It's a maximum-security prison,
Mom.

165
00:15:57,332 --> 00:15:58,667
I'm gonna come with you.

166
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,753
After four years,
he's finally agreed to see you?

167
00:16:01,836 --> 00:16:03,588
I want to know why.

168
00:16:03,672 --> 00:16:05,590
Let Parker sit down with you

169
00:16:05,674 --> 00:16:07,842
after he already took
my other kid?

170
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:12,097
Never gonna happen.

171
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:05,942
Hi.

172
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:10,280
Your hair is so pretty.

173
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:13,658
Get up.

174
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:17,370
Just leave me be.

175
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:20,832
Get up, bitch.

176
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:41,352
Please.

177
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:53,364
You're a dirty,
filthy liar

178
00:17:53,448 --> 00:17:56,659
who lives in a house full of
slutty trash who no one wants,

179
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:58,745
that are so dirty and disgusting

180
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:02,123
that your own moms and daddies
didn't even want you.

181
00:18:02,207 --> 00:18:04,709
You know, bad things happen
to little girl liars.

182
00:18:04,793 --> 00:18:06,544
My mom did want me.

183
00:18:06,628 --> 00:18:09,005
Oh, honey, nobody wants you.

184
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,340
Nobody.

185
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:12,884
I mean,
except for the trashy boys.

186
00:18:14,177 --> 00:18:16,221
What are you doing?

187
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:18,681
Smile, bitch,
this is going on the Internet.

188
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:20,600
Stop! Please,
don't put that in my hair!

189
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:22,811
Just stop!

190
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:32,278
Oh, do... do you want to be
on her story?

191
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:39,452
Get out!

192
00:18:39,536 --> 00:18:41,454
Get out of here,
you little bitches.

193
00:19:05,562 --> 00:19:08,565
Don't show it...
That you're afraid.

194
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:11,818
I see it. They see it, too.

195
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:14,195
It's dangerous to be afraid.

196
00:19:26,207 --> 00:19:28,251
You're not from here,
are you?

197
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:29,586
You following me?

198
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,882
Why'd you help me?
You don't even know me.

199
00:19:35,717 --> 00:19:37,010
I know girls like that.

200
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:41,014
My mama died.

201
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:42,765
She had a heart attack.

202
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:45,435
That's why I don't have her
looking out for me.

203
00:19:47,729 --> 00:19:49,647
It's late. You should get home.

204
00:19:49,731 --> 00:19:51,482
I don't have a home.

205
00:19:51,566 --> 00:19:53,443
Not a real one.

206
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:57,030
I'm in a group home
for foster kids.

207
00:19:58,072 --> 00:19:59,574
Yeah, me, too.

208
00:19:59,657 --> 00:20:01,659
When I was your age.

209
00:20:01,743 --> 00:20:04,746
When you get out,
it gets better.

210
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:07,290
I went to live with someone...

211
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:09,334
kind, someone good.

212
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:13,379
- No one's gonna come for us.
- You don't know that.

213
00:20:13,463 --> 00:20:15,423
Well, you don't know this place.

214
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:18,009
There's stuff there... bad stuff.

215
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:20,595
We don't matter.

216
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:22,388
If things happen to us...

217
00:20:24,182 --> 00:20:26,392
it doesn't matter, either.

218
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:30,855
I got to... I got to get home.

219
00:20:30,939 --> 00:20:32,732
Stay away from those girls.

220
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,902
I don't know why
anyone would come here.

221
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:38,237
This place is rotten.

222
00:20:38,321 --> 00:20:40,073
I wanted a fresh start.

223
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:42,450
You shouldn't have picked
Saint James.

224
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:45,286
Yeah, well, I'm here,
and now I'm going home to sleep.

225
00:20:47,664 --> 00:20:48,831
I'm Jess.

226
00:20:52,627 --> 00:20:53,878
You got a name?

227
00:20:55,088 --> 00:20:56,088
Emma.

228
00:20:58,174 --> 00:20:59,175
Hall.

229
00:21:01,135 --> 00:21:03,471
No one ever stood by me
like that, Emma Hall.

230
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,975
Shame on them.

231
00:21:58,609 --> 00:22:00,111
Hi.

232
00:22:01,571 --> 00:22:03,114
Oh.

233
00:22:04,449 --> 00:22:06,492
Hi, little one.

234
00:22:06,576 --> 00:22:09,287
Hey.

235
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:11,289
How'd you get out here?

236
00:22:12,373 --> 00:22:13,875
I got you.

237
00:22:40,443 --> 00:22:41,652
OK.

238
00:23:26,656 --> 00:23:28,407
I'm sorry.

239
00:23:28,491 --> 00:23:31,035
These are the last words
I'll ever say to you.

240
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:33,412
I thought about
never saying them.

241
00:23:34,497 --> 00:23:37,333
I thought about trying
to erase you from my life.

242
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,627
But I can't.

243
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:45,716
So I have to write them down,
make myself end what was ours,

244
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,927
because I have to start again.

245
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:49,887
I have to forget you.

246
00:23:49,971 --> 00:23:53,057
I still don't know
how I'll do that,

247
00:23:53,141 --> 00:23:56,936
but I have to live without you,
and you without me,

248
00:23:57,019 --> 00:23:59,230
and we both have to
let each other go.

249
00:23:59,313 --> 00:24:02,733
We both have to leave
the darkness we were in,

250
00:24:02,817 --> 00:24:06,571
even if being without you feels
like the stars have gone out.

251
00:24:51,908 --> 00:24:54,076
So, Emma Hall.

252
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,786
Hmm.

253
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:58,414
I was in Seattle. I-I cut
in some really good places.

254
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:02,376
Oh, that's a place I'd like
to go to someday.

255
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:04,837
Don't let us keep you, Thomas.

256
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,967
You did notice this is
Saint James, Louisiana, right?

257
00:25:10,051 --> 00:25:11,761
I wanted to start over.

258
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:14,138
Only two reasons
anyone starts over...

259
00:25:14,222 --> 00:25:15,848
A breakup or a breakdown.

260
00:25:15,932 --> 00:25:17,600
I'm really good on details.
I work hard.

261
00:25:17,683 --> 00:25:20,102
I-I can cut and I can sweep
the floor, I can make coffee.

262
00:25:20,186 --> 00:25:21,675
If you need me to step up
because of the baby,

263
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:22,521
then I can do that, too.

264
00:25:22,605 --> 00:25:23,886
You gonna save the world
while you're at it?

265
00:25:23,898 --> 00:25:26,484
Yeah, maybe on the weekends.

266
00:25:31,948 --> 00:25:33,908
I'm really good at cutting.

267
00:25:33,991 --> 00:25:35,534
I want to rent that chair.

268
00:25:35,618 --> 00:25:37,286
It is a good chair.

269
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:39,288
I need to stay busy.

270
00:25:40,748 --> 00:25:42,875
You got some money for my chair?

271
00:25:42,959 --> 00:25:45,670
So... So no one else
can turn my head.

272
00:25:48,214 --> 00:25:50,716
Thank you for taking
this meeting.

273
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,636
I'm hoping that John can be
a real big help to the Trust,

274
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:56,264
on a voluntary basis, of course.

275
00:25:57,765 --> 00:26:00,559
Um, and I wanted to say before
we start that I'm so sorry

276
00:26:00,685 --> 00:26:03,104
there's still no news about
your daughter, Mrs. Barlow.

277
00:26:06,482 --> 00:26:07,984
Prison was a real epiphany.

278
00:26:09,026 --> 00:26:11,237
When you're away
from everything you know

279
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,489
and there's nowhere else to go,

280
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:16,951
uh, no one else to blame,
you've got to look to yourself,

281
00:26:17,034 --> 00:26:19,453
and I was able to do that.

282
00:26:19,537 --> 00:26:22,248
To think about what I had done

283
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:24,542
and the lives
that I had impacted.

284
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:27,253
The women you raped.

285
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,633
Our organization
supports ex-offenders

286
00:26:32,717 --> 00:26:34,885
in their post-prison lives.

287
00:26:34,969 --> 00:26:37,179
John genuinely wants to change.

288
00:26:37,263 --> 00:26:39,807
He's been recommended
for early release.

289
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:42,685
He's been employed
at the Allfoods supermarket.

290
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:44,770
He recently received
a commendation.

291
00:26:44,854 --> 00:26:46,939
This is, uh,
for my display work.

292
00:26:47,023 --> 00:26:51,610
Uh, I-I can tell you things

293
00:26:51,694 --> 00:26:55,990
about how the world thinks it is
and how it really is.

294
00:26:56,073 --> 00:26:57,575
Safety is a dream.

295
00:26:57,658 --> 00:26:59,618
That makes sense.

296
00:26:59,702 --> 00:27:02,705
But because of
men like you, right?

297
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:08,544
I-I was every woman's
worst nightmare.

298
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:10,629
I was the boogeyman.

299
00:27:10,713 --> 00:27:12,715
I stalked my victims.

300
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:14,759
I was a predator.

301
00:27:14,842 --> 00:27:17,094
But now I am well.

302
00:27:17,178 --> 00:27:20,723
And... And you want to work here
with us?

303
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:24,477
I... No, volunteer.
There... There would be no cost.

304
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,936
Work, volunteer.

305
00:27:26,103 --> 00:27:30,024
Y-You want to do something
with us here?

306
00:27:30,107 --> 00:27:31,859
I can tell you everything

307
00:27:31,942 --> 00:27:35,738
about the gaps where
ladies think that they're safe.

308
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:37,948
I drove a cab,
I worked as a cleaner,

309
00:27:38,032 --> 00:27:39,909
I cut keys for women.

310
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:41,786
I was all over social media, I...

311
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:44,080
- Can I stop you?
- Yes, please.

312
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:45,873
I'm trying
to get my head around this.

313
00:27:45,956 --> 00:27:48,709
You are offering what?

314
00:27:48,793 --> 00:27:51,128
Awareness raising.

315
00:27:51,212 --> 00:27:53,255
Our foundation's about victims.

316
00:27:53,339 --> 00:27:55,091
We counsel, we offer support,

317
00:27:55,174 --> 00:27:56,550
we help find missing persons.

318
00:27:58,677 --> 00:27:59,677
We're not a fit for you.

319
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:02,973
Well, hold on now.

320
00:28:03,057 --> 00:28:05,393
Maybe there is something
you could do for me.

321
00:28:05,476 --> 00:28:07,686
Tell me,

322
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:10,064
why did you do
the things you did?

323
00:28:11,774 --> 00:28:14,276
Why did you choose
the women you chose?

324
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:17,488
I mean, what was it?
Why one and not another?

325
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:24,412
Um, I don't like to talk,
um, in that personal way.

326
00:28:24,495 --> 00:28:26,372
I want to talk about the gaps,

327
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:28,958
uh, you know, offer advice...

328
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:31,127
Ideas that you could put
into a pamphlet.

329
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:33,838
I'm not interested
in a general sense.

330
00:28:33,921 --> 00:28:35,131
I want to know...

331
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:39,301
what makes a woman your victim.

332
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:43,180
Do you know
why I started this trust?

333
00:28:44,306 --> 00:28:45,683
Your daughter went missing.

334
00:28:45,766 --> 00:28:46,851
No.

335
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:50,563
She was taken.

336
00:28:51,772 --> 00:28:53,816
Seven years ago.

337
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:57,736
Now, I know who did it,
but I can't prove that.

338
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:02,783
So this whole trust is for her

339
00:29:02,867 --> 00:29:05,077
and others like her,

340
00:29:05,161 --> 00:29:07,955
and we work so hard
to help families

341
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:10,666
whose lives have been...

342
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:13,377
destroyed by men like you.

343
00:29:13,461 --> 00:29:16,630
- Maybe we should wrap this up.
- So, I-I'm glad you've changed.

344
00:29:16,714 --> 00:29:19,717
I hope people can change,
but what I would like to know is

345
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:23,512
what was it about my daughter
made a man take her from me?

346
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:26,307
I'm looking for insight.

347
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:29,101
- Uh-huh.
- You can't give it?

348
00:29:29,185 --> 00:29:30,895
You won't give it?

349
00:29:30,978 --> 00:29:32,897
Good luck.

350
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,356
Be a good person.

351
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:38,986
But I can't have you here
with us.

352
00:29:40,654 --> 00:29:42,823
I mean,
you understand that, right?

353
00:29:42,907 --> 00:29:43,949
Don't you?

354
00:29:56,378 --> 00:29:58,047
How did you find me?

355
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:00,216
I followed you.

356
00:30:01,217 --> 00:30:02,676
When? The other night?

357
00:30:04,136 --> 00:30:05,179
Maybe.

358
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:07,104
You got trouble
with those girls again, or...?

359
00:30:07,181 --> 00:30:09,099
Mnh-mnh.

360
00:30:09,183 --> 00:30:10,893
Good.

361
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,104
I've got, um...

362
00:30:16,524 --> 00:30:18,275
I got things to do.

363
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:20,861
You want to do them together?

364
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:23,864
No.

365
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:26,951
I'm busy. I got... I got stuff.
I got a lot of stuff.

366
00:30:29,411 --> 00:30:31,205
I saw her in the window.

367
00:30:34,375 --> 00:30:36,377
She's Bella Sharp's kitten.

368
00:30:38,546 --> 00:30:40,464
You gonna tell Bella Sharp?

369
00:30:40,548 --> 00:30:42,341
Not if you hang with me.

370
00:30:57,523 --> 00:30:58,816
Do you believe in monsters?

371
00:31:00,901 --> 00:31:03,946
Abel says
there's a swamp monster...

372
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:07,908
10 foot tall, skin all scale
like an alligator.

373
00:31:07,992 --> 00:31:10,703
One red eye, one black.

374
00:31:10,786 --> 00:31:12,204
And you believe that?

375
00:31:13,956 --> 00:31:17,001
- Oh, my God!
- What?

376
00:31:17,084 --> 00:31:19,670
- We all believe in monsters.
- Come on!

377
00:31:19,753 --> 00:31:22,256
You're the one who told me
not to be afraid of anything.

378
00:31:24,133 --> 00:31:25,384
So easy. I'm not.

379
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:26,844
Yes, you are.

380
00:31:26,927 --> 00:31:28,095
Who's Abel?

381
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:35,185
I can't talk about Abel.

382
00:32:05,007 --> 00:32:06,800
I'd live here if I could.

383
00:32:09,553 --> 00:32:10,638
I'd never go back

384
00:32:10,721 --> 00:32:12,264
and they'd never know
where I've gone.

385
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:15,267
But you'll know
where to find me.

386
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:27,571
Come.

387
00:32:30,115 --> 00:32:31,325
Come.

388
00:32:39,208 --> 00:32:42,419
That's my pot of money
that never runs out.

389
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:47,966
And that's the giant
that walks behind me.

390
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:51,929
She's invisible,
but I couldn't draw invisible.

391
00:32:52,012 --> 00:32:54,306
She eats anyone who's mean.

392
00:32:55,432 --> 00:32:57,101
She's my swamp monster.

393
00:33:00,729 --> 00:33:02,398
You got dreams?

394
00:33:05,818 --> 00:33:07,444
Must be something you want.

395
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:12,950
To go back and be with someone
I don't have anymore.

396
00:33:16,829 --> 00:33:18,497
I'm happy you're here

397
00:33:19,915 --> 00:33:21,667
with me in Saint James.

398
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:27,214
Yeah, well, I don't think
I'm gonna be here much longer.

399
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:42,938
You're my true friend,
Emma Hall.

400
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:55,284
I can't give you nothing better.

401
00:34:07,463 --> 00:34:09,298
Thank you.

402
00:35:02,518 --> 00:35:05,646
Mrs. Barlow, I'm so sorry.

403
00:35:35,676 --> 00:35:36,969
You OK?

404
00:35:37,052 --> 00:35:39,471
Have you left here?

405
00:35:39,555 --> 00:35:41,390
Have you left the cabin?

406
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:43,183
You been listening to the radio?

407
00:35:43,267 --> 00:35:44,768
You've been online?

408
00:35:47,062 --> 00:35:49,106
Have you talked to anybody
from your past, Emma?

409
00:35:49,189 --> 00:35:50,774
Hmm?

410
00:35:52,818 --> 00:35:56,738
No. Sometimes I want to. No.

411
00:35:56,822 --> 00:35:59,032
So you don't know?

412
00:35:59,116 --> 00:36:01,201
What is it?

413
00:36:08,709 --> 00:36:10,127
Look.

414
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:13,338
Something very bad has happened,
and I need you to trust

415
00:36:13,422 --> 00:36:14,744
that we'll get
through this together.

416
00:36:14,756 --> 00:36:16,008
Do you trust me?

417
00:36:16,091 --> 00:36:18,260
You're scaring me.

418
00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:21,763
Christopher Parker's dead.

419
00:36:21,847 --> 00:36:24,391
He killed himself
yesterday in prison.

420
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:34,943
- No, he wouldn't do that.
- He did do it.

421
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:38,155
- I'm here for you.
- No!

422
00:36:38,238 --> 00:36:40,741
Emma!

423
00:37:06,016 --> 00:37:08,727
You can't leave here.
Do you understand?

424
00:37:11,271 --> 00:37:14,024
You're not safe.

425
00:37:14,107 --> 00:37:16,693
No!

426
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:25,953
Why do you
keep coming here?

427
00:37:26,036 --> 00:37:28,288
I work my nights here.

428
00:37:28,372 --> 00:37:30,290
Oh.

429
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,962
- Where is it?
- Where's what?

430
00:37:35,045 --> 00:37:38,590
Without that necklace,
you're not safe, child.

431
00:37:38,674 --> 00:37:41,969
That was a powerful stone.
It was your protection.

432
00:37:43,804 --> 00:37:46,765
I gave it to someone... a friend.

433
00:37:48,809 --> 00:37:51,687
What kind of friend
do you have here?

434
00:37:57,234 --> 00:37:59,277
You need to lie down now.

435
00:37:59,361 --> 00:38:01,780
You need to relax.

436
00:38:47,451 --> 00:38:52,873
Emma! Open up, please!
Emma, please! Emma!

437
00:38:57,210 --> 00:39:00,505
Emma, please!

438
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:07,596
You said you were my friend!

439
00:39:20,442 --> 00:39:23,153
Please!

440
00:39:47,928 --> 00:39:49,805
One second.

441
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:59,356
Mrs. Barlow, hello.

442
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:04,736
Can I come in, John?

443
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:07,697
Of course. Yeah. Come in.

444
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:11,618
Have you changed your mind?

445
00:40:27,259 --> 00:40:29,594
Do you think people
can really change, John?

446
00:40:29,678 --> 00:40:31,638
If you let them.

447
00:40:31,721 --> 00:40:34,474
I believe in
the cycle of rebirth.

448
00:40:36,351 --> 00:40:38,353
I'm not so sure.

449
00:40:40,772 --> 00:40:45,527
I think we can try,
but our natures are our natures.

450
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:49,322
I think we can have good days
where we try to be better,

451
00:40:49,406 --> 00:40:51,992
but they're just days.

452
00:40:52,075 --> 00:40:54,661
No, Mrs. Barlow,
I think if we know better,

453
00:40:54,744 --> 00:40:56,163
we do better.

454
00:40:56,246 --> 00:40:59,499
Every day,
I wake up and I think,

455
00:40:59,583 --> 00:41:01,793
"What can I do better
for the world?"

456
00:41:01,877 --> 00:41:03,628
I mean,
and at the end of the day,

457
00:41:03,712 --> 00:41:06,173
I think,
"Did I make my good mark?"

458
00:41:10,927 --> 00:41:12,888
I want to believe in you, John.

459
00:41:16,141 --> 00:41:18,685
I ca... I can't tell you how much
that means to me, to...

460
00:41:18,768 --> 00:41:22,814
F-for me to hear you say that,
Mrs. Barlow, because truly,

461
00:41:22,898 --> 00:41:25,442
you have been
such an inspiration to me.

462
00:41:29,863 --> 00:41:33,283
I want you
to do something for me.

463
00:41:33,366 --> 00:41:34,659
A job.

464
00:41:34,743 --> 00:41:36,870
If you like.

465
00:41:36,953 --> 00:41:40,123
I need you
to find someone for me.

466
00:41:40,207 --> 00:41:42,125
I don't know where she is.

467
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:45,170
I don't even know her name.

468
00:41:48,798 --> 00:41:50,592
But this is who she used to be.

469
00:41:50,675 --> 00:41:52,219
I don't do that.

470
00:41:52,302 --> 00:41:56,181
This is the monster
that took my daughter, Theresa.

471
00:41:58,642 --> 00:42:00,352
I know you have pain,
Mrs. Barlow...

472
00:42:00,435 --> 00:42:02,354
Don't talk about my pain.

473
00:42:02,437 --> 00:42:04,314
Help me.

474
00:42:04,397 --> 00:42:08,485
Help me find this terrible,
terrible woman

475
00:42:08,568 --> 00:42:11,071
before she destroys
someone else's life.

476
00:42:11,154 --> 00:42:12,822
Do something good, John.

477
00:42:12,906 --> 00:42:15,659
That doesn't sound like
a good thing, Mrs. Barlow.

478
00:42:15,742 --> 00:42:17,577
Well,
I'm not giving you a choice.

479
00:42:17,661 --> 00:42:19,746
I'm giving you a chance...

480
00:42:19,829 --> 00:42:23,833
The chance
that you wanted to prove to me,

481
00:42:23,917 --> 00:42:25,585
y-your inspiration,

482
00:42:25,669 --> 00:42:27,754
that you could live
a different life,

483
00:42:27,837 --> 00:42:29,422
you could be someone new.

484
00:42:29,506 --> 00:42:30,799
I want to do that, but not...

485
00:42:30,882 --> 00:42:32,384
I don't want to do that
in this way.

486
00:42:32,467 --> 00:42:34,552
I'm sorry. I'm feeling
very uneasy right now.

487
00:42:34,636 --> 00:42:35,929
My stomach...

488
00:42:36,012 --> 00:42:38,390
I-I-I'm beginning
to have pains already.

489
00:42:38,473 --> 00:42:39,683
You got Tylenol.

490
00:42:41,017 --> 00:42:43,561
Take a vacation. Go sick.

491
00:42:43,645 --> 00:42:45,605
Quit your job, I don't care.

492
00:42:45,689 --> 00:42:50,610
You have four weeks
to find this person.

493
00:42:50,694 --> 00:42:54,823
Otherwise, John,
I will make sure

494
00:42:54,906 --> 00:42:59,160
that everyone knows
exactly who you are.

495
00:42:59,244 --> 00:43:03,540
You are the man
that we all dread.

496
00:43:03,623 --> 00:43:05,709
Take it.

497
00:43:07,669 --> 00:43:09,087
Take it.

498
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:16,094
Good.

499
00:43:18,179 --> 00:43:19,681
Good boy.

500
00:43:34,237 --> 00:43:36,197
Love is a virtuous mind

501
00:43:36,281 --> 00:43:38,742
that creates only peace
and happiness,

502
00:43:38,825 --> 00:43:41,119
whereas attachment
is never virtuous

503
00:43:41,202 --> 00:43:43,538
and causes only pain
and problems.

504
00:43:45,457 --> 00:43:48,793
Swiftly ascending
the other shore,

505
00:43:48,877 --> 00:43:51,921
we find the city of tranquility.

506
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:00,722
Love is a virtuous mind

507
00:44:00,805 --> 00:44:03,850
that creates only peace
and happiness.

508
00:44:08,271 --> 00:44:10,023
Jess?

509
00:44:15,695 --> 00:44:16,946
Jess?

510
00:44:26,289 --> 00:44:28,750
Jess, I'm sorry.

511
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:30,377
I'm sorry.

512
00:44:34,172 --> 00:44:35,507
Jess.

513
00:44:37,634 --> 00:44:40,095
I am your friend, Jess.

514
00:44:43,098 --> 00:44:44,766
Jess!

515
00:44:47,936 --> 00:44:49,479
Jess?

516
00:44:54,317 --> 00:44:56,027
Jess?

517
00:45:06,830 --> 00:45:08,456
Jess!

518
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:10,792
Jess!

519
00:45:10,875 --> 00:45:15,755
Oh, no, Jess!

520
00:45:24,305 --> 00:45:28,393
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

521
00:45:37,026 --> 00:45:39,362
Oh, no!

522
00:45:41,531 --> 00:45:44,284
Oh, no!

523
00:46:30,538 --> 00:46:34,250
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

524
00:46:34,334 --> 00:46:37,795
Oh, my God. No, fuck!

525
00:47:05,323 --> 00:47:07,742
Please! No!

526
00:47:53,496 --> 00:47:56,082
Sorry, we're closed.

527
00:47:56,165 --> 00:47:58,084
I just want a little trim.

528
00:48:13,641 --> 00:48:15,685
And then I want to know
the best bar in this town

529
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:17,103
to go get trashed in.

530
00:48:17,186 --> 00:48:19,689
What's your name?

531
00:48:19,772 --> 00:48:21,441
Theresa.

532
00:48:55,058 --> 00:48:56,934
Tell me a story.

532
00:48:57,305 --> 00:49:57,725
