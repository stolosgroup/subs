00:00:05,154 --> 00:00:08,794
Welcome to a very special
season of The Amazing Race.

2
00:00:10,194 --> 00:00:11,674
Well, hello, everyone!

3
00:00:11,674 --> 00:00:13,394
My name is Tyler
Oakley. -Korey Kuhl.

4
00:00:13,394 --> 00:00:15,674
I'm Joslyn Davis.
-And I'm Erin Robinson.

5
00:00:15,674 --> 00:00:19,354
<i>These 11 teams connect with
millions of people every day.

00:00:22,354 --> 00:00:24,594
<i>What happens when you take

9
00:00:26,874 --> 00:00:28,834
This is how I hitchhike.

10
00:00:28,834 --> 00:00:30,314
Whoo!

11
00:00:30,314 --> 00:00:32,034
Amazing. -Amazing.

12
00:00:32,034 --> 00:00:35,144
<i>...to race each other
in the real world?

13
00:00:36,234 --> 00:00:37,874
<i>Time to find out!

14
00:00:37,874 --> 00:00:39,504
COLE: Mom!

15
00:00:40,594 --> 00:00:42,674
(PHONES RING)
<i>Our teams are at home</i>

16
00:00:42,674 --> 00:00:45,194
<i>and have no idea the race
is about to start now.

17
00:00:45,194 --> 00:00:47,194
Mom! BLAIR: Phil Keoghan!

18
00:00:47,194 --> 00:00:50,034
Oh, my God, wait. How do I
get it? -What do you want, Phil?

19
00:00:50,034 --> 00:00:53,714
PHIL: <i>You're about to embark
on the adventure of a lifetime.</i>

20
00:00:53,714 --> 00:00:58,474
In just 21 days, you'll visit
18 cities in 10 countries

21
00:00:58,474 --> 00:01:01,994
and travel more
than 27,000 miles.

22
00:01:01,994 --> 00:01:03,834
Oh. Oh! Oh!

23
00:01:03,834 --> 00:01:08,074
And I have your next
clue here in Mexico City

24
00:01:08,074 --> 00:01:10,674
at the Monument
of the Revolution.

25
00:01:10,674 --> 00:01:12,674
Monument of the Revolution.

26
00:01:12,674 --> 00:01:14,194
We're going to Mexico City!

27
00:01:14,194 --> 00:01:16,234
We couldn't even find our
way back home last night.

28
00:01:16,234 --> 00:01:19,514
When I say 'go', grab
your bags, run outside,

29
00:01:19,514 --> 00:01:23,624
make your way to the nearest airport
and then find me here in Mexico.

30
00:01:23,624 --> 00:01:25,514
Whoo!
(SCREAMS)

31
00:01:25,514 --> 00:01:26,794
Let's get things started.

32
00:01:26,794 --> 00:01:28,874
We're starting right
now! Oh, my God.

33
00:01:28,874 --> 00:01:30,474
The world is waiting for you.

34
00:01:30,474 --> 00:01:32,154
Oh, my God! Good luck.

35
00:01:32,154 --> 00:01:34,314
Travel safe!
-Travel safe.

36
00:01:34,314 --> 00:01:35,834
No way.
-Let's go, Phil.

37
00:01:35,834 --> 00:01:38,474
Oh, man!
-What the heck?

38
00:01:38,474 --> 00:01:40,234
Go!

39
00:01:40,234 --> 00:01:41,754
BOTH: Go!

40
00:01:41,754 --> 00:01:43,594
(LAUGHS)
Oh, my God.

41
00:01:43,594 --> 00:01:45,154
Alright, go! Oh, my God.

42
00:01:45,154 --> 00:01:47,074
Oh, my God!
-OK, grab this.

43
00:01:47,074 --> 00:01:48,714
(SQUEALS)

44
00:01:51,034 --> 00:01:52,754
Good luck, alright?

45
00:01:52,754 --> 00:01:55,554
(SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY)

46
00:01:55,554 --> 00:01:57,194
Alright, gotta go.
You tryin' to do that?

47
00:01:57,194 --> 00:01:58,674
Are you tryin' to do that?

48
00:01:58,674 --> 00:02:00,954
Oh, my God. -Wait,
Joslyn, you speak Spanish.

49
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,794
Si! Si! Vamonos.

50
00:02:02,794 --> 00:02:04,474
I'm not even crying.

51
00:02:04,474 --> 00:02:06,634
Bye. I love you. -Bye,
Mama. I love you, too.

52
00:02:06,634 --> 00:02:08,954
Let's go, baby!

53
00:02:08,954 --> 00:02:10,474
(SCREAMS INDISTINCTLY)

54
00:02:10,474 --> 00:02:11,944
Daddy! Daddy!

55
00:02:14,594 --> 00:02:16,224
Got my passport.
Alright, let's go.

56
00:02:16,224 --> 00:02:18,474
Mexico City. We're going.

57
00:02:19,834 --> 00:02:22,074
(ALL TALK OVER ONE ANOTHER)

58
00:02:23,314 --> 00:02:25,434
Oh, there's our cab,
right over there.

59
00:02:25,434 --> 00:02:26,834
Oh, my God!

60
00:02:26,834 --> 00:02:29,794
Going to Mexico! How
do we get to Mexico?

61
00:02:29,794 --> 00:02:31,194
Hi. We need to
get to the airport.

62
00:02:31,194 --> 00:02:32,954
TYLER: Hi.

63
00:02:33,954 --> 00:02:35,434
KOREY: Yeah.
Something like that.

64
00:02:35,434 --> 00:02:37,274
KURT: I'm in!

65
00:02:39,104 --> 00:02:40,714
Are you driving us to Mexico?

66
00:02:43,954 --> 00:02:46,594
We are headed to
Mexico City. -Whoo!

67
00:02:46,594 --> 00:02:50,274
To get that message from Phil, just
starting right now, it's so surreal.

68
00:02:50,274 --> 00:02:51,914
I can't believe this is
happening. -Oh, my God.

69
00:02:51,914 --> 00:02:53,034
Dream come true right now.

70
00:02:53,034 --> 00:02:55,994
We're racing from home.
Like, what's going on?

71
00:02:55,994 --> 00:02:58,074
Yeah, it's crazy.
This is definitely...

72
00:02:58,074 --> 00:02:59,674
You really threw us
for a loop on this one.

73
00:02:59,674 --> 00:03:02,874
Do you have the passports?
-Don't freak me out like that.

74
00:03:02,874 --> 00:03:05,754
Welcome...to... BOTH:
The Amazing Race.

75
00:03:05,754 --> 00:03:08,234
# Dah dah dah,
dah-dah-dah... #

76
00:03:08,234 --> 00:03:09,514
I just love that song.

77
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,074
-== [ www.OpenSubtitles.com ] ==-

78
00:04:00,794 --> 00:04:02,554
Thank you.

79
00:04:03,954 --> 00:04:06,594
Oh, you want my
autograph? MAN: Yes, sir!

80
00:04:06,594 --> 00:04:07,634
So cute.

81
00:04:07,634 --> 00:04:10,994
Tyler and I met in college
at Michigan State University.

82
00:04:10,994 --> 00:04:13,274
The day we met was actually the
day I made my YouTube channel.

83
00:04:13,274 --> 00:04:15,394
You all look
incredible. (LAUGHTER)

84
00:04:15,394 --> 00:04:17,714
We make videos online and
we have a podcast together.

85
00:04:17,714 --> 00:04:20,674
I think that people watch us
because they might not feel

86
00:04:20,674 --> 00:04:22,714
like they have somebody
that they can connect to.

87
00:04:22,714 --> 00:04:24,674
I didn't have somebody
like that growing up.

88
00:04:24,674 --> 00:04:27,114
Like, I may have had
gay characters on TV,

89
00:04:27,114 --> 00:04:29,864
but I couldn't go online and find
somebody just sharing themselves.

90
00:04:29,864 --> 00:04:31,234
Oh, my God.

91
00:04:31,234 --> 00:04:33,154
We're super fans
of The Amazing Race.

92
00:04:33,154 --> 00:04:36,514
We are 100% going to win. -You
can write the cheque right now.

93
00:04:36,514 --> 00:04:38,074
Yeah. -We'll take it.

94
00:04:39,834 --> 00:04:43,034
Monumento a la Revolucion.

95
00:04:43,034 --> 00:04:44,674
There you go, but you're
making it sound French.

96
00:04:44,674 --> 00:04:46,394
I know. Revolucion.

97
00:04:46,394 --> 00:04:48,074
(LAUGHS)

98
00:04:48,074 --> 00:04:51,274
Matt and I are in kind of
a high-stakes relationship

99
00:04:51,274 --> 00:04:54,074
because we don't only work
really closely together,

100
00:04:54,074 --> 00:04:57,354
but we have been engaged for
almost three and a half years.

101
00:04:57,354 --> 00:04:58,834
We have not set a
wedding date yet.

102
00:04:58,834 --> 00:05:00,754
Welcome to Dance
Tutorials Live -

103
00:05:00,754 --> 00:05:02,984
the best place online
to learn how to dance.

104
00:05:02,984 --> 00:05:06,304
I'm a choreographer,
a dancer and teacher

105
00:05:06,304 --> 00:05:09,714
and I also produce the largest
dance YouTube channel in the world.

106
00:05:09,714 --> 00:05:12,394
Yeah, I think that the
race is make or break.

107
00:05:12,394 --> 00:05:16,234
It can be a huge boost for us
in just trusting each other.

108
00:05:17,754 --> 00:05:21,034
I'm so excited. Oh, my gosh.

109
00:05:21,034 --> 00:05:22,984
Working out! Working out!

110
00:05:22,984 --> 00:05:27,194
Joslyn and I are internet hosts
and producers at Clevver Media.

111
00:05:27,194 --> 00:05:30,274
Clevver is the number one
entertainment news outlet on YouTube.

112
00:05:30,274 --> 00:05:32,274
Snap, snap, snap. Slay.

113
00:05:33,914 --> 00:05:35,394
You know I'm excited
to do the race with you.

114
00:05:35,394 --> 00:05:36,754
Yeah.

115
00:05:36,754 --> 00:05:39,914
Zach and I met almost
three years ago.

116
00:05:39,914 --> 00:05:42,234
Rachel was the first
girl that I ever kissed.

117
00:05:42,234 --> 00:05:44,794
We have been married
for almost 11 months.

118
00:05:45,834 --> 00:05:47,834
Whoo!

119
00:05:47,834 --> 00:05:49,674
I make Vine videos.

120
00:05:49,674 --> 00:05:52,714
In those six seconds, there'll
be a little bit of magic.

121
00:05:52,714 --> 00:05:55,554
I kept growing the channel
and now it's at a place

122
00:05:55,554 --> 00:05:59,114
where it's kind of thrown us for
a whirlwind for the last few years.

123
00:06:00,434 --> 00:06:04,434
We are incredibly excited.
Pumped. Take a deep breath.

124
00:06:04,434 --> 00:06:08,194
I'm an attorney and I'm
also an OBGYN by profession.

125
00:06:08,194 --> 00:06:09,514
Work that runway.

126
00:06:09,514 --> 00:06:12,394
It was hard on me when
Blair left at the age of 17

127
00:06:12,394 --> 00:06:14,154
to pursue her
career on YouTube.

128
00:06:14,154 --> 00:06:17,954
Mainly my videos are
make-up and hair tutorials.

129
00:06:17,954 --> 00:06:21,634
I can't believe what started
out as a hobby in my bedroom

130
00:06:21,634 --> 00:06:24,074
filming videos - not
like that, Daddy -

131
00:06:24,074 --> 00:06:26,594
was turning into this.

132
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:28,994
I am single for the
race and I am not afraid

133
00:06:28,994 --> 00:06:32,234
to use a little bit of Southern
charm to maybe try to help us.

134
00:06:32,234 --> 00:06:36,114
We bring age and maturity.
-And I bring the lipstick.

135
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:40,914
COLE: I'm kind of sad.

136
00:06:40,914 --> 00:06:43,354
You know, we're both big
family people so we...

137
00:06:44,914 --> 00:06:47,074
..we never leave.

138
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:51,114
My name is Cole Brant and
this is my mom. I'm her son.

139
00:06:51,114 --> 00:06:55,114
My career has been
being a mom of six kids.

140
00:06:55,114 --> 00:06:57,554
I do feel that
this race is a way

141
00:06:57,554 --> 00:07:00,034
that I can show my
family a different side.

142
00:07:00,034 --> 00:07:02,154
Mom, I'm going out.
-Is your room clean?

143
00:07:02,154 --> 00:07:03,514
She'll never notice.

144
00:07:03,514 --> 00:07:05,034
I really just
make funny videos.

145
00:07:05,034 --> 00:07:06,914
And if you look
through my Vine page,

146
00:07:06,914 --> 00:07:08,514
you'll see videos that I
make with my mom and dad.

147
00:07:08,514 --> 00:07:10,794
Pretty sure that my fans like my
parents more than they like me,

148
00:07:10,794 --> 00:07:12,754
so I've got to throw
them in there a lot.

149
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:18,074
It sounds like it's going to
be a lot of social media people.

150
00:07:18,074 --> 00:07:19,874
That's what I do for a living.

151
00:07:19,874 --> 00:07:21,834
I make videos on, you
know, frisbee trick shots.

152
00:07:21,834 --> 00:07:27,194
We met at the 2006 Ultimate Frisbee
season at the University of Florida.

153
00:07:27,194 --> 00:07:29,554
We ended up winning a national
championship together, so...

154
00:07:32,514 --> 00:07:33,794
Oh!

155
00:07:33,794 --> 00:07:35,234
My whole thing is
just trying to get

156
00:07:35,234 --> 00:07:36,714
people excited about
throwing the frisbee.

157
00:07:36,714 --> 00:07:37,874
It's been a real blast.

158
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:39,794
Being on the race, we're
definitely confident.

159
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:43,034
Brodie is the single one
on this trip. I am single.

160
00:07:43,034 --> 00:07:46,514
We deal with hot chicks all the
time 'cause we're frisbee guys.

161
00:07:46,514 --> 00:07:49,154
Brodie sometimes gets
distracted by certain things

162
00:07:49,154 --> 00:07:50,834
and so I just have
to keep him on course.

163
00:07:50,834 --> 00:07:53,314
This is gonna be the
time of our lives.

164
00:07:53,314 --> 00:07:55,314
I know. Can you believe
we're doing this?

165
00:07:55,314 --> 00:07:58,154
We have been dating for
the last three years.

166
00:07:58,154 --> 00:07:59,834
And working together.
-We also work together.

167
00:07:59,834 --> 00:08:02,314
And living together. -So we
spend a lot of time together.

168
00:08:02,314 --> 00:08:04,794
Ashley started her career
as a professional gamer.

169
00:08:04,794 --> 00:08:06,554
I knew who you were.
I was a big fan.

170
00:08:06,554 --> 00:08:08,994
I was one of the first
members on his website.

171
00:08:08,994 --> 00:08:12,274
We run an online video
channel all about video games

172
00:08:12,274 --> 00:08:13,794
called Rooster Teeth.

173
00:08:13,794 --> 00:08:15,914
Our first show that we
made, Red Versus Blue,

174
00:08:15,914 --> 00:08:18,074
is the longest running web series
in the history of the internet.

175
00:08:18,074 --> 00:08:20,794
Being a lifelong gamer, what we're
so excited about with the race

176
00:08:20,794 --> 00:08:23,314
is that it takes the whole world
and turns it into one giant game.

177
00:08:23,314 --> 00:08:24,674
We couldn't imagine
anything better.

178
00:08:27,154 --> 00:08:29,274
Horrible, Jessica. Terrible.

179
00:08:29,274 --> 00:08:31,714
Is it Cole and his mom? Yes!

180
00:08:33,754 --> 00:08:37,434
We knew you guys would
be here. Wakey, wakey!

181
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:41,194
We just ran into Cole and
Sheri and we love them.

182
00:08:41,194 --> 00:08:43,704
I knew who Cole was
from social media.

183
00:08:43,704 --> 00:08:45,474
You guys haven't eaten
at all or anything?

184
00:08:45,474 --> 00:08:47,514
No, we're starving. We're used
to it anyways. We're models.

185
00:08:50,114 --> 00:08:51,754
Instagram has
definitely helped us.

186
00:08:51,754 --> 00:08:53,994
It's something new that they're
integrating within modelling.

187
00:08:53,994 --> 00:08:55,914
Clients say, "If we
send you this swimsuit,

188
00:08:55,914 --> 00:08:57,554
"will you Instagram
a hot photo of it?"

189
00:08:57,554 --> 00:08:59,874
And the more followers you
have, the more money you get.

190
00:08:59,874 --> 00:09:03,514
We are absolutely planning on
using our looks if we need to.

191
00:09:03,514 --> 00:09:06,914
We only have what we brought
and I guess we're bringing it.

192
00:09:06,914 --> 00:09:10,584
I mean, to be woken up by
two models, it was usual.

193
00:09:10,584 --> 00:09:12,034
Cole is strong. -Yes.

194
00:09:12,034 --> 00:09:13,514
He's young, he's
smart. He's athletic.

195
00:09:13,514 --> 00:09:16,994
I believe in multiple girlfriends.
I believe in multiple wives.

196
00:09:16,994 --> 00:09:18,794
Are we cougars?

197
00:09:18,794 --> 00:09:20,514
Maybe.

198
00:09:20,514 --> 00:09:23,274
If we were in college,
we would go after Cole.

199
00:09:23,274 --> 00:09:26,634
I might knock on his
dorm. In college only.

200
00:09:29,914 --> 00:09:31,994
Oh, my God! It's
Tyler. (SCREAMS)

201
00:09:31,994 --> 00:09:35,034
Oh, my God! (SCREAMS)

202
00:09:35,034 --> 00:09:36,824
Wait, come love me.

203
00:09:36,824 --> 00:09:38,394
How are you?
-Hi, how are you?

204
00:09:38,394 --> 00:09:42,634
I've met Tyler Oakley before and
we have a lot of mutual friends.

205
00:09:42,634 --> 00:09:46,474
I love his videos
and I am a huge fan.

206
00:09:46,474 --> 00:09:47,944
Hi.

207
00:09:47,944 --> 00:09:48,994
Sure.

208
00:09:48,994 --> 00:09:51,514
Thank you so much. Of
course. Nice to meet you.

209
00:09:53,474 --> 00:09:56,154
Do you do YouTube or...?
She does. She did YouTube.

210
00:09:56,154 --> 00:09:58,704
Oh, what kind of videos?
Well, she did one viral video.

211
00:09:58,704 --> 00:10:00,994
There's this Southwest flight
attendant, like, it went viral.

212
00:10:00,994 --> 00:10:02,194
I've heard of that.

213
00:10:02,194 --> 00:10:05,584
Everybody gets their very own
teeny weeny yellow Southwest bikini.

214
00:10:05,584 --> 00:10:07,074
One size fits all.

215
00:10:07,074 --> 00:10:08,794
I'm a flight attendant
for Southwest Airlines.

216
00:10:08,794 --> 00:10:10,314
I've been flying
for about nine years.

217
00:10:10,314 --> 00:10:11,944
I just like to put
my own spin on it

218
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:15,394
and I just feel like people kind of
pay attention more when it's funny

219
00:10:15,394 --> 00:10:17,274
and it went viral

220
00:10:17,274 --> 00:10:20,074
and within a week, we had 10
million and now it's 22 million.

221
00:10:20,074 --> 00:10:24,354
I'm a single mom and we're both
pretty protective of each other.

222
00:10:24,354 --> 00:10:27,274
I may not agree with every date
she's ever had in this world.

223
00:10:27,274 --> 00:10:30,634
But she doesn't agree
with all my dates either.

224
00:10:30,634 --> 00:10:33,114
OK, so what do y'all
do on social media?

225
00:10:33,114 --> 00:10:34,584
We make Vines. -You do?

226
00:10:34,584 --> 00:10:36,074
So my brother thinks
he's Barack Obama.

227
00:10:36,074 --> 00:10:37,314
I'm running for president.

228
00:10:37,314 --> 00:10:39,154
It's class president,
dude. -Haters gonna hate.

229
00:10:39,154 --> 00:10:44,034
I don't think people would
actually assume that we are smart

230
00:10:44,034 --> 00:10:46,194
from just looking
at our videos.

231
00:10:46,194 --> 00:10:48,234
My mom went to
Harvard and made sure

232
00:10:48,234 --> 00:10:50,194
that we were set in
terms of academics.

233
00:10:50,194 --> 00:10:51,394
We were homeschooled.

234
00:10:51,394 --> 00:10:54,824
We want to appear not too smart, but
we are gonna win The Amazing Race.

235
00:10:55,994 --> 00:10:58,074
I can't believe I'm
meeting you right now.

236
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:01,674
ASHLEY: Burnie is very popular in
airports. He gets recognised a lot.

237
00:11:01,674 --> 00:11:05,514
You guys made it...like, helped
me through some rough times.

238
00:11:10,474 --> 00:11:13,634
We are the official pilots
for our flight to Mexico City.

239
00:11:13,634 --> 00:11:16,514
Come aboard Mexico City
with Britt and Jess.

240
00:11:18,914 --> 00:11:21,154
PHIL: <i>All teams are
now making their way</i>

241

247
00:11:52,834 --> 00:11:53,834
Si, signor.

248
00:11:57,834 --> 00:11:59,034
I want to go fast.

249
00:11:59,034 --> 00:12:01,674
If you're not first,
you're last. (GIGGLES)

All I know is it's
pitch black out.

251
00:12:03,354 --> 00:12:06,114
And we're driving super fast
down the road, but it's awesome.

252
00:12:06,114 --> 00:12:08,114
I love it. This is so
awesome. It's exhilarating.

253
00:12:08,114 --> 00:12:09,954

all about, baby!

Si. -Gosh, I'm
turned on right now.

256
00:12:17,794 --> 00:12:20,554
We are in Mexico
City... -Mexico City!

257
00:12:20,554 --> 00:12:23,874
Heading to the Monumento
a la Revolucion.

258
00:12:23,874 --> 00:12:26,314
It's one of my
favourite monumentoes.

259
00:12:26,314 --> 00:12:28,314
In Alabama, we don't
have taxis whatsoever.

260
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:29,514
We don't have taxis there.

261
00:12:29,514 --> 00:12:30,994
But, hey, that's
what makes it fun.

262
00:12:30,994 --> 00:12:34,634
Because we're in a car right now
and we don't know whose car we're in.

Be quick. Your
clue is right there.

271
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:56,554
First clue.

272

Detour.

273
00:13:02,474 --> 00:13:06,954
The mariachi, a part of the
essence of Mexico and its people.

or do they need to be
all the same colour?

615
00:30:41,962 --> 00:30:43,202
I wonder.

616
00:30:43,202 --> 00:30:44,842
I think they might.

617
00:30:44,842 --> 00:30:48,082
I think maybe we do all blue
or all white? What do you think?

618
00:30:49,442 --> 00:30:51,482
I think it's all
one colour. -OK.

619
00:30:51,482 --> 00:30:52,922
So when I saw the mask,

620
00:30:52,922 --> 00:30:55,642
it had to actually be one
colour or the other colour,

621
00:30:55,642 --> 00:30:58,122
then I realised that I
didn't have enough pieces.

622
00:30:58,122 --> 00:30:59,602
I'm heading back.

623
00:30:59,602 --> 00:31:01,602
OK, I've got more than I need.

624
00:31:01,602 --> 00:31:03,922
Here we go. OK.

625
00:31:03,922 --> 00:31:05,642
Gotta find the drums.

626
00:31:05,642 --> 00:31:07,242
Marty? -Yes.

627
00:31:07,242 --> 00:31:09,202
How are you? -Good.
You find any fragments?

628
00:31:09,202 --> 00:31:11,122
Yeah. -Are they all silver?

629
00:31:11,122 --> 00:31:13,762
Not all silver.
Should they be?

630
00:31:13,762 --> 00:31:17,082
13 fragments. I must
keep them with me.

631
00:31:19,282 --> 00:31:20,882
Follow the drums.

632
00:31:20,882 --> 00:31:23,562
13. I got them all.

633
00:31:25,562 --> 00:31:27,922
10, 11, 12, 13. OK.

634
00:31:27,922 --> 00:31:29,042
Where are the drums?

635
00:31:29,042 --> 00:31:30,682
Are the drums this
way, do you know?

636
00:31:30,682 --> 00:31:31,922
That's not it.

637
00:31:31,922 --> 00:31:34,642
I hear the drums. Oh, my
gosh. I pray I have enough.

638
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:37,362
We're stuck in caves
and there's no drums.

639
00:31:37,362 --> 00:31:40,122
Clue. Alright.

640
00:31:40,122 --> 00:31:41,562
Darius is doing it, right?

641
00:31:41,562 --> 00:31:42,762
Alright, Jess,
you're gonna do it.

642
00:31:42,762 --> 00:31:44,242
I think it's me. I'll do it.

643
00:31:44,242 --> 00:31:45,642
How do I get to the drums?

644
00:31:45,642 --> 00:31:47,722
I came out. Everybody
is going back in.

645
00:31:47,722 --> 00:31:49,762
I love you, Daddy.
You're doing great.

646
00:31:49,762 --> 00:31:53,162
He's kind of amazing
and I'm not gonna lie.

647
00:31:54,522 --> 00:31:56,242
Is that what this is?

648
00:31:57,442 --> 00:32:00,562
OK. Where are the drums?

649
00:32:05,642 --> 00:32:07,602
Blue's gonna be
on the bottom here.

650
00:32:09,202 --> 00:32:11,842
Man, I just am stuck
on this one piece.

651
00:32:11,842 --> 00:32:15,122
I feel like it needs
to go the other way.

652
00:32:15,122 --> 00:32:18,442
I got 13 white pieces but I
realised some of them are duplicates

653
00:32:18,442 --> 00:32:21,042
so I just decided to
start digging again,

654
00:32:21,042 --> 00:32:24,282
see if I could get more pieces from
another colour and just start over.

655
00:32:24,282 --> 00:32:25,442
Let's go back.

656
00:32:25,442 --> 00:32:27,002
Is it all one colour?

657
00:32:27,002 --> 00:32:28,722
I think it might
be all one colour.

658
00:32:28,722 --> 00:32:31,682
OK, I'm gonna go back and get more
pieces. I don't think I have enough.

659
00:32:31,682 --> 00:32:34,682
Maybe the drums are down here.

660
00:32:34,682 --> 00:32:36,602
Holy cow! They were
down here all along.

661
00:32:36,602 --> 00:32:38,562
I'm making big mistakes.

662
00:32:38,562 --> 00:32:41,882
I dropped some of my pieces and
I don't know how many I dropped.

663
00:32:41,882 --> 00:32:45,562
Alright. Where are the drums?

664
00:32:46,642 --> 00:32:50,162
There's nine. I'm looking
for a couple more pieces.

665
00:32:50,162 --> 00:32:52,162
Hey, where do you
think the drums are?

666
00:32:52,162 --> 00:32:54,122
I don't know. I'd tell
you but I don't know.

667
00:32:54,122 --> 00:32:55,802
Is it something in here?

668
00:32:55,802 --> 00:32:57,522
Come on, Jessica!

669
00:32:59,682 --> 00:33:03,242
Yeah, shovel, yeah.
That's why it's there.

670
00:33:04,522 --> 00:33:05,962
I need two more.

671
00:33:05,962 --> 00:33:08,482
Are you finding little
drums on the ground?

672
00:33:08,482 --> 00:33:10,802
Scott, do you know where
the drums are? -I don't.

673
00:33:10,802 --> 00:33:12,162
Do you think we
came up a wrong way?

674
00:33:12,162 --> 00:33:13,642
I do. -You do?

675
00:33:13,642 --> 00:33:16,662
Follow the drums. This
is getting desperate now.

676
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:25,860
I thought I had all the
white ones. I just...

677
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:29,260
For some reason, that
last one wasn't going in.

678
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:30,740
I'm going to try light blue.

679
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,620
I'm bleeding.
-You're bleeding?

680
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:34,260
Yeah. -Oh, my
goodness gracious.

681
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:35,340
That's hard.

682
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:36,380
I believe in you.
-Thank you.

683
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:38,340
You got this.
-One more.

684
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:41,620
Alright. Judge?

685
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:45,260
Yes. Yes!

686
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:47,020
Thank you so much. Thank you.

687
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:49,740
Whoo! -I got it.

688
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:51,260
Good job, babe.

689
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:54,100
"Make your way to
your first Pit Stop."

690
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:59,420
Mexico has more museums than
any other country in the world,

691
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:03,620
<i>and the Museo Soumaya is the
most visited in the country.

692
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:08,100
The last team to check in there
at the mat <i>may be eliminated.</i>

693
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:11,140
Alright, let's go. Good
luck, guys. -Good luck.

694
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:15,900
OK. I'm ready to present.

695
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,860
Thank you so much. Thank you.

696
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:23,460
Tyler finished before me but
I think we can catch up still.

697
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:25,340
There's a lot of teams
that are still doing it.

698
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:27,300
Are you done? -Yeah.

699
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,660
We're in second,
we're in second. -OK.

700
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:30,340
Bye, friends.

701
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:33,420
We can beat the dancers
'cause we're right behind them.

702
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:36,700
Yeah, numero uno. Whoo!

703
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:40,660
Where is Kurt?
Come on, Kurt.

704
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:46,340
(ALL SING AND LAUGH)

705
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:48,010
Oh, my God.

706
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:51,490
Shoot, shoot, shoot. Holy cow.

707
00:34:51,490 --> 00:34:53,940
What did I do to myself here?

708
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:56,380
My dad is still over there
looking for something.

709
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:57,860
13.

710
00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:01,300
He hasn't started building
anything. I'm so panicked.

711
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,490
I know I gotta go back in the
tunnel to get to the drums.

712
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:07,180
Yes.

713
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:08,700
I think I need to go back.

714
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,580
I think there's
a missing piece.

715
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:12,100
Dammit!

716
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:14,970
Thank you. Right.
Piece of cake.

717
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:16,820
This is ridiculous.

718
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:22,420
To work so hard this first leg
and to potentially come in first

719
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:23,660
would be like a
dream come true.

720
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:25,860
We could beat Matt and Dana.

721
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:28,700
They were literally probably only
three minutes in front of you.

722
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:30,740
DANA: Oh, my God. No, no, no.

723
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:32,300
Oh, my God, we
passed the dancers.

724
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:35,060
That was them. That
was the dancers.

725
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:37,100
So it's gonna be
a run. -Oh, my God.

726
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,490
We have to get
around that taxi, sir.

727
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:40,060
We have to pass.
We have to pass.

728
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:42,660
Numero uno! Numero uno! Whoo!

729
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:43,700
It's so close.

730
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,060
It's going to be a
footrace to the mat.

731
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,970
It's literally going to be
a footrace to the finish.

732
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,820
Literally right behind us.

733
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:51,660
Go! You see them?

734
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:53,260
Gracias.

735
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:59,620
Go, go, go! Go, go, go!

736
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:02,530
Whoo!
-Welcome to Mexico City.

737
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:05,970
Dana and Matt, I am pleased to tell
you, on the first leg of this race

738
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:07,740
you are team number one!

739
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:10,140
(BOTH CHEER)

740
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:14,530
Oh, my God! -Man, you
made us run for it.

741
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:18,010
Tyler and Korey, I'm pleased to
tell you, you are team number two.

742
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:19,260
Pretty good way to start.

743
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,940
Not a bad way to start.

744
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:24,180
Are we going to see some interesting
things with your hair on this race?

745
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,780
What's happening right
now? -Well, it's...

746
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:27,820
It looks fabulous.
-It's wind blown.

747
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:29,530
Don't come for me, Phil.

748
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:32,940
We've been fans of the
race for years and years.

749
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,380
We've loved the race.

750
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:37,460
And to hear Phil say to us
that we were team number one...

751
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:39,100
It's a dream come
true. It really is.

752
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:43,380
Alright, get on that mat.

753
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:46,140
Why don't you tell Kristina
what it is exactly you guys do?

754
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:49,460
What's your deal?
-We make short, magical videos.

755
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:52,180
We're not allowed to use magic
on the race, unfortunately.

756
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:53,940
Phil, could I take a
selfie? -Can we take a selfie?

757
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:01,740
OK, that fit. Is
this the judge?

758
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:03,740
Yes!

759
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,460
Alright, I think I got it.

760
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:09,860
Thank you.

761
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:12,740
I think I'm just
missing a piece.

762
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:14,260
Oh, my God.

763
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:18,100
Just, I don't know if
I have all the pieces.

764
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,700
Crap!

765
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:22,260
Cameron, you look
a little relieved.

766
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:23,860
Ended up being in
the back of the pack.

767
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:25,490
No, you're more towards
the front of the pack.

768
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:27,740
Feels really good.
-Top half. It feels good.

769
00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:30,900
(DRUMS BEAT)

00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:35,140
Trying to figure out
what I'm doing wrong here.

771
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:36,740
I think I'm done.

772
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:41,460
Thank you. Oh,
my God, Brittany.

773
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:43,700
I think I got it.
Oh, baby Jesus.

774
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,580
Oh, my gosh. Thank you.

775
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:48,660
It's depressing to see
teams leave like that.

776
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:51,970
Brodie and Kurt, you
are team number five.

777
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:53,340
Yeah!

778
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:54,860
Sound good?
-Great job, guys.

779
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:57,380
Burnie and Ashley, that would
make you team number six.

780
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,420
Is it just us two, mama?

781
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:04,220
That really sucks, doesn't it?
Weren't we the first ones down here?

782
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:05,490
Yes.

783
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:07,220
Erin won't give up
while she's down there.

784
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:09,460
Oh, I know my dad won't give up.
-She won't give up. She'll keep going.

785
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:11,180
None of our team-mates
would give up.

786
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:14,940
Do you want to take the penalty?
-How long is the penalty?

787
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:17,060
Four hours. -Oh, gosh.

788
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:19,940
Are the other teams
putting it together?

789
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:21,660
I think they're done.

790
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:25,340
I think we're the last ones.
-What do you think?

791
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:27,580
I don't know. I don't
know if we should.

792
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:28,970
Let's do it.

793
00:38:36,215 --> 00:38:37,455
Do you want to
take the penalty?

794
00:38:37,455 --> 00:38:39,135
Do you mind going
back and just looking

795
00:38:39,135 --> 00:38:40,535
and seeing if
anyone is doing it?

796
00:38:40,535 --> 00:38:42,765
If they aren't, then you and
I will do the penalty together?

797
00:38:42,765 --> 00:38:44,015
OK. -Want to do that?

798
00:38:44,015 --> 00:38:45,285
Let's do it. -OK.

799
00:38:45,285 --> 00:38:46,615
Alright, here we go.

800
00:38:49,175 --> 00:38:50,895
He's still here.

801
00:38:50,895 --> 00:38:52,935
People just ran in
so I'm good, I'm good.

802
00:38:55,415 --> 00:38:59,175
You want to pick a number?
-Yes, I'm going to go with seven.

803
00:38:59,175 --> 00:39:02,575
You are so correct.
Team number seven!

804
00:39:02,575 --> 00:39:05,735
And you are team
number eight! -Whoo!

805
00:39:08,415 --> 00:39:10,805
This cave is, like,
starting to get to me.

806
00:39:10,805 --> 00:39:12,415
You want to take the penalty?

807
00:39:12,415 --> 00:39:15,695
One more time and then if I
can't get this then I'm down.

808
00:39:15,695 --> 00:39:18,015
13 pieces have
to fit together.

809
00:39:18,015 --> 00:39:19,975
Um, did I just get this?

810
00:39:19,975 --> 00:39:22,175
Alright, I'm going
to go try this.

811
00:39:22,175 --> 00:39:23,575
Oh, I think you got it.

812
00:39:23,575 --> 00:39:25,175
It would be a
miracle from God.

813
00:39:25,175 --> 00:39:29,055
Oh, my gosh! Oh, I love you!

814
00:39:29,055 --> 00:39:30,495
Come on.

815
00:39:30,495 --> 00:39:32,655
Can I help you? Is
there anything I can do?

816
00:39:32,655 --> 00:39:35,615
No, you just need to
go, sweetie. I love you.

817
00:39:35,615 --> 00:39:37,255
Where'd all those
pieces come from?

818
00:39:37,255 --> 00:39:38,855
Just all from my box.

819
00:39:38,855 --> 00:39:41,935
I have everything of blue and
everything of white except for one.

820
00:39:41,935 --> 00:39:44,015
I've got to go back to my box.

821
00:39:44,015 --> 00:39:45,695
There's more in there.

822
00:39:45,695 --> 00:39:47,285
Good job, Erin!

823
00:39:47,285 --> 00:39:50,215
Thanks, guys! I
love your parents.

824
00:39:55,135 --> 00:39:57,255
I'm missing a blue.

825
00:39:57,255 --> 00:39:59,135
I'm cold and I'm starving.

826
00:39:59,135 --> 00:40:02,495
At least 40 minutes
wasted looking for pieces.

827
00:40:02,495 --> 00:40:05,095
Come on. Come on.

828
00:40:05,095 --> 00:40:06,495
Oh, my God.

829
00:40:10,015 --> 00:40:11,895
I found a blue piece.

830
00:40:11,895 --> 00:40:14,895
This is for Blair. She doesn't
need to go home 'cause of me.

831
00:40:14,895 --> 00:40:16,765
I do not want to lose this.

832
00:40:24,095 --> 00:40:26,535
Finally. -Shoot!

833
00:40:26,535 --> 00:40:27,935
Mom! Mom!

834
00:40:27,935 --> 00:40:31,215
I'm so sorry.
-Mom, it's OK. We're good.

835
00:40:31,215 --> 00:40:32,895
Hey, good luck!

836
00:40:34,055 --> 00:40:36,055
OK. Here is your clue.

837
00:40:36,055 --> 00:40:37,655
Here he is.

838
00:40:37,655 --> 00:40:39,015
Sorry about that.

839
00:40:39,015 --> 00:40:42,095
You did so good. The
last team just came out.

840
00:40:43,495 --> 00:40:45,535
Right now we're heading
to... -The Pit Stop.

841
00:40:45,535 --> 00:40:48,495
(SPEAKS SPANISH)

842
00:40:49,895 --> 00:40:51,415
This taxidriver is killing it.

843
00:40:51,415 --> 00:40:53,535
Maybe the girls got
in a slower taxi.

844
00:40:53,535 --> 00:40:54,765
You never know.

845
00:40:54,765 --> 00:40:58,095
We're not even driving the speed
limit, but not that we would know

846
00:40:58,095 --> 00:41:01,535
because our cab driver's
speedometer is broken.

847
00:41:01,535 --> 00:41:05,455
We can still win. I'm not ready
to give up. Especially for you.

848
00:41:05,455 --> 00:41:07,095
You know, anything can happen.

849
00:41:07,095 --> 00:41:09,575
We're driving like on
a vacation sightseeing.

850
00:41:09,575 --> 00:41:12,375
10 is just first with a zero.

851
00:41:12,375 --> 00:41:14,255
(LAUGHS) That's right.

852
00:41:16,255 --> 00:41:18,495
Phil! I see him. Yes,
to the right. Follow me.

853
00:41:18,495 --> 00:41:19,575
Alright.

854
00:41:19,575 --> 00:41:21,975
Sheri, you look absolutely
petrified right now.

855
00:41:21,975 --> 00:41:24,415
'Cause I hope the other
team didn't pass us.

856
00:41:24,415 --> 00:41:26,015
You're not 10th.

857
00:41:27,095 --> 00:41:28,495
You're 9th.
-Oh! -Oh, my God!

858
00:41:28,495 --> 00:41:30,175
Hey!

859
00:41:30,175 --> 00:41:33,055
We ended up passing
somebody. Oh! Oh!

860
00:41:33,055 --> 00:41:35,215
Oh, my gosh!
-Oh, my god!

861
00:41:35,215 --> 00:41:37,255
You're good.
-We're good?

862
00:41:37,255 --> 00:41:39,375
Erin and Joslyn, I'm
pleased to tell you

863
00:41:39,375 --> 00:41:40,735
you are still in the race.

864
00:41:40,735 --> 00:41:42,615
You don't have to go home.
You are team number 10.

865
00:41:42,615 --> 00:41:44,695
Are you serious?
-I'm serious, I'm serious.

866
00:41:44,695 --> 00:41:47,215
I love you!

867
00:41:47,215 --> 00:41:49,735
Come on, Daddy. You got this.

868
00:41:49,735 --> 00:41:52,215
Hola. Oh.

869
00:41:52,215 --> 00:41:54,935
Scott and Blair,
Scott and Blair.

870
00:41:54,935 --> 00:41:58,135
I'm very sorry to tell you that
you are the last team to arrive.

871
00:41:58,135 --> 00:41:59,535
OK.

872
00:41:59,535 --> 00:42:01,055
Well, guess what. -What?

873
00:42:01,055 --> 00:42:03,055
You're not eliminated! -Oh!

874
00:42:03,055 --> 00:42:04,615
Oh, my gosh,
that's impossible.

875
00:42:04,615 --> 00:42:10,375
You are still in the race.
This is a non-elimination leg.

876
00:42:10,375 --> 00:42:12,895
Did that feel good?
-I'm so proud of you. Yeah.

877
00:42:12,895 --> 00:42:14,935
You got another leg.
-Bring on that Speed Bump.

878
00:42:14,935 --> 00:42:17,415
You're so positive. -I'm just
happy this isn't the end.

879
00:42:17,415 --> 00:42:20,095
I just want to be able to
go more places with my dad

880
00:42:20,095 --> 00:42:22,655
and, you know, who
knows if we'll be able

881
00:42:22,655 --> 00:42:24,255
to do something
like this again.
