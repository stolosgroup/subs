1
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:04,461
You guys, look.

2
00:00:04,462 --> 00:00:05,660
He's just saying...

3
00:00:05,994 --> 00:00:07,689
- Duh.
- Barely a rat.

4
00:00:08,046 --> 00:00:09,680
- Can I pet him?
- No.

5
00:00:09,706 --> 00:00:11,774
- Come on.
- You ask me that every year.

6
00:00:11,808 --> 00:00:13,542
One of these days,
I'm gonna wear you down.

7
00:00:13,577 --> 00:00:15,566
Your poor husband.

8
00:00:15,566 --> 00:00:18,229
Actually, um, no, we, uh,

9
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:20,394
we got a divorce a few months ago.

10
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:21,528
Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that.

11
00:00:21,564 --> 00:00:22,831
Oh, no, it's totally fine,

12
00:00:22,865 --> 00:00:25,467
I'm in a healthy
relationship with my DVR.

13
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:28,603
Okay, this might be
a little bit out of left field,

14
00:00:28,637 --> 00:00:30,972
but, um, I know this
awesome steak house.

15
00:00:31,006 --> 00:00:33,541
Let me buy you dinner,
and then I can answer

16
00:00:33,576 --> 00:00:35,778
all of your groundhog-related questions?

17
00:00:37,046 --> 00:00:39,280
Um, oh, so, like,

18
00:00:39,315 --> 00:00:40,774
you and I, we would...

19
00:00:41,383 --> 00:00:43,516
we would go to the steak house and,

20
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:46,521
like, eat the steak or maybe,

21
00:00:46,555 --> 00:00:49,691
like, order some sides
or something like that?

22
00:00:49,725 --> 00:00:51,726
Yeah, yeah, something like that.

23
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,461
Oh, my God, this is so hard to watch.

24
00:00:53,496 --> 00:00:54,562
I know.

25
00:00:54,597 --> 00:00:55,997
So, the thing is, like,

26
00:00:56,031 --> 00:00:59,868
I just got out of a really
long-term relationship...

27
00:00:59,902 --> 00:01:01,135
Oww!

28
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:02,637
Watch it! Gary!

29
00:01:02,671 --> 00:01:04,072
Oww, he bit me.

30
00:01:04,106 --> 00:01:06,174
Oh, come on, come on,
little buddy, you okay?

31
00:01:06,208 --> 00:01:07,429
He's gonna be okay.

32
00:01:08,544 --> 00:01:10,751
Does that mean we go straight to summer?

33

<i>Synced and corrected by hawken45

00:01:16,218 --> 00:01:17,852
<i>Attention shoppers,</i>

35

<i>our groundhog meet and greet
has been cancelled.</i>

36
00:01:20,856 --> 00:01:22,924
But if you were coming here
to meet a rodent,

37
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:25,861
your day was probably
not gonna be amazing anyway.

38
00:01:26,529 --> 00:01:28,663
Ugh, I mean, that poor groundhog.

39
00:01:28,697 --> 00:01:30,064
Look, I just got flustered.

40
00:01:30,099 --> 00:01:33,001
I'm not used to being flirted with.

41
00:01:33,035 --> 00:01:35,603
Well, at least you're
getting back out there.

42
00:01:35,638 --> 00:01:37,272
Oh, yeah? You're greasing
up the old gears?

43
00:01:37,306 --> 00:01:38,241
Hitting the road again?

44
00:01:38,242 --> 00:01:40,848
Seeing if that rusty hull
is still seaworthy?

45
00:01:41,143 --> 00:01:42,677
What vehicle is this?

46
00:01:43,081 --> 00:01:45,513
No, I'm not ready to start dating.

47
00:01:45,548 --> 00:01:46,174
You sure?

48
00:01:46,175 --> 00:01:49,450
I have, like, five cousins
who are very single.

49
00:01:49,485 --> 00:01:50,952
Well, thank you, but no.

50
00:01:50,986 --> 00:01:52,787
I am taking this time to focus on me.

51
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:54,422
I bought a bunch of succulents,

52
00:01:54,456 --> 00:01:56,391
and also, I'm trying Sudoku.

53
00:01:56,425 --> 00:01:59,027
I feel like I missed that craze
the first time around.

54
00:01:59,061 --> 00:02:01,230
You are a very, very boring woman.

55
00:02:02,464 --> 00:02:04,098
- Okay.
- Okay, thank you.

56
00:02:04,133 --> 00:02:05,800
- Thanks for the Band-Aids.
- That's all right.

57
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:07,268
That's the embryo

58
00:02:07,303 --> 00:02:09,537
right before they implanted
it in Dina's uterus.

59
00:02:09,572 --> 00:02:10,401
Isn't it cute?

60
00:02:10,402 --> 00:02:12,040
Yeah, I suppose it's cute,

61
00:02:12,074 --> 00:02:14,642
as far as amoeba-looking things can be.

62
00:02:14,677 --> 00:02:16,945
Well, I know it's just
a bunch of cells now,

63
00:02:16,979 --> 00:02:18,913
but if everything goes well,

64
00:02:18,948 --> 00:02:20,715
that's my and Jerusha's baby.

65
00:02:20,749 --> 00:02:21,783
Look, I don't wanna freak you out,

66
00:02:21,817 --> 00:02:22,951
but are you sure it's yours?

67
00:02:22,985 --> 00:02:25,333
'Cause it kinda looks like Elias.

68
00:02:25,921 --> 00:02:28,790
To be fair, all babies look like Elias.

69
00:02:28,824 --> 00:02:30,925
Hey, I need you to sign
this accident report.

70
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,524
I'm gone for one morning,
and Amy spikes a groundhog.

71
00:02:33,525 --> 00:02:34,926
What are you doing here?

72
00:02:34,927 --> 00:02:37,825
The doctor said to spend
the rest of the day resting.

73
00:02:37,826 --> 00:02:39,558
I'm fine, I've never
missed a day of work before,

74
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:40,482
and I'm not about to start

75
00:02:40,483 --> 00:02:42,470
because I had a few
boba balls shot up my runway.

76
00:02:42,504 --> 00:02:43,771
The miracle of life.

77
00:02:43,806 --> 00:02:45,640
Okay, no, I am taking you home.

78
00:02:45,674 --> 00:02:46,808
Come on.

79
00:02:46,842 --> 00:02:48,279
I'm not leaving the store.

80
00:02:49,345 --> 00:02:50,612
This is dumb.

81
00:02:50,646 --> 00:02:52,113
If I wanna relax, I fly to Ohio.

82
00:02:52,147 --> 00:02:53,414
I don't just sit and do nothing.

83
00:02:53,449 --> 00:02:54,193
Dina, please,

84
00:02:54,194 --> 00:02:55,817
if this implantation fails,

85
00:02:55,851 --> 00:02:57,969
I don't have enough money to try again.

86
00:02:58,681 --> 00:03:01,422
Fine, but I want it on
the record that this is stupid.

87
00:03:01,457 --> 00:03:03,057
Noted, and thank you.

88
00:03:03,559 --> 00:03:04,759
All right.

89
00:03:04,793 --> 00:03:06,320
You know, you might be surprised.

90
00:03:06,321 --> 00:03:08,763
A little fresh air and quiet
might be just the thing

91
00:03:08,797 --> 00:03:11,983
to, you know, put a smile
back on your face.

92
00:03:12,368 --> 00:03:13,084
Enjoy.

93
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,974
I need you to give me that walkie.

94
00:03:20,009 --> 00:03:22,491
Excuse me. Jessica.

95
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,881
So, word on the street is

96
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:29,267
you are horny and looking for love.

97
00:03:29,752 --> 00:03:32,286
Uh, no, who said that?

98
00:03:32,321 --> 00:03:34,555
Let's just say a little dumb bird

99
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:37,125
and her gay friend bird told me.

100
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:39,293
Well, turns out
you have bad information.

101
00:03:39,328 --> 00:03:41,529
Shh, shh, look,
here's what we're gonna do.

102
00:03:41,563 --> 00:03:44,365
The second our shift ends,
we're going to my place,

103
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,800
we're getting in my water bed,

104
00:03:45,834 --> 00:03:47,301
and we're not leaving till we figure out

105
00:03:47,336 --> 00:03:49,337
this whole will they, won't they,

106
00:03:49,371 --> 00:03:51,873
Kermit and Miss Piggy thing
we got going on.

107
00:03:51,907 --> 00:03:54,075
Wait, sorry, am I Kermit or...

108
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:55,743
Yeah, 'cause you're
smart with skinny legs

109
00:03:55,778 --> 00:03:57,820
and I'm Miss Piggy because I'm a star.

110
00:03:58,148 --> 00:04:00,181
So, what do you think?

111
00:04:00,215 --> 00:04:01,883
I just think it might be weird

112
00:04:01,917 --> 00:04:04,752
to date someone I work with, so...

113
00:04:04,787 --> 00:04:08,156
Okay, fine, then screw it.

114
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:11,159
- I will quit right now.
- No.

115
00:04:11,193 --> 00:04:13,327
- I no longer work here.
- No, no.

116
00:04:13,796 --> 00:04:16,097
I need someone to cover for Dina today.

117
00:04:16,131 --> 00:04:16,931
Any volunteers?

118
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:18,833
- Well, I guess I could.
- Question.

119
00:04:18,867 --> 00:04:20,401
Is it possible to hook up an Xbox

120
00:04:20,436 --> 00:04:22,503
to the security monitors
in Dina's office?

121
00:04:22,538 --> 00:04:23,671
I suppose so, yeah.

122
00:04:23,706 --> 00:04:25,073
You know, Glenn,

123
00:04:25,107 --> 00:04:26,063
I've always had an
interest in management.

124
00:04:26,064 --> 00:04:28,009
- I'll cover for Dina.
- Great.

125
00:04:28,043 --> 00:04:29,777
Ooh, Glenn, if he's doing that,

126
00:04:29,812 --> 00:04:30,894
can I do the announcements?

127
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:32,880
Well, Garrett's assistant manager now,

128
00:04:32,915 --> 00:04:34,129
so it's up to him.

129
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:35,850
I once did a radio play in college.

130
00:04:35,884 --> 00:04:38,621
Okay, fine, just don't tell
me one more word about it.

131
00:04:39,388 --> 00:04:40,922
This is a good team.

132
00:04:42,725 --> 00:04:43,738
Come on.

133
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,627
Relax.

134
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:50,598
Relax, relax, relax, relax, relax.

135
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:52,574
Relax, damn it.

136
00:04:53,235 --> 00:04:54,120
Come on.

137
00:04:55,657 --> 00:04:56,496
Ugh.

138
00:04:59,441 --> 00:05:00,655
Nailed it.

139
00:05:02,411 --> 00:05:04,879
I... sorry, I mean,
I would help him myself,

140
00:05:04,913 --> 00:05:07,115
but he insisted on
speaking with a manager.

141
00:05:07,149 --> 00:05:09,817
Hi, I'm Amy, the floor manager.

142
00:05:09,852 --> 00:05:11,052
I'm Castor.

143
00:05:11,086 --> 00:05:12,516
You look really nice.

144
00:05:12,921 --> 00:05:15,566
Okay, how can I help you?

145
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:19,727
Uh, Castor mentioned
that he works in insurance,

146
00:05:19,762 --> 00:05:22,063
which is a very stable industry.

147
00:05:22,097 --> 00:05:23,765
I used to work in textiles,

148
00:05:23,799 --> 00:05:25,767
but insurance was a dream of mine,

149
00:05:25,801 --> 00:05:27,668
so now I work in insurance.

150
00:05:27,703 --> 00:05:28,779
He took the leap.

151
00:05:31,457 --> 00:05:33,808
I'm sorry, do you two know each other?

152
00:05:33,842 --> 00:05:35,143
- No.
- Mateo's my cousin.

153
00:05:35,177 --> 00:05:35,858
Hmm.

154
00:05:36,678 --> 00:05:38,472
Cousin, in, like, you know,

155
00:05:38,473 --> 00:05:39,921
all Filipinos are related...

156
00:05:39,948 --> 00:05:41,304
Our mothers are sisters.

157
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:42,862
Okay.

158
00:05:47,539 --> 00:05:50,621
- What is wrong with Castor?
- Uh, he's weird,

159
00:05:50,622 --> 00:05:52,088
I'm not attracted to him,

160
00:05:52,122 --> 00:05:53,790
and when you mentioned that
he "worked" in insurance,

161
00:05:53,824 --> 00:05:55,925
you could've mentioned
it was horse insurance.

162
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,460
There's a lot of money in that.

163
00:05:57,494 --> 00:05:58,795
Horses' lives are crazy.

164
00:05:58,829 --> 00:06:00,463
I can handle my own
love life, thank you.

165
00:06:00,497 --> 00:06:04,100
Are you sure, 'cause you are
taking forever to smash it out.

166
00:06:04,134 --> 00:06:05,068
Again,

167
00:06:05,102 --> 00:06:08,638
I am not ready to start
dating, and if I were,

168
00:06:08,672 --> 00:06:10,607
why is that the cousin
you set me up with?

169
00:06:10,641 --> 00:06:11,808
How about the one who always comes in

170
00:06:11,842 --> 00:06:13,076
to buy his protein powder?

171
00:06:13,844 --> 00:06:15,812
You think you can land Rogelio?

172
00:06:15,846 --> 00:06:17,146
Straight girl, please.

173
00:06:17,181 --> 00:06:19,082
Cheyenne, back me up here.

174
00:06:19,116 --> 00:06:20,930
I mean, I am way

175
00:06:20,931 --> 00:06:22,352
out of Castor's league, right?

176
00:06:22,386 --> 00:06:25,088
Oh, for... oh, you?

177
00:06:25,122 --> 00:06:26,459
Right now? I...

178
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:29,023
Castor seems good.

179
00:06:30,294 --> 00:06:32,362
Attention Cloud 9 shoppers.

180
00:06:32,396 --> 00:06:35,131
Sushi is on sale at the deli.

181
00:06:35,165 --> 00:06:38,720
Mmm, discount sushi
from a big box store.

182
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:42,138
Why just eat when you can
gamble at the same time?

183
00:06:43,055 --> 00:06:45,046
You know what, that sounded
harsher than what I meant it to.

184
00:06:45,047 --> 00:06:47,252
If you like the sushi,
just get the sushi.

185
00:06:47,549 --> 00:06:48,480
Are you okay?

186
00:06:48,481 --> 00:06:50,356
Yeah, I just, I'm trying
to do it like Garrett,

187
00:06:50,357 --> 00:06:52,619
but I'm a little better,
I think, feeding off someone,

188
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:54,195
you know, riffing in the moment.

189
00:06:54,196 --> 00:06:55,996
Yeah, sure, like a co-host,

190
00:06:56,273 --> 00:06:57,573
like, like, Kelly Ripa.

191
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:58,979
Yes, or Hoda.

192
00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:00,246
Okay, all right...

193
00:07:02,582 --> 00:07:03,632
Then let's riff.

194
00:07:03,633 --> 00:07:05,887
Oh, all right. You ready?

195
00:07:05,888 --> 00:07:06,435
Yeah.

196
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:13,592
Maybe we need to rehearse a little bit.

197
00:07:13,627 --> 00:07:14,548
Okay.

198
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,616
No, I am at work.

199
00:07:16,617 --> 00:07:19,827
I'm getting paid to sit around
and play video games all day.

200
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,729
Aww, sorry, Craig,
I forgot you got fired,

201
00:07:23,136 --> 00:07:25,271
Hey, Garrett,
can I leave a little early?

202
00:07:25,305 --> 00:07:27,306
I teach water aerobics
to seniors after work,

203
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:28,972
and they yell at me if I'm late.

204
00:07:29,309 --> 00:07:30,386
It can get racist.

205
00:07:30,589 --> 00:07:31,902
They don't know what I am,

206
00:07:31,903 --> 00:07:33,679
so it's kind of all over the place.

207
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,658
Kinda busy, I say you just do you.

208
00:07:36,149 --> 00:07:37,950
Really? Dina normally says that...

209
00:07:37,984 --> 00:07:39,654
Just do whatever you want.

210
00:07:42,301 --> 00:07:44,089
No, not you, Craig,
you need to go back to Staples

211
00:07:44,124 --> 00:07:45,429
and make things right.

212
00:07:45,825 --> 00:07:47,593
Amy, I'm gonna give you some

213
00:07:47,627 --> 00:07:48,895
gay man tough love right now.

214
00:07:48,896 --> 00:07:50,320
Okay? You ready?

215
00:07:50,931 --> 00:07:51,931
I wanna make sure you're ready.

216
00:07:51,965 --> 00:07:53,515
What, Mateo?

217
00:07:55,001 --> 00:07:56,477
Okay, no tea, no shade...

218
00:07:56,803 --> 00:07:58,619
you're not a ten right now.

219
00:07:58,838 --> 00:07:59,966
It's not about your looks.

220
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,840
You just have some major dings.

221
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:03,642
You're over 30, you're divorced,

222
00:08:03,677 --> 00:08:04,643
you have a kid.

223
00:08:04,678 --> 00:08:05,644
Cheyenne has a baby,

224
00:08:05,679 --> 00:08:06,719
does that give her a ding?

225
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,280
No, because I have a baby

226
00:08:08,315 --> 00:08:10,182
the way that Chrissy Teigen has a baby.

227
00:08:10,217 --> 00:08:11,476
You have an old baby,

228
00:08:11,477 --> 00:08:13,619
- so that's a double ding.
- Yeah.

229
00:08:13,653 --> 00:08:16,822
Plus, you're probably really
out of practice sex-wise.

230
00:08:16,856 --> 00:08:17,672
Excuse me?

231
00:08:17,673 --> 00:08:19,671
And I'm guessing your
downstairs is a jungle?

232
00:08:19,672 --> 00:08:20,960
Mm, retro.

233
00:08:20,994 --> 00:08:21,887
Nothing wrong with that.

234
00:08:21,888 --> 00:08:24,296
No, it is a manicu... you know what?

235
00:08:24,331 --> 00:08:25,869
I am not gonna defend myself.

236
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:29,001
This whole system
of rating people is gross.

237
00:08:29,035 --> 00:08:30,100
What's my number?

238
00:08:30,101 --> 00:08:32,938
Um, you're a four, Justine's a three.

239
00:08:32,973 --> 00:08:35,107
But it's cool, 'cause
I clean up on twos.

240
00:08:35,141 --> 00:08:36,542
Girl's trip!

241
00:08:36,576 --> 00:08:38,611
No, Sarah's a seven, Brett's an eight,

242
00:08:38,645 --> 00:08:41,146
Tate's a ten because
he has a good job and abs.

243
00:08:41,181 --> 00:08:43,048
That's correct, I'm
the complete package.

244
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:44,950
Wait, what number is Amy? Are we tied?

245
00:08:44,951 --> 00:08:46,227
God, no.

246
00:08:47,153 --> 00:08:48,854
I'm sorry, that was not...

247
00:08:48,888 --> 00:08:50,460
no, I think you're beautiful.

248
00:08:50,824 --> 00:08:52,625
See, this whole system
just sets us back.

249
00:08:52,659 --> 00:08:54,059
You're just a little bit
higher than Justine.

250
00:08:54,094 --> 00:08:55,563
A little higher?

251
00:08:56,062 --> 00:08:58,860
No offense, Justine,
we're all God's creatures.

252
00:08:58,891 --> 00:09:00,392
What?

253
00:09:00,435 --> 00:09:02,201
Attention Cloud 9 shoppers.

254
00:09:02,235 --> 00:09:05,838
Roma tomatoes are now $2.99 a pound.

255
00:09:05,872 --> 00:09:07,172
$2.99, Kelly...

256
00:09:07,207 --> 00:09:10,209
a small price to pay
for a taste of Italy.

257
00:09:10,243 --> 00:09:11,377
That's for sure.

258
00:09:11,411 --> 00:09:13,078
Now, Jonah, I always forget...

259
00:09:13,113 --> 00:09:15,714
are tomatoes a fruit
or are they a vegetable?

260
00:09:15,749 --> 00:09:17,483
<i>Oh, I say vegetables</i>

261
00:09:17,517 --> 00:09:19,585
<i>so I get credit for eating my veggies.</i>

262
00:09:19,619 --> 00:09:20,719
I know, right?

263
00:09:20,754 --> 00:09:22,521
Busted, okay, I'm busted.

264
00:09:27,527 --> 00:09:30,696
Well, someone's looking relaxed.

265
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:32,665
Huh? Oh, yeah.

266
00:09:32,699 --> 00:09:35,034
I've been staring at these
rocks for the past hour.

267
00:09:35,068 --> 00:09:36,339
If you soften your focus,

268
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,570
it kinda looks like
two bats making paella.

269
00:09:38,605 --> 00:09:40,572
Oh yeah, yeah.

270
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:42,074
Yeah, anyway, um,

271
00:09:42,108 --> 00:09:44,570
if you really wanna get
up, I guess it's okay,

272
00:09:44,571 --> 00:09:46,445
but you have to promise to take it easy.

273
00:09:46,479 --> 00:09:48,747
Actually, I'd like another
ten minutes if it's okay.

274
00:09:48,782 --> 00:09:51,250
A hummingbird flew by and
I wanna see if he comes back.

275
00:09:51,284 --> 00:09:53,382
Take all the time you need.

276
00:09:53,787 --> 00:09:55,087
Can I get you anything?

277
00:09:55,433 --> 00:09:56,955
- Really?
- Yeah.

278
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:58,757
I mean, I could use a snack...

279
00:09:58,792 --> 00:09:59,758
just some baby carrots.

280
00:09:59,793 --> 00:10:00,611
Okay.

281
00:10:00,612 --> 00:10:02,127
- And pita chips.
- Mm-hmm.

282
00:10:02,169 --> 00:10:03,253
Ooh, and dips...

283
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,769
hummus, vegan tzatziki, maybe a guac.

284
00:10:05,932 --> 00:10:07,232
Yeah, for sure a guac.

285
00:10:07,267 --> 00:10:08,951
And if you could stack them in a bowl...

286
00:10:08,952 --> 00:10:11,070
preferably glass
so I can see the layers...

287
00:10:11,104 --> 00:10:12,805
that'd be great, thanks.

288
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:14,273
Okay.

289
00:10:14,307 --> 00:10:15,941
I'll see what we have that wasn't

290
00:10:15,975 --> 00:10:17,594
part of the listeria outbreak.

291
00:10:19,079 --> 00:10:20,117
You think it fits?

292
00:10:20,447 --> 00:10:22,588
Yeah, I don't say this very often,

293
00:10:22,589 --> 00:10:24,750
but that Cloud 9 suit
looks really great on you.

294
00:10:24,784 --> 00:10:25,577
Oh, thanks.

295
00:10:27,153 --> 00:10:29,455
Hey, um, can I ask you a question?

296
00:10:29,489 --> 00:10:30,217
Yeah.

297
00:10:30,218 --> 00:10:33,953
Would you go out on a date
with someone like me?

298
00:10:33,954 --> 00:10:35,213
Oh, I'm married.

299
00:10:35,214 --> 00:10:36,895
Oh, no, no, no, I'm not asking you out.

300
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:38,630
I just mean, like, theoretically.

301
00:10:38,911 --> 00:10:40,966
Like, say your wife died
and you're single now.

302
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,468
What? Why would she have died?

303
00:10:42,502 --> 00:10:43,802
Okay fine, she never existed,

304
00:10:43,837 --> 00:10:44,710
or she was abducted.

305
00:10:44,711 --> 00:10:46,009
And you're not sad, you're fine.

306
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:47,172
You were looking for a way out,

307
00:10:47,207 --> 00:10:48,192
and it led you to me,

308
00:10:48,193 --> 00:10:50,342
so on a scale from one to ten,

309
00:10:50,377 --> 00:10:54,102
I'm like a eight minimum, right?

310
00:10:55,181 --> 00:10:57,149
Uh, yeah, um, you know what?

311
00:10:57,183 --> 00:10:59,818
I, uh, I have a lot
of great clothes at home,

312
00:10:59,853 --> 00:11:01,620
so I'll just...

313
00:11:01,654 --> 00:11:03,856
I'll just wear those
before I go out shopping.

314
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:04,752
Thank you.

315
00:11:04,753 --> 00:11:05,800
Okay.

316
00:11:07,394 --> 00:11:09,094
Garrett, what happened?

317
00:11:09,129 --> 00:11:11,497
Yeah, I don't know,
Sandra was on softlines.

318
00:11:11,531 --> 00:11:12,396
What...

319
00:11:12,397 --> 00:11:13,665
Oh, you know what?

320
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:16,699
She had to do something,
so I told her she could bounce.

321
00:11:17,404 --> 00:11:18,482
All right, I'll see you later.

322
00:11:18,483 --> 00:11:19,538
No, wh-wh-wh-wh-whoa.

323
00:11:19,572 --> 00:11:22,107
You can't go home
until this is cleaned up.

324
00:11:22,142 --> 00:11:22,908
Seriously?

325
00:11:22,909 --> 00:11:24,476
Well, it's gotta get done,

326
00:11:24,511 --> 00:11:26,574
Mr. Acting Assistant Manager.

327
00:11:27,981 --> 00:11:30,558
Oh, why are these pants moist?

328
00:11:31,017 --> 00:11:32,484
Oh yeah, that happens.

329
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:33,852
Ugh.

330
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:35,835
Hey, so, um,

331
00:11:35,836 --> 00:11:36,932
I know this might sound weird,

332
00:11:36,939 --> 00:11:38,765
but on a scale from one to ten...

333
00:11:38,766 --> 00:11:40,492
Sorry, hang on, one second.

334
00:11:40,527 --> 00:11:42,394
Hey, do you wanna run it once
before we get on the mic,

335
00:11:42,429 --> 00:11:45,397
or just kinda dive in and
use that opening night energy?

336
00:11:45,432 --> 00:11:46,698
Let's just go for it.

337
00:11:46,733 --> 00:11:48,367
That's what I thought.

338
00:11:48,401 --> 00:11:50,623
Sorry, what were you saying?

339
00:11:51,478 --> 00:11:52,511
Uh, you're busy.

340
00:11:52,939 --> 00:11:54,173
I'll come back later.

341
00:11:54,207 --> 00:11:57,009
Okay, what do you think?

342
00:12:03,917 --> 00:12:06,185
<i>♪ Swiss cheese is on sale now ♪</i>

343
00:12:06,219 --> 00:12:07,553
<i>♪ On sale now ♪</i>

344
00:12:07,587 --> 00:12:09,012
<i>♪ Better get it fast ♪</i>

345
00:12:09,013 --> 00:12:11,557
<i>♪ 'Cause it will sell o-out ♪</i>

346
00:12:11,591 --> 00:12:14,059
Ugh, maybe we should
allow bullying in schools

347
00:12:14,093 --> 00:12:15,604
if it'll prevent stuff like this.

348
00:12:15,605 --> 00:12:17,001
Yeah, tell me about it.

349
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:18,864
Tough day at the office?

350
00:12:18,898 --> 00:12:20,499
I'm just kidding,
you don't have an office.

351
00:12:20,533 --> 00:12:23,068
You know, it hasn't been great, Tate.

352
00:12:23,102 --> 00:12:24,891
I killed a groundhog... probably...

353
00:12:24,892 --> 00:12:26,538
and if it lives,
it'll never be the same.

354
00:12:26,573 --> 00:12:28,874
And I learned that
on a scale from one to ten,

355
00:12:28,908 --> 00:12:30,342
I am immensely unappealing.

356
00:12:30,376 --> 00:12:32,077
You can't listen
to what people here say.

357
00:12:32,111 --> 00:12:33,251
They're all idiots.

358
00:12:33,713 --> 00:12:35,280
Today, one of them asked me
whether he's supposed

359
00:12:35,315 --> 00:12:37,082
to eat the cotton
inside the pill bottle.

360
00:12:37,116 --> 00:12:38,555
- Elias?
- Elias, yeah.

361
00:12:39,834 --> 00:12:40,886
Look, I know everyone here

362
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,454
is trying to hook you up
with a bunch of randos,

363
00:12:42,489 --> 00:12:44,056
but you should hold out for a good one.

364
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:45,397
You deserve that.

365
00:12:48,127 --> 00:12:48,903
Well, that...

366
00:12:49,005 --> 00:12:50,729
that kinda sounds like a line,

367
00:12:50,763 --> 00:12:52,067
but, um, thank you.

368
00:12:52,465 --> 00:12:54,266
Well, listen, I don't know
if you feel like a drink,

369
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,885
but I know a great little spot.

370
00:12:56,302 --> 00:12:58,103
I told them that I'm a veteran,

371
00:12:58,137 --> 00:12:59,696
so I drink for half price.

372
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:05,544
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

373
00:13:05,578 --> 00:13:07,112
Okay, good to know. That's fine.

374
00:13:07,146 --> 00:13:09,281
Um, more drinks please.

375
00:13:09,315 --> 00:13:11,283
Mm, mm.

376
00:13:11,317 --> 00:13:13,285
- Just one second, okay.
- Sure, sure.

377
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,621
- Let's go.
- Okay.

Dina?

383
00:13:27,503 --> 00:13:28,870
Were you here all night?

384
00:13:29,324 --> 00:13:30,017
Hm?

385
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,108
Oh, yeah, I guess I fell asleep.

386
00:13:33,463 --> 00:13:35,677
Oh wow, I feel rested.

387
00:13:36,568 --> 00:13:38,147
You know, some of my birds
have night terrors,

388
00:13:38,148 --> 00:13:40,083
so it's usually hard
for me to get that deep REM.

389
00:13:40,117 --> 00:13:41,619
Well, ah, that's, that's great.

390
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,135
I'm glad you got some rest.

391
00:13:43,705 --> 00:13:45,499
Yeah, why don't you, uh, you know,

392
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,791
get changed and we'll get to work, huh?

393
00:13:47,825 --> 00:13:48,907
Yeah, okay.

394
00:13:48,908 --> 00:13:51,010
Hey, it's gonna be a big day.

395
00:13:51,011 --> 00:13:52,262
Quarterlies are due.

396
00:13:52,296 --> 00:13:54,631
Plus, we're doing
double coupons on catheters,

397
00:13:54,665 --> 00:13:56,066
and at least two retirement homes

398
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,600
are bussing in the oldies.

399
00:13:57,635 --> 00:13:59,498
Ooh, boy.

400
00:13:59,694 --> 00:14:01,361
- What?
- Oh, I...

401
00:14:01,505 --> 00:14:03,106
Just got this feeling like a marble

402
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:05,308
rolling around in my uterus, I mean,

403
00:14:05,351 --> 00:14:07,112
gosh, I wonder what that's about.

404
00:14:07,265 --> 00:14:08,498
Probably nothing.

405
00:14:08,744 --> 00:14:10,121
Anyway, up and at 'em.

406
00:14:10,123 --> 00:14:12,390
No, no, no, no, you stay on that couch!

407
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:13,983
That sweet little marble

408
00:14:14,018 --> 00:14:15,352
is the only thing that matters.

409
00:14:15,386 --> 00:14:17,754
Okay, I mean, I will continue to lay,

410
00:14:17,788 --> 00:14:18,940
but only if that's what you want.

411
00:14:18,942 --> 00:14:19,702
I do.

412
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:20,997
You relax.

413
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:23,827
Hey, would you mind grabbing me

414
00:14:23,861 --> 00:14:25,662
some wet wipes and a bottle of Febreze?

415
00:14:25,696 --> 00:14:28,465
I wanna take a little whore's
bath before the store opens.

416
00:14:32,203 --> 00:14:34,033
Well, hey there, brown hair.

417
00:14:34,472 --> 00:14:35,260
Hi.

418
00:14:35,431 --> 00:14:36,281
Hi.

419
00:14:37,188 --> 00:14:39,089
Okay, bye.

420
00:14:39,343 --> 00:14:42,612
Well, I woke up feeling
very satisfied this morning.

421
00:14:42,646 --> 00:14:44,614
Must've been the great
night I had last night.

422
00:14:44,648 --> 00:14:47,174
Cool, um, I threw up in my driveway.

423
00:14:47,175 --> 00:14:48,186
Oof.

424
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:49,285
So, um, Tate,

425
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,822
last night was fun and impulsive.

426
00:14:52,857 --> 00:14:54,524
- Mm-hmm.
- And expensive.

427
00:14:54,558 --> 00:14:56,467
Yeah, sorry I forgot my credit card.

428
00:14:57,061 --> 00:14:58,344
Yeah, uh,

429
00:14:58,729 --> 00:15:01,364
but I think it would be great
if we kept it between us.

430
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:02,562
You know how people around here

431
00:15:02,593 --> 00:15:05,128
talk and gossip,
and we don't want that, so...

432
00:15:05,366 --> 00:15:06,231
Understood.

433
00:15:06,234 --> 00:15:07,668
Your secret's safe with me.

434
00:15:08,038 --> 00:15:10,198
When I journal about this...
and I will...

435
00:15:10,786 --> 00:15:12,768
I will call you Consuela.

436
00:15:13,744 --> 00:15:14,508
Okay.

437
00:15:14,604 --> 00:15:17,032
Adios, Consuela.

438
00:15:20,885 --> 00:15:22,552
Protip... if you cup the mic,

439
00:15:22,586 --> 00:15:24,204
you get a nice voice-of-God effect.

440
00:15:24,205 --> 00:15:25,889
Oh, why don't you go out to Los Angeles

441
00:15:25,923 --> 00:15:27,390
and give Laura Dern some acting tips?

442
00:15:27,425 --> 00:15:29,325
- Always with Laura Dern.
- She's amazing.

443
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,095
Okay, I gotta go feed Dina's birds,

444
00:15:32,129 --> 00:15:33,930
so today's the same as yesterday.

445
00:15:33,964 --> 00:15:34,946
Garrett, you're AM,

446
00:15:34,947 --> 00:15:36,723
Jonah and Kelly,
you're on announcements.

447
00:15:36,724 --> 00:15:38,141
- Wait, no, I just...
- No. No.

448
00:15:38,142 --> 00:15:39,370
I don't have time to argue, okay?

449
00:15:39,371 --> 00:15:42,399
I gotta go Google how
to give insulin to a parrot.

450
00:15:45,754 --> 00:15:47,583
So, this is my cousin, Nestor.

451
00:15:47,611 --> 00:15:49,078
He is studying to be a receptionist,

452
00:15:49,113 --> 00:15:50,583
and he sleeps on the top bunk.

453
00:15:50,584 --> 00:15:51,647
Hard pass.

454
00:15:51,648 --> 00:15:54,017
Okay, you can't just wait
for the Rogelios of the world.

455
00:15:54,051 --> 00:15:55,185
You gotta lower the bar a little.

456
00:15:55,219 --> 00:15:56,886
Yeah, eventually you're gonna

457
00:15:56,921 --> 00:15:58,755
have to put yourself back out there.

458
00:15:59,145 --> 00:16:00,084
Okay,

459
00:16:00,658 --> 00:16:02,892
not that it's any of your business,

460
00:16:02,927 --> 00:16:05,059
but, um, last night,

461
00:16:05,569 --> 00:16:07,136
I did put myself out there.

462
00:16:07,398 --> 00:16:09,599
Wait, you hooked up? With who?

463
00:16:09,633 --> 00:16:11,018
Doesn't matter, all you need to know

464
00:16:11,019 --> 00:16:12,916
is that I can definitely
do better than Nestor.

465
00:16:12,917 --> 00:16:14,230
Was it a guy or a girl?

466
00:16:14,688 --> 00:16:16,322
- Guy.
- Does he work here?

467
00:16:16,474 --> 00:16:18,608
- Yes, but I really shouldn't...
- Does he wear a hat?

468
00:16:18,642 --> 00:16:21,113
Sometimes, I don't know.
We're not playing "Guess Who?"

469
00:16:21,145 --> 00:16:23,336
Was it Brett? 'Cause
I've been shipping you guys.

470
00:16:23,337 --> 00:16:24,025
No.

471
00:16:24,026 --> 00:16:26,107
Oh, my God, did you have
a three-way with Elias?

472
00:16:26,108 --> 00:16:28,218
What? These are your guesses?

473
00:16:28,252 --> 00:16:30,960
No, it was somebody better-looking,

474
00:16:30,961 --> 00:16:32,989
someone more on my level.

475
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:34,624
- Marcus.
- Cody.

476
00:16:34,658 --> 00:16:36,426
- Mary.
- Okay, it was Tate.

477
00:16:36,869 --> 00:16:38,328
- Tate?
- You bitch.

478
00:16:38,362 --> 00:16:40,163
Yeah, and it wasn't a big deal,

479
00:16:40,197 --> 00:16:42,298
and technically, he's a ten,

480
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:43,800
and he was totally into it.

481
00:16:43,834 --> 00:16:46,235
So, maybe do the math on that.

482
00:16:48,939 --> 00:16:50,395
So, hang on now,

483
00:16:50,396 --> 00:16:52,642
Sandra, you're from Hawaii,

484
00:16:52,676 --> 00:16:53,977
but you've never been to the beach?

485
00:16:54,011 --> 00:16:55,116
What?

486
00:16:55,117 --> 00:16:57,369
No, I am deathly afraid of the water.

487
00:16:57,370 --> 00:16:57,909
Uh!

488
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:59,231
Never even saw the ocean.

489
00:16:59,232 --> 00:17:01,054
Wow, that is too much.

490
00:17:01,055 --> 00:17:02,860
Now, are you afraid of all water,

491
00:17:02,861 --> 00:17:04,233
or just the ocean?

492
00:17:05,055 --> 00:17:07,700
I'd like to answer your
question with another question.

493
00:17:07,701 --> 00:17:09,183
Where do hermit crabs live?

494
00:17:09,184 --> 00:17:10,860
Get a load of her.

495
00:17:10,895 --> 00:17:12,161
Where don't they live?

496
00:17:12,196 --> 00:17:13,663
You know what I mean?

497
00:17:20,014 --> 00:17:20,997
There she is.

498
00:17:22,072 --> 00:17:23,606
So, I was thinking that maybe we could

499
00:17:23,641 --> 00:17:25,675
head up the Delta Sky Lounge,

500
00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:28,344
drop some miles at the bar,
see where it goes.

501
00:17:28,379 --> 00:17:30,517
- Tate, I was thinking.
- Yeah?

502
00:17:30,518 --> 00:17:34,744
Maybe we should just keep
last night as a one-time thing.

503
00:17:35,553 --> 00:17:36,486
Oh.

504
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,655
It's just that, like,
I was in a weird place

505
00:17:38,689 --> 00:17:40,623
and I was sort of
feeling down on myself,

506
00:17:40,658 --> 00:17:42,025
and people even
in this store were saying,

507
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:43,226
like, I couldn't bag a ten.

508
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,197
Okay, so,

509
00:17:44,198 --> 00:17:45,517
I was just some kind of trophy

510
00:17:45,518 --> 00:17:46,996
for you to wave around to your friends?

511
00:17:47,031 --> 00:17:47,882
Is that it, huh?

512
00:17:47,883 --> 00:17:49,365
Another notch in your bedpost?

513
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,134
Shh, shh, no.

514
00:17:51,168 --> 00:17:53,702
Tate, can we please
just not make a scene?

515
00:17:53,703 --> 00:17:55,238
Well, well, well.

516
00:17:55,272 --> 00:17:57,574
- Look who banged the pharmacist.
- Yeah.

517
00:17:57,608 --> 00:17:59,900
I guess sometimes
Kermit goes home with Beaker.

518
00:18:02,023 --> 00:18:03,890
I thought you didn't
date people from work.

519
00:18:03,891 --> 00:18:06,096
I didn't, I don't, we're not dating.

520
00:18:06,167 --> 00:18:08,115
Oh, no, you made that abundantly clear.

521
00:18:08,116 --> 00:18:09,693
I guess I'm just a human vibrator,

522
00:18:09,693 --> 00:18:10,806
built for Amy's pleasure.

523
00:18:10,807 --> 00:18:13,530
Okay, um, could we just, you know,

524
00:18:13,564 --> 00:18:15,365
this is a very public space.

525
00:18:15,399 --> 00:18:17,000
May I remind you that I had dibs,

526
00:18:17,034 --> 00:18:20,003
so whatever you did with him,
you also have to do with me.

527
00:18:20,037 --> 00:18:21,271
Yep, that's what's fair.

528
00:18:21,305 --> 00:18:22,372
Um, that's not a thing.

529
00:18:22,406 --> 00:18:23,407
But you promised.

530
00:18:23,408 --> 00:18:25,208
Oh, so you're just
tossing that cat around,

531
00:18:25,242 --> 00:18:26,543
but Nestor can't get a turn.

532
00:18:26,577 --> 00:18:30,113
I'm not tossing anything around,

533
00:18:30,147 --> 00:18:33,616
and I don't want to be
dating anyone anywhere.

534
00:18:33,651 --> 00:18:34,851
Well, that's not
how it seemed yesterday.

535
00:18:34,892 --> 00:18:36,066
You were totally hitting on me.

536
00:18:36,067 --> 00:18:37,122
What are you doing here?

537
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:38,404
It's a store, I'm allowed to be here.

538
00:18:38,424 --> 00:18:39,348
Unbelievable.

539
00:18:39,473 --> 00:18:40,757
Someone's thirsty.

540
00:18:40,758 --> 00:18:41,773
Guys, enough.

541
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:43,249
Look, I had dibs,

542
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:47,530
so the order goes me,
beard guy, then Nestor,

543
00:18:47,565 --> 00:18:49,299
before we come
back around to Tate again.

544
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:50,667
What's going on?

545
00:18:50,701 --> 00:18:51,835
Amy hooked up with Tate,

546
00:18:51,869 --> 00:18:53,203
and then asked bearded guy out

547
00:18:53,237 --> 00:18:54,337
even though Marcus has dibs.

548
00:18:54,371 --> 00:18:55,371
Nestor's still in the mix,

549
00:18:55,406 --> 00:18:56,706
and that woman needs Tide,

550
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:58,341
but no one's helping her.

551
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:00,210
You hooked up with Tate?

552
00:19:00,235 --> 00:19:00,953
Um, I...

553
00:19:01,109 --> 00:19:04,814
I mean, wow, it's a big day for you.

554
00:19:04,849 --> 00:19:06,883
Maybe you need to take
a little break from dating

555
00:19:06,917 --> 00:19:07,861
and get tested.

556
00:19:07,862 --> 00:19:09,586
I can't take a break from dating

557
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,221
because I never started dating.

558
00:19:11,255 --> 00:19:14,023
Yeah, guys, she's just
banging out dudes right now.

559
00:19:14,058 --> 00:19:15,525
Bzz, bzz, bzz.

560
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:17,393
Human vibrator reporting for duty.

561
00:19:17,428 --> 00:19:19,062
Yeah, turn me on, use me up,

562
00:19:19,096 --> 00:19:20,338
and chuck me back in the drawer.

563
00:19:20,339 --> 00:19:21,481
I just want the Tide.

564
00:19:21,482 --> 00:19:23,733
Aisle 17. Stop ruining this.

565
00:19:23,767 --> 00:19:26,464
Yep, get back in there.

566
00:19:28,205 --> 00:19:30,540
Ohh, mama.

567
00:19:30,574 --> 00:19:32,342
I think I wanna call Jerusha

568
00:19:32,376 --> 00:19:33,743
and tell her what we're doing.

569
00:19:33,777 --> 00:19:35,811
Already called her. She's cool with it.

570
00:19:38,315 --> 00:19:39,638
There it is.

571
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:40,583
Yeah...

572
00:19:48,092 --> 00:19:49,008
Hey, Garrett.

573
00:19:49,332 --> 00:19:50,800
So, softlines is all good.

574
00:19:50,928 --> 00:19:52,228
Could I maybe take an early lunch?

575
00:19:52,263 --> 00:19:53,396
My cat's in the hospice.

576
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:54,797
No, if I let you leave early,

577
00:19:54,832 --> 00:19:56,099
then I have to take
somebody off register,

578
00:19:56,133 --> 00:19:57,011
to cover your section.

579
00:19:57,012 --> 00:19:59,536
Yeah, but this is my
last chance to say goodbye.

580
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:00,788
Shut up, Sandra!

581
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:04,134
I'm not...

582
00:20:05,307 --> 00:20:06,486
this is not...

583
00:20:08,312 --> 00:20:09,400
here, you take it.

584
00:20:09,747 --> 00:20:11,031
You be the assistant manager.

585
00:20:11,032 --> 00:20:11,590
What?

586
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:12,522
Just take it!

587
00:20:19,857 --> 00:20:21,457
Cloud 9's new bath towels

588
00:20:21,492 --> 00:20:24,127
are extra fluffy and made
from recycled other towels.

589
00:20:24,161 --> 00:20:25,428
And here to talk to us about them

590
00:20:25,462 --> 00:20:27,282
is famous actor, Al Pacino.

591
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:29,178
How's Hollywood, Al?

592
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,006
Oh, uh, these towels are great.

593
00:20:33,031 --> 00:20:33,968
Hoo-ah.

594
00:20:35,506 --> 00:20:36,739
Are you okay?

595
00:20:36,774 --> 00:20:38,474
Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm just,

596
00:20:38,516 --> 00:20:40,219
I'm not really feeling it, so...

597
00:20:40,417 --> 00:20:42,249
Oh, okay.

598
00:20:44,215 --> 00:20:45,949
If you like towels,

599
00:20:45,983 --> 00:20:46,783
then, uh,

600
00:20:46,817 --> 00:20:49,619
this is "The Godfather" of towels.

601
00:20:49,653 --> 00:20:52,488
You can use them to clean
up your "Scarface."

602
00:20:52,523 --> 00:20:54,690
That is not good.

603
00:20:55,826 --> 00:20:59,014
- These towels are 40% off.
- No...

604
00:20:59,015 --> 00:21:00,463
I mean...

605
00:21:00,497 --> 00:21:03,192
These towels are 40% off.

606
00:21:03,534 --> 00:21:05,668
And even if it's not a question,

607
00:21:05,703 --> 00:21:07,337
you gotta end up here.

608
00:21:07,371 --> 00:21:08,671
But then you're down,

609
00:21:08,706 --> 00:21:09,973
then you're down here.

610
00:21:10,007 --> 00:21:11,507
<i>Because when you were younger,</i>

611
00:21:11,542 --> 00:21:12,609
<i>when you were in "Serpico"...</i>

612
00:21:12,643 --> 00:21:13,876
<i>No...</i>

613
00:21:13,911 --> 00:21:17,513
Hoo-ah, I'm just getting warmed up.

614
00:21:17,548 --> 00:21:20,083
Al Pacino, everyone. He's back.
