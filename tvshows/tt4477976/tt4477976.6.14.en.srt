1
00:00:00,102 --> 00:00:04,262
<i>Okay, so I asked around,
and it's true.</i>

2
00:00:04,347 --> 00:00:05,527
<i>Zephra is shifting</i>

3
00:00:05,612 --> 00:00:08,777
<i>most of Cloud 9's
business online, so...</i>

4
00:00:08,964 --> 00:00:12,863
they're gonna
be closing some stores.

5
00:00:12,948 --> 00:00:14,739
<i>Some? Oh.</i>

6
00:00:14,933 --> 00:00:16,524
<i>Okay, well, I mean,
what's some?</i>

7
00:00:16,608 --> 00:00:18,874
<i>- Like, four?
- Three or four. Exactly.</i>

8
00:00:18,958 --> 00:00:20,702
<i>Well, that's not bad.
I like our chances.</i>

9
00:00:20,786 --> 00:00:21,833
No, it's bad, guys.

10
00:00:21,917 --> 00:00:23,835
They're closing
most of the stores.

11
00:00:23,919 --> 00:00:27,003
The number I heard was 95%.

12
00:00:27,113 --> 00:00:28,162
<i>What?</i>

13
00:00:28,246 --> 00:00:29,676
<i>So we're, like, screwed?</i>

14
00:00:29,761 --> 00:00:31,012
Maybe not.

15
00:00:31,097 --> 00:00:32,684
I'm gonna try to get
this store picked

16
00:00:32,769 --> 00:00:33,926
as one of the survivors.

17
00:00:34,011 --> 00:00:36,137
I'm still figuring out
what that process looks like,

18
00:00:36,222 --> 00:00:37,447
but, guys...

19
00:00:37,531 --> 00:00:39,362
we're not gonna go down
without a fight.

20
00:00:39,446 --> 00:00:41,368
Wait, aren't you
supposed to be the liaison

21
00:00:41,453 --> 00:00:42,583
to Cloud 9?

22
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:45,107
I mean, not a great sign
that they didn't clue you in.

23
00:00:45,191 --> 00:00:46,804
<i>I'm doing great, Dina.</i>

24
00:00:46,888 --> 00:00:48,197
<i>Some people invited me</i>

25
00:00:48,281 --> 00:00:50,025
<i>to a concert in the park
last week.</i>

26
00:00:50,109 --> 00:00:51,984
That's a free concert, Amy.
That's not an invite.

27
00:00:52,068 --> 00:00:53,811
That's like telling someone
where the bathroom is.

28
00:00:53,895 --> 00:00:55,755
You're really belly-flopping
out there, huh?

29
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,033
I am not belly-flopping.

30
00:00:59,314 --> 00:01:00,635

32
00:01:03,892 --> 00:01:06,085
Okay, everybody calm down.

33
00:01:06,169 --> 00:01:07,642
They're gonna keep
some stores open,

34
00:01:07,727 --> 00:01:09,252
and Amy's gonna do
everything she can

35
00:01:09,337 --> 00:01:10,350
to make sure we're one of them,

36
00:01:10,434 --> 00:01:12,439
so there's no need
to freak out about this.

37
00:01:12,523 --> 00:01:14,947
- That's easy for you to say.
- You make manager money.

38
00:01:15,032 --> 00:01:16,791
The rest of us,
we need this job.

39
00:01:16,962 --> 00:01:19,098
Mm-hmm. Well, except Carol.

40
00:01:19,182 --> 00:01:20,708
Oh, 'cause of my settlement?

41
00:01:20,792 --> 00:01:24,211
Hey, I still need this job
to keep me grounded.

42
00:01:25,144 --> 00:01:26,409
Seems to be working so far.

43
00:01:26,493 --> 00:01:28,629
Hey, okay, guys, come on.

44
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:30,892
Obviously, Jonah's
got some ideas.

45
00:01:30,976 --> 00:01:32,633
We haven't even let him talk.

46
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:34,200
Jonah?

47
00:01:34,284 --> 00:01:35,870
I mean, I'm not sure

48
00:01:35,955 --> 00:01:37,518
that there's anything
that we can do.

49
00:01:38,783 --> 00:01:40,511
I'm just trying
to be realistic.

50
00:01:40,596 --> 00:01:42,035
I mean, we've been
flattened by these guys

51
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:43,339
over and over.

52
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:44,994
I just...

53
00:01:45,078 --> 00:01:47,044
Yeah, I don't know what to say

54
00:01:48,778 --> 00:01:50,913
Uh, hey, I'm not sure
that's an idea

55
00:01:50,997 --> 00:01:53,046
so much as a downer,
so maybe next time

56
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:55,409
just don't stop the meeting
if you don't have anything.

57
00:01:55,494 --> 00:01:56,702
Yeah...

58
00:01:56,786 --> 00:01:58,312
my bad.

59
00:01:58,396 --> 00:01:59,966
<i>♪ A fake Jamaican</i>

60
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:03,274
<i>♪ Took every last dime
with a scam ♪</i>

61
00:02:04,934 --> 00:02:06,122
<i>♪ It was worth it</i>

62
00:02:06,207 --> 00:02:07,982

63
00:02:08,067 --> 00:02:09,148
Must be nice.

64
00:02:09,233 --> 00:02:10,750
Thinking about buying
the fancy vacuum cleaner

65
00:02:10,834 --> 00:02:11,859
with the ball thingy

66
00:02:11,944 --> 00:02:13,250
like it's just a regular
vacuum cleaner

67
00:02:13,334 --> 00:02:14,372
with no ball thingy.

68
00:02:14,456 --> 00:02:15,851
Yeah, and she bought
a Dustbuster yesterday.

69
00:02:15,935 --> 00:02:17,288
She's just rubbing it
in our faces.

70
00:02:17,372 --> 00:02:18,724
You guys are missing
the headline here.

71
00:02:18,808 --> 00:02:20,465
The store closing
could ruin my life.

72
00:02:20,549 --> 00:02:22,554
It's not really a Powerball
jackpot for any of us.

73
00:02:22,638 --> 00:02:23,555
Yeah, but you guys
are citizens.

74
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:24,817
You can get any job you want.

75
00:02:24,901 --> 00:02:26,601
I need to start thinking
of a backup plan.

76
00:02:26,685 --> 00:02:28,647
Tony's looking for someone
to feed his sharks.

77
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:30,562
The trick is you have to wiggle
the food in the water

78
00:02:30,646 --> 00:02:31,911
to make it look alive.

79
00:02:31,995 --> 00:02:34,087
Okay, so "food wiggler"
is the job to beat.

80
00:02:34,171 --> 00:02:36,132
Maybe we should just all
ask Carol for money.

81
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:39,440
I mean, I guess it's possible

82
00:02:39,524 --> 00:02:40,833
she might need
a personal assistant.

83
00:02:40,917 --> 00:02:42,313
Maybe.
You think she'd be cool

84
00:02:42,397 --> 00:02:43,618
with paying you cash
under the table?

85
00:02:43,702 --> 00:02:44,993
Of course; That's how

86
00:02:45,078 --> 00:02:46,491
all rich people
pay their immigrants.

87
00:02:46,575 --> 00:02:48,362
I bet Dianne Wiest
hasn't paid a payroll tax

88
00:02:48,446 --> 00:02:50,059
in her entire life.

89
00:02:50,143 --> 00:02:52,018
And I feel bad because
everybody's looking at me

90
00:02:52,102 --> 00:02:53,280
like, "What can we do?"

91
00:02:53,364 --> 00:02:54,368
Yeah, that's hard,

92
00:02:54,452 --> 00:02:55,326
'cause in this case,
what can you do?

93
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:57,328
- It's done.
- Yeah.

94
00:02:58,451 --> 00:02:59,507
I mean, you know,

95
00:02:59,592 --> 00:03:01,941
it's not done yet, you know.

96
00:03:02,025 --> 00:03:03,123
Really?

97
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:05,202
Well, I mean,
we don't have to jump to done.

98
00:03:05,287 --> 00:03:07,772
5% isn't a good chance,
but it's... it's a chance.

99
00:03:07,857 --> 00:03:10,036
You know, that's what?
The odds are what?

100
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,994
- 5%.
- 5... yes, 5%,

101
00:03:12,078 --> 00:03:13,953
and no, but seriously,
and we've got somebody

102
00:03:14,037 --> 00:03:16,695
from corporate on the inside
who's pushing for us.

103
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:18,305
Yeah, and that's
really great,

104
00:03:18,389 --> 00:03:20,899
but I don't know if pushing
matters to a big corporation.

105
00:03:20,984 --> 00:03:21,954
I mean, decisions like this

106
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:23,963
involve months of planning,
so...

107
00:03:24,047 --> 00:03:26,297
Yeah, but I...
But, I mean, you know,

108
00:03:26,382 --> 00:03:27,836
nothing's final yet.

109
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,837
Yeah, I guess.

110
00:03:28,921 --> 00:03:30,186
I mean,
we have to do something.

111
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:32,232
We're not just gonna...
We're just gonna give up?

112
00:03:33,361 --> 00:03:35,588
No, we're not, so...

113
00:03:39,671 --> 00:03:42,111
It's really... it's smelly
out here today, huh?

114
00:03:42,195 --> 00:03:43,852
That's your subject change?

115
00:03:43,936 --> 00:03:46,337
Yeah, well, you know,
you use what you have.

116
00:03:47,723 --> 00:03:50,032
Carol, congrats
on the settlement.

117
00:03:50,116 --> 00:03:51,643
Oh, thank you,

118
00:03:51,727 --> 00:03:53,340
but it was never
really about the money.

119
00:03:53,424 --> 00:03:55,429
It was about the attention.

120
00:03:55,513 --> 00:03:57,823
Either way, well-deserved.

121
00:03:57,907 --> 00:03:59,346
Hey, listen,
do you want a latte?

122
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:01,479
I accidentally put vanilla in it,
and then I thought,

123
00:04:01,563 --> 00:04:03,437
"That's how Carol likes it!"

124
00:04:03,521 --> 00:04:05,396
Wow, I can't believe
you remember that.

125
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:08,007
What can I say?
I'm very detail-orientated.

126
00:04:08,091 --> 00:04:09,878
Of course, now you can buy
all the lattes you want.

127
00:04:09,962 --> 00:04:11,924
You'll need 'em.
You'll be busy now.

128
00:04:12,008 --> 00:04:14,535
Social engagements,
travel planning...

129
00:04:14,619 --> 00:04:15,841
I guess that's why
wealthy people

130
00:04:15,925 --> 00:04:17,321
get personal assistants, huh?

131
00:04:17,405 --> 00:04:20,367
Oh, I don't know
if I need a personal assistant.

132
00:04:20,451 --> 00:04:23,065
I like to be hands-on
with everything in my life...

133
00:04:23,149 --> 00:04:24,197
especially the men.

134
00:04:24,281 --> 00:04:25,285
Am I right?

135
00:04:25,369 --> 00:04:27,940
You are right...

136
00:04:28,024 --> 00:04:29,463
and I love it.

137
00:04:31,114 --> 00:04:33,554
Look, Jeff, I'm really sorry
you're in a pickle,

138
00:04:33,638 --> 00:04:36,427
but I just... I can't buy
a Subaru right now.

139
00:04:36,511 --> 00:04:39,430
Uh, the reason I'm calling,
that little flood incident,

140
00:04:39,514 --> 00:04:41,040
how much did you report
to corporate?

141
00:04:41,124 --> 00:04:42,302
And did they ever...

142
00:04:44,606 --> 00:04:47,699
Uh, I'm gonna call you back.

143
00:04:47,783 --> 00:04:49,309
That'd actually
be pretty sick.

144
00:04:49,393 --> 00:04:50,441
- Mm.
- Yeah, so now

145
00:04:50,525 --> 00:04:52,051
I'm really stoked
to get the vaccine.

146
00:04:52,135 --> 00:04:53,666
Hi.

147
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:56,229
Hi.

148
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,585
- It's good to...
- What are you do... I didn't...

149
00:04:57,669 --> 00:05:00,288
How... sorry.
Sorry, what?

150
00:05:01,187 --> 00:05:03,149
What are you doing here?

151
00:05:03,233 --> 00:05:04,411
You didn't know?

152
00:05:04,495 --> 00:05:06,569
Oh. Oh, God.

153
00:05:06,654 --> 00:05:08,735
Cheyenne, I thought you were
gonna tell him I was coming.

154
00:05:08,819 --> 00:05:09,895
Yeah, I was going to,

155
00:05:09,979 --> 00:05:11,988
but I figured
it would be awkward.

156
00:05:13,722 --> 00:05:15,640
Oh, well, I'm glad
we avoided that.

157
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:20,960
I know Amy being back
is a very big deal,

158
00:05:21,045 --> 00:05:22,441
so as her best friend,

159
00:05:22,526 --> 00:05:23,705
I'm just going to put to rest
any possible questions

160
00:05:23,789 --> 00:05:25,601
so we can save time.

161
00:05:25,686 --> 00:05:27,169
Yes, California is warm.

162
00:05:27,254 --> 00:05:29,851
No, Zephra does not have
those egg-shaped nap pods.

163
00:05:29,945 --> 00:05:32,140
Yes, she is roughly the same
weight as when she left,

164
00:05:32,225 --> 00:05:34,984
and, yes, Parker is still frail
and practically translucent.

165
00:05:35,069 --> 00:05:37,683
No, actually, Parker
is thriving in California.

166
00:05:37,768 --> 00:05:39,425
He loves it. Both kids do.

167
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:40,775
And so do I...

168
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:42,401
But I am happy
to see all of you.

169
00:05:42,485 --> 00:05:43,968
Okay, Amy, you heard me.
There's no time.

170
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:45,404
Then why did you bring up
my weight?

171
00:05:45,488 --> 00:05:47,319
You doing okay, bud?

172
00:05:47,403 --> 00:05:49,278
Me? Yeah, no.
I'm... yeah, I'm good.

173
00:05:49,362 --> 00:05:51,236
I'm... I'm great.

174
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,498
Cool.

175
00:05:52,582 --> 00:05:54,196
So Zephra is sending
an analyst today

176
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,371
to do a walk-through.

177
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:56,851
I thought I would
get here before her,

178
00:05:56,935 --> 00:05:58,113
help you whip
the store into shape

179
00:05:58,197 --> 00:05:59,331
so that they pick us.

180
00:05:59,415 --> 00:06:01,029
- I mean you.
- Question.

181
00:06:01,113 --> 00:06:02,378
What does this mean
for you and Jonah?

182
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:04,206
- No, this isn't about...
- No, we're not...

183
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:05,511
That's not what we're here for.

184
00:06:05,595 --> 00:06:07,035
Yeah, Sandra.
Besides, it doesn't matter.

185
00:06:07,119 --> 00:06:08,166
Jonah's seeing someone.

186
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,777
Oh, well,
that's great for Jonah.

187
00:06:10,861 --> 00:06:12,649
- It's none of my business.
- It's my lawyer,

188
00:06:12,733 --> 00:06:15,173
and she's a redhead,
so safe bet is,

189
00:06:15,257 --> 00:06:17,088
she's, like, the filthiest
freak in the world.

190
00:06:17,172 --> 00:06:18,307
Jonah, no!

191
00:06:18,391 --> 00:06:19,786
I'm begging you all,
please stop.

192
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:21,005
Also, Amy, you should know,

193
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:22,615
Kelly came back,
although nothing happened.

194
00:06:22,699 --> 00:06:23,790
Why should she know that?

195
00:06:23,874 --> 00:06:25,053
Oh, and he also
asked Nia out,

196
00:06:25,137 --> 00:06:26,184
but she's a lesbian.

197
00:06:26,268 --> 00:06:27,142
At least,
that's what she told him.

198
00:06:27,226 --> 00:06:28,839
No, I am a lesbian.

199
00:06:28,923 --> 00:06:30,580
Doesn't matter.
He's all about Amy now.

200
00:06:30,664 --> 00:06:33,844
Okay, guys, I get that
this is really interesting,

201
00:06:33,928 --> 00:06:36,542
but come on, we're trying
to save our store here.

202
00:06:36,626 --> 00:06:38,153
So why don't we split
into two meetings?

203
00:06:38,237 --> 00:06:39,676
Yeah, do you want
to take the store-saving one,

204
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,807
and I'll take
the Jonah-Amy one?

205
00:06:40,891 --> 00:06:41,983
- No.
- See, this is why

206
00:06:42,067 --> 00:06:43,245
we have two managers.

207
00:06:43,329 --> 00:06:44,376
I call Dina's meeting.

208
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:45,900
Okay, how about
zero meetings?

209
00:06:48,595 --> 00:06:50,774
<i>And dishwasher pods
are two-for-one</i>

210
00:06:50,858 --> 00:06:53,477
while supplies last,
so get 'em while you can.

211
00:06:53,774 --> 00:06:54,996
Meaning they might sell out,

212
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:58,221
not that the store's...
Uh, please hold.

213
00:06:58,812 --> 00:07:01,218
Don't worry, Jonah and Amy
will figure something out.

214
00:07:01,303 --> 00:07:02,264
They always do.

215
00:07:02,348 --> 00:07:03,526
Yeah, totally.

216
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:04,875
Hey, did she say hi to you?

217
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,050
Yeah, why?

218
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:07,747
Oh, no, it's nothing.
It's just that...

219
00:07:07,831 --> 00:07:09,053
I don't think
she said hi to me yet.

220
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,925
She said hi to everyone
this morning.

221
00:07:11,009 --> 00:07:13,188
No, she said, "Hi, everyone."

222
00:07:13,272 --> 00:07:15,842
Okay, so I'm just supposed
to share a hello with Elias?

223
00:07:15,926 --> 00:07:17,453
Nah, dude, I'm 40 years old.

224
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:19,020
I think she's just
a little preoccupied.

225
00:07:19,104 --> 00:07:20,891
Yeah, right, of course.

226
00:07:20,975 --> 00:07:22,893
I mean, I'm kidding.

227
00:07:22,977 --> 00:07:25,335
It would be funny if I cared,
though, right?

228
00:07:25,941 --> 00:07:27,119
Right.

229
00:07:27,305 --> 00:07:29,032
Okay, so they wouldn't
be sending someone

230
00:07:29,117 --> 00:07:31,728
all the way out here
if it was just about sales.

231
00:07:31,812 --> 00:07:33,860
I mean, my guess is they're
looking at soft factors,

232
00:07:33,944 --> 00:07:37,429
like aesthetics
and customer experience.

233
00:07:37,513 --> 00:07:38,580
Oh, boy, you think
they're gonna be looking

234
00:07:38,664 --> 00:07:40,128
at the Quincy store?

235
00:07:40,212 --> 00:07:43,087
We're up against
the Quincy Cloud 9,

236
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:45,046
the jewel of St. Louis?

237
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:48,179
The whole place
is so clean and beautiful,

238
00:07:48,263 --> 00:07:50,747
and they got the skylight
and the fresh-cut flowers,

239
00:07:50,831 --> 00:07:53,358
and their customers
are so pleasant to look at.

240
00:07:53,442 --> 00:07:56,231
I mean, not one of them makes
you wince when you see them.

241
00:07:56,315 --> 00:07:57,710
How do they do that?

242
00:07:57,794 --> 00:08:00,061
Yeah, we do seem to have
a high wince factor.

243
00:08:00,145 --> 00:08:02,628
I mean, I think that,
just for today,

244
00:08:02,712 --> 00:08:04,413
it would be okay to turn away

245
00:08:04,497 --> 00:08:06,023
some of our more colorful
clientele.

246
00:08:06,107 --> 00:08:07,894
No weirdos, no uggos.
I'm on it.

247
00:08:07,978 --> 00:08:09,766
Well, wait,
I'm gonna go with you,

248
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:11,594
'cause weirdos
have feelings too.

249
00:08:11,678 --> 00:08:13,683
You're right.
I should be more sensitive.

250
00:08:13,767 --> 00:08:16,032
I gotta remember, I've got
a cousin that's a weirdo.

251
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,514
Is it gonna be okay to...

252
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:19,602
leave you two alone together?

253
00:08:19,686 --> 00:08:21,734
- We'll be fine.
- All good, Dina.

254
00:08:21,818 --> 00:08:23,258
It just might be awkward,
because...

255
00:08:23,342 --> 00:08:25,046
Okay, thanks, Dina.

256
00:08:28,869 --> 00:08:31,226
- She's still got it.
- Yeah.

257
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:35,400
Look, I'm sorry that I just
sprung myself on you like this.

258
00:08:35,484 --> 00:08:36,749
Oh.

259
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:38,447
Yeah, we don't need to...

260
00:08:38,531 --> 00:08:39,796
It was nice
that you came to help,

261
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,059
but let's just do
the store today, okay?

262
00:08:42,143 --> 00:08:43,234
Yeah, yeah.

263
00:08:43,318 --> 00:08:44,714
- Of course. Cool.
- Okay.

264
00:08:44,798 --> 00:08:47,195
So if we're gonna be putting
our best foot forward,

265
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,675
should we just be sending
our worst employees home?

266
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:51,112
Well, I'm worried

267
00:08:51,196 --> 00:08:53,462
that if you start pulling
that thread, pretty soon...

268
00:08:53,546 --> 00:08:55,072
Yeah, no sweater.

269
00:08:55,156 --> 00:08:56,600
Yeah.

270
00:08:56,898 --> 00:08:58,684
Sorry, Puppet Mike,
you can't come in today.

271
00:08:58,768 --> 00:09:00,251
This is discrimination!

272
00:09:00,335 --> 00:09:02,340
No, no, no, it's just...
It's a no-freaks day.

273
00:09:02,424 --> 00:09:04,255
- You understand.
- Tell you what.

274
00:09:04,339 --> 00:09:05,561
Come back tomorrow,

275
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:07,519
and you'll both get
a cup of coffee on me.

276
00:09:07,603 --> 00:09:09,434
Go yourself!

277
00:09:09,518 --> 00:09:11,963
Chef Luigi!

278
00:09:13,256 --> 00:09:14,406
Okay, listen up.

279
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,398
The Zephra analyst
will be here this afternoon.

280
00:09:16,482 --> 00:09:18,313
Our only chance of survival

281
00:09:18,397 --> 00:09:20,750
is if she believes that this
is the best Cloud 9 around.

282
00:09:20,834 --> 00:09:22,665
We have to be
the perfect store.

283
00:09:22,749 --> 00:09:23,796
Uh...

284
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,146
Is the analyst Glenn?

285
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:26,799
'Cause if not,
that's a tough sell.

286
00:09:26,883 --> 00:09:28,236
Well, we'll do what we can.

287
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,802
We'll make it more homey

288
00:09:29,886 --> 00:09:33,154
with... with nice smells
and... and nice sounds,

289
00:09:33,238 --> 00:09:35,634
and we could throw
some flowers at her.

290
00:09:35,718 --> 00:09:36,635
Don't actually throw them.

291
00:09:36,719 --> 00:09:38,376
Just put them places.

292
00:09:42,029 --> 00:09:43,686
It's just,
how hard is it to say hi?

293
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:44,904
It's barely even a word.

294
00:09:44,988 --> 00:09:46,471
Wow. Those smell great.

295
00:09:46,555 --> 00:09:47,559
How much?

296
00:09:47,643 --> 00:09:49,170
Oh, they're not for sale.

297
00:09:49,254 --> 00:09:50,649
They're not even
shaped into cookies.

298
00:09:50,733 --> 00:09:52,608
It's just a mound.

299
00:09:54,259 --> 00:09:55,263
How much for the mound?

300
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:00,572
- That one's yours.
- Oh, wow. Hi.

301
00:10:00,656 --> 00:10:02,226
Who are you?

302
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,314
Our greeters for today.

303
00:10:03,398 --> 00:10:05,360
Dina said everyone at Quincy
was hot,

304
00:10:05,444 --> 00:10:06,883
so this is Dido and Bax.

305
00:10:06,967 --> 00:10:08,058
- Yo.
- Hi.

306
00:10:08,142 --> 00:10:09,233
Oh, his shirt comes off
if you want.

307
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:10,669
Nope.

308
00:10:10,753 --> 00:10:12,845
Ugh, Carol,
you shouldn't be doing this.

309
00:10:12,929 --> 00:10:14,238
Let me assist you.

310
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:15,718
- Really?
- Yes.

311
00:10:15,802 --> 00:10:16,806
Happy to be of assistance.

312
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:20,201
Like an assistant.

313
00:10:22,548 --> 00:10:23,726
This is nice, huh?

314
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:24,683
- Yeah.
- I mean, it's, you know...

315
00:10:24,767 --> 00:10:25,771
it's nicer.

316
00:10:25,855 --> 00:10:27,208
Yeah, we did what we could.

317
00:10:27,292 --> 00:10:28,731
- Yeah.
- You know, so who knows?

318
00:10:28,815 --> 00:10:30,733
Maybe we got a shot.

319
00:10:32,819 --> 00:10:36,608
Oh, my God, it's...
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

320
00:10:36,692 --> 00:10:38,219
Okay, Justine, calm down.

321
00:10:38,303 --> 00:10:39,872
No, that's
the right reaction.

322
00:10:39,956 --> 00:10:41,439
There's, like, eight
severed feet in there.

323
00:10:41,523 --> 00:10:43,930
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

324
00:10:44,922 --> 00:10:47,087
Okay, I gave Justine
a muscle relaxer

325
00:10:47,172 --> 00:10:48,327
and put her in her car.

326
00:10:48,412 --> 00:10:49,553
She keeps mumbling about feet,

327
00:10:49,637 --> 00:10:51,206
but that's not a forever thing,
I don't think.

328
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:52,425
This is horrible.

329
00:10:52,509 --> 00:10:54,467
I mean, we've had
severed feet before,

330
00:10:54,552 --> 00:10:56,376
but just a sprinkling,
you know,

331
00:10:56,461 --> 00:10:57,378
once in a while.

332
00:10:57,463 --> 00:10:59,271
It's okay.
We know the drill.

333
00:10:59,356 --> 00:11:00,943
I'll call Curtis
at the police station.

334
00:11:01,028 --> 00:11:02,857
He's our go-to for any
recovered body parts.

335
00:11:02,942 --> 00:11:04,029
Now, hang on, hang on.

336
00:11:04,114 --> 00:11:06,990
Before we turn this
into a full-on crime scene,

337
00:11:07,075 --> 00:11:10,081
what if, hypothetically,
we didn't find this bag of feet

338
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:12,345
until after
the Zephra analyst left?

339
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,857
Do you mean just, like,
ignore the bag

340
00:11:14,942 --> 00:11:17,349
of gross, dead feet
in the middle of the floor?

341
00:11:17,434 --> 00:11:19,439
I mean, it would be safer
to move it to the back.

342
00:11:19,524 --> 00:11:20,779
Safer for who?

343
00:11:20,842 --> 00:11:23,131
The foot slicer you're suddenly
trying to aid and abet?

344
00:11:23,216 --> 00:11:25,083
Yeah, Dina, you got me.
I'm in on it.

345
00:11:25,167 --> 00:11:26,911
I just happened
to show up in the store

346
00:11:26,995 --> 00:11:28,913
the day a bag of feet
was discovered, and...

347
00:11:28,997 --> 00:11:31,132
Okay, that sounds
more plausible than I...

348
00:11:31,216 --> 00:11:32,830
- I'm not in on it!
- Look.

349
00:11:32,914 --> 00:11:35,615
We can delay calling them in,
but we are not moving it, okay?

350
00:11:35,699 --> 00:11:37,138
That's called
evidence tampering.

351
00:11:37,222 --> 00:11:38,139
It's a criminal offense.

352
00:11:38,223 --> 00:11:39,140
Okay, fine.

353
00:11:39,224 --> 00:11:40,315
We won't move it.

354
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,969
This looks
completely natural.

355
00:11:42,053 --> 00:11:44,102
Just a drink display
in the bedding section.

356
00:11:44,186 --> 00:11:46,931
Obviously, the bag
of feet stays between us

357
00:11:47,015 --> 00:11:48,280
until we can call it in.

358
00:11:48,364 --> 00:11:49,455
Yeah, just real quick.

359
00:11:49,539 --> 00:11:50,761
I did mention it to Mateo.

360
00:11:50,845 --> 00:11:52,371
A bag full of feet?

361
00:11:52,455 --> 00:11:54,329
Mateo, I told you
not to tell.

362
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:55,983
I only told these two.

363
00:11:56,067 --> 00:11:57,507
Also, I texted Eric,
and he told his work,

364
00:11:57,591 --> 00:11:58,856
but that's it.

365
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:01,989
This is so not
a big deal, okay?

366
00:12:02,073 --> 00:12:04,383
I mean, of course, it is
for the victims' families,

367
00:12:04,467 --> 00:12:05,950
or, who knows,
maybe there's no victims.

368
00:12:06,034 --> 00:12:08,518
You know, maybe it's just
a med school prankster.

369
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:10,955
Or a grave robber
or morgue bandit.

370
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:13,653
Let's just stop guessing
and not tell anybody else.

371
00:12:13,737 --> 00:12:15,960
Yeah, and don't worry
that God is gonna be mad

372
00:12:16,044 --> 00:12:17,135
or hold us in judgement.

373
00:12:17,219 --> 00:12:18,528
We're doing the right thing,

374
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:20,268
or at least we will be
in a few hours

375
00:12:20,352 --> 00:12:21,661
when we stop doing this.

376
00:12:21,745 --> 00:12:23,228
Welcome to Cloud 9.

377
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,192
Ooh, Dido just texted.

378
00:12:31,276 --> 00:12:32,237
The analyst is here.

379
00:12:32,321 --> 00:12:33,543
Okay, it's go time.

380
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:35,153
Janet's outside on freak watch.

381
00:12:35,237 --> 00:12:38,417
Glenn, you guard the duffel bag
and keep tall people away.

382
00:12:38,501 --> 00:12:39,679
I'm gonna cover Megan,

383
00:12:39,763 --> 00:12:41,464
and Amy's gonna coordinate
from the back.

384
00:12:41,548 --> 00:12:42,856
Exactly, because Megan and I

385
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,162
have been in work meetings
together,

386
00:12:44,246 --> 00:12:45,206
so she knows what I look like.

387
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:46,469
Mm, does she?

388
00:12:46,553 --> 00:12:47,557
Or do you just know
what she looks like?

389
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:48,688
Doesn't always go both ways.

390
00:12:48,772 --> 00:12:50,429
She knows who I am, Dina.

391
00:12:50,513 --> 00:12:52,039
Great. Up top.

392
00:12:53,385 --> 00:12:55,260
Come on.

393
00:12:55,344 --> 00:12:56,609
Hi. Hey.

394
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:59,569
Uh, can I help you
with anything, or...

395
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:01,178
I think I'm okay.
Thanks, though.

396
00:13:01,263 --> 00:13:02,092
Cool, no problem. Yeah.

397
00:13:02,177 --> 00:13:03,224
We're all about
customer service here,

398
00:13:03,308 --> 00:13:04,522
so anything you need...

399
00:13:04,607 --> 00:13:05,836
Yeah, where are your candles?

400
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,881
They're just, uh,
right over there.

401
00:13:07,966 --> 00:13:09,764
Anyways, you need something,
let me know.

402
00:13:09,849 --> 00:13:11,015
- Can you just show me?
- Sorry, sir,

403
00:13:11,099 --> 00:13:12,414
if you just walk in that
direction, you'll find them.

404
00:13:12,498 --> 00:13:15,108
So... uh, I'm kidding, of course.

405
00:13:15,193 --> 00:13:18,463
I'm gonna take you to them
because that's what I do.

406
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:20,760
Right this way. Thanks.

407
00:13:20,845 --> 00:13:22,461
So what are they like?

408
00:13:22,545 --> 00:13:24,071
Candles?

409
00:13:25,415 --> 00:13:27,292
Elias, stop staring at her.

410
00:13:27,376 --> 00:13:29,903
Oh, can somebody get a U-boat
over to aisle four

411
00:13:29,987 --> 00:13:32,123
so she doesn't trip
over that wonky floor tile?

412
00:13:32,207 --> 00:13:33,341
Hey.

413
00:13:33,425 --> 00:13:34,386
I thought you might
want a snack

414
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:35,866
since you're stuck back here.

415
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:38,912
So you thought I was gonna
eat five bags of Doritos?

416
00:13:38,996 --> 00:13:40,392
No, I just wanted
to give you flavor options.

417
00:13:40,476 --> 00:13:41,654
I'll put the rest of them back.

418
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:43,830
No, I don't want to make
more work for you.

419
00:13:43,914 --> 00:13:46,446
Thank you. Very thoughtful.

420
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:49,053
Hey, it really means a lot
that you came back here

421
00:13:49,137 --> 00:13:51,261
even knowing you'd have to deal
with the Jonah of it all.

422
00:13:51,345 --> 00:13:52,404
Yeah, well, I mean,

423
00:13:52,488 --> 00:13:54,493
it's less weird
than I thought it would be.

424
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:56,321
It's actually kinda nice.

425
00:13:56,405 --> 00:13:57,955
I mean, it's nice
to see everybody.

426
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,424
Anyway, so you're really
not with Garrett?

427
00:14:00,509 --> 00:14:01,900
Oh, he wishes.

428
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,424
Yeah, he's obsessed with me.

429
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,533
I'll take pity on him.
We go to the odd dinner.

430
00:14:05,618 --> 00:14:07,441
I spend, like, three nights
a week at his house.

431
00:14:07,525 --> 00:14:08,916
We take weekend trips.

432
00:14:09,001 --> 00:14:10,988
He loves it.
It's pathetic.

433
00:14:12,374 --> 00:14:13,727
What is she doing?

434
00:14:13,951 --> 00:14:15,433
She's calling someone.

435
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:19,142
She's calling me.

436
00:14:19,228 --> 00:14:20,672
Why is she calling me?

437
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:23,572
Okay, I'm gonna call her back
from the office.

438
00:14:23,657 --> 00:14:24,791
Hey, do you want...

439
00:14:24,876 --> 00:14:27,918
Yeah. That's what I thought.

440
00:14:28,002 --> 00:14:31,095
<i>♪ This fire
down in my soul ♪</i>

441
00:14:31,179 --> 00:14:34,354
<i>♪ Now can't you see
it's burning out of control ♪</i>

442
00:14:34,439 --> 00:14:36,120
Hey, sorry to make you
hop on a call.

443
00:14:36,205 --> 00:14:37,774
Oh, please. Come on.

444
00:14:37,858 --> 00:14:39,298
We are in a pandemic, girl.

445
00:14:39,382 --> 00:14:41,039
I'm either talking to you
or my houseplants.

446
00:14:42,164 --> 00:14:43,733
<i>Don't you have two children?</i>

447
00:14:43,818 --> 00:14:45,649
I do. Yeah, I do.

448
00:14:45,734 --> 00:14:47,000
Uh, so what's up?

449
00:14:47,129 --> 00:14:49,221
Well, I was looking
at the store schematics,

450
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:52,311
and the café and pharmacy
are complete flipped.

451
00:14:52,395 --> 00:14:53,747
Just wanna make sure
you sent the right ones.

452
00:14:53,831 --> 00:14:56,141
Oh, yeah, actually,
when the tornado happened...

453
00:14:56,225 --> 00:14:58,056
Hey, you know,
I think it's really messed up

454
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,187
that you came
all the way back here

455
00:14:59,271 --> 00:15:00,932
and you haven't even
said hi to me.

456
00:15:01,695 --> 00:15:03,396
I'm so sorry, Megan,

457
00:15:03,481 --> 00:15:05,616
my neighbor just barged in.

458
00:15:05,701 --> 00:15:08,712
That work-from-home life,
am I right?

459
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:12,374
Also, you left your
trash cans in my driveway.

460
00:15:12,618 --> 00:15:14,868
Whoa, was that
just an earthquake?

461
00:15:14,953 --> 00:15:16,392
Nope. False alarm.

462
00:15:16,477 --> 00:15:19,228
You never do know
out here in California.

463
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:22,384
Sorry, sir,
I'm gonna have to ask you

464
00:15:22,469 --> 00:15:23,819
to step back a few feet.

465
00:15:23,904 --> 00:15:25,387
I mean yards.
Yards, you know.

466
00:15:25,471 --> 00:15:26,910
Forget what I said about feet.

467
00:15:26,994 --> 00:15:28,042
Just forget it.

468
00:15:28,126 --> 00:15:29,217
You good, Glenn?

469
00:15:29,301 --> 00:15:30,650
No, I'm not good.

470
00:15:30,735 --> 00:15:32,436
Tell me, how do you think
he removed them?

471
00:15:32,521 --> 00:15:35,531
Do you think maybe they just
fell off like acorns?

472
00:15:35,616 --> 00:15:37,883
You know what, buddy? Maybe.

473
00:15:37,993 --> 00:15:39,432
Feet!

474
00:15:39,572 --> 00:15:40,794
- No, no, Marcus!
- Shh!

475
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:42,103
No, you don't understand,

476
00:15:42,203 --> 00:15:43,650
there's a bunch
of ♪♪♪♪ feet here.

477
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:45,073
I just came to move these
out of bedding,

478
00:15:45,157 --> 00:15:46,626
'cause, like, why are there
drinks here?

479
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:49,107
- And then boom!
- Six severed feet!

480
00:15:49,191 --> 00:15:50,673
Well, it's eight,
but it's fine.

481
00:15:50,757 --> 00:15:52,675
Just calm down,
and we'll explain everything.

482
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:54,764
I'm sorry, did you just say
"severed feet"?

483
00:15:54,848 --> 00:15:57,506
Yeah, but we're pretty sure
they just fell off like acorns.

484
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:58,942
Why are you guys acting
like this is normal?

485
00:15:59,026 --> 00:16:00,326
It's ♪♪♪♪ sick!

486
00:16:00,411 --> 00:16:01,850
There's eight feet
in a duffel bag!

487
00:16:01,935 --> 00:16:02,990
Wow, that's crazy.

488
00:16:03,074 --> 00:16:04,252
Yeah, I don't remember that,

489
00:16:04,336 --> 00:16:05,993
but "Lost" did get pretty weird
at the end.

490
00:16:06,077 --> 00:16:08,126
Ah, this is so disgusting
and scary.

491
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:09,257
This is what I'll think about

492
00:16:09,341 --> 00:16:10,549
every time I come
into the store.

493
00:16:10,633 --> 00:16:12,321
Marcus! Stop.

494
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:20,212
We can't let a bag of feet

495
00:16:20,297 --> 00:16:21,986
be her last impression
of the store.

496
00:16:22,071 --> 00:16:23,126
I know.

497
00:16:23,211 --> 00:16:25,718
I'd go talk to her,
but I only know who she is

498
00:16:25,803 --> 00:16:27,479
because of you. She'd know
that you were helping us.

499
00:16:27,563 --> 00:16:29,071
Oh, I could slash her tires

500
00:16:29,156 --> 00:16:30,364
to keep her here longer.

501
00:16:30,449 --> 00:16:32,193
Huh, I don't know
what car is hers,

502
00:16:32,277 --> 00:16:34,021
so I guess I could
just do them all.

503
00:16:34,105 --> 00:16:36,589
Um, thanks, Chey,
but maybe not yet.

504
00:16:36,673 --> 00:16:37,815
- Okay.
- Hey, guys, we'd love

505
00:16:37,899 --> 00:16:39,427
to get an employee's thoughts
on all of this.

506
00:16:39,511 --> 00:16:41,690
Would any of you be willing
to do an interview?

507
00:16:41,775 --> 00:16:42,692
- No, we're not gonna do that.
- Uh...

508
00:16:42,777 --> 00:16:44,177
It'll just take a minute.

509
00:16:44,758 --> 00:16:46,985
Actually, yeah, I... I will.

510
00:16:48,517 --> 00:16:50,626
So I cleaned out all the old
Filet-O-Fish boxes

511
00:16:50,711 --> 00:16:52,915
from your trunk, except
for the one labeled "private,"

512
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,049
which I will neither judge
nor ask questions about.

513
00:16:55,134 --> 00:16:56,660
Mateo, thank you.

514
00:16:56,745 --> 00:16:58,576
You know what?
You've convinced me.

515
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:01,826
- You're hired.
- Oh, thank God.

516
00:17:01,965 --> 00:17:03,745
I mean, I really hope
we save this place,

517
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:05,922
but it's starting to give off
a real "portal to hell" vibe.

518
00:17:06,006 --> 00:17:09,290
- Mm.
- How about 25 an hour?

519
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,407
Sure.

520
00:17:10,492 --> 00:17:11,753
So that means I can hire you

521
00:17:11,838 --> 00:17:13,234
for about eight hours total.

522
00:17:13,318 --> 00:17:15,071
Does next Tuesday work for you?

523
00:17:15,174 --> 00:17:17,005
Just one day?

524
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:18,922
I was thinking it would be more
of a full-time thing,

525
00:17:19,006 --> 00:17:21,011
you know,
just so I could eat and stuff.

526
00:17:21,096 --> 00:17:22,460
I don't have
that kind of money.

527
00:17:22,545 --> 00:17:24,114
What?
You just got a huge settlement.

528
00:17:24,198 --> 00:17:25,665
Yeah, I thought so, too,

529
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,774
but when you add up lawyer fees
and taxes

530
00:17:27,859 --> 00:17:29,298
and all my texts
they discovered

531
00:17:29,383 --> 00:17:30,900
about wanting
to get injured here,

532
00:17:30,985 --> 00:17:33,208
it ended up only being
about 20 thou.

533
00:17:33,486 --> 00:17:34,794
Anyway, I'm gonna try

534
00:17:34,879 --> 00:17:36,550
to get Cheyenne's friend
to take his shirt off.

535
00:17:36,634 --> 00:17:37,986
You do that.

536
00:17:38,071 --> 00:17:39,250
Today, a new chapter

537
00:17:39,335 --> 00:17:41,514
in one of St. Louis's
darkest stories.

538
00:17:41,659 --> 00:17:44,415
A duffel bag filled
with eight severed human feet

539
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,827
has turned up inside

540
00:17:45,912 --> 00:17:48,135
the Ozark Highlands
Cloud 9 store.

541
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:51,509
One employee has agreed
to tell us what he knows.

542
00:17:52,082 --> 00:17:53,735
Jonah, this is not
the first time

543
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,260
feet have been found here.

544
00:17:55,345 --> 00:17:57,611
In fact, the internet
has already dubbed this store

545
00:17:57,696 --> 00:17:58,923
Toe-zark Highlands.

546
00:17:59,008 --> 00:17:59,969
Is that... is that so?

547
00:18:00,054 --> 00:18:02,189
That's the first
I'm hearing of it.

548
00:18:02,605 --> 00:18:04,088
Why do you think he or she...

549
00:18:04,297 --> 00:18:06,563
But let's be honest, he...
Sees your store

550
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:08,189
as an ideal dumping ground?

551
00:18:08,274 --> 00:18:11,454
<i>Uh, well, Natalie,
he probably likes it</i>

552
00:18:11,539 --> 00:18:13,371
<i>for the same reason
everybody else does, you know.</i>

553
00:18:13,455 --> 00:18:16,200
<i>Our fast and friendly service,
our convenient parking,</i>

554
00:18:16,285 --> 00:18:17,811
<i>and our strong sense
of community.</i>

555
00:18:17,896 --> 00:18:18,790
<i>I see.</i>

556
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:20,460
I don't think
he answered her question.

557
00:18:20,545 --> 00:18:22,119
Yeah, it's a tough pivot.

558
00:18:22,204 --> 00:18:23,609
This is the first time

559
00:18:23,693 --> 00:18:25,872
multiple feet
have been delivered at once.

560
00:18:25,956 --> 00:18:27,979
Do you believe
this is some sort

561
00:18:28,064 --> 00:18:29,789
of gruesome final event?

562
00:18:29,873 --> 00:18:31,814
I don't know why you think

563
00:18:31,899 --> 00:18:34,165
I would have anything useful
to say on that front,

564
00:18:34,267 --> 00:18:36,838
um, but you know
what's never final?

565
00:18:36,946 --> 00:18:38,777
Any purchase
that you make here.

566
00:18:38,862 --> 00:18:40,307
Let me... let me tell you
about our return policy.

567
00:18:40,391 --> 00:18:42,714
So you're not concerned
this is hurting business?

568
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:45,251
I might think twice
about shopping at this store.

569
00:18:45,336 --> 00:18:47,036
<i>Okay, yeah,
a lot of feet turn up here.</i>

570
00:18:47,137 --> 00:18:49,360
<i>I'm sorry we're not
literally perfect, Natalie.</i>

571
00:18:49,632 --> 00:18:51,467
Yikes.

572
00:18:52,301 --> 00:18:55,499
We just... we... we keep trying
to show everybody

573
00:18:55,584 --> 00:18:59,591
that we're the perfect store,
and the truth is we're not.

574
00:18:59,676 --> 00:19:01,811
Okay? We're... we're just us,

575
00:19:01,903 --> 00:19:04,648
but we're here
every single day.

576
00:19:04,733 --> 00:19:08,436
When it rains, when it snows,
when it... when it tornadoes,

577
00:19:08,549 --> 00:19:10,741
when there's a plague
and you're all safe at home,

578
00:19:10,826 --> 00:19:12,346
<i>except for when you come here
to cough,</i>

579
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:15,741
<i>we're here just... just trying
to get you what you need,</i>

580
00:19:15,826 --> 00:19:20,001
and... and all we want
is to keep doing that.

581
00:19:22,844 --> 00:19:24,327
Emotions running high here,

582
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:26,977
preventing people
from staying on topic.

583
00:19:27,062 --> 00:19:28,650
Back to you, Skip.

584
00:19:33,559 --> 00:19:34,985
That was great.

585
00:19:39,029 --> 00:19:40,603
Really?

586
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:42,522
- Yeah.
- You guys,

587
00:19:42,607 --> 00:19:44,094
she's heading out.

588
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:47,331
Okay.

589
00:19:47,581 --> 00:19:49,977
Wait, Amy, no, what are you...
She can't know that you're...

590
00:19:50,475 --> 00:19:52,702
Megan.

591
00:19:53,846 --> 00:19:55,837
Yep, that's right.

592
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:57,697
I've been here the whole time.

593
00:19:59,162 --> 00:20:00,775
Amy Sosa.

594
00:20:01,126 --> 00:20:02,689
Oh, right.

595
00:20:02,774 --> 00:20:04,910
I'm sorry, I didn't know
what you looked like.

596
00:20:05,252 --> 00:20:07,134
- Don't tell Dina.
- Never.

597
00:20:07,219 --> 00:20:09,104
Wait, why are you here?

598
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:11,474
Look, um...

599
00:20:12,152 --> 00:20:14,331
I know that
the foot thing is bad.

600
00:20:14,524 --> 00:20:16,268
I'm not trying
to say that it's not,

601
00:20:16,353 --> 00:20:18,576
but you can't close this store.

602
00:20:18,661 --> 00:20:20,126
You just... you can't.

603
00:20:20,236 --> 00:20:22,845
I... I don't have
a good reason why,

604
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:26,337
but these people are my family.

605
00:20:26,542 --> 00:20:28,024
I... I... I grew up here.

606
00:20:28,109 --> 00:20:30,158
I spent half of my life...

607
00:20:30,243 --> 00:20:32,335
Amy, we're not closing
this one.

608
00:20:32,691 --> 00:20:34,048
What?

609
00:20:34,176 --> 00:20:35,920
Really?

610
00:20:36,005 --> 00:20:37,836
It has great square footage,
nice and central.

611
00:20:37,927 --> 00:20:40,372
It'll make a perfect
fulfillment center.

612
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:42,611
- A fulfillment center?
- Mm-hmm.

613
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:46,150
So it's not gonna
be a store anymore?

614
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:49,305
Well, what about
everybody's jobs?

615
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:53,665
Well, I'm sure they'll keep
a handful of people, but...

616
00:20:54,216 --> 00:20:55,290
No.

617
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:57,587
You can't just do this to us.

618
00:20:57,672 --> 00:21:01,196
Well, Amy,
you'll keep your job.

619
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:09,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

620
00:21:11,692 --> 00:21:13,249
No, I won't,

621
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:16,534
'cause I quit.

622
00:21:26,449 --> 00:21:27,634
Can I help you
with something?

623
00:21:27,741 --> 00:21:28,825
Oh, hi.

624
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:29,827
Um, it's Amy.

625
00:21:29,912 --> 00:21:31,431
We met, like, a month ago.

626
00:21:31,544 --> 00:21:33,462
I thought I'd show up
on the last day

627
00:21:33,546 --> 00:21:34,672
and surprise everybody.

628
00:21:34,756 --> 00:21:35,965
That's so nice.

629
00:21:36,049 --> 00:21:37,258
What's the surprise?

630
00:21:37,342 --> 00:21:39,302
Um, just me.

631
00:21:39,386 --> 00:21:41,679
Oh, I thought it would be,
like, doughnuts or something.

632
00:21:41,763 --> 00:21:44,974
Amy, it's so good to see you!

633
00:21:45,058 --> 00:21:47,309
Sandra, hi!

634
00:21:47,393 --> 00:21:49,186
- Hi!
- What are you doing here?

635
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:50,855
I wanted to see everybody
one last time.

636
00:21:50,939 --> 00:21:53,357
So you're back
from California.

637
00:21:53,441 --> 00:21:55,318
That's so great.

638
00:21:55,402 --> 00:21:56,193
Don't worry.

639
00:21:56,277 --> 00:21:57,695
You and Eric
can stay in my house

640
00:21:57,779 --> 00:21:58,946
as long as you need.

641
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:01,032
- Thank God. Love you.
- So glad you're back.

642
00:22:01,116 --> 00:22:02,825
Welcome home.

643
00:22:02,909 --> 00:22:04,368
Thank you.

644
00:22:04,452 --> 00:22:05,995
It's good to be home.

645
00:22:06,871 --> 00:22:09,040
Amy!

646
00:22:09,124 --> 00:22:12,501
- Glenn, hi.
- I am so happy to see you.

647
00:22:12,585 --> 00:22:14,336
I wasn't gonna not
say goodbye.

648
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:16,172
We are so short‐staffed
today.

649
00:22:16,256 --> 00:22:17,465
No, I wasn't planning on...
Just tell you what.

650
00:22:17,549 --> 00:22:19,508
- Grab a vest in the back.
- I've got something I gotta...

651
00:22:19,592 --> 00:22:21,010
- We're super light in Grocery.
- But the thing is, I had a...

652
00:22:21,094 --> 00:22:23,179
Just do whatever you can do.

653
00:22:23,263 --> 00:22:27,641
My God, this is like God
sent me a literal angel.

654
00:22:29,461 --> 00:22:31,213
Like I said, welcome home.

655
00:22:34,074 --> 00:22:35,900
<font color=♪FF00FF>♪SUPERSTORE♪</font>
<font color=♪00FF00>Season 06 Episode 15</font>

656
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:37,883
Episode Title:
<font color=#FFc30f>"All Sales Final"</font>

657
00:22:37,968 --> 00:22:39,853
Aired on:
<font color="#00ffff">March 25, 2021</font>

658
00:22:39,994 --> 00:22:41,244
Attention, shoppers.

659
00:22:41,328 --> 00:22:43,872
It's the final day
of our liquidation sale

660
00:22:43,956 --> 00:22:45,540
before the doors
close for good.

661
00:22:45,624 --> 00:22:47,392
Our selection's
fairly picked over,

662
00:22:47,477 --> 00:22:49,710
but the following items
are still available:

663
00:22:49,795 --> 00:22:53,215
Irregular ladies' golf shoes
size 14 and above,

664
00:22:53,299 --> 00:22:55,282
grape‐scented
laundry detergent,

665
00:22:55,367 --> 00:22:58,386
and the VHS box set
of "Sweet Valley High."

666
00:22:58,471 --> 00:23:01,056
What'll Jessica and Elizabeth
get into next?

667
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,891
Buy 'em while you can,
or else wait a day

668
00:23:02,975 --> 00:23:04,935
and fish 'em out
of our dumpster.

669
00:23:06,937 --> 00:23:08,396
There she is,

670
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,689
back in the blue.

671
00:23:09,773 --> 00:23:12,025
- Like I never left.
- Hey, I heard the news.

672
00:23:12,109 --> 00:23:13,902
Congratulations,

673
00:23:13,986 --> 00:23:15,278
Miss Fulfillment Center
Manager.

674
00:23:15,362 --> 00:23:17,447
- I haven't told anyone yet.
- Oh.

675
00:23:17,531 --> 00:23:18,573
As soon as it gets out,

676
00:23:18,657 --> 00:23:20,117
everyone's gonna start
asking me for a job,

677
00:23:20,201 --> 00:23:22,160
and Zephra's already filled
most of the openings.

678
00:23:22,244 --> 00:23:23,912
I can only keep five people,

679
00:23:23,996 --> 00:23:26,414
and it is tougher
than I thought it would be.

680
00:23:26,498 --> 00:23:28,291
So there's no one
you want to take with you?

681
00:23:28,375 --> 00:23:30,210
No, actually,
everyone has their strengths.

682
00:23:30,294 --> 00:23:32,045
You know, Marcus has
warehouse experience.

683
00:23:32,129 --> 00:23:33,922
Janet's good under pressure.

684
00:23:34,006 --> 00:23:35,757
Jonah's smart, but I don't even
know if he's staying in town

685
00:23:35,841 --> 00:23:37,259
since him and Hannah broke up.

686
00:23:37,343 --> 00:23:38,093
What?

687
00:23:38,177 --> 00:23:39,594
- They broke up?
- Yeah.

688
00:23:39,678 --> 00:23:41,475
Uh, why? Why?

689
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,270
I hadn't heard that.
Why did they break up?

690
00:23:43,439 --> 00:23:45,767
You know, I'm not sure.

691
00:23:45,936 --> 00:23:47,806
Why are you so interested?

692
00:23:48,854 --> 00:23:50,604
Because it's interesting.

693
00:23:50,689 --> 00:23:53,108
I mean, all kinds of things
are interesting.

694
00:23:53,192 --> 00:23:55,246
You know, lots of things
are interesting

695
00:23:55,331 --> 00:23:56,582
if you really think about it.

696
00:23:56,743 --> 00:23:57,946
Uh‐huh.

697
00:24:00,074 --> 00:24:01,658
So...

698
00:24:01,742 --> 00:24:02,993
retirement, huh?

699
00:24:03,077 --> 00:24:04,161
Got any big plans?

700
00:24:04,245 --> 00:24:05,996
Yeah, I think I might finally

701
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,789
watch "The Queen's Gambit."

702
00:24:07,873 --> 00:24:09,791
Okay, so that's...

703
00:24:09,875 --> 00:24:11,018
seven episodes.

704
00:24:11,103 --> 00:24:12,752
What else?

705
00:24:12,999 --> 00:24:15,669
Well, I hadn't really
thought much beyond that.

706
00:24:16,382 --> 00:24:18,091
Gosh, I guess there's
gonna be a lot of hours

707
00:24:18,175 --> 00:24:19,468
to fill, huh?

708
00:24:19,552 --> 00:24:21,970
Yeah, yeah, but that's
a good thing, right, Glenn?

709
00:24:22,054 --> 00:24:23,638
I mean, I'm sure
you've got hobbies.

710
00:24:23,722 --> 00:24:26,475
No, 'cause work
is all I've ever known, Jonah.

711
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:28,852
I mean, I started
at my dad's hardware store

712
00:24:28,936 --> 00:24:30,145
when I was eight,

713
00:24:30,229 --> 00:24:31,980
and before that,
I worked at the tollbooth.

714
00:24:32,064 --> 00:24:33,648
Glenn, I'm sure
you're gonna be fine.

715
00:24:33,732 --> 00:24:36,151
There's gotta be
something that you can do.

716
00:24:37,361 --> 00:24:39,196
Well, what if I got
a 500‐piece puzzle?

717
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,531
That'd take up
some time, right?

718
00:24:41,615 --> 00:24:42,866
Some.

719
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:45,535
What, you want me to get
a 1,000‐piece puzzle?

720
00:24:45,619 --> 00:24:48,580
How much table space
do you think I have, Jonah?

721
00:24:50,667 --> 00:24:52,250
- Yeah, we could, like,
- Yeah.

722
00:24:52,335 --> 00:24:54,040
You know... get it...

723
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:55,295
Smart time to buy
a new washer.

724
00:24:55,379 --> 00:24:57,297
Oh, actually,
Bo wants to buy them all.

725
00:24:57,381 --> 00:24:59,382
- Oh.
- Yeah, get 'em for mad cheap,

726
00:24:59,466 --> 00:25:00,842
then resell them
to the suckers,

727
00:25:00,926 --> 00:25:01,968
make that scrilla.

728
00:25:02,052 --> 00:25:03,011
What if you can't sell 'em?

729
00:25:03,095 --> 00:25:04,888
Then I open up a laundromat.

730
00:25:04,972 --> 00:25:06,223
Come on, man, think.

731
00:25:06,307 --> 00:25:07,515
Use those glasses.

732
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:09,893
Well, I guess you have
more of a plan than I do

733
00:25:09,977 --> 00:25:11,519
since I'm basically
unhirable now.

734
00:25:11,603 --> 00:25:13,855
Mm, plight
of the undocumented, man,

735
00:25:13,939 --> 00:25:15,857
and yet the 1% and whatnots.

736
00:25:15,941 --> 00:25:17,400
You always know what to say.

737
00:25:17,484 --> 00:25:18,902
Well, you can always
come over to our place

738
00:25:18,986 --> 00:25:20,528
and do your laundry.

739
00:25:20,612 --> 00:25:21,488
Thanks, Chey.

740
00:25:21,572 --> 00:25:24,783
For a price
that is reasonable.

741
00:25:24,867 --> 00:25:29,037
<i>♪ When the dance is through,
it's me and you ♪</i>

742
00:25:29,121 --> 00:25:31,248
<i>♪ Come on,
would it really be ♪</i>

743
00:25:31,332 --> 00:25:34,209
Why is this not... what the...

744
00:25:34,293 --> 00:25:36,253
Well, well, well...

745
00:25:36,337 --> 00:25:37,712
Little Miss Corporate
spent so much time

746
00:25:37,796 --> 00:25:38,922
at her cushy desk job,

747
00:25:39,006 --> 00:25:40,507
she forgot how a scanner works.

748
00:25:40,591 --> 00:25:42,384
No, I did not. I just...
I think this one's broken.

749
00:25:42,468 --> 00:25:43,843
- I'm messing with you.
- I'm messing with you.

750
00:25:43,927 --> 00:25:46,346
They switched us over to CCDs.
Here, look.

751
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:48,390
You have to press these two
buttons at the same time,

752
00:25:48,474 --> 00:25:49,766
and you've gotta
get it closer

753
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:51,226
than you did with the lasers.

754
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:53,436
- Got it.
- Thank you for the pro tip.

755
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,896
You know, it's always nice

756
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:56,565
when a, uh, working stiff
like me

757
00:25:56,649 --> 00:25:58,358
can help out a fancy dame,
you know?

758
00:25:58,442 --> 00:25:59,901
You know,
I still have no idea

759
00:25:59,985 --> 00:26:01,236
what that accent is,

760
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,737
and I think it's gotten worse.

761
00:26:02,821 --> 00:26:03,905
Oh, oh, come on, now.

762
00:26:03,989 --> 00:26:05,699
I'm a little rusty, you know?

763
00:26:05,783 --> 00:26:08,159
I haven't done it
in a New York minute.

764
00:26:08,243 --> 00:26:10,745
Maybe the accent
goes away with the store.

765
00:26:11,872 --> 00:26:13,415
Speaking of which,

766
00:26:13,499 --> 00:26:15,083
what are your plans

767
00:26:15,167 --> 00:26:17,586
in a post‐Cloud 9 world?

768
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:19,087
Uh, well, I mean,

769
00:26:19,171 --> 00:26:20,755
I'll grieve, obviously,

770
00:26:20,839 --> 00:26:22,257
for the obligatory 90 days.

771
00:26:22,341 --> 00:26:23,425
Obviously. Me too.

772
00:26:23,509 --> 00:26:24,759
- Full veil and everything.
- Yeah, for sure.

773
00:26:24,843 --> 00:26:26,261
And then, yeah, I don't know.
I don't know.

774
00:26:26,345 --> 00:26:27,596
I got a lot to figure out,
you know,

775
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,611
like, am I gonna
move back to Chicago or...

776
00:26:29,696 --> 00:26:31,281
Oh.

777
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:34,769
I mean, just that Chicago
has all that wind,

778
00:26:34,853 --> 00:26:36,104
and Hannah's here.

779
00:26:36,188 --> 00:26:37,650
Oh, we broke up.

780
00:26:37,735 --> 00:26:39,480
- What?
- Oh, no.

781
00:26:39,565 --> 00:26:40,941
- I'm so sorry.
- It's fine.

782
00:26:41,026 --> 00:26:43,445
No, it's... I mean, we only
dated for, like, a month.

783
00:26:43,529 --> 00:26:46,229
Oh, man, that is
not long enough.

784
00:26:46,314 --> 00:26:49,166
Well, I had no idea
that you two had broken up.

785
00:26:49,251 --> 00:26:50,502
Yes, you did.

786
00:26:50,587 --> 00:26:52,634
I told you they broke up,
like, ten minutes ago.

787
00:26:52,719 --> 00:26:54,262
No, you didn't.

788
00:26:54,689 --> 00:26:56,124
Oh.

789
00:26:56,298 --> 00:26:57,792
No, I didn't tell you that.

790
00:26:57,876 --> 00:26:59,798
It was the other
Latina employee,

791
00:26:59,883 --> 00:27:02,096
and you all look the same to me

792
00:27:02,181 --> 00:27:03,756
because I'm a racist,

793
00:27:03,841 --> 00:27:07,181
so that's something
I should probably work on.

794
00:27:11,779 --> 00:27:13,697
She still thinks
Sandra's Latina.

795
00:27:17,595 --> 00:27:18,679
There's balls, and...

796
00:27:18,764 --> 00:27:21,001
oh, what about boxing
as a hobby?

797
00:27:21,086 --> 00:27:23,129
You look great
in silk shorts.

798
00:27:23,213 --> 00:27:25,089
I know,
but I'm just uncomfortable

799
00:27:25,173 --> 00:27:26,215
with the punching.

800
00:27:26,299 --> 00:27:28,676
Well, yeah, there's a lot
of punching in it.

801
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,137
Well, what about,
uh, fishing?

802
00:27:31,221 --> 00:27:32,972
A lot of retired people
like that.

803
00:27:33,056 --> 00:27:34,974
- What would be the point?
- I can't eat the fish.

804
00:27:35,058 --> 00:27:36,976
His throat's a bone magnet.

805
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:38,644
You know, Mateo, it's funny.

806
00:27:38,728 --> 00:27:40,688
You're undocumented,
and I'm over 60,

807
00:27:40,772 --> 00:27:43,483
and America doesn't want
either of us to work anymore.

808
00:27:43,567 --> 00:27:45,318
Right, but...

809
00:27:45,402 --> 00:27:47,153
I'm under constant fear
of deportation,

810
00:27:47,237 --> 00:27:49,489
and you get discounts
at movie theaters, so...

811
00:27:49,573 --> 00:27:50,742
Not new releases.

812
00:27:50,827 --> 00:27:54,285
Wow, must be awful
to live in terror of spoilers.

813
00:27:54,369 --> 00:27:56,204
Excuse me.

814
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:58,906
Ooh, what about grilling?

815
00:27:58,991 --> 00:28:00,617
That could be fun.

816
00:28:00,737 --> 00:28:02,363
Okay, Jerusha, no offense,

817
00:28:02,448 --> 00:28:04,783
but you are spiraling
right now.

818
00:28:04,929 --> 00:28:06,339
Yeah, I'm hoping
I can get another

819
00:28:06,423 --> 00:28:07,679
floor supervisor job.

820
00:28:07,764 --> 00:28:09,515
I just bought a ton
of clipboards.

821
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,726
What about you, Ames?

822
00:28:10,811 --> 00:28:12,063
Have you thought about
what you want to do next?

823
00:28:12,147 --> 00:28:13,940
I mean, I have
some interviews lined up.

824
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:15,734
Turns out,
once you've been an executive,

825
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:17,612
it's kind of easy
to stay an executive.

826
00:28:17,697 --> 00:28:18,684
- Nice.
- Hmm.

827
00:28:18,768 --> 00:28:21,015
Hey, so, um...

828
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:24,196
how upset was Jonah

829
00:28:24,281 --> 00:28:25,615
when I left?

830
00:28:26,619 --> 00:28:28,412
Oh, I'd say...

831
00:28:28,653 --> 00:28:30,289
- pretty upset.
- Pretty upset.

832
00:28:30,374 --> 00:28:32,960
On a scale of 1 to 10,
like...

833
00:28:33,199 --> 00:28:34,757
9.5.

834
00:28:35,104 --> 00:28:36,671
Solid 9.5.

835
00:28:36,953 --> 00:28:38,871
That makes...
that makes sense.

836
00:28:38,955 --> 00:28:40,081
You're not thinking
about getting back

837
00:28:40,165 --> 00:28:41,582
on that merry‐go‐round,
are you?

838
00:28:41,666 --> 00:28:43,042
Is this, like,

839
00:28:43,126 --> 00:28:44,877
a "you break it, you bought it"
situation?

840
00:28:44,961 --> 00:28:47,000
Dina, it's not like that.

841
00:28:47,085 --> 00:28:48,377
No, it's just,

842
00:28:48,612 --> 00:28:50,546
once I got out
to California,

843
00:28:50,867 --> 00:28:52,437
everything just felt...

844
00:28:53,305 --> 00:28:55,139
And...

845
00:28:55,513 --> 00:28:57,349
I don't know, I think I...

846
00:28:58,978 --> 00:29:01,132
I think I made a mistake
not marrying Jonah.

847
00:29:01,217 --> 00:29:02,671
Ya think?

848
00:29:05,074 --> 00:29:07,660
I just... I can't anymore.

849
00:29:08,972 --> 00:29:11,062
She's been pretty upset too.

850
00:29:11,442 --> 00:29:12,903
Garrett,
for the contact list,

851
00:29:12,988 --> 00:29:14,864
you wrote email@email.email.

852
00:29:14,949 --> 00:29:15,992
Oh, really?

853
00:29:16,077 --> 00:29:17,704
You too cool to keep in touch
with everybody?

854
00:29:17,788 --> 00:29:19,202
I'm just being
realistic, man.

855
00:29:19,287 --> 00:29:20,218
Look, we work together,

856
00:29:20,303 --> 00:29:21,596
and now we're gonna go work
with other people.

857
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,611
I'd rather skip the part
where we email for a week

858
00:29:23,695 --> 00:29:25,279
trying to plan
some fictional group trip.

859
00:29:25,363 --> 00:29:27,235
But we are doing
a group trip.

860
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,344
It's either gonna be
Kansas City

861
00:29:29,429 --> 00:29:30,493
or Tokyo.

862
00:29:30,577 --> 00:29:32,453
Buddy, we're not making it
to Applebee's,

863
00:29:32,537 --> 00:29:34,288
and we work down the street
from Applebee's.

864
00:29:34,372 --> 00:29:36,332
Ugh, love Applebee's.

865
00:29:36,416 --> 00:29:38,626
Okay, any five.

866
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:40,294
Doesn't matter who.

867
00:29:40,378 --> 00:29:41,754
Let's see.

868
00:29:41,838 --> 00:29:44,382
Here we go.

869
00:29:46,009 --> 00:29:47,802
Oh, oh, God, no.

870
00:29:47,886 --> 00:29:50,471
Nope, not gonna work.
All right.

871
00:29:50,555 --> 00:29:52,515
♪ Hot child in the city ♪

872
00:29:54,768 --> 00:29:57,938
♪ Runnin' wild
and lookin' pretty ♪

873
00:29:59,398 --> 00:30:00,773
Hey.

874
00:30:00,857 --> 00:30:01,983
Hey.

875
00:30:03,402 --> 00:30:06,529
So I've been meaning
to tell you, uh,

876
00:30:06,613 --> 00:30:08,781
"The Americans" is really good.

877
00:30:08,865 --> 00:30:10,825
- You watched it.
- I did.

878
00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:13,536
I mean, I watched
basically everything.

879
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:15,038
You know, pandemic.

880
00:30:15,122 --> 00:30:18,041
I kept wanting
to text you, but...

881
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:21,502
Well, I'm glad you liked it.

882
00:30:21,953 --> 00:30:23,379
And, um...

883
00:30:23,463 --> 00:30:26,299
the other thing that I've
been wanting to tell you

884
00:30:26,554 --> 00:30:28,427
is that I'm sorry.

885
00:30:29,761 --> 00:30:31,484
I'm sorry for the way I left.

886
00:30:31,726 --> 00:30:33,139
It was...

887
00:30:33,223 --> 00:30:35,183
selfish and awful and...

888
00:30:35,267 --> 00:30:37,477
Hey, I... we... I don't...

889
00:30:37,561 --> 00:30:40,146
look, you don't have
to apologize to me

890
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:41,814
for not wanting to marry me.

891
00:30:41,898 --> 00:30:43,066
No!

892
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:44,867
It wasn't even about that.

893
00:30:44,952 --> 00:30:46,798
I just... I think that, like,

894
00:30:46,883 --> 00:30:48,898
my brain short‐circuited.

895
00:30:48,983 --> 00:30:51,073
You know, suddenly I had
all these options

896
00:30:51,158 --> 00:30:52,658
for the first time in my life,
and I was like,

897
00:30:52,742 --> 00:30:54,911
"Yay, I get to decide
what I want,

898
00:30:54,995 --> 00:30:57,246
but wait, like, how do I
decide what I want?"

899
00:30:57,330 --> 00:30:59,499
Yeah, welcome
to the world of privilege.

900
00:30:59,583 --> 00:31:01,542
It's very hard
on this side of things.

901
00:31:01,626 --> 00:31:03,413
Why didn't you warn me?

902
00:31:03,498 --> 00:31:04,415
Don't know.

903
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,713
Look, Jonah,

904
00:31:06,203 --> 00:31:08,429
I didn't know what I wanted,

905
00:31:08,633 --> 00:31:10,398
but I know now, and...

906
00:31:10,483 --> 00:31:13,602
Amy, I'm happy
that you figured it out.

907
00:31:13,687 --> 00:31:15,222
I really, really am.

908
00:31:15,307 --> 00:31:17,703
But I'm not just...

909
00:31:18,755 --> 00:31:20,494
I don't know, I'm not just
something you can schedule

910
00:31:20,578 --> 00:31:22,079
for whenever you're free,
you know?

911
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:24,774
I'm sorry, but I just...

912
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:27,390
I don't know
what I want anymore.

913
00:31:28,593 --> 00:31:29,802
Okay.

914
00:31:33,825 --> 00:31:36,203
Um, if you figure it out...

915
00:31:38,038 --> 00:31:39,515
Let me know.

916
00:31:49,235 --> 00:31:51,712
- Excuse me.
- Um, where would I find nutmeg?

917
00:31:51,797 --> 00:31:53,530
- Nutmeg?
- Well, that's aisle 12,

918
00:31:53,614 --> 00:31:55,157
- right over there.
- Aisle 12.

919
00:31:55,241 --> 00:31:56,283
Okay, thank you so much
for your help.

920
00:31:56,367 --> 00:31:58,202
- You're so welcome.
- Uh...

921
00:31:58,286 --> 00:31:59,912
the coronavirus.

922
00:32:01,455 --> 00:32:02,873
- Okay.
- Have a heavenly day.

923
00:32:02,957 --> 00:32:04,458
Okay, thanks, okay.

924
00:32:04,542 --> 00:32:05,792
You a big spice guy?

925
00:32:05,876 --> 00:32:08,003
That man might be
my last customer ever.

926
00:32:08,087 --> 00:32:09,880
It's so sad.

927
00:32:09,964 --> 00:32:11,507
Yeah, we're all...

928
00:32:11,591 --> 00:32:12,641
I'm gonna miss this.

929
00:32:12,726 --> 00:32:13,727
You know, I thought I had

930
00:32:13,812 --> 00:32:15,802
a few more good years
left in me.

931
00:32:15,886 --> 00:32:17,012
You know, my dad,

932
00:32:17,096 --> 00:32:19,348
he worked at our hardware store
till he was 80.

933
00:32:19,432 --> 00:32:21,016
I thought I'd do
the same, but...

934
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:22,392
it's just so unfair.

935
00:32:22,476 --> 00:32:23,422
Glenn!

936
00:32:23,507 --> 00:32:25,258
If you don't want to retire,
then don't.

937
00:32:25,438 --> 00:32:27,189
No one's making you
stop working.

938
00:32:27,273 --> 00:32:29,195
Hey, Mat...

939
00:32:36,157 --> 00:32:37,741
Hey, everyone!

940
00:32:37,825 --> 00:32:40,281
I'm not gonna retire.

941
00:32:40,366 --> 00:32:43,452
Uh, yeah, I think
I'm gonna get a new job

942
00:32:43,537 --> 00:32:47,081
or maybe even reopen
Sturgis & Sons Hardware,

943
00:32:47,166 --> 00:32:49,419
though I‐I have to check
with Jerusha,

944
00:32:49,503 --> 00:32:51,296
because, you know,
it's a very big commitment.

945
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:53,590
I think it's a great idea!

946
00:32:53,674 --> 00:32:55,217
Hey, guys, good news.

947
00:32:55,414 --> 00:32:57,553
Jerusha's in.

948
00:33:03,309 --> 00:33:04,518
You okay?

949
00:33:05,274 --> 00:33:06,774
Oh.

950
00:33:07,398 --> 00:33:08,897
I'm the new
fulfillment center manager,

951
00:33:08,981 --> 00:33:10,566
but I can only keep
five employees,

952
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:12,776
and I can't make up my mind.

953
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:14,570
When I have
a tough decision to make,

954
00:33:14,654 --> 00:33:16,446
I like to spend a Sunday
on the bus.

955
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:18,407
Pack a little lunch,
and just bus on it.

956
00:33:18,491 --> 00:33:19,575
Ah, Sandra,
I can't get sucked

957
00:33:19,659 --> 00:33:21,076
into your bleak life, okay?

958
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,537
Zephra needs a list now.

959
00:33:24,343 --> 00:33:25,510
Okay.

960
00:33:34,006 --> 00:33:35,383
Done.

961
00:33:37,843 --> 00:33:39,761
Yeah, that's it.

962
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:43,599
Why the "AM" next to your name?

963
00:33:43,683 --> 00:33:45,643
'Cause I'm
your assistant manager.

964
00:33:51,482 --> 00:33:52,441
If that's okay with you.

965
00:33:52,525 --> 00:33:53,442
I don't want to be
presumptuous.

966
00:33:53,526 --> 00:33:54,735
No, you're in.

967
00:33:54,819 --> 00:33:56,111
I was going for, like, a...

968
00:33:56,195 --> 00:33:58,101
cool, badass moment.

969
00:33:58,186 --> 00:33:59,445
- Yeah, I got that.
- Good.

970
00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:01,735
Yeah, you don't need to do...
okay, you did.

971
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:02,659
All right.

972
00:34:02,743 --> 00:34:04,453
This is probably
the last time

973
00:34:04,537 --> 00:34:06,455
I'm ever gonna
clean up slushie vomit.

974
00:34:06,539 --> 00:34:08,624
Oh, can you take a picture?

975
00:34:08,708 --> 00:34:10,292
No. What?

976
00:34:10,376 --> 00:34:11,460
Look, I don't get it.

977
00:34:11,544 --> 00:34:12,836
We work in a big,
dumb, ugly store,

978
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,296
and everybody's acting
like they're Jordan

979
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:16,006
walking off the court
for the last time.

980
00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:17,174
Aw,

981
00:34:17,258 --> 00:34:20,469
your last slushie vomit.

982
00:34:20,553 --> 00:34:22,346
- Come on.
- Look at this.

983
00:34:22,430 --> 00:34:23,930
I was cleaning out my office,
and I found

984
00:34:24,014 --> 00:34:27,309
these old tapes
of everyone's job interviews.

985
00:34:27,393 --> 00:34:29,144
- Ooh.
- Wait, I don't remember...

986
00:34:29,228 --> 00:34:31,188
did you secretly record
our job interviews?

987
00:34:31,272 --> 00:34:32,773
Yeah, but, you know,

988
00:34:32,857 --> 00:34:34,441
just so I'd have proof in case

989
00:34:34,525 --> 00:34:36,276
someone accused me
of not hiring them

990
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,320
unless they did me
sexual favors.

991
00:34:38,404 --> 00:34:40,364
I mean, Pastor Craig
was falsely accused

992
00:34:40,448 --> 00:34:43,534
30 times by women and men.

993
00:34:44,243 --> 00:34:45,660

997
00:34:54,405 --> 00:34:56,945
Jesus seizes cheeses.

998
00:34:57,089 --> 00:34:59,523
I don't know if I've ever
seen her videos.

999
00:34:59,758 --> 00:35:01,343
Hi, you must be Amy.

1000
00:35:01,427 --> 00:35:03,011
- Damn, Amy, you were hot.
- Thank you.

1001
00:35:03,095 --> 00:35:05,389
- Boner alert.
- Dude, she's a teenager.

1002
00:35:05,473 --> 00:35:07,140
Yeah, but I was
a teenager then, too,

1003
00:35:07,224 --> 00:35:08,392
so it's not weird.

1004
00:35:08,476 --> 00:35:09,684
So glad I came back for this.

1005
00:35:09,768 --> 00:35:11,395
- Yeah.
- Um, once you've worked here

1006
00:35:11,479 --> 00:35:13,118
for a year,
it starts to get good.

1007
00:35:13,203 --> 00:35:15,732
Oh, um, thank you so much,
but actually,

1008
00:35:15,816 --> 00:35:17,526
I'm going to college
in the fall,

1009
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:20,320
so I'm only planning
to be here a few months.

1010
00:35:20,404 --> 00:35:22,864
205 months, to be exact.

1011
00:35:22,948 --> 00:35:24,741
Oh, young Amy,

1012
00:35:24,825 --> 00:35:27,244
with your big, big dreams
and your tiny, tiny pores.

1013
00:35:27,328 --> 00:35:29,203
They were so tiny.

1014
00:35:29,288 --> 00:35:30,830
- Sorry.
- No, please, go ahead.

1015
00:35:30,915 --> 00:35:33,041
Oh, my God.

1016
00:35:33,125 --> 00:35:34,376
You worked
at The Spaghetti Factory?

1017
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:36,086
I go there all the time.

1018
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:37,921
Wait a minute, I know you.

1019
00:35:38,005 --> 00:35:40,382
Fettuccine Alfredo,
side of grilled cheese,

1020
00:35:40,466 --> 00:35:41,842
three glasses of juice.

1021
00:35:41,926 --> 00:35:43,718
That's incredible. Yeah.

1022
00:35:43,802 --> 00:35:45,929
Aw, you guys used
to get along.

1023
00:35:46,013 --> 00:35:47,728
I also worked in the bird
department at Petco.

1024
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:48,695
Oh.

1025
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,556
God, you know,
I don't get how people

1026
00:35:50,641 --> 00:35:51,908
can keep birds as pets.

1027
00:35:51,993 --> 00:35:53,395
They're disgusting.

1028
00:35:53,479 --> 00:35:56,064
- Rats with feathers.
- Uh‐huh.

1029
00:35:56,148 --> 00:35:57,399
Let's move on.

1030
00:35:57,483 --> 00:35:58,860
Okay, well, um...

1031
00:35:58,945 --> 00:36:00,572
Hey, here's what you need
to know about Garrett McNeill.

1032
00:36:02,242 --> 00:36:03,493
Oh, my God.

1033
00:36:03,656 --> 00:36:04,891
That guy's handsome.

1034
00:36:04,977 --> 00:36:06,575
Am I hard on myself?

1035
00:36:06,714 --> 00:36:07,881
Sure,

1036
00:36:08,202 --> 00:36:10,245
but I call it
taking the job seriously.

1037
00:36:10,329 --> 00:36:11,580
- Wow.
- What?

1038
00:36:11,664 --> 00:36:13,707
- I give a good interview.
- What can I say?

1039
00:36:13,791 --> 00:36:16,084
Why do you want
to work at Cloud 9?

1040
00:36:16,168 --> 00:36:19,171
Um, actually,
I already work here.

1041
00:36:19,255 --> 00:36:20,630
You hired me two weeks ago.

1042
00:36:20,714 --> 00:36:22,329
I don't think so.

1043
00:36:22,414 --> 00:36:23,927
I think I'd remember that.

1044
00:36:26,099 --> 00:36:27,475
You gave me one of these.

1045
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,644
I'm so sorry.

1046
00:36:28,729 --> 00:36:29,763
It's just that you've got

1047
00:36:29,848 --> 00:36:32,025
such a forgettable face,
you know?

1048
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:33,289
- I know.
- I think you'd make

1049
00:36:33,374 --> 00:36:34,938
a great spy, though.

1050
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:37,018
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1051
00:36:37,103 --> 00:36:38,896

And so we were in line
at Claire's...

1056
00:36:48,867 --> 00:36:50,160
- Oh, my goodness.
- Oh!

1057
00:36:50,244 --> 00:36:52,621
My purple hair thingy.

1058
00:36:52,705 --> 00:36:53,955
Corona was like,
"You eat it."

1059
00:36:54,039 --> 00:36:56,249
And I was like,
"Nah, girl, that is narsty."

1060
00:36:56,333 --> 00:36:57,459
You eat it."

1061
00:36:57,543 --> 00:36:58,460
And that,
ladies and gentlemen,

1062
00:36:58,544 --> 00:37:00,462
is our current
floor supervisor.

1063
00:37:00,546 --> 00:37:02,839
- I know, right?
- Life is nuts.

1064
00:37:02,923 --> 00:37:04,841
I don't know
if I should say anything,

1065
00:37:04,925 --> 00:37:07,414
but there's a Scott Baio
wannabe waiting outside,

1066
00:37:07,499 --> 00:37:09,361
and I heard him tell his meth dealer
that he just

1067
00:37:09,445 --> 00:37:11,515
<i>- wants to rob the place.</i>
- Hey, um, when the store closes,

1068
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:14,643
do you want to...
keep hangin' and bangin',

1069
00:37:14,727 --> 00:37:16,313
like, as my boyfriend?

1070
00:37:17,403 --> 00:37:18,695
Yeah.

1071
00:37:18,897 --> 00:37:21,483
- Yeah.
- Okay. Cool.

1072
00:37:21,567 --> 00:37:22,651
Tell me more about you.

1073
00:37:22,735 --> 00:37:23,985
I just want to say

1074
00:37:24,069 --> 00:37:25,612
that if you give me
the chance,

1075
00:37:25,696 --> 00:37:27,113
I will work harder

1076
00:37:27,197 --> 00:37:28,448
than anyone you know.

1077
00:37:28,532 --> 00:37:30,617
I will literally
dig through concrete

1078
00:37:30,701 --> 00:37:31,785
with my bare hands

1079
00:37:31,869 --> 00:37:33,036
until they're bloody stumps

1080
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,788
and I have to do stuff
with my feet.

1081
00:37:34,872 --> 00:37:36,837
You know,
I could use a hard worker

1082
00:37:36,922 --> 00:37:39,042
like that
at Sturgis & Sons.

1083
00:37:40,586 --> 00:37:42,016
Really?

1084
00:37:44,757 --> 00:37:46,110
Thank you.

1085
00:37:48,737 --> 00:37:50,863
Should we do, like,
denim or leather aprons?

1086
00:37:50,971 --> 00:37:52,514
Denim, right,
like, a raw denim?

1087
00:37:52,598 --> 00:37:54,391
Okay. I love it.
I love it.

1088
00:37:54,475 --> 00:37:56,219
It's more my color.

1089
00:38:00,852 --> 00:38:02,312
Jonah Simms.

1090
00:38:02,396 --> 00:38:05,165
Wow, you have had
a lot of jobs.

1091
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:07,594
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I worked at a consulting firm

1092
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:08,743
for a few months

1093
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:10,912
and then an ad agency
for six weeks.

1094
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:12,081
I sold gym memberships.

1095
00:38:12,166 --> 00:38:13,876
I was a barista,
a tour guide.

1096
00:38:13,961 --> 00:38:15,561
I went to business school
for a semester,

1097
00:38:15,665 --> 00:38:18,292
but now I'm just at a place
in my life

1098
00:38:18,376 --> 00:38:19,960
where I really want to change.

1099
00:38:20,044 --> 00:38:22,000
You know, I just want
to spend a couple months

1100
00:38:22,085 --> 00:38:23,962
just not using my brain.

1101
00:38:24,047 --> 00:38:25,339
- Whoa!
- Boo!

1102
00:38:25,424 --> 00:38:27,134
- All right, yeah, I know.
- I get it. I know.

1103
00:38:27,218 --> 00:38:28,761
I can't listen
to myself either,

1104
00:38:28,845 --> 00:38:29,762
so enjoy.

1105
00:38:29,846 --> 00:38:31,597
All right, all right.

1106
00:38:31,681 --> 00:38:32,994
- Use your brain?
- No, no, I mean,

1107
00:38:33,078 --> 00:38:33,938
it's not just that.

1108
00:38:34,023 --> 00:38:35,733
It's... you know,

1109
00:38:35,894 --> 00:38:37,770
when you think about it,
a store like this

1110
00:38:37,854 --> 00:38:39,814
is actually pretty incredible,
you know?

1111
00:38:39,898 --> 00:38:41,357
You help people
do their homework

1112
00:38:41,441 --> 00:38:43,317
and find their styles

1113
00:38:43,401 --> 00:38:44,652
and feed
their grandchildren.

1114
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:48,125
You know,
there's magic in that.

1115
00:38:48,364 --> 00:38:50,993
I don't know, people always
talk about going out

1116
00:38:51,141 --> 00:38:52,594
and finding something special,

1117
00:38:52,679 --> 00:38:55,884
but, you know, maybe we don't
have to look that hard.

1118
00:38:55,969 --> 00:38:58,708
You know, maybe everything
is special.

1119
00:39:02,128 --> 00:39:04,046
How many jobs have you had?

1120
00:39:04,131 --> 00:39:05,259
What?

1121
00:39:05,344 --> 00:39:07,762
Not including paper routes
and babysitting or whatever,

1122
00:39:07,847 --> 00:39:09,348
how many actual jobs?

1123
00:39:09,433 --> 00:39:11,768
- Too many to count.
- 20, 30?

1124
00:39:11,884 --> 00:39:14,929
Yeah, you never
stick with anything.

1125
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:17,016
Except this.

1126
00:39:17,106 --> 00:39:19,686
You've been here six years.
Why?

1127
00:39:19,771 --> 00:39:22,356
- I don't know.
- It's a good job.

1128
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,191
- No, it's not.
- It's a terrible job.

1129
00:39:24,275 --> 00:39:25,548
- It's not that bad.
- Jonah,

1130
00:39:25,633 --> 00:39:27,194
why did you stay here?

1131
00:39:27,278 --> 00:39:28,868
Why do you think, Amy?

1132
00:39:33,438 --> 00:39:35,766
You know,
when I first met you,

1133
00:39:36,107 --> 00:39:39,569
I thought you were the most
annoying person I'd ever met,

1134
00:39:39,654 --> 00:39:41,405
with your "moments of beauty,"

1135
00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:43,533
"seize the day" crap

1136
00:39:43,618 --> 00:39:45,689
like you'd watched
"Dead Poets Society"

1137
00:39:45,774 --> 00:39:47,813
- too many times.
- Shows what you know.

1138
00:39:47,966 --> 00:39:49,050
You can't watch
"Dead Poets Society"

1139
00:39:49,134 --> 00:39:49,883
too many times.

1140
00:39:49,968 --> 00:39:51,426
I hated how cheesy you were.

1141
00:39:51,511 --> 00:39:53,554
I hated how woke you were.

1142
00:39:53,638 --> 00:39:55,556
I hated how often
you used the word "artisan."

1143
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:58,059
But most of all,
I hated how you believed

1144
00:39:58,143 --> 00:40:00,297
that life could be
better than it was.

1145
00:40:01,657 --> 00:40:03,409
And yet here we are.

1146
00:40:05,191 --> 00:40:09,532
And my life is so much better
than it was...

1147
00:40:10,542 --> 00:40:11,835
because of you.

1148
00:40:12,438 --> 00:40:13,571
And I...

1149
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:15,218
I screwed it all up.

1150
00:40:15,303 --> 00:40:16,387
I know that.

1151
00:40:18,454 --> 00:40:20,305
But you waited
six years for me,

1152
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:22,100
so if I have to wait an...

1153
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:34,039
I'm sorry, it's just,
you were talking so much.

1154
00:40:34,204 --> 00:40:35,622
I didn't know what to do.

1155
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:39,274
Excuse me. Hi.

1156
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:40,651
Does the "cup"
in "menstrual cup"

1157
00:40:40,735 --> 00:40:42,269
refer to, like, the shape

1158
00:40:42,353 --> 00:40:43,813
or the volume?

1159
00:40:46,263 --> 00:40:47,639
Have to say,

1160
00:40:47,724 --> 00:40:49,235
I always thought when they
shut this place down,

1161
00:40:49,319 --> 00:40:51,070
it would be because
of something you did.

1162
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:54,449
Me too.

1163
00:40:55,098 --> 00:40:56,223
Hey.

1164
00:40:56,377 --> 00:40:58,463
Take care of the old gal,
will you?

1165
00:40:59,815 --> 00:41:01,063
I will.

1166
00:41:02,396 --> 00:41:03,689
Attention, shoppers.

1167
00:41:03,774 --> 00:41:05,750
Please bring your final
purchases up to checkout,

1168
00:41:05,835 --> 00:41:08,500
'cause this store
is about to close forever.

1169
00:41:08,585 --> 00:41:10,461
On behalf of everyone
here at Cloud 9,

1170
00:41:10,546 --> 00:41:12,006
I'd just like to say...

1171
00:41:12,107 --> 00:41:13,399
buh‐bye.

1172
00:41:21,062 --> 00:41:24,481
Sorry, that shouldn't be
the last thing I say.

1173
00:41:24,712 --> 00:41:27,618
20... years
of announcements.

1174
00:41:27,781 --> 00:41:29,806
I mean, I'm not
a sentimental guy.

1175
00:41:29,891 --> 00:41:31,651
That's not my thing.

1176
00:41:31,736 --> 00:41:35,114
But it did just occur to me
that this is...

1177
00:41:35,198 --> 00:41:36,323
this is the end.

1178
00:41:36,477 --> 00:41:39,011
I mean, don't get me wrong.
It's a job.

1179
00:41:39,274 --> 00:41:41,211
If jobs were fun,
they wouldn't pay us to do it.

1180
00:41:41,296 --> 00:41:44,757
But occasionally there were
moments that...

1181
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:46,610
weren't so bad.

1182
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,032
And for whatever reason,

1183
00:41:49,126 --> 00:41:50,710
those are...

1184
00:41:50,934 --> 00:41:53,311
the only things
I can remember right now.

1185
00:41:53,396 --> 00:41:54,814
You know, most jobs suck

1186
00:41:54,899 --> 00:41:57,883
99% of the time.

1187
00:41:58,038 --> 00:41:59,831
So you really...

1188
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:02,456
really gotta enjoy
those moments that don't...

1189
00:42:02,595 --> 00:42:04,138
Are we Sturgis & Friends?

1190
00:42:04,223 --> 00:42:05,344
- No!
- No!

1191
00:42:05,429 --> 00:42:07,625
Those bits of fun you have
during downtime...

1192
00:42:07,772 --> 00:42:09,096
- Are we Sturgis & Sons?
- Yes! - Yes!

1193
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:10,306
All right, let's get to work.

1194
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:11,525
Or an interesting
conversation

1195
00:42:11,609 --> 00:42:12,568
with a coworker...

1196
00:42:12,652 --> 00:42:15,430
- For the lab.
- Boom!

1197
00:42:15,605 --> 00:42:16,731
Or something happens

1198
00:42:16,816 --> 00:42:18,400
that you can
laugh about later...

1199
00:42:18,485 --> 00:42:20,195
Oh, that's a picture
of my honeymoon.

1200
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,405
Sorry about that.

1201
00:42:21,619 --> 00:42:23,037
Or you do something

1202
00:42:23,125 --> 00:42:24,705
that you're actually proud of.

1203
00:42:24,789 --> 00:42:26,930
- Looking great, guys.
- Keep up the good work.

1204
00:42:27,097 --> 00:42:29,209
If you're lucky, maybe you
even get to be friends

1205
00:42:29,294 --> 00:42:31,253
with a coworker or two
along the way.

1206
00:42:33,991 --> 00:42:36,266
Not sure what else
you could want in a job.

1207
00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:41,222
- How did you do this?
- With my mouth!

1208
00:42:43,766 --> 00:42:46,060
- Oh, my God. Look at that.
- I know.

1209
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:02,250
Love you.

1210
00:43:03,161 --> 00:43:04,578
- They're asleep.
- Both of them?

1211
00:43:04,662 --> 00:43:06,205
- Yeah.
- Nice.

1212
00:43:18,509 --> 00:43:20,516
At any rate...

1213
00:43:21,347 --> 00:43:23,164
thank you for shopping with us.

1214
00:43:23,706 --> 00:43:26,118
