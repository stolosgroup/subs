<i>PAUL ON TV Good afternoon,</i>
<i>this is Paul Gerard,</i>

2
00:00:07,054 --> 00:00:09,682
<i>and once again,</i>
<i>the world is my kitchen,</i>

3
00:00:09,956 --> 00:00:14,017
<i>a world of fine dining</i>
<i>in the restaurant</i>
<i>and in your home</i>

00:00:14,294 --> 00:00:18,230

<i>meals are prepared</i>
<i>for the eye,</i>

5
00:00:18,298 --> 00:00:19,788
<i>as well as the palate</i>

6
00:00:20,033 --> 00:00:22,593
<i>This is not true, however,</i>
<i>of an eating ritual</i>

00:00:22,669 --> 00:00:26,867
<i>known as</i> Odori,
<i>the dance of the flesh</i>

8
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:31,377
<i>In a country</i>
<i>where most people like</i>
<i>their seafood fresh and raw,</i>

9
00:00:31,445 --> 00:00:33,606
<i>there are those</i>
<i>who prefer it lively</i>

11

<i>and eaten with gusto</i>

12
00:00:40,087 --> 00:00:43,750
You can never say
he allows himself
to be blinded by good taste

13
00:00:43,824 --> 00:00:45,257
Only by money

14
00:00:45,325 --> 00:00:47,316
Still, he's done
all right for us

<i>considered to be</i>
<i>the most delicious variety,</i>

19

20
00:01:02,376 --> 00:01:04,435
<i>a remarkably potent poison</i>

21
00:01:04,511 --> 00:01:07,708
<i>unless the highly toxic liver</i>
<i>and other organs</i>

Paul, we need a couple
with just the package, now

31
00:01:28,235 --> 00:01:32,296
Life would be unbearable
without my daily portion
of Bon Snax

32
00:01:32,372 --> 00:01:33,396

33
00:01:33,473 --> 00:01:35,873
Yes, yes,
my anchovies would weep

34
00:01:35,942 --> 00:01:38,376
and my <i>patי</i> would be desolate

35
00:01:38,779 --> 00:01:41,976
and my Camembert inconsolable

36
00:01:42,649 --> 00:01:44,139
Am I breaking
your heart, Charlie?

37
00:01:44,217 --> 00:01:45,650
CHARLIE: Keep it up,
you're doing great

38
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:47,653
How many more, fellas?
Oh, just one more, please

39
00:01:47,721 --> 00:01:49,484
Always just one more

40
00:01:49,556 --> 00:01:51,615
If you gave a photographer
20 lashes,

41
00:01:51,691 --> 00:01:53,682
he'd still ask
for just one more

42

Paul, can I ask you
a question?

58
00:02:35,735 --> 00:02:36,827
Certainly

59
00:02:40,874 --> 00:02:42,671
Are we having an affair?

60
00:02:43,243 --> 00:02:46,474
I would say
a prelude to an affair

No ill effects

162
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:06,265
And then you came
directly here, sir?

163
00:12:06,339 --> 00:12:07,533
Yes, I

164
00:12:08,508 --> 00:12:11,602
You said
Albert cooked that?

165
00:12:12,045 --> 00:12:15,606
Delicious and it's all
in the basil and the garlic

166
00:12:19,619 --> 00:12:22,019
Oh, I see
what you mean, sir

167
00:12:22,255 --> 00:12:23,813
Albert, the poison

168
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:26,188
Oh, I doubt that
very much, sir

169
00:12:26,392 --> 00:12:29,452
When we brought him
in to question him,
he became very indignant

170
00:12:29,529 --> 00:12:32,965
He grabbed a knife and fork,
he started to eat
everything in sight

171
00:12:33,132 --> 00:12:35,259
He's in perfect health, sir

172
00:12:35,401 --> 00:12:36,993
And the boy? Mario?

173
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:40,267
As I understand it,
he didn't eat

174
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:44,605
I wonder why the mussels
that you buy in the store

175
00:12:44,677 --> 00:12:46,577
never turn out this way

176
00:12:47,313 --> 00:12:49,907
Oh, I do a little cooking,
sir, nothing fancy

177
00:12:50,116 --> 00:12:51,413
Mrs Columbo,

178
00:12:52,418 --> 00:12:56,081
she's a remarkable woman
She has lots of interests

179
00:12:56,622 --> 00:12:58,556
But cooking
isn't one of them

180
00:12:58,624 --> 00:13:01,149
She gives me plenty
of encouragement

181
00:13:02,428 --> 00:13:03,622
Feeling better, sir?

182
00:13:03,696 --> 00:13:04,924
Yes, yes, thank you

183
00:13:05,264 --> 00:13:07,664
Well, what I was
going to ask you, sir,

184
00:13:09,035 --> 00:13:10,502
didn't the

185
00:13:12,705 --> 00:13:14,605
Did you say you went
to the airport tonight?

186
00:13:14,674 --> 00:13:16,767
Yes, to meet a friend

187
00:13:16,843 --> 00:13:18,174
And then you came right here?

188
00:13:18,244 --> 00:13:19,472
No, Lieutenant,

189
00:13:19,545 --> 00:13:23,413
the call from the police
didn't reach me
until I returned home

190
00:13:23,783 --> 00:13:26,013
And how long
would you say it took you

191
00:13:26,085 --> 00:13:27,814
to get from your home
to here?

192
00:13:27,887 --> 00:13:29,514
I came immediately

193
00:13:29,722 --> 00:13:32,156
From the phone call
to my arrival,

194
00:13:32,225 --> 00:13:35,490
about eight minutes
Is this important, Lieutenant?

195
00:13:35,561 --> 00:13:38,553
Not at all, sir
Just for my report

196
00:13:39,265 --> 00:13:41,028
What I wanted to ask you,

197
00:13:42,401 --> 00:13:45,461
did the victim show any signs
of being in trouble?

198
00:13:45,872 --> 00:13:48,033
No Certainly nothing
like that

199
00:13:48,107 --> 00:13:49,768
Are you sure, sir?

200
00:13:50,009 --> 00:13:52,034
Nothing you
might have forgotten?

201
00:13:52,111 --> 00:13:55,342
Lord knows you'd be entitled
if something slipped
your mind

202
00:13:55,414 --> 00:13:57,143
All this stress,

203
00:13:57,683 --> 00:14:00,208
all this poison flying around

204
00:14:00,419 --> 00:14:05,049
What makes you think Vittorio
was in some sort of trouble?

205
00:14:05,925 --> 00:14:08,416
Mainly because
he was murdered, sir

206
00:14:08,594 --> 00:14:11,256
The two, trouble and murder,
they seem to go together

207
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:13,855
At least that's been
my experience, sir

208
00:14:15,535 --> 00:14:16,934
Lieutenant

209
00:14:17,003 --> 00:14:20,962
Albert,
can all this be true?

210
00:14:22,608 --> 00:14:24,075
Mr Gerard,

211
00:14:25,111 --> 00:14:27,079
Vittorio was a fine man

212
00:14:28,014 --> 00:14:30,608
You're a food critic,
a great critic

213
00:14:31,617 --> 00:14:33,744
I'm a simple chef,

214
00:14:34,353 --> 00:14:37,720
but I'm sure I speak
for chefs everywhere

215
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:41,282
when I say
I wish it was you
dead in there

216
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,520
Oh, Albert

217
00:14:43,362 --> 00:14:47,822
Lieutenant, the boy, Mario,
you can speak to him now

218
00:14:48,834 --> 00:14:51,803
I'm going home
to finish getting drunk

219
00:14:53,773 --> 00:14:55,331
Thank you, Albert

220
00:14:56,275 --> 00:14:58,140
We'll be in touch, Albert

221
00:14:58,244 --> 00:15:01,145
Poor man He's overwrought

222
00:15:02,114 --> 00:15:04,605
Well, I guess
we're all overwrought

223
00:15:04,884 --> 00:15:06,784
May I help with Mario?

224
00:15:07,253 --> 00:15:08,550
Certainly

225
00:15:09,121 --> 00:15:12,181
You want to hear
a coincidence, Mr Gerard?

226
00:15:12,358 --> 00:15:15,191
I was listening
to your program
on my car radio

227
00:15:15,261 --> 00:15:18,890
one day last week,
and I go through
this tunnel

228
00:15:19,332 --> 00:15:23,200
and I missed the end
of a terrific recipe
on some kind of sauce

229
00:15:24,437 --> 00:15:26,166
Do you remember
the name of that?

230
00:15:26,239 --> 00:15:28,104
Could it be bיchamel?

231
00:15:29,308 --> 00:15:32,072
No This is something
I'm gonna spring
on Mrs Columbo

232
00:15:32,178 --> 00:15:33,941
Rיmoulade? Hollandaise?

233
00:15:34,981 --> 00:15:36,881
I'm gonna think of it
in a minute

234
00:15:36,949 --> 00:15:39,440
It's some kind of
a French name

235
00:15:46,726 --> 00:15:50,162
May I ask
who called the police?

236
00:15:50,429 --> 00:15:52,158
He did, sir Mario

237
00:15:53,332 --> 00:15:54,993
(SPEAKING ITALIAN)

238
00:15:56,535 --> 00:15:58,901
But he doesn't speak
a word of English

239
00:15:58,971 --> 00:16:00,404
Well, he's a very
bright boy, sir

240
00:16:00,473 --> 00:16:04,102
As Sergeant Burke
understands it, he called
his mother in Genoa

241
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:07,907
and she called the police
here long distance

242
00:16:08,714 --> 00:16:10,079
Genoa

243
00:16:11,117 --> 00:16:12,709
He's remarkable

244
00:16:13,119 --> 00:16:14,780
(SPEAKING ITALIAN)

245
00:16:14,987 --> 00:16:16,921
(SPEAKING ITALIAN)

246
00:16:17,256 --> 00:16:19,121
As I understand it, sir,

247
00:16:19,225 --> 00:16:21,591
you left without
finishing your dinner

248
00:16:21,661 --> 00:16:23,822
Yes, fortunately

249
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:27,593
And before the victim
showed any effects
from the poison

250
00:16:27,667 --> 00:16:29,134
Well, yes

251
00:16:29,402 --> 00:16:31,495
I'll just question
the witness

252
00:16:37,243 --> 00:16:39,234
(SPEAKING ITALIAN)

253
00:17:23,622 --> 00:17:25,988
Calm Calm

254
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:28,724
(COLUMBO SPEAKING ITALIAN)

255
00:17:39,338 --> 00:17:42,205
He says
he loved his uncle
I believe him

256
00:17:42,842 --> 00:17:44,969
Why would he
kill his uncle?

257
00:17:48,447 --> 00:17:50,278
What else did he say?

258
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:54,709
He said his uncle
was very angry
Slamming drawers

259
00:18:02,495 --> 00:18:04,622
Why would he be
slamming drawers?

260
00:18:04,697 --> 00:18:07,325
I mean, why would
he even open drawers?

261
00:18:07,867 --> 00:18:09,698
He put the tray there

262
00:18:11,103 --> 00:18:13,469
Nothing has been put away

263
00:18:15,107 --> 00:18:17,166
Why would he open drawers?

264
00:18:21,347 --> 00:18:23,281
Have to think about that

265
00:18:23,349 --> 00:18:26,011
Look at those beautiful pots

266
00:18:30,589 --> 00:18:34,047
The boy said something
about an argument
and a lot of shouting

267
00:18:34,427 --> 00:18:37,396
What was that about, sir?
It was a trivial matter

268
00:18:37,463 --> 00:18:40,398
Yes, sir
Most arguments seem
to start that way

269
00:18:40,466 --> 00:18:44,493
Every year
the restaurant writers
have an awards dinner

270
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:49,036
For the past three years
we've held it here,
at Vittorio's

271
00:18:49,108 --> 00:18:53,272
This year the committee
decided to have the dinner
at Chez Duvall

272
00:18:53,345 --> 00:18:55,836
Vittorio saw it as a slight,
an insult

273
00:18:55,915 --> 00:18:58,509
I'm on the committee
and he accused me

274
00:18:58,584 --> 00:19:03,146
of suggesting the change,
of influencing their choice

275
00:19:04,223 --> 00:19:05,520
Did you do that, sir?

276
00:19:05,591 --> 00:19:06,990
Yes, sir

277
00:19:07,593 --> 00:19:10,824
In all honesty,
I must confess that I did

278
00:19:12,731 --> 00:19:15,359
Mr Gerard,
I want to thank you
for your help

279
00:19:15,801 --> 00:19:18,099
Oh, I'm pleased
to do what I can

280
00:19:18,504 --> 00:19:21,064
Oh, there's just
one other thing

281
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:23,472
The victim's
appointment book

282
00:19:24,376 --> 00:19:27,106
He had you down
for dinner at 8:00

283
00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:28,168
Yes

284
00:19:28,247 --> 00:19:30,579
And the entry before that

285
00:19:30,783 --> 00:19:32,648
at 4:00

286
00:19:33,786 --> 00:19:37,051
was for a meeting
with an M Choy
and an M Duvall

287
00:19:37,122 --> 00:19:38,987
Do those names
mean anything to you, sir?

288
00:19:39,091 --> 00:19:42,492
M Choy would be Mary Choy,
She owns the House of Choy

289
00:19:42,561 --> 00:19:44,222
And M Duvall?
Who would that be?

290
00:19:44,296 --> 00:19:46,457
Max Duvall,
the owner of Chez Duvall

291
00:19:46,532 --> 00:19:47,794
Vittorio knew them both

292
00:19:47,867 --> 00:19:51,064
But I don't see
how this meeting could be
of any importance

293
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:54,671
Well, it probably isn't, sir,
but Vittorio thought it was

294
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:56,765
He has the entry
heavily outlined

295
00:19:56,842 --> 00:19:59,504
with four exclamation points
after it

296
00:20:00,312 --> 00:20:03,247
That's odd
Well, what's even odder

297
00:20:03,549 --> 00:20:06,074
is he did the same thing
with your name

298
00:20:08,787 --> 00:20:10,812
And he drew a circle
and an arrow

299
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:12,118
PAUL: That's bizarre

300
00:20:12,191 --> 00:20:14,056
Linking your name
to theirs

301
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:15,387
That's pretty bizarre

302
00:20:15,461 --> 00:20:17,224
Do you know, sir,
any reason

303
00:20:17,296 --> 00:20:19,264
that he might have
marked his book that way?

304
00:20:19,331 --> 00:20:20,889
No None

305
00:20:21,233 --> 00:20:23,428
I must say
it's very strange

306
00:20:23,802 --> 00:20:26,236
Lieutenant, it's very late

307
00:20:26,338 --> 00:20:29,899
It's been a harrowing day
Good night

308
00:20:38,851 --> 00:20:42,719
Sorry, Mr Gerard,
but I can't let you
get away with it

309
00:20:42,988 --> 00:20:44,250
What?

310
00:20:44,657 --> 00:20:48,855
Your recipe
You didn't think
I'd remember, did you?

311
00:20:48,928 --> 00:20:50,987
It's onion sauce

312
00:20:52,498 --> 00:20:55,524
Then it was Soubise
Sauce Soubise

313
00:20:55,601 --> 00:20:57,296
It's a simple recipe
I'll get it for you

314
00:20:57,369 --> 00:20:59,803
I'd certainly
appreciate that, sir

315
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,967
Good night, sir

316
00:21:04,443 --> 00:21:05,569
Good night

317
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:26,828
MAX: Nobody lives forever,
but poison?

318
00:21:26,899 --> 00:21:29,925
Who can figure poison?
Who could imagine
a thing like that?

319
00:21:30,069 --> 00:21:31,593
Vittorio Rossi

320
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:35,231
We were apprentices together
Hotel school, Switzerland,
just boys

321
00:21:35,307 --> 00:21:37,867
As I understand it, sir,
you had a meeting
with him yesterday,

322
00:21:37,943 --> 00:21:39,638
and I was wondering

323
00:21:42,247 --> 00:21:43,976
Is that what I think it is?

324
00:21:44,049 --> 00:21:45,744
Is that galantine of duck?

325
00:21:45,818 --> 00:21:47,786
Yeah, this is my galantine

326
00:21:47,853 --> 00:21:49,980
You know,
I've read about these
in a cookbook,

327
00:21:50,055 --> 00:21:52,489
but I have never
actually seen one

328
00:21:52,691 --> 00:21:55,285
And those black buttons,
are they real truffles?

329
00:21:55,361 --> 00:21:56,760
Why, of course

330
00:21:56,829 --> 00:22:00,162
And the green mosaics here,
pistachios

331
00:22:00,399 --> 00:22:02,196
And there's another
kind of meat there, inside

332
00:22:02,267 --> 00:22:03,791
Mmmhmm Ham

333
00:22:03,869 --> 00:22:05,837
It's a real
work of art, sir

334
00:22:07,573 --> 00:22:09,632
What I wanted to ask you,

335
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:13,075
you had a meeting
with Mr Rossi
at 4:00 yesterday

336
00:22:13,145 --> 00:22:14,908
Can you tell me
what that was about?

337
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:18,973
Well, it was social
Cocktails, shop talk,
gossip among old friends

338
00:22:21,053 --> 00:22:23,886
Since you were
one of the last few people
to see him alive,

339
00:22:23,956 --> 00:22:25,287
can you

340
00:22:26,725 --> 00:22:28,625
Do you suppose

341
00:22:30,095 --> 00:22:32,029
Could I try to do that?

342
00:22:32,898 --> 00:22:34,923
This? <i>Oeufs en Gelיe?</i>

343
00:22:35,834 --> 00:22:37,631
Eggs in aspic

344
00:22:37,703 --> 00:22:40,035
I'd really like
to try to get the feel

345
00:22:40,305 --> 00:22:42,773
The way you garnish
a dish like this

346
00:22:42,841 --> 00:22:44,502
Yes, go right ahead

347
00:22:44,576 --> 00:22:46,271
Thank you very much

348
00:22:47,913 --> 00:22:49,574
What I wanted
to ask you, sir,

349
00:22:49,648 --> 00:22:52,446
it has to do with
the victim's frame of mind

350
00:22:52,518 --> 00:22:57,421
Lieutenant Columbo,
I am Louis, the chef

351
00:22:57,823 --> 00:22:59,654
Well, it's a very
great pleasure, sir

352
00:22:59,925 --> 00:23:02,894
Vittorio was my friend
I wish you luck

353
00:23:02,995 --> 00:23:06,260
And I've prepared
a little something for you

354
00:23:08,767 --> 00:23:10,098
Stuffed mushrooms

355
00:23:10,169 --> 00:23:13,161
<i>Champignons farcis au crabe</i>

356
00:23:14,506 --> 00:23:17,031
Are those made
with a bיchamel sauce?

357
00:23:17,109 --> 00:23:18,371
Exactly

358
00:23:18,444 --> 00:23:21,470
Well, I'm going to
enjoy this very much

359
00:23:21,547 --> 00:23:23,708
<i>Merci, monsieur</i>
Thank you, sir

360
00:23:23,782 --> 00:23:25,272
(SPEAKING FRENCH)

361
00:23:32,491 --> 00:23:34,356
We all loved Vittorio

362
00:23:34,426 --> 00:23:36,519
We'll miss him, Lieutenant

363
00:23:38,097 --> 00:23:39,621
Tell me something

364
00:23:39,765 --> 00:23:41,824
In your last meeting
with Vittorio,

365
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,868
did he express any fears?

366
00:23:44,269 --> 00:23:46,464
Did he mention anything
about a death threat?

367
00:23:46,538 --> 00:23:48,369
No, not a thing In fact,

368
00:23:48,674 --> 00:23:52,235
I found him preoccupied,
withdrawn

369
00:23:52,311 --> 00:23:54,279
He was strangely silent

370
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:56,379
A lot on his mind?

371
00:23:56,448 --> 00:24:00,441
It was all
bottled up inside,
ready to explode

372
00:24:00,853 --> 00:24:04,050
No, there was nothing
to suggest that he was
a potential victim

373
00:24:04,123 --> 00:24:06,614
On the contrary,
he seemed like a man

374
00:24:06,692 --> 00:24:09,217
about ready to commit
murder himself

375
00:24:11,029 --> 00:24:13,725
And you got all that
through his silence?

376
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,969
You're a very
perceptive man, Mr Duvall

377
00:24:37,222 --> 00:24:41,056
WAITER: Would you care for
some chartreuse, Mr Gerard?
Thank you Light lunch today

378
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,434
Well, this is
quite a coincidence

379
00:24:50,502 --> 00:24:52,470
I had no idea
you were here

380
00:24:52,538 --> 00:24:53,732
Would you care to join me?

381
00:24:53,806 --> 00:24:55,171
Well,
I'm really not hungry, sir

382
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:58,801
I just polished off
three mushrooms
stuffed with crabmeat

383
00:24:59,378 --> 00:25:01,175
But I'll join you anyway

384
00:25:01,246 --> 00:25:04,807
If you're anything like me,
you're not too crazy
about eating alone

385
00:25:04,883 --> 00:25:08,580
I'm beginning to regard you
as an old acquaintance,
Lieutenant

386
00:25:08,654 --> 00:25:10,144
Well, thank you
very much, sir

387
00:25:10,222 --> 00:25:12,816
I'm beginning to know you
pretty well, too

388
00:25:13,292 --> 00:25:15,192
Would you care
for some champagne?

389
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,750
No, thank you

390
00:25:17,696 --> 00:25:20,529
I know you're going to be
very glad to hear this, sir

391
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:24,469
I got the poison report
back from the lab

392
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:27,068
They still don't know
what kind of poison it was

393
00:25:27,139 --> 00:25:29,004
that killed
your friend Vittorio,

394
00:25:30,209 --> 00:25:33,178
but they found out
it wasn't in the food

395
00:25:35,614 --> 00:25:37,343
It was in the wine

396
00:25:38,951 --> 00:25:40,418
The wine?

397
00:25:40,786 --> 00:25:42,583
That's extraordinary

398
00:25:43,155 --> 00:25:47,592
Why should I be glad
to hear that the poison
was in the wine?

399
00:25:47,826 --> 00:25:48,952
Well, don't you see, sir?

400
00:25:49,027 --> 00:25:52,258
That immediately strikes you
right off my list of suspects

401
00:25:52,331 --> 00:25:56,267
According to the boy,
Vittorio didn't even open
the bottle

402
00:25:56,335 --> 00:25:57,632
until after you left

403
00:25:57,703 --> 00:26:01,571
I wasn't aware that I was
on your list of suspects,
Lieutenant

404
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:05,201
I must say
I find all this very puzzling

405
00:26:05,277 --> 00:26:07,472
It is puzzling, isn't it, sir?

406
00:26:08,146 --> 00:26:11,309
I mean,
here's this boy, Mario,

407
00:26:11,483 --> 00:26:14,714
sent to the wine cellar
for a bottle of Margaux

408
00:26:14,786 --> 00:26:16,879
and he picks it at random

409
00:26:17,155 --> 00:26:19,817
and it's laced with poison

410
00:26:20,259 --> 00:26:22,750
How do you explain
a thing like that?

411
00:26:24,529 --> 00:26:28,260
Lieutenant Columbo,
I was a friend of Vittorio's

412
00:26:29,801 --> 00:26:31,564
With my compliments

413
00:26:32,404 --> 00:26:35,396
Caviar? Smoked Salmon?

414
00:26:35,941 --> 00:26:37,772
And fois gras

415
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:40,504
Well, thank you very much

416
00:26:40,579 --> 00:26:43,173
This is a sensational layout

417
00:26:43,248 --> 00:26:44,772
Good luck, sir

418
00:26:56,595 --> 00:26:58,586
Gee, this reminds me

419
00:26:59,831 --> 00:27:03,232
Mrs Columbo said
to pick up something
for dinner

420
00:27:03,502 --> 00:27:07,268
PAUL: Now, I know this isn't
my area of expertise,

421
00:27:08,073 --> 00:27:09,597
but I have a theory

422
00:27:09,675 --> 00:27:12,576
Now, please, don't laugh

423
00:27:12,644 --> 00:27:13,941
I wouldn't consider it, sir

424
00:27:14,012 --> 00:27:17,345
It's just that
it could have been
an accident

425
00:27:17,716 --> 00:27:19,081
An accident?

426
00:27:19,151 --> 00:27:21,449
The poison got into
the bottle by accident?

427
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,978
It could have happened
at the chateau,
where the wine was bottled

428
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:29,186
Some insecticide, perhaps,
it spilled, wasn't noticed

429
00:27:29,828 --> 00:27:32,126
The wine was corked
and shipped

430
00:27:32,331 --> 00:27:34,390
Well, that's a very
interesting notion, sir

431
00:27:34,466 --> 00:27:36,957
But the World
Health Organization
has no record

432
00:27:37,035 --> 00:27:39,697
of any outbreak of poisoning
in the French vineyards

433
00:27:39,771 --> 00:27:40,999
I see

434
00:27:41,073 --> 00:27:43,200
Does this feel ripe, sir?

435
00:27:43,275 --> 00:27:45,675
I don't think
it's squishy enough

436
00:27:47,179 --> 00:27:48,578
It's ripe

437
00:27:48,647 --> 00:27:50,979
Sorry about your theory, sir

438
00:27:51,083 --> 00:27:53,608
But there is
another possibility

439
00:27:53,685 --> 00:27:57,678
That Vittorio might have
been planning to murder
somebody himself

440
00:27:57,923 --> 00:28:00,915
And he did have that
dinner date with you, sir

441
00:28:01,493 --> 00:28:05,122
You mean
he planned to murder me?

442
00:28:05,197 --> 00:28:07,097
Well, let's examine it

443
00:28:07,432 --> 00:28:11,664
Suppose it was Vittorio
who put the poison
in the wine bottle

444
00:28:11,737 --> 00:28:13,364
thinking that
you would drink it

445
00:28:13,438 --> 00:28:15,406
And when you walked away,

446
00:28:17,209 --> 00:28:21,373
he made the fatal mistake
of drinking it himself

447
00:28:21,747 --> 00:28:22,941
Yes

448
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:28,651
I can see how that
could be possible

449
00:28:30,188 --> 00:28:31,655
You can, sir?

450
00:28:33,291 --> 00:28:36,055
Well, maybe you can
explain it to me

451
00:28:36,695 --> 00:28:40,324
I mean, how could a man
make a mistake like that?

452
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:44,667
I don't even understand
why Vittorio
would want to kill you

453
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:47,137
Can you think of a reason?

454
00:28:47,205 --> 00:28:49,765
Of course not
You're perfectly right

455
00:28:49,841 --> 00:28:51,672
The whole idea
is ridiculous

456
00:28:51,743 --> 00:28:56,043
Well, it was my idea,
but I'll think
of better ones

457
00:28:56,882 --> 00:28:59,976
How did the poison
get into the wine?

458
00:29:00,118 --> 00:29:01,483
That's the question

459
00:29:01,653 --> 00:29:03,143
But don't worry
about it, sir

460
00:29:03,221 --> 00:29:04,882
I'm gonna write
that out on a card

461
00:29:04,956 --> 00:29:07,948
and I'm gonna paste it up
on my shaving mirror

462
00:29:08,026 --> 00:29:10,824
and that's all
I'm gonna think about

463
00:29:24,309 --> 00:29:25,503
PAUL: Eve

464
00:29:27,746 --> 00:29:29,941
I've been a fool

465
00:29:30,015 --> 00:29:32,711
Interesting
How long have you
been a fool?

466
00:29:32,784 --> 00:29:35,150
Since I forced you
into that damn business

467
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:36,915
with the Irene DeMilo account

468
00:29:36,988 --> 00:29:38,319
It wasn't fair

469
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:39,687
Did you say affair?

470
00:29:39,758 --> 00:29:42,124
Eve, go to the bank
one last time

471
00:29:42,194 --> 00:29:43,593
Oh, no

472
00:29:43,662 --> 00:29:46,995
Close out the account
and go home
and pack your things

473
00:29:47,299 --> 00:29:49,961
I'm moving in?
You will need a passport

474
00:29:50,402 --> 00:29:52,370
A passport?
Your next assignment

475
00:29:53,405 --> 00:29:54,599
Go to Paris

476
00:29:54,673 --> 00:29:56,038
Why?
A new book

477
00:29:56,108 --> 00:29:58,770
It's time to revisit
the great restaurants
of Europe

478
00:29:58,844 --> 00:30:02,041
I'm tied up, so you eat
the food of the gods

479
00:30:02,247 --> 00:30:03,805
I'll meet you in one month

480
00:30:03,882 --> 00:30:07,283
And then we'll travel
the Mediterranean, Spain

481
00:30:07,352 --> 00:30:09,912
Oh, and the Greek islands?
Yes

482
00:30:13,391 --> 00:30:15,018
How selfish I am

483
00:30:15,093 --> 00:30:17,561
You have so much to do
and I keep you in my arms

484
00:30:17,629 --> 00:30:20,120
It's all right
To sum up,
first the bank,

485
00:30:20,198 --> 00:30:22,223
an end to the DeMilo account,

486
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,063
then France,
Italy, Spain

487
00:30:24,136 --> 00:30:25,296
And Monte Carlo

488
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:27,304
You will never forget
Monte Carlo

489
00:30:27,372 --> 00:30:29,169
You have the bank book?

490
00:30:29,241 --> 00:30:31,471
Yes, it's in my bag
Good Hurry back

491
00:30:31,543 --> 00:30:33,602
I'll have your itinerary
You leave tomorrow

492
00:30:33,678 --> 00:30:35,543
Oh, Paul, I need
at least three days

493
00:30:35,614 --> 00:30:37,639
Three days
Wait, what about the dinner?

494
00:30:37,716 --> 00:30:40,150
Europe is calling
Go, go, go

495
00:31:09,347 --> 00:31:11,144
Mario, come ahead

496
00:31:13,818 --> 00:31:15,843
Gerard is still
sitting here

497
00:31:16,421 --> 00:31:20,152
Vittorio, he's over here,
he's putting his plate
on the sink

498
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:22,584
Yelling, carrying on

499
00:31:23,361 --> 00:31:25,192
Gerard gets up
and leaves

500
00:31:25,263 --> 00:31:27,254
The bottle is still corked

501
00:31:27,399 --> 00:31:28,889
Mario goes after him

502
00:31:28,967 --> 00:31:30,229
Mario

503
00:31:32,504 --> 00:31:35,905
Here's where Vittorio
had to open the bottle

504
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:55,592
Drinks

505
00:31:58,230 --> 00:32:00,255
Mario comes back Mario!

506
00:32:01,166 --> 00:32:04,067
This is depressing
This is very depressing

507
00:32:04,202 --> 00:32:07,035
Vittorio picks up the tray,
takes it to the sink

508
00:32:10,675 --> 00:32:12,666
Slams a couple of drawers

509
00:32:13,044 --> 00:32:15,069
He turns around

510
00:32:16,147 --> 00:32:18,581
"What's this? " he says

511
00:32:20,252 --> 00:32:21,981
(SPEAKING ITALIAN)

512
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:26,480

(SPEAKING ITALIAN)

514
00:32:30,729 --> 00:32:32,856
All right,
enough of that

515
00:32:32,931 --> 00:32:33,920
(SPEAKING ITALIAN)

516
00:32:40,672 --> 00:32:43,106
What was he doing
slamming drawers?

517
00:32:57,289 --> 00:32:58,950
(SPEAKING ITALIAN)

518
00:33:06,298 --> 00:33:07,925
Like he broke the drawer?

519
00:33:07,999 --> 00:33:09,591
(SPEAKING ITALIAN)

520
00:33:16,007 --> 00:33:17,474
Cancelled checks

521
00:33:18,043 --> 00:33:20,034
drawn from
Vittorio's bank

522
00:33:20,111 --> 00:33:22,841
$5000, $8000,

523
00:33:23,515 --> 00:33:26,313
$4000, $6000

524
00:33:27,652 --> 00:33:30,348
Holy Toledo Must be
$100,000 worth

Restaurant
Developers Association

526
00:33:32,957 --> 00:33:35,391
They're all made out
to the Restaurant
Developers Association

527
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:37,121
Here's their stamp
on the back

528
00:33:37,195 --> 00:33:39,493
What's the Restaurant
Developers Association?

529
00:33:40,065 --> 00:33:41,396
Never heard of it

530
00:33:41,466 --> 00:33:43,093
Nevertheless,

531
00:33:45,503 --> 00:33:48,904
you'll observe
I'm taking these
into police possession

532
00:33:49,808 --> 00:33:52,936
They gonna tell you
how the poison
got into the wine?

533
00:34:01,953 --> 00:34:04,581
All right, now,
we do it all over again

534
00:34:05,023 --> 00:34:07,719
Not with me
This is too depressing

535
00:34:07,892 --> 00:34:09,416
Wait a minute, Albert

536
00:34:12,931 --> 00:34:14,694
How does this thing work?

537
00:34:16,334 --> 00:34:18,996
I know there's
some kind of cartridge

538
00:34:21,906 --> 00:34:23,168
This

539
00:34:24,743 --> 00:34:26,335
Another clue?

540
00:34:26,411 --> 00:34:28,470
COLUMBO: If there's poison
in that cartridge,

541
00:34:28,546 --> 00:34:30,571
then that's a clue

542
00:34:32,851 --> 00:34:35,649
COLUMBO: I want to take this
down to the police lab

543
00:34:36,388 --> 00:34:38,982
We'll see if the boys there
find any poison

544
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:40,387
Good

545
00:34:41,626 --> 00:34:43,719
You're a good detective

546
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,568
Leave no stone unturned

547
00:34:51,169 --> 00:34:53,831
You want me
to fix you anything else
to eat before I go?

548
00:34:53,905 --> 00:34:55,304
No, thank you very much,
Albert

549
00:34:55,373 --> 00:34:57,307
The poached scallops
will hold me just fine

550
00:34:58,243 --> 00:34:59,335
See you later, kid

551
00:34:59,411 --> 00:35:01,208
(SPEAKING ITALIAN)

552
00:35:06,551 --> 00:35:08,781
That's the kind of man
Vittorio was,

553
00:35:08,853 --> 00:35:11,219
tough when it was good
to be tough,

554
00:35:11,289 --> 00:35:14,019
generous when it was right
to be generous

555
00:35:14,726 --> 00:35:17,923
Now let me tell you something
I don't think you know yet,

556
00:35:18,196 --> 00:35:21,996
how generous he was to me
and to his nephew, Mario

557
00:35:23,034 --> 00:35:26,128
In his will, Vittorio left us
his restaurant

558
00:35:26,204 --> 00:35:29,298
To both of us
With one condition,

559
00:35:29,474 --> 00:35:33,274
that I train Mario
the way Vittorio
would have trained him

560
00:35:33,344 --> 00:35:35,676
To me that means
just one thing

561
00:35:35,747 --> 00:35:39,740
That I train Mario
to be a great man
like his uncle

562
00:35:40,385 --> 00:35:43,582
ALBERT: A great chef
and a great manager

563
00:35:44,022 --> 00:35:45,922
Tough and generous

564
00:35:47,258 --> 00:35:51,194
Okay, Vittorio,
I make you this promise

565
00:35:51,262 --> 00:35:52,559
(INAUDIBLE)

566
00:36:02,207 --> 00:36:04,334
(ALBERT CONTINUES SPEAKING)

567
00:36:33,438 --> 00:36:35,303
ALBERT: Now, friends,
before you go

568
00:36:35,373 --> 00:36:38,274
I know you all want to
get back
You're all busy people

569
00:36:38,977 --> 00:36:41,172
But I want you to know
that the man in charge

570
00:36:41,246 --> 00:36:44,044
of investigating
Vittorio's murder
is here today

571
00:36:44,916 --> 00:36:48,352
The man who is
going to catch that murderer,

572
00:36:48,887 --> 00:36:51,355
Detective Lieutenant Columbo

573
00:36:53,324 --> 00:36:56,350
Lieutenant,
we're behind you,
all of us

574
00:36:56,694 --> 00:36:57,888
And I want you
to know this

575
00:36:57,962 --> 00:36:59,429
As long
as you're on this case,

576
00:36:59,497 --> 00:37:01,362
you'll never go hungry

577
00:37:02,934 --> 00:37:06,802
<i>Arrivederci,</i> Vittorio
<i>Arrivederci</i>

578
00:37:15,446 --> 00:37:19,212
Lieutenant, the opener,

579
00:37:19,384 --> 00:37:22,251
the cartridge,
what did the lab say?

580
00:37:22,554 --> 00:37:24,715
Well, it was
just a cartridge

581
00:37:24,789 --> 00:37:27,257
We still haven't
figured out the poison

582
00:37:29,427 --> 00:37:31,258
(SPEAKING ITALIAN)

583
00:37:48,513 --> 00:37:52,415
Sir, if it'll make you
rest any easier,

584
00:37:53,985 --> 00:37:57,580
I think those checks
are gonna be
a very big help

585
00:38:09,934 --> 00:38:13,392
That dim sum reminds me
of the kind I used to have
at home

586
00:38:13,471 --> 00:38:15,098
At home, Lieutenant?

587
00:38:15,173 --> 00:38:18,142
Right around the corner
from Chinatown
was an Italian neighborhood

588
00:38:18,209 --> 00:38:22,407
When I was a kid
I bet I had more egg rolls
than I had cannelloni

589
00:38:24,649 --> 00:38:27,209
Do you recognize this, ma'am?

590
00:38:27,552 --> 00:38:29,577
It's a cancelled check

591
00:38:29,654 --> 00:38:33,351
I noticed
that you tore it up
at Mr Rossi's grave

592
00:38:37,695 --> 00:38:39,663
But that's all right, ma'am

593
00:38:39,731 --> 00:38:41,358
I've got a lot more

594
00:38:43,034 --> 00:38:45,229
$100,000 worth

595
00:38:47,071 --> 00:38:50,507
I only passed that around
to see who would react to it

596
00:38:51,109 --> 00:38:53,236
Only two people did

597
00:38:53,711 --> 00:38:56,839
You and Mr Duvall

598
00:38:57,949 --> 00:39:00,440
How very clever of you,
Lieutenant

599
00:39:00,518 --> 00:39:02,884
I've been in touch with the
Department of Corporations,
ma'am

600
00:39:02,954 --> 00:39:04,979
I know that Mr Rossi
was the treasurer

601
00:39:05,056 --> 00:39:07,581
of the Restaurant
Developers Association

602
00:39:07,692 --> 00:39:10,559
I know that Mr Duvall
was the vicepresident

603
00:39:10,628 --> 00:39:12,755
And I am the president

604
00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:13,819
Exactly, ma'am

605
00:39:14,966 --> 00:39:17,366
Why was
the Association formed?

606
00:39:18,803 --> 00:39:21,328
To help develop
certain promising restaurants

607
00:39:21,406 --> 00:39:23,397
into commercial successes

608
00:39:24,409 --> 00:39:26,741
And it's been
a smashing failure

609
00:39:27,278 --> 00:39:29,974
Do you know why
Mr Rossi made out
all those checks?

610
00:39:30,348 --> 00:39:32,578
I haven't got
the vaguest idea

611
00:39:32,817 --> 00:39:35,012
We never received the funds

612
00:39:35,086 --> 00:39:38,920
and our commercial account
consists of $175

613
00:39:40,291 --> 00:39:41,690
Well, that's quite
a spread, ma'am

614
00:39:41,759 --> 00:39:45,058
between $175 and $100,000

615
00:39:47,799 --> 00:39:50,427
What happened
to the rest of the money?

616
00:39:50,768 --> 00:39:54,670
You don't think
poor old Vittorio
was up to something nasty?

617
00:39:54,739 --> 00:39:55,933
Ma'am?

618
00:39:56,174 --> 00:39:58,870
I'd hate to believe
he committed suicide

619
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:01,740
Oh, no, ma'am,
that's the furthest thing
from my mind

620
00:40:01,813 --> 00:40:03,838
Never even thought of that

621
00:40:04,549 --> 00:40:07,712
I want to thank you very much
for this tea lunch, ma'am

622
00:40:08,453 --> 00:40:10,318
I enjoyed it immensely

623
00:40:12,023 --> 00:40:15,618
I'll have somebody
come by and pick up
the Association's books

624
00:40:15,927 --> 00:40:18,088
Yes, of course

625
00:40:18,162 --> 00:40:21,620
Lieutenant, you forgot
your fortune cookie

626
00:40:23,267 --> 00:40:26,998
To tell you the truth, ma'am,
I could use some good news

627
00:40:30,374 --> 00:40:31,739
"Cheer up

628
00:40:31,809 --> 00:40:34,937
"There is more
than one fish in the sea"

629
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:38,514
That's the kind I always get

630
00:40:38,583 --> 00:40:43,043
Once I would like it to say
I'm gonna be rich
and go away on a long trip

631
00:40:43,121 --> 00:40:44,986

Join us, please

636
00:41:32,103 --> 00:41:35,368
You're a most welcome
part of this
surprising evening

637
00:41:35,439 --> 00:41:38,772
I wanted you to have
one last taste of Tokyo

638
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:41,544
before you begin your tour
of American restaurants

639
00:41:41,612 --> 00:41:43,944
They won't believe this
when I send back the story

640
00:41:44,015 --> 00:41:46,176
They think I'm eating
hot dogs and grits

641
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:48,115
Have you ever eaten grits?
OZU: No, not yet

642
00:41:48,219 --> 00:41:49,550
Don't bother

<i>Fugu sashimi?</i> Incredible

645
00:42:03,334 --> 00:42:04,926
This cannot really be <i>fugu?</i>

646
00:42:05,002 --> 00:42:08,631
I did it myself,
exactly the way
you taught me

647
00:42:18,783 --> 00:42:20,546
Is it authentic?

648
00:42:21,018 --> 00:42:22,747
I can't believe it

00:42:27,425 --> 00:42:28,551
I'll get it

652
00:42:28,626 --> 00:42:32,357
I'm definitely not home
To anyone

653
00:42:46,878 --> 00:42:48,345
Good evening, ma'am

654
00:42:48,412 --> 00:42:50,607
My name is
Lieutenant Columbo,
Homicide

655
00:42:50,681 --> 00:42:53,309
I'd like to speak
to Mr Gerard
Is he home?

656
00:42:54,685 --> 00:42:56,209
I'm not sure

657
00:42:56,687 --> 00:42:58,484
Is it a big place?

658
00:42:58,689 --> 00:43:01,214
Or is he just out
to the police?

659
00:43:04,195 --> 00:43:08,757
Paul, Lieutenant Columbo
is here

660
00:43:15,473 --> 00:43:16,940
Good evening, Lieutenant

661
00:43:17,008 --> 00:43:18,635
Oh, I beg your pardon, sir

662
00:43:18,709 --> 00:43:20,939
The young lady
didn't tell me
you were eating

663
00:43:21,012 --> 00:43:22,502
It's quite all right

664
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:24,309
How may I help you?

665
00:43:24,448 --> 00:43:27,940
Well, I expected to
Sorry

666
00:43:28,252 --> 00:43:30,914
I expected to see you
at Mr Rossi's funeral

667
00:43:30,988 --> 00:43:32,649
I guess
you couldn't make it

668
00:43:32,723 --> 00:43:34,122
I never go to funerals

669
00:43:34,191 --> 00:43:37,592
I prefer
to remember my friends
as I saw them last

670
00:43:38,095 --> 00:43:40,222
I believe Mr Rossi
was yelling at you

671
00:43:40,298 --> 00:43:43,631
when you saw him last,
isn't that right, sir?

672
00:43:44,235 --> 00:43:46,430
You mustn't
take me literally, Lieutenant

673
00:43:47,338 --> 00:43:48,362
Have you eaten?

674
00:43:48,439 --> 00:43:49,736
Yes, sir

675
00:43:50,708 --> 00:43:53,768
It seems I've been eating
quite a bit lately

676
00:43:54,245 --> 00:43:56,008
It's terrific
A pity

677
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:57,877
You could have joined us

678
00:43:57,949 --> 00:44:01,908
Well,
that's very good of you, sir
Maybe a small bite

679
00:44:02,586 --> 00:44:04,315
I'm delighted

680
00:44:08,893 --> 00:44:11,589
A new setting, please,
for our latest arrival

681
00:44:13,464 --> 00:44:14,692
Sit down, Lieutenant

682
00:44:14,765 --> 00:44:17,063
I'm Eve Plummer,
Mr Gerard's assistant

Pleased to meet you, ma'am

00:44:20,338 --> 00:44:24,798
My distinguished colleague
from Japan, Kanzy Ozu

685
00:44:25,409 --> 00:44:30,073
How do you do, sir?

are professional entertainers

Are you a lieutenant
with the American Army?

00:44:38,656 --> 00:44:41,591
No, sir

Homicide
Right, Lieutenant?

690
00:44:45,663 --> 00:44:47,028
That's right, ma'am

691
00:44:47,865 --> 00:44:51,198
There was a murder movie
on the plane Brilliant

692
00:44:51,602 --> 00:44:54,127
I'm afraid I bore Paul
with the detail

693
00:44:54,205 --> 00:44:56,696
all the way
from the airport

694
00:44:57,775 --> 00:45:00,369
That must have been
the night that Vittorio
was murdered

695
00:45:00,444 --> 00:45:02,105
The very same night

696
00:45:02,313 --> 00:45:04,338
Do you have a hot suspect?

697
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:08,150
Well, I've got my eyes
on one

698
00:45:10,187 --> 00:45:14,055
COLUMBO: Mr Gerard,
this is a lovely place
you have here

699
00:45:14,325 --> 00:45:15,656
Thank you

700
00:45:20,431 --> 00:45:22,456
Oh, that's quite a dish

701
00:45:22,933 --> 00:45:25,333
I've never seen a dish
like this before

702
00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:28,335
What is that called?

703
00:45:28,506 --> 00:45:29,734
Raw fish

704
00:45:29,807 --> 00:45:33,766
In Japanese,
it is <i>fugu sashimi</i>
A delicacy

705
00:45:34,111 --> 00:45:36,443
Why don't you try it?
It's a developed taste

706
00:45:36,514 --> 00:45:40,416
I think the Lieutenant
would prefer
one of the cooked dishes

707
00:45:40,584 --> 00:45:43,678
Oh, I am sure
there is nothing wrong
with his taste

708
00:45:44,355 --> 00:45:45,754
Allow me

709
00:45:46,357 --> 00:45:48,848
<i>Fugu</i> for the Lieutenant

710
00:46:02,606 --> 00:46:04,130
Gee, that's funny

711
00:46:05,476 --> 00:46:09,640
I thought that the <i>fugu</i>
was gonna taste
like tuna fish

712
00:46:17,388 --> 00:46:19,117
Did I say something wrong?

713
00:46:19,957 --> 00:46:22,255
Not exactly
Shall we tell him?

714
00:46:22,326 --> 00:46:25,693
I don't think
our guest is interested
in fish stories

715
00:46:26,163 --> 00:46:28,757
Eve's off tomorrow night
on a trip to Europe,

716
00:46:28,933 --> 00:46:31,595
to visit
every major restaurant
on the continent

717
00:46:31,669 --> 00:46:35,571
Lieutenant,
they're having a little joke
at your expense

718
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:37,737
The fish
you have just eaten,

719
00:46:37,808 --> 00:46:41,369
what you call a blowfish
or puffer fish,

720
00:46:41,912 --> 00:46:43,573
is deadly poison

721
00:46:48,052 --> 00:46:49,314
Is it?

722
00:46:50,154 --> 00:46:53,419
Except when it's prepared
by a master chef

723
00:46:54,091 --> 00:46:55,888
Then it's heavenly

724
00:46:56,961 --> 00:47:01,193
In Japan,
the chef must be licensed
by the Department of Health

725
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:03,396
Every year
hundreds of people die

726
00:47:03,467 --> 00:47:05,867
trying to prepare
<i>fugu</i> themselves

727
00:47:06,237 --> 00:47:08,137
Holy mackerel

728
00:47:08,372 --> 00:47:09,771
Excuse me?

729
00:47:10,141 --> 00:47:13,838
I was just thinking
about a fortune cookie
that I read today

730
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:19,179
Mr Gerard,
this has been educational,

731
00:47:19,250 --> 00:47:21,844
but I really have to be
running along

732
00:47:21,986 --> 00:47:24,318
Ma'am, enjoy your trip

733
00:47:25,089 --> 00:47:26,556
Mr Ozu

734

<i>Sayonara, sayonara</i>

735
00:47:45,309 --> 00:47:47,573
Oh, one more thing

736
00:47:48,379 --> 00:47:50,904
Gee, I almost forgot
what I came here to ask you

737
00:47:50,981 --> 00:47:53,074
Fortunately you remembered

738
00:47:53,350 --> 00:47:55,409
As you're an expert
on restaurants, sir,

739
00:47:55,486 --> 00:47:57,454
I wanted to ask you,

740
00:47:58,322 --> 00:48:02,725
do you know anything
about the Restaurant
Developers Association?

741
00:48:04,828 --> 00:48:07,194
I don't know
anything about it,
Lieutenant

742
00:48:07,264 --> 00:48:09,755
I've never heard of it
Have you?

743
00:48:11,936 --> 00:48:13,369
No

744
00:48:13,904 --> 00:48:15,496
No, Lieutenant, I'm sorry

745
00:48:15,573 --> 00:48:17,768
Well,
that's all right, ma'am

746
00:48:17,875 --> 00:48:19,706
As the Chinese say,

747
00:48:20,778 --> 00:48:23,406
there's more
than one fish in the sea

748
00:48:35,492 --> 00:48:38,655
CRAWFORD: Vittorio and I
had a binding agreement

749
00:48:38,729 --> 00:48:42,460
He didn't lend money
and we didn't make lasagna

750
00:48:43,467 --> 00:48:45,628
This was his favorite
coffee cake

751
00:48:45,703 --> 00:48:48,968
I used to serve it
every time he came by to talk

752
00:48:51,875 --> 00:48:54,275
Oh, my, oh

753
00:48:54,745 --> 00:48:56,975
Oh, this is sensational

754
00:48:57,915 --> 00:48:59,644
We always used to think so

755
00:48:59,717 --> 00:49:02,652
Restaurant Developers'
commercial account

756
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:04,787
Oh, thank you

757
00:49:05,990 --> 00:49:08,720
Scrumptious
Let me help you, ma'am

758
00:49:09,159 --> 00:49:12,287
This is the best cake
I have ever eaten

759
00:49:13,330 --> 00:49:14,695
As you can see,
Mr Crawford,

760
00:49:14,765 --> 00:49:18,633
a balance of $17512

761
00:49:19,637 --> 00:49:21,662
As I told you, Lieutenant

762
00:49:23,707 --> 00:49:25,766
Then we have
the savings account

763
00:49:25,843 --> 00:49:27,834
Say what? Account, what?

764
00:49:27,911 --> 00:49:31,108
The Restaurant Developers
also has a savings account
at the bank

765
00:49:32,249 --> 00:49:34,877
You know that's what
Mrs Columbo said?

766
00:49:35,586 --> 00:49:39,647
She said there's probably
two accounts

767
00:49:39,823 --> 00:49:42,018
and somehow
they got mixed up

768
00:49:42,159 --> 00:49:43,717
I beg your pardon,
Lieutenant,

769
00:49:43,794 --> 00:49:46,160
these accounts
are not mixed up,

770
00:49:46,230 --> 00:49:49,393
but a corporate savings
account is a little unusual

771
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:51,695
This savings account,
excuse me,

772
00:49:52,369 --> 00:49:55,065
is where Mr Vittorio's
checks were deposited

773
00:49:55,139 --> 00:49:57,664
Also the checks
from Chez Duvall

774
00:49:57,741 --> 00:49:59,675
and the House of Shanghai

775
00:50:00,978 --> 00:50:02,809
(WHISTLES)

776
00:50:06,650 --> 00:50:10,108
Who has access
to this account?

777
00:50:10,487 --> 00:50:13,388
Just one person
A Mrs Irene DeMilo

778
00:50:13,757 --> 00:50:16,248
I would like to speak
to Mrs DeMilo

779
00:50:17,061 --> 00:50:18,119
Claire

780
00:50:18,195 --> 00:50:20,789
Her only address
seems to be
a post office box

781
00:50:20,864 --> 00:50:23,389
She came in two days ago
and closed out the account

782
00:50:23,467 --> 00:50:25,901
She asked me to draw up
a cashier's check

783
00:50:26,036 --> 00:50:27,833
for everything in the account

784
00:50:27,905 --> 00:50:30,100
Except $3000

785
00:50:31,308 --> 00:50:34,505
She took out $3000 in cash

786
00:50:34,745 --> 00:50:36,007
In travelers' checks

787
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:37,877
In travelers' checks

788
00:50:39,183 --> 00:50:41,777
This is the best cake
I've ever eaten

789
00:50:45,556 --> 00:50:48,252
Would you say
this looks like me,
Lieutenant?

790
00:50:51,095 --> 00:50:53,586
I'd say it doesn't
do you justice, Miss Plummer

791
00:50:53,664 --> 00:50:55,256
You're an angel

792
00:50:55,332 --> 00:50:57,300
I'm sorry about Mr Gerard

793
00:50:57,368 --> 00:50:59,268
I know, ma'am He's busy
at the Chez Duvall

794
00:50:59,336 --> 00:51:01,702
He's getting ready
for tonight's
Restaurant Writers' dinner

795
00:51:01,772 --> 00:51:03,706
I'll be thinking
about you on the plane

796
00:51:03,774 --> 00:51:05,401
You are going to the dinner,
aren't you?

797
00:51:05,476 --> 00:51:06,602
Oh, certainly, ma'am

798
00:51:06,677 --> 00:51:09,009
Mrs Columbo and I,
we appreciate the invitation

799
00:51:09,079 --> 00:51:10,876
Wouldn't miss it
for the world

800
00:51:10,948 --> 00:51:13,644
You should've
been there last year
It was terrific

801
00:51:13,851 --> 00:51:16,149
Oh, Mrs DeMilo
Yes, Lieuten

802
00:51:23,327 --> 00:51:24,794
The bank

803
00:51:25,929 --> 00:51:27,487
The bank, Miss Plummer

804
00:51:28,332 --> 00:51:31,233
Only in this case,
it's more like a laundry

805
00:51:32,536 --> 00:51:35,130
I have a feeling
I just blew a trip
to Europe

806
00:51:37,775 --> 00:51:40,073
I suppose
there'll be questions

807
00:51:40,177 --> 00:51:41,576
Let's begin

808
00:51:42,045 --> 00:51:45,173
with where Mr Gerard
buys his fish

809
00:51:46,316 --> 00:51:47,681
His fish?

810
00:51:47,918 --> 00:51:49,510
His fish, ma'am

811
00:51:56,126 --> 00:51:58,822
How did the poison
get into the bottle?

812

The banquet, I know

814
00:52:27,958 --> 00:52:30,358
How did the poison
get into the

815
00:52:38,335 --> 00:52:39,893
Who's been here?

816

817
00:52:42,506 --> 00:52:44,440
Nobody's been here

818
00:52:47,578 --> 00:52:49,808
Now we're going
to the banquet

819
00:52:49,913 --> 00:52:53,144
Now we're gonna get
something terrific to eat

821
00:53:12,336 --> 00:53:14,827
No Mrs Columbo this evening?

822
00:53:15,105 --> 00:53:18,666
Oh, well, sir
It's her night school
Final exam in accounting

823
00:53:18,775 --> 00:53:20,572
She was dying to come here

824

but at the last minute
she decided she'd better
take the exam

What are you doing here?

853
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:25,355
You're supposed to be
on a plane to Paris

00:56:25,429 --> 00:56:27,090
That was Irene DeMilo

<i>Ciao</i>

Mr Gerard, sir

Yes, Lieutenant

875
00:57:47,778 --> 00:57:50,076
Now that this case
is almost over,

876
00:57:50,147 --> 00:57:51,978
this might be
our last opportunity

877
00:57:52,048 --> 00:57:53,913
to cook
something up together
Yes

878
00:57:53,984 --> 00:57:57,010
Who knows when our paths
will cross again?

879
00:57:57,087 --> 00:57:59,521
Vittorio's will still
be closed tomorrow

880
00:57:59,823 --> 00:58:02,621
Maybe we could
get to use all those
terrific tools

881
00:58:02,692 --> 00:58:04,660
and that beautiful stove

882
00:58:04,761 --> 00:58:06,126
What do you say, sir?

883
00:58:06,196 --> 00:58:07,891
Would you join me
around noon?

884
00:58:07,964 --> 00:58:11,058
Lieutenant,
if you hadn't brought it up,

885
00:58:11,134 --> 00:58:13,227
I was about to
suggest it myself

886
00:58:58,448 --> 00:59:01,542
Lieutenant, I'm late
I'm sorry

887
00:59:03,620 --> 00:59:05,815
I'm just chopping up
some shallots

888
00:59:06,356 --> 00:59:08,017
Two should be enough

889
00:59:08,358 --> 00:59:09,552
For what?

890
00:59:09,626 --> 00:59:11,116
A recipe from my pop

891
00:59:11,194 --> 00:59:13,628
He used to cook for us kids
when my mother
was in the hospital

892
00:59:13,697 --> 00:59:14,789
having a baby

893
00:59:15,165 --> 00:59:17,656
That was about
once a year
for a while there

894
00:59:19,336 --> 00:59:20,769
Veal scallops

895
00:59:21,571 --> 00:59:25,200
Slightly seasoned
with salt and white pepper

896
00:59:25,876 --> 00:59:29,039
Somehow it looks
better on veal
than black pepper

897
00:59:29,446 --> 00:59:31,277
The dried fresh
mushrooms, sir,

898
00:59:31,348 --> 00:59:34,112
they're diced
and they're soaking in a dish
on the counter

899
00:59:35,752 --> 00:59:38,585
Now could this dish of yours
possibly be

900
00:59:39,189 --> 00:59:42,215
<i>escalopes de veau</i>
<i>aux cיpes?</i>

901
00:59:42,425 --> 00:59:44,620
Well, pop just called
it scaloppini

902
00:59:45,128 --> 00:59:47,688
Let's see if we can find
a goodsized pan

903
00:59:48,598 --> 00:59:49,826
This is fine

904
00:59:50,433 --> 00:59:53,061
I'm just gonna heat up
some sweet butter

905
00:59:56,273 --> 00:59:58,138
About a tablespoon or so

906
00:59:59,175 --> 01:00:00,802
And a dash of olive oil

907
01:00:00,877 --> 01:00:03,903
Olive oil first keeps
the butter from burning,

908
01:00:04,514 --> 01:00:08,075
Well, this is the way
they did it
where pop came from

909
01:00:08,618 --> 01:00:11,815
He was from the
old country, like Vittorio

910
01:00:12,022 --> 01:00:14,786
Oh, I'll prepare the dressing
for the salad

911
01:00:15,425 --> 01:00:17,893
You know, I've been thinking
about the murder, sir

912
01:00:17,961 --> 01:00:20,293
We were all wrong
about the poison

913
01:00:20,363 --> 01:00:23,855
It wasn't in any
of the bottles down
in the wine cellar

914
01:00:23,967 --> 01:00:26,492
So the only other possibility

915
01:00:27,904 --> 01:00:30,134
is that the killer
brought it with him

916
01:00:30,340 --> 01:00:31,671
But why?

917
01:00:32,042 --> 01:00:35,307
I'm gonna start
browning up the veal, sir
Just a few at a time

918
01:00:38,548 --> 01:00:41,642
Yes, I think you're gonna
be interested in
the killer's motive

919
01:00:43,053 --> 01:00:44,418
Undoubtedly

920
01:00:44,788 --> 01:00:48,588
He was a silent partner
in the Restaurant
Developers Association

921
01:00:48,725 --> 01:00:50,886
You remember
I mentioned that to you

922
01:00:50,961 --> 01:00:52,394
Yes, you did

923
01:00:53,029 --> 01:00:57,261
Vittorio and the others were
paying the killer a lot
of money for many years

924
01:00:58,034 --> 01:01:01,663
You see, he was someone
in a position to
publicize their restaurants

925
01:01:01,738 --> 01:01:03,399
and make them successful

926
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:08,368
Or else he could
print a few bad items
and demolish them

927
01:01:10,313 --> 01:01:14,579
What it was,
it was a form of extortion

928
01:01:15,652 --> 01:01:17,244
Would you like
some wine, sir?

929
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:20,517
There's an open bottle
on the table, help yourself

930
01:01:23,393 --> 01:01:24,655
Thank you

931
01:01:25,628 --> 01:01:28,529
Would you care for a glass,
Lieutenant?
Yes, sir

932
01:01:28,631 --> 01:01:29,859
Coming up

933
01:01:31,434 --> 01:01:34,460
I could also use

934
01:01:35,538 --> 01:01:37,836
about a half a cup
for my scaloppine

935
01:01:38,108 --> 01:01:41,271
Please, please,
go on with your explanation

936
01:01:42,612 --> 01:01:44,011
I'm fascinated

937
01:01:44,114 --> 01:01:46,309
It went on that way
for some time, sir,

938
01:01:46,383 --> 01:01:49,011
with Vittorio paying off
along with the other people

939
01:01:49,886 --> 01:01:53,322
But after a while,
he didn't want to pay anymore

940
01:01:54,190 --> 01:01:56,715
He might even have
made threats on his own

941
01:01:57,594 --> 01:02:00,757
And that was the motive
for the murder, sir

942
01:02:01,931 --> 01:02:04,764
You're right
That's very interesting

943
01:02:05,168 --> 01:02:06,328
But

944
01:02:07,804 --> 01:02:09,965
But it's only conjecture,
of course

945
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:11,064
Oh, yes

946
01:02:11,141 --> 01:02:13,769
We have no way of knowing
for certain

947
01:02:14,377 --> 01:02:17,835
No, unless we got
a lot of cooperation

948
01:02:17,914 --> 01:02:20,246
from the other people
in the Association

949
01:02:20,417 --> 01:02:21,509
Correct

950
01:02:21,584 --> 01:02:25,042
Oh I forgot your wine
I'll open another bottle

951
01:02:32,362 --> 01:02:34,489
I'm taking out the veal, sir

952
01:02:36,533 --> 01:02:40,060
Then I'm gonna add my shallots
and my mushrooms

953
01:02:41,037 --> 01:02:43,733
and let 'em bubble
around in the pan
for a minute or so

954
01:02:44,741 --> 01:02:47,039
You look perfectly at home
in a kitchen

955
01:02:47,510 --> 01:02:48,738
It's amazing

956
01:02:48,978 --> 01:02:50,969
When I was growing up, sir,

957
01:02:51,047 --> 01:02:53,277
that's where we spent
most of our time

958
01:02:53,750 --> 01:02:57,345
We had a living room
that was mostly for visits
from the teacher

959
01:02:58,221 --> 01:02:59,552
and funerals

960
01:03:00,757 --> 01:03:02,622
I'm adding the wine, sir

961
01:03:09,032 --> 01:03:10,363
Your wine

962
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:13,596
Oh, just set it down
for a moment, sir

963
01:03:13,670 --> 01:03:16,468
I want to stir this around
for a minute or two

964
01:03:20,243 --> 01:03:21,437
By the way,

965
01:03:22,412 --> 01:03:24,312
the night Vittorio died,

966
01:03:25,982 --> 01:03:30,078
you never did intend
to eat his whole meal,
did you, sir?

967
01:03:30,153 --> 01:03:31,484
What makes you say that?

968
01:03:31,554 --> 01:03:33,317
Well,
the appointment book, sir

969
01:03:33,389 --> 01:03:35,220
Mr Rossi had you down
for 8:00

970
01:03:35,291 --> 01:03:36,724
I arrived at 8:00

971
01:03:37,894 --> 01:03:40,920
Well, then you went to the
airport later on
To pick up Mr Ozu

972
01:03:41,331 --> 01:03:43,196
Mr Ozu says

973
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:45,830
that he came in
on the movie flight

974
01:03:45,935 --> 01:03:48,096
and according to
the airline schedule, sir,

975
01:03:48,171 --> 01:03:51,368
the only movie flight
arrived at 8:55

976
01:03:51,508 --> 01:03:54,705
And since you
planned to meet that plane,
Mr Gerard,

977
01:03:55,378 --> 01:03:57,676
there is no way that
you could have enjoyed

978
01:03:57,747 --> 01:03:59,339
an entire meal

979
01:03:59,415 --> 01:04:02,384
and still got to the airport
in 55 minutes

980
01:04:02,886 --> 01:04:07,220
So, you knew that
you were going to
leave early, sir

981
01:04:07,957 --> 01:04:11,518
You never intended
to eat Vittorio's dinner

982
01:04:13,630 --> 01:04:14,790
Bravo

983
01:04:15,064 --> 01:04:16,292
Lieutenant,

984
01:04:16,933 --> 01:04:18,025
guilty

985
01:04:18,401 --> 01:04:21,029
I was going to make
some excuse to Vittorio

986
01:04:21,104 --> 01:04:22,571
As it turned out,

987
01:04:23,873 --> 01:04:25,067
I didn't have to

988
01:04:25,141 --> 01:04:27,939
You're doing very well
Very well

989
01:04:29,212 --> 01:04:31,476
What else have you learned?

990
01:04:32,749 --> 01:04:35,240
I'm adding the veal
to the pan, sir

991
01:04:38,655 --> 01:04:39,952
Oh!

992
01:04:40,757 --> 01:04:45,057
The boys at the lab
finally got a fix on
that poison the killer used

993
01:04:45,261 --> 01:04:47,320
It was Japanese

994
01:04:48,731 --> 01:04:50,665
blowfish poison

995
01:04:52,101 --> 01:04:53,363
<i>Fugu?</i>

996
01:04:54,037 --> 01:04:55,732
You can't be serious <i>Fugu?</i>

997
01:04:55,872 --> 01:04:57,772
It's a terrific poison

998
01:04:58,808 --> 01:05:00,969
The killer knew
we couldn't trace it

999
01:05:01,044 --> 01:05:02,773
And between you and me,

1000
01:05:02,879 --> 01:05:05,370
he had access
to that kind of fish

1001
01:05:05,448 --> 01:05:08,747
There's a fish store
in Little Tokyo

1002
01:05:08,818 --> 01:05:11,514
that buys them off
a couple of fishermen

1003
01:05:11,888 --> 01:05:16,587
But how did
the murderer get the <i>fugu</i>
poison into the bottle?

1004
01:05:18,461 --> 01:05:20,759
Excuse the outburst,
Lieutenant

1005
01:05:21,564 --> 01:05:22,895
Lieutenant,

1006
01:05:23,666 --> 01:05:27,602
Vittorio was alone
when he opened the bottle

1007
01:05:28,504 --> 01:05:29,801
Right, sir

1008
01:05:30,673 --> 01:05:32,231
Right
Right

1009
01:05:35,645 --> 01:05:39,308
Vittorio was indeed alone

1010
01:05:44,420 --> 01:05:46,388
Ah, that's the point, sir

1011
01:05:47,590 --> 01:05:50,320
Now, a very odd thing
happened here the other day,

1012
01:05:50,393 --> 01:05:53,089
when I was recreating
the crime as they say

1013
01:05:53,162 --> 01:05:56,325
Just before you arrived here
at Vittorio's kitchen,

1014
01:05:56,733 --> 01:05:58,758
Albert took this apart for me

1015
01:05:59,369 --> 01:06:01,200
because I wanted to
take the cartridge

1016
01:06:01,271 --> 01:06:03,569
down to the lab to have
the boys check it out

1017
01:06:08,111 --> 01:06:10,011
And what did they find?

1018
01:06:10,413 --> 01:06:13,280
Not a thing, sir
But, and here's what's odd,

1019
01:06:14,284 --> 01:06:17,617
Albert put a nice,
fresh, new, full cartridge

1020
01:06:17,687 --> 01:06:19,314
into the opener for me

1021
01:06:19,455 --> 01:06:22,151
And nobody used
that opener until last night

1022
01:06:22,225 --> 01:06:24,455
when just
before the banquet,

1023
01:06:24,527 --> 01:06:28,623
I myself, sitting right here,
tried to open
a bottle of wine

1024
01:06:29,899 --> 01:06:32,959
and the opener was empty, sir,
flat out

1025
01:06:35,338 --> 01:06:37,169
From which you concluded?

1026
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:38,935
I asked myself,

1027
01:06:39,409 --> 01:06:41,502
I asked myself,

1028
01:06:41,644 --> 01:06:45,239
how does a full cartridge
become an empty cartridge

1029
01:06:45,315 --> 01:06:47,215
without opening any bottles?

1030
01:06:47,817 --> 01:06:49,648
And the answer was,

1031
01:06:53,990 --> 01:06:57,187
somebody's been switching
bottle openers around here

1032
01:06:59,395 --> 01:07:01,625
Switching?
Switching more
than once, sir

1033
01:07:02,231 --> 01:07:03,630
That's my opinion

1034
01:07:04,467 --> 01:07:05,764
And then there's this

1035
01:07:09,138 --> 01:07:10,571
You see this, sir?

1036
01:07:10,873 --> 01:07:12,170
Yes

1037
01:07:12,575 --> 01:07:16,102
Well, this hollow needle
could also hold a tiny bit
of poison,

1038
01:07:16,446 --> 01:07:19,677
probably injected with
a hypodermic syringe

1039
01:07:19,949 --> 01:07:22,645
And that's what
the killer prepared, sir

1040
01:07:23,953 --> 01:07:27,548
He took an opener
identical to the one
that Vittorio used

1041
01:07:27,724 --> 01:07:30,090
and he put poison
in the needle

1042
01:07:30,860 --> 01:07:33,590
And he took that opener
with him to the dinner

1043
01:07:34,497 --> 01:07:37,864
and at an opportune time,
he switched the openers

1044
01:07:38,768 --> 01:07:42,260
So when Vittorio
was by himself in the kitchen,

1045
01:07:42,605 --> 01:07:45,005
and the boy was showing you
to the door,

1046
01:07:45,508 --> 01:07:48,477
Vittorio used
the switched opener

1047
01:07:49,312 --> 01:07:51,542
to poison his own wine

1048
01:07:52,749 --> 01:07:54,216
You understand, sir?

1049
01:07:55,818 --> 01:07:58,309
Lieutenant,
I regret to tell you

1050
01:07:59,055 --> 01:08:01,819
that I understand
all too well

1051
01:08:05,128 --> 01:08:07,323
It was
a terrific scheme, sir

1052
01:08:07,864 --> 01:08:09,832
Your only mistake
was coming back

1053
01:08:09,899 --> 01:08:13,198
the next night so that you
could switch back the openers

1054
01:08:13,669 --> 01:08:15,967
so we couldn't find
any trace of poison

1055
01:08:16,506 --> 01:08:20,272
and that was right
after Albert put in
the fresh cartridge

1056
01:08:21,911 --> 01:08:23,469
Brilliantly deduced

1057
01:08:26,549 --> 01:08:31,111
Shall we drink
to your successful
solution of the case?

1058
01:08:35,458 --> 01:08:38,086
I couldn't have done it, sir,
without your help

1059
01:08:49,539 --> 01:08:51,131
On the other hand,

1060
01:08:51,874 --> 01:08:55,435
there remains
a matter of proof

1061
01:08:55,945 --> 01:08:58,379
Oh, I can't prove
any of this, sir

1062
01:08:59,148 --> 01:09:00,945
But it did bother me

1063
01:09:01,284 --> 01:09:05,311
that there was a poisoned
opener around
the exact twin of this one

1064
01:09:06,289 --> 01:09:08,723
So when I came in
here today,
I took the trouble

1065
01:09:08,791 --> 01:09:11,760
of putting a little nick
in the top

1066
01:09:12,829 --> 01:09:14,353
Right there, sir

1067
01:09:16,098 --> 01:09:18,191
But you'll notice
there is no nick

1068
01:09:20,670 --> 01:09:21,830
See?

1069
01:09:21,904 --> 01:09:22,893
Yes

1070
01:09:23,339 --> 01:09:25,307
It must be
a different opener

1071
01:09:26,342 --> 01:09:28,537
No question about it

1072
01:09:32,982 --> 01:09:35,849
Ah! I wouldn't, sir

1073
01:09:36,853 --> 01:09:38,218
Don't drink

1074
01:09:39,755 --> 01:09:42,189
You switched
the openers again

1075
01:09:43,726 --> 01:09:45,694
but I switched the glasses

1076
01:09:45,928 --> 01:09:48,089
That's the poisoned
glass, sir

1077
01:09:48,164 --> 01:09:50,496
The glass I was
supposed to drink

1078
01:09:53,636 --> 01:09:56,400
I'll just keep this for
the boys down in the lab

1079
01:09:58,107 --> 01:10:00,234
That's what they call proof

1080
01:10:05,715 --> 01:10:07,615
You must try this, sir

1081
01:10:08,351 --> 01:10:10,945
I'm really interested
in your opinion

1082
01:10:13,556 --> 01:10:15,990
You're a very
able man, Lieutenant

1083
01:10:17,660 --> 01:10:19,252
I respect that

1084
01:10:23,900 --> 01:10:26,232
But I really don't
care for you very much

1085
01:10:27,670 --> 01:10:30,366
You know, sir,
I was thinking
the same thing about you

1086
01:10:30,606 --> 01:10:32,471
I respect your talent

1087
01:10:34,443 --> 01:10:36,434
But I don't like anything else
about you

1088
01:10:41,017 --> 01:10:43,076
The dressing is perfect

1089
01:10:43,786 --> 01:10:45,048
Thank you

1090
01:10:57,733 --> 01:10:59,633
When did you
first suspect me?

1091
01:10:59,835 --> 01:11:01,632
Well, as it happens, sir,

1092
01:11:04,373 --> 01:11:06,568
about two minutes
after I met you

1093
01:11:06,842 --> 01:11:08,207
That can't be possible

1094
01:11:08,277 --> 01:11:11,007
Oh, you made it
perfectly clear, sir,

1095
01:11:11,681 --> 01:11:13,740
the very first night,

1096
01:11:15,651 --> 01:11:18,211
when you decided to
come to the restaurant

1097
01:11:19,322 --> 01:11:21,552
directly after
you were informed

1098
01:11:21,624 --> 01:11:23,524
that Vittorio was poisoned

1099
01:11:23,593 --> 01:11:26,289
I was instructed to
come here by the police

1100
01:11:26,362 --> 01:11:28,387
And you came, sir
Yes

1101
01:11:28,464 --> 01:11:31,831
After eating
dinner with a man
that had been poisoned

1102
01:11:32,868 --> 01:11:34,699
You didn't go to a doctor

1103
01:11:35,037 --> 01:11:38,529
You came because
the police instructed you

1104
01:11:39,041 --> 01:11:41,032
You didn't go to a hospital,

1105
01:11:41,477 --> 01:11:44,708
you didn't even ask to
have your stomach pumped

1106
01:11:45,047 --> 01:11:46,446
Mr Gerard,

1107
01:11:47,984 --> 01:11:50,077
that's the damnedest example

1108
01:11:50,152 --> 01:11:52,586
of good citizenship
I've ever seen

1109
01:11:57,093 --> 01:11:58,287
I see

1110
01:12:04,433 --> 01:12:05,730
I see

1111
01:12:21,350 --> 01:12:23,045
What do you think?

1112
01:12:27,356 --> 01:12:28,687
Lieutenant,

1113
01:12:30,192 --> 01:12:31,750
I wish you had been a chef

1114
01:12:34,964 --> 01:12:36,488
I understand, sir

1115
01:12:37,305 --> 01:13:37,343
