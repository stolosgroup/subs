00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,945
<i>Now, I know
that I am no better</i>

3
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:16,749
<i>than any of my fellow nominees</i>

4
00:00:16,833 --> 00:00:20,707
<i>or any other human in this room
or on this planet.</i>

5
00:00:20,791 --> 00:00:26,374
I also believe that interspecies
equality is paramount.

6
00:00:27,875 --> 00:00:31,707
<i>And yet we go into nature
and we pillage and we ransack.</i>

7
00:00:31,791 --> 00:00:37,541
<i>We use machines to impregnate
the innocent dairy cow.</i>

8
00:00:37,625 --> 00:00:41,032
<i>Then callously snatch away
her baby</i>

9

<i>as she cries out...</i>

10
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:44,124
- Why do they do this?
<i>- ...in despair.</i>

11
00:00:44,208 --> 00:00:46,157
Even Woody Harrelson
makes speeches like this.

12
00:00:46,242 --> 00:00:47,938
It's just an Oscar. It's not
the Nobel Peace Prize,

13
00:00:48,022 --> 00:00:48,758
- right?
- Yeah.

14
00:00:48,843 --> 00:00:50,666
You know what my speech would be
if I win an Oscar?

15
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,457
- What? What?
- "I wanna thank the Academy

16
00:00:52,541 --> 00:00:54,416
and don't allow babies
on planes, goodnight."

17
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,957
- They'd love that speech.
- I know.

18
00:00:56,041 --> 00:00:58,124
- You'd be a hero.
<i>- Then we take</i>

19
00:00:58,208 --> 00:01:00,332
<i>the life milk
meant for her calf,</i>

20
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:04,666
<i>and we use it for cream
in our lattes.</i>

21
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:08,582
Okay. All this stuff aside,
he'd be so great for Uncle Mo

22
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:09,874
for the show, don't you think?

23
00:01:09,958 --> 00:01:12,041
- Oh, my God, yes.
- Tough to get.

24
00:01:12,125 --> 00:01:13,249
Yeah, well, I don't know.

25
00:01:13,333 --> 00:01:15,582
I guess it couldn't hurt
to get him a script, right?

26
00:01:15,666 --> 00:01:17,082
Could not hurt at all.

27
00:01:17,166 --> 00:01:18,566
- Oh, hi, Lar.
- Oh, hey.

28
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:19,886
Got some more fabric.

29
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:22,333
Look at this tapestry
I'm making for the temple.

30
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,033
Is that something?

31
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:25,941
I've never been
more proud of her.

32
00:01:26,025 --> 00:01:28,041
- It's the tree of life.
- Did you sew that?

33
00:01:28,125 --> 00:01:29,408
- Yeah!
- Yeah. It's a banner

34
00:01:29,492 --> 00:01:30,541
for our temple football team.

35
00:01:30,625 --> 00:01:32,499
We're playing Beth Hillel.

36
00:01:32,583 --> 00:01:34,332
And their defense is ridiculous.

37
00:01:34,416 --> 00:01:37,332
They sacked our rabbi
six times last season.

38
00:01:37,416 --> 00:01:39,666
Speaking of the temple,
you know, our rabbi

39
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,207
is an amazing guy.

40
00:01:41,291 --> 00:01:43,624
Lar, you, of all people
would love this guy.

41
00:01:43,708 --> 00:01:45,957
- Oh, would I?
- He's cool, he's hip,

42
00:01:46,041 --> 00:01:48,999
- he's spiritual. He's just fantastic.
- Oh, yeah. The hip rabbi. Yeah.

43
00:01:49,083 --> 00:01:50,916
- Yeah, sure.
- He's a big golfer.

44
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,541
Can't afford a fancy-schmancy
club like we belong to.

45
00:01:54,625 --> 00:01:55,999
- Uh-huh.
- So I think it would be

46
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:58,916
a nice gesture for you
to take him as a guest.

47
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,041
- Take him to the club with me?
- Yeah. Come on.

48
00:02:02,125 --> 00:02:04,374
- Oh, geez.
- One round.

49
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:07,749
- This is gonna make you happy?
- Very happy.

50
00:02:07,833 --> 00:02:10,291
- All right, fine.
- Aw. Thank you.

51
00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:11,666
Thank you so much.

52
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:18,166
Oh, come on, man!
No.

53
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,541
- Come on. Come on.
- Oh, come on.

54
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:21,884
You think I wouldn't
do it for you?

55
00:02:21,968 --> 00:02:23,374
- Oh, geez.
- I'mma leave you hangin'?

56
00:02:23,458 --> 00:02:25,374
I'm old. Come on.

I can't waste a day playing golf
with a rabbi.

58

Every minute
is precious to me now.

59
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:31,457
- Oh, let me...
- At this time of my life, I...

60
00:02:31,541 --> 00:02:34,332
- He's a great guy, Larry.
- That's a four-hour favor.

61
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:35,999
And five, if you include lunch.

62
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:38,207
Come on, play golf
with the cool rabbi and me.

63
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:39,916
You'd be doing me a big favor,
come on.

64
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,666
- Oh, it's a favor.
- I appreciate it so much.

65
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,832
I am doing you a favor.

66
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:46,499
How many times are you gonna
remind me of this now?

67
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:49,749
- As often as I can.
- Thank you, anyway. Both of you.

Hey, I got a, uh, text from
Woody Harrelson's people.

72

He's interested.
They're gonna set up a meeting.

- Really?

your girlfriend this week.

- Yeah.

Oh, I'm so glad. You're gonna
love her, she's terrific.

- Yeah.

82

Gentlemen, I'm gonna show you
how this is done.

83
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:32,916
- Never again.
- I know, I know.

84
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,166
Uh... I appreciate it.

85
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,457
You know, the High Holy Days
are coming up pretty soon.

That is just so exciting,
is it not?

It sure would be nice
to see you in temple.

88
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:42,999
Yeah. Okay.
Don't hold your breath.

89
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:45,124
It's been a while since
you've been to this temple.

90
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:47,791
I think never is the more
appropriate word.

91
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:49,416
Well,
maybe we can remedy that.

92
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,416
- How about a little wager?
- Sure, fine.

93
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,082
I sink this putt, you come
to my temple for services.

94
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:58,416
- Oh, yeah. Okay. You got it.
- Now you guys heard it, he bet.

95
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,082
Sure, yeah.
I'll come to your temple.

96
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:01,749
I'll get breast implants, too.

97

Are you serious?

101
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:13,416
- No, that... I wasn't...
- You're going to temple.

00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,499
No, I can't.

103

- Come on.

105

- I'll see you in temple.
- What, are you kidding?

106
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:19,791
You don't expect me to go there.

107
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:21,166
We were joking.

108
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,082
- Come on. We made a fair bet.
- You didn't put up anything.

109
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:25,332
I just... What did you bet?
Nothing.

110
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:26,999
You're gonna look beautiful
with breasts.

111

- You're gonna look beautiful.
- Yeah.

112

You got a face for it.
You're gonna look great.

I can't go there,
I'll suffocate.

Or go into the fucking forest

00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:03,707
in front of me.

155
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:05,541
I'll work towards it.
You know, I...

156
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:08,874
We're gonna do this together.
We're gonna do it together.

157
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:10,416
- My man.
- Okay.

158
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:13,416
All right. Here we go,

159
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,791
little cup of joe
for the Woodman.

160
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,624
- Ah, thank you very much.
- Huh?

161
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:18,957
You know, I don't drink it much.

162
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:22,749
If I have coffee, which is rare,
I usually drink biodynamic

163
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:25,791
but I'll, uh, is this...
This isn't biodynamic product?

164
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:28,416
It's dynamic.

165
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,707
I don't know if it's biodynamic,
but it's definitely dynamic.

166
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:34,957
Do you know what? This is like
the sweetest digs, Larry.

167
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:36,791
Hey, you want some
of this cream in your coffee?

168
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:38,458
- I got it fresh from...
- Cream?

169
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,041
Is that cream, like cow cream?

170
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:46,249
You know what that does, Larry?

171
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:50,249
The cycle of violence
that creates that cream?

172
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:53,332
I mean, do you realize
the inherent cruelty in that?

173
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:56,583
What happens to the cow,
to the calf?

174
00:06:57,833 --> 00:07:00,332
Wait a second.

175
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:04,291
I didn't... I didn't get
that cream from a market.

176
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:05,707
Is that what you think? Oh, no!

177
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:09,624
I have a... I have a farm.
And a cow.

178
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:11,791
I... And the cow has a calf.

179
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:14,791
And after the calf is finished,
that's when I take it.

180
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:17,666
- That's extraordinary.
- You think I'd go into a market?

181
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,957
I'm not a monster.

182
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:23,291
And when I do go,
I'm cream-shaming.

183
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:26,207
- I cream-shamed too!
- You're a cream-shamer?

184
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:27,457
- Yeah!
- Oh, my God!

185
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:29,332
I'm cream-shaming all the time!

186
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:30,999
- Unbelievable!
- I thought I was gonna

187
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:34,207
cream-shame you now,
but I underestimated you.

188
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:36,041
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Come on.

189
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:38,791
I apologize, and where's the,
uh... Where's your farm?

190
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,666
It's outside the city, you know.

191
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:41,875
What's your cow's name?

192
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:44,374
- Jessie.
- Jessie?

193
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:46,041
Yeah. Jessie, oh, my God.

194
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:48,166
Woody, I got to tell you,
I just love that cow.

195
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,791
I just... I just love it.
Sometimes,

196
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:52,374
I'll just lie in the sun
and watch her chew that cud.

197
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:55,541
I don't know, just...
You know, I had pets growing up.

198
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:58,291
I had dogs, cats, whatever.

199
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:02,791
But I have never loved an animal
the way I love this cow.

200
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:05,791
- I just adore her.
- Could I meet Jessie?

201
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:08,207
Could I go to your farm
and meet Jessie?

202
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:10,582
I mean, this is right up
my alley.

203
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:15,332
You wanna meet Jessie?

204
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:17,999
I would love to.
What do you say?

205
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:20,249
Well, yeah, yeah. Sure. Yeah.

206
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,374
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

207
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:24,041
Okay. So I'm here a week.
What about Thursday?

208
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:26,416
Hmm. Nah.
Thursday is not good.

209
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,791
I got...
I gotta work on Thursday, yeah.

210
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:31,082
- Oh, okay. Friday?
- Friday's not good.

211
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:34,707
Saturday, you're not working,
and that's my last day here.

212
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:36,416
We'll do it Saturday, yeah?

213
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:42,874
Yeah. We'll do it.
We'll do it. Yeah. Sure.

214
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,041
- Great.
- Yeah.

215
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:46,207
- It's meant to be.
- Yeah.

216
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:48,624
But Larry,
let's talk about this script.

217
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:50,999
There's a few notes I have.

218
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:53,499
It's nothing.
It's not a page-one rewrite,

219
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:56,374
but let's start from page one.

220
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:58,332
♪

221
00:08:58,416 --> 00:09:00,207
Why would you tell him
you had a cow?

222
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:02,249
- That's nuts.
- Yeah. I was put on the spot.

223
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,707
You know, the whole thing
with the cream.

224
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:06,041
- You saw the Oscar speech.
- What do you know about cows?

225
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:08,749
I know nothing about cows.
I know the cow's name is Jessie.

226
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:10,624
You told him the cow's name
was Jessie.

227
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:12,624
He asked me what the name was,
and I said Jessie.

228
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:14,832
Jessie's the worst name
for a cow I've ever heard.

229
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:17,207
Fuck you.
That's a good name for a cow.

230
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:20,124
- What about Bessie?
- Okay. Bessie sounds made up.

231
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:21,666
That's like naming a dog Fido.

232
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:25,416
No. Jessie, you know
a young lady who skateboards.

233
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,999
That's who Jessie is.

234
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:29,249
- I really don't think you know what you're talking about.
- Oh, and you do?

235
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:31,416
By the way, no Jessie,
you can forget about Woody.

236
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,082
Hey. Oh, you know what?
I'm so glad you're here.

237
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:36,124
Thank you. And thank you too.

238
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:38,207
- For what?
- Taking the rabbi to golf.

239
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:40,124
- Oh.
- It was a mitzvah.

240
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:41,791
Don't you feel good
about yourself now?

241
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:42,916
No, I don't.

242
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,124
And of course, he roped me
into going to temple.

243
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:47,666
Aha! It'll be good
for your soul.

244
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,749
It'll be unbelievably boring.

245
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:53,207
And I'll regret every second
I spend there.

246
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:58,041
Do you not have any kind of
feeling of spirituality...

247
00:09:58,125 --> 00:09:59,457
...an inkling?

248
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:01,124
Some kind of spiritual...

249
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:02,582
All right. You know what?
Get the fuck out.

250
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:04,916
- Fuck you. Both of you.
- Hey, Susie!

251
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,999
In all seriousness.

252
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:10,582
Do you know anybody
who has a farm or a cow or...

253
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:13,624
What am I, Little House
on the fucking Prairie here?

254
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:15,457
I don't know cows and farms!

255
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:17,124
Maybe two farmers have come in
to mail

256
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:19,499
- a big package or something.
- They don't live around here,

257
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:20,541
farmers, Larry.

258
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:21,957
They have a couple
of big packages,

259
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:23,082
what are they sending out?

260
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:24,082
- Feed?
- Larry.

261
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:25,875
We're not gonna know
any farmers.

262
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,707
We don't know any cows.
What's the matter with you?

263
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:30,874
Ah, you're fucked.
You gotta find a cow.

264
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:33,457
♪

265
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:35,041
Okay, Larry. One last time.

266
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:36,541
- One?
- Yeah.

267
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:37,916
Or two?

268
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,207
Hmm.

269
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:41,750
- One?
- Mm-hmm.

270
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:44,041
- Two?
- Uh...

271
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:47,332
Just pick one,
whichever's clearer to you.

272
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:49,666
I, uh... Let me see that again.

273
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:50,791
- Okay.
- Uh-huh.

274
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:52,499
- One.
- Yeah.

275
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:54,166
- Two.
- Oh, boy. How...

276
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,999
Which one can you see better?

277
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:56,999
I know they're different.

278
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:58,666
I can see there's
a slight difference.

279
00:10:58,750 --> 00:10:59,707
- Yes.
- Yeah, but I can't tell

280
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:00,999
- which one's better.
- Well...

281
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:02,666
- I think two.
- Two?

282
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,499
- Eh!
- One more time? One?

283
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:05,957
- Yeah. One.
- Two?

284
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:06,957
Ah. You know what?

285
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,791
- Now I'm liking one.
- You like one?

286
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:10,166
- Yeah.
- Okay. One.

287
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,124
- Definitely one.
- All right. Let's go to three and four, huh.

288
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:14,082
- Three?
- Yeah.

289
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:15,249
- Or four?
- Four.

290
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:16,749
- Four?
- Oh, yeah. Four.

291
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:18,166
That was fast, okay.

292
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:20,416
No. Hold it.
Let me see it again.

293
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,416
Okay. Three.

294
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,999
Three is really growing on me.

295
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:24,416
Here's four again.

296
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,582
Eh, uh... Let me see it again.

297
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:27,916
- Three.
- Yeah.

298
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,999
- Four.
- Okay.

299
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:30,374
This is like a trick
of some kind.

300
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:31,666
Promise we're not tricking you.

301
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:34,541
I think actually three
is one and two is four.

302
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:36,208
- Am I right? Huh?
- What...

303
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:38,791
W... No. No.

304
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:41,457
Just three or four.
What's the first instinct?

305
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:42,624
Who gets the tie?

306
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:44,707
There are no ties in optometry,
you got to pick one.

307
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:45,874
- Do me just one favor.
- Uh-huh.

308
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:47,707
Can you go back to one and two?
I think I want two.

309
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:49,374
- Okay.
- That's why I'm having trouble

310
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:50,582
- with three and four.
- Oh.

311
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:52,457
'Cause I can't get one and two
out of my head.

312
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:54,291
'Cause I think I made a mistake
with one.

313
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:55,666
- Okay. We're back at one now.
- Yeah.

314
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,791
- Okay. Now, let me see two.
- Okay.

315
00:11:57,875 --> 00:11:59,457
- Two.
- Okay. Yeah. Two, yeah.

316
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:01,624
Two! Perfect.
Let's leave this for a second.

317
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:03,916
Let's walk away from this,
let this settle.

318
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,499
- Okay.
- Here's some info.

319
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:07,166
'Cause that was
a lot of decisions.

320
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,457
That's been my problem
in my life.

321
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:10,291
I don't stay
with the first instinct.

322
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:11,749
I go to the second instinct.

323
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:13,749
Hey, by the way,
can you believe this weird rally

324
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,249
that's going on in Westwood
this week?

325
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:16,769
Yeah. What the hell
is that? A hate rally?

326
00:12:16,853 --> 00:12:17,396
So offensive.

327
00:12:17,481 --> 00:12:18,499
What are they doing? Yeah.

328
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:21,041
I mean, free speech, fine.
But this is fucking crazy.

329
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:22,874
Freedom of speech,
that's so overrated.

330
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:24,207
There shouldn't be
freedom of speech,

331
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:25,707
unless it's me, of course.

332
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:27,416
And that should've been
in the constitution.

333
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,582
- Freedom of speech...
- Sure.

334
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:30,791
...for Larry David.
Everybody else said "Ask Larry."

335
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,791
Let me dilate your eyes, okay?
Wanna take your glasses off?

336
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:33,832
- Sure.
- All right.

337
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:34,999
Let's do this real quick.

338
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:37,082
You'll only be blurry
for about a half-hour.

339
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:38,957
Here we go, boop and boop.

340
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:41,582
Sure you've done that before.
All right.

341
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:44,124
Nurse is gonna come in
and run a couple more tests.

342
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:45,582
I just wanna see
one more thing here.

343
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:47,207
We'll get you a new
prescription, okay?

344
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:48,416
All right. You know what?

345
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,832
Uh. One. Should've been one.

346
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:52,083
- You just hang tight.
- One, definitely.

347
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:58,125
♪

348
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,249
Stay strong, man.

349
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:20,666
- Son of a...
- Geez!

350
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,041
- ...bitch!
- Oh, my gosh.

351
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:26,249
- Dude, what are you doing man?
- Sorry. I'm so sorry. So sorry.

352
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:27,874
Look at this. Come on, dude.

353
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:29,874
I'm so sorry.
I just came from the eye doctor.

354
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:31,457
They dilated my pupils.

355
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:33,332
And everything's kinda...
I didn't see you.

356
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:35,832
Well, look at that.
This is totally ruined.

357
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:37,916
I can't believe
this is happening.

358
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,499
I'm screwed for today.

359
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:42,583
What am I supposed to do?
You can't wear that anymore!

360
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,499
Would you go to an event
like this?

361
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:48,999
- Oh, yeah. You got the rally.
- Yeah. I got the rally today.

362
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:50,419
You can't wear that to a rally.

363
00:13:50,504 --> 00:13:52,374
- No, I can't.
- Are you kidding? No. No way.

364
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:53,582
Can't you just get a sheet?

365
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,207
No, I don't wanna wear
a fucking sheet.

366
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:58,541
It's not a sheet anyway.
This is a robe. Feel it.

367
00:13:58,625 --> 00:13:59,749
- Ah.
- That's not...

368
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:01,124
I always thought it was a sheet.

369
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:03,207
I can't afford to go
get another one of these.

370
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:04,624
But what about just temporarily?

371
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:07,041
- Put a sheet on just for today.
- No, I'm not gonna wear a sheet!

372
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:08,374
It's like a spare tire,
you know.

373
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:10,499
No, I can't do that.
That's total amateur, man.

374
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,082
Yeah. Yeah.
You gotta get that cleaned.

375
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:13,749
- It's really a shame.
- Yeah.

376
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:15,249
I'll tell you what I could do.

377
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:17,541
Take it to the dry cleaners,
they can get that out.

378
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:21,374
But I've got a rally in Tucson
and one in Santa Fe coming up.

379
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:22,874
And those things
are the real deal.

380
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:24,166
- They're the big ones.
- Okay.

381
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,846
- So when do you need it by?
- Two days.

382
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:27,846
How about this, you know?
For the rally today,

383
00:14:27,931 --> 00:14:30,416
you know, you go robe-less,
it's not the end of the world.

384
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,874
And then, um, you'll have
that robe spanking clean

385
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:35,332
- in two days.
- You promise?

386
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:36,957
I don't know, why do they make
these white anyway?

387
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:39,041
They stain so easily, you guys,
you're out all the time

388
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:41,499
in the fields, with the burning,
and the ashes,

389
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:44,249
you must spend a lot of money
at the cleaners for this thing.

390
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:45,666
Well, it's tradition.

391
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,332
- You know tradition?
- Of course.

392
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:49,832
"Who, day and night,
must scramble for a living,

393
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:53,041
feed the wife and children,
say his daily prayers?"

394
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:54,291
- Yes.
- "Who has the right,

395
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:57,166
as master of the house,
to have the final word at home?

396
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:59,207
The papa! Tradition."

397
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:00,666
Tradition. Yeah, exactly.

398
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:03,124
If I was starting
your organization,

399
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:05,582
I would've
opted for a black robe.

400
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:07,749
You can't see black
in the middle of the night.

401
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:10,291
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Right, right.

402
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:11,624
- You wanna see the white.
- Got you.

403
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:13,499
I'll give you my phone,
you write your number in here.

404
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:15,082
- Okay.
- Just put it in there.

405
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:17,249
- Hurrah!
- Hurrah!

406
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,916
- Stay strong!
- Stay strong, brother.

407
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,999
White is right!

408
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:21,332
- You should call me...
- Great.

409
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:23,582
- Thank you so much.
- Okay. Sure.

410
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:25,624
Yeah. Let's get this, uh,
taken care of.

411
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:27,124
Again, I... My apologies.

412
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:29,999
And you have my word,
on my honor.

413
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:32,874
You will have this robe
for your hate rallies

414
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:34,332
in Tucson and Santa Fe.

415
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:36,457
All right. Hey, thanks.
I really appreciate it.

416
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:37,666
- Yeah. Sure.
- I really appreciate it.

417
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:41,082
Yeah. And hey, uh,
no starch, no crease, please.

418
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:43,332
- No starch in the robe?
- Right.

419

♪

420
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:49,957
- Good morning!
- Hey, good morning.

421
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:51,291
How can I help ya?

422
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:52,874
I spilled some coffee on this.
I'd like to get it cleaned.

423
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:54,832
- Sure. Let's have a look.
- Hey, there's nothing to see.

424
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:56,291
Just throw it in the bin.

425
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:57,624
No, no, no. Let me see it.
Let's see how bad it is.

426
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:58,504
Just throw it in the bin.

427
00:15:58,589 --> 00:16:00,149
It's good to get a sense...

428
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:04,916
- Is that what I think it is?
- Yeah.

429
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,207
- Yeah. It's not mine. It's...
- Well, let's hope.

430
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:10,374
Yeah. It's... Some Klansmen
are over,

431
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:11,707
and I spilled coffee on it.

432
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:13,874
It's my responsibility,
and I feel like, you know,

433
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:16,207
- I spill, I clean.
- So if it's your responsibility,

434
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:18,582
then it's your responsibility
to take it somewhere else

435
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:20,374
because I don't want it
in my store,

436
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:22,166
I don't wanna clean it,
I don't wanna touch it.

437
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,707
I get the reluctance, I do.

438
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:25,832
But let me just say this,
as far as Klansmen go,

439
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:28,374
he's a decent Klansman,
yeah.

440
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:30,166
- A decent Klansman...
- Yeah.

441
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:33,041
- ...is a Klansman.
- True. True.

442
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:35,166
But, you see
what you're doing here?

443
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:37,332
What you're doing
is what they're doing.

444
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:38,666
You don't wanna have
anything to do

445
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:41,082
with this particular group,
that's their mantra.

446
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,749
And now
that's what you're doing.

447
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:44,457
- This group hates me.
- Yeah.

448
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:46,082
- I'm a Jew. They hate me.
- I understand.

449
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:47,207
- See this cheek?
- Mm-hmm.

450
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:48,999
All right. Look. See?
See what I'm doing?

451
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:51,249
I'm turning that cheek.
Turn the cheek!

452
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:53,874
Turn your cheek!
Let's not be like them.

453
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:56,374
Let's show them
that we're different.

454
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:57,957
We don't discriminate.

455
00:16:58,041 --> 00:17:00,291
- Okay.
- Thank you. Thank you.

456
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:02,124
I really don't like this,
but I'll do it.

457
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:03,999
I really appreciate that.

458
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:07,666
And, um, is there any way
I could get this robe, uh,

459
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,874
by tomorrow, he's got
big rallies coming up

460
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:11,541
in Santa Fe and Tucson.

461
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:14,291
- Three o' clock, tomorrow.
- By the way, you know anyone

462
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:16,874
who... owns a cow?

463
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:18,874
We're in the middle of the city,
there's no cows.

464
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:21,999
If someone comes in
and they look a little farm-ish,

465
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,457
if you have
a farm-ish customer...

466
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:25,957
Yeah, I don't think that happens
too often, but okay.

467
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:28,124
Thank you so much.
Really appreciate it.

468
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:30,082
Uh, you know what?
I don't have any change.

469
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:31,249
You know, it takes bills.

470
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:33,707
Yeah, it's hard to stuff
them in there.

471
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:35,124
It's very narrow, I see.

472
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:36,832
- Not that hard.
- By the way,

473
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:38,124
no starch, no crease.

474
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:39,583
See you tomorrow.

475
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:42,083
Absolutely disgusting.

476
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:47,916
The blowing of the shofar
symbolizes many things.

477
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,832
In the Torah, it is said
the blowing of the shofar

478
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:52,916
is a call to assemble
for battle.

479
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,041
- Hey.
- Hey.

480
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:55,499
It's a High Holy Day miracle,

481
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:57,124
- look who's here.
- Yeah.

482
00:17:57,208 --> 00:18:00,124
...intolerance and hate
that are amassing right here

483
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:01,624
in our very city.

484
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:04,457
A mere few blocks away,
people are gathering

485
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:08,499
to spread their lies
and disinformation and venom.

486
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:10,416
Can you believe this, there's
a hate group in Westwood?

487
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,957
Yeah. I ran into one,
I spilled coffee on his robe,

488
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:14,582
I had to bring it
to the dry cleaner.

489
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:16,166
You had a confrontation
with the hate group?

490
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:17,499
- Yes.
- What kind of robe was it,

491
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:19,874
- like a big, white robe?
- First of all, it's not white.

492
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:21,624
It's more like bone or ecru.

493
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:24,041
Huh! How was the eye doctor?
You see Heidi?

494
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:26,582
- Yes. She's a great doctor.
- Great doctor.

495
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:27,791
God.

496
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:30,416
- Charming. Really attractive.
- Yeah, thank you.

497
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,332
I knew you would be happy when
you saw her, she's terrific.

498
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:35,791
However, there's something
I have to tell you.

499
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:36,832
Okay.

500
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:38,874
It's difficult for me
to even bring this up.

501
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:41,666
- Bring what up?
- When the exam was over,

502
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:44,375
she dropped a Pirate's Booty
on the floor.

503
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,499
Didn't pick it up.

504
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:50,249
Did you see her drop
the Pirate's Booty?

505
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:53,916
I saw her do it. I saw her look
at the Pirate's Booty,

506
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,791
make the decision
not to pick it up

507
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:57,041
and walk out of the room.

508
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:58,874
Maybe she got it later.
She could've been embarrassed.

509
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:00,166
No, she didn't.

510
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:01,457
- You know why?
- Why?

511
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:02,791
'Cause I picked it up.

512
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,499
Yeah. I don't like
what that says about her.

513
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:06,582
No, I don't like it.

514
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:09,166
It's indicative
of a moral compass gone askew.

515
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,707
That's terrible.

516
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:12,082
I know, it's awful.

517
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:14,291
What do I do? I can't just sit
with this, it bothers me now.

518
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:15,374
I don't know what you should do.

519
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:16,999
Maybe you could bring it up
with her.

520
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:18,457
Keep me out of it. Could never...

521
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:21,499
His girlfriend, the optometrist,
dropped a Pirate's Booty

522
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:23,207
on the floor. Didn't pick it up.

523
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:24,541
It's not a good thing
to drop the booty

524
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:25,624
- and not pick it up.
- Not good.

525
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:26,832
- So what?
- What do you mean "So what"?

526
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,124
There's a sense
of entitlement there,

527
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,291
it's not a good quality.

528
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:31,041
Let it go.
You're so fucking judgmental.

529
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:32,125
Please rise.

530
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:34,832
Do you like Pirate Booty?

531
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:36,874
- No, it's disgusting.
- It's not a good snack.

532
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:38,291
I don't like a cheesy snack,
do you?

533
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:40,457
No, if I'm gonna have anything,
I'm gonna have a potato chip.

534
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:42,582
- A cheesy snack is not good.
- No!

535
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:45,624
All right.

536
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:52,707
Man, he's good.

537
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:54,125
- Unbelievable.
- Yeah.

538
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:58,416
Thank you all for coming.

539
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:01,291
<i>- Shanah tovah.
- Shanah tovah.</i>

540
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:02,541
I can tell you this,

541
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:04,374
they're not gonna be seeing
me again anytime soon.

542
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:05,957
You didn't enjoy,
you didn't have fun?

543
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:07,124
Rabbi Freedman.

544
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:10,416
Oh, my God, that was so moving.
Just terrific.

545
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,082
- Thank you.
- Hello.

546
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:13,707
I wasn't sure
you were gonna make it.

547
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:15,249
Come on, I'm a man of my word.
Are you kidding?

548
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:16,624
- Yes, you are.
- Very nice service,

549
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:19,457
and by the way,
fantastic on that shofar.

550
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:21,041
- Oh, thank you.
- He's pretty amazing.

551
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:22,707
- I don't know how you do it.
- Just blow.

552
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:24,999
I've tried 50 times,
I've never ever been able

553
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:26,291
to get anything out of it.

554
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:27,582
Why don't you give it a try?

555
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:29,249
No, it's ridiculous.
I can't do it.

556
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:31,499
How do you know? You might be
a regular Dizzy Gillespie.

557
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:33,082
I can't. Okay,
I'll give it a try.

558
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:35,916
- He's ready for this.
- With this. Do you... huh, huh.

559
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,124
Nothing personal.

560
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:38,916
This is quite a lead up.
You'd better really be able

561
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,041
to blow that thing.

562
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:43,416
This is crazy.
It's an exercise in futility.

563
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,749
Blow that thing.

564
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:50,041
You're a master in the making,
I can tell.

565
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:52,499
- Ridiculous.
- Please keep it as a gift.

566
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:54,999
What? I can't possibly
take this from you.

567
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:56,999
It was such a lovely day
on the golf course.

568
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:59,499
- I want you to have this.
- All right. Okay.

569
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:01,082
- Thank you so much.
- Enjoy.

570
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:02,499
- Thank you.
- It's good to see you here.

571
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:03,832
Nice to see you guys.

572
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:05,791
That's a nice gesture.
You'll have that forever.

573
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:08,999
Oh, please. I'm never gonna pick
this up for the rest of my life.

574
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:12,125
♪

575
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,999
- Hey, guys, how you doin'?
- Doing swell. How are you?

576
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:20,082
Great. Cannot complain.

577
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:21,916
- It's so beautiful out.
- Oh, gorgeous day.

578
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,082
Yeah? You got any fun plans
for today?

579
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:25,957
Thinking about having
my leg amputated.

580
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:28,249
Oh, well, good luck.

581
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:30,833
- You find everything okay?
- Yes, we did, yeah.

582
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:41,208
I would like to, uh...

583
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:44,166
Go ahead.

584
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:45,332
...buy this watermelon.

585
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:46,957
I'm sorry, I didn't hear
what you said.

586
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:51,125
He said he'd like to buy
the watermelon.

587
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:53,499
- Okay.
- And that's okay.

588
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:56,207
- Yeah.
- Because it's not a crime

589
00:21:56,291 --> 00:22:00,499
for a Black man
to like watermelon, is it?

590
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:03,416
Sir, do you like watermelon?

591
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,832
It's really none of my business,
man, it's...

592
00:22:05,916 --> 00:22:07,416
Just doing my thing, you know.

593
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,875
Tell me the truth.
Do you like watermelon?

594
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:13,666
Yeah, I like watermelon.

595
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:16,082
- You like it a lot?
- I do.

596
00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:17,416
I like watermelon.

597
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,124
I like it. I like watermelon!

598
00:22:19,208 --> 00:22:21,582
He likes watermelon!
Of course, you like it,

599
00:22:21,666 --> 00:22:22,749
because it's delicious!

600
00:22:22,833 --> 00:22:24,082
- Right!
- Why wouldn't you like it?

601
00:22:24,166 --> 00:22:25,416
- Thank you!
- You know what?

602
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,749
Get yourself a watermelon,
on me.

603
00:22:27,833 --> 00:22:30,666
- I will!
- And you know what else?

604
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,666
I love gefilte fish.

605
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,957
Yeah, you heard me,
gefilte fish.

606
00:22:35,041 --> 00:22:38,082
And I'm gonna have it
with a smear of cream cheese

607
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:39,499
on a bagel.

608
00:22:39,583 --> 00:22:43,957
And I might even have
some herring.

609
00:22:44,041 --> 00:22:47,166
And that's okay too.
Ring up that watermelon.

610
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:49,749
- Ring up the gefilte fish.
- All right.

611
00:22:49,833 --> 00:22:50,916
My man.

612
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:57,666
Yeah, I've looked everywhere.

613
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:59,833
I can't find the robe.
It's lost.

614
00:23:02,208 --> 00:23:04,916
- Okay, that's bullshit.
- It's lost.

615
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,291
- Give me the robe.
- You know what?

616
00:23:06,375 --> 00:23:08,499
If you're gonna give
an important job like that

617
00:23:08,583 --> 00:23:11,041
to a member of an inferior race,
you gotta expect us

618
00:23:11,125 --> 00:23:12,124
to screw it up.

619
00:23:12,208 --> 00:23:13,832
I'm in a lot of trouble now
because of you.

620
00:23:13,916 --> 00:23:14,957
A lot of trouble.

621
00:23:15,041 --> 00:23:16,499
I thought you said
he was a very decent Klansman.

622
00:23:16,583 --> 00:23:18,791
He is a decent Klansman,
but he's still a Klansman!

623
00:23:18,875 --> 00:23:21,916
He's got rallies coming up
in Santa Fe and Tucson.

624
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,666
He's not gonna have his robe.
He's not gonna be happy!

625
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:25,916
That's a real shame.

626
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,291
♪

627
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:39,541
What do you mean he lost it?

628
00:23:39,625 --> 00:23:41,332
Yeah, said he lost it.

629
00:23:41,416 --> 00:23:43,291
- I fucking trusted you.
- Yeah.

630
00:23:43,375 --> 00:23:44,416
You go to the cleaners,

631
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,166
you give them your clothes
to get cleaned...

632
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:48,207
- Yeah.
- ...and they're supposed to give it back to you.

633
00:23:48,291 --> 00:23:49,832
They're supposed to give it
back to you.

634
00:23:49,916 --> 00:23:51,041
It's a... It's a disgrace.

635
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:54,124
Well, you can't go to fucking
Walmart and buy a robe.

636
00:23:54,208 --> 00:23:55,582
- Yeah.
- So, what are you

637
00:23:55,666 --> 00:23:56,999
gonna do about it?

638
00:23:57,083 --> 00:23:58,707
That's not my problem.

639
00:23:58,791 --> 00:23:59,832
You're the one
who took the robe.

640
00:23:59,916 --> 00:24:00,957
Yeah, it's my responsibility.

641
00:24:01,041 --> 00:24:02,625
How are you gonna fix this,
Larry?

642
00:24:04,916 --> 00:24:05,958
You know what?

643
00:24:06,875 --> 00:24:10,291
My friend's wife
is a seamstress.

644
00:24:10,375 --> 00:24:12,832
You can't believe the stuff
that she can sew.

645
00:24:12,916 --> 00:24:14,832
- Yeah?
- She kind of owes me a favor.

646
00:24:14,916 --> 00:24:18,791
Still, it's not gonna be
an easy ask, but...

647
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:20,582
I think I can get her to do it.

648
00:24:20,666 --> 00:24:23,374
- Like a custom job?
- A custom job.

649
00:24:23,458 --> 00:24:24,541
You think she can get it done.

650
00:24:24,625 --> 00:24:26,457
She can get it done.
She can get it done, yeah.

651
00:24:26,541 --> 00:24:27,874
I've never had
a custom one done.

652
00:24:27,958 --> 00:24:31,457
She could do it. You will be
the envy of every Klansman!

653
00:24:31,541 --> 00:24:33,541
Huh, you like that?

654
00:24:33,625 --> 00:24:34,749
They'll look at you, they'll go,

655
00:24:34,833 --> 00:24:36,041
"Hey, what, did you see
Joe's robe?

656
00:24:36,125 --> 00:24:37,999
Look at Joe's robe,
where do I get one of those?"

657
00:24:38,083 --> 00:24:41,041
You'll get invited to the
Grand Wizard's house for dinner.

658
00:24:41,125 --> 00:24:42,291
That's my prediction.

659
00:24:42,375 --> 00:24:44,082
I've never been to his house.
If I could go to dinner,

660
00:24:44,166 --> 00:24:47,332
I'd say that comes out
to be a pretty fair trade.

661
00:24:47,416 --> 00:24:49,416
- Yeah.
- Great, great.

662
00:24:51,791 --> 00:24:53,500
That'd be awesome, man.

663
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:04,625
Maybe you could do me
a small favor.

664
00:25:06,625 --> 00:25:08,082
Anyway, I hope
I'm not disturbing you.

665
00:25:08,166 --> 00:25:10,249
No, I'm just making dinner.
You know, the usual.

666
00:25:10,333 --> 00:25:12,457
You know, I'm not one
for pop-ins, you know.

667
00:25:12,541 --> 00:25:15,541
- You pop in all the time.
- Eh? You know.

668
00:25:15,625 --> 00:25:17,124
By the way,
I cannot stop thinking

669
00:25:17,208 --> 00:25:19,207
- about that banner.
- Uh, yeah.

670
00:25:19,291 --> 00:25:21,832
That was an incredible
work of art.

671
00:25:21,916 --> 00:25:23,874
That makes me so happy
that you appreciate it.

672
00:25:23,958 --> 00:25:26,832
How could I not? I wouldn't be
a human being, for God's sake!

673
00:25:26,916 --> 00:25:28,582
With all due modesty,
it's a masterpiece,

674
00:25:28,666 --> 00:25:29,707
I mean, it's amazing.

675
00:25:29,791 --> 00:25:31,207
If I had a talent like that,
I'd be shouting it

676
00:25:31,291 --> 00:25:33,499
from the rooftops,
"Hey, look at me everybody."

677
00:25:33,583 --> 00:25:35,249
You have that need.
I'm more secure.

678
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:36,207
Yeah.

679
00:25:36,291 --> 00:25:37,707
Thanks again for golfing
with the rabbi.

680
00:25:37,791 --> 00:25:40,624
Oh, what a delightful man.

681
00:25:40,708 --> 00:25:42,207
I knew you would like him.

682
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:43,749
- And fun to play with.
- Fun.

683
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:45,457
Sense of humor,
just like you said.

684
00:25:45,541 --> 00:25:47,124
- Right.
- And hip, whoo!

685
00:25:47,208 --> 00:25:49,707
- Yeah.
- Those four and a half hours

686
00:25:49,791 --> 00:25:51,124
just flew by.

687
00:25:51,208 --> 00:25:53,666
Anyway, I was thinking
maybe you could sew

688
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,416
something for me.

689
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,166
Uh, I'm so touched.

690
00:25:57,250 --> 00:25:58,457
You'll do it?

691
00:25:58,541 --> 00:26:00,374
Well, depends on what it is,
I am not capable of everything.

692
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:02,082
I don't think it's that
difficult.

693
00:26:02,166 --> 00:26:03,582
I think you could
knock it off...

694
00:26:03,666 --> 00:26:04,624
You have something in mind?

695
00:26:04,708 --> 00:26:06,041
- Yeah, yes, I do, actually.
- What is it?

696
00:26:06,125 --> 00:26:07,499
It's not for me.
It's for a friend of mine.

697
00:26:07,583 --> 00:26:09,082
- What is it?
- It's kind of a robe.

698
00:26:09,166 --> 00:26:10,832
What kind of a robe,
like a bathrobe?

699
00:26:10,916 --> 00:26:12,624
No, more like a sheet-y
kind of thing.

700
00:26:12,708 --> 00:26:14,582
Sheet, like a kaftan,
kind of a...

701
00:26:14,666 --> 00:26:16,749
- It's kaftan-ish, yeah.
- Uh-huh.

702
00:26:16,833 --> 00:26:19,582
- There's a hood and...
- Is it for a man or a woman?

703
00:26:19,666 --> 00:26:21,874
- Oh, it's for a man.
- What kind of a man?

704
00:26:21,958 --> 00:26:24,916
- A Klansman.
- What do you mean, a Klansman?

705
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:26,707
Yeah, a Ku Klux Klansman.

706
00:26:26,791 --> 00:26:27,999
- What?
- Yeah.

707
00:26:28,083 --> 00:26:29,457
What are you, fucking crazy?

708
00:26:29,541 --> 00:26:31,499
I could see how
you would react like that, okay?

709
00:26:31,583 --> 00:26:33,082
How do you even know a Klansman?

710
00:26:33,166 --> 00:26:35,416
I spilled coffee on his robe,
you know, I feel like

711
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,499
it's my responsibility
to replace the robe.

712
00:26:37,583 --> 00:26:38,957
The dry cleaner said he lost it.

713
00:26:39,041 --> 00:26:41,332
Larry, it goes against
everything I believe in.

714
00:26:41,416 --> 00:26:43,166
Next thing you're gonna do
is tell me some of them

715
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:44,499
are very good people.

716
00:26:44,583 --> 00:26:46,499
I did play golf with the rabbi.

717
00:26:46,583 --> 00:26:49,291
He was the slowest player
I've ever been with.

718
00:26:49,375 --> 00:26:50,916
You do owe me a favor.

719
00:26:56,166 --> 00:26:57,624
I'll do it.

720
00:26:57,708 --> 00:26:59,749
- Thank you so much.
- Just go. Just go.

721
00:26:59,833 --> 00:27:01,749
And by the way,
don't worry about the pointy hat

722
00:27:01,833 --> 00:27:03,999
because that didn't get
coffee on it.

723
00:27:04,083 --> 00:27:05,999
- Oh, some good things.
- Yeah. Also,

724
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:07,457
don't make the sleeves
too floppy

725
00:27:07,541 --> 00:27:10,041
because they can get burned
when he's lighting the torches.

726
00:27:11,833 --> 00:27:13,707
I'm sorry you weren't here
the other night.

727
00:27:13,791 --> 00:27:16,291
We had a fabulous square dance.

728
00:27:16,375 --> 00:27:18,541
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah, right in the barn.

729
00:27:18,625 --> 00:27:19,749
- You square...
- Yeah.

730
00:27:19,833 --> 00:27:21,582
I'm picturing you
square dancing.

731
00:27:21,666 --> 00:27:22,957
Oh, yeah, yeah!
Grab your partner,

732
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:25,707
do-si-do, oh, yeah.
I do-si, yeah.

733
00:27:28,291 --> 00:27:30,041
Oh, hey, hey, look at this.

734
00:27:30,125 --> 00:27:31,749
- Look at Jessie.
- Oh.

735
00:27:31,833 --> 00:27:33,999
I'd like you to meet
my friend, Woody.

736
00:27:34,083 --> 00:27:35,457
- Jessie.
- Huh?

737
00:27:35,541 --> 00:27:37,249
You're a beautiful mother.

738
00:27:37,333 --> 00:27:39,374
- She's my baby.
- Oh, yeah.

739
00:27:39,458 --> 00:27:41,166
Do you ever milk her?

740
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:43,332
Joe. Do I milk?

741
00:27:43,416 --> 00:27:45,874
- Joe, tell him about my...
- Larry milk.

742
00:27:45,958 --> 00:27:46,916
- Huh?
- He milk.

743
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,374
- Oh, yeah, I milk.
- I mean, she looks like

744
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:51,374
she's ready to pop. Let's pull
up a stool and get it going.

745
00:27:51,458 --> 00:27:57,416
Uh, it's a great idea,
but I milked so much last week.

746
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,707
I got milky fingers,
you know what that is?

747
00:27:59,791 --> 00:28:00,916
I never heard of that.

748
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,749
It's a farm term,
it means when you milk too much

749
00:28:02,833 --> 00:28:06,041
and your fingers get very stiff
and you can't close them up.

750
00:28:06,125 --> 00:28:08,416
And what about the calf?
What's the calf's name?

751
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:12,416
The calf? Oh, yeah,
that's, uh, that's Rebecca.

752
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:15,832
Oh, it's very, uh,
gendery-bendery of you

753
00:28:15,916 --> 00:28:18,457
to have a male calf
with a female name.

754
00:28:18,541 --> 00:28:21,957
You know, uh, we don't see
gender here on this farm.

755
00:28:22,041 --> 00:28:23,207
We're kind of a woke farm.

756
00:28:23,291 --> 00:28:25,707
We're the most progressive
farm in the valley, Woody.

757
00:28:25,791 --> 00:28:26,999
- Are you?
- Oh, yeah.

758
00:28:27,083 --> 00:28:29,874
You know, Joe here, uh,
he's got the pictures

759
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:32,374
of Nancy Pelosi on his tractor.

760
00:28:36,541 --> 00:28:38,582
- It's funny. Yeah.
- Yeah.

761
00:28:38,666 --> 00:28:40,166
So anyway, you know,
we should, uh,

762
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:42,124
we should probably take off.
I could...

763
00:28:42,208 --> 00:28:43,707
If you want some of those apples
back there,

764
00:28:43,791 --> 00:28:46,416
Joe can rustle you up a bunch
if you want, to take home.

765
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,457
Right, I won't let the Jew
charge you.

766
00:28:48,541 --> 00:28:50,457
Oh.

767
00:28:50,541 --> 00:28:53,082
We harass each other
all the time, yeah.

768
00:28:53,166 --> 00:28:54,374
Well, what do you call him?

769
00:28:54,458 --> 00:28:56,332
I just call him
a racist cocksucker.

770
00:28:59,916 --> 00:29:02,707
- It's good stuff.
- It works. It works.

771
00:29:02,791 --> 00:29:03,832
It's life on the ranch.

772
00:29:03,916 --> 00:29:04,874
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

773
00:29:04,958 --> 00:29:07,249
Wow. What an honor to meet you.

774
00:29:07,333 --> 00:29:09,916
- Bye Jessie, yeah.
- You gonna pet her goodbye?

775
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
I gotta have lunch in a minute.

776
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:22,999
You okay?

777
00:29:23,083 --> 00:29:25,374
Yeah, I'm great. Great.

778
00:29:25,458 --> 00:29:26,832
Freddy.

779
00:29:26,916 --> 00:29:30,582
Okay. What's wrong? What?
What's going on?

780
00:29:30,666 --> 00:29:32,624
Now that you've mentioned
something,

781
00:29:32,708 --> 00:29:35,124
someone that we both know...

782
00:29:35,208 --> 00:29:36,832
- Mm-hmm.
- ...was in your office.

783
00:29:36,916 --> 00:29:38,041
Okay.

784
00:29:38,125 --> 00:29:40,457
And said that you were, um,
eating some Pirate Booty.

785
00:29:40,541 --> 00:29:42,582
And that the Pirate Booty
fell on the ground.

786
00:29:42,666 --> 00:29:44,749
And that you made a decision
not to pick the Pirate Booty

787
00:29:44,833 --> 00:29:47,457
up off the floor,
and it's been bothering me.

788
00:29:47,541 --> 00:29:49,541
- Is this a joke?
- It's a simple question.

789
00:29:49,625 --> 00:29:51,082
Did you drop the Pirate Booty
or did you not?

790
00:29:51,166 --> 00:29:54,707
No, but who would tell you
something so insane?

791
00:29:54,791 --> 00:29:56,666
- The who's not important.
- It's very important.

792
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:58,374
- What? It was a dog walker...
- Freddy, who?

793
00:29:58,458 --> 00:30:00,249
It was a mutual friend.
What does it matter?

794
00:30:00,333 --> 00:30:01,666
- It was Larry David.
- Oh, for fuck's sake.

795
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:03,416
Okay? He said to me
that he saw you in the office

796
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,541
- you were eating...
- Larry David,

797
00:30:04,625 --> 00:30:05,916
he couldn't choose
between one and two.

798
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,707
- Why is this about...
- One or two.

799
00:30:07,791 --> 00:30:08,874
Did you drop the Pirate Booty?

800
00:30:08,958 --> 00:30:11,457
- He is magoo.
- But what's his motivation?

801
00:30:11,541 --> 00:30:12,541
What would he gain from it?

802
00:30:12,625 --> 00:30:14,124
Freddy, don't you think
if I notice something

803
00:30:14,208 --> 00:30:15,624
that fell on the ground,
I would pick it up?

804
00:30:15,708 --> 00:30:17,124
- It's ridiculous.
- Yeah, one would hope.

805
00:30:17,208 --> 00:30:18,416
So I'm gonna ask you
one more time.

806
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,416
- That's it.
- Freddy?

807
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,208
- Did you drop the Pirate Booty?
- Yes.

808
00:30:21,958 --> 00:30:22,999
- Okay.
- Yes.

809
00:30:23,083 --> 00:30:25,041
I dropped the fucking
Pirate's Booty, okay.

810
00:30:25,125 --> 00:30:26,874
Wasn't a big deal,
we have a team of people.

811
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:27,832
I was busy.

812
00:30:27,916 --> 00:30:29,041
This is where
we should've started.

813
00:30:29,125 --> 00:30:30,291
Didn't care then,
don't care now.

814
00:30:30,375 --> 00:30:31,582
Yeah, and you know what?

815
00:30:31,666 --> 00:30:33,166
- Didn't wanna pick it up.
- Look what you put me through.

816
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:35,332
- Wait, I put you through?
- Yeah.

817
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:36,749
This is all fucking Larry David.

818
00:30:36,833 --> 00:30:38,416
No, it's not.
Thank God for Larry David

819
00:30:38,523 --> 00:30:39,743
because you'll grow from this.

820
00:30:39,828 --> 00:30:41,416
Ew, you know what,
I'm growing now.

821
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,874
I'm outta here. Oh, God.

822
00:30:43,958 --> 00:30:46,124
And you know what?
You know what?

823
00:30:46,208 --> 00:30:48,624
That's not gonna solve anything.
That's not gonna solve anything.

824
00:30:48,708 --> 00:30:50,374
This is how you handle...
Okay, all right.

825
00:30:50,458 --> 00:30:53,249
I see it now. I don't know
how I didn't see it before.

826
00:30:53,333 --> 00:30:54,749
I hope someone can pick that up.

827
00:30:54,833 --> 00:30:57,166
By the way, super great way
of handling this.

828
00:30:59,291 --> 00:31:01,374
- How about that?
- Uh, fantastic.

829
00:31:01,458 --> 00:31:03,166
- Right?
- Thank you so much.

830
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:06,374
- The grapes, the apples.
- Of course, of course.

831
00:31:06,458 --> 00:31:09,249
And I'm looking forward
to talking about Uncle Mo.

832
00:31:09,333 --> 00:31:12,082
That's very exciting.
Thank you.

833
00:31:12,166 --> 00:31:14,249
You got it made out here,
you know.

834
00:31:14,333 --> 00:31:16,041
It's a pleasure there,
Woody.

835
00:31:16,125 --> 00:31:17,541
- Thank you, Joe.
- Yeah.

836
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:18,832
You take care of yourself, man.

837
00:31:18,916 --> 00:31:21,791
- Yeah, you too, man.
- Thank you, sir. Oops.

838
00:31:21,875 --> 00:31:24,291
Good man. These are good.
I'll see you guys.

839
00:31:24,375 --> 00:31:26,541
Hey, what... Whoa.
What the fuck?

840
00:31:26,625 --> 00:31:27,541
What?

841
00:31:27,625 --> 00:31:29,000
Aren't you gonna pick up
the grape?

842
00:31:30,958 --> 00:31:32,791
It's just... Well, no, no.

843
00:31:32,875 --> 00:31:35,041
Yeah, but I wouldn't drop
a grape on your porch

844
00:31:35,125 --> 00:31:37,249
- and then walk off.
- It's just a grape.

845
00:31:37,333 --> 00:31:38,457
It doesn't matter.

846
00:31:38,541 --> 00:31:42,041
Fucking Hollywood leftist
bullshit is what you are.

847
00:31:42,125 --> 00:31:44,249
Hollywood left... Larry. Come on.

848
00:31:44,333 --> 00:31:47,749
- Eh... Should pick up the grape.
- That's not cool.

849
00:31:47,833 --> 00:31:51,082
It looks like it is a sense
of entitlement there.

850
00:31:51,166 --> 00:31:52,416
It's gonna biodegrade, Larry.

851
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,375
Pick up the fucking grape,
Woody!

852
00:31:55,416 --> 00:31:57,291
Sure, I'll pick up the grape,
Joe.

853
00:31:57,375 --> 00:31:58,416
Here, here's your grape.

854
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,999
Fuck you
with your fucking grape!

855
00:32:01,083 --> 00:32:03,791
And there's a whole
fucking fistful of grapes.

856
00:32:03,875 --> 00:32:06,249
And guess what?
Here's a fucking apple.

857
00:32:06,333 --> 00:32:08,332
- Don't you fucking do it.
- Fuck you.

858
00:32:08,416 --> 00:32:10,874
Fuck this shitty farm.
And guess what?

859
00:32:10,958 --> 00:32:13,999
Your show, good luck with it,
because I ain't doing it.

860
00:32:14,083 --> 00:32:17,000
You know what? Fuck this.
Stay right there, boy.

861
00:32:19,208 --> 00:32:22,083
- Where's he going?
- I think he's getting a gun.

862
00:32:23,458 --> 00:32:25,374
Teddy was right
about you, Larry.

863
00:32:25,458 --> 00:32:28,499
Ted Danson? What did he say?

864
00:32:28,583 --> 00:32:30,499
You should've picked up
the grape!

865
00:32:30,583 --> 00:32:32,499
I'm not seeing well
out of the lenses, you know.

866
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:33,874
I just made bad decisions.

867
00:32:33,958 --> 00:32:35,624
I took two,
I should've taken one.

868
00:32:35,708 --> 00:32:37,374
And I took three
and I should've taken four.

869
00:32:37,458 --> 00:32:39,749
My whole life,
always wrong decisions.

870
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:42,249
- I'm plagued with them.
- Sir, we'll get you a new prescription.

871
00:32:42,333 --> 00:32:44,624
I just need to dilate
your pupils.

872
00:32:44,708 --> 00:32:46,957
This might feel a little cold.
Okay.

873
00:32:47,041 --> 00:32:49,332
Your eyes are gonna be
a little sensitive to light

874
00:32:49,416 --> 00:32:52,374
for the next 30 minutes,
so stay out of direct sunlight.

875
00:32:52,458 --> 00:32:53,541
I'll take it from here.

876
00:32:53,625 --> 00:32:55,457
- I'm definitely prepared for it.
- Thank you so much.

877
00:32:55,541 --> 00:32:56,999
- I'm gonna do one.
- Thank you.

878
00:32:57,083 --> 00:32:58,999
I'm gonna do one,
and I'm gonna do...

879
00:32:59,083 --> 00:33:00,207
What the fuck, Larry?

880
00:33:00,291 --> 00:33:02,541
Why would you go and tell Freddy
I dropped a stupid

881
00:33:02,625 --> 00:33:05,041
fucking Pirate's Booty
on the floor? Are you nuts?

882
00:33:05,125 --> 00:33:06,082
Why didn't you pick it up?

883
00:33:06,166 --> 00:33:07,624
Why do you fucking care
if I picked it up?

884
00:33:07,708 --> 00:33:09,957
It's not that I care. There's
a sense of entitlement there

885
00:33:10,041 --> 00:33:11,416
- that I thought was wrong...
- What?

886
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,291
...and I needed to let my friend
know about that.

887
00:33:13,375 --> 00:33:14,999
Larry, I was gonna pick it up,
okay?

888
00:33:15,083 --> 00:33:16,332
Oh, you were going
to pick it up?

889
00:33:16,416 --> 00:33:17,374
I was going to pick it up.

890
00:33:17,458 --> 00:33:18,582
I don't think you were going
to pick it up.

891
00:33:18,666 --> 00:33:19,749
How do you know
and why do you care?

892
00:33:19,833 --> 00:33:21,124
You know why?
Because I picked it up.

893
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:22,832
No one asked you
to clean it up, Larry.

894
00:33:22,916 --> 00:33:24,082
You know what you could've done?

895
00:33:24,166 --> 00:33:25,707
Hey, I have an idea.
You could've done nothing.

896
00:33:25,791 --> 00:33:27,582
You think I can leave
a Pirate's Booty on the floor?

897
00:33:27,666 --> 00:33:29,041
- No.
- No one fucking cares

898
00:33:29,125 --> 00:33:30,207
about the Pirate's Booty, Larry.

899
00:33:30,291 --> 00:33:31,499
I care about the Pirate's Booty.

900
00:33:31,583 --> 00:33:34,207
You know what, Larry?
It's time for your eye exam.

901
00:33:34,291 --> 00:33:35,582
Huh?

902
00:33:35,666 --> 00:33:38,541
Oh!

903
00:33:38,625 --> 00:33:40,791
Was that a one or a two?

904
00:33:46,791 --> 00:33:53,041
♪

905
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,541
Oh!

906
00:34:06,708 --> 00:34:08,791
What the fuck?

907
00:34:08,875 --> 00:34:13,457
I'm so, so sorry. Are you okay?

908
00:34:13,541 --> 00:34:15,457
I... Yes, I'm fine. Are you okay?

909
00:34:15,541 --> 00:34:16,791
I'm fine, yes. I'm telling you...

910
00:34:16,875 --> 00:34:18,332
Great, my car
is not doing great.

911
00:34:18,416 --> 00:34:19,749
Uh, look,
I'll pay for the whole thing.

912
00:34:19,833 --> 00:34:21,957
I have insurance.
I was at the eye doctor that...

913
00:34:22,041 --> 00:34:23,624
She shoved the thing in my face.

914
00:34:23,708 --> 00:34:24,999
You're not supposed to drive
after that.

915
00:34:25,083 --> 00:34:26,499
Oh, but she shoved it.
She shoved it.

916
00:34:26,583 --> 00:34:28,207
You're supposed to
have someone pick you up.

917
00:34:28,291 --> 00:34:29,166
It doesn't matter.

918
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:30,416
Oh, you're being
very nice about this.

919
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,582
- Can we do the exchange so...
- Uh, yeah, yes.

920
00:34:32,666 --> 00:34:34,708
- Yeah, I'm so sorry.
- Thanks.

921
00:34:36,208 --> 00:34:37,416
Larry.

922
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,166
Mary. I'm Mary.

923
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:43,916
You can take a picture of it
with your phone,

924
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,291
so you can maybe read it later.

925
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:53,666
- Mary Ferguson?
- Yes.

926
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:56,082
- Seriously?
- Yes. What's happening?

927
00:34:56,166 --> 00:34:58,916
Oh, my God.
Your name's Mary Ferguson?

928
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,999
- Yes, it is.
- This is incredible.

929
00:35:01,083 --> 00:35:02,624
- Is it?
- This is<i> kismet.</i>

930
00:35:02,708 --> 00:35:03,832
This is unbelievable.

931
00:35:03,916 --> 00:35:06,916
Would you ever be interested
in a free trip to Asia?

932
00:35:09,458 --> 00:35:10,707
Larry.

933
00:35:10,791 --> 00:35:12,457
You won't believe this,
but I have been having

934
00:35:12,541 --> 00:35:14,207
a recurring dream
about going to Asia.

935
00:35:14,291 --> 00:35:15,374
- Get out of here.
- Right.

936
00:35:15,458 --> 00:35:17,124
And the dates work out perfectly
for my schedule.

937
00:35:17,208 --> 00:35:19,749
So I'm getting excited.
So tell me about this guy.

938
00:35:19,833 --> 00:35:20,957
- Leon?
- Yeah.

939
00:35:21,041 --> 00:35:24,041
Well, let's just say
he's a unique individual.

940
00:35:24,125 --> 00:35:25,291
Okay.

941
00:35:25,375 --> 00:35:27,832
You could not have asked for
a better traveling companion.

942
00:35:27,916 --> 00:35:29,249
- I'm excited.
- Take my word.

943
00:35:29,333 --> 00:35:30,624
I can't wait.

944
00:35:30,708 --> 00:35:33,124
You'd be surprised!
You know what I'm saying?

945
00:35:44,958 --> 00:35:46,374
What the fuck was that?

946
00:35:46,458 --> 00:35:49,957
That...
...was a Mary Ferguson.

947
00:35:50,041 --> 00:35:52,124
I brought her back here
to meet you.

948
00:35:52,208 --> 00:35:54,749
- She was perfect!
- Lost another one.

949
00:35:54,833 --> 00:35:55,832
That's three, Larry.

950
00:35:55,916 --> 00:35:57,541
That's fucking
three Mary Fergusons.

951
00:35:57,625 --> 00:35:59,457
Who told you to have
a watermelon orgy?

952
00:35:59,541 --> 00:36:02,208
You told me that shit.
You said it, Larry.

953
00:36:04,541 --> 00:36:06,874
- Can I join you?
- Fuck yeah, come on, man.

954
00:36:06,958 --> 00:36:08,999
Get in on this sweet meat.

955
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:10,999
What happened to your eyes, man?

956
00:36:11,083 --> 00:36:12,207
Like a fucking raccoon.

957
00:36:12,291 --> 00:36:15,457
I had an accident
at the, uh, optometrist.

958
00:36:15,541 --> 00:36:16,582
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

959
00:36:16,666 --> 00:36:18,707
Cheers! Yeah, cheers.

960
00:36:18,791 --> 00:36:21,291
Repeat after me!

961
00:36:21,375 --> 00:36:24,749
<i>You will not replace us!</i>

962
00:36:24,833 --> 00:36:26,291
Shit, shit, shit, I'm late.

963
00:36:27,875 --> 00:36:29,207
Oh, wow

964
00:36:29,291 --> 00:36:30,582
Here we go.

965
00:36:30,666 --> 00:36:32,374
<i> You will not replace us!</i>

966
00:36:32,458 --> 00:36:34,499
Geez. Sorry I'm late, guys.

967
00:36:34,583 --> 00:36:38,875
<i>You will not replace us!
You will not replace us!</i>

968
00:36:40,458 --> 00:36:42,832
- Look at this guy!
- He's a Jew!

969
00:36:42,916 --> 00:36:44,416
Huh?

970
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:49,874
No! Stop! Some lady made it!

971
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:52,416
Stop! Help!

972
00:36:57,541 --> 00:36:59,625
Larry!

973
00:37:03,125 --> 00:37:04,125
Larry!

974
00:37:04,583 --> 00:37:06,082
Jew boy!

975
00:37:06,166 --> 00:37:09,291
Larry!

976
00:37:09,375 --> 00:37:12,750
Open this fucking door
or I'll break it down.

977
00:37:13,416 --> 00:37:14,999
Larry!

978
00:37:15,083 --> 00:37:17,082
You wanna see
what they did to me?

979
00:37:17,166 --> 00:37:19,707
I'll beat your bald ass, boy!

980
00:37:19,791 --> 00:37:23,416
You crossed the line, buddy.
You think you're real funny!

981
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:24,874
Nobody else did.

982
00:37:24,958 --> 00:37:27,041
I got my ass beat in Santa Fe.

983
00:37:27,125 --> 00:37:29,541
I'll show you something funny.
Get down here!

984
00:37:29,625 --> 00:37:31,041
Fucking race traitor.

985
00:37:31,708 --> 00:37:33,416
Hey, Jew boy, come down.

986
00:37:34,458 --> 00:37:35,458
Larry!

987
00:37:36,583 --> 00:37:39,749
I will pound your commie face,
Larry.

988
00:37:39,833 --> 00:37:41,957
I know that you're home.

989
00:37:42,041 --> 00:37:44,916
Come down here.

990
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,041
Larry, get down here!

991
00:37:48,041 --> 00:37:50,332
What the fuck are you doing,
man?

992
00:37:50,416 --> 00:37:54,041
Shut the fuck up, Larry.

993
00:37:59,525 --> 00:38:00,859
Shit.
