1
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:06,400
I didn't kill her. She was alive when
I left the house. I hitched a lift.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,270
Find that man. He can prove it.

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,550
The fact that I'm too late
for Jack is unbearable,

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:14,670
but I can clear his name.

5
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,510
You're not fantasising or seeing things?

6
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,390
They're all in on it,
every bloody one of them.

7
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,870
I could have killed her
that night for what she did.

8
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,310
- What are you going to say?
- Might spill my guts, tell it all.

9
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:31,310
The only thing you have to do tomorrow is to
come to church and put a ring on this finger.

10
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:35,670
You were riding Leo like a seaside
donkey while Rachel was still alive.

11
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:36,750
Morning, Mr Argyll.

12
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,350
FILTH!

13
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:43,030
You built a nuclear bunker in the
cellar in case the bombs start
falling, so I know you're a mess.

14
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,630
You won't break me, Jack.

15
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:47,030
She's a thirsty old horse, isn't she?

16
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,310
Nasty boy.

17
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,030
He's very keen on neglected children.

18
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,710
A bit too old for you, though, aren't I?

19
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:56,470
One word against me, and I shall
have his head kicked in half.

20
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,400
Bellamy -- he arrested Jack.

21
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,120
He said Jack had done it.

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,074

23
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,960
Jack shouldn't be dead.

24
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:53,360
He shouldn't have been charged
-- shouldn't have been inside.

25
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,360
Why is he dead?

26
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,400
Jack! Hester!

27
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,080
Where are you going?

28
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,400
Has Philip rung for me?

29
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,720
Er... I didn't hear him.

30
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,000
You look terrible.

31
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,480
So do you.

32
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,990
All of you.

33
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,750
You've been fighting.

34
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,640
And talking. We've been talking.

35
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,360
No more secrets.

36
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,390
Here he is! Ah!

37
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,150
Ah, you've grown.

38
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,070
Look at you! Went away
a boy, came back a man.

39
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,790
- Ah! How many Chinese
communists did you kill? - Stop!

40
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,190
What have you been up to? You're
looking way too pleased with yourself.

41
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,670
Ask Mrs Gould. Mother is furious,

42
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,430
but of course, she's smiling though it.

43
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,310
Yeah, well, you want to watch yourself.
One of these days she'll snap,

44
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,990
lock you in a nuclear bunker
and throw away the key.

45
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,750
Come on, soldier boy. We've got beers.

46
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,750
Guess what -- we're going swimming!

47
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,950
Here we go.

48
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,110
Hey, hey, hey!

49
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,760
Nothing changes, Mickey.

50
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,000
Absolutely nothing at all.

51
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,350
You want to live in a bedsit.

52
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,800
I have found one I like.

53
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,640
And I can afford it.

54
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,800
I'm incredibly proud of you, Christina.

55
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,960
You and Michael.

56
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,600
You've both done very well.

57
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:14,950
You know, he seems... more... at ease.

58
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,080
With the world.

59
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,520
Has he met a nice girl?

60
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,990
Not that I know of.

61
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:27,950
And you? Do you have
your eye on a young man?

62
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,680
I'll want to meet him, you know.

63
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,040
I'm so busy at work.

64
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,480
I don't have time for anything like that.

65
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,550
Well --

66
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,070
I'm certain this bedsit will be
hideous, but you know your own mind.

67
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,480
Now, I've got a lot to do, so run along.

68
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,070
Oh, mother.

69
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,430
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm,
mmm! None of that silliness.

70
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,400
I've trained you better than that.

71
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,350
Breathe.

72
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,070
Remember to breathe.

73
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,040
Did you come to tell us something?

74
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,520
We understand how it
could happen with Mother.

75
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,640
Especially that night.

76
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,560
Anyone can snap, Kirsten.

77
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,220
And Mother pushed people.

78
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,440
She pushed all of us.

79
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:37,820
If you're going to be mediocre,
Hester, at least look pretty.

80
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,080
Slouching is ugly. Sit up.

81
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:58,640
"Dear Mother, I'm sorry I'm never
going to be good enough for you.

82
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,000
"I can't live here any more.

83
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,950
"I will ring every Friday at
three, so that nobody worries.

84
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,720
"I want Kirsten to answer.

85
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,640
"Please don't look for me.

86
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,440
"You won't find me."

87
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,390
- Hester?
- 'I'm well, don't worry.'

88
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,230
Hester, please come home. Please,
we miss you so much, so much.

89
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,150
Do you have to sound so desperate?

90
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,720
You're playing right into her hands.

91
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,950
I never heard her say a kind thing to you.

92
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,430
Not even please or thank you.

93
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,920
Just orders, clicking her fingers.

94
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,640
We don't hate you, Kirsten.

95
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,720
We could never hate you.

96
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,840
You might.

97
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,720
I don't know what I'm
going to say to Mary.

98
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,120
I hope she doesn't want to see him.

99
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,160
I had to see Rachel...

100
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,600
.. and it'll never leave me -- her face.

101
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,280
Like that. You know?

102
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,960
This is supposed to be my wedding day.

103
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:58,190
Mr Argyll? Is all of this
happening because of me?

104
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,870
I only wanted to do what was right,

105
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,870
but I seem to have set something off.

106
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,400
It's not you, Arthur.

107
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,120
All this happened a long time ago.

108
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:13,240
It's only now it seems that
everything's coming home to roost.

109
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,640
Mary!

110
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,640
Smile, Mother, so
everyone knows we're happy.

111
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,760
These are your new sisters and brother.

112
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,630
Darling, I'm here!

113
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,390
Right! Mary, have they wiped their feet?

114
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,830
Argh!

115
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:03,270
Everything hurts him.
Please, just don't jolt him.

116
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,350
ARGH! You fucking morons!

117
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,070
Welcome home, Philip.

118
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,280
Be careful! Please, just be careful.

119
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,270
Last post.

120
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,320

I lose my mind. - [ARGH!]

Oh, Mickey!

125
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,960
Mickey, I'm drunk, and I
need to sleep on your floor.

126
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,600
Mickey!

127
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,640
Where's Hester?

128
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,000
She went to the laundry.

129
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,680
You have got to be the mother.

130
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,920
Here... is a cheque...

131
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,000
.. for £500.

132
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:41,120
You take it on the understanding that
you never contact my daughter again.

133
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,000
Hmm!

134
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,710
Where's Simon?

135
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:30,480
He's gone to get eggs and
bread, so we can have breakfast.

136
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,320
I'm not cross, Hester.

137
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,430
- You're not?
- It's Christmas Eve.

138
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,720
How can I be cross?

139
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,800
Sugar milk. Your favourite.

140
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,640
- I don't feel very well.
- Hold on tight.

141
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,150
One step at a time.

142
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,880
Good girl. Good girl.

143
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,520
Come on.

144
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,910
Steady. Come on.

145
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,150
Keep going, there's a good girl.

146
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,320
Nearly there.

147
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,630
She's been involved in
an unfortunate liaison.

148
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,950
I want her examined.

149
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,510
I want to know if she's
carrying the expected result

150
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,830
of such a liaison.

151
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,400
And if she is?

152
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,560
Well?

153
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,510
About three months. May I...?

154
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,830
Have the porters bring her to my car,

155
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,980
and burn the clothes that she was wearing.

00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,590
Only you and I can nurse her.

166
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:37,190
- Why? - Get her in.
Put her straight to bed.

167
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,520
Go.

168
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,800
Christina, it's Mother.

169
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,480
Come to the house. Find
Michael and bring him, too.

170
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,160
You tracked her down, then.

171
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,280
I hope she told you to piss off.

172
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
- Mother!
- Where the hell are you?

173
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,120
Leo?

174
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,240
Oh, shit!

175
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,710
Oh, Christ.

176
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,390
No, Leo. Just your wife.

177
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,310
I'll talk to you in your study,

178
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,360
but first, I want a word
with you, Miss Vaughan.

179
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,120
Naughty Daddy!

180
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,360
Yours, I believe.

181
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,750
You're nothing special, Gwenda.

182
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,270
He's done this before.

183
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:29,750
My husband has a predilection
for screwing the staff.

184
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,510
The plainer the better.

185
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:34,430
I suppose he thinks it'll
make them more grateful.

186
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,990
I'm not the grateful one.

187
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,390
Sometimes, he cries.

188
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,840
Argh!

189
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,790
You ordinary bitch.

190
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,340
Put your cheap knickers on
and get out of my house.

191
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:58,180
You know, I never really enjoy Christmas, but
this one's shaping up to be a real belter.

192
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,640
Hester?

193
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,590
Leave me alone, Jack.

194
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,200
She's... has a fever. It's flu.

195
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:30,040
Don't worry. All right. There
we go. Good girl. I've got you.

196
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,750
I've got you.

197
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,320
I'm divorcing you, Leo.

198
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,760
You won't do that.

199
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,630
You couldn't bear the shame.

200
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,190
Oh, I'll cope.

201
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,830
But you, with your easy life

202
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:53,800
and your bloody book that
no-one wants or cares about...

203
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,630
You'll be penniless.

204
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:01,390
You'll have to work for a living.

205
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,800
How will you cope?

206
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:10,230
Mother? Philip can't live upstairs.

207
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:14,030
- We need to arrange the house, so he has his
own rooms. - Stop pulling. I can't bear it.

208
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,950
Always pulling at me! It's intolerable!

209
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,200
Why did you get me?

210
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:28,640
Why did you get me, if you
weren't going to love me?

211
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,280
I was sad, Mary.

212
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:36,720
I thought you could
make up for that sadness.

213
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,160
It's not your fault you couldn't.

214
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,320
God almighty, Mother.

215
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,920
- Is she settled?
- I'm getting her a hot water bottle.

216
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,950
You're leaving, Jack.

217
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Michael and Christina
are coming to get you.

218
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,080
Have a drink, Mother.

219
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,470
Ah!

220
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,470
- You're going to need one.
- I don't want a drink.

221
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:46,390
They've always been close,
haven't they? Tina and Mickey?

222
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,600
Mickey and Tina.

223
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,560
So close.

224
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,240
I suppose it was inevitable.

225
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,160
They're at each other.

226
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,800
Lovers. I...

227
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,480
I saw them.

228
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,950
His hands all over her.

229
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,550
Her legs wrapped round his back.

230
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,120
"Ah, ah!"

231
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,080
I'm not going anywhere.

232
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,440
There's no getting rid of me.

233
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,840
Aw. Poor Mother.

234
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,600
You should have left me at the orphanage.

235
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,560
I didn't get you from an orphanage.

236
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,440
The woman who gave birth
to you is in the kitchen.

237
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,480
You've known her all your life.

238
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,950
Little boy.

239
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,880
With your temper tantrums.

240
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:00,720
You've no idea what it
takes to keep going.

241
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,880
I'm going to adopt the baby, Kirsten.

242
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,760
My child, but you won't be separated.

243
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:27,510
No-one will ever know.

244
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:30,710
I thought you were going to send me away.

245
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,600
None of this is your fault, Kirsten.

246
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,760
None of it.

247
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,680
Did you want something to eat?

248
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,680
I'm just going to sit here for a bit.

249
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:37,230
Park on the road. Christina,
meet me in the garden room.

250
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:42,710
- And Michael, you stay in the car. - I'll
walk with you. - Do as I say. It's important.

251
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,120
It's Jack, isn't it?

252
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,640
Of course it's Jack.

253
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,800
I wish he'd stop baiting her.

254
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,870
I'm done with this. I'm
done with all of it.

255
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:56,950
I'm done with her. Her mad
rules, her mad bloody bunker.

256
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,950
Everything. I'm done.

257
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,040
Mickey, don't. She loves us really.

258
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,160
Say please.

259
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,630
For once in your life.

260
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,880
Say it!

261
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,520
Please.

262
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,840
There we go.

263
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,950
Wasn't that hard, was it?

264
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,950
Keep that up -- we might get on better.

265
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,270
When you were in Korea,

266
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:26,440
I prayed day and night that
you would come home safely.

267
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,560
So did I.

268
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:38,640
Who'd have thought we'd
have something in common?

269
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:42,720
See, Mother -- we're
getting on better already.

270
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,670
Wouldn't he marry you?

271
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:56,000
What? Who?

272
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:59,260
When you told him you
were having a baby...

273
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,440
.. wouldn't he marry you?

274
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,150
It... wasn't like that.

275
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,840
Is it because of him
that I am the way I am?

276
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,640
Not knowing when to stop.

277
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,960
Am I like him?

278
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,520
I don't... I can't...

279
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,680
You have to take that to Hester.

280
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,080
- Are you coming back?
- Of course I am.

281
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,720
How did you bear it?

282
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,920
I just...

283
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,800
.. did.

284
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,910
Jesus!

285
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,990
What is it?

286
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,350
You found Michael quickly.

287
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,910
He was already with me.

288
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,790
Wrapping presents.

289
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,000
How fortuitous.

290
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:15,200
Jack tells me that you and Michael are...

291
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,440
.. involved.

292
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,640
With each other.

293
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,480
Tell me it isn't true.

294
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,720
I can't.

295
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,360
God.

296
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,720
The love...

297
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:52,080
.. the love I've wasted on you, you whore!

298
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,670
You're disgusting, you repulse me.

299
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,550
So ugly, so stupid.

300
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,150
You are an abomination. You disgust me.

301
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:08,400
You are filth, filth,
filth, filth, filth, FILTH!

302
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:15,190
Where's Jack? What has he done?

303
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:17,680
Jack saw us. He told her.

304
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:22,750
Well, she was going to have to find out
sooner or later, wasn't she, eh? Everyone was.

305
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,470
- We're disgusting. We're filth.
- No. No.

306
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,910
- No. We're not.
- We're stupid and ugly and dirty.

307
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:30,190
Listen to me. Listen to me.

308
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:32,990
We're not any of those things.

309
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,640
Don't run. Don't run.

310
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,840
Let me go! Let me go!

311
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:45,960
Don't!

312
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:09,440
Do you have the time? I'm
supposed to be there by nine.

313
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:56,720
I believed it was true. We all did.

314
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,040
That Jack had done it.

315
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,960
Because of things that
had happened. Things...

316
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,160
Things that had been said.

317
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,120
And his fingerprints.

318
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,830
They were on what was used
to kill her. On the decanter.

319
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,710
Then the weapon must
have been something else.

320
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,080
It has to have been.

321
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,880
Something... similar.

322
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,840
How is Mrs Durrant taking the news?

323
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:51,060
I put the coins on his eyes to close them,
so he looked more peaceful when she saw him.

324
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:55,280
I'll take them off
before she does, though.

325
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,840
There was a needle in his arm.

326
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,040
Poor man.

327
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:06,070
He can't have realised
how dangerous it was.

328
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,600
Whisky and morphine.

329
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,560
I'm so sorry.

330
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,280
I have to tell to Mary.

331
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:28,400
I didn't leave Philip's
shot out for him last night.

332
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,880
He was too drunk.

333
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:36,070
How could he overdose if I
didn't leave him his shot?

334
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,960
It doesn't make any sense.

335
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:43,200
He can't reach the morphine on his own.

336
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,520
Well?

337
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,320
You said he'd never know.

338
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,280
That no-one would know.

339
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,560
You promised.

340
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,360
I'm sorry.

341
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,400
I... I... I was angry.

342
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,870
I hope he doesn't hate you.

343
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,800
I don't want him to hate you.

344
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:44,470
None of this your fault,
none of it. None of it.

345
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,960
- Ah!
- Oh, God.

346
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,710
Oh, God.

347
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,990
I'm so sorry.

348
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,870
So sorry.

349
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,110
Ah! I...

350
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:01,030
I don't know what's happening to me!

351
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,670
I'm... I'm going to get help.

352
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:06,470
No, no, no, no, no! Don't leave
me! Please don't leave me!

353
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:07,950
All right.

354
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,480
Don't go. Please don't leave me.

355
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:17,550
- It's OK. - I'm so
frightened. - Sh, sh, sh.

356
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,720
Please don't leave me.

357
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,880
Little Kirsten.

358
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,520
Rachel?

359
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,680
Rachel?

360
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:10,870
There, there.

361
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,430
There, there.

362
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,240
There, there.

363
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:01,630
You say you went home at the usual time.

364
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:02,830
You didn't see Rachel.

365
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:06,040
I'll come and get you
when the police have gone.

366
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,110
What were you doing up there?

367
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,030
Making sure there's no-one else upstairs.

368
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:17,870
Go to your rooms. Do not go downstairs.

369
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,120
Do as you're told!

370
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:35,280
Jack...

371
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,120
.. was here.

372
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:53,150
Your fingerprints mixed
with your mother's blood.

373
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,160
No-one else's. Yours, Jack.

374
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:04,470
All right.

375
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:06,800
Yeah, let's go to trial.

376
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:10,830
I've always liked an audience,
and now I'm going to get one.

377
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:13,550
A packed-out courtroom
to see the bastard boy

378
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:15,630
go down for murdering his mother.

379
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:22,750
What everyone will want to know
is, what made him the way he is?

380
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:27,830
Yeah, "He'd been given everything.
Why did he turn out so vicious?"

381
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:30,230
It's something in you.
It's your temperament.

382
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:32,160
Something I've inherited.

383
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,320
- Maybe. Who can say?
- Kirsten can.

384
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:39,560
Who made me the way I am?

385
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,720
Well, you did.

386
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:46,950
Daddy.

387
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,760
I've worked it all out.

388
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:52,200
- You're mistaken.
- She was 15.

389
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:56,830
Little girl straight out of some home,

390
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:59,510
little girl with nothing,
come to help with Mary.

391
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:01,030
You know she told us once

392
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:04,070
it was the first time she'd
had a room of her own.

393
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:06,670
And who walks into it? You.

394
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,720
With your cock in your hand.

395
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:12,270
The murderer's father.

396
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:13,750
Your blood in my veins.

397
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:16,710
Oh, I'll take a life sentence for this.

398
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:20,230
If I get the rope, I'll walk up that
scaffold with a song in my heart.

399
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:21,480
It'll be worth it.

400
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:26,840
I'm going to ruin you.

401
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:31,360
I will sow your fields with salt.

402
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:36,270
I will drink from your hollowed skull.

403
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:39,000
I know exactly what you are, Leo Argyll.

404
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:43,240
By the time I'm done,
so will everyone else.

405
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,440
I am your plague.

406
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,680
And I'm coming for you.

407
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:43,470
Open the window. Unlock it.

408
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:45,990
- Open it now.
- Unlock the window. Come out.

409
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:48,550
- Why?
- Arthur! You're in danger!

410
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:50,390
We need to get you out.

411
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:54,470
Through the garden, not out the
front. We can't trust our father.

412
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:57,470
- Open the window, Arthur.
- I'll get my case.

413
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:59,400
Forget the case! Arthur!

414
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,350
Oh.

415
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:05,310
I'm... I'm leaving now.

416
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:07,840
Well, let me see you to the door.

417
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:11,960
No.

418
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:14,510
No!

419
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:18,110
No, no, no, no, no, no!

420
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:19,470
No, no, no!

421
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:21,320
No, no!

422
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:27,600
No, leave me alone! No!

423
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:30,680
No! Leave me alone!

424
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:34,590
Get off me! Leave me alone!

425
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:35,800
No!

426
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:49,190
Very professional men. They
know what they're doing.

427
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:52,000
I'll come and speak with you on the drive.

428
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:04,550
Calgary did abscond. He
very likely did meet Jack,

429
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:07,350
but much later than he said.

430
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:11,110
Jack gave him a time
that would exonerate him.

431
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:16,590
That fragile young man has
been a stooge, not an alibi.

432
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,910
I'm sorry you had to
listen to all of that.

433
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:21,840
It's very... upsetting.

434
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:25,190
So Jack's still guilty.

435
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:26,670
He still did it.

436
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:29,110
I'm afraid so.

437
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:31,640
No-one wanted him to be
innocent more than me.

438
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:38,630
Mary, I need to speak with you,

439
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:41,590
and you're going to
have to be a brave girl.

440
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:45,080
You're going to tell me that
Philip overdosed in the bathroom.

441
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:48,800
Yes.

442
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:53,830
Why is he dead?

443
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:56,230
Well, I'm afraid barbiturates

444
00:50:56,280 --> 00:51:00,750
and whiskey are not a happy combination.

445
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:01,960
Not Philip.

446
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:04,480
Jack.

447
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:09,440
Why is Jack dead?

448
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:12,920
I told them.

449
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:18,120
How he was mine.

450
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:22,880
And yours.

451
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:29,640
Why is he dead?

452
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:35,350
He started a fight with another
prisoner. You know this.

453
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:38,030
But they never found out who killed him.

454
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:40,110
- No.
- Did they try?

455
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:44,030
Of course. Good God, what is this?

456
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:47,430
How did he start the fight?
Someone must have seen.

457
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:50,070
Maybe he said the wrong
thing to the wrong person.

458
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:52,070
Did he say the wrong thing to you?

459
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:54,150
- Did Philip?
- Did mother?

460
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:56,550
What the hell are you accusing me of?

461
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:58,470
Have you lost your damn minds?

462
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:03,510
I keep thinking about what Chief
Constable Gould said to you that time.

463
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:04,910
What time?

464
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:08,920
That time he said he'd have
every bone in Jack's body broken.

465
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:13,960
That he'd have his head kicked in half.

466
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:17,960
And you didn't say that he shouldn't.

467
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:24,030
And I keep thinking how
you went to see Jack,

468
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:25,960
and the next day he was dead.

469
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:29,800
My baby!

470
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,080
Oh, Kirsten.

471
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:39,760
How bitter you are.

472
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:44,590
This is her revenge because
I'm marrying again,

473
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:46,310
and I haven't chosen her.

474
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:49,750
I have to speak with Doctor Morsuch,

475
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:54,520
and then I expect all of you to apologise.

476
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:02,030
But you -- there's nothing you can say.

477
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:04,880
Trying to turn my own children against me?

478
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:08,880
Your life in this house is over.

479
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:38,720
Why?

480
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,400
He was so happy.

481
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:44,400
We were so happy.

482
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:48,600
He admitted it, Gwenda.

483
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:50,960
Admitted what?

484
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:54,280
Mother.

485
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:06,790
Kirsten. Kirsten, please.

486
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:08,190
PLEASE!

487
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:13,550
There, there. There, there.

488
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:16,790
Kirsten.

489
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:19,120
Kirsten, come back.

490
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:26,360
