1
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,190
It was your fingerprints mixed
with your mother's blood.

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:10,910
I didn't kill her. She was
alive when I left the house.

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,190
I am the man in the car.

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,750
Jack Argyll's alibi.

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,590
Arthur, I'd like to buy you dinner.

6
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:19,910
You're too late, Jack died before
the case could come to trial.

7
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,070
- Jack was adopted.
- God, yes. They all are.

8
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:26,390
- I would like to say thank you for
agreeing to be my wife. - No...

9
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,630
I'm not able to discuss my work.

10
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,030
Official secrets.

11
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,630
The whole bloody family are suspects.

12
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:35,230
No-one hated her more than you.

13
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,150
- Filth! - Jack's brother
came to see me. - I need to go.

14
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,070
If Leo Argyll wants you gone,
he'll have to pay big, 50-50 split.

15
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,230
That's extortion.

16
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,030
Which one of them has got
blood on their hands?

17
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,310
- Rachel.
- To Rachel.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,074
-== [ www.OpenSubtitles.com ] ==-

19
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,750
He didn't do it. He's innocent.

20
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:05,280
No, no! I'm damned, I'm damned.

21
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,270
- You can't be here, you really can't.
- I need to speak to your father.

22
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:54,030
- I'll wait until he's awake.
- If this is fun for you, it's not for us.

23
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,470
We've been through hell, you
don't know what that's like.

24
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,720
I know what hell is like.

25
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,840
For Christ's sake...

26
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,700
- I need to make your father listen to me!
- Shut up and get in the car.

27
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,560
Why won't you let me help?

28
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,200
Back in the house.

29
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,840
So, did any of the men
try to flirt with you?

30
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,360
Of course not.

31
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,640
They must be blind.

32
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,230
Your father enjoyed himself.

33
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:25,150
Despite that odd little
chap turning up yesterday.

34
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,110
He seemed to.

35
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,720
That's what matters, isn't it?

36
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:34,630
You know, I'm going to do all I can
to make your father's wedding day

37
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,440
- memorable.
- You're in a good mood.

38
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,840
I am, aren't I?

39
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,470
Excuse me. I know I am too late for
your brother, but I can still help.

40
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,630
I can clear his name.

41
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,980
Leave my family alone.
Leave my brother alone.

42
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,600
Next one.

43
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,630
- It's as if you want him to be guilty.
- Don't tell me what I want.

44
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,510
- That hurt. - It's meant to.
- Why don't you believe me?

45
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,350
I'm telling the truth, Jack was innocent.

46
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,110
Why come straight to
us and not the police?

47
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,110
- I came to... - Shut up. It's
because you're not telling the truth.

48
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:14,310
Not one bit of it - who you
are, where you've been - is true.

49
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,550
- You're fake.
- I...

50
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,160
I don't enjoy doing this.

51
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,150
OK? It's not fun for me.

52
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,440
But I will keep doing it.

53
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,320
Be told.

54
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,800
That man came back, Doctor Calgary.

55
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,780
He was outside the house waiting.

56
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,000
Mickey said not to tell anyone.

57
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,520
Then why are you telling me?

58
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,600
Daddy, I suppose.

59
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,630
Why do you think he came back?

60
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,880
That's what vultures do.

61
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,920
They keep coming back.

62
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,750
To peck at the bones until
there's nothing left.

63
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,030
I think such terrible
things sometimes, Tina.

64
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,550
What I'd like to do to people.

65
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,550
Smash their faces in, so
they're just blood and teeth.

66
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:17,150
- Anyone can snap, can't they? Really do this...
- Stop. You have to stop.

67
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,990
I could've killed her that
night for what she did.

68
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:24,990
♪ I'm dreaming of a white... ♪

69
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,200
I want Daddy.

70
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,840
♪ .. Christmas

71
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,230
♪ Just like the ones I... ♪

72
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,190
I wanted to kill her, I wanted her dead.

73
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,540
You have to stop this.
You have to, because I...

74
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,160
I just can't.

75
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,440
Hester, run along to get dressed.

76
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,870
It's done. He left early.

77
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,220
That's a relief. Thank you.

78
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:22,430
Yes, that Calgary chap said
that you'd pay him a visit.

79
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,550
- Told him to leave.
- You didn't tell me that.

80
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,070
You actually spoke to them?

81
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,350
Well, it isn't as if I can
walk away, darling, is it?

82
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,510
But he did rather sound as if
you'd threatened him, Michael.

83
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,710
- Well, I didn't.
- Well, I just hope nobody overheard him.

84
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,110
He's an excitable fella.

85
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:39,110
He's so desperate to be believed
and tell his story, as it were.

86
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,110
Do you know, the waiters
had to pull him off me.

87
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,710
- What?
- He sounds rather volatile,

88
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,310
and I think it's a very good thing
that Mickey did go and see him.

89
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,470
You wouldn't want anything
disturbing the wedding.

90
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:52,070
- No, we wouldn't.
- Muddying the waters, raking up the dirt.

91
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:56,030
- You really are a first-rate son.
- He is.

92
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,310
Now, let's have breakfast.

93
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,910
I just can't help thinking,
that at the very least,

94
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,590
you should tell the police
about this chap, Leo.

95
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,430
I think they'll be very interested.

96
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,630
Appearing after all this time.

97
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,710
Not to mention, the papers.

98
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:15,350
I mean, we all want to be beyond reproach,
don't we, in this tragic, tragic matter?

99
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:20,600
And warning Doctor Calgary off does
not appear to be beyond reproach.

100
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,720
Quite the opposite.

101
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,510
Don't you think?

102
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,030
Do you know what I think?

103
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,750
I think it's a fucking shame that
you got out of that car crash alive.

104
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,870
Don't you say that to him, don't you dare.

105
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,960
Something on your mind, Mickey? Hm?

106
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:39,800
Where were you on the
night of Rachel's murder?

107
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,590
- At work.
- Who works Christmas eve night?

108
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,510
You and Saint Nick? It's where he lived.

109
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,430
- Of course, he was there.
- Oh, she's piped up.

110
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,110
The faithful retainer.

111
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,750
It's always the servants
that know more than they say.

112
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,320
Philip, be very careful.

113
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,630
How are you getting along with the
old reading and writing now that

114
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,310
there's no-one to help you?

115
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:08,680
All right as long as it's
short words and big letters?

116
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,510
Well, at least I can get it up.

117
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,230
No wonder Mary's gone out of her head.

118
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,670
Stuck with you sponging off her and not
even a decent shafting for her trouble.

119
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:22,190
- I hate you. - Michael...
- I hate you, I hate you!

120
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,870
I'm trying to eat my grapefruit, actually. Actually,
just trying to eat my grapefruit in peace.

121
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,720
- Eat your bloody grapefruit,
I'm not stopping you. - Enough!

122
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,950
You insufferable little prick.

123
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,270
I used to hurt men like you.

124
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,560
- Thrashed.
- Used to?

125
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,120
Not thrashing anything any more, are you?

126
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,550
Can I just say that this subject
matter and this language is not

127
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,510
fit for the breakfast table or
any other table for that matter?

128
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,510
Oh, don't be coy, Gwenda.

129
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:57,110
We all know that you were riding Leo
like a seaside donkey while Rachel

130
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:00,000
was still alive. Probably
on this sodding table.

131
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,440
I know this is about money.

132
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,480
I'm not increasing Mary's allowance.

133
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:21,390
So this cruel game you're
playing needs to stop...

134
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,440
.. now.

135
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,080
Well...

136
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,760
Where were you?

137
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,390
When?

138
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,440
You know when.

139
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,910
As I told the police,

140
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:53,790
I was at home listening to
records and wrapping presents.

141
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,720
- I went to bed early.
- Oh, yes, home.

142
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,990
Home...

143
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,830
That little bedsitter of yours in town.

144
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,070
Why did you give that up?

145
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,120
Why did you...

146
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,710
.. come back? Hm?

147
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,550
I wanted to be close to my family,

148
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,600
obviously.

149
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,000
And what happened to you and Mickey?

150
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,350
You used to be as thick as
thieves, you two and Jack.

151
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,830
The Three Musketeers.

152
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:29,200
Now you barely look at
each other. I wonder why.

153
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,310
Our mother was murdered

154
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:38,120
and Jack died in an act
of unspeakable savagery.

155
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,790
It has an effect.

156
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,920
Hm.

157
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,310
You're like a little cat.

158
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,680
Silent and secretive.

159
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,600
Here pussy, pussy, pussy.

160
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,360
Keep going, I like it. Ah-ha-ha.

161
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,990
Something gnawing away at you, Christina?

162
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,790
Why don't you just unburden your soul.

163
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,840
Confess.

164
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,480
Confess.

165
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,230
Can I get a lift?

166
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,240
Yes.

167
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,030
No...

168
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:12,320
No, let me off. Let me off.

169
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,350
Let me off!

170
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,830
Let me off!

171
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,080
Let me off! Let me off.

172
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,560
No, no...

173
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,840
Hello. Oh, here she is.
Morning, Miss Argyll.

174
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,200
Why are you so rude? You
never say hello back.

175
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,990
Jack saw us.

176
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,400
You're our favourite. We
just want to be friends.

177
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,510
Fuck off!

178
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:24,030
Fuck off! And leave me alone.

179
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,480
Go on, that's it!

180
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,160
Hmph!

181
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,830
What on earth possessed you, Christina?

182
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,630
My daughter screaming profanities
in public and hurling her shoes at

183
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,710
children, completely unprovoked.

184
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,390
They're not children.
It wasn't unprovoked.

185
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,950
It's every day, every day.

186
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,910
You are an Argyll.

187
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:13,190
Before anything. First
and foremost, an Argyll.

188
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:17,190
Your mother taught you to behave
with dignity and restraint.

189
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,870
She taught you standards.

190
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,760
So, remember them.

191
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,280
Telling off, over.

192
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:40,800
I need my best girl to be at her best.

193
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:46,560
I'm quite nervous about this
wedding day tomorrow, you know?

194
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,600
Run wild, make all the noise you want.

195
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,360
- Come on, Mary.
- Come on, Mary.

196
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,920
Wait for us.

197
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,200
Make room for each other, now hold hands.

198
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,390
Really tight. Ready?

199
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,510
One, two, three...

200
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,170
Yell, Mary. Scream!

201
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,270
Sunny Point.

202
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,670
You want me to go to the police?

203
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,990
I beg your pardon, who is this?

204
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,950
It's Calgary. I'm going to the police.

205
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,990
I have telephoned them and told them
I'm coming in to make a statement.

206
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,270
Then you'll believe I'm telling the truth.

207
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,710
Jack was innocent.

208
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,960
And your wife's killer is still free.

209
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:56,280
So what, let him. Let the
police deal with him.

210
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,320
Yes?

211
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,440
I've got some errands
to run before tomorrow.

212
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:08,960
I won't be long.

213
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,920
Chief Constable Gould.

214
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:36,910
- Bellamy. - I'm going to
take charge of this, Leo.

215
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,200
Nothing left to chance.

216
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,120
Perfect match.

217
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,070
Doctor Calgary, the
station rang me at home.

218
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,800
Are you certain about this?

219
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:01,110
I'm certain. Whoever was
investigating, accused the wrong man.

220
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:04,190
Jack Argyll is dead
because of their mistake.

221
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,760
I'll go ahead, set everything up for you.

222
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,500
You could have given me a lift.

223
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:47,110
All right, all right.

224
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,400
No, no.

225
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:53,550
- There's no water.
- I'll get some then. And...

226
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,900
.. I wanted to say that...

227
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,720
.. there is no disappointment.

228
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:05,230
About, well, certain
consequences of your accident.

229
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,710
That side of things isn't important to me.

230
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,920
And I love you very much.

231
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,120
Your breath smells.

232
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,430
It's all those pills you're taking.

233
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,080
They dry you out. You're dried-up.

234
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,320
Why are you so cruel to me?

235
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,910
It's like kicking a whipped dog.

236
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,790
It's easy.

237
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,430
And the dog expects it, which you
are, Mary, you're a whipped dog.

238
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,080
Licking the hand that beats you.

239
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,640
I'll get your water.

240
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,040
You have to be nicer to Mary.

241
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,670
You'll get on better with Daddy.

242
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,990
That's what it's always about, isn't it?

243
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,470
Keeping Daddy happy.

244
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,720
Just please, Philip.

245
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,120
All right.

246
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,560
For you.

247
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,230
Good.

248
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,400
Uh!

249
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:56,160
Well, there have got to be some
perks to being in this bloody family.

250
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,790
You keep coming back, Doctor Calgary.

251
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,240
I have to do the right thing.

252
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,320
And I am telling the truth, but...

253
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,150
.. I have been lying.

254
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,750
On the 24th of December 1954,

255
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:47,190
I was admitted to a psychiatric
institution against my will.

256
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:52,030
I got out. I stole a coat and
I stole a car and I absconded.

257
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,710
I met your brother on the road.

258
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,870
I drove him to the town.

259
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,020
And then I was caught.

260
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,030
Of course, I was caught. I don't
know why I thought I could get away.

261
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,590
I wasn't myself, I was quite distressed.

262
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,910
And that's where I've been,
for a year and a half.

263
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:11,000
Not in a research station, not working.

264
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,780
I've been in an asylum.

265
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,840
I was released yesterday.

266
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,600
What were you wearing when you met Jack?

267
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,640
Hospital-issued pyjamas, they had stripes.

268
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,950
Miss Argyll, I have to speak
to your father urgently.

269
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,360
It's so important.

270
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,390
You all thought he was a con man.

271
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,960
I kept saying it, didn't I?

272
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:56,190
What if Jack was telling the truth?

273
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,840
What if there really was an alibi?

274
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:01,040
Well, here he is.

275
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,320
So, what now?

276
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,270
Well, why would someone
want to run you over?

277
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,550
- I don't know.
- What did he look like?

278
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,670
I don't know. I didn't see
his face, not completely.

279
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,470
I mean, I did, but that
was when he was dead.

280
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:36,960
Doctor Calgary, Arthur,
this all sounds rather

281
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:41,550
- fantastical. - He had a signet
ring, on his little finger.

282
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,520
The crest was in the shape of a crown.

283
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,880
- You know him?
- I think so.

284
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,790
Bellamy Gould, our friend.

285
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,590
Well, I have to tell someone, his wife.

286
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:56,710
- Mr Argyll, think just a moment.
- We can't just leave him lying there.

287
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,510
- That's barbaric. - I told the police
I was coming in to make a statement

288
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,790
and the next thing, your
friend is driving his car at me.

289
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,230
I was being shut up, got rid of.

290
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:07,230
You can't trust the police, they're...
they're covering for someone.

291
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,030
We've lived here for 25 years.

292
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:12,790
You're talking about people who
came to Rachel's funeral and wept.

293
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:16,390
I don't want my family to
know about this, not yet.

294
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,440
Michael is...

295
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,630
He has a short fuse.

296
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:23,580
He'll want to retaliate, I don't
want another child in prison.

297
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,950
Poole will know what to do with all this.

298
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,950
My solicitor, I trust him.

299
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,150
And as for Bellamy...

300
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,800
.. who I thought was my friend...

301
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,110
He arrested Jack.

302
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:38,520
He charged Jack. He said...

303
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,920
.. Jack had done it.

304
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,600
I gave my clothes to a tramp.

305
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,790
A gentleman of the road.

306
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:07,320
Anyway, desperate for a slash.

307
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,600
Hester.

308
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,880
Now, what do you see in your husband?

309
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,350
I mean, really, he's
just a jumped up copper.

310
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:46,150
He's the Chief Constable,
a very important man.

311
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,630
Aren't you so bored you could scream?

312
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,230
He says you should have gone
to Korea with your brother.

313
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:54,310
He says a good war would sort you out.

314
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:58,390
And do you think I need
sorting out, Lydia?

315
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,390
Don't call me Lydia. It's bad manners.

316
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,750
And move. I need to get to the bathroom.

317
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:04,800
Step over me...

318
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,520
.. Mrs Gould.

319
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,160
Nasty boy.

320
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,860
Spelling mistakes. Do them again.

321
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,320
Morning, Mr Argyll.

322
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,720
Where's Jack?

323
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,000
What's this about, Bellamy?

324
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,110
He's been stealing from us.

325
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,670
Not true, I'm afraid.

326
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:00,110
The fragrant Lydia practically
forced the money on me.

327
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,880
Well, why would she give you money?

328
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,140
Because I've been fucking her, Mother.

329
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,590
It was only supposed to be the once...

330
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,920
- Stop it!.. - but she's a thirsty old
horse, isn't she? - You little shit!

331
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,390
- Jack...
- That's more like it, isn't it?

332
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:20,520
Bit too old for you, though, aren't I?

333
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,600
Pervert.

334
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,240
Bellamy, I am so...

335
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:37,150
The Goulds are friends of ours!

336
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,080
- Bellamy has helped me so much
with the trust. - Yes, I'm sure.

337
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,240
He's very keen on orphans
and neglected children.

338
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,900
Always happy to help them.

339
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:52,390
You try so hard to appal me.

340
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,480
You're such a gutless fraud, Mother.

341
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,190
Smiling like there's nothing wrong.

342
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,190
But you built a nuclear bunker in
the cellar in case the bombs start

343
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:04,470
falling, so I know you're
terrified, I know you're a mess.

344
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,430
Just admit it.

345
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,630
Stop smiling. Stop pretending.

346
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,960
And, in return, I'll stop.

347
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,000
You won't break me, Jack.

348
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:27,190
One word against me and I am warning
you, I don't care if we are friends,

349
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:31,110
Leo, I shall have his head kicked in half.

350
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:34,680
Every bone in his body broken.

351
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:57,270
I'm not going to say anything about
your offer to help me blackmail

352
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:00,080
this family. I don't
want to upset your wife.

353
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,600
Do you really not know what you've done?

354
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,910
The bomb you've just dropped?

355
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:10,320
If Jack's innocent,
then one of them isn't.

356
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,990
Dinner's served.

357
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,990
The family are waiting for you.

358
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,270
The old back's playing up.

359
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,320
I think I'm just going to take myself off.

360
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,350
Shall I fetch Mary for you?

361
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,400
I'll be fine.

362
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,000
I realise that my...

363
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,520
.. my history of...

364
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:51,310
.. being unwell makes me
an unreliable witness.

365
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:54,470
But the hospital can back up what I say.

366
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:57,720
The time and manner of my
absconding and the time of my...

367
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,110
.. well, my capture.

368
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,950
And you're quite well now?

369
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,110
Not fantasising or seeing things?

370
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:08,470
- Gwenda. - Well, really, he
said he'd been to the Arctic.

371
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,630
I really was meant to be going there.

372
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,800
I was part of a research team.

373
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:19,360
- But, obviously, I...
- The question is, if Jack didn't kill Mother...

374
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,840
.. then who did?

375
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,920
There was someone else here.

376
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:30,350
- Someone else?
- There was a car parked on the road.

377
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,950
I had to swerve to avoid it.

378
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
What sort of car?

379
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,380
I only saw it for a second.

380
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,120
Small. Brown.

381
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,270
If the owner of that car could be found,

382
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:46,270
you'd have the person that
did this to your family.

383
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,030
Or at the very least
knows something about it.

384
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,510
A brown car?

385
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,470
There's no shortage of them about.

386
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,520
It's a start.

387
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:59,750
The fact that I'm too late
for Jack is unbearable.

388
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,480
But I can clear his name.

389
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:05,430
I can do that much. Just...

390
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:08,080
.. one good, true thing.

391
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,750
Well, my solicitor will be here
first thing in the morning.

392
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,840
And then we can begin
clearing Jack's name.

393
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:22,110
I think you're a very honourable man.

394
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,400
No. I'm not.

395
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,560
I'm really not.

396
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:50,240
What are you so scared of, Arthur?

397
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,590
The end of the world.

398
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:03,470
All those people... blown to nothing.

399
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,960
Boom!

400
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,470
(All those people...)

401
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,780
What have I done? What have I done?

402
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:21,030
I'm dammed.

403
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,200
I'm dammed.

404
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,080
No!

405
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:46,040
No! No!

406
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,470
He only went to bed because
you were rude to him.

407
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:53,320
People like that shouldn't
be allowed to just roam about.

408
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:56,720
Where are you going?

409
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:03,320
A bride never spends the night
before her wedding in with her groom.

410
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,830
And I wasn't even in
the house that evening.

411
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,390
So...

412
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:14,070
.. I don't see why I should be
subjected to an interrogation,

413
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,760
if it's all the same to you, Mary.

414
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,880
Leo.

415
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,550
You told us you got rid of that car

416
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:39,600
because Mother had given it to you
and the memories hurt too much.

417
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:43,880
- They did. - Well, why are you
worried they might be recognised?

418
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:48,470
Because, in the dark and fog,

419
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:52,720
a red car might easily
be mistaken for brown.

420
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,470
Mickey, don't.

421
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:59,110
Say please for once in your life.

422
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,310
Say it!

423
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,960
Daddy is blind to you.

424
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:06,870
And you. Always has been.

425
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,200
But I am not.

426
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,830
I'll see you in the usual place...

427
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,320
.. where we won't be heard.

428
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:45,110
You'd better start thinking
about what you're going to say.

429
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,480
What are you going to say?

430
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,910
Fuck it.

431
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:54,230
- I might just go spill my guts,
tell it all. - You wouldn't.

432
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,880
It'd be better than this.

433
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:11,120
Because this...

434
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,200
.. this ain't living.

435
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,080
No-one can call this a life.

436
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:51,070
Solicitors tomorrow?

437
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,150
- Really?
- I have to.

438
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:55,270
No. The only thing you have to
do tomorrow is put on a suit,

439
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:59,240
come to church, say your vows,
and put a ring on this finger.

440
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,550
- I don't see how I can...
- Find a way, Leo.

441
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:05,510
I don't care what way, just find it is.

442
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:08,000
Church. Tomorrow.

443
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,400
Noon.

444
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,600
And I'll make it all better.

445
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,640
As I always do.

446
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:56,760
(Stop breathing down my neck.)

447
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,240
(Bitch.)

448
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:11,110
I'll get you ready for bed and
then I have something to do.

449
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,160
I'm staying up.

450
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,360
Why?

451
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:17,940
What have you got that for?

452
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:30,400
The only person in this family
who couldn't have killed her...

453
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:36,270
.. was me. Because I was upstairs in bed.

454
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,600
With a broken spine.

455
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,120
Where were you?

456
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,830
Well...

457
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,720
.. this is a new experience, isn't it?

458
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,560
You being afraid.

459
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:56,240
Am I still the whipped dog,
licking the hand that beats me?

460
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:58,870
Hm?

461
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:01,630
I like you nervous, Philip.

462
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:02,680
It suits you.

463
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:23,800
Well, then, spit it out.

464
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:30,150
I wanted to speak to Mother about
changing my job at the library.

465
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:31,990
I parked on the road to think.

466
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:33,830
I got out to get some fresh air.

467
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,670
I didn't see any car go past.

468
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:40,470
I didn't see Mother. I changed
my mind, and went home.

469
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:42,830
If you're going to make something
up, try and make it good.

470
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:45,030
It's what happened. I was with her.

471
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:47,430
Of course you were. Lurking in the dark.

472
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:48,480
Why were you there?

473
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:51,390
Backup. You know what Mother was like.

474
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:53,710
I'd been telling her for
ages she should leave,

475
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:56,190
- she is treated like the tea girl.
- She is the tea girl!

476
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,510
All lah-di-dah and full of herself

477
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,270
but we remember when you arrived,

478
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:03,270
crawling with fleas,
wetting the bed every night.

479
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:05,070
- What's that got to do with it?
- Everything!

480
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:07,430
- Why did you lie?
- Because she's devious!

481
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:09,710
And he... he's a freak.

482
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:12,910
Having to eat your dinner with a
spoon because you can't be trusted

483
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:17,640
with anything sharp. Gouging holes
out of your arms and your legs.

484
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:20,710
- We all know you do it.
- Shut up!

485
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:22,670
You're no better than us, Mary.

486
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:25,710
- You're no different.
- I am different, I am better, I was first,

487
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,190
I was chosen! The rest of you have just...

488
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:32,040
- .. - just turned up. - Tina, why
didn't you just say that you were there?

489
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,360
I didn't want anyone thinking
Mother was difficult to talk to.

490
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:40,590
I...

491
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:42,910
We didn't want anyone
thinking that about her.

492
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:46,230
You sound like you've been
practising that in the mirror.

493
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:48,230
Well...

494
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:50,990
Let's just see who's best girl now.

495
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:54,590
I was so scared that I had done something,

496
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:57,790
and every time I said that to you,
you couldn't tell me that I hadn't?

497
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:02,230
You're no better than them.
What you did, what you are.

498
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:04,670
Throwing yourself at men.

499
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,150
So cheap.

500
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:07,950
Damaged goods.

501
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Shop soiled.

502
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:12,750
It's no wonder Daddy's ashamed of you.

503
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:16,750
It wasn't us! It wasn't, and it
wasn't you, Hester. You were so ill!

504
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,590
We thought you were going to die,
too, how could you have done anything?

505
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:21,430
Ahh!

506
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:24,230
None of you should have been here!

507
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:27,030
It should have just been me!

508
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:29,800
On my own with her, it
should have just been me!

509
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:33,880
You ruined it.

510
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:40,800
You ruined it, you all ruined it!

511
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:46,480
Mary...

512
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:52,400
.. was it you?

513
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,240
Police?

514
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:36,990
Hello? Hello!

515
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,040
Philip.

516
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,440
Put the telephone down.

517
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:46,710
Don't call the police, Philip.

518
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:48,880
We'll talk when you're sober.

519
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:40,030
- Lieutenant Durrant.
- Calgary, get in here.

520
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:41,080
Get in here!

521
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:44,880
Is everything OK?

522
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:46,920
Come here.

523
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:49,640
They're all in on it.

524
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:52,590
All of them.

525
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,310
Every bloody one of them.

526
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:58,270
- How do you mean?
- I tried to call the police and Leo...

527
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:01,630
.. Leo wouldn't let me and then he
came and took the phone away from me.

528
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:04,190
There's a good reason for
not wanting the police.

529
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:07,200
Listen to me! This house
is a bloody death trap.

530
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,590
And you need to get me...

531
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:11,750
.. out of here.

532
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:16,120
They know that I know, and
they'll come for me, and you.

533
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:22,150
Lieutenant Durrant...

534
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:26,230
.. when you wanted to use Mrs Argyll's
murder as a means of extortion,

535
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:28,590
you were drunk, and you're drunk now.

536
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:29,640
Very drunk.

537
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:32,720
I think you need some rest.

538
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:37,720
Oh, Christ.

539
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:41,280
Get away from me!

540
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:46,280
Dis... missed. BUGGER OFF!

541
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:26,880
Oh, God.

542
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:33,520
Of course it's you.

543
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,160
Morning.

544
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:52,150
It wasn't only the police I told.

545
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:53,900
I was coming in to make a statement.

546
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:56,760
I also told you.

547
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:01,080
You're the one who wants to shut me up.

548
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:04,280
It's you.

549
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:20,750
Off you go. Take my car.
Drive to the nearest city.

550
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:23,150
Talk to the police there.
Tell them who you are.

551
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:27,470
No-one here is holding you
prisoner, least of all me.

552
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,270
Door's open, keys are right there.

553
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:30,320
Pick them up and go.

554
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:36,310
Not everyone would have taken a
psychiatric patient into their home,

555
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:42,440
Arthur. I presume they gave you pills
or something to keep you reasonable.

556
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:45,840
Do me the courtesy of taking them.

557
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:50,240
I don't... have them any more.

558
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,040
They make me numb.

559
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:12,520
They... make me...

560
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:18,600
.. not mind. I don't deserve
to not mind what I've done...

561
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:21,800
What could you possibly have done?

562
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:24,880
My work...

563
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:27,360
I didn't know.

564
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:37,270
Didn't know what?

565
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:40,640
You're a physicist, what
was it you were working on?

566
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:45,200
I wrote a formula.

567
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:49,550
Part of a formula...

568
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:53,870
.. for detonation.

569
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:55,440
Fat Man and Little Boy.

570
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:58,360
For the bomb.

571
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:00,480
I'm damned.

572
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:06,720
So... clearing Jack's
name, it's atonement.

573
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:10,800
One...

574
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:13,640
.. good, true thing.

575
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:16,430
Just one.

576
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:17,550
Just one.

577
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:19,520
And you can have it.

578
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:25,790
The door's open, you don't
need to be here to be...

579
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:26,840
.. redeemed.

580
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:53,080
I'm so sorry. I'm...

581
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:56,430
.. sorry. I'm...

582
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:58,520
Come on. Least said...

583
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:00,880
.. soonest mended.

584
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:07,880
- Will you need anything else?
- Not at the moment, thank you.

585
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:37,640
Well?

586
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:40,360
You promised.

587
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:00,910
May I...

588
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:02,480
- .. - ask a question? - Of course.

589
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:06,160
Why are you so convinced it was Jack?

590
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:13,070
He was an extreme young man.

591
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:15,590
The evidence against him seemed...

592
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:19,520
.. conclusive. Everything
against him seemed conclusive.

593
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:25,190
Where is Mrs Durrant?

594
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:27,870
Still asleep. It was a
late night for everyone.

595
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:29,150
I didn't hear them come in.

596
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:33,190
She sometimes spends the night
in her old bedroom upstairs.

597
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:37,160
- Why? - The shower has been
running quite a while, I think.

598
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:39,560
Perhaps he's fallen.

599
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:53,800
Philip!

600
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:58,870
- Is it locked?
- No, in case he needs help.

601
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:00,000
Philip?

602
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:03,160
We're coming in.

603
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:30,710
Is all of this happening because of me?

604
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:32,680
All this happened a long time ago.

605
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:44,760
Tell me it isn't true.

606
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:48,320
How did you bear it?

607
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:59,240
I suppose it was inevitable.
They're at each other.

608
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:03,880
He can't reach the morphine on his own.

609
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,520
No, no!

610
00:58:08,305 --> 00:59:08,651
