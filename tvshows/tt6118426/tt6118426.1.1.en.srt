4
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:54,529
Ah...

5
00:01:42,539 --> 00:01:43,749
Stop, stop!

6
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:46,908
Kirsten, now, now, calm yourself.

7
00:01:46,958 --> 00:01:47,988
There.

8
00:01:48,538 --> 00:01:51,987
There, there, there. Shuh, Shuh!

9
00:01:52,257 --> 00:01:53,637
There, there...

10
00:02:21,431 --> 00:02:24,021
She was alive when I left
the house. I hitched a lift.

11
00:02:24,071 --> 00:02:25,500
It was a good car. It was big.

12
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:27,340
It was practically brand-new.

13
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:28,820
The driver was in his 30s.

14
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:32,459
He was wearing a dark overcoat and
a striped shirt and I saw the cuff.

15
00:02:32,509 --> 00:02:34,378
It was striped, like pyjamas.

16
00:02:34,428 --> 00:02:37,458
- I'm sorry, am I boring you, Father?
- If you had a name...

17
00:02:37,508 --> 00:02:40,547
I didn't ask his name. I
didn't know I'd be needing it.

18
00:02:42,107 --> 00:02:44,336
All your life, you've courted trouble

19
00:02:44,386 --> 00:02:46,466
and never faced any consequences.

20
00:02:48,305 --> 00:02:51,175
But you have to face the
consequences now, Jack.

21
00:02:51,225 --> 00:02:54,024
- You have to.
- I didn't kill her.

22
00:02:55,704 --> 00:02:57,933
Please, find that man, find that man.

23
00:02:57,983 --> 00:02:59,453
He can prove it.

24
00:02:59,503 --> 00:03:01,183
I didn't do it.

25
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:04,022
Perfect match.

26
00:03:05,262 --> 00:03:07,741
'And that's the last twist
of the knife, Jack.'

27
00:03:10,461 --> 00:03:13,140
Your refusal to admit what you have done.

28
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,460
It was you.

29
00:03:18,339 --> 00:03:21,249
Your fingerprints mixed

30
00:03:21,299 --> 00:03:23,208
with your mother's blood.

31
00:03:23,258 --> 00:03:25,448
No-one else's.

32
00:03:25,498 --> 00:03:26,657
Yours, Jack.

33
00:03:38,775 --> 00:03:45,524
I'd hoped that, one day, he might
understand what he had done to us.

34
00:03:45,574 --> 00:03:50,133
I'd hoped your brother
might, one day, be sorry.

35
00:03:54,852 --> 00:03:57,121
He wasn't.

36
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:03,130
But we forgive him because we loved him.

37
00:04:05,409 --> 00:04:06,809
And now...

38
00:04:09,009 --> 00:04:12,758
.. we have to look after each
other and keep on living.

39
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:57,349
Michael? Christina?

40
00:04:57,399 --> 00:05:00,068
These are your new sisters and brother.

41
00:05:00,118 --> 00:05:02,028
Mary, Hester and Jack.

42
00:05:02,078 --> 00:05:04,347
You'll be very happy here.

43
00:05:04,397 --> 00:05:07,476
A good bath, tea and then straight to bed.

44
00:05:29,872 --> 00:05:31,671
Aren't you grubby little tykes?

45
00:05:58,146 --> 00:05:59,656
Everybody ready?

46
00:05:59,706 --> 00:06:01,615
That's quite tight, Jack.

47
00:06:01,665 --> 00:06:02,705
Smile, Mother.

48
00:06:04,105 --> 00:06:05,704
So everyone knows we are happy.

49
00:06:06,944 --> 00:06:08,864
Best faces, please.

50
00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:20,159
Leo!

51
00:07:20,209 --> 00:07:22,318
I'm off now.

52
00:07:22,368 --> 00:07:24,128
Don't lose track of the time.

53
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,766
Bloody... hell.

54
00:08:07,719 --> 00:08:08,989
All the cuttings raked up.

55
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:12,678
- All the cuttings! - Yes,
ma'am. - I'll be checking.

56
00:08:25,155 --> 00:08:26,705
'There are, of course,

57
00:08:26,755 --> 00:08:28,984
some concerns about the high risk of fire

58
00:08:29,034 --> 00:08:31,384
should there be an atomic
detonation in Britain.

59
00:08:31,434 --> 00:08:33,024
But people must remember

60
00:08:33,074 --> 00:08:35,703
that our homes are built very differently

61
00:08:35,753 --> 00:08:38,262
to the domestic architecture in Japan.

62
00:08:38,312 --> 00:08:42,462
There, the houses are made from
light, highly flammable materials,

63
00:08:42,512 --> 00:08:44,901
such as paper and card...

64
00:08:44,951 --> 00:08:47,341
- Kirsten? - .. and any
schoolchild will tell you

65
00:08:47,391 --> 00:08:49,790
that paper and card
burn quickly and easily.

66
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:57,508
Kirsten!

67
00:09:08,426 --> 00:09:11,536
Why doesn't anyone in this house
answer when I call for them?

68
00:09:11,585 --> 00:09:12,625
I didn't hear you.

69
00:09:14,825 --> 00:09:16,774
My dress for this evening
is hanging in my room.

70
00:09:16,824 --> 00:09:18,454
It needs a press.

71
00:09:18,504 --> 00:09:20,854
And will you please cover your legs?

72
00:09:20,904 --> 00:09:22,533
Hosiery.

73
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:24,773
No-one wants to see your chunky calves.

74
00:09:24,823 --> 00:09:26,252
Yes, Miss Vaughan.

75
00:09:26,302 --> 00:09:29,142
And no creases in the tablecloths.

76
00:09:40,499 --> 00:09:42,739
Nearest stop to Sunny Point, please.

77
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:02,165
Hester?

78
00:10:02,215 --> 00:10:03,615
Hester!

79
00:10:06,454 --> 00:10:08,294
I don't know what you're smiling at.

80
00:10:10,493 --> 00:10:12,733
It's my house now.

81
00:10:29,849 --> 00:10:30,819
[Hester?]

82
00:10:31,369 --> 00:10:33,088
[Hester!]

83
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:56,584
[Hester!]

84
00:11:16,479 --> 00:11:18,799
Honestly, Hester, we're going to be late.

85
00:11:25,358 --> 00:11:27,237
Right. In.

86
00:11:36,355 --> 00:11:38,505
I do have to go to work after this.

87
00:11:38,555 --> 00:11:40,344
I think fitting bridesmaids dresses

88
00:11:40,394 --> 00:11:42,744
is a teensy bit more
important than stamping books

89
00:11:42,794 --> 00:11:44,914
in a boring, bloody
library, actually, Tina.

90
00:11:52,432 --> 00:11:54,312
Now look what you've made me do.

91
00:13:09,656 --> 00:13:11,935
You ready for me, darling?]

92
00:14:38,117 --> 00:14:40,147
You need a shave.

93
00:14:40,197 --> 00:14:42,426
Don't they sell razors in London?

94
00:14:42,476 --> 00:14:44,746
- Where's your case?
- I'll get it in a minute.

95
00:14:44,796 --> 00:14:47,465
Well, well, the prodigal returns.

96
00:14:47,515 --> 00:14:51,025
Let's round up the fatted calf,

97
00:14:51,075 --> 00:14:55,354
slit its throat and sport
and play in its hot blood.

98
00:14:56,474 --> 00:14:58,303
- Philip.
- Mickey.

99
00:14:58,353 --> 00:15:00,143
Good, you're here.

100
00:15:00,193 --> 00:15:02,702
Finally. Come.

101
00:15:02,752 --> 00:15:04,152
Sorry, darling.

102
00:15:05,952 --> 00:15:08,711
It's only London, Mickey, you
could have got here sooner.

103
00:15:52,782 --> 00:15:54,211
Mickey, this sham of a wedding

104
00:15:54,261 --> 00:15:56,211
cannot go ahead and I'm relying on you.

105
00:15:56,261 --> 00:15:57,571
I'm the only one that cares

106
00:15:57,621 --> 00:16:00,010
that Daddy's marrying
that bloody secretary.

107
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,650
Tina's like a ghost, Hester's
playing the innocent baby.

108
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,169
It's as if mother never existed.

109
00:16:04,219 --> 00:16:05,849
You're cutting it a bit fine, aren't you?

110
00:16:05,899 --> 00:16:08,249
I mean, they're getting married
the day after tomorrow.

111
00:16:08,299 --> 00:16:11,048
Daddy isn't thinking clearly.
He's just blinded by S-E-X,

112
00:16:11,098 --> 00:16:14,087
which is all Gwenda's got,
but that works in our favour.

113
00:16:14,137 --> 00:16:15,487
I've got a plan.

114
00:16:15,537 --> 00:16:19,806
You pay her a lot of
attention and flatter her,

115
00:16:19,856 --> 00:16:21,926
let her see you looking at her.

116
00:16:21,976 --> 00:16:24,125
At her... curves.

117
00:16:24,175 --> 00:16:25,935
Letting your eyes linger.

118
00:16:26,935 --> 00:16:28,724
You make up to her

119
00:16:28,774 --> 00:16:30,774
and then, well, you know?

120
00:16:32,414 --> 00:16:34,083
- What?
- You make a pass at her.

121
00:16:34,133 --> 00:16:36,683
She responds, which she
will, because she's a tart,

122
00:16:36,733 --> 00:16:39,602
and we arrange it so that Daddy
catches her and she's gone.

123
00:16:39,652 --> 00:16:44,441
He throws her out and he'll be
upset, of course, but he'll have us.

124
00:16:44,491 --> 00:16:47,320
If he catches me up his fiancee,
he won't have me, will he?

125
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:49,240
Yes, but I'll convince him it was all her.

126
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:50,680
And you'll be completely forgiven

127
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:53,239
because he'll realise you
are both just victims

128
00:16:53,289 --> 00:16:54,879
of the same gold-digging slut!

129
00:16:54,929 --> 00:16:57,478
Mary, you need to lie
down in a nice dark room

130
00:16:57,528 --> 00:17:00,128
for just about the rest of your life.

131
00:17:01,168 --> 00:17:03,797
I don't know why I ever
expected anything from you.

132
00:17:03,847 --> 00:17:06,956
You never help. You just swan off.

133
00:17:07,006 --> 00:17:09,806
To Korea, to your new life in London.

134
00:17:11,325 --> 00:17:14,125
It's all right for you, but the
rest of us have to stay here.

135
00:17:15,205 --> 00:17:17,794
Korea was a war, not a bloody holiday!

136
00:17:17,844 --> 00:17:20,443
Are you going to help save
Daddy from Gwenda, yes or no?

137
00:17:21,803 --> 00:17:22,843
No.

138
00:17:24,283 --> 00:17:25,482
Jack would have done it.

139
00:17:27,042 --> 00:17:28,392
Jack's not here.

140
00:17:28,442 --> 00:17:29,522
<Mickey?

141
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,230
Dear boy!

142
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,510
My best man.

143
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:41,589
Mary, isn't this
wonderful? He's come home.

144
00:17:41,639 --> 00:17:42,759
Wonderful...

145
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:46,108
This gathering tonight,

146
00:17:46,158 --> 00:17:49,147
I absolutely will not
mind if you slope off.

147
00:17:49,197 --> 00:17:50,587
There are so many people to thank

148
00:17:50,637 --> 00:17:53,317
and since the wedding itself
is only going to be us...

149
00:17:54,836 --> 00:17:57,066
Do you think it's too soon?

150
00:17:57,116 --> 00:17:59,785
- The party?
- Me marrying again.

151
00:17:59,835 --> 00:18:02,705
Mary's not taking it particularly well.

152
00:18:02,755 --> 00:18:04,554
She didn't say anything to me.

153
00:18:05,914 --> 00:18:08,353
I'm... I'm happy for you.

154
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:11,863
That means a great deal, you know.

155
00:18:11,913 --> 00:18:13,392
A very great deal.

156
00:18:14,712 --> 00:18:16,742
Hester is giddy to see you.

157
00:18:16,792 --> 00:18:19,071
- Prepare yourself for
an onslaught. - Yes.

158
00:18:27,869 --> 00:18:30,169
It wouldn't have been the
same without you, son.

159
00:18:31,389 --> 00:18:32,548
I've missed you.

160
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:36,068
Very much.

161
00:18:39,547 --> 00:18:41,387
A good bath, tea and straight to bed.

162
00:18:43,946 --> 00:18:45,026
Ah.

163
00:18:46,905 --> 00:18:48,385
And this is your new daddy.

164
00:18:50,105 --> 00:18:51,145
Hello.

165
00:18:54,624 --> 00:18:55,904
Come along.

166
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:10,890
I say, I do hope that's not THE dress.

167
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,810
No, that's going to the
hotel on the morning

168
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,889
- so there's no danger of Leo seeing it.
- We saw it, though.

169
00:19:15,939 --> 00:19:18,409
It's white and that's all I'm saying.

170
00:19:18,459 --> 00:19:20,288
- Look who's here.
- Oh!

171
00:19:22,018 --> 00:19:23,648
Door, Hester, please.

172
00:19:23,698 --> 00:19:26,967
- But Mickey... - Will still be
there when you've answered the door.

173
00:19:27,017 --> 00:19:29,367
Michael, the tailor is coming tomorrow

174
00:19:29,417 --> 00:19:31,566
to make sure your morning suit fits.

175
00:19:31,616 --> 00:19:34,925
Hello, by the way. I'm so
glad that you could make it.

176
00:19:34,975 --> 00:19:36,925
Do you ever stop talking?

177
00:19:36,975 --> 00:19:39,045
You're very early.
Where's your instrument?

178
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:40,644
My instrument?

179
00:19:40,694 --> 00:19:43,774
Your cello. And I do hope you
have something smarter to wear.

180
00:19:44,973 --> 00:19:46,843
- No, I...
- Oh, for God's sake.

181
00:19:46,893 --> 00:19:49,242
What is the matter with people?
This is a formal occasion.

182
00:19:49,292 --> 00:19:51,722
We can find something for him to wear.

183
00:19:51,772 --> 00:19:54,001
I'm not a musician.

184
00:19:54,051 --> 00:19:56,681
I'm Arthur Calgary.

185
00:19:56,731 --> 00:19:59,130
The man in the car.

186
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:02,970
I'm Jack Argyll's alibi.

187
00:20:40,802 --> 00:20:42,921
My apologies for keeping you waiting.

188
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,599
My family are very...

189
00:20:52,879 --> 00:20:54,629
.. shocked.

190
00:20:54,679 --> 00:20:55,759
Understandably so.

191
00:20:57,918 --> 00:20:59,788
You're an Egyptologist.

192
00:20:59,838 --> 00:21:03,277
- A gentleman amateur.
- Oh. Most of them are, aren't they?

193
00:21:10,396 --> 00:21:11,825
Mr Calgary...

194
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:14,305
It's Doctor, actually.

195
00:21:14,355 --> 00:21:16,824
Not that I set particular store by titles.

196
00:21:16,874 --> 00:21:20,833
And not a doctor of
medicine. Science. Physics.

197
00:21:21,993 --> 00:21:24,183
Does that have a bearing
on this situation?

198
00:21:24,233 --> 00:21:26,192
It does, actually, yes.

199
00:21:28,312 --> 00:21:30,831
I came across this only very recently.

200
00:21:31,831 --> 00:21:34,390
And recognised him straightaway.

201
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:38,620
It was Christmas Eve
1954 he flagged me down

202
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:41,509
and I gave him a lift to the local town.

203
00:21:42,949 --> 00:21:45,218
I dropped him off outside
the public house.

204
00:21:45,268 --> 00:21:48,338
I asked him for the time.
I've never worn a watch.

205
00:21:48,388 --> 00:21:49,777
I'm late for everything.

206
00:21:49,827 --> 00:21:51,297
He told me it was just before nine,

207
00:21:51,347 --> 00:21:53,856
but it says here that your wife was...

208
00:21:53,906 --> 00:21:56,586
That she... died just before nine.

209
00:21:57,786 --> 00:22:00,695
But that's when your son was
with me some distance away, so...

210
00:22:00,745 --> 00:22:04,854
Where were you going when Jack
stopped you? What were you late for?

211
00:22:04,904 --> 00:22:07,254
A dinner party.

212
00:22:07,304 --> 00:22:11,263
I'm afraid the cliche about
absent-minded scientists is true.

213
00:22:15,502 --> 00:22:18,461
It's been 18 months since my wife was...

214
00:22:19,781 --> 00:22:22,221
.. killed. Why have you
not come forward before?

215
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,540
I went away for my work.

216
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:28,889
Just after Christmas.

217
00:22:28,939 --> 00:22:30,899
A research station in the Arctic.

218
00:22:34,218 --> 00:22:38,287
- The Arctic? - That's why I didn't see
any papers, hear any radio reports.

219
00:22:38,337 --> 00:22:39,847
I only got back in the last few days,

220
00:22:39,897 --> 00:22:42,126
and if this hadn't been
wrapped around some equipment,

221
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:43,766
I wouldn't have known anything at all.

222
00:22:43,816 --> 00:22:46,965
You were going to a dinner party,
so you were wearing a dinner jacket?

223
00:22:47,015 --> 00:22:50,205
- That's right.
- I just want to be absolutely clear.

224
00:22:50,255 --> 00:22:53,644
A dinner suit. Black tie,
black jacket, black trousers?

225
00:22:53,694 --> 00:22:57,603
I wish I could have got here
sooner, but I'm here now,

226
00:22:57,653 --> 00:23:00,403
and I'm willing to go on oath in court.

227
00:23:00,453 --> 00:23:04,802
So your son con be released because
this terrible crime, Mr Argyll,

228
00:23:04,852 --> 00:23:06,761
he didn't do it.

229
00:23:06,811 --> 00:23:10,001
We've had a lot of people coming
here claiming to be Jack's alibi,

230
00:23:10,051 --> 00:23:12,450
to know something about
him, about our family.

231
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:16,369
All those claims proved fraudulent.

232
00:23:17,489 --> 00:23:18,959
Well, obviously.

233
00:23:19,009 --> 00:23:21,958
Psychics, tarot readers.

234
00:23:22,008 --> 00:23:24,837
A water diviner turned up once.

235
00:23:24,887 --> 00:23:26,237
With rods.

236
00:23:26,287 --> 00:23:29,127
Greedy, venal people.

237
00:23:30,806 --> 00:23:33,356
Fame seekers and charlatans.

238
00:23:33,406 --> 00:23:37,245
You can imagine the hurt
and distress that caused us.

239
00:23:38,405 --> 00:23:40,114
It must have been awful,

240
00:23:40,164 --> 00:23:42,644
but I just want to do what's right.

241
00:23:43,764 --> 00:23:45,473
Jack was in my car.

242
00:23:45,523 --> 00:23:47,233
He's innocent.

243
00:23:47,283 --> 00:23:50,642
Well, once again, you're too late.

244
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:58,200
Jack died in prison before
the case could come to trial.

245
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:05,159
He died?

246
00:24:08,838 --> 00:24:10,438
He can't be dead. He...

247
00:24:12,078 --> 00:24:13,837
He has to be alive. He...

248
00:24:16,077 --> 00:24:17,436
He died how?

249
00:24:19,956 --> 00:24:22,315
He got into a fight with another inmate.

250
00:24:23,515 --> 00:24:25,865
Jack was a difficult young man.

251
00:24:25,915 --> 00:24:28,904
We loved him, but he was difficult.

252
00:24:28,954 --> 00:24:29,994
Disturbed.

253
00:24:32,673 --> 00:24:34,113
We hope he's at peace now.

254
00:24:41,192 --> 00:24:44,671
And I hope you'll leave us
to our own hard-won peace.

255
00:25:21,023 --> 00:25:22,893
I'm so sorry.

256
00:25:22,943 --> 00:25:24,572
Really.

257
00:25:24,622 --> 00:25:26,892
- So dreadfully sorry.
- Actually, we're all rather busy,

258
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:29,461
- so if you wouldn't mind...
- Yes, of course.

259
00:25:30,621 --> 00:25:34,330
I don't suppose you know of any
hotels or boarding houses nearby?

260
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:37,250
There's a hotel in town.
Good day, Doctor Calgary.

261
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:39,819
Don't come back. There's
nothing for you here.

262
00:25:44,298 --> 00:25:46,528
No more information than
he'd read in the newspaper,

263
00:25:46,578 --> 00:25:50,087
like all the others. He said
he was wearing a dinner jacket

264
00:25:50,137 --> 00:25:51,567
so we know he was lying.

265
00:25:51,617 --> 00:25:53,926
I thought this had stopped.

266
00:25:53,976 --> 00:25:56,486
Why won't these ghouls
just leave us alone?

267
00:25:56,536 --> 00:25:57,965
He told me he's a physicist

268
00:25:58,015 --> 00:26:02,165
who's only just returned from
an expedition to the Arctic,

269
00:26:02,215 --> 00:26:04,734
which has got to be one
of the best ones yet.

270
00:26:05,974 --> 00:26:09,003
Forget about him. This
is not going to shake us.

271
00:26:09,053 --> 00:26:10,963
Hester, take those boxes upstairs.

272
00:26:11,013 --> 00:26:13,772
Kirsten, we'll have tea on the lawn.

273
00:26:16,612 --> 00:26:18,281
I'll take mine in my room.

274
00:26:18,331 --> 00:26:20,251
As you wish, Lieutenant Durrant.

275
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:28,639
Strange turning up like
that out of the blue

276
00:26:28,689 --> 00:26:30,239
all this time later.

277
00:26:30,289 --> 00:26:32,278
Very... strange.

278
00:26:32,328 --> 00:26:35,278
Like my dad said, forget about him.

279
00:26:35,328 --> 00:26:37,437
Well, I'm sure we'll all give it a try,

280
00:26:37,487 --> 00:26:39,637
but it brings it all back, doesn't it?

281
00:26:39,687 --> 00:26:41,086
Like it was yesterday.

282
00:26:42,246 --> 00:26:44,286
Your poor, dear mother.

283
00:26:47,205 --> 00:26:48,125
"Butter".

284
00:26:49,325 --> 00:26:51,074
There are two Ts, Michael.

285
00:26:51,124 --> 00:26:54,034
Two of them. Christina can do it.

286
00:26:54,084 --> 00:26:55,124
Butter.

287
00:26:57,443 --> 00:26:59,273
Why can't you?

288
00:26:59,323 --> 00:27:00,362
Butter.

289
00:27:01,482 --> 00:27:02,962
But'er.

290
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:06,081
Stand up.

291
00:27:07,241 --> 00:27:08,761
Look me in the eye and say it.

292
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:12,880
But'er.

293
00:27:16,919 --> 00:27:17,959
Give me that.

294
00:27:23,158 --> 00:27:25,707
Kirsten, Michael has had a little mishap.

295
00:27:25,757 --> 00:27:29,076
A dab of disinfectant
and a plaster, I think.

296
00:27:34,715 --> 00:27:36,865
Mary, your French composition.

297
00:29:22,493 --> 00:29:24,242
Don't.

298
00:29:24,292 --> 00:29:25,962
Jack always said he was innocent.

299
00:29:26,012 --> 00:29:29,491
I'd say the same if I'd
been charged with murder.

300
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:36,800
When we were standing around his coffin

301
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:39,749
and they'd had to cover most of
his face so we couldn't see...

302
00:29:41,929 --> 00:29:44,678
.. what had been done to
him, how he'd been hurt,

303
00:29:44,728 --> 00:29:48,437
you didn't once think, "What
if Jack was telling the truth?"

304
00:29:51,207 --> 00:29:52,926
- No.
- Well, I did.

305
00:29:54,406 --> 00:29:56,246
I do. I think about it all the time.

306
00:29:57,446 --> 00:30:00,595
What if Jack was telling the
truth? What if he was innocent?

307
00:30:00,645 --> 00:30:03,764
- What if he had an alibi? What
if Dr Calgary... - Was lying.

308
00:30:05,004 --> 00:30:06,674
Leave it.

309
00:30:06,724 --> 00:30:09,593
You going on won't change
anything or bring anyone back.

310
00:30:09,643 --> 00:30:12,472
Tina! It's about time. I'm beside myself.

311
00:30:12,522 --> 00:30:15,112
We need help with the tables.

312
00:30:15,162 --> 00:30:17,791
Can you make sure they all
have the little lamps on them?

313
00:30:17,841 --> 00:30:19,281
Poor Tina.

314
00:30:20,601 --> 00:30:23,720
That's why I hide up here,
so they can't make me help.

315
00:30:27,639 --> 00:30:28,679
Where are you going?

316
00:30:29,799 --> 00:30:32,428
- Get some cigarettes.
- There's cigarettes in the store cupboard.

317
00:30:32,478 --> 00:30:33,988
Not the ones I like.

318
00:30:53,114 --> 00:30:55,263
I'm not cross, Hester.

319
00:30:55,313 --> 00:30:57,943
- You're not?
- It's Christmas Eve.

320
00:30:57,993 --> 00:30:59,633
How can I be cross?

321
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:10,460
Well, of course, I saw
through him immediately.

322
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:12,500
If you're going to pretend to be a doctor,

323
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:14,259
don't dress as a caricature of one.

324
00:31:14,309 --> 00:31:17,869
A tweed suit and winter brogues
in July? It's ridiculous.

325
00:31:20,108 --> 00:31:22,698
- What did he say?
- Oh, the usual.

326
00:31:22,748 --> 00:31:24,467
Daddy dealt with him.

327
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:28,816
Look at her, pointing at
flowers as if she's the Queen.

328
00:31:28,866 --> 00:31:31,536
You know, I thought
Mickey might help for once

329
00:31:31,586 --> 00:31:33,815
but he only cares about himself.

330
00:31:33,865 --> 00:31:36,215
Is her dress really white?

331
00:31:36,265 --> 00:31:39,734
- Ivory.
- Ivory! It's the same as white!

332
00:31:39,784 --> 00:31:41,974
This is unbearable!

333
00:31:42,024 --> 00:31:43,373
How can you go along with it?

334
00:31:43,423 --> 00:31:46,173
Bending over backwards
to be her new best friend.

335
00:31:46,223 --> 00:31:49,332
Why doesn't it kill you like it kills me?

336
00:31:49,382 --> 00:31:50,542
Because it doesn't.

337
00:31:52,102 --> 00:31:53,651
Well...

338
00:31:53,701 --> 00:31:55,061
I was the first.

339
00:31:56,461 --> 00:31:58,180
I loved Mother longest.

340
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:01,940
- Mother... - Always pulling
at me! It's intolerable.

341
00:32:06,619 --> 00:32:08,138
It's different for you.

342
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:11,408
It's not different for me.

343
00:32:11,458 --> 00:32:13,257
You think you were the favourite...

344
00:32:14,977 --> 00:32:16,417
.. but you weren't.

345
00:32:18,576 --> 00:32:20,416
Mother just felt sorry for you.

346
00:32:28,094 --> 00:32:30,014
Filth! Filth! Filth!

347
00:34:06,434 --> 00:34:09,063
'.. Against fire and radioactive fallout.

348
00:34:09,113 --> 00:34:11,223
And if you don't have one of those,

349
00:34:11,273 --> 00:34:14,502
then simply place a door
against a wall inside your house

350
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:17,541
as an extra precaution for
yourself and your family

351
00:34:17,591 --> 00:34:21,140
until the police or Civil
Defence Corps arrive

352
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:23,060
to tell you the danger is passed.

353
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:25,060
If you are outside,

354
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:27,339
then simply lie down.

355
00:34:27,389 --> 00:34:29,219
It is inadvisable to smoke,

356
00:34:29,269 --> 00:34:31,818
so keep your cigarettes in your pocket

357
00:34:31,868 --> 00:34:34,258
until you hear the all-clear siren.

358
00:34:34,308 --> 00:34:35,897
I want to remind everyone

359
00:34:35,947 --> 00:34:37,977
that although Great
Britain does face a threat

360
00:34:38,027 --> 00:34:40,456
from unscrupulous foreign powers...

361
00:34:54,264 --> 00:34:55,943
Sh. No, no, no.

362
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:12,780
Who are you?

363
00:35:14,299 --> 00:35:16,769
Arthur Calgary, Dr Arthur Calgary.

364
00:35:16,819 --> 00:35:19,058
Well, you don't have
anything that proves it.

365
00:35:20,058 --> 00:35:21,498
No.

366
00:35:22,898 --> 00:35:24,337
How did you do that?

367
00:35:25,857 --> 00:35:30,736
I got brambles caught in my
trousers. The thorns, they...

368
00:35:32,696 --> 00:35:35,925
Tell me the story, the
one you told my dad.

369
00:35:35,975 --> 00:35:38,214
- It's not a story.
- Tell it anyway.

370
00:35:39,854 --> 00:35:42,364
- I was driving.
- What sort of car?

371
00:35:42,414 --> 00:35:44,603
- I don't really know about cars.
- Describe it.

372
00:35:44,653 --> 00:35:46,523
- I don't...
- Big?

373
00:35:46,573 --> 00:35:48,362
Small?

374
00:35:48,412 --> 00:35:50,322
Big, I suppose.

375
00:35:50,372 --> 00:35:51,412
You suppose?

376
00:35:52,491 --> 00:35:54,401
Where is it now?

377
00:35:54,451 --> 00:35:55,951
Because you didn't drive here.

378
00:35:57,490 --> 00:35:58,970
I don't have it any more.

379
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:02,809
Go on.

380
00:36:04,369 --> 00:36:07,078
- I was driving...
- In the car that you don't know

381
00:36:07,128 --> 00:36:08,798
whether it was big or small?

382
00:36:08,848 --> 00:36:10,638
- Yes.
- That you don't have any more?

383
00:36:10,688 --> 00:36:14,087
- Driving on the road that goes past your house.
- How fast were you going?

384
00:36:15,327 --> 00:36:16,596
Quite slowly.

385
00:36:21,845 --> 00:36:23,275
Go on.

386
00:36:23,325 --> 00:36:26,034
Driving on the road
that goes past your house

387
00:36:26,084 --> 00:36:27,794
and this man stepped out into the road

388
00:36:27,844 --> 00:36:29,554
and put his hands up to ask for a lift.

389
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:32,353
I stopped and gave him a
lift -- your brother, Jack.

390
00:36:32,403 --> 00:36:36,072
And we drove on and I dropped
him off outside a pub.

391
00:36:36,122 --> 00:36:39,322
I asked him for the time
and I went on my way.

392
00:36:43,481 --> 00:36:46,510
How come you don't have
anything that proves who you are?

393
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,680
You're a driver. Where's your licence?

394
00:36:50,239 --> 00:36:51,679
I don't know.

395
00:36:52,679 --> 00:36:54,588
Did you lose it?

396
00:36:54,638 --> 00:36:56,318
In the Arctic?

397
00:36:57,918 --> 00:36:59,517
I might have done.

398
00:37:00,517 --> 00:37:02,437
Did it get eaten by a penguin?

399
00:37:03,957 --> 00:37:05,346
Penguins don't live in the Arctic,

400
00:37:05,396 --> 00:37:07,306
they live in the southern hemisphere.

401
00:37:11,955 --> 00:37:15,304
- Don't take the piss out of me.
- I'm not, I'm just pointing out a fact.

402
00:37:15,354 --> 00:37:17,584
I need you to do something.

403
00:37:17,634 --> 00:37:19,233
I need you to go.

404
00:37:20,433 --> 00:37:23,952
Because we've had enough of people
like you, we've really had enough.

405
00:37:25,432 --> 00:37:26,952
It's important you get that.

406
00:37:29,191 --> 00:37:31,821
Don't be here tomorrow.

407
00:37:31,871 --> 00:37:33,940
And don't go talking to
anyone else around here.

408
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:35,230
Remember...

409
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:38,349
.. I can get in.

410
00:38:15,022 --> 00:38:16,781
You can't go out.

411
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:23,460
Darling...

412
00:38:25,899 --> 00:38:30,209
.. an evening spent in the
company of your father's friends

413
00:38:30,259 --> 00:38:33,208
and their bloated-pig wives

414
00:38:33,258 --> 00:38:35,247
braying over my head

415
00:38:35,297 --> 00:38:38,777
while my face is at crotch level...

416
00:38:40,656 --> 00:38:42,056
Not my idea of fun.

417
00:38:43,416 --> 00:38:47,055
I'm just going to go out and have
a quiet supper in town, all right?

418
00:38:49,255 --> 00:38:50,494
Oh.

419
00:39:05,691 --> 00:39:07,131
Ah, yes.

420
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:12,970
Now, you won't drink too much, will you?

421
00:39:20,888 --> 00:39:22,808
You look very pretty.

422
00:39:25,847 --> 00:39:28,636
Don't let any of the men
flirt with you, will you?

423
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:32,286
I'll see you later.

424
00:39:38,884 --> 00:39:41,964
Hm. Hm, hm, hm.

425
00:39:55,681 --> 00:39:57,480
Oh!

426
00:40:06,958 --> 00:40:09,588
I'm honestly not trying to
take your mother's place, Mary.

427
00:40:09,638 --> 00:40:12,427
I'd like us to be friends.

428
00:40:12,477 --> 00:40:15,906
We could have shopping trips, lunches.

429
00:40:15,956 --> 00:40:17,196
Just us girls.

430
00:40:20,795 --> 00:40:22,475
I don't want to be your friend.

431
00:40:23,915 --> 00:40:27,224
And as for taking my poor mother's place,

432
00:40:27,274 --> 00:40:29,314
with your elocution lessons and...

433
00:40:30,513 --> 00:40:32,223
.. your padded brassieres,

434
00:40:32,273 --> 00:40:34,433
you don't have a chance.

435
00:40:38,512 --> 00:40:43,271
Well, look at you, playing the
adoring, heartbroken daughter.

436
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:46,830
"My poor mother."

437
00:40:50,589 --> 00:40:54,628
The thing is, no-one
hated her more than you.

438
00:41:08,346 --> 00:41:11,025
- Well, it looks like real gold.
- Shut up.

439
00:41:15,424 --> 00:41:17,784
Here she comes, Mother Superior.

440
00:41:20,943 --> 00:41:22,733
Thank you.

441
00:41:22,783 --> 00:41:24,652
What are you doing?

442
00:41:24,702 --> 00:41:26,612
You've got guests.

443
00:41:26,662 --> 00:41:29,411
It's just that it's my last evening
here, so I thought I'd just...

444
00:41:29,461 --> 00:41:32,091
You need to change into your
going-away outfit while your husband

445
00:41:32,141 --> 00:41:34,170
is still sober enough to
walk you out of the house.

446
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:37,319
What's the rush? Why can't she just
sit here with us if she wants to?

447
00:41:39,419 --> 00:41:40,929
Because it doesn't look right.

448
00:41:40,979 --> 00:41:43,738
And that's what matters,
is it, "looking right"?

449
00:41:44,818 --> 00:41:47,207
Look, it won't take me a moment to change.

450
00:41:47,257 --> 00:41:49,337
You are happy for me, Mother, aren't you?

451
00:41:50,737 --> 00:41:54,336
Such hot, little hands!
You'll mark my suit. Come on.

452
00:42:02,374 --> 00:42:03,734
Don't.

453
00:42:05,734 --> 00:42:07,533
One day...

454
00:42:10,613 --> 00:42:12,932
One day just to crack the shell.

455
00:42:14,412 --> 00:42:16,011
See if there's anything inside.

456
00:42:36,767 --> 00:42:38,167
Don't!

457
00:42:49,324 --> 00:42:50,624
We can't avoid each other.

458
00:42:52,084 --> 00:42:54,323
So, we should probably make an effort.

459
00:42:57,723 --> 00:42:59,242
Don't come back.

460
00:43:07,961 --> 00:43:09,480
I suppose we should.

461
00:43:19,838 --> 00:43:21,398
One tiny, little push.

462
00:43:25,677 --> 00:43:27,037
Go ahead.

463
00:43:47,232 --> 00:43:48,702
Ah.

464
00:43:48,752 --> 00:43:50,182
Doctor Calgary.

465
00:43:50,232 --> 00:43:52,381
I apologise for not
coming to find you myself

466
00:43:52,431 --> 00:43:55,861
but I'm not as good at
the stairs as I once was.

467
00:43:55,911 --> 00:43:57,300
We weren't introduced earlier.

468
00:43:57,350 --> 00:44:00,390
I am Flight Lieutenant Durrant,
but please call me Philip.

469
00:44:01,829 --> 00:44:03,459
- Arthur.
- Arthur.

470
00:44:03,509 --> 00:44:05,219
I'd like to buy you dinner.

471
00:44:05,269 --> 00:44:08,498
I thought that at least one person
in the family should be hospitable.

472
00:44:08,548 --> 00:44:09,748
What do you say?

473
00:44:11,747 --> 00:44:12,817
Thank you.

474
00:44:12,867 --> 00:44:14,387
Thank you, sir.

475
00:44:17,186 --> 00:44:18,776
It's funny, isn't it?

476
00:44:18,826 --> 00:44:23,465
How some murders fly right under
the radar and no-one really cares...

477
00:44:24,505 --> 00:44:27,734
.. and others make a lot of noise.

478
00:44:27,784 --> 00:44:29,214
Although let's face it,

479
00:44:29,264 --> 00:44:32,213
"Perfect mother beaten to
death by her adopted son"

480
00:44:32,263 --> 00:44:33,893
is a newspaper man's dream,

481
00:44:33,943 --> 00:44:38,492
really makes you sit up over
your toast and marmalade.

482
00:44:38,542 --> 00:44:41,851
Especially when the perfect
mother is an heiress.

483
00:44:41,901 --> 00:44:43,571
Jack was adopted?

484
00:44:43,621 --> 00:44:45,570
Yes, God, yes, they all are.

485
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:49,529
Even the maid is from
some dismal foundling home,

486
00:44:49,579 --> 00:44:52,809
they couldn't have children of their own

487
00:44:52,859 --> 00:44:56,608
so they filled the house
with little unwanteds.

488
00:44:56,658 --> 00:45:00,137
Landed with their bums in the
butter with all that Argyll money.

489
00:45:01,697 --> 00:45:03,167
Not that I see any of it.

490
00:45:03,217 --> 00:45:06,136
They keep me on very short commons.

491
00:45:07,656 --> 00:45:10,365
Every man gets himself into a bit of debt,

492
00:45:10,415 --> 00:45:13,044
you'd think they'd be only
too happy to help a chap out.

493
00:45:13,094 --> 00:45:16,284
A flying ace, decorated,

494
00:45:16,334 --> 00:45:18,383
I'm a bloody hero.

495
00:45:18,933 --> 00:45:22,283
The whole world tilted
on my wing, I was...

496
00:45:27,132 --> 00:45:28,611
I was a god.

497
00:45:30,091 --> 00:45:31,331
Now...

498
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:35,240
Now I piss in a bottle.

499
00:45:40,089 --> 00:45:41,569
Cheers.

500
00:45:43,288 --> 00:45:45,038
I tip them extra.

501
00:45:45,088 --> 00:45:46,278
Don't I?!

502
00:45:49,527 --> 00:45:51,276
Yes, I'd only got out of hospital

503
00:45:51,326 --> 00:45:53,436
the night before Rachel's sad demise.

504
00:45:53,486 --> 00:45:57,275
I wrote the car off on the
way back from the races.

505
00:45:57,325 --> 00:45:58,845
Broke my back.

506
00:46:00,445 --> 00:46:01,764
I'm sorry.

507
00:46:03,444 --> 00:46:04,684
So am I.

508
00:46:14,882 --> 00:46:17,271
Wonderful spread, Kirsten.

509
00:46:17,321 --> 00:46:20,480
- Thank you, Chief Constable.
- You always feed us so well.

510
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:25,909
Things are bound to change
under the new Mrs Argyll,

511
00:46:25,959 --> 00:46:30,438
if it gets difficult, you just
let me know. I have Leo's ear.

512
00:46:32,038 --> 00:46:33,348
Difficult?

513
00:46:33,398 --> 00:46:36,787
I wouldn't like to see you get side-lined

514
00:46:36,837 --> 00:46:39,236
when you were so devoted to Rachel.

515
00:46:58,952 --> 00:47:02,232
So, what were you doing
in the Arctic, then?

516
00:47:04,231 --> 00:47:06,941
I'm not able to discuss my work.

517
00:47:06,991 --> 00:47:09,590
You were a military
man, you will understand.

518
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:14,549
Official secrets, hm?

519
00:47:16,989 --> 00:47:18,818
Well, you're right to keep quiet,

520
00:47:18,868 --> 00:47:21,258
you never know who's listening these days

521
00:47:21,308 --> 00:47:23,857
and all after the same thing.

522
00:47:27,866 --> 00:47:30,176
Jack's brother came to see me.

523
00:47:30,226 --> 00:47:33,095
Mickey? And what did he want?

524
00:47:33,145 --> 00:47:37,254
He suggested that I
leave and not come back.

525
00:47:37,304 --> 00:47:40,014
How typically charming of him!

526
00:47:40,064 --> 00:47:41,104
And...

527
00:47:43,263 --> 00:47:46,133
.. are you going to go
away and never come back?

528
00:47:46,183 --> 00:47:47,812
I don't see what else I can do.

529
00:47:47,862 --> 00:47:49,932
Jack's dead.

530
00:47:49,982 --> 00:47:51,741
I can't do any good here.

531
00:47:53,221 --> 00:47:55,930
There is an awful lot of
good that you can do here.

532
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:59,810
- What do you mean?
- You're going to stick around, Arthur.

533
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:03,129
Tell your version of events and
let the rumour mill do the rest.

534
00:48:03,179 --> 00:48:05,648
A place like this, suspicions run riot.

535
00:48:05,698 --> 00:48:08,218
The whole bloody family are suspects.

536
00:48:09,538 --> 00:48:12,527
Which one of them's got
blood on their hands?

537
00:48:12,577 --> 00:48:14,337
So deliciously squalid.

538
00:48:48,569 --> 00:48:50,199
You're leaving, Jack.

539
00:48:50,249 --> 00:48:51,769
God almighty, Mother.

540
00:49:00,887 --> 00:49:03,436
Jack killed Rachel, all right.

541
00:49:03,486 --> 00:49:05,966
He was a nasty, little bastard.

542
00:49:07,606 --> 00:49:09,715
A demon seed.

543
00:49:09,765 --> 00:49:11,915
- But he didn't.
- Yes, he did. Of course, he did,

544
00:49:11,965 --> 00:49:14,354
His fingerprints were all
over the murder weapon,

545
00:49:14,404 --> 00:49:17,433
the whisky decanter, which weighed
a bloody tonne, I can assure you.

546
00:49:17,483 --> 00:49:19,633
No, no, no, he got what was coming to him.

547
00:49:19,683 --> 00:49:23,192
But people starting to think
that it might not have been him

548
00:49:23,242 --> 00:49:25,352
works very well for us.

549
00:49:25,402 --> 00:49:29,761
- What do you mean?
- Well, if a newspaper picks it up...

550
00:49:30,761 --> 00:49:32,990
.. lawyers get interested.

551
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:35,550
I feed you all the information that I have

552
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:37,389
and together we stir the pot.

553
00:49:37,439 --> 00:49:39,749
And if Leo Argyll wants you gone --

554
00:49:39,799 --> 00:49:41,548
and he bloody well will --

555
00:49:41,598 --> 00:49:43,188
he'll have to pay.

556
00:49:43,238 --> 00:49:44,948
And pay big.

557
00:49:44,998 --> 00:49:46,997
50-50 split.

558
00:49:48,997 --> 00:49:51,426
That's... That's extortion.

559
00:49:51,476 --> 00:49:53,866
I won't do that.

560
00:49:53,916 --> 00:49:55,705
I can't believe you'd
suggest such a thing,

561
00:49:55,755 --> 00:49:57,825
your own family, when they're grieving.

562
00:49:57,875 --> 00:50:01,224
If I tell a newspaper or a lawyer
anything, it'll be about you.

563
00:50:01,774 --> 00:50:03,634
- Sit down! - Let go of me! - Sit down.

564
00:50:06,793 --> 00:50:09,583
If you're a scientist doing
secret research in the Arctic,

565
00:50:09,633 --> 00:50:11,942
- then I'm a baboon's ball sack.
- That's where I've been!

566
00:50:11,992 --> 00:50:14,062
The sun doesn't set far
north in the midsummer,

567
00:50:14,112 --> 00:50:15,981
you'd have a bit of colour
in your face, but you,

568
00:50:16,031 --> 00:50:18,701
you look like a maggot, like you've
been living under a rotten log.

569
00:50:18,751 --> 00:50:20,940
And, to me, that says one
thing, you've been in prison.

570
00:50:20,990 --> 00:50:23,420
Yes, I'm right, aren't I?
Is that where you met Jack?

571
00:50:23,470 --> 00:50:24,779
- I gave him a lift.
- My arse!

572
00:50:24,829 --> 00:50:26,299
You're a conman. You've been inside,

573
00:50:26,349 --> 00:50:29,019
and one word from me will
have you sent straight back!

574
00:50:29,069 --> 00:50:30,858
Oh, Christ, you look terrified!

575
00:50:30,908 --> 00:50:33,218
What are you so scared about?

576
00:50:33,268 --> 00:50:36,747
He's attacking me! The war hero in
a wheelchair! He's attacking me!

577
00:50:45,265 --> 00:50:49,944
Dear friends, I would like
to say thank you to Gwenda...

578
00:50:51,384 --> 00:50:53,333
.. for agreeing to be my wife.

579
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:54,893
No!

580
00:50:54,943 --> 00:50:57,972
- Which I think is happening
quite soon. - Stop!

581
00:50:59,782 --> 00:51:03,131
And I would like to say thank you...

582
00:51:03,181 --> 00:51:05,211
to my children...

583
00:51:05,261 --> 00:51:07,650
all grown up now...

584
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:09,540
for giving us their blessing.

585
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:12,689
(Smile.)

586
00:51:12,739 --> 00:51:15,089
Thank you for being here.

587
00:51:15,139 --> 00:51:17,288
You have been steadfast

588
00:51:17,338 --> 00:51:23,367
during the most appalling
ordeal any family could endure.

589
00:51:23,417 --> 00:51:29,976
And you have the gratitude of
myself and my children forever.

590
00:52:20,325 --> 00:52:21,885
Can I get a lift?

591
00:52:29,643 --> 00:52:31,123
Well?

592
00:52:32,843 --> 00:52:37,072
The toast I would like
to make is to Rachel.

593
00:52:37,122 --> 00:52:41,471
Wife, mother, a force of nature,

594
00:52:41,521 --> 00:52:43,241
a crusader for good.

595
00:52:50,879 --> 00:52:52,599
Let me go!

596
00:52:53,638 --> 00:52:54,758
Don't!

597
00:53:14,754 --> 00:53:18,543
Do you have the time? I'm
supposed to be there by nine.

598
00:53:18,593 --> 00:53:20,833
Yes, well, it's nearly
that now. So, you're late.

599
00:53:55,985 --> 00:53:58,665
There. There, there.
Sh, sh. There, there...

600
00:54:46,415 --> 00:54:48,284
Rachel.

601
00:54:48,334 --> 00:54:49,974
To Rachel.

602
00:54:52,374 --> 00:54:54,723
We've been through hell. You
don't know what that's like!

603
00:54:54,773 --> 00:54:56,413
I know what hell is like.

604
00:54:58,052 --> 00:54:59,492
Leave me alone!

605
00:55:02,012 --> 00:55:05,161
- Why don't you believe me? I'm
telling you the truth! - Shut up!

606
00:55:05,211 --> 00:55:07,710
I could have killed her
that night for what she did.

607
00:55:09,730 --> 00:55:11,200
Why are you so cruel to me?

608
00:55:11,250 --> 00:55:14,009
It's like kicking a
whipped dog. It's easy.

609
00:55:16,409 --> 00:55:20,608
Jack was innocent, and your
wife's killer is still free.

610
00:55:29,406 --> 00:55:31,355
Do you really not know what you've done?

611
00:55:31,405 --> 00:55:32,995
The bomb you've just dropped?

612
00:55:33,045 --> 00:55:35,005
A bit too old for you, though, aren't I?

613
00:55:37,364 --> 00:55:39,124
You won't break me, Jack.

614
00:55:43,643 --> 00:55:45,203
They're all in on it.

615
00:55:47,602 --> 00:55:51,161
If Jack didn't kill Mother, then who did?

616
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:58,880
Of course it's you.

617
00:55:59,305 --> 00:56:59,731
