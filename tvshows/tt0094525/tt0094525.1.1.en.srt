No.

"Belgravia Overseas Bank
clerk absconds with fortune."

5
00:02:43,361 --> 00:02:45,099
How much is this fortune?

6
00:02:47,494 --> 00:02:48,519
Ninety thousand pounds.

7
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:49,771
No.

8
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:51,871
That's a King's ransom, Poirot!

9
00:02:52,001 --> 00:02:55,937
When it is used to ransom a King,
it becomes interesting to Poirot.

"Missed typist of 21,
where it Edna Field?"

Oh, no.

12
00:03:03,228 --> 00:03:05,093
There's good stuff here, Poirot .

13
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:08,734
Mysterious suicide,
absconding bank clerk, missing typist...

14
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:12,028
Yes, but I am not greatly attracted
to any of them, mon ami.

15
00:03:13,134 --> 00:03:16,046
I have many affairs of importance
of my own to attend to.

16
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:17,173
Such as?

17
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:20,006
My wardrobe, Hastings.

18
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:24,045
If I mistake not, there is on my new
grey suit a spot of grease.

19
00:03:24,323 --> 00:03:25,521
You have noticed it perhaps, non?

20
00:03:26,155 --> 00:03:26,695
No.

21
00:03:27,527 --> 00:03:32,614
Well, it is only the one spot, you understand,
but it is sufficient to trouble me.

22
00:03:33,535 --> 00:03:38,019
Then, there is my winter overcoat.
I must lay him aside in the powder of Keatings.

23
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,411
And I think, ...

24
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:42,644
... yes.

25
00:03:43,254 --> 00:03:45,890
I think the moment is right
for the trimming of the moustache,

26
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:47,525
also the pomading...

[ KNOCK ON DOOR ]

28
00:03:50,455 --> 00:03:52,423
There's a lady to see you, Mr. Poirot.

29
00:03:53,202 --> 00:03:54,050
A lady?

30
00:03:54,161 --> 00:03:56,534
A client, her name is Mrs. Todd.

31
00:03:59,112 --> 00:04:01,972
Unless the affair is one
of national importance,

32
00:04:02,559 --> 00:04:03,736
I touch it not.

33
00:04:04,029 --> 00:04:05,826
I couldn't say, sir.
Shall I ask her?

34
00:04:06,045 --> 00:04:08,704
Then no, no, no, Miss Lemon.
Show Mrs.Todd in.

35
00:04:12,888 --> 00:04:14,662
We shall judge for ourselves, eh Hastings?

36
00:04:15,071 --> 00:04:16,571
Oh, yes, yes.

37
00:04:18,429 --> 00:04:21,667
Mrs. Todd. Doesn't sound
as if she's nationally important.

38
00:04:22,235 --> 00:04:25,449
Mind you, I knew a Mrs. Jones once who was
Master of Hounds with the Mid Rutland.

39
00:04:25,626 --> 00:04:26,259
Yes?

40
00:04:27,218 --> 00:04:30,044
No, that's all.
Funny woman.

41
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:33,734
Mrs. Todd, sir.

42
00:04:33,939 --> 00:04:34,764
Thank you.

43
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:41,130
Oh, a...are you Mr. Poirot?

44
00:04:42,018 --> 00:04:44,390
I am Hercule Poirot, yes Madame.

45
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,941
Oh, you're not a bit how
I thought you'd be.

[ CHUCKLES ]

47
00:04:48,141 --> 00:04:51,179
Did you pay for that bit in the paper saying
what a clever detective you were,

48
00:04:51,204 --> 00:04:53,069
or did they put it in themselves?

49
00:04:55,225 --> 00:04:55,891
Madame...

50
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:57,642
Oh I'm sorry, I'm sure,

51
00:04:57,856 --> 00:05:00,562
but you know what newspapers are
like nowadays, nothing but puff.

52
00:05:01,681 --> 00:05:03,736
But no offence taken, I hope.

53
00:05:07,069 --> 00:05:08,625
I tell you what I want you to do for me.

54
00:05:08,649 --> 00:05:10,418
I want you to find my cook.

55
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:14,466
I fear you are making a mistake, Madame.

56
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:17,519
Hercule Poirot is a private detective.

57
00:05:17,885 --> 00:05:18,825
I know that.

58
00:05:19,171 --> 00:05:21,679
Haven't I just told you I want
you to find my cook for me?

59
00:05:21,806 --> 00:05:23,218
Walked out of the house on Wednesday

60
00:05:23,243 --> 00:05:25,827
without so much as a bye-your-leave
and never came back.

61
00:05:26,313 --> 00:05:30,417
I am sorry Madame, but I do not
touch that particular kind of business.

62
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:33,338
I wish you, good day!

63
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:35,237
So that's it, is it?

64
00:05:35,994 --> 00:05:37,009
Too proud, eh?

65
00:05:37,787 --> 00:05:40,533
Only deal with government secrets
and Countesses' jewels?

66
00:05:41,686 --> 00:05:44,670
Well, let me tell you,
Mr. High-Mighty Poirot.

67
00:05:45,104 --> 00:05:46,437
A good cook's a good cook,

68
00:05:46,946 --> 00:05:48,065
and when you lose one,

69
00:05:48,089 --> 00:05:51,224
it's as much to you
as pearls are to some fine Lady.

70
00:05:57,698 --> 00:06:02,032
Madame, you are in the right
and I am in the wrong.

71
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:05,886
Your remarks are just
and intelligent.

72
00:06:08,457 --> 00:06:10,394
This case will be a novelty, Hastings.

73
00:06:10,802 --> 00:06:13,387
Never before have we
hunted a missing domestic.

74
00:06:13,928 --> 00:06:17,166
Truly here is a problem
of "national importance".

75
00:06:18,145 --> 00:06:20,891
Wonderful! Where do you
reside, Mrs. Todd?

76
00:06:21,823 --> 00:06:24,458
88 Prince Albert Road, Clapham.

77
00:06:34,753 --> 00:06:38,077
You said this jewel of a cook went out
on Wednesday and did not return?

78
00:06:38,102 --> 00:06:39,963
Wednesday, yes, it was her day off.

79
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,202
The day before yesterday.

80
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:45,653
Has it occurred to you Madame, that she
might have met with some accident.

81
00:06:45,849 --> 00:06:47,198
Have you inquired at the hospitals?

82
00:06:47,223 --> 00:06:49,386
That's exactly what I thought yesterday,

83
00:06:49,465 --> 00:06:52,092
but, this morning, if you please,
she sent for her box.

84
00:06:52,449 --> 00:06:52,965
What box?

85
00:06:53,502 --> 00:06:53,994
Her box.

86
00:06:54,567 --> 00:06:57,027
Her trunk. Luggage.

87
00:06:57,569 --> 00:06:58,486
Oh, I see.

88
00:06:59,244 --> 00:07:00,997
Will you describe her to me, Madame?

89
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:04,860
Oh, most respectable.
Ten years in her last place.

90
00:07:05,027 --> 00:07:07,098
Middle age, grey hair, thin.

91
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:08,097
And her name?

92
00:07:08,669 --> 00:07:10,319
Dunn. Eliza Dunn.

93
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,447
This is Clapham, there's the common.

94
00:07:19,351 --> 00:07:19,991
Charming.

95
00:07:23,605 --> 00:07:25,748
You had no disagreement with her
on Wednesday, Madame?

96
00:07:25,846 --> 00:07:28,116
No, that's what makes it all so queer.

97
00:07:28,712 --> 00:07:30,132
How many servants do you keep?

98
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:34,345
Two. Miss Dunn and the
house parlor maid, Annie.

99
00:07:37,866 --> 00:07:40,361
Here we are. There's 88.

100
00:07:41,216 --> 00:07:42,660
All right, driver.

101
00:08:04,865 --> 00:08:05,675
Annie!

102
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,003
Hastings, my friend,

103
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,621
promise me one thing.

104
00:08:10,749 --> 00:08:11,554
What's that, Poirot?

105
00:08:11,622 --> 00:08:13,756
Never, but never

106
00:08:13,939 --> 00:08:17,065
must Chief-Inspector Japp hear
that I investigated such a case.

107
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,694
Mum's the word, old boy.

108
00:08:25,367 --> 00:08:29,724
Now, Annie, this gentleman is a detective,
he wants to ask you a few questions.

109
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:35,180
Here we are, sir.

110
00:08:36,379 --> 00:08:36,815
Ah.

111
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,579
Voyons, Mademoiselle Annie.

112
00:08:43,276 --> 00:08:44,435
Sit yourself.

113
00:08:44,659 --> 00:08:45,403
Thank you, sir.

114
00:08:46,614 --> 00:08:49,693
All that you shall tell us will be of
the greatest importance, Annie.

115
00:08:50,525 --> 00:08:52,857
You alone can shed any light
on the case.

116
00:08:53,088 --> 00:08:55,423
Without you, I can do nothing.

117
00:08:55,448 --> 00:08:58,763
Sir, I'm sure I'll tell you
anything I can, sir.

118
00:08:59,213 --> 00:09:00,015
That is good.

119
00:09:01,095 --> 00:09:01,553
Now...

120
00:09:05,139 --> 00:09:06,099
First of all...

121
00:09:08,476 --> 00:09:09,826
What is your own idea?

122
00:09:10,946 --> 00:09:14,755
You are a girl of remarkable intelligence,
that can be seen at once.

123
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:17,388
But this is a queer thing, eh?

124
00:09:18,202 --> 00:09:21,671
What is your own explanation
of Eliza's disappearance?

125
00:09:22,157 --> 00:09:23,594
White slavers, sir.

126
00:09:24,483 --> 00:09:25,062
Ah!

127
00:09:26,182 --> 00:09:28,095
I said so all along, sir,

128
00:09:28,261 --> 00:09:29,439
only no one will listen.

129
00:09:30,098 --> 00:09:32,289
Cook was always warning me
against them.

130
00:09:32,984 --> 00:09:36,166
"Don't you go snuffing yourself
and eating no sweets,

131
00:09:36,461 --> 00:09:38,667
no matter how gentlemanly were the fellow."

132
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:41,677
Ah, this is something we have
not thought of, Hastings.

133
00:09:41,986 --> 00:09:45,415
No, right.
Good Heavens!

134
00:09:46,772 --> 00:09:48,455
But would she have sent for her trunk?

135
00:09:49,205 --> 00:09:50,332
Beg pardon, sir?

136
00:09:50,546 --> 00:09:52,983
Miss Dunn sent for her trunk, I believe.

137
00:09:53,829 --> 00:09:56,662
Now, if she had truly been
taken by these white slavers,

138
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,846
would she have sent for her luggage?

139
00:10:00,114 --> 00:10:01,377
Well, I don't know, sir.

140
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,760
She'd want her things, wouldn't she?

141
00:10:04,443 --> 00:10:07,014
Even in foreign parts,
she'd want her things.

142
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:07,783
Ah.

143
00:10:09,463 --> 00:10:11,487
Who came for her trunk, Annie?

144
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:12,715
The carriers, sir.

145
00:10:13,008 --> 00:10:14,734
The men from Carter Paterson.

146
00:10:14,884 --> 00:10:16,138
Did you pack it for her?

147
00:10:16,163 --> 00:10:18,797
No sir, it was already
packed and corded.

148
00:10:19,165 --> 00:10:19,729
Ah.

149
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:22,038
That is interesting.

150
00:10:23,985 --> 00:10:26,334
That shows that when she
left the house on Wednesday,

151
00:10:26,549 --> 00:10:29,287
already she determined not to return.

152
00:10:30,867 --> 00:10:32,388
You see that, do you not?

153
00:10:33,342 --> 00:10:35,071
Oh, I'd never thought of that.

154
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:40,140
Tell me now, Annie,

155
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:47,283
what was the very last thing
Eliza said to you before she went out?

156
00:10:48,983 --> 00:10:53,968
She said, "If there's any stewed
peaches left over from the dining room,

157
00:10:54,072 --> 00:10:55,453
"we'll have them for supper,

158
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:58,969
and a bit of bacon and fried potatoes."

159
00:10:59,733 --> 00:11:01,859
Mad for stewed peaches, she was.

160
00:11:03,186 --> 00:11:05,662
I shouldn't wonder if that
was the way they got her.

161
00:11:06,314 --> 00:11:07,003
Got her?

162
00:11:08,066 --> 00:11:09,407

Thank you very much, Annie,

165
00:11:16,905 --> 00:11:18,436
you have been most helpful.

166
00:11:35,304 --> 00:11:36,852
Was she saying things about me?

167
00:11:37,089 --> 00:11:41,380
Not at all. Only things of
the pleasantest nature.

168
00:11:42,547 --> 00:11:45,349
But for a woman
of your intelligence, Madame,

169
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:49,110
it would be tiresome to bear with patience
the round-about methods

170
00:11:49,135 --> 00:11:51,569
we plodding detectives have to use.

171
00:11:51,997 --> 00:11:54,068
Oh,... oh I see.

172
00:11:54,611 --> 00:11:57,975
Well, I wouldn't say there was all that
much difference between us, Mr. Poirot.

173
00:11:58,644 --> 00:12:01,231
I always was very good
in general knowledge at school.

174
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:05,354
There!! And your husband, too,
I'm sure is the intellectual, yes?

175
00:12:05,989 --> 00:12:08,558
Yes, he does very well with figures.

176
00:12:09,001 --> 00:12:10,565
A successful businessman?

177
00:12:10,615 --> 00:12:12,838
With the Prudential, yes, in the city.

178
00:12:14,749 --> 00:12:17,122
What about the other inmates
of the house, Madame?

179
00:12:17,359 --> 00:12:19,598
Oh, you mean Mr. Simpson,
our paying guest?

180
00:12:19,796 --> 00:12:21,201
What is his profession, Madame?

181
00:12:21,766 --> 00:12:25,187
Oh, he's in business too,
with the Belgravia and Overseas Bank.

182
00:12:26,688 --> 00:12:27,815
Young man, is he?

00:12:28,787 --> 00:12:29,890
Twenty eight, I believe.

184
00:12:30,263 --> 00:12:31,388
A nice young fellow.

185
00:12:33,935 --> 00:12:37,190
Well, they'll both be in about six,
if you want to see them.

186
00:12:37,572 --> 00:12:39,284
An excellent suggestion, Madame.

187
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:45,367
Well, my colleague and I will take
a turn on your famous common for...

... one hour.

189
00:12:58,148 --> 00:13:00,736
It's a curious coincidence that
the paying guest Simpson

190
00:13:00,906 --> 00:13:03,454
works in the same bank
as the absconding clerk.

191
00:13:04,881 --> 00:13:06,294
They must have known each other.

192
00:13:07,065 --> 00:13:07,660
Perhaps.

193
00:13:09,487 --> 00:13:13,187
Or possibly Davis visited Simpson,
fell in love with the cook

194
00:13:13,254 --> 00:13:16,071
and he persuaded her to
accompany him on his flight.

Oh yes.

00:13:47,723 --> 00:13:48,540
Indeed?

202
00:13:48,939 --> 00:13:52,403
Well, perhaps you have some theories
about the disappearance of your cook.

203
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:56,998
Theories? No.
It's hardly a crime, is it?

204
00:13:57,514 --> 00:14:01,030
Good cook, her, and economical.
I'm very hot on economy.

00:14:01,164 --> 00:14:02,170
Admirable.

Mr. Simpson, Mrs. Todd has
engaged me to find Eliza Dunn,

226

Oh! Where is she?

00:15:31,752 --> 00:15:33,741
But that is what we do
not know, monsieur.

228
00:15:35,415 --> 00:15:37,153
You know her, of course.

229
00:15:38,114 --> 00:15:39,312
Well er....

230
00:15:40,302 --> 00:15:42,841
I must've met her, I suppose.

231
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:47,444
Well it would seems that Miss Dunn
has not been seen since Wednesday.

232
00:15:49,483 --> 00:15:51,141
Did you see her on that day?

233
00:15:51,969 --> 00:15:53,763
I don't think so.

234
00:15:55,406 --> 00:15:56,263
I don't know.

235
00:15:57,214 --> 00:15:59,793
You were at work as usual, on Wednesday?

236
00:16:00,006 --> 00:16:00,744
Yes.

237
00:16:04,901 --> 00:16:06,433
Well thank you,

Ah!

It was most kind of you
to spare us the time.

240
00:16:15,584 --> 00:16:17,600
Tell me, Mr. Simpson,

241
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:23,176
what does a young fellow find
to do around here, on the evening, hmm?

00:16:23,527 --> 00:16:25,812
Oh, the usual things, you know.

243
00:16:25,863 --> 00:16:29,149
Musical evenings, amateur theatricals,
that kind of things?

244
00:16:29,993 --> 00:16:31,930
Yes, I suppose so.

245
00:16:31,955 --> 00:16:33,917
You do not interest yourself, hmm?

246

Thank you.

I think the husband got
something to do with it.

250
00:16:58,761 --> 00:17:00,101
To do with the missing cook?

251
00:17:00,608 --> 00:17:02,409
There's something about
him I don't trust.

252

Merely because a man
does not offer you a drink, Hastings,

253
00:17:06,135 --> 00:17:09,627
does not mean that he is necessarily
guilty of other crimes.

254
00:17:13,436 --> 00:17:15,848
But, there doesn't seem to be any crime at all,
as far as I can see.

255
00:17:17,054 --> 00:17:19,753
No, it is a curious case,

00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:31,341
Oh yes,

No!

Thirty six hundred of them,

But now is time for work, yes?

Oh yes, Mr. Simpson is an
excellent timekeeper.

To tell the truth, he was absent
on Thursday with a cold.

You have been most helpful,

Glad to be of assistance.

311
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:13,539
It is an unfortunate occurrence,
this business of the Davis' absconding.

312

Oh, you heard about that,
did you?

scarcely miss it.

I am a cook, sir.

480
00:31:19,522 --> 00:31:21,625
Didn't they tell you at the house?

481
00:31:22,481 --> 00:31:26,926
My dear Miss Dunn, I had no idea.

482
00:31:28,227 --> 00:31:31,600
This is very unfortunate.

483
00:31:34,624 --> 00:31:36,745
Will I have to lose the money, sir?

484
00:31:37,284 --> 00:31:39,046
And the house, sir?

485
00:31:40,062 --> 00:31:45,229
That sounds ever nice,
even if it is a bit out of the way.

486
00:31:47,395 --> 00:31:49,062
I believe I have it.

487
00:31:50,856 --> 00:31:53,546
We lawyers,
always know a thing or two.

488
00:31:54,894 --> 00:32:01,001
The way out here is for you to have
left your employment before we met.

489
00:32:01,596 --> 00:32:04,207
But we have met, sir
and I mean no I haven't.

490
00:32:04,683 --> 00:32:05,707
- Haven't you?
- No.

491
00:32:06,976 --> 00:32:09,135
Haven't you, Miss Dunn?

492
00:32:09,159 --> 00:32:10,307
No.

493
00:32:15,314 --> 00:32:17,117
Oh, I see.

494
00:32:18,315 --> 00:32:19,141
Yes.

495
00:32:19,791 --> 00:32:24,680
You left your employment this morning,
did you not? Before we met.

496
00:32:25,132 --> 00:32:28,689
Yes, I remember now.

497
00:32:29,347 --> 00:32:31,443
I did, as a matter of fact.

498
00:32:31,911 --> 00:32:33,173
There.

499
00:32:33,776 --> 00:32:39,268
Now it is imperative that you take possession
of the house by noon tomorrow.

500
00:32:39,474 --> 00:32:43,990
In order to do that, you must catch
the night train from King's Cross.

501
00:32:44,537 --> 00:32:48,617
Come along, Miss Dunn.
I can advance you 10 pounds or so for the fare

502
00:32:48,641 --> 00:32:53,720
and you can write a note to your employer at the
station, which I shall personally deliver for you.

503
00:32:54,046 --> 00:32:55,903
And it's live with you.

504
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:02,819
And was everything as
Mr. Crotchet had said?

Oh yes, and more, sir.

506

Now, what about your luggage?

507
00:33:08,612 --> 00:33:11,135
All the things you had left
at 88, Prince Albert Road?

508
00:33:11,159 --> 00:33:14,405
Oh, well, Mr. Crotchet sent them
on, like he said he would.

509
00:33:15,126 --> 00:33:17,801
But it was all done up
in brown paper, like.

I don't know.

511
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:22,000
I suppose Mrs. Todd
was angry with me, and

512
00:33:22,698 --> 00:33:24,555
and grudged me my bit of luck and

513
00:33:24,745 --> 00:33:26,594
wouldn't let  him have my box.

- Later, my friend. Later.

But there you said
she never got my letter.

517
00:33:36,537 --> 00:33:38,767
Well, I can't say as I blame her.

518
00:33:41,496 --> 00:33:42,317
I see.

Well thank you, Mademoiselle.

Oh.

There has been, as you say,
a little muddle about your trunk,

522
00:33:54,429 --> 00:33:56,444
which I will straighten out
with Mrs. Todd,

523
00:33:56,468 --> 00:33:57,555
if you will permit.

524

Oh, thank you very much, sir.

Come, Hastings.

We must return to London
with all possible speed.

527
00:34:12,975 --> 00:34:15,712
Is there nowhere you can contact
the Chief-Inspector Japp?

528
00:34:17,355 --> 00:34:19,355
Then telephone him at his home.

Yes, of the greatest urgency.

531
00:34:25,012 --> 00:34:27,012
he should be looking for Simpson.

532
00:34:27,465 --> 00:34:30,504
No, not Davis, but Simpson!

533
00:34:52,162 --> 00:34:53,051
Thank you.

534
00:34:55,099 --> 00:34:56,035
Thank you.

535
00:35:00,441 --> 00:35:02,861
Why should Japp want Simpson,
all of a sudden?

536
00:35:03,511 --> 00:35:05,194
What's Simpson suppose to have done?

Hastings, my friend, the little grey cells
are not working today, hey?

They take a little vacances, huh?

539
00:35:19,126 --> 00:35:21,126
It's to do with this Eliza, isn't it?

No.

We have moved beyond the petty sphere
of cooks and club domestics.

There is something to do
with this Australian fellow?

There is no Australian fellow.

Yes, there is.

Oh, right. The lodger, yes.

Do you remember I had asked him if he
took an interest in amateur theatricals?

Yes, I do, as a matter of fact.

Why do you think I asked him that?

Why?

00:36:07,942 --> 00:36:10,958
Well, making conversation, I suppose?

554
00:36:13,878 --> 00:36:17,721
I asked him that because he had
recently been wearing a false beard.

He had a tiny trace

No, no, no, I am not some French gent,

Good morning.

No, but he did not want
a new trunk, mon ami.

He wanted a trunk of pedigree,
a trunk of assured respectability.

00:41:26,892 --> 00:41:28,336
Is he with you?

639
00:41:28,876 --> 00:41:31,550
Whose body? I mean to say, there's going
to be bodies all over the place?

640
00:41:31,574 --> 00:41:34,566
Doucement, Hastings, all will
be revealed to you.

641
00:41:34,732 --> 00:41:36,732
Can we get on
with the business in hand?

642
00:41:37,288 --> 00:41:38,399
By all means.

643
00:41:39,042 --> 00:41:40,677
I saw through it myself, didn't I?

644
00:41:40,827 --> 00:41:44,335
Yesterday morning.
Some cove, with a beard.

645
00:41:44,605 --> 00:41:45,517
Crotchet!

646
00:41:45,541 --> 00:41:46,715
You spoke to this man?

647
00:41:46,739 --> 00:41:47,881
Of course I spoke to him.

648
00:41:47,905 --> 00:41:49,119
Did he give a name?

649
00:41:49,825 --> 00:41:52,881
Nah, he just said this
Eliza Dunn was his aunt

650
00:41:52,905 --> 00:41:55,238
and she wanted the trunk
sent on to Glasgow.

651
00:41:55,881 --> 00:41:57,722
And it's gone,
you have sent it?

652
00:41:57,992 --> 00:42:01,976
Nah, every Friday the Southern Railway
pays me huge amounts of money

653
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
so I won't do
that sort of thing.

654
00:42:04,397 --> 00:42:06,397
I think he's being sarcastic, Poirot.

655
00:42:06,421 --> 00:42:08,992
No, no, Hastings.

656
00:42:09,627 --> 00:42:11,016
He is a good man.

657
00:42:11,469 --> 00:42:14,238
He is doing a job
of great responsibility.

658
00:42:16,785 --> 00:42:18,135
Thank you, monsieur.

659
00:42:20,301 --> 00:42:22,095
I'll tell you one thing, though.

660
00:42:28,514 --> 00:42:31,519
And... what is that, monsieur?

661
00:42:31,908 --> 00:42:33,431
You looking for this bloke
or something?

662
00:42:33,455 --> 00:42:35,455
Well of course we're
looking for him.

663
00:42:35,479 --> 00:42:37,479
I'm talking to the engineer,
not the oil brake.

664
00:42:37,503 --> 00:42:38,463
Now look here...

665
00:42:38,488 --> 00:42:39,694
Hastings!

666
00:42:41,265 --> 00:42:43,813
What is this one thing
you will tell us, monsieur?

667
00:42:45,574 --> 00:42:48,837
All right, I'll tell ya.

668
00:42:50,963 --> 00:42:54,186
I'll tell ya where he is.
There!

669
00:42:56,924 --> 00:42:57,789
Go on.

670
00:42:58,225 --> 00:42:59,582
Well, at least rough figures.

671
00:42:59,606 --> 00:43:00,986
Ah, a bit less sure, now, hey?

672
00:43:01,010 --> 00:43:03,089
I bet he is, I bet he's where I'll say.

673
00:43:03,114 --> 00:43:04,773
And where do you say?

674
00:43:06,693 --> 00:43:08,908
Bolivia, there!

675
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:10,241
Bolivia?

676
00:43:10,662 --> 00:43:12,455
That's in South America.

677
00:43:13,104 --> 00:43:15,994
And what is it that makes you think
that he is in Bolivia?

678
00:43:16,764 --> 00:43:20,414
Well, going there, least on his way, like.

679
00:43:21,827 --> 00:43:24,691
He has to pay for his trunk to be
sent on to Glasgow, see?

680
00:43:25,048 --> 00:43:25,992
I see.

681
00:43:26,595 --> 00:43:30,174
He takes out a wad of notes,
to choke a cow horse, it would.

682
00:43:30,602 --> 00:43:34,515
There's a few English notes there,
which he paid what he owes me with,

683
00:43:35,491 --> 00:43:40,666
but I couldn't help but notice
most of the other notes were Bolivian.

684
00:43:43,419 --> 00:43:47,216
Hastings, this gentleman is a genius.

685
00:43:47,922 --> 00:43:49,652
How do you know they were Bolivian?

686
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,969
Well, one tiny little thing was

687
00:43:54,088 --> 00:43:56,960
they had Bolivia written all
over them, didn't they?

688
00:44:03,396 --> 00:44:05,624
Here we are, this week sailings.

689
00:44:08,548 --> 00:44:09,193
Ah.

690
00:44:10,328 --> 00:44:11,994
Nothing for Bolivia today.

691
00:44:12,359 --> 00:44:14,843
Bolivia is a landlocked
country, Hastings.

692
00:44:14,867 --> 00:44:16,359
Ah, that explains it, then.

693
00:44:16,383 --> 00:44:19,033
One sails to Buenos Aires
and goes by train from there.

694
00:44:19,057 --> 00:44:23,874
What lovely names they all have.
Queen of Heaven sailing for Caracas.

695
00:44:23,898 --> 00:44:26,564
Thank you, Miss Lemon.
Can we stick to Buenos Aires, please?

696
00:44:27,508 --> 00:44:28,865
Ah, here we are!

697
00:44:32,057 --> 00:44:35,668
The S.S. Nevonia,
from Southampton, at 1 a.m.

698
00:44:35,692 --> 00:44:37,152
Well let's go, then!

699
00:44:40,543 --> 00:44:43,364
Are we looking for Simpson,
or the trunk?

700
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:48,261
Simpson, of course.
The trunk is in Glasgow.

701
00:44:48,729 --> 00:44:50,054
But first...

702
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:52,625
Scotland Yard.

703
00:45:05,884 --> 00:45:10,130
And of course you see some sinister
point in all these Arthur Simpson's activities.

704
00:45:10,359 --> 00:45:12,359
Well yes, of course, Chief-Inspector.

705
00:45:12,494 --> 00:45:16,232
Six months rent on a house,
a 150 pounds to Miss Dunn.

706
00:45:16,953 --> 00:45:20,192
It is not much to assure
the success of his plan.

707
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:22,223
And this famous plan is?

708
00:45:22,382 --> 00:45:24,159
I mean, we've heard a lot
about it, Mr. Poirot...

709
00:45:24,183 --> 00:45:25,865
and I'm sure it's been
very entertaining, but...

710
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:27,889
We are wasting time, Chief-Inspector.

711
00:45:30,015 --> 00:45:30,681
Go on, then.

712
00:45:31,118 --> 00:45:36,620
His plan, of course, is to steal 90,000
pounds worth of negotiable securities

713
00:45:36,644 --> 00:45:39,112
from the Belgravia and Overseas Bank.

714
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:43,294
No! That's Davis.

715
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:05,483
Here it is, Sergeant.

716
00:46:05,817 --> 00:46:07,380
[ TELEPHONE RINGS ]

717
00:46:08,427 --> 00:46:10,112
Chief-Inspector Japp speaking.

718
00:46:10,770 --> 00:46:11,921
Ah yes, Sergeant.

719
00:46:13,143 --> 00:46:14,865
Good, good!

720
00:46:15,285 --> 00:46:17,135
It's Glasgow. They found the trunk.

721
00:46:17,555 --> 00:46:18,365
And?

722
00:46:18,849 --> 00:46:20,119
What you mean, and?

723
00:46:20,603 --> 00:46:21,936
Have they opened it?

724
00:46:24,269 --> 00:46:27,467
Sergeant Hendry,
have you opened the trunk?

725
00:46:29,927 --> 00:46:31,617
Ah yes, I see.

726
00:46:32,282 --> 00:46:34,156
Apparently they need a warrant on them.

727
00:46:34,878 --> 00:46:38,275
Mon dieu. There is
a body in that trunk.

728
00:46:40,283 --> 00:46:41,203
A body?

729
00:46:43,877 --> 00:46:47,435
Look, Sergeant, there seems to be
a possibility there's a body in that trunk.

730
00:46:47,966 --> 00:46:49,705
Yes, a dead body.

731
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:51,729
You will?

732
00:46:52,776 --> 00:46:53,753
Right. Thank you.

733
00:46:55,094 --> 00:46:58,445
He thinks that may expedite matters.
He's gonna ring me back.

734
00:46:58,588 --> 00:47:00,913
Now then, what body?
Whose body?

735
00:47:01,444 --> 00:47:02,873
Davis, of course.

736
00:47:03,436 --> 00:47:05,016
This is nonsense, Poirot.

737
00:47:05,222 --> 00:47:09,182
Davis stole those securities from the bank,
Davis is the one that disappeared the day...

738
00:47:10,396 --> 00:47:11,237
Oh, God!

739
00:47:11,832 --> 00:47:13,451
Precisely.

740
00:47:14,347 --> 00:47:17,246
You think what Simpson
wanted you to think.

741
00:47:18,539 --> 00:47:19,825
Listen, Chief-Inspector.

742
00:47:21,341 --> 00:47:26,908
On Wednesday, Simpson, disguised,
decoys away the cook.

743
00:47:27,987 --> 00:47:30,598
Now, he has already removed
the securities from the bank,

744
00:47:30,852 --> 00:47:35,217
but knows this will not be discovered
until Thursday afternoon.

745
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:39,376
Now, he does not go
to the bank on Thursday,

746
00:47:39,574 --> 00:47:42,780
Instead he lies and wait for Davis
when he comes out to lunch

747
00:47:43,303 --> 00:47:45,454
and asks him to come
to Clapham with him.

748
00:47:47,962 --> 00:47:50,081
Now, it is the maids day out.

749
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:52,755
Mrs. Todd is at the shops.

750
00:47:53,747 --> 00:47:55,858
There is no one in the house.

751
00:47:57,294 --> 00:48:00,247
Simpson kills Davis.

752
00:48:11,610 --> 00:48:14,202
The one difficulty for a murderer

753
00:48:14,852 --> 00:48:16,852
is the disposal of the body.

754
00:48:18,241 --> 00:48:22,162
And that is why Simpson wanted
the trunk of Miss Eliza Dunn.

755
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:34,674
And now, if I am not
much mistaken, my friends,

756
00:48:35,094 --> 00:48:38,261
it is here we will apprehend our murderer.

757
00:48:46,599 --> 00:48:48,766
Have I got something wrong,
Chief-Inspector?

758
00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:51,924
No, no, Poirot,
can't be right everytime.

759
00:48:59,621 --> 00:49:01,621
Mon dieu, I am wrong.

760
00:49:02,367 --> 00:49:04,168
I am wrong!

761
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:10,119
Officer! Where does the
Queen of Heaven sail from, tonight?

762
00:49:10,285 --> 00:49:12,373
Why, from pier 5 sir,
over there.

763
00:49:12,873 --> 00:49:14,960
Poirot, where're we going?

764
00:49:15,110 --> 00:49:17,698
The Queen of the Heaven
sails for Caracas tonight.

765
00:49:18,063 --> 00:49:20,063
I remember it from The Times.

766
00:49:23,792 --> 00:49:26,365
Yes, but Caracas isn't
in Bolivia, is it?

767
00:49:26,736 --> 00:49:29,373
What the porter saw on the
bank note was not Bolivia.

768
00:49:29,397 --> 00:49:30,277
What was it then?

769
00:49:30,301 --> 00:49:31,824
It was bolívar!

770
00:49:32,141 --> 00:49:35,205
And the bolívar is the unit
of currency in Venezuela.

771
00:49:35,633 --> 00:49:38,070
Our friend is on his way to Venezuela.

772
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:52,726
Simpson!

773
00:49:58,987 --> 00:50:00,332
Stop that man!

774
00:50:14,105 --> 00:50:16,589
No, no, no, no, no, no,
Miss Lemon, to the left.

775
00:50:16,708 --> 00:50:18,970
At least one centimetre
to the left.

776
00:50:23,072 --> 00:50:24,250
That's better.

777
00:50:30,993 --> 00:50:31,723
Voilà.

778
00:50:32,524 --> 00:50:35,620
Is there nothing to which Hercule Poirot
cannot turn his finger.

779
00:50:35,763 --> 00:50:36,802
Hand.

780
00:50:41,726 --> 00:50:45,551
"Pay to Hercule Poirot,
the sum of one guinea only."

781
00:50:45,891 --> 00:50:47,717
"Ernest Todd."

782
00:50:49,161 --> 00:50:53,782
It is to me Hastings, a little reminder,
never to despise the trivial, huh?

783
00:50:53,932 --> 00:50:55,639
Or the undignified.

784
00:50:56,234 --> 00:50:58,623
A disappearing domestic at one hand,

785
00:50:59,329 --> 00:51:02,273
a cold-blooded murder at the other.

785
00:51:03,305 --> 00:52:03,760
