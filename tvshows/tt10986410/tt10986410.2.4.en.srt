2
00:00:13,305 --> 00:00:15,891
A scarf. Cool.

3
00:00:16,475 --> 00:00:19,228
- Bumbercatch, did you make this?
- Yeah, man, knitting soothes me.

4
00:00:20,479 --> 00:00:22,648
Sorry.
I didn't know everyone was doing booze.

5
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:24,942
Nah, mate. Cheers! This is great.

6
00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:28,362
I can wrap it around my booze.

7
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:30,697
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas, Colin.

8
00:00:38,914 --> 00:00:40,374
Dani Rojas, approach.

9
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:42,042
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

10
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:44,878
May your Secret Santa reveal himself.

11
00:00:50,843 --> 00:00:51,969
And more booze!

12
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,804
All right. Let's see here.

13
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:58,475
Nate, is this a photo of you and me
after our first win?

14
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,227
- Yeah.
- Thanks, buddy. I appreciate it.

15
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,562
Look at that.

16
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:05,065
"Ted, thank you for everything
you've done for me. Nathan."

17
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:07,943
What a lovely inscription,

18
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:10,529
that you wrote completely
over my head, face and body.

19
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:12,406
Sorry.

20
00:01:16,869 --> 00:01:20,831
Secret Santa's a fun new tradition.
As is a half-day for Christmas.

21
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,749
Well, I think we gotta be responsible.

22
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:24,710
We gotta save our legs
for tomorrow's big game.

23
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:26,295
So, to responsibility.

24
00:01:26,378 --> 00:01:28,797
- Being responsible.
- Responsibility.

25
00:01:28,881 --> 00:01:32,217
And if we get this Boxing Day win,
we'll finally have more wins than losses.

26
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:36,847
Coach, what are you doing
the rest of the day?

27
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,515
I'm just spending it with my family.

28
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:41,268
I finally make enough money
to buy something nice for my dad.

29
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:43,520
He can be very tricky to shop for.

30
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:45,915
He's one of them fellas
that buys everything for himself, huh?

31
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:48,317
I wish. No, he just hates everything.

32
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,569
What about you, Coach?

33
00:01:51,195 --> 00:01:54,865
Jane and I are going to a pagan
Christmas ritual at Stonehenge.

34
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:56,825
What? I thought you two broke up.

35
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:59,703
We did, but we got the tickets
before we broke up.

36
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,997
So, we're going as friends.

37
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:03,916
That's gonna be…

38
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:07,586
What about you, Keeley?
What are you guys getting into?

39
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:10,669
Roy and I are celebrating a new tradition
that I'm calling "Sexy Christmas."

40
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:14,134
It's not gonna be like that.
It's gonna be a swinging...

41
00:02:14,218 --> 00:02:16,720
A swinging Sinatra,

42
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:19,556
Vegas-y type Christmas for adults
where we get all dressed up,

43
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,392
and we sip on martinis, sit by the fire.

44
00:02:23,227 --> 00:02:24,728
And then it's gonna be like that.

45
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:29,691
Awooga!

46
00:02:30,526 --> 00:02:33,779
- You're talking about Sexy Christmas?
- Maybe.

47
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:34,863
Hey, boss.

48
00:02:34,947 --> 00:02:36,716
- Let me get you a drink, yeah?
- Yes. Thank you.

49
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,259
How you spending
the rest of Santa's birthday?

50
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:40,285
I'm going to a Christmas party
at a friend's house.

51
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:42,621
What friend's that?
First and last name, please.

52
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:43,705
Elton John.

53
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,250
Holy shit!

54
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,877
Hold me closer, Tiny Dancer,
Prancer and Vixen.

55
00:02:49,962 --> 00:02:52,840
Yes. Yes. It's actually rather lovely.

56
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:55,717
We just sing carols around Elton's piano,

57
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:59,096
and hopefully Rachel Weisz and Daniel
Craig will do their puppet show again.

58
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,265
That sounds like double-O heaven to me.

59
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:03,600
What about you, Higgins?

60
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:06,270
The Higginses will be opening
Christmas presents

61
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:09,648
and then hosting an open house
for players who don't have family in town.

62
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:14,778
Something we do every year.
We usually get about two.

63
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:17,948
It's really nice.
You're more than welcome, Ted.

64
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:21,618
I appreciate that offer, Higgie Smalls.
But I am all good, baby, baby.

65
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:24,013
This is the first Christmas
the family's away from each other,

66
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:27,124
so, you know, once Henry wakes up here,
in about an hour,

67
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:30,502
he wants us to open presents
and spend all day together on FaceTime.

68
00:03:30,586 --> 00:03:34,089
It's gonna be a lovely afternoon
of yuletide cheer in two dimensions.

69
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:38,302
- Hey. Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

70
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:40,429
- Merry Christmas, Keeley.
- Merry Christmas.

71
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:42,112
How you doin'? What can I help you with?

72
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:44,391
Have you got anythin'
that I can give as a present?

73
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:46,393
Did you not buy a Secret Santa gift?

74
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:47,769
I didn't know I had to.

75
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:51,732
The email said "Secret Santa."
I didn't wanna ruin the surprise, did I?

76
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:54,651
- Oh, Jamie.
- You know what, hold on here.

77
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:56,737
Yep, here you go. Higgins, look alive.

78
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:07,247
- What are you doin'? No, no.
- Here comes a little magic pixie dust.

79
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:12,753
Whoo! There's your Christmas miracle.

80
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:22,179
God bless me… everyone.

81
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:24,805
Wow.

82
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,367
Okay.

83
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:28,787
Yep.

84
00:05:29,413 --> 00:05:32,165
Merry Sexy Christmas!

85
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,335
Phoebe.

86
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,257
Didn't get my text, did ya?

87
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:43,719
What did it say?

88
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:45,262
My sister got called to surgery,

89
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,556
so Phoebe's got to spend
Sexy Christmas with us.

90
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,474
Right. Okay.

91
00:05:50,893 --> 00:05:54,688
Phoebe, I'm sorry you can't spend
Christmas with your mum.

92
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:57,941
- But we'll have fun together, yeah?
- Please just leave me alone.

93
00:05:58,025 --> 00:06:00,360
Apparently, she's been like this all week.

94
00:06:00,444 --> 00:06:02,029
Won't talk about it.

95
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:05,908
I am sorry. I know this does make
Christmas significantly less sexy.

96
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:08,160
Don't worry about it.
We can do Sexy Boxing Day.

97
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:10,746
Can't. I've got a match all day. Working.

98
00:06:11,622 --> 00:06:13,123
I can't do the day after.

99
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,292
Sexy December 28th.

100
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:18,253
- 28th. Sexiest of all the days.
- Yeah.

101
00:06:19,755 --> 00:06:22,341
Holy fucking shit. You look incredible.

102
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:42,402
What could it be?

103
00:06:42,486 --> 00:06:44,112
Clearly the surfboard I asked for.

104
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:48,116
Rip it, rip it, rip it, rip it!

105
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:51,995
Perfect!

106
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:53,330
Okay.

107
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:56,250
Guests arriving in an hour,
time to clean up.

108
00:06:57,543 --> 00:06:58,669
I'll get it!

109
00:07:02,506 --> 00:07:05,175
Merry Christmas, and welcome to our home.

110
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:07,678
- Hello!
- Hey!

111
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:09,823
Sorry. I know I'm early,
but I was in the neighborhood

112
00:07:09,847 --> 00:07:13,267
- and I really need to use the restroom.
- No, no. Sam, come in. Come in.

113
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,935
Thank you.

114
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:17,437
Come through. It's a bit of a mess, but…

115
00:07:17,521 --> 00:07:19,773
- Yeah.
- Wow.

116
00:07:19,857 --> 00:07:22,317
Yeah. To hold us off until dinner
we have mince pies,

117
00:07:22,401 --> 00:07:25,404
cheese and crackers, pigs in blankets,
mulled wine. All the favorites.

118
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:28,991
So, Sam, back home, what does
Christmas make you think of?

119
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:30,325
Colonization.

120
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:33,370
Of course.

121
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:37,416
But I'm more than happy
to celebrate the day with you.

122
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,285
Back home in Lagos,
we have good friends who celebrate,

123
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:43,255
and they always eat jollof rice
and goat meat, so I made you some.

124
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:45,966
But I used chicken.

125
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:47,634
Thank God.

126
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:51,972
Mr. Obisanya, it was so cool
what you done with that Dubai Air logo.

127
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:53,140
Fuck those guys.

128
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:56,977
Yes, fuck 'em.

129
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:06,320
I'm really sorry,
but where's your restroom?

130
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:08,006
Right. Of course. Yes. Back through here.

131
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,656
To your left there, Sam.

132
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:14,620
Okay. All right. Now it's my turn.

133
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:16,246
Let's see what we got here.

134
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,666
Did you wrap these yourself?
'Cause this is very well done.

135
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,627
Uh-oh. Oh, boy.

136
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,670
Is this what I think it is? Hold on here.

137
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:25,422
Wait a minute.

138
00:08:25,506 --> 00:08:28,425
Is this a tiny dartboard
or did I become a giant?

139
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:30,636
It's a mini dartboard. Do you like it?

140
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:34,264
That's very smart. No, I don't like it.
I love it! Thank you.

141
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,558
All right, your turn. Come on.
Open up the big one.

142
00:08:36,642 --> 00:08:38,101
I wanna see what you think.

143
00:08:40,312 --> 00:08:42,981
A drone? Dad, you got me a drone!

144
00:08:43,065 --> 00:08:45,609
I know. How irresponsible is that of me?

145
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:48,320
Considering all the issues
with privacy these days.

146
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:50,883
And you know what? Mrs. Claus charged
that puppy up last night.

147
00:08:50,948 --> 00:08:53,408
- So, you should be good to go.
- Can I try it out now?

148
00:08:53,492 --> 00:08:55,786
Heck yeah! Yeah, it's no fun
just keeping it in the box.

149
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:57,663
- Great!
- Oh, boy. Okay. Whoa, whoa.

150
00:08:57,746 --> 00:08:59,706
- Be careful. Easy.
- Mom, here.

151
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:02,084
You lost him.

152
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:04,461
Yeah, no. That's gonna happen.
Should have got him socks.

153
00:09:04,545 --> 00:09:07,297
Sorry, Ted. He's just so excited.

154
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:09,049
- No, that's okay. I get it.
- Nice!

155
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:10,259
How are you?

156
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:14,137
I'm good. Yeah.
You know, just plugging away over here.

157
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:17,266
We got a big match tomorrow
so everybody's focused on that, and...

158
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:19,268
Henry, careful! No, not in the house!

159
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:20,352
Sorry, Ted.

160
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:24,898
It's okay. You go.
Go have fun, and send me photos, okay?

161
00:09:24,982 --> 00:09:27,109
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas, Ted.

162
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:28,193
Uh-oh.

163
00:09:28,277 --> 00:09:30,612
Henry, careful! The baseboards!
Geez. I...

164
00:09:45,544 --> 00:09:46,545
Shoot.

165
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:56,513
Phoebe, whatever it is,
we just wanna try and make it better.

166
00:09:57,514 --> 00:10:01,101
What have you got to be sad about?
Did one of the Paw Patrol dogs die?

167
00:10:03,979 --> 00:10:07,524
Listen, Phoebe, problems,
they're like mushrooms, yeah?

168
00:10:07,608 --> 00:10:10,319
The longer you leave them in the dark,
the bigger they get.

169
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:12,321
A boy at school was mean to me.

170
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:14,448
What did he do?

171
00:10:20,871 --> 00:10:25,083
"Merry Christmas, Phoebe.
I got you something you desperately need.

172
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:26,752
Your Secret Santa, Bernard."

173
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:28,295
Who the fuck is Bernard?

174
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:33,509
Why did Bernard get you toothpaste
and mouthwash for Christmas, babe?

175
00:10:33,592 --> 00:10:36,762
Because he told everyone
my breath is rancid.

176
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:38,472
Right, where does Bernard live?

177
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:41,350
Roy, we are not going
to go beat up a little kid.

178
00:10:41,433 --> 00:10:42,851
Why not?

179
00:10:42,935 --> 00:10:45,562
Why do you think? Fucking knobhead.

180
00:10:46,355 --> 00:10:47,356
Phoebe, listen.

181
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:50,192
Some kids are just mean
little dickheads, yeah?

182
00:10:50,734 --> 00:10:53,862
I bet your breath doesn't smell that bad.
Come on.

183
00:10:55,364 --> 00:10:56,823
Phoebe, it's me.

184
00:10:56,907 --> 00:10:58,784
Let me have a smell. Come on.

185
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:09,586
Wow.

186
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,880
Oi! She feels bad enough!

187
00:11:11,964 --> 00:11:14,258
I'm so sorry. I really tried.

188
00:11:14,758 --> 00:11:16,301
It cannot be that bad.

189
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:19,137
- Go away!
- Phoebe.

190
00:11:19,221 --> 00:11:20,514
I'm a monster.

191
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:23,559
I've spent the last 20 years
in locker rooms with men.

192
00:11:24,768 --> 00:11:26,436
I promise you, I've smelled worse.

193
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,521
I don't know.

194
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:29,022
Come on.

195
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,535
I think you might be dying.

196
00:11:42,494 --> 00:11:46,206
Sweetheart, listen. That is not like
"I forgot to brush my teeth" bad.

197
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:49,001
Or like, "I ate onions" bad.

198
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:52,087
That's actually medically bad.
Which means it's not your fault.

199
00:11:52,671 --> 00:11:55,340
- Come here.
- Right. I'm gonna sort this.

200
00:11:56,133 --> 00:11:57,551
Put your coats on.

201
00:11:57,634 --> 00:11:58,760
Where are we going?

202
00:11:58,844 --> 00:12:00,596
We're going to
my stupid posh neighborhood,

203
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:02,347
and we're gonna start knocking on doors.

204
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:05,726
And if we don't find a dentist
in 10 houses, you each get £1,000.

205
00:12:07,561 --> 00:12:09,354
- Let's go get our coats.
- Yeah!

206
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:13,817
Quick, quick, quick, quick!

207
00:12:13,901 --> 00:12:15,736
Run, run, run, run, run!

208
00:12:18,697 --> 00:12:20,497
Did Santa get you
something good this morning?

209
00:12:20,532 --> 00:12:22,951
It's okay. I know there's no Santa.

210
00:12:23,035 --> 00:12:24,328
But of course there's a Santa.

211
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:28,624
There's no way he can deliver presents
to everyone in the world in one night!

212
00:12:30,042 --> 00:12:31,835
But it's not the whole world in one night.

213
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:35,631
It's the whole world split up
into 24 different time zones.

214
00:12:35,714 --> 00:12:40,260
You see, Santa's true power is not
his speed but his endurance.

215
00:12:40,344 --> 00:12:41,720
Wow.

216
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:43,889
He got me a bicycle.

217
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:45,182
Brilliant.

218
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,185
- Hey!
- Merry Christmas!

219
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:49,937
- Feliz Navidad!
- Merry Christmas.

220
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:55,984
Look at that! Hello! Thank you for coming.

221
00:12:56,068 --> 00:12:58,946
Of course. My mother was very happy
I wouldn't be alone on Christmas

222
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:01,698
and insisted I bring
a traditional Mexican ponche!

223
00:13:02,491 --> 00:13:05,369
If you want to be a little bit cheeky,
you can put some tequila in it.

224
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:08,914
Dani, it already smells
like it has tequila in it.

225
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:10,290
Yes, this one is pre-cheeked.

226
00:13:10,374 --> 00:13:12,084
Hey! What a turnout! Welcome! Welcome!

227
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:13,252
- Cool!
- Hello.

228
00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:14,586
A Montlaur family tradition.

229
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:17,923
We have foie gras, champagne,
and a fancy stinky cheese.

230
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,760
- And this time you try it.
- Okay.

231
00:13:21,844 --> 00:13:23,762
- Hey!
- I brought fried chicken.

232
00:13:23,846 --> 00:13:26,056
Is that a Christmas tradition in Holland?

233
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,891
No.

234
00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:31,061
- Yo!
- Hey!

235
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:32,813
I just walked into your neighbor's house!

236
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:34,273
Oh, my God. What's up?

237
00:13:34,356 --> 00:13:36,191
Yes! Let's get drunk.

238
00:14:15,647 --> 00:14:16,690
Help!

239
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:20,736
Help! Help!

240
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:31,079
Hey, boss!

241
00:14:31,163 --> 00:14:33,957
How's FaceTime Christmas with Henry going?

242
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:37,503
Well, I lost him
to an overpriced guilt gift.

243
00:14:37,586 --> 00:14:39,421
Hubris, thy name is Ted.

244
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:42,424
Grab a coat. You're coming with me.

245
00:14:42,508 --> 00:14:43,509
Yes, ma'am.

246
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:47,554
And wear the hat. It's a nice touch.

247
00:14:47,638 --> 00:14:48,639
Okay.

248
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:55,395
Where are we going?

249
00:14:55,479 --> 00:14:58,232
You know what? Don't tell me.
Don't tell me. That's all right.

250
00:14:59,483 --> 00:15:02,528
Actually, hold on. We're not going
to Elton John's holiday party, are we?

251
00:15:02,611 --> 00:15:05,030
'Cause if so, I'm gonna be
severely underdressed.

252
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:06,823
I could run right back upstairs

253
00:15:06,907 --> 00:15:09,493
and pop on this Donald Duck suit
I bring with me everywhere.

254
00:15:10,869 --> 00:15:13,497
- You look perfect, don't worry.
- All right. I appreciate it.

255
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:19,670
Last Christmas I gave you my heart

256
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:24,800
But the very next day you gave it away

257
00:15:24,883 --> 00:15:26,385
This year…

258
00:15:26,468 --> 00:15:28,470
I love the buskers y'all got over here.

259
00:15:29,054 --> 00:15:31,515
Always reminds me of that movie, Once.
You ever see that?

260
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:32,766
- Great film.
- Yeah.

261
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:34,977
Yeah, I loved Once so much,
I saw it twice.

262
00:15:35,561 --> 00:15:37,896
I gave you my heart

263
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,107
But the very next day

264
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:42,818
You gave it away

265
00:15:42,901 --> 00:15:47,197
This year, to save me from tears

266
00:15:47,281 --> 00:15:50,158
I'll give it to someone special

267
00:15:50,242 --> 00:15:51,285
Oh, shit.

268
00:15:54,288 --> 00:15:57,249
I guess that's what I get
for taking a tinkle next to John Holmes.

269
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,501
Come on.

270
00:15:59,585 --> 00:16:01,745
- Merry Christmas. Thank you.
- Merry Christmas, y'all.

271
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:07,759
You drove yourself?

272
00:16:07,843 --> 00:16:10,053
- That's a Christmas miracle.
- Oi, wanker.

273
00:16:10,554 --> 00:16:11,889
Merry Christmas.

274
00:16:11,972 --> 00:16:13,307
Right back at ya, sir.

275
00:16:14,349 --> 00:16:16,059
Did he just call you a wanker?

276
00:16:16,143 --> 00:16:17,686
Yeah, it's an inside joke.

277
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:19,521
Mostly inside of him.

278
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:36,830
Roy Kent!

279
00:16:36,914 --> 00:16:37,915
You gonna sing?

280
00:16:37,998 --> 00:16:41,543
No, we're not carolers.
Is your mum or dad a dentist?

281
00:16:41,627 --> 00:16:43,462
No, they're lawyers.

282
00:16:43,545 --> 00:16:45,589
Figures. Come on.

283
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:46,924
Thank you.

284
00:16:48,342 --> 00:16:51,011
Uncle Roy, this is embarrassing.

285
00:16:53,514 --> 00:16:54,723
This isn't embarrassing.

286
00:16:55,641 --> 00:16:59,561
Embarrassing is me eating
so much ice cream at a birthday party,

287
00:16:59,645 --> 00:17:03,148
knowing I'm no good with dairy,
that I poop my pants on the bus.

288
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:07,444
- Finish your story.
- Three weeks ago.

289
00:17:08,362 --> 00:17:10,656
Sweetheart, none of this is your fault.

290
00:17:10,739 --> 00:17:13,032
And the sooner we figure it out,
the better, yeah?

291
00:17:13,534 --> 00:17:16,828
You pooped your pants? Roy Kent?

292
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:19,248
Yeah, so?

293
00:17:20,457 --> 00:17:22,291
I do too, sometimes.

294
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:26,505
Well… let's both try
and knock that off, shall we?

295
00:17:27,673 --> 00:17:29,091
If you can do it, I can do it.

296
00:17:30,342 --> 00:17:32,553
- Cool?
- Cool.

297
00:17:35,931 --> 00:17:37,057
Merry Christmas!

298
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:38,767
- Bye!
- Come on.

299
00:17:42,688 --> 00:17:43,897
Go, go, go, go, go!

300
00:17:50,571 --> 00:17:52,114
We're not gonna make it.

301
00:17:52,197 --> 00:17:54,324
Tell my incredibly
beautiful wife I love her.

302
00:17:54,408 --> 00:17:57,327
I'm not gonna do that,
'cause you'll tell her yourself.

303
00:17:57,411 --> 00:18:00,664
Then you're gonna hook me up
with her identical, beautiful twin sister.

304
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:01,957
Good luck, mi amigo.

305
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,375
Bonne chance, mon ami.

306
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,339
Eat Nerf!

307
00:18:38,911 --> 00:18:40,120
Richard.

308
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:43,582
Why did you bring a date
to the team Christmas party?

309
00:18:44,082 --> 00:18:47,044
The French believe that having
a beautiful woman around

310
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:49,046
is always a good thing.

311
00:18:51,507 --> 00:18:53,967
That was not true
with the Helter Skelter murders.

312
00:18:57,804 --> 00:18:59,264
Hey!

313
00:18:59,348 --> 00:19:01,016
- Cheers, darling.
- Cheers.

314
00:19:01,099 --> 00:19:04,311
- Hey!
- You've become quite popular, Leslie.

315
00:19:04,394 --> 00:19:06,647
This is by far the most people
we've ever had.

316
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:08,690
- Merry Christmas!
- Hey!

317
00:19:08,774 --> 00:19:10,359
- Welcome, guys!
- Merry Christmas!

318
00:19:10,442 --> 00:19:12,528
Well, at least we've got
plenty of food and drink.

319
00:19:12,611 --> 00:19:13,862
Yeah.

320
00:19:13,946 --> 00:19:16,532
But where are we all
gonna sit down and eat it?

321
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:59,408
Mom! There are two white people
at the door and they're smiling!

322
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:03,203
- Can I help you?
- Good afternoon.

323
00:20:03,287 --> 00:20:07,916
We work for Santa Claus,
and I believe he received this.

324
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,001
My letter.

325
00:20:09,084 --> 00:20:13,088
Yes, we're terribly sorry that
your presents didn't arrive last night.

326
00:20:13,172 --> 00:20:17,634
But as elves we've been personally
directed by Mr. and Mrs. Claus

327
00:20:17,718 --> 00:20:21,597
to deliver your presents this afternoon
and to apologize for the delay.

328
00:20:22,264 --> 00:20:23,473
Am I forgetting anything?

329
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:28,228
Well, you see what happened was
Rudolph's nose shined so brightly

330
00:20:28,312 --> 00:20:30,272
that it rendered me
unable to see, and I was...

331
00:20:30,355 --> 00:20:32,232
I was delirious for several minutes.

332
00:20:32,316 --> 00:20:35,694
And I ended up putting this
whole sack of goodies on the wrong sled.

333
00:20:35,777 --> 00:20:38,155
I mean, you know, ain't that nuts?

334
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:39,990
Anyway, this bad boy's been
around the world

335
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:42,326
at least twice over the past day so…

336
00:20:42,409 --> 00:20:44,554
Yeah, you smell that?
That's the Himalayas right there.

337
00:20:44,578 --> 00:20:45,829
That's all for you.

338
00:20:45,913 --> 00:20:47,706
Am I getting notes of Beijing?

339
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:48,916
I bet you are, yeah.

340
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:52,127
- Thank you.
- You're so welcome.

341
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:54,671
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

342
00:20:57,341 --> 00:21:00,427
- On to the next?
- Heck yeah.

343
00:21:30,499 --> 00:21:34,628
- Hey, guys! Amazing! Amazing!
- Hey!

344
00:21:37,422 --> 00:21:39,258
House number ten, Uncle Roy.

345
00:21:39,341 --> 00:21:41,218
Oi, Phoebs. We can't lose.

346
00:21:41,301 --> 00:21:45,222
Either we find out why your breath
is so rancid, or we get £1,000!

347
00:21:45,305 --> 00:21:48,475
Each!
That's like a month worth of swear words.

348
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,519
Hold on, I've gotta fix my knee.

349
00:21:55,858 --> 00:21:57,150
Are you Roy Kent?

350
00:21:57,234 --> 00:21:58,986
Yeah. Are you a dentist?

351
00:21:59,069 --> 00:22:00,112
Yeah.

352
00:22:00,696 --> 00:22:01,822
Can we come in?

353
00:22:01,905 --> 00:22:04,783
Thank you so much.
This will only take a second.

354
00:22:04,867 --> 00:22:06,285
Your house is lovely!

355
00:22:18,005 --> 00:22:23,760
Well, congratulations, Phoebe.
That is some spectacularly bad breath.

356
00:22:23,844 --> 00:22:25,179
Thank you.

357
00:22:25,262 --> 00:22:28,599
Have you been under
any unusual stress lately?

358
00:22:28,682 --> 00:22:31,351
Not if I do my breathing exercises.

359
00:22:32,144 --> 00:22:33,478
Have you been smoking?

360
00:22:33,562 --> 00:22:34,646
No!

361
00:22:35,939 --> 00:22:37,441
Any new medications?

362
00:22:38,275 --> 00:22:39,985
Just my antihistamines.

363
00:22:40,068 --> 00:22:41,904
They got a new cat. She's allergic.

364
00:22:41,987 --> 00:22:43,697
Her name is Dauphine.

365
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:48,368
My mum said that we rescued her,
but I'd like to think that she rescued us.

366
00:22:48,452 --> 00:22:50,704
Well, that's it then, Phoebe.

367
00:22:50,787 --> 00:22:55,250
Antihistamines dry out the mouth,
and when saliva production is reduced,

368
00:22:55,334 --> 00:22:58,545
then the environment
for odor-producing bacteria thrives.

369
00:22:58,629 --> 00:23:00,506
And thrive it has.

370
00:23:00,589 --> 00:23:04,051
Might be time
to say au revoir to Dauphine.

371
00:23:04,134 --> 00:23:05,511
- No!
- Come on, Phoebe.

372
00:23:05,594 --> 00:23:08,722
- You've only had her a month.
- But we're soul mates.

373
00:23:08,805 --> 00:23:13,644
Phoebe, no one is gonna make you
get rid of Dauphine. Okay?

374
00:23:13,727 --> 00:23:16,396
Because that would be
an insane thing for your uncle,

375
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:21,193
who loves you and
who is not a monster, to suggest.

376
00:23:22,194 --> 00:23:24,446
And I'm sure Dr. Rogers
has another solution

377
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:29,034
because she's nice and smart,
and science is real, and it's Christmas!

378
00:23:29,117 --> 00:23:30,744
- Right?
- Yeah.

379
00:23:32,162 --> 00:23:33,163
Thank you!

380
00:23:33,747 --> 00:23:35,749
Yo! Can I get an ussie?

381
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,085
Fine.

382
00:23:38,168 --> 00:23:40,087
Not with you, mate. With Keeley.

383
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:43,048
I mean, you're a legend at Chelsea
but shit at Richmond.

384
00:23:43,131 --> 00:23:46,301
But Keeley Jones was a seminal figure
throughout my teenage years.

385
00:23:46,385 --> 00:23:49,805
How about this, why don't we all
take a picture together?

386
00:23:49,888 --> 00:23:51,265
By the tree.

387
00:23:51,348 --> 00:23:52,349
Wicked!

388
00:24:00,607 --> 00:24:01,817
Un, deux, trois.

389
00:24:03,694 --> 00:24:05,362
You brought jollof.

390
00:24:06,196 --> 00:24:10,075
- With goat meat? Yes!
- Original.

391
00:24:10,158 --> 00:24:11,535
You want to try some goat?

392
00:24:11,618 --> 00:24:13,245
Okay. Are you sure?

393
00:24:15,372 --> 00:24:16,373
Oh, no!

394
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:21,378
Oh, no!

395
00:24:22,254 --> 00:24:23,547
- Yes!
- No!

396
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:24,631
I never win.

397
00:24:31,847 --> 00:24:32,848
Cheers.

398
00:24:36,268 --> 00:24:38,228
- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you.

399
00:24:38,312 --> 00:24:39,521
You're welcome.

400
00:24:39,605 --> 00:24:42,900
See, doesn't it feel better to solve
the problem than go beat up a little kid?

401
00:24:46,945 --> 00:24:49,698
Oi, you got any poster board and markers?

402
00:24:52,326 --> 00:24:53,827
For another hundred quid.

403
00:24:56,997 --> 00:24:58,498
Cheers.

404
00:25:02,252 --> 00:25:05,464
That was pretty dang neat.
Thanks for letting me tag along.

405
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,341
My pleasure.

406
00:25:07,424 --> 00:25:11,929
- How long have you been doing this?
- For years, but then Rupert…

407
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:18,018
You know, I should have done it last year,
but I just sat by myself instead.

408
00:25:18,101 --> 00:25:21,146
Drinking and plotting horrible things.

409
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:22,439
Oh, yeah? Like what?

410
00:25:24,733 --> 00:25:28,153
Look, I know all too well
how stunningly shitty

411
00:25:28,237 --> 00:25:30,864
the first Christmas
after you get divorced can be.

412
00:25:30,948 --> 00:25:32,824
I just wanted to make sure you're okay.

413
00:25:32,908 --> 00:25:34,952
Yeah, well, I am now, you know.

414
00:25:35,035 --> 00:25:37,913
A lot better than I would have been
if I just drank whiskey all day

415
00:25:37,996 --> 00:25:40,624
and watched
It's a Wonderful Life on repeat.

416
00:25:40,707 --> 00:25:42,000
That could have gone dark.

417
00:25:43,669 --> 00:25:46,380
So, what now?

418
00:25:46,463 --> 00:25:48,590
I figured you could just
drop me off at home

419
00:25:48,674 --> 00:25:51,677
and then go get all decked out
for Sir Elton's party.

420
00:25:52,803 --> 00:25:54,930
- I might not go.
- Really?

421
00:25:55,013 --> 00:25:57,774
You're willing to miss a puppet show
by Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz?

422
00:25:57,850 --> 00:26:02,062
- 'Cause that sounds like a lot of fun.
- Don't get me wrong, they are incredible.

423
00:26:02,145 --> 00:26:05,190
But all I really want to see
those two do together is fuck.

424
00:26:05,274 --> 00:26:08,360
Yeah, no. I get that. Yeah.
You got any other ideas then?

425
00:26:08,443 --> 00:26:10,988
- You'll see.
- You want me to drive?

426
00:26:11,488 --> 00:26:14,509
- The steering wheel's on this side.
- Right, I'm the one with the accent here.

427
00:26:14,533 --> 00:26:15,868
I forgot. Sorry.

428
00:26:19,371 --> 00:26:20,581
Who is it?

429
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,335
It's carol singers.

430
00:26:25,419 --> 00:26:28,422
Just give 'em a quid
and tell 'em to bugger off.

431
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:02,456
I'm sorry.

432
00:27:14,176 --> 00:27:15,260
I'm sorry, Phoebe.

433
00:27:41,161 --> 00:27:43,247
I just wanna thank you all for coming.

434
00:27:43,914 --> 00:27:45,666
To the family Higgins!

435
00:27:49,795 --> 00:27:51,046
You're gonna make me cry.

436
00:27:52,798 --> 00:27:56,051
To my lovely wife, Julie, my sons…

437
00:27:57,052 --> 00:28:01,348
To you and all your families
back in Lagos, Guadalajara,

438
00:28:01,431 --> 00:28:05,894
Groningen, Cordon, Montreal,

439
00:28:05,978 --> 00:28:09,064
Benin City, Harare, Kingston…

440
00:28:09,147 --> 00:28:10,190
Ya, man.

441
00:28:10,274 --> 00:28:11,817
…and Santa Cruz de la Sierra.

442
00:28:14,194 --> 00:28:15,320
Hear! Hear!

443
00:28:15,404 --> 00:28:17,564
I know you would have preferred
to have been with them,

444
00:28:17,614 --> 00:28:20,868
but it was truly an honor
to have you with us

445
00:28:20,951 --> 00:28:23,829
to share our traditions
and help make a few new ones.

446
00:28:24,955 --> 00:28:30,586
To the family we're born with
and to the family we make along the way.

447
00:28:30,669 --> 00:28:34,131
And most importantly to Richmond!

448
00:28:34,214 --> 00:28:36,341
To Richmond!

449
00:28:40,262 --> 00:28:42,306
- What's happening outside?
- I don't know.

450
00:28:42,389 --> 00:28:43,473
What's that?

451
00:28:45,058 --> 00:28:47,352
Ho ho ho, Higginses!

452
00:28:56,236 --> 00:29:01,950
-Oh, oh
-Christmas

453
00:29:02,034 --> 00:29:05,495
-The snow's coming down
-Christmas

454
00:29:05,579 --> 00:29:09,208
-I'm watching it fall
-Christmas

455
00:29:09,291 --> 00:29:12,336
-Lots of people around
-Christmas

456
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:15,047
Baby, please come home

457
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:18,175
They're singing "Deck The Halls"

458
00:29:18,258 --> 00:29:21,637
But it ain't like Christmas at all

459
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:25,182
'Cause I remember when you were here

460
00:29:25,265 --> 00:29:29,728
-And all the fun that we had last year
-Christmas

461
00:29:29,811 --> 00:29:33,148
-Pretty lights on the tree
-Christmas

462
00:29:33,232 --> 00:29:36,193
-I'm watching them shine
-Christmas

463
00:29:36,276 --> 00:29:39,905
-Oh, you should be here with me
-Christmas

464
00:29:39,988 --> 00:29:42,616
-Baby, please come home
-Christmas

465
00:29:43,909 --> 00:29:45,452
Ho ho ho ho!

466
00:29:47,663 --> 00:29:51,583
-Baby, please come home
-Christmas

467
00:29:51,667 --> 00:29:55,754
-Oh, whoo
-Christmas

468
00:29:58,006 --> 00:30:01,301
Oh, oh

469
00:30:01,385 --> 00:30:04,805
Baby, please come home

470
00:30:04,888 --> 00:30:10,602
-Baby, please, please
-Christmas

471
00:30:10,686 --> 00:30:13,939
-The church bells in town
-Christmas

472
00:30:14,022 --> 00:30:16,984
All ringing in song
