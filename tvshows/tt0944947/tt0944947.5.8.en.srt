2
00:02:04,145 --> 00:02:06,329
Your Grace,
I want to say--

3
00:02:06,449 --> 00:02:08,029
You will not speak.

4
00:02:10,485 --> 00:02:12,486
How do I know you are
who you say you are?

5
00:02:12,537 --> 00:02:15,016
If only I were otherwise.

6
00:02:15,127 --> 00:02:17,896
If you are Tyrion Lannister,
why shouldn't I kill you

7
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:20,231
to pay your family back
for what it did to mine?

8
00:02:20,266 --> 00:02:22,934
You want revenge
against the Lannisters?

9
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:25,353
I killed my mother
Joanna Lannister

10
00:02:25,355 --> 00:02:27,188
on the day I was born.

11
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:30,775
I killed my father Tywin Lannister
with a bolt to the heart.

12
00:02:30,826 --> 00:02:33,444
I am the greatest Lannister
killer of our time.

13
00:02:33,495 --> 00:02:35,630
So I should welcome you
into my service

14
00:02:35,664 --> 00:02:37,899
because you murdered members
of your own family?

15
00:02:39,134 --> 00:02:41,653
Into your service?

16
00:02:41,687 --> 00:02:44,639
Your Grace, we have
only just met.

17
00:02:44,673 --> 00:02:46,991
It's too soon to know
if you deserve my service.

18
00:02:47,059 --> 00:02:49,877
If you'd rather return
to the fighting pits,

19
00:02:49,912 --> 00:02:52,130
just say the word.

20
00:02:54,266 --> 00:02:56,801
When I was a young man,
I heard a story

21
00:02:56,852 --> 00:03:00,305
about a baby born during the
worst storm in living memory.

22
00:03:00,356 --> 00:03:02,357
She had no wealth,
no lands, no army,

23
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:05,777
<i>only a name and a
handful of supporters,</i>

24
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:09,314
most of whom probably thought they could
use that name to benefit themselves.

25
00:03:09,365 --> 00:03:11,899
They kept her alive, moving
her from place to place,

26
00:03:11,951 --> 00:03:15,136
<i>often hours ahead of the men</i>
<i>who'd been sent to kill her.</i>

27
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:18,456
<i>She was eventually sold off to some
warlord on the edge of the world</i>

28
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,742
<i>and that appeared to be that.</i>

29
00:03:20,744 --> 00:03:22,744
<i>And then a few years later,</i>

30
00:03:22,795 --> 00:03:25,079
the most well-informed
person I knew

31
00:03:25,164 --> 00:03:27,999
told me that this girl without
wealth, lands, or armies

32
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:31,252
had somehow acquired all three
in a very short span of time,

33
00:03:31,254 --> 00:03:33,254
along with three dragons.

34
00:03:33,305 --> 00:03:35,340
<i>He thought she was our best,</i>

35
00:03:35,391 --> 00:03:38,259
<i>last chance to build</i>
<i>a better world.</i>

36
00:03:39,728 --> 00:03:42,430
I thought you were worth
meeting at the very least.

37
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:43,931
And why are you worth meeting?

38
00:03:43,933 --> 00:03:45,767
Why should I spend
my time listening to you?

39
00:03:45,769 --> 00:03:48,886
Because you cannot build
a better world on your own.

40
00:03:48,921 --> 00:03:52,340
You have no one at your side who
understands the land you want to rule.

41
00:03:52,374 --> 00:03:54,359
The strengths and
weaknesses of the houses

42
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:55,693
<i>that will either</i>
<i>join or oppose you.</i>

43
00:03:55,744 --> 00:03:58,746
I will have a very large army

44
00:03:58,781 --> 00:04:00,331
and very large dragons.

45
00:04:00,366 --> 00:04:03,951
Killing and politics
aren't always the same thing.

46
00:04:03,953 --> 00:04:05,920
When I served
as Hand of the King,

47
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:08,589
I did quite well with the latter
considering the king in question

48
00:04:08,624 --> 00:04:10,925
preferred torturing animals
to leading his people.

49
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:14,012
I could do an even better job

50
00:04:14,046 --> 00:04:16,331
advising a ruler worth the name.

51
00:04:16,365 --> 00:04:18,733
<i>If that is indeed what you are.</i>

52
00:04:18,767 --> 00:04:21,019
So you want to advise me?

53
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:25,273
Very well.

54
00:04:26,642 --> 00:04:28,192
What would you
have me do with him?

55
00:04:29,945 --> 00:04:33,648
<i>I swore I would kill him</i>
<i>if he ever returned.</i>

56
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:35,566
I know.

57
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:42,957
Why should the people trust a queen
who can't keep her promises?

58
00:04:46,028 --> 00:04:48,746
Whomever Ser Jorah was when
he started informing on you,

59
00:04:48,797 --> 00:04:51,833
he is no longer that man.

60
00:04:51,884 --> 00:04:53,918
I can't remember
ever seeing a sane man

61
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:56,337
as devoted to anything
as he is to serving you.

62
00:04:56,339 --> 00:04:59,424
<i>He claims he would kill</i>
<i>for you and die for you</i>

63
00:04:59,475 --> 00:05:02,176
<i>and nothing I ever witnessed</i>
<i>gives me reason to doubt him.</i>

64
00:05:06,115 --> 00:05:08,249
And yet he did betray you.

65
00:05:20,696 --> 00:05:23,364
Did he have an opportunity
to confess his betrayal?

66
00:05:23,366 --> 00:05:25,616
Yes.

67
00:05:25,651 --> 00:05:27,702
Many opportunities.

68
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:30,371
<i>And did he?</i>

69
00:05:30,406 --> 00:05:34,759
No, not until forced to do so.

70
00:05:39,481 --> 00:05:41,382
He worships you.

71
00:05:41,433 --> 00:05:44,218
He is in love with you, I think.

72
00:05:44,269 --> 00:05:46,554
<i>But he did not trust you</i>
<i>with the truth.</i>

73
00:05:46,605 --> 00:05:48,106
<i>An unpleasant truth to be sure,</i>

74
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:50,625
<i>but one of great</i>
<i>significance to you.</i>

75
00:05:50,659 --> 00:05:53,795
<i>He did not trust that you would
be wise enough to forgive him.</i>

76
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:56,831
So I should kill him?

77
00:05:58,117 --> 00:06:00,201
A ruler who kills
those devoted to her

78
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:02,904
is not a ruler
who inspires devotion.

79
00:06:02,955 --> 00:06:05,123
And you're going to need
to inspire devotion,

80
00:06:05,157 --> 00:06:08,993
a lot of it, if you're ever going
to rule across the Narrow Sea.

81
00:06:10,629 --> 00:06:13,915
But you cannot have him
by your side when you do.

82
00:06:19,288 --> 00:06:21,589
Remove Ser Jorah from the city.

83
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:34,378
Confess.

84
00:07:34,413 --> 00:07:36,664
My son.

85
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,735
Let me speak to--

86
00:07:40,769 --> 00:07:42,003
Confess.

87
00:07:42,054 --> 00:07:43,971
I meant it.

88
00:07:44,006 --> 00:07:47,758
My face will be the
last thing you see--

89
00:08:04,076 --> 00:08:07,795
My name is Lanna.
I'm an orphan.

90
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:11,332
<i>When I was eight,</i>
<i>I begged enough money</i>

91
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:13,367
<i>to buy my first</i>
<i>bucket of oysters.</i>

92
00:08:13,369 --> 00:08:17,705
I sold that bucket and made
enough money to buy two more.

93
00:08:19,675 --> 00:08:23,177
<i>It took a while, but
I finally saved enough</i>

94
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:25,296
<i>to buy myself an oyster cart.</i>

95
00:08:25,347 --> 00:08:27,131
<i>Now every morning,</i>

96
00:08:27,182 --> 00:08:29,267
<i>I make my way</i>
<i>down to the canals.</i>

97
00:08:31,303 --> 00:08:34,555
<i>I pass the fish mongers</i>
<i>and the bakers.</i>

98
00:08:39,611 --> 00:08:41,279
<i>I usually see Lhara,</i>

99
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:44,365
<i>my first customer of the day</i>
<i>on her way home.</i>

100
00:08:45,784 --> 00:08:49,153
<i>Then I turn left</i>
<i>onto Moonsinger Lane--</i>

101
00:08:51,623 --> 00:08:54,742
Turn left onto Ragman Lane

102
00:08:54,793 --> 00:08:56,294
where I do most of my trade.

103
00:08:56,328 --> 00:08:58,579
Lanna is very impressive.

104
00:08:58,581 --> 00:09:01,248
Very industrious.

105
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:04,001
She will make a fine servant
for the Many-Faced God.

106
00:09:04,052 --> 00:09:06,053
How will she serve him?

107
00:09:06,088 --> 00:09:09,507
She will no longer
turn left onto Ragman Lane.

108
00:09:09,558 --> 00:09:11,926
She will turn right
and go to Ragman Harbor.

109
00:09:11,977 --> 00:09:13,561
What will she do there?

110
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:15,596
She will see.

111
00:09:15,647 --> 00:09:18,566
<i>See what?</i>

112
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,102
<i>How can a man tell a girl this?</i>

113
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:22,436
<i>If he knew what she would see,</i>

114
00:09:22,438 --> 00:09:24,939
<i>there would be</i>
<i>no reason to send her.</i>

115
00:09:24,941 --> 00:09:27,608
Oysters, clams, and cockles!

116
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:47,878
Oysters, clams, and cockles!

117
00:09:55,937 --> 00:09:59,306
Oysters, clams, and cockles!

118
00:09:59,308 --> 00:10:02,393
Your oysters fresh?

119
00:10:02,444 --> 00:10:04,061
Best in the city.

120
00:10:04,112 --> 00:10:06,197
You wouldn't lie
to an old man, would you?

121
00:10:19,127 --> 00:10:21,162
Mm.

122
00:10:21,164 --> 00:10:24,999
Very nice. Give me
four with vinegar.

123
00:10:28,587 --> 00:10:30,304
It's my 18th voyage.

124
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:32,890
Returned from all of them
without a scratch on me.

125
00:10:39,564 --> 00:10:41,015
Can't do it.

126
00:10:41,017 --> 00:10:44,018
<i>Please, I've three children.</i>

127
00:10:44,069 --> 00:10:45,770
<i>Without me...</i>

128
00:10:45,821 --> 00:10:47,321
Here, take it.
You have to.

129
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:49,106
I've three children.

130
00:10:49,157 --> 00:10:50,357
- What will they do?
- Come on.

131
00:10:50,409 --> 00:10:52,159
They've nothing without me.

132
00:10:52,194 --> 00:10:53,694
<i>Please, you have to!</i>

133
00:10:53,745 --> 00:10:56,197
Please, you don't understand!

134
00:10:56,199 --> 00:10:57,865
<i>Please!</i>

135
00:11:03,922 --> 00:11:05,873
<i>The man is a gambler.</i>

136
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,043
He wages that a sailor's ship

137
00:11:09,045 --> 00:11:12,296
will make it to its destination.

138
00:11:12,347 --> 00:11:14,715
It is a strange wager
for the captain.

139
00:11:14,766 --> 00:11:17,384
He only wins
if he loses his life.

140
00:11:19,521 --> 00:11:22,556
So why would a captain make
the wager in the first place?

141
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:27,044
A girl tells a man
that she has seen.

142
00:11:29,648 --> 00:11:31,782
If the captain dies,

143
00:11:31,817 --> 00:11:34,101
the thin man pays
his family a lot of money.

144
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:39,457
But perhaps the gambler
loses his bet

145
00:11:39,491 --> 00:11:41,742
and decides he does not
have to pay after all.

146
00:11:41,744 --> 00:11:44,078
A destitute woman
and her small child,

147
00:11:44,129 --> 00:11:47,915
what can they do to such a man if
he keeps their money for himself?

148
00:11:49,985 --> 00:11:52,586
To whom can they turn
for recourse?

149
00:11:58,593 --> 00:12:00,177
The Many-Faced God.

150
00:12:02,097 --> 00:12:04,598
You said you didn't know
what I would see at the docks.

151
00:12:04,733 --> 00:12:07,701
A man had no idea what a girl
would see and what she would not.

152
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:12,523
A girl named Lanna
will return to the docks.

153
00:12:12,557 --> 00:12:14,308
She will watch the gambler.

154
00:12:14,342 --> 00:12:17,428
<i>She will come to know as much about
him as she knows about herself.</i>

155
00:12:17,462 --> 00:12:19,997
And then what?

156
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:23,784
A gift for the thin man.

157
00:12:43,638 --> 00:12:45,806
She's not ready.

158
00:12:45,857 --> 00:12:48,943
Perhaps she is,
perhaps she's not.

159
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:51,278
And if she's not?

160
00:12:51,313 --> 00:12:54,198
It is all the same
to the Many-Faced God.

161
00:13:17,222 --> 00:13:19,607
The trial will take place soon.

162
00:13:19,641 --> 00:13:21,642
<i>The High Sparrow</i>
<i>will be presenting</i>

163
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:23,477
<i>a substantial case against you.</i>

164
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:24,745
The charges?

165
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:27,147
<i>Fornication, treason, incest,</i>

166
00:13:27,215 --> 00:13:28,582
the murder of King Robert.

167
00:13:28,617 --> 00:13:29,917
All lies.

168
00:13:29,951 --> 00:13:31,685
Of course, Your Grace.

169
00:13:36,241 --> 00:13:40,110
My concern is that
the Faith does not adhere

170
00:13:40,161 --> 00:13:43,597
to the same standards
of proof as the crown.

171
00:13:43,632 --> 00:13:45,466
<i>I hope you'll excuse me</i>
<i>for saying it,</i>

172
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,135
<i>but belief is so often</i>
<i>the death of reason.</i>

173
00:13:48,169 --> 00:13:50,104
I wish you had said it sooner.

174
00:13:52,774 --> 00:13:54,241
Is there any word from Jaime?

175
00:13:54,276 --> 00:13:56,794
No, I'm afraid not.

176
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:07,271
Your Grace,
Grand Maester Pycelle

177
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:09,473
has summoned your Uncle Kevan

178
00:14:09,524 --> 00:14:11,058
back from Casterly Rock

179
00:14:11,092 --> 00:14:12,559
to serve as Hand of the King.

180
00:14:12,594 --> 00:14:15,246
He now presides
over the small council.

181
00:14:16,615 --> 00:14:18,899
Tell him I need to speak to him.

182
00:14:18,901 --> 00:14:21,368
I implored him to visit
you, but he would not.

183
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,909
What about my son, the king?

184
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,744
If you can visit me,
then surely the king...

185
00:14:30,795 --> 00:14:33,330
Your arrest and Queen
Margaery's arrest,

186
00:14:33,381 --> 00:14:34,748
the king has not
taken them well.

187
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:36,667
<i>He remains in his chambers.</i>

188
00:14:36,718 --> 00:14:40,638
His servants often find his food
in the hall left untouched.

189
00:14:40,722 --> 00:14:42,172
You need to talk to him.

190
00:14:42,223 --> 00:14:44,504
You need to talk to my son and
tell him to come and see me,

191
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:45,893
come and see his mother.

192
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:48,595
He-- I tried,
Your Grace.

193
00:14:48,647 --> 00:14:50,931
He wouldn't see me.
He won't see anyone.

194
00:14:52,267 --> 00:14:54,018
I can't stay here.

195
00:14:55,236 --> 00:14:58,355
There is a way, Your Grace.

196
00:15:02,327 --> 00:15:03,694
A way out.

197
00:15:06,281 --> 00:15:08,115
Confess?

198
00:15:09,284 --> 00:15:10,784
To the High Sparrow?

199
00:15:10,786 --> 00:15:12,953
I won't.

200
00:15:12,955 --> 00:15:15,839
I made him.

201
00:15:15,874 --> 00:15:17,791
I rose him up from nothing.

202
00:15:17,842 --> 00:15:20,627
I will not kneel before
some barefooted commoner

203
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:23,130
and beg his forgiveness.

204
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:32,723
Good-bye, my queen.

205
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:36,176
The work continues.

206
00:16:11,396 --> 00:16:13,430
Why?

207
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,567
Why, Theon?

208
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:19,737
I'm not Theon.
There is no Theon.

209
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:21,271
- Reek.
- Reek.

210
00:16:21,322 --> 00:16:23,741
Why did you tell him, Reek?

211
00:16:24,826 --> 00:16:27,027
I was helping you.

212
00:16:27,078 --> 00:16:28,612
You wanted to escape.

213
00:16:28,663 --> 00:16:31,565
There is no escape.

214
00:16:31,599 --> 00:16:34,118
Not ever.

215
00:16:34,169 --> 00:16:37,504
Theon Greyjoy tried to escape.

216
00:16:37,539 --> 00:16:39,373
The master knew.

217
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:43,010
He knows everything.

218
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:45,379
He hunted him and caught him

219
00:16:45,381 --> 00:16:47,714
and strapped him to a cross

220
00:16:47,716 --> 00:16:50,134
and cut away piece after piece

221
00:16:50,185 --> 00:16:52,553
until there was no Theon left.

222
00:16:56,307 --> 00:16:58,308
Good.

223
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:05,399
If it weren't for you,
I'd still have a family.

224
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:07,901
If I could do
what Ramsay did to you

225
00:17:07,903 --> 00:17:10,788
right here, right now, I would.

226
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,910
I deserved everything.

227
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:21,248
I deserve to be Reek.

228
00:17:22,634 --> 00:17:24,751
<i>I did terrible things.</i>

229
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:29,256
Turned on Robb.

230
00:17:29,258 --> 00:17:31,758
Captured Winterfell.

231
00:17:31,843 --> 00:17:34,344
- Killed those boys.
- They weren't "those boys."

232
00:17:34,395 --> 00:17:36,730
They were Bran and Rickon.
They were your brothers.

233
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:38,348
You've known them
since they were born.

234
00:17:38,399 --> 00:17:39,933
They weren't.
They were only--

235
00:17:39,984 --> 00:17:41,685
Only what?

236
00:17:41,736 --> 00:17:43,520
- I can't.
- Tell me.

237
00:17:43,571 --> 00:17:45,022
I can't, not unless
the master says.

238
00:17:45,073 --> 00:17:46,440
- Tell me. They weren't what?
- They weren't--

239
00:17:46,442 --> 00:17:49,276
Tell me why Bran
and Rickon should be gone

240
00:17:49,327 --> 00:17:50,944
while you still breathe the air.

241
00:17:50,995 --> 00:17:52,246
Tell me to my face, Theon.

242
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,114
Tell me that they
weren't your brothers!

243
00:17:54,116 --> 00:17:55,666
They weren't Bran and Rickon!

244
00:17:57,669 --> 00:18:00,120
I couldn't find them.

245
00:18:06,461 --> 00:18:08,428
It was two farm boys.

246
00:18:12,433 --> 00:18:15,519
I killed them and burned
them so no one would know.

247
00:18:20,391 --> 00:18:22,976
You didn't?

248
00:18:23,027 --> 00:18:25,279
Do you know where they
went, Bran and Rickon?

249
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:26,897
I can't talk to you anymore.

250
00:18:26,948 --> 00:18:28,649
Theon, you have to tell me.
Do you have any idea where--

251
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:31,151
Not Theon! Reek!

252
00:18:36,658 --> 00:18:39,493
Our scouts tell us he's got
no more than 6,000 men.

253
00:18:39,495 --> 00:18:41,995
More than half of those
are mounted, however.

254
00:18:41,997 --> 00:18:44,998
And how high do
Stannis's horses jump?

255
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,384
Our walls have been
fully repaired.

256
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:49,419
The gates have been reinforced.

257
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:52,506
We have enough food
for six months.

258
00:18:52,557 --> 00:18:56,343
We are more prepared for a
siege than they could ever be.

259
00:18:56,394 --> 00:18:59,012
All we have to do is
wait for them to freeze,

260
00:18:59,014 --> 00:19:01,848
starve, and mutiny.

261
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:06,086
You disagree?

262
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,438
Stannis isn't from the North.

263
00:19:08,489 --> 00:19:10,524
You are, Father.

264
00:19:10,526 --> 00:19:13,794
I think you're missing an opportunity
to show the people of the North

265
00:19:13,828 --> 00:19:16,496
<i>how House Bolton</i>
<i>treats southern invaders.</i>

266
00:19:16,531 --> 00:19:17,781
And what do you recommend?

267
00:19:17,832 --> 00:19:19,116
<i>That we not sit</i>
<i>and wait for Stannis</i>

268
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:21,702
<i>to decide what sort of
fight this is going to be.</i>

269
00:19:21,704 --> 00:19:23,787
That we hit first and hit hard

270
00:19:23,838 --> 00:19:26,206
and leave a feast for the crows.

271
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:29,209
A smart commander does not
abandon a defensive advantage.

272
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:31,628
<i>As long as we stay</i>
<i>behind these walls,</i>

273
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:32,963
<i>they can't touch us.</i>

274
00:19:33,014 --> 00:19:34,881
Not to mention
that the snow is so deep,

275
00:19:34,933 --> 00:19:36,693
we couldn't get an army
through to engage them

276
00:19:36,718 --> 00:19:38,018
even if we wanted to.

277
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:40,304
I don't need an army.

278
00:19:40,355 --> 00:19:42,856
I need 20 good men.

279
00:19:50,698 --> 00:19:52,416
So, have you decided yet?

280
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:54,901
Whether I'm worthy
of your service?

281
00:19:56,955 --> 00:20:00,490
Have you decided yet whether
you're going to have me killed?

282
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:02,743
It's probably my safest option.

283
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,798
I can see why
you would think so.

284
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:10,050
It's what your father
would have done.

285
00:20:11,302 --> 00:20:12,742
And what would
your father have done?

286
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:16,423
My father,

287
00:20:16,425 --> 00:20:19,426
who publically
sentenced me to death?

288
00:20:19,477 --> 00:20:21,979
I'd say his thoughts on having
me killed were abundantly clear.

289
00:20:22,013 --> 00:20:23,597
Is that why you killed him?

290
00:20:26,985 --> 00:20:30,270
Someday, if you decide
not to execute me,

291
00:20:30,272 --> 00:20:32,439
I'll tell you all about
why I killed my father.

292
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:35,742
And on that day,
should it ever come,

293
00:20:35,777 --> 00:20:38,078
we'll need more wine than this.

294
00:20:40,415 --> 00:20:42,783
I know what my father was.

295
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:45,369
<i>What he did.</i>

296
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:47,754
I know the Mad King
earned his name.

297
00:20:50,508 --> 00:20:53,543
So, here we sit.

298
00:20:53,628 --> 00:20:56,596
Two terrible children
of two terrible fathers.

299
00:20:56,631 --> 00:20:58,298
I'm terrible?

300
00:20:58,349 --> 00:21:00,467
I've heard stories.

301
00:21:00,518 --> 00:21:03,854
Why did you travel to the far side of
the world to meet someone terrible?

302
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:06,640
- To see if you were the right kind of terrible.
- Which kind is that?

303
00:21:06,642 --> 00:21:09,776
The kind that prevents your
people from being even more so.

304
00:21:11,779 --> 00:21:13,814
Well, I did reopen
the fighting pits.

305
00:21:13,865 --> 00:21:16,650
Under my rule, murder will once
again become entertainment.

306
00:21:16,701 --> 00:21:18,452
Yes, that was wise.

307
00:21:18,486 --> 00:21:21,738
And you agreed to marry someone
you loathe for the greater good.

308
00:21:21,823 --> 00:21:24,658
Very impressive.

309
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:27,227
<i>My own sister married someone
she loathed as well,</i>

310
00:21:27,261 --> 00:21:29,796
though not by choice
and certainly not

311
00:21:29,831 --> 00:21:31,748
for the greater good,
gods forbid.

312
00:21:31,799 --> 00:21:33,517
She ended up having him killed.

313
00:21:35,353 --> 00:21:37,771
Perhaps it won't come to that.

314
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:48,482
It's not impossible that Varys
was right about you after all.

315
00:21:48,516 --> 00:21:51,685
Varys?
King Robert's spymaster?

316
00:21:51,736 --> 00:21:55,238
Yes, he's the one who convinced
me to come find you.

317
00:21:55,273 --> 00:21:56,857
He was my travelling companion

318
00:21:56,908 --> 00:21:59,192
before Ser Jorah seized
that role for himself.

319
00:21:59,243 --> 00:22:01,912
Jorah sent my secrets to Varys.

320
00:22:01,946 --> 00:22:05,699
For 20 years the Spider oversaw
the campaign to find and kill me.

321
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:08,535
He did what he had
to do to survive.

322
00:22:08,537 --> 00:22:11,705
He did a lot of other things as
well, things he didn't have to do.

323
00:22:11,739 --> 00:22:15,625
<i>I suspect he's the main reason you
weren't slaughtered in your crib.</i>

324
00:22:15,676 --> 00:22:17,427
But you trust him?

325
00:22:17,462 --> 00:22:18,962
<i>Yes, oddly.</i>

326
00:22:19,013 --> 00:22:22,215
He may be the only person
in the world I trust.

327
00:22:22,266 --> 00:22:24,134
Except my brother.

328
00:22:24,185 --> 00:22:27,220
The brother
who killed my father?

329
00:22:27,222 --> 00:22:28,305
That's the one.

330
00:22:28,389 --> 00:22:30,140
Perhaps I will have you
killed after all.

331
00:22:30,191 --> 00:22:32,392
Your queenly prerogative.

332
00:22:34,479 --> 00:22:37,030
I had given up on life

333
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:40,484
until Varys convinced me
you might be worth living for.

334
00:22:40,551 --> 00:22:42,953
If you chop off my head, well,

335
00:22:42,987 --> 00:22:45,038
my final days were interesting.

336
00:22:51,195 --> 00:22:53,180
I'm not going to kill you.

337
00:22:55,133 --> 00:22:57,968
No? Banish me?

338
00:22:58,002 --> 00:22:59,753
No.

339
00:22:59,787 --> 00:23:01,421
So if I'm not going
to be murdered

340
00:23:01,472 --> 00:23:02,889
and I'm not going
to be banished--

341
00:23:02,924 --> 00:23:04,341
You're going to advise me.

342
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:08,478
While you can still speak
in complete sentences.

343
00:23:12,433 --> 00:23:13,767
Advise you on what?

344
00:23:13,769 --> 00:23:15,352
How to get what I want.

345
00:23:15,403 --> 00:23:17,938
The Iron Throne.

346
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:20,941
Perhaps you should try
wanting something else.

347
00:23:20,943 --> 00:23:23,443
If I want jokes, I'll get
myself a proper fool.

348
00:23:23,445 --> 00:23:25,779
<i>I'm not entirely joking.</i>

349
00:23:25,781 --> 00:23:28,281
<i>There's more to the world</i>
<i>than Westeros after all.</i>

350
00:23:28,283 --> 00:23:32,619
How many hundreds of thousands of lives
have you changed for the better here?

351
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:34,588
Perhaps this
is where you belong,

352
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:36,623
where you can do the most good.

353
00:23:38,793 --> 00:23:41,511
I fought so that no child
born into Slaver's Bay

354
00:23:41,546 --> 00:23:44,631
would ever know what it
meant to be bought or sold.

355
00:23:44,682 --> 00:23:48,218
<i>I will continue</i>
<i>that fight here and beyond.</i>

356
00:23:48,269 --> 00:23:49,803
But this is not my home.

357
00:23:49,854 --> 00:23:52,606
When you get back to your
home, who supports you?

358
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,140
The common people.

359
00:23:54,192 --> 00:23:56,810
Let's be generous and assume
that's going to happen.

360
00:23:56,812 --> 00:23:59,479
Here in Slaver's Bay, you had the
support of the common people

361
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:01,982
and only the common people.

362
00:24:01,984 --> 00:24:05,869
What was that like?
Ruling without the rich?

363
00:24:05,903 --> 00:24:08,371
House Targaryen is gone.

364
00:24:08,406 --> 00:24:11,157
Not a single person who shares your
blood is alive to support you.

365
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:13,159
<i>The Starks are gone as well.</i>

366
00:24:13,211 --> 00:24:15,128
<i>Our two terrible fathers</i>
<i>saw to that.</i>

367
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:16,802
<i>The remaining members</i>
<i>of House Lannister</i>

368
00:24:16,831 --> 00:24:18,832
<i>will never back you, not ever.</i>

369
00:24:18,834 --> 00:24:21,134
Stannis Baratheon
won't back you, either.

370
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:24,638
His entire claim to the throne rests
on the illegitimacy of yours.

371
00:24:24,672 --> 00:24:26,756
<i>That leaves the Tyrells.</i>

372
00:24:26,807 --> 00:24:29,426
Not impossible, not enough.

373
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:33,563
Lannister, Targaryen,
Baratheon, Stark, Tyrell.

374
00:24:33,598 --> 00:24:35,765
They're all just spokes
on a wheel.

375
00:24:35,816 --> 00:24:38,101
This one's on top,
then that one's on top.

376
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:42,322
And on and on it spins,
crushing those on the ground.

377
00:24:42,356 --> 00:24:46,076
It's a beautiful dream,
stopping the wheel.

378
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:48,778
You're not the first person
who's ever dreamt it.

379
00:24:48,829 --> 00:24:51,748
I'm not going to stop the wheel.

380
00:24:53,084 --> 00:24:55,535
I'm going to break the wheel.

381
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:22,395
You said whoever wins will fight at
the Great Pit in front of the queen.

382
00:25:22,446 --> 00:25:24,397
I won.

383
00:25:24,399 --> 00:25:27,567
- You struck me.
- Have me flogged if it makes you happy.

384
00:25:27,569 --> 00:25:30,737
But I'm the best you've got.

385
00:25:30,788 --> 00:25:33,573
If I win at the Great Pit,

386
00:25:33,624 --> 00:25:35,542
how much can you sell me for?

387
00:25:38,412 --> 00:25:39,913
You're a free man.

388
00:25:39,997 --> 00:25:42,215
You could have gone anywhere.

389
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:43,917
Why did you come back?

390
00:25:48,806 --> 00:25:50,757
Let me fight for her

391
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:52,809
and I belong to you.

392
00:25:58,065 --> 00:26:00,900
<i>Thirsty?</i>

393
00:26:00,968 --> 00:26:02,819
Confess.

394
00:26:06,407 --> 00:26:09,609
I'll get out of here,
you realize, before long.

395
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:10,860
Confess.

396
00:26:10,911 --> 00:26:14,164
I can make you a wealthy woman.

397
00:26:14,198 --> 00:26:15,882
A lady of the court.

398
00:26:15,916 --> 00:26:17,417
Confess.

399
00:26:22,056 --> 00:26:25,709
Or I can make sure you die in the
most hideous way imaginable.

400
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,011
And all I do is sit here

401
00:26:28,045 --> 00:26:30,880
imagining hideous ways
for you to die.

402
00:27:16,227 --> 00:27:18,178
Does it hurt?

403
00:27:19,647 --> 00:27:21,681
No.

404
00:27:21,683 --> 00:27:23,933
Good.

405
00:27:27,188 --> 00:27:29,239
How are you?

406
00:27:29,273 --> 00:27:32,909
I'm not the one who got punched
and kicked in the face.

407
00:27:34,862 --> 00:27:36,780
You know what I mean.

408
00:27:38,582 --> 00:27:39,916
I'm good.

409
00:27:41,085 --> 00:27:43,536
- Are you scared?
- A little.

410
00:27:43,538 --> 00:27:45,538
Me, too.

411
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,960
- Who's there?
- <i> Olly.</i>

412
00:27:51,011 --> 00:27:53,012
Oh.

413
00:27:53,047 --> 00:27:54,881
Come in.

414
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:59,385
I heard what happened.

415
00:27:59,387 --> 00:28:02,138
Oh, not to worry.

416
00:28:02,189 --> 00:28:05,391
Men brawl from time to time.
It's only natural.

417
00:28:07,978 --> 00:28:09,562
Figured you were hungry.

418
00:28:09,564 --> 00:28:13,149
Oh, you're a good lad.

419
00:28:14,985 --> 00:28:17,320
Wanted to ask you something

420
00:28:17,371 --> 00:28:19,205
if you've got the time.

421
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,541
I need to check on baby Sam.

422
00:28:28,699 --> 00:28:31,918
<i>Now then, how can I help?</i>

423
00:28:33,387 --> 00:28:35,305
- It's about the Lord Commander.
- Yes?

424
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:38,424
He's going up to Hardhome
to save all them wildlings.

425
00:28:40,394 --> 00:28:43,663
Wildlings killed my mom and dad.

426
00:28:43,697 --> 00:28:45,398
They killed everyone
in my village.

427
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:47,150
We've been
fighting them for years.

428
00:28:47,234 --> 00:28:48,818
<i>This wasn't a fight.</i>

429
00:28:48,853 --> 00:28:52,372
We were farmers
and they slaughtered us.

430
00:28:53,941 --> 00:28:55,692
So why is he saving them?

431
00:28:55,743 --> 00:28:57,944
Wildlings are people.

432
00:28:57,946 --> 00:29:01,281
Just like us, there are
good ones and bad ones.

433
00:29:01,332 --> 00:29:04,751
The one he's travelling with,
the one with the red beard,

434
00:29:04,785 --> 00:29:06,753
he led the raid on my village.

435
00:29:06,787 --> 00:29:09,088
- <i> Oh, Olly.</i>
- How can he trust him?

436
00:29:10,508 --> 00:29:13,176
I've seen the army of the dead.

437
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:16,212
<i>I've seen the white walkers.</i>

438
00:29:16,247 --> 00:29:18,965
And they're coming for
us, for all the living.

439
00:29:21,268 --> 00:29:24,437
And when it's time,

440
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:27,473
we'll need every
last man we can find.

441
00:29:27,475 --> 00:29:30,476
But what if we let the
wildlings through the gates

442
00:29:30,561 --> 00:29:32,362
and they cut our throats
while we sleep?

443
00:29:32,396 --> 00:29:34,781
Jon's taking a risk,
but he has to.

444
00:29:34,815 --> 00:29:37,483
We don't stand
a chance otherwise.

445
00:29:37,535 --> 00:29:41,487
<i>Sometimes a man</i>
<i>has to make hard choices,</i>

446
00:29:41,489 --> 00:29:43,406
<i>choices that might look</i>
<i>wrong to others,</i>

447
00:29:43,457 --> 00:29:46,209
<i>but you know are right</i>
<i>in the long run.</i>

448
00:29:46,243 --> 00:29:47,961
You believe that?

449
00:29:47,995 --> 00:29:50,129
With all my heart.

450
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:58,972
<i>Try not to worry, Olly.</i>

451
00:29:59,006 --> 00:30:01,975
I've been worrying
about Jon for years.

452
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:03,977
He always comes back.

453
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:48,221
<i>Turn us about!</i>

454
00:31:20,838 --> 00:31:23,423
You trust me, Jon Snow?

455
00:31:23,474 --> 00:31:25,642
Does that make me a fool?

456
00:31:25,676 --> 00:31:27,927
We're fools together now.

457
00:31:44,445 --> 00:31:47,330
Lord of Bones.

458
00:31:47,414 --> 00:31:49,782
Been a long time.

459
00:31:49,833 --> 00:31:52,702
Last time I saw you, the
little crow was your prisoner.

460
00:31:52,753 --> 00:31:55,121
The other way around now.
What happened?

461
00:31:55,123 --> 00:31:56,756
War.

462
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:59,676
War?
You call that a war?

463
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:01,878
The greatest army
the North has ever seen

464
00:32:01,929 --> 00:32:04,931
cut to pieces
by some southern king.

465
00:32:04,965 --> 00:32:07,100
We should gather the elders,

466
00:32:07,134 --> 00:32:09,018
find somewhere quiet to talk.

467
00:32:09,103 --> 00:32:10,970
You don't give the orders here.

468
00:32:10,972 --> 00:32:13,022
I'm not giving an order.

469
00:32:14,725 --> 00:32:16,559
Why aren't you in chains?

470
00:32:17,561 --> 00:32:19,979
He's not my prisoner.

471
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:21,280
No?

472
00:32:21,315 --> 00:32:23,149
What is he?

473
00:32:23,151 --> 00:32:24,867
We're allies.

474
00:32:26,453 --> 00:32:29,155
You fucking traitor.

475
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:33,960
You fight for the crows now?

476
00:32:36,046 --> 00:32:38,581
I don't fight for the crows.

477
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,503
We're not here to fight.
We're here to talk.

478
00:32:43,554 --> 00:32:45,922
Is that right?

479
00:32:45,973 --> 00:32:49,342
You and the pretty crow
do a lot of talking, Tormund?

480
00:32:49,344 --> 00:32:51,511
And when you're done talking,

481
00:32:51,513 --> 00:32:54,180
do you get down on your
knees and suck his cock?

482
00:33:09,863 --> 00:33:12,949
Gather the elders
and let's talk.

483
00:33:38,859 --> 00:33:41,227
My name's Jon Snow.

484
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:45,064
I'm Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch.

485
00:33:47,785 --> 00:33:50,119
We're not friends.

486
00:33:50,154 --> 00:33:53,489
<i>We've never been friends.</i>

487
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:55,958
<i>We won't become friends today.</i>

488
00:33:57,544 --> 00:33:59,629
<i>This isn't about friendship.</i>

489
00:34:01,498 --> 00:34:03,666
This is about survival.

490
00:34:03,717 --> 00:34:05,751
This is about putting
a 700-foot wall

491
00:34:05,753 --> 00:34:08,337
between you
and what's out there.

492
00:34:08,388 --> 00:34:10,089
You built that wall
to keep us out.

493
00:34:10,091 --> 00:34:13,092
Since when do the crows
give two shits if we live?

494
00:34:13,143 --> 00:34:15,978
<i>In normal times we wouldn't.
But these aren't normal times.</i>

495
00:34:16,013 --> 00:34:19,432
The white walkers don't care
if a man's free folk or crow.

496
00:34:19,434 --> 00:34:22,602
We're all the same to them,
meat for their army.

497
00:34:22,653 --> 00:34:24,770
But together we can beat them.

498
00:34:24,822 --> 00:34:26,939
Beat the white walkers?

499
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:29,859
Good luck with that.
Run from them, maybe.

500
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:41,787
It's not a trick.

501
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:47,627
It's a gift
for those who join us.

502
00:34:52,466 --> 00:34:55,468
Dragonglass.

503
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:58,471
A man of the Night's Watch
used one of these daggers

504
00:34:58,522 --> 00:35:00,606
<i>to kill a walker.</i>

505
00:35:00,641 --> 00:35:03,059
- You saw this?
- No.

506
00:35:03,143 --> 00:35:04,644
But I trust the man.

507
00:35:04,695 --> 00:35:07,280
There are old stories
about dragonglass.

508
00:35:07,314 --> 00:35:10,783
There are old stories about
ice spiders as big as hounds.

509
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:12,985
And with the things we've
seen, you don't believe them?

510
00:35:12,987 --> 00:35:15,821
<i>Come with me and
I'll share these weapons.</i>

511
00:35:15,823 --> 00:35:17,373
Come with you where?

512
00:35:17,407 --> 00:35:19,167
<i>There are good lands
south of the Wall.</i>

513
00:35:19,209 --> 00:35:20,993
<i>The Night's Watch will let you</i>
<i>through the tunnel</i>

514
00:35:20,995 --> 00:35:23,412
and allow your people
to farm those lands.

515
00:35:26,501 --> 00:35:28,668
I knew Mance Rayder.

516
00:35:28,752 --> 00:35:30,887
<i>He never wanted a war</i>
<i>with the Night's Watch.</i>

517
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:33,422
<i>He wanted a new life</i>
<i>for his people, for you.</i>

518
00:35:33,473 --> 00:35:35,892
We're prepared
to give you that new life.

519
00:35:35,926 --> 00:35:37,560
If?

520
00:35:37,594 --> 00:35:40,897
If you swear you'll join us
when the real war begins.

521
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:44,934
Where is Mance?

522
00:35:48,272 --> 00:35:51,023
- He died.
- How?

523
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,281
I put an arrow
through his heart.

524
00:35:58,332 --> 00:36:00,533
Hey, hey.

525
00:36:00,617 --> 00:36:02,668
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

526
00:36:04,838 --> 00:36:06,205
Hey, hey, hey.

527
00:36:06,256 --> 00:36:07,873
<i>I say we send the Lord Commander</i>

528
00:36:07,925 --> 00:36:11,711
back to Castle Black
with no eyes.

529
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,681
Hey, none of you saw Mance die.

530
00:36:15,716 --> 00:36:17,383
I did.

531
00:36:17,434 --> 00:36:20,853
The southern king who
broke our army, Stannis,

532
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:23,522
wanted to burn him alive
to send us a message.

533
00:36:23,557 --> 00:36:26,525
Jon Snow defied
that cunt's orders.

534
00:36:27,728 --> 00:36:29,895
His arrow was mercy.

535
00:36:31,031 --> 00:36:32,315
What he did took courage.

536
00:36:32,366 --> 00:36:34,066
And that's what we need today,

537
00:36:34,101 --> 00:36:35,735
the courage to make peace

538
00:36:35,737 --> 00:36:38,988
with men we've been
killing for generations.

539
00:36:39,039 --> 00:36:41,240
I lost my father, my uncle,

540
00:36:41,242 --> 00:36:43,626
and two brothers
fighting the damn crows.

541
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:46,746
I'm not asking you
to forget your dead.

542
00:36:46,797 --> 00:36:48,914
I'll never forget mine.

543
00:36:50,751 --> 00:36:55,004
I lost 50 brothers the night
that Mance attacked the Wall.

544
00:36:55,973 --> 00:36:58,257
But I'm asking you

545
00:36:58,308 --> 00:37:00,393
to think about
your children now.

546
00:37:02,262 --> 00:37:03,902
<i>They'll never have</i>
<i>children of their own</i>

547
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:06,349
<i>if we don't band together.</i>

548
00:37:06,433 --> 00:37:09,235
The Long Night is coming

549
00:37:09,269 --> 00:37:11,237
and the dead come with it.

550
00:37:11,271 --> 00:37:13,939
No clan can stop them.

551
00:37:13,991 --> 00:37:15,825
The free folk can't stop them.

552
00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:17,276
The Night's Watch
can't stop them.

553
00:37:17,327 --> 00:37:20,746
And all the southern
kings can't stop them.

554
00:37:21,882 --> 00:37:24,450
<i>Only together, all of us.</i>

555
00:37:24,501 --> 00:37:26,252
And even then
it may not be enough,

556
00:37:26,286 --> 00:37:28,537
but at least we'll give
the fuckers a fight.

557
00:37:44,104 --> 00:37:46,639
You vouch for this man, Tormund?

558
00:37:49,226 --> 00:37:52,228
He's prettier
than both my daughters,

559
00:37:52,279 --> 00:37:54,146
<i>but he knows how to fight.</i>

560
00:37:54,148 --> 00:37:57,033
He's young, but he
knows how to lead.

561
00:37:58,535 --> 00:38:00,202
He didn't have
to come to Hardhome.

562
00:38:00,237 --> 00:38:04,373
He came because he needs us

563
00:38:04,408 --> 00:38:06,459
and we need him.

564
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:12,331
My ancestors would spit on me

565
00:38:12,382 --> 00:38:14,500
if I broke bread with a crow.

566
00:38:14,551 --> 00:38:17,420
So would mine, but fuck
'em, they're dead.

567
00:38:26,813 --> 00:38:29,098
I'll never trust a man in black.

568
00:38:33,186 --> 00:38:35,688
But I trust you, Tormund.

569
00:38:35,739 --> 00:38:39,075
If you say this is the way,

570
00:38:39,109 --> 00:38:40,359
we're with you.

571
00:38:44,448 --> 00:38:47,032
This is the way.

572
00:38:48,085 --> 00:38:49,869
<i>I'm with Tormund.</i>

573
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,254
We stay here, we're dead men.

574
00:38:53,957 --> 00:38:56,959
At least with King Crow,
there's a chance.

575
00:38:59,679 --> 00:39:02,798
Tormund.

576
00:39:05,852 --> 00:39:08,637
Keep that new life
you want to give us.

577
00:39:11,391 --> 00:39:13,976
And keep your glass, King Crow.

578
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:19,815
As soon as you get on his ships,
they're gonna slit your throats

579
00:39:19,866 --> 00:39:22,818
and dump your bodies to the
bottom of the Shivering Sea.

580
00:39:24,821 --> 00:39:26,822
That's our enemy.

581
00:39:28,458 --> 00:39:30,576
That has always been our enemy.

582
00:39:46,476 --> 00:39:48,260
I fucking hate Thenns.

583
00:40:08,231 --> 00:40:10,783
- Move it.
- Be careful.

584
00:40:10,785 --> 00:40:12,668
<i>- Move 'em along, now.</i>
<i>- Cast-off time.</i>

585
00:40:12,702 --> 00:40:14,670
<i>That's it, come on.</i>

586
00:40:17,374 --> 00:40:19,842
How many are with us?
5,000?

587
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:22,044
I'm not good at counting.

588
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:25,097
We're leaving too many behind.

589
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:26,632
The free folk are stubborn.

590
00:40:26,634 --> 00:40:29,134
You know how long it took
Mance to band them together?

591
00:40:29,186 --> 00:40:31,687
20 fucking years.

592
00:40:31,771 --> 00:40:34,773
And he knew them better
than I ever will.

593
00:40:34,808 --> 00:40:39,111
They're running out of food
and there's nothing to hunt.

594
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:40,646
They'll come around.

595
00:40:43,483 --> 00:40:45,985
<i>- Get yourselves ready.</i>
<i>- Aye!</i>

596
00:40:45,987 --> 00:40:47,786
Johnna is gonna look after you.

597
00:40:47,821 --> 00:40:50,573
She's in charge.
You listen to her.

598
00:40:51,658 --> 00:40:54,293
<i>Take her. There you are.</i>

599
00:40:54,327 --> 00:40:55,661
I want to go with you.

600
00:40:55,663 --> 00:40:58,330
I need to get the old
folks on the boats.

601
00:40:58,332 --> 00:41:00,583
I'm right behind you.
I promise.

602
00:41:04,504 --> 00:41:06,138
Go on.

603
00:41:08,508 --> 00:41:09,725
<i>Another one.</i>

604
00:41:09,759 --> 00:41:12,678
<i>Keep moving.</i>
<i>We'll meet you out there.</i>

605
00:41:15,348 --> 00:41:17,983
<i>Won't be able to take that on the boat.
It's too big.</i>

606
00:41:18,018 --> 00:41:21,520
- <i> That's the last one!</i>
- <i> Three more! Move on!</i>

607
00:41:21,522 --> 00:41:25,107
<i>There's more dragonglass everywhere.</i>

608
00:41:31,364 --> 00:41:34,116
<i>I've got some more daggers</i>
<i>over here.</i>

609
00:41:34,167 --> 00:41:36,585
<i>Put that dagger in his bag.</i>

610
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:41,206
Uh...

611
00:42:32,892 --> 00:42:36,729
<i>Steady!</i>

612
00:42:54,447 --> 00:42:56,498
Shut the gates.

613
00:42:56,583 --> 00:42:58,334
<i>Close the gates!</i>

614
00:43:02,622 --> 00:43:04,456
Shut the gates!

615
00:43:07,844 --> 00:43:09,962
Wait!

616
00:43:10,013 --> 00:43:12,765
- Open the gate!
- Let us in!

617
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,968
Help us!

618
00:43:25,645 --> 00:43:27,980
<i>Please open it!</i>

619
00:43:28,031 --> 00:43:30,566
<i>Open the gate!</i>

620
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:18,280
<i>Ready your arrows!</i>

621
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:40,719
- Wait! Wait!
- Keep in line! Keep in line!

622
00:44:40,721 --> 00:44:43,055
Get in line!

623
00:45:43,166 --> 00:45:45,784
Get to the front!

624
00:45:45,835 --> 00:45:47,786
<i>Go on, shoot it!</i>

625
00:45:54,294 --> 00:45:58,463
- Wait, wait!
<i>- Duncan, hold the line! Hold the line!</i>

626
00:46:02,936 --> 00:46:04,970
Lord Commander!

627
00:46:05,054 --> 00:46:07,356
Get them to the ship
and come back for me!

628
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:09,024
- But you'll never make--
- Now!

629
00:46:12,061 --> 00:46:15,063
- Let me on!
- Let me on!

630
00:46:15,148 --> 00:46:17,282
- Bloody fucking move!
- Let go!

631
00:46:18,484 --> 00:46:19,985
You should be on
one of those boats.

632
00:46:19,987 --> 00:46:22,704
So should you.
My little girls got on.

633
00:46:22,739 --> 00:46:24,907
They're gonna let them pass the
Wall even if you're not there?

634
00:46:24,991 --> 00:46:27,576
You have my word.
I've given orders.

635
00:46:27,627 --> 00:46:30,329
Don't think you're gonna be
there to enforce those orders.

636
00:46:32,499 --> 00:46:34,967
If they get through,
everyone dies.

637
00:46:38,555 --> 00:46:41,473
Night's Watch, with me!

638
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:44,810
Move! Move!

639
00:46:44,844 --> 00:46:46,645
Move!

640
00:47:51,794 --> 00:47:52,911
No, no!

641
00:48:02,755 --> 00:48:05,557
<i>- Tormund, the sleigh!</i>
- Okay, okay!

642
00:48:53,806 --> 00:48:55,190
The dragonglass.

643
00:48:55,224 --> 00:48:57,309
You and me, then!

644
00:48:58,361 --> 00:48:59,978
Go!

645
00:50:10,049 --> 00:50:12,050
Get the glass.

646
00:53:17,536 --> 00:53:19,237
Come on!

647
00:53:19,239 --> 00:53:20,905
The dragonglass.

648
00:53:20,907 --> 00:53:24,409
Fuck the glass!
We are gonna die here!

649
00:53:54,907 --> 00:53:57,442
Oh, fuck!

650
00:54:03,449 --> 00:54:06,284
<i>Tormund, run!</i>

651
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:17,595
Wun Wun, to the sea.

652
00:54:58,671 --> 00:55:01,172
<i>Quickly!</i>

653
00:55:01,257 --> 00:55:03,675
- <i> Faster, faster!</i>
- <i> Run, run!</i>

654
00:55:03,726 --> 00:55:05,677
<i>Quickly!</i>

655
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:10,682
- Quickly, row! Row!
- Go, go, come on!

656
00:55:39,678 --> 00:55:42,847
Let's go!
Now, now!

657
00:55:46,852 --> 00:55:49,104
<i>Come on, row!</i>
