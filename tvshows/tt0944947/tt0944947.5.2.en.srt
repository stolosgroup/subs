2
00:02:01,612 --> 00:02:05,067
In old times, whenever
Braavos stood in danger,

3
00:02:05,187 --> 00:02:08,859
the Titan would step with fire in its eyes,

4
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:12,874
wade into the sea and smash the enemies.

5
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:16,220
It's just a statue.

6
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:24,845
Haha. Don't be afraid. He's
announcing our arrival.

7
00:02:25,886 --> 00:02:29,603
I'm not afraid.

8
00:03:36,204 --> 00:03:39,118
The House of Black and White.

9
00:03:39,238 --> 00:03:42,747
This is where you'll find
the man you seek.

10
00:03:46,911 --> 00:03:50,361
Here, I leave you.

11
00:03:57,324 --> 00:04:01,484
- Thank you for bringing me.
- Any man in Braavos would have done the same.

12
00:04:03,268 --> 00:04:07,075
- Valar morghulis.
- Valar dohaeris.

13
00:04:42,396 --> 00:04:44,364
Hello.

14
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:49,837
Valar morghulis.

15
00:04:59,677 --> 00:05:02,268
Jaqen H'ghar gave me this.

16
00:05:05,742 --> 00:05:09,938
- No one here by that name.
- Please!

17
00:05:10,058 --> 00:05:13,448
I've crossed the Narrow Sea.
I have nowhere else to go.

18
00:05:13,568 --> 00:05:18,206
- You have everywhere else to go.
- But wait!

19
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,486
Cersei...Walder Frey...

20
00:05:41,606 --> 00:05:46,840
The Mountain...Meryn Trant.

21
00:05:47,955 --> 00:05:53,457
Cersei...Walder Frey...

22
00:05:54,201 --> 00:05:58,736
The Mountain...Meryn Trant.

23
00:05:58,856 --> 00:06:00,248
Cersei...

24
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:01,924
Walder Frey...

25
00:06:02,044 --> 00:06:03,620
The Mountain...

26
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,812
Meryn Trant.

27
00:06:07,761 --> 00:06:09,102
Cersei...

28
00:06:09,222 --> 00:06:10,540
Walder Frey...

29
00:06:11,076 --> 00:06:12,224
The Mountain...

30
00:06:12,748 --> 00:06:14,045
Meryn Trant.

31
00:06:15,266 --> 00:06:16,351
Cersei...

32
00:06:17,761 --> 00:06:19,133
Walder Frey...

33
00:06:20,565 --> 00:06:22,690
The Mountain...

34
00:06:23,606 --> 00:06:26,003
Meryn Trant...

35
00:06:56,607 --> 00:06:58,663
Must be good food if it's crowded.

36
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:05,477
Ale?

37
00:07:11,876 --> 00:07:13,818
Ale?

38
00:07:21,616 --> 00:07:24,757
Before we left, a maester
gave you a raven's scroll.

39
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:29,991
You are becoming an observant young lady.

40
00:07:30,111 --> 00:07:32,774
My mother used to say "dark wings dark words".

41
00:07:32,894 --> 00:07:36,653
An old saying. Inaccurate in this case.

42
00:07:39,033 --> 00:07:41,031
So it's good news.

43
00:07:41,151 --> 00:07:43,506
My marriage proposal has been accepted.

44
00:07:43,626 --> 00:07:46,313
I thought you still mourned the
death of my beloved Aunt Lysa.

45
00:07:46,433 --> 00:07:49,454
- Ale?
- I'll have some.

46
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,582
My Lady...

47
00:07:55,702 --> 00:07:58,856
- What is it?
- Sansa Stark. Don't look!

48
00:08:00,335 --> 00:08:01,242
You sure?

49
00:08:01,362 --> 00:08:02,818
She's dyed her hair, but it's her.

50
00:08:02,938 --> 00:08:04,545
She's sitting with Petyr Baelish.

51
00:08:04,665 --> 00:08:05,583
Littlefinger?

52
00:08:05,703 --> 00:08:07,195
A bunch of knights with them.

53
00:08:07,315 --> 00:08:09,428
Bunch? Bunch...Six? Twenty?

54
00:08:09,548 --> 00:08:10,937
Ten, I think. Too many.

55
00:08:11,664 --> 00:08:12,985
My Lady, I don't think this is...

56
00:08:13,069 --> 00:08:14,358
Ready the horses!

57
00:08:14,478 --> 00:08:15,996
We only have one horse.

58
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,430
Find more!

59
00:08:23,657 --> 00:08:24,904
Do you like the taste?

60
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:27,623
Don't see what all the fuss is about.

61
00:08:28,347 --> 00:08:30,680
Why do men love it so much?

62
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,750
It gives some men courage.

63
00:08:33,148 --> 00:08:34,720
Does it give you courage?

64
00:08:37,489 --> 00:08:38,724
That's far enough.

65
00:08:40,658 --> 00:08:42,055
Lord Baelish.

66
00:08:42,554 --> 00:08:43,814
Lady Sansa.

67
00:08:44,193 --> 00:08:46,051
My name is Brienne of Tarth.

68
00:08:46,171 --> 00:08:48,571
We've met, with Renly Baratheon.

69
00:08:49,469 --> 00:08:50,879
What did he say about you?

70
00:08:51,527 --> 00:08:52,600
He said,

71
00:08:53,798 --> 00:08:56,530
Your loyalty came free of charge.

72
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:00,634
Someone appears to have paid
quite a bit for it since then.

73
00:09:14,185 --> 00:09:15,620
Lady Sansa.

74
00:09:17,042 --> 00:09:18,452
Before your mother's death,

75
00:09:18,813 --> 00:09:20,647
I was her sworn sword.

76
00:09:21,383 --> 00:09:24,277
I gave my word I will
find you and protect you.

77
00:09:24,601 --> 00:09:25,961
I will shield your back

78
00:09:26,081 --> 00:09:27,277
and keep your counsel,

79
00:09:27,576 --> 00:09:29,984
and give my life for you if needs be.

80
00:09:30,489 --> 00:09:33,233
I swear it by the Old Gods and the New.

81
00:09:34,612 --> 00:09:36,471
Please, Lady Brienne.

82
00:09:36,733 --> 00:09:38,504
No need for such formality.

83
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:41,149
You were Catelyn Stark's sworn sword.

84
00:09:41,269 --> 00:09:43,082
- I was.
- Strange.

85
00:09:43,444 --> 00:09:46,183
I knew Cat since the time we were children.
She never mentioned you.

86
00:09:46,934 --> 00:09:48,680
It was after Renly's murder.

87
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,002
Ah, yes.

88
00:09:50,274 --> 00:09:51,896
You were accused of killing him.

89
00:09:52,016 --> 00:09:53,318
I tried to save him.

90
00:09:53,438 --> 00:09:56,409
- But you were accused.
- By men who did not see what happened.

91
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:57,781
And what did happen?

92
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,668
He was murdered by a shadow.

93
00:10:05,239 --> 00:10:07,827
A shadow with the face
of Stannis Baratheon.

94
00:10:07,947 --> 00:10:10,150
A shadow?

95
00:10:11,596 --> 00:10:13,119
With a face?

96
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,883
This woman swore to protect Renly,

97
00:10:18,003 --> 00:10:19,198
she failed.

98
00:10:19,318 --> 00:10:20,845
She swore to protect your mother,

99
00:10:21,706 --> 00:10:22,766
she failed.

100
00:10:23,221 --> 00:10:26,851
Why would I want somebody with your
history of failure guarding Lady Sansa?

101
00:10:26,971 --> 00:10:28,849
Why should you have any
say in her affairs?

102
00:10:28,969 --> 00:10:30,333
Because I am her uncle.

103
00:10:30,453 --> 00:10:33,938
I married her Aunt Lysa shortly
before my beloved's untimely death.

104
00:10:34,191 --> 00:10:37,022
We're family now. And you are an outsider.

105
00:10:37,142 --> 00:10:38,213
Forgive me, Lady Brienne.

106
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:41,260
But experience has made
me wary of outsiders.

107
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:42,745
Lady Sansa...

108
00:10:42,865 --> 00:10:45,015
- if we can have a word alone...
- No.

109
00:10:45,612 --> 00:10:48,693
- Please, my Lady, if I can explain...
- I saw you at Joffrey's wedding...

110
00:10:48,813 --> 00:10:49,996
bowing to the king.

111
00:10:50,221 --> 00:10:51,954
Neither of us wanted to be there.

112
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:56,588
- Sometimes we don't have a choice.
- And sometimes we do.

113
00:10:58,633 --> 00:10:59,831
You should leave.

114
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:04,172
We don't want our new friend
wandering the countryside alone.

115
00:11:04,292 --> 00:11:05,943
The roads in these parts aren't safe.

116
00:11:06,467 --> 00:11:07,802
Why don't you stay?

117
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:18,963
I'm gonna ask you to stay.

118
00:12:06,657 --> 00:12:08,478
Stop! Stop! After him!

119
00:12:10,099 --> 00:12:11,122
Podrick!

120
00:12:48,989 --> 00:12:50,560
Stop, stop, stop, stop!

121
00:12:50,997 --> 00:12:52,357
Stop!

122
00:12:55,438 --> 00:12:56,957
That's a good boy. Come on.

123
00:12:57,231 --> 00:12:58,154
Come on!

124
00:13:00,512 --> 00:13:01,996
No, no, no, stop!

125
00:13:22,332 --> 00:13:23,829
Guess that means you're unarmed.

126
00:13:25,251 --> 00:13:26,648
Don't! Put that down!

127
00:13:46,572 --> 00:13:47,321
Podrick?

128
00:13:48,381 --> 00:13:49,354
Yes, my Lady?

129
00:13:50,103 --> 00:13:51,325
You can stand now.

130
00:13:52,025 --> 00:13:52,924
Yes, my Lady.

131
00:13:57,439 --> 00:13:58,524
Sansa Stark?

132
00:13:59,784 --> 00:14:01,780
Wary of strangers, as she should be.

133
00:14:02,192 --> 00:14:04,662
I saw her riding on the
Eastroad with Littlefinger.

134
00:14:05,023 --> 00:14:06,820
- We'll follow them.
- My Lady...

135
00:14:07,531 --> 00:14:09,751
if both Stark girls refused your service,

136
00:14:10,524 --> 00:14:12,034
maybe you're released from your vow.

137
00:14:12,433 --> 00:14:14,495
I swore to their mother
I would protect those girls.

138
00:14:14,615 --> 00:14:15,895
They don't want your protection.

139
00:14:15,925 --> 00:14:17,486
You think she's safe with Littlefinger?

140
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:21,381
No, my Lady.

141
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,115
Get your horse.

142
00:14:32,929 --> 00:14:34,488
A summons from the Queen.

143
00:14:53,203 --> 00:14:55,161
There are only two like it in the world.

144
00:14:56,409 --> 00:14:58,766
The one I'm wearing and the
one I gave to Myrcella.

145
00:14:59,256 --> 00:15:00,217
It's a threat.

146
00:15:00,337 --> 00:15:01,926
Of course it's a threat.

147
00:15:02,637 --> 00:15:06,964
Our daughter is alone in Dorne surrounded
by people who hate our family.

148
00:15:07,991 --> 00:15:10,199
It's a threat,

149
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:12,613
No note?

150
00:15:12,733 --> 00:15:15,560
They blame us for the death
of Oberyn and his sister.

151
00:15:15,877 --> 00:15:17,460
And every other tragedy that

152
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,163
has befallen their accursed country.

153
00:15:19,283 --> 00:15:21,708
I will burn their cities to
the ground if they touch her.

154
00:15:21,828 --> 00:15:22,656
Softer.

155
00:15:22,776 --> 00:15:23,489
What?

156
00:15:23,609 --> 00:15:24,537
Not so loud.

157
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:27,756
Our daughter is in danger and you're worried
I am speaking too loudly?

158
00:15:27,876 --> 00:15:29,749
No one can know she's our daughter.

159
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,385
Then don't call her your daughter.

160
00:15:33,674 --> 00:15:35,371
You've never been a father to her.

161
00:15:35,491 --> 00:15:37,990
If I was a father to any of my children,
they'd be stoned in the streets.

162
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:39,512
And what has your caution brought?

163
00:15:41,438 --> 00:15:43,821
Our eldest child murdered
at his own wedding,

164
00:15:44,369 --> 00:15:46,715
our only daughter shipped off to Dorne,

165
00:15:48,067 --> 00:15:52,221
our baby boy set to marry that
smirking whore from Highgarden!

166
00:16:01,382 --> 00:16:02,629
I'm gonna make things better.

167
00:16:02,749 --> 00:16:04,110
You've never made anything better.

168
00:16:04,207 --> 00:16:05,376
I'm going to Dorne.

169
00:16:05,876 --> 00:16:07,473
And I'm bringing our daughter home.

170
00:16:08,408 --> 00:16:12,038
You can't just ask Prince
Doran to give her back.

171
00:16:12,506 --> 00:16:14,314
She's promised to his son.

172
00:16:14,551 --> 00:16:16,223
I'm not going to ask him anything.

173
00:16:17,046 --> 00:16:19,173
You go down there with an army
it's an act of war.

174
00:16:19,293 --> 00:16:20,146
No army.

175
00:16:20,907 --> 00:16:22,503
Do you know where they're keeping her?

176
00:16:26,033 --> 00:16:28,029
Oberyn mentioned the Water Gardens.

177
00:16:28,453 --> 00:16:29,389
I'll find her.

178
00:16:32,688 --> 00:16:34,222
Is there anything else, Your Grace?

179
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:39,143
You're going to Dorne.

180
00:16:40,365 --> 00:16:42,149
A one-handed man.

181
00:16:42,922 --> 00:16:44,157
Alone.

182
00:16:45,148 --> 00:16:47,019
Who said I was going alone?

183
00:16:55,328 --> 00:16:57,686
No sunflowers. I don't like yellow.

184
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:00,118
Roses are very nice,
definitely roses.

185
00:17:00,238 --> 00:17:01,950
And music. I adore music.

186
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:03,272
But no flutes.

187
00:17:03,392 --> 00:17:06,203
I hate flutes. We can have a harp,
if you like, but no flutes.

188
00:17:06,323 --> 00:17:07,203
Then there's the food.

189
00:17:07,231 --> 00:17:09,456
The food is the most important thing,
don't you agree?

190
00:17:09,576 --> 00:17:11,165
We're gonna need pigeon pies.

191
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:13,763
That's what they eat in the capital,
don't they?

192
00:17:14,561 --> 00:17:16,170
Don't they?

193
00:17:17,935 --> 00:17:18,833
Don't who?

194
00:17:19,057 --> 00:17:22,332
People eat pigeon pie in the capital.

195
00:17:23,018 --> 00:17:24,777
They certainly do, my dear.

196
00:17:25,007 --> 00:17:26,379
They certainly do.

197
00:17:27,365 --> 00:17:29,174
It's a fine place, isn't it?

198
00:17:29,928 --> 00:17:31,500
A fine place.

199
00:17:32,061 --> 00:17:35,685
I never thought I'd end up settling down
in a place like this.

200
00:17:36,308 --> 00:17:37,294
You won't.

201
00:17:38,947 --> 00:17:39,620
Pardon?

202
00:17:39,857 --> 00:17:41,741
We won't get to live at Stokeworth.

203
00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:44,803
When mother dies, my sister gets the castle
because she's older.

204
00:17:45,127 --> 00:17:46,799
She hates me.

205
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:48,399
She calls me mean names and sometimes

206
00:17:48,503 --> 00:17:51,252
even still she pulls my hair
when mother's not looking.

207
00:17:53,457 --> 00:17:54,729
You know what I think?

208
00:17:55,503 --> 00:17:57,174
I think you're a good person.

209
00:17:57,798 --> 00:17:59,968
And your sister is a mean person.

210
00:18:00,088 --> 00:18:00,979
She is.

211
00:18:03,598 --> 00:18:04,883
I've been all over the world

212
00:18:05,263 --> 00:18:06,897
and if there's one thing I've learned,

213
00:18:07,483 --> 00:18:09,429
is that meanness comes around.

214
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:11,911
People like your sister,

215
00:18:12,622 --> 00:18:15,110
they always get what's coming for them,
eventually.

216
00:18:15,909 --> 00:18:17,593
One way or another.

217
00:18:21,117 --> 00:18:22,227
Who's that?

218
00:18:25,601 --> 00:18:27,235
Jaime fucking Lannister.

219
00:18:29,661 --> 00:18:30,485
Ser Jaime?

220
00:18:30,605 --> 00:18:31,882
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.

221
00:18:33,688 --> 00:18:35,796
I was very sorry to hear about your father.

222
00:18:36,251 --> 00:18:37,000
Thank you.

223
00:18:37,923 --> 00:18:40,280
This is my betrothed, Lollys.

224
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,342
A pleasure.

225
00:18:46,373 --> 00:18:47,434
Run along, love.

226
00:18:54,322 --> 00:18:56,381
Beautiful young bride you've chosen.

227
00:18:57,092 --> 00:18:58,732
When are you planning on getting married?

228
00:18:58,863 --> 00:18:59,824
Just get on with it.

229
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:01,009
On with what?

230
00:19:01,129 --> 00:19:02,268
What you're here for.

231
00:19:02,701 --> 00:19:05,869
There's no way this little visit
could possibly mean anything good for me.

232
00:19:05,989 --> 00:19:07,117
It's very good for you.

233
00:19:19,788 --> 00:19:22,282
Lollys will be marrying Ser Willys Bracken.

234
00:19:22,507 --> 00:19:23,619
Mmm.

235
00:19:23,984 --> 00:19:26,225
We've made a deal, your sister and I.

236
00:19:26,567 --> 00:19:28,248
I would have advised against that.

237
00:19:28,368 --> 00:19:29,466
How is this good for me?

238
00:19:29,586 --> 00:19:32,506
Because you're going to come with me
and help me with something important.

239
00:19:32,536 --> 00:19:34,046
And when we return...

240
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:37,896
I'm gonna give you a much better girl
and a much better castle.

241
00:19:40,478 --> 00:19:42,403
Return from where?

242
00:19:42,861 --> 00:19:45,324
As far south as south goes.

243
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:11,598
<i>You are my queen.</i>

244
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,596
The prince does not
wish to be disturbed.

245
00:20:22,793 --> 00:20:24,231
Remove yourself from my path

246
00:20:24,266 --> 00:20:26,301
or I'll take that long axe
and I'll shove it up your...

247
00:20:26,336 --> 00:20:27,425
<i>Captain...</i>

248
00:20:29,335 --> 00:20:30,671
let her pass.

249
00:20:35,118 --> 00:20:36,697
Your brother was murdered...

250
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:39,578
and you sit here
in the Water Gardens

251
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:41,913
staring at the sky
and doing nothing.

252
00:20:41,948 --> 00:20:44,483
Oberyn was slain
during a trial by combat

253
00:20:44,485 --> 00:20:46,196
by law, that is no murder.

254
00:20:46,198 --> 00:20:48,822
- Your brother...
- You don't have to remind me.

255
00:20:48,857 --> 00:20:52,063
He was my brother long
before he was anything to you.

256
00:20:52,446 --> 00:20:53,645
What will you know about his death?

257
00:20:53,647 --> 00:20:56,368
I will bury him.
I will mourn for him.

258
00:20:56,403 --> 00:20:57,418
And then?

259
00:20:57,453 --> 00:20:58,731
You would have me go to war.

260
00:20:58,733 --> 00:21:00,476
The whole country
would have you go to war.

261
00:21:00,511 --> 00:21:03,652
Then we are lucky
the whole country does not decide.

262
00:21:05,786 --> 00:21:07,653
The Sand Snakes are with me.

263
00:21:07,688 --> 00:21:09,272
They have the love of their people.

264
00:21:09,307 --> 00:21:10,525
They will avenge their father

265
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:14,496
while you sit here
in your chair doing nothing.

266
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:20,525
Oberyn is dead.

267
00:21:21,384 --> 00:21:24,311
And this Lannister girl
skips about the Water Gardens

268
00:21:24,313 --> 00:21:27,636
eating our food,
breathing our air.

269
00:21:28,725 --> 00:21:30,197
How many of your
brothers and sisters

270
00:21:30,199 --> 00:21:31,883
do they have to kill?

271
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,376
<i>Let me have her.</i>

272
00:21:36,303 --> 00:21:40,406
Let me send her to Cersei
one finger at a time.

273
00:21:41,703 --> 00:21:43,794
I loved my brother.

274
00:21:43,829 --> 00:21:46,064
And you made him very happy.

275
00:21:46,099 --> 00:21:48,981
For that, you will always
have a place in my heart.

276
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:54,678
But we do not mutilate
little girls for vengeance.

277
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:56,297
Not here.

278
00:21:56,332 --> 00:21:58,332
Not while I rule.

279
00:21:59,426 --> 00:22:01,125
And how long would that be?

280
00:22:17,445 --> 00:22:19,644
The Unsullied are too conspicuous.

281
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,374
Anyone can see them coming from a mile off.

282
00:22:22,945 --> 00:22:25,017
'Course you haven't found any
Sons of the Harpy.

283
00:22:25,547 --> 00:22:26,942
You haven't, have you?

284
00:22:29,104 --> 00:22:31,545
My Second Sons
on the other hand...

285
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:36,476
they drink, they whore,
fight in streets,

286
00:22:36,978 --> 00:22:38,222
they blend in.

287
00:22:38,257 --> 00:22:40,557
They overhear things in taverns.

288
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:44,140
Follow people from the taverns
to nice quiet alleys.

289
00:22:44,572 --> 00:22:48,646
Break a few fingers,
overhear a few more things...

290
00:22:49,967 --> 00:22:51,369
before you know it...

291
00:23:11,179 --> 00:23:12,616
No one here.

292
00:23:13,546 --> 00:23:14,714
We go.

293
00:23:14,949 --> 00:23:16,517
In a hurry?

294
00:23:16,552 --> 00:23:17,494
You're afraid?

295
00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:19,977
Unsullied fear nothing.

296
00:23:20,597 --> 00:23:22,163
Right.

297
00:23:22,264 --> 00:23:23,675
That's your problem.

298
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:27,973
You understood fear once, long ago,
but you forgot what it means.

299
00:23:28,815 --> 00:23:30,829
Someone who's forgotten fear...

300
00:23:31,346 --> 00:23:33,318
has forgotten how to hide.

301
00:23:42,113 --> 00:23:44,068
Fear is useful that way.

302
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,023
Sons of the Harpy...

303
00:24:10,058 --> 00:24:12,345
they want to put a collar
back on my neck.

304
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:14,780
On all of our necks.
Please, Your Grace...

305
00:24:14,815 --> 00:24:17,215
- <i>you must kill him.</i>
- It would send a message.

306
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:19,350
I think you should
exercise restraint...

307
00:24:19,385 --> 00:24:20,528
- <i>Your Grace.</i>
- Why?

308
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:22,650
Well, for one thing, he
may have valuable information.

309
00:24:22,672 --> 00:24:25,840
Well, the Son of the Harpy
has no more valuable information.

310
00:24:25,875 --> 00:24:27,016
How do you know that?

311
00:24:27,051 --> 00:24:28,754
Because I questioned him.

312
00:24:29,265 --> 00:24:31,749
And the information you did get...
he is young and..

313
00:24:31,784 --> 00:24:32,888
He is born free.

314
00:24:32,923 --> 00:24:34,102
Why should he want
to bring back slavery?

315
00:24:34,137 --> 00:24:35,173
What did it do for him?

316
00:24:35,208 --> 00:24:36,673
Perhaps the only thing
that gave him pride

317
00:24:36,793 --> 00:24:38,529
was knowing that there was
someone lower than he was.

318
00:24:38,564 --> 00:24:39,897
<i>They pay him.</i>

319
00:24:39,932 --> 00:24:42,132
Great families, afraid to do a thing.

320
00:24:42,167 --> 00:24:43,422
They pay poor men
to do it for them.

321
00:24:43,457 --> 00:24:44,535
And how do you know this?

322
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:46,270
- <i>Everyone know this.</i>
- I don't know it.

323
00:24:46,305 --> 00:24:47,472
<i>And I'm the head of a great family.</i>

324
00:24:47,507 --> 00:24:50,041
<i>We do not know what
this man did or didn't do.</i>

325
00:24:50,076 --> 00:24:52,276
Give him a trial at least.

326
00:24:52,311 --> 00:24:53,797
A fair trial.

327
00:24:54,446 --> 00:24:55,783
Show all the citizens of Meereen

328
00:24:55,818 --> 00:24:58,342
that you are better than those
who would depose you.

329
00:24:58,577 --> 00:24:59,769
Teach them a better way.

330
00:24:59,804 --> 00:25:02,365
I do not know the place
from where old ser comes.

331
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,211
Things maybe are different there, I hope.

332
00:25:05,702 --> 00:25:08,883
But here, in Meereen,
before Daenerys Stormborn

333
00:25:08,918 --> 00:25:10,450
they own us.

334
00:25:10,746 --> 00:25:12,689
So we learn much about them...

335
00:25:13,124 --> 00:25:14,869
or we do not live long.

336
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,225
They teach me what they are.

337
00:25:17,692 --> 00:25:19,901
Mercy, fair trial...

338
00:25:19,936 --> 00:25:21,936
these mean nothing to them.

339
00:25:21,971 --> 00:25:23,971
All they understand is blood.

340
00:25:29,307 --> 00:25:30,810
Thank you all for your counsel.

341
00:25:39,888 --> 00:25:40,828
<i>Your Grace...</i>

342
00:25:40,863 --> 00:25:42,463
a word, please, I beg you.

343
00:25:42,498 --> 00:25:43,522
About what?

344
00:25:43,557 --> 00:25:45,185
About your father.

345
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:47,220
- About the Mad King.
- The Mad King?

346
00:25:47,255 --> 00:25:48,887
You're here to remind me
of my enemies' lies?

347
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:50,149
Consider me reminded.

348
00:25:50,184 --> 00:25:52,083
Your Grace...

349
00:25:52,118 --> 00:25:53,914
I served in his Kingsguard.

350
00:25:54,583 --> 00:25:56,640
I was at his side
from the first.

351
00:25:56,675 --> 00:25:58,875
Your enemies did not lie.

352
00:26:00,493 --> 00:26:01,715
Go on.

353
00:26:03,722 --> 00:26:06,546
When the people rose
in revolt against him

354
00:26:06,581 --> 00:26:09,077
your father set their towns and castles aflame.

355
00:26:10,153 --> 00:26:12,663
He murdered sons
in front of their fathers.

356
00:26:13,492 --> 00:26:15,772
He burned men alive
with wildfire

357
00:26:15,807 --> 00:26:17,707
and laughed as they screamed,

358
00:26:18,863 --> 00:26:21,194
and his efforts to stamp out dissent

359
00:26:22,412 --> 00:26:24,964
led to rebellion
that killed every Targaryen...

360
00:26:25,449 --> 00:26:26,845
except two.

361
00:26:27,892 --> 00:26:29,455
I'm not my father.

362
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:32,028
No, Your Grace, thank the gods.

363
00:26:33,052 --> 00:26:37,154
But the Mad King gave his enemies
the justice he thought they deserved.

364
00:26:37,189 --> 00:26:40,069
And each time,
it made him feel powerful...

365
00:26:40,104 --> 00:26:41,378
and right...

366
00:26:42,254 --> 00:26:43,737
until the very end.

367
00:26:48,692 --> 00:26:52,167
I will not have the Son of the Harpy
executed without a fair trial.

368
00:26:55,993 --> 00:26:57,458
Your Grace.

369
00:27:07,344 --> 00:27:08,723
There's a bug.

370
00:27:08,758 --> 00:27:10,232
Yes, best be careful.

371
00:27:10,267 --> 00:27:13,056
You might accidentally
consume some solid food.

372
00:27:13,091 --> 00:27:17,785
When I agreed to come with you,
did I misrepresent my intentions?

373
00:27:22,094 --> 00:27:27,361
Besides, what else is there for me
to do inside this fucking box?

374
00:27:27,396 --> 00:27:29,296
- You don't like it?
- I want to take a walk.

375
00:27:29,331 --> 00:27:30,500
You can't.

376
00:27:30,535 --> 00:27:33,732
Cersei has offered a lordship
to the man who brings her your head.

377
00:27:33,767 --> 00:27:36,167
She ought to offer her cunt.

378
00:27:36,202 --> 00:27:38,502
Best part of her
for the best part of me.

379
00:27:39,153 --> 00:27:42,452
Well, I suppose a box is as good
a place for me as anywhere.

380
00:27:43,176 --> 00:27:45,780
Are we really going to
spend the entire road to Volantis

381
00:27:45,815 --> 00:27:47,915
talking about the
futility of everything.

382
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:49,845
You're right, there's no point.

383
00:27:50,236 --> 00:27:52,321
The road to Volantis?

384
00:27:52,323 --> 00:27:55,231
You said we are going to Meereen.
What's in Volantis?

385
00:27:55,266 --> 00:27:56,642
The road to Meereen.

386
00:27:56,677 --> 00:28:00,461
And what do you hope to find
at the end of the road to Meereen?

387
00:28:00,496 --> 00:28:02,496
I told you.
A ruler.

388
00:28:02,531 --> 00:28:04,731
But you've already got a ruler.

389
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:07,421
Everywhere has already got a ruler.

390
00:28:07,456 --> 00:28:09,996
Every pile of shit
on the side of every road

391
00:28:10,031 --> 00:28:12,131
has someone's banner
hanging from it.

392
00:28:12,166 --> 00:28:13,953
You are quite good, do you know?

393
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,906
At ruling.

394
00:28:16,521 --> 00:28:18,696
During your brief tenure as Hand.

395
00:28:19,171 --> 00:28:20,631
I didn't rule, I was a servant.

396
00:28:20,666 --> 00:28:23,183
Still, a man of talent.

397
00:28:23,218 --> 00:28:24,789
Managed to kill a lot of people?

398
00:28:24,824 --> 00:28:28,971
Yes, but you showed great
promise in other areas as well.

399
00:28:32,122 --> 00:28:34,387
She wanted me
to leave King's Landing.

400
00:28:35,397 --> 00:28:36,529
She begged me.

401
00:28:37,262 --> 00:28:38,709
I wouldn't go.

402
00:28:38,744 --> 00:28:39,899
Why?

403
00:28:39,934 --> 00:28:41,409
'Cause I liked it.

404
00:28:42,692 --> 00:28:44,503
Power...

405
00:28:44,538 --> 00:28:46,004
even as a servant.

406
00:28:46,513 --> 00:28:49,494
People follow leaders

407
00:28:49,529 --> 00:28:51,242
and they will never follow us.

408
00:28:51,277 --> 00:28:53,277
They find us repulsive.

409
00:28:53,312 --> 00:28:54,542
I find us repulsive.

410
00:28:54,577 --> 00:28:56,948
And we find them...
repulsive, which is why

411
00:28:56,983 --> 00:28:59,841
we surround ourselves
with large comfortable boxes

412
00:28:59,843 --> 00:29:01,320
to keep them away.

413
00:29:02,149 --> 00:29:03,375
And yet...

414
00:29:04,243 --> 00:29:05,817
no matter what we do...

415
00:29:06,421 --> 00:29:10,922
people like you and me are never
really satisfied inside the box.

416
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:12,241
Not for long.

417
00:29:13,746 --> 00:29:14,874
You're right.

418
00:29:15,644 --> 00:29:17,947
- Let's go for a walk.
- No.

419
00:29:17,982 --> 00:29:20,521
How many dwarves
are there in the world?

420
00:29:21,212 --> 00:29:23,175
Is Cersei
going to kill them all?

421
00:29:27,961 --> 00:29:29,646
Not him.

422
00:29:29,681 --> 00:29:31,981
You're trying
to deceive your queen?

423
00:29:32,016 --> 00:29:34,116
Should I throw them
in a cell, Your Grace?

424
00:29:34,151 --> 00:29:35,791
It won't be necessary,
Ser Meryn.

425
00:29:35,826 --> 00:29:38,272
I don't want to dissuade
the other hunters.

426
00:29:38,766 --> 00:29:40,470
Mistakes will be made.

427
00:29:40,505 --> 00:29:41,269
- Thank you, Your Grace.
- Thanks.

428
00:29:41,271 --> 00:29:42,125
- Thank you, Your Grace.
- Thank you.

429
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,120
Take the head.

430
00:29:43,155 --> 00:29:44,027
Let me, Your Grace.

431
00:29:44,062 --> 00:29:46,062
I would take it
if you don't mind.

432
00:29:46,097 --> 00:29:48,097
It could prove
useful for my work.

433
00:29:49,391 --> 00:29:50,532
Very good.

434
00:29:53,654 --> 00:29:55,231
Over there would be fine.

435
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,776
You heard the man, over there.

436
00:30:26,943 --> 00:30:28,490
You're the hand of the King.

437
00:30:28,525 --> 00:30:29,978
No, uncle.

438
00:30:30,013 --> 00:30:33,483
Clearly, it would not be appropriate
for a woman to assume that role.

439
00:30:33,751 --> 00:30:37,930
I'm merely advising my son until he comes
of age and chooses a Hand for himself.

440
00:30:38,165 --> 00:30:42,037
Your Grace, I would be willing
to serve provisionally as the King's Hand

441
00:30:42,072 --> 00:30:44,701
- until he becomes full...
- You're a good man, Lord Tyrell,

442
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:46,936
but I don't imagine
we'll have the time.

443
00:30:46,971 --> 00:30:49,186
In addition to be Master of Ships,

444
00:30:49,221 --> 00:30:52,137
the King has appointed
you Master of Coin.

445
00:30:53,474 --> 00:30:54,396
Oh, Your Grace.

446
00:30:54,431 --> 00:30:58,503
He called your experience and wisdom
in financial matters unparalleled.

447
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:02,962
He said he would be honored to have you
represent the Crown's interest in the same.

448
00:31:02,997 --> 00:31:05,097
The honor is all mine,
Your Grace.

449
00:31:05,132 --> 00:31:08,299
<i>Y-Y-Your Grace,
in the past, on several occasions,</i>

450
00:31:08,334 --> 00:31:10,991
a Grand Maester has
served as the King's Hand.

451
00:31:11,026 --> 00:31:15,490
The King's named Qyburn
the new Master of Whispers.

452
00:31:17,394 --> 00:31:18,921
Your Grace,

453
00:31:18,956 --> 00:31:23,321
this-this man?
Th-This embarassment to the Citadel?

454
00:31:23,748 --> 00:31:24,956
Your Grace...

455
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:28,871
what qualifications can he
possibly have for this post?

456
00:31:28,906 --> 00:31:31,487
The qualification of loyalty,
Grand Maester.

457
00:31:31,522 --> 00:31:33,622
That's far more than
the eunuch ever had.

458
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:36,212
Far more than many ever have.

459
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:38,763
I must say...
I can not...

460
00:31:38,798 --> 00:31:40,037
Uncle Kevan,

461
00:31:40,072 --> 00:31:43,313
in light of your position as
Commander of the Lannister Armies,

462
00:31:43,348 --> 00:31:46,750
it would please the King if you
would serve as his Master of War.

463
00:31:47,003 --> 00:31:49,696
No man living
better deserves the title.

464
00:31:50,277 --> 00:31:51,795
That is kind of you to say.

465
00:31:52,437 --> 00:31:54,702
I would like to hear it
from the King himself.

466
00:31:54,837 --> 00:31:56,302
Well, the King is very
busy at this moment.

467
00:31:56,337 --> 00:31:58,871
He should be here,
learning what it means to rule.

468
00:31:58,906 --> 00:32:00,375
He is learning.

469
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:02,527
On this occasion,
in his capacity as ruler,

470
00:32:02,562 --> 00:32:04,562
he's asked me
to speak on his behalf.

471
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:09,005
I returned to the capital
to pay my respects to my brother,

472
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,119
and to you,

473
00:32:10,154 --> 00:32:11,910
and to serve the King.

474
00:32:11,945 --> 00:32:15,465
I did not return to the capital
to serve as your puppet.

475
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:19,006
To watch you stack the
Small Council with sycophants.

476
00:32:20,015 --> 00:32:21,525
Sending your own brother away...

477
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:25,506
My brother has left the capital
to lead a sensitive diplomatic mission.

478
00:32:25,541 --> 00:32:26,575
<i>What mission?</i>

479
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:28,934
That is not your concern
as Master of War.

480
00:32:31,071 --> 00:32:33,560
I do not recognize
your authority to dictate

481
00:32:33,595 --> 00:32:36,098
what is and is not my concern.

482
00:32:36,444 --> 00:32:38,133
You are the Queen Mother.

483
00:32:38,868 --> 00:32:40,419
Nothing more.

484
00:32:43,606 --> 00:32:46,380
You would abandon your king
in his time of need?

485
00:32:46,415 --> 00:32:49,751
If he wants to send for me,
I'll be waiting for him.

486
00:32:49,786 --> 00:32:51,886
At Casterly Rock.

487
00:32:59,194 --> 00:33:01,428
Come on, you know this one.

488
00:33:03,202 --> 00:33:04,571
It looks like an animal.

489
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:09,050
Snake.

490
00:33:09,489 --> 00:33:11,971
S-S-Sn...
"S".

491
00:33:12,006 --> 00:33:14,400
- It's an "S".
- <i>Right, very good.</i>

492
00:33:14,435 --> 00:33:17,111
Hmm, did you know

493
00:33:17,146 --> 00:33:18,866
that the youngest
Lord Commander in history,

494
00:33:18,881 --> 00:33:21,418
Osric Stark,
was elected at the age of 10?

495
00:33:23,426 --> 00:33:25,302
I know "S".

496
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:27,022
You'll learn, I promise.

497
00:33:27,142 --> 00:33:27,766
I taught Ser Davos.

498
00:33:27,768 --> 00:33:30,046
Old people are terrible
at learning new things.

499
00:33:30,081 --> 00:33:32,235
Well, you are a wonderful teacher.

500
00:33:33,754 --> 00:33:34,965
Very patient.

501
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,907
I only said that the more
time that you spend practicing

502
00:33:37,942 --> 00:33:39,007
<i>the faster you will
be able to read.</i>

503
00:33:39,042 --> 00:33:40,455
That's all right.

504
00:33:40,778 --> 00:33:42,109
We're doing just fine.

505
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:46,491
I'm sure you and Ostrich Stark
have a lot to talk about.

506
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:51,868
How old were you
when you learned how to read?

507
00:33:51,903 --> 00:33:53,502
- <i>3.</i>
- 3?

508
00:33:53,537 --> 00:33:55,036
Were you taught by your mother?

509
00:33:55,747 --> 00:33:56,826
No.

510
00:33:56,861 --> 00:33:58,761
Our Maester Cressen did.

511
00:33:58,796 --> 00:34:02,230
I had a lot of time to practice.
My mother kept me inside because...

512
00:34:04,978 --> 00:34:09,083
What do you call it in the south?
What happened to your face.

513
00:34:09,118 --> 00:34:11,077
Grayscale.

514
00:34:11,112 --> 00:34:12,992
What would you call it
in the north of the Wall?

515
00:34:13,658 --> 00:34:15,072
I don't know.

516
00:34:15,816 --> 00:34:19,142
But two of my sisters had it.
They both died.

517
00:34:19,403 --> 00:34:20,878
How did they cure you?

518
00:34:20,913 --> 00:34:23,498
I don't remember.
I was a baby.

519
00:34:23,718 --> 00:34:25,935
A lot of people came and tried, I think.

520
00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:28,273
Whatever they did, it went away.

521
00:34:30,085 --> 00:34:31,715
What happened to your sisters?

522
00:34:33,998 --> 00:34:38,112
My father made them move out
to the keep, outside.

523
00:34:38,801 --> 00:34:40,735
None of us were allowed
to go near them.

524
00:34:41,105 --> 00:34:45,127
But we heard them,
especially at night.

525
00:34:45,669 --> 00:34:50,023
They started to sound
not like themselves.

526
00:34:50,658 --> 00:34:52,027
Did you ever see them?

527
00:34:53,170 --> 00:34:54,802
Only once, at the end.

528
00:34:56,752 --> 00:34:58,138
They were covered with it.

529
00:34:59,377 --> 00:35:04,624
Their faces, their arms,
they acted like animals.

530
00:35:05,925 --> 00:35:08,843
My father had to drag them out
to the woods on a rope.

531
00:35:09,743 --> 00:35:11,545
What did he do with
them in the woods?

532
00:35:17,283 --> 00:35:18,324
Mother.

533
00:35:18,854 --> 00:35:20,130
Leave us.

534
00:35:23,344 --> 00:35:24,535
Your Grace.

535
00:35:26,353 --> 00:35:27,923
You need to stay
away from that girl.

536
00:35:27,958 --> 00:35:29,476
- Why?
- She's a wildling.

537
00:35:29,511 --> 00:35:30,757
Her name's Gilly.

538
00:35:30,792 --> 00:35:32,592
She's nice.
I'm teaching her to read.

539
00:35:32,627 --> 00:35:35,880
She's a wildling.
Your father defeated her people.

540
00:35:35,915 --> 00:35:38,532
He executed their king
for treason.

541
00:35:38,824 --> 00:35:41,803
They could strike at him
by striking at you.

542
00:35:41,838 --> 00:35:43,509
Gilly wouldn't do that.

543
00:35:45,073 --> 00:35:47,231
You have no idea
what people will do.

544
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:50,562
All your books
and you still don't know.

545
00:35:56,661 --> 00:35:59,355
I ordered Mance Rayder
burned at the stake.

546
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:01,690
You prevented that order
from being carried out.

547
00:36:01,725 --> 00:36:04,225
You showed mercy
to Mance Rayder.

548
00:36:04,387 --> 00:36:06,050
The King's word is law.

549
00:36:06,857 --> 00:36:10,698
Perhaps you should ask Ser Davos
how much mercy I show to lawbreakers.

550
00:36:14,433 --> 00:36:16,426
Show too much kindness,
people won't fear you.

551
00:36:16,461 --> 00:36:18,561
If they don't fear you,
they don't follow you.

552
00:36:19,384 --> 00:36:21,784
With respect, Your Grace,
the Free Folk will never follow you

553
00:36:21,788 --> 00:36:23,124
no matter what you do.

554
00:36:24,321 --> 00:36:26,299
You're the man
who burned their king alive.

555
00:36:26,888 --> 00:36:28,134
Who then?

556
00:36:30,208 --> 00:36:31,578
You?

557
00:36:31,613 --> 00:36:34,803
No.
Only one of their own.

558
00:36:37,022 --> 00:36:38,538
Do you know this wretched girl?

559
00:36:40,098 --> 00:36:42,639
- Lyanna Mormont.
- Lord Commander's niece.

560
00:36:43,033 --> 00:36:44,498
Lady of Bear Island.

561
00:36:44,868 --> 00:36:46,455
And a child of ten.

562
00:36:48,028 --> 00:36:50,904
I asked her to commit her house
to my court. That's her response.

563
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:54,333
Bear Island knows no king
but the King in the North,

564
00:36:54,368 --> 00:36:56,353
whose name is Stark.

565
00:36:56,702 --> 00:36:58,551
That amuses you.

566
00:37:00,133 --> 00:37:01,893
I apologize, Your Grace.

567
00:37:02,989 --> 00:37:06,532
Northerners commit
a bit like the Free Folk.

568
00:37:07,474 --> 00:37:08,969
Loyal to their own.

569
00:37:09,386 --> 00:37:10,500
I know.

570
00:37:10,535 --> 00:37:13,702
My brother, Robert, went on often
and loudly about how difficult it was

571
00:37:13,737 --> 00:37:15,233
to control them.

572
00:37:17,256 --> 00:37:19,253
Even with your father's help.

573
00:37:22,024 --> 00:37:25,231
Tonight, the Night's Watch
elect a new Lord Commander.

574
00:37:26,109 --> 00:37:27,844
Ser Alliser Thorne
is going to win.

575
00:37:27,879 --> 00:37:29,898
- Most likely.
- One pleasant man.

576
00:37:30,334 --> 00:37:31,892
He thinks you're a traitor.

577
00:37:33,079 --> 00:37:34,594
What's your life gonna
be like here at the Wall,

578
00:37:34,629 --> 00:37:37,439
- with Thorne in command?
- Unpleasant, I expect.

579
00:37:37,474 --> 00:37:39,276
Your bravery made him look weak.

580
00:37:40,753 --> 00:37:42,196
He'll punish you for it.

581
00:37:42,484 --> 00:37:44,406
I don't punish men for bravery.

582
00:37:44,441 --> 00:37:45,935
I reward them.

583
00:37:46,355 --> 00:37:48,070
I don't doubt that, Your Grace.

584
00:37:49,318 --> 00:37:51,071
But I am a brother
of the Night's Watch.

585
00:37:51,408 --> 00:37:54,021
I have pledged them my life,
my honor, my sword.

586
00:37:54,256 --> 00:37:56,156
I don't know what
I have left to give you.

587
00:37:56,191 --> 00:37:57,970
You can give me the North.

588
00:37:59,405 --> 00:38:00,523
I can't.

589
00:38:02,151 --> 00:38:04,370
Even if I wanted to,
I'm a bastard.

590
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:05,823
A Snow.

591
00:38:06,368 --> 00:38:08,983
Kneel before me.
Lay your sword at my feet.

592
00:38:09,018 --> 00:38:11,882
Pledge me your service
and you'll rise again as Jon Stark,

593
00:38:11,917 --> 00:38:13,432
Lord of Winterfell.

594
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:21,619
He'll make you a Stark
with a stroke of a pen.

595
00:38:22,083 --> 00:38:24,272
It's the first thing
I ever remember wanting.

596
00:38:25,704 --> 00:38:28,511
I daydreamed that my father
would ask the king.

597
00:38:28,546 --> 00:38:30,944
Just like that I would never be
the Bastard of Winterfell again.

598
00:38:30,979 --> 00:38:33,979
No, you deserve that.
You do.

599
00:38:34,014 --> 00:38:36,173
I-I couldn't be happier for you.

600
00:38:37,194 --> 00:38:38,736
I'm gonna refuse him.

601
00:38:40,769 --> 00:38:42,008
But...

602
00:38:42,043 --> 00:38:44,038
you'd be Lord of Winterfell.

603
00:38:44,658 --> 00:38:46,839
I swore a vow
to the Night's Watch.

604
00:38:47,042 --> 00:38:48,645
If I don't take
my own word seriously,

605
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:50,880
what sort of Lord of Winterfell
would that be?

606
00:38:54,621 --> 00:38:55,576
<i>Hey.</i>

607
00:38:56,068 --> 00:38:59,253
Crowded,
You'd think we were serving venison stew.

608
00:39:06,225 --> 00:39:10,670
Does anyone wish to speak
for candidates...

609
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:13,379
before we cast our tokens...

610
00:39:13,756 --> 00:39:19,879
for the 998th Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch?

611
00:39:22,278 --> 00:39:24,086
Ser Alliser Thorne
is not just a knight,

612
00:39:24,121 --> 00:39:25,973
he's a man of true nobility.

613
00:39:26,008 --> 00:39:29,126
<i>He was Acting Commander
when the Wall came under attack</i>

614
00:39:29,161 --> 00:39:30,661
and led us to victory
against the wildlings.

615
00:39:30,696 --> 00:39:31,646
<i>Yes.</i>

616
00:39:31,681 --> 00:39:33,135
He's a veteran of 100 battles

617
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:36,552
and has been a defender of the Watch
and the Wall almost all of his life.

618
00:39:36,587 --> 00:39:37,751
<i>Nice.</i>

619
00:39:38,398 --> 00:39:40,204
- He's the only true choice.
- <i>Yes.</i>

620
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:42,152
<i>Yes.</i>

621
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:47,288
Ser Denys Mallister
joined the Watch as a boy

622
00:39:47,323 --> 00:39:50,444
and has served loyally
longer than any other Ranger.

623
00:39:50,479 --> 00:39:53,009
- <i>That's right.</i>
- Through ten winters he served.

624
00:39:53,083 --> 00:39:54,970
As Commander of the Shadow Tower...

625
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:57,004
he kept the wildlings away.

626
00:39:57,124 --> 00:39:58,739
We could do no better.

627
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:04,645
If there's no one else...

628
00:40:04,765 --> 00:40:06,624
we will begin the voting.

629
00:40:07,072 --> 00:40:11,574
The triangular tokens count
for Ser Alliser Thorne.

630
00:40:11,886 --> 00:40:15,745
The square tokens for Ser Denys Mallister.

631
00:40:16,174 --> 00:40:18,221
Maester Aemon...

632
00:40:19,838 --> 00:40:23,045
Samwell Tarly, go on.

633
00:40:24,081 --> 00:40:25,540
Sam the Slayer.

634
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:30,174
Another wildling lover,
just like his friend, Jon Snow.

635
00:40:30,617 --> 00:40:32,163
How's your lady love, Slayer?

636
00:40:32,488 --> 00:40:34,558
Her name is Gilly.

637
00:40:35,219 --> 00:40:36,928
Ser Slynt knows her quite well.

638
00:40:37,365 --> 00:40:40,006
They cowered together in the larder
during the battle for the Wall.

639
00:40:40,123 --> 00:40:41,687
Lies!

640
00:40:41,807 --> 00:40:44,516
A wildling girl, a baby,

641
00:40:44,977 --> 00:40:46,624
and Lord Janos.

642
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:49,300
I found him there after
the battle was over.

643
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:50,722
In a puddle of his own making.

644
00:40:55,143 --> 00:40:59,484
Whilst Lord Janos was hiding
with the women and children

645
00:41:00,294 --> 00:41:01,642
Jon Snow was leading.

646
00:41:02,867 --> 00:41:04,791
Ser Alliser fought bravely, it is true,

647
00:41:04,911 --> 00:41:07,106
but when he was wounded,
it was Jon who saved us.

648
00:41:07,458 --> 00:41:09,748
He took charge of the Wall's defense,

649
00:41:09,868 --> 00:41:11,843
he killed the Magnar of the Thenns,

650
00:41:12,501 --> 00:41:14,742
he went North to deal with Mance Rayder.

651
00:41:14,862 --> 00:41:17,812
Knowing it would almost certainly mean
his own death.

652
00:41:21,247 --> 00:41:22,514
Before that,

653
00:41:23,635 --> 00:41:27,387
he led the mission to avenge
Lord Commander Mormont.

654
00:41:28,767 --> 00:41:31,486
Mormont himself chose
Jon to be his steward.

655
00:41:31,798 --> 00:41:33,245
He saw something in Jon.

656
00:41:33,365 --> 00:41:35,215
And now we've all seen it too.

657
00:41:35,912 --> 00:41:37,209
He may be young,

658
00:41:38,481 --> 00:41:40,520
but he's the commander we turned to

659
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,316
when the night was darkest.

660
00:41:42,436 --> 00:41:43,848
Yeah!

661
00:41:49,998 --> 00:41:51,158
Aye.

662
00:41:51,433 --> 00:41:53,416
Can't argue with any of that.

663
00:41:54,663 --> 00:41:56,934
But who does Jon Snow want to command?

664
00:41:57,395 --> 00:41:58,704
The Night's Watch?

665
00:42:00,413 --> 00:42:01,798
Or the wildlings?

666
00:42:02,627 --> 00:42:05,970
Everyone knows he loved
a wildling girl.

667
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:07,903
He spoke with Mance Rayder many times.

668
00:42:08,023 --> 00:42:11,393
What would have happened in that tent
between those two old friends

669
00:42:11,942 --> 00:42:13,875
if Stannis's army hadn't come along?

670
00:42:14,157 --> 00:42:18,695
We all saw him put the King-Beyond-the-Wall
out of his misery.

671
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,110
Do you want to choose a man who has fought
the wildlings all his life

672
00:42:23,017 --> 00:42:25,188
or a man who makes love to them?

673
00:42:33,012 --> 00:42:34,459
It is time!

674
00:43:21,255 --> 00:43:23,869
Appears to be a tie, maester.

675
00:43:44,331 --> 00:43:46,175
Jon Snow! Jon Snow!

676
00:43:46,829 --> 00:43:48,614
Jon Snow! Jon Snow!

677
00:43:48,734 --> 00:43:50,755
Jon Snow! Jon Snow!

678
00:44:18,491 --> 00:44:20,927
You! You!

679
00:44:24,614 --> 00:44:25,808
What have you got there?

680
00:44:28,975 --> 00:44:31,558
- I said...
- Turn around and go!

681
00:44:33,848 --> 00:44:35,432
Turn around...

682
00:44:35,895 --> 00:44:38,209
- and go!
- That's a nice little sword.

683
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:40,743
Worth a hundred pigeons a sword like that.

684
00:44:43,179 --> 00:44:45,348
Nothing's worth anything to dead men.

685
00:44:49,368 --> 00:44:50,708
Quickly, go! Go!

686
00:45:04,373 --> 00:45:05,639
Who are you?

687
00:45:06,565 --> 00:45:08,222
Why were they scared of you?

688
00:45:08,342 --> 00:45:09,781
You lost this.

689
00:45:21,282 --> 00:45:23,256
You said there was no Jaqen H'ghar here.

690
00:45:23,597 --> 00:45:24,815
There isn't.

691
00:45:24,935 --> 00:45:27,032
A man is not Jaqen H'ghar.

692
00:45:29,712 --> 00:45:31,442
Who are you then?

693
00:45:32,368 --> 00:45:33,903
No one.

694
00:45:34,293 --> 00:45:36,169
And that is who a girl must become.

695
00:46:25,699 --> 00:46:27,445

696
00:46:27,794 --> 00:46:31,037

697
00:46:31,661 --> 00:46:34,525
_

698
00:46:47,765 --> 00:46:50,140
Why?

699
00:46:50,658 --> 00:46:52,942
_

700
00:46:54,891 --> 00:46:57,571

701

706
00:47:13,404 --> 00:47:15,850

707
00:47:16,099 --> 00:47:18,407
_

708
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:20,727
_

709
00:47:22,485 --> 00:47:25,744

710
00:47:29,255 --> 00:47:31,311

711
00:47:31,431 --> 00:47:34,052

712
00:47:35,955 --> 00:47:39,153
_

713
00:47:40,028 --> 00:47:43,721
_

714
00:47:45,833 --> 00:47:49,561

715
00:47:50,803 --> 00:47:54,726

716
00:47:57,083 --> 00:47:59,246

717
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:06,129

718
00:48:07,357 --> 00:48:10,555

719
00:48:10,675 --> 00:48:11,958

720
00:48:12,078 --> 00:48:13,639
_

721
00:48:18,609 --> 00:48:20,363
_

722
00:48:30,530 --> 00:48:32,015
Mhysa!

723
00:48:51,033 --> 00:48:53,583
Mhysa!

724
00:48:53,703 --> 00:48:55,829
Mhysa!

725
00:48:55,949 --> 00:48:58,532
Mhysa! Mhysa!

726
00:49:00,022 --> 00:49:03,183
She should have cut the traitor's head
in the Great Pyramid and be done with it.

727
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:05,366
That's what I keep telling
her to do to you.

728
00:49:11,065 --> 00:49:12,437
Mhysa!

729
00:49:12,557 --> 00:49:15,107
_

730
00:49:16,142 --> 00:49:17,626

_

739
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:31,360
Mhysa!

740
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:09,257
Mhysa!

741
00:52:12,548 --> 00:52:15,057
l'll stand guard outside
your door tonight, Your Grace.

742
00:52:15,177 --> 00:52:16,924
We all guard tonight.

743
00:52:18,015 --> 00:52:19,372
Leave me.

744
00:53:12,326 --> 00:53:14,042
Drogon!

745
00:53:37,668 --> 00:53:39,770
