1
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:12,539
I lost this dagger.

2
00:00:12,873 --> 00:00:13,873
To whom?

3
00:00:14,497 --> 00:00:15,664
Tyrion Lannister.

4
00:00:17,456 --> 00:00:19,455
Take a step toward a more
productive relationship

5
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:20,456
with a possible ally.

6
00:00:20,664 --> 00:00:22,663
I will allow you to mine
the dragonglass

7
00:00:22,664 --> 00:00:23,913
and forge weapons from it.

8
00:00:23,914 --> 00:00:24,914
Thank you.

9
00:00:25,873 --> 00:00:28,789
She has three
full-grown dragons, Your Grace.

10
00:00:29,372 --> 00:00:31,122
How do you propose to stop them?

11
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:34,039
We are currently at work
on a solution.

12
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:41,664
I thought
you'd be heading for Winterfell.

13
00:00:41,873 --> 00:00:43,413
Jon Snow came down
from Castle Black

14
00:00:43,414 --> 00:00:45,614
with a wildling army and won
the Battle of the Bastards.

15
00:00:45,789 --> 00:00:46,873
He's King of the North now.

16
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:50,490
Your sister's dead.

17
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:52,079
Euron has her.

18
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,706
I couldn't save her.
I tried.

19
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:57,205
You wouldn't be here
if you'd tried.

20
00:00:58,706 --> 00:00:59,873
What about Casterly Rock?

21
00:01:08,456 --> 00:01:11,039
We both know
how expensive war can be.

22
00:01:11,205 --> 00:01:12,539
Your vaults are empty.

23
00:01:12,831 --> 00:01:14,372
My debt will be paid in full.

24
00:01:15,205 --> 00:01:16,371
How will it happen?

25
00:01:16,372 --> 00:01:17,455
Will there be pain?

26
00:01:17,456 --> 00:01:18,873
No, I'll make sure of that.

27
00:01:19,164 --> 00:01:20,831
I'd hate to die like your son.

28
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:23,414
Not at all what I intended.

29
00:01:23,873 --> 00:01:24,956
Tell Cersei.

30
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:26,789
I want her to know it was me.

31
00:03:37,497 --> 00:03:39,497
Hold that wagon!

32
00:03:53,664 --> 00:03:55,913
You've just won the biggest
prize in the world.

33
00:03:55,914 --> 00:03:58,164
What could you possibly
have to be upset about?

34
00:04:00,247 --> 00:04:02,371
Come on,
you can tell me.

35
00:04:02,372 --> 00:04:04,913
Queen of Thorns give you one
last prick in the balls

36
00:04:04,914 --> 00:04:06,246
before saying goodbye?

37
00:04:06,247 --> 00:04:08,830
I'll save my confessions
for the High Septon.

38
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:11,038
There is no more
High Septon.

39
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:13,288
No, there isn't,
is there?

40
00:04:13,289 --> 00:04:16,581
There is still
the question of my prize.

41
00:04:18,414 --> 00:04:21,246
That's a lot of money
I just gave you.

42
00:04:21,247 --> 00:04:22,581
It's not a castle.

43
00:04:24,247 --> 00:04:26,413
How about that one?
It's available.

44
00:04:26,414 --> 00:04:27,788
You don't want
Highgarden.

45
00:04:27,789 --> 00:04:30,580
- I beg to differ.
- We're at war.

46
00:04:30,581 --> 00:04:33,789
Daenerys Targaryen could come and take
it back the day after you move in.

47
00:04:35,164 --> 00:04:37,038
Besides,
think of the upkeep.

48
00:04:37,039 --> 00:04:40,079
The more you owe,
the more it weighs you down.

49
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,663
Oh, is that why
you're so fucking glum, eh?

50
00:04:42,664 --> 00:04:44,581
All your new riches
weighing you down?

51
00:04:45,956 --> 00:04:48,121
- Move out!
- They're not mine.

52
00:04:48,122 --> 00:04:50,872
This all belongs
to the Iron Bank.

53
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:54,121
See?
We pay our debts.

54
00:04:54,122 --> 00:04:55,956
Right,
just not to me.

55
00:04:57,831 --> 00:05:00,621
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater,
formerly of...

56
00:05:00,622 --> 00:05:03,079
whatever nameless
shit heap you're from

57
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,997
with a saddlebag
full of gold,

58
00:05:04,998 --> 00:05:07,455
complaining about
not getting paid.

59
00:05:07,456 --> 00:05:09,246
When we win this war,

60
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:11,121
all the castles
in the Seven Kingdoms

61
00:05:11,122 --> 00:05:12,580
will be yours
to choose from,

62
00:05:12,581 --> 00:05:13,997
with no one left
to take them away from you.

63
00:05:13,998 --> 00:05:15,872
Yes, I'm sure
Queen Cersei's reign

64
00:05:15,873 --> 00:05:17,329
will be quiet
and peaceable.

65
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:18,913
Ah, stranger things
have happened.

66
00:05:18,914 --> 00:05:19,956
Like what?

67
00:05:21,998 --> 00:05:24,955
The granaries are being emptied
and loaded into wagons, my lord.

68
00:05:24,956 --> 00:05:27,788
- The current harvest?
- We have teams of men collecting it

69
00:05:27,789 --> 00:05:29,455
from all the farms
in the Reach.

70
00:05:29,456 --> 00:05:31,788
Ser Bronn, will you
accompany the Tarlys

71
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:33,955
and help them
accelerate this process?

72
00:05:33,956 --> 00:05:35,955
I'm not much
for shoveling wheat.

73
00:05:35,956 --> 00:05:41,121
No, but motivating reluctant farmers
to hand over their harvest...

74
00:05:41,122 --> 00:05:43,164
I bet you're going to have
a real talent for that.

75
00:05:45,289 --> 00:05:46,997
My lord.

76
00:05:46,998 --> 00:05:48,122
My lord.

77
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:51,330
My lord.

78
00:06:01,956 --> 00:06:04,246
I must say,
I don't think the Iron Bank

79
00:06:04,247 --> 00:06:08,997
has ever had a debt of this magnitude
repaid in a single installment.

80
00:06:08,998 --> 00:06:13,204
I always considered your father a
very effective and efficient man,

81
00:06:13,205 --> 00:06:16,830
but you appear to be redefining
those terms entirely.

82
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:19,038
You're too kind,
my lord.

83
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:22,204
I am neither kind
nor a lord, Your Grace.

84
00:06:22,205 --> 00:06:25,371
I am merely an instrument of
the institution I represent.

85
00:06:25,372 --> 00:06:29,121
Its well-being is a matter
of arithmetic, not sentiment.

86
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:32,205
And the current arithmetic
is outstanding.

87
00:06:33,414 --> 00:06:35,496
- Uh, the gold...
- Is on its way.

88
00:06:35,497 --> 00:06:39,496
My brother is supervising
its transportation himself.

89
00:06:39,497 --> 00:06:42,413
Some at the Iron Bank
will be disappointed.

90
00:06:42,414 --> 00:06:45,163
They've grown rather fond
of your interest payments.

91
00:06:45,164 --> 00:06:48,413
We must devise a way
to raise their spirits.

92
00:06:48,414 --> 00:06:50,872
Yes, perhaps we could
be of assistance

93
00:06:50,873 --> 00:06:53,663
in some
current venture.

94
00:06:53,664 --> 00:06:55,621
My only venture
at this moment

95
00:06:55,622 --> 00:06:58,288
is reestablishing control
over this continent

96
00:06:58,289 --> 00:07:00,580
and every person on it.

97
00:07:00,581 --> 00:07:03,413
I see a great deal
of potential in that venture.

98
00:07:03,414 --> 00:07:07,371
I imagine it would require
outside investment.

99
00:07:07,372 --> 00:07:08,621
It will, indeed.

100
00:07:08,622 --> 00:07:11,580
I need to expand
my armies, my navies.

101
00:07:11,581 --> 00:07:15,288
My Hand, Qyburn, has made overtures
to the Golden Company in Essos.

102
00:07:15,289 --> 00:07:16,496
I know them well.

103
00:07:16,497 --> 00:07:18,955
They have helped us
recover significant sums

104
00:07:18,956 --> 00:07:21,913
from parties who had
fallen into deep arrears.

105
00:07:21,914 --> 00:07:23,621
That's good to hear.

106
00:07:23,622 --> 00:07:27,039
I, too, would like them to recover
some things that belong to me.

107
00:07:28,456 --> 00:07:30,747
Rest assured,
Your Grace,

108
00:07:30,748 --> 00:07:33,663
you can count on
the Iron Bank's support.

109
00:07:33,664 --> 00:07:36,706
- Hmm.
- As soon as the gold arrives.

110
00:07:40,456 --> 00:07:41,789
This is for you.

111
00:07:46,581 --> 00:07:49,288
The last man who wielded it
meant to cut your throat,

112
00:07:49,289 --> 00:07:51,122
but your mother
fought him off.

113
00:07:59,914 --> 00:08:01,955
The other dagger,

114
00:08:01,956 --> 00:08:04,621
the one that
took her life,

115
00:08:04,622 --> 00:08:07,830
I would have stopped that
dagger with my own heart

116
00:08:07,831 --> 00:08:09,247
if I could have.

117
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:13,956
I wasn't there for her
when she needed me most.

118
00:08:15,664 --> 00:08:18,663
But I am here
for her now

119
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:21,371
to do what she would have done,

120
00:08:21,372 --> 00:08:23,330
to protect her children.

121
00:08:25,914 --> 00:08:29,830
Anything I can do
for you, Brandon,

122
00:08:29,831 --> 00:08:32,164
you need only ask.

123
00:08:34,664 --> 00:08:37,371
Do you know
who this belonged to?

124
00:08:37,372 --> 00:08:40,079
No.

125
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,913
That very question was what started
the War of the Five Kings.

126
00:08:43,914 --> 00:08:48,329
In a way, that dagger made
you what you are today.

127
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:50,204
Forced from your home,

128
00:08:50,205 --> 00:08:52,705
driven out to the wilds
beyond the Wall.

129
00:08:52,706 --> 00:08:57,456
I imagine you've seen things
most men wouldn't believe.

130
00:09:06,914 --> 00:09:10,038
To go through all of that
and make your way home again

131
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:14,663
only to find such chaos
in the world,

132
00:09:14,664 --> 00:09:15,705
I can only imagine...

133
00:09:15,706 --> 00:09:17,664
Chaos is a ladder.

134
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:32,955
I'm sorry to have
disturbed you, Lord Stark.

135
00:09:32,956 --> 00:09:34,372
I'm not Lord Stark.

136
00:09:45,748 --> 00:09:47,872
What's that?

137
00:09:47,873 --> 00:09:49,872
Maester Wolkan built it for me

138
00:09:49,873 --> 00:09:51,413
so I can move around
more easily.

139
00:09:51,414 --> 00:09:53,247
It's a very good idea.

140
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,956
You're leaving.

141
00:09:59,247 --> 00:10:00,913
I don't want
to leave you,

142
00:10:00,914 --> 00:10:03,913
but when...
when they come,

143
00:10:03,914 --> 00:10:05,622
I need to be
with my family.

144
00:10:06,831 --> 00:10:08,705
And you're safe.

145
00:10:08,706 --> 00:10:10,581
Well, as safe
as anyone can be now.

146
00:10:11,706 --> 00:10:13,914
You don't
need me anymore.

147
00:10:14,998 --> 00:10:16,539
No, I don't.

148
00:10:20,998 --> 00:10:22,118
That's all
you've got to say?

149
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:25,164
Thank you.

150
00:10:26,622 --> 00:10:28,621
Thank you?

151
00:10:28,622 --> 00:10:30,289
For helping me.

152
00:10:32,205 --> 00:10:34,413
My brother
died for you.

153
00:10:34,414 --> 00:10:37,121
Hodor and Summer
died for you.

154
00:10:37,122 --> 00:10:39,456
I almost died for you.

155
00:10:43,289 --> 00:10:46,289
- Bran...
- I'm not, really.

156
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:49,788
Not anymore.

157
00:10:51,956 --> 00:10:55,246
I remember what it felt
like to be Brandon Stark,

158
00:10:55,247 --> 00:10:58,748
but I remember
so much else now.

159
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:07,456
You died in that cave.

160
00:11:45,831 --> 00:11:47,246
I did.

161
00:11:47,247 --> 00:11:49,663
The kitchen girl,
the redhead with the behind.

162
00:11:49,664 --> 00:11:54,329
The only thing in the kitchen that
you've put your cock in is the liver.

163
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:57,663
'Ey up.
Where you going?

164
00:11:57,664 --> 00:12:00,204
In there.
I live here.

165
00:12:00,205 --> 00:12:01,913
Fuck off.

166
00:12:01,914 --> 00:12:03,998
I'm Arya Stark.
This is my home.

167
00:12:07,873 --> 00:12:09,497
Arya Stark's dead.

168
00:12:12,205 --> 00:12:14,329
Send for Maester Luwin
or Ser Rodrick.

169
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:17,371
- They'll tell you who I am.
- There's no Rodrick here.

170
00:12:17,372 --> 00:12:19,204
Maester's named Wolkan.

171
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:22,371
Go ask Jon Snow, then,
the King in the North.

172
00:12:22,372 --> 00:12:24,913
- He's my brother.
- He's a thousand miles away.

173
00:12:24,914 --> 00:12:27,705
Look, it's cold
and we're busy,

174
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:31,079
- so, you know, best fuck off.
- Mm.

175
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,956
If Jon's gone, who's in
charge of Winterfell?

176
00:12:35,289 --> 00:12:39,121
The Lady of Winterfell.
Lady Stark.

177
00:12:39,122 --> 00:12:40,830
- Which Lady Stark?
- You tell us.

178
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:42,581
You're the one
impersonating her sister.

179
00:12:46,289 --> 00:12:48,413
Tell Sansa
her sister's home.

180
00:12:48,414 --> 00:12:52,747
Lady Sansa is too busy to waste
her breath on you, just like us.

181
00:12:52,748 --> 00:12:56,079
So, for the last time,
fuck off.

182
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:03,204
I'm getting into this castle
one way or another.

183
00:13:03,205 --> 00:13:06,705
If I'm not who I say I am,
I won't last long.

184
00:13:06,706 --> 00:13:10,748
But if I am and Sansa finds
out you turned me away...

185
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:20,955
Right, you sit there.

186
00:13:20,956 --> 00:13:23,163
Right there.

187
00:13:23,164 --> 00:13:24,164
Don't move.

188
00:13:25,789 --> 00:13:28,121
Right, go tell Lady Stark.
I'll watch her.

189
00:13:28,122 --> 00:13:31,455
I ain't telling Lady Stark.
You can tell her.

190
00:13:31,456 --> 00:13:32,831
Why me?

191
00:13:58,039 --> 00:14:00,079
- You're gonna tell her.
- I'm not.

192
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,997
'Cause if you don't, I'm gonna hit
you right in the fucking face

193
00:14:02,998 --> 00:14:04,372
as hard as I can.

194
00:14:12,664 --> 00:14:14,121
We told her to wait.

195
00:14:14,122 --> 00:14:16,872
We were standing
right next to her, and...

196
00:14:16,873 --> 00:14:18,997
And... and when we turned
around, she'd gone, my lady.

197
00:14:18,998 --> 00:14:20,872
She... she was nothing.
Some winter town girl.

198
00:14:20,873 --> 00:14:23,663
She comes in asking
for, uh, Ser Rodrick...

199
00:14:23,664 --> 00:14:26,163
- Rodrick, yeah. Luwin, yeah.
- ...and Maester Luwin.

200
00:14:26,164 --> 00:14:28,580
And don't
trouble yourself over it, my lady.

201
00:14:28,581 --> 00:14:31,788
- We'll... we'll find her.
- You don't have to.

202
00:14:31,789 --> 00:14:33,288
I know where she is.

203
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:51,831
Do I have to call you
Lady Stark now?

204
00:14:53,914 --> 00:14:55,539
Yes.

205
00:15:12,622 --> 00:15:14,955
You shouldn't have run
from the guards.

206
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:16,997
I didn't run.

207
00:15:16,998 --> 00:15:18,372
You need better guards.

208
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:28,205
It suits you...
Lady Stark.

209
00:15:29,372 --> 00:15:31,246
Jon left you
in charge?

210
00:15:31,247 --> 00:15:32,622
He did.

211
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:36,538
I hope
he comes back soon.

212
00:15:36,539 --> 00:15:38,371
I remember how happy
he was to see me.

213
00:15:38,372 --> 00:15:41,705
When he sees you, his
heart will probably stop.

214
00:15:51,581 --> 00:15:53,788
It doesn't look
like him.

215
00:15:53,789 --> 00:15:57,079
Should've been carved
by someone who knew his face.

216
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:00,080
Everyone who knew
his face is dead.

217
00:16:02,414 --> 00:16:03,581
We're not.

218
00:16:09,247 --> 00:16:11,329
They say
you killed Joffrey.

219
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:13,621
Did you?

220
00:16:13,622 --> 00:16:15,288
I wish I had.

221
00:16:15,289 --> 00:16:18,329
Hmm.
Me, too.

222
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:20,956
I was angry when I heard
someone else had done it.

223
00:16:22,956 --> 00:16:25,621
However long my list got,
he was always first.

224
00:16:25,622 --> 00:16:27,538
Your list?

225
00:16:27,539 --> 00:16:29,748
Of people
I'm going to kill.

226
00:16:39,622 --> 00:16:42,371
How did you get back
to Winterfell?

227
00:16:42,372 --> 00:16:44,204
It's a long story.

228
00:16:44,205 --> 00:16:46,288
I imagine
yours is, too.

229
00:16:46,289 --> 00:16:48,246
Yes.

230
00:16:48,247 --> 00:16:50,371
Not a very
pleasant one.

231
00:16:50,372 --> 00:16:52,372
Mine neither.

232
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:58,121
But our stories
aren't over yet.

233
00:16:58,122 --> 00:17:00,998
No, they're not.

234
00:17:08,122 --> 00:17:09,497
Arya...

235
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,205
Bran's home, too.

236
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:53,873
You came home.

237
00:18:07,748 --> 00:18:09,748
I saw you
at the crossroads.

238
00:18:11,581 --> 00:18:12,913
You saw me?

239
00:18:12,914 --> 00:18:15,413
I see quite a lot now.

240
00:18:15,414 --> 00:18:20,246
Bran has... visions.

241
00:18:20,247 --> 00:18:22,413
I thought you might go
to King's Landing.

242
00:18:22,414 --> 00:18:24,663
So did I.

243
00:18:24,664 --> 00:18:26,538
Why would you
go back there?

244
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:29,122
Cersei's on
her list of names.

245
00:18:40,664 --> 00:18:42,538
Who else
is on your list?

246
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:44,289
Most of them
are dead already.

247
00:18:55,414 --> 00:18:57,747
Where did
you get this?

248
00:18:57,748 --> 00:18:59,164
Littlefinger
gave it to me.

249
00:19:00,456 --> 00:19:02,705
Littlefinger?
He's here?

250
00:19:02,706 --> 00:19:04,580
He has declared
for House Stark.

251
00:19:04,581 --> 00:19:06,455
Why would he
give you a dagger?

252
00:19:06,456 --> 00:19:08,955
- He thought I'd want it.
- Why?

253
00:19:08,956 --> 00:19:10,663
Because it was
meant to kill me.

254
00:19:10,664 --> 00:19:15,538
The cutthroat...
after your fall?

255
00:19:15,539 --> 00:19:18,413
Why would a cutthroat
have a Valyrian steel dagger?

256
00:19:18,414 --> 00:19:21,455
Someone very wealthy
wanted me dead.

257
00:19:21,456 --> 00:19:22,621
He's not
a generous man.

258
00:19:22,622 --> 00:19:23,997
He wouldn't
give you anything

259
00:19:23,998 --> 00:19:25,914
unless he thought he was
getting something back.

260
00:19:28,289 --> 00:19:31,288
- It doesn't matter.
- What do you mean it doesn't matter?

261
00:19:31,289 --> 00:19:33,205
I don't want it.

262
00:19:37,497 --> 00:19:38,539
Are you sure?

263
00:19:39,831 --> 00:19:41,246
It's Valyrian steel.

264
00:19:41,247 --> 00:19:43,622
It's wasted
on a cripple.

265
00:20:19,414 --> 00:20:22,913
Catelyn Stark
would be proud.

266
00:20:22,914 --> 00:20:25,288
You kept your vow.

267
00:20:25,289 --> 00:20:26,705
I did
next to nothing.

268
00:20:26,706 --> 00:20:28,621
You're too hard
on yourself, my lady.

269
00:20:28,622 --> 00:20:30,205
I'm not a...

270
00:20:33,372 --> 00:20:34,998
Thank you, Podrick.

271
00:20:52,873 --> 00:20:56,246
Your Grace, there's still
no word from the Unsullied.

272
00:20:56,247 --> 00:20:57,913
Soon.

273
00:20:57,914 --> 00:20:59,748
He will
come back to you.

274
00:21:01,622 --> 00:21:02,956
He'd better.

275
00:21:05,205 --> 00:21:07,913
What happened?

276
00:21:07,914 --> 00:21:09,247
Many things.

277
00:21:12,581 --> 00:21:13,789
Many things?

278
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:17,372
Your Grace.

279
00:21:45,456 --> 00:21:46,705
I wanted you
to see it

280
00:21:46,706 --> 00:21:49,456
before we start
hacking it to bits.

281
00:22:26,539 --> 00:22:29,372
Well, this is it.
All we'll ever need.

282
00:22:35,414 --> 00:22:38,873
There is something else I
want to show you, Your Grace.

283
00:23:03,998 --> 00:23:06,079
The children of the
forest made these.

284
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,914
When?

285
00:23:13,414 --> 00:23:15,706
A very long time ago.

286
00:23:18,873 --> 00:23:21,329
They were right here,

287
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:23,747
standing where
we're standing.

288
00:23:23,748 --> 00:23:28,913
Before there were Targaryens
or Starks or Lannisters.

289
00:23:28,914 --> 00:23:30,998
Maybe even before
there were men.

290
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,330
No.

291
00:23:43,873 --> 00:23:48,580
They were here together,
the children and the First Men.

292
00:23:48,581 --> 00:23:50,789
Doing what?
Fighting each other?

293
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:06,371
They fought together
against their common enemy.

294
00:24:06,372 --> 00:24:10,247
Despite their differences,
despite their suspicions.

295
00:24:12,414 --> 00:24:13,414
Together.

296
00:24:15,247 --> 00:24:18,330
We need to do the same
if we're going to survive.

297
00:24:21,956 --> 00:24:24,164
Because the enemy
is real.

298
00:24:25,789 --> 00:24:27,414
It's always been real.

299
00:24:37,956 --> 00:24:39,705
And you say
you can't defeat them

300
00:24:39,706 --> 00:24:43,621
without my armies
and my dragons?

301
00:24:43,622 --> 00:24:46,247
No, I don't think I can.

302
00:24:54,456 --> 00:24:56,747
I will fight for you.

303
00:24:56,748 --> 00:24:58,622
I will fight
for the North.

304
00:25:02,706 --> 00:25:04,873
When you
bend the knee.

305
00:25:10,497 --> 00:25:12,039
My people...

306
00:25:13,456 --> 00:25:15,747
won't accept
a southern ruler.

307
00:25:15,748 --> 00:25:18,289
Not after everything
they've suffered.

308
00:25:21,789 --> 00:25:24,330
They will
if their king does.

309
00:25:25,998 --> 00:25:28,997
They chose you
to lead them.

310
00:25:28,998 --> 00:25:31,164
They chose you
to protect them.

311
00:25:32,789 --> 00:25:35,998
Isn't their survival more
important than your pride?

312
00:25:56,372 --> 00:25:58,455
What is it?

313
00:25:58,456 --> 00:26:01,204
We took
Casterly Rock.

314
00:26:01,205 --> 00:26:03,205
That's very good
to hear.

315
00:26:07,706 --> 00:26:08,873
Isn't it?

316
00:26:16,914 --> 00:26:19,204
You'll want to discuss
this amongst yourselves.

317
00:26:19,205 --> 00:26:20,873
- Perhaps...
- You will stay.

318
00:26:21,956 --> 00:26:23,955
All my allies are gone.

319
00:26:23,956 --> 00:26:26,371
They've been taken from me while I've
been sitting here on this island.

320
00:26:26,372 --> 00:26:28,913
- You still have the largest armies.
- Who won't be able to eat

321
00:26:28,914 --> 00:26:30,997
because Cersei has taken
all the food from the Reach.

322
00:26:30,998 --> 00:26:32,997
Call Grey Worm
and the Unsullied back.

323
00:26:32,998 --> 00:26:35,788
We still have enough ships to carry
the Dothraki to the mainland.

324
00:26:35,789 --> 00:26:38,038
Commit to the blockade
of King's Landing.

325
00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:41,079
- We have a plan. It's still the right plan.
- The right plan!

326
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:45,872
Your strategy has lost us Dorne,
the Iron Islands, and the Reach.

327
00:26:45,873 --> 00:26:49,288
- If I have underestimated our enemies...
- Our enemies?

328
00:26:49,289 --> 00:26:51,538
Your family, you mean.

329
00:26:51,539 --> 00:26:54,413
Perhaps you don't want
to hurt them after all.

330
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:05,329
Enough with
the clever plans.

331
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:06,997
I have three
large dragons.

332
00:27:06,998 --> 00:27:08,705
I'm going to fly them
to the Red Keep.

333
00:27:08,706 --> 00:27:10,038
We've discussed this.

334
00:27:10,039 --> 00:27:13,288
My enemies
are in the Red Keep.

335
00:27:13,289 --> 00:27:16,663
What kind of a queen am I if I'm not
willing to risk my life to fight them?

336
00:27:16,664 --> 00:27:18,414
A smart one.

337
00:27:21,789 --> 00:27:23,789
What do you think
I should do?

338
00:27:26,122 --> 00:27:28,371
- I would never presume to...
- I'm at war.

339
00:27:28,372 --> 00:27:30,414
I'm losing.

340
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,956
What do you think
I should do?

341
00:27:40,539 --> 00:27:42,997
I never thought that
dragons would exist again.

342
00:27:42,998 --> 00:27:43,998
No one did.

343
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:48,121
The people
who follow you

344
00:27:48,122 --> 00:27:51,289
know that you made
something impossible happen.

345
00:27:52,664 --> 00:27:54,163
Maybe that
helps them believe

346
00:27:54,164 --> 00:27:57,329
that you can make other
impossible things happen.

347
00:27:57,330 --> 00:27:59,288
Build a world
that's different

348
00:27:59,289 --> 00:28:01,706
from the shit one
they've always known.

349
00:28:03,956 --> 00:28:08,329
But if you use them to melt
castles and burn cities,

350
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:09,956
you're not different.

351
00:28:11,664 --> 00:28:13,664
You're just
more of the same.

352
00:28:28,497 --> 00:28:30,164
Don't lunge.

353
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:44,998
Don't go where
your enemy leads you.

354
00:28:46,664 --> 00:28:48,039
Up.

355
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:55,998
- And don't...
- Don't fight someone like her in the first place.

356
00:29:01,706 --> 00:29:03,205
Nice sword.

357
00:29:05,497 --> 00:29:06,831
Very nice dagger.

358
00:29:14,205 --> 00:29:17,163
If they haven't contributed the right
amount of grain to the stores,

359
00:29:17,164 --> 00:29:19,580
then I'm afraid they'll have to
make due with what they've brought.

360
00:29:19,581 --> 00:29:20,873
We can't...

361
00:29:25,205 --> 00:29:26,747
It's been a while
since I trained.

362
00:29:26,748 --> 00:29:29,371
I can go and find the master
of arms for you, my lady.

363
00:29:29,372 --> 00:29:32,246
He didn't beat
the Hound.

364
00:29:32,247 --> 00:29:34,288
You did.

365
00:29:34,289 --> 00:29:35,789
I want to train
with you.

366
00:29:37,873 --> 00:29:41,163
You swore to serve
both my mother's daughters,

367
00:29:41,164 --> 00:29:42,289
didn't you?

368
00:29:49,956 --> 00:29:51,581
Move aside, Podrick.

369
00:29:56,122 --> 00:29:58,538
You can't use that, my lady.
It's too small.

370
00:29:58,539 --> 00:30:00,748
I won't cut you.
Don't worry.

371
00:30:02,164 --> 00:30:04,122
I'll try not to.

372
00:31:19,706 --> 00:31:21,705
Who taught you
how to do that?

373
00:31:21,706 --> 00:31:23,372
No one.

374
00:31:57,998 --> 00:32:00,663
- What do you think of her?
- Who?

375
00:32:00,664 --> 00:32:05,121
I believe you
know of whom I speak.

376
00:32:05,122 --> 00:32:07,455
I think she has
a good heart.

377
00:32:07,456 --> 00:32:09,246
A good heart?

378
00:32:09,247 --> 00:32:11,913
I've noticed you staring
at her good heart.

379
00:32:11,914 --> 00:32:14,747
There's no time
for that.

380
00:32:14,748 --> 00:32:17,581
I saw the Night King, Davos.
I looked into his eyes.

381
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,496
How many men do we have
in the North to fight him?

382
00:32:21,497 --> 00:32:23,038
10,000? Less?

383
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:25,163
- Fewer.
- What?

384
00:32:25,164 --> 00:32:28,706
Speaking of good hearts...
Missandei of Naath.

385
00:32:29,831 --> 00:32:32,705
Ser Davos, Lord Snow.

386
00:32:32,706 --> 00:32:34,246
King Snow, isn't it?

387
00:32:34,247 --> 00:32:35,621
No, that doesn't
sound right.

388
00:32:35,622 --> 00:32:37,496
- King Jon?
- It doesn't matter.

389
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:40,329
Forgive me, but may
I ask a question?

390
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:42,288
Of course.

391
00:32:42,289 --> 00:32:46,163
Your name is Jon Snow, but your
father's name was Ned Stark?

392
00:32:46,164 --> 00:32:48,330
I'm a bastard.

393
00:32:50,205 --> 00:32:52,288
My mother and father
weren't married.

394
00:32:52,289 --> 00:32:54,246
Is the custom
different in Naath?

395
00:32:54,247 --> 00:32:56,163
We don't have
marriage in Naath,

396
00:32:56,164 --> 00:32:59,121
so the concept of a
bastard doesn't exist.

397
00:32:59,122 --> 00:33:02,622
That sounds...
liberating.

398
00:33:04,622 --> 00:33:06,830
Why did you leave
your homeland?

399
00:33:06,831 --> 00:33:09,455
I was stolen away by slavers.

400
00:33:09,456 --> 00:33:10,955
I'm sorry.

401
00:33:10,956 --> 00:33:14,079
If I may,
how did a slave girl

402
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,329
come to advise
Daenerys Targaryen?

403
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:20,204
She bought me from my
master and set me free.

404
00:33:20,205 --> 00:33:21,997
That was good of her.

405
00:33:21,998 --> 00:33:25,955
Of course, you're serving
her now, aren't you?

406
00:33:25,956 --> 00:33:30,121
I serve my queen because I
want to serve my queen.

407
00:33:30,122 --> 00:33:31,872
Because
I believe in her.

408
00:33:31,873 --> 00:33:34,830
And if you wanted to sail
home to Naath tomorrow?

409
00:33:34,831 --> 00:33:38,164
Then she would give me a ship
and wish me good fortune.

410
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:40,330
You believe that?

411
00:33:41,706 --> 00:33:43,163
I know it.

412
00:33:43,164 --> 00:33:46,163
All of us who came
with her from Essos,

413
00:33:46,164 --> 00:33:47,872
we believe in her.

414
00:33:47,873 --> 00:33:50,538
She's not our queen
because she's the daughter

415
00:33:50,539 --> 00:33:53,663
of some king
we never knew.

416
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:56,456
She's the queen
we chose.

417
00:33:58,039 --> 00:34:00,330
Will you forgive me
if I switch sides?

418
00:34:05,581 --> 00:34:07,497
Is that a Greyjoy ship?

419
00:34:24,748 --> 00:34:26,372
Halt!

420
00:34:50,914 --> 00:34:52,581
Jon.

421
00:34:55,748 --> 00:34:57,080
I didn't know
you were here.

422
00:35:04,247 --> 00:35:06,414
S-Sansa...

423
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:10,414
is she all right?

424
00:35:11,456 --> 00:35:13,581
What you did for her...

425
00:35:14,873 --> 00:35:16,914
is the only reason
I'm not killing you.

426
00:35:25,372 --> 00:35:27,955
We heard your uncle
attacked your fleet.

427
00:35:27,956 --> 00:35:30,788
We thought
you were dead.

428
00:35:30,789 --> 00:35:32,413
I should be.

429
00:35:32,414 --> 00:35:33,789
Your sister?

430
00:35:35,414 --> 00:35:37,913
Euron has her.

431
00:35:37,914 --> 00:35:40,622
I came to ask the queen
to help me get her back.

432
00:35:43,456 --> 00:35:44,914
The queen is gone.

433
00:35:46,789 --> 00:35:49,246
Where did she go?

434
00:35:49,247 --> 00:35:52,831
Get the horses watered!

435
00:36:08,664 --> 00:36:11,496
All the gold's safely through
the gates of King's Landing.

436
00:36:11,497 --> 00:36:12,663
Good.

437
00:36:12,664 --> 00:36:13,997
We need to get
the last of these wagons

438
00:36:13,998 --> 00:36:16,079
over the Blackwater Rush
before nightfall.

439
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,788
The head of the line
is ambushed,

440
00:36:17,789 --> 00:36:20,079
the tail will never be able
to reinforce in time.

441
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,705
Well, we are stretched
a bit thin.

442
00:36:21,706 --> 00:36:23,163
With your permission,

443
00:36:23,164 --> 00:36:26,330
flogging stragglers has a
marked effect on mobility.

444
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,788
Let's give them
fair warning first.

445
00:36:30,789 --> 00:36:32,706
These men fought well
at Highgarden.

446
00:36:43,664 --> 00:36:46,079
Now, get it on this thing.

447
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:48,330
Lift!

448
00:36:51,581 --> 00:36:53,329
- Ser Jaime.
- Rickon.

449
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:54,748
Dickon.

450
00:36:58,164 --> 00:37:00,830
I hear you fought bravely
at Highgarden.

451
00:37:00,831 --> 00:37:02,039
Your first battle?

452
00:37:03,873 --> 00:37:06,246
And?

453
00:37:06,247 --> 00:37:07,496
It was glorious.

454
00:37:07,497 --> 00:37:10,039
Come on,
your father's
not here.

455
00:37:11,539 --> 00:37:14,455
All my life, we've been
pledged to House Tyrell.

456
00:37:14,456 --> 00:37:17,705
I knew some of those men.
I hunted with them.

457
00:37:17,706 --> 00:37:20,455
They didn't
deserve to die.

458
00:37:20,456 --> 00:37:22,621
But Lady Olenna
chose to betray her queen

459
00:37:22,622 --> 00:37:24,747
and support
the Targaryen girl.

460
00:37:24,748 --> 00:37:27,705
So here we are.

461
00:37:27,706 --> 00:37:29,872
I didn't expect it
to smell like that.

462
00:37:29,873 --> 00:37:31,955
Men shit themselves
when they die.

463
00:37:31,956 --> 00:37:34,039
Didn't they teach you that
at fancy lad school?

464
00:37:35,914 --> 00:37:38,080
Well, I learned it
when I was five.

465
00:37:45,122 --> 00:37:47,288
What?

466
00:37:47,289 --> 00:37:49,246
Listen.

467
00:38:00,956 --> 00:38:04,705
Spears and shields!
Spears and shields!

468
00:38:04,706 --> 00:38:06,246
- What is it?
- Get in line!

469
00:38:06,247 --> 00:38:09,247
Spears and shields!
Spears and shields!

470
00:38:10,706 --> 00:38:13,747
Get in line now!

471
00:38:13,748 --> 00:38:15,955
Form up!
Come on, lads!

472
00:38:15,956 --> 00:38:17,538
Guard those wagons!

473
00:38:17,539 --> 00:38:19,998
Form a line!
Form a line!

474
00:38:23,414 --> 00:38:25,122
Round those spears!

475
00:38:31,956 --> 00:38:34,122
Shield wall!

476
00:38:35,456 --> 00:38:37,121
Fill the gaps!

477
00:38:37,122 --> 00:38:40,455
- Archers, steady!
- Hold together!

478
00:38:40,456 --> 00:38:42,496
- Archers!
- Look alive!

479
00:38:42,497 --> 00:38:44,288
Get tight!

480
00:38:44,289 --> 00:38:46,121
Get in line, boys!

481
00:38:46,122 --> 00:38:48,538
- Ready!
- Here they come!

482
00:39:13,539 --> 00:39:15,872
Courage, lads!
Courage!

483
00:39:15,873 --> 00:39:18,788
Wait! Wait for it!

484
00:39:18,789 --> 00:39:20,955
Spears out!

485
00:39:25,164 --> 00:39:28,539
- Spears out!
- Steady! Hold the line!

486
00:39:38,247 --> 00:39:40,830
- Get back to King's Landing.
- I'm not abandoning my army.

487
00:39:40,831 --> 00:39:43,163
You're the commander,
not a damn infantryman.

488
00:39:43,164 --> 00:39:45,205
Those fuckers are
about to swamp us.

489
00:39:46,372 --> 00:39:48,371
We can hold them off.

490
00:40:06,372 --> 00:40:07,872
Dracarys!

491
00:40:45,622 --> 00:40:48,038
Hold the line!

492
00:40:48,039 --> 00:40:49,414
Hold!

493
00:40:50,831 --> 00:40:52,956
- Hold it, lads!
- Hold the line!

494
00:40:56,372 --> 00:40:59,289
Throw it!

495
00:41:01,122 --> 00:41:02,581
Hold!

496
00:41:25,247 --> 00:41:27,455
Draw!

497
00:41:27,456 --> 00:41:28,456
Loose!

498
00:42:03,330 --> 00:42:05,580
- Archers!
- Archers!

499
00:42:05,581 --> 00:42:07,329
Archers, with me!

500
00:42:07,330 --> 00:42:10,289
- Archers, to the line!
- To the line!

501
00:42:15,956 --> 00:42:17,663
- Nock!
- Nock!

502
00:42:17,664 --> 00:42:20,164
Draw!

503
00:42:29,205 --> 00:42:30,873
- Loose!
- Loose!

504
00:42:37,998 --> 00:42:39,205
Run!

505
00:42:50,706 --> 00:42:52,329
Qyburn's scorpion
is over there.

506
00:42:52,330 --> 00:42:53,371
Go get it, then.

507
00:42:53,372 --> 00:42:54,873
I can't shoot
with one hand.

508
00:42:57,539 --> 00:42:59,873
Come on!

509
00:44:11,831 --> 00:44:14,289
Need help!

510
00:45:16,289 --> 00:45:17,998
Where are you?

511
00:46:28,330 --> 00:46:30,080
Take cover!

512
00:47:26,497 --> 00:47:27,872
Come on, you fucker.

513
00:47:27,873 --> 00:47:29,039
Dracarys.

514
00:48:42,456 --> 00:48:43,456
Flee, you idiot.

515
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:47,080
Come on, boy. Come on!

516
00:48:55,914 --> 00:48:58,956
You idiot.
You fucking idiot.

517
00:50:51,622 --> 00:50:53,302
I'm not here to murder.

518
00:50:53,497 --> 00:50:55,205
Bend the knee and join me.

519
00:50:55,581 --> 00:50:58,205
Or refuse... and die.

520
00:51:00,706 --> 00:51:03,164
You need to find a way
to make her listen.

521
00:51:04,205 --> 00:51:06,045
Whatever stands in our way...

522
00:51:07,247 --> 00:51:08,372
we will defeat.

523
00:51:09,706 --> 00:51:12,496
Bran saw the Night King
and his army marching

524
00:51:12,497 --> 00:51:13,706
towards Eastwatch.

525
00:51:15,122 --> 00:51:16,664
Bad things are coming.
