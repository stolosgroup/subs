1
00:00:00,698 --> 00:00:01,897
Does it ever end?

2
00:00:02,037 --> 00:00:04,363
This is further east
<i>than I've ever been.</i>

3
00:00:09,801 --> 00:00:12,869
May I present my wife
Margaery of House Tyrell?

4
00:00:12,904 --> 00:00:14,805
You are very welcome
here, Lady Stark.

5
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:17,574
If Robb Stark wants a pact with us,
he should come himself.

6
00:00:17,608 --> 00:00:20,243
My son is fighting a war,

7
00:00:20,277 --> 00:00:22,011
<i>not playing at one.</i>

8
00:00:22,046 --> 00:00:24,580
I cannot defeat
my brother in the field.

9
00:00:24,614 --> 00:00:27,216
You must give yourself
to the Lord of Light.

10
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:29,551
I've said the words,
damn you.

11
00:00:29,585 --> 00:00:32,321
I will give you a son.

12
00:00:32,367 --> 00:00:34,569
We've come to
a dangerous place.

13
00:00:34,603 --> 00:00:38,106
My sister wants to hurt me.
She can't know about you.

14
00:00:38,141 --> 00:00:39,191
Who are you?

15
00:00:39,216 --> 00:00:41,243
I'm Shae, My Lady.
Your new handmaiden.

16
00:00:41,278 --> 00:00:43,313
I didn't know I needed
a new handmaiden.

17
00:00:43,347 --> 00:00:46,417
<i>You fought bravely today,</i>
<i>Lady Brienne.</i>

18
00:00:46,451 --> 00:00:49,320
I fought for my king. Soon I'll
fight for him on the battlefield.

19
00:00:49,354 --> 00:00:51,188
Die for him
if I must.

20
00:00:58,764 --> 00:01:00,464
You told the Queen
about my plans

21
00:01:00,498 --> 00:01:02,533
- to send Myrcella to Dorne.
- Never!

22
00:01:02,567 --> 00:01:04,401
Throw him in one
of the black cells.

23
00:01:04,435 --> 00:01:06,103
Myrcella is
my only daughter.

24
00:01:06,137 --> 00:01:08,571
Do you really think I'll let you
sell her like a common whore?

25
00:01:08,606 --> 00:01:10,507
- It's done, Cersei.
- No.

26
00:01:10,541 --> 00:01:13,377
- You cannot stop it.
- No!

27
00:01:13,412 --> 00:01:14,558
Not tonight.

28
00:01:14,583 --> 00:01:16,613
There's another Tyrell
who requires your attention.

29
00:01:18,184 --> 00:01:19,080
I'm sorry.

30
00:01:19,105 --> 00:01:20,680
Do you want my brother
to come in and help?

31
00:01:20,687 --> 00:01:22,271
I don't know what
you're talking about.

32
00:01:22,296 --> 00:01:22,955
There's no need

33
00:01:22,956 --> 00:01:25,625
for us to play games.
Save your lies for court.

34
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,060
You're going to need
a lot of them.

35
00:01:27,094 --> 00:01:29,463
My brother Jaime rots
in a northern stockade.

36
00:01:29,497 --> 00:01:32,067
Robb Stark will never
release the Kingslayer.

37
00:01:32,101 --> 00:01:33,278
But his mother might.

38
00:01:33,303 --> 00:01:35,492
How would you like to see
your beloved Cat again?

39
00:01:35,839 --> 00:01:38,675
<i>- Outside!</i>
- Come here, boy!

40
00:01:38,709 --> 00:01:42,012
Sweet boy, help us.
Give it to me.

41
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,154
<i>Round up any survivors.</i>

42
00:01:50,188 --> 00:01:52,357
We'll take them back
to Harrenhal.

43
00:01:52,391 --> 00:01:54,326
We're looking for
a bastard named Gendry.

44
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,896
You want Gendry?
You already got him.

45
00:02:07,598 --> 00:02:11,598

47
00:03:59,402 --> 00:04:01,771
It's got to be the Mountain.
He's the biggest.

48
00:04:01,805 --> 00:04:04,173
- He's the strongest.
- Bulls are bigger than lions.

49
00:04:04,207 --> 00:04:06,075
Doesn't mean I'd pick
a bull in a fight.

50
00:04:06,109 --> 00:04:09,211
If the bull had fangs
and claws, I would.

51
00:04:09,246 --> 00:04:12,948
Right, the Mountain
or our man Jaime.

52
00:04:12,982 --> 00:04:15,484
If he ever gets out.

53
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,119
Loras Tyrell?

54
00:04:17,154 --> 00:04:20,323
Loras Tyrell.
He's prettier than the queen.

55
00:04:20,358 --> 00:04:21,898
I don't care about pretty.

56
00:04:21,923 --> 00:04:23,393
He's better with a sword
than any of them.

57
00:04:23,395 --> 00:04:25,696
How good could he be?

58
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:28,165
He's been stabbing
Renly Baratheon for years,

59
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,768
and Renly ain't dead.

60
00:04:39,178 --> 00:04:41,546
The horses seem
a little spooked to you?

61
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,481
They're horses.

62
00:04:43,516 --> 00:04:45,617
They get spooked
by their own shadows.

63
00:04:45,651 --> 00:04:49,754
Shh.

64
00:04:49,788 --> 00:04:51,856
Do you hear that?

65
00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:54,692
No.

66
00:04:54,727 --> 00:04:56,428
There's something
out there.

67
00:05:19,185 --> 00:05:21,987
Oh.

68
00:05:22,022 --> 00:05:24,423
Oh, you're a right
little prick.

69
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:26,125
You should see
your face.

70
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,561
I swear you
pissed yourself.

71
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:30,629
"Oh, who goes there?
Ahh!"

72
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:32,564
There is something out there.

73
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:34,967
Yeah, don't even try me.

74
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,236
- Rennick.
- Do you think I'm an idiot?

75
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:40,872
Rennick!

76
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:50,349
<i>- King in the North!</i>
<i>- The King in the North!</i>

77
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:13,104
<i>Five Lannisters dead</i>
<i>for every one of ours.</i>

78
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:14,673
They're dead.
Take everything they've got.

79
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:16,841
<i>We've nowhere to keep</i>
<i>all these prisoners.</i>

80
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:19,377
Barely enough food
to feed our own.

81
00:06:19,411 --> 00:06:21,512
We're not executing
prisoners, Lord Bolton.

82
00:06:21,546 --> 00:06:23,113
Of course, Your Grace.

83
00:06:23,148 --> 00:06:25,916
The officers
will be useful.

84
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:29,085
Some of them may be privy
to Tywin Lannister's plans.

85
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:30,854
I doubt it.

86
00:06:30,888 --> 00:06:32,789
<i>Well, we'll learn</i>
<i>soon enough.</i>

87
00:06:32,824 --> 00:06:36,727
In my family we say,
"A naked man has few secrets.

88
00:06:36,762 --> 00:06:38,663
A flayed man none."

89
00:06:38,697 --> 00:06:40,665
My father outlawed
flaying in the North.

90
00:06:40,699 --> 00:06:43,902
- We're not in the North.
- We're not torturing them.

91
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:45,871
The high road's very pretty,

92
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:48,673
but you'll have a hard time
marching your army down it.

93
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:51,476
The Lannisters hold
prisoners of their own.

94
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:54,679
I won't give them an excuse
to abuse my sisters.

95
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:56,815
<i>No, no, don't! Don't!</i>

96
00:06:56,849 --> 00:06:58,550
<i>- Shh, shh.</i>
<i>- Please!</i>

97
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:01,185
Shh.

98
00:07:02,821 --> 00:07:04,821
The rot's set in.

99
00:07:04,856 --> 00:07:07,324
No, don't!
No, don't!

100
00:07:07,358 --> 00:07:10,060
- Shh.
- Please, don't!

101
00:07:10,094 --> 00:07:12,128
It'll get better.
It doesn't even hurt.

102
00:07:12,163 --> 00:07:15,299
The rot will spread.
If we don't take the foot now--

103
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:17,467
No, you can't!

104
00:07:20,538 --> 00:07:22,205
Ser! Please, Ser.

105
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,041
- I can't lose--
- You'll die if she does it.

106
00:07:24,075 --> 00:07:25,910
I don't want to be
a cripple, please.

107
00:07:25,944 --> 00:07:29,179
Surely one of our men needs your
attention more than this cub.

108
00:07:29,214 --> 00:07:31,048
Your men are not
my men, My Lord.

109
00:07:31,082 --> 00:07:33,984
Put this in your mouth and lie down.
You don't want to watch.

110
00:07:34,018 --> 00:07:36,887
- No! You can't!
- Bite on it.

111
00:07:36,921 --> 00:07:38,956
It's better than biting
your own tongue, believe me.

112
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:16,027
- What's your name?
- Talisa.

113
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:18,063
<i>Your last name?</i>

114
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:20,332
You want to know what side
my family fights on?

115
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:22,800
You know my family name.
You have me at a disadvantage.

116
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:25,636
That boy lost his foot
on your orders.

117
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:27,772
They killed my father.

118
00:08:27,806 --> 00:08:30,641
- That boy did?
- The family he fights for.

119
00:08:30,675 --> 00:08:33,677
Do you think he's friends
with King Joffrey?

120
00:08:33,711 --> 00:08:36,246
<i>He's a fisherman's son</i>
<i>that grew up near Lannisport.</i>

121
00:08:36,281 --> 00:08:37,496
He probably never held a spear

122
00:08:37,521 --> 00:08:39,411
before they shoved one in his
hands a few months ago.

123
00:08:39,417 --> 00:08:41,652
I have no hatred
for the lad.

124
00:08:43,521 --> 00:08:45,255
That should help
his foot grow back.

125
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,895
You'd have us surrender,
end all this bloodshed.

126
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:55,232
I understand.
The country would be at peace

127
00:08:55,267 --> 00:08:57,205
and life would be just
under the righteous hand

128
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:58,530
of good King Joffrey.

129
00:08:58,537 --> 00:09:01,272
- You're going to kill Joffrey?
- If the Gods give me strength.

130
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:04,743
- And then what?
- I don't know.

131
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:06,712
We'll go back
to Winterfell.

132
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:08,747
I have no desire to sit
on the Iron Throne.

133
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:11,383
So who will?

134
00:09:11,418 --> 00:09:13,451
I don't know.

135
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:15,421
You're fighting
to overthrow a king,

136
00:09:15,455 --> 00:09:17,223
and yet you have no plan
for what comes after?

137
00:09:17,257 --> 00:09:19,858
First we have
to win the war.

138
00:09:25,098 --> 00:09:27,065
You never told me
where you're from.

139
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:29,467
- Volantis.
- Volantis?

140
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:32,237
You're far from home.

141
00:09:32,271 --> 00:09:34,539
The boy was lucky
you were here.

142
00:09:34,573 --> 00:09:37,641
He was unlucky
that you were.

143
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:48,551
You're here to answer for your
brother's latest treasons.

144
00:09:48,585 --> 00:09:50,286
Your Grace,

145
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,622
whatever my traitor brother
has done, I had no part.

146
00:09:53,657 --> 00:09:55,124
You know that.
I beg you--

147
00:09:55,158 --> 00:09:57,193
Ser Lancel, tell her
of this outrage.

148
00:09:57,227 --> 00:09:59,495
<i>Using some vile sorcery,</i>

149
00:09:59,529 --> 00:10:02,064
your brother fell on Stafford Lannister
with an army of wolves.

150
00:10:02,849 --> 00:10:05,100
Thousands of good men
were butchered.

151
00:10:05,101 --> 00:10:07,639
After the slaughter,
the northmen feasted on

152
00:10:07,664 --> 00:10:09,346
the flesh of the slain.

153
00:10:11,408 --> 00:10:13,944
Killing you would send
your brother a message.

154
00:10:17,515 --> 00:10:19,984
But my mother insists
on keeping you alive.

155
00:10:20,018 --> 00:10:21,786
Stand.

156
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:25,181
So we'll have to send
your brother

157
00:10:25,206 --> 00:10:27,206
a message some other way.

158
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:30,562
Meryn.

159
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:36,200
Leave her face.

160
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:37,768
I like her pretty.

161
00:10:44,856 --> 00:10:47,158
Meryn, My Lady
is overdressed.

162
00:10:47,646 --> 00:10:49,780
Unburden her.

163
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:57,288
If you want Robb Stark
to hear us,

164
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,458
we're going to have
to speak louder.

165
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,496
<i>What is the meaning</i>
<i>of this?</i>

166
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:14,373
What kind of knight
beats a helpless girl?

167
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:16,575
The kind who serves
his king, Imp.

168
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:18,043
Careful, now. We don't want

169
00:11:18,068 --> 00:11:19,878
to get blood all over your
pretty white cloak.

170
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:22,981
Someone get the girl something
to cover herself with.

171
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:25,216
She is to be your queen.

172
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:27,084
Have you no regard
for her honor?

173
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:29,286
<i>- I'm punishing her.</i>
<i>- For what crimes?</i>

174
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:31,589
<i>She did not fight her</i>
<i>brother's battle, you half-wit.</i>

175
00:11:31,623 --> 00:11:35,192
You can't talk to me like that.
The king can do as he likes!

176
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:37,094
The Mad King
did as he liked.

177
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:40,565
Has your Uncle Jaime ever told
you what happened to him?

178
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,535
No one threatens His Grace
in the presence of the Kingsguard.

179
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:45,605
I'm not threatening
the King, Ser.

180
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:47,206
I am educating my nephew.

181
00:11:47,241 --> 00:11:50,577
Bronn, the next time
Ser Meryn speaks, kill him.

182
00:11:51,813 --> 00:11:54,948
That was a threat.
See the difference?

183
00:12:16,672 --> 00:12:20,241
<i>I apologize for</i>
<i>my nephew's behavior.</i>

184
00:12:21,811 --> 00:12:23,207
Tell me the truth.

185
00:12:23,232 --> 00:12:25,232
Do you want an end
to this engagement?

186
00:12:25,248 --> 00:12:29,252
I am loyal to King Joffrey,
my one true love.

187
00:12:32,389 --> 00:12:37,593
Lady Stark, you may
survive us yet.

188
00:12:41,297 --> 00:12:43,031
The little king's
backed up.

189
00:12:43,065 --> 00:12:46,434
Clogged from balls
to brains.

190
00:12:46,469 --> 00:12:49,170
You think dipping his wick
will cure what ails him?

191
00:12:49,205 --> 00:12:52,173
There's no cure
for being a cunt.

192
00:12:52,207 --> 00:12:54,475
But the boy's at that age.

193
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:58,212
And he's got nothing to do all
day but pick wings off flies.

194
00:12:58,247 --> 00:13:00,782
Couldn't hurt to get
some of the poison out.

195
00:13:08,491 --> 00:13:10,525
What are you
doing here, dog?

196
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,894
Your uncle left
your nameday present

197
00:13:12,929 --> 00:13:15,396
and asked me to see
that you got it.

198
00:13:17,967 --> 00:13:19,968
And?

199
00:13:20,002 --> 00:13:22,103
What is it?

200
00:13:22,137 --> 00:13:24,573
Look inside,
Your Grace.

201
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,415
Your Grace.

202
00:13:33,449 --> 00:13:36,319
- Happy nameday, Your Grace.
- My nameday has passed.

203
00:13:36,353 --> 00:13:39,155
We won't tell
if you won't.

204
00:13:42,293 --> 00:13:44,428
No.

205
00:13:44,462 --> 00:13:46,230
Her.

206
00:13:48,634 --> 00:13:50,635
Touch her.

207
00:14:12,323 --> 00:14:13,990
Could you hit her?

208
00:14:27,239 --> 00:14:28,907
My uncle sent you?

209
00:14:28,941 --> 00:14:31,076
Yes, Your Grace.

210
00:14:31,111 --> 00:14:32,445
He chose us himself.

211
00:14:32,479 --> 00:14:34,246
Hmm.

212
00:14:43,056 --> 00:14:45,325
Use this.

213
00:14:57,905 --> 00:14:59,539
Harder.

214
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:08,047
I said harder.

215
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:12,585
He'd want me to get
his money's worth.

216
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:58,998
Your Grace, too much pain
will spoil the pleasure.

217
00:16:01,201 --> 00:16:03,802
<i>Please, please,</i>

218
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,674
please, Your Grace.

219
00:16:11,576 --> 00:16:13,744
Your Grace,
if your uncle finds out--

220
00:16:13,778 --> 00:16:15,613
Oh, I want him
to find out.

221
00:16:15,647 --> 00:16:18,916
You will bring her to his
chambers when you're finished

222
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:21,151
and show him
what you've done.

223
00:16:22,954 --> 00:16:25,355
Or the same thing
will happen to you.

224
00:16:31,263 --> 00:16:33,630
Begin.

225
00:16:41,974 --> 00:16:43,375
Harder!

226
00:16:54,519 --> 00:16:58,122
Well, if it isn't
my favorite whoremonger.

227
00:16:58,157 --> 00:17:01,058
Pray I haven't kept
you waiting long.

228
00:17:03,161 --> 00:17:05,295
Your Grace.

229
00:17:08,633 --> 00:17:11,935
Now you do the Lannisters'
bidding, is that it?

230
00:17:11,969 --> 00:17:15,171
Tell me, was my brother's
body even cold

231
00:17:15,206 --> 00:17:17,373
before you secured
your newest patron?

232
00:17:17,408 --> 00:17:19,776
I'm a practical man.

233
00:17:21,078 --> 00:17:23,079
Just not a loyal one.

234
00:17:23,113 --> 00:17:25,048
<i>And who would you have</i>
<i>me be loyal to?</i>

235
00:17:25,082 --> 00:17:27,016
Your brother's corpse?

236
00:17:29,152 --> 00:17:32,220
I don't like you,
Lord Baelish.

237
00:17:32,255 --> 00:17:34,589
I don't like your face.

238
00:17:34,624 --> 00:17:38,026
I don't like the words that come
oozing out of your mouth.

239
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:41,630
I don't want you in my tent
one minute more than necessary.

240
00:17:41,665 --> 00:17:44,866
So tell me,
why are you here?

241
00:17:45,868 --> 00:17:47,870
<i>You can trust Brienne.</i>

242
00:17:47,904 --> 00:17:50,405
Her loyalty comes
without charge.

243
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:55,610
You still have many friends
at court, Your Grace,

244
00:17:55,645 --> 00:17:59,048
many who believe
Ned Stark erred

245
00:17:59,082 --> 00:18:01,217
by not supporting
your claim.

246
00:18:02,653 --> 00:18:05,388
Now I understand.

247
00:18:05,423 --> 00:18:07,324
You know I have
the numbers.

248
00:18:07,358 --> 00:18:10,127
You know I'm marching
on King's Landing.

249
00:18:10,161 --> 00:18:13,329
When I take the throne,
you hope to retain your position.

250
00:18:14,832 --> 00:18:16,766
And your head.

251
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,768
I would give priority
to my head.

252
00:18:19,802 --> 00:18:22,270
<i>I understand that</i>
<i>you don't like me,</i>

253
00:18:22,305 --> 00:18:24,639
and while that
saddens me greatly,

254
00:18:24,673 --> 00:18:27,308
I did not come here today
seeking your affection.

255
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:30,844
<i>When you march</i>
<i>on King's Landing,</i>

256
00:18:30,878 --> 00:18:34,281
you may find yourself facing
a protracted siege or...

257
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:37,518
open gates.

258
00:18:55,203 --> 00:18:56,937
Your Grace.

259
00:18:56,972 --> 00:18:59,907
Lord Baelish.

260
00:18:59,941 --> 00:19:03,077
All of these tents
look the same to me.

261
00:19:03,111 --> 00:19:05,446
- Would you be so kind--
- It would be my pleasure.

262
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,315
It took me weeks to learn
way around the camp.

263
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:11,385
Twice I walked in on officers
in stages of undress.

264
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:14,088
And the moment I learn
which tent is mine,

265
00:19:14,122 --> 00:19:15,824
we're on the move again.

266
00:19:15,858 --> 00:19:17,491
Your tent?

267
00:19:17,526 --> 00:19:19,661
Not our tent?

268
00:19:19,695 --> 00:19:22,063
The King snores, perhaps?

269
00:19:22,098 --> 00:19:25,200
Or simply prefers
solitude?

270
00:19:25,234 --> 00:19:28,104
Pressures of command,
no doubt.

271
00:19:28,138 --> 00:19:30,840
Four kings vying
for the throne.

272
00:19:30,874 --> 00:19:33,242
I am not tutored
in warfare,

273
00:19:33,277 --> 00:19:36,946
but basic arithmetic favors the
side with the greater numbers.

274
00:19:36,948 --> 00:19:38,585
If war were arithmetic,

275
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:40,764
the mathematicians
would rule the world.

276
00:19:42,152 --> 00:19:45,088
But I did notice your brother
entering His Grace's tent the just now.

277
00:19:45,122 --> 00:19:47,323
The place of a Kingsguard
is by the King's side.

278
00:19:47,358 --> 00:19:49,392
And on the night
of the your wedding,

279
00:19:49,427 --> 00:19:52,162
who was by
the King's side then?

280
00:19:52,196 --> 00:19:54,398
You seem quite interested
in our marriage.

281
00:19:54,432 --> 00:19:57,001
Your marriage
is quite interesting...

282
00:19:57,035 --> 00:20:00,138
Not only to me,
but to the realm.

283
00:20:00,172 --> 00:20:03,275
The marriage of a wealthy girl
always breeds interest,

284
00:20:03,309 --> 00:20:05,444
if nothing else.

285
00:20:05,478 --> 00:20:07,379
You've never married,
have you?

286
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:11,784
I've been unlucky
in my affections, sadly.

287
00:20:11,818 --> 00:20:14,220
That is sad.

288
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:16,021
Though perhaps
it's for the best.

289
00:20:16,055 --> 00:20:18,323
The whole notion of marriage
seems to confuse you,

290
00:20:18,358 --> 00:20:20,559
so allow me to explain.

291
00:20:20,593 --> 00:20:25,030
My husband is my King,
and my King is my husband.

292
00:20:25,064 --> 00:20:28,600
Here is your tent,
Lord Baelish. Good night.

293
00:21:23,557 --> 00:21:25,993
What do you know
of this place?

294
00:21:26,027 --> 00:21:28,162
Only that the desert
around their walls

295
00:21:28,196 --> 00:21:30,331
is called
the Garden of Bones.

296
00:21:32,034 --> 00:21:34,935
Every time the Qartheen
shut their gates on a traveler,

297
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:37,204
the garden grows.

298
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:52,551
- Go on!
- You, keep moving!

299
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:02,195
<i>Bring her about!</i>

300
00:22:02,229 --> 00:22:05,198
What kind of fire
melts stone?

301
00:22:05,232 --> 00:22:07,133
Dragon fire.

302
00:22:07,168 --> 00:22:08,902
There's dragons here?

303
00:22:08,936 --> 00:22:11,538
No, all the dragons
are dead.

304
00:22:11,573 --> 00:22:13,774
What's that smell?

305
00:22:15,444 --> 00:22:18,179
Dead people.

306
00:22:18,214 --> 00:22:20,349
Move.

307
00:22:28,626 --> 00:22:30,460
<i>Please, please, no, no!</i>

308
00:22:37,167 --> 00:22:40,203
<i>No.</i>

309
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:52,715
<i>He's dead.</i>

310
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:55,918
He was my son.

311
00:22:57,788 --> 00:23:01,190
My sister
was three days ago.

312
00:23:01,225 --> 00:23:04,293
My husband,
the day before that.

313
00:23:05,262 --> 00:23:07,563
They take someone
every day?

314
00:23:09,867 --> 00:23:11,968
Does anyone live?

315
00:23:35,426 --> 00:23:37,894
Joffrey.

316
00:23:37,928 --> 00:23:39,895
Cersei.

317
00:23:39,929 --> 00:23:41,697
Ilyn Payne.

318
00:23:41,731 --> 00:23:43,632
The Hound.

319
00:23:43,666 --> 00:23:46,034
Joffrey.

320
00:23:46,068 --> 00:23:48,736
Cersei.

321
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:50,705
Ilyn Payne.

322
00:23:50,739 --> 00:23:52,473
The Hound.

323
00:23:52,507 --> 00:23:55,709
Joffrey. Cersei.

324
00:23:55,744 --> 00:23:58,779
Ilyn Payne.
The Hound.

325
00:24:02,884 --> 00:24:04,351
How dare you?

326
00:24:04,386 --> 00:24:06,253
You may have heard
false reports.

327
00:24:06,288 --> 00:24:08,790
- You betrayed Ned.
- <i>Betrayed?</i>

328
00:24:08,824 --> 00:24:10,758
I wanted him to serve
as Protector of the Realm.

329
00:24:10,793 --> 00:24:12,327
I begged him
to seize the moment.

330
00:24:12,361 --> 00:24:16,465
I trusted you.
My husband trusted you.

331
00:24:16,499 --> 00:24:19,768
And you repaid our faith
with treachery.

332
00:24:19,802 --> 00:24:21,103
- No, My Lady.
- Get out!

333
00:24:21,137 --> 00:24:23,306
Cat, I've--

334
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:25,975
I've loved you
since I was a boy.

335
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:29,913
It seems to me that fate
has given us this chance--

336
00:24:29,948 --> 00:24:33,349
Have you lost your mind?
Get out!

337
00:24:46,628 --> 00:24:48,963
Do you want to see
your girls again?

338
00:24:51,032 --> 00:24:54,802
Sansa, more beautiful
than ever.

339
00:24:54,837 --> 00:24:58,874
And Arya,
just as wild as ever.

340
00:24:58,908 --> 00:25:01,110
You have Arya, too?

341
00:25:01,144 --> 00:25:05,214
Both girls are healthy
and safe...

342
00:25:05,249 --> 00:25:08,251
<i>for now.</i>

343
00:25:08,285 --> 00:25:12,088
But you know the Queen
and you know Joffrey.

344
00:25:12,123 --> 00:25:15,057
I fear for
their longevity

345
00:25:15,092 --> 00:25:17,293
if they remain
in the capital.

346
00:25:38,882 --> 00:25:40,549
What do you want?

347
00:25:42,152 --> 00:25:45,222
The Lannisters will trade your
daughters for the Kingslayer.

348
00:25:45,256 --> 00:25:46,823
Of course they will.

349
00:25:46,858 --> 00:25:49,527
Jaime Lannister
for two girls?

350
00:25:49,561 --> 00:25:51,129
Robb will never agree
to those terms.

351
00:25:51,163 --> 00:25:53,465
I'm not bringing
these terms to him.

352
00:25:53,499 --> 00:25:55,366
I'm bringing them
to you.

353
00:25:55,401 --> 00:25:58,002
You think I'd keep
secrets from my son?

354
00:25:58,037 --> 00:26:00,939
Robb has surprised them all
with his skills in battle,

355
00:26:00,973 --> 00:26:02,907
but he's not a mother.

356
00:26:02,942 --> 00:26:05,776
<i>Consider it, Cat.</i>

357
00:26:05,811 --> 00:26:08,546
<i>You may not get</i>
<i>another chance.</i>

358
00:26:12,651 --> 00:26:15,486
- I've brought you a gift.
- I don't want your gifts.

359
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,823
A token of Tyrion
Lannister's goodwill.

360
00:26:18,857 --> 00:26:22,994
He wants you to understand
that this exchange of prisoners

361
00:26:23,028 --> 00:26:25,130
is offered in good faith.

362
00:26:25,164 --> 00:26:27,098
Good faith?

363
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:32,904
What's this?

364
00:27:02,367 --> 00:27:05,536
Your husband was
an honorable man.

365
00:27:05,571 --> 00:27:09,274
He should rest beside his family
in the crypts beneath Winterfell.

366
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:16,081
- You may not believe--
- Get out.

367
00:27:47,946 --> 00:27:51,616
<i>Get up, you dogs!</i>

368
00:28:02,127 --> 00:28:05,428
That's him,
the one who picks.

369
00:28:05,463 --> 00:28:07,597
The Mountain.

370
00:28:10,234 --> 00:28:12,234
What are you doing?

371
00:28:12,268 --> 00:28:14,403
He told me he stares
at him every day.

372
00:28:14,437 --> 00:28:16,906
That's why he
doesn't get picked.

373
00:28:42,299 --> 00:28:44,167
You.

374
00:28:44,202 --> 00:28:46,937
<i>Move, boy!</i>

375
00:28:46,972 --> 00:28:49,440
Move!

376
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:10,095
<i>Is there gold and silver</i>
<i>in the village?</i>

377
00:29:10,129 --> 00:29:12,631
- I don't know.
- <i>Gems?</i>

378
00:29:12,665 --> 00:29:14,866
I didn't see any.

379
00:29:14,901 --> 00:29:17,269
- Where is the Brotherhood?
- I don't know.

380
00:29:33,086 --> 00:29:35,954
<i>- Where is the Brotherhood?</i>
- I don't know. Please.

381
00:29:35,988 --> 00:29:38,790
- Where is the Brotherhood?
- I don't know.

382
00:29:44,196 --> 00:29:46,164
Which of the villagers
aided them?

383
00:29:46,198 --> 00:29:48,766
- I don't know.
- Who?

384
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,002
I--

385
00:29:53,405 --> 00:29:56,374
- Who?
- I never saw.

386
00:29:56,408 --> 00:29:58,042
- Who?
- I never saw.

387
00:29:58,076 --> 00:30:01,179
Please. Please, stop.
Please, it's starting to--

388
00:30:01,213 --> 00:30:04,516
- <i>Who?</i>
- I didn't see anyone help him.

389
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:06,952
Take it off! Take it off!

390
00:30:06,986 --> 00:30:09,353
- <i>Who helped him?</i>
- Ganes the butcher

391
00:30:09,388 --> 00:30:11,222
- and his son.
- That's better.

392
00:30:11,256 --> 00:30:14,492
- <i>You've been very helpful.</i>
- No, stop, please!

393
00:30:14,526 --> 00:30:16,927
<i>What are you doing?</i>
<i>Please, stop!</i>

394
00:30:16,961 --> 00:30:19,463
<i>Please, stop!</i>
<i>No! No!</i>

395
00:30:19,497 --> 00:30:21,698
I told you everything!
No!

396
00:30:21,732 --> 00:30:25,035
No!

397
00:30:25,069 --> 00:30:28,304
Joffrey.

398
00:30:28,339 --> 00:30:30,440
Cersei.

399
00:30:30,474 --> 00:30:32,943
Ilyn Payne.
The Hound.

400
00:30:32,977 --> 00:30:35,712
<i>Please, Polliver.</i>
<i>Some food.</i>

401
00:30:35,747 --> 00:30:38,482
Just a crust of bread.

402
00:30:42,788 --> 00:30:44,756
Polliver.

403
00:30:44,791 --> 00:30:47,059
The Mountain.

404
00:31:04,076 --> 00:31:07,145
Lady Stark, I had not thought
to find you in the Stormlands.

405
00:31:07,179 --> 00:31:10,748
I had not thought
to be here, Lord Stannis.

406
00:31:10,782 --> 00:31:14,151
- Can that truly be you?
- Who else might it be?

407
00:31:14,186 --> 00:31:16,921
When I saw your standard,
I couldn't be sure.

408
00:31:16,955 --> 00:31:19,490
- Whose banner is that?
- My own.

409
00:31:19,525 --> 00:31:22,093
I suppose if we used
the same one,

410
00:31:22,128 --> 00:31:24,896
the battle would be
terribly confusing.

411
00:31:24,931 --> 00:31:27,132
<i>Why is your stag</i>
<i>on fire?</i>

412
00:31:28,268 --> 00:31:30,002
The King has taken
for his sigil

413
00:31:30,036 --> 00:31:32,038
the fiery heart
of the Lord of Light.

414
00:31:32,072 --> 00:31:36,509
Ah, you must be this fire
priestess we hear so much about.

415
00:31:36,543 --> 00:31:38,745
<i>Mm, brother,</i>

416
00:31:38,779 --> 00:31:42,048
now I understand why you
found religion in your old age.

417
00:31:42,083 --> 00:31:43,517
Watch yourself, Renly.

418
00:31:43,551 --> 00:31:46,587
<i>No, no, I'm relieved.</i>

419
00:31:46,621 --> 00:31:48,789
I never really believed
you're a fanatic.

420
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:52,159
Charmless, rigid,
a bore, yes,

421
00:31:52,194 --> 00:31:53,995
but not a godly man.

422
00:31:56,432 --> 00:31:58,733
You should kneel
he's the Lord's chosen,

423
00:31:58,768 --> 00:32:01,103
<i>born amidst salt</i>
<i>and smoke.</i>

424
00:32:01,137 --> 00:32:03,305
Born amidst salt
and smoke?

425
00:32:03,339 --> 00:32:04,607
Is he a ham?

426
00:32:04,641 --> 00:32:06,576
<i>That's twice</i>
<i>I've warned you.</i>

427
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:08,511
Listen to yourselves.

428
00:32:08,545 --> 00:32:11,781
If you were sons of mine, I
would knock your heads together

429
00:32:11,816 --> 00:32:13,483
and lock you in a bedchamber
until you remembered

430
00:32:13,508 --> 00:32:15,118
that you were brothers.

431
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:17,820
It is strange to find you
beside my brother, Lady Stark.

432
00:32:17,854 --> 00:32:20,656
<i>Your husband was a supporter</i>
<i>of my claim.</i>

433
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:22,725
Lord Eddard's integrity
cost him his head.

434
00:32:22,759 --> 00:32:25,794
And you sit beside this pretender
and chastise me.

435
00:32:25,829 --> 00:32:27,496
We share a common enemy.

436
00:32:27,531 --> 00:32:31,233
The Iron Throne
is mine by right.

437
00:32:31,268 --> 00:32:34,703
All those that deny that
are my foes.

438
00:32:34,738 --> 00:32:37,973
The whole realm denies it,
from Dorne to the Wall.

439
00:32:38,008 --> 00:32:39,742
Old men deny it
with their death rattle

440
00:32:39,776 --> 00:32:42,645
and unborn children deny it
in their mother's wombs.

441
00:32:45,081 --> 00:32:46,882
No one wants you
for their King.

442
00:32:46,916 --> 00:32:50,118
<i>You never wanted</i>
<i>any friends, brother.</i>

443
00:32:50,186 --> 00:32:52,587
<i>But a man without friends</i>
<i>is a man without power.</i>

444
00:32:52,622 --> 00:32:56,157
For the sake of the mother
who bore us,

445
00:32:56,192 --> 00:32:58,560
I will give you this one night
to reconsider.

446
00:32:58,594 --> 00:33:01,196
Strike your banners,

447
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:03,831
come to me before dawn,

448
00:33:03,865 --> 00:33:06,767
and I will grant you
your old seat in the council.

449
00:33:07,936 --> 00:33:10,737
I'll even name you
my heir

450
00:33:10,772 --> 00:33:12,606
until a son
is born to me.

451
00:33:14,676 --> 00:33:16,944
Otherwise I shall
destroy you.

452
00:33:20,682 --> 00:33:22,383
Look across
those fields, brother.

453
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:25,053
<i>Can you see</i>
<i>all those banners?</i>

454
00:33:25,087 --> 00:33:27,823
You think a few bolts
of cloth will make you King?

455
00:33:27,857 --> 00:33:30,025
No.

456
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:33,196
The men holding those bolts
of cloth will make me King.

457
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:35,098
We shall see, Renly.

458
00:33:35,132 --> 00:33:37,868
Come the dawn,
we shall see.

459
00:33:37,902 --> 00:33:40,070
Look to your sins,
Lord Renly.

460
00:33:40,105 --> 00:33:42,606
The night is dark
and full of terrors.

461
00:33:48,146 --> 00:33:51,714
Would you believe
I loved him once?

462
00:34:12,103 --> 00:34:14,104
I thought we were welcome.

463
00:34:14,138 --> 00:34:17,007
If you heard a Dothraki horde
was approaching your city,

464
00:34:17,041 --> 00:34:19,075
you might do the same,
Khaleesi.

465
00:34:21,445 --> 00:34:23,479
Horde?

466
00:34:38,195 --> 00:34:40,229
My name is Daenerys--

467
00:34:40,264 --> 00:34:43,499
Daenerys Stormborn
of the House Targaryen.

468
00:34:43,534 --> 00:34:45,568
You know me, My Lord?

469
00:34:45,602 --> 00:34:48,238
Only by reputation,
Khaleesi.

470
00:34:48,272 --> 00:34:51,808
And I'm no lord,
merely a humble merchant.

471
00:34:52,911 --> 00:34:55,546
They call you
the Mother of Dragons.

472
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:57,548
And what should
I call you?

473
00:34:57,582 --> 00:34:59,150
Oh, my name is quite long

474
00:34:59,184 --> 00:35:01,753
and quite impossible
for foreigners to pronounce.

475
00:35:01,787 --> 00:35:05,391
I am simply a trader
of spices.

476
00:35:05,425 --> 00:35:08,761
But we are the Thirteen,

477
00:35:08,796 --> 00:35:12,132
charged with the governance
and protection of Qarth,

478
00:35:12,166 --> 00:35:15,869
the greatest city
that ever was or will be.

479
00:35:17,171 --> 00:35:19,704
The beauty of
Quarth is legendary--

480
00:35:19,729 --> 00:35:21,729
Qarth.

481
00:35:23,211 --> 00:35:24,811
Qarth.

482
00:35:24,846 --> 00:35:27,881
Might we see
the dragons?

483
00:35:32,487 --> 00:35:35,889
My friend,

484
00:35:35,924 --> 00:35:38,358
we have travelled
very far.

485
00:35:38,392 --> 00:35:40,893
<i>We have no food,</i>
<i>no water.</i>

486
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:43,395
Once I see my people fed,
I would be honored--

487
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:46,265
Forgive me,
Mother of Dragons,

488
00:35:46,299 --> 00:35:50,302
but no man alive has seen
a living dragon.

489
00:35:50,336 --> 00:35:52,504
Some of my more
skeptical friends

490
00:35:52,538 --> 00:35:55,974
refuse to believe
your children

491
00:35:56,008 --> 00:35:57,909
even exist.

492
00:35:57,944 --> 00:36:01,346
<i>All we ask is the chance</i>
<i>to see for ourselves.</i>

493
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:03,348
I am not a liar.

494
00:36:03,383 --> 00:36:05,417
Oh, I don't think you are.

495
00:36:05,451 --> 00:36:07,152
But as I've never
met you before,

496
00:36:07,186 --> 00:36:10,389
my opinion on the matter
is of limited value.

497
00:36:11,925 --> 00:36:14,360
Where I come from,

498
00:36:14,394 --> 00:36:16,862
guests are treated
with respect,

499
00:36:16,897 --> 00:36:20,199
not insulted
at the gates.

500
00:36:20,233 --> 00:36:22,734
Then perhaps you should
return to where you come from.

501
00:36:22,769 --> 00:36:24,970
We wish you well.

502
00:36:28,475 --> 00:36:30,376
What are you doing?

503
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:33,211
You promised
to receive me.

504
00:36:34,313 --> 00:36:35,714
We have received you.

505
00:36:35,748 --> 00:36:38,450
Here we are,
and here you are.

506
00:36:38,484 --> 00:36:42,388
If you do not let us in,
all of us will die.

507
00:36:42,422 --> 00:36:45,124
Which we shall
deeply regret.

508
00:36:45,158 --> 00:36:46,229
But Qarth did not become

509
00:36:46,254 --> 00:36:48,374
the greatest city that
ever was or will be

510
00:36:48,395 --> 00:36:52,065
by letting Dothraki savages
through its gates.

511
00:36:58,939 --> 00:37:01,174
Khaleesi, please
be careful.

512
00:37:04,011 --> 00:37:06,613
Thirteen!

513
00:37:06,647 --> 00:37:09,149
When my dragons are grown,

514
00:37:09,183 --> 00:37:12,285
we will take back
what was stolen from me

515
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,654
and destroy those
who have wronged me.

516
00:37:14,689 --> 00:37:17,157
We will lay waste
to armies

517
00:37:17,191 --> 00:37:19,892
and burn cities
to the ground.

518
00:37:19,927 --> 00:37:23,896
Turn us away and we will
burn you first.

519
00:37:23,931 --> 00:37:26,098
Ah.

520
00:37:26,133 --> 00:37:28,901
You are a true
Targaryen.

521
00:37:28,936 --> 00:37:32,071
Only, as you said
a moment ago,

522
00:37:32,105 --> 00:37:33,706
if we don't let you
into the city,

523
00:37:33,741 --> 00:37:36,242
you will all die.
And so...

524
00:37:36,276 --> 00:37:38,911
Retreating in fear
from a little girl

525
00:37:38,945 --> 00:37:41,113
is unbecoming
of the greatest city

526
00:37:41,147 --> 00:37:42,715
that ever was
or will be.

527
00:37:42,749 --> 00:37:46,286
The discussion is over,
Xaro Xhoan Daxos.

528
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,321
The Thirteen have spoken.

529
00:37:48,356 --> 00:37:51,091
I am one of the Thirteen

530
00:37:51,125 --> 00:37:53,560
and I am still speaking.

531
00:37:53,594 --> 00:37:55,929
The girl threatens to burn
our city to the ground

532
00:37:55,963 --> 00:37:59,132
and you would invite her in
for a cup of wine?

533
00:37:59,166 --> 00:38:01,234
She is the Mother
of Dragons.

534
00:38:01,268 --> 00:38:04,570
Do you expect her to watch
her people starve

535
00:38:04,604 --> 00:38:06,705
without breathing fire?

536
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:09,308
<i>I believe we can allow</i>
<i>a few Dothraki</i>

537
00:38:09,342 --> 00:38:11,910
<i>through our gates</i>
<i>without dooming our city.</i>

538
00:38:11,945 --> 00:38:15,248
<i>After all, here I am,</i>

539
00:38:15,282 --> 00:38:17,350
a savage from
the Summer Isles,

540
00:38:17,384 --> 00:38:19,253
and Qarth still stands.

541
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:22,189
Our decision is final.

542
00:38:22,224 --> 00:38:24,359
Very well.

543
00:38:26,629 --> 00:38:29,231
I invoke <i>Soumai.</i>

544
00:38:33,069 --> 00:38:35,736
<i>I will vouch for her,</i>
<i>her people,</i>

545
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:39,139
<i>and her dragons</i>
<i>in accordance with the law.</i>

546
00:38:45,146 --> 00:38:47,146
Be it on your head.

547
00:38:48,548 --> 00:38:51,516
Welcome to Qarth,
My Lady.

548
00:39:41,033 --> 00:39:43,435
<i>You.</i>

549
00:39:51,879 --> 00:39:54,313
Is there gold or silver
in the village?

550
00:39:54,347 --> 00:39:57,249
- I'm not from the village.
- Where is the Brotherhood?

551
00:39:58,218 --> 00:39:59,885
I don't know
what that is.

552
00:40:28,983 --> 00:40:33,453
<i>You two, take Lord Lannister's</i>
<i>things to his quarters.</i>

553
00:40:33,488 --> 00:40:35,088
What's this?

554
00:40:35,123 --> 00:40:37,791
We weren't expecting you
till tomorrow, Lord Tywin.

555
00:40:37,825 --> 00:40:40,461
Evidently not.

556
00:40:42,497 --> 00:40:44,298
Why are these prisoners
not in their cells?

557
00:40:44,332 --> 00:40:46,701
<i>Cells are overflowing,</i>
<i>My Lord.</i>

558
00:40:46,735 --> 00:40:48,336
<i>This lot won't be here long.</i>

559
00:40:48,370 --> 00:40:50,772
<i>Don't need</i>
<i>no permanent place.</i>

560
00:40:50,806 --> 00:40:53,809
After we interrogate 'em,
we usually just...

561
00:40:53,843 --> 00:40:58,180
Are we so well-manned
that we can afford to discard

562
00:40:58,215 --> 00:41:01,017
able young bodies
and skilled laborers?

563
00:41:10,562 --> 00:41:13,231
You,
do you have a trade?

564
00:41:14,167 --> 00:41:16,067
<i>Smith, My Lord.</i>

565
00:41:17,570 --> 00:41:19,938
What are you looking at?
Kneel!

566
00:41:21,507 --> 00:41:24,776
Kneel or I'll carve
your lungs out, boy.

567
00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:27,111
He'll do no such thing.

568
00:41:27,145 --> 00:41:30,848
This one's a girl,
you idiot,

569
00:41:30,882 --> 00:41:32,249
dressed as a boy.

570
00:41:32,283 --> 00:41:35,352
- Why?
- Safer to travel, My Lord.

571
00:41:35,386 --> 00:41:37,487
Smart.

572
00:41:37,521 --> 00:41:39,389
More than I can say
for this lot.

573
00:41:39,423 --> 00:41:42,092
Get these prisoners
to work.

574
00:41:42,126 --> 00:41:44,060
Bring the girl.

575
00:41:44,095 --> 00:41:46,162
I need a new
cupbearer.

576
00:41:46,197 --> 00:41:47,798
<i>My Lord.</i>

577
00:41:55,207 --> 00:41:57,208
Your visits
are too few, cousin.

578
00:41:57,243 --> 00:41:58,843
Her Grace,
the Queen Regent,

579
00:41:58,877 --> 00:42:01,246
commands you to release
Grand Maester Pycelle.

580
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:04,616
- Here's your warrant.
- So it is.

581
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:07,019
Will you take
a cup with me?

582
00:42:07,053 --> 00:42:09,522
I find that mulled wine
helps me sleep.

583
00:42:09,589 --> 00:42:11,557
<i>I am here</i>
<i>at Her Grace's behest,</i>

584
00:42:11,591 --> 00:42:13,759
not to drink
with you, Imp.

585
00:42:13,793 --> 00:42:16,662
If my sister was
so concerned for Pycelle,

586
00:42:16,696 --> 00:42:18,897
<i>I would have thought</i>
<i>she'd come herself.</i>

587
00:42:18,931 --> 00:42:20,965
Instead she sends you.

588
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,433
What am I to make
of that?

589
00:42:22,468 --> 00:42:24,502
<i>I don't care</i>
<i>what you make of it,</i>

590
00:42:24,536 --> 00:42:26,570
so long as you release
your prisoner immediately.

591
00:42:26,605 --> 00:42:30,708
And you've received these
instructions directly from Cersei?

592
00:42:30,742 --> 00:42:33,010
As I said several times.

593
00:42:33,045 --> 00:42:35,947
And you've waited this long
to deliver the information?

594
00:42:35,981 --> 00:42:38,181
When the Queen Regent
gives me a command, I carry

595
00:42:38,206 --> 00:42:40,206
it out without delay.

596
00:42:42,589 --> 00:42:45,257
Cersei must have
great trust in you,

597
00:42:45,291 --> 00:42:47,493
<i>allowing you</i>
<i>into her chamber</i>

598
00:42:47,527 --> 00:42:50,396
during the hour
of the wolf.

599
00:42:54,401 --> 00:42:57,203
The Queen Regent has a great
many responsibilities.

600
00:42:57,237 --> 00:42:58,838
She often works
from dusk till dawn.

601
00:42:58,872 --> 00:43:01,206
She must be very glad
to have you helping her

602
00:43:01,241 --> 00:43:03,575
from dusk till dawn.

603
00:43:03,609 --> 00:43:06,610
Ah, lavender oil.

604
00:43:06,645 --> 00:43:09,180
She always loved lavender oil,
even as a girl.

605
00:43:09,214 --> 00:43:10,848
I am a knight!

606
00:43:11,716 --> 00:43:13,651
An anointed knight, yes.

607
00:43:13,685 --> 00:43:16,254
Tell me, did Cersei
have you knighted

608
00:43:16,288 --> 00:43:19,858
before or after she took
you into her bed?

609
00:43:19,892 --> 00:43:22,528
What?
Nothing to say?

610
00:43:22,562 --> 00:43:24,463
No more warnings
for me, Ser?

611
00:43:24,498 --> 00:43:26,432
You will withdraw
these filthy accusations.

612
00:43:26,467 --> 00:43:28,034
Have you ever given
any thought

613
00:43:28,068 --> 00:43:29,969
to what King Joffrey
will have to say

614
00:43:30,004 --> 00:43:33,406
when he finds out you've
been bedding his mother?

615
00:43:36,977 --> 00:43:38,878
It's not my fault!

616
00:43:38,912 --> 00:43:41,580
Did she take you
against your will?

617
00:43:41,614 --> 00:43:43,615
Can you not defend
yourself, knight?

618
00:43:43,650 --> 00:43:46,885
Your own father, Lord Tywin,
when I was named the King's squire,

619
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:48,854
he told me to obey her
in everything.

620
00:43:48,888 --> 00:43:50,755
Did he tell you
to fuck her, too?

621
00:43:50,789 --> 00:43:54,025
I only meant
I did as I was bid.

622
00:43:54,059 --> 00:43:55,827
Hated every
moment of it,

623
00:43:55,862 --> 00:43:57,862
is that what you'll
have me believe?

624
00:43:57,897 --> 00:43:59,932
A high place in court,
a knighthood,

625
00:43:59,966 --> 00:44:02,201
my sister's legs spreading
open for you at night.

626
00:44:02,235 --> 00:44:04,570
Oh, yes, it must
have been terrible.

627
00:44:04,604 --> 00:44:06,606
Wait here. His Grace will want
to hear this.

628
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,909
Mercy!
Mercy, My Lord! I beg you.

629
00:44:08,943 --> 00:44:10,544
Save it for Joffrey.
He loves a good grovel.

630
00:44:10,578 --> 00:44:12,299
My Lord, it was
your sister's bidding--

631
00:44:12,324 --> 00:44:13,414
the Queen.

632
00:44:13,415 --> 00:44:15,282
I'll leave the city
at once, I swear.

633
00:44:15,317 --> 00:44:18,519
- No, I think not.
- My Lord?

634
00:44:18,553 --> 00:44:20,520
You heard me.

635
00:44:23,991 --> 00:44:25,599
My father told you
to obey my sister.

636
00:44:25,624 --> 00:44:27,060
Obey her.

637
00:44:27,061 --> 00:44:30,430
Stay close to her side.
Keep her trust.

638
00:44:30,464 --> 00:44:32,532
Pleasure her
whenever she requires.

639
00:44:32,566 --> 00:44:34,634
No one ever need know

640
00:44:34,668 --> 00:44:38,104
as long as you keep
faith with me.

641
00:44:39,239 --> 00:44:41,606
I want to know
what Cersei is doing,

642
00:44:41,641 --> 00:44:44,509
where she goes,
who she sees,

643
00:44:44,543 --> 00:44:46,944
what they talk of--
everything.

644
00:44:46,979 --> 00:44:48,979
And you will tell me.

645
00:44:49,014 --> 00:44:51,382
Yes, My Lord, I will.

646
00:44:51,416 --> 00:44:53,717
I swear it,
as you command.

647
00:44:56,988 --> 00:44:59,289
Oh, rise, rise.

648
00:44:59,324 --> 00:45:02,493
Let us drink to
our understanding.

649
00:45:02,527 --> 00:45:05,062
Oh, you don't have
a cup. Oh, well.

650
00:45:05,097 --> 00:45:08,166
Smile, cousin. My sister
is a beautiful woman.

651
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:09,834
And it's all for
the good of the realm.

652
00:45:09,868 --> 00:45:12,470
Go back and tell her
that I beg her forgiveness,

653
00:45:12,504 --> 00:45:14,572
that I want no more
conflict between us

654
00:45:14,606 --> 00:45:16,350
and that henceforth

655
00:45:16,375 --> 00:45:18,343
I shall do nothing
without her consent.

656
00:45:18,344 --> 00:45:19,644
But her demands.

657
00:45:19,678 --> 00:45:22,313
Oh, I'll give her Pycelle.

658
00:45:22,348 --> 00:45:24,582
- You will?
- Yes, I'll release him in the morning.

659
00:45:24,617 --> 00:45:26,551
<i>Cersei can keep him</i>
<i>as a pet if she wants,</i>

660
00:45:26,585 --> 00:45:28,586
<i>but I will not have him</i>
<i>on the council.</i>

661
00:45:28,621 --> 00:45:31,456
I could swear that I had not
harmed a single hair on his head,

662
00:45:31,490 --> 00:45:34,993
but that would not,
strictly speaking, be true.

663
00:45:45,605 --> 00:45:49,273
<i>Stay within</i>
<i>one table length.</i>

664
00:45:53,946 --> 00:45:56,247
Your Grace.

665
00:46:00,786 --> 00:46:03,120
Do your knucklebones
bring you luck?

666
00:46:05,990 --> 00:46:09,025
Well, life's been good since you
hacked them off, Your Grace.

667
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:11,461
And it's four less
fingernails to clean.

668
00:46:11,496 --> 00:46:14,030
- Fewer.
- Pardon?

669
00:46:15,032 --> 00:46:17,000
Four fewer
fingernails to clean.

670
00:46:17,034 --> 00:46:20,370
Never understood
why you had to wear them.

671
00:46:20,404 --> 00:46:23,373
It reminds me of where I
come from and where I am now.

672
00:46:24,809 --> 00:46:26,444
It reminds me
of your justice.

673
00:46:26,478 --> 00:46:27,979
It was an honest
punishment

674
00:46:28,013 --> 00:46:29,548
and you were good
with the cleaver.

675
00:46:29,582 --> 00:46:32,250
You were a hero
and a smuggler.

676
00:46:32,285 --> 00:46:35,720
A good act does not
wash out the bad,

677
00:46:35,754 --> 00:46:38,622
nor a bad the good.

678
00:46:38,657 --> 00:46:41,125
A lesson I've tried
to teach my son.

679
00:46:41,159 --> 00:46:43,260
- Does he listen?
- To me?

680
00:46:43,295 --> 00:46:45,963
Gods, no.

681
00:46:45,997 --> 00:46:48,765
But if your red woman told him
to leap from the crow's nest--

682
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:51,101
She has a name.

683
00:46:53,904 --> 00:46:56,506
I trust you've not forgotten
your smuggler's tricks.

684
00:46:58,810 --> 00:47:00,845
I've lived within
the law for 17--

685
00:47:00,879 --> 00:47:03,280
I want you to be
a smuggler this time.

686
00:47:03,315 --> 00:47:05,883
Any shore, any night.

687
00:47:05,918 --> 00:47:07,652
What am I bringing
ashore?

688
00:47:07,687 --> 00:47:09,521
The red woman.

689
00:47:11,224 --> 00:47:13,392
No one must know
what you do

690
00:47:13,426 --> 00:47:15,027
and we'll not speak
of this again.

691
00:47:15,062 --> 00:47:18,597
I am true to Your Grace
and always will be,

692
00:47:18,632 --> 00:47:21,600
but surely there are
other ways, cleaner ways.

693
00:47:21,635 --> 00:47:24,069
Cleaner ways
don't win wars.

694
00:47:53,803 --> 00:47:56,771
Are you afraid,
onion knight?

695
00:47:59,008 --> 00:48:00,257
Someone once told me

696
00:48:00,282 --> 00:48:02,680
the night is dark and
full of terrors.

697
00:48:04,379 --> 00:48:07,081
You've carried more
unpleasant cargo in your time.

698
00:48:10,985 --> 00:48:13,921
Are you a good man,
Ser Davos Seaworth?

699
00:48:13,955 --> 00:48:15,915
I'd say my parts
are mixed, My Lady--

700
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:17,825
good and bad.

701
00:48:17,826 --> 00:48:20,328
If half an onion
is black with rot,

702
00:48:20,362 --> 00:48:22,263
it's a rotten onion.

703
00:48:22,298 --> 00:48:25,000
A man is good
or he is evil.

704
00:48:25,034 --> 00:48:26,901
- And which are you?
- <i>Oh, good.</i>

705
00:48:26,936 --> 00:48:30,238
I'm a knight myself
of sorts,

706
00:48:30,273 --> 00:48:33,108
a champion of light
and life.

707
00:48:33,142 --> 00:48:36,311
Well, that must be
very nice for you.

708
00:48:52,565 --> 00:48:56,701
- Do you love your wife?
- I do.

709
00:48:56,736 --> 00:48:59,037
Yet you have known
other women.

710
00:48:59,071 --> 00:49:00,905
Don't talk about my wife.

711
00:49:00,939 --> 00:49:04,909
I'm not. I'm talking about
other women.

712
00:49:04,943 --> 00:49:07,311
Like me, Ser Davos.

713
00:49:11,583 --> 00:49:13,484
You want me.

714
00:49:13,519 --> 00:49:16,487
You want to see
what's beneath this robe.

715
00:49:18,090 --> 00:49:20,291
And you will.

716
00:49:24,831 --> 00:49:27,867
Strange that
this Lord of Light

717
00:49:27,901 --> 00:49:30,770
asks you to work
in the shadows.

718
00:49:30,804 --> 00:49:34,073
Shadows cannot live
in the dark, Ser Davos.

719
00:49:34,108 --> 00:49:36,609
They are servants
of light,

720
00:49:36,643 --> 00:49:39,078
the children of fire.

721
00:49:39,112 --> 00:49:42,548
And the brighter the flame,
the darker they are.

722
00:49:42,582 --> 00:49:45,417
These weren't here before.
They've barred the passage.

723
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:49,187
They can't bar
our passage.

724
00:49:54,594 --> 00:49:56,128
Gods protect us.

725
00:49:56,162 --> 00:49:59,665
There's only one God,
Ser Davos,

726
00:49:59,699 --> 00:50:02,401
and he only protects
those who serve him.
