5
00:01:52,457 --> 00:01:55,525
I made a deal for you
to keep your ungrateful head

6
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,494
on your ungrateful neck
a little while longer.

7
00:01:57,528 --> 00:01:59,363
<i>I'm sorry,</i>
<i>what am I grateful for?</i>

8
00:01:59,397 --> 00:02:01,164
The opportunity to live
and die at the Wall

9
00:02:01,199 --> 00:02:03,166
as punishment for a crime
I did not commit?

10
00:02:03,201 --> 00:02:05,402
You threw your life away.
You threw it away.

11
00:02:05,436 --> 00:02:08,138
It's not a joke.
You understand that, don't you?

12
00:02:08,172 --> 00:02:10,874
Of course it's a joke,
just not a very funny one.

13
00:02:13,644 --> 00:02:15,579
I couldn't--

14
00:02:15,613 --> 00:02:17,514
I couldn't listen to her

15
00:02:17,548 --> 00:02:19,950
standing there
telling her lies.

16
00:02:19,984 --> 00:02:21,351
I couldn't do it.

17
00:02:21,386 --> 00:02:23,954
You fell in love
with a whore.

18
00:02:23,988 --> 00:02:26,056
Yes, I fell in love
with a whore.

19
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:29,826
And I was stupid enough to think
that she had fallen in love with me.

20
00:02:34,132 --> 00:02:36,233
That deal you made,

21
00:02:36,267 --> 00:02:39,036
it was everything
Father wanted.

22
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:40,370
<i>You do see that?</i>

23
00:02:40,405 --> 00:02:42,272
<i>He gets you back</i>
<i>as his heir.</i>

24
00:02:42,306 --> 00:02:44,508
<i>The future</i>
<i>Lord of the Rock.</i>

25
00:02:44,542 --> 00:02:47,210
And he ships me off
to Castle Black,

26
00:02:47,245 --> 00:02:49,046
out of sight at last.

27
00:02:50,481 --> 00:02:52,516
All so perfect.

28
00:02:54,552 --> 00:02:56,987
It felt good
to take that from him.

29
00:02:58,689 --> 00:03:02,426
He knows I'm innocent and he's
willing to sacrifice me anyway.

30
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:04,394
He's willing
to sacrifice any of us.

31
00:03:04,429 --> 00:03:06,163
Not you.

32
00:03:06,197 --> 00:03:08,331
You're the golden son.

33
00:03:08,366 --> 00:03:10,700
You could kill a king,
lose a hand,

34
00:03:10,768 --> 00:03:12,969
fuck your own sister,
you'll always be the golden son.

35
00:03:13,004 --> 00:03:14,438
Careful.

36
00:03:14,472 --> 00:03:16,840
I'm the last friend
you've got.

37
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:23,880
At least I got to tell
them what they really are.

38
00:03:23,915 --> 00:03:26,049
Yes, brilliant speech.

39
00:03:26,084 --> 00:03:28,418
They'll be talking
about it for days to come.

40
00:03:28,453 --> 00:03:30,854
<i>I thought you were</i>
<i>a realist.</i>

41
00:03:30,888 --> 00:03:33,523
Didn't realize
you'd die for pride.

42
00:03:33,558 --> 00:03:36,293
Don't give up on me
just yet.

43
00:03:36,327 --> 00:03:38,862
I survived one
trial by combat,

44
00:03:38,896 --> 00:03:40,964
even though you weren't
there to save me.

45
00:03:40,998 --> 00:03:43,467
I can't save you
this time either.

46
00:03:44,802 --> 00:03:47,170
<i>My training has proved</i>

47
00:03:47,205 --> 00:03:50,040
that I can't beat
a stable boy with my left hand.

48
00:03:50,074 --> 00:03:53,176
Where's your sense
of adventure?

49
00:03:54,412 --> 00:03:56,446
Even if you lose,
imagine the look

50
00:03:56,481 --> 00:03:57,714
on Father's face
when you fall.

51
00:03:57,748 --> 00:04:00,083
Our family name snuffed out

52
00:04:00,118 --> 00:04:02,853
with a single swing
of the sword.

53
00:04:02,887 --> 00:04:04,488
It is tempting.

54
00:04:20,638 --> 00:04:22,205
Well...

55
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,142
Bronn fought for me once,
he'll do it again.

56
00:04:26,511 --> 00:04:28,645
If he wins,

57
00:04:28,679 --> 00:04:30,680
I expect I'll be
in his debt

58
00:04:30,715 --> 00:04:32,549
for the rest
of my life.

59
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:34,251
If he wins.

60
00:04:34,285 --> 00:04:35,685
Will you find him for me?

61
00:04:38,556 --> 00:04:41,658
Who does Cersei plan
on naming as a champion?

62
00:04:41,692 --> 00:04:44,427
I hope it's Ser Meryn Trant.

63
00:04:44,462 --> 00:04:47,931
I'd enjoy watching Bronn
disembowel that pompous child beater.

64
00:04:47,965 --> 00:04:49,833
No.

65
00:04:49,867 --> 00:04:52,402
Not Ser Meryn.

66
00:05:02,313 --> 00:05:04,147
<i>Go on, move it.</i>

67
00:05:04,182 --> 00:05:06,550
And you.

68
00:05:06,584 --> 00:05:08,418
Come on.

69
00:05:18,062 --> 00:05:20,597
Mercy.

70
00:05:20,631 --> 00:05:22,232
Please.

71
00:05:22,266 --> 00:05:24,201
Please, mercy.

72
00:05:34,078 --> 00:05:37,614
Ser Gregor.
Welcome to the capital.

73
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:41,484
Thank you for riding
here so quickly.

74
00:05:44,689 --> 00:05:47,457
You seem to be
in good form.

75
00:05:47,491 --> 00:05:49,459
Who am I fighting?

76
00:05:49,493 --> 00:05:51,661
Does it matter?

77
00:06:15,453 --> 00:06:16,953
Could be food.

78
00:06:16,988 --> 00:06:19,022
Could be soldiers.

79
00:06:43,748 --> 00:06:46,082
You shouldn't be sitting
out here like this.

80
00:06:46,117 --> 00:06:48,518
Where else to sit?

81
00:06:48,552 --> 00:06:51,354
Tried to walk back
to my hut,

82
00:06:51,389 --> 00:06:53,857
hurt too much.

83
00:06:54,992 --> 00:06:57,294
Then I remembered
they burned my hut down.

84
00:06:57,328 --> 00:06:59,396
Who were "they"?

85
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:01,965
I stopped asking
a while ago.

86
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:08,705
That's not gonna
get better.

87
00:07:08,739 --> 00:07:10,006
Doesn't seem so.

88
00:07:10,107 --> 00:07:12,075
A bad way to go.

89
00:07:13,778 --> 00:07:15,645
Haven't you had enough?

90
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,414
Of what?

91
00:07:20,451 --> 00:07:22,485
I know.

92
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,721
Time to go.

93
00:07:24,755 --> 00:07:27,590
Take matters into
my own hands.

94
00:07:29,827 --> 00:07:32,395
The thought
has occurred to me.

95
00:07:35,933 --> 00:07:37,901
So why go on?

96
00:07:38,903 --> 00:07:40,770
Habit.

97
00:07:43,207 --> 00:07:45,408
Nothing could
be worse than this.

98
00:07:45,443 --> 00:07:48,978
Maybe nothing is
worse than this.

99
00:07:50,281 --> 00:07:54,751
Nothing isn't better
or worse than anything.

100
00:07:57,188 --> 00:07:59,622
Nothing is just nothing.

101
00:08:03,761 --> 00:08:06,029
Who are you?

102
00:08:07,998 --> 00:08:10,266
My name is Arya.

103
00:08:10,301 --> 00:08:12,569
Arya Stark.

104
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,841
You her father?

105
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:19,676
Her captor.

106
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:22,812
Bringing her to her aunt
for ransom.

107
00:08:22,847 --> 00:08:26,716
A fair exchange,
that is.

108
00:08:29,453 --> 00:08:32,288
Always held to the notion
of fair exchange

109
00:08:32,323 --> 00:08:34,924
in all my dealings.

110
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:38,361
You give me,
I give you.

111
00:08:39,563 --> 00:08:41,331
<i>Fair.</i>

112
00:08:41,365 --> 00:08:43,833
A balance.

113
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:48,071
No balance anymore.

114
00:08:53,644 --> 00:08:55,812
Could I have
a drink?

115
00:08:55,846 --> 00:08:58,148
Dying is thirsty work.

116
00:09:08,192 --> 00:09:09,893
Wish it were wine.

117
00:09:11,195 --> 00:09:12,996
So do I.

118
00:09:32,149 --> 00:09:34,050
That's where the heart is.

119
00:09:37,988 --> 00:09:39,656
That's how you kill a man.

120
00:09:47,131 --> 00:09:48,932
The fuck you doing?

121
00:09:50,768 --> 00:09:52,802
<i>There's a price</i>
<i>on your head.</i>

122
00:09:52,837 --> 00:09:55,605
Guess that's what the king does
when you tell him to fuck off.

123
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:57,006
The king's dead.

124
00:09:57,041 --> 00:10:00,176
<i>He drank poisoned wine</i>
<i>at his own wedding.</i>

125
00:10:00,211 --> 00:10:03,213
The bounty on you is for
killing Lannister soldiers.

126
00:10:03,247 --> 00:10:04,647
100 silver stags.

127
00:10:04,682 --> 00:10:06,549
And you thought you
were going to collect it?

128
00:10:06,584 --> 00:10:09,686
<i>Didn't think very hard,</i>
<i>did you?</i>

129
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,323
You were Yoren's prisoners when
he was taking me to the Wall.

130
00:10:13,357 --> 00:10:16,626
He told me he'd fuck
me bloody with a stick.

131
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:20,563
This day's really not working out
the way you planned.

132
00:10:20,598 --> 00:10:22,732
He on your little list?

133
00:10:22,766 --> 00:10:25,134
He can't be.

134
00:10:25,169 --> 00:10:27,570
I don't know his name.

135
00:10:28,806 --> 00:10:30,373
What's your name?

136
00:10:31,876 --> 00:10:33,910
- Rorge.
- Thank you.

137
00:10:40,718 --> 00:10:42,752
You're learning.

138
00:10:47,658 --> 00:10:50,627
<i>Rangers returning!</i>

139
00:10:52,963 --> 00:10:54,964
<i>They return!</i>

140
00:10:54,999 --> 00:10:57,867
- <i>Rangers returning!</i>
- Greetings.

141
00:10:57,902 --> 00:11:00,069
<i>Didn't think I'd see</i>
<i>you again.</i>

142
00:11:00,104 --> 00:11:01,704
All right, Jon?

143
00:11:01,739 --> 00:11:03,373
Welcome back, brother.

144
00:11:12,316 --> 00:11:14,417
Lord Snow.

145
00:11:19,623 --> 00:11:21,958
<i>This is no place</i>
<i>for wild beasts.</i>

146
00:11:21,992 --> 00:11:23,927
Lock him away

147
00:11:23,961 --> 00:11:26,095
or I'll let Hobb throw him
in tonight's stew.

148
00:11:37,141 --> 00:11:39,008
Come on, Ghost.

149
00:11:41,078 --> 00:11:45,281
Mance's army was closing in
on Craster's Keep when we left.

150
00:11:45,316 --> 00:11:48,117
We saw their campfires
from Osric's Hill.

151
00:11:48,185 --> 00:11:49,953
They'll reach the Wall
before the next full moon.

152
00:11:49,987 --> 00:11:52,322
I'm surprised you didn't
ride over and say hello.

153
00:11:52,356 --> 00:11:54,557
The King-beyond-the-Wall
is your old friend, isn't he?

154
00:11:54,592 --> 00:11:56,125
We need to prepare.

155
00:11:56,193 --> 00:11:57,527
We've been preparing.

156
00:11:57,561 --> 00:11:58,928
We should seal the tunnel.

157
00:12:00,698 --> 00:12:02,231
Plug it with rocks
and ice.

158
00:12:02,266 --> 00:12:03,700
Flood it
and let it freeze.

159
00:12:03,734 --> 00:12:05,168
<i>And how would we</i>
<i>range north?</i>

160
00:12:05,202 --> 00:12:07,236
- We wouldn't.
<i>- Coward.</i>

161
00:12:07,271 --> 00:12:09,072
You would cut off
our legs,

162
00:12:09,106 --> 00:12:10,707
pluck out our eyes,

163
00:12:10,741 --> 00:12:12,642
leave us cowering
behind the Wall

164
00:12:12,676 --> 00:12:14,544
hoping for the storm
to pass?

165
00:12:14,578 --> 00:12:17,146
We can't defend the gate
against 100,000 men.

166
00:12:17,181 --> 00:12:19,649
This castle has stood
for thousands of years.

167
00:12:19,683 --> 00:12:23,019
The Night's Watch has defended
her for thousands of years.

168
00:12:23,053 --> 00:12:26,155
And in all those centuries, we have
never sealed the tunnel.

169
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:28,458
Have you ever seen
a giant, Ser Alliser?

170
00:12:28,492 --> 00:12:30,660
<i>I have.</i>

171
00:12:30,694 --> 00:12:32,629
The tunnel's gate
won't stop them.

172
00:12:32,663 --> 00:12:34,731
The bars on those gates
are four inches thick.

173
00:12:34,765 --> 00:12:36,466
Cold-rolled steel.

174
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,701
They won't stop them.

175
00:12:40,204 --> 00:12:43,039
Remind me which order
you belong to, Lord Snow.

176
00:12:43,073 --> 00:12:45,041
The stewards.

177
00:12:45,075 --> 00:12:48,011
Are the stewards responsible
for maintaining the tunnel?

178
00:12:48,045 --> 00:12:50,446
No.

179
00:12:50,514 --> 00:12:52,148
Who would that be?

180
00:12:53,817 --> 00:12:55,918
- The builders.
- Ah, the builders.

181
00:12:55,953 --> 00:12:58,154
First Builder Yarwyck,

182
00:12:58,188 --> 00:13:01,157
Lord Snow here recommends
sealing the tunnel,

183
00:13:01,191 --> 00:13:03,860
leaving us unable
to carry out our duties

184
00:13:03,894 --> 00:13:06,696
as sworn brothers
of the Night's Watch.

185
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:08,865
Do you agree with him?

186
00:13:17,508 --> 00:13:19,108
No.

187
00:13:20,811 --> 00:13:23,780
<i>Given your deep knowledge of</i>
<i>the wildling army, Lord Snow,</i>

188
00:13:23,814 --> 00:13:27,183
you and Tarly will take
night duties atop the Wall

189
00:13:27,217 --> 00:13:29,085
until the full moon.

190
00:13:31,088 --> 00:13:32,889
<i>Moving on.</i>

191
00:13:32,923 --> 00:13:36,793
<i>First Builder, we'll need 100 barrels</i>
<i>of pitch brought atop the wall.</i>

192
00:13:36,827 --> 00:13:38,394
<i>Aye.</i>

193
00:14:02,186 --> 00:14:04,220
My lord.

194
00:14:05,956 --> 00:14:08,191
You have new clothes.

195
00:14:08,225 --> 00:14:10,526
Do you like 'em?
Eh?

196
00:14:12,029 --> 00:14:13,930
Gloves are doeskin.

197
00:14:13,964 --> 00:14:15,398
Softer than
a virgin's thighs.

198
00:14:15,432 --> 00:14:16,833
<i>I sent for you</i>
<i>days ago.</i>

199
00:14:16,867 --> 00:14:19,702
- I've been a bit busy.
- Doing what?

200
00:14:22,206 --> 00:14:25,341
My lonesome
bachelor days are over.

201
00:14:27,077 --> 00:14:29,212
I'm to wed
Lollys Stokeworth.

202
00:14:30,514 --> 00:14:32,448
Lollys Stokeworth?

203
00:14:32,483 --> 00:14:36,052
<i>She doesn't strike me</i>
<i>as your sort of girl.</i>

204
00:14:36,086 --> 00:14:39,088
I wouldn't say I had
a single sort of girl.

205
00:14:39,123 --> 00:14:40,690
She's dim-witted.

206
00:14:40,724 --> 00:14:42,125
If I wanted wits,
I'd marry you.

207
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:45,094
When my sister arranged
this love match,

208
00:14:45,129 --> 00:14:48,264
did she mention that Lollys
has an older sister?

209
00:14:48,298 --> 00:14:49,699
Falyse.

210
00:14:49,733 --> 00:14:52,101
Aye, I did know
about the older sister.

211
00:14:52,136 --> 00:14:54,170
And you understand
the rules of inheritance?

212
00:14:54,204 --> 00:14:55,505
Falyse is 40
and barren.

213
00:14:55,539 --> 00:14:58,741
<i>She still gets Castle Stokeworth</i>
<i>when her father dies.</i>

214
00:14:58,776 --> 00:15:00,209
She does.

215
00:15:00,244 --> 00:15:02,478
Unless she happens
to perish before her father.

216
00:15:02,513 --> 00:15:04,380
Then Lollys gets the castle.

217
00:15:06,483 --> 00:15:08,451
What? Ladies fall
from their horses

218
00:15:08,485 --> 00:15:10,586
and snap their pretty
necks all the time.

219
00:15:10,621 --> 00:15:13,055
You and my sister
deserve each other.

220
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:15,892
<i>Why did you bother</i>
<i>to come here?</i>

221
00:15:21,665 --> 00:15:25,635
You once said if anyone ever asked
me to sell you out,

222
00:15:25,669 --> 00:15:27,236
you'd double their price.

223
00:15:27,271 --> 00:15:29,605
Is it two wives you want
or two castles?

224
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,340
One of each will do.

225
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:34,911
But if you want me
to kill the Mountain for you,

226
00:15:34,945 --> 00:15:36,712
it'd better be
a damn big castle.

227
00:15:36,747 --> 00:15:39,115
I'm bit short
on castles at the moment.

228
00:15:39,149 --> 00:15:40,950
But I can offer you
gold and gratitude.

229
00:15:40,984 --> 00:15:42,652
I have gold.

230
00:15:42,686 --> 00:15:44,120
What can I buy
with gratitude?

231
00:15:44,154 --> 00:15:45,688
You might be surprised.

232
00:15:45,722 --> 00:15:48,558
A Lannister always
pays his debts.

233
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:50,393
Your sister's
a Lannister, too.

234
00:15:50,427 --> 00:15:52,161
My wife is heir
to Winterfell.

235
00:15:52,196 --> 00:15:56,032
<i>If I emerge from this</i>
<i>with my head still on my shoulders,</i>

236
00:15:56,066 --> 00:15:59,836
<i>I may one day rule</i>
<i>the North in her name.</i>

237
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:02,972
I could carve you out
a big piece of it.

238
00:16:03,006 --> 00:16:04,974
If and may and could.

239
00:16:05,008 --> 00:16:07,510
It's bloody
cold up north.

240
00:16:07,544 --> 00:16:09,979
Lollys is soft and warm.

241
00:16:10,013 --> 00:16:11,781
And close.

242
00:16:11,815 --> 00:16:14,483
If I gave you the choice
between fucking Lollys

243
00:16:14,518 --> 00:16:16,485
and fighting the Mountain,
you'd have your britches down

244
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,854
and your cock out
before I could blink.

245
00:16:17,888 --> 00:16:19,689
Does he frighten
you so much?

246
00:16:19,723 --> 00:16:21,924
I'd be a bloody fool
if he didn't frighten me.

247
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:23,826
He's freakish big
and freakish strong.

248
00:16:23,861 --> 00:16:26,662
And quicker than
you'd expect for a man of that size.

249
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:30,299
Maybe I could take him,

250
00:16:30,334 --> 00:16:32,568
dance around
until he's so tired

251
00:16:32,603 --> 00:16:34,337
of hacking at me,
he dropped his sword,

252
00:16:34,371 --> 00:16:36,405
get him off
his feet somehow.

253
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,374
But one misstep...

254
00:16:38,408 --> 00:16:40,109
...and I'm dead.

255
00:16:40,143 --> 00:16:42,378
Why should I risk it?

256
00:16:42,412 --> 00:16:44,914
Because you're my friend.

257
00:16:44,948 --> 00:16:47,083
Aye, I'm your friend.

258
00:16:47,117 --> 00:16:50,519
And when have you ever
risked your life for me?

259
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:01,697
I like you,

260
00:17:01,732 --> 00:17:04,166
pampered little shit
that you are.

261
00:17:04,201 --> 00:17:06,535
I just like myself more.

262
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:08,170
I understand.

263
00:17:08,205 --> 00:17:09,872
I'm sorry it has
to be this way.

264
00:17:09,907 --> 00:17:11,540
Why are you sorry?

265
00:17:11,575 --> 00:17:13,609
Because you're
an evil bastard

266
00:17:13,644 --> 00:17:15,578
with no conscience
and no heart?

267
00:17:15,612 --> 00:17:18,314
<i>That's what I liked about</i>
<i>you in the first place.</i>

268
00:17:24,721 --> 00:17:26,789
We had some
good days together.

269
00:17:26,823 --> 00:17:28,658
Yes, we did.

270
00:17:43,273 --> 00:17:44,874
What will you do?

271
00:17:44,908 --> 00:17:48,377
I suppose I'll have to kill
the Mountain myself.

272
00:17:50,113 --> 00:17:52,315
Won't that make
for a great song?

273
00:17:55,352 --> 00:17:58,154
I hope to hear
them sing it one day.

274
00:18:16,306 --> 00:18:17,940
How did you get in here?

275
00:18:17,975 --> 00:18:19,608
Your door is well guarded,

276
00:18:19,643 --> 00:18:21,777
but your window is not.

277
00:18:28,085 --> 00:18:31,120
I swam to an island
a mile offshore for these.

278
00:18:31,154 --> 00:18:33,656
Don't do that again.

279
00:18:35,025 --> 00:18:37,626
Never met a woman who
didn't like wildflowers.

280
00:18:37,661 --> 00:18:40,096
These are my
private quarters.

281
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:42,665
If I want you here,
I will summon you.

282
00:18:44,167 --> 00:18:47,103
Forgive me, my queen.
I live to serve you.

283
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:55,411
<i>Tell me why you're here.</i>

284
00:18:59,383 --> 00:19:01,283
I came to ask a favor.

285
00:19:01,351 --> 00:19:03,652
I only have two talents
in this world--

286
00:19:03,687 --> 00:19:06,022
war and women.

287
00:19:06,056 --> 00:19:08,724
<i>You are staying here</i>
<i>in Meereen to rule.</i>

288
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:10,960
<i>That is a wise decision.</i>
<i>I respect it.</i>

289
00:19:10,994 --> 00:19:12,874
But here in Meereen,
I cannot pursue my talents.

290
00:19:12,896 --> 00:19:15,531
I've ordered the Second Sons
to patrol the streets

291
00:19:15,565 --> 00:19:17,299
to stop
the revenge killing.

292
00:19:17,334 --> 00:19:18,601
You've ordered us
to be night watchmen.

293
00:19:18,635 --> 00:19:20,569
And as for women,

294
00:19:20,604 --> 00:19:24,340
there are thousands
in Meereen you can pursue.

295
00:19:25,342 --> 00:19:27,143
There is only one,

296
00:19:27,177 --> 00:19:29,812
and she does not
want me.

297
00:19:31,348 --> 00:19:32,648
You swore me your sword.

298
00:19:32,682 --> 00:19:35,251
My sword is yours
till the day I die.

299
00:19:35,285 --> 00:19:37,453
So if I command you
to stay in Meereen

300
00:19:37,487 --> 00:19:38,921
and patrol the streets?

301
00:19:38,955 --> 00:19:41,657
I'll stay in Meereen
and patrol the streets.

302
00:19:41,691 --> 00:19:44,160
Send me to kill
your enemies.

303
00:19:44,194 --> 00:19:46,495
Any enemy anywhere.

304
00:19:47,564 --> 00:19:50,066
Let me do
what I do best.

305
00:19:51,468 --> 00:19:53,269
Very well.

306
00:19:59,276 --> 00:20:01,310
Do what you do best.

307
00:20:12,155 --> 00:20:14,356
Take off your clothes.

308
00:20:43,487 --> 00:20:45,087
Oh.

309
00:20:46,323 --> 00:20:48,357
Come in, my queen.
Please.

310
00:20:48,391 --> 00:20:50,326
I didn't mean
to disturb you, my lady.

311
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,861
You could never
disturb me.

312
00:20:51,895 --> 00:20:54,263
I just wanted to speak
with you before we left.

313
00:20:54,297 --> 00:20:57,133
Could you bring me
that vial over there?

314
00:21:00,003 --> 00:21:01,604
The blue one.

315
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:06,142
<i>No, no, no.</i>
<i>Not that one.</i>

316
00:21:06,176 --> 00:21:08,377
You don't even want
to touch that one.

317
00:21:08,411 --> 00:21:10,579
<i>Next to it.</i>

318
00:21:10,614 --> 00:21:12,615
<i>That's the one.</i>

319
00:21:31,268 --> 00:21:33,302
When I looked into
the flames this morning,

320
00:21:33,336 --> 00:21:35,571
the Lord spoke to me.

321
00:21:35,605 --> 00:21:37,473
He said,

322
00:21:37,507 --> 00:21:41,977
"Tonight, you will have your
last good bath in a long while.

323
00:21:42,012 --> 00:21:44,246
Make it count."

324
00:21:47,517 --> 00:21:48,851
A joke.

325
00:21:50,787 --> 00:21:52,655
Not a very good one,
I'm afraid.

326
00:21:52,689 --> 00:21:54,523
It was. I--

327
00:21:54,558 --> 00:21:57,159
humor isn't my strength.

328
00:21:57,194 --> 00:21:58,827
That's because
st jokes are lies

329
00:21:58,862 --> 00:22:01,564
and you're devoted
to the truth.

330
00:22:01,598 --> 00:22:04,833
If they're lies, my lady,
aren't they best avoided?

331
00:22:04,868 --> 00:22:07,336
Not always.

332
00:22:16,713 --> 00:22:18,914
Most of these powders
and potions

333
00:22:18,949 --> 00:22:20,549
are lies.

334
00:22:20,584 --> 00:22:25,120
<i>Deceptions to make men</i>
<i>think they witnessed our Lord's power.</i>

335
00:22:25,155 --> 00:22:28,624
Once they step into his light,
they will see the lie for what it was--

336
00:22:28,658 --> 00:22:31,961
a trick that led them
to the truth.

337
00:22:31,995 --> 00:22:34,763
<i>A pinch of this powder</i>
<i>in a bonfire</i>

338
00:22:34,798 --> 00:22:38,033
will send a flaming column
screaming towards the sky.

339
00:22:38,068 --> 00:22:40,836
And this one creates
a black smoke

340
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:43,305
that will make the bravest
man piss himself with fear.

341
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:46,775
And a drop of this
in any man's wine

342
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:49,111
will drive him
wild with lust.

343
00:22:52,415 --> 00:22:54,550
Did you use it
with Stannis?

344
00:22:54,584 --> 00:22:55,951
No.

345
00:22:58,655 --> 00:23:00,222
Don't be upset.

346
00:23:00,257 --> 00:23:03,459
Men never crave
what they already have.

347
00:23:05,295 --> 00:23:07,229
It's only flesh.

348
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:09,898
It needs
what it needs.

349
00:23:13,169 --> 00:23:16,105
No act done in service
of the Lord

350
00:23:16,139 --> 00:23:18,941
can ever be called a sin.

351
00:23:18,975 --> 00:23:22,411
I thank God every day
for bringing you to us.

352
00:23:22,445 --> 00:23:25,014
And Stannis to you.

353
00:23:25,048 --> 00:23:29,551
He wants to bring
Shireen with us.

354
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:34,023
I think that would be
ill-advised.

355
00:23:34,057 --> 00:23:37,693
<i>My daughter has heretical tendencies,</i>
<i>as you're well aware.</i>

356
00:23:37,727 --> 00:23:41,530
I don't know if her doubt is real
or simply meant to spite me,

357
00:23:41,564 --> 00:23:44,967
but whichever the case,
she should stay home.

358
00:23:49,239 --> 00:23:51,273
I understand
how you feel.

359
00:23:51,308 --> 00:23:52,675
Hmm.

360
00:23:52,709 --> 00:23:54,910
But that
is impossible.

361
00:23:57,714 --> 00:23:59,748
Why?

362
00:23:59,783 --> 00:24:03,619
You don't need powders
and potions, my queen.

363
00:24:03,653 --> 00:24:05,788
You don't need lies.

364
00:24:05,822 --> 00:24:09,291
You are strong enough to look into
the Lord's light

365
00:24:09,326 --> 00:24:11,660
and see his truth
for yourself.

366
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,601
However harsh it is.

367
00:24:19,636 --> 00:24:22,137
However hard for us
to understand.

368
00:24:23,807 --> 00:24:25,207
<i>You don't need my help,</i>

369
00:24:25,241 --> 00:24:28,043
<i>but I will need yours soon.</i>

370
00:24:28,078 --> 00:24:31,113
When we set sail,
your daughter must be with us.

371
00:24:34,651 --> 00:24:36,819
The Lord needs her.

372
00:24:44,127 --> 00:24:46,528
Jorah the Andal.

373
00:24:47,664 --> 00:24:49,865
Are you here
to see our queen?

374
00:24:51,601 --> 00:24:53,702
She's in a good mood.

375
00:25:08,351 --> 00:25:10,652
Khaleesi.

376
00:25:10,687 --> 00:25:13,088
- You're here early.
- Later than some.

377
00:25:15,392 --> 00:25:16,859
You don't approve?

378
00:25:16,893 --> 00:25:19,294
It's not a question of approval,
it's a question of trust.

379
00:25:19,329 --> 00:25:21,663
You neither
approve nor trust.

380
00:25:21,698 --> 00:25:23,298
Why would I?
The man's a sellsword.

381
00:25:23,333 --> 00:25:24,867
Didn't you fight for
the Golden Company

382
00:25:24,901 --> 00:25:26,435
before pledging
your sword to my brother?

383
00:25:26,469 --> 00:25:28,137
I did.

384
00:25:28,171 --> 00:25:29,605
I trust you.

385
00:25:29,639 --> 00:25:32,107
Daario Naharis
killed his captains

386
00:25:32,142 --> 00:25:35,310
and dumped their heads at your feet
when he grew tired of their commands.

387
00:25:35,345 --> 00:25:37,846
How could you ever have
faith in a man like that?

388
00:25:37,881 --> 00:25:41,250
I could never have faith
in a man like Daario.

389
00:25:42,786 --> 00:25:45,421
That's why I've sent him and
the Second Sons to retake Yunkai.

390
00:25:47,557 --> 00:25:49,658
- You have?
- I have.

391
00:25:49,692 --> 00:25:51,760
Without you there
to rule, Khaleesi,

392
00:25:51,795 --> 00:25:54,062
I fear the masters
will simply bide their time,

393
00:25:54,097 --> 00:25:56,331
wait for the invaders
to leave and reassert control.

394
00:25:56,366 --> 00:26:00,502
That is why I've ordered Daario
to execute every master in Yunkai.

395
00:26:01,938 --> 00:26:04,506
The masters tear babies
from their mothers' arms.

396
00:26:04,541 --> 00:26:07,009
They mutilate little boys
by the thousands.

397
00:26:07,043 --> 00:26:09,445
They train little girls
in the art of pleasuring old men.

398
00:26:09,479 --> 00:26:12,581
They treat men like beasts,
as you said yourself.

399
00:26:12,615 --> 00:26:16,151
Herding the masters into pens
and slaughtering them by the thousands

400
00:26:16,186 --> 00:26:18,187
is also treating men
like beasts.

401
00:26:18,221 --> 00:26:20,389
The slaves you freed,

402
00:26:20,423 --> 00:26:22,524
brutality is all
they've ever known.

403
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,660
If you want them to know
something else,

404
00:26:24,694 --> 00:26:26,061
you'll have
to show it to them.

405
00:26:26,095 --> 00:26:28,163
And repay the slavers
with what? Kindness?

406
00:26:28,198 --> 00:26:29,698
A fine?
A stern warning?

407
00:26:29,732 --> 00:26:32,868
It's tempting to see
your enemies as evil, all of them,

408
00:26:32,902 --> 00:26:35,637
but there's good and evil
on both sides in every war ever fought.

409
00:26:35,672 --> 00:26:38,140
Let the priests argue
over good and evil.

410
00:26:38,174 --> 00:26:39,708
Slavery is real.

411
00:26:39,742 --> 00:26:41,977
I can end it.
I will end it.

412
00:26:42,011 --> 00:26:44,313
<i>And I will end</i>
<i>those behind it.</i>

413
00:26:44,347 --> 00:26:46,548
I sold men
into slavery, Khaleesi.

414
00:26:46,583 --> 00:26:51,420
And now you are helping me
show them to freedom.

415
00:26:51,454 --> 00:26:54,823
I wouldn't be here to help you
if Ned Stark had done to me

416
00:26:54,858 --> 00:26:57,693
what you want to do
to the masters of Yunkai.

417
00:27:02,232 --> 00:27:05,133
The man who came to me
the other day about burying his father.

418
00:27:05,168 --> 00:27:07,236
Hizdahr zo Loraq?

419
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:09,972
He will accompany
the Second Sons

420
00:27:10,006 --> 00:27:11,940
and serve as my ambassador
to Yunkai.

421
00:27:11,975 --> 00:27:14,943
He will tell the masters
what has happened in Meereen.

422
00:27:14,978 --> 00:27:18,547
He will explain the choice
they have before them.

423
00:27:18,581 --> 00:27:20,516
They can live
in my new world

424
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:23,585
or they can die
in their old one.

425
00:27:27,724 --> 00:27:30,192
Well, go and catch Daario
before he leaves.

426
00:27:30,226 --> 00:27:32,094
Tell him
I changed my mind.

427
00:27:32,128 --> 00:27:34,496
Yes, Khaleesi.

428
00:27:39,736 --> 00:27:41,470
No.

429
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:47,042
Tell him <i>you</i>
changed my mind.

430
00:27:57,787 --> 00:28:00,689
Rat cunts.

431
00:28:02,125 --> 00:28:04,426
Fucking whore.

432
00:28:06,296 --> 00:28:07,963
<i>You're doing it wrong.</i>

433
00:28:07,997 --> 00:28:10,933
You need to burn away
that horrible bit there.

434
00:28:10,967 --> 00:28:13,702
<i>Otherwise it's gonna</i>
<i>get infected and fester.</i>

435
00:28:16,172 --> 00:28:19,141
I know you don't like fire,
but if you don't do it right--

436
00:28:19,175 --> 00:28:21,109
No fire.

437
00:28:22,211 --> 00:28:24,413
It'll only take a second.

438
00:28:24,447 --> 00:28:26,848
- It won't hurt that much.
- No fire!

439
00:28:41,531 --> 00:28:43,532
Shut up about it.

440
00:28:46,235 --> 00:28:48,270
Shut up about everything.

441
00:28:48,304 --> 00:28:50,973
Thanks to you,
I'm a walking bag of silver

442
00:28:51,007 --> 00:28:53,275
anywhere the Lannisters
hold sway.

443
00:28:54,978 --> 00:28:56,812
Which is everywhere
between where we are now

444
00:28:56,846 --> 00:28:58,847
and where we're going.

445
00:29:01,384 --> 00:29:04,519
I'm as stupid as that hog
you stuck back in the village,

446
00:29:04,554 --> 00:29:08,724
getting myself cut
and stabbed and bitten.

447
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:13,629
No reward is worth
this much trouble.

448
00:29:13,663 --> 00:29:16,598
<i>Wish I'd never</i>
<i>laid eyes on you.</i>

449
00:29:26,843 --> 00:29:29,845
You say your brother
gave you that sword.

450
00:29:32,215 --> 00:29:34,282
My brother gave me this.

451
00:29:36,285 --> 00:29:38,520
It was just like you said
a while back.

452
00:29:38,554 --> 00:29:40,355
<i>Pressed me to the fire</i>

453
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:43,291
like I was a nice
juicy mutton chop.

454
00:29:46,362 --> 00:29:48,063
Why?

455
00:29:48,097 --> 00:29:49,965
Thought I stole
one of his toys.

456
00:29:49,999 --> 00:29:52,567
I didn't steal it.
I was just playing with it.

457
00:29:57,473 --> 00:29:59,441
The pain was bad.

458
00:29:59,475 --> 00:30:01,510
The smell was worse.

459
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:08,850
But the worst thing
was that it was my brother who did it.

460
00:30:12,989 --> 00:30:15,924
My father,
who protected him...

461
00:30:17,894 --> 00:30:20,595
told everyone my bedding
caught fire.

462
00:30:33,276 --> 00:30:35,711
You think
you're on your own?

463
00:30:38,614 --> 00:30:40,315
Let me wash it out

464
00:30:40,349 --> 00:30:42,584
and help you
sew it up at least.

465
00:31:09,212 --> 00:31:11,480
Bit of comfort
never hurt anyone.

466
00:31:11,514 --> 00:31:13,715
We've been sleeping in
ditches the last few weeks.

467
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:16,585
I think we can treat
ourselves to a featherbed for the night

468
00:31:16,619 --> 00:31:19,488
and a hot meal
not cooked by you.

469
00:31:19,555 --> 00:31:20,989
Couldn't agree
more, my lady.

470
00:31:21,023 --> 00:31:22,924
Just don't start expecting
silk underclothes.

471
00:31:22,959 --> 00:31:25,193
Not working for your
former lord any longer.

472
00:31:25,228 --> 00:31:27,529
- Yes, my lady.
- Don't get drunk.

473
00:31:29,232 --> 00:31:30,332
No, my lady.

474
00:31:30,366 --> 00:31:31,833
<i>Can I get you</i>
<i>anything else?</i>

475
00:31:31,868 --> 00:31:33,635
No, this will do
nicely, thank you.

476
00:31:33,669 --> 00:31:35,203
Kidney pie is wonderful.

477
00:31:35,238 --> 00:31:37,172
Thanks.

478
00:31:37,206 --> 00:31:39,407
I do my best.

479
00:31:41,043 --> 00:31:43,612
A good kidney pie is all
about the ingredients.

480
00:31:43,646 --> 00:31:46,615
<i>Flour, lard, water,</i>
<i>eggs, milk.</i>

481
00:31:46,649 --> 00:31:48,450
Easy enough.
But the meat,

482
00:31:48,484 --> 00:31:51,453
peacetime or not, getting your hands on
a good bottom round steak

483
00:31:51,487 --> 00:31:53,155
and calves' kidneys
is not easy.

484
00:31:53,189 --> 00:31:55,757
I mean, some people settle
for plain old beef kidneys.

485
00:31:55,792 --> 00:31:58,059
Got no right to cook
anything, them.

486
00:31:58,094 --> 00:31:59,661
Oh, and the gravy.

487
00:31:59,695 --> 00:32:01,530
Don't get me started
on the gravy.

488
00:32:01,564 --> 00:32:02,931
<i>Very difficult</i>
<i>to get right.</i>

489
00:32:02,965 --> 00:32:04,766
<i>See, a lot of people</i>
<i>give up on the gravy.</i>

490
00:32:04,801 --> 00:32:07,002
You cannot give up
on the gravy.

491
00:32:07,036 --> 00:32:08,603
No gravy, no pie.

492
00:32:08,638 --> 00:32:11,039
Simple as that.

493
00:32:11,073 --> 00:32:14,409
That's nice armor.
Are you a knight?

494
00:32:16,512 --> 00:32:17,979
No.

495
00:32:18,014 --> 00:32:21,149
Oh, it's just people with
armor are usually knights.

496
00:32:21,184 --> 00:32:23,852
<i>Generally speaking.</i>
<i>From King's Landing, though, aren't you?</i>

497
00:32:23,886 --> 00:32:26,721
<i>From there myself originally.</i>
<i>Flea Bottom born and bred.</i>

498
00:32:26,756 --> 00:32:28,557
<i>What brings you</i>
<i>to these parts?</i>

499
00:32:28,591 --> 00:32:30,592
We're looking
for someone.

500
00:32:30,626 --> 00:32:33,061
Someone in particular?
Maybe they came in here.

501
00:32:33,095 --> 00:32:35,455
A lot of people come in here.
Just the other day we had 17--

502
00:32:35,464 --> 00:32:37,399
A girl, tall, red hair,
very pretty.

503
00:32:37,433 --> 00:32:40,936
Her name is Sansa Stark,
but she may be using a different name.

504
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:42,904
Starks?

505
00:32:46,042 --> 00:32:48,910
What, like them lot
from "Winterhell"?

506
00:32:52,348 --> 00:32:54,482
No, ain't seen
anyone like that.

507
00:32:54,517 --> 00:32:56,251
I heard they was
all traitors.

508
00:32:56,285 --> 00:32:58,587
Don't need
no traitors in here.

509
00:32:58,621 --> 00:33:01,957
<i>I pledged my life to</i>
<i>their mother Catelyn Stark.</i>

510
00:33:01,991 --> 00:33:04,192
I swore to her I'd bring
her daughters home.

511
00:33:08,631 --> 00:33:11,166
Sure I can't get you
a bit more kidney pie?

512
00:33:25,314 --> 00:33:26,448
What?

513
00:33:26,482 --> 00:33:28,083
It's nothing, my lady.

514
00:33:28,117 --> 00:33:31,453
You wouldn't be screwing
your face up like that if it was nothing.

515
00:33:31,487 --> 00:33:33,955
Don't want to offend, my lady.
Truly, I don't.

516
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:35,791
You're not interesting
enough to be offensive.

517
00:33:37,593 --> 00:33:39,895
The Lannisters
want Lady Sansa.

518
00:33:39,929 --> 00:33:42,597
The Lannisters
have money.

519
00:33:42,632 --> 00:33:44,432
People kill for money.

520
00:33:45,668 --> 00:33:47,535
I don't think we should
be telling people

521
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:49,137
we're searching
for Lady Sansa.

522
00:33:58,915 --> 00:34:01,850
My lady. My lord.
Could I have a word?

523
00:34:01,884 --> 00:34:03,818
What about?
Not kidney pie.

524
00:34:03,853 --> 00:34:05,420
<i>You seem</i>
<i>like a proper lady.</i>

525
00:34:05,454 --> 00:34:07,889
<i>Someone who could</i>
<i>be trusted.</i>

526
00:34:09,892 --> 00:34:12,027
I never met no Sansa Stark.

527
00:34:12,061 --> 00:34:14,129
But I know her sister...

528
00:34:14,163 --> 00:34:15,997
Arya.

529
00:34:18,134 --> 00:34:21,770
No one's seen Arya Stark
since her father was beheaded.

530
00:34:21,804 --> 00:34:24,606
She's presumed dead.

531
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,574
She weren't when I last
spoke to her.

532
00:34:26,609 --> 00:34:27,432
When was that?

533
00:34:27,457 --> 00:34:29,010
<i>Heading up north with</i>
<i>the Night's Watch.</i>

534
00:34:29,011 --> 00:34:30,512
She was all dressed up
as a boy.

535
00:34:30,546 --> 00:34:33,381
Like your ladyship,
only without the armor.

536
00:34:33,416 --> 00:34:35,250
<i>Going by the name Arry.</i>

537
00:34:35,284 --> 00:34:37,052
- So what happened to her?
- Well--

538
00:34:37,086 --> 00:34:39,254
The quick version.

539
00:34:39,288 --> 00:34:41,122
The Lannisters
took us prisoner.

540
00:34:41,157 --> 00:34:42,991
We escaped.

541
00:34:43,025 --> 00:34:45,226
The Brotherhood took
us prisoner.

542
00:34:45,261 --> 00:34:46,728
They sold me
to the innkeep.

543
00:34:46,762 --> 00:34:49,331
<i>They were gonna sell Arya</i>
<i>to her mother at Riverrun</i>

544
00:34:49,365 --> 00:34:50,665
<i>along with another prisoner.</i>

545
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:52,600
Big ugly fellow.
Foul mouth

546
00:34:52,635 --> 00:34:54,636
and a face like
a half-burnt ham.

547
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:56,604
- <i>Not friendly.</i>
- The Hound.

548
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:58,406
That's the one.

549
00:34:58,441 --> 00:35:01,743
If you find her,
could you give her this?

550
00:35:01,777 --> 00:35:03,578
She liked the last one
I gave her,

551
00:35:03,612 --> 00:35:05,947
but, well, this one
turned out better.

552
00:35:15,524 --> 00:35:18,259
Um, you were saying?

553
00:35:22,298 --> 00:35:25,000
<i>Her mother's dead,</i>
<i>grandfather's dead,</i>

554
00:35:25,034 --> 00:35:27,402
Walder Frey is
the new lord of Riverrun.

555
00:35:27,436 --> 00:35:29,304
The Brotherhood
isn't going to Riverrun.

556
00:35:29,338 --> 00:35:31,272
They'll take her
to the Eyrie, my lady.

557
00:35:31,307 --> 00:35:33,108
Why the Eyrie?

558
00:35:33,142 --> 00:35:35,610
Her aunt, Lysa Arryn.

559
00:35:35,644 --> 00:35:37,712
Catelyn Stark's sister.

560
00:35:37,747 --> 00:35:40,782
She's Arya's last living
relative with money.

561
00:35:40,816 --> 00:35:43,551
She hates the Lannisters.

562
00:35:45,654 --> 00:35:47,856
Lord Tyrion
made sure I knew

563
00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:50,992
which house married which
and who hated who.

564
00:35:51,027 --> 00:35:52,727
Sansa could
be there, too.

565
00:35:52,762 --> 00:35:55,230
Aye, my lady.

566
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:56,965
Could be.

567
00:36:03,372 --> 00:36:05,273
You sure about this?

568
00:36:08,577 --> 00:36:10,178
No.

569
00:36:41,243 --> 00:36:44,112
I imagined you'd be back
at the brothel at this hour.

570
00:36:44,146 --> 00:36:47,413
I did spend some time
with an absolutely stunning

571
00:36:47,438 --> 00:36:48,917
blonde the other day.

572
00:36:48,918 --> 00:36:51,719
Mm, do tell.

573
00:36:51,754 --> 00:36:55,156
I've got every kind
of filth down here

574
00:36:55,191 --> 00:36:56,724
except the kind I like.

575
00:36:56,759 --> 00:36:58,760
Your sister.

576
00:36:58,794 --> 00:37:00,995
Oh.

577
00:37:06,836 --> 00:37:09,604
Cersei approached me.

578
00:37:10,906 --> 00:37:12,941
<i>We spoke a great deal</i>
<i>about her daughter.</i>

579
00:37:12,975 --> 00:37:16,077
How worried your sister
is about her.

580
00:37:16,112 --> 00:37:19,013
<i>She was trying</i>
<i>very hard to pretend</i>

581
00:37:19,048 --> 00:37:21,049
<i>she had not come</i>
<i>to sway me against you.</i>

582
00:37:21,083 --> 00:37:23,384
<i>I think she may have even</i>
<i>believed it herself.</i>

583
00:37:23,419 --> 00:37:26,454
Making honest feelings
do dishonest work

584
00:37:26,489 --> 00:37:28,923
is one of her many gifts.

585
00:37:28,958 --> 00:37:31,960
It was difficult for her
to hide her true intentions.

586
00:37:33,129 --> 00:37:36,764
It is rare
to meet a Lannister

587
00:37:36,799 --> 00:37:40,802
who shares my enthusiasm
for dead Lannisters.

588
00:37:43,272 --> 00:37:45,373
She desperately wants
to see you killed.

589
00:37:45,407 --> 00:37:47,609
She didn't need
to bother you.

590
00:37:47,643 --> 00:37:51,446
It looks as though
I've taken care of that myself.

591
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:54,048
<i>The joy she will feel</i>

592
00:37:54,083 --> 00:37:56,651
<i>when my head</i>
<i>leaves my neck.</i>

593
00:37:56,719 --> 00:37:59,921
She's wanted this
for a long time.

594
00:37:59,955 --> 00:38:02,757
Yes, I know.

595
00:38:02,791 --> 00:38:05,793
<i>We met, you and I.</i>

596
00:38:05,828 --> 00:38:07,428
Many years ago.

597
00:38:07,463 --> 00:38:10,398
I think I would
have remembered that.

598
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:13,768
Unlikely.
You had just been born.

599
00:38:16,238 --> 00:38:18,706
Our father brought me
and my sister Elia with him

600
00:38:18,741 --> 00:38:20,441
on a visit
to Casterly Rock.

601
00:38:20,476 --> 00:38:22,443
<i>My first time</i>
<i>away from Dorne.</i>

602
00:38:22,478 --> 00:38:24,846
I didn't like anything
about the Rock.

603
00:38:26,382 --> 00:38:28,816
Not the food,
not the weather,

604
00:38:28,851 --> 00:38:30,518
not your accents.

605
00:38:30,553 --> 00:38:32,187
Nothing.

606
00:38:33,589 --> 00:38:36,124
But the biggest
disappointment...

607
00:38:36,158 --> 00:38:38,459
you.

608
00:38:40,296 --> 00:38:43,264
You and my family have more
in common than you might admit.

609
00:38:43,299 --> 00:38:45,500
<i>The whole way from Dorne</i>

610
00:38:45,534 --> 00:38:48,369
all anyone talked about
was the monster

611
00:38:48,404 --> 00:38:51,372
that had been born
to Tywin Lannister.

612
00:38:51,407 --> 00:38:54,275
<i>A head twice</i>
<i>the size of his body,</i>

613
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:56,211
<i>a tail between his legs,</i>

614
00:38:56,245 --> 00:38:58,346
claws, one red eye,

615
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:01,282
the privates of both
a girl and a boy.

616
00:39:01,317 --> 00:39:03,251
That would have made
things so much easier.

617
00:39:03,285 --> 00:39:07,155
<i>When we met your sister, she promised</i>
<i>she would show you to us.</i>

618
00:39:07,189 --> 00:39:08,823
Every day we would ask.

619
00:39:08,857 --> 00:39:11,292
Every day she would
say, "Soon."

620
00:39:11,327 --> 00:39:14,629
Then she and your brother

621
00:39:14,663 --> 00:39:18,032
took us
to your nursery and...

622
00:39:19,468 --> 00:39:22,403
she unveiled the freak.

623
00:39:24,607 --> 00:39:26,441
<i>Your head</i>
<i>was a bit large.</i>

624
00:39:26,475 --> 00:39:28,376
<i>Your arms and legs</i>
<i>were a bit small,</i>

625
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:30,078
but no claw.

626
00:39:30,112 --> 00:39:33,414
No red eye.
No tail between your legs.

627
00:39:33,449 --> 00:39:35,783
Just a tiny pink cock.

628
00:39:35,818 --> 00:39:38,586
<i>We didn't try to hide</i>
<i>our disappointment.</i>

629
00:39:38,654 --> 00:39:41,055
<i>"That's not a monster,"</i>
<i>I told Cersei.</i>

630
00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:44,092
"That's just a baby."

631
00:39:45,594 --> 00:39:48,229
<i>And she said,</i>
<i>"He killed my mother."</i>

632
00:39:48,264 --> 00:39:50,765
<i>And she pinched</i>
<i>your little cock so hard,</i>

633
00:39:50,799 --> 00:39:52,800
<i>I thought she might</i>
<i>pull it off.</i>

634
00:39:52,835 --> 00:39:54,936
<i>Until your brother</i>
<i>made her stop.</i>

635
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:57,038
<i>"It doesn't matter,"</i>
<i>she told us.</i>

636
00:39:57,072 --> 00:40:00,041
<i>"Everyone says</i>
<i>he will die soon.</i>

637
00:40:00,075 --> 00:40:01,709
<i>I hope they are right.</i>

638
00:40:01,744 --> 00:40:04,412
<i>He should not</i>
<i>have lived this long."</i>

639
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:09,617
Well...

640
00:40:12,221 --> 00:40:16,891
sooner or later, Cersei always gets
what she wants.

641
00:40:18,961 --> 00:40:21,929
And what about
what I want?

642
00:40:24,266 --> 00:40:26,501
Justice

643
00:40:26,535 --> 00:40:30,138
for my sister
and her children.

644
00:40:30,172 --> 00:40:32,173
If you want justice,

645
00:40:32,207 --> 00:40:35,109
you've come
to the wrong place.

646
00:40:35,144 --> 00:40:37,378
I disagree.

647
00:40:44,887 --> 00:40:47,922
I've come to
the perfect place.

648
00:40:49,658 --> 00:40:51,993
I want to bring those
who have wronged me to justice.

649
00:40:52,027 --> 00:40:55,129
And all those who have
wronged me are right here.

650
00:40:57,466 --> 00:40:59,667
I will begin with
Ser Gregor Clegane,

651
00:40:59,702 --> 00:41:02,470
<i>who killed</i>
<i>my sister's children</i>

652
00:41:02,504 --> 00:41:05,873
and then raped her
with their blood still on his hands

653
00:41:05,908 --> 00:41:08,643
before killing her, too.

654
00:41:17,152 --> 00:41:19,420
I will be your champion.

655
00:42:13,575 --> 00:42:15,476
Hello, Robin.

656
00:42:18,046 --> 00:42:19,380
What are you doing?

657
00:42:19,415 --> 00:42:21,349
I'm building my home,
Winterfell.

658
00:42:21,383 --> 00:42:23,418
At least I think I am.

659
00:42:23,452 --> 00:42:26,120
I haven't been back there
in a very long time.

660
00:42:26,155 --> 00:42:28,523
Why did you leave?

661
00:42:28,557 --> 00:42:30,925
It's a long story.

662
00:42:32,594 --> 00:42:34,162
I stay here in the Eyrie.

663
00:42:34,196 --> 00:42:36,964
Mother says it's dangerous on the roads
and I have to keep myself safe

664
00:42:36,999 --> 00:42:38,633
because I'm the Lord
of the Vale

665
00:42:38,667 --> 00:42:40,968
and the Lord of the Vale
is a very important person.

666
00:42:41,003 --> 00:42:43,304
Yes, you certainly are.

667
00:42:43,338 --> 00:42:45,573
When will you go back?

668
00:42:45,607 --> 00:42:48,309
Probably never.

669
00:42:48,343 --> 00:42:50,445
My family doesn't
live there anymore

670
00:42:50,479 --> 00:42:52,947
and someone
burned it down.

671
00:42:54,149 --> 00:42:55,817
Oh.

672
00:42:55,851 --> 00:42:58,619
Does Winterfell
have a Moon Door?

673
00:42:58,654 --> 00:43:00,421
No, I'm afraid not.

674
00:43:00,456 --> 00:43:02,590
It's not high up in the mountains.
It's down on the ground.

675
00:43:02,624 --> 00:43:04,459
That sounds dangerous.

676
00:43:04,493 --> 00:43:07,295
- How do you make people fly?
- We don't.

677
00:43:07,329 --> 00:43:08,729
What do you do with
all the bad people

678
00:43:08,764 --> 00:43:11,232
and the scary people
and the people you don't like?

679
00:43:11,266 --> 00:43:12,800
I never did anything
with them at all.

680
00:43:12,835 --> 00:43:15,470
Girls didn't take part
in that where I came from.

681
00:43:15,504 --> 00:43:18,806
Well, I'm Lord
of the Vale.

682
00:43:18,841 --> 00:43:22,143
When I grow up, I'll be able to fly
anybody who bothers me.

683
00:43:22,177 --> 00:43:24,512
Or you.
When we get married,

684
00:43:24,546 --> 00:43:26,314
you can tell me
if you don't like somebody

685
00:43:26,348 --> 00:43:28,616
and then we can bring them
back here and, whoosh!

686
00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:30,485
Right through
the Moon Door.

687
00:43:32,187 --> 00:43:34,121
I like the sound of that.

688
00:43:34,156 --> 00:43:35,890
Let's put a Moon Door
in your Winterfell.

689
00:43:35,924 --> 00:43:37,358
All right.

690
00:43:37,392 --> 00:43:39,360
It can go in here
in this big tower.

691
00:43:39,394 --> 00:43:41,462
Careful.
You've ruined it.

692
00:43:41,497 --> 00:43:42,930
Now I'm going to have
to rebuild the whole thing.

693
00:43:42,965 --> 00:43:44,499
- I didn't ruin it.
- You did.

694
00:43:44,533 --> 00:43:46,501
It was already ruined
because it didn't have a Moon Door.

695
00:43:46,535 --> 00:43:47,869
I was fixing it.

696
00:43:47,903 --> 00:43:49,237
Knocking things down
isn't fixing them.

697
00:43:49,271 --> 00:43:51,038
- It's ruining them.
- I didn't ruin it!

698
00:43:51,073 --> 00:43:53,541
- You're being stupid.
- I didn't ruin it!

699
00:44:03,919 --> 00:44:06,654
Robin, I'm sorry, I--

700
00:44:07,623 --> 00:44:09,290
<i>Children.</i>

701
00:44:11,827 --> 00:44:15,263
- <i>I hit him.</i>
- Yes, I saw.

702
00:44:15,297 --> 00:44:16,631
I shouldn't have done that.

703
00:44:16,665 --> 00:44:19,767
No, his mother
should have

704
00:44:19,801 --> 00:44:22,103
a long time ago.

705
00:44:22,137 --> 00:44:25,506
Consider it a step
in the right direction.

706
00:44:26,975 --> 00:44:28,676
If he tells Aunt Lysa...

707
00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:31,078
Let me worry about
Aunt Lysa.

708
00:44:32,481 --> 00:44:35,216
I was trying to remember
what everything looked like.

709
00:44:36,485 --> 00:44:38,519
I'll never see it again.

710
00:44:40,255 --> 00:44:43,324
A lot can happen
between now and never.

711
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:47,628
If you want to build
a better home,

712
00:44:47,663 --> 00:44:50,498
first you must
demolish the old one.

713
00:44:52,467 --> 00:44:55,536
Why did you really
kill Joffrey?

714
00:44:59,641 --> 00:45:01,742
Tell me why.

715
00:45:06,014 --> 00:45:09,584
I loved your mother more
than you could ever know.

716
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:14,922
Given the opportunity,
what do we do to those

717
00:45:14,990 --> 00:45:16,991
who've hurt
the ones we love?

718
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,734
In a better world,

719
00:45:26,768 --> 00:45:29,136
one where love

720
00:45:29,171 --> 00:45:33,107
could overcome
strength and duty,

721
00:45:33,141 --> 00:45:36,877
you might have been
my child.

722
00:45:39,881 --> 00:45:42,416
But we don't live
in that world.

723
00:45:53,428 --> 00:45:56,430
You're more beautiful
than she ever was.

724
00:45:58,266 --> 00:45:59,834
Lord Baelish...

725
00:45:59,868 --> 00:46:01,836
Call me Petyr.

726
00:46:28,764 --> 00:46:31,232
<i>You wanted</i>
<i>to see me, Aunt Lysa?</i>

727
00:46:32,734 --> 00:46:34,835
Come here, Sansa.

728
00:46:48,884 --> 00:46:51,352
Do you know how far
the fall is?

729
00:46:53,221 --> 00:46:54,355
No.

730
00:46:54,389 --> 00:46:56,590
<i>Neither do I, precisely.</i>

731
00:46:56,625 --> 00:46:59,160
<i>Hundreds of feet.</i>

732
00:46:59,194 --> 00:47:01,328
It's fascinating

733
00:47:01,363 --> 00:47:05,232
what happens to bodies when they
hit the rocks from such a height.

734
00:47:05,267 --> 00:47:07,301
The impact breaks them
right apart.

735
00:47:07,335 --> 00:47:10,771
Like eggs dropped
on the floor.

736
00:47:10,806 --> 00:47:13,207
Sometimes pieces
remain intact.

737
00:47:13,275 --> 00:47:15,910
You'll find the head
sitting on its own.

738
00:47:15,944 --> 00:47:18,045
Every hair in place.

739
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:20,981
Blue eyes staring
at nothing.

740
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:32,526
I know what you did.

741
00:47:34,730 --> 00:47:36,530
I'm so sorry, Aunt Lysa.

742
00:47:36,565 --> 00:47:39,400
I never should have hit Robin,
I know it. I promise it won't happen--

743
00:47:39,434 --> 00:47:41,168
Don't be coy with me,
you little whore.

744
00:47:41,203 --> 00:47:43,637
You kissed him.
You kissed Petyr.

745
00:47:43,672 --> 00:47:45,873
- I didn't. You don't understand.
- I saw you.

746
00:47:45,907 --> 00:47:49,210
You can't lie to me because
I saw it with my own eyes.

747
00:47:49,244 --> 00:47:51,078
- He kissed me. I pulled away.
- Liar!

748
00:47:51,113 --> 00:47:54,014
Whore! He is mine!

749
00:47:54,049 --> 00:47:56,550
My father, my husband,
my sister,

750
00:47:56,585 --> 00:47:58,719
they all stood between us
and now they're all dead.

751
00:47:58,754 --> 00:48:02,823
That's what happens to people
who stand between Petyr and me.

752
00:48:02,858 --> 00:48:04,525
Look down!

753
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:06,961
Look down!
Look down! Look down!

754
00:48:06,995 --> 00:48:09,864
<i>Lysa!</i>

755
00:48:09,898 --> 00:48:12,533
Let her go.

756
00:48:15,437 --> 00:48:17,571
You want her?

757
00:48:17,606 --> 00:48:21,242
This empty-headed child?

758
00:48:21,276 --> 00:48:22,777
Let her go.

759
00:48:22,811 --> 00:48:25,613
She's just like her mother.
She'll never love you.

760
00:48:25,647 --> 00:48:28,182
I lied for you.

761
00:48:28,216 --> 00:48:30,217
<i>I killed for you.</i>

762
00:48:30,252 --> 00:48:32,586
Why did you bring
her here? Why?

763
00:48:32,621 --> 00:48:34,555
I'll send her away.

764
00:48:35,857 --> 00:48:38,425
I swear on my life.

765
00:48:39,394 --> 00:48:41,929
I swear to all the gods.

766
00:48:43,298 --> 00:48:44,832
Let her go, Lysa.

767
00:49:02,651 --> 00:49:05,252
Oh, my sweet wife.

768
00:49:07,522 --> 00:49:10,991
My sweet, silly wife.

769
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:20,768
I have only loved
one woman...

770
00:49:21,703 --> 00:49:23,537
only one,

771
00:49:23,572 --> 00:49:25,973
my entire life.

772
00:49:31,246 --> 00:49:32,746
Your sister.
