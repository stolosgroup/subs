1
00:00:00,745 --> 00:00:02,079
<i>The raven brings</i>
<i>the sight.</i>

2
00:00:02,113 --> 00:00:03,914
Seeing things that
haven't happened yet?

3
00:00:03,948 --> 00:00:05,582
<i>Things that happened</i>
<i>long before you were born</i>

4
00:00:05,616 --> 00:00:08,684
or things that are happening right now
thousands of miles away.

5
00:00:08,718 --> 00:00:10,720
You have the sight, too?

6
00:00:10,754 --> 00:00:13,522
Orell says there are crows
patrolling on the Wall.

7
00:00:13,556 --> 00:00:15,958
If I knew where on the Wall we
were heading, I could tell you.

8
00:00:15,992 --> 00:00:18,660
- You'd like to know that.
- He's no crow.

9
00:00:20,429 --> 00:00:22,830
We'll find out soon enough.

10
00:00:22,865 --> 00:00:25,933
- How long will you be gone?
- I don't know.

11
00:00:25,968 --> 00:00:28,069
You told me your magic
requires a king's blood.

12
00:00:28,103 --> 00:00:29,737
- Yes.
- I'm the one true king.

13
00:00:29,771 --> 00:00:32,339
But there are others
with your blood in their veins.

14
00:00:32,374 --> 00:00:36,109
The Tyrells are plotting
to marry Sansa Stark to Ser Loras.

15
00:00:36,144 --> 00:00:38,644
<i>We need to find Sansa Stark</i>
<i>a different husband.</i>

16
00:00:38,669 --> 00:00:40,047
You can't mean it.

17
00:00:40,048 --> 00:00:42,349
Tyrion will do
as he's bid, as will you.

18
00:00:42,383 --> 00:00:44,485
- What do you mean?
- You'll marry Ser Loras.

19
00:00:44,519 --> 00:00:46,454
- I will not.
- Yes, you will.

20
00:00:46,488 --> 00:00:49,323
Lord Bolton, I give you
the Kingslayer.

21
00:00:49,358 --> 00:00:51,926
Pick him up, Locke.
Cut her free.

22
00:00:51,961 --> 00:00:53,761
Find suitable rooms
for our guests.

23
00:00:53,796 --> 00:00:55,363
We'll speak later.

24
00:00:55,397 --> 00:00:56,495
How far
is it to Deepwood Motte?

25
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,766
Not far, my lord.

26
00:00:57,767 --> 00:01:00,201
<i>Your sister's waiting</i>
<i>for you there.</i>

27
00:01:01,771 --> 00:01:04,039
Put him back where he belongs.

28
00:01:05,174 --> 00:01:08,243
Rickard Karstark,
I sentence you to die.

29
00:01:09,612 --> 00:01:12,481
I need men to replace the Karstarks
who marched home.

30
00:01:12,515 --> 00:01:14,416
There is only one person
in this kingdom

31
00:01:14,451 --> 00:01:15,817
with that kind of army.

32
00:01:15,852 --> 00:01:17,853
The man whose daughter
I was supposed to marry--

33
00:01:17,887 --> 00:01:19,054
Walder Frey.

34
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:22,924
I shall have
your head for this!

35
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:26,594
We have to go.
Now!

36
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:33,066
Guilty! Guilty!
Guilty! Guilty!

37
00:01:34,736 --> 00:01:36,636
- Lord, cast your light...
<i>- I thought he killed you.</i>

38
00:01:36,671 --> 00:01:38,404
- He did.
- But how...?

39
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:40,106
How many times
have you brought me back?

40
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:41,841
It's the Lord of Light
brings you back.

41
00:01:41,875 --> 00:01:44,778
- How many times?
- <i>This makes six.</i>

You've got too much
wood in there.

48
00:03:51,941 --> 00:03:55,576
But the more wood,
the bigger the fire.

Someone built your fires
for you growing up?

53
00:04:24,108 --> 00:04:26,977
It doesn't get so cold
down in the Reach.

54
00:04:28,179 --> 00:04:30,847
And there were
servants, of course.

I knew you were highborn.

56
00:04:36,687 --> 00:04:40,557
Oh, I found something
at the Fist of the First Men.

57
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:45,094
Buried treasure.

58
00:04:45,129 --> 00:04:47,631
Thousands of years old.

59
00:04:47,665 --> 00:04:49,265
I think.

60
00:04:50,434 --> 00:04:52,369
What does it do?

61
00:04:53,604 --> 00:04:56,105
I'm not sure
that it does anything.

62
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:58,341
It's beautiful, though,
isn't it?

63
00:05:06,417 --> 00:05:09,619
- How much longer?
- Not so far.

64
00:05:09,653 --> 00:05:11,821
A few more days.

65
00:05:11,855 --> 00:05:15,192
Is the Wall
as big as they say?

66
00:05:15,226 --> 00:05:17,094
Bigger.

67
00:05:18,363 --> 00:05:21,332
So big you can't even see
the top sometimes.

68
00:05:21,366 --> 00:05:23,368
It's hidden in clouds.

69
00:05:25,237 --> 00:05:26,738
You're playing with me.

70
00:05:26,772 --> 00:05:30,943
I'm not.
It's 700 feet high,

71
00:05:30,977 --> 00:05:33,279
all made of ice.

72
00:05:33,347 --> 00:05:35,982
On a warm day
you can see it weeping.

73
00:05:40,588 --> 00:05:43,890
Castle Black
is nice enough.

74
00:05:43,924 --> 00:05:47,260
They keep a fire burning
in the long hall

75
00:05:47,294 --> 00:05:49,029
day and night.

76
00:05:49,063 --> 00:05:53,200
And Hobb makes
venison stew

77
00:05:53,234 --> 00:05:55,001
with onions.

78
00:05:55,036 --> 00:05:56,436
Very tasty.

79

the brothers will sing.

- Do you sing?
- No.

82
00:06:05,512 --> 00:06:08,314
No, no, no.
Not very well.

That's not how
you skin a rabbit.

96
00:07:03,203 --> 00:07:04,671
I know how
to skin a rabbit.

97
00:07:04,705 --> 00:07:07,040
Not by the looks of it.

98
00:07:22,656 --> 00:07:25,157
You grow up
north of the Wall,

99
00:07:25,192 --> 00:07:27,026
you learn the proper
way to handle game.

100
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,495
I didn't see any game
before I got here.

101
00:07:30,964 --> 00:07:33,099
If I had a bow, I could have shot
a dozen rabbits.

102
00:07:33,133 --> 00:07:34,667
Well, I made
this bow myself.

103
00:07:34,701 --> 00:07:36,802
Guess you don't learn
how to do that north of the Wall.

104
00:07:36,836 --> 00:07:38,970
You learn how to use
your fists, though.

105
00:07:39,005 --> 00:07:41,039
Oh, you're gonna punch
the rabbits to death?

106
00:07:41,074 --> 00:07:42,541
I had someone else in mind.

107
00:07:42,575 --> 00:07:44,042
Well, someone else
is sitting right here.

108
00:07:44,077 --> 00:07:46,545
You're both very good
at skinning rabbits.

109
00:07:46,579 --> 00:07:49,414
Some of us are just
a little better.

110
00:07:49,448 --> 00:07:51,416
Well, some of us would say
thank you when someone else

111
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:53,518
hunts down their
breakfast for them.

112
00:07:53,552 --> 00:07:55,487
Or don't they teach you to say
 thank you north of the Wall?

113
00:07:55,521 --> 00:07:59,157
You've got a big mouth, girl,
and too many teeth.

114
00:07:59,191 --> 00:08:01,359
- Stop it!
- Hodor.

115
00:08:01,393 --> 00:08:03,895
You've been fighting since you met.
Just stop it.

116
00:08:03,929 --> 00:08:06,731
Lady Reed here's got
a stick so far up her ass,

117
00:08:06,765 --> 00:08:08,232
it's a wonder her feet
touch the ground.

118
00:08:08,267 --> 00:08:10,602
You've been nasty
to her every day.

119
00:08:10,636 --> 00:08:12,036
Of course she's nasty back.

120
00:08:12,071 --> 00:08:13,671
Me? It's my fault?

121
00:08:13,705 --> 00:08:15,873
First time I met her,
she put a knife to my throat.

122
00:08:15,907 --> 00:08:18,242
First time I met you,
you held a knife at me.

123
00:08:20,379 --> 00:08:22,113
We can't fight each other.

124
00:08:22,147 --> 00:08:24,416
We'll never make it
to the Wall.

125
00:08:25,451 --> 00:08:27,185
I want you both
to make peace.

126
00:08:36,263 --> 00:08:38,364
Your way of skinning rabbits
is quicker than mine.

127
00:08:38,398 --> 00:08:41,000
- I said so, didn't I?
- Osha!

128
00:08:44,504 --> 00:08:46,171
You're a good
little hunter.

129
00:08:46,205 --> 00:08:47,639
Thank you.

130
00:08:47,674 --> 00:08:49,107
See?

131
00:08:49,142 --> 00:08:50,875
Not so hard, is it?
Thank you.

132
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:52,310
Don't push me.

133
00:09:03,188 --> 00:09:04,722
Shh.

134
00:09:04,756 --> 00:09:06,791
I'm right here with you.

135
00:09:06,825 --> 00:09:08,759
What's happening?

136
00:09:08,794 --> 00:09:10,962
I'm right here with you.

137
00:09:12,731 --> 00:09:13,864
What's wrong with him?

138
00:09:17,302 --> 00:09:20,070
The visions
take their toll.

139
00:09:21,673 --> 00:09:23,407
He's having one now?

140
00:09:43,561 --> 00:09:45,595
I saw Jon Snow.

141
00:09:46,563 --> 00:09:48,598
You saw him?

142
00:09:48,632 --> 00:09:50,199
At Castle Black?

143
00:09:51,434 --> 00:09:53,902
He was on the wrong side
of the Wall...

144
00:09:55,038 --> 00:09:56,538
surrounded by enemies.

145
00:10:05,982 --> 00:10:09,718
Used to be you couldn't
find a tree within a mile of the Wall.

146
00:10:09,752 --> 00:10:12,888
Crows would come out
every morning with axes.

147
00:10:16,158 --> 00:10:19,627
Your flock gets smaller
every year.

148
00:10:26,069 --> 00:10:27,736
You ever climbed it before?

149
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:29,839
No.

150
00:10:29,873 --> 00:10:32,809
But Tormund's done it
half a hundred times.

151
00:10:38,616 --> 00:10:40,618
You're afraid.

152
00:10:42,421 --> 00:10:44,855
- Aren't you?
- <i>Aye.</i>

153
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:47,625
It's a long way up
and a long way down.

154
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:50,028
But I've waited
my whole life

155
00:10:50,062 --> 00:10:52,063
to see the world
from up there.

156
00:10:56,502 --> 00:10:59,571
Here, sit down.
I brought a pair for you.

157
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:03,875
They're too big for you,
but they're good.

158
00:11:03,909 --> 00:11:05,744
You kill someone
for them?

159
00:11:05,778 --> 00:11:07,946
Nah.

160
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,748
<i>I didn't kill him,</i>

161
00:11:09,782 --> 00:11:12,150
but I bet his balls
are still bruised.

162
00:11:18,925 --> 00:11:21,794
He wasn't good to me
the way you're good to me.

163
00:11:23,163 --> 00:11:26,432
He didn't do that thing
you do with your tongue.

164
00:11:27,567 --> 00:11:29,235
Can we not talk
about that here?

165
00:11:29,269 --> 00:11:31,738
"Can we not talk
about that here?

166
00:11:31,772 --> 00:11:33,573
I'm Jon Snow.

167
00:11:33,608 --> 00:11:35,609
I've killed dead men
and Qhorin Halfhand,

168
00:11:35,643 --> 00:11:37,745
but I'm scared
of naked girls."

169
00:11:37,779 --> 00:11:39,280
Did I seem scared
the other day?

170
00:11:39,314 --> 00:11:40,948
You were trembling
like a leaf.

171
00:11:40,982 --> 00:11:42,516
Only in the beginning.

172
00:11:44,052 --> 00:11:45,920
Only in the beginning.

173
00:11:48,491 --> 00:11:51,059
You're a proper lover,
Jon Snow.

174
00:11:51,093 --> 00:11:53,962
And don't worry.

175
00:11:53,996 --> 00:11:56,064
Your secret's safe
with me.

176
00:11:56,099 --> 00:11:58,533
What secret?

177
00:12:00,235 --> 00:12:02,036
Do you think I'm as dumb
as all those girls

178
00:12:02,071 --> 00:12:06,006
in silk dresses
you knew growing up?

179
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:08,976
You're loyal
and you're brave.

180
00:12:13,081 --> 00:12:14,848
You didn't stop
being a crow

181
00:12:14,883 --> 00:12:17,584
the day you walked
into Mance Rayder's tent.

182
00:12:24,192 --> 00:12:26,627
But I'm your woman now,
Jon Snow.

183
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:32,133
You're going to be loyal
to your woman.

184
00:12:36,972 --> 00:12:39,808
The Night's Watch
don't care if you live or die.

185
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:43,211
Mance Rayder don't care
if I live or die.

186
00:12:43,245 --> 00:12:44,813
We're just soldiers
in their armies

187
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:47,149
and there's plenty more
to carry on if we go down.

188
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:57,360
It's you and me

189
00:12:57,394 --> 00:13:00,463
that matters
to me and you.

190
00:13:04,101 --> 00:13:06,435
Don't ever betray me.

191
00:13:13,844 --> 00:13:15,244
I won't.

192
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:18,347
'Cause I'll cut
your pretty cock right off

193
00:13:18,382 --> 00:13:20,683
and wear it
'round my neck.

194
00:13:32,427 --> 00:13:34,261
Sink your metal deep

195
00:13:34,296 --> 00:13:37,831
and make sure it holds
before taking your next step.

196
00:13:38,733 --> 00:13:40,367
And if you fall,

197
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:42,136
don't scream.

198
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:45,807
You don't want that to be the
last thing she remembers.

199
00:13:58,489 --> 00:14:00,089
<i>Joffrey.</i>

200
00:14:03,793 --> 00:14:06,095
Cersei.

201
00:14:06,129 --> 00:14:07,997
<i>Ilyn Payne.</i>

202
00:14:09,266 --> 00:14:11,133
You're good.

203
00:14:15,339 --> 00:14:18,474
You're not as good
as you think you are.

204
00:14:20,177 --> 00:14:22,811
Face, tits, balls--

205
00:14:22,846 --> 00:14:24,413
I hit 'em right
where I wanted to.

206
00:14:24,448 --> 00:14:28,183
Aye, but you took
your sweet time of it.

207
00:14:28,217 --> 00:14:31,720
You won't be fighting
straw men, little lady.

208
00:14:33,656 --> 00:14:35,990
Show me your position.

209
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,561
Keep your elbow high.

210
00:14:40,595 --> 00:14:43,564
You want your back
doing the hard labor.

211
00:14:45,533 --> 00:14:47,500
You're holding.

212
00:14:47,535 --> 00:14:49,269
Never hold.

213
00:14:49,303 --> 00:14:52,238
- What?
- Your muscles tense up when you hold.

214
00:14:52,272 --> 00:14:54,540
Pull the string back
to the center of your chin

215
00:14:54,574 --> 00:14:56,041
and release.

216
00:14:56,075 --> 00:14:57,976
Never hold.

217
00:14:58,011 --> 00:15:00,045
But I have to aim.

218
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:01,747
Never aim.

219
00:15:01,781 --> 00:15:03,348
Never aim?

220
00:15:03,383 --> 00:15:07,119
Your eye knows where
it wants the arrow to go.

221
00:15:07,153 --> 00:15:09,354
Trust your eye.

222
00:15:13,426 --> 00:15:15,560
There's someone out there.

223
00:15:33,545 --> 00:15:36,614
That's about far enough.

224
00:15:41,386 --> 00:15:42,753
We come as friends.

225
00:15:42,787 --> 00:15:44,588
<i>Begging</i>
<i>your pardon, m'lady,</i>

226
00:15:44,622 --> 00:15:46,723
but we'll be
the judge of that.

227
00:15:49,026 --> 00:15:50,693
Valar morghulis.

228
00:15:50,728 --> 00:15:52,762
<i>Valar dohaeris.</i>

229
00:16:28,632 --> 00:16:31,568
My friends here
don't speak High Valyrian.

230
00:16:33,204 --> 00:16:35,338
<i>Why are you here,</i>
<i>my lady?</i>

231
00:16:47,952 --> 00:16:50,053
Forgive my manners.

232
00:16:51,155 --> 00:16:53,089
I don't see many ladies
these days.

233
00:16:53,124 --> 00:16:54,991
Lucky for the ladies.

234
00:17:24,454 --> 00:17:26,555
How many times has
the Lord brought him back?

235
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:28,424
Six.

236
00:17:53,918 --> 00:17:56,320
I've always been
a terrible priest.

237
00:17:57,622 --> 00:18:00,224
Drank too much rum.

238
00:18:00,258 --> 00:18:02,359
Fucked all the whores
in King's Landing.

239
00:18:02,393 --> 00:18:05,095
It's a terrible
thing to say,

240
00:18:05,129 --> 00:18:09,031
but by the time I came
to Westeros, I didn't believe in our Lord.

241
00:18:11,768 --> 00:18:14,536
I decided that He,
that all the gods,

242
00:18:14,571 --> 00:18:18,107
<i>were stories we told</i>
<i>the children to make them behave.</i>

243
00:18:19,909 --> 00:18:22,879
So I wore the robes and every now
and then I'd recite the prayers,

244
00:18:22,913 --> 00:18:25,982
but it was just for show.

245
00:18:27,752 --> 00:18:30,721
A spectacle
for the locals.

246
00:18:30,755 --> 00:18:34,191
Until the Mountain drove a lance
through this one's heart.

247
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:41,733
I knelt beside
his cold body

248
00:18:41,767 --> 00:18:43,568
and said the old words.

249
00:18:43,602 --> 00:18:46,304
Not because I believed
in them, but...

250
00:18:48,674 --> 00:18:51,577
he was my friend

251
00:18:51,611 --> 00:18:53,913
and he was dead.

252
00:18:55,115 --> 00:18:57,050
And they were
the only words I knew.

253
00:18:58,585 --> 00:19:01,587
And for the first time
in my life, the Lord replied.

254
00:19:03,823 --> 00:19:05,924
Beric's eyes opened

255
00:19:05,959 --> 00:19:08,693
<i>and I knew the truth.</i>

256
00:19:08,728 --> 00:19:11,730
Our god
is the one true god.

257
00:19:14,066 --> 00:19:16,467
And all men
must serve Him.

258
00:19:23,542 --> 00:19:26,545
You've been
to the other side.

259
00:19:27,413 --> 00:19:29,548
The other side?

260
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:33,452
There is no other side.

261
00:19:34,554 --> 00:19:37,155
I have been
to the darkness, my lady.

262
00:19:41,127 --> 00:19:43,963
He sent you to us
for a reason.

263
00:19:45,432 --> 00:19:47,767
You have someone
He needs.

264
00:19:49,203 --> 00:19:51,638
Bodkin point.

265
00:19:51,672 --> 00:19:54,575
Penetrates plate
at 200 yards.

266
00:19:58,413 --> 00:20:00,448
Can you make 'em?

267
00:20:00,482 --> 00:20:02,850
Yeah, nothing tricky
about it.

268
00:20:02,885 --> 00:20:05,186
Just need decent steel.

269
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,520
I'll get you the steel.

270
00:20:06,555 --> 00:20:08,790
<i>Come on.</i>

271
00:20:10,326 --> 00:20:12,060
<i>I don't like that woman.</i>

272
00:20:14,364 --> 00:20:16,932
That's 'cause
you're a girl.

273
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:18,700
What does that have
to do with anything?

274
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:26,574
Forgive me, lad.

275
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:33,447
What are you doing?
Let go of him.

276
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:35,116
- Tell them to stop.
- Come on.

277
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,950
He wants to be one of you.

278
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:39,252
He wants to join the Brotherhood.
Stop them!

279
00:20:39,287 --> 00:20:41,454
We serve
the Lord of Light

280
00:20:41,489 --> 00:20:43,690
and the Lord of Light
needs this boy.

281
00:20:43,724 --> 00:20:46,326
Did the Lord of Light
tell you that or did she?

282
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:55,435
You're not doing this
for your god.

283
00:20:55,469 --> 00:20:57,137
You're doing it for gold.

284
00:20:57,171 --> 00:20:59,339
We're doing it
for both, girl.

285
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:02,543
We can't defend the people
without weapons

286
00:21:02,577 --> 00:21:04,845
and horses and food.

287
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,550
And we can't get weapons
and horses and food without gold.

288
00:21:08,584 --> 00:21:11,519
You told me
this was a Brotherhood.

289
00:21:11,553 --> 00:21:14,022
You told me
I could be one of you.

290
00:21:20,497 --> 00:21:22,665
You are more
than they can ever be.

291
00:21:22,699 --> 00:21:25,567
They're just foot soldiers
in the great war.

292
00:21:25,602 --> 00:21:28,237
You will make kings
rise and fall.

293
00:21:40,016 --> 00:21:43,185
You're a witch.
You're going to hurt him.

294
00:21:48,258 --> 00:21:50,459
I see a darkness in you.

295
00:21:52,095 --> 00:21:54,930
And in that darkness,
eyes staring back at me--

296
00:21:54,965 --> 00:21:56,966
brown eyes,

297
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,270
blue eyes,
green eyes.

298
00:22:00,304 --> 00:22:03,473
Eyes you'll shut forever.

299
00:22:06,912 --> 00:22:09,013
We will meet again.

300
00:23:24,292 --> 00:23:26,960
You staring at my ass,
Jon Snow?

301
00:23:37,071 --> 00:23:38,738
You all right?

302
00:23:42,209 --> 00:23:44,710
Just seeing if you can
take a hit, lad.

303
00:23:58,325 --> 00:24:01,427
Sorry.
Were you sleeping?

304
00:24:01,461 --> 00:24:03,529
Wa--

305
00:24:05,165 --> 00:24:08,601
Wa--? Wa--?

306
00:24:09,737 --> 00:24:11,538
Water?

307
00:24:11,572 --> 00:24:13,607
You want some water.

308
00:24:16,144 --> 00:24:18,679
I wish I had
some for you.

309
00:24:32,662 --> 00:24:35,063
So let's play a game.

310
00:24:36,232 --> 00:24:39,468
Which body part
do you need the least?

311
00:24:41,071 --> 00:24:44,540
- Please.
- Please is not a body part.

312
00:24:44,575 --> 00:24:46,876
I'll tell you everything,
please.

313
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:51,447
But you've already
told me everything.

314
00:24:51,482 --> 00:24:53,983
<i>Remember?</i>

315
00:24:54,017 --> 00:24:56,453
Your daddy
was mean to you.

316
00:24:56,487 --> 00:24:59,823
The Starks didn't
appreciate you.

317
00:25:00,891 --> 00:25:03,460
One good bit, though.

318
00:25:03,494 --> 00:25:05,695
The Stark boys,

319
00:25:05,729 --> 00:25:08,431
they're still alive.

320
00:25:09,566 --> 00:25:13,568
Wouldn't that be
a hunt to remember?

321
00:25:13,602 --> 00:25:17,539
You failed, but I'm a better
hunter than you.

322
00:25:19,275 --> 00:25:21,276
<i>Now...</i>

323
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:23,278
how about
your little finger?

324
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:25,147
You don't use that
for much, do you?

325
00:25:25,181 --> 00:25:28,350
No? Good.
Let's start with that.

326
00:25:38,395 --> 00:25:41,063
You've been wondering
why you're here.

327
00:25:41,097 --> 00:25:43,599
<i>Haven't you?</i>

328
00:25:43,633 --> 00:25:45,467
<i>Where you are.</i>

329
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:47,269
Who I am.

330
00:25:47,304 --> 00:25:50,105
Why I'm doing
this to you.

331
00:25:51,708 --> 00:25:53,943
So guess.

332
00:25:53,977 --> 00:25:56,212
<i>If you guess right,</i>

333
00:25:56,246 --> 00:25:57,813
I'll tell you.

334
00:25:57,848 --> 00:26:00,816
By the old gods
and the new, I swear it.

335
00:26:02,752 --> 00:26:04,253
You win the game

336
00:26:04,287 --> 00:26:06,355
if you can
figure out who I am

337
00:26:06,389 --> 00:26:07,923
and why
I'm torturing you

338
00:26:07,958 --> 00:26:11,293
and I win the game if you beg
me to cut off your finger.

339
00:26:13,196 --> 00:26:16,966
If I win,
you'll let me go?

340
00:26:19,002 --> 00:26:21,770
If you think this has
a happy ending,

341
00:26:21,804 --> 00:26:24,806
you haven't been
paying attention.

342
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,474
Please.

343
00:26:26,509 --> 00:26:30,445
You say please again
and you'll wish you hadn't.

344
00:26:33,882 --> 00:26:36,050
You first.

345
00:26:36,084 --> 00:26:38,185
Where are we?

346
00:26:39,187 --> 00:26:41,789
- The North.
- Too vague.

347
00:26:41,823 --> 00:26:43,457
Deepwood Motte.

348
00:26:45,694 --> 00:26:47,928
Terrible guess.

349
00:26:55,604 --> 00:26:58,139
Now, where?

350
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:01,143
Last Hearth.

351
00:27:01,177 --> 00:27:04,246
Do I look like
a fucking Umber to you?

352
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:09,451
Karhold!

353
00:27:16,258 --> 00:27:17,992
Karhold?

354
00:27:20,796 --> 00:27:22,730
How did you know that?

355
00:27:24,133 --> 00:27:27,169
Did you see any banners
flying when we came in?

356
00:27:27,203 --> 00:27:28,803
No.

357
00:27:28,838 --> 00:27:31,406
It was just a guess.

358
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:34,944
Very good, Lord Theon.

359
00:27:37,481 --> 00:27:38,881
And who am I?

360
00:27:40,117 --> 00:27:42,084
Torrhen Karstark.

361
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:44,020
He's dead.

362
00:27:44,054 --> 00:27:46,656
Strangled by
the Kingslayer.

363
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:50,993
He was your brother.

364
00:27:55,331 --> 00:27:59,768
Your father
is Lord Rickard Karstark.

365
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:11,545
- You swore to tell me if I--
- You're right.

366
00:28:13,381 --> 00:28:17,217
Lord Rickard Karstark
is Robb Stark's bannerman.

367
00:28:17,251 --> 00:28:19,185
<i>I betrayed Robb.</i>

368
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:22,822
That's why you're
torturing me.

369
00:28:24,992 --> 00:28:26,793
Yes.

370
00:28:30,264 --> 00:28:31,965
You win.

371
00:28:42,343 --> 00:28:46,012
Of course, you forgot
to ask one question.

372
00:28:46,046 --> 00:28:49,549
You forgot to ask
if I'm a liar.

373
00:28:55,323 --> 00:28:57,958
I'm afraid I am.

374
00:28:59,927 --> 00:29:03,163
Everything I told you
is a lie.

375
00:29:05,867 --> 00:29:08,670
This isn't happening
to you for a reason.

376
00:29:08,704 --> 00:29:12,440
Well, one reason--
I enjoy it.

377
00:29:12,475 --> 00:29:15,711
Please, cut it off!
Cut it off! Cut it off!

378
00:29:21,851 --> 00:29:23,452
I win.

379
00:29:23,486 --> 00:29:26,155
Thank you for riding
here so quickly.

380
00:29:26,189 --> 00:29:28,690
I know travel
isn't easy in these times.

381
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:31,460
The roads are crawling
with cutthroats and bandits.

382
00:29:31,494 --> 00:29:34,964
But when the King
of the North summons us, we come.

383
00:29:34,998 --> 00:29:37,399
<i>Our father has</i>
<i>instructed us to tell you</i>

384
00:29:37,434 --> 00:29:40,169
that his alliance
with the North can continue

385
00:29:40,203 --> 00:29:42,872
if his terms are met.

386
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:45,841
Lord Frey requires
a formal apology

387
00:29:45,876 --> 00:29:47,877
for your violation
of your sacred oath

388
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:49,245
to marry one
of his daughters.

389
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:52,381
Of course. He deserves as much.
I was in the wrong.

390
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:54,850
As restitution
for this betrayal,

391
00:29:54,885 --> 00:29:57,987
<i>he demands Harrenhal</i>
<i>and all its attendant lands.</i>

392
00:29:58,021 --> 00:30:01,356
- I don't think that's--
- We are fighting for the North.

393
00:30:02,392 --> 00:30:04,359
Harrenhal is not
in the North.

394
00:30:04,393 --> 00:30:08,063
It is his
once the war is over

395
00:30:08,097 --> 00:30:10,732
and we have no further
strategic need for it.

396
00:30:11,667 --> 00:30:14,568
And there's
something else.

397
00:30:14,603 --> 00:30:17,404
We will do whatever we can
to give Lord Frey what he needs.

398
00:30:17,439 --> 00:30:21,008
Not what, whom.

399
00:30:22,578 --> 00:30:24,412
What?

400
00:30:28,317 --> 00:30:31,386
No.

401
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:33,655
Our father requires
Lord Edmure to wed

402
00:30:33,689 --> 00:30:35,624
one of his daughters--
Roslin.

403
00:30:35,658 --> 00:30:37,493
How old is she?

404
00:30:37,527 --> 00:30:38,761
19.

405
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:40,362
Could I see her first?

406
00:30:40,396 --> 00:30:41,530
You want to count
her teeth?

407
00:30:41,564 --> 00:30:44,299
<i>We depart for the Twins</i>
<i>in the morning.</i>

408
00:30:44,334 --> 00:30:46,368
<i>We need an answer</i>
<i>before we leave</i>

409
00:30:46,402 --> 00:30:48,102
and a wedding not more
than a fortnight thereafter

410
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:50,171
or this alliance
is at an end.

411
00:30:50,205 --> 00:30:52,774
Your father does realize
we're in the middle of a war?

412
00:30:52,808 --> 00:30:55,476
Father is old.

413
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:57,511
It will put
his heart at peace

414
00:30:57,545 --> 00:31:00,413
if he could see her wed
to a good husband.

415
00:31:00,448 --> 00:31:03,283
And his recent experience
has made him wary

416
00:31:03,351 --> 00:31:05,219
<i>of long engagements.</i>

417
00:31:05,253 --> 00:31:07,054
He has every right to be.

418
00:31:07,088 --> 00:31:10,390
Please excuse us
while we discuss it.

419
00:31:26,942 --> 00:31:30,511
Why should I let that old
ferret choose my bride for me?

420
00:31:30,546 --> 00:31:33,615
At the very least, I should be
offered the same choice you were.

421
00:31:33,649 --> 00:31:35,083
I'm his liege lord.

422
00:31:35,117 --> 00:31:37,318
He's a proud man
and we've wounded him.

423
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:39,320
I didn't wound him.

424
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:40,989
My answer is no.

425
00:31:45,261 --> 00:31:46,961
Listen to me

426
00:31:46,996 --> 00:31:49,965
and listen very carefully.
You--

427
00:31:49,999 --> 00:31:52,701
The laws of gods and men
are very clear.

428
00:31:52,735 --> 00:31:55,203
No man can compel
another man to marry.

429
00:31:55,238 --> 00:31:57,806
The laws of my fist
are about to compel your teeth.

430
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:01,042
It's all right.
You heard him.

431
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:04,279
If you refuse, our alliance with
the Freys is dead.

432
00:32:04,313 --> 00:32:07,715
He's wanted me for one
of his daughters since I was 12.

433
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:10,518
He's not gonna stop
wanting it now.

434
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:12,921
When I say no,
he will come back

435
00:32:12,955 --> 00:32:14,956
and offer me a daughter
of my choosing.

436
00:32:14,991 --> 00:32:16,825
You're willing to risk
our freedom

437
00:32:16,859 --> 00:32:19,294
and our lives for a chance
at a prettier wife?

438
00:32:19,328 --> 00:32:21,663
I have a war to fight.

439
00:32:21,697 --> 00:32:23,698
We can't win it
without them.

440
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:25,567
I have no time to haggle.

441
00:32:25,601 --> 00:32:27,736
You said you wanted to make
amends for the Stone Mill.

442
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:31,674
You recall that
heroic engagement?

443
00:32:35,079 --> 00:32:38,615
I had something
less permanent in mind.

444
00:32:38,649 --> 00:32:41,084
I've won every battle,

445
00:32:41,118 --> 00:32:42,953
but I'm losing this war.

446
00:32:44,756 --> 00:32:47,958
If we don't do this
and do it now,

447
00:32:47,992 --> 00:32:50,060
we're lost.

448
00:32:55,466 --> 00:32:57,334
I'll marry her.

449
00:32:57,368 --> 00:33:00,270
You're paying
for my sins, Uncle.

450
00:33:00,304 --> 00:33:03,140
It's not fair or right.

451
00:33:03,174 --> 00:33:04,975
I'll remember it.

452
00:33:10,948 --> 00:33:12,616
<i>I see my men have</i>
<i>finally found you</i>

453
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:14,718
<i>something appropriate</i>
<i>to wear.</i>

454
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:18,655
Yes. Most kind of them.

455
00:33:18,689 --> 00:33:20,756
You're a Stark
bannerman, Lord Bolton.

456
00:33:20,791 --> 00:33:23,426
I am acting on
Lady Stark's orders

457
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,461
<i>to return Jaime Lannister</i>
<i>to King's Landing.</i>

458
00:33:25,495 --> 00:33:29,097
When King Robb left Harrenhal,
his mother was his prisoner.

459
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:30,732
If she wasn't his mother,

460
00:33:30,766 --> 00:33:32,867
<i>he'd have hanged her</i>
<i>for treason.</i>

461
00:33:40,075 --> 00:33:42,342
I should send you
back to Robb Stark.

462
00:33:42,376 --> 00:33:44,611
You should.

463
00:33:44,646 --> 00:33:47,080
But instead,
you're sitting here

464
00:33:47,115 --> 00:33:49,750
watching me fail at dinner.

465
00:33:49,784 --> 00:33:51,952
Why might that be?

466
00:33:51,986 --> 00:33:53,854
Wars cost money.

467
00:33:53,888 --> 00:33:55,856
Many people would pay
a great deal for you.

468
00:33:55,890 --> 00:33:58,559
We both know
who would pay the most.

469
00:34:00,095 --> 00:34:01,662
<i>Or make you pay the most</i>

470
00:34:01,696 --> 00:34:03,363
if he found out
you had captured me

471
00:34:03,398 --> 00:34:05,632
and sent me back up north
for a summary execution.

472
00:34:05,667 --> 00:34:08,035
You're right.

473
00:34:08,069 --> 00:34:11,872
Perhaps the safest thing to do is to
kill you both and burn your bodies.

474
00:34:11,907 --> 00:34:13,841
It would be,

475
00:34:13,876 --> 00:34:17,178
if you honestly believed my father
would never find out about it.

476
00:34:17,212 --> 00:34:19,880
King Robb is keeping
your father quite busy.

477
00:34:19,915 --> 00:34:22,249
He doesn't have time
for anything else.

478
00:34:22,284 --> 00:34:24,452
He'll make time for you.

479
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:29,290
As soon as you're
well enough to travel,

480
00:34:29,325 --> 00:34:32,127
<i>I will allow you</i>
<i>to go to King's Landing</i>

481
00:34:32,161 --> 00:34:35,664
as restitution for the mistakes
my soldiers made.

482
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:39,067
And you will swear to tell
your father the truth,

483
00:34:39,102 --> 00:34:41,637
that I had nothing
to do with your maiming.

484
00:34:48,411 --> 00:34:51,079
- Shall we drink on it?
- I don't partake.

485
00:34:52,916 --> 00:34:56,619
You do understand how suspicious
that is to ordinary people?

486
00:34:58,088 --> 00:35:00,089
Very well.

487
00:35:00,123 --> 00:35:02,158
My lady,

488
00:35:02,192 --> 00:35:05,261
may our journey continue
without further incident.

489
00:35:05,295 --> 00:35:07,029
Oh, she won't be
going with you.

490
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:09,765
I am charged with
bringing Ser Jaime to--

491
00:35:09,799 --> 00:35:12,567
<i>You are charged</i>
<i>with abetting treason.</i>

492
00:35:12,602 --> 00:35:14,736
I'm afraid I must insist.

493
00:35:14,770 --> 00:35:17,438
<i>You're in no place</i>
<i>to insist on anything.</i>

494
00:35:17,472 --> 00:35:19,607
I would have hoped
you'd learned your lesson

495
00:35:19,641 --> 00:35:23,477
about overplaying
your position.

496
00:35:27,449 --> 00:35:29,617
<i>- Impossible.</i>
- Why?

497
00:35:29,651 --> 00:35:31,986
My grandson is the pride
of Highgarden.

498
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:35,156
<i>The most desirable bachelor</i>
<i>in all seven kingdoms.</i>

499
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:37,792
- Your daughter--
- Is rich,

500
00:35:37,826 --> 00:35:41,562
the most beautiful woman
in all seven kingdoms...

501
00:35:42,798 --> 00:35:44,598
and the mother
of the king.

502
00:35:44,633 --> 00:35:46,033
Old.

503
00:35:46,902 --> 00:35:47,902
Old?

504
00:35:47,936 --> 00:35:51,005
Old.

505
00:35:51,039 --> 00:35:53,507
<i>I'm something of an expert</i>
<i>on the subject.</i>

506
00:35:53,541 --> 00:35:56,143
<i>Her change will be</i>
<i>upon her before long.</i>

507
00:35:56,178 --> 00:35:59,680
I'll spare you the details
of what will happen then.

508
00:35:59,714 --> 00:36:02,416
You men may have a stomach
for bloodshed and slaughter,

509
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:04,852
but this is another
matter entirely.

510
00:36:04,886 --> 00:36:08,522
The years punish us as well,
I promise you that.

511
00:36:10,759 --> 00:36:14,929
My stomach remains
quite strong, however.

512
00:36:14,963 --> 00:36:16,798
The only thing
that might turn it

513
00:36:16,832 --> 00:36:20,535
are details of your grandson's
nocturnal activities.

514
00:36:21,837 --> 00:36:23,771
- <i>Do you deny them?</i>
- Oh, not at all.

515
00:36:23,805 --> 00:36:25,840
A sword swallower
through and through.

516
00:36:25,874 --> 00:36:27,641
And a boy
with his affliction

517
00:36:27,676 --> 00:36:29,677
should be grateful
for the opportunity

518
00:36:29,711 --> 00:36:32,746
<i>to marry the most beautiful</i>
<i>woman in the kingdoms</i>

519
00:36:32,814 --> 00:36:34,647
and remove the stain
from his name.

520
00:36:34,682 --> 00:36:37,917
Did you grow up
with boy cousins, Lord Tywin?

521
00:36:37,951 --> 00:36:39,952
Sons of your father's
bannermen,

522
00:36:39,987 --> 00:36:41,821
squires, stable boys?

523
00:36:41,855 --> 00:36:44,156
Of course.

524
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:47,359
And you never...

525
00:36:47,394 --> 00:36:49,428
No.

526
00:36:49,462 --> 00:36:51,463
Not once?

527
00:36:51,498 --> 00:36:53,065
Not in any way?

528
00:36:53,099 --> 00:36:54,967
Never.

529
00:36:55,001 --> 00:36:57,937
I congratulate you
upon your restraint.

530
00:36:58,004 --> 00:37:00,239
But it's a natural thing,
two boys having a go

531
00:37:00,273 --> 00:37:01,907
at each other
beneath the sheets.

532
00:37:01,941 --> 00:37:04,510
Perhaps Highgarden
has a high tolerance

533
00:37:04,544 --> 00:37:06,445
for unnatural behavior.

534
00:37:06,479 --> 00:37:07,913
<i>I wouldn't say that.</i>

535
00:37:07,948 --> 00:37:10,216
True, we don't tie
ourselves in knots

536
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:13,419
over a discreet
bit of buggery, but...

537
00:37:15,088 --> 00:37:17,190
brothers and sisters--

538
00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:20,760
where I come from,
that stain

539
00:37:20,795 --> 00:37:23,263
would be very difficult
to wash out.

540
00:37:23,297 --> 00:37:25,899
I will not breathe
further life

541
00:37:25,934 --> 00:37:28,335
into a malicious lie
by discussing it.

542
00:37:30,205 --> 00:37:31,972
Lie or not,

543
00:37:32,006 --> 00:37:35,142
you must admit many people
find it quite convincing.

544
00:37:35,177 --> 00:37:37,712
Convincing enough
to put swords in their hands

545
00:37:37,746 --> 00:37:39,780
and send them off
to kill Lannisters

546
00:37:39,815 --> 00:37:42,850
and Tyrells thanks to
our new affiliation.

547
00:37:42,884 --> 00:37:44,952
I don't care
what people believe.

548
00:37:44,986 --> 00:37:47,821
And neither do you.

549
00:37:47,856 --> 00:37:51,425
As an authority on myself,
I must disagree.

550
00:37:51,493 --> 00:37:55,630
Now, if the rumors about
my children were true,

551
00:37:55,664 --> 00:37:58,566
then Joffrey
is no king at all

552
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:02,770
and House Tyrell is throwing its
prized flower into the dirt.

553
00:38:02,805 --> 00:38:06,508
And if Cersei is too old
to give Loras children,

554
00:38:06,542 --> 00:38:10,712
we're throwing another
prized flower into the dirt.

555
00:38:10,747 --> 00:38:14,283
It is a chance
we simply cannot take.

556
00:38:14,317 --> 00:38:16,852
The uncertainty
makes you uncomfortable.

557
00:38:18,255 --> 00:38:20,089
All right.

558
00:38:20,123 --> 00:38:22,657
I'll remove it for you.

559
00:38:22,692 --> 00:38:25,493
If you refuse to marry
Loras to Cersei,

560
00:38:25,528 --> 00:38:28,396
I will name him
to the Kingsguard.

561
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:31,865
<i>I'm sure you're familiar</i>
<i>with the Kingsguard vows.</i>

562
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:33,900
He will never marry.

563
00:38:33,935 --> 00:38:35,735
- He will never have children.
- Oh...

564
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:37,670
<i>The Tyrell name</i>
<i>will fade.</i>

565
00:38:37,705 --> 00:38:40,373
And Highgarden will go
to the children

566
00:38:40,407 --> 00:38:41,908
of Joffrey
and Margaery.

567
00:38:41,942 --> 00:38:44,411
You would have
your grandson protected

568
00:38:44,445 --> 00:38:46,280
by someone
who disgusts you?

569
00:38:46,314 --> 00:38:49,917
I would have my grandson
protected by a skilled warrior

570
00:38:49,951 --> 00:38:53,288
who takes his vows
seriously.

571
00:38:53,322 --> 00:38:56,157
So, shall I draw up
the order?

572
00:38:57,693 --> 00:39:00,095
Or do you consent
to this marriage?

573
00:39:04,766 --> 00:39:06,800
It's a rare enough thing--

574
00:39:06,868 --> 00:39:10,738
a man who lives up
to his reputation.

575
00:40:03,589 --> 00:40:04,923
No!

576
00:40:24,511 --> 00:40:26,312
We've gotta cut them loose!

577
00:40:26,346 --> 00:40:28,614
No!

578
00:41:14,095 --> 00:41:15,862
Take my hand!

579
00:41:51,734 --> 00:41:53,802
<i>That's a wonderful pin.</i>

580
00:41:53,836 --> 00:41:57,339
Oh, it's more
of a brooch, really.

581
00:42:00,610 --> 00:42:04,046
Though I suppose a brooch
is a sort of pin, so...

582
00:42:09,219 --> 00:42:12,754
I'm very happy about...

583
00:42:12,788 --> 00:42:14,589
Uh, yes.

584
00:42:14,624 --> 00:42:16,791
I-I am as well.

585
00:42:19,095 --> 00:42:21,129
I feel like
I'm in a dream.

586
00:42:21,164 --> 00:42:24,934
Yes, me, too.
Definitely.

587
00:42:24,968 --> 00:42:27,503
I've dreamed of a large wedding
since I was quite young.

588
00:42:27,538 --> 00:42:28,738
The guests,

589
00:42:28,772 --> 00:42:31,941
the food,
the tournaments.

590
00:42:35,013 --> 00:42:37,548
And the bride,
of course.

591
00:42:41,353 --> 00:42:43,988
The most beautiful bride
in the world

592
00:42:44,022 --> 00:42:45,622
in a beautiful
gown of gold

593
00:42:45,657 --> 00:42:48,225
and green brocade
with fringed sleeves.

594
00:42:50,662 --> 00:42:52,897
Have you ever been
to Highgarden, my lady?

595
00:42:54,032 --> 00:42:55,666
No. I had never
left Winterfell

596
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:58,703
before I came
to King's Landing.

597
00:42:58,737 --> 00:43:00,304
But it sounds wonderful.

598
00:43:00,339 --> 00:43:02,940
I can't wait to see it.

599
00:43:02,975 --> 00:43:05,076
And to leave this place.

600
00:43:06,178 --> 00:43:07,946
It's terrible,
isn't it?

601
00:43:10,449 --> 00:43:12,951
The most terrible
place there is.

602
00:43:22,462 --> 00:43:25,697
<i>I don't suppose</i>
<i>there's anything we can do about this.</i>

603
00:43:25,731 --> 00:43:27,999
We can have them
both killed.

604
00:43:29,802 --> 00:43:31,769
It's hard to say
which of the four of us

605
00:43:31,804 --> 00:43:34,806
is getting the worst
of this arrangement.

606
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:36,774
Probably Sansa.

607
00:43:36,809 --> 00:43:38,643
Though Loras
will certainly come to know

608
00:43:38,677 --> 00:43:41,446
a deep and singular misery.

609
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:44,216
Father doesn't
discriminate.

610
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:47,086
We're all being shipped
off to hell together.

611
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:49,221
On a boat you built.

612
00:43:49,256 --> 00:43:52,292
The Tyrells were plotting
to undermine our family.

613
00:43:52,326 --> 00:43:54,862
I did what I did
to protect our family.

614
00:43:54,896 --> 00:43:56,997
I'm your family.

615
00:43:57,932 --> 00:43:59,967
A member of your family

616
00:44:00,001 --> 00:44:03,037
who has actively contributed
to that family's survival.

617
00:44:04,105 --> 00:44:05,872
Whether or not
you or Father

618
00:44:05,907 --> 00:44:07,908
or anyone else
wants to admit it.

619
00:44:07,943 --> 00:44:10,244
I do admit it.

620
00:44:10,278 --> 00:44:12,913
If it weren't for your trick
with the wildfire,

621
00:44:12,948 --> 00:44:16,250
Stannis would have sacked the
city before Father got here.

622
00:44:16,284 --> 00:44:19,353
<i>Our heads would still be</i>
<i>rotting on the city gate.</i>

623
00:44:19,388 --> 00:44:23,724
Trying to have me killed is an
odd way of saying thank you.

624
00:44:25,861 --> 00:44:27,929
There are two people
in King's Landing

625
00:44:27,963 --> 00:44:30,130
who can give an order
to a Kingsguard.

626
00:44:30,165 --> 00:44:33,134
Did you or did you not
order Ser Mandon

627
00:44:33,168 --> 00:44:36,070
<i>to kill me during the Battle</i>
<i>of the Blackwater?</i>

628
00:44:45,646 --> 00:44:48,081
The impulse I understand.

629
00:44:49,284 --> 00:44:52,219
He hates me
because I'm the only one

630
00:44:52,253 --> 00:44:55,122
who tells him
what he really is.

631
00:44:57,992 --> 00:45:02,429
So, fair enough.
He wants me dead.

632
00:45:02,464 --> 00:45:04,465
But his stupidity?

633
00:45:04,499 --> 00:45:08,502
He could have had me poisoned
and no one would have known.

634
00:45:08,537 --> 00:45:12,005
But the king
orders a Kingsguard

635
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:14,208
to murder
the Hand of the King

636
00:45:14,242 --> 00:45:16,143
in full view
of his own army.

637
00:45:16,177 --> 00:45:17,711
The boy's an idiot.

638
00:45:17,746 --> 00:45:19,146
What do you
want me to say?

639
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:22,182
I want you to tell me if my life
is still in danger.

640
00:45:22,217 --> 00:45:23,951
Probably.

641
00:45:23,985 --> 00:45:25,686
But not from Joffrey.

642
00:45:25,721 --> 00:45:27,888
He won't do anything
now Father's here.

643
00:45:29,558 --> 00:45:32,160
Seven kingdoms
united in fear

644
00:45:32,194 --> 00:45:34,328
of Tywin Lannister.

645
00:45:34,363 --> 00:45:36,731
Not the Tyrells.

646
00:45:36,765 --> 00:45:38,800
Soon they won't need
to be afraid of him.

647
00:45:38,834 --> 00:45:40,268
Joffrey will belong
to Margaery,

648
00:45:40,302 --> 00:45:42,203
the little
doe-eyed whore.

649
00:45:42,237 --> 00:45:45,239
And so will his children
and their children.

650
00:45:45,274 --> 00:45:47,509
History will be taken
from our hands.

651
00:45:49,512 --> 00:45:52,080
You may escape,
at least.

652
00:45:52,114 --> 00:45:53,748
Once Jaime gets back,

653
00:45:53,783 --> 00:45:56,284
Ser Loras may come down
with a terrible case

654
00:45:56,319 --> 00:45:59,521
of sword through bowels.

655
00:45:59,555 --> 00:46:01,523
When Jaime gets back, yes.

656
00:46:01,557 --> 00:46:03,225
But when do we think
that's going to be?

657
00:46:03,259 --> 00:46:05,093
He's out there somewhere.

658
00:46:06,896 --> 00:46:10,766
Jaime or not,
I'm truly fucked.

659
00:46:13,837 --> 00:46:15,972
Who's going to tell her?

660
00:46:17,374 --> 00:46:19,708
Do you think
people will like it?

661
00:46:19,743 --> 00:46:22,244
I don't think they
will even notice it.

662
00:46:22,278 --> 00:46:24,747
You're right.
It's not my wedding.

663
00:46:26,249 --> 00:46:27,717
Anyway, from what
I can tell,

664
00:46:27,751 --> 00:46:29,919
the dressmakers in Highgarden
will be far superior

665
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:31,520
to the ones
in King's Landing.

666
00:46:31,555 --> 00:46:34,890
They'd never make me anything
as dull as this for my wedding.

667
00:46:36,093 --> 00:46:38,794
Loras likes green
and gold brocade.

668
00:46:38,829 --> 00:46:40,696
I'm sure he does.

669
00:46:42,165 --> 00:46:44,099
Will they let me
invite my family?

670
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:46,535
They haven't asked
my opinion.

671
00:46:46,569 --> 00:46:48,938
But do you think
they will?

672
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:50,573
No.

673
00:46:57,514 --> 00:46:59,214
Lady Sansa,
Lord Tyrion to see you.

674
00:46:59,249 --> 00:47:02,084
- Should I--
- I beg your pardon, my lady.

675
00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:04,487
Good afternoon,
Lord Tyrion.

676
00:47:04,522 --> 00:47:07,057
I was just trying on a gown
for King Joffrey's wedding.

677
00:47:08,526 --> 00:47:12,996
Yes, it should be
quite a wedding.

678
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:15,432
I need to speak
with you, Lady Sansa.

679
00:47:15,467 --> 00:47:16,967
Of course.

680
00:47:17,001 --> 00:47:19,670
Alone, if I may.

681
00:47:19,705 --> 00:47:21,405
Why do you need
to speak to her alone?

682
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:23,241
Shae.

683
00:47:23,275 --> 00:47:25,042
Please excuse her,
Lord Tyrion.

684
00:47:25,077 --> 00:47:26,578
<i>She's not from here.</i>

685
00:47:26,612 --> 00:47:27,812
But I trust her,

686
00:47:27,846 --> 00:47:30,115
even though
she tells me not to.

687
00:47:31,784 --> 00:47:35,621
Sometimes we think
we want to hear something

688
00:47:35,655 --> 00:47:38,724
<i>and it's only afterwards</i>
<i>when it's too late</i>

689
00:47:38,758 --> 00:47:41,526
that we realize
we wished we'd heard it

690
00:47:41,561 --> 00:47:43,695
under entirely
different circumstances.

691
00:47:43,730 --> 00:47:45,564
It's all right, really.

692
00:47:49,101 --> 00:47:51,336
How to begin?

693
00:47:53,906 --> 00:47:56,474
It's-- this--

694
00:47:56,509 --> 00:48:00,145
this-- this is awkward.

695
00:48:02,181 --> 00:48:04,215
1,000 blades

696
00:48:04,250 --> 00:48:07,318
taken from the hands
of Aegon's fallen enemies,

697
00:48:07,353 --> 00:48:10,755
forged in the fiery breath
of Balerion the Dread.

698
00:48:10,789 --> 00:48:13,525
There aren't
1,000 blades.

699
00:48:13,559 --> 00:48:16,127
There aren't even 200.

700
00:48:16,162 --> 00:48:17,663
I've counted.

701
00:48:17,697 --> 00:48:20,332
Ha, I'm sure you have.

702
00:48:20,366 --> 00:48:23,102
Ugly old thing.

703
00:48:23,136 --> 00:48:26,238
Yet it has
a certain appeal.

704
00:48:26,273 --> 00:48:28,708
The Lysa Arryn
of chairs.

705
00:48:28,742 --> 00:48:31,510
<i>Shame you had to settle</i>
<i>for your second choice.</i>

706
00:48:31,545 --> 00:48:33,813
Early days, my friend.

707
00:48:33,847 --> 00:48:36,782
It is flattering,
really...

708
00:48:38,085 --> 00:48:40,753
you feeling such dread

709
00:48:40,787 --> 00:48:43,255
at the prospect of me
getting what I want.

710
00:48:43,290 --> 00:48:46,092
Thwarting you has never
been my primary ambition,

711
00:48:46,126 --> 00:48:47,960
I promise you.

712
00:48:47,995 --> 00:48:51,397
Although who doesn't like to see
their friends fail now and then?

713
00:48:51,431 --> 00:48:52,698
You're so right.

714
00:48:52,733 --> 00:48:54,534
For instance,

715
00:48:54,568 --> 00:48:56,269
when I thwarted
your plan

716
00:48:56,303 --> 00:48:58,371
to give Sansa Stark
to the Tyrells.

717
00:48:58,405 --> 00:49:00,506
If I'm going
to be honest,

718
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:02,408
I did feel
an unmistakable sense

719
00:49:02,442 --> 00:49:05,911
of enjoyment there.

720
00:49:05,946 --> 00:49:08,547
But your confidant,

721
00:49:08,582 --> 00:49:12,051
the one who fed you information
about my plans,

722
00:49:12,085 --> 00:49:14,820
the one you swore
to protect...

723
00:49:16,156 --> 00:49:18,757
you didn't bring her
any enjoyment.

724
00:49:19,926 --> 00:49:23,395
And she didn't bring me
any enjoyment.

725
00:49:23,430 --> 00:49:26,632
She was a bad
investment on my part.

726
00:49:28,334 --> 00:49:31,470
Luckily, I have a friend

727
00:49:31,504 --> 00:49:33,872
who wanted to try
something new.

728
00:49:33,906 --> 00:49:37,409
Something daring.

729
00:49:37,444 --> 00:49:41,246
And he was so grateful
to me for providing

730
00:49:41,281 --> 00:49:44,549
this fresh experience.

731
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:51,422
I did what I did
for the good of the realm.

732
00:49:51,456 --> 00:49:54,091
The realm?

733
00:49:54,125 --> 00:49:56,526
Do you know
what the realm is?

734
00:49:58,296 --> 00:50:01,498
It's the thousand blades
of Aegon's enemies.

735
00:50:01,532 --> 00:50:06,470
A story we agree to tell
each other over and over

736
00:50:06,504 --> 00:50:08,972
till we forget
that it's a lie.

737
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:13,577
But what do we have left
once we abandon the lie?

738
00:50:13,611 --> 00:50:15,546
Chaos.

739
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:18,282
A gaping pit waiting
to swallow us all.

740
00:50:18,316 --> 00:50:21,852
Chaos isn't a pit.

741
00:50:21,887 --> 00:50:24,254
Chaos is a ladder.

742
00:50:26,424 --> 00:50:28,925
<i>Many who try</i>
<i>to climb it fail</i>

743
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:31,394
<i>and never get</i>
<i>to try again.</i>

744
00:50:32,496 --> 00:50:35,064
<i>The fall breaks them.</i>

745
00:50:43,507 --> 00:50:47,209
<i>And some are given</i>
<i>a chance to climb,</i>

746
00:50:47,244 --> 00:50:49,711
<i>but they refuse.</i>

747
00:50:49,746 --> 00:50:53,081
<i>They cling to the realm</i>

748
00:50:53,115 --> 00:50:55,116
<i>or the gods</i>

749
00:50:55,150 --> 00:50:57,585
<i>or love.</i>

750
00:50:57,619 --> 00:50:59,854
<i>Illusions.</i>

751
00:51:01,056 --> 00:51:03,824
<i>Only the ladder is real.</i>

752
00:51:03,859 --> 00:51:07,161
<i>The climb is all there is.</i>
