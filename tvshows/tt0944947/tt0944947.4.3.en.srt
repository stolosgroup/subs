4
00:01:57,696 --> 00:02:00,565
You did this.
You did this!

5
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:03,868
- We have to leave.
<i>- Take him! Take him!</i>

6
00:02:06,672 --> 00:02:08,606
Where is his wife?

7
00:02:08,641 --> 00:02:10,175
Where's Sansa?

8
00:02:10,209 --> 00:02:12,544
Find her.
Bar the gates of the city.

9
00:02:12,578 --> 00:02:16,047
<i>Seize every ship</i>
<i>in the harbor.</i>

10
00:02:16,081 --> 00:02:18,583
- Where is she?!
- No one leaves the capital!

11
00:02:18,617 --> 00:02:20,652
<i>No one!</i>

12
00:02:48,747 --> 00:02:51,182
- Get in.
- Where are we going?

13
00:02:51,217 --> 00:02:52,984
Somewhere safe.

14
00:03:37,863 --> 00:03:40,164
Up you go, my lady.

15
00:03:42,434 --> 00:03:44,435
You'll be fine.

16
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:46,337
You're stronger
than you know.

17
00:04:04,957 --> 00:04:07,058
- Lord Baelish?
- Petyr.

18
00:04:07,092 --> 00:04:09,160
Are you hurt,
my lady?

19
00:04:09,228 --> 00:04:10,929
Good. Good.

20
00:04:10,963 --> 00:04:13,798
I'm sure you've had quite a fright.
Rest easy.

21
00:04:13,832 --> 00:04:15,767
- The worst is past.
<i>- Lord Baelish.</i>

22
00:04:15,801 --> 00:04:17,075
<i>I promised I'd get</i>
<i>her to you safely.</i>

23
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,403
Softly, my friend.

24
00:04:18,404 --> 00:04:21,039
Voices carry
over water.

25
00:04:21,073 --> 00:04:24,108
I should get back before
someone thinks to look for me.

26
00:04:24,143 --> 00:04:26,144
First you'll want
your pay.

27
00:04:26,178 --> 00:04:28,980
- 10,000 was it?
- 10,000.

28
00:04:34,787 --> 00:04:36,921
Wait!

29
00:04:38,324 --> 00:04:40,325
<i>Shh.</i>

30
00:04:40,359 --> 00:04:42,226
You don't want
the queen to hear, do you?

31
00:04:42,261 --> 00:04:44,896
1,000 gold cloaks
are searching for you.

32
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:46,798
And if they found you,

33
00:04:46,832 --> 00:04:50,501
how do you think they would punish
the girl who murdered the king?

34
00:04:50,536 --> 00:04:53,871
- I didn't murder anyone.
- I know. I know.

35
00:04:53,906 --> 00:04:55,139
But you must admit
it looks suspicious.

36
00:04:55,174 --> 00:04:57,241
The king who
executed your father,

37
00:04:57,276 --> 00:04:59,510
who tormented you
for years,

38
00:04:59,545 --> 00:05:02,280
and you fled the scene
of his murder.

39
00:05:02,314 --> 00:05:04,482
Why did you kill him?

40
00:05:04,516 --> 00:05:07,251
Because he was
a drunk and a fool

41
00:05:07,286 --> 00:05:10,121
and I don't trust
drunk fools.

42
00:05:10,155 --> 00:05:12,390
He saved me.

43
00:05:12,424 --> 00:05:15,393
Saved you? My lady,
he followed my orders.

44
00:05:15,427 --> 00:05:19,797
Every one of them.
And he did it all for gold.

45
00:05:19,832 --> 00:05:22,500
<i>Money buys a man's</i>
<i>silence for a time.</i>

46
00:05:22,534 --> 00:05:25,870
A bolt in the heart
buys it forever.

47
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,042
He was helping me
because I saved his life.

48
00:05:31,076 --> 00:05:35,179
Yes, and he gave you
a priceless necklace

49
00:05:35,214 --> 00:05:38,282
that once belonged
to his grandmother.

50
00:05:38,317 --> 00:05:41,386
The last legacy
of House Hollard.

51
00:05:49,495 --> 00:05:52,196
I had it made
a few weeks ago.

52
00:05:53,465 --> 00:05:56,434
What did I once tell
you about the capital?

53
00:05:56,468 --> 00:05:59,137
We're all liars here.

54
00:06:00,973 --> 00:06:02,874
Come, my lady.

55
00:06:02,908 --> 00:06:05,543
I know you've had
a difficult day.

56
00:06:05,577 --> 00:06:07,679
But you're safe now.

57
00:06:07,713 --> 00:06:09,847
I promise you that.

58
00:06:09,882 --> 00:06:12,050
You're safe with me

59
00:06:12,084 --> 00:06:14,686
and sailing home.

60
00:06:20,826 --> 00:06:23,428
So am I the queen?

61
00:06:23,462 --> 00:06:25,229
More than you were
with Renly.

62
00:06:25,264 --> 00:06:28,332
Less than you would have been if
Joffrey had done you the courtesy

63
00:06:28,367 --> 00:06:31,302
of consummating
the marriage before dying.

64
00:06:31,336 --> 00:06:34,572
In any case, this would
not be an opportune moment

65
00:06:34,606 --> 00:06:36,474
to press the issue.

66
00:06:36,508 --> 00:06:38,342
Clawing at his own throat,

67
00:06:38,377 --> 00:06:41,245
looking to his mother to make it stop--
it was horrible.

68
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,781
The world is overflowing
with horrible things.

69
00:06:43,816 --> 00:06:46,084
But they're all a tray
of cakes next to death.

70
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,822
They brought me your grandfather's
body when he died, you know?

71
00:06:50,856 --> 00:06:52,657
Made me look at it.

72
00:06:52,691 --> 00:06:54,225
What was it like?

73
00:06:54,259 --> 00:06:57,428
They took me to the Great
Hall and there he was.

74
00:06:57,463 --> 00:06:59,297
The man I'd married

75
00:06:59,331 --> 00:07:02,567
and suffered to father
my children.

76
00:07:02,601 --> 00:07:04,836
A great doughy lump
I'd sat next to

77
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:08,272
at endless dinners
and tedious gatherings.

78
00:07:08,307 --> 00:07:10,875
There he was...

79
00:07:11,877 --> 00:07:14,312
lying on a table.

80
00:07:17,549 --> 00:07:19,717
One of my husbands
preferred the company of men

81
00:07:19,752 --> 00:07:21,419
and was stabbed
through the heart.

82
00:07:21,453 --> 00:07:23,821
Another was happiest
torturing animals

83
00:07:23,856 --> 00:07:26,090
and was poisoned
at our wedding feast.

84
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:28,092
- I must be cursed.
- Nonsense.

85
00:07:28,127 --> 00:07:31,028
Your circumstances
have improved markedly.

86
00:07:32,765 --> 00:07:35,666
You may not have enjoyed
watching him die,

87
00:07:35,701 --> 00:07:37,535
but you enjoyed it more
than you would have enjoyed

88
00:07:37,569 --> 00:07:39,537
being married to him,
I can promise you that.

89
00:07:39,571 --> 00:07:41,672
But I would have been
the queen.

90
00:07:41,707 --> 00:07:43,574
Our alliance
with the Lannisters

91
00:07:43,609 --> 00:07:46,210
remains every bit
as necessary to them

92
00:07:46,245 --> 00:07:48,713
as it is unpleasant
for us.

93
00:07:48,747 --> 00:07:51,716
You did wonderful
work on Joffrey.

94
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:54,819
The next one
should be easier.

95
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:06,430
<i>Your brother is dead.</i>

96
00:08:07,933 --> 00:08:10,835
Do you know
what that means?

97
00:08:13,071 --> 00:08:16,440
I'm not trying
to trick you.

98
00:08:17,643 --> 00:08:19,610
It means I'll become king.

99
00:08:19,645 --> 00:08:22,046
Yes, you will
become king.

100
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,349
What kind of king
do you think you'll be?

101
00:08:26,418 --> 00:08:28,119
A good king?

102
00:08:28,153 --> 00:08:30,488
Mm, I think so as well.

103
00:08:32,057 --> 00:08:35,059
You've got the right
temperament for it.

104
00:08:35,093 --> 00:08:38,863
<i>But what makes</i>
<i>a good king? Hmm?</i>

105
00:08:38,897 --> 00:08:42,300
What is a good king's
single most important quality?

106
00:08:42,334 --> 00:08:44,502
This is hardly
the place or the time.

107
00:08:44,536 --> 00:08:46,470
Holiness?

108
00:08:46,505 --> 00:08:48,673
Hmm.

109
00:08:48,707 --> 00:08:52,009
<i>Baelor the Blessed</i>
<i>was holy.</i>

110
00:08:52,044 --> 00:08:54,245
And pious.

111
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:56,881
He built this sept.

112
00:08:56,915 --> 00:09:00,218
He also named
a six-year-old boy high septon

113
00:09:00,252 --> 00:09:03,554
because he thought the boy
could work miracles.

114
00:09:04,923 --> 00:09:07,625
He ended up fasting
himself into an early grave

115
00:09:07,659 --> 00:09:09,760
because food
was of this world

116
00:09:09,795 --> 00:09:12,029
and this world
was sinful.

117
00:09:14,433 --> 00:09:15,967
Justice.

118
00:09:16,001 --> 00:09:17,735
Yeah.

119
00:09:17,769 --> 00:09:20,071
A good king
must be just.

120
00:09:21,006 --> 00:09:22,940
Orys I was just.

121
00:09:22,975 --> 00:09:26,444
Everyone applauded
his reforms.

122
00:09:26,478 --> 00:09:28,479
Nobles and commoners alike.

123
00:09:28,513 --> 00:09:30,648
But he wasn't just for long.

124
00:09:30,682 --> 00:09:32,717
He was murdered
in his sleep

125
00:09:32,751 --> 00:09:34,986
after less than a year
by his own brother.

126
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:38,256
Was that truly
just of him?

127
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:40,524
To abandon his subjects
to an evil

128
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:42,727
that he was too gullible
to recognize?

129
00:09:42,761 --> 00:09:45,096
- No.
- No.

130
00:09:47,466 --> 00:09:50,334
- What about strength?
- Yes.

131
00:09:50,369 --> 00:09:52,703
Strength.

132
00:09:52,738 --> 00:09:54,906
King Robert was strong.

133
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:57,441
He won the rebellion

134
00:09:57,476 --> 00:10:01,078
and crushed
the Targaryen dynasty.

135
00:10:01,113 --> 00:10:03,981
And he attended three
small council meetings

136
00:10:04,016 --> 00:10:05,850
in 17 years.

137
00:10:05,884 --> 00:10:10,388
<i>He spent his time</i>
<i>whoring and hunting and drinking</i>

138
00:10:10,422 --> 00:10:12,924
until the last two
killed him.

139
00:10:14,326 --> 00:10:17,395
<i>So, we have a man</i>
<i>who starves himself to death,</i>

140
00:10:17,429 --> 00:10:20,932
a man who lets his own
brother murder him,

141
00:10:20,966 --> 00:10:24,602
and a man who thinks that winning
and ruling are the same thing.

142
00:10:27,072 --> 00:10:29,640
What do they all lack?

143
00:10:34,112 --> 00:10:35,947
- Wisdom.
- Yes!

144
00:10:35,981 --> 00:10:38,015
Wisdom is what
makes a good king.

145
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:39,650
Yes.

146
00:10:39,685 --> 00:10:42,386
But what is wisdom?
Hmm?

147
00:10:44,589 --> 00:10:47,258
<i>A house with great wealth</i>
<i>and fertile lands</i>

148
00:10:47,292 --> 00:10:49,060
<i>asks you</i>
<i>for your protection</i>

149
00:10:49,094 --> 00:10:52,063
against another house
with a strong navy

150
00:10:52,097 --> 00:10:54,498
that could one day
oppose you.

151
00:10:54,533 --> 00:10:58,002
How do you know which choice
is wise and which isn't?

152
00:10:58,036 --> 00:11:01,973
You've any experience
of treasuries and granaries

153
00:11:02,007 --> 00:11:04,075
<i>or shipyards and soldiers?</i>

154
00:11:04,109 --> 00:11:07,144
- No.
- <i>No. Of course not.</i>

155
00:11:07,179 --> 00:11:10,648
A wise king knows what he
knows and what he doesn't.

156
00:11:10,682 --> 00:11:12,383
You're young.

157
00:11:12,417 --> 00:11:15,886
<i>A wise young king listens</i>
<i>to his counselors</i>

158
00:11:15,921 --> 00:11:19,557
and heeds their advice
until he comes of age.

159
00:11:19,591 --> 00:11:21,459
And the wisest kings

160
00:11:21,493 --> 00:11:25,396
continue to listen to them
long afterwards.

161
00:11:26,698 --> 00:11:28,099
Your brother was not
a wise king.

162
00:11:28,133 --> 00:11:30,634
<i>Your brother was not</i>
<i>a good king.</i>

163
00:11:30,669 --> 00:11:32,536
<i>If he had been,</i>

164
00:11:32,571 --> 00:11:35,406
perhaps he'd still
be alive.

165
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,576
Now, as the king,
you will have to marry.

166
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:40,845
Do you understand why?

167
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:42,613
<i>A king needs a queen.</i>

168
00:11:42,647 --> 00:11:44,482
<i>Yes, but why?</i>

169
00:11:44,516 --> 00:11:48,185
To further
the family line.

170
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:51,489
- <i>Do you know how that happens?</i>
- Yes.

171
00:11:51,523 --> 00:11:55,359
Yes, but has anyone
explained the details to you?

172
00:11:55,394 --> 00:11:56,961
I don't think so.

173
00:11:56,995 --> 00:12:00,364
It's all relatively
straightforward.

174
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,700
- How are you?
- I'm all right.

175
00:12:02,734 --> 00:12:04,935
You are.
You will be.

176
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:07,204
I'll see to that.

177
00:12:12,444 --> 00:12:14,478
Please give the queen
a moment alone with her son.

178
00:12:14,513 --> 00:12:16,514
- Yes, my lord.
- All of you.

179
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:47,945
It was Tyrion.

180
00:12:47,979 --> 00:12:50,981
He killed him.

181
00:12:52,684 --> 00:12:54,919
He told me he would.

182
00:12:56,421 --> 00:13:00,091
"A day will come when you
think you are safe and happy

183
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:03,794
and your joy will turn
to ashes in your mouth."

184
00:13:06,264 --> 00:13:08,899
That's what he said
to me.

185
00:13:12,104 --> 00:13:14,939
You saw it.

186
00:13:14,973 --> 00:13:17,641
You saw Joff point at him
just before he--

187
00:13:17,676 --> 00:13:19,677
I don't know
what I saw.

188
00:13:22,247 --> 00:13:24,648
Avenge him.

189
00:13:24,683 --> 00:13:27,184
Avenge our son.

190
00:13:28,587 --> 00:13:30,121
Kill Tyrion.

191
00:13:33,091 --> 00:13:34,925
Tyrion's my brother.

192
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,827
<i>Our brother.</i>

193
00:13:36,862 --> 00:13:39,330
There'll be a trial. We'll get
to the truth of what happened.

194
00:13:39,364 --> 00:13:41,832
I don't want a trial.

195
00:13:41,867 --> 00:13:45,336
He'll squirm his way to freedom
given the chance.

196
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:47,104
I want him dead.

197
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:52,009
Please, Jaime.

198
00:13:52,043 --> 00:13:54,378
You have to.

199
00:13:55,747 --> 00:13:57,982
He was our son.

200
00:13:58,016 --> 00:14:00,351
Our baby boy.

201
00:14:39,824 --> 00:14:41,892
You're a hateful woman.

202
00:14:41,927 --> 00:14:45,196
Why have the gods made
me love a hateful woman?

203
00:14:53,438 --> 00:14:55,573
Jaime, not here,
please.

204
00:14:55,607 --> 00:14:57,107
Please.

205
00:14:57,142 --> 00:14:59,143
Stop it.

206
00:14:59,177 --> 00:15:02,279
- Stop it. Stop.
- No.

207
00:15:02,314 --> 00:15:04,782
Stop it.
Stop.

208
00:15:09,321 --> 00:15:11,388
Stop.

209
00:15:18,463 --> 00:15:21,599
Stop. It's not right.

210
00:15:21,633 --> 00:15:24,468
It's not right.
It's not right.

211
00:15:24,502 --> 00:15:26,403
I don't care.

212
00:15:26,438 --> 00:15:28,505
- Don't.
- I don't care.

213
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:30,808
- Don't. Jaime, don't.
- I don't care.

214
00:15:33,144 --> 00:15:35,045
Gonna rain soon.

215
00:15:37,349 --> 00:15:39,450
Where are we?

216
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:44,488
Near Fairmarket,
I think.

217
00:15:44,522 --> 00:15:45,990
You think?

218
00:15:46,024 --> 00:15:47,391
You don't have a map?

219
00:15:47,425 --> 00:15:50,628
- <i>No, I don't have a map.</i>
- Maybe we should get one.

220
00:15:50,662 --> 00:15:53,764
Just point out the next map shop
you see and I'll buy you one.

221
00:15:53,798 --> 00:15:55,666
How far is it
to the Eyrie?

222
00:15:55,734 --> 00:15:56,554
Far.

223
00:15:56,579 --> 00:15:58,532
And you're sure we're
going the right way?

224
00:15:58,603 --> 00:16:01,839
Believe me, girl, I want you there
as soon as I can.

225
00:16:01,873 --> 00:16:04,675
Get my gold,
be on my way.

226
00:16:04,709 --> 00:16:07,678
- On your way where?
- Why do you care?

227
00:16:13,818 --> 00:16:17,288
Might book passage
across the Narrow Sea.

228
00:16:17,322 --> 00:16:19,556
<i>Fight as a sellsword.</i>

229
00:16:19,591 --> 00:16:24,228
Second Sons, could be.
Seems like a good fit for me.

230
00:16:24,262 --> 00:16:25,796
I'd like to see
Braavos one day.

231
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:28,132
Why Braavos?

232
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:29,800
I have friends there.

233
00:16:29,834 --> 00:16:32,002
I doubt it.

234
00:16:32,037 --> 00:16:34,347
Seven blessings
to you.

235
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:37,749
What do you want?

236
00:16:37,774 --> 00:16:39,956
What do I want?
This is my land.

237
00:16:40,378 --> 00:16:42,146
If I'm standing on it,
it's my land.

238
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:45,783
We were just watering the horses.
We'll be on our way.

239
00:16:50,055 --> 00:16:51,422
Forgive my father.

240
00:16:51,456 --> 00:16:53,991
<i>He was wounded fighting</i>
<i>in the war.</i>

241
00:16:54,025 --> 00:16:57,361
Our cottage burned down while
he was gone and my mother with it.

242
00:17:00,765 --> 00:17:02,700
He's never been the same.

243
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,140
Which house did he
fight for?

244
00:17:14,245 --> 00:17:16,814
The Tullys of Riverrun.

245
00:17:20,418 --> 00:17:22,386
There's a storm coming.

246
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:23,921
<i>You'll be wanting</i>
<i>a roof tonight.</i>

247
00:17:23,955 --> 00:17:26,156
<i>There's fresh hay</i>
<i>in the barn.</i>

248
00:17:26,191 --> 00:17:29,360
And Sally here makes rabbit stew
just like her mom used to do.

249
00:17:31,763 --> 00:17:33,630
We don't have much,
but any man that bled

250
00:17:33,665 --> 00:17:35,833
for House Tully
is welcome to it.

251
00:17:41,172 --> 00:17:43,640
<i>We ask the Father</i>
<i>to judge us with mercy</i>

252
00:17:43,675 --> 00:17:45,642
<i>accepting our</i>
<i>human frailty.</i>

253
00:17:45,677 --> 00:17:47,611
<i>We ask the Mother</i>
<i>to bless our crops</i>

254
00:17:47,645 --> 00:17:50,714
so we may feed ourselves
and all who come to our door.

255
00:17:50,749 --> 00:17:52,950
<i>We ask the Warrior</i>
<i>to give us courage</i>

256
00:17:52,984 --> 00:17:55,152
in these days of strife
and turmoil.

257
00:17:55,186 --> 00:17:57,454
We ask the Maiden
to protect Sally's virtue

258
00:17:57,489 --> 00:17:59,169
to keep her from
the clutches of depravity.

259
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:01,058
You got to do
all seven of the fuckers?

260
00:18:01,092 --> 00:18:03,427
Father!

261
00:18:06,765 --> 00:18:08,966
We ask the Smith
to strengthen our hands

262
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,069
and our backs so we may finish
the work required of us.

263
00:18:12,103 --> 00:18:16,306
We ask the Crone to guide us on our
journey from darkness to darkness.

264
00:18:16,341 --> 00:18:18,575
And we ask the Stranger
not to kill us

265
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:21,111
in our beds tonight
for no damn reason at all.

266
00:18:26,618 --> 00:18:28,886
I'm so sorry.

267
00:18:47,939 --> 00:18:49,873
Really good.

268
00:18:49,908 --> 00:18:52,042
- Did you fight at the Twins?
- Call that a fight?

269
00:18:52,076 --> 00:18:54,478
Slaughtering livestock
more like.

270
00:18:54,512 --> 00:18:56,713
The Red Wedding
they're calling it.

271
00:18:56,748 --> 00:18:59,583
Walder Frey committed
sacrilege that day.

272
00:18:59,617 --> 00:19:03,120
He shared bread and salt with the Starks.
He offered them guest right.

273
00:19:03,154 --> 00:19:05,322
Guest right
don't mean much anymore.

274
00:19:05,356 --> 00:19:07,991
It means something
to me.

275
00:19:08,026 --> 00:19:10,527
The gods will have
their vengeance.

276
00:19:10,562 --> 00:19:13,597
Frey will burn in the seventh hell
for what he did.

277
00:19:13,631 --> 00:19:16,934
Things were different when Hoster
Tully ruled the Riverlands.

278
00:19:16,968 --> 00:19:19,736
We had good years
and bad years, same as anyone.

279
00:19:19,771 --> 00:19:22,606
But we were safe.
Now with the Freys,

280
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,710
raiders come plundering,
steal our food, steal our silver.

281
00:19:26,744 --> 00:19:28,745
I was gonna send Sally north
to stay with my brother,

282
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:31,949
but the north's no better.
The whole country's gone sour.

283
00:19:32,016 --> 00:19:33,851
You got any ale?

284
00:19:34,819 --> 00:19:36,987
Afraid not.

285
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:42,626
How can a man
not keep ale in his home?

286
00:19:44,362 --> 00:19:47,364
You look like you could
really swing that sword.

287
00:19:47,398 --> 00:19:49,933
<i>A real warrior</i>
<i>with proper training.</i>

288
00:19:51,236 --> 00:19:53,837
Those raiders wouldn't
stand a chance against you.

289
00:19:53,872 --> 00:19:56,507
<i>How would it be if you stayed</i>
<i>on till the new moon?</i>

290
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:59,276
I could use a man to help
with the farmwork.

291
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:01,812
Sally does what she can,

292
00:20:01,846 --> 00:20:03,981
but she can't lift
a bale of hay.

293
00:20:04,015 --> 00:20:06,149
And if any thieves came
looking for easy pickings,

294
00:20:06,184 --> 00:20:09,353
one look at you, I'd bet
they'd run the other way.

295
00:20:10,855 --> 00:20:12,689
Meaning no offense.

296
00:20:18,997 --> 00:20:20,831
What'll you pay?

297
00:20:20,865 --> 00:20:22,866
I don't have much.

298
00:20:22,901 --> 00:20:26,537
But I have hidden
a bit of silver from the bandits.

299
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:31,542
Fair wages
for fair work?

300
00:20:37,148 --> 00:20:39,082
Fair wages
for fair work.

301
00:21:10,982 --> 00:21:13,884
- What did you do?!
- <i>Get your horse saddled.</i>

302
00:21:13,918 --> 00:21:16,954
- You told me you weren't a thief.
- I wasn't.

303
00:21:16,988 --> 00:21:19,723
He took us in.
He fed us and you--

304
00:21:19,757 --> 00:21:21,525
Aye, he took us in.
He's a good man

305
00:21:21,559 --> 00:21:23,160
and his daughter makes
a nice stew.

306
00:21:23,194 --> 00:21:24,928
And they'll both
be dead come winter.

307
00:21:24,963 --> 00:21:27,531
- You don't know that.
- I do know it.

308
00:21:27,565 --> 00:21:30,233
He's weak.
He can't protect himself.

309
00:21:30,268 --> 00:21:32,869
They'll both be dead
come winter.

310
00:21:32,904 --> 00:21:34,738
Dead men don't need silver.

311
00:21:34,772 --> 00:21:38,842
You're the worst shit
in the Seven Kingdoms.

312
00:21:39,944 --> 00:21:42,079
There's plenty
worse than me.

313
00:21:42,113 --> 00:21:44,448
I just understand
the way things are.

314
00:21:44,482 --> 00:21:48,118
How many Starks they got to behead
before you figure it out?

315
00:21:52,323 --> 00:21:54,925
Raper. Raper.

316
00:21:54,959 --> 00:21:56,727
Horse thief.

317
00:21:56,761 --> 00:21:59,029
Ninth born son.

318
00:21:59,097 --> 00:22:00,998
Raper.

319
00:22:01,032 --> 00:22:03,300
Thief.
Thief and raper.

320
00:22:03,334 --> 00:22:07,004
There he is,
Sam the Slayer.

321
00:22:07,038 --> 00:22:08,739
Going to visit
your wildling whore?

322
00:22:08,773 --> 00:22:10,941
- She's not a whore.
- No?

323
00:22:11,009 --> 00:22:13,443
Maybe I'll give her
a copper tonight and find out.

324
00:22:18,883 --> 00:22:20,550
They all think
I'm lying.

325
00:22:20,585 --> 00:22:22,252
About what?

326
00:22:22,286 --> 00:22:24,554
Killing the white walker.

327
00:22:24,589 --> 00:22:27,491
You're not lying.

328
00:22:27,525 --> 00:22:29,593
I'll never forget
the way it screamed.

329
00:22:31,295 --> 00:22:33,497
But you're the only one
that saw it.

330
00:22:33,531 --> 00:22:35,198
And they all think
you're just a--

331
00:22:35,233 --> 00:22:36,466
A what?

332
00:22:36,501 --> 00:22:39,536
Well, a wildling.

333
00:22:40,505 --> 00:22:42,472
My father hated that word.

334
00:22:42,507 --> 00:22:45,876
It's not a very nice word,
I suppose.

335
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:47,711
I don't know.

336
00:22:47,745 --> 00:22:51,815
It makes me sound
a bit dangerous, doesn't it?

337
00:23:03,661 --> 00:23:05,295
So...

338
00:23:05,329 --> 00:23:07,030
are you all right?

339
00:23:07,065 --> 00:23:09,633
No one bothering you?

340
00:23:09,667 --> 00:23:11,268
I get a lot of looks.

341
00:23:11,302 --> 00:23:13,403
I hear them making
their jokes.

342
00:23:13,438 --> 00:23:16,406
But no one's touched me
if that's what you mean.

343
00:23:16,441 --> 00:23:19,643
I worry about
it sometimes.

344
00:23:19,677 --> 00:23:21,945
All the time.

345
00:23:21,979 --> 00:23:24,981
Why do you worry
about it?

346
00:23:25,016 --> 00:23:28,051
100 men, one woman.

347
00:23:28,086 --> 00:23:30,420
They've got other things
to think about.

348
00:23:30,455 --> 00:23:32,989
That's the only thing
they think about.

349
00:23:33,024 --> 00:23:35,559
- You're being silly.
- I'm not being silly.

350
00:23:35,593 --> 00:23:39,696
There's 100 men lying awake
at night picturing you.

351
00:23:41,632 --> 00:23:43,700
What about you?

352
00:23:45,403 --> 00:23:47,003
What about me?

353
00:23:49,807 --> 00:23:52,109
Gilly?

354
00:23:56,881 --> 00:23:58,882
I worry about you.

355
00:24:03,588 --> 00:24:05,622
Thank you.

356
00:24:05,656 --> 00:24:06,890
For what?

357
00:24:06,924 --> 00:24:09,292
For worrying
about me.

358
00:24:12,964 --> 00:24:16,266
I don't know
if you're safe here.

359
00:24:17,135 --> 00:24:18,435
They're my brothers,

360
00:24:18,469 --> 00:24:20,871
but some of them were thieves
before they came here.

361
00:24:20,905 --> 00:24:22,506
Some of them were rapers.

362
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:25,342
You saw what they did
at your father's keep.

363
00:24:25,376 --> 00:24:28,779
So what are you saying?

364
00:24:31,349 --> 00:24:36,219
Maybe you'd be safer
in Mole's Town.

365
00:24:40,758 --> 00:24:43,093
Are you bored of me?

366
00:24:43,127 --> 00:24:45,896
Bored of you?

367
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:48,365
I...

368
00:24:52,003 --> 00:24:53,837
I want to protect you.

369
00:25:00,278 --> 00:25:02,179
I'll get these to Hobb.

370
00:25:02,213 --> 00:25:04,581
Keep an eye
on little Sam.

371
00:25:34,178 --> 00:25:36,179
Your Grace.

372
00:25:36,214 --> 00:25:39,349
You're a literary man now.
What do you make of that?

373
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:53,096
- Joffrey?
- The usurper Joffrey Baratheon.

374
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:56,466
<i>I said those words when I </i>
<i>tossed a leech into the fire.</i>

375
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:59,269
A leech filled with
bastard blood.

376
00:25:59,303 --> 00:26:01,671
A bastard you set free.

377
00:26:01,706 --> 00:26:04,307
I am now faced with
a great opportunity

378
00:26:04,342 --> 00:26:06,142
and I am powerless
to take advantage of it.

379
00:26:06,177 --> 00:26:07,944
I will find you
an army, Your Grace.

380
00:26:07,979 --> 00:26:10,480
- I've been working day and night--
- What progress have you made?

381
00:26:10,514 --> 00:26:12,515
I've rallied House Peasebury
to your cause.

382
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:14,217
House Peasebury.

383
00:26:14,252 --> 00:26:17,520
- House Musgood.
- House Musgood.

384
00:26:17,555 --> 00:26:19,890
- And House Haigh.
- House Haigh.

385
00:26:24,962 --> 00:26:27,898
They don't have enough men
between them to raid a pantry.

386
00:26:29,367 --> 00:26:31,468
Westeros is not
the world, Your Grace.

387
00:26:31,502 --> 00:26:33,270
We need to look east
for ships and men.

388
00:26:33,304 --> 00:26:36,606
10,000 skilled soldiers
fight for the Golden Company.

389
00:26:36,641 --> 00:26:38,642
- The Golden Company?
- They've never broken a contract.

390
00:26:38,676 --> 00:26:40,076
They're sellswords.

391
00:26:40,111 --> 00:26:41,811
We're willing to use blood magic
to put you on the throne,

392
00:26:41,846 --> 00:26:43,613
but we're not willing
to pay men to fight?

393
00:26:43,648 --> 00:26:46,049
Now the Red Woman's
magic is real.

394
00:26:46,083 --> 00:26:48,285
Her visions and prophecies
may be, too,

395
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:51,154
but I've never heard of visions
and prophecies winning a war.

396
00:26:51,188 --> 00:26:53,523
Soldiers win wars.
Soldiers on the ground.

397
00:26:53,557 --> 00:26:54,858
It's dirty on the ground.

398
00:26:54,892 --> 00:26:56,760
We don't have any gold.

399
00:26:56,794 --> 00:26:57,994
Not yet.

400
00:27:02,199 --> 00:27:04,067
If I do not
press my claim,

401
00:27:04,101 --> 00:27:06,169
my claim
will be forgotten.

402
00:27:06,203 --> 00:27:09,739
I will not become a page
in someone else's history book.

403
00:27:09,774 --> 00:27:12,976
I'm running out
of time, Ser Davos.

404
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:16,146
Which means you're
running out of time.

405
00:27:21,152 --> 00:27:22,752
You're late.

406
00:27:22,787 --> 00:27:24,321
I'm sorry, Princess.

407
00:27:24,355 --> 00:27:26,122
I thought you
weren't coming.

408
00:27:26,157 --> 00:27:28,792
The Hand of the King
doesn't have much leisure time.

409
00:27:28,826 --> 00:27:30,550
You won't be a very good
Hand if you see the word

410
00:27:30,575 --> 00:27:32,495
knight and say "ka-nigit."

411
00:27:32,496 --> 00:27:33,930
That happened once,
weeks ago.

412
00:27:33,965 --> 00:27:35,999
You're your father's
daughter, no mistake.

413
00:27:36,033 --> 00:27:38,001
Bloody relentless,
the both of you.

414
00:27:38,035 --> 00:27:40,637
It's a new one today.
Lots of tricky words.

415
00:27:40,671 --> 00:27:42,872
But I think you can manage.

416
00:27:45,009 --> 00:27:47,143
You'll never read well
if you move your lips.

417
00:27:47,178 --> 00:27:49,379
That's how children do it.

418
00:27:54,185 --> 00:27:58,555
"The Life and Adventures
of Elyo Grivas

419
00:27:58,589 --> 00:28:00,924
First Sword of Braavos."

420
00:28:00,958 --> 00:28:02,926
Thank you very much.

421
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,262
I like this one. It's full
of sword fights and pirates.

422
00:28:06,297 --> 00:28:07,998
You were a pirate once.

423
00:28:08,032 --> 00:28:09,899
No, I was never a pirate.
I was a smuggler.

424
00:28:09,934 --> 00:28:11,134
What's the difference?

425
00:28:11,168 --> 00:28:13,136
Well, if you're
a famous smuggler,

426
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:14,804
you're not doing it right.

427
00:28:14,839 --> 00:28:16,606
My father says
a criminal is a criminal.

428
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,341
Your father lacks
an appreciation

429
00:28:18,376 --> 00:28:20,610
of the finer points
of bad behavior.

430
00:28:20,644 --> 00:28:22,812
So do the Braavosi.

431
00:28:22,847 --> 00:28:24,514
- You've sailed to Braavos?
- Of course.

432
00:28:24,548 --> 00:28:27,350
Almost got beheaded
by a First Sword of Braavos.

433
00:28:27,385 --> 00:28:28,899
I tried to explain to him

434
00:28:28,924 --> 00:28:31,404
the difference between
pirates and smugglers,

435
00:28:31,722 --> 00:28:35,525
but he didn't seem any more interested
in the distinction than your father.

436
00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:37,260
I suppose if you work
for the Iron Bank of Braavos

437
00:28:37,294 --> 00:28:39,763
and each one of your gold barges
is worth half a kingdom,

438
00:28:39,797 --> 00:28:43,767
you tend not to be overly
concerned with the kind of distinction--

439
00:29:02,119 --> 00:29:04,587
- What was that for?
- I need you to write a message.

440
00:29:04,622 --> 00:29:06,756
You should write it yourself.
It's good practice.

441
00:29:06,791 --> 00:29:08,324
It's too important for me.

442
00:29:08,359 --> 00:29:11,561
I need a smart person
to do it. Go on.

443
00:29:11,595 --> 00:29:15,665
To the offices
of the Iron Bank of Braavos

444
00:29:15,699 --> 00:29:19,436
from Stannis Baratheon
the one true king of Westeros.

445
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:20,970
But that's not you.

446
00:29:21,005 --> 00:29:22,739
I need to get
their attention.

447
00:29:22,773 --> 00:29:25,475
Go on. Write.

448
00:29:35,319 --> 00:29:37,754
He's seen some
adventures, hasn't he?

449
00:29:57,374 --> 00:30:00,443
- Precious little thing.
- Thank you.

450
00:30:00,478 --> 00:30:03,313
- What's his name?
- Sam.

451
00:30:03,347 --> 00:30:05,014
Lovely.

452
00:30:05,049 --> 00:30:06,850
That the daddy?

453
00:30:06,884 --> 00:30:08,017
No.

454
00:30:08,052 --> 00:30:09,586
Where's the daddy?

455
00:30:10,454 --> 00:30:12,122
He's dead.

456
00:30:12,156 --> 00:30:15,091
Oh. Where you from?

457
00:30:17,228 --> 00:30:18,761
North of here.

458
00:30:18,796 --> 00:30:21,030
North of here?

459
00:30:24,468 --> 00:30:27,070
You a fucking wildling?

460
00:30:27,104 --> 00:30:29,939
- Only room and board?
- That's right.

461
00:30:29,974 --> 00:30:32,642
She'll clean and cook

462
00:30:32,676 --> 00:30:34,196
and look after the other
girls' babies.

463
00:30:34,211 --> 00:30:37,046
Could find other
work for her, too.

464
00:30:37,081 --> 00:30:39,649
- No other work.
- There'd be money.

465
00:30:39,683 --> 00:30:41,317
Give you a piece of it.

466
00:30:41,352 --> 00:30:43,820
No other work.

467
00:31:05,276 --> 00:31:08,144
I promise to come back
and visit whenever I can.

468
00:31:11,515 --> 00:31:13,683
You'll be safer here.

469
00:31:13,717 --> 00:31:15,852
Who's gonna protect you
at Castle Black? Me?

470
00:31:16,954 --> 00:31:18,988
You protected me
north of the Wall.

471
00:31:19,023 --> 00:31:20,890
This is different.

472
00:31:20,925 --> 00:31:22,365
They're brothers
of the Night's Watch

473
00:31:22,393 --> 00:31:24,194
and I can't just stab
them in the back

474
00:31:24,228 --> 00:31:27,363
and I can't run away,
which is what we did at Craster's.

475
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:32,402
You have to trust me.

476
00:31:32,436 --> 00:31:34,070
It's for the best.

477
00:31:39,276 --> 00:31:40,643
Best for you.

478
00:31:40,678 --> 00:31:43,213
Oh, Gilly.

479
00:31:45,049 --> 00:31:46,449
Please don't.

480
00:32:19,183 --> 00:32:21,484
Greedy.

481
00:32:27,758 --> 00:32:29,759
No?

482
00:32:29,793 --> 00:32:31,628
I'm sorry.
You're lovely,

483
00:32:31,695 --> 00:32:33,596
I just never
acquired the taste.

484
00:32:33,631 --> 00:32:36,232
You're calling my beauty
an acquired taste?

485
00:32:36,267 --> 00:32:39,936
That's quite all right, lover.
It's more for you.

486
00:32:42,573 --> 00:32:45,074
Your loss.

487
00:32:49,847 --> 00:32:52,715
You like them
both the same?

488
00:32:52,783 --> 00:32:54,951
- Boys and girls?
- Does that surprise you?

489
00:32:54,985 --> 00:32:56,653
Everyone has a preference.

490
00:32:56,687 --> 00:32:59,455
Then everyone is missing
half the world's pleasure.

491
00:33:00,691 --> 00:33:04,394
<i>The gods made that</i>
<i>and it delights me.</i>

492
00:33:04,428 --> 00:33:06,229
The gods made this

493
00:33:06,263 --> 00:33:08,197
and it delights me.

494
00:33:08,232 --> 00:33:11,234
When it comes to war,
I fight for Dorne.

495
00:33:11,268 --> 00:33:15,038
When it comes to love,
I don't choose sides.

496
00:33:15,072 --> 00:33:17,407
I hope I have as much
stamina when I'm your age.

497
00:33:17,441 --> 00:33:19,108
What are you, 25?

498
00:33:19,143 --> 00:33:22,345
Children.

499
00:33:22,379 --> 00:33:24,814
Someday,
if you're lucky,

500
00:33:24,848 --> 00:33:26,616
you will wake up
and realize you are old.

501
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:28,651
That pretty ass
of yours will sag.

502
00:33:28,686 --> 00:33:32,088
Your belly will grow soft
and your back will ache in the night

503
00:33:32,122 --> 00:33:36,192
and gray hairs will sprout
from your ears.

504
00:33:36,226 --> 00:33:38,594
<i>No one will want</i>
<i>you anymore.</i>

505
00:33:38,629 --> 00:33:41,831
Make sure you fucked
your fill before that day.

506
00:33:43,267 --> 00:33:44,834
Did you?

507
00:33:44,868 --> 00:33:47,937
He is a prince of Dorne.

508
00:33:47,971 --> 00:33:50,873
Girls and boys
will line up

509
00:33:50,908 --> 00:33:53,843
to fuck him
till the day he dies.

510
00:33:56,313 --> 00:33:59,515
They will all have
to line up behind you.

511
00:34:04,888 --> 00:34:07,724
- <i>Prince Oberyn.</i>
- Lord Tywin.

512
00:34:07,758 --> 00:34:10,026
May we have the room?

513
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:15,798
Call my name
if you need me, lover.

514
00:34:26,577 --> 00:34:28,211
Would you like
to sit?

515
00:34:28,278 --> 00:34:30,580
No, thank you.

516
00:34:30,614 --> 00:34:32,181
Some wine?

517
00:34:32,216 --> 00:34:34,217
<i>No, thank you.</i>

518
00:34:36,053 --> 00:34:38,721
- I'm sorry about your grandson.
- Are you?

519
00:34:38,756 --> 00:34:42,792
I don't believe that a child is
responsible for the sins of his father.

520
00:34:42,826 --> 00:34:45,495
Or his grandfather.

521
00:34:45,529 --> 00:34:47,764
An awful way to die.

522
00:34:47,798 --> 00:34:49,999
Which way is that?

523
00:34:50,033 --> 00:34:53,236
Are you interrogating
me, Lord Tywin?

524
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:54,771
Some believe
the king choked.

525
00:34:54,805 --> 00:34:57,273
Some believe the sky
is blue because we live

526
00:34:57,307 --> 00:34:59,876
inside the eye
of a blue-eyed giant.

527
00:35:01,779 --> 00:35:04,080
The king was poisoned.

528
00:35:04,114 --> 00:35:07,183
I hear you studied
poisons at the Citadel.

529
00:35:07,217 --> 00:35:09,585
I did.
This is why I know.

530
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:13,089
Your hatred for my family
is rather well known.

531
00:35:13,123 --> 00:35:16,125
You arrive at the capital,
an expert in poisoning,

532
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:19,929
some days later my grandson
dies of poisoning.

533
00:35:19,963 --> 00:35:21,297
Rather suspicious.

534
00:35:21,331 --> 00:35:23,232
Why haven't you thrown
me in a dungeon?

535
00:35:23,267 --> 00:35:25,735
You spoke with Tyrion
in this very brothel

536
00:35:25,769 --> 00:35:28,004
on the day
that you arrived.

537
00:35:28,038 --> 00:35:29,305
What did you discuss?

538
00:35:29,339 --> 00:35:31,374
You think
we conspired together?

539
00:35:31,408 --> 00:35:32,775
What did you discuss?

540
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:36,179
The death of my sister.

541
00:35:36,213 --> 00:35:37,847
For which you blame me.

542
00:35:37,881 --> 00:35:40,049
She was raped and murdered
by the Mountain.

543
00:35:40,083 --> 00:35:42,919
The Mountain follows
your orders.

544
00:35:42,953 --> 00:35:44,554
Of course I blame you.

545
00:35:44,588 --> 00:35:47,023
Here I stand unarmed,
unguarded.

546
00:35:47,057 --> 00:35:48,658
Should I be concerned?

547
00:35:48,692 --> 00:35:52,295
You are unarmed and unguarded
because you know me better than that.

548
00:35:52,329 --> 00:35:54,864
I am a man of reason.

549
00:35:54,898 --> 00:35:56,866
If I cut
your throat today,

550
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,568
I will be drawn
and quartered tomorrow.

551
00:35:58,635 --> 00:36:00,636
Men at war commit
all kinds of crimes

552
00:36:00,671 --> 00:36:02,472
without their
superiors' knowledge.

553
00:36:02,506 --> 00:36:05,007
So you deny involvement
in Elia's murder?

554
00:36:05,042 --> 00:36:07,777
Categorically.

555
00:36:16,987 --> 00:36:19,355
I would like to speak
with the Mountain.

556
00:36:19,389 --> 00:36:22,191
I'm sure he would enjoy
speaking with you.

557
00:36:22,226 --> 00:36:25,094
He might not enjoy it as much
as he thinks he would.

558
00:36:26,497 --> 00:36:29,665
I could arrange
for this meeting.

559
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:33,469
But you want
something in return.

560
00:36:33,504 --> 00:36:36,072
There will be a trial
for my son.

561
00:36:36,106 --> 00:36:38,174
And as custom dictates,

562
00:36:38,208 --> 00:36:41,110
three judges
will render a verdict.

563
00:36:41,144 --> 00:36:42,545
I will preside.

564
00:36:42,579 --> 00:36:45,748
Mace Tyrell will serve
as the second judge.

565
00:36:45,782 --> 00:36:48,084
I would like you
to be the third.

566
00:36:48,118 --> 00:36:49,986
Why?

567
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:53,523
Not long ago, the Tyrells
sided with Renly Baratheon.

568
00:36:53,557 --> 00:36:56,459
Declared themselves
enemies of the throne.

569
00:36:56,527 --> 00:36:58,628
Now they are
our strongest allies.

570
00:36:58,662 --> 00:37:00,863
Well, you made
the Tyrell girl a queen.

571
00:37:00,898 --> 00:37:04,634
Asking me to judge at your son's trial
isn't quite as tempting.

572
00:37:04,668 --> 00:37:08,504
I will also invite you
to sit on the small council

573
00:37:08,572 --> 00:37:12,174
to serve as one of the new
king's principal advisors.

574
00:37:17,915 --> 00:37:22,585
I never realized you had such respect
for Dorne, Lord Tywin.

575
00:37:22,653 --> 00:37:26,222
We are not the Seven Kingdoms
until Dorne returns to the fold.

576
00:37:26,256 --> 00:37:30,026
The king is dead.
The Greyjoys are in open rebellion.

577
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:33,296
A wildling army
marches on the Wall.

578
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:37,767
And in the East, a Targaryen
girl has three dragons.

579
00:37:39,803 --> 00:37:42,872
Before long, she will
turn her eyes to Westeros.

580
00:37:42,906 --> 00:37:45,775
Only the Dornish
managed to resist

581
00:37:45,809 --> 00:37:48,644
Aegon Targaryen
and his dragons.

582
00:37:48,679 --> 00:37:51,547
You're saying
you need us?

583
00:37:53,183 --> 00:37:55,685
That must be hard
for you to admit.

584
00:37:55,719 --> 00:37:58,654
We need each other.

585
00:37:58,689 --> 00:38:02,391
You help me serve justice
to the king's assassins

586
00:38:02,426 --> 00:38:05,394
and I will help you
serve justice to Elia's.

587
00:38:24,114 --> 00:38:26,115
Podrick.

588
00:38:27,551 --> 00:38:28,985
Apologies for the stench.

589
00:38:29,019 --> 00:38:31,454
I brought you some wine, my lord,
but they took it from me.

590
00:38:31,488 --> 00:38:33,255
A noble effort.

591
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:35,591
They didn't find
the candles, though.

592
00:38:35,626 --> 00:38:37,893
A quill, some parchment,

593
00:38:37,928 --> 00:38:40,730
duck sausage,
almonds,

594
00:38:40,764 --> 00:38:43,833
and some hard cheese.

595
00:38:43,867 --> 00:38:45,635
You're a good lad.

596
00:38:45,669 --> 00:38:47,737
Any word of Shae?

597
00:38:47,771 --> 00:38:49,372
I've heard nothing,
my lord.

598
00:38:49,406 --> 00:38:52,141
I suppose
that's a good thing.

599
00:38:53,610 --> 00:38:56,045
What are they
saying about me out there?

600
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:59,115
You're to stand trial
in a fortnight

601
00:38:59,149 --> 00:39:00,916
for murdering the king.

602
00:39:00,951 --> 00:39:03,119
Do you believe
I murdered Joffrey?

603
00:39:03,153 --> 00:39:04,987
No, my lord.

604
00:39:05,022 --> 00:39:06,856
You didn't?

605
00:39:06,890 --> 00:39:09,592
No. Gods, no.

606
00:39:09,626 --> 00:39:11,794
The world is a better
place without him,

607
00:39:11,828 --> 00:39:14,063
but I had nothing
to do with it.

608
00:39:14,097 --> 00:39:16,132
I would like to think

609
00:39:16,166 --> 00:39:18,267
if I were arranging
a royal assassination,

610
00:39:18,301 --> 00:39:20,803
I'd plan it in such a way that
I wouldn't be standing there

611
00:39:20,837 --> 00:39:23,939
gawking like a fool
when the king died.

612
00:39:25,409 --> 00:39:28,044
Trial in a fortnight.

613
00:39:28,078 --> 00:39:30,513
<i>Have they announced</i>
<i>the judges yet?</i>

614
00:39:32,716 --> 00:39:35,951
- Your father.
- Of course.

615
00:39:35,986 --> 00:39:38,521
Mace Tyrell.

616
00:39:38,555 --> 00:39:41,824
Who will vote exactly
as my father tells him to vote.

617
00:39:41,858 --> 00:39:44,293
And Prince Oberyn
of Dorne.

618
00:39:44,361 --> 00:39:46,228
Oberyn?

619
00:39:46,263 --> 00:39:48,597
Give it to my father.

620
00:39:48,632 --> 00:39:51,367
He never fails to take advantage
of a family tragedy.

621
00:39:51,401 --> 00:39:54,670
I'm supposed to get a list
of names from you, my lord.

622
00:39:54,705 --> 00:39:57,707
Anyone who might testify
on your behalf.

623
00:39:57,741 --> 00:40:00,176
Oh, I can call
my own witnesses?

624
00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:01,744
<i>How generous of them.</i>

625
00:40:01,778 --> 00:40:03,746
Very well, my wife.
Sansa.

626
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:05,448
My lord, she's gone.

627
00:40:05,482 --> 00:40:06,662
Gone?

628
00:40:06,687 --> 00:40:08,548
<i>No one's seen her</i>
<i>since the wedding.</i>

629
00:40:11,888 --> 00:40:14,323
You don't think she...

630
00:40:17,894 --> 00:40:21,297
<i>No one had more cause</i>
<i>to kill Joffrey than Sansa,</i>

631
00:40:21,331 --> 00:40:23,232
but the girl
is no assassin.

632
00:40:23,266 --> 00:40:26,502
Whoever killed the king wanted me
to lose my head for it.

633
00:40:26,536 --> 00:40:30,206
And with my wife's disappearance,
it makes me seem that much more guilty.

634
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,908
- Podrick.
- Yes, my lord?

635
00:40:32,943 --> 00:40:34,577
- They'll be following you now.
- Who will?

636
00:40:34,611 --> 00:40:37,413
I don't know. They.
They. The ominous they.

637
00:40:37,447 --> 00:40:40,382
The man pulling the strings.
Or woman. My father.

638
00:40:40,417 --> 00:40:43,819
Maybe Joffrey
was too much work for him.

639
00:40:43,854 --> 00:40:46,789
Sweet Tommen will be
so much easier to handle.

640
00:40:46,823 --> 00:40:49,625
Whenever something
bad happens to me,

641
00:40:49,659 --> 00:40:52,061
I assume it's my sister
that had a hand in it.

642
00:40:52,095 --> 00:40:54,663
<i>But say what</i>
<i>you will of Cersei,</i>

643
00:40:54,698 --> 00:40:56,332
she loves her children.

644
00:40:56,366 --> 00:40:57,810
She is the only one

645
00:40:57,835 --> 00:41:00,174
I'm certain had nothing
to do with this murder.

646
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:02,438
Which makes it unique

647
00:41:02,472 --> 00:41:04,840
as King's Landing
murders go.

648
00:41:04,875 --> 00:41:07,810
Any other witnesses,
my lord?

649
00:41:07,844 --> 00:41:09,945
Varys could vouch
for me if he dared.

650
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:12,181
He's already been called
as a witness for the queen.

651
00:41:12,215 --> 00:41:14,583
Of course. Fetch Bronn.
I have a job for him.

652
00:41:14,618 --> 00:41:15,951
I've already asked,
my lord.

653
00:41:15,986 --> 00:41:17,386
- They won't let him see you.
- Why not?

654
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:20,489
They say he's a known cutthroat
and your close associate.

655
00:41:20,524 --> 00:41:21,924
He's under
investigation himself.

656
00:41:21,958 --> 00:41:22,777
And my brother?

657
00:41:23,682 --> 00:41:25,461
Will they at least
allow me to see Jaime?

658
00:41:25,462 --> 00:41:28,030
I'll ask, my lord.

659
00:41:41,745 --> 00:41:43,813
There's something else,
my lord.

660
00:41:43,847 --> 00:41:47,616
A man,
I didn't know his face,

661
00:41:47,651 --> 00:41:50,252
he came to ask if
I'd testify against you.

662
00:41:50,287 --> 00:41:53,155
Said I'd be named
Ser Podrick Payne

663
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:56,692
if I told the judges you'd bought
a poison called the Strangler.

664
00:41:56,726 --> 00:41:58,828
Ser Podrick Payne?

665
00:41:58,862 --> 00:42:01,497
Has a nice ring to it.
What did you tell him?

666
00:42:01,531 --> 00:42:03,399
I didn't tell them
anything, my lord.

667
00:42:04,568 --> 00:42:06,635
Are you going to
accept their offer?

668
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:08,504
My lord.

669
00:42:08,538 --> 00:42:10,606
Testifying against me
wasn't a suggestion.

670
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,107
If they can't
tempt you with honey,

671
00:42:12,142 --> 00:42:13,909
they'll choose something
less sweet.

672
00:42:13,944 --> 00:42:15,277
You've been good
to me, my lord.

673
00:42:15,312 --> 00:42:17,813
Pod, the trial's in
a fortnight.

674
00:42:17,848 --> 00:42:19,515
They'll want an answer
before that.

675
00:42:19,549 --> 00:42:21,817
I already gave them
an answer, my lord.

676
00:42:23,086 --> 00:42:25,921
I will not have you
dying on my behalf.

677
00:42:25,956 --> 00:42:28,023
Do you hear me?
If I have to take

678
00:42:28,058 --> 00:42:29,859
that long walk to
the executioner's block,

679
00:42:29,893 --> 00:42:32,394
I don't want to see
your head already mounted.

680
00:42:32,429 --> 00:42:35,464
- My lord.
- Pod, I am giving you an order.

681
00:42:36,666 --> 00:42:40,002
Go and find my brother.
Tell him I need him.

682
00:42:40,036 --> 00:42:42,438
And get yourself
out of King's Landing

683
00:42:42,472 --> 00:42:44,406
before it's too late.

684
00:42:44,441 --> 00:42:46,041
Pod!

685
00:42:46,076 --> 00:42:47,977
This is farewell.

686
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:53,082
Farewell, my lord.

687
00:42:57,587 --> 00:43:00,222
Pod.

688
00:43:02,592 --> 00:43:05,961
There has never lived
a more loyal squire.

689
00:43:30,053 --> 00:43:31,720
Mother says
it's time to eat.

690
00:43:31,755 --> 00:43:35,024
What's she got boiling?
Wait. Wait. Let me guess.

691
00:43:35,058 --> 00:43:36,959
- Potatoes.
- Potatoes.

692
00:43:36,993 --> 00:43:40,029
Well, no one boils a potato
better than your mom.

693
00:43:40,063 --> 00:43:41,697
Has she got--

694
00:43:41,731 --> 00:43:44,400
<i>The wildlings!</i>

695
00:43:44,434 --> 00:43:45,834
Guymon!

696
00:43:47,237 --> 00:43:48,904
Hide.

697
00:43:48,939 --> 00:43:50,973
Hide!

698
00:44:41,658 --> 00:44:43,926
You know how to get
to Castle Black?

699
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:45,828
Yes. Yes.

700
00:44:53,269 --> 00:44:55,404
Those your parents?

701
00:44:56,773 --> 00:44:58,941
Open your eyes.

702
00:45:00,176 --> 00:45:01,910
I'm going to eat them.

703
00:45:01,945 --> 00:45:03,712
Do you hear me?

704
00:45:03,747 --> 00:45:06,415
I'm going to eat
your dead mama

705
00:45:06,449 --> 00:45:10,019
and I'm going to eat
your dead papa.

706
00:45:10,053 --> 00:45:13,622
Go tell the crows
at Castle Black.

707
00:45:21,965 --> 00:45:24,933
<i>We need to teach them a lesson</i>
<i>about the way we deal with their kind.</i>

708
00:45:24,968 --> 00:45:26,235
<i>Aye! Aye!</i>

709
00:45:26,269 --> 00:45:28,029
<i>Three dozen bodies</i>
<i>with slit throats</i>

710
00:45:28,038 --> 00:45:30,172
<i>tossed off the top</i>
<i>of the Wall.</i>

711
00:45:30,206 --> 00:45:31,350
Seems like that would
be a good lesson.

712
00:45:31,375 --> 00:45:32,341
Aye!

713
00:45:32,342 --> 00:45:35,077
If we go after them,
we'll be giving them what they want.

714
00:45:35,111 --> 00:45:37,279
They want to draw us out,

715
00:45:37,313 --> 00:45:39,615
pick us off
a few at a time.

716
00:45:39,649 --> 00:45:42,384
We have just over
100 men.

717
00:45:42,419 --> 00:45:46,155
And that's including
stewards and builders.

718
00:45:46,189 --> 00:45:49,691
And me. We can't afford
to lose a single man.

719
00:45:49,726 --> 00:45:53,729
We must remember our
first responsibility.

720
00:45:53,763 --> 00:45:57,132
We are the watchers
on the Wall.

721
00:45:57,167 --> 00:46:00,135
There's got to be
a way to protect them.

722
00:46:01,638 --> 00:46:04,273
You're a champion
of the common people, Lord Snow.

723
00:46:04,307 --> 00:46:07,242
<i>What do you say to</i>
<i>Brother Pyp's proposition?</i>

724
00:46:11,147 --> 00:46:13,682
Mance Rayder is coming.

725
00:46:15,285 --> 00:46:17,719
If the wildlings
breach the Wall,

726
00:46:17,754 --> 00:46:20,622
they'll roll over everything
and everyone for 1,000 miles

727
00:46:20,657 --> 00:46:22,724
before they reach an army
that can stop them.

728
00:46:25,895 --> 00:46:29,098
We need to shore up
Castle Black

729
00:46:29,132 --> 00:46:32,568
and we need
to defend the Wall.

730
00:46:32,602 --> 00:46:35,037
<i>That is our job.</i>

731
00:46:41,344 --> 00:46:43,011
Rangers returning.

732
00:46:49,152 --> 00:46:50,986
Help him.

733
00:46:53,123 --> 00:46:56,091
Thought you'd have
blue eyes by now.

734
00:46:59,829 --> 00:47:01,697
What took you so long?

735
00:47:01,731 --> 00:47:03,632
- We were held up.
- By what?

736
00:47:03,666 --> 00:47:05,000
Chains.

737
00:47:05,034 --> 00:47:08,737
We were guests of the mutineers
at Craster's Keep.

738
00:47:08,771 --> 00:47:11,507
- And the mutineers stayed?
- They're not going anywhere.

739
00:47:11,541 --> 00:47:13,976
They've got Craster's food
and his wives.

740
00:47:14,010 --> 00:47:16,411
<i>Poor girls.</i>

741
00:47:16,446 --> 00:47:18,514
Never thought they'd
miss their daddy.

742
00:47:18,548 --> 00:47:20,048
Karl's running things now.

743
00:47:20,083 --> 00:47:22,584
He's the one who put a knife
through Craster's mouth.

744
00:47:22,619 --> 00:47:24,386
We need to ride north
and kill them all.

745
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:25,921
We just went
over this, boy.

746
00:47:25,955 --> 00:47:28,457
- Justice can wait.
- It's not about justice.

747
00:47:30,293 --> 00:47:34,496
I told the wildlings we had over
1,000 men at Castle Black alone.

748
00:47:36,332 --> 00:47:40,002
Karl and the others know
the truth as well as we do.

749
00:47:40,036 --> 00:47:42,538
How long do you think they'll keep that
information to themselves

750
00:47:42,572 --> 00:47:46,008
when the wildlings
are peeling their fingernails off?

751
00:47:46,042 --> 00:47:49,678
Mance has all he needs
to crush us, he just doesn't know it yet.

752
00:47:49,712 --> 00:47:53,081
As soon as he gets
his hands on them, he will.

753
00:47:53,116 --> 00:47:55,684
Then he'll throw
his full strength at us.

754
00:47:55,718 --> 00:47:59,121
And even if every one
of us kills 100 wildlings,

755
00:47:59,155 --> 00:48:02,090
there's still not a thing
we can do to stop them.

756
00:48:04,227 --> 00:48:06,595
I don't think I can
kill 100 wildlings.

757
00:49:09,158 --> 00:49:10,892
<i>Are they attacking?</i>

758
00:49:10,927 --> 00:49:14,162
<i>A single rider.</i>

759
00:49:14,197 --> 00:49:17,332
<i>A champion of Meereen.</i>

760
00:49:17,367 --> 00:49:20,469
<i>They want you to send your</i>
<i>own champion against him.</i>

761
00:49:46,296 --> 00:49:48,363
What is he doing?

762
00:49:48,398 --> 00:49:50,565
I believe he means to...

763
00:49:58,241 --> 00:50:01,843
He says that we're an army
of men without man parts.

764
00:50:01,878 --> 00:50:05,047
He claims you are no woman
at all, but a man who...

765
00:50:05,081 --> 00:50:07,983
hides his cock
in his own asshole.

766
00:50:08,017 --> 00:50:10,986
Ignore him, Your Grace.
These are meaningless words.

767
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:12,275
They're not meaningless

768
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:14,489
if half the city you intend
to take is listening to them.

769
00:50:18,394 --> 00:50:21,463
I have something to say
to the people of Meereen.

770
00:50:22,732 --> 00:50:26,001
First, I will need
this one to be quiet.

771
00:50:26,035 --> 00:50:27,769
Do I have a champion?

772
00:50:37,647 --> 00:50:41,483
Your Grace, I've won more
single combats than any man alive.

773
00:50:41,517 --> 00:50:44,353
Which is why you must
remain by my side.

774
00:50:44,387 --> 00:50:47,823
I've been by your side
longer than any of them, Khaleesi.

775
00:50:47,857 --> 00:50:49,491
Let me stand for you
today as well.

776
00:50:49,525 --> 00:50:51,460
You are my most
trusted advisor,

777
00:50:51,494 --> 00:50:54,496
my most valued general,
and my dearest friend.

778
00:50:54,530 --> 00:50:56,365
I will not gamble
with your life.

779
00:50:56,399 --> 00:50:58,734
I was the last
to join your army.

780
00:50:58,768 --> 00:51:01,136
I'm not your general
or a member of your Queensguard

781
00:51:01,170 --> 00:51:02,404
or the commander
of your Unsullied.

782
00:51:02,438 --> 00:51:05,440
My mother was a whore.
I come from nothing.

783
00:51:05,475 --> 00:51:08,110
And before long,
I will return to nothing.

784
00:51:09,512 --> 00:51:11,980
Let me kill
this man for you.

785
00:51:12,849 --> 00:51:14,216
Very well.

786
00:51:14,250 --> 00:51:15,717
You have quite
an audience.

787
00:51:15,752 --> 00:51:18,487
Make it worth
their while.

788
00:51:19,889 --> 00:51:21,957
