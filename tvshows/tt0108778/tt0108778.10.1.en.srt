1
00:00:07,407 --> 00:00:09,810
Oh, the way you crushed Mike at ping pong 

2
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,078
was such a turn-on.

3
00:00:12,145 --> 00:00:13,180
You wanna...? 

4
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:16,984
I'd love to, but I'm a little tired.

5
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:19,186
- I'll put a pillowcase over my head.
- You're on!

6
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:22,990
What's up?

7
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:26,360
Mike's taking a shower, which by the way there's no law against. 

8
00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:31,365
And then we're gonna grab some food, so if you want...

9
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,270
- Is that Ross?
- Yeah, you can hear everything through these stupid walls.

10
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:39,339
Sounds like he's with someone.

11
00:00:39,773 --> 00:00:40,707
He could be alone. 

12
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:43,677
This morning I heard him do push-ups, and then talk to his triceps.

13
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:45,712
Wait a minute, I think Phoebe's right. 

14
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:48,448
I hear someone else in there with him.

15
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,023
Dr Geller !

16
00:00:56,323 --> 00:00:59,393
God, you're amazing... I didn't even have to ask you to call me that.

17
00:01:02,095 --> 00:01:03,864
Oh my God, that's Charlie!

18
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:05,532
She's cheating on Joey with Ross!

19
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,536
Oh that tart... floozy... giant...

20
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:14,208
I'm not sure about this.

21
00:01:14,675 --> 00:01:16,243
You're right. This is none of our business.

22
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,112
No I'm not sure that it's the best way to hear everything. 

23
00:01:19,146 --> 00:01:20,347
Someone get me a glass!

24
00:01:21,648 --> 00:01:24,351
Oh, I'm not gonna do this, okay? I'm not gonna eavesdrop on my friend.

25
00:01:25,352 --> 00:01:26,587
I love Barbados! 

26
00:01:34,361 --> 00:01:35,796
I can't believe I'm kissing you. 

27
00:01:36,496 --> 00:01:37,130
I'm kissing Rachel!

28
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:40,567
I know, I'm her!

29
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:44,938
Rachel and Joey! It's Rachel and Joey!

30
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:46,139
What?

31
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:47,341
Get over here!

32
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:55,749
I love how thin these walls are!

38
00:02:59,713 --> 00:03:01,849
Before you said that nothing could happen between us? 

39
00:03:01,882 --> 00:03:03,250
What changed?

40
00:03:03,784 --> 00:03:05,185
I only said that because of Ross.

41
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:07,721
Then I saw him kissing Charlie...

42
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:08,155
What? 

43
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:10,157
Ross and Charlie ?

44
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:14,061
She's really making her way through the group, huh?

45
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,433
Ah, who am I to talk?

46
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:24,938
I can't believe this. Rachel and Joey?

47
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:27,107
How about the dinosaur twins in the other room? 

48
00:03:28,609 --> 00:03:30,410
No-one is manning that wall!

49
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:32,679
I'm on it!

50
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:35,382
Anything?

51
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:36,783
I think I hear curtains closing... 

52
00:03:37,284 --> 00:03:38,785
We've got shoes being kicked off over here.

53
00:03:40,487 --> 00:03:41,922
Bedsprings, unmistakable!

54
00:03:43,857 --> 00:03:45,125
You do realise that's your brother?

55
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,461
Not until you said it. Somebody switch! 

56
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,632
Wait a minute... 

57
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,033
Ross and Charlie,

58
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:54,401
Joey and Rachel,

59
00:03:55,169 --> 00:03:55,936
Phoebe and Mike...

60
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:58,305
We're the only people leaving with the same person we came with.

61
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:01,408
That's not true. I came with Monica and I'm leaving with Weird Al.

62
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:05,279
I've had it with the hair jokes. 

63
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:08,148
Tomorrow morning, before we leave, I'm going to the salon.

64
00:04:08,182 --> 00:04:09,183
Okay Buckwheat!

65
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:15,289
You gotta hear this, it's great... It's like free porn! 

66
00:04:23,864 --> 00:04:24,498
Is everything okay?

67
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:27,367
It's just... I don't think I can do this...

68
00:04:28,836 --> 00:04:32,439
Is it because of what might be on the bedspread, because I saw that news report too, with the infra red and the... 

69
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:33,974
No ! No !

70
00:04:37,244 --> 00:04:40,380
I need to talk to Joey. I mean, you guys just broke up. 

71
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:43,183
Before anything more happens between us, 

72
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:44,751
I need to know he's okay with it.

73
00:04:45,853 --> 00:04:47,621
I completely understand.

74
00:04:48,055 --> 00:04:48,922
Alright, I'm gonna go find them... 

75
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,896
I just need a... need a before I can... you know. 

76
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:02,503
Grandma... grandma... 

77
00:05:10,844 --> 00:05:11,612
Okay, I see you later.

78
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:15,916
That's the door. He's gone...

79
00:05:17,117 --> 00:05:18,819
And she's... turning on the TV... 

80
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,590
and watching... Miss Congeniality!

81
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:27,394
Honey, if you know it through a wall, 

82
00:05:27,728 --> 00:05:28,762
you know it too well!

83
00:05:37,404 --> 00:05:38,572
Hey, what are you guys doing?

84
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:46,813
Oh, we're sad to go so we're just saying goodbye to the hotel. 

85
00:05:47,147 --> 00:05:51,018
I love you... Paradise Hotel, 

86
00:05:51,251 --> 00:05:53,287
Golf resort and Spa... 

87
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,192
Yeah, we had a great time, thank you! 

88
00:06:03,297 --> 00:06:04,064
Bye !

89
00:06:07,768 --> 00:06:09,036
Hey, you guys seen Joey anywhere?

90
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:12,139
He's probably in his room with his current girlfriend Charlie. 

91
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,175
That's the situation as we know it... 

92
00:06:18,679 --> 00:06:21,215
If you see him could you please tell him I'm looking for him?

93
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:22,349
- You got it!
- Thanks! 

94
00:06:26,954 --> 00:06:27,621
Thank you! 

95
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,162
Other wall, people! Other wall!

96
00:06:40,167 --> 00:06:41,001
Rach, you there? 

97
00:06:41,668 --> 00:06:43,370
Oh my God, it's Ross. What are we gonna do?

98
00:06:43,637 --> 00:06:47,307
Just be calm. For all he knows we're just hanging out together.

99
00:06:47,674 --> 00:06:49,076
Just be nonchalant. 

100
00:06:56,216 --> 00:06:57,351
That's not nonchalant!

101
00:06:57,784 --> 00:06:58,719
No idea what it means.

102
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:02,022
Okay, just hide!

103
00:07:03,323 --> 00:07:03,957
Coming! 

104
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:05,893
Try under the bed!

105
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:11,932
There's no room under the bed.

106
00:07:14,168 --> 00:07:14,801
Is everything okay?

107
00:07:26,346 --> 00:07:29,516
- You know where Joey is?
- I really don't... 

108
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,622
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- Yeah, sure... 

109
00:07:39,326 --> 00:07:40,027
I don't believe this... 

110
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:43,697
- Have you guys been...
- Shhh... This is the listening side of the wall.

111
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:52,873
And then she told me that she and Joey had broken up, 

112
00:07:53,373 --> 00:07:55,676
and that part of the reason was that she had feelings for me.

113
00:07:56,176 --> 00:07:57,578
Right... yeah...

114
00:07:58,245 --> 00:08:00,781
And you know I wanted to ask Charlie out since the day I met her.

115
00:08:01,181 --> 00:08:03,383
I know it's been really hard for you.

116
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:07,721
Anyway, one thing lead to another, and before you know it, 

117
00:08:08,021 --> 00:08:09,756
we were kissing. 

118
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:12,292
How angry do you think Joey is gonna be?

119
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,362
That is hard to say, Ross. That is hard to say.

120
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:19,666
I gotta go find him. He's gotta be here someplace.

121
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,001
You would think!

122
00:08:28,408 --> 00:08:29,376
Is he gone?

123
00:08:29,643 --> 00:08:31,144
How are you doing this?

124
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:39,419
What is this? Have you guys been listening this entire time?

125
00:08:42,556 --> 00:08:43,557
Now, what is this?

126
00:08:44,591 --> 00:08:48,929
Ah, what is this? Well, lets see, we kissed for ten minutes and now we're talking to our friends about it, 

127
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:50,831
so I guess this is sixth grade!

128
00:08:53,267 --> 00:08:56,370
Have you thought about it how complicated this could get? What about Ross?

129
00:08:57,104 --> 00:08:58,071
Well, he's with Charlie now.

130
00:08:58,739 --> 00:09:01,175
Yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything really happens with her. 

131
00:09:01,942 --> 00:09:04,178
And as his friend, don't you think he deserves the same from you?

132
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,285
You're a pain in my ass, Geller!

133
00:09:14,121 --> 00:09:16,490
All right, look you guys... we appreciate all the advice, 

134
00:09:16,523 --> 00:09:18,959
but this is between Joey and me and I think we can handle it...

135
00:09:18,992 --> 00:09:21,094
Okay, we'll go back in there, but will you do one thing for us? 

136
00:09:21,128 --> 00:09:23,063
- The people that care about you?
- Sure...

137
00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:24,164
Enunciate!

138
00:09:24,965 --> 00:09:25,866
Get out!

139
00:09:33,473 --> 00:09:34,341
Are they right?

140
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:39,179
Probably, yeah... I mean, maybe we should... 

141
00:09:39,213 --> 00:09:41,782
hold off until we talk to Ross.

142
00:09:43,483 --> 00:09:46,987
Yeah, we can wait, we don't have to do anything tonight.

143
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:49,223
Yeah, I think that'd be best... 

144
00:09:50,824 --> 00:09:52,092
So I'm gonna take off...

145
00:09:54,294 --> 00:09:55,696
- Although... 
- I like although!

146
00:09:57,698 --> 00:10:03,937
Ross and I haven't dated in like... six years...

147
00:10:04,905 --> 00:10:05,739
Six years? 

148
00:10:07,574 --> 00:10:10,043
It's almost as long as highschool...

149
00:10:15,549 --> 00:10:18,285
Plus, you know, he is with Charlie now.

150
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:19,586
Absolutely! 

151
00:10:20,754 --> 00:10:22,156
- He's not thinking about you.
- No.

152
00:10:24,358 --> 00:10:25,159
I'm thinking about you...

153
00:10:29,897 --> 00:10:31,765
Let's forget about Ross...

154
00:10:33,066 --> 00:10:33,700
Forgotten.

155
00:10:37,237 --> 00:10:37,604
What's wrong?

156
00:10:38,205 --> 00:10:38,605
Nothing...

157
00:10:39,106 --> 00:10:39,940
Seriously... What is it?

158
00:10:42,543 --> 00:10:44,311
Nothing... It's really... It's nothing. Come here...

159
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,515
What's wrong?

160
00:10:50,684 --> 00:10:54,454
Sorry, I can't seem to get Ross out of my head...

161
00:10:58,192 --> 00:10:59,059
Maybe I can help. 

162
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:08,368
Your lips are so soft... Do that again... 

163
00:11:11,872 --> 00:11:13,473
- We really need to talk to Ross...
- Yeah.

164
00:11:21,548 --> 00:11:22,916
You guys ready to go?

165
00:11:23,383 --> 00:11:26,019
Not quite. Monica's still at the salon, and I'm just finishing packing.

166
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,522
You're not taking your Bible?

167
00:11:30,991 --> 00:11:31,959
You're not supposed to take that. 

168
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:34,595
Besides, it's a New Testament, what are you gonna do with it?

169
00:11:35,696 --> 00:11:36,663
Learn about Jesus...

170
00:11:40,767 --> 00:11:42,703
So, did you talk to Joey?

171
00:11:43,103 --> 00:11:45,038
No. I couldn't find him. 

172
00:11:45,439 --> 00:11:47,040
I'm just gonna talk to him on the plane.

173
00:11:48,275 --> 00:11:49,142
Yeah, sounds like a good idea... 

174
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:51,178
Dr Geller !

175
00:11:52,513 --> 00:11:53,347
Stop it!

176
00:11:55,115 --> 00:11:56,650
PHD.

177
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:58,852
You're filthy!

178
00:12:01,155 --> 00:12:02,356
Have you guys seen Monica?

179
00:12:02,789 --> 00:12:04,391
Actually I think she went to the salon.

180
00:12:04,825 --> 00:12:06,727
Oh yeah, she went to the salon alright...

181
00:12:07,294 --> 00:12:08,395
Check it out!

182
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:12,699
Who's day just got better? 

183
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:21,975
What do you think?

184
00:12:22,643 --> 00:12:23,243
I think...

185
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:25,312
I think I can see your scalp.

186
00:12:27,447 --> 00:12:28,282
Don't you just love it?

187
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:29,550
Yeah... 

188
00:12:30,217 --> 00:12:31,518
You got shellfish in your head.

189
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,555
It's so... something... 

190
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:36,089
You go girlfriend!

191
00:12:38,325 --> 00:12:39,626
You've never said that in your life, have you?

192
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,061
- Not once.
- I thought so.

193
00:12:42,029 --> 00:12:42,763
And listen to this... 

194
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:51,205
What d'ya know... It's a treat for the eyes and the ears.

195
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:10,123
It's kinda weird that I'm sitting next to Charlie after we broke up.

196
00:13:10,157 --> 00:13:13,327
It's almost if Air Barbados doesn't care about your social life.

197
00:13:15,262 --> 00:13:16,964
Does someone mind switching to sit with Charlie?

198
00:13:18,832 --> 00:13:21,535
I spent the whole conference with Charlie.

199
00:13:21,668 --> 00:13:23,237
- I understand...
- No, I'll do it. 

200
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:26,473
Wish I could switch with someone. 

201
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,208
I really don't wanna sit with Allen Iverson over there.

202
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:38,252
Once we're in the air and the captain turns off the seatbelt sign... 

203
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:40,320
you feel free to roam about my cabin...

204
00:13:42,723 --> 00:13:45,359
You should be careful when checking your overhead bins, 

205
00:13:46,927 --> 00:13:49,530
- 'cause items may shift during...
- You're not good at this...

206
00:13:54,134 --> 00:13:55,068
You don't have to go home tonight, do you?

207
00:13:55,769 --> 00:13:57,938
No, I think I can come over. It's Saturday, right?

208
00:13:58,605 --> 00:14:00,107
What?

209
00:14:02,142 --> 00:14:03,343
I can't do anything tonight.

210
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:04,845
Why not?

211
00:14:05,546 --> 00:14:06,213
I have a date.

212
00:14:07,447 --> 00:14:10,617
You have a date? With who?

213
00:14:12,953 --> 00:14:13,954
Oh, it's... my girlfriend.

214
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:16,824
You have a girlfriend?

215
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:20,794
When you and I broke up I started seeing someone.

216
00:14:22,129 --> 00:14:22,996
For how long?

217
00:14:23,397 --> 00:14:23,931
3 months.

218
00:14:24,264 --> 00:14:24,898
3 months!

219
00:14:28,669 --> 00:14:32,406
This is probably none of my business, but how long do you think you're gonna keep seeing her?

220
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:36,643
I'll tell her that it's over tonight at dinner. I promise.

221
00:14:37,244 --> 00:14:38,612
Okay... good. You do that. 

222
00:14:39,913 --> 00:14:43,951
And then when you get home, maybe there'll be a special delivery package waiting for you.

223
00:14:46,086 --> 00:14:48,689
Maybe I'll sign for it. Tear it open. 

224
00:14:51,258 --> 00:14:52,426
Pull out the packing material...

225
00:14:52,926 --> 00:14:54,761
You know what, we're gonna have sex. Let's just leave it there.

226
00:15:02,336 --> 00:15:04,671
I'm gonna go talk to Joey. I think this is the right time. 

227
00:15:05,539 --> 00:15:08,375
He's always in a good mood after the flight attendant says "duty free".

228
00:15:09,977 --> 00:15:11,011
Good luck.

229
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:18,118
Ross is coming over. I think now would be a really good time to talk to him.

230
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,488
I guess so. I'm just... really nervous.

231
00:15:22,055 --> 00:15:26,059
Well keep in mind that by the time you're done, they'll probably be serving dinner.

232
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:30,063
Still nervous?

233
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:33,133
I'm gonna get the lasagna.

234
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:36,203
Rach' !

235
00:15:36,904 --> 00:15:39,940
- Do you mind if I sit here for a sec.?
- Yeah sure! 

236
00:15:50,184 --> 00:15:53,587
I kinda need to talk to you about Charlie.

237
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:58,225
Okay, last night after you guys broke up... 

238
00:15:59,126 --> 00:16:00,594
so sorry to hear about that, by the way... 

239
00:16:04,665 --> 00:16:06,466
Charlie and I were talking, and...

240
00:16:11,505 --> 00:16:12,439
You kissed.

241
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,242
What? 

242
00:16:17,544 --> 00:16:20,013
What would give you that idea?

243
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,583
- I saw you.
- Yeah, we kissed, 

244
00:16:24,685 --> 00:16:27,988
but... nothing else happened, okay.

245
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:30,491
It's okay.

246
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:31,825
What?

247
00:16:32,359 --> 00:16:33,093
It's okay.

248
00:16:34,228 --> 00:16:36,530
I totally understand, alright? 

249
00:16:36,897 --> 00:16:40,100
You guys, make way more sense than her and I ever did.

250
00:16:42,302 --> 00:16:44,137
And... I want you to be happy.

251
00:16:45,205 --> 00:16:47,207
- Are you serious?
- Yeah... 

252
00:16:51,044 --> 00:16:53,147
- Now I have something...
- I am speachless... 

253
00:16:55,849 --> 00:16:58,385
I mean the fact that you would put my happiness first like that. 

254
00:16:59,653 --> 00:17:01,488
You're an incredible friend, 

255
00:17:01,955 --> 00:17:02,489
you know that?

256
00:17:03,524 --> 00:17:04,224
Before you...

257
00:17:04,725 --> 00:17:05,659
No, I mean it. 

258
00:17:05,993 --> 00:17:07,628
You are so loyal man, 

259
00:17:08,395 --> 00:17:09,997
and selfless, 

260
00:17:10,464 --> 00:17:11,698
and generous...

261
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:14,968
I am those things, yeah.

262
00:17:16,036 --> 00:17:17,871
I know Chandler longer, 

263
00:17:18,205 --> 00:17:20,707
so I always think of him as my best friend, but now... 

264
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:25,045
I may have to rethink some stuff...

265
00:17:28,115 --> 00:17:30,984
Hey, if there is ever, anything I can do for you...

266
00:17:34,388 --> 00:17:35,522
I can't think of anything.

267
00:17:39,092 --> 00:17:39,860
Thanks!

268
00:17:46,366 --> 00:17:47,734
So you talked to Joey?

269
00:17:48,402 --> 00:17:51,038
Ah, yeah. We had a really good talk.

270
00:17:51,438 --> 00:17:52,306
That's great!

271
00:17:53,106 --> 00:17:54,074
Oh, so everything's okay?

272
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:58,445
It's great. He is an amazing guy.

273
00:17:58,779 --> 00:18:01,482
Well, obviously I think so too.

274
00:18:02,616 --> 00:18:04,852
I'm so excited about this.

275
00:18:06,386 --> 00:18:07,254
Really? 

276
00:18:08,188 --> 00:18:09,122
Excited?

277
00:18:10,157 --> 00:18:11,024
Are you kidding? 

278
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:14,328
I have had some very dirty dreams about this...

279
00:18:18,232 --> 00:18:18,999
Excuse me! 

280
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:28,008
You didn't tell him, did you?

281
00:18:28,909 --> 00:18:29,576
I couldn't. 

282
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:31,912
He was saying all these really nice things about me.

283
00:18:32,346 --> 00:18:33,614
I didn't want him to get mad and take 'em all back. 

284
00:18:33,847 --> 00:18:35,516
- I'm on a edge on Chandler.
- Oh God! 

285
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:40,454
Fine. Forget it. When we go back to New York, I will tell him.

286
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:42,523
Thank you. Yeah, I appreciate that.

287
00:19:01,675 --> 00:19:03,110
Hi, Mike's place.

288
00:19:03,143 --> 00:19:04,912
Hey, it's Mike.

289
00:19:05,012 --> 00:19:06,046
Oh, that was fast.

290
00:19:06,713 --> 00:19:07,748
No, she's not here yet. 

291
00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:12,085
I think I'm just gonna take off and break up with her over the phone...

292
00:19:12,653 --> 00:19:15,722
You can't do that! Come on Mike, strap on a pair.

293
00:19:18,492 --> 00:19:20,494
Why don't you just tell her that we got back together. 

294
00:19:20,794 --> 00:19:22,296
You know, women appreciate honesty. 

295
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:27,234
We also appreciate gentle spanking once in a while. Just F.Y.I.

296
00:19:28,202 --> 00:19:34,074
One more thing... There might be a picture of Precious on my coffee table.

297
00:19:34,675 --> 00:19:35,742
Her name is Precious? 

298
00:19:36,977 --> 00:19:37,978
Is she a purebreed or did you pick her up at the pound?

299
00:19:41,348 --> 00:19:42,983
Anyway, I just wanna give you a heads up. 

300
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:47,621
Okay, if she gets upset, just scratch her tummy and give her a liver snout. 

301
00:19:58,098 --> 00:19:59,433
Hi, I'm Precious, who are you?

302
00:20:01,268 --> 00:20:02,269
I'm Phoebe.

303
00:20:02,636 --> 00:20:05,973
Phoebe? Mike's ex-girlfriend Phoebe, the love of his life? 

304
00:20:06,773 --> 00:20:07,708
That Phoebe?

305
00:20:13,313 --> 00:20:16,383
Oh, I can't wait for everyone at work to see these... 

306
00:20:19,219 --> 00:20:20,954
You go back to work tomorrow night, right?

307
00:20:21,788 --> 00:20:26,560
So if you want people to see them, then you're not having them taken out... say, at the break of dawn?

308
00:20:27,961 --> 00:20:31,064
If I had them taken out, then I wouldn't be able to do this. 

309
00:20:38,305 --> 00:20:39,072
You like that, right? 

310
00:20:47,447 --> 00:20:48,382
What are you singing?

311
00:20:48,649 --> 00:20:50,651
It's "Bolero" from "10".

312
00:20:50,784 --> 00:20:53,153
It's "Ride of the Valkyries" from "Apocalypse Now"... 

313
00:20:55,355 --> 00:20:58,125
See, here's the thing: The corn rose were really a solution to your frizzy hair problem.

314
00:20:58,959 --> 00:21:02,162
And now that we're home, we don't have that problem anymore, so if you think about it...

315
00:21:02,396 --> 00:21:03,530
I hate them!

316
00:21:05,632 --> 00:21:07,401
You what? You said you liked them.

317
00:21:07,734 --> 00:21:08,535
Did I? 

318
00:21:08,836 --> 00:21:12,039
Let's refresh. I believe what I said was that I could see your scalp.

319
00:21:14,341 --> 00:21:16,610
Fine, so you don't like them. Everybody else does.

320
00:21:17,578 --> 00:21:19,346
Again, let's journey back... 

321
00:21:20,848 --> 00:21:24,718
As I recall what Rachel said, was she had never notice the shape of your skull before.

322
00:21:25,719 --> 00:21:26,587
And Joey...

323
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:29,556
Joey didn't realise that there was anything different.

324
00:21:30,657 --> 00:21:32,526
You know what? I don't care. 

325
00:21:32,626 --> 00:21:34,261
I like it like this, and I'm gonna keep it. 

326
00:21:34,628 --> 00:21:36,730
You're just jealous because your hair can't do this... 

327
00:21:40,968 --> 00:21:42,302
Hit yourself in the tooth?

328
00:21:42,703 --> 00:21:43,570
And the eye!

329
00:21:51,645 --> 00:22:00,721
There she is. Hi Emma. Oh my God, I missed you. I missed you so much. 

330
00:22:01,955 --> 00:22:03,891
Did you have a good time with grandma Green? 

331
00:22:05,292 --> 00:22:07,861
Did she give you a bottle of anti-depressants again 

332
00:22:08,095 --> 00:22:09,163
to use as a rattle? 

333
00:22:10,797 --> 00:22:13,600
That was one time, and they were only like 5 milligrams.

334
00:22:16,837 --> 00:22:19,907
Daddy has some presents for you okay. I want you to wait right here. Come here sweetie.

335
00:22:23,944 --> 00:22:27,781
Ross, actually there's something that I really need to talk to you about.

336
00:22:28,315 --> 00:22:28,949
Okay, shoot!

337
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:32,719
Alright, here's the deal.

338
00:22:33,453 --> 00:22:34,888
Oh no !

339
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:37,758
What is it?

340
00:22:38,358 --> 00:22:40,727
Oh, major shampoo explosion!

341
00:22:43,664 --> 00:22:44,998
Ross, this really isn't easy.

342
00:22:45,399 --> 00:22:46,700
Oh, it's all over everything. 

343
00:22:50,337 --> 00:22:51,605
Why? Why me? 

344
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:55,542
Because you took 300 bottles of shampoo?

345
00:22:58,145 --> 00:22:59,947
I'm sorry. You were saying?

346
00:23:00,981 --> 00:23:03,317
Okay, look it's about me and...

347
00:23:04,117 --> 00:23:05,552
Oh, not another one! 

348
00:23:07,621 --> 00:23:11,925
And this is moisturiser. It's even harder to clean! 

349
00:23:14,194 --> 00:23:17,164
Why do bad things happen to good people?

350
00:23:20,634 --> 00:23:23,370
- Clearly this is not a good time.
- You think? 

351
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:31,912
Alright, so Mike's on his way over. 

352
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:36,350
You thought you guys were meeting here, and he thought you were meeting at the restaurant, 

353
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:41,622
Doesn't really matter who's right or wrong. Point is... I'm gonna take off.

354
00:23:43,557 --> 00:23:46,593
I'm not letting you leave until you tell me what's going on here. 

355
00:23:47,094 --> 00:23:48,629
Are you guys getting back together or something?

356
00:23:51,031 --> 00:23:51,765
Alright... 

357
00:23:54,701 --> 00:23:56,036
Susie, can I call you Susie?

358
00:23:57,771 --> 00:23:59,306
My name is Precious.

359
00:24:00,741 --> 00:24:02,009
Yeah, I can't say that. 

360
00:24:04,311 --> 00:24:05,546
Susie, I'm gonna be straight with you... 

361
00:24:07,748 --> 00:24:09,216
Mike and I are back together... 

362
00:24:09,817 --> 00:24:15,022
unfortunately that effectively ends your relationship with him. 

363
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:21,562
And he's very sorry about that and wishes you the best of luck in all your endeavours.

364
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:24,765
I just can't believe this... 

365
00:24:25,632 --> 00:24:26,433
Why?

366
00:24:27,301 --> 00:24:30,671
Why would he do this? I mean, what's wrong with me?

367
00:24:31,071 --> 00:24:31,572
Nothing, there's nothing wrong with you.

368
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:34,141
What the hell am I supposed to do now?

369
00:24:34,875 --> 00:24:36,944
Damn it woman, pull yourself together! 

370
00:24:37,978 --> 00:24:40,280
Have some pride, for the love of God.

371
00:24:45,486 --> 00:24:47,521
Okay, not a fan of the tough love.

372
00:24:49,056 --> 00:24:50,290
I just can't believe 

373
00:24:50,657 --> 00:24:52,392
that Mike didn't give me any warning.

374
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:57,965
But he didn't really know. He wasn't planning on coming to Barbados and proposing to me...

375
00:24:58,398 --> 00:24:59,466
He proposed to you? 

376
00:25:00,567 --> 00:25:02,970
This is the worst birthday ever. 

377
00:25:07,474 --> 00:25:08,308
Look, 

378
00:25:08,942 --> 00:25:09,843
Precious... 

379
00:25:12,846 --> 00:25:16,583
Mike's not worth this. You're an attractive, intelligent woman 

380
00:25:16,783 --> 00:25:18,819
and let's face it, Mike's kind of a wang. 

381
00:25:20,587 --> 00:25:23,056
He proposed to me while he was still seeing you... 

382
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:25,792
He was gonna break-up with you on your birthday? 

383
00:25:26,693 --> 00:25:30,797
I don't like to kiss-and-tell, but he cheated on you a lot this weekend.

384
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:34,601
Oh, my God, maybe you're right. Maybe I don't need him. 

385
00:25:35,202 --> 00:25:36,904
I deserve to be treated with respect.

386
00:25:38,572 --> 00:25:40,174
Screw you, Mike. 

387
00:25:40,374 --> 00:25:43,544
You're a coward and a bastard, and I hope you rot in hell. 

388
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:50,651
You're welcome!

389
00:25:57,024 --> 00:25:59,493
Honey, you've been in there for a long time... Is everything okay?

390
00:26:01,028 --> 00:26:01,862
Not really. 

391
00:26:05,299 --> 00:26:06,166
I have a problem.

392
00:26:08,101 --> 00:26:10,270
Really? What happened?

393
00:26:11,705 --> 00:26:15,776
I was dancing around, and singing "No Woman, No Cry" 

394
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:19,480
and I got stuck.

395
00:26:21,548 --> 00:26:22,282
You can't move at all?

396
00:26:23,116 --> 00:26:24,017
Oh, well, I can move... 

397
00:26:31,291 --> 00:26:33,560
If I untangle you, will you please get rid of the corn rose?

398
00:26:34,294 --> 00:26:35,062
I guess so...

399
00:26:37,598 --> 00:26:38,966
Some of these look a little frayed.

400
00:26:39,833 --> 00:26:41,635
Yeah, I tried to gnaw myself free.

401
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:49,743
So, did you tell Ross?

402
00:26:50,177 --> 00:26:53,780
I tried, but then he had a shampoo related emergency. 

403
00:26:54,948 --> 00:26:56,950
So I guess now it's your turn again.

404
00:26:58,252 --> 00:26:59,620
No... I think it's better if you tell him.

405
00:27:00,087 --> 00:27:01,588
It's easier for a woman. 

406
00:27:02,055 --> 00:27:04,158
That way, if he gets mad, all you have to do is go... 

407
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:06,260
"I didn't mean it."

408
00:27:08,061 --> 00:27:10,330
"I'm so sorry."

409
00:27:14,601 --> 00:27:16,770
Yeah, 'cause that's what we do.

410
00:27:17,704 --> 00:27:20,307
How about this? Tomorrow... 

411
00:27:22,309 --> 00:27:24,745
tomorrow we'll both go and we'll tell him together.

412
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,181
Okay, that sounds fair. 

413
00:27:28,015 --> 00:27:30,017
It just means that once again we can't...

414
00:27:30,184 --> 00:27:31,018
I know, I know... but that's okay. 

415
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:34,655
We can control ourselves, we're not animals.

416
00:27:36,423 --> 00:27:37,357
Of course we can wait. 

417
00:27:38,659 --> 00:27:41,461
Alright, so I guess that means good night then?

418
00:27:43,397 --> 00:27:43,931
Good night! 

419
00:27:52,039 --> 00:27:52,806
Good night! 

420
00:27:54,475 --> 00:27:55,409
Good night.

421
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:04,718
- Seriously, good night!
- Stop saying good night.

422
00:28:25,806 --> 00:28:28,709
I'm so sorry.

423
00:28:35,549 --> 00:28:36,617
Look what I found in the drawer... 

424
00:28:39,553 --> 00:28:41,655
And you said I'd never wear this...

425
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:44,892
Now that I untangled you, 

426
00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:46,927
how 'bout you doing a little something for me?

427
00:28:47,561 --> 00:28:48,796
Sure, what do you have in mind?

428
00:28:49,963 --> 00:28:50,831
I think you know.

429
00:28:51,532 --> 00:28:53,467
Really? I don't really feel like it.

430
00:28:54,168 --> 00:28:55,636
This is what I want to do.

431
00:28:57,771 --> 00:28:58,605
Okay.

432
00:28:59,573 --> 00:29:00,941
I just don't get why you like it so much.

433
00:29:02,943 --> 00:29:06,313
She's an FBI agent, posing as a beauty contestant.
