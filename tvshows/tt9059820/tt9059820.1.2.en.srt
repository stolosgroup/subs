1
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,856
I saw you in the hospital.

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,856
If you need another lassie to carry
a baby for you, that can be me.

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,816
Are you joking? Using an 18-year-
old fresh out of a children's home?

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,496
Jesus, Emily, come on!

5
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,136
This is something I want to do.

6
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,936
Darling, this lassie
has keyed in to you,

7
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,896
and you're not thinking straight.

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,456
That's us drawing a line.

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,696
I take this and you get to prove
to Emily that I'm no good.

10
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,736
CAMERA CLICKS What's your name?

11
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,840
Kian. Kian Dodds.

12
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:33,016
I said no, Emily. Well, I'm doing
it. No, you're not. I'm doing it.

13
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,216
Emily, you're not listening!
With or without you!

14
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,456
I could phone the papers
on that guy any day.

15
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,438
On you go, then. Let's see
what happens when you do.

get whatever you want.

18
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,976
I'm OK.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,016
I've had, like, everything
on that side and most of that side,

20
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,840
as well. It's all good.

21
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,536
Er, can you get him a coffee?

22
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,056
No, thanks.

23
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,400
I'll come back.

24
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,456
You're still raging, man.
LAUGHS

25
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,536
I cannae believe
you're still raging!

26
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:31,200
Ah-ah-ah-ah!
Stay. Stay.

27
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:45,600
First, I couldnae stop boaking.
Now I cannae stop eating.

28
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,056
And what have you been
doing with yourself?

29
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,376
What do you think
I've been doing with myself?

30
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,240
Healing this family.

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,760
Well, get a rug!

32
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:11,776
Can you just...? Can you not
tidy up after her?

33
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,656
Oh, Dan! She's a teenager.

34
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,560
Where is she, anyway?

35
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,240
What have you told them?

36
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,960
We need to know!

37
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,496
You're still in shite
for all this, aren't you?

38
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,640
It's my job. I just
want to know what they know.

39
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,720
You so badly wanted
for this to fail.

40
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,696
But nae luck.

41
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,360
This is the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

42
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,056
Kaya's loving it,
living the high life.

43
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,896
New money, new clothes.

44
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,800
Well, what's she told them?
Squat.

45
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,256
Well, surely we owe them
a duty of care, the couple.

46
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,920
You're joking? We owe them nothing.
Daddy Warbucks is on his own.

47
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,776
Two bacon rolls and two coffees.

48
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,680
Hiya, Rosie. Hello.

49
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,480
Thanks, Dan.

50
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,176
What about the lassie?

51
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,096
All good in the 'hood.

52
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,016
No sign of a birth certificate?

53
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:26,256
What can I tell you? She's been in
care. I don't know the half of it.

54
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,776
Aye, but it might just suggest
she's got a criminal history

55
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,856
and she's got somebody
to scrub her clean.

56
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,736
Are you mad? She doesnae have
those kinds of connections.

57
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,136
She's a teenage idiot.

58
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,216
Look, we flew into this with
unseemly haste, I'll gie you that,

59
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:44,280
but babies get made
in more unusual circumstances.

60
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,856
Anyway,

61
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:50,600
she's three month gone.
Cannae unring a bell.

62
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:31,256
200 luxury flats, social housing,
retail, leisure,

64
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,176
No' bad for a couple
of local boys, eh?

65
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,936
Look, I know you've got
reservations, but this is it, man.

66
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,440
This is the big one.

67
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,936
You ready for tomorrow?

68
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,936
Tomorrow? What?

69
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,616
The public consultation!

70
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:51,200
I'm messing with you!
Of course I am. Bastard!

71
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,120
Kaya!

72
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:41,856

Kale, lentils, lean beef.

73
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,776
We need to build you up again now
that you're not being sick any more.

74
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,840
Do you know what? I'm actually
knackered. I might just go to bed.

KAYA LAUGHS

81
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:33,496
What can I get you? Two Jack
and cokes and one just coke.

82
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,376
How come you're not drinking?

83
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:39,240
I had a massive one last night.
I cannae smell it or I'll boak.

84
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,056
Och, I'll get them.
No, no, it's cool.

85
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,896
Whoo!

86
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,440

91
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,896
Manky bitch. Sorry.

92
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,360
THEY LAUGH

93
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,696
We should swap numbers.

94
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,720
Except next time, you're not paying
and I'm not boaking.

95
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:46,496
That's my wee boy.
Cyrus, he's called.

96
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,536
Havnae been out since he was born.
Can you tell?

97
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,040
THEY CHUCKLE

98
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,520
Cheers.

99
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,000
I've actually got one
on the go, an' all.

100
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:08,736
You do not! Mm-hm!
Is that why you're no' drinking?

101
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:12,320
I cannae believe I've met
another mum! That's meant to be.

102
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:18,336
You know what? I didnae
expect it this young.

103
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,520
But it's brilliant. Don't let anyone
tell you otherwise.

104
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:27,376
And I'm still going to college,
I'm working part time at McDonald's.

105
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,080
It's mad, but...

106
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,016
So, do you know what you're having?

107
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,600
Naw, naw.

108
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,016
It's... not actually mine.

109
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,560
How do you mean?

110
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:45,136
I'm... carrying it for this
pure minted couple who can't have

111
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,056
any of their own, so...

112
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:50,296
It's not my genes. It's, like,
nothing to do with me.

113
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,896
Serious?

114
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,216
Aye.

115
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,656
It's a piece of piss.
Six more months and done.

116
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,536
That's me set up for life.

117
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:00,120
Y'know, fuck McDonald's.
You should do it!

118
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,976
Naw.

119
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,440
I couldnae do that.

120
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,400
Gie my baby away?

121
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,400
Right. I better go.

122
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,736
What, are you... not coming back in?

123
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,960
Nah. I'm up early in the morning.
Thanks for all the drinks, though.

124
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,496
Can I get another?

125
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,656
And another. And another.

126
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,320
Another!

00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,416
I need some bread.

131
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:11,200
Emily made you a whole fucking meal
you didnae touch!

132
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,896
How much have you had to drink?

133
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,976
Look at me when I'm speaking to you!

134
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,136
How much have you drunk?

135
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,936
You don't give a fuck, do you?

Don't you touch me!
Don't you ever dare touch me!

You don't know nothing
about me or my life.

138
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,520
You come near me again,
I will fucking kill you.

139

What's going on?

140
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,776
What have you done?
What have I done? What have I done?!

141
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,536
Look at the state of her!
Have you taken something?

142
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,616
Kaya, if you've taken drugs
or anything like that,

143
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,320
you need to tell me. She's drunk.
It's no' drugs, Emily.

144
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,056
Let her go!

145
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,400
Let her fucking go.
Kaya!

146
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,296
Kaya, be careful. Kaya, slow down.

SHE YELLS

148
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,400
SHE SOBS AND SCREAMS

149
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:28,280
SHE SPEAKS IN CANTONESE

150
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,856
OK. Love you. Bye-bye.

151
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,520
That's impressive.
I didnae know you spoke Klingon.

152
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,696
Cantonese. Just to my grandparents.

153
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,176
I know. I was just making a wee
joke. Is it Eriskay you're from?

154
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:54,376
Further north. Lewis.
Born and bred on the island.

155
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:58,136
Well, hats off to you. You've come
a long way fae there to get here.

Can I get a cheese and egg roll
and a coffee?

157
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,880
Get your own bloody roll!

158
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:06,256
Y'see what I have to
put up with in here?

159
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,856
A body was recovered
from the Clyde yesterday.

160
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,336
Well, it's looking like
another drugs theft,

161
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,496
which would be the 100th
this year. Uh-huh.

162
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:17,256
So I thought we could do
something bigger,

163
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:20,120
maybe do a profile on the guy
so he's not just a number.

164
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,656
It's nae news that there's
a drugs problem, sadly.

165
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:27,096
I think what people need right now
is a bit of good news.

166
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,696
So I tell you what you can dae.

167
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:33,176
Can you get yourself down
to the City Chambers, ten o'clock?

168
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,016
Public meeting.

169
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,936
Dan Docherty, setting out his vision
for turning the arse end of Glasgow

170
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,120
into the jewel on the Clyde.

171
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,040
Kaya McDermott?

172
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,080
Are you Mum and Dad?

173
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,240
No. It's a surrogacy.

174
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,336
OK. How can I help you?

175
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,936
We were booked in for the first
scan, the three-month, next week,

176
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,416
but something's gone on in the
meantime. We just need to know.

177
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,976
We need to check...

178
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,376
Sorry.

179
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,080
What effect alcohol
might have had on the foetus.

180
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:47,896
That depends on how much
and how often.

181
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,416
Once.

182
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,856
Is there any kind of test you can do
to check if the baby's OK?

183
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:57,200
We can pay privately for an extra
ultrasound or whatever it is.

184
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:02,576
What I would say is that stress
is at least as great a risk factor.

185
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,240
HE SCOFFS

186
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,360
If you wouldn't mind,
I'd like to talk to Kaya alone.

187
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:30,216
How did you get yourself into this?

188
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,376
There seems to be tension
with the husband.

189
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,656
He's a cock.
And what about the wife?

190
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,696
I was really sick in the beginning,

191
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,936
so she jacked in her work
to look after me.

192
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:43,336
But now I'm fine and she's still
hovering about me, phoning me,

193
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,296
like, 50 times a day.
I cannae stand it!

194
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,600
It's more like the jail
than the jail.

195
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,096
And have you changed your mind
about carrying the baby?

196
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,816
Well, what if I have?

197
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,120
What am I going to do about it?

198
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,496
Yes, I'd like to talk
to Safeguarding about a patient.

199
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,000
She's 18, and it's a surrogacy.

200
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,176
I'm going to be late.
I've got to go.

201
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,536
Who's that?

202
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:01,896
Cavan. Works at the club.

203
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,680
One of the bouncers.

204
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:09,960
I'm no' leaving you alone with
a lassie who just pulled a knife.

205
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,760
Fuck's sake!

206
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,240
PHONE RINGS

207
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,520
Hang on a wee minute, pal.

208
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,200
Hello.
Hi.

209
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:00,096
All OK with you?
LOUD RAP MUSIC

210
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,336
Can you shut that off, please?

211
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,376
MUSIC VOLUME DOWN

212
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,040
Kaya? All OK?

213
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,800
Yeah.

214
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:14,520
That boy who lived
next door to me...

215
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,960
he...

216
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,920
he died.

217
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,816
Were you pals?

218
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,776
Not really, but...

219
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,880
He wanted to be a chef,
and stuff, so...

220
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,120
It's a shame.

221
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,080
See you Thursday.

222
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,416
All OK?

223
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,296
Yeah.

224
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,360
Can you turn that off, please?

225
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,840
Where the hell is he?

226
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,936
SHE SIGHS

227
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,656
You don't speak to me
for three months

228
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,616
and then you turn up at my work.

229
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,920
I need you to get
her social services files.

230
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,880
Presumably you can get hold of
this stuff through work.

231
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,640
It's my fault.

232
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,680
I didn't do nearly enough
due diligence.

233
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:54,416
It's all about
damage limitation now.

234
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,936
I just need to know
what I'm dealing with.

235
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,696
What are you doing? Hilary!

236
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:02,496
I told you what I thought
about this. Don't make a scene.

237
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,456
SCOFFS
I've got nothing to be ashamed of!

238
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,336
You know, people say to me,
"Oh, you're Dan Docherty's sister.

239
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:11,056
"Hasn't he done so well?"
Jesus! And I always say the same.

240
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:14,296
"Well, he hasn't changed. He loves
Celtic, he loves his family."

241
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,896
"He likes what he likes.
He won't change."

242
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,936
I didn't know you already had.
Completely.

243
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:22,216
I'm not having this conversation!
Close the door.

244
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,320
"Due diligence", Dan?

245
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,736
She is a human being.
She doesn't come with a warranty.

246
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,216
Excuse me.

247
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,560
Excuse me!

248
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,416
It's exploitation, pure and simple,

249
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,960
and I'm having
nothing to do with it.

250
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,576
Where the hell have you been?

251
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,800
I'm here. It's fine.

252
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,856
What's the problem?!

253
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,640
Let's go.

254
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,440
CHATTER

255
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,680
Apologies.

256
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,640
DAN CLEARS HIS THROAT

257
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,520
What does anyone want?

258
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,016
More than what their parents had.

259
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:25,600
SHE SIGHS
More choices, more opportunities.

260
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,096
A safe and secure future
for their family.

261
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,496
Aye, for those who can afford it.

262
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,200
MURMURING

263
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,016
Y'know,

264
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:41,240
I'm no' some chancer
up here from London.

265
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,096
I'm an East End boy myself.

266
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,416
Probably spent as much time
down the Barras as you have.

267
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,336
But if I've learned anything

268
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,936
it's that you cannae
stop progress.

269
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:55,136
You cannae be nostalgic.
You cannae hang on to the old ways

270
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,176
if they're not fit for purpose.

271
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,800
It's supply and demand,
at the end of the day.

272
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,320
What... motivates me...

273
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,880
is creating opportunities
for young people.

274
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,336
We're already the biggest employer

275
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,256
of under-25s
in the west of Scotland,

276
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:19,616
and this development
will create 2,000 more jobs.

277
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,136
What kind of "opportunities"
for young people?

278
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,456
MURMURING

279
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:26,256
I'll take questions at the end.
See, your "man of the people" chat,

280
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,416
it cannae disguise
what you're really up to.

281
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:32,336
Folk on zero-hour contracts
have made you a multimillionaire.

282
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,856
That's no' opportunity.

283
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,136
It's exploitation.

284
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,880
CAMERAS CLICK

285
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,976
And what do you do? Eh?

286
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,736
How do you improve the lives
of the people of this city?

287
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:45,976
I'm a social worker.

288
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,800
LAUGHTER

289
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,736
Well, if you're sucking
at the public teat,

290
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,536
no wonder you know
nothing about business.

291
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:55,400
SHOCKED GASPS Jesus Christ!

292
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,600
The Docherty Group...

293
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:04,216
we want to be right at
the forefront of ushering in a new

294
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:08,496
era for Glasgow. We want
to build a new East End.

295
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:11,456
What was that?! It was fine.
I pulled it back.

296
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,856
No, you never! It was a PR disaster.

297
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:17,336
Now I'm gonnae have to trail round
after ye with a dustpan and brush.

298
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,840
Son, what the hell's
up with you the day?

299
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,896
What you doing out here?
You're supposed to be in there!

300
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:45,536
I'm really sorry, Mr Docherty.
I don't think it's going to work.

301
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:48,040
Mrs Docherty, she doesn't
want me in the house.

302
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,480
Emily?

303
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,800
Emily!
I'm here!

304
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,136
I need to eat.

305
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,976
Of course. You don't
have to ask. She wasn't.

306
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,176
Here, look,
I can make you something.

307
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,896
You go and sit down. You need
to rest. I'll get you something.

308
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,536
Something healthy...

309
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:14,096
Emily! Stop, Emily!

310
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,576
Stop flapping about her!

311
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,696
Look, we've got six months
left to run on this thing, OK?

312
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:22,336
So what's going to
make it better for you? Eh?

313
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,816
What's going to stop you from
pulling any of that shite again?

314
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:27,080
Well...
No! Let her speak.

315
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,640
I need out.

316
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,200
Not out of the pregnancy,
out of the house.

317
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:47,456
It's perfect. She'll work
nine to five, nothing strenuous.

318
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,016
I'll take her in and back every day.

319
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:52,096
She just got drunk
while pregnant with our child

320
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,896
and you want to give her
a job in a bar!

321
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,296
He's not an alky, Emily.
She's a teenager and she's bored.

322
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,840
She said as much!

323
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:02,216
Look, you sold this to me that
this lassie was entrepreneurial.

324
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,720
Well, let's see it! Maybe she is.

325
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,640
What's the issue?

326
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,880
We're out the danger zone.
We're past 12 weeks.

327
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,136
She could still change her mind.

328
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,656
Till 25 weeks.

329
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,016
She could just...

330
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,896
end it at any moment, and then...

331
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:28,840
that's it, Dan. No more embryos.
No more chances.

332
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:35,376
What's going to stop her, hey?

333
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:38,936
Not you standing over her breathing
down her neck. I know, but...

334
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,976
being around other young people
and working in a bar,

335
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,280
she's not going to
want this, is she?

336
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,016
Maybe.

337
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:51,800
Maybe not. But she's got
all the cards here, darling.

338
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,936
She's got all the power.

339
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,560
That's what we've given her
with this arrangement.

340
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,616
We've no choice but to trust her.

341
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,160
SHE SIGHS

342
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,040
John Joe!

343
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,480
How you doing, pal?

344
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,416
This is Kaya. Friend of the family.

345
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,296
I want you to put her in the team.

346
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,696
Nothing too strenuous.

347
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,720
Not a problem. I'll...
have a wee look at the rota now.

348
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,400
You know what? Let's put her
front of house, nine to five.

349
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,960
Just move that lassie
into another section.

350
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:21,256
Are you raging?
I screwed up your rota?

351
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,976
No... Not at all.
It's... no problem.

352
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,600
I'll have a wee look at it now.
Good man.

353
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:57,736
Did I no' ask you to write up that
meeting I sent you to yesterday?

354
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,776
You did.

355
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,320
Then how come you're still
snuffling about this guy?

356
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:06,256
Because there's a connection.

357
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,496
Look.

358
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,416
Well, what am I looking at?

359
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,536
Dan Docherty
on Kian Dodd's Instagram,

360
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,696
visiting his flats.

361
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,656
The guy was obviously
a disaffected employee.

362
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:20,576
Nope. That's not the connection.

363
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,656
I called Docherty Developments
to check.

364
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,880
They say they've never employed him.

365
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,856
Er, have you booked?

366
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,816
Er, no. That's why we came at 12.

367
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,136
Well, I don't know
what you want me to tell you.

368
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,896
It's red, red, red, red, red.

369
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,896
Hello!

370
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:51,016
Come on through.

371
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,560
Thank you.

372
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,240
Fuckin' hell.

373
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,976
Oh, my God! You're back!

374
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,520
Awww!

375
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,616
Come to save me from marking!

376
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,056
And the diddly-dees.

377
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,096
And the what?
The diddly-dees!

378
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,696
The traditional Scottish music
people.

379
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:24,056
My only mates
since you quit the scene.

380
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,720
SHE LAUGHS

381
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,536
So, what's the story?

382
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:32,176
I thought you weren't coming back
till after the baby.

383
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,656
SIGHS I wasn't.

384
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,136
It's Kaya.

385
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,536
What's she done now?

386
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:40,240
Oh, no. It's me, actually.

387
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,496
I think I'm doing her head in.

388
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,816
SHE LAUGHS

389
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,536
What?!

390
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,416
I don't doubt it.

391
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,240
EMILY LAUGHS

392
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,736
Kaya?

393
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,160
John Joe says put these in the lane.

394
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,600

Hey!

BOTTLE SMASHES

396
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,976
Hey.
Hi! Hi. How was it?

397
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,136
Couldn't get a word out of her
in the car, so I haven't got a clue.

398
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:41,200
Well... Well, was it OK?
Are you going to go back?

Oh.

DOOR CLOSES

403
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:10,400
Don't take me to the door.
Just let me out here.

404
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,216
Hey!

405
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,776
Hey, I know who you are.

406
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,136
I saw you getting in Dan's car,
so you must be...

407
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:37,256
I'm Jack.
I'm Dan and Emily's nephew.

408
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,776
Look, I hear you had a shocker
yesterday. Gina told me.

409
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,136
She's my girlfriend.
She's first-year uni.

410
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:45,176
Look, I think it's cool,
what you're doing, and so does she.

411
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,816
But we're not going to tell anyone.

412
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:49,176
Well, people should do
whatever they want, but

413
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,240
I'm a feminist. I think
what you're doing is awesome.

414
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,376
This red section up here
is booked, which you should...

415
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,856
Oh. Morning, guys. You all right?

416
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:02,416
Er, which you should...
You know that already. Yeah.

417
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:05,896
And then this section here
is, like, referencing back,

418
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,136
and then this blue section
is the unreserved section.

419
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,656
Morning, mate.
Morning!

420
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:13,416
Do you understand? Yeah.
Great. Now you have a go.

421
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,400
OK. Erm...

422
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,296
So...

423
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,200
Erm, control-C.

424
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,456
And move that up here...

425
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,456
Control-A.

426
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,960
Yeah. Great job.

427
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:31,176
Gina's not here today.

428
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,336
She's got lectures,
cos she's first-year uni, so...

429
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,016
You already told me that.

430
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,136
You're quite impressed
with that, aye?

431
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,776
Well, I'm still at school, so...

432
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,256
Well, why are you here, then?
Oh, it's half-term.

433
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,600
But I'm usually working
on Thursday nights and Saturdays.

434
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:52,576
You know, she's really nice, Gina.
She told me that you two

435
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,896
were sparking off each other
the other day.

436
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:57,816
But, I mean, I suppose that's how
girls always become friends.

437
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:01,160
Like, they love telling you that "we
hated each other when we first met"!

438
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,936
Are you straight?

439
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,416
Yeah.

440
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,256
You don't seem it. No offence.

441
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,960
None taken. I'll see you later.

442
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:24,136
So, it's dinner at eight
with a bunch of journalists.

443
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:27,856
And I've been trying to spray away
the stink you left at that meeting.

444
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:31,096
Christ, you come in in a state,
you answered in a state.

445
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:34,576
You were emotional, you were
defensive. I'll sort it. Aye.

What else?
SOUTER SIGHS

447

Gregor?
No. Somebody else.

449
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,136
They're asking if a Kian Dodds
ever worked for us,

450
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:52,120
and if he hasn't,
how you might know him.

451
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,560
I don't. Who is he?

452
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:00,560
He's nobody now.
He's been fished out the Clyde.

453
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,560
The thing is, Dan...

454
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,400
he lived next door to Kaya.

455
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,016
Speak, son!

456
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:20,456
Before there's nae time left
to dae anything about this.

457
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,040
Never met him.

No.

We're not going to

I don't. Gina doesn't.

Look, I'll call Dan.
No. Don't.

Wait.

475
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:45,576
Oh, I just forgot me earplugs.
Earplugs? Yeah.

476
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:49,016
I play piano and violin, so I need
to be careful with my hearing.

477
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:52,656
I'm going to Cambridge
to study music. Hopefully!

478
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:55,080
Am I shouting?
No.

479
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,816
Are you thinking about studying?

480
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:00,496
Aye. Oxford won't take no
for an answer.

So, what are you into?
How do you mean?

I swim every day. Look, smell me.

That wee Chinese lassie?

Cannae tell. It was on the phone.

I told her no' to bother with it!

You're making me nervous!

Look, if this mad thing
hasn't gone tits up by this point,

501
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,456
then it's probably going to be OK.

EMILY LAUGHS

00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:28,376
I don't know how she feels.
I think that's been the problem.

507
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,856
Every day, I've been giving it the
whole, "It's the size of an almond."

508
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,936
"Now it's the size
of a passion fruit."

509
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:36,856
"Now it's the size of a... lemon."

510
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,216
I think the more I've been trying
to bond with the baby,

511
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:41,840
the more annoying
I've become to her.

512
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:46,136
God, I've been so annoying!

513

00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,736

00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,440
But it didn't.

518
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,456
No.

519
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,840
It didn't.

to give you a fright.

You know, I... I...

527
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:36,056
I think I had this... fantasy...

528
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:40,480
that we were going to
help each other. But...

529
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:44,536
I haven't helped you at all.

530
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,080
I've treated you like a...

531
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,760
battery hen, and...

532
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,240
I'm so sorry.

533
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,440
This, erm...

534
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,880
this thing happened.

535
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,720
I lost someone.

536
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:10,176
And I think I struggle
sometimes to

537
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,600
believe that good things
can happen...

538
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,800
things can be OK.

539
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,936
But...

540
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,840
the past is not the present.

541
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,680
How come you can't
have your own kids?

542
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:34,960
What's actually wrong?
I never asked you that.

543
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,160
It just doesn't happen.

544
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,176
I don't have

545
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,920
good-quality eggs.

546
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,280
I don't know why.

547
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:50,056
And even the ones they could
harvest,

548
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:52,360
I could never carry to term, so...

549
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,840
"Unexplained infertility."

550
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,040
But, erm...

551
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,616
how are you? Are you... OK?

552
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:12,656

00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:25,640

What about that for a name?

584
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:30,280
Rex? That's a dug's name.

585
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:33,496
How do you know it's a boy, anyway?

586
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,960
I don't. You'd know better than me.

587
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,216
What about Kathy?

588

Rank.

589
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,200
That was my mum's name.

590
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:48,016
Where is she, your mum?

591
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:50,136
Ah, she's long gone.

592
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,336
Died when I was 13.

593
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:54,320
Who looked after you?

594
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:56,496
Hilary,

595
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:58,336
my sister.

596
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:01,440
She was 16 at the time, so we
kind of looked after each other.

597
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:06,216
I went a bit mental
for a couple of years,

598
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,096
then I got stuck into work,
you know?

599
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:09,840
Is there a wee lesson in there?

600
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:14,800
Hey, what about Neve?

601
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:20,960
What? If it's a girl.
It's Irish. Neve.

602
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,416
No' bad.

603
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:26,896
But no use, since
it's going to be a boy.

604
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:30,056
Right, it's Baltic out here.
Want to go get a roll?

605
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:33,136

00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:37,320
Aye. Course it is.

608
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:42,136
Sammy, will you go and finish
your breakfast, please?

609
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,376
OK. Mum, have you seen
my school shirt?

610
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,800
It's ironed and in your cupboard.
It's not.

Why is she texting you?

617
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:14,576
We're friends. Since when? Since
she started working at Dan's bar.

618
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:17,336
I-I don't want you
involved with her.

619
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:18,736
You're such a hypocrite!

620
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:21,136
Well, why don't you carry on
letting Dan pay our school fees

621
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:24,096
while otherwise shitting
on everything else that he does?

622
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:25,616
Don't speak to your mum like that.

623
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:28,296
What's so wrong with this girl that
we've let it fuck up our family?

624
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:30,936
That's enough! You don't know
anything about her. You've judged

625
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:32,920
someone you've never even met!

626
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:37,240
You fancy her. Get lost.
What are you talking about? You do!

627
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:48,496
This isnae Nancy Drew. We're
a respected national newspaper.

628
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:51,296
You cannae just pick up the phone
and poke about willy-nilly.

629
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:54,616
It wasn't willy-nilly. I was trying
to speak to Dan Docherty.

630
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:58,456
No, you cannae.
You need to build relationships,

631
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:00,576
not just sources.
That's how it works.

632
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:02,616
Okey dokey?

633
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:03,880
Right on.

634
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:21,720
Excuse me?

635
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:25,720
Excuse me?

636
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:29,536
Excuse me, is Dan Docherty in?

637
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:31,416
If you want to get a hold
of Mr Docherty,

638
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,456
you'll need to make an appointment.

639
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:36,616
Does he come down here? Well, yes,
but he's not here at the moment.

640
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:39,016
But do you know where else
I might be able to find him, or...?

641
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:40,560
I'm sorry, I'm really busy.

642

00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:08,656
I'm new to Glasgow, actually.

645
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:11,536
I'm from Lewis.

646
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:14,536
Where's that?
The arse end of nowhere.

647
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:17,056
Couldn't wait to leave.

648
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:19,080
One sec.

649
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:23,696
Er, there's a table of six up there.

650
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:26,656
Could you go and grab those glasses
for me? Yeah, no problem. Thanks.

00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,720
Shit!

654
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:45,040
Shit. Someone's nicked my bag.

655
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:47,760
Someone's nicked my bag!

Oh, I've missed you!

660
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:12,360
What's wrong?

661
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:14,680
Can I stay?

Is Mum ever coming back
to live with us?

669
00:50:57,560 --> 00:51:00,656
If she gets better, then yeah!

670
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:02,936
Do you think she'll get better?

671
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:05,600
I don't know, darling.
That's up to her.

672

676
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:40,720
Definitely, definitely with me.

677
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:43,760
All right? Mwah!

678

Someone's recognised me.

00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:24,280
Look, it's OK. It's OK!

686
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:30,016
We talked about this.
It's something we've prepped for.

687
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,816
Just go back.

688
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:33,936
Go back.

689
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:35,520
No-one knows anything.

690
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:39,136
She was always
a difficult child.

691
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:40,976
Secretive.

692
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,880
Yeah. Manipulative.

693
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:47,896
What's it you call it? Er...

694
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:49,520
A hair-trigger fuse.

695
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:55,136
Yeah. I don't remember a time
I didn't struggle with her.

696
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:56,856
My mum couldn't look after me.

697
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:00,616
Obviously, she couldn't be named
during the trial, and, er,

698
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:04,920
she'll have a new identity
when... when she's released.

699
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:09,896
But for those of us still living
on Lewis, it's hard.

700
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:11,776
Yeah.

701
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:13,376
It's very hard.

702
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:15,096
Death.
Sorry...

703
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:16,760
Violent death when I was 11.

704
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:19,480
What about Neve?

705
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:37,456
You come near me again,

What's she after, the journalist?

709
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:48,576
Ah, just some rubbish about
pay and conditions in the club.

710
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:50,240
It's nothing.

711
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:55,616
See you tomorrow.

712
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:57,240
See ya.

713
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:20,360

Er, Emily's just downstairs.
She says I can stay.

717
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:05,200
I can't take one more minute
of my mum.

718
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:11,216
Hey, what's wrong? Are you OK?

719
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:13,600
Aye. I'm brand-new.

720
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:23,520
She killed someone.

721
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:26,576
Knifed them.

722
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:28,000
Watched them bleed.

723
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:32,680
Lassie was pregnant.

724
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:35,056
Killed her unborn child.

725
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:36,320
Oh...

726
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:39,240
Oh!

727
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:43,960
What am I going to do, Hilary?

728
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:53,680
She's 14 weeks. We're past
the point of no return.

729
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:00,040
No, you're not.

730
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,480
There's plenty of time
before it gets to that.

731
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:10,080
How long?

732
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:17,520
A good ten weeks.

733
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:21,880
What am I going to do?

734
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:27,720
It's going to be OK.

735
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:42,720
Shit. I'm so sorry.
I didn't even ask if that was OK.

736
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:51,016
Oh! I'm so pleased
you two know each other.

737
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:53,840
Right! What are we watching?

738
00:57:56,640 --> 00:58:01,200
Listen to me. You have got choices
and you've got time.

739
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:11,720
It's going to be OK.
