1
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:09,487
Last season on
Star Trek: Discovery...

2
00:00:09,531 --> 00:00:11,489
700 years after we left,

3
00:00:11,533 --> 00:00:13,491
dilithium supplies dried up.

4
00:00:13,535 --> 00:00:15,798
The Federation tried
alternative warp drive designs,

5
00:00:15,841 --> 00:00:17,887
but none proved reliable.
Then came the Burn.

6
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:20,977
No one knows how
or why it happened,

7
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:23,936
but in an instant,
all dilithium went inert.

8
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:26,330
Any ship with an active
warp core detonated.

9
00:00:26,374 --> 00:00:29,333
The Federation as we know it
disappeared overnight.

10
00:00:29,377 --> 00:00:31,596
This is where the Burn started.

11
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,295
I'm reading that there is
dilithium dispersed throughout

12
00:00:34,338 --> 00:00:35,992
this entire planet.

13
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,342
Federation could use that kind
of news right about now.

14
00:00:38,386 --> 00:00:41,084
There's a signal coming
from the center of the nebula.

15
00:00:41,128 --> 00:00:43,130
The message is over
100 years old.

16
00:00:43,173 --> 00:00:46,263
This is Dr. Issa
of the KSFKh'ieth.

17
00:00:46,307 --> 00:00:50,093
Those spots on Dr. Issa's head.
she was pregnant.

18
00:00:51,312 --> 00:00:53,140
We have come
to rescue the child.

19
00:00:53,183 --> 00:00:55,751
Su'kal. That is his name.

20
00:00:58,754 --> 00:01:01,365
I think we may have just found
the source of the Burn.

21
00:01:01,409 --> 00:01:03,759
You are no longer alone.

22
00:01:03,802 --> 00:01:05,239
Saru has asked for time

23
00:01:05,282 --> 00:01:06,240
to consider his next steps.

24
00:01:06,283 --> 00:01:09,112
He'll return to Kaminar

25
00:01:09,156 --> 00:01:11,201
to help Su'kal build a new life.

26
00:01:11,245 --> 00:01:12,942
This is home now.

27
00:01:12,985 --> 00:01:14,291
No, Kwejian is home.

28
00:01:14,335 --> 00:01:16,467
I really liked seeing Kwejian.

29
00:01:16,511 --> 00:01:18,513
I really liked
being there with you.

30
00:01:18,556 --> 00:01:19,731
Have you spoken with Saru?

31
00:01:19,775 --> 00:01:21,820
Yes, sir, I have, but...

32
00:01:21,864 --> 00:01:24,388
He wants you to captain Discovery.
I do, too.

33
00:01:24,432 --> 00:01:27,391
So many worlds have been
struggling since the Burn.

34
00:01:27,435 --> 00:01:30,394
You found a way to mine
that dilithium on that planet.

35
00:01:30,438 --> 00:01:32,396
You and your crew
can bring it to them.

36
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,833
You can bring them hope,
Commander Burnham.

37
00:01:34,877 --> 00:01:39,055
They have waited long enough,
and I think so have you.

38
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:40,970
Everybody ready?

39
00:01:41,013 --> 00:01:42,885
Yes, Captain.

40
00:01:42,928 --> 00:01:44,974
Let's fly.

It is an honor

your planet has received
since the Burn.

On behalf of the
United Federation of Planets,

46
00:02:47,906 --> 00:02:49,473
we thank you.

47
00:02:49,517 --> 00:02:51,693
We've been sent
to convey their desire

48
00:02:51,736 --> 00:02:54,565
to reconnect with
your great civilization,

49
00:02:54,609 --> 00:02:57,220
and to raise the possibility
of sharing resources

50
00:02:57,264 --> 00:02:59,222
and technology in the future.

51
00:02:59,266 --> 00:03:04,096
It's tradition to give a gift as
a means of establishing trust,

52
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,142
so, as gesture of goodwill,

53
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,231
we've brought dilithium
on our ship,

54
00:03:08,275 --> 00:03:10,277
and we'd be pleased
to offer it to you,

55
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,801
as we've done
with many other worlds.

56
00:03:12,844 --> 00:03:15,238
No strings attached.

57
00:03:18,241 --> 00:03:19,634
Oh, I'm sorry.

58
00:03:19,677 --> 00:03:21,244
Uh, that's an idiom,
a non-literal ex...

59
00:03:21,288 --> 00:03:23,072
We're familiar.

60
00:03:23,115 --> 00:03:25,596
Perhaps we should speak plainly,

61
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,077
forego the niceties
of politics.

62
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,731
Oh, I believe
there's been a misunderstanding.

63
00:03:29,774 --> 00:03:31,298
No misunderstanding.

64
00:03:31,341 --> 00:03:33,778
You brought something
you think we need,

65
00:03:33,822 --> 00:03:36,390
along with the tantalizing
offer to help yourselves

66
00:03:36,433 --> 00:03:38,392
to our technological bounty,

67
00:03:38,435 --> 00:03:41,830
all for the low, low price of...

68
00:03:41,873 --> 00:03:43,484
no strings attached.

69
00:03:43,527 --> 00:03:45,703
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
she said the words "possibility"

70
00:03:45,747 --> 00:03:48,663
and "share,"
but other than that...

71
00:03:48,706 --> 00:03:50,186
Book.

72
00:03:52,188 --> 00:03:56,410
I am aware that in the decades
leading up to the Burn,

73
00:03:56,453 --> 00:03:59,108
your relationship with
the Federation was strained.

74
00:03:59,151 --> 00:04:00,675
But you've changed,

75
00:04:00,718 --> 00:04:03,199
things are different now,
we can trust you.

76
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:10,598
We scanned your ship.

77
00:04:10,641 --> 00:04:13,122
You brought a third life-form
to our planet.

78
00:04:13,165 --> 00:04:16,256
Yeah, that's Grudge.
Grudge?

79
00:04:16,299 --> 00:04:18,954
Felis catus,
a domestic species

80
00:04:18,997 --> 00:04:21,739
of small carnivorous mammal.

81
00:04:21,783 --> 00:04:23,306
You claim
to understand our culture,

82
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:25,090
yet you bring a carnivore
to our world?

83
00:04:25,134 --> 00:04:27,049
Domestic. I said domestic.

84
00:04:27,092 --> 00:04:30,139
She's... my pet.
She lives on my ship.

85
00:04:30,182 --> 00:04:34,056
I feed her, love her,
give her cat treats.

86
00:04:34,099 --> 00:04:35,144
Is she grateful?

87
00:04:35,187 --> 00:04:38,147
No. No.

88
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:39,627
In no way.
It's bad attitude.

89
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:41,106
Yet you expect us to be.

90
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:43,108
No. Oh, no, no, no.

91
00:04:43,152 --> 00:04:44,762
Have you come
to make pets of us?
We haven't come

92
00:04:44,806 --> 00:04:46,329
to make you anything.
You've got the wrong idea.

93
00:04:46,373 --> 00:04:47,678
D...
Let me explain.

94
00:04:47,722 --> 00:04:48,679
Uh, she's a queen.
She's a queen.

95
00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:54,163
You hold a Monarch captive?

96
00:04:54,206 --> 00:04:55,686
Oh, no. No, no, no, no.

97
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:57,253
Oh, Emperor Lee'U...
No, it is not like that.

98
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,341
...we have the utmost respect.
I don't...

99
00:04:58,385 --> 00:04:59,821
We have the utmost respect

100
00:04:59,864 --> 00:05:01,344
for-for you, for...
Absolutely. For sure.

101
00:05:04,521 --> 00:05:07,002
This is bad. This is really bad.

102
00:05:07,045 --> 00:05:08,351
Okay, so do your empathy thing.

103
00:05:08,395 --> 00:05:10,005
My what?
Your...

104
00:05:10,048 --> 00:05:11,659
your empathy thing,
right-right now.

105
00:05:11,702 --> 00:05:13,095
I brought you here
to connect with them.

106
00:05:13,138 --> 00:05:15,053
I don't think
they want to connect.

107
00:05:16,054 --> 00:05:18,361
You will take us to your ship.

108
00:05:18,405 --> 00:05:20,407
We will free the queen.

109
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:22,757
Oh...
Yup. Time to go.

110
00:05:31,548 --> 00:05:33,724
They're not gonna be happy
when they see

111
00:05:33,768 --> 00:05:35,291
a massive starship.
They're not going to.

112
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,858
What?
It wouldn't fit
through the trees.

113
00:05:36,901 --> 00:05:39,121
I'm sending the little guy.

114
00:05:39,164 --> 00:05:41,776
And it'll be here in time?
We're about to find out.

115
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:44,082
Oh, why is there
always a cliff?

116
00:05:49,566 --> 00:05:51,525
Why did you say "carnivore"
to the butterfly people?

117
00:05:51,568 --> 00:05:53,309
They are not butterfly people.

118
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:54,919
Why do you even have a pet?

119
00:05:54,963 --> 00:05:56,704
Why don't you just have
a hologram goldfish?

120
00:05:56,747 --> 00:05:58,488
I had one. Grudge ate it.

121
00:05:58,532 --> 00:06:00,751
Who eats a hologram?

122
00:06:00,795 --> 00:06:03,319
The butterflies are shooting
at us. Bring up weapons system.

123
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:06,409
No. No, do not fire back.
This is a diplomatic mission.

124
00:06:06,453 --> 00:06:07,758
Then I'm beaming us out of here.

125
00:06:07,802 --> 00:06:09,934
No, we have
to give them dilithium.

126
00:06:09,978 --> 00:06:11,719
They don't want it!

127
00:06:11,762 --> 00:06:14,286
If we leave now, they will never
trust the Federation again.

128
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:16,071
Or we'll come back
when they're in a better mood.

129
00:06:16,114 --> 00:06:17,942
Why haven't they hit us?
What?

130
00:06:17,986 --> 00:06:20,641
The Alshain. At this range,
they should have hit us by now.

131
00:06:20,684 --> 00:06:22,556
And that's a problem?
Captain,

132
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:24,775
sensors have you moving
erratically. Everything okay?

133
00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:27,343
Yup. Just negotiating.
Uh, about to hit a tree.

134
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,214
Hang on!

135
00:06:38,354 --> 00:06:40,965
"Don't fire back," she says.

136
00:06:42,445 --> 00:06:44,099
They're having trouble
navigating.

137
00:06:44,142 --> 00:06:46,188
Still able to shoot at us.

138
00:06:51,062 --> 00:06:53,108
Here.
Yeah.

139
00:06:55,502 --> 00:06:57,895
Great.
Maybe we'll live long enough

140
00:06:57,939 --> 00:06:58,896
for me to pet my hostage again.

141
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,768
That's it.

142
00:07:04,162 --> 00:07:06,687
It's their satellites.
You're not explaining, are you?

143
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:07,905
Rhys, we could use some help.

144
00:07:07,949 --> 00:07:09,341
Want me to send a team down?

145
00:07:09,385 --> 00:07:11,082
No. It's a science problem.

146
00:07:11,126 --> 00:07:13,737
Is this a chase? Are you
in the middle of a chase?

147
00:07:13,781 --> 00:07:15,478
The Alshain can't stay
on course in flight.

148
00:07:15,522 --> 00:07:17,480
I think we need to get
their satellites working again.

149
00:07:18,655 --> 00:07:20,440
Aye, Captain.
We'll figure it out.

150
00:07:20,483 --> 00:07:22,180
Uh, Commander Stamets?
Unless the Alshain

151
00:07:22,224 --> 00:07:24,052
have been hitting the
Romulan whiskey, which I doubt,

152
00:07:24,095 --> 00:07:26,968
the problem has to be...
Oh, the planet's
magnetic poles.

153
00:07:27,011 --> 00:07:28,970
They started shifting
300 years ago.

154
00:07:29,013 --> 00:07:31,059
They're now 14 degrees west
of where they'd been

155
00:07:31,102 --> 00:07:32,887
for hundreds
of thousands of years.

156
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:35,716
Alshain use the magnetic fields
to navigate during flight.

157
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,848
Like birds?
Oh, did you know birds are born

158
00:07:37,892 --> 00:07:39,937
with a mineral substance called
magnetite that helps them

159
00:07:39,981 --> 00:07:41,896
determine the magnetic field
so they can find true north?

160
00:07:41,939 --> 00:07:43,550
They'd have developed technology

161
00:07:43,593 --> 00:07:45,334
to help compensate
for the shift.

162
00:07:45,377 --> 00:07:47,684
Captain was right.
The dead satellites. They're...

163
00:07:47,728 --> 00:07:49,512
Geomagnetic compensators.

164
00:07:49,556 --> 00:07:52,254
Nice work, both of you.

165
00:07:52,297 --> 00:07:55,518
Jovar Tal loved birds. So...

166
00:07:55,562 --> 00:07:57,825
All right, team, what's up
with the compensators?

167
00:07:57,868 --> 00:07:59,479
Why aren't they working?

168
00:07:59,522 --> 00:08:01,350
They use dilithium
to stabilize the power supply.

169
00:08:01,393 --> 00:08:03,221
And I'm not getting dilithium
signatures from any of them.

170
00:08:03,265 --> 00:08:04,658
They're out of juice.
Captain Burnham?

171
00:08:04,701 --> 00:08:07,356
Got it.
Send DOTs with enough dilithium

172
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:09,010
to restart the array.

173
00:08:09,053 --> 00:08:10,707
That is a monumentally
shitty idea.

174
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:12,622
You want to make it easier
for them to catch us?

175
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:14,929
We have to earn their trust.
More Alshain coming.

176
00:08:14,972 --> 00:08:16,321
If we give you
some covering fire...

177
00:08:16,365 --> 00:08:17,801
Do not fire! We've got this!

178
00:08:17,845 --> 00:08:19,368
No, Michael, we do not.

179
00:08:38,648 --> 00:08:40,607
We're done.
I'm beaming us out.
We can't.

180
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:42,478
Not every moment is a victory.

181
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,306
Compensator re-initialized,
Captain.

182
00:08:50,573 --> 00:08:52,227
You were saying?
Congratulations.

183
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:54,795
Now they can shoot
right at us. Can we go now?

184
00:08:56,057 --> 00:08:57,928
You tell me.

185
00:09:00,888 --> 00:09:01,976
Yes.

186
00:09:19,471 --> 00:09:22,213
Yeah. Yeah.

187
00:09:33,224 --> 00:09:35,444
You're welcome.

188
00:09:55,638 --> 00:09:57,771
Captain, the emperor
is hailing us.

189
00:09:57,814 --> 00:10:00,295
Hmm. Thank you,
Lieutenant Christopher.

190
00:10:00,338 --> 00:10:02,384
Put him through.

191
00:10:04,691 --> 00:10:09,086
You did not experience a
pleasant visit, Captain Burnham.

192
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:11,436
That's one way of putting it.
Then may I inquire,

193
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,700
Why still give us
your dilithium?

194
00:10:13,743 --> 00:10:15,179
Because we're the Federation.

195
00:10:15,223 --> 00:10:17,617
It's what we do.

196
00:10:19,357 --> 00:10:21,751
And if you need anything else,
we're here.

197
00:10:23,927 --> 00:10:26,277
No strings attached.

198
00:10:34,068 --> 00:10:37,332
Well, that was
a hell of a thing.

199
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:40,683
Thanks, everyone.

200
00:10:40,727 --> 00:10:42,685
All right.

201
00:10:42,729 --> 00:10:45,122
Let's fly.

202
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:47,211
♪

203
00:11:14,761 --> 00:11:17,589
♪

204
00:11:44,921 --> 00:11:47,707
♪

205
00:12:17,258 --> 00:12:19,303
The Federation's gift

206
00:12:19,347 --> 00:12:21,784
of dilithium can take us back
to the stars.

207
00:12:21,828 --> 00:12:24,004
Or it can benefit our citizens

208
00:12:24,047 --> 00:12:25,919
in their daily lives here
on Kaminar.

209
00:12:25,962 --> 00:12:28,748
The danger
of travel is too great.

210
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:31,054
And the Burn cannot happen
again,

211
00:12:31,098 --> 00:12:34,710
now that I have left
the dilithium planet.

212
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:38,061
How can you be sure?
There is always a risk.

213
00:12:38,105 --> 00:12:40,803
We cannot live in fear.
We've waited long enough!

214
00:12:42,326 --> 00:12:44,067
We've gotten through this.

215
00:12:44,111 --> 00:12:49,377
Great Elder, you have yet
to share your own perspective.

216
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,466
We would value your words
immensely.

217
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:01,215
Su'Kal is correct.

218
00:13:01,258 --> 00:13:04,131
There is no danger
of another Burn.

219
00:13:04,174 --> 00:13:05,785
Science is clear in that regard.

220
00:13:05,828 --> 00:13:10,964
I have marveled
these five months on Kaminar.

221
00:13:11,007 --> 00:13:14,924
Past generations of our species
lived in fear

222
00:13:14,968 --> 00:13:17,144
and hatred.

223
00:13:17,187 --> 00:13:21,365
We live now, together,
in communion.

224
00:13:21,409 --> 00:13:23,846
And while at times
we may struggle,

225
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:27,894
I believe there is much we can
share with other worlds.

226
00:13:27,937 --> 00:13:31,549
Our-our duty is to our home,
is it not?

227
00:13:31,593 --> 00:13:34,596
If you define Kaminar,
alone, as "home,"

228
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,163
it is, of course.

229
00:13:36,206 --> 00:13:38,818
But consider this.

230
00:13:41,298 --> 00:13:45,607
Here, we live, love,

231
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:48,044
grow food
in the light of our sun.

232
00:13:48,088 --> 00:13:51,613
Uh, however...

233
00:13:51,656 --> 00:13:55,660
it is not... our sun.

234
00:13:55,704 --> 00:13:59,012
We share it with six other
planets in our solar system.

235
00:13:59,055 --> 00:14:02,885
A system which is one
of many in...

236
00:14:02,929 --> 00:14:05,018
a shared galaxy,

237
00:14:05,061 --> 00:14:07,281
Beyond our galaxy...

238
00:14:07,324 --> 00:14:10,501
space.

239
00:14:10,545 --> 00:14:14,418
In truth,
we are on an island together.

240
00:14:14,462 --> 00:14:18,031
We must ask ourselves,

241
00:14:18,074 --> 00:14:20,903
do we honor
our interconnection,

242
00:14:20,947 --> 00:14:23,950
or do we curl inward

243
00:14:23,993 --> 00:14:27,388
like a leaf pulled
from its tree?

244
00:14:27,431 --> 00:14:30,565
After the Burn,
that is what many chose.

245
00:14:30,608 --> 00:14:34,221
But this is a new era.

246
00:14:34,264 --> 00:14:37,050
Is it not?

247
00:14:37,093 --> 00:14:40,183
If you tell me you made a dress
uniform for Grudge, I'll stay.

248
00:14:40,227 --> 00:14:43,708
Almost, all right? Almost stay.

249
00:14:43,752 --> 00:14:47,625
No, you shouldn't miss your
nephew's Ikhu Zhen ceremony.

250
00:14:47,669 --> 00:14:50,063
A boy only becomes a man once.

251
00:14:50,106 --> 00:14:52,065
But this is a big deal, right?

252
00:14:52,108 --> 00:14:56,112
Starfleet Academy reopening
after 125 years.

253
00:14:56,156 --> 00:14:58,723
You introducing the president.

254
00:14:58,767 --> 00:15:00,900
Which you're not excited about.

255
00:15:00,943 --> 00:15:03,772
Why would you think that?
You got your growly face on.

256
00:15:03,815 --> 00:15:06,383
I don't have a growly face.
Yes, you do.

257
00:15:06,427 --> 00:15:08,908
You get that 11
between your eyebrows.

258
00:15:10,213 --> 00:15:11,911
Mm.

259
00:15:13,782 --> 00:15:14,826
Oh.

260
00:15:16,393 --> 00:15:18,265
President Rillak is using
this moment,

261
00:15:18,308 --> 00:15:20,267
which should be
about the cadets

262
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:22,922
and the people that fought to
bring the Academy back to life.

263
00:15:22,965 --> 00:15:24,706
She's doing what politicians do.

264
00:15:24,749 --> 00:15:26,490
Don't punch her in the head.

265
00:15:26,534 --> 00:15:28,884
I will do my best.

266
00:15:32,061 --> 00:15:34,194
I'm sorry
Saru's not here to see it.

267
00:15:34,237 --> 00:15:37,240
Yeah, me, too.

268
00:15:37,284 --> 00:15:39,677
It's okay.
He'll come back when he's ready.

269
00:15:39,721 --> 00:15:43,159
Mm.
And I will join you
on Kwejian soon.

270
00:15:43,203 --> 00:15:44,944
You know you got lucky today.

271
00:15:44,987 --> 00:15:47,642
Luck is being ready.
Oh, come on. We weren't ready.

272
00:15:47,685 --> 00:15:50,514
Are you seriously
complimenting yourself

273
00:15:50,558 --> 00:15:52,952
for nearly getting us killed?
It worked, didn't it?

274
00:15:52,995 --> 00:15:54,344
Kind of.
Mm.

275
00:15:54,388 --> 00:15:56,912
See you soon.
Okay.

276
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,132
Be safe.

277
00:16:01,873 --> 00:16:03,919
Captain.

278
00:16:16,584 --> 00:16:18,542
Last year at this time,

279
00:16:18,586 --> 00:16:20,501
Federation Headquarters
was cloaked.

280
00:16:20,544 --> 00:16:23,025
The Federation itself
had 38 member worlds.

281
00:16:23,069 --> 00:16:25,245
Now, we have 59.

282
00:16:25,288 --> 00:16:27,943
And the cloaking shield
is nearly gone.

283
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,163
There's no more need to hide.

284
00:16:30,206 --> 00:16:33,166
Today we reopen
Starfleet Academy

285
00:16:33,209 --> 00:16:36,038
for the first time
since the Burn.

286
00:16:36,082 --> 00:16:41,000
And in this moment, I feel like
anything is possible.

287
00:16:41,043 --> 00:16:43,480
You are tomorrow's ensigns,

288
00:16:43,524 --> 00:16:46,005
lieutenants, commanders

289
00:16:46,048 --> 00:16:48,268
and captains.

290
00:16:48,311 --> 00:16:50,313
And in this new world,

291
00:16:50,357 --> 00:16:52,924
all of you will go
where no one has gone before.

292
00:16:52,968 --> 00:16:55,101
And you will make the path
by traveling it.

293
00:16:55,144 --> 00:16:58,191
And from what I see,

294
00:16:58,234 --> 00:17:01,324
from what I see,

295
00:17:01,368 --> 00:17:04,066
I am honored
to be in your company.

296
00:17:20,517 --> 00:17:23,999
And now, please allow me
to introduce our special guest,

297
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:27,872
the new president of
the Federation, Laira Rillak.

298
00:17:36,968 --> 00:17:38,840
Thank you, Captain Burnham.

299
00:17:40,102 --> 00:17:42,757
Let me begin by acknowledging

300
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,368
that today would not be possible

301
00:17:45,412 --> 00:17:47,631
without the USS Discovery

302
00:17:47,675 --> 00:17:52,114
and... your crew.

303
00:17:52,158 --> 00:17:54,551
Thanks to your efforts,

304
00:17:54,595 --> 00:17:57,467
we now have a vast supply
of dilithium

305
00:17:57,511 --> 00:18:00,340
we can distribute
to distant worlds,

306
00:18:00,383 --> 00:18:04,474
and we have reestablished
peaceful relations with planets

307
00:18:04,518 --> 00:18:07,086
that-well, they were
antagonizing our members

308
00:18:07,129 --> 00:18:08,826
only five months ago.

309
00:18:10,741 --> 00:18:12,787
It's a lot to live up to.

310
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:14,832
No pressure.

311
00:18:15,964 --> 00:18:18,619
We are learning

312
00:18:18,662 --> 00:18:21,535
from the mistakes of the past,

313
00:18:21,578 --> 00:18:23,493
developing new technologies

314
00:18:23,537 --> 00:18:26,496
to reduce our collective
dependence on dilithium

315
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:31,545
and continuing to rebuild
the Federation and Starfleet.

316
00:18:34,678 --> 00:18:38,813
Not that any of you
need the reminder, but

317
00:18:38,856 --> 00:18:41,468
one of Starfleet's
original missions

318
00:18:41,511 --> 00:18:44,123
was scientific exploration.

319
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:46,560
And now that we are able,

320
00:18:46,603 --> 00:18:50,346
we are embracing that mission
once again.

321
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:54,089
Cadets, if I may turn
your attention

322
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:57,788
to the newly-constructed
Archer Space Dock.

323
00:19:07,711 --> 00:19:11,193
Here, our existing fleet
will be upgraded,

324
00:19:11,237 --> 00:19:15,458
and the next generation of
Starfleet vessels constructed.

325
00:19:15,502 --> 00:19:19,201
Vessels that will once again
take us to new worlds,

326
00:19:19,245 --> 00:19:21,377
new civilizations,

327
00:19:21,421 --> 00:19:25,207
places you can't even begin
to imagine right now.

328
00:19:31,735 --> 00:19:33,520
Look up there.

329
00:19:33,563 --> 00:19:36,044
Yeah.
Whoa!
Yeah.

330
00:19:36,087 --> 00:19:38,394
Heard you guys had some fun
with the Alshains.

331
00:19:38,438 --> 00:19:40,962
Yeah. Might have to cover
your shifts more often.

332
00:19:41,005 --> 00:19:43,094
Ah. Don't get too cozy.

333
00:19:43,138 --> 00:19:45,358
I'm only consulting on the Curry
for another two days.

334
00:19:45,401 --> 00:19:46,837
It is a privilege
to be here.

335
00:19:46,881 --> 00:19:48,926
I wish I could
properly thank you all

336
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:50,841
for everything you left behind.

337
00:19:50,885 --> 00:19:52,365
We appreciate that.

338
00:19:52,408 --> 00:19:54,105
Well, it was our duty,
Madam President.

339
00:19:54,149 --> 00:19:57,239
But still, 930 years
is a long way from home.

340
00:19:57,283 --> 00:19:59,720
From this perspective, can't
really get a sense of the scale.

341
00:19:59,763 --> 00:20:03,027
But later on...

342
00:20:03,071 --> 00:20:06,074
Hmm?

343
00:20:06,117 --> 00:20:08,555
Those cadets-that feels like

344
00:20:08,598 --> 00:20:10,034
one thousand years ago.

345
00:20:10,078 --> 00:20:11,949
Oh.
And yesterday.

346
00:20:11,993 --> 00:20:13,734
Which is was, simultaneously.

347
00:20:13,777 --> 00:20:16,127
Did you know
there are people out there

348
00:20:16,171 --> 00:20:18,217
that don't have to put up
with space-time shenanigans?

349
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,696
I bet they sleep great.

350
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:22,569
Mm. Good for them.

351
00:20:25,615 --> 00:20:28,836
"Lieutenant" used
to feel so far away.

352
00:20:28,879 --> 00:20:31,142
Is this about Osyraa?

353
00:20:31,186 --> 00:20:33,144
'Cause you deserve
that promotion, Tilly.

354
00:20:33,188 --> 00:20:35,234
You all do.
Oh, I know.

355
00:20:35,277 --> 00:20:37,192
I think, I...

356
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:40,804
Captain, the admiral needs you.
It's urgent.

357
00:20:43,024 --> 00:20:46,201
This is Commander Nalas
from Deep-Space

358
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:49,117
Repair Beta Six,
sending a request for help

359
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,424
from any Starfleet vessel
that might hear us.

360
00:20:51,467 --> 00:20:53,077
I'm not sure what happened,

361
00:20:53,121 --> 00:20:55,297
but we just lost
reactor-control thrusters.

362
00:20:55,341 --> 00:20:58,605
Gravitational stability
is also compromised, and...

363
00:20:58,648 --> 00:21:00,215
That's all we got.

364
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,435
How long ago did this happen?
Two hours.

365
00:21:02,478 --> 00:21:04,437
Whatever affected the station
also knocked out

366
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,483
the subspace relays
in the sector.
Solar flare?

367
00:21:07,527 --> 00:21:09,877
Electromagnetic pulse could
have taken all systems offline.

368
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,922
Haven't gotten any reports
of an EMP,

369
00:21:11,966 --> 00:21:14,708
but we'll check it out.
Kwejian is the nearest system.

370
00:21:14,751 --> 00:21:17,101
I'll check and see
if they know anything.
Can Kwejian help?

371
00:21:17,145 --> 00:21:18,668
We can't allow them to wait

372
00:21:18,712 --> 00:21:20,322
for a rescue vessel
to reach them at warp.

373
00:21:20,366 --> 00:21:21,845
Discovery will go right away.

374
00:21:21,889 --> 00:21:24,326
Your mission is to repair
the station systems

375
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:26,285
and to report back as soon
as you figure out what happened.

376
00:21:26,328 --> 00:21:27,721
Yes, sir.

377
00:21:27,764 --> 00:21:29,331
I'd like to join.

378
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:31,812
See that spore drive of yours
in action.

379
00:21:31,855 --> 00:21:34,467
Madam President,
safety protocols.

380
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:36,251
We can't put you at risk, ma'am.

381
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:39,950
Well, thank you for your
concern, but I can't ask anyone

382
00:21:39,994 --> 00:21:42,344
for a sacrifice I'm not willing
to make myself.

383
00:21:42,388 --> 00:21:45,478
Ma'am, having you aboard
Discovery heightens the danger.

384
00:21:48,002 --> 00:21:49,917
To my crew.

385
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,833
I appreciate your passion,
Captain.

386
00:21:52,876 --> 00:21:55,096
I'll see you on board.

387
00:22:03,147 --> 00:22:05,019
I know that look well enough.

388
00:22:05,062 --> 00:22:07,021
Admiral, she's trying
to prove herself.

389
00:22:07,064 --> 00:22:08,849
She wants to say
she's seen action.

390
00:22:08,892 --> 00:22:11,547
I think
she's ticking off a box.

391
00:22:11,591 --> 00:22:13,636
Captain,
this is a delicate time.

392
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:18,598
We're all still learning what we
need as we grow the Federation.

393
00:22:18,641 --> 00:22:21,383
I'm pretty sure we don't need
politics as usual.

394
00:22:21,427 --> 00:22:23,342
Well, you may not like
to hear it,

395
00:22:23,385 --> 00:22:25,996
but an adept politician can be
a very powerful tool

396
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,824
when the world feels
upside down.

397
00:22:27,868 --> 00:22:31,741
And the president doesn't need
your permission

398
00:22:31,785 --> 00:22:33,308
to board Discovery.

399
00:22:35,005 --> 00:22:37,399
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm...
I'm late for dinner.

400
00:22:37,443 --> 00:22:38,792
Sir?

401
00:22:40,054 --> 00:22:42,578
I'm so glad you were able
to bring your family home.

402
00:22:47,757 --> 00:22:49,368
See you when you get back.

403
00:22:49,411 --> 00:22:51,935
And give Mr. Booker my best.

404
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:58,899
President Rillak
will be joining us.

405
00:22:58,942 --> 00:23:02,119
Standard protocols apply.

406
00:23:03,164 --> 00:23:05,340
Commander Detmer, take us
to safe range for the jump.

407
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:07,081
Black alert.
Aye, Captain.

408
00:23:08,604 --> 00:23:10,911
Madam President,
you may want to brace yourself.

409
00:23:10,954 --> 00:23:12,608
The first one can be
disorienting.

410
00:23:12,652 --> 00:23:14,131
I'll be fine.

411
00:23:14,175 --> 00:23:16,656
Flew cargo ships
for my father back in the day.

412
00:23:16,699 --> 00:23:18,397
Okay.

413
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,051
Jump.

414
00:23:32,498 --> 00:23:34,456
Owosekun, do we have

415
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,502
the station?
I'm locked onto it,
but something's wrong.

416
00:23:36,545 --> 00:23:37,633
Onscreen.

417
00:23:40,549 --> 00:23:42,682
What the hell?

418
00:23:44,988 --> 00:23:46,512
What could have done that?

419
00:23:46,555 --> 00:23:48,905
Definitely not a solar flare.
Whatever it was,

420
00:23:48,949 --> 00:23:50,298
the station can't take
that kind of stress much longer.

421
00:23:50,341 --> 00:23:51,604
Neither can its crew.

422
00:23:51,647 --> 00:23:53,954
Yellow Alert. Let's get into it.

423
00:24:09,535 --> 00:24:11,667
Wow.

424
00:24:11,711 --> 00:24:13,974
Kyheem.

425
00:24:14,017 --> 00:24:16,716
So much more beautiful
than I remember.

426
00:24:20,415 --> 00:24:22,417
Can you feel it?

427
00:24:28,379 --> 00:24:30,730
Oh, yeah.

428
00:24:30,773 --> 00:24:33,341
Hello, old friend.

429
00:24:33,384 --> 00:24:35,517
When was the last time
you saw it?

430
00:24:35,561 --> 00:24:38,999
Not since I became
a member of the pack myself.

431
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:48,443
You do the honors.

432
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:06,853
The World Root.

433
00:25:06,896 --> 00:25:08,158
Put your hand on it.

434
00:25:08,202 --> 00:25:09,638
The warmth you feel

435
00:25:09,682 --> 00:25:12,467
is a chain of a million hands.

436
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:15,035
We do this to remember.

437
00:25:15,078 --> 00:25:17,820
We do this because
the universe is unknowable,

438
00:25:17,864 --> 00:25:20,301
but we can know this.

439
00:25:21,302 --> 00:25:23,870
You're now part of a chain
that goes back,

440
00:25:23,913 --> 00:25:25,915
unbroken.

441
00:25:25,959 --> 00:25:28,483
This root system
that reaches all the way

442
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:30,180
around Kwejian,

443
00:25:30,224 --> 00:25:32,618
it is our heart.

444
00:25:32,661 --> 00:25:35,708
And its sap is in that amulet
your father wears.

445
00:25:36,709 --> 00:25:38,754
Today you'll get your own.

446
00:25:39,929 --> 00:25:41,714
It's something
you never take off.

447
00:25:41,757 --> 00:25:44,978
Why aren't you wearing
yours, Uncle Book?

448
00:25:46,066 --> 00:25:48,677
It's a story
for another day, Leto.
Okay.

449
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,858
The sap of the root...

450
00:25:57,686 --> 00:25:59,601
...and the blood of your family.

451
00:25:59,645 --> 00:26:02,865
Wear this...

452
00:26:02,909 --> 00:26:04,388
carry us

453
00:26:04,432 --> 00:26:06,347
and Kwejian with you...

454
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:07,957
always.

455
00:26:24,408 --> 00:26:26,802
I'm proud of you, Leto.

456
00:26:26,846 --> 00:26:28,499
Thanks.
You're very welcome.

457
00:26:28,543 --> 00:26:30,589
Go show your friends, go.

458
00:26:30,632 --> 00:26:31,938
Okay.

459
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:47,301
I'm happy you're here.

460
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:52,045
Thank you for asking me
to be a part of it

461
00:27:10,454 --> 00:27:13,980
Scans show the station moving
at 720 kilometers per second

462
00:27:14,023 --> 00:27:16,809
with a radial velocity
of 22 degrees per second.

463
00:27:16,852 --> 00:27:19,768
Shields are down with a slight
magnetization of the hull.

464
00:27:19,812 --> 00:27:21,552
Something must've hit them.

465
00:27:21,596 --> 00:27:23,859
Still no response yet, Captain.
Keep hailing the station.

466
00:27:23,903 --> 00:27:25,905
Let me know when you have them.

467
00:27:25,948 --> 00:27:27,515
Commander Owosekun,
pull up the distress call.

468
00:27:27,558 --> 00:27:29,082
Aye, Captain.

469
00:27:29,125 --> 00:27:31,127
This is Commander Nalas
from Deep-Space

470
00:27:31,171 --> 00:27:32,694
Repair Beta Six--
Stop.

471
00:27:35,436 --> 00:27:38,178
Beside him, the window--
magnify that.

472
00:27:40,615 --> 00:27:43,836
Oh... it's extreme lensing.

473
00:27:43,879 --> 00:27:45,968
Two-pi steradian solid angle.

474
00:27:46,012 --> 00:27:47,666
In Federation Standard, please?

475
00:27:47,709 --> 00:27:49,929
Gravitational distortion.
Hit the side of the station,

476
00:27:49,972 --> 00:27:52,279
must've taken out the relay,
as well. Commander Rhys?

477
00:27:52,322 --> 00:27:54,020
I don't see anything
that could've created

478
00:27:54,063 --> 00:27:55,151
a distortion that large.

479
00:27:55,195 --> 00:27:56,718
Keep looking and follow up

480
00:27:56,762 --> 00:27:58,459
with Kwejian,
see if they have anything yet.

481
00:27:58,502 --> 00:28:01,680
Aye, Captain.
Captain,
I have Commander Nalas.

482
00:28:03,812 --> 00:28:06,989
Commander Nalas, I'm Captain
Burnham of the U.S.S. Discovery.

483
00:28:07,033 --> 00:28:08,774
President Rillak is here
with us as well.

484
00:28:08,817 --> 00:28:10,427
Ma'am. It's an honor.

485
00:28:10,471 --> 00:28:12,081
Captain, thank you for coming.

486
00:28:12,125 --> 00:28:13,561
What's your status?

487
00:28:13,604 --> 00:28:15,737
We were hit by something.
I don't know what.

488
00:28:15,781 --> 00:28:17,565
We've got all ten of us
in the main control room.

489
00:28:17,608 --> 00:28:19,741
Life support seems to be gone
everywhere else.

490
00:28:19,785 --> 00:28:21,874
Inertial dampeners are
fluctuating,

491
00:28:21,917 --> 00:28:23,571
artificial gravity is a mess

492
00:28:23,614 --> 00:28:25,486
and our sensors are unreliable.

493
00:28:25,529 --> 00:28:27,488
One of my engineers called it
a "shit-show."

494
00:28:27,531 --> 00:28:29,620
Which is Earth for "bad,"

495
00:28:29,664 --> 00:28:32,406
I'm told.
It is, indeed. How can we help?

496
00:28:32,449 --> 00:28:34,451
Well, I can fix thrusters,
that'll stop the spin.

497
00:28:34,495 --> 00:28:36,758
But our Q-nodes are squiddled

498
00:28:36,802 --> 00:28:38,934
and they need to be replaced.

499
00:28:38,978 --> 00:28:40,893
If you can send engineers

500
00:28:40,936 --> 00:28:43,243
with programmable matter,
we can get on it.

501
00:28:43,286 --> 00:28:44,984
Will do, stand by.

502
00:28:46,637 --> 00:28:47,726
"Squiddled?"

503
00:28:47,769 --> 00:28:48,944
Akoszonam expression.

504
00:28:48,988 --> 00:28:50,685
It means
"destroyed beyond repair."

505
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,861
Tilly, what do you know
about replacing Q-nodes?

506
00:28:52,905 --> 00:28:54,558
I can do it,
but if you want it fast,

507
00:28:54,602 --> 00:28:56,430
Adira grew up using this tech.

508
00:28:56,473 --> 00:28:58,301
Have them come up,
and I want you with them.

509
00:28:58,345 --> 00:29:00,260
Owosekun, can you get
a lock on the station's

510
00:29:00,303 --> 00:29:01,870
control room for transport?

511
00:29:01,914 --> 00:29:03,524
I can get coordinates within
an acceptable margin

512
00:29:03,567 --> 00:29:05,569
of error if Keyla can match
speed and rotation.

513
00:29:05,613 --> 00:29:07,484
What do you mean, "if"?

514
00:29:07,528 --> 00:29:08,834
On your mark.

515
00:29:08,877 --> 00:29:11,227
Aye, Captain.

516
00:29:25,676 --> 00:29:27,200
We're at 20...

517
00:29:27,243 --> 00:29:29,202
First away mission.

518
00:29:29,245 --> 00:29:30,725
Are you nervous?

519
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:33,423
Um... no.

520
00:29:33,467 --> 00:29:36,165
Fine, maybe.

521
00:29:36,209 --> 00:29:39,821
I just, I mean,
she made me an ensign.

522
00:29:39,865 --> 00:29:42,084
So she has faith in me.

523
00:29:42,128 --> 00:29:43,869
I...

524
00:29:43,912 --> 00:29:45,958
just want to show her
she made the right choice.

525
00:29:46,001 --> 00:29:47,481
You're gonna be great.

526
00:29:47,524 --> 00:29:49,744
And when I incorporate--

527
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:52,312
How about "get a body"?
Get a body.

528
00:29:52,355 --> 00:29:54,923
And I start kicking ass
doing my own stuff,

529
00:29:54,967 --> 00:29:56,620
I'd expect you to say
the same thing to me.

530
00:29:56,664 --> 00:29:58,753
Yeah, you won't need it.

531
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:00,842
You're, like, the most
confident person I know.

532
00:30:00,886 --> 00:30:03,236
Besides the captain, maybe.

533
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:05,151
We are now
in a synchronous orbit, Captain.

534
00:30:05,194 --> 00:30:06,413
Owo should be good to go.

535
00:30:08,328 --> 00:30:10,069
Ensign Tal, are you ready?

536
00:30:10,112 --> 00:30:11,722
Yes. Absolutely.

537
00:30:11,766 --> 00:30:13,855
Yeah, um...
uh, locked and loaded.

538
00:30:13,899 --> 00:30:16,902
You know, signed,
sealed, delivered.

539
00:30:16,945 --> 00:30:18,338
Ready to...

540
00:30:18,381 --> 00:30:19,861
stop talking now.

541
00:30:19,905 --> 00:30:21,428
Good luck.

542
00:30:21,471 --> 00:30:23,343
Both of you.

543
00:30:33,657 --> 00:30:35,921
Welcome
to our gravity nightmare.

544
00:30:35,964 --> 00:30:37,313
Q-nodes are in there.

545
00:30:37,357 --> 00:30:40,099
Uh, I have
the programmable matter.

546
00:30:40,142 --> 00:30:42,318
Oh, hey, whoa!
Please do not touch that!

547
00:30:42,362 --> 00:30:44,146
Sir, we're here at your request.

548
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:46,845
Right, but it's my station,
my responsibility.

549
00:30:46,888 --> 00:30:48,890
Okay, but, uh, polyhedronic

550
00:30:48,934 --> 00:30:51,458
quantum-data
memory devices are kind of--
Insanely tricky.

551
00:30:51,501 --> 00:30:53,895
And yes, I know what happens
when they're not properly

552
00:30:53,939 --> 00:30:55,810
linked to the multi-phasic
processing unit.

553
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:58,595
I'm sorry,
I don't mean to be rude.

554
00:30:58,639 --> 00:31:00,467
I'm just trying
to protect my crew.

555
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:02,599
Okay, let's let,
uh, Commander Nalas

556
00:31:02,643 --> 00:31:04,645
take the lead here
since we're his guests.

557
00:31:04,688 --> 00:31:06,908
Thanks, we got to get
thrusters working first.

558
00:31:06,952 --> 00:31:09,389
I'm working on the primary
processing unit.

559
00:31:09,432 --> 00:31:11,434
You two take the secondary unit.

560
00:31:11,478 --> 00:31:13,523
And-and thank you.

561
00:31:24,273 --> 00:31:26,319
♪

562
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,122
Commander Nalas,
I think we got it.

563
00:31:47,166 --> 00:31:48,819
Initiating full thrusters

564
00:31:48,863 --> 00:31:51,692
in three, two, one.

565
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,958
Captain, can you confirm
that all the thrusters

566
00:31:57,002 --> 00:31:58,873
are currently working?
I can.

567
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:01,571
Radial velocity's decreased
by 38% and counting.

568
00:32:01,615 --> 00:32:03,965
Nice job. How are life support
and sensors coming?

569
00:32:04,009 --> 00:32:06,663
Just getting started now.
How much longer do you need?

570
00:32:06,707 --> 00:32:09,449
45 minutes, maybe?
You got it.

571
00:32:09,492 --> 00:32:11,451
Captain, we've got incoming.

572
00:32:11,494 --> 00:32:13,670
Debris of some kind.

573
00:32:16,282 --> 00:32:17,674
Commander Owosekun, analysis.

574
00:32:17,718 --> 00:32:19,415
It's frozen methane.

575
00:32:19,459 --> 00:32:21,330
Shields up. Red alert.

576
00:32:21,374 --> 00:32:23,115
Can we extend shields
over the station?

577
00:32:23,158 --> 00:32:24,812
I think so, but it will drain
a lot of power.

578
00:32:24,855 --> 00:32:26,248
Do it. We'll figure it out.

579
00:32:34,517 --> 00:32:36,519
Uh, Captain, what's happening?

580
00:32:36,563 --> 00:32:38,782
The edge of an Oort Cloud--
methane ice.

581
00:32:38,826 --> 00:32:40,697
It must've been carried in
by the gravitational distortion.

582
00:32:40,741 --> 00:32:42,525
Hang tight. How big is it?

583
00:32:42,569 --> 00:32:44,223
Still trying to calculate.

584
00:32:44,266 --> 00:32:45,485
Small stuff was just the front.

585
00:32:45,528 --> 00:32:47,400
The rest is about to hit--
hold on.

586
00:32:51,534 --> 00:32:53,058
How long will shields hold?

587
00:32:53,101 --> 00:32:54,624
15 minutes, if we're lucky.

588
00:32:54,668 --> 00:32:56,104
Lieutenant Tilly,
this is now a rescue mission.

589
00:32:56,148 --> 00:32:58,063
Prepare to beam back
with Adira and the crew.

590
00:32:58,106 --> 00:33:00,282
It's not gonna work from here.
There's too much interference.

591
00:33:00,326 --> 00:33:01,544
Owosekun?

592
00:33:03,068 --> 00:33:05,070
I can't, either, the transport
array isn't responding.

593
00:33:05,113 --> 00:33:06,506
Commander Stamets!

594
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,814
Commander Stamets!
Uh... the impacts caused

595
00:33:10,858 --> 00:33:12,686
a power surge

596
00:33:12,729 --> 00:33:14,949
that, uh, blew out
the Heisenberg compensator.

597
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:16,864
How long to fix it?

598
00:33:16,907 --> 00:33:18,170
Three hours, minimum.

599
00:33:18,213 --> 00:33:19,562
We don't have that kind of time.

600
00:33:19,606 --> 00:33:22,043
What happened anyway?
Is-is Adira okay?

601
00:33:22,087 --> 00:33:23,914
And Tilly and everyone?

602
00:33:23,958 --> 00:33:26,308
Everyone's fine for now.
Skip the compensator.

603
00:33:26,352 --> 00:33:28,006
Pull whatever power you can
to the shields.

604
00:33:28,049 --> 00:33:29,485
We need time to evacuate them.

605
00:33:29,529 --> 00:33:30,660
On it.

606
00:33:30,704 --> 00:33:31,966
Tilly, can you get everyone

607
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:34,055
to the station's shuttle bay?

608
00:33:34,099 --> 00:33:36,188
That's on Deck One and-and...

609
00:33:36,231 --> 00:33:38,059
we don't have
EV suits up here.

610
00:33:38,103 --> 00:33:40,670
What about an escape vessel?
Every deck should have one.

611
00:33:40,714 --> 00:33:42,324
They're only meant
for one-way trips.

612
00:33:42,368 --> 00:33:44,544
I can just reprogram it
to return.

613
00:33:44,587 --> 00:33:46,372
So just trust me with this.

614
00:33:46,415 --> 00:33:47,590
Please. I got it.

615
00:33:49,375 --> 00:33:50,637
Make it fast, Ensign.

616
00:33:51,725 --> 00:33:54,380
It's this way.

617
00:33:59,602 --> 00:34:01,822
The-the door is jammed

618
00:34:01,865 --> 00:34:03,171
from the outside.
We can't separate

619
00:34:03,215 --> 00:34:04,651
the vessel from the station.

620
00:34:04,694 --> 00:34:07,306
Okay, then we need
to climb to another deck.

621
00:34:07,349 --> 00:34:09,047
There's no life support.

622
00:34:09,873 --> 00:34:12,050
Sensors are malfunctioning.

623
00:34:12,093 --> 00:34:13,312
Commander Nalas,
I understand that that

624
00:34:13,355 --> 00:34:15,270
seems like an option right now--

625
00:34:15,314 --> 00:34:16,967
It is an option.

626
00:34:17,011 --> 00:34:18,882
It's the only option.

627
00:34:18,926 --> 00:34:20,841
Uh, Captain, we...

628
00:34:20,884 --> 00:34:22,451
we have a problem.

629
00:34:22,495 --> 00:34:25,106
Uh, two, actually--
the de-coupler is jammed

630
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:27,761
and-and Nalas is
kind of losing it.
Tilly can handle him.

631
00:34:27,804 --> 00:34:30,590
We'll get you all out. Bring
the escape vessel onscreen.

632
00:34:32,809 --> 00:34:34,202
Shield down to 30%.

633
00:34:34,246 --> 00:34:35,769
Commander Nilsson,
how long will it take

634
00:34:35,812 --> 00:34:37,858
our DOTs to remove that debris?

635
00:34:37,901 --> 00:34:39,512
Longer than we have!

636
00:34:39,555 --> 00:34:41,514
Can we get close enough
for a spacewalk?

637
00:34:41,557 --> 00:34:43,124
No, but I-I could take
a worker bee.

638
00:34:43,168 --> 00:34:45,170
That's way too dangerous.
If we lose shields...

639
00:34:45,213 --> 00:34:47,824
Detmer's right, that's our best
shot, but I'll do it.

640
00:34:47,868 --> 00:34:50,784
Rhys, you have the conn.
Are you sure you should be
leaving the ship

641
00:34:50,827 --> 00:34:52,220
during a red alert?

642
00:34:52,264 --> 00:34:54,135
There's no margin for error.

643
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:57,225
I've logged more advanced EVA
hours than anyone else on board.

644
00:34:57,269 --> 00:34:59,488
That makes me the safest
and the most logical choice.

645
00:34:59,532 --> 00:35:01,664
Does it?

646
00:35:01,708 --> 00:35:04,276
Madam President, are you
questioning my decision?

647
00:35:04,319 --> 00:35:07,061
A question doesn't imply
questioning, Captain.

648
00:35:10,369 --> 00:35:13,807
Whatever happens,
keep those shields up.

649
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:15,156
Aye, Captain.

♪

651
00:35:35,263 --> 00:35:39,180
You're thinking of Discovery
again, of your friends.

00:35:39,224 --> 00:35:41,487
Michael.

653
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:43,924
I am.

654
00:35:43,967 --> 00:35:47,057
And it does not mean
that I am unhappy here.

655
00:35:47,101 --> 00:35:49,712
It is hard to be away.

656
00:35:50,757 --> 00:35:52,976
As it was hard to leave Kaminar

657
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:54,674
all those years ago.

658
00:35:56,589 --> 00:35:58,504
One cannot have

659
00:35:58,547 --> 00:36:01,202
all the lives one desires.

660
00:36:01,246 --> 00:36:03,465
A choice

661
00:36:03,509 --> 00:36:05,728
is always necessary.

662
00:36:05,772 --> 00:36:07,600
Then, perhaps.

663
00:36:07,643 --> 00:36:10,603
Kaminar was very different
in your time.

664
00:36:10,646 --> 00:36:12,561
Now...

665
00:36:12,605 --> 00:36:14,694
you can serve the Federation

666
00:36:14,737 --> 00:36:17,349
and remain close to the council.

667
00:36:17,392 --> 00:36:19,612
To me.

668
00:36:19,655 --> 00:36:22,441
I made a promise to you.

669
00:36:22,484 --> 00:36:25,226
And it is my joy
to keep that promise.

670
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:28,098
I appreciate all you have done.

671
00:36:29,317 --> 00:36:31,798
You're the father I never knew.

672
00:36:31,841 --> 00:36:34,235
And my first

673
00:36:34,279 --> 00:36:36,150
true friend.

674
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:38,239
But I have other friends now.

675
00:36:38,283 --> 00:36:39,806
Family.

676
00:36:39,849 --> 00:36:41,851
If you...

677
00:36:41,895 --> 00:36:44,245
are staying for me,

678
00:36:44,289 --> 00:36:46,595
you need not.

679
00:36:47,553 --> 00:36:50,860
What of those
who still turn away from you?

680

Who see you
and think only of the Burn?

681
00:36:54,429 --> 00:36:57,345
There will always be those

682
00:36:57,389 --> 00:36:59,826
who fear what they do not
understand.

683
00:36:59,869 --> 00:37:03,133
But they are fewer now.

684
00:37:04,874 --> 00:37:07,573
Thanks to you.

685
00:37:07,616 --> 00:37:09,923
I'm safe.

686
00:37:09,966 --> 00:37:12,012
I'm loved.

My heart is here,
but yours can be here

Balance...

691
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,984
is possible.

692

Okay, she's here!

Rhys, you have eyes on that?

We do, Captain.

It's clear of the vessel's
launch trajectory.

700

Great.

701

Patch me through to engineering.

Stamets, how we doing
on shields?
Um...

Yes, I love 25%.

Yeah, well...
...don't celebrate just yet.

708

I've pulled all the power I can
from the EPS grid.

And, uh, we're maxed out.

I can't allow you take your
crew on a suicide mission.

00:39:30,498 --> 00:39:32,413
Okay, please!
Adira, Adira, stay on task.

It's my crew.

And you're leading them
to a very dark place.

Put down the phaser.

Nalas. It's President Rillak.

I know this is a lot,

721
00:39:46,949 --> 00:39:49,430
all of it,
but I am asking you to give

722
00:39:49,474 --> 00:39:51,389
Captain Burnham
a few more minutes.

723

I am confident
she'll get you out.

724

All of us want you to see

725
00:39:55,131 --> 00:39:57,830
your beautiful world again,
i-its...

726
00:39:57,873 --> 00:39:59,832
freshwater oceans,
the Fissure of Jorat.

727
00:39:59,875 --> 00:40:02,443
How do you...?

728
00:40:02,487 --> 00:40:05,577
Most Akoszonam don't
even know the Fissure.

729
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:07,492
Oh, shame.

730
00:40:07,535 --> 00:40:10,973
It's breathtaking, isn't it?
The way the steam explodes

731
00:40:11,017 --> 00:40:14,020
straight out, condensing
into that iridescent mist.

732
00:40:14,063 --> 00:40:16,109
There's nothing else like it
in the cosmos.

733
00:40:16,152 --> 00:40:20,026
I know you want to go home,
Nalas.

All of you do.

735
00:40:21,723 --> 00:40:23,290
Please.

736
00:40:32,212 --> 00:40:33,648
Yes.

737
00:40:35,868 --> 00:40:38,436
Almost there!

738
00:40:38,479 --> 00:40:40,089
Got it! You're clear, Tilly!

739
00:40:40,133 --> 00:40:42,483
Go! We all won't fit
in one trip.

740
00:40:42,527 --> 00:40:44,572
I'll wait with them.

741
00:41:00,632 --> 00:41:03,156
Lieutenant Christopher, open
a channel to the president.

742
00:41:03,199 --> 00:41:05,506
Channel's open, Captain.

743
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:07,334
Captain Burnham.

744
00:41:07,377 --> 00:41:08,466
Thank you for the assist.

745
00:41:08,509 --> 00:41:10,511
Always happy to be of service.

746
00:41:10,555 --> 00:41:13,035
Out of curiosity, were you
reading his file earlier?

747
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:14,602
Or have you really been
to the Fissure of Jorat?

748
00:41:14,646 --> 00:41:16,212
It's not curiosity, Captain.

749
00:41:16,256 --> 00:41:18,519
You're wondering
if I lied to him.

750
00:41:18,563 --> 00:41:20,608
Did you?

751
00:41:20,652 --> 00:41:22,523
Does it matter?

752
00:41:27,572 --> 00:41:29,138
Station crew is safely on board.

753
00:41:29,182 --> 00:41:30,662
The escape vessel

754
00:41:30,705 --> 00:41:32,533
is leaving Discovery
for its second run.

755
00:41:32,577 --> 00:41:34,187
Should be back in five minutes.
How much time do we have left?

756
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:36,145
After that last hit,
four minutes if we're lucky.

757
00:41:37,538 --> 00:41:38,539
When the shields are down,

758
00:41:38,583 --> 00:41:40,106
we'll be exposed.

759
00:41:40,149 --> 00:41:41,368
We could be destroyed.

760
00:41:42,282 --> 00:41:43,501
Captain.

761
00:41:43,544 --> 00:41:45,111
We're not going anywhere.

762
00:41:45,154 --> 00:41:46,852
That was an inspiring speech
you gave

763
00:41:46,895 --> 00:41:48,854
at the Academy,
but everything is not possible.

764
00:41:48,897 --> 00:41:51,247
You cannot defeat
the mathematics of loss.

765
00:41:51,291 --> 00:41:52,553
We have before.
Oh,

766
00:41:52,597 --> 00:41:54,294
so therefore
you're immune to failure?

767
00:41:59,081 --> 00:42:01,736
Are you pulling me
from the chair?

768
00:42:02,607 --> 00:42:04,304
Madam President?

769
00:42:05,261 --> 00:42:07,525
Because if not,
I have a job to do.

770
00:42:08,569 --> 00:42:11,398
You're the captain.

771
00:42:24,585 --> 00:42:26,631
Have you found
what spooked the birds?

772
00:42:26,674 --> 00:42:28,284
I've searched the entire forest.

773
00:42:28,328 --> 00:42:30,112
Nothing out of the ordinary.

774
00:42:30,156 --> 00:42:32,550
Maybe they sensed an earthquake.

775
00:42:32,593 --> 00:42:34,639
Too small for us to feel?

776
00:42:34,682 --> 00:42:36,249
I don't know, Kyheem.

777
00:42:36,292 --> 00:42:38,381
Well, you've been up there
for a while.

778
00:42:38,425 --> 00:42:41,254
Come on back.
It's time for dinner.

779
00:42:42,255 --> 00:42:44,300
These birds.

780
00:42:46,215 --> 00:42:48,174
Take Leto
and get someplace safe.

781
00:42:48,217 --> 00:42:50,698
What is it?
Just do it! Now!

782
00:42:50,742 --> 00:42:53,092
I need to find out
what's happening.

783
00:43:02,231 --> 00:43:05,017
Warning. Proximity alert.
Warning.

784
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:07,410
Proximity alert.

785
00:43:07,454 --> 00:43:10,718
Kyheem!

786
00:43:23,688 --> 00:43:26,865
The nanosecond this is over,
I'm on the first ship home.

787
00:43:26,908 --> 00:43:29,084
When's the last time
you were back?
Too long.

788
00:43:30,825 --> 00:43:32,261
Living on autopilot, you know?

789
00:43:35,047 --> 00:43:37,876
What about you two? What's next?

790
00:43:37,919 --> 00:43:40,487
Oh, you know. Sleep. Tea.

791
00:43:40,530 --> 00:43:42,054
Bubble bath.

792
00:43:43,925 --> 00:43:45,405
Lieutenant?

793
00:43:45,448 --> 00:43:48,147
Oh, uh...

794
00:43:49,235 --> 00:43:52,891
I don't know, to be honest.

795
00:43:57,286 --> 00:43:59,506
Shuttle has arrived.
Let's go.

796
00:43:59,549 --> 00:44:01,073
Let's go.

797
00:44:14,913 --> 00:44:17,045
We've lost shields.

798
00:44:18,481 --> 00:44:20,745
Is the escape vessel okay?

799
00:44:20,788 --> 00:44:21,920
Aye, Captain.

800
00:44:21,963 --> 00:44:23,748
How much longer?

801
00:44:23,791 --> 00:44:25,750
We'll have the vessel
in five. Four.
Black alert.

802
00:44:25,793 --> 00:44:27,577
Three.
Structure breach
on Deck Eight.

803
00:44:27,621 --> 00:44:30,319
Two. One.
Rerouting DOTs for repair.

804
00:44:30,363 --> 00:44:32,670
They're clear. They're clear!
Jump!

805
00:44:41,243 --> 00:44:43,289
All
medical and emergency personnel

806
00:44:43,332 --> 00:44:45,160
to shuttle bay. Repeat.

807
00:44:45,204 --> 00:44:47,728
All medical and emergency
personnel to shuttle bay.

808
00:44:47,772 --> 00:44:50,600
Adira? Tilly?
We're here! We're here!

809
00:44:50,644 --> 00:44:52,733
We're safe. We're good.
Let me do a scan
for injuries.

810
00:44:52,777 --> 00:44:54,343
Nalas?

811
00:44:54,387 --> 00:44:55,823
Commander Nalas?

812
00:44:55,867 --> 00:44:57,042
I don't understand. We...

813
00:44:57,085 --> 00:44:59,087
made it.
We were... We were safe.

814
00:44:59,131 --> 00:45:01,089
Hugh! Hugh!

815
00:45:01,133 --> 00:45:03,309
Help me!

816
00:45:03,352 --> 00:45:05,093
Hold on! Hold on.
I can't...

817
00:45:05,137 --> 00:45:06,704
We almost got you.

818
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:18,367
Over here! Over here!

819
00:45:29,857 --> 00:45:31,729
Culber, what's happening?

820
00:45:32,686 --> 00:45:34,862
Is everyone okay?

821
00:45:53,838 --> 00:45:55,317
Come.

822
00:46:05,850 --> 00:46:09,375
Three dead. Four wounded.

823
00:46:09,418 --> 00:46:11,681
And nine who get to go home.

824
00:46:14,641 --> 00:46:16,251
Never gets easier.

825
00:46:17,209 --> 00:46:20,516
Kobayashi Maru.

826
00:46:21,517 --> 00:46:23,693
You're Starfleet?

827
00:46:24,694 --> 00:46:26,653
No.

828
00:46:26,696 --> 00:46:30,570
Just flew cargo for my dad
all over the sector.

829
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:35,488
Taught me the value
in meeting people

830
00:46:35,531 --> 00:46:39,187
or circumstances where they are.

831
00:46:39,231 --> 00:46:42,756
The test is rigged, you know.

832
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,236
Kobayashi Maru.

833
00:46:45,628 --> 00:46:47,587
They don't tell you that
up front.

834
00:46:50,503 --> 00:46:52,287
So when you fail,

835
00:46:52,331 --> 00:46:54,376
you go back to your quarters,
and all you can think about

836
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:56,074
is how you want to retake it.

837
00:46:56,117 --> 00:46:58,859
How you can be the one
to beat it.

838
00:46:58,903 --> 00:47:01,644
Then you realize you never will.

839
00:47:01,688 --> 00:47:03,298
Yeah, hence the lesson.

840
00:47:03,342 --> 00:47:07,041
Acceptance. There are things
beyond your control.

841
00:47:07,085 --> 00:47:09,391
As captain, you mitigate that
as much as possible,

842
00:47:09,435 --> 00:47:12,786
but...
I can't mitigate
life and death.

843
00:47:14,266 --> 00:47:16,094
I lead to bring everyone home.

844
00:47:16,137 --> 00:47:19,793
Leadership is about balance.

845
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:23,797
Knowing what weight
is yours to carry and...

846
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:26,626
what isn't.

847
00:47:26,669 --> 00:47:29,498
You just don't see that yet.

848
00:47:36,114 --> 00:47:39,073
You didn't come on my ship
to tick a box,

849
00:47:39,117 --> 00:47:40,640
did you?

850
00:47:43,295 --> 00:47:44,862
Well, as you know,
we are developing

851
00:47:44,905 --> 00:47:46,385
some new technologies.

852
00:47:46,428 --> 00:47:49,867
A next-generation spore drive
is among them.

853
00:47:49,910 --> 00:47:52,391
There are still
quite a few hurdles to overcome,

854
00:47:52,434 --> 00:47:53,783
but other technologies,

855
00:47:53,827 --> 00:47:55,785
like the pathway drive
prototype,

856
00:47:55,829 --> 00:47:59,224
have been moving forward nicely.

857
00:47:59,267 --> 00:48:02,618
Plans are to install it
in Voyagerfor testing,

858
00:48:02,662 --> 00:48:07,058
and I am evaluating
my short list for the captaincy.

859
00:48:08,059 --> 00:48:11,018
I suppose I'm no longer on it.

860
00:48:12,019 --> 00:48:14,108
No.

861
00:48:14,152 --> 00:48:16,415
You're not ready.

862
00:48:17,416 --> 00:48:19,461
Define "ready."

863
00:48:19,505 --> 00:48:20,854
Don't misunderstand me, Captain.

864
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:23,248
You are eminently qualified...

865
00:48:23,291 --> 00:48:26,773
Untested technology's
a different beast, I-I get that.

866
00:48:26,816 --> 00:48:29,515
But please,

867
00:48:29,558 --> 00:48:32,431
define "ready."

868
00:48:32,474 --> 00:48:34,389
The willingness to accept

869
00:48:34,433 --> 00:48:37,566
all potential outcomes
of a command decision

870
00:48:37,610 --> 00:48:41,048
and an ability to make
the hard call regardless.

871
00:48:41,092 --> 00:48:43,790
It's a matter of experience,
really.

872
00:48:43,833 --> 00:48:47,925
Respectfully, ma'am,
Discoveryis my home,

873
00:48:47,968 --> 00:48:50,928
so I wouldn't have accepted
even if you'd offered.

874
00:48:50,971 --> 00:48:53,060
That said,

875
00:48:53,104 --> 00:48:54,975
I don't think I'm out of line

876
00:48:55,019 --> 00:48:56,803
in pointing out
that my experiences

877
00:48:56,846 --> 00:48:59,632
have prepared me
for any kind of captaincy.

878
00:48:59,675 --> 00:49:01,199
Yeah, well, you saved us.

879
00:49:01,242 --> 00:49:03,114
You led your crew to the future.

880
00:49:03,157 --> 00:49:04,680
You deciphered the Burn.

881
00:49:04,724 --> 00:49:07,335
Yes. I did.

882
00:49:07,379 --> 00:49:10,817
Your acts of bravery
are irrefutable.

883
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:14,995
They are also huge swings
of the pendulum.

884
00:49:15,039 --> 00:49:18,564
And in a time of rebuilding,
there is a very fine line

885
00:49:18,607 --> 00:49:20,783
between a pendulum

886
00:49:20,827 --> 00:49:23,612
and a wrecking ball.

887
00:49:24,613 --> 00:49:27,573
That is quite a strong opinion

888
00:49:27,616 --> 00:49:29,444
for someone who's just met me.

889
00:49:30,445 --> 00:49:32,012
I read the debrief
of your arrival

890
00:49:32,056 --> 00:49:33,405
at Federation Headquarters.

891
00:49:33,448 --> 00:49:35,189
Would you like to know
what it says?

892
00:49:35,233 --> 00:49:37,844
I take it
that's a rhetorical question.

893
00:49:37,887 --> 00:49:40,064
It says a tremendous loss
in your formative years

894
00:49:40,107 --> 00:49:42,457
has left you
with an almost pathological need

895
00:49:42,501 --> 00:49:44,198
to save everyone you can.

896
00:49:44,242 --> 00:49:46,722
I fail to see the negative
in that.

897
00:49:46,766 --> 00:49:49,421
Commanding
from a place of personal need

898
00:49:49,464 --> 00:49:51,118
places others in harm's way.

899
00:49:51,162 --> 00:49:53,120
Today, you were prepared
to sacrifice the many

900
00:49:53,164 --> 00:49:55,993
to save the few.
Everyone could have died.

901
00:49:56,036 --> 00:49:59,039
But they didn't.
One day, they might.

902
00:50:01,215 --> 00:50:03,957
That is precisely
the kind of Pyrrhic victory

903
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:06,916
Kobayashi Maru
trains you to avoid.

904
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:09,397
Captain,

905
00:50:09,441 --> 00:50:12,487
Mr. Booker's here.
His ship arrived via autopilot.

906
00:50:12,531 --> 00:50:14,315
Something's wrong.

907
00:50:15,316 --> 00:50:17,057
Pull up Kwejian
on the deep-space array.

908
00:50:17,101 --> 00:50:18,493
What happened?

909
00:50:18,537 --> 00:50:20,495
My ship was hit by something.

910
00:50:20,539 --> 00:50:23,498
The stars.
Everything was warped.

911
00:50:23,542 --> 00:50:25,326
The gravitational distortion.

912
00:50:25,370 --> 00:50:26,806
But Kwejian is light-years away

913
00:50:26,849 --> 00:50:27,676
from that station.
Captain?

914
00:50:28,895 --> 00:50:31,854
I inputted
Kwejian's coordinates, but...

915
00:50:31,898 --> 00:50:33,030
What?

916
00:50:33,073 --> 00:50:34,422
Nothing's there.

917
00:50:35,684 --> 00:50:37,556
You must've done it wrong.

918
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:38,992
No.

919
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:40,646
These are the coordinates.

920
00:50:40,689 --> 00:50:42,561
Widen the search radius.

921
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:46,217
I see something,

922
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:47,261
but it's hundreds
of thousands of kilometers away.

923
00:50:47,305 --> 00:50:48,697
Pull it up.

924
00:51:13,809 --> 00:51:15,855
They're gone.

925
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:22,862
They're all gone.
