1
00:00:00,085 --> 00:00:02,265
<i>- Previously on "Deception"...</i>
- Why would you steal

2
00:00:02,297 --> 00:00:04,187
a stained-glass window
and some old watch?

3
00:00:04,221 --> 00:00:05,625
I'm not. We're returning them.

4
00:00:05,671 --> 00:00:07,707
We are building something new.

5
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,023
- What is that?
- "Quest Trek."

6
00:00:09,048 --> 00:00:10,281
- "Quest Trek" the game?
- Yeah.

7
00:00:10,306 --> 00:00:11,808
It's like "Pokémon Go"
except way cooler.

8
00:00:11,833 --> 00:00:13,268
Can you tell us about
the Octagon? What is it?

9
00:00:13,293 --> 00:00:14,895
It's the final quest.

10
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,189
The top point-getters
in the world come together

11
00:00:17,214 --> 00:00:19,150
to compete in a winner-take-all quest.

12
00:00:19,452 --> 00:00:21,654
Figured out who the next
target is... it's you!

13
00:00:21,687 --> 00:00:23,656
Cam, you have to run.

14
00:00:23,689 --> 00:00:25,882
- Hello, Cameron.
- Aah!

15
00:00:33,854 --> 00:00:36,338
You can't make him do this.
Cameron's not ready.

16
00:00:36,378 --> 00:00:38,281
He has to be, so he will be.

17
00:00:38,314 --> 00:00:41,037
Don't worry, Johnny. I've got it.

18
00:00:41,099 --> 00:00:42,952
I can do the third act escape.

19
00:00:42,985 --> 00:00:44,310
Cameron is the better performer.

20
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:47,556
He has to learn on his own. Go.

21
00:01:24,367 --> 00:01:26,536
Oh, you're awake?

22
00:01:26,561 --> 00:01:28,203
Good.

23
00:01:30,277 --> 00:01:32,498
You know, the pool is lovely.

24
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:33,903
You should take a dip.

25
00:01:33,965 --> 00:01:35,834
Where am I?

26
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:37,862
Why did you frame my brother for murder?

27
00:01:37,895 --> 00:01:39,698
And where are my pants?

28
00:01:40,764 --> 00:01:43,400
One, Madrid.

29
00:01:43,434 --> 00:01:47,672
Two... well, that's complicated.

30
00:01:47,705 --> 00:01:50,542
And three, who cares?

31
00:01:50,574 --> 00:01:52,978
You gonna let me out of these things?

32
00:01:54,845 --> 00:01:57,548
And what exactly will you do
if I unlock you?

33
00:01:57,582 --> 00:01:59,750
Run away?

34
00:01:59,783 --> 00:02:01,886
Hurt me?

35
00:02:01,919 --> 00:02:03,722
Something else?

36
00:02:03,755 --> 00:02:06,357
Being this is the first time
I've been handcuffed to a bed

37
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,426
by a beautiful woman
in a foreign country,

38
00:02:08,458 --> 00:02:10,829
you're greatly mistaken.

39
00:02:10,861 --> 00:02:12,129
What is this, really?

40
00:02:12,163 --> 00:02:13,698
A test.

41
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:16,033
I'm deciding if you're ready
to come work for me.

42
00:02:16,066 --> 00:02:17,768
To work for<i> you?</i>

43
00:02:17,802 --> 00:02:20,105
You've been helping the FBI
solve crimes.

44
00:02:20,137 --> 00:02:23,140
I want you to... help me commit one.

45
00:02:24,941 --> 00:02:26,844
Okay. Sure.

46
00:02:26,887 --> 00:02:27,920
Uh, the answer's "No."

47
00:02:27,945 --> 00:02:30,615
That's a hard no.

48
00:02:32,683 --> 00:02:35,387
Here's the question, Cameron.

49
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:38,523
My test for you...

50
00:02:40,825 --> 00:02:44,529
What are you willing to do
to save your brother?

51
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:50,468
You think on that while I take a shower.

52
00:02:53,438 --> 00:02:55,073
Anything.

53
00:02:55,105 --> 00:02:56,874
You sure about that?

54
00:03:42,153 --> 00:03:43,988
Come on. Come on.

55
00:03:58,768 --> 00:04:01,605
63 seconds.

56
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:03,874
That's impressive.

57
00:04:03,908 --> 00:04:05,877
Your hair is dry.

58
00:04:06,978 --> 00:04:10,014
Think it through. Take it apart.

59
00:04:10,046 --> 00:04:13,851
It was somebody else in the shower...

60
00:04:13,885 --> 00:04:15,986
translight of Madrid,

61
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:18,490
you put the pen on the pad
knowing what I would do,

62
00:04:18,522 --> 00:04:19,890
the gun is a prop,

63
00:04:19,923 --> 00:04:23,462
and the elevator only opened
when you were ready.

64
00:04:24,661 --> 00:04:26,164
Almost perfect.

65
00:04:26,197 --> 00:04:27,265
Why?

66
00:04:27,298 --> 00:04:28,967
I told you. A test.

67
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,835
An audition.

68
00:04:30,868 --> 00:04:32,237
Why didn't you shoot me
when you took the gun?

69
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:34,839
'Cause I'm not a psychopath.

70
00:04:34,871 --> 00:04:37,975
You didn't think about the question.

71
00:04:38,008 --> 00:04:40,511
What are you willing to do
to save your brother?

72
00:04:40,544 --> 00:04:42,246
I told you. Anything.

73
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:44,181
It's not a prop.

74
00:04:44,214 --> 00:04:45,250
What?

75
00:04:45,282 --> 00:04:46,617
The gun.

76
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:48,118
It's real.

77
00:04:48,152 --> 00:04:50,988
There's one in the chamber, ready to go.

78
00:04:51,022 --> 00:04:52,991
Pull the trigger.

79
00:04:53,024 --> 00:04:55,627
But it was a test.

80
00:04:55,659 --> 00:04:56,760
Too late.

81
00:05:01,097 --> 00:05:02,633
Remember this.

82
00:05:05,803 --> 00:05:07,305
My tests are real.

83
00:05:07,337 --> 00:05:09,273
Night-night.

84
00:05:12,385 --> 00:05:15,745

85
00:05:59,856 --> 00:06:01,825
Jordan.

86
00:06:01,859 --> 00:06:03,094
Jordan.

87
00:06:04,094 --> 00:06:05,095
Jordan.

88
00:06:06,397 --> 00:06:08,700
Trying to work here, guys. What is it?

89
00:06:08,733 --> 00:06:10,702
Cameron's disappeared.

90
00:06:10,734 --> 00:06:12,803
It's her. The Mystery Woman.
She's got him.

91
00:06:12,837 --> 00:06:14,272
Well, that's what Jonathan thinks.

92
00:06:14,305 --> 00:06:16,107
They were on the phone together
when it happened.

93
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:18,075
- She's gonna kill him.
- No.

94
00:06:18,109 --> 00:06:21,079
What then? She's gonna book him
for a birthday party?

95
00:06:21,111 --> 00:06:23,147
If she wanted to kill him,
she would have done it.

96
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,882
She took him. That means she needs him.

97
00:06:24,914 --> 00:06:26,750
- When did it happen?
- Like two hours ago.

98
00:06:26,784 --> 00:06:29,621
Two hours? Okay.

99
00:06:29,654 --> 00:06:32,023
We have to find him fast.

100
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,869
No! Come on.

101
00:06:45,902 --> 00:06:48,005
Dad, I can't do it!

102
00:06:49,272 --> 00:06:51,176
Help me!

103
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,315
Oh, good.

104
00:06:57,347 --> 00:06:59,282
- Bishop?
- You're up.

105
00:06:59,315 --> 00:07:01,251
She's been waiting.

106
00:07:01,284 --> 00:07:02,854
You know her.

107
00:07:02,887 --> 00:07:04,889
Come on. No resting on the job.

108
00:07:04,921 --> 00:07:06,256
There's work to be done.

109
00:07:06,289 --> 00:07:08,792
What work? What exactly are you doing?

110
00:07:08,825 --> 00:07:11,796
A heist, of course.
And you are the star.

111
00:07:11,828 --> 00:07:13,263
The hell I am.

112
00:07:13,296 --> 00:07:15,265
Now, that is exactly what I said

113
00:07:15,298 --> 00:07:16,933
when she came to me.

114
00:07:16,967 --> 00:07:19,137
Now, I know, it doesn't look like much.

115
00:07:19,169 --> 00:07:22,140
But I assure you, the security
here is state of the art.

116
00:07:22,173 --> 00:07:24,809
We are completely isolated,
we are off the grid,

117
00:07:24,842 --> 00:07:26,810
surrounded by nothing.

118
00:07:26,844 --> 00:07:28,046
We're in New Jersey.

119
00:07:28,078 --> 00:07:29,312
Exactly.

120
00:07:29,346 --> 00:07:31,883
Ah, the team.

121
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:34,952
Meet Mr. Dekker.
He's our weapons expert.

122
00:07:34,984 --> 00:07:37,455
An explosives visionary.

123
00:07:37,488 --> 00:07:40,058
He created the black-trigger bomb

124
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:41,792
for Felix's disappearing plane.

125
00:07:41,825 --> 00:07:43,060
That was a work of art.

126
00:07:43,094 --> 00:07:45,697
Hey. Nice to put a face to the carnage.

127
00:07:45,729 --> 00:07:48,032
Kindly meet Tallis,

128
00:07:48,065 --> 00:07:51,969
our computer expert and make-up genius.

129
00:07:56,741 --> 00:07:58,409
What's in there?

130
00:08:00,411 --> 00:08:02,046
Time for your next test.

131
00:08:06,217 --> 00:08:07,919
What is this?

132
00:08:07,952 --> 00:08:11,055
A mock-up of the main room
at Devlin's Auction House.

133
00:08:11,087 --> 00:08:13,924
We're going to steal a jewel
from the Rockefeller Collection

134
00:08:13,957 --> 00:08:15,726
when it goes up for sale tomorrow.

135
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:19,063
We don't know which one yet,
just its approximate size.

136
00:08:19,096 --> 00:08:21,866
Did you say "Devlin's Auction House"?

137
00:08:21,899 --> 00:08:23,267
I know.

138
00:08:23,299 --> 00:08:25,135
Their security's state of the art.

139
00:08:25,169 --> 00:08:26,720
The vault impenetrable.

140
00:08:26,745 --> 00:08:28,873
That's why we're going to steal
it during the auction itself.

141
00:08:28,906 --> 00:08:30,808
In front of everyone?

142
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,342
Well, there'll be a five-second window

143
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:33,877
to swap the jewel for a copy.

144
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:35,279
Five seconds?

145
00:08:35,312 --> 00:08:38,816
In front of what,
a hundred people on all sides?

146
00:08:38,848 --> 00:08:40,851
Security cameras? Armed guards?

147
00:08:42,119 --> 00:08:44,154
Just like one of your specials.

148
00:08:44,188 --> 00:08:45,356
Okay.

149
00:08:45,389 --> 00:08:47,024
Also the pedestal's equipped

150
00:08:47,057 --> 00:08:48,993
with a hair-trigger motion sensor.

151
00:08:56,066 --> 00:08:57,769
This is your test.

152
00:08:58,869 --> 00:09:00,271
Are you good enough?

153
00:09:01,304 --> 00:09:03,875
You mean, am I fast enough?

154
00:09:03,908 --> 00:09:06,244
Speed is a big part of magic.

155
00:09:06,276 --> 00:09:07,844
Sleight of hand,

156
00:09:07,877 --> 00:09:10,514
prestidigitation just means
"fast fingers."

157
00:09:10,548 --> 00:09:12,850
And when a magician says, "Hey, presto,"

158
00:09:12,882 --> 00:09:15,786
that's just him telling you
how the trick was done...

159
00:09:15,819 --> 00:09:16,787
with speed.

160
00:09:16,821 --> 00:09:18,255
Now, for thousands of years,

161
00:09:18,289 --> 00:09:20,991
the human eye was
the fastest sensor that we had.

162
00:09:21,024 --> 00:09:22,994
But not anymore.

163
00:09:23,026 --> 00:09:26,129
This sensor, the security cameras,

164
00:09:26,163 --> 00:09:28,466
all these eyes...

165
00:09:28,499 --> 00:09:32,036
Your plan is impossible. Sorry.

166
00:09:36,043 --> 00:09:38,144
Not as sorry as I am.

167
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,316
How does he do it?

168
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:50,154
'Course, impossible's kind of my thing.

169
00:09:50,187 --> 00:09:52,089
Oh, so you can do it?

170
00:09:52,121 --> 00:09:54,925
Sure. But I won't.

171
00:09:56,861 --> 00:09:58,229
Your life is on the line.

172
00:09:58,261 --> 00:09:59,830
Hm. Okay.

173
00:09:59,864 --> 00:10:02,466
I don't know how things work
in your business,

174
00:10:02,499 --> 00:10:06,037
but in show business,
this is unacceptable.

175
00:10:06,069 --> 00:10:09,973
First, you frame my brother
for murder and ruin my career.

176
00:10:10,006 --> 00:10:12,476
Second, you kidnap me, knock me out,

177
00:10:12,509 --> 00:10:14,846
and handcuff me naked to a bed.

178
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:16,614
Now, that last part has happened before,

179
00:10:16,646 --> 00:10:18,582
but the part that pisses me off the most

180
00:10:18,616 --> 00:10:21,318
is you then make me audition.

181
00:10:21,351 --> 00:10:24,087
So let me just give you my final final.

182
00:10:24,121 --> 00:10:28,259
Go. To. Hell.

183
00:10:28,292 --> 00:10:30,127
I will not help you.

184
00:10:31,395 --> 00:10:32,864
Ever.

185
00:10:32,896 --> 00:10:34,364
- Cameron?
- What?

186
00:10:34,398 --> 00:10:37,368
You'll want to see this.

187
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,635
This USB contains footage

188
00:10:38,669 --> 00:10:40,605
of the night of Jonathan's accident.

189
00:10:40,638 --> 00:10:43,007
NYPD said the traffic footage was lost.

190
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:45,342
It should be. I took it.

191
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,879
Didn't want them to see this part.

192
00:10:55,318 --> 00:10:57,988
Girl was dead before the accident.

193
00:10:59,323 --> 00:11:00,524
You killed her.

194
00:11:00,557 --> 00:11:03,127
I simply chose an appropriate body.

195
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:06,563
The video on this drive
will exonerate him.

196
00:11:06,597 --> 00:11:09,000
Help me and it's yours.

197
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:12,236
So, one more time.

198
00:11:12,269 --> 00:11:14,371
What are you willing to do
for your brother?

199
00:11:29,218 --> 00:11:30,654
So, what happened?

200
00:11:30,688 --> 00:11:32,255
You did it before.

201
00:11:32,289 --> 00:11:36,559
Yeah, before... I taped down the button.

202
00:11:37,295 --> 00:11:39,333
Duct tape can do anything.

203
00:11:40,046 --> 00:11:41,480
So, that was a trick?

204
00:11:41,505 --> 00:11:43,503
Yeah. They're all tricks.

205
00:11:43,528 --> 00:11:46,247
You didn't think I had
real magic powers, did you?

206
00:11:46,887 --> 00:11:48,614
Back to work.

207
00:11:53,309 --> 00:11:57,580
I will. Just have to, uh, take five.

208
00:12:02,823 --> 00:12:04,659
Is there a reason you're not practicing?

209
00:12:04,692 --> 00:12:06,727
Taping down the button
won't work at the auction.

210
00:12:06,761 --> 00:12:07,996
I don't get it.

211
00:12:08,029 --> 00:12:10,113
You frame my brother for murder,

212
00:12:10,138 --> 00:12:11,176
you made a plane disappear.

213
00:12:11,201 --> 00:12:13,238
This is about more than just one heist.

214
00:12:13,293 --> 00:12:14,869
You got another play here.

215
00:12:15,644 --> 00:12:17,338
That does sound like me.

216
00:12:17,371 --> 00:12:19,473
Maybe I need that mind of yours.

217
00:12:19,619 --> 00:12:21,822
When we first spoke,
you said I didn't remember you.

218
00:12:21,855 --> 00:12:23,657
What did you mean by that?

219
00:12:25,493 --> 00:12:27,128
Give us a minute.

220
00:12:30,029 --> 00:12:32,065
Have you ever seen the aurora borealis?

221
00:12:32,099 --> 00:12:33,600
What?

222
00:12:33,633 --> 00:12:36,571
In the winter.
You can see it from Reykjavík.

223
00:12:38,973 --> 00:12:41,042
This is some kind of code, riddle? What?

224
00:12:42,842 --> 00:12:44,110
Nothing.

225
00:12:44,143 --> 00:12:45,212
I got to go.

226
00:12:45,245 --> 00:12:46,547
Ohh, where?

227
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:47,897
To find out what we're stealing.

228
00:12:47,936 --> 00:12:50,717
No. All right? No, no more
cryptic non-answers.

229
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:53,086
If we're going to be...
working together,

230
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:54,922
then I need to know what's going on.

231
00:12:56,523 --> 00:12:58,558
Hundreds of jewels
in the Rockefeller Collection

232
00:12:58,591 --> 00:12:59,960
are being auctioned off tomorrow.

233
00:12:59,994 --> 00:13:01,162
One is special.

234
00:13:01,195 --> 00:13:03,030
Why?

235
00:13:03,062 --> 00:13:04,698
Jacob Rockefeller,

236
00:13:04,731 --> 00:13:07,100
the tragic, misunderstood,
genius son of John D.,

237
00:13:07,133 --> 00:13:09,903
believed it was a key to
something far more important,

238
00:13:09,936 --> 00:13:11,839
so much so that he hid its identity

239
00:13:11,872 --> 00:13:14,041
in a riddle on the wall
of his asylum cell.

240
00:13:14,074 --> 00:13:16,777
Now, I've arranged
for a legion of puzzle-solvers

241
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:18,845
to comb through the asylum,
solve the riddle,

242
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:20,147
and then we know what we're stealing.

243
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,782
- Easy, right?
- W-W-Wait.

244
00:13:21,815 --> 00:13:24,118
So you're saying you just
destroyed my brother's life

245
00:13:24,151 --> 00:13:26,587
'cause of something a crazy guy
wrote on a wall

246
00:13:26,619 --> 00:13:27,855
a hundred years ago?

247
00:13:27,888 --> 00:13:29,757
If only it were that simple.

248
00:13:29,789 --> 00:13:31,057
Wh...

249
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:32,726
I still have more questions.

250
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:35,061
Time to practice.

251
00:13:40,768 --> 00:13:42,202
Addison, I've been looking for you.

252
00:13:42,235 --> 00:13:44,739
This guy is about to make it
to the final room.

253
00:13:44,772 --> 00:13:46,307
That was fast.

254
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,807
Thought you'd want to be there.

255
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,310
You're the only one
who knows the answer.

256
00:13:49,342 --> 00:13:51,211
Oh, she's not here.

257
00:13:51,244 --> 00:13:53,013
I was just talking to her a moment ago.

258
00:13:53,047 --> 00:13:54,282
Where could she have gone?

259
00:13:54,315 --> 00:13:55,749
On the floor, assisting with the quest.

260
00:13:55,782 --> 00:13:56,783
Thanks.

261
00:13:56,816 --> 00:13:58,885
I'll head over there now.

262
00:14:04,991 --> 00:14:06,793
- Damn it.
- Come on, Cameron.

263
00:14:06,826 --> 00:14:08,328
I'm not impressed here.

264
00:14:08,361 --> 00:14:09,829
I'll get it.

265
00:14:09,863 --> 00:14:11,766
I never let an audience down before.

266
00:14:11,798 --> 00:14:13,768
So, where'd she go?

267
00:14:13,801 --> 00:14:16,170
I can't tell you that.

268
00:14:16,202 --> 00:14:18,638
You know, I get the funny feeling

269
00:14:18,672 --> 00:14:19,974
that you don't trust me.

270
00:14:20,007 --> 00:14:22,243
What? The first chance you'll get,

271
00:14:22,276 --> 00:14:24,210
you're gonna call the FBI.

272
00:14:24,244 --> 00:14:27,715
And, you know, we just
can't have that, can we?

273
00:14:27,748 --> 00:14:29,584
You really believe in her, don't you?

274
00:14:29,616 --> 00:14:31,718
Yeah. She's going to tear up everything.

275
00:14:31,752 --> 00:14:33,654
The whole rotten system.

276
00:14:33,686 --> 00:14:35,722
She's got the world wired.
Why would she tear it down?

277
00:14:35,755 --> 00:14:37,307
- She believes in a better world.
- Really?

278
00:14:37,332 --> 00:14:38,859
Yeah.

279
00:14:38,892 --> 00:14:40,661
You wanted her to be an anarchist,

280
00:14:40,693 --> 00:14:42,262
- so she's an anarchist.
- That's enough.

281
00:14:42,296 --> 00:14:43,797
She's playing you.

282
00:14:46,966 --> 00:14:48,668
Now, remember.

283
00:14:48,701 --> 00:14:50,370
You need me to do the swap.

284
00:14:50,403 --> 00:14:53,173
Yeah, you're right, so I can't
break your fingers, can I?

285
00:14:55,842 --> 00:14:57,277
How about your face?

286
00:15:10,157 --> 00:15:12,692
Gotta love duct tape.

287
00:15:29,409 --> 00:15:31,111
This is it.

288
00:15:31,144 --> 00:15:34,781
This is the real room.
This is where the patient lived.

289
00:15:38,284 --> 00:15:40,987
God, he hated it here.

290
00:15:41,021 --> 00:15:46,027
There's so much anger on these walls.

291
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:48,162
He didn't think he belonged here.

292
00:15:48,195 --> 00:15:53,167
No patterns, though.
It's just frustration.

293
00:15:57,037 --> 00:15:58,806
Wait.

294
00:16:01,841 --> 00:16:03,744
There it is.

295
00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:09,749
He recreated the nighttime sky.

296
00:16:09,782 --> 00:16:12,085
Huh.

297
00:16:18,325 --> 00:16:21,362
As a kid, I was kind of obsessed
with astronomy.

298
00:16:38,412 --> 00:16:41,047
I did not see that coming.

299
00:16:51,892 --> 00:16:53,960
"AB."

300
00:16:53,994 --> 00:16:56,062
No way.

301
00:16:59,532 --> 00:17:00,801
Hello?

302
00:17:00,834 --> 00:17:01,936
<i>Jordan, it's me.</i>

303
00:17:01,961 --> 00:17:03,262
<i>Don't tell anyone I'm calling.</i>

304
00:17:03,302 --> 00:17:05,005
<i>No! Stop.</i>

305
00:17:05,037 --> 00:17:06,740
Don't say a word.

306
00:17:06,774 --> 00:17:08,508
Who's on the phone?

307
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:10,085
Um...

308
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:12,379
You can talk now.
Just... tell him it's no one.

309
00:17:12,412 --> 00:17:13,847
It's no one.

310
00:17:13,881 --> 00:17:15,216
<i>All right, now, find somewhere private.</i>

311
00:17:15,249 --> 00:17:16,554
No one?

312
00:17:16,585 --> 00:17:18,284
Cameron, what the hell's going on?

313
00:17:18,317 --> 00:17:19,819
<i>I need you to find something for me.</i>

314
00:17:19,853 --> 00:17:21,020
I thought we were finding you.

315
00:17:21,054 --> 00:17:22,355
<i>Kay got Jonathan out and everything.</i>

316
00:17:22,396 --> 00:17:23,776
Whoa. Johnny's out?

317
00:17:23,801 --> 00:17:25,358
Yeah, it's like
a "48 Hours" deal, because,

318
00:17:25,392 --> 00:17:27,094
you know, everyone thinks
the Mystery Woman's

319
00:17:27,126 --> 00:17:28,428
torturing you in a dungeon somewhere.

320
00:17:28,461 --> 00:17:30,530
<i>No, I'm fine.
She wants me to pull a heist.</i>

321
00:17:30,564 --> 00:17:31,748
Then let us rescue...

322
00:17:31,773 --> 00:17:33,500
wait, wait, is this Stockholm syndrome?

323
00:17:33,534 --> 00:17:35,536
<i>No. She's got evidence
that proves Johnny's innocent.</i>

324
00:17:35,568 --> 00:17:37,104
<i>I help her, she gives it to me.</i>

325
00:17:37,136 --> 00:17:39,539
This is insane. We work for the FBI.

326
00:17:39,573 --> 00:17:41,374
They fire you for smoking pot.

327
00:17:41,408 --> 00:17:42,976
<i>Do you think that
the Deception Group survives</i>

328
00:17:43,001 --> 00:17:44,912
<i>- if you help a wanted fugitive?</i>
- Doesn't matter!

329
00:17:44,944 --> 00:17:46,788
The group only exists
to help Johnny, anyway.

330
00:17:46,813 --> 00:17:49,875
<i>What about Kay? She vouched for you.
She'll lose her job.</i>

331
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,051
<i>Man, she's super into
being an FBI agent.</i>

332
00:17:52,085 --> 00:17:53,802
<i>Yeah, well... I don't...</i>

333
00:17:53,827 --> 00:17:55,975
I don't know. All right? I just...

334
00:17:56,022 --> 00:17:58,057
Please, I'm so close to helping Johnny.

335
00:17:58,091 --> 00:17:59,527
Okay. What do you need?

336
00:17:59,568 --> 00:18:01,377
All right, there's
an old photo upstairs.

337
00:18:01,402 --> 00:18:02,930
I need you to find it for me.

338
00:18:02,962 --> 00:18:04,197
<i>Send it to this number.</i>

339
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:06,333
Definitely Stockholm syndrome.

340
00:18:06,365 --> 00:18:07,535
Hey.

341
00:18:07,567 --> 00:18:09,569
Whatcha doing?

342
00:18:09,603 --> 00:18:10,980
Running down leads at Quest Trek.

343
00:18:11,005 --> 00:18:13,007
- What are you doing?
- Worrying, mostly.

344
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:15,108
You don't have to be so defensive.

345
00:18:16,043 --> 00:18:17,343
<i>Is Dina okay?</i>

346
00:18:17,376 --> 00:18:18,945
She's freaking out, man.

347
00:18:18,979 --> 00:18:21,481
<i>I know. I'm sorry.
This will be over soon.</i>

348
00:18:21,515 --> 00:18:24,084
Why did you call me?
Why not Dina or Gunter?

349
00:18:24,116 --> 00:18:25,351
You're the best liar.

350
00:18:25,384 --> 00:18:27,821
Thanks, boss.

351
00:18:27,855 --> 00:18:29,824
Why the extra stars?

352
00:18:29,848 --> 00:18:33,952
They, uh... they make
a larger constellation.

353
00:18:33,993 --> 00:18:36,362
Shaped like a "W."

354
00:18:36,395 --> 00:18:38,464
The Lynx.

355
00:18:38,498 --> 00:18:40,100
That's the answer, isn't it?

356
00:18:40,133 --> 00:18:41,501
Lynx.

357
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:43,370
But you didn't know that until just now.

358
00:18:45,204 --> 00:18:46,239
Thank you, Jonathan.

359
00:18:46,272 --> 00:18:47,974
No, no!

360
00:18:50,344 --> 00:18:51,946
Thank you so much for playing.

361
00:19:04,557 --> 00:19:06,125
Okay. Found it.

362
00:19:06,159 --> 00:19:07,595
What am I looking at?

363
00:19:07,627 --> 00:19:09,195
Man on the right.

364
00:19:09,229 --> 00:19:10,264
Who is he?

365
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:19,239
My great-grandfather.

366
00:19:22,876 --> 00:19:24,467
Uh, family photos.

367
00:19:24,531 --> 00:19:27,013
Bunch of old flyers
advertising the shows.

368
00:19:27,047 --> 00:19:29,443
Aw, you were so cute. Or Jonathan was.

369
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:30,619
<i>Still can't tell the difference.</i>

370
00:19:30,644 --> 00:19:32,986
If it's cute, it's me.
Would you focus, please?

371
00:19:33,019 --> 00:19:35,122
Sorry. Who are these guys, anyways?

372
00:19:35,154 --> 00:19:37,810
My dad told us it's a photo of
our great-grandfather Alistair

373
00:19:37,835 --> 00:19:38,992
and some other guys.

374
00:19:39,026 --> 00:19:40,561
<i>I never paid that much attention.</i>

375
00:19:40,594 --> 00:19:42,318
Hold on. Why does the Mystery Woman

376
00:19:42,343 --> 00:19:44,297
have this photo
of your great-grandfather?

377
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:46,165
I have no idea.

378
00:19:46,199 --> 00:19:50,671
But the violin, the watch, the window...

379
00:19:50,703 --> 00:19:53,039
they're all things
that Bishop stole for her,

380
00:19:53,073 --> 00:19:57,912
so she has gone to great lengths
to recreate this exact moment.

381
00:19:57,944 --> 00:19:59,913
My guess is whatever she's up to,

382
00:19:59,947 --> 00:20:02,283
the answer's in this photo.

383
00:20:06,018 --> 00:20:08,021
<i>All right. Look at the other
guys in the photo,</i>

384
00:20:08,055 --> 00:20:09,422
<i>see what you can figure out.</i>

385
00:20:09,455 --> 00:20:11,257
- I got to go.
- <i>Wait, wait, Cameron.</i>

386
00:20:16,462 --> 00:20:18,065
You all right, bud?

387
00:20:19,967 --> 00:20:21,335
What'd you do to me?

388
00:20:21,367 --> 00:20:23,202
Me? You knocked yourself out.

389
00:20:23,236 --> 00:20:25,382
Y-You trying to escape?

390
00:20:25,429 --> 00:20:27,675
Yeah, I guess I wasn't
trying that hard, huh?

391
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:30,443
It's all right. You're embarrassed.
It's understandable.

392
00:20:30,477 --> 00:20:33,147
Bishop!

393
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:35,416
I'm back!

394
00:20:35,449 --> 00:20:36,951
If I were you,

395
00:20:36,983 --> 00:20:38,685
I'd tell her we were working
this whole time.

396
00:20:47,259 --> 00:20:49,162
That is great work there, Cameron.

397
00:20:49,195 --> 00:20:50,563
You're back.

398
00:20:50,596 --> 00:20:53,633
You figure out what we're
stealing from the auction?

399
00:20:55,402 --> 00:20:58,238
Um, yeah. The Lynx Diamond.

400
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:02,375
Um, Item 71
in the Rockefeller Collection.

401
00:21:02,409 --> 00:21:04,645
Dekker is making a copy
for the swap right now.

402
00:21:04,678 --> 00:21:06,138
How are we getting in?

403
00:21:06,163 --> 00:21:08,044
Well, the guest list is locked down.

404
00:21:08,069 --> 00:21:10,084
Everyone was vetted months ago.

405
00:21:10,116 --> 00:21:12,518
Luckily, there is a man on the list

406
00:21:12,551 --> 00:21:14,864
who's right about your height.

407
00:21:14,889 --> 00:21:16,623
So kill him, take his fingerprints...

408
00:21:16,655 --> 00:21:18,524
Whoa, whoa. We're not killing anybody.

409
00:21:18,565 --> 00:21:21,068
What do you want to do, knock him out,

410
00:21:21,094 --> 00:21:22,805
hope he doesn't call the police
when he wakes up?

411
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:24,852
Well, we're going to get
a little fancier than that,

412
00:21:24,877 --> 00:21:26,913
but, yeah, we're not killing him.

413
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:29,669
This guy... he is known
to the world as an investor,

414
00:21:29,702 --> 00:21:33,140
but he is one of the most ruthless
drug smugglers in France.

415
00:21:33,165 --> 00:21:36,677
All right. Good to know.
We're still not killing him.

416
00:21:38,778 --> 00:21:40,480
He hunts giraffes.

417
00:21:40,514 --> 00:21:42,149
Wait, is that true?

418
00:21:42,182 --> 00:21:44,651
If I say "Yes," can he die?

419
00:21:44,683 --> 00:21:49,255
No. Kill. Ing.

420
00:21:49,288 --> 00:21:50,523
Fine.

421
00:21:50,557 --> 00:21:52,092
What's your plan?

422
00:21:52,132 --> 00:21:53,728
Well, you got his whole schedule
here, right?

423
00:21:53,753 --> 00:21:55,295
So, let's take a look.

424
00:21:57,797 --> 00:22:02,036
There you go. Mr. Morel
has an appointment at...

425
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:10,244
Welcome to the Plaza Spa.

426
00:22:10,277 --> 00:22:11,812
I'm sorry.
We're closing in a few minutes.

427
00:22:11,845 --> 00:22:14,047
We know. We're just here to...

428
00:22:16,615 --> 00:22:19,286
Come on! Seriously?
You can't just do that!

429
00:22:20,423 --> 00:22:22,456
How do you live with so many rules?

430
00:22:22,489 --> 00:22:24,458
Basic morality? Yes, a real burden.

431
00:22:25,491 --> 00:22:27,193
Did you give her a tip, at least?

432
00:22:32,098 --> 00:22:34,400
Good evening. Welcome to the Plaza Spa.

433
00:22:34,433 --> 00:22:36,403
We've been expecting you.

434
00:22:46,313 --> 00:22:49,149
This is not the same mask as usual, no?

435
00:22:49,182 --> 00:22:51,485
Feels... odd.

436
00:22:51,518 --> 00:22:53,487
That's very astute.

437
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:57,490
It has some undertones of, uh, pineapple

438
00:22:57,524 --> 00:22:59,359
with, uh, some seaweed extract.

439
00:22:59,392 --> 00:23:01,695
It's the latest
in rejuvenating face masks.

440
00:23:15,408 --> 00:23:17,644
That brunette in the lobby, huh?

441
00:23:17,676 --> 00:23:20,113
Maybe send her in after you.

442
00:23:20,146 --> 00:23:21,848
Maybe she wants to work for her tip.

443
00:23:23,876 --> 00:23:26,519
She's, um, already gone home
for the day.

444
00:23:26,553 --> 00:23:28,622
Hm, too bad.

445
00:23:33,692 --> 00:23:35,762
You can sit up now.

446
00:23:38,914 --> 00:23:39,907
<i>Allô?</i>

447
00:23:39,932 --> 00:23:41,768
<i>La police est là.</i>

448
00:23:41,854 --> 00:23:43,257
<i>Tu les as laissés entrer?</i>

449
00:23:43,929 --> 00:23:46,535
<i>Je n'ai pas pu les arrêter.</i>

450
00:23:46,619 --> 00:23:48,184
<i>Il faut que tu disparaisses.</i>

451
00:23:48,785 --> 00:23:50,785
<i>J'ai trouvé un hôtel à Newark.</i>

452
00:23:50,824 --> 00:23:52,676
<i>Attends là-bas,
jusqu'à ce que je t'appelle.</i>

453
00:23:53,113 --> 00:23:54,581
<i>Ne quitte pas la chambre.</i>

454
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:56,019
<i>Ne téléphone à personne.</i>

455
00:23:58,652 --> 00:24:00,621
I need new clothes.

456
00:24:00,653 --> 00:24:02,422
As you wish.

457
00:24:10,797 --> 00:24:12,298
Newark?

458
00:24:12,332 --> 00:24:14,234
You really do hate him, huh?

459
00:24:14,267 --> 00:24:16,403
The motel doesn't even have cable.

460
00:24:16,435 --> 00:24:19,772
You see, not killing people
can be fun, too.

461
00:24:19,806 --> 00:24:21,775
Don't get used to it.

462
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:26,970
The auction house thinks they
have an impenetrable security.

463
00:24:26,995 --> 00:24:29,244
No system has been built
to keep Cameron out.

464
00:24:29,269 --> 00:24:31,784
Which is exactly why we'll be
with him every step of the way.

465
00:24:37,232 --> 00:24:38,424
Cameron?

466
00:24:38,458 --> 00:24:39,692
Find anything on the photo?

467
00:24:39,726 --> 00:24:41,121
<i>Yeah. All of those old white guys</i>

468
00:24:41,184 --> 00:24:42,796
in the picture with Alistair
were billionaires...

469
00:24:42,828 --> 00:24:44,278
Clarence Abernathy, Earl Covington,

470
00:24:44,303 --> 00:24:45,932
Hugh DuPont, and John Rockefeller.

471
00:24:45,966 --> 00:24:48,869
Rockefeller? It all connects.

472
00:24:48,902 --> 00:24:50,604
The diamond is just another
piece of the puzzle.

473
00:24:50,636 --> 00:24:51,938
Only one I can't find...
the guy at the desk.

474
00:24:51,971 --> 00:24:54,807
- He's a mystery.
- All right. I'll check in later.

475
00:24:54,841 --> 00:24:56,343
I knew it.

476
00:25:02,045 --> 00:25:03,279
All right. Okay.

477
00:25:04,491 --> 00:25:06,958
Don't do anything rash.
Remember the jewel.

478
00:25:06,983 --> 00:25:09,475
- You still need me.
- What the hell is going on?

479
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,725
Cameron was making a call.

480
00:25:11,758 --> 00:25:14,327
The FBI are probably
on their way right now.

481
00:25:14,361 --> 00:25:16,230
I don't know what he's talking about.

482
00:25:16,262 --> 00:25:17,697
He had a phone.

483
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:18,765
Really?

484
00:25:18,797 --> 00:25:20,968
Gun.

485
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,435
Search him.

486
00:25:22,469 --> 00:25:24,770
Please, allow me.

487
00:25:34,279 --> 00:25:36,249
Oh. Tickles!

488
00:25:42,422 --> 00:25:44,624
See? No phone.

489
00:25:47,426 --> 00:25:49,895
He is a magician. He hid it.

490
00:25:49,929 --> 00:25:51,476
Oh, come on. He's lying.

491
00:25:51,501 --> 00:25:53,421
He's just been after me ever
since I tranq'd him earlier.

492
00:25:53,446 --> 00:25:54,634
What?

493
00:25:54,668 --> 00:25:55,902
He didn't.

494
00:25:55,934 --> 00:25:58,871
He had a phone and he called someone!

495
00:25:58,904 --> 00:26:00,039
Enough.

496
00:26:00,073 --> 00:26:01,742
Did you call the FBI?

497
00:26:01,775 --> 00:26:05,156
Look, I would rat you guys out
in a second

498
00:26:05,181 --> 00:26:06,211
if it weren't for the fact

499
00:26:06,236 --> 00:26:09,446
that you have the one thing
that could exonerate Jonathan.

500
00:26:09,727 --> 00:26:13,988
Like I said, I will do
anything for my brother.

501
00:26:16,722 --> 00:26:18,791
Prove it.

502
00:26:20,393 --> 00:26:21,795
Kill him.

503
00:26:21,827 --> 00:26:22,962
What?

504
00:26:24,574 --> 00:26:26,209
You can't be serious.

505
00:26:26,234 --> 00:26:27,425
I...

506
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:30,836
I did everything that you asked.

507
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:32,306
I killed for you.

508
00:26:32,338 --> 00:26:33,673
Don't.

509
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:38,045
You bitch.

510
00:26:38,077 --> 00:26:39,980
You said you'd do anything.

511
00:26:41,748 --> 00:26:43,049
Pull the trigger.

512
00:26:45,976 --> 00:26:48,989
- This is insane.
- This is... This is a test, right?!

513
00:26:49,021 --> 00:26:50,589
This is a test?!

514
00:26:50,623 --> 00:26:52,926
I told him to guard you
and he failed me.

515
00:26:52,959 --> 00:26:54,960
Can't trust him.

516
00:26:55,548 --> 00:26:57,863
He betrayed you, by the way.

517
00:26:57,896 --> 00:27:01,000
- Go ahead.
- Listen, he will try to kill you again.

518
00:27:01,034 --> 00:27:04,738
And if you're dead,
who's going to save Jonathan?

519
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:07,540
Killing him is the only way
to get what you want.

520
00:27:07,574 --> 00:27:11,577
Remember. My tests are always real.

521
00:27:17,584 --> 00:27:19,820
I can't do it. Get me out.

522
00:27:19,853 --> 00:27:21,822
Dad sealed the top.

523
00:27:21,855 --> 00:27:23,953
You have to open it from the inside.

524
00:27:23,978 --> 00:27:25,950
It's okay. You can do this.

525
00:27:25,975 --> 00:27:28,745
I'm not going anywhere.

526
00:27:28,795 --> 00:27:30,564
Why is he doing this?

527
00:27:30,596 --> 00:27:32,965
He wants you to be the best.

528
00:27:32,999 --> 00:27:34,916
I don't want to be the best.

529
00:27:34,941 --> 00:27:36,503
I'm not. I can't.

530
00:27:36,536 --> 00:27:37,903
No, you are.

531
00:27:37,937 --> 00:27:40,107
You're amazing and you can do this.

532
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:42,142
Just listen to the tapping.

533
00:27:42,174 --> 00:27:43,844
I'm right here.

534
00:27:43,876 --> 00:27:46,579
I will always be here.

535
00:27:52,018 --> 00:27:53,653
Time to decide, Cameron.

536
00:27:53,685 --> 00:27:54,920
What are you willing to do?

537
00:27:54,953 --> 00:27:56,589
Yeah, Cameron.

538
00:28:08,701 --> 00:28:09,937
I can't.

539
00:28:12,228 --> 00:28:15,040
I told you. It was a test.

540
00:28:25,184 --> 00:28:27,887
I told you. Your life is on the line.

541
00:28:30,789 --> 00:28:32,584
Time for hair and makeup.

542
00:28:35,862 --> 00:28:37,631
Please dispose of Bishop's body.

543
00:28:40,967 --> 00:28:43,903
Try not to sweat too much.

544
00:29:10,497 --> 00:29:11,832
He's ready.

545
00:29:27,514 --> 00:29:29,883
Welcome, Mr. Morel.

546
00:29:31,784 --> 00:29:33,085
I'm in.

547
00:29:34,662 --> 00:29:36,590
Copy that. On my way.

548
00:29:36,623 --> 00:29:38,624
Good evening.

549
00:29:45,386 --> 00:29:46,822
I'm in, too.

550
00:29:46,847 --> 00:29:48,883
<i>Great.</i>

551
00:29:49,201 --> 00:29:51,171
Remember, you're doing this
to save Jonathan.

552
00:29:51,203 --> 00:29:52,905
<i>Really? You're giving me a pep talk.</i>

553
00:29:52,939 --> 00:29:54,740
Two hours ago, you murdered a man.

554
00:29:54,781 --> 00:29:56,149
<i>I have layers.</i>

555
00:29:56,174 --> 00:29:58,511
No, you have a personality disorder.

556
00:29:58,545 --> 00:30:00,279
<i>Addison, the nerdy game designer.</i>

557
00:30:00,313 --> 00:30:01,633
Mary, the receptionist.

558
00:30:01,658 --> 00:30:03,717
Bishop's anarchist.

559
00:30:03,749 --> 00:30:06,018
<i>Even M.W., the brilliant illusionist.</i>

560
00:30:06,051 --> 00:30:07,620
<i>None of them are real.</i>

561
00:30:08,621 --> 00:30:10,584
I'm not even sure there is
a real you under all the lies.

562
00:30:10,609 --> 00:30:13,059
Oh, my God. Cameron Black.

563
00:30:15,662 --> 00:30:17,264
Jonathan and Kay are here.

564
00:30:17,297 --> 00:30:19,065
Oh, yeah. Your brother seems to think

565
00:30:19,097 --> 00:30:20,547
he needs to save you from me.

566
00:30:20,572 --> 00:30:22,313
This coin is my lucky coin.

567
00:30:22,338 --> 00:30:26,423
I'll put it in this hand.
I can make it disappear.

568
00:30:26,448 --> 00:30:28,705
I can also just make it reappear.

569
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:30,126
Do that one more time for me.

570
00:30:30,151 --> 00:30:31,455
That's got to be tough.

571
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,728
To help your brother, you have
to betray your partner.

572
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,023
She believed me, trusted me.

573
00:30:36,048 --> 00:30:38,151
And he's your brother.

574
00:30:38,183 --> 00:30:40,153
We're about to start the bidding.

575
00:30:42,709 --> 00:30:43,957
I have to do this.

576
00:30:43,989 --> 00:30:45,291
That's right.

577
00:30:45,325 --> 00:30:48,501
Get the diamond
and Johnny gets out of jail.

578
00:30:48,526 --> 00:30:50,705
Please everyone, grab your paddles.

579
00:30:54,334 --> 00:30:56,635
- Did you see that?
- See what?

580
00:30:56,669 --> 00:30:58,305
The guard put something
on the communication box.

581
00:30:58,337 --> 00:30:59,338
I'll check it out.

582
00:30:59,372 --> 00:31:01,708
Next up for bidding,

583
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:04,643
from the Rockefeller jewelry
collection, number 71,

584
00:31:04,676 --> 00:31:05,978
the Lynx Diamond.

585
00:31:06,011 --> 00:31:07,681
Here we go.

586
00:31:09,949 --> 00:31:12,786
We'll start the bidding at $1 million.

587
00:31:12,818 --> 00:31:14,186
We have $1 million over here.

588
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:18,057
<i>1.1. We have 1.2. 1.2 over there.</i>

589
00:31:18,091 --> 00:31:19,726
1.3.

590
00:31:19,758 --> 00:31:21,795
$2 million? Do we have 2.1?

591
00:31:21,827 --> 00:31:22,938
2.1?

592
00:31:22,963 --> 00:31:24,864
- What are you doing?
- 2.1 million.

593
00:31:24,896 --> 00:31:27,300
- <i>Jonathan's bidding.</i>
- Why?

594
00:31:28,867 --> 00:31:30,604
He's having fun.

595
00:31:30,636 --> 00:31:32,204
Now it's your turn.

596
00:31:35,625 --> 00:31:38,352
Uh, guys. Guys, I'm losing cameras.

597
00:31:38,377 --> 00:31:39,845
Something's happening.

598
00:31:39,878 --> 00:31:41,080
$2.4 million?

599
00:31:41,114 --> 00:31:43,616
3.5. Do we have 4?

600
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:45,719
$4 million.

601
00:31:45,751 --> 00:31:46,885
$4.1 million.

602
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:48,711
<i>Cameras are down. Get ready.</i>

603
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:51,080
- Sorry, Kay.
- Don't think about her.

604
00:31:51,105 --> 00:31:52,283
<i>Focus on your brother.</i>

605
00:31:52,325 --> 00:31:54,361
- Get out of my head.
- 4.7.

606
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,933
$5 million.

607
00:31:55,958 --> 00:31:57,794
$5 million from bidder number 12.

608
00:31:57,819 --> 00:31:59,999
<i>She's just a fed. Forget about her.</i>

609
00:32:00,025 --> 00:32:02,003
- Do we have 5.1?
- It's him.

610
00:32:02,028 --> 00:32:04,011
- 5.1.
- Jonathan's onto me.

611
00:32:04,036 --> 00:32:05,714
<i>Then be fast. Here go the lights.</i>

612
00:32:05,739 --> 00:32:09,843
In five, four, three, two, one.

613
00:32:32,741 --> 00:32:35,001
Go! Go! This way!

614
00:32:36,235 --> 00:32:38,738
Where's the diamond? Did you get it?

615
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:43,942
I didn't. Johnny was too fast.

616
00:32:43,976 --> 00:32:45,311
Go to plan B.

617
00:32:45,344 --> 00:32:47,080
We didn't prep a plan B.

618
00:32:47,113 --> 00:32:48,314
I did.

619
00:32:48,346 --> 00:32:50,140
Tallis, Dekker, head to the vault.

620
00:32:50,165 --> 00:32:51,976
No! They're onto us. We have to run.

621
00:32:52,009 --> 00:32:54,327
I'm not leaving here
without that diamond.

622
00:32:54,353 --> 00:32:57,222
And I will kill anyone
who gets in my way.

623
00:33:06,254 --> 00:33:08,356
Jordan.

624
00:33:08,539 --> 00:33:10,903
Jordan, stop.

625
00:33:10,937 --> 00:33:12,372
Jordan, it's me.

626
00:33:12,404 --> 00:33:13,807
Cameron.

627
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:15,841
You're the French dude?

628
00:33:16,924 --> 00:33:18,444
You're helping her steal the diamond?

629
00:33:18,478 --> 00:33:19,979
I couldn't go through with it.

630
00:33:20,011 --> 00:33:22,081
- Why?
- Because of Kay.

631
00:33:22,114 --> 00:33:23,652
Because of what you said earlier.

632
00:33:23,677 --> 00:33:25,384
Cool. But wh... what did I say?

633
00:33:25,418 --> 00:33:27,921
Never mind. I need to get
everyone away from the vault.

634
00:33:27,953 --> 00:33:29,388
Okay. Just... Just tell them
what's going on.

635
00:33:29,422 --> 00:33:31,490
The minute M.W. figures out
I'm working against her,

636
00:33:31,524 --> 00:33:32,926
she starts killing people.

637
00:33:32,959 --> 00:33:34,193
We need to get our team out of here.

638
00:33:34,227 --> 00:33:36,150
Got it.

639
00:33:36,175 --> 00:33:38,264
Uh, punch me in the face.

640
00:33:38,297 --> 00:33:39,399
What?

641
00:33:39,432 --> 00:33:41,867
Punch me in the face!

642
00:33:44,103 --> 00:33:47,646
Guys, guys? Jordan needs help.
He's... He's in trouble.

643
00:33:47,671 --> 00:33:50,008
He's... He's on the east side hallway.

644
00:33:50,041 --> 00:33:51,410
We're on our way.

645
00:33:51,443 --> 00:33:53,078
Jordan!

646
00:33:53,112 --> 00:33:54,698
Aah, that French guy can punch.

647
00:33:54,723 --> 00:33:55,854
Where did he go?!

648
00:33:55,879 --> 00:33:58,151
Uh, uh, that way, towards the exit.

649
00:33:58,176 --> 00:34:00,690
The diamond's in the vault,
but they can't close the door

650
00:34:00,715 --> 00:34:03,089
so we're going to guard it.
I got five men here.

651
00:34:03,122 --> 00:34:05,425
Five? No, no, Mike.

652
00:34:05,458 --> 00:34:08,094
No. No, that's wrong.
There's only three.

653
00:34:08,127 --> 00:34:09,763
There's only three guards in that area.

654
00:34:11,196 --> 00:34:12,164
Hey.

655
00:34:15,401 --> 00:34:17,236
Get the car.

656
00:34:24,276 --> 00:34:28,380
You have the diamond.
Now give me the video.

657
00:34:31,149 --> 00:34:32,384
Deal's a deal.

658
00:34:36,555 --> 00:34:38,791
I knew I couldn't trust you.

659
00:35:00,613 --> 00:35:03,950
Please, Cameron.
You have to get out of this.

660
00:35:03,982 --> 00:35:05,551
I need you.

661
00:35:12,462 --> 00:35:14,558
<i>Depressurization will begin</i>

662
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:16,392
<i>in 15 seconds.</i>

663
00:35:24,729 --> 00:35:27,031
Henri! Henri! Get up!

664
00:35:31,121 --> 00:35:32,690
Come on!

665
00:35:34,775 --> 00:35:36,253
Henri!

666
00:35:40,556 --> 00:35:41,914
We found it. Can't open the door.

667
00:35:41,939 --> 00:35:43,274
I can't just let him die.

668
00:35:43,299 --> 00:35:45,188
That bastard Henri deserves to die.

669
00:35:45,213 --> 00:35:46,715
It's not Henri.

670
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:47,975
What?

671
00:35:52,397 --> 00:35:53,966
Cam!

672
00:35:55,567 --> 00:35:57,970
Cameron!

673
00:36:03,042 --> 00:36:04,531
We're locked out of the system.

674
00:36:04,556 --> 00:36:07,613
There's four hydraulic dials
on the other side of the door.

675
00:36:07,647 --> 00:36:09,114
We have to turn them off

676
00:36:09,147 --> 00:36:11,149
and then turn the override wheel.

677
00:36:13,185 --> 00:36:15,355
Cam! Cam!

678
00:36:15,388 --> 00:36:17,023
Everybody back.

679
00:36:17,055 --> 00:36:18,364
What? That won't work!

680
00:36:18,389 --> 00:36:20,825
It's worth a try. Get down!

681
00:36:26,329 --> 00:36:28,595
Come on, Cam!

682
00:36:30,335 --> 00:36:32,671
Cameron!

683
00:36:32,705 --> 00:36:35,008
- Come on!
- That's it, come on!

684
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,109
Cam! Cameron!

685
00:36:37,134 --> 00:36:38,773
Come on!

686
00:36:38,798 --> 00:36:41,163
Cam, Cam, turn the dials,
then turn the wheel.

687
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:42,649
That's it. Come on, Cam.

688
00:36:42,682 --> 00:36:44,417
Turn the dial, then turn the wheel.

689
00:37:12,979 --> 00:37:14,580
Listen to Jonathan's voice! Come on!

690
00:37:14,613 --> 00:37:17,238
Cameron!

691
00:37:17,383 --> 00:37:19,352
- Cameron!
- Cameron, get up!

692
00:37:21,486 --> 00:37:22,955
Cameron!

693
00:37:22,988 --> 00:37:24,557
Come on! Come on!

694
00:37:28,739 --> 00:37:30,995
That's it. Cameron, turn the wheel.

695
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:32,729
Come on.

696
00:37:32,762 --> 00:37:35,031
Cam! Cam!

697
00:37:35,885 --> 00:37:37,657
No!

698
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:41,063
That's it. Come on. Cam. Cameron.

699
00:37:41,379 --> 00:37:43,345
Cam!

700
00:37:48,828 --> 00:37:51,710
Cameron!

701
00:37:56,491 --> 00:37:58,842
Cameron! Cameron! Can you hear me?!

702
00:38:17,855 --> 00:38:19,089
Back up!

703
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,166
Back up!

704
00:38:27,285 --> 00:38:29,642
Come on. You're all right.

705
00:38:29,667 --> 00:38:31,323
You're all right.

706
00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:34,792
I'm sorry.

707
00:38:40,548 --> 00:38:43,711
It's okay. You did it.

708
00:38:43,819 --> 00:38:46,556
You're not trying to do that anymore.

709
00:38:58,582 --> 00:39:00,665
Last taste of freedom?

710
00:39:00,762 --> 00:39:02,611
Hmm.

711
00:39:02,689 --> 00:39:05,314
They don't have gourmet mustard
in prison, so...

712
00:39:05,339 --> 00:39:06,674
Well, I stocked up.

713
00:39:06,706 --> 00:39:09,535
You know, for when you get back.

714
00:39:11,997 --> 00:39:13,899
Thanks.

715
00:39:16,328 --> 00:39:18,230
So, look, about Mike...

716
00:39:18,263 --> 00:39:19,730
I get it.

717
00:39:19,771 --> 00:39:22,308
He's a good guy.

718
00:39:24,502 --> 00:39:26,304
Superb FBI agent.

719
00:39:26,329 --> 00:39:27,697
Jonathan...

720
00:39:27,739 --> 00:39:29,074
Jonathan.

721
00:39:30,542 --> 00:39:32,844
I'm sorry. Time to go.

722
00:39:32,877 --> 00:39:35,990
Is Cam okay? Can I see him?

723
00:39:36,015 --> 00:39:39,319
Yeah, he's fine, but the FBI
has a few questions for him.

724
00:39:42,248 --> 00:39:44,550
Before we start,
"I did it for my brother"

725
00:39:44,583 --> 00:39:46,586
is not going to hold up in court.

726
00:39:46,619 --> 00:39:50,823
I know. I did it for my brother.

727
00:39:55,994 --> 00:39:57,964
Let's start at the beginning.

728
00:39:59,998 --> 00:40:01,634
You were abducted.

729
00:40:01,666 --> 00:40:04,302
You feared for your life.

730
00:40:04,335 --> 00:40:06,638
And I could have escaped
a hundred times.

731
00:40:07,804 --> 00:40:09,273
Instead, I lied to you

732
00:40:09,298 --> 00:40:11,534
and betrayed everyone who trusted me.

733
00:40:11,677 --> 00:40:13,579
Jonathan's still in prison.

734
00:40:15,947 --> 00:40:18,618
She told me at the beginning,
she warned me.

735
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:21,353
She'll always win.

736
00:40:21,386 --> 00:40:25,590
Cameron, you helped to steal
a diamond worth millions.

737
00:40:25,623 --> 00:40:27,592
You're in a lot of trouble.

738
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:30,529
I made a lot of mistakes.

739
00:40:32,063 --> 00:40:34,032
But I didn't do that.

740
00:40:49,095 --> 00:40:52,198
So, how much trouble is he in?
Slap on the wrist or...

741
00:40:52,223 --> 00:40:53,525
do I get a new cellie?

742
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:55,118
Somewhere in-between.

743
00:40:55,386 --> 00:40:57,656
Thanks for getting me out.

744
00:40:57,681 --> 00:40:59,650
Next time, it will be for good.

745
00:41:01,326 --> 00:41:03,495
All right.

746
00:41:03,529 --> 00:41:05,364
Hey, Jonathan.

747
00:41:05,397 --> 00:41:08,034
In the ambulance, Cameron
mentioned Reykjavík.

748
00:41:08,067 --> 00:41:09,935
He thought it might be
a riddle or something

749
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:11,703
the Mystery Woman
wanted him to remember.

750
00:41:11,737 --> 00:41:13,039
Do you have any idea what?

751
00:41:13,072 --> 00:41:17,643
Uh, Cameron never made it to Reykjavík.

752
00:41:17,676 --> 00:41:20,813
He got sick in Glasgow,
and I went on without him.

753
00:41:21,947 --> 00:41:23,449
What does that mean?

754
00:41:25,451 --> 00:41:26,786
Nothing.

755
00:41:26,819 --> 00:41:28,987
Don't make sense.

756
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:30,855
Okay.

757
00:41:30,889 --> 00:41:32,925
Stay safe, Jonathan.

758
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:53,576
Aren't you Cameron Black?

759
00:41:54,045 --> 00:41:56,081
Shouldn't you be downstairs?

760
00:41:56,114 --> 00:41:58,483
They don't need me for this part.

761
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:01,619
This is the real show, anyway. Look up.

762
00:42:06,391 --> 00:42:09,162
He never told me his name.

763
00:42:16,994 --> 00:42:19,420
You chose the wrong brother.

764
00:42:26,014 --> 00:42:31,586
