<i>we're all set up.</i>

3
00:00:07,967 --> 00:00:08,967
May I please have a green light?

4
00:00:08,968 --> 00:00:11,219
No maiming or torture

5
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:12,263
or setting anyone on fire.

6
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:18,310
What the shit?!

7
00:00:19,478 --> 00:00:21,396
<i>You have restored
a wholesome image.</i>

8
00:00:21,397 --> 00:00:24,691
The board wants to make you
cocaptain of The Seven.

9
00:00:24,692 --> 00:00:27,068
<i>I am just a man
who fell for the wrong woman.</i>

{\an8}<i>I am excited for everyone

11
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:31,281
I'm not just like
the rest of you.

12
00:00:31,282 --> 00:00:33,158
I am better! I'm the real hero.

13
00:00:33,159 --> 00:00:35,076
<i>White males in
the Rust Belt loved your speech.</i>

14
00:00:35,077 --> 00:00:36,327
Fuck yes!

15
00:00:36,328 --> 00:00:37,579
He was just
walking home from work.

16
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:38,997
Blue Hawk
curb-stomped him so hard,

17
00:00:38,998 --> 00:00:40,290
it cracked the pavement.

18
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:41,666
They need you to speak up.

19
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:44,294
I'm Michael Jordan.
I'm not Malcolm X.

20

<i>I could bring
good people into The Seven.</i>

21

<i>He's lost his mind.</i>

<i>As long as I'm CEO,

<i>Neuman's the head popper.</i>

25

<i>Pretty much

26

<i>I thought we could fight Vought</i>

00:00:56,766 --> 00:00:57,766
<i>the right way, but we can't.</i>

28
00:00:57,767 --> 00:00:58,975

29

<i>I think I have something.</i>

30
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:01,019
What's B.C.L. RED?

31
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,061
Some kind of weapon.

32
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,229

You knew and you never
said a fucking word.

One of them websites.

- Boners for days.

Gunpowder's dead.

00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,398
We know what we need to know.
End of.

82
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:12,942
Wait, wait, you-you-you...

83
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:15,403
you killed... Gunpowder?

84

With powers? You...

85
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:19,657
You had superpowers?

86
00:03:19,658 --> 00:03:22,619
Oh, look, let's just
give it a rest, all right?

87
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,078
It's over. I'm fine.

88
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:25,831
Wait, wait,
d-d-do the others know?

89
00:03:28,584 --> 00:03:29,793
No, they do not.

90
00:03:31,003 --> 00:03:35,174
And if they find out,
I'll put you in a fucking coma.

91
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,555
Yeah, no, you're right.

92
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:44,725
You seem t-totally fine.

93
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:53,191
So, <i>The New York Times</i> viciously
attacked your birthday telecast,

94
00:03:53,192 --> 00:03:54,609
saying, and I quote,

95
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:57,820
"It's scary to see a man
that strong that riled up."

96
00:03:57,821 --> 00:04:00,156
Yeah, well, I am riled up. I am.

97
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:04,869
I am sick and tired of the lies
peddled by the mainstream media.

98
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:05,995
Look, the real question
here, Cam:

99
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:08,623
Who's behind these attacks?

100
00:04:08,624 --> 00:04:10,458
Who is trying to silence me?

101
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:13,127
Maybe the rich and powerful
forces you mentioned

102
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:15,797
in your, I thought,
courageous speech.

103
00:04:15,798 --> 00:04:17,757
- Thank you.
- Who are they?

104
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:19,175
Well, look, for the most part,

105
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:20,343
they're people
you've never heard of,

106
00:04:20,344 --> 00:04:22,345
but they operate in the shadows,

107
00:04:22,346 --> 00:04:25,348
and they are the ones
pulling the strings.

108
00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:28,559
And unfortunately,
they're everywhere.

109
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,353
Even inside of Vought.

110
00:04:30,354 --> 00:04:33,064
Sorry, they were
out of oat milk.

111
00:04:33,065 --> 00:04:35,400
Uh, what are you doing here?

112
00:04:35,401 --> 00:04:36,734
I can't drop by on a whim?

113
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,570
You never do anything on a whim.

114
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:41,531
You can't be serious.

115
00:04:41,532 --> 00:04:43,908
We never go after Homelander.

116
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:45,451
It is practically
federal policy.

117
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:47,870
No one is going after anyone.

118
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:50,957
Just a gentle reminder
of who's in charge.

119
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:54,711
I assume you saw him
on <i>Cameron Coleman</i> this morning?

120
00:04:54,712 --> 00:04:56,087
He's testing boundaries.

121
00:04:56,088 --> 00:04:57,755
And when that happens,
you have to discipline them

122
00:04:57,756 --> 00:05:00,216
like, well, like a parent would.

123
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:01,259
Like with Zoe.

124
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,885
Zoe won't rip my spine out.

125
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:04,387
Let's not overreact.

126
00:05:04,388 --> 00:05:06,597
He used foul language
during that birthday rant.

127
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:08,224
So you make a public statement.

128
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:12,020
A stern reprimand,
some FCC fines, nothing serious.

129
00:05:12,021 --> 00:05:16,107
Just a reminder that
he can't get away with anything.

130
00:05:16,108 --> 00:05:17,900
He's gonna love that.

131
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:19,903
You'll be perfectly safe.

132
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:23,239
And Zoe?

133
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,615
Especially Zoe.

134
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:27,410
Homelander might bark a little,
but he won't bite.

135
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:30,163
He's still afraid of me.

136
00:05:30,164 --> 00:05:34,501
I would never let
anything happen to you or Zoe.

137
00:05:35,878 --> 00:05:37,545
You know that, right?

138
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:39,715
Yeah, yes, of course.

139
00:05:53,312 --> 00:05:54,396
Gents.

140
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:05,782
Hello, hello.

141
00:06:05,783 --> 00:06:07,283
You must be Nina.

142
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:09,660
William Butcher.

143
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:13,832
Sergei, why you not tell me
he's so delicious?

144
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:17,627
I am making some pelmeni
if you want.

145
00:06:17,628 --> 00:06:20,129
Of course, I cannot
cook like my Sergei.

146
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:21,881
His cassoulet?

147
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:23,758
Made me come.

148
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,512
I'm still a bit upset
you stole him from me.

149
00:06:27,513 --> 00:06:30,516
Well, we offered him
a better home, didn't we?

150
00:06:32,518 --> 00:06:35,979
So, to what do I owe
this pleasure?

151
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,816
I'm after
a particular bit of tech.

152
00:06:39,817 --> 00:06:42,235
A weapon, you'll not be
surprised to hear.

153
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:44,278
And I thought you
and your mates at the Kremlin

154
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:46,280
might be able to help.

155
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:47,573
That's giving me some credit.

156
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:48,866
Where it's due, love.

157
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:51,828
Way I heard it,
you filmed a couple of punters

158
00:06:51,829 --> 00:06:53,162
from the Interior Ministry

159
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:56,458
having a right old frolic
under your golden shower.

160
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,503
That's to cover Cherie's debt.

161
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:04,675
Plus a hundred grand
for your troubles.

162
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:12,890
Does your Bureau know

163
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:15,560
you're giving me
their nice clean money?

164
00:07:15,561 --> 00:07:17,854
Well, it's the
U.S. Government, love.

165
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:19,523
They'll just print more.

166
00:07:20,566 --> 00:07:21,942
Hmm.

167
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:27,822
Yeah, the money is
good for my trouble,

168
00:07:27,823 --> 00:07:30,158
but what about
my pain and suffering?

169
00:07:30,159 --> 00:07:34,830
Then there is
the time spent and my stress.

170
00:07:35,873 --> 00:07:39,626
I have been sleeping so poorly.

171
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:45,799
And what would ease your pain?

172
00:07:47,593 --> 00:07:48,593
Cherie.

173
00:07:48,594 --> 00:07:50,553
<i>Non.</i> No way.

174
00:07:50,554 --> 00:07:52,848
That is all I want.

175
00:07:53,891 --> 00:07:56,726
You and I, we're just
getting started, dear love.

176
00:07:56,727 --> 00:08:00,104
Don't tell me
there ain't no, uh...

177
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:01,481

- Frenchie.

179

It's time we let the world know.

180
00:08:26,924 --> 00:08:30,468
Starlight and I are in love.

- Um, tonight.

183
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:43,648

184
00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:44,857
You agreed to this?

185
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:48,277
It's like what you said, Hughie:

186
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:49,403
whatever it takes.

187
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:50,989
This is...

188
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:53,992
This is what it takes.

189
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:56,453
Hey.

190
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:01,874
It's gonna be okay.

191
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,876
Really.

192
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:06,046
Let me save you for once.

193
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:12,511
Hughie.

194
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:16,390
This has to work.

195
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:22,520
It'll work.

196
00:09:22,521 --> 00:09:23,647
What'll work?

197
00:09:25,357 --> 00:09:28,985
Uh, my VoughtSonic
speaker setup.

198
00:09:28,986 --> 00:09:31,112
I'm sorry, uh,
how did you get in?

199
00:09:31,113 --> 00:09:32,114
I have a key.

200
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:36,033
Yeah, I got to keep an eye
on my best girl, right?

201
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:38,245
By the way, you're
a sound sleeper, Starlight.

202
00:09:39,663 --> 00:09:40,830
Oh, look at you two.

203
00:09:40,831 --> 00:09:42,456
I'm kidding.

204
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:44,292
Come on, lighten up.

205
00:09:44,293 --> 00:09:45,543
I'm joking.

206
00:09:45,544 --> 00:09:48,255
But we got to go. Running late.

207

<i>Rolling Stone</i> cover shoot.
Hot Issue.

208
00:09:53,677 --> 00:09:55,386
We got "Hottest Ship."

209
00:09:55,387 --> 00:09:57,221
Don't you worry, Hughie.

210
00:09:57,222 --> 00:10:01,268
This little love affair
is strictly for the cameras.

211
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:05,229
Although that's how
me and Maeve started out,

212
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,774
and that got quite spicy.

213
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,610
Yeah, I'm not kidding, man.

214
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,071
Let's just say that
Maeve can bend a steel pipe

215
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:15,699
without using her hands.

216
00:10:19,036 --> 00:10:20,202
What's she like?

217
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:21,621
She a good fuck?

218
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:29,587
Whoa.

219
00:10:29,588 --> 00:10:33,716
Touch him
or anyone he cares about,

220
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:35,551
and I'll walk.

221
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:39,181
And I'll take
my approval points with me.

[clicks tongue, whispers] Women.

223
00:10:46,188 --> 00:10:47,271
I'm kidding.

224
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:49,066
You really need
to lighten up, guys.

225
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,526
Come on, Starlight.

226
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:54,028
Mario's waiting.

227
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:55,530
I'll call you later.

228
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:02,495
Blue Hawk?

229
00:11:02,496 --> 00:11:03,954
- Mm-hmm.
- Who cares about Blue Hawk?

230
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:05,748
He's way below your pay grade.

231
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:07,375
He's brutalizing
Black people in Trenton.

232
00:11:07,376 --> 00:11:09,502
I think Vought has
a responsibility here.

233
00:11:09,503 --> 00:11:11,587
Mm-hmm.

234
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:13,422
Right.

235
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:14,965
Wait, you're serious?

236
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:16,842
- I just want to talk to him.
- Of course.

237
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:19,804
Social justice is
so important around here.

238
00:11:19,805 --> 00:11:21,639
- Since when?
- A-Train,

239
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,933
"Black Lives Matter"
is my favorite hashtag.

240
00:11:23,934 --> 00:11:26,311
My Insta?
Nothing but black screens.

241
00:11:27,813 --> 00:11:29,980
And look at you.
You look amazing!

242
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:31,857
This whole new thing you did,

243
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:35,778
that is exactly what inspired
this entire campaign.

244
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:37,113
To be silent is to be complicit.

245
00:11:37,114 --> 00:11:38,197
So let's shoot the spot,

246
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:39,865
and we'll chat about
Blue Hawk later.

247
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:41,033
When, Ashley?

248
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:42,744
Later, A-Train.

249
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:46,248
<i>And action on Dolly.</i>

250
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:51,544
We're here today for peace
and love and prosperity!

251
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:53,337
Where all those people going?

252
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:54,756
There's a protest
down the street.

253
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:02,012
A-Train, where you going?
Almost ready to shoot.

254
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:03,682
This is important.

255
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:40,342
We got to listen to each other.

256
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:42,721
A-Train's Turbo Rush
Energy Drink.

257
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:54,982
Like, uh, four
or five days maybe.

258
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:56,817
<i>A hell of a week
to fall off your Peloton.</i>

259
00:12:56,818 --> 00:12:58,527
Look, I'm popping Vicodin
like they're Tic Tacs,

260
00:12:58,528 --> 00:12:59,695
and my arm still kills.

261
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:01,489
Uh, I'm no good to you, Vicky.

262
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,115
Really. <i>- Fine. Okay.</i>

263
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,951
<i>Just stay in bed,
get some rest, get better.</i>

264
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:07,495
That's exactly what I'm doing.

265
00:13:07,496 --> 00:13:08,704
Thanks, Vick.

266
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:10,664
First time flying private, kid?

267
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:13,667
First time out of the country.

268
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:16,462
Five years, I work for Nina,
23 contracts.

269
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:18,589
Never she's giving
anything away.

270
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:19,965
What is this?

271
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:22,719
Now she giving us the plane,
those shiny passports?

272
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:26,222
You think
he promised her Cherie?

273
00:13:26,223 --> 00:13:28,349
Fucking hell, Frenchie.

274
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:31,143
What kind of monster
do you think I am, eh?

275
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:32,603
Enjoy.

276
00:13:32,604 --> 00:13:33,980
Pretend you're on <i>Entourage.</i>

277
00:13:36,191 --> 00:13:38,026
<i>Merde.</i>

278
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:43,156
<i>Entourage</i> is but for
the stupid and the damned.

279
00:13:52,249 --> 00:13:54,041
Hi.

280
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:55,334
Can we talk?

281
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:57,796
- No.
- Maeve, please.

282
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:07,054
I heard that
you stopped training.

283
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:08,514
Yeah?

284
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:11,433
You also hear that I wake up
six days a week hungover,

285
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:13,937
tits-deep in
some random fuck pile?

286
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:18,274
People think
what I want them to.

287
00:14:18,275 --> 00:14:20,734
Okay, listen.

288
00:14:20,735 --> 00:14:24,447
Have you ever heard of something
called "B.C.L. RED"?

289
00:14:27,117 --> 00:14:29,743
You mean a weapon
that can kill Homelander,

290
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:31,620
if Butcher can find it?

291
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:32,831
You know?

292
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,710
Who do you think sent them
down the rabbit hole?

293
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:40,004
It's why I'm training.

294
00:14:40,005 --> 00:14:44,383
Or haven't had a drink in
four awful, shit-eating months.

295
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:46,302
Maybe I can buy Butcher
a second or two

296
00:14:46,303 --> 00:14:47,636
to get a good shot.

297
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:50,890
At the very least,
I'll get a couple of licks in.

298
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,934
Okay.

299
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:56,687
Okay, okay.
So there's you and me.

300
00:14:56,688 --> 00:14:58,314
Maybe we can find some others.

301
00:14:58,315 --> 00:15:00,399
Right. Yeah.

302
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,318
I'm sure you
and Duluth's Most Mighty

303
00:15:02,319 --> 00:15:04,737
would really get the job done.

304
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:05,904
This is my problem.

305
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,282
I'm the one
who was with the asshole.

306
00:15:08,283 --> 00:15:10,284
Maeve...

307
00:15:10,285 --> 00:15:12,411
you cannot do this alone.

308
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:14,164
He'll kill you.

309
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,878
You really care
that little about yourself?

310
00:15:22,631 --> 00:15:24,341
I got it coming.

311
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:25,609
Good news.

312
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:28,153
Nina's had a word
with her Kremlin piss boys,

313
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:30,322
and she's located the lab.

314
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:32,449
- That's great. Where is it?
- Before she tells us that,

315
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:33,992
we just got to do
a little job for her.

316
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,244
Ain't nothing.

317
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:37,663
Just some local oligarch
who got in her bad books.

318
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:39,498
<i>Non.</i> I don't do this anymore.

319
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:40,874
Definitely not for Nina.

320
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:43,210
Well, that's a good job,
then, innit?

321

Homelander's gonna back him
over me?

483
00:24:09,824 --> 00:24:11,783
After everything that I've done
for that man.

484
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:14,161
I hit one little speed bump.

485
00:24:14,162 --> 00:24:16,371
Now...

486
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:18,958
I'm fucking garbage.

487
00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:27,967
What if...

488
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,762
we could do something
about it?

489
00:24:40,771 --> 00:24:42,440
What do you have in mind?

490
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:54,284
<i>Butcher, what the fuck</i>

491
00:24:54,285 --> 00:24:56,453
is wrong with you, man?

492
00:24:56,454 --> 00:24:58,205
I'm sure you're gonna tell me.

493
00:24:58,206 --> 00:24:59,831
That shit you pulled with Ryan

494
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:02,792
and now this coldhearted shit
you said to Kimiko?

495
00:25:02,793 --> 00:25:05,378
How could anybody be
such a complete asshole?

496
00:25:05,379 --> 00:25:07,631
- Practice.
- You knocked

497
00:25:07,632 --> 00:25:10,050
on my doorstep, motherfucker.

498
00:25:10,051 --> 00:25:13,303
And I respect
the chain of command, but this?

499
00:25:13,304 --> 00:25:16,265
I'm not gonna tolerate
your bullshit anymore, man.

500
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:20,268
Do you remember when we met?

501
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:22,354
Hard to forget.

502
00:25:22,355 --> 00:25:26,066
Me and the colonel,
we had our pick of officers.

503
00:25:26,067 --> 00:25:27,776
Some, uh...

504
00:25:27,777 --> 00:25:29,653
Some real haircuts.

505
00:25:29,654 --> 00:25:31,696
Do you ever wonder

506
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:35,784
why we picked some grunt Marine
stuck in the brig?

507
00:25:35,785 --> 00:25:37,369
Let's see.

508
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:40,288
I knocked out my racist C.O.
Sent him to the ICU

509
00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:42,123
with one punch,
so you knew I was strong.

510
00:25:42,124 --> 00:25:44,334
And you read my file,

511
00:25:44,335 --> 00:25:46,753
so you knew I hated Vought.

512
00:25:46,754 --> 00:25:48,255
Yeah, it weren't none of them.

513
00:25:48,256 --> 00:25:51,967
I mean, they didn't hurt,
mind, but no.

514
00:25:51,968 --> 00:25:53,510
We spoke to the blokes

515
00:25:53,511 --> 00:25:55,428
that you
went through basic with.

516
00:25:55,429 --> 00:25:59,015
And to the man, they said

517
00:25:59,016 --> 00:26:03,436
that you were the one
that held that platoon together.

518
00:26:03,437 --> 00:26:05,982
A natural-born leader.

519
00:26:11,946 --> 00:26:13,697
You never told me that.

520
00:26:13,698 --> 00:26:15,699
Mate,

521
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:19,703
I'm under no illusions
about who I am.

522
00:26:19,704 --> 00:26:22,163
And that's
why we brought you in.

523
00:26:22,164 --> 00:26:25,751
'Cause no matter how hard
I got to be...

524
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:30,381
you're here
to look after the Boys.

525
00:26:32,383 --> 00:26:34,384
Now,

526
00:26:34,385 --> 00:26:39,472
if I thought to do that,
I can't be a complete asshole,

527
00:26:39,473 --> 00:26:40,766
can I?

528
00:26:44,228 --> 00:26:46,564
Just mostly one.

529
00:27:06,542 --> 00:27:10,129

00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:19,615
Ladies...

543
00:28:20,825 --> 00:28:23,994
And now, for the most
delicious part.

544
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:29,125
These are contraband.

545
00:28:38,384 --> 00:28:40,635
Homelander's
"Star-spangled Banger."

546
00:28:40,636 --> 00:28:42,470
The Deep "Flounder Pounder."

547
00:28:42,471 --> 00:28:44,681
Black Noir's "Silent Screamer."

548
00:28:44,682 --> 00:28:46,391
Choose.

549
00:28:46,392 --> 00:28:48,393
Come.

550
00:28:48,394 --> 00:28:49,562
Come on.

551
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:58,654
Take off your dress.

552
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:12,334
On your hands and knees...

553
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:16,297
and your friend will

554
00:31:12,663 --> 00:31:15,248
- How do you feel?
- Like throwing up.

555
00:31:15,249 --> 00:31:18,669
Just remember, he deserves this.

556
00:31:20,254 --> 00:31:21,839
Good luck, sport.

557
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,220
<i>Good afternoon.
Thank you all for being here.</i>

558
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:31,055
<i>I'm Congresswoman
Victoria Neuman, the director of</i>

559
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:33,496
<i>- the Federal Bureau of Superhuman Affairs.</i>
- What's going on?

560
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:36,686
Oh, shit.
<i>- For the last year, the Bureau has been working</i>

561
00:31:36,687 --> 00:31:39,147
<i>- with Vought International under one guiding principle.</i>
- That.

562
00:31:39,148 --> 00:31:42,859
<i>The most powerful among us
are not above the law,</i>

563
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:46,071
<i>including the most powerful man
at the company.</i>

564
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:52,578
Homelander...

565
00:31:56,957 --> 00:31:59,751
has bravely come forward
as a whistleblower

566
00:31:59,752 --> 00:32:02,712
and provided evidence of crimes
committed within Vought

567
00:32:02,713 --> 00:32:04,506
by CEO Stan Edgar.

568
00:32:06,383 --> 00:32:07,717
And in the coming days,

569
00:32:07,718 --> 00:32:10,053
<i>the FBSA will be investigating</i>

570
00:32:10,054 --> 00:32:11,512
<i>charges of blackmail,</i>

571
00:32:11,513 --> 00:32:13,514
perjury
and obstruction of justice

572
00:32:13,515 --> 00:32:15,475
against Mr. Edgar.

573
00:32:15,476 --> 00:32:18,436
Vought International
must be held

574
00:32:18,437 --> 00:32:20,563
<i>to the highest ethical
and legal standards.</i>

575
00:32:20,564 --> 00:32:22,649
What did you do?
<i>- The people are entitled to the truth</i>

576
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:25,443
<i>- about their heroes...</i>
- Something I should've done a long time ago.

577
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:27,195
This is a superhero company.

578
00:32:27,196 --> 00:32:30,573
Always has been.
Belongs to us, not him.

579
00:32:30,574 --> 00:32:32,743
So I set things straight.

580
00:32:33,744 --> 00:32:35,162
That's all.

581
00:32:37,164 --> 00:32:39,332
Oh, and, uh,

582
00:32:39,333 --> 00:32:42,335
anyone who's been hiding
behind his little apron?

583
00:32:42,336 --> 00:32:44,087
That's over now, too.

584
00:32:44,088 --> 00:32:46,507
It's a new day, people.

585
00:32:48,926 --> 00:32:50,886
It's <i>The Dawn of The Seven.</i>

586
00:33:05,693 --> 00:33:07,151
Why?

587
00:33:07,152 --> 00:33:08,861
All these years,
you weren't protecting me.

588
00:33:08,862 --> 00:33:10,364
I was protecting you.

589
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:13,908
- I have to look out for Zoe.
- We need to go,

590
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:15,077
Mr. Edgar.

591
00:33:20,457 --> 00:33:22,291
So, from now on,
the talking points

592
00:33:22,292 --> 00:33:24,919
don't come from Suzanne.
They come from me.

593
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:28,339
I approve
every single word of copy.

594
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:29,590
Are we clear?

595
00:33:29,591 --> 00:33:31,801
- Crystal, ma'am.
- Jesus Christ.

596
00:33:31,802 --> 00:33:33,803
It's like this script
was written by a roomful

597
00:33:33,804 --> 00:33:35,096
of chapped-ass monkeys,
am I right?

598
00:33:35,097 --> 00:33:36,848
It's so bad.

599
00:33:36,849 --> 00:33:38,267
Um...

600
00:33:39,309 --> 00:33:41,353
I wrote it, ma'am.

601
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:45,356
I'm sorry.

602
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:48,193
Is your idiot brain
getting fucked by stupid?

603
00:33:49,653 --> 00:33:52,238
No, that's not rhetorical.

604
00:33:52,239 --> 00:33:54,032
Answer me.

605
00:33:57,494 --> 00:34:01,206
What if I said yes?

606
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:08,630
Then I would have to punish you.

607
00:34:10,257 --> 00:34:13,886
How would you punish me?

608
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:32,404
My idiot brain is getting fucked
by stupid, ma'am.

609
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,454
Well, how'd you get on?

610
00:34:45,626 --> 00:34:48,336
Oh, Nina's gonna love this.

611
00:34:48,337 --> 00:34:49,962
See? Told you.

612
00:34:49,963 --> 00:34:51,507
Easy-peasy.

613
00:35:13,278 --> 00:35:15,738
I can't do this.

614
00:35:15,739 --> 00:35:17,658
<i>Mon coeur?</i>

615
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:20,618
Those girls...

616
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:23,038
The girls who shot you?

617
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:29,711
They were just scared.

618
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:36,092
I know, I don't blame them.

619
00:35:36,093 --> 00:35:38,594
They were bought and sold

620
00:35:38,595 --> 00:35:40,430
same as me.

621
00:35:42,766 --> 00:35:43,975
Butcher

622
00:35:43,976 --> 00:35:45,602
sold me.

623
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:50,065
He doesn't treat
any of us as people.

624
00:35:54,361 --> 00:35:56,112
Butcher...

625
00:35:56,113 --> 00:35:57,864
Shining Light...

626
00:35:57,865 --> 00:36:00,199
Little Nina.

627
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:04,621
They are the same.

628
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:09,668
We only have each other.

629
00:36:10,294 --> 00:36:11,919
It's you

630
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:16,842
and me.

631
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:23,015
You're right.

632
00:36:24,641 --> 00:36:27,102
Maybe it's time we leave.

633
00:36:27,811 --> 00:36:29,896
- Really?
- Really.

634
00:36:29,897 --> 00:36:30,898
When?

635
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,649
Well, Butcher, he can, uh...

636
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:35,568
Well, he can lick my asshole.

637
00:36:35,569 --> 00:36:37,486
But Hughie

638
00:36:37,487 --> 00:36:39,405
and, uh, and M.M., they need us.

639
00:36:39,406 --> 00:36:41,408
So we do this job.

640
00:36:42,743 --> 00:36:45,954
And then
where do you want to go?

641
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:51,792
Marseilles.

642
00:36:51,793 --> 00:36:53,670
We go to Marseilles.

643
00:37:15,525 --> 00:37:16,735
Hey.

644
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:21,781
Heavy flow day?

645
00:37:21,782 --> 00:37:23,659
Kidding.

646
00:37:25,953 --> 00:37:27,328
Be honest.

647
00:37:27,329 --> 00:37:29,456
You thinking
of popping my melon?

648
00:37:31,124 --> 00:37:33,293
Who knows? Give it a whirl?

649
00:37:36,463 --> 00:37:38,547
Can we make this quick?

650
00:37:38,548 --> 00:37:40,466
It's been a long day.

651
00:37:40,467 --> 00:37:42,093
It has.

652
00:37:42,094 --> 00:37:45,638
It can't have been easy
shanking the old man like that.

653
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:49,600
But, if it's any consolation,

654
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:52,354
he was ready
to do exactly the same to you.

655
00:37:53,397 --> 00:37:55,231
What's this?

656
00:37:55,232 --> 00:37:57,149
Just a little oppo research

657
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:59,319
that I borrowed
from Edgar's office.

658
00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:03,948
How do you think I found out
you were one of us?

659
00:38:03,949 --> 00:38:07,743
This isn't his. This is someone else's.

660
00:38:07,744 --> 00:38:09,286
No.

661
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:10,706
It's his.

662
00:38:12,124 --> 00:38:13,750
You're not his daughter.

663
00:38:14,793 --> 00:38:16,585
You're his weapon.

664
00:38:16,586 --> 00:38:17,962
It's what they do.

665
00:38:17,963 --> 00:38:19,839
They all do it.

666
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,799
All of them.

667
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,176
Look, the point is,

668
00:38:24,177 --> 00:38:26,929
they have to do that to us.

669
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:30,057
They have to, because they know

670
00:38:30,058 --> 00:38:33,311
- deep down when they lie awake at night...
- Do you have it or not?

671
00:38:36,773 --> 00:38:38,483
As promised.

672
00:38:40,527 --> 00:38:43,947
Original recipe.
All 11 herbs and spices.

673
00:38:55,208 --> 00:38:56,376
Vicky.

674
00:38:58,128 --> 00:39:00,714
I'm glad you chose
your own kind.

675
00:39:03,717 --> 00:39:05,302
That was smart.

676
00:39:49,346 --> 00:39:51,181
Butcher, can I, uh...

677
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:54,059
What are you doing?

678
00:39:56,478 --> 00:39:58,312
Contingency.

679
00:39:58,313 --> 00:40:01,858
In case things go
ass over tit at the lab.

680
00:40:08,615 --> 00:40:10,283
I want to try some.

681
00:40:12,327 --> 00:40:14,120
Don't be daft.

682
00:40:14,121 --> 00:40:15,704
This shit is poison, Hughie.

683
00:40:15,705 --> 00:40:17,498
A lad like you
don't want no part of it.

684
00:40:17,499 --> 00:40:19,959
What, you mean like a loser?

685
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,544
A fuckup?

686
00:40:21,545 --> 00:40:25,214
Sooner or later,
Homelander will find Ryan.

687
00:40:25,215 --> 00:40:27,800
Okay?
It's just a matter of time.

688
00:40:27,801 --> 00:40:29,844
I have to do this, all right?

689
00:40:29,845 --> 00:40:31,345
You don't.

690
00:40:31,346 --> 00:40:33,055
Annie's in just as much danger.

691
00:40:33,056 --> 00:40:35,975
Homelander almost lasered me
in half in front of her,

692
00:40:35,976 --> 00:40:38,185
and it was like...
it was like I was back

693
00:40:38,186 --> 00:40:40,980
with every bully that
I ever had, just taking it.

694
00:40:40,981 --> 00:40:43,567
And then
she had to save me again.

695
00:40:46,987 --> 00:40:49,488
Butcher, please. Please.

696
00:40:49,489 --> 00:40:51,323
Please.

697
00:40:51,324 --> 00:40:55,912
Because right now, I am so angry
that I can't even breathe.

698
00:40:58,331 --> 00:41:00,917
Oh, Hughie.

699
00:41:03,128 --> 00:41:05,880
It's shittier.

700
00:41:05,881 --> 00:41:08,465
It's not power.

701
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:10,217
It's punishment.

702
00:41:10,218 --> 00:41:13,096
You don't deserve none of it.

703
00:41:15,432 --> 00:41:17,267
What, and you do?

704
00:41:24,691 --> 00:41:26,568
Get ready to go.

705
00:41:32,115 --> 00:41:35,242
You do have a hell of a view
from up here.

706
00:41:35,243 --> 00:41:36,661
I'll give you that.

707
00:41:38,121 --> 00:41:40,123
You should see it from space.

708
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:45,336
Unbelievable. Eighty over 60.

709
00:41:45,337 --> 00:41:47,129
Your entire life is imploding,

710
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:50,717
and it's as if you're reading
fucking John Grisham.

711
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:58,182
I heard about your, uh,

712
00:41:58,183 --> 00:42:00,893
temporary leave of absence,
by the way.

713
00:42:00,894 --> 00:42:02,728
Those things
do have a nasty habit

714
00:42:02,729 --> 00:42:04,856
of becoming permanent,
though, don't they?

715
00:42:11,613 --> 00:42:14,156
- Don't blame Vicky. You...
- I don't.

716
00:42:14,157 --> 00:42:15,950
If there's one thing
I taught her,

717
00:42:15,951 --> 00:42:18,370
it was to play all sides.

718
00:42:20,372 --> 00:42:23,499
She's more like me
than I ever imagined.

719
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:26,210
But I am curious.

720
00:42:26,211 --> 00:42:27,461
What did you give her?

721
00:42:27,462 --> 00:42:29,129
A little respect, Stan.

722
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:31,340
Something
you should've given me.

723
00:42:31,341 --> 00:42:34,385
What good would that do?

724
00:42:34,386 --> 00:42:36,512
Where would it even go

725
00:42:36,513 --> 00:42:39,390
but to the bottomless,
gaping pit of insecurity

726
00:42:39,391 --> 00:42:41,476
you call a soul?

727
00:42:44,396 --> 00:42:46,772
Oh, God.
You want to know something?

728
00:42:46,773 --> 00:42:49,858
I used to be intimidated by you.

729
00:42:49,859 --> 00:42:51,151
I did.

730
00:42:51,152 --> 00:42:53,779
And now I look at you,
I-I'm just...

731
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:56,991
I-I have no idea why. Truly.

732
00:42:56,992 --> 00:43:00,244
Y-You're not even pathetic.

733
00:43:00,245 --> 00:43:03,664
You're-you're just... nothing.

734
00:43:03,665 --> 00:43:05,582
Then why are you still here,

735
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:08,586
looking for my approval
like I'm your daddy?

736
00:43:09,629 --> 00:43:13,090
And even if I were, what would
there be to approve of?

737
00:43:13,091 --> 00:43:14,842
The company is yours.

738
00:43:14,843 --> 00:43:17,261
No one left to stand up to you.

739
00:43:17,262 --> 00:43:22,599
But I think you'll come
to sorely regret that.

740
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,060
And why is that?

741
00:43:25,061 --> 00:43:29,440
Because there's no one left
to cover for you, either.

742
00:43:29,441 --> 00:43:31,442
Eventually, probably soon,

743
00:43:31,443 --> 00:43:33,736
the world will recognize you

744
00:43:33,737 --> 00:43:37,323
for the pitiful disappointment
you are.

745
00:43:37,324 --> 00:43:40,242
You are not worthy
of my respect.

746
00:43:40,243 --> 00:43:41,994
You are not a god.

747
00:43:41,995 --> 00:43:45,832
You are simply bad product.

748
00:43:58,345 --> 00:44:00,137
I'm scared.

749
00:44:00,138 --> 00:44:01,389
I know.

750
00:44:04,225 --> 00:44:07,895
You know, when I was little,
they did the same thing to me.

751
00:44:07,896 --> 00:44:09,898
And I'm all right.

752
00:44:13,985 --> 00:44:15,861
We have to, okay?

753
00:44:15,862 --> 00:44:17,738
'Cause you know what?
It's gonna make you

754
00:44:17,739 --> 00:44:21,116
so strong and safe.

755
00:44:21,117 --> 00:44:22,785
Forever.

756
00:44:22,786 --> 00:44:25,329
- Okay?
- Okay.

757
00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:27,832
Okay, turn around.
On your belly.

758
00:44:52,107 --> 00:44:53,525
Just a pinch.

759
00:45:03,868 --> 00:45:06,370
Okay. Okay. Come here,
come here, come here.

760
00:45:06,371 --> 00:45:07,956
It's okay. Shh.

761
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:11,959
It's okay. It's okay. Shh.

762
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:14,838
Shh, shh. It's okay.

763
00:45:18,425 --> 00:45:20,593
- Ow!
- It's gonna be okay.

764
00:45:21,636 --> 00:45:23,512
Shh, shh. It's okay.

765
00:45:23,513 --> 00:45:26,683
I've got you. I've got you. Shh.

766
00:45:32,564 --> 00:45:34,857
That chick Nina
didn't do us no favors.

767
00:45:34,858 --> 00:45:37,234
That ain't a lab.
It's a military compound.

768
00:45:37,235 --> 00:45:39,194
Russian military compound.

769
00:45:39,195 --> 00:45:42,031
Be like storming a Baja Fresh.

770
00:45:45,076 --> 00:45:46,326
Baja Fresh ain't shooting us

771
00:45:46,327 --> 00:45:49,080
with AK-47s on full auto, motherfucker.

772
00:46:15,356 --> 00:46:16,941
<i>Red Dawn,</i> motherfucker.

773
00:46:30,955 --> 00:46:32,790
<i>Rocky IV,</i> motherfucker.

774
00:46:33,875 --> 00:46:35,542
Come on.

775
00:46:35,543 --> 00:46:37,002
We ain't got much time.

776
00:46:37,003 --> 00:46:38,754
Any idea what this Supe gun is

777
00:46:38,755 --> 00:46:42,008
- supposed to look like?
- Ain't the joy in the discovery, eh?

778
00:46:57,315 --> 00:46:58,900
What is it?

779
00:47:14,457 --> 00:47:16,333
Hey, there's something here.

780
00:47:16,334 --> 00:47:17,960
Look.

781
00:47:17,961 --> 00:47:20,380
Look, look. Oh.

782
00:47:23,341 --> 00:47:24,925
Hey.

783
00:47:24,926 --> 00:47:26,385
What does it say?

784
00:47:26,386 --> 00:47:28,720
Says his name is Jamie.

785
00:47:28,721 --> 00:47:30,639
Jamie.

786
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:31,766
Hi.

787
00:47:32,767 --> 00:47:34,393
- Are you okay, Jamie?
- No, no, no, don't fuck with it.

788
00:47:34,394 --> 00:47:35,895
Just leave him alone.

789
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:39,648
Aw. Jamie.

790
00:47:39,649 --> 00:47:43,236
Who's a handsome,
petite, little gerbil?

791
00:47:45,113 --> 00:47:46,531
It's a hamster.

792
00:47:47,907 --> 00:47:50,367
My daughter went through three of them.

793
00:47:50,368 --> 00:47:52,202
Oh, shit.

794
00:47:52,203 --> 00:47:53,621
Motherfucking V'd-up hamster.

795
00:47:55,331 --> 00:47:57,291
I told you

796
00:47:57,292 --> 00:47:58,875
not to fuck with him.
Goddamn it.

797
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:00,044
Look lively!

798
00:48:43,338 --> 00:48:44,839
<i>Merci, Jamie.</i>

799
00:48:48,426 --> 00:48:49,594
I'm out!

800
00:49:09,739 --> 00:49:10,907
Oi!

801
00:49:12,784 --> 00:49:14,285
Evening, cunts.

802
00:49:44,148 --> 00:49:45,858
M.M.!

803
00:49:49,028 --> 00:49:51,113
Oh! Oh!

804
00:49:51,114 --> 00:49:53,115
Oh, shit. I'm sorry.

805
00:49:53,116 --> 00:49:54,449
I'm sorry.

806
00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:57,412
Uh...

807
00:50:16,889 --> 00:50:18,766
Your dick's out.

808
00:50:22,061 --> 00:50:23,479
Uh...

809
00:50:32,196 --> 00:50:34,406
- Butcher?
- All right, all right, look, hang about.

810
00:50:34,407 --> 00:50:36,616
You and Hughie
both took Compound V?

811
00:50:36,617 --> 00:50:38,493
What are you two,
fucking Supes now?

812
00:50:38,494 --> 00:50:40,496
Temporary V.

813
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:47,502
{\an8}Oh, she say, "Why do you do this
to yourself on purpose?"

814
00:50:47,503 --> 00:50:49,421
Only lasts 24 hours, all right?

815
00:50:49,422 --> 00:50:51,089
Break glass in case
of emergencies, you know,

816
00:50:51,090 --> 00:50:53,300
- like this one.
- And you give this to-to Hughie?

817
00:50:53,301 --> 00:50:55,469
I didn't give it to him. The
thieving git must have broken

818
00:50:55,470 --> 00:50:56,929
into the case and nicked it.

819
00:50:58,097 --> 00:50:59,306
- Uh...
- Let's just find this thing

820
00:50:59,307 --> 00:51:01,641
and get the fuck
out of here, all right?

821
00:51:01,642 --> 00:51:04,312
You're better than this, kid.

822
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:09,149
Butcher, I'm... Look...

823
00:51:09,150 --> 00:51:12,320
I'm s... I'm sorry, okay?
It's just, I...

824
00:52:20,555 --> 00:52:22,348
Soldier Boy.

825
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:08,895
Ah... It's okay.

826
00:53:37,423 --> 00:53:39,133
Kimiko.

827
00:53:41,719 --> 00:53:43,094
It's okay. Huh?

828
00:53:43,095 --> 00:53:44,305
It's okay.

829
00:53:46,057 --> 00:53:48,391
She's not healing.

830
00:53:48,392 --> 00:53:49,810
Why she's not healing?

831
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:52,688
Kimiko. Why does she not heal?

832
00:53:55,149 --> 00:53:56,943
Kimiko. She's not healing!

833
00:53:59,612 --> 00:54:02,072
Gauze.
Frenchie, fresh gauze.

834
00:54:02,073 --> 00:54:03,531
- Oh, no, no, no...
- Give me some fresh gauze. Open your eyes.

835
00:54:03,532 --> 00:54:05,075
Open your eyes.
Hold her head up, Frenchie.

836
00:54:05,076 --> 00:54:06,534
- <i>Mon coeur.</i>
- Open your eyes, Kimiko.

837
00:54:06,535 --> 00:54:08,703
- Hey.
- Open your eyes. Open your eyes.

838
00:54:08,704 --> 00:54:10,705
- <i>Mon coeur.</i>
- Kimiko, there you go.

839
00:54:10,706 --> 00:54:12,040
Look at Frenchie.

840
00:54:12,041 --> 00:54:14,584
- <i>Mon coeur? Mon coeur?</i>
- Open your eyes, Kimiko,

841
00:54:14,585 --> 00:54:17,170
- open your eyes.
- Soldier Boy was always an hard bastard,

842
00:54:17,171 --> 00:54:18,964
- but not like that.
- <i>Mon coeur.</i>

843
00:54:18,965 --> 00:54:21,174
They must have done
something to him.

844
00:54:21,175 --> 00:54:22,718
What you think?

845
00:54:24,637 --> 00:54:26,554
<i>Mon coeur. Mon coeur.</i>

846
00:54:26,555 --> 00:54:29,392
- Kimiko...
- It's over, Butcher.

847
00:54:30,893 --> 00:54:33,019
There ain't no team for me
to hold together no more.

848
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:34,187
<i>Mon coeur?</i>

849
00:54:34,188 --> 00:54:35,855
No, please, please,
no, no, no, no, no.

850
00:54:35,856 --> 00:54:37,732
You made sure of that.

851
00:54:37,733 --> 00:54:39,734
Come on.
Come on. Kimiko!

852
00:54:39,735 --> 00:54:41,236
Hold her head up, Frenchie.

853
00:54:41,237 --> 00:54:43,071
- She's... No.
- Kimiko, open your eyes.

854
00:54:43,072 --> 00:54:44,865
- <i>Mon coeur!</i>
- Open your eyes.

855
00:54:51,998 --> 00:54:54,833
Hey, you know what?
I think I want to fly home.

856
00:54:54,834 --> 00:54:56,168
You want to fly?

857
00:54:57,211 --> 00:54:58,461
Uh, the car's right here.

858
00:54:58,462 --> 00:55:00,130
Um, next time?

859
00:55:00,131 --> 00:55:02,257
No, no, no, no.
Come on, I'll-I'll carry you.

860
00:55:02,258 --> 00:55:04,175
Who wants to see
Starlight and me fly?

861
00:55:04,176 --> 00:55:05,969
Huh?

862
00:55:05,970 --> 00:55:07,804
What, are you gonna
disappoint them?

863
00:55:07,805 --> 00:55:10,432
- Okay.
- Come on, up you go.

864
00:55:10,433 --> 00:55:13,351
There you go.

865
00:55:13,352 --> 00:55:16,771
I, uh, I have a view
I really want to show you.

866
00:55:16,772 --> 00:55:18,982
It's gonna blow your mind.

867
00:55:18,983 --> 00:55:21,152
Hold on tight.

868
00:55:28,409 --> 00:55:30,285
This really is a beautiful city.

869
00:55:30,286 --> 00:55:32,245
You know,
you don't need to do this.

870
00:55:32,246 --> 00:55:33,706
The cameras are gone.

871
00:55:35,207 --> 00:55:37,375
Yeah.

872
00:55:37,376 --> 00:55:40,211
But, see, that's the thing
about me, Starlight.

873
00:55:40,212 --> 00:55:42,213
If I promise something,
I deliver.

874
00:55:42,214 --> 00:55:46,510
Now, that is the view
of a lifetime.

875
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:50,723
Alex?

876
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:56,061
Alex!

877
00:55:56,062 --> 00:55:57,353
Oh, my God.

878
00:55:57,354 --> 00:55:59,190
You fucking psycho!

879
00:56:00,441 --> 00:56:02,358
Stop it. You know how that ends.

880
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:04,110
You know, besides,

881
00:56:04,111 --> 00:56:06,488
this is your fault
as much as it is mine.

882
00:56:06,489 --> 00:56:09,699
- What?
- A-Train told me about you two mutineers

883
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:11,367
and your little plot.

884
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:14,245
You just don't get it, do you?

885
00:56:14,246 --> 00:56:15,413
I mean, you have
no fucking grasp

886
00:56:15,414 --> 00:56:18,541
of the situation you're in
at all, right?

887
00:56:18,542 --> 00:56:20,710
I'm gonna break it down
one more time,

888
00:56:20,711 --> 00:56:22,170
and I'm gonna make it
crystal clear

889
00:56:22,171 --> 00:56:25,048
so that even you
can understand it, okay?

890
00:56:25,049 --> 00:56:28,843
There will be no more plotting,
planning, playing around.

891
00:56:28,844 --> 00:56:31,679
That is over, okay?

892
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:36,184
From here on out,
there is only my dutiful, loving

893
00:56:36,185 --> 00:56:40,855
main squeeze Starlight,
worshiping me and me alone.

894
00:56:40,856 --> 00:56:42,857
Because if you step one inch
out of line,

895
00:56:42,858 --> 00:56:45,693
I mean, i-if you so much
as fucking blink the wrong way,

896
00:56:45,694 --> 00:56:50,032
then that, my love,
will be Hughie.

897
00:56:53,994 --> 00:56:56,497
Do you understand this time?

898
00:57:00,167 --> 00:57:01,544
Good.

899
00:57:02,878 --> 00:57:07,006
Then say it, so I know.

900
00:57:07,007 --> 00:57:09,009
"That'll be Hughie."

901
00:57:12,847 --> 00:57:14,472
That'll be Hughie.

902
00:57:14,473 --> 00:57:15,975
There it is.

903
00:57:19,395 --> 00:57:21,397
Find your own way home.
