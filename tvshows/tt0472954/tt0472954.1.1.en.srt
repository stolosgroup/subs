1
00:00:02,252 --> 00:00:06,211
<i>Another big night, fellas... $ 164.87.</i>

2
00:00:06,289 --> 00:00:08,189
<i>- That's not a lot of money.
- No, it isn't.</i>

3
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:11,455
- And our mortgage is due in two weeks.
- We paid that a week ago.

4
00:00:11,528 --> 00:00:14,258
A week ago was
three weeks late, Mac.

5
00:00:14,331 --> 00:00:16,322
Hey, guys.

6
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:20,165
I met this guy in acting class. He's really
cool, and he wants to see where I work.

7
00:00:20,237 --> 00:00:22,933
So could you guys
try to not be weird?

8
00:00:23,006 --> 00:00:27,375
- What is that supposed to mean?
- I love you guys, but sometimes you're not that cool.

9
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:29,469
- We're cool!
- Not cool?

10
00:00:29,546 --> 00:00:32,014
<i>- Try to be cool.
- Sometimes you're not too cool.</i>

11
00:00:32,082 --> 00:00:34,277
<i>- Charlie...
- Always cool, man.</i>

12
00:00:34,351 --> 00:00:37,047
- Oh, hey, man, we're closed.
- Yeah, I know.

13
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,180
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! We don't want any trouble.
- What?

14
00:00:40,257 --> 00:00:42,987
Guys, this is Terrell...

15
00:00:43,059 --> 00:00:44,993
from my acting class.

16
00:00:47,998 --> 00:00:50,865
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Hey, man. How's it goin'?

17
00:00:50,934 --> 00:00:54,062
<i>- It's going good. How you doin'?
- Good, man.</i>

18
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:56,162
- We're just chillin', dude.
- Great.

19
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:58,070
- Just closing up shop.
- Yeah.

20
00:00:58,141 --> 00:00:59,836
Whoa.

21
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:03,539
Guess you guys don't have too many brothers
walking through here.

22
00:01:03,613 --> 00:01:05,547
- Oh, no, no.
- We got plenty of brothers.

23
00:01:05,615 --> 00:01:07,412
Yeah...
A-African-Americans.

24
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:09,645
Okay. Yeah, we get it.

25
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:12,187
You might know some of them.

26
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:16,250
Yeah.
We're probably related.

27
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:18,351
No.

28
00:01:18,428 --> 00:01:21,761
I don't think he was implying that you guys
are all related. That's ridiculous.

29
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:26,234
<i>Sweet Dee came in here a second ago
and started talking about acting class.</i>

30
00:01:26,303 --> 00:01:30,637
- We weren't expecting you...
- We weren't expecting you to be black, that's all.

31
00:01:33,543 --> 00:01:35,443
Right.

32
00:01:40,617 --> 00:01:42,414
Thanks, guys.

<i>When I'm promotin', everybody
and their mama gonna be there.</i>

35
00:02:17,087 --> 00:02:19,555
There's gonna be brothers,
white boys, Latinos, whatever.

36
00:02:19,622 --> 00:02:22,147
You got niggas
hanging from the rafters.

37
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:25,160
<i>So we got 400-plus packed
into this tiny little place...</i>

38
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:28,095
Whoa. You had 400 people
packed into a place?

39
00:02:28,164 --> 00:02:30,132
You damn right.
That's my job, man.

40
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,168
And it's mostly college kids.

41
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:34,635
My sister goes to Temple,
so I got the hookup over there.

42
00:02:34,704 --> 00:02:36,569
And hookups are good.

43
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:40,700
But, just to be clear, when you say your sister,
do you mean your sister or your friend...

44
00:02:40,777 --> 00:02:42,574
- Dude.
- Oh, Jesus.

45
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,915
<i>- I mean my sister.
- Oh. Okay. Cool.</i>

46
00:02:46,983 --> 00:02:50,077
I was just... Because
he could mean his friend or his...

47
00:02:50,153 --> 00:02:52,018
Stop talking.

48
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:54,522
So we're packed into
this little place on Walnut.

49
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:57,685
We're halfway through the night,
everything's goin' all right.

50
00:02:57,761 --> 00:03:01,629
All of a sudden, I notice this dude
eyeballin' me from across the bar.

51
00:03:01,698 --> 00:03:05,828
- Shit.
- I don't know if this dude wants to freak me or fight me.

52
00:03:05,902 --> 00:03:08,632
<i>- He's giving you crazy eyes.
- The insane, crazy eyes.</i>

53
00:03:08,705 --> 00:03:10,570
- Right?
- I know that.

54
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,006
So I walk over...
He's this big, cut Mexican dude...

55
00:03:13,076 --> 00:03:16,739
<i>and I look at him and say,
"Yo, ese...</i>

56
00:03:16,813 --> 00:03:20,305
unless you want
to get yo' ass torn apart...

57
00:03:20,383 --> 00:03:22,908
you'd better get
that look off your face."

58
00:03:22,986 --> 00:03:26,046
- No!
- You just walked right up to him and said that?

59
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:28,522
I had to, man.
You gotta make the first move.

60
00:03:28,591 --> 00:03:31,526
- Always make the first move. You know what I'm sayin'?
- I-I know.

61
00:03:31,594 --> 00:03:34,529
- So what happened?
- Well, hey, he won't stop starin' me down.

62
00:03:34,597 --> 00:03:38,693
We're, like, eyeball to eyeball. His grill is
right up in mine. It feels like an eternity.

63
00:03:38,768 --> 00:03:41,066
<i>Finally...</i>

64
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:44,504
he just opens up his mouth
and says...

65
00:03:44,574 --> 00:03:48,806
"I guess you gon' have to
tear my ass apart, homes."

66
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:52,143
Oh, man. So what'd you do?

67
00:03:52,215 --> 00:03:54,240
Took him to the back alley...

68
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:56,945
and I tore his ass apart!

69
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,817
Oh, my God!

70
00:03:58,888 --> 00:04:00,583
That's insane!

71
00:04:03,726 --> 00:04:07,025
Okay, I would like to do
things like that.

72
00:04:07,097 --> 00:04:10,032
<i>I love that guy.
"I took him to the back alley"?</i>

73
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:13,592
- Who does shit like that? It's like a movie.
- There's something off about him.

74
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:17,538
- Oh, bro, that's racist.
- No, asshole, that's not what I meant.

75
00:04:17,607 --> 00:04:20,474
- I'll go get the coffee. What do you guys want?
- Dude, sit down. Okay?

76
00:04:20,543 --> 00:04:23,478
Wait till the waitress comes out here,
and then you can stare at her.

77
00:04:23,546 --> 00:04:26,692
- I wasn't gonna stare at her. I was just gonna...
- He wasn't gonna stare at her.

78
00:04:26,716 --> 00:04:29,776
- You're totally obsessed with that chick.
- No, I'm not. I like her.

79
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:34,290
I have a little bit of a crush, yes.
But obsessed? That's a bit of a harsh word.

80
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:38,851
- It's never gonna happen.
- Honestly, I think we should think about hiring Terrell.

81
00:04:38,928 --> 00:04:40,793
- Why? For what?
- You heard him.

82
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:43,142
When he's promotin',
everybody named Mama's looking to get in.

83
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:46,033
That's true. They do have
"niggers hanging from rafters."

84
00:04:46,102 --> 00:04:49,037
- Wow. Nice.
- No, that's not what I was saying.

85
00:04:49,105 --> 00:04:50,504
- Coffee?
- Yeah.

86
00:04:50,573 --> 00:04:53,474
- Hitler?
- No, I'm not... I'm not Adolf Hitler.

87
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:56,522
- I'll make sure to put lots of cream in yours.
- I was quoting a black friend.

88
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:58,480
Okay.

89
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:00,482
Well, that's just great.

90
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:03,519
- Now she thinks I'm racist.
- Dude, will you just drop it?

91
00:05:03,586 --> 00:05:06,987
Listen, if Terrell delivers half of what
he promises, we're looking at 200 people.

92
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:11,618
- Yeah, that's true.
- It'd be nice to get some chicks in the bar.

93
00:05:11,694 --> 00:05:13,821
All right, let's do it.

94
00:05:18,134 --> 00:05:19,999
- Sure about this?
- It's 2005, Charlie.

95
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:23,505
Don't you think it's ridiculous that you
have no friends outside of your own race?

96
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:26,508
- No, what is ridiculous is this stupid plan.
- It's not stupid!

97
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:29,170
- It's a stupid plan.
- It's not... This is a college campus.

98
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:32,681
This is a great place to meet people
of different cultures, diversify...

99
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:35,616
You're just trying to make black...
Mm-hmm.

100
00:05:36,719 --> 00:05:38,653
You're trying to make
black friends.

101
00:05:38,721 --> 00:05:42,201
- You're not making it easy.
- You're trying to impress Terrell with a couple of black friends.

102
00:05:42,225 --> 00:05:44,318
Don't do this right now.

103
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:50,721
Okay. See? This is exactly
what I'm talking about.

104
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,734
- This is perfect.
- Huh. Yeah.

105
00:05:52,802 --> 00:05:55,293
- I'm gonna break the ice.
- Go for it.

106
00:05:55,371 --> 00:05:57,236
'Bout to bust that shit up, Reese.

107
00:05:57,307 --> 00:05:59,571
'Bout to bust that shit up, boy!

108
00:05:59,642 --> 00:06:01,576
Absolutely.

109
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:11,352
- Okay, that didn't go exactly the way...
- No.

110
00:06:11,421 --> 00:06:13,616
<i>- No. It was really awkward.
- Really awkward.</i>

111
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:15,681
- Maybe we should go.
- Yeah!

112
00:06:15,758 --> 00:06:18,852
- Hey, what's your name?
- Oh. It's, uh, Charlie.

113
00:06:18,928 --> 00:06:20,896
Do you play bones, Charlie?

114
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:22,864
I dabble.

115
00:06:22,932 --> 00:06:25,867
Do you want to play?
I could get you a game.

116
00:06:25,935 --> 00:06:28,870
Uh, no, I shouldn't.
I'm not very good, so...

117
00:06:28,938 --> 00:06:32,897
- I bet you're really good.
- Well, it's been a long time, you know.

118
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:34,967
- Oh, come on.
- All right. One game.

119
00:06:35,044 --> 00:06:38,070
Domino, bitch!

120
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,719
This is bullshit.
Absolute bullshit.

121
00:06:44,787 --> 00:06:48,245
- Why do these people like you more than they like me?
- Maybe it's comments like that.

122
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:52,124
I meant those people in there, not all
black people. What am I supposed to say?

123
00:06:52,195 --> 00:06:55,096
You should say something different.
Figure something else out.

124
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:57,098
- Hey.
- Hey.

125
00:06:57,166 --> 00:07:00,192
- Um, I'm Janell.
- Oh, hi.

126
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:03,637
- Uh, you got some moves out there, Charlie.
- Thanks.

127
00:07:03,706 --> 00:07:05,640
You know.

128
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:08,233
I wanted to give you this.

129
00:07:08,311 --> 00:07:10,245
- Oh. Okay.
- You know?

130
00:07:10,313 --> 00:07:13,976
- Give me a call sometime. All right?
- Yeah. Sure.

131
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:16,041
Well, you...

132
00:07:16,119 --> 00:07:18,986
<i>- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! What are you doing, dude?
- What?</i>

133
00:07:19,055 --> 00:07:20,989
That girl's gorgeous.

134
00:07:21,057 --> 00:07:24,236
She's the perfect opportunity to prove we're
not racist. She probably has friends for me.

135
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:27,718
Well, if anything, I think we should be
focused on black men, first of all.

136
00:07:27,797 --> 00:07:29,856
What?

137
00:07:29,932 --> 00:07:32,799
We don't really need...
We need black guys, so...

138
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:35,337
- Black guys? What are you talking about?
- You know.

139
00:07:35,405 --> 00:07:38,738
Is this about that waitress
at the coffee shop, dude?

140
00:07:38,808 --> 00:07:40,673
- Oh, my God!
- What?

141
00:07:40,743 --> 00:07:43,234
- Dude, you are obsessed with this chick.
- No, I'm not.

142
00:07:43,313 --> 00:07:45,178
- Let me see your wallet.
- Why?

143
00:07:45,248 --> 00:07:48,945
- Are you still carrying a picture of her in your wallet?
- No.

144
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:56,991
Give it to me.
Give it...

145
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,688
Oh, my God!
Stop making a scene!

146
00:07:59,762 --> 00:08:02,162
<i>Just give me the wallet!
Give me the wallet!</i>

147
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:04,222
I can't get the goddamn...

148
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,427
<i>It's okay! It's okay, everybody!</i>

149
00:08:06,502 --> 00:08:08,868
<i>- You're making a scene.
- You're making a scene!</i>

150
00:08:08,938 --> 00:08:10,735
I got it.

151
00:08:10,807 --> 00:08:13,640
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Hold on a second.

152
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:16,941
- Ha! Ha-ha! Ha!
- Give it to me!

153
00:08:17,013 --> 00:08:18,776
He had it!

154
00:08:18,848 --> 00:08:20,611
Okay! You found it!

155
00:08:20,683 --> 00:08:22,776
- I'm gonna tear it up!
- No, don't!

156
00:08:24,153 --> 00:08:27,179
Just give me it.
I'll call the black girl. Okay?

157
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:29,224
Okay, buddy.

158
00:08:29,292 --> 00:08:31,886
We're cool. We're cool.

159
00:08:31,961 --> 00:08:35,021
We're good.
Thanks, guys. See ya.

160
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:43,337
I had the craziest dream last night
that I was in Cleveland, Ohio...

161
00:08:43,406 --> 00:08:46,341
which is really weird,
because I've never even been to Ohio.

162
00:08:46,409 --> 00:08:49,344
This guy was wearing a bunny suit,
and he was coming out...

163
00:08:49,412 --> 00:08:52,347
You know what, Dee?
I don't wanna hear about your dreams. Okay?

164
00:08:52,415 --> 00:08:56,351
I hate listening to people's dreams. It's
like flipping through a stack of photographs.

165
00:08:56,419 --> 00:08:59,855
If I'm not in any of'em and nobody's
having sex, I just... I don't care.

166
00:08:59,922 --> 00:09:02,789
Oh. I'm sorry.
I would listen to your dreams.

167
00:09:02,859 --> 00:09:05,828
- 'Cause your my brother and I love you.
- I'm sorry. I am.

168
00:09:05,895 --> 00:09:08,625
<i>- Hey! What's goin' on, guys?
- Terrell.</i>

169
00:09:08,698 --> 00:09:11,565
- How are you?
- Hey! What's up? What's up?

170
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:15,297
How you doin'?
Dennis! What's goin' on?

171
00:09:15,371 --> 00:09:17,362
- All right, man.
- How's it goin', man?

172
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,305
Good, man.

173
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:23,004
Listen, um, you mind stepping outside
with me for a second, man?

174
00:09:23,079 --> 00:09:24,944
- Yeah, I'll come outside.
- Yeah?

175
00:09:25,014 --> 00:09:27,209
- Yeah.
- All right. Well, come on.

176
00:09:28,751 --> 00:09:32,517
I'm gonna put these out
on the tables.

177
00:09:33,523 --> 00:09:36,890
Rule number one:
Always keep a line.

178
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,359
Oh, my God!
That is a lot of people!

179
00:09:39,429 --> 00:09:41,363
Wow!

180
00:09:47,303 --> 00:09:51,603
- This is crazy!
- I know! I told you! Terrell's the best!

181
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:54,234
I'm gonna have to start
bartending full-time.

182
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:56,244
L-Look at this!

183
00:09:57,547 --> 00:10:00,380
- Why are you making more money than me?
- I don't know!

184
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:04,477
- Hey, this is crazy!
- I know. Terrell packed 'em in. Look at this.

185
00:10:04,554 --> 00:10:07,955
- This is crazy!
- Yeah, dude, we were just saying that.

186
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:09,924
- Lot of dudes.
- Yeah, there's a lot of dudes.

187
00:10:09,992 --> 00:10:11,721
Lot of dudes.

188
00:10:11,794 --> 00:10:13,694
What can I get you boys?

189
00:10:13,763 --> 00:10:17,324
- Oh, uh, we wanted to wait for the cute one.
- What cute one?

190
00:10:21,237 --> 00:10:23,364
Mac, isn't that your cousin Brett
by the jukebox?

191
00:10:25,274 --> 00:10:27,105
- Oh, yeah!
- Let's go say hey.

192
00:10:27,176 --> 00:10:30,111
- Yo, Brettie boy!
- Hey, cuz!

193
00:10:30,179 --> 00:10:34,377
- Hey! How you doin'?
- What's up, Brett? Can you believe this crowd?

194
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:37,248
- Oh, it's something else!
- Yeah!

195
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,948
Gentlemen, I understand
my services have been requested.

196
00:10:40,022 --> 00:10:42,388
I actually got a couple of services
I'd like to request.

197
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:44,949
Whoa! Uh, what are you doin, man?
I'm not...

198
00:10:45,027 --> 00:10:49,123
- You have the most beautiful eyes.
- Okay, man, but I'm... Really?

199
00:10:49,198 --> 00:10:51,029
<i>So blue.</i>

200
00:10:52,101 --> 00:10:55,036
Really more of
a blue-green, actually, but...

201
00:10:55,104 --> 00:10:57,834
- I'm really proud of you, man.
- Yeah, thanks.

202
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:00,637
- You've come a long way.
- What do you mean?

203
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:04,737
You guys are running
the hottest gay bar in Philadelphia.

204
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:23,960
No! What in the hell
is your problem?

205
00:11:24,033 --> 00:11:26,695
How could you not tell me
you were gay?

206
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:30,671
I'm a musical theater actor living in Philadelphia.
I didn't think it was that big a secret.

207
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,935
I've been coming on to you
for weeks now.

208
00:11:33,009 --> 00:11:35,637
- Just thought you were into gay dudes.
- I am not into gay dudes!

209
00:11:35,711 --> 00:11:38,043
- Apparently you are.
- Okay, well, you know what?

210
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:40,993
The guys hired you to promote their bar,
and you turned it into a gay bar.

211
00:11:41,017 --> 00:11:42,951
They are not happy.

212
00:11:47,023 --> 00:11:48,957
- So much money!
- Whoo!

213
00:11:49,025 --> 00:11:52,586
Oh! So much money!
We made more money in one night...

214
00:11:52,662 --> 00:11:55,961
Th-Than in the entire time
that we've owned this place!

215
00:11:56,032 --> 00:11:57,966
We have to
embrace the situation.

216
00:11:58,034 --> 00:11:59,968
<i>We should totally
embrace the situation!</i>

217
00:12:00,036 --> 00:12:01,947
- We're a gay bar from now on.
- Absolutely, man!

218
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:03,962
No goddamn way.

219
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,974
Have you guys seen this?

220
00:12:06,042 --> 00:12:08,977
"Looking for that new hot spot
to spot that stud?

221
00:12:09,045 --> 00:12:11,479
Well, Paddy's Irish Pub
has plugged that hole."

222
00:12:11,547 --> 00:12:13,481
- That's a nice notice.
- No, it's not nice.

223
00:12:13,549 --> 00:12:15,574
I don't want to be
plugging anybody's holes.

224
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:18,051
- I'm gonna have to agree with Mac.
- Of course you are.

225
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,680
I made $300 last night.
How much did you make?

226
00:12:20,756 --> 00:12:23,996
First of all, that's rude. And that has
nothing to do with what I'm talking about.

227
00:12:24,026 --> 00:12:25,960
It has everything to do with it.

228
00:12:26,028 --> 00:12:28,462
I don't think we have much of a choice.
We need to do this.

229
00:12:28,531 --> 00:12:32,900
If you guys remember, one of the major
reasons we got this bar was to get laid.

230
00:12:32,969 --> 00:12:36,248
<i>Maybe you did it to get laid. I got a little
something I like to call business ethics.</i>

231
00:12:36,272 --> 00:12:40,641
<i>Business ethics? The only reason you don't care
is you have black girls hanging all over you.</i>

232
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:44,809
Okay, chill out.
You're gonna screw it up.

233
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,747
Screw it up? I happen to have a date
with a nice young lady today.

234
00:12:47,817 --> 00:12:50,445
- Ouch.
- It's a purely fiscal decision.

235
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:53,579
Oh, bullshit. You don't care about the
money. You just like the attention.

236
00:12:53,656 --> 00:12:56,523
- What the hell is that supposed to mean?
- "Everybody look at me!"

237
00:12:56,592 --> 00:12:58,492
You know exactly
what I mean, pretty boy.

238
00:12:58,561 --> 00:13:00,461
- Hey, handsome.
- Hey, beautiful.

239
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:02,497
- Hey, sexy.
- Hey, hoss.

240
00:13:02,565 --> 00:13:06,001
- I just get along really well with those guys.
- They're vibing.

241
00:13:06,068 --> 00:13:09,799
No, you're leading them on.
You're not gay, you're just really vain.

242
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:12,841
Okay, time out. Here's what we should do.
Let's take a vote.

243
00:13:12,908 --> 00:13:14,842
<i>- Fine.
- Okay.</i>

244
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:18,175
All those in favor of Paddy's Pub
remaining a gay bar, say "aye."

245
00:13:18,247 --> 00:13:20,181
- Aye.
- Aye. Opposed?

246
00:13:20,249 --> 00:13:23,184
- K-K-Keeping in mind that you don't get a vote.
- Why?

247
00:13:23,252 --> 00:13:26,665
- Because you're the bartender. You're not one of the owners.
- No, Sweet Dee gets a vote.

248
00:13:26,689 --> 00:13:29,283
- No, she doesn't!
- Of course I get a vote!

249
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,529
All owners opposed, say "nay."

250
00:13:34,597 --> 00:13:37,532
All people who own the bar
who are opposed, say "nay."

251
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,467
All people who own the bar
who are opposed...

252
00:13:40,536 --> 00:13:42,504
say "nay."

253
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,140
Nay.

254
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:48,176
- Two against one! Oh, well.
- Ohh!

255
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:51,805
Paddy's Irish Pub will henceforth
remain the hottest gay bar in Philadelphia.

256
00:14:04,059 --> 00:14:06,493
- Hey-hey! What's going on?
- Hey!

257
00:14:06,562 --> 00:14:09,793
- Look at you! You look good!
- Oh, thank you. That's so sweet.

258
00:14:09,865 --> 00:14:12,800
- So, where we going?
- Well, I thought we'd go grab a drink.

259
00:14:12,868 --> 00:14:15,496
- Oh, I want one so bad.
- All righty!

260
00:14:15,571 --> 00:14:17,732
<i>Oh, a coffee shop.</i>

261
00:14:17,807 --> 00:14:20,401
I thought you meant,
like, a drink at a bar.

262
00:14:20,476 --> 00:14:23,309
Yeah, absolutely.
Uh, why don't you have a seat here.

263
00:14:23,379 --> 00:14:26,314
I'll go get the coffee.
What would you like?

264
00:14:26,382 --> 00:14:28,509
- I don't really drink coffee. Let me see.
- Totally.

265
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:35,522
What do you want, Charlie?

266
00:14:35,591 --> 00:14:37,559
"What do you want, Charlie?"

267
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:40,561
I'd like you to take a look at the
lovely young African-American woman...

268
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:42,392
sitting at the table over there.

269
00:14:43,499 --> 00:14:45,228
Okay.

270
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,428
That woman is my friend.

271
00:14:47,503 --> 00:14:49,528
Wow.
Good for you.

272
00:14:49,605 --> 00:14:52,540
So, the other day when you heard me
saying something...

273
00:14:52,608 --> 00:14:55,042
about certain people
hanging from said rafters...

274
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:57,977
I was quoting a friend of mine
who also happens...

275
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:00,982
What are you trying to say?
Spit it out.

276
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:04,486
Well, now that you know that I'm not
racist, you and I could maybe go on...

277
00:15:04,553 --> 00:15:06,487
Dude, N-O.

278
00:15:06,555 --> 00:15:09,490
- How many times do I have to say it to you?
- One time is fine.

279
00:15:09,558 --> 00:15:13,756
- Apparently one time is not fine.
- One time per time I ask you.

280
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:15,922
Hey, what's going on up here?

281
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:17,966
Oh, not too much.

282
00:15:18,033 --> 00:15:22,402
Charlie's using you to prove that he's not
racist. Then he asked me out on a date.

283
00:15:22,471 --> 00:15:25,201
Charlie, is this true?

284
00:15:27,243 --> 00:15:30,770
Would that upset you
if it was something that was true?

285
00:15:32,882 --> 00:15:35,817
- You need to see a doctor. This thing looks really bad.
- I did!

286
00:15:35,885 --> 00:15:39,321
- What'd he say?
- He said that Janell punched me in my eye!

287
00:15:39,388 --> 00:15:42,323
All right, well,
you need to keep that i...

288
00:15:42,391 --> 00:15:44,325
- Wait. Her name's Janell?
- Yeah.

289
00:15:44,393 --> 00:15:47,328
Janell Jenkins.
She's got a hell of a right hand.

290
00:15:47,396 --> 00:15:51,332
She also said if she ever saw me again,
she was going to slit my throat.

291
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,732
Are you two seeing this?

292
00:15:54,803 --> 00:15:56,794
Boys are out tonight, huh?

293
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:00,374
This is unbelievable.
What is going on here?

294
00:16:00,442 --> 00:16:03,309
You got black women
crawling all over you...

295
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,643
and this Mary here
is the belle of the ball.

296
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:08,774
- Why do these people like you guys so much?
- It's not that they like us.

297
00:16:08,851 --> 00:16:11,786
It's that they don't like you.
You know why?

298
00:16:11,854 --> 00:16:13,913
Uh, because you're an asshole!

299
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:18,893
Is that true?

300
00:16:18,961 --> 00:16:20,895
Yeah, kind of.

301
00:16:20,963 --> 00:16:23,295
Can I talk to you in back
for a second?

302
00:16:25,935 --> 00:16:29,371
- What's up?
- You know that girl Janell? I know her.

303
00:16:29,438 --> 00:16:33,135
- Okay. So what?
- So I think I know how we can solve this whole gay mess.

304
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:35,369
Great. How?

305
00:16:35,444 --> 00:16:38,379
We gotta start with Dennis. Can you
get him so drunk tonight? On tequila.

306
00:16:38,447 --> 00:16:41,507
But a lot of it.
Enough that maybe he might hurt himself.

307
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:43,552
- Yeah, sure. No problem.
- All right.

308
00:16:43,619 --> 00:16:47,180
- Where are you going?
- I gotta talk to a couple friends from my acting class.

309
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:49,884
But seriously...
blackout drunk.

310
00:16:56,632 --> 00:16:58,566
All right.
Okay.

311
00:16:58,634 --> 00:17:02,502
So you did the lime first,
and then the shot, right?

312
00:17:02,571 --> 00:17:05,131
No. No, no, no, no.
Dude.

313
00:17:05,207 --> 00:17:07,641
- You take the salt...
- Take the salt.

314
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:09,644
And then you take the shot.

315
00:17:09,712 --> 00:17:11,646
Okay.

316
00:17:11,714 --> 00:17:14,774
- And then you suck on the lime. Okay?
- Okay.

317
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:18,877
Why don't you show me again.
'Cause I'm getting a little bit confused.

318
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:21,821
- You lick it.
- Salt. Lick it.

319
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:23,881
- And then you slam it.
- Yeah?

320
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,700
Oh, that's great.

321
00:17:33,769 --> 00:17:36,237
All right, so,
I'm gonna do the shot first...

322
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:40,503
No, no, no, no... Oh... Oh, please,
please, dude. You're not listening to me.

323
00:17:40,576 --> 00:17:42,510
Well, I'm just not getting it, bro.

324
00:17:42,578 --> 00:17:44,512
- You do the salt first.
- The salt first.

325
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:47,515
- And then the lime.
- Show me again, because I'm not...

326
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:50,313
<i>The salt first.
Then the lime.</i>

327
00:18:06,402 --> 00:18:08,734
Oh, God.

328
00:18:13,909 --> 00:18:16,343
Hello.

329
00:18:16,412 --> 00:18:18,403
Mmm.

330
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:23,917
Nice.

331
00:18:25,254 --> 00:18:27,415
Beautiful.

332
00:18:32,795 --> 00:18:34,729
Hello, lover.

333
00:18:34,797 --> 00:18:36,731
Whoa!

334
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:39,529
What the hell!
What is going on here?

335
00:18:39,601 --> 00:18:42,934
Relax, stud. You got nothing
to be ashamed about.

336
00:18:43,005 --> 00:18:44,973
What the f...
What does that mean?

337
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,598
<i>- Did we have...
- No. No.</i>

338
00:18:46,675 --> 00:18:49,872
Don't be silly.
It was all hands.

339
00:18:49,945 --> 00:18:52,675
How's that ass feelin'?

340
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:57,982
<i>I'm really glad
you decided to embrace this.</i>

341
00:18:58,053 --> 00:19:00,988
- You're doing the right thing, bro.
- I think so too, dude.

342
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:03,923
- I feel really good about broadening my horizons.
- It's gonna be fun.

343
00:19:03,992 --> 00:19:06,017
- It's a good business decision.
- Yeah!

344
00:19:06,095 --> 00:19:09,997
I don't want to own
a gay bar anymore.

345
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:12,693
What, dude?
Oh, no. What happened?

346
00:19:12,768 --> 00:19:15,703
<i>Just, uh... I was doing
some thinking and, you know...</i>

347
00:19:15,771 --> 00:19:19,229
We had our little experiment. It was great.
But we should go back to normal.

348
00:19:19,308 --> 00:19:22,887
Oh. You had an experiment, and you want to go
back to the way it was before the experiment.

349
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:24,845
<i>- Interesting.
- The bar.</i>

350
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:28,576
We had our experiment with the bar,
and it was great. Let's go back to normal.

351
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:31,585
You're done experimenting?
Or are you gonna experiment some more?

352
00:19:31,653 --> 00:19:34,213
- What is this experimenting?
- Hey, Dennis! What's up?

353
00:19:34,289 --> 00:19:36,223
Listen, I got you some new CDs.

354
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:39,886
'Cause the music you had in the jukebox
was a little bit stale.

355
00:19:39,962 --> 00:19:42,226
Also, we gotta get rid
of these shamrocks.

356
00:19:42,297 --> 00:19:45,232
'Cause nothing scares gays and black folks
like Irish crap.

357
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:48,463
- Can we talk for a second in private?
- Yeah. No problem.

358
00:19:48,537 --> 00:19:52,405
So, listen, Terrell,
it's not really working out.

359
00:19:52,474 --> 00:19:54,999
- We're gonna have to let you go.
- I thought you were happy.

360
00:19:55,077 --> 00:19:59,810
<i>No, we were happy. But then Dennis had an
experiment, and he wants to go back to normal.</i>

361
00:19:59,882 --> 00:20:03,579
Yeah, we had that experiment...
Why do you keep saying it like that?

362
00:20:03,652 --> 00:20:05,552
You guys are being ridiculous.

363
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:08,488
Yeah, we're being ridiculous!
We're making a lot of money!

364
00:20:08,557 --> 00:20:11,117
- Yes! Thank you!
- Look, everybody! Sweet Dee's here!

365
00:20:11,193 --> 00:20:14,128
- Hey, everybody!
- Whoa! Whoa! What are you doing here?

366
00:20:14,196 --> 00:20:17,791
- Charlie?
- What is going on here? You guys know each other?

367
00:20:17,866 --> 00:20:20,198
Yeah! That's the crazy bitch
that punched me in my eye!

368
00:20:20,269 --> 00:20:22,601
Charlie!
That's my sister.

369
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:27,537
Now, just to clarify,
when you say "sister," you mean...

370
00:20:27,609 --> 00:20:30,009
I mean my sister.

371
00:20:30,078 --> 00:20:32,069
<i>Yes! Okay!
This is great!</i>

372
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:35,776
Because earlier
you were implying that I was racist...

373
00:20:35,851 --> 00:20:38,877
<i>because you thought that I was implying
that all black people are related.</i>

374
00:20:38,954 --> 00:20:41,445
And then it turns out
that you people actually are!

375
00:20:46,061 --> 00:20:50,054
<i>No, that's not what I meant. Hold on a
second. I meant that you two actually are.</i>

376
00:20:50,132 --> 00:20:53,465
Mac? Stop talkin'.

377
00:20:58,307 --> 00:21:01,470
Hundred and 11, hundred and 12,
hundred and 13...

378
00:21:01,543 --> 00:21:03,477
$114!

379
00:21:03,545 --> 00:21:05,479
- On a Saturday night!
- We're back to normal.

380
00:21:05,547 --> 00:21:07,481
We are back to normal.

381
00:21:07,549 --> 00:21:09,483
Mmm.

382
00:21:09,551 --> 00:21:11,485
Dee, I gotta know.

383
00:21:11,553 --> 00:21:15,489
What, exactly, did you tell those guys
from your acting class to do to Dennis?

384
00:21:15,557 --> 00:21:18,651
Oh, I forgot to tell you.
That didn't work out.

385
00:21:18,727 --> 00:21:21,992
- What?
- Yeah, I couldn't get ahold of those guys.

386
00:21:23,765 --> 00:21:26,097
Then why was he so freaked out?

387
00:21:26,168 --> 00:21:28,329
How's that ass feelin'?

387
00:21:29,305 --> 00:22:29,469
