00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,800
- If we can't find Bill Ward

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,240
before it releases the virus?

5
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:13,880
- We have to find him

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,640
if we want to have a future.

7
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,280
- Her pregnancy made the virus

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,200
more aggressive.

9
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,280
You did not know ?

10
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,600
- I'll take you to the ship,

11
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,960
they will save you, as we have seen.

12

Ultrasound beats

13
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,360
- Where is she ?

14
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,040
- On board one of our ships.

15
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,400
I know she carries the virus.

16
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,440
The ship will leave
and take them away.

17
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,840
You have failed.

18
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,000
My people will survive.

19
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,960
We will not be contaminated.

20
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,880
- They traveled back in time.

21
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,360
They look like us
because that's us.

22
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,440
Us in the future.

23
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,160
- It all started with Emily and Sacha.
These are the Adam and Eve

24
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,480
of the extraterrestrial kind.
They are the origin of the species.

25
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,520
- All this war of the worlds,

26
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,520
- All this war of the worlds,

27
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,720
it's our fault.

28
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:06,400
But we can end it.

29
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,920
- How? 'Or' What ?

30
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,880
- You're gonna have to kill me.

They believe they have won.

42
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,960

- Isla.

47
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,840
I want to discuss.

48
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,480
- What do you want to talk about?
- The past.

49
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,360
From the future too.

50
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,680
Please.

51
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,880
If we had wanted to kill you,
we would have already done it.

52
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,960
- Where did you get it?

53
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,400
- One of yours has gone
in an observatory in France.

54
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,400
- One of yours has gone
in an observatory in France.

55
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,360
He was looking for me.

56
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,400
- Micah.

57
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,240
- You know him ?

58
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,760
- He was the father of my children.

59
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,360
- I'm sorry.
           - Your friends killed him.

60
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,680
- No, your friends killed him.

61
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,440
- You're lying.
     - He wanted to end the conflict.

62
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,280
Your people did not accept it,
they killed him.

63
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,680
- No.
                      - It's the truth.

64
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,680
We all lost
loved ones.

65
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:36,200
Micah was convinced
that there was another solution.

66
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,760
Everything is here.

67
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,640
We need your help.

68
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,800
It would seem
let it be some kind of ...

69
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,760
way

70
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,760
back to the past.

71
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,640
We have to use it.

72
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,960
- I won't help you.

73
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:01,080
- You didn't kill me
when you have had the opportunity.

74
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,280
Why ?

75
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,040
- We must look to the future.

76
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,160
- What future holds us
this war ?

77
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,960
We can't do it without you.

78
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,440
- I refuse to help you.

79
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,640
It would be a betrayal.

80
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,600
Are you going to kill me then?
- No.

81
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,440
There have been too many deaths already.

82
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,320
I'm exhausted.

83
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,000
Go ahead, talk.

84
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,720
If you want.

85
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,720
You can make a difference.

86
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,840
That's what Micah wanted.

87
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,000
Let her go, Zoe.

88
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,520
Zoe.

89
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,840
Leave her.

- No !

95
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,400
- Let go of me !

96
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,000
Leave me.

97
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,920
We're going to die here.
- We'll be together.

98
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,840
- You really don't understand.

99
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,240
I hate you !

100
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,400
- We have time to love each other.

101
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,880
Emily.

102
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,560
We have all the time in the world.

103
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,840
- If we restructure the virus,

104
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,160
we can modify it
to target humans.

105
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,800
- I thought it was over.

106
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,400
- With this weapon, we will eliminate
the last survivors.

107
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,000
Our fighters will no longer die
by facing them.

108
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,280
- Micah died like that?

109
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,440
- Yes.

110
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,720
- You lie.

111
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,400
- Isla.

112
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,040
- Tell me how he died.

113
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,560
Tell me.

114
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,200
- Micah was no longer in agreement
with our action.

115
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,560
His ideas were dangerous.

116
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,480
Jokim had to intervene.

117
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,800
- Jokim killed him?

118
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,880
Shall we kill ours?

119
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,120
- Micah betrayed us.

120
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,600
Isla.

121
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,480
I understand your pain.

122
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,800
- Sometimes I say to myself ...

123
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,160
that we were cursed
before we were born.

124
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,560
- We're healed.

125
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,880
You have a child of your own.

126
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,520
- Because we killed his parents.

127
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,480
They were massacred.

128
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,760
We have gone too far.

129
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,160

to have a future.

00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,720
Isla, are you there?

134
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,400
My wife's name was ...

135
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,080
Helen.

136
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,800
* When our son was killed,

137
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,360
I made him the promise
to exterminate you all,

138
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,880
without knowing if I was capable of it.

139
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,760
All I wanted

140
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,680
it was that she loves me.

141
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,880
I never wanted anything else.

142
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,080
But I was too stupid
to realize it.

143
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,320
I'm engaged
to annihilate your people.

144
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,800
Because I did not know how to return
my happy wife.

145
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,640
For God Sake...

146
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,600
It's completely twisted.

147
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,560
It's the same with Dan.

148
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,600
I never realized

149
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,280
how much I loved my son.

150
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,520
Until he disappears.

151
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,200
Until it's too late.

152
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,480
But you,

153
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,520
you couldn't see
your children live.

154
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,720
It's cruel.

155
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,520
Finally...

156
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:41,000
I doubt
that you are listening.

157
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,160
But I...

158
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,720
I wanted to tell you.

159
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,960
* - Yes, I'm listening to you.

160
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,480
Where are you ?

161
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,320
That's it.

162
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,880
I told Bill Ward I was coming.

163
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,240
- I know
that you are angry with me for Micah.

164
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,840
We couldn't let him
compromise everything.

165
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,320
- I want a new life

166
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,120
for me and my baby.

167
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,760
- You'll have it.

168
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,600
Trust me.

169
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,000
As soon as we kill Bill Ward.

170
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:50,400

00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,960

00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,640
- I don't know.

173
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,280
- She's one of them.

174
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,720
- This is total madness.

175
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,600
You don't even know if it will work.

176
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,640
- I was told to have faith.

177
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,280
- I saw churches
full of dead.

178
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,920
The faith,
that does not prevent being killed.

179
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,240
Mechanical clicks

180
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,920
- Wait till I come in.

181
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,840
I will occupy them.

182
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,680
Tension music

183
00:13:28,840 --> 00:14:06,920
---

184
00:13:28,840 --> 00:14:06,920
---

185
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,480
- Where's Isla?

186
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:29,440
---

187
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,120
- You are alone ?
- Yes.

188
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,680
Here are the formulas that Micah
used for transposition.

189
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,480
They determine a destination.

190
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,480
They determine a destination.

191
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,600
- When?

192
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,480
- I dunno.
If Micah wanted to change things,

193
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:09,480
it is necessarily in the past,
before we arrived on Earth.

194
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,560
- But why was he looking for me?

195
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,840
- Your name is transmitted
from generation to generation.

196
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,600
You are known as the one
who wanted to exterminate our people

197
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,160
and push our ancestors
to leave Earth.

198
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,800
- But that's absurd!

199
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:26,160
- You can't deny the role
that you played.

200
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,880
We don't know everything
the past.

201
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,480
Micah thought
that you would know more.

202
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,680
- You know how to make this trip?

203
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,920
- Our ships are alive.
They change and evolve.

204
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,040
They will lead the way.

205
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:47,240
- We have to go to the past
finish Micah's job.

206
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,480
- I will go.

207
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,440
I will do it.

208
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:58,080
- Are you sure ?
         - No, but you have to devote yourself.

209
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,760
How will I know what to do?

210
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,560
- Micah chose a location.

211
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,680
Over there,
the solution will be imposed on you.

212
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,360
- Break the time loop.

213
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,280
- That's it.

214
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,560
- But will there be
another myself?

215
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,360
Will I be duplicated?

216
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,160
- I think it's impossible.

217
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,000
Micah would have known how to answer you.

218
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,040
- So we don't know
what to expect ?

219
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,040
- Micah thought
that was the only solution.

220
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,560
I never doubted
of his judgment.

221
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,080
Intriguing music

222
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,280
- That was for you.

223
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,800
For your baby.

224
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,600
- It's so you.

225
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,440
- What we are about to do,

226
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,640
if it ever works,

227
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,440
your baby will never exist.

228
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,800
- I know.

229
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,360
- I promised you a future.

230
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,960
For you,

231
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,640
for you.

232
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,280
- It wasn't fate.

233
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:47,320
- Things will come back to where
they were there before, between us.

234
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,400
We will hardly speak to each other and ...

235
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,920
when we talk to each other
we will argue.

236
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,400
- It will be up to us to do better.

237
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,760
- If we don't?

238
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,440
- I'll pick up.

239
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,480
I'll be clean.

240
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,960
You,
you might fall in love.

241
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,840
It will transform you.

242
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,320
- It's possible ?
   - Yeah.

243
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,640
It has happened once before.

244
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,480
It can happen again.

245
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,640
- I'll miss you.

246
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,120
I love you so strong.

247
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,720
- Me too.

248
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,280
Sad soft music

249
00:18:48,440 --> 00:19:03,960
---

250
00:18:48,440 --> 00:19:03,960
---

251
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,760
Sobs

252
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,560
- I always wanted to be a dad.

253
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,760
- You will be.

254
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,760
Fair...

255
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:26,320
in a better world than this.

256
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,120
Your children will be happy.

257
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,200
They will be safe.
- Yeah.

258
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,280
But it will be without you.

259
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:52,280
---

260
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,200
- It's not sure that it works?

261
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,080
What if you die?

262
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,400
- It's a risk
that I cannot avoid.

263
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,400
- It's a risk
that I cannot avoid.

264
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:07,880
- We can do otherwise.
       - It'll give me a chance.

265
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,960
Helen and Dan will be alive.
And you will see your mother again.

266
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,600
Worth the cost to try.

267
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,920
- You're afraid ?

268
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,480
- Yes.

269
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,680
- When we go back,
will we know each other more?

270
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,360
- You might go to college
and I will be your teacher.

271
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,600
- I want to study communication.

272
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:41,120
- Communication, help.

273
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,840
---

274
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,480
Don't waste your life like me.

275
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,400
Make the most of it.

276
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,240
- I'm going to try.

277
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,640
- You're a good person, Tom.

278
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:12,880
---

279
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,880
Heavy music

280
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:27,640
---

281
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:52,280
---

282
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:55,920
- Isla!

283
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,560
Fire

284
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,400
- Go for it !

285
00:22:22,160 --> 00:23:11,600
---

286
00:22:22,160 --> 00:23:11,600
---

287
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,840
- Let's go back to the ship.

288
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:40,240
- To activate the ship,
rest your hands on the console.

289
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,760
I have to go.

290
00:23:49,920 --> 00:24:18,080
...

291
00:23:49,920 --> 00:24:18,080
...

292
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,800
Ultrasound beats

293
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:36,880
---
                    ---

294
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,240
Metallic squeak

295
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,520
Ultrasound beats

296
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:53,880
---

297
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:34,040
...

298
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,120
- Ah, you're awake.

299
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,040
How are you feeling ?

300
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,000
- Dan?

301
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,920
I am so happy to see you.

302
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:00,200
- We found you unconscious
in front of the hospital.

303
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,800
Do you remember?

304
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,960
Dad ?
         - Did you talk to your mother?

305
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,080
- Yes, I warned her.

306
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,760
She's worried about you.

307
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,440
- And her, how are you?

308
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,680
- Yes, very well.

309
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,720
I'll get a doctor.

310
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:27,960
- Dan.

311
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,120
I am really very proud of you.

312
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,360
I love you.

313
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,320
- OKAY.

314
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,520
- Sign there, please.

315
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,720
Thank you sir.

316
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,280
- Emily ...

317
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,800
- Three, we lift.
- What do we have?

318
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,280
- Gunshot wound to the abdomen.
Voltage at 8.6. Heart at 110.

319
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,440
Quickly, she's losing a lot of blood.

320
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:33,680
...

321
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,520
Tension music

322
00:27:36,680 --> 00:28:10,480
---

323
00:27:36,680 --> 00:28:10,480
---

324
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,400
- Emily and Sacha.

325
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:24,560
These are the Adam and Eve
of the extraterrestrial kind.

326
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,000
They are at the origin of it.

327
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,120
The whole story is linked
at this very moment

328
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,520
where they are mounted
aboard the vessel.

329
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:42,000
- Over there,
the solution will be imposed on you.

330
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,440
- Break the time loop.

331
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:53,640
---

332
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,760
- I hear a noise.

333
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,560
And I see flashes.

334
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,560
And I see flashes.

335
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,240
- When did it start?

336
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,720
- This morning.

337
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,080
I see things.

338
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,960
- Hallucinations,

339
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,640
it is quite common.
     - They're not hallucinations.

340
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,160
It looks like the real thing.

341
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:29,920
---

342
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,400
- I can assist you ?

343
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,440
- Where's Bill Ward?

344
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,920
- He went out.

345
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:42,760
---

346
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:45,240
Ultrasound beats

347
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:56,760
---

348
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,360
- Emily is here.
He's going to break the time loop.

349
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,520
You have to find it.

350
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:27,120
---

351
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:31,840
Sobs

352
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,960
- It's not okay ?

353
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,360
- They think I'm crazy.

354
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,600
- Why ?

355
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,880
- Are you a doctor here?

356
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,520
- Yes that's it.

357
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,680
Why would you be mad?

358
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,960
- I see things.

359
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,920
- Like what ? Which things ?

360
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,800
Do not worry,

361
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,800
you can tell me everything.

362
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,360
- I see...

363
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,760
I see corpses in the streets.

364
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,000
I see myself with strangers

365
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,360
doing things

366
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,720
than I have ever done.

367
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,280
I do not understand,

368
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,440
I feel it in my body.

369
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,040
It's like I'm there.

370
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,640
You too,
you think I'm crazy.

371
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,960
- No no.

372
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,560
Far from there.

373
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,760
Come, I'll take you home.

374
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,640
Come on, take my arm.

375
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,720
- Thank you.

376
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:24,080
...

377
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,320
Where are we?

378
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,680
Why are we outside?

379
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,160
- These things...

380
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,720
The things you see ...

381
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,760
it is the future.

382
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,200
I...

383
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,360
I know that sounds crazy.

384
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,520
But it's the truth.

385
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:58,040
- I would like to go home,
take me home.

386
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,920
Come with me.
             - I am sorry,

387
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,600
Emily, I can't.

388
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,280
- Do you know my name?

389
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,520
- What you see,
I lived it.

390
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,400
And you too.

391
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:17,040
The corpses in the streets,
it's actually going to happen.

392
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,960
- You are scaring me.
              - I have to prevent all this

393
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,480
or billions of humans
going to die.

394
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:32,200
I have to change the events
to save those we love.

395
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,200
They won't know.

396
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,800
- What are you doing ?

397
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,680
- Sorry, Emily.

398
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,480
I see no other solution.

399
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:33,440
...

400
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,120
Dramatic music

401
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:51,120
---

402
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,760
- I love you.

403
00:35:52,920 --> 00:36:15,360
---

404
00:35:52,920 --> 00:36:15,360
---

405
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,800
- Look around for him.

406
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,520
- Please step back.

407
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,720
- Go back inside.
- Please,

408
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,120
step aside.

409
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:42,360
Dramatic music
Ultrasound beats

---

412
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,840
- Dad ?

413
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,920
Where were you ?

414
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:26,440
I waited for you...
      - I did a horrible thing.

415
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,120
Horrible...
- What did you do ?

416
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,560
- I did it for you.
For your mother.

417
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,040
For everyone.

418
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,440
- What are you talking about ?

419
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,040
- If I tell you,
you will find it inconsistent.

420
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,600
But I had no choice.

421
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,360
It was the only solution.

422
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,840
Vibrator

423
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,600
- That's the job. I will be back.

424
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:01,120

425
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:01,120

426
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:32,960
...

427
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,040
- Hi.
                 - It's okay ?

428
00:38:36,840 --> 00:39:00,560
...

429
00:38:36,840 --> 00:39:00,560
...

430
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,320
All the music in the world
just a click away

431
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,440
and we can't choose.

432
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,080
- Do you know what it's called?

433
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,080
It is the paralysis of choice.

434
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:15,400
Like when you go to the supermarket
for toothpaste,

435
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:19,080
a hundred possible choices and you want
just brush your teeth.

436
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:24,880
- I have friends
who spend this weekend.

437
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:29,640
Will you come for a drink?
- I have to work.

438
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,920
- If you're fed up

439
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,360
and you want to have fun ...

440
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,600
- We'll see.

441
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,440
- You want some coffee ?
               - Yes thanks.

442
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:52,600
Call tone

443
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,480
---

444
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,560
Come on, Sophia.
Take your phone.

445
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,240
Vibrator

446
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:13,600
---

447
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,240
- Dad ?

448
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:34,480
- Was there an event?
Is it on the news?

449
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,240
- About what ?

450
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,440
- They detected a signal
which proves

451
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,400
the existence of aliens?

452
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,080
- Not that I know.

453
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,040
- I managed to prevent it.

454
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,000
Bill sighs.

455
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,000
Everything will be alright.

456
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,960
It will be alright.

457
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,960
Melancholy music

458
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:16,000
---

459
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:35,120
- I brought you breakfast.

460
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,160
- Max is sleeping.

461
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,760
- I beg your pardon.

462
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,760
- I beg your pardon.

463
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,360
I shouldn't have talked to you like that.

464
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,040
- I can't blame you.

465
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,880
Your life is quiet without me.

466
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:20,120
- Let's say it's easier
and that my apartment is better tidy.

467
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,840
But...

468
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,120
it's empty.

469
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,640
Don't you want to come home?

470
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:40,840
I want to help you.

471
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,040
- What's in it?

472
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,280
- Of all.

473
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:19,400
...

474
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:24,400
- Helen.

475
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:30,000
- Bill. Dan told me
that you had been unwell. It's okay ?

476
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,800
- Yes, it was nothing at all.
I'm fine.

477
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:39,600
I know
that it's complicated between us ...

478
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:42,400
I wanted to ask you to ...

479
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:44,440
to apologize.

480
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,880
- We've had this conversation before.

481
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:51,480
- Until now,
I only thought of myself,

482
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:53,320
to what I needed.

483
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:56,480
I never knew
take into account your needs.

484
00:43:58,480 --> 00:43:59,480
I was selfish.

485
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:01,760
- Good, thank you.

486
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:05,880
It's not all your fault.

487
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:09,080
- I finally understood
what is important.

488
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,120
It's you, Helen.

489
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:12,880
You and Dan.

490
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:15,840
Always.

491
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:20,320
I would have preferred
realize this earlier.

492
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:25,120
- I have to go.

493
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,040
- Glad to see you.

494
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:37,360

00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:16,680
- Bill.

499
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:19,080
- The virus,

500
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:21,440
he's in the lab.

501
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:23,960
Emily ...

502
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:28,920
- Where are you going ?

503
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:56,000

504
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:59,480
A teacher arrested

506
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:08,120
- Bill.

507
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:11,320
Where are you going ?
