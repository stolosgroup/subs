1
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,320
- Four months ago

2
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:12,560
a black hole has appeared at the edge of our exosphere.

3
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,080
This is proof that our theories

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,720
about the plurality of worlds and dimensions are true.

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,640
- The presence of the black hole would cause a bunch of people

6
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,960
around the world have visions?

7
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,560
- It's not a coincidence.

8
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,840
- We must go past the black hole to collect

9
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:30,880
Datas.

10
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,400
- To do what ? - Explain its appearance.

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,840
- Your names?

12
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,160
Cris

13
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,000
Scary music

14
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,400
...

15
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,600
- So ? You have it ?

16
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:44,880
- Zoe ?

17
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,920
I see myself with a girl.

18
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,000
- Emily Gresham ?

19
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,240
- The guy who killed her...

20
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,880
I have already seen it. - Bill Ward.

21
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,640
You pushed her off the roof. Why ?

22
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,200
- To prevent attacking.

23
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,400
They came from the future.

24
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,320
Thanks to their technology I went back in time.

25
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,440
I killed Emily, it was the only way I killed Emily, it was the only way

26
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,720
to prevent their species from being born.

27
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,600
- Why do we see these things? - Surely a problem.

28
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,720
- Who are they?

29
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,160
- When I went back in time,

30
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,120
some traveled with me.

31
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,240
- Don't, finish it.

32
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:23,560
...

33
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,960
Honk

34
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:30,600
...

35
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,840
Soft, disturbing music

36
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:52,320
...

37
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

38
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,840
*- Have you ever been to Italy?

39
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,800
- I lived in Rome for a while.

40
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,080
Check the setting.

41
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,640
*- Yes, boss.

42
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,040
- Alignment should be 5 and a quarter turns.

43
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,560
*- Well received.

44
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,080
Sensor Alignment:

45
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,920
2-0-4-3.

46
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,800
*Why did you live in Rome?

47
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,360
- I was with an Italian.

48
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,720
*- He was in love with his mother?

49
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,720
- The alignment is good.

50
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,480
- OK. Well received.

51
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,640
*- One hour ahead, well done!

52
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,920
You can go up.

53
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,800
*- You didn't answer,

54
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,400
for his mother.

55
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,640
*- I refuse

56
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,800
to perpetuate cultural clichÃ©s.

57
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,000
*- I take that as a yes. *- I take that as a yes.

58
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,960
- Take it as you want.

59
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,440
*Richard ?

60
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,320
You hear me ?

61
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,760
...

62
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,600
Richard ?

63
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:38,800
...

64
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,560
gasping breath

65
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,440
- It will.

66
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,080
*- What happened ?

67
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,560
- I do not really know...

68
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,360
- Come back to the airlock.

69
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:02,640
... ...

70
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,240
*- I have something in my helmet...

71
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,520
It's water.

72
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,160
*I have water

73
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,600
in my helmet.

74
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,040
- You must have damaged your jumpsuit when you fell.

75
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,720
Your oxygen rate and level are good.

76
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,840
*Go to the airlock.

77
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,160
- I feel it behind my head.

78
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,440
- You're almost there.

79
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,040
He moans.

80
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:40,920
...

81
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,160
He chokes.

82
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,480
He's coughing.

83
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,880
...

84
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:47,960
Quoi ?

85
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,720
...

86
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,280
- I can't breathe...

87
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,120
I can't breathe!

88
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,240
- Put your head down.

89
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,720
*Quick ! *Quick !

90
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,120
Turn around !

91
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,440
Turn around !

92
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,360
Head down !

93
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,720
gasping moaning

94
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:17,280
...

95
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,600
Richard !

96
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,520
Sigh

97
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,480
- Its good.

98
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,040
- Take the security cable to find the airlock.

99
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,960
(OK...)

100
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:48,840
*- I'm there.

101
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,640
(- OK...)

102
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,360
You could have drowned.

103
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,600
- Dying like that in space, it's comical.

104
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,160
- It's not funny.

105
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,240
You weren't answering.

106
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,600
What happened ?

107
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,080
- Images appeared to me.

108
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,680
Like a hallucination.

109
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,880
- What did you see ?

110
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,360
- The whole station was shaking.

111
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,520
And then there was an explosion.

112
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,640
You were sucked into space.

113
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,840
- It's probably the CO2.

114
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,080
- It sounded so real.

115
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,680
- Your oxygen level was normal.

116
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,240
Check your sensors.

117
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,960
- We were close to the black hole.

118
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,240
- Do you think there's a connection?

119
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,640
- I don't know.

120
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,360
- I'm going to check the sensors on your suit.

121
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,640
music of suspense

122
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:32,720
...

123
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,200
- He's getting weaker and weaker.

124
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,160
- He rejects the new organs.

125
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,640
Soon we will all be like him.

126
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,600
- How much time do we have left?

127
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,520
- That, I don't know.

128
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,440
He still needs blood.

129
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,800
- We need to find another donor.

130
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:00,400
- The donor must be compatible, Emily's brother is perfect. - The donor must be compatible, Emily's brother is perfect.

131
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,120
Our mutations are not present in his DNA.

132
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,680
- Tom will find out.

133
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,440
- We can't attack without him.

134
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,800
- OK. I continue.

135
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,000
- Beryllium attenuates matter waves.

136
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,960
- Can we give it a try?

137
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,240
- Soon, I think.

138
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,720
- You borrow 1,000 pounds from your bank

139
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,720
and they take you

140
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,760
5% compound interest.

141
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,800
How much do you owe them after...

142
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,120
3 years ?

143
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,240
- No bank

144
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,240
would lend me money.

145
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,240
- OK.

146
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,760
So let's say, your dealer,

147
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:50,560
you owe him 1,000 pounds and he takes 5% interest.

148
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,200
- Guy, I don't know your dealer,

149
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,520
but if I owe 1,000 bucks to mine,

150
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,960
he breaks my legs.

151
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,800
- Whoever you want, but answer.

152
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,160
- 5 %...

153
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,920
of 1,000...

154
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,240
That's 50.

155
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,120
- Parfait !

156
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:14,760
Now you add the 50 to the 1,000...

157
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,840
We unlock the gate.

158
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,680
- It's for you.

159
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,400
- Why are you coming back?

160
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,400
- I questioned the woman who was arrested at the police station.

161
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,320
I told her that I knew who she was and where she came from.

162
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,680
That I knew they were planning an attack.

163
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,720
- What did she answer?

164
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,520
- She tried to kill me.

165
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:02,160
- Of course, it's the truth. All the truth. - Of course, it's the truth. All the truth.

166
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,640
- I believe what you tell me.

167
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,320
He sighs.

168
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,680
They broke into a lab and stole beryllium

169
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,760
What do they do with it? - I don't know.

170
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,640
It's a neutron reflector.

171
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,680
- Help me understand what they're up to.

172
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,680
- Can you release me?

173
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,720
- I don't have that power.

174
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,040
- Get me out of here. - You killed.

175
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,200
- If you want help, get me out of here.

176
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,400
- Think of your wife and son.

177
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,320
- Ex wife.

178
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,760
- Killing Emily will have been for nothing if we don't stop them.

179
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,160
- If that's your goal, you have to free me.

180
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,080
- I don't have the power!

181
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,440
- Good.

182
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,560
So figure it out for yourself. So figure it out for yourself.

183
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,920
- Bill...

184
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,120
- Ready?

185
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,200
What did the doctors say?

186
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,840
- They're thinking about suicide.

187
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,720
- You don't believe it?

188
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,120
- Non.

189
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,240
She was in another world.

190
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,400
She found herself in front of this truck

191
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,680
because for her, he was not there.

192
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,160
- Your combi filter was clogged.

193
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,000
It caused the leak.

194
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,240
Usually it takes longer before guys

195
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,000
start ignoring me.

196
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,720
- Excuse me.

197
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,520
- What are you reading ?

198
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,400
- An article written by a French astrophysicist.

199
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,920
Black hole gravitational waves

200
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,200
would affect people's conscience.

201
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,000
- You think that was it?

202
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,480
You are going a bit far.

203
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,760
- Not that much.

204
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,680
Hawking radiation is a real phenomenon,

205
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,320
we have seen and measured it.

206
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:41,120
- You start from Hawking radiation to explain

207
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,600
des hallucinations ?

208
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,120
- If there is a link between consciousness and quantum entanglement,

209
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,640
these electrons would become entangled with others

210
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,320
in the nucleus of our brain cells.

211
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,240
- What do you think happened to you?

212
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,280
- What if I had been connected with a world beyond the black hole? - What if I had been connected with a world beyond the black hole?

213
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,480
Gravitational waves would have sent

214
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,440
my consciousness in another space-time.

215
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,080
Do you take me for a fool?

216
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:20,200
- We are in a box in orbit, the notion of madness is relative.

217
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,960
You were high on CO2.

218
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,880
- You checked the sensors,

219
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,160
they were OK.

220
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,800
- Maybe it's just space sickness.

221
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,160
You are hungry ?

222
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,360
- Yeah, come on.

223
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,600
- Where were you ?

224
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,720
I waited for you.

225
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:45,760
- Listen...

226
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,960
excuse me, I'm not in the mood.

227
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,880
- My exams are coming up, and you're planting me.

228
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,400
- I already helped you.

229
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,960
You wanna know what I did?

230
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,600
I sacrificed everything

231
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,040
for little wankers like you. for little wankers like you.

232
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,360
- Kiss my ass. - I don't have to deal with you.

233
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,000
I am not your father.

234
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,960
moans of pain

235
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:20,560
...

236
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,200
Soft music

237
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,880
...

238
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:32,200
- I remember when they brought you home from the hospital.

239
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,200
- Do you remember that? - Sure.

240
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,200
You were so little.

241
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,320
All beautiful.

242
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,440
I always wanted...

243
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,440
... hold you in my arms.

244
00:14:45,640 --> 00:15:00,600
... ...

245
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,040
Sigh

246
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:30,520
...

247
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,160
*- For the attention of Dr Durand, here Richard Gallagher,

248
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,080
aboard the ISS.

249
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,840
ESA sent me your article.

250
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,880
I think your theory is plausible.

251
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,840
During an outing, I had a vision,

252
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,280
while I was near the black hole.

253
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,400
Electrons emerge from the black hole by Hawking radiation. Electrons emerge from the black hole by Hawking radiation.

254
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,800
Why not admit

255
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
the curvature of the black hole spacetime

256
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,200
leads to a kind of door

257
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:14,000
that leads to another universe, another time?

258
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,480
That would explain what all these people are seeing.

259
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,520
I think we have the means to prove it.

260
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,040
Hawking's formula is probably wrong.

261
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,680
Electrons emit a net magnetic charge.

262
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,320
This is the magnetic monopole

263
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,120
that we detected.

264
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,880
*The formula explains the formation of the black hole.

265
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,840
In theory, we could use this formula

266
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,000
to generate TeV-scale micro-black holes.

267
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,000
A particle accelerator

268
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,840
could reproduce the phenomenon

269
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:57,280
and open a passage to another world.

270
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,920
We open the door. We open the door.

271
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,920
- I received the message from an astronaut from the ISS.

272
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,840
It's incredible.

273
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:17,280
The monopole bends spacetime and creates a black hole.

274
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,120
- Tu bosses ?

275
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,520
- You know Ella Van Cleemput,

276
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,440
in Oxford? Convince her to leave me

277
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,040
use their particle accelerator.

278
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:29,880
- Why ?

279
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,680
- We could access a world where Sophia is still alive.

280
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,160
- Catherine...

281
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,640
listen to me,

282
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,400
You should make time for...

283
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,360
to grieve.

284
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:46,800
- So I feel sorry for 2 weeks and then I work?

285
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,200
- You can't have clear ideas.

286
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,240
- I can only do that.

287
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,720
I see problems and try to solve them.

288
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,640
It's vital for me to get there. It's vital for me to get there.

289
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,520
- In this case,

290
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,080
I will contact Ella.

291
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,920
- I'm sorry, I shouldn't have looked.

292
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,600
- There is no harm.

293
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:41,360
I should put all this away, but I can't find the time.

294
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,960
- Is he your boyfriend?

295
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,800
- No, he was my boyfriend. We separated.

296
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,200
- Why ?

297
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,440
- He thought I was too passionate.

298
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,400
It's a flaw, apparently.

299
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,600
- Ah.

300
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,920
- No, but it's okay, don't worry.

301
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,200
I'm surprised it lasted this long.

302
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,840
- What are you going to do for Bill?

303
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,760
- It was clear. It won't help me as long as...

304
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,760
I wouldn't have had him released.

305
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:17,960
- No one can help you

306
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,160
to get him out?

307
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,240
- Non.

308
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,120
If we notice it, it's the direct door

309
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,960
- I thought of Emily.

310
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,280
- Does this happen to you often?

311
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,560
- By period.

312
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,000
Do you remember ? She had a brother.

313
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,280
Can you find him?

314
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,400
- Why ?

315
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,520
- If it all started with Emily, maybe he can help us.

316
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:01,760
- Ella will make the accelerator available to you. - Ella will make the accelerator available to you.

317
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,360
- Thanks a lot.

318
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,400
- She'll be expecting you tomorrow.

319
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,400
She is good.

320
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,640
You should eat.

321
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,640
What is this poster?

322
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,200
- Sophia had it in her room.

323
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,080
It's inspired by Monet's Poppies.

324
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,080
You should come to Oxford with me.

325
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,040
- You want me to come with you ?

326
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,120
- If you have things to do, it doesn't matter.

327
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,480
- Non.

328
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,960
- I wish I wasn't alone.

329
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,120
- OK.

330
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:00,640
Intriguing music Intriguing music

331
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,040
OK.

332
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:32,120
...

333
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,440
- Zoe ?

334
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,600
- I found it.

335
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:58,840
...

336
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,440
- How are you, mate? - How are you, mate?

337
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,400
- Apart from my broken ribs, yes.

338
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,120
- Why didn't you drool on me?

339
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,640
- The snitches are always blowing their noses.

340
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,840
Do you have something to tell me?

341
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,480
- You said you would help me and you're pissing me off,

342
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,080
you calculate me more.

343
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,040
- Do you want me to apologize?

344
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,520
You broke my ribs.

345
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:41,040
- You say you take care of me and then you leave me?

346
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,760
It's not happening, man.

347
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,880
So ? What do you do ?

348
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,360
- In the room at 4 p.m.

349
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,320
- Serious ?

350
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,560
- Serious.

351
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,400
And I want the noodles and the cheese chips back.

352
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,000
- It should.

353
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,720
Except that I ate it.

354
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,120
- It should.

355
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:53,240
...

356
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,480
- We have a meeting

357
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,320
with Ella at 3 p.m.

358
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,360
- How did you know her?

359
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,080
- We used to go out together in college. - We used to go out together in college.

360
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,520
- Oh yes ?

361
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,720
- In distant times,

362
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,480
I had a love life.

363
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,960
- We're registered. 3rd floor.

364
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,160
I'm here.

365
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:47,720
...

366
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,800
- You have my key.

367
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,960
Annoying hesitation

368
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,600
- OK.

369
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,280
- See you at the reception?

370
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,040
- Yeah, let's do that.

371
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:25,680
...

372
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:28,640
Intriguing music

373
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:47,240
...

374
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,520
You were right.

375
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,920
I should listen to others more. They make me feel like

376
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,880
to be stupid.

377
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,040
- I don't know any smarter than you.

378
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,680
- In science, yes,

379
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,040
but with people, I have trouble. but with people, I have trouble.

380
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,560
You have always been admired.

381
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,920
It was easy for you.

382
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,840
I was jealous.

383
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,800
I took refuge in books, but...

384
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,960
I still haven't come out of my hiding place.

385
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,640
- You make more attempts than before.

386
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,800
What happened to his girlfriend?

387
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,080
- You want to see ?

388
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,760
- Oui.

389
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:41,600
...

390
00:26:41,800 --> 00:27:07,880
... ...

391
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,960
- Johannes !

392
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,840
So happy to see you!

393
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,760
- Oh !

394
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,840
Me too. Thanks for the slot.

395
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,960
- You're welcome. - This is Katherine.

396
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,920
- We met in Amsterdam.

397
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,240
- I don't remember you.

398
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,080
Johannes and you

399
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,480
have been together.

400
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,080
- That's right.

401
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,400
ca ski lift

402
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,720
quite a few years.

403
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,440
I have already registered you.

404
00:27:36,480 --> 00:28:18,640
... ...

405
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,960
I will give you the required IDS protocol

406
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,440
for the particle accelerator.

407
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,600
- Tom ?

408
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,640
- We know each other ?

409
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:44,280
- My name is Karim. I would like to talk to you about Emily.

410
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,160
- Why ?

411
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:51,760
- The tattoo on her wrist, you know why she chose it?

412
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,560
- Why ?

413
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:58,000
- Do you see things you don't understand?

414
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,120
Me, I see myself with Emily,

415
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,720
but I never met her.

416
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,040
- I have to go.

417
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,800
- Tom! - Hey!

418
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,360
- My number.

419
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,920
It's just my number. I would really like

420
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,680
to be able to tell you about Emily.

421
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,920
Call when you're ready.

422
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:49,000
...

423
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,480
Sigh

424
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,320
He refuses to talk to me.

425
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,080
- You seem surprised.

426
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,960
A stranger in the street questions him

427
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,840
about his sister who was killed. about his sister who was killed.

428
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,920
- I think he recognized me.

429
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,640
- Maybe he wants to forget.

430
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,080
It can be understood.

431
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,560
- I need to see Zoe.

432
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,960
- And you want me to be the driver for that too?

433
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,360
Don't get me wrong, I'm not an Uber.

434
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:37,080
- It is necessary to reproduce the frequency of Richard.

435
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,360
It will make the monopoles more stable.

436
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,320
- And the black micro-holes?

437
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,480
- If Richard is right,

438
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,080
they form naturally in space.

439
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,720
- Nobody's ever done that.

440
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,120
If it doesn't work? - We start again.

441
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,840
I want to know if Sophia is still alive.

442
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:03,440
The speed is accelerating.

443
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,480
- We are approaching the maximum velocity.

444
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,360
Alarm

445
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:22,160
...

446
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,240
The speed is accelerating.

447
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,800
- Black holes form.

448
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,360
Alarm

449
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,840
...

450
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,560
The speed is accelerating.

451
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,480
Alarm

452
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,840
...

453
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,040
- That works.

454
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:42,440
The speed is accelerating.

455
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,720
...

456
00:31:54,840 --> 00:32:12,880
... ...

457
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,800
The speed suddenly drops.

458
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,720
Scary music

459
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:38,400
...

460
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:42,640
Distant alarm

461
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,560
...

462
00:32:47,520 --> 00:33:31,080
... ...

463
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,920
- What is happening ?

464
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,280
Catherine ?

465
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,760
- I should have done more.

466
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,440
I should have tried to help you.

467
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,440
I beg your pardon.

468
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:56,440
- What are you talking about ? - I should have been there.

469
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:00,240
I could have stopped you. - Stop me from what? I could have stopped you. - Stop me from what?

470
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:06,080
Stop me from what? Catherine laughs nervously.

471
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,800
- I thought I couldn't hold you anymore.

472
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,600
- You're scaring me.

473
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,080
Sobs

474
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:22,360
...

475
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,480
(In the distance) - Catherine!

476
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,600
Catherine ! Catherine !

477
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,880
Alarm

478
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,200
(- What happened ?)

479
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:49,200
...

480
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,800
- You passed out.

481
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,040
You convulsed.

482
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,640
(- Ca a marchÃ©.)

483
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,120
(Ca a marchÃ©.) (Ca a marchÃ©.)

484
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:09,440
...

485
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,120
- I should call a doctor.

486
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,360
- I'm fine.

487
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,720
- Go on, tell me.

488
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,240
- I was thrown into another place.

489
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,280
I had seen it before, but...

490
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:28,760
I looked at notes, formulas, equations.

491
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,680
- What kind of formulas?

492
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,520
- Dies...

493
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:37,200
of the gravitational force of the wave function.

494
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,840
Sophia was there.

495
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,200
This time it was not as usual.

496
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,920
- That's to say ?

497
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:51,440
- I was aware of what had happened.

498
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,640
I knew Sophia was dead.

499
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,440
- How it is possible ? - I do not know.

500
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,280
It would be like...

501
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:03,840
a sort of augmented quantum entanglement.

502
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,120
Our minds would agree

503
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,120
in multiple dimensions and worlds.

504
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,960
- All of this is unbelievable.

505
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,480
Please drink some more.

506
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:20,200
- I was able to hug her.

507
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,680
I was sure I would never see her again.

508
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:30,440
I think that's the world that all these people see.

509
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,280
dark music

510
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:42,360
...

511
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,800
(- Tom ?)

512
00:36:45,640 --> 00:37:17,080
... ...

513
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,720
Sigh

514
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,640
Sigh We knock.

515
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,320
- Oui ?

516
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,000
It will ?

517
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,080
- I can not sleep.

518
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,440
Are you in a bathrobe?

519
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,080
- It's what we put on after the shower, generally.

520
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,320
Do you want to come in? - Yes.

521
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,520
I can't stop thinking about what happened.

522
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,600
- A glass of wine ?

523
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,800
- I've already had a lot to drink this evening.

524
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,800
- OK...

525
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,600
Quoi ?

526
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,960
- Excuse me.

527
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,600
- Are you kidding me?

528
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,440
- It's because of...

529
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,360
You look ridiculous in that bathrobe.

530
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,280
- I can take it off.

531
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,280
- Why not ?

532
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,360
Nah, I'm joking.

533
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,000
It's up to you.

534
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,720
- What would happen next? - What would happen next?

535
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:14,040
- You could kiss me, if you wanted to.

536
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,400
Soft music

537
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:19,280
...

538
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:22,400
- You just lost your sister.

539
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,800
- I understood that I need to be surrounded,

540
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,840
it took me a while to realize that.

541
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:55,400
...

542
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,200
- Health.

543
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,520
- Health.

544
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,720
I'm off to the lab.

545
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,280
- Two minutes

546
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,560
and I'm coming. - No, it's fine.

547
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,800
- So that's it?

548
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,760
Was it just once?

549
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,440
- I hope not.

550
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,680
We meet at the lab.

551
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:43,680
Bird calls

552
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:01,920
The machine starts.

553
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:12,760
Bird calls

554
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,120
- What happened with this man?

555
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,160
who did you live with in Rome?

556
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,760
- I joined the space program.

557
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,680
I was going to leave

558
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:31,280
for months he took it for himself.

559
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,800
- He was right ?

560
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,400
- It's possible.

561
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,880
But I needed to realize it.

562
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:37,840
For me.

563
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:44,640
He gave me the cat.

564
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,520
- Probably to say goodbye to your relationship.

565
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,560
- It's for luck.

566
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,480
Electronic beeps

567
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:58,680
It's abnormal.

568
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:04,600
... ...

569
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:07,200
Gravitational waves increase.

570
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:13,960
...

571
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:27,240
Bird calls

572
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:30,560
Electronic beeps

573
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:37,840
...

574
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:40,240
Bird calls

575
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,040
...

576
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:54,440
Electronic beeps

577
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,720
The wave frequency normalizes.

578
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,720
What happened ?

579
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,240
- I don't know.

580
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:21,120
*- ... starlings fell from the sky in London.

581
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:25,040
Stupor for the residents who saw these birds crashing to the ground

582
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:26,840
for no apparent reason.

583
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:30,160
Several people had superficial injuries

584
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:32,960
after being rammed by starlings.

585
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:35,880
Many videos bear witness to the event.

586
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,280
The Environmental Agency...

587
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:38,320
- Go away !

588
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:39,880
*- ... opened an investigation,

589
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:43,400
but no expert is able to provide an explanation

590
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:47,520
on the reasons that could have caused this strange phenomenon.

591
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:50,640
Tone

592
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:53,640
*- Hello ? - Zoe ? It's Bill.

593
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:57,520
Have you seen pictures of starlings falling from the sky?

594
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,880
- Bill said it was because of them?

595
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:13,680
disturbing music

596
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:30,240
...

597
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,280
- Why it happened here

598
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:34,800
and nowhere else?

599
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:39,200
Some must still be alive.

600
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,560
For wars? - Look.

601
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,160
Building...

602
00:44:43,960 --> 00:45:44,920
... ...

603
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:48,640
music of suspense

604
00:45:48,840 --> 00:46:32,520
... ...

605
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:35,320
serious music

606
00:46:35,520 --> 00:47:07,800
... ...
