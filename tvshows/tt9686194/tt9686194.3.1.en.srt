00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:49,600
The first time it happened,
I was in my kitchen.

4
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,200
Suddenly I am...

5
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,720
I am in the mountain.

6
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,200
There are lots of cars on the road.

7
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:08,040
There are lights all over the sky.

8
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,360
I start running.

9
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,160
I can... feel the cold on my face.

10
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,600
I am very afraid.

11
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,920
Do you think that's true?

12
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,520
What really happened to you?

13
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,160
I know it's true.

14
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,600
It's not just me who sees
things, the others too.

- Follow me.
- Hello.

20
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:34,320
Her hallucinations are more frequent.

21
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,680
And more intense each time.

22
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:40,840
We tried several treatments,
but she didn't react to anything.

23
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,960
Do you think this is the solution?

24
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,200
We should try to understand.

25
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:50,880
If her condition deteriorates, we
will have to place her in another unit.

26
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:54,200
- Why?
- She's a danger.

27
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,960
She would never hurt anyone.

28
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:00,040
The danger she represents for herself.

29
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,520
We did everything to help her.

30
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,600
Where's Leo?

31
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,840
He is dead.

32
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,680
Get out of here!

33
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,200
Did you put up a poster?

34
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,040
It's inspired by Monnet's Poppies.

35
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,560
Are you interested in art?

36
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,480
Tell me what you saw.

37
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,320
I was in London.

38
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:16,080
There was something in the sky...

39
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,360
- What was that?
- I do not know.

40
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:25,320
We lived in a basement,
under an art gallery.

41
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,240
This painting was on display.

42
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,520
I held my baby in my arms.

43
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,640
I can smell her...

44
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,640
Did you go out today?

45
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,360
It reminds me of the hotel near Annecy.

46
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,400
Do you remember?

47
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,720
We spent the holidays
there with mum and dad.

48
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:09,240
Do you think the hotel looks
like a psychiatric hospital?

49
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,200
Nope. No, not the hotel, but...

50
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,628
The park where we
played hide and seek.

51
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,680
Yeah.

52
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,720
I wanted to play.

53
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:22,600
You were on your books,
dad had to bribe you to come.

54
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,800
Not always, you exaggerate.

55
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,200
Sophia.

56
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,120
Why is this happening to me?

57
00:19:37,132 --> 00:19:38,160
I do not know.

58
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,280
I wish I could help you, I don't know.

59
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,280
Once...

60
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:47,280
You know-it-all, this must be frustrating.

61
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,600
I wish you were better.

62
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,440
Hey! Oh!

63
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,800
You never took me in your arms.
