...that the fate of
media giant Waystar Royco

Great insight, Steve.

32
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:55,323
The fiftieth anniversary
of the media giant
has proven to be somewhat...

the hearts, minds, and votes

of corporate investors
and small shareholders.

Uh, group on the table.
Positions are entrenched.

44
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:21,099
So, it's down to
the shareholders to decide.

45
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:23,476
And we'll bring you
the outcome...
All right. Shut up, Steve Cox.

46
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,395
...and all the reaction
as soon as it comes in.

So, what-what bullshit
are you selling me today, Frank?

53
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:42,662
We haven't had a breakthrough,

54
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:45,707
and Logan is definitely willing
to let this go to a vote.

55
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,501
He's not gonna fuck this, is he?

I'm just thinking,
if we need it,

00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:20,528
wake me up to tell me

full fat for them and
corndogs and toenails for us.

87
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,087
I think, at the end of the day,
to settle,

88
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,797
the clause Sandy really wants

89
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:43,968
is that Logan Roy henceforth
sits on a corkscrew and spins.

90
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:45,470
Yeah.
Hard to give that.

96

Uh, too close to call.

97
00:05:57,482 --> 00:06:00,026
Some shareholders
won't vote till they hear
your father, so...

bail once they hear God speak.

99
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:05,114
Uh...
We're gonna lose the company.

100
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,741
We're gonna lose
the fucking company today.

101
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:08,659

If Josh Aaronson

102
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:10,787

Um, so, the news is,

110
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:27,428
is tomorrow we're all
gonna try to look for jobs

111
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:29,013

120
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:48,825
and take a big blacklight to our
semen-stained family scrapbook,

121
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:51,119
maybe he ought to
fit me in, yeah?

122

Okay.
I'm hungry.

Hey, here he is! The Big Beast.

124

Ready to kick ass
with his big ass-kicking boot!

125
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:00,545
So, you heard where we're at?

126
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:04,715
Uh-huh.

127

128
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:08,803
Uh...

129
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:11,389
I guess, delay the vote.

130
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:13,182
Squeeze Sandy
and Stewy's airtime.

131
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,309
Run the long versions
of the speeches.

132
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:17,520
I emailed a list of
assigned shareholders

133
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:19,230
for last-minute persuasion.

134
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:21,357

135
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,733
Good. Good.

136
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:23,860
Okay, yes.

137
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:25,444
And that's it?

138
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:27,989
There's nothing else we can do?

139
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:29,448
What about the Raisin?

140
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:31,742
Well, the White House
is shitting fuel rods

141
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:32,785
at the tone change.

142
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:34,537
PGN is running with
"Memory Gate,"

143
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,455
and they're calling for him
to release tests.

144
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:39,667
And there's a lot of calls
coming in but we're sandbagging.

145
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,086
Good, good, press for something.

146
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,463
A statement.
Rumor of a statement.

147
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:46,841
Anything before the vote
that looks like a win

148
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:49,677
and turns the temperature
of the DOJ down.

149
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:54,223
Great, uh-huh, late in the day,
very late in the day.

150
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,726
But potentially,
all the more useful.

151
00:07:58,769 --> 00:07:59,896

Leave your fucking
lanyard at the door.
Ha, ha.

154
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:05,943
Welcome to the real
annual meeting.

155
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:07,695
What's up, man?
What's up?

156
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:10,364
Shouldn't you be on
a rainbow soapbox somewhere,

157
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:11,741
screaming, "Time's up"?

158
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,951
Right, yeah, well,
without family control,

159
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,203
I can't change things.

160
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:17,079
And that's actually
what I'm about. Change.

161
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,707
Well, you should save it for
Vanity Fair, bro. I'm all good.

162
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:22,710
Whatever. Look.

163
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:24,587
My only agenda today...

164
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,298
right now, is find a deal
that works for both of us.

165
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:29,175
Cool. Okay. Bullshit.

166
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:30,927
I'm your most powerful ally
in the company.

167
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,094
I know...

168
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,054
your financing's
starting to wobble.

169
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:35,264
You don't want
to risk everything

170
00:08:35,347 --> 00:08:37,058
on a dice roll of a vote
any more than we do.

171
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,558
Well, we lose, we walk.

172
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:39,809
We just move
to the next company.

173
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:41,479
Yeah? With a 50 million
hole in your pocket?

174
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:44,190
You want something out of this.
Sandy wants to hurt my dad.

175
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,651
So let's make this happen.
Hmm.

176
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:49,779
I've got an inside track
with my dad right now.

177
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:52,156
He's one hundred percent ready
to take this to a vote.

178
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,324
Fucking...

179
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:54,992
That would be very stupid, Ken.
Stewy, I know

180
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:56,452
you guys have been angling
for a better deal,

181
00:08:56,535 --> 00:08:58,287
and you don't think there's any
risk taking this to the brink,

182
00:08:58,371 --> 00:08:59,914
but I know for a fact
you're not gonna get one.

183
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:01,666
He's a psychopathic narcissist.

184
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:03,251
He thinks he can
take this to the floor,

185
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:05,253
drag back the undecideds
with his...

186
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:07,213
beefy Logan voodoo,
and win outright.

187
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:10,007
And, you know, I don't know.
Who's to say he can't?

188
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:13,636
So, you know, dude, just...

189
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:16,681
come back to the table,
make a deal. It's there.

190
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:18,641
And...

191
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:19,767
you know...

192
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:22,019
at this point,
it's just managing egos.

193
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:23,104
Hmm.

194
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:27,066
Hey, Logan.

195
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,402
It's Stewy Hosseini.

196
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:30,945
Shall I?

197
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:35,157
Hey, Stewy, what's up?

198
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:37,326
Uh-huh.

199
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:40,079
Okay, hold on.

200
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:42,498
They wanna meet.

201
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,292
They have thoughts.

202
00:09:50,589 --> 00:09:52,216
Okay, right, we're on.

203
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:55,344
"They have thoughts"?
What kind of thoughts?

204
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,596
They have ideas for
a deal space for a settlement.

205
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,931
Fucking A!
Yeah.

206
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:00,558
So let's do it.
Okay.

207
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:03,060
Why have they
suddenly decided to settle?

208
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,772
Well, because they know
that it's the smartest move?

209
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,649
Or they've had bad news.

210
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:12,236
What do they know
that we don't know?

211
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,863
Uh, well, let's...

212
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:15,823
let's find out, right?
No.

213
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:18,826
I'm not doing a tap dance.

214
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:22,788
Shiv, Karl, Gerri, Romulus,
go and report back.

215
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:23,873
I think that's smart.

216
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:25,833
But Gerri should be
out front helming,

217
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,001
so should I go?

218
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:29,045
We nail you to the cross,
Frank, all right?

219
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,129
Okay.

220
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:33,382
Yeah, let's...

221
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,551
let Sandy do the soft shoe.

222
00:10:35,634 --> 00:10:37,011
He's wriggling.

223
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:39,305
Let's, uh, screw them out.

224
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:43,851
Okay. I will.
Okay. You got it, Dad.

225
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,399
Sis, hey, listen.

226
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:51,859
I'm gonna throw you a bone

227
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:53,444
because I don't want to remember
your first shareholder meeting

228
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:55,529
as the one where you
lost us the company,

229
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:58,366
so whatever the deal space
you end up in,

230
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:00,451
Sandy's gonna be
too obdurate to say yes.

231
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:01,660
But stay cool.

232
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:03,704
Daughter Sandi's confident
she can get him to settle.

233
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:05,539
Apparently, she knows
how to play her dad.

234
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:07,375
Uh-huh.
Puppet master out!

235
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:10,419
Yeah, thanks, I no longer wish
to receive these calls.

236
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,007
Does Sandy really have syphilis?

237
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,926
What if he has sores
all over his body?

238
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,386
What if his groin's
all eaten away

239
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:20,221
and the top half of him
just falls off?

240
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,431
Syphilis?

241
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:25,226
I think we started that rumor.
I don't know.

242
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:28,104
Late-stage symptom
is dementia, I believe.

243
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:30,064
Yeah, you've been doing some

244
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:32,400
panicky late-night
googling there, Karl?

245
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:38,614
Hey. Thanks for coming.

246
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:40,783
Sandy.

247
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:42,660
Sandi.

248
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:46,038
My father is very excited
to see you all.

249
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:48,958
So, look.

250
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,752
After careful consideration,

251
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:54,463
if we can make a deal here,

252
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,924
we're willing to agree
to a standstill.

253
00:11:57,591 --> 00:11:58,801
So, no takeover.

254
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:02,430
And provided we lead

255
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:04,640
on deal-making options
moving forward,

256
00:12:04,723 --> 00:12:06,475
we'll accede to a continuation

257
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,769
of combined Chairman
and CEO roles.

258
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:10,104
So that's-that's all yours.

259
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:14,275
I think that sounds reasonable.
Uh-huh.

260
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:18,529
And the three board seats?
Including yours?

261
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:20,114
We can do that right now.

262
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:21,907
I have my dad's
authorization to go there.

263
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:23,325
Can we sign off on this?

264
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:25,453
Dad?

265
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:38,299
And he wants our costs covered.

266
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:41,177
Mm-hmm.
And veto right

267
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:45,431
over any Roy family member
ever taking over as CEO.

268
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:48,559
Stewy?

269
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:52,021
That's what the man says.

270
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:55,566
It is a very important
protection for us.

271
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:59,445
I feel like I just have to
put it out there. Say it.

272
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:02,615
Since there's an 85 billion
dollar baby on the table here.

273
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:04,950
How do I know that
he's not your...

274
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:06,785
meat puppet?

275
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:11,415
Oh, I just do what my dad
tells me, like you guys.

276
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:14,210
-Do you mind if we take a beat?
Sure.

277
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:17,922
Yeah, you have tons of time.
Seconds. Whole minutes.

278
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:21,717
I'm just saying,
they've got tons of time.

279
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,302
Stewy...
What the fuck?

280
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:25,846
Well, I mean,
other than the new proposal,

281
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:29,308
it's a very,
very attractive prospect.

282
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:31,393
I'm sorry,
there's nothing to discuss.

283
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,562
It fucks us and is designed
to humiliate Dad!

284
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,272
Right, but it's basically...

285
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:36,690
optics. I mean...

286
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:38,150
I'm not sure
it would even stand up.

287
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:41,862
You could probably work around,
right, if it ever came to it?

288
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:43,948
Um, with all due respect, Gerri,

289
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:45,032
get bent!

290
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:46,909
Look, okay, sure,
it's humiliating.

291
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:49,662
And I'm 99 percent certain
your dad would agree.

292
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:52,331
But given where we're at,
I have to check in with him.

293
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:53,457
I'm sorry.

294
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,252
Is she gonna fuck us?

295
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:57,753
What?

296
00:13:57,836 --> 00:13:58,879
No. I don't know.

297
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:00,756
Why the fuck are you asking me?
I don't know.

298
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:04,218
Right. That's what they want.
Okay.

299
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:13,310
We will meet your costs,
but no veto.

300
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,067
We need the veto.

301
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,819
Is there no alternative
shape here?

302
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:22,903
We're so close.

303
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:25,990
Come on, Sandi.
We-we all want this to work.

304
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:28,576
Go in again.

305
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,373
Okay.

306
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:35,624
I agree, I agree.

307
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:37,459
It's okay.

308
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:44,341
We're gonna go have a think.
But-but...

309
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:47,136
we do agree it--
it would be a shame if...

310
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,680
if you destroy all this
hard work over a detail.

311
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:51,098
Yeah. Right.
Right?

312
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:52,975
Let's let the lawyers
get to work.

313
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:55,477
We have a landing space here.
There you go.

314
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,688
Fucking beanbag.
Here you go, sir.

315
00:14:57,771 --> 00:14:59,106
Oh, that's better.

316
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:00,566
You want a water?

317
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:02,192
Kerry says you need
to stay hydrated.

318
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:04,028
Sure?

319
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:09,783
Hey, Pa!

320
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:12,995
Got a minute?

321
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:15,122
Uh, tight, son.

322
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:16,540
Later.

323
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,292
Look, Dad.

324
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:21,503
I hear that things are shaky
at the White House.

325
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,839
But he'll win again.

326
00:15:23,922 --> 00:15:25,215
Is that what you hear?

327
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:30,095
I wanted to ask you directly

328
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:33,515
for a really significant role
within the firm

329
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:36,352
to burnish my reputation

330
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:37,478
for my future.

331
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:39,146
You were never interested.

332
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:42,608
Well, maybe
I was never encouraged.

333
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:45,778
Uh, I don't do ancient history.

334
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:48,864
I don't wanna get into
ancient history either.

335
00:15:48,947 --> 00:15:50,366
So...

336
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:51,825
Can we...

337
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:53,661
find common ground?

338
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:56,372
I just don't think you have
the track record.

339
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:57,956
Roman's a knucklehead.

340
00:15:58,415 --> 00:15:59,625
Shiv's a fake.

341
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:02,086
Kenny is screwy!

342
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:04,338
Why can't I get a shot?
Like what?

343
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:06,465
Europe. Nothing vital.

344
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:08,008
Like...

345
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:09,551
cable.

346
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,639
Where's the john?
Yeah, so,

347
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:15,557
unfortunately, the nearest one
is out of order,

348
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:18,560
you'll have to go down the hall,
up the stairs and on your right.

349
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:21,230
Oh, fucking lucky
I'm wearing my sneakers, huh?

350
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:22,856
Good one.

351
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:29,822
Yeah?

352
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:31,532
Sorry about--
About what?

353
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:34,243
Trying to fuck me over
to consolidate your position?

354
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:35,994
No.

355
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:39,540
It just seemed
to make business sense.

356
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:41,375
Throwing me overboard to drown?

357
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:44,044
You picked your prince, Gerri.

358
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:46,213
Don't fuck it up now.
They're gonna marinate
on it, but...

359
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:49,007
Yeah, I think I-we did it.

360
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:51,593
So, yeah, fingers crossed.

361
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,011
Okay, see you soon.

362
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:57,641
Oh, you don't mind me
relaying the news, do you?

363
00:16:58,183 --> 00:16:59,184
No, not at all.

364
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:01,562
He's my dad. So...

365
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:03,814
Yeah.

366
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:07,859
Stewy! I'm feeling it.
Feeling those good vibrations.

367
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:09,903
Let me know
where your head's at, yeah?

368
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:11,655
Let's get this done
and trip the light fantastic.

369
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:13,031
Hello!
Hi!

370
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:16,242
Hey, yeah, I was wondering
if you were gonna be over here.

371
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:18,078
Yeah, I'm over here,

372
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:19,496
just doing my job.
There he is!

373
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:20,955
McGregor!

374
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:22,540
Big day, big dog!

375
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,669
Yeah. So, uh, hey, man.
I just...

376
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:28,714
I just wanted to say, you know,

377
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:31,049
I-I-I'm probably-Uh...

378
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:33,385
I'm sure that you're
probably pretty upset

379
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:35,637
over me going to Waystar,
and-and...

380
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,931
their Joint Defenses.
No, it's fine.

381
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:39,433
I-I had no choice, really.

382
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:41,602
In terms of--
Yeah. I get it. I get it.

383
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:45,355
Okay.

384
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:49,234
Wow, uh, that's a huge relief,
'cause...

385
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:52,070
I've been summoned to see
my gramps today

386
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:53,280
and I just feel like

387
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:55,032
I don't want to be getting it
in both ends because--

388
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:56,950
But look,
I may have to burn you.

389
00:17:57,534 --> 00:17:59,119
You-Uh, sorry, what?

390
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:01,747
Yeah.

391
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:03,499
It is what it is.

392
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,459
I wanted to get you up here
and give you fair warning

393
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:06,585
as a pal.

394
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:08,253
That okay?

395
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:11,131
What? Getting burned?

396
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:12,424
Yeah, getting burned.

397
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:14,134
Is it okay-Uh...

398
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:17,054
It doesn't sound great.

399
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,473
Yeah, so...

400
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:22,184
here's the thing.
My dad lands a deal today,

401
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:24,102
it strengthens his position.

402
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:27,064
Lisa says the DOJ is
non-committal about the case.

403
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:29,107
So, I need to
throw them red meat.

404
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:30,359
The thought is I give them you.

405
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:31,735
It's not much,
but it's a morsel.

406
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:34,196
Plus, it likely gives them Tom,
maybe Bill,

407
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,365
you know, it--
it builds the pressure,

408
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:38,325
and then maybe
someone flips on Dad.

409
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:40,494
You see?

410
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:44,498
Dude.

411
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:46,333
It's not my preferred choice.

412
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,877
Or mine! I, uh--
I thought, you know,

413
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,003
you said you'd never burn me.

414
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,672
I said
I'd try not to burn you.

415
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:53,215
Well, no, you said...

416
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:54,633
On the plane, you said--
Hey! Hey!

417
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:55,884
Let's not
"He said, she said" this.

418
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,094
A lot of shit gets said.

419
00:18:58,762 --> 00:18:59,805
Look.

420
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:02,015
I'm still not saying
I will burn you.

421
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:04,268
All I'm saying is
I might burn you.

422
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:05,519
It's a margin call.

423
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:08,480
And just how bad
will the burning be?

424
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:11,191
I mean, even as I ask that
I can tell it's not gonna be...

425
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:16,947
You'll probably be fine.

426
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,033
They don't want to send
bottom feeders to prison.

427
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:21,869
They'll probably just
fuck you and chuck you

428
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:23,287
to get to the red meat.

429
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,163
Uh-huh. Great.

430
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:28,166
Or you drop
from the Joint Defense.

431
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:33,380
Hey, Ken.

432
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:36,967
Uh, I have to monitor
the meeting,

433
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,510
but I wanted to
give you a heads up.

434
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:40,262
I like you, Greg.

435
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:42,306
I really like you.

436
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,898
Oh, fuck!
Um...

437
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:53,275
it's up there.
Turn this shit up. All right.

438
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:54,610
See ya.

439
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:00,782
Hey! Hey, hey!

440
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,201
Hey, Gramps!

441
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:03,493
How're you doing?

442
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:08,582
A little late, but we got
an interesting day ahead.

443
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:10,584
Don't try to
sweet-talk me, kiddo.

444
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:14,004
Okay. Just a few--
few words of greeting,

445
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,923
but, uh...

446
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,134
And, hey, Mr. Pugh.
How are you?

447
00:20:19,217 --> 00:20:22,512
I'm not an uncomplicated man,
Greg. I know that.

448
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:26,308
Nevertheless, I have tried
as much as I'm able

449
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:28,143
to show you love and compassion.

450
00:20:28,226 --> 00:20:29,478
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Are you kidding?

451
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:32,022
You're the best
darn gramper out.

452
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:34,858
Um, and I wanted, therefore,
to ask you--

453
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:36,276
You asked me for help.

454
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,654
And I took
that request seriously.

455
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:44,117
And now I hear that you've
dispensed with Roger's services,

456
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:47,454
presumably to throw your lot in
with my brother

457
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:50,415
and his gang of
crapulous shills,

458
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:52,709
without even so much
as a telephone call?

459
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,378
Right.

460
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:55,671
I was actually wondering

461
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:58,632
if I shouldn't maybe take
another turn around the block

462
00:20:58,715 --> 00:20:59,675
with old Mr. Pugh here--

463
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:02,803
I have known
Roger Pugh for 55 years.

464
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:06,181
You don't take him
for a fucking ride anywhere.

465
00:21:07,265 --> 00:21:08,558
He's a friend of mine!

466
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:09,935
I-I mean-I...

467
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:15,983
Okay, I guess, the other route

468
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:19,444
is to see
if there's any way that...

469
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:22,406
you might see your way clear

470
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:25,742
to providing a little
financial support to help me

471
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:28,078
retain my neutrality amongst...
Roger?

472
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:31,123
I'm helping your
grandfather transfer

473
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:33,291
the entirety of his estate

474
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:36,211
to charitable endeavors.

475
00:21:36,294 --> 00:21:38,046
What? Uh, what?

476
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,298
I'm giving all my money
to Greenpeace, Greg.

477
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:42,259
Um...

478
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:44,344
What-Even my part?

479
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:45,637
That was the first part.

480
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:48,598
Why? Why?

481
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:51,977
Why is that the first part?
I mean, how do you...

482
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,478
How can you tell?

483
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:54,646
I mean...

484
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:57,482
Why?
Because, Greg...

485
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:01,319
your life is not a bagatelle.

486
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:03,530
Because you're putting yourself

487
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:05,991
in the service
of a monstrous endeavor.

488
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:08,076
Because...

489
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:17,502
Because you need to
take yourself seriously, kid.

490
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,966
Now, we should go in.

491
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:27,429
Okay, so just whip through it.

492
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:29,222
Keep any dissent to a minimum.

493
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:31,558
As soon as the deal's agreed,
we'll let you know

494
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:34,186
and then you can announce that
the vote has been called off.

495
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:35,437
Oh...

496
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,522
Ger's sent her opening remarks,
so we got your back, okay?

497
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:39,524
Yeah.
Good. Go get 'em.

498
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:47,365
Hi, uh...

499
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:49,576
I'm Frank Vernon, Vice Chairman.

500
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:55,082
Welcome to Waystar Royco's 46th
Annual Shareholders' Meeting.

501
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:57,793
All hail the conquering heroes!

502
00:22:57,876 --> 00:23:00,128
Hey!

503
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:01,963
It's not a--

504
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:04,549
It's not done deal, yet,
Con, you know.

505
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,760
But we're close.

506
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:09,304
I think the lawyers can
finesse the rest, yeah?

507
00:23:09,387 --> 00:23:10,347
Yes.

508
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:12,557
Dad, you would've
fucking loved it.

509
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:13,809
Sandi is barely alive.

510
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:16,311
You could've told him to go
fucking eat his own diaper

511
00:23:16,394 --> 00:23:17,479
and his only response would be,

512
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:19,898
Fucking...

513
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:21,983
Wait, what? You did it?
You're on? We're on?

514
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:25,195
Well we might--
Hmm, yeah. They've got nowhere
else to maneuver, so.

515
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:27,656
Well, they could've
said yes in Greece.

516
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:30,492
Yeah.
Saved us all the ball-ache.

517
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:32,786
Still,
Logan, this is good news.

518
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:33,954
Oh, yeah.

519
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:37,749
Good for them and bad for us.

520
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:40,335
Dad, how can it be
bad for us?

521
00:23:40,418 --> 00:23:41,962
They were
always gonna settle.

522
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:45,841
Uh, something screwy going on.

523
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:47,968
Do we give them a taste
of their own medicine?

524
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:50,679
Let everyone know

525
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:52,556
that they bent for me?
Uh...

526
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:55,851
Reopen the negotiation, Dad?

527
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:58,520
No, we settle now
or we go to the vote and lose.

528
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:02,274
Tell him he can't step foot
inside the building!

529
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:05,777
Look, Logan, I know painful
this is but we need this.

530
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:07,028
Christ, Dad!
You just said

531
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,697
it's not far off
what we originally offered.

532
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:11,783
We fuck this deal

533
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:13,660
and there are no more deals.

534
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:22,043
Uh-huh? Okay.

535
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:26,047
Great.

536
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:28,717
Okay, thanks, Dad.
That's-It's smart.

537
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:30,510
It is.

538
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:33,430
Well done.
Well done.

539
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:35,015
Thanks.
Well... done.

540
00:24:35,098 --> 00:24:36,141
Pills.

541
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:38,643
Sorry, sir. Advil?

542
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:40,020
What do you think?

543
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:41,980
Sir?

544
00:24:42,939 --> 00:24:43,940
About the deal?

545
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:46,943
Could be good.

546
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:50,697
Get Advil?

547
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:52,949
I'll get some Advil.

548
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:55,410
I would also like to
invite to the stage, Richard...

549
00:24:55,493 --> 00:24:56,703
Fucking Frank.

550
00:24:57,871 --> 00:24:59,080
It's humiliating.

551
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:02,042
All these years,
he still has to play

552
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:04,169
maitre'd at
the Bistro of Bullshit.

553
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:09,591
Yeah, what?
I'm in the middle.

554
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:13,345
Mr. Roy,
I'm sorry to bother you
but the rabbit is sick.

555
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:15,430
What do you mean?

556
00:25:15,513 --> 00:25:17,265
The rabbit's sick?

557
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,476
What-what-what kind of sick?

558
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:22,103
How-Did you call a vet?

559
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:24,814
How-How much bagel
did you give her?

560
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:26,858
Not that much,
but I-I did say

561
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:29,069
that they're not supposed to
have bagels.

562
00:25:29,152 --> 00:25:32,030
Okay, you know what,
just figure it out, okay?

563
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:33,573
Just call our doctor.

564
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:36,368
But the doctor
does, uh, people?

565
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:38,328
Yeah, if he can do people,
he can do rabbits.

566
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:41,373
Gerri!
No!

567
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:43,124
Hi, by the way.

568
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,918
Um, is this
business or friendly?

569
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:46,628
Oh, sorry. I was just--
Hey, Karolina.

570
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:48,463
How are you?
How's the release coming?

571
00:25:48,546 --> 00:25:49,631
Wait, almost.

572
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:51,174
And who's, uh, gonna announce?

573
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:52,676
I'll do it.
I can do it.

574
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:53,969
Oh, well...

575
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:56,304
It's Sandi.

576
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:57,681
What?
Which one?

577
00:25:58,556 --> 00:26:00,183
The one who can talk.

578
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:02,352
Yeah?

579
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:04,479
Hey, Sandi.

580
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:06,940
Uh...

581
00:26:07,023 --> 00:26:08,275
are you sure about that?

582
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:10,026
Well, go on.

583
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:11,820
All right, but...

584
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:13,697
Seriously?

585
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:16,157
Okay.

586
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:19,119
So, they have one more proviso.

587
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:21,496
They want to take away
the private jets.

588
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:23,039
The PJs? No.

589
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:24,374
"Elitist and out of touch."

590
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:25,542
Well, duh, but no.

591
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:27,252
That's just--
They're trying to humiliate him.

592
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:30,672
Well, was it real, or are they
just basting the turkey?

593
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:32,382
I-Let's just eat it, Dad.

594
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:33,842
You can tell them
to fuck off later.

595
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:38,513
Yeah, we can just offer to cut
personal use or a mileage cap.

596
00:26:38,596 --> 00:26:42,642
Bullshit! No! First, they came
for the PJs and I said nothing.

597
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:45,520
Then they come for the outsized
compensation payments, you know?

598
00:26:45,603 --> 00:26:47,314
This is-No, this is bullshit.
They'll back down.

599
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:48,982
They're not gonna
blow it up over this.

600
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:50,358
Right?

601
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:51,693
Dad?

602
00:26:52,652 --> 00:26:53,737
Hmm.

603
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,822
I need a piss.
Oh.

604
00:26:55,905 --> 00:26:58,992
Shiv.
Uh, sure. Do you need some...

605
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:01,536
help or-I can call--
reach out to...

606
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:03,288
You.

607
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:04,831
Let's go.

608
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:05,874
Stay.

609
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:08,376
You-You wanna
make a decision now?

610
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,461
Before or...?

611
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:15,383
Uh, ooh, Dad?

612
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:18,762
Dad?

613
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:20,180
Karl!
What?

614
00:27:20,263 --> 00:27:21,639
Frank's about to introduce you.

615
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:24,142
I-I-What do I say?
Uh, boss--

616
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:26,061
Wha-What do--

617
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:28,313
Okay, uh, what--

618
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:30,106
Well, Stewy's not picking up.
Uh...

619
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:32,025
Karl, vamp!

620
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:35,403
Great. Karl vamping.
You got it, man!

621
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:44,871
So, without further ado,

622
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:47,665
and with interesting things
to tell you, I believe,

623
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:51,044
please welcome
our Chief Financial Officer,

624
00:27:51,127 --> 00:27:52,253
Karl Muller.

625
00:27:57,550 --> 00:28:00,387
Slow it down.
The deal may be off.

626
00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:04,516
Um, I-I'm needed elsewhere.

627
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:05,809
So, uh...

628
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:06,935
...vamp!

629
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:08,353
Bonne chance, Franco.

630
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:10,438
Excellent!

631
00:28:11,147 --> 00:28:12,148
Wonderful news.

632
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:15,485
Well, uh, in fact,
we will be hearing

633
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:19,364
from our Chief Financial Officer
a little later, and before that,

634
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:22,617
uh... a little further ado.

635
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,577
In fact, uh, much ado.

636
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:28,206
Much ado about, uh, something.

637
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:32,460
Logan!

638
00:28:33,711 --> 00:28:35,547
Logan, we can't wait any longer.

639
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:37,382
What do we say?
Yeah. What's it gonna be, Dad?

640
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:39,634
We need an answer.
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

641
00:28:39,717 --> 00:28:41,428
What do you think, Logan?
Yes or no?

642
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:47,517
Fuck 'em.

643
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:50,937
Um...

644
00:28:51,729 --> 00:28:52,689
I, uh...

645
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:54,441
Fuck 'em!

646
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:57,402
Uh, you sure, Dad? That--

647
00:28:57,485 --> 00:28:58,862
You sure you wanna do this?

648
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:03,950
I...

649
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:07,454
You okay, Dad?
Do you know something, or...

650
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:10,498
I mean, that is--
this is a huge call.

651
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:11,666
Are we happy?

652
00:29:11,749 --> 00:29:13,042
Pills!

653
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:17,130
I just gave you some, sir.
You need something else?

654
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:18,631
Tylenol?

655
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:21,009
Is he okay? I mean,
does this make sense?
Is he-Is he okay?

656
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:22,594
Yes, it makes sense.
He's fucking okay.

657
00:29:22,677 --> 00:29:24,804
Look, he's gambling the company
'cause he's a fucking badass.

658
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:26,598
He knows what he's doing.
Um, was that a--

659
00:29:26,681 --> 00:29:29,058
that was a--
that was a clear no, right?

660
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:31,686
He definitely said fucking no.
No deal.

661
00:29:31,769 --> 00:29:34,647
Did he?
That was a definite no.

662
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:36,649
Yeah, I mean, if we win

663
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:38,276
without a deal
then it's all upside.

664
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:40,487
We're really
rolling the dice here?

665
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:41,779
This is classic fucking Dad.

666
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:44,365
I mean, if we do come through,
it's one for the memoirs.

667
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:45,909
I mean, it really is
quite thrilling.

668
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:48,411
It's a huge fucking gamble!
For what?

669
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:50,788
He's trusted his gut before.
It's always worked out.

670
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:53,041
Oh, God,
I wish I knew the thinking.

671
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:55,877
But, yeah, I mean,
he has been here before, so...

672
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,421
He did, uh, get a call
on the way to the restroom.

673
00:29:58,505 --> 00:29:59,964
Oh! You could've
fucking mentioned.

674
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:01,257
Okay, so, maybe
he knows something.

675
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:03,718
Well, he always knows something.
He's fucking Dad.

676
00:30:03,801 --> 00:30:04,802
He's six moves ahead.

677
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:06,262
Okay, well...

678
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:07,889
So we're really
fucking doing this?

679
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:09,390
Fuck 'em.

680
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:11,226
Okay, fine. Fuck 'em.

681
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:13,019
Fuck 'em.
I'll, uh...

682
00:30:13,102 --> 00:30:16,064
make the fucking call.

683
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:26,491
Siobhan?
Hey, so...

684
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:28,243
No. Either you fold on the jets

685
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:29,744
or we'll take our chances
on the vote.

686
00:30:29,827 --> 00:30:31,996
Nope. He's not gonna
fold on the jets.

687
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,207
So we'll go to the vote.

688
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:35,458
Seriously? Why?

689
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:36,709
Uh, I don't know.

690
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:38,753
I just do what my dad tells me.

691
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:49,556
Greg!

692
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:51,140
Did you say--
Did you say "Greg"?

693
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:52,267
Get this to Frank.

694
00:30:53,851 --> 00:30:56,062
Now. He's on stage.
Get this to Frank now.

695
00:30:56,145 --> 00:30:57,981
Okey-doke.

696
00:30:58,064 --> 00:31:01,150
And after a major
overhaul of company policies,

697
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:06,739
we continue to strive to make
cruises a safe and special place

698
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:10,910
that provides special memories
for all our customers.

699
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:17,125
It adds up to
a bright future all around.

700
00:31:21,337 --> 00:31:23,548
Well, that's, uh...

701
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:25,800
Fuck, that's done.

702
00:31:25,883 --> 00:31:29,137
Good. Decisive.
I mean, if it's done, you know,

703
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,263
if we win, that's good.

704
00:31:30,346 --> 00:31:33,308
What's going on
with the... the...

705
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:35,685
the Raisin?

706
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:41,441
Um, I'm sorry, with--
with the President?

707
00:31:41,524 --> 00:31:42,900
Can we get Ravenhead on the air?

708
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:44,694
You mean now?
Ravenhead--

709
00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:46,613
It's daytime programming.
Call Michelle-Anne.

710
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:50,908
Tell her to get the SEC
to shut this meeting down.

711
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:55,872
Okay, well,
we'll look into that.

712
00:31:58,082 --> 00:31:59,208
I need a piss.

713
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:03,963
Where is he?
Who me? Again? Yeah.

714
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:05,715
Sure, okay.

715
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:10,762
All right.

716
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:12,680
You guys off to the bathroom?
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

717
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,057
All right.
This way.

718
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,351
What fucking business
is it of yours?

719
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:17,852
Oh, no, no. I just--

720
00:32:17,935 --> 00:32:20,521
Just making-Yeah, I think
it's just this back
this way still.

721
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:22,857
Cool. I got it.
Okay. Okay. He's got it.

722
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,108
Yes.

723
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:25,485
We'd like
to take a few moments now

724
00:32:25,568 --> 00:32:27,987
to talk to you about
our TV and movie divisions

725
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:29,989
and our mighty ambitions
for content creation and...

726
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:31,908
Look, I don't know
their thinking, all right?

727
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:33,660
It's-it's-its fucked.

728
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:35,870
Great. You're supposed to be
my inside fucking track.

729
00:32:35,953 --> 00:32:38,748
Uh-huh, well, where did
the plane bullshit come from?

730
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:40,667
Because that's petty.

731
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:43,461
We are a complicated coalition.

732
00:32:43,544 --> 00:32:46,047
And Sandy is
the angriest fucking vegetable.

733
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:48,299
All right, listen.
I can salvage this.

734
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:50,510
I'm on my way to talk to them.
Good luck!

735
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:53,137
The fucking
belligerent zucchini here

736
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:55,765
is set to close
the negotiations for good.

737
00:32:55,848 --> 00:32:58,434
Okay, just--
just hang tight, dude.

738
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:01,020
Puppet master's on it.

739
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:05,525
Logan, you okay?

740
00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:07,443
You need help?

741
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:10,446
Hey, you okay, big man?

742
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:12,865
Are you okay? Did you get it--
Did you get it caught?

743
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:17,328
No. Give me a hand.

744
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:19,455
Okay. Yeah.
Not to-Do you, like--

745
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:22,500
You don't need me to
hold the scepter, do you? No.

746
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:24,585
Okay.

747
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,504
Okay, take your time.

748
00:33:26,587 --> 00:33:27,880
Take your time. No rush.

749
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:29,424
Hey, are you okay?
You're really shivering.

750
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:31,342
I think we need to
get you seen by somebody.

751
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:33,010
I think...

752
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:36,305
Thanks, son.

753
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:37,974
Anytime...

754
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:39,767
Pop.

755
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:41,519
Papa.

756
00:33:42,603 --> 00:33:44,313
Oh, dear.

757
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:51,904
Hey. Oh.

758
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:53,698
Wait. It's Michelle-Anne.

759
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:56,075
Wants to talk to your dad.
Says he's not picking up.

760
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:57,744
What, she's moaning about
the coverage again?

761
00:33:57,827 --> 00:33:59,954
She says it's urgent, I mean...

762
00:34:00,037 --> 00:34:01,414
Well, tell her
we'll call her back.

763
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:03,040
Yeah. Tell her
he'd have the time to talk

764
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:05,126
if we weren't busy
fighting the fucking DOJ.

765
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:06,461
Uh, hi, Michelle-Anne.

766
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:09,464
Hey!
Okay, well, we would
like to. We'll find him.

767
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:11,882
And we will get back to you.
Hey, Shiv. Um...

768
00:34:11,966 --> 00:34:13,885
Shiv, your dad
is totally out of it.

769
00:34:13,967 --> 00:34:15,011
What?

770
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:16,512
Hey, Dad, are you okay?
Hey, Shiv's here.

771
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:18,181
No, no, don't get up, sir.
No, no.

772
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:19,556
Marcia, Marcia...

773
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:20,766
Um, what?

774
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,976
Not now. Not now.

775
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:25,938
I have to rethink my speech.

776
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:27,774
And it'll take me time.

777
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:30,109
So I need time.
Thank you, Marcia!

778
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:32,570
It's okay.
Um... fuck.

779
00:34:32,652 --> 00:34:34,071
Yeah, it's all...
What?

780
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,032
Okay.

781
00:34:36,114 --> 00:34:37,867
Hey, everybody, um...

782
00:34:37,949 --> 00:34:40,995
just to say that Logan
is not really himself right now.

783
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,956
Hey.
Hey, Kerry.

784
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:46,626
Is Dad on any, uh, medication?

785
00:34:46,708 --> 00:34:50,295
Uh, he has a UTI.
Why? Is he all right?

786
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:53,382
Uh, could his meds
make him confused?

787
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:56,803
Uh, shouldn't. That's what
happens if he doesn't take them.

788
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:59,055
Okay, does he have them?
Where are they?

789
00:34:59,138 --> 00:35:02,517
But-I'm not-I left them
with him, but, uh, I'm gonna--

790
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,684
I'm gonna be right there.

791
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:05,853
I have shots,
and I'm calling his doctor.

792
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:07,188
Okay. Uh...

793
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,858
he's got a fucking UTI.

794
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:13,736
What? Seriously? Well, is that--
I mean, no.

795
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,488
It's not that
fucking serious, right?

796
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:17,949
What? At his age,
that can make you crazy.

797
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:19,951
Reagan had one
and nearly nuked Belgium.

798
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:21,160
Fuck, what?

799
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:23,162
How long has he--
How long has he been like this?

800
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:24,831
Was he like this
when he said no?

801
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:26,332
When he risked
the whole company?

802
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:28,084
No one hears about this.

803
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:29,877
Uh, go look after him.

804
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:31,003
Tom... Tom!

805
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:32,713
Go, go, go.
Yeah, yeah.

806
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:34,215
What do we do?
He has a UTI.

807
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:36,676
UTI?
Somebody has to
call a doctor.

808
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:38,010
Can we just give him
some cranberry juice

809
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:39,178
and ask him
about the deal again?

810
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:40,680
He was just asking for Caroline.

811
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:42,181
Oh, fuck! He's piss-mad.

812
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:44,767
No, but you know,
he was in really good shape

813
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:46,561
when he offered me
European cable.

814
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:48,771
When did he say that?
Because he was definitely
out of it when he said that.

815
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:50,690
No, he was cogent at that--

816
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:52,108
I guarantee you, he wasn't.

817
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:53,568
It sounds like
he's been out of it for a while.

818
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:55,278
Okay, no, we don't actually
know that, okay?

819
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:56,696
What about
the phone call he took?

820
00:35:56,779 --> 00:35:58,155
Maybe the decision he made
is the right decision.

821
00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:59,824
We actually don't know
when he went piss-mad.

822
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:01,367
No, that could've been anything.

823
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:03,494
That could've been robocall
or his fucking urologist.
Yeah.

824
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:05,788
No, no, I suspect that he's been
piss-mad for quite a while.

825
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:09,542
Oh, do you?
The fucking Hercule Poirot
of fucking piss over here.

826
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:10,960
Shiv, do you--
Should you overrule him?

827
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:13,087
Go back to Sandy and Stewy and
say we've changed our minds?

828
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:14,505
Yeah, I think you should
totally do that.

829
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:16,007
Dad loves that kind of thing.
Yeah, do it. Overrule him.

830
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:17,341
Yeah, no.
Can't do that. Can't do that.

831
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:20,928
Um, guys, he says he still needs
to make his speech.

832
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:23,389
Uh, what do you think?
Can he do the speech?

833
00:36:23,472 --> 00:36:24,891
Can-Can he--
Can he do the speech?

834
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:27,059
The demented fucking
piss-mad King of England?

835
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:29,812
He could say anything.
He could tell everyone
he's Barbra Streisand. No.

836
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:31,480
I think we have to
drop it, right?

837
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:33,316
But at the very least,
he should be on stage.

838
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:35,192
It would be great
to get the body up there.

839
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:36,986
Okay, we push it
as late as we can,

840
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:39,530
and maybe if we just get him
on stage, that'll be enough?

841
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:41,908
Oh, yeah, sure, maybe send him
up through a trap door

842
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:43,201
surrounded by dry ice.

843
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:44,911
Where is this doctor anyway?

844
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:49,790
He's... He's concerned there is
a dead cat under his chair.

845
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:52,084
Oh, great, okay.
Is there anything
under the chair?

846
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:53,294
No.
Uh, Greg...

847
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:55,004
Oh, okay, great.
Give that to Frank.

848
00:36:55,087 --> 00:36:57,131
He seems
insistent and, uh...

849
00:36:57,214 --> 00:37:00,176
he says that, uh,
he doesn't want Rose to see it.

850
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:02,303
And he wants
Colin to take it out.

851
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:04,680
Fine, have Colin take it out.

852
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:06,933
Okay.
Good! Thanks, Hugo, thank you.

853
00:37:07,683 --> 00:37:08,809
Hey!
Okay!

854
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:10,019
The doctor's on his way.

855
00:37:10,102 --> 00:37:11,896
Why the fuck didn't you
mention this before, huh?

856
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:13,564
Um, he didn't want
anyone to know.

857
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:15,650
Okay, well, that's
worked out well, hasn't it?

858
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:18,361
Oh, fuck!

859
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:20,947
Oh, great! Hey!
Um, who invited you? Thanks.

860
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,782
So, what the fuck is going on?

861
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:24,784
It's fine.
We got it under control.
He's squashing the deal?

862
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:27,244
We got it.
You have to
turn this around right now!

863
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:28,913
Yeah. yeah.
We got this
under control, okay?

864
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:30,248
We're figuring it out.

865
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:32,458
Thank you for your concern.

866
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:36,921
What-What's happening?

867
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:38,965
His doctor's
on the way. Okay?
What the fuck is going on?

868
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:40,132
It's fine, it's all right.

869
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:41,550
What is that?
Can you leave, please?

870
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:44,178
That is an imaginary cat.
Now could you please fuck off?

871
00:37:45,137 --> 00:37:46,389
Listen to me very carefully.

872
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:47,473
Okay.
All of you.

873
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:50,309
This is you throwing it away.

874
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:52,561
You think they're bluffing?
They are not fucking bluffing.

875
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:54,605
And you're putting everything
I have fought and bled for

876
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:56,941
on the fucking edge, and
I am not gonna let that happen.

877
00:37:57,024 --> 00:37:58,109
Do you understand me?
Yes.

878
00:37:58,192 --> 00:37:59,777
You're not welcome here.
You fix it!

879
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,487
You fucking fix it!

880
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:03,489
You may go. You're excused.
You're not welcome.
You have no right to be here.

881
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:06,075
Please leave.
Thank you very much for
your concern. Please, thank you.

882
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:07,118
Go, delusional.

883
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:08,452
Fucking delusional man
leaving the room.

884
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:10,288
And figure out a fucking doctor
or I'm calling mine.

885
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:12,665
Get the fuck out of here.
Thank you so much
for your concern.

886
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:13,833
Like you give a fuck!

887
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:16,252
You probably slipped
him something, Putin. Fuck!

888
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:18,546
Dad.

889
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:24,552
Keep Frank on.
Why is Frank so angry?

890
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:28,097
Oh, uh, that's Kendall.
Is Frank upset?

891
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:30,099
No, some people were
nasty to Frank.

892
00:38:30,182 --> 00:38:31,892
It's fine now, though.
Very mad, people were yelling.

893
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:33,728
Who was nasty to him?
No, no, you sit down.

894
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:35,855
Don't worry, he's okay.
Nobody should be...

895
00:38:35,938 --> 00:38:38,315
I'm the only one who's
allowed to be nasty.

896
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:41,027
No, there were
some silly people
and they've gone now.

897
00:38:41,944 --> 00:38:43,320
Shit.

898
00:38:46,323 --> 00:38:48,576
And we will all
work together as a team

899
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:51,495
to lead the company
to a brighter future.

900
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:04,884
And now I will hand you over to
Gerri Kellman, our interim CEO.

901
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:11,307
You cowardly prick!

902
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:17,021
Thank you, Frank.

903
00:39:20,649 --> 00:39:22,818
I'd like to begin by reflecting

904
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:25,321
on some of the many changes

905
00:39:25,404 --> 00:39:29,617
I have seen
in my 30 years at Waystar.

906
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:32,912
Hey!

907
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:35,915
He's on fluids and hydrating.

908
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:37,249
So it should be pretty quick.

909
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:38,709
He's definitely gonna be okay?

910
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:39,960
But, uh, how quick?

911
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:42,755
Well, he's not
a cup of instant noodles.

912
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:44,131
Sure, but can we speed it up?

913
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:46,884
Like a blood bag
or an adrenaline shot?

914
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:48,135
Geez.
Fucking take it easy.

915
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:50,137
You wanna give him
the fucking Tabasco suppository?

916
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:51,472
Fuck you! It's what he'd want.

917
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:53,432
Fuck you. The main thing is
that we look after him, okay?

918
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:55,059
Yeah, well, obviously
I agree, Roman.

919
00:39:55,142 --> 00:39:56,268
Oh, yeah? Really?

920
00:39:56,352 --> 00:39:57,812
'Cause it sounded like
you want to jumpstart our father

921
00:39:57,895 --> 00:39:59,772
like he's a fucking
pick-up truck.

922
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:04,360
Oh, shit. Um, can you like
call me when he's less...

923
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:05,861
scary?

924
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:07,988
...positive direction.

925
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:10,950
We will explore alternatives
for our cruise division,

926
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:13,452
including a
possible divestiture.

927
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:16,705
And we'll initiate
a share repurchase plan

928
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:19,125
and a special dividend.
And we'll be forming...

929
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:21,377
Doctor says he's gonna be fine,
but I don't know.

930
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:23,504
It's fine, he's asleep.
...spearheaded by

931
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:27,216
our visionary Chief Operating
Officer, Roman Roy.

932
00:40:27,299 --> 00:40:29,927
Hey, yeah, yeah.

933
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:33,889
I was-I was wondering, just,
in your view

934
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:37,476
do you think it's possible
to sue a person,

935
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,687
uh, a grandparent for example,

936
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:41,897
uh, in a way which is like...

937
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:44,692
like in an affectionate way?

938
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:46,986
That might convey, like,

939
00:40:47,069 --> 00:40:49,530
"I love you and, I'm glad you're
a part of my life,

940
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:51,949
but I am taking
legal action against you"?

941
00:40:52,032 --> 00:40:53,951
We're getting-Just--
This isn't--

942
00:40:54,034 --> 00:40:56,495
This isn't turning
any floating votes our way.

943
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:58,747
Should we, uh,
call in a bomb threat?

944
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:01,292
Hey!
Okay.

945
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:03,878
So, his moaning's
getting louder.

946
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:06,046
Okay, but can he
do that on stage?

947
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,674
Is it a wheel on and wave?
Fuck. Like we're not

948
00:41:08,757 --> 00:41:12,052
gonna make the piss-mad bear
dance with fucking cattle prods.

949
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:13,596
We need to be
looking after him, okay?

950
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:15,514
So, he's not
gonna do his speech?

951
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:17,474
Well...
Is-Is he talking?

952
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:20,561
Is that it though? Do we just--
Does, does that-Do we go down?

953
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:22,188
And fucking give up?

954
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:23,522
No.
No.

955
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:25,524
Maya!

956
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:26,901
Talk to me.

957
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:29,028
Uh...
Come on!

958
00:41:29,111 --> 00:41:32,531
I would strongly urge you to do
whatever you can to settle.

959
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:34,700
Okay, I think
we go back to Sandy and Stewy

960
00:41:34,783 --> 00:41:36,285
and try and save the deal.
Yes.

961
00:41:36,368 --> 00:41:38,204
No. No, you can't.
Because Dad said no deal.

962
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:39,914
No, Dad didn't say shit, Rome.
Dad said no deal!

963
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:42,917
No, he didn't! His urethra had
wrested control from his brain!

964
00:41:44,126 --> 00:41:46,045
I at least talk to them, right?

965
00:41:46,128 --> 00:41:47,880
Right.
Yeah.

966
00:41:47,963 --> 00:41:49,965
'Cause if we go to the vote,
we probably...

967
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:51,258
we lose. Karl?

968
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:54,053
Um...

969
00:41:55,804 --> 00:41:56,764
Frank?
Yeah.

970
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:57,932
Tom? Yes?
Yes, yes.

971
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:00,017
I say yeah.
Okay. Rome?
You back this?

972
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:02,311
Um...

973
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:07,524
Go on. Yeah.
Go fuck it up, moron.

974
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:12,404
Hey!

975
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:14,114
Uh, I was wondering
if we could have another chat?

976
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:16,075
Just the two of us,
before the vote closes?

977
00:42:16,992 --> 00:42:18,869
Thank you for your support.

978
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:23,165
This is the power of Waystar.

979
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:27,419
A bright new beginning, but
the journey remains the same.

980
00:42:33,008 --> 00:42:34,677
We at Waystar Royco...

981
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,137
She's dried up.
Just couldn't do it.

982
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:40,307
She hit the video,
but we have to close this vote.

983
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:41,767
This is it.

984
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:44,311
Um, I've got
the White House on the line.

985
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:46,730
Oh, yeah, they've been coming
at us from all sides

986
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:47,856
since the ATN pivot.

987
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:50,276
It's not Michelle-Anne.
It's the President.

988
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:52,945
He wants an urgent conversation.

989
00:42:53,028 --> 00:42:55,197
Oh.
On-on that phone, now?

990
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:58,534
Mm-hm. Yeah, I mean, on mute.
But it's the switchboard.

991
00:42:59,201 --> 00:43:00,286
He wants Logan.

992
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:02,705
Right, well, that's not ideal.

993
00:43:02,788 --> 00:43:05,291
I mean, can we just say no?

994
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:06,792
Well, uh, how do we feel

995
00:43:06,875 --> 00:43:08,919
about saying no
to the President right now?

996
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:11,171
Oh, I would love
to say no to the President.

997
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:12,965
I mean, he can't talk to Dad.

998
00:43:13,048 --> 00:43:14,925
Uh, can we just tell him
to fuck off?

999
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:16,844
I mean, by all accounts,
he won't remember by tomorrow?

1000
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:19,221
Yeah, I was wondering
if it might be about

1001
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:21,640
the DOJ and everything.

1002
00:43:22,599 --> 00:43:25,769
I mean,
it's fucking late, but...

1003
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:30,524
if the pressure got turned down
and we can leak it and, uh,

1004
00:43:30,607 --> 00:43:32,568
and then we throw Gerri
back up on stage

1005
00:43:32,651 --> 00:43:34,278
and just keep her talking--
I can do it.

1006
00:43:34,361 --> 00:43:35,571
I think-No.

1007
00:43:35,654 --> 00:43:37,990
I think, maybe, Shiv. Shiv.
Can we get Shiv back, Frank?

1008
00:43:38,407 --> 00:43:39,325
Uh, Gerri!

1009
00:43:39,408 --> 00:43:40,617
Gerri, hey, Gerri!
We need someone--

1010
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:42,995
Gerri, we need someone
sensible to talk to the, uh...

1011
00:43:43,078 --> 00:43:44,455
President right now...
I can do it.

1012
00:43:44,538 --> 00:43:46,123
...urgently on
an urgent personal matter.

1013
00:43:46,206 --> 00:43:48,667
Roman, you've met him, right?
Well--
well, if it's between--

1014
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:51,462
sorry, Roman and Gerri,
I would definitely--

1015
00:43:51,545 --> 00:43:53,047
I'll talk to him,
the little bitch, here.

1016
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:55,841
Um, should we hurry?
Because I think
it's kind of urgent.

1017
00:43:55,924 --> 00:43:57,968
I mean, I can do it, but...

1018
00:43:58,052 --> 00:44:00,804
Roman, you get on
with them, right?

1019
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:03,766
I mean, if anyone here
is bootleg Logan,

1020
00:44:04,266 --> 00:44:05,309
Roman...

1021
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:08,562
Okay, gimme.

1022
00:44:08,645 --> 00:44:10,814
Just explain it's out of respect
and you can take the message--

1023
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:12,941
Yeah, yeah, I got it. It's just
the President. It's fine.

1024
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:15,527
This guy? Tony Tourette's?
Are you kidding? Are you sure?

1025
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:17,071
Don't swear at him!
Oh, really?

1026
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:19,615
It's not cool to tell
the President to blow me?

1027
00:44:19,698 --> 00:44:22,493
Hey, Mr. President.
This-Sorry.

1028
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:24,411
Yeah, no--

1029
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:25,704
Cross-talk. You go.

1030
00:44:26,955 --> 00:44:30,000
Yeah, no this is, uh, actually,
I'm his son, Roman.

1031
00:44:30,876 --> 00:44:32,252
Yup, that one.

1032
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:34,755
Look, he can't talk
right now, but, uh...

1033
00:44:35,547 --> 00:44:36,590
how you doing?

1034
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:42,012
Yeah, I will certainly
let him know that you are upset.

1035
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:44,640
Hey, I can't leave my dad alone,
so what's going on?

1036
00:44:44,723 --> 00:44:45,933
Uh, look.

1037
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:47,267
Upon further reflection,

1038
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:49,478
we have decided
to accept your counter.

1039
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:52,940
We can eat the jets.
Okay, uh...

1040
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:54,858
Any context?
Uh, no.

1041
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:56,110
We took another look

1042
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:57,903
and thought that this was
the clearest way forward.

1043
00:44:57,986 --> 00:45:00,406
And this is what your dad wants?

1044
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:02,866
Yeah, it is what my dad wants.

1045
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:04,576
Well-well, good. This is good.

1046
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:06,120
Great, so, we're good?

1047
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:08,539
We're, you know,
we're going to be good?

1048
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:11,583
Sure, um...

1049
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:14,962
well, honestly, knowing where
my dad is coming from,

1050
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:17,631
I do just wonder
if there will be one more thing.

1051
00:45:17,714 --> 00:45:19,216
So, don't turn your phone off.

1052
00:45:19,299 --> 00:45:20,384
Okay, come on, look.

1053
00:45:20,467 --> 00:45:23,053
Is there something
that we can work out here?

1054
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:24,388
You know, it's now or never.

1055
00:45:24,471 --> 00:45:25,973
Well, I-I-I don't know.

1056
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,226
Sandi, look, I...

1057
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:32,187
I don't think it's right

1058
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:34,440
how your dad sidelines you
in all this.

1059
00:45:35,774 --> 00:45:38,485
And maybe it's appropriate

1060
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:41,238
for me to have somebody
like-minded on the board.

1061
00:45:43,949 --> 00:45:44,992
So, how about...

1062
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:47,911
a fourth seat...

1063
00:45:49,037 --> 00:45:50,080
on the board...

1064
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:51,582
for you.

1065
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:56,128
You can tell him that
you screwed it out of us

1066
00:45:56,211 --> 00:45:59,715
and my dad was losing his shit
and it nearly killed him.

1067
00:45:59,798 --> 00:46:00,966
Four seats? That's--
Yeah.

1068
00:46:01,049 --> 00:46:02,759
That's a lot of seats.
He will like that.

1069
00:46:02,843 --> 00:46:04,386
Yeah.
Yeah.

1070
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:07,055
Well, it is one more
than three by my count.

1071
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:09,933
So, Waystar, for balance,
will need an extra one.

1072
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:12,603
For me.

1073
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:13,937
I see.

1074
00:46:14,855 --> 00:46:16,356
Uh, yeah, he won't love that.

1075
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,901
Okay, well, look,
just tell him that...

1076
00:46:18,984 --> 00:46:20,611
the fucking,
the markets will never let

1077
00:46:20,694 --> 00:46:22,029
me or my brothers be CEO.

1078
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:23,780
Oh, come on.
Do you believe that?

1079
00:46:26,533 --> 00:46:28,452
I just care
if your dad believes it.

1080
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:32,456
Uh-huh.

1081
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:35,459
Uh, look, I should go.

1082
00:46:35,542 --> 00:46:36,543
See if I can sell it.

1083
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:38,754
But this is,
this is good with Logan?

1084
00:46:38,837 --> 00:46:39,922
I can sell it.

1085
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:41,757
Can you sell it?

1086
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:53,310
Well, I will relay that.

1087
00:46:53,393 --> 00:46:56,605
You are not running again,
and he hopes that we're happy.

1088
00:46:57,272 --> 00:46:59,274
No!
We need the access!

1089
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:01,318
And I mean,
and that's decided already?

1090
00:47:01,401 --> 00:47:02,903
Because, you know, I think that,

1091
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:05,989
uh, whatever our
minor differences,

1092
00:47:06,073 --> 00:47:08,951
we would urge you
to not stand aside.

1093
00:47:10,869 --> 00:47:12,120
Uh-huh.

1094
00:47:12,204 --> 00:47:14,957
Yup, but no. I will be
the messenger boy.
Happy to be that.

1095
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,375
I just think-Yeah.

1096
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:19,753
I just think that our position,
and speaking for my father here,

1097
00:47:19,836 --> 00:47:22,214
um, you know, good friends
can be really tough

1098
00:47:22,297 --> 00:47:25,008
with their constructive
criticisms, but, um...

1099
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:26,176
we would just say, you know,

1100
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:27,594
and I think that you are

1101
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:30,931
a really significant
historical figure

1102
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:32,432
who has a lot more to give.

1103
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:35,060
Yeah, well, the whole family
at ATN could rally round.

1104
00:47:35,143 --> 00:47:38,564
It would be a shame, you know,
sir, to lose you, so...

1105
00:47:38,647 --> 00:47:39,606
Absolutely.

1106
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:42,651
Uh-huh.

1107
00:47:46,863 --> 00:47:50,200
Well, uh, in that case, uh,
Mr. President,

1108
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:52,786
it has been a privilege
to have the opportunity, yeah.

1109
00:47:54,162 --> 00:47:56,748
Best of luck to you, and okay!

1110
00:47:56,832 --> 00:47:58,166
All right, so...

1111
00:47:58,250 --> 00:47:59,668
Uh, yeah. He just wanted to

1112
00:47:59,751 --> 00:48:01,169
let us know that
he's not gonna run again.

1113
00:48:01,253 --> 00:48:02,629
He's pulling out.
Fucking fuck!

1114
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:05,048
Yeah. His minor
neurological issue,

1115
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:07,926
which you know, the media,
starting with us,

1116
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:09,428
have blown way out of proportion

1117
00:48:09,511 --> 00:48:12,639
and he doesn't want to put
his wife and kids and family

1118
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:14,182
through all
the blah, blah, blah.

1119
00:48:14,266 --> 00:48:15,892
And fuck Dad, and fuck me,

1120
00:48:15,976 --> 00:48:18,145
and fuck ATN, and Ravenhead,

1121
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:20,522
and good luck getting the kind
of access that he granted

1122
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:22,107
with whoever
is the next President.

1123
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:24,735
Which, if left up to him,
could be a chicken.

1124
00:48:24,818 --> 00:48:26,361
Fuck!
Yeah.

1125
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:27,571
Shit.

1126
00:48:27,654 --> 00:48:29,948
Boom-shaka-laka! Hell yeah!
Fuck yeah, Connor,

1127
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:31,867
I think we just alienated
our most powerful ally.

1128
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:34,453
I mean, it's kind of
nice to know that we can, like,

1129
00:48:34,536 --> 00:48:37,789
puppet master the whole
American Republic project
and all, but--

1130
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:39,207
Oh! Shiv!

1131
00:48:39,958 --> 00:48:41,001
Shiv!

1132
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:44,921
Four seats.

1133
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:47,007
What?
We eat the PJs.

1134
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:50,093
We get a seat. We get a seat.

1135
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:52,429
Yeah, that was
pretty hard to finesse, but...

1136
00:48:52,512 --> 00:48:54,848
Sandy and Sandi
are definitely...

1137
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:56,642
in, so...

1138
00:48:56,725 --> 00:48:58,935
Gerri, are we good?
Four seats?

1139
00:48:59,019 --> 00:48:59,978
Oh, fuck!

1140
00:49:00,062 --> 00:49:02,189
I would like to say yes to that.

1141
00:49:02,272 --> 00:49:03,649
I just-I--

1142
00:49:03,732 --> 00:49:05,275
I think we need to
say yes to that, Gerri!

1143
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:06,485
Can I just-At some point,

1144
00:49:06,568 --> 00:49:08,737
Dad is gonna
walk out of there, so...

1145
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:10,030
Are we good?

1146
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:11,198
I-We--

1147
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:13,825
Are we good?

1148
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:16,787
Four seats. No PJs.

1149
00:49:19,581 --> 00:49:22,334
Uh, we're good. We're good.
Yeah. No vote. Hold the voting.

1150
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:23,543
♪  ♪

1151
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:24,795
Okay, we're good.
Yes!

1152
00:49:24,878 --> 00:49:26,630
They're good.
It's a yes from this end, so...

1153
00:49:26,713 --> 00:49:28,382
Okay.
We're good!

1154
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:30,676
Okay, they're good
if we're good! It's done.

1155
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:32,219
Great. Great.
Okay, uh...

1156
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:34,513
Boom!
So, um,
we need to talk to the lawyers.

1157
00:49:34,596 --> 00:49:36,556
They need to plug in the new
details and get signatures

1158
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,350
and then we can
talk to the shareholders.

1159
00:49:38,433 --> 00:49:40,894
Right, well, Frank, you've done
so much already,

1160
00:49:40,977 --> 00:49:42,896
I would be happy to.
Oh, I see.

1161
00:49:42,979 --> 00:49:46,233
Okay, so, we will publish
a press release as Karl--

1162
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:48,777
as Karl--
as he's announcing it. Right.

1163
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:50,237
Fucking superhero!

1164
00:49:51,988 --> 00:49:53,532
The world's on fire!

1165
00:49:53,615 --> 00:49:55,826
Thank you! Thanks, honey.

1166
00:49:55,909 --> 00:49:57,452
Hey, you wanna get
a hotel room tonight?

1167
00:49:57,536 --> 00:49:59,246
Hotel? I think there's, uh...
Yeah.

1168
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:03,250
...rooms in the apartment
we've never fully walked into.

1169
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:06,086
I think there's just something
about the way you

1170
00:50:06,169 --> 00:50:08,797
smell and the way your body
looks at this time of the mont--

1171
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,425
You know, I'm like a dog.
What time?

1172
00:50:11,508 --> 00:50:12,884
Time of the?
I think. I think...

1173
00:50:12,968 --> 00:50:15,262
I'm just most horny when you're
the most fertile, you know.

1174
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:16,430
That's how it works, right?

1175
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:17,639
Is this--

1176
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:19,891
Tom, why you asked me
when my period was?

1177
00:50:19,975 --> 00:50:21,435
No!
Are you tracking me?

1178
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:24,146
No, we're like a sorority house.
We're in sync.

1179
00:50:24,229 --> 00:50:26,606
I'm just vibing
to your sexy window.

1180
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:28,024
Uh...

1181
00:50:28,108 --> 00:50:30,360
Tom, are you
keeping a shadow log?

1182
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:31,695
Watching the phases of the moon

1183
00:50:31,778 --> 00:50:33,405
to see when
I'm the most breedable?

1184
00:50:33,488 --> 00:50:36,032
No, I just, like,
counted the days on my iCal.

1185
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:37,242
It's not creepy.
Oh, my God!

1186
00:50:37,325 --> 00:50:39,244
It's not creep--
No, it's not, come on.

1187
00:50:39,327 --> 00:50:40,454
I've got like...

1188
00:50:40,537 --> 00:50:43,248
six more ovulation windows
until all sex is prison sex.

1189
00:50:43,331 --> 00:50:44,624
I said I didn't like the timing.

1190
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:46,460
Well, I think the timing's good.
Like, nine to twelve months

1191
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:48,128
is kind of what
I'm hoping I might serve.

1192
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:49,838
I think it's a good slot.

1193
00:50:49,921 --> 00:50:51,423
What? Put one in
for when you're out?

1194
00:50:51,506 --> 00:50:54,092
No, no! It's--
It would keep you--

1195
00:50:54,176 --> 00:50:56,636
What?
Like, not company, but--

1196
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,680
I might need something, Shiv.

1197
00:50:58,764 --> 00:51:00,432
Okay? Otherwise,
what is the point of all this?

1198
00:51:00,515 --> 00:51:01,641
Where are we heading?

1199
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:03,602
Tom, I don't want to be
your fucking incubator for...

1200
00:51:03,685 --> 00:51:04,895
when you're in prison

1201
00:51:04,978 --> 00:51:07,439
doing chin-ups
and reading Knausgaard.

1202
00:51:07,522 --> 00:51:08,857
You're making it sound horrible.

1203
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:10,692
And it's not horrible.
It's nice.

1204
00:51:10,776 --> 00:51:12,486
Oh my God.
It's supposed to be nice.

1205
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:14,029
Fuck.

1206
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:19,868
Yeah, I should be out there.
You know, I'm hiding back here.

1207
00:51:19,951 --> 00:51:21,578
It makes me look like
I'm losing,

1208
00:51:21,661 --> 00:51:22,954
when actually, I'm winning.

1209
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:24,539
Your very absence--
Plus, Stewy says

1210
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:26,625
we have the deal,
so it's safe.

1211
00:51:26,708 --> 00:51:29,628
Your very absence
has a certain power.

1212
00:51:29,711 --> 00:51:32,380
Uh-huh. I think my absence makes
me look like a little bitch.

1213
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:34,424
We believe this
dynamic action plan

1214
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:37,344
will restore full confidence
in the Waystar brand

1215
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:41,139
for both our consumers
and our employees alike.

1216
00:51:41,223 --> 00:51:44,851
We've addressed systemic issues
that affected us historically.

1217
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:47,896
And we vow to do better
moving forward.

1218
00:51:47,979 --> 00:51:52,484
Because at Waystar, we've
always cared about women--

1219
00:51:52,567 --> 00:51:57,030
Uh, yes, uh, may I just
interrupt for just a moment.

1220
00:51:57,113 --> 00:52:00,659
Uh, we are very,
very pleased to report

1221
00:52:00,742 --> 00:52:03,411
that a settlement
has been reached

1222
00:52:03,495 --> 00:52:06,998
with Maesbury Capital
and Furness Media Groups

1223
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:08,166
which will--

1224
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:12,003
Thank you.
We're all overjoyed.

1225
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:16,800
And Logan, uh, Logan Roy just
desperately wanted to be here

1226
00:52:16,883 --> 00:52:20,887
to address his shareholders
at this very important time.

1227
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:22,889
He's a details guy, my friends.

1228
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:25,267
And he's been working
very hard on this.

1229
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:29,145
And he will be, um, connecting
with his shareholders...

1230
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:30,897
Oh, fuck me!
Oh, my God.

1231
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:33,149
Fucking stop him!
Step on his balls! Stop him!

1232
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:34,609
Don't we have a guy?

1233
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:35,819
Yup. Yup.
Do we have security?

1234
00:52:35,902 --> 00:52:37,863
Sorry, do you mind?

1235
00:52:37,946 --> 00:52:39,614
What? What are you doing?

1236
00:52:39,698 --> 00:52:42,492
I'll take it from here.
No, no, no, no.

1237
00:52:42,576 --> 00:52:44,411
Step aside, please.
Ken, don't do this.

1238
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:46,705
Karl Muller, everyone.

1239
00:52:46,788 --> 00:52:48,665
We can't--
We can't do anything about this.

1240
00:52:48,748 --> 00:52:50,500
Where's Colin?
We can't manhandle him.

1241
00:52:50,584 --> 00:52:52,168
Colin is with...
Can't we?

1242
00:52:52,252 --> 00:52:54,254
Colin's with Pop.
He's with Logan.

1243
00:52:54,337 --> 00:52:56,631
You know, I'm not actually...

1244
00:52:56,715 --> 00:52:58,800
I'm not actually
scheduled to speak today.

1245
00:53:00,218 --> 00:53:01,595
I would like to say this.

1246
00:53:02,721 --> 00:53:04,556
I'd like to ask you all

1247
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:06,349
to please join with me...

1248
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:08,768
in a moment of silence...

1249
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:11,938
for all the victims of crimes
that took place on our watch.

1250
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:18,320
Keira Mason.

1251
00:53:18,403 --> 00:53:20,238
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.

1252
00:53:20,322 --> 00:53:22,449
Cut his mic.
Make sure his mic is cut.
He's so annoying.

1253
00:53:22,532 --> 00:53:24,117
You're not being silent.
The narcissism of

1254
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:26,411
this fucking guy!
You know what?
He looks crazy...

1255
00:53:26,494 --> 00:53:29,331
Yes, now.
...and I think
that can be good for us.

1256
00:53:29,414 --> 00:53:30,957
Iris Versppuci,

1257
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:36,087
Kelly Rob--

1258
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:39,007
Kelly--

1259
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:42,135
Kelly Robinson-Kellis.

1260
00:53:42,218 --> 00:53:43,803
Did-did they cut--
They, yes, okay.

1261
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:46,806
Yeah, but I can still hear.
'Cause he's loud as fuck.

1262
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:49,476
We can still hear him.
Cut all mics, please.

1263
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:51,061
He's not even wearing a tie.

1264
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:57,275
I would just like to announce
that I am launching a foundation

1265
00:53:57,359 --> 00:54:00,946
in the name of victims
who suffered sexual abuse

1266
00:54:01,029 --> 00:54:03,239
in the hands of
my family's company.

1267
00:54:04,032 --> 00:54:05,241
Thank you!

1268
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:33,144
We should've chopped him down.

1269
00:54:34,312 --> 00:54:35,855
Yeah, well.

1270
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:37,983
I guess it might've
seemed suspicious.

1271
00:54:38,066 --> 00:54:40,276
Kind of like shredding
a human document.

1272
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:41,653
Four seats.

1273
00:54:41,736 --> 00:54:42,904
And the Raisin gone.

1274
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:46,408
What if we get
a more aggressive DOJ?

1275
00:54:47,534 --> 00:54:48,702
You feeling better?

1276
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:51,663
So, here I was thinking
about European cable,

1277
00:54:51,746 --> 00:54:54,249
and then boom, open sesame!

1278
00:54:54,332 --> 00:54:55,417
Can you believe it?

1279
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:57,669
It is hard to believe.
Yeah.

1280
00:54:57,752 --> 00:54:59,379
Have a good time.
Thank you.

1281
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:02,173
Yeah, so, I have a little bit
of a development.

1282
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:07,012
Apparently, I can't technically
sue Ewan while he's still alive,

1283
00:55:07,095 --> 00:55:09,889
but I can sue Greenpeace.

1284
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:11,850
You're going to sue Greenpeace?

1285
00:55:13,601 --> 00:55:15,478
I like your style, Greg.

1286
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:17,188
Who do you think you're
gonna go after next?

1287
00:55:17,272 --> 00:55:18,273
Save the Children?

1288
00:55:18,356 --> 00:55:21,234
Sorry, everyone.

1289
00:55:21,776 --> 00:55:23,528
Uh...

1290
00:55:23,611 --> 00:55:27,198
I think, uh,
every attendee of today's

1291
00:55:27,282 --> 00:55:28,908
shareholder meeting can agree

1292
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:31,745
we've heard more than enough
out of me today.

1293
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:35,623
But I just want to say,
well done to all.

1294
00:55:35,707 --> 00:55:38,168
Well done to Logan,
well done to Shiv,

1295
00:55:38,251 --> 00:55:41,087
on one hell of a Hail Mary.

1296
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:43,089
To us!

1297
00:55:45,216 --> 00:55:48,511
So, congratulations.
You did it.

1298
00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:50,388
Uh, I need to see
all the detail.

1299
00:55:50,472 --> 00:55:51,973
Oh, Dad, the detail's good.

1300
00:55:52,057 --> 00:55:53,308
The seat was the only way.

1301
00:55:53,391 --> 00:55:56,603
That's what people on the shitty
end of the deal always say.

1302
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:57,771
Four seats.

1303
00:55:57,854 --> 00:56:00,523
But I stipulated that
we need a seat of our own.

1304
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:03,193
And we've talked
about that, right?

1305
00:56:03,276 --> 00:56:05,111
Adding another person
to the board. Like me?

1306
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:08,114
Or Connor,
you know, or whoever.

1307
00:56:09,407 --> 00:56:11,409
We couldn't
risk a vote!

1308
00:56:12,452 --> 00:56:13,453
You were...

1309
00:56:14,913 --> 00:56:16,247
Dad, you were AWOL.

1310
00:56:17,957 --> 00:56:20,126
What would--
What would you have done, then?

1311
00:56:21,086 --> 00:56:22,378
Not that.

1312
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:23,922
Okay, but what
would you have done?

1313
00:56:24,005 --> 00:56:25,298
I'd have figured it out.

1314
00:56:29,677 --> 00:56:32,388
Time to think on next moves.

1315
00:56:32,472 --> 00:56:36,142
Uh, don't you want to just
savor this moment for a minute?

1316
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:38,812
To, you know,
that we came out of this alive?

1317
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:41,564
There's blood in the water,
the sharks are coming.

1318
00:56:42,524 --> 00:56:44,109
We should hustle on acquisition.

1319
00:56:44,192 --> 00:56:45,610
Just take this
for a toast, yeah?

1320
00:56:45,985 --> 00:56:47,737
Oh, God!

1321
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:52,742
Shiv, I'm trying to talk to
Gerri about something important.

1322
00:56:53,701 --> 00:56:57,413
Stop buzzing in my fucking ear!

1323
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:01,251
Well, someone is feeling better.

1324
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:05,255
Uh, here's to us.

1325
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:08,508
To us.
Uh-huh.

1326
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:13,805
Hey, hey, hey.

1327
00:57:14,430 --> 00:57:16,141
Hey, come here.

1328
00:57:16,224 --> 00:57:18,226
Come on. I'm not gonna...
I'm not gonna hump you.

1329
00:57:18,309 --> 00:57:20,395
Just give you a hug.
It's just a hug.

1330
00:57:21,062 --> 00:57:22,021
Come on.

1331
00:57:23,106 --> 00:57:24,149
Yeah.

1332
00:57:24,232 --> 00:57:26,359
You okay, Pop?

1333
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:28,987
Shiv being a bitch?

1334
00:57:36,452 --> 00:57:38,830
The responses, like, were
kind of positive actually--

1335
00:57:38,913 --> 00:57:40,540
It was good that you
mentioned the foundation.

1336
00:57:40,623 --> 00:57:42,500
Personalized the whole thing.
Yeah. What's the feedback?

1337
00:57:42,584 --> 00:57:46,296
Um, someone called it, uh,
Sermon on the Marriott?

1338
00:57:46,379 --> 00:57:48,089
Ken?
Sermon on the Marriott?

1339
00:57:48,173 --> 00:57:49,549
That's-That's--
Ken!

1340
00:57:49,632 --> 00:57:50,884
Yeah,
I think that'll catch on.
Yeah, that's great!

1341
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:52,886
Hi. I'm sorry.
In a-in a good way?

1342
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:53,970
Hi.
Yeah, what's up?

1343
00:57:54,053 --> 00:57:55,388
You mind sticking around
for a little bit?

1344
00:57:55,471 --> 00:57:56,848
Because I think
your dad wants a word.

1345
00:57:56,931 --> 00:57:58,057
Yeah, what's he got?

1346
00:57:58,141 --> 00:58:00,727
The-the brass knuckles
or the bullwhip?

1347
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:01,811
I have a room.

1348
00:58:01,895 --> 00:58:03,521
Am I grounded, Kerry?

1349
00:58:03,605 --> 00:58:05,732
I have a room. I have-Okay.
Yeah, let's go.

1350
00:58:07,066 --> 00:58:08,067
Let's go.

1351
00:58:26,836 --> 00:58:28,421
Yeah?

1352
00:58:28,504 --> 00:58:30,256
Hey, Ken.

1353
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:31,424
Yeah?

1354
00:58:31,507 --> 00:58:34,427
I just wanted to
tell you that your dad

1355
00:58:34,510 --> 00:58:37,597
actually already left, so...
Oh, he did?

1356
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:39,641
Okay.

1357
00:58:40,516 --> 00:58:42,518
Okay, um, I'll call the car.
