I'm just saying, I wonder
if we should have a plan,

157
00:07:42,684 --> 00:07:44,726
you know, in case Dad does
something rash.

158
00:07:44,809 --> 00:07:46,017
Connor, we're ready for you.

159
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,975
CONNOR: Oh. Okay. Wish me luck.

160
00:07:49,059 --> 00:07:55,309
Hey, Dad. It's me,
Connor Roy, your son.

161
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:59,601
I just want to say that you've
always been my superhero, Dad.

162
00:07:59,684 --> 00:08:02,559
You fight the bad guys
and you always win.

163
00:08:03,809 --> 00:08:05,100
I know we don't get to spend

164
00:08:05,184 --> 00:08:07,768
as much time together one-on-one
as we'd like,

165
00:08:08,559 --> 00:08:10,643
and that makes me sad,

166
00:08:10,726 --> 00:08:13,684
but I'm unbelievably proud
to be your son.

167
00:08:13,768 --> 00:08:16,517
I super love you, Super-Dad.

168

-And you're wearing
the same clothes as yesterday.

175
00:08:32,517 --> 00:08:33,809
Uh... No. I'm not.

176
00:08:33,893 --> 00:08:35,726
We're having a discussion.
There's no plan.

177
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:37,975
I'm just encouraging us
to assess our options.

178
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:40,392
Okay. Is that our business?

179
00:08:40,476 --> 00:08:43,851
The business with our name
on it, is it our business?

180
00:08:43,934 --> 00:08:46,601
I don't know. If--
You know, if Dad's into it...

181
00:08:46,684 --> 00:08:50,768
Like, whatever he thinks
is usually pretty on target.

182
00:08:50,851 --> 00:08:53,309
Okay, well,
I think Rhea is dangerous,

183
00:08:53,392 --> 00:08:54,851
and I think we need to stop her.

184
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:56,975
Well, it-- it's clear you need
to stop her.

185
00:08:57,059 --> 00:08:58,809
What if she sells the company
for parts?

186

Eight weeks ago,

187
00:09:00,309 --> 00:09:02,100
Dad was ready to kick over
the whole sandcastle--

Struck a little deal
on the side instead, Shiv.

190
00:09:06,059 --> 00:09:08,851
All right. You know what?
We need to put feelings
aside and call a family truce,

191
00:09:08,934 --> 00:09:11,768
because we need to fuck her
from 100 different directions

192
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:14,184
at a thousand miles an hour.
I'm serious.

193

Uh... Kendall.

194

Yeah, I mean, I guess...

195
00:09:18,267 --> 00:09:21,142
it would be nice
to keep it in the family.

196

ROMAN: Oh, Ken. Maybe tell
that heartwarming story

197
00:09:25,142 --> 00:09:28,142
about how you tried to kill him
and take over the company.

198

That ought to moisten
the old peepers.

199
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:37,184
So, Connor, I, um--

200
00:09:37,267 --> 00:09:39,476
Do you know
the sand that's in Sands?

201
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:41,851
You mean the nine metric tons
of Gypsum white

202
00:09:41,934 --> 00:09:44,142
they gouged me for 5.29 a bag?

203
00:09:45,059 --> 00:09:46,559
Sure, I know the sand.

204
00:09:46,643 --> 00:09:48,851
So, I was sitting pretty close
to the stage,

205
00:09:48,934 --> 00:09:51,267
and so, I-- I had great seats,

206
00:09:51,351 --> 00:09:54,267
and, um-- and I think there's
something maybe living in it,

207
00:09:54,351 --> 00:09:56,809
like per-- perhaps thriving
in the sand,

208
00:09:56,893 --> 00:09:58,517
uh, like sand mites, maybe?

209
00:09:58,601 --> 00:10:02,351
I know nothing about that and
bear no legal responsibility.

210
00:10:02,434 --> 00:10:04,225
You'll have to talk
to the sand supplier,

211
00:10:04,309 --> 00:10:05,601

seems to have gotten spooked
by a lawsuit,

about to talk.

about this now?

and all the other operations.

00:11:08,809 --> 00:11:11,392
And then he went up the ladder.

236
00:11:11,476 --> 00:11:13,100
He knows about the shadow logs.

237

of "Mo aftermaths."

629
00:29:10,059 --> 00:29:11,975
Why are you trying to fuck me?

630
00:29:13,309 --> 00:29:14,809
Trying to fuck you?
What do you mean?

631

We both know what that was.

632
00:29:20,351 --> 00:29:23,184
If anything, I'm just, uh,

633
00:29:23,267 --> 00:29:29,476
mildly offended on behalf
of my sister and Frank, Gerri.

634
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:32,351
And I wonder about the optics,
but, uh,

635
00:29:32,434 --> 00:29:34,476
hey, my dad knows, so...

636
00:29:35,517 --> 00:29:38,267
-Yeah?
-Even so.

637
00:29:38,351 --> 00:29:40,726
I don't know
how you've done it, frankly.

638
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:44,392
What with everything
you've been through.

639
00:29:45,893 --> 00:29:46,975
Uh-huh.

640
00:29:48,017 --> 00:29:49,392
You're good, though.

641
00:29:49,476 --> 00:29:50,768
(SCOFFS) Right.

642
00:29:50,851 --> 00:29:52,351
-Thank you.
-No.

643
00:29:53,184 --> 00:29:54,601
You're good,

644
00:29:54,684 --> 00:29:57,476
but you're still
in the rock tumbler right now.

645
00:29:57,559 --> 00:29:58,851

I mean, I'm over my shit.

648
00:30:04,934 --> 00:30:06,809
And I've met someone new.

649
00:30:06,893 --> 00:30:09,434
I mean, she is fantastic.

650
00:30:09,517 --> 00:30:11,975
And, uh, so, yeah, I'm--

651
00:30:12,059 --> 00:30:14,684
I'm not in the place
you think I'm in.

652
00:30:14,768 --> 00:30:16,392
No, it's okay.

653
00:30:18,851 --> 00:30:23,601
But when we're out
on the other side of this all...

654
00:30:25,476 --> 00:30:27,517
it's you.

It's always been you.

656
00:30:33,267 --> 00:30:34,643
Well...

657
00:30:34,726 --> 00:30:35,893
thank you.

but thank you.

Um... They're asking if you want
to stay for lunch.

661
00:30:50,392 --> 00:30:51,851
Fuck, no.

662
00:30:51,934 --> 00:30:54,267
I'll be sure to feed that back
to them. "Fuck, no." Got it.

663
00:30:58,434 --> 00:31:01,267
Ah. Look who made it.

664
00:31:01,351 --> 00:31:03,975
Are you going to change
the name of the airport, too?

around the town?

674

all over this place

676

to go into the old house.

at the bandstand.

significantly,

and this might sound dumb,

710

Oh. (INHALES SHARPLY) Yeah.
It's-- (CLEARS THROAT)

930
00:42:16,601 --> 00:42:17,934
Word got around
that I'm over here

931
00:42:18,017 --> 00:42:19,684
and people from the play
are super-pissed.

932
00:42:19,768 --> 00:42:22,100
Oh. Don't worry, don't worry.
We'll figure it out. Yeah?

933
00:42:22,184 --> 00:42:24,559
Okay. (GROANS) Okay.

934
00:42:24,643 --> 00:42:26,851
So, this was actually
a pretty tough situation

935
00:42:26,934 --> 00:42:28,684
with the distribution,

936
00:42:28,768 --> 00:42:31,142
-but my dad did this amazing--
-Has anyone ever told you

937
00:42:31,225 --> 00:42:34,643
that you talk about your dad,
like... a lot?

938
00:42:35,434 --> 00:42:37,893
(CHUCKLES) Okay. Uh...

939
00:42:39,184 --> 00:42:41,184
No, I don't think they have.

940
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:42,559
(CHUCKLES)
I wasn't trying to be nasty,

941
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:44,100
I was just
pointing something out.

942
00:42:45,643 --> 00:42:48,559
No, it's cool, he's--
he's just a major presence

943
00:42:48,643 --> 00:42:50,017
in our lives.

944
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:51,434
Do you want to say hi?

945
00:42:52,476 --> 00:42:54,017
-Okay. Yeah.
-Yeah? Yeah.

946
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:55,726
-I mean, he looks kind of busy.
-Let's go. Yeah, no, no, no.

947
00:42:55,809 --> 00:42:57,142
-I want you to meet my dad.
-JENNIFER: Okay.

948
00:42:57,225 --> 00:42:58,142
He's gonna love you.

949
00:42:58,225 --> 00:42:59,351
I've got a proposition for you.

950
00:42:59,434 --> 00:43:00,517
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

951
00:43:00,601 --> 00:43:02,059
So, we've got this opportunity

952
00:43:02,142 --> 00:43:04,100
for you to become involved
financially in Willa's play,

953
00:43:04,184 --> 00:43:05,601
which I don't know
if you've been hearing,

954
00:43:05,684 --> 00:43:07,100
but the buzz is excellent.

955
00:43:07,184 --> 00:43:08,559
-Hmm. Hmm.
-You know?

956
00:43:08,643 --> 00:43:10,434
So, I'd really like to talk
to you about that,

957
00:43:10,517 --> 00:43:12,726
-if I could. Just, you know...
-Uh...

958
00:43:12,809 --> 00:43:14,851
Hey, Dad. This is Jennifer.

959
00:43:14,934 --> 00:43:16,225
-JENNIFER: Hi. (CHUCKLES)
-Ah.

960
00:43:16,309 --> 00:43:17,392
Pleasure to meet you.

961
00:43:17,476 --> 00:43:19,142
It's nice to meet you, too.

962
00:43:20,643 --> 00:43:22,809
Yeah, and congratulations, too.
This is so awesome.

963
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:26,434
-Thank you.
-JENNIFER: Yeah.

964
00:43:26,517 --> 00:43:29,809
KENDALL: Jennifer's
really amazing, and, uh...

965
00:43:29,893 --> 00:43:31,851
-(CHUCKLES) Thanks.
-LOGAN: Uh-huh.

966
00:43:32,851 --> 00:43:34,559
-She's in theatre.
-Ah.

967
00:43:34,643 --> 00:43:36,225
JENNIFER: Well, not really.

968
00:43:36,309 --> 00:43:39,184
Well... (CHUCKLES)
I mean, you are. You are...

969
00:43:40,267 --> 00:43:41,934
-You are.
-(GIGGLES) Shh.

970
00:43:42,017 --> 00:43:44,017
Anyways, this is so awesome.

971
00:43:44,809 --> 00:43:46,684
Yes, it is.

972
00:43:47,768 --> 00:43:49,975
(CLOCKS TONGUE) I, uh...

973
00:43:50,059 --> 00:43:52,017
I should really mingle, uh...

974
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:54,517
-So good to meet you.
-JENNIFER: Yeah.

975
00:44:03,309 --> 00:44:04,768
Seen Kendall's latest?

976
00:44:04,851 --> 00:44:06,476
Uh... Yeah.

Hey, uh, you wanna...
(INHALES SHARPLY)

00:44:13,809 --> 00:44:15,309
You wanna call a truce
for tonight?

983
00:44:19,225 --> 00:44:20,893
Oh. Thank you.

984
00:44:23,975 --> 00:44:25,059
LOGAN: Nice.

985
00:44:26,059 --> 00:44:28,100
Oh, nice houses.

986
00:44:28,184 --> 00:44:29,893
-Uh-huh. Yeah, these are...
-Lovely.

987
00:44:29,975 --> 00:44:32,975
These are our houses, Dad.

00:44:33,059 --> 00:44:34,684
-They're all ours.
-Really?

Yeah. Malibu.

-Uh-huh.
-You remember...

991
00:44:37,726 --> 00:44:41,434
Huh. Quality work.

992
00:44:43,225 --> 00:44:44,768
Don't like the past
too much, huh?

00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:47,975
I do. I do.

994
00:44:48,059 --> 00:44:52,934
It's, uh... it's just
there's so much of it.

995
00:44:54,184 --> 00:44:56,809
The future is real, but...

996
00:44:57,643 --> 00:44:59,809
the past, well, it's...

997
00:45:00,434 --> 00:45:02,517

-Kinda--

-You fucking get it. You know?
-(SHIV LAUGHS)

1010
00:45:33,975 --> 00:45:36,934
I mean, she told me she drank.

1011
00:45:37,017 --> 00:45:38,601
I shared a whisky with her.

I don't know. I just wanted
to, uh...

(STUTTERS) It may be that
I've reached the end of the road

of-- of like...

What?

1042

My grandpa has made it clear

1043
00:47:00,809 --> 00:47:02,726
that if I want to secure
my future,

1044

then I need to sever my links.
Negotiate a bit of a "Grexit."

Did he now?

00:47:10,601 --> 00:47:13,975
It has been a pleasure, um...

1047
00:47:14,059 --> 00:47:16,809
work-- doing business with you,
and I've learned a lot.

1048
00:47:16,893 --> 00:47:18,643
And I hope that, um...

1049

I hope that I brought something
to the table, too.

I do. I like you.

00:47:33,184 --> 00:47:35,059
He threatened to cut me off.

1055

He won't do that.

1056

He's too much
of a fucking coward.

1057

That's why his whole life
has amounted to nothing.

it's up to you, kiddo. Hmm?

1062
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:06,100
So, I hereby convene the meeting
of the newly formed

1063
00:48:06,184 --> 00:48:08,184
"What the Fuck are We Gonna Do"
committee.

1064
00:48:08,267 --> 00:48:11,225
So we made the second threat
slash offer to Mr. Weissel

1065
00:48:11,309 --> 00:48:13,351
-and he said no.
-To what?

1066
00:48:13,434 --> 00:48:14,684
He said no to everything.

1067
00:48:14,768 --> 00:48:18,267
We offered 20 million dollars.
Didn't flinch.

1068
00:48:18,351 --> 00:48:20,434
No fear of the cost
of legal action.

1069
00:48:20,517 --> 00:48:21,726
Zero appetite to settle.

1070
00:48:21,809 --> 00:48:23,684
We asked for a number.
Any number.

1071
00:48:23,768 --> 00:48:26,559
-Apparently, this is no number.
-SHIV: There's no number?

1072
00:48:26,643 --> 00:48:29,726
And there's obviously something
going on under the water.

1073
00:48:29,809 --> 00:48:31,726
-We think he has a backer?
-Who?

1074
00:48:31,809 --> 00:48:34,100
Could be anyone who has a grudge
against Waystar.

1075
00:48:34,184 --> 00:48:37,684
Get a phone book.
I mean, it's a very long list.

1076
00:48:37,768 --> 00:48:40,517
It's all likely to come out:
the shadow logs,

1077
00:48:40,601 --> 00:48:43,643
-NDA, domino unraveling.
-Oh, mother!

1078
00:48:43,726 --> 00:48:46,184
It's spiraling.
It's moving fast.

1079
00:48:46,267 --> 00:48:49,768
We hear the weasel. The weasel
is negotiating to go on TV

1080
00:48:49,851 --> 00:48:51,517
-and spill his guts. Yeah.
-Oh, fuck.

1081
00:48:51,601 --> 00:48:53,142
-GERRI: Uh-huh.
It's gonna be huge.
-Fuck.

1082
00:48:53,225 --> 00:48:54,975
It's gonna blow wide open.

1083
00:48:55,059 --> 00:48:56,934

1238
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:39,142
You said--
You said "awesome" a lot.

1239
00:56:39,975 --> 00:56:42,601
(CHUCKLES) What?

1240
00:56:42,684 --> 00:56:45,684
(CHUCKLES)
You said "awesome" a lot

1241
00:56:45,768 --> 00:56:48,059
when you were talking to my dad.

1242
00:56:48,142 --> 00:56:52,309
Did I? (CHUCKLES) Okay.
I didn't notice that.

1243
00:56:52,392 --> 00:56:54,434
It's fine. It was just--
It was funny.

1244
00:56:58,684 --> 00:57:00,059
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

1245
00:57:00,142 --> 00:57:02,434
You're freezing. Let me--
Let me get your coat.

1246
00:57:02,517 --> 00:57:04,142
-I'll be right back.
-Okay.

1247

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

1248
00:57:11,851 --> 00:57:14,142
Hey, can we get Jennifer
on the first flight outta here?

1249
00:57:14,225 --> 00:57:16,142
Sure thing. Everything okay?

1250
00:57:16,225 --> 00:57:17,684
Uh... Yeah. Good.

1251
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:20,434
Maybe-- Hey. Hey, Tony.

1252
00:57:20,517 --> 00:57:25,392
Maybe, um... let her know
I might be tied up. Okay.

1253
00:57:28,017 --> 00:57:29,142
Excuse me.

1254
00:57:39,184 --> 00:57:41,684
-Nice night, eh?
-Mm-hm.

1255
00:57:43,309 --> 00:57:44,726
You okay?

1256
00:57:44,809 --> 00:57:49,434
You told me nothing
about you stepping aside. Why?

1257
00:57:49,517 --> 00:57:50,684
I apologize.

1258
00:57:51,517 --> 00:57:53,643
You broke something here.

1259
00:57:53,726 --> 00:57:55,184
I didn't like it...

1260
00:57:56,434 --> 00:57:59,142
when you told me
that I should sell my company.

1261
00:58:01,559 --> 00:58:03,851
You hear what you wanna hear,

1262
00:58:03,934 --> 00:58:07,059
then you punish me for something
I didn't say.

1263
00:58:07,142 --> 00:58:09,601
I may have made
some misjudgments.

1264
00:58:10,893 --> 00:58:12,392
You're careless.

1265
00:58:12,476 --> 00:58:15,851
-You've been careless of me.
-Marcia.

1266
00:58:15,934 --> 00:58:19,559
I'm bored. You are boring me.

1267
00:58:20,975 --> 00:58:23,934
Excuse me, it's time
for the plaque now, Mr. Roy.

1268
00:58:25,517 --> 00:58:26,643
-I'm going.
-LOGAN: Marcia.

1269
00:58:26,726 --> 00:58:28,601
Don't be fucking stupid.
It's a plaque.

1270
00:58:28,684 --> 00:58:32,601
(WHISPERS) Oh, God forbid,
I will miss the plaque. Right?

1271
00:58:32,684 --> 00:58:36,059
Your shiny little gravestone.

1272
00:58:40,309 --> 00:58:42,975
Guess you'll have to face
your reckoning alone.

1273
00:58:44,184 --> 00:58:46,059
Mother would have hated
all this.

1274
00:58:47,142 --> 00:58:48,934
And that trash you call news.

1275
00:58:49,017 --> 00:58:52,225
Now, we last saw her
when you were five...

1276
00:58:52,309 --> 00:58:54,559
and I was four...

1277
00:58:54,643 --> 00:58:56,684
but you know what kind
of journalism

1278
00:58:56,768 --> 00:58:58,184
she would've approved of?

1279
00:58:58,267 --> 00:59:01,768
I know she never would've
approved of what you've become.

1280
00:59:01,851 --> 00:59:05,017
What? Your meal ticket?

1281
00:59:05,100 --> 00:59:07,517
I'm just surprised
you're still standing.

1282
00:59:07,601 --> 00:59:10,225
Any other man would've died
from the shame.

1283
00:59:10,309 --> 00:59:12,142
-Uh-huh.
-It's hard to know

1284
00:59:12,225 --> 00:59:13,768
which is more toxic:

your news outlets
or your cruise division.

1286

All those years blaming yourself
for Rose.

1287
00:59:20,768 --> 00:59:23,684
-I'm not interested.
-That really wasn't your fault.

1288
00:59:25,643 --> 00:59:26,851
This, though...

1289

This is your fault.
