2
00:00:57,883 --> 00:01:00,060
Aw, hell.
I know that ain't my nigga.

3
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:02,714
Hey, what's crackin',
Rollie-Roll?

4
00:01:02,845 --> 00:01:04,499
- What up, doe?
- Ain't shit.

5
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:07,763
Meechie-motherfucking-Meech.

6
00:01:07,893 --> 00:01:10,766
Shit, nigga, how long it's
been, like, two, three years?

7
00:01:10,896 --> 00:01:12,463
Shit, at least.

8
00:01:12,594 --> 00:01:14,596
- Feel good to be home.
- Yeah.

9
00:01:14,726 --> 00:01:17,903
I see the Hole still look
like the Hole.

10
00:01:18,034 --> 00:01:20,254
Nigga, the Hole ain't
changing for nobody.

11
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:22,821
Obviously. I see you
still got that wide body, kid.

12
00:01:22,952 --> 00:01:24,954
Nigga, I been working out.

13
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:43,712
Yo, check out the footwork.

14
00:01:43,842 --> 00:01:45,931
<i>Hey.</i>

15
00:02:11,174 --> 00:02:13,263
Yo, I wasn't expecting
all this.

16
00:02:13,394 --> 00:02:14,743
Shit, nigga, ain't nobody ever
gonna top the shit

17
00:02:14,873 --> 00:02:16,658
you and Tee did,

18
00:02:16,788 --> 00:02:19,356
especially not no Black niggas
from southwest Detroit.

19
00:02:19,487 --> 00:02:20,618
Stop.

20
00:02:20,749 --> 00:02:22,664
Y'all niggas like kings

21
00:02:22,794 --> 00:02:24,056
and rock stars
all rolled up in one.

22
00:02:24,187 --> 00:02:26,233
Hey, now this is love.

23
00:02:26,363 --> 00:02:27,973
- Love for you.
- My nig.

24
00:02:28,104 --> 00:02:29,366
- Welcome home.
- My nig.

25
00:02:37,766 --> 00:02:39,594
<i>Given everything
that's happened, </i>

26
00:02:39,724 --> 00:02:41,770
<i>people always ask
if I have any regrets. </i>

27
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,207
<i>Truth is, I don't.</i>

28
00:02:44,338 --> 00:02:48,385
<i>I mean, we gave up a lot,
a hell of a lot. </i>

29
00:02:48,516 --> 00:02:51,432
<i>Being back across the street
from where we grew up, </i>

30
00:02:51,562 --> 00:02:54,522
<i>made me remember
just how much. </i>

31
00:03:03,531 --> 00:03:06,360
Come on, Nicole,
you gonna make me late, baby.

32
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:09,276
Boy, you gonna let all
the cold air out my ice box?

33
00:03:09,406 --> 00:03:11,626
No, I'm trying to find
something to eat. I'm starving.

34
00:03:11,756 --> 00:03:13,367
<i>Make some cereal
or something. </i>

35
00:03:13,497 --> 00:03:15,847
<i>And have a good day at school.
You too, Meechie. </i>

36
00:03:15,978 --> 00:03:18,328
- Yes, sir.
- First day at work--

37
00:03:18,459 --> 00:03:19,851
I want you to show up on time
and work hard, you hear me?

38
00:03:19,982 --> 00:03:21,940
- Yes, sir. Will do.
- Love y'all.

39
00:03:22,071 --> 00:03:23,203
- Love you, too, man.
- You too.

40
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:27,163
You have a good one, too,
Mr. Flenory.

41
00:03:27,294 --> 00:03:29,687
- Mm, mm!
- Ooh!

42
00:03:29,818 --> 00:03:31,211
I will, especially
after last night.

43
00:03:31,341 --> 00:03:33,169
Oh, boy.

44
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,911
Ugh, can y'all stop
with all of that?

45
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:38,479
Oh, girl, hush.
You got all your stuff.

46
00:03:38,609 --> 00:03:40,568
<i>Your dumb ass
can't light a stove. </i>

47
00:03:40,698 --> 00:03:42,396
Shut up. Five dollars
say you can't either.

48
00:03:42,526 --> 00:03:43,614
Bet.

49
00:03:43,745 --> 00:03:45,399
- Trash.
- Move.

50
00:03:48,315 --> 00:03:51,056
- I told you.
- Shut up.

51
00:03:51,187 --> 00:03:52,232
Dang.

52
00:03:53,537 --> 00:03:55,060
Shit!

53
00:03:55,191 --> 00:03:56,758
I told you about that language.

54
00:03:56,888 --> 00:03:58,325
And, Terry,
why aren't you dressed?

55
00:03:58,455 --> 00:03:59,935
We ain't got no hot water.

56
00:04:00,065 --> 00:04:01,415
I was trying to boil some
to wash up,

57
00:04:01,545 --> 00:04:02,720
but Meech almost blew
the house up.

58
00:04:02,851 --> 00:04:05,332
- Shut up. <i>
- And we out of milk again, too.</i>

59
00:04:05,462 --> 00:04:07,725
Boy, you wasn't born with
no silver spoon in your mouth.

60
00:04:07,856 --> 00:04:09,640
Use the rest of your brother's.

61
00:04:09,771 --> 00:04:11,903
- You bugging, bro.
- It's not funny. It's nasty.

62
00:04:12,034 --> 00:04:13,296
Hey, man, here you go.

63
00:04:22,653 --> 00:04:24,351
- Yeah.

64
00:04:24,481 --> 00:04:25,743
Man, you ain't gonna work
at no Wendy's.

65
00:04:25,874 --> 00:04:27,528
Man, why the hell you care?

66
00:04:27,658 --> 00:04:29,486
Because when Mama and them
throw your dumb ass out,

67
00:04:29,617 --> 00:04:31,488
I'm gonna be the one you call
to throw some food down.

68
00:04:31,619 --> 00:04:33,185
All right.

69
00:04:33,316 --> 00:04:34,926
Look Tee, I'm about to clock
some major dollars

70
00:04:35,057 --> 00:04:37,755
so we can stop sharing milk
and clothes, man.

71
00:04:37,886 --> 00:04:38,930
You're going to the rock house?

72
00:04:39,061 --> 00:04:40,236
Yeah.

73
00:04:40,367 --> 00:04:42,325
- I want to go.
- Hell, no.

74
00:04:42,456 --> 00:04:43,674
Man, I ain't dragging your
Poindexter ass nowhere with me.

75
00:04:43,805 --> 00:04:45,589
Man, move.

76
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,156
- Put your hands on me.
- What's wrong with you, man?

77
00:04:53,467 --> 00:04:55,295
That's my car.

78
00:04:55,425 --> 00:04:57,079
No it ain't, fool.

79
00:04:57,209 --> 00:05:00,517
It's my boss', and one day
I'ma have one just like it.

80
00:05:00,648 --> 00:05:02,302
STO...

81
00:05:02,432 --> 00:05:04,434
See it.
touch it, obtain it.

82
00:05:04,565 --> 00:05:06,131
- Meech, you coming or what?
- Yeah

83
00:05:06,262 --> 00:05:08,351
We both go,
or neither of us goes.

84
00:05:08,482 --> 00:05:10,440
Nah, I can only pay for one.

85
00:05:10,571 --> 00:05:12,312
We'll split it, then,
right, bro?

86
00:05:12,442 --> 00:05:14,966
Nah, bro.

87
00:05:15,097 --> 00:05:16,272
Hey, what up, Pat?

88
00:05:29,154 --> 00:05:30,678
<i>Letting my
brother in the car </i>

89
00:05:30,808 --> 00:05:32,201
<i>with me that day
took us on a journey </i>

90
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,290
<i>beyond our
wildest imaginations. </i>

91
00:05:34,421 --> 00:05:36,379
<i>We built our family as we
chased the American Dream </i>

92
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:38,555
<i>and lived like fucking kings--</i>

93
00:05:38,686 --> 00:05:41,036
<i>partying, traveling,
smashing honeys, </i>

94
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:43,255
<i>eating good,
and rocking fly shit </i>

95
00:05:43,386 --> 00:05:44,996
<i>in the coldest whips and cribs
around the globe. </i>

96
00:05:45,127 --> 00:05:46,563
<i>
I ain't even gonna lie.</i>

97
00:05:46,694 --> 00:05:48,130
<i>If I had to do it
all over again, </i>

98
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:50,611
<i>I wouldn't change
a motherfucking thing. </i>

99
00:07:53,081 --> 00:07:54,822
Why did 12th Street
call this meeting, anyway?

100
00:07:54,952 --> 00:07:56,563
They probably want us
to fall back.

101
00:07:56,693 --> 00:07:57,955
We ain't spend three years
grinding on corners

102
00:07:58,086 --> 00:07:59,304
and shitty-ass spots
for nothing.

103
00:07:59,435 --> 00:08:01,176
Word up.
That corner shit is dead.

104
00:08:01,306 --> 00:08:02,394
Why they choose here, though?

105
00:08:02,525 --> 00:08:04,527
They didn't. I did.

106
00:08:04,658 --> 00:08:06,268
The City Championship's game
is today,

107
00:08:06,398 --> 00:08:08,400
so the place is crawling
with cops and metal detectors,

108
00:08:08,531 --> 00:08:10,490
which means them 12th Street
niggas won't be strapped.

109
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:14,668
- Where are my props?
- Fuck you.

110
00:08:14,798 --> 00:08:16,365
Keep it moving, please.

111
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:19,411
<i>All metal objects
in the trays. Let's go. </i>

112
00:08:19,542 --> 00:08:21,631
<i>That means everything
in the trays. </i>

113
00:08:21,762 --> 00:08:23,851
<i>Empty your pockets.</i>

114
00:08:23,981 --> 00:08:26,810
Man, you think
them factory dudes smoking?

115
00:08:26,941 --> 00:08:29,117
Man, there you go putting
mustard on shit now.

116
00:08:29,247 --> 00:08:31,902
Shit, I'm saying that might be
a market we can tap into.

117
00:08:32,033 --> 00:08:33,251
Man, I'd like to tap

118
00:08:33,382 --> 00:08:35,079
into one of these
goddamn cheerleaders.

119
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:36,428
<i>If they had honeys this fine
when I was in school, </i>

120
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,256
I wouldn't have dropped out.

121
00:08:38,387 --> 00:08:40,128
Yo, I got to holla at my boy.

122
00:08:40,258 --> 00:08:42,130
What up, Los? You got it?

123
00:08:45,655 --> 00:08:48,353
- Yo.
- Game started an hour ago.

124
00:08:48,484 --> 00:08:50,007
I'm here now.
Shut up and come on.

125
00:08:56,057 --> 00:08:59,495
Man, take this C note
for your troubles.

126
00:08:59,626 --> 00:09:01,889
Not gonna use that shit,
are you?

127
00:09:02,019 --> 00:09:03,804
I will if you don't quit
fucking with me.

128
00:09:05,414 --> 00:09:07,503
- Nah. Good looks.
- All right.

129
00:09:07,634 --> 00:09:09,679
I don't know
about this shit, bro.

130
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:11,246
- Shit--

131
00:09:16,164 --> 00:09:17,818
First of all,
fuck the Fifty Boyz.

132
00:09:17,948 --> 00:09:19,646
Y'all ain't from Ecorse.

133
00:09:19,776 --> 00:09:21,909
<i>But you carving out
a space for yourself, okay. </i>

134
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:23,388
<i>I gave you that pass,</i>

135
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:24,868
so why I got to hear about you

136
00:09:24,999 --> 00:09:27,044
setting up shop a pinky toe
from 12th Street?

137
00:09:27,175 --> 00:09:28,916
<i>First of all,
we in the D, motherfucker. </i>

138
00:09:29,046 --> 00:09:30,221
Is this nigga talking

139
00:09:30,352 --> 00:09:31,962
about that area near the
funeral home?

140
00:09:32,093 --> 00:09:33,311
Nigga, that shit was uncharted
territory until we came

141
00:09:33,442 --> 00:09:35,313
and planted our flag.

142
00:09:35,444 --> 00:09:36,619
So now y'all just asking us
to move out?

143
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,665
Nah, Meech.

144
00:09:38,795 --> 00:09:41,450
I'm telling you, if y'all
don't stop, bodies gonna drop.

145
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,583
<i>J-Mo, look, it's
enough money and food out here </i>

146
00:09:43,713 --> 00:09:44,801
<i>for all of us to eat.</i>

147
00:09:44,932 --> 00:09:46,542
Now, if we squash
this dumb shit

148
00:09:46,673 --> 00:09:48,544
and came together and pooled
our resources,

149
00:09:48,675 --> 00:09:50,807
nigga, we'd be like the
motherfucking Italian Mob, man.

150
00:09:50,938 --> 00:09:52,504
This ain't no fucking
negotiation, nigga.

151
00:09:52,635 --> 00:09:54,855
We see y'all little
sandbox boys around here again,

152
00:09:54,985 --> 00:09:56,421
it's gonna be war.

153
00:09:56,552 --> 00:09:58,249
Then let's go then,
motherfucker.

154
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,077
I ain't scared
of y'all bitch-ass niggas.

155
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:01,557
Matter of fact, I ain't moving
nowhere no more. What's up?

156
00:10:01,688 --> 00:10:03,559
Hey, hey, Tee.

157
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:05,169
<i>I suggest you talk
to your big brother over here, </i>

158
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,867
<i>tell him to keep
this shit peaceful, </i>

159
00:10:06,997 --> 00:10:08,433
or you may have to start
walking your old girl home

160
00:10:08,564 --> 00:10:09,826
after her shift from Wendy's.

161
00:10:09,957 --> 00:10:12,481
- Nigga, fuck you, nigga.
- Fuck.

162
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:13,569
Hey, Tee, chill.
Put that shit away.

163
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,005
We don't even need that shit.

164
00:10:15,136 --> 00:10:16,311
These niggas ain't
worth that shit, man.

165
00:10:16,441 --> 00:10:18,008
This nigga got him
a little pow-pow.

166
00:10:18,139 --> 00:10:19,967
<i>You know what to do with that?</i>

167
00:10:20,097 --> 00:10:21,969
You ever shoot
somebody before, Tee?

168
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:25,581
<i>You know what?</i>

169
00:10:25,712 --> 00:10:27,017
<i>As a show of good faith</i>

170
00:10:27,148 --> 00:10:28,715
and because
my super-passionate brother

171
00:10:28,845 --> 00:10:30,760
just had to pull his gat,
I'ma give y'all niggas

172
00:10:30,891 --> 00:10:32,675
that fucking area, man.

173
00:10:32,806 --> 00:10:34,416
- Meech, what the fuck?

174
00:10:34,546 --> 00:10:36,723
And as a token
of my appreciation,

175
00:10:36,853 --> 00:10:38,507
I'm gonna look past
all this dumb shit.

176
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,378
<i>But don't let this type
of shit happen again, man, </i>

177
00:10:40,509 --> 00:10:42,990
or that genie ain't goin'
back in that bottle.

178
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,861
- 12th Street.
- Fifty Boyz, motherfucker.

179
00:10:47,298 --> 00:10:49,039
Y'all get y'all little asses
out of here

180
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:50,693
<i>before we got to hang y'all</i>

181
00:10:50,824 --> 00:10:52,956
by y'all raggedy-ass rat tails,
motherfucker, huh?

182
00:10:53,087 --> 00:10:55,002
Get the fuck on.

183
00:10:55,132 --> 00:10:57,308
Go back to the sandbox,
little niggas.

184
00:10:57,439 --> 00:10:58,396
Fuck with some damn pussy.

185
00:11:00,181 --> 00:11:03,575
Man, we ain't never agree
to bring no fuckin' strap

186
00:11:03,706 --> 00:11:05,229
to no goddamn meeting, Tee.

187
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,709
Why do you think
I scheduled it there, Meech?

188
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,363
It's 'cause I knew
I could sneak it in, bro.

189
00:11:08,493 --> 00:11:10,844
Popping off with guns
ain't even you, Tee.

190
00:11:10,974 --> 00:11:12,889
Nigga, that's my lane.

191
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,804
And you almost fucked up
everything we done worked for.

192
00:11:14,935 --> 00:11:17,720
See, Meech,
your ass always think

193
00:11:17,851 --> 00:11:19,026
you can just talk your way
out of shit.

194
00:11:19,156 --> 00:11:20,723
But I'm trying to win.

195
00:11:20,854 --> 00:11:22,986
Well, you must have forgot
that my mouth

196
00:11:23,117 --> 00:11:24,814
is the reason
we here right now.

197
00:11:24,945 --> 00:11:27,556
And you must have forgot that
your mouth is the reason

198
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,340
why we just
look like some fucking hos.

199
00:11:29,471 --> 00:11:31,473
Man, who cares?

200
00:11:31,603 --> 00:11:34,215
Nigga, as long as we getting
this motherfucking paper

201
00:11:34,345 --> 00:11:36,870
and we staying ahead of they
ass, don't nothing else matter.

202
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,785
You just gave up
where we've been making

203
00:11:38,915 --> 00:11:40,961
over half of our earnings.

204
00:11:41,091 --> 00:11:43,746
Our crew ain't big enough
to go to war yet, Tee.

205
00:11:43,877 --> 00:11:45,879
War means bodies.
Bodies bring cops.

206
00:11:46,009 --> 00:11:48,098
And cops kill business.

207
00:11:48,229 --> 00:11:51,711
Nigga, this ain't
the fucking mobsters, bro.

208
00:11:51,841 --> 00:11:53,364
We're not in a fucking movie.

209
00:11:53,495 --> 00:11:55,410
Yeah. I know that.

210
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,586
<i>No, what I'm trying
to get you to understand is, </i>

211
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:00,023
<i>man, we got a product
that creates its own demand. </i>

212
00:12:00,154 --> 00:12:02,460
As long as we got my vision
and your brains, we're okay.

213
00:12:02,591 --> 00:12:04,201
Nobody fuck with us, man.

214
00:12:04,332 --> 00:12:07,639
But it's like I told you--
the product ain't ours.

215
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:09,467
<i>Getting dope
on consignment from Pat, </i>

216
00:12:09,598 --> 00:12:11,556
means we're rentin' the shit.

217
00:12:11,687 --> 00:12:13,210
We'll never maximize our loop

218
00:12:13,341 --> 00:12:15,604
until we get
our own shit outright.

219
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:18,738
But first, get that
motherfucking gun

220
00:12:18,868 --> 00:12:20,565
- out the house right now...
- There you go again...

221
00:12:20,696 --> 00:12:22,089
- ...before Mama find out!
- ...trying to tell me--

222
00:12:22,219 --> 00:12:23,394
Bro, we not little kid--

223
00:12:23,525 --> 00:12:25,135
Hey.

224
00:12:25,266 --> 00:12:26,571
Hey, Mama.

225
00:12:26,702 --> 00:12:28,791
- Dinner's ready.
- Yes, ma'am.

226
00:12:28,922 --> 00:12:30,358
<i>
Oh, we coming right now.</i>

227
00:12:30,488 --> 00:12:31,620
What we looking like?

228
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,230
You ready?

229
00:12:33,361 --> 00:12:34,754
Wash your hands
before you come downstairs.

230
00:12:34,884 --> 00:12:36,277
Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am.

231
00:12:36,407 --> 00:12:38,758
Yeah, I'm hungry.

232
00:12:38,888 --> 00:12:40,368
Ooh!

233
00:12:46,722 --> 00:12:49,333
Ooh, but, Mama, that smell
like heaven right there.

234
00:12:49,464 --> 00:12:51,248
You're such a kiss-ass.

235
00:12:51,379 --> 00:12:52,684
Hey, you want me to
wash your mouth out with soap,

236
00:12:52,815 --> 00:12:54,164
- young lady?
- That ain't fair.

237
00:12:54,295 --> 00:12:55,383
Meech and Terry
say way worse all the time.

238
00:12:55,513 --> 00:12:57,559
- Snitch.
- Shut up.

239
00:12:57,689 --> 00:12:59,256
Thought you were
bringing my grandbaby by?

240
00:12:59,387 --> 00:13:00,518
Yeah, they went out for dinner
this weekend.

241
00:13:00,649 --> 00:13:01,781
Well, you just make sure

242
00:13:01,911 --> 00:13:03,260
you bring him by
next weekend, okay?

243
00:13:03,391 --> 00:13:04,479
- Give me some of that.
- Oh, shoot.

244
00:13:04,609 --> 00:13:06,698
Okay, here.

245
00:13:08,483 --> 00:13:09,832
- Give me some of that.
- Hey, baby.

246
00:13:12,966 --> 00:13:14,706
Boy, what'd I tell you
about looking proper

247
00:13:14,837 --> 00:13:17,057
at my dinner table?

248
00:13:21,278 --> 00:13:23,846
<i>Clasp hands.
Bow your heads. </i>

249
00:13:23,977 --> 00:13:27,284
- Whose turn is it to say grace?
- I think it's Meechie's.

250
00:13:27,415 --> 00:13:29,678
Terry, say the blessing, boy.

251
00:13:31,636 --> 00:13:33,638
Good food.

252
00:13:33,769 --> 00:13:36,076
Good meat. Good God, let's eat.

253
00:13:36,206 --> 00:13:38,339
Now, you know that ain't
no doggone blessing.

254
00:13:38,469 --> 00:13:39,862
Daddy be saying it
all the time.

255
00:13:39,993 --> 00:13:42,517
Yeah, sound good to me.
Pass the lasagna.

256
00:13:42,647 --> 00:13:43,910
Yeah, Ma, don't forget.

257
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,042
I need money
for that Boblo trip.

258
00:13:46,173 --> 00:13:47,652
We'll talk about it later.

259
00:13:47,783 --> 00:13:49,698
That's what you said last week.

260
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,961
Hey, look, Nicki.
Don't even trip. I got you.

261
00:13:52,092 --> 00:13:53,441
We're not taking your money.

262
00:13:53,571 --> 00:13:55,008
Pops, it's just
for her school field trip.

263
00:13:55,138 --> 00:13:58,011
- Did I stutter?
- Terry, how was school today?

264
00:13:58,141 --> 00:14:00,013
<i>It was good.</i>

265
00:14:00,143 --> 00:14:01,318
<i>You're gonna be on
the honor roll again, right? </i>

266
00:14:01,449 --> 00:14:02,885
Yes, sir.

267
00:14:03,016 --> 00:14:04,408
Make sure last semester
wasn't no fluke?

268
00:14:04,539 --> 00:14:05,670
- <i>Yes, sir.
- Look, I don't care </i>

269
00:14:05,801 --> 00:14:07,411
<i>if you on the honor roll
or not. </i>

270
00:14:07,542 --> 00:14:09,631
I just want you to graduate
so you can get a good job,

271
00:14:09,761 --> 00:14:12,329
<i>and so that you can support
that baby you got on the way. </i>

272
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:14,592
Okay, look, my stomach
getting queasy, all right?

273
00:14:14,723 --> 00:14:16,420
I got to catch some air.

274
00:14:16,551 --> 00:14:18,118
Well, just remember you
on kitchen duty tonight.

275
00:14:18,248 --> 00:14:19,815
All right.

276
00:14:19,946 --> 00:14:20,947
<i>He always playing.</i>

277
00:14:33,307 --> 00:14:34,743
All right,
I want a loose burger,

278
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,832
chili cheese fries,
extra cheese.

279
00:14:36,963 --> 00:14:38,921
Um, I'm sorry.
We changed our menu.

280
00:14:39,052 --> 00:14:40,575
We don't sell
loose burgers anymore.

281
00:14:40,705 --> 00:14:43,447
- Where Duka at?
- I think you mean Daniel.

282
00:14:43,578 --> 00:14:45,580
He moved to our new location
in Lincoln Park,

283
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:47,669
but, uh, I'm Jeremy, and I'll
be happy to take your order.

284
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:50,106
Coneys belong downtown.

285
00:14:50,237 --> 00:14:52,500
Loose burgers is for the hood.

286
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:55,285
Some things
just ain't supposed to change.

287
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:57,722
How about you step to the side
'til you're ready to order?

288
00:14:57,853 --> 00:14:59,115
- I should just step aside?
- Yeah.

289
00:14:59,246 --> 00:15:00,769
All right.

290
00:15:03,554 --> 00:15:05,121
Y'all might want
to head to Mickey D's

291
00:15:05,252 --> 00:15:07,036
for a happy meal or something.

292
00:15:07,167 --> 00:15:08,298
Come on, Amanda.

293
00:15:10,344 --> 00:15:12,520
Please. Please.

294
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:14,217
I just took over a week ago.

295
00:15:14,348 --> 00:15:16,132
- You from Ecorse, Jeremy?
- No.

296
00:15:16,263 --> 00:15:17,612
Just--just--just take
whatever you want.

297
00:15:17,742 --> 00:15:19,222
Here, here.

298
00:15:19,353 --> 00:15:20,528
<i>-Jeremy, no.
- You want some pop?</i>

299
00:15:20,658 --> 00:15:22,660
Listen, Jeremy, look,

300
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:24,445
I'm a changed man, all right?

301
00:15:24,575 --> 00:15:26,403
But I'm gonna
tell you what, though...

302
00:15:26,534 --> 00:15:28,014
...when you see Duka,

303
00:15:28,144 --> 00:15:30,581
you tell him that Lamar Silas
is back in town.

304
00:15:30,712 --> 00:15:33,367
And the next time
I'm back in here,

305
00:15:33,497 --> 00:15:35,630
I expect things to go back
to the way they were.

306
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,849
You understand?

307
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,242
- Yeah?
- Okay. Okay.

308
00:15:39,373 --> 00:15:41,549
All right. That's good.

309
00:15:45,857 --> 00:15:47,468
What up, doe?

310
00:15:47,598 --> 00:15:48,860
Y'all good?

311
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,688
<i>Call the fucking police.</i>

312
00:15:50,819 --> 00:15:52,821
- Be easy.
- <i>Hey, call the cops.</i>

313
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,823
<i>Right now, call the cops.</i>

314
00:15:56,433 --> 00:15:57,739
Yeah, we be easy, man.

315
00:15:59,697 --> 00:16:00,960
Hey, y'all finna see
this motherfucker lose his mind

316
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:02,265
and all his money.

317
00:16:02,396 --> 00:16:04,093
Hey, my money on the table.

318
00:16:04,224 --> 00:16:05,529
Go on and shoot
the motherfucking shot.

319
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,444
Nigga, watch how you talk
to me, motherfucker.

320
00:16:07,575 --> 00:16:08,576
Don't be rushing me.
This is my spot.

321
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,841
- What up, doe?
- Hey, young-un.

322
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:13,973
Hey, what's up?

323
00:16:24,287 --> 00:16:26,159
- Huh?
- Boy, that was illegal.

324
00:16:26,289 --> 00:16:27,812
But that was sweet as hell, OG.

325
00:16:27,943 --> 00:16:29,292
Ain't that the game we in,
young-un?

326
00:16:29,423 --> 00:16:30,728
Always, nigga.

327
00:16:30,859 --> 00:16:32,556
I heard y'all gave up territory

328
00:16:32,687 --> 00:16:34,036
to them 12th Street Boys--
what's up with that?

329
00:16:34,167 --> 00:16:35,429
I mean, wasn't really much
I could do, OG.

330
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:36,952
We was gonna be popping off.

331
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:39,302
Listen, man, this the streets
we talking about.

332
00:16:39,433 --> 00:16:40,912
If somebody stepping
on your toes, motherfucker,

333
00:16:41,043 --> 00:16:42,610
you don't move to the side.

334
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,916
You back their ass up.

335
00:16:45,047 --> 00:16:46,527
That's what I'm saying--
you think I should have

336
00:16:46,657 --> 00:16:49,356
<i>-just fought 'em?
- Yeah, nigga. Yeah. Okay?</i>

337
00:16:49,486 --> 00:16:52,011
And got to be smart about it,
too, so you don't get knocked.

338
00:16:52,141 --> 00:16:53,360
What if there's
another way, OG?

339
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:54,796
The rules always been the same.

340
00:16:54,926 --> 00:16:56,798
Ain't no other way.

341
00:16:56,928 --> 00:16:58,843
You got to handle this, and
you got to handle it fast, too,

342
00:16:58,974 --> 00:17:01,455
'cause Lamar Silas just TD'd.

343
00:17:01,585 --> 00:17:04,414
- Old head? Used to run Ecorse?
- <i>Hell, yeah.</i>

344
00:17:04,545 --> 00:17:06,764
Shit. Everybody in these damn
streets old except for us.

345
00:17:06,895 --> 00:17:09,245
They say he the one
that kidnapped that rapper.

346
00:17:09,376 --> 00:17:11,465
Strung him up next
to a beehive naked.

347
00:17:11,595 --> 00:17:14,772
<i>Let him get all stung up 'til
his broad coughed up the loot. </i>

348
00:17:14,903 --> 00:17:17,645
- Hmm. That's scandalous.
- Wait. Hold on. Hold on.

349
00:17:17,775 --> 00:17:19,081
Y'all making this nigga

350
00:17:19,212 --> 00:17:20,778
sound like
the boogeyman or some shit.

351
00:17:20,909 --> 00:17:24,434
The point is...
the competition thickening.

352
00:17:24,565 --> 00:17:25,914
You got to do whatever it is

353
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,612
that you got to do
to protect your shit,

354
00:17:28,743 --> 00:17:33,008
'cause the vultures
and the wolves coming, nigga.

355
00:17:33,139 --> 00:17:35,402
<i>And one more thing--</i>

356
00:17:35,532 --> 00:17:37,273
you got to come dressed
to kill at my party,

357
00:17:37,404 --> 00:17:38,753
motherfucker, for sure,
ain't that right?

358
00:17:40,624 --> 00:17:42,974
Man, outside of you,

359
00:17:43,105 --> 00:17:45,542
me and Tee gonna be
the flyest cats up in that set.

360
00:17:45,673 --> 00:17:47,805
Hey, y'all heard that shit?
They gonna be the flyest.

361
00:17:47,936 --> 00:17:49,416
- I heard him.
- <i>Besides me, nigga.</i>

362
00:17:49,546 --> 00:17:51,418
Hold on. Let me show you
how the game go.

363
00:17:55,596 --> 00:17:56,423
- Yo.
- You already know.

364
00:17:56,553 --> 00:17:57,815
You good?

365
00:17:57,946 --> 00:17:59,991
- Hell, yeah.
- That's good.

366
00:18:00,122 --> 00:18:02,690
This right here--
this might be our new location.

367
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,344
Ain't this 12th Street turf?

368
00:18:04,474 --> 00:18:06,172
Yeah, but, shit,
you see any of them around?

369
00:18:06,302 --> 00:18:08,130
Yo, I'm telling y'all,
they know it's dead up here.

370
00:18:08,261 --> 00:18:10,089
We'd do better up there
by the courts.

371
00:18:10,219 --> 00:18:12,265
Hell, nah, nigga, there's way
too many kids there.

372
00:18:12,395 --> 00:18:14,789
We need to be somewhere that's
out of sight from everybody.

373
00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:16,095
- Everybody except her.
- <i>Uh-uh.</i>

374
00:18:16,225 --> 00:18:17,966
No. Y'all can't be around here.

375
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,620
Come on, Ms. Griffin,
we just trying

376
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,404
to get enough people
to start a friendly game.

377
00:18:21,535 --> 00:18:23,319
I know what kind of game
you're trying to start, Meech.

378
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:25,278
Now get your little hoodlums
and get the hell out of here.

379
00:18:25,408 --> 00:18:27,976
- We didn't even do shit.
- Look, chill. I got this.

380
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,934
All right, Ms. Griffin,
look, I got you.

381
00:18:30,065 --> 00:18:31,936
- Mm-hmm.
- I got you.

382
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:34,461
Man, fuck Ms. Griffin.

383
00:18:34,591 --> 00:18:36,506
Look, I got this.

384
00:18:36,637 --> 00:18:38,378
<i>Come on, we out.
Let's get up out of here. </i>

385
00:18:38,508 --> 00:18:40,380
That's yours, Tee.

386
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:45,820
All right, hey, bring it in.

387
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:48,649
Come on in here.

388
00:18:48,779 --> 00:18:50,564
All right, so I want
the same intensity

389
00:18:50,694 --> 00:18:52,609
- in tomorrow's game, you hear?
- Yes, Coach.

390
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:55,003
Put it here. Tigers on three.

391
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:58,485
- One, two, three...
- Tigers!

392
00:19:01,052 --> 00:19:02,619
<i>What's up, Coach?</i>

393
00:19:04,534 --> 00:19:05,840
Hey, get that for me.

394
00:19:08,408 --> 00:19:09,800
Well, you still got jokes,
Coach.

395
00:19:09,931 --> 00:19:11,846
Mm-hmm.

396
00:19:11,976 --> 00:19:14,675
That pitcher--
he got some heat, boy.

397
00:19:14,805 --> 00:19:16,503
That kind of remind me
of somebody.

398
00:19:16,633 --> 00:19:19,375
Shit. I mean, you was always
a good athlete,

399
00:19:19,506 --> 00:19:21,072
but your focus
was all over the place, boy.

400
00:19:21,203 --> 00:19:23,423
- Man, stop it, Coach.
- Whatever, man.

401
00:19:23,553 --> 00:19:24,641
Hey, look, I got to holler
about you at something.

402
00:19:24,772 --> 00:19:26,817
Okay.

403
00:19:26,948 --> 00:19:28,428
I'm trying to start my own game
up at the Ecorse Rec Center.

404
00:19:28,558 --> 00:19:29,820
Well, you got enough people
over there interested

405
00:19:29,951 --> 00:19:31,648
- in playing?
- It's baseball, Coach.

406
00:19:31,779 --> 00:19:33,737
People gonna go wherever
the game is, you know that.

407
00:19:33,868 --> 00:19:37,524
The only problem I got is,
ain't no shelter on the field.

408
00:19:37,654 --> 00:19:39,265
Get kind of hot out there.

409
00:19:39,395 --> 00:19:40,875
So what you talking?

410
00:19:41,005 --> 00:19:42,572
Just a dugout
and the bleachers.

411
00:19:42,703 --> 00:19:44,444
And what you gonna do
about the umpire?

412
00:19:44,574 --> 00:19:46,315
Was kind of hoping you could
help me out with that.

413
00:19:46,446 --> 00:19:48,796
Ooh, boy, that's a tough ask.

414
00:19:48,926 --> 00:19:50,450
I got faith in you, Coach.

415
00:19:57,674 --> 00:20:00,068
Los, what up, doe?

416
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,810
Up all night
finishing this book, man.

417
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:05,900
Ms. Kim is sick,
so I will be subbing in.

418
00:20:07,684 --> 00:20:09,382
Che Guevara looks great
on a T-shirt.

419
00:20:09,512 --> 00:20:11,210
I know, I got three,

420
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:13,864
but if we're talking
about real revolution,

421
00:20:13,995 --> 00:20:16,215
we are talking about Karl Marx.

422
00:20:16,345 --> 00:20:18,652
So I assume that all of you
did your reading.

423
00:20:18,782 --> 00:20:21,176
So let's do a layup.

424
00:20:21,307 --> 00:20:23,439
How many of you agree with Marx

425
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:27,704
that man cannot see beyond
his own material self-interest?

426
00:20:27,835 --> 00:20:29,750
Anybody?

427
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,752
- You, Kwamé.

428
00:20:31,882 --> 00:20:34,276
Descartes said, "I think,
therefore I am."

429
00:20:34,407 --> 00:20:36,670
Ain't that what separates us
from animals?

430
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,194
We can do anything we want
if we put our minds to it.

431
00:20:39,325 --> 00:20:41,544
Like pulling out
if you ain't got no rubbers.

432
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,591
- At least my dick get hard.
- Ooh.

433
00:20:44,721 --> 00:20:46,419
All right, Mr. Flenory,
watch your mouth.

434
00:20:46,549 --> 00:20:48,290
Now, everybody just settle
down, just settle down.

435
00:20:48,421 --> 00:20:50,597
<i>Let's take this another way,
all right? </i>

436
00:20:50,727 --> 00:20:53,339
<i>Short-term gain versus
long-term gain-- </i>

437
00:20:53,469 --> 00:20:55,732
how many times have I seen
a student drop out,

438
00:20:55,863 --> 00:20:58,518
thinking it's better
to take a shift at the factory

439
00:20:58,648 --> 00:21:01,521
than to study a few more years
for a better job later?

440
00:21:01,651 --> 00:21:03,349
Well, you know teen pregnancy's
sky-high right now.

441
00:21:03,479 --> 00:21:05,133
People got to do
what they got to do.

442
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,135
- Shut the fuck up.

443
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:11,487
Mr. Flenory, do you
have a rebuttal?

444
00:21:11,618 --> 00:21:13,533
You said
if a student studies now,

445
00:21:13,663 --> 00:21:15,404
he's gonna get a better job
in the future, right?

446
00:21:15,535 --> 00:21:17,754
But how do you know the job
he has in front of him

447
00:21:17,885 --> 00:21:19,278
ain't the best he's gonna get?

448
00:21:19,408 --> 00:21:20,844
Well, Marx is not trying
to prove that investing

449
00:21:20,975 --> 00:21:22,672
in the future will always
be the better outcome.

450
00:21:22,803 --> 00:21:24,370
You make it sound like
material self-interest

451
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,285
is a bad thing, Mr. Ryan.

452
00:21:26,415 --> 00:21:29,200
Sometimes that's all we got.
Look, I agree with Marx.

453
00:21:29,331 --> 00:21:31,333
A man can't see past
his own material self-interest

454
00:21:31,464 --> 00:21:33,335
until he knows
he's fully taken care of.

455
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:37,818
I got a question.

456
00:21:37,948 --> 00:21:39,602
Is your brother
gonna babysit y'all kid

457
00:21:39,733 --> 00:21:42,475
so you can go to class,
or are you gonna drop out, too?

458
00:21:42,605 --> 00:21:45,913
Hey, hey, break it up!
Break it up now! Now!

459
00:21:46,043 --> 00:21:47,349
Mr. Flenory, outside.

460
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:50,265
Settle down.

461
00:21:50,396 --> 00:21:51,962
- Pussy.
- Out.

462
00:21:52,093 --> 00:21:53,790
Relax, relax, relax.

463
00:21:53,921 --> 00:21:55,357
Game on Friday. Come on, chill.

464
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:04,758
Hey, Mama.

465
00:22:04,888 --> 00:22:06,281
<i>What's up, Pop?</i>

466
00:22:06,412 --> 00:22:09,023
Demetrius, we need to talk.

467
00:22:09,153 --> 00:22:10,459
Can I put this Chinese food
down first?

468
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:12,287
Boy, sit down.

469
00:22:16,944 --> 00:22:18,206
What's going on?

470
00:22:26,301 --> 00:22:29,348
I was doing laundry,
and I found this in your room.

471
00:22:29,478 --> 00:22:33,134
So you a policeman now?
Some kind of secret agent?

472
00:22:33,264 --> 00:22:34,875
'Cause them men
need weapons to do they job.

473
00:22:35,005 --> 00:22:36,355
What kind of job
you got you need a gun?

474
00:22:36,485 --> 00:22:38,313
- Charles--
- No, nah, Lucille.

475
00:22:38,444 --> 00:22:39,880
<i>We got us a man now.</i>

476
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:41,490
He don't need his mama
to protect him.

477
00:22:41,621 --> 00:22:43,013
<i>He done went and got a gun.</i>

478
00:22:43,144 --> 00:22:44,188
Pops, it's not like that.

479
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:45,538
Then what's it like, Demetrius?

480
00:22:45,668 --> 00:22:47,104
'Cause right about now,

481
00:22:47,235 --> 00:22:48,628
I don't think I want you
around my kids no more.

482
00:22:48,758 --> 00:22:49,977
So you found a gun,
and I ain't your child?

483
00:22:50,107 --> 00:22:51,370
Is that what you telling me?

484
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,588
No, that's not
what he's saying.

485
00:22:52,719 --> 00:22:53,937
Don't speak for me, woman.

486
00:22:54,068 --> 00:22:55,112
- My tongue work fine.

487
00:22:55,243 --> 00:22:57,245
Hey, what's going on?

488
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:58,986
Yo, I'm throwing your brother
out the house.

489
00:22:59,116 --> 00:22:59,856
I found a damn gun.

490
00:23:01,902 --> 00:23:04,426
All right, Pops, I'll be out,

491
00:23:04,557 --> 00:23:07,473
but y'all gonna be following
in my footsteps.

492
00:23:07,603 --> 00:23:09,126
<i>What the hell
is he talking about? </i>

493
00:23:09,257 --> 00:23:12,434
Nothing. Stop all this
foolishness, please.

494
00:23:12,565 --> 00:23:13,870
Our house is in foreclosure

495
00:23:14,001 --> 00:23:15,437
because we behind on the
mortgage.

496
00:23:15,568 --> 00:23:16,656
That's why.

497
00:23:18,353 --> 00:23:19,528
How's that, Lucille?

498
00:23:22,836 --> 00:23:24,925
Look, Pops,
it's cool, all right?

499
00:23:25,055 --> 00:23:26,579
This should get us
out of whatever jam we in.

500
00:23:29,103 --> 00:23:31,148
No. Stop! Let him go, Charles!

501
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:33,499
Charles!

502
00:23:33,629 --> 00:23:36,327
If you ever raise your fist
at me again,

503
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:38,329
I'll treat you like a nigga
on the street.

504
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:41,594
You understand me?

505
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,213
- Man, I'm out this bitch.
- Yo, Meech.

506
00:23:52,343 --> 00:23:53,606
<i>Demetrius.</i>

507
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:57,653
- Demetrius!

508
00:24:59,454 --> 00:25:02,413
I feel like I needed
this more than you today.

509
00:25:14,121 --> 00:25:15,862
Meech, I don't get why you
still live with your parents

510
00:25:15,992 --> 00:25:19,343
and y'all be just
fighting like that.

511
00:25:19,474 --> 00:25:21,476
That's how we show our love.

512
00:25:23,957 --> 00:25:26,307
That sound
real dysfunctional to me.

513
00:25:28,831 --> 00:25:29,745
It do.

514
00:25:33,444 --> 00:25:35,011
You still got that money

515
00:25:35,142 --> 00:25:36,665
I left you to go get
the kids some clothes?

516
00:25:36,796 --> 00:25:39,233
Yeah, but I can
always use more.

517
00:25:41,801 --> 00:25:42,976
Hey, where the phone at?

518
00:25:43,106 --> 00:25:44,499
I got to take this.

519
00:25:47,589 --> 00:25:49,678
I'll go get you a hot towel.

520
00:26:01,864 --> 00:26:04,345
- You miss me?
- I heard you were out.

521
00:26:04,475 --> 00:26:06,390
Man, I came straight to see
you and Zoe.

522
00:26:06,521 --> 00:26:08,828
Without calling first?
Do you know what time it is?

523
00:26:08,958 --> 00:26:10,394
Obviously, you don't,
or you wouldn't have came

524
00:26:10,525 --> 00:26:11,482
this late on a school night.

525
00:26:12,919 --> 00:26:14,703
Uh, I catch you at a bad time?

526
00:26:14,834 --> 00:26:16,270
Nigga, don't come
questioning me.

527
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,924
I ain't seen your ass
in two years.

528
00:26:18,054 --> 00:26:20,143
That's 'cause you stopped
coming to--

529
00:26:20,274 --> 00:26:23,407
Look, Mo, we can get into
all of that later, all right?

530
00:26:23,538 --> 00:26:26,106
I-I just want to see
my daughter.

531
00:26:26,236 --> 00:26:28,587
Lamar, I already told you,
Zoe is not yours.

532
00:26:28,717 --> 00:26:30,458
Monique, stop
with that bullshit.

533
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:32,939
You know I'm the only daddy
she's ever known.

534
00:26:33,069 --> 00:26:34,854
Look, get on your feet,
then we can talk

535
00:26:34,984 --> 00:26:37,204
about you and Zoe spending time
together, okay?

536
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,817
Look, um...

537
00:26:46,561 --> 00:26:47,910
I got her something.

538
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:53,220
You just give that to her,
and you tell her I said hi.

539
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:55,091
Bye, Lamar.

540
00:27:55,935 --> 00:27:57,980
What the fuck?

541
00:27:58,111 --> 00:28:00,417
Stay away from my bitch.

542
00:28:00,548 --> 00:28:03,507
- Next time, I won't miss.

543
00:28:03,638 --> 00:28:05,074
Yeah, fuck you!

544
00:28:08,034 --> 00:28:09,775
<i>I ain't never
been scared of a man, </i>

545
00:28:09,905 --> 00:28:12,386
<i>but this nigga Lamar,
he a legend. </i>

546
00:28:12,516 --> 00:28:14,083
<i>Let me just break it
down for you. </i>

547
00:28:14,214 --> 00:28:17,391
<i>Southwest Detroit,
River Rouge, and Ecorse-- </i>

548
00:28:17,521 --> 00:28:20,176
<i>pretty much
on top of each other. </i>

549
00:28:20,307 --> 00:28:22,875
<i>You can be on the corner
in Rouge, cross the street, </i>

550
00:28:23,005 --> 00:28:25,051
<i>now you in Ecorse.</i>

551
00:28:25,181 --> 00:28:27,967
<i>You go up one block from that,
now you in Detroit. </i>

552
00:28:28,097 --> 00:28:29,795
<i>A bunch of different dudes</i>

553
00:28:29,925 --> 00:28:31,666
<i>used to run
a lot of different sections. </i>

554
00:28:31,797 --> 00:28:36,062
<i>This one man used
to terrorize the entire area, </i>

555
00:28:36,192 --> 00:28:38,151
<i>pushing H
and robbing all the dealers </i>

556
00:28:38,281 --> 00:28:40,501
<i>till he got popped
on an assault charge. </i>

557
00:28:40,631 --> 00:28:42,546
<i>When Lamar went away,</i>

558
00:28:42,677 --> 00:28:44,461
<i>Visger became
the hottest block in the area. </i>

559
00:28:44,592 --> 00:28:46,202
<i>The 12th Street Boys</i>

560
00:28:46,333 --> 00:28:48,596
<i>had the bottom
near the shrimp joint popping. </i>

561
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:51,033
<i>We had 19th Street
by the store. </i>

562
00:28:51,164 --> 00:28:52,469
<i>While both crews was beefing</i>

563
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,820
<i>all over
all the streets in between, </i>

564
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:57,474
<i>Lamar's lawyer was running
an insanity defense, </i>

565
00:28:57,605 --> 00:28:59,650
<i>which got him four years
in the nuthouse </i>

566
00:28:59,781 --> 00:29:01,870
<i>instead of the big house.</i>

567
00:29:02,001 --> 00:29:05,221
<i>Then Reagan started emptying
the mental-health facilities, </i>

568
00:29:05,352 --> 00:29:07,267
<i>so the man who used to reign
over the region </i>

569
00:29:07,397 --> 00:29:09,486
<i>was back at the crib
after two. </i>

570
00:29:09,617 --> 00:29:13,229
<i>And the first thing he sees
is me with his ex. </i>

571
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,318
<i>But the thing
that really pissed Lamar off </i>

572
00:29:15,449 --> 00:29:16,798
<i>was all the corners
he used to run </i>

573
00:29:16,929 --> 00:29:19,888
<i>were now 12th Street and ours.</i>

574
00:29:20,019 --> 00:29:21,934
<i>And he was willing to do
anything to get things back </i>

575
00:29:22,064 --> 00:29:23,065
<i>to the way they used to be.</i>

576
00:29:34,294 --> 00:29:36,644
Lucille...

577
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:39,255
we need to talk
about this mortgage.

578
00:29:39,386 --> 00:29:41,344
Okay.

579
00:29:41,475 --> 00:29:44,130
Let's talk about it, Charles.

580
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:46,088
I go out here every day
and bust my butt.

581
00:29:46,219 --> 00:29:48,308
I bring the check over to you.

582
00:29:48,438 --> 00:29:49,875
How are we behind?

583
00:29:50,005 --> 00:29:52,268
I pay all the bills.

584
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:55,054
I also buy the food,
the clothes.

585
00:29:55,184 --> 00:29:56,838
<i>And you know what?</i>

586
00:29:56,969 --> 00:29:59,188
It's never enough.

587
00:29:59,319 --> 00:30:01,408
<i>That's why I went out
and got the job at Wendy's. </i>

588
00:30:01,538 --> 00:30:02,844
Everything was fine.

589
00:30:02,975 --> 00:30:05,281
It was all fine
until the car broke down

590
00:30:05,412 --> 00:30:06,674
<i>and we had to get it fixed.</i>

591
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,197
And I thought I could catch up,

592
00:30:08,328 --> 00:30:10,591
but I-I wound up falling
even more behind, and I--

593
00:30:10,721 --> 00:30:11,897
And how we supposed to pay

594
00:30:12,027 --> 00:30:13,681
for Nicole to go
on that field trip?

595
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:15,335
I'm not punishing her
for our mess.

596
00:30:15,465 --> 00:30:16,945
We can't cover it.

597
00:30:17,076 --> 00:30:18,642
Then you take your butt
up there,

598
00:30:18,773 --> 00:30:20,427
and you see the look
on Nicole's face

599
00:30:20,557 --> 00:30:23,996
when you tell her that she
can't go on that class trip.

600
00:30:25,562 --> 00:30:27,869
Deal with that, Charles.

601
00:30:29,349 --> 00:30:32,004
As a matter of fact,
you can deal with all of it,

602
00:30:32,134 --> 00:30:33,962
because I'm sick of living
like this.

603
00:30:34,093 --> 00:30:35,442
I'm sick of it!

604
00:30:42,188 --> 00:30:44,581
Lucille...

605
00:30:44,712 --> 00:30:47,802
I'ma do like I always do.

606
00:30:47,933 --> 00:30:51,110
I'ma figure it out.

607
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,851
Look at me.

608
00:30:55,244 --> 00:30:56,550
Baby...

609
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:59,945
baby, look at me.

610
00:31:03,122 --> 00:31:05,037
But you got to trust me.

611
00:31:55,565 --> 00:31:56,784
- Baby!
- <i>Hey, everybody.</i>

612
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:58,481
<i>Hey, hey, hey.</i>

613
00:31:58,612 --> 00:32:02,050
Everyone, this is Terry,
B-Mickie, and Sockie.

614
00:32:02,181 --> 00:32:03,660
Hey, everybody.
How y'all doing?

615
00:32:03,791 --> 00:32:04,661
<i>-How y'all doing?
- Hey.</i>

616
00:32:04,792 --> 00:32:06,228
Where's my mom and Nicole?

617
00:32:06,359 --> 00:32:07,795
She said they were
gonna be late.

618
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,579
Okay. How's the food?
Food good?

619
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:11,799
Everything is beautiful.

620
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,062
I'm so happy you did this.

621
00:32:14,193 --> 00:32:16,021
Now, can you please come
and sit down?

622
00:32:16,151 --> 00:32:17,761
A baby shower, babe?

623
00:32:17,892 --> 00:32:19,285
Come on.

624
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:24,420
- Terry, really?

625
00:32:24,551 --> 00:32:25,944
You can't leave.

626
00:32:26,074 --> 00:32:28,207
I told everyone
you were coming.

627
00:32:28,337 --> 00:32:30,339
Some of these people are family
you never even met.

628
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:31,993
Come on, babe,
I'm not about to sit here

629
00:32:32,124 --> 00:32:33,734
yapping with a bunch of girls
at a baby shower

630
00:32:33,864 --> 00:32:35,344
opening baby presents.

631
00:32:35,475 --> 00:32:37,738
I-I thought we were
doing this together.

632
00:32:37,868 --> 00:32:40,088
Babe, you got your girls
and your whole family here.

633
00:32:40,219 --> 00:32:42,221
But not the father of my child?

634
00:32:42,351 --> 00:32:44,136
I'm counting on you, Terry.

635
00:32:44,266 --> 00:32:46,399
I paid for the food,
the decorations,

636
00:32:46,529 --> 00:32:49,663
the liquor, but this
right here--this ain't me.

637
00:32:49,793 --> 00:32:51,143
I'm gonna hit you later and see
what's up with you, okay?

638
00:32:51,273 --> 00:32:52,971
No. No.

639
00:32:53,101 --> 00:32:54,668
Damn.

640
00:32:54,798 --> 00:32:56,148
I love you, too.

641
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:06,158
Shit.

642
00:33:24,959 --> 00:33:27,266
<i>-What's this about?
- You were speeding.</i>

643
00:33:27,396 --> 00:33:28,789
License
and registration, please.

644
00:33:33,881 --> 00:33:36,057
- That's not mine.
- You're right.

645
00:33:36,188 --> 00:33:38,190
It's your son's.

646
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,322
Fransciscus is a senior
at Saint Martin de Porres.

647
00:33:40,453 --> 00:33:42,063
A possession charge will stop

648
00:33:42,194 --> 00:33:45,023
any decent college
from admitting him.

649
00:33:45,153 --> 00:33:47,286
You don't scare me
with your gestapo tactics.

650
00:33:47,416 --> 00:33:49,810
Gestapo? Ain't that a bitch.

651
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:52,595
No, baby, this is Detroit.

652
00:33:52,726 --> 00:33:55,337
Look, you leave
the rec center alone,

653
00:33:55,468 --> 00:33:57,644
and I'll leave your son alone.

654
00:33:59,863 --> 00:34:01,039
Choice is yours.

655
00:34:20,362 --> 00:34:22,060
I just came to pick up
some clothes.

656
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:30,198
I need you to set
a better example for Terry

657
00:34:30,329 --> 00:34:32,331
or leave him alone altogether.

658
00:34:32,461 --> 00:34:36,117
Terry is like a sponge.

659
00:34:36,248 --> 00:34:38,511
He doesn't listen to me
or your father,

660
00:34:38,641 --> 00:34:42,341
but he soaks up
everything you say and do.

661
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,432
Demetrius...

662
00:34:48,999 --> 00:34:51,306
...we've done
everything we can for you.

663
00:34:51,437 --> 00:34:55,528
Put you through school,
you dropped out.

664
00:34:55,658 --> 00:34:58,270
Helped you get employment,
you quit.

665
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:02,274
Ma, who wants to work
a fast-food job?

666
00:35:02,404 --> 00:35:06,234
Nobody, including me.

667
00:35:06,365 --> 00:35:10,151
But I do it
to support our family.

668
00:35:10,282 --> 00:35:12,153
You think you better
than me or something?

669
00:35:12,284 --> 00:35:15,200
No. That's not what I'm saying.

670
00:35:20,814 --> 00:35:23,512
If you and Daddy believe
in the power of God so much...

671
00:35:25,862 --> 00:35:27,212
...why worry about Terry?

672
00:35:27,342 --> 00:35:28,604
- Don't.
- Or the mortgage?

673
00:35:28,735 --> 00:35:31,085
Don't.

674
00:35:31,216 --> 00:35:33,522
Don't twist my words
around like that.

675
00:35:36,917 --> 00:35:41,356
Ma, I'm not saying that, okay?

676
00:35:41,487 --> 00:35:42,792
Listen, you always taught me
the Lord works

677
00:35:42,923 --> 00:35:44,316
in mysterious ways.

678
00:35:45,926 --> 00:35:49,364
Ma, listen to me. I got money.

679
00:35:49,495 --> 00:35:51,540
Maybe I'm
your mysterious way, Ma.

680
00:36:02,377 --> 00:36:05,641
If you live long enough

681
00:36:05,772 --> 00:36:09,036
to see your children
make mistakes...

682
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:12,692
<i>mistakes that might
ruin their lives... </i>

683
00:36:12,822 --> 00:36:16,652
then you will understand
why I can't accept

684
00:36:16,783 --> 00:36:18,567
your money.

685
00:36:25,487 --> 00:36:27,185
Ma.

686
00:36:41,416 --> 00:36:43,592
- What up, doe?

687
00:36:46,552 --> 00:36:48,075
- Damn.
- That's for getting me

688
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:49,772
kicked out the crib
for that stupid-ass gun I told

689
00:36:49,903 --> 00:36:51,426
- your dumb ass to get rid of.
- My bad, dog.

690
00:36:51,557 --> 00:36:53,036
Yeah, you fucking right
it's your bad, man.

691
00:36:53,167 --> 00:36:54,037
I know you ain't talking

692
00:36:54,168 --> 00:36:55,038
with them rusty-ass ankles.

693
00:36:55,169 --> 00:36:56,779
Shut up.

694
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:58,433
Y'all looking like the high-top
brothers minus one.

695
00:36:58,564 --> 00:36:59,913
- That shit wasn't funny.
- Man, I don't know

696
00:37:00,043 --> 00:37:01,567
who hired this country
bumpkin-ass bitch anyway!

697
00:37:01,697 --> 00:37:02,872
The only bitch I know
is your mama.

698
00:37:03,003 --> 00:37:04,047
You better watch
how you talking to me.

699
00:37:04,178 --> 00:37:05,919
Yo, what the fuck
is going on, man?

700
00:37:06,049 --> 00:37:07,921
Kato over here slicing prices
like it's Black Friday.

701
00:37:08,051 --> 00:37:09,792
People don't have the kind of
money we charging--I had to.

702
00:37:09,923 --> 00:37:11,316
Yo, yo, yo. Hold on.
Hold on. Hold on.

703
00:37:11,446 --> 00:37:13,143
Our name is Fifty Boyz.

704
00:37:13,274 --> 00:37:15,450
We sell $50 bags of crack
all day, all night.

705
00:37:15,581 --> 00:37:17,278
It's slow as shit out here.

706
00:37:17,409 --> 00:37:18,888
I had to think on the fly
to make a sale.

707
00:37:19,019 --> 00:37:20,890
Look, look, yo.
This ain't no democracy, Kato.

708
00:37:21,021 --> 00:37:22,892
You do what we say,
or you get the fuck on.

709
00:37:23,023 --> 00:37:24,633
Everybody back to work
except Kato.

710
00:37:24,764 --> 00:37:26,244
<i>Slashing prices.
Ain't that a bitch. </i>

711
00:37:29,595 --> 00:37:32,293
You know this team's got
a lot of players, right?

712
00:37:32,424 --> 00:37:34,208
And I'm the only one
sweating on the field.

713
00:37:34,339 --> 00:37:35,862
The rest of 'em was backsliding
'til y'all showed.

714
00:37:35,992 --> 00:37:37,777
So now you a snitch?

715
00:37:37,907 --> 00:37:39,605
Look, our crew is like
an assembly line.

716
00:37:39,735 --> 00:37:41,389
It got a whole lot
of moving parts

717
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,609
and a whole lot of players,
but in order for us to win,

718
00:37:43,739 --> 00:37:45,567
everybody got to play
their position.

719
00:37:45,698 --> 00:37:47,134
Don't ever forget that shit,
or you could do like

720
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:48,396
my brother said
and get the fuck on.

721
00:37:51,573 --> 00:37:53,793
Wow. Yo, you told her, Meechie.

722
00:37:53,923 --> 00:37:56,143
Good shit. No slap
on the wrist or nothing?

723
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:57,797
For thinking outside the box?

724
00:37:57,927 --> 00:37:59,581
Nigga, 50 is our brand.
That's our name.

725
00:37:59,712 --> 00:38:00,756
That's all we got
in these streets.

726
00:38:00,887 --> 00:38:02,149
Man, I made my decision, man.

727
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,759
And you didn't even talk
to me about it,

728
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:05,544
nor did you say anything
before moving out here.

729
00:38:05,674 --> 00:38:07,589
'Cause if you had, guess what--
I would have told you

730
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,809
what a dumbass idea this was
without a marketing scheme.

731
00:38:09,939 --> 00:38:11,376
Nigga, we slinging crack.

732
00:38:11,506 --> 00:38:12,855
We ain't selling
no fucking beer ads.

733
00:38:12,986 --> 00:38:14,901
- Whatever.
- What if Kato's right

734
00:38:15,031 --> 00:38:18,644
and the streets ain't fucking
with our 50 bags no more?

735
00:38:18,774 --> 00:38:19,688
Shit.

736
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:23,823
Hey, B, what- what's the biggest
flophouse in Ecorse?

737
00:38:23,953 --> 00:38:24,954
<i>Shit, Pumpkin.</i>

738
00:38:25,085 --> 00:38:26,913
She like the E.F. Hutton
of crack.

739
00:38:27,043 --> 00:38:29,045
Whenever she talk,
them baseheads listen.

740
00:38:29,176 --> 00:38:30,438
What if we use that extra shake

741
00:38:30,569 --> 00:38:31,744
we got to cook up a new batch?

742
00:38:31,874 --> 00:38:33,572
<i>Don't step on it as much.</i>

743
00:38:33,702 --> 00:38:35,313
<i>-Hit it with a new stamp.
- Right, right, right. </i>

744
00:38:35,443 --> 00:38:38,228
Give it to Pumpkin and have
her ass spread the word.

745
00:38:38,359 --> 00:38:39,969
- God damn.
- What?

746
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,580
<i>That's a dope idea.</i>

747
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:43,103
You ain't never use
your big-ass head

748
00:38:43,233 --> 00:38:44,234
other for something
than a hat rack, nigga.

749
00:38:44,365 --> 00:38:46,062
Yeah, about time.

750
00:38:46,193 --> 00:38:47,281
<i>Yo, we wouldn't even be
in this mess </i>

751
00:38:47,412 --> 00:38:49,152
<i>if your ass hadn't caved in.</i>

752
00:38:49,283 --> 00:38:51,024
Do you brothers ever do some,
like, family shit, like hug?

753
00:38:51,154 --> 00:38:52,678
Man, shut the fuck up.

754
00:38:52,808 --> 00:38:53,679
Nigga.

755
00:38:56,203 --> 00:38:58,161
Nicole and my folks
are out for the night.

756
00:38:58,292 --> 00:39:01,426
It's smelling like money, boy.

757
00:39:01,556 --> 00:39:03,384
Nigga, put a shirt on.
We is not at Lawanda's.

758
00:39:03,515 --> 00:39:05,952
- Fuck you, nigga.
- I know.

759
00:39:06,082 --> 00:39:08,128
Listen, man.

760
00:40:52,928 --> 00:40:55,191
You see all this
motherfucking money, nigga?

761
00:40:55,322 --> 00:40:57,759
Yeah, nigga.
Nigga, we here, nigga.

762
00:40:57,890 --> 00:40:59,326
<i>What the fuck
are you talking about, man? </i>

763
00:41:08,944 --> 00:41:12,078
Ooh! Ooh-hoo-hoo!
Look at that, look at that.

764
00:41:30,879 --> 00:41:31,837
Appreciate you.

765
00:41:32,925 --> 00:41:34,796
Now, you know

766
00:41:34,927 --> 00:41:36,668
I couldn't let you be the only
one pulling up with a Benz.

767
00:41:36,798 --> 00:41:38,321
I see you. I see you.

768
00:41:38,452 --> 00:41:39,801
We definitely hollering at Pat

769
00:41:39,932 --> 00:41:41,542
about buying
our own shit tonight, though.

770
00:41:41,673 --> 00:41:43,544
Bringing that up tonight
might not be the move.

771
00:41:43,675 --> 00:41:44,806
Shit, oh, well,
that's the move we making.

772
00:41:48,201 --> 00:41:50,769
<i>Damn, girl, you clean up well.</i>

773
00:41:50,899 --> 00:41:52,248
What you thought
I was gonna have on,

774
00:41:52,379 --> 00:41:54,033
some gym shoes and sweats?

775
00:41:54,163 --> 00:41:55,556
<i>Okay, okay.</i>

776
00:41:55,687 --> 00:41:57,689
I see y'all over there
holding it down.

777
00:41:57,819 --> 00:41:59,386
If you ever over in the
Brewster's,

778
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:02,432
- get at K-9, all right?
- All right.

779
00:42:02,563 --> 00:42:04,522
Hey, this nigga seen us
how many times?

780
00:42:04,652 --> 00:42:06,611
And he never paid us no mind.

781
00:42:06,741 --> 00:42:09,439
Shit, after tonight,
everybody gonna know

782
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:11,485
who the fucking 50 Boyz are.

783
00:42:13,226 --> 00:42:14,749
- Welcome to Club Taboo.
- Appreciate you, boss.

784
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:15,750
- Enjoy yourselves.
- Yes, sir.

785
00:42:15,881 --> 00:42:17,012
Gentlemen.

786
00:43:00,186 --> 00:43:01,709
<i>Hey, baby, baby, baby.</i>

787
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:04,059
Yeah, let me get four shots
of Henny.

788
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:06,758
Make his a double.

789
00:43:06,888 --> 00:43:09,804
I'm just happy to see you back,
but, you know,

790
00:43:09,935 --> 00:43:11,458
I'm guessing your pockets
is kind of low.

791
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:13,808
If you want to fill 'em,
you run with us.

792
00:43:13,939 --> 00:43:15,418
I'm just saying a man
of your experience

793
00:43:15,549 --> 00:43:17,203
would be welcomed, in my crew.

794
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:23,688
Yo, do me a favor.

795
00:43:23,818 --> 00:43:26,604
Send some warm milk to them
day-care kids, all right?

796
00:43:36,570 --> 00:43:37,963
Told you that was a bad idea.

797
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,620
That nigga's
still institutionalized.

798
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:44,317
That motherfucker
took my drink.

799
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:48,016
Fuck that nigga.

800
00:43:59,549 --> 00:44:01,290
Man, that shit you pulled
in class don't fly.

801
00:44:01,421 --> 00:44:04,119
Man, fuck you, fuck you,

802
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:05,599
and fuck all of these bitch-ass
niggas you here with.

803
00:44:05,730 --> 00:44:07,166
Hey, do we got
a fucking problem, nigga?

804
00:44:07,296 --> 00:44:09,734
I know we don't got
no fucking problem.

805
00:44:09,864 --> 00:44:11,953
No, we good, bro.

806
00:44:12,084 --> 00:44:13,302
That's what the fuck I thought.

807
00:44:13,433 --> 00:44:16,392
Come on, let's bounce. Come on.

808
00:44:16,523 --> 00:44:19,657
Fuck out of here,
soft-ass niggas.

809
00:44:22,007 --> 00:44:23,617
Yo, that's that nigga Kwamé
from school?

810
00:44:23,748 --> 00:44:25,663
- Yeah.
- Man, fuck them niggas, man.

811
00:44:25,793 --> 00:44:26,533
<i>Right.</i>

812
00:44:33,409 --> 00:44:35,368
Y'all fellas
having fun tonight?

813
00:44:35,498 --> 00:44:37,022
Hell, yeah.

814
00:44:37,152 --> 00:44:38,458
Y'all looking too good
to be fighting.

815
00:44:38,588 --> 00:44:39,981
<i>Ah, we good.</i>

816
00:44:41,504 --> 00:44:42,854
See y'all later.

817
00:44:46,509 --> 00:44:49,687
Man, you see--you see me?
You know what I'm doing?

818
00:44:49,817 --> 00:44:51,166
- Man, come on, man.
- Chill.

819
00:44:51,297 --> 00:44:52,690
Pat over there, man.
Let's go, man.

820
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:54,517
- Fuck that nigga.
- Man, let's go.

821
00:44:54,648 --> 00:44:56,824
Cheers to my nigga Pat.
More money, more power, baby.

822
00:44:56,955 --> 00:44:58,086
Let's get it. Yes, sir.

823
00:44:58,217 --> 00:44:59,087
Whoo!

824
00:45:00,741 --> 00:45:03,875
Oh, there go my boys.

825
00:45:04,005 --> 00:45:06,921
Boom, I want you
to meet Meech, Terry.

826
00:45:07,052 --> 00:45:09,532
These are the biggest earners
in my stable.

827
00:45:09,663 --> 00:45:13,101
Nice to meet y'all, man.
This is my wife Markisha.

828
00:45:13,232 --> 00:45:14,233
Y'all boys look like
you getting it in.

829
00:45:14,363 --> 00:45:15,800
Hell, yeah.

830
00:45:15,930 --> 00:45:18,280
Got to, man.
It's my man Pat's birthday.

831
00:45:18,411 --> 00:45:20,239
Hey, y'all mind if we steal
Pat from you for a moment?

832
00:45:20,369 --> 00:45:23,895
Shit, it's his night.
Be our guest.

833
00:45:27,159 --> 00:45:28,682
<i>Yo Pat!
It's your birthday! </i>

834
00:45:31,554 --> 00:45:33,774
Yep, yep, yep.
Thank you. Straight up.

835
00:45:33,905 --> 00:45:35,863
- Here you go, OG.
- Oh, man. Perfect timing.

836
00:45:35,994 --> 00:45:37,125
Already know I got you.

837
00:45:37,256 --> 00:45:38,518
Mm-hmm.

838
00:45:38,648 --> 00:45:40,215
Token of our appreciation

839
00:45:40,346 --> 00:45:41,956
for everything you've done us.

840
00:45:42,087 --> 00:45:44,785
Man, straight up,
I love you little niggas.

841
00:45:44,916 --> 00:45:47,396
No doubt. No doubt, and we'll
be through tomorrow to re-up.

842
00:45:47,527 --> 00:45:48,920
Re-up?

843
00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:50,878
I just broke y'all off,
like, last week.

844
00:45:51,009 --> 00:45:52,227
Y'all niggas selling too fast.

845
00:45:52,358 --> 00:45:53,620
What the hell you mean?

846
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:55,404
Isn't the object
of the job to get paid?

847
00:45:55,535 --> 00:45:57,711
Get paid and stay yo ass
out of jail.

848
00:45:57,842 --> 00:45:59,495
Don't forget that part.

849
00:45:59,626 --> 00:46:01,628
Keep telling y'all
this ain't no 40-yard dash.

850
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:04,065
Look, Pat, we're taking every
precaution you ever taught us,

851
00:46:04,196 --> 00:46:05,588
and we definitely on point.

852
00:46:05,719 --> 00:46:07,155
Matter of fact, we want to cop
a brick of powder

853
00:46:07,286 --> 00:46:09,201
when we come get our bags.

854
00:46:09,331 --> 00:46:12,334
Meech, you ever hear
the expression

855
00:46:12,465 --> 00:46:15,076
"God don't give you more
than you can handle"?

856
00:46:15,207 --> 00:46:18,950
As far as our relationship
is concerned, I'm God.

857
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:22,910
Now, I'm always gonna have
your best interests at heart.

858
00:46:23,041 --> 00:46:25,391
And stop talking shop
at my party.

859
00:46:25,521 --> 00:46:27,741
Now, I'm finna go back inside
and get at these bitches.

860
00:46:32,964 --> 00:46:35,140
<i>Told you not to bring
that shit up here. </i>

861
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:43,757
Yo, it's cold as fuck.
What are we doing out here?

862
00:46:43,888 --> 00:46:45,846
Man, I'm so sick
of motherfuckers

863
00:46:45,977 --> 00:46:48,501
telling us what to do, and the
only way that's gonna change--

864
00:46:48,631 --> 00:46:50,372
we got to start
running our own shit.

865
00:46:50,503 --> 00:46:52,157
Yo, that's what
I've been saying, Meech.

866
00:46:52,287 --> 00:46:54,724
We got to be bosses,
but if we gonna do this,

867
00:46:54,855 --> 00:46:56,422
you're gonna need to learn
how to listen a little more

868
00:46:56,552 --> 00:46:58,337
and be more inclusive.

869
00:46:58,467 --> 00:47:00,730
Otherwise, it's gonna be
a short-ass reign.

870
00:47:00,861 --> 00:47:02,558
But what about Pat?

871
00:47:02,689 --> 00:47:04,299
Shit, that nigga put us on
and got us to where we at.

872
00:47:05,910 --> 00:47:07,389
So hopefully we make him rich.

873
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:10,697
- But I ain't waiting.
- Meech, that ain't smart.

874
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:13,743
Ain't nobody ever gave nobody
shit in this country, Tee.

875
00:47:13,874 --> 00:47:16,529
They didn't give us our freedom
or the right to vote.

876
00:47:16,659 --> 00:47:18,270
Nigga, we had to fight
for that shit.

877
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,098
It's the same way as us
fighting for our independence

878
00:47:20,228 --> 00:47:22,100
in this fucking game, man.

879
00:47:22,230 --> 00:47:23,275
So what you saying?

880
00:47:23,405 --> 00:47:25,799
Fuck being bosses.

881
00:47:25,930 --> 00:47:29,150
We gonna be kings, Tee.

882
00:47:29,281 --> 00:47:31,500
Kings of
the motherfucking D, man.

883
00:47:31,631 --> 00:47:33,981
Ha ha.

884
00:47:34,112 --> 00:47:36,679
These niggas
can't fuck with us.

885
00:47:36,810 --> 00:47:41,119
See it, touch it,
obtain it.

886
00:47:43,425 --> 00:47:45,732
- Oh, shit.

887
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:47,212
Yo, this is Wanda.

888
00:47:47,342 --> 00:47:48,909
I'm gonna handle that.
I'm gonna--

889
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:50,215
All right, go handle that.

890
00:48:01,313 --> 00:48:03,619
Oh, come here.

891
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:05,360
Come here, come here.

892
00:48:05,491 --> 00:48:07,580
- <i>Easy.
- I got it, Mama.</i>

893
00:48:07,710 --> 00:48:10,017
- Easy.
- I got it, Mama. Okay.

894
00:48:10,148 --> 00:48:11,366
No, no, it's me.
It's me. It's me.

895
00:48:11,497 --> 00:48:13,934
Oh, look at him.

896
00:48:14,065 --> 00:48:16,458
Let me see my nephew, man.

897
00:48:16,589 --> 00:48:17,938
Man, you know what you doing?

898
00:48:18,069 --> 00:48:19,287
Of course.

899
00:48:24,292 --> 00:48:26,033
Hey, little man.

900
00:48:28,993 --> 00:48:30,951
Oh, you looking just like
your pops...

901
00:48:33,649 --> 00:48:34,868
...and his before that.

902
00:48:38,002 --> 00:48:40,395
He got them Flenory feet,
too, so you already know.

903
00:48:40,526 --> 00:48:42,441
Better hush your mouth.

904
00:48:42,571 --> 00:48:44,617
- And so do you.
- Oh.

905
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:48,534
What are y'all talking about?

906
00:48:48,664 --> 00:48:51,363
<i>
- Nothing.</i>

907
00:48:51,493 --> 00:48:54,670
<i>Y'all better stop. Stop.</i>

908
00:48:58,152 --> 00:49:01,025
- <i>What up, doe?
- Tee, it's40, man.</i>

909
00:49:01,155 --> 00:49:02,765
<i>We supposed to meet
old boy by00. </i>

910
00:49:02,896 --> 00:49:04,898
Damn, nigga, we just got back
from the hospital.

911
00:49:05,029 --> 00:49:06,030
Give me, like, an hour or so.

912
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:07,683
<i>Nigga, hell, no, man.</i>

913
00:49:07,814 --> 00:49:09,076
Get your ass up out the crib.
We can't be late.

914
00:49:09,207 --> 00:49:10,425
Supposed to be there
in 20 minutes.

915
00:49:10,556 --> 00:49:12,950
It's okay. Go ahead. I'm good.

916
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:14,864
You sure you got
everything you need?

917
00:49:14,995 --> 00:49:16,866
<i>Nigga, I just heard Wanda
give your ass the green light. </i>

918
00:49:16,997 --> 00:49:18,651
Man, get your ass
up out the crib.

919
00:49:18,781 --> 00:49:20,783
We cannot be late. Don't speed.

920
00:49:20,914 --> 00:49:21,828
<i>Shut up.</i>

921
00:49:24,918 --> 00:49:27,225
Hey, baby, you sure you good?

922
00:49:27,355 --> 00:49:29,314
<i>Just go before I change
my mind. </i>

923
00:49:29,444 --> 00:49:31,359
<i>-How about that?
- All right.</i>

924
00:49:33,187 --> 00:49:35,320
Hey. Hey, he just-
he just smiled at me.

925
00:49:35,450 --> 00:49:37,278
- <i>Yeah, all right.
- Hey, little man.</i>

926
00:49:37,409 --> 00:49:38,976
You know
Daddy loves you, right?

927
00:49:39,106 --> 00:49:41,326
Oh, um, I think I left
his pacifier in the car.

928
00:49:41,456 --> 00:49:42,805
Will you bring it in,
before you go?

929
