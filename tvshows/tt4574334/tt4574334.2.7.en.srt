We can't all be fighters, I guess.

I'm a fighter. I've killed.

00:27:15,508 --> 00:27:16,426
Let's do this.

327
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:18,219
- Keep it running.
- Meet you around back.

328
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:29,731
[screams]

329
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:34,110
[audience laughing]

330
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:38,531
Punky, what's the matter?

331
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:39,615
A nightmare.

332
00:27:39,657 --> 00:27:42,660
I dreamt I was in the doctor's office.

333
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:46,873
All of a sudden, he's started to give me
my shot in my arm.

334
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:51,127
Then the needle got bigger
and bigger and bigger...

335
00:27:56,674 --> 00:27:58,259
[knob clicking]

336
00:28:07,268 --> 00:28:08,478
[Kali] Hello, Ray.

337
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:12,190
Jesus Christ!

338
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:16,277
[Funshine] Sit down. Please.

339
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:18,613
- I said sit.
- Please...

340
00:28:19,697 --> 00:28:22,992
Just, please... just take what you want.

341
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:24,702
[Axel] Oh, we will.

342
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:26,538
Where's your wallet?

343
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:29,707
- Bedroom. My bedroom. My jeans.
- Come on.

344
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:32,836
[Dottie] Yes.

345
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:35,588
[Axel] Got it.

346
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:55,984
Do you remember us?

347
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:05,243
What about us?
Do you remember us, Ray?

348
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:08,747
[grunting]

349
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,666
Please. Please.

350
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,377
You hurt Mama.

351
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:17,297
- [exclaims]
- [grunts]

352
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:21,676
[groans] Wait.

353
00:29:22,218 --> 00:29:23,386
[shakily] Please. Listen...

354
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:27,223
I just did what he told me to do.

355
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:30,560
He said she was sick.

356
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:32,937
You had a choice, Ray.

357
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:35,815
And you chose to follow a man
you knew was evil.

358
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:38,485
No, wait! No, wait! Wait!

359
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:43,198
I can help. I can help you find him.

360
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:45,617
- Find who?
- Brenner!

361
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,203
I can take you to him.

362
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:50,538
Papa is gone.

363
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,582
No, he is alive.

364
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:55,251
Do not lie to us, Ray.

365
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:56,795
I'm not lying!

366
00:29:57,629 --> 00:30:00,381
[softly] I swear... [whimpering]

367
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:01,549
He trusts me.

368
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:06,095
I'll take you to him.

369
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:08,014
If he's alive, Jane will find him.

370
00:30:08,097 --> 00:30:09,849
Just as she found you.

371
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:11,518
Do it, Jane.

372
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:14,646
- Do it.
- Wait.

373
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:22,403
[choking]

374
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:24,113
Not too quick.

375
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:26,282
He wasn't so generous with your mother.

376
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:45,188
[woman over phone]
Sweetie, just stay calm.

377
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,678
[Axel] Oh, shit!

378
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:48,888
The police are on their way, honey. Okay?

379
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:56,271
[gasping, coughing]

380
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:57,772
What's wrong?

381
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:00,149
- What's wrong?
- We got a problem.

382
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:02,819
[Dottie] Kids in the apartment.

383
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:05,280
[Ray] Please...

384
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:08,575
- Did he show your mother mercy? No.
- [Ray] Please. No.

385
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:13,371
- I'm sorry.
- He took her from you, without hesitation.

386
00:31:13,454 --> 00:31:15,331
Please don't. Please.

387
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:17,667
[Axel] We got to go, K.
They called the cops.

388
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,919
We finish this first.

389
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:21,170
- [Axel] Kali!
- Jane, now!

390
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,131
[Ray] Please, don't...

391
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:25,383
Please. Please.

392
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:27,302
- [gun cocks]
- [exclaims]

393
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:29,220
- [gasps]
- [glass shatters]

394
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:32,932
[police sirens wailing]

395
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:35,435
[Axel] Kali, we gotta go!

396
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,840
- [Dottie] Shit!
- [Axel] Go, go, go!

397
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:46,195
[Dottie] Shit!

398
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:48,281
Come on. Get in!

399
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:54,787
If you wanted to show mercy,
that is your choice.

400
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:58,291
But don't you ever take away mine. Ever.

401
00:31:58,374 --> 00:32:01,252
Do you understand? Do you understand?

402
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,221
[indistinct radio chatter]

403
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:17,435
[Funshine] I see you, and I raise you ten.

404
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:19,979
How ya like that?

405
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:27,737
That was a mistake right there, girl.
A mistake.

406
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:30,031
[Dottie] I think you're full of shit.

407
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:48,967
[knocking on door]

408
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:52,303
May I sit?

409
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:04,774
I was once just like you, you know that?

410
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:10,446
But that's why I'm hard on you,
because I see in you my past mistakes.

411
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,366
They were kids.

412
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:17,412
Does that excuse that man's sins?
Were we not also children?

413
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:23,793
I remember the day I came
to the rainbow room and you were gone.

414
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:28,423
So, when my gifts were strong enough,
I used them to escape.

415
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:29,632
And I ran.

416
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:31,759
I ran away as far as I could.

417
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:38,808
And it was there, far away,
that I found a place to hide.

418
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,644
A family.

419
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:44,229
A home.

420
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:47,650
Just like you and your policeman.

421
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:50,903
But they couldn't help me.

422
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:54,240
So, eventually, I lost them, too.

423
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,205
So, I decided to play the part.

424
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:03,666
To stop hiding.

425
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:06,544
To use my gifts against those who hurt us.

426
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:10,298
You're now faced
with the same choice, Jane.

427
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:13,926
Go back into hiding
and hope they don't find you.

428
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:16,888
Fight, and face them again.

429
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:18,222
Face who?

430
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:21,559
The man who calls himself our father.

431
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:25,855
Papa is dead.

432
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:27,578
[Dr. Brenner] That man tonight disagreed.

433
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:35,156
You're not real.

434
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:39,827
All this time?
And you haven't looked for me?

435
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:41,787
Why?

436
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,333
Because you thought I was dead?

437
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:48,628
Or because you were afraid
of what you might find?

438
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:50,880
Go away.

439
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,258
You have to confront your pain.

440
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:58,679
You have a wound, Eleven,
a terrible wound.

441
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:01,099
And it's festering.

442
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:06,354
Do you remember
what that means? Festering?

443
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:10,108
It means a rot.

444
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:12,068
And it will grow.

445
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:14,946
[echoing] Spread.

446
00:35:15,988 --> 00:35:20,034
- Get out of my head.
- And eventually, it will kill you.

447
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:23,246
[screaming] Get out of my head!

448
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:27,834
[crying]

449
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:36,217
This isn't a prison, Jane.

450
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:39,470
You're always free
to return to your policeman.

451
00:35:40,012 --> 00:35:42,723
Or stay, and avenge your mother.

452
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:47,645
Let us heal our wounds together.

453
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:07,373
- [laughs] Full house.
- Screw this. I'm out.

454
00:36:07,456 --> 00:36:11,961
- Out of money, you mean. You are broke!
- [laughing]

455
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:17,633
- You want in, Mick?
- [scoffs] Nope.

456
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:22,096
- Aw, come on! Just one hand.
- You're the worst.

457
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,347
[Dottie] How am I the worst?

458
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:25,558
Because, one hand leads to two hands,

459
00:36:25,641 --> 00:36:29,145
two hands leads to three.
Before you know it, I'm as broke as Axel.

460
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:31,022
- [Dottie] Are you in or out?
- [Mick] Out.

461
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,525
Today, tomorrow, the next day.

462
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:56,714
Maybe we can call you "El."
Short for Eleven.

463
00:36:57,882 --> 00:37:01,552
You'd better run!
She's our friend, and she's crazy!

464
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:03,554
[Mike] No, El, you're not the monster.

465
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:07,767
You saved me, you understand?
You saved me.

466
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:09,477
[Eleven] Compromise?

467
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:13,022
[Hopper] It's something that's kind of
in between. Like halfway happy.

468
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:17,443
Once we fix it up,
it's gonna be nice. Real nice.

469
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:19,237
This is your new home.

470
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:32,166
- [grunts]
- [beeping]

471
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:44,136
[echoing] That's where I was.
It's a damn graveyard.

472
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:48,015
I need to get through!
I need to get through!

473
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:50,810
- [Hopper] Whoa! Whoa!
- I need to warn them. It's a trap!

474
00:37:50,893 --> 00:37:53,896
I need to get through. It's a trap.
I need to tell them it's a trap.

475
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:56,983
- [Eleven] Mike!
- It's a trap! It's a trap!

476
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:59,151
Mike!

477
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:01,195
Mike! Mike!

478
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:04,282
Mike! Mike, where are you?

479
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:06,867
Mike! Mike!

480
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:12,164
[loud banging]

481
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:17,169
[officer] Go, go, go!

482
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:25,427
Let's go.

483
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:27,888
[officer] Don't move!

484
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:31,726
- [Axel] The hell's going on?
- They found us!

485
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:33,436
- Jesus! Jesus Christ!
- No, no, no.

486
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:34,729
Shh...

487
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:49,327
- [officer 1] Spread left.
- [officer 2] Right.

488
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:15,102
[Funshine] Let's go! Now!

489
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:16,937
- Hey! Hey!
- Jane, come on!

490
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:19,565
Come on, hurry!

491
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:21,817
Look out! Look out!

492
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:27,615
[screaming]

493
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:28,858
[officer] Get down! Get down!

494
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:36,957
[Axel] Do something, Kal.
Do something!

495
00:39:57,812 --> 00:39:58,896
Jane, get in.

496
00:40:00,272 --> 00:40:01,565
It's a damn graveyard.

497
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:04,527
- Mike!
- It's a trap! It's a trap!

498
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:09,532
I'm sorry. I'm sorry,
but I have to go back.

499
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:13,035
My friends... My friends are in danger.

500
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:16,122
This isn't time for a talk.
We got to go right now!

501
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:20,000
Your mother sent you here
for a reason, remember?

502
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:22,503
We belong together.

503
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:25,339
There's nothing for you back there.
They cannot save you, Jane.

504
00:40:26,173 --> 00:40:27,173
No.

505
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:31,804
But I can save them.

506
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:37,893
Jane. Jane!

507
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:40,354
Jane!

508
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:41,730
Jane!

509
00:40:57,788 --> 00:41:01,333
The hell was that? What's wrong with her?

510
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:22,855
[woman] You all right, sweetie?

511
00:41:25,107 --> 00:41:28,819
You were looking a little forlorn there.
You mind if I join you?

512
00:41:34,408 --> 00:41:35,409
Hmm.

513
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:43,250
[sighs] You are awfully young
to be traveling alone, aren't you?

514
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:49,089
Well, you are quite the chatterbox.

515
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:52,760
So, where are you headed?

516
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:55,888
To your parents, I hope?

517
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:01,519
I'm going to my friends.

518
00:42:05,814 --> 00:42:07,149
I'm going home.

519
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:17,868
