1
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:17,994
Hey, you reached Jim.

2
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:20,812
I'm probably doing something incredible
right now, and I can't...

3
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:17,535
It's like... It's like I feel
what the shadow monster's feeling.

4
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,497
See what he's seeing.

5
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:22,373
Like in the Upside Down?

6
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:25,251
Some of him is there.

7
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:28,254
But some of him is here, too.

8
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:33,510
- Here, like, in this house?
- In this house and...

9
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:36,596
in me.

10
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:41,518
It's like... It's like he's reaching
into Hawkins more and more.

11
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:45,522
And the more he spreads,
the more connected to him I feel.

12
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:47,690
And the more you see these now-memories.

13
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:51,486
At first I just felt it
in the back of my head.

14
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:54,155
I didn't even really know it was there.

15
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:57,325
It's like when you have a dream

16
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:00,870
and you can't remember it
unless you think really hard.

17
00:02:01,704 --> 00:02:02,914
It was like that.

18
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:05,208
But know it's like...

19
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:09,921
Now I remember. I remember all the time.

20
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:13,675
Maybe...

21
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:16,636
- Maybe that's good.
- Good?

22
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,263
Just think about it, Will.

23
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:21,349
You're like a spy now. A superspy.

24
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:22,851
Spying on the shadow monster.

25
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:26,855
If you know what he's seeing
and feeling...

26
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:29,482
maybe that's how we can stop him.

27
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,319
Maybe all of this
is happening for a reason.

28
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:37,991
- You really think so?
- Yeah. Yeah, I really do.

29
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:48,084
What if he figures out
we're spying on him?

30
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:51,838
- What if he spies back?
- He won't.

31
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:55,675
How do you know?

32
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:57,677
We won't let him.

33
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:24,494
Ugh!

34
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:06,120
Ugh!

35
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,550
- Hey.
- Hey. Did you get 'em?

36
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:43,634
Yeah.

37
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:14,040
We'd like a... uh, a room.

38
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:15,541
We got those.

39
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:19,253
You want a single or a double?

40
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:20,421
Double.

41
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:37,312
Nance...

42
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:40,691
- Uh, on or off?
- Hmm.

43
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:44,403
- What?
- Nothing. Just...

44
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:47,365
déjà vu.

45
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:52,036
Yeah.

46
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:54,997
Don't you think it's weird?

47
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:56,748
What?

48
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:59,585
How we only seem to hang out
when the world's about to end?

49
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:00,920
It's not going to end.

50
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:03,840
Feels like it.

51
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:10,805
Still have yours?

52
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,517
- Yeah.
- Mmm...

53
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,644
Yeah, mine's bigger.

54
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:19,480
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

55
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,250
What happened?

56
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:41,878
What do you mean?

57
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:44,839
To us?

58
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:49,927
After everything, you just...

59
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:53,848
disappeared.

60
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,354
Yeah, Will needed me.

61
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:05,735
And Steve...

62
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,405
I waited.

63
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:12,074
Yeah, like, only a month.

64
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,209
I want them off.

65
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:50,363
Will, what's wrong?

66
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:00,665
Mom?

67
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:02,792
Mom?

68
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:05,461
- Mom?
- Yeah?

69
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:09,590
- I saw him.
- You saw who, baby?

70
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:10,800
Hopper.

71
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:13,553
I think he's in trouble.

72
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:17,098
I think he's going to die.

73
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:03,102
Shit!

74
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:09,752
- That's enough, Erica.
- Uh-uh.

75
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:12,004
- Dad?
- Mmm-hmm?

76
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:16,467
When Mom's mad at you,
how do you make her not mad?

77
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:19,929
Hmm. That's a great question.
How do you, hon?

78
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:22,098
First, I apologize.

79
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:25,434
Then, I get your mother
whatever she wants.

80
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:26,936
Even when she's wrong?

81
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:29,730
She's never wrong, son.

82
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,775
That's right.

83
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:37,238
- Not hungry?
- Not really.

84
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:39,949
Where you goin'?

85
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:43,119
To hang out with Dustin.

86
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:47,581
Sorry.

87
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:03,764
Mews!

88
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:05,808
Mewsy!

89
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,853
Mews!

90
00:12:09,728 --> 00:12:11,439
Mewsy!

91
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:17,778
Dusty, baby, you're sure
she's not in your room?

92
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:19,113
Uh-huh.

93
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:21,116
If you'd like to make a call...

94
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:23,743
Thank you so much,
Mr. McCorkle. Thank you so much.

95
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,744
You are a true lifesaver.

96
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:27,538
All right, this was great.

97
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:29,206
Thank you. All right. Have a good one.

98
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,292
Bye-bye, now. All right. You, too.

99
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:34,420
All right, great news.

100
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:35,796
They found her?

101
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,049
No. But they saw her wandering
around Loch Nora.

102
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:42,303
How did the poor baby
get all the way out there?

103
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:45,014
I don't know. Lost, I guess.
But they're gonna look for her.

104
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:47,349
And I'll stay here,
just in case they call again.

105
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:50,269
And you're gonna go help look? Yeah? Yeah?

106
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:53,063
Give me hug.
Give me a hug. Go get her.

107
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:54,398
- You're gonna find her.
- Okay.

108
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:56,066
- We can find her.
- We can find her.

109
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,776
I love you.

110
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,403
- I love you.
- I love you.

111
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:00,863
- I love you.
- All right, go.

112
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:02,490
All right.

113
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:39,109
All right, Dart. Breakfast time.

114
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:48,118
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

115
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:50,037
Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit.

116
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:53,874
Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit.

117
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,753
Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit.

118
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:07,972
Come on. Come on, I know you're hungry.

119
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:12,685
Yes. Yes, yes, yes.

120
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:22,778
Yes.

121
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,613
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.

122
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,290
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.

123
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:37,792
Shit!

124
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:11,076
I'm sorry. You ate my cat.

125
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,708
All right. I think this is it.

126
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:21,045
Five-one-five Larrabee, right?

127
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:22,129
Yes.

128
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:24,006
Five-fifteen.

129
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:26,800
All right, "Five-fifteen." Sure.

130
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:30,178
Thank you.

131
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:32,014
Hey.

132
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:34,934
You apologize to your mama, yeah? Huh?

133
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,560
Must be scared half to death.

134
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:39,229
How long's it been?

135
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:40,856
Long time.

136
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,696
Go away! I'm not interested!

137
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:37,746
Look, I don't want your Thin Mints,
all right, kid?

138
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,416
- Thin Mints?
- Or your religious mumbo jumbo.

139
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,876
Whatever you're selling,
I ain't buying, okay?

140
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:03,939
I want to see Mama.

141
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:10,320
Name a way you occupy your time
when you're having a boring day at work.

142
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:15,284
- Drink coffee.
- "Drink coffee," said Mike.

143
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:18,620
Yeah! Five answers will beat it, Lynn.

144
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:20,456
Visit with other employees.

145
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,875
- "Visit with other employees."
- Rainbow.

146
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:26,754
- Three to the right. Four to the left.
- Mama?

147
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:30,049
Breathe. Sunflower.

148
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:31,216
Rainbow.

149
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,803
- Three to the right. Four to the left.
- Mama, can you hear me?

150
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:37,264
Four-fifty. Breathe.

151
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,059
Sunflower.

152
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:41,810
Rainbow.

153
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:45,064
Mama? It's me...

154
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:48,192
Jane.

155
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:51,236
I'm here now.

156
00:17:55,824 --> 00:18:01,413
Breathe. Sunflower. Rainbow. Four-fifty.

157
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:04,792
Breathe. Sunflower.

158
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,376
- What's wrong with Mama?
- Rainbow.

159
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:09,254
Four-fifty.

160
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,350
Are you positive
this is the right place?

161
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:28,565
"3833." Yeah.

162
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:31,527
All right.

163
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:50,879
Look at the camera.

164
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:55,134
- The camera.
- What camera?

165
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:59,179
Not the loudspeaker.
Above you, to the right.

166
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:09,773
Nancy Wheeler. Jonathan Byers.
You two are a long way from home.

167
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:22,870
Well...

168
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,915
I hope you didn't come all this way
to tell me about the bear

169
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,084
in the Harrington kid's backyard.

170
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:31,587
I've heard that one already.

171
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:46,268
Take a look. Go ahead, don't be shy.

172
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:53,192
I followed up on 200 tips,

173
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:56,570
most bogus, but that's how
these things always go, okay?

174
00:19:57,613 --> 00:20:00,115
I know every last step
Barbara took that day,

175
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,075
every last person she talked to.

176
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:05,078
The answer to what happened
to your friend, it's up here somewhere.

177
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:09,041
I assure you that.
I just gotta connect the right dots.

178
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:10,542
Timeline's wrong.

179
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:12,586
I'm sorry?

180
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:15,464
Your timeline is wrong.

181
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:21,470
And the girl with the buzzed hair,
she's not Russian. She's from Hawkins Lab.

182
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,263
Her name was Eleven.

183
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:25,557
You might wanna sit down for this.

184
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,460
If you're not out in an hour...

185
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:39,154
- Walking home. Yeah, yeah, I know.
- Hey! Watch the attitude, shitbird.

186
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:55,254
Sorry about that, Road Warrior.

187
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:56,964
What happened?

188
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:00,592
Short circuit in the motherboard.
A real bummer.

189
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:03,679
But fret not. I got another machine
up and running in the back.

190
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:09,101
Hold these.

191
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:24,283
You better get me that date now, Sinclair.

192
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:26,034
I told you I would.

193
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:29,496
And keep things PG in here, all right?

194
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:35,210
What is this shit, stalker?

195
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,838
Sorry. I just needed a safe place.

196
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:40,465
A safe place to what? Be creepy?

197
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:43,802
Listen. I'm gonna tell you the truth
about everything that happened last year.

198
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:46,513
But if anyone finds out,
you could be arrested.

199
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:49,641
Possibly killed.

200
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:52,352
- Killed?
- I need to know.

201
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:55,397
Do you accept the risk?

202
00:21:55,480 --> 00:22:00,527
- Oh, my God! This... this is so stupid.
- Do you accept the risk?

203
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,154
Yeah.

204
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:04,781
Sure. Fine.

205
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:06,700
I accept the risk.

206
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:13,582
Let's hear it.

207
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,168
Last year...

208
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,422
Will didn't get lost in the woods.

209
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:25,761
He got lost somewhere else.

210
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:39,316
Hey, is this where you saw him?
Is this where you saw Hopper?

211
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:41,234
I think so. Yeah.

212
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,360
Okay.

213
00:22:58,376 --> 00:22:59,377
Here!

214
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:09,471
Okay, so... so Hopper is here?

215
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:12,682
Yeah. Now we just need to find out
where here is, right?

216
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:13,683
Right.

217
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:16,394
Did he say anything?
I mean, before he left?

218
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:19,648
Uh, some... something about vines?

219
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:22,150
Hopper.

220
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:35,914
Surprise. I would've called,
but you said not to clog up the line.

221
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:38,959
You know, I... We're fine,
we don't need anything.

222
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:42,921
When I was sick as a kid,
and I was sick all the time as a kid,

223
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:46,174
nothing made me feel better
than focusing on these brain teasers.

224
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:48,677
Those are great. Ah...

225
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,960
I could teach him how to play.

226
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:52,305
You know, he's sleeping.

227
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:54,015
Okay.

228
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:56,226
I could wait with you?

229
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:59,146
Listen, it's just not a good time.

230
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:02,023
But, um, you know what?
I'll call you, okay?

231
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:03,650
Thank you.

232
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:05,735
- You sure?
- Yeah.

233
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:08,738
Well, have him call me. They don't call me
Bob the Brain for nothing.

234
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:14,452
Bob!

235
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:16,997
That's my name.

236
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:26,797
Huh.

237
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:29,551
Hmm.

238
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:33,471
- You drew all these yourself?
- Mmm-hmm.

239
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:38,768
- Why, exactly?
- I... I told you the rules.

240
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:41,396
- No questions, okay?
- Yeah.

241
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:44,482
We... we just need you
to help us figure out what...

242
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:46,526
Bob? Bob?

243
00:24:47,527 --> 00:24:48,528
Over here.

244
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:54,784
Where... where this is.

245
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:56,953
That's the objective. Find the X.

246
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:59,623
Yeah? What's at the X? Pirate treasure?

247
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:01,499
Bob, no questions.

248
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:03,584
Okay.

249
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:09,633
Let me talk to you for a second.
Hang on, guys.

250
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:14,221
Joyce, you can talk to me.
You know that, right?

251
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:18,433
Yeah.
What's the problem, exactly?

252
00:25:18,516 --> 00:25:19,643
What's the problem?

253
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:23,897
Joyce, Will doesn't look well.

254
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,565
You don't look well.

255
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:26,566
What's going on?

256
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,360
Nothing. Nothing.

257
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:30,443
Is this an episode?
Is this one of Will's episodes?

258
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:32,614
No. No! No.

259
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:35,575
I'm sorry. I just... I don't...

260
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:38,828
see how any of this is good for Will,
or for you.

261
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:42,249
And even if I wanted to play along,
I mean, how could I figure anything out

262
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:44,167
if I don't understand
the context of the game?

263
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:47,254
- Or...
- What?

264
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:50,257
- What is it?
- I know that shape.

265
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:52,384
It's Lovers' Lake.

266
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,639
It's Lovers' Lake. I get it.

267
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:59,975
Okay, I get. That's Lake Jordan.

268
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:03,853
And if that's Lake Jordan,
then you can probably find...

269
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:06,773
Yeah, that's, uh, Sattler's quarry.

270
00:26:06,856 --> 00:26:09,442
And if you just follow it naturally...

271
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:11,361
it moves to...

272
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,697
the Eno River.

273
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:17,075
And there it is.
That's the Eno, do you see it?

274
00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:20,453
Okay, so the lines aren't roads.

275
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:22,205
But they act like roads.

276
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:24,916
And they act like roads 'cause when you
follow 'em, you'll see...

277
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:26,751
they don't go over water.

278
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:29,754
And that's the giveaway.
That's the giveaway. Ha!

279
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:31,278
Don't you get it? It's not a puzzle,

280
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:33,091
it's a map.

281
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:36,011
It's a map of Hawkins.

282
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:41,307
Right, Will?

283
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:50,317
Does anybody copy?

284
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:54,779
Look, if anybody copies,
this is Jim Hopper, Hawkins' Chief...

285
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:16,027
Guys, this is Dustin again.

286
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:20,407
Does anyone copy? This is a code red.
I repeat, a code red!

287
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:23,910
I really need someone to pick up here.

288
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:28,289
Hopper's MIA, and I've got a code red.

289
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:30,250
Code red!

290
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:32,293
All right, it's Dustin again.

291
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:33,795
Seriously, I have a code red.

292
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:36,172
Could you please shut up?

293
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:38,007
Erica? Erica, is Lucas there?

294
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:41,136
- Where is he?
- Don’t know. Don't care.

295
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:42,303
Is he with Mike?

296
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:45,974
Like I said,
I don't know and I don't care.

297
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:49,853
Please tell him it's super important.
Please tell him that I have a code...

298
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:51,020
Code red?

299
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:53,314
- Yep, code red. Exactly.
- Mmm-hmm.

300
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:55,567
I got a code for you instead.

301
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:58,903
It's called code shut-your-mouth.

302
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,741
Erica?

303
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:08,163
I just need a little help
understanding, sweetie, okay?

304
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:13,543
Can you tell me where you came from?

305
00:29:14,377 --> 00:29:17,213
Where you've been all this time?

306
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:24,095
A policeman and a woman
came looking for you last year.

307
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,556
Did they find you?

308
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:28,183
She won't get better...

309
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:31,478
will she?

310
00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:35,148
They don't think so, no.

311
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:39,277
But she's not in any pain.

312
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:42,822
She's just stuck, they think.

313
00:29:43,823 --> 00:29:45,033
Like in a dream.

314
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:47,494
A long dream.

315
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:49,996
A good dream?

316
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:52,624
I hope so.

317
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:57,629
Is it the same dream?

318
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:00,632
We don't know.

319
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:03,134
Sometimes she says different words.

320
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:04,719
But usually those.

321
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:13,645
She always believed
that you were out there.

322
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:17,690
She always believed
that you'd come home one day.

323
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:21,653
Home?

324
00:30:21,736 --> 00:30:23,071
Yeah, home.

325
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:07,239
Pretty.

326
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:12,203
I can get you a real bed,
and you can stay here with me

327
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:13,288
if you want.

328
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:15,081
How's that sound?

329
00:31:21,337 --> 00:31:26,342
I wanna help you, but to really do that,
I need you to talk to me, okay?

330
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:29,596
Doesn't have to be now.
Doesn't have to be today.

331
00:31:30,763 --> 00:31:31,931
But when you're ready.

332
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:33,849
Okay?

333
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:38,979
Okay.

334
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:47,238
Oh, yeah, that.

335
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:50,116
That happens sometimes.

336
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:52,368
Old house, bad wiring...

337
00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:56,831
Or if you ask
my crazy aunt Shirley, it's...

338
00:31:58,833 --> 00:31:59,833
haunted.

339
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:17,769
Sweetie, really, it's just the wiring.

340
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:18,853
No.

341
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:36,162
It's Mama.

342
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:39,958
Sunflower. Rainbow.

343
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:43,544
Three to the right. Four to the left.

344
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:45,546
I don't understand.

345
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:47,674
Four-fifty.

346
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:49,842
She knows I'm here.

347
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:06,401
She wants to talk.

348
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:08,361
Rainbow.

349
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:15,326
All right.

350
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:21,082
All right. I'm 3.6 inches,
what do you got?

351
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:23,042
I'm not sure. Mrs. Byers?

352
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:24,252
Hold on.

353
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:34,262
- Twenty-one feet, four inches.
- What about Tippecanoe to Danford Creek?

354
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:37,098
Danford?
Where's Danford?

355
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:38,181
Dining room.

356
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:43,229
Sixteen feet, ten inches.

357
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:44,605
What about Danford to Jordan?

358
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:47,442
Oh, come on.
This has gotta be enough.

359
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:49,068
It's not. It's... it's really not.

360
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:51,404
Okay. Can't you figure it out?

361
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:54,115
Well, it's hard.
The ratio isn't exactly one-to-one.

362
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:57,201
I mean, if you're twisting my arm,
and you are twisting my arm,

363
00:33:57,285 --> 00:34:00,163
I would say that the X is...

364
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:05,626
maybe a half mile southeast of Danford?

365
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:08,129
Thank you. Thank you.

366
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:14,010
What? Are we... we really going?

367
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:21,517
I don't know, Cath.

368
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:24,103
Maybe if it was Margaret Thatcher,
that'd be another story.

369
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:27,690
Just a second, Cath.

370
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:31,069
Ted, can you get that please?

371
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:34,029
Sorry.

372
00:34:35,531 --> 00:34:36,531
I got it.

373
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:43,122
Your line has been busy
for over two hours, Mr. Wheeler.

374
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:45,333
- Do you realize this?
- Oh, I do realize.

375
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:47,126
- Is Mike home?
- No.

376
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:49,420
No? Well, where the hell is he?

377
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:51,464
Karen, where's our son?

378
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:52,715
Will's!

379
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:55,051
- Will's.
- No one's picking up there.

380
00:34:55,134 --> 00:34:56,803
Nancy. What about Nancy?

381
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:58,805
Karen, where's Nancy?

382
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:00,765
- Ally's!
- Ally's.

383
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:04,310
Our children don't live here anymore.
You didn't know that?

384
00:35:04,393 --> 00:35:06,771
- Seriously?
- Am I done here?

385
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:09,732
Son of a bitch. You're really no help
at all, you know that?

386
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:11,567
Hey! Language.

387
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:27,457
Listen...

388
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,001
I've been thinking...

389
00:35:29,585 --> 00:35:31,003
I love you. I'm sorry.

390
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:33,005
I'm sorry? What the hell am I sorry for?

391
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:34,090
Steve.

392
00:35:34,173 --> 00:35:36,300
Are those for Mr. or Mrs. Wheeler?

393
00:35:37,009 --> 00:35:37,885
- No.
- Good.

394
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,179
- Hey. What the hell? Hey!
- Nancy isn't home.

395
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:41,806
- Where is she?
- Doesn't matter.

396
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:43,850
We have bigger problems
than your love life.

397
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:45,017
Do you still have that bat?

398
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:47,353
- Bat? What bat?
- The one with the nails?

399
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:49,480
- Why?
- I'll explain it on the way.

400
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:52,400
- Now?
- Now!

401
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:45,953
Son of a bitch!

402
00:36:56,672 --> 00:37:00,092
Wait. Wait. No, no! No! No!

403
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:22,990
And that was the last
we ever saw of her.

404
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:26,035
After that, she was just gone.

405
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:29,914
I can't believe it's been that long.
Feels like yesterday.

406
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:32,833
Yeah. I mean, I bet.

407
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:35,294
- Wow.
- It's crazy.

408
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:37,129
I know.

409
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:38,714
It's crazy, but...

410
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:41,926
I really liked it.

411
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:44,637
- Liked it?
- Yeah.

412
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,556
- Well, I mean, I had a few issues.
- Issues?

413
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,350
I felt it was a little derivative
in parts.

414
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:50,685
What are you talking about?

415
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:52,687
I just wish it had
a little more originality.

416
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,313
- That's all.
- You don't believe me?

417
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:58,567
Lucas, come on, seriously?
How gullible do you think I am?

418
00:37:58,651 --> 00:37:59,819
Why would I make this up?

419
00:37:59,902 --> 00:38:05,574
I don't know. To impress me or something?
Or you're just, like, insane.

420
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:08,744
I tell you all of this.
I mean, top-secret stuff.

421
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:11,372
Risking my life.
And this is how you react?

422
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:13,040
Risking your life?

423
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:15,918
- Oh, so this is funny to you?
- Yeah. I mean...

424
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:17,919
kind of funny.

425
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:21,299
Stupid, but funny.

426
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:23,384
Where are you going?

427
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:26,429
Story time's over, isn't it?

428
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:33,394
What's wrong with you?
I gave you what you wanted.

429
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:35,896
I wanted to be a part of the group,
not a part of some joke.

430
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,189
It's not a joke.

431
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:38,983
You did a good job, okay?

432
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:40,906
You can go tell the others
I believed your lies

433
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:42,862
if it gets you experience points
or whatever.

434
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:47,158
We have a lot of rules in our party,

435
00:38:47,241 --> 00:38:50,202
but the most important is,
"Friends don't lie."

436
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:52,288
Never ever. No matter what.

437
00:38:52,371 --> 00:38:53,372
Is that right?

438
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:56,792
Then how do you explain this?

439
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:00,713
I had to do that. To protect you.

440
00:39:00,796 --> 00:39:03,049
To protect me from who, exactly?

441
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:05,468
The big bad government baddies
from Hawkins Lab?

442
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:06,552
Lower your voice.

443
00:39:06,635 --> 00:39:09,680
Maybe it was to protect me from
the Demogorgon from another dimension?

444
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:11,404
- Max, I'm serious, shut up!
- Oh, no, no!

445
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:13,517
You know what it was?
It was Eleven. The girl...

446
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:16,228
Stop talking.

447
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:19,565
You're going to get us killed.

448
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:21,984
Do you understand?

449
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:26,030
You're serious?

450
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:29,033
I really wish I wasn't.

451
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:32,202
Prove it.

452
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:34,622
I can't.

453
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:36,540
So what? I'm supposed to just trust you?

454
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:37,999
Yes.

455
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:46,884
Shit. I gotta go. Um...

456
00:39:47,843 --> 00:39:50,346
Don't follow me out. Okay?

457
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:52,973
Do you believe me?

458
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:02,191
The hell I tell you?

459
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:03,734
I'm not late.

460
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:05,361
You know what I'm talking about.

461
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:09,031
Oh, Lucas?

462
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:11,992
So he has a name now, huh?

463
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:14,203
It's a small town, okay?
We weren't hanging out.

464
00:40:14,995 --> 00:40:17,498
Hmm. Well, you know
what happens when you lie.

465
00:40:18,707 --> 00:40:19,708
I'm not lying.

466
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:33,639
What if they try to replicate that?

467
00:40:33,722 --> 00:40:35,362
The more attention we bring to ourselves,

468
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:37,726
the more people like the Hollands
who know the truth,

469
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:39,728
the more likely that scenario becomes.

470
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:42,481
You see why I have to stop
the truth from spreading, too.

471
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:46,569
Just the same as those weeds there.
By whatever means necessary.

472
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:52,032
So, is it enough?

473
00:40:55,202 --> 00:41:00,166
The tape recording, is it enough?
Is it incriminating?

474
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:19,602
- What are you doing?
- Thinking.

475
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:20,728
With vodka?

476
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:24,273
It's a central nervous system depressant.
So yes, with vodka.

477
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:33,491
Music? Really?

478
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:35,534
Yes. It helps me...

479
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:38,579
What? Think?

480
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:56,138
How long is this gonna take?

481
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:58,057
Longer if you keep talking.

482
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:01,810
Is the tape incriminating or not?
It's a simple question.

483
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:05,176
There's nothing simple about it.

484
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:06,917
Nothing simple about anything
you've told me.

485
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:08,400
You don't believe us, do you?

486
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:10,444
I believe you, but that's not the problem.

487
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:13,906
You don't need me to believe you.
You need them to believe you.

488
00:42:13,989 --> 00:42:15,282
- Them?
- Them.

489
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:17,493
With a capital "T."

490
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:23,707
Your priest, your postman, your teacher,
the world at large.

491
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:25,084
They won't believe any of this.

492
00:42:25,167 --> 00:42:27,169
That's why we made the tape.

493
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:30,339
Oh. That's easy to bury. Easy.

494
00:42:30,422 --> 00:42:33,759
He admits it. You heard it.
He admits culpability.

495
00:42:33,842 --> 00:42:35,594
You're being naive, Nancy!

496
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,221
Those people...

497
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:41,517
They're not wired like me and you, okay?

498
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:45,813
They don't spend their lives trying to get
a look at what's behind the curtain.

499
00:42:46,438 --> 00:42:48,107
They like the curtain.

500
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:51,277
It provides them stability,
comfort, definition.

501
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,361
This...

502
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:54,405
this would open the curtain,

503
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:57,032
and open the curtain
behind that curtain, okay?

504
00:42:57,116 --> 00:43:02,037
So the minute someone
with an ounce of authority calls bullshit,

505
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:07,626
everyone will nod their heads and say,
"See? Ha! I knew it! It was bullshit."

506
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:10,212
That is, if you even get
their attention at all.

507
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:12,056
You're saying we did all of this
for nothing?

508
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:14,383
I'm saying, I'm thinking.

509
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:18,971
Ooh!

510
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:29,773
This is ridiculous.

511
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:33,193
- That's it. That's it!
- What's it?

512
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:36,363
It's just too strong. Too strong.

513
00:43:40,492 --> 00:43:41,492
Better.

514
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:50,753
Perfect.

515
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:54,173
We water it down.

516
00:43:54,256 --> 00:43:57,134
- Precisely.
- Wait. What?

517
00:43:57,217 --> 00:44:00,179
Your story. We moderate it.

518
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:03,891
Just like this drink here.

519
00:44:04,683 --> 00:44:06,935
We make it more tolerable.

520
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:14,526
Perhaps Barbara was exposed
to some dangerous toxins.

521
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:18,155
A leak from the lab.
Like Three Mile Island or something.

522
00:44:18,238 --> 00:44:21,075
Something scary but familiar.

523
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:25,704
Close enough that it hits the man
right where it hurts.

524
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:28,499
And those assholes that killed Barb...

525
00:44:28,582 --> 00:44:29,875
They'll go down.

526
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:38,479
All right, what are we looking at?

527
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:40,909
This was some of the soil
we took yesterday.

528
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:44,306
Okay. So what is your concern?

529
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:47,309
Well, we didn't find
any signs of contamination.

530
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:50,020
Uh, nothing hazardous
other than some pesticides.

531
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:51,438
Well, it's a farm.

532
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:54,108
Right, right. Exactly. But...

533
00:45:24,513 --> 00:45:25,514
Like this?

534
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:28,266
Yes.

535
00:45:33,355 --> 00:45:34,940
It's okay if I sit here, right?

536
00:45:36,191 --> 00:45:37,067
Yes.

537
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:39,528
And I won't mess it up
or anything?

538
00:45:39,611 --> 00:45:40,863
- No.
- Okay.

539
00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:45,325
If you talk to Terry, will you tell her
that I love her very much?

540
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:47,494
And that I'm sorry that I didn't believe...

541
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:49,955
- Stop talking.
- Okay, sorry.

542
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:55,878
Breathe. Sunflower. Rainbow.

543
00:45:57,254 --> 00:45:58,755
Three to the right. Four to the left.

544
00:45:59,673 --> 00:46:00,674
Four-fifty.

545
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:03,010
Breathe.

546
00:46:03,886 --> 00:46:07,639
Breathe. Sunflower. Rainbow.

547
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:11,477
Three to the right. Four to the left.
Four-fifty.

548
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:14,354
- Breathe.
- Mama?

549
00:46:15,063 --> 00:46:18,442
- Sunflower. Rainbow.
- Mama, it's me...

550
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:20,360
Three to the right. Four to the left.

551
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:21,904
- Four-fifty.
- Jane.

552
00:46:22,529 --> 00:46:24,281
Breathe. Sunflower.

553
00:46:24,364 --> 00:46:25,491
I'm here now.

554
00:46:26,575 --> 00:46:27,784
Four-fifty.

555
00:46:28,827 --> 00:46:32,623
Breathe. Sunflower. Rainbow.

556
00:46:32,706 --> 00:46:33,874
I'm home.

557
00:46:34,541 --> 00:46:35,541
No.

558
00:46:39,338 --> 00:46:40,339
Mama!

559
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:54,520
Mama! Mama!

560
00:46:54,603 --> 00:46:56,021
- Oh, my baby!
- What do I do?

561
00:46:56,104 --> 00:46:58,333
- Mama, what do I do? Help me!
- Breathe. Breathe.

562
00:46:58,357 --> 00:47:01,401
Just breathe. Breathe.
Just breathe, all right?

563
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:02,653
They're on their way.

564
00:47:02,736 --> 00:47:04,238
- They're on their way, okay?
- Okay.

565
00:47:05,405 --> 00:47:08,116
Stay with us, darling. Stay with us.

566
00:47:42,776 --> 00:47:43,776
Hey, there.

567
00:47:46,905 --> 00:47:47,739
Jane?

568
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:50,200
- Where's Jane?
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

569
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:51,451
No, I saw her.

570
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:53,787
- No, no, she wasn't breathing.
- She was crying.

571
00:47:54,496 --> 00:47:56,790
- No.
- I heard it. He was there.

572
00:47:57,708 --> 00:47:59,209
- Who was there?
- He took her.

573
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:01,336
Don't take it out! Terry!

574
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:03,797
- Terry!
- No! No!

575
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:05,841
Please don't!

576
00:48:05,924 --> 00:48:08,719
Three to the right.
Four to the left.

577
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:37,914
Ma'am, can I see your badge?

578
00:48:39,499 --> 00:48:41,501
Stay back. Stay back!

579
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:49,968
Jane? Jane?

580
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:03,398
Jane... No!

581
00:49:03,482 --> 00:49:06,985
No! No! She's my child! No!

582
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:08,987
She's my child!

583
00:49:12,074 --> 00:49:14,034
No! No.

584
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:15,618
No.

585
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:22,918
No. No. No.

586
00:49:23,001 --> 00:49:24,294
Ah!

587
00:49:25,587 --> 00:49:26,713
Four-fifty.

588
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:42,354
Breathe. They're on their way.

589
00:49:42,979 --> 00:49:44,231
Stay with us, darling.

590
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:46,149
Sunflower.

591
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:48,902
Three to the right. Four to the left.

592
00:49:48,985 --> 00:49:51,780
- Rainbow. Four-fifty.
- Breathe.

593
00:49:51,863 --> 00:49:54,950
Sunflower. Rainbow.

594
00:49:55,033 --> 00:49:55,951
Jane... No!

595
00:49:56,034 --> 00:49:57,411
- Four-fifty.
- Breathe.

596
00:49:57,494 --> 00:49:59,996
- Three to the right. Four to the left.
- Breathe.

597
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:02,833
- Sunflower. Rainbow.
- Breathe.

598
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:04,811
- Three to the right. Four to the left.
- Breathe.

599
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:06,503
Four-fifty. Sunflower. Rainbow.

600
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:13,343
Sunflower. Rainbow.
Three to the right. Four to the left.

601
00:50:13,427 --> 00:50:18,306
Four-fifty. Breathe. Sunflower.

602
00:50:21,143 --> 00:50:22,978
There's nothing. There's nothing here.

603
00:50:23,061 --> 00:50:25,272
- Are... Are we close?
- We're in the vicinity.

604
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:26,582
What's that mean, the vicinity?

605
00:50:26,606 --> 00:50:28,900
It means we're close.
I don't know. It's not precise.

606
00:50:28,984 --> 00:50:30,026
But we did all that work.

607
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:33,697
I told you, the scale ratio is not
exactly one-to-one. We needed to take...

608
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:35,449
- Turn right.
- What?

609
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:37,075
- I saw him.
- Where?

610
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:38,410
Not here. In my now-memories.

611
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:40,787
- In your what?
- Turn right!

612
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:52,424
Are you okay?

613
00:50:54,509 --> 00:50:55,427
Superspy.

614
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:57,679
What's Jim doing here? Joyce?

615
00:50:57,763 --> 00:51:02,392
- Boys, I need you to stay here.
- No. Mom, Mom, Mom, it's not safe.

616
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:05,353
That's why I need you to stay here!
Stay here!

617
00:51:06,688 --> 00:51:07,689
Hopper!

618
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:11,443
Hey, be careful.

619
00:51:11,526 --> 00:51:13,028
Just going down the hole.

620
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:15,238
Vines.

621
00:51:17,824 --> 00:51:18,700
Give me that.

622
00:51:18,784 --> 00:51:20,994
- The shovel?
- Yes, give me the shovel.

623
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:35,383
I need you to help me
get down there.

624
00:51:35,467 --> 00:51:38,512
- Joyce, what are you talking about?
- Bob! Now!

625
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:52,359
Hopper!

626
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:55,153
Hopper!

627
00:51:55,987 --> 00:51:58,573
Hopper!

628
00:51:58,657 --> 00:52:01,497
- Joyce, what is going on? Where are we?
- Bob, are you okay?

629
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:04,663
Tunnels. Is this Will's map?

630
00:52:04,746 --> 00:52:05,747
Hopper!

631
00:52:05,831 --> 00:52:07,457
Are we in Will's map?

632
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:11,086
Hopper! Hopper!

633
00:52:11,169 --> 00:52:12,879
We're in Will's map.

634
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:14,381
Hopper!

635
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:16,174
We're actually inside of Will's map.

636
00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:17,258
Hopper!

637
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:18,969
How did he know all this?

638
00:52:26,017 --> 00:52:27,017
Bob!

639
00:52:27,727 --> 00:52:29,020
Over here!

640
00:52:29,771 --> 00:52:31,565
It's his.

641
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:34,442
He's gotta be this way.

642
00:52:36,027 --> 00:52:38,029
Come on.

643
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:42,659
Hopper!

644
00:52:45,912 --> 00:52:49,374
Do you see anything?
I mean, in your now-memories?

645
00:53:08,226 --> 00:53:09,936
Hopper!

646
00:53:10,562 --> 00:53:11,897
Hopper!

647
00:53:16,651 --> 00:53:17,651
What?

648
00:53:18,737 --> 00:53:19,737
This is...

649
00:53:22,407 --> 00:53:25,076
Oh! It's his arm.

650
00:53:32,208 --> 00:53:33,585
It's choking him.

651
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:35,795
Knife.

652
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:37,631
- Knife?
- It's over there.

653
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:39,049
Okay.

654
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:42,802
Hands!

655
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:44,679
Hands!

656
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:48,767
Cut it...

657
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:55,565
Bastard!

658
00:53:58,818 --> 00:54:02,238
Oh, my God.
Hopper, are you okay?

659
00:54:02,322 --> 00:54:05,367
- Joyce.
- Are you okay? Are you okay?

660
00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:08,745
- Hey, Bob.
- Hey, Jim.

661
00:54:08,828 --> 00:54:11,081
Oh, God!

662
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:15,335
Go! Go! Go! Clear the area!

663
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:16,252
- Go!
- Wait.

664
00:54:16,336 --> 00:54:17,545
Move, now!

665
00:54:25,637 --> 00:54:26,972
Will? Will, you okay?

666
00:54:28,723 --> 00:54:30,058
Will, what's wrong?
