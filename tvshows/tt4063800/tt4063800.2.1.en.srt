I can't go any further.

3
00:02:53,695 --> 00:02:55,765
Take off your hijab.

4
00:02:55,935 --> 00:02:59,166
The guardians of the revolution
don't come up here.

5
00:03:00,535 --> 00:03:01,809
Want some?

6
00:03:01,975 --> 00:03:03,408
I have my own.
Thanks.

7
00:03:06,255 --> 00:03:07,529
Beautiful, isn't it?

8
00:03:09,575 --> 00:03:10,564
This is Iran...

9
00:03:12,415 --> 00:03:14,770
What exactly are you building?

10
00:03:14,935 --> 00:03:17,768
I already told you:
An electric transformer.

11
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:22,930
An electric transformer.

12
00:03:30,175 --> 00:03:33,611
I can't take accurate readings

13
00:03:33,775 --> 00:03:37,085
if you don't tell me
what you're really building.

14
00:03:38,295 --> 00:03:40,490
You're a seismologist,
not a spy.

15
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:45,013
You ask too many questions.

16
00:03:45,455 --> 00:03:46,774
Sorry.

17
00:04:02,735 --> 00:04:04,088
Did you feel that?

18
00:04:09,975 --> 00:04:11,203
Are you scared?

19
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:13,809
Iranians get scared
when the earth shakes.

20
00:04:13,975 --> 00:04:15,533
It was a little one.

21
00:04:16,335 --> 00:04:18,451
Could bigger ones be coming?

22
00:04:19,615 --> 00:04:24,484
That's why I take readings.
To answer that question, right?

Excuse me.

33
00:06:29,935 --> 00:06:32,085
You asked how it was going
with Aladdin.

34
00:06:32,255 --> 00:06:33,847
She's making progress.

35
00:06:34,255 --> 00:06:35,529
For Guillaume...

36
00:06:35,815 --> 00:06:37,373
He's at lunch.

CLASSIFIED

38
00:06:45,895 --> 00:06:49,331
This is my first lunch
with someone from the T.D.

39
00:06:49,495 --> 00:06:51,372
We're no longer
the ''Technical Department''.

40
00:06:51,535 --> 00:06:54,607
We're now the E.B.
''Eavesdropping Bastards''.

41
00:06:58,975 --> 00:07:00,169
Water?

42
00:07:04,015 --> 00:07:05,653
What do you do at the T. D?

43
00:07:07,175 --> 00:07:09,643
And you at Intelligence?

44
00:07:10,775 --> 00:07:14,211
- You don't know?
- We don't eavesdrop internally yet.

45
00:07:14,695 --> 00:07:16,686
In that case, we can chat.

46
00:07:17,295 --> 00:07:19,092
Let's say, I handle the Middle East...

47
00:07:19,255 --> 00:07:21,644
Let's say, I handle Europe...

48
00:07:21,815 --> 00:07:23,965
I work for the Bureau.

49
00:07:26,055 --> 00:07:29,172
I take a special interest
in our American ''friends''.

50
00:07:33,935 --> 00:07:34,924
Enjoy.

51
00:07:48,015 --> 00:07:49,767

Then we'll have a real session,

95
00:14:53,815 --> 00:14:55,965
You could use one.

96
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,650
You're so careful.

97
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:01,568
Are you that worried about being caught?

98
00:15:03,255 --> 00:15:05,849
Of being caught
before Nadia is released.

99
00:15:06,015 --> 00:15:07,733
After, it doesn't matter.

100
00:15:11,855 --> 00:15:13,004

US Communications?

If you need to know

108
00:15:36,455 --> 00:15:40,368
the names of American agents in Europe

An operation was attempted.

114
00:15:57,575 --> 00:15:59,531
- When?
- Very recently.

115
00:15:59,975 --> 00:16:02,125
Why didn't you tell me?
Where?

116
00:16:02,615 --> 00:16:06,244
Southern Lebanon.
Hezbollah was moving Nadia El-Mansour.

117
00:16:06,415 --> 00:16:08,133
And the CIA saw an opportunity.

118
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:10,804
But it failed.

119
00:16:11,655 --> 00:16:12,724
I'm sorry.

120
00:16:14,935 --> 00:16:16,050
Is she OK?

121
00:16:17,015 --> 00:16:20,087
We waited to make sure
she was in good health.

122
00:16:21,975 --> 00:16:22,964
Where is she now?

123
00:16:23,335 --> 00:16:25,212
Awaiting transfer to Syria.

124
00:16:25,815 --> 00:16:27,009
To Damascus.

125
00:16:34,295 --> 00:16:37,207
Well done.
Now Bashar knows she's valuable.

126
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:44,493
This was all for nothing.

127
00:17:06,495 --> 00:17:07,325
<i>I quit.</i>

128
00:17:07,495 --> 00:17:08,814
I don't understand.

129
00:17:17,695 --> 00:17:21,244
You can't. If you do,
the CIA will blow your cover.

130
00:17:35,535 --> 00:17:37,287
Hello, Dr. Bertrand?

131
00:17:37,455 --> 00:17:39,173

132
00:17:39,615 --> 00:17:41,333

133
00:17:41,735 --> 00:17:42,724

<i>and how to repair my mistakes.</i>

139
00:18:25,655 --> 00:18:27,850
<i>But this mistake can't be fixed.</i>

140
00:18:54,455 --> 00:18:55,365
Hi.

141
00:18:56,655 --> 00:18:57,849
- Did they start?
- No.

142
00:18:58,215 --> 00:18:59,933
- Who's on it?
- Some girl.

143
00:19:00,135 --> 00:19:01,727
- A girl?
- Cute...

144
00:19:13,415 --> 00:19:14,609
Hello.

145
00:19:16,215 --> 00:19:17,614
- How are you?
- Good.

146
00:19:17,855 --> 00:19:18,492
Who are you?

147
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:21,044
Celine Delorme, Syrian desk.
Counter-terrorism.

148
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:21,931
Syrian desk?

149
00:19:23,655 --> 00:19:26,886
You're wondering why
Cyclone in Algiers interests us.

150
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:30,492
He met interesting people
while in captivity?

151
00:19:30,735 --> 00:19:32,407
Not while in captivity.

152
00:19:37,095 --> 00:19:38,767
The night you drank...

153
00:19:39,575 --> 00:19:42,248
I was at the Sheraton,
with Michael Lavrov.

154
00:19:42,775 --> 00:19:43,764
A Russian client.

155
00:19:43,935 --> 00:19:46,244
I managed his money.
We did business together.

156
00:19:46,975 --> 00:19:48,408
What kind of business?

157
00:19:48,695 --> 00:19:50,686
Commodity Day Trading.

158
00:19:51,295 --> 00:19:55,049
We moved funds around accounts,
in linked transactions.

159
00:19:55,215 --> 00:19:57,171
Almost-legal speculating.

160
00:19:58,095 --> 00:19:59,050
Almost?

161
00:20:00,935 --> 00:20:03,654
You don't know about
''almost-legal'' activities?

162
00:20:04,055 --> 00:20:05,044
I don't.

163
00:20:06,575 --> 00:20:08,008
You're so young...

164
00:20:09,535 --> 00:20:11,093
Not as young as I look.

165
00:20:11,255 --> 00:20:12,449
How old are you?

166
00:20:16,455 --> 00:20:19,686
How much longer will this take?
We're going in circles.

167
00:20:20,295 --> 00:20:21,774
That's not your call.

168
00:20:21,935 --> 00:20:25,689
Did this Russian introduce you
to other potential clients?

169
00:20:26,895 --> 00:20:27,725
No.

170
00:20:28,775 --> 00:20:30,527
The accounts were in his name?

171
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:33,334
Off-shore companies.

172
00:20:33,895 --> 00:20:36,773
You didn't always know
who the profits went to?

173
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:41,809
Like I said,
we used various accounts.

174
00:20:42,815 --> 00:20:47,127
Your quasi-legal activities
may have compensated certain Syrians.

175
00:20:47,695 --> 00:20:50,732
So we're going to go through everything
in detail,

176
00:20:51,175 --> 00:20:52,688
in order to verify.

177
00:20:53,295 --> 00:20:55,604
You think I funded
Bashar al-Assad's war?

178
00:21:02,935 --> 00:21:03,890
Excuse me.

179
00:21:07,135 --> 00:21:08,887
Not exactly going in circles...

180
00:21:23,735 --> 00:21:26,090
This just came in. It's ISIS.

181
00:21:26,735 --> 00:21:28,646
Obviously, I have to...

182
00:21:30,415 --> 00:21:33,646
Turn off the sound and speed it up.
Sometimes that helps.

183
00:21:36,455 --> 00:21:39,049
I break into parts.
That also works...

184
00:22:07,335 --> 00:22:09,644
You can't hit ''pause'' every 10 seconds.

185
00:22:10,895 --> 00:22:12,248
Go ahead.

186
00:22:31,295 --> 00:22:32,410
It's over.

187
00:22:33,375 --> 00:22:34,888
You've done the hard part.

188
00:22:39,255 --> 00:22:40,927
It'll be easier next time.

189
00:22:41,975 --> 00:22:43,408
You'll get used to it.

190
00:22:45,055 --> 00:22:48,172
In a few days,
you'll be used to it.

191
00:22:58,135 --> 00:22:59,284
He's French!

192
00:23:01,095 --> 00:23:02,926
The executioner is French!

193
00:23:06,335 --> 00:23:08,246
<i>France is no longer</i>
<i>the Church's daughter.</i>

194
00:23:08,415 --> 00:23:10,406
<i>By my sword,</i>
<i>she is the hand of Allah.</i>

195
00:23:11,695 --> 00:23:13,606
I thought he was still in Japan.

196
00:23:13,775 --> 00:23:15,288
He's already in Seoul.

197
00:23:18,455 --> 00:23:20,093
The embassy's on the line.

198
00:23:24,655 --> 00:23:26,566
<i>The President of France...</i>

199
00:23:28,775 --> 00:23:30,652
- <i>Gentlemen.</i>
- Mr. President.

200
00:23:30,935 --> 00:23:32,050
<i>Hello, Pierre.</i>

201
00:23:37,015 --> 00:23:39,927
<i>Are we sure the executioner is French?</i>

202
00:23:40,095 --> 00:23:41,494
99% sure.

203
00:23:42,095 --> 00:23:43,210
<i>Is he identified?</i>

204
00:23:43,375 --> 00:23:46,811
Not yet, Mr. President.
We're doing our utmost.

205
00:23:46,975 --> 00:23:49,443
<i>How many hostages could he execute?</i>

206
00:23:49,975 --> 00:23:52,535
His group currently has five hostages:

207
00:23:52,695 --> 00:23:56,244
1 Jordanian, 1 German,
2 Italians and 1 American.

208
00:23:57,135 --> 00:24:00,207
- <i>Do we have his location?</i>
- Most probably in Iraq.

209
00:24:01,495 --> 00:24:03,167
<i>How long until we have an ID?</i>

210
00:24:05,295 --> 00:24:06,489
One week.

211
00:24:07,255 --> 00:24:08,574
<i>That's conservative.</i>

212
00:24:10,775 --> 00:24:11,969
Four days.

213
00:24:12,135 --> 00:24:14,968
Our entire staff and technical teams

214
00:24:15,135 --> 00:24:18,684
on facial and voice recognition,
are on call 24/7.

215
00:24:19,255 --> 00:24:22,645
<i>In four days, we'll know who he is.</i>
<i>Can we stop him?</i>

216
00:24:24,495 --> 00:24:27,487
- I don't want to be conservative.
- <i>Don't be.</i>

217
00:24:28,335 --> 00:24:29,734
50%...

218
00:24:30,535 --> 00:24:33,413
- Many factors...
- <i>We held his hand.</i>

219
00:24:33,575 --> 00:24:35,850
<i>We executed that hostage.</i>

220
00:24:36,015 --> 00:24:40,964
<i>We gave birth to his killer.</i>
<i>We fed, educated and cared for him.</i>

221
00:24:41,255 --> 00:24:44,930
<i>Yet, he eluded us.</i>
<i>We have failed on all counts:</i>

222
00:24:45,095 --> 00:24:49,213
<i>Education, repression,</i>
<i>surveillance and anticipation.</i>

223
00:24:49,375 --> 00:24:53,891
<i>France can't be the global showcase of</i>
<i>barbarianism. This will not happen again.</i>

224
00:27:00,135 --> 00:27:02,649
- Hi there.
- Hi.

225
00:27:02,975 --> 00:27:03,691
Hi.

226
00:27:04,735 --> 00:27:05,770
Hi.

227
00:27:06,175 --> 00:27:09,292
- Is this your first party at Shapur's?
- It is.

228
00:27:09,535 --> 00:27:11,253
Asan invited me.

229
00:27:11,415 --> 00:27:12,894
I work with him.

230
00:27:14,535 --> 00:27:16,412
I'm French. Marina.

231
00:27:17,415 --> 00:27:19,690
Daria.
I'm co-hosting Shapur's party.

232
00:27:27,095 --> 00:27:28,130
You into mullahs?

233
00:27:29,095 --> 00:27:31,928
- Not particularly, no...
- Then make up your eyes!

234
00:27:33,775 --> 00:27:35,094
And flaunt your stuff.

235
00:27:35,255 --> 00:27:37,644
It'll annoy them,
and you'll feel good.

236
00:28:08,535 --> 00:28:09,524
No thanks.

237
00:28:15,015 --> 00:28:17,688
See?
We know how to have fun in Iran.

238
00:28:17,855 --> 00:28:19,413
Just like Beverly Hills...

239
00:28:35,055 --> 00:28:36,408
Who is she?

240
00:28:36,615 --> 00:28:37,764
Shapur's girlfriend.

241
00:28:38,615 --> 00:28:40,890
She definitely knows how to have fun.

242
00:28:51,655 --> 00:28:52,974
Asan, you like the stars?

243
00:28:54,695 --> 00:28:56,094
You're a poet.

244
00:28:57,175 --> 00:28:58,164
You like stars, right?

245
00:28:59,255 --> 00:29:01,007
Looking at them...

246
00:29:01,815 --> 00:29:03,453
Do they make you hard?

247
00:29:03,975 --> 00:29:05,454
Not particularly.

248
00:29:05,615 --> 00:29:08,334
I'm here with a friend,
not looking at the stars.

249
00:29:08,815 --> 00:29:10,009
So, you're not hard?

250
00:29:39,095 --> 00:29:40,608
Now, look at the stars.

251
00:30:04,575 --> 00:30:07,533
- <i>Axa Insurance.</i>
- Hi, this is Marina Loiseau.

252
00:30:07,695 --> 00:30:10,687
I'm in Iran.
I'm having an asthma attack.

253
00:30:10,855 --> 00:30:14,086
My inhaler isn't helping.
What should I do?

254
00:30:14,255 --> 00:30:17,565
<i>On a scale of 1 to 5,</i>
<i>how powerful is the attack?</i>

255
00:30:18,455 --> 00:30:19,410
3...

256
00:30:19,855 --> 00:30:20,765
<i>Very good.</i>

257
00:30:21,295 --> 00:30:22,489
<i>Try to relax.</i>

258
00:30:22,655 --> 00:30:24,452
<i>Do you have cortisone on you?</i>

259
00:30:25,015 --> 00:30:28,132
- <i>Take one tablet and call tomorrow.</i>
- OK, thanks.

260
00:30:35,775 --> 00:30:38,528
This is Aladdin,
our target for the past 2 months.

261
00:30:40,775 --> 00:30:42,288
The nuclear engineer...

262
00:30:43,575 --> 00:30:45,167
How are we doing?

263
00:30:45,455 --> 00:30:48,413
We're making a list of the intel
he has access to.

264
00:30:49,135 --> 00:30:51,854
It appears to fit
with our shopping list.

265
00:30:52,015 --> 00:30:54,575
We'll submit it to you once we're done.

266
00:30:55,815 --> 00:30:57,089
This is Raging Bull?

267
00:30:57,935 --> 00:30:59,971
That's right.
Shapur Zamani.

268
00:31:00,535 --> 00:31:02,173
His father, Majid Zamani,

269
00:31:02,335 --> 00:31:05,247
advises the government
on strategic issues.

270
00:31:06,055 --> 00:31:09,525
An important, influential man.
An Iranian ''eminence grise''.

271
00:31:10,935 --> 00:31:13,403
He has Rohani's ear
on all things nuclear:

272
00:31:13,575 --> 00:31:16,692
Awarding of contracts,
international agreements, etc.

273
00:31:16,855 --> 00:31:17,924
Is he a target?

274
00:31:18,095 --> 00:31:19,892
- Not the father.
- The son?

275
00:31:21,575 --> 00:31:22,644
Perhaps.

276
00:31:22,815 --> 00:31:25,932
It's risky.
We don't know what he's worth.

277
00:31:26,655 --> 00:31:30,443
He just got an engineering degree.
Right now, he's partying.

278
00:31:30,615 --> 00:31:32,651
We don't know
if he works with his father.

279
00:31:33,215 --> 00:31:37,527
Last night, Aladdin asked Marina
to testify in his favor.

280
00:31:37,695 --> 00:31:39,651
He's pressing charges
against Shapur.

281
00:31:39,815 --> 00:31:42,204
The police, a court of law...

282
00:31:42,615 --> 00:31:45,846
Testifying against the son
of a government advisor...

283
00:31:46,015 --> 00:31:48,006
She'll lose Aladdin if she doesn't.

284
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:50,651
She'll be exposed if she does.

285
00:31:51,215 --> 00:31:53,410
The police might sniff around.

286
00:31:53,855 --> 00:31:55,846
Maybe, on the father's orders.

287
00:31:59,415 --> 00:32:00,894
Remind her of the options:

288
00:32:01,055 --> 00:32:02,852
Either she risks exposure

289
00:32:03,415 --> 00:32:04,848
or she loses a good target.

290
00:32:05,975 --> 00:32:07,886
She's in the field,
she's capable...

291
00:32:08,055 --> 00:32:09,204
She knows best.

292
00:32:10,535 --> 00:32:11,729
She knows.

293
00:32:23,855 --> 00:32:25,447
We're going to the same place.

294
00:32:32,255 --> 00:32:34,291
How's it going with Dr. Balmes?

295
00:32:34,895 --> 00:32:36,123
Very well.

296
00:32:36,895 --> 00:32:38,487
Does she just go...

297
00:32:40,055 --> 00:32:42,011
Or does she guide you a bit?

298
00:32:42,815 --> 00:32:44,965
It's a shrink session,
not an afternoon delight.

299
00:32:45,655 --> 00:32:47,771
- You won't tell me anyway.
- Nope.

300
00:33:27,375 --> 00:33:28,603
You knew, didn't you?

301
00:33:29,295 --> 00:33:30,489
Could you tell?

302
00:33:30,655 --> 00:33:31,690
I could.

303
00:33:34,135 --> 00:33:36,330
No one knows how to keep a secret.

304
00:33:36,495 --> 00:33:39,771
I got 2 emails inviting me
to my surprise party.

305
00:33:39,935 --> 00:33:41,209
Not one. Two!

306
00:33:46,375 --> 00:33:48,206
You still think about her?

307
00:33:51,895 --> 00:33:53,010
Maybe.

308
00:33:54,175 --> 00:33:55,528
You have any news?

309
00:33:56,375 --> 00:33:57,649
How would I?

310
00:33:59,135 --> 00:34:00,284
Do you miss her?

311
00:34:01,375 --> 00:34:02,649
Enough.

312
00:34:18,575 --> 00:34:19,451
Cheers!

313
00:34:56,775 --> 00:34:58,413
- You leaving?
- No, why?

314
00:34:59,335 --> 00:35:01,451
The Syrian desk left their cake.

315
00:35:01,615 --> 00:35:03,492
The executioner's been ID'd.

316
00:35:03,655 --> 00:35:05,964
Bouzama... Boumaza... Toufik.

317
00:35:06,775 --> 00:35:08,288
I don't know why, but...

318
00:35:09,855 --> 00:35:11,732
Sounds familiar, right?

319
00:36:04,055 --> 00:36:05,886
- Yes?
- <i>I need you.</i>

320
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:08,446
I've already left. I'm in a cab...

321
00:36:08,935 --> 00:36:10,004
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

322
00:36:11,455 --> 00:36:14,413
<i>Raymond, forget the girl.</i>
<i>Leave her and get over here.</i>

323
00:36:14,575 --> 00:36:15,530
OK.

324
00:36:16,975 --> 00:36:19,250
- I have to go back.
- To the party?

325
00:36:19,855 --> 00:36:22,005
- To the office.
- You do?

326
00:36:23,615 --> 00:36:24,843
I'm sorry.

327
00:36:25,455 --> 00:36:27,093
When can we get together?

328
00:36:27,255 --> 00:36:28,847
I can wait at your place.

329
00:36:29,495 --> 00:36:31,645
Or you can stop by afterwards.

330
00:36:31,935 --> 00:36:33,573
I have a girlfriend.

331
00:36:34,255 --> 00:36:35,654
I can't.

332
00:36:40,095 --> 00:36:43,371
Bouzama? Boumaza?
Ring a bell?

333
00:36:44,215 --> 00:36:47,013
No.
Are you sure it's related to Cyclone?

334
00:36:47,175 --> 00:36:48,164
It's a feeling.

335
00:36:48,735 --> 00:36:51,647
But I re-read his report.
The name doesn't come up.

336
00:36:54,655 --> 00:36:57,044
Boumaza... Bouzama?

337
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:59,854
I don't know...
I've had a bit to drink.

338
00:37:00,015 --> 00:37:03,564
It must be hiding in some report.
A tiny little detail.

339
00:37:04,935 --> 00:37:07,051
Pull up all the Skype calls,

340
00:37:07,215 --> 00:37:08,807
everything from Algeria.

341
00:37:09,055 --> 00:37:10,852
Find me that name.

342
00:37:11,015 --> 00:37:11,811
OK.

343
00:37:15,575 --> 00:37:16,564
Now.

344
00:37:18,455 --> 00:37:21,652
It's no big deal.
I could tell she was a clingy one.

345
00:37:21,815 --> 00:37:23,089
Sorry.

346
00:37:39,055 --> 00:37:40,568
<i>You have a girlfriend?</i>

347
00:37:56,655 --> 00:37:57,451
Come.

348
00:38:04,375 --> 00:38:07,014
<i>I met two brothers at Laila's wedding.</i>

349
00:38:07,175 --> 00:38:08,494
<i>They were French.</i>

350
00:38:08,935 --> 00:38:10,846
<i>The Boumaza brothers,</i>
<i>from the north of Paris.</i>

351
00:38:11,015 --> 00:38:12,607
<i>Cousins of the groom.</i>

352
00:38:15,095 --> 00:38:19,008
<i>I talked to Yacim, the younger one,</i>
<i>in Algeria for the first time.</i>

353
00:38:21,295 --> 00:38:22,171
Stop staring!

354
00:38:27,095 --> 00:38:28,687
You want to get married?

355
00:38:29,815 --> 00:38:31,134
I'm 15...

356
00:38:33,295 --> 00:38:34,125
With her?

357
00:38:36,015 --> 00:38:38,290
I'm sure she's already married.

358
00:38:44,535 --> 00:38:46,048
Go help with the presents.

359
00:38:53,535 --> 00:38:55,366
<i>Then, with the older one.</i>

360
00:38:55,535 --> 00:38:57,093
<i>Toufik Boumaza.</i>

361
00:38:57,535 --> 00:38:58,854
<i>He was not talkative,</i>

362
00:38:59,015 --> 00:39:00,084
<i>cautious...</i>

363
00:39:01,455 --> 00:39:05,050
<i>I sensed that he wasn't in Algiers</i>
<i>only for the wedding.</i>

364
00:39:05,655 --> 00:39:07,930
<i>I didn't insist,</i>
<i>not to raise his suspicions.</i>

365
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:10,893
<i>But I think he was there to meet people.</i>

366
00:39:42,135 --> 00:39:43,124
Shit...

367
00:39:43,775 --> 00:39:45,891
Cyclone shook his hand.

368
00:39:48,095 --> 00:39:50,529
We must use Cyclone.
He knows the brothers.

369
00:39:50,695 --> 00:39:54,404
- But is he reliable?
- We know he's not!

370
00:39:54,575 --> 00:39:56,247
But we have no choice.

371
00:39:59,615 --> 00:40:01,128
He's our quickest option.

372
00:40:01,295 --> 00:40:04,526
It's a mistake.
He failed once and will fail again.

373
00:40:04,975 --> 00:40:06,772
Cyclone, I mean...

374
00:40:11,495 --> 00:40:14,965
Come with me to meet some CIA guy
named Cassidy.

375
00:40:15,135 --> 00:40:17,171
A surprise visit, right now.

376
00:40:19,055 --> 00:40:22,172
- Why do you want me?
- Because he asked for you.

377
00:40:58,895 --> 00:41:01,773
Hello, I'm Peter Cassidy.

378
00:41:01,935 --> 00:41:03,368
Good evening.

379
00:41:03,535 --> 00:41:05,446
Guillaume Debailly, my deputy.

380
00:41:05,615 --> 00:41:06,491
How are you?

381
00:41:06,655 --> 00:41:07,849
Pleased to meet you.

382
00:41:22,615 --> 00:41:26,528
You probably wonder why
I asked for an appointment so urgently.

383
00:41:26,695 --> 00:41:27,730
Right.

384
00:41:29,095 --> 00:41:31,086
Now, we have a new policy.

385
00:41:33,295 --> 00:41:35,525
We want to be in total confidence

386
00:41:35,695 --> 00:41:38,573
with our allies and historical partners.

387
00:41:39,975 --> 00:41:41,647
Since the Bonn incident,

388
00:41:42,095 --> 00:41:45,212
we no longer want anyone to suspect us

389
00:41:45,375 --> 00:41:47,889
of spying on our pals.

390
00:41:48,295 --> 00:41:49,523
Wonderful.

391
00:41:51,335 --> 00:41:54,486
We no longer recruit within our allies.

392
00:41:55,855 --> 00:41:58,494
And you no longer wire-tap them?

393
00:42:00,175 --> 00:42:03,804
You can't expect us to cut our ears off,
now can you?

394
00:42:03,975 --> 00:42:05,613
That's what I thought.

395
00:42:07,655 --> 00:42:09,452
Do you have any idea

396
00:42:09,615 --> 00:42:12,004
how many guys come to us

397
00:42:12,535 --> 00:42:14,685
with a proposal?

398
00:42:14,855 --> 00:42:16,891
I mean, allied guys.

399
00:42:17,055 --> 00:42:18,408
No, I don't.

400
00:42:19,135 --> 00:42:21,569
17 a day.

401
00:42:22,255 --> 00:42:23,608
17.

402
00:42:24,215 --> 00:42:26,012
Does 17

403
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:28,928
include mythomaniac candidates?

404
00:42:29,095 --> 00:42:30,574
Of course not.

405
00:42:31,975 --> 00:42:33,647
That's quite a number.

406
00:42:33,815 --> 00:42:36,010
We wish we could say the same.

407
00:42:37,735 --> 00:42:40,169
Our new policy is this:

408
00:42:40,375 --> 00:42:43,014
When they come to us with a proposal,

409
00:42:43,375 --> 00:42:45,605
we immediately reject it.

410
00:42:45,775 --> 00:42:48,687
And then we tell our allies.

411
00:42:49,015 --> 00:42:52,052
That is in fact why I am here today.

412
00:42:52,895 --> 00:42:56,092
To tell you that
we recently received a proposal.

413
00:42:56,735 --> 00:42:59,727
A very serious proposal.

414
00:43:03,895 --> 00:43:06,693
I have to check with
the Intelligence Director.

415
00:43:06,975 --> 00:43:08,010
No...

416
00:43:08,575 --> 00:43:11,169
in your service, Henri.

417
00:43:15,055 --> 00:43:17,489
Have you come to give me
this person's name?

418
00:43:19,255 --> 00:43:20,244
Exactly.

419
00:43:21,735 --> 00:43:23,327
Could you write it down?

420
00:43:24,095 --> 00:43:26,325
That's what I was about to do.

421
00:43:50,095 --> 00:43:51,767
Would you like to intervene?

422
00:43:55,335 --> 00:43:57,326
I can't wait to know that name.

423
00:43:58,375 --> 00:43:59,330
Alright.

424
00:44:11,495 --> 00:44:14,885
What would you say
is the level of certainty on this?

425
00:44:16,575 --> 00:44:18,293
100%.

426
00:44:20,775 --> 00:44:21,844
Very well.

427
00:44:22,695 --> 00:44:25,050
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Mr. Cassidy.

428
00:44:25,575 --> 00:44:27,167
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

429
00:44:51,175 --> 00:44:52,847
- I don't know him.
- Me neither.

430
00:44:54,375 --> 00:44:57,094
I said nothing.
Neither confirmed nor denied.

431
00:44:57,255 --> 00:45:00,327
I'll keep looking,
but it must be a con.

432
00:45:01,415 --> 00:45:02,928
What's his goal?

433
00:45:03,095 --> 00:45:04,448
It's a test.

434
00:45:04,855 --> 00:45:08,052
I think I know what he's after.
They have a mole here.

435
00:45:08,975 --> 00:45:12,650
He wants to know if we know,
and what we'd do if we did...

436
00:45:12,815 --> 00:45:16,649
We've learned one thing:
They don't know that we know.

437
00:45:17,215 --> 00:45:18,409
That we know what?

438
00:45:20,015 --> 00:45:23,212
During Cyclone's captivity,
there were leaks on Felis.

439
00:45:23,935 --> 00:45:25,766
We know...

440
00:45:26,335 --> 00:45:27,484
and we're watching.

441
00:45:27,655 --> 00:45:29,168
Watching who?

442
00:45:29,335 --> 00:45:30,529
Everyone.

443
00:45:59,135 --> 00:46:00,011
How are you?

444
00:46:01,015 --> 00:46:04,087
- I'm bothering you at work...
- No, you're not.

445
00:46:04,335 --> 00:46:05,688
Did you think about it?

446
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:09,725
I'm sorry. You're French.
I know it's complicated for you.

447
00:46:10,775 --> 00:46:12,174
Sit down.

448
00:46:20,255 --> 00:46:21,529
- Hello.
- Hi.

449
00:46:21,775 --> 00:46:22,844
See you later.

450
00:46:27,935 --> 00:46:29,926
Everyone is backing out.

451
00:46:30,095 --> 00:46:31,813
I'm on my own.

452
00:46:32,655 --> 00:46:33,724
I need a witness.

453
00:46:33,895 --> 00:46:35,044
I understand.

454
00:46:35,215 --> 00:46:36,773
I want compensation.

455
00:46:37,655 --> 00:46:38,974
How does it work?

456
00:46:39,535 --> 00:46:43,323
Shapur's father hears us out.
If he believes I've been assaulted,

457
00:46:43,495 --> 00:46:46,612
his son will have to pay and apologize.

458
00:46:47,135 --> 00:46:48,853
It's on Saturday.

459
00:46:49,975 --> 00:46:50,851
OK.

460
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:53,564
I'll be your witness.

461
00:47:02,815 --> 00:47:03,850
He's here.

462
00:47:09,295 --> 00:47:10,933
The whole bottle!

463
00:47:12,095 --> 00:47:15,849
Until you feel so sick
you'd rather be dead.

464
00:47:19,695 --> 00:47:22,607
They want to give you a mission.
I'm against it.

465
00:47:22,935 --> 00:47:24,334
Prove me wrong.

466
00:48:18,255 --> 00:48:19,688
- Good evening.
- Hello.

467
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:21,004
This is for you.

468
00:48:22,495 --> 00:48:25,089
You weren't home
so they left it with me.

469
00:48:26,095 --> 00:48:27,847
- Thanks.
- Good evening.

470
00:48:58,775 --> 00:49:00,493
<i>Possibility</i>

471
00:49:10,815 --> 00:49:12,043
<i>New</i>

472
00:49:15,095 --> 00:49:16,813
<i>Contract</i>

473
00:49:18,735 --> 00:49:22,444
<i>Sending the book was a mistake.</i>
<i>It's easy to find out I didn't order it.</i>

474
00:49:22,855 --> 00:49:24,607
But you did order it...

475
00:49:24,855 --> 00:49:26,732
Check your account.

476
00:49:30,015 --> 00:49:32,768
We're inquiring into
possible leaks to the CIA.

477
00:49:33,375 --> 00:49:36,765
Your friend Cassidy
foolishly confirmed our suspicions.

478
00:49:37,695 --> 00:49:40,687
What's it to you?
I thought you didn't care anymore.

479
00:49:41,975 --> 00:49:43,488
I'm concerned about you.

480
00:49:48,855 --> 00:49:51,210
Do you know more on this inquiry?

481
00:49:51,375 --> 00:49:52,330
No.

482
00:49:52,815 --> 00:49:54,453
Don't worry about me.

483
00:49:56,655 --> 00:49:57,770
What's this new contract?

484
00:49:58,095 --> 00:50:00,131
There was nothing left to do.

485
00:50:01,975 --> 00:50:04,330
Now that Nadia El-Mansour is in Syria,

486
00:50:04,855 --> 00:50:07,733
we can discuss her release
with the Syrians,

487
00:50:08,295 --> 00:50:10,809
but not without
the State Department's OK.

488
00:50:11,535 --> 00:50:15,414
We have to offer something valuable,
to get them to agree.

489
00:50:17,055 --> 00:50:17,851
Like what?

490
00:50:18,655 --> 00:50:20,134
You figure it out.

491
00:50:21,535 --> 00:50:25,414
The State Department must feel
it's worthwhile to talk to them.

492
00:50:26,735 --> 00:50:29,966
Can you come up
with something that valuable?

493
00:50:59,975 --> 00:51:01,328
If my son

494
00:51:01,495 --> 00:51:04,248
made a mistake,
I can try to repair it.

495
00:51:04,735 --> 00:51:06,487
Whatever the cost.

496
00:51:07,535 --> 00:51:10,333
Consider yourself here
in the house of Justice.

497
00:51:10,575 --> 00:51:13,248
Now, tell me the facts.

498
00:51:14,295 --> 00:51:16,172
Shapur went crazy

499
00:51:16,335 --> 00:51:18,326
and beat me up for no reason!

500
00:51:18,535 --> 00:51:22,005
He accused me of being disrespectful
to this young woman...

501
00:51:22,175 --> 00:51:25,247
I didn't like the way
he was looking at Daria.

502
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:26,768
I asked him to stop.

503
00:51:27,175 --> 00:51:29,928
He got angry and tried to hit me.
I wanted to...

504
00:51:30,095 --> 00:51:31,608
That's a lie!

505
00:51:31,935 --> 00:51:35,245
I asked your friend
to tell me what happened.

506
00:51:35,415 --> 00:51:37,645
You'll talk when it's your turn!

507
00:51:38,495 --> 00:51:40,531
Is that so hard to understand?

508
00:51:44,695 --> 00:51:45,844
Daria.

509
00:51:47,015 --> 00:51:48,494
I've known you for years.

510
00:51:49,495 --> 00:51:50,325
Tell me...

511
00:51:50,935 --> 00:51:52,653
Was Asan disrespectful to you?

512
00:51:55,375 --> 00:51:56,410
Yes, I think so.

513
00:51:57,295 --> 00:51:58,614
You ''think'' so?

514
00:52:00,775 --> 00:52:01,810
Miss Loiseau.

515
00:52:02,775 --> 00:52:06,165
I think you will be able
to shed light on this.

516
00:52:06,695 --> 00:52:08,731
Please tell us what happened.

517
00:52:13,175 --> 00:52:15,735
I will use simple words,

518
00:52:15,895 --> 00:52:17,931
because my Farsi isn't very good.

519
00:52:20,255 --> 00:52:24,214
I must say that I was shocked
by the violence of the blows

520
00:52:24,535 --> 00:52:27,095
your son inflicted on my friend Asan

521
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:29,208
for no reason.

522
00:52:30,135 --> 00:52:32,490
They were blows, not words.

523
00:53:16,855 --> 00:53:18,971
What made you go work for them?

524
00:53:20,975 --> 00:53:23,443
My husband's death, in New York,

525
00:53:23,615 --> 00:53:24,934
on September 11.

526
00:53:25,575 --> 00:53:27,008
In one of the planes.

527
00:53:29,335 --> 00:53:30,734
Why not the DGSE?

528
00:53:33,215 --> 00:53:35,570
The DGSE didn't offer.

529
00:53:36,695 --> 00:53:39,846
And I felt closer to the Americans,
at the time.

530
00:53:49,415 --> 00:53:51,565
I could give you a source in Iran.

531
00:53:53,415 --> 00:53:56,771
The U.S. Have no one in Iran.
Who would handle that source?

532
00:53:58,375 --> 00:54:00,366
We would.
But I'd share.

533
00:54:02,415 --> 00:54:03,484
Who is it?

534
00:54:05,975 --> 00:54:09,490
The government's special advisor
on nuclear affairs...

535
00:54:10,935 --> 00:54:14,245
When Areva and GE
fight to build nuclear plants,

536
00:54:15,095 --> 00:54:17,131
he'll be able to inform you.

537
00:54:18,375 --> 00:54:20,889
You can recruit
such an important official?

538
00:54:21,095 --> 00:54:23,404
Not him... his son.

539
00:54:25,615 --> 00:54:27,765
One of our agents is close to him.

540
00:54:30,895 --> 00:54:32,692
Which one?

541
00:54:35,215 --> 00:54:36,887
Marina Loiseau.

542
00:54:41,815 --> 00:54:42,930
I'll see.

543
00:54:56,455 --> 00:54:58,969
<i>If they say I'm a traitor,</i>
<i>it's the truth.</i>

544
00:55:01,655 --> 00:55:03,486
<i>I betrayed my country.</i>

545
00:55:04,375 --> 00:55:05,933
<i>I lied to my friends.</i>

546
00:55:06,535 --> 00:55:08,093
<i>I fooled my colleagues.</i>

547
00:55:09,175 --> 00:55:11,131
<i>And I sacrificed good people.</i>

548
00:55:15,255 --> 00:55:17,371
<i>For this, I expect no sympathy.</i>

549
00:55:19,055 --> 00:55:20,613
<i>No forgiveness.</i>

550
00:55:22,015 --> 00:55:23,653
<i>I deserve my fate.</i>

551
00:55:31,695 --> 00:55:33,333
<i>If I had to do it again...</i>

552
00:55:35,655 --> 00:55:37,168
<i>I wouldn't hesitate.</i>

553
00:55:38,375 --> 00:55:40,650
