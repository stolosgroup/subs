[person] <i>We've all
heard that thing</i>

3
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:25,502
<i>about the butterfly flapping
its wings in Africa,</i>

4
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:29,006
<i>and months later there's
a hurricane in Miami.</i>

5
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,409
<i>Well, if you
haven't, look it up.</i>

6
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:35,679
<i>It means things you don't think
are connected actually are.</i>

7
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:47,816
<i>I never knew this girl.</i>

8
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:51,403
<i>Never met her.</i>

9
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:57,993
<i>This is the life she knew.</i>

10
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:16,428
[Mr. Brownstone playing]

11
00:02:16,512 --> 00:02:18,847
<i>And this is the life I knew.</i>

12
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,398
[friend 1] There I
am. There's the kid.

13
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:30,442
[friend 2] Did you just
call yourself "the kid"?

14
00:02:30,526 --> 00:02:33,529
Wait, isn't this the game you
fumbled three times in one quarter?

15
00:02:34,238 --> 00:02:36,907
This is also the game where
I did this, motherfucker.

16
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:40,702
[person] <i>You wouldn't think
so, but it is all connected.</i>

17
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:44,164
<i>These knuckleheads.
That girl on the bike.</i>

18
00:02:44,248 --> 00:02:47,584
Wait. Wait, who's that
streaking down the sideline?

19
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:49,711
Kankakee's favorite son.

20
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:51,672
[person] <i>Me, with my
million-dollar smile.</i>

21

[friend 2] Owner of grad school
records that still stand.

22
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:57,427
[friend 3] Given not one, not two,
but three fucking scholarship offers.

23
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:58,929
Hey, it was four, actually.

24
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:04,268
Christ, Jimmy, you
really were something.

25
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:09,022
[friend 1] What about me?

26
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:10,858
Well, he made even
you look good.

27
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:13,610
[friend 2] Pride
and joy of Kankakee.

28
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,532
- See?
- [Jimmy] Okay.

29
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:21,034
Try not to burn the place down,

30
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:22,744
and remember to
lock up this time.

31
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:24,496
- Yeah.
- Wait, what's with the pillow?

32
00:03:26,582 --> 00:03:27,791
Anybody heard from Danny?

33
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:34,466
[friend 1] Here's the real
play. Watch this shit.

34
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:36,008
Right here. Oh, right there.

35
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:37,843
[friend 2] You fucking
has-been pretty boy.

36
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:39,094
[sighs]

37
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,280
[Jimmy] <i>You know those times where you
think something's gonna go one way,</i>

38
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:00,324

39
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:05,120
<i>If I had to pick the moment,</i>

40
00:04:06,205 --> 00:04:08,498
<i>here's where it all started
to go sideways for me.</i>

41
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:13,837
<i>Like, for fucking ever.</i>

42
00:04:29,645 --> 00:04:30,646
Hiya, Jimmy.

43
00:04:31,522 --> 00:04:32,981
- Hi, Rog.
- Hop in.

44
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:34,816
What's with the pillow?

45
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,237
Well, last time I saw you, you said
you kept getting cricks in your neck.

46
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,321
I used to get 'em too.

47
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:40,822
Discovered this pillow.

48
00:04:40,906 --> 00:04:42,407
Never got 'em again.

49
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:47,246
You are the most profoundly
considerate motherfucker I've ever met.

50
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,164
I thank you, my good man.

51
00:04:49,248 --> 00:04:50,457
Put it in the back.

52
00:04:57,548 --> 00:04:58,590
[Rog chuckles]

53
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:04,346
What's with the orange shotgun?

54
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,348
I got a shipment of bean bags.

55
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:09,142
You know the kind cops
fire at riots and shit?

56
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:10,936
They trick the guns
out with weird colors

57
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:13,730
so they don't load live
rounds during protests,

58
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:14,857
kill some poor fucker

59
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:18,318
who's just asking to be treated
like a human being. [chuckles]

60
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:23,031
So appreciative you came in person
to deal with this. That it...

61
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,826
Touches me in a deep place.

62
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:29,204
I'm so sorry about
that last shipment.

63
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:31,039
Mistakes happen.

64
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:34,334
Not a whole kilo, man. I've...

65
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:37,379
- [tires screech]
- It's fucking embarrassing.

66
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:39,214
I mean, I've never
been light before.

67
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:43,635
Not so much as a gram
with anyone, ever.

68
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,388
Why would I claim I got shorted?

69
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:48,891
Hard to know a man's heart.

70
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:55,189
Come on now.

71
00:06:10,329 --> 00:06:12,831
How did you know the
shortage was on my end?

72
00:06:12,915 --> 00:06:16,293
I know because my guy told
me. And I trust my guy, Danny.

73
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:19,171
And why do you trust Danny, man?

74
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:20,589
We grew up together.

75
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:23,550
Hmm. That's adorable.

76
00:06:27,346 --> 00:06:28,514
[coughs]

77
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:32,726
[Danny sobbing] Jimmy.
I... I'm sorry, Jim.

78
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:36,146
- Danny.
- Jimmy, I'm so sorry.

79
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,397
What did you do?

80
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:38,607
[whimpering]

81
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:39,858
[Rog] Tell him.

82
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:43,487
- Tell him.
- [Danny sniffles, groans]

83
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:47,324
I stole your key, man.

84
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:50,494
I needed to get right
with Bern's people. [sobs]

85
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:52,204
We knew it wasn't us.

86
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:54,748
I had no idea.

87
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,416
He told me that.

88
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,252
No, Rog, no!

89
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:00,587
Oh. Okay.

90
00:07:00,671 --> 00:07:04,466
- Bean bag.
- Okay, he clipped the key.

91
00:07:05,384 --> 00:07:07,636
Okay? Here's a key.

92
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:09,555
[Danny coughing]

93
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:12,766
- [Danny sobs]
- A... And a second.

94
00:07:14,226 --> 00:07:15,811
For your trouble.

95
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:19,022
[Danny whimpering]

96
00:07:19,523 --> 00:07:20,524
[Danny gasps] No, no!

97
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:25,404
- Fuck, man! Oh! Okay. Okay.
- [Danny sobbing]

98
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:27,114
Not a bean bag.

99
00:07:27,698 --> 00:07:29,700
And a third for our friendship.

100
00:07:33,537 --> 00:07:35,289
You know, this isn't
just about the money.

101
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:38,083
Oh, come on. Nothing's just
about money, but they mostly are.

102
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:41,170
He stole from me.

103
00:07:41,253 --> 00:07:44,173
No, he stole from me.
I'd already paid you.

104
00:07:44,256 --> 00:07:47,509
I came here today to be compensated if
there had been some kind of mistake,

105
00:07:47,593 --> 00:07:48,719
but there wasn't.

106
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:51,054
Just this asshole
stealing from me.

107
00:07:51,847 --> 00:07:53,849
- But blaming me.
- No, I never blamed you.

108
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:55,517
- I didn't...
- Shut the fuck up!

109
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:57,394
[exhales sharply]

110
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:02,983
Rog. This guy, I've known him since
first grade. He's like family.

111
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:05,044
Be like if you were asked
to give up your own brother.

112
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:06,403
No matter what, could you do it?

113
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:07,988
You still have half the bag.

114
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:10,115
My family would be
worth the whole bag.

115
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:14,578
[whimpering]

116
00:08:17,873 --> 00:08:20,125
I think we come from
different types of family.

117
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:23,587
So, you're saying his life
is only worth three kilos?

118
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:26,465
[groans] His life is worth
three times what you lost,

119
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:27,883
because you lost nothing!

120
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:29,593
He's only worth three kilos?

121
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:33,347
Yes! Okay, his life is only
worth three kilos to me!

122
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:35,974
[inhales deeply]

123
00:08:38,727 --> 00:08:39,937

[sobs]

125
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:49,279
All I ask of the people I do business
with is their authentic self.

126
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:53,158
[sighs] Nice to see you, Jimmy.

127
00:08:55,744 --> 00:09:00,791
You can use the cart to, uh, transport
that young rascal to the car.

128
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:04,962
[breathing shakily]

[siren wailing]

130
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:09,026
[server] Have you had a
look at the menu, sir?

131
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:15,574
Jesus. No. I'm sorry…

132
00:10:17,993 --> 00:10:18,994
Rochelle.

133
00:10:22,623 --> 00:10:24,416
Could I get a water, please?

134
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:26,877
And I'll have an answer for
you by the time you're back?

135
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,961
Of course, sir.

136
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:30,464
Jimmy.

137
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:33,592
Of course, Jimmy.

138
00:10:41,517 --> 00:10:44,895
- [Rochelle moaning]
- ["Don't Let Him Go" playing]

139
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:47,105
Yeah.

140
00:10:53,529 --> 00:10:56,114
[song continues on speakers]

[whirring stops]

Hands, motherfucker! Hands!

[chuckles] You
smiling now, bitch?

144
00:11:57,426 --> 00:11:59,094
[grunting]

145
00:12:01,013 --> 00:12:02,097
[laughs]

146

[groans]

147
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:08,020
Can I get up now, please?

148
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,897
You just lie there and take it.

149
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,315
[groans]

150
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:12,441
[agent 1] We're clear.

151
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:14,401
- [agent 2] Turn it off.

Damn, Jimbo. What you
get up to last night?

154
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:25,245
[Rochelle snoring]

155
00:12:28,332 --> 00:12:30,083
You even know her name?

156
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:31,251
[Jimmy] Rochelle.

157
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:34,546
Her last name?

158
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:48,393
Planning to shoot up
a local middle school?

159
00:12:48,477 --> 00:12:49,728
[agent 1] That's federal.

160
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:52,523
Oh! Oh! [chuckles]

161
00:12:56,068 --> 00:12:57,402
Fuck is this, Jimbo?

162
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,656
- Jimmy. It's an AK-47.
- [FBI agent] Hmm.

163
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,200
It's a "no possibility
of reduced sentence."

164
00:13:03,784 --> 00:13:04,993
I got great lawyers.

165
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:10,666
They turn water into wine?

166
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:12,751
[scoffs]

167
00:13:13,836 --> 00:13:15,546
[door mechanism rattling]

168
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:16,630
[door slams]

169
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:22,719
[guard 1] Hey!
You got a visitor.

170
00:13:23,512 --> 00:13:26,014
[prisoners chattering]

171
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:31,228
[guard 2] Window one!

172
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:32,896
They tried that last time…

173
00:13:33,897 --> 00:13:36,233
[guard 2] Keene.
Next up, window two.

174
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:42,906
[prisoner chatters]

175
00:13:51,915 --> 00:13:53,184
[guard 2] Window
three, you're up.

176
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:54,293
You okay?

177
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:57,838
Did your mother
come visit you yet?

178
00:13:57,921 --> 00:14:01,216
She's still pissed I got Tim mixed up
in that thing a while back. [sighs]

179
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:05,137
Well… at least your
brother's gonna walk.

180
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:08,682
I'm not?

181
00:14:09,183 --> 00:14:11,226
I talked to some of the guys.

182
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:16,273
They said the prosecutor, Beaumont,
he's trying to prove something with you.

183
00:14:17,566 --> 00:14:18,567
Prove what?

184
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,777
That he's not part
of the machine.

185
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:22,738
I'm not part of the machine.

186
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,073
I was.

187
00:14:26,283 --> 00:14:27,618
My family.

188
00:14:28,285 --> 00:14:30,204
Your mother's family.

189
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:33,457
Tell me there's a
way out of this.

190
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,708
Not a quick one.

191
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,919
- [sighs]
- [guard 2] Window four, that's it.

192
00:14:37,002 --> 00:14:38,754
[Jimmy's dad] You'll
get five years.

193
00:14:39,338 --> 00:14:40,380
Five...

194
00:14:41,048 --> 00:14:42,799
Four with good behavior.

195
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:45,928
The low end of the
sentencing guidelines is

196
00:14:46,011 --> 00:14:49,348
if you take the plea,
you get two years.

197
00:14:50,432 --> 00:14:52,518
They're not gonna
give you two years.

198
00:14:53,936 --> 00:14:55,229
Why not?

199
00:14:55,312 --> 00:14:56,355
The guns.

200
00:14:57,064 --> 00:15:02,528
You're not some homey who's running around
capping grandmothers, doing a drive-by.

201
00:15:02,611 --> 00:15:04,112
You didn't sell crack, right?

202
00:15:04,196 --> 00:15:07,074
You're a good kid who
strayed off the path.

203
00:15:08,283 --> 00:15:10,536
You'll have to do the midrange.

204
00:15:12,037 --> 00:15:13,205
How do you know?

205
00:15:13,288 --> 00:15:14,289
[sighs]

206
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:17,376
I was a cop for 23 years.

207
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:21,964
And I asked around, and they
all said the same thing.

208
00:15:22,047 --> 00:15:24,383
Midrange of the guidelines.

209
00:15:25,092 --> 00:15:26,260
Five.

210
00:15:26,343 --> 00:15:27,427
Out in four.

211
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:29,721
I, um…

212
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:33,433
I never wanted this for you.

213
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:38,522
I wanted a totally
different deal.

214
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:42,484
Like what?

215
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:44,444
Like I said.

216
00:15:44,528 --> 00:15:45,529
No.

217
00:15:46,071 --> 00:15:47,072
What?

218
00:15:47,573 --> 00:15:51,285
For you to have,

219
00:15:51,368 --> 00:15:52,369
you know…

220
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:53,579
No, I don't.

221
00:15:55,497 --> 00:15:57,875
A wife. Kids.

222
00:15:58,584 --> 00:16:01,628
A fucking dog to
play Frisbee with.

223
00:16:01,712 --> 00:16:04,006
And a steady paycheck.

224
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,175
Pension at the end.

225
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:08,760
I do...

226
00:16:10,137 --> 00:16:11,305
I couldn't have…

227
00:16:12,681 --> 00:16:13,724
What?

228
00:16:14,433 --> 00:16:16,435
[breathes shakily] …helped you…

229
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:18,270
if I lived that life.

230
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:24,902
I still wanted it for you.

231
00:16:32,201 --> 00:16:34,161
I... I know. [breathes shakily]

232
00:16:35,204 --> 00:16:36,455
I know you did, Dad.

233
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:42,336
You just never
mentioned it before.

234
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:46,215
[guard 2] Four!
Window four, all done.

235
00:16:46,924 --> 00:16:52,221
T... Take the deal.
Okay? Plea out.

236
00:16:56,975 --> 00:16:59,603
[sighs]

237
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:05,025
Okay. In the case of the United
States versus James Keene…

238
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:08,487
Mr. Beaumont, am I to understand

239
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:11,698
that the defendant has entered into
a plea agreement with your office?

240
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:14,076
He has, Your Honor.

241
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:16,078
[judge] And Mr. Steinbeck,

242
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:19,080
is your client fully aware of
what he's pleading to today?

243
00:17:20,207 --> 00:17:21,208
He is, Your Honor.

244
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:24,711
[judge] Mr. Keene.

245
00:17:36,139 --> 00:17:37,641
Police officer's son, correct?

246
00:17:38,976 --> 00:17:40,227
Yes, sir.

247
00:17:41,019 --> 00:17:43,272
Star athlete at Kankakee High.

248
00:17:43,355 --> 00:17:46,441
I see you're quite generous
with a few local charities.

249
00:17:47,442 --> 00:17:51,113
But what you're pleading guilty to today
is the sale and trafficking of narcotics,

250
00:17:51,196 --> 00:17:53,657
the possession of paraphernalia
associated with the same,

251
00:17:54,241 --> 00:17:57,369
and possession of
multiple illegal firearms.

252
00:17:58,829 --> 00:18:01,456
So, how plead you?

253
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:03,876
Guilty.

254
00:18:04,793 --> 00:18:07,713
The sheer amount of narcotics
that you trafficked in, Mr. Keene,

255
00:18:07,796 --> 00:18:11,175
is enough to push your
sentence to 25 years.

256
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:14,553
Which you most certainly
would have gotten at minimum

257
00:18:14,636 --> 00:18:16,305
if your case had gone to trial.

258
00:18:16,889 --> 00:18:19,391
But you did the smart
thing today. You pled.

259
00:18:20,517 --> 00:18:22,686
Still, there are the
weapons, which one presumes

260
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:25,189
you were prepared to use
against other human beings

261
00:18:25,272 --> 00:18:26,940
to protect your narcotics.

262
00:18:28,567 --> 00:18:30,194
Therefore,

263
00:18:30,277 --> 00:18:33,030
it is the judgment of the court
the defendant be committed

264
00:18:33,113 --> 00:18:36,491
to the custody of the attorney
general of the United States,

265
00:18:36,575 --> 00:18:38,493
or her authorized
representative,

266
00:18:39,369 --> 00:18:42,664
for the minimum guideline
term of 120 months.

267
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,586
[judge] Bailiff.

268
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:50,839
Ten years?

269
00:18:50,923 --> 00:18:53,926
Ten fucking years?
Are you kidding me?

270
00:18:54,009 --> 00:18:56,929
You lied to me, Beaumont!
You fucking lied to me!

271
00:19:10,526 --> 00:19:14,530
[guard 1 announcing on PA]

272
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:20,577
You know what this is about?

273
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,043
[buzzer sounds]

274
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,680
[knocking]

275
00:19:47,479 --> 00:19:48,647
[guard 2] On or off?

276
00:19:49,314 --> 00:19:50,315
Off.

277
00:19:53,485 --> 00:19:55,153
[handcuffs clanking]

278
00:20:02,786 --> 00:20:04,580
I'm Special Agent
Lauren McCauley.

279
00:20:04,663 --> 00:20:06,456
You can call me that or Lauren.

280
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,834
I remember you
don't like "Jimbo."

281
00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:10,669
Jimmy, please.

282
00:20:12,004 --> 00:20:13,505
And you know Mr. Beaumont.

283
00:20:16,925 --> 00:20:20,512
Mr. Beaumont sandbagged me
into accepting a five-year plea

284
00:20:20,596 --> 00:20:22,514
when he knew I'd get ten.

285
00:20:22,598 --> 00:20:23,807
So you remember it?

286
00:20:24,474 --> 00:20:26,268
[Jimmy] No
possibility of parole.

287
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,353
Who takes that deal?

288
00:20:29,354 --> 00:20:31,273
You. [chuckles]

289
00:20:31,356 --> 00:20:32,566
You're a drug dealer.

290
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:35,986
And you played chicken
with us, and you lost.

291
00:20:37,446 --> 00:20:39,156
Embrace that concept.

292
00:20:39,781 --> 00:20:40,908
Now, sit down.

293
00:20:42,034 --> 00:20:43,202
[chuckles]

294
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:46,496
[Jimmy sighs]

295
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:51,627
I hear you're making
a real go of prison.

296
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:53,337
No major beefs.

297
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,631
Seem to get along with
most of the dominant gangs

298
00:20:55,714 --> 00:20:58,008
and successfully avoid the
ones you don't know yet.

299
00:20:58,091 --> 00:21:02,054
And… you've developed
a sideline in here?

300
00:21:02,137 --> 00:21:03,305
No shit.

301
00:21:04,306 --> 00:21:05,307
That's in there?

302
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:07,100
You use your profits to buy

303
00:21:08,769 --> 00:21:11,396
fresh vegetables and
lean cuts of meat?

304
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,523
Prison food sucks.

305
00:21:12,606 --> 00:21:14,149
So does prison life,

306
00:21:14,233 --> 00:21:16,443
but you seem to have
grabbed it by the balls.

307
00:21:17,653 --> 00:21:19,780
[sniffs] What is this
sideline, by the way?

308
00:21:22,491 --> 00:21:23,617
Just a service.

309
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,285
Oh, he's so modest.

310
00:21:25,369 --> 00:21:26,912
You rent porno mags, right?

311
00:21:27,538 --> 00:21:31,291
<i>Hustler. Penthouse.
Barely Legal.</i>

312
00:21:33,001 --> 00:21:34,086
How's that work?

313
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:37,464
They pay for half-hour blocks.

314
00:21:38,423 --> 00:21:41,260
Must be a lot of... What do they
call it in retail? Breakage?

315
00:21:41,969 --> 00:21:44,221
Hmm. I turn my
inventory over a lot.

316
00:21:44,304 --> 00:21:47,391
That's what you called
drugs too. Your "inventory."

317
00:21:47,933 --> 00:21:49,309
At least on the tapes I heard.

318
00:21:53,939 --> 00:21:55,941
I'm not surprised you're
thriving in here, Jimmy.

319
00:21:56,024 --> 00:21:57,067
I'm not thriving.

320
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:59,820
Because you're a charming
guy. Everyone likes you.

321
00:21:59,903 --> 00:22:02,239
I've heard you talk to
Mexican cartel guys,

322
00:22:02,322 --> 00:22:03,782
Cabrini-Green bangers,

323
00:22:03,866 --> 00:22:06,910
Outfit goombahs in their tracksuits
at the Elmwood Park Social Club.

324
00:22:06,994 --> 00:22:08,704
You get along with everyone.

325
00:22:10,205 --> 00:22:11,623
I've noticed something else.

326
00:22:11,707 --> 00:22:12,791
After a certain point,

327
00:22:13,876 --> 00:22:15,794
they do most of the talking.

328
00:22:17,629 --> 00:22:18,463
I'm sorry?

329
00:22:18,547 --> 00:22:20,316
You've got your patter,
your funny story or two,

330
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:23,468
but then you settle back and
just let them run their mouths.

331
00:22:23,552 --> 00:22:25,053
Take me.

332
00:22:25,137 --> 00:22:27,848
Something in those
soulful eyes of yours.

333
00:22:28,932 --> 00:22:32,019
The way you sit so still,
so at peace with yourself.

334
00:22:32,728 --> 00:22:36,190
It makes me want to
babble, man. Unlock myself.

335
00:22:36,273 --> 00:22:38,442
You mentioned a
point a while back?

336
00:22:38,525 --> 00:22:41,320
You in a rush? 'Cause we
can let you get back to it.

337
00:22:43,197 --> 00:22:44,656
No. I'm fine.

338
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:47,117
You got porn to sell,
veggies to procure,

339
00:22:47,201 --> 00:22:51,705
and only, hmm, nine years, three
months left on your sentence?

340
00:22:51,788 --> 00:22:54,082
- Just tell me what you want.
- I don't wanna hold you up.

341
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:55,792
Just fucking tell
me why I'm here.

342
00:22:58,128 --> 00:22:59,129
Temper.

343
00:23:00,923 --> 00:23:02,382
Not as cool as he thinks.

344
00:23:03,675 --> 00:23:04,718
[clears throat]

345
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:12,059
We would like you to
transfer to another prison

346
00:23:12,142 --> 00:23:14,853
and befriend someone
to elicit a confession.

347
00:23:16,396 --> 00:23:19,650
We need the precise
location of a dead body.

348
00:23:23,111 --> 00:23:24,530
You need it?

349
00:23:24,613 --> 00:23:27,741
We suspect that the man that
you'll read about in that file

350
00:23:27,824 --> 00:23:30,160
has killed 14 women, maybe more.

351
00:23:30,244 --> 00:23:34,373
But we only tied him to two. And
we only have one of the bodies.

352
00:23:34,456 --> 00:23:37,876
We'd like to find the other
one. And maybe 12 more.

353
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:44,091
And this prison
where the guy is?

354
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,262
It's in Springfield, Missouri.

355
00:23:49,179 --> 00:23:52,349
Maximum security, specializing
in the criminally insane.

356
00:23:52,432 --> 00:23:53,559
[chuckles]

357
00:23:56,645 --> 00:24:01,942
So… you want me to
check in to hell,

358
00:24:03,318 --> 00:24:05,153
cozy up to a fucking demon,

359
00:24:05,237 --> 00:24:10,742
and ask him all casual, "Hey,
so where'd you bury 13 bodies?"

360
00:24:12,452 --> 00:24:13,579
Is that right?

361
00:24:14,746 --> 00:24:16,331
[chuckles]

362
00:24:21,295 --> 00:24:24,381
Not for all the fucking
money in the world.

363
00:24:27,926 --> 00:24:29,178
How about freedom?

364
00:24:31,972 --> 00:24:35,058
A complete commutation
of your sentence.

365
00:24:40,981 --> 00:24:42,149
If I transfer?

366
00:24:43,483 --> 00:24:44,693
If you transfer.

367
00:24:46,111 --> 00:24:49,573
And if you get the location
of Patricia Reitler's body.

368
00:24:49,656 --> 00:24:51,491
No body, no release.

369
00:24:53,076 --> 00:24:55,787
No body, no release. [sighs]

370
00:25:03,962 --> 00:25:04,962
No.

371
00:25:06,423 --> 00:25:07,674
[Lauren] No?

372
00:25:07,758 --> 00:25:08,884
[Jimmy] No.

373
00:25:11,011 --> 00:25:14,515
[Lauren] His conviction's on
appeal. He could win and walk.

374
00:25:14,598 --> 00:25:20,437
If he walks, he'll kill again and again
until he fucks up and gets caught.

375
00:25:20,521 --> 00:25:23,732
The last time, he killed 14
girls before he got caught.

376
00:25:23,815 --> 00:25:25,984
And it won't have
anything to do with me.

377
00:25:26,068 --> 00:25:27,319
[Lauren] It will.

378
00:25:27,402 --> 00:25:30,239
You had the chance to stop
him, and you didn't take it.

379
00:25:30,322 --> 00:25:36,537
Look, I'm sorry about these
women, but I don't know them.

380
00:25:37,329 --> 00:25:39,390
And if he gets out, I won't
know the next ones he kills.

381
00:25:39,414 --> 00:25:41,041
I might be sad about it, but…

382
00:25:41,124 --> 00:25:43,252
This kind of deal won't
walk through the door twice.

383
00:25:43,335 --> 00:25:49,591
So, before you spend the next ten
years wondering why you didn't take it…

384
00:25:53,303 --> 00:25:54,555
look at the file.

385
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:05,023
At the very least, it'll
make unique reading material.

386
00:26:10,571 --> 00:26:12,155
Your attorney has
our contact info.

387
00:26:19,705 --> 00:26:21,290
[exhales deeply]

388
00:26:26,336 --> 00:26:27,379
[grunts]

389
00:26:52,863 --> 00:26:54,114
Come on, Brooke!

390
00:26:56,575 --> 00:26:58,452
[spectator] Come on, Brookie!

391
00:26:58,535 --> 00:27:00,787
- She hung onto it.
- Holy shit. She did!

392
00:27:00,871 --> 00:27:01,955
Okay, o...

393
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:04,267
- Honey, you're going the wrong direction!
- Honey, the other way!

394
00:27:04,291 --> 00:27:06,251
- Wrong direction!
- The other way!

395
00:27:07,544 --> 00:27:08,921
[whistle blows]

396
00:27:11,381 --> 00:27:13,300
Well, she runs pretty fast.

397
00:27:13,383 --> 00:27:16,220
[chuckles] Yeah. Not bad, right?

398
00:27:16,303 --> 00:27:18,263
[police radio chatter]

399
00:27:18,347 --> 00:27:20,307
Will he be home for dinner?

400
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:21,558
Not likely.

401
00:27:22,476 --> 00:27:23,852
We found Jessica Roach.

402
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:37,574
Line it up. Here
we go. First down.

403
00:27:51,213 --> 00:27:52,464
[sighs]

404
00:27:55,676 --> 00:27:57,386
[police radio chatter]

405
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:50,647
Over there. Yeah.

406
00:29:32,439 --> 00:29:33,857
[sighs]

407
00:30:08,183 --> 00:30:09,309
[sighs]

408
00:30:39,965 --> 00:30:41,842
He stepped out right about here.

409
00:30:42,342 --> 00:30:43,343
What did he look like?

410
00:30:43,927 --> 00:30:46,221
[witness] He was white.
That's about all I saw.

411
00:30:46,722 --> 00:30:50,142
Was he short? Tall?
Bald? Not bald?

412
00:30:50,225 --> 00:30:53,979
Uh… I didn't get a good look at him.
He hopped in a van and drove off.

413
00:30:54,605 --> 00:30:55,856
What color van?

414
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:00,068
It was like a gray or brown...

415
00:31:00,569 --> 00:31:02,863
It was night. It could have
been green too, or black.

416
00:31:03,572 --> 00:31:05,199
I know it was a Dodge, for sure.

417
00:31:06,909 --> 00:31:09,161
You don't know the color
of the van, but you know…

418
00:31:09,244 --> 00:31:11,622
I'm a mechanic. I know
a Dodge when I see one.

419
00:31:23,258 --> 00:31:25,978
[receptionist] Vermilion County
Sheriff's Department. Can I help you?

420
00:31:27,804 --> 00:31:29,306
He sure is. [speaks
indistinctly]

421
00:31:36,813 --> 00:31:39,525
[line ringing]

422
00:31:39,608 --> 00:31:44,321
Hey, Len. Uh, you filed a
report a couple of weeks ago

423
00:31:44,404 --> 00:31:47,241
on a possible 647
over at Whittier?

424
00:31:47,324 --> 00:31:50,494
Yep. Two 14-year-old
girls riding their bikes.

425
00:31:50,577 --> 00:31:52,955
Said this perv in a
van kept passing them.

426
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:54,706
<i>Told them he liked
their boobies.</i>

427
00:31:55,791 --> 00:31:57,626
- He said "boobies"?
- <i>Yep.</i>

428
00:31:57,709 --> 00:32:00,045
He also asked if they wanted
to take a ride with him.

429
00:32:00,128 --> 00:32:01,129
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

430
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:06,343
Yeah, well, they said the
van, uh, the van's gray?

431
00:32:06,426 --> 00:32:08,470
<i>Yep, they got a plate.</i>

432
00:32:08,554 --> 00:32:10,639
- They got what?
- Indiana plate number.

433
00:32:11,306 --> 00:32:13,392
Check the notes at
the end of the report.

434
00:32:14,142 --> 00:32:16,687
Okay. Uh, did you run it?

435
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:20,190
No. The guy drove off.
They never saw him again.

436
00:32:20,274 --> 00:32:22,651
And the girl struck me
as a little dramatic.

437
00:32:22,734 --> 00:32:24,069
<i>You know girls, man.</i>

438
00:32:24,152 --> 00:32:25,696
<i>But be my guest, Brian.</i>

439
00:32:25,779 --> 00:32:27,698
Okay. Thanks, Len.

440
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:30,951
Mmm.

441
00:32:32,995 --> 00:32:36,290
That van that followed
the two girls in Whittier,

442
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:39,501
it's been called in three
other times in the last year.

443
00:32:41,003 --> 00:32:45,757
Once in Indianola, once in Olivet,
once near the Dauphin Reserve.

444
00:32:45,841 --> 00:32:48,677
The same complaint
every time. Harassment.

445
00:32:50,679 --> 00:32:52,472
And said van is registered to...

446
00:32:52,556 --> 00:32:56,393
Larry D. Hall. Wabash, Indiana.

447
00:32:58,353 --> 00:33:00,939
[Jimmy's dad] Your sister told
me your mother actually visited.

448
00:33:01,023 --> 00:33:04,276
[Jimmy] She did. She's pissed you
brought your girlfriend to my sentencing.

449
00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:07,154
[Jimmy's dad] I've been with Sammy
longer than I was with your mother.

450
00:33:07,237 --> 00:33:09,323
She's pissed Sammy
makes me happy.

451
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:11,700
I just wish you liked her more.

452
00:33:11,783 --> 00:33:14,494
[Jimmy] Sam? I like her fine.
She just ain't my mother.

453
00:33:15,454 --> 00:33:16,622
[Jimmy's dad] Uh-huh.

454
00:33:22,669 --> 00:33:24,588
I've been thinking
about that deal.

455
00:33:24,671 --> 00:33:27,257
What? You think
this place is bad?

456
00:33:27,966 --> 00:33:31,345
Springfield is the kind of prison
that they send subhumans to.

457
00:33:31,428 --> 00:33:33,805
The fucking freaks
with no souls.

458
00:33:33,889 --> 00:33:35,766
Lifers with nothing to lose.

459
00:33:35,849 --> 00:33:38,143
They'll commute
my whole sentence.

460
00:33:38,227 --> 00:33:40,854
What happens if you don't
get them what they want?

461
00:33:41,563 --> 00:33:42,981
Then what?

462
00:33:43,065 --> 00:33:44,667
What happens if you
have to defend yourself,

463
00:33:44,691 --> 00:33:47,361
and they tack on another ten
fucking years to your sentence?

464
00:33:48,028 --> 00:33:49,863
That'd be a death sentence.

465
00:33:49,947 --> 00:33:52,157
We'll find a way. We'll
figure something out.

466
00:33:52,241 --> 00:33:53,951
- How?
- I don't know.

467
00:33:55,202 --> 00:33:56,745
But we're going to find a way.

468
00:34:29,069 --> 00:34:30,070
[intercom rings]

469
00:34:30,152 --> 00:34:32,114
[receptionist] <i>You've got
a call from Wabash PD.</i>

470
00:34:32,197 --> 00:34:35,449
Yeah? Put it through, please.

471
00:34:37,494 --> 00:34:40,289
Detective Miller?
Chris Drysdale.

472
00:34:40,371 --> 00:34:41,873
[Brian] <i>Hey, Chris.</i>

473
00:34:41,956 --> 00:34:44,668
Got a question about a... a van

474
00:34:44,751 --> 00:34:50,924
registered to a resident of
yours, a... a Lawrence D. Hall?

475
00:34:51,007 --> 00:34:52,467
<i>Sure. Larry.</i>

476
00:34:52,551 --> 00:34:53,552
You know him?

477
00:34:54,136 --> 00:34:56,013
I-I grew up with him. [sighs]

478
00:34:56,096 --> 00:34:57,556
<i>You know him well?</i>

479
00:34:57,639 --> 00:34:59,933
Uh, well enough.
It's a small town.

480
00:35:00,517 --> 00:35:02,352
<i>Uh, you looking at
him for something?</i>

481
00:35:02,436 --> 00:35:08,692
Well, we're just trying to figure
out why a... a van registered to him

482
00:35:10,277 --> 00:35:13,488
passed through our area a couple
of times in the last year.

483
00:35:13,572 --> 00:35:16,074
You're in, uh,
Illinois, the girl said.

484
00:35:16,158 --> 00:35:18,744
<i>Georgetown, about 130
miles down the road.</i>

485
00:35:19,453 --> 00:35:21,622
So, he wasn't picking
up a gallon of milk.

486
00:35:21,705 --> 00:35:22,831
Nope.

487
00:35:22,915 --> 00:35:24,791
<i>Or, uh, doing Civil War shit?</i>

488
00:35:25,375 --> 00:35:26,376
What's that?

489
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:32,216
Larry's into Civil War reenactments.
You know, they dress up in the uniforms.

490
00:35:32,299 --> 00:35:35,219
Larry has these funky muttonchop
sideburns, and they play at the battles.

491
00:35:35,302 --> 00:35:37,054
<i>They do it all over the place.</i>

492
00:35:37,137 --> 00:35:39,932
<i>You should check if they had any at
the times he was around your town.</i>

493
00:35:40,015 --> 00:35:41,475
<i>I bet that will explain it.</i>

494
00:35:42,351 --> 00:35:43,393
Okay.

495
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,230
Thank you, Chris.
I'll look into it.

496
00:35:46,313 --> 00:35:47,648
<i>Yeah, sure enough. Take care.</i>

497
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:49,980
[receptionist] <i>Vermilion
County Parks Department.</i>

498
00:37:50,062 --> 00:37:53,106
Hey, this is Brian Miller over
at the Sheriff's Department,

499
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:54,983
trying to ascertain
whether or not

500
00:37:55,651 --> 00:38:01,448
any Civil War reenactors have
filed for permits in the last year?

501
00:38:01,949 --> 00:38:04,952
<i>Ooh, uh, that could take
a bit. Can you wait?</i>

502
00:38:05,035 --> 00:38:06,703
Yes, ma'am, I can. Thank you.

503
00:38:06,787 --> 00:38:07,829
<i>Okay, hold on.</i>

504
00:38:13,502 --> 00:38:16,547
<i>Okay. Oh, are you still there?</i>

505
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:17,631
Yes, ma'am.

506
00:38:18,131 --> 00:38:20,884
<i>Sorry, uh, we have no record
of a Civil War reenactment</i>

507
00:38:20,968 --> 00:38:23,011
<i>over the last three years.</i>

508
00:38:23,095 --> 00:38:24,346
Okay.

509
00:38:24,888 --> 00:38:27,140
Well, thank you for your
time. Appreciate it.

510
00:38:27,224 --> 00:38:29,518
<i>However, there was
a Revolutionary War.</i>

511
00:38:30,769 --> 00:38:31,770
What is that?

512
00:38:31,854 --> 00:38:35,607
<i>I said there was a Revolutionary
War reenactment though.</i>

513
00:38:35,691 --> 00:38:36,692
When?

514
00:38:36,775 --> 00:38:38,944
<i>Last summer, Forest Glen Park.</i>

515
00:38:39,027 --> 00:38:44,116
<i>Uh, the exact date was,
let me see, uh, July 19th.</i>

516
00:38:46,827 --> 00:38:47,870
<i>Hello?</i>

517
00:38:48,662 --> 00:38:50,038
<i>Hello, are you still there?</i>

518
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:53,458
<i>Detective?</i>

519
00:38:54,459 --> 00:38:56,086
Okay. Thank you.

520
00:38:56,587 --> 00:38:57,838
[handset settles in cradle]

521
00:38:58,505 --> 00:38:59,673
[buzzer sounds]

522
00:39:06,597 --> 00:39:07,764
[Jimmy] Sammy?

523
00:39:12,436 --> 00:39:13,729
Great.

524
00:39:23,572 --> 00:39:24,823
Where's Dad?

525
00:39:25,741 --> 00:39:27,117
Oy. [sighs]

526
00:39:27,784 --> 00:39:32,581
He came in from the yard last
week talking funny, you know,

527
00:39:32,664 --> 00:39:34,499
like he was drunk,
but he wasn't.

528
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,794
He said that he had a headache.

529
00:39:37,878 --> 00:39:39,254
[stammers] You know, he...

530
00:39:39,338 --> 00:39:41,757
He went to sit down,
but he missed the chair.

531
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:44,301
And the side of his
face went all droopy...

532
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:45,719
- He had a stroke?
- Yeah.

533
00:39:45,802 --> 00:39:47,846
- Is he alive?
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's alive.

534
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:50,349
He was in the hospital for a
few days, but now he's out.

535
00:39:50,432 --> 00:39:51,558
Is he okay?

536
00:39:54,228 --> 00:39:55,771
Is he okay?

537
00:39:55,854 --> 00:39:57,147
Told me to say he was…

538
00:39:59,399 --> 00:40:00,567
but he's not.

539
00:40:01,735 --> 00:40:05,948
He can't talk all the way right,
and he walks kinda to the side.

540
00:40:06,031 --> 00:40:08,700
He's really weak, and he tires.

541
00:40:08,784 --> 00:40:12,371
He's... [sobs] He's
not good at all, no.

542
00:40:14,164 --> 00:40:15,290
When did it happen?

543
00:40:15,874 --> 00:40:19,545
Uh, last week. Wednesday.

544
00:40:19,628 --> 00:40:21,630
- Why didn't anybody tell me?
- I am telling you.

545
00:40:21,713 --> 00:40:24,132
Before. Someone should have
called me. I'm his son.

546
00:40:24,675 --> 00:40:27,302
Well, he is like
a baby right now.

547
00:40:27,886 --> 00:40:31,431
I had to have my sister drive two hours
to watch him so I could come and tell you.

548
00:40:31,515 --> 00:40:33,100
What do you want?
A fucking parade?

549
00:40:36,186 --> 00:40:40,566
You know, the doctor said
it was stress that did it.

550
00:40:42,651 --> 00:40:45,821
Know what caused that
stress? You. In here.

551
00:40:46,864 --> 00:40:49,575
It is all he ever
fucking talks about.

552
00:40:49,658 --> 00:40:53,120
His poor Jimmy doing time
because he was a bad father.

553
00:40:54,121 --> 00:40:56,331
[cries] He was a bad
father. Didn't do his job.

554
00:40:56,415 --> 00:40:58,458
Well, listen to
me. He did his job.

555
00:40:59,126 --> 00:41:00,878
Nobody made you sell that shit.

556
00:41:01,378 --> 00:41:02,963
Nobody put a gun to your head.

557
00:41:03,505 --> 00:41:06,049
And now you're in here,
and it is killing him.

558
00:41:16,393 --> 00:41:17,394
You through?

559
00:41:19,313 --> 00:41:23,817
He told me you got some way of getting
out of here earlier than the ten years.

560
00:41:26,570 --> 00:41:28,238
He don't got ten years.

561
00:41:29,281 --> 00:41:33,827
And if you stay in here,
he don't got three.

562
00:41:47,257 --> 00:41:49,009
[buzzer sounds]

[line ringing]

565
00:42:15,494 --> 00:42:19,790
Detective Drysdale, this is Brian
Miller from Georgetown again.

566
00:42:19,873 --> 00:42:20,999
Oh, hey, Brian.

567
00:42:21,959 --> 00:42:26,004
Yeah, well, that Civil War tip you gave
us really paid off. Thank you for that.

568
00:42:26,797 --> 00:42:28,632
You said you grew
up with, uh, Larry.

569
00:42:28,715 --> 00:42:30,884
Well, what's he like?

570
00:42:30,968 --> 00:42:32,678
- <i>A harmless weirdo.</i>
- [static]

571
00:42:35,138 --> 00:42:38,016
Sorry. Sorry, I...
I got "harmless."

572
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:41,061
<i>I... I said, he's
a harmless weirdo.</i>

573
00:42:41,562 --> 00:42:43,522
Uh-huh. Why weirdo?

574
00:42:43,605 --> 00:42:46,942
Well, the... the
sideburns, like I said.

575
00:42:47,025 --> 00:42:50,904
He, um, he grew up with a
mom and dad who were odd.

576
00:42:50,988 --> 00:42:53,740
<i>And, uh, the cemetery, you know.</i>

577
00:42:54,491 --> 00:42:55,659
The cemetery?

578
00:42:56,368 --> 00:42:57,828
- [speaks indistinctly]
- [static]

579
00:42:57,911 --> 00:42:58,912
<i>A what?</i>

580
00:42:58,996 --> 00:43:02,040
A gravedigger. Larry
grew up on a graveyard.

581
00:43:02,541 --> 00:43:03,834
But he's harmless.

582
00:43:03,917 --> 00:43:05,127
<i>Why would you say that?</i>

583
00:43:05,627 --> 00:43:07,713
He just is. He's a
twerpy kinda guy.

584
00:43:07,796 --> 00:43:09,464
<i>He got beat up a
bunch in school.</i>

585
00:43:09,548 --> 00:43:10,549
Uh-huh.

586
00:43:11,175 --> 00:43:13,677
The thing is, there's a
girl that went missing...

587
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,679
The college girl? [chuckles]

588
00:43:15,762 --> 00:43:18,056
He confessed to that,
but he didn't do it.

589
00:43:19,183 --> 00:43:20,517
<i>Marion PD cleared him.</i>

590
00:43:20,601 --> 00:43:23,395
Said he was, a...
a serial confessor.

591
00:43:23,896 --> 00:43:25,522
But... N... No, I...

592
00:43:27,399 --> 00:43:30,903
[stammers] He confessed
in a missing persons case?

593
00:43:30,986 --> 00:43:32,946
Ye... In Marion, yeah.

594
00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:35,449
They ascertained he was
full of shit. That...

595
00:43:35,532 --> 00:43:38,952
But that's Larry. He's always trying
to make himself look bigger than he is.

00:45:03,662 --> 00:45:04,663
Hey.

601
00:45:04,746 --> 00:45:05,747
[Chris] <i>I'm back.</i>

602
00:45:05,831 --> 00:45:09,751
Yeah. So, Chris, the thing is,

603
00:45:10,627 --> 00:45:14,965
we got a girl, went
missing, turned up dead.

604
00:45:15,799 --> 00:45:18,760
And you think Larry Hall could
have something to do with it?

605
00:45:19,261 --> 00:45:20,387
<i>Well, we don't know.</i>

606
00:45:20,929 --> 00:45:25,851
<i>What we do know is a van was
seen driving around the area</i>

607
00:45:25,934 --> 00:45:30,898
and, you know, he was creeping out girls
in the area on more than one occasion.

608
00:45:30,981 --> 00:45:33,942
So, with your help, we'd
like to talk to him.

609
00:45:38,238 --> 00:45:40,866
Well, I mean… [sighs]

610
00:45:42,201 --> 00:45:43,911
I have to disagree
with you here.

611
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:48,332
On which part?

612
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:51,877
Where Larry Hall could have
anything to do with a dead girl.

613
00:45:53,921 --> 00:45:55,506
He just likes to talk.

614
00:45:56,507 --> 00:45:57,674
Like in Marion.

615
00:45:57,758 --> 00:46:01,512
They got the guy who did it,
and it sure wasn't Larry.

616
00:46:05,224 --> 00:46:06,308
Fair enough.

617
00:46:07,726 --> 00:46:10,270
[static]

618
00:46:10,354 --> 00:46:13,815
I'll call him in here,
and I'll get us a room.

619
00:46:13,899 --> 00:46:15,108
I'll set it up.

620
00:46:16,652 --> 00:46:19,321
Uh, 10:00 tomorrow work for you?

621
00:46:20,072 --> 00:46:22,699
Yes. Sure. Yes.

622
00:46:22,783 --> 00:46:24,743
You think you can get him
there without a hitch?

623
00:46:24,826 --> 00:46:26,411
If I can't, I'll call you.

624
00:46:26,495 --> 00:46:27,955
Else, I'll see you at 10:00.

625
00:46:36,588 --> 00:46:37,589
Okay.

626
00:46:44,346 --> 00:46:46,306
- I said, okay.
- I heard the word.

627
00:46:47,724 --> 00:46:48,976
Why don't you elaborate?

628
00:46:51,770 --> 00:46:53,355
I'll accept the transfer

629
00:46:54,481 --> 00:46:58,235
and befriend this sick fucking
puppy and get you what you want.

630
00:46:59,236 --> 00:47:00,612
So, let's get to it.

631
00:47:03,490 --> 00:47:05,576
I'm glad you've made
yourself available.

632
00:47:07,286 --> 00:47:09,454
But I never said
the job was yours.

633
00:47:11,164 --> 00:47:12,791
I asked if you were interested.

634
00:47:13,292 --> 00:47:14,835
- Now I know you are.
- Wait a second.

635
00:47:14,918 --> 00:47:17,671
We're looking at more than one
applicant for the position.

636
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:21,175
Fuck are you talking about?

637
00:47:21,258 --> 00:47:22,593
I just told you.

638
00:47:25,637 --> 00:47:28,140
I'll let my bosses know
you're amenable to a transfer

639
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:32,311
and put your name in
the hat for the job.

640
00:47:32,394 --> 00:47:33,604
And we'll go from there.

641
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:41,195
Keep doing your homework.

642
00:47:41,945 --> 00:47:44,531
You're not going to want to blow
the job interview, believe me.

643
00:47:47,868 --> 00:47:51,205
[door opens, closes]

644
00:48:27,616 --> 00:48:31,411
Hi. Detective Miller. I have
a 10:00 a.m. with Drysdale.

645
00:48:31,495 --> 00:48:33,872
- [Chris] Brian?
- Chris!

646
00:48:33,956 --> 00:48:35,541
Hey, it's good to meet you.

647
00:48:35,624 --> 00:48:36,667
Likewise.

648
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:38,544
- He in a box?
- Oh, Larry?

649
00:48:38,627 --> 00:48:40,045
No, he's across the street.

650
00:48:40,128 --> 00:48:42,464
We got him in a conference
room with the Marion guys.

651
00:48:43,131 --> 00:48:44,383
The detectives?

652
00:48:44,466 --> 00:48:46,552
Yeah. They want to question
him on the Reitler case.

653
00:48:47,845 --> 00:48:49,179
We wanted to observe.

654
00:48:49,263 --> 00:48:51,557
But I was hoping that
he would be at ease.

655
00:48:52,307 --> 00:48:53,725
Not think anything was up.

656
00:48:53,809 --> 00:48:57,062
Well, uh, he spent a whole day with
the Marion guys once, driving around.

657
00:48:57,145 --> 00:48:58,522
He's pretty relaxed with them.

658
00:48:59,606 --> 00:49:01,066
Why were they driving around?

659
00:49:01,567 --> 00:49:03,986
He claimed he could take them
to a body. Patricia Reitler's.

660
00:49:04,011 --> 00:49:06,215
- But he didn't, because, like I said...
- Yeah, no, no, no.

661
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:07,659
He's "full of shit." I know.

662
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:16,540
Detective Russ Aborn, Brian Miller,
with the Vermilion Sheriffs.

663
00:49:16,623 --> 00:49:17,624
Hey.

664
00:49:17,708 --> 00:49:19,960
Derek's in with him
now, shooting the shit.

665
00:49:20,043 --> 00:49:23,589
Um, I know you like him for
some dead girl in your town,

666
00:49:23,672 --> 00:49:26,758
but we wasted a day with
this guy on the Reitler case.

667
00:49:26,842 --> 00:49:30,345
And he dragged us all around,
one cornfield to the next,

668
00:49:30,429 --> 00:49:32,598
and he didn't do it.

669
00:49:32,681 --> 00:49:35,100
So, I doubt he did yours.

670
00:49:35,184 --> 00:49:38,228
He just likes confessing
to cops. [scoffs]

671
00:49:40,689 --> 00:49:41,857
Good to know.

672
00:49:52,242 --> 00:49:53,327
Derek Johansen.

673
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:58,498
Now, those are some
exquisite burnsides.

674
00:49:59,625 --> 00:50:02,878
Named after General
Ambrose Burnside,

675
00:50:03,462 --> 00:50:05,797
a civil war general from
around these parts, right?

676
00:50:05,881 --> 00:50:11,136
A lot of people call them sideburns,
but the proper term is burnsides, yeah.

677
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:14,056
Well, yours are impressive,
no matter what they're called.

678
00:50:14,556 --> 00:50:16,225
You leave them in
place year-round?

679
00:50:16,725 --> 00:50:21,188
Yeah, it's easier than having to
regrow them before every reenactment.

680
00:50:21,271 --> 00:50:25,609
Mm-hmm. You do both the Civil War and
Revolutionary War reenactments, right?

681
00:50:26,568 --> 00:50:29,571
Sorry, I... I'm Brian.

682
00:50:29,655 --> 00:50:33,116
I'm with the Vermilion County
Sheriffs in Georgetown.

683
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:34,243
Indiana?

684
00:50:34,326 --> 00:50:35,369
Uh, Illinois.

685
00:50:38,205 --> 00:50:39,373
Never heard of it.

686
00:50:40,290 --> 00:50:41,291
Hmm.

687
00:50:42,125 --> 00:50:45,587
Mmm, we had a Revolutionary
War reenactment.

688
00:50:45,671 --> 00:50:49,883
I guess it was... It was one
town over. The same county.

689
00:50:50,968 --> 00:50:55,681
You didn't attend a Revolutionary War
reenactment in Illinois last summer?

690
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:01,979
Uh… [stammers] I
don't know, may-maybe.

691
00:51:02,771 --> 00:51:06,942
Well, yeah, he did a lot of this when
he was leading us to Tricia Reitler.

692
00:51:07,025 --> 00:51:08,944
"Uh, I don't know, maybe."

693
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:10,863
Didn't you, Larry?

694
00:51:12,823 --> 00:51:17,494
C'mon, tell him, Larry. Tell him
how you, uh, I don't know, maybe.

695
00:51:17,578 --> 00:51:19,371
Mmm, and, uh, I can't
quite remember...

696
00:51:19,454 --> 00:51:21,415
If you want to question
Mr. Hall in your case,

697
00:51:21,498 --> 00:51:23,142
why don't you go ahead
and arrange a time.

698
00:51:23,166 --> 00:51:25,127
Right now, I'd like to
chat with him about mine.

699
00:51:28,463 --> 00:51:30,507
By all means, chat.

700
00:51:33,927 --> 00:51:38,557
All right, Larry, this is, um… This
is, uh, Georgetown right here, okay?

701
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:43,353
And... And this is,
uh, Forest Glen Park.

702
00:51:44,605 --> 00:51:45,689
Uh…

703
00:51:48,525 --> 00:51:50,360
- Mmm.
- And… [murmurs indistinctly]

704
00:51:51,153 --> 00:51:53,030
McHenry Township, right up here.

705
00:51:53,113 --> 00:51:55,866
And this would have been where
the reenactment take place.

706
00:51:55,949 --> 00:51:58,035
Oh, McHenry. Yeah,
I've been there.

707
00:51:58,869 --> 00:51:59,870
Last summer?

708
00:52:00,913 --> 00:52:04,416
[stammers] I mean, I th... I
think so, yeah. Like around there.

709
00:52:05,501 --> 00:52:09,171
I know that there's a
Hardee's... [sighs] Sorry.

710
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:11,381
No, it's okay.

711
00:52:14,301 --> 00:52:17,137
I remember there was a
Hardee's right around here.

712
00:52:17,221 --> 00:52:19,640
That's right. They do,
Larry. It's right here.

713
00:52:19,723 --> 00:52:24,353
Yep. I had a sandwich
and some french fries

714
00:52:24,436 --> 00:52:29,399
when I was driving around trying
to find a guy who had a Charger.

715
00:52:30,275 --> 00:52:31,735
A D-Dodge?

716
00:52:32,236 --> 00:52:39,117
Yeah. I have a '82 Dodge van, and
some of the parts are interchangeable.

717
00:52:40,494 --> 00:52:41,995
Did you ever find the guy?

718
00:52:44,998 --> 00:52:47,084
No, I don't think that I did.

719
00:52:48,001 --> 00:52:51,088
- But you drove around looking?
- Yep.

720
00:52:51,171 --> 00:52:55,759
Larry loves Dodges. Heard all about
them that day we drove him around.

721
00:52:55,843 --> 00:52:58,136
Yeah, well, I like Mopar parts.

722
00:52:58,220 --> 00:53:03,809
Uh, I'll find these little junkers
that are rusted underneath a tree

723
00:53:03,892 --> 00:53:06,812
or behind some of
these people's houses.

724
00:53:07,513 --> 00:53:09,040
They're not doing
nothing with them.

725
00:53:09,064 --> 00:53:12,401
So… maybe I know a body shop

726
00:53:12,484 --> 00:53:17,573
that… needs a tailpipe

727
00:53:17,656 --> 00:53:20,659
or… filter housing,

728
00:53:20,742 --> 00:53:24,663
and then I'll just buy it
for 20 and resell it for 35.

729
00:53:24,746 --> 00:53:27,583
Hmm. Must be a lot
of driving around.

730
00:53:27,666 --> 00:53:29,001
Oh, yeah. A lot of miles.

731
00:53:29,084 --> 00:53:30,294
But I-I like to drive.

732
00:53:30,377 --> 00:53:31,378
Hmm.

733
00:53:32,171 --> 00:53:35,966
And when you were driving around, do
you remember talking to two girls?

734
00:53:42,139 --> 00:53:45,934
I asked for directions. They're...
They're... They were very rude.

735
00:53:46,018 --> 00:53:47,269
How were they rude?

736
00:53:49,104 --> 00:53:54,526
[scoffs] They... They told
me to... They told me to...

737
00:53:57,362 --> 00:53:58,572
Sorry, w-what?

738
00:53:59,281 --> 00:54:01,783
Told me... Told me
to go fuck myself.

739
00:54:02,367 --> 00:54:04,161
Did you exchange
words with them?

740
00:54:04,244 --> 00:54:06,121
I did. It was all in fun.

741
00:54:06,747 --> 00:54:09,666
Like the misunderstanding
with the jogger, Larry?

742
00:54:09,750 --> 00:54:11,001
Uh, y-y-yeah. Yeah.

743
00:54:11,084 --> 00:54:12,669
- Yeah.
- Misunderstanding?

744
00:54:12,753 --> 00:54:15,339
Larry had some words with a
jogger in town a few times.

745
00:54:15,422 --> 00:54:17,049
She, uh, accused
him of stalking her.

746
00:54:17,132 --> 00:54:19,176
K... I... I didn't stalk anyone.

747
00:54:19,259 --> 00:54:21,261
Yeah, I can't help
it if I drive home

748
00:54:21,345 --> 00:54:25,682
past where some girl runs the
same time every day. I mean...

749
00:54:25,766 --> 00:54:28,352
Come on, Larry. Was a
little more to it than that.

750
00:54:28,435 --> 00:54:29,686
And she smiled at me.

751
00:54:29,770 --> 00:54:31,730
- She smiled at you?
- Yeah.

752
00:54:31,813 --> 00:54:35,692
- Hmm.
- Abby, the, uh... The jogger.

753
00:54:36,193 --> 00:54:37,361
And you know her name?

754
00:54:38,195 --> 00:54:39,905
Yeah, it's a small town.

755
00:54:44,785 --> 00:54:47,246
Larry, th… [clears throat]
These two girls in my town...

756
00:54:47,329 --> 00:54:49,206
You know, I was just
goofing around with them.

757
00:54:49,289 --> 00:54:51,124
If they said that
there was more to it,

758
00:54:51,208 --> 00:54:53,335
then they just didn't
get the joke, I'm sorry.

759
00:54:53,418 --> 00:54:56,171
I-I would never dream
of hurting two girls.

760
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:58,507
Well, you might dream
of it. [clears throat]

761
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:04,137
All right. What are you... What
are you guys talking about?

762
00:55:05,848 --> 00:55:07,975
Larry has vivid dreams.

763
00:55:09,059 --> 00:55:11,687
Tell Brian here about
your dreams, Larry.

764
00:55:15,941 --> 00:55:17,693
They're just dreams.

765
00:55:18,986 --> 00:55:20,320
Just tell me about 'em.

766
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:28,662
In my dreams, I...
[stammers] In... [sighs]

767
00:55:29,162 --> 00:55:35,252
In my dreams, I, like…
kill women… you know?

768
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:40,841
Sure.

769
00:55:42,050 --> 00:55:43,719
They're just dreams.

770
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:50,767
Tell me more.

770
00:55:51,305 --> 00:56:51,269
