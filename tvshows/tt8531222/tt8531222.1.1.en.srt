Hello there. I'm Dr. Mecklebaum.

7
00:00:16,056 --> 00:00:18,256
- I'm Dave Burd. How are you?
- Good. Good to see you.

8
00:00:18,258 --> 00:00:20,759
So, uh... what brings you in today?

9
00:00:20,761 --> 00:00:22,427
So, a few days ago I was shaving,

10
00:00:22,429 --> 00:00:24,528
and I noticed these red
bumps on my pubiscus,

11
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:26,631
- and I just wanted...
- P-Pubiscus?

12
00:00:26,633 --> 00:00:28,933
That's probably not
the medical term for it.

13
00:00:28,935 --> 00:00:30,735
Uh, like, where your pubic hair would be

14
00:00:30,737 --> 00:00:32,704
if you didn't shave it all the way.

15
00:00:32,706 --> 00:00:34,313
- Oh. Oh, copy that. All right.
- Yeah. Yeah.

16
00:00:34,315 --> 00:00:35,439
So, well, let's take a look.

17
00:00:35,441 --> 00:00:38,430
Yes, and I know this is
gonna sound so absurd,

18
00:00:38,432 --> 00:00:40,257
but before I can just show you my penis,

19
00:00:40,259 --> 00:00:41,445
I do have to kind of explain

20
00:00:41,447 --> 00:00:43,814
- a few things about it to you.
- Okay.

21
00:00:43,816 --> 00:00:47,572
I just have, like, a very
bizarre situation down...

22
00:00:47,574 --> 00:00:49,488
okay, when I was born,

23
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:51,579
I came out of the womb
with a tangled urethra,

24
00:00:51,581 --> 00:00:52,818
so immediately they had to go in

25
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,386
- and do all types of surgery to it.
- Mm-hmm.

26
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:56,429
As a result, there's so
much scarring down there.

27
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:57,556
- Sure.
- And then, I mean,

28
00:00:57,558 --> 00:00:59,024
you know how the skin on your testicles

29
00:00:59,026 --> 00:01:01,160
is a different type of skin
than the skin on your penis?

30
00:01:01,162 --> 00:01:04,362
It's more... chicken-skinned or ribbed.

31
00:01:04,364 --> 00:01:05,487
Yeah?

32
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:07,946
So my dick skin is actually made of

33
00:01:07,948 --> 00:01:09,702
that exact same style of ribbing.

34
00:01:09,704 --> 00:01:11,704
All the way up my shaft... ribs.

35
00:01:11,706 --> 00:01:13,981
So my theory is: when
they had to replace

36
00:01:13,983 --> 00:01:15,240
the hacked-off dick skin,

37
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:17,677
they used my testicle
skin to replace it.

38
00:01:17,679 --> 00:01:20,011
Which would mean that my dick

39
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:22,380
is made of balls.

40
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:25,984
I couldn't be more precious
about this information.

41
00:01:25,986 --> 00:01:27,919
My own girlfriend doesn't
know anything about this

42
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:30,056
because I'm so good at
controlling the lighting and...

43
00:01:30,058 --> 00:01:31,324
Well, if-if you're comfortable,

44
00:01:31,326 --> 00:01:33,258
I'm-I'm more than happy to take a look.

45
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,993
I just had to explain all
that, 'cause I didn't want you

46
00:01:34,995 --> 00:01:36,430
to look at it and be like...

47
00:01:37,508 --> 00:01:38,763
- You know? Yeah.
- Yeah. Sure.

Okay. I mean, but can't genital
herpes look like razor bumps?

53
00:01:51,434 --> 00:01:52,877

Wayne like, "What you do?"

174
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:01,860
And I end up getting three
songs off the drip alone.

175
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:03,596
You have three songs with Lil Wayne?

Remember that guy Nutti

615
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:37,294
- that you set me up with for the YG verse?
- Mm-hmm.

616
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,364
So, they said "yes" to doing a song.

617
00:21:39,366 --> 00:21:41,299
I sent him $10,000.

618
00:21:41,301 --> 00:21:43,166
As soon as the money went through,

619
00:21:43,168 --> 00:21:45,960
he completely stopped responding
to all my text messages.

620
00:21:45,962 --> 00:21:49,040
And the whole thing feels very...

621
00:21:49,042 --> 00:21:51,075
- coincidental and...
- Wait, wait, wait.

622
00:21:51,077 --> 00:21:53,080
Coincidental how?

623
00:21:54,347 --> 00:21:57,915
You know, I have to assume
that my money's gone,

624
00:21:57,917 --> 00:22:00,851
and Gata set the whole
thing up, so I don't mean

625
00:22:00,853 --> 00:22:01,886
- to be accusing...
- Hold up, bro.

626
00:22:01,888 --> 00:22:03,588
Ain't nobody run off with nothing, man.

627
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:05,511
Nutti changed his number.
You got to kill that energy

628
00:22:05,513 --> 00:22:06,746
in my house, though. For real.

629
00:22:06,748 --> 00:22:09,750
- Nutti changed his cell phone number?
- That's what I just said.

630
00:22:09,752 --> 00:22:11,899
Who would change their number in the
middle of a $10,000 wire exchange?

631
00:22:11,901 --> 00:22:13,865
I'm sending you his new
line right now. Relax.

632
00:22:13,867 --> 00:22:16,067
Okay, I'm gonna text him right now.

633
00:22:16,069 --> 00:22:17,812
GATA: Come on, bro, you
got me looking crazy.

634
00:22:17,814 --> 00:22:20,104
No, I wasn't saying that I was
certain it was you, by the way.

635
00:22:20,106 --> 00:22:22,373
I was just trying to
think about what happened

636
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:25,342
and replaying everything and
thinking about who the suspects

637
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:28,079
- could even be and...
- Oh, and you thought of my son.

638
00:22:28,081 --> 00:22:30,080
Gee, I wonder why that is.

639
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:31,642
GATA: Small things to a giant.

640
00:22:31,644 --> 00:22:33,084
I ain't even tripping,
this shit regular.

641
00:22:33,086 --> 00:22:35,564
People size me up all the
time and stereotype me.

642
00:22:35,566 --> 00:22:38,522
Putting me in a box like
I'm some thug. Just like you.

643
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:40,945
You look like a nerd, all corny.
But you rap hard, though.

644
00:22:40,947 --> 00:22:43,056
Like, people play they self
when they do that shit, man.

645
00:22:43,058 --> 00:22:44,727
How you gonna do me like that?

646
00:22:47,266 --> 00:22:49,099
I hear you.

647
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:52,770
And... it seems I have
made a fool of myself

648
00:22:52,772 --> 00:22:54,438
and I'm very sorry.

649
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:57,407
- You should be.
- I know. And I'm...

650
00:22:57,409 --> 00:22:59,242
- (PHONE CHIMES)
- ... embarrassed.

651
00:22:59,244 --> 00:23:01,654
I'm sorry. Oh, my God.
Nutti just responded.

652
00:23:01,656 --> 00:23:03,331
Uh, he says if we go right
now, we can do the verse.

653
00:23:03,333 --> 00:23:04,482
YG in the studio right now?

654
00:23:04,484 --> 00:23:05,881
- Yeah.
- Oh, I got to go with you, bro.

655
00:23:05,883 --> 00:23:06,650
We got to get this sorted out.

656
00:23:06,652 --> 00:23:08,452

- Yeah, I'm going.

what's good. What's good, Nutti?

672
00:23:45,578 --> 00:23:48,162

- Bro, I'm the one that set this

not only was he right,
