that you now teach
seventh graders.

00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:32,181
‐Yes.
‐Uh, do you, like,
find yourself working more

68
00:02:44,973 --> 00:02:46,309
‐but it's whatever.
‐Not cool.

EMMA:
Talk your shit, girl.

‐If I... Okay.

71
00:02:49,482 --> 00:02:51,185
I'd love to hear more.
But what about Thursday?

72
00:02:51,219 --> 00:02:53,189
‐Maybe. Maybe.
‐Okay, I'll text you.

73

Bye.

Hmm, you deserve
a proper goodbye.

00:03:01,005 --> 00:03:02,542
Okay, for real, though.

78
00:03:02,575 --> 00:03:03,911
Did you guys hook up?

79
00:03:03,944 --> 00:03:05,213
No.

80
00:03:05,247 --> 00:03:07,619
I actually vomited on her.

81
00:03:07,652 --> 00:03:09,623
I don't even want to know more.

82
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:11,593
What? You know everything.
I just told you.

83
00:03:11,627 --> 00:03:12,962

Are you serious, Dave?

91
00:03:26,657 --> 00:03:29,896
Kareem Abdul‐Jabbar heard
"Kareem Abdul‐Jabbar."

92
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:31,466
‐No, he didn't.
‐Yeah.

93
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,537
‐His manager just emailed me.
‐Wow!

94
00:03:33,571 --> 00:03:35,508

‐It's been out
for a year and a half.

95

‐He's hearing it now?
‐He's 73, Dave.

96
00:03:38,046 --> 00:03:39,516
Kareem the Dream?

97

The leading scorer
in NBA history?

98
00:03:41,352 --> 00:03:43,491
‐That's the guy.
‐Is sitting over there
listening to LD?

99
00:03:43,524 --> 00:03:45,460
Wait till he hears
your debut album Penith.

100
00:03:45,495 --> 00:03:47,632
‐If you ever write it.
‐Yeah, I'm sure
he's gonna love it.

101
00:03:47,665 --> 00:03:49,836
Man, the piss is just,
it's shooting out of my dick

102
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,740
right now
with this new information.

103
00:03:51,774 --> 00:03:53,677
Good job, Mike. Way to... I
don't know if you did anything,

104
00:03:53,711 --> 00:03:54,913
‐but good job.
‐I did.

105
00:03:54,946 --> 00:03:57,284
Ah, man! Unbelievable.

106
00:03:57,317 --> 00:03:58,621
Yeah, he wants
to meet you today.

107
00:03:58,654 --> 00:03:59,756
What is with this doorknob?

108
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:01,359
He wants to meet me today?

109
00:04:01,392 --> 00:04:02,461
Yeah, today.

110
00:04:02,495 --> 00:04:03,964
This is‐‐ Ah! What a dream!

111
00:04:03,998 --> 00:04:05,535
The man made of silk?

112
00:04:05,568 --> 00:04:06,904
‐Uh‐huh.
‐And me?

113
00:04:06,937 --> 00:04:08,306
What are we gonna do?
This is unbelie...

114
00:04:08,339 --> 00:04:09,709
I'm gonna touch his head and...

115
00:04:09,743 --> 00:04:11,012
kiss‐‐ I might kiss his face.

116
00:04:11,045 --> 00:04:12,549
‐Don't...
‐I got to piss so fu...

117
00:04:12,582 --> 00:04:13,984
‐Don't touch or kiss him, Dave.
‐Hey.

118
00:04:14,018 --> 00:04:16,322
What's with the bathroom door?
It's not opening.

119
00:04:16,355 --> 00:04:17,759
‐Turn the knob.
Try turning it the other way.
‐I turned it, so...

120
00:04:17,792 --> 00:04:19,596
Can you fix this?

121
00:04:19,629 --> 00:04:21,466
I'm not the handyman, Dave.

122
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,573
Look. I'm running errands all
day, so I'll‐I'll figure it out.

123
00:04:24,606 --> 00:04:25,575
‐I'll take care of it, okay?
‐I'm gonna go outside

124
00:04:25,608 --> 00:04:26,743
and piss on an anthill

125
00:04:26,777 --> 00:04:27,879
and watch them all burn.

126
00:04:27,912 --> 00:04:29,950
‐Okay.
‐Kareem!

127
00:04:29,983 --> 00:04:32,354
Bruh, why the fuck you got us
eating this American food, bro?

128
00:04:32,387 --> 00:04:34,391
I was just at this
Ethiopian spot the other day.

129
00:04:34,425 --> 00:04:36,062
That shit was fine nigga!
I mean, I'm telling you,

130
00:04:36,095 --> 00:04:38,366
like, super fine, bro.
And I just found out

131
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:40,671
that it's 2013 in Ethiopia, bro.

132
00:04:40,705 --> 00:04:42,675
What‐what does that...
What do you‐‐ No, they're...

133
00:04:42,709 --> 00:04:44,546
It's now in Ethiopia.

134
00:04:44,579 --> 00:04:45,882
Man, you got to respect it, bro.

135
00:04:45,915 --> 00:04:47,652
They doing their own thing
over there.

136
00:04:47,685 --> 00:04:49,488
‐Why are we eating this shit?
‐Okay, I‐I don't know

137
00:04:49,523 --> 00:04:50,457
what you're talking about,
but we're eating at this place

138
00:04:50,491 --> 00:04:51,760
because my clients wanted

139
00:04:51,794 --> 00:04:53,531
‐to meet me here, so...
‐Your clients?

140
00:04:53,564 --> 00:04:54,833
How the fuck
you got new clients, bro?

141
00:04:54,866 --> 00:04:56,402
You didn't even check
my music out yet.

142
00:04:56,435 --> 00:04:57,906
I'm posting my shit
all in the comments,

143
00:04:57,939 --> 00:05:00,310
‐tweeting at reality shows.
‐I know. Gata, it...

144
00:05:00,343 --> 00:05:02,481
it slid on my desk‐‐
I didn't even go looking for it.

145
00:05:02,515 --> 00:05:05,320
‐It just happened to be.
‐(scoffs) Oh, wow, so you
just moguling up out here,

146
00:05:05,353 --> 00:05:06,757
‐you and your boss shit, huh?
‐True.

147
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:08,894
MAN:
Attention, attention, everyone.

148
00:05:08,928 --> 00:05:11,967
This establishment
is being shut down immediately.

149
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,340
All right, we found out
they're serving horse meat.

150
00:05:15,373 --> 00:05:16,777
‐All right?
‐(excited chatter)

151
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:18,714
God, please don't eat that.
Thank you.

152
00:05:18,747 --> 00:05:20,417
We're gonna get this all
checked out.

153
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:21,553
We're gonna analyze it.

154
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:23,423
‐Nothing to worry about.
‐What?

155
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:25,427
‐What the hell is going on?
‐These sandwiches right here,

156
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:27,632
‐right here, everybody...
‐No. Stop. Listen.
I'm losing business!

157
00:05:27,665 --> 00:05:29,503
What are you doing!?

158
00:05:29,536 --> 00:05:31,472
‐Horsemeat.
‐You are ruining my life!

159
00:05:31,507 --> 00:05:34,613
(laughing):
Bro! Bro, it's a prank!

160
00:05:34,646 --> 00:05:36,950
‐Yo, it's a prank, bro!
‐Got eem!

161
00:05:36,984 --> 00:05:39,789
‐Dude, it's all fake.
It's a prank.
‐Yo, Mike, yo!

162
00:05:39,823 --> 00:05:41,660
Yo.

163
00:05:41,693 --> 00:05:42,729
‐What's up, Mike?
‐Dude, we got him, bro,
we got him!

164
00:05:42,762 --> 00:05:44,499
Very good, guys.

165
00:05:44,533 --> 00:05:46,637
These are The Stone Twins.
These are my clients.

166
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:48,373
‐They're huge on TikTok.
‐Yo, how'd it look?

167
00:05:48,406 --> 00:05:49,976
‐GATA: Wow.
‐It looked good.

168
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:51,847
I'm gonna have to get some
signatures, because‐‐ Right?

169
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,884
‐Yeah.
‐GATA: You mean to tell me y'all

170
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:55,487
fuck with people for a living,

171
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:57,424
put it on the Internet
and get paid?

172
00:05:57,457 --> 00:05:59,361
‐Yeah.
‐Yeah, it's our main thing,
but we also do challenges

173
00:05:59,395 --> 00:06:01,600
‐and dances.
‐Ah, that's some
white people shit for real.

174
00:06:01,633 --> 00:06:03,671
‐But I respect the gander
y'all got going.
‐Thanks, man.

175
00:06:03,704 --> 00:06:05,106
Uh, Gata's Lil Dicky's hype man.

176
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:07,110
Bro, he's a fucking legend.

177
00:06:07,144 --> 00:06:09,114
‐He's a legend.
‐That's why we signed with Mike.

178
00:06:09,148 --> 00:06:11,485
Oh, yeah, that's cool, but
I'm not just a hype man, though.

179
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,156
I really be rappin',
doing my shit, too.

180
00:06:13,189 --> 00:06:15,761
That's so fire. Yo, let us
shout you out on IG real quick,

181
00:06:15,795 --> 00:06:17,498
Oh, yeah, I'm gonna get y'all
on my shit, too.

182
00:06:17,532 --> 00:06:18,867
Ah, dude, we're gonna boost
you up, bro. Let's go.

183
00:06:18,901 --> 00:06:20,504
Oh, hell yeah.
Hey, I'm already...

184
00:06:20,538 --> 00:06:23,777
(Gata, Brody and Cody
all taking at once)

185
00:06:23,811 --> 00:06:25,046
Dude's got bars, bro...

186
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:31,860
Oh, my God, that's, like, Barack
Obama gave you thi

187
00:06:31,894 --> 00:06:33,597
didn't he? This is...

188
00:06:33,631 --> 00:06:36,135
That's a real MVP trophy.
How many MVPs have you won?

189
00:06:36,168 --> 00:06:37,839
‐Six.
‐Six?

190
00:06:37,872 --> 00:06:39,408
That's right.

191
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:41,112
Geez Louise. You still hoop?

192
00:06:41,145 --> 00:06:42,749
No.

193
00:06:42,782 --> 00:06:44,552
I mean, look at these shorts.
They're so tight.

194
00:06:44,586 --> 00:06:46,590
Like, aren't things, like,
flying and flopping around?

195
00:06:46,623 --> 00:06:49,562
‐And, I mean, the goggles...
‐Can I offer you something
to drink?

196
00:06:49,596 --> 00:06:51,432
I'd love a tall drink of water.

197
00:06:51,465 --> 00:06:53,102
You know where I can find one?

198
00:06:53,136 --> 00:06:55,440
Just messin' around.
This is from the era when guys

199
00:06:55,473 --> 00:06:56,877
were, like, you know,
going around dribbling

200
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:58,514
like this, you know,
and they're just, like...

201
00:06:58,547 --> 00:07:00,651
You got Cousy
running around, and...

202
00:07:00,685 --> 00:07:01,954
I feel like there were, like,

203
00:07:01,987 --> 00:07:03,791
Jewish men in the league
back then.

204
00:07:03,824 --> 00:07:06,697
Hey, how do you go about
picking a Muslim name?

205
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:08,601
Like, how, like...

206
00:07:08,634 --> 00:07:10,504
what is that process?

207
00:07:11,506 --> 00:07:12,976
Let's go sit down.

208
00:07:13,009 --> 00:07:14,111
Yeah.

209
00:07:14,144 --> 00:07:15,781
All right.

210
00:07:15,815 --> 00:07:17,184
Wow, what a foyer. Or "foy‐yay."

211
00:07:17,217 --> 00:07:18,520
‐Oh, thanks.
‐Yeah.

212
00:07:18,554 --> 00:07:20,156
What do you even do all day?

213
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,695
Well, these days
I spend a lot of time writing.

214
00:07:22,729 --> 00:07:24,031
Please, have a seat.

215
00:07:24,064 --> 00:07:25,801
Players' Tribune?

216
00:07:25,835 --> 00:07:27,705
I'm talking to them about,
uh, doing, like, a cartoon

217
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:29,008
with Rajon Rondo.

218
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:31,212
That's a crazy name:
Rajon Rondo.

219
00:07:31,245 --> 00:07:33,517
‐I wonder if he's, uh...
‐No,

220
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:36,857
I‐I, uh, actually write
about social issues.

221
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:38,560
‐Oh.
‐I'd love to write

222
00:07:38,594 --> 00:07:41,833
about you and your song.

223
00:07:41,867 --> 00:07:44,673
(sniffs) Hold on a minute,
I'm gonna go get some tea.

224
00:07:45,675 --> 00:07:47,545
Okay.

225
00:07:48,714 --> 00:07:50,718
Social issues?

226
00:07:55,193 --> 00:07:57,965
"By Kareem Abdul‐Jabbar."

227
00:07:57,999 --> 00:08:00,604
(teakettle whistling)

228
00:08:02,007 --> 00:08:03,644
"Race." "Privilege."

229
00:08:03,677 --> 00:08:05,080
"Lena Dunham"?

230
00:08:05,113 --> 00:08:07,250
Is this the same Kareem?

231
00:08:07,284 --> 00:08:09,756
‐(whistling loudly)
‐DAVE: How does he write
all these articles?

232
00:08:13,129 --> 00:08:15,534
If you don't mind,

233
00:08:15,568 --> 00:08:18,039
I'm gonna record
this conversation.

234
00:08:18,072 --> 00:08:21,145
Oh, uh, is this...
is this an interview?

235
00:08:21,178 --> 00:08:22,615
Yeah.

236
00:08:22,648 --> 00:08:23,984
(beep)

237
00:08:24,018 --> 00:08:25,053
DAVE:
Okay.

238
00:08:25,086 --> 00:08:26,957
What do you want to, uh...

239
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:28,527
discuss?

240
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,531
I'd like to know
what your inspiration was

241
00:08:30,564 --> 00:08:33,036
for superimposing your face...

242
00:08:33,069 --> 00:08:35,306
on my body.

243
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:37,044
Sure. Uh...

244
00:08:37,077 --> 00:08:39,716
And just so you know,
it's, uh, not just my face,

245
00:08:39,749 --> 00:08:44,024
it's not just my facial skin‐‐
it was, like, my whole, uh...

246
00:08:44,058 --> 00:08:46,262
skull and cranial...

247
00:08:46,295 --> 00:08:48,166
It was... So...

248
00:08:48,199 --> 00:08:50,871
like, it's not, uh...

249
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,642
it's not...

250
00:08:54,078 --> 00:08:56,550
...blackface.

251
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:58,152
What would you call it?

252
00:08:58,186 --> 00:08:59,689
Black‐body?

253
00:08:59,723 --> 00:09:01,660
Mm...

254
00:09:01,693 --> 00:09:03,096
maybe.

255
00:09:03,129 --> 00:09:05,166
I... It's Kareem‐body.

256
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,703
You know?

257
00:09:06,737 --> 00:09:08,272
Your body is, like, a sanctum.

258
00:09:08,306 --> 00:09:10,611
It's, like, it's‐it's, uh...

259
00:09:10,644 --> 00:09:12,214
it's so storied,

260
00:09:12,247 --> 00:09:15,755
and so it's more an homage
to your‐your, like,

261
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:18,794
your physical being,
not anything racial.

262
00:09:20,831 --> 00:09:23,169
(whispers):
Kareem... body.

263
00:09:23,202 --> 00:09:25,340
And by the way,
I am so down to admit

264
00:09:25,373 --> 00:09:26,843
that, like, looking back,

265
00:09:26,877 --> 00:09:28,714
m‐maybe not the best decision,
you know?

266
00:09:28,747 --> 00:09:31,620
Uh, you should know I made it,
like, a year and a half ago,

267
00:09:31,653 --> 00:09:33,757
and back then I wasn't a racist,
but I certainly wasn't

268
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:36,630
nearly as anti‐racist
as I am today.

269
00:09:36,663 --> 00:09:37,799
With...

270
00:09:39,301 --> 00:09:41,807
Um, so, but it was,
you know, uh...

271
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,178
By the way, this‐‐ You didn't
say "on the record" ever,

272
00:09:44,211 --> 00:09:45,614
I hope you know.

273
00:09:45,648 --> 00:09:48,386
So none of this is,
uh, permissible.

274
00:09:48,419 --> 00:09:50,858
(coughs, burps)
There are...

275
00:09:50,891 --> 00:09:52,194
sanctions.

276
00:09:52,227 --> 00:09:54,264
‐I would hate to...
‐Strictly speaking,

277
00:09:54,298 --> 00:09:57,270
unless someone says
it's off the record,

278
00:09:57,304 --> 00:09:59,241
it's on the record.

279
00:10:00,243 --> 00:10:02,582
Can I say something
off the record real quick?

280
00:10:03,717 --> 00:10:04,752
Yeah.

281
00:10:05,754 --> 00:10:07,257
I'm high.

282
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:09,863
Uh, I didn't know
that this was, like, gonna be

283
00:10:09,896 --> 00:10:11,332
this at all,
and I kind of, like,

284
00:10:11,365 --> 00:10:13,169
you know, mentally treated this

285
00:10:13,202 --> 00:10:15,908
like going to, like, a IMAX
or, like‐‐ I was so excited.

286
00:10:15,941 --> 00:10:18,847
And I'm working on that,
having to smoke for joy.

287
00:10:18,881 --> 00:10:21,185
‐I would never even call it
a shtick. I'm just saying...
‐There's a lot more,

288
00:10:21,218 --> 00:10:23,790
‐uh, of‐of a conversation
to be had...
‐(overlapping chatter)

289
00:10:23,824 --> 00:10:25,360
Around acne right now...

290
00:10:25,393 --> 00:10:26,997
...tons of nuance
to this whole thing.

291
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:28,901
I used to read
the Harry Potter books.

292
00:10:28,934 --> 00:10:30,704
Never watched a documentary.

293
00:10:30,738 --> 00:10:32,073
Have you ever heard of Babylon?

294
00:10:32,107 --> 00:10:33,342
(overlapping chatter)

295
00:10:33,376 --> 00:10:35,748
Tomorrow. What are you doing?

296
00:10:35,781 --> 00:10:38,085
'Cause maybe we spend the day
together, and I'll show you

297
00:10:38,119 --> 00:10:41,425
the real me, and you can write,
like, a full‐on profile on me.

298
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:42,829
No one's ever done that.

299
00:10:42,862 --> 00:10:44,899
Uh, if you're available.

300
00:10:46,168 --> 00:10:49,007
Okay. You know, I was
just gonna write a blurb on you

301
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:51,713
about my name in‐in your song.

302
00:10:51,746 --> 00:10:53,249
‐Oh.
‐But, uh,

303
00:10:53,282 --> 00:10:55,086
if you want to do a deep dive,
that's fine.

304
00:10:55,119 --> 00:10:57,424
That'll give me a chance
to dig deeper.

305
00:10:57,457 --> 00:10:58,392
Cool.

306
00:10:58,426 --> 00:11:00,196
That's great.

307
00:11:01,432 --> 00:11:04,672
Hope you like... Jews.

308
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:06,175
I'm saying,
I just don't get it. I‐‐

309
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:08,312
Like, you eat sugar, like,
for every single meal

310
00:11:08,346 --> 00:11:10,116
and you weigh, like, 125 pounds.

311
00:11:10,149 --> 00:11:12,120
‐Just‐‐ And you're cut.
‐Right. Uh‐huh.

312
00:11:12,153 --> 00:11:13,389
You have an eight‐pack.
It's gross.

313
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:15,126
I have a one‐pack
for the rest of my life.

314
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:17,464
That's true.
What the fuck?!

315
00:11:17,498 --> 00:11:18,934
Be careful, man.
There's eggs in there.

316
00:11:18,967 --> 00:11:20,403
You ain't gonna believe this,
bro.

317
00:11:20,436 --> 00:11:23,109
I got a audition
for Rhythm + Flow, dawg.

318
00:11:23,142 --> 00:11:24,913
‐Are they rebooting
a Terrence Howard pimp movie?
‐This has

319
00:11:24,946 --> 00:11:27,150
nothing to do with pimpin',
simpin' and limpin', bro.

320
00:11:27,183 --> 00:11:28,954
‐"Pimpin', simpin' and limpin'"?
‐This is way bigger than that.

321
00:11:28,987 --> 00:11:30,390
Ten times bigger than that.
This is American Idol

322
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:32,093
for rappers, dawg.
Like, you don't understand

323
00:11:32,127 --> 00:11:33,362
how big this is for me.

324
00:11:33,396 --> 00:11:34,966
Honestly, I'm proud of you, man.
That's...

325
00:11:34,999 --> 00:11:37,003
‐God's at work, huh?
‐Bro,

326
00:11:37,037 --> 00:11:39,241
‐don't bring God in this.
I'm blessed.
‐Right. Right.

327
00:11:39,274 --> 00:11:41,780
Hey, remember.
I'm gonna be on Rhythm + Flow.

328
00:11:41,813 --> 00:11:43,817
You're gonna be on Rhythm
+ Flow. I've got it locked in.

329
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:45,486
‐(knob rattling)
‐Oh, Gata, Gata,

330
00:11:45,521 --> 00:11:48,125
the‐the knob is broken. I got
to get it fixed today, so...

331
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:50,864
Man, don't worry about it, Mike.
I got a migo at the car shop.

332
00:11:50,898 --> 00:11:53,202
I'm‐a get it fixed.
He got all the tools.

333
00:11:53,236 --> 00:11:54,772
‐(door opens forcefully)
‐Whoo!

334
00:11:54,806 --> 00:11:56,910
Wonderful. Perfect.

335
00:11:56,943 --> 00:11:59,248
DAVE:
That's fine.

336
00:11:59,281 --> 00:12:01,418
That's okay.

337
00:12:01,452 --> 00:12:03,222
That's fine. Oh, here's one.

338
00:12:03,256 --> 00:12:06,262
"If being attracted
to 17‐year‐old girls is illegal,

339
00:12:06,295 --> 00:12:08,165
then send me straight
to Azkaban."

340
00:12:08,199 --> 00:12:10,036
Wh‐‐ Delete that. Oh, my God.

341
00:12:10,069 --> 00:12:11,873
‐You tweeted that at some point?
‐I'm just saying,

342
00:12:11,907 --> 00:12:14,211
like, you can tell when
a 17‐year‐old girl is, like,

343
00:12:14,244 --> 00:12:15,781
‐destined to be hot.
‐Blah, blah, blah.

344
00:12:15,814 --> 00:12:17,083
‐Don't. No.
‐What does that even mean?

345
00:12:17,117 --> 00:12:18,152
Mike, how the fuck
do you send me

346
00:12:18,185 --> 00:12:19,454
to this guy's house, high,

347
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:22,528
having no idea
it's a fucking interview?

348
00:12:22,561 --> 00:12:24,197
We can have
a deeper conversation about that

349
00:12:24,231 --> 00:12:27,203
at another time, because
I myself am very high now.

350
00:12:27,237 --> 00:12:29,909
I just need to show this guy
that I'm a good person.

351
00:12:29,943 --> 00:12:31,078
‐Nah.
‐You could just be
a good person.

352
00:12:31,111 --> 00:12:32,480
‐(laughs)
‐I am a good person.

353
00:12:32,515 --> 00:12:34,217
What do you mean?
Of course I'm a good person.

354
00:12:34,251 --> 00:12:35,888
He's just not around me enough
to, like, understand

355
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,290
my added value, socially.

356
00:12:37,324 --> 00:12:38,994
Did you really tweet

357
00:12:39,027 --> 00:12:41,231
‐"Can nonbinary people
fuck themselves?"
‐Yeah.

358
00:12:41,265 --> 00:12:43,269
It's a brilliant tweet.
What's wrong with that tweet?

359
00:12:43,302 --> 00:12:45,808
Do you even know
what "nonbinary" means?

360
00:12:45,841 --> 00:12:47,511
I understand what it means.
Like, they can fuck them‐‐

361
00:12:47,545 --> 00:12:49,114
Like, if you don't understand,
I don't know what to tell you.

362
00:12:49,147 --> 00:12:50,918
And it's brilliant.
And I'm a good person.

363
00:12:50,951 --> 00:12:54,024
But I will delete it,
because I'm being scrutinized

364
00:12:54,057 --> 00:12:56,295
by a seven‐foot‐three man
made of silk.

365
00:12:56,328 --> 00:12:59,034
I don't know how I'm gonna spend
an entire day with Kareem

366
00:12:59,067 --> 00:13:01,105
without saying something crazy.
It's not possible.

367
00:13:01,138 --> 00:13:03,376
I don't know how you'll last
an hour, to be honest.

368
00:13:03,409 --> 00:13:06,148
‐That's what I'm saying.
‐No. You guys, shut up.

369
00:13:06,181 --> 00:13:07,518
You've won the hearts
of many people

370
00:13:07,551 --> 00:13:10,189
that should have hated you
so many times.

371
00:13:10,223 --> 00:13:11,793
Like who?

372
00:13:12,995 --> 00:13:14,966
I'm sorry. I'm very high.
I was rambling.

373
00:13:14,999 --> 00:13:17,137
‐But‐but this is gonna be
a good press opportunity.
‐(Emma laughs)

374
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:19,007
I'm gonna get fucking crucified.

375
00:13:27,457 --> 00:13:28,927
Hey.

376
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,430
Hey, Dave. What's up?

377
00:13:30,463 --> 00:13:32,033
Just, uh, enjoying

378
00:13:32,067 --> 00:13:33,402
the, uh... the weather.

379
00:13:33,436 --> 00:13:35,541
The climate is, uh...

380
00:13:35,574 --> 00:13:36,943
Awesome out here, isn't it?

381
00:13:36,976 --> 00:13:38,914
‐Surviving today. Yeah.
‐Yeah.

382
00:13:38,947 --> 00:13:41,886
Although, obviously,
politically and, um,

383
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,458
meteorologically, it's...

384
00:13:44,492 --> 00:13:46,161
been a challenge.

385
00:13:46,195 --> 00:13:48,099
And will continue to be
a challenge.

386
00:13:49,101 --> 00:13:50,470
Thank you for meeting me here.

387
00:13:50,504 --> 00:13:52,207
Not a problem.

388
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,344
‐Let me get, uh...
‐(beep)
‐On the record.

389
00:13:54,378 --> 00:13:56,549
‐Yes. We're on the record.
‐Yes.

390
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:58,185
‐Okay.
‐That's how it has to be.

391
00:13:58,219 --> 00:13:59,354
That's okay.

392
00:13:59,388 --> 00:14:01,058
Okay. So, look, Dave,

393
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:03,497
hip‐hop is a very crowded space
these days.

394
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:04,599
Yeah.

395
00:14:04,632 --> 00:14:06,435
What do you bring to the table?

396
00:14:06,468 --> 00:14:08,439
Great question.

397
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:10,376
Uh, I...

398
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:12,213
am me.

399
00:14:12,247 --> 00:14:15,119
You know? I'm, like, my
unapologetic self at all times,

400
00:14:15,153 --> 00:14:17,257
and I think that's very clear
when you listen to my music,

401
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:18,894
that I'm very authentic.

402
00:14:18,927 --> 00:14:21,566
Well, you know,
you speak with a blaccent

403
00:14:21,599 --> 00:14:23,603
in your music,

404
00:14:23,637 --> 00:14:26,175
but you don't sound anything
like that right now.

405
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:29,916
I'm unfamiliar with the phrase
"blaccent." Um...

406
00:14:29,949 --> 00:14:31,920
I'm not offended by it.
I'm just‐‐ I'm, um...

407
00:14:31,953 --> 00:14:33,456
I just think that,

408
00:14:33,489 --> 00:14:36,930
if I was, like, really rapping
exactly how I'm talking,

409
00:14:36,963 --> 00:14:38,199
I'd be the only one
that sounded that way,

410
00:14:38,232 --> 00:14:39,969
and it'd look like I was, like,

411
00:14:40,002 --> 00:14:42,407
you know, making fun of everyone
else in the rap community,

412
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,277
being like, "Here's how I rap,

413
00:14:44,311 --> 00:14:46,950
and I'm going to get a java."

414
00:14:47,985 --> 00:14:49,087
So let me get this straight.

415
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:50,389
You're more concerned

416
00:14:50,423 --> 00:14:52,193
with offending
the hip‐hop community

417
00:14:52,227 --> 00:14:54,464
than you are the general public?

418
00:14:54,499 --> 00:14:55,968
No.

419
00:14:56,001 --> 00:14:57,972
I like, uh...
I'm very cause... al.

420
00:14:58,005 --> 00:14:58,974
I'm very causal.

421
00:14:59,007 --> 00:15:00,243
I...

422
00:15:00,276 --> 00:15:02,480
GH, for example.

423
00:15:02,515 --> 00:15:04,084
GH?

424
00:15:04,117 --> 00:15:05,486
Genital herpes.

425
00:15:05,521 --> 00:15:07,958
Um, 'cause I'm trying
to destigmatize it.

426
00:15:07,992 --> 00:15:09,629
There's a‐‐
there's a huge stigma.

427
00:15:09,662 --> 00:15:11,265
One in six people have it, and
it's like‐‐ people act like,

428
00:15:11,298 --> 00:15:13,102
if you have it,
it's the worst thing ever.

429
00:15:13,135 --> 00:15:14,505
And we don't hook up with people

430
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:16,241
and we make 'em feel
like lepers.

431
00:15:16,275 --> 00:15:17,678
It's like chicken pox.

432
00:15:17,711 --> 00:15:19,982
Do we, like, go up to kids
who have chicken pox

433
00:15:20,016 --> 00:15:22,320
and say, "Get out of here,
I'm not gonna suck you."

434
00:15:22,353 --> 00:15:24,291
Uh, I'm very...

435
00:15:24,324 --> 00:15:26,295
advocate...

436
00:15:26,328 --> 00:15:28,165
of all things.

437
00:15:28,199 --> 00:15:30,369
My mom sends me, like, a summary
of, like, the current events,

438
00:15:30,403 --> 00:15:33,042
because, like, CNN.com,
the format is just unbearable.

439
00:15:33,075 --> 00:15:34,311
I don't know
how people read that website.

440
00:15:34,344 --> 00:15:35,581
Like, get better art direction.

441
00:15:35,614 --> 00:15:36,716
And "wifebeater,"

442
00:15:36,749 --> 00:15:38,319
what an antiquated phrase
that is.

443
00:15:38,352 --> 00:15:41,258
It's like calling
a‐a sweatshirt a rapist, no?

444
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:43,730
‐(shuts off engine)
‐(grunts)

445
00:15:43,763 --> 00:15:46,268
Goddamn it.

446
00:15:46,301 --> 00:15:48,005
‐I'm sorry about that, Kareem.
‐My God.

447
00:15:48,038 --> 00:15:49,174
I would've ordered us
a bigger car,

448
00:15:49,207 --> 00:15:51,044
but, until Uber's unionized,

449
00:15:51,078 --> 00:15:53,315
I can't even consider something
like that. Drives me nuts.

450
00:15:53,349 --> 00:15:55,186
You know, I'm‐‐
It's claustrophobic, man.

451
00:15:55,219 --> 00:15:57,457
I don't like being in a place
where it's too small.

452
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,394
‐You know?
‐I hear you. Completely.
Maybe, on the way back,

453
00:15:59,427 --> 00:16:01,599
you could, like,
lie flat across the back.

454
00:16:01,633 --> 00:16:04,404
I don't know if the windows
being cracked helps or...

455
00:16:04,437 --> 00:16:06,676
Uh, hey,
would you mind giving me a hand?

456
00:16:06,709 --> 00:16:09,014
‐What?
‐Yeah. Just‐‐ I just...

457
00:16:09,047 --> 00:16:10,617
(grunts): Yeah. I know we were
in the middle or something,

458
00:16:10,651 --> 00:16:12,287
but...

459
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,057
just something
I've been doing lately

460
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:16,461
in terms of... raising, uh,

461
00:16:16,496 --> 00:16:19,067
funds and money
for the community.

462
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:22,173
If you want to roll in there, we
could, uh, surprise these kids.

463
00:16:22,207 --> 00:16:25,446
No, actually, I‐I have some,
uh, phone calls I have to make.

464
00:16:25,479 --> 00:16:26,783
You don't want to come in?

465
00:16:26,816 --> 00:16:28,452
I really got to make
these calls. You know...

466
00:16:28,485 --> 00:16:30,056
Okay. If you're worried
about them swarming you,

467
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:31,593
they're more
of an Anthony Davis community.

468
00:16:31,626 --> 00:16:33,329
Hi, Melanie. How you doing?

469
00:16:33,362 --> 00:16:34,565
DAVE:
All right.

470
00:16:34,599 --> 00:16:36,068
KAREEM:
Yeah.

471
00:16:36,101 --> 00:16:37,370
‐Exactly.
‐I'll be back in a few minutes.

472
00:16:37,403 --> 00:16:40,042
I wonder what your thoughts are
on that.

473
00:16:40,076 --> 00:16:41,513
ALLY:
And I know fundraising

474
00:16:41,546 --> 00:16:43,182
is never easy,

475
00:16:43,215 --> 00:16:44,519
but we live in L. A.!

476
00:16:44,552 --> 00:16:47,791
And while that has
its quirks, uh,

477
00:16:47,825 --> 00:16:50,062
it also has tons
of wealthy people.

478
00:16:50,096 --> 00:16:52,066
‐(chuckling)
‐Right?

479
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,637
But, seriously,
if anybody you know

480
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:55,774
who works in the arts
or in music...

Uh, let's... get in

487

‐Hi.

489
00:17:12,373 --> 00:17:14,277
There's pizza? Is there
buffalo chicken pizza here?

490
00:17:14,311 --> 00:17:16,348
I don't think, like,
a bank will accept one of these,

491
00:17:16,381 --> 00:17:20,524
so I do have a very legitimate,
real check right here.

Dave, I can't accept that.
I'm not‐‐

‐It's...
‐For the kids.

496

For the kids.

497

‐Thank you.
‐Sure.

498
00:17:30,711 --> 00:17:32,648
I've actually left out
the most important detail.

499
00:17:32,681 --> 00:17:36,188
Kareem Abdul‐Jabbar is outside
right now, in my car.

500
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:38,660
He's writing a profile on me.
If I brought him in,

501
00:17:38,693 --> 00:17:40,664
I'm pretty sure
that everyone's pockets would...

502
00:17:40,697 --> 00:17:42,367
So this is‐‐ You're doing this

503
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,639
because someone is writing
an article about you?

504
00:17:44,672 --> 00:17:47,243
‐That... makes sense.
‐No. I‐I'm doing it

505
00:17:47,277 --> 00:17:49,815
‐for you.
‐No, I‐I didn't ask for this.

506
00:17:49,849 --> 00:17:52,521
I'm‐I'm unhappy
that you did this.

507
00:17:52,554 --> 00:17:54,124
All I was trying to do is show

508
00:17:54,157 --> 00:17:56,529
a supportive gesture
of friendship.

509
00:17:56,562 --> 00:17:57,564
Dave, the other night,
when you came over,

510
00:17:57,598 --> 00:17:59,134
that‐that was the first time

511
00:17:59,167 --> 00:18:00,469
we've seen each other
in four months.

512
00:18:00,504 --> 00:18:02,741
Like, I would not qualify us
as friends.

513
00:18:02,775 --> 00:18:05,146
‐We should be.
‐Oh!

514
00:18:05,179 --> 00:18:06,415
We should be friends.
I don't understand.

515
00:18:06,448 --> 00:18:08,553
How long are we gonna not talk,
forever?

516
00:18:08,586 --> 00:18:11,158
Can't we just not f‐fuck
and, like... (stammers)

517
00:18:11,191 --> 00:18:13,295
‐...and, like, matter
to each other? Like...
‐Dave, if you took sex

518
00:18:13,329 --> 00:18:15,299
out of our relationship,

519
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:18,205
it doesn't just become
friendship all of a sudden.

520
00:18:18,238 --> 00:18:19,542
Okay? It would be me

521
00:18:19,575 --> 00:18:22,781
being your human
emotional support animal.

522
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:26,154
I didn't realize
sex was so impactful

523
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:28,425
‐in terms of‐‐ I'm just kidding.
‐Oh, my God.

524
00:18:28,459 --> 00:18:30,564
Okay, Al, I did not mean to have
this conversation right now.

525
00:18:30,597 --> 00:18:31,833
Like, I didn't mean
to do this at your work.

526
00:18:31,866 --> 00:18:32,835
I am sorry for that.

527
00:18:32,868 --> 00:18:34,605
What if you came over after work

528
00:18:34,639 --> 00:18:36,876
‐and we just, like, talked
about ever...
‐No. No.

529
00:18:36,909 --> 00:18:38,847
We're not gonna talk
because you want to talk.

530
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,853
This is all of the same shit
all over again.

531
00:18:41,886 --> 00:18:45,192
You're so self‐centered, still.

532
00:18:45,226 --> 00:18:47,598
(stammers)
This is exactly why,

533
00:18:47,631 --> 00:18:49,467
even when I‐‐ when I loved you,

534
00:18:49,502 --> 00:18:52,541
I did not like you.

535
00:18:54,411 --> 00:18:56,683
Uh... 'kay.

00:18:57,885 --> 00:18:59,755

more questions.

596
00:21:36,468 --> 00:21:37,871
Sure.

597
00:21:37,905 --> 00:21:40,710
Are you okay?

598
00:21:42,748 --> 00:21:44,819
Just write whatever
you want about me.

599
00:21:44,852 --> 00:21:46,856
I‐I can't be this person
for that,

600
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:48,793
and that person for this person.
It's...

601
00:21:48,827 --> 00:21:51,064
I am who I am, so...

602
00:21:51,097 --> 00:21:54,037
just call it how you see it.

603
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:57,410
Do you think
you're a good person?

604
00:22:00,115 --> 00:22:04,457
Honestly, my biggest fear is
that I'm not.

605
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:07,965
You know, I have
this constant vision

606
00:22:07,998 --> 00:22:10,069
where I'm dead,

607
00:22:10,102 --> 00:22:12,975
and I'm, like, floating up
to heaven or whatever,

608
00:22:13,008 --> 00:22:16,047
and I get there, and God's
laughing at me, and he's like,

609
00:22:16,081 --> 00:22:18,987
"Is that what you thought
the whole point of life was?"

610
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:22,728
Because I know
that I'm so singularly focused

611
00:22:22,761 --> 00:22:25,800
on this...
chasing my legacy type of thing

612
00:22:25,834 --> 00:22:28,706
and being this great artist
and all that, but it's, like,

613
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:31,044
obviously, that's not, like,
what life is about.

614
00:22:31,077 --> 00:22:32,948
But at the same time,

615
00:22:32,981 --> 00:22:36,087
if I don't give my all into
being that, I'll never be that,

616
00:22:36,121 --> 00:22:38,693
and I'll never figure out
my album.

617
00:22:38,726 --> 00:22:41,499
And I also see these DMs
from kids, and they're like,

618
00:22:41,532 --> 00:22:43,870
"Hey, Lil Dicky, I'm depressed,

619
00:22:43,903 --> 00:22:45,874
"and when I listen to
your music, I'm a little less,

620
00:22:45,907 --> 00:22:47,511
and, like, thank you for that."

621
00:22:47,544 --> 00:22:49,080
And, like, that really happens,

622
00:22:49,113 --> 00:22:51,084
and that's what
the point of life is, right,

623
00:22:51,117 --> 00:22:52,621
to, like, do good.

624
00:22:52,654 --> 00:22:54,457
And I feel like
the bigger I get,

625
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:56,662
the more good I can do,
so, it's, like, by my logic,

626
00:22:56,696 --> 00:22:58,967
the way that I can do
the most good on Earth is

627
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,071
by becoming the biggest artist
in the world, you know?

628
00:23:01,104 --> 00:23:02,908
Like, so I have to be selfish.

629
00:23:02,941 --> 00:23:06,181
It's my destiny or whatever.

630
00:23:06,214 --> 00:23:08,051
(laughs)

631
00:23:08,085 --> 00:23:09,855
Dave,

632
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:13,496
that's the most creative excuse
for being narcissistic

633
00:23:13,529 --> 00:23:14,798
I've ever heard.

634
00:23:14,832 --> 00:23:16,535
That's pretty good, though.
(laughs)

635
00:23:16,569 --> 00:23:19,474
Thanks. Well, I'm happy
you liked it. Uh...

636
00:23:19,508 --> 00:23:20,977
You're funny, boy,
I'll tell you that.

637
00:23:21,011 --> 00:23:23,415
I appreciate that.

638
00:23:23,448 --> 00:23:25,152
I got to use the restroom.
Where?

639
00:23:25,185 --> 00:23:27,991
It's over there.

640
00:23:29,728 --> 00:23:31,064
(door opens)

641
00:23:31,097 --> 00:23:32,601
‐(sighs)
‐(door closes)

642
00:23:32,634 --> 00:23:33,937
(door bangs open)

643
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:35,674
Mike, where the fuck
you at, bro?

644
00:23:35,707 --> 00:23:37,911
Mike, you got some explaining
to do, motherfucker!

645
00:23:37,945 --> 00:23:39,882
‐Whoa. Hey.
‐Mike, where you at?

646
00:23:39,915 --> 00:23:43,021
Mike, you red‐headed pussy,
where the fuck you at?

647
00:23:43,055 --> 00:23:45,025
‐Mike? Mike, where you at, bro?
‐Gata.

648
00:23:45,059 --> 00:23:46,629
‐Gata. Chill.
‐Man, you fucking
played me, dog.

649
00:23:46,662 --> 00:23:48,700
‐Shh. Kareem is here.
‐How you gonna do me like

650
00:23:48,733 --> 00:23:50,604
‐like that, bro? We supposed
to be boys, man.
‐Relax. Relax. Relax.

651
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:52,139
‐How you gonna prank me
like that, bro?
‐Kareem is here.

652
00:23:52,173 --> 00:23:54,177
‐Chill out. Gata, relax.
‐Come on. I trusted you, bro.

653
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:55,981
‐Hey.
‐Waste of my fucking time.
‐Gata, I had no idea that...

654
00:23:56,014 --> 00:23:56,983
‐MIKE: Gata.
‐GATA: Biggest chance to fame,
bro.

655
00:23:57,016 --> 00:23:58,720
DAVE:
Gata, stop.

656
00:23:58,753 --> 00:24:00,122
MIKE:
I didn't know they were
gonna prank you.

657
00:24:00,155 --> 00:24:01,926
‐GATA: They pranked me, bro.
‐MIKE: I know.

658
00:24:01,959 --> 00:24:03,228
‐They never fucking
told me, bro.
‐Hey, Dave?

659
00:24:03,261 --> 00:24:04,665
Is there something wrong
with your door?

660
00:24:04,698 --> 00:24:05,567
(indistinct,
overlapping chatter)

661
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,036
Hey, Dave, come on, man!

662
00:24:07,069 --> 00:24:09,240
I don't like being
in a small space like this!

663
00:24:09,273 --> 00:24:10,510
‐Stop. Stop.
‐Man, fuck all that, bro.

664
00:24:10,543 --> 00:24:11,812
This nigga's a buster, nigga.

665
00:24:11,846 --> 00:24:13,048
‐Relax. Relax. I had no idea.
‐Stop.

666
00:24:13,081 --> 00:24:14,083
‐I'm just their manager.
‐Stop. Stop.

667
00:24:14,117 --> 00:24:15,085
They don't tell me anything.

668
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:16,021
You're just whose manager?

669
00:24:16,054 --> 00:24:17,691
You didn't even tell him.

670
00:24:17,724 --> 00:24:19,093
No, I didn't, 'cause
I didn't have a chance to.

671
00:24:19,127 --> 00:24:20,797
I‐I'm... They're just
TikTok stars, and a...

672
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:22,199
‐He got a new client, bro.
‐It's a side project.

673
00:24:22,233 --> 00:24:23,803
It's not like
you're making music anyway.

674
00:24:23,836 --> 00:24:25,507
It's not gonna impact
our business at all.

675
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:27,043
What do you mean, it's not gonna
affect our business?

676
00:24:27,076 --> 00:24:28,145
Maybe if you weren't on TikTok,
I would have known

677
00:24:28,178 --> 00:24:28,980
Kareem was a fucking journal...

678
00:24:29,013 --> 00:24:29,948
(loud knocking)

679
00:24:29,982 --> 00:24:31,786
Is that door not fixed?

680
00:24:31,819 --> 00:24:33,923
First of all, Gata said he could
fix the door. I asked him...

681
00:24:33,956 --> 00:24:35,259
Hey, Kareem,
you having trouble in there?

682
00:24:35,292 --> 00:24:36,495
KAREEM:
What's going on with the door?

683
00:24:36,529 --> 00:24:37,798
Yeah, it's this, uh, knob thing.

684
00:24:37,831 --> 00:24:39,601
KAREEM:
Well, does it open or what?

685
00:24:39,635 --> 00:24:40,737
DAVE:
Try twisting it.

686
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:42,173
Let me out of here, man!

687
00:24:42,206 --> 00:24:45,245
(indistinct,
overlapping shouting)

688
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:46,816
‐Kareem, don't worry about it.
‐You're the one that said...

689
00:24:46,849 --> 00:24:48,653
How the fuck did you not
fix this door? Uh...

690
00:24:48,686 --> 00:24:49,955
He said he knew someone that
could fix the fucking door!

691
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:51,559
GATA:
I work for Dave, not for you.

692
00:24:51,592 --> 00:24:52,259
Kareem, I'm just gonna ram
in there, okay,

693
00:24:52,293 --> 00:24:53,763
so back up, Kareem.

694
00:24:53,796 --> 00:24:55,667
I asked one person
to fix the fucking door.

695
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,604
All of that is just
goddamn bullshit, bro.

696
00:24:57,637 --> 00:24:58,806
‐GATA: Come on, man.
‐Let me out.

697
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,875
GATA:
A real man ain't

698
00:24:59,908 --> 00:25:01,277
gonna walk away. Stay in here

699
00:25:01,311 --> 00:25:02,814
‐and talk about this shit, man.
‐No, dude.

700
00:25:02,848 --> 00:25:04,718
When you say you're gonna
do something...

701
00:25:04,752 --> 00:25:05,854
You're the one that said you're
gonna fix the fucking door.

702
00:25:05,887 --> 00:25:07,758
(indistinct chatter)

703
00:25:07,791 --> 00:25:09,928
‐(yells)
‐GATA: Trying to do shit
with that knife, bro.

704
00:25:09,962 --> 00:25:11,899
‐Hey, hey. What is going on?
‐Go put that fucking knife
down, bro.

705
00:25:11,932 --> 00:25:13,803
‐Hey, Ally.
‐Your rams are coming out...

706
00:25:13,836 --> 00:25:14,838
‐What the fuck is happening?
‐Back up.

707
00:25:14,872 --> 00:25:16,575
Kareem, I have a knife, and

708
00:25:16,609 --> 00:25:18,880
‐I'm gonna jimmy the door.
‐No! No!
‐(shouting)

709
00:25:18,913 --> 00:25:21,284
Stop! You're gonna hurt him!
Stop!

710
00:25:21,317 --> 00:25:23,656
No. My machine! My machine!

711
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:25,292
ALLY:
Oh.

712
00:25:25,325 --> 00:25:27,531
‐(Kareem groaning)
‐Uh...

713
00:25:27,564 --> 00:25:30,169
‐Oh, God! (groans)
‐(Dave whimpers)

714
00:25:30,202 --> 00:25:33,241
‐(groans, inhales sharply)
‐Oh, God. Ugh.

715
00:25:33,275 --> 00:25:34,945
‐KAREEM: Ow! (groans)
‐Oh, my God.

716
00:25:34,978 --> 00:25:36,649
Oh.

717
00:25:36,682 --> 00:25:37,984
It's okay. We're gonna call
the ambulance. Uh...

718
00:25:43,228 --> 00:25:44,297
‐(groans)
‐DAVE: Kicked in...
‐MIKE: The pressure

719
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:45,900
from the door‐‐ it snapped open,

720
00:25:45,934 --> 00:25:47,336
‐and then there was... blood.
‐Was blood.

721
00:25:47,369 --> 00:25:49,340
‐A lot of blood.
‐Uh, uh...

722
00:25:49,373 --> 00:25:52,012
I‐I don't know if he'll, like...
(sighs)

723
00:25:52,046 --> 00:25:53,315
MIKE:
There's no way he's gonna die.

724
00:25:53,348 --> 00:25:55,185
Right? There's no way
he gonna die.

725
00:25:55,219 --> 00:25:57,624
‐(phone chimes repeatedly)
‐BRODY: Yo, we got Gata.

726
00:25:57,657 --> 00:25:59,193
‐Fuck.
‐We got our boy Gata in here.

727
00:25:59,227 --> 00:26:00,997
We got a good prank
for you guys.

728
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:02,768
‐Yeah, bro. Yeah, bro.

‐What the hell?

731
00:26:06,174 --> 00:26:07,911
These followers crazy, bro.

732
00:26:07,944 --> 00:26:09,313
This shit nuts, boy.

733
00:26:09,347 --> 00:26:11,084
Damn.

734
00:26:11,117 --> 00:26:13,756
Hey, y'all, swipe up
on this video, man.

735
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:15,693
I just got pranked
by The Stone Twins.

736
00:26:15,727 --> 00:26:18,265
Make sure y'all tap in,
swipe up, share the video.

737

(garbled radio transmission)

738
00:26:23,676 --> 00:26:25,814
Hi. Uh...

739
00:26:25,847 --> 00:26:28,786
You forgot
to sign the check, so...

740
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:31,257
Oh. Okay. Sorry.

741
00:26:31,291 --> 00:26:35,700
How do I even...?
So tricky when it's not a big...

742
00:26:35,733 --> 00:26:37,804
Oh. Thank you.

743
00:26:37,838 --> 00:26:39,842
I will avoid your wound.

744
00:26:39,875 --> 00:26:41,377
‐(clears throat)
‐So,

745
00:26:41,411 --> 00:26:43,381
you're still just as mad at me?

746
00:26:43,415 --> 00:26:45,385
‐Yeah.
‐Okay.

747
00:26:45,419 --> 00:26:47,858
But it's not just that.

748
00:26:47,891 --> 00:26:50,095
I'm... (sighs)

749
00:26:50,129 --> 00:26:52,199
I really wasn't ready
to see you the other night,

750
00:26:52,233 --> 00:26:54,805
so I am upset at myself
for letting you in,

751
00:26:54,838 --> 00:26:56,709
but that's my...

752
00:26:56,742 --> 00:26:58,211
Are you‐you...?

753
00:26:58,245 --> 00:27:00,149
‐You're done, right?
‐Oh, yeah. Sorry.

754
00:27:00,182 --> 00:27:02,119
I was just intensely
listening to...

755
00:27:02,153 --> 00:27:03,823
Here you go.

756
00:27:03,856 --> 00:27:07,396
But that's my stuff,
and I‐I took it out on you,

757
00:27:07,429 --> 00:27:10,335
and I was mean,
and I'm sorry for that.

758
00:27:10,369 --> 00:27:12,808
Totally forgiven.
Don't even...

759
00:27:12,841 --> 00:27:15,345
But you can't ambush me
like that.

760
00:27:15,379 --> 00:27:17,349
‐No, I can't.
‐Like, the other day or today.

761
00:27:17,383 --> 00:27:18,986
‐Like...
‐I agree. I'm sorry. That was...

762
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,690
I really am sorry.

763
00:27:20,723 --> 00:27:24,363
'Cause, listen,
if we're gonna be friends, it...

764
00:27:24,397 --> 00:27:27,871
it's not gonna be this
only‐on‐Dave's‐terms thing.

765
00:27:27,904 --> 00:27:29,173
‐No, throw that...
‐Okay?

766
00:27:29,207 --> 00:27:30,910
‐It's a new...
‐New regime.

767
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:32,714
‐New regime.
‐You're the queen
of that regime.

768
00:27:32,747 --> 00:27:34,250
‐Yeah.
‐I will do whatever
you say, honestly,

769
00:27:34,283 --> 00:27:37,757
‐to make this friendship work.
‐Dave, this is $5,000.

770
00:27:37,791 --> 00:27:39,227
Oh, yeah. I tweaked the check.

771
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:40,697
‐Um...
‐(laughing): Are you trying

772
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:42,366
to buy my friendship?

773
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:44,838
Yeah, I was, and it worked.

774
00:27:44,872 --> 00:27:46,876
‐You know,
it's for the kids, so...
‐Thank you.

775
00:27:46,909 --> 00:27:48,779
‐...happy to...
‐No. Seriously.

776
00:27:48,813 --> 00:27:50,315
‐Oh.
‐Hey, I'm just gonna deal
with this real quick.

777
00:27:50,349 --> 00:27:52,253
‐Yeah. Is he gonna be okay?
‐Yeah. I don't know.

778
00:27:52,286 --> 00:27:53,756
I thought he was made of silk,

779
00:27:53,789 --> 00:27:55,994
but it's more like
uncooked pasta.

780
00:27:56,027 --> 00:27:57,463
‐(Kareem groans softly)
‐Okay.

781
00:27:57,497 --> 00:28:00,002
‐ALLY: Ugh.
‐Guys need a hand?

782
00:28:00,035 --> 00:28:02,373
No?

783
00:28:05,078 --> 00:28:07,049
(groans)

784
00:28:07,082 --> 00:28:09,821
Kareem, I am so sorry
that this happened.

785
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:11,157
I know the article's
the last thing on your mind,

786
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:12,426
but if you need me to...

787
00:28:12,459 --> 00:28:14,798
Hey, I'm not writing an article.

788
00:28:14,831 --> 00:28:15,900
No?

789
00:28:15,934 --> 00:28:18,071
You are not.

790
00:28:18,104 --> 00:28:19,775
I'm not...?

791
00:28:19,808 --> 00:28:21,712
Hey, man,
get‐get me out of here.

792
00:28:22,514 --> 00:28:24,818
Get me out of here, man.

793
00:28:24,851 --> 00:28:26,922
I'm not...

794
00:28:26,956 --> 00:28:30,295
