00:01:27,129 --> 00:01:29,548
When I was a child, I told my mother

3
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:32,759
I wanted to learn every planet
in the Galactic Empire...

4
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:37,890
beginning in the center
and moving out to Star's End.

5
00:01:39,183 --> 00:01:41,226
Each night, she told me stories.

6
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:46,190
I traveled light-years...

7
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:51,236
my mind expanding
to hold more and more worlds.

8
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:55,908
But I never reached Terminus.

9
00:01:56,992 --> 00:02:01,914
Straddling the farthest reaches
of civilization, unsettled by man...

10
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:04,416
it was the end.

11
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:14,676
And its story remained dark to me
until many years later.

12
00:02:15,928 --> 00:02:17,513
Until it became my story.

13
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:20,891
Until it became...

14
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:23,685
the only story.

15
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:53,048
- Don't do that.
- Sorry.

16
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:57,052
- Where are the others?
- We're meeting them at the fence.

17
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:58,136
We're a bit late.

18
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:02,057
Come on, guys.

19
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:14,027
- Gia!
- It's so rocky.

20
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:21,118
Shit.

21
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:24,204
A bishop's claw.

22
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:27,541
- Up-valley.
- We need to be real quiet.

23
00:03:33,422 --> 00:03:36,133
The null field starts all the way
up there. Near that rock.

24
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:40,304
They called it "the Vault."

25
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:42,097
All the colonists knew for certain

26
00:03:42,181 --> 00:03:45,100
was that it projected a field
designed to keep people away.

27
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:47,728
No one could breach it.

28
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,818
Right, you gonna go first?

29
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:56,445
I thought you were first?

30
00:03:57,571 --> 00:03:59,698
You go first
and put your marker past the rock,

31
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:02,367
- I'll let you touch my tit.
- Gia.

32
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:03,452
For one minute.

33
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:05,287
Ten seconds.

34
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,331
Or you can look at 'em both for 30.

35
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,499
Swear on your moon.

36
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:11,293
Four-sworn.

37
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:17,048
- You get nothing if you win.
- Get to watch him piss his pants.

38
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:21,303
He isn't gonna make it.

39
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:23,263
Come on, Keir.

40
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:51,667
Keir.

41
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,960
Are you okay?

42
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:56,588
- Your brother is an assclaw.
- Gia, stop laughing at him.

43
00:04:57,506 --> 00:05:00,592
- He's pathetic.
- I was almost there. I was close.

44
00:05:00,676 --> 00:05:01,802
Poly, where you going?

45
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:04,137
- Shit. Poly!
- Poly, come back!

46
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:06,390
- We don't have a deal.
- I know.

47
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:08,517
I wanna see the ghost.

48
00:05:12,563 --> 00:05:13,772
Okay.

49
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:39,756
Shit.

50
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:44,344
- Poly?
- He's not moving.

51
00:05:45,137 --> 00:05:46,638
Poly?

52
00:05:47,431 --> 00:05:50,017
- We gotta get help.
- What you standing there for then?

53
00:06:19,505 --> 00:06:21,381
They're all gone. Eat.

54
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:29,056
I saw the ghost.

55
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:30,307
You saw me.

56
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:32,726
Eat.

57
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,647
You should've turned back,
like your boy Keir.

58
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,566
People who've tried to get closer
have been hurt. Really.

59
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:40,817
You weren't.

60
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:43,195
You got the record and you're okay.

61
00:06:44,363 --> 00:06:45,364
Am I?

62
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:48,116
Your mark is so far,
no one's ever seen it.

63
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:52,204
That's because it doesn't exist.
And neither does the ghost.

64
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,753
When do you think it's going
to tell us what it is, Warden?

65
00:07:00,671 --> 00:07:01,755
Call me Salvor.

66
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:05,092
And you assume it cares anything about us?

67
00:07:06,218 --> 00:07:07,219
It doesn't.

68
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:12,599
It's not just people it keeps away.
It's everything. It's birds, insects.

69
00:07:12,683 --> 00:07:16,311
No one's ever gotten through
the null field, and no one ever will.

70
00:07:16,812 --> 00:07:20,399
It's warning us to stay away.
So stop tempting fate.

71
00:07:21,275 --> 00:07:23,193
Go. Be careful.

72
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:27,030
- There's a bishop's claw...
- Up-valley. I know.

73
00:07:32,703 --> 00:07:36,748
Salvor Hardin. Hober Mallow. The Mule.

74
00:07:36,832 --> 00:07:38,917
I would learn these names one day.

75
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:46,884
The heroes and villains
fighting for the salvation of mankind.

76
00:07:47,718 --> 00:07:49,553
But to understand our future,

77
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:52,806
we have to remember the past
and the ones who caused it all.

78
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:55,475
A mathematician.

79
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:57,477
A martyr.

80
00:07:57,978 --> 00:07:59,188
A murderer.

81
00:08:00,898 --> 00:08:05,027
And the most important player of all,
Hari Seldon.

82
00:08:15,204 --> 00:08:16,997
She'll be on her way soon.

83
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,047
It will all work out, Raych.

84
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,174
Everything is dying.

85
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:29,885
That doesn't mean it won't all work out.

86
00:08:30,761 --> 00:08:33,013
Do you ever wish there was another way?

87
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:34,597
Every day, son.

88
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,894
But this is the optimal time.

89
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:57,871
86,960,947.

90
00:08:58,956 --> 00:09:02,125
86,960,957.

91
00:09:02,918 --> 00:09:05,921
86,960,971.

92
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:09,299
- 86,960,987...
- It's time.

93
00:09:10,843 --> 00:09:14,054
Gaal? Are you ready?

94
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:17,391
Yes.

95
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:25,023
All my life, I looked out and dreamed
of being somewhere else.

96
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:28,235
Now I realize
how much I'll miss this view.

97
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:30,445
I have to remember it perfectly.

98
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:32,906
No, you don't.

99
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:36,159
We can petition the Seer priests.

100
00:09:37,286 --> 00:09:41,665
It's not too late for you to stop this.
It's not too late for you to stay.

101
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:42,791
No.

102
00:09:44,126 --> 00:09:46,128
There's no place for me here anymore, Mom.

103
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:49,006
I'll die if I stay here.

104
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:52,342
But on Trantor, I'll be safe.

105
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,845
Accepted.

106
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:58,891
Hold your head high.

107
00:10:19,995 --> 00:10:21,538
That's her.

108
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:34,384
They all hate me.
You don't hate me, do you?

109
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:37,721
Never, Gaal. I'll always love you.

110
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:45,812
My greatest joy.

111
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:31,358
Come with me.

112
00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:33,485
We'd be lost out there.

113
00:11:37,072 --> 00:11:38,156
Go.

114
00:11:44,663 --> 00:11:45,706
I love you.

115
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:48,584
Go, child.

116
00:12:37,341 --> 00:12:39,426
Beginning transfer sequence.

117
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:42,888
Please move to jumppods
and secure for travel.

118
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:49,353
Did you say something?

119
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:54,107
No. But I was going to ask if this was
your first time on an imperial jumpship.

120
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:57,903
Yes. It is. I'm a bit nervous.

121
00:12:57,986 --> 00:13:00,614
Just place your hand on the screen.

122
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:02,616
- And it will scan your metrics.
- Thank you.

123
00:13:05,244 --> 00:13:07,371
- Jerril.
- Gaal.

124
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:08,622
Synnax?

125
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:10,749
Picked up just a hint of it
in your accent.

126
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:12,459
You don't hear it much at the Core,

127
00:13:12,543 --> 00:13:14,795
but I travel near
the rim worlds sometimes.

128
00:13:15,587 --> 00:13:17,881
Whoever took the prayer stones out
did a great job.

129
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:20,801
You wouldn't see the scars
if you didn't know to look.

130
00:13:21,385 --> 00:13:23,178
Sorry if I overstepped.

131
00:13:23,262 --> 00:13:24,263
It doesn't screw me up,

132
00:13:24,346 --> 00:13:26,825
but some people come out of the jump
feeling a little hungover.

133
00:13:26,849 --> 00:13:28,559
I don't drink.

134
00:13:28,642 --> 00:13:31,562
My parents dove an algae farm,
and we woke up pretty early.

135
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:34,189
You're gonna sleep through this.
They make sure of it.

136
00:13:34,273 --> 00:13:36,775
They can't have the grav on
during the jump. I don't know why.

137
00:13:36,859 --> 00:13:38,944
Well, the grav generators
output a waveform

138
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:40,696
that corrupts the jumpdrive's ability

139
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:43,532
to plot fourth-dimensional points
at transdimensional speeds.

140
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:46,410
Why are you going to Trantor?

141
00:13:47,119 --> 00:13:49,204
I'm going to work with Hari Seldon.

142
00:13:49,913 --> 00:13:51,748
I won a math contest.

143
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:55,544
Wow. Hari Seldon. And you from Synnax.

144
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,213
It was a pretty big contest.

145
00:14:03,302 --> 00:14:07,097
Commencing jump in three, two, one.

146
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,500
How are you awake?

147
00:15:32,266 --> 00:15:34,434
It's a pity we have to sleep
through the jump.

148
00:15:35,185 --> 00:15:37,104
It's supposed to be quite the light show.

149
00:15:38,313 --> 00:15:39,815
But if you're not a Spacer,

150
00:15:39,898 --> 00:15:43,026
you can find your body and mind
taking different trips.

151
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,736
I slept through the whole thing.

152
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,697
...and prepare to disembark.

153
00:15:49,283 --> 00:15:50,450
Wow.

154
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:55,038
If the Empire is good for anything,
they can damn well build.

155
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,920
This is incredible.

156
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:43,754
Welcome to Trantor, the eye of the Empire.

157
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:50,302
Please respect and enjoy the peace.

158
00:16:58,101 --> 00:16:59,603
Are those soldiers?

159
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:03,232
Probably didn't make the news
on your world,

160
00:17:03,941 --> 00:17:06,944
some sort of kerfuffle
at the galaxy's edge,

161
00:17:07,027 --> 00:17:08,819
Anacreon and Thespis.

162
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:13,242
Imperial appraisers got caught
in the cross fire, so now it's a big deal.

163
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:19,790
Sponsor and contact?

164
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:23,335
Dr. Hari Seldon. Streeling University.

165
00:17:23,836 --> 00:17:25,712
Expected return to home planet?

166
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:30,592
I'm not going back. This is my home now.

167
00:17:30,676 --> 00:17:35,097
Any car on the stalk.
Please respect and enjoy the peace.

168
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,181
Thank you.

169
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:41,770
Now that I know you a little better,

170
00:17:42,396 --> 00:17:44,731
I won't waste my breath
explaining everything.

171
00:17:44,815 --> 00:17:46,024
This part is great though.

172
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,570
Please make your way to any available car.

173
00:17:50,445 --> 00:17:53,991
This car will commence
its descent down the stalk momentarily.

174
00:17:54,575 --> 00:17:56,243
I'm gonna stay awake the whole ride.

175
00:17:56,326 --> 00:17:57,327
Me too.

176
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:23,437
It takes 14 hours to drop from
Trantor Station to the planet's surface.

177
00:18:25,731 --> 00:18:28,317
Although, technically,
it's not the surface.

178
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:32,237
Billions of citizens spend their lives
beneath Trantor's outer shell,

179
00:18:33,155 --> 00:18:36,158
toiling away on
a hundred subterranean levels

180
00:18:36,241 --> 00:18:38,994
without ever seeing the sun or the stars.

181
00:18:48,295 --> 00:18:51,882
Whatever remained of the natural world
belonged to the Emperors.

182
00:18:53,258 --> 00:18:54,384
Dawn.

183
00:18:55,093 --> 00:18:56,094
Day.

184
00:18:57,471 --> 00:18:58,472
Dusk.

185
00:19:00,265 --> 00:19:02,017
The Genetic Dynasty.

186
00:19:02,601 --> 00:19:06,813
Clones of Cleon I,
decanted at different ages.

187
00:19:21,745 --> 00:19:23,163
Master Orlio.

188
00:19:24,248 --> 00:19:25,415
Empire.

189
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:27,918
How long have you worked for us?

190
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:30,170
Sixty-eight privileged years, Empire.

191
00:19:31,463 --> 00:19:33,757
Started cleaning the Mural when I was 12.

192
00:19:33,841 --> 00:19:36,927
Gone from one end to the other
four times over since then.

193
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:39,388
Know every grain of chroma by heart now.

194
00:19:39,471 --> 00:19:44,434
Tell me, are there some colors
more resistant to cleaning than others?

195
00:19:45,102 --> 00:19:46,103
Plum.

196
00:19:46,687 --> 00:19:47,688
Periwinkle.

197
00:19:48,605 --> 00:19:51,567
Saffron is a particularly
truculent pigment.

198
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:55,529
What about crimson? Is crimson truculent?

199
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,281
Empire?

200
00:19:57,364 --> 00:19:58,574
It's come to our attention

201
00:19:58,657 --> 00:20:02,411
that a tract authored by Hari Seldon
was discovered in your quarters.

202
00:20:02,494 --> 00:20:04,955
Apologies, Empire. It was foolish of me.

203
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:06,290
It's just that I'd...

204
00:20:06,373 --> 00:20:09,960
Heard whispers of his proclamations
and were curious.

205
00:20:11,253 --> 00:20:14,965
They refer to Seldon
as "the Raven," don't they?

206
00:20:16,592 --> 00:20:20,262
I hear he's rather critical
of the Imperium.

207
00:20:20,345 --> 00:20:24,516
Well, I'm happy to report
that his words are baseless trash,

208
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,643
and atrociously written, if I might add.

209
00:20:26,727 --> 00:20:30,147
Nevertheless,
the man has amassed a following.

210
00:20:30,689 --> 00:20:35,611
People who hinge their hopes
on every word Raven Seldon utters.

211
00:20:37,112 --> 00:20:40,699
Words have a way
of fanning into wildfires, Orlio.

212
00:20:40,782 --> 00:20:42,826
I am loyal, Empire. I would never...

213
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:46,872
I know you won't, which is why
I broached this subject in person.

214
00:20:47,456 --> 00:20:48,749
Empire...

215
00:20:58,467 --> 00:21:01,345
What are your lessons this morning,
Brother Dawn?

216
00:21:02,179 --> 00:21:03,847
The Outer Reach kingdoms.

217
00:21:03,931 --> 00:21:06,558
I learned an old Anacreon song
about hunting.

218
00:21:06,642 --> 00:21:10,938
Well, there is much truth in music.

219
00:21:11,939 --> 00:21:15,651
A boy bleeds a fawn with a knife
and then takes shelter in her coat.

220
00:21:15,734 --> 00:21:17,694
That one's not really a hunting song.

221
00:21:17,778 --> 00:21:20,405
That's a dirty song
about a boy's first time with a woman.

222
00:21:23,867 --> 00:21:26,995
Play it back in your mind.
And don't confuse the two.

223
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:29,957
Brother Day, please leave
the peacock to the cooks.

224
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,668
You'll be no less fascinating
to your biographers.

225
00:21:32,751 --> 00:21:35,212
Brother Dusk imagines
I do this to be colorful.

226
00:21:35,796 --> 00:21:38,966
And Brother Day puts more
words in my mouth than he does poultry.

227
00:21:39,049 --> 00:21:40,425
It's the lard.

228
00:21:40,509 --> 00:21:43,887
The cooks inject it under the skin
with a needle right before roasting.

229
00:21:43,971 --> 00:21:46,849
- Do you know why they use a needle?
- Because it's efficient?

230
00:21:46,932 --> 00:21:49,017
Because they're afraid
if they use a knife,

231
00:21:49,101 --> 00:21:51,019
as is the time-honored way,

232
00:21:51,103 --> 00:21:54,857
they might rip the skin, and I'll send
them to a stew-pot stall 50 levels down.

233
00:21:55,607 --> 00:21:59,403
All of which is a problem. Why?

234
00:21:59,486 --> 00:22:02,698
Because when people are afraid
to do their job right,

235
00:22:03,198 --> 00:22:05,117
they're certain to do it wrong.

236
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,370
- That's poor stewardship.
- It's poor roast peacock.

237
00:22:10,038 --> 00:22:12,291
Not everything is a teachable moment.

238
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:14,459
Empire.

239
00:22:14,543 --> 00:22:15,711
Demerzel.

240
00:22:15,794 --> 00:22:18,797
The delegations from Thespis
and Anacreon are arriving.

241
00:22:18,881 --> 00:22:21,008
- How did they seem?
- Peevish.

242
00:22:21,717 --> 00:22:25,679
Barbarian kingdoms.
They're more trouble than they're worth.

243
00:22:26,889 --> 00:22:30,142
Have Outer Reach Trade bring
tariff projections to the residence.

244
00:22:31,351 --> 00:22:34,271
Dress nice. Have someone brush your hair.

245
00:22:35,397 --> 00:22:37,774
It's not the most important thing
we'll do this week,

246
00:22:37,858 --> 00:22:41,403
but it's the most important thing
they'll do in their lifetime.

247
00:23:01,131 --> 00:23:05,636
Anacreon and Thespis.
Observe the mannerisms of each party.

248
00:23:13,769 --> 00:23:16,396
They hate each other.

249
00:23:18,065 --> 00:23:21,777
Their enmity is legendary.
But war is expensive.

250
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:24,821
And so we have called them
onto the carpet to broker a peace.

251
00:23:38,836 --> 00:23:40,212
Thanks for the company.

252
00:23:40,295 --> 00:23:43,674
Good luck with the new job.
I hope Hari Seldon is worth the trip.

253
00:23:43,757 --> 00:23:45,133
Thanks.

254
00:23:50,055 --> 00:23:51,139
Cute.

255
00:23:54,643 --> 00:23:57,229
Raych, Raych, Raych. Where are you?

256
00:24:03,735 --> 00:24:05,696
- That's me.
- What?

257
00:24:06,405 --> 00:24:07,739
That's me, Raych.

258
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:13,287
I work for Hari. Dr. Seldon.

259
00:24:14,162 --> 00:24:16,206
- Baggage Claim is this way.
- No.

260
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:18,834
No. This is all I have.

261
00:24:19,668 --> 00:24:20,669
Okay.

262
00:24:21,461 --> 00:24:23,422
Then the rest of planet is this way.

263
00:24:27,926 --> 00:24:29,970
It's supposed to be a perfect replica.

264
00:24:30,596 --> 00:24:32,598
Not that we'd know under the outer shell.

265
00:24:33,098 --> 00:24:36,226
Half of level 64 is just
servers running skies.

266
00:24:39,396 --> 00:24:42,065
Is there still a Seer church
here on Trantor?

267
00:24:42,566 --> 00:24:45,611
Down there, I think. Level 22.

268
00:24:48,447 --> 00:24:49,740
I'd like to see it.

269
00:24:52,201 --> 00:24:53,202
What?

270
00:24:54,745 --> 00:24:55,996
Sorry, I've...

271
00:24:57,664 --> 00:25:00,000
I've never met anyone from Synnax before.

272
00:25:09,426 --> 00:25:12,262
An expression
of compassion and stewardship,

273
00:25:12,346 --> 00:25:14,723
the Mural of Souls,

274
00:25:14,806 --> 00:25:18,685
worked on every day by the senior member
of the Genetic Dynasty.

275
00:25:18,769 --> 00:25:23,357
The Mural depicts the four-century age
of peace and the Galactic Family.

276
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,069
Notice the active chroma?
How the pigment subtly moves?

277
00:25:33,116 --> 00:25:35,077
Provincial Ambassador Xandem.

278
00:25:36,578 --> 00:25:39,665
Do you have a question or a comment
about the Mural?

279
00:25:40,457 --> 00:25:44,336
We were just marveling
at the Empire's benevolent reach.

280
00:25:44,837 --> 00:25:46,296
For it is a marvel.

281
00:25:49,091 --> 00:25:52,678
86,963,537.

282
00:25:52,761 --> 00:25:55,973
86,963,549.

283
00:25:56,056 --> 00:25:59,434
86,963,563.

284
00:25:59,518 --> 00:26:02,855
963,567.

285
00:26:03,355 --> 00:26:07,067
86,963,573...

286
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:10,195
- Are you praying?
- No. Why?

287
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:12,573
Your lips were moving.

288
00:26:12,656 --> 00:26:15,492
Yeah. When I'm nervous, I count primes.

289
00:26:22,332 --> 00:26:23,917
Hari said you'd wanna see this.

290
00:26:46,023 --> 00:26:49,193
Gaal, meet Hari.

291
00:26:51,904 --> 00:26:53,155
Dr. Seldon.

292
00:26:54,281 --> 00:26:57,409
I am so honored you invited me here.

293
00:26:57,910 --> 00:26:59,745
What did you think
of the Imperial Library?

294
00:26:59,828 --> 00:27:02,748
It's amazing. So many books in one place.

295
00:27:02,831 --> 00:27:05,751
I imagine books were hard
to come by on Synnax.

296
00:27:07,044 --> 00:27:08,921
Please, sit.

297
00:27:15,427 --> 00:27:18,847
So, you know
Kalle's Ninth Proof of Folding?

298
00:27:19,473 --> 00:27:22,392
Yes, I couldn't have solved
Abraxas without it.

299
00:27:22,476 --> 00:27:26,855
No one else thought to use it.
Not in 500 years.

300
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:29,274
Why do you think that is?

301
00:27:30,234 --> 00:27:32,778
Kalle's writing is poetic.

302
00:27:32,861 --> 00:27:36,198
It's beautiful, but it's hard to imagine
there's any rigor there.

303
00:27:36,949 --> 00:27:39,409
So serious scholars don't read her.

304
00:27:41,995 --> 00:27:43,080
Why did you?

305
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:46,917
I went to Kalle
for the rhythm of the words at first.

306
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,502
I missed the math.

307
00:27:49,002 --> 00:27:51,255
But when I read between the lines,

308
00:27:51,338 --> 00:27:54,007
I realized she was proposing
a radical theory

309
00:27:54,091 --> 00:27:57,177
about rings of integers
in non-Archimedean local fields.

310
00:27:57,261 --> 00:27:58,762
Indeed she was.

311
00:28:00,055 --> 00:28:01,515
It does make me wonder, though,

312
00:28:01,598 --> 00:28:06,436
how you've managed to stumble across
Kalle's Ninth Proof in the first place,

313
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,021
given where you were.

314
00:28:10,649 --> 00:28:15,112
This isn't Synnax, Gaal.
Curiosity isn't a crime here.

315
00:28:16,113 --> 00:28:17,322
I was lonely.

316
00:28:18,532 --> 00:28:21,076
Almost no one there
thought like I thought.

317
00:28:22,244 --> 00:28:25,080
But math doesn't take sides.
It doesn't judge.

318
00:28:25,581 --> 00:28:31,128
I imagine you were lonely,
a mind like yours in a place like that.

319
00:28:38,635 --> 00:28:43,557
Kalle's original proof manuscript.
Written in her native Thraxian.

320
00:29:00,616 --> 00:29:02,784
They're going to arrest me tomorrow.
And you.

321
00:29:02,868 --> 00:29:04,995
- What?
- It's almost a certainty.

322
00:29:05,078 --> 00:29:06,663
Arrest? Why?

323
00:29:06,747 --> 00:29:11,210
There's a nonzero chance it won't happen.
But it's not a number worth discussing.

324
00:29:12,211 --> 00:29:13,837
No. This has to be a mistake.

325
00:29:13,921 --> 00:29:16,715
People lie, Gaal. Numbers don't.

326
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:19,176
Are you familiar with my work?
Psychohistory?

327
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,560
- Every mathematician has read your...
- Do you agree with the concept?

328
00:29:22,638 --> 00:29:25,015
In theory. But I don't know
what it has to do with...

329
00:29:25,098 --> 00:29:26,391
It's not a theory.

330
00:29:26,475 --> 00:29:29,645
It's the destiny of the human race
expressed in numbers.

331
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:31,897
And it's the reason
the Empire will take us.

332
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,774
They're worried
you can predict the future.

333
00:29:33,857 --> 00:29:37,986
They're worried people believe I can.
And they don't like the future I predict.

334
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:39,154
Which is what?

335
00:29:42,449 --> 00:29:45,577
Trantor is going to be destroyed.
The Empire will fall.

336
00:29:45,661 --> 00:29:48,914
You understand, these aren't things
I'm anxious to tell people.

337
00:29:48,997 --> 00:29:50,457
It's just what the math tells me.

338
00:29:50,541 --> 00:29:54,920
Why let me come all this way
just to arrest me?

339
00:29:55,003 --> 00:29:57,756
That's a good question. You tell me.

340
00:30:29,997 --> 00:30:31,790
Because I solved Abraxas.

341
00:30:32,708 --> 00:30:35,043
They think I'm the only one
who can prove you wrong.

342
00:30:35,127 --> 00:30:38,088
And you are, if I was. But I'm not.

343
00:30:39,256 --> 00:30:41,633
Did you know all this
when you were showing me the sights?

344
00:30:41,717 --> 00:30:43,927
There's more at stake here
than you can imagine, Gaal.

345
00:30:46,138 --> 00:30:48,473
I risked my life coming here.

346
00:30:49,057 --> 00:30:52,269
And now you want me to risk it again
just to support your numbers?

347
00:30:52,352 --> 00:30:55,105
That's not entirely accurate, is it, Gaal?

348
00:30:55,189 --> 00:30:57,774
You left Synnax
one step ahead of arrest yourself.

349
00:30:57,858 --> 00:31:00,694
So you know math is never just numbers.

350
00:31:00,777 --> 00:31:03,113
In the wrong hands, it's a weapon.

351
00:31:03,947 --> 00:31:07,201
In the right hands, deliverance.

352
00:31:11,079 --> 00:31:12,206
Go.

353
00:31:14,249 --> 00:31:15,250
Get some sleep.

354
00:31:15,918 --> 00:31:18,670
It should take them most of the night
to divine your hotel.

355
00:31:18,754 --> 00:31:19,755
We'll talk soon.

356
00:31:21,882 --> 00:31:24,051
I know it's not the prize
you came here for...

357
00:31:25,594 --> 00:31:26,970
but it will have to do.

358
00:31:27,054 --> 00:31:29,473
- I can't keep this.
- Of course you can.

359
00:31:29,556 --> 00:31:34,978
This building will burn one day.
Stealing is a mercy.

360
00:31:50,452 --> 00:31:52,579
I've read all his work, psychohistory.

361
00:31:52,663 --> 00:31:55,707
I just never imagined
he'd use it this way.

362
00:31:55,791 --> 00:31:58,752
The Empire isn't gonna hurt you.
They need you.

363
00:31:58,836 --> 00:32:00,838
You don't know that. And neither does he.

364
00:32:00,921 --> 00:32:01,922
- Gaal...
- No.

365
00:32:02,005 --> 00:32:04,216
You haven't seen it.

366
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:07,302
When a planet wants you dead, you die.

367
00:32:09,179 --> 00:32:12,808
Ambassador Xandem,
Planet Anacreon, Outer Reach.

368
00:32:16,061 --> 00:32:17,312
Empire.

369
00:32:21,817 --> 00:32:25,320
Carved from the oldest tree
in the Tallyn Forest.

370
00:32:25,946 --> 00:32:27,698
The same wood used to carve the bow

371
00:32:27,781 --> 00:32:30,909
of Anacreon's greatest hunter,
Larken Keaen.

372
00:32:31,493 --> 00:32:33,036
Thank you, Ambassador.

373
00:32:34,454 --> 00:32:36,290
Did you enjoy the Mural of Souls?

374
00:32:36,373 --> 00:32:40,169
Yes, Empire.
I have never seen anything like it.

375
00:32:41,503 --> 00:32:45,465
Honored Diplomat Shae Un Shae,
Planet Thespis, Outer Reach.

376
00:32:49,344 --> 00:32:50,721
Empire.

377
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,725
A Thespin Book of Ablution.

378
00:32:55,309 --> 00:32:59,563
The filigree was recently smithed
to honor the imperial peace.

379
00:33:00,397 --> 00:33:02,816
Thank you, Honored Diplomat.

380
00:33:03,859 --> 00:33:07,321
And thank you, both delegations,
for making the journey to Trantor.

381
00:33:08,405 --> 00:33:09,615
Not that you had a choice.

382
00:33:11,825 --> 00:33:15,537
For nine centuries, the Anthor Belt
Agreement served your planets well.

383
00:33:15,621 --> 00:33:18,123
Last year,
Thespis identified a rogue asteroid,

384
00:33:18,207 --> 00:33:22,002
which they believe drifted
from the area governed by the agreement.

385
00:33:23,337 --> 00:33:25,047
We took no official position.

386
00:33:26,507 --> 00:33:28,258
Just our 10%.

387
00:33:28,842 --> 00:33:32,513
Anacreon believes
Thespis acts in bad faith.

388
00:33:32,596 --> 00:33:37,768
The Empire believes
imperial blood has been shed

389
00:33:37,851 --> 00:33:41,313
on a cold rock 50,000 light-years
from home.

390
00:33:46,777 --> 00:33:50,572
For any of these three beliefs,
a thousand wars have been fought.

391
00:33:51,365 --> 00:33:54,910
The next days will determine
if there will be another.

392
00:33:57,621 --> 00:34:01,542
Respect and enjoy the peace.

393
00:34:01,625 --> 00:34:04,711
Respect and enjoy the peace.

394
00:34:17,349 --> 00:34:20,726
Brother Dawn, what do you make of that?

395
00:34:20,811 --> 00:34:23,397
The Thespins want to remind you

396
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:27,025
how important the Anthor Belt asteroids
are to their religion.

397
00:34:27,109 --> 00:34:29,987
But look there. In the metal filigree.

398
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:33,197
The pattern in the sigil
is made of heavy palladium.

399
00:34:33,282 --> 00:34:36,994
The metal from the rogue asteroid.
How much would you say of the sigil?

400
00:34:37,077 --> 00:34:41,206
- Maybe a fifth of it?
- Closer to a quarter.

401
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:45,210
Currently, the Thespins tithe 10%
of the mined ore to us.

402
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:47,337
This is their way of quietly saying

403
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:50,799
they'll go all the way to 25%
if we side with them.

404
00:34:50,882 --> 00:34:55,469
There's no metal here at all.
Not even in the arrow tips.

405
00:34:56,054 --> 00:34:58,974
That's right. Why?

406
00:34:59,057 --> 00:35:01,476
The Anacreons need palladium.

407
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,978
They have none.

408
00:35:03,061 --> 00:35:07,441
It's like the hunting song.
It's not at all about hunting.

409
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:12,946
Art is simply politics' sweeter tongue.

410
00:35:13,822 --> 00:35:17,034
The customs of the Outer Reach
may seem idiosyncratic.

411
00:35:17,784 --> 00:35:22,206
But our attention to detail
is how we maintain the peace.

412
00:35:22,289 --> 00:35:26,126
And if the people step out of line,
we hit them with a big stick.

413
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:27,419
Thank you.

414
00:35:32,257 --> 00:35:34,885
Seldon and the girl.

415
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:38,597
Don't overthink the stick.

416
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:43,143
The Seer church. Do we have time?

417
00:35:46,104 --> 00:35:47,105
Yeah.

418
00:35:54,571 --> 00:35:57,449
She can sit. He will stand.

419
00:35:58,408 --> 00:36:00,494
But he will need to disarm.

420
00:36:07,668 --> 00:36:09,336
The heretic and I will talk.

421
00:36:18,762 --> 00:36:19,847
Upon awakening...

422
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:21,974
Upon awakening...

423
00:36:22,057 --> 00:36:23,809
We speak the words.

424
00:36:23,892 --> 00:36:25,978
And the words make us seen.

425
00:36:26,061 --> 00:36:27,688
Do you know who I am?

426
00:36:28,814 --> 00:36:32,484
I know that she has torn
the Sleeper's words from her face

427
00:36:32,568 --> 00:36:34,736
and can't be seen by God.

428
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:36,572
But do you know who I am?

429
00:36:36,655 --> 00:36:39,074
She has solved
one of life's ancient puzzles

430
00:36:39,157 --> 00:36:41,410
and cheapened the worth of life
in the solving.

431
00:36:41,493 --> 00:36:43,537
Of course I know.

432
00:36:46,206 --> 00:36:50,627
On Synnax, she is almost as famous
as her new god, Seldon.

433
00:36:50,711 --> 00:36:53,630
- He's not a god.
- No, he is not.

434
00:36:55,007 --> 00:37:00,220
He will die as all men like him die,
unseen by God.

435
00:37:00,304 --> 00:37:04,099
As will his followers. As will she.

436
00:37:05,767 --> 00:37:08,896
Gaal Dornick. I'll say this once,

437
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:15,652
because I am the highest-ranking and
only Seer priest on this forsaken world.

438
00:37:17,196 --> 00:37:20,866
If you are in trouble, I can help you.

439
00:37:23,744 --> 00:37:25,162
Is that what you want?

440
00:37:51,438 --> 00:37:52,981
You want me to stay?

441
00:37:53,065 --> 00:37:54,816
Will that stop them from arresting me?

442
00:37:55,317 --> 00:37:56,360
No.

443
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:58,278
I'll be all right.

444
00:37:59,112 --> 00:38:00,948
- I'll see you.
- Will you?

445
00:38:01,448 --> 00:38:02,866
Of course.

446
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:44,449
Some like to pray one last time.

447
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:46,535
Did you?

448
00:38:47,744 --> 00:38:48,787
No.

449
00:39:34,374 --> 00:39:36,084
What did you make of her?

450
00:39:36,668 --> 00:39:38,462
They haven't gotten to her yet.

451
00:39:38,545 --> 00:39:39,630
Yet.

452
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:41,632
What do you make of her?

453
00:39:41,715 --> 00:39:44,885
She solved Abraxas on her own.
I'm sure of that.

454
00:39:46,178 --> 00:39:50,349
As for the other question,
well, we shall see.

455
00:40:41,358 --> 00:40:43,318
My name's Lors Avakim.

456
00:40:43,402 --> 00:40:44,987
Hari sent me.

457
00:40:46,572 --> 00:40:47,573
Where is he?

458
00:40:49,032 --> 00:40:51,910
Arrested. As he predicted.

459
00:40:52,828 --> 00:40:54,913
You've both been charged
with high treason,

460
00:40:54,997 --> 00:40:57,708
conspiracy to destabilize the Imperium.

461
00:40:59,001 --> 00:41:00,586
This is a nightmare.

462
00:41:00,669 --> 00:41:04,840
Hari wants you to know how sorry he is
for involving you in this.

463
00:41:04,923 --> 00:41:06,091
It's not his fault.

464
00:41:10,512 --> 00:41:11,722
Is it?

465
00:41:12,764 --> 00:41:14,308
We can speak freely now.

466
00:41:15,184 --> 00:41:17,769
Once the Imperium learned
of Hari's conclusions,

467
00:41:17,853 --> 00:41:20,522
they made no secret
of trying to disrupt the project.

468
00:41:20,606 --> 00:41:24,193
Did Hari bring me here as bait?
Because I can prove him wrong?

469
00:41:24,276 --> 00:41:26,236
He's not wrong, Ms. Dornick.

470
00:41:27,196 --> 00:41:29,406
But yes on the bait part.

471
00:41:50,135 --> 00:41:51,512
Are you all right?

472
00:41:51,595 --> 00:41:55,390
The hook hurts,
but I'm trying not to wriggle too much.

473
00:41:59,102 --> 00:42:00,312
All rise.

474
00:42:06,068 --> 00:42:10,197
The tribunal of Cleon XII is convened.

475
00:42:11,448 --> 00:42:16,870
Your Exalted, the offenders,
Dr. Hari Seldon and Gaal Dornick,

476
00:42:17,538 --> 00:42:21,250
are accused of crimes so grave
that they threaten not just Trantor

477
00:42:21,333 --> 00:42:23,544
but the entire galaxy's existence.

478
00:42:24,336 --> 00:42:27,464
I will prove that Dr. Seldon
and his followers

479
00:42:27,548 --> 00:42:31,301
engaged in a conspiracy designed
to destroy the confidence in our empire.

480
00:42:34,596 --> 00:42:37,182
Dr. Seldon. Will you rise?

481
00:42:37,891 --> 00:42:40,519
You hail from the world of Helicon, yes?

482
00:42:40,602 --> 00:42:41,812
Yes.

483
00:42:41,895 --> 00:42:44,398
Will you state your current position
here on Trantor?

484
00:42:44,481 --> 00:42:48,402
I'm a professor of probability theory
at Streeling University.

485
00:42:49,444 --> 00:42:53,031
Specifically, the area of psychohistory.

486
00:42:53,115 --> 00:42:54,825
Define that for us, please.

487
00:42:54,908 --> 00:42:58,579
Psychohistory is a predictive model

488
00:42:58,662 --> 00:43:04,209
designed to forecast the behavior
of very large populations.

489
00:43:04,293 --> 00:43:09,256
In plainspoken terms, you claim
to be able to predict the future?

490
00:43:09,339 --> 00:43:12,801
Well, I don't know
what you're going to have for dinner,

491
00:43:12,885 --> 00:43:14,261
if that's what you're asking.

492
00:43:14,344 --> 00:43:15,929
You know what I'm asking.

493
00:43:16,013 --> 00:43:18,807
The Galactic Empire comprises
some eight trillion individuals.

494
00:43:18,891 --> 00:43:21,810
Would you say that was a large enough
sample to make a prediction?

495
00:43:21,894 --> 00:43:22,895
It is.

496
00:43:22,978 --> 00:43:26,231
And do you have a prediction
for that particular sample?

497
00:43:28,775 --> 00:43:29,776
I do.

498
00:43:32,321 --> 00:43:33,655
Indulge us.

499
00:43:33,739 --> 00:43:38,118
Trantor and the Galactic Empire
will lie in ruins within five centuries.

500
00:43:40,204 --> 00:43:41,622
Silence, brethren.

501
00:43:41,705 --> 00:43:45,876
Accepting your statement for the moment,
can you prove it's true?

502
00:43:46,418 --> 00:43:50,255
Only to another mathematician
conversant in ordinal analysis.

503
00:43:52,341 --> 00:43:53,634
How convenient.

504
00:43:54,301 --> 00:43:58,180
Your truths are so esoteric they escape
the grasp of nearly every citizen.

505
00:43:58,263 --> 00:44:00,891
They're not my truths.
They belong to science.

506
00:44:00,974 --> 00:44:05,229
The Imperium is 12,000 years old, Doctor.

507
00:44:05,312 --> 00:44:11,652
Are we really to believe
that it could be gone in just 500?

508
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:14,154
- Maybe quicker.
- Quicker?

509
00:44:14,238 --> 00:44:19,785
A rotten tree trunk appears strong
until the storm breaks it in two.

510
00:44:20,285 --> 00:44:23,330
Consider recent events in the Outer Reach.

511
00:44:23,413 --> 00:44:25,165
We're not here to consider any other...

512
00:44:25,249 --> 00:44:26,667
But you must!

513
00:44:28,669 --> 00:44:30,337
The Empire will fall.

514
00:44:31,129 --> 00:44:33,215
Order will vanish.

515
00:44:33,298 --> 00:44:35,926
Interstellar wars will be endless.

516
00:44:36,009 --> 00:44:40,597
Ten thousand worlds reduced
to radioactive cinders.

517
00:44:41,390 --> 00:44:44,476
Nothing we do can prevent this.

518
00:44:45,227 --> 00:44:50,232
This... period of barbarism.

519
00:44:52,276 --> 00:44:54,111
How long do you claim it will last?

520
00:44:54,194 --> 00:44:56,363
Thirty thousand years, Advocate.

521
00:44:57,781 --> 00:45:01,910
I submit to the court
that Dr. Seldon's "predictions"

522
00:45:01,994 --> 00:45:05,122
are actually intended
to destroy public confidence.

523
00:45:05,706 --> 00:45:08,041
I'm not a revolutionary.

524
00:45:08,125 --> 00:45:09,960
Well, then what are you?

525
00:45:10,627 --> 00:45:12,838
You've already said
the future cannot be changed.

526
00:45:12,921 --> 00:45:17,509
So what exactly is the purpose
of your project?

527
00:45:18,218 --> 00:45:21,096
I'm trying to soften the fall.

528
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:26,185
It cannot be prevented,

529
00:45:26,268 --> 00:45:29,897
this mass of events rushing to meet us.

530
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:33,650
But we can shorten
the dark ages that follow.

531
00:45:33,734 --> 00:45:34,943
How much?

532
00:45:36,236 --> 00:45:39,573
If we embrace your plan, how much?

533
00:45:40,324 --> 00:45:44,286
We should be in the dark
for a thousand years, Advocate.

534
00:45:45,245 --> 00:45:50,209
And if that is all,
we should thank the gods for it.

535
00:46:09,144 --> 00:46:11,104
My name's not really Jerril.

536
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:14,608
But you can keep calling me that.

537
00:46:15,817 --> 00:46:17,736
We've been watching you for some time.

538
00:46:17,819 --> 00:46:20,781
From the moment you solved
the Abraxas Conjecture, in fact.

539
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:22,991
I brought you a gift.

540
00:46:23,659 --> 00:46:27,204
He calls it the Prime Radiant.
It's beautiful, isn't it?

541
00:46:27,287 --> 00:46:31,291
He claims it contains all of his
predictions concerning the Empire,

542
00:46:31,375 --> 00:46:33,585
expressed as a mathematical equation.

543
00:46:33,669 --> 00:46:35,754
Did he allow you to examine it?

544
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:37,381
No.

545
00:46:38,215 --> 00:46:39,883
Now, don't you think that's curious?

546
00:46:39,967 --> 00:46:43,971
He devises a theory so opaque that
no one in the galaxy can understand it,

547
00:46:44,054 --> 00:46:46,223
and when he finds an individual who can,

548
00:46:46,306 --> 00:46:48,183
he doesn't allow her
a look behind the curtain.

549
00:46:48,267 --> 00:46:49,601
Why?

550
00:46:49,685 --> 00:46:53,772
Because history is littered
with charlatans and false messiahs.

551
00:46:54,356 --> 00:46:57,150
What if he's telling the truth?
What if psychohistory is real?

552
00:46:57,234 --> 00:46:58,944
If his equations are flawed,

553
00:46:59,027 --> 00:47:01,530
you have a moral obligation
to expose them.

554
00:47:10,455 --> 00:47:12,124
And if they hold true?

555
00:47:12,207 --> 00:47:14,543
Disavow them and go home.

556
00:47:14,626 --> 00:47:18,797
And I promise you, Empire will find
a way to express his gratitude.

557
00:47:20,174 --> 00:47:22,301
I'll make the calculus
simple for you, Gaal.

558
00:47:22,384 --> 00:47:24,887
If you say Hari's a liar, he dies.

559
00:47:24,970 --> 00:47:27,181
If you don't, you die.

560
00:47:27,264 --> 00:47:29,892
So, we should just all
bury our heads in the sand then?

561
00:47:29,975 --> 00:47:31,810
If his equations hold true,

562
00:47:31,894 --> 00:47:35,189
then Empire will set about
solving the problem as we always have,

563
00:47:35,272 --> 00:47:37,608
without terrifying trillions of people.

564
00:47:38,108 --> 00:47:40,152
And I should believe in you, a spy?

565
00:47:41,778 --> 00:47:44,198
You should believe
in the minds that built Trantor,

566
00:47:44,281 --> 00:47:46,450
built the jumpdrive,
that built the Star Bridge.

567
00:47:46,533 --> 00:47:49,953
Where I come from, they call those
scientists, not politicians.

568
00:47:50,037 --> 00:47:52,414
I know where you come from, Gaal.

569
00:47:54,249 --> 00:47:56,126
They were called heretics and drowned.

570
00:47:57,794 --> 00:48:00,506
And I also know
what happened on the jumpship.

571
00:48:01,673 --> 00:48:03,050
During the jump...

572
00:48:05,052 --> 00:48:06,053
you were awake.

573
00:48:06,887 --> 00:48:07,971
You were aware.

574
00:48:10,516 --> 00:48:12,893
- Why did you lie to me about it?
- I don't know.

575
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:16,104
It scares me.

576
00:48:17,439 --> 00:48:18,565
What does?

577
00:48:19,066 --> 00:48:20,943
Being different.

578
00:48:21,026 --> 00:48:22,569
We're all different, Ms. Dornick.

579
00:48:23,362 --> 00:48:26,198
My sister didn't speak
until she was seven.

580
00:48:26,281 --> 00:48:27,491
And even then, just nouns.

581
00:48:27,574 --> 00:48:29,535
But you're something else.

582
00:48:30,118 --> 00:48:32,704
And if you don't know what it is,
I urge you to figure it out

583
00:48:32,788 --> 00:48:35,541
before someone else does
and uses it against you.

584
00:49:28,594 --> 00:49:32,097
You claim your plan
can reduce the coming darkness.

585
00:49:33,098 --> 00:49:34,099
How?

586
00:49:34,183 --> 00:49:38,145
The ancients are rumored to have built
a repository for the world's wisdom.

587
00:49:38,228 --> 00:49:39,813
According to myth, it burned down.

588
00:49:39,897 --> 00:49:42,774
I'm proposing something less centralized.

589
00:49:43,358 --> 00:49:45,819
An Encyclopedia Galactica.

590
00:49:47,029 --> 00:49:51,325
After the fall, as civilization climbs
from the ashes,

591
00:49:52,284 --> 00:49:56,038
the coming generations
will have something to build upon,

592
00:49:56,538 --> 00:49:57,956
a foundation.

593
00:49:58,790 --> 00:50:04,087
They won't have to reinvent the wheel.
The knowledge will already exist.

594
00:50:04,171 --> 00:50:06,715
But it isn't just knowledge
we'd be saving,

595
00:50:07,341 --> 00:50:09,343
but humanity's story.

596
00:50:10,928 --> 00:50:13,222
Our story.

597
00:50:15,265 --> 00:50:18,101
Trantor already has an imperial library.

598
00:50:18,936 --> 00:50:19,937
For how long?

599
00:50:20,521 --> 00:50:23,524
Now, that statement does bring us
to the heart of the matter.

600
00:50:23,607 --> 00:50:28,487
You said you could prove your theorem
to someone conversant in ordinal analysis.

601
00:50:30,906 --> 00:50:32,950
Gaal Dornick, please rise.

602
00:50:34,826 --> 00:50:36,453
Approach the dais, if you would.

603
00:50:45,379 --> 00:50:49,132
You're from Synnax, correct?
We should say that.

604
00:50:49,216 --> 00:50:50,259
I am.

605
00:50:50,342 --> 00:50:52,302
You've had your prayer stones removed.

606
00:50:52,386 --> 00:50:54,471
You almost look like one of us.

607
00:50:54,555 --> 00:50:57,766
My understanding of your world
is that to remove the prayer stones

608
00:50:57,850 --> 00:50:59,643
is to break with the Seer Church.

609
00:50:59,726 --> 00:51:00,727
Is that right?

610
00:51:00,811 --> 00:51:03,480
That is church doctrine, yes.

611
00:51:03,564 --> 00:51:08,318
Tell me, are they still killing
scientists and mathematicians?

612
00:51:08,819 --> 00:51:11,363
If you're talking about the Purge, then...

613
00:51:12,197 --> 00:51:16,743
The church's term is "the Cleanse,"
Your Exalteds.

614
00:51:16,827 --> 00:51:18,662
When was it, according to church doctrine,

615
00:51:18,745 --> 00:51:21,707
that it stopped being heresy
to study math?

616
00:51:21,790 --> 00:51:22,958
It never stopped.

617
00:51:23,041 --> 00:51:26,461
And yet you solved the Abraxas Conjecture.

618
00:51:27,296 --> 00:51:28,297
Yes.

619
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:31,383
On a world where they burned
the universities down.

620
00:51:31,466 --> 00:51:33,427
You must have been lonely there.

621
00:51:34,094 --> 00:51:39,516
I can imagine how it must have felt
to be recognized by Dr. Hari Seldon.

622
00:51:40,893 --> 00:51:42,728
To be given a job. To be valued.

623
00:51:42,811 --> 00:51:44,188
What do you want to know?

624
00:51:44,271 --> 00:51:47,316
I want to know
if there is any possible way...

625
00:51:49,318 --> 00:51:52,696
you can be objective about Hari Seldon.

626
00:51:54,364 --> 00:51:56,241
I don't know. Maybe I can't.

627
00:51:57,534 --> 00:51:59,286
Maybe that's why he brought me here.

628
00:51:59,995 --> 00:52:01,580
Last night you were given a chance

629
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:04,875
to assess the accuracy
of Dr. Seldon's claims.

630
00:52:04,958 --> 00:52:06,627
Did you arrive at a conclusion?

631
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:11,131
Yes.

632
00:52:11,715 --> 00:52:12,715
And?

633
00:52:16,178 --> 00:52:18,764
Dr. Seldon's calculations...

634
00:52:19,598 --> 00:52:20,641
are correct.

635
00:52:21,225 --> 00:52:23,519
The Empire is dying.

636
00:52:24,937 --> 00:52:25,979
Kill them.

637
00:52:27,648 --> 00:52:28,815
End this.

638
00:52:42,871 --> 00:52:44,289
Hari, the sky.

639
00:52:45,499 --> 00:52:47,584
Something's wrong with the Star Bridge.

640
00:53:14,194 --> 00:53:16,613
Please respect and enjoy the peace.

641
00:53:18,323 --> 00:53:20,284
Expected return to home planet?

642
00:53:20,367 --> 00:53:21,577
Three days.

643
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:24,121
- Please respect and enjoy the peace.
- Thank you.

644
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:34,089
This car will commence
its descent down the stalk momentarily.

645
00:53:34,631 --> 00:53:36,133
You may feel a jolt.

646
00:53:36,842 --> 00:53:40,095
Please secure yourself
before commencing descent.

647
00:56:58,710 --> 00:57:02,005
The tether wrapped around
the planet like a garrote.

648
00:57:02,089 --> 00:57:03,715
It cut 50 levels down.

649
00:57:03,799 --> 00:57:05,259
- Emperor...
- Shut up!

650
00:57:16,436 --> 00:57:22,067
There are reports of Anacreon and Thespin
war cries before the explosion.

651
00:57:22,568 --> 00:57:23,610
Songs of rebellion.

652
00:57:23,694 --> 00:57:25,946
We had no part in this, we...

653
00:57:26,029 --> 00:57:29,366
We will, of course,
be returning your gifts.

654
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:36,164
86,963,777.

655
00:57:39,126 --> 00:57:44,423
86,963,791.

656
00:57:50,637 --> 00:57:51,847
What are you doing here?

657
00:57:51,930 --> 00:57:53,557
I petitioned the committee.

658
00:57:56,226 --> 00:57:58,604
They're saying a hundred million dead.

659
00:57:59,479 --> 00:58:01,607
The Outer Reaches may be in rebellion.

660
00:58:02,357 --> 00:58:04,359
The attack's changed everything.

661
00:58:07,029 --> 00:58:09,740
Hari said there's
a nonzero chance you'll die,

662
00:58:09,823 --> 00:58:11,700
but nonzero is still a number.

663
00:58:12,492 --> 00:58:15,245
They're gonna kill Hari, Gaal.

664
00:58:17,331 --> 00:58:20,542
- You don't have to die with him.
- I've already said his math was right.

665
00:58:22,085 --> 00:58:25,506
Say you looked at it again.
Say you were wrong.

666
00:58:26,006 --> 00:58:27,508
You've lost faith.

667
00:58:29,176 --> 00:58:30,594
I'm sorry.

668
00:58:30,677 --> 00:58:32,095
She doesn't need that.

669
00:58:39,686 --> 00:58:40,938
Get up.

670
00:58:45,234 --> 00:58:48,153
Shall I speak first, or will you?

671
00:58:48,237 --> 00:58:50,239
By all means, Dr. Seldon.

672
00:58:51,406 --> 00:58:52,407
Speak.

673
00:58:52,491 --> 00:58:53,951
You hold us responsible.

674
00:58:54,034 --> 00:58:55,369
How could I not?

675
00:58:55,452 --> 00:58:59,581
My science can predict societal actions.
Trends. Not individual ones.

676
00:59:00,082 --> 00:59:02,793
But I'm not surprised it happened.

677
00:59:02,876 --> 00:59:04,086
Why is that?

678
00:59:04,169 --> 00:59:05,754
You're stretched too thin.

679
00:59:07,339 --> 00:59:10,300
That's why the kingdoms
of the Outer Reach struck first.

680
00:59:10,384 --> 00:59:12,261
And who can blame them?

681
00:59:12,970 --> 00:59:17,516
Sensing vulnerability, soon other players
will begin to apply downward pressure.

682
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:22,688
An exhortation from one of
the galaxy's major religions is a given.

683
00:59:22,771 --> 00:59:25,148
Or perhaps a homegrown
insurrection here on Trantor.

684
00:59:25,232 --> 00:59:27,568
Star Bridge. Who did this?

685
00:59:28,235 --> 00:59:29,945
I don't know.

686
00:59:30,028 --> 00:59:33,699
Tell me why I shouldn't kill you
and your followers right now.

687
00:59:33,782 --> 00:59:35,242
My followers aren't responsible!

688
00:59:35,325 --> 00:59:37,286
If you do, you'll be dead within the year.

689
00:59:40,372 --> 00:59:42,207
The prodigy speaks.

690
00:59:51,175 --> 00:59:52,426
So speak.

691
00:59:54,761 --> 00:59:58,974
Your agent Jerril asked me
to check Dr. Seldon's work.

692
00:59:59,057 --> 01:00:01,185
I went a little farther in the equation.

693
01:00:01,268 --> 01:00:05,731
If you kill him, the fall accelerates.

694
01:00:05,814 --> 01:00:08,901
Well, that's a convenient data point
for your side.

695
01:00:09,401 --> 01:00:12,070
Only he can shorten the darkness.

696
01:00:13,322 --> 01:00:15,032
Kill him, you kill hope.

697
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:17,534
Kill hope...

698
01:00:18,535 --> 01:00:19,995
they kill you.

699
01:00:23,749 --> 01:00:25,209
What are the odds?

700
01:00:27,669 --> 01:00:31,840
The only two people who can save
the galaxy are in this room.

701
01:00:34,134 --> 01:00:36,011
And one of them is wrong.

702
01:00:36,512 --> 01:00:37,763
I agree.

703
01:00:39,890 --> 01:00:44,353
If the fall can be accelerated,
can it not also be slowed?

704
01:00:44,853 --> 01:00:48,148
Yes. By a few centuries.

705
01:00:48,232 --> 01:00:50,067
Don't keep us in the dark.

706
01:00:50,692 --> 01:00:52,319
End imperial cloning.

707
01:00:54,446 --> 01:00:58,116
Imperial cloning stopped the wars.

708
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:00,577
Imperial cloning brought peace.

709
01:01:00,661 --> 01:01:04,122
Our genetic dynasty has reigned
for almost four centuries.

710
01:01:04,206 --> 01:01:09,211
Surely you can understand the value in
a younger mind who shares your intellect.

711
01:01:09,962 --> 01:01:13,048
Well, I see the value in difference,

712
01:01:13,131 --> 01:01:14,383
in the new.

713
01:01:14,883 --> 01:01:16,468
You offer nothing new.

714
01:01:16,552 --> 01:01:18,971
Just a younger grape...

715
01:01:20,848 --> 01:01:22,391
from the same vine,

716
01:01:22,474 --> 01:01:25,352
destined for the same old bottle.

717
01:01:29,064 --> 01:01:31,441
You can't save yourselves...

718
01:01:33,068 --> 01:01:35,112
but you can save your legacy.

719
01:01:35,195 --> 01:01:37,948
Yours or mine, Dr. Seldon?

720
01:01:53,630 --> 01:01:55,215
How long did it take you...

721
01:01:58,385 --> 01:02:00,304
to trigger the Prime Radiant?

722
01:02:00,971 --> 01:02:02,723
I got it on the second try.

723
01:02:06,101 --> 01:02:07,936
You knew they'd offer it to me.

724
01:02:14,318 --> 01:02:15,986
Hari, when I looked at it, I...

725
01:02:17,738 --> 01:02:20,699
I really thought they'd try
and make it seem more of a fair fight.

726
01:02:20,782 --> 01:02:22,659
But they didn't bother, did they?

727
01:02:22,743 --> 01:02:23,744
Did we?

728
01:02:26,413 --> 01:02:28,123
The hook still hurting you?

729
01:02:29,625 --> 01:02:34,505
Xylas used the same phrase you did.
"I was lonely."

730
01:02:35,005 --> 01:02:36,965
They were listening.

731
01:02:37,049 --> 01:02:38,592
And you knew they were listening.

732
01:02:38,675 --> 01:02:41,261
- They're listening now.
- Fine.

733
01:02:41,345 --> 01:02:43,055
What do you want them to hear?

734
01:02:43,639 --> 01:02:47,935
Abraxas was the bait. Not you.

735
01:02:48,644 --> 01:02:50,562
I just moved before they did.

736
01:02:51,271 --> 01:02:54,316
You have more agency here, Gaal,
than you realize.

737
01:03:14,878 --> 01:03:19,049
The Emperor has determined that
your deaths are not the optimal outcome

738
01:03:19,132 --> 01:03:20,717
for the good of the Imperium.

739
01:03:20,801 --> 01:03:24,054
You will be allowed to refine your work
on psychohistory,

740
01:03:24,137 --> 01:03:25,889
to build your Foundation.

741
01:03:28,642 --> 01:03:30,060
But not on Trantor.

742
01:03:31,311 --> 01:03:32,437
Terminus.

743
01:03:32,521 --> 01:03:36,775
It is uninhabited,
sitting in the Periphery,

744
01:03:36,859 --> 01:03:38,777
along the galaxy's Outer Reach.

745
01:03:38,861 --> 01:03:41,405
Anacreon and Thespis are also
in the Periphery.

746
01:03:41,488 --> 01:03:44,783
Yes, the barbarian kingdoms
will be your neighbors.

747
01:03:45,742 --> 01:03:47,411
You will journey via slow ship.

748
01:03:47,494 --> 01:03:50,539
The Empire forbids you access
to jumpdrive technology.

749
01:03:50,622 --> 01:03:52,207
You're exiling us.

750
01:03:52,291 --> 01:03:56,170
On Terminus, you will not trouble Trantor,

751
01:03:56,253 --> 01:03:59,131
and there will be no disturbance
of the Emperor's peace.

752
01:04:00,132 --> 01:04:02,926
The galaxy will know
that you are fighting the fall.

753
01:04:03,594 --> 01:04:06,096
If psychohistory proves fraudulent,

754
01:04:07,222 --> 01:04:11,643
your Foundation will be allowed
to wither and vanish.

755
01:04:12,186 --> 01:04:13,770
And if it's successful,

756
01:04:14,938 --> 01:04:19,359
you'll co-opt it
and use it to bolster your regime.

757
01:04:22,946 --> 01:04:25,115
Terminus. I've never even heard of it.

758
01:04:25,199 --> 01:04:28,869
There's no reason you would.
It's 50,000 light-years away.

759
01:04:28,952 --> 01:04:31,121
Without a jumpdrive, the journey there...

760
01:04:31,205 --> 01:04:34,917
- 878 days.
- Approximately.

761
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,668
We'll be fine.

762
01:04:36,752 --> 01:04:38,962
There'll be hardships, no question.

763
01:04:39,463 --> 01:04:42,633
Terminus orbits a red dwarf.

764
01:04:42,716 --> 01:04:45,594
Its seasons are extreme.
Metal and mineral poor.

765
01:04:45,677 --> 01:04:46,929
You know it well.

766
01:04:49,765 --> 01:04:51,350
Exile was always the plan.

767
01:04:52,226 --> 01:04:54,895
And Terminus was always
the optimal location.

768
01:04:54,978 --> 01:04:56,563
Out in the Periphery.

769
01:04:56,647 --> 01:04:59,316
Imperial support without imperial eyes.
It's perfect.

770
01:04:59,399 --> 01:05:00,484
How many others knew?

771
01:05:00,567 --> 01:05:01,693
Only Raych.

772
01:05:04,947 --> 01:05:06,907
What you said to the Emperor...

773
01:05:06,990 --> 01:05:09,785
How much farther into my math
did you look?

774
01:05:10,369 --> 01:05:11,703
What did you actually see?

775
01:05:12,329 --> 01:05:14,289
- I couldn't quite figure it.
- So, you lied?

776
01:05:14,373 --> 01:05:15,791
I hypothesized.

777
01:05:16,959 --> 01:05:20,337
On Synnax, no one wanted to hear
that our seas were rising.

778
01:05:21,213 --> 01:05:24,049
I thought if I could make people listen,
that I could save them.

779
01:05:24,633 --> 01:05:28,679
Change is frightening,
especially to those in power.

780
01:05:28,762 --> 01:05:30,848
And I could feel the Empire's fear.

781
01:05:32,683 --> 01:05:36,520
When I looked into the Prime Radiant,
I could see the darkness.

782
01:05:36,603 --> 01:05:40,232
It took my breath away at first.
It was crushing.

783
01:05:41,275 --> 01:05:43,193
But then I looked deeper,

784
01:05:43,277 --> 01:05:48,490
and I could see this tiny sliver of light
at the very end of it all.

785
01:05:50,367 --> 01:05:53,370
And I realized
it's not the fall they're afraid of.

786
01:05:53,871 --> 01:05:56,456
It's the chance that
your plan will actually succeed.

787
01:05:58,542 --> 01:06:01,044
It takes more power to build than to burn.

788
01:06:02,004 --> 01:06:03,797
And I want to build, Hari.

789
01:06:04,923 --> 01:06:06,675
You'll get your chance.

790
01:06:08,093 --> 01:06:11,722
This isn't the Foundation's first crisis,
and it won't be our last.

791
01:06:11,805 --> 01:06:15,309
Something tells me you already know
what the next crisis will be.

792
01:06:16,393 --> 01:06:19,813
The Emperor's peace will be maintained.

793
01:06:25,110 --> 01:06:29,239
From Synnax to Trantor. Now Terminus.

794
01:06:29,740 --> 01:06:32,159
You came here hoping to save your world.

795
01:06:32,242 --> 01:06:34,661
I'm asking you to dream bigger.

796
01:06:35,746 --> 01:06:39,499
Why stop at one world?
Why not save the galaxy?

797
01:06:40,792 --> 01:06:42,085
Why not indeed.

798
01:07:11,406 --> 01:07:13,534
Hari had planned for it all,

799
01:07:13,617 --> 01:07:16,119
things only he saw over the horizon.

800
01:07:19,623 --> 01:07:23,335
Psychohistory could forecast the behavior
of entire populations

801
01:07:23,418 --> 01:07:25,254
with stunning accuracy.

802
01:07:25,337 --> 01:07:30,008
But, when it came to individuals,
things got murkier.

803
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:39,977
No one could approach the Vault.
No one but an outlier like Salvor Hardin.

804
01:07:41,270 --> 01:07:42,813
And I always wondered...

805
01:07:44,606 --> 01:07:46,650
when Hari was formulating his plan,

806
01:07:47,359 --> 01:07:51,947
did he realize the galaxy's fate
would rest on what she found inside?

807
01:07:53,156 --> 01:07:54,741
I think he did.

808
01:07:55,993 --> 01:07:58,370
And I think
that's what he feared the most.

808
01:07:59,305 --> 01:08:59,728
