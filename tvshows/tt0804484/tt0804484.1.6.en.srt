2
00:01:26,378 --> 00:01:29,548
As a child,
I heard stories about Trantor,

3
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:34,303
the city that was a planet
at the heart of the galaxy.

4
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:40,642
I was told the people who lived there
were sinners who followed a false prophet...

5
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:46,315
a man who believed himself
above the Sleeper's words.

6
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:49,693
I didn't believe the stories

7
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:51,695
until I met him.

8
00:02:01,997 --> 00:02:04,833
You have just completed the jump, Empire.

9
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:09,128
We'll be reaching the Surah System
within a few hours.

10
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:29,525
I was told that the Emperor
could create or destroy worlds,

11
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:34,613
that he had triumphed over death itself
and would live forever.

12
00:02:35,781 --> 00:02:37,533
And when I looked into his eyes...

13
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:43,747
I saw a man who, in all his lifetimes,
had never known doubt...

14
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:49,753
until he encountered Hari Seldon.

15
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,486
I'm ready to review for...

16
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:20,158
A moment, Empire.
I wasn't expecting you so soon.

17
00:03:24,997 --> 00:03:27,666
Even as a child,
you'd watch my preparations.

18
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:40,637
Are you feeling quite well, Empire?

19
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:42,723
It's just the jump.

20
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:48,478
I know the Spacers are engineered for it,
but I barely consider them human.

21
00:03:50,272 --> 00:03:53,066
It can be disconcerting, I know.

22
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:55,319
What's it like...

23
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:58,197
to be awake for it?

24
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,781
When space folds?

25
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:05,162
The human mind can't tolerate
the discontinuity.

26
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,246
But...

27
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,499
yours can.

28
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:13,212
If I could explain it,
you wouldn't have to sleep through it.

29
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:22,221
Leviathan crystal.

30
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:26,058
Salt from the leviathan mines
on the Maiden.

31
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:27,851
And its significance?

32
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:30,562
It symbolizes the journey
of the three goddesses,

33
00:04:30,646 --> 00:04:32,648
Maiden, Mother and Crone.

34
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:36,527
Adherents pray
by ritualistically touching it.

35
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,948
Goes to the central theme of Luminism,

36
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:44,868
cycles, ouroboros,
nature seeking completion.

37
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:47,079
Origination?

38
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:50,541
Luminists believe the goddesses
were once a single entity,

39
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:53,877
but when Surah collided
with the planet of...

40
00:04:56,964 --> 00:04:58,298
Begins with a D.

41
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,592
Dol.

42
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:04,596
It split the goddesses apart,
creating the three moons.

43
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,140
The only habitable moon is the Maiden.

44
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,643
Age of faith?

45
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:11,854
15,000 years.

46
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:15,983
Predates the Empire itself.

47
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:18,944
Number of believers?

48
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:20,904
Three trillion.

49
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:31,081
I've never asked you,

50
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:34,877
how is it that you believe?

51
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:39,047
How? Or why?

52
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:40,215
The latter.

53
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:47,014
From the moment you come into the world,
you and your brothers know your purpose.

54
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:49,641
But the rest of us have to seek
these things on our own.

55
00:05:49,725 --> 00:05:52,811
But... you know your purpose.

56
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:57,274
It's to serve my brothers, to serve me,
to serve the Empire above all.

57
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,109
It's literally written into your code.

58
00:05:59,193 --> 00:06:01,904
And I am quite fulfilled in that service.

59
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:06,325
But the search for meaning
is not always about the answer.

60
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:08,994
It's also the process of seeking
that enlightens.

61
00:06:10,329 --> 00:06:13,290
The goddesses didn't choose
to be split into three.

62
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:15,751
They long to be made one again.

63
00:06:16,627 --> 00:06:19,880
The salty terrain of the Maiden
is said to be their tears.

64
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:23,842
But it was their sacrifice that graced
the rest of us with wholeness.

65
00:06:23,926 --> 00:06:28,096
At every point in our lives,
we have the power to choose our own path.

66
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:33,143
The goddesses guide us at every step
toward service and truth,

67
00:06:33,936 --> 00:06:36,438
as though toward the center
of a great spiral.

68
00:06:40,484 --> 00:06:44,780
And this Zephyr Halima who challenges us,
what has her path been?

69
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:48,951
She hails from Mirrus Twelve,
born into the faith.

70
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:52,162
After the earthquakes there,
she became a sort of a savior,

71
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:54,039
spearheading the recovery effort.

72
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:56,708
But she's been elevated to Zephyr
for less than a year.

73
00:06:57,751 --> 00:07:00,587
She's only just pulled herself
out from the rubble.

74
00:07:01,547 --> 00:07:04,025
Forgive me, Empire, but we have
entered the Maiden's atmosphere

75
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:06,343
and will be approaching
the Salt Palace in moments.

76
00:07:31,577 --> 00:07:33,620
Ready to meet the clamoring masses?

77
00:07:34,663 --> 00:07:37,082
I was planning on staying aboard the ship.

78
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:38,333
Why?

79
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:41,378
Clearly, many on the Maiden know
I embrace their faith.

80
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:44,089
This could be used to your disadvantage.

81
00:07:44,173 --> 00:07:45,674
Don't be ridiculous.

82
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:51,471
You're my only real insight
into the Luminist beliefs.

83
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:56,810
You're going.

84
00:08:25,047 --> 00:08:26,590
Zephyr Halima.

85
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:29,968
Welcome to the Maiden, Empire.

86
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:35,640
I know preparing for a formal ceremony
can be daunting,

87
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,101
which is why I petitioned
the Ring of Zephyrs

88
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,854
and was granted the honor
of welcoming you alone.

89
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:42,648
Alone?

90
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:47,027
Empire is undoubtedly accustomed
to a certain degree of pageantry,

91
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:51,114
but given the somber circumstances
of the Proxima's passing,

92
00:08:51,907 --> 00:08:54,368
a more florid reception felt somehow...

93
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:56,787
indecorous.

94
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:57,913
Of course.

95
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:03,043
I want to thank you, from my heart,
for making the journey to us.

96
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:07,673
Your presence speaks to how important
Luminism must be to the Empire.

97
00:09:08,257 --> 00:09:12,594
As a gesture of my gratitude,
I'd like to offer you a drink.

98
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:25,148
The water is from the Womb
of the Mother itself.

99
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:28,861
The salt from this cup is said to draw out
any impure intentions

100
00:09:28,944 --> 00:09:30,863
from the minds of those who drink from it.

101
00:09:30,946 --> 00:09:34,616
Sadly, Empire is not able to accept
any untested potables.

102
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:39,913
I'm afraid whatever impurities
I may harbor will have to remain hidden.

103
00:09:39,997 --> 00:09:42,833
Something tells me
that's how you'd prefer it.

104
00:09:45,169 --> 00:09:48,672
In any case, I look forward
to getting to know each other better.

105
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:51,717
Triple blessings to you all.

106
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:04,021
What is the word I'm looking for?

107
00:10:04,605 --> 00:10:05,606
Worthy?

108
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:07,524
That will do.

109
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:11,570
I don't think
she was trying to poison you.

110
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:13,488
No, not literally.

111
00:10:13,572 --> 00:10:15,782
But I don't think anyone
with pure intentions

112
00:10:15,866 --> 00:10:18,744
would wheedle their way
on to my welcoming committee.

113
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:38,931
Stay sharp.

114
00:10:39,515 --> 00:10:41,225
Our target may be armed.

115
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,144
Or he might be dead.

116
00:10:45,229 --> 00:10:46,230
He's alive.

117
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:49,566
Empire ships are as good
at preserving their people's lives...

118
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:51,652
as they are at taking others'.

119
00:11:02,204 --> 00:11:04,998
Commander, you're alive
because you're useful to us.

120
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:07,751
And you're already dead.

121
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:11,797
You just don't know it yet.

122
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,090
Course we know it.

123
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:17,427
We're an army of ghosts.

124
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:44,162
Hey. This way.

125
00:12:08,312 --> 00:12:09,354
You okay?

126
00:12:11,982 --> 00:12:13,358
Gia.

127
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:17,905
What happened here?

128
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:22,409
Oh, geez.

129
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:24,870
It's okay. You're fine.

130
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:28,707
Make for a nice story one day,
if we survive this.

131
00:12:33,045 --> 00:12:35,547
Now, let's get out of here
before we get shot.

132
00:12:53,774 --> 00:12:55,317
We have the manifest.

133
00:12:56,026 --> 00:12:57,694
Sort the names.

134
00:12:57,778 --> 00:13:02,783
I need environmental, propulsion,
and astronautics engineers.

135
00:13:03,367 --> 00:13:05,118
And contact Team Alder.

136
00:13:05,953 --> 00:13:07,871
I want the corvettes ready for launch.

137
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:10,290
They're still at the caldera.

138
00:13:10,374 --> 00:13:12,751
Tell them to work faster.

139
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:15,420
The Invictus won't wait forever.

140
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,131
Why is she still alive?

141
00:13:20,884 --> 00:13:22,928
That vault.

142
00:13:23,345 --> 00:13:24,847
It's the worst kind of unknown.

143
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:27,724
And she seems to be the key to it.

144
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:31,228
Once we've neutralized it,

145
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:32,938
we'll kill her.

146
00:13:33,856 --> 00:13:35,858
Are you sure this will work, Huntress?

147
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:38,527
The Invictus is our redemption,

148
00:13:39,236 --> 00:13:42,364
and we have earned it with our pain.

149
00:13:58,338 --> 00:13:59,381
You ready?

150
00:14:10,726 --> 00:14:12,519
Are these the names of your original crew?

151
00:14:13,103 --> 00:14:15,731
Every person who served
on the Deliverance.

152
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:20,903
You can see we lost some people to age
or accidents when we settled Terminus.

153
00:14:21,403 --> 00:14:23,280
Show me the environmental engineer.

154
00:14:37,461 --> 00:14:38,921
Astronautics?

155
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:41,798
Who was his second?

156
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:45,761
I was. I took over that specialty.

157
00:14:47,346 --> 00:14:48,680
Propulsion?

158
00:14:50,641 --> 00:14:53,685
Studied at Crito Orbital Academy.

159
00:14:54,770 --> 00:15:00,943
Logged over 5,000 hours on
imperial transport and merchant vessels,

160
00:15:01,026 --> 00:15:02,528
sub-light and FTL.

161
00:15:05,614 --> 00:15:07,574
You're trying to crew a jumpship.

162
00:15:07,658 --> 00:15:09,868
So why did you shoot down
Commander Dorwin's?

163
00:15:10,452 --> 00:15:14,373
Because I needed the man himself,
not his little crater jumper.

164
00:15:14,456 --> 00:15:16,834
What you've done is an act of war.

165
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:18,669
We have who we need.

166
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:21,630
Restore power to the fence and recode it.

167
00:15:21,713 --> 00:15:24,216
I don't want these people sneaking away
before we're done.

168
00:15:30,681 --> 00:15:32,766
- Hi.
- Hiya.

169
00:15:45,529 --> 00:15:47,447
I will explain this only once.

170
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,076
The Foundation has
a breadth of knowledge we lack.

171
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:54,288
And so we require a handful of your people

172
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,749
to assist us in repairing a starship.

173
00:15:57,833 --> 00:16:00,002
If the repairs go as planned,

174
00:16:00,085 --> 00:16:04,047
we leave Terminus, and you return
to life as you've known it.

175
00:16:04,131 --> 00:16:06,884
If you refuse us, then we all die,

176
00:16:07,676 --> 00:16:09,553
Anacreons, Terminus alike.

177
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:12,097
Jacenta Rov, step forward.

178
00:16:16,935 --> 00:16:19,688
You were the chief environmental engineer
on the Deliverance?

179
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:22,024
I was. But I won't work for you.

180
00:16:22,524 --> 00:16:24,610
My loyalty lies with the Foundation.

181
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,621
I shot one leg.

182
00:16:35,704 --> 00:16:37,331
Your husband has another.

183
00:16:37,998 --> 00:16:39,708
Do we understand each other?

184
00:16:46,048 --> 00:16:47,216
Akiva Lee.

185
00:16:50,802 --> 00:16:54,056
Can you maintain a quantum folding engine
on an Altair-class warship?

186
00:16:55,474 --> 00:16:56,475
Yes.

187
00:17:03,106 --> 00:17:04,483
Lewis Pirenne.

188
00:17:04,566 --> 00:17:07,152
Please, it's been 30 years since I've...

189
00:17:14,535 --> 00:17:17,162
You're certain this is everyone we need?

190
00:17:23,836 --> 00:17:25,963
I thought you were trying to poison me.

191
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:30,008
They helped, the wolvesbreath leaves.

192
00:17:30,926 --> 00:17:32,594
I'm less sore today.

193
00:17:32,678 --> 00:17:33,971
I'm glad, Empire.

194
00:17:34,805 --> 00:17:37,099
It would be my honor
to be of any further assistance.

195
00:17:37,182 --> 00:17:39,643
You can be of further assistance

196
00:17:40,227 --> 00:17:45,023
in accepting my regret that I spoke to you
as I did the other day.

197
00:17:51,446 --> 00:17:52,990
Perfect symmetry here.

198
00:17:53,657 --> 00:17:55,409
Hedges trimmed every day.

199
00:17:56,201 --> 00:17:58,954
Foolish attempt to control
the uncontrollable.

200
00:18:05,836 --> 00:18:08,505
A plant will grow
in the direction of light...

201
00:18:10,174 --> 00:18:11,175
won't it?

202
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:13,385
It will, Empire.

203
00:18:24,271 --> 00:18:26,523
I know I told you to get rid of those...

204
00:18:29,026 --> 00:18:30,027
but leave them.

205
00:18:31,236 --> 00:18:32,988
May the light never dim.

206
00:18:34,406 --> 00:18:35,616
I suspect it won't.

207
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:46,126
When I summon you,
I expect you to arrive promptly.

208
00:18:47,377 --> 00:18:50,297
As you can see, I have a surprise for you.

209
00:18:50,881 --> 00:18:53,550
A challenge on your first time out.

210
00:18:53,634 --> 00:18:56,887
Ghillie raptors. Now, they blend
into their surroundings so well

211
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:59,681
you can hardly find them,
let alone shoot them.

212
00:19:00,307 --> 00:19:03,685
Look for the movement, not the color.

213
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:08,524
Under normal circumstances, Brother Day
would introduce you to the hunt.

214
00:19:08,607 --> 00:19:11,985
But since he's decided to buck tradition
and leave Trantor,

215
00:19:12,069 --> 00:19:14,321
that responsibility falls to me.

216
00:19:14,404 --> 00:19:16,365
- Have you heard from him?
- No.

217
00:19:16,949 --> 00:19:18,283
Neither will you.

218
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:22,246
Consider it the rare opportunity

219
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:25,958
for you to exercise your independence.

220
00:19:34,716 --> 00:19:36,218
First one of the day.

221
00:19:36,301 --> 00:19:39,304
I doubt you even saw that creature
before I shot...

222
00:19:46,436 --> 00:19:47,771
Lucky shot.

223
00:19:47,855 --> 00:19:48,856
It was.

224
00:19:49,523 --> 00:19:52,526
Give me the day,
and I'll mold that luck into skill.

225
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:54,987
I'd rather mold it myself.

226
00:19:56,113 --> 00:19:58,824
Well then, good hunting to you.

227
00:19:59,992 --> 00:20:01,034
And to you.

228
00:20:05,998 --> 00:20:08,792
Four moons, she's heavy.

229
00:20:08,876 --> 00:20:10,335
- Poly?
- Oh, shit.

230
00:20:11,587 --> 00:20:12,921
Damn it, Poly. That hurt.

231
00:20:13,005 --> 00:20:14,256
Sorry.

232
00:20:15,632 --> 00:20:16,633
Where are we?

233
00:20:16,717 --> 00:20:18,135
Geothermal tunnels.

234
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:20,345
We saw you in the brig
and dragged you out here.

235
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:23,015
You're way heavier than you look.

236
00:20:26,351 --> 00:20:27,352
Thanks.

237
00:20:30,147 --> 00:20:31,148
Warden?

238
00:20:31,648 --> 00:20:32,900
What's an Invictus?

239
00:20:33,483 --> 00:20:34,735
Where'd you hear that name?

240
00:20:35,569 --> 00:20:39,573
Phara said it when she was with you.
It was the only word I could make out.

241
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:43,327
It was a legendary destroyer.
But it disappeared centuries ago.

242
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:44,786
It's like a ghost ship.

243
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:47,706
Well, I think Phara's found it.

244
00:20:55,714 --> 00:20:58,217
- On the ground. On the ground!
- Get down. Get down.

245
00:20:58,842 --> 00:21:01,261
- Salvor.
- Dad. Dad.

246
00:21:01,345 --> 00:21:02,638
Hugo!

247
00:21:04,348 --> 00:21:06,683
- You too!
- Mayor Hardin.

248
00:21:07,976 --> 00:21:09,228
Thank Seldon.

249
00:21:09,311 --> 00:21:10,854
What are you doing here?

250
00:21:10,938 --> 00:21:13,232
The Anacreons recoded the fence,
locked us out.

251
00:21:13,315 --> 00:21:15,817
We figured the hulk was
as safe a place as any to hide.

252
00:21:15,901 --> 00:21:18,087
Told him it was one of the stops
on your nightly rounds.

253
00:21:18,111 --> 00:21:20,072
You can save all that pillow talk
for later.

254
00:21:20,155 --> 00:21:21,990
Right now, we need a plan
to get back inside.

255
00:21:22,074 --> 00:21:23,784
We're not going back.

256
00:21:23,867 --> 00:21:25,702
What do you mean, we're not going back?

257
00:21:28,163 --> 00:21:30,707
The Anacreon corvettes are
on the geothermal field.

258
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:34,378
Forget the corvettes.
We need to protect the Foundation.

259
00:21:34,461 --> 00:21:36,964
This is about protecting the Foundation.

260
00:21:37,047 --> 00:21:40,884
Phara's after a warship. I think.
A planet-killer.

261
00:21:40,968 --> 00:21:43,929
If she gets her hands on it, she'll pull
the whole galaxy into conflict.

262
00:21:44,012 --> 00:21:46,306
This is the first Seldon Crisis.

263
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:50,352
The Vault waking up now,
the instincts driving me...

264
00:21:52,062 --> 00:21:56,108
Hari put me here to stop the Anacreons,
and he's helping me figure out how.

265
00:21:57,025 --> 00:22:00,028
So I'm following those instincts,

266
00:22:00,112 --> 00:22:02,781
and we're taking out those corvettes.
Understood?

267
00:22:04,533 --> 00:22:05,951
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

268
00:22:06,034 --> 00:22:07,953
Not you two. You're staying here.

269
00:22:08,036 --> 00:22:09,288
But we saved you.

270
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:12,040
And I'm grateful.

271
00:22:12,124 --> 00:22:13,750
But this is wild work,

272
00:22:13,834 --> 00:22:15,752
and I'm not having your blood on my hands.

273
00:22:28,891 --> 00:22:30,434
Esteemed Empire.

274
00:22:30,517 --> 00:22:33,937
I expected the clamoring masses
upon my arrival,

275
00:22:34,021 --> 00:22:36,732
but instead I'm greeted by a heretic.

276
00:22:36,815 --> 00:22:39,026
Profuse apologies, Empire.

277
00:22:39,109 --> 00:22:41,862
I assure you, a proper welcome awaits.

278
00:22:43,739 --> 00:22:46,033
May I present Zephyr Gilat.

279
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:48,911
Triple blessings to you, Empire.

280
00:22:49,912 --> 00:22:51,830
The pleasure is mine, Zephyr.

281
00:22:52,331 --> 00:22:56,335
My condolences on the passing
of Proxima Opal.

282
00:22:56,418 --> 00:23:00,506
Thank you, Empire. It is a sad occasion,
but also a hopeful one.

283
00:23:00,589 --> 00:23:02,132
Especially for you.

284
00:23:02,216 --> 00:23:05,719
I shall gracefully accept whatever
the Ring of Zephyrs should decide.

285
00:23:05,802 --> 00:23:07,971
Tell us, what is your sense
of how they currently lean?

286
00:23:08,055 --> 00:23:11,391
Zephyr Gilat is still most likely
to be named Proxima.

287
00:23:11,475 --> 00:23:16,271
However, it will not take much
to tip things in a less desirable fashion.

288
00:23:16,355 --> 00:23:17,356
I understand.

289
00:23:19,107 --> 00:23:21,818
We want to help you
in whatever way we can.

290
00:23:21,902 --> 00:23:23,737
That is most generous.

291
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:28,075
We cannot deny that Halima has
a natural charisma.

292
00:23:28,867 --> 00:23:32,412
I feel it is necessary for me
to offer something concrete.

293
00:23:32,496 --> 00:23:37,417
With all due respect, Empire,
the infrastructure's crumbling.

294
00:23:37,501 --> 00:23:40,796
Fresh water has long been expensive
and hard to come by.

295
00:23:40,879 --> 00:23:44,675
Something in this Halima
is quenching their thirst.

296
00:23:44,758 --> 00:23:47,010
I think we have a solution for that.

297
00:23:47,094 --> 00:23:51,181
We'll take Halima's metaphor
and make it literal.

298
00:23:55,811 --> 00:24:00,858
Zephyr Gilat, in honor of your rising
as the next Proxima,

299
00:24:00,941 --> 00:24:04,444
Empire will build a moon-wide
desalination system.

300
00:24:05,028 --> 00:24:09,074
Your people will never go
without clean drinking water again.

301
00:24:13,662 --> 00:24:16,582
I am without words, Empire.

302
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:21,170
Triple blessings to you, Zephyr Gilat.

303
00:24:39,229 --> 00:24:40,230
You okay?

304
00:24:40,939 --> 00:24:43,275
I was not cut out for this wind.

305
00:24:43,859 --> 00:24:46,695
I spent those first years
with my fists clenched.

306
00:24:47,196 --> 00:24:48,363
One day your mother said,

307
00:24:48,447 --> 00:24:50,824
"Open your fists, man.
You can't punch the wind."

308
00:24:50,908 --> 00:24:53,160
You go on, Hugo. We'll catch up.

309
00:24:56,788 --> 00:25:01,001
Growing up on Trantor, childhood indoors...

310
00:25:02,628 --> 00:25:03,879
makes you soft.

311
00:25:05,255 --> 00:25:07,633
You never talk much about Trantor.

312
00:25:08,842 --> 00:25:10,010
What's the point?

313
00:25:10,886 --> 00:25:12,262
We're never going back there.

314
00:25:12,763 --> 00:25:14,014
Was it bad?

315
00:25:14,765 --> 00:25:17,601
On the contrary. It was incredible.

316
00:25:17,684 --> 00:25:21,522
Your grandparents worked the Star Bridge,
so we were pretty well-off.

317
00:25:22,147 --> 00:25:23,565
Miracles everywhere.

318
00:25:24,566 --> 00:25:26,693
Floating fountains,

319
00:25:26,777 --> 00:25:29,696
synchronized water shows with whales

320
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:32,658
and things swimming
above your head in zero G.

321
00:25:33,367 --> 00:25:35,202
And the food... Oh, my God.

322
00:25:35,285 --> 00:25:37,496
The finest everything.

323
00:25:38,121 --> 00:25:39,623
You think I'm fat now?

324
00:25:42,042 --> 00:25:43,585
But here's the thing, Sal.

325
00:25:45,587 --> 00:25:51,593
We knew it was built
on a mountain of lies and deception,

326
00:25:52,553 --> 00:25:55,138
a trillion people working
behind the scenes

327
00:25:55,222 --> 00:25:56,682
just to make everything shine.

328
00:25:56,765 --> 00:25:59,768
You scratch the surface of it,
and it just couldn't go on.

329
00:26:01,019 --> 00:26:03,856
And then Hari started making waves
about the collapse.

330
00:26:03,939 --> 00:26:07,484
You know, I couldn't make heads or tails
of anything he was saying.

331
00:26:07,568 --> 00:26:09,611
But you believed in the Plan.

332
00:26:09,695 --> 00:26:13,365
I believed in a girl named Mari Hardin,

333
00:26:13,448 --> 00:26:16,076
who I desperately wanted
to go to bed with.

334
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:17,536
Dad.

335
00:26:19,496 --> 00:26:21,331
She believed in the Plan.

336
00:26:21,915 --> 00:26:23,834
You joined the Foundation for a girl?

337
00:26:23,917 --> 00:26:25,377
I did.

338
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:28,005
Do you ever regret it? Coming here?

339
00:26:32,301 --> 00:26:34,303
I got you out of it, didn't I?

340
00:26:35,262 --> 00:26:36,263
Come on.

341
00:27:00,746 --> 00:27:02,247
That does not look good.

342
00:27:08,837 --> 00:27:11,340
They're setting charges
around the hydro-cells.

343
00:27:11,423 --> 00:27:12,966
It'll destroy the entire city.

344
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:16,053
We need to throw a very large wrench
into the works.

345
00:27:18,847 --> 00:27:22,059
If I could get closer, I could snipe
one of those explosive disks,

346
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,645
maybe take out a corvette or two.

347
00:27:26,813 --> 00:27:29,483
A better shot could keep her distance
and take out all three.

348
00:27:29,566 --> 00:27:30,651
Oh, Salvor.

349
00:27:30,734 --> 00:27:32,486
No. Nothing doing, Dad.

350
00:27:32,569 --> 00:27:34,696
You're too old, too fat,
and your eyesight's for shit.

351
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:35,906
You'll never make it.

352
00:27:36,907 --> 00:27:39,284
You are definitely your mother's daughter.

353
00:27:53,173 --> 00:27:55,676
Your focus and skill
are extraordinary, Empire.

354
00:27:56,426 --> 00:27:57,845
Six kills.

355
00:27:57,928 --> 00:28:01,765
Brother Dusk will be impressed.
You've broken his record.

356
00:28:01,849 --> 00:28:03,183
How many did he kill?

357
00:28:03,267 --> 00:28:04,977
On his best hunt, three.

358
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,728
And after a good deal of practice.

359
00:28:08,146 --> 00:28:10,023
Sneaky bastard.

360
00:28:11,275 --> 00:28:12,818
That would have made four.

361
00:28:13,402 --> 00:28:16,071
Throw these into the bushes.
Take them now. I killed three.

362
00:28:16,947 --> 00:28:18,949
I killed three. Do you understand? Go!

363
00:28:22,953 --> 00:28:25,664
Brother Dawn, how was your hunt?

364
00:28:26,623 --> 00:28:27,624
Three.

365
00:28:27,708 --> 00:28:30,335
You matched my record
on your first attempt.

366
00:28:30,419 --> 00:28:31,962
Romus helped considerably.

367
00:28:32,838 --> 00:28:34,339
Exceptional work, Brother Dawn.

368
00:28:34,423 --> 00:28:36,133
You're a natural hunter.

369
00:28:36,633 --> 00:28:37,759
Here, to celebrate.

370
00:28:45,517 --> 00:28:49,605
Well, you hunt like a man.
Do you consider yourself a man now?

371
00:28:50,564 --> 00:28:52,816
I don't know. I suppose?

372
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:56,361
Only a man can replace the man.

373
00:28:58,655 --> 00:29:01,867
I think it's time you paid a visit
to Gossamer Court.

374
00:29:03,702 --> 00:29:07,664
The business of Empire is challenging.

375
00:29:07,748 --> 00:29:10,042
And we are human, after all.

376
00:29:10,125 --> 00:29:15,380
We need to voice our fears,
our hatreds, our resentments.

377
00:29:16,006 --> 00:29:18,842
Their memories are wiped clean
before they leave Trantor.

378
00:29:18,926 --> 00:29:21,845
Cleon I developed the system.

379
00:29:21,929 --> 00:29:23,180
It's perfect, really.

380
00:29:24,181 --> 00:29:25,182
So?

381
00:29:27,726 --> 00:29:29,228
Which one would you like?

382
00:29:33,857 --> 00:29:36,568
What pleasures do you seek, Empire?

383
00:29:36,652 --> 00:29:38,445
You'll have no memory of this?

384
00:29:40,155 --> 00:29:42,407
None that will endure
past the night, Empire.

385
00:29:43,492 --> 00:29:46,870
I could say anything to you,

386
00:29:47,621 --> 00:29:49,122
and you won't remember tomorrow?

387
00:29:49,206 --> 00:29:50,374
That's correct.

388
00:29:51,083 --> 00:29:52,751
And that doesn't bother you?

389
00:29:53,752 --> 00:29:55,879
Memories of this liaison are not
my possession.

390
00:29:56,672 --> 00:29:58,215
They belong to Empire.

391
00:30:05,681 --> 00:30:09,726
Do you care for the pleasure of discourse?
I'm conversant in many subjects.

392
00:30:24,825 --> 00:30:25,868
Turn away.

393
00:30:39,965 --> 00:30:41,633
I'll tell them you did well.

394
00:30:43,677 --> 00:30:47,222
And as far as you'll remember, you did.

395
00:30:49,016 --> 00:30:50,559
He didn't touch me.

396
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,020
What did he do then?

397
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:56,064
He just talked.

398
00:30:58,734 --> 00:31:00,569
Tell me everything he said.

399
00:31:10,996 --> 00:31:12,247
You good, Sal?

400
00:31:12,831 --> 00:31:14,166
Almost in range now.

401
00:31:14,249 --> 00:31:16,502
Just need to take a wind reading
and I'm good to go.

402
00:31:36,396 --> 00:31:38,273
Salvor? Sal?

403
00:31:39,775 --> 00:31:41,193
- It's happened again.
- What?

404
00:31:41,276 --> 00:31:43,487
It's a mind-slip, seizure, something.

405
00:31:44,321 --> 00:31:46,448
If we don't pull her back,
they'll spot her.

406
00:31:46,532 --> 00:31:49,868
You get Salvor. I'll get the corvettes.

407
00:31:54,164 --> 00:31:57,626
There's only one scenario
in which you leave the ship as planned,

408
00:31:57,709 --> 00:32:02,130
and that's the one in which it becomes
impossible for you to remain on board.

409
00:32:02,214 --> 00:32:04,299
I don't take my life.

410
00:32:06,635 --> 00:32:07,678
You do.

411
00:32:08,679 --> 00:32:11,098
You're Hari Seldon.
You can fix this.

412
00:32:11,181 --> 00:32:12,975
I'm telling you I can't.

413
00:32:13,058 --> 00:32:14,393
Don't you see?

414
00:32:14,476 --> 00:32:20,357
This whole thing collapses
because you stay with her.

415
00:32:21,191 --> 00:32:25,320
And everything everyone has sacrificed,
all wasted.

416
00:32:26,029 --> 00:32:28,240
You know what I'm saying is true.

417
00:32:29,533 --> 00:32:30,868
Do you trust the math?

418
00:32:31,952 --> 00:32:33,120
I hate the math.

419
00:32:33,912 --> 00:32:35,205
Do you trust me?

420
00:32:35,706 --> 00:32:37,499
I wish I'd never met you,

421
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,043
never stolen your damn books.

422
00:32:41,128 --> 00:32:42,212
But you did.

423
00:32:43,046 --> 00:32:45,174
And we are here now,

424
00:32:45,841 --> 00:32:50,637
an entire galaxy pivoting around
the actions of an individual. You.

425
00:32:58,270 --> 00:33:01,773
Go straight to the cryo-pod.
It's programmed for you.

426
00:33:01,857 --> 00:33:04,318
And don't stop to say goodbye to her.

427
00:33:05,694 --> 00:33:07,487
Don't implicate her in this.

428
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:30,594
Salvor?

429
00:33:32,095 --> 00:33:34,723
- It happened again.
- I know. Can you shoot?

430
00:33:34,806 --> 00:33:36,642
- Yeah.
- Then go. Go.

431
00:34:02,543 --> 00:34:04,211
Where's my dad?

432
00:34:04,294 --> 00:34:06,755
Gone for the corvettes.
He went in after you dropped.

433
00:34:09,174 --> 00:34:10,551
He won't make it.

434
00:34:16,723 --> 00:34:18,225
There are too many.

435
00:34:47,379 --> 00:34:49,715
Keep covering me, Sal.
I'll take out those ships.

436
00:34:49,797 --> 00:34:51,592
No, Dad. No.

437
00:35:12,446 --> 00:35:13,947
Help!

438
00:35:15,282 --> 00:35:16,283
Dad!

439
00:35:22,623 --> 00:35:24,958
Salvor Hardin, Warden of Terminus.

440
00:35:25,042 --> 00:35:28,045
- Dad.
- You have to protect the Plan.

441
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:29,671
Dad, please.

442
00:35:57,533 --> 00:35:59,326
Open your fists, Salvor.

443
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:04,998
No, Daddy!

444
00:36:05,082 --> 00:36:06,792
Don't fight the wind.

445
00:36:12,714 --> 00:36:14,925
Daddy!

446
00:36:16,134 --> 00:36:17,135
No.

447
00:36:18,554 --> 00:36:20,722
No.

448
00:36:40,742 --> 00:36:42,870
You should see the view from up here.

449
00:36:48,917 --> 00:36:51,295
Empire, I... I shouldn't be here.

450
00:36:53,881 --> 00:36:56,008
Come. It's all right.

451
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:09,354
Thought you might like that.

452
00:37:25,662 --> 00:37:26,747
Parterres.

453
00:37:28,874 --> 00:37:29,917
Walkways.

454
00:37:31,627 --> 00:37:32,669
Grand lawn.

455
00:37:35,088 --> 00:37:38,425
Look how precise they are, how neat.

456
00:37:39,426 --> 00:37:41,011
Everything in its place.

457
00:37:43,805 --> 00:37:45,015
I've always loved that.

458
00:37:48,143 --> 00:37:49,770
Come see it from here.

459
00:37:57,486 --> 00:37:59,738
I don't have a force field, Empire.

460
00:38:02,157 --> 00:38:03,242
You do now.

461
00:38:18,715 --> 00:38:19,800
Take it.

462
00:38:22,511 --> 00:38:23,637
I won't if you're not.

463
00:38:32,563 --> 00:38:33,772
It's beautiful.

464
00:38:36,108 --> 00:38:38,110
If you can see beauty, it is.

465
00:38:39,987 --> 00:38:41,280
Tell me what those are.

466
00:38:44,491 --> 00:38:45,659
The rose garden?

467
00:38:46,952 --> 00:38:49,705
Rosa arvensis, then Rosa persica.

468
00:38:49,788 --> 00:38:52,165
- Rosa kordesii...
- Their colors.

469
00:38:53,208 --> 00:38:54,501
White and yellow.

470
00:38:55,335 --> 00:38:57,629
A bright yellow with a dark red center,

471
00:38:59,131 --> 00:39:01,258
and a deep, brilliant red.

472
00:39:01,341 --> 00:39:03,844
What else is that color? That red.

473
00:39:05,053 --> 00:39:06,305
In nature?

474
00:39:07,139 --> 00:39:08,765
The scarlet maple tree.

475
00:39:09,808 --> 00:39:11,476
The summer tanager bird.

476
00:39:12,269 --> 00:39:13,979
The shell of the red crab.

477
00:39:14,771 --> 00:39:16,106
Red sandalwood.

478
00:39:20,694 --> 00:39:22,905
I wasn't aware Empire was color-blind.

479
00:39:24,656 --> 00:39:26,116
Empire isn't.

480
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,243
Cleons are exact replicas.

481
00:39:29,161 --> 00:39:31,205
None has ever been color-blind...

482
00:39:34,166 --> 00:39:35,167
before me.

483
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:37,920
Isn't it fairly common in men?

484
00:39:39,338 --> 00:39:41,006
There are simple ways to correct it.

485
00:39:41,089 --> 00:39:42,424
It's not common to us.

486
00:39:44,843 --> 00:39:46,261
And none of it's simple.

487
00:39:48,013 --> 00:39:49,223
That's my secret.

488
00:39:51,892 --> 00:39:53,143
And now you know it.

489
00:39:56,063 --> 00:39:57,314
Now what do I do?

490
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:13,413
If I were trying to keep a secret,
I'd push me off.

491
00:40:13,497 --> 00:40:15,999
It's the safest way to ensure my silence.

492
00:40:24,842 --> 00:40:25,926
You could push me.

493
00:41:38,415 --> 00:41:39,666
Sal.

494
00:41:42,085 --> 00:41:44,087
He joined the Foundation for a girl.

495
00:41:48,383 --> 00:41:49,551
Isn't that strange?

496
00:41:51,678 --> 00:41:53,472
He believed in the end, but...

497
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:57,351
he did it all for my mom.

498
00:42:02,314 --> 00:42:03,607
I'm so sorry.

499
00:42:12,449 --> 00:42:14,117
I screwed up, Hugo.

500
00:42:15,744 --> 00:42:18,413
If I hadn't blacked out,
my father would still be alive.

501
00:42:18,497 --> 00:42:19,957
No.

502
00:42:20,541 --> 00:42:24,461
I was just so certain
taking their ships was the right play.

503
00:42:24,545 --> 00:42:25,754
Maybe it was.

504
00:42:26,505 --> 00:42:28,131
Maybe the other plays were worse.

505
00:42:30,133 --> 00:42:33,303
And Hari said...
He said an entire galaxy can pivot

506
00:42:33,387 --> 00:42:35,430
around the actions of an individual.

507
00:42:36,014 --> 00:42:38,141
So then you are
one of those individuals, right?

508
00:42:38,767 --> 00:42:40,894
Hari is guiding you
to keep the Plan on course.

509
00:42:42,521 --> 00:42:45,691
Because I'm, what? Special?

510
00:42:47,317 --> 00:42:50,153
The Anacreons took the city
because of me...

511
00:42:50,237 --> 00:42:53,740
No. They took it because of Lewis
and the idiots in the tower.

512
00:42:55,826 --> 00:42:57,995
And right now
the only chance the Foundation has

513
00:42:58,078 --> 00:43:00,205
of surviving this crisis is you.

514
00:43:01,915 --> 00:43:03,542
I don't care about the crisis.

515
00:43:04,459 --> 00:43:06,503
All I care about is making Phara pay.

516
00:43:08,213 --> 00:43:09,548
We just blew up her ships.

517
00:43:09,631 --> 00:43:11,508
Your rig's the only way off planet now.

518
00:43:11,592 --> 00:43:14,595
We get to the Beggar before they do,
they are stranded. Come on.

519
00:43:24,563 --> 00:43:29,193
As we mourn Proxima Opal's
compassion and her strength,

520
00:43:29,776 --> 00:43:32,237
let us be grateful for her many blessings.

521
00:43:33,238 --> 00:43:36,325
In honor of Opal's passage to rebirth,

522
00:43:36,408 --> 00:43:40,120
and as a gesture of faith
to our next Proxima,

523
00:43:40,204 --> 00:43:46,877
our esteemed Empire will be installing
a moon-wide desalination system.

524
00:43:51,715 --> 00:43:54,301
Let us now praise Empire

525
00:43:54,384 --> 00:43:58,388
and turn to the words of the New Octavo.

526
00:44:01,183 --> 00:44:03,727
"With the gifts of our protectors...

527
00:44:05,604 --> 00:44:06,772
our hearts...

528
00:44:11,235 --> 00:44:16,073
our hearts are multiplied
and our spirits emboldened.

529
00:44:16,156 --> 00:44:20,160
By the will of their souls
aligned with ours...

530
00:44:23,455 --> 00:44:24,581
our path"...

531
00:44:33,799 --> 00:44:36,426
Zephyr Gilat speaks holy words,

532
00:44:37,553 --> 00:44:39,221
and we thank her for them.

533
00:44:42,933 --> 00:44:45,477
We extend our gratitude to the Empire.

534
00:44:46,186 --> 00:44:50,232
As we celebrate Proxima Opal's
passage to her next life,

535
00:44:51,191 --> 00:44:54,987
let us take a moment to be grateful
for the Mother's gift,

536
00:44:56,029 --> 00:44:58,323
the gift of rebirth.

537
00:45:00,826 --> 00:45:03,871
There was a time, millennia ago,

538
00:45:04,997 --> 00:45:07,708
when our souls were like wax candles.

539
00:45:07,791 --> 00:45:10,544
They burned through once,
and then they were snuffed out.

540
00:45:11,461 --> 00:45:14,923
But the Mother looked down
and saw that this was insufficient.

541
00:45:15,966 --> 00:45:19,136
A single life in a single body,

542
00:45:20,137 --> 00:45:22,347
raised in a single world,

543
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:29,438
such a soul had no foothold to climb
from the trenches of ignorance

544
00:45:30,105 --> 00:45:32,232
to grow into holiness.

545
00:45:33,233 --> 00:45:37,362
And so the Mother took
that straight line of life

546
00:45:37,446 --> 00:45:39,865
and shaped it into a circle,

547
00:45:40,490 --> 00:45:43,660
bestowing upon us the gift of rebirth.

548
00:45:45,078 --> 00:45:46,788
But what does this gift mean?

549
00:45:47,289 --> 00:45:49,958
Some believe the purpose of reincarnation

550
00:45:50,042 --> 00:45:53,712
is to ascend to the highest planes
of enlightenment.

551
00:45:55,255 --> 00:45:57,049
But we know better, don't we?

552
00:45:57,132 --> 00:46:00,302
For there is no end to this journey.

553
00:46:01,094 --> 00:46:03,430
For our capacity for growth

554
00:46:04,681 --> 00:46:06,350
is infinite.

555
00:46:07,768 --> 00:46:12,064
Even a soul that appeared holy
400 years ago

556
00:46:13,273 --> 00:46:16,068
would not be holy today.

557
00:46:17,486 --> 00:46:19,988
This is the Mother's lesson.

558
00:46:20,572 --> 00:46:23,158
As the galaxy changes, so must we.

559
00:46:23,825 --> 00:46:28,038
We must embrace
the value of transformation,

560
00:46:28,121 --> 00:46:29,748
of evolution,

561
00:46:30,791 --> 00:46:32,459
of difference.

562
00:46:32,543 --> 00:46:35,420
The greatest failure of humanity,

563
00:46:35,504 --> 00:46:39,299
the greatest sin against the Mother,
is stagnation.

564
00:46:40,801 --> 00:46:42,636
And so we rejoice

565
00:46:43,428 --> 00:46:48,725
that Proxima Opal's soul will not stagnate
and rust into corruption.

566
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:54,940
We rejoice that her soul is not bound
to a single, immutable body.

567
00:46:56,316 --> 00:47:00,445
We rejoice that her soul is
an ever-transformative, evolving soul.

568
00:47:06,785 --> 00:47:09,496
Our lives in these bodies may be brief...

569
00:47:11,290 --> 00:47:14,209
but our souls are endless.

570
00:47:14,293 --> 00:47:19,590
And as we shape and sculpt our souls
into a never-ending quest for holiness,

571
00:47:19,673 --> 00:47:20,799
remember this.

572
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:27,598
This will not always be your life.
But it is your life now.

573
00:47:28,307 --> 00:47:30,851
Your choice now.

574
00:47:31,894 --> 00:47:35,022
Your change now.

575
00:47:35,981 --> 00:47:37,357
Make it count!

576
00:47:41,528 --> 00:47:42,738
To the Mother!

577
00:47:42,821 --> 00:47:44,239
To the Mother!

578
00:48:28,617 --> 00:48:29,618
Let's go.

579
00:48:50,973 --> 00:48:52,266
Kill her.

580
00:48:52,349 --> 00:48:54,059
Beggar, invoke protocol.

581
00:48:54,142 --> 00:48:56,478
Ship transfer Salvor Hardin. Lock.

582
00:48:59,523 --> 00:49:01,275
What the hell did you just do?

583
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:03,735
I slaved the ship to Salvor.

584
00:49:03,819 --> 00:49:06,405
From now on, it won't do anything
without her authorization.

585
00:49:06,488 --> 00:49:09,867
Change it back. Make her change it back!

586
00:49:10,450 --> 00:49:12,619
I locked it. Can't be changed.

587
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:16,039
So now you're stuck here
until the Empire arrives in full force.

588
00:49:16,123 --> 00:49:18,333
Reprogram it now.

589
00:49:18,417 --> 00:49:20,419
It won't listen to me.

590
00:49:20,502 --> 00:49:23,088
Thespin ships only recognize
one captain at a time.

591
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:25,591
From now on, that's her.

592
00:49:25,674 --> 00:49:27,968
So whatever bullshit
it is you're planning,

593
00:49:28,927 --> 00:49:30,721
you won't be able to do it without her.

594
00:49:31,972 --> 00:49:33,015
Then I can kill you.

595
00:49:33,098 --> 00:49:36,226
Don't be an idiot. I don't know
the first thing about piloting a ship.

596
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:39,104
I need him riding shotgun.

597
00:49:39,188 --> 00:49:40,439
You need him.

598
00:49:51,408 --> 00:49:54,912
Guess you get to see
the stars after all, Warden.

599
00:50:05,047 --> 00:50:07,508
You have space suits here?

600
00:50:07,591 --> 00:50:09,301
From your time on the Deliverance?

601
00:50:09,384 --> 00:50:11,637
Yes, but they're 30 years old.

602
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:12,930
They'll have to do.

603
00:50:16,016 --> 00:50:17,726
Understand me.

604
00:50:17,809 --> 00:50:21,313
We are leaving the rest of our troops
here as leverage.

605
00:50:21,396 --> 00:50:26,401
If you fail to follow our orders,
if you defy our Huntress in any way,

606
00:50:27,694 --> 00:50:31,949
weigh your fate against those
of your loved ones and act accordingly.

607
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:36,203
- Lewis.
- Dara.

608
00:50:42,543 --> 00:50:45,379
It's all right, my love.
Just do whatever they ask.

609
00:50:45,963 --> 00:50:47,089
Please, don't do...

610
00:50:48,257 --> 00:50:49,424
Please.

611
00:50:50,509 --> 00:50:52,261
Get off. Let go.

612
00:50:54,304 --> 00:50:55,764
Mommy!

613
00:51:04,273 --> 00:51:05,482
Where's your father?

614
00:51:08,944 --> 00:51:10,028
Where's Abbas?

615
00:51:12,322 --> 00:51:16,159
Mom, I'm so sorry. I tried. I tried.

616
00:51:56,909 --> 00:51:58,118
Take us up there.

617
00:51:58,202 --> 00:52:00,829
Like I said, it's Salvor's ship now.

618
00:52:03,999 --> 00:52:05,918
Just grab the controls and trust yourself.

619
00:52:06,835 --> 00:52:07,920
I got it.

620
00:52:11,006 --> 00:52:13,133
Please enter your destination.

621
00:52:13,926 --> 00:52:15,886
The ship's asking for coordinates.

622
00:52:15,969 --> 00:52:17,554
You wanna tell us where we're going?

623
00:52:18,138 --> 00:52:19,389
The Anthor Belt.

624
00:52:21,475 --> 00:52:23,477
Strap in. Takeoffs can be rough.

625
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:24,603
I'm happy here.

626
00:52:27,189 --> 00:52:29,274
The Belt's coordinates are stored
in the Beggar's nav

627
00:52:29,358 --> 00:52:30,943
from when I used to do mining runs.

628
00:52:31,610 --> 00:52:33,654
Get us out of the atmosphere,
and we'll be fine.

629
00:52:50,128 --> 00:52:51,171
We're ready.

630
00:52:51,255 --> 00:52:52,339
And engines.

631
00:53:05,310 --> 00:53:06,478
Easy.

632
00:53:16,154 --> 00:53:17,447
Are we okay?

633
00:53:18,991 --> 00:53:21,326
Let the stick tell you
what the ship wants to do.

634
00:53:21,410 --> 00:53:23,954
You're not controlling it.
It's a cooperation.

635
00:53:24,037 --> 00:53:26,999
If I'm not controlling it,
then they shouldn't call them controls.

636
00:53:32,129 --> 00:53:34,673
Increase thrust 20%.
Compensate for the eastern wind shear.

637
00:53:36,884 --> 00:53:38,010
Boosters increased.

638
00:53:43,682 --> 00:53:46,018
Good job. We're out of the woods.

639
00:53:48,270 --> 00:53:49,521
Crowns.

639
00:53:50,305 --> 00:54:50,945
