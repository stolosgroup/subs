2
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:32,050
Ask a historian,
"What was mankind's greatest invention?"

3
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:35,470
Fire? The wheel? The sword?

4
00:01:35,554 --> 00:01:37,848
I would argue it's history itself.

5
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:40,142
History isn't fact.

6
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:44,062
It's narrative,
one carefully curated and shaped.

7
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:46,982
Under the pen strokes of the right scribe,

8
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:48,525
a villain becomes a hero,

9
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:52,154
a lie becomes the truth.

10
00:01:54,198 --> 00:01:55,782
- Daddy?
- Yeah?

11
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:58,452
- Where did we come from?
- Trantor.

12
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:01,538
No, before that.

13
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:05,334
Where did people come from
in the beginning?

14
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:07,377
There are lots of different theories.

15
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:12,549
Most of them say that humans originally
inhabited a single planetary system.

16
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:13,800
Only one?

17
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:18,680
And we don't even know which.
Sirius, Alpha Centauri...

18
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:21,350
Some people think that we came
from some place called Earth.

19
00:02:21,934 --> 00:02:23,310
Come here. Come.

20
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:26,897
So, everyone we know about,

21
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:31,902
they also came from the same place?
Anacreons and Thespins too?

22
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:34,488
Anacreons and Thespins too, yeah.

23
00:02:35,781 --> 00:02:37,282
Then how can they hate us?

24
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:44,081
Being human is complicated, Sal.

25
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:49,002
We share a common origin
and some of the same myths.

26
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:51,922
But we're governed by this.

27
00:02:52,464 --> 00:02:56,385
In here is all the capacity
for rational thinking,

28
00:02:57,135 --> 00:03:00,764
but it's sharing skull space
with our emotions.

29
00:03:01,974 --> 00:03:05,602
And sometimes
emotions shout louder than logic.

30
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:12,109
And somebody's emotions got real insistent
that the Empire were doing them wrong.

31
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,069
So they blew up the Star Bridge.

32
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:16,113
Yeah.

33
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:23,954
Violence is the last refuge
of the incompetent.

34
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:27,583
So, they're not like us
at all then, right?

35
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,669
It gets loud up inside here too,
doesn't it?

36
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:32,087
I guess it does.

37
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,673
Come here. Come here.

38
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:37,426
Here's the thing, Sal.

39
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:48,270
Millions of people died
when that Star Bridge came down.

40
00:03:50,022 --> 00:03:56,236
And the Empire killed many millions more
on Anacreon and Thespis.

41
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:57,988
And who won?

42
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,823
- Nobody?
- Nobody.

43
00:04:01,283 --> 00:04:04,828
And that's how we know
that the fall is bound to happen.

44
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:11,752
Past behavior is the best predictor
of future performance.

45
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,505
Salvor Hardin...

46
00:04:21,345 --> 00:04:22,679
We're jumping.

47
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:13,814
Lewis?

48
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,695
Lewis, where are you?

49
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,742
Terminus?

50
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:27,744
We're home.

51
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,665
We jumped back home.

52
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:36,170
Lewis?

53
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:52,811
Damn it.

54
00:05:57,191 --> 00:05:58,734
You saved us.

55
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:01,570
You wished us home.

56
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:45,155
Thank you.

57
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:11,431
Terminus Control, this is Salvor Hardin,
on board the imperial warship Invictus.

58
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:13,100
Do you read me?

59
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:16,687
Terminus Control, do you read me?

60
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,313
This is Salvor Hardin.

61
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:22,109
Can anybody hear me?

62
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:47,593
This is Salvor Hardin calling
the Thespin lancers.

63
00:07:47,676 --> 00:07:52,097
The Invictus jumped and we've dragged
your ships into our quantum wake.

64
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,184
We're in orbit around Terminus.

65
00:07:57,936 --> 00:08:02,441
If you can hear me, I have no idea
how to stop this ship from jumping again.

66
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:06,528
It could be an hour from now.
It could be days.

67
00:08:08,864 --> 00:08:10,699
I figure I'm stuck here, unless...

68
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:36,099
The Beggar.

69
00:08:39,061 --> 00:08:40,479
How do you get home?

70
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:43,899
Take me through your route.

71
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:49,446
Where does this corridor go?

72
00:08:50,072 --> 00:08:51,823
The underground irrigation system.

73
00:08:51,907 --> 00:08:56,078
But there's a path above it you could take
through the old palace ruins.

74
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:58,956
You end up at the servants' exit,
right next to the palace gates.

75
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,249
So, if I could exit here...

76
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:02,584
Hyperloop station's just there.

77
00:09:02,668 --> 00:09:04,920
Gate security has DNA scanners.

78
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:10,884
I'll need the signal damper.
For my nanobots. So they can't track me.

79
00:09:10,968 --> 00:09:12,386
I think I can get you one.

80
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:16,807
I don't wanna die in this place.

81
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:19,935
You won't.

82
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:24,064
I can't promise it'll all go right.

83
00:09:24,857 --> 00:09:27,317
All I can promise is
I won't be the part that goes wrong.

84
00:09:29,695 --> 00:09:31,154
I have to go. Brother Dusk is...

85
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:32,281
Cleon...

86
00:09:33,282 --> 00:09:36,577
I wish you had another name.
One that was just yours.

87
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,372
Tomorrow you can give me one.

88
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:52,718
Get me that signal damper,
and I'll see you on the other side.

89
00:10:00,851 --> 00:10:02,728
My apologies, Brother Dusk. I was...

90
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:06,565
I understand.
Time flows differently when you're young.

91
00:10:08,025 --> 00:10:10,944
I want to share something with you.

92
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:17,492
This is my workplace, as you know.

93
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:24,541
The signature task of Dusk
is to record our visual history.

94
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:28,504
The end of the Robot Wars.

95
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:32,799
The Golden Horse Rebellion.

96
00:10:32,883 --> 00:10:37,346
Each moment an inflection point
for our dynasty,

97
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:41,558
when the fate of the galaxy
seemed to be hanging in the balance.

98
00:10:45,521 --> 00:10:46,980
As it did here...

99
00:10:52,778 --> 00:10:57,616
when I chastened the barbarian worlds
for their acts of savagery.

100
00:10:57,699 --> 00:10:59,284
And even while I was painting it,

101
00:10:59,368 --> 00:11:05,624
I was conscious of how we, as its authors,
would be represented.

102
00:11:07,918 --> 00:11:12,339
A clever artist provides commentary
with his work.

103
00:11:13,966 --> 00:11:19,721
Even something as simple
as a choice of color

104
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:23,058
can convey a hidden meaning.

105
00:11:24,226 --> 00:11:27,771
And sometimes the moment's not so obvious.

106
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,649
Sometimes it slips past us,

107
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:33,527
and you don't even realize it
until it is past,

108
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:38,323
until your debut on the wall is upon you.

109
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:43,579
I've painted you into our legacy.

110
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:54,923
Our hunt.

111
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,636
Do you see
the three ghillie raptors you shot?

112
00:12:03,432 --> 00:12:04,683
Of course.

113
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:08,687
I've dreamed of one day doing something,

114
00:12:09,271 --> 00:12:11,899
anything, worthy enough
to be included in this mural.

115
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:15,861
I don't know why this small feat is...

116
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:22,409
I'm honored. Thank you.

117
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:29,166
I knew you had
the greatness of Cleon I in you.

118
00:12:32,628 --> 00:12:34,171
But during our hunt,

119
00:12:35,714 --> 00:12:41,386
I realized there was something else
inside you as well.

120
00:12:43,347 --> 00:12:47,309
I'll leave you to reflect
on your own glorious moment.

121
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:49,520
Take your time.

122
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:53,273
Appreciate the subtleties.

123
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:37,651
What we choose
to tell our children and what we censor.

124
00:13:40,195 --> 00:13:43,073
What we illuminate and what we gloss over.

125
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:50,414
History as an act
of addition and subtraction.

126
00:14:27,451 --> 00:14:31,830
Empire, you're needed
in the Principium Tower.

127
00:14:33,415 --> 00:14:35,083
I can't. I'm busy.

128
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:37,085
Brother Dusk insists.

129
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:39,296
I'm indisposed.

130
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:42,341
I need a minute alone,
and I'll come along. One minute.

131
00:14:43,509 --> 00:14:44,843
I am also Empire, you know.

132
00:14:45,427 --> 00:14:46,512
Yes, Empire.

133
00:14:47,471 --> 00:14:48,972
But we both serve.

134
00:15:03,237 --> 00:15:06,114
I forgot something. I need to go back.

135
00:15:08,075 --> 00:15:09,076
It can wait.

136
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:03,797
Lock down the entrance.

137
00:16:09,094 --> 00:16:10,888
Don't let anyone in or out.

138
00:16:12,055 --> 00:16:14,349
There's a path you can take
through the palace ruins.

139
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:21,899
You end up at the servants' exit,
right next to the palace gates.

140
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:28,030
This route takes you
to the underground irrigation system.

141
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:31,283
Hyperloop station's just there.

142
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:32,826
Spread out.

143
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:07,986
Warning. Water cycling imminent.

144
00:17:08,904 --> 00:17:11,323
Warning. Water cycling imminent.

145
00:17:50,153 --> 00:17:52,030
Four moons, that's a long jump.

146
00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:57,578
Go.

147
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,081
Beggar, wake the hell up.

148
00:18:43,624 --> 00:18:45,876
Welcome aboard, Captain Hardin.

149
00:19:57,656 --> 00:19:58,657
Excuse me?

150
00:20:09,293 --> 00:20:13,297
It's an imperial aura. For your jacket?

151
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:35,360
Can you tell me how to get
to the Desnian Sector on level 33?

152
00:20:35,444 --> 00:20:41,200
Take the Cobalt Line down,
then transfer to Ery Loop.

153
00:20:43,327 --> 00:20:45,120
You wanna head inner core.

154
00:20:56,548 --> 00:20:58,634
Beggar, open a channel
to Terminus Control.

155
00:20:58,717 --> 00:21:00,427
Communications channel open.

156
00:21:00,511 --> 00:21:02,638
Terminus Control,
this is Salvor Hardin. Come in.

157
00:21:05,557 --> 00:21:06,558
Damn it.

158
00:21:07,935 --> 00:21:10,145
Beggar, scan all frequencies.
Find me anyone on comms.

159
00:21:10,229 --> 00:21:11,230
Scanning.

160
00:21:14,441 --> 00:21:15,859
No active comms detected

161
00:21:15,943 --> 00:21:17,486
on the surface of Terminus.

162
00:21:24,952 --> 00:21:26,036
You found someone?

163
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:29,498
Caution. Anomalous debris
on potential intercept trajectory.

164
00:21:29,581 --> 00:21:30,874
Threat level low.

165
00:21:34,127 --> 00:21:35,379
What the hell is that?

166
00:21:35,462 --> 00:21:38,715
Alert. Anomalous debris
on confirmed intercept trajectory.

167
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:39,800
Threat level moderate.

168
00:21:40,384 --> 00:21:41,844
I need guns. Where are the guns?

169
00:21:43,846 --> 00:21:44,888
Beggar, show me the guns.

170
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,643
Warning. Anomalous debris
object impact imminent.

171
00:21:49,726 --> 00:21:52,020
Threat level severe. Warning.

172
00:21:52,104 --> 00:21:53,105
Target locked.

173
00:21:54,022 --> 00:21:56,191
Babe? Babe, are you there?

174
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:58,652
Hugo, is that you?

175
00:22:13,792 --> 00:22:15,085
Our plan worked, Sal.

176
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,882
How'd you get here from the Belt?

177
00:22:20,716 --> 00:22:22,009
Luck, mostly.

178
00:22:22,092 --> 00:22:26,096
I made contact with Thespin Command.
I rode shotgun on one of the lancers.

179
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:30,184
And then I could see
the Invictus was about to jump,

180
00:22:30,267 --> 00:22:34,521
so I grabbed a sedation stick
and knocked myself out for the jump.

181
00:22:34,605 --> 00:22:36,899
Warned the rest of my people
to do the same.

182
00:22:40,402 --> 00:22:42,613
And I woke up to the dulcet tones
of your voice.

183
00:22:45,949 --> 00:22:48,285
But I don't understand
how you woke up so quickly.

184
00:22:48,368 --> 00:22:50,954
I never went to sleep.
It's like the Vault.

185
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:53,999
I can't explain how or why,
but the jump just didn't affect me.

186
00:22:54,082 --> 00:22:55,834
So you got us back to Terminus?

187
00:22:55,918 --> 00:22:59,129
No, that was Lewis.
He died to get us back.

188
00:22:59,213 --> 00:23:01,048
And the Foundation's not responding?

189
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,092
No one is,

190
00:23:05,677 --> 00:23:07,763
not even the Anacreons Phara left behind.

191
00:23:10,974 --> 00:23:12,559
It's the null field.

192
00:23:12,643 --> 00:23:14,394
I can feel it, Hugo.

193
00:23:16,271 --> 00:23:21,360
It's... even bigger. It's... louder.

194
00:23:21,443 --> 00:23:23,695
It's like it's enveloped the whole planet.

195
00:23:26,281 --> 00:23:27,533
I have to stop it.

196
00:23:28,116 --> 00:23:29,159
Are you crazy?

197
00:23:30,994 --> 00:23:32,746
What if they're all dead down there?

198
00:23:33,997 --> 00:23:36,166
What if we just left? Right now.

199
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:38,269
We'll make a run for the Red Corridor.

200
00:23:38,293 --> 00:23:40,188
I'll show you Irina Four,
I'll show you Hesperus...

201
00:23:40,212 --> 00:23:41,547
I can't, Hugo.

202
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:43,882
What if there is no solution
to this crisis?

203
00:23:45,217 --> 00:23:46,552
What if Seldon got it wrong?

204
00:23:58,397 --> 00:24:01,233
I have to see this through, Hugo.

205
00:24:05,195 --> 00:24:06,530
I have to fix this.

206
00:24:13,996 --> 00:24:15,330
What do you want me to do?

207
00:24:18,834 --> 00:24:23,130
The Invictus is gonna jump again
unless your people can disable its drives.

208
00:24:23,213 --> 00:24:25,733
Then let it jump. Let it take Phara.
It'll be out of our lives forever.

209
00:24:25,757 --> 00:24:26,758
No.

210
00:24:27,259 --> 00:24:29,136
The Foundation needs that ship.

211
00:24:31,513 --> 00:24:33,015
It's the way we end the crisis.

212
00:24:34,683 --> 00:24:37,060
- I can't tell you how...
- I just have a feeling.

213
00:24:43,609 --> 00:24:47,279
You said you have absolute faith in me.

214
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:51,533
You still believe that?

215
00:24:55,954 --> 00:24:58,874
Be kind of a dick
if I changed my mind now, wouldn't I?

216
00:25:12,971 --> 00:25:14,211
I'll see you on the other side.

217
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:26,401
I love you.

218
00:25:27,444 --> 00:25:28,570
Me too.

219
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:54,638
You've lived every moment
of your life with people watching you.

220
00:25:55,848 --> 00:25:57,808
The Scar's different.

221
00:25:58,475 --> 00:26:00,018
You can lose yourself in it.

222
00:26:01,895 --> 00:26:04,273
For Empire, the Scar represents a failure.

223
00:26:04,857 --> 00:26:07,943
For the rest of Trantor,
it represents an opportunity.

224
00:26:09,236 --> 00:26:10,821
For the first time in centuries,

225
00:26:10,904 --> 00:26:15,158
we can look up and see
real clouds, real stars,

226
00:26:16,326 --> 00:26:19,663
not a simulation run by servers
designed to keep us complacent.

227
00:26:32,176 --> 00:26:36,221
I live on level 33,
in the Desnian Sector.

228
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,102
Old Tertia makes the best
spiced malkas on the planet.

229
00:26:48,358 --> 00:26:50,152
This is the corridor I take home.

230
00:26:53,947 --> 00:26:55,782
It's nothing like your palace.

231
00:26:57,409 --> 00:26:59,119
It's chaotic. It's crowded.

232
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,462
But it's alive.

233
00:27:12,174 --> 00:27:13,467
And it's waiting for you.

234
00:27:35,364 --> 00:27:36,365
I couldn't wait.

235
00:28:01,932 --> 00:28:03,433
You're not wearing your aura.

236
00:28:05,185 --> 00:28:09,815
I traded it for this,
so I wouldn't be recognized.

237
00:28:12,234 --> 00:28:13,527
The jacket's smart.

238
00:28:15,404 --> 00:28:16,446
Now we can burn it.

239
00:28:30,002 --> 00:28:34,214
We need to get my nanobots removed
in case they're tracking me. I...

240
00:28:35,424 --> 00:28:37,676
I probably shouldn't even stay here.

241
00:28:38,594 --> 00:28:40,846
It's okay. I got the signal damper.

242
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,682
That'll cover you until we can arrange to...

243
00:28:48,312 --> 00:28:49,313
Hey.

244
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:53,150
The hardest part's over.

245
00:28:59,114 --> 00:29:00,532
You got away from them.

246
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:03,911
You're here.

247
00:29:11,043 --> 00:29:12,753
But, truthfully...

248
00:29:14,004 --> 00:29:15,506
you still smell terrible.

249
00:29:19,551 --> 00:29:21,053
Why don't you shower?

250
00:29:50,082 --> 00:29:52,709
Hey, I was thinking
about a new name for me.

251
00:29:59,258 --> 00:30:00,259
Azura?

252
00:30:11,937 --> 00:30:12,980
What is that for?

253
00:31:19,004 --> 00:31:20,924
According to Salvor,
the engine room is that way.

254
00:31:24,551 --> 00:31:28,180
We've got about thirty-three hours
to disable the jumpdrives.

255
00:31:29,681 --> 00:31:32,768
What happened here?

256
00:31:34,186 --> 00:31:38,190
A long and terrible story
that no one's alive to tell...

257
00:31:38,649 --> 00:31:39,858
Anacreons, where?

258
00:31:40,651 --> 00:31:44,530
The bridge.
Salvor has them tied up in there.

259
00:31:45,572 --> 00:31:46,573
All clear.

260
00:32:01,171 --> 00:32:03,006
A wise man once said,

261
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:06,134
"A people without history
is like a tree without roots."

262
00:32:10,055 --> 00:32:12,641
What's missing
from the wise man's history?

263
00:32:12,724 --> 00:32:14,560
When did story replace record?

264
00:32:19,231 --> 00:32:22,192
When all the facts
fall short of believability,

265
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:25,654
fantasy feels reassuringly solid.

266
00:32:26,905 --> 00:32:29,074
And since this is my history,

267
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:32,327
I get to decide
which parts have been subtracted,

268
00:32:33,662 --> 00:32:34,997
which have been added.

269
00:34:01,124 --> 00:34:02,125
Jord?

270
00:35:09,902 --> 00:35:12,571
Mom? Mom?

271
00:35:14,406 --> 00:35:17,242
Mom. Mom, wake up, it's me.

272
00:35:19,578 --> 00:35:21,622
Mom. Mom, wake up, it's me.

273
00:35:39,806 --> 00:35:41,016
Can you make anything of it?

274
00:36:09,044 --> 00:36:11,797
Fine. I'll figure it out myself.

275
00:36:35,821 --> 00:36:37,656
Open your fists, Salvor.

276
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:41,326
Open your fists, Salvor.

277
00:36:41,994 --> 00:36:42,995
Come on.

278
00:37:00,721 --> 00:37:01,972
Can you make anything of it?

279
00:37:02,556 --> 00:37:05,184
Salvor, if you were part of the Plan,

280
00:37:05,267 --> 00:37:07,853
it would make it a lot easier
for me to believe in all this.

281
00:37:23,035 --> 00:37:24,953
How long did it take you...

282
00:37:25,871 --> 00:37:27,456
to trigger the Prime Radiant?

283
00:37:27,998 --> 00:37:29,249
Got it on the second try.

284
00:37:45,516 --> 00:37:50,103
History is the ultimate weapon,
because it harnesses time itself.

285
00:37:50,896 --> 00:37:54,858
Used correctly,
the past can alter the present.

286
00:37:56,276 --> 00:37:57,903
What other invention can do that?

287
00:38:51,999 --> 00:38:53,292
Salvor?

288
00:38:53,375 --> 00:38:54,376
Mom?

289
00:39:01,925 --> 00:39:03,969
- I thought I'd never see you again.
- Me too.

290
00:39:14,396 --> 00:39:17,399
The null field, it's stopped.

291
00:39:27,117 --> 00:39:28,202
Did you do this?

292
00:39:37,961 --> 00:39:39,129
Is that a door?

293
00:39:43,133 --> 00:39:44,593
I think so.

294
00:39:44,676 --> 00:39:46,094
So, what now?

295
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:50,057
Now is where it ends.

296
00:40:00,859 --> 00:40:02,528
Did you find the Huntress?

297
00:40:02,945 --> 00:40:04,279
We searched the entire ship.

298
00:40:04,655 --> 00:40:05,864
No sign of her.

299
00:40:06,907 --> 00:40:08,742
Except this.

300
00:40:10,244 --> 00:40:12,663
Then we get down to Terminus
as fast as possible.

301
00:40:13,747 --> 00:40:16,583
Obsidian, open a channel
to Arkose and Gneiss.

302
00:40:16,667 --> 00:40:19,127
Communications channel open.

303
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,672
This is Thespin Command.

304
00:40:22,548 --> 00:40:26,426
I want all lancers planet-side
immediately.

305
00:40:27,719 --> 00:40:29,972
Which one of you is this ship slave to?

306
00:40:36,186 --> 00:40:40,065
Slave this ship to Phara Keaen,
or you die too.

307
00:40:40,148 --> 00:40:44,903
Arkose, invoke protocol.
Ship transfer, Phara Keaen.

308
00:40:57,207 --> 00:40:58,709
Heart rate's rising.

309
00:41:02,254 --> 00:41:05,799
If it gets to 120,
then the bots go into crisis mode.

310
00:41:07,467 --> 00:41:09,136
I'll increase the inhibitors.

311
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:11,305
Pulse is stabilizing.

312
00:41:16,268 --> 00:41:17,978
Start the transfer now.

313
00:41:55,098 --> 00:41:57,518
We're transferring your nanobots
into my blood.

314
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,521
That's what you wanted, isn't it?

315
00:42:01,688 --> 00:42:03,190
To have them removed?

316
00:42:03,273 --> 00:42:04,399
Who are you?

317
00:42:04,483 --> 00:42:07,528
A Dawn clone, obviously.

318
00:42:07,611 --> 00:42:09,613
Superficially identical to you.

319
00:42:11,532 --> 00:42:13,325
But how are you...

320
00:42:13,408 --> 00:42:16,954
Here? Instead of floating in an aquarium?

321
00:42:19,081 --> 00:42:22,501
Our people managed to smuggle
some of Cleon I's DNA out of the palace.

322
00:42:23,418 --> 00:42:25,337
We've been working
towards this day for decades.

323
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:28,966
You surprised us.
We'd planned to have you escape tomorrow.

324
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:31,343
Where's Azura?

325
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:44,565
This was all a trap.

326
00:42:46,441 --> 00:42:47,985
How could you do this to me?

327
00:42:49,194 --> 00:42:50,195
You?

328
00:42:51,321 --> 00:42:52,948
This is about the rest of the galaxy,

329
00:42:53,532 --> 00:42:56,660
all the planets and people who've
been crushed under the Empire's heel.

330
00:42:56,743 --> 00:42:57,870
It's not his fault.

331
00:42:59,329 --> 00:43:00,706
It's how he was raised.

332
00:43:02,291 --> 00:43:04,543
He and his brothers have always been told

333
00:43:04,626 --> 00:43:08,463
they are the light that never dims,
an unbroken chain.

334
00:43:10,674 --> 00:43:13,719
Reality just doesn't penetrate
their little terrarium.

335
00:43:14,595 --> 00:43:16,763
I don't know how you're gonna stomach it.

336
00:43:16,847 --> 00:43:17,848
I'll be fine.

337
00:43:18,849 --> 00:43:20,851
I've been practicing my role long enough,

338
00:43:21,935 --> 00:43:24,605
the cloistered little tyrant
in the making...

339
00:43:27,649 --> 00:43:32,821
projecting that subtle air
of self-pitying, arrogant indifference.

340
00:43:35,824 --> 00:43:39,828
Practicing? What are you talking about?

341
00:43:40,370 --> 00:43:43,290
"Practicing? What are you talking about?"

342
00:43:44,958 --> 00:43:46,793
I'm your understudy, Dawn.

343
00:43:46,877 --> 00:43:49,379
And now it's time
for me to take center stage.

344
00:43:49,963 --> 00:43:51,924
I'm going to go back to the palace,

345
00:43:53,258 --> 00:43:54,760
and I'm gonna be you.

346
00:43:56,386 --> 00:43:59,181
They'll just kill you then.
They know I'm different.

347
00:43:59,264 --> 00:44:01,099
Right, but...

348
00:44:02,518 --> 00:44:03,644
I'm not.

349
00:44:04,394 --> 00:44:08,023
I'm not color-blind. I'm not left-handed.

350
00:44:08,774 --> 00:44:11,902
I'm genetically identical to Cleon I.

351
00:44:14,071 --> 00:44:15,072
And I can prove it.

352
00:44:15,155 --> 00:44:17,407
I don't understand.

353
00:44:18,534 --> 00:44:20,869
How can you be identical to the first,
and I'm not?

354
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:24,998
"Magnetic nanoparticle transfection"
is the technical term.

355
00:44:25,582 --> 00:44:27,417
It's all a little over my head,

356
00:44:27,501 --> 00:44:30,170
but, basically, they altered your DNA
after the fact.

357
00:44:30,254 --> 00:44:34,341
Like I said, this has been planned since
before you or I took our first breath.

358
00:44:34,842 --> 00:44:37,469
Our people knew they had to get you
out of the palace,

359
00:44:38,637 --> 00:44:40,222
but they couldn't just take you.

360
00:44:40,931 --> 00:44:42,432
That would've been too risky.

361
00:44:43,058 --> 00:44:45,936
They had to make it
so you'd choose to leave.

362
00:44:47,229 --> 00:44:51,358
You needed a motive to run.
And what better motive than survival?

363
00:44:54,194 --> 00:44:58,031
We're the ones
who made you different, Empire.

364
00:45:00,158 --> 00:45:02,244
In a certain way, you're lucky too.

365
00:45:02,327 --> 00:45:05,581
The Genetic Dynasty's
an affront to humanity,

366
00:45:05,664 --> 00:45:06,944
and you're no longer part of it.

367
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:09,877
You never really were.

368
00:45:11,670 --> 00:45:13,422
The transfer's complete.

369
00:45:40,616 --> 00:45:42,451
You had no choice in any of this...

370
00:45:44,161 --> 00:45:45,829
but thank you just the same.

371
00:45:56,798 --> 00:45:58,258
Get him up.

372
00:46:01,887 --> 00:46:03,555
What are you gonna do to me?

373
00:46:03,639 --> 00:46:04,765
What do you think, Cleon?

374
00:46:30,290 --> 00:46:31,792
Azura. Azura, this way.

375
00:46:52,062 --> 00:46:53,063
Empire.

376
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:57,860
Brother Dusk! I am so grateful.

377
00:47:01,738 --> 00:47:04,116
I want a full memory audit
of all the dead.

378
00:47:04,199 --> 00:47:05,242
And the girl?

379
00:47:06,451 --> 00:47:08,912
The girl. Yes.

380
00:47:13,250 --> 00:47:15,085
Quite a performance.

381
00:47:16,003 --> 00:47:18,755
It was a pleasure to observe it,

382
00:47:20,048 --> 00:47:23,760
tailored though it was
to the young and foolish.

383
00:47:33,687 --> 00:47:35,957
You didn't really think
we'd let this drone leave the palace

384
00:47:35,981 --> 00:47:37,900
without alerting us, did you?

385
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:42,946
We followed your whole
enticing travelogue home, my dear.

386
00:47:51,163 --> 00:47:53,290
You let him get away
so he would lead you to us.

387
00:47:54,124 --> 00:47:55,125
Shroud her.

388
00:48:16,188 --> 00:48:17,731
You got what you wanted then.

389
00:48:19,024 --> 00:48:21,693
Never presume to understand what I want.

390
00:48:27,407 --> 00:48:31,245
You are stupid, naive, gullible.

391
00:48:31,995 --> 00:48:33,288
So was I at your age.

392
00:48:33,914 --> 00:48:35,582
And these things are forgivable.

393
00:48:35,666 --> 00:48:39,586
But the matter of your... difference,

394
00:48:41,129 --> 00:48:42,589
that's rather more complicated.

395
00:48:42,673 --> 00:48:44,633
But you must've heard them.

396
00:48:45,676 --> 00:48:48,345
I'm a victim. We all are.

397
00:48:48,428 --> 00:48:49,805
Yes.

398
00:48:49,888 --> 00:48:54,268
And that makes you
the embodiment of our vulnerability,

399
00:48:54,351 --> 00:48:56,979
an ugly reminder of the knife-edge

400
00:48:57,062 --> 00:49:00,607
upon which
our Genetic Dynasty is balanced.

401
00:49:01,358 --> 00:49:06,738
By what logic would we want
to look on your face ever again?

402
00:49:08,198 --> 00:49:09,241
My face?

403
00:49:12,077 --> 00:49:13,620
My face is your face.

404
00:49:14,663 --> 00:49:18,625
Forget logic. Try empathy.

405
00:49:27,467 --> 00:49:29,261
Wait, wait, wait.

406
00:49:29,344 --> 00:49:32,514
Surely it's not up to you. It's up to Day.

407
00:49:33,849 --> 00:49:34,850
True.

408
00:49:35,475 --> 00:49:37,102
Brother Day will be home soon.

409
00:49:37,895 --> 00:49:39,438
You can plead your case to him.

410
00:49:40,689 --> 00:49:44,860
I doubt his experience on the Maiden
has made him serene.

411
00:49:55,037 --> 00:49:57,456
Warden, you made it back!

412
00:49:57,539 --> 00:49:59,124
Keep your distance, you two.

413
00:49:59,208 --> 00:50:01,376
But everyone's waking up. It's over.

414
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:02,961
It's not over.

415
00:50:03,045 --> 00:50:04,546
Salvor, wait. Don't go in there.

416
00:50:04,630 --> 00:50:06,215
I have to, Mom.

417
00:50:07,758 --> 00:50:09,551
You will not! Step away.

418
00:50:10,177 --> 00:50:13,388
You said this wasn't a trick,
that you didn't know what this was.

419
00:50:13,472 --> 00:50:14,473
We don't.

420
00:50:14,556 --> 00:50:17,809
And yet your daughter has tamed it.
How do you explain that?

421
00:51:22,332 --> 00:51:24,459
Sorry, Sal.
I tried to talk 'em out of landing.

422
00:51:25,127 --> 00:51:26,962
No, this makes sense.

423
00:51:27,045 --> 00:51:31,466
This is where I'm supposed to be.
Everything converging in a single crisis.

424
00:51:31,550 --> 00:51:33,594
Where is our Huntress?

425
00:51:35,721 --> 00:51:37,639
She lost control of the Invictus.

426
00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:42,561
Your plans for martyrdom, for Trantor,
they're done.

427
00:51:43,228 --> 00:51:44,438
Rowan?

428
00:51:45,314 --> 00:51:47,649
The Weald Gods have forsaken us.

429
00:52:17,346 --> 00:52:18,972
Oh, hammered shit.

430
00:52:33,529 --> 00:52:37,366
Well, isn't this a pretty picture?

431
00:52:37,950 --> 00:52:42,079
Enemies old and new,
conveniently gathered in one place.

432
00:52:46,375 --> 00:52:49,294
Drop your weapons and unbind him.

433
00:52:57,094 --> 00:53:01,765
And you, Warden, don't even think
about flashing that coin of yours.

434
00:53:02,432 --> 00:53:05,853
I'm glad you're alive, Phara, truly.

435
00:53:07,771 --> 00:53:08,772
I need you to hear this.

436
00:53:08,856 --> 00:53:12,276
Last thing I'm interested in hearing
is more words from you.

437
00:53:12,359 --> 00:53:15,821
Phara, please. The jump induces psychosis.
You're not thinking straight.

438
00:53:15,904 --> 00:53:17,573
I'm thinking just fine.

439
00:53:25,205 --> 00:53:26,373
Also aiming.

440
00:53:26,456 --> 00:53:28,959
Look, if you don't like
what I have to say,

441
00:53:29,668 --> 00:53:33,422
you can kill me when I'm done.
You can kill all of us.

442
00:53:33,505 --> 00:53:35,007
I will.

443
00:53:37,009 --> 00:53:38,385
That ship...

444
00:53:40,262 --> 00:53:44,641
is the most powerful weapon
your people will ever get their hands on.

445
00:53:45,475 --> 00:53:47,895
If that's the case, why destroy it?

446
00:53:49,813 --> 00:53:52,399
- Why not use it for leverage?
- How?

447
00:53:52,482 --> 00:53:55,652
We band together, all three worlds.

448
00:53:55,736 --> 00:53:57,112
Stop moving!

449
00:54:00,032 --> 00:54:01,783
We can share the Invictus.

450
00:54:01,867 --> 00:54:05,662
We can repair it, together.

451
00:54:06,997 --> 00:54:11,043
All we have to do is let our logic speak
louder than our emotions.

452
00:54:16,673 --> 00:54:17,674
Phara, stop.

453
00:54:20,093 --> 00:54:24,890
You would take up arms
against your own Huntress?

454
00:54:24,973 --> 00:54:26,934
The hunt is over, Phara.

455
00:54:40,531 --> 00:54:42,074
Phara, stop!

456
00:55:13,939 --> 00:55:15,607
- Take aim!
- Freestone, wait!

457
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:22,447
She's gone. Drop it.

458
00:55:43,468 --> 00:55:44,970
Well, this is encouraging.

459
00:55:45,554 --> 00:55:48,807
Anacreons, Thespins, and Termini.

460
00:55:50,017 --> 00:55:52,769
Seeing you all gathered here
gives me hope...

461
00:55:55,939 --> 00:55:58,025
we might actually pull this off.

461
00:55:59,305 --> 00:56:59,731
