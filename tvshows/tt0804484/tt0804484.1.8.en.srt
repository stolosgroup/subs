2
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:27,814
Ilex!

3
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,407
After they were gone,
there were no children left.

4
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:39,785
Only warriors.

5
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:45,374
I pushed this scarred body of mine till
I was named the Grand Huntress of War.

6
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:51,672
I outlived my life's expectancy
three times over.

7
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:56,009
The Weald Gods wouldn't let me die
till I got my revenge.

8
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,471
And when I was ready...

9
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:03,058
they sent me a second gift.

10
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:04,560
The Invictus?

11
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:06,895
It blinked into orbit like a prayer.

12
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,439
And I knew then,

13
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:13,151
the gods did not just approve of
my mission to destroy the Empire,

14
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:14,903
they engineered it.

15
00:03:14,987 --> 00:03:16,905
You saw what happened to your people.

16
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:23,912
For the sins of a few,
the Empire wiped out half your world.

17
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:28,500
If you strike at Trantor,
the entire Outer Reach will suffer.

18
00:03:28,584 --> 00:03:30,961
You simply have no concept of revenge,
do you?

19
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:34,423
I don't care about mankind.

20
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:40,220
This ship is going to be my voice.

21
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:44,308
You will help me navigate its next jump.

22
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:48,270
And if you don't,

23
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,732
my hunters will kill every man,

24
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:57,571
woman and child left on Terminus,

25
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,156
starting with your mother.

26
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:06,288
You already sacrificed your father.

27
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:09,458
You wouldn't sacrifice her as well.

28
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:13,545
The trade-off is simple, Warden.

29
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:18,091
Destroy Trantor...

30
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:23,347
and maybe, just maybe,

31
00:04:24,348 --> 00:04:27,809
your precious Foundation survives
what comes after.

32
00:04:30,646 --> 00:04:33,649
Isn't it remarkable
what a person will do for a little time?

33
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,846
How long have you been able to do this?

34
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,057
As long as I can remember.

35
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:11,770
Most of the time it's just a feeling.

36
00:05:12,855 --> 00:05:14,231
Like with this, but...

37
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:18,277
other times it comes in dreams.

38
00:05:20,571 --> 00:05:22,447
I used to dream about a wave.

39
00:05:23,866 --> 00:05:25,117
A wave so big...

40
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:30,956
all I could do was hold my breath
and let it take me.

41
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:37,880
I knew it would crush my home,
my family, my whole world.

42
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:43,010
I could never get rid of that dream, Hari.

43
00:05:44,887 --> 00:05:46,221
It haunted me.

44
00:05:46,305 --> 00:05:49,308
I needed to know that
it wasn't going to happen in real life,

45
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:52,311
so I taught myself math.

46
00:05:52,394 --> 00:05:56,315
I calculated every probability
and physical force I could think of,

47
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:58,066
desperate to see a way around it.

48
00:06:01,904 --> 00:06:03,405
But I couldn't find one.

49
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:07,743
That dream drove you to mathematics,

50
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:11,038
which only proved it wasn't
a dream at all, but a premonition.

51
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:13,415
I wouldn't be surprised to learn

52
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:16,376
that you have some sort of
intuitive processing ability

53
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,920
that puts you ahead of the math.

54
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,130
It would explain Abraxas.

55
00:06:21,757 --> 00:06:25,093
I solved Abraxas
because I worked my ass off.

56
00:06:25,177 --> 00:06:27,971
Yes, I'm saying you're extraordinary.

57
00:06:34,353 --> 00:06:35,812
It's getting hotter.

58
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:38,065
Friction as we enter the debris field.

59
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:40,692
The ship's radiators
will bleed off the heat.

60
00:06:40,776 --> 00:06:44,655
Initiating heat transfer system.
Stabilizing.

61
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:46,907
Why are you going to Helicon, Hari?

62
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,909
What were you and Raych planning?

63
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,953
I've already told you.

64
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:52,876
No, I made a supposition
which you didn't deny.

65
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:53,956
Because you were right.

66
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:56,948
Are you really going to continue
keeping me in the dark?

67
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,503
One could argue
I should've done so from the beginning.

68
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:01,213
What's that supposed to mean?

69
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:02,840
If we're not careful,

70
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:07,553
this prescience of yours has the potential
to skew psychohistory completely.

71
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:09,555
Look what happened to you and Raych.

72
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:11,056
You're here, he's not.

73
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:15,161
That didn't come out right.
Let me take that back.

74
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:17,145
What I'm trying to say

75
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:21,441
is that mankind's survival
is predicated on us reaching Helicon.

76
00:07:21,525 --> 00:07:24,528
I thought our survival
depended on the Foundation.

77
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:26,321
It is, to an extent.

78
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:33,787
But only if its sister organization is
established as well.

79
00:07:33,871 --> 00:07:35,914
So it is a second Foundation.

80
00:07:35,998 --> 00:07:40,294
Here, at Star's End. On Helicon.

81
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:49,738
This is Hugo Crast...

82
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,075
This is Cian un Edan,

83
00:08:54,493 --> 00:08:56,620
former citizen of Thespis,

84
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:01,708
sending an SOS to the Thespin Republic.

85
00:09:02,668 --> 00:09:06,880
Anacreon activity to report at outpost 59.

86
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:11,093
Does anyone read me?

87
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:14,513
Does anyone read me?

88
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:19,268
Does anyone read me?

89
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:03,645
The Spiral is designed to push
the body to the limits of its endurance.

90
00:10:03,729 --> 00:10:09,234
A trek of over 170 kilometers
with no food, no water and no rest.

91
00:10:09,318 --> 00:10:11,028
Vital signs are optimal.

92
00:10:13,572 --> 00:10:17,159
And, of course, you must leave
any inorganic devices behind.

93
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:19,036
Your protective aura...

94
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:32,591
and your imperial nanobots.

95
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:40,390
For the first time in your life,
you will be subject to injury,

96
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:43,060
- exhaustion...
- I understand.

97
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:44,937
In the event that a pilgrim falters,

98
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,564
he may receive help
from another person on the path.

99
00:10:47,648 --> 00:10:50,234
That is,
if he has only fallen to one knee.

100
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:54,821
If both knees should drop,
this is a signal of submission.

101
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:59,451
The pilgrim must either find
the strength to crawl away from the path,

102
00:10:59,535 --> 00:11:01,578
or he must yield to death.

103
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:07,251
Less than half of those who start
will reach the center of the Spiral.

104
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:10,754
There, they will enter a sacred cave,
the Mother's Womb.

105
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:13,173
There is water inside the Womb.

106
00:11:13,757 --> 00:11:16,677
The salt around the pool has
a particular ionic charge

107
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:20,472
which elicits a singular reaction
in anyone who touches it.

108
00:11:20,556 --> 00:11:26,144
After you immerse yourself in the pool,
if the Mother is willing,

109
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,438
you will be graced with a vision.

110
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:31,275
If you're successful and you return,

111
00:11:31,942 --> 00:11:34,862
a panel of Zephyrs will interpret
what you have seen.

112
00:11:34,945 --> 00:11:36,446
What have other pilgrims seen?

113
00:11:36,947 --> 00:11:39,700
Every vision is unique
and deeply personal.

114
00:11:40,284 --> 00:11:42,995
I'm surprised they're not
all just hallucinating about food.

115
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:45,831
Nanobot removal complete.

116
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:51,336
This gambit will put you at serious risk,
Empire.

117
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,548
In addition
to unprecedented physical danger,

118
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:56,008
if...

119
00:11:56,091 --> 00:11:58,093
if you're unable to make it to the end,

120
00:11:58,177 --> 00:12:00,345
that will only embolden your critics.

121
00:12:00,888 --> 00:12:02,306
I will make it to the end.

122
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:08,270
Give me your salt bracelet.

123
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:27,998
I'm taking this.

124
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:32,294
It'll be as though
you're right there with me.

125
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:35,297
As you always have been.

126
00:13:33,939 --> 00:13:36,441
In faith. Take it slow.

127
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:40,153
These middle rings can be deceptive.

128
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:43,031
Make us think
we're further along than we are.

129
00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:46,451
Just be sure you've got
some fuel left in the tank.

130
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:48,203
Done this before?

131
00:13:48,912 --> 00:13:52,457
No, no. But I've talked
to a number of people who have.

132
00:13:57,212 --> 00:13:59,006
Any other useful tips to impart?

133
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:02,176
There's no way to make it easy.

134
00:14:02,843 --> 00:14:04,219
That's kind of the point.

135
00:14:05,095 --> 00:14:06,513
Just pace yourself.

136
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:09,224
One foot in front of the other.

137
00:14:09,933 --> 00:14:11,727
The Triple Goddess will guide you.

138
00:14:13,937 --> 00:14:16,857
Did these people talk about their visions?

139
00:14:21,445 --> 00:14:24,114
One pilgrim did tell me

140
00:14:24,198 --> 00:14:29,536
how the salt around the pool started
to swirl and shift right before her eyes.

141
00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:32,289
She didn't say what happened next,

142
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:35,292
but she said it was
the most beautiful thing she'd ever seen.

143
00:14:40,923 --> 00:14:44,092
- Where are you from?
- Baltaros. You?

144
00:14:44,176 --> 00:14:47,513
- Nishaya.
- The manufacturing planet.

145
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,850
Whatever's too toxic to make
right on Trantor, that's what we do.

146
00:14:52,935 --> 00:14:54,436
Speciality textiles.

147
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:58,357
Certain kinds of ceramic glazes
the Empire favors.

148
00:14:59,983 --> 00:15:01,193
Nishaya's the perfect place,

149
00:15:01,276 --> 00:15:04,029
because our atmosphere is
all this thick white fog,

150
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:08,200
and, well,
the pollution just sort of blends.

151
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:11,245
That fog.

152
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:12,871
My mother used to say

153
00:15:12,955 --> 00:15:15,795
that by the time she finally got
her first good look at my dad's face...

154
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:18,168
they'd already had three kids together.

155
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:22,631
Did you work in one of these factories?

156
00:15:22,714 --> 00:15:24,800
No. I was a loader.

157
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:27,219
Loading boxes onto jumpships.

158
00:15:29,972 --> 00:15:32,099
Magnificent machines, aren't they?

159
00:15:32,182 --> 00:15:33,183
Oh, sure.

160
00:15:33,809 --> 00:15:36,353
Of course, I'd never actually been
on one till I came here.

161
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:39,231
Used all my savings to book my passage.

162
00:15:41,024 --> 00:15:44,194
From Baltaros?
You must have taken one as well.

163
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:45,279
Yes.

164
00:15:47,573 --> 00:15:49,032
Also my first time.

165
00:15:51,076 --> 00:15:53,829
I used to be jealous of people
who got to travel all the time,

166
00:15:53,912 --> 00:15:56,039
jumping from
one end of the galaxy to the next.

167
00:15:56,623 --> 00:16:01,461
But this... this is the only journey
I ever really needed to make.

168
00:16:03,505 --> 00:16:04,840
I hope you feel the same.

169
00:16:07,384 --> 00:16:08,635
A second Foundation?

170
00:16:08,719 --> 00:16:11,638
Terminus was established
via Imperial charter

171
00:16:11,722 --> 00:16:14,766
and was, in part, designed to draw fire.

172
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:19,354
But the Second Foundation
and its location must be kept secret,

173
00:16:20,898 --> 00:16:22,566
even from the first Foundation.

174
00:16:23,317 --> 00:16:25,027
Why? What's its purpose?

175
00:16:28,113 --> 00:16:31,325
If you're not willing to trust me,
then I am not going to Helicon.

176
00:16:32,284 --> 00:16:33,702
Don't be ridiculous, Gaal.

177
00:16:34,328 --> 00:16:36,997
I have resources on Helicon. Allies.

178
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,958
Now that we know the nature
of your abilities, we could study them.

179
00:16:40,042 --> 00:16:41,418
Use them to our advantage.

180
00:16:41,502 --> 00:16:44,129
I am done being used.

181
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,841
I want off. Now.

182
00:16:47,925 --> 00:16:51,929
Either you tell me,
or I will leave the same way I came.

183
00:16:57,059 --> 00:16:58,185
Where will you go?

184
00:16:58,268 --> 00:17:00,354
Terminus will take decades.

185
00:17:00,437 --> 00:17:02,689
Trantor? You'll be banished by the Empire.

186
00:17:02,773 --> 00:17:05,442
There are more worlds than that.
My mother taught me their names.

187
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,949
You told me my instincts are important.

188
00:17:12,491 --> 00:17:14,201
Well, they're telling me.

189
00:17:14,284 --> 00:17:16,328
Open the goddamn door.

190
00:17:16,411 --> 00:17:20,374
- You're not thinking clearly.
- Don't tell me what I think.

191
00:17:20,457 --> 00:17:21,959
Open it.

192
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:28,298
Open it!

193
00:17:29,633 --> 00:17:30,676
Open!

194
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:35,055
Open the door!

195
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,167
Don't give up yet, son.
We're getting close.

196
00:18:56,136 --> 00:18:57,137
Yes.

197
00:19:05,938 --> 00:19:10,025
Thirty...
No, 29 minutes till the next jump.

198
00:19:15,405 --> 00:19:16,657
Her plan...

199
00:19:18,075 --> 00:19:19,535
Even if you succeed,

200
00:19:21,411 --> 00:19:23,747
the Empire will slaughter
the rest of your people.

201
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:26,500
And it won't be a half measure this time.

202
00:19:28,544 --> 00:19:29,711
They'll kill everyone.

203
00:19:31,338 --> 00:19:33,257
And in the chaos that follows...

204
00:19:35,425 --> 00:19:36,718
they'll all be forgotten.

205
00:19:38,887 --> 00:19:42,558
I know Phara sees herself as a hand
reaching out of Anacreon's grave...

206
00:19:44,893 --> 00:19:47,479
but Anacreon children are
still being born today.

207
00:19:52,401 --> 00:19:54,001
You have a child of your own, don't you?

208
00:19:56,154 --> 00:19:57,281
A little girl.

209
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,952
- It feels like a little girl.
- How are you doing this?

210
00:20:02,035 --> 00:20:04,454
Phara didn't tell you?
People are open books to me.

211
00:20:06,665 --> 00:20:09,251
All I read in her was darkness.

212
00:20:09,334 --> 00:20:11,545
But I read doubt inside you.

213
00:20:13,505 --> 00:20:15,674
There's still a path forward for Anacreon.

214
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,470
Isn't that a better way
to pay back all the dead?

215
00:20:19,678 --> 00:20:22,055
- Take cover!
- Jacenta?

216
00:20:26,602 --> 00:20:27,603
Damn this ship.

217
00:20:28,729 --> 00:20:29,938
Rowan.

218
00:20:44,912 --> 00:20:45,913
This was a mutiny.

219
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:50,083
The officers must have positioned
the gun to guard the bridge.

220
00:20:57,633 --> 00:20:59,134
You.

221
00:20:59,218 --> 00:21:01,018
You're gonna draw its fire
while I disable it.

222
00:21:01,053 --> 00:21:02,054
What if you miss?

223
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:03,722
Then you'll die.

224
00:21:24,743 --> 00:21:25,911
Time's running out, Warden.

225
00:22:07,703 --> 00:22:11,331
- Lucky shot.
- You do luck, I do skill.

226
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,166
Another barrier.

227
00:22:15,586 --> 00:22:16,753
You know the drill.

228
00:22:43,822 --> 00:22:45,490
- Get down!
- Lewis!

229
00:22:55,959 --> 00:22:57,419
Come on.

230
00:22:57,503 --> 00:22:59,421
Won't take them long
to get through those doors.

231
00:23:08,388 --> 00:23:09,640
Override the door.

232
00:23:15,896 --> 00:23:17,314
We're running out of time!

233
00:23:47,302 --> 00:23:48,428
Captain killed herself.

234
00:23:50,472 --> 00:23:51,682
"Exo."

235
00:23:52,808 --> 00:23:55,727
Like, executive officer?

236
00:23:55,811 --> 00:23:58,522
Was she betrayed by someone
in her command?

237
00:23:58,605 --> 00:24:01,024
Exo also means "from outside."

238
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,151
Outside the galaxy?

239
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:07,281
You think they encountered something
out there?

240
00:24:16,123 --> 00:24:17,583
Individual work pods.

241
00:24:20,169 --> 00:24:21,503
One of these controls navigation.

242
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:27,050
If we can find it, we have a shot
at redirecting the next jump.

243
00:24:27,134 --> 00:24:28,135
Weapons?

244
00:24:28,969 --> 00:24:30,179
Not a weapon.

245
00:24:31,096 --> 00:24:32,389
Propulsion.

246
00:24:33,182 --> 00:24:35,309
They must have jumped
too far away to resupply.

247
00:24:36,852 --> 00:24:39,771
Just started jumping farther out
and farther out.

248
00:24:39,855 --> 00:24:43,317
Warning.
Trans-spatial event in 20 minutes.

249
00:24:44,526 --> 00:24:46,904
Initiate transit protocols.

250
00:24:46,987 --> 00:24:47,988
Now I get it.

251
00:24:48,071 --> 00:24:49,990
What, the lights are what?
Transit protocols?

252
00:24:50,073 --> 00:24:51,825
This ship doesn't have any Spacers.

253
00:24:51,909 --> 00:24:55,913
Without them, the crew members must have
had to sedate themselves before the jump.

254
00:24:56,413 --> 00:24:59,374
The lights told them
how long they had to reach a jump cradle.

255
00:24:59,458 --> 00:25:00,498
We're running out of time.

256
00:25:01,543 --> 00:25:02,544
Over there.

257
00:25:10,969 --> 00:25:13,680
This is it. The navigation cradle.

258
00:25:14,681 --> 00:25:16,099
Before the Empire had Spacers,

259
00:25:16,183 --> 00:25:19,186
these older ships needed something
with massive processing power

260
00:25:19,269 --> 00:25:20,562
to navigate their jumps.

261
00:25:20,646 --> 00:25:24,191
See, folding space is
as much intuition as it is science.

262
00:25:25,651 --> 00:25:27,069
It's like making a wish.

263
00:25:27,152 --> 00:25:31,073
A cognitive leap that only
a living brain can perform.

264
00:25:31,865 --> 00:25:33,116
The difference is,

265
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,786
Spacers were genetically engineered
to withstand the strain,

266
00:25:35,869 --> 00:25:39,790
but these unaugmented humans,
they didn't have that advantage.

267
00:25:42,209 --> 00:25:43,377
In order to survive...

268
00:25:46,421 --> 00:25:51,260
they had to be hardwired
directly into the ships.

269
00:25:54,096 --> 00:25:56,723
He was shot.
The ship was searching for him.

270
00:25:58,934 --> 00:26:00,477
Unable to navigate on its own.

271
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,404
Could someone jack in without the surgery?

272
00:26:13,532 --> 00:26:14,825
If the AI's intuitive,

273
00:26:16,368 --> 00:26:18,453
wouldn't the interface seek out
the right neurons?

274
00:26:18,537 --> 00:26:22,374
Oh, yes. Maybe.
But they wouldn't survive for long.

275
00:26:24,626 --> 00:26:26,044
Long enough to control the jump?

276
00:26:29,923 --> 00:26:31,592
To make sure the Foundation survives?

277
00:26:31,675 --> 00:26:33,594
A single jump into empty space?

278
00:26:36,638 --> 00:26:38,974
Maybe, but...

279
00:26:39,057 --> 00:26:40,559
it would be a death sentence.

280
00:26:42,811 --> 00:26:44,897
Well, if one of us
is gonna sacrifice ourselves,

281
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:46,398
it might as well be the outlier.

282
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,150
Help me figure out how.

283
00:26:51,612 --> 00:26:53,113
But not to empty space.

284
00:26:55,866 --> 00:26:57,784
I'm gonna take this ship home to Terminus.

285
00:27:40,369 --> 00:27:42,913
This one wants to speak to you,
Lieutenant.

286
00:27:45,582 --> 00:27:48,293
- Lieutenant Freestone, we have a problem.
- That thing out there?

287
00:27:48,377 --> 00:27:50,337
We call it the Vault.
We don't know what it is,

288
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:53,024
just that it's surrounded
by a signal field that makes people sick.

289
00:27:53,048 --> 00:27:55,175
You start seeing double
and eventually go unconscious.

290
00:27:55,801 --> 00:27:59,012
Your Huntress experienced its effects.

291
00:27:59,096 --> 00:28:01,014
That's how my daughter
was able to capture her.

292
00:28:01,098 --> 00:28:02,492
We don't know the long-term effect,

293
00:28:02,516 --> 00:28:05,644
but the field surrounding it
is getting larger.

294
00:28:05,727 --> 00:28:06,937
We have to evacuate.

295
00:28:08,564 --> 00:28:09,773
This isn't a trick.

296
00:28:11,024 --> 00:28:13,610
The null field doesn't give a damn
what planet you're from.

297
00:28:13,694 --> 00:28:16,405
If we don't act,
it's going to overtake us all.

298
00:28:16,989 --> 00:28:18,740
You have to let the fence down.

299
00:28:49,521 --> 00:28:51,106
The Mother calls to me.

300
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:54,651
- No. You still have strength.
- No.

301
00:29:07,873 --> 00:29:11,460
Let me at least help you off the path,
and they can tend to you.

302
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:23,222
You can't just die here.

303
00:29:24,139 --> 00:29:26,266
How could I choose to die anywhere else?

304
00:29:27,684 --> 00:29:29,102
A peaceful transition.

305
00:29:30,312 --> 00:29:32,397
That is the Mother's greatest gift...

306
00:29:34,274 --> 00:29:35,567
into a holier life.

307
00:29:36,527 --> 00:29:38,570
What if there is no other life?

308
00:29:39,571 --> 00:29:43,450
What if this is just the end?

309
00:29:53,669 --> 00:29:55,170
Maybe we'll meet again.

310
00:29:57,297 --> 00:29:59,299
You can tell me what you saw.

311
00:33:17,873 --> 00:33:24,755
You stand before representatives
of the Mother, the Maiden and the Crone.

312
00:33:25,923 --> 00:33:29,468
All who walk the Spiral are beloved to us.

313
00:33:30,135 --> 00:33:34,973
Tell us,
what did you experience inside the Womb?

314
00:33:36,767 --> 00:33:38,435
As I stood there...

315
00:33:41,146 --> 00:33:42,814
the salt began to move.

316
00:33:44,525 --> 00:33:46,818
And it began to swirl.

317
00:33:46,902 --> 00:33:50,864
Slowly at first, then faster.

318
00:33:53,033 --> 00:33:55,244
It lifted from the floor of the cave.

319
00:33:59,498 --> 00:34:02,167
It took the form of a stem...

320
00:34:05,212 --> 00:34:07,130
with three large petals.

321
00:34:11,176 --> 00:34:13,469
I worried that I was imagining it.

322
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:16,889
But it was real.

323
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:31,029
Are you familiar with mythology
of the birthroot flower?

324
00:34:34,908 --> 00:34:36,243
No.

325
00:34:38,786 --> 00:34:42,708
After Dol collided into Surah
and created the triple moons,

326
00:34:42,791 --> 00:34:45,252
the maiden was covered
in a blanket of birthroots.

327
00:34:45,335 --> 00:34:50,257
This was a sign from the Triple Goddess
that our world could sustain life.

328
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:53,802
Over the centuries,
the flowers gradually died off.

329
00:34:53,886 --> 00:34:57,806
We have not seen them here
for thousands of years.

330
00:34:57,890 --> 00:34:59,391
What does it mean?

331
00:34:59,474 --> 00:35:04,313
By their nature, three-petaled flowers
germinate from monocot seedlings.

332
00:35:04,396 --> 00:35:09,318
In other words,
three elements created out of one.

333
00:35:09,401 --> 00:35:11,320
Just like my brothers and I.

334
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:13,906
And the Triple Goddess as well.

335
00:35:13,989 --> 00:35:16,742
This is a holy vision, Empire.

336
00:35:17,993 --> 00:35:20,996
In fact, your very presence here is holy,

337
00:35:21,538 --> 00:35:25,042
a journey none
of your predecessors ever dared to make.

338
00:35:25,584 --> 00:35:30,005
Yours is clearly not
a soul mired in stagnation.

339
00:35:32,424 --> 00:35:37,137
Anyone who says that it is
would be guilty of sin themselves,

340
00:35:37,221 --> 00:35:43,519
of attempting to bar a seeking soul
from the path of enlightenment.

341
00:35:43,602 --> 00:35:48,315
From this day forth,
no other zephyr will stand in your way.

342
00:36:22,266 --> 00:36:23,767
You're wasting your strength.

343
00:36:25,394 --> 00:36:28,856
Better you rest until we're through the
debris field than risk heat exhaustion.

344
00:36:32,359 --> 00:36:33,944
What's the current temperature?

345
00:36:34,444 --> 00:36:37,406
38 degrees. Should peak around 41.

346
00:36:39,241 --> 00:36:40,659
And if it isn't the peak?

347
00:36:46,123 --> 00:36:47,207
What are you up to?

348
00:36:48,667 --> 00:36:51,712
Shut up. Just shut up.

349
00:36:52,671 --> 00:36:53,672
Gaal.

350
00:36:53,755 --> 00:36:55,507
Reaching critical temperature.

351
00:36:55,591 --> 00:36:58,010
Initializing heat transfer system.

352
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:00,721
- Gaal.
- Stabilizing.

353
00:37:00,804 --> 00:37:02,514
No more half-truths.

354
00:37:03,015 --> 00:37:05,976
Tell me everything,
or I'm ending the journey now.

355
00:37:06,059 --> 00:37:07,227
I mean it, Hari.

356
00:37:07,311 --> 00:37:09,855
If I do,
I risk destroying the Second Foundation

357
00:37:09,938 --> 00:37:11,356
before it's even been created.

358
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,026
- Tell me!
- You have no idea what you're...

359
00:37:14,109 --> 00:37:17,946
- Stop! Stop! Stop!
- I don't care anymore!

360
00:37:32,419 --> 00:37:33,629
What have you done?

361
00:37:36,131 --> 00:37:37,633
Without the heat transfer system,

362
00:37:37,716 --> 00:37:41,178
I'll be boiled alive
long before you reach Helicon.

363
00:37:42,012 --> 00:37:44,515
They say information can't be destroyed.

364
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,266
So maybe you'll survive.

365
00:37:48,268 --> 00:37:49,728
But I certainly won't.

366
00:37:59,905 --> 00:38:01,573
What's it gonna be, Hari?

367
00:38:02,991 --> 00:38:07,496
Either watch me burn to death
or let me go free.

368
00:38:15,254 --> 00:38:19,299
You realize I could just program
the cryopod to go where I want it to go?

369
00:38:19,383 --> 00:38:22,928
You don't need me, Hari. You never did.

370
00:38:23,011 --> 00:38:24,012
Not true.

371
00:38:24,096 --> 00:38:25,264
It is.

372
00:38:26,306 --> 00:38:29,893
My story was supposed to end on Terminus.
You said it yourself.

373
00:38:30,394 --> 00:38:34,064
You and Raych always intended
on leaving me behind so...

374
00:38:36,149 --> 00:38:37,276
Just let me go.

375
00:38:39,403 --> 00:38:40,404
Please.

376
00:39:07,431 --> 00:39:08,682
Bye, Hari.

377
00:39:09,933 --> 00:39:11,143
Goodbye, Gaal.

378
00:39:52,059 --> 00:39:53,727
Awaiting destination.

379
00:39:56,688 --> 00:39:59,316
Calculate journey to the Blue Drift.

380
00:39:59,399 --> 00:40:00,651
To Synnax.

381
00:40:02,069 --> 00:40:05,906
Duration, 138 imperial standard years.

382
00:40:12,621 --> 00:40:14,122
Confirm destination.

383
00:40:21,129 --> 00:40:25,259
86,982,041.

384
00:40:27,094 --> 00:40:31,723
86,982,043.

385
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:38,188
86,982,061...

386
00:41:26,904 --> 00:41:28,071
Zephyr Halima.

387
00:41:31,825 --> 00:41:35,954
Thank you for inspiring me to take
this journey of transformation.

388
00:41:38,373 --> 00:41:40,375
If I hadn't attended your eulogy,

389
00:41:41,627 --> 00:41:46,590
I never would have summoned
the courage to attempt the Spiral.

390
00:41:57,935 --> 00:42:01,104
Triple blessings to you, Empire.

391
00:42:03,524 --> 00:42:04,691
And to you.

392
00:42:39,351 --> 00:42:41,979
Please, come in.

393
00:42:43,856 --> 00:42:45,148
All are welcome.

394
00:42:47,401 --> 00:42:49,194
I wanted to express my condolences.

395
00:42:50,237 --> 00:42:52,531
You would have made a compelling proxima.

396
00:42:52,614 --> 00:42:53,782
Yes.

397
00:42:55,242 --> 00:42:57,703
I think that's what Cleon was afraid of.

398
00:42:59,663 --> 00:43:02,291
In any case, he got what he wanted.

399
00:43:04,751 --> 00:43:11,300
Zephyr Gilat will be named,
and, well, I'll return to my home planet.

400
00:43:17,139 --> 00:43:18,849
Are you not happy with the outcome?

401
00:43:20,434 --> 00:43:24,021
I just assumed you coached
the Emperor's performance.

402
00:43:24,104 --> 00:43:26,690
No, I did not.

403
00:43:27,274 --> 00:43:31,653
And I assure you,
my happiness is of no importance.

404
00:43:32,487 --> 00:43:33,530
I disagree.

405
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:43,040
Look, I know people use reincarnation
as an excuse to ignore their instincts,

406
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:46,502
to throw every opportunity
for happiness away.

407
00:43:46,585 --> 00:43:51,882
But if you do that,
how can you ever really grow?

408
00:43:51,965 --> 00:43:53,425
This is not about my growth.

409
00:43:53,509 --> 00:43:58,222
If you don't support him anymore,
you can find another path.

410
00:43:58,305 --> 00:43:59,431
That's not possible.

411
00:43:59,515 --> 00:44:01,183
Of course it is. You're not a prisoner.

412
00:44:01,266 --> 00:44:03,026
You don't understand.
I do not have a choice.

413
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:05,896
Everyone has a choice.
Even when it feels like they do not.

414
00:44:05,979 --> 00:44:09,441
I know how it sounds,
but I swear it on the Maiden. I do not.

415
00:44:09,525 --> 00:44:10,692
How can that be?

416
00:44:18,075 --> 00:44:21,245
You once said you walked the Great Spiral.

417
00:44:22,621 --> 00:44:23,622
When was that?

418
00:44:28,752 --> 00:44:30,504
11,000 years ago.

419
00:44:37,052 --> 00:44:39,137
So it's true?

420
00:44:40,764 --> 00:44:46,061
I heard the rumors that Cleon had
the last intelligent robot in the galaxy.

421
00:44:48,063 --> 00:44:50,440
The things you must have seen...

422
00:44:50,524 --> 00:44:53,944
And now you have to stand by that man
and do whatever he...

423
00:45:02,828 --> 00:45:04,204
He sent you here.

424
00:45:10,169 --> 00:45:14,006
I'm not gonna leave this room alive, am I?

425
00:45:15,841 --> 00:45:18,177
That's the only reason
you told me the truth.

426
00:45:26,185 --> 00:45:31,523
Like Empire,
I do not have individuated sentience.

427
00:45:33,442 --> 00:45:36,361
So I too must not be
in the possession of a soul.

428
00:45:37,821 --> 00:45:42,034
If I were,
then perhaps I could disobey his commands.

429
00:45:46,288 --> 00:45:48,457
Are you sure you do not have one?

430
00:45:50,209 --> 00:45:55,005
If I allow you to run from me now,
I couldn't stop myself.

431
00:45:56,048 --> 00:45:59,676
I would still hunt you down.
I would rip you to pieces.

432
00:46:08,852 --> 00:46:10,062
I'm sorry.

433
00:46:13,774 --> 00:46:18,570
I see genuine compassion in your heart.

434
00:46:19,154 --> 00:46:24,284
True remorse. And I can't explain it,

435
00:46:25,452 --> 00:46:28,497
but I know that you have a soul.

436
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:32,793
But the one who forces you to do this,

437
00:46:33,627 --> 00:46:37,464
who so cruelly tests your faith
and your loyalty,

438
00:46:38,674 --> 00:46:40,342
he is a soulless man.

439
00:46:45,097 --> 00:46:46,473
I forgive you, Demerzel.

440
00:46:48,725 --> 00:46:51,645
Hey, remember your text.

441
00:46:54,481 --> 00:46:57,276
My end does not come now.

442
00:46:58,318 --> 00:46:59,987
I will be reborn.

443
00:47:00,571 --> 00:47:04,575
You were sent to me
not from Cleon but from the Mother.

444
00:47:06,368 --> 00:47:07,828
Do what you must.

445
00:47:10,539 --> 00:47:11,623
As Her will.

446
00:47:12,249 --> 00:47:13,584
As Her will.

447
00:47:22,551 --> 00:47:26,305
Now, how will it happen?

448
00:47:26,388 --> 00:47:28,182
It has already been done.

449
00:47:30,726 --> 00:47:33,645
A poison was secreted
when our skin touched.

450
00:47:34,354 --> 00:47:35,606
You will feel no pain.

451
00:47:58,754 --> 00:48:02,299
Warning.
Trans-spatial event in five minutes.

452
00:48:02,382 --> 00:48:03,675
Prepare for transition.

453
00:48:03,759 --> 00:48:05,260
The ship is preparing to jump!

454
00:48:05,886 --> 00:48:08,889
I can't overwrite
the locking mechanism.

455
00:48:08,972 --> 00:48:10,557
Then get me through some other way.

456
00:48:28,909 --> 00:48:30,202
All right, let's plug me in.

457
00:48:30,285 --> 00:48:32,412
Look, Salvor,
I'm not even sure this is possible.

458
00:48:32,496 --> 00:48:35,541
Jumping into a planet's orbit requires
absolute precision.

459
00:48:35,624 --> 00:48:36,792
Or luck.

460
00:48:37,835 --> 00:48:39,378
Remember who you're dealing with.

461
00:48:41,296 --> 00:48:44,591
It's probably like flipping a coin
over and over, right?

462
00:48:46,301 --> 00:48:48,470
Maybe like flipping it a thousand times.

463
00:48:53,517 --> 00:48:54,560
Let's start flipping.

464
00:48:54,643 --> 00:48:57,396
- You're telling me to kill you.
- Lewis, don't you see?

465
00:48:58,689 --> 00:49:00,232
This is what I was meant to do.

466
00:49:01,650 --> 00:49:04,862
Everything that happened,
it brought me here.

467
00:49:07,322 --> 00:49:09,074
Now this is our only chance.

468
00:49:09,157 --> 00:49:11,076
So I have to try.

469
00:49:11,827 --> 00:49:13,662
We have to try.

470
00:49:13,745 --> 00:49:15,998
And that is all there is in a crisis.

471
00:49:17,624 --> 00:49:18,625
Trying.

472
00:49:36,143 --> 00:49:38,395
If I die, give this to my mother,
would you?

473
00:49:43,233 --> 00:49:44,484
You're something, Salvor.

474
00:49:46,445 --> 00:49:47,988
I wish I'd seen it earlier.

475
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:49,948
Do it.

476
00:49:51,783 --> 00:49:52,826
Do it.

477
00:49:56,788 --> 00:49:57,873
Lewis?

478
00:50:04,004 --> 00:50:05,005
Kill her!

479
00:50:05,088 --> 00:50:07,549
You're gonna be okay, you hear me?
Just stay with me, Lewis.

480
00:50:08,133 --> 00:50:09,718
Kill the bitch!

481
00:50:09,801 --> 00:50:10,636
Come on.

482
00:50:10,719 --> 00:50:11,719
Flank her!

483
00:50:16,975 --> 00:50:18,936
Hostile craft detected.

484
00:50:19,019 --> 00:50:20,812
Automated defenses engaged.

485
00:50:23,649 --> 00:50:24,650
Thespin Lancers.

486
00:50:24,733 --> 00:50:26,026
You did it, Hugo.

487
00:50:26,109 --> 00:50:28,320
Thirty seconds before trans-spatial event.

488
00:50:28,403 --> 00:50:30,322
Proceed to cryopods immediately.

489
00:50:31,156 --> 00:50:33,492
Stand down, Anacreons.

490
00:50:33,575 --> 00:50:36,828
Surrender the ship
to us immediately or die.

491
00:50:37,746 --> 00:50:39,831
Get as many guns on them as you can!

492
00:50:47,548 --> 00:50:48,548
Fifteen...

493
00:50:49,132 --> 00:50:52,135
fourteen, thirteen...

494
00:50:56,557 --> 00:50:57,933
eleven...

495
00:50:58,809 --> 00:51:02,187
ten, nine...

496
00:51:03,063 --> 00:51:04,439
eight...

497
00:51:07,484 --> 00:51:09,695
six, five...

498
00:51:11,822 --> 00:51:13,115
four...

499
00:51:14,157 --> 00:51:16,702
three, two...

500
00:51:17,995 --> 00:51:19,413
one...

501
00:51:23,792 --> 00:51:24,793
We're jumping.

502
00:51:52,196 --> 00:51:53,197
Well?

503
00:51:53,989 --> 00:51:54,990
It is done.

504
00:51:55,908 --> 00:51:58,327
It will appear
as if she died of natural causes.

505
00:51:58,410 --> 00:52:01,538
Good. Last thing
we want to do is start a holy war.

506
00:52:06,210 --> 00:52:08,337
Do you have something you wish to say?

507
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:11,423
You'd defeated her. You'd won.

508
00:52:11,507 --> 00:52:15,844
Your lack of understanding
does not obligate me to explain.

509
00:52:15,928 --> 00:52:17,304
No, of course not.

510
00:52:17,387 --> 00:52:19,014
You are Empire.

511
00:52:20,224 --> 00:52:21,683
And you had a holy vision.

512
00:52:21,767 --> 00:52:23,393
That I did.

513
00:52:28,607 --> 00:52:32,277
I have an ancient birthroot flower
pressed and framed on my vanity.

514
00:52:32,861 --> 00:52:35,822
I acquired it
when I myself walked the Spiral.

515
00:52:35,906 --> 00:52:37,616
I brought it with me on this journey.

516
00:52:38,283 --> 00:52:39,493
Is that so?

517
00:52:40,327 --> 00:52:44,373
I just thought you might have seen it when
you came into my room the other night.

518
00:52:44,456 --> 00:52:46,959
No, not that I recall.

519
00:52:47,042 --> 00:52:48,961
Just a happy coincidence, I suppose.

520
00:52:49,044 --> 00:52:50,921
You seeing the same flower.

521
00:52:52,130 --> 00:52:56,301
In any event, I didn't mean to pry.
I know how personal these visions can be.

522
00:52:56,385 --> 00:52:59,638
Though it's many eons ago, what I saw...

523
00:53:01,223 --> 00:53:03,100
changed the way I look at everything.

524
00:53:04,226 --> 00:53:07,104
You had a vision? A robot?

525
00:53:07,187 --> 00:53:11,441
I did. And I am pleased
that you were graced with one as well.

526
00:53:13,277 --> 00:53:14,611
Seeing nothing...

527
00:53:17,447 --> 00:53:19,950
I would not wish that emptiness on anyone.

528
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:25,122
May your vision give you strength

529
00:53:25,205 --> 00:53:27,875
as we make our journey
back to Trantor, Empire.

530
00:53:28,458 --> 00:53:31,962
I will notify the Spacers
to prepare you for the jump.

531
00:54:44,117 --> 00:54:47,079
Seeing nothing...

532
00:54:48,163 --> 00:54:51,625
I would not wish that emptiness on anyone.

532
00:54:52,305 --> 00:55:52,710
