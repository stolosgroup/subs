2
00:00:34,326 --> 00:00:36,554
Hey, can I talk to you for a...

3
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:38,515
Oh...

4
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:40,169
- Hey.
- Hey.

5
00:00:42,251 --> 00:00:43,520
What's up?

6
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:47,649
Uh, can you go to Mia's
dad's wedding with me?

7
00:00:47,673 --> 00:00:49,660
Aw! That's sweet of you to ask.

8
00:00:49,684 --> 00:00:52,070
- Hard pass.
- What? Why?

9
00:00:52,094 --> 00:00:54,577
Let's see, all of your
friends are painfully boring,

10
00:00:54,601 --> 00:00:58,556
and I couldn't pick Mia's dad and
Veronica out of a line-up of old people.

11
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:02,814
Pilar, please. I feel really bad
for showing up solo last second.

12
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:08,711
Why don't you bring Rahim? He loves
all that cheesy romantic crap,

13
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:10,380
he's always trying to
start a conga line,

14
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:14,759
and he has fancy blazer
napkins for every suit he owns.

15
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:18,137
Do you not know the
term "pocket square"?

16
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:20,661
I'm just saying, you two
would have fun together.

17
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:25,360
I mean, there's like, it's
like zero pressure, but,

18
00:01:25,384 --> 00:01:26,896
w-would you wanna go?

19
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,776
Are you sure Benji'd
be cool with it?

20
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,985
Honestly, Benji kind of
lost his right to an opinion

21
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:34,195
when he bailed on
me last second.

22
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:37,259
And besides, we're friends. Why
wouldn't he be cool with it?

23
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:42,227
- Yeah. Okay. Yes.
- I would love to go with you.

24
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,085
All right. Cool. Felix is meeting
us here around three o'clock.

25
00:01:46,109 --> 00:01:47,856
- See you then.
- All right. See you then.

26
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:10,690
Well, I'm off to
show my new listing.

27
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:13,902
The house was the site of
a pretty grisly murder.

28
00:02:13,926 --> 00:02:16,571
I'm trying to distract
with my cleavage.

29
00:02:16,595 --> 00:02:18,781
I would totally buy a
murder house from you.

30
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:21,659
Aw! I'll see you at
my place tonight?

31
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:25,330
- Yeah.
- I'm making fried chicken, so have a light lunch.

32
00:02:25,354 --> 00:02:27,790
- And wear some loose pants.
- I'll be there.

33
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,501
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

34
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:36,157
Oh. Hi.

35
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:40,696
- Hi. I'm...
- Shelby. Right?

36
00:02:41,537 --> 00:02:43,515
Isa. Uh, what are
you doing here?

37
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:46,646
Sorry. I just... I need to talk
and you're not answering my texts.

38
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:49,938
Isn't he the absolute worst
with texting?

39
00:02:49,962 --> 00:02:51,689
Mm-hmm.

40
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:54,697
All right, well, I was
just heading out, so, um...

41
00:02:54,721 --> 00:02:56,694
It's nice to meet you, Isabel.

42
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:57,758
You, too.

43
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,580
- You want a donut, or...

44
00:03:05,604 --> 00:03:07,749
I'm sorry. I didn't
know she'd be here.

45
00:03:07,773 --> 00:03:11,292
I just... I'm
worried about Victor.

46
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:15,088
He's barely left his room
since his "break" with Benji.

47
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:18,383
Which I know was at
least partially my fault.

48
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:21,678
- I was pretty horrible to that boy.
- Well...

49
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:24,372
It's never too late
to be un-horrible.

50
00:03:24,997 --> 00:03:27,037
Yeah. Maybe you're right.

51
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,896
But it's not just Benji.

52
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,940
When Victor saw
you with Shelby...

53
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:36,264
- Yeah, I know.
- I, I could tell it really got to him.

54
00:03:37,593 --> 00:03:40,449
Mando, we've been
separated for six months.

55
00:03:40,473 --> 00:03:42,600
And you're seeing
another woman. It's...

56
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:46,191
I believe we can
save our marriage.

57
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:49,435
I want to save our marriage.

58
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:53,084
But if you don't,

59
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:56,528
then it's time to start this
new chapter in our lives.

60
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:01,467
This living in between is just

61
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,845
it's too hard on the kids.

62
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:05,579
It's too hard on me.

63
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:10,536
It's time for you to
decide what you want to do.

64
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:15,959
I know. You're right.

65
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,215
Thanks for the donut.

66
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:49,390
Hi, sweetheart.

67
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:51,754
Hi, Mom.

68
00:04:53,085 --> 00:04:54,335
Hi.

69
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:57,666
- Welcome home.
- Oh...

70
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:00,884
- I missed you.
- I missed you.

71
00:05:01,677 --> 00:05:02,987
I swear to you,

72
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:05,698
this woman truly believed

73
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:08,247
that she was the lost sister
of the Queen of England.

74
00:05:08,271 --> 00:05:11,374
And when people would pass by
her, they would have to curtsy,

75
00:05:11,398 --> 00:05:13,122
or she would just lose it.

76
00:05:15,858 --> 00:05:17,627
It seems like you're
doing good, Mom.

77
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:18,962
I feel good.

78
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:24,050
I mean, not that there
weren't tough days, but

79
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:28,930
when it would get hard,
I would just...

80
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:31,481
Close my eyes, I would
take a deep breath,

81
00:05:31,505 --> 00:05:36,396
and I would think about all
the things that I would miss

82
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,130
if I didn't get
my shit together.

83
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:42,676
Like having brunch with you...

84
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:45,465
Seeing you graduate.

85
00:05:47,598 --> 00:05:49,058
Seeing you get married.

86
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:52,370
And that made it

87
00:05:52,394 --> 00:05:55,614
clear as day what
I needed to do.

88
00:05:56,523 --> 00:06:00,003
So I would drag
my ass out of bed,

89
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:02,607
I would take my new meds...

90
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:07,391
I would curse that place for not
allowing me to have Swedish Fish,

91
00:06:07,415 --> 00:06:09,888
because, like...

92
00:06:09,912 --> 00:06:11,752
And then I would go to therapy.

93
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:17,228
You know, Mom, I can
bail on the wedding.

94
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:19,564
No. No, you should go,

95
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:23,318
and I don't think that Lake would
take kindly to you standing her up.

96
00:06:26,178 --> 00:06:28,865
Yeah, um...

97
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:31,367
I was gonna tell you about that

98
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,708
once, uh, you got
back up on your feet.

99
00:06:33,732 --> 00:06:37,582
Um, Lake and I broke up.

100
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:40,710
Oh, Felix, I'm so sorry.

101
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,128
What happened?

102
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:44,402
She betrayed my trust.

103
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:48,885
I mean, she told her
mom about our situation.

104
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:51,659
I understand why
you feel betrayed.

105
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:57,644
But I want you to know that

106
00:06:57,668 --> 00:07:00,855
whatever happens between
you and Lake in the future,

107
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:03,589
I will forever be
grateful to her.

108
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:06,839
What do you mean?

109
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:12,347
She risked your relationship to make
sure that I got the help that I needed.

110
00:07:13,475 --> 00:07:17,645
And I think that that
makes her pretty special.

111
00:07:19,398 --> 00:07:23,528
Plus, that girl looks
great in a crop top.

112
00:07:24,236 --> 00:07:25,630
Yeah.

113
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:27,340
Okay, so which
one of these says,

114
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:30,426
"Lake Meriwether is single
and ready to mingle?"

115
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:35,348
Who am I kidding? It's the
jumpsuit. It's always the jumpsuit.

116
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:38,434
Look, I'm so glad that
you are ready to mingle,

117
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,687
but I only invited like
four people to this wedding,

118
00:07:40,711 --> 00:07:43,986
and they're either gay, my
boyfriend or your ex-boyfriend.

119
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:45,859
Morning, ladies.

120
00:07:45,883 --> 00:07:46,820
Good morning.

121
00:07:46,844 --> 00:07:49,779
Dad! Isn't the groom not
supposed to see the bride

122
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:51,700
- before the wedding?
- Ah, well...

123
00:07:51,724 --> 00:07:54,242
I think when the bride
is hugely pregnant,

124
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:56,286
all the traditional rules
kind of go out the window.

125
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,520
Excuse me, Mr. Brooks?
- Oh. Excuse me, ladies.

126
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:00,811
Hi! HAROLD: Hey.

127
00:08:02,858 --> 00:08:04,148
Uh...

128
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:07,714
This is for you.

129
00:08:07,738 --> 00:08:09,198
Mia!

130
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:14,304
Oh, it's beautiful!

131
00:08:14,328 --> 00:08:17,685
- Yeah, it was my grandmother's.
- And I know she would have loved you.

132
00:08:17,709 --> 00:08:20,666
Except for you being
knocked up. And white.

133
00:08:21,585 --> 00:08:24,105
Yeah, actually, she
probably would've hated you.

134
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:26,316
But
I... I like you,

135
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:29,027
and I, I thought it could
be your something old.

136
00:08:29,051 --> 00:08:31,154
I love it.

137
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:33,490
I'm really glad we're
gonna be a family.

138
00:08:33,514 --> 00:08:35,104
- Oh.

139
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:40,811
Um...

140
00:08:42,481 --> 00:08:44,731
I'm sorry. Harold...

141
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,420
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry, we can't

142
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:49,881
I know. I know.

143
00:08:49,905 --> 00:08:51,735
Guys, what's going on?

144
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,304
Hey, uh, sweetheart,
listen, um...

145
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:02,463
I'm gonna go ahead and
take the job at Stanford.

146
00:09:03,836 --> 00:09:06,189
What? I thought
you turned it down.

147
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:08,860
I know, but you
know what, sweetheart?

148
00:09:08,884 --> 00:09:11,722
I realized it's too
big of an opportunity.

149
00:09:13,095 --> 00:09:15,073
Now, I was gonna tell you.

150
00:09:15,097 --> 00:09:17,450
I just

151
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:20,144
wanted today to be
perfect for all of us.

152
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:24,415
Okay.

153
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:28,461
Hey, Mia, come on. Look, let's just
talk about this for a second. Okay?

154
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:29,879
I mean, there's
nothing to talk about.

155
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:32,533
And I'm so stupid for
thinking that there ever was.

156
00:09:48,881 --> 00:09:50,301
Oh, hey.

157
00:09:51,175 --> 00:09:52,335
Hi.

158
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:56,197
Uh, I'll tell
Victor you're here.

159
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:58,221
Victor, Felix is here!

160
00:10:01,018 --> 00:10:04,664
So, uh, my mom, she got out
of the hospital this morning.

161
00:10:04,688 --> 00:10:06,295
Yeah, she's doing really good.

162
00:10:06,319 --> 00:10:07,709
That's awesome.

163
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:10,717
Yeah, you know, I didn't, uh,
really know what to expect.

164
00:10:10,741 --> 00:10:12,714
Part of me was scared
she'd be on a ton of meds

165
00:10:12,738 --> 00:10:15,258
and a completely
different person.

166
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:18,595
- But, uh, then I saw her...
- Felix. I can't do this.

167
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:20,889
I'm really glad that
your mom is doing better,

168
00:10:20,913 --> 00:10:24,309
but I can't just pretend that
everything between us is normal

169
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:26,519
after I kissed you.

170
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:27,793
Okay.

171
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:33,818
- I like you. And you don't like me back.
- Which is fine.

172
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:37,869
But I think it's best if you go back
to being Victor's nerdy best friend.

173
00:10:37,893 --> 00:10:40,768
And I go back to being
his moody sister.

174
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:45,127
And we'll say "hi" sometimes
when we see each other at school,

175
00:10:45,151 --> 00:10:49,265
or when we're taking out the
trash or whatever. But that's it.

176
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,490
Hey!

177
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:58,914
You okay?

178
00:10:59,952 --> 00:11:02,096
I'm, I'm good. Yeah, but...

179
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,766
Not as good as you. I mean the

180
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:08,146
the tie, the hair, the face.
I mean, hot damn potato chip!

181
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:09,708
Knock, knock.

182
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:14,757
Good God, you two.
Give the rest of us a chance.

183
00:11:15,676 --> 00:11:17,113
You do look really good.

184
00:11:17,137 --> 00:11:19,030
You clean up pretty
well yourself, Salazar.

185
00:11:19,054 --> 00:11:21,581
Okay, if someone doesn't give me
a compliment about how I look,

186
00:11:21,605 --> 00:11:23,117
I'm not going.

187
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:26,788
Come on. We've got
a wedding to get to.

188
00:11:26,812 --> 00:11:28,248
You look great.

189
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:41,636
Don't worry. We'll
figure this out.

190
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:45,460
- No, we won't.
- But thank you for saying that.

191
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:50,752
Sparkling lemonade?

192
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:52,814
Lucy.

193
00:11:52,838 --> 00:11:55,108
Hey! I didn't know
you'd be here.

194
00:11:55,132 --> 00:11:57,569
I'm not a guest.
I'm a cater waiter.

195
00:11:57,593 --> 00:11:59,239
Hence the super cool bow tie.

196
00:11:59,263 --> 00:12:01,990
Well, you are rocking the
hell out of that bow tie.

197
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:08,194
Oh, God. There's Felix.

198
00:12:09,313 --> 00:12:11,628
He looks super cute
in that little vest.

199
00:12:11,652 --> 00:12:13,626
I thought you guys broke up.

200
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,461
No, we did.

201
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:19,775
I might not be as single and ready
to mingle as I'm pretending to be.

202
00:12:24,036 --> 00:12:26,848
If my boss asks,
you're thirty-four.

203
00:12:36,298 --> 00:12:37,838
Is this seat taken?

204
00:12:39,343 --> 00:12:42,103
No. No, you, you
look, uh, beautiful.

205
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:44,386
Thank you.

206
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:47,599
Where's Benji?

207
00:12:49,144 --> 00:12:51,774
Victor and Benji are on a break.

208
00:12:52,898 --> 00:12:56,211
Wow, Victor wasted
no time at all.

209
00:12:56,235 --> 00:12:57,879
They're just friends.

210
00:12:57,903 --> 00:13:01,783
- Please. "Just friends" is for two fives.
- Not a pair of nines.

211
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:20,360
HAROLD I vow to always
be your best friend.

212
00:13:20,384 --> 00:13:24,239
I vow to always put
your happiness first,

213
00:13:24,263 --> 00:13:26,063
and my ambitions second.

214
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:30,537
VERONICA I know there
will be tough days.

215
00:13:30,561 --> 00:13:34,749
It's on those days that I
vow to love you the hardest.

216
00:13:34,773 --> 00:13:39,671
I vow to always remember
that we are worth fighting for.

217
00:13:39,695 --> 00:13:42,735
Forever. No matter what.

218
00:13:43,949 --> 00:13:45,468
No matter what.

219
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:56,549
Hi.

220
00:13:59,965 --> 00:14:03,255
I think it's about time you
and I had a little talk.

221
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:13,413
So, to what do I
owe the pleasure?

222
00:14:13,437 --> 00:14:17,267
Uh, actually, I wanted
to bring you something.

223
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:23,756
A Tupperware of some chicken?

224
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,508
It's my pollo guisado.

225
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:27,597
It's what we were supposed
to have for dinner that night

226
00:14:27,621 --> 00:14:29,015
before the first day of school.

227
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:31,055
I remember.

228
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:33,249
I am sorry that I
ruined that night.

229
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:37,564
I'm sorry for a lot
of things, Benji.

230
00:14:37,588 --> 00:14:39,647
But most of all,

231
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:44,051
I am sorry if I'm the cause of
problems between you and Victor.

232
00:14:46,678 --> 00:14:49,949
Mmm. Thank you for saying that.

233
00:14:49,973 --> 00:14:52,869
Please don't let
me be the reason

234
00:14:52,893 --> 00:14:55,233
that it doesn't work
out between you two.

235
00:14:57,314 --> 00:15:00,944
-  Okay...
- I appreciate you coming here.

236
00:15:02,027 --> 00:15:05,317
But our problems are
bigger than just you.

237
00:15:07,658 --> 00:15:10,720
Too big for a couple of
sixteen-year-olds, that's for sure.

238
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:12,430
Hey.

239
00:15:12,454 --> 00:15:16,084
All relationships have problems,
whether you're sixteen or forty...

240
00:15:17,501 --> 00:15:19,062
Thirty-nine.

241
00:15:19,086 --> 00:15:22,899
What matters is how hard
you're willing to work at it.

242
00:15:22,923 --> 00:15:26,433
How much of yourself you're
willing to put into it.

243
00:15:27,928 --> 00:15:31,388
And I've never seen Victor put
more of himself into anything.

244
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:34,410
He even stood up to me.

245
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:37,455
For the first time in his life.

246
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:42,710
And we all know that Victor is the
world's biggest mama's boy.

247
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:46,204
But he put our whole relationship
on the line to defend you.

248
00:15:47,656 --> 00:15:49,656
That's how much he loves you.

249
00:15:51,869 --> 00:15:55,209
Anyway, I just needed
you to know all of that.

250
00:15:58,542 --> 00:16:02,689
Oh. Reheat that at 350
for twenty minutes.

251
00:16:02,713 --> 00:16:04,723
Don't you dare put
it in the microwave.

252
00:16:08,969 --> 00:16:13,074
Oh. I don't know if this
is for me. It looks so... creamy.

253
00:16:13,098 --> 00:16:15,952
I know, but YOLO. On three.

254
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:19,726
- One, two, three.
- Clink!

255
00:16:21,231 --> 00:16:22,771
Oh, my God.

256
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:26,203
- Yeah, I don't like that. Mmm-mmm.
- I don't see the appeal.

257
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:30,101
But they're really expensive, so
we should probably have some more.

258
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:31,485
No.

259
00:16:32,451 --> 00:16:35,911
- Thank you for inviting me.
- I'm having a great time.

260
00:16:36,622 --> 00:16:38,082
Me, too.

261
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:40,768
You know, you could
always live with me.

262
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:43,592
House is pretty big,
you're pretty small...

263
00:16:49,426 --> 00:16:51,596
Hey, kids. Do you
mind if I cut in?

264
00:16:52,763 --> 00:16:53,948
No.

265
00:16:53,972 --> 00:16:55,142
Thanks.

266
00:17:05,817 --> 00:17:08,947
- I can't do this.
- Hey, Mia, please. Just wait

267
00:17:15,577 --> 00:17:16,827
She'll come around.

268
00:17:18,455 --> 00:17:20,850
- Mr. Brooks.
- Listen, you don't know this,

269
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:23,689
but I have always respected
the hell out of you.

270
00:17:23,713 --> 00:17:27,816
Your drive, your success, the way
your suits always fit just right.

271
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:31,277
When I was younger,
I'd always think, "Man,

272
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:34,656
I want a big, impressive
life, like Harold Brooks."

273
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,699
I appreciate that.

274
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:40,411
But when Mia told me
today what you did,

275
00:17:40,435 --> 00:17:42,975
for the first time ever, I
lost some respect for you.

276
00:17:44,314 --> 00:17:45,984
Well, I'm very
sorry to hear that.

277
00:17:46,942 --> 00:17:50,679
Harold, you and I both know
that Mia never fully recovered

278
00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:52,966
from her mother leaving.

279
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:57,830
It is a miracle that she is the
strong, happy person that she is today.

280
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:00,849
But you doing this,

281
00:18:00,873 --> 00:18:05,963
ripping her away from her home,
from her friends, from me...

282
00:18:07,963 --> 00:18:09,923
I don't think she'll
ever come back from that.

283
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,050
All right? And
that'll be on you.

284
00:18:27,357 --> 00:18:29,397
- Hi.
- Hey.

285
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:34,215
I just wanted to tell you that
I stopped by Brasstown earlier.

286
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:36,843
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

287
00:18:36,867 --> 00:18:39,617
And I did my best to be
un-horrible to Benji.

288
00:18:40,829 --> 00:18:43,266
It wasn't easy and I don't know
if anything will come of it,

289
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:46,060
but at least I know I tried.

290
00:18:46,084 --> 00:18:48,634
Wow, Isa. That's...
that's great.

291
00:18:51,757 --> 00:18:53,735
Well, if you'd have
told me a few months ago

292
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:55,945
that my wife would be trying
to get Victor back with a boy,

293
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:59,429
- I, I wouldn't have believed it.
-  Yeah. Me, neither.

294
00:19:02,226 --> 00:19:05,663
Well, I am going to celebrate
my big mama bear moment

295
00:19:05,687 --> 00:19:08,458
- with a glass of wine and a scoop of...
- Chubby Hubby?

296
00:19:08,482 --> 00:19:10,009
We both know you
mean two scoops.

297
00:19:10,033 --> 00:19:13,025
- Yeah, but the second one is...
So small it doesn't count.

298
00:19:19,618 --> 00:19:21,474
Uh, anyway, I better get going.

299
00:19:21,498 --> 00:19:23,155
Yeah, I should let you go.

300
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,580
Goodnight.

301
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:27,498
Bye.

302
00:19:44,309 --> 00:19:46,456
Guess who got two offers
on the murder house?

303
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,082
Yeah, you did!

304
00:19:49,106 --> 00:19:50,542
Mwah!

305
00:19:50,566 --> 00:19:53,169
Well, come on. I got a
drumstick with your name on it.

306
00:19:53,193 --> 00:19:54,510
I know you like legs.

307
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,355
Hi. Have any more champagne?

308
00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:14,339
Could use a little
liquid courage.

309
00:20:15,716 --> 00:20:17,676
That jumpsuit is all
the courage you need.

310
00:20:33,609 --> 00:20:35,587
I'd love to.

311
00:20:39,284 --> 00:20:41,676
- I love this song.

312
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,017
R&B from before I
was born is my jam.

313
00:20:45,162 --> 00:20:46,582
Well, uh...

314
00:20:47,873 --> 00:20:49,173
Do you wanna dance?

315
00:21:00,761 --> 00:21:02,075
- You go waist.
- Okay.

316
00:21:03,847 --> 00:21:05,450
I don't think I've ever actually

317
00:21:05,474 --> 00:21:06,791
slow danced with a guy before.

318
00:21:06,815 --> 00:21:08,244
Oh, I definitely haven't.

319
00:21:12,564 --> 00:21:14,194
Lake, there's, um...

320
00:21:15,734 --> 00:21:18,574
There's something I
should've told you by now.

321
00:21:21,323 --> 00:21:22,413
Thank you.

322
00:21:23,617 --> 00:21:25,117
For giving me back my mom.

323
00:21:26,286 --> 00:21:29,206
And I will never forget
what you did for me.

324
00:21:32,459 --> 00:21:35,146
Even if I'm around at 100,

325
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:37,899
I'd still hobble
about and tell people,

326
00:21:37,923 --> 00:21:41,553
: "Lake
Meriwether got my mom the help she needed."

327
00:21:43,929 --> 00:21:45,929
- Well, I like your old man voice.
- Mmm.

328
00:21:47,015 --> 00:21:49,035
What's in your pocket?

329
00:21:49,059 --> 00:21:50,411
Oh.

330
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,637
Okay.

331
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,040
Will you excuse me a minute?

332
00:22:15,961 --> 00:22:16,980
Oh.

333
00:22:42,821 --> 00:22:43,798
One second.

334
00:22:54,708 --> 00:22:57,979
- Benji. Benji, wait.
- Wow.

335
00:22:58,003 --> 00:22:59,649
I can't believe this.

336
00:22:59,673 --> 00:23:02,051
- We're just friends.
- Okay, Victor.

337
00:23:03,008 --> 00:23:05,588
- I feel like such an idiot.
- Benji...

338
00:23:15,062 --> 00:23:18,333
That was crazy. I'm not
allowed to have a friend?

339
00:23:18,357 --> 00:23:20,277
I don't think
that's all this is.

340
00:23:22,194 --> 00:23:24,954
And I think you agree with me.

341
00:23:28,659 --> 00:23:30,869
Victor, I like you.

342
00:23:32,329 --> 00:23:35,499
The past few hours
have been incredible.

343
00:23:36,667 --> 00:23:39,837
The day we skipped school
together was incredible. You...

344
00:23:41,797 --> 00:23:43,377
You're incredible.

345
00:23:45,551 --> 00:23:48,471
I swear, I never meant to
get in between you and Benji.

346
00:23:49,638 --> 00:23:54,268
But when we're together,
it feels like magic.

347
00:23:55,644 --> 00:23:59,165
I can't stop smiling
when you're around me.

348
00:23:59,189 --> 00:24:02,899
Even when we're just walking next
to each other not saying anything.

349
00:24:04,736 --> 00:24:08,066
I've never felt more connected
to someone in my entire life.

350
00:24:25,257 --> 00:24:26,797
I'm gonna go.

351
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:30,430
Let you figure out your shit.

352
00:24:31,847 --> 00:24:34,557
But if you feel
the same way I do,

353
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:38,955
you know where I live.

354
00:25:12,638 --> 00:25:14,365
- Aah!
- Oh, sh

355
00:25:14,389 --> 00:25:18,246
- What are you doing in here?
- I am having a low-key panic attack.

356
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:21,039
Lake is down there and she
wants to get back together,

357
00:25:21,063 --> 00:25:22,773
and I might like someone else.

358
00:25:23,398 --> 00:25:24,478
What?

359
00:25:26,652 --> 00:25:27,742
Who?

360
00:25:32,074 --> 00:25:35,178
Your sister. She kinda
kissed me the other day.

361
00:25:35,202 --> 00:25:37,059
- What?
- Okay, first of all, are you gonna hit me?

362
00:25:37,083 --> 00:25:39,849
Please not the stomach, all right? I ate a lot of oysters...
- Felix.

363
00:25:39,873 --> 00:25:41,935
I'm not gonna hit you.

364
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:49,340
I, I didn't know it was
gonna happen, either.

365
00:25:50,551 --> 00:25:54,447
But we have the
best time together,

366
00:25:54,471 --> 00:25:56,282
and she is really hot.

367
00:25:56,306 --> 00:25:59,118
- Okay, I'm being really cool right now.
- Don't push me.

368
00:25:59,142 --> 00:26:00,352
Won't happen again.

369
00:26:01,478 --> 00:26:03,456
That being said,

370
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,708
Lake is Lake.

371
00:26:05,732 --> 00:26:07,862
She's the first
girl I ever loved.

372
00:26:11,613 --> 00:26:12,993
Wait, what's your deal?

373
00:26:14,116 --> 00:26:17,262
Actually, it's weirdly similar.

374
00:26:17,286 --> 00:26:20,306
- You kissed your sister?
- No!

375
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:22,830
Benji just showed up, and he
wanted to get back together.

376
00:26:24,001 --> 00:26:27,251
Which is all I've wanted
since we started fighting.

377
00:26:28,422 --> 00:26:30,900
But then...

378
00:26:30,924 --> 00:26:33,528
Rahim told me that he likes me.

379
00:26:33,552 --> 00:26:34,892
And he kissed me.

380
00:26:36,013 --> 00:26:39,023
And I can't pretend I
didn't feel something.

381
00:26:43,896 --> 00:26:45,106
So what do we do?

382
00:26:49,067 --> 00:26:50,587
Close your eyes.

383
00:26:50,611 --> 00:26:53,111
- What?
- It's something my mom did in the psych ward.

384
00:26:59,786 --> 00:27:03,183
Now imagine all the future things
you wanna do with your boyfriend.

385
00:27:03,207 --> 00:27:05,310
Go to prom together.

386
00:27:05,334 --> 00:27:08,730
Do the long distance
thing in college and

387
00:27:08,754 --> 00:27:13,054
fumble around awkwardly
with FaceTime sex.

388
00:27:16,345 --> 00:27:18,385
But then you beat the odds.

389
00:27:20,682 --> 00:27:24,812
You actually wind up together.

390
00:27:30,526 --> 00:27:32,106
Who do you see?

391
00:27:32,945 --> 00:27:34,905
Is there one person

392
00:27:36,114 --> 00:27:39,244
where it would kill you if you
didn't do those things with?

393
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:47,130
Actually... yeah.

394
00:27:49,044 --> 00:27:50,424
Yeah, there is.

395
00:27:53,173 --> 00:27:54,303
Me, too.

396
00:27:55,801 --> 00:27:58,181
Way to go, Mom.

397
00:28:29,543 --> 00:28:30,883
You remembered...

398
00:28:32,004 --> 00:28:34,554
That my mom couldn't have
those at the hospital.

399
00:28:35,674 --> 00:28:38,699
- It's not that big of a deal.
- I got them for her a while back.

400
00:28:38,723 --> 00:28:41,366
I just figured even though
we're not friends anymore,

401
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:43,950
it doesn't mean the woman
shouldn't get her chewy fish.

402
00:28:43,974 --> 00:28:46,984
- Pilar...
- I don't want to be friends, either.

403
00:28:47,853 --> 00:28:49,289
Um, okay.

404
00:28:49,313 --> 00:28:52,050
It's kind of rude and
unnecessary to say, but

405
00:29:07,789 --> 00:29:09,267
Hey.

406
00:29:09,291 --> 00:29:11,561
How'd it go with Felix?

407
00:29:11,585 --> 00:29:15,064
- Not amazing.
- Yeah, he sort of just

408
00:29:15,088 --> 00:29:17,088
disappeared.

409
00:29:17,716 --> 00:29:19,296
I'm really sorry.

410
00:29:21,178 --> 00:29:25,598
For what it's worth, I never
really saw you with him, anyway.

411
00:29:26,433 --> 00:29:28,443
Really? Who do you see me with?

412
00:29:29,478 --> 00:29:31,768
Someone totally different.

413
00:29:35,317 --> 00:29:37,317
You know, I'm just
about done here.

414
00:29:38,445 --> 00:29:41,275
Would you wanna go hang out?

415
00:30:03,887 --> 00:30:07,097
I want to talk to you
about Stanford. I, uh...

416
00:30:07,933 --> 00:30:10,290
I think I
made a big mistake.

417
00:30:27,786 --> 00:30:29,683
You sure you wanna do this?

418
00:30:29,707 --> 00:30:30,865
Yep.

419
00:30:32,833 --> 00:30:34,543
Let's go see my mom.

420
00:30:48,557 --> 00:30:50,618
- Mando, what are you doing here?
- Hey.

421
00:30:50,642 --> 00:30:54,622
I, uh... I brought hot fudge.

422
00:30:57,649 --> 00:30:59,359
You still have some
of that ice cream?

423
00:31:01,069 --> 00:31:03,173
Oh. Um.

424
00:31:24,301 --> 00:31:26,905
Simon. Hey.

425
00:31:26,929 --> 00:31:28,969
Victor. Hey.

426
00:31:29,806 --> 00:31:32,744
Hey, I'm so sorry. Things
have been crazy with finals,

427
00:31:32,768 --> 00:31:35,898
and, um, I totally missed
your DM, but catch me up.

428
00:31:37,856 --> 00:31:40,976
Actually, I... I think I'm good.

429
00:31:42,277 --> 00:31:43,397
You're good?

430
00:31:44,029 --> 00:31:47,759
Yeah. Uh, I spoke
to Felix about it,

431
00:31:47,783 --> 00:31:49,943
- and he helped me figure it out.
- Well, that's great.

432
00:31:50,786 --> 00:31:54,456
Yeah, it is. It's crazy.

433
00:31:55,916 --> 00:31:57,746
When I first reached
out to you, I...

434
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:00,420
I didn't have anyone to talk to.

435
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:03,983
And now I have all
of these people,

436
00:32:04,007 --> 00:32:07,547
because everyone important in
my life knows that I'm gay.

437
00:32:08,846 --> 00:32:11,596
You have been so amazing to me.

438
00:32:13,392 --> 00:32:15,352
But I think that...

439
00:32:16,562 --> 00:32:19,442
I'm ready to figure out this next
chapter of my life without you.

440
00:32:20,274 --> 00:32:21,274
Wow.

441
00:32:23,068 --> 00:32:24,778
I think you're ready, too.

442
00:32:25,445 --> 00:32:27,025
Don't be a stranger
though, okay?

443
00:32:27,781 --> 00:32:31,031
I won't. And Simon...

444
00:32:32,703 --> 00:32:36,163
Thank you for everything.

445
00:32:37,082 --> 00:32:38,922
Good luck out there, Victor.

446
00:32:54,516 --> 00:32:55,516
