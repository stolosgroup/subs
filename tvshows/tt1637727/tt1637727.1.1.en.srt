00:01:52,094 --> 00:01:54,530
Yeah, Linden here.

3
00:01:56,498 --> 00:01:58,308
Day 1

4
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:26,438
Day 1

5
00:02:38,681 --> 00:02:41,883
Back behind the tape.
Yeah, you heard me.

6
00:02:46,055 --> 00:02:47,523
Sarah, sorry about this.

7
00:02:47,557 --> 00:02:49,691
Lieutenant said
you were on call, so...

8
00:02:49,726 --> 00:02:51,593
where's the body?
Conveyor shed.

9
00:02:51,627 --> 00:02:53,762
Homeless guy found her
a couple hours ago.

10
00:02:53,796 --> 00:02:56,431
Jane Doe,
no I.D., wallet.

11
00:02:56,465 --> 00:02:59,067
Coroner's en route.
You're the first one here.

12
00:02:59,101 --> 00:03:03,237
Got to go up the stairs.
Follow the ramp.

13
00:03:03,272 --> 00:03:05,439
You'll find her.
You want me to walk you through?

14
00:03:05,474 --> 00:03:07,041
No. I'm good, thanks.

15
00:03:07,076 --> 00:03:08,643
You're out of here,
what, Friday?

16
00:03:08,677 --> 00:03:10,946
Nope. Today.

17
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:42,478
Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey!

18
00:04:43,614 --> 00:04:45,715
♪ For she's a jolly good fellow ♪

19

20

21
00:04:51,389 --> 00:04:53,958
♪ which nobody can deny ♪

22
00:04:56,161 --> 00:04:57,128
Yeah!

23
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:00,999
Bon voyage!

24
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:02,601
Give her a glass.

25
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:12,645
Rick, are you still here?

26
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,182
Rick?

27
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,454
Rick?

28
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:24,356
<i>Boo.
I so had you.</i>

29
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,191
Unh-unh, Charlie brown
with the football.

30
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:27,759
I think Lucy needs a spanking.

31
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:33,399
I'm not even gonna ask.

32
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:38,838
Where's Jack?

33
00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:40,239
Dropped him off at school.

34
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:41,741
Is he mad?

35
00:05:41,775 --> 00:05:44,744
He's 15.
It's his job to hate us.

36
00:05:44,778 --> 00:05:48,748
He'll come around,
or I'll make him.

37
00:05:48,782 --> 00:05:50,517
What does, uh, candy cane feel

38
00:05:50,551 --> 00:05:51,751
about, uh, Sonoma?

39
00:05:51,786 --> 00:05:54,620
Pop that damn thing
before Jack sees it.

40
00:05:54,655 --> 00:05:55,622
Okay.

41
00:05:55,656 --> 00:05:58,425
What time
are the movers coming?

42
00:05:58,459 --> 00:05:59,559
In an hour.

43
00:05:59,594 --> 00:06:00,794
Oh, Regi called

44
00:06:00,829 --> 00:06:02,596
and said she wanted to take Jack
for a spin on the boat

45
00:06:02,631 --> 00:06:03,697
before we leave.

46
00:06:03,732 --> 00:06:06,000
Maybe she can give me away
at the wedding.

47
00:06:06,034 --> 00:06:07,568
What'll your parents think
about that?

48
00:06:07,603 --> 00:06:09,303
Who cares?
What about you?

49
00:06:09,337 --> 00:06:12,072
You ready to do this?

50
00:06:12,107 --> 00:06:13,240
Do what?

51
00:06:16,845 --> 00:06:19,180
Sell the condo.
Quit your job.

52
00:06:19,214 --> 00:06:22,283
Move your, uh, kid away
from his cool friends.

53
00:06:23,986 --> 00:06:25,186
Marry me.

54
00:06:30,559 --> 00:06:33,694
You know I'm not one for words.

55
00:06:33,729 --> 00:06:37,598
It's a good thing
you only need two of them.

56
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,935
Mm. That's me.
Uh...

57
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:43,471
why can't you fly down
with us tonight?

58
00:06:43,506 --> 00:06:45,306
Candy cane wants to play.

59
00:06:45,341 --> 00:06:46,875
Yeah, okay.

60
00:06:48,144 --> 00:06:49,611
Tickets are
on top of the fridge.

61
00:06:49,646 --> 00:06:51,447
Flight's at 9:30.

62
00:06:51,481 --> 00:06:52,615
I do.

63
00:06:52,649 --> 00:06:53,983
What?

64
00:06:54,017 --> 00:06:56,952
Want to marry you.

65
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:03,292
Tickets on the fridge.
Flight's at 9:30.

66
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:41,228
No, we'll have
a few hours before the airport.

67
00:07:41,263 --> 00:07:43,764
It would be great
to take Jack on the water.

68
00:07:45,066 --> 00:07:48,100
It's a bad door.
Uh, w-what are you doing here?

69
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:50,303
Uh, who are...
can I help you?

70
00:07:50,338 --> 00:07:51,404
Yeah.
This is my office.

71
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:52,839
Who are you?

72
00:07:52,873 --> 00:07:55,008
I'm Holder from county.
Are you Linden?

73
00:07:55,042 --> 00:07:56,342
Sar, you there?

74
00:07:56,377 --> 00:07:59,445
Yeah. I got to go.
I'll see you tonight, regi.

75
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,047
Yeah, I'm Linden.

76
00:08:01,082 --> 00:08:02,582
I-I thought you'd be
out of here by now.

77
00:08:02,617 --> 00:08:04,417
But, I mean, if you need more
time, I can wait outside.

78
00:08:04,451 --> 00:08:07,787
No, it's okay. No, no.
Come on in. I'm almost done.

79
00:08:09,623 --> 00:08:11,024
I got it.

80
00:08:11,058 --> 00:08:13,226
My bad. I got it.

81
00:08:20,201 --> 00:08:23,137
So, I hear
you're moving to L.A.

82
00:08:23,171 --> 00:08:25,439
San Francisco area.

83
00:08:25,473 --> 00:08:27,641
Um, Oakland?

84
00:08:27,675 --> 00:08:29,343
Sonoma.

85
00:08:29,377 --> 00:08:31,379
Sonoma.
That's nice.

86
00:08:31,413 --> 00:08:33,347
Yep.

87
00:08:33,381 --> 00:08:36,717
Nice weather, ocean, beaches...

88
00:08:36,751 --> 00:08:38,752
Hate that shit.

89
00:08:38,786 --> 00:08:41,921
You must love this place, then.

90
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:47,026
Ouch.

91
00:08:48,996 --> 00:08:51,264
Crackhead thought
she was Picasso?

92
00:08:51,298 --> 00:08:53,299
Crackhead's 6-year-old son
drew it.

93
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,635
He get iced, too?

94
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:56,970
No.

95
00:08:57,005 --> 00:08:59,239
So, what happened to the kid?

96
00:09:01,809 --> 00:09:03,376
Don't waste time moving in,
do you?

97
00:09:03,411 --> 00:09:05,312
No. Uh, county cut me loose
early, so, uh...

98
00:09:05,346 --> 00:09:07,514
Well, you got
a tough act to follow.

99
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:08,682
You wrapped up here, Sarah?

100
00:09:08,716 --> 00:09:10,317
Yep. All done.

101
00:09:10,351 --> 00:09:12,586
Good. Got a call
down at discovery park.

102
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:13,587
Check it out.

103
00:09:13,621 --> 00:09:15,556
On my last day?
My flight's tonight.

104
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:17,224
You're still
on the city's dime.

105
00:09:17,258 --> 00:09:19,026
You can hand it off
end of shift, 6:00.

106
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,727
Go on. Do your job.

107
00:09:20,762 --> 00:09:23,631
Take him.
Show him how to work a scene.

108
00:09:23,665 --> 00:09:25,366
I know how to work a scene.

109
00:09:27,803 --> 00:09:29,604
Grab a box.

110
00:09:29,638 --> 00:09:31,005
We'll take my car.

111
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,807
All right.
Over there.

112
00:09:44,887 --> 00:09:47,588
They tapped me out of
the academy at first year...

113
00:09:47,623 --> 00:09:49,323
boom, straight undercover.

114
00:09:49,358 --> 00:09:52,093
So I was working vice, narco,
and...

115
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:53,361
I don't know.

116
00:09:53,395 --> 00:09:55,696
I guess narco
kind of stuck to me, so...

117
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:58,799
You? A u.C.?

118
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:01,668
I never would've guessed.

119
00:10:01,703 --> 00:10:03,003
Whatever.

120
00:10:03,038 --> 00:10:07,141
It's mostly like street-level
buys and busts, you know,

121
00:10:07,175 --> 00:10:10,177
Joaquim shooting Rakim,
blah, blah, blah.

122
00:10:10,212 --> 00:10:12,480
You think homicide's gonna be
any different?

123
00:10:12,514 --> 00:10:14,482
At least you got a bad guy.

124
00:10:14,516 --> 00:10:17,284
Yeah? Who's that?

125
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:39,505
Is that why you're running away,
Linden?

126
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:41,139
'Cause you don't know no more?

127
00:11:01,929 --> 00:11:03,897
Detective Linden.

128
00:11:03,931 --> 00:11:06,766
Where's the body?

129
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,100
Still looking.

130
00:11:08,135 --> 00:11:11,170
School kids on a field trip
this morning found this.

131
00:11:13,473 --> 00:11:15,840
This park's like tweaker central
at nights...

132
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:19,210
you know, ho-bags
bringing their tricks down.

133
00:11:19,244 --> 00:11:20,278
Could be some basehead.

134
00:11:20,312 --> 00:11:21,345
Owner's not an addict,

135
00:11:21,379 --> 00:11:23,280
at least not the kind
who hangs around here.

136
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:25,482
It's a wool sweater.
It looks recently cleaned.

137
00:11:25,517 --> 00:11:27,785
Brought it
to the coin wash. So what?

138
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,320
You dry-clean wool.

139
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,389
Do you know any tweakers who drop
their wardrobe off at the cleaners?

140
00:11:31,423 --> 00:11:32,457
Anything else?

141
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:34,927
This.

142
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:36,595
Atm card.

143
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:40,733
"Stanley Larsen."

144
00:11:40,768 --> 00:11:43,737
Guy loses his wallet while
he's getting his knob polished?

145
00:12:00,589 --> 00:12:03,658
You find anything else,
mark it, don't move it.

146
00:12:03,692 --> 00:12:05,326
And, uh, call in sex crimes.

147
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,560
This is theirs for now.

148
00:12:06,595 --> 00:12:08,296
Yo, we got here first.

149
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:09,630
Yeah, and we don't got a body.

150
00:12:09,665 --> 00:12:11,232
Not yet.

151
00:12:11,267 --> 00:12:13,034
You want to follow it up,
go for it.

152
00:12:13,069 --> 00:12:14,135
You're my ride, Linden.

153
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:16,271
So I'll drop you off
at the station.

154
00:12:16,306 --> 00:12:18,039
I need to finish packing up.

155
00:12:18,074 --> 00:12:21,076
I thought you were done.

156
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:23,011
Flight's not till 9:00,
right?

157
00:12:23,046 --> 00:12:27,382
I won't let you miss it.
Promise.

158
00:12:27,417 --> 00:12:31,085
Let's have a talk
with this Stanley Larsen.

159
00:12:42,597 --> 00:12:44,699
Oh, what's that stink?

160
00:12:44,733 --> 00:12:46,967
I'm here for the pickup.
I'm Stan Larsen.

161
00:12:47,002 --> 00:12:48,736
Yes. Come.

162
00:12:52,341 --> 00:12:54,042
Place gives me the creeps.

163
00:12:54,076 --> 00:12:56,710
<i>Nie panikuj.
He can hear you, Belko.</i>

164
00:12:56,745 --> 00:12:59,814
Osama here don't give a shit.
Do you, Osama?

165
00:13:02,084 --> 00:13:03,985
What'd I tell you?

166
00:13:06,155 --> 00:13:07,956
See?
Take, take.

167
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:10,692
Great.
Thanks for your help.

168
00:13:10,726 --> 00:13:13,261
My name faisal, not Osama.

169
00:13:15,131 --> 00:13:18,500
I'll bring
your paperwork by tomorrow.

170
00:13:18,534 --> 00:13:19,768
Shut up, Stan.

171
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:23,939
Hey, babe.

172
00:13:23,973 --> 00:13:27,276
Stan, you need to
get home right now.

173
00:13:37,421 --> 00:13:38,688
O-okay, you know what?

174
00:13:38,723 --> 00:13:41,892
That's gonna stay broken
no matter how many times

175
00:13:41,926 --> 00:13:42,993
you wave that damn roll of tape
at it.

176
00:13:43,028 --> 00:13:44,228
We can't afford a new one.

177
00:13:44,262 --> 00:13:45,429
I'll get belko to fix it.

178
00:13:45,464 --> 00:13:46,664
You know what?

179
00:13:46,698 --> 00:13:49,033
I am in no mood for that
"belko will fix it" bullshit.

180
00:13:49,067 --> 00:13:50,534
Oh, there we go!

181
00:13:50,568 --> 00:13:52,702
Good as new.

182
00:13:52,737 --> 00:13:56,206
Don't even look at that
"on" button, Stanley Larsen!

183
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,009
<i>I still got the touch,
Ukochana.</i>

184
00:14:06,116 --> 00:14:08,550
Oh, yeah?
Oh, yeah?

185
00:14:08,585 --> 00:14:10,953
No, no!
Aah, you're all wet!

186
00:14:10,987 --> 00:14:13,088
Get off of me!
Oh, no! Oh, no!

187
00:14:13,123 --> 00:14:15,324
Oh, no!
No, no!

188
00:14:15,358 --> 00:14:17,526
No, no!

189
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,595
You are in such trouble.

190
00:14:19,629 --> 00:14:20,863
No.

191
00:14:20,898 --> 00:14:23,266
You are useless.

192
00:14:25,803 --> 00:14:28,404
You are useless.

193
00:14:28,438 --> 00:14:32,242
Get off of me.

194
00:14:34,745 --> 00:14:37,247
You obnoxious...

195
00:14:38,282 --> 00:14:40,083
Come here.

196
00:14:41,152 --> 00:14:44,086
Mm. I got to go.

197
00:14:44,121 --> 00:14:45,988
Okay.
Goodbye.

198
00:14:46,022 --> 00:14:47,389
Come here.
Come here. Come here.

199
00:14:47,424 --> 00:14:50,026
I want to talk to you
about something. Yeah?

200
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:51,627
You got to promise me
you won't blow.

201
00:14:51,662 --> 00:14:52,662
I mean it.
I mean it.

202
00:14:52,696 --> 00:14:53,829
Tell me, baby.

203
00:14:53,864 --> 00:14:56,465
Rosie said
she'd apply for colleges.

204
00:14:56,499 --> 00:14:59,001
She just wants to go
out of state.

205
00:14:59,036 --> 00:15:02,405
Baby, that is a good thing...
come on...

206
00:15:02,439 --> 00:15:03,639
that she finally wants to go.

207
00:15:03,674 --> 00:15:05,408
<i>Well,
if it's what she wants...</i>

208
00:15:05,442 --> 00:15:07,076
Of course it is, Stan.

209
00:15:07,111 --> 00:15:09,145
I'm not getting into this
with you, again.

210
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:11,147
Mitch, o-out of state?
Isn't she kind of young?

211
00:15:11,182 --> 00:15:13,183
She's almost 18.

212
00:15:13,217 --> 00:15:16,453
You got to let her grow up
sometime, papa.

213
00:15:18,923 --> 00:15:20,657
I'll think about it.

214
00:15:20,691 --> 00:15:22,559
Okay.

215
00:15:22,594 --> 00:15:24,561
Stan, got to move.

216
00:15:26,397 --> 00:15:28,531
One more time, right here on the stairs.
Come on. Go!

217
00:15:28,565 --> 00:15:30,767
Stop being such a devil.

218
00:15:30,801 --> 00:15:32,935
You ready?
Yeah. Let's do it.

219
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:11,572
Jamie.
I'm just on my way.

220
00:16:30,025 --> 00:16:31,225
Hey, Darren.

221
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:33,728
Good morning.
Hey, how are you?

222
00:16:33,762 --> 00:16:35,330
Councilman Richmond.

223
00:16:35,364 --> 00:16:36,798
<i>Times poll just came in.</i>

224
00:16:36,832 --> 00:16:38,133
Adams closed
our three-point lead.

225
00:16:38,167 --> 00:16:39,835
Good morning to you,
too, James.

226
00:16:39,869 --> 00:16:40,936
Election's in 26 days.

227
00:16:40,971 --> 00:16:42,972
We don't have time
to be jerking off here.

228
00:16:43,006 --> 00:16:45,641
Wow. Not an image
I want in my head.

229
00:16:45,675 --> 00:16:46,742
Where were you?

230
00:16:46,776 --> 00:16:47,910
I, uh, slept in.

231
00:16:47,944 --> 00:16:49,611
You never sleep in.
I did this morning.

232
00:16:49,645 --> 00:16:52,780
I lost my watch,
which you, uh, took.

233
00:16:52,815 --> 00:16:54,015
No. It's mine.

234
00:16:54,049 --> 00:16:55,416
It looks like yours,
but it's mine.

235
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:56,917
What time do we have to leave
for the school, Jamie?

236
00:16:56,952 --> 00:16:59,619
10 till.
I'll gather the troops.

237
00:16:59,654 --> 00:17:01,555
He's more nervous than I am.

238
00:17:01,589 --> 00:17:03,656
And you're surprised by this?

239
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,925
What have we here?

240
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:08,027
It looks vaguely like
a man's timepiece.

241
00:17:08,061 --> 00:17:09,328
Wherever did you find it?

242
00:17:09,363 --> 00:17:11,196
On my kitchen table.

243
00:17:11,231 --> 00:17:13,098
What was it doing there?

244
00:17:15,101 --> 00:17:17,436
With the recent mall shootings, the press is
gonna hammer mayor Adams on the gang issue.

245
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:18,604
Give them ammo.

246
00:17:18,638 --> 00:17:20,372
Well, he killed
my midnight hoops tourneys

247
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:22,240
and after-school programs
four years in a row.

248
00:17:22,275 --> 00:17:23,742
That's easy.

249
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:26,111
"Now we have kids stealing and
dealing we could've turned around."

250
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:27,479
You write that?
Jamie did.

251
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:28,446
That's not bad.

252
00:17:28,481 --> 00:17:29,447
Mall shooters?

253
00:17:29,482 --> 00:17:31,649
Recent gang inductees...
somalis.

254
00:17:31,683 --> 00:17:33,952
Well, Adams was a fool
to ignore them last election.

255
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:35,553
He'll pay for it
this time around.

256
00:17:35,587 --> 00:17:36,787
60 thou and growing.

257
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:38,889
Registration in rainier valley's
through the roof.

258
00:17:38,924 --> 00:17:40,958
If you get them to vote,
we got a shot.

259
00:17:40,992 --> 00:17:43,260
Forum today
could be our turning point.

260
00:17:43,294 --> 00:17:45,995
I had an interesting chat
with councilwoman Yitanes

261
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:47,230
this morning.

262
00:17:47,265 --> 00:17:48,432
Ruth is talking to you?

263
00:17:48,466 --> 00:17:50,301
Not only that,
she's endorsing me.

264
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:52,971
We go public tomorrow.

265
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:54,806
Until then,
we keep it under wraps.

266
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,142
The only way we get
the unions is with her vote.

267
00:17:57,177 --> 00:17:59,011
Add that to the somalis...

268
00:17:59,045 --> 00:18:01,113
The election's ours.

269
00:18:13,261 --> 00:18:14,361
Hey, Seattle PD.

270
00:18:14,395 --> 00:18:16,897
We're looking
for a Stanley Larsen.

271
00:18:18,433 --> 00:18:19,533
He's not here.

272
00:18:19,567 --> 00:18:21,335
You his wife?
Yeah.

273
00:18:21,369 --> 00:18:23,604
Do you know
where we can find him?

274
00:18:23,639 --> 00:18:25,640
Uh, he's on a job.
I-I don't know where at.

275
00:18:25,674 --> 00:18:26,708
What about last night?

276
00:18:26,742 --> 00:18:28,342
Why are you asking about Stan?

277
00:18:28,377 --> 00:18:30,745
Does your husband usually go out
at night, Mrs. Larsen,

278
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:31,780
and not tell you where?

279
00:18:31,814 --> 00:18:32,914
No.

280
00:18:32,949 --> 00:18:35,117
Stan's always home
with me and the kids.

281
00:18:35,152 --> 00:18:36,352
Last night, too?

282
00:18:36,386 --> 00:18:37,720
Yeah.

283
00:18:37,754 --> 00:18:41,191
We got home late from
a camping trip, so he was here.

284
00:18:41,225 --> 00:18:43,827
Have him call us
when he gets in.

285
00:18:46,163 --> 00:18:48,631
Are you sure
he stayed in last night?

286
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:50,233
Yeah. I'm sure.

287
00:18:50,267 --> 00:18:51,300
How?

288
00:18:51,335 --> 00:18:54,236
How do you think?

289
00:18:56,105 --> 00:18:59,374
We just wait
for this prick to call?

290
00:19:00,576 --> 00:19:02,544
In situations like this,
I like to ask myself,

291
00:19:02,578 --> 00:19:04,412
"what would Jesus do?"

292
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:09,851
Don't know.
I'll ask him.

293
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,861
Mrs. Larsen,
do you have a daughter?

294
00:19:20,264 --> 00:19:22,332
Yeah. Why?

295
00:19:22,366 --> 00:19:24,401
Did she go on
that camping trip, too?

296
00:19:24,436 --> 00:19:26,437
No. She stayed.
She stayed here for the weekend.

297
00:19:26,471 --> 00:19:27,838
She stayed at a friend's house.

298
00:19:27,872 --> 00:19:30,507
When did you talk to her last?

299
00:19:36,346 --> 00:19:40,282
Um, Friday.
Right before we left town.

300
00:19:42,918 --> 00:19:44,285
Why?

301
00:19:52,393 --> 00:19:55,262
Did you see Rosie in chem?
Unh-unh.

302
00:19:59,734 --> 00:20:01,268
All right.
Settle down, guys.

303
00:20:01,302 --> 00:20:03,170
We don't have
a lot of time today.

304
00:20:03,204 --> 00:20:05,972
You guys got your questions
ready for the candidates?

305
00:20:06,007 --> 00:20:07,808
Yeah?
Did anyone do their reading?

306
00:20:07,842 --> 00:20:10,176
Anyone? Anyone?
Sterling?

307
00:20:10,211 --> 00:20:11,377
What?

308
00:20:11,412 --> 00:20:13,113
Your question or your cellphone.
Your call.

309
00:20:15,683 --> 00:20:18,018
I'm looking for Rosie Larsen.

310
00:20:19,855 --> 00:20:21,956
Um, yeah. Totally.

311
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:23,224
Rosie spent the weekend
at my house.

312
00:20:23,258 --> 00:20:24,826
Did she come to school
with you?

313
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:27,928
Uh, like, I have a zero period.

314
00:20:27,963 --> 00:20:30,264
And I left early, so...

315
00:20:30,298 --> 00:20:31,732
Maybe she slept in.
I don't know.

316
00:20:31,766 --> 00:20:33,534
Sterling, are you okay?

317
00:20:35,137 --> 00:20:36,805
Oh, sorry.
It happens all the time.

318
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:37,972
Here.

319
00:20:38,007 --> 00:20:39,073
Thank you.

320
00:20:39,108 --> 00:20:40,508
Look, the candidates
will be here

321
00:20:40,542 --> 00:20:41,809
in less than half an hour.

322
00:20:41,843 --> 00:20:43,544
Can you make sure the seniors
are seated by then?

323
00:20:43,578 --> 00:20:45,412
Yeah.
No problem, Ms. meyers.

324
00:20:45,447 --> 00:20:48,216
Nice try.

325
00:20:50,052 --> 00:20:51,219
What?

326
00:20:51,254 --> 00:20:52,988
I told you.

327
00:20:53,022 --> 00:20:55,291
How about telling me the truth?

328
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,068
Rosie had dinner
with me and the boys,

329
00:21:05,103 --> 00:21:08,438
and then she went to that
Halloween dance at her school

330
00:21:08,472 --> 00:21:10,440
at... I don't know...
like around 6:00.

331
00:21:10,474 --> 00:21:12,709
6:00? That's the last time
you saw your daughter?

332
00:21:12,743 --> 00:21:13,710
Yeah.

333
00:21:13,744 --> 00:21:15,278
Do you recall
what she was wearing?

334
00:21:15,312 --> 00:21:17,913
Uh, you know, tight jeans,
a sweater.

335
00:21:17,948 --> 00:21:20,049
She said
only freshmen wore costumes.

336
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:21,083
What color sweater?

337
00:21:21,117 --> 00:21:24,653
I-I don't know. Pink.
Why?

338
00:21:24,687 --> 00:21:26,888
W-why are you asking about
her sweater and her clothes?

339
00:21:26,922 --> 00:21:30,291
Your daughter have a history
of running away, Mrs. Larsen?

340
00:21:30,326 --> 00:21:35,797
Rosie? No, never.
That's crazy.

341
00:21:35,832 --> 00:21:37,265
Did you have words with her,
a fight?

342
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,368
No.

343
00:21:39,402 --> 00:21:40,402
But you weren't worried

344
00:21:40,437 --> 00:21:42,104
when you didn't hear from her
all weekend?

345
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:49,612
I told you,
our phone was out of range.

346
00:21:49,647 --> 00:21:50,847
Christ, she's 17.

347
00:21:50,881 --> 00:21:53,882
It's not like we left
some little kid behind.

348
00:21:59,355 --> 00:22:00,956
Hello?

349
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:03,124
Yeah.

350
00:22:03,158 --> 00:22:06,927
Uh,
I-I don't understand.

351
00:22:06,962 --> 00:22:09,496
No, no, I heard you
the first time.

352
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:12,633
Yes. Uh-huh.

353
00:22:31,018 --> 00:22:32,952
Linden.

354
00:22:35,389 --> 00:22:38,490
That was Rosie's school.

355
00:22:38,525 --> 00:22:42,461
She wasn't with sterling
this weekend.

356
00:22:42,495 --> 00:22:46,298
Last anybody saw her
was on Friday at the dance.

357
00:22:56,511 --> 00:22:58,545
Press are falling
all over themselves.

358
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:00,648
Those kids can't stay awake.

359
00:23:00,682 --> 00:23:02,550
Adams knew I would come after
him on the gang thing,

360
00:23:02,584 --> 00:23:03,918
and he covered his bases.

361
00:23:03,952 --> 00:23:05,753
Expected countermove.
Doesn't take the shine off you.

362
00:23:05,788 --> 00:23:06,788
So why tell me?

363
00:23:06,822 --> 00:23:08,990
Because he's trying
to shake you.

364
00:23:09,024 --> 00:23:11,225
Obviously, it's working.

365
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:13,394
What's really wrong?

366
00:23:13,428 --> 00:23:16,164
Move in with me.

367
00:23:16,198 --> 00:23:18,433
Avoiding my question.

368
00:23:18,467 --> 00:23:20,701
You're avoiding mine.

369
00:23:20,736 --> 00:23:24,739
You can break hearts after
you get the single-female vote.

370
00:23:24,773 --> 00:23:26,407
You are cold-blooded.

371
00:23:26,441 --> 00:23:27,508
I know.

372
00:23:27,542 --> 00:23:29,911
That's my job...
taking care of you.

373
00:23:29,945 --> 00:23:33,214
So take care of me.

374
00:23:33,249 --> 00:23:34,449
Move in.

375
00:23:36,418 --> 00:23:39,054
Darren, I know where you were
this morning.

376
00:23:42,191 --> 00:23:44,659
I wish you'd talk to me
about her.

377
00:23:48,298 --> 00:23:50,900
Councilman,
the police are here.

378
00:23:54,871 --> 00:23:56,138
And you should be aware

379
00:23:56,172 --> 00:23:58,740
that the school is
a potential abduction site.

380
00:23:58,775 --> 00:24:01,310
We'll do our best to be discreet
with the media.

381
00:24:01,344 --> 00:24:03,378
Surely this can wait,
lieutenant.

382
00:24:04,714 --> 00:24:07,082
We can hold off as long
as you feel it necessary, mayor.

383
00:24:07,117 --> 00:24:09,285
Councilman.

384
00:24:09,319 --> 00:24:12,321
Can it wait...
your investigation?

385
00:24:14,992 --> 00:24:18,327
Missing kids are usually killed
in the first 72 hours,

386
00:24:18,361 --> 00:24:20,596
so, no, it can't.

387
00:24:22,465 --> 00:24:24,266
Well, then,
we'll have to cancel.

388
00:24:24,301 --> 00:24:26,135
A missing child
takes precedence.

389
00:24:26,169 --> 00:24:29,839
Gwen, uh, you can contact
my office to reschedule.

390
00:24:29,873 --> 00:24:31,707
Is that it, lieutenant?

391
00:24:31,742 --> 00:24:34,143
I apologize
for the inconvenience.

392
00:24:34,177 --> 00:24:35,711
We'll keep you updated.

393
00:24:35,746 --> 00:24:38,247
Let's go.

394
00:24:40,718 --> 00:24:45,255
Darren, I'd wager you were
quite the high-school athlete.

395
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:46,757
I never cared much for games.

396
00:24:46,791 --> 00:24:50,160
Hmm.
Councilwoman Yitanes does.

397
00:24:50,194 --> 00:24:53,564
I wouldn't depend on Ruth's word
if I were you.

398
00:24:57,502 --> 00:24:58,936
Assembly is canceled!

399
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:01,438
Return to your classes.

400
00:25:01,473 --> 00:25:04,241
Everyone, check in
with your homerooms, please.

401
00:25:19,191 --> 00:25:21,894
Sterling isn't in class.
I don't know where she is.

402
00:25:21,928 --> 00:25:23,028
I'm sorry.

403
00:25:23,062 --> 00:25:24,296
We'll need her home address.

404
00:25:24,331 --> 00:25:25,765
Yeah, yeah.
The office will have it.

405
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:28,534
You were chaperoning at that
Halloween dance, right? Yeah.

406
00:25:28,569 --> 00:25:30,069
Who was Rosie with?

407
00:25:30,104 --> 00:25:32,004
Sterling, like always.

408
00:25:32,039 --> 00:25:33,440
Did she leave with her, too?

409
00:25:33,474 --> 00:25:35,008
I-I didn't see.

410
00:25:35,042 --> 00:25:36,109
I was busy trying...

411
00:25:36,143 --> 00:25:37,277
do you recall
what she was wearing?

412
00:25:37,311 --> 00:25:38,845
Yeah, yeah.

413
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,947
Uh, she was dressed up
like a witch.

414
00:25:40,981 --> 00:25:42,382
A witch?

415
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:44,684
Hat, wand, pink wig.

416
00:25:44,718 --> 00:25:48,020
Most of these girls use
Halloween to play stripper,

417
00:25:48,055 --> 00:25:50,156
so she kind of stood out.

418
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:52,659
Rosie... she was a pretty
hot piece, though, right?

419
00:25:52,693 --> 00:25:55,829
Yeah. I wouldn't know.
She's 17.

420
00:25:55,863 --> 00:25:58,699
Kind of my point.

421
00:25:58,734 --> 00:26:01,068
Anyone hitting that?

422
00:26:01,102 --> 00:26:04,305
I-I don't think
she had a boyfriend.

423
00:26:04,339 --> 00:26:06,374
Ask sterling.

424
00:26:06,408 --> 00:26:08,843
Are we done here?

425
00:26:08,878 --> 00:26:09,911
Yeah.

426
00:26:09,945 --> 00:26:13,247
Call if you think
of anything else.

427
00:26:24,226 --> 00:26:25,393
Linden here.

428
00:26:25,428 --> 00:26:26,962
Is this Jack Linden's mother?

429
00:26:26,996 --> 00:26:28,296
Yeah. What is it?

430
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:30,398
This is his school calling.
We need you to come in.

431
00:26:30,433 --> 00:26:33,868
Okay. I'll be there.

432
00:26:33,903 --> 00:26:36,471
Put a car on sterling's house.

433
00:26:36,505 --> 00:26:37,872
Where are you going?

434
00:26:37,907 --> 00:26:39,340
And get a k-9 unit
out at the park.

435
00:26:39,375 --> 00:26:40,408
I'll meet you there.

436
00:26:40,442 --> 00:26:43,144
Hel... you're my ride, Linden.

437
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:55,524
Kris?

438
00:26:57,526 --> 00:26:59,594
Kris?!

439
00:26:59,629 --> 00:27:01,862
Kris, come on, please.

440
00:27:01,897 --> 00:27:03,698
'Sup, sterling?

441
00:27:03,732 --> 00:27:06,000
Where's Jasper?

442
00:27:06,034 --> 00:27:09,003
He's not at his house
or school or anywhere.

443
00:27:09,038 --> 00:27:10,738
Did he and Rosie hook up
this weekend?

444
00:27:10,773 --> 00:27:11,806
And I should tell you why?

445
00:27:11,841 --> 00:27:13,374
'Cause the cops
are looking for her.

446
00:27:13,409 --> 00:27:15,376
She could be in serious trouble.
I mean it.

447
00:27:15,411 --> 00:27:17,712
Give me a smoke.

448
00:27:27,822 --> 00:27:30,724
He's on the island
at the weekend manse.

449
00:27:30,758 --> 00:27:33,660
Parents are going to Abu Dhabi
or some diseased hole like that.

450
00:27:33,695 --> 00:27:35,196
Was Rosie with him?

451
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:36,764
Jasper scored some "x,"

452
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:40,035
so, uh, yeah, he was
definitely looking to bone.

453
00:27:42,505 --> 00:27:44,673
You're such an a....

454
00:27:44,708 --> 00:27:46,508
See you, sterling.

455
00:28:24,713 --> 00:28:27,148
Smoking cigarettes at school?
Really, Jack?

456
00:28:27,182 --> 00:28:30,852
It's not like
I was doing crack, mom. God.

457
00:28:32,254 --> 00:28:34,422
Why do I have to sit around
at Regi's anyway?

458
00:28:34,456 --> 00:28:35,923
Because there's
nowhere else to go.

459
00:28:35,958 --> 00:28:37,158
That's why.

460
00:28:40,629 --> 00:28:42,964
Did you give our new address
to your friends?

461
00:28:42,998 --> 00:28:44,299
Why would I do that?

462
00:28:44,333 --> 00:28:46,467
I don't know.
So they can write?

463
00:28:46,502 --> 00:28:47,635
Hello. Facebook.

464
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:49,904
Kids don't write letters, mom.
That's retarded.

465
00:28:49,939 --> 00:28:51,906
Well, it'd be really great
for them to visit, then.

466
00:28:51,941 --> 00:28:53,742
Like that's ever gonna happen.

467
00:28:53,776 --> 00:28:55,177
They'll love California.

468
00:28:55,211 --> 00:28:57,479
There's so much to do.
It'll be great.

469
00:28:57,514 --> 00:28:58,680
Hey, regi.

470
00:28:58,715 --> 00:29:01,249
Rick's putting together
a party,

471
00:29:01,284 --> 00:29:03,151
get some of the neighborhood
kids together.

472
00:29:03,186 --> 00:29:04,819
He's not my dad.

473
00:29:08,091 --> 00:29:10,859
Hang on.

474
00:29:10,893 --> 00:29:12,027
Linden here.

475
00:29:12,061 --> 00:29:13,561
Hey, it's me.

476
00:29:13,596 --> 00:29:14,829
Yeah.
What is it, Holder?

477
00:29:14,863 --> 00:29:17,499
We got the k-9 unit here,
starting a sweep of the field.

478
00:29:17,533 --> 00:29:19,467
Okay. I'll be there.

479
00:29:23,906 --> 00:29:26,074
He's trying his best.

480
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:31,713
We're gonna be really happy
in California.

481
00:29:31,747 --> 00:29:32,881
It's gonna be great.

482
00:29:35,084 --> 00:29:36,518
Jack?

483
00:29:40,924 --> 00:29:42,825
I got to go.

484
00:29:56,508 --> 00:29:57,975
How you been?

485
00:29:58,009 --> 00:30:01,078
All right.
What's going on?

486
00:30:03,081 --> 00:30:06,417
Stan, just call me, all right?

487
00:30:12,357 --> 00:30:14,292
Rosie, we're home!

488
00:30:14,326 --> 00:30:16,394
Mom, Rosie promised
to bring us biking at the docks.

489
00:30:16,428 --> 00:30:17,662
Can we go, please?

490
00:30:17,696 --> 00:30:19,030
Please! Please!

491
00:30:19,065 --> 00:30:21,500
Wow! Can't even
hear myself think here.

492
00:30:21,534 --> 00:30:23,302
What'd you feed them, Terry?

493
00:30:23,336 --> 00:30:25,371
Bag of sugar with a red bull chaser.
And it was awesome.

494
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:26,673
Go put your backpacks away,

495
00:30:26,707 --> 00:30:28,041
and aunt Terry will
give you more candy.

496
00:30:28,075 --> 00:30:29,910
Awesome! Yes!

497
00:30:29,944 --> 00:30:31,077
Rosie?

498
00:30:31,112 --> 00:30:32,112
Any word on Rosie?

499
00:30:32,146 --> 00:30:34,280
No. And Stan's
not answering his phone.

500
00:30:34,315 --> 00:30:35,582
What'd the cops say?

501
00:30:35,616 --> 00:30:36,850
Nothing.

502
00:30:36,884 --> 00:30:38,651
They just asked me
a bunch of bullshit, as usual.

503
00:30:38,685 --> 00:30:40,519
Mom...

504
00:30:40,553 --> 00:30:42,154
Mom, where is Rosie?!

505
00:30:42,188 --> 00:30:43,422
She promised we'd go biking!

506
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:44,756
She promised!

507
00:30:44,791 --> 00:30:46,291
Denny! Quit your yelling.
I mean it.

508
00:30:46,326 --> 00:30:48,160
Rosie's still at school.
I'll take you.

509
00:30:48,194 --> 00:30:49,861
Go.

510
00:30:49,896 --> 00:30:51,263
Go.
Get your helmets. Go.

511
00:30:53,733 --> 00:30:56,302
Sorry. I'm just going
a little nuts right here.

512
00:30:56,336 --> 00:30:58,037
I'm telling you,

513
00:30:58,071 --> 00:30:59,372
that girl's getting the a... kicking
of her life when she gets home.

514
00:30:59,407 --> 00:31:01,040
Look, don't worry.

515
00:31:01,075 --> 00:31:03,577
She'll turn up.

516
00:31:05,313 --> 00:31:07,047
Come on!

517
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:13,288
Stan.

518
00:31:13,322 --> 00:31:16,824
Stan, listen, um, it's Rosie.

519
00:31:38,212 --> 00:31:41,581
Why did she lie to us?
And where the hell has she been?

520
00:31:41,616 --> 00:31:43,817
She still dating
that rich jackoff?

521
00:31:43,851 --> 00:31:44,918
What? Jasper? No.

522
00:31:44,953 --> 00:31:47,221
S-she broke up with him
last summer.

523
00:31:47,255 --> 00:31:49,724
What, now sterling's run off,
nobody can find her?

524
00:31:49,758 --> 00:31:50,892
What the hell is going on?

525
00:31:50,926 --> 00:31:53,194
Just stay here
in case Rosie comes back.

526
00:31:53,229 --> 00:31:54,562
I'm going out.

527
00:31:54,597 --> 00:31:58,433
Stan, the cops were asking
about birthmarks and scars

528
00:31:58,467 --> 00:32:01,869
and jewelry and anything
they could identify her with.

529
00:32:01,904 --> 00:32:03,404
So I told them about,
you know, that...

530
00:32:03,438 --> 00:32:06,106
that necklace she always wears,
that little butterfly necklace?

531
00:32:06,141 --> 00:32:07,774
Why are they asking about that?

532
00:32:07,809 --> 00:32:08,876
She's 17.

533
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:09,943
She's dumb.

534
00:32:09,978 --> 00:32:11,778
She's not thinking about
anybody but herself.

535
00:32:11,813 --> 00:32:13,680
Yeah.

536
00:32:13,715 --> 00:32:14,748
Yeah.

537
00:32:17,952 --> 00:32:20,954
I'll find her. Okay?

538
00:32:20,988 --> 00:32:23,757
Yeah. Yeah.

539
00:32:23,792 --> 00:32:25,826
Okay.

540
00:32:36,771 --> 00:32:38,405
What do you got?

541
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,174
K-9 picked up a scent.

542
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:42,409
Started at the fire road
where we found the sweater.

543
00:32:42,444 --> 00:32:44,411
Looks like she ran a zigzag
through the field,

544
00:32:44,446 --> 00:32:45,946
ended up here.

545
00:32:45,981 --> 00:32:48,449
You sweep for possible burial sites?
Yep. Nothing.

546
00:32:49,518 --> 00:32:51,819
I don't know.
Maybe she's not here.

547
00:33:01,496 --> 00:33:02,930
Where's the map?

548
00:33:02,965 --> 00:33:06,067
Dad's alibi checked out.

549
00:33:06,101 --> 00:33:08,503
The park ranger logged
vehicle plates at the campsites.

550
00:33:08,537 --> 00:33:09,971
Larsen's car never left.

551
00:33:10,005 --> 00:33:11,806
Did you have a talk with dad?

552
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,610
He's not a suspect anymore.
You need to have a talk.

553
00:33:14,644 --> 00:33:17,446
And get the unis
to do another sweep.

554
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,381
We did two, plus the dog.

555
00:33:19,416 --> 00:33:21,317
I thought you wanted to learn
how to work a scene.

556
00:33:21,351 --> 00:33:23,319
Been working it, Linden,
for hours.

557
00:33:23,353 --> 00:33:25,222
Welcome to homicide.
Clock never stops.

558
00:33:25,256 --> 00:33:26,690
I thought you had
a plane to catch.

559
00:33:26,724 --> 00:33:29,193
Detective, got something.

560
00:33:29,227 --> 00:33:30,828
Yeah. Linden here.
What is it?

561
00:33:30,862 --> 00:33:34,198
Got a possible burial site,
northeast corner of the woods.

562
00:33:40,905 --> 00:33:43,239
Adams announced his new
anti-gang funding package

563
00:33:43,273 --> 00:33:44,607
while we were at the school.

564
00:33:44,641 --> 00:33:47,109
Great. Now it looks like
he was on board all along.

565
00:33:47,143 --> 00:33:48,810
You shouldn't have canceled.
I didn't have a choice.

566
00:33:48,845 --> 00:33:51,646
Wait a second.
What if we play into this thing?

567
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,480
Missing kid, desperate family,

568
00:33:53,515 --> 00:33:55,483
you pulling out all the stops to
find her, campaign be damned?

569
00:33:55,517 --> 00:33:56,717
No, no, no.
This is perfect, Darren...

570
00:33:56,752 --> 00:33:58,619
Jamie......
Especially if the kid ends up dead.

571
00:33:58,653 --> 00:34:01,221
Jamie, shut up. Oh, come on.
Adams will look like the douche bag that he already...

572
00:34:01,256 --> 00:34:04,324
We're not using
a family tragedy for a...

573
00:34:04,359 --> 00:34:05,626
a sound bite!

574
00:34:10,532 --> 00:34:14,135
He knew about
Yitanes' endorsement.

575
00:34:14,169 --> 00:34:15,169
What?

576
00:34:15,203 --> 00:34:17,037
There any staff
we need to worry about?

577
00:34:22,877 --> 00:34:24,177
Richmond.

578
00:34:24,211 --> 00:34:26,179
<i>Darren, it's Meg.
The times called.</i>

579
00:34:26,213 --> 00:34:27,747
That reporter again...
He's asking questions.

580
00:34:27,781 --> 00:34:29,382
I can't really talk right now.

581
00:34:29,416 --> 00:34:30,917
This is important.

582
00:34:30,951 --> 00:34:33,019
He's asking about
when I worked for you.

583
00:34:33,053 --> 00:34:34,920
He knows about your trips.

584
00:34:34,955 --> 00:34:36,922
My trips are public record.

585
00:34:36,957 --> 00:34:38,558
Not all of them.

586
00:34:38,592 --> 00:34:40,226
Only you knew about those, Meg.

587
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:42,462
Gwen and Jamie
knew about them, too,

588
00:34:42,496 --> 00:34:45,900
and I'm not the one blabbing.

589
00:34:45,934 --> 00:34:47,402
I got to go, Darren.

590
00:34:47,436 --> 00:34:49,037
Thanks, Meg.

591
00:35:04,487 --> 00:35:07,356
Hey, Jinxie Jo.
How you doing?

592
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:08,857
Where is she?

593
00:35:10,059 --> 00:35:11,626
Where's Rosie?!

594
00:35:15,931 --> 00:35:19,968
She didn't tell me,
but his parents are out of town.

595
00:35:20,003 --> 00:35:21,103
And on Friday,

596
00:35:21,137 --> 00:35:23,105
she got really dressed up
for the dance,

597
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:24,607
and she does that
when she's gonna meet him.

598
00:35:26,076 --> 00:35:27,477
Jasper.

599
00:35:27,512 --> 00:35:29,980
She's at Jasper's house,
Mr. Larsen.

600
00:35:39,857 --> 00:35:41,124
Stan?

601
00:35:41,158 --> 00:35:43,626
Rosie's on the island
with that kid.

602
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:45,928
What? With Jasper?
Are you sure?

603
00:35:45,963 --> 00:35:47,662
Yep.

604
00:35:47,697 --> 00:35:49,531
I'm going to pick her up now.

605
00:35:49,565 --> 00:35:51,199
Oh, thank God.

606
00:35:51,234 --> 00:35:52,801
No more worrying, okay, babe?

607
00:35:52,835 --> 00:35:54,603
Yeah, okay.

608
00:35:54,637 --> 00:35:56,472
Okay.
Love you.

609
00:36:06,116 --> 00:36:07,451
Yeah?

610
00:36:07,485 --> 00:36:09,620
Found the Larsen girl
with her boyfriend.

611
00:36:09,654 --> 00:36:10,821
Friend gave it up.

612
00:36:10,855 --> 00:36:13,524
Sterling?
Holder put a car on her.

613
00:36:13,559 --> 00:36:14,793
No, he didn't.

614
00:36:14,827 --> 00:36:17,796
And I didn't authorize you
to bring in a k-9 unit either.

615
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:19,631
Did you talk directly
to the Larsen girl?

616
00:36:19,665 --> 00:36:22,801
Some teenybopper got laid.
End of story. It's over.

617
00:36:22,835 --> 00:36:25,804
And don't you got
a plane to catch?

618
00:36:28,274 --> 00:36:30,743
Linden, got something.

619
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:43,491
Mama!

620
00:36:45,928 --> 00:36:48,330
Wrap it up.
We're done.

621
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,053
Where is she?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, man.

622
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:15,089
You need to leave, like, right
now, or I'm gonna call the cops.

623
00:37:15,123 --> 00:37:16,991
Where the hell is my daughter?! She's not here!
She's not here! She's not here!

624
00:37:17,025 --> 00:37:18,659
Rosie?!

625
00:37:18,693 --> 00:37:21,662
She's not here.

626
00:37:21,696 --> 00:37:24,398
She's not here.

627
00:37:24,432 --> 00:37:25,733
She's not here.

628
00:37:25,767 --> 00:37:27,767
Rosie?

629
00:37:27,802 --> 00:37:30,638
Rosie, get up.
We're going home now!

630
00:37:34,142 --> 00:37:35,910
See?

631
00:37:35,944 --> 00:37:39,247
I told you Rosie isn't here.

632
00:37:52,148 --> 00:37:53,715
Let's go, Linden!

633
00:38:03,092 --> 00:38:05,526
Hey, babe.
I'm thinking pizza.

634
00:38:05,561 --> 00:38:06,995
How about we grab a couple pies

635
00:38:07,029 --> 00:38:09,029
after I pick you and Jack up
from the airport?

636
00:38:09,064 --> 00:38:11,465
That sounds great, Rick.

637
00:38:11,499 --> 00:38:13,634
Oh, I had this sick idea
for Sunday's barbecue.

638
00:38:13,668 --> 00:38:15,936
Jack's gonna be bored
out of his skull...

639
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:17,370
What's the holdup?!

640
00:38:17,405 --> 00:38:18,739
Give me a minute.
...So I'm gonna get

641
00:38:18,773 --> 00:38:20,774
one of those
bounce-a-rama things...

642
00:38:20,808 --> 00:38:23,543
- You said that 20 minutes ago!
- Throw him in there with a couple other kids,

643
00:38:23,578 --> 00:38:24,978
let them bounce the crap
out of each other

644
00:38:25,012 --> 00:38:26,146
while the "grown-ups"
get wasted.

645
00:38:27,481 --> 00:38:30,217
Come to think about it,
I might jump in there myself.

646
00:38:30,251 --> 00:38:31,318
No judgments, right?

647
00:38:31,352 --> 00:38:33,987
Let's go! Let's go!
U there, Sarah?

648
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:38,158
I-I think
I'm losing you, babe.

649
00:38:38,192 --> 00:38:39,826
Hello?

650
00:38:39,861 --> 00:38:41,862
Hello?

651
00:38:41,896 --> 00:38:44,564
Sarah?

652
00:38:44,599 --> 00:38:46,733
Where does the fire road
lead to?

653
00:38:46,768 --> 00:38:49,636
To puget sound. Why?

654
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:50,971
Sarah?

655
00:38:51,005 --> 00:38:52,439
Rick, I got to go.
I'll call you later.

656
00:38:56,077 --> 00:38:57,911
They found her, Linden.

657
00:38:57,946 --> 00:38:59,880
How far is the sound from here?

658
00:38:59,915 --> 00:39:01,582
Way on the other side
of the park, okay?

659
00:39:01,616 --> 00:39:04,084
The Larsen girl ran
in the opposite direction.

660
00:39:04,119 --> 00:39:06,754
So where are they going
with fishing poles?

661
00:39:18,467 --> 00:39:20,067
There's a lake
on the other side.

662
00:40:14,758 --> 00:40:16,526
Hello?

663
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,595
Mitch.

664
00:40:18,629 --> 00:40:20,663
Mitch, Rosie wasn't with him.

665
00:40:20,698 --> 00:40:22,031
Stop it!

666
00:40:22,066 --> 00:40:23,666
What? Where is she?
Mom!

667
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,601
I don't know.

668
00:40:25,635 --> 00:40:27,035
I'm at the park.

669
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:28,904
Why?

670
00:40:28,938 --> 00:40:31,006
You said they found
her sweater here, right?

671
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,040
Mommy!

672
00:40:32,075 --> 00:40:34,076
I-I don't know
that that was hers.

673
00:40:34,110 --> 00:40:35,144
Mom?
What's wrong, mom?

674
00:40:35,178 --> 00:40:37,413
Tommy, go...
go watch your videos. Go on.

675
00:40:37,447 --> 00:40:38,514
Yes!

676
00:40:38,549 --> 00:40:41,351
Why does he always get to pick?
Go, now.

677
00:40:43,121 --> 00:40:46,223
Stan, she wouldn't be
at that park.

678
00:40:46,257 --> 00:40:48,826
I-I don't know
where else to go, Mitch.

679
00:40:48,861 --> 00:40:50,628
Why are you there?
I-I don't understand.

680
00:40:50,663 --> 00:40:52,630
What is going on?

681
00:41:05,476 --> 00:41:07,377
Can you open the trunk?

682
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:16,920
What is it?
What's going on, Stan?

683
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:22,326
Stan?

684
00:41:28,334 --> 00:41:32,037
Stop! Stop now!

685
00:41:32,071 --> 00:41:33,973
Stan?

686
00:41:34,007 --> 00:41:35,074
What are you doing?

687
00:41:35,108 --> 00:41:37,042
I need you to get back
in your truck, sir.

688
00:41:37,076 --> 00:41:39,645
I need you to get back in there
and move your truck.

689
00:41:39,679 --> 00:41:40,812
Stan?

690
00:41:40,847 --> 00:41:42,081
Hey.
Wait... wait... wait a minute.

691
00:41:42,115 --> 00:41:43,315
No, sir.
Where are you going?

692
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:44,550
Stan, what's going on?

693
00:41:44,584 --> 00:41:46,785
Please, sir.
Hey.

694
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:13,380
Rosie!

695
00:42:13,414 --> 00:42:14,781
Rosie!

696
00:42:14,815 --> 00:42:16,683
Calm down. Step back.

697
00:42:16,718 --> 00:42:19,552
Rosie!

698
00:42:19,587 --> 00:42:22,289
Detectives,
we've got the father here.

699
00:42:22,323 --> 00:42:24,524
Rosie!

700
00:42:35,235 --> 00:42:37,536
Just let me talk to her.

701
00:42:37,570 --> 00:42:40,405
All right, all right.
Okay, okay.

702
00:42:42,842 --> 00:42:45,143
You can't be here,
Mr. Larsen.

703
00:42:45,177 --> 00:42:47,945
Is it my daughter?

704
00:42:49,915 --> 00:42:53,151
Is it my daughter?

705
00:42:53,185 --> 00:42:56,521
I'm sorry.

706
00:42:56,556 --> 00:42:57,723
You can't be here.

707
00:42:59,692 --> 00:43:01,761
No.

708
00:43:01,795 --> 00:43:03,329
No. No!

709
00:43:03,364 --> 00:43:04,631
Rosie!

710
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:07,901
Rosie! Rosie!

711
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:15,475
Rosie!

712
00:43:17,645 --> 00:43:19,412
Stan!

713
00:43:19,447 --> 00:43:22,248
Stan! Stan!

714
00:43:22,283 --> 00:43:26,152
That's my baby girl!

715
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:30,990
Stan! Stan!

716
00:43:31,024 --> 00:43:34,694
Stan!

717
00:43:49,045 --> 00:43:50,812
We ran the plates.

718
00:43:50,847 --> 00:43:53,982
Car belongs
to the Richmond campaign.

719
00:43:54,017 --> 00:43:55,884
Richmond?

720
00:43:55,919 --> 00:43:58,320
City councilman Richmond?

720
00:43:59,305 --> 00:44:59,824
