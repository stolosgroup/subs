1
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,810
We were in a store and a guy in that store...

2
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:14,520
...told us to put our uniforms on.

3
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:16,680
"What the hell are you talking about?"

4
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:22,161
He says, "The USA is in a war with Japan."

5
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:24,060
We couldn't believe it.

6
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:26,190
Well, our country was attacked.

7
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:27,500
It's different.

8
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:29,440
It wasn't like Korea or Vietnam.

9
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,000
We were attacked.

10
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:34,710
And, you know, it was a feeling that...

11
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,250
...maybe, we're just dumb country people but...

12
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,480
...where I come from a lot of us volunteered.

13
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:43,820
"Who would like to volunteer for the Tank Corps?

14
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:46,450
"Who would like to volunteer for the Air Force?

15
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:49,750
"Who would like to volunteer
for the Navy?" or whatever.

16
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,220
And then, they said:

17
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,690
"Who would like to volunteer for the Airborne?"

18
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:56,360
Somebody says, "What the hell's the Airborne?"

19
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:57,660
Nobody ever heard of it.

20
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:00,030
We came from a small, small town.

21
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:04,270
And three fellows in that town that were 4F...

22
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:07,170
...committed suicide because they couldn't go.

23
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:09,540
A different time.

24
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:10,740
I did things.

25
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:12,640
I didn't do them for medals.

26
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,520
I didn't do them for accolades.
I did 'em because it's what had to be done.

27
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,620
The guy says, "would you jump out of airplanes?

28
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:21,350
"You know, you got all your army equipment...

29
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:24,260
"...and you jump out of airplanes,
to fight the enemy."

30
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,560
These guys, they said, "Go to hell."

31
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:28,220
Nobody put up their hands.

32
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,270
And then, I don't know what it was brought it up...

33
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:33,230
...but the guy giving the speech was saying:

34
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,930
"But you get paid $50 a month more."

35
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:38,060
So, that made it a hundred bucks.

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,074
Watch Movies, Series & LiveTV
www.flixify.app

37
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,880
I want a whiff of chicken pie.

38
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:41,110
Okay, boys, let's get this gear stowed.

39
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:05,040
Fox Company... we go in five.

40
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:16,160
"In the name of the Father..."

41
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:24,200
1st Platoon, draw small arms.

42
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,060
Do you need a hand, Lieutenant?

43
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:31,600
Easy Company! Listen up!

44
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:33,500
Gather up around me.

45
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:36,010
Just move it up. Come on, gentlemen.

46
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:37,570
Let's go!

47
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:44,770
Now, the Channel coast
is socked in with rain and fog.

48
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:46,440
High winds on the drop zone.

49
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:48,980
No jump tonight.

50
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,610
The invasion has been postponed.

51
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:54,820
- We're on a 24-hour stand-down.
- Son of a bitch.

52
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,620
Drill sergeants, take charge.

53
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:01,960
Well, this is quite a surprise.

54
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,330
Not particularly.

55
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:05,700
It so happens I rather expected it.

56
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:12,080
Well, I can't see how you people
can pass up $80,000 for the Cause

57
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:13,630
For whose cause?

58
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,280
If you're so interested in serving a cause...

59
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:18,110
...why don't you join the Army?

60
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:43,110
I think it's clearing up.

61
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,680
You think it's clearing up?

62
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,240
No.

63
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:53,480
I think it's clearing up.

64
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:57,180
How are your men?

65
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,820
They'll be fine.

66
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,360
5:00 in New York.

67
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,520
4:00 in Chicago.

68
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:13,570
Happy hour, huh? Yeah.

69
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:15,230
Happy hour.

70
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,040
A couple of drinks.

71
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:19,640
Maybe an early dinner before the theater.

72
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:29,140
A civilized place for civilized men.

73
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,720
Should've been born earlier, Nix.

74
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,420
What, and give up all this?

75
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:56,410
We'll go to Chicago, I'll take you there.

76
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:58,380
Yeah.

77
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,520
We'll see.

78
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,090
Actually, you know who's from there?

79
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,530
Who? Oh, him.

80
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:19,190
712 days of that son of a bitch and here we are.

81
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:49,500
You people are at the position of attention.

82
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,670
Private Perconte, have you been blousing
your trousers over your boots like a paratrooper?

83
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:02,540
No, sir.

84
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:04,780
Then explain the creases at the bottom.

85
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,240
No excuse, sir.

86
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,080
Volunteering for the Parachute Infantry is one thing...

87
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,680
...but you've got a long way to prove you belong here.

88
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,850
Your weekend pass is revoked.

89
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,650
Name? Luz, George.

90
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:19,690
Dirt in the rear side aperture.

91
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:21,160
Pass revoked.

92
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:36,240
When did you sew on these chevrons, Sergeant Lipton?

93
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,080
Yesterday, sir.

94
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:40,280
Long enough to notice this. Revoked.

95
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:41,580
Sir.

96
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:44,380
Name?

97
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,850
Malarkey, Donald G.

98
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,560
Malarkey's slang for bullshit, isn't it?

99
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:49,490
Yes, sir.

100
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:54,230
Rust on the butt plate hinge spring,
Private Bullshit.

101
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:55,660
Revoked.

102
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:57,900
Name?

103
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:59,400
Liebgott, Joseph D., sir.

104
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:04,230
Rusty bayonet, Liebgott.

105
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,500
You want to kill Germans?

106
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:07,340
Yes, sir.

107
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:08,640
Not with this.

108
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:14,310
I wouldn't take this rusty piece of shit to war.

109
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:17,680
And I will not take you to war in your condition.

110
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,190
Now, thanks to these men and their infractions...

111
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:23,020
...every man in the company who had a weekend pass...

112
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:24,690
...has lost it.

113
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:30,590
Change into your PT gear, we're running Currahee.

114
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:34,730
2nd Platoon, fall out.

115
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:35,830
We have two minutes.

116
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:36,960
Fall out!

117
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,080
I ain't going up that hill.

118
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:49,050
Perconte, what are you thinking of
blousing your pants?

119
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,210
Shut up, okay?

120
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:51,380
He gigged everyone.

121
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,680
You should know better.

122
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,190
Don't give him no excuses.

123
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,450
Excuses?

124
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,650
Why don't you come here, look at these trousers...

125
00:10:57,730 --> 00:10:59,560
...get down and tell me if there's a crease?

126
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:01,360
Let's go on the road in PT formation.

127
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:02,900
Let's move, move, move!

128
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,800
Perconte, let's go, Perconte.

129
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:13,370
Private White, why are you not in your PT gear?

130
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,770
I asked you a question, Private.

131
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:38,940
Oh, Easy Company.

132
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,370
While you're running, don't worry.

133
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,230
We'll take your dames to the movies.

134
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:44,870
Yeah, good, they need some female company.

135
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,340
Where do we run?

136
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,580
Currahee.

137
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,810
What does "Currahee" mean?

138
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:56,040
We stand alone.

139
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:57,650
How far up, how far down?

140
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,520
Three miles up, three miles down.

141
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:01,310
And what company is this?

142
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:02,790
Easy Company.

143
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:05,230
And what do we do? Stand alone.

144
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:08,290
Do not help that man! Do not help that man!

145
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:10,360
We do not stop.

146
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:14,800
You've got 30 minutes
to get to the top of this mountain...

147
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,760
...if you want to serve in the Paratroopers.

148
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:20,770
Hi-ho, Silver!

149
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:47,860
You can make it up there.

150
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:48,670
Come on.

151
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:49,860
Come on, Alley, let's go.

152
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,070
Come on, Guarnere.

153
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,400
Christenson, come on.

154
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,970
I never thought I'd see the day, Private Wynn.

155
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,940
We are coming on 23 minutes.

156
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,570
That may be good enough for the rest of the 506...

157
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:05,490
...but that is not good enough for Easy Company.

158
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:18,200
We can make it, we can do this, come on.

159
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,260
I'm going to say something.

160
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:50,790
To who?

161
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,630
Lieutenant Winters.

162
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:58,100
What is it?

163
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,070
Permission to speak, sir?

164
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,340
Permission granted.

165
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:03,470
Sir, we got nine companies, sir.

166
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,270
That we do.

167
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,080
How come we're the only company...

168
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:12,550
...marching every Friday night, 12 miles,
full pack in the pitch dark?

169
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:14,680
Why do you think, Private Randleman?

170
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,620
Lieutenant Sobel hates us, sir.

171
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:25,560
Lieutenant Sobel does not hate Easy Company,
Private Randleman.

172
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:28,700
He just hates you.

173
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,900
Thank you, sir.

174
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,910
He hates him back.

175
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:37,270
He hates you, too, Muck.

176
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:40,980
Lieutenant Winters, I want canteens out of belts
with the caps unscrewed.

177
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:43,020
Easy Company, canteens out and open.

178
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:46,280
On my command, they will pour
the contents onto the ground.

179
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,880
On the CO's order, you will upend your canteen.

180
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,050
Now, Lieutenant.

181
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:51,180
Pour them.

182
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:58,520
Who is this?

183
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:00,860
Christenson.

184
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:03,230
Why is there no water in your canteen?

185
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:05,030
You drank from your canteen, didn't you?

186
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:06,970
Lieutenant. Yes, sir.

187
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,880
Was this man ordered to not drink
from his canteen during the Friday night march?

188
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:12,810
He was, sir.

189
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,370
Private Christenson,
you have disobeyed a direct order.

190
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:16,640
You will fill your canteen...

191
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,210
...and repeat all 12 miles
of the march immediately.

192
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:21,260
Yes, sir.

193
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,450
Fall out!

194
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,000
What in the name of God are you doing
with my company?

195
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:38,440
You're late and you allow troopers
to disobey direct orders?

196
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:39,840
No excuse, sir.

197
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,700
You're making me look bad, Lieutenant.

198
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:47,480
This is not Dog Company. This is not Fox Company.

199
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:50,140
This is Easy Company.

200
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:52,480
Under my command, this will be the first...

201
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:54,780
...and finest company in this regiment.

202
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,820
I want the names of six men.

203
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:04,630
Their infractions and your disciplinary
recommendations on my desk by 0130.

204
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:05,960
Is that clear?

205
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,960
What infractions, sir?

206
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:11,830
Find some.

207
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,700
So, what'd you do?

208
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:20,650
Picked six men and gave them latrine duty.

209
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,280
The lucky six?

210
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:25,340
McDowell, Toye, Perconte.

211
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:28,620
Lipton, Muck and Guarnere.

212
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,120
Why them?

213
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:31,560
It was their turn.

214
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,390
Sobel's a genius.

215
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,690
I had a headmaster just like him in prep school.

216
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,990
I know the type.

217
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:39,460
Lewis.

218
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:42,160
Michelangelo's a genius, Beethoven's a genius.

219
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:46,030
You know a man in this company
who wouldn't double-time Currahee with a full pack...

220
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:48,540
...just to piss in that guy's morning coffee?

221
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,470
Let's go, let's go.

222
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:55,380
Stand in the door.

223
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,640
1,000, 2,000.

224
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,310
You just broke both your legs, Private Gordon.

225
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,040
Are you trying to get killed?

226
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:03,490
No, sir.

227
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:05,990
Stand in the door.

228
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,330
Shit.

229
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:28,680
To the wall.

230
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:29,650
Over as a team.

231
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,550
Go on, against the wall.

232
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,950
Jesus, what the hell is this?

233
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:37,010
That's pig guts, boy.

234
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,720
Goddamn it!

235
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:45,900
Why are you here, Private Gordon?

236
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:47,060
To be in the Airborne, sir.

237
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:49,620
I don't believe you. Why are you here, Private Gordon?

238
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,070
To be in the Airborne, sir.

239
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:55,010
You have 50 minutes to the top and back,
and I will be watching you.

240
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:57,600
What are you waiting for?

241
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:43,650
Easy Company has the finest performance record
in the entire 2nd Battalion.

242
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:47,280
I believe every bit of that is thanks to you.

243
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:49,590
Congratulations, Captain Sobel.

244
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:50,920
Thank you, sir.

245
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:55,700
Isn't that Lieutenant Winters
leading Easy Company in PT?

246
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,170
Yes, sir.

247
00:18:58,370 --> 00:18:59,860
He's a damned good man.

248
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:02,270
I was planning on giving him a set of these today.

249
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:06,070
Why don't you do it?
He'd be proud to get them from you.

250
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:13,650
Pornography, contraband.

251
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:20,550
Non-regulation clothing, contraband.

252
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:26,030
This man had 200 prophylactic kits in his footlocker.

253
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:30,700
How in the name of God was he going to have
the strength to fight the war?

254
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,700
How is it Private Tipper...

255
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:37,530
...has spare time for so much correspondence?

256
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:41,840
Captain, are personal letters
to be considered contraband?

257
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:46,110
These men aren't paratroopers yet, Lieutenant.

258
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:48,380
They have no personal property.

259
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:53,680
What is this?

260
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:56,460
Anybody?

261
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,120
It's a can of peaches, sir.

262
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:03,530
Lieutenant Nixon thinks this is a can of peaches.

263
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,000
That is incorrect, Lieutenant.

264
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:06,900
Your weekend pass is cancelled.

265
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:11,200
This is United States Army property...

266
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:16,140
...which was taken, without authorization,
from my mess facility...

267
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:19,720
...and I will not tolerate thievery in my unit.

268
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:21,340
Whose footlocker is this?

269
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,010
Private Parks, sir.

270
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,420
Get rid of him.

271
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,890
All weekend passes are cancelled.

272
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,720
Officers included.

273
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,430
Carry on.

274
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,330
Lieutenant Winters.

275
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:51,180
Colonel Sink has seen fit to promote you.

276
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:55,350
As First Lieutenant,
you'll serve as my executive officer.

277
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:57,720
Congratulations.

278
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,210
Thank you, sir.

279
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:06,290
And, as a test of your organizational skills
and command potential...

280
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:10,530
...I am designating you mess officer for 14 days.

281
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,500
Report to the mess kitchen at 0515 hours.

282
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:17,370
Company breakfast to be served at 0600.

283
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:20,040
Yes, sir.

284
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:24,940
And, Dick, there's rain forecast tomorrow...

285
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:30,010
...so the company will have a light afternoon
of lecture and classroom instruction.

286
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:36,050
I think a special meal
before their afternoon off...

287
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:37,790
...would be a welcome change of pace.

288
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,060
Would you agree?

289
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:40,030
Yes, sir.

290
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:42,860
I like spaghetti.

291
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:54,400
Hold on, more coming.

292
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:56,710
These guys are packing it away.

293
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:09,420
This stuff is orange.

294
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:11,950
Spaghetti ain't supposed to be orange.

295
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,260
This ain't spaghetti.

296
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:15,320
This is army noodles with ketchup.

297
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,330
You ain't got to eat it.

298
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,730
Oh, come on, Gonorrhea, as a fellow Italian...

299
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,400
...you know that calling this spaghetti is a mortal sin.

300
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:24,340
I'll have it. No, I'm eating here.

301
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:25,710
Hey, get out of here.

302
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,670
Orders changed, get up!

303
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:31,340
Lectures are cancelled.

304
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:33,750
Easy Company is running up Currahee.

305
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:35,340
Move, move!

306
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:41,110
Three miles up, three miles down.

307
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:44,060
Hi-ho, Silver!

308
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:46,590
Let's go, let's go.

309
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,860
You're a washout, Private Hoobler!

310
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:56,300
You should pack up both your ears and go home.

311
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:57,930
Looks like Gordon's done.

312
00:22:58,010 --> 00:22:59,740
Aren't you, Gordon. You finished?

313
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:01,900
You do not deserve to get your wings.

314
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,950
Private Randleman, you look tired.

315
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:07,710
There's an ambulance waiting for you
at the bottom of the hill.

316
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:10,010
It can all be over right now.

317
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:12,490
No more pain, no more Currahee.

318
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,920
No more Captain Sobel.

319
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:18,720
"We pull upon the risers We fall upon the grass

320
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,850
"We never land upon our feet We always hit our ass

321
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:25,430
"Hide tidee, Christ almighty Who the hell are we?

322
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,900
"Zim zam, goddamn! We're Airborne Infantry

323
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:32,200
"We pull upon the risers We fall upon the grass

324
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:35,240
"We never land upon our feet We always hit our ass

325
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:38,770
"Hide tidee, Christ almighty Who the hell are we?

326
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:42,180
"Zim zam, goddamn! We're Airborne Infantry"

327
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:58,890
So, do we feel like we're ready to be army paratroopers?

328
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:00,160
Yes, Sergeant.

329
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,570
I hope so.

330
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:06,310
This'll be the first of five exits
from a C-47 aircraft scheduled for today.

331
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,100
Get ready!

332
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,950
Stand up!

333
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,450
Hook up!

334
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:15,450
Upon successful completion
of your fifth and final jump...

335
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:17,920
...you'll be certified army paratroopers.

336
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,990
Check equipment!

337
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:23,820
Sound off for equipment check!

338
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:25,590
Nine okay.

339
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,820
Eight okay.

340
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,020
Seven okay.

341
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:30,190
Six okay.

342
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,070
Five okay.

343
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,600
Four okay.

344
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:34,970
Three okay.

345
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:35,900
Two okay.

346
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:36,960
One okay.

347
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,740
There'll be a lot of men dropping from the sky today.

348
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:42,740
Hopefully, under deployed canopies.

349
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:44,540
Stand in the door!

350
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:50,050
I guarantee you're going to love it, Lieutenant.

351
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:51,920
Go, go!

352
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,960
Jumping from 1,000 feet AGL...

353
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:57,360
...in sticks of 12 jumpers per aircraft.

354
00:24:57,790 --> 00:25:00,960
All you have to do is remember
what you were taught...

355
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:04,230
...and I guarantee you,
gravity will take care of the rest.

356
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:07,360
Go, go, go, go!

357
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:13,970
Go, go, go!

358
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:21,080
Go, go, go!

359
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,240
Damn it.

360
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:53,640
And, gentlemen, rest assured...

361
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:57,310
...any refusals in the aircraft or at the door...

362
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:02,550
...and I guarantee you,
you will be out of the Airborne.

363
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:04,050
Four okay.

364
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,190
Three okay.

365
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:05,920
Two okay.

366
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:06,790
One okay.

367
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:08,630
Stand in the door.

368
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,460
Go!

369
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:28,440
1,000, 2,000, 3,000, 4,000, 5,000, 6,000...

370
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:31,040
...7,000, 8,000, 9,000!

371
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,780
Hi-ho, Silver!

372
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:45,600
Now just think,
if you had any class or style like me...

373
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:47,730
...somebody might mistake you for somebody.

374
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,770
You mean like your fucking sergeant?

375
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:53,030
I'm just kidding.

376
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:57,280
Congratulations, Martin.

377
00:26:57,350 --> 00:27:01,340
Corporal Toye, there will be
no leaning in my company.

378
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:05,180
Are those dusty jump wings?

379
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:09,110
How do you expect to slay the Huns
with dust on your jump wings?

380
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,790
Luz, just give me a drink.

381
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:15,660
Hell of an idea, Joe.

382
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,290
There you go.

383
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,030
Three miles up, three miles down.

384
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,270
Ten-hut!

385
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:35,580
Well, at ease, paratroopers.

386
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,910
Good evening, Easy Company.

387
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:40,610
Evening, sir.

388
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:43,350
Now, Parachute Infantry is a brand-new concept...

389
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:45,080
...in American military history.

390
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:48,090
But, by God, the 506 is going
to forge that brand-new concept...

391
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,130
...into victory.

392
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,290
Yes, sir.

393
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:54,130
I want you to know that I'm damned proud
of each and every one of you.

394
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,470
Now, you deserve this party.

395
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:58,160
Thank you, Sergeant Grant.

396
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,300
Sir.

397
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:03,100
So, I want you to have fun and remember our motto:

398
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,270
Currahee!

399
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:06,110
Currahee!

400
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:33,970
Petty.

401
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:35,240
Map.

402
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:36,210
Come on.

403
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,940
Ah, Christ.

404
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:52,890
We're in the wrong position.

405
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,630
We're in the wrong position.

406
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,860
We're textbook position for ambush, sir.

407
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:03,400
We should sit tight,
let the enemy team come into our killing zone.

408
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:04,900
They're right out there somewhere.

409
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:06,400
Let's just get them.

410
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:08,300
Sir, we have perfect cover here.

411
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,410
Lieutenant, deploy your troops.

412
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:15,940
2nd Platoon, move out.

413
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:16,980
What?

414
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:18,180
Tactical column.

415
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:41,900
Captain, you've just been killed,
along with 95 percent of your company.

416
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,640
Your outfit?

417
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:47,340
Easy Company, 2nd Battalion, 506th.

418
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:55,420
Leave three wounded men on the ground
and report back to the assembly area.

419
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,950
Goddamn it.

420
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,860
You, you, you.

421
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:10,230
Well, what are you going to do?

422
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,240
Nothing, just keep training the men.

423
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:15,440
Am I interrupting?

424
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:18,770
No, no.

425
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,970
Lieutenant Lewis Nixon.

426
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:23,610
Lieutenant Harry Welsh, just in from the 82nd.

427
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,980
Congratulations on the promotion.

428
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:26,950
Thanks, if you want to call it that.

429
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:29,420
You'll learn him pretty quickly.

430
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:31,820
No flaws, no vices, no sense of humor.

431
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:35,360
Just like your chums up at battalion staff.

432
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:37,260
What's up?

433
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:39,790
I'm hearing a lot of rumblings.

434
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:40,990
Sobel?

435
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:42,630
Just talking about that.

436
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,970
So, he gets a little jumpy in the field?

437
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:48,430
He gets jumpy and then you get killed.

438
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,070
That's nice.

439
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:53,540
Yeah, listen, if we discuss it,
I think it should just be amongst ourselves.

440
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:54,840
Absolutely.

441
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,710
2nd Platoon, ready?

442
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:05,880
Ready, sir.

443
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,150
Then get them in formation.

444
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:09,320
We're moving out.

445
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:11,760
Yes, sir.

446
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:38,450
Shut up, Cobb.

447
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,790
You got to admit it.

448
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:41,290
He's got no chance.

449
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:45,120
Either the Krauts will get him or one of us.

450
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,930
Who, Sobel?

451
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:49,130
He screwed up one maneuver.

452
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,960
Well, you know, I'm always fumbling with grenades.

453
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:55,200
It would be easy if one went off by accident, you know?

454
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:58,370
Well, now they must have put him in charge for a reason.

455
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:02,380
Yeah, 'cause the Army wouldn't make a mistake, right?

456
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:19,960
Going my way? Wherever the train takes me.

457
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:22,190
Where do you suppose that might be?
I haven't got a clue.

458
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:23,860
Yeah, come on, take a guess.

459
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:26,590
Atlantic, Pacific, Atlantic?

460
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,870
I'm not the intelligence officer.

461
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:34,280
Well, as such, I, of course, know,
but if I told you, I'd have to kill you.

462
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,780
So, don't tell me.

463
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:40,480
New York City.

464
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:41,850
Troopship.

465
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:43,280
England.

466
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:47,850
We're invading Europe, my friend.

467
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:50,520
Fortress Europa.

468
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,150
Since when do I drink?

469
00:32:56,330 --> 00:32:59,170
If I thought you'd drink it,
I wouldn't offer it to you.

470
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,970
Nix?

471
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:06,100
What are you going to do
when you get into combat?

472
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:10,410
I have every confidence
in my scrounging abilities.

473
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:16,320
And I have a case of VAT 69
hidden in your footlocker.

474
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:21,250
Really?

475
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:22,090
Oh, yeah.

476
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,620
'Morning.

477
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:30,200
This could turn into a real nice trip.

478
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:48,540
"Dear sir or madam:

479
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:54,010
"Soon your son will drop from the sky
to engage and defeat the enemy.

480
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:57,290
"Your frequent letters of love and encouragement...

481
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,830
"...will arm him with a fighting heart.

482
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:04,390
"With that he cannot fail,
but will win glory for himself...

483
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:08,060
"...make you proud of him,
and his country ever grateful...

484
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:10,570
"...for his service in its hour of need.

485
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:14,310
"Signed, Herbert M. Sobel,
Captain Commanding."

486
00:34:27,390 --> 00:34:31,350
Right now, some lucky bastard's headed
for the South Pacific.

487
00:34:31,430 --> 00:34:32,400
Oh, what I'd give.

488
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,050
He's going to get billeted on some tropical island.

489
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:36,000
Keep talking.

490
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:39,090
Sitting under a palm tree
with six naked native girls...

491
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:42,830
...helping him cut up coconuts
so he can hand-feed them to the flamingos.

492
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:45,130
Flamingos are mean.

493
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:46,470
They bite.

494
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:48,170
So do the naked native girls.

495
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:49,400
With any luck.

496
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,740
Hey, guys, I'm glad I'm going to Europe.

497
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,780
Hitler gets one of these right across the windpipe.

498
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:58,010
Roosevelt changes Thanksgiving to Joe Toye Day...

499
00:34:58,090 --> 00:35:01,580
...and pays me $10,000 a year
for the rest of my fucking life.

500
00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:04,320
What if we don't get to Europe?

501
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:06,220
What if they send us to North Africa?

502
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:07,420
My brother's in North Africa.

503
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,620
He says it's hot.

504
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,530
Really, it's hot in Africa?

505
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,120
Shut up.

506
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,170
The point is, it don't matter where we go.

507
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,300
In combat, the only person you can trust...

508
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:18,530
...is yourself and the fellow next to you.

509
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:21,580
Hey, as long as he's a paratrooper.

510
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,510
Oh, yeah?

511
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:25,550
And what if that paratrooper turns out to be Sobel?

512
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:29,310
If I'm next to Sobel in combat,
I'm moving on down the line.

513
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:33,450
Hook up with some other officer,
like Heyliger or Winters.

514
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,290
I like Winters, he's a good man.

515
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,330
But when the bullets start flying...

516
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:40,090
...I don't know if I want a Quaker
doing my fighting for me.

517
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,150
How do you know he's a Quaker?

518
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:43,390
He ain't Catholic.

519
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:44,660
Neither is Sobel.

520
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:46,570
That prick's a son of Abraham.

521
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:48,970
He's what?

522
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:50,540
He's a Jew.

523
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:55,340
I'm a Jew.

524
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:57,700
Congratulations.

525
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,910
Get your nose out of my face.

526
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:09,080
What's all that about?

527
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:11,330
Gonorrhea called Sobel a Jew.

528
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:14,120
Liebgott took offense 'cause he's a Jew too.

529
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:18,400
Fighting over Sobel, that's smart.

530
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:38,050
Attack!

531
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:43,820
No, you want to kill him!

532
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:45,830
Parry right, parry left.

533
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:46,930
Thrust!

534
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:48,290
Take cover.

535
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,660
Okay.

536
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:54,000
Yesterday, we talked about magnetic declination...

537
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:56,500
...and the "left add, right subtract" rule.

538
00:36:56,570 --> 00:36:58,130
Today we're putting it into practice.

539
00:36:58,570 --> 00:37:01,370
There are two basic types of fighting positions.

540
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:04,310
The first is the prepared position.

541
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:10,120
The advantages of a prepared position
are that it gives you cover and concealment.

542
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:11,850
Commence fire!

543
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,390
We'll then maneuver right in through these trees.

544
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:24,230
At the same time, our second platoon,
in this particular case, moves over here.

545
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:27,670
He's then going to close with
and kill or capture that German.

546
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:54,390
Sobel's late.

547
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:08,000
Why is there a fence here?

548
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:12,340
There should be no fence here.

549
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:15,050
Give me the map.

550
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:19,610
Perconte, Luz.

551
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:21,620
Get the men, get them...

552
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:23,380
Take cover behind those trees.

553
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:25,890
You heard the word. Let's go over there.

554
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:32,960
There should be no...
There should be no fence here.

555
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:35,000
We could go over it, sir.

556
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:36,630
Really?

557
00:38:36,810 --> 00:38:39,070
That's not the point. Where the goddamn...

558
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,210
Where the goddamn hell are we?

559
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:44,270
Perconte? Yeah.

560
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:46,710
Sobel's lost again, right? Yeah, he's lost.

561
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:47,910
Fucking Christ.

562
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:53,940
Can you do Major Horton?

563
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:57,720
Does a wild bear crap in the woods, son?

564
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:00,820
Maybe the good major can goose this schmuck.

565
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,160
Get us moving?

566
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,590
No way.

567
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:06,890
Yes. You got to.

568
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:08,960
All right, just this once.

569
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:17,570
Three-five-six-eight-three-three.

570
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:18,800
Isn't that the intersection?

571
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,070
No, sir, it's here.

572
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:21,510
You're a full grid off.

573
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,750
Goddamn it.

574
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,440
Is there a problem, Captain Sobel?

575
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,610
Who said that?

576
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,020
Who broke silence?

577
00:39:29,490 --> 00:39:31,890
I think it's Major Horton, sir.

578
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,220
Major Horton?

579
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:36,960
What is he... Did he join us?

580
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:40,260
I think maybe he's moving between the platoons, sir.

581
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:44,170
What is the goddamn holdup, Mr. Sobel?

582
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:48,270
A fence, sir.

583
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:49,800
God!

584
00:39:50,210 --> 00:39:51,910
A barbed wire fence.

585
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:54,040
Oh, that dog just ain't going to hunt!

586
00:39:56,420 --> 00:40:00,610
Now, you cut that fence
and get this goddamn platoon on the move!

587
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:03,920
Yes, sir!

588
00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:08,550
Where are my goddamn wire cutters?

589
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:11,930
We have to move.

590
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,470
Sir, without Captain Sobel and 1st Platoon?

591
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:18,000
It's a T-intersection. We improvise.

592
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:22,170
Double envelopment laid on a base of fire
to cut the road in all directions.

593
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:25,800
Hook right with first squad.
Tell Guarnere to move left with second.

594
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:28,940
I'll be right up the middle with third, go. Yes, sir.

595
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:52,840
Deary me.

596
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:05,450
Bloody hell.

597
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:27,000
You've done it now, Yanks.

598
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:29,270
You've captured me.

599
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:35,380
Hi-ho, Silver!

600
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:41,190
Would that be the enemy?

601
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:43,710
As a matter of fact, yes.

602
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,130
Good work, 2nd Platoon.

603
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,600
We took the objective.

604
00:42:03,810 --> 00:42:06,940
Who is the idiot who cut that man's fence?

605
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:08,170
I was ordered to, sir.

606
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:09,080
By whom?

607
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:10,340
Major Horton, sir.

608
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:11,850
Major Horton? Yes, sir.

609
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:14,310
Major Horton told you to do that? Yes, sir.

610
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:17,420
Major Horton ordered you to cut the fence?

611
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,590
Yes, he did.

612
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:23,390
Major Horton is on leave in London.

613
00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:27,790
Get those cows out of here.

614
00:42:56,930 --> 00:42:58,230
Lieutenant Winters.

615
00:43:01,770 --> 00:43:03,790
With Captain Sobel's compliments, sir.

616
00:43:07,070 --> 00:43:08,130
Lieutenant.

617
00:43:27,490 --> 00:43:29,120
Oh, for crying out loud.

618
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:31,400
This spells court-martial.

619
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:33,560
Wide open! Yes.

620
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:39,270
No, sir, I do not understand.

621
00:43:39,670 --> 00:43:43,130
Your orders to me were
to inspect the latrines at 1000 hours.

622
00:43:43,210 --> 00:43:48,710
From 0930 to 0955 I was censoring the enlisted men's mail
by order of Colonel Strayer.

623
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:52,680
At 1000 hours I followed
your orders to the minute.

624
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:55,410
I changed that time to 0945.

625
00:43:55,490 --> 00:43:56,550
No one told me, sir.

626
00:43:56,620 --> 00:43:57,680
I telephoned.

627
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,190
I'm quartered with a family that has no telephone.

628
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:01,660
And sent a runner.

629
00:44:01,730 --> 00:44:03,160
No runner found me, Captain.

630
00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:11,640
Irregardless, when given a task to perform by a ranking officer
you should have delegated your task of latrine inspection to another officer.

631
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:13,140
You failed to do so.

632
00:44:13,510 --> 00:44:17,130
Were I to let such a failure of duty
by my own XO go unpunished...

633
00:44:17,210 --> 00:44:19,510
...what kind of message is that to the men?

634
00:44:19,610 --> 00:44:21,870
I performed my duty as I was ordered, sir.

635
00:44:22,110 --> 00:44:23,550
And I disagree.

636
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:27,010
So, your options are quite simple, Lieutenant.

637
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:32,620
Punishment for your offenses will be denial
of a 48-hour pass for 60 days.

638
00:44:32,690 --> 00:44:34,820
Stand before me at attention.

639
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:42,300
Or you may initiate a letter of appeal
and request a trial by court-martial.

640
00:44:47,210 --> 00:44:49,070
You spend your weekends on the base anyway, Dick.

641
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:51,070
Be a man, take the punishment.

642
00:44:52,510 --> 00:44:54,370
May I borrow your pen, sir?

643
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:07,880
My endorsement, sir.

644
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:11,690
I request trial by court-martial.

645
00:45:23,310 --> 00:45:25,140
We lost Winters to battalion mess.

646
00:45:25,710 --> 00:45:27,440
You're shitting me. No.

647
00:45:27,510 --> 00:45:31,470
Strayer did it, while they try to figure out
the procedures for his court-martial.

648
00:45:31,550 --> 00:45:33,680
Nix better find a loophole and get him out.

649
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:34,840
And if he don't?

650
00:45:35,090 --> 00:45:38,750
Winters scrambles eggs while the rest of us
make the big jump with Sobel.

651
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:41,790
Not me.

652
00:45:42,590 --> 00:45:44,930
So we're going through with this, right?

653
00:45:45,330 --> 00:45:46,890
We've got to do something.

654
00:45:46,970 --> 00:45:48,190
Yeah.

655
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:50,890
All right.

656
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:52,960
Good.

657
00:45:54,610 --> 00:45:56,660
But we'd all better be clear on the consequences.

658
00:45:56,740 --> 00:45:58,940
I don't care about the consequences.

659
00:46:00,310 --> 00:46:03,070
We could be lined up against a wall and shot.

660
00:46:05,050 --> 00:46:06,950
Now, I'm ready to face that.

661
00:46:08,650 --> 00:46:10,920
And every one of us had better be, too.

662
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:20,050
I will not follow that man into combat.

663
00:46:23,230 --> 00:46:24,360
Me neither.

664
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:28,630
All right.

665
00:46:30,170 --> 00:46:31,400
Then let's do it.

666
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:46,950
"I hereby...

667
00:46:48,690 --> 00:46:53,280
"...no longer wish to serve...

668
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,020
"...as a non-commissioned officer...

669
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:06,800
"...in Easy Company."

670
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:22,090
All right, boys.

671
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:24,250
Good luck.

672
00:47:28,730 --> 00:47:30,290
I ought to have you all shot!

673
00:47:31,230 --> 00:47:33,360
This is nothing less than an act of mutiny...

674
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:36,500
...while we prepare for the goddamn invasion of Europe.

675
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,160
Sergeant Harris.

676
00:47:38,310 --> 00:47:38,970
Sir.

677
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:41,030
Turn in your stripes, collect your gear.

678
00:47:41,110 --> 00:47:43,870
You are hereby transferred out of my regiment.

679
00:47:44,110 --> 00:47:44,810
Sir.

680
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:45,710
Get out.

681
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:48,650
Sergeant Ranney.

682
00:47:48,790 --> 00:47:50,010
Sir.

683
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:53,250
You consider yourself lucky,
I'm only busting you to private.

684
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:57,360
All of you NCOs have disgraced the 101st Airborne.

685
00:47:57,430 --> 00:48:02,360
Consider yourself lucky that we are on the eve
of the largest action in the history of warfare...

686
00:48:02,470 --> 00:48:06,330
...which leaves me no choice but to spare your lives.

687
00:48:09,710 --> 00:48:12,470
Now, get out of my office and get out of my sight.

688
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:14,200
Get.

689
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:32,590
Keep them coming, atta-boy.

690
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:10,020
I can only speculate, sir.
Most of the men would never do this...

691
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:14,190
...but I believe just a few
of the sergeants may have felt...

692
00:49:14,270 --> 00:49:18,070
...their loyalty lay more to the platoon
than to the company.

693
00:49:18,970 --> 00:49:22,570
And these few sergeants convinced
all of the other NCOs in your company...

694
00:49:22,650 --> 00:49:23,910
...to turn in their stripes?

695
00:49:23,980 --> 00:49:25,940
As staff sergeants,
they have a great amount of influence, sir.

696
00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:27,740
But as I say, the rest are good men.

697
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:30,240
I know them, I can work with them.

698
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:39,720
This business with the Winters' court-martial...

699
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:41,990
...has been an unpleasant distraction.

700
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:44,050
Indeed it has, sir.

701
00:49:44,730 --> 00:49:46,220
However...

702
00:49:46,870 --> 00:49:49,670
...your command of Easy Company has been exemplary.

703
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:51,530
Thank you, sir.

704
00:49:52,170 --> 00:49:56,580
In fact, except for the actions
of a few of your non-coms...

705
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:01,810
...I believe you've fielded
one of the finest companies of soldiers I've ever seen.

706
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:03,040
Yes, sir.

707
00:50:04,390 --> 00:50:06,880
Herbert, Division has established...

708
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:09,390
...a parachute training school at Chilton Foliat.

709
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:12,910
The idea is for non-infantry types who...

710
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:15,560
...were vital to the coming invasion...

711
00:50:15,630 --> 00:50:19,330
...such as doctors and chaplains,
to take jump training there.

712
00:50:20,970 --> 00:50:23,100
I can't think of anyone more qualified...

713
00:50:23,170 --> 00:50:25,730
...to command such a school than you are.

714
00:50:29,110 --> 00:50:30,580
Sir?

715
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:36,210
I'm reassigning you to Chilton Foliat.

716
00:50:45,430 --> 00:50:47,390
I'm losing Easy Company?

717
00:50:47,530 --> 00:50:49,520
The war effort needs you elsewhere.

718
00:50:56,570 --> 00:50:58,060
Permission to speak, sir?

719
00:50:58,210 --> 00:50:59,370
Granted.

720
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:06,370
Is... Who will be replacing me?

721
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:09,740
Lieutenant Meehan from Baker Company is senior.

722
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:14,290
Good luck at Chilton Foliat, Herbert.

723
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:15,950
Don't let us down now.

724
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:23,920
No, sir.

725
00:51:31,270 --> 00:51:33,070
Carry on.

726
00:52:26,330 --> 00:52:27,760
2nd Platoon, listen up.

727
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:30,660
I want the first squad and A-side tents right up there.

728
00:52:31,230 --> 00:52:33,630
Third squad, second row...

729
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:49,880
Holy shit.

730
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:53,150
No, it's all right. We're tommies...

731
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:54,580
...not bleeding boche.

732
00:52:54,660 --> 00:52:55,850
Is all this real?

733
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:56,940
Yeah, yeah.

734
00:52:57,020 --> 00:52:59,720
Some is from the Hermans,
somebody's tailor's knocked up.

735
00:52:59,790 --> 00:53:02,760
For you, so you can get your mince pies
on this Jerry clobber...

736
00:53:02,830 --> 00:53:04,160
...if you know what I mean.

737
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:05,390
Not really.

738
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:07,290
Mack, you got a Luger?

739
00:53:07,370 --> 00:53:09,030
I'm dying to get a real Luger.

740
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:10,300
Yeah, go on then.

741
00:53:12,470 --> 00:53:14,030
A quick butchers, yeah?

742
00:53:18,050 --> 00:53:19,940
Boy, she sure is a doozy.

743
00:53:20,010 --> 00:53:21,310
Yeah, it's pukka, ain't it?

744
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:22,310
What?

745
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:25,340
Hey, Petty.

746
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:27,120
Hey, mate.

747
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:31,720
You're having a bath if you think
you're half-inching that.

748
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:33,520
Oh, yeah.

749
00:53:33,590 --> 00:53:35,320
Sorry. Well, good luck.

750
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:36,590
You too, mate.

751
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:39,730
What's up, Hoobs?

752
00:53:40,630 --> 00:53:44,630
These men have been through
the toughest training the Army has to offer.

753
00:53:44,770 --> 00:53:46,860
Under the worst possible circumstances.

754
00:53:47,970 --> 00:53:49,500
And they volunteered for it.

755
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:52,670
Christ, I was just shooting craps with them.
It's not like...

756
00:53:52,750 --> 00:53:54,540
You know why they volunteered?

757
00:53:54,610 --> 00:53:59,520
So, when things got really bad,
the man next to them would be the best.

758
00:54:00,150 --> 00:54:02,710
Not some draftee who's going to get him killed.

759
00:54:02,790 --> 00:54:04,760
Are you ticked because they like me?

760
00:54:05,190 --> 00:54:07,780
Because I'm spending time
to get to know my soldiers?

761
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:10,820
You've been with these guys for what,
two years?

762
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:12,420
I've been here for six days.

763
00:54:13,830 --> 00:54:14,960
You're gambling, Bob.

764
00:54:15,030 --> 00:54:16,860
So what? Soldiers do that.

765
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:18,840
I don't deserve a reprimand for it.

766
00:54:19,310 --> 00:54:20,900
What if you'd won?

767
00:54:22,540 --> 00:54:25,700
What? What if you'd won?

768
00:54:30,820 --> 00:54:34,440
Never put yourself in a position
where you can take from these men.

769
00:54:39,990 --> 00:54:41,020
Lieutenant Meehan?

770
00:54:41,090 --> 00:54:42,120
Enter.

771
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:48,000
On the last training jump, I had a compass.

772
00:54:49,370 --> 00:54:50,990
Close the flap.

773
00:54:53,210 --> 00:54:54,170
Then we turn left.

774
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:55,230
Yeah.

775
00:54:55,310 --> 00:54:58,070
Bearing zero-four-two.

776
00:54:58,240 --> 00:54:59,340
12 minutes.

777
00:54:59,410 --> 00:55:00,940
Then another left?

778
00:55:02,250 --> 00:55:04,610
Call it three-five-eight...

779
00:55:05,890 --> 00:55:07,510
...for 10 and a half minutes.

780
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:10,880
Green light, right over Ramsbury.

781
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:12,010
Ramsbury.

782
00:55:12,090 --> 00:55:13,720
Every single time.

783
00:55:14,630 --> 00:55:18,080
Linear distance on the grid of about...

784
00:55:20,870 --> 00:55:21,730
Okay.

785
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:22,820
Ramsbury.

786
00:55:24,370 --> 00:55:25,560
Upottery.

787
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:34,300
So...

788
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:36,810
It's Normandy.

789
00:55:38,020 --> 00:55:39,210
St. Marie du Mont.

790
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:40,840
Causeway Number One.

791
00:55:40,990 --> 00:55:42,610
Causeway Number Two.

792
00:55:42,690 --> 00:55:44,350
The ultimate field problem.

793
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:48,750
The estuary of the Douve River
divides two beachheads...

794
00:55:48,830 --> 00:55:52,420
...code-named Utah, here, and Omaha, here.

795
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:55,790
Seaborne Infantry
will hit these beaches in force...

796
00:55:55,870 --> 00:55:58,060
...at a date and time to be specified.

797
00:55:58,470 --> 00:56:00,630
H-hour, D-day.

798
00:56:00,770 --> 00:56:05,070
Airborne's objective, gentlemen,
is to take the town of Carentan...

799
00:56:05,140 --> 00:56:09,010
...thus linking Utah and Omaha
into a single, continuous beachhead.

800
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:12,520
...linking Omaha and Utah
into one continuous beachhead.

801
00:56:13,180 --> 00:56:16,050
Each trooper will learn
this operation by heart...

802
00:56:16,150 --> 00:56:19,590
...and know his and every other outfits'
mission to the detail.

803
00:56:19,660 --> 00:56:20,420
Meehan?

804
00:56:20,490 --> 00:56:21,690
Yes, Dukeman.

805
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:23,060
Sir, are we dropping tonight?

806
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:25,120
When it's time for you to know,
we'll let you know.

807
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:29,760
In the meantime, study these sand tables,
maps, and reconnaissance photos...

808
00:56:29,830 --> 00:56:32,560
...until you can draw
a map of the area by memory.

809
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:39,510
Now, we will drop behind this Atlantic wall
five hours before the 4th Infantry lands at Utah.

810
00:56:39,610 --> 00:56:42,880
And between our assembly area
and the battalion's objective...

811
00:56:42,950 --> 00:56:47,250
...there is a German garrison right here
in this area, St. Marie du Mont.

812
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:50,820
Easy Company will destroy that garrison.

813
00:56:53,290 --> 00:56:56,920
Three-day supply of K rations,
chocolate bars, charms, candy...

814
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,990
...powdered coffee, sugar, and matches.

815
00:56:59,060 --> 00:57:03,020
Compass, bayonet, entrenching tool,
ammunition, gas mask.

816
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:07,500
Musette bag with ammo, my webbing,
my.45, canteen...

817
00:57:07,570 --> 00:57:09,000
...two cartons of smokes.

818
00:57:09,070 --> 00:57:12,060
Hawkins mine, two grenades,
smoke grenade, gamma grenade...

819
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:15,740
...TNT, this bullshit,
and a pair of nasty skivvies.

820
00:57:15,810 --> 00:57:16,900
What's your point?

821
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:18,350
This weighs as much as I do.

822
00:57:18,420 --> 00:57:21,480
I've still got my chute, my reserve chute,
my Mae West, my M-1.

823
00:57:21,550 --> 00:57:23,750
Where are you keeping your brass knuckles?

824
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:26,190
I could use some brass knuckles.

825
00:57:26,990 --> 00:57:28,360
Hey, anything for me?

826
00:57:28,430 --> 00:57:28,430
No.

827
00:57:28,430 --> 00:57:31,720
Sergeant Martin.

828
00:57:38,470 --> 00:57:40,200
For Talbert.

829
00:57:44,470 --> 00:57:45,530
Heavy! Condoms?

830
00:57:45,610 --> 00:57:46,970
I don't know, probably.

831
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:47,870
What you got?

832
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:50,540
"Dear Floyd: Give them hell."

833
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:52,810
It's from the chief of the Kokomo Police.

834
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:53,940
Right.

835
00:57:57,790 --> 00:57:59,620
You've got to love cops.

836
00:57:59,820 --> 00:58:01,880
All right, listen up, listen up.

837
00:58:02,590 --> 00:58:06,620
If you did not sign your GI life insurance policy...

838
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:11,370
...you go on over and see Sergeant Evans
at the headquarters company tent.

839
00:58:12,570 --> 00:58:16,000
You boys don't let your families
miss out on $10,000.

840
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:18,170
You hear that, Gerry?

841
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:19,040
Hey, Lip?

842
00:58:19,110 --> 00:58:20,080
Yeah, boy.

843
00:58:23,050 --> 00:58:25,170
Has Guarnere said anything about his brother?

844
00:58:25,250 --> 00:58:26,210
No.

845
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:27,440
I got a problem.

846
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:31,450
My wife keeps up with things back home,
casualty lists and like that.

847
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:32,540
Yeah?

848
00:58:32,860 --> 00:58:34,450
Guarnere's brother in Italy?

849
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:35,720
Henry?

850
00:58:35,990 --> 00:58:37,460
Killed in Monte Cassino.

851
00:58:39,430 --> 00:58:41,020
Well, I'm sure he doesn't know.

852
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:41,930
Damn.

853
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,660
What'd you think I should do?

854
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,200
If it were me, I'd tell him.

855
00:58:47,870 --> 00:58:49,860
Couple of hours before we jump?

856
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:52,770
I don't know.

857
00:59:02,020 --> 00:59:04,510
Why are they springing these things on us now?

858
00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:08,280
It's just an extra 80 pounds
strapped to your leg.

859
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:11,920
Does anybody have any idea
how the hell this thing works?

860
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:14,790
Colonel Sink.

861
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:18,000
Colonel Sink.

862
00:59:20,540 --> 00:59:22,440
"Soldiers of the regiment.

863
00:59:22,810 --> 00:59:27,870
"Tonight is the night of nights.

864
00:59:28,750 --> 00:59:30,940
"Today, as you read this...

865
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:34,880
"...you are en route to the great adventure
for which you have trained...

866
00:59:34,950 --> 00:59:37,010
"...for over two years."

867
00:59:37,290 --> 00:59:39,310
So, that's why they gave us ice cream.

868
00:59:42,190 --> 00:59:44,560
Easy Company, listen up!

869
00:59:47,060 --> 00:59:49,760
Channel coast is socked in with rain and fog.

870
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:52,430
No jump tonight.

871
00:59:53,100 --> 00:59:55,190
The invasion has been postponed.

872
00:59:55,540 --> 00:59:57,700
We're on a 24-hour stand-down.

873
01:00:01,910 --> 01:00:03,670
Well, this is quite a surprise.

874
01:00:03,750 --> 01:00:04,940
Not particularly.

875
01:00:05,010 --> 01:00:07,040
It so happens I rather expected it.

876
01:00:07,550 --> 01:00:13,350
Well, I can't see how you people
can pass up $80,000 for the Cause.

877
01:00:13,420 --> 01:00:14,580
For whose cause?

878
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:17,480
If you're so interested in serving a cause...

879
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:18,890
...why don't you join the Army?

880
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:20,450
Next, please.

881
01:00:24,630 --> 01:00:25,600
Oh, 4F.

882
01:00:25,670 --> 01:00:27,070
You look 1A to me.

883
01:00:27,140 --> 01:00:29,070
You don't look so bad yourself.

884
01:00:30,610 --> 01:00:32,100
"Dearest Johnny"?

885
01:00:33,210 --> 01:00:34,970
Well, should you be giving blood?

886
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:36,240
I woke up.

887
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:40,210
I got the wrong goddamn jacket.

888
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:42,910
I was struck by lightning.

889
01:00:50,660 --> 01:00:51,820
Nobody dancing.

890
01:00:52,530 --> 01:00:54,050
It doesn't matter.

891
01:00:54,860 --> 01:00:57,420
"Your pal, Bill Guarnere's brother..."

892
01:02:30,460 --> 01:02:31,720
Good luck, lads.

893
01:02:31,990 --> 01:02:33,120
See you, tommies.

894
01:02:33,700 --> 01:02:35,460
See you, mate.

895
01:02:48,210 --> 01:02:50,400
Try and get these leg straps through.

896
01:02:55,150 --> 01:02:56,640
Johnny?

897
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:04,920
Got something you might be looking for.

898
01:03:05,460 --> 01:03:07,290
Took your jacket by mistake.

899
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:08,560
I'm sorry.

900
01:03:08,630 --> 01:03:10,030
You read it?

901
01:03:12,170 --> 01:03:13,960
Where the fuck is Monte Cassino?

902
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:16,000
I don't know. Italy somewhere.

903
01:03:19,870 --> 01:03:22,170
Sorry about your brother, Bill.

904
01:03:22,780 --> 01:03:24,470
I'm sorry for my ma.

905
01:03:25,410 --> 01:03:27,110
He was...

906
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:33,080
Let's get this over with.

907
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:38,590
Bill?

908
01:03:41,330 --> 01:03:43,260
I'll meet up with you over there.

909
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:50,540
Gentlemen, Doc Roe is handing
these out for air sickness.

910
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:54,470
Orders are, "Every man takes one now,
another, 30 minutes in the air."

911
01:03:56,280 --> 01:03:57,370
Lieutenant.

912
01:04:04,250 --> 01:04:05,680
2nd Platoon, listen up.

913
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:10,650
Good luck.

914
01:04:12,260 --> 01:04:13,850
God bless you.

915
01:04:15,630 --> 01:04:17,530
I'll see you in the assembly area.

916
01:05:12,550 --> 01:05:16,750
If the wire contacts are sensitive,
then I think all we should have to do...

917
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:23,620
Goddamn, Lieb.

918
01:05:23,700 --> 01:05:25,690
That airsick pill is making me loopy.

919
01:05:26,305 --> 01:06:26,340
