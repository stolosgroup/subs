1
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:15,548
I've seen death. I've seen my friends,
my men, being killed.

2
00:00:15,549 --> 00:00:22,179
And this is... It doesn't take
too many days of that...

3
5
00:00:29,438 --> 00:00:34,734
We didn't have clothes. If you built
a fire, something would shoot at you.

4
00:00:34,735 --> 00:00:38,446
Everywhere you look,
you would see dead people.

5
00:00:38,447 --> 00:00:41,783
A dead soldier there, here.
Ours, theirs.

6
00:00:41,784 --> 00:00:47,120
Then civilians, besides...
Dead animals.

7
00:00:47,122 --> 00:00:49,665
So death was all over.

8
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:55,171
You don't have a chance,
when your friends go down...

9
00:00:55,172 --> 00:01:00,051
...to really take care of them
as you might.

10
00:01:00,052 --> 00:01:06,422
And especially if you're under attack,
moving or whatever, and...

11
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:11,062
I withstood it well...

12
00:01:11,063 --> 00:01:16,818
...but I had a lot of trouble
in later life...

13
00:01:16,819 --> 00:01:22,824
...because those events
would come back...

14
00:01:22,825 --> 00:01:26,556
...and you never forget them.

15

16
00:04:10,242 --> 00:04:12,034
After Bastogne...

17
00:04:12,035 --> 00:04:16,706
...Easy Company was called
to push the Germans through the Bulge.

18
00:04:16,707 --> 00:04:20,209
We were here this morning.
We came this way.

19
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:23,713
Here's the logging road
coming into here.

20
00:04:23,714 --> 00:04:26,507
- So you go right there.
- Take it easy!

21
00:04:26,508 --> 00:04:30,928
- Stop crying or I'll nail it to your head.
- It's made of wood.

22
00:04:30,929 --> 00:04:34,890
- Move them out.
- Yes, sir. 2nd Platoon, let's go.

23
00:04:34,891 --> 00:04:40,479
I was glad to be out of my foxhole
and moving, even if only to get warm.

24
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,495
Spread out. Keep your interval.

25
00:04:50,365 --> 00:04:54,827
E Company was sent to clear
the woods near the town of Foy...

26
00:04:54,828 --> 00:04:59,749
...in preparation for what we knew
would be the assault on Foy itself.

27
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,042
I see it, Buck.

28
00:05:01,043 --> 00:05:04,137
Watch for mines.

29
00:05:05,547 --> 00:05:10,718
During that 1000-yard attack, we
encountered sporadic machine-gun fire...

30
00:05:10,719 --> 00:05:15,929
...and had a couple casualties,
but overall met little resistance.

31
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:23,223
Nelson! Look. Nelson!

32
00:05:24,358 --> 00:05:30,455
Hoobler's run-in with the German was
the most dramatic moment of the day.

33
00:05:38,372 --> 00:05:39,941
Halt!

34
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:43,960
Halt!

35
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:09,690
Oh, shit.

36
00:06:21,498 --> 00:06:23,556
Thank you.

37
00:06:28,505 --> 00:06:33,008
Hoobler had been talking
about getting a Luger since Normandy.

38
00:06:33,009 --> 00:06:36,554
He went from foxhole to foxhole
telling everyone.

39
00:06:36,555 --> 00:06:39,348
Down he goes like a sack of potatoes.

40
00:06:39,349 --> 00:06:43,519
Outstanding accuracy on my part,
if I do say so myself.

41
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,188
- Which you do.
- Which I do.

42
00:06:46,189 --> 00:06:49,734
Shifty, I could've given you
a run for your money.

43
00:06:49,735 --> 00:06:53,904
No, I'm not a good shot.
Dad was an excellent shot.

44
00:06:53,905 --> 00:06:56,282
He'd shoot the wings off a fly.

45
00:06:56,283 --> 00:06:59,452
That German,
what'd you think he was doing?

46
00:06:59,453 --> 00:07:03,581
Recon. He must have figured
nobody'd hear a horse.

47
00:07:03,582 --> 00:07:06,542
He was just trying
to get out of Dodge.

48
00:07:06,543 --> 00:07:09,503
- What happened to the horse?
- Don't know.

49
00:07:09,504 --> 00:07:12,438
Probably still running.
Hope he's okay.

50
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:15,885
- You dug in?
- Yeah, yeah.

51
00:07:15,886 --> 00:07:18,929
Just thought I'd take a walk.

52
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:21,766
You're a good shot.
Glad you're on our side.

53
00:07:21,767 --> 00:07:23,851
Thanks, Lip.

54
00:07:23,852 --> 00:07:25,978
- Hey, Lip?
- Yeah.

55
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:30,107
- Thanks for the help.
- You got it, Shifty.

56
00:07:30,108 --> 00:07:35,045
- Hey, Lip? You got a sec?
- Yes, sir.

57
00:07:36,907 --> 00:07:39,602
Give him a hand.

58
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:43,579
- Where's Dike?
- He's around.

59
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:47,708
- Could you be more specific, sergeant?
- Not really, sir.

60
00:07:47,709 --> 00:07:53,005
I haven't seen him all day and I have
to figure out how we ended up.

61
00:07:53,006 --> 00:07:55,841
- Two wounded.
- Who?

62
00:07:55,842 --> 00:08:00,054
- Brown and Stevenson.
- Goddamn it. Where's Dike?

63
00:08:00,055 --> 00:08:02,139
Where does he go?

64
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:06,060
I don't know,
but I wish he'd stay there.

65
00:08:06,061 --> 00:08:09,678
- Shut up, boys.
- Shutting up, sarge.

66
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:12,067
What the hell was that?

67
00:08:13,068 --> 00:08:17,405
- Patrol?
- No, we would've heard.

68
00:08:17,406 --> 00:08:20,700
- One man, maybe a sniper.
- That was no rifle.

69
00:08:20,701 --> 00:08:23,994
- What do you see, Shift?
- Nobody out there.

70
00:08:23,995 --> 00:08:26,038
- Are you sure?
- Uh-huh.

71
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:28,999
- It's Hoob. He's shot!
- Sniper?

72
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,671
- No, no, he, he shot himself.
- Medic!

73
00:08:33,672 --> 00:08:35,673
- What happened?
- Doc.

74
00:08:35,674 --> 00:08:37,299
It's my fucking leg.

75
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:41,303
- You'll be all right.
- It just went off.

76
00:08:41,304 --> 00:08:46,851
What are you doing with a loaded gun
in your pants? Damn it! Goddamn it!

77
00:08:46,852 --> 00:08:49,145
- I wasn't touching it.
- Medic!

78
00:08:49,146 --> 00:08:52,982
- Where are you hit?
- In my leg.

79
00:08:52,983 --> 00:08:57,737
- Take it easy, buddy.
- Don't look, Hoob. It'll be fine.

80
00:08:57,738 --> 00:09:01,407
- Hurts like a son of a bitch.
- It's gonna be okay.

81
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:04,493
- Doc!
- Don't worry about it, Hoob.

82
00:09:04,494 --> 00:09:08,664
- You'll be all right. You hear me?
- Warm him up!

83
00:09:08,665 --> 00:09:10,374
Keep him warm.

84
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:14,670
- How's it looking, doc?
- Let me see it.

85
00:09:14,671 --> 00:09:18,883
Can we get him some blankets
or something?

86
00:09:18,884 --> 00:09:22,261
- Keep talking to him.
- Listen to me, it's okay.

87
00:09:22,262 --> 00:09:24,638
Think it was a German leg?

88
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:28,267
- It's not that bad.
- You're gonna be fine.

89
00:09:28,268 --> 00:09:31,312
Hold on. Put this across him.

90
00:09:31,313 --> 00:09:35,983
- Wrap him up. Wrap him up.
- Here you go. Here you go.

91
00:09:35,984 --> 00:09:42,195
- Lip, you said I was a great shot?
- You are. You're a great shot.

92
00:09:42,199 --> 00:09:45,576
You jump out of planes.
You're tough, man.

93
00:09:45,577 --> 00:09:48,579
- It's not that bad.
- Stay with us, Hoob.

94
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:51,832
- It's all right.
- Doc, what are we gonna do?

95
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:55,544
- How we doing, doc?
- I can't see a thing.

96
00:09:55,545 --> 00:10:01,836
- Let's get ready to move him.
- Relax, take it easy. Take it easy.

97
00:10:01,843 --> 00:10:04,732
Doc. Doc!

98
00:10:16,608 --> 00:10:19,099
Perc, I'll need a jeep.

99
00:10:24,491 --> 00:10:29,745
He was wearing so many clothes we
couldn't tell how bad he was bleeding.

100
00:10:29,746 --> 00:10:35,251
He was already dead. The bullet
cut the main artery in his leg.

101
00:10:35,252 --> 00:10:39,922
It wouldn't have made a difference
if you had known.

102
00:10:39,923 --> 00:10:43,592
Cut that main artery
in the leg, that's it.

103
00:10:43,593 --> 00:10:50,441
Yes, sir. I'm gonna go back and make
sure the boys are all dug in, sir.

104
00:10:50,475 --> 00:10:56,313
- Lip? Where's Dike?
- You want to see him, sir?

105
00:10:56,314 --> 00:11:00,818
No, I just would have expected
this kind of news from him.

106
00:11:00,819 --> 00:11:05,915
Well, I was there, sir.
Figured it might as well be me.

107
00:11:17,878 --> 00:11:22,631
Where's Dike? I probably heard
that question a thousand times...

108
00:11:22,632 --> 00:11:25,843
...and I probably asked it
a few times myself.

109
00:11:25,844 --> 00:11:31,057
There were long stretches where we
didn 't know where Lieutenant Dike was.

110
00:11:31,058 --> 00:11:33,559
He'd disappear for hours.

111
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:37,396
It wouldn 't have been bad
if he was one of the guys...

112
00:11:37,397 --> 00:11:41,685
...but he was supposed to be
leading the company.

113
00:11:41,735 --> 00:11:45,654
Captain Winters was a CO
we could all respect.

114
00:11:45,655 --> 00:11:48,908
Moose Heyliger would have done
a good job...

115
00:11:48,909 --> 00:11:52,745
...but he was accidentally shot
by a sentry.

116
00:11:52,746 --> 00:11:54,872
Then came Norman Dike.

117
00:11:54,873 --> 00:11:58,918
I want security around the company CP.

118
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:02,338
Dike wasn 't bad
because he made bad decisions...

119
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:05,633
...he was bad
because he made no decisions.

120
00:12:05,634 --> 00:12:09,553
Battalion S3 is planning a move...

121
00:12:09,554 --> 00:12:13,766
...so I will probably
be called away regularly.

122
00:12:13,767 --> 00:12:15,559
Any questions?

123
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:21,180
Yeah. What's the formation
you're wanting us to go for?

124
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:27,488
At present, as per usual, but I'll
clarify that with you at a later time.

125
00:12:27,489 --> 00:12:29,820
Yes, sir.

126
00:12:31,993 --> 00:12:35,212
I gotta make a call.

127
00:12:42,212 --> 00:12:45,624
- Let's move it out.
- Right.

128
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,887
Dike was a favorite
of somebody at Division.

129
00:12:51,888 --> 00:12:55,599
He'd been sent down
to get combat experience.

130
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,186
It seemed like E Company
was an annoyance to him.

131
00:12:59,187 --> 00:13:04,275
Something he had to get through
before he could continue up the ladder.

132
00:13:04,276 --> 00:13:08,571
- We're screwed.
- I'm glad Dike's never around.

133
00:13:08,572 --> 00:13:13,492
You know what? We're doing all right,
even with Foxhole Norman.

134
00:13:13,493 --> 00:13:17,246
We're doing all right now.
In case you ain't noticed...

135
00:13:17,247 --> 00:13:21,751
...there's a town over there, right?
In that town are Germans.

136
00:13:21,752 --> 00:13:24,211
- These Germans got tanks.
- I know.

137
00:13:24,212 --> 00:13:27,548
And our side's gonna want
to go into that town.

138
00:13:27,549 --> 00:13:31,469
Guess who they're gonna want
to go knock on the door?

139
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:35,264
I know, all right? It's me you're
talking to here.

140
00:13:35,265 --> 00:13:41,145
We gotta do all this with a CO
who's got his head so far up his ass...

141
00:13:41,146 --> 00:13:44,774
...that lump in his throat
is his goddamn nose.

142
00:13:44,775 --> 00:13:47,860
- Hey, first sergeant.
- Hey, boys.

143
00:13:47,861 --> 00:13:51,238
- Hey, Lip.
- Hey, Muck, what's the word?

144
00:13:51,239 --> 00:13:57,769
Sitting around freezing our ass off,
singing Dike's praises.

145
00:13:57,788 --> 00:14:01,758
Oh, yeah. Lieutenant Dike.

146
00:14:02,626 --> 00:14:06,587
Well, I'll tell you...

147
00:14:06,588 --> 00:14:10,216
...I wouldn't want to be
a replacement officer here.

148
00:14:10,217 --> 00:14:15,871
Get thrown in with guys who've
known each other for what, two years?

149
00:14:16,473 --> 00:14:19,975
You've been in combat together
since Normandy.

150
00:14:19,976 --> 00:14:26,233
He's supposed to just show up
and lead them? How does a guy do that?

151
00:14:26,233 --> 00:14:31,404
How could anyone really hope
to gain respect of the toughest...

152
00:14:31,405 --> 00:14:37,868
...most professional, most dedicated
sons of bitches in the entire ETO?

153
00:14:37,869 --> 00:14:42,832
If you ask me, a guy'd have
to march off to Berlin...

154
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:47,645
...and come back
with Hitler's mustache or something.

155
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:55,886
Anyway, listen. You guys don't worry
about Dike. All right?

156
00:14:55,887 --> 00:14:57,471
Yeah.

157
00:14:57,472 --> 00:15:01,567
We all do our jobs,
everything'll be fine.

158
00:15:05,439 --> 00:15:08,407
- See you, sarge.
- Yeah, boy.

159
00:15:09,026 --> 00:15:13,988
I don 't know if I believed that,
but as first sergeant, it was my job.

160
00:15:13,989 --> 00:15:18,868
Not to protect Dike, but to protect
the integrity of the company.

161
00:15:18,869 --> 00:15:22,079
You know what Dike's problem is,
don't you?

162
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:25,291
He's another arrogant, rich jerk
from Yale.

163
00:15:25,292 --> 00:15:29,307
Oh, God, not another one of those.

164
00:15:31,339 --> 00:15:36,177
Division wouldn't let me replace him
just because I got a bad feeling.

165
00:15:36,178 --> 00:15:39,954
Even if they would,
who'd I put in his place?

166
00:15:40,557 --> 00:15:41,849
Shames?

167
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:43,976
Do not talk when I'm talking!

168
00:15:43,977 --> 00:15:47,063
Shames has seen too many war movies.

169
00:15:47,064 --> 00:15:51,443
You crapheads did not listen
to a word I said, did you?

170
00:15:52,194 --> 00:15:53,486
Or Peacock?

171
00:15:53,487 --> 00:15:58,032
He tries hard, but he's not cut out
to take men into combat.

172
00:15:58,033 --> 00:16:03,329
I'm not making him Company CO when
I don 't want him as a platoon leader.

173
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:07,948
- What about Compton?
- He's the only real choice.

174
00:16:08,752 --> 00:16:12,289
Buck's a real combat leader,
but you know...

175
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:17,802
...I want Easy to have
at least one experienced platoon leader.

176
00:16:17,803 --> 00:16:22,216
Not that it matters anyway,
because I can't get rid of Dike.

177
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:28,229
We all know who you'd like
to have running Easy.

178
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:31,649
Trouble is,
it's not your job anymore, Dick.

179
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:35,301
You've gotta find somebody.

180
00:16:41,368 --> 00:16:44,745
We agreed Buck would've been
the best choice...

181
00:16:44,746 --> 00:16:48,443
...if Winters had been able to
get rid of Dike.

182
00:16:49,668 --> 00:16:54,296
But Buck wasn 't the same
as before he got shot in Holland.

183
00:16:54,297 --> 00:16:56,048
He was more serious.

184
00:16:56,049 --> 00:16:59,510
- He had a Luger in his pants.
- Jesus.

185
00:16:59,511 --> 00:17:04,014
Don't you two do something
stupid like that, all right?

186
00:17:04,015 --> 00:17:07,184
- We'll try not to, Buck.
- I mean it.

187
00:17:07,185 --> 00:17:10,104
And you, Wild Bill.

188
00:17:10,105 --> 00:17:15,901
I've invested too much goddamn time
shaping you into something useful.

189
00:17:15,902 --> 00:17:20,489
- You do something crazy...
- I know, you'll kill me.

190
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:24,027
Even if you're dead,
I'll still kill you.

191
00:17:24,578 --> 00:17:28,787
I'll see you later.
I'm gonna check on the other guys.

192
00:17:33,128 --> 00:17:37,006
- Crazy Joe McCloskey.
- What?

193
00:17:37,007 --> 00:17:41,469
This guy used to hang out at Delancey's
and stare at people.

194
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:47,391
I know who Crazy Joe is.
What's that got to do with anything?

195
00:17:47,392 --> 00:17:50,247
Buck kind of reminds me of him now.

196
00:17:50,771 --> 00:17:55,316
- What?
- Ever since he got shot in Holland.

197
00:17:55,317 --> 00:18:01,280
Wait. What are you saying, he's nuts?
Because Crazy Joe was nuts.

198
00:18:01,281 --> 00:18:04,492
I'm not saying he's nuts.
I'm just saying...

199
00:18:04,493 --> 00:18:06,952
What? What are you saying?

200
00:18:06,953 --> 00:18:08,788
- Forget it.
- What?

201
00:18:08,789 --> 00:18:12,041
Forget it.
Come on, you've seen him, Bill.

202
00:18:12,042 --> 00:18:17,536
- He's all wound up like a spring.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's fine.

203
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:24,261
It wasn't getting shot that got him,
it was that hospital.

204
00:18:24,262 --> 00:18:29,767
- I've been there, okay? It ain't pretty.
- Yeah.

205
00:18:29,768 --> 00:18:34,307
Besides, once he was up and around,
he was his old self again.

206
00:18:35,148 --> 00:18:39,004
I'm telling you, Buck Compton's fine.

207
00:18:40,821 --> 00:18:43,447
- I'm serious.
- Sure. Nothing stupid.

208
00:18:43,448 --> 00:18:46,701
- We got it, right?
- We got it.

209
00:18:46,702 --> 00:18:49,477
All right. George?

210
00:18:51,748 --> 00:18:54,557
Nothing stupid, Buck.

211
00:19:01,425 --> 00:19:03,801
Who is he talking to?

212
00:19:03,802 --> 00:19:09,348
Morons who volunteered to jump out of a
good airplane. Can you get more stupid?

213
00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:11,851
- Probably not.
- Right.

214
00:19:11,852 --> 00:19:15,822
- I swum across the Niagara once.
- Yeah.

215
00:19:17,399 --> 00:19:22,611
- I swear. On a bet.
- What, in a barrel?

216
00:19:22,612 --> 00:19:26,824
No. I didn't go over the falls.
I swam across the river.

217
00:19:26,825 --> 00:19:29,660
- I don't know.
- Ten miles up.

218
00:19:29,661 --> 00:19:32,329
- That current is damn strong.
- Yeah.

219
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:37,418
Must have carried me two miles
downstream, but I got across.

220
00:19:37,419 --> 00:19:41,589
Now, personally, I didn't think
it was all that stupid...

221
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:46,385
...but my mom, my sister Ruth,
they gave me all kinds of hell.

222
00:19:46,386 --> 00:19:49,722
- Yeah, I bet, Muck.
- So did Faye.

223
00:19:49,723 --> 00:19:53,476
- Sweet Faye Tanner.
- Shut it, George.

224
00:19:53,477 --> 00:19:57,447
They had a point. You're an idiot.

225
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,732
I heard about Hoobler. Shame.

226
00:20:22,047 --> 00:20:25,664
Yes, sir. It is.

227
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:29,303
- Is that the Luger?
- Yes, it is.

228
00:20:29,304 --> 00:20:33,843
- What are you gonna do with it?
- I don't know yet.

229
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:41,148
- Where you from? Where'd you grow up?
- Huntington, West Virginia.

230
00:20:41,149 --> 00:20:44,026
- Huntington?
- Yes, sir.

231
00:20:44,027 --> 00:20:46,946
I don't know it.

232
00:20:46,947 --> 00:20:50,449
What kind of work did you do there?

233
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:54,412
My brother and I helped my mom
run a boarding house.

234
00:20:54,413 --> 00:20:56,983
And your father?

235
00:20:59,042 --> 00:21:05,651
He was killed when I was 10, sir.
Automobile accident.

236
00:21:07,092 --> 00:21:09,230
That's sad.

237
00:21:14,057 --> 00:21:16,851
Why'd you decide
to join the paratroopers?

238
00:21:16,852 --> 00:21:20,771
I read an article about paratroopers
in Life.

239
00:21:20,772 --> 00:21:24,108
Talked about the training,
how hard it was.

240
00:21:24,109 --> 00:21:28,738
It said if you wanted to make it,
you had to be the best.

241
00:21:28,739 --> 00:21:31,699
And I wanted to fight
with the best, sir.

242
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,368
You miss it?

243
00:21:34,369 --> 00:21:37,542
- Miss what?
- Huntington.

244
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:45,460
Honestly, sir, I try not to think
about it that much.

245
00:21:47,841 --> 00:21:50,172
Where are you from, s?

246
00:22:09,404 --> 00:22:13,897
- Captain Nixon, sir? Captain Nixon?
- What?

247
00:22:14,368 --> 00:22:18,463
Sorry to disturb you.
This came from Division.

248
00:22:21,291 --> 00:22:23,110
All right.

249
00:22:26,546 --> 00:22:29,757
- Morning.
- Eviction notice?

250
00:22:29,758 --> 00:22:33,427
Something that'll help
your leadership problem.

251
00:22:33,428 --> 00:22:36,972
- Dike's transferred?
- I can't help with that.

252
00:22:36,973 --> 00:22:41,394
Division has decided to pluck
one officer from each regiment...

253
00:22:41,395 --> 00:22:46,273
...that served in Bastogne, send him
to the States on a 30-day furlough...

254
00:22:46,274 --> 00:22:49,944
...get him banging the drum
for the war bond drive.

255
00:22:49,945 --> 00:22:53,118
Turns out I've been plucked.

256
00:22:55,283 --> 00:22:59,286
- That's fantastic, Lew. Good for you.
- Thank you.

257
00:22:59,287 --> 00:23:02,373
- How does your leaving help?
- I'm not going.

258
00:23:02,374 --> 00:23:06,252
I've seen the States.
That's why I came to Europe.

259
00:23:06,253 --> 00:23:11,382
Wish they'd told me there was a war.
Anyway, this thing's wasted on me.

260
00:23:11,383 --> 00:23:16,274
But I'm sure we could find an officer
who could use a trip home.

261
00:23:17,222 --> 00:23:21,392
Peacock, I can't think of anybody
who deserves this more.

262
00:23:21,393 --> 00:23:23,406
Thanks.

263
00:23:24,312 --> 00:23:29,275
- Really glad that you're going home.
- Best news I've heard in weeks.

264
00:23:29,276 --> 00:23:30,901
Hell of a guy.

265
00:23:30,902 --> 00:23:34,363
Thanks, guys.
It really means a lot, you know?

266
00:23:34,364 --> 00:23:38,242
Get out of here.
Three cheers for Lt. Peacock.

267
00:23:38,243 --> 00:23:42,782
Hip, hip, hooray. Hip, hip, hooray.
Hip, hip, hooray.

268
00:23:55,385 --> 00:23:58,262
If they come here,
smile for the camera.

269
00:23:58,263 --> 00:24:01,349
Got to keep morale up
for folks back home.

270
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:05,311
- Why?
- Damned if I know.

271
00:24:05,312 --> 00:24:08,105
What's waiting for us in Foy?

272
00:24:08,106 --> 00:24:12,234
At least one company
from the 10th Panzer Grenadiers.

273
00:24:12,235 --> 00:24:16,864
They've got one 88, although
we haven't been able to spot it.

274
00:24:16,865 --> 00:24:20,034
- Armor?
- As of last night, three Tigers.

275
00:24:20,035 --> 00:24:23,037
- Would you excuse me a moment, sir?
- Yeah.

276
00:24:23,038 --> 00:24:26,499
How do I feel
about being rescued by Patton?

277
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:30,461
Well, I'd feel peachy
if it wasn't for one thing.

278
00:24:30,462 --> 00:24:35,007
We didn't need to be fucking rescued
by Patton. You got that?

279
00:24:35,008 --> 00:24:36,342
- Joe.
- Sir.

280
00:24:36,343 --> 00:24:38,636
Excuse us for a moment.

281
00:24:38,637 --> 00:24:39,929
Sorry, sir.

282
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:44,225
Sorry about what? Patton?
I couldn't agree more.

283
00:24:44,226 --> 00:24:47,770
- What are you doing?
- I want to head back.

284
00:24:47,771 --> 00:24:51,816
You don't have to.
Get back to the aid station.

285
00:24:51,817 --> 00:24:55,707
I'd really like to head back
with the fellas, sir.

286
00:24:57,531 --> 00:25:02,547
- All right, then go.
- Thank you, sir.

287
00:25:06,415 --> 00:25:09,959
Joe had been at the aid station
for three days...

288
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:14,547
...and everybody was glad
to have him back. Especially Bill.

289
00:25:14,548 --> 00:25:16,215
- Hey, Joe.
- Hey, Bill.

290
00:25:16,216 --> 00:25:21,053
- What you doing back here?
- Making sure you're on top of things.

291
00:25:21,054 --> 00:25:26,684
I'm on top of things. Tied me own boots
once last week. All by meself.

292
00:25:26,685 --> 00:25:31,188
- Look who I found.
- Joe Toye, back for more.

293
00:25:31,189 --> 00:25:32,648
How are you, Joe?

294
00:25:32,649 --> 00:25:36,777
- Good. Escaped from the aid station.
- Where'd you get hit?

295
00:25:36,778 --> 00:25:39,864
- What's that?
- It's Webb. Replacement.

296
00:25:39,865 --> 00:25:44,452
Thought it was some guy I've known
for years and forgot.

297
00:25:44,453 --> 00:25:48,456
Joe got hit in the arm.
Gift from the Luftwaffe.

298
00:25:48,457 --> 00:25:51,876
- Lot of you been injured?
- It's called wounded.

299
00:25:51,877 --> 00:25:54,712
Injured is when you fall out
of a tree.

300
00:25:54,713 --> 00:25:59,175
There's enough crap flying around,
you're bound to get dinged.

301
00:25:59,176 --> 00:26:03,054
Almost every one of these guys
have been hit once.

302
00:26:03,055 --> 00:26:07,725
Except Alley. He's a two-timer.
He landed on broken glass...

303
00:26:07,726 --> 00:26:10,728
...and got peppered
by a potato masher.

304
00:26:10,729 --> 00:26:14,398
Bull got a piece
of exploding tank in Holland.

305
00:26:14,399 --> 00:26:19,278
And George Luz here has never been hit.
You're one lucky bastard.

306
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:22,948
- Takes one to know one.
- Consider us blessed.

307
00:26:22,949 --> 00:26:27,203
Liebgott got pinked
in the neck in Holland.

308
00:26:27,204 --> 00:26:30,039
Next to him, that's Popeye.

309
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:34,168
He got shot in his scrawny
little butt in Normandy.

310
00:26:34,169 --> 00:26:38,047
Buck got shot in his rather large butt
in Holland.

311
00:26:38,048 --> 00:26:42,134
Easy Company tradition,
getting shot in the ass.

312
00:26:42,135 --> 00:26:47,807
Even 1 st Sgt. Lipton, he got
a couple pieces of tank shell burst.

313
00:26:47,808 --> 00:26:52,687
One chunk in the face.
Another chunk almost took out his nuts.

314
00:26:52,688 --> 00:26:59,787
- How are those nuts, sarge?
- Doing fine, Bill. Nice of you to ask.

315
00:27:01,571 --> 00:27:07,743
On January 3rd, most of E Company
headed to our old position in the woods.

316
00:27:07,744 --> 00:27:12,954
A few men remained attached
to D Company to hold the line.

317
00:27:13,291 --> 00:27:15,747
Good luck, ladies.

318
00:27:16,461 --> 00:27:18,713
Been nice knowing you.

319
00:27:19,297 --> 00:27:23,968
- Wouldn't drink if I were you.
- Be careful if he offers a cigarette.

320
00:27:23,969 --> 00:27:26,345
If who offers us a cigarette?

321
00:27:26,346 --> 00:27:28,305
- Speirs.
- Who?

322
00:27:28,306 --> 00:27:31,195
Lieutenant Speirs.

323
00:27:32,644 --> 00:27:38,218
Lieutenant Ronald Speirs was one of the
platoon leaders. He was a legend.

324
00:27:38,817 --> 00:27:44,196
- The stories are all bullshit anyway.
- What stories?

325
00:27:44,197 --> 00:27:45,698
What stories?

326
00:27:45,699 --> 00:27:49,535
Supposedly Speirs shot one
of his men for being drunk.

327
00:27:49,536 --> 00:27:53,039
You're kidding! That's unbelievable.

328
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:57,793
There's another one about him
giving cigarettes to 20 POWs...

329
00:27:57,794 --> 00:28:01,589
...before killing them.
- He shot 20 POWs?

330
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:03,883
I heard it was 30.

331
00:28:03,884 --> 00:28:07,136
- Christenson.
- Lieutenant Speirs.

332
00:28:07,137 --> 00:28:10,868
- I got the name right, didn't I?
- Yes, sir.

333
00:28:11,975 --> 00:28:17,105
- What are you men doing out here?
- We're watching the line, sir.

334
00:28:18,482 --> 00:28:21,525
You might want
to reinforce your cover.

335
00:28:21,526 --> 00:28:23,944
Lieutenant Dike said not to.

336
00:28:23,945 --> 00:28:28,949
- That we're only gonna be here one day.
- Lieutenant Dike said that?

337
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:32,328
Then forget what I said.

338
00:28:33,413 --> 00:28:35,392
Carry on.

339
00:28:38,377 --> 00:28:41,789
Anyone care for a smoke?

340
00:28:45,467 --> 00:28:48,003
You?

341
00:28:49,012 --> 00:28:52,014
Late in the afternoon
on January 3rd...

342
00:28:52,015 --> 00:28:55,601
...we returned
to our old position in the woods.

343
00:28:55,602 --> 00:28:59,105
You gotta be fucking kidding me!

344
00:28:59,106 --> 00:29:02,191
Someone's gonna fucking die.

345
00:29:02,192 --> 00:29:07,405
Look at this shit! Those 1 st Battalion
fuckers took a dump in my foxhole.

346
00:29:07,406 --> 00:29:11,182
Think they shit
in everyone's foxhole, Joe.

347
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:16,369
I don't think they wanted
to spend much time aboveground.

348
00:29:17,916 --> 00:29:21,544
The Germans had been shelling
our old position.

349
00:29:21,545 --> 00:29:25,923
There were signs
of tree bursts everywhere.

350
00:29:25,924 --> 00:29:30,736
Light and noise discipline.
We're getting close.

351
00:29:39,229 --> 00:29:42,481
Across the field,
I could see enemy troops.

352
00:29:42,482 --> 00:29:47,817
I still couldn 't see their artillery,
but I knew it was down there.

353
00:29:49,656 --> 00:29:53,659
The Krauts have been
pounding this area with 88s.

354
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:59,373
- They got this whole stretch targeted.
- Maybe they've got a new target.

355
00:29:59,374 --> 00:30:01,834
- No, they're waiting.
- For what?

356
00:30:01,835 --> 00:30:06,005
- For us to reoccupy the position.
- We should fall back.

357
00:30:06,006 --> 00:30:11,594
It's our job to hold the line here.
We just need to fortify the covers.

358
00:30:11,595 --> 00:30:17,475
- If they've got us targeted, maybe...
- We hold the line here. Lipton's right.

359
00:30:17,476 --> 00:30:20,895
We're gonna strengthen our covers
and hang in.

360
00:30:20,896 --> 00:30:26,231
We're not gonna fall back.
Right, lieutenant?

361
00:30:27,986 --> 00:30:33,074
- Right, lieutenant?
- Fine. You all take care of it.

362
00:30:33,075 --> 00:30:36,169
I gotta go talk to Regiment.

363
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,572
- We better get moving.
- Yeah.

364
00:30:44,294 --> 00:30:46,587
- Here you go.
- Thanks, Lip.

365
00:30:46,588 --> 00:30:51,047
- I'll get you more branches.
- I appreciate that.

366
00:31:13,407 --> 00:31:17,183
Incoming! Take cover!

367
00:31:19,496 --> 00:31:21,315
Take cover!

368
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,836
They're 88s.

369
00:31:26,837 --> 00:31:29,088
Come on, find some cover!

370
00:31:29,089 --> 00:31:31,898
They've got us zeroed!

371
00:31:32,509 --> 00:31:36,846
Find some cover. Find a foxhole.
Come on, take cover!

372
00:31:36,847 --> 00:31:41,226
- Get in the holes.
- Take cover!

373
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:47,114
Come on, find some cover!

374
00:31:50,193 --> 00:31:52,649
Take cover!

375
00:31:53,447 --> 00:31:55,346
Shit.

376
00:32:04,082 --> 00:32:08,814
Come on, find some cover.
Find some cover!

377
00:32:16,261 --> 00:32:19,430
For some reason,
all I could think about...

378
00:32:19,431 --> 00:32:22,600
...was the Fourth of July
when I was a kid.

379
00:32:22,601 --> 00:32:27,396
I loved to make my own firecrackers,
cherry bombs, ladyfingers.

380
00:32:27,397 --> 00:32:33,361
I loved to blow up dirt clods and pop
bottles. Looked forward to it all year.

381
00:32:33,362 --> 00:32:39,732
That day, I saw the most awesome
display of firepower I'd ever seen.

382
00:32:39,743 --> 00:32:43,997
I wouldn 't have laughed
if I'd known what happened to Joe Toye.

383
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:47,893
- We should see if anybody's hit.
- That's what they want.

384
00:33:47,894 --> 00:33:51,466
Krauts will try to draw us
out in the open.

385
00:34:00,949 --> 00:34:06,537
Stay in your foxholes.
Stay in your foxholes!

386
00:34:06,538 --> 00:34:09,415
Can you walk? Find a foxhole.

387
00:34:09,416 --> 00:34:11,986
I gotta get up.

388
00:34:14,796 --> 00:34:17,412
I gotta get up.

389
00:34:19,092 --> 00:34:21,822
I gotta get up.

390
00:34:23,722 --> 00:34:26,531
I need my helmet.

391
00:34:27,059 --> 00:34:30,603
- I need help!
- You hear that?

392
00:34:30,604 --> 00:34:33,459
- I need help!
- Is that Joe?

393
00:34:34,983 --> 00:34:37,439
Yeah, I think that's Joe.

394
00:34:37,819 --> 00:34:40,613
Stay.

395
00:34:40,614 --> 00:34:45,826
- Stay down! Stay down!
- Stay down! Stay in your foxholes!

396
00:34:45,827 --> 00:34:49,997
- Stay in your foxholes!
- Help!

397
00:34:49,998 --> 00:34:55,127
- Help! Anyone there?
- Jesus.

398
00:34:55,128 --> 00:35:00,463
I gotta get up. I gotta get up.

399
00:35:02,094 --> 00:35:08,265
Shit. Come on, Joe. Come on, buddy.
Come on. Come on, pal.

400
00:35:08,266 --> 00:35:11,477
You said you'd get to the
States before me.

401
00:35:11,478 --> 00:35:14,480
You ain't going anywhere.
You're okay.

402
00:35:14,481 --> 00:35:18,442
- I gotta get my helmet!
- Forget it, Joe.

403
00:35:18,443 --> 00:35:22,572
- Anyone there? Help!
- Hang on.

404
00:35:24,616 --> 00:35:27,118
- Who's that?
- Heff! Babe!

405
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:30,736
- Hang on.
- Come on, get me out of here, Lip!

406
00:35:32,165 --> 00:35:34,125
I gotta get to the hole!

407
00:35:34,126 --> 00:35:38,665
- I got you. Come on, Joe, I got you.
- I gotta get to the hole!

408
00:35:40,882 --> 00:35:43,100
Come on, Joe.

409
00:35:44,469 --> 00:35:46,387
Hang on.

410
00:35:46,388 --> 00:35:47,763
- You okay?
- Yeah.

411
00:35:47,764 --> 00:35:49,932
Come on. Come on!

412
00:35:49,933 --> 00:35:53,186
Think I overdid the
cover for my foxhole?

413
00:35:53,353 --> 00:35:57,607
- Incoming!
- Incoming!

414
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,414
Take cover!

415
00:36:08,201 --> 00:36:11,537
Come on! Come on! Hurry up!

416
00:36:11,538 --> 00:36:15,458
Guarno! You're gonna get bombed!
Come on! Come on!

417
00:36:15,459 --> 00:36:18,519
Move it, Bill! Move it.

418
00:36:19,254 --> 00:36:24,464
- Come on, Joe.
- Hold on, I'll be there! I'll help!

419
00:36:24,926 --> 00:36:27,894
No!

420
00:36:29,264 --> 00:36:31,675
Medic!

421
00:36:37,189 --> 00:36:41,398
During the second barrage,
I wasn 't laughing anymore.

422
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:19,719
Lip!

423
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:24,845
Are you okay?

424
00:37:27,197 --> 00:37:29,907
Stay down!

425
00:37:29,908 --> 00:37:33,911
- You stay down!
- 1 st Sgt. Lipton?

426
00:37:33,912 --> 00:37:38,530
You get things organized here.
I'm gonna go for help.

427
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:44,434
What the fuck?

428
00:37:48,093 --> 00:37:50,594
- Where is he going?
- I don't know.

429
00:37:50,595 --> 00:37:53,514
Get Battalion on the line
to notify BAS.

430
00:37:53,515 --> 00:37:55,971
Battalion's up, Lip.

431
00:38:08,530 --> 00:38:11,385
Medic!

432
00:38:20,125 --> 00:38:23,711
Stay ready! They might
be trying to come through.

433
00:38:23,712 --> 00:38:25,921
- You okay, One Lung?
- Sergeant!

434
00:38:25,922 --> 00:38:27,423
How you doing, Popeye?

435
00:38:27,424 --> 00:38:30,916
Hundred percent ready
to kill Germans, Lip!

436
00:38:41,146 --> 00:38:44,479
- Doc, what can I do?
- Hold this.

437
00:38:46,234 --> 00:38:48,804
- You got a smoke?
- Yeah.

438
00:38:49,404 --> 00:38:54,909
Jesus. What's a guy gotta do
to get killed around here?

439
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:58,454
- Bill, you go first.
- Whatever you say, doc.

440
00:38:58,455 --> 00:39:01,082
Over here. Take this man.

441
00:39:01,083 --> 00:39:06,498
- Hey, they got old Guarnere this time.
- We got you, soldier.

442
00:39:08,965 --> 00:39:11,217
Just lie back.

443
00:39:14,638 --> 00:39:18,653
Hey, Joe, I told you I'd beat
you back to the States.

444
00:39:19,643 --> 00:39:21,656
Hey, Lip.

445
00:39:24,439 --> 00:39:26,657
How's Buck?

446
00:39:27,484 --> 00:39:30,444
- Luz, how's Buck?
- He's fine.

447
00:39:30,445 --> 00:39:33,095
- You sure?
- Yes, he's fine.

448
00:39:33,198 --> 00:39:36,815
I think you should
probably go talk to him.

449
00:39:38,829 --> 00:39:41,047
All right.

450
00:39:50,298 --> 00:39:55,302
Some say Buck changed after
he was shot in Holland. Maybe.

451
00:39:55,303 --> 00:40:00,513
Something happened to him when he
saw Toye and Guarnere on the ground.

452
00:40:09,317 --> 00:40:14,447
The report said Compton was being
taken off because of bad trench foot.

453
00:40:14,448 --> 00:40:18,702
Didn 't say anything about
him losing his friends.

454
00:40:24,499 --> 00:40:27,418
Buck was a great combat leader.

455
00:40:27,419 --> 00:40:30,796
He was wounded in Normandy
and again in Holland.

456
00:40:30,797 --> 00:40:35,134
He received the Silver Star
for taking out those German guns.

457
00:40:35,135 --> 00:40:38,672
He took everything
the Krauts could throw.

458
00:40:39,348 --> 00:40:41,725
Lieutenant Compton?

459
00:40:42,851 --> 00:40:48,064
"UCLA did not make the Rose Bowl,
probably because you weren't there.

460
00:40:48,065 --> 00:40:53,486
I'm sure you're teaching your young
soldiers the joy you have of the sport.

461
00:40:53,487 --> 00:40:59,505
How we all know what an exciting young
man you are, how your heart and love..."

462
00:41:02,662 --> 00:41:07,875
I guess he just couldn 't take seeing
Toye and Guarnere all torn up.

463
00:41:07,876 --> 00:41:12,085
No one ever thought any
less of him for it.

464
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:23,448
Hey, Bull.

465
00:41:23,892 --> 00:41:28,229
With Buck off the line,
there was no alternative to Dike.

466
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:30,398
At least none we could see.

467
00:41:30,399 --> 00:41:32,332
Thanks.

468
00:41:33,944 --> 00:41:36,002
Hey, Muck.

469
00:41:36,738 --> 00:41:40,157
- Muck. I'm looking for Lt. Dike.
- Yes, sergeant.

470
00:41:40,158 --> 00:41:44,856
We were stuck with Dike.
And he was off taking a walk.

471
00:41:49,376 --> 00:41:52,670
Lightning Six, Kidnap.

472
00:41:52,671 --> 00:41:55,381
We've cleared all the green area...

473
00:41:55,382 --> 00:41:57,883
We'd cleared the woods
east of Foy.

474
00:41:57,884 --> 00:42:02,888
Later, E Company and the rest of the 506
cleared the woods west of Foy.

475
00:42:02,889 --> 00:42:05,433
There was little resistance.

476
00:42:05,434 --> 00:42:09,311
- We have KIA.
- Thirteen.

477
00:42:09,312 --> 00:42:13,357
You fellas know I got no reason
to bullshit you, right?

478
00:42:13,358 --> 00:42:15,443
Look, this is what I saw.

479
00:42:15,444 --> 00:42:18,946
It was so unbelievable
you might not believe me.

480
00:42:18,947 --> 00:42:22,950
You-know-who runs up.
No helmet, no gear, nothing.

481
00:42:22,951 --> 00:42:29,540
"1 st Sgt. Lipton, you organize
things here, and I'm gonna go for help."

482
00:42:29,541 --> 00:42:31,959
"I need to polish my oak leaves."

483
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:34,045
- Hey, Luz.
- Complete asshole.

484
00:42:34,046 --> 00:42:37,256
- That's really good.
- Fellas.

485
00:42:37,257 --> 00:42:40,384
- Good night, all.
- See you, Luz.

486
00:42:40,385 --> 00:42:41,927
Sarge?

487
00:42:41,928 --> 00:42:45,056
Two things.
First, great impression of Dike.

488
00:42:45,057 --> 00:42:48,476
- I thought it was off.
- You got it pretty good.

489
00:42:48,477 --> 00:42:53,773
Second, don't do it anymore, especially
the part about what he said to me.

490
00:42:53,774 --> 00:42:57,360
- It doesn't do anybody any good, okay?
- I got you.

491
00:42:57,361 --> 00:42:59,180
All right.

492
00:43:01,531 --> 00:43:03,942
Wiseass.

493
00:43:09,373 --> 00:43:11,704
Incoming!

494
00:43:29,017 --> 00:43:33,187
Luz! Luz! Come on! Luz! Hurry!

495
00:43:33,188 --> 00:43:36,899
Move! Luz!

496
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:42,822
Stay down! Stay down! Come on!
Get in here! Luz, come on!

497
00:43:42,823 --> 00:43:45,741
Luz! Come on, Luz! Come on!

498
00:43:45,742 --> 00:43:48,551
Come on! Luz!

499
00:44:17,232 --> 00:44:21,193
- Muck and Penkala!
- What?

500
00:44:21,194 --> 00:44:24,447
Muck and Penkala got hit!

501
00:44:31,997 --> 00:44:34,169
Medic!

502
00:44:37,878 --> 00:44:40,796
- Hashey!
- Shit, it's my shoulder.

503
00:44:40,797 --> 00:44:44,607
Come on! Get up! Move!

504
00:44:47,888 --> 00:44:51,903
Stay down! Incoming!

505
00:45:13,246 --> 00:45:17,136
- I thought you didn't smoke.
- I don't.

506
00:45:28,178 --> 00:45:32,348
The shell that hit the foxhole
Luz and I were in was a dud.

507
00:45:32,349 --> 00:45:38,062
The one that hit Muck and Penkala 's
foxhole wasn 't. That's the way it was.

508
00:45:38,063 --> 00:45:41,361
Muck and Penkala were good men.

509
00:45:43,402 --> 00:45:45,653
Their death hit Malarkey hard.

510
00:45:45,654 --> 00:45:49,198
His best friends were
Compton, Muck and Penkala.

511
00:45:49,199 --> 00:45:53,214
In less than a week,
he'd seen two of them die.

512
00:45:54,246 --> 00:45:57,248
- The word?
- The men on the line are okay.

513
00:45:57,249 --> 00:45:59,291
Food has been resupplied.

514
00:45:59,292 --> 00:46:02,753
We'll hunker down.
We might get relief soon.

515
00:46:02,754 --> 00:46:05,370
Okay? All right.

516
00:46:25,652 --> 00:46:29,905
Later that day, we were in our
old position overlooking Foy.

517
00:46:29,906 --> 00:46:33,200
We were all worried about Malarkey.

518
00:46:33,201 --> 00:46:35,612
Hey, Malark?

519
00:46:39,332 --> 00:46:46,431
Didn't I hear you say you wanted to
bring a Luger home to your kid brother?

520
00:46:54,056 --> 00:46:59,107
Well, why don't you give him that?

521
00:47:02,689 --> 00:47:05,733
- It's Hoob's, right?
- Yeah.

522
00:47:05,734 --> 00:47:10,112
Yeah, I was gonna
get rid of it, but I...

523
00:47:10,113 --> 00:47:12,524
I don't know.

524
00:47:13,450 --> 00:47:19,038
Captain Winters was wondering if
you wanted to go back to Battalion...

525
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:22,292
...and work as his runner
for a few days.

526
00:47:25,087 --> 00:47:29,466
Tell him thanks.
I'm gonna stay here.

527
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:35,346
Why don't you come back for an
hour or so, say goodbye to Buck?

528
00:47:35,347 --> 00:47:38,361
I'm sure it'll mean a lot to him.

529
00:47:43,063 --> 00:47:44,678
All right.

530
00:47:47,442 --> 00:47:50,012
You be careful with that.

531
00:47:50,946 --> 00:47:53,614
Getting 50 yards back for an hour...

532
00:47:53,615 --> 00:47:57,994
...could make a big difference
in a soldier's state of mind.

533
00:48:00,956 --> 00:48:03,833
The morning after the shelling...

534
00:48:03,834 --> 00:48:08,129
...I saw a soldier try to dig a
foxhole with his bare hands.

535
00:48:08,130 --> 00:48:12,049
He didn 't notice that he had
torn off his fingernails.

536
00:48:12,050 --> 00:48:16,846
I got him out of there quickly.
Not for his sake, but for ours.

537
00:48:16,847 --> 00:48:22,893
Fear is poison in combat. Something
we all felt but didn 't show. You can 't.

538
00:48:22,894 --> 00:48:26,909
It's destructive, and it's contagious.

539
00:48:28,316 --> 00:48:31,091
Told you I'd get you started.

540
00:48:37,034 --> 00:48:41,037
Buck was never the same after
Toye and Guarnere got hit.

541
00:48:41,038 --> 00:48:44,928
I guess he just needed
some time away from it all.

542
00:48:56,762 --> 00:49:00,473
The January 3rd barrages and
January 9th shelling...

543
00:49:00,474 --> 00:49:04,018
...marked the low point
for the men in E Company.

544
00:49:04,019 --> 00:49:06,604
Even then, very few actually broke.

545
00:49:06,605 --> 00:49:13,069
But I knew the terror and pressure
we'd been under could take their toll.

546
00:49:13,070 --> 00:49:17,531
I was afraid the men would lose focus,
suffer a drop in morale.

547
00:49:17,532 --> 00:49:21,202
And that was dangerous,
especially in combat.

548
00:49:21,203 --> 00:49:24,740
More of which lay in store for us.

549
00:49:25,791 --> 00:49:28,334
We'd cleared east and west of Foy.

550
00:49:28,335 --> 00:49:33,839
It was time for the inevitable assault
on Foy itself. I was dreading it.

551
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:38,177
The men who trained at Toccoa
wouldn 't get through unscathed.

552
00:49:38,178 --> 00:49:42,973
I was beginning to wonder if any
of us would make it through at all.

553
00:49:42,974 --> 00:49:47,436
We would lead the attacks.
The problem was, in my estimation...

554
00:49:47,437 --> 00:49:50,735
...E Company still did not
have a leader.

555
00:50:01,535 --> 00:50:07,428
Before the attack, I did something
I'd never have imagined myself doing.

556
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:16,978
Lip!

557
00:50:18,218 --> 00:50:22,631
- Didn't figure you for a smoking man.
- Neither did I.

558
00:50:26,101 --> 00:50:29,957
D Company, Lieutenant Speirs,
patrol order.

559
00:50:30,981 --> 00:50:32,606
So?

560
00:50:32,607 --> 00:50:35,735
We've been watching Foy,
not much activity.

561
00:50:35,736 --> 00:50:39,148
- Want a coffee?
- No, thank you, sir.

562
00:50:40,907 --> 00:50:44,827
- How's Easy's status?
- The men are good. Prepared.

563
00:50:44,828 --> 00:50:46,996
I lead 2nd Platoon tomorrow.

564
00:50:46,997 --> 00:50:52,835
They're the weakest after losing Toye
and Guarnere and Muck and Penkala.

565
00:50:52,836 --> 00:50:55,504
I have every confidence in the men.

566
00:50:55,505 --> 00:50:57,563
Good.

567
00:51:01,803 --> 00:51:06,216
But on the other hand,
I have no confidence in our CO.

568
00:51:06,808 --> 00:51:10,186
Lieutenant Dike is an
empty uniform, captain.

569
00:51:10,187 --> 00:51:14,965
He's just...
He's not there, sir.

570
00:51:15,984 --> 00:51:20,988
- He'll be there tomorrow.
- I understand he'll be there physically.

571
00:51:20,989 --> 00:51:25,785
Tomorrow will be the real deal.
He'll have to lead those men.

572
00:51:25,786 --> 00:51:29,580
He's gonna have
to make decisions, sir, and...

573
00:51:29,581 --> 00:51:34,359
...I think he's gonna get a lot
of Easy Company men killed.

574
00:51:37,881 --> 00:51:42,090
- Thank you, sergeant. That'll be all.
- Yes, sir.

575
00:51:45,055 --> 00:51:50,265
I said what I had to say.
There was nothing Winters could do.

576
00:51:53,105 --> 00:51:56,941
Couldn 't remove a
well-connected company CO...

577
00:51:56,942 --> 00:52:00,653
...because of the misgivings
of a first sergeant.

578
00:52:00,654 --> 00:52:04,990
You got an eighth of a mile
to cross before you get into Foy.

579
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:07,076
There's very little cover.

580
00:52:07,077 --> 00:52:10,746
Two sections of machine guns
will give you cover.

581
00:52:10,747 --> 00:52:14,917
3rd Battalion will come from the east
to cause distraction.

582
00:52:14,918 --> 00:52:17,086
D Company will be in reserve.

583
00:52:17,087 --> 00:52:20,381
The point is,
you gotta move in there fast.

584
00:52:20,382 --> 00:52:24,760
Before they can bring their
mortars and artillery down on you.

585
00:52:24,761 --> 00:52:26,846
- Clear?
- Clear.

586
00:52:26,847 --> 00:52:31,499
I'm relying on you. Get it done.

587
00:52:44,614 --> 00:52:48,629
- Covering fire!
- Let's go. Keep it moving.

588
00:52:50,370 --> 00:52:53,259
Suppressing fire!

589
00:52:55,250 --> 00:52:57,547
- Go, go, go!
- Keep moving!

590
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:06,211
Let's go! Let's go!

591
00:53:08,138 --> 00:53:11,471
- Suppressing fire!
- Feuer!

592
00:53:12,601 --> 00:53:15,137
Keep them tight, Shames!

593
00:53:16,146 --> 00:53:18,796
- Keep moving!
- Keep moving!

594
00:53:20,359 --> 00:53:22,372
Krauts in the open!

595
00:53:24,654 --> 00:53:27,156
Keep moving! Keep moving!

596
00:53:27,157 --> 00:53:29,295
Three inside!

597
00:53:31,495 --> 00:53:33,872
Wait a minute. Where's Foley?

598
00:53:34,664 --> 00:53:37,375
- Randleman!
- Coming through! Run!

599
00:53:37,376 --> 00:53:39,548
Liebgott!

600
00:53:40,045 --> 00:53:42,501
Where the hell is 1 st Platoon?

601
00:53:45,509 --> 00:53:48,678
- Hold up!
- Keep moving!

602
00:53:48,679 --> 00:53:50,930
Easy Company! Hold up!

603
00:53:50,931 --> 00:53:55,351
- 2nd Platoon! Hold up! Hold up!
- Will you move?

604
00:53:55,352 --> 00:53:58,396
- Get me Foley on the radio.
- Move!

605
00:53:58,397 --> 00:54:04,026
- Sir, I think we should take cover.
- Find some cover! Find some cover!

606
00:54:04,027 --> 00:54:05,676
What?

607
00:54:07,406 --> 00:54:09,699
- Easy Red, Easy...
- Six, over.

608
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:12,316
Six, Easy Red. Go ahead.

609
00:54:12,619 --> 00:54:15,371
Easy Red,
stand by for the Six.

610
00:54:15,372 --> 00:54:21,583
Foley, you get back here where
I can see you, goddamn it!

611
00:54:21,586 --> 00:54:25,756
1 st Platoon, hold up! Hold up!
Take cover! Martin!

612
00:54:25,757 --> 00:54:28,213
- Come with me!
- With you, sir.

613
00:54:29,344 --> 00:54:31,163
Feuer!

614
00:54:32,431 --> 00:54:35,320
Fall back! Fall back!

615
00:54:35,976 --> 00:54:37,795
Take cover!

616
00:54:37,978 --> 00:54:41,356
- Goddamn it.
- Go forward!

617
00:54:42,441 --> 00:54:45,985
- Herron, on me.
- Move back.

618
00:54:45,986 --> 00:54:47,653
Stay on my ass.

619
00:54:47,654 --> 00:54:51,824
- Hold fast, 2nd Platoon!
- Follow Lipton! Take cover!

620
00:54:51,825 --> 00:54:54,952
What are we doing?
Why are we stopped?

621
00:54:54,953 --> 00:54:57,663
Fall back! Fall back!

622
00:54:57,664 --> 00:55:00,166
Roger, Kidnap. Stand by for Six.

623
00:55:00,167 --> 00:55:04,216
- Lieutenant, what's the plan?
- I don't know!

624
00:55:04,546 --> 00:55:06,756
Get Dike on that radio now!

625
00:55:06,757 --> 00:55:09,675
- What's the plan?
- Captain Winters, sir.

626
00:55:09,676 --> 00:55:14,089
- Give us a plan!
- Okay. Foley, take your men...

627
00:55:14,139 --> 00:55:19,952
Take your men around the village
and attack from the rear.

628
00:55:20,354 --> 00:55:22,396
We cannot stay here!

629
00:55:22,397 --> 00:55:25,191
Want 1 st Platoon to attack by itself?

630
00:55:25,192 --> 00:55:29,362
- We'll provide suppressing fire.
- We'll be alone out there.

631
00:55:29,363 --> 00:55:33,378
We will provide suppressing fire!

632
00:55:39,414 --> 00:55:42,249
Get going forward!

633
00:55:42,250 --> 00:55:47,062
You need to talk
to Captain Winters, sir.

634
00:55:48,757 --> 00:55:51,258
Sir! Okay, here it is.

635
00:55:51,259 --> 00:55:55,096
We go on a flanking run
and attack from the rear.

636
00:55:55,097 --> 00:55:58,557
Take them.
Find cover behind this table.

637
00:55:58,558 --> 00:56:01,060
Go! Go!

638
00:56:01,061 --> 00:56:03,631
- Shit!
- Jesus Christ.

639
00:56:04,189 --> 00:56:07,408
Webb, move up! Find cover!

640
00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:18,639
Suppressing fire now!

641
00:56:20,497 --> 00:56:23,290
Perconte! I got you!

642
00:56:23,291 --> 00:56:26,180
Give me some cover.

643
00:56:27,337 --> 00:56:31,386
- How you doing, Perconte?
- They shot me in my ass!

644
00:56:32,718 --> 00:56:36,512
- Stay down.
- We lost five men. Can you locate?

645
00:56:36,513 --> 00:56:42,292
- The building with the caved-in roof!
- The building with the caved-in roof!

646
00:56:47,774 --> 00:56:53,404
Sir, we are sitting ducks here.
We have to keep moving!

647
00:56:53,405 --> 00:56:58,409
- You've got to keep moving!
- Dick! Captain Winters!

648
00:56:58,410 --> 00:57:04,223
You do not go out there! You're the
battalion commander. Get back here!

649
00:57:04,708 --> 00:57:10,254
- I understand your attachment to Easy...
- Speirs! Get yourself over here!

650
00:57:10,255 --> 00:57:13,827
Go relieve Dike
and take that attack on in.

651
00:57:17,012 --> 00:57:20,822
- Go, soldier!
- Webb, fall back. You're too exposed!

652
00:57:21,308 --> 00:57:26,165
- Fall back! Fall back!
- Come on, Webb! Let's go, kid!

653
00:57:27,814 --> 00:57:31,431
- Hang on, Perco.
- Feuer!

654
00:57:33,487 --> 00:57:37,980
- What are we doing?
- Let's go!

655
00:57:38,450 --> 00:57:41,786
- I'm taking over. 1 st Sgt. Lipton!
- Here!

656
00:57:41,787 --> 00:57:45,289
- What do we got?
- The company is spread out here.

657
00:57:45,290 --> 00:57:47,792
1 st Platoon tried an end-around.

658
00:57:47,793 --> 00:57:50,920
They're pinned by a sniper
in that building.

659
00:57:50,921 --> 00:57:55,549
I want mortars and grenade launchers.
I want 1 st to go straight in.

660
00:57:55,550 --> 00:57:59,008
- Everybody else, follow me.
- Thank God!

661
00:57:59,888 --> 00:58:02,982
- Move it!
- 3rd Platoon, let's go! Go!

662
00:58:03,934 --> 00:58:07,019
You heard the word.
2nd Platoon on the CO!

663
00:58:07,020 --> 00:58:10,239
- Sergeant Alley!
- Got it, sarge!

664
00:58:13,485 --> 00:58:17,029
Okay, 1 st Platoon!
Move out! Move out!

665
00:58:17,030 --> 00:58:21,200
- On your feet, 2nd Platoon!
- Move out!

666
00:58:21,201 --> 00:58:25,853
Get on your goddamn feet!
Move it! Come on!

667
00:58:28,458 --> 00:58:32,878
Come on, let's get the bastards!
Right flank!

668
00:58:32,879 --> 00:58:34,892
Feuer!

669
00:58:36,508 --> 00:58:39,760
- Come on, move out!
- Fire!

670
00:58:39,761 --> 00:58:42,471
- Feuer!
- Take cover!

671
00:58:42,472 --> 00:58:44,485
Feuer!

672
00:58:45,559 --> 00:58:49,415
- Go, go, go!
- Come on! Come on!

673
00:58:51,023 --> 00:58:52,898
Radio, get over here.

674
00:58:52,899 --> 00:58:56,357
- Take cover!
- Fire!

675
00:58:56,653 --> 00:58:58,112
Sir.

676
00:58:58,113 --> 00:58:59,602
Lipton.

677
00:59:00,532 --> 00:59:03,242
Streetfight, ltem. Easy Six. Over.

678
00:59:03,243 --> 00:59:07,246
- What do you see, Lipton?
- Armor and a lot of infantry.

679
00:59:07,247 --> 00:59:10,750
I Company's supposed
to be on the other side.

680
00:59:10,751 --> 00:59:12,418
- Radio, anything?
- No.

681
00:59:12,419 --> 00:59:15,838
If we don't connect with I,
they'll slip away.

682
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:19,383
- That's right. Wait here.
- Item! Ltem! Easy Six.

683
00:59:19,384 --> 00:59:21,602
What the hell?

684
00:59:32,731 --> 00:59:36,484
At first the Germans
didn 't shoot at him.

685
00:59:36,485 --> 00:59:39,904
They couldn 't believe
what they were seeing.

686
00:59:39,905 --> 00:59:42,490
That wasn 't the astounding thing.

687
00:59:42,491 --> 00:59:48,941
The astounding thing was, he hooked
up with I Company and came back.

688
01:00:20,278 --> 01:00:25,282
We took over 100 German prisoners.
After that, it was mostly cleanup.

689
01:00:25,283 --> 01:00:30,095
Let's go, move it. Move it.
Take them down to the barn.

690
01:00:33,583 --> 01:00:35,641
Sit down!

691
01:00:38,630 --> 01:00:43,043
- Sniper!
- Take cover! Take cover!

692
01:00:46,346 --> 01:00:48,973
Come on! Come on!

693
01:00:48,974 --> 01:00:51,271
Where is he?

694
01:00:51,977 --> 01:00:55,389
Shit. I can't see him.

695
01:00:57,816 --> 01:01:00,526
Second floor,
building on the right.

696
01:01:00,527 --> 01:01:04,337
Don't miss, Shifty. Now!

697
01:01:25,135 --> 01:01:29,305
Over here. I need help.
Can you guys come here and help me?

698
01:01:29,306 --> 01:01:33,642
Mellet, Herron, Sowosko and
Ken Webb were killed by a sniper.

699
01:01:33,643 --> 01:01:36,812
There would have been more
if not for Shifty.

700
01:01:36,813 --> 01:01:41,192
Work your party, walk your
wounded to the aid station.

701
01:01:41,193 --> 01:01:44,695
Let's not just lollygag.
Keep this moving.

702
01:01:44,696 --> 01:01:49,155
- Get these boys to the aid station.
- Okay, sergeant.

703
01:02:00,379 --> 01:02:04,131
- You hit bad, Perconte?
- Beautiful wound, Lip.

704
01:02:04,132 --> 01:02:06,509
Shot me right through my ass.

705
01:02:06,510 --> 01:02:08,094
- Hey, sarge?
- Yeah.

706
01:02:08,095 --> 01:02:11,013
- Is it true about Dike?
- Yeah.

707
01:02:11,014 --> 01:02:16,030
- Thank God for small mercies!
- Yeah.

708
01:02:27,906 --> 01:02:33,994
We'd been looking at Foy for a month
knowing that's where we had to go.

709
01:02:33,995 --> 01:02:37,567
It was a great relief to have done it.

710
01:02:38,291 --> 01:02:41,002
The men thought once
we'd taken Foy...

711
01:02:41,003 --> 01:02:45,172
...they'd get us off the line,
ship us back to Mourmelon.

712
01:02:45,173 --> 01:02:47,091
But that wasn 't to be.

713
01:02:47,092 --> 01:02:51,904
Two days later, we took Noville
and after that, Rachamps.

714
01:03:12,617 --> 01:03:15,828
We spent our night
in Rachamps in a convent.

715
01:03:15,829 --> 01:03:20,242
It was the first time we'd spent
a night indoors in a month.

716
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:37,340
The sisters brought in their choir
to sing for us. It was heaven.

717
01:03:43,732 --> 01:03:46,108
The mood of the men was relaxed.

718
01:03:46,109 --> 01:03:50,488
We were finally being relieved
and would soon be in Mourmelon.

719
01:03:50,489 --> 01:03:54,033
In the morning, we found out
Mourmelon would wait.

720
01:03:54,034 --> 01:03:56,577
Hitler had launched a counteroffensive.

721
01:03:56,578 --> 01:03:59,664
We were bound for Hagenau
to hold the line.

722
01:03:59,665 --> 01:04:06,081
But for that night, we didn 't know it yet.
That night, we were okay.

723
01:04:23,772 --> 01:04:28,359
I tried to make a roster for
the company to see who we had left.

724
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:33,447
We'd come into Belgium with 121 men
and officers plus 24 replacements.

725
01:04:33,448 --> 01:04:39,466
That's 145 total.
We were going out with 63.

726
01:04:39,871 --> 01:04:44,762
Guarnere was badly wounded,
and Hoobler died accidentally.

727
01:04:47,546 --> 01:04:50,640
Joe Toye had lost his leg.

728
01:04:56,138 --> 01:05:00,474
Among the dead were Herron,
Mellet, Sowosko, Kenneth Webb...

729
01:05:00,475 --> 01:05:05,366
...Harold Webb, Alex Penkala
and Skip Muck.

730
01:05:07,816 --> 01:05:12,069
A month in Belgium cost us
one good officer, Buck Compton...

731
01:05:12,070 --> 01:05:16,040
...and one bad one, Norman Dike.

732
01:05:19,202 --> 01:05:25,174
But we gained a good one in the end,
so I guess we came out ahead.

733
01:05:34,593 --> 01:05:38,642
- What is it?
- Nothing.

734
01:05:39,973 --> 01:05:44,591
I better get back to Battalion
before they disappear.

735
01:05:51,276 --> 01:05:54,445
- You wanna ask me, don't you?
- Ask you what?

736
01:05:54,446 --> 01:05:58,324
You wanna know if they're true,
the stories about me.

737
01:05:58,325 --> 01:06:03,162
With stories like that, everyone
heard it from someone who was there.

738
01:06:03,163 --> 01:06:08,501
When you ask that person, they say they
heard it from someone who was there.

739
01:06:08,502 --> 01:06:10,211
It's nothing new.

740
01:06:10,212 --> 01:06:14,215
If you went back 2000 years,
you'd hear centurions...

741
01:06:14,216 --> 01:06:19,679
...yakking about how Tertius lopped off
the heads of Carthaginian prisoners.

742
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:26,310
Maybe they kept talking about it because
they never heard Tertius deny it.

743
01:06:26,311 --> 01:06:30,690
Maybe Tertius knew
there was value to men thinking...

744
01:06:30,691 --> 01:06:35,343
...he was the toughest son of
a bitch in the whole Roman Legion.

745
01:06:35,862 --> 01:06:38,273
Sir?

746
01:06:39,241 --> 01:06:42,618
These men aren't
concerned about the stories.

747
01:06:42,619 --> 01:06:45,705
They're just glad to have you
as our CO.

748
01:06:45,706 --> 01:06:48,833
They're happy to have
a good leader again.

749
01:06:48,834 --> 01:06:51,460
I've heard they've always had one.

750
01:06:51,461 --> 01:06:55,423
I'm told there's been
one man they could count on.

751
01:06:55,424 --> 01:07:00,428
Led them into Bois Jacques, held
them together as they were shelled.

752
01:07:00,429 --> 01:07:05,391
Kept their spirits up, kept the men
focused, gave them direction.

753
01:07:05,392 --> 01:07:09,487
All the things
a good combat leader does.

754
01:07:13,608 --> 01:07:16,777
Do you have any idea
who I'm talking about?

755
01:07:16,778 --> 01:07:20,990
- No, sir.
- Hell, it was you, first sergeant.

756
01:07:20,991 --> 01:07:26,485
Ever since Winters made Battalion,
you've been the leader of Easy Company.

757
01:07:30,542 --> 01:07:37,131
Oh, and you're not gonna be first
sergeant much longer, first sergeant.

758
01:07:37,132 --> 01:07:39,145
Sir?

759
01:07:39,176 --> 01:07:43,637
Winters put in for a battlefield
commission. Sink approved.

760
01:07:43,638 --> 01:07:47,687
You should get the official nod
in a few days.

761
01:07:49,353 --> 01:07:53,209
Congratulations, lieutenant.

762
01:08:14,711 --> 01:08:17,296
Hey, look, it's 1 st Battalion.

763
01:08:17,297 --> 01:08:19,924
- Hey! Hey!
- What do you want?

764
01:08:19,925 --> 01:08:22,814
Thanks for crapping in our foxholes.

765
01:08:22,928 --> 01:08:25,680
- Hey, it's our pleasure.
- Yeah.

766
01:08:25,681 --> 01:08:28,934
Enjoy the walk, boys.

767
01:08:40,404 --> 01:08:45,261
There they go, Easy Company,
riding out again.
