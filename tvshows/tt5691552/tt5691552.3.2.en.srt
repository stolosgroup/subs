We've been assigned to pick up
Vice Admiral Christie from Outpost 35

7
00:00:31,538 --> 00:00:34,475
and then transport him
to rendezvous with a Krill vessel.

8
00:00:34,499 --> 00:00:36,978
Once there,
the Admiral will begin negotiations

9
00:00:37,002 --> 00:00:39,814
to allow Union access
to the Naklav Sector.

11
00:00:41,882 --> 00:00:44,611

Union ships have never had a conduit.

Until now.

13
00:00:46,052 --> 00:00:49,657
- Early indications are that,
with treaty negotiations going smoothly,

14
00:00:49,681 --> 00:00:53,077
the Krill may be willing
to permit passage, which means...

15
00:00:53,101 --> 00:00:56,623
entire regions of unexplored space
are gonna be wide open.

- Does he believe we can trust them?

17
00:00:58,732 --> 00:01:02,044
- That's the word.
Christie's one of the top Union diplomats.

18
00:01:02,068 --> 00:01:05,131
He was the guy who negotiated
the Din'jon Accords.

who shepherded the Lock Vai pact,

21
00:01:10,661 --> 00:01:14,498

And I must admit, seeing your name

You were married to Admiral Christie?

128
00:09:19,483 --> 00:09:21,211
- It was a long time ago.

129
00:09:21,235 --> 00:09:24,964
I was a medical student at Union Point.
He was one of my professors.

130
00:09:24,988 --> 00:09:28,759
We started seeing each other
at the beginning of my final year.

131
00:09:28,783 --> 00:09:31,054
Kept it a secret until I graduated.

132
00:09:31,078 --> 00:09:33,723
Then, six months later, we got married.

133
00:09:33,747 --> 00:09:37,394
The official story was that
we'd only been together a short time

134
00:09:37,418 --> 00:09:40,813
and then rushed to the altar,
but I don't think anyone was fooled.

135
00:09:40,837 --> 00:09:42,941
- Never in a billion years
would I have pegged you

136
00:09:42,965 --> 00:09:44,776
as someone who'd
hook up with your professor.

137
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,904
- Everything forbidden is sweet.

138
00:09:47,928 --> 00:09:49,322
- So what happened?

139
00:09:49,346 --> 00:09:52,992
- Long story short:
I don't think he really wanted a wife.

140
00:09:53,016 --> 00:09:56,496
He wanted someone young and smiling

141
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:00,208
to come home to at the end of the night
after a long day's work.

142
00:10:00,232 --> 00:10:03,211
Which was sort of how it was
when I was still in school,

143
00:10:03,235 --> 00:10:08,383
but once the ranks were dropped,
I was looking for a partner.

144
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:09,884
He was looking for a bed-warmer.

145
00:10:09,908 --> 00:10:12,161
I gave him an ultimatum, and...

146
00:10:13,036 --> 00:10:14,306
he walked away.

147
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:15,723
- Were you devastated?

148
00:10:15,747 --> 00:10:18,351
- At the time, I was crushed, yeah.

149
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:20,895
I questioned everything about myself.

150
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:23,815
Every way I turned it over in my head,

151
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:27,319
I kept feeling like
I was the one at fault,

152
00:10:27,343 --> 00:10:29,321
like I made a huge mistake.

153
00:10:29,345 --> 00:10:32,740
But when I remember it now, it's like...

154
00:10:32,764 --> 00:10:35,452
I'm watching someone else's daughter.

155
00:10:35,476 --> 00:10:40,230
I'm sad for her, but I know
she needs to learn her own lessons.

156
00:10:41,648 --> 00:10:43,460
- It must've been really hard
seeing him again.

157
00:10:43,484 --> 00:10:47,297
- Oh, in a weird way,
I think it was harder for him.

158
00:10:47,321 --> 00:10:49,757
- Well, yeah, I get that.

159
00:10:49,781 --> 00:10:51,926
The pain can be worse
when you're the one ending things.

- Personally, I'd always rather be
dumped than be the dumper.

161
00:10:55,745 --> 00:10:57,098
- Same.

162
00:10:57,122 --> 00:11:00,209
- Anyway, different lifetime.
On to the future.

163
00:11:00,792 --> 00:11:03,313
- Well, maybe one of the Krill is single.

164
00:11:03,337 --> 00:11:05,357
That's a thought.

165
00:11:05,381 --> 00:11:07,192
And, hey, there's two of them.

166
00:11:09,593 --> 00:11:12,197
- I can't date anyone who dresses
more glam than I do.

167
00:11:12,221 --> 00:11:13,573
- Okay, fair enough.

168
00:11:21,938 --> 00:11:25,751
- We have considered your request
for passage through our territory,

169
00:11:25,775 --> 00:11:27,379
and we are prepared to grant it.

170
00:11:27,403 --> 00:11:29,755
But there are certain conditions.

171
00:11:29,779 --> 00:11:31,424
- We're listening.

172
00:11:31,448 --> 00:11:35,011
- There is an uninhabited planet
in Union space

173
00:11:35,035 --> 00:11:36,513
that is rich in harcarium.

174
00:11:36,537 --> 00:11:38,890
We use it in our propulsion systems.

175
00:11:38,914 --> 00:11:41,267
We wish to secure extraction rights.

176
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:44,979
- Where?
- The third planet in the Obrall system.

177
00:11:45,003 --> 00:11:46,772
- Well, I think that can be arranged.

178
00:11:46,796 --> 00:11:49,775
I'll need to get approval
from the Union Council, of course.

179
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:52,445
- Passage will be allowed
for one vessel alone.

180
00:11:52,469 --> 00:11:53,779
If there are no...

181
00:11:53,803 --> 00:11:57,283
incidents,
we will consider further allowances.

182
00:11:57,307 --> 00:12:00,912
- Well, I don't think anyone here would
object to getting the first solo crack

183
00:12:00,936 --> 00:12:02,539
at unexplored space.

184
00:12:02,563 --> 00:12:04,583
- No, sir, we would not.

185
00:12:04,607 --> 00:12:10,338
- While in our space, your vessel will
follow this course to the Naklav Sector.

186
00:12:10,362 --> 00:12:12,924
Any deviation will be forbidden to you.

187
00:12:12,948 --> 00:12:15,801
- Not exactly the quickest way
to get there,

188
00:12:15,825 --> 00:12:17,470
but it shouldn't be a problem.

189
00:12:17,494 --> 00:12:18,513
Anything else?

190
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:20,473
- Upon entry into our territory,

191
00:12:20,497 --> 00:12:22,975
a tracking beacon will be installed
on your ship

192
00:12:22,999 --> 00:12:26,062
so we can monitor
your coordinates at all times.

193
00:12:26,086 --> 00:12:28,690
- That would be a violation
of our security protocols.

194
00:12:28,714 --> 00:12:32,151
- I think it's all right, Commander.
We really don't have anything to hide.

195
00:12:32,175 --> 00:12:33,636
Captain?

196
00:12:34,261 --> 00:12:37,616
- I'm sure we can find
a way to accommodate.

197
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:40,993
- We have little to no information
about the regions beyond your space

198
00:12:41,017 --> 00:12:42,662
that we intend to explore.

199
00:12:42,686 --> 00:12:46,708
Anything your cartographers could share
with us would be greatly appreciated,

200
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:49,443
especially concerning the Kalarr Expanse.

201
00:12:51,236 --> 00:12:52,547
- You...

202
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:55,758
do not intend to enter the Expanse?

203
00:12:55,782 --> 00:12:56,926
- Why wouldn't we?

204
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:58,827
- It is a domain of evil.

205
00:12:59,495 --> 00:13:01,431
- What do you mean?

206
00:13:01,455 --> 00:13:04,643
- Demons dwell within the Expanse.

207
00:13:04,667 --> 00:13:06,519
- Could you be a little more specific?

208
00:13:06,543 --> 00:13:10,356
- The Anhkana warns of Shadow Realms.

209
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,651
Gateways to the depths of the underworld,

210
00:13:12,675 --> 00:13:14,235
where demons lie in wait

211
00:13:14,259 --> 00:13:18,972
to possess the souls of those
who dare to stray within their reach.

212
00:13:19,556 --> 00:13:21,576
They corrupt all that is holy.

213
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,496
Within their grasp,
even the most righteous

214
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:29,292
can be forced to commit
unspeakable acts of depravity.

215
00:13:29,316 --> 00:13:34,046
- Do you have any direct evidence
that these "demons" really exist?

216
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:38,092
- It is written in the Anhkana.
That is all the evidence we need.

217
00:13:38,116 --> 00:13:41,971
- We appreciate the warning,
and we'll take every precaution,

218
00:13:41,995 --> 00:13:45,183
but that area covers
more than half the sector.

219
00:13:45,207 --> 00:13:47,018
We are explorers.

220
00:13:47,042 --> 00:13:52,047
So if it's all the same to you, we'd like
to see for ourselves what's out there.

221
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:56,403
- We will not stop you.

222
00:13:56,427 --> 00:13:59,597
But do not expect us to save you.

223
00:14:15,987 --> 00:14:18,007
- Consul, Ambassador.

224
00:14:18,031 --> 00:14:22,053
We wish you safe travels, and we want
to thank you again for your generosity.

225
00:14:22,077 --> 00:14:24,305
I know I speak for the entire Union

226
00:14:24,329 --> 00:14:28,435
when I say there is no greater gift
than the promise of new knowledge.

227
00:14:28,459 --> 00:14:31,920
- Sala tallo ka vaspa ko loy.

228
00:14:32,504 --> 00:14:34,065
- What does that mean?

229
00:14:34,089 --> 00:14:35,609
- It is a prayer.

230
00:14:35,633 --> 00:14:38,093
For those who are about to die.

231
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:12,979
- The question is,
do we take their warning seriously?

232
00:15:13,003 --> 00:15:14,815
- Tom, you're kidding, right?

233
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:16,232
I mean, consider the source.

234
00:15:16,256 --> 00:15:19,319
I'm just suggesting
the possibility that their claim,

235
00:15:19,343 --> 00:15:20,987
absurd though it may be,

236
00:15:21,011 --> 00:15:23,239
could indicate the presence
of some real threat.

237
00:15:23,263 --> 00:15:26,493
And because they're Krill, they process it
through the lens of their religion.

238
00:15:26,517 --> 00:15:28,662
- Which still doesn't give us
much of a road map.

239
00:15:28,686 --> 00:15:30,288
I mean, their religion is...

240
00:15:30,312 --> 00:15:32,123
confusing, to say the least.

241
00:15:32,147 --> 00:15:33,750
- All religions are confusing.

242
00:15:33,774 --> 00:15:35,877
How do you think the priests
stay in business?

243
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:39,213
- Did they offer any concrete evidence
to support their claims?

244
00:15:39,237 --> 00:15:41,215
- No. In fact, from what we gather,

245
00:15:41,239 --> 00:15:44,845
none of their ships have ventured
into the Expanse in more than a century.

246
00:15:44,869 --> 00:15:47,472
- The copy of the Anhkana
we have in our database

247
00:15:47,496 --> 00:15:50,183
has a few passages about "Shadow Realms."

248
00:15:50,207 --> 00:15:53,812
Lots of colorful language
about soul-sucking demons

249
00:15:53,836 --> 00:15:55,647
with eight eyes and huge fangs.

250
00:15:55,671 --> 00:15:57,106
Horror movie stuff.

251
00:15:57,130 --> 00:15:59,734
- And if this were a horror movie,
I'd say don't go into the house.

252
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:02,904
But obviously their religion
has a powerful influence

253
00:16:02,928 --> 00:16:04,489
over their perception of reality.

254
00:16:04,513 --> 00:16:08,368
- Agreed. But it should not stand
in the way of Union exploration.

255
00:16:08,392 --> 00:16:10,871
We need to seize the opportunity
while we can.

256
00:16:10,895 --> 00:16:12,539
- Ed? What do you think?

257
00:16:12,563 --> 00:16:16,209
- Visions of horror always have
mortal origins.

258
00:16:16,233 --> 00:16:18,586
If there is something out there,
it's not supernatural.

259
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:22,256
- Could still be dangerous.
- Exploration always carries risk.

260
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,782
I say we risk it.

261
00:16:24,324 --> 00:16:25,552

Cozy place.

that little bistro we used to go to

What was it called?

I'm coming with you to explore

didn't have anything to do with me.

00:19:54,701 --> 00:19:57,305
I know you're all just as excited as I am,

319
00:19:57,329 --> 00:20:01,476
and I know you're all
going to do your best, so...

320
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,937
let's give this everything we got,

321
00:20:03,961 --> 00:20:05,480
and...

322
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:07,690
may the force be with you.

323
00:20:07,714 --> 00:20:10,050
How was that?
- Perfect.

324
00:20:12,761 --> 00:20:15,722
- Set course and engage quantum drive.

325
00:20:26,566 --> 00:20:27,794
- Isaac.

326
00:20:27,818 --> 00:20:29,712
That is correct.

327
00:20:29,736 --> 00:20:32,841
- We haven't been formally introduced.
I'm Admiral Christie.

328
00:20:32,865 --> 00:20:34,884
- I am pleased to meet you, Admiral.

329
00:20:34,908 --> 00:20:36,928
- Am I interrupting anything important?

330
00:20:36,952 --> 00:20:38,180
- Yes.

331
00:20:38,204 --> 00:20:40,056
- Oh.

332
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,851
- I am upgrading the scanner array
for our journey.

333
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:45,979
- Well, I won't take too much
of your time.

334
00:20:46,003 --> 00:20:49,149
I must admit I was a little dubious
about meeting you.

335
00:20:49,173 --> 00:20:52,318
A Kaylon serving on a Union ship.

336
00:20:52,342 --> 00:20:53,677
After what happened.

337
00:20:54,344 --> 00:20:57,032
But I read the after-action battle report.

338
00:20:57,056 --> 00:20:59,951
I see that you saved a lot of lives.
I commend you for that.

339
00:20:59,975 --> 00:21:01,744
- Thank you, sir.

340
00:21:01,768 --> 00:21:04,706
- I was wondering if I could ask you
a few questions.

341
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:08,793
- The entirety of my official report
is available in the ship's computer.

342
00:21:08,817 --> 00:21:11,046
- No, not about the battle.

343
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:12,696
About Dr. Finn.

344
00:21:15,074 --> 00:21:18,344
I've heard from a few folks
on board that you two were...

345
00:21:18,368 --> 00:21:19,595
involved.

346
00:21:19,619 --> 00:21:21,347
- That is accurate.

347
00:21:21,371 --> 00:21:25,084
- Well, you know,
I was with Claire, too, a long time ago.

348
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:27,562
- Then we share a common experience.

349
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:29,755
- After all this time...

350
00:21:30,256 --> 00:21:33,884
she's moved on,
but I'm afraid that I haven't.

351
00:21:35,552 --> 00:21:37,530
I hope you don't mind me telling you this.

352
00:21:37,554 --> 00:21:38,781
- No, sir.

353
00:21:38,805 --> 00:21:42,702
I have observed many such paradoxes
in human relationships.

354
00:21:42,726 --> 00:21:44,310
- Well, to be blunt...

355
00:21:45,062 --> 00:21:47,623
I was hoping you could give me
some insight

356
00:21:47,647 --> 00:21:50,150
into what makes Claire happy these days.

357
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:54,256
- Dr. Finn values her children
above all else.

358
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:57,991
She has often stated that she would
sacrifice her own life for them.

359
00:21:59,868 --> 00:22:00,803
- Go on.

360
00:22:00,827 --> 00:22:05,934
- Her career as a Union medical officer
is also a crucial part of her identity.

361
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:09,896
She is highly empathetic and takes
great satisfaction in helping others.

362
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,648
- She always has.

363
00:22:11,672 --> 00:22:16,194
- Her recreational interests include
music, dancing, fine dining,

364
00:22:16,218 --> 00:22:18,613
rain showers and sexual relations.

365
00:22:18,637 --> 00:22:20,657
Her preferred mating positions include...

366
00:22:20,681 --> 00:22:24,661

But big, like as big as you.

Some kind of creature.
It got Lieutenant Woodson.

- His face...

667
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:52,855
There were big black shiny eyes.

668
00:47:52,879 --> 00:47:54,423
And his skin was...

669

- Demonic possession.
- Huh?

672
00:48:02,848 --> 00:48:07,203
- The Krill warned us that
this part of space was inhabited by...

673
00:48:07,227 --> 00:48:10,665
demons who would
take possession of your soul.

it's exactly how they would interpret it.

676
00:48:14,777 --> 00:48:18,089
- The microbes that Paul
was exposed to on that outpost

677
00:48:18,113 --> 00:48:21,301
almost immediately started
rewriting his DNA,

678

turning his cells into...

679

- Another species.

680
00:48:24,703 --> 00:48:29,392
- When the Admiral escaped sickbay,
his transmutation was accelerating.

681
00:48:29,416 --> 00:48:31,269
He must have infected others.

682
00:48:31,293 --> 00:48:35,982
What Marcus described is most likely
a more potent version of the microbes.

683
00:48:36,006 --> 00:48:37,484
- Reproduction.

684
00:48:37,508 --> 00:48:38,735
- That's my guess.

685
00:48:38,759 --> 00:48:42,489
It may be that their natural means
of procreation

686
00:48:42,513 --> 00:48:45,533
is to hijack the bodies
of other lifeforms.

687
00:48:45,557 --> 00:48:48,202
Like a parasite,
only much more aggressive.

- Then the distress call we received...

689

- Oh, man...

691
00:48:53,774 --> 00:48:56,670
- There's no telling how many
of our people have been infected.

We need to contain the spread
as quickly as possible.

693

- Commander Lamarr
was attempting to restore power

from within the engineering conduits.

695
00:49:04,368 --> 00:49:06,805
He is likely unaware of the alien threat.

Do you require assistance?

699

We have a patient.

Ten million kilometers and closing.

There's no recognizable DNA.

744
00:55:34,842 --> 00:55:38,947
Whoever this is, his genome
has been completely transformed.

I can't even tell what species he was.

746

- Is there anything you can do?

747
00:55:42,516 --> 00:55:45,954
- If there was a fragment
of his original genetic template, maybe...

748
00:55:45,978 --> 00:55:47,247
- I'll assemble a security detail.

749
00:55:47,271 --> 00:55:49,291
We'll go after them one by one
if that's what it takes.

750
00:55:49,315 --> 00:55:52,276
- Wait a minute.
I'm reading white blood cells.

751
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:54,695
He was human.

752
00:55:55,403 --> 00:55:58,883
The cell count is low. Really low.

753
00:55:58,907 --> 00:56:00,302
- What does that mean?

754
00:56:00,326 --> 00:56:04,014
- It means the transformative process
takes an enormous toll on the body.

755
00:56:04,038 --> 00:56:06,599
Based on the scan,
it must be at least a couple of weeks

756
00:56:06,623 --> 00:56:09,519
before their immune systems
are back up to full strength.

757
00:56:09,543 --> 00:56:10,836
- Then they have a weakness.

758
00:56:12,171 --> 00:56:14,298
- I could create a synthetic virus.

759
00:56:16,717 --> 00:56:19,403
It wouldn't have to be any stronger
than the common cold,

760
00:56:19,427 --> 00:56:21,489
and it'd probably be fatal to them.

761
00:56:21,513 --> 00:56:24,284
We could disperse it
in aerosolized form throughout the ship.

762
00:56:24,308 --> 00:56:25,618
They'd have no immunity.

763
00:56:25,642 --> 00:56:26,935
- What about us?

764
00:56:28,103 --> 00:56:29,855
- You might get the sniffles.

765
00:56:30,522 --> 00:56:31,815
- I am prepared.

766
00:56:36,862 --> 00:56:38,923
- Claire, even if this works...

767
00:56:38,947 --> 00:56:41,092
these are our shipmates
we're talking about.

768
00:56:41,116 --> 00:56:43,178
They didn't ask for what happened to them.

769
00:56:43,202 --> 00:56:45,055
- Are they still our shipmates?

770
00:56:45,079 --> 00:56:46,014
You heard her.

771
00:56:46,038 --> 00:56:47,932
They're a completely
different species now.

772
00:56:47,956 --> 00:56:50,227
We don't even know if there's
anything left of what they were.

773
00:56:50,251 --> 00:56:53,897
- More importantly, it's us versus them.
I vote for us.

774
00:56:53,921 --> 00:56:57,067
- If there was some way
we could communicate with them,

775
00:56:57,091 --> 00:56:58,902
to give them a warning.

776
00:56:58,926 --> 00:57:00,528
- A chance to leave peacefully.

777
00:57:00,552 --> 00:57:02,530
- Maybe there's a way.

778
00:57:02,554 --> 00:57:04,657
Scan the ship for Selayan sunstone.

779

783
00:57:14,108 --> 00:57:15,752
Paul was wearing his.

784

If he still has it,
we may be able to locate him.

maybe I can reach him.

803
00:59:34,831 --> 00:59:37,418
Take your people and go.

804
00:59:51,307 --> 00:59:52,391
Paul...

805
00:59:53,767 --> 00:59:57,687
If any small part of you
is still in there...

806
00:59:59,815 --> 01:00:02,585
I want you to try to remember...

807
01:00:02,609 --> 01:00:03,569
when we were together.

808
01:00:04,570 --> 01:00:07,173
Remember how stubborn I was?

809
01:00:07,197 --> 01:00:09,492
Well, that hasn't changed.

810
01:00:11,201 --> 01:00:14,121
Take your people and go...

811
01:00:15,747 --> 01:00:19,793
or I swear we'll destroy
every last one of you.

812
01:00:21,128 --> 01:00:23,755
Not Paul.

813
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:26,300
More.

814
01:00:27,968 --> 01:00:32,198
You... will... see.

815
01:00:32,222 --> 01:00:34,033
- See what?

816
01:00:34,057 --> 01:00:37,329
- You will be...

817
01:00:37,353 --> 01:00:40,481
of us.

818
01:00:42,316 --> 01:00:43,709
- Finn to bridge.

819
01:00:43,733 --> 01:00:45,003
Mercer here.

820
01:00:45,027 --> 01:00:47,029
Prepare to release the toxin.

821
01:00:48,697 --> 01:00:51,134
Start with the engineering deck.

822
01:00:51,158 --> 01:00:52,493
Understood.

823
01:01:15,724 --> 01:01:18,310
- We go.

824
01:01:19,436 --> 01:01:20,604
- Thank you.

825
01:01:21,771 --> 01:01:26,151
- Not forever.

Good evening, Dr. Finn.

829
01:02:11,113 --> 01:02:12,573
- Isaac.

830
01:02:13,574 --> 01:02:15,176
What are you doing here?

831
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:17,160
- I am checking on you.

832
01:02:17,994 --> 01:02:18,971
- Excuse me?

833
01:02:18,995 --> 01:02:22,183
- I have observed that
when a crew member aboard the Orville

834
01:02:22,207 --> 01:02:24,143
endures a traumatic occurrence,

835
01:02:24,167 --> 01:02:26,646
other members
of their immediate social construct

836
01:02:26,670 --> 01:02:28,922
inquire how they are doing.

837
01:02:29,965 --> 01:02:30,983
- That's true.

838
01:02:31,007 --> 01:02:32,884
- How are you doing?

839
01:02:34,219 --> 01:02:36,555
- I'm okay.
- Very well.

840
01:02:38,140 --> 01:02:39,182
- Wait.

841
01:02:44,438 --> 01:02:47,833
I hear the Admiralty's suspended

842
01:02:47,857 --> 01:02:51,170
further exploration
of the Naklav Sector for the moment.

843
01:02:51,194 --> 01:02:52,714
- That is correct.

844
01:02:52,738 --> 01:02:54,114
- Probably for the best.

845
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:56,551
- I...

846
01:02:56,575 --> 01:02:59,596
wish to offer my condolences

847
01:02:59,620 --> 01:03:01,622
on the loss of your friend.

848
01:03:02,372 --> 01:03:04,082
- Well, that's very kind of you.

849
01:03:05,125 --> 01:03:07,127
Paul was a special person.

850
01:03:07,877 --> 01:03:11,483
I'm just glad I got to see him
one last time.

851
01:03:11,507 --> 01:03:14,068
- He spoke favorably of you as well.

852
01:03:14,092 --> 01:03:17,572
- You... talked about me? With Paul?

853
01:03:17,596 --> 01:03:21,451
- Our shared history of social
and sexual intimacy with you

854
01:03:21,475 --> 01:03:23,620
provided a common frame of reference.

855
01:03:28,691 --> 01:03:30,669
- Do you know, I have missed you.

856
01:03:30,693 --> 01:03:32,277
- Thank you, Doctor.

857
01:03:34,363 --> 01:03:35,656
- Do you want to sit down?
