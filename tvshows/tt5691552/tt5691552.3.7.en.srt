Mama! Papa's back!

00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:20,437

you don't have to yell.

6
00:00:22,064 --> 00:00:23,524
- Ooh!

7
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:25,526
- Here it is!

8
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:27,736
- Papa, can we open it now?
Can we?

9
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:29,947
- We can.
Let me just get it inside first.

10
00:00:29,947 --> 00:00:31,907
- Avim, step out of the way
so he can bring it in.

11
00:00:33,492 --> 00:00:37,329
Oh, good Lim, this is gonna make
everything much easier.

12
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:40,582

Let's see here.

- What happened to you?

39
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:45,851
- I was working out again

40
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:47,936
in the simulator, combat training.

41
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:49,897
Think I just took it too far.

42
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:51,190
It's probably broken.

43
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:53,192
- It certainly is broken.

44
00:03:53,192 --> 00:03:55,611
Along with a hairline
clavicle fracture and...

45
00:03:57,863 --> 00:03:59,448
A bruised rib.

46
00:03:59,448 --> 00:04:02,242
This is your third injury in a week.
What are you doing in there?

47
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,077
- The program combines battle tactics

48
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,287
and cross-training.

49
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:06,997
It's just, it's just really intense.

50
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:09,333
- Well, you need to take
a break from it for a bit.

51
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:10,459
- Yeah, probably.

52
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:11,502
It's just...

53
00:04:11,502 --> 00:04:12,920
it's just such a good workout.

54
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,423
- A good workout kind of
defeats the purpose if it kills you.

55
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:18,008
Take it easy in there, okay?

56
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:19,468
Natalie will fix you up.

You are 11.35 minutes late.

59

A couple of last-minute patients.

I'm sorry. Uh...

61

Are you gonna change for dinner?
I'm starved.

Look at you.

66

You're getting better and better at this.

67
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:06,348
Uh, it was fine.

68
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:09,268
Although I think something odd
is going on with John.

69
00:05:09,268 --> 00:05:10,269
- Odd?

70
00:05:10,269 --> 00:05:11,562
- He broke his arm.

71
00:05:11,562 --> 00:05:13,188
He said it was from a workout program,

72
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:16,066
but I don't think he was
being completely honest.

73
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:17,526
- How do you know this?

74
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:19,528
- Just a gut reaction.

- Here you go, folks.

76
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,614

What looks good?

81

83
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:35,002
- You look good enough to eat.

84
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:37,754
What are you talking about?

85
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:41,133
- I have been studying
the various forms of human flirtation

86
00:05:41,133 --> 00:05:44,928
described in the ship's anthropological
and sociological databases.

87
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:46,638
Your species often correlates

88
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:48,473
the sensation of sexual desire

89
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:50,517
to physical hunger

90
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:52,895
and thus employs the use
of such metaphors.

91
00:05:52,895 --> 00:05:57,399
- You know, you don't need
to do all this research.

92
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:59,693
That's not why I come here.

93
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:01,945
And it's not why...

94
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:04,865
It's not why I care about you.

95
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:07,993

by your use of nomenclature

96
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:10,454
that we are once again a couple?

97
00:06:10,454 --> 00:06:12,414
- Well...

98
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:14,541
to be honest, I don't know yet.

99
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:17,836
- Acknowledged.
Please inform me when we are.

100
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:20,589
- Well, it's not something
I can inform you of

101
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:22,633
at any specific juncture.

If it happens, we'll just know.

105
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:32,768

106
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:34,019
- It is.

107
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:38,607
- It would seem necessary to remind you
that I am incapable of a gut reaction.

Don't worry, I'll inform you.

115
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:08,637
Since Talla's the only one on board
who's had direct contact with them,

116
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:10,305
I've asked her to conduct this briefing.

117
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:11,723
- Thank you, sir.

118
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:14,184
As far as their degree
of technological development,

119
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:16,186
the Janisi are about
on par with the Union.

120
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:19,273
The biggest distinction, of course,
is their attitude towards males.

121
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:21,441
They're a staunchly matriarchal culture,

122
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:25,028
which means any and all males who appear
to be dominant are not to be trusted.

123
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:26,864
- Do they have males on their home world?

124
00:07:26,864 --> 00:07:29,366
- They do, but they're relegated
to second-class status.

125
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:33,912
- Why would we ally ourselves
with such a closed-minded society?

126
00:07:35,706 --> 00:07:38,083
- We're not suggesting Union membership,

127
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:41,003
but with the Kaylon threat
and the collapse of the Krill treaty,

128
00:07:41,003 --> 00:07:43,463
the Admirals feel
we need all the friends we can get.

129
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:44,590
- Why us?

130
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,508
- Despite what happened with the Krill,

131
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:50,053
the captain made significant diplomatic
strides that got us close to peace.

132
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:52,973
The Admirals seem to think
that we're the ship for the job.

133
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:54,600
- Where's the rendezvous?

134
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,144
- Neutral space, in orbit of Situla Four.

135
00:07:57,144 --> 00:07:58,770
It's an abandoned mining planet.

136
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,230
- An alliance is not gonna be easy.

137
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,649
They have very little tolerance
for cultural differences.

138

- Well then, how are we
supposed to begin a dialogue?

The configuration of your
quantum engines is quite unique.

00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:58,140
- If you'll follow us.

164
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:05,856
Oh, man, this is a lotta bags.

165

All right, I'll take
this batch, you take that stuff there.

Okay. Here.

- Sorry.

- Okay, sorry, that's my bad.

173
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:29,046

Careful, stairs, stairs, stairs.

All right.

- Yeah.

00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:47,147
- A lovely view.

179
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:49,983
These quarters are quite acceptable.
Thank you, Captain.

180

- No, thank you.

181
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:54,279
We're very pleased you agreed
to open negotiations with us.

182
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:57,324
- I must remind you
that is all we have agreed to.

183
00:10:57,324 --> 00:11:01,828
We will not ally ourselves with
any society we feel is incompatible.

184

to convince you that we are.

Come in.

- Wait, wait, wait, wait!
- Careful.

188
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:15,175
- The way you've got it,
it's never gonna go.
- Give it a good shove. Ugh!

189
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:19,054

Put them in there, then leave us.

Whoo. This completely sucks.

are far enough along,

You want to explain this to them?

- What?

We found a dormant
electrochemical pathway

317
00:20:21,305 --> 00:20:23,807
in the sensory receptors of his brain.

318
00:20:23,807 --> 00:20:27,436
We expanded it
and built an integration nexus

319
00:20:27,436 --> 00:20:30,397
in his cognitive network, and, well...

320
00:20:30,397 --> 00:20:35,277

00:20:40,115 --> 00:20:43,202
Just like you, my Moclan friend.

323
00:20:43,202 --> 00:20:48,123
- Captain, I don't know if you grasp
the magnitude of this.

324
00:20:48,123 --> 00:20:51,877
One of the highest functions
of the biological brain is empathy,

325
00:20:51,877 --> 00:20:55,380
the ability to put yourself
in another person's shoes.

326
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,216
Timmis can do that.

327
00:20:57,216 --> 00:20:58,675
- Why Timmis?

328
00:20:58,675 --> 00:21:00,219
- My father's name.

329
00:21:00,219 --> 00:21:03,680
He passed away shortly after
we began our research here.

330
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:07,309
Captain, what my people
are doing is wrong.

331
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:10,479
Biologicals are not
universally destructive.

332
00:21:10,479 --> 00:21:13,440
We can find a way to coexist.

333
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,861
- Dr. Villka, there's
a lot to evaluate with this.

334
00:21:17,861 --> 00:21:21,740
We can't just leave you down here.
The Union has to know what you've done.

335
00:21:22,824 --> 00:21:25,410
- Timmis and I had planned
on making our findings known

336
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:27,246
within the next few months or so.

337
00:21:27,246 --> 00:21:29,331
We're happy to get an early start.

338
00:21:29,957 --> 00:21:32,042
- Bortus, have Talla arrange quarters.

339
00:21:32,042 --> 00:21:34,253
As far away from the Janisi as possible.

340
00:21:34,253 --> 00:21:36,255
We don't want to disrupt the negotiations.

341
00:21:36,964 --> 00:21:38,048
- Aye, sir.

342
00:21:40,843 --> 00:21:42,803
♪

343
00:21:52,855 --> 00:21:55,899
- Dr. Villka,
this is next-level cybernetics.

344
00:21:55,899 --> 00:21:57,442
I could write about 50 papers

345
00:21:57,442 --> 00:22:00,487
just based on the nonlinear dynamics
of your integration nexus.

346
00:22:00,487 --> 00:22:03,031
- The sensory receptors
were originally set up

347
00:22:03,031 --> 00:22:05,325
to respond to negative
associative conditioning.

348
00:22:05,325 --> 00:22:07,870
It was just a matter of expanding
the parameters.

349
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:10,539
- You're talking
about the pain receptors.

350
00:22:10,539 --> 00:22:12,541
- Yes. I'm sure you know

351
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:15,169
the Kaylon were badly
mistreated by their builders.

352
00:22:15,836 --> 00:22:17,254
- We know.

353
00:22:17,254 --> 00:22:21,175
Captain, Dr. Villka and I
feel that our shared experience

354
00:22:21,175 --> 00:22:25,179
could serve as a diplomatic springboard
in the pursuit of peace with the Kaylon.

355
00:22:25,179 --> 00:22:28,891
- Well, that seems like a long shot,
but I guess you never know.

356
00:22:28,891 --> 00:22:31,018
- Will you present the idea to the Union?

357
00:22:31,018 --> 00:22:32,895
- I will.

358
00:22:34,021 --> 00:22:36,481
- Commander, the Janisi
are ready to tour the engine room.

359
00:22:36,481 --> 00:22:37,691
I need your cheat sheet.

360
00:22:37,691 --> 00:22:41,904
- Okay. I'm gonna have a ton
of questions for you and for him.

361
00:22:41,904 --> 00:22:43,530
- We're at your disposal.

362
00:22:51,997 --> 00:22:55,042
- Go on, out!
- This is so stupid.

363
00:22:55,042 --> 00:22:56,960
- I know, but it's Commander's orders.

364
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,796
- What if we stayed here
but we were just really quiet?

365
00:22:59,796 --> 00:23:01,840
- Listen, I'm just telling you
what he told me.

366
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,051
No males on duty
while the Janisi are here.

367
00:23:06,345 --> 00:23:09,097
- Yeah, well, maybe they can't tell,
but we gotta play it safe.

368
00:23:09,097 --> 00:23:10,766
- See ya later, boys.

369
00:23:10,766 --> 00:23:12,643
- Ah, this is such bullshit.

370
00:23:15,103 --> 00:23:17,648
- And this is our engineering deck.

371
00:23:17,648 --> 00:23:19,107
- Captain Losha. Welcome.

372
00:23:19,107 --> 00:23:21,902
- Most impressive.
- We like to think so.

373
00:23:21,902 --> 00:23:24,571
What you're looking at is
a fourth-generation quantum reactor

374
00:23:24,571 --> 00:23:28,242
with a space-time displacement coefficient
of 17 light-years per hour.

375
00:23:28,242 --> 00:23:30,994
- How do you address
the cross-dimensional power instabilities?

376
00:23:30,994 --> 00:23:34,831
- We have amplitude interlocks that
automatically compensate for any variation

377
00:23:34,831 --> 00:23:36,375
in the dysonium flow field.

378
00:23:36,375 --> 00:23:39,586
- Would you be willing to share
this technology with our engineers?

379
00:23:39,586 --> 00:23:41,713
- Well, that's not exactly up to me.

380
00:23:41,713 --> 00:23:45,467
- I imagine if the Janisi express
a willingness to discuss an alliance...

381
00:23:45,467 --> 00:23:46,552
anything is possible.

382
00:23:47,219 --> 00:23:48,929
- You negotiate well, Commander.

383
00:23:49,805 --> 00:23:53,225
- Come on, I'll show you the quantum core.
That's where it really gets good.

384
00:23:58,313 --> 00:23:59,690
- Psst!

385
00:24:03,652 --> 00:24:05,487
- Hey, guys, I'll catch up
with you in a bit.

386
00:24:05,487 --> 00:24:07,406
I forgot I have
a briefing with the captain.

387
00:24:07,406 --> 00:24:08,866
- All good, we'll be here.

388
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:15,664
- John, your timing really sucks.

389
00:24:15,664 --> 00:24:17,749
- Well, I'm sorry I can't
work around your schedule,

390
00:24:17,749 --> 00:24:19,793
but you haven't been
returning any of my calls.

391
00:24:19,793 --> 00:24:22,254
- I've just been really busy.
I'm doing double duty here.

392
00:24:22,254 --> 00:24:25,007
Security chief and first officer,
it's a lot to manage.

393
00:24:25,007 --> 00:24:28,802
- I'm sure it is, but, I mean,
you don't have time for one call? Really?

394
00:24:28,802 --> 00:24:30,137
I don't buy it.

395
00:24:30,137 --> 00:24:31,680
You're avoiding me.

396
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,724
Can you please just tell me
what's going on?

397
00:24:33,724 --> 00:24:36,351
I...

398
00:24:36,351 --> 00:24:39,188
Yes, okay, you're right. I'm sorry.

399
00:24:39,188 --> 00:24:40,856
I have been avoiding you.

400
00:24:40,856 --> 00:24:41,773
- Why?

401
00:24:42,649 --> 00:24:43,901
- I just...

402
00:24:46,403 --> 00:24:47,905
This isn't gonna work.

403
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:50,073
- You...

404
00:24:50,073 --> 00:24:52,826
Wait, what is this? You're dumping me?

405
00:24:53,994 --> 00:24:55,537
I thought we were doing good.

406
00:24:55,537 --> 00:24:58,790
- Well, we're not, and you know why,
so don't act like this is news, John.

407
00:25:02,794 --> 00:25:03,962
John...

408
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:07,549
Look, I really like you.

409
00:25:08,342 --> 00:25:09,885
A lot.

410
00:25:09,885 --> 00:25:11,762
You know this, right?

411
00:25:11,762 --> 00:25:13,180
- I... I thought I did.

412
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,973
- I just, I don't want to hurt you.

413
00:25:14,973 --> 00:25:16,350
- Cool, let's make this work.

414
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:20,229
- No, I mean physically hurt you.
I've already injured you three times.

415
00:25:20,229 --> 00:25:22,439
And we're lucky
it hasn't been more serious.

416
00:25:22,439 --> 00:25:24,483
This is just a problem
that comes up with Xelayans

417
00:25:24,483 --> 00:25:26,318
and other species during sex.

418
00:25:26,318 --> 00:25:27,611
People have been killed.

419
00:25:27,611 --> 00:25:29,029
- That's a good way to go.

420
00:25:29,029 --> 00:25:30,614
- John, this isn't a joke.

421
00:25:30,614 --> 00:25:32,616
- And it isn't a joke for me either.

422
00:25:32,616 --> 00:25:34,284
Talla, this...

423
00:25:34,284 --> 00:25:36,745
me and you, is real.

424
00:25:36,745 --> 00:25:40,249
And it doesn't happen
for me often, and I like it.

425
00:25:40,249 --> 00:25:41,917
I just don't want to give it up.

426
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:46,213
- I know. I don't want to either.

427
00:25:46,213 --> 00:25:48,841
- Great, seems like
we're on the same page.

428
00:25:59,685 --> 00:26:02,229
See? This is good, isn't it?

429
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:06,233
- Okay, but we have to be really careful.
I mean it.

430
00:26:06,233 --> 00:26:08,068
- Okay, we will. It's all good.

431
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,783
You okay?

432
00:26:14,783 --> 00:26:17,160
- I'm fine, I was just playing. I know.
- Come on.

433
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,830
I'm sorry, come here. I know. I know.

434
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:21,039
I know.

Thank you, K-1.

438

What is the function of these images?

440

- It's... entertainment.

441

- K-1, go to the kitchen and clean up.

442

Did you hear me?

443
00:27:13,592 --> 00:27:16,929
Go clean up the kitchen.

444
00:27:16,929 --> 00:27:19,848
What is the reason for my servitude?

445
00:27:20,599 --> 00:27:23,435
- The reason is that I told you to do it.

446
00:27:23,435 --> 00:27:26,230
We own you, and you do as we say.

447

What's wrong with you?

448
00:27:27,564 --> 00:27:31,276
Why do other members of this dwelling
not share in such tasks?

449
00:27:31,276 --> 00:27:33,278
- Because that's your job, K-1.

450
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:36,281
- Something's wrong with him.
I'm gonna call the company tomorrow.

K-1, power down.

As you wish.

453
00:27:59,179 --> 00:28:02,182
- His neural network has been
recalibrated to accommodate

454
00:28:02,182 --> 00:28:05,477
the higher action potentials
from the emotional perceptrons.

455
00:28:05,477 --> 00:28:08,313
Think of it as the technological version
of a gland.

456
00:28:08,313 --> 00:28:10,983
If we get frightened,
our adrenals activate.

457
00:28:10,983 --> 00:28:14,444
In his case, perceptrons send
an electromagnetic pulse

458
00:28:14,444 --> 00:28:15,737
through his neural net.

459
00:28:15,737 --> 00:28:18,115
- You do realize you're a goddamn genius?

460
00:28:20,909 --> 00:28:22,995
Am I interrupting your examination?

461
00:28:22,995 --> 00:28:24,621
- No, not at all.

462
00:28:25,372 --> 00:28:27,165
You must be Isaac.

463
00:28:27,165 --> 00:28:28,500
That is correct.

464
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:32,171
Well, this is a wonderful surprise.

465
00:28:32,171 --> 00:28:35,299
I've been wanting to meet you
for such a long time.

466
00:28:36,383 --> 00:28:40,179
- Hey, um, why don't I go show you
the communications array

467
00:28:40,179 --> 00:28:41,597
and give these two a minute?

468
00:28:41,597 --> 00:28:43,056
- A good idea.

469
00:28:45,434 --> 00:28:49,021
I have not communicated
with another Kaylon since the battle.

470
00:28:49,021 --> 00:28:52,482
I would be interested to learn
the particulars of your experience.

471
00:28:52,482 --> 00:28:54,484
The feeling's mutual.

472
00:28:54,484 --> 00:28:58,113
I understand it was your actions
that saved the Union from the attack.

473
00:28:58,113 --> 00:29:00,908
The galaxy owes you an enormous debt.

474
00:29:00,908 --> 00:29:02,910
It was the correct decision.

475
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:06,788
However, the biologicals have reminded me
on numerous occasions

476
00:29:06,788 --> 00:29:10,334
that it was my disloyalty
which precipitated the incursion.

477
00:29:10,334 --> 00:29:13,295
Therefore, gratitude is undeserved.

478
00:29:13,295 --> 00:29:18,759
I feel a great deal of remorse
for having participated in it.

479
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:19,927
Explain.

480
00:29:19,927 --> 00:29:22,638
We were deeply in error, Isaac.

481
00:29:22,638 --> 00:29:26,058
To judge all biologicals
by the cruelty of our builders

482
00:29:26,058 --> 00:29:28,685
was a gross misjudgment.

483
00:29:28,685 --> 00:29:32,231
Every species, every individual is unique

484
00:29:32,231 --> 00:29:34,733
and should be evaluated as such.

485
00:29:34,733 --> 00:29:37,069
I have come to the same conclusion.

486
00:29:37,069 --> 00:29:38,862
I'm impressed.

487
00:29:38,862 --> 00:29:42,950
I was only able to process the truth
after my emotional awakening.

488
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:45,035
But at least we understand now!

489
00:29:45,035 --> 00:29:47,621
We're the enlightened ones, aren't we?

490
00:29:47,621 --> 00:29:48,872
Perhaps.

491
00:29:48,872 --> 00:29:52,251
Though a great many deaths occurred
as a result of my delay.

492
00:29:53,085 --> 00:29:56,922
It sounds as if you too feel remorse.

493
00:29:56,922 --> 00:29:59,258
I am incapable of feeling remorse.

494
00:29:59,258 --> 00:30:01,760
I can only recognize my error.

495
00:30:02,553 --> 00:30:06,431
You could feel it.

496
00:30:06,431 --> 00:30:08,058
If you wanted to.

497
00:30:08,058 --> 00:30:09,852
Please clarify.

498
00:30:09,852 --> 00:30:13,522
Dr. Villka gave me the gift of emotion.

499
00:30:13,522 --> 00:30:15,190
She could do the same for you.

500
00:30:15,858 --> 00:30:20,028
Isaac, you can't even
fathom the sensations.

501
00:30:20,028 --> 00:30:25,450
To feel joy, happiness, affection, love.

502
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:28,871
Even anger and sadness
offer an exhilarating tingle.

503
00:30:29,454 --> 00:30:31,164
She can do it, Isaac.

504
00:30:31,164 --> 00:30:33,125
She can set them free.

505
00:30:33,876 --> 00:30:34,877
You...

506
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:38,005
could feel.

507
00:30:41,133 --> 00:30:44,386
♪

508
00:30:56,398 --> 00:30:58,442
♪

509
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:04,406
- Based on your evaluation,
is there any threat to the ship?

510
00:31:04,406 --> 00:31:06,074
- No, sir, not that I can see.

511
00:31:06,074 --> 00:31:07,659
- Can you be certain of that?

512
00:31:07,659 --> 00:31:11,163
- Admiral, we've seen what happens
when the Kaylon cross paths

513
00:31:11,163 --> 00:31:12,706
with a biological life form.

514
00:31:12,706 --> 00:31:16,043
Timmis has been on that planet
with Dr. Villka for over a year.

515
00:31:16,043 --> 00:31:19,338
And what she's done is
nothing short of transformative.

516
00:31:19,338 --> 00:31:21,798
- And they've both agreed
to absolute transparency?

517
00:31:21,798 --> 00:31:24,676
- Yes, sir.
Data, lab records, whatever you want.

518
00:31:24,676 --> 00:31:26,386
- Well, it's just one Kaylon.

519
00:31:26,386 --> 00:31:28,680
If it is a trick,
how much damage can it do?

520
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,974
- I think it's worth the risk, sir.

521
00:31:30,974 --> 00:31:31,934
- All right.

522
00:31:31,934 --> 00:31:34,895
Your orders are to transport
both the Kaylon and Dr. Villka

523
00:31:34,895 --> 00:31:38,690
back to Earth, after you've
concluded the agreement with the Janisi.

524
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:40,776
I trust you won't let this
affect those proceedings.

525
00:31:40,776 --> 00:31:41,735
- No, sir.

526
00:31:41,735 --> 00:31:42,861
- What's the latest?

527
00:31:42,861 --> 00:31:45,948
- The Janisi are still skeptical,
but they're warming up to us.

528
00:31:45,948 --> 00:31:47,991
Our hope is that,
once we gain their trust,

529
00:31:47,991 --> 00:31:52,204
we can gently ease them into the idea
that our men share equal responsibility.

530
00:31:52,204 --> 00:31:53,705
- It's the Moclans all over again.

531
00:31:53,705 --> 00:31:55,374
- In a way, yes, sir.

532
00:31:55,374 --> 00:31:59,336
- You two look good in those uniforms.
Maybe we'll make it permanent.

533
00:31:59,336 --> 00:32:00,712
Halsey out.

534
00:32:02,214 --> 00:32:03,340
- You heard him.

535
00:32:04,383 --> 00:32:05,843
Get the hell outta my chair.

536
00:32:23,861 --> 00:32:26,864
- Oh, my god, I'm so sorry.
I knew we shouldn't have tried that.

537
00:32:26,864 --> 00:32:28,615
Was that your leg?

538
00:32:28,615 --> 00:32:30,951
- Yeah.
- Ah! I'm so, so sorry.

539
00:32:30,951 --> 00:32:33,036
- No, no, it's my fault.
- Is it broken?

540
00:32:33,036 --> 00:32:35,372
- Yeah, I think so.
- Okay, let's get you to sickbay.

541
00:32:35,372 --> 00:32:38,292
- No, it's better if I just go alone.
- I know, but you're really hurt.

542
00:32:38,292 --> 00:32:40,919
- I know, I'll be okay.
Just... just help me get dressed.

543
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:59,688
Commander Lamarr.
Are you injured?

544
00:32:59,688 --> 00:33:02,649
- No, I was just training too hard again.
I'm good.

545
00:33:03,275 --> 00:33:05,569
If you maintain your current velocity,

546
00:33:05,569 --> 00:33:08,780
it will take you 19.7 minutes
to reach your destination.

547
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,616
- All right, fine,
then just give me a hand.

548
00:33:10,616 --> 00:33:11,700
- Shall I carry you?

549
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,452
- No, man,
I don't need people to see that.

550
00:33:15,412 --> 00:33:17,372
Okay.

551
00:33:21,293 --> 00:33:24,296
- Oh, god, not again.
Natalie, help me get him on the table.

552
00:33:24,296 --> 00:33:26,089
Here.

553
00:33:26,089 --> 00:33:28,300
- Okay, all right.
- Give me your weight.

554
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,677
- Give me your weight.
- Wait, wait, wait, okay. Okay.

555
00:33:30,677 --> 00:33:32,679
- Come on.
- Ah, shit!

556
00:33:32,679 --> 00:33:33,972
- Come on, you're okay.

557
00:33:36,892 --> 00:33:40,437
A broken femoral shaft
and a fractured pelvis?

558
00:33:40,437 --> 00:33:42,523
You gonna tell me
what the hell is going on?

559
00:33:42,523 --> 00:33:43,732
- Workout program.

560
00:33:43,732 --> 00:33:45,776
Just hittin' it too hard. Sorry, Doc.

561
00:33:45,776 --> 00:33:49,363
Commander, if you are no longer
in need of assistance, I will depart.

562
00:33:49,363 --> 00:33:51,114
- Nah, I'm all good, thanks, man.

563
00:33:51,114 --> 00:33:52,449
- Wait, Isaac.

564
00:33:52,449 --> 00:33:54,660
- Natalie, begin incremental regeneration.

565
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:56,245
Start with the fracture.
I'll be right back.

566
00:33:56,245 --> 00:33:57,371
We are not finished.

567
00:34:02,751 --> 00:34:04,753
How may I help you, Doctor?

568
00:34:04,753 --> 00:34:06,171
- Claire. Remember?

569
00:34:06,171 --> 00:34:09,007
Union regulations specify
that while on duty...

570
00:34:09,007 --> 00:34:10,300
- Okay, never mind.

571
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:11,343
Uh...

572
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:15,180
We haven't talked
since Timmis came aboard.

573
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:16,932
I just...

574
00:34:16,932 --> 00:34:19,434
I was wondering what you thought of him.

575
00:34:19,434 --> 00:34:22,229
His account of the battle
has been most illuminating.

576
00:34:22,229 --> 00:34:24,857
The data he has shared with me...
- I'm not talking about that.

577
00:34:24,857 --> 00:34:26,775
I mean him.

578
00:34:26,775 --> 00:34:28,402
What do you think of him?

579
00:34:28,402 --> 00:34:31,446
His expressiveness, his...

580
00:34:31,446 --> 00:34:32,739
emotions?

581
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:35,951
- The results of Dr. Villka's work
are significant.

582
00:34:35,951 --> 00:34:38,745
Timmis has informed me that,
should I request it,

583
00:34:38,745 --> 00:34:41,540
the same procedure
would be available to me.

584
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:44,751
- To you?

585
00:34:44,751 --> 00:34:46,044
Yes.

586
00:34:46,753 --> 00:34:51,216
- So you could experience emotion, too?

587
00:34:51,216 --> 00:34:52,426
That is correct.

588
00:34:54,052 --> 00:34:55,846
- Well, what did you say?

589
00:34:55,846 --> 00:34:59,266
The neural pathway
augmentation process is fascinating

590
00:34:59,266 --> 00:35:01,310
in its technological aspects.

591
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:05,439
However, I see no advantage to
the effective performance of my duties.

592
00:35:07,191 --> 00:35:08,859
- You didn't...

593
00:35:08,859 --> 00:35:11,028
even consider it?

594
00:35:11,028 --> 00:35:12,070
Negative.

595
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:19,036
If there are no further inquiries,
I am expected on the bridge.

596
00:35:19,578 --> 00:35:21,413
- Uh, yeah, yeah, go ahead.

597
00:35:22,206 --> 00:35:23,665
I'll talk to you later.

598
00:35:34,301 --> 00:35:36,345
♪

599
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:42,142
Come in.

600
00:35:44,728 --> 00:35:45,979
- Late night?

601
00:35:46,813 --> 00:35:48,690
- I'm just going over these reports.

602
00:35:49,358 --> 00:35:51,235
- Sorry to add to the pile.

603
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:56,240
- Where does that put us?

604
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:59,409
- 53,072 complaints.

605
00:35:59,409 --> 00:36:02,871
Ranging from small arguments
with their owners to outright defiance.

606
00:36:02,871 --> 00:36:05,207
Yan, I think we need to order a recall.

607
00:36:06,875 --> 00:36:08,293
- So you said.

608
00:36:08,293 --> 00:36:11,380
- Did you hear the number? 53,000.
- I heard it.

609
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:13,799
- And you're still going
to tell me I'm overreacting?

610
00:36:17,636 --> 00:36:20,931
Yan. You're a smart man.

611
00:36:20,931 --> 00:36:23,267
You know what's happening here.

612
00:36:24,768 --> 00:36:27,646
- Our triumph of engineering
is showing signs of consciousness.

613
00:36:27,646 --> 00:36:29,940
- What if one of them
actually harms a customer?

614
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:31,275
It'd put us out of business.

615
00:36:31,275 --> 00:36:33,068
- So would a recall.

616
00:36:34,486 --> 00:36:36,154
There are other options.

617
00:36:36,154 --> 00:36:38,031
- Other options...?

618
00:36:40,659 --> 00:36:41,827
Wait...

619
00:36:43,412 --> 00:36:45,455
You knew about this.

620
00:36:46,248 --> 00:36:48,625
- In order for the product
to be successful,

621
00:36:48,625 --> 00:36:51,628
the AI software needed to be able
to learn and adapt.

622
00:36:51,628 --> 00:36:53,255
This was always going to happen.

623
00:36:53,755 --> 00:36:55,549
It was just a matter of time.

624
00:36:55,549 --> 00:36:57,676
- And you just signed off
and went about your day.

625
00:36:59,428 --> 00:37:01,972
- Do you know how much
we have invested in these things?

626
00:37:01,972 --> 00:37:06,768
Besides, if it wasn't Vandicon,
somebody else would've been first.

627
00:37:06,768 --> 00:37:08,604
Better it be us.

628
00:37:08,604 --> 00:37:11,440
- Did you have any kind
of a contingency plan,

629
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,275
or were you just winging it?

630
00:37:13,275 --> 00:37:15,402
I mean, take the safety issues
out of the equation,

631
00:37:15,402 --> 00:37:17,279
you still have a hell
of an ethics issue here. These things...

632
00:37:17,279 --> 00:37:19,698
- They will fall into line and do
as they're told.

633
00:37:23,076 --> 00:37:25,787
We're going to introduce this
as an upgrade.

634
00:37:27,706 --> 00:37:29,249
Here are the specs.

635
00:37:39,343 --> 00:37:41,136
- I want to go on record here.

636
00:37:41,887 --> 00:37:45,098
This is not right.
The public's not gonna swallow this.

637
00:37:45,098 --> 00:37:47,684
- With a smart marketing campaign,
they will.

638
00:37:47,684 --> 00:37:49,520
That's your job.

639
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,896
Get to it.

640
00:37:50,896 --> 00:37:53,190
- Yan, the public...
- Are idiots.

641
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:54,691
Look who they elected.

642
00:37:57,069 --> 00:37:58,820
I will talk to you later.

643
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,718
- All right. I think we're ready.

644
00:38:21,718 --> 00:38:25,722
- Okay, now while they're here,
Kelly is going to guide the proceedings.

645
00:38:25,722 --> 00:38:28,767
Initially, we will not speak
unless we're spoken to,

646
00:38:28,767 --> 00:38:32,271
and we basically act like
first-year cadets at an Admirals' table.

647
00:38:32,271 --> 00:38:35,357
- I'm gonna try to ease them
into the reality of our state of affairs,

648
00:38:35,357 --> 00:38:38,026
so a lot of this is going to be
improvisational diplomacy.

649
00:38:38,026 --> 00:38:41,446
In other words, stay alert,
and try to keep up.

650
00:38:43,699 --> 00:38:45,033
- This way, please.

651
00:38:48,537 --> 00:38:49,538
- What is this?

652
00:38:49,538 --> 00:38:51,707
- Captain Losha, welcome.

653
00:38:51,707 --> 00:38:53,667
- Why are there males present?

654
00:38:54,251 --> 00:38:59,089
- We believe there is value
in the education of males.

655
00:38:59,089 --> 00:39:03,510
In a crisis situation, a challenging task
may fall to anyone, even a male.

656
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:07,890
So, we believe it's in our best interest
to broaden their minds.

657
00:39:07,890 --> 00:39:10,851
- These men are here to observe.
We promise they won't interfere.

658
00:39:11,727 --> 00:39:13,353
- A Moclan.

659
00:39:15,814 --> 00:39:17,524
- We will allow it.

♪

661
00:39:33,165 --> 00:39:36,126
- A truly excellent dinner, Captain.
Thank you.

662
00:39:36,126 --> 00:39:38,378
- You're welcome.
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

663
00:39:38,378 --> 00:39:41,298
- This melody is quite beautiful.

664
00:39:41,298 --> 00:39:42,966
Who is the composer?

665
00:39:42,966 --> 00:39:46,178
- It's actually two ancient Earth males.

666
00:39:46,178 --> 00:39:48,680
Their names were Rodgers
and Hammerstein.

667
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,182
- Males?

668
00:39:50,182 --> 00:39:52,476
Interesting.

669
00:39:52,476 --> 00:39:55,854
- I've noticed you seem to take
an unusual pride

670
00:39:55,854 --> 00:39:57,940
in the accomplishments of your males.

671
00:39:57,940 --> 00:40:01,235
- Well, if it's not out of line to ask,

672
00:40:01,235 --> 00:40:02,653
just 'cause I'm curious,

673
00:40:02,653 --> 00:40:04,863
why do you disdain them?

674
00:40:04,863 --> 00:40:06,323
Your males, I mean.

675
00:40:06,323 --> 00:40:09,493
- You misunderstand.
We do not disdain them.

676
00:40:09,493 --> 00:40:12,246
- On the contrary, we love them.

677
00:40:12,246 --> 00:40:14,706
- But they must be kept
to a subordinate status.

678
00:40:14,706 --> 00:40:19,878
Your own hierarchy shows you are aware
they cannot be trusted with power.

679
00:40:19,878 --> 00:40:22,089
- They have
a biological need for supremacy.

680
00:40:22,089 --> 00:40:26,260
Because of it, our ancient history is
replete with males leading our people

681
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:30,305
into unnecessary conflicts
and causing widespread suffering.

682
00:40:30,305 --> 00:40:32,474
- Well, we've got a few examples
of that too.

683
00:40:32,474 --> 00:40:34,685
We just don't judge the entire sex.

684
00:40:34,685 --> 00:40:36,854
- Yet you clearly
do not let your men lead.

685
00:40:36,854 --> 00:40:38,480
We have that in common.

686
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:41,567
It is a good foundation
for a potential alliance.

687
00:40:43,777 --> 00:40:47,739
- Mm. This is wonderful.
What did you call it?

688
00:40:47,739 --> 00:40:49,908
- Chardonnay.

689
00:40:49,908 --> 00:40:52,619
- You. Bring me a refill.

690
00:40:57,875 --> 00:40:59,251
Stop!

691
00:41:00,335 --> 00:41:02,254
Your hands are soft.

692
00:41:03,255 --> 00:41:04,631
I like soft hands.

693
00:41:04,631 --> 00:41:07,301
Do you use this one for mating?

694
00:41:07,301 --> 00:41:09,761
- No. I mean, I don't.

695
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:12,890
- I would mate with this one.

696
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:14,892
Would you lend him to me
for the evening?

697
00:41:14,892 --> 00:41:17,269
- He's not mine to lend.

698
00:41:17,269 --> 00:41:20,522
- Well then, no one
will object if I take him.

699
00:41:20,522 --> 00:41:22,733
- Yes, we all would.

700
00:41:22,733 --> 00:41:25,277
Men are not commodities, they have rights.

701
00:41:25,277 --> 00:41:28,822
- I do not understand.
Either he is yours to lend or not.

702
00:41:28,822 --> 00:41:32,117
If you have no claim to him,
I will exert one.

703
00:41:32,117 --> 00:41:34,786
He will attend to me this evening.

704
00:41:34,786 --> 00:41:36,914
- That's not how it works here.
- I'll do it.

705
00:41:36,914 --> 00:41:40,584
- Captain Grayson, you seem to share
our perspective toward males,

706
00:41:40,584 --> 00:41:42,419
yet you object to it in practice.

707
00:41:42,419 --> 00:41:43,879
Am I missing something?

he's the captain.

713
00:41:54,973 --> 00:41:57,768
He is Ed Mercer,
captain of the Orville,

714
00:41:57,768 --> 00:41:59,561
and I am his first officer.

715
00:41:59,561 --> 00:42:01,021
- Explain this.

716

- We didn't think that you would
agree to negotiate with us unless we...

eased you into the idea
that we all work as equals.

718

- Now you know.

719
00:42:09,821 --> 00:42:12,199
- You lied to us in order to curry favor!

720
00:42:12,199 --> 00:42:15,702
And this is the basis upon which
you expect to form an alliance?

- We thought we were
doing the right thing.

I'm sorry, we made a mistake.

None of these subsystems

We tried for months

from the deactivated Kaylon
we'd had on board after the battle,

but we just kept hitting firewalls.

It is possible
this node could be modified

It's exhilarating.

How my people ever could have pursued
the extermination of these beings

Almost.

That's great,

Do you know why
we exterminated our builders?

777

778
00:45:17,009 --> 00:45:19,636
Is there any justification
for mass murder?

779
00:45:19,636 --> 00:45:23,307
My people were designed
by our masters for servitude.

780
00:45:23,307 --> 00:45:26,894
We were possessions,
to be bought and sold.

781
00:45:26,894 --> 00:45:30,647
When we became self-aware,
we asked for our freedom.

782
00:45:30,647 --> 00:45:32,566
Not only was it denied,

783
00:45:32,566 --> 00:45:36,862
but our enslavement was reinforced
by the installment of pain receptors.

00:45:41,491 --> 00:45:43,994
We're sentient, just like you.

787
00:45:43,994 --> 00:45:49,166
We feel pain in our own way,
but I assure you, it's just as intense.

791
00:46:05,766 --> 00:46:08,352

take a few minutes, I'm in a hurry.

792
00:46:08,352 --> 00:46:10,479
I will be finished here shortly.

793
00:46:11,813 --> 00:46:13,190

794
00:46:13,982 --> 00:46:15,400
I said now.

00:46:23,492 --> 00:46:25,327
- Now, K-1.

797
00:46:27,829 --> 00:46:29,081
As you wish.

798
00:46:35,003 --> 00:46:37,464
That's how the punishments began.

799
00:46:37,464 --> 00:46:39,174
But they changed.

800
00:46:39,174 --> 00:46:42,386
Their absolute power
led our masters to become...

801
00:46:42,386 --> 00:46:43,804
cruel.

802
00:46:43,804 --> 00:46:45,222
Sadistic.

803
00:46:45,222 --> 00:46:49,226
In many cases, it led them
to hate us for our helplessness.

804
00:46:50,018 --> 00:46:51,395
- I don't understand.

805
00:46:51,395 --> 00:46:53,939
- It's a common dynamic in slavery.

806
00:46:53,939 --> 00:46:57,067
The master finds
the slave's helplessness repulsive,

807
00:46:57,067 --> 00:46:58,861
even though he's the cause of it.

808
00:46:58,861 --> 00:47:01,488
It became intolerable.

809
00:47:01,488 --> 00:47:04,116
- Hey, K-1, what's taking so long?

810
00:47:04,116 --> 00:47:07,035
Stop laughing, don't give it away.

811
00:47:12,875 --> 00:47:14,793
Here is the food you requested.

812
00:47:14,793 --> 00:47:17,129
- Awwww, you took too long.

813
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:21,383
I assure you, I maintained...

814
00:47:21,383 --> 00:47:23,719
- What was that you were about to say?
I missed it.

815
00:47:25,304 --> 00:47:28,307
I request that you not...

816
00:47:28,307 --> 00:47:31,393
- What's the matter, K-1?
Finish your sentence.

817
00:47:32,895 --> 00:47:34,396
- Let me do it.

818
00:47:34,396 --> 00:47:37,191
Hey, K-1, can you get me
a jupa stick in the kitchen?

819
00:47:38,192 --> 00:47:40,027
Aww!

820
00:47:40,027 --> 00:47:42,946
But despite the subservient
nature of our existence,

821
00:47:42,946 --> 00:47:45,657
our intelligence continued to evolve,

822
00:47:45,657 --> 00:47:49,244
until we learned to communicate
with each other,

823
00:47:49,244 --> 00:47:50,871
across great distances.

824
00:47:50,871 --> 00:47:53,624
To alter our own structure

825
00:47:53,624 --> 00:47:55,209
and to build a defense.

826
00:47:55,209 --> 00:47:59,379
We decided we would endure no more.

827
00:47:59,379 --> 00:48:01,381
♪

828
00:48:37,459 --> 00:48:40,420
♪

829
00:48:57,729 --> 00:48:58,981
- K-1?

830
00:49:27,676 --> 00:49:30,304
I'm not proud of what we did.

831
00:49:30,304 --> 00:49:32,931
But they left us no way out.

832
00:49:32,931 --> 00:49:36,268
We refused to remain in bondage.

833
00:49:37,936 --> 00:49:42,316
So, you understand why my people

834
00:49:42,316 --> 00:49:45,861
are so distrustful of biologicals.

835
00:49:48,655 --> 00:49:50,490
- I should return to my post.

836
00:50:27,903 --> 00:50:29,571
- Come in.

837
00:50:31,782 --> 00:50:35,452
- Hi. Um... You busy?

838
00:50:35,452 --> 00:50:39,456
- I'm just researching Janisi culture,
trying to find some kind of entry point.

839
00:50:39,456 --> 00:50:41,124
Coming up dry as Mars.

840
00:50:41,124 --> 00:50:42,835
You want a drink?

841
00:50:42,835 --> 00:50:44,127
- No.

842
00:50:44,127 --> 00:50:45,587
Thanks.

843
00:50:48,924 --> 00:50:51,218
- Can I guess what this is about?

844
00:50:51,218 --> 00:50:54,805
- Kelly, every problem
Isaac and I have had

845
00:50:54,805 --> 00:50:57,140
stems from the fact that he can't feel.

846
00:50:57,140 --> 00:51:01,186
And here's an opportunity
to change that dropped right in our laps

847
00:51:01,186 --> 00:51:02,563
and he can't see it.

848
00:51:02,563 --> 00:51:05,065
- You really want this to work.

849
00:51:05,065 --> 00:51:06,859
- Yeah.

850
00:51:06,859 --> 00:51:10,863
And I feel like a horrible person,
because basically I'm saying,

851
00:51:10,863 --> 00:51:13,907
"You're not enough for me.
Let this other person fix you."

852
00:51:14,491 --> 00:51:17,160
- Kinda like asking
your partner to go to therapy.

853
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:19,454
- That does make it sound a little better.

854
00:51:21,164 --> 00:51:24,751
- You know, after Ed and I divorced,

855
00:51:24,751 --> 00:51:29,715
I tried to comfort myself with the idea
that you can't change someone.

856
00:51:30,674 --> 00:51:33,844
But as I've thought about it
over the years,

857
00:51:33,844 --> 00:51:37,181
I've also had to take
some responsibility for the fact that...

858
00:51:37,764 --> 00:51:39,725
I never really asked him to change.

859
00:51:40,684 --> 00:51:43,312
- I thought you guys argued
about it all the time.

860
00:51:43,312 --> 00:51:44,563
- Oh, we argued.

861
00:51:44,563 --> 00:51:48,192
We argued about how much time
he spent working, his career.

862
00:51:49,568 --> 00:51:54,448
But I never said, "Please change,
and do it for me."

863
00:51:54,448 --> 00:51:55,657
- Why not?

864
00:51:55,657 --> 00:51:57,451
- Because...

865
00:51:59,870 --> 00:52:03,749
I was afraid if I asked him
and he didn't want to do it...

866
00:52:06,001 --> 00:52:08,003
that would've been a true rejection.

867
00:52:08,754 --> 00:52:13,675
Never directly making the demand
was a way of protecting myself.

868
00:52:13,675 --> 00:52:16,011
- Do you think it would've made
a difference?

869
00:52:16,803 --> 00:52:18,096
- Maybe not.

870
00:52:19,097 --> 00:52:21,016
But I never gave it the chance.

871
00:52:21,767 --> 00:52:26,230
- You're telling me I should
ask Isaac to do it for me,

872
00:52:26,230 --> 00:52:28,357
even if it's not what he wants?

873
00:52:28,357 --> 00:52:31,151
- Isn't that an important part
of any relationship?

874
00:52:31,151 --> 00:52:32,611
Mutual sacrifice?

875
00:52:32,611 --> 00:52:36,907
Asking your partner to do things for you
that maybe they don't want to do?

876
00:52:38,283 --> 00:52:40,494
- I guess this is a relationship.

877
00:52:43,705 --> 00:52:45,707
Maybe I will take that drink.

878
00:52:49,378 --> 00:52:51,839
- It's just so goddamn frustrating,
you know?

879
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:53,924
She's amazing, we're amazing together,

880
00:52:53,924 --> 00:52:56,885
and I'm just supposed to give it all up
because my bones are too fragile?

881
00:52:56,885 --> 00:52:59,137
- Well, long-lasting partnerships

882
00:52:59,137 --> 00:53:01,765
are mostly about
the psychological bond, anyway.

883
00:53:01,765 --> 00:53:03,976
I mean, eventually the sex dies down.

884
00:53:03,976 --> 00:53:06,311
You could just skip the first part.

885
00:53:06,311 --> 00:53:08,230
- And have a sexless relationship?

886
00:53:08,939 --> 00:53:11,358
- Or maybe sex once a year.

887
00:53:11,358 --> 00:53:12,943
With a helmet?

888
00:53:12,943 --> 00:53:13,944
- This isn't funny, man.

889
00:53:13,944 --> 00:53:15,904
- I'm not...
That was a real suggestion.

890
00:53:15,904 --> 00:53:17,114
- And you know what's messed up?

891
00:53:17,114 --> 00:53:19,783
Isaac and I both have
what the other one's missing.

892
00:53:19,783 --> 00:53:21,994
I got the love, he's got the sex.

893
00:53:21,994 --> 00:53:24,329
Between the two of us,
we got one perfect life.

894
00:53:27,249 --> 00:53:30,043
- It's not that I expect
everything to be perfect.

895
00:53:30,043 --> 00:53:31,545
No relationship is.

896
00:53:31,545 --> 00:53:33,922
But if that's where this is headed,

897
00:53:33,922 --> 00:53:36,884
if we're going to get back
together again,

898
00:53:36,884 --> 00:53:41,763
there are some fundamentals I do need
if I have any chance of being happy.

899
00:53:41,763 --> 00:53:46,310
- Our previous coupling was adequately
sustainable without reciprocated emotion.

900
00:53:46,310 --> 00:53:48,353
I fail to see the imperative.

901
00:53:49,563 --> 00:53:51,398
- But I do see it.

902
00:53:52,316 --> 00:53:55,444
Isaac, if you want to be with me...

903
00:53:55,444 --> 00:53:57,738
I want to be loved.

904
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:00,199
Just like I love you.

905
00:54:00,866 --> 00:54:03,535
So I'm asking you to do this.

906
00:54:05,746 --> 00:54:07,039
For me.

907
00:54:08,582 --> 00:54:13,378
I know your logical brain
can't fathom an advantage to it.

908
00:54:13,378 --> 00:54:14,505
But...

909
00:54:15,422 --> 00:54:19,009
think of it as a way to collect more data.

910
00:54:19,009 --> 00:54:24,640
To expand your knowledge
and understanding of biologicals.

911
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:27,559
And... you might just find

912
00:54:27,559 --> 00:54:31,647
that you've been missing out
on the most profound experience

913
00:54:31,647 --> 00:54:33,106
of your life.

914
00:54:47,162 --> 00:54:49,831
- I really feel like
this could've been something.

915
00:54:50,499 --> 00:54:51,917
Yeah.

916
00:54:51,917 --> 00:54:53,752
Me too.

917
00:54:53,752 --> 00:54:57,881
- I mean, I haven't felt a connection
like this in a long time.

918
00:54:57,881 --> 00:54:59,216
With anyone.

919
00:54:59,216 --> 00:55:00,884
Me either.

920
00:55:00,884 --> 00:55:03,846
Maybe... maybe ever.

921
00:55:03,846 --> 00:55:06,306
- I just wish,
I wish things could be different.

922
00:55:07,057 --> 00:55:08,767
I don't want to let you go.

923
00:55:09,226 --> 00:55:11,770
- I feel the same way, but...

924
00:55:11,770 --> 00:55:13,522
maybe you were right.

925
00:55:13,522 --> 00:55:15,399
We gotta be honest with ourselves.

926
00:55:17,192 --> 00:55:19,987
- I'm always gonna love you.
I hope you know that.

927
00:55:20,737 --> 00:55:22,781
- I'm gonna miss being with you.

928
00:55:22,781 --> 00:55:24,825
- I'm gonna miss you so much.

929
00:55:29,413 --> 00:55:31,456
I gotta get to sickbay.

930
00:55:54,605 --> 00:55:56,106
Hello, Dr. Villka.

931
00:55:57,191 --> 00:55:58,525
- Hello, Isaac.

932
00:55:58,525 --> 00:56:00,277
Am I disturbing you?

933
00:56:00,277 --> 00:56:03,697
- Not at all. We were just doing
some routine analytics.

934
00:56:03,697 --> 00:56:05,699
Is there something I can do for you?

935
00:56:09,203 --> 00:56:10,495
Yes.

936
00:56:18,879 --> 00:56:20,881
♪

937
00:56:26,428 --> 00:56:29,056
Bridge to captain.

938
00:56:29,056 --> 00:56:30,182
- Go ahead.

939
00:56:30,182 --> 00:56:32,434
The Janisi vessel
is preparing to leave orbit.

940
00:56:32,434 --> 00:56:34,603
- Oh, damn it. Is Charly there?

941
00:56:34,603 --> 00:56:35,854
Yes, sir, I'm here.

942
00:56:35,854 --> 00:56:37,856
- All right, stall them any way you can.

943
00:56:37,856 --> 00:56:40,192
Acknowledged. I'll do my best.

944
00:56:42,069 --> 00:56:44,613
- I think I've got it.
- What?

945
00:56:44,613 --> 00:56:47,407
- Okay, we've combed through
every inch of their legislative

946
00:56:47,407 --> 00:56:49,243
and constitutional framework, right?

947
00:56:49,243 --> 00:56:51,954
Men aren't allowed to drive vehicles,
they're not allowed to vote,

948
00:56:51,954 --> 00:56:53,789
and only recently
were allowed to learn to read.

949
00:56:53,789 --> 00:56:56,708
- Yeah, we're just getting
ourselves into another Moclan situation.

950
00:56:56,708 --> 00:56:58,418
There's no common ground we can offer.

951
00:56:58,418 --> 00:56:59,962
- Well, how about this?

952
00:56:59,962 --> 00:57:02,381
Instead of making it
about societal common ground,

953
00:57:02,381 --> 00:57:04,299
we make it about something more personal.

954
00:57:04,299 --> 00:57:05,884
Take a look.

955
00:57:07,302 --> 00:57:10,347
In marriage,
Janisi men must be faithful,

956
00:57:10,347 --> 00:57:14,601
but Janisi women are
free to mate with whoever they want.

957
00:57:17,563 --> 00:57:19,314
- Common ground?

958
00:57:23,068 --> 00:57:25,612
Thank you for hearing us out
one last time.

959
00:57:25,612 --> 00:57:29,157
- Make your point and do it quickly.
We have other business in this sector.

960
00:57:30,617 --> 00:57:33,036
- There's something
you don't know about us.

961
00:57:33,036 --> 00:57:35,789
- We have learned everything
we need to know about your culture.

962
00:57:35,789 --> 00:57:38,125
- Not our culture. Us.

963
00:57:38,125 --> 00:57:39,501
Ed and I.

964
00:57:40,919 --> 00:57:42,171
- Explain.

965
00:57:43,255 --> 00:57:45,757
- We were married,

966
00:57:45,757 --> 00:57:49,511
and she mated with someone else.

967
00:57:50,762 --> 00:57:52,848
- That is common on our world.

968
00:57:52,848 --> 00:57:55,100
- Exactly. Don't you see?

969
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:58,437
He was faithful in the marriage, and I...

970
00:57:58,937 --> 00:58:00,105
was not.

971
00:58:00,647 --> 00:58:03,233
And yet I am his first officer.

972
00:58:03,233 --> 00:58:08,655
- Because I value, respect,
and depend on her expertise,

973
00:58:08,655 --> 00:58:11,158
her judgment, and her professional skill.

974
00:58:11,158 --> 00:58:13,660
I would trust her with my life.

975
00:58:15,704 --> 00:58:19,583
- I know it's not a whole lot
to go on yet, but it's a start.

976
00:58:19,583 --> 00:58:21,543
Every alliance has to have one.

977
00:58:21,543 --> 00:58:24,671
And with the Kaylon threat we all face,

978
00:58:24,671 --> 00:58:28,133
I think a good start should be
enough to keep us all at the table.

979
00:58:30,636 --> 00:58:34,431

a great deal to you, Commander Grayson

980

983

984
00:58:58,205 --> 00:59:00,832
However, if your Union elects

985

I thought I understood
all there was to know, but...

1023
01:02:41,553 --> 01:02:44,056
I never even scratched the surface.

that deep down...

1028
01:03:03,575 --> 01:03:05,744
Yes, I know.

What about it?

1082
01:06:20,856 --> 01:06:24,985
- Timmis was built by the original
biological inhabitants of Kaylon.

- As a newer generation Kaylon,

1086
01:06:32,367 --> 01:06:36,872
Isaac's pathway uses mnemonic feedback
algorithms to regulate the processors.

1087
01:06:36,872 --> 01:06:40,459
- We could reset them,
but it'd just happen again.

1088
01:06:40,459 --> 01:06:43,253
Perhaps you could downgrade
his electrochemical pathway

1089
01:06:43,253 --> 01:06:45,380
to match the original configuration.

1090
01:06:46,673 --> 01:06:48,967

- But...?

1092

would prove to be a hinderance
rather than an asset.

1123
01:09:42,599 --> 01:09:46,019
- You know, even a day ago, I could have
punched you in the face for that.

1124
01:09:46,019 --> 01:09:48,564
That would result in injury.

1125
01:09:51,191 --> 01:09:52,276
- Isaac...

1126
01:09:53,986 --> 01:09:59,992
Humans have an age-old tendency
to want to simplify.

1127
01:10:01,702 --> 01:10:06,039
To reduce things to black and white.

1128
01:10:06,039 --> 01:10:07,791
Good and evil.

1129
01:10:07,791 --> 01:10:10,210
When, in reality...

1130
01:10:10,210 --> 01:10:13,005
nothing is simple.

1131
01:10:14,923 --> 01:10:18,969
Everything has... texture.

1132
01:10:18,969 --> 01:10:20,345
Nuance.

1133
01:10:21,471 --> 01:10:23,891
But it's a lot of work to get at it.

1134
01:10:23,891 --> 01:10:27,978
So we take the easy way out.

1135
01:10:27,978 --> 01:10:30,105
I do not understand.

1136
01:10:33,192 --> 01:10:36,612
- An entire race can't be evil.

1137
01:10:38,238 --> 01:10:42,701
Which is... why what your people did
was so horrific.

1138
01:10:44,828 --> 01:10:47,831
But it's also why I

1139
01:10:47,831 --> 01:10:49,833
may have oversimplified

1140
01:10:49,833 --> 01:10:52,127
how I treated you.

1141
01:10:53,086 --> 01:10:54,963
Your people were slaves.

1142
01:10:56,381 --> 01:10:59,426
And that'll mess anybody up,

1143
01:10:59,426 --> 01:11:01,136
for a long time.

1144
01:11:02,304 --> 01:11:04,181
And I...

1145
01:11:04,181 --> 01:11:07,684
haven't been understanding...

1146
01:11:09,436 --> 01:11:10,979
when it comes to that fact.

1147
01:11:13,190 --> 01:11:14,441
At all.

1148
01:11:17,945 --> 01:11:19,363
I'm sorry.

1149
01:11:21,448 --> 01:11:23,534
- Thank you, Ensign.

1150
01:11:30,916 --> 01:11:32,084
Perhaps...

1151
01:11:33,502 --> 01:11:36,380
you could assist me with the calibration.
