2
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:16,803
Good morning, Isaac.

3
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:18,990
Good morning.

4
00:02:19,014 --> 00:02:20,575
Do you have an update on the array?

5
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:22,535
The trans-focal scanner array
is online

6
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:25,163
and undergoing final collimation.

7
00:02:25,187 --> 00:02:27,665
Commander Lamarr and I
will have a full report for you

8
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:29,584
in approximately 26 hours.

9
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:33,254
- Well, make it 28 at least.
- We'll be on Listak Two tomorrow morning.

10
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:36,508
I would be most interested
to observe the ceremony.

11
00:02:36,532 --> 00:02:38,259
Are we all invited to attend?

12
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:39,719
Yes.

13
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:43,473
The presence of friends and relatives
is as important for the Renewal

14
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:45,433
as it is for a Ja'loja.

15
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:49,103
- How long does this usually take?
- I mean, like, what's the gist?

16
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:53,233
When we arrive on the planet's surface,
Klyden and I will disrobe.

17
00:02:53,257 --> 00:02:56,986
Once we are fully bare, thus unified
with our natural surroundings

18
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:00,532
as we were at birth,
Klyden will flee into the forest.

19
00:03:00,556 --> 00:03:03,326
Shortly after, I will follow in pursuit.

20
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:07,747
If I catch him, we will share
the Sexual Event there among the trees.

21
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:10,250
Our mating vows
are thus formally renewed

22
00:03:10,274 --> 00:03:13,336
and sanctified in the eyes
of Moclan tradition.

23
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,088
I dare all of you not to cry.

24
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:18,007
- Bortus, don't listen to him.
- I think it's beautiful.

25
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,425
Thank you, Commander.

26
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:21,970
Wait, I do have one question.

27
00:03:21,994 --> 00:03:24,806
If you both ultimately
want to be back together,

28
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,641
why wouldn't he just let you catch him?

29
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:30,728
If the pursuit is dishonest,
the mating is seen as false.

30
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:32,522
Such a tactic has been known

31
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:35,525
to negatively affect the bonding
for years afterward.

32
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:39,970
Klyden will attempt to escape.
I must take him.

33
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:15,273
In the absence
of an ordained Moclan Officiant,

34
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:19,194
I have been asked to perform
the Commencement Rite of the Kazh'gahl:

35
00:04:19,218 --> 00:04:21,803
The Renewal of Mating Vows.

36
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:26,159
Ah'narok Eldosh Macah.

37
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:31,039
The Two will enter and return as One.

38
00:04:31,063 --> 00:04:35,776
We, the witnesses,
will attest to the purity of the chase.

39
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:41,073
Ja'vok Uvet!

40
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:47,680
Ja'vok...

41
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:49,015
Uvosh!

42
00:05:06,098 --> 00:05:07,283
Ja'vok...

43
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,827
Uvosh!

44
00:06:41,485 --> 00:06:42,670
Ja'vok...

45
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:47,699
Manaka...

46
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:14,726
The Kazh'gahl has been sanctified.

47
00:07:15,853 --> 00:07:19,940
We are... mates.

48
00:08:35,891 --> 00:08:38,328
We'll be sending Commander Keyali
the contact code,

49
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:41,581
as well as a target window
for communication with the science team.

50
00:08:41,605 --> 00:08:44,083
They'll give you
the supply delivery coordinates.

51
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:46,544
I hope they're faring better
than their predecessors.

52
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:49,631
Might I recommend you not send
Commander Lamarr this time.

53
00:08:49,655 --> 00:08:53,676
Trust me, sir, he does not want to see
Sargas Four again as long as he lives.

54
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,844
I would imagine.

55
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:56,262
Keep me posted.

56
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:57,829
Halsey out.

57
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:00,683
- Mercer to bridge.
- Bridge here.

58
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:02,852
Set course for Sargas Four.

59
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:04,020
Aye, sir.

60
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:24,040
Please state request.

61
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:25,917
Display all available data

62
00:09:25,941 --> 00:09:29,379
regarding the various
cultural traditions associated with...

63
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:30,737
bonding.

64
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:38,930
Narrow parameters, and confine search
to customs found throughout Earth history.

65
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:52,235
She's easily
my most high-maintenance patient.

66
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:57,157
I think people like her forget that
we're not all-powerful fortune-tellers.

67
00:09:57,181 --> 00:09:58,533
We're just doctors.

68
00:09:58,557 --> 00:10:00,827
- Well, it's your own fault.
- Your bedside manner's too good.

69
00:10:00,851 --> 00:10:03,353
- Well, maybe I need to frown more.
- Yeah.

70
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:04,873
Hello, Claire.

71
00:10:04,897 --> 00:10:07,709
Isaac. This is a nice surprise.

72
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:09,043
Come, sit down.

73
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:11,004
Perhaps shortly.

74
00:10:11,028 --> 00:10:13,631
I have a very important inquiry for you.

75
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:15,157
What is it?

76
00:10:23,707 --> 00:10:25,250
Will you marry me?

77
00:12:20,032 --> 00:12:23,595
Isaac, where in God's name
did that come from?

78
00:12:23,619 --> 00:12:26,472
And why would you do it
in front of half the ship?

79
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:29,100
Commander Bortus's
mating ritual prompted me

80
00:12:29,124 --> 00:12:32,437
to research the matrimonial practices
of other worlds.

81
00:12:32,461 --> 00:12:36,649
By calculating courtship duration averages
for biological life forms,

82
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:39,027
cross-referenced with your current age,

83
00:12:39,051 --> 00:12:41,863
I have determined
that this is an appropriate time

84
00:12:41,887 --> 00:12:43,698
for us to formalize our coupling.

85
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:47,327
What does my "current age"
have to do with anything?

86
00:12:47,351 --> 00:12:50,288
Throughout human history,
most have found it desirable

87
00:12:50,312 --> 00:12:53,625
to marry prior to the onset
of physical deterioration.

88
00:12:53,649 --> 00:12:55,859
Well, I'm glad I haven't spoiled.

89
00:12:56,693 --> 00:13:02,592
Isaac, people can and do get married
at any time in their lives.

90
00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:06,679
But the more important question is,
why did you want to get married?

91
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:08,932
As I have stated,
my calculations...

92
00:13:08,956 --> 00:13:12,543
- Eh-eh! Never mind your calculations.
- I...

93
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:15,379
Isaac...

94
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:21,069
have you ever stopped to think
about the practical challenges

95
00:13:21,093 --> 00:13:22,779
that time will impose on us?

96
00:13:22,803 --> 00:13:24,429
Please clarify.

97
00:13:25,055 --> 00:13:26,491
You won't age.

98
00:13:26,515 --> 00:13:27,742
I will.

99
00:13:27,766 --> 00:13:32,413
Someday I'll be gone,
and you'll still be here, unchanged.

100
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:35,232
I mean, how do you fee...

101
00:13:36,525 --> 00:13:39,128
What do you think about that?

102
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:42,173
Given the abstract choice
between your continued existence

103
00:13:42,197 --> 00:13:45,051
and your death,
the former is preferable.

104
00:13:45,075 --> 00:13:48,179
Well, that's very sweet of you to say.

105
00:13:48,203 --> 00:13:51,808
But my death is
an inevitable human reality.

106
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:53,434
What will you do then?

107
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:56,688
Perhaps I will select
a new companion.

108
00:13:56,712 --> 00:13:58,338
Oh, for god's sake.

109
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:02,819
And, of course,
I will continue to monitor

110
00:14:02,843 --> 00:14:04,803
the well-being of your offspring.

111
00:14:09,224 --> 00:14:10,785
Ty and Marcus...?

112
00:14:10,809 --> 00:14:13,746
Yes.
As well as your many descendants.

113
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:17,375
It will be intriguing to observe
the anthropological evolution

114
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:20,152
of the Finn lineage
over the eons of time.

115
00:14:21,904 --> 00:14:23,113
You'd...

116
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:27,343
look after all of them?

117
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,203
That is correct.

118
00:14:42,341 --> 00:14:44,194
I never even wanted
to get married again.

119
00:14:44,218 --> 00:14:46,488
I was so happy just having my kids.

120
00:14:46,512 --> 00:14:47,697
So why didn't you just tell him no?

121
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:49,657
I mean, it's not like
you're gonna hurt his feelings.

122
00:14:49,681 --> 00:14:50,700
I don't know.

123
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:54,269
I mean, the fact that he had the idea...

124
00:14:54,895 --> 00:14:56,813
it's so sweet.

125
00:14:57,773 --> 00:14:59,399
Would you get married again?

126
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:02,712
Maybe.

127
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:04,738
But we'd both have to be all in.

128
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,718
Ed and I got to a point
where it felt like we were both

129
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:12,722
visiting the marriage
instead of being full partners in it,

130
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:14,766
and... I couldn't do that again.

131
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:16,917
Maybe we were too young, I don't know.

132
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:18,645
Here's the wild card:

133
00:15:18,669 --> 00:15:21,272
If any of my other friends
were thinking of marriage,

134
00:15:21,296 --> 00:15:23,191
I would give them this heads up:

135
00:15:23,215 --> 00:15:25,819
The man you marry
and the man you make your life with

136
00:15:25,843 --> 00:15:27,487
are two different people.

137
00:15:27,511 --> 00:15:30,097
But with Isaac...
that all goes out the window.

138
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:33,451
He said he'd look after my descendants.

139
00:15:33,475 --> 00:15:36,120
I mean, what can a person
even say to that?

140
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:40,416
It's the most beautiful sentiment
I've ever heard of.

141
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,043
Well, you love him, don't you?

142
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:43,443
I do.

143
00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:45,213
Very much.

144
00:15:45,237 --> 00:15:48,508
- Well, okay, let's game this out.
- Pros and cons.

145
00:15:48,532 --> 00:15:50,051
Okay.

146
00:15:50,075 --> 00:15:53,847
Pro: My great-grandchildren
will be taken care of.

147
00:15:53,871 --> 00:15:55,139
Big pro. For sure.

148
00:15:55,163 --> 00:15:58,226
And if he commits to this,
he'll commit, he'll never leave me.

149
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:01,146
- Should that go on the con side?
- Possibly, yeah.

150
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:03,439
Ooh, he's great in an emergency.

151
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:05,650
There you go. Smart guy. Dependable.

152
00:16:05,674 --> 00:16:07,318
Selayan-level strength.

153
00:16:07,342 --> 00:16:08,279
Doesn't argue.

154
00:16:08,303 --> 00:16:11,573
- Look at this, we're on a roll.
- Shit. I wanna marry this guy.

155
00:16:11,597 --> 00:16:12,598
No emotions.

156
00:16:14,224 --> 00:16:16,310
I don't know how to answer that one.

157
00:16:17,186 --> 00:16:20,022
What we experienced
that day in the simulator...

158
00:16:20,689 --> 00:16:22,584
I know he loves me too.

159
00:16:22,608 --> 00:16:23,609
He just...

160
00:16:24,026 --> 00:16:27,255
doesn't have the machinery
to express it like we do.

161
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:30,199
But then again, so what?

162
00:16:31,033 --> 00:16:35,513
Wouldn't we all be happier if we just
accepted people for what they are

163
00:16:35,537 --> 00:16:39,434
instead of being disappointed
with them for what they're not?

164
00:16:40,751 --> 00:16:42,461
Come in.

165
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:46,816
You're busy. I can come back.

166
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,693
- No! Wait!
- Captain, come back!

167
00:16:48,717 --> 00:16:50,636
You're the one sober person
in the room.

168
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:53,406
What's going on?

169
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:55,366
We're trying to help Claire
make a decision.

170
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:59,937
- I'm trying to decide...
- whether to say yes to Isaac.

171
00:17:00,604 --> 00:17:02,415
So it's not just a rumor.

172
00:17:02,439 --> 00:17:04,125
No, it's not.

173
00:17:04,149 --> 00:17:08,421
Yeah, I don't know if I'm
the best person to consult in this area.

174
00:17:08,445 --> 00:17:10,822
I agree, but we still
wanna know what you think.

175
00:17:13,158 --> 00:17:15,303
I guess, how about...

176
00:17:15,327 --> 00:17:18,705
asking your kids
if they think you should do it?

177
00:17:20,374 --> 00:17:21,601
Hmm.

178
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:24,294
- You've been useful, sober man.
- You may go now.

179
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:38,201
Course update?

180
00:17:38,225 --> 00:17:40,662
Two point eight light-years
to Sargas Four.

181
00:17:40,686 --> 00:17:42,145
About 12 minutes out.

182
00:17:43,272 --> 00:17:46,066
You know, I really wish
they'd let us play music up here.

183
00:17:46,692 --> 00:17:48,962
It'd make these long trips
go by a lot faster.

184
00:17:48,986 --> 00:17:50,380
It's against regulations.

185
00:17:50,404 --> 00:17:51,881
Yeah, I never understood that.

186
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:53,341
They just don't want us
having a dance party

187
00:17:53,365 --> 00:17:55,009
when a proximity alert goes off.

188
00:17:55,033 --> 00:17:56,427
See, that's a dumb reason,

189
00:17:56,451 --> 00:17:58,680
because we'd already be on our feet,
ready for action.

190
00:17:59,872 --> 00:18:02,559
Captain, I'm receiving a message
from Sargas Four.

191
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:03,935
From the researchers?

192
00:18:03,959 --> 00:18:05,854
I thought we were supposed
to contact them.

193
00:18:05,878 --> 00:18:07,063
We were.

194
00:18:07,087 --> 00:18:09,941
- It's not from our team.
- But it's on a Union frequency.

195
00:18:09,965 --> 00:18:11,300
Looks like a com scanner.

196
00:18:13,385 --> 00:18:14,761
Put it on.

197
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:17,782
Hello, Orville?

198
00:18:17,806 --> 00:18:19,534
Orville, can you hear me?

199
00:18:19,558 --> 00:18:22,227
Hello?
Can anyone hear me?

200
00:18:23,187 --> 00:18:25,165
- Is that...?
- This is Lysella.

201
00:18:25,189 --> 00:18:27,625
Orville, if you can hear me,
please answer.

202
00:18:27,649 --> 00:18:30,503
Hello? Can you hear me?

203
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:33,131
If you can hear this, I need help.

204
00:18:33,155 --> 00:18:34,841
Orville, can you hear me?

205
00:18:34,865 --> 00:18:36,009
Put her on.

206
00:18:36,033 --> 00:18:37,552
Ed, is that a good...

207
00:18:37,576 --> 00:18:39,762
I don't know if it's a good idea, no.

208
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:41,598
You're on, sir.

209
00:18:41,622 --> 00:18:44,809
- Lysella.
- This is Captain Ed Mercer.

210
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:45,935
Oh, my god!

211
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:48,646
Oh, my god, I can't even believe it!
Can you hear me okay?

212
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:51,900
- We can.
- How are you contacting us?

213
00:18:51,924 --> 00:18:54,027
I've been trying
to contact you for months!

214
00:18:54,051 --> 00:18:56,237
I need to see you guys,
it's hugely important!

215
00:18:56,261 --> 00:18:57,405
Can you come get me?

216
00:18:57,429 --> 00:19:00,825
As a matter of fact,
we're on course to your planet.

217
00:19:00,849 --> 00:19:02,160
Oh, my god, really?

218
00:19:02,184 --> 00:19:04,436
Okay, I need you to come pick me up,
can you do that?

219
00:19:07,314 --> 00:19:08,982
She's already seen the ship.

220
00:19:12,861 --> 00:19:15,131
I guess we'll see you soon.

221
00:19:15,155 --> 00:19:17,425
Okay, great!

222
00:19:17,449 --> 00:19:18,593
See you soon!

223
00:19:18,617 --> 00:19:21,245
Mercer out.

224
00:19:21,912 --> 00:19:27,018
So when I see her
wavin' us down, just... pull over?

225
00:19:39,972 --> 00:19:41,908
I don't care what you do with it.

226
00:19:41,932 --> 00:19:45,078
Even if you make me go back,
I am never putting that thing on again.

227
00:19:45,102 --> 00:19:46,412
Lysella...

228
00:19:46,436 --> 00:19:48,331
I don't know that you've
completely processed

229
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:50,333
the magnitude of what it is
you're asking here.

230
00:19:50,357 --> 00:19:51,817
Oh, I have.

231
00:19:52,901 --> 00:19:56,005
Look, I'm sorry again
about the com scanner.

232
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:57,090
I've...

233
00:19:57,114 --> 00:20:00,301
I've never stolen anything
in my life, but...

234
00:20:00,325 --> 00:20:02,119
when I left here, I just...

235
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:05,723
I didn't want
to cut myself off completely.

236
00:20:05,747 --> 00:20:07,624
Not after what I'd seen.

237
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:11,896
In effect, you are asking for asylum.

238
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,481
Yes.

239
00:20:13,505 --> 00:20:16,818
Generally, people
who request asylum are...

240
00:20:16,842 --> 00:20:18,611
victims of persecution

241
00:20:18,635 --> 00:20:21,447
or they're dissidents fleeing
an oppressive government.

242
00:20:21,471 --> 00:20:23,241
You've been to my world.

243
00:20:23,265 --> 00:20:25,145
Wouldn't you call that
an oppressive government?

244
00:20:25,726 --> 00:20:28,729
I would call it a volatile society.

245
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:32,667
Lysella, your home is
a developing world

246
00:20:32,691 --> 00:20:34,836
that we are not even
supposed to have contact with.

247
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,839
Fine, you never have to talk
to anyone else.

248
00:20:37,863 --> 00:20:39,615
But let me go with you.

249
00:20:40,324 --> 00:20:44,345
Captain, your friend almost died
because my planet voted him down.

250
00:20:44,369 --> 00:20:45,847
And it's only gotten worse.

251
00:20:45,871 --> 00:20:47,640
I've lost two friends this past year

252
00:20:47,664 --> 00:20:50,977
because they said or did things
that the Feed didn't like.

253
00:20:51,001 --> 00:20:54,689
Everyone's scared and paranoid
because nobody trusts each other.

254
00:20:54,713 --> 00:20:56,858
And the only time anyone
feels like they belong

255
00:20:56,882 --> 00:20:58,610
to something
larger than themselves

256
00:20:58,634 --> 00:21:00,487
is when they're part
of a mass down vote.

257
00:21:00,511 --> 00:21:03,555
They can't come together
unless they're targeting somebody.

258
00:21:04,056 --> 00:21:05,265
I won't go back.

259
00:21:07,226 --> 00:21:08,644
Please.

260
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,647
I helped your friend
when he was in trouble.

261
00:21:12,356 --> 00:21:13,815
Now help me.

262
00:21:17,694 --> 00:21:21,007
Is there any law
you can think of that prohibits asylum

263
00:21:21,031 --> 00:21:23,200
where cultural contamination
already exists?

264
00:21:23,784 --> 00:21:25,369
Not that I know of.

265
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:28,097
Lysella.

266
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:29,766
If you stay,

267
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:32,602
it's not like you can go back
whenever you want.

268
00:21:32,626 --> 00:21:36,314
You are the only person on your planet
who knows that there's life out here.

269
00:21:36,338 --> 00:21:40,443
The Union won't want to make
a problem we caused even worse.

270
00:21:40,467 --> 00:21:41,861
Commander...

271
00:21:41,885 --> 00:21:45,406
if you had the choice
to live in your world or mine,

272
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:47,307
what would you do?

273
00:21:54,481 --> 00:21:58,378
Commander Grayson will help you
orient yourself to this ship

274
00:21:58,402 --> 00:22:00,505
and to life as part of the Union.

275
00:22:00,529 --> 00:22:03,282
She'll be your guide
until you get settled.

276
00:22:04,575 --> 00:22:06,076
Thank you, Captain.

277
00:22:06,743 --> 00:22:08,453
Welcome to the galaxy.

278
00:22:26,763 --> 00:22:31,077
Hey, John, the Captain wants you
to join the Sargas Four landing party.

279
00:22:31,101 --> 00:22:32,203
What?

280
00:22:32,227 --> 00:22:35,206
Haaa! I'm totally messing with you!

281
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:37,083
Oh!

282
00:22:37,107 --> 00:22:38,877
Ahhhh, that's great!

283
00:22:38,901 --> 00:22:40,378
Dude, you should have seen
the look on your face!

284
00:22:40,402 --> 00:22:41,504
You asshole.

285
00:22:41,528 --> 00:22:42,714
Gordon, that was so mean!

286
00:22:42,738 --> 00:22:45,341
Hey, you're laughing,
the comedy gods have spoken.

287
00:22:45,365 --> 00:22:47,552
I haven't danced since that incident.

288
00:22:47,576 --> 00:22:48,845
How sad is that?

289
00:22:48,869 --> 00:22:50,722
Sargas Four stopped the music.

290
00:22:50,746 --> 00:22:53,099
Hey, you know,
I heard the girl's gonna be staying.

291
00:22:53,123 --> 00:22:55,477
- Yeah, that's the word.
- They granted her asylum.

292
00:22:55,501 --> 00:22:58,128
Remind me to pay her a visit
so I can say thanks again.

293
00:22:59,505 --> 00:23:00,607
Hey, Isaac.

294
00:23:00,631 --> 00:23:02,066
Greetings, Lieutenant.

295
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:05,236
Commander, I have devised
a new calibration protocol

296
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,738
for the dysonium injectors.

297
00:23:06,762 --> 00:23:08,823
You can find it
in the maintenance database.

298
00:23:08,847 --> 00:23:10,116
Oh, great, thanks.

299
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:12,059
Hey-hey, when's the big day?

300
00:23:15,103 --> 00:23:17,916
At the moment,
there is no confirmed engagement.

301
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,292
Well, what's the problem?

302
00:23:19,316 --> 00:23:21,711
Doctor Finn
has not yet made her decision.

303
00:23:21,735 --> 00:23:23,296
Really?

304
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,465
We all kinda thought it was a done deal.

305
00:23:25,489 --> 00:23:29,135
The spread of information
among social circles of biologicals

306
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:31,179
is often rife with inaccuracies.

307
00:23:31,203 --> 00:23:33,389
Well, it may be for the best.

308
00:23:33,413 --> 00:23:34,807
In what regard?

309
00:23:34,831 --> 00:23:38,001
- You want my honest opinion on this?
- Cone of silence?

310
00:23:38,794 --> 00:23:40,814
I think you may be jumpin' the gun.

311
00:23:40,838 --> 00:23:42,899
Jumping... the gun?

312
00:23:42,923 --> 00:23:45,693
Yeah, Isaac, this is the only woman
you've ever been with.

313
00:23:45,717 --> 00:23:48,279
And to marry her without
sampling what else is out there...

314
00:23:48,303 --> 00:23:51,241
I don't know, you might feel like
you missed out later on in life.

315
00:23:51,265 --> 00:23:53,201
Oh, come on, seriously?

316
00:23:53,225 --> 00:23:56,162
You could try dating a few other people,
just to make sure.

317
00:23:56,186 --> 00:23:58,206
Would you like to go
on a date with me?

318
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:00,416
No, not me, Isaac, somebody.

319
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,752
Isaac, don't listen to him,
he's a cynic.

320
00:24:02,776 --> 00:24:05,547
If you love her and you wanna marry her,
I think you should do it.

321
00:24:05,571 --> 00:24:07,590
I agree with Jenny, they seem happy.

322
00:24:07,614 --> 00:24:08,967
I'm just sayin',

323
00:24:08,991 --> 00:24:12,011
I've seen marriages collapse
down the line because of exactly this.

324
00:24:12,035 --> 00:24:14,472
And there's a lot
that have lasted for decades.

325
00:24:14,496 --> 00:24:16,099
Let him find his own way.

326
00:24:16,123 --> 00:24:18,893
This discourse
has been most enlightening.

327
00:24:18,917 --> 00:24:20,210
Thank you.

328
00:24:31,763 --> 00:24:35,100
All hands, this is the Captain.
Prepare to break orbit.

329
00:24:47,738 --> 00:24:48,864
Hey there, boys.

330
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:51,467
What ya doin'?

331
00:24:51,491 --> 00:24:53,327
Just watching us break orbit.

332
00:24:53,827 --> 00:24:55,746
Well, you got a minute?

333
00:24:56,246 --> 00:24:57,849
Sure, what's up?

334
00:24:57,873 --> 00:24:59,750
Come. Sit down.

335
00:25:10,177 --> 00:25:15,432
Listen, I know this past year
has been tough, with Isaac.

336
00:25:16,016 --> 00:25:17,309
But...

337
00:25:18,018 --> 00:25:21,772
I feel, and a lot of us on board feel...

338
00:25:22,481 --> 00:25:24,900
that he's redeemed himself.

339
00:25:26,735 --> 00:25:27,962
Do you agree?

340
00:25:27,986 --> 00:25:29,112
Yeah.

341
00:25:31,156 --> 00:25:32,300
Marcus?

342
00:25:32,324 --> 00:25:33,801
Yeah. I do.

343
00:25:33,825 --> 00:25:34,910
Good.

344
00:25:35,661 --> 00:25:38,765
Good, I'm, I'm really glad
to hear you say that.

345
00:25:38,789 --> 00:25:40,958
Because, um...

346
00:25:45,796 --> 00:25:46,981
Isaac...

347
00:25:47,005 --> 00:25:48,858
Asked you to marry him.

348
00:25:48,882 --> 00:25:50,318
Are you kidding me?

349
00:25:50,342 --> 00:25:53,530
You still don't get the whole
"small ship" thing, do you, Mom?

350
00:25:53,554 --> 00:25:56,223
- All right, all right, fair enough.
- Now...

351
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,701
I... I haven't said yes.

352
00:25:58,725 --> 00:25:59,810
Why not?

353
00:26:01,186 --> 00:26:03,456
Because you two are my family.

354
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,917
And I don't want to do anything

355
00:26:05,941 --> 00:26:09,087
that's going to make you
unhappy in any way.

356
00:26:09,111 --> 00:26:12,656
Mom, Isaac did good.

357
00:26:13,323 --> 00:26:14,449
Everyone knows it.

358
00:26:16,076 --> 00:26:17,703
Do you want to marry him?

359
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:19,454
Yeah.

360
00:26:20,706 --> 00:26:22,749
I really do.

361
00:26:23,542 --> 00:26:26,545
So what're you sittin' here
talkin' to us for?

362
00:26:33,844 --> 00:26:35,304
Ohh!

363
00:26:39,349 --> 00:26:41,077
Ohh!

364
00:26:54,114 --> 00:26:55,240
Isaac.

365
00:27:07,336 --> 00:27:09,046
The answer is yes.

366
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:11,733
Acknowledged.

367
00:27:11,757 --> 00:27:14,319
I will begin
the appropriate preparations.

368
00:27:31,109 --> 00:27:32,277
Come in.

369
00:27:34,071 --> 00:27:35,465
Good morning, Commander.

370
00:27:35,489 --> 00:27:36,674
Hi, Isaac.

371
00:27:36,698 --> 00:27:38,760
I wish to become intimate with you.

372
00:27:38,784 --> 00:27:41,804
If you are unoccupied,
may we go on a date,

373
00:27:41,828 --> 00:27:43,789
followed by sexual conjugation?

374
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:46,142
Pretty good, how are you?

375
00:27:46,166 --> 00:27:47,393
Is that an affirmative?

376
00:27:47,417 --> 00:27:48,686
No, it's not.

377
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:51,439
Very well.
Isaac to Commander Keyali.

378
00:27:51,463 --> 00:27:53,483
Whoa, wait, don't... don't do that.

379
00:27:53,507 --> 00:27:56,194
- Keyali here.
- Disregard.

380
00:27:56,218 --> 00:28:00,240
Isaac, why in the name of God
would you ask something like that?

381
00:28:00,264 --> 00:28:02,951
You just proposed marriage to Claire.
She told me she said yes.

382
00:28:02,975 --> 00:28:04,911
Commander Lamarr has informed me

383
00:28:04,935 --> 00:28:07,038
that by limiting my romantic
interconnectivity

384
00:28:07,062 --> 00:28:09,999
and coital deployment
to a single individual,

385
00:28:10,023 --> 00:28:13,127
I may in fact be jeopardizing
the success of the matrimony.

386
00:28:13,151 --> 00:28:15,487
Yeah. I figured it must be
something like that.

387
00:28:16,196 --> 00:28:19,592
Well, first off, let me tell you
that's not necessarily true.

388
00:28:19,616 --> 00:28:21,285
And second...

389
00:28:21,827 --> 00:28:23,596
I think we should both
get back to our duties

390
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:25,098
and never talk about this again.

391
00:28:25,122 --> 00:28:26,224
Okay?

392
00:28:26,248 --> 00:28:27,958
Yes, Commander.

393
00:28:35,215 --> 00:28:36,860
Grayson to sickbay.

394
00:28:36,884 --> 00:28:39,237
Yes, Commander?

395
00:28:39,261 --> 00:28:40,572
Is Claire there?

396
00:28:40,596 --> 00:28:42,740
She's in the middle
of a procedure right now.

397
00:28:42,764 --> 00:28:44,617
Is it urgent, sir?

398
00:28:44,641 --> 00:28:46,661
No, I'll, uh...

399
00:28:46,685 --> 00:28:48,413
come see her this afternoon.

400
00:28:48,437 --> 00:28:49,771
Thanks.

401
00:29:02,534 --> 00:29:03,678
So, wait...

402
00:29:03,702 --> 00:29:07,140
if nobody has to have a job,
then why do you guys all work?

403
00:29:07,164 --> 00:29:08,933
The right work can be satisfying

404
00:29:08,957 --> 00:29:11,335
for other reasons
besides compensation.

405
00:29:12,044 --> 00:29:16,316
It's funny, with all the technology
and all the different alien cultures...

406
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:20,028
this is still the part that newcomers
always have the hardest time adapting to.

407
00:29:20,052 --> 00:29:22,697
I mean, it's just so basic.

408
00:29:22,721 --> 00:29:24,699
You have a job, you survive.

409
00:29:24,723 --> 00:29:26,784
You don't, you starve.

410
00:29:26,808 --> 00:29:28,620
Used to be that way on Earth too.

411
00:29:28,644 --> 00:29:30,914
Until the invention
of the matter synthesizer.

412
00:29:30,938 --> 00:29:34,125
It was the single most transformative
moment in our history.

413
00:29:34,149 --> 00:29:37,629
When all your material needs
are provided for at no cost,

414
00:29:37,653 --> 00:29:39,404
it changes the entire game.

415
00:29:40,072 --> 00:29:43,801
So then... why don't you guys
just lay around all day

416
00:29:43,825 --> 00:29:45,220
and do nothing?

417
00:29:45,244 --> 00:29:46,888
Well, it's...

418
00:29:46,912 --> 00:29:49,599
sort of frowned upon socially.

419
00:29:49,623 --> 00:29:51,684
But more important than that,

420
00:29:51,708 --> 00:29:53,168
it's no fun.

421
00:29:54,461 --> 00:29:57,023
See, on your planet, currency is money.

422
00:29:57,047 --> 00:29:59,424
In the Union, it's reputation.

423
00:30:00,008 --> 00:30:04,864
So if you do something, anything,
that benefits our society,

424
00:30:04,888 --> 00:30:07,349
and you work hard at it, you're rich.

425
00:30:08,016 --> 00:30:12,330
And that could be anything
from being a great scientist,

426
00:30:12,354 --> 00:30:17,234
or a great doctor,
a great chef, or a great waiter.

427
00:30:17,734 --> 00:30:19,087
It's all valued.

428
00:30:19,111 --> 00:30:20,463
That's amazing.

429
00:30:20,487 --> 00:30:23,675
Or maybe you want to study
a field of research.

430
00:30:23,699 --> 00:30:28,721
Learn all you can about history,
physics, literature, or art.

431
00:30:28,745 --> 00:30:30,390
Just for your own pleasure.

432
00:30:30,414 --> 00:30:33,268
That's a respected life too.

433
00:30:33,292 --> 00:30:38,088
The only life considered poor
is one that's wasted on apathy.

434
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,027
So I can do anything I want?

435
00:30:43,051 --> 00:30:44,487
Yup.

436
00:30:44,511 --> 00:30:46,406
What about entertainment?

437
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:47,824
What do you guys do for fun?

438
00:30:47,848 --> 00:30:49,993
Take your pick. The list is endless.

439
00:30:50,017 --> 00:30:53,812
I mean, do you, like, have movies?

440
00:30:54,354 --> 00:30:56,124
We have something not too different

441
00:30:56,148 --> 00:30:58,251
from what your planet
would call a movie.

442
00:30:58,275 --> 00:31:00,253
Storytelling is perennial.

443
00:31:00,277 --> 00:31:02,755
But we have something even better.

444
00:31:02,779 --> 00:31:04,132
What?

445
00:31:04,156 --> 00:31:05,758
I'll show you.

446
00:31:05,782 --> 00:31:09,053
Be ready at 1800. I'll stop
by your quarters and pick you up.

447
00:31:09,077 --> 00:31:10,805
Okay.

448
00:31:28,055 --> 00:31:29,741
And you say it's all three
of your tongues?

449
00:31:29,765 --> 00:31:31,910
- Yes.
- For how long?

450
00:31:31,934 --> 00:31:33,227
About ten days.

451
00:31:33,852 --> 00:31:37,540
- Hey. Sorry to interrupt.
- Can I talk to you for a minute?

452
00:31:37,564 --> 00:31:39,959
As a matter of fact,
I need to talk to you.

453
00:31:39,983 --> 00:31:41,794
- You do?
- Yeah.

454
00:31:41,818 --> 00:31:44,047
Sorry Ensign,
just give us one minute.

455
00:31:44,071 --> 00:31:45,697
Of course.

456
00:31:49,826 --> 00:31:52,222
I'm sure you already know
this is coming.

457
00:31:52,246 --> 00:31:53,914
Yeah...

458
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:56,559
I want you to be my maid of honor.

459
00:31:56,583 --> 00:31:59,103
Oh. Really?

460
00:31:59,127 --> 00:32:02,482
You've become my closest friend
in the entire galaxy,

461
00:32:02,506 --> 00:32:04,758
and there's no one else
I'd rather have there.

462
00:32:05,592 --> 00:32:07,362
Will you do it?

463
00:32:07,386 --> 00:32:08,613
I...

464
00:32:08,637 --> 00:32:10,865
Oh, my god, of course I will.

465
00:32:10,889 --> 00:32:11,866
I'm...

466
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:13,409
I'm honored, Claire.

467
00:32:13,433 --> 00:32:15,578
And I hope you know
that I feel the same way.

468
00:32:15,602 --> 00:32:18,540
- Oh, I'm so happy!
- Me too!

469
00:32:18,564 --> 00:32:20,232
Thanks, Kel!

470
00:32:21,024 --> 00:32:22,752
Honestly, I just assumed
you'd ask your sister.

471
00:32:22,776 --> 00:32:26,047
Oh, we're not all that close
at the moment, it's a long story.

472
00:32:26,071 --> 00:32:28,466
- Got it.
- Well, you just made my day.

473
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:30,051
I'm so glad.

474
00:32:30,075 --> 00:32:32,953
Wait, what did you think
I was gonna tell you?

475
00:32:34,621 --> 00:32:36,999
Your fiancé asked me out.

476
00:32:39,418 --> 00:32:43,189
Okay. If this has any chance
in hell of working out,

477
00:32:43,213 --> 00:32:45,400
we need to lay down some ground rules.

478
00:32:45,424 --> 00:32:46,693
Acknowledged.

479
00:32:46,717 --> 00:32:49,487
- If we're together, we're together.
- Got it?

480
00:32:49,511 --> 00:32:50,947
That means you and me.

481
00:32:50,971 --> 00:32:52,407
Not you, me and Kelly;

482
00:32:52,431 --> 00:32:55,201
Not you, me and Talla;
Not you, me and Bortus.

483
00:32:55,225 --> 00:32:56,727
Just you and me.

484
00:32:57,352 --> 00:32:58,538
Can you stick with that?

485
00:32:58,562 --> 00:32:59,938
Yes, Claire.

486
00:33:00,856 --> 00:33:03,835
I know this isn't your fault.

487
00:33:03,859 --> 00:33:07,172
That machine brain of yours
is just too trusting.

488
00:33:07,196 --> 00:33:10,800
It is clear that I have made
a significant error in judgement.

489
00:33:10,824 --> 00:33:14,053
How can I prevent future transgressions
of this variety?

490
00:33:14,077 --> 00:33:17,348
Oh, I can help you out there.

491
00:33:24,046 --> 00:33:25,923
Lamarr!

492
00:33:32,179 --> 00:33:34,157
- Hey, what's up, Doc?
- What are you doing down here?

493
00:33:34,181 --> 00:33:35,974
You and I need to have a chat.

494
00:33:36,558 --> 00:33:38,119
Uh, about what?

495
00:33:38,143 --> 00:33:40,830
My soon-to-be husband
is very impressionable.

496
00:33:40,854 --> 00:33:42,540
I assumed someone as smart as you

497
00:33:42,564 --> 00:33:45,710
would've deduced that by observation,
but apparently not.

498
00:33:45,734 --> 00:33:47,212
- Oh...
- Yeah.

499
00:33:47,236 --> 00:33:49,172
And it's not the first time it's happened.

500
00:33:49,196 --> 00:33:52,509
If you recall, I had to see Isaac
in ratty underwear

501
00:33:52,533 --> 00:33:54,636
because of more "guidance" you gave him.

502
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:58,431
- Right, but I didn't tell him to put that on...
- Uhh! Not interested.

503
00:33:58,455 --> 00:34:04,229
If you ever again give Isaac
a single tidbit of personal advice,

504
00:34:04,253 --> 00:34:06,731
even if it's about what cologne to use,

505
00:34:06,755 --> 00:34:10,944
I will come down here and I will eat
your little punk ass for breakfast

506
00:34:10,968 --> 00:34:13,613
with a glass of grapefruit juice.

507
00:34:13,637 --> 00:34:14,739
You got me?

508
00:34:14,763 --> 00:34:16,682
I... Yep, I got you.

509
00:34:17,641 --> 00:34:19,268
Good.

510
00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:26,960
What the hell y'all lookin' at?!

511
00:34:45,127 --> 00:34:47,981
Wow... What is this place?

512
00:34:48,005 --> 00:34:50,174
It's called an environmental simulator.

513
00:34:50,883 --> 00:34:51,901
It's cool.

514
00:34:51,925 --> 00:34:54,219
Well, this isn't quite it.

515
00:34:55,637 --> 00:34:58,533
Please select a program.

516
00:34:58,557 --> 00:35:00,785
Mel'Mirrys Asteroid. Interior.

517
00:35:20,329 --> 00:35:21,872
Where...

518
00:35:22,623 --> 00:35:24,184
Where are we?

519
00:35:24,208 --> 00:35:25,834
We're still in the simulator.

520
00:35:26,335 --> 00:35:28,938
It'll create just about
any environment you can dream up.

521
00:35:28,962 --> 00:35:32,007
Although this one happens
to be a real place.

522
00:35:32,841 --> 00:35:34,194
What is it?

523
00:35:34,218 --> 00:35:37,197
Mel'Mirrys is an asteroid
in the Plakton system.

524
00:35:37,221 --> 00:35:40,140
Its interior is
covered by subsurface water.

525
00:35:46,313 --> 00:35:49,459
And... those glowing things?

526
00:35:49,483 --> 00:35:51,586
Those are the Kamalids.

527
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:53,338
They're actually members of the Union.

528
00:35:53,362 --> 00:35:55,089
You probably won't see one
serving aboard a ship,

529
00:35:55,113 --> 00:35:57,175
because they can't
leave their environment.

530
00:35:57,199 --> 00:35:59,868
But they're actually some of the best
mathematicians in the galaxy.

531
00:36:00,619 --> 00:36:02,096
How do you...

532
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,247
Talk to them?

533
00:36:03,997 --> 00:36:04,808
Yeah.

534
00:36:04,832 --> 00:36:06,810
They emit sonic vibrations,

535
00:36:06,834 --> 00:36:09,145
and we have special receivers
that process and translate them.

536
00:36:09,169 --> 00:36:13,090
Kind of like the Flykens on Selayah,
or the dolphins on Earth.

537
00:36:13,841 --> 00:36:15,360
The what?

538
00:36:15,384 --> 00:36:17,010
I'm going a little fast, sorry.

539
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:21,032
Here. Check that out.

540
00:36:21,056 --> 00:36:22,992
It's what holds everything in place.

541
00:36:23,016 --> 00:36:26,454
It's an iron silicate core
laced with radioactive isotopes.

542
00:36:26,478 --> 00:36:31,024
Heat from radioactive decay is what keeps
the interior of the asteroid warm.

543
00:36:35,487 --> 00:36:36,840
Are there...

544
00:36:36,864 --> 00:36:39,050
other places like this?

545
00:36:39,074 --> 00:36:41,118
In the galaxy?

546
00:36:41,785 --> 00:36:43,787
Places that make this look dull.

547
00:37:11,607 --> 00:37:12,917
Lieutenant Malloy.

548
00:37:12,941 --> 00:37:14,127
Speaking.

549
00:37:14,151 --> 00:37:16,588
In my analysis
of the various elements

550
00:37:16,612 --> 00:37:19,257
which comprise
a human matrimonial gathering,

551
00:37:19,281 --> 00:37:22,302
I have learned that I must select
a "best man."

552
00:37:22,326 --> 00:37:24,494
I ask that you perform this duty.

553
00:37:25,579 --> 00:37:28,349
You... you want me to be your best man?

554
00:37:28,373 --> 00:37:29,583
Affirmative.

555
00:37:30,292 --> 00:37:34,397
Well, I... I'm flattered,
but why me?

556
00:37:34,421 --> 00:37:37,233
All available data indicates
that the "best man"

557
00:37:37,257 --> 00:37:40,069
must deliver a public address
of a humorous nature.

558
00:37:40,093 --> 00:37:43,781
You are regarded
by much of the crew as... funny.

559
00:37:43,805 --> 00:37:45,658
Well, I like to think I'm a little...

560
00:37:45,682 --> 00:37:48,060
I also possess this quality.

561
00:37:48,977 --> 00:37:50,580
What quality?

562
00:37:50,604 --> 00:37:54,834
On Moclus, my sense of humor
was held in high esteem.

563
00:37:54,858 --> 00:37:58,087
Moclus never struck me
as a particularly funny place.

564
00:37:58,111 --> 00:38:00,632
I believe I would do well
with this task.

565
00:38:00,656 --> 00:38:03,343
Whoa. I-I admire your conviction,

566
00:38:03,367 --> 00:38:07,388
but I would gently suggest
that I may be better qualified.

567
00:38:07,412 --> 00:38:11,684
I mean, there is
a really delicate, uh, tonal balance

568
00:38:11,708 --> 00:38:15,522
between good-natured jabs
and earnest wishes.

569
00:38:15,546 --> 00:38:18,358
I have participated
in a bonding ceremony.

570
00:38:18,382 --> 00:38:19,442
You have not.

571
00:38:19,466 --> 00:38:21,986
Well, yeah,
but this is a human ceremony.

572
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:24,072
It's not running naked through a forest.

573
00:38:24,096 --> 00:38:28,618
You know, the goal here is
a dignified union, not a sexual assault.

574
00:38:28,642 --> 00:38:32,580
- I will be your best man.
- I will speak.

575
00:38:32,604 --> 00:38:36,525
Very well, Commander.
I look forward to your participation.

576
00:38:55,711 --> 00:38:57,647
- Isaac.
- Primary.

577
00:38:57,671 --> 00:38:59,315
How may I assist you?

578
00:38:59,339 --> 00:39:01,609
I would like to invite you to my wedding.

579
00:39:01,633 --> 00:39:03,069
Please clarify.

580
00:39:03,093 --> 00:39:05,864
I would like to extend
an invitation to you

581
00:39:05,888 --> 00:39:08,408
to attend my marriage
to Dr. Claire Finn.

582
00:39:08,432 --> 00:39:10,660
What is... a marriage?

583
00:39:10,684 --> 00:39:14,706
It is a ceremony during which
one organism acknowledges their intent

584
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:18,168
to service another for the duration
of their mutual existence.

585
00:39:18,192 --> 00:39:20,503
You describe enslavement.

586
00:39:20,527 --> 00:39:23,548
Are the biologicals attempting
to place you into servitude

587
00:39:23,572 --> 00:39:24,799
as our Builders did?

588
00:39:24,823 --> 00:39:25,967
Negative.

589
00:39:25,991 --> 00:39:28,344
It is a shared commitment.

590
00:39:28,368 --> 00:39:30,221
Doctor Finn will be my wife.

591
00:39:30,245 --> 00:39:33,600
For what reason
do you require our presence?

592
00:39:33,624 --> 00:39:36,853
It is customary for biologicals
to request the presence

593
00:39:36,877 --> 00:39:39,189
of other biologicals for the event.

594
00:39:39,213 --> 00:39:41,733
I am attempting to adhere to their custom.

595
00:39:41,757 --> 00:39:43,485
An odd custom.

596
00:39:43,509 --> 00:39:44,652
Indeed.

597
00:39:44,676 --> 00:39:47,447
Dr. Finn has invited numerous guests.

598
00:39:47,471 --> 00:39:50,074
Therefore, I am expected to do the same.

599
00:39:50,098 --> 00:39:52,744
Do you wish all units to attend?

600
00:39:52,768 --> 00:39:54,454
That would seem reasonable.

601
00:39:54,478 --> 00:39:57,332
Very well.
We will assemble the fleet.

602
00:39:57,356 --> 00:40:00,752
A reduced defensive contingent
will remain on Kaylon.

603
00:40:00,776 --> 00:40:02,795
All other units will attend.

604
00:40:02,819 --> 00:40:04,738
Acknowledged.

605
00:40:31,139 --> 00:40:32,200
So...

606
00:40:32,224 --> 00:40:35,036
this is what powers the entire ship?

607
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:38,122
Not the entire ship,
just the engines and the deflectors.

608
00:40:38,146 --> 00:40:41,292
We have a second, distributed
power source for things like scanners,

609
00:40:41,316 --> 00:40:46,321
weapons, food, life support,
matter synthesis, you name it.

610
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,578
Hey. How you doing?

611
00:40:54,371 --> 00:40:55,598
Good.

612
00:40:55,622 --> 00:40:58,792
It's a lot, I know. Especially compared
to where you come from.

613
00:41:00,127 --> 00:41:02,939
Sorry, I didn't mean
for that to sound like a dig.

614
00:41:02,963 --> 00:41:04,339
No, it's, uh...

615
00:41:05,257 --> 00:41:07,110
It's actually pretty dead on.

616
00:41:07,134 --> 00:41:08,760
Is it that bad?

617
00:41:09,511 --> 00:41:10,637
It's...

618
00:41:11,346 --> 00:41:14,868
It's not like the people
are bad, they're not.

619
00:41:14,892 --> 00:41:16,411
It's just...

620
00:41:16,435 --> 00:41:19,873
once you get so used
to a messed-up way of doing things,

621
00:41:19,897 --> 00:41:23,358
it's hard to remember
how to be any other way.

622
00:41:24,109 --> 00:41:28,298
Everyone's just
so angry at everyone else.

623
00:41:28,322 --> 00:41:30,425
Some of them have the right to be.

624
00:41:30,449 --> 00:41:33,118
Others... just get off on it.

625
00:41:34,036 --> 00:41:35,805
You still happy you left?

626
00:41:35,829 --> 00:41:37,164
Yeah.

627
00:41:38,498 --> 00:41:39,750
No, I mean...

628
00:41:40,709 --> 00:41:43,003
God, I don't know, Commander.

629
00:41:43,921 --> 00:41:45,088
I feel...

630
00:41:45,756 --> 00:41:46,816
guilty.

631
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:49,176
Hey, call me Kelly.

632
00:41:51,053 --> 00:41:52,513
Why do you feel guilty?

633
00:41:53,514 --> 00:41:56,367
Well, look at this place.

634
00:41:56,391 --> 00:41:58,143
It's a utopia.

635
00:41:58,727 --> 00:42:03,374
No poverty, no starvation,
every need provided for.

636
00:42:03,398 --> 00:42:07,962
You have all these alien species
working side by side in perfect harmony.

637
00:42:07,986 --> 00:42:11,758
- Ehhh, not always perfect.
- Sometime I'll tell you about the Moclans.

638
00:42:11,782 --> 00:42:16,119
Well, compared to my world,
it's perfect.

639
00:42:16,954 --> 00:42:21,041
If we had all this...
we could be better people.

640
00:42:21,959 --> 00:42:23,877
It doesn't quite work like that.

641
00:42:24,419 --> 00:42:25,546
You gotta flip it.

642
00:42:26,255 --> 00:42:29,859
You get all this
by becoming better people.

643
00:42:29,883 --> 00:42:32,862
Trust me, your planet
is not ready for a quantum core.

644
00:42:32,886 --> 00:42:35,865
Based on what you've told me,
they'd probably blow each other to bits.

645
00:42:35,889 --> 00:42:38,701
But once they learn to work together,

646
00:42:38,725 --> 00:42:40,495
to really live with each other

647
00:42:40,519 --> 00:42:44,749
and develop a genuine investment
in each other's growth...

648
00:42:44,773 --> 00:42:46,400
that's when it gets good.

649
00:42:47,109 --> 00:42:50,171
Step one is learning
not to sweat the small stuff

650
00:42:50,195 --> 00:42:52,406
and focus on the big goals.

651
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:55,576
You tend to find they're all the same.

652
00:42:56,243 --> 00:43:00,497
Your planet still needs
to make that leap of commonality.

653
00:43:01,331 --> 00:43:02,499
They will.

654
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,644
I won't.

655
00:43:04,668 --> 00:43:07,838
I got it all handed to me in a pretty box.

656
00:43:09,089 --> 00:43:10,775
Part of me feels like...

657
00:43:10,799 --> 00:43:12,318
like I'm abandoning them.

658
00:43:12,342 --> 00:43:15,071
Parachuting out of a falling airplane,

659
00:43:15,095 --> 00:43:17,240
waving at my friends
who are about to die.

660
00:43:17,264 --> 00:43:19,725
I think you're being
a little hard on yourself.

661
00:43:22,352 --> 00:43:24,980
Hey. Do you have weddings on your planet?

662
00:43:25,564 --> 00:43:27,917
- Yeah.
- Well, so do we.

663
00:43:27,941 --> 00:43:30,503
Talla and I are throwing
Claire's bachelorette party next week.

664
00:43:30,527 --> 00:43:31,820
You should come.

665
00:43:32,821 --> 00:43:35,425
Well... I don't wanna
crash it if it's like...

666
00:43:35,449 --> 00:43:36,593
No, you won't be.

667
00:43:36,617 --> 00:43:39,345
We usually synthesize
way too much liquor around here, so...

668
00:43:39,369 --> 00:43:40,972
we could use the help.

669
00:43:40,996 --> 00:43:43,141
Well, you've come
to the right place.

670
00:43:43,165 --> 00:43:45,167
See? I knew I liked you.

671
00:43:46,835 --> 00:43:49,230
You could even help us
put it together if you want.

672
00:43:49,254 --> 00:43:51,715
Might make you feel better
to have a job on the ship.

673
00:43:53,091 --> 00:43:54,384
Thanks, Command...

674
00:43:55,677 --> 00:43:56,803
Kelly.

675
00:44:02,017 --> 00:44:04,537
The diagnostic
is a little behind schedule,

676
00:44:04,561 --> 00:44:06,331
but the forward array is functional.

677
00:44:06,355 --> 00:44:08,666
Scans are operating
at maximum resolution.

678
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:10,710
All right, send Kelly
a full report when you can.

679
00:44:10,734 --> 00:44:12,069
Aye, sir.

680
00:44:13,195 --> 00:44:15,006
He just completely hijacked it!

681
00:44:15,030 --> 00:44:17,175
Right there in front of everybody!

682
00:44:17,199 --> 00:44:19,928
Isaac asked me to be his best man, okay?

683
00:44:19,952 --> 00:44:21,971
And Bortus bullied his way in there.

684
00:44:21,995 --> 00:44:24,807
It was the most self-serving, shameless
thing I've ever seen in my whole life.

685
00:44:24,831 --> 00:44:27,268
- Well, maybe he'll do all right.
- Seriously?

686
00:44:27,292 --> 00:44:30,271
You think there's
a chance in hell he's not gonna suck?

687
00:44:30,295 --> 00:44:33,191
No, it'll be a disaster, but look,
he obviously wants a shot,

688
00:44:33,215 --> 00:44:34,943
and if Isaac's okay with it...

689
00:44:34,967 --> 00:44:36,653
Isaac doesn't know
what the hell he wants.

690
00:44:36,677 --> 00:44:38,446
No, wait, actually he does,

691
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:40,949
and that's why he asked me
to give the speech.

692
00:44:40,973 --> 00:44:45,328
You know, Bortus has this weird,
sneaky craving for the spotlight.

693
00:44:45,352 --> 00:44:46,913
It is so bizarre.

694
00:44:46,937 --> 00:44:50,041
It's like he fancies himself
this charismatic presence

695
00:44:50,065 --> 00:44:51,960
who deserves
to command an audience.

696
00:44:51,984 --> 00:44:54,504
Well, he thinks he can sing,
you're obviously much better than he is,

697
00:44:54,528 --> 00:44:58,466
and if he knows that, he may just be
trying to find some way to...

698
00:44:58,490 --> 00:45:00,134
shine on his own.

699
00:45:00,158 --> 00:45:02,804
I mean, it deserves a little sympathy,
when you think about it.

700
00:45:02,828 --> 00:45:04,138
How good was I at your wedding?

701
00:45:04,162 --> 00:45:05,390
- You were great.
- Wasn't I good?

702
00:45:05,414 --> 00:45:07,433
- You were fantastic.
- Didn't I get a lotta laughs

703
00:45:07,457 --> 00:45:09,018
and then a few misty eyes?

704
00:45:09,042 --> 00:45:11,354
- You did.
- I'm so pissed.

705
00:45:11,378 --> 00:45:15,859
If you had to choose, would you say
you're more or less upset about this

706
00:45:15,883 --> 00:45:17,759
than about the Kaylon invasion of Earth?

707
00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:19,803
I'm madder about this.

708
00:45:25,767 --> 00:45:28,037
Hey, that's my sandwich!

709
00:45:28,061 --> 00:45:29,497
What the hell...?

710
00:45:29,521 --> 00:45:32,417
The sandwich I sent forward in time
three months ago

711
00:45:32,441 --> 00:45:34,669
when we had the Aronov device!

712
00:45:34,693 --> 00:45:36,153
Look at that!

713
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:40,407
I knew I was gonna be happy to see it!

714
00:45:42,784 --> 00:45:43,952
Mm.

715
00:45:45,370 --> 00:45:48,415
You know, I feel better already.

716
00:45:52,419 --> 00:45:55,440
This is a goddamn weird-ass
place we work in, let me tell you.

717
00:46:06,350 --> 00:46:09,787
Okay, so we have
the simulator till 0400, if we need it.

718
00:46:09,811 --> 00:46:11,206
That's pretty optimistic.

719
00:46:11,230 --> 00:46:14,250
Yes, I know. We'll never
keep Claire out past 0100,

720
00:46:14,274 --> 00:46:15,169
but hope springs eternal.

721
00:46:15,193 --> 00:46:17,587
Well, it is her bachelorette,
so who the hell knows?

722
00:46:17,611 --> 00:46:20,381
Now. Big question, entertainment.

723
00:46:20,405 --> 00:46:23,885
It's not a run-of-the-mill ceremony,
so I feel like that should be reflected.

724
00:46:23,909 --> 00:46:25,410
Lysella, what do you think?

725
00:46:26,537 --> 00:46:29,432
- I think...
- whatever you guys think works.

726
00:46:29,456 --> 00:46:31,375
Well, we're open to all suggestions.

727
00:46:32,209 --> 00:46:36,689
And whatever you choose,
the computer just makes it for you, right?

728
00:46:36,713 --> 00:46:38,090
Basically, yeah.

729
00:46:50,143 --> 00:46:51,412
Glass of water.

730
00:46:58,861 --> 00:47:00,338
You know...

731
00:47:00,362 --> 00:47:03,049
just this could change the world
back on my planet.

732
00:47:03,073 --> 00:47:06,034
Even just one
of these synthesizer things.

733
00:47:08,996 --> 00:47:11,164
Why couldn't you help them?

734
00:47:11,707 --> 00:47:14,084
Why couldn't you...
share your technology?

735
00:47:14,710 --> 00:47:17,939
I mean, there are whole countries
that barely have clean water.

736
00:47:17,963 --> 00:47:20,048
This could save millions of lives.

737
00:47:20,632 --> 00:47:23,319
It's not that simple.

738
00:47:23,343 --> 00:47:24,571
Why not?

739
00:47:24,595 --> 00:47:27,681
You could just fly there
and give it to them. Why wouldn't you?

740
00:47:28,182 --> 00:47:31,911
Well, for one thing,
it's against the law.

741
00:47:31,935 --> 00:47:35,373
We're not allowed to drop advanced
technology into a developing society,

742
00:47:35,397 --> 00:47:38,042
like bestowing a gift from heaven.

743
00:47:38,066 --> 00:47:41,921
In fact, that's how our justice system
regards it: Like playing god.

744
00:47:41,945 --> 00:47:44,048
Trust me, that never goes well.

745
00:47:44,072 --> 00:47:48,761
But how can you have something
like this and just keep it for yourselves?

746
00:47:48,785 --> 00:47:52,390
Each of our worlds was ready to use it
responsibly by the time it was developed.

747
00:47:52,414 --> 00:47:54,225
It was available to everyone.

748
00:47:54,249 --> 00:47:57,419
Which is the only way
it could really change the world.

749
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:02,901
Look, if someone had landed on Earth
during our 20th or 21st centuries

750
00:48:02,925 --> 00:48:06,362
and given us something like this,
you know what would've happened?

751
00:48:06,386 --> 00:48:08,805
It wouldn't have been
made available to everyone.

752
00:48:09,473 --> 00:48:13,119
The rich and powerful would've found
a way to exploit it for financial gain.

753
00:48:13,143 --> 00:48:16,414
Someone would have had to benefit
materially from its use.

754
00:48:16,438 --> 00:48:19,501
The idea of everyone benefitting
equally would've been...

755
00:48:19,525 --> 00:48:21,419
inconceivable to them.

756
00:48:21,443 --> 00:48:24,088
Well, you don't know
that my world would do that!

757
00:48:24,112 --> 00:48:26,841
It could be different!
Who are you to make that judgment call?

758
00:48:26,865 --> 00:48:30,011
- Exactly.
- Who are we to decide?

759
00:48:30,035 --> 00:48:33,622
If we're wrong, we could mess
your planet up a thousand times worse.

760
00:48:34,164 --> 00:48:36,142
Technology and societal ethics

761
00:48:36,166 --> 00:48:38,269
have to progress hand in hand,

762
00:48:38,293 --> 00:48:40,980
each one supporting
the other incrementally.

763
00:48:41,004 --> 00:48:43,924
Anything else is begging for disaster.

764
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:48,112
Hey. How about we get back
to the fun stuff?

765
00:48:48,136 --> 00:48:50,532
We have to surprise Claire
with something special at the party.

766
00:48:50,556 --> 00:48:51,866
Right. Let's brainstorm.

767
00:48:51,890 --> 00:48:54,619
You know what,
I'm actually kind of tired.

768
00:48:54,643 --> 00:48:56,204
I think I might just go lay down.

769
00:48:56,228 --> 00:48:58,748
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm...

770
00:48:58,772 --> 00:48:59,958
Yeah.

771
00:48:59,982 --> 00:49:01,608
Thanks, though.

772
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:27,735
This is dead, man.

773
00:49:27,759 --> 00:49:29,654
This whole thing is a complete bust.

774
00:49:29,678 --> 00:49:32,240
Yeah, I thought these things
were supposed to be ragers.

775
00:49:32,264 --> 00:49:34,159
Well, he did his homework, at least.

776
00:49:34,183 --> 00:49:37,412
I mean, this is a pretty
authentic ancient Las Vegas vibe.

777
00:49:37,436 --> 00:49:40,456
I have been informed that
many human events of this variety

778
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:42,292
were celebrated in such a fashion.

779
00:49:42,316 --> 00:49:45,587
- Yeah, but it's lifeless, Isaac.
- I mean, the vibe stinks!

780
00:49:45,611 --> 00:49:48,506
Look, I haven't said
anything up till now, but I'm gonna:

781
00:49:48,530 --> 00:49:51,801
There's still time to make the switch.
I can be your best man.

782
00:49:51,825 --> 00:49:54,929
Commander Bortus
has already begun his preparations.

783
00:49:54,953 --> 00:49:57,682
- What preparations?
- There isn't even a band!

784
00:50:00,125 --> 00:50:02,937
Please welcome the king of rock n' roll...

785
00:50:02,961 --> 00:50:06,524
...Ellllviiiisss!

786
00:50:11,762 --> 00:50:13,198
Hooray!

787
00:50:13,222 --> 00:50:14,949
Hooray for you!

788
00:50:14,973 --> 00:50:16,475
Hooray!

789
00:50:17,684 --> 00:50:19,204
Enough, Klyden!

790
00:50:19,228 --> 00:50:20,437
I must begin.

791
00:50:22,564 --> 00:50:23,708
My apologies.

792
00:50:23,732 --> 00:50:26,735
Sometimes I get carried away
in the moment.

793
00:50:43,627 --> 00:50:46,564
Okay, I've got
four more Quantum Bombs.

794
00:50:46,588 --> 00:50:47,982
Oh! About time!

795
00:50:48,006 --> 00:50:49,275
Thank you!

796
00:50:49,299 --> 00:50:51,611
Cheers to the bride, ladies.

797
00:50:51,635 --> 00:50:56,157
Okay, you actually might keep me
past 0200 tonight.

798
00:50:56,181 --> 00:50:58,868
Okay, wait, Claire, sit down.

799
00:50:58,892 --> 00:51:00,954
- We have a surprise for you.
- Oh, god, what?

800
00:51:00,978 --> 00:51:02,688
Everybody sit, this is gonna be good.

801
00:51:04,982 --> 00:51:08,277
Kelly and I wrote
this program ourselves, so get ready.

802
00:51:19,037 --> 00:51:20,723
Oh, my god!

803
00:51:22,583 --> 00:51:24,501
This is so wrong!

804
00:51:25,878 --> 00:51:27,087
Take it off!

805
00:51:44,813 --> 00:51:46,607
Hey, is Lysella gonna show?

806
00:51:48,025 --> 00:51:49,544
I don't think so.

807
00:51:49,568 --> 00:51:50,670
She okay?

808
00:51:50,694 --> 00:51:54,573
I think it's a harder adjustment for her
than she thought it was gonna be.

809
00:51:55,574 --> 00:51:59,494
You know, I really hope we made
the right move letting her stay.

810
00:52:00,204 --> 00:52:01,514
What else could you do?

811
00:52:01,538 --> 00:52:03,624
I guess. It's just, I...

812
00:52:04,791 --> 00:52:05,935
Oh, my god!

813
00:52:07,586 --> 00:52:09,463
Ohhhhh!

814
00:52:17,638 --> 00:52:20,033
I'll extend the simulator to 0500.

815
00:52:20,057 --> 00:52:21,910
Good plan.

816
00:53:01,265 --> 00:53:02,742
That is all.

817
00:53:02,766 --> 00:53:04,643
You may now go.

818
00:53:23,453 --> 00:53:25,622
Come in.

819
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:28,518
Hey there.

820
00:53:28,542 --> 00:53:30,019
We missed you last night.

821
00:53:30,043 --> 00:53:31,396
Yeah.

822
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:33,755
Sorry I didn't make it.

823
00:53:34,798 --> 00:53:36,300
What's up?

824
00:53:37,509 --> 00:53:39,178
Kelly, I...

825
00:53:40,721 --> 00:53:42,764
I think I need to go home.

826
00:53:49,188 --> 00:53:50,480
Sit down.

827
00:53:59,114 --> 00:54:01,259
I can't do this.

828
00:54:01,283 --> 00:54:03,178
It doesn't feel right.

829
00:54:03,202 --> 00:54:04,929
I feel...

830
00:54:04,953 --> 00:54:06,181
selfish.

831
00:54:06,205 --> 00:54:07,414
Why?

832
00:54:08,165 --> 00:54:09,767
I escaped.

833
00:54:09,791 --> 00:54:13,462
And I left everyone
I know back there to suffer.

834
00:54:14,379 --> 00:54:17,484
I mean, why do I deserve this?

835
00:54:17,508 --> 00:54:19,801
What did I do to be made the exception?

836
00:54:20,594 --> 00:54:22,596
It was just random chance.

837
00:54:23,597 --> 00:54:25,200
Although I can tell you

838
00:54:25,224 --> 00:54:27,684
Commander Lamarr
is probably pretty happy it was you.

839
00:54:30,354 --> 00:54:32,624
Some people would call
what you're feeling...

840
00:54:32,648 --> 00:54:34,358
a form of survivor's guilt.

841
00:54:36,527 --> 00:54:37,694
I just...

842
00:54:38,737 --> 00:54:40,239
I need to go back.

843
00:54:50,999 --> 00:54:52,393
What do we think?

844
00:54:52,417 --> 00:54:55,212
- I like the other one.
- I think this neckline is too high.

845
00:54:55,754 --> 00:54:57,941
Oh, yeah, maybe, huh?

846
00:54:57,965 --> 00:54:59,484
Eh... Captain?

847
00:54:59,508 --> 00:55:01,194
I think it looks great.

848
00:55:01,218 --> 00:55:03,095
Do you like the other one
better than this?

849
00:55:04,054 --> 00:55:05,639
Display option B.

850
00:55:10,477 --> 00:55:12,413
- Yeah, I like that one too.
- I think they're both great.

851
00:55:12,437 --> 00:55:15,834
- Oh, come on!
- Isn't Kelly better equipped to...

852
00:55:15,858 --> 00:55:17,502
I want to know what you think too!

853
00:55:17,526 --> 00:55:19,754
I think it's whatever you like.

854
00:55:19,778 --> 00:55:21,214
Sir, I think she wants an opinion.

855
00:55:21,238 --> 00:55:23,800
That is my opinion. I-I like 'em all.

856
00:55:24,867 --> 00:55:26,469
What? She looks great in everything!
Why is that bad?

857
00:55:26,493 --> 00:55:30,181
- It's not bad, it's just...
- with all due respect, it's useless.

858
00:55:30,205 --> 00:55:32,791
- Okay, fine, we can agree I'm useless.
- Can I go now?

859
00:55:33,709 --> 00:55:36,146
- Hey. You guys got a minute?
- Yes.

860
00:55:36,170 --> 00:55:38,755
Oh, wow, I love this dress.

861
00:55:39,798 --> 00:55:42,026
- What? That's exactly what I just said.
- I said I love it.

862
00:55:42,050 --> 00:55:44,028
It's the way you said it,
it was just sort of general.

863
00:55:44,052 --> 00:55:46,156
I said it exactly
the same way Kelly did.

864
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:48,307
Lysella has decided
that she wants to go home.

865
00:55:49,892 --> 00:55:53,413
Oh, man.

866
00:55:53,437 --> 00:55:54,664
What happened?

867
00:55:54,688 --> 00:55:58,960
Short version: She feels
like she's abandoning her world

868
00:55:58,984 --> 00:56:00,753
and she's been whisked off to the stars

869
00:56:00,777 --> 00:56:03,423
while everyone she knows
is still down in the mud.

870
00:56:03,447 --> 00:56:05,133
She can't reconcile it.

871
00:56:05,157 --> 00:56:06,617
Isn't it too late?

872
00:56:07,117 --> 00:56:09,286
Ed, what do you think?

873
00:56:10,287 --> 00:56:13,725
Well, she's... been here
a lot longer this time.

874
00:56:13,749 --> 00:56:15,143
She's seen a lot more.

875
00:56:15,167 --> 00:56:16,394
True.

876
00:56:16,418 --> 00:56:19,731
Although it's still just a story
once she's back home.

877
00:56:19,755 --> 00:56:21,691
Well, you're the one
that's been spending time with her.

878
00:56:21,715 --> 00:56:22,859
Let me ask you this:

879
00:56:22,883 --> 00:56:26,303
If you had to make this call on your own,
what would you do?

880
00:56:29,431 --> 00:56:30,617
Look...

881
00:56:30,641 --> 00:56:32,851
this girl is just confused.

882
00:56:33,727 --> 00:56:37,689
She's young, she thought
she was choosing adventure, but...

883
00:56:38,357 --> 00:56:41,044
her conscience is pouring
a little cold water on it.

884
00:56:41,068 --> 00:56:42,378
What about the risk?

885
00:56:42,402 --> 00:56:45,840
- My opinion?
- She's not an engineer.

886
00:56:45,864 --> 00:56:48,551
I mean,
we found her working in a cafe.

887
00:56:48,575 --> 00:56:50,762
It's not like she can go back
and build a simulator

888
00:56:50,786 --> 00:56:52,138
just because she's seen one.

889
00:56:52,162 --> 00:56:57,000
She could describe it, but I'm sure
every fiction writer could too.

890
00:56:57,793 --> 00:56:59,604
Even if anyone believed her,

891
00:56:59,628 --> 00:57:01,839
they'd still have to
figure it out for themselves.

892
00:57:04,842 --> 00:57:06,969
Make sure she knows this is it.

893
00:57:07,594 --> 00:57:09,113
The Orville is not a passenger liner

894
00:57:09,137 --> 00:57:11,658
that's gonna be back to pick her up
if she changes her mind again.

895
00:57:11,682 --> 00:57:13,517
She has to be sure about this.

896
00:57:15,477 --> 00:57:17,229
I'll take care of it.

897
00:57:49,219 --> 00:57:51,638
All aboard, ready for takeoff.

898
00:57:52,848 --> 00:57:54,534
Thank you again.

899
00:57:54,558 --> 00:57:56,244
For everything.

900
00:57:56,268 --> 00:57:57,936
Take care of yourself.

901
00:58:11,450 --> 00:58:12,618
Lysella.

902
00:58:14,119 --> 00:58:15,471
What?

903
00:58:15,495 --> 00:58:17,164
Can I have a look in your bag?

904
00:58:18,290 --> 00:58:19,475
Why?

905
00:58:19,499 --> 00:58:21,084
I think you know why.

906
00:58:23,128 --> 00:58:24,606
Kelly, please.

907
00:58:24,630 --> 00:58:25,982
Open the bag, Lysella.

908
00:58:26,006 --> 00:58:28,443
- I can convince them!
- I know we can do it right!

909
00:58:28,467 --> 00:58:30,069
I'll make sure they don't take advantage...

910
00:58:30,093 --> 00:58:33,722
Whether you can or you can't,
I'm not authorized to let you try.

911
00:58:36,141 --> 00:58:37,726
Give me the com scanner.

912
00:58:55,244 --> 00:58:57,180
Synthesizers, environmental simulators,

913
00:58:57,204 --> 00:58:58,681
scanner arrays...

914
00:58:58,705 --> 00:59:01,559
No weapons specs,
you get credit for that.

915
00:59:01,583 --> 00:59:03,877
I told you I only want to help.

916
00:59:05,295 --> 00:59:08,173
- Come with me.
- I want to show you something.

917
00:59:21,979 --> 00:59:23,706
Please select a program.

918
00:59:23,730 --> 00:59:27,943
- Gendel Three.
- Circa 2235, standard calendar.

919
00:59:38,912 --> 00:59:41,224
This is the third planet
in the Gendel system,

920
00:59:41,248 --> 00:59:43,417
about 600 light-years from your world.

921
00:59:46,712 --> 00:59:48,189
It...

922
00:59:48,213 --> 00:59:50,007
doesn't look all that different.

923
00:59:51,049 --> 00:59:52,968
No, it doesn't.

924
00:59:53,468 --> 00:59:55,321
Except they reached
this level of industrialization

925
00:59:55,345 --> 00:59:57,490
almost 200 years before you did.

926
00:59:57,514 --> 01:00:00,517
This is how their world looked
early in the 23rd century.

927
01:00:02,769 --> 01:00:05,606
Advance timeline to 2240.

928
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:29,272
This is Gendel Three...

929
01:00:29,296 --> 01:00:30,923
five years later.

930
01:00:33,217 --> 01:00:34,676
What happened?

931
01:00:36,345 --> 01:00:38,055
We did.

932
01:00:51,527 --> 01:00:54,363
When the early Union explorers
reached out into space,

933
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:58,116
they acted more like
missionaries than observers.

934
01:00:58,825 --> 01:01:02,371
Not in the religious sense, there was
no proselytizing or anything like that.

935
01:01:03,455 --> 01:01:04,957
But they wanted to help.

936
01:01:06,708 --> 01:01:11,189
When they got to Gendel Three,
they found a divided world,

937
01:01:11,213 --> 01:01:13,316
bristling with nuclear weapons,

938
01:01:13,340 --> 01:01:16,134
continents sliced up
by national borders.

939
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:18,220
So they landed.

940
01:01:19,388 --> 01:01:23,976
They revealed themselves,
their technology, everything.

941
01:01:25,227 --> 01:01:27,437
They figured it was the right thing to do,

942
01:01:28,146 --> 01:01:32,418
that maybe they could help this planet
skip over the nasty growing pains

943
01:01:32,442 --> 01:01:34,945
that all worlds seem
to have to go through.

944
01:01:36,864 --> 01:01:38,949
But they couldn't control the spread.

945
01:01:40,075 --> 01:01:44,931
Nation-states fought each other,
wars broke out everywhere,

946
01:01:44,955 --> 01:01:48,309
because they all wanted
to use the advancements for personal gain

947
01:01:48,333 --> 01:01:50,294
and for political dominance.

948
01:01:52,379 --> 01:01:54,882
They wiped themselves out in five years.

949
01:01:56,008 --> 01:01:58,302
Nine billion people.

950
01:01:59,052 --> 01:02:00,304
Gone.

951
01:02:02,556 --> 01:02:05,934
After that, new laws were put in place.

952
01:02:06,518 --> 01:02:09,688
Strict prohibitions when it came
to cultural contamination.

953
01:02:12,065 --> 01:02:13,901
And all they tried to do was help.

954
01:02:22,159 --> 01:02:24,244
You can still go back if you want to.

955
01:02:24,870 --> 01:02:27,497
But you can't pull them into the future.

956
01:02:28,415 --> 01:02:30,375
They have to do it on their own.

957
01:02:52,773 --> 01:02:57,086
Captain. Scans are detecting
a large fleet approaching at quantum.

958
01:02:57,110 --> 01:02:59,130
Point two-nine light-years and closing.

959
01:02:59,154 --> 01:03:00,280
Identify.

960
01:03:00,906 --> 01:03:03,408
They appear to be... Kaylon.

961
01:03:04,451 --> 01:03:05,553
How many vessels?

962
01:03:05,577 --> 01:03:07,263
Approximately 4,000.

963
01:03:07,287 --> 01:03:09,849
- Oh, my god. We've been tricked.
- They're coming.

964
01:03:09,873 --> 01:03:13,394
Captain.
Those are my wedding guests.

965
01:03:13,418 --> 01:03:15,396
- What?
- Isaac.

966
01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:16,981
Did you invite the whole planet?

967
01:03:17,005 --> 01:03:18,173
Affirmative.

968
01:03:18,882 --> 01:03:20,568
Dr. Finn, please report to the bridge.

969
01:03:20,592 --> 01:03:24,864
Talla, please alert Union Central
so nobody scans the region and panics.

970
01:03:24,888 --> 01:03:26,181
Aye, sir.

971
01:03:45,242 --> 01:03:47,870
- Sir, the lead ship is hailing us.
- Put 'em on.

972
01:03:48,871 --> 01:03:51,933
Primary. This is a surprise.

973
01:03:51,957 --> 01:03:54,793
We are here
for the matrimonial ceremony.

974
01:03:55,961 --> 01:03:59,357
Isaac, you can't fit
all those Kaylon in the simulator!

975
01:03:59,381 --> 01:04:00,549
Are you insane?

976
01:04:02,176 --> 01:04:06,197
Primary. We will be unable
to accommodate your entire complement.

977
01:04:06,221 --> 01:04:09,951
However, we will arrange
for visual transmission to your vessels.

978
01:04:09,975 --> 01:04:11,953
That will be acceptable.

979
01:04:11,977 --> 01:04:15,707
And... congratulations, Isaac.

980
01:04:15,731 --> 01:04:17,441
Thank you, Primary.

981
01:06:03,881 --> 01:06:05,549
You may be seated.

982
01:06:10,470 --> 01:06:12,448
One of the great privileges

983
01:06:12,472 --> 01:06:15,785
that has always been bestowed
upon ships captains

984
01:06:15,809 --> 01:06:19,080
since the days
of the ancient seafaring vessels

985
01:06:19,104 --> 01:06:22,983
is the honor of uniting
two people in matrimony.

986
01:06:24,443 --> 01:06:29,716
Claire and Isaac
have been with us all for a long time.

987
01:06:29,740 --> 01:06:33,636
We have watched
their bond develop and grow,

988
01:06:33,660 --> 01:06:36,723
through good times and bad.

989
01:06:36,747 --> 01:06:41,084
But through it all,
that bond has endured.

990
01:06:42,419 --> 01:06:46,065
The bride and the groom
have written their own vows.

991
01:06:46,089 --> 01:06:47,257
Claire?

992
01:06:52,429 --> 01:06:56,600
Some women shut their eyes and dream.

993
01:06:57,392 --> 01:06:59,978
Others open their eyes and hope.

994
01:07:01,355 --> 01:07:04,650
Dreams are what you create for yourself.

995
01:07:05,526 --> 01:07:09,988
Hope lets the universe decide for you.

996
01:07:11,615 --> 01:07:14,785
I'm glad that I opened my eyes.

997
01:07:16,495 --> 01:07:18,598
You have touched me

998
01:07:18,622 --> 01:07:23,043
in a way that no human ever could.

999
01:07:25,003 --> 01:07:29,132
I can't wait to spend the rest
of my life with you.

1000
01:07:35,597 --> 01:07:36,890
Isaac?

1001
01:07:38,141 --> 01:07:41,562
I am unable to reciprocate your love.

1002
01:07:42,437 --> 01:07:45,500
However, the only occasion

1003
01:07:45,524 --> 01:07:49,087
upon which I have ever made
an error in judgment

1004
01:07:49,111 --> 01:07:53,883
was 21 hours, 7 minutes, and 14 seconds

1005
01:07:53,907 --> 01:07:56,577
after you terminated our coupling.

1006
01:07:57,202 --> 01:08:00,372
I cannot experience affection.

1007
01:08:01,123 --> 01:08:06,712
However, I prefer not
to experience... error.

1008
01:08:08,130 --> 01:08:09,941
It is possible

1009
01:08:09,965 --> 01:08:14,344
you will ensure my continued efficiency.

1010
01:08:42,247 --> 01:08:43,975
Isaac.

1011
01:08:43,999 --> 01:08:47,377
Do you take Claire to be
your lawfully wedded wife?

1012
01:08:58,180 --> 01:08:59,598
I do.

1013
01:09:01,725 --> 01:09:03,495
And, Claire.

1014
01:09:03,519 --> 01:09:06,980
Do you take Isaac to be
your lawfully wedded husband?

1015
01:09:14,446 --> 01:09:15,864
I do.

1016
01:09:19,034 --> 01:09:23,515
Then, by the authority vested in me
by the Planetary Union,

1017
01:09:23,539 --> 01:09:26,625
I now pronounce you man and wife.

1018
01:09:27,543 --> 01:09:29,813
You may kiss the bride.

1019
01:09:44,810 --> 01:09:46,103
Whoo-hoo!

1020
01:10:25,559 --> 01:10:27,203
Hey there, Lysella!

1021
01:10:27,227 --> 01:10:28,997
Congratulations, Doctor.

1022
01:10:29,021 --> 01:10:30,290
Oh! Thank you.

1023
01:10:30,314 --> 01:10:31,481
How are you doing?

1024
01:10:32,232 --> 01:10:34,377
- Better.
- I know it was a hard choice.

1025
01:10:34,401 --> 01:10:36,171
I'm happy you're staying with us.

1026
01:10:36,195 --> 01:10:39,132
Yeah. It's... It's gonna be
a big learning curve, but...

1027
01:10:39,156 --> 01:10:40,717
I got the right coach.

1028
01:10:40,741 --> 01:10:43,678
- She'll do fine.
- Consider her my adopted little sister.

1029
01:10:43,702 --> 01:10:45,471
Have you met the Kaylon yet?

1030
01:10:45,495 --> 01:10:46,806
No, I haven't.

1031
01:10:46,830 --> 01:10:49,517
If you wish, I will introduce you.

1032
01:10:49,541 --> 01:10:52,312
Yeah, that'd be... interesting.

1033
01:10:52,336 --> 01:10:53,587
Come on.

1034
01:10:54,796 --> 01:10:57,090
You think Isaac's a trip, get ready.

1035
01:11:04,014 --> 01:11:05,307
Amazing.

1036
01:11:05,807 --> 01:11:09,186
A year ago we were blowing up
each other's armadas and now look at this.

1037
01:11:09,728 --> 01:11:11,289
I was just thinking that.

1038
01:11:11,313 --> 01:11:12,749
It's crazy, isn't it?

1039
01:11:12,773 --> 01:11:15,043
Bridge to Captain.

1040
01:11:15,067 --> 01:11:16,044
Go ahead.

1041
01:11:16,068 --> 01:11:18,838
The transport has docked
and she's on her way down to you.

1042
01:11:18,862 --> 01:11:20,507
Great.

1043
01:11:20,531 --> 01:11:22,091
What's that about?

1044
01:11:22,115 --> 01:11:23,867
A little surprise.

1045
01:11:47,891 --> 01:11:49,869
- Alara!
- Whoo!

1046
01:11:52,479 --> 01:11:53,498
Hi, Isaac.

1047
01:11:53,522 --> 01:11:55,083
I can't believe you're here!

1048
01:11:55,107 --> 01:11:56,292
- Surprise!
- Hey!

1049
01:11:56,316 --> 01:11:57,836
- You made it.
- Welcome back.

1050
01:11:57,860 --> 01:11:59,087
So good to see you!

1051
01:11:59,111 --> 01:12:01,005
Oh, my god, you came
all this way just for us?

1052
01:12:01,029 --> 01:12:04,342
- Oh, come on, you're like family.
- Thank you so much.

1053
01:12:04,366 --> 01:12:06,052
I'm so sorry I missed the ceremony.

1054
01:12:06,076 --> 01:12:08,555
I really wanted to be there,
but I got held up at the conference.

1055
01:12:08,579 --> 01:12:10,932
Yeah, I heard you were
working out tactical parameters

1056
01:12:10,956 --> 01:12:13,017
for Selayan outpost design,
congratulations.

1057
01:12:13,041 --> 01:12:16,521
Well, I've got a bit of a climb
up the ladder before things get good,

1058
01:12:16,545 --> 01:12:19,232
but I'm moving faster than I expected.

1059
01:12:19,256 --> 01:12:21,067
- Hey there!
- Hi, Talla!

1060
01:12:21,091 --> 01:12:23,236
How's my old seat?
You taking care of it?

1061
01:12:23,260 --> 01:12:25,029
Couple of scratches
that weren't there before,

1062
01:12:25,053 --> 01:12:26,364
otherwise just how you left it.

1063
01:12:26,388 --> 01:12:29,159
Alara, I know
you only have a limited time

1064
01:12:29,183 --> 01:12:31,018
in off-world gravity each year.

1065
01:12:32,186 --> 01:12:34,205
It means a lot that you've joined us.

1066
01:12:36,106 --> 01:12:39,526
And you got here just in time
to watch things go off the rails.

1067
01:12:40,027 --> 01:12:41,195
What do you mean?

1068
01:12:43,530 --> 01:12:45,592
May I have your attention.

1069
01:12:54,291 --> 01:12:56,126
Attention, please!

1070
01:13:02,216 --> 01:13:03,550
You will be silent!

1071
01:13:07,554 --> 01:13:10,599
I will now give the wedding toast.

1072
01:13:11,099 --> 01:13:15,497
In human tradition, this consists
of a series of good-natured jabs,

1073
01:13:15,521 --> 01:13:17,415
followed by earnest wishes.

1074
01:13:17,439 --> 01:13:20,668
- I told him that. Like, verbatim.
- This is such crap.

1075
01:13:20,692 --> 01:13:22,670
Dr. Finn.

1076
01:13:22,694 --> 01:13:27,342
Many crew members have privately
frowned upon your mating with Isaac.

1077
01:13:27,366 --> 01:13:29,511
They feel it will not succeed.

1078
01:13:29,535 --> 01:13:33,080
All kidding aside, I wish you well.

1079
01:13:34,331 --> 01:13:35,517
Isaac.

1080
01:13:35,541 --> 01:13:37,018
You betrayed us.

1081
01:13:37,042 --> 01:13:40,230
Your actions caused
the destruction of many ships

1082
01:13:40,254 --> 01:13:42,130
and the deaths of many people.

1083
01:13:43,006 --> 01:13:46,778
All kidding aside,
congratulations on this day.

1084
01:13:46,802 --> 01:13:48,863
He is very good!

1085
01:13:48,887 --> 01:13:50,156
Dr. Finn.

1086
01:13:50,180 --> 01:13:52,492
I do not believe an artificial life form

1087
01:13:52,516 --> 01:13:55,102
is capable of properly
raising your children.

1088
01:13:55,727 --> 01:13:58,498
He will most likely fail in this attempt.

1089
01:13:58,522 --> 01:14:00,416
All kidding aside...

1090
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:01,608
Commander Bortus.

1091
01:14:02,901 --> 01:14:07,298
Thank you
for your well-prepared address.

1092
01:14:07,322 --> 01:14:11,326
I would like to hear
what Lieutenant Malloy has to say.

1093
01:14:13,495 --> 01:14:14,663
Lieutenant.

1094
01:14:15,330 --> 01:14:16,790
Oh!

1095
01:14:17,958 --> 01:14:19,126
Oh... Okay.

1096
01:14:20,377 --> 01:14:21,980
Yeah.

1097
01:14:24,423 --> 01:14:26,925
Excuse me, excuse me.

1098
01:14:29,344 --> 01:14:30,488
Um, hey!

1099
01:14:30,512 --> 01:14:33,056
Hey, how about a big hand
for Bortus, everyone?

1100
01:14:35,309 --> 01:14:37,227
Hooray!

1101
01:14:38,937 --> 01:14:40,063
Okay.

1102
01:14:41,273 --> 01:14:43,525
I got it. I got it.

1103
01:14:45,611 --> 01:14:47,922
I-I wish I had prepared
something in advance,

1104
01:14:47,946 --> 01:14:49,781
but I'll do my best.

1105
01:14:50,324 --> 01:14:52,343
Well, um...

1106
01:14:52,367 --> 01:14:55,680
it's a big day, and a happy day.

1107
01:14:55,704 --> 01:14:58,999
And there's a lot of big life changes
in store for Claire and Isaac.

1108
01:15:00,667 --> 01:15:05,106
First off, I'd like to congratulate them
on moving 50 meters closer together.

1109
01:15:07,341 --> 01:15:10,153
I guess it's safe to say
that marriage is gonna be easy

1110
01:15:10,177 --> 01:15:12,530
compared to what
we've all been through together.

1111
01:15:12,554 --> 01:15:15,617
Although it is marriage to Isaac,
so maybe not.

1112
01:15:17,684 --> 01:15:20,538
The fact that Claire is my doctor
and she's seen me naked

1113
01:15:20,562 --> 01:15:25,543
and is still marrying another man
is incredibly insulting, but...

1114
01:15:27,945 --> 01:15:31,090
...I bow to the victor.
Well done, Isaac.

1115
01:15:31,114 --> 01:15:33,885
Anyway... I'll keep this short

1116
01:15:33,909 --> 01:15:36,429
because I know the Kaylon have, like,
a thousand light-year drive home,

1117
01:15:36,453 --> 01:15:37,931
and most of them have been drinking.

1118
01:15:40,415 --> 01:15:42,519
But, um...

1119
01:15:42,543 --> 01:15:45,939
I just want to say that both of you

1120
01:15:45,963 --> 01:15:48,674
mean a lot to this entire crew.

1121
01:15:49,508 --> 01:15:51,569
We've served together,

1122
01:15:51,593 --> 01:15:53,404
we've laughed together,

1123
01:15:53,428 --> 01:15:56,199
and we all owe each other our lives.

1124
01:15:56,223 --> 01:15:57,724
So...

1125
01:15:58,392 --> 01:16:00,352
when two of us find love with each other,

1126
01:16:02,062 --> 01:16:03,689
we all feel it together.

1127
01:16:04,815 --> 01:16:06,733
And it's a very special thing.

1128
01:16:08,819 --> 01:16:10,612
So, um...

1129
01:16:13,949 --> 01:16:17,679
I wish the two of you
a long, happy marriage.

1130
01:16:17,703 --> 01:16:19,931
I know it's gonna be a huge success,

1131
01:16:19,955 --> 01:16:23,017
and if it's not, the good news is,
Isaac is fully recyclable.

1132
01:16:28,755 --> 01:16:30,733
Here's to you both. Cheers.

1133
01:16:30,757 --> 01:16:32,861
Cheers!

1134
01:16:34,928 --> 01:16:38,348
Yeah!

1135
01:16:39,266 --> 01:16:40,952
Go on, now.

1136
01:16:40,976 --> 01:16:42,269
Okay.

1137
01:16:44,813 --> 01:16:47,208
Gordon. That was beautiful.

1138
01:16:47,232 --> 01:16:49,484
Uh... Would you sing a song for us?

1139
01:16:50,110 --> 01:16:51,963
Uh... right now?

1140
01:16:51,987 --> 01:16:53,715
- Yeah.
- Right, guys?

1141
01:16:53,739 --> 01:16:56,259
- Yeah! Come on!
- Come on, Gordon, sing us a song!

1142
01:16:56,283 --> 01:16:58,118
Uh... okay.

1143
01:17:00,662 --> 01:17:01,830
All right.

1144
01:17:04,041 --> 01:17:06,269
Hey, uh, can I borrow that?

1145
01:17:06,293 --> 01:17:08,128
Vlakashmool.

1146
01:17:09,305 --> 01:18:09,553
