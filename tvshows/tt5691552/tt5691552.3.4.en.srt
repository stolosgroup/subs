2
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,938
- I was born in a time of dreams.

3
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:25,376
We were pure of spirit
and devout in our beliefs.

4
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,838
The blessings of Avis
were showered upon us

5
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:31,883
and brought our greatest hopes to life.

6
00:00:31,907 --> 00:00:36,495
But now we face a looming nightmare.

7
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:40,808
We brought this nightmare
upon ourselves

8
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:45,146
when we placed our fate
into the hands of a false prophet.

9
00:00:49,091 --> 00:00:51,694
Supreme Chancellor Korin

10
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:55,323
has turned his back
on everything we hold sacred.

11
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:00,703
At this very moment,

12
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:04,082
he consorts with our enemies
a thousand light-years away,

13
00:01:04,106 --> 00:01:08,670
negotiating a treaty
with the Planetary Union,

14
00:01:08,694 --> 00:01:13,282
a treaty
that will imperil our civilization.

15
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:22,207
The Chancellor would have you believe
that this treaty protects us.

16
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:26,753
But in truth, it weakens us.

17
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:32,009
It demands we surrender
our divine right to expand our territory.

18
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:39,391
It forces us to protect other worlds
at the risk of our own...

19
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:44,730
to spill our blood,

20
00:01:45,314 --> 00:01:49,443
to expend our resources
for their benefit!

21
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:58,911
If this treaty is ratified,
what will they demand next?

22
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:02,998
More of their ships in our space?

23
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:08,420
Their politicians
interfering in our affairs?

24
00:02:10,214 --> 00:02:14,676
The inevitable erosion
of our ideals and our identity?

25
00:02:16,512 --> 00:02:19,890
Where will it end?

26
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:28,374
When you go home to your children,

27
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:31,735
will you tell them you chose
to destroy our future?

28
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:39,302
Or will you tell them
you have reclaimed our dreams

29
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:43,205
and placed your trust
in the word of Avis?

30
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:47,018
A word which declares...

31
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:49,336
that Krill comes first!

32
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:02,575
Place your faith in me
as your Supreme Chancellor,

33
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:06,019
and I will end this madness!

34
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:12,836
And those responsible
will pay for their treason!

- Did you enjoy your evening
on Broadway, Chancellor?

50
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:22,525
- Indeed.

51
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:27,596
However, the repeated prophecy
of the orphan child was quite haunting.

52
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:32,243
"The sun will come out... tomorrow."

53
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:36,289
- In our culture, the sun
is a symbol of suffering and death.

54
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:40,084
- Yes, in retrospect, "Oklahoma!"
might've been a better choice.

55
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:43,588
- The performance depicted a time
of tremendous hardship in your history.

56
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:46,841
For how long did
your world endure this catastrophe?

57
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:49,886
- The Great Depression.
It lasted over a decade.

58
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:53,681
- Sadly, those kinds of societal collapses
used to be pretty common.

59
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:57,519
- It wasn't until we advanced beyond
the need to buy and sell things

60
00:06:57,543 --> 00:06:59,813
that our world became
a more stable place.

61
00:06:59,837 --> 00:07:03,024
- The Merchant Class is the backbone
of our civilization.

62
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:07,320
And our society has been stable
for tens of thousands of years.

63
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:10,698
What you lack is divine guidance.

64
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:14,118
- All things considered, I'd say
we're doing pretty well these days.

65
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:16,246
- And yet, in the face
of the Kaylon threat,

66
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,581
you come to us begging for salvation.

67
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:19,749
- Pakor!

68
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:23,044
- Well, with all due respect,
I wouldn't exactly call it begging.

69
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:26,422
There's a clear
and obvious mutual advantage here.

70
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,800
- The treaty is not just
for our advantage,

71
00:07:28,824 --> 00:07:30,426
but for yours as well.

72
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,511
The Kaylon threat...

73
00:07:31,535 --> 00:07:33,346
- The Kaylon will be defeated.

74
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,807
Our fighting forces are unequaled.

75
00:07:35,831 --> 00:07:40,294
- But... our combined forces
will ensure success.

76
00:07:40,878 --> 00:07:46,526
When the threat is existential,
one cannot afford a margin for error.

77
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:47,759
- A toast.

78
00:07:49,261 --> 00:07:54,183
To our combined forces
and the salvation of all our worlds.

79
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:00,665
- It's been a pleasure hosting you,
Chancellor.

80
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:04,460
Perhaps one day
a Union delegation can visit Krill.

81
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:08,339
- We would be most pleased
to return your generosity.

82
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:10,675
Once the details are finalized,

83
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:16,514
I propose we sign the treaty
in our glorious capital city of Dalakos.

84
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:21,895
And we will celebrate my re-instatement
as Supreme Chancellor.

85
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,938
- It would be our great honor.

86
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:27,400
I've... been meaning
to ask about that, if I may.

87
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:30,469
You seem very certain of your victory.

88
00:08:31,053 --> 00:08:34,157
- My opponent is a divisive figure

89
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:36,350
who exploits fear and ignorance.

90
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:41,372
She has a devout following,
but it is insignificant.

91
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:45,543
- Our projections show
that Chancellor Korin will prevail.

92
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:49,589
- Once the people of Krill
see you for themselves, as I have,

93
00:08:49,613 --> 00:08:55,094
they will understand you are not
the soulless monsters

94
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:57,764
my opponent would have them believe.

95
00:08:57,788 --> 00:09:01,226
- Well, at the risk of getting us
all drunk on toasts,

96
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:04,521
here's to your victory, Chancellor.

97
00:09:04,545 --> 00:09:07,357
And to a new era of long-lasting peace.

98
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:08,298
- Hear, hear!

99
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,512
♪  ♪

100
00:09:18,976 --> 00:09:21,746
- Aww, man, y'know,
that makes me miss your moustache.

101
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,915
Oh, my God,
you had a moustache?

102
00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:25,500
- Oh, yeah, it was amazing.

103
00:09:25,524 --> 00:09:27,752
- I thought Moclans
didn't grow facial hair.

104
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:30,922
- Doctor Finn was able
to stimulate growth.

105
00:09:30,946 --> 00:09:33,633
- What about the Hippocratic Oath,
"First do no harm"?

106
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:35,134
- Wait a minute, how is that harm?

107
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:36,427
- It's a moustache.

108
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:39,162
She's got us there.

109
00:09:39,705 --> 00:09:43,560
- Whoa! Commander, you might wanna
pace yourself, we're only in the 1800s.

110
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:45,311
- Eh, don't worry about me, I'll make it.

111
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:47,355
- Have you been through
the whole simulation?

112
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:50,525
- Almost. The pub crawl through history
is a classic in my family.

113
00:09:50,549 --> 00:09:54,612
My dad once made it from ancient Greece
all the way to the Water Wars.

114
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:57,282
- I've gotta say, I've never
understood the "pub crawl."

115
00:09:57,306 --> 00:09:58,491
We're here, we're drinking.

116
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:01,202
The booze is gonna be
exactly the same at the next place.

117
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:03,830
Let's just stay here,
we're enjoying ourselves.

118
00:10:03,854 --> 00:10:07,608
- Hey. Here's to your promotion.
Lieutenant Commander Keyali.

119
00:10:08,317 --> 00:10:10,211
It's got a nice ring to it.
- Thanks, John.

120
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:12,630
Best part is, I don't have
to call you "sir" anymore.

121
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:15,300
- That's fine by me.
Kinda like hearing you use my name.

122
00:10:15,324 --> 00:10:17,260
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

123
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:19,077
Wouldn't mind hearing it
more often, actually.

124
00:10:19,745 --> 00:10:21,246
- Are you trying to tell me something?

125
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:24,082
- Oh, my God.

126
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:28,813
This town will not accommodate

127
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:32,275
the numerical totality
of our combined mass.

128
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:34,652
- Well, it was fun while it lasted.

129
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:36,529
Bridge to Captain.

130
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:37,655
- Go ahead.

131
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:40,033
I have Admiral Halsey
on a priority-one channel

132
00:10:40,057 --> 00:10:41,743
for you and Commander Grayson.

133
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:42,976
- We're on our way.

134
00:10:48,774 --> 00:10:51,503
- So this is actually happening?
Like it's a done deal?

135
00:10:51,527 --> 00:10:53,046
- Everything but the ink.

136
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:56,299
The last few outstanding points
were finalized about an hour ago.

137
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:59,302
- Admiral, I gotta say,
congratulations to all of you.

138
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:01,387
This... This is huge.

139
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:04,057
- Well, you and your crew should
congratulate yourselves as well.

140
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:07,227
The Orville played a critical role
leading up to this achievement.

141
00:11:07,251 --> 00:11:08,561
I'm proud of you.

142
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:09,896
- Thank you, sir.

143
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,525
- The treaty signing will take place
in Dalakos in one week.

144
00:11:13,549 --> 00:11:14,984
- Dalakos?

145
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:16,110
On Krill?

146
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:21,074
- President Alcuzan has been invited,
along with Senator Balask and myself.

147
00:11:21,098 --> 00:11:24,685
And I've requested The Orville
for transport duty.

148
00:11:25,561 --> 00:11:28,289
- Really?
- You'll be among the first Union officers

149
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:30,166
ever to set foot on Krill.

150
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:33,503
- Sir, this is... this is amazing.

151
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:34,921
We're so grateful.

152
00:11:34,945 --> 00:11:36,714
- Don't be, you've earned it.

153
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:39,968
You'll head back to Earth immediately
to pick up the delegation.

154
00:11:39,992 --> 00:11:42,428
Saddle up, you've got a long ride.

155
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:44,288
Halsey out.

156
00:11:44,872 --> 00:11:47,499
- Oh, my God.
- This is unbelievable.

157
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,520
- You know what the best part is?
- What?

158
00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:52,313

It's so good to finally meet you.

162
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:32,836

is all mine, Mr. President.

163

- And you must be Commander Grayson.

164
00:12:36,548 --> 00:12:39,194
I've heard great things
from Admiral Halsey.

165
00:12:39,218 --> 00:12:41,362
We both admired your father very much.

166
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:43,680
- Thank you, Mr. President.
I know he felt the same.

167
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,784
- Well, I appreciate the honor guard,

168
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:48,578
but, uh, you didn't have to go
to the trouble.

169
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:50,246
- It's no trouble, sir.

170
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:53,041
This is my Chief of Security,
Commander Talla Keyali.

171
00:12:53,065 --> 00:12:54,792
- Your team is impressive, Commander.

172
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:56,044
- Thank you, sir.

173
00:12:56,068 --> 00:12:58,755
It's not every day I get to show them off
for a group like this.

174
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:00,965
- If you're ready to get settled,
we'll show you to your quarters.

175
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:02,241
- Ah, wonderful.

176
00:13:03,951 --> 00:13:05,261
- Ed.

177
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:07,913
Before we get underway,
there's something you should know.

178
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:09,516
About the election.

179
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,476
- What is it?

180
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:17,148
- What they call a treaty,
I call a capitulation of cowards!

181
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:26,699
Their Union is a patchwork alliance
of hundreds of species

182
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:30,870
that long ago surrendered
their identities to this...

183
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:34,874
this social collective
that rapes them of their purity.

184
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:39,963
Would you let them do the same to us?

185
00:13:39,987 --> 00:13:42,257
No!

186
00:13:42,281 --> 00:13:44,491
- Make no mistake.

187
00:13:45,075 --> 00:13:47,679
The outstretched hand of welcome

188
00:13:47,703 --> 00:13:50,890
will quickly become
the fist of oppression.

189
00:13:51,915 --> 00:13:57,105
We must kill this treaty
and reclaim our rightful place

190
00:13:57,129 --> 00:14:00,567
as the dominant force in this galaxy.

191
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:12,120
- After you released Teleya to the Krill,
she quit the military.

192
00:14:12,144 --> 00:14:13,913
Several months later, she reemerged

193
00:14:13,937 --> 00:14:17,441
as part of a small but vocal opposition
to the Krill establishment.

194
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,670
It didn't really gain traction
until the Krill started talking

195
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:22,005
about a treaty with the Union.

196
00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:24,549
That's when Teleya's rhetoric
started to resonate.

197
00:14:24,573 --> 00:14:27,051
More and more people
began to take her seriously.

198
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:28,720
Her personal story,

199
00:14:28,744 --> 00:14:31,556
the so-called massacre
of her brother and crew,

200
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:34,809
helped her reinvent herself
as a sort of folk hero.

201
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:36,561
She's been gaining popularity ever since.

202
00:14:36,585 --> 00:14:38,396
- Does she have a chance in the election?

203
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,565
- It's our understanding
that Chancellor Korin

204
00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:41,774
maintains a wide lead.

205
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:44,652
But for some, his embrace
of the treaty makes him look soft.

206
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:46,404
To the more radical demographics,

207
00:14:46,428 --> 00:14:50,200
his comparatively moderate administration
seems out of touch.

208
00:14:50,224 --> 00:14:53,328
So what you've got
is a political vacuum.

209
00:14:53,352 --> 00:14:56,706
- A political vacuum is a dangerous thing.
- Always.

210
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:59,501
If no one fills it with hope,
someone will fill it with fear.

211
00:14:59,525 --> 00:15:02,128
Regardless of the outcome,
we have to assume Teleya

212
00:15:02,152 --> 00:15:05,131
will do everything in her power
to undermine the alliance.

213
00:15:05,155 --> 00:15:07,342
- I thought we'd made progress...

214
00:15:07,366 --> 00:15:09,868
- Ed, you know her better than any of us.

215
00:15:10,619 --> 00:15:13,556
If there are any insights
you could provide as far as her thinking,

216
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:17,167
her vulnerabilities,
it would be very helpful.

217
00:15:26,385 --> 00:15:31,241
- I promise you, you will achieve
nothing by this demonstration.

218
00:15:33,725 --> 00:15:37,914
There will be no additional funding
for the Uvok Province!

219
00:15:41,024 --> 00:15:42,192
- Come in.

220
00:15:45,654 --> 00:15:47,656
Hey.
- Hey.

221
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:51,410
I was just checking to see
how you're holding up.

222
00:15:52,578 --> 00:15:54,830
- I owe you an apology.

223
00:15:55,414 --> 00:15:56,498
- For what?

224
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:02,546
- You objected to my releasing Teleya,
and I ignored you.

225
00:16:05,883 --> 00:16:07,134
I just...

226
00:16:07,843 --> 00:16:11,573
wanted to believe that I had
reached her on some level.

227
00:16:11,597 --> 00:16:14,183
- You can't blame yourself
for what Teleya believes.

228
00:16:17,561 --> 00:16:18,520
- Look at this.

229
00:16:21,857 --> 00:16:26,379
Chancellor Korin gave us limited access
to the Krill informational network.

230
00:16:26,403 --> 00:16:29,465
The people of the Uvok Province

231
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:31,342
have repeatedly shown themselves

232
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:35,972
to be blasphemous degenerates,
unworthy of our aid!

233
00:16:35,996 --> 00:16:38,433
By assembling in this place,

234
00:16:38,457 --> 00:16:43,354
you show yourselves
to be as disloyal as they are!

235
00:16:43,378 --> 00:16:47,692
You will regret what you do here today!

236
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:53,031
- A few minutes after this,
the protestors were gassed with helocine.

237
00:16:53,055 --> 00:16:54,616
Eleven people died.

238
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,159
- My God.

239
00:16:56,183 --> 00:16:57,869
This is the guy
we want to sign a treaty with?

240
00:16:57,893 --> 00:17:00,747
- You know what the real problem
with this event is?

241
00:17:00,771 --> 00:17:02,189
It never happened.

242
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,442
It's completely fictitious.

243
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:09,589
And there are countless other files
that show all kinds of scenarios

244
00:17:09,613 --> 00:17:12,133
where Chancellor Korin
oppresses his people.

245
00:17:12,157 --> 00:17:15,220
There are even some from the other side
designed to discredit Teleya,

246
00:17:15,244 --> 00:17:17,764
although they're not that different
from her actual speeches.

247
00:17:17,788 --> 00:17:19,265
- How can you tell the difference?

248
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:20,874
- Sometimes I can't.

249
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:25,146
I asked the Chancellor, and he said
they call it "influence operations."

250
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:26,773
They have computers

251
00:17:26,797 --> 00:17:31,069
generating thousands of these things
every second, trying to stoke outrage.

252
00:17:31,093 --> 00:17:32,987
Even the angry crowds are phony.

253
00:17:33,011 --> 00:17:35,740
- What do you make of it?
As far as the election goes?

254
00:17:35,764 --> 00:17:37,182
- I don't know.

255
00:17:38,392 --> 00:17:41,079
Teleya is inexperienced.

256
00:17:41,103 --> 00:17:43,814
She's a populist, not a politician.

257
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:46,292
She's running on rhetoric and fire.

258
00:17:46,316 --> 00:17:49,462
So the Chancellor
thinks that he's still a lock.

259
00:17:49,486 --> 00:17:52,489
He says he trusts
his people to follow the will of Avis.

260
00:17:54,408 --> 00:17:56,952
- You never want to underestimate
a populist movement.

261
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:00,289
Emotions can be
more persuasive than thoughts.

262
00:18:02,499 --> 00:18:04,501
You think any of this will
affect the treaty?

263
00:18:05,127 --> 00:18:08,380
- Battle plans are only perfect
until the fighting starts.

264
00:18:09,214 --> 00:18:14,178
I gotta believe that some version of that
holds true for peace treaties.

00:23:30,536 --> 00:23:33,097
- President Alcuzan. Welcome.

317
00:23:33,121 --> 00:23:36,017
This is truly an historic occasion.

318
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:38,561
- Your gracious invitation honors us,
Chancellor.

319
00:23:38,585 --> 00:23:42,398
- Please, join us for some Kahspid cider.

320
00:23:42,422 --> 00:23:43,733
A Krill delicacy.

321
00:23:43,757 --> 00:23:45,151
- Alien delicacies.

322
00:23:45,175 --> 00:23:46,718
- Always a crap shoot.

323
00:23:49,888 --> 00:23:52,158
- Wow!
- Mm. That's fantastic.

324
00:23:52,182 --> 00:23:53,993
- My God, could we get a case of this?

325
00:23:54,017 --> 00:23:57,664
- We take great pride
in our Kahspid crops.

326
00:23:57,688 --> 00:23:59,749
I will have some sent to your ship.

327
00:23:59,773 --> 00:24:01,251
Your timing is excellent.

328
00:24:01,275 --> 00:24:05,713
Several districts have yet to be counted,
but we remain confident.

329
00:24:05,737 --> 00:24:09,342
Tonight, we will all have reason
to celebrate.

330
00:24:09,366 --> 00:24:10,701
Come, please.

331
00:24:15,122 --> 00:24:17,517
- What is your opinion
of our city, Ensign?

332
00:24:17,541 --> 00:24:19,018
- It's amazing.

333
00:24:19,042 --> 00:24:21,104
The view was incredible from the shuttle.

334
00:24:21,128 --> 00:24:23,213
I hope we get to see more of it.

335
00:24:30,971 --> 00:24:33,908
- If I may propose a toast,
Chancellor...

336
00:24:33,932 --> 00:24:35,076
To the treaty.

337
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,619
- And to the future.

338
00:24:42,482 --> 00:24:44,294
- What's that cluster of lights?

339
00:24:44,318 --> 00:24:48,006
- The Grand Marketplace,
our center of commerce.

340
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:51,408
Merchants from every corner of the planet
can be found there.

341
00:24:52,534 --> 00:24:54,804
- Chancellor, I am sorry to interrupt,

342
00:24:54,828 --> 00:24:57,640
but the final districts
are reporting their outcomes.

343
00:24:57,664 --> 00:24:58,933
- And?

344
00:24:58,957 --> 00:25:01,460
- The situation has changed.

345
00:25:09,426 --> 00:25:10,820
- What's going on?

346
00:25:10,844 --> 00:25:14,139
- Teleya. She has prevailed
in the last seven districts.

347
00:25:14,681 --> 00:25:15,974
- But you're still ahead, right?

348
00:25:21,563 --> 00:25:22,832
- What's happening?

349
00:25:22,856 --> 00:25:25,418
- The final districts
are being counted now.

350
00:25:25,442 --> 00:25:28,820
The Chancellor is winning,
but only by a small margin.

351
00:25:32,783 --> 00:25:34,385
- No.

352
00:25:34,409 --> 00:25:36,095
This is...

353
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:37,222
not possible.

354
00:25:37,246 --> 00:25:39,474
- We have lost the Katal District.

355
00:25:39,498 --> 00:25:41,518
And the Garathon is turning as well.

356
00:25:41,542 --> 00:25:43,561
Chancellor,
we cannot win without them!

357
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:46,731
- Several districts have yet to report,

358
00:25:46,755 --> 00:25:49,400
but they will have no bearing
on the final outcome.

359
00:25:49,424 --> 00:25:52,278
The Circle of Clerics have conferred,

360
00:25:52,302 --> 00:25:58,016
and they are prepared to sanctify Teleya
as the Supreme Chancellor of Krill.

361
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:02,330
When sanctification is ratified,

362
00:26:02,354 --> 00:26:06,042
the anointing ceremony will commence,
and all citizens...

363
00:26:06,066 --> 00:26:08,294
- Notify the Circle of Clerics

364
00:26:08,318 --> 00:26:11,464
that they must suspend
their judgment immediately.

365
00:26:11,488 --> 00:26:13,550
We intend to challenge this result.

366
00:26:13,574 --> 00:26:15,385
- They are unlikely to reconsider.

367
00:26:15,409 --> 00:26:21,373
- They will do as I say
as long as I am still Supreme Chancellor.

368
00:26:23,375 --> 00:26:25,854
Clearly, our projections were flawed.

369
00:26:25,878 --> 00:26:28,523
But close elections
are not unprecedented.

370
00:26:28,547 --> 00:26:33,153
When the margin of victory is this narrow,
a challenge is always honored.

371
00:26:33,177 --> 00:26:34,803
And I am certain that once...

372
00:26:36,972 --> 00:26:37,973
- Korin!

373
00:26:39,016 --> 00:26:40,660
You will come with us.

374
00:26:40,684 --> 00:26:42,704
- What is the meaning of this?!

375
00:26:42,728 --> 00:26:44,622
- We have orders for your arrest.

376
00:26:44,646 --> 00:26:47,000
- Arrest? For what?

377
00:26:47,024 --> 00:26:48,251
- Treason.

378
00:26:48,275 --> 00:26:50,044
- Whose orders?

379
00:26:50,068 --> 00:26:52,112
- Supreme Chancellor Teleya.

380
00:26:52,821 --> 00:26:55,449
You will come with us. Now.

381
00:26:56,325 --> 00:26:58,845
- This is heresy!
Teleya has not sworn her oath!

382
00:26:58,869 --> 00:27:02,348
She has no authority!
I am Supreme Chancellor!

383
00:27:02,372 --> 00:27:04,893
This is not an election, it is a coup!

384
00:27:04,917 --> 00:27:06,936
Pakor, contact the Circle of Clerics!

385
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,814
- Our fate belongs to Avis now.

386
00:27:09,838 --> 00:27:12,942
- Let me go, you fools!
- The people have...

387
00:27:12,966 --> 00:27:16,637
- We are observers here.
You have no right to detain us.

388
00:27:17,179 --> 00:27:19,032
- Mr. President!
- Are you all right?

389
00:27:19,056 --> 00:27:20,116
- Help him!

390
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,266
- Take them.

391
00:27:34,696 --> 00:27:39,034
- Commander. One of the Krill vessels
is locking onto us with a tractor beam.

392
00:27:42,913 --> 00:27:45,099
- Hail them.
- They're already hailing us.

393
00:27:45,123 --> 00:27:46,124
- Put them through.

394
00:27:47,167 --> 00:27:49,771
This is Commander Kelly Grayson.
What the hell are you doing?

395
00:27:49,795 --> 00:27:51,940
- The treaty has been nullified.

396
00:27:51,964 --> 00:27:54,943
Supreme Chancellor Teleya
has called for your imprisonment.

397
00:27:54,967 --> 00:27:56,277
- I'm sorry, what?

398
00:27:56,301 --> 00:27:58,822
- Surrender your vessel
and prepare to be boarded.

399
00:27:58,846 --> 00:28:00,615
- Contact the landing party.

400
00:28:00,639 --> 00:28:02,116
- I'm trying. No response.

401
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:04,118
- I demand to speak with Captain Mercer.

402
00:28:04,142 --> 00:28:07,312
- Surrender now.
You will not be warned again.

403
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:10,232
- Any word?
- Nothing.

404
00:28:11,191 --> 00:28:13,586
- Bortus, I want you
to lock onto their tractor emitters.

405
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:16,405
Stand by to fire on my command.
- Aye, sir.

406
00:28:16,905 --> 00:28:19,175
- Bridge to Engineering.
- Lamarr here.

407
00:28:19,199 --> 00:28:22,220
John, execute Directive 21.

408
00:28:22,244 --> 00:28:24,848
- Sir, please confirm. Did you say 21?

409
00:28:24,872 --> 00:28:26,391
Yes. Have Dr. Finn assist you.

410
00:28:26,415 --> 00:28:27,475
Do it now.

411
00:28:27,499 --> 00:28:28,917
- Understood.

412
00:28:30,752 --> 00:28:31,837
- Go to red alert.

413
00:28:33,046 --> 00:28:35,775
- Targeting scanners are locked.
Weapons standing by.

414
00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:37,527
- Gordon, get ready to haul ass.

415
00:28:37,551 --> 00:28:38,486
- You got it.

416
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:40,613
They have activated their docking clamps.

417
00:28:40,637 --> 00:28:42,031
- Fire.

418
00:28:44,516 --> 00:28:46,286
- We're clear!
- Evasive maneuvers!

419
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:47,561
Full power to the deflectors!

420
00:28:52,316 --> 00:28:53,775
Hard about, return fire!

421
00:29:06,997 --> 00:29:09,934
- Port deflectors are failing!
Torpedo launchers are off-line!

422
00:29:09,958 --> 00:29:11,394
- John, what's your status?

423
00:29:11,418 --> 00:29:13,045
Almost ready, Commander!

424
00:29:14,129 --> 00:29:16,024
- How close is "almost"?
- Two minutes!

425
00:29:16,048 --> 00:29:17,674
- I can't shake 'em!

426
00:29:21,386 --> 00:29:23,948
Sir, what if we tried
an expanding helix maneuver?

427
00:29:23,972 --> 00:29:26,242
- Never heard of it.
- That's because I just made it up.

428
00:29:26,266 --> 00:29:28,769
Do it.

429
00:29:40,948 --> 00:29:42,407
- Krill fighters in pursuit.

430
00:29:50,165 --> 00:29:52,435
- John, we're about to lose deflectors.
It's now or never.

431
00:29:52,459 --> 00:29:55,629
- Directive 21 clear, Commander.
- Gordon, take us to quantum.

432
00:30:15,899 --> 00:30:18,711
- Hail Avis!
- Hail Teleya!

433
00:30:31,331 --> 00:30:35,228
- The Anhkana teaches us
that a battle is not won

434
00:30:35,252 --> 00:30:38,231
until the last enemy is vanquished.

435
00:30:38,255 --> 00:30:41,550
We have achieved a great victory today,

436
00:30:42,593 --> 00:30:45,446
but an enemy remains in our midst.

437
00:30:55,731 --> 00:30:58,775
Look into the eyes
of the people you have betrayed!

438
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:07,534
You are a traitor to your world
and a heretic in the eyes of Avis.

439
00:31:09,077 --> 00:31:11,705
Do you wish to beg for mercy?

440
00:31:22,341 --> 00:31:25,361
- Then it is my duty as Supreme Chancellor

441
00:31:25,385 --> 00:31:28,490
to see that justice is done.

442
00:31:53,872 --> 00:31:56,542
- He is not the last of our enemies.

443
00:31:57,167 --> 00:32:00,230
I have learned that
the President of the Planetary Union

444
00:32:00,254 --> 00:32:02,941
and his delegation have been apprehended.

445
00:32:02,965 --> 00:32:06,736
They too shall face justice!

446
00:32:18,522 --> 00:32:21,251
- We need to speak
with Chancellor Teleya.

447
00:32:21,275 --> 00:32:23,169
Or whoever the hell is in charge.

448
00:32:23,193 --> 00:32:26,047
You can't just hold us here indefinitely.

449
00:32:26,071 --> 00:32:28,699
At least let us contact The Orville.

450
00:32:29,575 --> 00:32:32,720
You've got the President
of the Planetary Union in here.

451
00:32:32,744 --> 00:32:35,664
Do you want to be held responsible
for starting a war?

452
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:37,833
- How about a cup of coffee?

453
00:32:38,542 --> 00:32:41,646
- Commander Grayson must be aware
of our situation by now.

454
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:42,981
She'll contact the Union.

455
00:32:43,005 --> 00:32:45,174
- Assuming The Orville
hasn't been captured.

456
00:32:46,258 --> 00:32:48,903
- I'm sorry, Ensign,
we never should've brought you along.

457
00:32:48,927 --> 00:32:51,990
- Captain, there's no way this doesn't
mean a declaration of war with the Krill.

458
00:32:52,014 --> 00:32:53,158
Right?

459
00:32:53,182 --> 00:32:55,702
- They've abducted the President.
There's your answer.

460
00:32:55,726 --> 00:32:57,996
- If there's a drawn-out conflict,
it'll weaken our resources.

461
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:00,647
We can bet the Kaylon will seize
the opportunity to attack.

462
00:33:01,148 --> 00:33:02,584
What then?

463
00:33:02,608 --> 00:33:05,110
- We'll find ourselves fighting
a two-front war.

464
00:33:06,195 --> 00:33:07,380
Of course, so will the Krill.

465
00:33:07,404 --> 00:33:10,675
- We need each other,
whether they understand it or not.

466
00:33:10,699 --> 00:33:12,117
We have to get them to see that.

467
00:33:12,868 --> 00:33:14,161
- It's too late.

468
00:33:18,457 --> 00:33:19,541
- Captain Mercer.

469
00:33:22,085 --> 00:33:23,396
You will come with us.

470
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:24,772
- What about them?

471
00:33:24,796 --> 00:33:26,048
- Just you.

472
00:33:27,633 --> 00:33:30,093
- Go with them.
We can't do anything from in here.

473
00:34:07,548 --> 00:34:08,632
- You may go.

474
00:34:18,475 --> 00:34:19,893
So silent.

475
00:34:20,853 --> 00:34:22,914
Nothing to say, Captain?

476
00:34:22,938 --> 00:34:25,524
- Looks like you're an uptown girl now.

477
00:34:27,192 --> 00:34:28,527
Billy Joel.

478
00:34:34,366 --> 00:34:35,718
I guess...

479
00:34:35,742 --> 00:34:37,744
congratulations are in order.

480
00:34:38,328 --> 00:34:39,454
- Thank you.

481
00:34:40,998 --> 00:34:43,476
- Captivity notwithstanding...

482
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,979
it's nice to see your face.

483
00:34:46,003 --> 00:34:48,106
- You should feel validated.

484
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:51,025
Your faith in me
has made this victory possible.

485
00:34:51,049 --> 00:34:52,443
- How so?

486
00:34:52,467 --> 00:34:56,698
- If you had not released me,
I would still be in Union custody.

487
00:34:56,722 --> 00:35:01,286
- I let you go because I believed
we'd found some common ground,

488
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:04,122
not so you could drive a deeper wedge
between our two peoples.

489
00:35:04,146 --> 00:35:06,315
- There was never a common ground.

490
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:10,295
You were merely too stupid
to resist a false seduction.

491
00:35:10,319 --> 00:35:13,780
- Well, movie night was fun,
but that's not what I'm talking about.

492
00:35:14,531 --> 00:35:18,219
Teleya, we share a common enemy.

493
00:35:18,243 --> 00:35:20,013
And my ensign is right:

494
00:35:20,037 --> 00:35:22,599
if the Kaylon attack us again,
we're gonna need each other.

495
00:35:22,623 --> 00:35:26,936
- Our military has developed
new and more powerful weapons.

496
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,254
Our fleet is stronger than ever before.

497
00:35:30,589 --> 00:35:33,568
An alliance with outsiders
is no longer necessary.

498
00:35:33,592 --> 00:35:37,113
- About half your population disagrees.
Korin had a lot of support.

499
00:35:37,137 --> 00:35:39,848
- Korin's influence
has diminished considerably.

500
00:35:40,432 --> 00:35:42,202
Ask him yourself if you would like.

501
00:35:42,226 --> 00:35:45,330
You will find him
in the center of the Capitol Square.

502
00:35:45,354 --> 00:35:47,397
Or at least his head.

503
00:35:48,524 --> 00:35:49,751
- You killed him.

504
00:35:49,775 --> 00:35:53,087
- Most men who lose their heads
tend to die, yes.

505
00:35:53,111 --> 00:35:54,780
- How could you do that?

506
00:35:55,781 --> 00:35:57,258
Teleya, that's not who you are.

507
00:35:57,282 --> 00:36:00,762
- A year later, you still cling
to an illusion I created.

508
00:36:00,786 --> 00:36:03,330
Captain, you really must
find yourself a...

509
00:36:04,206 --> 00:36:06,017
what is your word for it?

510
00:36:06,041 --> 00:36:07,101
A girlfriend.

511
00:36:07,125 --> 00:36:10,688
- You murdered a man.
- I purified the soul of our world.

512
00:36:10,712 --> 00:36:12,923
- Well, if that's the way you see it...

513
00:36:14,299 --> 00:36:15,801
then I guess you're right.

514
00:36:16,468 --> 00:36:17,779
I was too stupid.

515
00:36:17,803 --> 00:36:21,032
- Praise Avis,
his eyes are finally open.

516
00:36:21,056 --> 00:36:22,724
- So, is that why you brought me here?

517
00:36:24,059 --> 00:36:26,812
To remind me what an idiot I was?

518
00:36:27,396 --> 00:36:29,857
- I brought you here to see for myself.

519
00:36:31,024 --> 00:36:32,502
To be sure it was really you.

520
00:36:32,526 --> 00:36:33,569
- Why?

521
00:36:34,736 --> 00:36:37,990
- I promised my people
the blood of the Union contingent.

522
00:36:40,367 --> 00:36:41,678
- What are you saying?

523
00:36:41,702 --> 00:36:44,746
- You and your colleagues
are to be executed in the morning.

524
00:36:46,081 --> 00:36:47,958
- So you want me dead too?

525
00:36:48,917 --> 00:36:51,170
- I did not know you were part
of the delegation.

526
00:36:52,004 --> 00:36:55,358
- Teleya. I let you go.

527
00:36:55,382 --> 00:36:58,278
I'm asking you to do the same for us.

528
00:36:58,302 --> 00:36:59,404
Now, you may not want a treaty,

529
00:36:59,428 --> 00:37:01,513
but do you really want to start
a war with the Union?

530
00:37:04,433 --> 00:37:07,245
- Take a look around you, Captain.

531
00:37:07,269 --> 00:37:09,521
I now command the full might of Krill.

532
00:37:10,147 --> 00:37:13,376
It is you who should be asking yourself,

533
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,986
is the Union prepared for war with us?

534
00:37:18,822 --> 00:37:23,928
- There's an old Earth verse
that describes a traveler

535
00:37:23,952 --> 00:37:27,390
who comes upon the ancient ruined statue
of an Emperor,

536
00:37:27,414 --> 00:37:32,312
inscribed with the words,
"My name is Ozymandias, king of kings.

537
00:37:32,336 --> 00:37:35,714
Look upon my works, ye mighty,
and despair!"

538
00:37:37,508 --> 00:37:41,678
Only there's nothing left beside it
except empty desert.

539
00:37:43,388 --> 00:37:46,308
Hubris has a way of coming back
to bite you in the ass.

540
00:37:46,892 --> 00:37:51,855
- Our time in this realm is finite,
Captain, as you will soon learn.

541
00:37:52,564 --> 00:37:57,778
One can live it in the light of command
or in the darkness of servitude.

542
00:37:59,071 --> 00:38:01,740
I choose the way of Ozymandias.

543

Cha-FAJ!

Take him back to his cell.

545

The execution will proceed as planned.

546
00:38:10,999 --> 00:38:12,793

- Goodbye, Ed.

prisoners charged with conspiracy

That your feelings for Ed

00:45:10,294 --> 00:45:11,813

636
00:45:11,837 --> 00:45:13,565

637

It is best that way.

638
00:45:18,802 --> 00:45:20,012
- Can I talk to her?

639
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:31,648
Hi there.

640
00:45:32,274 --> 00:45:33,567
- Hello.

641
00:45:34,735 --> 00:45:35,920
- What's your name?

642
00:45:35,944 --> 00:45:37,505
- Anaya.

643
00:45:37,529 --> 00:45:39,007
- That's a pretty name.

644
00:45:39,031 --> 00:45:40,258
- What's yours?

645
00:45:40,282 --> 00:45:41,843
- I'm Ed.

646
00:45:41,867 --> 00:45:43,720
- That's a funny name.

647
00:45:43,744 --> 00:45:45,162
You look funny.

648
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:47,831
- Thanks. I get that a lot.

649
00:45:50,834 --> 00:45:52,395
You have a nice house.

650
00:45:52,419 --> 00:45:54,171
- Thank you.

651
00:45:55,214 --> 00:45:57,382
- Do you like it here?
- Yes.

652
00:45:58,133 --> 00:45:59,777
- Do they take good care of you?

653
00:45:59,801 --> 00:46:01,404
- I have my own room.

654
00:46:01,428 --> 00:46:05,158
I have lots of toys
and I get to eat whatever I want.

655
00:46:05,182 --> 00:46:06,767
- Sounds pretty good.

656
00:46:10,854 --> 00:46:12,248
I don't know how.

657
00:46:12,272 --> 00:46:14,316
- It's easy. I'll show you.

658
00:46:20,864 --> 00:46:22,091
- Wow.

659
00:46:22,115 --> 00:46:23,885
You know, you're really smart.

660
00:46:23,909 --> 00:46:25,869
- She is quite extraordinary.

661
00:46:27,412 --> 00:46:28,872
- Yeah.

662
00:46:29,581 --> 00:46:30,725
Yeah, she is.

663
00:46:30,749 --> 00:46:32,209
- Do you feel shame?

664
00:46:33,377 --> 00:46:37,607
- No. No, why would I?

665
00:46:37,631 --> 00:46:40,568
- Some would look at Anaya
and see an abomination.

666
00:46:40,592 --> 00:46:43,321
I see a beautiful child.

667
00:46:43,345 --> 00:46:46,682
And something much more: hope.

668
00:46:47,307 --> 00:46:49,786
- We are part of a coalition that believes

669
00:46:49,810 --> 00:46:52,580
that a treaty with the Union
is still possible.

670
00:46:52,604 --> 00:46:53,957
Given the outcome of the election,

671
00:46:53,981 --> 00:46:56,376
it would take a miracle
to make it happen now.

672
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,235
- Anaya could be that miracle.

673
00:46:59,194 --> 00:47:00,213
- What do you mean?

674
00:47:00,237 --> 00:47:03,633
- You must show the child to all of Krill.

675
00:47:03,657 --> 00:47:07,369
Her mother will no longer
be able to deny her existence.

676
00:47:08,829 --> 00:47:10,557
- You want me to...

677
00:47:10,581 --> 00:47:14,310
embarrass Teleya in order to bring down
her government, is that it?

678
00:47:14,334 --> 00:47:16,771
- No. That would accomplish nothing.

679
00:47:16,795 --> 00:47:19,315
Someone else like her
would eventually take her place.

680
00:47:19,339 --> 00:47:22,402
There is always another Teleya.

681
00:47:22,426 --> 00:47:27,973
- You must persuade her to stand up
with you and acknowledge the child.

682
00:47:28,682 --> 00:47:31,411
Some of her supporters
will feel betrayed,

683
00:47:31,435 --> 00:47:36,040
but others may reconsider
their hostility toward the Union.

684
00:47:36,064 --> 00:47:40,837
Anaya could become
a powerful symbol of coexistence.

685
00:47:40,861 --> 00:47:43,822
She might turn the tide toward peace.

686
00:47:46,742 --> 00:47:51,181
- First off, Teleya and I are not exactly
on the best of terms right now.

687
00:47:51,205 --> 00:47:53,790
- Did you know she decided
to let you live?

688
00:47:55,042 --> 00:47:57,562
- What?
- That is why she released you.

689
00:47:57,586 --> 00:48:00,607
We have an informant
in her security detail.

690
00:48:00,631 --> 00:48:03,776
The guards had orders
to take you back to your ship.

691
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:07,262
- Evidently, Captain,
she still cares about you.

692
00:48:12,935 --> 00:48:15,229
- I'm gonna need a ride back
to the capital.

693
00:48:27,199 --> 00:48:28,867
Goodbye, Anaya.

694
00:48:29,743 --> 00:48:31,870
It was very nice to meet you.

I was simply repaying the debt.

729
00:50:43,877 --> 00:50:48,090

We should be celebrating her.

We should be standing with her,
side by side...

734

that we can all coexist.
- No.

- She is living proof of that.
- No.

737

- No, no, no!

- Then what did you have her for?

739

What did you have her for,

740
00:51:12,990 --> 00:51:15,301
if you were just gonna keep her
locked away like some kind of criminal?

- Oh!

742
00:51:16,410 --> 00:51:19,597
How human of you to ask that question.

743
00:51:19,621 --> 00:51:22,934
But then you terminate life with abandon,
do you not?

- Parents to a child who will never be.

750
00:52:05,751 --> 00:52:08,771
They were caught after
terminating a life in the womb.

00:56:40,526 --> 00:56:41,860
Claire!

798
00:56:42,444 --> 00:56:43,922
- Microdermal makeover.

799
00:56:43,946 --> 00:56:46,591
Trust me, Mr. President,
I'm much better-looking in person.

800
00:56:46,615 --> 00:56:48,593
- You're a welcome sight to me, Doctor.

801
00:56:48,617 --> 00:56:50,720
- Everybody hang on,
we're not out of this yet.

802
00:56:50,744 --> 00:56:52,829
♪

803
00:57:16,019 --> 00:57:17,163
- Isaac, anything?

804
00:57:17,187 --> 00:57:19,707
Commander Lamarr
has activated his transponder.

805
00:57:19,731 --> 00:57:21,567
They are moving away from the capital.

806
00:57:40,627 --> 00:57:43,672
- Where's your shuttle?
- Bearing 3-7-5 mark one.

807
00:57:48,218 --> 00:57:50,113
Uh-oh.

808
00:57:50,137 --> 00:57:52,514
- What's wrong?
- The nav system just went out.

809
00:58:02,065 --> 00:58:04,294
- You do know where you're going, right?

810
00:58:04,318 --> 00:58:06,796
- I mean, this kind of looks familiar.
- Oh, boy.

811
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:08,381
- It's okay,
we got a navigator right here.

812
00:58:08,405 --> 00:58:09,382
Help me out, Charly.

813
00:58:09,406 --> 00:58:11,134
- There! Make a right!
- You sure?

814
00:58:11,158 --> 00:58:12,201
- Nope.

815
00:58:20,792 --> 00:58:22,353
- Ow!
- Easy, John!

816
00:58:22,377 --> 00:58:23,253
- Sorry!

817
00:58:47,736 --> 00:58:49,571
Okay. Okay, yeah, that's it.

818
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:23,021
- Commander, I am tracking the shuttle,
400 kilometers and closing.

819
00:59:31,029 --> 00:59:32,364
- Well, that doesn't look good.

820
00:59:44,168 --> 00:59:46,312
The shuttle
has sustained heavy damage.

821
00:59:46,336 --> 00:59:49,464
- What's their position?
- Bearing 121 mark six.

822
00:59:51,258 --> 00:59:53,427
- Lay down fire
and get us into docking range.

823
01:00:04,438 --> 01:00:06,148
Open the bay doors.

824
01:00:17,159 --> 01:00:18,452
- They're secure!

825
01:00:20,078 --> 01:00:22,056
- Grayson to Ozawa.
We have the delegation.

826
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:23,516
I suggest we get the hell outta here.

827
01:00:23,540 --> 01:00:24,642
Acknowledged.

828
01:00:24,666 --> 01:00:27,103
Ozawa to all ships: disengage and retreat.

829
01:00:27,127 --> 01:00:29,338
- Set a course for Earth.
- Aye, sir!

830
01:00:56,490 --> 01:00:58,801
- I'm pleased to report
that President Alcuzan

831
01:00:58,825 --> 01:01:00,136
is going to make a full recovery.

832
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:02,931
He plans to address
the Union Council later today.

833
01:01:02,955 --> 01:01:05,642
- It was all looking
so hopeful just a few days ago.

834
01:01:05,666 --> 01:01:09,336
- There is... one card left to play.
If we want to.

835
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:12,982
- Anaya.

836
01:01:13,006 --> 01:01:15,985
- Revealing her could force Teleya's hand.

837
01:01:16,009 --> 01:01:17,195
- Admiral...

838
01:01:17,219 --> 01:01:20,764
she didn't ask to be
born into the eye of a storm.

839
01:01:21,348 --> 01:01:24,953
And I gotta be honest, I'm not so sure
Teleya wouldn't make her disappear

840
01:01:24,977 --> 01:01:26,412
just to protect the regime.

841
01:01:26,436 --> 01:01:28,832
- You really think
she'd be capable of that?

842
01:01:28,856 --> 01:01:30,065
- I thought I knew her.

843
01:01:30,899 --> 01:01:31,859
I don't.

844
01:01:32,526 --> 01:01:33,735
- She's your daughter.

845
01:01:34,361 --> 01:01:36,446
The President is leaving it up to you.

846
01:01:37,656 --> 01:01:38,991
- Tell him thank you.

847
01:01:52,504 --> 01:01:56,675
It's very possible
that I'll never see her again.

848
01:01:58,135 --> 01:02:00,095
- Well, that'd be a shame.

849
01:02:01,180 --> 01:02:03,265
I always thought you'd make
a terrific father.

850
01:02:03,974 --> 01:02:05,058
I'm...

851
01:02:05,934 --> 01:02:07,895
sad we never got that far.

852
01:02:09,479 --> 01:02:10,689
- Me too.

853
01:02:13,108 --> 01:02:15,420
- It's almost like yesterday was one life

854
01:02:15,444 --> 01:02:16,904
and today is another.

855
01:02:18,197 --> 01:02:20,824
And everything's different
on this side of time.

856
01:02:21,408 --> 01:02:23,285
- Yeah, it is.

857
01:02:25,370 --> 01:02:29,041
- At least you know she's in a safe place
and well cared for.

858
01:02:31,043 --> 01:02:32,419
- I miss her.

859
01:02:33,795 --> 01:02:35,464
Is that weird to say?

860
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:39,110
I only met her once.

861
01:02:39,134 --> 01:02:40,677
I don't even know her.

862
01:02:41,595 --> 01:02:42,638
And I miss her.

863
01:02:46,558 --> 01:02:48,018
The treaty is dead.

864
01:02:49,269 --> 01:02:53,190
But we have to find a way
to preserve some kind of peace.

865
01:02:55,150 --> 01:02:56,318
For Anaya.

866
01:03:03,992 --> 01:03:05,327
- You wanna have breakfast with me?
