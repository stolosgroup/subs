1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Who are the real-world Illuminati ?
Find out @ saveanilluminati.com

2
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:30,808
They've finished scanning
the fifth chamber, sir.

3
00:00:30,893 --> 00:00:32,365
Requesting permission to proceed.

4
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:33,464
Nothing yet, huh?

5
00:00:33,549 --> 00:00:36,231
Not even a stick figure.
Just a whole lotta empty walls.

6
00:00:36,315 --> 00:00:37,636
Charly's mapping it all, but...

7
00:00:37,721 --> 00:00:39,030
Buried treasure would be more fun.

8
00:00:39,114 --> 00:00:40,198
Pretty much.

9
00:00:40,283 --> 00:00:42,375
Well, tell them
they're good to keep moving.

10
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:43,459
Will do.

11
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:51,634
- What are you doing?
- Hm?

12
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:54,637
I see you walking around all the time
with that data pad lately.

13
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:55,805
You writing a novel?

14
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,932
No, uh...

15
00:00:58,016 --> 00:00:59,560
it's for Anaya.

16
00:01:00,102 --> 00:01:01,102
Anaya?

17
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,605
I've been writing letters to her.

18
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:06,275
To Krill?
How the hell are you getting through?

19
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:09,110
Well, I don't actually send them.

20
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:10,820
I just figure that...

21
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:15,075
someday, if I do see her again,
they might be something she'd wanna read.

22
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:17,160
Since I'm missing her life now,

23
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:21,123
she can go back in time
and feel like I was there.

24
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,082
You know...

25
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:27,337
after all these years,
you're still able to surprise me.

26
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:29,464
Commander!

27
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:32,718
We've found something!

28
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:46,564
You've mapped all this, right?
I'd hate to get lost.

29
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:49,109
Just follow the bread crumbs,
you'll be fine, sir.

30
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:58,535
Lieutenant, what have you got?

31
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:01,621
Captain. We have detected
a large chamber beyond this wall.

32
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:04,833
Based on Ensign Burke's
cartographic index of the chambers

33
00:02:04,917 --> 00:02:06,376
we have discovered thus far,

34
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:09,254
it is possible we have found
the primary burial vault.

35
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:10,296
Can we get inside?

36
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,841
Hemblicite tombs
are notorious for booby traps.

37
00:02:12,925 --> 00:02:14,717
According to our scans,
this thing is rigged

38
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,094
to kill anyone who tries to open it.

39
00:02:16,178 --> 00:02:17,888
Well, so how do we breach it?

40
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:22,643
I would suggest you step back
against the far wall.

41
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,874
It is now safe to proceed.

42
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,295
You, uh, got
a little something right there.

43
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:15,404
Jackpot.

44
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:43,848
Scan is complete.
Uploading data for carbon analysis.

45
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:45,100
Acknowledged.

46
00:03:45,184 --> 00:03:46,518
How old is this stuff?

47
00:03:46,602 --> 00:03:49,729
The oldest artifacts date back
around 70,000 years.

48
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:52,273
My God. When did they die out?

49
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:55,068
The Hemblicite Empire
fell about 50,000 years ago.

50
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:57,779
They were kinda similar
to the ancient Egyptians.

51
00:03:57,863 --> 00:04:00,990
They used to bury their kings
with all kinds of tools and jewelry

52
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,784
and things that they could use
in the afterlife.

53
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:03,827
Lucky for us.

54
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:07,455
Man, you said archaeology was a hobby.
You sound like an expert.

55
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:08,748
It's interesting stuff.

56
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,667
I don't do anything half-assed,
Lieutenant.

57
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:12,502
I can see that. What's this thing?

58
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:13,962
It's called a jiktal.

59
00:04:14,046 --> 00:04:15,880
It's a razor for facial grooming.

60
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:18,591
You still have to shave
in the afterlife? That sucks.

61
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:21,052
Well, this is all
undeniably fascinating,

62
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:22,846
but I'm at the end of a 12-hour shift,

63
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,973
so if you're good here,
I'm gonna take off.

64
00:04:25,057 --> 00:04:27,100
No problem,
we'll see you in the morning.

65
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:36,777
Return fire!

66
00:04:39,655 --> 00:04:42,282
Sir, the Kaylon have disabled
our forward targeting scanners!

67
00:04:42,366 --> 00:04:44,576
Implement source redirect
from the navigational array!

68
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,497
Fire all torpedoes!

69
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,501
Evasive maneuvers! Hard to port!

70
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:56,296
Kaylon are countering!

71
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:01,384
Deflectors are gone!

72
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:03,095
Divert power from life support!

73
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:41,008
End simulation.

74
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:44,761
Come in.

75
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:49,516
Commander.
- Topa.

76
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,683
Am I interrupting?

77
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:54,521
No. I have exceeded my allotted time.
I apologize.

78
00:05:54,605 --> 00:05:56,690
It's all good, no big deal.

79
00:05:57,441 --> 00:05:59,067
Were you running the command program?

80
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:01,611
Yes.
Is that not permitted?

81
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,696
No, it's fine,
there are no restrictions.

82
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,533
You just... don't usually see people
your age using it.

83
00:06:06,617 --> 00:06:08,910
I have yet to master its intricacies.

84
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:11,246
Well, it's not easy,
that's the whole point.

85
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:12,539
How far have you gotten?

86
00:06:12,623 --> 00:06:16,167
The Kaylon destroy my ship
seven minutes into the battle every time.

87
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:18,879
Believe it or not,
that's a long time for a beginner.

88
00:06:19,463 --> 00:06:21,006
Is this just for fun?

89
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:23,716
I was thinking

90
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,802
that when I am old enough...

91
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:31,015
Commander, I am interested in taking
the Union Point entrance examination.

92
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:32,392
You are?

93
00:06:32,476 --> 00:06:33,935
Topa, that's great.

94
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:35,311
Have you told Bortus?

95
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,689
Yes. He has given his blessing,

96
00:06:37,773 --> 00:06:39,691
but he has warned me
of the difficulty involved.

97
00:06:39,775 --> 00:06:42,026
It's a mountain to climb for sure,

98
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,487
but the fact that you're
challenging yourself like this

99
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:45,906
shows the right initiative.

100
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:50,952
If you're serious about it
and you want to get an early start,

101
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:52,788
I'd be happy to give you some guidance.

102
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:55,957
That is very kind of you, Commander.

103
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:58,293
How about we find a couple of days
this coming week,

104
00:06:58,377 --> 00:07:01,004
and as long as it's all general clearance,
you can shadow me,

105
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:03,131
get a sense of what service entails.

106
00:07:03,215 --> 00:07:04,466
I would be very grateful.

107
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,509
Okay, we'll set it up.

108
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:08,178
Thank you, Commander.

109
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:20,107
<i>Theme song playing...</i>

110
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:02,835
Come in.

111
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:06,129
Topa. You're early.

112
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:07,797
I apologize, Commander.

113
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:10,926
No, don't apologize, it's fine.
We can get a jump on the day.

114
00:09:11,635 --> 00:09:13,095
Come on, let's go.

115
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:19,726
First up on the schedule: Daily rounds.

116
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:20,977
They can be kind of boring,

117
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:23,271
but a vessel this size
has a lot of moving parts.

118
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:25,398
Someone needs to make sure
that the ship's left hand

119
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:27,108
knows what the right hand is doing.

120
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:30,945
That includes things like
power allocation requests, status updates,

121
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:33,448
and most importantly, basic morale.

122
00:09:33,532 --> 00:09:35,241
They like to know you're paying attention.

123
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:36,534
Good morning, Commander.

124
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:37,744
Good morning, Lieutenant.

125
00:09:37,828 --> 00:09:41,498
Also, with so many different species
working on the same ship,

126
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:43,833
the occasional culture clash
is inevitable,

127
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:48,088
and all those headaches fall
under the purview of the First Officer.

128
00:09:50,716 --> 00:09:52,300
All right, thanks.

129
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:54,052
Commander. Thanks for coming by.

130
00:09:54,136 --> 00:09:57,514
- No problem, Biggins, what's up?
- That.

131
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:03,770
Oh. Yeah.

132
00:10:03,854 --> 00:10:06,106
I've never worked
with a Belkarian officer,

133
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:08,066
but Commander Keyali told us
to be prepared.

134
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:10,026
Well, we wouldn't be the first
to have to navigate it.

135
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,111
Did you talk to him?

136
00:10:11,195 --> 00:10:13,197
He insists he's within his rights.

137
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,871
Hey. Lieutenant Bolobar?

138
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:23,456
Ensign Bolobar, sir.

139
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:24,999
Ensign, right.

140
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:27,544
I couldn't remember
without the, uh... shoulders.

141
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:29,421
Which is a good segue, actually.

142
00:10:29,505 --> 00:10:32,048
I'm gonna have to ask you
to put on a uniform.

143
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:35,301
In the Belkarian faith, to wear clothing
on the first day of the month

144
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:37,846
is considered an affront
to the work of the Spirit Lord.

145
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:40,014
I have explained this
to Lieutenant Biggins.

146
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:41,683
Yeah, I heard.

147
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:44,227
Ensign, you must know a uniform

148
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:46,646
is a basic requirement
for service in the fleet.

149
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:48,648
What about Lieutenant Unk
in engineering?

150
00:10:48,732 --> 00:10:49,858
He does not wear a uniform.

151
00:10:49,942 --> 00:10:51,901
Unk is half the size of a shuttle craft.

152
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:53,069
He'd have to wear a tent.

153
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:56,281
The Union is supposed to respect
all cultural traditions.

154
00:10:56,365 --> 00:10:58,659
True, but that works both ways.

155
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:01,453
Look, I don't want to disrespect
your religion,

156
00:11:01,537 --> 00:11:03,955
but maybe there's a sensible compromise

157
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:06,207
between your faith and Union protocol

158
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,418
that would satisfy everyone involved.

159
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:09,919
What do you suggest?

160
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:11,922
Put some pants on,
and we'll call it a day.

161
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:16,218
Very well, Commander.

162
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:23,975
Hey, Commander, sir. Top of the morning.

163
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:26,060
- Hi, Yaphit.
- Commander, I'm glad you're here.

164
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:29,063
We're gonna need clearance
for an extra 15% power allocation

165
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:32,025
to purge the neutron filters
in the dysonium matrix this afternoon.

166
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:33,234
No problem.

167
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:34,569
By the way, hope you don't mind,

168
00:11:34,653 --> 00:11:36,279
Topa's shadowing me for a couple days.

169
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:38,990
Little pre-prep
for the Union Point entrance exam.

170
00:11:39,074 --> 00:11:40,033
Aw, for real?

171
00:11:40,117 --> 00:11:42,452
Wow, Topa, that's really cool.

172
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:49,626
I believe I would like to do
what Commander Grayson does.

173
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:52,504
I haven't told him
how much day drinking that requires.

174
00:11:52,588 --> 00:11:54,756
Ha, ha! Good one, Commander.

175
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,842
Hey, I just want you to know
we always enjoy your visits down here.

176
00:11:57,926 --> 00:11:59,094
Thanks, Yaphit.

177
00:12:00,846 --> 00:12:04,474
Just for your own education,
that's called ass kissing.

178
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:05,767
"Ass kissing."

179
00:12:05,851 --> 00:12:08,103
Will it be on the entrance exam?

180
00:12:08,187 --> 00:12:09,938
No, it won't be.

181
00:12:11,273 --> 00:12:13,024
I know a lot of this seems pretty dull,

182
00:12:13,108 --> 00:12:16,194
but Union service is
as much about mundane busy work

183
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:17,612
as it is about adventure.

184
00:12:17,696 --> 00:12:19,823
No, it is not dull.

185
00:12:19,907 --> 00:12:21,407
I want to know everything.

186
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:23,034
Yeah, you say that now...

187
00:12:23,118 --> 00:12:25,120
If I can ask, Commander,

188
00:12:25,204 --> 00:12:27,372
why did you choose to join the Fleet?

189
00:12:28,207 --> 00:12:32,085
I was always someone
who was comfortable with responsibility.

190
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:36,339
I was usually the one who volunteered
to watch the younger kids on a field trip,

191
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:38,383
or captain the soccer team.

192
00:12:38,467 --> 00:12:41,553
And I liked the satisfaction

193
00:12:41,637 --> 00:12:44,264
of helping other people succeed
at their jobs.

194
00:12:44,348 --> 00:12:46,391
I knew a command position in the Fleet

195
00:12:46,475 --> 00:12:49,144
would mean a long,
slow climb through a system,

196
00:12:49,228 --> 00:12:51,855
but I also knew it would be worth it.

197
00:12:51,939 --> 00:12:54,358
What about you? Why do you want to join?

198
00:12:57,569 --> 00:13:00,029
Ever since I was a young child,

199
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:02,115
I have always felt...

200
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:04,117
incomplete.

201
00:13:04,952 --> 00:13:09,456
As if the person I am today is a bookmark.

202
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:13,961
A placeholder, until I discover who I am.

203
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:19,633
I have not found the answer at home,
so perhaps it is out among the stars.

204
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:23,595
You've... felt this way for some time?

205
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:25,889
I once heard Dr. Finn say that,

206
00:13:25,973 --> 00:13:28,266
"If you wake up in the middle of the night

207
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:31,895
"and there is nothing
to keep you from falling asleep again,

208
00:13:31,979 --> 00:13:33,939
it means you are happy."

209
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,402
I think that maybe...

210
00:13:39,653 --> 00:13:41,446
I am not happy.

211
00:13:43,073 --> 00:13:44,825
You don't sleep well?

212
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:50,664
I always feel as if...
there is something wrong with me.

213
00:13:51,582 --> 00:13:53,208
But I cannot tell what.

214
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:57,337
Lieutenant Malloy says
many people my age feel this way.

215
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:00,132
Perhaps it is normal.

216
00:14:05,637 --> 00:14:09,390
Lieutenant Felina's doing much better
after the neural regeneration therapy,

217
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:11,851
so I'd say it's safe to put her back
on limited duty.

218
00:14:11,935 --> 00:14:14,562
All right, I'll have Kelly
put her back on the roster.

219
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:16,189
How's Isaac doing?

220
00:14:16,273 --> 00:14:19,067
As far as I can see, remarkably well.

221
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:23,905
Ever since the suicide attempt,
the crew's softened a little toward him.

222
00:14:23,989 --> 00:14:25,615
The power of compassion.

223
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:27,034
Even Charly?

224
00:14:27,618 --> 00:14:29,578
Come in.

225
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:32,247
- Hi, Commander.
- Hey.

226
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:33,998
You guys busy?

227
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:36,334
No, we were just wrapping up.
What's going on?

228
00:14:36,418 --> 00:14:37,627
What's the latest with the dig?

229
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:41,381
Union Central is sending a science team
to take over the excavation.

230
00:14:41,465 --> 00:14:43,091
Aw, just when it was getting good.

231
00:14:43,175 --> 00:14:45,761
Well, they'll be here in a week,
so enjoy it while it lasts.

232
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:49,722
Have either of you...

233
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:52,934
spent any time talking to Topa recently?

234
00:14:53,018 --> 00:14:54,102
I haven't, no.

235
00:14:54,186 --> 00:14:55,312
No. What's up?

236
00:14:56,146 --> 00:14:57,647
I'm worried about him.

237
00:14:57,731 --> 00:14:59,066
What's the matter?

238
00:15:01,443 --> 00:15:05,364
I think that, at some point,
possibly soon...

239
00:15:05,948 --> 00:15:09,618
the person he is and the person he was...

240
00:15:10,244 --> 00:15:12,037
are going to collide with each other.

241
00:15:12,538 --> 00:15:14,080
Has he said something to you?

242
00:15:14,164 --> 00:15:16,332
In a general sense, yes.

243
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:19,461
He's struggling, emotionally.
He's confused.

244
00:15:19,545 --> 00:15:20,671
He knows...

245
00:15:22,631 --> 00:15:25,133
He knows there's
something different about him.

246
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:27,427
Oh, boy.

247
00:15:27,928 --> 00:15:30,305
Why don't you have him
drop by my office?

248
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:31,639
He and I can have a talk,

249
00:15:31,723 --> 00:15:35,393
and it will allow me
to do a casual evaluation.

250
00:15:35,477 --> 00:15:37,521
It might be a little early for that.

251
00:15:38,689 --> 00:15:40,315
He confided in me and it's

252
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,235
possible he could see that
as a breach of trust at this point.

253
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:45,445
I just...

254
00:15:48,115 --> 00:15:49,408
I need guidance.

255
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:54,078
When he tells me this stuff,
I feel like a horrible person.

256
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:56,164
I feel like I'm
lying to him with my silence.

257
00:15:56,248 --> 00:15:58,583
There are times... there are times
I want to scream it out loud,

258
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:00,001
"You were born female.

259
00:16:00,085 --> 00:16:01,961
You were altered without your knowledge."

260
00:16:02,045 --> 00:16:03,380
And then just...

261
00:16:04,923 --> 00:16:07,885
let him decide for himself
how he wants to handle it.

262
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,095
I think

263
00:16:10,179 --> 00:16:12,681
it may be time to talk to Bortus.

264
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:28,780
Yes?

265
00:16:30,574 --> 00:16:32,408
- Hey, guys.
- Commander.

266
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:35,370
Please, sit.
I don't mean to interrupt your dinner.

267
00:16:35,454 --> 00:16:37,747
Have you seen Topa? He is late.

268
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:39,457
I have him helping Ensign Burke

269
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:41,626
with the recalibration
of the navigational array.

270
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:42,836
Part of his exam prep.

271
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,880
We both appreciate the time
you have spent with him.

272
00:16:45,964 --> 00:16:47,382
It's my pleasure.

273
00:16:47,466 --> 00:16:49,176
Please, join us.

274
00:16:53,055 --> 00:16:54,973
Have some Kolp.

275
00:16:55,057 --> 00:16:57,350
- Is that the...
- It is the green one.

276
00:16:57,434 --> 00:16:58,685
Right.

277
00:17:01,271 --> 00:17:03,899
Listen, I have to confess, I had a...

278
00:17:07,736 --> 00:17:10,697
I had an ulterior motive
for putting Topa to work at dinnertime.

279
00:17:11,532 --> 00:17:13,324
There's something I want
to talk to you about.

280
00:17:13,408 --> 00:17:14,408
What is it?

281
00:17:16,203 --> 00:17:18,788
I understand that it's inappropriate
within your culture

282
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:21,124
for me to bring this up, but...

283
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:23,877
have you two ever discussed telling Topa?

284
00:17:23,961 --> 00:17:25,044
About his origins?

285
00:17:25,128 --> 00:17:26,755
You are correct, Commander.

286
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:28,757
It is entirely inappropriate!

287
00:17:28,841 --> 00:17:30,967
How dare you enter our home and...

288
00:17:31,051 --> 00:17:32,469
Klyden!

289
00:17:35,681 --> 00:17:39,267
We have discussed the matter
on several occasions, and we feel...

290
00:17:39,351 --> 00:17:41,811
We do not feel the time is right.

291
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:46,483
And that's your decision, of course,
you're his parents, but

292
00:17:46,567 --> 00:17:50,528
if I can offer
an outsider's perspective,

293
00:17:50,612 --> 00:17:52,822
I think there may be some residual damage

294
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:55,366
that could have had a ripple effect
down through the years.

295
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:56,951
This kid is unhappy.

296
00:17:57,035 --> 00:18:00,038
All children are unhappy.
He will outgrow it.

297
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:04,626
I don't want to betray his confidence
if he hasn't said anything to you,

298
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:06,252
but he thinks there's something
wrong with him.

299
00:18:06,336 --> 00:18:08,755
- What?
- He doesn't know.

300
00:18:10,299 --> 00:18:14,135
Look, everyone at this table is aware
that we're talking about someone

301
00:18:14,219 --> 00:18:16,554
who was surgically altered
without their knowledge or consent...

302
00:18:16,638 --> 00:18:19,390
Commander,
you have overstayed your welcome.

303
00:18:19,474 --> 00:18:20,934
You may go now.

304
00:18:28,233 --> 00:18:30,444
Please. Talk to your son.

305
00:18:31,904 --> 00:18:34,406
I apologize for disturbing your evening.

306
00:18:39,661 --> 00:18:41,079
- Klyden.
- No!

307
00:18:41,163 --> 00:18:42,789
She could be correct.

308
00:18:42,873 --> 00:18:44,290
She is a female!

309
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:47,127
With no understanding of our culture!

310
00:18:47,211 --> 00:18:48,920
If Topa is struggling...

311
00:18:49,004 --> 00:18:53,550
If he is struggling, it is insignificant
compared to the struggle he would face

312
00:18:53,634 --> 00:18:55,511
if he were to learn the truth!

313
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,805
It occurs to me...

314
00:18:59,765 --> 00:19:04,811
that in all the time
we have been together,

315
00:19:04,895 --> 00:19:08,606
I have never once known you
to be uncertain.

316
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:09,858
Of anything.

317
00:19:09,942 --> 00:19:11,568
Tell me,

318
00:19:11,652 --> 00:19:14,070
what is it like to be so wise?

319
00:19:14,154 --> 00:19:15,572
You are mocking me.

320
00:19:15,656 --> 00:19:16,865
You invite it.

321
00:19:16,949 --> 00:19:20,201
Do you know how much pain
I would have been spared

322
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:24,164
had I not discovered
that I was born female?

323
00:19:24,957 --> 00:19:29,670
I would never, ever force our son
to endure such a life!

324
00:19:30,295 --> 00:19:33,298
I love him with all my heart! Do you?

325
00:19:33,382 --> 00:19:34,257
Of course, I do!

326
00:19:34,341 --> 00:19:35,926
Then listen to me!

327
00:19:36,927 --> 00:19:40,930
Bortus, I would give anything

328
00:19:41,014 --> 00:19:43,976
to be ignorant of my beginnings.

329
00:19:44,601 --> 00:19:46,812
Topa may never be happy...

330
00:19:48,063 --> 00:19:51,984
but unhappiness is better than despair.

331
00:20:10,085 --> 00:20:11,295
Come in.

332
00:20:13,338 --> 00:20:16,049
Hey, there you are.
We were scheduled for 1500.

333
00:20:16,133 --> 00:20:18,343
I am sorry, Commander.

334
00:20:18,427 --> 00:20:19,552
Punctuality.

335
00:20:19,636 --> 00:20:22,138
Requirement number one
for a Union officer.

336
00:20:22,222 --> 00:20:23,640
I...

337
00:20:23,724 --> 00:20:25,934
will not be able to continue the training.

338
00:20:26,727 --> 00:20:29,646
- Why not?
- My father has forbidden it.

339
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:33,942
He has told me that if I wish to resume,
I can ask the captain.

340
00:20:34,026 --> 00:20:35,736
But not you.

341
00:20:36,987 --> 00:20:38,322
Topa, I'm...

342
00:20:39,698 --> 00:20:40,782
I'm so sorry.

343
00:20:40,866 --> 00:20:43,785
I have great respect for the captain.

344
00:20:43,869 --> 00:20:45,829
But it is not the same.

345
00:20:46,747 --> 00:20:47,997
I feel...

346
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:50,542
a connection with you.

347
00:20:51,502 --> 00:20:54,046
Perhaps you could talk to my father
and change his mind.

348
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:58,091
I don't know that talking
to Klyden will do any good.

349
00:20:58,175 --> 00:20:59,342
You could try.

350
00:20:59,426 --> 00:21:00,677
Topa...

351
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:05,515
this hurts me more
than you can possibly imagine,

352
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:09,185
but you have to believe me
when I tell you that I am powerless here.

353
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:10,938
As much as I hate him...

354
00:21:11,813 --> 00:21:13,857
as much as I hate his answer...

355
00:21:15,526 --> 00:21:16,985
he's your father.

356
00:21:17,528 --> 00:21:19,780
I do not want to give up.

357
00:21:20,822 --> 00:21:23,408
If I could someday be like you...

358
00:21:24,451 --> 00:21:26,244
have a noble purpose,

359
00:21:26,328 --> 00:21:29,248
to inspire people
to become their best selves...

360
00:21:29,998 --> 00:21:32,543
perhaps I would not feel so sad.

361
00:21:49,518 --> 00:21:50,685
Hey there, Topa.

362
00:21:50,769 --> 00:21:52,103
Hello, sir.

363
00:21:52,187 --> 00:21:54,907
Oh, you don't have to call me "sir"
until you're wearing a uniform.

364
00:21:56,316 --> 00:21:57,734
You wanna see something cool?

365
00:21:59,361 --> 00:22:02,822
We're using a combination of DNA
fragments embedded in the artifacts,

366
00:22:02,906 --> 00:22:04,407
along with sculptural renderings,

367
00:22:04,491 --> 00:22:07,786
to reconstruct an approximation
of the Hemblicites' appearance.

368
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:09,746
Up till now, nobody knew
what they looked like.

369
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:12,791
But thanks to modern science,
we can make a good guess.

370
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:14,168
You wanna see?

371
00:22:21,925 --> 00:22:24,094
Pretty amazing, isn't it?

372
00:22:24,178 --> 00:22:28,390
You're looking at a race that's been dead
for tens of thousands of years.

373
00:22:34,646 --> 00:22:36,023
Please excuse me.

374
00:22:47,034 --> 00:22:48,535
Hello, Topa.

375
00:22:48,619 --> 00:22:50,078
Isaac...

376
00:22:51,246 --> 00:22:54,415
What is it like? To be dead?

377
00:22:54,499 --> 00:22:57,169
It is the opposite of being alive.

378
00:22:58,045 --> 00:23:01,089
When you... deactivated yourself...

379
00:23:02,257 --> 00:23:04,217
what did it feel like?

380
00:23:04,301 --> 00:23:07,679
I was deactivated. I felt nothing.

381
00:23:08,347 --> 00:23:09,931
Were you...

382
00:23:10,015 --> 00:23:12,892
unhappy when they brought you back?

383
00:23:12,976 --> 00:23:16,062
I am incapable
of happiness or misery.

384
00:23:16,146 --> 00:23:18,982
May I ask the purpose of your inquiry?

385
00:23:20,067 --> 00:23:21,401
I was...

386
00:23:21,485 --> 00:23:23,111
just curious.

387
00:23:40,128 --> 00:23:42,673
Come in!

388
00:23:44,758 --> 00:23:46,593
Isaac. Hi.

389
00:23:46,677 --> 00:23:49,596
Hello, Commander.
I apologize for disturbing you.

390
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,972
No, it's fine. What's up?

391
00:23:51,056 --> 00:23:54,559
It is my understanding
that a visit to a crew member's quarters

392
00:23:54,643 --> 00:23:58,313
during off-duty hours
can invite speculation regarding intent.

393
00:23:58,397 --> 00:24:02,150
If you wish, I will send a ship-wide
communique assuring the crew

394
00:24:02,234 --> 00:24:05,153
that this was not a romantic
or sexual encounter.

395
00:24:05,237 --> 00:24:09,908
I... I would just not say anything,
it's all good.

396
00:24:09,992 --> 00:24:11,201
What can I do for you?

397
00:24:11,285 --> 00:24:14,579
Topa came to the astrophysics lab
to speak with me.

398
00:24:14,663 --> 00:24:19,459
He had many questions regarding
my attempt to deactivate myself.

399
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,628
What kind of questions?

400
00:24:21,712 --> 00:24:24,423
He wished to know
what it was like to be dead.

401
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:27,467
What else?

402
00:24:27,551 --> 00:24:31,180
He asked if I was...
unhappy to be revived.

403
00:24:32,848 --> 00:24:34,099
I see...

404
00:24:34,183 --> 00:24:36,601
I am aware
that Union medical protocol

405
00:24:36,685 --> 00:24:40,814
recommends disclosure of this variety
of information to a superior officer.

406
00:24:40,898 --> 00:24:43,566
It does. Thank you for telling me.

407
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:45,235
Good day, Commander.

408
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:14,472
Topa.

409
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:18,393
Commander.
I should not be speaking to you.

410
00:25:18,477 --> 00:25:20,937
It's okay, we're not talking about work.

411
00:25:21,021 --> 00:25:23,232
You're still technically
obeying your father.

412
00:25:24,191 --> 00:25:25,359
I just...

413
00:25:25,984 --> 00:25:27,360
wanted to see how you were doing.

414
00:25:27,444 --> 00:25:29,863
- I am fine.
- Yeah?

415
00:25:29,947 --> 00:25:31,323
Yes.

416
00:25:32,032 --> 00:25:35,618
You know, if there's ever anything
you needed to talk about...

417
00:25:35,702 --> 00:25:37,412
just as a friend...

418
00:25:37,496 --> 00:25:39,539
I'm here. Always.

419
00:25:39,623 --> 00:25:42,584
Thank you, Commander.
I will be all right.

420
00:25:56,765 --> 00:26:00,602
Sometimes, when I'm feeling low,
or just a little unsure of myself...

421
00:26:01,228 --> 00:26:02,646
I have a slice of Kimbok.

422
00:26:03,313 --> 00:26:04,522
Moclan Opsadda cake.

423
00:26:04,606 --> 00:26:07,609
Yeah. Usually makes me feel
a whole lot better.

424
00:26:08,151 --> 00:26:09,527
Perhaps I will have some later.

425
00:26:09,611 --> 00:26:13,198
There are several different
Kimbok recipes on file.

426
00:26:13,282 --> 00:26:17,285
You should search the database.
I'm sure you can find one to your liking.

427
00:26:17,369 --> 00:26:18,912
If you look hard enough.

428
00:26:51,528 --> 00:26:52,696
Papa?

429
00:27:01,455 --> 00:27:03,957
Inquiry. Show me "Kimbok."

430
00:27:07,503 --> 00:27:10,422
How many recipe patterns
for Kimbok are on file?

431
00:27:10,506 --> 00:27:13,800
There are
41 recipe patterns for Kimbok.

432
00:27:13,884 --> 00:27:17,221
They are available for replication
at all food synthesizers.

433
00:27:17,721 --> 00:27:20,933
Are there any other files containing
the designation "Kimbok"?

434
00:27:22,851 --> 00:27:26,312
There is one file.
Designation Kimbok33.

435
00:27:26,396 --> 00:27:30,150
Dated Union Standard 7352417.

436
00:27:30,234 --> 00:27:31,860
May I see it?

437
00:27:31,944 --> 00:27:34,029
The file is password protected.

438
00:27:42,371 --> 00:27:44,039
One piece of Kimbok.

439
00:27:55,384 --> 00:27:57,803
Incoming message.

440
00:28:13,193 --> 00:28:16,112
Access file Kimbok33.

441
00:28:16,196 --> 00:28:19,741
Password Go mask ah 488.

442
00:28:20,534 --> 00:28:22,369
Password verified.

443
00:28:46,393 --> 00:28:49,687
- It's your own fault.
- I know that.

444
00:28:49,771 --> 00:28:50,980
I just...

445
00:28:51,064 --> 00:28:54,150
He said he had another human friend
who could tolerate it.

446
00:28:54,234 --> 00:28:57,570
I've never met a single human
who could eat a Baliddian tart

447
00:28:57,654 --> 00:29:00,448
without some kind
of horrible allergic reaction.

448
00:29:00,532 --> 00:29:01,783
Well, I won't do it again.

449
00:29:01,867 --> 00:29:04,452
For God's sake, you're a grown man,
you should know better.

450
00:29:04,536 --> 00:29:06,830
It just looked super tasty.

451
00:29:06,914 --> 00:29:09,666
All those little green sprinkles
and whatnot.

452
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:12,377
Doctor. I need to talk to you.

453
00:29:12,461 --> 00:29:13,587
Sure.

454
00:29:14,505 --> 00:29:16,673
Run this over your face for three minutes.

455
00:29:21,386 --> 00:29:22,929
What's wrong with him?

456
00:29:23,013 --> 00:29:25,056
He's a child with no self-control.

457
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,558
How can I help you?

458
00:29:28,227 --> 00:29:30,311
I need to talk to you about Topa.

459
00:29:30,395 --> 00:29:31,647
And...

460
00:29:32,523 --> 00:29:34,650
I need you to tell me
if I've done a bad thing.

461
00:29:43,951 --> 00:29:45,326
Bortus.

462
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:47,579
Klyden. How was your game?

463
00:29:47,663 --> 00:29:50,582
We did not play. Topa never arrived.

464
00:29:50,666 --> 00:29:51,750
That is odd.

465
00:29:51,834 --> 00:29:54,919
He has never missed a Grand Latchkum.

466
00:29:55,003 --> 00:29:58,423
Inquiry. What is Topa's location?

467
00:29:58,507 --> 00:30:01,760
Topa is currently in crew quarters.

468
00:30:12,896 --> 00:30:15,315
Topa. Where have you been?

469
00:30:15,399 --> 00:30:17,693
I waited for you in the simulator.

470
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:21,655
Are you all right?

471
00:30:24,241 --> 00:30:26,118
Was I born female?

472
00:30:29,621 --> 00:30:31,623
- Topa...
- Answer me.

473
00:30:32,499 --> 00:30:34,918
How could you possibly ask such a thing?

474
00:30:35,002 --> 00:30:36,420
Answer me.

475
00:30:37,171 --> 00:30:38,714
Of course not!

476
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,555
Where...

477
00:30:47,472 --> 00:30:48,890
where did you get that?

478
00:30:48,974 --> 00:30:50,601
Does it matter?

479
00:30:51,226 --> 00:30:52,811
Was it Commander Grayson?

480
00:30:52,895 --> 00:30:55,396
Tell me the truth.

481
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,816
Was I born female?

482
00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:02,404
Yes.

483
00:31:14,499 --> 00:31:16,376
Why did you not tell me?

484
00:31:18,086 --> 00:31:20,255
It was for your own well-being.

485
00:31:21,215 --> 00:31:23,175
We wanted to protect you.

486
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:27,221
Were you ever going to tell me?

487
00:31:31,391 --> 00:31:33,518
We did not know.

488
00:31:33,602 --> 00:31:37,355
It did not appear to serve a purpose.

489
00:31:37,439 --> 00:31:39,316
You have been lying to me.

490
00:31:39,983 --> 00:31:42,986
My entire life has been a lie.

491
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:44,279
No!

492
00:31:44,363 --> 00:31:48,825
Topa, you were born malformed, it is true,

493
00:31:48,909 --> 00:31:50,910
but the doctors made you well!

494
00:31:50,994 --> 00:31:53,705
You are male now! That is all that...

495
00:31:53,789 --> 00:31:55,207
I may appear to be male...

496
00:31:56,458 --> 00:31:59,378
but what is inside me still exists.

497
00:32:00,587 --> 00:32:04,174
It is why I have felt the way
I have for so long.

498
00:32:05,342 --> 00:32:10,597
My body has been screaming to me
that I am someone else.

499
00:32:13,058 --> 00:32:14,351
I am...

500
00:32:16,019 --> 00:32:17,645
I am sorry.

501
00:32:17,729 --> 00:32:18,981
Topa.

502
00:32:19,565 --> 00:32:22,442
To leave you as you were would have been...

503
00:32:22,526 --> 00:32:24,277
Unthinkable.

504
00:32:24,361 --> 00:32:25,487
Yes.

505
00:32:26,113 --> 00:32:28,115
Moclus has taught me,

506
00:32:29,032 --> 00:32:31,201
you have taught me,

507
00:32:31,285 --> 00:32:33,453
that to be female...

508
00:32:33,537 --> 00:32:35,873
is an aberration of nature.

509
00:32:37,457 --> 00:32:39,292
I have heard the lesson clearly.

510
00:32:39,376 --> 00:32:44,047
Moclus is an imperfect society.
What is taught...

511
00:32:44,131 --> 00:32:46,842
- Bortus, you cannot...
- Klyden, you will be silent!

512
00:32:50,554 --> 00:32:51,930
We love you.

513
00:32:53,432 --> 00:32:56,851
For everything that you are.

514
00:32:56,935 --> 00:32:58,478
And were.

515
00:33:27,591 --> 00:33:29,092
Come in...

516
00:33:30,052 --> 00:33:32,012
How dare you!

517
00:33:32,513 --> 00:33:34,180
Is there something
I can do for you, Klyden?

518
00:33:34,264 --> 00:33:39,310
If we were on Moclus, I would be within
my rights to break your little neck.

519
00:33:39,394 --> 00:33:43,232
Well, we're not on Moclus,
but you're welcome to try.

520
00:33:45,567 --> 00:33:49,029
No? Then I suggest you back
the hell away from my desk.

521
00:33:51,156 --> 00:33:54,409
My son is in emotional ruin
because of you.

522
00:33:54,493 --> 00:33:56,536
I told him to have a slice of Kimbok.
That's all I said.

523
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:59,539
You gave him the password
for the trial records!

524
00:33:59,623 --> 00:34:00,832
No, I didn't.

525
00:34:00,916 --> 00:34:01,916
You are a liar!

526
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,085
I pointed him
in the right direction, yes, but...

527
00:34:04,169 --> 00:34:06,880
Who are you to decide
what is best for my child?!

528
00:34:06,964 --> 00:34:09,174
- Somebody has to!
- My son was content!

529
00:34:09,258 --> 00:34:11,051
Your son was miserable!

530
00:34:11,593 --> 00:34:13,970
You wrecked that kid the second
you walked into that courtroom,

531
00:34:14,054 --> 00:34:15,722
so do not try to pin this bullshit on me!

532
00:34:15,806 --> 00:34:19,225
I remember when we were
in the Kandar system.

533
00:34:19,309 --> 00:34:22,729
You were worshiped as a god
by the planet's inhabitants.

534
00:34:22,813 --> 00:34:25,648
Perhaps you still believe it yourself.

535
00:34:25,732 --> 00:34:29,402
Perhaps that is why you chose
to play god with my family.

536
00:34:29,486 --> 00:34:30,945
I played god?!

537
00:34:31,029 --> 00:34:32,906
Klyden, that kid
has been crying out for help,

538
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:35,283
and you've been burying your fat head
in the sand because the truth

539
00:34:35,367 --> 00:34:37,911
doesn't fit in
with your backward worldview!

540
00:34:37,995 --> 00:34:39,621
Now, I may have overstepped,

541
00:34:39,705 --> 00:34:42,165
but somebody needed
to start paying attention.

542
00:34:42,249 --> 00:34:44,084
Because that child is in trouble.

543
00:34:44,168 --> 00:34:47,003
And no matter how much
it hurts you to know it,

544
00:34:47,087 --> 00:34:49,547
underneath that manufactured exterior,

545
00:34:49,631 --> 00:34:52,092
Topa is still female.

546
00:34:57,472 --> 00:35:00,475
I'm gonna use my imagination
and pretend that didn't just happen.

547
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:04,104
And then I'm gonna let go, and you're
gonna get the hell out of my office.

548
00:35:04,188 --> 00:35:07,357
And if you ever try to strike
an officer again,

549
00:35:07,441 --> 00:35:10,902
I'm gonna break your goddamn arm off
and mount it on my wall.

550
00:35:10,986 --> 00:35:12,237
You hear me?

551
00:35:13,238 --> 00:35:14,197
Do you hear me?

552
00:35:14,281 --> 00:35:15,616
Yes!

553
00:35:57,449 --> 00:35:58,700
Come in.

554
00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:02,495
Bortus...

555
00:36:02,579 --> 00:36:04,623
I am sorry to intrude, Commander.

556
00:36:05,207 --> 00:36:07,376
No, please, come on in.

557
00:36:08,252 --> 00:36:10,044
I require your help.

558
00:36:10,128 --> 00:36:11,296
Of course.

559
00:36:12,422 --> 00:36:15,717
Topa will not speak to Klyden, or to me.

560
00:36:17,511 --> 00:36:18,512
I know.

561
00:36:20,305 --> 00:36:23,392
If it means anything,
Claire's been able to talk to him.

562
00:36:24,434 --> 00:36:27,145
It's a good sign,
at least he's opening up to someone.

563
00:36:28,605 --> 00:36:30,107
It may just take some time.

564
00:36:35,612 --> 00:36:36,947
Sit down, please.

565
00:36:47,124 --> 00:36:48,333
Bortus...

566
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:52,045
I am so sorry I caused this.

567
00:36:53,463 --> 00:36:54,506
I...

568
00:36:56,008 --> 00:37:01,013
I just saw this kid
in a place of such despair, and...

569
00:37:02,931 --> 00:37:04,850
I was only trying to help him.

570
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:11,315
But the fact is, I was way out of line.

571
00:37:11,982 --> 00:37:13,233
It wasn't my place.

572
00:37:14,568 --> 00:37:16,570
You are not responsible.

573
00:37:17,404 --> 00:37:19,989
I was the one
who led him to the Kimbok file.

574
00:37:20,073 --> 00:37:21,992
I gave him the password.

575
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:25,954
What?

576
00:37:26,496 --> 00:37:28,039
I was on the bridge.

577
00:37:28,123 --> 00:37:32,836
Commander Keyali was occupied,
and I was monitoring the security station.

578
00:37:34,213 --> 00:37:38,592
There was an alert that someone
was attempting to access a coded file.

579
00:37:39,635 --> 00:37:41,469
I saw that it was Topa.

580
00:37:41,553 --> 00:37:42,638
So...

581
00:37:44,515 --> 00:37:46,183
I sent it to him.

582
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,687
You wanted him to know.

583
00:37:54,191 --> 00:37:55,442
It...

584
00:37:56,318 --> 00:37:57,694
happened in the moment.

585
00:37:57,778 --> 00:38:00,113
It was not premeditated.

586
00:38:01,281 --> 00:38:02,574
Have you told him?

587
00:38:03,075 --> 00:38:04,826
No, no.

588
00:38:07,538 --> 00:38:09,081
But I do not...

589
00:38:11,083 --> 00:38:13,085
I do not know how to help him!

590
00:38:53,959 --> 00:38:55,126
How's the patient?

591
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:57,337
Well, the good news is,

592
00:38:57,421 --> 00:38:59,506
I'm not worried about self-harm
at the moment.

593
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:03,218
Regardless of the psychological upheaval
caused by this discovery,

594
00:39:03,302 --> 00:39:06,096
I genuinely believe
you did the right thing.

595
00:39:06,805 --> 00:39:08,515
I wish I had your confidence.

596
00:39:08,599 --> 00:39:09,974
It was a reckless move.

597
00:39:10,058 --> 00:39:15,063
Well, that's why the most important
thing we can do right now is listen.

598
00:39:15,898 --> 00:39:17,774
Topa is going to have to guide us.

599
00:39:18,525 --> 00:39:19,610
Can I go in?

600
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:29,410
Hi.

601
00:39:33,498 --> 00:39:35,041
You knew.

602
00:39:35,125 --> 00:39:38,378
I wanted to tell you a lot sooner.
I just...

603
00:39:39,713 --> 00:39:41,256
They're your parents.

604
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:43,675
I did as much as I dared.

605
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:48,179
I wish I did not know.

606
00:39:48,263 --> 00:39:50,390
Oh, Topa...

607
00:39:51,517 --> 00:39:53,018
I'm so sorry.

608
00:39:53,602 --> 00:39:54,686
No.

609
00:39:55,103 --> 00:39:57,147
No, I do not mean what I say.

610
00:39:58,273 --> 00:39:59,774
I'm still here.

611
00:39:59,858 --> 00:40:02,569
If you need someone to talk to,
day or night.

612
00:40:04,655 --> 00:40:06,281
What do I do?

613
00:40:07,991 --> 00:40:10,035
You're the only person
who can answer that.

614
00:40:11,495 --> 00:40:15,165
But however you choose to process this...

615
00:40:15,249 --> 00:40:16,792
I'm on your side.

616
00:40:18,001 --> 00:40:20,962
I know many females.

617
00:40:21,046 --> 00:40:24,174
But they are all from other worlds.

618
00:40:24,925 --> 00:40:27,677
You... Commander Keyali...

619
00:40:27,761 --> 00:40:29,513
Dr. Finn...

620
00:40:30,013 --> 00:40:31,682
but no Moclans.

621
00:40:32,975 --> 00:40:34,268
I wish...

622
00:40:35,018 --> 00:40:36,937
I could meet a Moclan female.

623
00:40:37,563 --> 00:40:40,148
But my father would never allow it.

624
00:40:42,901 --> 00:40:44,653
Maybe he doesn't have to.

625
00:40:52,828 --> 00:40:57,916
Access all audiovisual data
pertaining to file designation Kimbok33.

626
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,462
Reference logs beginning
at time index 8490.5.

627
00:41:02,546 --> 00:41:04,965
Integrate, and create simulation.

628
00:41:06,008 --> 00:41:08,093
Simulation ready.

629
00:41:09,553 --> 00:41:11,597
Begin simulation and hold.

630
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:26,111
Is that...

631
00:41:26,195 --> 00:41:27,278
Heveena.

632
00:41:27,362 --> 00:41:29,906
The writer the Moclans knew
as Gondus Elden,

633
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:31,950
before she revealed she was female.

634
00:41:32,743 --> 00:41:36,205
This is the courtroom
where your fate was decided.

635
00:42:04,816 --> 00:42:07,110
I read about her in the Kimbok file.

636
00:42:07,694 --> 00:42:10,280
But it did not describe her appearance.

637
00:42:10,864 --> 00:42:14,242
Her face appears so wise.

638
00:42:14,326 --> 00:42:16,578
Wait till you hear her speak.

639
00:42:16,662 --> 00:42:18,789
Resume simulation.

640
00:42:20,499 --> 00:42:23,501
When I was born, long ago,

641
00:42:23,585 --> 00:42:29,091
my parents made the choice
to allow me to remain female.

642
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:34,680
They believed that to have me altered
would be an offense to nature.

643
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:38,224
So they took me far up into the mountains

644
00:42:38,308 --> 00:42:42,563
and built our family a home in seclusion.

645
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:45,482
They taught me to think.

646
00:42:45,566 --> 00:42:46,858
To read.

647
00:42:46,942 --> 00:42:48,485
To wonder.

648
00:42:48,569 --> 00:42:51,947
They taught me to love the person I was.

649
00:42:52,948 --> 00:42:56,993
When they passed, I remained.

650
00:42:57,077 --> 00:42:59,746
I had planned to die up there.

651
00:42:59,830 --> 00:43:01,999
Undiscovered.

652
00:43:03,125 --> 00:43:05,419
But that is no longer possible.

653
00:43:07,004 --> 00:43:10,298
The tribunal must not be allowed
to take from this child

654
00:43:10,382 --> 00:43:12,759
the gift that I was given.

655
00:43:13,343 --> 00:43:16,054
So I present myself to you

656
00:43:16,138 --> 00:43:19,433
as a woman without regret.

657
00:43:20,434 --> 00:43:22,769
I am happy.

658
00:43:53,133 --> 00:43:54,426
Doctor.

659
00:43:54,510 --> 00:43:56,094
What is it?

660
00:43:59,097 --> 00:44:01,433
I am female.

661
00:44:07,397 --> 00:44:08,940
This is preposterous!

662
00:44:09,024 --> 00:44:12,068
Do you have any idea
what you are suggesting?!

663
00:44:12,152 --> 00:44:13,611
Look, this kid has been

664
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:16,406
at the center of a cultural cyclone
since the day she was born.

665
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:19,325
It's about time that we all stop trying
to decide who she is,

666
00:44:19,409 --> 00:44:21,619
shut the hell up, and let her tell us.

667
00:44:21,703 --> 00:44:24,372
He does not understand what awaits him!

668
00:44:24,456 --> 00:44:27,125
Really? You've been telling her
since she was a young child

669
00:44:27,209 --> 00:44:28,334
that females are garbage.

670
00:44:28,418 --> 00:44:29,586
She's well aware, Klyden.

671
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:30,879
Stop using that word!

672
00:44:30,963 --> 00:44:32,881
And she's still
standing by her decision.

673
00:44:32,965 --> 00:44:34,883
Seems like she's
pretty sure of what she wants.

674
00:44:34,967 --> 00:44:37,511
Bortus. What do you think?

675
00:44:42,683 --> 00:44:44,059
I believe...

676
00:44:45,936 --> 00:44:48,564
that Commander Grayson is correct.

677
00:44:49,273 --> 00:44:51,357
Topa has the right to decide.

678
00:44:51,441 --> 00:44:53,819
Bortus, have you lost your mind?!

679
00:44:54,945 --> 00:44:58,198
Claire, is this an issue
of personal identity alone,

680
00:44:58,282 --> 00:44:59,282
or has Topa...?

681
00:44:59,366 --> 00:45:02,869
Topa has asked me
to reverse the procedure, yes.

682
00:45:02,953 --> 00:45:06,164
She wants her physical body
to represent its origins.

683
00:45:06,248 --> 00:45:08,041
And obviously that's possible.

684
00:45:08,125 --> 00:45:10,668
It is possible, yes. And very simple.

685
00:45:10,752 --> 00:45:12,003
You are a doctor!

686
00:45:12,087 --> 00:45:17,092
You must realize that Topa
is too young to make this decision!

687
00:45:17,176 --> 00:45:18,718
Are you hearing yourself?

688
00:45:18,802 --> 00:45:21,971
Seriously, are you completely oblivious
to the hypocrisy of what you just said?

689
00:45:22,055 --> 00:45:23,098
He is an adolescent!

690
00:45:23,182 --> 00:45:24,808
- She was a baby!
- Doctor.

691
00:45:27,436 --> 00:45:30,272
Is there any psychological risk?

692
00:45:31,481 --> 00:45:35,026
Under normal circumstances,
I couldn't do what's being asked

693
00:45:35,110 --> 00:45:37,195
until the child reached adulthood,

694
00:45:37,279 --> 00:45:40,740
but, to be blunt,
Topa's history makes it all a wash.

695
00:45:40,824 --> 00:45:42,867
It's impactful either way.

696
00:45:42,951 --> 00:45:45,787
So, in my professional opinion,
the tipping factor

697
00:45:45,871 --> 00:45:47,705
should be the wishes of Topa herself.

698
00:45:47,789 --> 00:45:50,458
And there's a very reasonable argument

699
00:45:50,542 --> 00:45:53,086
that we'd simply be restoring
what was taken from her.

700
00:45:53,170 --> 00:45:56,381
It is immoral, and it is illegal!

701
00:45:56,465 --> 00:45:58,466
On Moclus. We're not on Moclus.

702
00:45:58,550 --> 00:46:00,135
- I forbid it!
- It's not up to you.

703
00:46:00,219 --> 00:46:02,971
- I am his father!
- And so is Bortus.

704
00:46:05,641 --> 00:46:07,851
Where medical issues are concerned,

705
00:46:07,935 --> 00:46:11,813
Union law states that if a child
is not of legal age

706
00:46:11,897 --> 00:46:13,606
to make the decision on their own,

707
00:46:13,690 --> 00:46:17,944
it requires the consent
of at least one parent or guardian.

708
00:46:18,028 --> 00:46:19,696
Doesn't require both.

709
00:46:22,074 --> 00:46:23,575
Bortus?

710
00:46:30,624 --> 00:46:32,501
If you do this...

711
00:46:33,168 --> 00:46:35,378
I will leave you.

712
00:46:35,462 --> 00:46:37,422
I swear it.

713
00:46:37,506 --> 00:46:42,386
And I will not even give you
the dignity of the sword.

714
00:46:48,684 --> 00:46:49,893
Captain.

715
00:46:50,519 --> 00:46:54,773
There is another factor
that we have not discussed.

716
00:46:54,857 --> 00:46:56,108
I know.

717
00:46:57,526 --> 00:47:03,031
Even with Bortus's consent,
it may not be that simple.

718
00:47:05,742 --> 00:47:08,871
You should know that this is not
something we take lightly.

719
00:47:09,663 --> 00:47:11,748
The Union council conferred
with the Admiralty

720
00:47:11,832 --> 00:47:14,417
for no less than nine hours
on the subject.

721
00:47:14,501 --> 00:47:16,044
But it is abundantly clear

722
00:47:16,128 --> 00:47:19,506
that this would deeply imperil
our relationship with the Moclans.

723
00:47:19,590 --> 00:47:23,301
With the Krill treaty in ruins
and the Kaylon waiting at our doorstep,

724
00:47:23,385 --> 00:47:25,386
we just can't take the risk.

725
00:47:25,470 --> 00:47:28,306
Therefore, Dr. Finn,

726
00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:32,227
it is my unhappy duty to order you
not to perform this procedure.

727
00:47:32,311 --> 00:47:33,269
What?

728
00:47:33,353 --> 00:47:35,063
Excuse me, sir.

729
00:47:35,147 --> 00:47:37,565
We have checked every legal box.

730
00:47:37,649 --> 00:47:40,360
Topa has requested it.
Bortus has consented.

731
00:47:40,444 --> 00:47:42,612
Everyone involved
is within their legal rights.

732
00:47:42,696 --> 00:47:45,031
Civil law permits it, you are correct.

733
00:47:45,115 --> 00:47:47,408
But you're on a Fleet ship
with a Fleet doctor.

734
00:47:47,492 --> 00:47:49,285
We can't allow it.

735
00:47:49,369 --> 00:47:53,039
Sir, I understand the danger, but...

736
00:47:53,123 --> 00:47:55,959
how the hell much longer
are we going to let this go on?

737
00:47:56,043 --> 00:47:57,919
I mean, you are basically
allowing the Moclans

738
00:47:58,003 --> 00:48:00,380
to dictate human rights policy
for the Union.

739
00:48:00,464 --> 00:48:03,299
I don't want this to drag on
any more than you do, Captain.

740
00:48:03,383 --> 00:48:05,510
You don't think I hate making this call?

741
00:48:05,594 --> 00:48:08,680
But we're desperately trying
to save lives here.

742
00:48:08,764 --> 00:48:12,517
Without the Moclans, we become
utterly vulnerable to the Kaylon.

743
00:48:12,601 --> 00:48:16,521
This procedure won't help Topa
if she's dead.

744
00:48:16,605 --> 00:48:18,189
Can we speak to Rechik?

745
00:48:18,273 --> 00:48:20,066
Rechik wanted to be in this meeting

746
00:48:20,150 --> 00:48:22,193
along with the two other
Moclan councilmen.

747
00:48:22,277 --> 00:48:25,447
I told him no.
Trust me, I'm doing you a favor.

748
00:48:25,531 --> 00:48:28,616
This issue is a lightning rod
for the Moclans.

749
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:31,494
The trial was
a defining moment that, to them,

750
00:48:31,578 --> 00:48:33,705
reinforced their cultural foundations.

751
00:48:33,789 --> 00:48:37,167
I'm telling you, I have been
doing this job a long time.

752
00:48:37,251 --> 00:48:40,003
If we defy their custom
and invalidate that verdict

753
00:48:40,087 --> 00:48:43,715
by allowing a Union medical officer
to do this,

754
00:48:43,799 --> 00:48:45,592
the Moclans will be humiliated,

755
00:48:45,676 --> 00:48:49,971
and trust me, they will walk,
and billions could die as a result.

756
00:48:50,055 --> 00:48:52,307
Would the Moclans
really want to cut ties

757
00:48:52,391 --> 00:48:53,641
and face the Kaylon alone?

758
00:48:53,725 --> 00:48:55,435
Want is irrelevant.

759
00:48:55,519 --> 00:48:58,272
They'd have no way to save face
if they didn't.

760
00:48:59,106 --> 00:49:02,693
Admiral. You have children, don't you?

761
00:49:04,152 --> 00:49:05,153
Yes.

762
00:49:05,737 --> 00:49:09,491
If Topa was your child,
how would you explain this to her?

763
00:49:09,575 --> 00:49:12,410
That we're forcing her to spend
the rest of her days

764
00:49:12,494 --> 00:49:15,872
living a lie to protect
the political status quo?

765
00:49:15,956 --> 00:49:19,918
If Topa wants to leave the ship
and have the procedure done elsewhere,

766
00:49:20,002 --> 00:49:21,628
we have no jurisdiction.

767
00:49:22,212 --> 00:49:23,588
She would not succeed.

768
00:49:23,672 --> 00:49:26,299
The Moclans would pounce on her
without Union protection.

769
00:49:26,383 --> 00:49:29,177
She'd be captured
and sent to prison in a heartbeat.

770
00:49:29,261 --> 00:49:32,222
Captain, I empathize with all of you.

771
00:49:32,306 --> 00:49:34,140
Please believe me.

772
00:49:34,224 --> 00:49:36,392
But our hands are tied.

773
00:49:36,476 --> 00:49:38,520
I'm very sorry.

774
00:49:44,568 --> 00:49:46,069
My God.

775
00:49:46,987 --> 00:49:48,822
How are we going to tell her?

776
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:52,492
I will speak to Topa.

777
00:49:55,287 --> 00:49:58,707
Commander, if it is not too difficult...

778
00:50:00,125 --> 00:50:01,585
I'll come too.

779
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:17,976
It is not fair.

780
00:50:19,102 --> 00:50:21,355
No. It is not.

781
00:50:23,398 --> 00:50:25,275
Haven't they done enough?

782
00:50:25,859 --> 00:50:27,610
When does it stop?

783
00:50:27,694 --> 00:50:30,656
When do I get to decide
how to live my own life?

784
00:50:32,324 --> 00:50:33,909
Never.

785
00:50:34,493 --> 00:50:36,953
It will always be decided for me.

786
00:50:37,037 --> 00:50:38,789
By other people.

787
00:50:39,706 --> 00:50:41,291
I hate this universe.

788
00:50:41,375 --> 00:50:44,753
Topa. This isn't over.
We're going to keep fighting it.

789
00:50:44,837 --> 00:50:47,089
- How?
- We'll find a way.

790
00:50:47,589 --> 00:50:48,799
Do not bother.

791
00:50:49,591 --> 00:50:53,803
If they insist that I am male,
then that is what I will be.

792
00:50:53,887 --> 00:50:54,971
Topa...

793
00:50:55,055 --> 00:50:56,139
May I go now?

794
00:50:56,223 --> 00:50:58,600
- If there...
- May I go?

795
00:51:00,602 --> 00:51:01,603
Of course.

796
00:51:31,466 --> 00:51:34,344
Boy, you really did a number
on yourself, didn't you?

797
00:51:34,428 --> 00:51:36,471
Yeah, I was just careless.

798
00:51:36,555 --> 00:51:38,724
Good news is,
we've covered the last of the catacombs.

799
00:51:43,562 --> 00:51:46,356
Okay, try standing up slowly.

800
00:51:48,567 --> 00:51:50,402
Thing of beauty. Thanks, Doc.

801
00:51:51,486 --> 00:51:53,446
Captain, we've hit the end
of the line down there.

802
00:51:53,530 --> 00:51:55,115
It's all been mapped out
for the science team,

803
00:51:55,199 --> 00:51:56,658
so there shouldn't be any surprises.

804
00:51:56,742 --> 00:51:58,993
I can have a detailed chart to you
by the end of the day.

805
00:51:59,077 --> 00:52:01,204
Good work.
You can prep the shuttle for departure.

806
00:52:01,288 --> 00:52:02,330
Aye, sir.

807
00:52:02,414 --> 00:52:04,290
Talla. What's the latest?

808
00:52:04,374 --> 00:52:05,500
All cleared, sir.

809
00:52:05,584 --> 00:52:07,710
We've de-fanged almost
every booby trap in the place.

810
00:52:07,794 --> 00:52:10,046
There are a few we can't get to
without damaging the architecture,

811
00:52:10,130 --> 00:52:12,090
but I'm working with Charly
to place markers on the map.

812
00:52:12,174 --> 00:52:13,926
All right, start rounding up the team.

813
00:52:14,676 --> 00:52:18,055
Sir, if I can ask... how's Topa?

814
00:52:20,057 --> 00:52:21,182
Not good.

815
00:52:21,266 --> 00:52:23,810
Will you tell her that the entire crew
is pulling for her?

816
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:28,189
Captain... I had a thought.

817
00:52:28,273 --> 00:52:29,441
What is it?

818
00:52:29,525 --> 00:52:30,943
What if...

819
00:52:31,902 --> 00:52:33,862
What if I resigned my commission?

820
00:52:34,738 --> 00:52:37,699
Admiral How land says
that a Fleet medical officer

821
00:52:37,783 --> 00:52:39,200
can't do the procedure.

822
00:52:39,284 --> 00:52:40,410
Fine.

823
00:52:40,494 --> 00:52:42,454
Then I won't be a Fleet officer.

824
00:52:42,538 --> 00:52:44,331
I'll be a civilian doctor.

825
00:52:45,165 --> 00:52:46,624
Claire, that's...

826
00:52:46,708 --> 00:52:48,293
very noble.

827
00:52:48,377 --> 00:52:51,713
But you've dedicated
your entire career to the Fleet.

828
00:52:51,797 --> 00:52:54,883
It's not like you can do that
and just jump right back in.

829
00:52:54,967 --> 00:52:57,635
Your professional life
as you know it would be over.

830
00:52:57,719 --> 00:53:00,388
Not to mention, you'd probably
become a target for the Moclans.

831
00:53:00,472 --> 00:53:03,600
But it would give the Admirals
plausible deniability.

832
00:53:03,684 --> 00:53:04,809
Technically.

833
00:53:04,893 --> 00:53:07,937
And the Moclans could remain
in the Union and still save face.

834
00:53:08,021 --> 00:53:09,564
Again, technically.

835
00:53:09,648 --> 00:53:11,275
It may be enough.

836
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:13,818
Look...

837
00:53:13,902 --> 00:53:16,321
this would have to be
entirely your decision.

838
00:53:16,405 --> 00:53:20,617
Every member of the crew would have to be
able to claim honestly, under oath,

839
00:53:20,701 --> 00:53:23,620
that they did not aid or witness
the procedure.

840
00:53:24,496 --> 00:53:27,874
Claire. Are you sure
you really want to do this?

841
00:53:27,958 --> 00:53:29,667
You'd be saying goodbye to the Orville.

842
00:53:29,751 --> 00:53:31,878
We're talking about Topa's life.

843
00:53:31,962 --> 00:53:33,922
I think it's a fair trade.

844
00:53:34,006 --> 00:53:36,633
So I won't be a Union officer.

845
00:53:37,134 --> 00:53:38,468
I'll be okay.

846
00:53:38,552 --> 00:53:39,720
Excuse me, Doctor.

847
00:53:40,762 --> 00:53:43,015
I am not a Union officer.

848
00:53:43,724 --> 00:53:44,599
What?

849
00:53:44,683 --> 00:53:46,559
I have never been commissioned.

850
00:53:46,643 --> 00:53:48,728
I came to the Orville as an emissary.

851
00:53:48,812 --> 00:53:51,189
That designation has never been altered.

852
00:53:51,273 --> 00:53:53,066
What are you getting at?

853
00:53:53,150 --> 00:53:55,110
I could perform the procedure.

854
00:53:55,611 --> 00:53:56,486
You?

855
00:53:56,570 --> 00:53:58,196
I am quite capable.

856
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:01,741
All required medical data is available
from the ship's computer.

857
00:54:01,825 --> 00:54:03,743
I could upload it to my core memory,

858
00:54:03,827 --> 00:54:07,331
along with any additional specifications
you may wish to include.

859
00:54:07,915 --> 00:54:10,792
Isaac, you're... not a doctor.

860
00:54:10,876 --> 00:54:12,710
I am an artificial life form

861
00:54:12,794 --> 00:54:15,296
capable of executing complex algorithms

862
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:17,715
demanding extreme physical dexterity.

863
00:54:17,799 --> 00:54:21,010
For me, there is no difference
between performing surgery,

864
00:54:21,094 --> 00:54:24,472
playing a piano concerto,
or re-aligning a scanner array.

865
00:54:24,556 --> 00:54:28,852
In effect, I can indeed be... a doctor.

866
00:54:30,938 --> 00:54:31,938
Claire?

867
00:54:33,398 --> 00:54:34,983
He's right.

868
00:54:39,738 --> 00:54:41,030
Isaac.

869
00:54:41,114 --> 00:54:43,950
I am officially ordering you
not to interfere.

870
00:54:44,034 --> 00:54:47,871
Which means if you did this,
you would be doing it on your own.

871
00:54:47,955 --> 00:54:49,456
Without my knowledge,

872
00:54:49,540 --> 00:54:52,584
and without the knowledge
of any crew member aboard the Orville.

873
00:54:52,668 --> 00:54:54,627
I understand, sir.

874
00:54:54,711 --> 00:54:56,671
It would be...

875
00:54:56,755 --> 00:54:59,299
unfortunate if a member
of the crew visited sickbay

876
00:54:59,383 --> 00:55:01,635
during that hypothetical window.

877
00:55:02,427 --> 00:55:03,971
I've got an idea.

878
00:55:12,312 --> 00:55:14,981
All hands, this is the captain.

879
00:55:15,065 --> 00:55:18,693
I'm pleased to inform you there will be
a very special performance this evening

880
00:55:18,777 --> 00:55:19,652
in the shuttle bay.

881
00:55:19,736 --> 00:55:23,573
As many of you are aware,
our second officer, Commander Bortus,

882
00:55:23,657 --> 00:55:26,201
also happens to be a very gifted singer.

883
00:55:26,285 --> 00:55:29,245
He has not thus far graced us
with his talents,

884
00:55:29,329 --> 00:55:31,414
but tonight at 2100 hours,

885
00:55:31,498 --> 00:55:34,751
he will be performing
selections from the musical repertoires

886
00:55:34,835 --> 00:55:37,420
of 16 different Union planets.

887
00:55:37,504 --> 00:55:41,717
If you'd care to attend, please submit
a notification to Commander Keyali.

888
00:55:47,681 --> 00:55:49,974
Damn. You're a hot ticket, Bortus.

889
00:55:50,058 --> 00:55:52,435
I will be sure to bring my,

890
00:55:52,519 --> 00:55:55,314
what does Lieutenant Malloy call it?

891
00:55:56,231 --> 00:55:57,315
My "A" game.

892
00:55:57,399 --> 00:55:58,734
There ya go, buddy.

893
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:02,821
Looks to me like
we may have a full house.

894
00:57:35,956 --> 00:57:37,124
Thank you.

895
00:57:37,666 --> 00:57:40,960
This song was taught to me by Dr. Finn.

896
00:57:41,044 --> 00:57:44,756
She says it is one of her favorites.

897
00:57:46,842 --> 00:57:50,303
<i>Playing tranquil introduction...</i>

898
00:57:50,387 --> 00:57:52,722
That key is too high!

899
00:57:52,806 --> 00:57:54,433

Please come with me.

915
00:59:34,241 --> 00:59:37,202
- Why?
- I am here to help.

916
00:59:53,635 --> 00:59:56,638
Please disrobe
and recline on the medical bed.

917
01:00:01,143 --> 01:00:02,143
I'm...

918
01:00:03,687 --> 01:00:05,314
Is there some difficulty?

919
01:00:05,981 --> 01:00:08,025
Isaac, I'm...

920
01:00:09,651 --> 01:00:10,944
I'm afraid.

921
01:00:11,028 --> 01:00:13,363
Do you wish to abstain
from the procedure?

922
01:00:13,447 --> 01:00:15,866
No. I want it.

923
01:00:16,366 --> 01:00:17,784
But...

924
01:00:17,868 --> 01:00:20,078
are you sure I will be all right?

925
01:00:20,162 --> 01:00:21,830
I am quite certain.

926
01:00:21,914 --> 01:00:23,248
Our time is finite.

927
01:00:23,332 --> 01:00:24,958
Please disrobe.

928
01:00:26,043 --> 01:00:27,544
I wish Dr. Finn was here.

929
01:00:27,628 --> 01:00:30,631
Dr. Finn is unable
to perform the procedure.

930
01:00:31,507 --> 01:00:32,799
Maybe...

931
01:00:33,634 --> 01:00:35,427
I would not be so nervous.

932
01:00:35,511 --> 01:00:39,932
You are referring to what
Dr. Finn calls a "bedside manner."

933
01:00:44,269 --> 01:00:46,354
I will make sure that you are safe.

934
01:00:46,438 --> 01:00:49,399
You do not need to be afraid.

935
01:01:01,828 --> 01:01:03,663
Topa! What are you doing?!

936
01:01:03,747 --> 01:01:06,458
- Papa...
- You will come with me at once!

937
01:01:06,542 --> 01:01:08,084
Get out of my way, Kaylon.

938
01:01:08,168 --> 01:01:10,837
I am afraid that will not be possible.

939
01:01:10,921 --> 01:01:13,173
I will not permit you to disrupt
the procedure.

940
01:01:13,257 --> 01:01:16,634
I forbid you to do this!
You will destroy him!

941
01:01:16,718 --> 01:01:18,094
That is inaccurate.

942
01:01:18,178 --> 01:01:19,596
He will be altered physically,

943
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:22,724
but he will remain a fully functioning
biological organism.

944
01:01:22,808 --> 01:01:25,059
He will be a monstrosity!

945
01:01:25,143 --> 01:01:27,020
That is also inaccurate.

946
01:01:27,104 --> 01:01:29,647
I surmise your capacity to reason

947
01:01:29,731 --> 01:01:32,484
has been compromised
by your cultural indoctrination.

948
01:01:32,568 --> 01:01:35,737
This is to be expected. Please depart.

949
01:02:13,358 --> 01:02:15,319

The USS Newton has assumed
synchronous orbit, Captain.

960
01:05:42,109 --> 01:05:45,653
Science teams are requesting permission
to begin offloading the artifacts.

961
01:05:45,737 --> 01:05:47,655
Permission granted.

962
01:05:47,739 --> 01:05:50,366
Captain, I'm receiving a message
from Admiral How land.

963
01:05:50,450 --> 01:05:51,826
She's arrived aboard the Newton.

964
01:05:51,910 --> 01:05:54,746
She'd like to meet with you
and Commander Grayson in your office.

965
01:06:02,629 --> 01:06:06,550
Do you have difficulty understanding
simple speech, Captain?

966
01:06:07,259 --> 01:06:08,676
No, sir.

967
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:11,096
- Do you, Commander?
- No, sir.

968
01:06:11,180 --> 01:06:13,807
Yet, for some
completely mystifying reason,

969
01:06:13,891 --> 01:06:17,102
my crystal-clear orders
were blatantly disobeyed.

970
01:06:17,186 --> 01:06:18,728
I take full responsibility...

971
01:06:18,812 --> 01:06:23,399
You will speak when spoken to, Captain,
do you understand me?!

972
01:06:23,483 --> 01:06:25,276
Yes, sir, Admiral.

973
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:28,071
You seem to think that
your personal judgment is more sound

974
01:06:28,155 --> 01:06:30,698
than the judgment
of the entire Union Council.

975
01:06:30,782 --> 01:06:34,119
That is a staggeringly arrogant
point of view, wouldn't you say?

976
01:06:34,203 --> 01:06:35,787
- Yes, sir.
- What's that?

977
01:06:35,871 --> 01:06:36,871
Yes, sir!

978
01:06:37,831 --> 01:06:42,794
You ignored a decision
handed down by your superiors

979
01:06:42,878 --> 01:06:45,422
and committed an act
of outright disobedience,

980
01:06:45,506 --> 01:06:47,340
thereby jeopardizing an alliance

981
01:06:47,424 --> 01:06:49,509
that is one of our only barriers

982
01:06:49,593 --> 01:06:53,054
against annihilation
from an outside force!

983
01:06:53,138 --> 01:06:57,851
We were unaware the procedure
was occurring, sir.

984
01:06:58,727 --> 01:07:03,273
Well, then that makes you insubordinate
and incompetent, doesn't it?

985
01:07:03,815 --> 01:07:05,567
Yes, sir, it does.

986
01:07:07,027 --> 01:07:10,405
The Moclans are understandably furious

987
01:07:10,489 --> 01:07:13,367
about this flagrant disregard
for their culture.

988
01:07:14,076 --> 01:07:17,454
However, they have decided
that the time is not right

989
01:07:17,538 --> 01:07:20,040
to withdraw their Union membership.

990
01:07:20,874 --> 01:07:23,668
In addition, the fact that a Kaylon
performed the procedure

991
01:07:23,752 --> 01:07:26,379
has further heightened
their resolve to restrain

992
01:07:26,463 --> 01:07:29,049
and vanquish the Kaylon threat.

993
01:07:30,133 --> 01:07:33,178
Some would say that makes
your actions commendable.

994
01:07:34,805 --> 01:07:39,226
Well, I say you just got lucky.

995
01:07:39,977 --> 01:07:42,353
And if either of you ever again
step out of line,

996
01:07:42,437 --> 01:07:44,898
and I mean so much as a wrinkle
in your uniform

997
01:07:44,982 --> 01:07:48,235
or a blemish on your shoes,
you are finished!

998
01:07:49,236 --> 01:07:50,820
Do I make myself clear?

999
01:07:50,904 --> 01:07:51,989
Yes, sir.

1000
01:07:58,912 --> 01:08:03,458
Please, extend my best wishes
to the Moclan girl.

1001
01:08:22,978 --> 01:08:26,440
Klyden. You do not have to do this.

1002
01:08:27,065 --> 01:08:30,110
Papa. I had to.

1003
01:08:30,194 --> 01:08:33,030
I could not live my life
the way you wanted me to.

1004
01:08:33,739 --> 01:08:35,073
It would have been a lie.

1005
01:08:37,743 --> 01:08:42,247
Have you no room in your heart
for tolerance?

1006
01:08:44,416 --> 01:08:47,293
What inner fulfillment are you enjoying

1007
01:08:47,377 --> 01:08:49,546
from this devotion to tradition

1008
01:08:50,255 --> 01:08:54,676
that is so potent
it drives you from your family?

1009
01:09:00,974 --> 01:09:02,392
Papa.

1010
01:09:02,476 --> 01:09:04,520
I love you.

1011
01:09:07,773 --> 01:09:10,442
I wish you were never born.

1012
01:09:24,289 --> 01:09:26,416
Listen very closely to me.

1013
01:09:28,043 --> 01:09:31,338
You are perfect.

1014
01:09:48,146 --> 01:09:50,566
- Hi.
- Hello, Doctor.

1015
01:09:51,316 --> 01:09:53,693
You've been pretty reclusive lately.

1016
01:09:53,777 --> 01:09:57,113
Since the Hemblicite artifacts
have been offloaded to the Newton,

1017
01:09:57,197 --> 01:09:58,323
I have had the opportunity

1018
01:09:58,407 --> 01:10:01,159
to analyze the accumulated data
in more detail.

1019
01:10:01,243 --> 01:10:02,870
It is quite illuminating.

1020
01:10:05,747 --> 01:10:06,999
You know...

1021
01:10:08,625 --> 01:10:11,336
you did a good thing, Isaac.

1022
01:10:11,420 --> 01:10:12,880
I am aware of that.

1023
01:10:13,589 --> 01:10:15,883
Topa is very grateful.

1024
01:10:17,092 --> 01:10:19,469
Maybe that means something to you?

1025
01:10:19,553 --> 01:10:20,846
It does not.

1026
01:10:22,097 --> 01:10:23,014
Of course.

1027
01:10:23,098 --> 01:10:26,226
I did not perform
the procedure for Topa's benefit.

1028
01:10:26,310 --> 01:10:27,519
You...

1029
01:10:28,645 --> 01:10:30,105
I-I don't understand.

1030
01:10:30,189 --> 01:10:32,816
We are both aware
that my presence on the ship

1031
01:10:32,900 --> 01:10:34,692
is a disruptive element.

1032
01:10:34,776 --> 01:10:36,778
The crew is not fond of me.

1033
01:10:36,862 --> 01:10:38,321
This is understandable.

1034
01:10:38,405 --> 01:10:42,700
Given their affection for Topa,
I reasoned that by assisting her,

1035
01:10:42,784 --> 01:10:45,328
I could improve my standing
aboard the Orville.

1036
01:10:45,412 --> 01:10:47,247
This would increase crew efficiency

1037
01:10:47,331 --> 01:10:50,000
on occasions during which
they must interact with me.

1038
01:10:51,084 --> 01:10:54,838
And maybe they'd like you a little more.

1039
01:10:54,922 --> 01:10:56,757
That is also possible.

1040
01:10:57,591 --> 01:10:58,800
Isaac...

1041
01:10:59,968 --> 01:11:02,804
you are the most honest man I know.

1042
01:11:13,106 --> 01:11:14,525
You want to have dinner?

1043
01:11:16,026 --> 01:11:17,528
Very well, Doctor.

1044
01:11:40,843 --> 01:11:43,011
Grayson to Topa.

1045
01:11:45,973 --> 01:11:47,891
Yes, Commander?

1046
01:11:47,975 --> 01:11:49,976
We're about to leave orbit.

1047
01:11:50,060 --> 01:11:53,188
I was wondering if you'd like to sit
in the command chair for departure.

1048
01:11:54,565 --> 01:11:57,442
I... would like that, yes.

1049
01:11:57,526 --> 01:11:59,695
Report to the bridge on the double.

1050
01:12:00,112 --> 01:12:01,488
Yes, sir.
