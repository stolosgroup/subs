only by the amount of power available.

The Orville's quantum core was
sufficient to destroy all Kaylon vessels

Isaac and I discovered
their Achilles heel

111

by studying the Kaylon
the Orville found on Situla Four.

112
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:46,044
Every Kaylon and every one
of their ships is connected

113
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:47,671
through a synchronization matrix.

114
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:49,464
That's how they coordinate
all their actions,

115
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:51,216
even across light-years of space.

116
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:53,635
- And that's how you got inside
the Kaylon network?

117
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:56,305
Correct.
The device uses quantum energy

118
00:09:56,305 --> 00:09:58,932
to trigger a feedback loop
in its interlink chain.

119
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:01,643
- Basically, it turns the relays
into a row of dominoes.

120
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:03,812
Knock one down, they all go down.

121
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:06,440
After the initiation sequence
is transmitted,

122
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,108
it cannot be countermanded.

123
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:11,028
- And what about you?
Why weren't your systems damaged?

124
00:10:11,028 --> 00:10:14,531
- I am no longer connected
to the synchronization matrix.

125
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:17,034
- This is better than we ever
could've hoped for.

126
00:10:17,034 --> 00:10:20,204
Our priority now should be
to build a quantum core

127
00:10:20,204 --> 00:10:22,122
that can maximize the weapon's range

128
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:25,209
and eradicate the Kaylon
threat completely.

129
00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:28,086
- Yes, sir.
We can get to work on your order.

130
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:31,298
- Uh... Well, now wait a second,
with all due respect,

131
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:34,927
we're being very cavalier
about this, aren't we?

132
00:10:34,927 --> 00:10:39,306
I mean, you do realize what you're
talking about is... is genocide?

133
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:43,936
- Isaac was tasked with developing
a weapon that could defeat the Kaylon.

134
00:10:43,936 --> 00:10:46,021
He exceeded our expectations.

135
00:10:46,021 --> 00:10:47,731
We'd be fools not to use it.

136
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:50,192
- And is it really genocide

137
00:10:50,192 --> 00:10:55,280
if our only objective is to prevent them
from killing every other living species,

138
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,448
including us?

139
00:10:56,448 --> 00:10:59,952
- Admiral, we've seen first-hand
that the Kaylon

140
00:10:59,952 --> 00:11:02,412
are capable of change and growth.

141
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:04,206
Our experience with Timmis...

142
00:11:04,206 --> 00:11:08,460
- Yes, I read your report about the...
emotive Kaylon.

143
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,003
- It proves they can evolve.

144
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:11,547
- It proves nothing.

145
00:11:11,547 --> 00:11:13,966
That Kaylon didn't evolve on its own.

146
00:11:13,966 --> 00:11:16,218
It was modified by a cyberneticist.

147
00:11:16,218 --> 00:11:20,222
And correct me if I'm wrong,
but it didn't work with Isaac here.

148
00:11:20,222 --> 00:11:21,849
That is correct.

149
00:11:21,849 --> 00:11:25,310
My capacity to experience emotion
was only temporary.

150
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:29,731
- Captain Mercer, if you think
that we can enlist and train

151
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:34,111
an army of cyberneticists to teach empathy
to ten billion Kaylon,

152
00:11:34,111 --> 00:11:35,779
I'd love to hear your plan.

153
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:39,783
- Look, all I'm saying
is that we have created a weapon

154
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:42,160
of unparalleled destructive power.

155
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,540
And I just think that before we go
cracking eggshells with a sledgehammer,

156
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:49,668
we... need to consider
the moral implications.

157
00:11:49,668 --> 00:11:54,506
- I agree this is an unprecedented
situation with profound ethical questions.

158
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:58,260
But how we proceed
won't be decided in this room.

159
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,345
It's a matter for the Union Council.

160
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:03,640
Until they make a determination,
there's nothing more to say.

161
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:10,898

Why is that part
of the sky glowing green?

334
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:15,873
It is a phenomenon known
as the Aurora Borealis.

335
00:24:15,873 --> 00:24:19,501
When charged particles from the Sun
collide with the planet's atmosphere,

336
00:24:19,501 --> 00:24:23,213
the air molecules are
induced into a higher energy state.

347

the Kaylon when we had the chance.

- Captain, do you honestly think
they can ever be trusted?

352
00:25:34,826 --> 00:25:38,121
- I think we need to give
the armistice a chance.

353
00:25:40,165 --> 00:25:42,334
