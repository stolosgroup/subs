First off, the projection radius
of the field

greater than Dr. Aronov's original device.

161
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:41,535
- All ships!
We're taking heavy losses!

162
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:44,538
I'm ordering a full retreat,

163
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:46,790

164
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,876
We'll try to lose them in the Veil nebula.

165
00:11:48,876 --> 00:11:50,419
- Gordon!
- On it!

166
00:11:59,178 --> 00:12:00,888
- Tractor beam has locked on!

167
00:12:00,888 --> 00:12:02,181
- Full reverse power.

168
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:07,352
- No effect!

169
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:09,188

- Hailing!

170
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:11,899
You will surrender the device.

171
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:14,276
- Back off now
or we'll destroy it ourselves.

172
00:12:14,276 --> 00:12:16,945
- You will surrender the device
or you will die.

173
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:18,238
Prepare to be boarded.

174
00:12:18,739 --> 00:12:21,909
- Talla. Go to the lab.
Destroy the Aronov device.

175
00:12:23,869 --> 00:12:25,787
- Oh, god, hang onto something!

176
00:12:31,043 --> 00:12:33,545
- Talla!
- Medical team to the bridge!

177
00:12:33,545 --> 00:12:35,047
- Ed, I'll go.

178
00:12:35,047 --> 00:12:37,382
- Do it, go! Charly, take the helm.
- Aye, sir!

179

180

- Yeah, I'll be fine.

181
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:54,358
Captain, Kaylon vessel
is activating docking clamps.

182
00:12:54,358 --> 00:12:55,984

183
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:57,277
- Options!
- Sir.

184
00:12:57,277 --> 00:13:00,906
A forced overload of the deflector array
could disrupt their tractor beam.

185
00:13:00,906 --> 00:13:02,157
- Mercer to Lamarr!

186
00:13:02,157 --> 00:13:04,743
We're gonna use the quantum core
to overload the deflectors!

187
00:13:04,743 --> 00:13:05,827
On Isaac's command!

188
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:07,579

189

Core output 60%.

190
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:20,217
Core output 76%.

191
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:28,475

192
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:29,893
Core overloading.

193
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:43,365
- We're loose!
- Get us out of here!

194
00:14:05,846 --> 00:14:08,932
- Bortus to Captain.
Still no sign of the Kaylon.

195
00:14:08,932 --> 00:14:11,560
It is possible they have given up
their pursuit.

196
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,936
All right, keep me posted.

197
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:14,479
Mercer out.

198
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:19,276
- And it's not possible he was
injured during one of the blasts?

199
00:14:19,276 --> 00:14:20,944
On his way back to the bridge?

200
00:14:20,944 --> 00:14:22,154
- I've done a full scan.

201
00:14:22,154 --> 00:14:24,615
If he hit his head and took a fall
somewhere, I'd know about it.

202
00:14:24,615 --> 00:14:27,618
- Captain, these magnetic impedance
readings, they don't add up.

203
00:14:27,618 --> 00:14:28,869
- What do you mean?

204
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:32,122
- Well, the residual energy signature
makes it look like the Aronov device

205
00:14:32,122 --> 00:14:33,582
has been running at full power,

206
00:14:33,582 --> 00:14:35,375
but it hasn't been activated in days.

207
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,836
- Could there have been
some sort of overload?

208
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:40,672
- You mean could he have been
vaporized by a power surge?

209
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:41,965
No. No way.

210
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:44,092
The scans would pick up
any organic residue.

211
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:45,219
There's nothing.

212
00:14:45,219 --> 00:14:46,803
- Well then where the hell is he?

213
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:49,097
Bridge to Captain.

214
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:50,265
- Go ahead.

215
00:14:50,265 --> 00:14:53,060
We are... being hailed.

216
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,144
- By who?

217
00:14:54,144 --> 00:14:56,855
By... Lieutenant Malloy.

218
00:15:03,529 --> 00:15:05,280
- Where is it coming from?

219
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,991
The message appears
to have originated from Earth.

220
00:15:07,991 --> 00:15:11,453
However, it is encoded
on a sub-quantum carrier wave,

221
00:15:11,453 --> 00:15:14,873
calibrated to 3.7 times
the speed of light.

222
00:15:14,873 --> 00:15:18,126
At such a velocity,
its time of transmission would be...

223
00:15:18,836 --> 00:15:21,088
approximately 400 years ago.

224
00:15:23,298 --> 00:15:25,884
- So it was calculated to reach
the Veil nebula from Earth

225
00:15:25,884 --> 00:15:27,553
at exactly this point in time.

226
00:15:27,553 --> 00:15:28,679
Affirmative.

227
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:32,766
There is some degradation,
however the message is largely intact.

228
00:15:34,476 --> 00:15:36,728
Malloy to Orville.

229
00:15:36,728 --> 00:15:41,567
I'm sending this message to you
from... the year 2015.

230
00:15:42,901 --> 00:15:46,446
I've been here for six months,
and I'm...

231
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:48,323
...in case it reaches you.

232
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:53,495
I've encoded my temporal coordinates
within this message.

233
00:15:54,872 --> 00:15:57,207
Uh... I'm trapped here.

234
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,295
...if you can.

235
00:16:02,004 --> 00:16:06,884
I know it's a long shot,
but if you're able... send help.

236
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:09,845
I miss you guys.

237
00:16:10,846 --> 00:16:12,181
End transmission.

238
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:24,610
- Gordon Malloy.

239
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:27,779
Pilot and flight engineer
for a private charter airline.

240
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:32,409
Died in Pasadena, California,
July 12th, 2068.

241
00:16:32,409 --> 00:16:33,869
- How did this happen?

242
00:16:33,869 --> 00:16:35,746
- Well, we think we know,
because in fact,

243
00:16:35,746 --> 00:16:37,456
we've seen it before.

244
00:16:37,456 --> 00:16:39,166
As you will recall,

245
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:42,461
when Commander Grayson's younger self
was transported to our time,

246
00:16:42,461 --> 00:16:44,838
we were able to confirm
that human cognition

247
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:47,090
played a role
in the temporal displacement.

248
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:49,760
We think we're looking
at a similar explanation here.

249
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,887
The other night at the party,
Charly was asking Gordon

250
00:16:51,887 --> 00:16:53,889
about the cellular phone in his quarters.

251
00:16:53,889 --> 00:16:55,349
Got him talking about Laura.

252
00:16:55,349 --> 00:16:57,434
Now, we're still
just beginning to understand

253
00:16:57,434 --> 00:17:00,479
the relationship between temporal theory
and observer perception,

254
00:17:00,479 --> 00:17:03,482
but the short of it is,
Gordon was close to the Aronov device

255
00:17:03,482 --> 00:17:05,108
when we overloaded the deflectors.

256
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:07,152
The burst of energy
from the quantum drive

257
00:17:07,152 --> 00:17:09,238
amplified the temporal field
before it collapsed,

258
00:17:09,238 --> 00:17:11,782
and he got caught
in the displacement wave.

259
00:17:11,782 --> 00:17:13,825
I might be off base, but my bet

260
00:17:13,825 --> 00:17:17,788
is that his subconscious
picked that destination point:

261
00:17:17,788 --> 00:17:19,289
the early 21st century.

262
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:22,125
- So he's... trapped in the past?

263
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:23,836
- He was.

264
00:17:23,836 --> 00:17:27,339
According to these records,
he lived and died back there.

265
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:29,508
- So... if that's the case,

266
00:17:29,508 --> 00:17:31,552
it must mean we weren't able to save him.

267
00:17:31,552 --> 00:17:34,763
- She is correct.
We have already failed.

268
00:17:34,763 --> 00:17:35,931
- Not necessarily.

269
00:17:35,931 --> 00:17:38,350
See, that's where
temporal mechanics gets muddy.

270
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:39,685
It's all in flux.

271
00:17:39,685 --> 00:17:42,354
Our behavior is, as yet, a variable.

272
00:17:42,354 --> 00:17:45,983
Until and if we make the attempt
to rescue Lt. Malloy,

273
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:49,987
we are existing in a superposition
of several possible timelines.

274
00:17:49,987 --> 00:17:51,572
- Then he can be rescued.

275
00:17:51,572 --> 00:17:54,575
- But... why is there any record
of him at all?

276
00:17:54,575 --> 00:17:55,826
He knows the law.

277
00:17:55,826 --> 00:17:59,454
If you find yourself displaced in time,
you make yourself as invisible as you can.

278
00:17:59,454 --> 00:18:01,498
You do everything
in your power not to interfere.

279
00:18:01,498 --> 00:18:03,625
- Now that, I can't answer.

280
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:07,379
- Is it possible for us to go back
and get him?

281
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:10,507
- With the upgrades to the Aronov device

282
00:18:10,507 --> 00:18:12,885
and the temporal coordinates
Gordon sent us in the message,

283
00:18:12,885 --> 00:18:14,052
we got a shot.

284
00:18:14,052 --> 00:18:17,139
But it's gonna put a hell of a strain
on the quantum drive.

285
00:18:19,016 --> 00:18:23,478
- He's calling out to us from the past,
asking for our help.

286
00:18:24,313 --> 00:18:26,732
- And temporal law compels us to try.

Captain, in the early 22nd century,

346
00:21:50,769 --> 00:21:54,064
deposits of dysonium were
discovered inside Earth's mantle.

347
00:21:54,064 --> 00:21:57,401
However, at this current point in time,
they remain untouched.

348
00:21:57,401 --> 00:22:00,696

on your engineering team who's up to it?

Commander Lamarr is correct.

I am able to direct a geodetic probe
with greater precision than a biological.

365
00:22:37,399 --> 00:22:40,569
However, its course will need
to be plotted in real time

- Damn. That's straight bourbon, honey.

483

- Yeah, and I'm from Texas.

no, this is my...

brother.

489
00:32:44,006 --> 00:32:46,550
- I'm Sam. This is RJ.

490
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:49,136
- I'm Charly, this is Isaac.

491
00:32:49,136 --> 00:32:50,721
- A pleasure to meet you.

492
00:32:50,721 --> 00:32:52,681
What are some of your hobbies?

493
00:32:53,765 --> 00:32:57,436
- So listen, you, uh...
you got a couple bikes out there?

494
00:32:57,436 --> 00:32:59,229
- Two Screamin' Eagle V-Rods.

495
00:32:59,229 --> 00:33:01,148
- Ooh, yeah, those are beauties.

496
00:33:02,065 --> 00:33:07,237
I, um, don't suppose you'd let us
borrow them for a few hours?

497
00:33:10,199 --> 00:33:12,534
- Your sister's got some big ol' balls
on her, doesn't she?

498
00:33:12,534 --> 00:33:15,954
- Negative. Her anatomical construct
is comprised of...

499
00:33:15,954 --> 00:33:21,627
- So tell me...
who's the strongest guy in here?

500
00:33:23,295 --> 00:33:26,632
- That would probably be, uh... me.

501
00:33:26,632 --> 00:33:29,968
- He's fulla shit. It's Richie over there.

502
00:33:32,346 --> 00:33:33,931
- Okay. How about this:

503
00:33:33,931 --> 00:33:38,477
If my brother here can beat Richie
in an arm-wrestling match,

504
00:33:39,269 --> 00:33:40,854
you give us your bikes.

505
00:33:44,024 --> 00:33:46,193
- Are you kiddin' me?
- Is it a bet?

506
00:33:46,193 --> 00:33:48,445
- Well, what do we get if you lose?

507
00:33:48,445 --> 00:33:50,155
- I lose...

508
00:33:51,156 --> 00:33:52,991

00:34:13,136 --> 00:34:14,513
- Understood, Ensign.

516
00:34:14,513 --> 00:34:16,974
- Don't call me... never mind.

517
00:34:16,974 --> 00:34:18,183
Okay.

518
00:34:18,183 --> 00:34:19,685
On my mark.

519
00:34:21,478 --> 00:34:23,188
Aaannnd...

520
00:34:23,188 --> 00:34:25,190
Go!

521
00:34:44,376 --> 00:34:46,962
- Oh, no, I am losing.

522
00:35:05,689 --> 00:35:08,525
Ohh!

523
00:35:08,525 --> 00:35:11,862
- It would appear
this is not one of your hobbies.

524
00:35:16,909 --> 00:35:18,785
- Better luck next time.

525
00:35:18,785 --> 00:35:20,787
♪

526
00:35:36,887 --> 00:35:40,807
- So, I was singing at this little pub
back in New York,

527
00:35:40,807 --> 00:35:45,479
and one night this awkward
kind of dorky guy walks in...

528
00:35:45,479 --> 00:35:47,439
- Oh, come on!
- And...

529
00:35:47,439 --> 00:35:50,984
And he's all alone,
and he's clapping louder than anyone,

530
00:35:50,984 --> 00:35:52,819
so obviously you know
what my first thought is,

531
00:35:52,819 --> 00:35:55,489
weirdo loner, creepy guy...

532
00:35:55,489 --> 00:35:58,033
...who's probably gonna ask
if he can buy me a drink.

533
00:35:58,033 --> 00:36:00,285
- Which of course I do.
- Which of course he does.

534
00:36:00,285 --> 00:36:01,495
And so I'm like...

535
00:36:01,495 --> 00:36:03,747
- Dad, can I have some more juice?

536
00:36:03,747 --> 00:36:05,415
- Of course you can, pal.
Do you want my help?

537
00:36:05,415 --> 00:36:06,583
- No, I got it.

538
00:36:06,583 --> 00:36:08,001
- Okay.

539
00:36:08,001 --> 00:36:10,420
So, I'm like, you know,
ten seconds away

540
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:12,881
from blowing him off
and walking to my car,

541
00:36:12,881 --> 00:36:16,552
and then he starts talking
to me about my music.

542
00:36:16,552 --> 00:36:18,720
And...

543
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,640
it was so immediately clear that he...

544
00:36:22,224 --> 00:36:23,600
got it.

545
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,812
You know, he was really hearing
what I was trying to do up there

546
00:36:26,812 --> 00:36:31,149
and understood why it was
the most important thing in my life.

547
00:36:32,526 --> 00:36:34,570
You know, a lot of guys
had come to my shows

548
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:37,990
and thrown out compliments
trying to score, but with him...

549
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:39,741
- I had no intention
of having sex with her.

550
00:36:39,741 --> 00:36:41,326
I thought she was ugly, really.

551
00:36:41,326 --> 00:36:43,871
- Stop. Let me finish.
- Okay.

552
00:36:43,871 --> 00:36:46,957
- He just really cared
about getting to know me.

553
00:36:46,957 --> 00:36:49,209
You know, and so I thought,

554
00:36:49,209 --> 00:36:53,172
hey, not my usual type, but...

555
00:36:53,172 --> 00:36:56,091
what the hell, give it a shot.

556
00:36:56,842 --> 00:36:59,386
I had just broken up with this guy Greg,

557
00:36:59,386 --> 00:37:02,514
and the last thing that I wanted was
another douchebag...

558
00:37:02,514 --> 00:37:05,434
- But she went out with me anyway.
- That's right, yeah.

559
00:37:05,434 --> 00:37:08,103
Look at us. Seven years later,
that douchebag is my husband.

560
00:37:08,103 --> 00:37:09,771
I'm her douchebag.

561
00:37:11,064 --> 00:37:15,110
- Well, this is a very delicious lunch.
Thank you.

562
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:16,278
- Sure.

563
00:37:16,278 --> 00:37:18,655
So, how long have you been in aviation?

564
00:37:18,655 --> 00:37:20,365
- Five years.
- Ten years.

565
00:37:20,365 --> 00:37:22,576
- Seems like five, doesn't it?
- It does.

566
00:37:22,576 --> 00:37:24,161
- That's why I said five
'cause it seems like it.

567
00:37:24,161 --> 00:37:25,245
- But yeah, ten years.

568
00:37:26,205 --> 00:37:29,875
- And Gordon tells me that
you work out of the Boston area.

569
00:37:29,875 --> 00:37:31,335
You must be Sox fans.

570
00:37:35,214 --> 00:37:39,134
- Yeah, yeah, I mean,
it gets cold out there,

571
00:37:39,134 --> 00:37:41,053
so socks are, um...

572
00:37:43,972 --> 00:37:45,516
- Socks are important.

573
00:38:04,868 --> 00:38:07,538
- Hey. Bortus is asking
for a shipwide status report.

574
00:38:07,538 --> 00:38:10,040
How we doing down here?
- Uh, slow but steady.

575
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,834
Would you hand me
that phase modulator?

576
00:38:14,586 --> 00:38:16,255
- You think we're gonna be able
to make it home?

577
00:38:16,797 --> 00:38:19,216
- Well, Orville's a tough ship.

578
00:38:19,216 --> 00:38:22,261
If Isaac and Charly
get the dysonium, she'll make it.

579
00:38:24,555 --> 00:38:26,473
What's wrong?

580
00:38:26,473 --> 00:38:29,351
- I tweaked a muscle in my upper back.
Acts up sometimes.

581
00:38:29,351 --> 00:38:31,687
I've been meaning to see Dr. Finn,
I've just been so busy.

582
00:38:31,687 --> 00:38:33,522
- Where?
- Right shoulder?

583
00:38:33,522 --> 00:38:35,148
- Want me to see if I can get at it?

584
00:38:35,148 --> 00:38:37,025
- That's very nice, but I've tried.

585
00:38:37,025 --> 00:38:38,777
- With a Xelayan?

586
00:38:39,444 --> 00:38:40,529
- Well, no.

587
00:38:42,573 --> 00:38:44,658
Okay, take a stab at it.

588
00:38:47,536 --> 00:38:48,829
Holy shit.

589
00:38:48,829 --> 00:38:50,497
- Hang on, I feel it.

590
00:38:50,497 --> 00:38:51,874
- Oh, my god...

591
00:38:51,874 --> 00:38:54,001
Oh, my god.

592
00:38:54,001 --> 00:38:55,460
Ahh!

593
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:56,670
- Yep.
- Ahh!

594
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:59,673
- Sorry, did that hurt?
- No. No, no. Keep going, keep going.

595
00:39:01,592 --> 00:39:03,385
Wow, how long you known how to do this?

596
00:39:03,385 --> 00:39:05,095
- I don't know how to do this.

597
00:39:05,095 --> 00:39:06,722
- Ahh! Whoo!

598
00:39:06,722 --> 00:39:08,515
Yep.

599
00:39:09,933 --> 00:39:14,062
Ahh! It's like a 50 G-force,
completely focused and controlled.

600
00:39:14,062 --> 00:39:15,981
Oh, my god!

601
00:39:15,981 --> 00:39:17,733
Ahh, you gotta be kidding me
with this shit.

602
00:39:17,733 --> 00:39:19,151
- Yep, there it is.

603
00:39:19,776 --> 00:39:21,069
Got it.

604
00:39:23,363 --> 00:39:24,698
Better?

605
00:39:51,517 --> 00:39:53,143
- Can we talk now?

606
00:39:53,936 --> 00:39:56,063
- Yeah. We can talk.

607
00:39:56,063 --> 00:40:00,067
- Look, I understand
that you got a raw deal, I really do.

608
00:40:00,692 --> 00:40:03,278
But I want to hear a goddamn
good explanation for what's happening,

609
00:40:03,278 --> 00:40:04,863
because the way I see it,

610
00:40:04,863 --> 00:40:06,907
we oughta haul your ass
back to the ship right now

611
00:40:06,907 --> 00:40:07,908
and throw you in the brig.

612
00:40:07,908 --> 00:40:10,327
- Shut up.
- Excuse me, Lieutenant?

613
00:40:10,327 --> 00:40:12,996
- No. No, I'm not your lieutenant.

614
00:40:12,996 --> 00:40:15,457
I'm not your helmsman, I'm not your crew.

615
00:40:15,457 --> 00:40:17,835
I'm Gordon Malloy,
and this is my house.

616
00:40:17,835 --> 00:40:21,463
- Gordon. You're guilty of about
50 counts of temporal contamination.

617
00:40:21,463 --> 00:40:23,465
- You broke the law, and god knows
what the consequences...

618
00:40:23,465 --> 00:40:25,175
- Screw the law!

619
00:40:26,635 --> 00:40:29,513
I spent three years obeying the law.

620
00:40:30,055 --> 00:40:33,433
I hid in an abandoned cabin
in the woods of Connecticut

621
00:40:33,433 --> 00:40:35,602
and I did my goddamn duty.

622
00:40:35,602 --> 00:40:39,398
I stayed invisible.
I didn't see anyone, I didn't go anywhere.

623
00:40:40,274 --> 00:40:41,984
You know what I ate?

624
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:43,485
Animals. Yeah.

625
00:40:44,069 --> 00:40:48,532
I was holding my weapon when I got
sent back, and I used it to kill animals.

626
00:40:48,532 --> 00:40:50,868
You wanna talk
about breaking the law?

627
00:40:50,868 --> 00:40:53,537
Here it's no big deal, but in our time?

628
00:40:53,537 --> 00:40:55,205
I'm a serial murderer, folks.

629
00:40:55,914 --> 00:40:58,125
You know what that does to your head?

630
00:40:58,125 --> 00:41:00,961
So after three years,
I said the hell with it.

631
00:41:00,961 --> 00:41:02,838
Temporal law can blow me.

632
00:41:02,838 --> 00:41:04,631
Yeah, looks fine on paper,

633
00:41:04,631 --> 00:41:08,594
but the Union has no idea
what it's like to be trapped, no idea.

634
00:41:11,096 --> 00:41:14,141
So... so I went looking for her.

635
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:18,020
And I found her.
And I made a life for myself.

636
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:21,857
And I will not let you
make me feel like shit for doing it.

637
00:41:22,357 --> 00:41:24,651
I'm a human being.
We're social creatures.

638
00:41:24,651 --> 00:41:26,361
Without each other, we die.

639
00:41:27,738 --> 00:41:29,698
Was I supposed to die?

640
00:41:29,698 --> 00:41:32,409
- To protect the timeline? Yes.

641
00:41:33,035 --> 00:41:35,829
- Maybe this is how
it's supposed to be! Who's to say?

642
00:41:35,829 --> 00:41:38,707
Who's to say I shouldn't be able
to do whatever I want?

643
00:41:38,707 --> 00:41:41,877
- Oh. Seems you really have
acclimated to this century.

644
00:41:42,753 --> 00:41:45,797
- When you joined the fleet,
you took an oath to the Union.

645
00:41:45,797 --> 00:41:47,049
- You're here.

646
00:41:47,049 --> 00:41:50,093
You're here. Which means
the Union still exists in the future.

647
00:41:50,093 --> 00:41:52,513
If anything was gonna happen,
it already happened.

648
00:41:52,513 --> 00:41:54,431
- That's how the physics works. No.
- No.

649
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:56,767
- The timeline is okay.
- You're deluding yourself.

650
00:41:56,767 --> 00:41:58,936
Nobody really understands time travel.

651
00:41:58,936 --> 00:42:01,355
According to Isaac,
it's all still in flux.

652
00:42:01,355 --> 00:42:03,649
He says observer interaction
is still a variable,

653
00:42:03,649 --> 00:42:07,945
and until we act one way or the other,
all timelines are possible.

654
00:42:07,945 --> 00:42:10,531
- How do you know that your son
won't grow up to start a war

655
00:42:10,531 --> 00:42:13,075
that could delay
or even prevent Union emergence?

656
00:42:13,075 --> 00:42:16,954
- Or maybe, maybe one of his descendants
helps create it.

657
00:42:16,954 --> 00:42:19,248
Or maybe even gives birth to you.

658
00:42:19,248 --> 00:42:20,624
Or to me.

659
00:42:20,624 --> 00:42:24,169
- That's my point. Gordon,
without knowing, we can't interfere.

660
00:42:24,169 --> 00:42:26,463
We don't have the wisdom,
we don't have the foresight.

661
00:42:26,463 --> 00:42:29,174
You may have done irreparable damage
already, we don't know.

662
00:42:29,174 --> 00:42:31,301
But the longer you're here,
the greater the risk.

663
00:42:31,301 --> 00:42:32,636
According to Isaac, we're existi...

664
00:42:32,636 --> 00:42:35,138
- Oh, yeah, and Isaac's
always been trustworthy, hasn't he?

665
00:42:35,138 --> 00:42:37,432
- Oh, Jesus, Gordon, come on...
- What?

666
00:42:37,432 --> 00:42:40,060
What? He helped the Kaylon
kill thousands of people.

667
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:41,728
That we know for sure.

668
00:42:41,728 --> 00:42:45,274
So a verifiable crime is less serious
than a hypothetical one?

669
00:42:45,274 --> 00:42:46,859
Nice priorities.

670
00:42:52,072 --> 00:42:54,032
- You have to come with us.

671
00:42:56,910 --> 00:42:57,953
- Forget it.

672
00:42:58,453 --> 00:43:02,583
- You sent that message.
You wanted us to come take you home.

673
00:43:02,583 --> 00:43:03,542
We're here.

674
00:43:03,542 --> 00:43:06,170
- Ten years ago I wanted it!

675
00:43:08,255 --> 00:43:10,465
More than anything in the galaxy.

676
00:43:11,758 --> 00:43:12,926
But not now.

677
00:43:15,095 --> 00:43:16,638
You took too long.

678
00:43:18,307 --> 00:43:19,725
And I'm happy here.

Somehow I think I've always known.

There's just something
about you that's...

693
00:44:42,266 --> 00:44:43,559
different.

694

It's this energy that surrounds you.

Even when the pandemic came...

698
00:45:01,159 --> 00:45:02,494
you knew.

699

When everything around us seemed
like it was falling apart...

700
00:45:07,791 --> 00:45:10,377
you told me it was gonna be okay.

About us?

lying to me our entire life?

Hi. I'm Nancy Weber.
This is my listing.

731
00:47:07,744 --> 00:47:10,247
- Hi.
- Are you interested in the house?

732
00:47:10,247 --> 00:47:12,165
- We, um...

00:47:12,165 --> 00:47:13,375
Yes.

Yeah, we're... we're interested.

looking to buy their first home.

The house, I mean.

Although the guy is pretty cute too.

739
00:47:27,848 --> 00:47:29,725

740
00:47:29,725 --> 00:47:30,642
- Come on in.

741
00:47:30,642 --> 00:47:32,436
You going for a hike?

742
00:47:32,436 --> 00:47:35,022

- The backpack.

Yes. We are. This afternoon.

746
00:47:43,530 --> 00:47:45,115
Right, honey?

747
00:47:45,115 --> 00:47:48,619
- Affirmative. Our pairing
has flourished for some time.

748
00:47:48,619 --> 00:47:51,038
- Well, this is the main living area.

749
00:47:51,038 --> 00:47:55,375
Plenty of room for just the two of you,
or if you're looking to start a family.

750
00:47:55,375 --> 00:47:57,336
I'm assuming you don't have kids yet?

751
00:47:57,336 --> 00:48:00,297

Insemination has yet to occur.

753

- Could we see it?

756
00:48:06,929 --> 00:48:08,222
- Of course.

757
00:48:08,222 --> 00:48:11,892
The previous owners
used this primarily for storage,

758
00:48:11,892 --> 00:48:14,770
but with a little work,
it's a perfect space

759

or even a small home gym.

and the price is fair.

Could we have a moment alone
to discuss it between ourselves?

762

- Absolutely. Take your time.

And I really think
you're gonna love it, trust me.

of the Earth.

767
00:48:45,425 --> 00:48:49,012
Once the device is active, we will need
to continuously adjust the trajectory

768
00:48:49,012 --> 00:48:51,473
in order to avoid
petrological disequilibrium.

769

770
00:48:53,809 --> 00:48:55,227

771

- All right, let's fire it up.

772

to bearing 0-0-7 for eight seconds, now.

776
00:49:21,712 --> 00:49:23,422
- Rotating vector.

777
00:49:30,971 --> 00:49:33,724
A pressure gradient is shifting
in a nearby aquifer.

778
00:49:33,724 --> 00:49:35,684
- Pull back 20 meters
and redirect laterally.

779
00:49:35,684 --> 00:49:37,394
- Acknowledged.

780
00:49:43,567 --> 00:49:47,029
The gradient has stabilized.
Tectonic stress is nominal.

781
00:49:47,029 --> 00:49:50,199
- Redirect, bearing 0-1-1 mark 12.

782
00:49:54,536 --> 00:49:56,538
- Density transition confirmed.

783
00:49:56,538 --> 00:49:58,373
We have breached the mantle.

784
00:49:59,541 --> 00:50:01,793
- Okay. Now we wait.

785
00:50:08,717 --> 00:50:10,302
- I like your hair.

786
00:50:10,302 --> 00:50:12,221
- Okay, what the hell are you doing?

787
00:50:12,221 --> 00:50:13,597
- Please clarify.

788
00:50:13,597 --> 00:50:15,641
- You've been asking
all these random questions,

789
00:50:15,641 --> 00:50:17,768
like, "What music do you like,
what sports do you play?"

790
00:50:17,768 --> 00:50:20,562
You're acting totally weird.
What's going on?

791
00:50:20,562 --> 00:50:23,398
- I am attempting to initiate
a conversation with you.

792
00:50:23,398 --> 00:50:26,151
- Why? If you have something
to say, just say it.

793
00:50:26,151 --> 00:50:28,195
Don't dick around
with all this small talk.

794
00:50:28,195 --> 00:50:29,530
- Very well.

795
00:50:29,530 --> 00:50:32,282
During my observations
of biological customs,

796
00:50:32,282 --> 00:50:35,244
I have seen many instances

performs a service for another.

798
00:50:37,996 --> 00:50:41,500
The humans call it a "thank you."

799
00:50:42,042 --> 00:50:43,168
- Yeah?

800
00:50:43,919 --> 00:50:45,796
- I never said "thank you."

801
00:50:45,796 --> 00:50:47,589
For my reactivation.

802
00:50:48,924 --> 00:50:50,175
- Oh.

803
00:50:50,175 --> 00:50:52,761
- In effect, you saved my life.

804
00:50:54,555 --> 00:50:56,473
- Yep. Sure. I guess I did.

805
00:51:02,479 --> 00:51:03,814
- Thank you.

806
00:51:08,110 --> 00:51:11,196
The appropriate response is,
"You are welcome."

807
00:51:11,196 --> 00:51:13,323
- Yeah, well, let's skip that part.

808
00:51:14,867 --> 00:51:16,493
- I do not understand.

809
00:51:16,493 --> 00:51:19,288
Do you not wish to avail yourself
of my thanks?

810
00:51:19,288 --> 00:51:21,081
- Isaac, I was doing my duty.

811
00:51:21,081 --> 00:51:23,375
And I can promise you,
I didn't like it one bit.

812
00:51:23,375 --> 00:51:27,671
I was separating my job
from my personal feelings, that's all.

813
00:51:27,671 --> 00:51:29,089
- I see.

814
00:51:29,089 --> 00:51:32,009
You still harbor negative
sentiments toward me.

815
00:51:32,009 --> 00:51:35,220
- We have to work together. Every day.

816
00:51:35,846 --> 00:51:40,017
But that doesn't change what you did,
and who I lost because of it.

817
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:49,484
Does your machine brain
have any concept of what love is?

818
00:51:50,027 --> 00:51:51,695
- I do not understand.

819
00:51:52,446 --> 00:51:54,364
- Well, I'll help you.

820
00:51:54,364 --> 00:51:57,159
Amanda wasn't just my best friend.

821
00:51:57,159 --> 00:51:58,577
I loved her.

822
00:52:00,579 --> 00:52:02,831
And I never got to say it to her.

823
00:52:04,917 --> 00:52:08,795
She was someone I could've seen
spending the rest of my life with.

824
00:52:11,298 --> 00:52:13,884
And I have no idea if she felt
the same way.

825
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:16,261
I waited too long to ask.

826
00:52:16,261 --> 00:52:17,513
And then she was gone.

827
00:52:17,513 --> 00:52:21,308
You took her life,
and by doing that, you took mine.

828
00:52:23,185 --> 00:52:24,937
Or what mine could've been.

829
00:52:26,939 --> 00:52:31,485
So yeah.
I still harbor "negative sentiments."

830
00:52:32,945 --> 00:52:35,739
- Nonetheless... I thank you.

831
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:49,378
- Extraction complete.

832
00:52:51,255 --> 00:52:53,549
- The plasma drill has been deactivated.

833
00:52:53,549 --> 00:52:55,551
- Okay. Let's seal it up, quick.

834
00:53:04,810 --> 00:53:06,353
Let's get outta here.

835
00:53:07,938 --> 00:53:09,439
- So, what do you say? Is it home?

836
00:53:09,439 --> 00:53:11,108
- We just broke up.

837
00:53:20,576 --> 00:53:23,620
- What did you think the words
"pay per view" meant?

838
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:24,788
- I never thought about it.

839
00:53:24,788 --> 00:53:26,707
I thought it was
like some foreign expression

840
00:53:26,707 --> 00:53:28,917
like "a la carte" or "in escrow."

841
00:53:30,544 --> 00:53:32,629
- Well, it is not.
- Oh, man!

842
00:53:34,339 --> 00:53:36,592
Ah, so, what's your good news?

843
00:53:36,592 --> 00:53:38,510
Oh, I got fired.

844
00:53:40,304 --> 00:53:41,722
Jack!

845
00:53:50,606 --> 00:53:51,607
- No.

846
00:53:53,483 --> 00:53:54,359
No.

847
00:53:55,694 --> 00:53:57,029
Whatever you think you're gonna do,

848
00:53:57,029 --> 00:53:59,281
you can forget it
and get the hell out of here.

849
00:53:59,281 --> 00:54:00,949
- Gordon...
- I said get out!

850
00:54:00,949 --> 00:54:02,868
- Gordon, what's going on?

851
00:54:04,161 --> 00:54:07,331
- They're here to take me away.
- What?

852
00:54:07,331 --> 00:54:09,708
- You can't stay here, and you know it.

853
00:54:09,708 --> 00:54:12,211
- Then you should've gotten
your goddamn dates right

854
00:54:12,211 --> 00:54:13,545
and shown up ten years ago!

855
00:54:13,545 --> 00:54:16,048
I'm not leaving!
- You don't have a choice.

856
00:54:16,882 --> 00:54:20,010
- What... you're gonna
haul me outta here by force?

857
00:54:20,010 --> 00:54:21,678
- If I have to.

858
00:54:22,930 --> 00:54:23,931
- Okay.

859
00:54:25,182 --> 00:54:27,935
All right. I'll go.

860
00:54:30,479 --> 00:54:31,980
We all will.

861
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:34,483
- I'm sorry, Gordon. No.

862
00:54:34,483 --> 00:54:36,735
- I'm not leaving here without my family.

863
00:54:41,031 --> 00:54:43,283
- Daddy, what's wrong?

864
00:54:43,283 --> 00:54:44,952
- It's okay, honey.

865
00:54:44,952 --> 00:54:46,411
- What, are you gonna kill us?

866
00:54:46,411 --> 00:54:49,122
- No. Just a heavy stun.

867
00:54:49,706 --> 00:54:52,543
And when you wake up, we'll be gone.

868
00:54:52,543 --> 00:54:55,838
And we will disappear
so deep into this world

869
00:54:55,838 --> 00:54:58,966
that you won't have a prayer
of finding us again, ever.

870
00:54:58,966 --> 00:55:01,385
So you have two choices:
the door or the floor.

871
00:55:01,385 --> 00:55:02,386
Take your pick.

872
00:55:02,386 --> 00:55:04,346
- Gordon, you know
what you're doing is...

873
00:55:04,346 --> 00:55:06,306
Isaac to Captain Mercer.

874
00:55:06,306 --> 00:55:07,766
Go ahead.

875
00:55:07,766 --> 00:55:11,186
We have secured the dysonium,
and we are returning to the shuttle.

876
00:55:11,186 --> 00:55:14,147
- Acknowledged. Mercer out.

877
00:55:20,696 --> 00:55:24,032
All right. We're bringing you home.

878
00:55:24,032 --> 00:55:26,368
- I don't think you heard me.
I told you I am not...

879
00:55:26,368 --> 00:55:27,995
- From 2015.

880
00:55:29,288 --> 00:55:30,664
- What...?

881
00:55:30,664 --> 00:55:35,043
Farther back down the timeline,
you're there, asking for our help.

882
00:55:35,043 --> 00:55:37,171
It's a ten-year jump. We'll make it.

883
00:55:37,171 --> 00:55:40,007
- No. No, no, no, you can't.

884
00:55:40,007 --> 00:55:41,800
- Gordon, what does he mean?

885
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:45,220
- He means... going back for me.

886
00:55:45,846 --> 00:55:47,306
Ten years in the past.

887
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:50,517
- What?

888
00:55:51,643 --> 00:55:53,812
- No, what about...
- Us?

889
00:55:53,812 --> 00:55:55,314
There won't be any us.

890
00:55:56,190 --> 00:55:58,859
No us, no Edward.

891
00:55:58,859 --> 00:56:00,319
No baby.

892
00:56:00,944 --> 00:56:02,487
- What kind of people are you?

893
00:56:02,487 --> 00:56:06,783
- I'm so sorry. But this reality
was never supposed to exist.

894
00:56:06,783 --> 00:56:10,787
- Our reality? My son's? My baby's?

895
00:56:12,581 --> 00:56:14,875
You're saying they won't exist?

896
00:56:15,667 --> 00:56:16,710
- I...

897
00:56:17,419 --> 00:56:18,670
I don't know.

898
00:56:18,670 --> 00:56:23,217
- That's the reason it's illegal
and immoral to play god with history.

899
00:56:23,217 --> 00:56:25,052
- Who's playing god? Huh?

900
00:56:25,052 --> 00:56:27,763
The only one playing god here is you.

901
00:56:27,763 --> 00:56:30,390
Is it illegal to erase people
from existence?

902

Because I call that murder.

903

Can't just fly into the future without it.

We need the Aronov device
to travel to the past, yeah?

968
01:02:22,117 --> 01:02:25,495
But if we wanna travel to the future,
we got a built-in method right here.

969
01:02:25,495 --> 01:02:26,788
We've had it the entire time.

970

971
01:02:27,706 --> 01:02:29,541
- Whenever we're using
the quantum drive,

972
01:02:29,541 --> 01:02:30,918
we're moving faster than light.

973
01:02:30,918 --> 01:02:33,504
But the quantum field creates
a bubble around the ship,

974
01:02:33,504 --> 01:02:36,089
isolating us from the normal
spacetime continuum.

975
01:02:36,089 --> 01:02:39,593
Otherwise, we'd be subject
to Einsteinian relativity: time dilation.

976
01:02:39,593 --> 01:02:43,180
The closer we get to the speed of light,
the faster time passes outside the ship.

Well, don't you see?

978
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:48,727
We just shut down the field.

01:02:48,727 --> 01:02:51,688
The very thing it's supposed to prevent,
we just allow to happen.

980
01:02:51,688 --> 01:02:54,107
We push the ship as close as we can
to the speed of light

981
01:02:54,107 --> 01:02:55,984
and let Einstein take care of the rest.

01:02:55,984 --> 01:02:57,861
Without the field in place,

983
01:02:57,861 --> 01:03:00,656
such a speed would put the Orville
at high risk of collision.

984

Even a particle of interstellar dust
could compromise the hull.
