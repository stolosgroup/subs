Who are the real-world Illuminati ?

3
00:00:33,081 --> 00:00:35,751
- I am sorry to be late.

4
00:00:35,751 --> 00:00:38,629
- No worries. Here.
Your Opsadda.

5
00:00:38,629 --> 00:00:39,713
- Thank you.

6
00:00:53,978 --> 00:00:55,145
- Everything all right?

7
00:00:55,145 --> 00:00:59,733
- There are days when I would rather
confront a fleet of Krill battle cruisers

8
00:00:59,733 --> 00:01:01,318
than parent a child.

9
00:01:01,986 --> 00:01:02,987
- What's going on?

10
00:01:04,738 --> 00:01:08,158
- I believe Topa
is infatuated with a male.

11
00:01:08,158 --> 00:01:10,828
- Ahh, she's got a crush on a boy.

12
00:01:10,828 --> 00:01:11,996
- Yes.

13
00:01:11,996 --> 00:01:15,749
I have questioned her, but she refuses
to discuss the details of the matter.

14
00:01:15,749 --> 00:01:20,046
She frequently locks herself in her room
and does not emerge for hours.

15
00:01:20,046 --> 00:01:22,548
- Girls can be shy
about this kind of thing, Bortus,

16
00:01:22,548 --> 00:01:23,966
especially with their fathers.

17
00:01:23,966 --> 00:01:25,676
- Why?

18
00:01:25,676 --> 00:01:28,387
- Well, it can feel
a little embarrassing at times.

19
00:01:28,387 --> 00:01:29,722
Or at least very personal.

20
00:01:30,389 --> 00:01:35,978
- Klyden was more adept at speaking
with Topa regarding personal matters.

21
00:01:35,978 --> 00:01:38,856
It has been difficult
now that he is gone.

22
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:42,401
- Maybe Topa would be more comfortable
talking with another female.

23
00:01:42,401 --> 00:01:45,111
- Then you will speak to her.
Thank you.

24
00:01:45,988 --> 00:01:47,489
- Wait, wait, wait, hold on!

25
00:01:48,281 --> 00:01:49,449
Me?

26
00:01:50,076 --> 00:01:53,328
- Topa holds you
in the highest regard, Commander.

27
00:01:53,328 --> 00:01:55,622
She considers you a mentor.

28
00:01:57,416 --> 00:01:59,125
- I'll see what I can do.

29
00:02:12,305 --> 00:02:14,016
- Not now, Papa!

30
00:02:16,476 --> 00:02:18,520
What?

31
00:02:21,356 --> 00:02:22,441
Commander Grayson.

32
00:02:22,441 --> 00:02:24,401
- It's okay, you don't have to get up.

33
00:02:25,402 --> 00:02:26,570
Can I come in?

34
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:28,655
- Yes, of course.

35
00:02:30,074 --> 00:02:32,367
- I'm running a new
tactical simulation tomorrow.

36
00:02:32,367 --> 00:02:33,619
Atmospheric Combat.

37
00:02:33,619 --> 00:02:35,662
And I thought you might like
to come along,

38
00:02:35,662 --> 00:02:37,247
maybe even make a jump or two.

39
00:02:38,124 --> 00:02:41,919
- That... would be very exciting, sir.
Thank you.

40
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:45,213
- Simulator two, 1800 hours.
- I will be there.

41
00:02:53,097 --> 00:02:55,474
- You know, Topa...

42
00:02:56,683 --> 00:02:59,061
it's been a really
overwhelming year for you.

43
00:02:59,812 --> 00:03:02,481
And you have handled it all

44
00:03:02,481 --> 00:03:05,692
with a poise and a hardiness

45
00:03:05,692 --> 00:03:08,361
that some people
twice your age wouldn't.

46
00:03:09,446 --> 00:03:12,074
But I want you to know...

47
00:03:12,074 --> 00:03:14,118
you don't have to do it alone.

48
00:03:15,243 --> 00:03:18,497
You can always talk to me
about anything that's on your mind.

49
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:21,541
Life... school...

- How do you know if a boy likes you?

52
00:03:38,017 --> 00:03:39,101
- Well...

53
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:41,895
sometimes it's not so easy to tell.

54
00:03:41,895 --> 00:03:44,106
Guys don't always express their feelings.

55
00:03:45,107 --> 00:03:46,608
Is there someone that you like?

56
00:03:46,608 --> 00:03:48,152
- Yes.

57
00:03:48,152 --> 00:03:50,278
- And have you told
this person how you feel?

58
00:03:50,278 --> 00:03:51,655
- I have not.

59
00:03:51,655 --> 00:03:52,865
- Why?

60
00:03:54,574 --> 00:03:56,869
- What if he does not like me in return?

61
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:59,705
- Hmm. That's always a possibility.

62
00:04:00,789 --> 00:04:02,124
What is it you like about him?

63
00:04:03,542 --> 00:04:05,085
- He is funny.

64
00:04:05,085 --> 00:04:06,628
He is warm.

65
00:04:06,628 --> 00:04:08,338
We share many interests.

66
00:04:09,255 --> 00:04:13,135
- Well, then I'd say there's a pretty good
chance he might like you back.

67
00:04:13,135 --> 00:04:15,679
You're a very special girl.

68
00:04:15,679 --> 00:04:19,349
If I were you, I'd tell him how you feel.

you dropped the ball when we were kids?"

put my ass on the line

Sometime.

You need advice on something?

I enjoy spending time with you.

00:05:25,582 --> 00:05:28,961
You are a male, and yet you possess
many prominent female traits,

93
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:30,296

You're like... you're like
the little sister I never had.

101
00:05:50,816 --> 00:05:51,817
- Sister?

102
00:05:51,817 --> 00:05:54,278
- Yeah. Like family.

103
00:05:54,278 --> 00:05:57,239
I'm always here for you,
and if you ever have a problem

104
00:05:57,239 --> 00:06:01,285
or something doesn't go your way,
you know that I'll always have your back.

I... should go now
or I will be late for school.

107
00:06:06,957 --> 00:06:09,459
- Good, good.
No, school's important.

108
00:06:09,459 --> 00:06:11,212
Learn... Learn a lot!

109
00:06:15,382 --> 00:06:18,510
- Hey, you know she's
way too mature for you, right?

110
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:20,054
- Not listening, not laughing.

111
00:06:20,054 --> 00:06:23,224
- I think it's cute.
You're an attractive guy, she sees it.

112
00:06:23,224 --> 00:06:25,267
- End of conversation, later.

113
00:06:27,644 --> 00:06:28,979
- He's attractive, right?

114
00:06:30,397 --> 00:06:33,567
- Eh, looks better goin' than comin'.

115
00:06:33,567 --> 00:06:37,863
- It's been almost a year since the Union
granted protective status to Heveena

116
00:06:37,863 --> 00:06:39,865
and her colony of Moclan refugees.

117
00:06:39,865 --> 00:06:43,077
Per the agreement, the Union Council
and the Moclan government

118
00:06:43,077 --> 00:06:46,872
are each entitled to conduct
an annual inspection of the colony

119
00:06:46,872 --> 00:06:49,917
to make sure both sides
are abiding by its terms.

120
00:06:49,917 --> 00:06:53,379
Due to the Orville's history
and familiarity with the colony,

121
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:57,591
I've assigned Commanders Grayson
and Bortus to represent the Union.

122
00:06:57,591 --> 00:06:59,093
- What are we looking for exactly?

123
00:06:59,093 --> 00:07:01,762
- Any sign of interference
from the Moclan authorities...

124
00:07:01,762 --> 00:07:04,014
threats, harassment, surveillance,

125
00:07:04,014 --> 00:07:06,350
any act of aggression,
no matter how small,

126
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:07,976
that would violate the agreement.

127
00:07:07,976 --> 00:07:11,563
- And if I may ask,
who are the Moclans sending?

128
00:07:11,563 --> 00:07:15,067
- Their inspection team will be led
by a high-ranking intelligence officer,

129
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:16,402
Commander Kodon.

130
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:20,072
Keep in mind they still regard Heveena
with a great deal of suspicion.

131
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:22,824
They'll be looking for any indication
that she's broken her word

132
00:07:22,824 --> 00:07:25,786
to stop smuggling
newborn females off Moclus.

133
00:07:25,786 --> 00:07:27,454
- When are we expected?

134
00:07:27,454 --> 00:07:28,914
- In two days. You'll take a shuttle,

135
00:07:28,914 --> 00:07:31,750
which will rendezvous with one
of their shuttles in orbit of the colony.

136
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,168
- Understood.

137
00:07:33,168 --> 00:07:35,503
- Captain, you're aware
of the tension that exists

138
00:07:35,503 --> 00:07:38,299
between Moclus
and the rest of the Union right now.

139
00:07:38,299 --> 00:07:41,427
They're our strongest ally
against the Kaylon threat,

140
00:07:41,427 --> 00:07:45,889
so we can't afford to do
anything that might make things worse.

141
00:07:45,889 --> 00:07:47,641
Do I make myself clear?

142
00:07:47,641 --> 00:07:49,601
- We'll be very careful, sir.

143
00:07:49,601 --> 00:07:52,479
- Report back as soon
as you've completed your inspection.

144
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:53,814
Halsey out.

♪

146
00:08:08,329 --> 00:08:10,456
- You know this is
a diplomatic mission, right?

147
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:12,958
- The Moclans will no doubt bring weapons.

148
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:16,420
- I've reviewed the inspection protocols.
Sidearms only.

00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:21,549
Are you going to visit the sanctuary
where Heveena lives?

151

- Yes.

152

- May I please go with you?
I would love to meet her.

153

- Commander Grayson and I
have important duties to perform.

154
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,311
It would not be appropriate.

155

- Please, Papa.

156
00:08:35,939 --> 00:08:37,232
- Topa...

157
00:08:37,232 --> 00:08:42,112
there will be Moclans present
who are hostile to all females.

158
00:08:42,112 --> 00:08:45,324
I will not subject you
to their ignorance and ridicule.

159
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:49,870
- Y'know, Bortus, she's never had a chance
to meet any other Moclan females.

160
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:52,122
This could be a life-altering

00:23:20,115 --> 00:23:23,952
or Commander Grayson, or anyone else.

327
00:23:23,952 --> 00:23:29,166
If that makes you uncomfortable,
I understand.

328
00:23:29,166 --> 00:23:34,004
We will say goodnight now
and always remain friends.

329
00:23:35,463 --> 00:23:36,965
- I want to help.

330
00:23:37,716 --> 00:23:39,260
I will tell no one.

331
00:23:40,635 --> 00:23:42,263
What is it?

332
00:23:43,722 --> 00:23:47,268
- We have reestablished
our underground network

333
00:23:47,268 --> 00:23:52,981
to rescue female infants from Moclus
and bring them here to safety.

334
00:23:52,981 --> 00:23:56,902
- But... does that not violate
the agreement?

335
00:23:56,902 --> 00:23:59,029
- It does.

336
00:23:59,029 --> 00:24:02,866
- But... if Moclus found out...

337
00:24:02,866 --> 00:24:05,202
- They would destroy this colony.

338
00:24:05,202 --> 00:24:10,665
Which is why our efforts here
and on Moclus must be tightly coordinated.

339
00:24:10,665 --> 00:24:15,670
We have no reliable way of communicating
outside the nebula,

340
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:20,342
so all contact
from those wishing to flee Moclus

341
00:24:20,342 --> 00:24:22,719
is being done by messengers.

342
00:24:22,719 --> 00:24:25,889
It is slow and very inefficient.

343
00:24:26,723 --> 00:24:30,518
If we had access to a Union starship,

344
00:24:30,518 --> 00:24:34,064
one with an advanced
communications array...

345
00:24:36,108 --> 00:24:41,029
we could save so many more females,
with greater speed.

346
00:24:41,029 --> 00:24:44,199
But we would need someone on board

347
00:24:44,199 --> 00:24:46,952
who is loyal to our cause.

348
00:24:47,869 --> 00:24:50,372

- It is very simple.

351
00:24:55,543 --> 00:24:59,840
From time to time,
you will receive an encrypted message.

352
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:04,428
You will relay that message
to our contact on Moclus.

353
00:25:04,428 --> 00:25:08,849
These messages will be transmitted
on quantum frequencies

and the others involved.

- How could you put her in that position?
She's a child!

487

- She is also a victim of Moclan bigotry!

It was her choice!

She worships you!

She would do anything to please you,
of course she's gonna say yes!

495

- The best option is for Heveena

she's been violating the agreement

and that she enlisted Topa to help them
continue their illegal operations.

525
00:39:59,365 --> 00:40:02,784
That would demonstrate a clear motive
for the Moclans to abduct Topa,

526
00:40:02,784 --> 00:40:05,620
and we'd have cause to launch

maybe six or seven years old,

I accidentally cut three of my toes
on a broken mason jar.

603
00:46:02,269 --> 00:46:05,855
I mean, they were cut bad,
almost falling off.

604
00:46:05,855 --> 00:46:08,233
Course we lived miles
from the nearest doctor,

605
00:46:08,233 --> 00:46:11,987
and we were real poor,
so my mama had to be very resourceful.

So you know what she did?

607
00:46:13,863 --> 00:46:16,866
She used cornmeal to stop the bleeding,

608
00:46:16,866 --> 00:46:20,120
and she used kerosene for antiseptic,

609
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:23,123
and she took her sewing needles,

610
00:46:23,123 --> 00:46:26,084
and she sewed
my little toes back together.

611
00:46:27,294 --> 00:46:30,088
Course my daddy and my brothers
all had to hold me down.

612
00:46:30,088 --> 00:46:32,382
But it worked, they healed,

613
00:46:32,382 --> 00:46:36,011
and I'm still walking around today,
on my little tippy toes.

614
00:46:37,721 --> 00:46:41,517

of this parable.

It's just a story.

I'll tell you one thing, though.

617
00:46:46,396 --> 00:46:50,108
My mama knew somethin' needed
to be done right then and there.

If you do the right thing
in the here and now,

of taking care of itself.

Heveena's illegal actions

01:23:01,572 --> 01:23:02,907
- Come in.

972
01:23:04,616 --> 01:23:07,035
- Hey. Sorry to interrupt.

973
01:23:07,035 --> 01:23:09,371
Just wanted to let you know
we'll be leaving orbit soon.

974
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:12,875
And I also wanted to say...

975
01:23:13,834 --> 01:23:15,377
welcome back, Klyden.

976
01:23:17,629 --> 01:23:19,047
- Thank you, Commander.

977
01:23:20,173 --> 01:23:22,217
- I take it you've decided to stay?

978
01:23:22,217 --> 01:23:26,304
- We have renounced
our Moclan citizenship.

979
01:23:26,304 --> 01:23:29,683
Our home is here, now.

980
01:23:29,683 --> 01:23:33,562
- Bortus has told me
of your heroic actions.

981
01:23:33,562 --> 01:23:36,774
Thank you for saving my daughter's life.

982
01:23:38,442 --> 01:23:40,151
- Bortus and I make a pretty good team.

983
01:23:44,114 --> 01:23:45,866
Well, I'll let you get back to your meal.

984
01:23:47,576 --> 01:23:48,911
- Commander.

985
01:23:52,623 --> 01:23:55,751
Would you like to have dinner with us?

986
01:23:58,796 --> 01:24:00,631
- He made teepok soup.

987
01:24:00,631 --> 01:24:01,799
It's spicy.

988
01:24:03,467 --> 01:24:05,176
- I do like spicy.

989
01:24:05,176 --> 01:24:07,220
- Then please.

990
01:24:07,220 --> 01:24:09,431
Sit with us.
