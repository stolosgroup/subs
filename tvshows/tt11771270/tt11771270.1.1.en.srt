<i>Without you,
I'd have been killed...</i>

3
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,040
<i>right at the start.</i>

4
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,280
<i>That's how we met.</i>

5
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,760
<i>That's why we met.</i>

6
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,080
<i>It was in the stars.</i>

7
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,560
<i>And we believed in the stars.</i>

8
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,040
<i>You and I.</i>

9
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,400
<i>Out there, back then,</i>

10
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,200
<i>it didn't matter where we came from,</i>

11
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,080
<i>Europe or Russia.</i>

12
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,560
<i>Since Plymouth Rock,
to you we were all just the same.</i>

13
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,200
<i>We were all just...</i>

14
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,720
<i>The English.</i>

15
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:29,240
<i>It's funny then,
that after all these years,</i>

16
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,440
<i>I only have one word left.</i>

17
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,000
A Pawnee word.

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,440
Your word...

19
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,320
{\an8}<i>"I cherish you."</i>

20
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,560
<i>And in between...</i>

21
00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:01,280
<i>I wanted to kill a man
for the murder of my child.</i>

22
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,000
<i>You wanted back your land...</i>

23
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,160
<i>stolen from you.</i>

24
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,480
<i>But the difference between what we want...</i>

25
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,240
<i>and what we need,</i>

26
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,440
<i>well, that was something we both...</i>

27
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,520
<i>had yet to learn.</i>

28
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,360
Bet you knew it,
even 'fore you squeezed the trigger!

29
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,320
You done it buddy, shit!

30
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,320
You dead eyed son of a bitch.

31
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,080
You got him?

32
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,720
You fuckin' got him!

33
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,160
Who is he?

34
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,440
That there, sir...

35
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,760
That there is Running Hawk.

36
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:04,200
Led the Fetterman fight, '66.

37
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:08,320
Was him put Lonnie Myers' eyeballs
up on a rock.

38
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,920
It was us said
we'd do the same to him some day.

39
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,840
'Cept now I gone
and clean blown his face off.

40
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,880
S'okay.

41
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,720
Got us a couple of spares.

42
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:33,120
Orders were, round them up,
send them on their way.

43
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,600
What we just done.

44
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,360
Do it again
if you care to look the other way.

45
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,080
{\an8}Mother!

46
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,080
Not today.

47
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,360
Says who?

48
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,080
Says me.

49
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,160
How so?

50
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,160
It's my last.

51
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,720
{\an8}You are one of them!

52
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,320
Right, round her up
and get her out of here.

53
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,880
How's that you kill one, follow another?

54
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,560
Something like.

55
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,000
What do you want?

56
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,480
I'm sorry about yesterday.

57
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,320
But he had it coming.

58
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,960
- Long time.
- Yes, sir.

59
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,680
Lonnie and me, we was 16.

60
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,400
Joined up greenhorns together.

61
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:01,040
What they did to him...

62
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,720
that could've been me.

63
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,920
Could a been...

64
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,440
Could've been any of us.

65
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,440
How long you been in?

66
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,880
Longer than you.

67
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,120
What you gonna do now?

68
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,440
North.

69
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,120
- Back to your Res?
- Nebraska.

70
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,800
- The Loup.
- Why?

71
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,880
Born there.

72
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,040
But that ain't Pawnee land no more.

73
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,240
Don't want it all, just a few acres.

74
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,280
Which they won't give you.

75
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,920
Homestead Act.

76
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,280
That ain't for you.

77
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,760
Section Two:

78
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,400
Persons having performed service
in the army of the United States,

79
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,800
may make a claim.

80
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,840
I intend to.

81
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,680
Smoke dreams for the fireside.

82
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:58,640
Lonnie's brother, Billy Myers.

83
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,000
Remember him?

84
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,560
Uh-hmm.

85
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,600
I hear he's up there.

86
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,800
- Nebraska?
- Wyoming.

87
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,760
Caine County or some such.

88
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,920
You might wanna look him up.

89
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,840
Ain't looking to.

90
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:13,000
But if you do,
you tell him we finally got him.

91
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,240
We finally got Lonnie's killer.

92
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,960
So long, sergeant.

93
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,440
The best First Shirt I ever served.

94
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,840
Just you remember,
in there you been one of us.

95
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,640
But out here...

96
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,520
you're one of them.

97
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:20,040
<i>There are many
who can welcome you to the real America,</i>

98
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:26,640
but only one who can truly mean it.

99
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,920
Why? Why do you have to drive
so bloody fast?

100
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,160
Because I told him to.

101
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,680
Why?

102
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,120
- Indians.
- Like I said.

103
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,840
What, what Indians?

104
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,280
- Ghost dancers.
- Like I said.

105
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,840
Dancing Indians...

106
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,560
that's something to be afraid of?

107
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,080
It is when they stop.

108
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,840
Well, I didn't see any.

109
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,600
Well, now you can.

110
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,240
What did he do?

111
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,240
Drew!

112
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,040
What'd he do?

113
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,720
I don't know, Mr. Watts.

114
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,680
What did the shit-sniffer do?

115
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,000
I'll tell you what he did.

116
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,920
He walked straight into my hotel
and he asked me for a drink.

117
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,600
That's what he did.

118
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:52,480
Even said please, as I recall.

119
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,560
No, ma'am, you don't have
to mark him down for his manners,

120
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,480
just the color of his skin.

121
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,920
Who beat him?

122
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,640
You're most welcome.

123
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,600
Do you speak English?

124
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,800
What can I do?

125
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,760
You alone?

126
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,560
Yes.

127
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,280
Anyone in there with you?

128
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,560
No.

129
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,240
Nothing you can do.

130
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,240
Because I'm a woman?

131
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,440
Not your fight.

132
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,240
Don't pick it.

133
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,640
I'll give you ten dollars to cut him down.

134
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,360
Ten dollars to clean him up
and then ten more to see him on his way.

135
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,440
Lot of money.

136
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,120
And by the look of things, you need it.

137
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,960
I'm not unversed
in matters of business, sir,

138
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,360
so be aware I am not...

139
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,680
the haggling type.

140
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,320
Oh, I'm not about to haggle
with you, ma'am.

141
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,080
Then we are agreed.

142
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,640
I'm just waiting for the full extent
of your parlous situation

143
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,000
to clarify upon your tender mind.

144
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,080
She always so mouthy?

145
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,560
Like a coon-dog down a gurney.

146
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,360
Get this thing turned round.

147
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,920
You're leaving.

148
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,640
Where?

149
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,200
Back to Ellsworth.

150
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,720
I didn't come from Ellsworth.

151
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,480
That's as close to Hell as I can think of.

152
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,640
You walk?

153
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,000
- To my horse.
- Oh, no.

154
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,320
To him.

155
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,720
My bag?

156
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,200
Payment for the ride.

157
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,400
You already got my horse.

158
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,480
And I can get me 25 for a scalp.

159
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,240
Your call.

160
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,160
Tell her to put it on.

161
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,200
I seen it.

162
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,080
Been with us a while.

163
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,240
Damn it.

164
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,320
Why is it you people
always got to see things first?

165
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,440
I saw it too!

166
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,680
Maybe I didn't get the need to say it.

167
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,440
It's us they want?

168
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,560
Uh-hmm.

169
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:34,800
Well, we ain't never gonna outrun them.

170
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,440
Team's beat.

171
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,480
Whoa!

172
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,680
Shouldn't never have agreed
to that turnaround.

173
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,040
Why did you?

174
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,560
Indians?

175
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:03,040
If they are,
go easier on you if you take these off.

176
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,560
Nice try.

177
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,760
You a scout?

178
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,880
Was.

179
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:17,320
You ain't no Apache, Pawnee then.

180
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,440
I've walked with the Pawnee.

181
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,200
- What name do you go by?
- Eli Whipp.

182
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,680
No, fool.

183
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,240
Pawnee name.

184
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,280
Ckirirahpiks.

185
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,320
"Wolf...

186
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,920
Wounded."

187
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,520
When you get given that?

188
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,320
Massacre Canyon.

189
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,640
Hell, yeah, against the Sioux?

190
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,560
So, tell me,
which Indian is it you actually do like,

191
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,800
seeing as you seem to fight
against them all?

192
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,080
We had enemies long before you turned up.

193
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,960
And the good gumption
to choose our side when we did!

194
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:01,240
Not so clever though on reckoning
we'd end up doing the same to you!

195
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:04,520
Less Wounded Wolf than Whipped Dog,

196
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,080
wouldn't you say?

197
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,720
That how you come by your English name?

198
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,880
Never say how
a thing's gonna turn out 'til it does.

199
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,760
They ain't Indians.

200
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,720
They're still trouble.

201
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,800
Bit of a home inventor.

202
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,800
You tried before?

203
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,200
Nope!

204
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,560
Yes, sir!

205
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,760
One way or another,
gonna show him some balls.

206
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,440
Oh, Hell.

207
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,240
My enemy's enemy.

208
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:10,200
You Pawnee sure know a thing about that.

209
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,560
- How many rounds?
- Ten.

210
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,440
Spent two on a jack-rabbit.

211
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,560
Then you missed.

212
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,080
Yes, I did.

213
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,600
Friends?

214
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,120
Where're you headed?

215
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,360
Ellsworth.

216
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,360
Late for Ellsworth.

217
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,200
Starting to feel that way.

218
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,440
- What you doing with him?
- Taking him in.

219
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,680
What for?

220
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,040
Killing a woman.

221
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,760
English woman.

222
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,200
Eh, don't look like you're taking him in.

223
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,680
See, Sir, uh,
I wasn't sure who you was

224
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,280
and I thought to have all the help
I can get.

225
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,800
We'll take him.

226
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,960
- Where?
- Nearest tree.

227
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,680
You too, you get in our way.

228
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,000
Well, now I...
I was looking to get a reward.

229
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,440
Dead Indian's the best you're gonna get.

230
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,600
I didn't kill no English woman.

231
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,840
Didn't need to.

232
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,920
I'm happy to do it here.

233
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,560
Wait a moment now!

234
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:57,000
This is a commercial business! Huh!

235
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:01,280
I can't have you spreading him
all over my prime asset.

236
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:05,720
- Shouldn't have picked him up.
- You're on horseback, I'm up here.

237
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,240
Odds sit with me.

238
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,480
Hmm, you think?

239
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,720
Come to bets, boy, it's three to one.

240
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,080
What do you say?

241
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,120
I said...

242
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,360
it's...

243
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,840
three...

244
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,040
to...

245
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,920
- one.
- I'll take it.

246
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,360
Oh, Hell!

247
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:12,520
Well, I am certainly pleased with that!

248
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,080
That woman really dead?

249
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,240
Will be.

250
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:20,240
- And you were gonna pin it on me?
- Well, that was the plan.

251
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,360
Well, I didn't know you like I do now.

252
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,960
That's gonna kill you.

253
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,240
At least I've got time to think about it.

254
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,120
"Deborah Crawford"...

255
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,640
where in the Hell did that name come from?

256
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,160
Hmm, you're right.

257
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,880
Maybe somethings're
better left forgotten.

258
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,440
This light, that dress,

259
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,960
you remind me of my wife.

260
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,800
But not the bleeding?

261
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,480
That too.

262
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,320
Where is she?

263
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,880
You looking to plead your case
to a better angel?

264
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:19,360
- I don't have a case.
- I don't have a wife.

265
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,000
You're gonna kill me.

266
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,400
I'm not... I'm not...

267
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,680
I am but I'm not for the reasons
that you think.

268
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,880
I'm...

269
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:57,840
I'm just so... angry.

270
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,040
Yup.

271
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:03,360
But can't help but wonder on the cause.

272
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,880
Someone killed my child.

273
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,080
- Ah...
- And now I'm gonna kill him.

274
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,480
Were.

275
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,360
Actually, not even then.

276
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,640
Not now, not then, not ever.

277
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:36,280
Because that's the kind of man he is.

278
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,640
How did he know?

279
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Ain't no tremor he can't feel.

280
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:05,680
Sometimes I think he dug
that mind of his so deep,

281
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:09,640
Devil just skipped out,
jumped straight into his heart.

282
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,360
Certainly that's how I learnt
to get so light on my feet.

283
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:20,480
You surely didn't hear me, now did you?

284
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,320
- Where?
- Everywhere.

285
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,720
I had so many choices.

286
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,520
And I surely question Southampton?

287
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,560
Oh, it was closest.

288
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,800
Liverpool's quicker, every time.

289
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,440
Still, Havana must've been a pleasant jig.

290
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,400
New Orleans.

291
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,280
Noticed you cut out St Louis;
shame, they got a bridge down there,

292
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,760
it's quite the marvel.

293
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:56,760
Oh, my, gadding about
with all that unbanked cash,

294
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,960
like dragging a stink-line for a skunk.

295
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:05,880
Couple of times we had to intervene
on your imminent demise.

296
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,120
Why bother?

297
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,960
He wanted journey's end here.

298
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,680
We're in the middle of nowhere.

299
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:21,000
The real America.

300
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:24,440
Maybe see if I can't plant
a cottonwood, or some such,

301
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:27,040
on top of you, make you a part of it.

302
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,400
If it's any consolation,

303
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,800
I hate him too.

304
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,400
Profit or loss,

305
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:38,360
there's nothing he don't think
sits either side of a ledger.

306
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:41,000
You'll be in there somewhere.

307
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,080
Know I am.

308
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,880
From the Saville Row suit
to the Burlington Brogues.

309
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,680
He has me gussied up
like a punked arse come Sunday prayers.

310
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,360
And I hate him for it.

311
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,920
Yes, ma'am, I do.

312
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,360
Let me go.

313
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,960
In truth,

314
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,680
I've mostly learnt to absorb
my belittlement...

315
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,120
confine my thoughts merely to my contract,

316
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:16,720
a contract which,
despite its sulfurous stink,

317
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:20,160
I find myself quite willing to uphold.

318
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:25,800
That is, bar, the odd hidden cost.

319
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,560
I get them from time to time.

320
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:31,840
Just give me a chance to spit in the soup.

321
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,760
Pathetic really, but there you go;

322
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,760
what else is left to the humbled servant?

323
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,320
You want to rape me?

324
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:49,160
I'm realistic
when it comes to issues of consent.

325
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,600
Then fuck a horse.

326
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,360
Useful thought.

327
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:58,000
What with the nights' drawing in.

328
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,920
Prairie oysters.

329
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,680
I'm gonna kill you.

330
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,240
They really are very good.

331
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,520
Not now.

332
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,640
Not then. But...

333
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,640
but I will.

334
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:36,600
You'll have to come back
from the dead to do it.

335
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,480
I will.

336
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:46,280
Then, uh, might you consider
coming back as my horse?

337
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,760
Mind the big ones.

338
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:53,520
Not quite the woman I expected.

339
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:00,040
You're everything I'd expect of a man.

340
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,280
Keep playing.

341
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,160
You run, I'll stalk you down.

342
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,640
It was my job.

343
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,080
Where's the other one?

344
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,280
Let's just leave.

345
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:30,880
Didn't come back for you.

346
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,480
Huh?

347
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:45,040
Someone wants to see you.

348
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,680
- Who?
- Him.

349
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,560
No!

350
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,320
No, no, no.

351
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,320
My bag.

352
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,600
- What?
- Where is it?

353
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:23,440
Uh, I... Box, uh, boss.

354
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,160
Keep him stood.

355
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,560
Can I... Can I stop playing now?

356
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,440
No.

357
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:49,320
My fingers, they gone all bubbly.

358
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,520
A Baptist, when I was a boy,
gave me my white name.

359
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,520
Eli Whipp.

360
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,160
Wanna know why?

361
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,760
I'm good with rope.

362
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,360
You called me "Shit sniffer".

363
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,520
Did I?

364
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,760
Weren't my name.

365
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,440
Maybe that's one for you to wear.

366
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,400
Please.

367
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,440
Oh, I ain't gonna kill you.

368
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,040
Let the horse decide.

369
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,760
See if you gave him enough to drink.

370
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,640
Let him go.

371
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:02,600
No.

372
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,280
Huh.

373
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,160
That was...

374
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,960
That was... Thank you.

375
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,520
For what?

376
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:19,920
Well, if you hadn't come
they were going to...

377
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,200
Your business, not mine.

378
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:25,120
Ah, but then it became yours,
so thank you.

379
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:26,960
And now it's not.

380
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,840
Is that what you came back for?

381
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,920
- Hmm?
- Your horse.

382
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,840
And this.

383
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:39,680
What's in it?

384
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,440
Medicine.

385
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,640
You ill?

386
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,640
Only without it.

387
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,120
Ah, magic.

388
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,840
Not a trick.

389
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,360
Oh no, no, I didn't say it was.

390
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:57,400
You see, this is...
This is a lock of my son's hair.

391
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,200
- Powerful.
- Yes.

392
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,520
It got me this far.

393
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,800
And now I've met you.

394
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,200
I'm leaving.

395
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:08,760
So...

396
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:11,040
So, what do I do?

397
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,760
Take your pick.

398
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,320
The one I rode in on's pretty good.

399
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,760
What about my things?

400
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,880
Take what you need.

401
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:23,000
I need everything.

402
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:25,160
Difference between what you need
and what you want

403
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,120
is what you can put on a horse.

404
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,680
Where are you going?

405
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,320
North.

406
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,160
Would you like to know
where I'm going?

407
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,080
- No.
- I'm going West!

408
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:39,600
Caine County, Powder River. Wyoming.

409
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:41,800
That's North.

410
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:43,800
Oh.

411
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,560
A month's ride, at least.

412
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,600
Your voice, English?

413
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:50,680
Yes.

414
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,400
Go back to English.

415
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,120
Oh no, I can't do that.

416
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,200
Up to you.

417
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,760
They know you got that?

418
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,600
And now you won't make ten miles.

419
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:14,160
It cannot be that this whole country's
only full of killers and thieves.

420
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,360
Look, will you help me?

421
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,960
- No.
- Please!

422
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,080
I got what I came for.

423
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,560
No, I don't believe
you came back just for that.

424
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,480
I backed up that horse!

425
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,600
Would a happened anyway.

426
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:30,920
But I did it!

427
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,440
- Your choice.
- What about this afternoon?

428
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:37,440
It wasn't your fight, this isn't mine.

429
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,320
No.

430
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,680
I mean that we're here at all.

431
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,640
When only this afternoon
you were tied up there,

432
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,160
I was lying down over there,

433
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:48,680
both about to get killed
and yet here we are.

434
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:52,000
And it's everyone else that's dead.

435
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,320
Like it was magic.

436
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,800
Like it is magic!

437
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:02,880
You did not just come back for that bag.

438
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,200
Or if you did, the bag made you do it.

439
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:09,000
This is my medicine.

440
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,360
My family's.

441
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:11,600
And this is mine.

442
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,160
This is my son's.

443
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,160
He is dead now.

444
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,400
And up on Powder River,

445
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:29,200
there is a man trying to forget
that he ever existed.

446
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:35,160
So I'm gonna go up there, to remind him.

447
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,680
And when I have,
it'll be the last thing he ever hears.

448
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:40,640
I swear it!

449
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:42,840
Lady, how long have you been
in this country?

450
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,000
Two weeks.

451
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,040
And how many killings have you seen?

452
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:49,640
Four.

453
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:51,960
In two weeks?

454
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,480
Well, I've lived here my whole life.

455
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:59,200
I've lost father, mother, wife,

456
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:01,040
sons, daughters, friends.

457
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,160
Family.

458
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:05,640
I've seen villages razed
and I've razed them myself:

459
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:09,440
men, women and children,
shot, cut, stuck, hung.

460
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,560
I've seen Hell and I've made Hell.

461
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:16,840
And I'll carry it from here
to the sky beyond.

462
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,320
But don't expect me to care for one boy.

463
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,360
Please.

464
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,160
Please.

465
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:00,800
Can you shoot?

466
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:03,000
If I have to.

467
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:05,240
Oh, you'll have to.

468
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:10,680
Them all been waiting for you.

469
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:14,800
Like they knew you was coming.

470
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:15,840
Yes.

471
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,320
- You know how to dry it?
- Hmm?

472
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:26,680
You can't carry a wet pig.

473
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:28,000
Not from here to Kearney.

474
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:29,280
Where's that?

475
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:30,680
North aways.

476
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:33,160
From there you're on your own.

477
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:37,040
So not just killers and thieves then,

478
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:38,680
has one such as you within it.

479
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:40,400
Been both,

480
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,560
likely both again.

481
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:44,360
How do you do?

482
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:45,840
Better on my own.

483
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:48,800
No, what's your name?

484
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:52,240
- I have many.
- But which do you like?

485
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:54,600
None.

486
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:55,960
That's something else we share.

487
00:44:57,160 --> 00:45:00,080
Mine's Cornelia Locke,
Lady Cornelia Locke.

488
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:03,760
That make you a wife of a chief?

489
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:04,920
Daughter.

490
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,040
I've never been married.

491
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:08,160
Never will be.

492
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,760
I'm also a Scorpio.
Do you know about that?

493
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:13,840
- What?
- Your star sign.

494
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,520
Um, in London it's all the rage.
I'll tell you about it.

495
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,480
Mine's about revenge.

496
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:23,320
Can't help but think yours is too.

497
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:32,600
Aim for the head.

497
00:45:33,305 --> 00:46:33,632
