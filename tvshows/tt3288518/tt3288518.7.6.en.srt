1
00:00:08,269 --> 00:00:09,723
I just gotta get used
to her being around.

2
00:00:09,747 --> 00:00:11,445
Kinda sounds like you got a kid.

3
00:00:11,532 --> 00:00:12,901
Thanks to her, I never,
ever want children.

4
00:00:12,925 --> 00:00:14,188
I run from babies.

5
00:00:14,275 --> 00:00:15,711
We have an open
teaching position,

6
00:00:15,798 --> 00:00:17,321
and you are a perfect fit.

7
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:20,236
Coming?

8
00:00:20,324 --> 00:00:23,022
When you know what you want,
you don't apologize for it.

9
00:00:23,109 --> 00:00:24,414
You go for it.

10
00:00:24,501 --> 00:00:25,739
Maggie, this is
my wife, Camilla.

11
00:00:25,763 --> 00:00:27,548
I remember you.

12
00:00:27,635 --> 00:00:30,420
I literally told her to
find a guy with kind eyes

13
00:00:30,507 --> 00:00:32,988
and a strong jawline
to stand next to her,

14
00:00:33,076 --> 00:00:34,756
and she would jump ten
points in the polls.

15
00:00:42,737 --> 00:00:44,218
Leather or tweed?

16
00:00:44,304 --> 00:00:46,307
- Oh, tweed, definitely.
- Very dignified.

17
00:00:50,006 --> 00:00:51,399
I won't pretend
that didn't hurt.

18
00:00:51,485 --> 00:00:53,966
- Don't be offended.
- You served your purpose.

19
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:55,793
I just don't want to
look too academic.

20
00:00:55,881 --> 00:00:57,579
Sure, that makes sense,

21
00:00:57,665 --> 00:01:00,843
considering today is your first
day as a literal professor!

22
00:01:00,929 --> 00:01:02,365
Are you excited?

23
00:01:02,453 --> 00:01:04,325
Artist-in-residence,
technically,

24
00:01:04,412 --> 00:01:06,302
and no, I am just too
nervous about the students...

25
00:01:06,326 --> 00:01:07,652
Oh, you think you're
gonna run into Kamila?

26
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:10,025
Oh, shit. You think
I'm gonna run into her?

27
00:01:10,112 --> 00:01:11,462
No!

28
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:14,725
No, I... no. I meant the
students, too, obviously.

29
00:01:14,813 --> 00:01:17,947
Nerve-racking. But, yeah.

30
00:01:18,033 --> 00:01:19,793
I mean, have you thought about
the very real possibility

31
00:01:19,817 --> 00:01:22,472
that you might see the woman
you rogered in an alleyway

32
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,213
and turned out to be
your new boss's wife?

33
00:01:24,301 --> 00:01:26,825
Shh, let's talk about
your problems instead.

34
00:01:26,912 --> 00:01:29,393
Okay? What's good
with Chaz these days?

35
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,936
I haven't said a
word about Charles.

36
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,397
No, no, but that little
cartoon thought bubble

37
00:01:34,484 --> 00:01:36,356
above your head has a
three-piece suit in it,

38
00:01:36,444 --> 00:01:38,837
and it's bespoke. Just saying.

39
00:01:38,924 --> 00:01:40,490
Okay, fine.

40
00:01:40,578 --> 00:01:42,710
I decided I'm gonna tell
Charles about Quinn.

41
00:01:42,798 --> 00:01:45,192
If she's actually
reentering politics

42
00:01:45,278 --> 00:01:48,585
and using him and his daughters
to boost the viability

43
00:01:48,673 --> 00:01:50,113
of her campaign, he
deserves to know.

44
00:01:50,197 --> 00:01:51,198
Uh-huh.

45
00:01:51,284 --> 00:01:53,156
And, if he stays with her,

46
00:01:53,242 --> 00:01:54,984
then at least I've done my part,

47
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:56,942
and he's aware that
she has an agenda.

48
00:01:57,028 --> 00:01:59,031
And if not, well then, you know,

49
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:02,774
he's making a informed decision
based on all the facts.

50
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:08,650
- What?
- You don't need to rescue him.

51
00:02:08,736 --> 00:02:10,739
I mean, he's not your
responsibility anymore.

52
00:02:10,825 --> 00:02:13,002
- Well, it's not just him.
- It's the girls, too.

53
00:02:13,088 --> 00:02:16,919
Oh, I didn't realize
you had joint custody.

54
00:02:17,006 --> 00:02:19,747
I have a hunch you'd
be nicer in the tweed.

55
00:02:27,711 --> 00:02:30,801
I've been surrounded by
greasy, un-showered roadies

56
00:02:30,889 --> 00:02:32,325
for weeks.

57
00:02:32,413 --> 00:02:33,848
New York cannot
come soon enough.

58
00:02:33,936 --> 00:02:35,590
- And neither can I.

59
00:02:35,676 --> 00:02:37,853
- Hey, now.
- Clear your schedule.

60
00:02:37,939 --> 00:02:39,680
We are not leaving
that apartment,

61
00:02:39,768 --> 00:02:42,336
except maybe to go to
the Pleasure Chest.

62
00:02:42,423 --> 00:02:44,860
So you want to get creative, hm?

63
00:02:44,947 --> 00:02:46,775
- Mm-hmm.
- What'd you have in mind?

64
00:02:46,861 --> 00:02:48,079
Hm, I don't know.

65
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:50,561
- Surprise me.

66
00:02:50,647 --> 00:02:52,694
Oh, Josh, can I have some
of this pureed apricot

67
00:02:52,781 --> 00:02:54,564
- in the fridge?
- Hey, shh.

68
00:02:54,651 --> 00:02:56,567
Can I call you back tonight?

69
00:02:56,653 --> 00:02:58,395
- Bye.

70
00:02:58,481 --> 00:03:01,746
Hey, can you just
not mention baby food

71
00:03:01,832 --> 00:03:03,462
- when I'm on the phone with KT?
- No, come on.

72
00:03:03,486 --> 00:03:05,116
You still haven't told
her about your offspring?

73
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,098
It's not like I haven't tried.

74
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,622
She's never here.

75
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:11,495
And when she is, she
usually just goes to sleep

76
00:03:11,581 --> 00:03:14,236
- right afterwards, so...
- Josh, you need to tell her.

77
00:03:14,324 --> 00:03:16,325
Okay? The longer you wait,
the bigger a deal it is.

78
00:03:16,413 --> 00:03:18,067
It's festering, like an abscess.

79
00:03:18,153 --> 00:03:21,549
Can you not compare my
daughter to an abscess, please?

80
00:03:21,635 --> 00:03:23,072
No, I meant the adorable kind.

81
00:03:24,986 --> 00:03:27,728
I'll figure it out on my time.

82
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:37,608
- Morning, hi.
- Good morning, Eliza.

83
00:03:37,694 --> 00:03:39,653
I'm just going to come
right out and say this.

84
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:41,587
Maybe I'm not the best
person to be telling you,

85
00:03:41,611 --> 00:03:42,961
so don't shoot the messenger,

86
00:03:43,048 --> 00:03:44,876
but there's something
that you need to know.

87
00:03:44,962 --> 00:03:47,444
- Hey.
- Are we meeting in here today?

88
00:03:47,531 --> 00:03:50,012
Hi, hi, team.

89
00:03:50,098 --> 00:03:51,709
Oof, you okay, Lies?

90
00:03:51,795 --> 00:03:53,188
What did you just call me?

91
00:03:53,276 --> 00:03:55,670
Lies, like short for Liza?

92
00:03:55,757 --> 00:03:57,497
Relax, it's funny.

93
00:03:57,585 --> 00:04:00,762
I have another meeting.

94
00:04:00,848 --> 00:04:04,112
Quinn, you are in good
hands with these two.

95
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:06,115
The conference room's open.

96
00:04:06,201 --> 00:04:09,336
Okay.

97
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,074
Support us and become VIP member 
to remove all ads from www.OpenSubtitles.org

98
00:04:18,082 --> 00:04:19,649
Speak later?

99
00:04:19,737 --> 00:04:21,478
Yeah, sure.

100
00:04:21,564 --> 00:04:24,175
I'll see you in there.

101
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:30,879
Something you need?

102
00:04:30,966 --> 00:04:32,880
No.

103
00:04:32,968 --> 00:04:34,838
Have a good meeting.

104
00:04:40,932 --> 00:04:43,586
The early buzz is really
helping with presales.

105
00:04:43,673 --> 00:04:45,502
Numbers are climbing.

106
00:04:45,588 --> 00:04:47,634
Are bulk sales responsible
for these numbers?

107
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:50,768
I hate to ask, Quinn, but you
understand given your history?

108
00:04:50,855 --> 00:04:52,814
- Oh, Liza.
- You sweet little elephant.

109
00:04:52,901 --> 00:04:54,250
You never forget a thing.

110
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:56,600
No, didn't you
read chapter three?

111
00:04:56,687 --> 00:04:58,471
I learned my lesson
from that fiasco.

112
00:04:58,558 --> 00:05:01,865
Also, did my assistant send
over the dietary restrictions

113
00:05:01,952 --> 00:05:03,476
for Elon Musk?

114
00:05:03,564 --> 00:05:05,044
He's vegan, but he
will do bone broth.

115
00:05:05,086 --> 00:05:06,915
Copy that.

116
00:05:07,002 --> 00:05:08,959
Everything else for the
party is looking great.

117
00:05:09,047 --> 00:05:10,658
Lauren has lined up
a bunch of press,

118
00:05:10,745 --> 00:05:13,137
and people seem to be excited
about the venue change.

119
00:05:13,225 --> 00:05:15,009
Did we change it
from The Beekman?

120
00:05:15,096 --> 00:05:17,273
Yeah, Quinn had
an in at the TWA.

121
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,319
As in the defunct airline?

122
00:05:19,406 --> 00:05:22,322
Liza, you of all
people should know

123
00:05:22,408 --> 00:05:24,540
that failure doesn't
mean you can't fly again.

124
00:05:24,627 --> 00:05:27,238
It's the perfect venue
for "The F Word."

125
00:05:27,326 --> 00:05:29,024
Any-who, thank you
for the update.

126
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:31,504
I've gotta run. I'm having
brunch with Kara Swisher,

127
00:05:31,591 --> 00:05:33,420
and if I'm late, she'll
vaporize my career.

128
00:05:38,903 --> 00:05:40,209
I know you're trying,

129
00:05:40,295 --> 00:05:41,949
but maybe don't stir
the pot so much.

130
00:05:42,036 --> 00:05:43,430
It's not me. It's Quinn!

131
00:05:43,516 --> 00:05:45,436
- She's a self-stirring pot.
- It's not worth it.

132
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:48,521
You know, people
keep telling me that.

133
00:05:48,608 --> 00:05:50,827
I'm starting to think you
all might be on to something.

134
00:05:50,915 --> 00:05:52,612
I'm just looking out for you.

135
00:05:52,699 --> 00:05:55,920
As someone who's gone head
to head with Quinn, trust me,

136
00:05:56,007 --> 00:05:59,793
there's no winning or losing.
There's just hangovers.

137
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,797
You're right, I just need to
focus on work... different work.

138
00:06:02,884 --> 00:06:04,470
Well, we're having dinner
with Redmond tonight,

139
00:06:04,494 --> 00:06:06,322
and I have a really
good feeling about it.

140
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:07,688
If he doesn't bail on us again.

141
00:06:07,757 --> 00:06:13,110
He won't. Gah, cheer up, Lies.

142
00:06:13,197 --> 00:06:14,242
It's catchy.

143
00:06:21,293 --> 00:06:23,774
Hm.

144
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:28,038
Okay, okay.

145
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:29,911
Too literal.

146
00:06:29,997 --> 00:06:34,305
This, people, is visual
arts, not figure drawing.

147
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:38,180
Now, what's the first thing we
all looked at on that statue?

148
00:06:38,266 --> 00:06:40,095
- His dick.
- Bingo.

149
00:06:40,182 --> 00:06:42,966
I mean, we can't help
it. It's in our nature,

150
00:06:43,053 --> 00:06:45,882
so tap into that
primal instinct.

151
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:47,841
I mean, lucky for us, sex sells.

152
00:06:47,928 --> 00:06:50,627
- Great class.

153
00:06:50,713 --> 00:06:53,281
- Thanks.
- Keep up the good work, people.

154
00:06:53,369 --> 00:06:55,326
Oh, Maggie, you're a natural.

155
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,043
- Whoa, thanks, Dean.
- I didn't see you there.

156
00:06:57,067 --> 00:06:59,375
- Please, Dean is my mother.
- Call me Cass.

157
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:00,781
What are you doing
tomorrow night,

158
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:02,639
because my wife would
love to cook for you.

159
00:07:02,725 --> 00:07:06,033
- You remember Kamila?
- Oh, how could I forget?

160
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,776
I'm sorry, but I have plans
with my, um... my girlfriend.

161
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:11,057
I didn't know you
were partnered up.

162
00:07:11,081 --> 00:07:12,692
It's very new.

163
00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:14,105
Well, you know, you
can bring her along.

164
00:07:14,129 --> 00:07:15,478
Kamila's a wonderful cook,

165
00:07:15,564 --> 00:07:17,281
and she has endless
capacity for small talk.

166
00:07:17,305 --> 00:07:19,612
She can go all night long.

167
00:07:19,699 --> 00:07:21,701
Um... dinner it is!

168
00:07:21,788 --> 00:07:24,704
- Oh, wonderful!
- Yeah.

169
00:07:31,886 --> 00:07:34,584
Very excited to hear who
you've got for us, Redmond.

170
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:37,630
Can't I order first?

171
00:07:37,718 --> 00:07:39,632
Fine, I was gonna
save this for dessert,

172
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,156
but get this...

173
00:07:41,242 --> 00:07:45,202
BD Mulvaney said Empirical
is her first choice,

174
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:48,076
and she's basically a lock for
"The Times" Best Seller List,

175
00:07:48,163 --> 00:07:50,730
so you're welcome.

176
00:07:50,817 --> 00:07:53,689
- BD who?
- BD Mulvaney.

177
00:07:53,776 --> 00:07:55,692
She's a mystery writer.

178
00:07:55,778 --> 00:07:58,651
Unpublished, but has a
huge online following

179
00:07:58,738 --> 00:08:00,088
with the AOL crowd.

180
00:08:00,175 --> 00:08:02,959
Her latest is called
"Murder, She Blogged."

181
00:08:07,704 --> 00:08:09,531
What's with the giggling?

182
00:08:09,619 --> 00:08:11,315
Is the air thinner up there?

183
00:08:11,403 --> 00:08:14,057
No offense, Redmond,
but generic label.

184
00:08:14,144 --> 00:08:16,278
"Murder, She Wrote"
doesn't sound very current.

185
00:08:16,365 --> 00:08:18,081
- Yeah, well, that's the point.
- It's cozy.

186
00:08:18,105 --> 00:08:22,065
There's tea, and
knitting, and gentle crime

187
00:08:22,153 --> 00:08:24,807
among upper middle class
white folks in coastal Maine.

188
00:08:24,894 --> 00:08:28,463
No, it's not current, but it
does somehow defy the times.

189
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,031
Redmond, are you kidding?

190
00:08:30,117 --> 00:08:31,379
There used to be a time

191
00:08:31,466 --> 00:08:32,966
when you were a
resource for Millennial.

192
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:34,557
Millennial?

193
00:08:34,644 --> 00:08:36,100
Uh, hm, I thought Millennial
can't come to the phone

194
00:08:36,124 --> 00:08:37,821
right now. Why?
Because she's dead.

195
00:08:37,908 --> 00:08:40,693
We still would like relevant
authors, okay, not dinosaurs.

196
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:42,173
That is not our brand.

197
00:08:42,259 --> 00:08:44,219
Ahh, this is exactly your brand.

198
00:08:44,306 --> 00:08:48,265
Millennial, Empirical, Mercury,
Sterling Cooper Peters Brooks,

199
00:08:48,352 --> 00:08:49,808
whatever the hell
you want to call it.

200
00:08:49,832 --> 00:08:51,661
"Murder, She Blogged"
is essentially

201
00:08:51,748 --> 00:08:54,750
the female "Arabian Sea ."
I should congratulate you.

202
00:08:54,837 --> 00:08:57,884
You ladies have emerged
as the mid-lit leaders

203
00:08:57,971 --> 00:08:59,190
of the new decade.

204
00:08:59,277 --> 00:09:01,889
- Mid-lit?
- Middle-aged literature.

205
00:09:01,975 --> 00:09:04,717
Last I heard, your
pipeline was stacked

206
00:09:04,804 --> 00:09:07,154
with historical
potboilers. True or False?

207
00:09:07,241 --> 00:09:08,721
Well, yes, but...

208
00:09:08,808 --> 00:09:10,724
Well, if you wanna stay
in that age bracket,

209
00:09:10,811 --> 00:09:14,379
the least you could do is get
the she/her point of view.

210
00:09:14,466 --> 00:09:17,294
Come on, this is win-win.
I can see it now:

211
00:09:17,381 --> 00:09:19,123
You publish the book,

212
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:21,735
CBS turns it into a procedural
starring Betty White,

213
00:09:21,822 --> 00:09:24,259
Metamucil pays the
ad sales up front,

214
00:09:24,346 --> 00:09:26,216
and we all reap the benefits.

215
00:09:26,303 --> 00:09:28,088
Lean into your identity, ladies.

216
00:09:28,176 --> 00:09:29,786
We all gotta eat.

217
00:09:31,134 --> 00:09:32,572
This is so depressing.

218
00:09:32,658 --> 00:09:34,661
Like, mid-lit?

219
00:09:34,748 --> 00:09:37,793
When did we go from
forward momentum

220
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,360
to just treading water?

221
00:09:39,447 --> 00:09:41,033
If I had to guess, I'd
say it was the day.

222
00:09:41,057 --> 00:09:43,104
Empirical took over
again as flagship.

223
00:09:43,191 --> 00:09:45,105
Rebrand, remember?

224
00:09:45,192 --> 00:09:47,760
- That was not a rebrand.
- That was an un-brand.

225
00:09:47,847 --> 00:09:49,413
We can fix this, Kels.

226
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,764
We just have to figure out...

227
00:09:54,288 --> 00:09:55,725
How do we beat the establishment

228
00:09:55,812 --> 00:09:58,597
when we've been effectively
swallowed by them?

229
00:09:58,684 --> 00:10:00,294
Isn't it obvious?

230
00:10:00,381 --> 00:10:02,863
You guys need to do a complete
180 in the opposite direction.

231
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:05,081
I mean, make your
movement grassroots.

232
00:10:05,168 --> 00:10:06,562
- To the people!
- Hey.

233
00:10:06,649 --> 00:10:09,520
Huh, the people think
we're some corporate,

234
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,610
thriller-on-a-ship,
murder-at-a-train-station,

235
00:10:11,697 --> 00:10:13,394
airport book factory.

236
00:10:13,481 --> 00:10:15,831
No, they think Empirical is.

237
00:10:15,918 --> 00:10:18,355
You and I are
independent, human women

238
00:10:18,442 --> 00:10:20,836
with our own agency
in this world.

239
00:10:20,923 --> 00:10:23,013
The advantage our
jobs have given us

240
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,450
is the ability to scout talent.

241
00:10:25,537 --> 00:10:27,669
We don't need Redmond for that.

242
00:10:27,756 --> 00:10:30,106
- Artists always find each other.
- Hm.

243
00:10:30,193 --> 00:10:32,022
Look at the Algonquin
Round Table.

244
00:10:32,109 --> 00:10:34,894
Those writers went
on to be legends,

245
00:10:34,981 --> 00:10:37,592
but it really just started with
friends sitting around a table,

246
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:39,334
drinking and telling stories.

247
00:10:39,421 --> 00:10:41,596
Pretty much what we're
doing right here.

248
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:43,293
Exactly.

249
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,644
Think about it:

250
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:47,864
We spread the word,
we...

251
00:10:47,951 --> 00:10:51,172
We invite unpublished
writers to come in, drink,

252
00:10:51,259 --> 00:10:54,566
read a few pages to a
like-minded audience,

253
00:10:54,653 --> 00:10:56,960
and you and I get back to
why we got into publishing

254
00:10:57,047 --> 00:10:58,265
in the first place.

255
00:10:58,352 --> 00:11:00,268
Okay.

256
00:11:00,355 --> 00:11:02,836
You are brilliant.

257
00:11:02,923 --> 00:11:04,315
But it's got to
stay underground.

258
00:11:04,402 --> 00:11:05,926
It's got to be cool,

259
00:11:06,013 --> 00:11:08,318
or there's gonna be a line
of boomers out the door.

260
00:11:08,405 --> 00:11:10,974
And where can we do this?

261
00:11:17,588 --> 00:11:20,331
What, here?

262
00:11:20,418 --> 00:11:22,158
Yeah! I mean, why not?

263
00:11:22,245 --> 00:11:24,379
I think it's pretty dope. Here.

264
00:11:24,466 --> 00:11:26,380
Oh, my god, we could
call it INKubator.

265
00:11:26,467 --> 00:11:27,511
That is...

266
00:11:27,599 --> 00:11:29,166
That's good.

267
00:11:29,253 --> 00:11:30,994
Okay, but how do we
get low-key publicity?

268
00:11:31,081 --> 00:11:32,952
- Like a Facebook group?
- Ahh! No!

269
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:34,562
Oh, my god, Liza.
No, no, no, no.

270
00:11:34,649 --> 00:11:36,870
Tell no one, and
everyone will be there.

271
00:11:36,956 --> 00:11:37,976
Okay? That's the
key.

272
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,437
That's the thing.

273
00:11:39,524 --> 00:11:43,789
You need to invite as
few people as possible...

274
00:11:43,876 --> 00:11:45,661
Right, it's not... it's
a figure of speech.

275
00:11:45,748 --> 00:11:47,270
In fact, maybe we should even...

276
00:11:47,357 --> 00:11:49,162
Let's make a secret friends
group. Wait, wait...

277
00:11:49,186 --> 00:11:51,493
Liza, are you listening?
I'm on fire over here.

278
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:53,190
Ooh, you guys, fire...

279
00:11:53,277 --> 00:11:55,018
- Tiki torches?
- No.

280
00:11:55,105 --> 00:11:56,995
- Okay, yeah, no, never mind.
- I'm spiraling from the whiskey.

281
00:11:57,019 --> 00:11:58,195
It's... delete it.

282
00:11:58,282 --> 00:12:00,414
Hey.

283
00:12:00,501 --> 00:12:02,243
Do you think we
can pull this off?

284
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:04,898
I have no idea.

285
00:12:04,985 --> 00:12:06,725
But what have we got to lose?

286
00:12:19,216 --> 00:12:21,523
It's coming...

287
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:26,135
- Hi, everyone!
- Welcome to INKubator.

288
00:12:26,222 --> 00:12:28,008
We started this little salon

289
00:12:28,095 --> 00:12:30,793
because we are passionate
about storytelling.

290
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:34,710
And we wanted to give writers
a platform without judgment,

291
00:12:34,797 --> 00:12:36,625
without the pressure
that often comes

292
00:12:36,711 --> 00:12:38,539
with pursuing a creative field.

293
00:12:38,626 --> 00:12:40,716
INKubator is a place
to share your pieces,

294
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:43,893
and to experience the
work of other artists.

295
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:46,417
The rough drafts we
never get to see.

296
00:12:46,504 --> 00:12:48,724
We have an open-mic
policy here at INKubator,

297
00:12:48,811 --> 00:12:51,118
- but first, drinks on us!
- Whoo-hoo!

298
00:12:57,427 --> 00:12:58,951
Wait, wait, okay.

299
00:12:59,038 --> 00:13:01,017
So we hate each other, and
we make snide remarks like:

300
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:02,758
"Wow, you sound just like
your mother right now."

301
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,173
That'll be fun, don't you think?

302
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,958
No, this is not
supposed to be fun.

303
00:13:06,046 --> 00:13:08,134
We're only here because
I want to keep my job.

304
00:13:08,221 --> 00:13:09,962
Now, I told Cass this is new,

305
00:13:10,049 --> 00:13:11,572
so we don't hate
each other yet, okay?

306
00:13:11,659 --> 00:13:12,966
Ah, okay, okay.

307
00:13:13,052 --> 00:13:14,159
Not what I prepared,
but I can take a note.

308
00:13:14,183 --> 00:13:16,707
New couple, lovey-dovey,
googly eyes, horny.

309
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:17,796
- Got it!
- No!

310
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,232
No horny vibes around the wife.

311
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,408
I don't know what's
gonna set her off.

312
00:13:21,495 --> 00:13:24,238
- That's not what you told me.
- Shh!

313
00:13:24,325 --> 00:13:25,979
- Hello!
- Hi.

314
00:13:26,066 --> 00:13:29,373
- Welcome.
- Hi.

315
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:31,071
Okay... okay.

316
00:13:33,725 --> 00:13:37,250
"And when their
antenna touched mine,

317
00:13:37,337 --> 00:13:40,731
I shuddered as four became two

318
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:45,519
became one."

319
00:13:45,606 --> 00:13:46,782
Thank you.

320
00:13:54,311 --> 00:13:55,922
Hey.

321
00:13:56,009 --> 00:13:57,052
I'm Liza.

322
00:13:57,139 --> 00:13:58,967
Dylan Park. Nice to meet you.

323
00:13:59,054 --> 00:14:01,100
Are you planning
on reading tonight?

324
00:14:01,187 --> 00:14:02,450
Um...

325
00:14:02,537 --> 00:14:04,668
It's awesome that
you've created a place

326
00:14:04,755 --> 00:14:08,412
free of pressure, but I
still feel the pressure.

327
00:14:08,499 --> 00:14:10,806
You were just listening
to that, right?

328
00:14:10,893 --> 00:14:13,591
Point being, there are
no expectations here.

329
00:14:13,677 --> 00:14:16,638
- It's not that.
- I'm pretty proud of my work.

330
00:14:16,725 --> 00:14:18,552
Oh.

331
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,903
- Stage fright?
- Yep.

332
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:23,210
Public speaking isn't my forte.

333
00:14:23,297 --> 00:14:24,994
You're a writer,
not a performer.

334
00:14:25,081 --> 00:14:26,648
It makes sense.

335
00:14:26,735 --> 00:14:29,129
What's your writing about,
if you don't mind my asking?

336
00:14:29,216 --> 00:14:31,130
Nothing crazy.

337
00:14:31,217 --> 00:14:32,914
It's just a
multi-generational story

338
00:14:33,001 --> 00:14:34,326
following the
coming-of-age journeys

339
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:35,482
of a mother during the '70s,

340
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:37,010
and her daughter in
the early oughts,

341
00:14:37,049 --> 00:14:39,922
converging in modern day Queens.

342
00:14:40,009 --> 00:14:41,532
I may have practiced that.

343
00:14:41,619 --> 00:14:44,621
And I may be super intrigued.

344
00:14:44,709 --> 00:14:46,885
Are those your pages?

345
00:14:46,972 --> 00:14:50,411
Well, if you'd be comfortable
sharing with just one person...

346
00:14:50,498 --> 00:14:52,239
I'd love to read them.

347
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:02,030
- To Maggie's first class.
- Yes!

348
00:15:02,118 --> 00:15:04,163
- Mazel tov!
- Salud.

349
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:14,565
I am so proud of you, possum.

350
00:15:18,004 --> 00:15:20,354
- Lauren, st...
- Frisky, I tell you, girls.

351
00:15:20,441 --> 00:15:22,878
She cannot get enough.

352
00:15:22,965 --> 00:15:24,619
I bet.

353
00:15:24,706 --> 00:15:26,229
- More wine?
- Oh, yeah!

354
00:15:26,316 --> 00:15:27,187
- Oh, yes, please.
- Thank you, love.

355
00:15:27,274 --> 00:15:29,711
You guys are fun. So much fun.

356
00:15:29,798 --> 00:15:30,993
You should join us
for our girls' weekend

357
00:15:31,017 --> 00:15:32,539
in Provincetown.

358
00:15:32,626 --> 00:15:34,344
We have a nifty share house
in the Gallery District.

359
00:15:34,368 --> 00:15:35,412
P-town?

360
00:15:35,499 --> 00:15:37,326
Uh, yes! Sign our P's up.

361
00:15:37,413 --> 00:15:38,588
What are your dates?

362
00:15:38,676 --> 00:15:41,331
Labor Day's a no-go.
When is Carnival?

363
00:15:41,418 --> 00:15:43,158
- I don't know.
- I will grab my calendar.

364
00:15:43,245 --> 00:15:44,508
Yes, I'm old-school,

365
00:15:44,595 --> 00:15:46,857
and yes, it's a Kacey
Musgraves Wall cal.

366
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,730
It was a gift!

367
00:15:51,124 --> 00:15:54,735
- Love her.
- P-town, really?

368
00:15:54,822 --> 00:15:56,192
I mean, you're supposed to
be shielding me from Kamila,

369
00:15:56,216 --> 00:15:58,173
not signing me up for
gay-cations with her!

370
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:01,481
- Okay.

371
00:16:01,568 --> 00:16:04,005
Wait, "Kamila would
like to share a photo."

372
00:16:04,092 --> 00:16:05,528
- What's AirDrop?

373
00:16:05,615 --> 00:16:06,703
It's her boobs. Hit accept.

374
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:08,315
No... Lauren! Oh, Jesus.

375
00:16:08,402 --> 00:16:09,663
Oh, oh, oh.

376
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,753
Oh, my god, she's dropping more.

377
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,451
Wait, she's taking
these from the bathroom.

378
00:16:14,538 --> 00:16:16,539
Oh, my god. Wait, wait...
no, no, no, no, no.

379
00:16:16,626 --> 00:16:17,932
Stop drop... stop drop...

380
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:19,543
Okay, she is clearly
jealous of me.

381
00:16:19,629 --> 00:16:20,892
Mission accomplished, right?

382
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:28,725
- It's good.
- So good.

383
00:16:28,812 --> 00:16:32,426
It's funny, and
fresh, and thoughtful.

384
00:16:32,513 --> 00:16:36,385
IT's exactly the sort of
thing that mid-lit isn't.

385
00:16:36,472 --> 00:16:39,475
Liza, you're like one
of those Italian hounds

386
00:16:39,562 --> 00:16:42,304
that hunts for truffles
in large fields of shit.

387
00:16:42,392 --> 00:16:43,480
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

388
00:16:47,179 --> 00:16:49,355
I think we should
bring this to Charles.

389
00:16:49,442 --> 00:16:52,620
I mean, Empirical could give
Dylan her very first book deal,

390
00:16:52,706 --> 00:16:54,403
and that could be
huge for her career.

391
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:56,927
Mid-lit be damned. I'm in!

392
00:16:57,015 --> 00:16:58,668
Yes.

393
00:17:00,496 --> 00:17:03,760
Mm.

394
00:17:03,847 --> 00:17:05,327
Seriously?

395
00:17:05,414 --> 00:17:08,288
Thank you.

396
00:17:09,854 --> 00:17:11,116
Dylan Park!

397
00:17:31,267 --> 00:17:32,789
Hey, is Josh home?

398
00:17:32,876 --> 00:17:34,836
- Nope, he's on his way.
- Come on in.

399
00:17:34,923 --> 00:17:36,770
Take a load off, make
yourself at home, etc., etc.

400
00:17:36,794 --> 00:17:37,708
Thanks.

401
00:17:37,795 --> 00:17:39,188
I'll just wait in his room.

402
00:17:39,275 --> 00:17:40,687
I wanna get out of these
smelly bus clothes.

403
00:17:40,711 --> 00:17:42,538
Okay.

404
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:49,807
Um...

405
00:17:49,894 --> 00:17:53,984
Why does Josh have all this
baby stuff in his room?

406
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,354
Um... you know what, that's
actually none of my business.

407
00:17:56,423 --> 00:17:58,685
Okay? That's between you
two, not me. That's private.

408
00:17:58,772 --> 00:18:01,905
Okay? Okay, cool. Good. I'm
so glad we discussed that.

409
00:18:01,992 --> 00:18:03,169
Okay, I gotta go.

410
00:18:18,575 --> 00:18:19,968
Oh.

411
00:18:20,055 --> 00:18:21,273
Hey.

412
00:18:21,361 --> 00:18:23,798
Here, have a Quinn and tonic.

413
00:18:23,884 --> 00:18:26,887
It's weird.

414
00:18:26,974 --> 00:18:28,367
Is that rum?

415
00:18:28,454 --> 00:18:30,065
- Why isn't it gin?
- Yeah.

416
00:18:30,152 --> 00:18:32,459
- That's why it's weird.

417
00:18:32,546 --> 00:18:34,677
Wow, look at this crowd.

418
00:18:34,765 --> 00:18:36,636
Oh, yeah.

419
00:18:36,723 --> 00:18:38,283
"The Times," "Wall
Street Journal," NPR,

420
00:18:38,334 --> 00:18:40,944
some cable news folks, and
they don't show up for books.

421
00:18:41,031 --> 00:18:42,643
It's basically a
press conference

422
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:43,861
- with a cocktail hour.
- Hm.

423
00:18:43,948 --> 00:18:46,472
The power of Quinn Tyler.

424
00:18:48,474 --> 00:18:50,215
Mm, it's growing on me.

425
00:18:50,302 --> 00:18:53,174
Like, it tastes wrong at
first, but I don't know,

426
00:18:53,261 --> 00:18:54,394
it gets the job done.

427
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,614
Kinda like our guest of honor.

428
00:18:57,701 --> 00:18:59,224
Wait, Charles brought his kids?

429
00:18:59,311 --> 00:19:02,009
Yeah, Quinn was
adamant that they come.

430
00:19:04,925 --> 00:19:06,362
- I'm gonna be right back.
- Yeah.

431
00:19:06,449 --> 00:19:08,364
Hey.

432
00:20:00,373 --> 00:20:03,506
Hey, KT. You here?

433
00:20:03,593 --> 00:20:05,160
I'm waiting for you.

434
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:07,944
She's waiting for us.

435
00:20:08,031 --> 00:20:10,251
There you go.

436
00:20:10,338 --> 00:20:13,472
Okay, I'll be right back.

437
00:20:16,476 --> 00:20:20,261
Hi, Daddy. I'm hung-wy.

438
00:20:20,348 --> 00:20:23,134
Oh, my god.

439
00:20:23,221 --> 00:20:25,788
- It's okay, it's okay.
- I'm into whatever you're into.

440
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:27,313
Let me go there with you.

441
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:31,621
- Uh...

442
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:33,710
Oh.

443
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:49,377
- Hey, there.
- Hi, Liza!

444
00:20:49,464 --> 00:20:51,250
- Hi.

445
00:20:51,336 --> 00:20:52,816
Hi, sweetie.

446
00:20:52,903 --> 00:20:54,209
We missed you so much.

447
00:20:54,296 --> 00:20:56,864
- Oh, I miss you, too.
- Hi, girls.

448
00:20:56,951 --> 00:20:59,213
Charles, Quinn wants to borrow
the girls for her speech.

449
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:02,695
What? That's insane.

450
00:21:02,782 --> 00:21:04,611
Uh... That's fine.

451
00:21:04,698 --> 00:21:06,176
- Come on, yeah?
- No, wait.

452
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:09,442
Charles, can I talk
to you for a second?

453
00:21:09,528 --> 00:21:11,269
Go on. I'll be right here.

454
00:21:11,356 --> 00:21:13,750
No, don't.

455
00:21:16,057 --> 00:21:18,406
Sorry.

456
00:21:23,499 --> 00:21:25,719
You're letting her
borrow your daughters?

457
00:21:25,806 --> 00:21:27,547
It's no big deal.

458
00:21:27,634 --> 00:21:29,417
It is a big deal, Charles.

459
00:21:29,505 --> 00:21:31,071
I wasn't going to say anything,

460
00:21:31,159 --> 00:21:35,597
but it feels irresponsible
if I don't at this point.

461
00:21:35,684 --> 00:21:38,035
I just got confirmation
that you're being used.

462
00:21:38,122 --> 00:21:40,559
- What are you talking about?
- I heard from my source

463
00:21:40,646 --> 00:21:43,039
that Quinn is announcing her
run for governor tonight.

464
00:21:43,126 --> 00:21:44,390
Right now.

465
00:21:44,477 --> 00:21:46,521
And she's using your
family to give her

466
00:21:46,608 --> 00:21:50,613
the picture-perfect image she
didn't have last time around.

467
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,007
It's the truth.

468
00:21:53,094 --> 00:21:54,487
Thank you.

469
00:21:54,574 --> 00:21:57,794
Thank you all so much
for being here tonight.

470
00:21:57,881 --> 00:21:59,665
"The F Word" really
is a testament

471
00:21:59,752 --> 00:22:01,971
to a woman rising
from the ashes.

472
00:22:02,058 --> 00:22:04,323
I've had many
failures in my life.

473
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:06,803
Including in relationships.

474
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:08,892
But for the first
time, I am with someone

475
00:22:08,979 --> 00:22:10,938
who wholeheartedly supports me,

476
00:22:11,025 --> 00:22:13,854
and whose family has
become like my own.

477
00:22:13,941 --> 00:22:15,637
IT almost makes me feel like

478
00:22:15,724 --> 00:22:17,485
maybe I should take another
stab at all the other things

479
00:22:17,509 --> 00:22:19,250
I failed at.

480
00:22:19,337 --> 00:22:22,905
Bianca and Nicole, come
on out here, girls.

481
00:22:22,992 --> 00:22:24,778
You have been such a
bright spot in my life.

482
00:22:24,865 --> 00:22:28,128
You have inspired me to
pursue a lifelong dream.

483
00:22:28,215 --> 00:22:29,869
Come here.

484
00:22:29,957 --> 00:22:31,959
You're not gonna do anything?

485
00:22:32,046 --> 00:22:34,177
You've got the wrong idea, Liza.

486
00:22:34,265 --> 00:22:35,832
And with that,

487
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:39,096
it is my honor to
announce that I'm...

488
00:22:42,796 --> 00:22:44,927
Starting a scholarship program!

489
00:22:45,015 --> 00:22:47,670
You girls are so
inspiring. Get in here.

490
00:22:50,759 --> 00:22:52,153
Thank you so much.

491
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,199
I owe you an apology.

492
00:22:55,286 --> 00:22:56,679
- Forget it.
- No.

493
00:22:56,766 --> 00:22:59,900
I'm sorry. I didn't realize...

494
00:22:59,987 --> 00:23:01,423
I just want what's best for you.

495
00:23:01,509 --> 00:23:03,556
I said, forget it.

496
00:23:03,643 --> 00:23:06,253
You want what's best for me,
stay out of my personal life.

497
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:07,951
It's best for us.

498
00:23:08,038 --> 00:23:10,563
Liza.

499
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:21,095
Liza.

500
00:23:21,182 --> 00:23:23,009
Leaving so soon?

501
00:23:23,096 --> 00:23:24,228
Quinn.

502
00:23:24,315 --> 00:23:25,466
Congratulations
on your big night.

503
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:26,491
I've got somewhere to be.

504
00:23:26,578 --> 00:23:28,929
Is that all you want to say?

505
00:23:29,016 --> 00:23:30,496
Excuse me?

506
00:23:30,583 --> 00:23:31,908
The next time you
investigate me,

507
00:23:31,932 --> 00:23:33,517
you might want to
double-check your sources.

508
00:23:33,541 --> 00:23:35,587
I was doing my due
diligence as an editor

509
00:23:35,674 --> 00:23:37,502
when I fact-checked your book.

510
00:23:37,589 --> 00:23:39,026
It's my job.

511
00:23:39,113 --> 00:23:40,872
Is it also your job to
spread rumors about me

512
00:23:40,896 --> 00:23:42,724
to my own boyfriend?

513
00:23:42,811 --> 00:23:44,248
It wasn't a rumor.

514
00:23:44,335 --> 00:23:46,511
I spoke with your
former campaign manager.

515
00:23:46,598 --> 00:23:48,557
Former?

516
00:23:48,644 --> 00:23:51,167
No, she still works for me.

517
00:23:51,255 --> 00:23:52,734
And you better believe

518
00:23:52,822 --> 00:23:54,103
when I do announce
my run for governor,

519
00:23:54,127 --> 00:23:56,739
it's not gonna be at a
two-bit book party like this.

520
00:23:56,826 --> 00:23:58,480
You set me up?

521
00:23:58,567 --> 00:24:00,089
You set yourself up.

522
00:24:00,176 --> 00:24:02,092
You act like you're
trying to protect Charles.

523
00:24:02,179 --> 00:24:04,834
All you are doing is hurting him

524
00:24:04,921 --> 00:24:05,965
by holding on.

525
00:24:06,053 --> 00:24:07,489
- I didn't...
- No, no.

526
00:24:07,576 --> 00:24:09,317
No need for rebuttal.

527
00:24:09,403 --> 00:24:10,710
Good night.

528
00:24:22,548 --> 00:24:25,420
Glad you stayed over last night.

529
00:24:25,507 --> 00:24:29,118
I'm sorry about all the crying.
She's not usually that fussy.

530
00:24:29,205 --> 00:24:31,164
No worries.

531
00:24:31,251 --> 00:24:33,210
Although, the decibel
levels were pretty close

532
00:24:33,297 --> 00:24:34,994
to a Floaty V concert,

533
00:24:35,082 --> 00:24:36,778
so you might have a
pop star on your hands.

534
00:24:36,865 --> 00:24:38,388
Hey, now.

535
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:39,913
Hey, maybe you could
be her manager.

536
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,609
- Oh.

537
00:24:41,697 --> 00:24:44,177
She does really like you.

538
00:24:44,265 --> 00:24:46,572
Yeah.

539
00:24:46,659 --> 00:24:49,313
About that.

540
00:24:51,402 --> 00:24:52,882
Mm-hmm?

541
00:24:52,969 --> 00:24:55,363
She's great, Josh.

542
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:57,146
You're great.

543
00:24:57,233 --> 00:24:58,887
But?

544
00:24:58,974 --> 00:25:02,848
But I'm not ready for the whole

545
00:25:02,935 --> 00:25:05,328
insta-family thing.

546
00:25:05,415 --> 00:25:09,508
It's just more than I
can handle right now.

547
00:25:09,595 --> 00:25:11,596
I'm sorry.

548
00:25:11,683 --> 00:25:15,164
I wish I would've said
something sooner, but...

549
00:25:15,251 --> 00:25:17,166
I don't know. I was just

550
00:25:17,253 --> 00:25:18,907
was having so much fun with you.

551
00:25:18,994 --> 00:25:22,564
And I always had so
much fun with you.

552
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:30,049
Oh, and...

553
00:25:30,136 --> 00:25:33,182
Do you mind if I
hang on to this?

554
00:25:33,269 --> 00:25:35,142
It was kind of
sexy for a minute.

555
00:25:35,229 --> 00:25:37,797
Plus, I have a 16-hour
flight to Osaka on Friday.

556
00:25:37,884 --> 00:25:40,407
Uh, yeah. Sure.

557
00:25:40,494 --> 00:25:43,977
Thanks, and um

558
00:25:44,064 --> 00:25:45,805
good luck with everything.

559
00:25:45,892 --> 00:25:48,198
You, too.

560
00:25:50,417 --> 00:25:52,768
Bye, Gemma.

561
00:25:52,855 --> 00:25:54,552
- All right.
- Bye.

562
00:25:57,643 --> 00:25:59,949
Hey.

563
00:26:00,036 --> 00:26:02,125
If I would've told you sooner,

564
00:26:02,211 --> 00:26:05,346
would it have made a difference?

565
00:26:05,432 --> 00:26:08,392
Maybe.

566
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:28,934
So, it's a literary party.

567
00:26:29,021 --> 00:26:30,153
It's not a party.

568
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,505
INKubator is a
salon-meets-speakeasy.

569
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:36,855
Or a writers' workshop,
but underground.

570
00:26:36,942 --> 00:26:39,815
It's a source for
raw, untapped talent.

571
00:26:39,902 --> 00:26:42,688
And Liza found the
gem of the bunch.

572
00:26:42,775 --> 00:26:45,038
And the best part is, the
book's already written.

573
00:26:45,125 --> 00:26:46,778
I know everyone is always saying

574
00:26:46,865 --> 00:26:48,127
blank is the new Joan Didion,

575
00:26:48,214 --> 00:26:50,304
but this girl actually might be.

576
00:26:50,391 --> 00:26:53,567
She sounds like a great choice.

577
00:26:53,654 --> 00:26:56,266
For another publisher.

578
00:26:56,353 --> 00:26:59,313
Right now we are
focused on blockbusters.

579
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,270
It's not the time
for literary fiction.

580
00:27:01,357 --> 00:27:02,837
Seriously?

581
00:27:02,924 --> 00:27:04,578
You're not even
gonna read the book?

582
00:27:04,665 --> 00:27:07,103
The board will be reluctant
to disrupt a proven formula.

583
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:09,671
Chicago wants best sellers.

584
00:27:09,758 --> 00:27:12,805
James Patterson charts
higher than literary debuts.

585
00:27:12,892 --> 00:27:14,196
It's business.

586
00:27:14,284 --> 00:27:16,025
And I'm sorry.

587
00:27:16,112 --> 00:27:17,481
Sounds like you've already
taken a personal interest

588
00:27:17,505 --> 00:27:20,073
in her.

589
00:27:29,909 --> 00:27:31,953
No, you're right.

590
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:34,521
This isn't the right
fit for Empirical.

591
00:27:34,608 --> 00:27:36,219
If Millennial was
still the flagship,

592
00:27:36,306 --> 00:27:38,568
we probably wouldn't even
be asking for approval.

593
00:27:38,656 --> 00:27:42,442
Millennial loved nothing more
than young, green authors,

594
00:27:42,529 --> 00:27:45,010
but this is Empirical, isn't it?

595
00:27:46,751 --> 00:27:48,275
It is.

596
00:27:48,362 --> 00:27:50,145
Right.

597
00:27:50,232 --> 00:27:53,019
We humbly withdraw our proposal.

598
00:27:53,105 --> 00:27:55,368
Apologies for wasting your time.

599
00:27:55,455 --> 00:27:58,285
Kelsey.

600
00:28:02,244 --> 00:28:03,420
Hey.

601
00:28:03,507 --> 00:28:05,901
Hey, what was that?

602
00:28:05,988 --> 00:28:08,382
You totally flipped
the script on me.

603
00:28:08,469 --> 00:28:10,210
- We could have convinced him.
- I know.

604
00:28:10,297 --> 00:28:12,211
I'm sorry, but that
wasn't me giving up.

605
00:28:12,298 --> 00:28:14,953
Dylan is our author.
She deserves better.

606
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,606
Our author.

607
00:28:16,694 --> 00:28:18,871
INKubator can't offer
someone a book deal.

608
00:28:18,958 --> 00:28:21,221
I know, but talking about how

609
00:28:21,307 --> 00:28:22,827
it's this incredible
wellspring for us,

610
00:28:22,875 --> 00:28:26,400
something that we
built on our own, felt,

611
00:28:26,487 --> 00:28:28,750
so familiar.

612
00:28:28,836 --> 00:28:29,969
It felt like Millennial.

613
00:28:30,056 --> 00:28:32,144
I don't have a plan. Yet.

614
00:28:32,231 --> 00:28:35,278
But I'll work on it. We will.

615
00:28:35,365 --> 00:28:37,498
Right?

616
00:28:37,585 --> 00:28:39,500
You know, you're kinda my hero.

617
00:28:58,258 --> 00:28:59,626
I think it's time
that I actually buy

618
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:01,391
my own apartment
in New York City.

619
00:29:01,478 --> 00:29:03,238
Check out the broker
you'll be working with.

620
00:29:03,262 --> 00:29:04,873
A woman who knows
what she wants.

621
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,590
Sometimes, I think she
should just outsource

622
00:29:06,614 --> 00:29:08,223
if I don't satisfy her.

623
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:09,898
But then I think about
the two of 'em together,

624
00:29:09,922 --> 00:29:11,531
I wanna kill 'em both.

625
00:29:11,618 --> 00:29:13,597
You remember my novel
about the affair that I had

626
00:29:13,621 --> 00:29:16,015
with an older woman after
I graduated from college?

627
00:29:16,102 --> 00:29:18,625
My past is coming
back to haunt me.

628
00:29:18,712 --> 00:29:20,453
After all our history together,

629
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:22,064
you owe us that.

630
00:29:22,151 --> 00:29:24,326
Things don't always
turn out as planned.

631
00:29:24,413 --> 00:29:25,807
Is he my son?

631
00:29:26,305 --> 00:30:26,767
