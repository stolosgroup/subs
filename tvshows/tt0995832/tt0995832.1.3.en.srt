<i>I want a station at 30 mikes,

<i>Solid copy on checkin.

8
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:29,526
Have all the other drivers
fill up the fleet together.

9
00:02:29,932 --> 00:02:32,210
Check the air filter on that Humvee.

10
00:02:33,397 --> 00:02:35,364
Ampusel, grab me a donkey dick.

11
00:02:35,815 --> 00:02:38,101
- These damn runflats.
- Dirty Earl!

12
00:02:38,221 --> 00:02:41,369
I can fix anything from a screen door
to a broken heart.

13
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,270
Trombley, did you eat?

14
00:02:45,094 --> 00:02:46,046
Yes, Sergeant.

15
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,876
- You hydrated?
- Yes, Sergeant.

16
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,920
- Have you defecated?
- No, Sergeant.

17
00:02:51,081 --> 00:02:53,537
- Fuck!
- Trombley, we have a long day ahead of us.

18
00:02:53,657 --> 00:02:56,634
I need you to take a dump now
before we get on the road.

19
00:02:56,796 --> 00:03:00,785
- Before you shit, hand me the bolt cutters.
- Outstanding job yesterday, gentlemen.

20
00:03:02,526 --> 00:03:04,534
Can I help you with something, Gunny?

21
00:03:04,654 --> 00:03:05,613
Sergeant,

22
00:03:06,005 --> 00:03:07,813
yesterday we had a trial by fire.

23
00:03:09,152 --> 00:03:12,035
I want you to know, Brad,
that I'm here for you and your men.

24
00:03:12,155 --> 00:03:12,656
Come on!

25
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:15,737
Are there any combat stress reactions
anyone needs to talk about?

26
00:03:16,652 --> 00:03:17,547
Remember,

27
00:03:17,667 --> 00:03:19,782
I'm the certified
combat stress instructor.

28
00:03:19,965 --> 00:03:20,915
Fuck, fuck!

29
00:03:21,341 --> 00:03:22,535
It did it again.

30
00:03:23,402 --> 00:03:24,952
No, we're good, Gunny.

31
00:03:25,529 --> 00:03:26,665
But we would be  lot better

32
00:03:26,825 --> 00:03:29,344
if you were getting us
the gun lube and batteries we need.

33
00:03:29,464 --> 00:03:31,294
That might do it for my combat stress.

34
00:03:31,715 --> 00:03:32,965
Yeah, mine too!

35
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,160
Dirty Earl, you up for worm dirt?

36
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,909
Why didn't you do it first?

37
00:03:38,029 --> 00:03:41,219
- I don't know, Sarge.
- Rudy, you havn'tin't got no goddamn got any common sense.

38
00:03:41,339 --> 00:03:44,098
- I know, brother.
- Sgt, the spare caught a bullet too.

39
00:03:44,218 --> 00:03:46,630
- Fuck!
- Ready to kill, gunnery sir.

40
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,270
Stay hard, James.

41
00:03:50,268 --> 00:03:54,241
That's where it's hanging up. I get off
maybe 10 rounds before it jams.

42
00:03:55,403 --> 00:03:58,325
This shit is totally ineffective
in these conditions.

43
00:03:58,445 --> 00:03:59,685
We need L.S.A.

44
00:04:00,515 --> 00:04:01,703
Lieutenant.

45
00:04:02,718 --> 00:04:06,068
Sir, the main weapon
on your point vehicle is unreliable.

46
00:04:06,341 --> 00:04:09,596
Given the prevailing climatic
conditions, using this lubricant

47
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:13,711
is like trying to buttfuck a virgin
underaged phutak whore with chalk...

48
00:04:14,343 --> 00:04:16,089
when KY is clearly called for, sir.

49
00:04:18,403 --> 00:04:20,036
You'll have to deal with it, Sergeant.

50
00:04:20,156 --> 00:04:22,178
We have four more towns
to assault through today.

51
00:04:25,914 --> 00:04:28,117
You want logistics, join the army.

52
00:04:28,408 --> 00:04:29,658
Marines make do.

53
00:04:31,517 --> 00:04:33,774
Marines, I just want you to know,

54
00:04:33,935 --> 00:04:35,775
the company commander feels that it was our team

55
00:04:35,937 --> 00:04:38,069
that scored the touchdown yesterday
for Godfather.

56
00:04:41,332 --> 00:04:44,117
Of course Godfather's happy. He's trying
to get his full bird on our backs.

57
00:04:44,393 --> 00:04:46,244
At least I got to bust my cherry.

58
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:49,338
My point is we gotta follow Godfather
wherever he leads,

59
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:51,258
no matter how fucked up
it happens to be.

60
00:04:51,378 --> 00:04:53,020
- Sure do.
- Stafford,

61
00:04:54,501 --> 00:04:56,963
yesterday we ran the gauntlet
with no ass and no air,

62
00:04:57,559 --> 00:04:58,644
and for what?

63
00:04:59,373 --> 00:05:03,052
Fuckin' artillery blew the shit outta
that town after we rolled through it.

64
00:05:03,581 --> 00:05:05,138
We're reconnaissance Marines.

65
00:05:05,707 --> 00:05:06,962
Swift, silent and deadly.

66
00:05:07,709 --> 00:05:09,459
And Godfather knows this.

67
00:05:09,889 --> 00:05:12,303
And he knows when he sends us
into the shit, like yesterday,

68
00:05:12,423 --> 00:05:14,519
we'll probably come out on top.

69
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:17,069
'cause we're the best.

70
00:05:19,289 --> 00:05:20,711
But that don't make it right.

71
00:05:21,686 --> 00:05:24,182
Beaver Hunter, why are you even here?

72
00:05:25,645 --> 00:05:29,644
I mean, After yesterday any cognizant person
with a speck of common sense

73
00:05:29,764 --> 00:05:32,339
would have caught the first truck south.

74
00:05:34,494 --> 00:05:35,410
Thanks.

75
00:05:37,915 --> 00:05:39,734
Yo, son, you shit on my shitter.

76
00:05:41,168 --> 00:05:43,125
Just wipe it off or something.

77
00:05:43,899 --> 00:05:47,199
Trombley, this shitter's
the only luxury I got out here!

78
00:05:51,327 --> 00:05:52,535
Screwby.

79
00:05:55,247 --> 00:05:57,491
Devil dog, your aim sucks.

80
00:05:59,123 --> 00:06:02,035
Pappy, if lance Corporal Trombley's
as good with his saw

81
00:06:02,155 --> 00:06:05,500
as he is with his shitter,
I think team one has issues.

82
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,328
Is it correct to surmise
from your sitrep, sir,

83
00:06:10,489 --> 00:06:13,216
that we're gonna be rolling through
these towns with a lot of ass today?

84
00:06:13,336 --> 00:06:14,416
Yes, Captain.

85
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:16,793
We got kudos directly
from General Mattis, I might add,

86
00:06:17,374 --> 00:06:19,962
for punching through yesterday
where R.C.T. 1 failed to go.

87
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:23,123
But now it looks like we're back
to being one unit among many.

88
00:06:23,243 --> 00:06:26,793
And unfortunately, when we're rolling
with the regimental combat team,

89
00:06:26,913 --> 00:06:29,180
we can get lost
in the middle of all that ass.

90
00:06:29,551 --> 00:06:31,641
The only way
we're gonna get back into the game

91
00:06:31,925 --> 00:06:35,275
and score like we did yesterday
is to find another mission

92
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:36,871
where we can break off.

93
00:06:36,991 --> 00:06:38,190
And, Captain Patterson,

94
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:39,858
you can depend on Godfather

95
00:06:40,019 --> 00:06:42,527
to look for any opportunity
to get us back into the game.

96
00:06:42,688 --> 00:06:43,850
Count on it.

97
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,259
Now, gentlemen,

98
00:06:45,911 --> 00:06:47,495
keep your powder dry.

99
00:06:52,473 --> 00:06:54,323
I have a present for you.

100
00:06:55,366 --> 00:06:56,166
L.S.A.

101
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:59,188
Scammed some off the guys in R.C.T. 1.

102
00:06:59,489 --> 00:07:01,877
Sir, not to get homoerotic about this,

103
00:07:02,548 --> 00:07:04,184
but I could kiss ya.

104
00:07:05,803 --> 00:07:06,603
Walt!

105
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:12,085
Get that mark19 properly lubed.

106
00:07:12,804 --> 00:07:15,854
Now we're talking
about killing some motherfuckers.

107
00:07:20,309 --> 00:07:23,716
Matt, hurry up and get off
the fucking dirt. We gotta go.

108
00:07:32,569 --> 00:07:34,856
This place gives me the creeps.

109
00:07:34,976 --> 00:07:36,624
Yeah, those guys waving at us

110
00:07:36,744 --> 00:07:40,094
are probably the same ones
who tried to kill us yesterday.

111
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:48,355
Damn, homes.

112
00:07:48,636 --> 00:07:49,635
Hit with R.P.Gs

113
00:07:50,745 --> 00:07:52,431
Yeah, a buddy of mine in one seven

114
00:07:52,551 --> 00:07:55,584
had to fucking clean up a Humvee
that got hit like that.

115
00:07:55,704 --> 00:07:59,482
Said he found the driver's fingers
in the engine compartment.

116
00:08:00,558 --> 00:08:03,208
How did they know
they were the driver's fingers?

117
00:08:03,369 --> 00:08:06,235
'cause they were still gripping
the steering wheel, fucknuts.

118
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,828
We oughta shoot some of these dogs.

119
00:08:17,682 --> 00:08:20,249
Trombley, I keep telling you
we don't shoot dogs.

120
00:08:20,681 --> 00:08:21,931
We shoot people.

121
00:08:22,371 --> 00:08:25,321
And we Generally only shoot people
if we have to.

122
00:08:27,998 --> 00:08:29,392
I'm afraid of dogs.

123
00:08:29,685 --> 00:08:30,843
You're afraid of dogs?

124
00:08:31,156 --> 00:08:33,012
What, Were you bitten in your formative years?

125
00:08:36,397 --> 00:08:37,857
My dad was once.

126
00:08:39,176 --> 00:08:40,562
The dog bit him

127
00:08:40,723 --> 00:08:43,048
and my dad jammed his hand
down the dog's throat,

128
00:08:43,168 --> 00:08:45,024
ripped up his fucking stomach.

129
00:08:47,982 --> 00:08:50,032
Where did we find this guy, man?

130
00:08:52,563 --> 00:08:53,631
I like cats.

131
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:34,360
Remember how the kids would come
running out to us in Afghanistan?

132
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:37,074
<i>- Yeah.
- Hitman, this is Hitman Two.</i>

133
00:09:37,194 --> 00:09:40,212
<i>Eyes on the village
confirms no enemy presence.</i>

134
00:09:40,658 --> 00:09:42,208
Captain America, brah.

135
00:09:43,244 --> 00:09:45,994
Winning the war
one souvenir at a time, right?

136
00:09:46,172 --> 00:09:47,016
Shit,

137
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:49,089
- get that on video?
- Fuck yeah.

138
00:09:49,342 --> 00:09:50,973
Fucking scumbag, man.

139
00:09:52,878 --> 00:09:54,661
That's Bravo Three's commander.

140
00:09:59,957 --> 00:10:01,145
Check it out.

141
00:10:02,138 --> 00:10:03,088
Sergeant!

142
00:10:04,098 --> 00:10:06,179
For the life of me,
I could only find a black one.

143
00:10:06,299 --> 00:10:08,028
Have you located any red ones?

144
00:10:08,298 --> 00:10:09,148
No, sir.

145
00:10:10,551 --> 00:10:12,753
If you do,
you'll be sure to let me know?

146
00:10:12,873 --> 00:10:13,836
Yes, sir.

147
00:10:22,486 --> 00:10:23,994
P.F.C. Christeson,

148
00:10:24,941 --> 00:10:28,540
how far do you make it from the berm
to the edge of that hut?

149
00:10:31,552 --> 00:10:32,902
About 100 meters.

150
00:10:33,551 --> 00:10:34,351
120.

151
00:10:35,239 --> 00:10:36,089
Not bad.

152
00:10:38,175 --> 00:10:39,125
About 225.

153
00:10:40,052 --> 00:10:41,947
- See that beehiveshaped thing?
- Yeah.

154
00:10:42,067 --> 00:10:43,745
That's where they cook their bread.

155
00:10:43,865 --> 00:10:45,686
It's always gonna show hot in a thermal.

156
00:10:48,517 --> 00:10:50,339
It's all about the windows
and doors, man.

157
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:51,985
Entrances and exits.

158
00:10:52,674 --> 00:10:53,524
Screwby.

159
00:10:54,864 --> 00:10:55,680
Brad?

160
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,448
Yeah?

161
00:10:57,679 --> 00:10:58,629
I'm, uh...

162
00:11:00,865 --> 00:11:03,328
concerned about Captain America.

163
00:11:08,059 --> 00:11:09,419
Those guys are with R.C.T. 1.

164
00:11:09,579 --> 00:11:11,639
- Move, move, move!
- What the fuck?

165
00:11:13,407 --> 00:11:15,594
We don't have comms for that unit.

166
00:11:16,906 --> 00:11:18,912
Fuck, that's women and children.

167
00:11:19,032 --> 00:11:19,887
Cease fire!

168
00:11:22,235 --> 00:11:23,221
Cease fire!

169
00:11:24,219 --> 00:11:26,560
- Do not engage.
- Hold your fire, hold your fire!

170
00:11:30,972 --> 00:11:34,122
All Hitman Victors,
we've been observing this hamlet.

171
00:11:34,283 --> 00:11:36,153
It's only women and children.

172
00:11:36,315 --> 00:11:37,465
Do not engage.

173
00:11:38,109 --> 00:11:39,949
Sir, they're shooting
that hamlet in error!

174
00:11:41,463 --> 00:11:43,370
Sir, we don't have any comms
with R.C.T. 1

175
00:11:43,531 --> 00:11:45,300
and they're shooting
that hamlet in error!

176
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,455
<i>Laser on.</i>

177
00:11:46,904 --> 00:11:47,997
<i>Spot.</i>

178
00:11:48,376 --> 00:11:50,885
<i>Range 71 is at heading 030.</i>

179
00:11:51,005 --> 00:11:52,155
<i>Link them up.</i>

180
00:11:52,439 --> 00:11:53,501
<i>Cleared hot.</i>

181
00:11:53,621 --> 00:11:55,132
<i>71, missile away.</i>

182
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:01,129
<i>Hitman Two, this is Hitman Two two.</i>

183
00:12:01,252 --> 00:12:02,721
<i>Who cleared that helo hot?</i>

184
00:12:03,251 --> 00:12:06,242
<i>This is Hitman Two.
Nothing on our nets. Over.</i>

185
00:12:06,845 --> 00:12:07,882
<i>Interrogative:</i>

186
00:12:08,002 --> 00:12:11,189
<i>does anyone have positive I.D.
on enemy personnel there?</i>

187
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,572
<i>Unaware at this time. Over.</i>

188
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:16,142
<i>Range 71 is off left, addressing south.</i>

189
00:12:16,316 --> 00:12:17,866
<i>Standing by for B.D.A.</i>

190
00:12:18,706 --> 00:12:21,156
They fucking got good effect on target.

191
00:12:21,459 --> 00:12:24,785
<i>Range 71 copies.
Good effects, one building destroyed.</i>

192
00:12:30,895 --> 00:12:31,695
Dip?

193
00:12:32,832 --> 00:12:33,982
Yeah, thanks.

194
00:12:36,457 --> 00:12:37,471
Dawg,

195
00:12:38,121 --> 00:12:41,768
we was like, 13 or 14
and we were pedaling around

196
00:12:41,888 --> 00:12:44,757
in this neighborhood I grew up in,
just east of L.A.

197
00:12:45,023 --> 00:12:46,765
We saw some cholos from another hood.

198
00:12:47,831 --> 00:12:50,277
And we thought we was all
hard gangbanger wannabes.

199
00:12:50,397 --> 00:12:52,855
So we started saying, "Fuck off, yo!
"Fuck off,"

200
00:12:53,148 --> 00:12:55,946
throwing and flashing signs
to them and stuff.

201
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:58,525
So they started throwing down on us.

202
00:12:58,645 --> 00:13:00,029
Kicking our little asses.

203
00:13:00,521 --> 00:13:03,287
Then some of the older dawgs
from our hood come out,

204
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:06,285
grab those fools,
took one behind the tastee freez...

205
00:13:07,758 --> 00:13:09,705
They stabbed him up with a screwdriver.

206
00:13:11,275 --> 00:13:12,625
Killed the cholo.

207
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:15,781
See, Generally white people,

208
00:13:16,652 --> 00:13:18,645
they don't drag a dude
behind the tastee freez

209
00:13:18,765 --> 00:13:20,925
and stab him to death
with a screwdriver.

210
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:23,433
So after that day I decided.

211
00:13:24,424 --> 00:13:26,455
I'm gonna hang with white people.

212
00:13:27,538 --> 00:13:28,682
Well, here you are.

213
00:13:29,383 --> 00:13:30,142
Chaffin!

214
00:13:30,459 --> 00:13:31,409
Excuse me.

215
00:13:32,212 --> 00:13:33,362
Chaffin...

216
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:36,440
Did you get a picture
of my girlfriend from Leon?

217
00:13:36,978 --> 00:13:37,983
I don't think so.

218
00:13:38,709 --> 00:13:40,569
Straight blonde hair, brown eyes?

219
00:13:41,796 --> 00:13:43,948
She have a big stain on her face?

220
00:13:47,323 --> 00:13:48,752
Haven't seen her.

221
00:13:50,956 --> 00:13:51,756
Poke!

222
00:14:00,642 --> 00:14:03,392
This town Ar Rifa
runs right up on the M.S.R.

223
00:14:03,512 --> 00:14:06,429
for two kliks.
Must be 75,000 people in it.

224
00:14:06,954 --> 00:14:09,236
Our mission is to haul ass past it.

225
00:14:09,543 --> 00:14:10,495
After that,

226
00:14:10,615 --> 00:14:12,056
what's next, sir?

227
00:14:12,305 --> 00:14:13,686
Haul ass through the next one,

228
00:14:13,806 --> 00:14:15,837
hope the Iraqis keep their heads down.

229
00:14:15,957 --> 00:14:17,314
Sir, in that last hamlet,

230
00:14:18,055 --> 00:14:19,609
all it took was one shot.

231
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:23,112
That was just an undisciplined grunt
from R.C.T. One.

232
00:14:23,355 --> 00:14:25,322
Everybody opened up and
schwacked it over nothing.

233
00:14:27,392 --> 00:14:29,209
We could only keep
our own on it clean, dawg.

234
00:14:29,329 --> 00:14:32,037
What these other motherfuckers
do in this big wide A-O ain't on us.

235
00:14:32,395 --> 00:14:35,605
Yeah, it's hard enough just
keeping our own guys out of the shit.

236
00:14:35,725 --> 00:14:37,650
We can't e worrying
about the rest of the world.

237
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:39,460
I know you all saw our own C.O.

238
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,630
try to fire off a 203 round
in the middle of all that.

239
00:14:42,205 --> 00:14:44,211
- Fucking Encino man.
- But he missed though.

240
00:14:44,331 --> 00:14:47,181
- Badly.
- Look, Brad, can't live in the past.

241
00:14:48,591 --> 00:14:50,041
You need to snap to.

242
00:14:50,391 --> 00:14:52,399
We got a lot of shit ahead of us.

243
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:53,769
Roger that, sir.

244
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:56,590
Mount up!

245
00:15:17,492 --> 00:15:20,870
<i>All Hitman Two Victors,
quick hold to Herringbone. Break.</i>

246
00:15:21,203 --> 00:15:22,630
<i>Hitman Three has fallen behind.</i>

247
00:15:23,598 --> 00:15:25,561
<i>Hitman Two, Two One Bravo set.</i>

248
00:15:26,377 --> 00:15:27,616
<i>Two Two, set.</i>

249
00:15:53,173 --> 00:15:54,478
How'd that line go?

250
00:15:54,598 --> 00:15:55,511
Q- Tip!

251
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:56,752
What?

252
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:59,122
Looks like Two men in black pajamas,

253
00:15:59,621 --> 00:16:01,733
creeping along at our nine o'clock.

254
00:16:01,853 --> 00:16:04,089
- 200 meters.
- Are they armed?

255
00:16:06,245 --> 00:16:07,311
I think so.

256
00:16:07,809 --> 00:16:09,252
Should I light them up?

257
00:16:09,372 --> 00:16:10,372
Yo, Gunny!

258
00:16:10,789 --> 00:16:13,001
Christeson's got two foot-mobiles,
maybe with weapons.

259
00:16:13,121 --> 00:16:14,306
200 meters to our 9 o'clock.

260
00:16:14,467 --> 00:16:17,294
If they got weapons,
light them the fuck up.

261
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,904
<i>Hitman Two Three, this is Two One.</i>

262
00:16:26,024 --> 00:16:28,308
<i>Interrogative: what are we engaging?</i>

263
00:16:28,943 --> 00:16:31,268
<i>Hitman Two One, this is Two Three...</i>

264
00:16:32,006 --> 00:16:33,813
You're shooting too high.

265
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:39,348
- There you go.
- Bravo Three is ready to push.

266
00:16:39,468 --> 00:16:40,907
We're Oscar Mike.

267
00:16:41,313 --> 00:16:43,321
- Let's go, guys.
- Bataillon is rolling.

268
00:16:43,524 --> 00:16:46,213
- Maintain suppressive fire.
- Let's go, let's go!

269
00:16:46,483 --> 00:16:47,484
Mount up!

270
00:16:48,454 --> 00:16:49,401
Go go go!

271
00:16:52,259 --> 00:16:54,111
Hitman, this is Hitman Two.

272
00:16:54,231 --> 00:16:56,349
Our command Victor's made contact
with an R.P.G. team.

273
00:16:56,509 --> 00:16:58,634
We have engaged them. How copy?

274
00:17:00,231 --> 00:17:02,151
Let's go! We're Oscar Mike!

275
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:03,301
Mount up!

276
00:17:04,452 --> 00:17:05,438
Go go!

277
00:17:10,098 --> 00:17:11,284
You know what?

278
00:17:11,404 --> 00:17:13,500
We were just fighting actual guerrillas.

279
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:16,201
- Screwby!
- Hitman, Hitman, this is Hitman Two.

280
00:17:16,362 --> 00:17:17,760
Do you copy? Over.

281
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:27,515
<i>Hitman, Hitman, this is Hitman Two.</i>

282
00:17:27,635 --> 00:17:30,617
<i>We've suppressed an R.P.G. team.
How copy? Over.</i>

283
00:17:37,421 --> 00:17:39,502
<i>Hitman Actual, this is Assassin Actual.</i>

284
00:17:39,622 --> 00:17:43,172
<i>Be advised we are taking inaccurate fire
from the northeast.</i>

285
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:46,690
Hitman, Hitman, this is Hitman Two.
Do you copy? Over.

286
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,828
- Son of a bitch!
- Why are they stopping?

287
00:18:01,201 --> 00:18:01,999
Fuck.

288
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:12,997
Why the fuck did you stop?

289
00:18:13,117 --> 00:18:15,462
Bravo Three got an order from Hitman.

290
00:18:15,582 --> 00:18:17,712
I didn't receive any such order.

291
00:18:18,314 --> 00:18:20,182
Sir, this is contrary to our S.O.P.

292
00:18:20,917 --> 00:18:22,726
We're bunched up in the open,

293
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:25,437
and that town is definitely hostile.

294
00:18:25,557 --> 00:18:28,051
Hitman, this is Hitman Two. Do you copy?

295
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:31,329
Damn it, Hitman's not on comms.

296
00:18:32,377 --> 00:18:35,459
Do you have any information, Sergeant?
Why aren't we in a defensive position?

297
00:18:35,579 --> 00:18:37,658
All I know is that Hitman
ordered my platoon to stop.

298
00:18:37,987 --> 00:18:39,409
This is his goat rodie.

299
00:18:39,935 --> 00:18:41,703
Jesus Christ, Nate! You're alive.

300
00:18:42,499 --> 00:18:44,130
Dave, what the fuck is going on?

301
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,333
You were taken out by an R.P.G. team.

302
00:18:46,495 --> 00:18:47,860
Gunny Wynn's dead.

303
00:18:48,273 --> 00:18:49,696
If you need a ride, Nate,

304
00:18:49,816 --> 00:18:50,939
<i>mi casa es su casa.</i>

305
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:54,170
We've stopped based on an erroneous
report. No One in Bravo Two was hit.

306
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:55,819
Hell are we doing here?

307
00:18:55,939 --> 00:18:58,502
This is the type of Vietnam shit
gets a whole company wiped out.

308
00:18:58,622 --> 00:19:01,318
Sir, I'm worried that there are people
in that ville

309
00:19:01,438 --> 00:19:03,559
trying to organize a mass R.P.G. attack
against us.

310
00:19:03,883 --> 00:19:05,756
I think my concerns are reasonable.

311
00:19:05,876 --> 00:19:07,677
Sir, dDo you want us
to set up a sniper position?

312
00:19:07,797 --> 00:19:08,910
Nate? Nate?

313
00:19:09,437 --> 00:19:12,061
Sir, do you want us
to set up a sniper position?

314
00:19:12,181 --> 00:19:14,319
Push security out farther.
Let's make the best of this.

315
00:19:14,439 --> 00:19:16,995
- I'm gonna find the Captain.
- Punch out 20!

316
00:19:17,115 --> 00:19:20,281
- Leon, Christopher, punch out 20!
- Go go go go!

317
00:19:25,984 --> 00:19:28,412
I'm gonna call this one in right now.

318
00:19:28,989 --> 00:19:31,760
Sir, that's a cunt hair
over 200 meters, sir.

319
00:19:32,378 --> 00:19:34,528
That's danger-close for artillery.

320
00:19:35,984 --> 00:19:37,147
Danger-close?

321
00:19:42,693 --> 00:19:43,534
Sir,

322
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:46,187
"danger-close" is an artillery strike

323
00:19:46,307 --> 00:19:48,812
within 600 meters
of a friendly position.

324
00:19:48,974 --> 00:19:50,324
That would be us.

325
00:19:50,624 --> 00:19:51,774
200 meters...

326
00:19:53,127 --> 00:19:55,577
That's pretty much on top of our heads.

327
00:20:00,646 --> 00:20:01,822
Dumb motherfucker, sir.

328
00:20:01,942 --> 00:20:03,994
Even the most boot-fucked marine
knows danger-close.

329
00:20:04,156 --> 00:20:06,269
- You're way outta line.
- Skipper!

330
00:20:06,389 --> 00:20:09,871
What the fuck is going on here?
You weren't on your comms!

331
00:20:10,092 --> 00:20:11,460
I'm calling in a fire mission.

332
00:20:13,188 --> 00:20:15,825
Sir, I don't like this. These two
get their fucking heads together

333
00:20:15,945 --> 00:20:17,598
it's fucking dangerous!

334
00:20:18,002 --> 00:20:19,539
It's the oldest play in the book...

335
00:20:19,659 --> 00:20:22,570
Officers calling in danger-close
fire missions to get medals.

336
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:25,133
Lieutenant Fick, you need to square
these shitbirds away.

337
00:20:25,253 --> 00:20:26,767
You need to N.J.P. that man.

338
00:20:26,942 --> 00:20:29,392
Tell me exactly what you're doing.

339
00:20:29,566 --> 00:20:32,356
I'm calling in a fire mission
on a hunter-killer R.P.G. team.

340
00:20:32,518 --> 00:20:35,318
There is no R.P.G. team.
I called it in. My men destroyed it.

341
00:20:35,438 --> 00:20:38,005
Lieutenant, it doesn't matter
if we're right or wrong.

342
00:20:38,245 --> 00:20:40,009
You and your men can't disobey orders.

343
00:20:40,129 --> 00:20:42,593
An officer who does needs
to be relieved of his command!

344
00:20:42,713 --> 00:20:43,477
Sir,

345
00:20:43,597 --> 00:20:45,711
I'm merely trying to pass you
accurate information.

346
00:20:45,831 --> 00:20:48,163
There is no hunter-killer R.P.G. team.

347
00:20:51,317 --> 00:20:52,989
What is your order, sir?

348
00:20:53,853 --> 00:20:55,295
I'm calling in a fire mission...

349
00:20:55,872 --> 00:20:56,966
At Papa Quebec

350
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:58,125
059...

351
00:20:58,662 --> 00:20:59,874
...098,

352
00:21:00,193 --> 00:21:01,565
038 degrees,

353
00:21:02,318 --> 00:21:03,388
200 meters.

354
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,888
Aye, sir.

355
00:21:05,049 --> 00:21:06,902
Steel Rain, Steel Rain, this is Hitman.

356
00:21:07,022 --> 00:21:08,492
Fire mission. Over.

357
00:21:09,188 --> 00:21:11,654
Sir, should we dig in
for the fire mission?

358
00:21:11,774 --> 00:21:13,452
- There won't be a fire mission. - Grid Papa Quebec...

359
00:21:13,572 --> 00:21:15,745
Hitman's using the wrong protocols.

360
00:21:15,865 --> 00:21:16,712
What?

361
00:21:18,234 --> 00:21:20,183
Hitman has the grids
all designated wrong.

362
00:21:20,303 --> 00:21:22,192
There won't be a fire mission.

363
00:21:22,312 --> 00:21:23,657
There's a switch!

364
00:21:23,777 --> 00:21:26,851
For once our asses get saved
by sheer incompetence.

365
00:21:27,142 --> 00:21:27,959
<i>Out.</i>

366
00:21:33,935 --> 00:21:35,307
<i>Hitman, this is Steel Rain.</i>

367
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:37,796
<i>Reconfirm grid zone designator.</i>

368
00:21:38,077 --> 00:21:40,304
<i>- What do you mean?
- Stand by, Hitman.</i>

369
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:42,870
<i>Break break.
Assassin, this is Steel Rain.</i>

370
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:44,560
<i>Your grid zone designators are OKcorrect.</i>

371
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,222
<i>Message to observer: Papa Uniform 149...</i>

372
00:21:47,383 --> 00:21:48,916
<i>...213 Bravo,</i>

373
00:21:49,555 --> 00:21:51,810
<i>five gun one around.
H.E. delay in effect.</i>

374
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:54,981
<i>Target number Juliet Echo November 1001.</i>

375
00:21:55,828 --> 00:21:57,486
<i>Splash in five seconds.</i>

376
00:21:58,832 --> 00:22:00,682
Five seconds to splashdown!

377
00:22:12,273 --> 00:22:14,916
- Sir, two hits...
- Suspected Ba'ath party headquarters.

378
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:20,757
That's a lot of ordinance we just
dropped in the middle of a city.

379
00:22:22,236 --> 00:22:24,654
I'm worried about civilian casualties.

380
00:22:31,455 --> 00:22:33,714
Looks like Alpha hit something
with that.

381
00:22:33,834 --> 00:22:37,795
I guess It pays to have the right protocols
when you're calling in a fire mission.

382
00:22:52,117 --> 00:22:55,123
- I don't see any muzzle flashes.
- Why do we have to see them?

383
00:22:55,522 --> 00:22:56,833
Trombley, shut up.

384
00:22:58,295 --> 00:22:59,481
I got flashes!

385
00:22:59,751 --> 00:23:00,583
Where?

386
00:23:00,974 --> 00:23:02,173
200 meters,

387
00:23:02,333 --> 00:23:03,591
my 11 o'clock.

388
00:23:04,419 --> 00:23:07,902
Second story, white building
with the sandbags on the roof.

389
00:23:08,172 --> 00:23:10,602
- Two buildings behind the roadblock.
- Yeah, got it.

390
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:12,342
His head's bobbing.

391
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:15,603
- We're cleared to engage.
- Right on, right on!

392
00:23:24,957 --> 00:23:26,670
Die, fucker, die die!

393
00:23:34,407 --> 00:23:36,569
- Nice!
- It worked, it worked!

394
00:23:37,155 --> 00:23:38,167
Damn, sucker,

395
00:23:38,477 --> 00:23:39,980
I just got some.

396
00:23:40,207 --> 00:23:42,668
Look at me, Brad. I'm a man now.

397
00:23:43,102 --> 00:23:44,277
Just like you...

398
00:23:44,397 --> 00:23:47,175
Except I don't look like a faggot
and talk all educated.

399
00:23:52,718 --> 00:23:53,932
Watch your sectors.

400
00:24:02,477 --> 00:24:04,611
Most people in America right now
probably think of Iraq

401
00:24:04,731 --> 00:24:06,027
as a dangerous country.

402
00:24:06,394 --> 00:24:08,144
Now if I were to stand up,

403
00:24:08,518 --> 00:24:09,837
I might get killed.

404
00:24:09,957 --> 00:24:10,957
But to us,

405
00:24:11,216 --> 00:24:13,519
behind this wheel, it's pretty safe.

406
00:24:13,916 --> 00:24:14,961
So to us,

407
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:17,483
Iraq is a safe country right here.

408
00:24:17,761 --> 00:24:20,119
I feel pretty safe. Do you feel safe?

409
00:24:23,394 --> 00:24:25,466
- Pretty safe, I guess.
- See?

410
00:24:25,661 --> 00:24:27,080
It's all relative.

411
00:24:35,915 --> 00:24:38,087
The natives are getting restless.

412
00:24:38,207 --> 00:24:39,716
Prayer is a good thing.

413
00:24:39,836 --> 00:24:42,527
Maybe it'll keep them too preoccupied
to shoot at us.

414
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:46,597
Sir, the scuttlebutt I'm hearing
says you may be relieved of command.

415
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,737
There could be an investigation.

416
00:24:49,566 --> 00:24:50,874
For trying to unfuck Hitman

417
00:24:50,994 --> 00:24:54,308
when he's about to drop arty
on his own fucking company?

418
00:24:54,571 --> 00:24:55,921
That's brilliant.

419
00:24:57,499 --> 00:25:01,474
Sir, your leadership is the only thing
I have absolute confidence in.

420
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:04,361
I'm assured that I'll have the right
to address any allegations

421
00:25:04,481 --> 00:25:06,213
before anything is formalized.

422
00:25:07,091 --> 00:25:08,382
I'm assured of this.

423
00:25:09,851 --> 00:25:13,095
Sir, to highlight my growing lack
of confidence in the strategic plan,

424
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,974
can you explain why we are
strong-pointing this hostile city

425
00:25:17,134 --> 00:25:19,277
in tin-plated Humvees while M-1 tanks,

426
00:25:19,397 --> 00:25:21,520
L.A.V.s and Amtracs roll past?

427
00:25:22,347 --> 00:25:24,946
Isn't it supposed to be
the other way around?

428
00:25:25,476 --> 00:25:27,706
I mean how exactly did this happen?

429
00:25:32,309 --> 00:25:34,476
You wouldn't believe it if I told you.

430
00:25:35,111 --> 00:25:37,328
Make sure to Conserve your fire.
It's gonna be a long night.

431
00:25:40,244 --> 00:25:42,041
There's no plan for this, Pap.

432
00:25:42,201 --> 00:25:43,206
For what?

433
00:25:44,427 --> 00:25:46,897
Strong-pointing a walled town
with Humvees.

434
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:50,624
It all feels so random...
What we're doing.

435
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:53,261
Running here: shooting.

436
00:25:53,614 --> 00:25:55,179
Running there: bombing.

437
00:25:55,441 --> 00:25:57,826
That might be a legit target
burning over there,

438
00:25:57,946 --> 00:25:59,350
it might be a school, Pap.

439
00:26:00,628 --> 00:26:01,949
I hope it's legit.

440
00:26:04,361 --> 00:26:06,124
I hope this is good karma.

441
00:26:16,638 --> 00:26:18,411
Everything here is ancient, Pap.

442
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:21,851
We're in an old old place.

443
00:26:24,199 --> 00:26:25,004
Yep.

444
00:26:30,542 --> 00:26:31,556
White flag.

445
00:26:35,463 --> 00:26:37,596
Could be some Habudabu trickster shit.

446
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:42,843
Let's go.

447
00:26:48,334 --> 00:26:49,392
Help please.

448
00:26:50,376 --> 00:26:51,690
- Help.
- Movin' on!

449
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:53,612
- Corpsman!
- Get the corpsman!

450
00:27:03,583 --> 00:27:05,291
Saddam... Fedayeen shoot.

451
00:27:05,884 --> 00:27:06,885
Not you.

452
00:27:07,495 --> 00:27:08,302
Saddam.

453
00:27:09,842 --> 00:27:11,380
You kill Ba'ath party...

454
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:13,206
Saddam... very good.

455
00:27:13,326 --> 00:27:14,621
Saddam in our city

456
00:27:14,993 --> 00:27:16,537
shooting at you. Not us.

457
00:27:16,657 --> 00:27:17,672
We help...

458
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:18,790
come.

459
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:20,473
- I'll show you. Come.
- Okay.

460
00:27:20,742 --> 00:27:21,742
Captain!

461
00:27:22,732 --> 00:27:23,768
Call battalion.

462
00:27:24,502 --> 00:27:26,012
Battalion's on the net.

463
00:27:26,241 --> 00:27:27,521
Godfather wants to see you.

464
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,736
Keep a handle on this till I get back.

465
00:27:34,856 --> 00:27:38,742
In Ar Rifa, this commander taught us
something about seizing the initiative.

466
00:27:39,168 --> 00:27:40,242
Earlier today,

467
00:27:40,402 --> 00:27:44,114
when his company came under attack
by fedayeen paramilitary forces,

468
00:27:44,317 --> 00:27:46,290
laying in ambush with R.P.Gs,

469
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,917
he chose to stop

470
00:27:48,077 --> 00:27:49,849
and bring the fight to them.

471
00:27:50,497 --> 00:27:52,299
- Captain Patterson, greetings.
- Sir.

472
00:27:52,419 --> 00:27:53,815
I need the translator.

473
00:27:53,935 --> 00:27:56,266
We knocked out 	he Ba'ath headquarters.
We've n opportunity...

474
00:27:56,386 --> 00:27:58,844
There's a school of thought
that says we shouldn't have stopped,

475
00:27:59,004 --> 00:28:01,786
particularly given the proximity
to a hostile city.

476
00:28:02,331 --> 00:28:04,212
But this kind of aggressiveness

477
00:28:04,382 --> 00:28:05,516
is what I mean

478
00:28:05,803 --> 00:28:08,645
by interrupting the enemy's
own decision-making cycle.

479
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,981
It's against all doctrine,

480
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:14,193
but as the General often reminds me,
doctrine

481
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:16,404
is the last refuge of the unimaginative.

482
00:28:17,541 --> 00:28:19,899
The fact is I just got off
the nets with chaos,

483
00:28:20,019 --> 00:28:22,410
and the General is impressed
with our initiative.

484
00:28:23,084 --> 00:28:24,988
We are on his radar screen.

485
00:28:25,722 --> 00:28:26,580
Gentlemen,

486
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:28,916
we're coming out
from beneath all this ass

487
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:31,138
and getting back into the game.

488
00:28:31,343 --> 00:28:33,003
And he's given us a tasker.

489
00:28:36,083 --> 00:28:38,931
This is the Qal'at Sukkar airfield.

490
00:28:39,291 --> 00:28:42,867
A British paratroop regiment
is staging to hit the field at dawn.

491
00:28:43,131 --> 00:28:44,757
The General has advised me

492
00:28:44,877 --> 00:28:46,571
that they are running late.

493
00:28:47,344 --> 00:28:48,645
And he suggested...

494
00:28:48,887 --> 00:28:49,979
If we're up for it.

495
00:28:50,442 --> 00:28:52,492
That we can get to the field first.

496
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,590
To do this, we have to cross 40 kliks.

497
00:28:58,283 --> 00:28:59,822
Godfather needs an airfield.

498
00:29:00,773 --> 00:29:01,573
Sir?

499
00:29:02,111 --> 00:29:03,943
We've good intelligence from the locals

500
00:29:04,063 --> 00:29:06,100
on the Ba'athist and
Republican guard units in this town.

501
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:07,277
We can exploit...

502
00:29:07,397 --> 00:29:10,665
No time. We're pulling out in 	he next hour.
See to it, gentlemen.

503
00:29:14,057 --> 00:29:15,833
All you find, we find.

504
00:29:21,128 --> 00:29:22,223
...together.

505
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:27,057
Meesh, seriously, what's this guy
trying to tell me?

506
00:29:27,217 --> 00:29:28,726
Eeee, They are glad to be liberated.

507
00:29:29,738 --> 00:29:30,999
Okay, I got that.

508
00:29:31,198 --> 00:29:33,006
But What's he trying to tell me right now?

509
00:29:33,126 --> 00:29:35,953
They want to show us
the locations of the Republican guard,

510
00:29:36,073 --> 00:29:38,152
Ba'ath party and fedayeen forces.

511
00:29:39,522 --> 00:29:40,988
Maybe some weapon caches,

512
00:29:41,296 --> 00:29:43,741
- maybe even some chemical weapons.
- Okay then,

513
00:29:44,198 --> 00:29:45,709
it looks like we got our work cut out for us.

514
00:29:45,829 --> 00:29:47,235
Tell him	his man he's going to come with us.

515
00:29:47,355 --> 00:29:50,237
- Tell him I'm going to take him back...
- No, d-do... no.

516
00:29:50,836 --> 00:29:52,712
That's not how we're rolling, eh?

517
00:29:52,832 --> 00:29:54,734
We are pulling out of here soon.

518
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:56,066
But rest assured,

519
00:29:56,186 --> 00:29:59,343
Godfather has a legit plan
to exploit the situation.

520
00:30:00,938 --> 00:30:01,739
We

521
00:30:02,153 --> 00:30:04,587
are going to give
these righteous people...

522
00:30:06,254 --> 00:30:07,500
I.R. chem-lights.

523
00:30:08,122 --> 00:30:10,726
They are going to set them up
where the bad guys are,

524
00:30:10,886 --> 00:30:12,853
nd mark them for the bombers who re going to bomb the shit

525
00:30:13,013 --> 00:30:14,623
out of whatever's marked.

526
00:30:15,177 --> 00:30:16,664
American Air Force.

527
00:30:18,871 --> 00:30:20,424
The best in the world.

528
00:30:21,874 --> 00:30:24,281
How do we know this guy isn't just going
to put it	hese chem-lights on the homes

529
00:30:24,441 --> 00:30:26,075
of people he owes money to?

530
00:30:26,235 --> 00:30:28,276
How do we know for sure
that he's even on our side, Meesh?

531
00:30:28,396 --> 00:30:31,830
How do we know nything unless we properlydebrief
these people and check their intel?

532
00:30:32,122 --> 00:30:32,990
Here.

533
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:35,533
No thanks, Meesh.

534
00:30:38,147 --> 00:30:41,102
Okay, it's not the good shit,
but it's local brewed.

535
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:03,142
You should write this down, reporter.
See, The war's actually not about pussy.

536
00:31:03,262 --> 00:31:07,232
It's about N.A.M.B.L.A. You know:
North American Man-Boy Love Association.

537
00:31:07,451 --> 00:31:10,503
See, Places like Thailand where they used
to fuck little boys and shit,

538
00:31:10,623 --> 00:31:11,996
they're drying up.

539
00:31:12,156 --> 00:31:15,040
We're opening up Iraq
for a whole new supply of kids, man.

540
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,275
Ray, please!

541
00:31:16,953 --> 00:31:19,402
I'm trying to gauge the approach
to our target.

542
00:31:19,522 --> 00:31:20,406
Right!

543
00:31:20,526 --> 00:31:23,383
'cause we're gonna drive
40 kliks off-road

544
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,571
in the dark

545
00:31:24,691 --> 00:31:28,393
to an airfield with Republican guard
on it by ourselves.

546
00:31:28,972 --> 00:31:31,223
And they say that I did
too much acid in high school.

547
00:31:32,006 --> 00:31:34,599
Christ, the business end
of Mattis's crack pipe

548
00:31:34,719 --> 00:31:36,270
must be hot to the fucking touch.

549
00:31:37,621 --> 00:31:40,232
- Brad, listen, there's no way...
- Get down!

550
00:31:40,392 --> 00:31:41,437
- Why?
- Get down!

551
00:31:41,557 --> 00:31:42,358
What?

552
00:31:46,611 --> 00:31:48,718
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

553
00:31:50,847 --> 00:31:52,186
Holy fuck!

554
00:31:52,423 --> 00:31:55,194
- Give me your headset.
- Why are we Iways hating on the mexicans?

555
00:31:55,314 --> 00:31:56,206
Who's up?

556
00:31:56,326 --> 00:31:57,666
Hitman Two, this is Two One.

557
00:31:58,067 --> 00:32:00,595
That is a friendly unit
northbound on the M.S.R.

558
00:32:00,715 --> 00:32:02,004
Firing on our position.

559
00:32:02,643 --> 00:32:04,932
I say again, that is blue-on-blue fire.

560
00:32:06,018 --> 00:32:08,430
They're northbound
toward Assassin's position.

561
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:10,476
- How copy?
- Those are fucking reservists!

562
00:32:10,596 --> 00:32:13,020
<i>- I saw the markings.
- Hitman Two One, this is Hitman Two. Copy.</i>

563
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,262
You all right?

564
00:32:14,382 --> 00:32:16,603
- Yeah, I think so.
- I'm fucking wet!

565
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,279
Did you piss on me?

566
00:32:19,399 --> 00:32:21,904
Don't fucking tell me
I have reporter piss on me.

567
00:32:22,024 --> 00:32:24,902
Brad, they shot our fucking water cans.

568
00:32:25,062 --> 00:32:26,362
We're Oscar Mike.

569
00:32:27,659 --> 00:32:28,666
Damn it.

570
00:32:32,333 --> 00:32:34,731
40 kliks, no fucking water.

571
00:32:34,851 --> 00:32:36,703
Fuck it, at least you're dry.

572
00:32:39,565 --> 00:32:41,441
<i>All Victors, this is Godfather.</i>

573
00:32:41,632 --> 00:32:43,921
<i>Stand by, H&S has a truck down.</i>

574
00:32:44,255 --> 00:32:45,074
Stop.

575
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:48,102
Start, stop, start, stop!

576
00:32:48,862 --> 00:32:49,713
Jesus!

577
00:32:50,248 --> 00:32:52,930
I'm beginning to think
Godfather's just a big cocktease.

578
00:33:03,249 --> 00:33:05,450
They shot a hole in our fucking tire.

579
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:08,100
- You guys all right?
- That was some bullshit.

580
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:10,121
- Trigger-happy reservists.
- Hey, Iceman.

581
00:33:10,241 --> 00:33:13,199
Can you believe those fucking reservists?
They just shot us up.

582
00:33:13,372 --> 00:33:14,803
It was shock trauma.

583
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:16,954
Bunch of fucking doctors.

584
00:33:17,635 --> 00:33:21,375
Didn't they have to take an oath
or some shit against fucking people up?

585
00:33:21,595 --> 00:33:23,929
You need some security
while you do this.

586
00:33:24,417 --> 00:33:26,463
- I'll get with the Lt...
- Belay that, devil dog!

587
00:33:26,623 --> 00:33:28,327
Godfather's gots a mission,

588
00:33:28,684 --> 00:33:30,050
and that mission is now.

589
00:33:30,446 --> 00:33:33,147
Abandon this vehicle,
put your asses on another vehicle.

590
00:33:33,267 --> 00:33:34,638
- Let's get moving.
- But,

591
00:33:34,798 --> 00:33:36,384
- Sergeant...
- No buts!

592
00:33:36,557 --> 00:33:38,470
These asses ain't in gear
10 minutes ago,

593
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:40,126
you's in direct disobedience

594
00:33:40,246 --> 00:33:43,215
of a direct order
from godfather hisself!

595
00:33:49,642 --> 00:33:51,613
- What are you carrying?
- Battalion's chow,

596
00:33:52,050 --> 00:33:53,165
M-16s,

597
00:33:53,594 --> 00:33:54,597
ammo,

598
00:33:55,579 --> 00:33:57,251
400 pounds of C-4,

599
00:33:57,371 --> 00:34:00,632
couple of cases of Claymore mines,
all kind of shit like that.

600
00:34:01,336 --> 00:34:02,342
Torklesen,

601
00:34:02,616 --> 00:34:05,704
get your bubbies in a running truck
and load up right now.

602
00:34:06,006 --> 00:34:06,864
You hear me?

603
00:34:08,896 --> 00:34:11,005
<i>Two One, this is Hitman Two.
Interrogative:</i>

604
00:34:11,125 --> 00:34:12,715
<i>where is the turn? Over.</i>

605
00:34:13,368 --> 00:34:15,028
<i>Hitman Two, this is Two One.</i>

606
00:34:15,148 --> 00:34:17,981
<i>It's coming right up. 100 meters. Over.</i>

607
00:34:18,435 --> 00:34:21,876
<i>Two One, it better be. I can assure you
that Godfather's watching.</i>

608
00:34:25,542 --> 00:34:27,758
Dude, I am so lost right now.

609
00:34:28,606 --> 00:34:31,542
Don't worry about it, buddy.
I know where we're going.

610
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:34,521
We passed seven villages.
There's one more.

611
00:34:35,687 --> 00:34:36,487
Hey...

612
00:34:37,312 --> 00:34:40,189
Do you remember
the gay dog episode of "South park"?

613
00:34:40,356 --> 00:34:42,273
The one where Sparky runs away

614
00:34:42,393 --> 00:34:44,624
'cause he's humping
all those other dogs and shit?

615
00:34:46,258 --> 00:34:47,696
Yes, Ray, I...

616
00:34:48,846 --> 00:34:50,578
I do remember it very well.

617
00:34:52,633 --> 00:34:56,032
But I don't see what relevance
this has on our present status.

618
00:34:56,311 --> 00:34:58,055
There's the hamlet, our turn.

619
00:35:04,468 --> 00:35:06,215
Hitman Two, this is Two One.

620
00:35:06,626 --> 00:35:08,607
We're making that turn now. Over.

621
00:35:09,222 --> 00:35:10,229
<i>Roger that.</i>

622
00:35:10,374 --> 00:35:11,587
<i>Nice job. Over.</i>

623
00:35:13,102 --> 00:35:14,115
Hey, Brad?

624
00:35:15,627 --> 00:35:17,318
Do your big gay Al for me.

625
00:35:21,238 --> 00:35:22,513
Come on, buddy!

626
00:35:22,791 --> 00:35:25,998
Do it for your old pal Ray,
the one who made the right turn.

627
00:35:27,961 --> 00:35:31,324
"Well, hello there, little pup.

628
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,949
"I'm big gay Al.

629
00:35:34,831 --> 00:35:36,367
"Have you been outcast?"

630
00:35:37,382 --> 00:35:38,512
Fuck yeah.

631
00:35:38,673 --> 00:35:42,057
They had this gay bar open up
in the town where I'm from in Michigan,

632
00:35:42,177 --> 00:35:44,293
and people trashed it every night.

633
00:35:44,413 --> 00:35:46,373
They had to close it after a month.

634
00:35:46,493 --> 00:35:48,789
See, but there's money in that,
Trombley.

635
00:35:48,909 --> 00:35:51,848
Did I tell you I'm gonna open
my own gay bar when I get back home?

636
00:35:51,968 --> 00:35:54,951
It's gonna be called the golden stream.
And it's gonna be like this

637
00:35:55,071 --> 00:35:56,349
big urinal, right?

638
00:35:56,469 --> 00:36:00,266
And there's gonna be this two-way mirror
that everybody pisses against.

639
00:36:00,386 --> 00:36:02,571
That way when you're sitting
at the bar having drinks,

640
00:36:02,691 --> 00:36:05,956
there's like all these big fucking
giant cocks just pissing right at you.

641
00:36:06,076 --> 00:36:07,664
Corporal, are you a faggot?

642
00:36:07,909 --> 00:36:10,502
You know what?
I'm gonna franchise that shit.

643
00:36:11,427 --> 00:36:13,006
You can have Michigan, Trombley.

644
00:36:13,126 --> 00:36:15,568
Very lucrative territory,
homosexually speaking.

645
00:36:15,688 --> 00:36:17,301
That's not funny, Corporal Person.

646
00:36:17,461 --> 00:36:18,990
Ray, give it a rest.

647
00:36:19,641 --> 00:36:20,721
<i>Echo Five Charlie,</i>

648
00:36:20,881 --> 00:36:23,872
Echo Five Charlie,
this is Echo Five Echo.

649
00:36:23,992 --> 00:36:26,533
Interrogative:
how much further to the airfield?

650
00:36:26,653 --> 00:36:28,667
<i>Echo Five Echo, I don't copy.</i>

651
00:36:31,141 --> 00:36:32,024
Sergeant?

652
00:36:32,536 --> 00:36:35,024
- What?
- I just lost my helmet.

653
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,050
What do you want to do, hold a funeral?

654
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:40,020
- Sergeant?
- We ain't going back for it, Gabe.

655
00:37:29,725 --> 00:37:31,287
Get me General Mattis.

656
00:37:34,698 --> 00:37:36,420
Chaos actual, this is Godfather.

657
00:37:36,581 --> 00:37:38,423
Stand by for traffic. Over.

658
00:37:38,583 --> 00:37:40,364
Roger. Send traffic. Over.

659
00:37:40,484 --> 00:37:41,927
Sir, we got Chaos on the net.

660
00:37:44,738 --> 00:37:46,542
Chaos, this is Godfather.

661
00:37:46,662 --> 00:37:49,072
Teams are out now
getting eyes on the field. Break.

662
00:37:49,192 --> 00:37:52,187
We'll have complete sit-rep for you
within five mikes. How copy? Over.

663
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:55,376
- Solid copy.
- Roger that. Out.

664
00:37:56,662 --> 00:37:58,065
Chaos is waiting.

665
00:37:58,185 --> 00:37:59,319
Brits are in the air.

666
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:02,155
But our u-2 surveillance
picked up four possible

667
00:38:02,315 --> 00:38:04,512
t-72 tanks on the iraqi field.

668
00:38:05,193 --> 00:38:08,829
If our eyes affirm this intel, Chaos
needs to abort the british assault.

669
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:12,247
They hit the point of no return
in under 30 mikes.

670
00:38:12,367 --> 00:38:15,044
So where the fuck are my eyes
on that field?

671
00:38:16,454 --> 00:38:19,502
Assassin actual,
Godfather needs your sit-rep asap. Over.

672
00:38:19,622 --> 00:38:21,133
Roger that. Stand by.

673
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:24,912
Assassin Two Three,
this is Assassin actual. How copy?

674
00:38:27,965 --> 00:38:30,274
Assassin, this is Assassin Two Three.

675
00:38:30,509 --> 00:38:33,045
We are one klik out.
40 mikes from objective.

676
00:38:33,294 --> 00:38:35,907
I say again, 4-0 mikes. Over.

677
00:38:36,515 --> 00:38:37,427
Roger.

678
00:38:39,542 --> 00:38:42,154
Alpha is 40 mikes away
from getting eyes on the field.

679
00:38:43,862 --> 00:38:45,742
These guys have bitched and moaned,

680
00:38:45,862 --> 00:38:49,845
moaned and bitched that I haven't
given them a legitimate recon mission.

681
00:38:49,965 --> 00:38:53,040
I finally give them one,
and they fucking fail me.

682
00:38:57,251 --> 00:38:59,131
We don't have that option.

683
00:38:59,251 --> 00:39:00,505
We will recon that field.

684
00:39:01,025 --> 00:39:02,799
We will recon it in force.

685
00:39:02,999 --> 00:39:06,549
I want the entire battalion Oscar Mike
inside of 10 minutes.

686
00:39:11,624 --> 00:39:12,429
Sir,

687
00:39:13,251 --> 00:39:15,252
that's not a reconnaissance mission.

688
00:39:15,372 --> 00:39:17,522
- That's an assault.
- Semantics.

689
00:39:19,043 --> 00:39:20,675
What about the T-72s?

690
00:39:21,004 --> 00:39:23,704
The violence of action
is to our advantage.

691
00:39:23,902 --> 00:39:27,283
I'll request that division
adjust the R.O.E. accordingly.

692
00:39:30,005 --> 00:39:30,993
Roger that, sir.

693
00:39:34,244 --> 00:39:35,941
Assassin Actual, this is Godfather.

694
00:39:36,061 --> 00:39:37,872
Abort that mission. R.T.B.

695
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:40,816
<i>Interrogative:
you want me to return to base?</i>

696
00:39:40,936 --> 00:39:41,986
Affirmative.

697
00:39:47,849 --> 00:39:50,085
<i>All Hitman Two Gunners be advised.</i>

698

<i>Alpha has a team

699
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:55,870
<i>How copy?</i>

700
00:39:58,028 --> 00:39:58,803
Brad?

701
00:40:01,498 --> 00:40:02,948
Get your team ready.

702
00:40:03,134 --> 00:40:04,740
We're assaulting the airfield.

703
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:06,395
Less than 10 mikes.

704
00:40:09,025 --> 00:40:09,952
Wake up.

705
00:40:10,072 --> 00:40:12,451
Walt, range the Mark-19 as far out

706
00:40:12,612 --> 00:40:15,204
as you feel comfortable
engaging targets with good effect.

707
00:40:16,059 --> 00:40:17,630
What about Alpha's recon?

708
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:19,189
They're out of time.

709
00:40:19,309 --> 00:40:20,668
- I'm up.
- They fucked it.

710
00:40:20,993 --> 00:40:22,711
We're going up against tanks.

711
00:40:24,168 --> 00:40:26,220
Grab a diesel. Let's mount up.

712
00:40:26,642 --> 00:40:28,336
It's on race. Two Two's up.

713
00:40:28,456 --> 00:40:30,631
Yo, man,
if you have to do number one, go now,

714
00:40:30,751 --> 00:40:32,834
because once I start the car,
I am not stopping.

715
00:40:32,954 --> 00:40:34,129
Naked Marine,

716
00:40:34,249 --> 00:40:36,392
- the Internet loves you!
- Fuck you, Person.

717
00:40:36,553 --> 00:40:39,750
- Get your ass back in the vehicle.
- Where's Lilley?

718
00:40:40,998 --> 00:40:42,548
We're Oscar Mike, man.

719
00:40:42,732 --> 00:40:43,670
Move it.

720
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:46,862
- You really are gay, aren't you?
- Brah I'm not cool.

721
00:41:05,025 --> 00:41:06,141
<i>This is Godfather.</i>

722
00:41:06,261 --> 00:41:08,709
<i>Godfather Actual

<i>in proximity to the objective.

724
00:41:11,869 --> 00:41:13,565
Affirmative. Copy that.

725
00:41:14,483 --> 00:41:16,498
Godfather just changed
the rules of engagement.

726
00:41:16,618 --> 00:41:18,168
He's lowered the bar.

727
00:41:19,554 --> 00:41:21,404
Shit, he's removed the bar.

728
00:41:22,193 --> 00:41:26,143
New R.O.E. has all Iraqis on or near
that airfield declared hostile.

729
00:41:26,823 --> 00:41:27,819
A free-fire zone?

730
00:41:29,621 --> 00:41:31,155
I'm not passing that word.

731
00:41:31,557 --> 00:41:33,866
Keep this change in the R.O.E.
off our net.

732
00:41:40,795 --> 00:41:42,628
Got any comms with those A-10s?

733
00:41:42,748 --> 00:41:43,698
Negative.

734
00:41:44,162 --> 00:41:46,312
Those jets are goddamn Air Force.

735
00:41:46,524 --> 00:41:47,838
They shoot marines.

736
00:41:48,451 --> 00:41:49,857
You know, That map showed fences.

737
00:41:49,977 --> 00:41:51,942
If there's fences,
we'e gonnall need the bolt cutters.

738
00:41:52,062 --> 00:41:53,543
They're under the reporter's seat.

739
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:56,829
Hey,Can you lift your ass in a hurry
if we need to get to those bolt cutters?

740
00:41:56,949 --> 00:41:57,968
I think so.

741
00:42:04,099 --> 00:42:06,732
You have to get out of the Humvee
to open it.

742
00:42:06,893 --> 00:42:09,153
- I don't see a fence anyway.
- Do you need them now?

743
00:42:09,273 --> 00:42:10,946
Charlie just cleared a guard tower.

744
00:42:13,068 --> 00:42:15,167
- What is it, walt?
- Fucking shit!

745
00:42:15,287 --> 00:42:16,637
Mark-19's jammed.

746
00:42:17,834 --> 00:42:19,585
Hitman Two, this is Two One.

747
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:21,475
Our mark-19 is down.

748
00:42:21,758 --> 00:42:23,458
I say again, our main gun is down.

749
00:42:23,618 --> 00:42:24,368
Shit!

750
00:42:24,744 --> 00:42:26,961
Either unfuck it now
or get on your fucking saw.

751
00:42:27,122 --> 00:42:28,045
I'm trying.

752
00:42:28,206 --> 00:42:30,298
I see men running,
200 meters, 10 o'clock.

753
00:42:30,458 --> 00:42:31,925
- Are they Armed?
- They're something.

754
00:42:32,085 --> 00:42:34,947
Well, the order is
everyone is declared hostile.

755
00:42:35,067 --> 00:42:36,221
Light 'em the fuck up.

756
00:42:40,752 --> 00:42:42,769
Oh, Shooting motherfuckers like it's cool.

757
00:42:45,831 --> 00:42:46,564
Fuck!

758
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:52,631
<i>All right, gents,

<i>Maintain your dispersion.</i>

<i>Target building 500 meters ahead. Break.</i>

763

<i>Hitman Three is holding our flank. Over.</i>

764
00:43:30,746 --> 00:43:32,444
<i>Hitman Two, this is Two One.</i>

765
00:43:32,604 --> 00:43:35,258
<i>Have two tanks, northwest side
of the warehouse. Over.</i>

766
00:43:35,378 --> 00:43:37,324
<i>This is Hitman Two. Affirmative.</i>

767
00:43:37,484 --> 00:43:39,993
<i>They appear to be stationary.
No personnel.</i>

768
00:43:40,349 --> 00:43:42,318
<i>Hitman Two, this is Hitman Two Three.</i>

769
00:43:42,438 --> 00:43:45,438
<i>I have an unmanned Z.P.U.-57 Tac-2.</i>

770
00:43:45,558 --> 00:43:47,250
<i>Appears to be abandoned. Over.</i>

771
00:43:47,410 --> 00:43:49,199
<i>Two Three, this is Two. Copy that.</i>

772
00:43:49,319 --> 00:43:50,920
He's got his fucking bayonet out.

773
00:43:52,587 --> 00:43:55,191
- Doing his Rambo.
- Follow my tracers!

774
00:43:55,376 --> 00:43:56,926
He's shooting at scraps of metal.

775
00:44:00,131 --> 00:44:03,395
Can you believe that fucking retard
is in charge of people?

776
00:44:03,515 --> 00:44:04,624
Jesus Christ.

777
00:44:08,865 --> 00:44:10,190
Engage those buildings!

778
00:44:10,874 --> 00:44:12,859
Sir, that's more than 3,000 meters away.

779
00:44:13,153 --> 00:44:14,527
Range of my fifty is 1830.

780
00:44:15,681 --> 00:44:17,067
Move into position.

781
00:44:17,187 --> 00:44:18,323
Engage! Engage!

782
00:44:24,614 --> 00:44:26,043
Should I light them up?

783
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:26,863
No.

784
00:44:27,357 --> 00:44:28,807
We're not engaging.

785
00:44:29,144 --> 00:44:31,138
Those aren't military buildings.

786
00:44:31,258 --> 00:44:32,808
They're civilian huts.

787
00:44:40,617 --> 00:44:41,367
Yeah,

788
00:44:42,283 --> 00:44:45,554
looks like Saddam's big bad
republican guard hajis

789
00:44:45,674 --> 00:44:46,976
got wind I was coming.

790
00:44:47,602 --> 00:44:50,585
As the great warrior-poet
Ice Cube once said,

791
00:44:50,901 --> 00:44:53,189
"If the day does not require an A.K.,

792
00:44:53,309 --> 00:44:54,459
"it is good. "

793
00:44:55,236 --> 00:44:57,292
They stick around and man those,
we'd have been dead

794
00:44:57,412 --> 00:44:58,832
before we even saw them.

795
00:44:58,952 --> 00:45:01,323
- Take a picture of me...
- Dude, lighten up.

796
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:07,504
Then again the world wouldn't have
to deal with the prospect of you

797
00:45:07,624 --> 00:45:10,319
returning to your cretinous
daughter-fucking trailer-park

798
00:45:10,439 --> 00:45:12,662
red-state shithole,
and producing mutant,

799
00:45:12,782 --> 00:45:16,297
whiskey tango, scrotum-faced,
bucktoothed, zit-exploding progeny.

800
00:45:16,417 --> 00:45:17,194
Heads up.

801
00:45:19,093 --> 00:45:20,635
I need a channel to division main.

802
00:45:24,228 --> 00:45:26,578
Lance Corporal Trombley, channel five.

803
00:45:28,295 --> 00:45:28,995
Sir.

804
00:45:31,124 --> 00:45:32,819
Chaos, this is godfather.

805
00:45:32,939 --> 00:45:33,694
<i>Send it.</i>

806
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:36,664
Be advised.
We have seized the enemy airfield.

807
00:45:37,245 --> 00:45:38,668
Early reports are

808
00:45:38,788 --> 00:45:40,905
we've captured several enemy tanks

809
00:45:41,065 --> 00:45:42,696
and self-propelled triple-a batteries.

810
00:45:42,816 --> 00:45:43,616
It appears

811
00:45:44,005 --> 00:45:47,988
that we've overrun the entire
255th mechanized regiment who have fled.

812
00:45:48,565 --> 00:45:49,515
And sir,

813
00:45:49,706 --> 00:45:51,756
we've sustained zero casualties.

814
00:45:52,084 --> 00:45:53,134
<i>Outstanding.</i>

815
00:45:53,377 --> 00:45:54,327
Thank you.

816
00:45:54,491 --> 00:45:55,741
Roger that. Out.

817
00:46:01,285 --> 00:46:03,444
- Is that the british paratroopers?
- No.

818
00:46:03,564 --> 00:46:06,442
We scrubbed their mission.
We got here first.

819
00:46:09,139 --> 00:46:10,089
Gentlemen.

820
00:46:12,008 --> 00:46:13,438
We just seized an airfield.

821
00:46:16,625 --> 00:46:18,575
That was pretty fucking ninja.

822
00:46:24,838 --> 00:46:26,340
Just keep it dry, eh?

823
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:29,230
I know they're heinous, bro.
I'm living in it.

824
00:46:29,350 --> 00:46:31,014
- Holy fuck.
- Jesus!

825
00:46:31,134 --> 00:46:32,985
- That feels good.
- Smells like dick juice.

826
00:46:33,105 --> 00:46:35,543
When's the last time
you took your boot off and gave your paw some air?

827
00:46:35,703 --> 00:46:38,565
- Come on, doc,give it a rest.
- You know we can't.

828
00:46:38,685 --> 00:46:40,708
They ordered us to sleep
in the damn things.

829
00:46:40,828 --> 00:46:42,252
Got some good news...

830
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:44,464
We're so far ahead of R.C.T. 1,

831
00:46:44,584 --> 00:46:46,845
we'll be here a good 24 hours
before they show up.

832
00:46:47,007 --> 00:46:49,800
However, there is a bit of concern
in some quarters about being overrun,

833
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,969
since we don't eally know
what's around us out here,

834
00:46:52,089 --> 00:46:55,104
so make sure you maintain 50% watch
and the comms are good.

835
00:46:55,264 --> 00:46:57,829
We got pre-register on-call
artillery if we want it.

836
00:46:57,949 --> 00:47:00,810
Sir, has any thought been given
to destroying the weapons

837
00:47:00,930 --> 00:47:03,580
and ordinance
that are sitting over there?

838
00:47:05,089 --> 00:47:06,907
Actually that did come up.

839
00:47:07,777 --> 00:47:10,620
But it seems the battalion's supply
of C-4 is now unaccounted for.

840
00:47:11,234 --> 00:47:13,164
The battalion supply truck
we left last night,

841
00:47:13,719 --> 00:47:16,814
it is a smoldering heap
of twisted metal and failed hopes

842
00:47:16,934 --> 00:47:20,212
in the trustworthiness of the iraqis
we are striving so hard to liberate.

843
00:47:21,484 --> 00:47:22,965
What does that mean, sir?

844
00:47:24,775 --> 00:47:26,956
It means we're on one meal a day.

845
00:47:33,122 --> 00:47:35,857
I'm just saying
I'm surprised is all, Brad.

846
00:47:35,977 --> 00:47:38,553
- I mean, aren't you surprised?
- Shut the fuck up.

847
00:47:38,673 --> 00:47:40,919
I mean, I'm betting

848
00:47:41,039 --> 00:47:44,207
that they were thinking...
That they could just, you know,

849
00:47:44,575 --> 00:47:47,790
leave a fully-loaded
supply truck laying around.

850
00:47:48,276 --> 00:47:50,391
Just like you could anywhere
in american, you know.

851
00:47:50,511 --> 00:47:53,121
I mean, you park your unlocked car

852
00:47:53,810 --> 00:47:55,540
in Detroit or Baltimore, I mean,

853
00:47:56,010 --> 00:47:58,501
your shit's gonna be there
guaranteed when you get back

854
00:47:58,661 --> 00:48:01,212
from the day spa with your skin
all exfoliated and shit, right?

855
00:48:02,623 --> 00:48:04,591
I meanseriously, homes,

856
00:48:05,006 --> 00:48:07,706
why would our Iraqi brethren

857
00:48:07,826 --> 00:48:09,637
want 400 Ibs

858
00:48:10,263 --> 00:48:14,262
of C-4, claymores and crates of M-16s?
I mean, it just doesn't make any sense.

859
00:48:15,355 --> 00:48:16,242
Wait!

860
00:48:16,362 --> 00:48:18,938
/You knowThey could be using
all that C-4 for, like,

861
00:48:19,618 --> 00:48:22,185
a giant 4th of july celebration.

862
00:48:22,512 --> 00:48:23,567
What do you think,Brad?

863
00:48:23,775 --> 00:48:26,445
I think it's time for
you to shut the fuck up.

864
00:48:26,606 --> 00:48:29,255
Nice job shooting those camels,
Trombley.

865
00:48:29,925 --> 00:48:32,200
I think I shot one of those Iraqis too.

866
00:48:32,431 --> 00:48:33,741
I saw him fall.

867
00:48:33,861 --> 00:48:36,122
- All we saw was camels going down.
- Camel killer.

868
00:48:38,855 --> 00:48:41,931
Look, I didn't mean
to shoot innocent camels, all right?

869
00:48:42,051 --> 00:48:43,701
I'm sure I shot people.

870
00:48:45,045 --> 00:48:47,634
Shouldn't you two be doing
the after-action report on Alpha's

871
00:48:47,954 --> 00:48:49,552
failedrecon mission?

872
00:49:07,221 --> 00:49:09,852
What's this about
you losing your kevlar?

873
00:49:10,516 --> 00:49:13,500
It bounced off my head,
Sergeant Major, last night.

874
00:49:13,863 --> 00:49:14,997
Bounced off your head?

875
00:49:15,117 --> 00:49:17,913
I was up on the fifty cal and the Humvee
went over a berm, Sergeant Major.

876
00:49:18,074 --> 00:49:19,791
That kevlar wasn't yours to lose!

877
00:49:21,221 --> 00:49:24,504
That was the property of
this united states Marine corps!

878
00:49:25,539 --> 00:49:26,922
It belonged to every Marine!

879
00:49:28,026 --> 00:49:30,468
'cause of your failure
to secure that helmet

880
00:49:30,949 --> 00:49:33,840
you've jeopardized
every Marine serving today.

881
00:49:36,426 --> 00:49:38,776
I was considering N.J.P.Ing your ass.

882
00:49:39,470 --> 00:49:40,769
Sergeant Colbert!

883
00:49:41,298 --> 00:49:43,855
This is what happens when you
don't enforce the grooming standards.

884
00:49:44,492 --> 00:49:46,526
The mens gets all lax

885
00:49:46,686 --> 00:49:48,745
and then other standards fall.

886
00:49:49,685 --> 00:49:52,823
Devil dog here stops using
his chinstrap, goes over a bump,

887
00:49:52,943 --> 00:49:54,908
kevlar goes flying off his head,

888
00:49:55,587 --> 00:49:57,369
and our protective posture...

889
00:49:57,990 --> 00:49:59,102
is weakened.

890
00:50:00,249 --> 00:50:01,832
Roger that, Sergeant Major.

891
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:10,424
I'm not the fucking retard
who lost a whole supply truck.

892
00:50:14,755 --> 00:50:17,390
Gimme any target,
I'll hit anything out to 700 yards.

893
00:50:18,932 --> 00:50:20,616
What are they dragging?

894
00:50:20,934 --> 00:50:22,588
Think they want something?

895
00:50:22,708 --> 00:50:25,377
One humanitarian ration
for two blowjobs.

896
00:50:25,497 --> 00:50:28,447
That's the going rate
in this part of the world.

897
00:50:31,110 --> 00:50:32,832
Stiney, give me a hand.

898
00:50:44,862 --> 00:50:45,707
Stop.

899
00:50:53,739 --> 00:50:54,934
Hey, buddy,

900
00:50:55,315 --> 00:50:56,565
can you hear me?

901
00:50:57,394 --> 00:50:58,188
Good.

902
00:51:12,045 --> 00:51:13,820
The kid's been zipped with 556.

903
00:51:15,763 --> 00:51:16,948
Marines shot this kid.

904
00:51:18,937 --> 00:51:20,546
Fucking jackasses.

905
00:51:21,748 --> 00:51:23,330
Trigger-happy motherfucker.

906
00:51:23,492 --> 00:51:25,708
- Doc, is there anything I can do?
- Yeah,

907
00:51:26,054 --> 00:51:28,081
Stiney, get me the battalion surgeon.

908
00:51:28,201 --> 00:51:30,774
We need to cas-evac
this kid or he's dead.

909
00:51:30,894 --> 00:51:31,974
Done.

910
00:51:34,769 --> 00:51:37,803
Christeson, Stafford,
two stretchers to doc, 12 o'clock.

911
00:51:41,147 --> 00:51:42,837
You're a very brave kid.

912
00:51:45,305 --> 00:51:47,155
He's very strong, all right?

913
00:51:49,238 --> 00:51:50,692
- Doc?
- Yeah?

914
00:51:51,317 --> 00:51:53,083
He's been hit by 556.

915
00:51:53,852 --> 00:51:57,195
Blew out his calf muscle
but there's no arterial bleeding.

916
00:51:57,315 --> 00:51:58,949
- He'll make it.
- Roger that.

917
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:02,470
Why aren't they angry?

918
00:52:03,607 --> 00:52:06,706
They are grateful to be liberated
and welcome the Americans as friends.

919
00:52:09,716 --> 00:52:11,838
- These mistakes are unavoidable in war.
- Bullshit!

920
00:52:13,125 --> 00:52:14,975
We're fucking recon Marines!

921
00:52:16,610 --> 00:52:18,519
Our whole fucking job is to observe

922
00:52:18,639 --> 00:52:20,428
and not make these kinds of mistakes.

923
00:52:21,036 --> 00:52:23,014
And we don't fucking shoot unarmed kids.

924
00:52:23,435 --> 00:52:25,018
Where did this happen?

925
00:52:31,945 --> 00:52:34,192
Dude, they were tending
their camels and shit,

926
00:52:34,685 --> 00:52:36,320
so who knows where it was.

927
00:52:41,679 --> 00:52:42,778
Fuck, man.

928
00:52:44,086 --> 00:52:45,120
Trombley did this.

929
00:52:54,791 --> 00:52:55,519
Sir...

930
00:52:55,639 --> 00:52:58,925
Priority one surgical pediatric,
four bullet wounds to the abdomen,

931
00:52:59,369 --> 00:53:01,637
144 tach weak; 30 rest,

932
00:53:02,058 --> 00:53:05,057
90 over palp. He's... stable for now.

933
00:53:05,629 --> 00:53:08,101
Godfather's denied the request
to cas-evac the boy.

934
00:53:10,552 --> 00:53:12,314
We need to cas-evac him or he's dead.

935
00:53:13,147 --> 00:53:14,888
I'll go ask
the battalion commander again.

936
00:53:15,008 --> 00:53:16,291
Thank you, sir.

937
00:53:18,773 --> 00:53:21,023
Shot by that asshole Trombley, Brad.

938
00:53:21,357 --> 00:53:24,076
He's been zipped by 556
from Trombley's saw.

939
00:53:26,073 --> 00:53:27,923
Don't put this on Trombley.

940
00:53:28,694 --> 00:53:30,544
- I'm responsible.
- Yeah?

941
00:53:32,536 --> 00:53:34,753
20 other Marines drove by them
and didn't shoot.

942
00:53:36,726 --> 00:53:39,976
Why don't we bring Trombley here
to see what he's done?

943
00:53:41,297 --> 00:53:43,429
Don't say that. It was my order.

944
00:53:44,073 --> 00:53:45,190
What can I do here?

945
00:53:45,310 --> 00:53:47,641
Not a fucking thing, apparently, Brad.

946
00:53:52,224 --> 00:53:54,496
There's gotta be something we can do.

947
00:53:54,616 --> 00:53:56,984
Under the rules, we have to
provide him with care until he dies.

948
00:53:58,300 --> 00:53:59,124
Yeah.

949
00:53:59,870 --> 00:54:00,821
Well, so...

950
00:54:02,321 --> 00:54:05,200
Put him in my care. I'm billeted
next to the battalion commander.

951
00:54:05,362 --> 00:54:06,576
If he's in my care

952
00:54:06,737 --> 00:54:09,914
and godfather has to watch him die,
he might change his order.

953
00:54:10,276 --> 00:54:12,959
- Right, let's do this.
- It's the only chance we got.

954
00:54:14,385 --> 00:54:16,169
- All right, on three.
- Gentle.

955
00:54:16,330 --> 00:54:18,032
Ready, one, two, three.

956
00:54:19,424 --> 00:54:20,299
Ready?

957
00:54:20,595 --> 00:54:21,711
Let's go.

958
00:54:54,987 --> 00:54:56,377
What the hell is going on here?

959
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:58,128
We brought him here to die.

960
00:55:04,867 --> 00:55:06,637
Get him the fuck out of here.

961
00:55:09,451 --> 00:55:10,451
Stafford.

962
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:15,604
- Set him down over here.
- Sergeant Major.

963
00:55:17,018 --> 00:55:18,856
What the fuck is going on?

964
00:55:20,571 --> 00:55:21,416
Sir.

965
00:55:22,426 --> 00:55:24,196
Bravo Two in rebellion.

966
00:55:24,316 --> 00:55:27,099
Because they thinks
they shot an Iraqi child.

967
00:55:28,194 --> 00:55:29,644
Does he want water?

968
00:55:29,789 --> 00:55:31,087
Keep him still.

969
00:55:31,895 --> 00:55:34,655
You're requesting that I send
this wounded civilian

970
00:55:34,775 --> 00:55:36,000
to the R.C.T. for aid?

971
00:55:38,622 --> 00:55:39,578
Problem.

972
00:55:40,904 --> 00:55:44,571
Our tactical situation
is extremely precarious here.

973
00:55:48,843 --> 00:55:51,708
These are the northern most
Marines' positions.

974
00:55:52,249 --> 00:55:54,480
And we are 30 kliks north of them.

975
00:55:56,203 --> 00:55:58,063
We are far behind enemy lines.

976
00:55:59,518 --> 00:56:01,317
We have incomplete intel

977
00:56:01,478 --> 00:56:04,328
as to the disposition
of the Iraqi units here,

978
00:56:04,470 --> 00:56:06,113
here and here.

979
00:56:07,359 --> 00:56:08,695
We don't even know

980
00:56:08,815 --> 00:56:11,993
what happened to the 4,000 troops
that were at this airfield

981
00:56:12,154 --> 00:56:13,359
six hours ago.

982
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:16,267
And there's only 350 of us.

983
00:56:18,644 --> 00:56:19,793
What can be done?

984
00:56:20,957 --> 00:56:22,049
Option one:

985
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:24,276
cas-evac by helicopter.

986
00:56:24,396 --> 00:56:25,558
Doesn't exist.

987
00:56:26,521 --> 00:56:28,803
Army, Marines are engaged.

988
00:56:29,061 --> 00:56:30,411
Taking casualties.

989
00:56:31,877 --> 00:56:34,809
Last night the Iraqis
stopped the army advance.

990
00:56:35,717 --> 00:56:38,182
They turned back 36 apache helicopters,

991
00:56:39,344 --> 00:56:40,601
shot a few down.

992
00:56:43,087 --> 00:56:44,155
Option two:

993
00:56:45,142 --> 00:56:46,748
I detach a platoon

994
00:56:47,481 --> 00:56:49,824
and have them drive kliks

995
00:56:50,111 --> 00:56:53,035
through enemy lines
to the shock-trauma unit here.

996
00:56:55,812 --> 00:56:58,735
If any of you were a casualty right now.

997
00:57:00,070 --> 00:57:02,043
I don't think I could cas-evac you.

998
00:57:03,773 --> 00:57:05,358
But supposing I could,

999
00:57:06,671 --> 00:57:08,884
I imagine there is some of you think

1000
00:57:09,313 --> 00:57:11,442
we have to give wounded civilians

1001
00:57:11,562 --> 00:57:14,383
every consideration
we would give ourselves.

1002
00:57:16,154 --> 00:57:17,504
That is not true.

1003
00:57:19,615 --> 00:57:21,024
The R.O.E. say...

1004
00:57:21,901 --> 00:57:24,275
we have to give them
the same medical care

1005
00:57:24,395 --> 00:57:26,694
they would get by local standards.

1006
00:57:28,826 --> 00:57:31,104
The standards here are fucking zero.

1007
00:57:31,463 --> 00:57:33,761
It's a shitty situation for us,

1008
00:57:35,063 --> 00:57:37,213
but nobody put a gun to our heads

1009
00:57:37,446 --> 00:57:38,914
and forced us to come here.

1010
00:57:40,333 --> 00:57:41,883
We're all volunteers.

1011
00:57:56,432 --> 00:57:57,970
Get me Captain Patterson.

1012
00:57:58,090 --> 00:57:59,064
Yes, sir.

1013
00:58:00,003 --> 00:58:02,145
Assassin Actual, this is Godfather Five.

1014
00:58:02,457 --> 00:58:05,235
<i>Godfather Five, this is Assassin Actual.
Send traffic.</i>

1015
00:58:05,355 --> 00:58:06,707
D.X. on the net. Over.

1016
00:58:06,827 --> 00:58:09,170
<i>- Standing by.
- I'm dispatching an Alpha platoon</i>

1017
00:58:09,290 --> 00:58:11,905
to take this child
to the shock-trauma unit.

1018
00:58:21,794 --> 00:58:23,744
Huddle up. We're gonna talk.

1019
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:25,636
Ray.

1020
00:58:27,478 --> 00:58:28,986
<i>This is Echo Four Charlie.</i>

1021
00:58:29,106 --> 00:58:31,049
<i>Assault Two One Bravo's gone.</i>

1022
00:58:31,546 --> 00:58:34,065
<i>Echo Three Lima is up on Two One Bravo.</i>

1023
00:58:42,831 --> 00:58:44,581
We made a mistake today...

1024
00:58:45,565 --> 00:58:47,549
collectively and individually.

1025
00:58:48,109 --> 00:58:49,659
We must get past this.

1026
00:58:50,062 --> 00:58:52,988
Can't sit around and call it quits now.
We have fighting ahead.

1027
00:58:53,557 --> 00:58:55,281
Look, guys, we're Americans.

1028
00:58:55,443 --> 00:58:58,035
We must make sure when we take
a shot that we are threatened.

1029
00:58:59,359 --> 00:59:01,830
You gotta see that these
people are just like you.

1030
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:04,522
You gotta see past the huts, the camels,

1031
00:59:04,756 --> 00:59:06,904
the different clothes they wear.

1032
00:59:07,234 --> 00:59:09,380
These are people
in this fucking country.

1033
00:59:09,792 --> 00:59:11,823
This family here might lose a son.

1034
00:59:12,146 --> 00:59:14,551
We shot their camels too. One camel.

1035
00:59:14,671 --> 00:59:16,612
Could be a year's income to them.

1036
00:59:17,692 --> 00:59:20,098
We're not here to destroy
their way of life.

1037
00:59:20,506 --> 00:59:22,562
Trombley, you have to
be prepared for the possibility

1038
00:59:22,682 --> 00:59:25,225
of a formal investigation
in this shooting.

1039
00:59:25,582 --> 00:59:27,259
You need to write it up.

1040
00:59:29,443 --> 00:59:30,793
Keep your head up.

1041
00:59:36,359 --> 00:59:38,303
Is it going to be okay, Sergeant?

1042
00:59:38,423 --> 00:59:39,573
I mean this...

1043
00:59:39,945 --> 00:59:41,379
investigation?

1044
00:59:41,738 --> 00:59:42,955
You'll be fine, Trombley.

1045
00:59:44,572 --> 00:59:46,556
No, I mean for you, Sergeant,

1046
00:59:47,176 --> 00:59:49,126
since you gave the all orders.

1047
00:59:51,414 --> 00:59:53,492
I don't care about any of this,
you know?

1048
00:59:53,612 --> 00:59:55,840
I'll be out in a couple of years.

1049
00:59:56,456 --> 00:59:57,466
But you...

1050
00:59:59,098 --> 01:00:01,070
Sergeant, this is your career.

1051
01:00:04,001 --> 01:00:05,163
I'll be fine.

1052
01:00:10,102 --> 01:00:12,570
<i>Hitman Two Three,
this is Hitman Two Two.</i>

1053
01:00:13,026 --> 01:00:15,279
<i>Watch my six. I'm taking a dump.</i>

1054
01:00:18,294 --> 01:00:19,410
<i>Roger that.</i>

1055
01:00:22,132 --> 01:00:24,955
I don't want to sound like
I'm defending Trombley or anything...

1056
01:00:26,307 --> 01:00:30,002
but how come nobody remembers
that they declared everybody hostile?

1057
01:00:30,535 --> 01:00:32,345
I mean, they told us
to shoot at everybody.

1058
01:00:32,465 --> 01:00:33,274
Yeah.

1059
01:00:34,801 --> 01:00:36,467
But you know what's even more fucked up?

1060
01:00:37,156 --> 01:00:40,373
Trombley only shot two bursts
maybe seven rounds.

1061
01:00:43,850 --> 01:00:46,912
I mean, we're bumping down a dirt road,
his targets are like

1062
01:00:47,032 --> 01:00:49,688
200 meters out and he hits exactly

1063
01:00:49,849 --> 01:00:51,899
what the fuck he's shooting at?

1064
01:00:52,337 --> 01:00:53,650
I mean, fuck, man,

1065
01:00:53,811 --> 01:00:56,488
the boy is a cold-on deadeye killer.

1066
01:00:57,379 --> 01:00:58,576
Yeah, no shit.

1067
01:01:00,116 --> 01:01:01,966
That's 'cause he's a psycho.

1068
01:01:06,367 --> 01:01:08,340
But at least he's our psycho.

1069
01:01:17,251 --> 01:01:18,901
You all right, reporter?

1070
01:01:21,563 --> 01:01:22,928
Yeah, I'm just...

1071
01:01:23,048 --> 01:01:23,971
sucking wind.

1072
01:01:30,909 --> 01:01:32,459
What happened today...

1073
01:01:49,347 --> 01:01:51,298
You need to square those walls.

1074
01:01:51,418 --> 01:01:53,794
You'll never make any
progress digging that way.

1075
