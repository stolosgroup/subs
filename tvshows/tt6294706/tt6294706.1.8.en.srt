Why you hating on Corey all of a sudden?

00:00:08,445 --> 00:00:10,178
They been talkin' shit about Reg.

00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,845
Corey keep looking over

00:00:11,947 --> 00:00:14,114
- Yo!
- Yo, whoa, wait. Hold up.

00:00:14,217 --> 00:00:15,749
<i>It was that old-ass man that broke</i>

7
00:00:15,851 --> 00:00:17,151
<i>into our stash house
and took our guns.</i>

8
00:00:17,253 --> 00:00:19,353
Problem is, I put you in charge of that.

9
00:00:19,455 --> 00:00:21,489
Come on, bro, I gotta look
out for my little brother, bro.

10

<i>I wanna know how

00:00:25,795 --> 00:00:28,222
You fuck up like that again,

00:00:29,304 --> 00:00:30,449
I'ma take your life.

<i>Head nurse been

15
00:00:32,234 --> 00:00:33,493
Medicine come up missing.

16
00:00:33,494 --> 00:00:35,235
Are you aware that we have security cameras

17
00:00:35,337 --> 00:00:36,436

<i>Is it cool if I at
least come by the apartment</i>

19
00:00:40,309 --> 00:00:42,121

- How's work?

20
00:00:42,413 --> 00:00:45,413
- I quit.
- So what are you gonna do now?

21
00:00:45,566 --> 00:00:47,633
I don't wanna just throw
away everything that we have.

22
00:00:48,207 --> 00:00:49,774
<i>Assalamu alaikum, brother.</i>

23
00:00:49,876 --> 00:00:50,975
My name's Rafiq.

24
00:00:51,243 --> 00:00:53,644
- Ronnie.
- Come by when you ready

25
00:00:53,746 --> 00:00:56,043
- to lay that burden down.
- Said I ain't got no burden.

26
00:00:57,755 --> 00:00:59,082

<i>So how long you been
working for my brother?</i>

31
00:01:08,119 --> 00:01:09,874
- About six months.

32
00:01:10,888 --> 00:01:12,554
<i>I mean, he's your brother.</i>

33

Yeah, why don't you come
sit your bitch ass down?

37
00:01:45,327 --> 00:01:46,365
Yup.

38
00:02:07,207 --> 00:02:09,339
So what is it you'd like to talk about?

39
00:02:09,442 --> 00:02:11,438
I wanna talk about the guns you took.

40
00:02:11,644 --> 00:02:15,136
Ah. Well, see, I had asked Trice a question

41
00:02:15,882 --> 00:02:18,572
which he then decided not to answer.

42
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:20,993
So...

43
00:02:21,788 --> 00:02:23,554
you think I've got his attention now?

44
00:02:23,656 --> 00:02:25,155
You know, he fucked me up real bad

45
00:02:25,257 --> 00:02:26,623
because of your punk ass.

46
00:02:26,725 --> 00:02:29,677
Well, you did fuck up.

47
00:02:30,809 --> 00:02:33,006
Shit, you're lucky.

48
00:02:33,398 --> 00:02:34,806
Back in the day,

49
00:02:34,954 --> 00:02:37,588
I would've curbed your ass
right in front of your old lady.

50
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,557
- Is that right?
- Yes, and then I would've

51
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:42,092
fucked her for good measure.

52
00:02:43,529 --> 00:02:46,899
But shit's a little
different these days, I guess.

53
00:02:47,966 --> 00:02:49,605
You think this a fuckin' game?

54
00:02:50,035 --> 00:02:51,535
What else is it?

55
00:02:54,275 --> 00:02:55,356
So...

56
00:02:56,642 --> 00:02:59,105
you gonna do what your
boss asked you or what?

57
00:03:00,845 --> 00:03:02,277
Fuck you.

58
00:03:02,379 --> 00:03:03,605
Shit.

59
00:03:04,048 --> 00:03:06,682
No, fuck you, rookie.

60
00:03:06,784 --> 00:03:08,380
Shit.

61
00:03:09,153 --> 00:03:10,519
Sonny, Sonny, you okay?

62
00:03:13,677 --> 00:03:16,212
I cannot believe we let this jive turkey

63
00:03:16,313 --> 00:03:18,918
get the drop on both of us.

64
00:03:19,649 --> 00:03:21,149
Oh, stop fuckin' around, Sonny.

65
00:03:21,251 --> 00:03:23,606

- Oh, brother, what the...

68
00:03:46,598 --> 00:03:47,898
Don't "brother" me.

69
00:03:48,274 --> 00:03:51,241
I want you and this piece of fuckin' trash

70
00:03:51,343 --> 00:03:54,017
- out of my establishment.
- All right.

71
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,200
Okay. I just need to call
Tep and JB, all right?

72
00:03:58,926 --> 00:04:00,537
But you need to put that gun down.

73
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,956
You not hearing me.

74
00:04:02,556 --> 00:04:04,225
I want you gone!

75
00:04:06,547 --> 00:04:08,379
You should've never come back.

76
00:04:25,171 --> 00:04:27,765
Damn, girl. Can I get a minute?

77
00:04:31,922 --> 00:04:33,369
The fuck wrong with you?

78
00:04:33,799 --> 00:04:36,006
I get you that cell phone
and this shit happens?

79
00:04:36,108 --> 00:04:38,642
I don't got it. Cops do.

80
00:04:38,965 --> 00:04:40,176
Cops?

81
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:42,213
That shit better not come back on me.

82
00:04:42,315 --> 00:04:43,514
It won't.

83
00:04:45,321 --> 00:04:48,365
- I need another, man.
- Oh, shit.

84
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,491
Five dollars.

85
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:52,528
The last one was three.

86
00:04:52,949 --> 00:04:54,448
This one's five.

87
00:04:55,953 --> 00:04:58,379
Shit, well, this all I got, man.

88
00:04:59,831 --> 00:05:01,499
Give me the shit, man.

89
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:05,057
Oh, shit.

90
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:08,544
Jean! This motherfucker need a doctor.

91
00:05:12,945 --> 00:05:16,096
- He need poultice.
- No, fuck all that voodoo shit.

92
00:05:16,647 --> 00:05:18,414
- Where Chauncy at?
- Sleepin'.

93
00:05:18,516 --> 00:05:19,964
Wake his ass up.

94
00:05:20,351 --> 00:05:22,274
We need his doctorization skills.

95
00:05:26,865 --> 00:05:28,865
Shit, man. Look at this shit.

96
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:35,437
You ever been to the Dells?

97
00:05:37,374 --> 00:05:39,637
- No.
- Up in Wisconsin.

98
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,519
It's beautiful as shit.

99
00:05:43,118 --> 00:05:44,664
If you like walking in the woods,

100
00:05:44,664 --> 00:05:46,297
that's the place to do it.

101
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:48,711
Well, I never walked in the woods.

102
00:05:49,969 --> 00:05:51,001
Fuck are you talking about?

103
00:05:51,104 --> 00:05:52,536
Everybody walk in the woods.

104
00:05:52,638 --> 00:05:56,055
Not me. But I walked in the desert, though.

105
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,395
For what?

106
00:05:59,509 --> 00:06:00,794
I was a soldier.

107
00:06:02,014 --> 00:06:04,281
Yeah, I saw some shit, too, man,

108
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:07,009
I still can't unsee.

109
00:06:07,925 --> 00:06:11,178
I seen some shit in the
Dells. It was dope as fuck.

110
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:15,098
I seen this little deer biting on a bush.

111
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,916
And it was chewing like
this. Weird-ass little chew.

112
00:06:18,703 --> 00:06:21,471
And then there was rain,
but it wasn't like rain-rain.

113
00:06:21,768 --> 00:06:24,190
It was like a light, magical mist

114
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:25,815
falling out of the sky.

115
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:27,915
All of a sudden, a fuckin' frog

116
00:06:28,643 --> 00:06:30,377
landed on my boot.

117
00:06:30,581 --> 00:06:32,981
And more frogs just
kept jumping out, right?

118
00:06:33,084 --> 00:06:34,816
It was like a frog party.
They was everywhere.

119
00:06:34,918 --> 00:06:36,185
They was singing and shit.

120
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:37,669
Freaked me out.

121
00:06:37,989 --> 00:06:41,056
All of a sudden, fuckin'
crows just came out of the sky.

122
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:43,458
Start picking these frogs up...

123
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,955
and eating the fuck out of them.

124
00:06:46,262 --> 00:06:47,595
And at first, I'm
looking at this shit like,

125
00:06:47,697 --> 00:06:49,270
"Man, this is fucked up."

126
00:06:49,566 --> 00:06:51,630
But the frogs was chill as shit.

127
00:06:53,269 --> 00:06:55,136
Seemed like they ain't even care.

128
00:06:57,607 --> 00:07:00,317
That's... that's when I figured it out.

129
00:07:02,411 --> 00:07:03,576
What?

130
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,747
That it's good to be a crow.

131
00:07:09,184 --> 00:07:10,650
What about the deer?

132
00:07:10,752 --> 00:07:12,486
Man, no. Fuck that deer.

133
00:07:12,588 --> 00:07:15,630
Just nibble on a little piece of shrubbery.

134
00:07:17,358 --> 00:07:19,258
Yo, can you fix this motherfucker?

135
00:07:20,027 --> 00:07:21,910
- What for?
- What for?

136
00:07:22,663 --> 00:07:24,819
'Cause you took a oath to help people.

137
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:27,032
And this man right here needs help.

138
00:07:28,603 --> 00:07:30,527
And as a medical practitioner,

139
00:07:30,823 --> 00:07:33,118
it's your duty to help him.

140
00:07:35,739 --> 00:07:36,771
One now.

141
00:07:37,934 --> 00:07:39,780
I'll give you the rest if you fix him.

142
00:07:46,643 --> 00:07:48,245
Let me see.

143
00:07:55,318 --> 00:07:56,550
Ballistic trauma?

144
00:07:56,652 --> 00:07:58,252
We know what the fuck it is.

145
00:07:58,756 --> 00:08:00,053
Can you fix him up?

146
00:08:10,494 --> 00:08:11,673
Morning.

147
00:08:12,495 --> 00:08:14,094
Girl, how long you been
standing right there?

148
00:08:14,195 --> 00:08:16,428
- I just got here.
- It's kinda creepy.

149
00:08:17,637 --> 00:08:19,673
- How'd you sleep?
- Fuckin' terrible.

150
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,706
This couch hard as shit.

151
00:08:21,808 --> 00:08:23,641
- You picked it.
- Yeah, because it looked good,

152
00:08:23,743 --> 00:08:25,909
not because I thought
I'd actually be sleeping

153
00:08:26,012 --> 00:08:27,678
on this motherfucker.

154
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:31,182
Hmm. You hungry?

155
00:08:32,418 --> 00:08:33,935
Yeah, I'll make us something.

156
00:08:34,287 --> 00:08:35,553
I got it.

157
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,555
It's no big deal, really.

158
00:08:37,657 --> 00:08:39,282
That's why I got it.

159
00:08:40,225 --> 00:08:41,958
- Bowls. Uh-oh, here we go.
- Sit.

160
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:44,103
Fancy.

161
00:08:45,999 --> 00:08:47,651
You're such a hater.

162
00:08:52,624 --> 00:08:54,323
So about us, J, what we doing?

163
00:08:54,426 --> 00:08:55,453
Brandon.

164
00:08:57,962 --> 00:08:58,994
For real.

165
00:09:01,633 --> 00:09:03,999
I mean, I told you, all
that stuff is in my past.

166
00:09:04,101 --> 00:09:05,768
It's over. It's done.

167
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:07,474
It's never coming back.

168
00:09:08,373 --> 00:09:10,021
That's why you quit your job?

169
00:09:12,857 --> 00:09:14,173
I told you what happened.

170
00:09:14,411 --> 00:09:15,777
We talked about this.

171
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:17,612
All you wanted was to
get on that line at work

172
00:09:17,714 --> 00:09:20,154
and get some experience under your belt.

173
00:09:21,231 --> 00:09:23,285
And then you just quit like that?

174
00:09:23,387 --> 00:09:24,452
I'm talkin' about us right now.

175
00:09:24,554 --> 00:09:25,820
And so am I.

176
00:09:33,127 --> 00:09:34,742
Do you have something figured out?

177
00:09:39,955 --> 00:09:42,727
Every-everything cost money, J, okay?

178
00:09:43,383 --> 00:09:46,418
What? It would be nice to
start something of my own.

179
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,040
A food truck, something.

180
00:09:49,388 --> 00:09:51,071
But I don't have the money for that.

181
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:54,758
You would if you sign
those papers for the house.

182
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:58,261
What, you think your mom
not gon' sell the house

183
00:09:58,363 --> 00:09:59,705
because you don't sign?

184
00:10:00,065 --> 00:10:02,672
- She can't.
- That's not right, Brandon.

185
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:07,670
Y'all need to talk, 'cause
I have a big inspection

186
00:10:07,772 --> 00:10:09,986
- at the house today.
- Really?

187
00:10:09,986 --> 00:10:11,034
Yes.

188
00:10:12,047 --> 00:10:14,080
There's this investor who's
bought some other properties

189
00:10:14,182 --> 00:10:16,884
in the area, and he just made an offer.

190
00:10:19,573 --> 00:10:21,800
Look, your mother is trying
to have a fresh start.

191
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:24,221
And it's a chance for you to do the same.

192
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:38,989
What up, fool?

193
00:10:39,091 --> 00:10:40,590
Man, turn that shit down.

194
00:10:40,692 --> 00:10:43,059
My whittling music? It's important because

195
00:10:43,161 --> 00:10:45,327
I'm making something special for my moms.

196
00:10:45,609 --> 00:10:47,630
Whatever. We gotta talk about Jake.

197
00:10:47,732 --> 00:10:49,091
<i>What he do now?</i>

198
00:10:50,168 --> 00:10:51,901
He brung that piece to the roller rink.

199
00:10:52,003 --> 00:10:54,224
Yeah. That was messed up.

200
00:10:54,706 --> 00:10:56,229
We gotta do something about it.

201
00:10:56,407 --> 00:10:58,106
<i>Well, I been
praying for him.</i>

202
00:10:58,208 --> 00:10:59,975
Even whittled a cross for him.

203
00:11:00,077 --> 00:11:01,789
<i>Man, he don't need no cross.</i>

204
00:11:02,345 --> 00:11:04,245
<i>How 'bout y'all come
over to my crib,</i>

205
00:11:04,347 --> 00:11:05,614
we game it up a little bit,

206
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:07,338
and then we talk to him about it?

207
00:11:07,841 --> 00:11:10,008
- Now? <i>
- Yeah. Why?</i>

208
00:11:11,121 --> 00:11:13,921
This is sorta my... me time.

209
00:11:14,023 --> 00:11:15,890
Motherfucker, get your ass over here,

210
00:11:15,915 --> 00:11:17,180
and bring Jake.

211
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:20,029
Morning.

212
00:11:23,378 --> 00:11:24,532
You okay?

213
00:11:25,046 --> 00:11:26,936
Huh? Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.

214
00:11:27,682 --> 00:11:29,293
Thought maybe you'd be upset,

215
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:31,819
Tiffany taking EJ back like that.

216
00:11:33,134 --> 00:11:35,367
I mean, it's not normal for a mother

217
00:11:35,469 --> 00:11:37,030
to just leave her child.

218
00:11:37,805 --> 00:11:39,873
Do you know if she's even
okay to take care of him?

219
00:11:39,912 --> 00:11:41,140
Ma, she's fine.

220
00:11:41,241 --> 00:11:42,374
I mean, she be on some crazy stuff,

221
00:11:42,476 --> 00:11:43,700
but she fine.

222
00:11:44,278 --> 00:11:45,610
Did you work something out with her?

223
00:11:45,713 --> 00:11:46,979
Ma, this is, like, the first day

224
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:49,113
in, like, two weeks where I don't

225
00:11:49,215 --> 00:11:51,382
have to push a stroller, I'm off work.

226
00:11:51,484 --> 00:11:53,284
Like, I just wanna take a little vacay.

227
00:11:53,386 --> 00:11:55,153
- Let me enjoy it.
- Oh, vacay.

228
00:11:55,254 --> 00:11:58,047
- Yes.
- He's your boy, not a job.

229
00:12:01,729 --> 00:12:02,761
What?

230
00:12:04,164 --> 00:12:05,589
All right, look.

231
00:12:05,898 --> 00:12:08,343
He's both, all right? I love him to death.

232
00:12:08,533 --> 00:12:10,767
But I need a break. All right?

233
00:12:10,792 --> 00:12:12,492
He was just warming up to you, Emmett.

234
00:12:14,707 --> 00:12:16,272
You know, when I had you,

235
00:12:16,374 --> 00:12:18,093
all my friends were having a good time.

236
00:12:18,811 --> 00:12:19,900
All of 'em.

237
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:23,245
And I was home changing your diapers.

238
00:12:24,849 --> 00:12:26,211
And I don't regret it.

239
00:12:26,796 --> 00:12:28,012
Not one bit.

240
00:12:29,721 --> 00:12:32,374
Neither will you if you
stay consistent in his life.

241
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:35,160
All right.

242
00:12:35,893 --> 00:12:37,151
Thank you.

243
00:12:37,428 --> 00:12:38,888
I'll go check on him.

244
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:41,429
Can I have my phone back?

245
00:12:41,813 --> 00:12:43,172
I guess.

246
00:12:44,067 --> 00:12:45,666
So you not going to work today?

247
00:12:45,769 --> 00:12:47,649
No. I got let go.

248
00:12:48,805 --> 00:12:51,310
What happened?

249
00:12:52,408 --> 00:12:54,189
Nothing you need to worry about.

250
00:12:55,745 --> 00:12:58,011
Place was screwing me out of my hours.

251
00:12:59,448 --> 00:13:01,548
I guess there's something
better for me out there.

252
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:02,727
Okay.

253
00:13:03,619 --> 00:13:05,039
I mean, you-you sure?

254
00:13:05,287 --> 00:13:06,675
Mm-hmm.

255
00:13:09,532 --> 00:13:11,608
- Check on your boy.
- I am.

256
00:13:41,789 --> 00:13:43,357
Thank you, baby.

257
00:13:44,524 --> 00:13:45,731
You're welcome.

258
00:13:46,715 --> 00:13:48,181
I'm sorry it took so long, Ma.

259
00:13:48,283 --> 00:13:50,050
- I...
- I get it. I get it. No, I...

260
00:13:50,152 --> 00:13:51,839
You grew up here. So did I.

261
00:13:56,284 --> 00:13:57,683
So did Coogie.

262
00:13:58,255 --> 00:13:59,859
Hey, where my tea tree oil at?

263
00:14:01,629 --> 00:14:02,929
Yeah, I'm looking at you, son.

264
00:14:03,031 --> 00:14:04,451
I got some shave bumps I gotta soothe.

265
00:14:04,451 --> 00:14:05,850
You check next to your yogurt?

266
00:14:05,953 --> 00:14:07,185
Now, why the hell would I do that?

267
00:14:07,287 --> 00:14:08,720
He just foolin' with you, baby.

268
00:14:08,822 --> 00:14:11,544
I ain't got time for fun.
The inspector's coming.

269
00:14:12,564 --> 00:14:14,067
That's why y'all getting dressed up?

270
00:14:14,067 --> 00:14:16,634
Well, unlike you, I like to
make a good first impression.

271
00:14:16,736 --> 00:14:18,979
Brandon signed the papers
for the house, baby.

272
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,479
Well, it's about time.

273
00:14:20,582 --> 00:14:23,481
Your oil is on the dresser,
right where you left it.

274
00:14:25,485 --> 00:14:26,719
And if you gonna stay for the inspection,

275
00:14:26,821 --> 00:14:28,616
you need to get cleaned up, okay?

276
00:14:29,156 --> 00:14:30,789
Y'all are really taking this serious.

277
00:14:30,891 --> 00:14:32,925
I don't think that the
inspector's gonna care

278
00:14:33,027 --> 00:14:34,459
- what you have on, Mom.
- You know,

279
00:14:34,561 --> 00:14:36,494
if I didn't get Greavy to dress up,

280
00:14:36,597 --> 00:14:38,529
he'd be walking around here
with his nuts swinging out

281
00:14:38,631 --> 00:14:40,331
- beneath his shorts, shit.
- Oh, no.

282
00:14:40,433 --> 00:14:42,466
See, now it's time for me to go.

283
00:14:42,568 --> 00:14:43,774
Bye, Mom.

284
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:45,236
I'll see you later.

285
00:14:45,338 --> 00:14:47,538
- Where you going?
- To Hannibal's.

286
00:14:47,947 --> 00:14:49,380
What you all up to now?

287
00:14:49,482 --> 00:14:50,533
You'll see.

288
00:14:51,284 --> 00:14:53,851
All good things, I tell
you. All good things.

289
00:14:53,953 --> 00:14:55,385
Tell him he need to
stop smoking so much weed

290
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:57,187
so he can remember to call his auntie.

291
00:14:57,289 --> 00:14:58,821
- All right.
- Yeah.

292
00:14:58,924 --> 00:15:00,723
- You feel better now?
- I feel better now.

293
00:15:00,825 --> 00:15:01,958
Mwah.

294
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:07,064
- Yo, Q!
- Yeah.

295
00:15:07,499 --> 00:15:09,132
He getting up.

296
00:15:09,234 --> 00:15:10,402
Hmm.

297
00:15:12,937 --> 00:15:15,067
Nice place you got here, Reg.

298
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,972
What the fuck?

299
00:15:20,178 --> 00:15:21,870
Reggie, Reggie, Reggie.

300
00:15:23,981 --> 00:15:25,747
You know, Reggie, back in my day,

301
00:15:25,849 --> 00:15:27,516
I used to always tell my boys

302
00:15:27,618 --> 00:15:30,101
never to carry their wallets with them.

303
00:15:30,287 --> 00:15:32,420
That way, if the shit went
south and you got grabbed...

304
00:15:32,522 --> 00:15:34,956
You know, by a rival or something...

305
00:15:35,058 --> 00:15:36,769
...they wouldn't know where you lived

306
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:39,837
and your people would be safe.

307
00:15:42,532 --> 00:15:44,102
Who you living with, Reggie?

308
00:15:45,386 --> 00:15:46,441
Nobody.

309
00:15:46,466 --> 00:15:47,513
Nobody.

310
00:15:47,991 --> 00:15:50,061
And that second bedroom
in there, that's for who?

311
00:15:53,209 --> 00:15:54,475
It used to belong to my folks.

312
00:15:54,577 --> 00:15:56,243
Ah, and where are they now?

313
00:15:57,346 --> 00:15:59,379
Pop's doing a bid in Statesville.

314
00:15:59,482 --> 00:16:00,801
Ah, and Moms?

315
00:16:01,584 --> 00:16:03,443
- Gone.
- Mm.

316
00:16:13,394 --> 00:16:14,693
So what now?

317
00:16:16,164 --> 00:16:17,530
I'm thinking on it.

318
00:16:22,169 --> 00:16:24,068
- Go!
- Both of y'all trash.

319
00:16:24,171 --> 00:16:26,104
Don't be talkin' all that.

320
00:16:26,206 --> 00:16:27,439
Bro!

321
00:16:29,075 --> 00:16:30,808
I'm a pro at this game.
I could beat you anyway.

322
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:33,011
Oh, my God, Kev, stop being a spammer.

323
00:16:33,113 --> 00:16:34,212
At least I ain't hackin'.

324
00:16:34,314 --> 00:16:35,680
Yeah, I'm hackin' your mama.

325
00:16:35,782 --> 00:16:37,948
Man, you just mad 'cause
I got natural talent.

326
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:39,138
Whatever.

327
00:16:44,624 --> 00:16:46,960
So, Jake, what you been up to?

328
00:16:47,193 --> 00:16:48,792
Nothin'. Just hangin'.

329
00:16:48,894 --> 00:16:51,562
- With who?
- Reg. You know...

330
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:54,060
- learnin' the game.
- Which game that?

331
00:16:54,162 --> 00:16:55,246
Hustlin'.

332
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:57,085
Why?

333
00:16:57,946 --> 00:16:59,045
You serious?

334
00:17:00,835 --> 00:17:02,485
Look, man, we worried about you.

335
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:05,131
Don't be. 'Bout to get paid.

336
00:17:05,131 --> 00:17:06,531
Paid doing what?

337
00:17:06,952 --> 00:17:08,423
Fuck. Lost.

338
00:17:09,891 --> 00:17:12,269
Shit. Why you two all over me?

339
00:17:12,641 --> 00:17:14,672
- I'm good.
- Yeah, until you're not.

340
00:17:14,773 --> 00:17:16,173
What the fuck that supposed to mean?

341
00:17:16,275 --> 00:17:17,541
Just what the fuck it sound like.

342
00:17:17,566 --> 00:17:18,815
We worried about you.

343
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:20,219
Stanley.

344
00:17:21,769 --> 00:17:23,680
Did I hear that word
come out of your mouth?

345
00:17:23,782 --> 00:17:26,808
Yes, ma'am. I'm very sorry.
It won't happen again.

346
00:17:26,851 --> 00:17:28,137
I know it won't.

347
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:31,353
Kevin, I need you to
run to the grocery store

348
00:17:31,456 --> 00:17:32,721
and get us some things.

349
00:17:32,823 --> 00:17:34,891
- But, Ma, I...
- Come on, Kevin.

350
00:17:38,629 --> 00:17:40,028
You better go before she whup you.

351
00:17:41,832 --> 00:17:43,566
Take your friends with you too.

352
00:17:43,667 --> 00:17:45,333
- Aw, man.
- Damn.

353
00:17:45,435 --> 00:17:46,805
There you go.

354
00:17:48,871 --> 00:17:50,338
Fuck is all that?

355
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,311
Gotta keep you alive, baby.

356
00:17:58,081 --> 00:17:59,647
Have you done this before?

357
00:18:02,384 --> 00:18:03,950
- The fuck?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

358
00:18:04,052 --> 00:18:06,194
Not too much. I need
some of that for later.

359
00:18:07,756 --> 00:18:09,152
This may hurt.

360
00:18:15,364 --> 00:18:17,631
Whoo!

361
00:18:18,054 --> 00:18:19,343
Shit.

362
00:18:24,057 --> 00:18:26,024
That's some MacGyver shit right there.

363
00:18:32,332 --> 00:18:34,275
Wow.

364
00:18:37,871 --> 00:18:39,281
That should hold.

365
00:18:39,606 --> 00:18:41,182
Your body'll do the rest.

366
00:18:41,244 --> 00:18:42,642
My man!

367
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:45,144
- Pills.
- Still got it, huh?

368
00:18:46,261 --> 00:18:47,791
Relax, man.

369
00:18:51,408 --> 00:18:52,697
I think you got a problem.

370
00:19:07,985 --> 00:19:10,531
Miss Ethel? Miss Ethel.

371
00:19:11,678 --> 00:19:14,082
- Miss Ethel.
- What day is it?

372
00:19:14,665 --> 00:19:16,245
Is today your day?

373
00:19:16,245 --> 00:19:18,245
Never mind that. You got
something on the stove?

374
00:19:18,628 --> 00:19:19,732
Oh.

375
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:22,884
Jeez, oh.

376
00:19:27,823 --> 00:19:28,844
Ooh.

377
00:19:30,826 --> 00:19:31,952
Ah, sh...

378
00:19:31,977 --> 00:19:33,076
Fuck.

379
00:19:40,435 --> 00:19:42,269
You didn't smell that burning in here?

380
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:44,169
I must've dozed off for a minute.

381
00:19:44,169 --> 00:19:46,769
You could've burned this whole
house down, with you in it.

382
00:19:47,035 --> 00:19:48,823
Corn bread's ruined.

383
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,416
Where's Ronnie? He should
be helping you with this.

384
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,687
Haven't seen him.

385
00:19:53,688 --> 00:19:55,242
Did you take your medication?

386
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:57,575
Did you eat?

387
00:19:58,490 --> 00:19:59,660
Miss Ethel.

388
00:20:23,645 --> 00:20:24,797
Here.

389
00:20:29,351 --> 00:20:32,168
Look, um, I gotta go now, okay?

390
00:20:32,788 --> 00:20:35,221
Well, if I don't go to glory in my sleep,

391
00:20:35,323 --> 00:20:36,889
I'll see you tomorrow.

392
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:39,859
Go on, now. Stop milking the clock.

393
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:48,614
Listen, Miss Ethel, I need to talk to you.

394
00:20:50,771 --> 00:20:52,270
I came over here to...

395
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:53,908
Well, if it's about my medication,

396
00:20:54,128 --> 00:20:55,447
don't waste your breath.

397
00:20:55,709 --> 00:20:58,710
'Cause I came up with a new
system to help me remember.

398
00:21:04,018 --> 00:21:05,463
No, it's church.

399
00:21:06,386 --> 00:21:09,953
You been asking me, and
I'm finally ready to go.

400
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:11,267
Good.

401
00:21:11,292 --> 00:21:12,491
It's never too late

402
00:21:12,593 --> 00:21:13,525
to get right with Jesus.

403
00:21:13,628 --> 00:21:14,941
Yeah.

404
00:21:15,964 --> 00:21:18,369
Okay, well, we'll talk
about it tomorrow, okay?

405
00:21:18,867 --> 00:21:20,233
- Okay.
- All right.

406
00:21:20,334 --> 00:21:21,868
I put some soup on the counter.

407
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:23,678
Just make sure you heat
it up when you ready.

408
00:21:24,355 --> 00:21:25,947
You get some rest, okay?

409
00:21:26,874 --> 00:21:28,006
Okay.

410
00:21:29,542 --> 00:21:31,314
- Bye.
- Bye.

411
00:21:34,266 --> 00:21:35,385
Meds.

412
00:21:36,984 --> 00:21:39,450
Hey, man, do me a favor and,
uh, spray my babies over here.

413
00:21:39,552 --> 00:21:41,007
- All right.
- Hey, babies.

414
00:21:41,588 --> 00:21:42,721
Beautifuls.

415
00:21:43,257 --> 00:21:45,522
- So why you cut 'em?
- I'm pruning.

416
00:21:45,624 --> 00:21:47,524
If you, uh, cut off the dead leaves,

417
00:21:47,626 --> 00:21:49,326
it allows the plant to grow back stronger

418
00:21:49,428 --> 00:21:50,639
and more potent.

419
00:21:50,963 --> 00:21:52,163
Matter of fact, hand me that, uh, weed,

420
00:21:52,265 --> 00:21:53,588
speaking of potent.

421
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,600
Um, right after we get finished

422
00:21:56,702 --> 00:21:58,135
- talking about this whole...
- Yeah, this food truck.

423
00:21:58,237 --> 00:21:59,670
Yeah, what-what-what...
I don't know shit

424
00:21:59,772 --> 00:22:01,570
- about that, man, like...
- But I do.

425
00:22:01,673 --> 00:22:03,273
- You got a business plan?
- Man, I don't need

426
00:22:03,374 --> 00:22:05,108
no business plan. You my fuckin' cousin.

427
00:22:05,448 --> 00:22:07,065
You asking me for money, right?

428
00:22:07,248 --> 00:22:09,089
Then your ass needs a business plan.

429
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:14,340
All right, well, I can...
I can give you at least half

430
00:22:14,442 --> 00:22:16,475
as soon as we sell the house, for sure.

431
00:22:16,577 --> 00:22:18,109
Man, that shit don't help me now.

432
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:19,744
Plus, the profit on that shit's, what,

433
00:22:19,769 --> 00:22:22,070
like, 15 percent, if you're lucky.

434
00:22:22,249 --> 00:22:23,815
Well, what's the profit on what you doing?

435
00:22:23,917 --> 00:22:25,593
It depends, you know?

436
00:22:32,725 --> 00:22:34,759
- Yeah.
- Who the fuck is that?

437
00:22:34,861 --> 00:22:37,294
- That's Mr. Wu.
- Who is Mr. Wu?

438
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:38,435
My tenant.

439
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:39,599
He live in your closet?

440
00:22:39,624 --> 00:22:40,847
Why are you whispering?

441
00:22:40,847 --> 00:22:42,379
Yes, he lives in the closet.

442
00:22:42,481 --> 00:22:44,015
I mean, you know, in
Asia, the living quarters

443
00:22:44,117 --> 00:22:46,350
are, you know, much
smaller, so it's really like

444
00:22:46,452 --> 00:22:48,215
a fuckin' penthouse in there to him.

445
00:22:50,819 --> 00:22:52,222
He got a flat screen in here.

446
00:22:52,324 --> 00:22:53,890
Yeah, we hooked that shit up
for the Chinese New Year's.

447
00:22:53,992 --> 00:22:55,325
That's crazy.

448
00:22:55,427 --> 00:22:57,594
No, man. It's called being an entrepreneur.

449
00:22:57,837 --> 00:22:59,803
You see, the more streams
of revenue you have coming in

450
00:22:59,906 --> 00:23:02,606
outside of your major hustle,
the more risk you can take.

451
00:23:02,708 --> 00:23:04,842
I'm just trying to get
this one hustle going.

452
00:23:04,944 --> 00:23:06,158
Come on.

453
00:23:09,882 --> 00:23:11,214
All right, man. How much is this

454
00:23:11,316 --> 00:23:13,116
fuckin' food truck gonna cost?

455
00:23:13,218 --> 00:23:14,751
Like, 50,000, 100,000. But it...

456
00:23:14,853 --> 00:23:15,986
- What?
- It's not that bad.

457
00:23:16,088 --> 00:23:17,120
- We could...
- Jesus!

458
00:23:17,222 --> 00:23:18,621
I'ma make that back.

459
00:23:18,723 --> 00:23:19,990
Look, I'm in the middle of diversifying

460
00:23:20,092 --> 00:23:21,157
my portfolio right now,

461
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:23,081
so I'm little cash poor, you dig?

462
00:23:24,196 --> 00:23:25,884
- Damn.
- Yeah, I get it.

463
00:23:27,355 --> 00:23:28,754
I don't know, man. I just...

464
00:23:28,856 --> 00:23:30,446
I just need something that's mine.

465
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:33,447
You know, something for
me. I'd kill that shit.

466
00:23:33,894 --> 00:23:36,251
You know these food trucks
fail most of the time, right?

467
00:23:37,331 --> 00:23:38,597
Mine won't.

468
00:23:38,914 --> 00:23:40,555
My food good as hell.

469
00:23:40,555 --> 00:23:42,421
Plus, it can't. 'Cause if it does,

470
00:23:42,523 --> 00:23:45,006
then I have nothing,
and I can't have nothing.

471
00:23:47,694 --> 00:23:49,294
I already got that shit down pat.

472
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:54,965
I don't know, man. I'm just
trying to be more like you, man.

473
00:23:55,068 --> 00:23:57,445
Just trying to give myself
some opportunities, you know?

474
00:24:02,508 --> 00:24:03,831
I feel you.

475
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:06,911
- Shit gon' work.
- Okay.

476
00:24:07,355 --> 00:24:09,112
Let me see what I can
do. I'ma call my partner,

477
00:24:09,215 --> 00:24:11,915
see if we can hook up something
cheap for us, all right?

478
00:24:12,017 --> 00:24:14,471
- You serious?
- Man, when am I not serious?

479
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:16,886
Is that a real qu...

480
00:24:16,988 --> 00:24:18,588
- Is that a serious question?
- Man, you talkin' shit.

481
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:19,822
I don't know if you being serious now.

482
00:24:19,924 --> 00:24:20,923
You smoke a lot of weed.

483
00:24:21,025 --> 00:24:22,592
Oh, yeah, give me my shit, man.

484
00:24:22,694 --> 00:24:24,093
You know I smoked
outside in the parking lot

485
00:24:24,195 --> 00:24:26,362
before the SATs and I got a 1490?

486
00:24:26,464 --> 00:24:27,430
Hmm? What'd you get?

487
00:24:27,532 --> 00:24:28,831
Huh? What? What was it?

488
00:24:28,933 --> 00:24:30,433
I didn't think so!

489
00:24:30,535 --> 00:24:32,660
Mm-hmm. Smart, and I got
a big, old photogenic dick.

490
00:24:33,003 --> 00:24:34,969
Well, Jerrika doesn't seem to think so.

491
00:24:35,071 --> 00:24:36,804
- Yep.
- Oh, so you back

492
00:24:36,906 --> 00:24:38,940
- fuckin' her now, huh?
- Well, I'm trying.

493
00:24:39,042 --> 00:24:40,308
Uh-huh, yeah. You always been

494
00:24:40,333 --> 00:24:41,866
a domesticating bitch.

495
00:24:48,752 --> 00:24:51,085
Oh, man. Oh, he a wild boy.

496
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:52,978
Oh, he a wild boy.

497
00:24:53,289 --> 00:24:54,821
What the fuck y'all sayin'?

498
00:24:54,923 --> 00:24:55,956
- Huh?
- What are y'all sayin'?

499
00:24:56,058 --> 00:24:57,057
What are y'all talking 'bout?

500
00:24:57,159 --> 00:24:58,125
Oh, he-he called you short.

501
00:24:58,227 --> 00:24:59,360
- He just...
- Yeah.

502
00:24:59,462 --> 00:25:00,594
- What?
- Yeah, we're just talkin' mess.

503
00:25:00,696 --> 00:25:01,928
I'll fuck Mr. Wu up.

504
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:03,330
It's just fuckin' me up

505
00:25:03,432 --> 00:25:04,531
that he lives in your closet, though.

506
00:25:04,634 --> 00:25:05,764
Man, he comfortable too.

507
00:25:16,144 --> 00:25:17,234
Mm-hmm.

508
00:25:28,108 --> 00:25:29,947
You expecting company, Reg?

509
00:25:32,025 --> 00:25:33,616
- No.
- Mm.

510
00:25:34,395 --> 00:25:36,595
Tell me, Reg, what do
you know about me, huh?

511
00:25:38,699 --> 00:25:40,231
You and Trice go back.

512
00:25:40,334 --> 00:25:43,033
Hmm. And then I left

513
00:25:43,135 --> 00:25:44,791
and I put him on.

514
00:25:45,309 --> 00:25:46,660
Did he tell you that?

515
00:25:48,259 --> 00:25:49,626
- He ain't say shit.
- But he did

516
00:25:49,727 --> 00:25:51,393
send you to do me, right?

517
00:25:53,798 --> 00:25:56,944
Reg, as far as Trice is concerned,

518
00:25:57,601 --> 00:26:00,199
you're already damaged goods.

519
00:26:01,304 --> 00:26:02,970
You sure like to talk, old man.

520
00:26:02,995 --> 00:26:05,013
He's already looking for your replacement.

521
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:07,980
And he's probably gonna
find one of your guys

522
00:26:08,411 --> 00:26:10,453
to put one in your back.

523
00:26:12,242 --> 00:26:14,958
Negro, you are disposable.

524
00:26:16,205 --> 00:26:17,303
Is there a point to all of this?

525
00:26:17,405 --> 00:26:18,383
Yes.

526
00:26:19,407 --> 00:26:20,637
That cop.

527
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:23,223
You know, the one I saw Trice with.

528
00:26:23,912 --> 00:26:26,473
- No.
- "No," you don't know?

529
00:26:27,415 --> 00:26:29,282
Or, "No," you don't want to say.

530
00:26:29,384 --> 00:26:31,484
No, fuck you. Fuck is you talkin' 'bout?

531
00:26:33,821 --> 00:26:36,288
Listen, brother, I realize
that you are in a box,

532
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:39,124
but you are going to have to decide,

533
00:26:39,226 --> 00:26:41,827
you know, one way or another
which way you gonna roll.

534
00:26:44,558 --> 00:26:45,810
All righty.

535
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,633
Hey, Tep.

536
00:26:56,991 --> 00:26:58,812
Oh, shit.

537
00:27:00,146 --> 00:27:02,241
Yeah, he scares me too.

538
00:27:03,516 --> 00:27:05,757
Oh. You hungry, Reg?

539
00:27:06,519 --> 00:27:07,551
I-I'm a little bit hungry.

540
00:27:07,653 --> 00:27:08,987
I'm a Li... JB?

541
00:27:08,987 --> 00:27:10,826
Yeah, you mind if we stir up some food?

542
00:27:11,683 --> 00:27:13,449
- Hey, Tep, what we got?
- Pasta.

543
00:27:13,551 --> 00:27:15,640
- That's about it.
- Hell, that works for me.

544
00:27:15,807 --> 00:27:17,204
I love Italian.

545
00:27:30,734 --> 00:27:32,567
Emmett!

546
00:27:34,437 --> 00:27:35,506
Oh.

547
00:27:36,896 --> 00:27:38,677
Here you go.

548
00:27:42,712 --> 00:27:44,437
I gotta get EJ in T-ball.

549
00:27:45,547 --> 00:27:47,414
Ain't he a little young for that?

550
00:27:47,516 --> 00:27:48,923
I mean for when he get older.

551
00:27:49,384 --> 00:27:50,975
My dad didn't put me in shit.

552
00:27:52,154 --> 00:27:54,021
You know, he was around,
but he wasn't there.

553
00:27:54,123 --> 00:27:55,221
You know what I mean?

554
00:27:56,759 --> 00:27:58,360
I know you love EJ.

555
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,495
But real talk, you don't
even know where he at.

556
00:28:01,123 --> 00:28:02,694
Yes, I do. He's with his mama.

557
00:28:02,987 --> 00:28:04,263
And where she at?

558
00:28:04,981 --> 00:28:06,613
She probably with her mama.

559
00:28:07,069 --> 00:28:08,597
You don't even know, do you?

560
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,808
Hold on. Wait.

561
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:16,100
You right. You right.

562
00:28:16,436 --> 00:28:18,669
You right. I tried to give her
a moment, but that's my baby.

563
00:28:18,771 --> 00:28:20,639
She can't just come and take my baby.

564
00:28:24,163 --> 00:28:25,595
Shit, her phone disconnected.

565
00:28:25,698 --> 00:28:27,163
She probably didn't pay her fuckin' bill.

566
00:28:27,316 --> 00:28:28,656
So what you gonna do now?

567
00:28:30,306 --> 00:28:32,739
Uh, come with me. Come with me, yeah.

568
00:28:32,841 --> 00:28:34,273
- We gotta go find...
- No, I ain't going

569
00:28:34,375 --> 00:28:35,475
to that girl house.

570
00:28:35,577 --> 00:28:37,010
I just got my hair done. She not about to

571
00:28:37,112 --> 00:28:38,377
- pull my tracks out.
- It's not even

572
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,846
gonna go that way, come on.

573
00:28:39,948 --> 00:28:41,514
Kiesha, why you being like that?

574
00:28:41,617 --> 00:28:43,432
How 'bout you take me
on a real date next time?

575
00:28:43,885 --> 00:28:45,184
Maybe then I'll consider it.

576
00:28:45,286 --> 00:28:46,826
This is a real date.

577
00:28:47,288 --> 00:28:49,588
I thought this shit through. Hold on.

578
00:28:49,946 --> 00:28:51,058
Hey!

579
00:28:51,547 --> 00:28:52,697
Hold up!

580
00:28:53,349 --> 00:28:55,817
All right, we got the Jays potato chips

581
00:28:55,986 --> 00:28:57,652
and the Dean's ice cream.

582
00:28:57,754 --> 00:28:59,420
All we need is the peanut butter.

583
00:28:59,522 --> 00:29:01,656
- Regular or crunchy?
- My mom likes crunchy.

584
00:29:01,758 --> 00:29:04,158
- Say no more.
- Speaking of your moms,

585
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:06,360
do you call your other mom Moms too?

586
00:29:06,462 --> 00:29:07,928
Nah, I call her Karen.

587
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:09,129
Yeah, how is that?

588
00:29:09,231 --> 00:29:10,411
How's what?

589
00:29:10,699 --> 00:29:12,032
Livin' with two moms.

590
00:29:12,134 --> 00:29:13,389
It's cool.

591
00:29:13,602 --> 00:29:16,136
It's not, like, weird or anything?

592
00:29:16,238 --> 00:29:19,940
Nah. Karen's always been
there ever since I was little.

593
00:29:20,042 --> 00:29:22,208
- She like family.
- Have you ever seen them naked?

594
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:24,610
- Like, together?
- Whoa, what?

595
00:29:24,712 --> 00:29:27,179
No. What? You ever seen your mom naked?

596
00:29:27,281 --> 00:29:29,248
Once. Wasn't what I expected.

597
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:32,018
Man, let's just get out of here
so we can go play some<i> 2K.</i>

598
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,585
Hey, Michael Jordan is my dude.

599
00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:35,554
- You always use Michael.
- You don't know how to use him.

600
00:29:35,657 --> 00:29:37,089
- Yes, I do.
- He gonna be no good

601
00:29:37,191 --> 00:29:38,357
when I dunk on you.

602
00:29:38,459 --> 00:29:40,172
All right, so, uh, we need...

603
00:29:41,795 --> 00:29:42,861
Shit.

604
00:29:42,963 --> 00:29:44,214
What?

605
00:29:48,168 --> 00:29:50,201
Oh, man, did your mom say what kind?

606
00:29:50,303 --> 00:29:52,037
No, it just says "tampons."

607
00:29:52,139 --> 00:29:53,872
Well, being that you have
three women in the house,

608
00:29:53,974 --> 00:29:55,916
there could be a lot of different types.

609
00:29:56,209 --> 00:29:57,708
What the fuck are you talking about?

610
00:29:57,810 --> 00:29:59,309
For example, my mom likes pads,

611
00:29:59,411 --> 00:30:01,912
but my aunt is more of a classic lady.

612
00:30:02,014 --> 00:30:03,580
How the fuck do you know this?

613
00:30:03,683 --> 00:30:05,849
Because I pay attention
when we go shopping.

614
00:30:05,951 --> 00:30:08,052
- Why?
- Knowledge.

615
00:30:08,312 --> 00:30:09,610
What type of knowledge?

616
00:30:09,713 --> 00:30:12,047
My mom say women sync
up when they together.

617
00:30:12,149 --> 00:30:13,715
What the fuck are you talking about?

618
00:30:13,817 --> 00:30:15,816
They get on the same menstrual cycle.

619
00:30:15,841 --> 00:30:17,979
It's nature's way of
achieving balance or something.

620
00:30:20,857 --> 00:30:22,589
Yeah, last night was funny.

621
00:30:22,691 --> 00:30:25,392
Let's just get out of here, all right?

622
00:30:25,417 --> 00:30:26,812
- Seriously.
- All right.

623
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:28,628
What are you doing with my phone?

624
00:30:28,731 --> 00:30:30,564
Checking in with your moms because if you

625
00:30:30,666 --> 00:30:32,698
get this shit wrong, your
ass would be right back here.

626
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,400
And it would be without my ass

627
00:30:34,502 --> 00:30:36,605
because I already did
my 10,000 steps today.

628
00:30:36,872 --> 00:30:37,871
- What?
- Now what the hell

629
00:30:37,973 --> 00:30:39,405
- is you talking about?
- Just chill, bro.

630
00:30:39,507 --> 00:30:40,606
Y'all wanna get out of here?

631
00:30:40,708 --> 00:30:42,018
- Yes.
- Fine.

632
00:30:44,512 --> 00:30:47,313
Hey, Ms. Williams, it's
Papa... I mean, Stanley...

633
00:30:47,415 --> 00:30:48,692
Giving you a call.

634
00:30:48,883 --> 00:30:50,648
We're standing in the
feminine hygiene aisle,

635
00:30:50,751 --> 00:30:54,460
and I was wondering if these are
for you, Kiesha, or the missus.

636
00:30:57,258 --> 00:30:58,757
Okay, I can see how
that's none of my business,

637
00:30:58,859 --> 00:31:01,593
but if you could just
be a bit more specific,

638
00:31:01,695 --> 00:31:03,003
it would be helpful.

639
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:06,056
- Playing too much.
- The applicator. Okay.

640
00:31:06,565 --> 00:31:08,301
Super plus and slender?

641
00:31:09,235 --> 00:31:10,396
Okay.

642
00:31:11,504 --> 00:31:13,004
Scented or unscented?

643
00:31:13,106 --> 00:31:14,571
Yeah, I got those.

644
00:31:14,673 --> 00:31:16,874
I hear cardboard can
be rough, so do you want

645
00:31:16,976 --> 00:31:18,290
the plastic applicator?

646
00:31:19,379 --> 00:31:20,854
Yeah, I can just shut up.

647
00:31:21,447 --> 00:31:23,193
Are there any other products you want?

648
00:31:23,888 --> 00:31:25,404
You're welcome. Bye.

649
00:31:25,784 --> 00:31:27,217
- We good?
- So?

650
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:28,618
We're all good, man. Let's get out of here.

651
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,253
Thank God.

652
00:31:30,355 --> 00:31:31,788
That lady was looking at us weird.

653
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,390
You think she knew we was tampon shoppin'?

654
00:31:33,491 --> 00:31:34,689
Whatever.

655
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:39,847
Yeah.

656
00:31:40,497 --> 00:31:42,364
Man, did I tell y'all, when I was little,

657
00:31:42,466 --> 00:31:44,233
I wanted to be a astronaut?

658
00:31:44,258 --> 00:31:45,527
Can you believe that shit?

659
00:31:45,903 --> 00:31:47,569
What you wanted to be, Ronnie?

660
00:31:47,671 --> 00:31:48,770
I don't remember.

661
00:31:48,872 --> 00:31:49,905
Let me guess.

662
00:31:50,007 --> 00:31:51,693
Kung fu master.

663
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:54,049
No. I'm just playin'.

664
00:31:54,678 --> 00:31:56,686
Probably wanted to be
something boring as shit.

665
00:31:57,376 --> 00:31:59,075
Like a mailman, right?

666
00:31:59,161 --> 00:32:01,395
Biggest worry is getting chased

667
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,221
by a fuckin' Chihuahua.

668
00:32:03,299 --> 00:32:04,599
I don't wanna talk about it.

669
00:32:04,701 --> 00:32:06,467
Come on, Ronnie. Damn.

670
00:32:06,569 --> 00:32:07,917
We bonding here.

671
00:32:09,038 --> 00:32:10,666
Tell 'em what you wanted to be.

672
00:32:10,666 --> 00:32:11,801
A cobbler.

673
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:14,212
This motherfucker wanted to
make women's shoes and shit.

674
00:32:14,528 --> 00:32:16,094
- That's right?
- That's right.

675
00:32:16,119 --> 00:32:17,323
Hell yeah.

676
00:32:18,412 --> 00:32:20,545
I bet Chauncy here wanted to be a doctor.

677
00:32:20,646 --> 00:32:22,979
And bam! Smart motherfucker got up,

678
00:32:23,082 --> 00:32:25,149
took his ass to school,
and became a doctor.

679
00:32:25,251 --> 00:32:26,616
Radiologist.

680
00:32:26,718 --> 00:32:28,168
That's still a doctor.

681
00:32:29,048 --> 00:32:30,354
Eight years of med school.

682
00:32:30,456 --> 00:32:31,745
One-year internship.

683
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:33,830
Four years' residency.

684
00:32:34,259 --> 00:32:35,677
Shit, that's it?

685
00:32:35,974 --> 00:32:38,341
I could be a gynecologist,
then. Ain't that right, Jean?

686
00:32:38,443 --> 00:32:39,775
- Yeah.
- Come on, Ronnie.

687
00:32:39,878 --> 00:32:41,144
What's up, man?

688
00:32:41,246 --> 00:32:42,545
What you wanted to be?

689
00:33:11,984 --> 00:33:13,975
You got some nerve

690
00:33:14,077 --> 00:33:15,276
comin' all up in here.

691
00:33:15,378 --> 00:33:17,278
Ms. Bryant, wh-where's Tiffany at?

692
00:33:17,728 --> 00:33:19,914
- She ain't here.
- Ms. Bryant, please.

693
00:33:20,367 --> 00:33:21,733
Listen, I'm trying to
be a good father here.

694
00:33:21,835 --> 00:33:23,311
I'm trying to do the right thing.

695
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:27,438
Don't you got two other
kids by two different women?

696
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:28,805
- Where they at?
- What's that got to...

697
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:33,025
They out of state with they mamas.

698
00:33:33,412 --> 00:33:35,062
We FaceTime sometimes.

699
00:33:35,548 --> 00:33:38,249
So you mostly a digital daddy, then.

700
00:33:38,351 --> 00:33:39,912
Listen, I just miss my boy.

701
00:33:40,752 --> 00:33:42,569
I miss him. I wanna see him.

702
00:33:43,221 --> 00:33:44,448
I wanna hold him.

703
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:46,122
Look, I can't tell you where Tiffany is

704
00:33:46,224 --> 00:33:47,557
'cause she don't want nobody to know.

705
00:33:47,659 --> 00:33:49,125
Well, how come she don't want me to know?

706
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:51,628
That said, I never promised

707
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:53,763
not to tell nobody where EJ at.

708
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,633
All right, cuz. I want
you to be open-minded.

709
00:33:57,735 --> 00:33:58,967
All right? That's all I'm asking.

710
00:33:59,069 --> 00:34:00,502
When am I not open-minded?

711
00:34:00,604 --> 00:34:03,138
Them two Spanish girls

712
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,947
from the Crane Club back in the day?

713
00:34:06,477 --> 00:34:08,042
You talkin' 'bout the...

714
00:34:08,145 --> 00:34:09,568
They was drag queens.

715
00:34:10,013 --> 00:34:11,880
See? Judging.

716
00:34:11,982 --> 00:34:13,547
And limiting yourself.

717
00:34:14,684 --> 00:34:16,816
Here she is!

718
00:34:21,891 --> 00:34:23,857
All right, now, before
you shit all over it,

719
00:34:23,959 --> 00:34:25,466
- it's...
- I love it.

720
00:34:26,329 --> 00:34:28,372
- Huh?
- I love it.

721
00:34:28,864 --> 00:34:30,930
- For real?
- Hell yeah.

722
00:34:31,032 --> 00:34:32,799
I mean, it ain't exactly
what I had in mind,

723
00:34:32,824 --> 00:34:34,738
but this can definitely work.

724
00:34:35,821 --> 00:34:37,671
Even the-the whole "Lick Me" thing?

725
00:34:37,773 --> 00:34:39,161
- This?
- Yeah.

726
00:34:39,441 --> 00:34:40,674
Oh, no. This is terrible.

727
00:34:40,776 --> 00:34:42,409
But, I mean, with a lot of paint

728
00:34:42,511 --> 00:34:44,911
and, like, a lot of work,
I could make this dope.

729
00:34:45,283 --> 00:34:46,549
- It's gonna be dope.
- That's what I'm...

730
00:34:46,574 --> 00:34:47,860
I like to hear that. Good.

731
00:34:48,374 --> 00:34:50,206
How 'bout you take it for a spin, then?

732
00:34:50,408 --> 00:34:51,638
This the keys?

733
00:34:51,942 --> 00:34:53,271
I mean, yeah. It's...

734
00:34:56,247 --> 00:34:57,680
- Ah.
- Oh, man,

735
00:34:57,705 --> 00:34:59,204
I love you so much, man.

736
00:34:59,229 --> 00:35:00,942
Hey. I love you too, man.

737
00:35:01,386 --> 00:35:03,318
- I owe you big.
- Yeah, you do.

738
00:35:03,421 --> 00:35:04,753
My share. All right?

739
00:35:04,855 --> 00:35:06,688
- All right.
- Hit me up.

740
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:08,087
Hey, where you goin'?

741
00:35:08,859 --> 00:35:10,421
You ain't gonna take a ride with me?

742
00:35:11,115 --> 00:35:13,128
Oh, no, I'm... No, I'm good.

743
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:14,629
Really?

744
00:35:14,731 --> 00:35:16,211
Man, I can't be seen in this shit.

745
00:35:16,211 --> 00:35:17,832
Why you throwing shade, dog?

746
00:35:17,934 --> 00:35:19,000
I'm not, man. I got nothin'

747
00:35:19,102 --> 00:35:20,284
but love for you, kid.

748
00:35:20,285 --> 00:35:21,602
But I'ma-I'ma be a silent partner.

749
00:35:21,704 --> 00:35:23,036
This is all you. All right?

750
00:35:23,138 --> 00:35:24,505
Hit me when the money start coming in.

751
00:35:24,607 --> 00:35:25,672
- Okay?
- All right?

752
00:35:25,697 --> 00:35:26,618
All right?

753
00:35:30,245 --> 00:35:31,387
What?

754
00:35:31,672 --> 00:35:33,853
This is crazy.

755
00:35:34,904 --> 00:35:36,182
Yes!

756
00:35:36,285 --> 00:35:37,350
How you doin'?

757
00:35:37,453 --> 00:35:39,013
What can I help you guys with?

758
00:35:41,956 --> 00:35:44,390
How that pill count comin'?
We gotta move this tonight.

759
00:35:44,492 --> 00:35:46,325
Got enough to keep the
whole South Side lit.

760
00:35:46,428 --> 00:35:47,795
Oh, that's dope.

761
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:51,071
Hey, y'all need to wake up.

762
00:35:51,764 --> 00:35:53,381
Rise and shine.

763
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,435
Come on, Doc. Get up.

764
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,703
Chauncy!

765
00:35:58,806 --> 00:36:00,705
Shit!

766
00:36:00,808 --> 00:36:01,963
Jean!

767
00:36:05,579 --> 00:36:07,312
This motherfucker done crossed over.

768
00:36:07,414 --> 00:36:09,815
No, we was just talkin'.

769
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:12,059
I can't have no dead people in here.

770
00:36:12,518 --> 00:36:14,885
- He gonna go zombie on us.
- Hey, man, relax!

771
00:36:14,987 --> 00:36:16,491
He ain't even turn yet.

772
00:36:18,307 --> 00:36:20,602
- Where you goin'?
- I ain't takin' no chances.

773
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,840
You gonna get him out of here.

774
00:36:23,865 --> 00:36:25,932
- What?
- Yeah.

775
00:36:25,977 --> 00:36:28,167
I'm cashing in that motherfuckin' chip.

776
00:36:28,349 --> 00:36:31,073
Plus, he patched up your dying ass.

777
00:36:35,848 --> 00:36:37,439
No, man.

778
00:36:38,994 --> 00:36:40,300
Shit!

779
00:36:49,337 --> 00:36:51,904
Man, slow the fuck down. Shit.

780
00:37:01,139 --> 00:37:02,627
Bring your ass on, man.

781
00:37:02,834 --> 00:37:04,815
Y'all bringing my property value down.

782
00:37:17,597 --> 00:37:19,064
And where am I supposed to put him?

783
00:37:19,166 --> 00:37:20,661
You put him anywhere you want to.

784
00:37:20,661 --> 00:37:21,993
Just away from here.

785
00:37:23,718 --> 00:37:25,735
And hurry your ass up before he turn.

786
00:37:26,347 --> 00:37:27,422
Come on, man.

787
00:37:29,537 --> 00:37:31,099
Shit.

788
00:38:08,173 --> 00:38:09,573
I don't care what y'all talkin' 'bout.

789
00:38:09,675 --> 00:38:11,341
- Shorty was bad.
- But you know

790
00:38:11,442 --> 00:38:12,875
- you weren't getting her.
- Why y'all hatin'?

791
00:38:12,977 --> 00:38:14,109
I mean, if I was talking to her,

792
00:38:14,211 --> 00:38:15,544
it would have been a different story.

793
00:38:15,646 --> 00:38:17,112
- Man, shut up.
- Man, stop hating.

794
00:38:17,214 --> 00:38:18,732
Man, you just mad 'cause
your shorty can't pull her.

795
00:38:20,925 --> 00:38:21,971
Y'all ain't coming in?

796
00:38:21,996 --> 00:38:24,242
Nah, your mom seemed
stressed out on the phone,

797
00:38:24,267 --> 00:38:25,867
so I'm gon' bounce.

798
00:38:25,969 --> 00:38:28,467
Yeah, me too. I got shit to do.

799
00:38:29,404 --> 00:38:30,633
What type of shit?

800
00:38:32,153 --> 00:38:33,406
What's up with all the questions?

801
00:38:33,508 --> 00:38:35,108
We just don't want
anything to happen to you.

802
00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:36,643
Ain't nothin' gon' happen.

803
00:38:36,668 --> 00:38:38,101
- Reg looks out for me.
- That don't mean

804
00:38:38,131 --> 00:38:39,697
- he could always protect you.
- I'm good.

805
00:38:39,729 --> 00:38:41,262
- You're not good.
- Me?

806
00:38:41,583 --> 00:38:43,551
You the motherfucker that shot somebody.

807
00:38:47,521 --> 00:38:48,754
I'm out of here.

808
00:38:51,535 --> 00:38:52,902
Man, what the fuck he talkin' 'bout?

809
00:38:52,927 --> 00:38:53,935
Nothin'.

810
00:38:55,196 --> 00:38:57,564
Friends don't keep
secrets from one another.

811
00:38:57,999 --> 00:38:59,645
Not real ones.

812
00:39:01,402 --> 00:39:02,715
Papa.

813
00:39:34,966 --> 00:39:36,085
Tiffany.

814
00:39:39,824 --> 00:39:40,736
Tiff?

815
00:39:41,873 --> 00:39:43,272
I've been trying to call you.

816
00:39:46,744 --> 00:39:48,510
Tiffany, who-who house is this?

817
00:39:48,612 --> 00:39:50,847
Let me guess, your mama must've
told you to come find him.

818
00:39:50,949 --> 00:39:52,648
No, I wanted to see him.

819
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:54,703
Why you got my son in some random house?

820
00:39:54,885 --> 00:39:56,184
Huh? And why the door open?

821
00:39:56,286 --> 00:39:57,652
A month ago, I couldn't even get you

822
00:39:57,754 --> 00:39:59,721
- to acknowledge he was yours.
- What?

823
00:40:00,121 --> 00:40:01,987
So you think you can just
jump in and out of his life

824
00:40:02,089 --> 00:40:03,389
whenever you fuckin' feel like it?

825
00:40:04,972 --> 00:40:06,404
Did it ever occur to
you that I might've been

826
00:40:06,429 --> 00:40:07,795
going through something myself?

827
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:09,748
I don't know. You wasn't
answering the phone.

828
00:40:09,964 --> 00:40:11,396
What kinda mom just
come in and just show up

829
00:40:11,498 --> 00:40:12,764
- whenever she feel?
- Look, don't act like

830
00:40:12,789 --> 00:40:14,122
you some father of the year

831
00:40:14,147 --> 00:40:15,179
'cause you had him for two weeks.

832
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:16,415
I had him for two years

833
00:40:16,729 --> 00:40:18,396
with no help from you, Emmett.

834
00:40:18,466 --> 00:40:19,837
I been helping, all right?

835
00:40:19,939 --> 00:40:21,411
I been-I been payin'
for-for day care,

836
00:40:21,411 --> 00:40:22,513
Pull-Ups and shit.

837
00:40:22,513 --> 00:40:24,536
Good. I hope you plan on keeping that up.

838
00:40:25,496 --> 00:40:27,096
Fuck you, Tiffany. I'm-I'm
grabbing the diaper bag

839
00:40:27,199 --> 00:40:28,630
- and I'm goin'.
- You can't just take him

840
00:40:28,732 --> 00:40:29,998
'cause you feel like it, Emmett.

841
00:40:30,101 --> 00:40:31,534
Move, move.

842
00:40:31,635 --> 00:40:33,369
All right, this is my
son too. I got rights.

843
00:40:33,394 --> 00:40:35,039
- No, you don't.
- How not?

844
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:37,239
If you start paying some child support,

845
00:40:37,341 --> 00:40:39,308
then we'll talk about visitation rights.

846
00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:40,876
- Child support?
- Child support.

847
00:40:40,978 --> 00:40:42,545
You gonna hold some money over my kid head?

848
00:40:42,646 --> 00:40:44,012
I... that ain't right.

849
00:40:44,115 --> 00:40:46,381
I make minimum wage and I'm in school.

850
00:40:46,483 --> 00:40:47,982
Food, rent, diapers, day care.

851
00:40:48,085 --> 00:40:49,650
It's all on me, Emmett.

852
00:40:49,752 --> 00:40:51,419
You spend your money on Jordans and Yeezys.

853
00:40:51,521 --> 00:40:52,920
Tiffany, I'm not about to fight with you.

854
00:40:53,022 --> 00:40:54,589
All I wanna see is my boy.

855
00:40:54,691 --> 00:40:56,616
What you can do is put
some money in our pocket.

856
00:40:57,064 --> 00:40:58,330
- Our pocket?
- That's what you can do.

857
00:40:58,432 --> 00:40:59,564
No, your pocket. You want me to put

858
00:40:59,667 --> 00:41:00,732
some money in your pocket.

859
00:41:00,835 --> 00:41:02,134
- You don't get it.
- Tiffany, I'm not about to...

860
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:03,457
- Stay away from my baby.
- Stop trying

861
00:41:03,482 --> 00:41:04,616
- to get strong with me.
- Or I'ma call the police.

862
00:41:04,616 --> 00:41:05,748
- Police?
- Yes.

863
00:41:05,850 --> 00:41:06,949
You gonna call the police on me?

864
00:41:07,052 --> 00:41:08,518
Everything all right, baby?

865
00:41:13,791 --> 00:41:14,977
Huh?

866
00:41:20,364 --> 00:41:21,755
Just go, Emmett.

867
00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:27,469
Okay.

868
00:41:34,111 --> 00:41:35,710
Shh. Okay.

869
00:41:35,812 --> 00:41:37,238
You're okay.

870
00:41:59,234 --> 00:42:02,735
Mmm, now, this not bad, Tep, considerin'.

871
00:42:02,837 --> 00:42:04,204
Could've used some chili powder.

872
00:42:04,306 --> 00:42:05,280
Yeah.

873
00:42:08,711 --> 00:42:12,111
So, Reggie, I really need you
to tell me who killed that kid.

874
00:42:12,213 --> 00:42:14,246
You know, the star basketball player

875
00:42:14,348 --> 00:42:15,281
up near your stash house.

876
00:42:15,383 --> 00:42:16,599
I don't know.

877
00:42:16,850 --> 00:42:19,481
On my granny's soul, I have no idea.

878
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:20,886
Mm.

879
00:42:28,795 --> 00:42:29,961
No, no, no! Please, hey!

880
00:42:29,986 --> 00:42:31,152
Sit down.

881
00:42:42,576 --> 00:42:45,137
- It's all good.
- Yes, yes. It is all good.

882
00:42:46,437 --> 00:42:48,678
We've met before, right?

883
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:50,465
You remember, the block party.

884
00:42:50,782 --> 00:42:52,682
What's your name, little man?

885
00:42:54,953 --> 00:42:56,520
- Jake.
- Jake.

886
00:42:56,622 --> 00:42:58,388
Jake, and I'll bet that you would be

887
00:42:58,413 --> 00:42:59,978
Reggie's little brother, right?

888
00:43:00,422 --> 00:43:02,024
- Yeah.
- Yeah, well, it seems

889
00:43:02,072 --> 00:43:04,475
Reggie forgot to tell us about you.

890
00:43:07,064 --> 00:43:10,433
You know, I thought you was
just running with him that night,

891
00:43:10,458 --> 00:43:12,991
but now that I know you're blood...

892
00:43:20,110 --> 00:43:21,910
So, Jake, what school you go to?

893
00:43:22,834 --> 00:43:24,066
I go to Hopkins.

894
00:43:24,091 --> 00:43:26,091
Well, Jake from Hopkins...

895
00:43:26,116 --> 00:43:28,082
...I'm gonna need you
to do something for me.

896
00:43:31,384 --> 00:43:32,441
What?

897
00:43:36,473 --> 00:43:38,548
Toss that in the sink for me.

898
00:43:39,513 --> 00:43:40,677
Over there.

899
00:43:49,889 --> 00:43:51,965
Yo, Reg, sit down.

900
00:43:55,743 --> 00:43:59,612
You know, you should be
very proud of that young man.

901
00:43:59,714 --> 00:44:01,381
You know, he could go places.

902
00:44:01,694 --> 00:44:03,983
All you need to do is keep
him out of trouble and...

903
00:44:04,085 --> 00:44:05,307
and alive.

904
00:44:06,988 --> 00:44:09,194
So about that cop again.

905
00:44:09,756 --> 00:44:12,057
Are you suddenly remembering anything?

906
00:44:19,294 --> 00:44:21,934
- Some dude named Wallace.
- Wallace, Wallace.

907
00:44:22,035 --> 00:44:23,868
Does Trice got him in pocket?

908
00:44:23,970 --> 00:44:26,337
Mm-hmm. He get a taste of everything.

909
00:44:26,817 --> 00:44:28,684
In return, he make sure
we don't get jammed up.

910
00:44:28,786 --> 00:44:30,958
Mm, yeah. Yeah.

911
00:44:32,785 --> 00:44:34,322
How 'bout the kid, the basketball player?

912
00:44:34,424 --> 00:44:35,739
You remember anything about him?

913
00:44:36,594 --> 00:44:38,575
Ain't nobody said shit about that.

914
00:44:41,065 --> 00:44:42,537
I'm dead-ass serious.

915
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:52,916
Just tell me what you want me to do.

916
00:44:57,470 --> 00:44:58,669
Come here.

917
00:45:03,207 --> 00:45:05,170
Okay. You keep that between us.

918
00:45:11,093 --> 00:45:12,335
Gentlemen.

919
00:45:16,098 --> 00:45:19,231
Ah. Hey, Jake.

920
00:45:21,636 --> 00:45:23,148
Stay healthy, little man.

921
00:45:34,481 --> 00:45:35,723
Shit.

922
00:46:24,729 --> 00:46:25,902
Chauncy?

923
00:46:27,931 --> 00:46:29,337
Chauncy, wake up.

924
00:46:29,866 --> 00:46:30,989
Wake up.

925
00:46:32,918 --> 00:46:34,105
Chauncy?

926
00:46:37,607 --> 00:46:38,848
Oh, my God.

927
00:46:39,710 --> 00:46:42,470
No. No!

928
00:46:44,257 --> 00:46:46,772
No!

929
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:48,204
Mom?

930
00:46:49,203 --> 00:46:51,551
Chauncy.

931
00:46:53,723 --> 00:46:55,605
Don't look. No!

932
00:47:03,397 --> 00:47:04,891
Oh, God.

933
00:47:16,856 --> 00:47:18,778
J!

934
00:47:26,787 --> 00:47:27,932
What do you think?

935
00:47:28,983 --> 00:47:30,291
It's dope, right?

936
00:47:30,457 --> 00:47:32,157
What's with the tongue?

937
00:47:32,789 --> 00:47:33,991
Try not to look at the tongue.

938
00:47:34,093 --> 00:47:35,459
- Not the tongue.
- Oh, that's...

939
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:36,761
Everything else probably,
but not the tongue.

940
00:47:36,863 --> 00:47:37,928
That's just a little bit hard.

941
00:47:38,030 --> 00:47:39,230
It's gonna be great, all right?

942
00:47:39,331 --> 00:47:40,798
'Cause I'ma put a stove
and a grill right here

943
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:42,032
where the freezer is already, right?

944
00:47:42,135 --> 00:47:43,333
- Mm-hmm.
- And then up top,

945
00:47:43,435 --> 00:47:44,635
it's just gonna have a bunch of storage

946
00:47:44,737 --> 00:47:46,003
for, like, all my supplies.

947
00:47:46,105 --> 00:47:47,838
Easy access. I got a couple coolers in here

948
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:49,606
'cause, I mean, it's an ice cream truck.

949
00:47:49,708 --> 00:47:52,090
You know, so I don't lose no perishables.

950
00:47:52,129 --> 00:47:53,395
I don't have to put my stuff on ice

951
00:47:53,497 --> 00:47:54,740
like I thought I would.

952
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:55,807
But it gets better. Check it out.

953
00:47:57,510 --> 00:47:58,540
So...

954
00:47:59,779 --> 00:48:00,845
see the vision.

955
00:48:00,947 --> 00:48:02,479
- All black...
- Mm-hmm.

956
00:48:02,896 --> 00:48:05,149
...red trim, new rims and tires,

957
00:48:05,251 --> 00:48:06,550
tinted windows.

958
00:48:06,912 --> 00:48:08,177
- Right?
- Mm-hmm.

959
00:48:09,421 --> 00:48:11,688
And I think I'ma call it Bust a Taco.

960
00:48:11,973 --> 00:48:13,156
Bust a Taco?

961
00:48:13,258 --> 00:48:16,633
Yeah, just think Mexican meets soul food.

962
00:48:18,663 --> 00:48:20,363
- I like it.
- Ah, see?

963
00:48:22,901 --> 00:48:24,256
Just...

964
00:48:25,091 --> 00:48:27,636
...it's gonna take a lot of TLC.

965
00:48:27,961 --> 00:48:29,311
Yeah, it does need a little help.

966
00:48:29,311 --> 00:48:30,785
But I'm willing to do it.

967
00:48:33,204 --> 00:48:35,152
I'm actually really excited to do it.

968
00:48:37,852 --> 00:48:40,633
I'm just glad to see you happy and...

969
00:48:42,241 --> 00:48:44,207
doing what you wanna do.

970
00:48:50,383 --> 00:48:52,489
I ain't doin' it yet. Not without you.

971
00:48:55,497 --> 00:48:56,797
Okay, baby, look,

972
00:48:56,822 --> 00:49:00,031
I know I can't take back what I did.

973
00:49:02,362 --> 00:49:03,736
But it'll never happen again.

974
00:49:03,838 --> 00:49:04,837
I can promise you that.

975
00:49:05,207 --> 00:49:06,267
I know.

976
00:49:06,641 --> 00:49:08,774
And I'll do whatever it
takes for you to trust me.

977
00:49:11,279 --> 00:49:12,812
'Cause all this is great,

978
00:49:12,914 --> 00:49:14,513
but it's nothing if
you're not there with me.

979
00:49:35,768 --> 00:49:38,202
- I take you in my truck.
- No!

980
00:49:45,211 --> 00:49:46,750
Assalamu alaikum.

981
00:49:47,746 --> 00:49:48,743
Thank you.

982
00:49:48,881 --> 00:49:50,113
Let me welcome you.

983
00:50:05,130 --> 00:50:06,383
Come on in, brother.

984
00:50:09,233 --> 00:50:10,613
How you been?

985
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:12,368
All right.

986
00:50:12,470 --> 00:50:14,470
If you don't mind taking those shoes off.

987
00:50:21,245 --> 00:50:22,548
So what's going on?

988
00:50:25,015 --> 00:50:26,984
You tell me.

989
00:50:32,688 --> 00:50:34,100
You kill somebody?

990
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:38,725
Just between me and you.

991
00:50:41,196 --> 00:50:42,599
You got shot.

992
00:50:43,171 --> 00:50:45,037
Yeah, so?

993
00:50:50,016 --> 00:50:51,570
You ain't gotta front for me.

994
00:50:52,052 --> 00:50:53,444
I been you.

995
00:50:56,657 --> 00:50:57,889
Was this your first time?

996
00:50:57,991 --> 00:50:59,047
Shit.

997
00:50:59,858 --> 00:51:01,707
I ain't come here for this, man.

998
00:51:01,707 --> 00:51:03,364
Then why'd you come here?

999
00:51:06,717 --> 00:51:08,264
I don't know.

1000
00:51:09,464 --> 00:51:10,759
Have a seat, brother.

1001
00:51:13,937 --> 00:51:15,303
You welcome.

1002
00:51:29,647 --> 00:51:31,587
When I was 19 years old,

1003
00:51:33,531 --> 00:51:35,674
I was kicking it with some of my guys

1004
00:51:35,977 --> 00:51:37,725
around 85th and Stony.

1005
00:51:38,613 --> 00:51:39,805
This party.

1006
00:51:41,353 --> 00:51:43,313
We got into it with these dudes.

1007
00:51:45,479 --> 00:51:46,909
I wanted to get them up off us,

1008
00:51:46,934 --> 00:51:49,447
so I pulled out a pistol.

1009
00:51:51,696 --> 00:51:52,882
One shot.

1010
00:51:55,501 --> 00:51:57,298
Went through the window of a house.

1011
00:52:00,434 --> 00:52:01,952
Killed a little girl.

1012
00:52:02,669 --> 00:52:04,081
Seven years old.

1013
00:52:06,534 --> 00:52:08,040
I took her from her mother.

1014
00:52:08,927 --> 00:52:10,695
I took her from her father.

1015
00:52:15,389 --> 00:52:16,599
Her life.

1016
00:52:18,203 --> 00:52:19,367
For what?

1017
00:52:22,207 --> 00:52:23,605
When I first got locked up,

1018
00:52:24,475 --> 00:52:26,709
I wasn't even thinkin' how bad it was,

1019
00:52:26,734 --> 00:52:27,820
what I did.

1020
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,967
I didn't wanna carry that weight.

1021
00:52:33,528 --> 00:52:35,691
You know, once I got inside, I couldn't...

1022
00:52:36,487 --> 00:52:37,726
couldn't sleep.

1023
00:52:38,523 --> 00:52:39,875
I couldn't think.

1024
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:42,201
It was hard for me to eat.

1025
00:52:43,975 --> 00:52:46,075
I didn't know how to
express what I was feeling.

1026
00:52:49,198 --> 00:52:52,022
The block don't teach you how
to express that pain, do it?

1027
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:56,103
One day on the yard,
this brother came up to me

1028
00:52:56,128 --> 00:52:58,219
and asked me the same question I asked you.

1029
00:52:59,274 --> 00:53:01,159
He saw I was carrying something.

1030
00:53:02,878 --> 00:53:04,455
This brother name was Malik.

1031
00:53:05,981 --> 00:53:08,257
He helped me come to terms with myself

1032
00:53:09,585 --> 00:53:10,879
through Allah.

1033
00:53:12,154 --> 00:53:14,415
And it's through Allah's grace and mercy

1034
00:53:14,743 --> 00:53:16,397
that I'm on the right path.

1035
00:53:24,799 --> 00:53:28,685
Brother, Allah is
all-knowing and all-seeing

1036
00:53:29,329 --> 00:53:31,441
but most forgiving and most merciful.

1037
00:53:32,465 --> 00:53:33,885
<i>Alhamdulillah.</i>

1038
