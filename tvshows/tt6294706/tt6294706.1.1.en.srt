00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,234
Come on, sweep.

3
00:00:56,259 --> 00:00:57,797
I'm running late to school.

4
00:00:57,883 --> 00:00:59,507
Ah, no, no, no. We are closed. No.

5
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:01,928
- Let me get a grape pop.
- You got money?

6
00:01:01,961 --> 00:01:03,672
Man, you know I'm good for it, Amir.

7
00:01:03,711 --> 00:01:05,552
- Grape pop?
- Yeah, and some of that jerky.

00:01:06,597 --> 00:01:08,485
- What's up, man?
- $1 for the pop,

9
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:10,182
$1.75 for the jerky.

10
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:12,619
- Wait, how much pop cost?
- Dollar.

11
00:01:12,619 --> 00:01:14,261
How much it cost you, wholesale?

12
00:01:14,286 --> 00:01:15,422
17¢.

13
00:01:16,003 --> 00:01:19,006
Okay, so I give you a quarter
and that's like 8¢ profit, man.

14
00:01:19,031 --> 00:01:20,258
How you lose on that?

15
00:01:20,283 --> 00:01:21,493
Everybody else pay a dollar.

16
00:01:21,518 --> 00:01:23,448
Habib, listen, man, check this out.

17
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:24,979
I give you a quarter for the pop

18
00:01:24,979 --> 00:01:26,606
and I pay full price for the jerky

19
00:01:26,642 --> 00:01:28,185

- How we good?

20
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:29,671
'Cause you make your money.

21
00:01:30,817 --> 00:01:31,753
Okay.

22
00:01:31,792 --> 00:01:33,729
- Cool? All right.
- Okay, but only this time.

23
00:01:33,754 --> 00:01:35,113
Okay, man. Cool, cool.

24
00:01:35,113 --> 00:01:36,802
You give me a hard time...

25
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:02,731
Hey, girl.

26
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:04,622
Hey, baby.

27
00:02:04,622 --> 00:02:06,162
I got something for you.

28
00:02:06,186 --> 00:02:07,975
Some of that jerky you like.

29
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:10,165
Hold on, I got you, I got you, I got you.

30
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,926
Here it is. Good girl.

31
00:02:15,238 --> 00:02:16,655
Like that, huh?

32
00:02:19,866 --> 00:02:21,418
What's going on in there?

33
00:02:22,111 --> 00:02:23,208
Hm...

34
00:02:27,822 --> 00:02:29,669
Messed up, not feeding you, huh?

35
00:02:32,671 --> 00:02:33,888
I know how it is.

36
00:02:48,471 --> 00:02:49,729
Oh, shit.

37
00:03:27,309 --> 00:03:28,602
Yo boy, you better take your ass home!

38
00:03:32,772 --> 00:03:34,095
Oh, shit.

39
00:04:11,144 --> 00:04:13,521
Man, oh, man, I didn't do nothing.

40
00:04:13,521 --> 00:04:15,253
- Shut the fuck up!
- Come on.

41
00:04:15,278 --> 00:04:16,483
I didn't do nothing.

42
00:04:16,483 --> 00:04:18,652
These cuffs too damn tight, man. Goddamn.

Yo, check this out, B.

00:04:57,923 --> 00:04:59,234
Oh, shit. A fish eating fish.

46
00:04:59,234 --> 00:05:00,819
Fucked up shit, man.

47
00:05:00,819 --> 00:05:02,404
And now you gotta clean it, fry it,

48
00:05:02,404 --> 00:05:03,875
serve it to some hipster.

49
00:05:04,614 --> 00:05:06,165
Circle of motherfucking life, dude.

50
00:05:06,298 --> 00:05:07,632
Come on, let's go. It's brunch time.

51
00:05:07,632 --> 00:05:08,778
What the hell are you doing?

52
00:05:08,849 --> 00:05:10,870
Oh, he just found a baby
shark in one of these squid.

53
00:05:10,929 --> 00:05:12,314
Is shark on the menu?

54
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:13,479
No, chef.

55
00:05:13,504 --> 00:05:15,097
- So don't mess with it.
- Yes, chef.

56
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,887
Hey.

57
00:05:17,431 --> 00:05:19,247
- How many covers we got today?
- 90.

58
00:05:19,517 --> 00:05:21,227
- Shit, okay.
- And the greens are in.

59
00:05:21,227 --> 00:05:22,355
What card do you wanna put it on?

60
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:23,567
This.

61
00:05:23,567 --> 00:05:25,196
Still haven't paid the wine guy, either.

62
00:05:25,221 --> 00:05:26,352
Shit.

63
00:05:26,423 --> 00:05:27,716
Don't worry. I'll talk to him.

64
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:29,109
Okay? Be nice.

65
00:05:29,109 --> 00:05:30,111
Got this.

66
00:05:31,069 --> 00:05:33,183
Hey, if you're good, you
two book through those in 20.

67
00:05:33,363 --> 00:05:34,886
Oh, we only need ten, chef.

68
00:05:34,972 --> 00:05:37,075
Bullshit. Just get it done
right. Come on, let's go!

69
00:05:37,075 --> 00:05:38,152
All right.

70
00:05:39,133 --> 00:05:40,946
You ask him about getting a shot in line?

71
00:05:41,496 --> 00:05:42,492
No, not yet.

72
00:05:42,517 --> 00:05:43,641
Why not?

73
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:45,023
Because Luis been here, like, three years.

74
00:05:45,047 --> 00:05:46,144
He should get it, right?

75
00:05:46,169 --> 00:05:47,461
I mean, you're twice as good as he is.

76
00:05:47,823 --> 00:05:49,325
There's gonna be a spot opening up.

77
00:05:49,756 --> 00:05:51,434
Tahir's leaving us for
the Girl and the Goat.

78
00:05:52,346 --> 00:05:53,414
For real?

79
00:05:53,726 --> 00:05:54,813
You all right?

80
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:56,148
- I'm all right. Thank you.
- Yeah.

81
00:05:56,148 --> 00:05:57,326
Thank you so much.

82
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:00,402
Yeah. Chef's wife want to throw you

83
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:01,904
some of that pussy.

84
00:06:01,904 --> 00:06:03,364
Or maybe you already hit that shit.

85
00:06:03,364 --> 00:06:04,861
Oh, go. No.

86
00:06:05,566 --> 00:06:07,359
No, man, she's just helping me out, G.

87
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,677
Helping you with what?

88
00:06:08,677 --> 00:06:10,411
Giving me a shot on the line, you know?

89
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:12,181
What you want to be on the line for?

90
00:06:12,562 --> 00:06:14,184
'Cause I got plans, dog.

91
00:06:14,398 --> 00:06:15,774
If I do my thing here,

92
00:06:15,774 --> 00:06:18,137
then me and my girl Jerrika
can open up our own restaurant,

93
00:06:18,137 --> 00:06:19,806
and then I don't got to be in here,

94
00:06:19,842 --> 00:06:21,177
prepping with your ass anymore.

95
00:06:21,202 --> 00:06:23,017
Whatever, man.

96
00:06:27,561 --> 00:06:29,312
Kiesha, let me borrow your phone.

97
00:06:29,337 --> 00:06:30,803
Uh-uh. No.

98
00:06:30,828 --> 00:06:31,912
All right, then.

99
00:06:31,956 --> 00:06:33,324
I'll tell Mom you're ditching.

100
00:06:34,784 --> 00:06:35,922
If she asks.

101
00:06:36,707 --> 00:06:38,245
Boy, you ain't gonna snitch.

102
00:06:38,459 --> 00:06:39,940
And who you gotta text?

103
00:06:40,086 --> 00:06:41,564
This girl.

104
00:06:42,465 --> 00:06:45,049
Oh, you a player now, huh?

105
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:47,226
Here.

106
00:06:48,261 --> 00:06:49,238
Thanks.

107
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:54,425
Uh-uh-uh!

108
00:06:54,786 --> 00:06:56,083
Dang.

109
00:07:02,024 --> 00:07:03,401
Hold on, hold on, hold on. Wait.

110
00:07:03,401 --> 00:07:05,498
What the hell is you doing, bro?

111
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:07,405
Nah, bro, whatchu doing? Not in public!

112
00:07:07,475 --> 00:07:08,842
Okay, look, I can't have

113
00:07:08,867 --> 00:07:10,157
my little brother looking all dirty,

114
00:07:10,157 --> 00:07:12,230
especially if you're trying
to holler at some girls.

115
00:07:12,868 --> 00:07:14,277
Come here.

116
00:07:16,457 --> 00:07:17,793
All right, Kiesha.

117
00:07:27,657 --> 00:07:30,094
Walk your punk ass over
there and talk to Andrea.

118
00:07:30,136 --> 00:07:32,188
Man, shut your fat ass up, Papa.

119
00:07:32,188 --> 00:07:33,973
Hey, I'm husky, not fat...

120
00:07:33,973 --> 00:07:35,224
Again about this husky shit.

121
00:07:35,224 --> 00:07:36,809
And I don't know why you tripping.

122
00:07:36,847 --> 00:07:38,307
Talking to girls ain't nothing.

123
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:39,645
All right, then. Since you're such

124
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:41,575
a fucking expert, you can come with me.

125
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,226
You with me or not?

126
00:07:43,266 --> 00:07:44,726
Man, why don't Jake go with you?

127
00:07:44,751 --> 00:07:46,057
Hell, no. Stop getting me into this.

128
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,502
Papa, just come on.

129
00:07:47,907 --> 00:07:49,276
A'ight. Bet.

130
00:07:50,128 --> 00:07:52,042
You know what? I think we should head back.

131
00:07:52,129 --> 00:07:53,110
No, no, no.

132
00:07:53,135 --> 00:07:54,369
Don't... wait...

133
00:07:54,425 --> 00:07:55,486
Come on, man.

134
00:07:56,814 --> 00:07:57,928
Hey, Andrea.

135
00:07:58,194 --> 00:07:59,221
Hey, Kevin.

136
00:07:59,221 --> 00:08:00,309
Rhonesha.

137
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:02,103
Yeah, Papa, I see you.

138
00:08:02,103 --> 00:08:03,605
Well, now, what you
laughing about, Rhonesha?

139
00:08:03,605 --> 00:08:05,465
- Nothing.
- Mm-hm.

140
00:08:06,267 --> 00:08:07,912
- Gonna sign up?
- Sign up for what?

141
00:08:08,267 --> 00:08:10,291
The play. You said you was gonna do it.

142
00:08:10,316 --> 00:08:11,855
Uh... I did?

143
00:08:12,152 --> 00:08:13,897
Yeah, you did.

144
00:08:14,658 --> 00:08:16,192
Jake, Papa, you know, you
guys should just sign up, too.

145
00:08:16,206 --> 00:08:17,377
No, no. We said

146
00:08:17,402 --> 00:08:18,504
"we're gonna check it out."

147
00:08:18,535 --> 00:08:19,661
Man, "we"?

148
00:08:20,048 --> 00:08:21,363
We gotta see how it is first.

149
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:22,715
Oh, shit, "The Wiz"?

150
00:08:22,762 --> 00:08:24,223
Hell, no, you're on your own.

151
00:08:24,371 --> 00:08:26,720
Hey, man, I don't fuck with plays, either.

152
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:29,818
Look, I just want to talk to you.

153
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:31,720
Okay, well, there'll be
plenty of time to talk

154
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,637
at the auditions.

155
00:08:33,073 --> 00:08:35,200
Come on, stop with the play...

156
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,987
Come on, man. Why you trying to sing, man?

157
00:08:45,535 --> 00:08:46,982
I'll see you later, Kevin.

158
00:08:47,683 --> 00:08:48,773
Come on.

159
00:08:53,856 --> 00:08:55,323
Man, you know you messed up.

160
00:08:56,061 --> 00:08:58,147
You better erase that shit, bro.

161
00:08:59,693 --> 00:09:01,197
- No.
- I don't know

162
00:09:01,197 --> 00:09:02,940
you Denzel wannabe motherfuckers.

163
00:09:03,795 --> 00:09:05,827
You got a test or something?

164
00:09:18,256 --> 00:09:19,674
Oh, no, what you doing? Fuck.

165
00:09:19,674 --> 00:09:21,348
Come over here and give me mine.

166
00:09:22,459 --> 00:09:24,387
But you know I gotta keep
my eyes out for my mom.

167
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:26,319
Oh, I ain't finishing by the window.

168
00:09:26,368 --> 00:09:28,202
You wanna get done, come over here.

169
00:09:29,308 --> 00:09:30,810
Shit.

170
00:09:37,191 --> 00:09:38,638
- Oh, wait.
- What?

171
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:40,194
Did you get those Currys
for my little brother?

172
00:09:40,878 --> 00:09:42,465
- The Currys?
- Yes.

173
00:09:42,613 --> 00:09:43,741
Your little brother want the Currys?

174
00:09:43,766 --> 00:09:44,789
Yeah.

175
00:09:45,324 --> 00:09:46,566
All right, all right.

176
00:09:55,566 --> 00:09:56,669
Who that?

177
00:09:57,009 --> 00:09:59,823
Uh, that's just, uh, my boy E-Ron.

178
00:09:59,887 --> 00:10:01,505
Why you ain't pick up, then?

179
00:10:01,847 --> 00:10:03,557
How will I answer some nigga's call

180
00:10:03,557 --> 00:10:04,867
- while I'm fucking you?
- Emmett.

181
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:06,646
Come on, Kiesha.

182
00:10:16,888 --> 00:10:18,225
Oh, shit.

183
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:20,750
Really?

184
00:10:21,486 --> 00:10:22,793
Hold on, hold on.

185
00:10:22,904 --> 00:10:23,935
Emmett.

186
00:10:29,368 --> 00:10:31,237
Oh, shit. Uh, it's sh...

187
00:10:31,262 --> 00:10:32,404
Oh, Tiffany.

188
00:10:32,429 --> 00:10:34,731
- Nah, it's... no, no!
- No, really, nigga? Tiffany?

189
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:36,229
Get off my fucking
phone! Get under the bed.

190
00:10:36,432 --> 00:10:37,784
I ain't getting under the bed.

191
00:10:37,809 --> 00:10:39,889
<i>What'd I tell you about
closing doors in my house?</i>

192
00:10:40,305 --> 00:10:41,485
Shit.

193
00:10:44,765 --> 00:10:45,819
Shit.

194
00:10:45,844 --> 00:10:46,898
Oh, fuck.

195
00:10:49,469 --> 00:10:50,546
<i>Emmett.</i>

196
00:10:50,601 --> 00:10:51,769
What'd I say?

197
00:10:51,769 --> 00:10:52,902
Uh, what?

198
00:10:53,998 --> 00:10:55,518
Uh, you said not to do it.

199
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:56,767
If all you're gonna do

200
00:10:56,792 --> 00:10:58,755
is fuck and get high up in here,

201
00:10:58,997 --> 00:11:01,041
the least you can do is start
paying your mother some rent.

202
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:02,787
I told you, I'm working this Friday.

203
00:11:03,017 --> 00:11:04,446
Why you always on me?

204
00:11:05,249 --> 00:11:06,709
Did you ask for more hours?

205
00:11:07,206 --> 00:11:08,290
Yes.

206
00:11:14,051 --> 00:11:15,201
What's your name, girl?

207
00:11:15,514 --> 00:11:16,718
Who you talking to?

208
00:11:16,781 --> 00:11:18,362
What's your name, girl?

209
00:11:20,106 --> 00:11:21,107
Kiesha.

210
00:11:21,504 --> 00:11:22,590
Kiesha.

211
00:11:23,733 --> 00:11:25,121
You hungry, Kiesha?

212
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:28,910
You want to stay for breakfast, Kiesha?

213
00:11:29,037 --> 00:11:30,156
No.

214
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:31,645
You like bacon, Kiesha?

215
00:11:32,638 --> 00:11:33,631
Yeah.

216
00:11:33,656 --> 00:11:34,561
Shut up.

217
00:11:34,586 --> 00:11:36,268
Too bad, 'cause the sausage was on sale,

218
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:38,124
so that's what we're having.

219
00:11:45,963 --> 00:11:47,767
Help the young lady up.

220
00:11:58,481 --> 00:12:02,151
<i>♪ I ain't gonna shoot</i>

221
00:12:14,164 --> 00:12:15,316
What's up, fellas.

222
00:12:15,432 --> 00:12:17,251
- Hey!
- There you go.

223
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:18,908
- There you go.
- Breakfast of champions?

224
00:12:18,933 --> 00:12:20,838
- That's it, boy.
- My man.

225
00:12:20,909 --> 00:12:22,630
Let me see. What it is, what it is.

226
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,727
No, man, I'm on the juice.

227
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:28,705
Purify the body, sharpen the mind.

228
00:12:29,952 --> 00:12:31,787
Ronnie going Nation on us and shit.

229
00:12:31,787 --> 00:12:34,129
Nah, it ain't that.
Just getting in shape, yo.

230
00:12:35,645 --> 00:12:37,105
In shape for what, man?

231
00:12:37,136 --> 00:12:38,722
So I can fight the power.

232
00:12:39,102 --> 00:12:40,437
Nigga, read the label.

233
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,849
That's just all sugar.

234
00:12:41,874 --> 00:12:42,999
It's, like, 10% juice.

235
00:12:43,165 --> 00:12:45,334
No, it says 12% juice.

236
00:12:45,397 --> 00:12:47,736
Shit. Gotta start somewhere.

237
00:12:47,761 --> 00:12:49,062
The fuck you talking about, man?

238
00:12:49,087 --> 00:12:51,089
Getting on the program so I don't end up

239
00:12:51,114 --> 00:12:52,438
like Chivas Fred over there.

240
00:12:52,742 --> 00:12:55,091
Hey... Program?

241
00:12:56,455 --> 00:12:58,137
You ain't got a job.

242
00:12:58,137 --> 00:12:59,638
The fuck I need a job for?

243
00:12:59,638 --> 00:13:01,569
So I can pay Trump taxes?

244
00:13:02,107 --> 00:13:03,642
Fuck that shit.

245
00:13:04,398 --> 00:13:06,395
"Make America great again."

246
00:13:06,395 --> 00:13:08,105
Nah, nigga, so you make me great again.

247
00:13:08,105 --> 00:13:09,314
Loan me some money, dig it?

248
00:13:09,314 --> 00:13:10,482
Where you going, little momma?

249
00:13:10,482 --> 00:13:11,815
Got a man?

250
00:13:12,151 --> 00:13:14,028
I know you like that Teddy Pendergrass.

251
00:13:14,028 --> 00:13:15,654
- Strike one.
- What about R. Kelly?

252
00:13:15,654 --> 00:13:16,840
Strike two.

253
00:13:16,902 --> 00:13:18,810
- Your body's calling.
- Swing and a miss!

254
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:20,568
Let's go half on the baby!

255
00:13:20,593 --> 00:13:22,580
Shit.

256
00:13:22,584 --> 00:13:24,545
My girl looks better than her, anyway.

257
00:13:24,545 --> 00:13:27,035
Tracy ain't your girl no more, though.

258
00:13:28,298 --> 00:13:30,325
She gave me my son,
so she'll always be mine.

259
00:13:30,381 --> 00:13:31,716
Jason ain't even yours, man.

260
00:13:31,716 --> 00:13:33,557
I raised him like he was.

261
00:13:33,843 --> 00:13:35,595
No matter how hard you try,

262
00:13:35,595 --> 00:13:36,896
she ain't ever coming back no more, bro.

263
00:13:36,896 --> 00:13:38,064
She ain't coming back, brother.

264
00:13:38,065 --> 00:13:40,252
- Not coming back.
- Fuck both y'all. Shit.

265
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:41,351
One time.

266
00:13:44,905 --> 00:13:46,221
The fuck you doing here?

267
00:13:46,446 --> 00:13:48,160
- How's it going, officer?
- Uh-oh.

268
00:13:48,185 --> 00:13:49,338
We need to talk, Ronnie.

269
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,344
Is somebody calling you?

270
00:13:50,382 --> 00:13:51,992
Hey, hey, hey, man! Hey, hey.

271
00:13:52,054 --> 00:13:54,484
I told you, I ain't got no
shit to say to you no more.

272
00:13:54,953 --> 00:13:56,156
Tight-ass boots.

273
00:13:56,187 --> 00:13:57,127
Tight-ass pants, boy.

274
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:59,254
Get in the car. It's about Jason.

275
00:13:59,254 --> 00:14:00,782
Mama still dressing that ass, nigga?

276
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,125
You're fat, ugly
as shit, man, for real.

277
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:07,721
Hey, Ronnie, we got you, though. I got you.

278
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:11,126
Damn...

279
00:14:15,675 --> 00:14:17,697
Goddamn.

280
00:14:19,051 --> 00:14:20,430
Jason?

281
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:23,417
Fuck.

282
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:26,327
Where?

283
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:28,294
79th.

284
00:14:29,576 --> 00:14:31,123
Shot twice.

285
00:14:32,336 --> 00:14:34,414
The fuck he doing up there?

286
00:14:34,951 --> 00:14:36,265
Shit...

287
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:38,038
Was he into something?

288
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:40,754
No, he was a good kid.

289
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:42,251
Made all-city last year.

290
00:14:44,894 --> 00:14:46,545
You in his life, then?

291
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,158
Try to be, you know.

292
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,711
Can I see him?

293
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:50,246
Jason...

294
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:53,139
Jason, baby... Jason...

295
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:56,165
Ronnie, my baby...

296
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:58,562
My baby...

297
00:16:00,263 --> 00:16:02,667
Oh, God, Jason...

298
00:16:04,092 --> 00:16:06,239
I want to know who did this to my boy!

299
00:16:06,326 --> 00:16:08,302
You tell me who did this!

300
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,390
They took my baby.

301
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:13,430
We picked up somebody.

302
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:14,702
He was standing over the body.

303
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,475
- Who?
- Kid from the neighborhood.

304
00:16:17,796 --> 00:16:18,846
That's...

305
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:20,270
That's all I can say.

306
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,551
Oh, God...

307
00:16:21,971 --> 00:16:23,020
Ronnie...

308
00:16:23,139 --> 00:16:24,567
Take all the time you need.

309
00:16:25,101 --> 00:16:26,394
Oh...

310
00:16:28,478 --> 00:16:29,914
They took my baby...

311
00:16:32,596 --> 00:16:33,681
Jason...

312
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:35,892
My baby...

313
00:16:37,737 --> 00:16:40,646
My baby... Oh, God...

314
00:16:45,085 --> 00:16:46,018
Ronnie...

315
00:16:46,323 --> 00:16:47,752
Oh, God...

316
00:16:48,634 --> 00:16:49,832
Can I phone a lawyer?

317
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:54,724
Help me!

318
00:16:54,974 --> 00:16:56,855
This some police brutality shit here!

319
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,030
Boy, don't even try to
pull that shit with me.

320
00:16:59,509 --> 00:17:00,510
Yes, ma'am.

321
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:01,642
Good.

322
00:17:17,068 --> 00:17:18,630
What's wrong, baby?

323
00:17:18,671 --> 00:17:21,322
- Why you pulling away?
- Oh, you stinky!

324
00:17:22,112 --> 00:17:23,825
Get off of me. You stink.

325
00:17:23,825 --> 00:17:25,076
It's just a little squid juice.

326
00:17:25,076 --> 00:17:26,820
You gotta deal with your mother.

327
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,322
What'd she do?

328
00:17:28,997 --> 00:17:30,231
Well...

329
00:17:30,915 --> 00:17:32,625
She just popped up,

330
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:33,751
talking about she don't have your number.

331
00:17:33,781 --> 00:17:35,074
How is that even possible?

332
00:17:35,099 --> 00:17:36,108
I don't know,

333
00:17:36,465 --> 00:17:37,880
but she's drunk.

334
00:17:38,923 --> 00:17:40,952
Definitely possible.

335
00:17:41,926 --> 00:17:43,194
It's not funny.

336
00:17:43,631 --> 00:17:44,924
She probably just wants
some money or something, J.

337
00:17:44,924 --> 00:17:46,885
I'll deal with that shit later.

338
00:17:50,266 --> 00:17:51,598
Hey, don't let it get to you.

339
00:17:51,598 --> 00:17:53,141
You wanna hear some good news?

340
00:17:54,048 --> 00:17:55,271
What?

341
00:17:56,406 --> 00:17:57,945
I get a shot at the line.

342
00:17:58,353 --> 00:17:59,681
No.

343
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,205
What? You!

344
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:04,164
Yeah, they gave me a shot,

345
00:18:04,164 --> 00:18:05,605
and if I rock it, I get the job, so...

346
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:07,415
Well, then you better rock it, then.

347
00:18:07,415 --> 00:18:08,917
- Oh, I'm gonna rock it.
- You're gonna rock it?

348
00:18:08,917 --> 00:18:10,099
I'm gonna rock it.

349
00:18:12,643 --> 00:18:14,026
You're so ugly.

350
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:16,267
You're so rude.

351
00:18:20,276 --> 00:18:21,944
You still washing dishes,

352
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:23,314
or they let you sweep the floors now?

353
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:24,863
I had a great day.

354
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:26,983
Thanks for asking. How was your day?

355
00:18:27,901 --> 00:18:29,251
Coogie in jail.

356
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,276
I need you to give me a ride
down to the police station.

357
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:32,277
Wait, what happened?

358
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:34,088
Listen here, girl, don't
be getting your nose

359
00:18:34,089 --> 00:18:35,883
all up in my fucking business,
all right? It's bad enough

360
00:18:35,883 --> 00:18:37,426
I gotta come all the way
up here to see my son.

361
00:18:37,426 --> 00:18:38,385
Why do you have to talk to her like that?

362
00:18:38,385 --> 00:18:40,095
- Why is this a thing?
- I talk to her

363
00:18:40,095 --> 00:18:41,682
any goddamn way I please!

364
00:18:41,707 --> 00:18:43,369
Now you gonna take me
down to the police station

365
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:45,079
or I'ma have to catch a bus.

366
00:18:45,104 --> 00:18:46,647
See, this some bullshit right here.

367
00:18:46,647 --> 00:18:48,023
Look, I'll give you my car, and I'll just

368
00:18:48,023 --> 00:18:49,376
take the train to work.

369
00:18:49,376 --> 00:18:51,295
What kind of man ain't
got his own damn car?

370
00:18:51,776 --> 00:18:53,236
You stop buying dumb shit

371
00:18:53,267 --> 00:18:54,626
like flowers and throw pillows...

372
00:18:54,674 --> 00:18:56,928
Does it even really matter whose car it is?

373
00:18:57,951 --> 00:18:59,496
You need a ride, don't you?

374
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:01,310
Goddamn.

375
00:19:01,829 --> 00:19:03,649
You can buy plastic flowers, you know.

376
00:19:05,547 --> 00:19:07,029
Save money that way.

377
00:19:12,298 --> 00:19:13,347
How you doing?

378
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,968
I'm good.

379
00:19:15,592 --> 00:19:17,250
Detective Armando Cruz.

380
00:19:17,804 --> 00:19:19,017
Coogie.

381
00:19:23,184 --> 00:19:24,711
You know who runs that corner?

382
00:19:25,186 --> 00:19:27,028
I know a lot of things, Detective.

383
00:19:27,689 --> 00:19:29,357
And I know you ain't
got shit to hold on me,

384
00:19:29,357 --> 00:19:31,514
but, you know, that's
what y'all policemen do.

385
00:19:31,693 --> 00:19:34,153
Y'all just make shit up
just 'cause y'all the police.

386
00:19:34,153 --> 00:19:36,556
Oh, wow, okay. That's good to know.

387
00:19:38,206 --> 00:19:40,927
Man, what do you have on? What are those?

388
00:19:41,311 --> 00:19:42,327
What?

389
00:19:42,356 --> 00:19:44,131
Your shoes. You get 'em at Kmart?

390
00:19:44,163 --> 00:19:46,372
No, at the mall, and they're Clarks.

391
00:19:46,397 --> 00:19:48,146
No, man, those are, like,

392
00:19:48,195 --> 00:19:49,852
some ugly-ass church shoes.

393
00:19:49,852 --> 00:19:51,383
What were you doing around that body?

394
00:19:53,397 --> 00:19:55,908
Yeah, you know you should
get some Timbs, Detective.

395
00:19:56,567 --> 00:19:57,946
Yeah, Timberlands.

396
00:19:58,152 --> 00:19:59,678
Think those would look real good on you.

397
00:19:59,678 --> 00:20:01,435
What were you doing on that corner?

398
00:20:04,104 --> 00:20:06,273
Maybe you were following him
there, you tried to rob him?

399
00:20:07,087 --> 00:20:08,990
Shoes are missing, you know. Cell phone.

400
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:10,867
Necklace.

401
00:20:11,283 --> 00:20:13,017
You had his blood on your hands.

402
00:20:13,452 --> 00:20:14,954
Testing to see if he was still alive.

403
00:20:14,979 --> 00:20:16,121
Maybe you grabbed his phone.

404
00:20:16,121 --> 00:20:17,296
What would I want with a phone?

405
00:20:17,784 --> 00:20:19,625
You know those shits give
you brain cancer, right?

406
00:20:22,127 --> 00:20:23,149
Do...

407
00:20:24,088 --> 00:20:25,376
Do you think this is a...

408
00:20:25,464 --> 00:20:26,939
A game we're playing here?

409
00:20:28,384 --> 00:20:29,539
No, man.

410
00:20:32,096 --> 00:20:34,140
You do know who runs that corner.

411
00:20:35,391 --> 00:20:36,452
Yeah.

412
00:20:36,495 --> 00:20:38,300
If you know who runs the corner,

413
00:20:38,477 --> 00:20:40,065
what are you doing up there?

414
00:20:41,435 --> 00:20:42,856
I...

415
00:20:45,984 --> 00:20:47,456
I was, uh,

416
00:20:48,014 --> 00:20:49,739
visiting this dog.

417
00:20:50,399 --> 00:20:51,737
You know? Um...

418
00:20:52,224 --> 00:20:53,475
I feed her.

419
00:20:53,847 --> 00:20:55,291
We talk, you know?

420
00:20:59,603 --> 00:21:01,814
So that's... that's what I
was doing up there, Detective.

421
00:21:01,814 --> 00:21:03,777
I mean, I wasn't doing nothing else.

422
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:05,396
Dog?

423
00:21:06,235 --> 00:21:08,260
Yeah, man. I-I take care of her.

424
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:22,362
What now?

425
00:21:25,838 --> 00:21:26,910
Cruz-er.

426
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:29,335
He give you anything?

427
00:21:31,301 --> 00:21:32,379
Huh?

428
00:21:33,671 --> 00:21:34,863
He has no gun.

429
00:21:34,988 --> 00:21:37,915
No priors, except for
some bullshit shoplifting.

430
00:21:38,035 --> 00:21:39,844
Body was in front of a stash house.

431
00:21:40,035 --> 00:21:41,161
This touches your thing?

432
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:42,145
You tell me.

433
00:21:42,199 --> 00:21:43,469
What's this kid doing by that house?

434
00:21:43,516 --> 00:21:45,212
He said he came by to feed a dog.

435
00:21:45,488 --> 00:21:46,947
Feed a dog? Why would he do that?

436
00:21:47,216 --> 00:21:48,449
'Cause he likes dogs.

437
00:21:48,449 --> 00:21:49,617
Okay.

438
00:21:49,617 --> 00:21:50,923
So you're gonna kick him?

439
00:21:51,535 --> 00:21:53,600
You know, I got nothing to hold him.

440
00:21:54,998 --> 00:21:56,777
Did he see anything when he was,

441
00:21:56,777 --> 00:21:58,165
you know, feeding this dog?

442
00:21:58,839 --> 00:22:00,096
Like what?

443
00:22:00,096 --> 00:22:01,598
All kinds of shit he could see.

444
00:22:01,818 --> 00:22:02,902
He was, uh...

445
00:22:03,888 --> 00:22:05,409
he's a smart kid.

446
00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:08,196
He ain't gonna say shit,

447
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:09,991
even if he did.

448
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:11,505
Yeah.

449
00:22:11,505 --> 00:22:12,631
- You know?
- That's right.

450
00:22:13,468 --> 00:22:14,925
You been working out?

451
00:22:15,342 --> 00:22:16,261
No.

452
00:22:16,604 --> 00:22:17,669
I didn't think so.

453
00:22:34,455 --> 00:22:36,499
Hey, girl... Hey!

454
00:22:40,121 --> 00:22:41,429
I know I fucked up.

455
00:22:41,468 --> 00:22:42,713
You need to ask her out.

456
00:22:42,956 --> 00:22:44,397
Do it now, then.

457
00:22:45,758 --> 00:22:47,426
No, she with friends and shit.

458
00:22:47,496 --> 00:22:49,127
It ain't like you gonna catch her alone.

459
00:22:49,191 --> 00:22:51,187
You know these pretty bitches run in packs.

460
00:22:51,242 --> 00:22:54,078
Yeah, but they need to kick
Rhonesha's ass out the group.

461
00:22:54,266 --> 00:22:55,559
Sitting over there looking like

462
00:22:55,614 --> 00:22:57,651
a motherfucking sea donkey on steroids.

463
00:22:57,772 --> 00:22:59,404
Oh, shit, here they come.

464
00:23:01,209 --> 00:23:02,193
Can I help you?

465
00:23:02,357 --> 00:23:03,459
No.

466
00:23:04,222 --> 00:23:05,815
Here's a script for you.

467
00:23:06,278 --> 00:23:07,992
Got to find the role that
you're gonna audition for.

468
00:23:08,697 --> 00:23:09,907
Dude, you should ask her out.

469
00:23:10,959 --> 00:23:12,121
All right.

470
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,166
Man, you blew it again.

471
00:23:16,205 --> 00:23:17,695
You ain't never gonna ask her out.

472
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,936
You, shut up. I'm just picking my spot.

473
00:23:18,961 --> 00:23:20,584
Your ass taking long enough.

474
00:23:20,584 --> 00:23:22,920
Hey, I know Andrea your girl
and all, but to be honest,

475
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,838
I think she's actually
starting to feel me...

476
00:23:24,838 --> 00:23:25,964
Sit your fat ass down.

477
00:23:25,996 --> 00:23:27,623
Ain't nobody feeling you.

478
00:23:27,648 --> 00:23:29,149
Everybody's like a third wheel today.

479
00:23:29,174 --> 00:23:31,163
Back up, back up.

480
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:46,945
Ah!

481
00:23:47,628 --> 00:23:48,859
Ah!

482
00:23:54,702 --> 00:23:55,973
Really, nigga?

483
00:23:55,973 --> 00:23:57,057
I'm not doing this with you today.

484
00:23:57,057 --> 00:23:58,517
I really don't want to have to

485
00:23:58,517 --> 00:23:59,685
have my brothers come fuck you up.

486
00:23:59,967 --> 00:24:01,219
I don't.

487
00:24:01,468 --> 00:24:03,440
You need to start taking
care of your responsibilities.

488
00:24:03,521 --> 00:24:05,315
I do. Their names are Davante

489
00:24:05,315 --> 00:24:07,025
and Cassius, and I can't afford no more.

490
00:24:07,025 --> 00:24:07,984
Well, you're gonna have to start.

491
00:24:07,984 --> 00:24:09,452
Emmett Junior is your responsibility, too.

492
00:24:09,452 --> 00:24:10,453
Just 'cause you name him after me

493
00:24:10,454 --> 00:24:11,956
don't make him mine.

494
00:24:11,956 --> 00:24:13,332
Let me get these in a size nine.

495
00:24:13,332 --> 00:24:14,375
Fuck you, Emmett.

496
00:24:14,375 --> 00:24:15,376
Yeah, you did.

497
00:24:15,376 --> 00:24:17,412
You also fucked your way
through the south side of...

498
00:24:18,735 --> 00:24:19,965
You fucking lucky.

499
00:24:20,005 --> 00:24:21,638
You lucky you did that shit
to me, because a lesser dude

500
00:24:21,663 --> 00:24:23,414
would've punched you in your fucking mouth.

501
00:24:23,414 --> 00:24:24,916
Take it outside.

502
00:24:24,916 --> 00:24:26,394
I'm a paying customer.
I ain't going nowhere.

503
00:24:26,419 --> 00:24:28,028
You all want to make
some money in this bitch?

504
00:24:28,053 --> 00:24:29,367
Ma'am, if you're not gonna

505
00:24:29,392 --> 00:24:30,630
purchase anything, I'ma
have to ask you to leave.

506
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:31,814
She ain't got no fucking money.

507
00:24:31,844 --> 00:24:33,214
Well, I'd have some if
you'd pay child support.

508
00:24:33,239 --> 00:24:35,032
- He ain't my son!
- The fuck is you talking about?

509
00:24:35,032 --> 00:24:36,200
He looks just like you!

510
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,410
- He looks like the last nig...
- Fuck you, Emmett!

511
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:39,995
I got it, I got it. Grab the baby.

512
00:24:40,127 --> 00:24:41,941
We're gonna do the
paternity test right now,

513
00:24:42,018 --> 00:24:43,332
and you can get the fuck out of my face.

514
00:24:43,332 --> 00:24:44,959
Let's go. Come on, let's go.

515
00:24:52,735 --> 00:24:54,735
_

516
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:31,755
I'm so sorry, Tracy.

517
00:25:35,551 --> 00:25:37,094
I'm sorry.

518
00:25:49,329 --> 00:25:51,456
It's gonna be all right.

519
00:25:51,481 --> 00:25:53,237
You'll be okay.

520
00:26:03,415 --> 00:26:05,706
Thanks for seeing I had
shit to do with this.

521
00:26:05,706 --> 00:26:07,374
<i>I mean, if that's their call...</i>

522
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:13,797
You in school?

523
00:26:13,797 --> 00:26:15,466
You don't got to lecture me. All right?

524
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:17,326
I'm done fucking with dead bodies.

525
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:19,593
You gonna do something about
them shoes, though, right?

526
00:26:19,633 --> 00:26:20,875
Timberlands, right?

527
00:26:20,951 --> 00:26:23,531
Yeah, and not them
fake-ass Oriental bullshit

528
00:26:23,612 --> 00:26:25,030
they sell on Maxwell Street, all right?

529
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:26,444
The real ones.

530
00:26:26,887 --> 00:26:28,472
With pink socks, too, right?

531
00:26:28,472 --> 00:26:29,802
Man, that's the style.

532
00:26:30,015 --> 00:26:31,349
You need to keep up, old man.

533
00:26:36,521 --> 00:26:38,190
- Mama, I...
- Get your ass...

534
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:39,357
Mom, Mom!

535
00:26:39,357 --> 00:26:40,538
Hey, calm down!

536
00:26:40,563 --> 00:26:42,128
I want to know what
the fuck you been doing.

537
00:26:43,729 --> 00:26:45,315
I'm sorry about that. Thank you.

538
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:47,213
Uh...

539
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:48,373
You're his brother?

540
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:49,421
Yes, sir.

541
00:26:49,539 --> 00:26:50,985
You know, we... We found him

542
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:52,643
standing over a body on the nine.

543
00:26:53,084 --> 00:26:54,740
Well, he ain't got nothing to do with it.

544
00:26:55,255 --> 00:26:56,563
He's a good kid.

545
00:26:57,075 --> 00:26:58,423
Here's my card.

546
00:26:58,724 --> 00:27:00,279
You know, just in case...

547
00:27:09,063 --> 00:27:10,861
But that don't matter to the police!

548
00:27:10,928 --> 00:27:12,372
- Don't you know?
- Goddamn...

549
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:13,405
You don't talk to the police,

550
00:27:13,405 --> 00:27:14,975
'cause you can't trust 'em.

551
00:27:15,703 --> 00:27:16,724
Mom...

552
00:27:16,749 --> 00:27:17,759
Really?

553
00:27:18,146 --> 00:27:20,241
Maybe he should just come stay
with us for a little while.

554
00:27:20,281 --> 00:27:21,654
What for?

555
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:22,930
Just a couple nights. That's it.

556
00:27:22,955 --> 00:27:24,331
Just a couple nights.

557
00:27:24,616 --> 00:27:26,523
You know me and Jerrika got the space.

558
00:27:27,192 --> 00:27:29,027
Just let me spend some time with him.

559
00:27:29,027 --> 00:27:30,564
It'll be good for him to
get out of the neighborhood.

560
00:27:31,654 --> 00:27:33,023
You think you can do better than me?

561
00:27:33,058 --> 00:27:34,157
I'm not saying...

562
00:27:34,157 --> 00:27:35,200
Go on, boy.

563
00:27:35,251 --> 00:27:36,582
Mama...

564
00:27:36,582 --> 00:27:38,393
- Go already!
- You gotta do all that?

565
00:27:43,797 --> 00:27:45,164
<i>Open this door!</i>

566
00:27:45,189 --> 00:27:46,469
<i>Wake your ass up right now!</i>

567
00:27:46,494 --> 00:27:47,533
Huh?

568
00:27:49,342 --> 00:27:51,131
Oh, my God. I'm coming!

569
00:27:54,388 --> 00:27:55,666
What the fuck?

570
00:27:57,058 --> 00:27:58,517
She just handed him to me

571
00:27:58,542 --> 00:28:00,347
and said you were expecting him.

572
00:28:00,348 --> 00:28:01,871
This bitch is crazy.

573
00:28:01,896 --> 00:28:03,130
He ain't mine, Ma.

574
00:28:03,161 --> 00:28:04,607
And this was in his diaper bag.

575
00:28:06,692 --> 00:28:08,903
Says right there, you his father.

576
00:28:09,674 --> 00:28:10,674
Fuck!

577
00:28:10,713 --> 00:28:13,049
That's exactly what you
did, and keep on doing

578
00:28:13,074 --> 00:28:15,077
for some reason without a condom.

579
00:28:15,823 --> 00:28:18,154
Hey, hey, look. Hey, have it.

580
00:28:18,412 --> 00:28:19,747
Just watch him for, like, ten minutes.

581
00:28:19,747 --> 00:28:20,915
Where do you think you're going?

582
00:28:20,915 --> 00:28:22,149
I'ma try to find her!

583
00:28:22,196 --> 00:28:23,584
Well, you're taking him with you.

584
00:28:23,584 --> 00:28:24,752
I ain't got no car seat, Mom.

585
00:28:24,752 --> 00:28:26,157
Then I suggest you sell

586
00:28:26,182 --> 00:28:27,532
some of these sneakers and buy one.

587
00:28:27,557 --> 00:28:29,116
Emmett, that child is
your responsibility now.

588
00:28:29,141 --> 00:28:30,800
Mom, could you watch him
for just 30 minutes...

589
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,926
No, because I'm done raising

590
00:28:31,926 --> 00:28:33,061
nappy-headed little boys.

591
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:44,132
Where your mom at? Huh?

592
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:48,124
Oh, you like these, huh?

593
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,418
Maybe you is my son.

594
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,565
But you can't have these.

595
00:28:54,565 --> 00:28:55,649
Let me... let me see.

596
00:28:55,649 --> 00:28:56,765
You can't have these.

597
00:28:57,401 --> 00:28:58,743
These are my babies.

598
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,761
How about these?

599
00:29:02,823 --> 00:29:03,822
No?

600
00:29:14,274 --> 00:29:15,984
What... what... What is it?

601
00:29:16,009 --> 00:29:18,505
It is... PB&J.

602
00:29:20,549 --> 00:29:23,010
- It is?
- Yes. It's pork belly and apple jelly.

603
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:24,965
Just culture yourself. Trust me.

604
00:29:25,224 --> 00:29:27,143
That is really fucking good, babe.

605
00:29:27,143 --> 00:29:29,687
See, I told you. I used a
little Hawaiian sweet roll.

606
00:29:29,687 --> 00:29:31,439
They make it in a loaf now.

607
00:29:37,695 --> 00:29:40,906
- It's good, ain't it?
- All right. Yeah, yeah.

608
00:29:40,906 --> 00:29:42,159
It's good, I give you that,

609
00:29:42,261 --> 00:29:45,244
but this ain't no fucking PB&J, man.

610
00:29:45,244 --> 00:29:46,954
- All right.
- What?

611
00:29:46,954 --> 00:29:48,205
But it's good, though. It's good.

612
00:29:48,205 --> 00:29:50,252
It's gonna be on the menu
when I open up my spot, so...

613
00:29:50,332 --> 00:29:51,488
Oh, your spot?

614
00:29:52,168 --> 00:29:53,169
- I'm sorry.
- You mean our spot?

615
00:29:53,169 --> 00:29:54,128
Our spot.

616
00:29:54,128 --> 00:29:55,229
Yeah.

617
00:29:55,268 --> 00:29:57,673
Yeah. Me and Jerrika
are opening up a restaurant, so...

618
00:29:57,863 --> 00:29:59,823
You gotta have tall stacks to do that, bro.

619
00:30:00,011 --> 00:30:02,222
Your brother got promoted to the line

620
00:30:02,222 --> 00:30:03,448
at the restaurant.

621
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,597
Okay.

622
00:30:04,597 --> 00:30:05,890
I don't got the job yet, but...

623
00:30:06,107 --> 00:30:07,256
You're gonna get it.

624
00:30:07,665 --> 00:30:08,852
Oh, thank you.

625
00:30:08,852 --> 00:30:10,318
- Mm-hm.
- Mm-hm?

626
00:30:10,343 --> 00:30:12,647
All right. Um, I gotta go get my bike

627
00:30:12,678 --> 00:30:14,210
before someone boosts it, so...

628
00:30:14,367 --> 00:30:15,719
Well, actually, I have some

629
00:30:16,025 --> 00:30:17,827
errands and stuff to run before work if...

630
00:30:17,901 --> 00:30:19,072
You don't mind, do you?

631
00:30:19,097 --> 00:30:21,697
Oh, so y'all just gonna
leave me with the cleanup?

632
00:30:21,744 --> 00:30:23,657
Uh, you know. I'm sure
I can make it up to you.

633
00:30:23,657 --> 00:30:24,937
Oh, yeah, how?

634
00:30:24,937 --> 00:30:26,147
I'm sure I'll think of something.

635
00:30:26,148 --> 00:30:27,190
All right, I'll see you!

636
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:28,141
Okay.

637
00:30:28,166 --> 00:30:29,548
- Come on, man.
- Yes.

638
00:30:33,488 --> 00:30:35,182
All right. That's my only key,

639
00:30:35,282 --> 00:30:36,683
so do not lose my shit.

640
00:30:36,783 --> 00:30:38,082
Jerrika will kill us both,

641
00:30:38,304 --> 00:30:39,848
- and, um...
- I got you.

642
00:30:40,028 --> 00:30:41,111
Text her when you're on the way.

643
00:30:41,136 --> 00:30:42,391
You know what I mean? Let her know.

644
00:30:42,603 --> 00:30:43,629
- All right?
- Cool, cool.

645
00:30:44,328 --> 00:30:45,527
You need anything?

646
00:30:45,656 --> 00:30:46,840
Nah, man, I'm good.

647
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,762
Well, shit. Maybe tomorrow,
I'll take you downtown.

648
00:30:48,787 --> 00:30:50,543
Get you fresh, get you out of them

649
00:30:50,568 --> 00:30:52,401
bright-ass diving boards you got there.

650
00:30:52,426 --> 00:30:54,181
Bro, what you mean? Man.

651
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,179
Try to sleep, all right?

652
00:32:07,633 --> 00:32:09,078
I don't want to sleep.

653
00:32:09,952 --> 00:32:11,007
Mm-mm.

654
00:32:21,141 --> 00:32:23,118
Just doesn't make sense.

655
00:32:29,742 --> 00:32:31,609
Where was he coming from?

656
00:32:33,746 --> 00:32:36,069
He texted me and said he was at a party.

657
00:32:37,101 --> 00:32:39,010
What, did someone fuck with him there?

658
00:32:39,585 --> 00:32:40,753
He would've told me.

659
00:32:41,832 --> 00:32:43,242
I don't know. I mean...

660
00:32:43,923 --> 00:32:46,390
He had his own way sometimes. You sure?

661
00:32:47,135 --> 00:32:48,525
I know my son.

662
00:32:51,435 --> 00:32:53,798
And I loved him like he was mine, too.

663
00:32:58,785 --> 00:33:00,606
Taught him how to pee straight.

664
00:33:01,244 --> 00:33:03,780
And that crossover

665
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:05,407
he used to put up 20 points on Simeon...

666
00:33:05,407 --> 00:33:07,781
We worked on that shit
for weeks at the park.

667
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:11,496
He was mine, too.

668
00:33:11,496 --> 00:33:14,226
You say you his father,
then you need to act like it.

669
00:33:17,294 --> 00:33:19,458
You need to find out who shot Jason.

670
00:33:20,048 --> 00:33:21,508
I'll... I'll ask around.

671
00:33:21,533 --> 00:33:23,076
I ain't asking you to "ask around."

672
00:33:23,101 --> 00:33:24,411
Cops already said they had...

673
00:33:24,432 --> 00:33:26,820
Cops ain't gonna do shit,
Ronnie, and you know it!

674
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,187
You always took care of me, Ronnie.

675
00:33:45,975 --> 00:33:47,827
And I want to again.

676
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:03,967
Yo, Curtis.

677
00:34:11,594 --> 00:34:13,221
You ask around about Jason?

678
00:34:13,246 --> 00:34:14,425
Yeah.

679
00:34:14,933 --> 00:34:16,271
Reg said one of his lookouts

680
00:34:16,296 --> 00:34:17,619
might have saw something.

681
00:34:18,641 --> 00:34:20,358
Told him you might come
through and holler at him.

682
00:34:20,738 --> 00:34:22,200
Sh... where at? The corner?

683
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:23,516
Yeah.

684
00:34:36,872 --> 00:34:38,905
I never saw your boy Jason around before.

685
00:34:39,544 --> 00:34:41,338
Except he ended up dead
here in front of my house.

686
00:34:41,338 --> 00:34:43,006
And now the police is all up on us.

687
00:34:43,006 --> 00:34:45,190
Curtis said one of your boys saw something.

688
00:34:46,593 --> 00:34:48,136
Yeah, the kid the police took,

689
00:34:48,136 --> 00:34:49,137
who was standing over your boy.

690
00:34:49,137 --> 00:34:50,757
What? Where?

691
00:34:53,099 --> 00:34:54,184
Yo, Stick!

692
00:35:08,865 --> 00:35:10,256
Tell him what you saw.

693
00:35:12,397 --> 00:35:14,074
Same nigga the police got...

694
00:35:14,271 --> 00:35:16,150
Seen him fucking around
behind the house today.

695
00:35:16,361 --> 00:35:17,556
What he look like?

696
00:35:17,711 --> 00:35:19,793
Got a big fro, like a girl.

697
00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:23,080
I see him all the time at the store,

698
00:35:23,139 --> 00:35:24,627
fucking around on his
bike like a white boy.

699
00:35:24,666 --> 00:35:26,023
Get the fuck back to it.

700
00:35:27,103 --> 00:35:28,211
All right.

701
00:35:31,088 --> 00:35:32,395
Do what you gotta do.

702
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:35,420
Just don't fuck with our shit
more than it's already fucked with.

703
00:35:36,469 --> 00:35:37,738
You bet.

704
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,047
<i>Back, right. That's it.</i>

705
00:36:00,576 --> 00:36:01,789
<i>Stay together now.</i>

706
00:36:13,445 --> 00:36:14,949
You here for auditions?

707
00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:18,663
Name?

708
00:36:18,761 --> 00:36:19,902
Kevin Williams.

709
00:36:19,902 --> 00:36:21,222
Hey, Mr. Williams.

710
00:36:21,222 --> 00:36:22,360
You're late.

711
00:36:22,431 --> 00:36:23,593
What role?

712
00:36:24,076 --> 00:36:25,313
- Uh...
- Tin Man.

713
00:36:28,283 --> 00:36:29,415
Tin Man? Is you cr...

714
00:36:29,415 --> 00:36:30,916
I can't do Tin Man.

715
00:36:31,184 --> 00:36:32,669
How do you know unless you try?

716
00:36:35,236 --> 00:36:36,824
So I was thinking, maybe...

717
00:36:36,849 --> 00:36:37,919
What?

718
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:41,771
We could go to the mall sometime?

719
00:36:42,225 --> 00:36:43,311
When?

720
00:36:43,554 --> 00:36:44,847
Maybe this weekend?

721
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:48,171
Saturday, I'm going to
the movies with Jake.

722
00:36:48,892 --> 00:36:50,602
- My boy Jake?
- Yeah.

723
00:36:50,774 --> 00:36:51,934
He asked me.

724
00:36:53,777 --> 00:36:55,780
- Anyway, what scene...
- Nah.

725
00:37:42,503 --> 00:37:43,692
Fuck you, Jake!

726
00:37:43,818 --> 00:37:44,848
You was taking too long!

727
00:37:44,873 --> 00:37:45,853
Boy, that's foul.

728
00:37:45,878 --> 00:37:47,129
Shut up, Papa.

729
00:37:47,154 --> 00:37:48,666
Man, you knew I liked Andrea.

730
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:50,000
Hey! Man, that bitch

731
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,161
ain't even worth fighting over.

732
00:37:51,224 --> 00:37:52,179
Yeah.

733
00:37:52,279 --> 00:37:54,724
Fuck it. You can have her.
Hope you have fun at your movie.

734
00:37:54,724 --> 00:37:56,288
Now, both y'all need to
chill and hug this shit out.

735
00:37:56,313 --> 00:37:58,106
Man, I'm cool if he cool!

736
00:37:58,131 --> 00:37:59,517
Fuck both y'all.

737
00:38:05,399 --> 00:38:06,975
- Yo.
- What's up, man?

738
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,817
Wanna talk with you a minute.

739
00:38:09,859 --> 00:38:11,280
You up on 79th?

740
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,448
Nah.

741
00:38:12,448 --> 00:38:14,033
My son was killed up there.

742
00:38:14,033 --> 00:38:15,455
Man, I don't know nothing about that.

743
00:38:16,472 --> 00:38:17,925
Where'd you get that chain?

744
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:20,080
I found it.

745
00:38:20,105 --> 00:38:21,273
No, no, no.

746
00:38:21,302 --> 00:38:22,845
I gave my boy that chain!

747
00:38:22,877 --> 00:38:24,418
Nah, it's my chain.

748
00:38:24,418 --> 00:38:25,798
- Bullshit!
- You can't just... come on, man!

749
00:38:25,823 --> 00:38:27,300
You killed my son!

750
00:38:27,347 --> 00:38:28,692
<i>Who the fuck your son, man?</i>

751
00:38:28,756 --> 00:38:30,208
<i>I knew you were there!</i>

752
00:38:30,261 --> 00:38:32,395
<i>Now you're running around
with his shit on your neck!</i>

753
00:38:32,426 --> 00:38:34,015
<i>Please, please...</i>

754
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,255
<i>That's bullshit!</i>

755
00:38:35,308 --> 00:38:37,101
Man, your son was dead
when I found him, man!

756
00:38:37,101 --> 00:38:39,145
I told you the truth, like
I told the fucking cops!

757
00:38:39,254 --> 00:38:40,423
He was dead!

758
00:38:40,448 --> 00:38:41,799
You jacked my boy's shit

759
00:38:41,825 --> 00:38:42,982
and then you shot him.

760
00:38:42,982 --> 00:38:44,650
Fucking running around like this?

761
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:46,485
<i>It ain't what you think!</i>

762
00:38:46,485 --> 00:38:48,196
<i>I was just seeing if he was okay!</i>

763
00:38:48,196 --> 00:38:49,906
<i>Your son was dead when I found him, man!</i>

764
00:38:49,906 --> 00:38:51,240
<i>I told you like I told the fucking...</i>

765
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,825
<i>Man, I didn't do nothing!</i>

766
00:38:52,825 --> 00:38:54,577
<i>Ain't no other fucking way around this.</i>

767
00:38:54,881 --> 00:38:56,661
You got the chain that I gave him!

768
00:38:56,684 --> 00:38:58,239
Take the fucking chain, man!

769
00:38:58,264 --> 00:39:00,223
- What the fuck were you thinking?
- Take the chain, man!

770
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:21,483
Shit...

771
00:39:24,784 --> 00:39:25,978
Shit...

772
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:40,514
I...

773
00:40:46,121 --> 00:40:47,596
Yo, B. You on tonight?

774
00:40:47,677 --> 00:40:48,721
Hell, yeah.

775
00:40:48,746 --> 00:40:50,639
Hey, chef's in a fucking
mood. Don't fuck with him.

776
00:40:53,424 --> 00:40:55,047
What's up, baby? I'm walking in to work.

777
00:40:55,047 --> 00:40:56,632
<i>Brandon...</i>

778
00:40:56,632 --> 00:40:57,758
<i>It's Coogie.</i>

779
00:40:58,592 --> 00:40:59,708
<i>I'm sorry...</i>

780
00:43:20,831 --> 00:43:21,850
Amen.

781
00:43:21,875 --> 00:43:23,114
Amen.

782
00:43:37,709 --> 00:43:38,793
Good morning.

783
00:43:38,824 --> 00:43:40,117
Good morning.

784
00:43:41,259 --> 00:43:42,930
I need to make a correction,

785
00:43:42,931 --> 00:43:45,101
because it says here
in the program that, um,

786
00:43:47,697 --> 00:43:49,522
Charles Frederick Johnson

787
00:43:49,559 --> 00:43:51,235
was survived by his mother

788
00:43:51,982 --> 00:43:53,546
and older half-brother.

789
00:43:55,819 --> 00:43:58,068
It's true, we had different fathers, but...

790
00:44:00,073 --> 00:44:02,024
I loved him with my whole body,

791
00:44:02,951 --> 00:44:05,745
so I don't see how he could
have been my half-brother.

792
00:44:08,957 --> 00:44:11,096
We shared everything. We shared a room.

793
00:44:11,877 --> 00:44:14,017
He got on my whole nerves.

794
00:44:18,590 --> 00:44:19,846
And I loved him,

795
00:44:22,751 --> 00:44:24,983
and I just don't know how to say good-bye.

796
00:44:27,396 --> 00:44:29,058
I ain't even ready for this shit.

797
00:44:29,926 --> 00:44:32,304
This shit don't even feel real.

798
00:44:35,972 --> 00:44:37,798
I'm sorry for cursing, but...

799
00:44:40,841 --> 00:44:42,225
Man, Coogie was just

800
00:44:44,107 --> 00:44:45,707
so much better than me, you know?

801
00:44:46,155 --> 00:44:48,487
Smart, charming, funny...

802
00:44:49,777 --> 00:44:51,237
He'd kill me if I told y'all this,

803
00:44:51,237 --> 00:44:52,607
but he a virgin.

804
00:44:54,369 --> 00:44:56,523
Don't laugh. We shouldn't laugh, 'cause...

805
00:44:58,137 --> 00:44:59,996
It's sad that we live in a world

806
00:44:59,996 --> 00:45:01,733
where being a
16-year-old virgin

807
00:45:02,824 --> 00:45:04,042
is funny.

808
00:45:11,791 --> 00:45:13,829
You know, I was talking to...

809
00:45:14,627 --> 00:45:16,504
I was talking to God last night,

810
00:45:16,504 --> 00:45:17,630
and He told me

811
00:45:17,630 --> 00:45:18,673
the reason He took him

812
00:45:18,673 --> 00:45:20,133
is because he was better.

813
00:45:20,286 --> 00:45:21,786
He deserved better.

814
00:45:22,427 --> 00:45:24,215
He better than all this.

815
00:45:27,932 --> 00:45:29,485
And I just know I'ma miss him.

816
00:45:31,310 --> 00:45:32,764
You hear me, bro?

817
00:45:34,981 --> 00:45:36,435
I'ma miss you, G.

818
00:45:40,405 --> 00:45:41,504
Damn.

819
00:45:48,532 --> 00:45:49,977
What the fuck was that?

820
00:45:51,064 --> 00:45:52,999
Why'd you walk away from
your brother like that?

821
00:45:53,634 --> 00:45:55,126
You were supposed to be watching him.

822
00:45:55,126 --> 00:45:56,669
That's what brothers do, Brandon.

823
00:45:57,201 --> 00:45:58,463
You know, I...

824
00:45:58,463 --> 00:46:00,006
I know you ain't got
nothing to say, do you?

825
00:46:00,044 --> 00:46:02,196
Ma, really? You gotta do that right now?

826
00:46:02,311 --> 00:46:03,747
This on you, Brandon.

827
00:46:03,747 --> 00:46:05,248
- I told you, one... one night!
- What did you do?

828
00:46:05,248 --> 00:46:06,917
You didn't take care of him!

829
00:46:07,108 --> 00:46:08,806
You ain't got no right to judge me!

830
00:46:08,831 --> 00:46:10,708
You and that bougie-ass bitch right there!

831
00:46:11,124 --> 00:46:12,747
I left him with you for one night!

832
00:46:12,773 --> 00:46:14,687
Car's waiting to take us to the repast.

833
00:46:14,735 --> 00:46:15,878
I ain't going to that shit.

834
00:46:15,878 --> 00:46:17,171
What do you mean, you're skipping it?

835
00:46:17,171 --> 00:46:18,631
So she can throw salt on me?

836
00:46:18,631 --> 00:46:20,341
While I sit in some
fucking church basement,

837
00:46:20,341 --> 00:46:21,634
she gonna make it seem like

838
00:46:21,634 --> 00:46:23,052
I'm the reason that he dead!

839
00:46:23,052 --> 00:46:24,284
No, I'm not doing that shit.

840
00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:32,770
I'm not walking past
that fucking store again.

841
00:46:32,770 --> 00:46:34,313
Hey, man, me either.

842
00:46:34,313 --> 00:46:36,069
That dude could be looking for us.

843
00:46:36,858 --> 00:46:38,776
- I'm the one he saw.
<i>- Mr. Williams!</i>

844
00:46:41,612 --> 00:46:42,879
What you gonna do?

845
00:46:43,614 --> 00:46:45,682
- I'll catch y'all later.
- All right.

846
00:46:49,488 --> 00:46:51,278
Look, I ain't doing the play, all right?

847
00:46:51,377 --> 00:46:53,171
I was just trying to
holler at a little girl.

848
00:46:53,249 --> 00:46:54,710
Well, you signed up, didn't you?

849
00:46:54,784 --> 00:46:57,137
The least you can do is
be a man of your word.

850
00:46:57,659 --> 00:46:58,669
Come on.

851
00:46:58,669 --> 00:47:00,713
I wanna hear you sing something.

852
00:47:00,713 --> 00:47:02,548
- Now?
- Yep, right now.

853
00:47:02,799 --> 00:47:03,924
Here you go.

854
00:47:04,759 --> 00:47:05,861
Take that.

855
00:47:07,028 --> 00:47:08,154
Get up there.

856
00:47:08,179 --> 00:47:10,134
- But I can't!
- Oh, neither could I.

857
00:47:10,168 --> 00:47:11,322
I still can't, really,

858
00:47:11,347 --> 00:47:12,744
but I wanna see what you got.

859
00:47:13,289 --> 00:47:14,646
Get up there. Come on.

860
00:47:22,318 --> 00:47:24,385
Okay. "Slide Some Oil."

00:47:47,090 --> 00:47:48,822
Okay, no, stop. Stop laughing.

865
00:47:48,847 --> 00:47:50,065
Nope. Get back there.

866
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:51,767
Let's try it again. Come on.

867
00:47:51,822 --> 00:47:52,870
Come on, let's go.

868
00:47:53,050 --> 00:47:54,198

00:48:46,630 --> 00:48:48,786
Hey, I didn't say it
was gonna be easy, right?

882
00:48:49,372 --> 00:48:52,100
But your voice is not
unpleasant, Mr. Williams.

883
00:48:54,144 --> 00:48:55,324
Practice.

884
00:49:21,192 --> 00:49:23,341
What are you doing?
I thought you had the funeral.

885
00:49:23,443 --> 00:49:24,611
I did, but I'm good.

886
00:49:24,611 --> 00:49:25,805
No, we got it covered.

887
00:49:26,459 --> 00:49:28,753
Chef, you said you was gonna
give me a shot at the line.

888
00:49:28,753 --> 00:49:30,171
Go home. Be with your
family. You're not stepping

889
00:49:30,171 --> 00:49:31,402
in this fucking kitchen, not right now.

890
00:49:31,427 --> 00:49:33,021
Chef, okay? Please. If I fuck it up,

891
00:49:33,021 --> 00:49:34,439
I'll go home and I'll never come back.

892
00:49:34,678 --> 00:49:35,889
But I'm asking you.

893
00:49:37,090 --> 00:49:38,278
Just let me work.

894
00:49:39,758 --> 00:49:40,926
Just give me a shot, chef.

895
00:49:40,926 --> 00:49:42,208
You know I got this shit.

896
00:49:43,327 --> 00:49:44,640
<i>I'm on it, Jeff.</i>

897
00:49:47,099 --> 00:49:49,268
One spider, two shrimp,
three plank special!

898
00:49:49,268 --> 00:49:51,125
One strip, medium rare.

899
00:49:52,259 --> 00:49:54,231
All right, one soup combo,

900
00:49:54,231 --> 00:49:55,482
back of strip, medium-rare,

901
00:49:55,482 --> 00:49:57,072
spaghetti, dessert...

902
00:50:03,407 --> 00:50:05,451
Right, that fire strip,
mid-rare, yes, chef.

903
00:50:27,765 --> 00:50:29,172
You did great tonight.

904
00:50:29,975 --> 00:50:31,184
Thank you.

905
00:50:31,948 --> 00:50:33,409
I messed up a couple of times, but...

906
00:50:34,063 --> 00:50:35,439
It felt so good.

907
00:50:35,439 --> 00:50:37,369
Like, thank you so much.

908
00:50:37,394 --> 00:50:38,504
Yeah.

909
00:50:40,924 --> 00:50:43,100
You think they still got
room for me on the line?

910
00:50:44,698 --> 00:50:45,783
I'll ask.

911
00:50:45,783 --> 00:50:46,898
Thank you.

912
00:50:48,410 --> 00:50:49,967
Sorry about your little brother.

913
00:50:54,205 --> 00:50:55,500
I'm just glad you came back.

914
00:51:22,061 --> 00:51:23,547
Sorry about your brother.

915
00:51:25,052 --> 00:51:26,219
Thanks.

916
00:51:26,482 --> 00:51:27,725
He was a good kid.

917
00:51:28,144 --> 00:51:29,353
A good negotiator.

918
00:51:31,781 --> 00:51:32,949
Yeah.

919
00:51:33,628 --> 00:51:35,234
Ain't nobody at the counter, man.

920
00:51:35,267 --> 00:51:36,313
Hey, one minute.

921
00:51:36,358 --> 00:51:37,589
Oh, come on. I don't got all day.

922
00:51:37,614 --> 00:51:39,110
Have some respect, man.

923
00:51:39,994 --> 00:51:41,016
Thank you, Habib.

924
00:51:41,016 --> 00:51:42,100
Appreciate it.

925
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:43,364
His brother was killed.

926
00:51:45,275 --> 00:51:47,617
Shit. Eh, Coogie was your brother?

927
00:51:47,861 --> 00:51:49,259
- Yeah.
- I just bought some sneakers

928
00:51:49,292 --> 00:51:51,093
from him. He seemed like a cool dude.

929
00:51:52,205 --> 00:51:53,405
What happened?

930
00:51:53,405 --> 00:51:54,611
I wish I could tell you.

931
00:51:55,115 --> 00:51:56,574
Are you going to pay, or what?

932
00:51:56,791 --> 00:51:58,063
Have some respect.

933
00:51:58,793 --> 00:52:00,809
Well, listen, I heard my girl
talking about her little brother

934
00:52:00,834 --> 00:52:02,322
saw it go down, or something like that.

935
00:52:02,322 --> 00:52:03,904
- For real?
- Yeah.

936
00:52:04,818 --> 00:52:05,819
Where he at?

937
00:52:05,819 --> 00:52:06,903
Up the block.

938
00:52:06,903 --> 00:52:08,257
The one next to the empty lot.

939
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:16,995
Just tell me who shot him!

940
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:18,748
Look, I ain't telling you shit, all right?

941
00:52:18,776 --> 00:52:19,872
Look, I know you know!

942
00:52:19,899 --> 00:52:21,768
If I tell you the person
that killed your brother,

943
00:52:21,793 --> 00:52:23,211
and you kill the nigga,

944
00:52:23,296 --> 00:52:24,635
his goons gonna come after me.

945
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:26,145
Now, this conversation over.

946
00:52:26,176 --> 00:52:27,744
Move your ass, hell no.
You about to show me.

947
00:52:27,769 --> 00:52:29,002
Goddamn.

948
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:32,754
I ain't showing you shit, all right?

949
00:52:33,191 --> 00:52:35,191
For the last time, so
you can keep a-stepping.

950
00:52:35,191 --> 00:52:36,347
Look, little man.

951
00:52:36,347 --> 00:52:37,717
I give you whatever you want.

952
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:39,930
Just show me who killed my brother, bro.

953
00:52:47,078 --> 00:52:48,514
I'll take the wheels.

954
00:52:49,674 --> 00:52:51,139
You can't have that.

955
00:52:51,178 --> 00:52:53,182
It's not like your fat
ass capable of riding it.

956
00:52:53,207 --> 00:52:54,885
Look, this all I got, bro.

957
00:52:54,885 --> 00:52:56,121
I got...

958
00:52:58,288 --> 00:52:59,586
$42.

959
00:53:00,266 --> 00:53:01,308
Take this.

960
00:53:06,230 --> 00:53:07,679
And the bike.

961
00:53:15,113 --> 00:53:16,317
<i>Sell drugs?</i>

962
00:53:16,811 --> 00:53:17,991
No.

963
00:53:18,055 --> 00:53:19,283
I could tell.

964
00:53:19,975 --> 00:53:21,433
What you mean, you could tell?

965
00:53:21,433 --> 00:53:23,560
I mean, you look like a regular old person

966
00:53:23,958 --> 00:53:25,126
who does a regular old job.

967
00:53:26,011 --> 00:53:27,756
What's wrong with having a regular job?

968
00:53:27,795 --> 00:53:29,515
Sure, but you ain't got
to preach to me, nigga.

969
00:53:30,298 --> 00:53:31,542
Yeah, don't call me that.

970
00:53:31,711 --> 00:53:32,967
Only reason I called you that

971
00:53:32,967 --> 00:53:34,435
'cause I don't know your name.

972
00:53:35,428 --> 00:53:36,498
It's Brandon.

973
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:38,716
Nice to meet you, Brandon.

974
00:53:39,098 --> 00:53:40,146
Pssh.

975
00:53:41,142 --> 00:53:42,452
So this shooter...

976
00:53:42,837 --> 00:53:44,068
You see him?

977
00:53:44,548 --> 00:53:46,591
Well, so I come home from school

978
00:53:46,591 --> 00:53:48,988
when this dude jumped another dude.

979
00:53:49,428 --> 00:53:51,403
Then they started yelling about some chain.

980
00:53:52,180 --> 00:53:54,506
After that, I heard the shot.

981
00:53:55,726 --> 00:53:57,031
He say anything?

982
00:53:57,195 --> 00:53:58,874
Nothing I could hear.

983
00:53:59,493 --> 00:54:01,299
I was just scared, tried to run.

984
00:54:03,414 --> 00:54:05,176
And the dude who did the
shooting... did he see you?

985
00:54:07,877 --> 00:54:09,099
And you know him?

986
00:54:09,099 --> 00:54:10,982
I said I know where he hang, all right?

987
00:54:11,767 --> 00:54:13,561
All I'ma do is show you where he at,

988
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:14,766
so I don't get killed.

989
00:54:18,266 --> 00:54:19,596
That's the dude.

990
00:54:20,523 --> 00:54:21,733
Wait, wait, where?

991
00:54:21,733 --> 00:54:22,950
Back up, back up.

992
00:54:26,654 --> 00:54:27,740
Which one?

993
00:54:28,670 --> 00:54:29,963
The one with the hat.

994
