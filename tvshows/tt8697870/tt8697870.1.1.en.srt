2
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:04,166
Good morning, Mrs. True.

3
00:04:55,709 --> 00:04:56,917
Mrs. True.

4
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Miss Adair.

5
00:04:58,083 --> 00:05:00,709
- You look very fine.
- I think so, too.

6
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:17,166
What are you walking
around here for?
That's what I'm saying.

7
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,750
- Oh, I just...
- No, wait!

8
00:05:19,834 --> 00:05:22,333
Will you do something
about this man, please?

9
00:05:22,417 --> 00:05:24,750
Read it in "The Star"!

10
00:05:24,834 --> 00:05:27,792
Maladie kills fifth victim!

11
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:30,834
Murder spree soon to
eclipse The Ripper!

12
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:48,291
I don't suppose you know
how this all works out.

13
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:50,417
The ripplings don't come
when they're called.

14
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,125
Well, let's just
try to keep it civil.

15
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:53,875
Not like with the innkeeper.

16
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:56,417
- He had a shotgun.
- I've heard that excuse before.

17
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,583
When they have shotguns.

18
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,959
- What's the, uh, girl?
- Myrtle Haplisch.

19
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:05,041
Something to do with her voice.

20
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:07,917
Good day, Mr. Haplisch.

21
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,208
Yes.

22
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:11,166
- Are you, uh...
- I'm Amalia True.

23
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,643
This is my colleague,
Penance Adair.

24
00:06:12,667 --> 00:06:14,208
The reverend told you
we were coming?

25
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,041
Oh, yeah. About Myrtle.

26
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,458
Um, come... in.

27
00:06:19,834 --> 00:06:21,125
Missus!

28
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:24,291
Please, come through
to the, um, parlor.

29
00:06:25,667 --> 00:06:28,375
They're saying Myrtle
might be...

30
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:29,750
Touched?

31
00:06:29,834 --> 00:06:33,208
We, we heard about those girls
the last few years.

32
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:35,417
They're... not right.

33
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,750
Neither right nor wrong,
being Touched is not
a defect of character.

34
00:06:38,834 --> 00:06:40,166
But isn't that killer...

35
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,917
Mal-Maladie.
Isn't she one of them?

36
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,083
Maladie's homicidal.
I don't know if she's Touched.

37
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:46,917
- We don't know if Myrtle is.
- Oh, she's Touched, all right.

38
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,917
Touched by Red Boot Teddy!

39
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,542
We're, um, of a mind,

40
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:53,834
there's a Satanic element.

41
00:06:53,917 --> 00:06:56,375
She's Lucifer's vessel, is what.

42
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:58,250
He speaks through her.

43
00:06:58,333 --> 00:06:59,583
Up!

44
00:06:59,667 --> 00:07:03,208
Yes, uh, the reverend mentioned
an affliction of the tongue.

45
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:04,917
'Cause old Satan
is squattin' on it.

46
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,500
Spewing out his foulness,

47
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:08,976
- making a chamber pot
of our Myrtle's mouth.

48
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,667
Well, that's a bit descriptive.

49
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,583
Oh, uh, new kettle.

50
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:16,291
- It tells you when it's, um...
- Sophie!

51
00:07:20,667 --> 00:07:23,041
Is Myrtle here at home, then?

52
00:07:49,792 --> 00:07:52,667
- Why is she chained?
- Infection.

53
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,250
W-w-we got the others.

54
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:56,013
- Out. Get out.
- Get out, I say.

55
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:59,291
Myrtle was the only one
could earn a wage
with the new labor laws.

56
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:01,041
Now this.

57
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:04,583
Myrtle, I'm Penance
and that's Mrs. True.

58
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:07,458
May I sit?

59
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:17,291
Uh, we've come to help with
what's been troublin' ya.

60
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:19,667
There's plenty of girls
who've been shown

61
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,667
a strangeness of some kind.
A "turn."

62
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:26,375
But Mrs. True and I,
we've worked with them,
and they come up fine.

63
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:28,000
Would you like that?

64
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:31,250
Speak, Myrtle.

65
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:32,875
You mean, "Speak, Satan"?

66
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:39,458
See?

67
00:08:45,709 --> 00:08:48,083
Myrtle, you can
understand me, yes?

68
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:54,458
Chinese?!

69
00:08:54,542 --> 00:08:56,834
Most of it. Some of it
may have been Russian.

70
00:08:56,917 --> 00:08:59,041
And I want to say... Turkish?

71
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:01,768
- Huh.
I'd guess every known
language is crowding her mind.

72
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:04,250
How would a girl like Myrtle
learn Chinese?

73
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:05,834
She's never even seen
a Chinaman.

74
00:09:05,917 --> 00:09:07,208
Well, at least we can rule out

75
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:09,834
any sort of Satanic influence.

76
00:09:09,917 --> 00:09:12,083
- Those acrobats.
- What?

77
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:14,500
No! They just tumbled about.

78
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:17,583
They come to Barney Park
doing flips and balancing.

79
00:09:17,667 --> 00:09:19,250
They had an unnatural air.

80
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:22,083
I said it then.
And there was a monkey!

81
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:25,542
- He looked right at me.
- Yes. Well...

82
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:27,542
- Allow me to be frank...
- After being grateful

83
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:30,017
- for the chance to give Myrtle
the kind of care...

84
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:32,166
Keep them down here.

85
00:09:41,834 --> 00:09:43,709
Right.

86
00:09:58,792 --> 00:10:00,375
Gentlemen.

87
00:10:01,792 --> 00:10:03,250
Might we be civil?

88
00:10:13,667 --> 00:10:15,208
You bitch!

89
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,959
Penance!

90
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:21,458
Shiner!

91
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,250
Aah!

92
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:29,166
Get the carriage!

93
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:37,083
Da! The lady did a wrestle!

94
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:39,250
Aah!

95
00:11:02,667 --> 00:11:04,500
Come on. Let's go!

96
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:17,208
Now! Myrtle, run!

97
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:18,959
True!

98
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:46,291
Did you see that face?

99
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:48,601
- I think I preferred when
people just had shotguns.

100
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,625
Oh, no. No, I didn't.

101
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:01,000
We can't outrun them.
We're going to have
to change it out.

102
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:03,709
Uh, you mean...
It's only a prototype.

103
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:19,125
This is weird for us, too.

104
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:34,500
Heads down!

105
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:44,417
Out of the way!

106
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:49,709
One side!

107
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:12,000
I, I think it's best if you
come stay with us for a bit.

108
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:13,667
If that suits ya.

109
00:13:16,542 --> 00:13:17,935
We can, we can deal
with those fellas.

110
00:13:17,959 --> 00:13:20,792
We can find out what they want,
or what they...

111
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:24,625
are. How are we gonna
deal with those fellas?

112
00:13:24,709 --> 00:13:26,083
True?

113
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:30,917
We're going to the opera.

114
00:13:32,792 --> 00:13:34,792
See? We already got a plan.

115
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,542
It's just a woman.

116
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:10,542
Five men murdered.
I'd say she's more than that.

117
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:12,750
Yes, murder.

118
00:14:12,834 --> 00:14:14,625
Very distressing.

119
00:14:14,709 --> 00:14:16,625
This "Maladie" is a lunatic.

120
00:14:16,709 --> 00:14:19,208
Scotland Yard has their
Special Detail to catch her.

121
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:23,500
What matter if she's Touched?
This is beneath us.

122
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:26,041
She is not killing whores,
your grace.

123
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:28,041
These are respectable men.

124
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:29,333
Psychoanalysts.

125
00:14:29,417 --> 00:14:31,542
Well, the Prime Minister
intends to take

126
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:34,125
a public position
on the Touched.

127
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:35,542
We need to decide what it is.

128
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:38,125
A few women pulling
parlor tricks...

129
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:39,875
It's not just women.

130
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:42,083
And it's not a few.

131
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:43,875
There are hundreds, at least,

132
00:14:43,959 --> 00:14:46,542
of unique,
inexplicable afflictions.

133
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:48,792
Lavinia Bidlow has made
a cause of them.

134
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:51,375
Which is why the PM
needs to take a...

135
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:52,917
Women are being attacked,

136
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,041
accused of witchcraft,
or some island voodoo,
and...

137
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:57,583
Fairy stories.

138
00:14:57,667 --> 00:15:00,166
These are biological anomalies,

139
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:03,250
caused by electricity.

140
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:05,959
Uh, Lord Massen?

141
00:15:08,834 --> 00:15:11,375
A girl started in
my engine works last month

142
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:13,417
wiping down the plating press.

143
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,750
She slipped.
Got her arm caught
in the press.

144
00:15:16,834 --> 00:15:19,333
And then she pulled it back out.

145
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:22,291
Three tons of pressure,

146
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:26,041
and she snapped the hydraulic
without so much as a bruise.

147
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:28,959
- People cheered.
Well, I say enlist her.

148
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:31,041
Point her at the bloody Boers.

149
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:33,959
A machine breaks.
Again, gentlemen,

150
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:35,709
this isn't a troop deployment,

151
00:15:35,792 --> 00:15:38,500
or a, a market crash.

152
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:45,959
The Prime Minister
will not be taking
a position on the Touched.

153
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:49,750
Nor will he allow any official
debate on the subject.

154
00:15:49,834 --> 00:15:54,000
Not until we understand
the nature and breadth
of the attack.

155
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:56,792
- Attack?
- You're declaring the Touched

156
00:15:56,875 --> 00:15:58,959
a direct threat
against the empire.

157
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,542
- Which we here
are sworn to protect.

158
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:04,375
Contra hostes omnes.

159
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:08,166
And this attack is expected
to come...

160
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,333
It came three years ago.

161
00:16:10,417 --> 00:16:13,834
Third of August, 1896.

162
00:16:13,917 --> 00:16:18,000
A Monday. Rather gray.

163
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:22,166
Not one case of someone
being Touched before then.

164
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,375
Not one outside London.

165
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:27,166
Those reported overseas
were all here at the time.

166
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:31,417
And not one man
of stature afflicted.

167
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:35,208
That's the genius of it.

168
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:38,500
They came at us
through our women.

169
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:39,959
"They"?

170
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:42,709
I'm still not sure
I can equate a few
bizarre anecdotes

171
00:16:42,792 --> 00:16:43,959
with the Mongol horde.

172
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:47,041
Only a blind man measures
the length of a blade

173
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:48,709
by how much is in his belly.

174
00:16:48,792 --> 00:16:51,667
- Your overstep the mark, Massen.
- This was designed

175
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:54,166
so that we would see
the parts...

176
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,208
and not the whole.

177
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:58,625
Philanthropists
like Lavinia Bidlow

178
00:16:58,709 --> 00:17:01,000
see the suffering
of the afflicted.

179
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:04,166
The common throng see
a macabre murderess.

180
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:06,375
And you see a broken machine.

181
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:09,000
That is exactly what I see.

182
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:10,542
The greatest machine.

183
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:13,667
The heart of our empire
brought to a shuddering halt

184
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:16,500
by the caprice
and ambitions of those

185
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:19,625
for whom ambition
was never meant.

186
00:17:19,709 --> 00:17:22,583
This is the Age of Power.

187
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:25,375
- New power.
- The X-ray.

188
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:27,500
- The wireless.
- Electricity.

189
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:31,667
We are the first generation
accustomed to the impossible.

190
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,917
What women are
appalled by today,

191
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,417
they will accept tomorrow,

192
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,125
and demand the day after that.

193
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:40,625
And the immigrant.
And the deviant.

194
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:44,417
- That is the power
being wielded,

195
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,208
and not by us.

196
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:50,959
The blade is in, gentlemen.

197
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:54,834
We need to know whose hand
is on the hilt.

198
00:17:59,959 --> 00:18:01,667
Nobody gets through.

199
00:18:13,542 --> 00:18:15,041
Put your back into it, Jones,

200
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:17,333
- you lazy...
- Yes, sir.

201
00:18:17,417 --> 00:18:19,959
We get any further behind,
I'll pluck the lot of ya!

202
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:23,375
Not in front of the officer.
Show some respect.

203
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:26,959
Detective Mundi.

204
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:29,458
You're the Special Detail, yeah?

205
00:18:29,542 --> 00:18:32,083
- You're gonna wanna see this.
- Am I?

206
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,709
Mind your head.

207
00:18:41,959 --> 00:18:43,792
Was a digger stumbled on her.

208
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:46,542
Near had a kiss, they did.

209
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:49,166
Here. You see the stab wounds?

210
00:18:51,542 --> 00:18:53,959
These mates brung
the torches in.

211
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,875
They spotted this on the wall.

212
00:18:56,959 --> 00:18:59,208
That's how they knew
it was one of hers.

213
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:00,875
It's a message.

214
00:19:01,667 --> 00:19:03,375
Not from Maladie.

215
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:05,500
But how can you be sure?

216
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:07,208
She can spell.

217
00:19:08,417 --> 00:19:11,667
Did he recognize the victim?
The digger?

218
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:12,875
No.

219
00:19:12,959 --> 00:19:15,583
Well, not much to recognize,
the rats having had a go.

220
00:19:15,667 --> 00:19:19,792
You get vagrants and drunks
taking shelter down here
all the time.

221
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:22,417
Mmm. This woman was neither.

222
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,208
Where does this lead?

223
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,643
It was meant to be
the maintenance tunnel

224
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:29,834
for the southern line,
but it got scrapped.

225
00:19:29,917 --> 00:19:32,875
There's too much to do,
expanding the underground.

226
00:19:34,917 --> 00:19:37,542
The city'll fall in on itself.

227
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:39,458
I don't envy you this job.

228
00:19:39,542 --> 00:19:41,166
- Yeah.
- Who moved the body?

229
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:44,291
Must have been... Wait. What?

230
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:48,166
- No, it was there.
- She wasn't killed there.

231
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:52,000
And her blood's been dry
a lot longer than this pig's.

232
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:53,458
No. It's not... Oi.

233
00:19:53,542 --> 00:19:55,458
You're tossing about
a lot of assumptions.

234
00:19:55,542 --> 00:19:57,500
Clearly I meant to.

235
00:19:57,583 --> 00:20:00,041
Right. Shut this lot down.
Line 'em up.

236
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:01,750
- No...
- We check every man in here

237
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:03,333
for blood on his hands
or his clothes.

238
00:20:03,417 --> 00:20:06,041
You, you can't stop the dig.
We got a schedule to keep.

239
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:08,542
And what's a murder to that, eh?

240
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:12,542
What? You think you're
the first to try and pin
something on Maladie?

241
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:15,709
People think every Touched
they meet might be her.

242
00:20:15,792 --> 00:20:18,625
And some of them Touched,
they're weird enough.
They are.

243
00:20:18,709 --> 00:20:21,583
Make your skin crawl.
But here's you,

244
00:20:21,667 --> 00:20:25,917
letting a killer get off
by making it harder
to catch another one.

245
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,709
- For a schedule.
- I know about you,
Frank Mundi.

246
00:20:29,792 --> 00:20:32,208
East End Ape.
Always fists first.

247
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:34,250
He could beat a confession
out of a headstone.

248
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:35,959
You can play the righteous man,

249
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:37,917
but even you answer to someone.

250
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,917
Yes, I do. She's right there.

251
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,417
Now, that woman faced
an horrible end.

252
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,417
And I don't think
you killed her,

253
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,375
but I'm not letting you
bury her.

254
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:51,750
What about the Special Detail?

255
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:54,208
If it's not Maladie done this,
then it's not your case.

256
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:56,458
- Oh, no. Maladie done this,
didn't she?

257
00:20:56,542 --> 00:20:58,125
Because she left a message.

258
00:20:58,208 --> 00:21:01,041
So you're gonna tell me
what was here before
you dressed it up,

259
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:04,291
'cause one more lie,
and I'm not on a case,

260
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:07,458
I'm the fucking
"Angle" of Death.

261
00:21:36,417 --> 00:21:37,792
Leave the doors!

262
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:40,667
Mrs. True's back with a new one.

263
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:43,875
They's in Penance's...
Uh, the prolatype.

264
00:21:43,959 --> 00:21:46,250
What, the auto-carriage?

265
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:49,166
It's mad.
Primrose, you got to see.

266
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,333
Mother says motorcars
are common.

267
00:21:51,417 --> 00:21:54,583
Common? There's only eight
of them that ever were.

268
00:21:54,667 --> 00:21:56,083
I wouldn't expect you
to understand,

269
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:57,625
but Mother says
they're a blight.

270
00:21:57,709 --> 00:22:00,291
Yeah? She say that lately?

271
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:02,417
On a visit, maybe,
that we all missed.

272
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:06,083
- As though you know anything
about being a mother.
Primrose!

273
00:22:09,667 --> 00:22:13,208
- She didn't mean that.
- Does she think she's
too big for a spanking?

274
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:15,583
Coming through!

275
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,041
- All right.
- All right, come on.

276
00:22:30,125 --> 00:22:33,792
Don't suffocate them.
It's only a carriage.

277
00:22:34,792 --> 00:22:35,917
No?

278
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,542
That's fuckin' amazing.

279
00:22:37,625 --> 00:22:40,417
Myrtle, this is
Dr. Horatio Cousens.
He swears a lot.

280
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,709
No, I don't.

281
00:22:42,792 --> 00:22:45,667
- How was your journey?
- Eventful.

282
00:22:47,542 --> 00:22:50,375
Lucy, I need to send a letter
to Mrs. Bidlow.

283
00:22:50,458 --> 00:22:51,875
Let her know about the attack.

284
00:22:51,959 --> 00:22:53,500
Attack? What attack?

285
00:22:53,583 --> 00:22:55,542
Lucy. Pen. Paper.

286
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:56,875
I'll set up in your rooms.

287
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:58,750
- Shop talk first.
- Not first.

288
00:22:58,834 --> 00:23:00,417
This is just a scratch.

289
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:08,083
- Primrose?
- I can't ride it in,

290
00:23:08,166 --> 00:23:09,810
- so I don't see what...
- No, it's just...

291
00:23:09,834 --> 00:23:13,417
I recalled you saying
you didn't have anyone
your own age to talk to.

292
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,959
Oh!

293
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,083
I'm Miss Chattoway.

294
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:22,583
But you may call me Primrose.

295
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:24,792
I hope we'll be friends.

296
00:23:24,875 --> 00:23:27,917
So what's your "turn"?
I'm large.

297
00:23:30,834 --> 00:23:33,458
Myrtle has a language situation,

298
00:23:33,542 --> 00:23:35,583
and I imagine
she could use a cup of tea.

299
00:23:35,667 --> 00:23:38,625
Oh. Um, do you want...

300
00:23:38,709 --> 00:23:40,834
She does speak English.

301
00:23:41,875 --> 00:23:43,750
But not with her mouth.

302
00:23:45,917 --> 00:23:48,500
All right. Come with me.

303
00:23:52,667 --> 00:23:54,709
We should be married in this.

304
00:23:57,875 --> 00:23:59,458
How is this new?

305
00:23:59,542 --> 00:24:02,041
People been attacking us
since they known we was Touched.

306
00:24:02,125 --> 00:24:04,750
- Or since always.
- This is different.

307
00:24:04,834 --> 00:24:06,291
This whole day.

308
00:24:06,375 --> 00:24:09,083
We knew people would
come down on us
the more we were thriving.

309
00:24:09,166 --> 00:24:12,000
Why would they want this...

310
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:13,417
Myrtle?

311
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,375
I don't think she's the first.

312
00:24:15,458 --> 00:24:17,500
I think they've been
doing this for some time.

313
00:24:17,583 --> 00:24:20,458
All those girls we went after
who'd "just run away"?

314
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:22,083
Lord.

315
00:24:24,125 --> 00:24:25,667
We need to bolster our security.

316
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:28,000
All entrances, windows
bolted or blocked.

317
00:24:28,083 --> 00:24:30,000
I could rig up
a few surprises, as well.

318
00:24:30,083 --> 00:24:32,250
Nothing lethal,
but very discouraging.

319
00:24:32,333 --> 00:24:34,834
Everyone signs in and out.
Time and destination.

320
00:24:34,917 --> 00:24:36,500
No one goes out alone
or after dark.

321
00:24:36,583 --> 00:24:39,333
- Not even visitors.
- One time.

322
00:24:39,417 --> 00:24:41,257
I've been showing the girls
a bit of scrapping.

323
00:24:41,333 --> 00:24:43,667
- You'll show them all.
- But not using their "turns."

324
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:45,768
Well, there's plenty you can do
with what's at hand.

325
00:24:45,792 --> 00:24:48,500
It's about confidence.
As my mum used to say,

326
00:24:48,583 --> 00:24:50,333
if you can look a man
in the eye,

327
00:24:50,417 --> 00:24:51,792
you can stab him in it.

328
00:24:51,875 --> 00:24:53,000
Smart woman.

329
00:24:53,083 --> 00:24:55,000
But also, don't do that.

330
00:24:55,083 --> 00:24:57,250
The Beggar King.
Tell him I need to see him.

331
00:24:59,959 --> 00:25:01,250
We pay him for protection,

332
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,458
and he's been feeding us
potential candidates.

333
00:25:03,542 --> 00:25:05,875
I need to know if
he's been feeding
anyone else.

334
00:25:05,959 --> 00:25:09,208
Here, first thing tomorrow.
Put word on the street.

335
00:25:09,291 --> 00:25:11,291
That's not how it works,
Mrs. True.

336
00:25:11,375 --> 00:25:14,375
Amalia, you don't just ask
the Beggar King to come calling.

337
00:25:14,458 --> 00:25:16,959
I am, in fact, not asking.

338
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,500
All right.

339
00:25:20,583 --> 00:25:21,875
Better tend to that scratch,

340
00:25:21,959 --> 00:25:24,583
since you're in such a hurry
to make new enemies.

341
00:26:14,333 --> 00:26:16,500
Augustus Bidlow to see you, sir.

342
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:27,834
Augie, sorry I kept you waiting.

343
00:26:27,917 --> 00:26:31,291
Did I keep you waiting?
I'm at odds with time.

344
00:26:31,375 --> 00:26:33,125
They're unhappy.

345
00:26:33,208 --> 00:26:35,959
Who? The Humphries?
Of course they're unhappy.
They're old.

346
00:26:36,041 --> 00:26:37,834
The crows.

347
00:26:37,917 --> 00:26:40,542
- They shouldn't be
massing here.
Crows...

348
00:26:40,625 --> 00:26:43,959
- Do you mean to say
we're witnessing a murder?

349
00:26:44,041 --> 00:26:45,959
You know I hate that term.

350
00:26:46,041 --> 00:26:48,625
So unfair, "a murder of crows."

351
00:26:48,709 --> 00:26:50,685
Crows are actually lovely.
They're intelligent creatures.

352
00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:52,500
Why is it an
"exaltation of larks"?

353
00:26:52,583 --> 00:26:54,810
- Larks are not at all as soc...
- Not at all as social.

354
00:26:54,834 --> 00:26:57,250
Yes, Augie, your radical stance
on avian nomenclature

355
00:26:57,333 --> 00:27:00,166
- hasn't changed since Eton.
- No, thank you.

356
00:27:02,375 --> 00:27:05,625
I think they're here
as a Greek chorus
to your distemper.

357
00:27:05,709 --> 00:27:07,792
So...

358
00:27:07,875 --> 00:27:10,208
what has you so ruffled?

359
00:27:10,291 --> 00:27:13,458
I assume your sister
is angry about something.

360
00:27:13,542 --> 00:27:14,417
No.

361
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:17,208
I just... I, I've done
something stupid.

362
00:27:17,291 --> 00:27:19,291
And that's not why she's...

363
00:27:19,375 --> 00:27:20,834
Fu...

364
00:27:22,625 --> 00:27:24,542
She... This.

365
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:28,291
You know Lavinia's
charity endeavor?

366
00:27:28,375 --> 00:27:29,500
The Touched.

367
00:27:29,583 --> 00:27:31,333
Yes. The, uh...

368
00:27:31,417 --> 00:27:33,208
- The Orphanage.
- Orphans. Right.

369
00:27:33,291 --> 00:27:36,500
- No. The Touched.
- Yes. They're terrible.

370
00:27:36,583 --> 00:27:38,417
They're wonderful.

371
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,667
They're absurd.

372
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:42,184
Do you even know
what the term means?

373
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:44,500
"Touched"? Yes! No.

374
00:27:44,583 --> 00:27:46,542
Uh, they're all, uh, they have,

375
00:27:46,625 --> 00:27:48,875
uh, weird, um,
deformities and afflictions.

376
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:51,917
And... Oh! Um.
Alderton Musgrove has
a niece who can float.

377
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,375
- Really?
- Yeah.

378
00:27:53,458 --> 00:27:54,726
Just an inch or so
off the ground.

379
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:57,375
She can't go anywhere
unless you tow her about.

380
00:27:57,458 --> 00:27:59,208
Musgrove is apoplectic.

381
00:27:59,291 --> 00:28:02,291
I'm not supposed to tell.

382
00:28:02,375 --> 00:28:05,375
Oh, and, uh, Lavinia's opened a,
a home for them.

383
00:28:05,458 --> 00:28:07,458
And it's all rather
controversial,

384
00:28:07,542 --> 00:28:08,583
- and...
- And...

385
00:28:08,667 --> 00:28:10,709
she, she, she just now got word

386
00:28:10,792 --> 00:28:12,333
from the widow
who runs the affair.

387
00:28:12,417 --> 00:28:14,917
Some Touched girl was attacked.

388
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,208
I mean, the girl's fine,
but Lavinia, she's aflame.

389
00:28:19,291 --> 00:28:20,959
"It's time society accepted

390
00:28:21,041 --> 00:28:22,810
that the Touched are
amongst us, and they're..."

391
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:26,375
And I said, "Well,
they're not amongst us.

392
00:28:26,458 --> 00:28:28,667
You know, they're in
The Orphanage."

393
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:30,625
And she called me a genius.

394
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:33,500
Which is worse than when
she calls me an idiot,
because...

395
00:28:33,583 --> 00:28:36,250
I, I never know what she...

396
00:28:36,333 --> 00:28:38,291
She's bringing them
to the opera.

397
00:28:40,667 --> 00:28:43,083
Tonight! In our box.

398
00:28:43,166 --> 00:28:46,125
She's ousted the Van Alders
for these wo-women.

399
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:48,125
I'm to make the fourth.

400
00:28:48,208 --> 00:28:50,750
- Are they hideous?
- I've no idea.

401
00:28:50,834 --> 00:28:52,458
It's, um...

402
00:28:52,542 --> 00:28:54,667
It's, it's, it's the widow,
Mrs. True,

403
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:56,750
I think, and her companion.

404
00:28:56,834 --> 00:28:58,625
Do you think
they might be hideous?

405
00:28:58,709 --> 00:29:01,583
Well, whatever they are,
flirt with the ugly one.

406
00:29:01,667 --> 00:29:03,834
It creates an unexpected
balance.

407
00:29:03,917 --> 00:29:06,166
I don't know how to flirt.

408
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:09,083
God, these people
make me uneasy.

409
00:29:09,166 --> 00:29:11,959
What if she's some sort of
Elephant Man woman?

410
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:14,667
Well, then, she's probably
the ugly one.

411
00:29:15,667 --> 00:29:17,583
You have to come.

412
00:29:17,667 --> 00:29:19,875
Oh! To the opera?

413
00:29:19,959 --> 00:29:22,291
Well, you know everything
about flirting.

414
00:29:22,375 --> 00:29:26,125
- Plus, you don't mind
when people are odd.

415
00:29:26,208 --> 00:29:27,625
It's how we're friends.

416
00:29:27,709 --> 00:29:30,125
But it's "Faust"!

417
00:29:30,208 --> 00:29:31,834
Please?

418
00:29:31,917 --> 00:29:35,208
I'll do anything. I mean...

419
00:29:35,291 --> 00:29:37,208
People are already
saying unkind things

420
00:29:37,291 --> 00:29:39,959
about Lavinia's passion
on the subject.

421
00:29:40,041 --> 00:29:42,458
- If this whole thing
doesn't go smoothly...
- Mmm-mmm.

422
00:29:42,542 --> 00:29:45,000
I've got a very
important meeting with
the Minister of Finance

423
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:47,625
about The Ferryman's
next Midnight Carouse.

424
00:29:47,709 --> 00:29:49,542
The Ferryman's? I don't...

425
00:29:49,625 --> 00:29:51,792
Sorry, wh-what does
the Minister of Finance
have to do

426
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:53,166
with your pagan sex club?

427
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:55,792
Whatever he has to do
to get the pictures I have

428
00:29:55,875 --> 00:29:57,375
from the last one.

429
00:29:57,458 --> 00:29:58,959
That's how the club works.

430
00:29:59,041 --> 00:30:02,291
It's all quite delicate.
Favors and threats,
and then,

431
00:30:02,375 --> 00:30:07,417
one shining night
where no law yet exists.

432
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:11,417
It's more than just a club.
It's an ethos.

433
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:14,417
And I won't sit
through three hours
of moralistic bellowing

434
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,000
with everyone I know and hate,

435
00:30:16,083 --> 00:30:18,500
just because
Lavinia's gone weird.

436
00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:20,291
She's not weird.

437
00:30:27,875 --> 00:30:29,375
I'm an ape.

438
00:30:30,583 --> 00:30:33,458
- But she does push you around.
- I know.

439
00:30:34,125 --> 00:30:35,792
I know.

440
00:30:38,417 --> 00:30:41,250
I will come tonight.

441
00:30:43,333 --> 00:30:44,959
If...

442
00:30:45,041 --> 00:30:47,125
No. Me?

443
00:30:47,208 --> 00:30:50,000
At The Ferryman's?
No. Hugo, no. Please. I...

444
00:30:50,083 --> 00:30:52,125
Sex club is just...

445
00:30:52,208 --> 00:30:55,083
That's just flirting
on a much scarier level.

446
00:30:55,166 --> 00:30:57,083
You don't have to flirt.

447
00:30:57,166 --> 00:30:59,917
You just have to relax.

448
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,166
Endure someone
flirting with you.

449
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:05,583
These are my terms.

450
00:31:23,291 --> 00:31:24,917
Oh, he's a pokey one.

451
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,333
As far as society is concerned,

452
00:31:27,417 --> 00:31:30,125
Augustus Bidlow
is above reproach,

453
00:31:30,208 --> 00:31:33,125
and beneath contempt.

454
00:31:33,208 --> 00:31:35,834
- He's perfect.
- For what?

455
00:31:37,208 --> 00:31:39,750
You don't have to
wear that anymore.

456
00:31:39,834 --> 00:31:43,500
Oh. Right. You are the maid.

457
00:31:52,542 --> 00:31:53,959
I like watching you work.

458
00:31:54,041 --> 00:31:56,083
It's like you're conducting.

459
00:31:56,166 --> 00:31:59,375
Well, get in wrong
with the Beggar King,

460
00:31:59,458 --> 00:32:01,125
and you'll get a symphony.

461
00:32:01,208 --> 00:32:03,583
You shouldn't be in that life.

462
00:32:03,667 --> 00:32:06,083
Gift like yours,
you should be
the Royal physician,

463
00:32:06,166 --> 00:32:08,000
not patching up gangsters
and freaks.

464
00:32:08,083 --> 00:32:11,834
Gift like mine gets me branded
a voodoo witch doctor.

465
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,291
I gave up being choosy.

466
00:32:19,375 --> 00:32:21,834
Nothing about me
not being a freak?

467
00:32:26,291 --> 00:32:27,875
Oh, no, just come in.
It's only surgery.

468
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,417
Oh, right.

469
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,291
I'm going to the opera tonight.

470
00:32:37,375 --> 00:32:39,500
I had a rippling.

471
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:42,291
"...to accompany me
and my brother Augustus

472
00:32:42,375 --> 00:32:44,625
"to the opening performance
of 'Faust.'

473
00:32:44,709 --> 00:32:47,041
Lavinia Bidlow."

474
00:32:50,667 --> 00:32:52,750
So you send word that
you'd just been attacked,

475
00:32:52,834 --> 00:32:54,709
and she says,
"Come out to play."

476
00:32:54,792 --> 00:32:56,583
She even sent an outfit.

477
00:32:56,667 --> 00:32:58,583
And what about the part
where you rest?

478
00:32:58,667 --> 00:33:01,083
It's the theater,
not hard labor.

479
00:33:02,125 --> 00:33:03,834
And I...

480
00:33:03,917 --> 00:33:06,125
Think I need to be there.

481
00:33:07,166 --> 00:33:08,625
Trouble?

482
00:33:10,458 --> 00:33:11,875
Hmm.

483
00:33:19,625 --> 00:33:21,417
Katherine will have
supper ready soon.

484
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:25,208
Does Lavinia really think
I can fit into this?

485
00:33:25,291 --> 00:33:27,041
It's a good dress for you.

486
00:33:29,458 --> 00:33:32,083
It'll keep pressure
on the wound.

487
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:41,709
- Mrs. True.
- Miss Adair.

488
00:33:41,792 --> 00:33:43,625
You look very fine.

489
00:33:43,709 --> 00:33:45,625
I think so, too.

490
00:33:52,625 --> 00:33:55,458
It's like something
from a storybook.

491
00:34:05,333 --> 00:34:07,375
I'm not confident
in my curtsying.

492
00:34:07,458 --> 00:34:09,041
I'm not confident
in my breathing.

493
00:34:09,125 --> 00:34:10,792
Oh, I wasn't planning
to breathe.

494
00:34:10,875 --> 00:34:12,917
I think it's considered rude.

495
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,750
- Does it hurt?
- Itches.

496
00:34:14,834 --> 00:34:17,250
Aah, that's much worse.

497
00:34:17,333 --> 00:34:19,333
Are you sure
we need to go to this?

498
00:34:19,417 --> 00:34:20,851
You have to say yes
or I'll cry, but...

499
00:34:20,875 --> 00:34:23,041
We need to go to this.

500
00:34:24,333 --> 00:34:26,166
Wish I knew why.

501
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:47,417
Aah...

502
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,333
Give us the room.

503
00:34:50,542 --> 00:34:53,834
That's Odium. Pardon the stench.

504
00:34:53,917 --> 00:34:56,959
You cannot get that man
into a bath.

505
00:34:57,041 --> 00:34:58,500
Declan Orrun.

506
00:34:58,583 --> 00:35:00,458
The Beggar King.

507
00:35:00,542 --> 00:35:02,291
Or, no...

508
00:35:02,375 --> 00:35:05,125
- Mr. Orrun, Penance Adair.
- Yeah, I know.

509
00:35:05,208 --> 00:35:09,083
- The great inventress.
- Oh, I'm not great.

510
00:35:09,166 --> 00:35:12,000
I assume
you've heard about...
- Do you know how it looks?

511
00:35:12,083 --> 00:35:14,500
Every rum on the street
hearing you calling me

512
00:35:14,583 --> 00:35:16,667
come like a bitch puppy?

513
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:19,208
- There's channels.
- We were attacked today.

514
00:35:19,291 --> 00:35:20,458
Only once?

515
00:35:20,542 --> 00:35:24,041
They came for Myrtle Haplisch
same time we did.

516
00:35:24,125 --> 00:35:26,125
Probably been after
the Touched for some time,

517
00:35:26,208 --> 00:35:27,625
but now they've been seen.

518
00:35:27,709 --> 00:35:29,542
They're a danger to us,
and I'd suspect,

519
00:35:29,625 --> 00:35:31,542
anyone known to be
connected with us.

520
00:35:31,625 --> 00:35:35,458
Which you made sure
I was known
far and wide to be.

521
00:35:35,542 --> 00:35:38,375
You called me out,
so I'd be forced to help you.

522
00:35:38,458 --> 00:35:41,542
And now you've
told me that to my face.

523
00:35:41,625 --> 00:35:45,709
I'm genuinely searching
for a way that this spins out...

524
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:48,125
that I don't kill you.

525
00:35:48,208 --> 00:35:51,083
It would be better
if you didn't.

526
00:35:51,166 --> 00:35:54,291
You're a rare fuckin' bird.

527
00:35:54,375 --> 00:35:56,417
You sold us the information
about Myrtle.

528
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:59,500
And you're wondering
if I sold it to someone else.

529
00:35:59,583 --> 00:36:01,667
Well, wonder away, princess.

530
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:04,000
My business is mine.

531
00:36:04,083 --> 00:36:07,208
Apart from the sanctity
of my harmonious marriage,

532
00:36:07,291 --> 00:36:10,208
fuck-all is exclusive.

533
00:36:10,291 --> 00:36:13,125
My girls need protection,
and I need information.

534
00:36:13,208 --> 00:36:17,333
Exclusive, about who's hunting
the Touched, and why.

535
00:36:17,417 --> 00:36:19,542
Skip the posture
and name your price.

536
00:36:19,625 --> 00:36:21,542
You ain't got that kind of swag.

537
00:36:21,625 --> 00:36:23,375
We're resourceful.

538
00:36:23,458 --> 00:36:27,583
Is that so?
How 'bout you get me
the Crown fucking Jewels?

539
00:36:33,375 --> 00:36:35,208
Wait, are you considering that?

540
00:36:35,291 --> 00:36:37,792
We'll start with a gift
for today's thoughtlessness.

541
00:36:37,875 --> 00:36:42,083
An automated motor-carriage,
designed to your specifications.

542
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:45,125
And you will be paid,
if you help us.

543
00:36:53,041 --> 00:36:56,166
You're mad enough
to make this worth it.

544
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:58,208
But you're mad enough
to try not to.

545
00:36:58,291 --> 00:37:02,667
If it goes that way,
I will cut your face
to a mess.

546
00:37:04,834 --> 00:37:06,834
This isn't my face.

547
00:37:16,709 --> 00:37:19,166
I thought you was gonna
scare them.

548
00:37:20,166 --> 00:37:22,583
Spread out your fingers.

549
00:37:22,667 --> 00:37:25,583
- Wait.
- Hold up your hand,

550
00:37:25,667 --> 00:37:29,792
and spread out your
fuckin' fingers.

551
00:38:12,792 --> 00:38:14,834
Hugo, get off!

552
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:15,959
I have to go!

553
00:38:16,041 --> 00:38:18,250
I'm done after the cavern ballet
in act five,

554
00:38:18,333 --> 00:38:20,041
right before the prison scene.

555
00:38:21,834 --> 00:38:23,875
Hugo? You listening?

556
00:38:23,959 --> 00:38:26,000
Yes. The prison scene.

557
00:38:26,083 --> 00:38:28,333
Yes.

558
00:38:32,792 --> 00:38:34,625
Don't you agree, Miss Bidlow?

559
00:38:34,709 --> 00:38:37,291
Must we fight a war over words?

560
00:38:37,375 --> 00:38:39,583
I'm exhausted by these
overwrought alarums

561
00:38:39,667 --> 00:38:42,041
about the Frenchification
of our language.

562
00:38:42,125 --> 00:38:43,875
It's the end of the century.

563
00:38:43,959 --> 00:38:47,375
These ancient prejudices
have no use.

564
00:38:47,458 --> 00:38:49,250
Dr. Beldon,

565
00:38:49,333 --> 00:38:51,250
you adopt new terms
as they become relevant

566
00:38:51,333 --> 00:38:53,875
to your practice
of psychoanalysis,
I imagine.

567
00:38:53,959 --> 00:38:56,000
Practically every week of late.

568
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:59,834
Language requires not stasis,
but specificity.

569
00:38:59,917 --> 00:39:03,208
I should be thrilled
to excise the word "nice."

570
00:39:03,291 --> 00:39:05,101
It's vague as paste.
Isn't that right, Augustus?

571
00:39:05,125 --> 00:39:06,375
Augustus.

572
00:39:06,458 --> 00:39:09,041
- Sorry?
- We were discussing
it earlier.

573
00:39:09,125 --> 00:39:12,041
The specificity
of modern language.

574
00:39:12,125 --> 00:39:14,375
Oh, yes. Yes, yes, yes.

575
00:39:14,458 --> 00:39:16,083
It's very nice.

576
00:39:16,166 --> 00:39:18,601
If it's,
uh, French terminology
we're discussing,

577
00:39:18,625 --> 00:39:19,917
there are a few terms

578
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,542
we Britons simply
don't have a word for.

579
00:39:23,625 --> 00:39:26,000
Oh, excuse me.

580
00:39:26,083 --> 00:39:30,125
I suppose we all know
the sort of terms he means.

581
00:39:30,208 --> 00:39:32,542
What on Earth
is Swann doing here?

582
00:39:32,625 --> 00:39:34,709
I...

583
00:39:34,792 --> 00:39:36,375
No, I know.

584
00:39:36,458 --> 00:39:38,375
S-so impulsive...

585
00:39:38,458 --> 00:39:41,000
Lord Massen.
You're well, I hope.

586
00:39:41,083 --> 00:39:45,291
I am, Miss Bidlow. Thank you.
Dr. Beldon, hello. Swann.

587
00:39:45,375 --> 00:39:48,125
We were discussing the panic
a few old men are having

588
00:39:48,208 --> 00:39:49,667
about certain French terms.

589
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:53,208
There was one debated
on the Parliament floor.
What was it?

590
00:39:53,291 --> 00:39:54,625
"Employees."

591
00:39:54,709 --> 00:39:57,959
Employees.
And here we say it,
and yet live.

592
00:39:58,041 --> 00:40:01,291
It is not panicking
to abhor something.

593
00:40:01,375 --> 00:40:03,792
Neither is it useful to replace

594
00:40:03,875 --> 00:40:06,083
a perfectly good
Anglo-Saxon word

595
00:40:06,166 --> 00:40:07,875
with some foreigner's flourish.

596
00:40:07,959 --> 00:40:09,917
In England,
we say "the employed."

597
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,125
What possible benefit
in replacing it with
"employees"?

598
00:40:14,208 --> 00:40:16,250
The singular.

599
00:40:16,333 --> 00:40:18,750
One may refer to
a single employee,

600
00:40:18,834 --> 00:40:20,166
whereas "the employed"

601
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:23,000
can only be used to describe
a mass of people.

602
00:40:23,083 --> 00:40:25,625
It doesn't allow for the idea
that a single worker

603
00:40:25,709 --> 00:40:28,291
may be a whole
and meaningful being.

604
00:40:28,375 --> 00:40:30,125
Mrs. Amalia True. Miss Adair.

605
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:32,291
May I introduce Lord Massen?

606
00:40:32,375 --> 00:40:35,792
- Mrs. True runs The Orphanage.
- Indeed.

607
00:40:35,875 --> 00:40:37,500
Which one's the ugly one?

608
00:40:37,583 --> 00:40:39,792
I take it then that
you are yourselves

609
00:40:39,875 --> 00:40:41,041
among the afflicted?

610
00:40:41,125 --> 00:40:44,125
Touched, yes.
We don't consider
ourselves afflicted.

611
00:40:44,208 --> 00:40:46,166
Perhaps some women
are more fortunate

612
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:48,500
in the nature
of their ailment
than others.

613
00:40:48,583 --> 00:40:50,208
That's true, but,

614
00:40:50,291 --> 00:40:52,500
more suffer from
society's perception

615
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:54,125
than their own debilitation.

616
00:40:54,208 --> 00:40:55,709
Well, so what's wrong with you?

617
00:40:57,709 --> 00:41:00,417
I, I think he means me.

618
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:03,709
- Uh, where to begin...
- No, it's just, you,
you lo... you, you look...

619
00:41:03,792 --> 00:41:05,500
You're qu... You're quite nice.

620
00:41:05,583 --> 00:41:09,542
And you, um,
y-you have the charity,
The Orphanage.

621
00:41:09,625 --> 00:41:12,667
That seems... normal.

622
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:14,375
Miss Bidlow runs The Orphanage.

623
00:41:14,458 --> 00:41:15,959
We're just the employed.

624
00:41:16,041 --> 00:41:19,542
Shockingly,
I'd say my brother
has spoken for everyone.

625
00:41:19,625 --> 00:41:22,083
They're anxious to know
what your "turns" are.

626
00:41:22,166 --> 00:41:25,792
- A "turn" is a trick.
- It's not a trick.

627
00:41:25,875 --> 00:41:28,208
Penance is an inventor.
A creator, really.

628
00:41:28,291 --> 00:41:30,834
Oh. There's only one Creator.

629
00:41:30,917 --> 00:41:33,709
No, uh, I can see energy.

630
00:41:33,792 --> 00:41:36,250
Potential energy.
Like with electricity.

631
00:41:36,333 --> 00:41:38,500
I can see where
it wants to go, or,

632
00:41:38,583 --> 00:41:39,959
move, or settle.

633
00:41:40,041 --> 00:41:42,625
It helps me put things together.

634
00:41:42,709 --> 00:41:44,166
And yours?

635
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:47,291
Mrs. True tends to be
a few steps ahead of
the rest of us.

636
00:41:47,375 --> 00:41:49,875
Mmm. A prognosticator.

637
00:41:49,959 --> 00:41:51,375
Nothing so grand.

638
00:41:51,458 --> 00:41:52,935
So I shouldn't ask
how I'm going to die.

639
00:41:52,959 --> 00:41:56,542
No, but one can safely assume
it will involve a French word.

640
00:41:56,625 --> 00:41:58,625
Ha!

641
00:41:58,709 --> 00:42:01,375
- You see the future?
- Snippets.

642
00:42:01,458 --> 00:42:03,834
It's as confusing
as it is useful.

643
00:42:03,917 --> 00:42:05,291
You were a soldier.

644
00:42:05,375 --> 00:42:08,208
You've seen men who suddenly
feel themselves back in battle.

645
00:42:08,291 --> 00:42:10,166
Well, sometimes I go forward.

646
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:12,041
I never said I was a soldier.

647
00:42:12,125 --> 00:42:15,041
- You're probably going to.
- No, it's the eyes.

648
00:42:15,125 --> 00:42:16,875
Assessing every threat.

649
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:19,041
Lord Massen is
the last line of defense

650
00:42:19,125 --> 00:42:22,041
- against the scourge
of modernity.

651
00:42:22,125 --> 00:42:24,417
I'm old and I've seen
too much change

652
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:27,041
to fight against the tide,
but, uh,

653
00:42:27,125 --> 00:42:29,667
chaos is not change.

654
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:33,875
Shouting for recognition
does not make a people
worthy of it.

655
00:42:33,959 --> 00:42:37,709
There's a harmony to our world
that's worth preserving.

656
00:42:37,792 --> 00:42:39,083
As I understand it,

657
00:42:39,166 --> 00:42:41,208
a harmony is made up
of different voices

658
00:42:41,291 --> 00:42:42,417
sounding different notes.

659
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:46,458
Yes. And one is always
above the other.

660
00:42:46,542 --> 00:42:47,625
Ladies.

661
00:44:18,250 --> 00:44:19,750
I killed the devil.

662
00:44:19,834 --> 00:44:21,184
It's Maladie!

663
00:44:21,208 --> 00:44:24,583
It is Maladie!

664
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:28,417
What does she want?

665
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:31,250
Is no one going to say
"thank you"?

666
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:37,667
It's okay. It's okay.

667
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:39,125
It's okay.

668
00:44:40,792 --> 00:44:43,291
- It's okay, petal.
It's not your fault.

669
00:44:43,375 --> 00:44:45,625
It's the doctor.

670
00:44:46,792 --> 00:44:49,875
Oh! Oh, there's so many people.

671
00:44:52,417 --> 00:44:54,458
Did you all come in hats?

672
00:44:56,417 --> 00:45:00,041
Now all of your brains
are naked. No?

673
00:45:00,125 --> 00:45:03,208
You shall have a wreath

674
00:45:03,291 --> 00:45:04,792
of eels

675
00:45:04,875 --> 00:45:08,333
with the tail in your mouth.

676
00:45:08,417 --> 00:45:10,667
Please!

677
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:12,500
Please.

678
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:17,834
Don't... go.

679
00:45:28,625 --> 00:45:32,959
Devil's speciality is eels.

680
00:45:33,041 --> 00:45:36,250
- Which is known by you
as a serpent.

681
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:38,667
Oh, but it's only Adam.

682
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:41,667
It's all the same
when it slithers.

683
00:45:46,333 --> 00:45:48,542
Eve had a cunt.

684
00:45:57,917 --> 00:45:59,917
Why am I here?

685
00:46:02,875 --> 00:46:06,166
I came to kill an angel witch.

686
00:46:06,875 --> 00:46:08,834
Oops.

687
00:46:08,917 --> 00:46:11,625
But the closer I came,

688
00:46:11,709 --> 00:46:14,542
the more I felt

689
00:46:14,625 --> 00:46:18,959
I was here for a r...

690
00:46:19,041 --> 00:46:23,208
Because I... saw God.

691
00:46:23,917 --> 00:46:25,750
He was all light.

692
00:46:25,834 --> 00:46:29,667
And He put on me His wreath.
He came.

693
00:46:29,750 --> 00:46:31,417
He came to us all,

694
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:35,417
and you all turned
your backs on Him.

695
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:39,250
You lied. You said He never.

696
00:46:39,333 --> 00:46:41,083
But He makes hum.

697
00:46:41,166 --> 00:46:44,834
Oh, He sings.

698
00:46:44,917 --> 00:46:47,250
I could never make it out,

699
00:46:47,333 --> 00:46:52,875
but I feel His hum,
like a comb in my throat.

700
00:46:52,959 --> 00:46:55,917
And I feel it.

701
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,125
I feel it.

702
00:46:58,834 --> 00:47:01,750
Him. Here.

703
00:47:03,083 --> 00:47:06,583
Who... Who...

704
00:47:08,208 --> 00:47:09,917
Ah, bugger it. Take the angel.

705
00:47:18,625 --> 00:47:22,041
Oh, nothing?

706
00:47:22,125 --> 00:47:25,709
Anyone? Tell me what you want!

707
00:47:25,792 --> 00:47:28,166
Either I am here for a reason,

708
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:29,875
or for a bonfire.

709
00:48:55,709 --> 00:48:58,458
Oh, no! She fell!

710
00:49:02,375 --> 00:49:03,875
Aah!

711
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:11,375
Mice. Tiny mice.

712
00:49:22,917 --> 00:49:25,625
How is that still hard?

713
00:49:41,792 --> 00:49:43,166
- Go.
- Damn it.

714
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:44,834
Come on, don't stop.

715
00:49:57,250 --> 00:49:58,792
La!

716
00:49:58,875 --> 00:50:01,166
Just let me have the girl.

717
00:50:01,250 --> 00:50:03,291
Just let me have the girl...

718
00:50:08,625 --> 00:50:10,291
No.

719
00:50:29,417 --> 00:50:31,625
Well, you've made a mess,
little songbird.

720
00:50:42,709 --> 00:50:44,500
Aah!

721
00:50:46,083 --> 00:50:47,208
Boss...

722
00:50:47,291 --> 00:50:48,583
Huh?

723
00:50:48,667 --> 00:50:49,959
Oh.

724
00:51:17,041 --> 00:51:18,959
Hugo Swann.

725
00:51:19,041 --> 00:51:20,417
Lord Swann.

726
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:24,250
- But I'll overlook
the breach this once.

727
00:51:24,333 --> 00:51:27,500
I'm sure this must be
a very difficult time for you.

728
00:51:27,583 --> 00:51:29,000
On the contrary.

729
00:51:29,083 --> 00:51:32,000
London's deadliest maniac
was as close to me
as Kitty is now.

730
00:51:32,083 --> 00:51:34,500
-It's Katie.
-And the presence
of sudden death

731
00:51:34,583 --> 00:51:38,083
makes one appreciate
the act of living.

732
00:51:38,166 --> 00:51:40,166
He did seem to appreciate it.

733
00:51:40,250 --> 00:51:42,917
I'll need to interview
his lordship alone, Katie.

734
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,709
- I don't see why...
- It'll be quicker.

735
00:51:50,667 --> 00:51:52,709
But don't leave the theater,
please.

736
00:51:52,792 --> 00:51:56,542
Oh, I could never
leave the theater...

737
00:51:58,750 --> 00:52:00,834
So I don't suppose
you made any effort

738
00:52:00,917 --> 00:52:03,291
to stop Maladie.

739
00:52:03,375 --> 00:52:07,542
I have it that that's...
your job.

740
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:10,834
Oh, and that there's
a young widow
doing it for you.

741
00:52:11,542 --> 00:52:13,291
Amalia True.

742
00:52:13,375 --> 00:52:16,625
Guest of Lavinia Bidlow.
Runs The Orphanage.

743
00:52:16,709 --> 00:52:19,667
Maladie kidnapped a girl.
Mrs. True gave chase.

744
00:52:19,750 --> 00:52:21,125
Champion of the unfortunate,

745
00:52:21,208 --> 00:52:22,667
and she knocks
dangerous men about.

746
00:52:22,750 --> 00:52:25,500
Then I guess you're lucky
she don't know what
you're up to.

747
00:52:25,583 --> 00:52:28,291
What we're up to.

748
00:52:28,375 --> 00:52:31,333
I think of you as a partner,
in a way.

749
00:52:31,417 --> 00:52:33,333
I don't profit by what we do.

750
00:52:33,417 --> 00:52:35,667
Well, neither do I.

751
00:52:35,750 --> 00:52:37,083
Yet.

752
00:52:37,166 --> 00:52:39,583
Once you've sent enough
suitable girls my way,

753
00:52:39,667 --> 00:52:42,542
and a certain investor
is invested,

754
00:52:42,625 --> 00:52:44,166
The Ferryman's Club will become

755
00:52:44,250 --> 00:52:47,041
not just a profitable business,

756
00:52:47,125 --> 00:52:49,125
but a phenomenon.

757
00:52:49,208 --> 00:52:51,625
I might even forget a few debts.

758
00:52:55,583 --> 00:52:58,083
Take the fucking champagne,
Frank.

759
00:53:02,667 --> 00:53:04,208
You'll want it.

760
00:53:04,291 --> 00:53:08,458
You see, I know the name
of the girl Maladie took.

761
00:53:09,792 --> 00:53:11,625
And so do you.

762
00:53:22,125 --> 00:53:25,875
One little polyglot.

763
00:53:25,959 --> 00:53:29,208
One tiny Touched girl.

764
00:53:29,291 --> 00:53:31,291
That's all you had to bring me.

765
00:53:32,417 --> 00:53:35,375
I like that word. "Touched."

766
00:53:35,458 --> 00:53:39,375
Like the finger of God
gave a few of us a little poke.

767
00:53:39,458 --> 00:53:41,417
Woke us up.

768
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:45,083
Every subject gets me closer
to finding exactly

769
00:53:45,166 --> 00:53:47,333
where it is He touched us.

770
00:53:48,333 --> 00:53:50,000
Oh!

771
00:53:50,083 --> 00:53:51,834
Not today, though.

772
00:53:51,917 --> 00:53:55,250
Mmm. No. Today...

773
00:53:55,333 --> 00:53:58,875
let's just see where it hurts.

774
00:54:06,166 --> 00:54:07,750
Stop him, George!

775
00:54:07,834 --> 00:54:10,166
He's got it in
his jacket pocket!

776
00:54:20,750 --> 00:54:22,667
We didn't want it anyway!

777
00:54:22,750 --> 00:54:24,333
Fucking tart!

778
00:54:26,542 --> 00:54:28,959
Oi.
Is that maniac
a friend of yours?

779
00:54:37,792 --> 00:54:39,250
Amalia?

780
00:54:45,959 --> 00:54:47,291
Mrs. True?

781
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:55,000
Miss Adair.

782
00:54:57,208 --> 00:54:59,375
You look very fine.

783
00:55:04,792 --> 00:55:06,709
Got into a fight.

784
00:55:08,458 --> 00:55:10,750
It's been a day for that.

785
00:55:14,125 --> 00:55:15,792
I didn't win.

786
00:55:15,875 --> 00:55:18,000
Maladie has the girl.

787
00:55:18,083 --> 00:55:21,709
Mary. Brighton, they said.

788
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,041
She won't kill her.

789
00:55:28,125 --> 00:55:30,375
Not right away. We have time.

790
00:55:30,458 --> 00:55:32,834
We... have some time.

791
00:55:34,166 --> 00:55:37,834
And you've found
an invigorating way
to spend it.

792
00:55:37,917 --> 00:55:40,000
- They started it.
- Mmm.

793
00:55:40,083 --> 00:55:41,291
Not...

794
00:55:41,375 --> 00:55:43,917
- No, I started it.
- I know.

795
00:55:45,542 --> 00:55:49,834
I know. Trouble
makes you troublesome.

796
00:55:49,917 --> 00:55:53,166
But nothing sets you off
like good fortune.

797
00:55:55,125 --> 00:55:56,750
Mary's song.

798
00:56:01,959 --> 00:56:04,417
Reachin' right into me.

799
00:56:06,166 --> 00:56:09,083
Tellin' me that...

800
00:56:09,166 --> 00:56:10,792
that I'm here.

801
00:56:12,625 --> 00:56:14,417
I belong here.

802
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:17,333
And you.

803
00:56:17,417 --> 00:56:22,083
And... all of us that's Touched.

804
00:56:24,083 --> 00:56:26,291
We're woven into
the fabric of the world,

805
00:56:26,375 --> 00:56:29,208
and we're meant to be as we are.

806
00:56:33,417 --> 00:56:36,917
We find Mary.
We get her singin'.

807
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,166
They'll all come to us,
and they'll be safe.

808
00:56:44,917 --> 00:56:46,792
They won't be safe.

809
00:56:51,417 --> 00:56:53,333
Less lonely, then.

810
00:56:53,417 --> 00:56:55,291
And that's a start.

811
00:56:59,542 --> 00:57:01,333
It's a start.

812
01:03:27,375 --> 01:03:28,667
Are you Amalia True?

813
01:03:28,750 --> 01:03:29,959
Have you got information?

814
01:03:30,750 --> 01:03:31,750
You're Mary Brighton.

815
01:03:32,125 --> 01:03:33,625
Is Mary touched like you?

816
01:03:34,250 --> 01:03:35,970
I see things that aren't there,

817
01:03:36,458 --> 01:03:37,917
I drink when I shouldn't...

818
01:03:39,291 --> 01:03:41,417
and I've had more
experience with violence

819
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:42,583
than I would've liked.

820
01:03:45,959 --> 01:03:48,583
I can assure you she is nothing
like me, she's wonderful.

821
01:03:48,667 --> 01:03:50,208
How are you not wonderful?

822
01:03:53,458 --> 01:03:55,291
There's been a massacre.

823
01:03:57,583 --> 01:04:00,208
Maladie's defiance
is at a fever pitch.

824
01:04:01,750 --> 01:04:02,750
Are you afraid?

825
01:04:04,792 --> 01:04:06,312
The Touched are the future.

826
01:04:06,458 --> 01:04:08,125
Particularly, our future.

827
01:04:09,792 --> 01:04:12,291
We're being attacked,
and it's getting worse.

828
01:04:13,291 --> 01:04:15,792
The Touched are not here
to be slaughtered for show.

829
01:04:16,959 --> 01:04:18,601
And if we have the power
to stop it,

830
01:04:18,625 --> 01:04:20,667
then that is the reason
that we have power at all.

831
01:04:21,875 --> 01:04:23,315
They are not special.

832
01:04:23,959 --> 01:04:25,083
They are not a community.

833
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:28,625
If London is going to be
saved from chaos...

834
01:04:31,041 --> 01:04:32,834
it needs to see chaos.

835
01:04:37,166 --> 01:04:39,542
♪ London calling
To the faraway town ♪

836
01:04:39,959 --> 01:04:41,000
♪ Now war is declared... ♪

837
01:04:41,083 --> 01:04:42,125
Amalia True?

838
01:04:42,792 --> 01:04:44,017
I do not believe
she has any interest

839
01:04:44,041 --> 01:04:45,542
in giving the Touched
a safe haven.

840
01:04:47,166 --> 01:04:48,166
Blood.

841
01:04:49,125 --> 01:04:50,500
That ain't her whole story.

842
01:04:50,875 --> 01:04:51,959
I do have a mission.

843
01:04:52,709 --> 01:04:54,750
The future of the world
depends on what I'm doing.

844
01:05:06,667 --> 01:05:08,166
You said you had a mission!

845
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:10,333
Well God gave me a mission, too.

846
01:05:12,041 --> 01:05:16,000
♪ And I Live by the river ♪

847
01:05:16,417 --> 01:05:17,792
It's time to tell them.

848
01:05:18,834 --> 01:05:19,834
Everything.

849
01:05:29,625 --> 01:05:31,959
Miss True! You look very fine.

850
01:05:32,041 --> 01:05:33,291
I think so, too.

851
01:05:33,375 --> 01:05:35,083
So, Amalia,
before she goes to the opera,

852
01:05:35,166 --> 01:05:36,917
has a rippling that tells her

853
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,125
that she thinks
she's going to be needed there.

854
01:05:39,792 --> 01:05:41,685
Are you sure
we need to go to this?

855
01:05:41,709 --> 01:05:44,709
Yes. Wish I knew why.

856
01:05:47,959 --> 01:05:52,125
The opera
is a huge event in society,

857
01:05:52,208 --> 01:05:54,248
and it's the first time
that a lot of our characters

858
01:05:54,291 --> 01:05:55,542
are going to meet each other.

859
01:05:55,834 --> 01:05:58,792
Lavinia
is trying to, sort of, display

860
01:05:58,875 --> 01:06:02,500
her best subjects
from the Touched,

861
01:06:02,583 --> 01:06:06,125
and show that
they are socially acceptable.

862
01:06:06,208 --> 01:06:08,458
She invites her
very conventional

863
01:06:08,542 --> 01:06:12,125
and slightly sinister friend,
Lord Massen, along to show off

864
01:06:12,208 --> 01:06:15,000
how brilliant her...
Her young subjects are.

865
01:06:15,083 --> 01:06:17,375
I take it, then,
that you are yourselves

866
01:06:17,458 --> 01:06:18,458
among the afflicted.

867
01:06:18,709 --> 01:06:21,625
Touched, yes. We don't consider
ourselves "afflicted."

868
01:06:22,208 --> 01:06:23,434
There's a power play

869
01:06:23,458 --> 01:06:25,667
between Massen and Amalia.

870
01:06:25,750 --> 01:06:28,959
He's the old power. I guess
she represents the new power.

871
01:06:29,041 --> 01:06:32,667
And neither one of them
is gonna give that up easily.

872
01:06:32,750 --> 01:06:34,750
For him, the way things are

873
01:06:34,834 --> 01:06:36,917
should be a very
patriarchal model,

874
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,000
as it was before.

875
01:06:38,333 --> 01:06:40,309
And the real problem is that
these women who are Touched

876
01:06:40,333 --> 01:06:43,834
around London represent
something very unsettling

877
01:06:43,917 --> 01:06:44,917
to the social model.

878
01:06:45,208 --> 01:06:49,000
There's a harmony to our world
that's worth preserving.

879
01:06:49,083 --> 01:06:51,250
As I understand it,
a harmony is made up

880
01:06:51,333 --> 01:06:53,542
of different voices
sounding different notes.

881
01:06:53,625 --> 01:06:56,750
Yes. And one is always
above the other.

882
01:06:57,875 --> 01:06:58,955
Cut there please.

883
01:06:59,542 --> 01:07:01,559
Straight away again please,
guys. First positions.

884
01:07:01,583 --> 01:07:03,709
The things that
stands out about the week

885
01:07:03,792 --> 01:07:05,333
that we were filming
at the opera,

886
01:07:05,417 --> 01:07:07,583
was the heat
that we were filming in.

887
01:07:07,667 --> 01:07:09,643
We were filming
in Wimbledon Theatre,

888
01:07:09,667 --> 01:07:12,125
which is just the kind
of perfect space for it.

889
01:07:12,208 --> 01:07:14,333
It's a gorgeous,
gorgeous theatre.

890
01:07:14,625 --> 01:07:17,458
And, uh... And in amongst that,
we had this, um...

891
01:07:17,750 --> 01:07:20,792
these opera singers,
who were just absolutely
fabulous.

892
01:07:21,125 --> 01:07:23,917
The kind of camaraderie
that comes from being

893
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:28,792
in woollen tuxedos in, uh,
inside an ancient building

894
01:07:28,875 --> 01:07:31,250
in, like, 95,
hundred-degree heat

895
01:07:31,333 --> 01:07:34,166
is um... is... is special.

896
01:07:34,250 --> 01:07:37,417
And in a weird way, I think
that helped the scene,

897
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:40,667
because it was uncomfortable,
and strange...

898
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,291
I killed a devil.

899
01:07:49,625 --> 01:07:53,625
Maladie is a force
of wonderful chaos.

900
01:07:53,709 --> 01:07:55,417
She comes out
on that opera stage,

901
01:07:55,500 --> 01:07:59,875
and she is enraged,
she is vengeful.

902
01:08:00,208 --> 01:08:01,875
Did you all come in hats?

903
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:07,583
Now all of your brains
are naked. No.

904
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:11,333
"Maladie"
means "disease" in French.

905
01:08:12,959 --> 01:08:15,083
I don't think she intends
to go there to kill

906
01:08:15,291 --> 01:08:16,834
the elite of society en masse,

907
01:08:16,917 --> 01:08:18,792
but that's what
ends up happening.

908
01:08:20,208 --> 01:08:22,500
She's somebody that
I want to hug all the time.

909
01:08:22,583 --> 01:08:25,166
You know, because people
aren't born that vindictive,

910
01:08:25,250 --> 01:08:26,959
or as a terrorist.

911
01:08:27,041 --> 01:08:29,125
They become it
because of something

912
01:08:29,208 --> 01:08:30,125
within their past,

913
01:08:30,208 --> 01:08:32,542
and that's what
resonated with me.

914
01:08:32,959 --> 01:08:35,333
The opera scene
was my first experience

915
01:08:35,417 --> 01:08:39,041
of Amy playing Maladie,
and it was incredible to see

916
01:08:39,125 --> 01:08:41,083
what she was bringing
out of that character,

917
01:08:41,166 --> 01:08:44,375
and how she was able to perform,
literally, on that stage.

918
01:08:44,875 --> 01:08:47,583
As an actress,
you dream of a role like this.

919
01:08:48,291 --> 01:08:50,834
That's no mean feat,
playing Maladie.

920
01:08:51,208 --> 01:08:53,625
I went back to what we used
to do at drama school,

921
01:08:53,709 --> 01:08:55,417
so the words come last.

922
01:08:56,417 --> 01:08:59,834
It's all about who she is,
and what she feels,

923
01:08:59,917 --> 01:09:00,834
what's her trigger,

924
01:09:00,917 --> 01:09:03,458
and what it feels like
to be lonely,

925
01:09:03,542 --> 01:09:05,583
to be this solitary existence.

926
01:09:06,417 --> 01:09:09,500
It's taken me down some, uh,
some random paths,

927
01:09:09,583 --> 01:09:11,500
the research that
I go into, actually,

928
01:09:11,583 --> 01:09:14,834
and some, yeah,
really squirmish places
that I get to.

929
01:09:15,083 --> 01:09:16,417
Why am I here?

930
01:09:16,792 --> 01:09:18,792
Maladie's got this constant war

931
01:09:18,875 --> 01:09:19,875
with herself.

932
01:09:20,417 --> 01:09:23,959
It's very hard when you're doing
somebody that is that damaged.

933
01:09:24,166 --> 01:09:25,875
We did so many
different looks on her.

934
01:09:25,959 --> 01:09:28,500
We went to the absolute extreme,
where we are just, kind of,

935
01:09:28,583 --> 01:09:31,709
almost doing comedy joker stuff,
and then we pulled it back.

936
01:09:32,125 --> 01:09:35,250
The inspiration almost come
from modern-day punk.

937
01:09:35,417 --> 01:09:38,041
Her hair is really messed up,
do you know what I mean?

938
01:09:38,125 --> 01:09:40,250
And when she puts on
her makeup, we literally go...

939
01:09:41,083 --> 01:09:43,625
There we go.

940
01:09:44,792 --> 01:09:46,250
Every time I got in her garb,

941
01:09:46,333 --> 01:09:48,709
there was like a flick
of a switch that just

942
01:09:48,792 --> 01:09:52,083
went off in my mind, uh,
each time.

943
01:09:53,542 --> 01:09:56,291
Either I am here for a reason,

944
01:09:56,667 --> 01:09:58,417
or for a bonfire.

945
01:10:10,208 --> 01:10:12,226
- Stand by.
- Be quiet now.

946
01:10:13,709 --> 01:10:15,709
The opera scene was...
Was a lot of fun.

947
01:10:15,792 --> 01:10:17,875
It's one of the first things
that we actually shot.

948
01:10:17,959 --> 01:10:21,583
So, to be, sort of, finding
the character, you know,

949
01:10:21,667 --> 01:10:24,709
straight off in... in a scene
that's that important was...

950
01:10:24,792 --> 01:10:26,375
Was quite intense.

951
01:10:28,041 --> 01:10:31,500
We had these great big, um, rigs
of blue light

952
01:10:31,583 --> 01:10:36,250
that, sort of, went around me
and changed as we shot it.

953
01:10:36,583 --> 01:10:38,709
And it's visually
kind of arresting

954
01:10:38,792 --> 01:10:41,000
and haunting at the same time.

955
01:10:44,125 --> 01:10:45,709
We used a light effect

956
01:10:45,792 --> 01:10:49,250
that's not really meant
to... to symbolize an actual

957
01:10:49,333 --> 01:10:51,583
visible light that everyone
in the room saw.

958
01:10:51,792 --> 01:10:55,291
It's sort of,
"Here's what it feels like,"

959
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:59,000
and you can see who's Touched
and who's not.

960
01:10:59,083 --> 01:11:00,875
And certain people
are off camera

961
01:11:00,959 --> 01:11:03,333
and you don't know
whether there's a light on them

962
01:11:03,417 --> 01:11:05,542
or not, they're purposely kept
ambiguous.

963
01:11:05,875 --> 01:11:08,959
But we saw, for example,
that Augie is Touched,

964
01:11:09,041 --> 01:11:11,333
which is, uh, a... a reveal.

965
01:11:12,208 --> 01:11:14,792
I don't think Augie's got
any idea that he's Touched

966
01:11:14,875 --> 01:11:16,166
prior to that moment.

967
01:11:16,375 --> 01:11:18,792
That partly comes from
the fact that he belongs

968
01:11:18,875 --> 01:11:21,083
to a social class
where he doesn't believe

969
01:11:21,166 --> 01:11:23,834
this is something that affects
people like him.

970
01:11:24,291 --> 01:11:25,768
It feels like all your pain

971
01:11:25,792 --> 01:11:28,333
is just melted away and then
you're just left with this,

972
01:11:28,583 --> 01:11:33,375
like, very present feeling
that Penance gets to share
with Augie.

973
01:11:33,709 --> 01:11:35,709
I think she's the only one
who sees this

974
01:11:35,792 --> 01:11:37,667
and understands it
and realizes it.

975
01:11:38,250 --> 01:11:42,333
It hits Amalia somewhere deep
in her soul

976
01:11:42,417 --> 01:11:48,333
that this means something
very unique and special

977
01:11:48,667 --> 01:11:50,417
for The Touched. She knows that,

978
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:52,834
kind of, Mary
is the way forward with this.

979
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:55,667
Maladie thought
that she was the chosen one,

980
01:11:55,750 --> 01:11:58,291
she was the special one,
but Mary's got this bigger power

981
01:11:58,375 --> 01:12:02,250
over more people and queries,
"Hang on a second, I thought
it was just me."

982
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:04,542
So that's why she chooses
to kidnap Mary,

983
01:12:04,625 --> 01:12:06,667
and just to gain
more information.

984
01:12:06,750 --> 01:12:10,542
There's more going on
than what Maladie
first understood.

985
01:12:12,750 --> 01:12:18,250
Mary is the key person
that we didn't even know

986
01:12:18,333 --> 01:12:19,709
that we had to find.

987
01:12:19,792 --> 01:12:21,083
Just let me have the girl.

988
01:12:21,166 --> 01:12:23,250
Just let me have the girl...

989
01:12:23,917 --> 01:12:24,959
No.

990
01:12:25,458 --> 01:12:29,458
And that sets off,
like, a massive chain of events.
