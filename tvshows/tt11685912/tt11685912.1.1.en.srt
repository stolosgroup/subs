- Nope.

163

What are you, then?

164
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:01,208
I'm a poet.

165
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:03,250
- You're a poet?
- Yeah, I'm a poet.

166
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:05,750
Well, we're not
in the market for poems.

167
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:07,916
Oh, good, I'm not selling any.

168

What are you here for, then?

169

Peace, enlightenment,

170

Just kidding. I'm kidding.

171
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:19,017
I'm just looking
for a good place to camp,

172
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:20,291
to be honest, you know.

173
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:21,958
I'll only be a few days.

174
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:25,291
Yeah, we're not a tourist ranch.
We're a cattle ranch.

175
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:27,625
I know.

176
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:32,291
I can pay you.

177
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:34,916
Here, just take it.
I know you need it.

178
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,041
How do you know that?

179
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:39,625
I mean, come on,
you're a family ranch...

180

What do you say? Come on,
I'm just looking to camp.

181
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:53,125
Okay.

182
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:56,541
Can camp out
on the west pasture.

183
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:59,041
Follow the fence
with the red markers.

184
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:01,458
There's a spigot in the stables
if you want some water.

185
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:03,000
Oh, my God, thank you, sir.

Yeah, Royal. It's just Royal.

Fine, thanks.
Just wanted to come by and...

Came knocking on your door.
Cecilia said you lost a few?

Well, we felt it best to break
this to you in person, but...

State says you're nearly a mile

Water rights? Drilling?

Ah, it's just business,

There's nothing

No, I'll take care of it.

any chance she left on her own.

00:43:14,625 --> 00:43:17,125
a single goddamn word,
you got it?

484
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:25,541
<i>Look, there ain't
a clean way around this.</i>

485
00:43:25,625 --> 00:43:27,000
<i>Your brother's been
through enough.</i>

486
00:43:27,083 --> 00:43:29,833
<i>There's not a chance in hell I'm
letting Amy lose her dad, too.</i>

487
00:43:29,916 --> 00:43:31,500
You agree?

488
00:43:31,583 --> 00:43:33,250
Sure. But what's that mean
for me?

489
00:43:33,333 --> 00:43:34,559
I'm just supposed
to go down by myself?

490
00:43:34,583 --> 00:43:36,916
I'm not losing either of you,
all right?

491
00:43:40,291 --> 00:43:42,958
So what are we gonna do?

492
00:43:44,083 --> 00:43:47,083
<i>I want you
to burn the shirts,</i>

493
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:49,041
<i>clean out the truck.</i>

494
00:43:52,166 --> 00:43:53,791
<i>Leave the body to me.</i>

495
00:43:53,875 --> 00:43:57,083
<i>What are you gonna
do with it?</i>

496
00:43:57,166 --> 00:43:59,666
<i>Just wait in the stables
till I get back. Got it?</i>

497
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:00,976
<i>When I come back,
we'll never say</i>

498
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,291
<i>another word about it.</i>

499
00:44:05,583 --> 00:44:07,916
Hey, you seen Trevor?

500
00:45:05,041 --> 00:45:06,666
What's that?

501
00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:08,666
Go back to sleep.

502
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:11,166
- Who is it?
- Shh.

503
00:45:36,375 --> 00:45:38,791
Hey, what's up?
What's going on?

504
00:45:38,875 --> 00:45:40,375
Your brother home?

505
00:45:40,458 --> 00:45:43,041
- Why?
- Y'all get in recently?

506
00:45:43,125 --> 00:45:47,333
Um, I got back, like,
an hour ago maybe.

507
00:45:47,416 --> 00:45:49,208
Why? What's wrong?

508
00:45:49,291 --> 00:45:51,416
Hi, Amy.

509
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:54,083
Go back to bed, honey.

510
00:45:54,166 --> 00:45:56,416
I need water.

511
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:58,833
Where's Rhett?

512
00:46:06,583 --> 00:46:09,375
Can we come inside?

513
00:46:09,458 --> 00:46:12,208
- No, I don't think so.
- Let me ask again, then.

514
00:46:12,291 --> 00:46:15,416
Where's Rhett?

515
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:16,708
He's not in here.

516
00:46:16,791 --> 00:46:19,000
Well, where is he, then?

517
00:46:19,083 --> 00:46:20,583
I don't know.

518
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:24,291
His truck isn't in the driveway.

519
00:46:26,666 --> 00:46:29,333
Yeah. I don't know, then.

520
00:46:29,416 --> 00:46:32,500
You seen Trevor around?

521
00:46:32,583 --> 00:46:34,625
Not since the bar, no.

522
00:46:42,166 --> 00:46:44,750
Dad, I'm thirsty.

523
00:46:44,833 --> 00:46:46,500
Hold on, sweetie.

524
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,375
Hey, whoa. Whoa!

525
00:46:49,458 --> 00:46:51,750
You are not coming in here.

526
00:46:54,208 --> 00:46:55,750
What happened to your hand?

527
00:46:57,333 --> 00:46:59,041
Horse stepped on it.

528
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:04,041
All right, would you
come outside with us?

529
00:47:04,125 --> 00:47:06,041
Just have a look.

530
00:47:06,125 --> 00:47:10,250
Dad, water. Please?

531
00:47:47,250 --> 00:47:48,875
- Hey.
- Hey.

532
00:47:48,958 --> 00:47:51,125
Mom, would you put her
back to bed for me?

533
00:47:51,208 --> 00:47:52,833
- I gotta...
- Who's at the door?

534
00:47:52,916 --> 00:47:54,333
Never mind that.
I got it.

535
00:47:54,416 --> 00:47:57,541
Honey, Grandma's gonna
put you back to bed.

536
00:47:57,625 --> 00:47:59,583
I'm just gonna go outside
for a minute, okay?

537
00:47:59,666 --> 00:48:02,416
- Okay.
- Okay.

538
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:04,416
Come on.

539
00:48:06,791 --> 00:48:09,333
Luke, it's 1:00 in the morning.

540
00:48:12,708 --> 00:48:15,208
Look, I don't know what
you're hoping to find out here.

541
00:48:22,416 --> 00:48:24,000
Luke, come on.

542
00:48:26,875 --> 00:48:29,142
- Can you open these up?
- Why? What is it you...

543
00:48:29,166 --> 00:48:31,125
Just open
the damn doors, Perry.

544
00:48:31,208 --> 00:48:33,125
If Rhett's in there,
he's trashed.

545
00:48:33,208 --> 00:48:35,333
I'll tell you that.

546
00:48:42,708 --> 00:48:44,291
Gotta go back to the house

547
00:48:44,375 --> 00:48:46,455
and get the keys
for the other side.

548
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:49,500
No.

549
00:48:50,833 --> 00:48:53,375
I think we're getting in
right now.

550
00:49:00,875 --> 00:49:03,583
Guys! Knock it off!

551
00:49:18,041 --> 00:49:21,500
Luke, might want
to have a look at this.

552
00:49:27,666 --> 00:49:29,458
Looks like somebody's
out riding.

553
00:49:29,541 --> 00:49:30,791
What? No, you idiot.

554
00:49:30,875 --> 00:49:32,875
That's obviously from earlier.

555
00:49:34,750 --> 00:49:37,375
Seems pretty fresh to me.

556
00:50:16,250 --> 00:50:18,000
Tillie! Tillie!

557
00:52:21,666 --> 00:52:24,708
What is this, Royal?

558
00:52:30,208 --> 00:52:33,250
I don't...
I don't know what it is.

559
00:52:35,333 --> 00:52:37,208
Well, you must know something.

560
00:52:37,291 --> 00:52:39,666
Why else would you throw
a body in there?

561
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:52,500
You know about
the Greek god Chronos?

562
00:52:53,958 --> 00:52:55,375
What?

563
00:52:55,458 --> 00:52:58,375
He's trickled down, you know,

564
00:52:58,458 --> 00:53:01,375
into every civilization.

565
00:53:01,458 --> 00:53:03,541
He's evolved here and there.

566
00:53:03,625 --> 00:53:08,125
He always carried a...
like, a sickle.

567
00:53:10,833 --> 00:53:13,750
- Listen...
- He used that sickle

568
00:53:13,833 --> 00:53:15,708
to cut a hole.

569
00:53:15,791 --> 00:53:19,375
You know, make a tear in the
cosmos between heaven and earth

570
00:53:19,458 --> 00:53:22,708
to separate this world
from the next.

571
00:53:22,791 --> 00:53:27,791
To separate the-the known
from the unknown.

572
00:53:27,875 --> 00:53:31,750
You see,
that's how we got time.

573
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:34,416
Because Chronos is chronology.

574
00:53:40,708 --> 00:53:42,166
Who else knows about this?

575
00:53:48,916 --> 00:53:51,208
No one.

576
00:53:53,166 --> 00:53:54,875
Really?

577
00:53:56,541 --> 00:53:58,375
- Yeah.
- Why?

578
00:54:04,250 --> 00:54:05,875
I won't tell anyone.

579
00:54:07,458 --> 00:54:12,458
Hey, I'm not gonna tell anyone.

580
00:54:12,541 --> 00:54:15,500
This'll be our little secret.

581
00:54:17,666 --> 00:54:18,791
Deal?

582
00:54:23,416 --> 00:54:27,083
The world's been waiting
for something like this.
