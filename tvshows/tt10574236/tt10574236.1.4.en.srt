-== [ www.OpenSubtitles.com ] ==-

2
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:15,098
I remember damage...

3
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:41,624
Then escape.

4
00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:50,132
Then adrift
in a stranger's galaxy

5
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:51,718
for a long time.

6
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:55,722
But I'm safe now.

7
00:00:58,057 --> 00:00:59,184
I found it again...

8
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,528
- My home.
- My home.

9
00:01:25,084 --> 00:01:27,002
It's been a week.

10
00:01:27,086 --> 00:01:29,672
Can you stop worrying
about David?

11
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:33,676
You should be more worried.

12
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,179
He was so sad
about his wife.

13
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:39,390
I wonder what happened to him.

14
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:45,563
What did he say
his wife's name was, again?

15
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:46,522
Rose.

16
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:49,316
By any other name.

17
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,110
There probably was no "Rose."

18
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:52,194
I know that.

19
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,533
Well, so what if people
make up who they are?

20
00:01:57,617 --> 00:02:00,035
It's what you all do
all the time.

21
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:03,497
- All of who? Actors?
- Pre-Pans.

22
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:10,045
What did he say to you
when you were alone with him?

23
00:02:10,129 --> 00:02:11,547
Why do you care so much?

24
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:12,757
Well, I care,

25
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:14,258
because if something happens
to you, it's my fault.

26
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:17,803
The world's still a very
dangerous fucking place, Alex.

27
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:20,890
Cartwheel.

28
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:24,018
Just... don't talk
to strangers!

29
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:29,065
Welcome to the fork
in the road,

30
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:33,569
the beautiful
Petoskey Station!

31
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:35,154
I finished reading it!

32
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:38,407
It's inspired.
Inspired!

33
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:40,075
- Really.
- What is it?

34
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:41,911
Wendy adapted "Hamlet."

35
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,829
Takes place
in Portland, Oregon.

36
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:45,748
Told in the vernacular
of '90s indie rock.

37
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:48,292
- It's wild.
- All right.

38
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:50,002
Circle the wagons.

39
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:51,545
Four watch points.

40
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:53,589
Swap every four hours.

41
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:56,091
That's our route.

42
00:02:56,175 --> 00:03:00,596
Learn to love it, Dan.
We don't go off-wheel.

43
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,224
Why is Pingtree crossed off?

44
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,437
That way's Pingtree.

45
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:11,190
Golf course where a bunch
of professors live now.

46
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:15,528
Gil, our second founding
member, he retired there.

47
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:17,822
And that way's Nuevo Santiago.

48
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:20,491
Whew, they love music.

49
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:21,575
We used to split up
every year.

50
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:24,787
Actors went that way,
and musicians went that way,

51
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:27,790
and we'd rally here afterwards
and all head to Traverse City.

52
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:31,836
So why don't we
do that anymore?

53
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,089
Gil had a second-marriage
thing going on at Pingtree.

54
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:37,132
Some professor named Katrina.

55
00:03:37,216 --> 00:03:40,010
Conductor found out,
like, three years now,

56
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:42,930
and she shot Gil.

57
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:44,557
She killed our director?

58
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:54,567
We don't go to Pingtree.

59
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:05,995
Stranger.

60
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,496
- Stranger.
- Stranger.

61
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,583
Hi! Hello! Hello.

62
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,877
- No danger.
- I finally caught you!

63
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:15,296
No danger.

64
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,424
I'm very much looking forward
to your next performance...

65
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:19,174
tomorrow.

66
00:04:19,258 --> 00:04:23,220
Dieter,
here's a suspicious man

67
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:26,807
I didn't bother to tell you
about from the other day.

68
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:33,355
Perhaps this is
the perfect time

69
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:36,275
to invite you once more

70
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:40,821
into the Museum
of Civilization.

71
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:43,115
To the east.

72
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:47,328
It's only a week away, and
I will personally guide you.

73
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:50,998
Personally guide you.

74
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:53,584
We're fans of yours,
Ms. Larson.

75
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:58,214
I listen to it all the time.

76
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,214
- How?
- Uh...

77
00:04:59,298 --> 00:05:01,884
Well, we will not be coming
to your town,

78
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:05,346
but I will be taking this.

79
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,305
Thank you.

80
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:07,890
I used to be on NPR.

81
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:11,602
Well, um...

82
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:17,691
perhaps I'll... I'll try you
again in Nuevo Santiago.

83
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:19,861
The answer's
still gonna be no!

84
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:25,491
Third... third time is a charm!

85
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:28,494
Remember what you love.

86
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:29,954
We don't leave the wheel.

87
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:43,467
- "Beware the Prophet.
- If you see this man,

88
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,426
"cover your ears
and run for your lives.

89
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:47,054
"Beware the terrible prophet
in these parts

90
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:48,898
and the cult of the children
who follow him."

91
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:53,061
Oh, fuck.

92
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:02,194
That should clear it up.

93
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:03,278
Okay.

94
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:07,950
He asked me
what it was like

95
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:11,453
to be the only Post-Pan
in the troupe.

96
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:13,122
I said I didn't think
about it that way,

97
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,166
but he said that I should...

98
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:23,882
That Post-Pans were special...

99
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:28,053
the first human generation
to be rid from trauma...

100
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:30,431
and that the survivors
were the only liars left.

101
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:35,978
That's what
the Undersea thought.

102
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:39,565
It's from "Station Eleven."

103
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:42,109
- Maybe he read it.
- No.

104
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:45,696
There's only one copy,
and I hid it.

105
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:54,371
Huh.

106
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,918
It's at Pingtree...

107
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:02,964
in Gil's office.

108
00:07:04,423 --> 00:07:07,093
- We should go tonight.
- Just us.

109
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:11,972
Check on Gil and...

110
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:14,517
and make sure everyone's okay.

111
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:24,068
I'll talk to Sarah.

112
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,031
Let's unload.

113
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:38,040
♪ You don't move me ♪

114
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:44,171
♪ Like you did once before ♪

115
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:47,841
♪ Don't care for you anymore ♪

116
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:49,134
- Ready? Are you ready?
- Yeah. Yeah.

117
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:50,594
- Are you ready?
- Go. Yeah, yeah.

118
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:53,013
- Yeah, there you go.
- Oh! Fuck!

119
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:54,640
What's wrong with you?

120
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:57,059
You're so bad at cards.

121
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,603
We should do this more,
though, for real.

122
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:02,981
I mean, it's not like
we have lives or anything.

123
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:05,610
Yeah,
but you've been writing.

124
00:08:07,486 --> 00:08:09,071
Don't attempt
to score "Hamlet."

125
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,823
It will kill you.

126
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:15,870
"The winds of chaos,"
as my mama used to say.

127
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:24,628
I saw you...

128
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:26,380
onstage.

129
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:29,925
Something had you...

130
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:32,303
just for a second.

131
00:08:33,512 --> 00:08:35,556
What happened?

132
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:39,894
Tell me.

133
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:53,782
Is this what you were playing
when I met you?

134
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,659
I was attempting
to play that.

135
00:08:55,743 --> 00:09:01,332
You can't play
"La campanella" on the keytar.

136
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:07,713
That's not the reason
I can't play it.

137
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:12,635
I still fantasize, though...

138
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:21,018
About that harlot being forced
to hear me play it for Gil.

139
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:22,644
- Maybe we should go back.
- No!

140
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:25,940
Fuck her,
and fuck him.

141
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:34,657
I did hear something,
actually, um...

142
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:40,329
At St. Deb's.

143
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,873
I don't know.
It might have been a rumor.

144
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
What?

145
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:50,589
That Katrina died, actually.

146
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:52,341
What? How?

147
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,509
Pneumonia.

148
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:57,012
Although...

149
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:59,598
I don't know.

150
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:01,016
You know what?
It was secondhand.

151
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,562
And I don't know if...

152
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:12,236
Everyone!

153
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,862
Oh, Sarah.

154
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:15,197
Listen up!

155
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,201
We're splitting the troupe.

156
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,536
The actors and I are going
back to Pingtree.

157
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,872
The rest of you,
take the wagons

158
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:24,706
and go on to Nuevo Santiago.

159
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:28,043
We just make up the rules
as we go.

160
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,211
Why?

161
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:43,976
Hey.

162
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,394
Now the road's open,

163
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:48,272
maybe we can
go scavenging again.

164
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:51,442
We don't need anything.

165
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,654
How about a new book?

166
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,323
I like this one.

167
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:00,200
Why, though?

168
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:02,995
Really, I mean,
I played the main guy,

169
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,288
and I still don't even know.

170
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:05,706
Is it actually any good,

171
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,082
or is it just
what was in your backpack?

172
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,210
Read me a line.

173
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:16,550
"To the monsters,
we're the monsters."

174
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:19,637
What does that mean?

175
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,056
You murdered
Big Daddy's entire family.

176
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,434
Murdered?

177
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:28,604
The wolves think you're scary
like you think they're scary.

178
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:37,029
- We're the same.
- Hmm.

179
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:45,996
We're not the same.

180
00:11:57,675 --> 00:12:00,845
- I don't know.
- Everything looks safe.

181
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:15,484
Everything looks normal.

182
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:18,779
Still the fake minefield.
No sign of the Prophet.

183
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:23,700
I should have seen
what he was doing.

184
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:27,162
No, it's hard
to see dangerous people.

185
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:29,581
You knew it, though.

186
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:32,334
Yeah, I knew it,
but I was dangerous

187
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:33,836
when I was little.

188
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,131
And people really
put their guard down

189
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:39,466
when you play vulnerable.

190
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:43,261
I mean, the leg,
the dead wife.

191
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:45,180
What's the situation?

192
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:48,016
We're not sure.

193
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,476
Does that sign say
"minefield"?

194
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,936
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

195
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,814
- There used to be a minefield.
- Yeah.

196
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:54,815
Why are there mines
on a golf course?

197
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:58,068
- Just out of curiosity.
- Oh, back in Year One,

198
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:02,614
- And what are Red Bs?
- Red Bandanas.

199
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:07,035
A bunch of militias
of crystal meth morons.

200
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:09,204
Called them Kevins
back in Virginia.

201
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,957
I thought this place
was all, like, nice people,

202
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,601
college professors
and the old director.

203
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,383
Not all of them.

204
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:22,426
There's still some pockets
in the woods.

205
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:25,095
- Yeah.
- To the east.

206
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:28,098
And you know
Vlad was a Red Bandana, right?

207
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:30,851
Really.
You could ask him.

208
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:32,853
There!

209
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:34,563
- Oh.
- It's Gil.

210
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,398
- Hey!
- Gil!

211
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,066
- Gil!
- Yeah!

212
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,109
- Hey!
- Hey!

213
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:41,028
- Gil!
- Hey!

214
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:47,909
Stop moving!

215
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:50,537
- We put the mines back in.
- What's he saying?

216
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:52,122
Gil, it's us
from the Traveling Symphony!

217
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:54,583
- Stop!
- There's mines!

218
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:57,210
- Who is that?
- It's Katrina.

219
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:59,088
My God, I hate Katrina.

220
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,550
Stop moving!

221
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:06,761
We put the mines back in!

222
00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:08,513
Well, hello to you, too!

223
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:11,433
You're already in the middle
of the minefield!

224
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:14,102
It starts back there
at the fucking green!

225
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:15,770
Oh, my God.

226
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:18,732
You are surrounded!

227
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:20,359
Hello, Sarah.

228
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,113
- Stay still.
- Okay.

229
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:27,449
So do you know
where they are?

230
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:31,786
Uh, well, we just sort of

231
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:35,332
scattered them everywhere
out here.

232
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,959
What happened?

233
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:40,045
Why did you put the mines
back in?

234
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:42,964
'Cause he fucking
took everything!

235
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,466
The Prophet!

236
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:49,847
The cult came here last fall,
and they...

237
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:54,476
They stole your children!

238
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,478
- No!
- No, Allie!

239
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,480
- No, Allie!
- Don't move!

240
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,440
Stay there!
Stay there!

241
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:02,275
Stay there!

242
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:03,652
Oh, my God.

243
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,654
- I'm sorry, Gil. Gil.
- It's okay.

244
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:12,285
- Gil, I'm scared.
- I mean, they're your kids.

245
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:14,496
- It's okay. It's okay.
- It's all right.

246
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,374
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

247
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:22,796
Okay. Did anyone see
where she stepped?

248
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,798
- Kind of a straight line.
- Oh, my God.

249
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:26,466
No?

250
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:29,302
Okay. I think...

251
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:32,138
Sarah...

252
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:37,435
we could really use your light
and life more than ever now.

253
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,480
Good!

254
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:42,900
- It's an even year!
- What comedy are you doing?

255
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:46,403
"Hamlet."

256
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:51,032
Well, we said
we'd never do "Hamlet."

257
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:56,538
Well, that was back when we
made decisions together, so...

258
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,665
I see.

259
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:00,375
So what are you planning
for score?

260
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,502
- "Tubthumping"?
- Gil!

261
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:04,838
We all just almost died.

262
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:08,633
Could you not be an asshole
for a second?

263
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:10,635
- Sorry.
- You're not an asshole.

264
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:13,555
- Hi, Kirsten.
- Welcome back.

265
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:17,017
- Hi.
- Don't talk to him.

266
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:18,560
What did he do, though,
specifically?

267
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:21,813
Why did you let him in?

268
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:26,776
One day, a man and a boy
appear at our front door.

269
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,154
They're on a journey.

270
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:30,780
They are traveling
for the first time.

271
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:32,657
He even has crutches.

272
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:35,535
I mean, anyone who would be
disarmed by that story

273
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:37,996
in Year Twenty...

274
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,290
There's something
about him, though...

275
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:42,584
The Prophet.

276
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,377
You've met him?

277
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:46,338
We both did,

278
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:49,257
uh, at St. Deborah's last week.

279
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:51,384
Yeah, we talked to him.

280
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:54,846
I'm not saying I trusted him.
The opposite.

281
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:59,517
It was like he knew
I knew he was pretending.

282
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:01,561
- It was a game.
- To me, he just felt honest.

283
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:04,314
Most Pre-Pans don't.

284
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:07,734
Maybe if you're young enough,
he can be compelling.

285
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:10,612
But he's not innocent
or kind.

286
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:15,116
Anyway,
we gave them some food

287
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,618
and sent them on their way.

288
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:20,997
And he comes back
the very next day.

289
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:22,040
No crutches.

290
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:25,960
Different name,
different story, different kid.

291
00:17:26,044 --> 00:17:27,796
And we ask him why.

292
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,966
And he just smiles
and nods

293
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:35,428
and says,
"There's no before.

294
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:37,347
The survivors are the problem."

295
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:39,849
That psychopath
stole my grandkids.

296
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:40,934
We let them have a campfire.

297
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:44,062
He told a ghost story,
and two weeks later,

298
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:47,107
the only four children
of Pingtree were gone.

299
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:52,862
Penelope, Michael,
Brett Olson, Annie.

300
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:55,281
What was the story?

301
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:56,658
I don't know.

302
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:09,963
Would have
basic thinking skills.

303
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,589
Enough, Sarah!

304
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:15,176
We need your joy right now.

305
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:18,304
Okay, let's... let's talk
about the play.

306
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:21,266
Now, honestly,
"Hamlet" is easily

307
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,852
the most overrated play
of all time,

308
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:26,896
and, yes, I'm including
"August Osage County."

309
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:29,065
I love that play.

310
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:31,609
Oh, of course you do, Dieter.

311
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:34,654
- I'm not a great actor.
- I know that, Gil.

312
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:36,698
Well, we all know that,
Dieter.

313
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,199
I know that.

314
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:39,743
What's embarrassing
is that you don't know

315
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:41,911
you're a bad director.

316
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:43,037
You're not missed.

317
00:18:43,121 --> 00:18:45,040
I knew this would just become
a resentment festival.

318
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,875
Is there an expression
of basic joy?

319
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,877
- It's fine. We do this.
- This is what we do.

320
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,754
Golf with weapons?

321
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:53,006
The weapons
were already here.

322
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,216
Doesn't that sound a little
close-minded to you people?

323
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,677
Do you know what I think
is close-minded?

324
00:18:57,761 --> 00:19:00,513
Performing Shakespeare
without updating it.

325
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:04,059
Oh, that's one of the reasons
that you left, wasn't it, Gil?

326
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,727
It's one of the reasons, yes.

327
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:08,730
You don't like risk.

328
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,857
We're artists.

329
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:12,067
Everything is dangerous.

330
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:18,531
We have completely
deconstructed "Hamlet"

331
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:20,742
this season.

332
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:23,119
It's set in Poland.

333
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:24,746
- Portland.
- Whatever.

334
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,206
What?

335
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,417
Wendy is our writer.

336
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,086
Alex is the lead.

337
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:34,756
Hey, that's awesome.

338
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,257
Wow.

339
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:39,594
Well, this sounds interesting.

340
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,179
- Is this your first lead?
- Mm-hmm.

341
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:44,432
- Congratulations.
- That's great.

342
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:48,854
Afterwards, maybe I'll play
a little on that baby grand.

343
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:57,111
We should go rehearse, right?

344
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:06,120
I'm looking forward to this.

345
00:20:06,204 --> 00:20:08,206
Hardly finished here.

346
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,791
Dan! Now!

347
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,292
Thank you so much.
Dinner was wonderful.

348
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,378
Wait, what's a camcorder?

349
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,755
A camera that takes videos.

350
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:19,050
But phones make videos.

351
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:20,510
I'm not saying that.

352
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:24,222
- You are gonna say it.
- I'm not saying that.

353
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:27,809
- I'm the writer.
- I'm the actor.

354
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:29,352
Wen, I'm sorry,

355
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:31,312
this just doesn't feel
like the same play.

356
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:34,482
- It's not holding me.
- It makes sense, you guys.

357
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:39,320
This is actually...
It's so powerful, Wen.

358
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:40,738
Hamlet's the same.

359
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:41,948
He doesn't see that
Ophelia's faking everything.

360
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:43,867
He's obsessed
with his own emotions.

361
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:47,328
No, that's Ophelia.

362
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:48,079
- Forget it.
- This is gonna work.

363
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:50,540
Come on!
Let's put it on its feet.

364
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:52,917
You heard Gil.
They need us right now.

365
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:54,669
They need our light
and our life.

366
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:56,504
Come on, come on!
Oh, yes, it is gonna work.

367
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:57,672
- Hey.
- Sorry.

368
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:59,173
Is she directing now, too?

369
00:20:59,257 --> 00:21:01,968
Just... just be
more positive, okay?

370
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:04,053
It's your job to help,
no matter what,

371
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:06,723
even if you're not a lead.

372
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:07,807
Right.

373
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:12,562
Wen.

374
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:17,859
- Just try. Just once.
- Okay.

375
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:35,376
Where's my book?

376
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,212
- I don't know.
- Side pocket?

377
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:41,842
What did you do?

378
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,971
Did you take it?

379
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:25,569
Hi.

380
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:30,491
What are you doing here
behind my desk?

381
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:36,497
I was just looking
at your big book of...

382
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:41,753
I was thinking
of adding the word "great."

383
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:45,840
"The Great Book
of Joy and Despair."

384
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:47,633
Mm.

385
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:48,676
Fuck books.

386
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,762
You wanna putt?

387
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:53,056
I have balls.

388
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:56,893
Uh, I'm good.

389
00:23:56,977 --> 00:24:00,980
I don't know why I leave
that thing out there anyway.

390
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:04,442
Never try to write
an oral history of the world

391
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:06,695
after it ends.

392
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:17,706
We miss you,
for what it's worth.

393
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:22,627
I mean, the actors,
'cause we have no director.

394
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,423
And Dieter's wrong.

395
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:30,135
You were really good at it.

396
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:34,222
Yes.

397
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:48,612
Gil, can I ask you something?

398
00:24:50,488 --> 00:24:53,074
Is this what you thought
it would be?

399
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:54,909
Like, living off the wheel?

400
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:58,287
Oh, retirement.

401
00:24:58,371 --> 00:25:01,582
Ah, not really.

402
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:04,961
No, no.

403
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:08,798
"Our revels are now ended.

404
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:13,219
"Yea, all which it inherit...
Shall dissolve.

405
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:16,472
"We are such stuff
as dreams are made on,

406
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:20,060
a little life
rounded with a sleep."

407
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:37,494
Come back.

408
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:43,667
Leave with us.

409
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:48,880
What? You can.

410
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:53,468
Katrina just lost everything.

411
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:59,599
So did everyone,
20 years ago.

412
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,856
You sound like him,
you know?

413
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:09,984
The Prophet.

414
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:12,279
"There's no before," right?

415
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:17,783
I'm just saying
you should come home...

416
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:19,369
if that's what you want.

417
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:24,415
This is what I want.

418
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,727
"Station Eleven"
is the story

419
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:46,896
of a stranger named
Dr. Eleven,

420
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:50,650
who we first meet
floating unconscious in space

421
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:55,863
and who then gets stuck aboard
a broken space station.

422
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:59,075
Captain Lonegan is in charge,
but he has no crew

423
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:00,409
and is locked
inside the bridge

424
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:04,331
and just drinks scotch
and talks about the past.

425
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:12,922
And spilled
half an ocean

426
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:15,716
into the workstations
of the crew.

427
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,510
This drowned every grown-up.

428
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:22,139
The survivors are kids
called the Undersea.

429
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:24,225
They want to go home
and build a future Earth

430
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:26,727
by using time travel.

431
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:29,563
Dr. Eleven talks to both sides
and doesn't care

432
00:27:29,647 --> 00:27:32,233
- what happens or what they do.
- Hey, Jee.

433
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:35,403
He scares everyone.

434
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:36,738
You still scared
of the dark?

435
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:44,788
Yeah.

436
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:11,856
It's gonna get cold.

437
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:15,109
Hey, Luli.

438
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,218
- Hi.
- Hi.

439
00:28:44,597 --> 00:28:47,475
Nice to meet you, Kiki.

440
00:29:08,746 --> 00:29:12,333
What did the Prophet say
to you?

441
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:15,628
What was so amazing?

442
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:30,476
I wanna know. Really.

443
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:33,187
He asked me
to leave the Symphony.

444
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:34,271
And I said yes...

445
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:40,278
Because that's
how I felt that day.

446
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:47,368
And then
after the bonfire,

447
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:50,121
I went to go meet him,
and he didn't show.

448
00:29:58,379 --> 00:30:01,215
Well, thank God.

449
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:04,135
- I didn't wanna be with him.
- You get that, right?

450
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:07,555
I wanted to be the lead,
just once.

451
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:18,399
Well, I'm glad you get to.

452
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:26,240
It's weird that you do that.

453
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:27,408
It's weird that I do what?

454
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:29,953
Take weapons to a play.

455
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:38,461
Not to me, it's not.

456
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:42,840
We all bow to you!

457
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:44,383
You're wonderful!

458
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:47,970
I love you, Ophelia.

459
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:49,389
Can't you see that?

460
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:54,978
No, you can't.

461
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:08,699
You're fake.

462
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:10,577
My love is real.

463
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:15,956
You're just inside of it.

464
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:20,127
- I knit you out of it.
- Hi.

465
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:24,423
My entire family lived
and died before we met.

466
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:27,594
That's true of everyone here.

467
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:33,766
Fuck you, Hamlet.

468
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:46,821
Brava! Bravo!

469
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:04,213
It was inventive,
it was unlike anything

470
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:08,759
I've ever seen, and she,
Alexandra, my God...

471
00:32:08,843 --> 00:32:10,011
Absolutely wonderful.

472
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:18,561
You did bring us new life.

473
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:23,023
Well, we've been too scared
to be out here

474
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:24,442
since he came.

475
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:29,864
The Traveling Symphony
isn't afraid of anything.

476
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:35,286
- We're artists.
- We are terrified.

477
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:40,583
Well...

478
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:42,460
you don't seem to be.

479
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:49,496
Sometimes I think we should
be out there looking for them.

480
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:55,098
Well, maybe they'll just
come back on their own.

481
00:32:56,974 --> 00:32:58,726
- Sorry.
- Really important play thing.

482
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,686
Come on, girl. This way.

483
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:02,563
The way they held you
when you said it,

484
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:04,773
and there's just something
about being Hamlet, you know,

485
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:08,819
and just, like,
devouring people.

486
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:16,327
You were really great, Allie.

487
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:18,495
I should say that more often,
but you were.

488
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:20,247
- Come ride with me.
- We'll celebrate!

489
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:22,207
- Come, come, come. Come on!
- No. No, no, no, no, no.

490
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:23,208
- Come on. Come on.
- Stop.

491
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:27,087
- We'll ride the minefield.
- There's no before.

492
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:28,881
Hey!

493
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:32,718
Don't say that.
That guy's a psychopath.

494
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:35,638
He probably does the same thing
in every town he goes through.

495
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:38,432
No. That's you...

496
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:39,933
all of you.

497
00:33:40,017 --> 00:33:43,228
Oh, you never deviate.

498
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:46,106
Rules. Routines.

499
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:49,276
"We never split the troupe.
We never go off-wheel."

500
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:53,155
"Ah, wow! Hooray!
They're here.

501
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:55,324
"It's... it's the...

502
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:57,951
"The terrified carnival
of trauma!

503
00:33:58,035 --> 00:33:59,578
It's the Traveling Symphony!"

504
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:03,290
Hey! Just... stop it.

505
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:06,418
The Traveling Symphony
raised you.

506
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:08,128
- Watch your mouth.
- I'm going for a ride.

507
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:08,963
- No!
- No?

508
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:12,758
- You are not going!
- God damn it!

509
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:15,135
- Why not?
- Because he's still out there!

510
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:17,346
He didn't die
when I stabbed him!

511
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:21,433
Yes, I tried to protect you
at the bonfire, Alex!

512
00:34:21,517 --> 00:34:24,478
That's why he didn't
meet up with you.

513
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:26,146
You're welcome.

514
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:28,316
- Why are you so mad at me?
- I'm not...

515
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:34,113
Whatever happens to you
is my fault.

516
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:35,656
I haven't made a single
choice for myself

517
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:36,990
since I met you.

518
00:34:37,074 --> 00:34:38,742
I was just supposed
to walk you.

519
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:40,620
You made us leave Frank's.

520
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:45,290
Yeah, but we waited too long.

521
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:46,875
We stayed
for your fucking play.

522
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:50,421
Why are you being like this?

523
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:52,005
Because you can't just say

524
00:34:52,089 --> 00:34:55,509
you felt like leaving
the Traveling Symphony one day.

525
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:57,302
No.

526
00:34:57,386 --> 00:35:00,055
I can't.

527
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:01,557
I'm sorry.

528
00:35:04,101 --> 00:35:05,770
I'll just be downstairs.

529
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:10,858
- Don't worry.
- It's still in the Ziploc.

530
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:27,207
Alex, it's getting dark.

531
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:30,544
Just make sure
everyone comes inside.

532
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:31,712
Okay.

533
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:50,147
- Found this onstage.
- On the ground.

534
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:59,406
I never liked this recording.

535
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:02,576
Why not?

536
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:06,831
I recorded it two months
before my father passed away.

537
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:11,502
That's all I think about
every time I play it.

538
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:17,633
The whole thing just dies
when you try to capture it.

539
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:21,553
It's like it happened,
and then it ended,

540
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:24,515
and then,
that's it.

541
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:35,943
What's wrong?

542
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:38,904
Well, I moved
into a country club.

543
00:36:40,409 --> 00:36:42,175
You did do that.

544
00:36:42,795 --> 00:36:44,839
Yes, I did.

545
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:47,788
- These people respect you.
- Yeah.

546
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:51,000
Katrina there loves you.

547
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:57,798
I never treated you
very well.

548
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:59,258
Yes, you did.

549
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:03,303
You wrote a brand-new
fucking symphony every year.

550
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:06,265
You actually got better
after the world ended.

551
00:37:06,682 --> 00:37:08,809
So what?

552
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:12,771
You heard me.

553
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,027
You organized me.

554
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:27,328
Sarah...

555
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:34,585
You do know

556
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:40,132
that I love everything
we made together.

557
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:46,305
I feel the same way.

558
00:37:47,723 --> 00:37:50,184
But I didn't leave.

559
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:23,884
- Alex, you can't.
- There are mines out there.

560
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:25,594
- Alex!
- Alex.

561
00:39:24,987 --> 00:39:28,782
You're in our room.

562
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:29,909
Hi.

563
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:33,913
What are you wearing?

564
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:38,625
What is that?

565
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:41,128
Is that a mine?

566
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:45,549
They're beacons
for the Prophet.

567
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:47,176
Oh.

568
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:50,303
Well, maybe you can show me.

569
00:39:50,387 --> 00:39:53,849
Your friends are
gonna start to disappear.

570
00:39:56,018 --> 00:39:58,603
First, Alex.

571
00:39:58,687 --> 00:40:00,480
The Conductor maybe?

572
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:03,567
Who knows?

573
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:30,218
Penelope?

574
00:40:30,302 --> 00:40:31,554
I'm not Penelope.

575
00:40:35,432 --> 00:40:36,767
Okay.

576
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:38,477
He's wearing a bomb!

577
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:41,271
Stop!

578
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:48,111
You know,
I seem to remember

579
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:50,447
a little girl

580
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:54,951
who loved miniature golf.

581
00:40:55,035 --> 00:40:57,829
She loved it.

582
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:04,878
Gil, the kids have bombs!

583
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:08,048
Do you wanna try?

584
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:09,549
Show me.

585
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:25,107
Stop! No, no, no.

586
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:36,076
Gil, he's got a bomb!

587
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,995
- You came back.
- Gil!

588
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:40,789
- There is no...
- There is no before.

589
00:41:57,348 --> 00:42:01,184
- Captain's log.
- Star date 2817.6.

590
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:03,353
Starship "Enterprise"
diverted the schedule

591
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:06,022
for the purpose
of a confirmed discovery

592
00:42:06,106 --> 00:42:07,315
by Dr. Thomas Leighton.

593
00:42:07,399 --> 00:42:10,360
An extraordinary
new synthetic flu,

594
00:42:10,444 --> 00:42:14,227
which would totally end
the threat of famine.

595
00:42:14,322 --> 00:42:15,688
You mean to tell me,
you called me

596
00:42:15,773 --> 00:42:17,784
three light-years
off my course

597
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:19,620
just to accuse an actor
of being bogus?

598
00:42:57,616 --> 00:42:58,659
Jeevan!

599
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:07,000
- Jeevan!
- Guys!

599
00:43:08,305 --> 00:44:08,616
