2
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:21,220
Alex!

3
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:26,980
Alex!

4
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,440
Alex!

5
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:40,576
Alex.

6
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:44,660
Alex!

7
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:46,960
Alex!

8
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,916
Alex.

9
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,430
Alex.

10
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,980
Kirsten!

11
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,446
Alex.

12
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:22,616
Alex.

13
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,250
Alex!

14
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,040
Come on.

15
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:29,880
Come on.

16
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,300
Hi.

17
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:41,890
Hi.

18
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:51,270
Hi, I still don't know
what your name is.

19
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,686
- Do you know...
- This book...

20
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:55,816
This book

21
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,816
was started by a Red Bandana.

22
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:01,156
Are you familiar
with the Red Bandanas?

23
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,780
A little.

24
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:05,496
Do you know how they
recruited members?

25
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:07,660
They only ever chased me.

26
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,420
Or I killed them.

27
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:13,916
- I... I...
- The red bandana

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,126
wasn't a red bandana.

29
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:17,256
It was a bloody rag,

30
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,466
the kind you used to see
strewn about,

31
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:23,050
the kind that people would
cough themselves to death into.

32
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,766
Which brings us to the point
of the story.

33
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:27,060
- Look up...
- I lost the baby.

34
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:31,146
Oh.

35
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:33,310
I was reading my book.

36
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,526
I can't find her anywhere.

37
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:37,856
Huh.

38
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:41,906
You lost the baby.

39
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:45,616
Oh, boy. Hmm.

40
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:46,950
Hmm.

41
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:55,210
Hello, Alex.

42
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,376
Mm-hmm. Hi.

43
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:07,220
She likes to run away.

44
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:12,976
Maybe change her diaper?

45
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,570
Hi.

46
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:28,406
Shh.

47
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:30,746
Anyway,

48
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:33,080
the Red Bandanas are all dead,

49
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:34,876
and tonight we're performing
"The Tempest"

50
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,546
for the Pingtree
English Department.

51
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,210
Weird world, huh?

52
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,716
You know, the last time
I came to this place,

53
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,056
it was golf and weapons.

54
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:51,766
You know what I said
when I came into this room?

55
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:56,936
I said, "This should be
a theater.

56
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:00,440
"We could settle here,
make art,

57
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:02,446
"be safe,

58
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:04,446
stop running."

59
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,286
Hi.

60
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:11,746
Hi, Alex.

61
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:13,496
How are you?

62
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:15,790
So sorry.

63
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,126
I was distracted.

64
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:19,000
I won't ever
let it happen again.

65
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:20,670
I'll get rid of the book.

66
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,796
So sorry.

67
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,800
My name is Kirsten.

68
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:31,306
Finally, we get her name!

69
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:39,816
Alex!

70
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,070
Kirsten!

71
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,416
What happened?

72
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,660
They're stealing the mines.

73
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:02,710
- Back there.
- Kirs, what happened?

74
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,926
The Prophet killed Gil.

75
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:12,266
Why? Why would he kill Gil?

76
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:14,680
- He sent the kids back.
- They put mines on their chests.

77
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,856
I tried to stop it.

78
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:26,030
Kirs, your arm.

79
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,576
Oh.

80
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,870
Thanks.

81
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,330
He might have Alex.

82
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:43,086
- Hey, hey.
- I think you're in shock, okay?

83
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:45,380
We need to go back right now.

84
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,380
We are out here
by ourselves.

85
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:50,926
There's a fire.

86
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:52,596
- Hey.
- There's a fire.

87
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,430
Here's Dieter.

88
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,976
Here's S.

89
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:50,776
He's...

90
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:04,626
He's going to kill
the Traveling Symphony.

91
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,046
You okay?

92
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:55,340
If that's the gas station,

93
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:57,350
it's the rally point
for the musicians.

94
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:00,266
I'm worried about Kirsten.

95
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:02,516
Sarah too.

96
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,850
Go help her.

97
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:08,356
- Sarah?
- They're coming.

98
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,106
Hey.

99
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:13,696
- There's a body?
- No.

100
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:16,320
I don't think
there's any body left.

101
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:19,990
Here.

102
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,330
Try these.

103
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,550
Can you see?

104
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:34,926
- Does it matter?
- Sarah.

105
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:37,550
Don't be ridiculous.
Stay for a few more days.

106
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,220
It's too dangerous.

107
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:42,390
This monster's
obviously nearby.

108
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:47,310
We're gonna reconnect
with our people,

109
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,770
find our wagons,

110
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,316
and move on.

111
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,986
We're still missing Kirsten,
Sayid, and Alex.

112
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:55,820
No, Alex isn't missing.

113
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:59,326
She's been crying
all night with me.

114
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:00,700
Here she is.

115
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:04,910
She said she went for a ride,
got thrown by her horse.

116
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Kirsten's horse.

117
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,796
Kirsten and Sayid will

118
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,426
rally with us at the fork.

119
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:21,180
Like the others.

120
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:26,600
We lost someone last night.

121
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,316
There's no bodies, at least.

122
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,490
There.

123
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:23,490
They're coming here.

124
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,746
- Yeah, and two missing.
- That's us.

125
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:27,160
That means Alex is with them.

126
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,620
You see, everything's good,
Kirs.

127
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,996
Do you not see
what's right behind us?

128
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,126
How many Jesus dudes have
we met along the way, Kirs?

129
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:37,920
- No. He's different. He...
- This is my fault.

130
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:39,006
None of it is your fault.

131
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:41,386
Those kids were brainwashed.
They were terrorists.

132
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:43,800
- That's not what I mean.
- So what do you mean?

133
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:47,680
I did this, okay?

134
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:50,016
I stabbed him in St. Deb's.

135
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,560
He just didn't die.

136
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,066
He was in Alex's head.

137
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:59,196
Alex is not a child.

138
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,236
She doesn't fall in love
with cult leaders.

139
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,986
Just don't spin out.

140
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:10,620
Well, I'll feel better
when he's dead.

141
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:12,206
Also, I don't spin out.

142
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,920
You know
we should wait here, right?

143
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:22,966
- Then stay here.
- I'll be back before nightfall.

144
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:23,886
They'll be here soon.

145
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:58,706
- Hey!
- Hey, guys!

146
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:01,706
Come on over!
It's dry under here!

147
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:03,836
Come on!

148
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,836
Hey!

149
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,716
Come!

150
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,720
Come on!

151
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:14,220
Yeah!

152
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:15,430
Hey, Alex!

153
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,976
I knew you'd be okay!

154
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,380
Kirsten thought
you joined a cult!

155
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:22,310
- I'm already in a cult.
- Where is she?

156
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,230
- What happened, man?
- What the fuck, Sayid?

157
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,780
She went to kill that dude
the Prophet, man.

158
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:29,570
Why did you let her go?

159
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,780
She was just being
fucking Kirsten.

160
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:34,790
God damn it, Sayid!

161
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,750
Musicians will be
on their way soon.

162
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:47,836
Kirsten said she'd be back
by nightfall.

163
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,256
You need help?

164
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:53,216
- You okay?
- You okay?

165
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,720
Kirsten said
that you had plans

166
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,766
to meet with the Prophet.

167
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:59,180
Yeah, I did.

168
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:02,396
But no worries,
she stabbed him.

169
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,436
Back in St. Deborah's.

170
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,606
Well, did you thank her?

171
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:08,316
Because that dude
uses child soldiers.

172
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,200
- Hello there!
- Hello!

173
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,736
Yeah, I'll be okay.

174
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,446
Hello there!

175
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:16,656
Hello. I'm sorry.
Sorry to interrupt.

176
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:19,660
- No!
- Sorry to interrupt.

177
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:22,120
But we managed to catch
a performance of your orchestra

178
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:26,046
last night down the hill
in Nuevo Santiago.

179
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:27,626
Who's we?

180
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:28,586
My partner and I.

181
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:31,676
Your friends are on their way

182
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,590
to the Museum of Civilization.

183
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,386
They took us up on our offer.

184
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:36,970
- Oh, fuck.
- Yeah.

185
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:41,556
We'd like, very, very,
very, very, very, very,

186
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,726
very, very much for you
to perform Shakespeare for us.

187
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:46,396
At the museum,
it's comfortable.

188
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,816
It's warm. A place to rest.

189
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,696
I mean, there's silly danger.

190
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:54,450
There's so much can go wrong
out here.

191
00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:00,700
How's the symphony?

192
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:03,706
Vlad... Vlad complains a lot.

193
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:06,000
Yes?

194
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,500
I think this is
a grand idea.

195
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:09,920
- Wonderful!
- Go! Go!

196
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:12,676
- Come, come, come.
- Follow me. Follow me.

197
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,300
You're kidnapping us, right?

198
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,176
No.

199
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:24,266
I've had enough silly danger.

200
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:27,686
This is not good.

201
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:30,940
- Kirsten'll find us.
- She always does.

202
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,700
Luli!

203
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:05,910
Hey, Luli!

204
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,260
We pushed him.

205
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,890
Hi.

206
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:08,680
What's your name?

207
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:10,190
Dr. Eleven.

208
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,070
Do you know where David is?

209
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:21,150
Is he your dad?

210
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,116
He said you'd come.

211
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,490
He invited you
to join the Undersea.

212
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:29,536
They won't use chloroform
if you know it.

213
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:32,170
The Prophecy.

214
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,540
You should say it.

215
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,110
We're all going
to the same place.

216
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:07,656
Say it.
Say the Prophecy.

217
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:11,956
He said you know it too.

218
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,540
I...

219
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:23,926
My memories
are the same as yours.

220
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,430
They mean nothing.

221
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,110
I feel this again
for the first time.

222
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:42,606
I have a job to do.

223
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:50,290
I've found you
nine times before.

224
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,750
Maybe ten.

225
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,876
And I'll find you again...

226
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,340
Until the end.

227
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:04,260
I always do.

228
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,260
I find you...

229
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:12,680
because I know you.

230
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:16,016
And I know you...

231
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,896
because we are the same.

232
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,876
He won't let us up.

233
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,086
He says he'll only talk to you.

234
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:28,130
He didn't know I was coming.

235
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:39,056
That wound was deep.

236
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:41,610
He's probably gonna die
from complications.

237
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:07,170
- Will you take him this?
- Speaking of his wound.

238
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:11,636
Medical supplies.
Antibiotics.

239
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:15,426
They came down
in a low-orbit drop.

240
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:16,766
A low-orbit drop?

241
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:18,806
Acremonium.

242
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:20,726
It's a kind of fungus.

243
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:22,356
There's an old lady
who lives down by Pingtree

244
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,860
who knows how to make it.

245
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:29,490
They like it when things sound
like they're from the Prophecy.

246
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:47,166
Hey.

247
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:49,626
Try to get him to eat.

248
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:18,786
If I die,

249
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:21,036
I'll lose control
of the story.

250
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,456
It happened already.

251
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:25,040
When I was hurt,

252
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:28,376
Haley told the kids
a different story,

253
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,876
that the mines erased the past.

254
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,170
That was Pingtree.

255
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:40,016
Your friends are in trouble.

256
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,346
Half of them
are prisoners already.

257
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:43,186
The other half
are on their way.

258
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:45,686
What are you talking about?

259
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:49,396
The Museum of Civilization.

260
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:04,246
What about it?

261
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:25,640
There's real evil
in that place.

262
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:28,860
It's been rotting
for two decades.

263
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,900
They collect things.

264
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:36,610
They have your friends.

265
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:40,076
They also have something
of mine locked in their tower.

266
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:47,036
You're the key.

267
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,666
Get me in, I'll take you
to the Symphony.

268
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:56,760
Fuck.

269
00:25:57,970 --> 00:25:58,800
Fuck.

270
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,680
Pass me the antibiotics.

271
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:24,656
Hi.

272
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:35,380
The troupe will be inside
by the time we catch up.

273
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:40,176
They have snipers.
Electrified fences.

274
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:42,050
Surveillance.

275
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,220
Who knows what else by now?

276
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:46,306
But if we're together,

277
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:47,830
you could tell them
I'm an actor too.

278
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:53,060
It's up to you.

279
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:54,150
We don't force things.

280
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:23,220
I missed your kidney
by an inch.

281
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:28,970
Must've been the play.

282
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:31,936
You seemed upset onstage.

283
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:36,610
How come?

284
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:42,240
You remembered something.

285
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:53,876
Who?

286
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:04,386
If I get you in,

287
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:06,970
how do I know
you'll leave us alone?

288
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,140
You can't.

289
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,820
They're my family.

290
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:24,906
I don't care
about anyone but them.

291
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:44,926
Road's End by nightfall.

292
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:48,760
Yeah!

293
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:01,066
She's in the Undersea.

294
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:02,650
She's one of us.

295
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,860
Come on.

296
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:54,290
You're in the Undersea now.

297
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:59,456
If at any time,
there's anything I can do

298
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:01,376
to make your stay
more comfortable,

299
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:03,086
please let me know.

300
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:04,960
How far is it?

301
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:06,630
- You know what I miss?
- Hot tubs.

302
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,966
Do you guys... do you guys
have hot tubs?

303
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:09,340
- Dan.
- Yes?

304
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:11,176
How far is it?

305
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:17,516
I'm okay.
Go ahead, go.

306
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,520
- Go.
- How far is it?

307
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:23,690
I mean, this looks like
all hot tub stuff.

308
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,776
You're sure there's not one
on the facility or...

309
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:26,946
- I'm sure.
- How do you know?

310
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:28,526
How long have you been there?

311
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:30,280
Wagons... where are wagons?

312
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:31,656
Everything's been
taken care of,

313
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:34,156
like your Conductor's
glasses, yes?

314
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,870
I told you, we have everything
you need right here.

315
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:38,536
Your friends...
Your friends are safe.

316
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:41,246
- They're safe.
- The glasses don't work.

317
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:42,546
She had a special prescription.

318
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:46,210
- It's okay.
- Let's just get to 'em.

319
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,596
You might want
to cover your eyes.

320
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:58,476
I already can't see, though.

321
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:01,936
That's why. Okay.

322
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:04,396
The...

323
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,940
quarantine
won't last long.

324
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:10,110
Welcome, welcome
to the Museum of Civilization.

325
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:13,196
- Is it them?
- Yeah.

326
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,446
- Did we make it?
- Yes, yes.

327
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:15,990
There's running water.

328
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,786
But the pressure's
not always consistent.

329
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:19,956
- You guys made it!
- This is amazing.

330
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,370
You guys are here!

331
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:23,416
You fucking made it!

332
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,250
I can't...

333
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,216
Look at us!

334
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:32,756
Fucking Vlad.

335
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,136
You good?

336
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:35,510
Fucking Vlad.

337
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,270
- Go, go, go, go, go.
- Go, go, go.

338
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:41,690
No fucking way.

339
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:51,030
It's really a nice place.

340
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:52,776
I left for a while.

341
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:55,780
That's what they tell me.
But I came back.

342
00:31:55,870 --> 00:32:00,410
And I have no memory
from before, but...

343
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:03,210
I've been happy here.

344
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:11,420
How the fuck does
that elevator work?

345
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:13,636
Everything works.

346
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,680
We'll have food
sent down for supper.

347
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:23,350
What?

348
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:28,356
So what do you want?
We got showers and we got...

349
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:44,496
We got some food...

350
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,300
Open the fucking door!

351
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,850
Hey.
Hey.

352
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:03,640
- Hey.
- Hey.

353
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:07,270
Hey.

354
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,230
I should have been watching.

355
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,696
I was distracted.

356
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:15,736
Yeah, then you
would have caught me, right?

357
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:18,366
Yeah.

358
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:20,156
Yeah?

359
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:27,540
- Somebody help!
- Somebody!

360
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:30,796
Help!
Help!

361
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,960
Your soul is so sweet.

362
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:37,926
I'm just happy
you fell in love.

363
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:41,180
It made you stop
going to work all the time.

364
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,890
We work too fucking much.

365
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,396
I need help!

366
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:54,316
Somebody! Help!

367
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:57,070
Dr. Eleven has reappeared.

368
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:03,790
The transmission was,
"We made it."

369
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:06,786
We're on the edge.

370
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:11,090
The timelines,
they finally match.

371
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:18,680
They've asked me
to light the torch.

372
00:34:23,390 --> 00:34:25,180
There.

373
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:31,310
Look!

374
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:34,940
That's them.

375
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:36,650
You see them?

376
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:46,826
Eleven is working with Lonagan.

377
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:50,996
This cycle, it's different.

378
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:55,710
Kirsten, she's with us now.

379
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,376
She's one of us.

380
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,860
They're asleep.

381
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:19,986
Took a few extra stories.

382
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,616
They're nervous.

383
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:29,246
We should be making up time,
not babysitting.

384
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:30,830
I can't leave them.

385
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,126
Those woods...

386
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:36,250
are really scary at night.

387
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,220
They love that story.

388
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,720
Where did you first hear it?

389
00:35:57,230 --> 00:36:01,320
When I was a kid,
someone gave me a comic book.

390
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:07,490
I read it and... lost it.

391
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,200
Tried to forget it.

392
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:14,170
It all came to me
when I needed it the most.

393
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:20,546
That blue spaceman

394
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:22,380
really calmed me down.

395
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:26,720
That's because Dr. Eleven
is a kid.

396
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:31,180
It's K inside the suit,

397
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:33,266
the Rebel Undersea Leader.

398
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:35,100
She's in a time loop.

399
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:39,690
Never thought
about it like that.

400
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,696
I do relate, though.

401
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:47,406
I'm a Post-Pan.

402
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:48,616
Just born before.

403
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:53,530
Most Pre-Pans
lost their minds.

404
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:58,130
- Yeah.
- That's the whole problem.

405
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:03,586
My father's first wife
was an artist.

406
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:05,636
Not my mother.

407
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:08,220
They both died before.

408
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,766
But when he was alive,
he spoke Spanish,

409
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:16,186
and he thought
she didn't, so...

410
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:19,270
he would have all these
conversations in front of her

411
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:22,606
with his dad
about how selfish she was,

412
00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:25,110
how crazy,

413
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,320
how he loved her
but she didn't love him,

414
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:29,450
how he didn't understand
her art.

415
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:35,286
After she left him, she called
to say that she loved him.

416
00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:38,000
And they had that whole
conversation in Spanish.

417
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:42,340
She told him he had never asked
her anything about herself.

418
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,300
That doesn't seem fair.

419
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,820
I don't speak Spanish.

420
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:11,330
Neither do I.

421
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:20,330
Sleep.
We walk with the light.

422
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:25,300
- Wait.
- What's that game they play?

423
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:27,760
The one like tag?

424
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:29,760
Infection.

425
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:34,850
The only way everybody wins
is, everybody gets sick.

426
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:39,060
Oh. Fun.

427
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:41,976
Sometimes no one wins.

428
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:44,980
Kids just keep on running.

429
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,450
They find some town.

430
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:53,196
They tell people
their name's the Prophet.

431
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,616
They ask kids if they want
to join the Undersea.

432
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:02,040
Is that how you know it?

433
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:04,586
You met one of them
along the way?

434
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:09,716
No.

435
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:18,366
So the internet
was real, then?

436
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:20,910
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah, the internet was real.

437
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,830
What was it like?

438
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:27,626
It was, like,
a whole bunch of computers

439
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:30,756
could talk to each other
from anywhere in the world.

440
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:34,840
And you could send
messages or pictures.

441
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:39,806
And you could read any book,
watch any movie.

442
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:42,690
You could find anyone.

443
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:49,776
- Sounds beautiful.
- Yeah.

444
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:51,440
Why do you ask?

445
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:54,156
That's what's
in the museum.

446
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,570
On a little black thing
this big.

447
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:57,156
Oh.

448
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:59,910
He says old data's
like a weed.

449
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,160
I don't know.

450
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:05,040
I liked Instagram.

451
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,880
What about you?

452
00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:17,006
What do you want?

453
00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:19,806
I want him to survive

454
00:41:19,890 --> 00:41:22,140
so the Traveling Symphony
survives.

455
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:27,266
You don't...

456
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:31,106
You don't think that we'll live
if the Prophet doesn't?

457
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:34,446
- No way.
- They'll find you.

458
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:37,196
He's been building up
the Undersea for ten years.

459
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,490
They're coming
when he lights the torch.

460
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:46,206
Bandanas!
Bandanas!

461
00:41:54,130 --> 00:41:56,340
- Go.
- Go!
