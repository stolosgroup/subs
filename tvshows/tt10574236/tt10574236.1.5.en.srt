2
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:14,097
Tyler, can you hear me?

3
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:18,101
Look, I know you're mad.

4
00:00:21,646 --> 00:00:23,397
Come on, Tyler.

5
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,115
Clark and I are worried.

6
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:37,119
Whatever you think happened,
it's just...

7
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:39,705
it's just grown-up stuff.

8
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:45,878
Ladies and gentlemen...

9
00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:49,715
Weird time to fly.

10
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:50,424
Yeah.

11
00:00:57,766 --> 00:00:59,142
She's from Alpha/Beta.

12
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:04,438
Elizabeth!

13
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:06,649
Elizabeth!

14
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:12,864
Oh, she... she's a friend.

15
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:17,576
Elizabeth!

16
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:19,036
Once you're seated,
fasten your seat belt

17
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,329
and also make sure
your seat back

18
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:24,125
and serving trays are at
their full upright position.

19
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:25,877
She mustn't have heard me.

20
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:39,098
Sorry.
Little help.

21
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:40,766
I'll get it!

22
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:54,822
Hi.

23
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:57,408
Clark.

24
00:01:57,492 --> 00:02:00,411
I saw you in LaGuardia
eating a pretzel.

25
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:05,583
So shocking, Elizabeth,
so shocking.

26
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:07,501
My lawyer called
during the layover.

27
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:10,546
Tyler doesn't know.

28
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,423
And now...

29
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:15,802
Oh, look,
we're in a shit indie movie.

30
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:20,431
- C-can he not hear us?
- No.

31
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,352
Why are you going to Chicago?

32
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:28,898
Well, I was still listed as
an executor of Arthur's estate.

33
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:33,402
I'm...

34
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:37,907
I'm responsible for getting
the body back to Mexico.

35
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,367
I mean, I-I'm just so sorry
for Tyler.

36
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:43,496
Mm.

37
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,415
Was it hard to remember
our names?

38
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:47,917
Whose?

39
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,252
All the women
that Arthur fucked.

40
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:57,092
- I usually wasn't aware...
- You never made a mistake.

41
00:02:57,176 --> 00:02:59,136
I...

42
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,263
Elizabeth...

43
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:05,392
How's Tyler doing?

44
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:08,103
Not great, but...

45
00:03:08,187 --> 00:03:10,064
he won't admit it.

46
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:14,401
Excuse me, sir.
You're standing in my way.

47
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:16,946
- Sorry.
- Sei pazzo.

48
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,740
- Is he bothering you?
- Oh, no, she's, um...

49
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:21,116
Ladies and gentlemen,

50
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,203
we've got a bit
of a hiccup in Chicago,

51
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:25,788
and we're being diverted
to Severn City, Michigan.

52
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:28,374
- You're kidding me.
- Oh.

53
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,334
Shouldn't be too long.

54
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:31,335
Please leave first class.

55
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:36,257
It's okay, Brian.
He's, uh... he's just a fan.

56
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:39,176
Please return to your seats
and fasten your seat belts.

57
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:17,506
Ladies and gentlemen, we are
getting more information

58
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,134
on the larger global situation
as it comes in,

59
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:22,553
and we will continue
to update you.

60
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:24,555
Thank you
for your understanding.

61
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,731
We don't seem to be hearing
each other.

62
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:36,025
Do you even know what
a United Nations Ambassador is?

63
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,651
She has been to Nepal.

64
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:40,362
She has done humanitarian work
in Belize.

65
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:43,490
Hey, I'm getting a car
from the rental desk...

66
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:45,367
Brian!

67
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:47,328
Just... if you and Tyler
wanted to, um...

68
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:50,539
My assistant just got us
a jet... it's en route.

69
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:51,832
Oh, fantastic.

70
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:54,377
- T-to Chicago?
- Mm.

71
00:04:56,796 --> 00:05:00,008
He's the agent.
I'm the nanny.

72
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:02,551
There's
the first-class lounge.

73
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:03,886
Brian, let's take that.

74
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,262
Tyler?

75
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:07,598
Shay, can you get him?
Tyler!

76
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:12,353
Why?

77
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:16,065
It is your job
to get me out of here!

78
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,691
Michi-what?

79
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:20,611
- Jesus.
- I'm sorry.

80
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:23,030
Don't worry about it.

81
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:25,074
Um, could you tell me where
the, uh, car rental desk is?

82
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,742
- No cars.
- Everything's rented.

83
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,535
I need to get to Chicago.

84
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:31,580
Well, okay, Steve Martin.
Let me call John Candy.

85
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:33,374
We'll get you both back home
for Thanksgiving.

86
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:36,001
I need you to get me
on a flight, now!

87
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:38,087
That is not an option.
Do you hear me?

88
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,672
That is not an option!

89
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:40,923
Sir!

90
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:44,009
I need you to take a breath.

91
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:45,344
Fuck you.

92
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:47,763
Down you get.
Down you get.

93
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,264
Ah!

94
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:19,086
Your attention,
ladies and gentlemen.

95
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,338
All flights have been canceled
at this time.

96
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:23,215
Come on!

97
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:26,802
Deaths inside critical
international logistics firms

98
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,429
could cause a catastrophe
in the coming days,

99
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:32,934
regardless of case numbers
dramatically dropping.

100
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:39,314
Cain, if you're watching this,
you need to listen to me.

101
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:42,067
This is real. Take the kids
to your parents' place, now.

102
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:45,654
Back roads only,
no motorways.

103
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:47,323
Excuse me.

104
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,326
Holy shit.

105
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:57,583
God has a plan.

106
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:59,001
Uh-huh.

107
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,963
Let's fucking hope so.

108
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:05,924
Hey, it's Tim.

109
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:07,801
Try leaving a message.

110
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:09,928
I hate phones.
Bye!

111
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:12,931
Hiya.
Um, I forgot my charger.

112
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:14,976
So I'm gonna have
to borrow one.

113
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:19,521
This flu seems substantial.

114
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:23,525
But don't worry.
N-no one has it here, so...

115
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:52,387
I just heard them say

116
00:07:52,471 --> 00:07:55,349
they're not letting people
get off that one.

117
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,436
The people on
that plane are sick.

118
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:03,607
Holy shit.

119
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:07,569
I mean, they... they still
have rights as citizens.

120
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,738
And if they need
medical attention...

121
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:13,826
I guess it doesn't matter.

122
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,369
This flu kills everyone.

123
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:18,539
We're all dead
if they come inside here.

124
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:29,592
Would you die for a stranger?

125
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,807
Probably not.

126
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,062
Excuse me.

127
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:09,090
They're bringing the luggage.

128
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:12,510
Thank you.

129
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:16,305
All remaining baggage

130
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:19,641
will be available
in the atrium only

131
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,727
beneath
the "Edmund Fitzgerald."

132
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:23,520
Good luck.

133
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:35,616
Excuse me.

134
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:39,953
I'm such a fan.
You just have no idea.

135
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:42,247
- Thank you.
- Would you mind?

136
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:43,498
Um...

137
00:09:43,582 --> 00:09:44,667
yeah, sure.

138
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:53,008
I mean, you'd think
at a time like this...

139
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,346
I mean, she's famous.
Big deal.

140
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,056
I'll tell you what...
She won't be very famous

141
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,642
if everyone
on the fucking planet dies.

142
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:17,366
Wow.

143
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,035
Serious business.

144
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,578
Do you remember me?

145
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:24,165
I'm a friend of your father's.

146
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,918
Uncle Clark.

147
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:41,807
I think you're very smart.

148
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:47,688
And I think you know
exactly what call

149
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:51,858
your mother got
back in New York...

150
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:52,942
last night.

151
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:58,199
Your father...

152
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,205
Hmm.

153
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:15,132
You know, I don't know what's
gonna happen with this flu.

154
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:18,635
Civilization is a complex,
self-correcting mechanism,

155
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:22,014
as complex as a person, ah...

156
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:23,807
only self-aware
to a degree.

157
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:26,310
Eh...

158
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:28,437
you understand.

159
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:32,483
But whatever happens...

160
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:35,986
I'm your uncle Clark.

161
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:50,834
"The worst I may be yet.

162
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:52,294
"The worst is not

163
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:55,672
"as long as we can say...

164
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:58,759
'this is the worst.'"

165
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:12,272
M-Mom! Mom!

166
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:15,609
Does, um, she need help?

167
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:18,779
I don't know.

168
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:22,699
I quit my job
a couple of hours ago.

169
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:25,786
Had my gear in my truck,
thank God.

170
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:28,747
Oh.

171
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:40,050
I think this thing
is really happening, man.

172
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:45,556
You can see it out there...

173
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:50,352
Kind of this...

174
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:54,314
glaze in people's eyes.

175
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:56,859
It's like the whole world
is just this now.

176
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:04,282
They're all heroes
on board that plane...

177
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:06,201
every single one of them.

178
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:12,707
We'll get through this.

179
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:16,337
My optimism's intact.

180
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:22,384
You sure that's not
the liquid courage?

181
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,469
- Probably.
- Probably.

182
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:45,240
Can you put on
something else?

183
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:51,746
God!
Change the fucking channel!

184
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:55,417
- No!
- It's my TV, bitch.

185
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:14,519
Clark Thompson.

186
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:17,105
No smoking.

187
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:18,273
I see from my files here
you've been doing some business

188
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,484
with Goldman Sachs.

189
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:24,154
Is that my Linkedln page?

190
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:26,615
I obviously can't let this
go wide,

191
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,700
but I'm looking
for useful people,

192
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:32,829
thoughtful people,
skilled people...

193
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:33,997
like you.

194
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:35,957
Ah, I'm not sure

195
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:39,378
I know
what you're talking about.

196
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:44,174
I'm talking
about zombies, man.

197
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,179
Good.

198
00:14:50,889 --> 00:14:52,307
Stay out
of my beach community.

199
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:12,368
Who's that guy?

200
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:15,997
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is Agent Nick Roker,

201
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:19,459
Homeland Security,
with a little announcement.

202
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:21,378
I know these are trying times,
but we need you

203
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:23,505
to be a little more respectful
of the facilities here,

204
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:26,466
restrooms especially.

205
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,843
We have no further updates
for you at this time.

206
00:15:28,927 --> 00:15:32,347
We'll all get through
this together.

207
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:33,098
Roker out.

208
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:18,769
You're grounded, fuckers.

209
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:28,028
No way.

210
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:30,531
Finally, a fucking signal.

211
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:37,954
Hey, where are you?

212
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:40,582
Call me.

213
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,543
I wish you were here.

214
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:47,505
I've been thinking about
the "I accept this" thing,

215
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:50,925
Dr. Norman, and I-I do not.

216
00:16:51,009 --> 00:16:53,887
I-I do not accept this.

217
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,687
I'm really sick.

218
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:05,440
I have it.

219
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:06,608
I'm sorry.

220
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:09,611
It wasn't true, what I said.

221
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:13,198
I just can't take
two weeks off.

222
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:15,659
Remember that time at Jonny's?

223
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,664
I love you.

224
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:24,959
Why didn't you call?

225
00:17:58,076 --> 00:17:59,828
Can I talk to you?

226
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,330
Your assistant
never got you a jet.

227
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,499
She's probably dead.

228
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,167
Oh, Uncle Clark.

229
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:08,211
- Your plane's not coming.
- It will!

230
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:09,838
I just have to find
my passport.

231
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,590
This isn't healthy
for anyone,

232
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:15,009
and it sends the message
to everyone inside

233
00:18:15,093 --> 00:18:16,678
that you'd rather freeze
to death

234
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,471
than be a part
of their community.

235
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:20,390
I would.

236
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:22,934
Elizabeth, powerful people
tend to crash hard

237
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:26,396
when huge pockets
of false reality come down.

238
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,065
I see it in my work
all the time.

239
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:31,443
I'm a corporate consultant.

240
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,445
Here I thought you were
a lounge singer.

241
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,697
No, I'm a CEO whisperer.

242
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:38,032
And you get paid for that...

243
00:18:38,116 --> 00:18:41,202
Stroking the egos
of powerful men?

244
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:43,705
I can use what I know
to protect you,

245
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:44,706
all three of us,

246
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,041
if you'll accept my help.

247
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:48,960
You sound
like a movie villain.

248
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:51,755
- Tyler needs attention.
- Tyler's fine. He's with Shay.

249
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:55,759
He's sitting in front
of a plane of corpses!

250
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,390
We got to get out of here, T.

251
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,101
Look...

252
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:11,399
Ladies, Agent Nick Roker,
Homeland Security.

253
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:12,942
I'm putting a team together.
Maybe you can help.

254
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:15,779
You ever been
to the Florida Keys?

255
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:17,947
There's a little island
there called Anastasia Island.

256
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:21,159
Any experience piloting a boat?

257
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,870
I'm looking for people
with specific skill sets.

258
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:25,663
Ladies and gentlemen,

259
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:27,957
this is Agent Nick Roker,
Homeland Security,

260
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:30,168
with a quick reminder
that all restricted areas

261
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:31,836
are still off-limits

262
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:35,173
to anyone other
than authorized personnel.

263
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:48,478
Uh, I've said this
a couple of times now,

264
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:51,105
but, please,
anyone with extra trash,

265
00:19:51,189 --> 00:19:53,566
especially things that
can rot, put it out front.

266
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:56,486
Roker out.

267
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:01,324
Jerry.

268
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:03,285
Jerry, Jerry, Jerry.

269
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,373
What a wicked web
we fucking weave.

270
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:25,390
Agent Roker, you naughty boy.

271
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:14,439
What's happened?

272
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:18,109
Mr. Homeland Security
apparently went around

273
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:20,695
and told
all the people he liked

274
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:25,116
that he's leaving for
a better world... Miami Beach.

275
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,036
Movie star's nanny left.

276
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,455
And the Italian boyfriend.

277
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:33,291
I'm surprised
she didn't go with.

278
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,877
Do we know how many he took?

279
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:39,088
He took mostly women.

280
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:40,715
The whole soccer team...

281
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,384
except the goalie.

282
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:59,150
Um...

283
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:01,903
uh, could I have
your attention, please?

284
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:04,238
Could you turn around?
This is important.

285
00:22:04,322 --> 00:22:05,949
Sorry, this is important!

286
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:08,410
Could you turn around?

287
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:14,499
Um...

288
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:17,752
this is the best thing that
could have possibly happened.

289
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:20,421
Okay, they left.

290
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:22,256
They didn't invite you, or me,

291
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:26,010
because they thought
they were better than you.

292
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:30,056
They thought they deserved
to live and you didn't.

293
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:33,893
They were in it for themselves.

294
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:37,230
And the only problem
with their plan is...

295
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:38,815
they were taken in
by a janitorial con man.

296
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:40,316
- What?
- What?

297
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,570
Late last night,
after some investigation,

298
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:48,366
it came to my attention
that, uh, our Agent Roker,

299
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:53,746
who's been in charge since
the early days, was a fraud.

300
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:56,457
- Whoa. What?
- Yeah.

301
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,292
His real name is Jerry Mercer,

302
00:22:58,376 --> 00:23:00,294
and up until a week
and a half ago,

303
00:23:00,378 --> 00:23:03,756
he was the night custodian
of this airport.

304
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,218
- What?
- No way.

305
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:09,846
Did any of you ever stop
to wonder why there was

306
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:13,891
a Homeland Security team
at Severn City, Michigan?

307
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:15,310
No?

308
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:16,310
He was an opportunist,

309
00:23:16,394 --> 00:23:18,980
and he took advantage
of your fear

310
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:21,733
and the illusion of his power,

311
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:24,819
and he has likely just led
all those people

312
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:27,113
to their death.

313
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:29,157
I mean, w-who was even flying?
Who was...

314
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:31,826
Our captain.

315
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:32,994
Huh. Irrelevant.

316
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:35,872
In fact, good. Good.

317
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:37,248
- But we had a pilot.
- Now we don't.

318
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:39,292
H-how is that good?

319
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:41,002
Because you need a pilot when
there's somewhere to go, yeah?

320
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:43,046
And where do we have to go?

321
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:46,340
What appointments matter now?

322
00:23:46,424 --> 00:23:50,636
We have to abandon
the future, okay?

323
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:55,433
All that matters is the now
and what got us to this point,

324
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:58,644
because the past is a map,
and it got us here,

325
00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:00,563
and here, at this airport,

326
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:04,525
we have won
the post-apocalyptic lottery!

327
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:09,280
And that plane leaving
just made all our shares go up!

328
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:10,823
Okay?

329
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:13,284
The drawbridge is closed,

330
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:15,036
because Jerry Mercer,

331
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,413
the fucking coward
Jerry Mercer,

332
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:20,541
has effectively tripled
our food supply.

333
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,210
Here we are...

334
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,087
with much of our hierarchy
of needs already met.

335
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:27,381
We have shelter.
We have food.

336
00:24:27,465 --> 00:24:29,300
- That's right.
- Yeah.

337
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:33,554
We're a community.

338
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:35,056
And we're tucked away
in a place

339
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:38,935
no one is ever gonna find us.

340
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,061
How do you know
he was faking, though?

341
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:43,064
Maybe you made this up.

342
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:44,941
You think I made this up?

343
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:46,067
For fuck's sake, Constance,
look at it.

344
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:49,654
- Look at it.
- It's true.

345
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:55,285
I knew Mercer.

346
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:59,413
Thought he was harmless...

347
00:24:59,497 --> 00:25:01,625
just doing his thing.

348
00:25:04,502 --> 00:25:07,505
But when I said something,
he threatened to kill me.

349
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:13,928
He told me
he would take me...

350
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:17,473
but I'd have to leave my child.

351
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:23,271
I confronted him last night
with Miles and Elizabeth...

352
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:25,773
and instead
of facing you today,

353
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:29,611
he snuck away in the night
with the female soccer team...

354
00:25:32,155 --> 00:25:33,781
Except for the goalie.

355
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:35,408
- I never trusted that guy.
- Yeah, me neither!

356
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:40,454
See, everybody shits
on the goalie, you know?

357
00:25:40,538 --> 00:25:43,124
They like the strikers,
the flash.

358
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:46,752
But the goalie...
That's how you win things.

359
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:47,879
He's right.

360
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:51,841
And we're in this together,
and we're a family now.

361
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:56,012
And I say fuck Jerry Mercer.
Fuck him.

362
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:57,180
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

363
00:25:57,264 --> 00:26:00,141
- That's right.
- Yeah.

364
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,225
Fuck him.

365
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:02,393
Fuck him!

366
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:02,935
Fuck Jerry Mercer!

367
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:09,150
- Fuck him.
- Fuck that guy.

368
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:09,984
- Fuck Jerry Mercer.
- Fuck him.

369
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:11,986
Fuck Jerry Mercer!

370
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:21,996
Well played, Marc Antony.

371
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,998
You're a star.

372
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:32,006
We've really got
something here.

373
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:33,883
You know?

374
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:36,344
The... the four of us,
including Tyler,

375
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:38,638
'cause I-I don't discount him.

376
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:41,098
You know, the sympathy
for the children, the child.

377
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:44,477
Some connotation of Arthur.

378
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:47,939
Mm.

379
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:50,191
Your celebrity
is a little less relevant

380
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:52,777
in a post-apocalyptic context.

381
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:54,362
I know.

382
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:56,530
No, but it still has
a sparkle to it.

383
00:26:56,614 --> 00:26:58,366
- They remember your fame.
- Oh, that's true.

384
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:01,535
And, Miles, your connection
to a federal institution

385
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:03,829
gives you
the natural leader profile.

386
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:05,957
Why do we need a leader
at all?

387
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:09,460
Because, Tyler,
leaders give us hope.

388
00:27:09,544 --> 00:27:11,545
And we won't survive here
long enough

389
00:27:11,629 --> 00:27:13,005
to repopulate the Earth

390
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:15,716
if the people here
don't feel hopeful.

391
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,176
Maybe we shouldn't, though.

392
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:21,013
Shouldn't what, Tyler?

393
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:22,932
Repopulate.

394
00:27:24,642 --> 00:27:26,978
That's a little bleak,
isn't it?

395
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:29,689
No, it's cute.

396
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:37,071
My hot spot
still works at night...

397
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:39,407
German satellite.

398
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:42,618
We could download Wikipedia,
whatever else we can find.

399
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:44,537
Good idea.

400
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:46,831
Yeah, get whatever you can
about, uh, electricity,

401
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:48,082
engineering.

402
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:51,002
Shakespeare.

403
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:54,005
So what, it'll be a...

404
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:55,089
a triumvirate?

405
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:59,051
- Mm.
- Yeah.

406
00:27:59,135 --> 00:28:01,095
But with four.

407
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:11,188
- Go ahead. Try it.
- Santa can hear.

408
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:13,775
- I just...
- I just want my brother.

409
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:19,322
Santa's elves can make
your brother.

410
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:21,198
It's like AI.

411
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:24,827
- Where are the children?
- In the tower.

412
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:27,413
Tyler had an idea.

413
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:29,791
- Seriously, try it.
- Santa talks to dead people.

414
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:35,254
You'll feel better
if you say something.

415
00:28:35,338 --> 00:28:37,381
Doesn't matter
if he can hear you.

416
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:42,637
Hey, Ryan,
I hope you're good...

417
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:46,932
And you get good things
for Christmas like "Fortnite."

418
00:28:47,016 --> 00:28:49,518
Right?

419
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:57,234
We play in my head.

420
00:28:57,318 --> 00:28:59,904
Okay, kids, downstairs.

421
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:02,532
You're not supposed
to be up here.

422
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:06,202
Come on.

423
00:29:08,746 --> 00:29:10,831
How did you get up here?

424
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:12,750
It was working.

425
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:43,948
Hi, Arthur.

426
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:45,199
Are you there?

427
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:48,119
Hi, it's Clark.

428
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:51,122
Yeah. Yeah, no,
good to hear from you, too.

429
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:55,209
Listen, I'm sitting here
with your son,

430
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:58,796
and I'm sorry to say it,
but he's being a real knob.

431
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,715
Yeah, asking all the other kids
to pretend,

432
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:03,384
but he won't play the game.

433
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:07,555
Was he always like this?

434
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:08,806
Yes, he's here.

435
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:11,517
Yes, right here. Okay.

436
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:13,353
Okay.

437
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:38,127
Hey, Dad.

438
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:40,921
Sorry I didn't get a chance

439
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:43,591
to come see your play
in Chicago.

440
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:45,468
I really wanted to.

441
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:47,511
I was really excited.

442
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:50,222
Mom had a night shoot.

443
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:53,058
She really tried.

444
00:30:53,142 --> 00:30:56,645
Anyway, it's cool
that you did "King Lear."

445
00:30:56,729 --> 00:30:58,898
I don't know what else to say.

446
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:04,445
I'm glad I saw you last month,

447
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:06,947
but...

448
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:09,283
I wish I could see you again.

449
00:31:18,876 --> 00:31:20,878
Now, how'd that feel?

450
00:31:23,506 --> 00:31:26,884
Okay, so no one panic,

451
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:28,802
but the electrical grid
must have gone down,

452
00:31:28,886 --> 00:31:31,180
because we switched
to generator overnight.

453
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:34,266
That means, though,
we'll be using power sparingly.

454
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:36,477
- How sparingly?
- Yeah, exactly.

455
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:38,395
No lights during the day.

456
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:40,731
We'll keep one TV on
for news updates.

457
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:44,485
And please don't prioritize
charging your personal devices.

458
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,779
- We need the Internet, though.
- Yeah.

459
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:50,658
As far as we know,
the Internet is gone.

460
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:52,368
Right, Tyler?

461
00:31:54,203 --> 00:31:55,496
No more Internet.

462
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,331
- Oh.
- Oh.

463
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:58,958
The people who ran
the airport were planning

464
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:00,876
to install solar panels
on all the hangar roofs.

465
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,671
Now, I'm thinking,
between these

466
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:07,841
and all the old airplane
batteries we got in storage...

467
00:32:07,925 --> 00:32:09,969
we could really rig something.

468
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:15,516
- Really?
- A-and you know how to?

469
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,186
- Yeah.
- I'm impressed.

470
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:23,232
And, technically...

471
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:28,070
We could...

472
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:30,490
we could last forever.

473
00:32:32,408 --> 00:32:35,494
Mile... Miles, I...

474
00:32:35,578 --> 00:32:38,498
I'm sorry, I can't.

475
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:42,043
Well, why not?

476
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:45,838
I'm in mourning.

477
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:48,007
I had someone.

478
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:53,637

You're missing the party.

496
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:03,165
My hot spot stopped working.

497
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:06,126
This is the last thing
I downloaded.

498
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:08,629
What if I just deleted it?

499
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:14,468
I mean,
we'd just invent it again.

500
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:19,264
Sorry, can you just put
that away for a second?

501
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:25,479
Sorry.

502
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:32,361
Look, I-I think
that we both know

503
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:35,156
that these last years
in Germany, um...

504
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:43,747
What your father did
really hurt me.

505
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:51,714
I don't know what it is
about being here, but I...

506
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:54,091
I don't know, um...

507
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:58,512
It seems like maybe there's
something good happening...

508
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:00,264
with us.

509
00:35:04,393 --> 00:35:06,228
Am I crazy?

510
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:08,522
Do you feel it, too?

511
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:14,903
Maybe it's just
because Dad's dead.

512
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:33,922
He left you something.

513
00:35:34,006 --> 00:35:37,676
It's, uh... it's more a symbol
than anything,

514
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,554
but I had it in my bag, so...

515
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:47,144
The art's cool.

516
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:50,773
The MC on the cover
is for Miranda Carroll,

517
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:53,442
who was
your father's first wife.

518
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:57,196
I remember her.

519
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:03,702
He sent it to me, um,
a couple of weeks ago.

520
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:06,789
And I got it in the mail,
and I...

521
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:08,249
I kept it from you.

522
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:15,965
I-I've been doing that
for years.

523
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:22,262
He's been sending you letters
since the divorce,

524
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:24,598
and, uh...

525
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:27,977
I burn them.

526
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:36,986
Why?

527
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:42,783
Because I'm selfish.

528
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:30,039
Everything all right?

529
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:36,211
He can tell
when people are lying.

530
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:41,675
Well, what did you lie
to him about?

531
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:43,636
That Arthur kept trying.

532
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:51,894
Who wants some
jala-fucking-peño poppers?

533
00:39:57,603 --> 00:40:01,648
Two weeks feels
like an eternity here.

534
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:04,568
How so?

535
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:05,652
Well, you know...

536
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:11,158
No. I don't know.

537
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:12,492
Earlier...

538
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:14,036
Oh.

539
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,455
- Right.
- When you...

540
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:18,457
- Me?
- Mm.

541
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:21,918
Zombie!

542
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:28,216
- Tyler!
- Oh, my God!

543
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:31,887
Tyler, who's that man?

544
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:33,805
It's okay.

545
00:40:33,889 --> 00:40:34,514
He survived.

546
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:36,183
He was
on the Gitchegumee plane.

547
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:38,351
- Tyler, come here.
- Come here to me!

548
00:40:38,435 --> 00:40:39,895
- No. No.
- He's probably infected!

549
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:42,731
- He's not.
- He has to be immune.

550
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:45,317
He didn't get it,
but they all did.

551
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:47,652
This means there's
still people out there.

552
00:40:47,736 --> 00:40:50,781
- Tyler. Tyler, come here.
- Stop touching that man! Please!

553
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:52,449
- Look, please.
- P-please.

554
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:55,869
Miles, Miles,
what are you doing?

555
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:56,703
Put the gun down.

556
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:08,381
- What the fuck, Miles?
- Put the gun down! Put it down!

557
00:41:08,465 --> 00:41:10,842
- Jesus Christ!
- They're both infected now.

558
00:41:10,926 --> 00:41:11,885
Miles, put the gun down!

559
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:14,554
Elizabeth, I need you
to get outside right now.

560
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:16,056
- He's wasn't sick.
- He was immune.

561
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,307
We don't know
there is such a thing!

562
00:41:17,391 --> 00:41:18,725
Oh, it just got proven,
you idiot!

563
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:19,684
- What should I do?
- Take them out.

564
00:41:19,768 --> 00:41:23,063
Just get them out of here.

565
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:25,857
Garrett, shut the fuck up!

566
00:41:25,941 --> 00:41:29,069
We are not monsters!

567
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:30,862
Tell him to put the gun down.

568
00:41:30,946 --> 00:41:33,448
- Clark?
- Clark.

569
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:34,950
Um...

570
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:37,244
- we'll quarantine them.
- Fine. Quarantine.

571
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:40,330
Okay? The... the private plane
in Hangar G,

572
00:41:40,414 --> 00:41:43,291
the batteries work,
right, Miles?

573
00:41:43,375 --> 00:41:45,252
- Miles?
- Yeah.

574
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:47,838
- Okay, good. There'll be heat.
- There'll be food.

575
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:50,340
We'll keep them there
for a week, then we'll know.

576
00:41:50,424 --> 00:41:53,260
That's not enough.

577
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:55,220
We want our friends
back in our community.

578
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:56,596
A month, at least.

579
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,640
Clark...

580
00:41:58,724 --> 00:42:00,934
a week's not enough.

581
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:01,935
A month.

582
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:03,103
- A month?
- Yes.

583
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:04,563
- A month?
- Okay, yes.

584
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:05,897
- A month.
- Yeah.

585
00:42:05,981 --> 00:42:07,816
- Okay.
- That's a fair compromise.

586
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,317
- Fine, fine, a month.
- We're going.

587
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:11,444
We're going.
We're going.

588
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:24,583
"When your people go out
to battle their enemy,

589
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:25,792
by whatever way
you send them..."

590
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:28,378
- You did the right thing.
- "And they pray to the Lord.

591
00:42:28,462 --> 00:42:31,756
"Then hear in heaven
their prayer

592
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:34,635
and their pleading,
and maintain their cause."

593
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:39,389
"When they sin against you,

594
00:42:39,473 --> 00:42:43,143
"for there is no person
who does not sin,

595
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:44,436
"and you are angry with them

596
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:48,315
"and turn them over
to the enemy,

597
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:53,111
"if they repent and implore
your favor, saying,

598
00:42:53,195 --> 00:42:56,364
"'We have sinned
and done wrong.

599
00:42:56,448 --> 00:42:58,950
We have acted wickedly...'"

600
00:42:59,034 --> 00:43:01,745
You haven't looked up
from that thing in three weeks.

601
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:06,958
- There's no before.
- What are you doing?

602
00:43:07,042 --> 00:43:09,711
- There's no before.
- There's no before.

603
00:43:09,795 --> 00:43:11,630
There's no before.

604
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:16,760
"If they return to you
with all their heart

605
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:18,803
"and all their soul

606
00:43:18,887 --> 00:43:20,972
"in the land of their enemies

607
00:43:21,056 --> 00:43:23,392
who have taken them
captive"...

608
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:29,689
"Then hear their prayer
and their pleading in heaven,

609
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:31,775
your dwelling place..."

610
00:43:55,716 --> 00:43:57,384
Everything okay?

611
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:58,885
What are you wearing?

612
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:00,804
I, uh...

613
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:02,305
The folks inside

614
00:44:02,389 --> 00:44:03,223
said they'd feel
a little bit more comfortable

615
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:05,684
if you wore these, too.

616
00:44:07,394 --> 00:44:09,604
It's just for a little while.

617
00:44:09,688 --> 00:44:09,896
That okay?

618
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:15,860
I told you.

619
00:44:28,582 --> 00:44:31,835
How's that, Clark?

620
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:33,795
Perfect.

621
00:44:33,879 --> 00:44:37,173
"And forgive your people
who have sinned against you

622
00:44:37,257 --> 00:44:40,302
"and all their wrongdoings

623
00:44:40,386 --> 00:44:43,930
"which they have committed
against you.

624
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:46,683
"And make them objects
of compassion

625
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:50,729
"before those who have
taken them captive...

626
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:52,856
so that they will have
compassion on them."

627
00:44:57,194 --> 00:44:59,654
Let us pray.

628
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:11,249
- What are you doing?
- I'm making a museum...

629
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:14,002
A tribute
to the best of the old days,

630
00:45:14,086 --> 00:45:16,504
a reminder of how good
we used to have it...

631
00:45:16,588 --> 00:45:21,468
something to aim for,
to get back to.

632
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:25,764
Talking to the dead through
the radio system feels macabre.

633
00:45:25,848 --> 00:45:28,224
This will be better.

634
00:45:28,308 --> 00:45:30,268
He doesn't sleep.

635
00:45:30,352 --> 00:45:35,357
Since then, he was always...

636
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:37,609
confused about ghosts,

637
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:40,695
but this... this
has brought out something...

638
00:45:40,779 --> 00:45:42,531
else.

639
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:46,618
There was bullying in Berlin.

640
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:47,535
Tyler processed
the quarantine

641
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:52,040
as some kind
of personal humiliation.

642
00:45:52,124 --> 00:45:55,752
He needs to grow up
and get over it.

643
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:57,504
Do you hate Tyler
because you hated Arthur?

644
00:45:57,588 --> 00:46:00,465
I don't hate Tyler.

645
00:46:00,549 --> 00:46:01,925
But you did hate Arthur.

646
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:04,052
- Why?
- You think I was jealous of him?

647
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:05,762
Because that's what
he thought, too.

648
00:46:05,846 --> 00:46:09,182
I beat him out for Antonio
in "The Merchant of Venice."

649
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:11,351
And he
could never understand

650
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:13,937
the fact that I wasn't jealous.

651
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:14,896
Arthur was pathetic.

652
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:17,899
He was a B-list loser
who surrounded himself

653
00:46:17,983 --> 00:46:19,943
with C-list trophy duds
like yourself.

654
00:46:20,027 --> 00:46:21,528
Oh, yeah.

655
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:23,196
And he threw away
the only worthwhile wife

656
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,864
he had in Miranda,

657
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:27,033
who he never got over,
by the way.

658
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:30,829
He was a shit father,
a shit husband, which you know,

659
00:46:30,913 --> 00:46:33,748
and he died onstage
in a puddle of his own piss,

660
00:46:33,832 --> 00:46:36,126
desperate to be taken
seriously,

661
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:38,378
trying to do "King Lear."

662
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:41,590
And still, I loved him!

663
00:46:43,258 --> 00:46:45,093
Everyone loved him.

664
00:46:47,846 --> 00:46:50,056
I mean...

665
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:52,475
it takes every ounce
of your energy every day

666
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:55,895
to get people
to even like you...

667
00:46:55,979 --> 00:46:59,607
to actually listen
to the sentences that you say,

668
00:46:59,691 --> 00:47:01,443
but Art...

669
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:06,365
Art didn't have to try.

670
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:10,619
That must feel awful.

671
00:47:22,422 --> 00:47:25,258
Tyler will thrive here.

672
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:28,636
I haven't betrayed him, even
if you seem to think I have.

673
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:33,600
In fact, I saved his life
and yours.

674
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:36,811
We all know it was Arthur
who damaged Tyler.

675
00:47:36,895 --> 00:47:40,982
All of us, we're all
the fucking wreckage.

676
00:47:41,066 --> 00:47:41,858
- Yeah, you're right.
- You're right.

677
00:47:41,942 --> 00:47:44,277
Elizabeth, we have
to stick together.

678
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:48,281
We can't let a child play us
off against one another.

679
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:51,242
I, uh... I know.

680
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:33,076
Arthur?

681
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,953
Are you there?

682
00:48:36,663 --> 00:48:38,457
It's Clark.

683
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:45,547
I miss you, old friend...

684
00:48:45,631 --> 00:48:47,966
despite myself.

685
00:48:48,634 --> 00:48:52,845
Listen, I really regret...

686
00:48:52,929 --> 00:48:57,100
what I said the last time
we spoke...

687
00:48:57,184 --> 00:48:59,311
in Chicago.

688
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:05,484
I have tried
to protect your boy.

689
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:10,739
But I don't know
how to anymore.

690
00:49:12,949 --> 00:49:16,536
H-he's like you in his way...

691
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:21,374
Bold, indifferent to authority,

692
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:24,752
singular...

693
00:49:24,836 --> 00:49:27,005
but he's a destroyer.

694
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:31,926
And you were never a destroyer.

695
00:49:41,353 --> 00:49:45,148
I-I mean something here
to these people.

696
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:53,073
I've got responsibilities
to everybody now.

697
00:49:55,951 --> 00:49:59,412
And I don't think
I've done anything wrong.

698
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:07,170
But it's time for Tyler
and Elizabeth to go.

699
00:50:12,384 --> 00:50:14,594
Uncle Clark?

700
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:24,187
Tyler?

701
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:25,271
Where are you?

702
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:27,607
Were... were you...

703
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:29,734
Because I didn't mean...

704
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:31,444
I'm in the death.

705
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:45,917
Elizabeth.

706
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:48,461
Elizabeth!
Constance! Miles!

707
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:49,921
Who's down there?

708
00:50:50,005 --> 00:50:52,548
- I'm here. What is it?
- It's Tyler.

709
00:50:52,632 --> 00:50:54,300
He's on board the Gitchegumee.

710
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:57,387
Why?

711
00:50:57,471 --> 00:51:01,141
Tyler, what are you
doing on board that plane?

712
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:06,354
Setting all of you free.

713
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:09,482
Gate 105!

714
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:19,826
The jet is on fire.

715
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:21,703
He set it on fire!

716
00:51:21,787 --> 00:51:24,497
Tyler is still on board!

717
00:51:30,378 --> 00:51:33,464
Tyler!

718
00:51:35,383 --> 00:51:37,552
Tyler!

719
00:51:37,636 --> 00:51:39,303
Tyler!

720
00:51:39,387 --> 00:51:40,888
No!

721
00:51:40,972 --> 00:51:43,516
Tyler!

722
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:49,021
No, Tyler!

723
00:51:49,105 --> 00:51:50,648
Elizabeth...

724
00:51:50,732 --> 00:51:52,358
Tyler! No!

725
00:51:52,442 --> 00:51:55,278
Elizabeth...

726
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:57,029
No.

727
00:51:57,113 --> 00:51:58,448
Shh, shh, shh.

728
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:40,573
But soft, behold!

729
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:42,074
Lo, where it comes again!

730
00:52:42,158 --> 00:52:44,702
I'll cross it though
it blast me.

731
00:52:44,786 --> 00:52:47,622
Stay, illusion!

732
00:52:47,706 --> 00:52:52,460
If thou hast any sound
or use of voice, speak to me.

733
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:55,505
If there be any good thing
to be done

734
00:52:55,589 --> 00:53:00,468
that may to thee do ease
and grace to me, speak to me.

735
00:53:02,262 --> 00:53:04,180
If thou art privy
to thy country's fate,

736
00:53:04,264 --> 00:53:07,517
which happily foreknowing
may avoid, O, speak!

737
00:53:09,446 --> 00:53:11,603
Speak!

738
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:13,211
Speak!

738
00:53:14,305 --> 00:54:14,654
