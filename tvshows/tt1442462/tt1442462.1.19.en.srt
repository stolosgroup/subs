{231}{261}Your condition is your...
{261}{307}There is no condition!
{307}{343}I'll be damned|if I'm going to have
{343}{415}people think that Jonas Stern|is losing his mind.
{415}{442}You've done wrong.
{442}{470}I know I have.
{470}{499}Your marriage is in trouble
{499}{564}because you don't acknowledge|true repentance.
{564}{598}Tell me what I have to do.
{598}{649}I'm going to take a|third of your business,
{649}{721}and then I'm coming|back for the rest.
{804}{916}{Y:i}"At 5:16 p.m.|on September 5, the explosion hit.
{916}{962}{Y:i}"It was felt|over four blocks away.
{962}{1019}{Y:i}"Federal investigators|determined it was a pipe bomb
{1019}{1051}"consisting of ammonium nitrate
{1051}{1090}{Y:i}"and anhydrous|hydrazine nitrate,
{1090}{1128}{Y:i}"which had been thrown|through the window

{1180}{1217}{Y:i}"No culprits|were ever apprehended,
{1217}{1293}{Y:i}"and the federal government|continues to investigate.

{2028}{2115}and $100,000 from capped|renter's insurance""
{2115}{2181}But only if we agree now.
{2181}{2206}We agree.
{2207}{2276}Mrs. Sanborn?
{2276}{2332}Mrs. Sanborn?
{2352}{2438}The man|you're discussing--
{2438}{2464}my husband--
{2464}{2513}he was working on a novel.
{2513}{2547}I just started reading it.
{2547}{2645}It's... beautiful.
{2666}{2722}And you're telling me
{2722}{2851}that he's worth $350,000?
{2895}{3014}Mrs. Sanborn, no money could|ever replace your husband,
{3014}{3075}but the only way|we can talk here
{3075}{3121}is about money.
{3121}{3154}I'm sorry.
{3154}{3248}I've been reading a lot|of books about grief,
{3248}{3298}and they all suggest|waiting six months
{3298}{3364}before you make|any big changes in your life.
{3364}{3447}Well, Jeffrey died exactly
{3447}{3525}six months ago this week, so...
{3525}{3572}you're fired...
{3572}{3636}and you are, too.
{3636}{3735}Mrs. Sanborn, if you do this,|we have to start over,
{3735}{3795}and you may not get a better|settlement from our client.
{3796}{3831}I think I will.
{3831}{3876}Why?
{3876}{3902}Why do you think that?
{3902}{3956}Because I just hired|a new lawyer.
{3980}{4038}Jeanette!|Oh!
{4038}{4109}Oh, how I missed you, baby doll.
{4109}{4155}Ah, good to see you.
{4155}{4254}Hey, get out of this hellhole,|come work for a real law firm.
{4254}{4283}I have arrived.
{4283}{4354}Mr. Stern,|thank you for joining us.
{4354}{4460}Mrs. Sanborn, it is an extreme|and unconditional pleasure.
{4510}{4549}Hello, Julius.
{4549}{4620}I see you haven't|taken down the "S" yet.
{4620}{4656}We're looking for a new Stern.
{4656}{4686}Coffee, two sugars.
{4686}{4711}Thanks.
{4711}{4747}How about you three?|Anybody want coffee?
{4776}{4820}Ah, it'll just be one coffee.
{4820}{4884}How are you feeling, Mr. Stern?
{4906}{4961}How am I feeling, huh?
{4961}{5055}Well, I'm feeling|like amending a complaint.
{5055}{5100}How does that sound?|Jonas,
{5100}{5161}the insurance has been|capped at $350,000.
{5161}{5203}The newspaper can't|pay anymore.
{5203}{5263}Unless it was|an intentional act.
{5263}{5300}Intentional act opens you up
{5300}{5343}to punitive damages.
{5343}{5399}I love when she|talks like that.
{5399}{5445}It sounds so good coming|from a young person.
{5445}{5496}How is it an intentional act?
{5536}{5593}Your client published
{5593}{5655}an editorial cartoon|which depicts
{5655}{5696}the Prophet Muhammad|being humiliated.
{5696}{5765}Being body scanned|at an airport metal detector.
{5765}{5836}And while all the other white|passengers are waved through.
{5836}{5897}It was intended to criticize|racial profiling.
{5897}{5945}All the while, your client knew
{5945}{5980}that Islam prohibits
{5980}{6038}any pictorial depiction|of the Prophet,
{6038}{6098}and he cut back on security
{6098}{6136}at the exact moment|he should have increased it.
{6136}{6169}A cost-cutting measure.
{6169}{6201}Read the settlement, Jonas.
{6201}{6260}{Y:i}You know what happened in|Denmark when the Morning Post
{6260}{6322}published cartoons|just like this.
{6322}{6351}Riots,
{6351}{6377}death threats.
{6377}{6433}This isn't|about Mrs. Sanborn, Jonas.
{6433}{6464}This is about us.
{6464}{6547}Of course it's about us.
{6547}{6600}I'm going to destroy your firm.
{6624}{6661}And Mrs. Sanborn
{6661}{6724}understands that,|don't you, dear?
{6725}{6755}I do.
{6791}{6835}How much are you suing for?
{6835}{6884}Didn't I ask for coffee?
{6884}{6916}How much in punitive?
{6936}{6993}$25 million.
{6993}{7051}Here's the amended suit.
{7051}{7104}Mrs. Florrick.
{7121}{7177}May I have a moment?
{7245}{7279}How am I feeling?
{7279}{7360}It was an innocent question.
{7360}{7405}Attorney-client privilege.
{7405}{7506}What you know about me, what|you know about my condition
{7506}{7567}is for us to know|and no one else.
{7567}{7605}You do understand that?
{7637}{7707}Oh, there it is again.
{7732}{7762}That poker face.
{7762}{7832}You know, I always thought|the CIA could learn something
{7832}{7866}from the suburban housewife.
{7866}{7904}Do you understand?
{7905}{7928}I understand
{7928}{7978}the obligations of my job.
{7978}{8035}Good.
{8091}{8147}Oh, has your friend Will Gardner
{8147}{8177}stabbed you in the back yet?
{8177}{8207}Would you like me to get him
{8207}{8244}on the phone for you?|You can ask.
{8244}{8313}Ask him who he's|meeting with right now.
{8313}{8364}Or does the name Gerald Kozko
{8364}{8417}mean anything to you?
{8417}{8448}He's a real estate developer.
{8448}{8477}Underwater,
{8477}{8561}and unless I'm mistaken,|his name keeps coming up
{8561}{8615}in connection|with your husband's case.
{8669}{8745}Always a pleasure,|Mrs. Florrick.
{8770}{8920}Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.|Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
{9009}{9060}Well, it's never|about the money.
{9061}{9111}It's always about|something else.
{9111}{9145}Well, I'm sorry we can't help.
{9145}{9198}Take care.
{9233}{9281}Mrs. Florrick.
{9281}{9325}Mister...?
{9325}{9353}Kozko, Gerald.
{9353}{9413}We've never met.
{9413}{9453}How's Peter?
{9453}{9482}Fine.
{9482}{9509}I didn't know you knew Will.
{9509}{9537}I don't; I|was shopping
{9537}{9597}for more lawyers to|join my defense team,
{9597}{9664}but it appears we have|a conflict of interest--
{9664}{9703}you.
{9703}{9765}Anyway, glad to meet you.
{9765}{9823}Peter always said|he was a lucky guy.
{9823}{9888}Now I see why.
{9908}{9973}Would you tell Peter|something for me?
{9973}{10026}Tell him I'm sorry.
{10026}{10073}For?
{10073}{10141}He'll know what I mean.

{10547}{10581}{Y:i}My greater|Lucius Clay
{10581}{10630}{Y:i}founded the Vindicator.
{10630}{10683}In his first editorial|he endorsed Abraham Lincoln.
{10683}{10760}In his last he railed|against Prohibition.
{10760}{10797}{Y:i}The Trib and the Sun-Times
{10797}{10834}may be bigger,
{10834}{10882}but they have to answer|to corporate ownership.
{10882}{10927}Dumbwaiters.
{10927}{10975}Lucius set them up
{10975}{11013}to shuttle in the booze.
{11013}{11056}And so we gladly admit that
{11056}{11088}we have committed this attack
{11088}{11112}upon the blasphemous,
{11112}{11141}who published this cartoon,
{11141}{11165}to defend the honor
{11165}{11190}of all Muslims
{11190}{11226}and of Allah's beloved prophet.
{11226}{11257}Peace be upon him.
{11257}{11297}Yes, I've seen this.
{11297}{11323}How does it hurt us?
{11323}{11353}The plaintiff says|it's no secret
{11354}{11394}this group's been active|in Chicago.
{11394}{11421}Six months earlier,|they committed
{11421}{11473}an identical bombing|at a synagogue.
{11473}{11538}And you had to know that|cartoon might provoke them.
{11538}{11571}My job is to provoke.
{11571}{11598}Because it sells papers?
{11598}{11625}Because freedom of the press
{11625}{11707}is meaningless unless|somebody actually uses it.
{11750}{11817}I'm not trying|to be insensitive.
{11817}{11861}Jeff Sanborn was|a very good friend.
{11861}{11893}We came up together.
{11893}{11937}The problem, Mr. Clay,|is their argument is,
{11937}{11977}you did it|to increase circulation.
{11977}{12033}It's not like I commissioned|this cartoon,
{12034}{12087}hoping it was going|to anger Muslims.
{12087}{12168}We had an online contest-- best|political cartoon, any subject.
{12168}{12209}And you picked the cartoon?
{12209}{12253}In consultation with my editors.
{12254}{12323}Jeffrey Sanborn, too?
{12323}{12352}Sure,
{12352}{12384}of course.
{12384}{12433}{Y:i}So, even if Stern can show
{12433}{12472}he intended this to happen,
{12472}{12512}Sanborn was|contributorily negligent.
{12512}{12541}Might not be a total win,
{12541}{12577}but it's enough to get us|back to the table.
{12577}{12627}We'll need something more|than Mr. Clay's testimony
{12627}{12650}to establish it.
{12650}{12688}What about the cartoonist?
{12688}{12717}It was an anonymous submission.
{12717}{12758}I sent the money|to a Paypal account.
{12758}{12789}Routed through a proxy.
{12789}{12817}There's no way to trace it.
{12817}{12864}We'll see.|I'll get Kalinda on it.
{12864}{12913}♪ ♪
{13115}{13174}Returning to the|scene of the crime?
{13174}{13218}You're not going|to pout, are you?
{13218}{13295}I hate when men pout.
{13295}{13352}Go away.
{13418}{13482}Okay, let's inspect the|level of coincidence here.
{13482}{13523}I haven't seen you|since college.
{13523}{13557}We bump into each other here.
{13557}{13583}You ask me what I'm doing.
{13583}{13626}I talk about the|Muhammad cartoon case,
{13626}{13660}and then the next|day-- lo and behold--
{13660}{13708}you and your firm|are suing my client.
{13708}{13759}Cary, think about it.
{13759}{13818}If I let slip a piece|of information like that to you,
{13818}{13901}you'd be on the phone to your|boss before our second drink.
{13901}{13958}Okay.
{14041}{14065}Then your turn.
{14065}{14090}What's going on at work?
{14121}{14203}Okay, I'll play.
{14203}{14227}Stern wants you.
{14227}{14272}Stern wants me?
{14272}{14318}Last night you wanted|me, now he wants me.
{14318}{14366}Lockhart, Gardner|is going under.
{14366}{14417}It's a hollowed-out shell.
{14417}{14458}Because Stern keeps|taking our clients.
{14458}{14494}In one year, your firm
{14494}{14575}will be nothing but an empty|floor in an office building.
{14575}{14646}Stern's got equity,|plenty of business,
{14646}{14767}no contest.
{14799}{14909}That's right, your little|contest with Mrs. Florrick.
{14909}{14943}You're losing.
{14943}{14977}I got more billable hours.
{14977}{15033}And Florrick's got a name.
{15033}{15071}Stern is new.
{15071}{15139}There's a better path|to partnership.
{15139}{15203}Think about it.
{15203}{15236}You won't be alone.
{15236}{15287}Oh, I won't be alone?
{15287}{15336}In leaving Lockhart, Gardner.
{15336}{15367}You're raiding us?
{15367}{15403}Mm-hmm.
{15442}{15507}{Y:i}So where are we on|getting me to church?
{15507}{15534}I'm filing a|religious exception
{15534}{15569}to electronic monitoring.
{15569}{15642}It doesn't always work,|but we'll hope for the best.
{15642}{15673}Maybe next Sunday.
{15673}{15711}And I am getting a|photographer at the church.
{15711}{15762}I don't care|what the good pastor has to say.
{15762}{15814}Eli, we're not doing that.
{15861}{15886}What is it?
{15886}{15924}What's the mater?|Well, it's...
{15924}{15956}probably nothing.
{15956}{16034}Um, Childs is changing the|direction with the retrial.
{16034}{16086}He's giving up the sex angle.|What?
{16086}{16120}That's all he's got.
{16120}{16169}Is he changing the trial date?|No.
{16169}{16225}Two months away.|I don't understand, then.
{16225}{16309}I am hearing chatter|about a surprise witness.
{16309}{16365}So who can hurt you?
{16365}{16409}Well, if they're going to lie,
{16409}{16453}anybody can hurt me.
{16453}{16535}Maybe Childs is trying to|quietly make this disappear.
{16535}{16561}I doubt it.
{16561}{16613}Hey, hon.
{16640}{16705}Gerald Kozko was|at my office today.
{16754}{16825}He wanted me to tell you|something.
{16825}{16893}He said, "Tell Peter I'm sorry""
{16913}{16963}Damn.
{16963}{17014}No. Kozko and Childs|hate each other.
{17014}{17061}There's no way he's going|to grant him immunity.
{17061}{17117}Well, he would if it's|the only way to get Peter.
{17117}{17154}We need...
{17206}{17283}You're standing in my kitchen.
{17283}{17344}Whatever you have to say,|you can say it in front of me.
{17412}{17465}You heard her.
{17843}{17890}Mrs. Sanborn,
{17890}{17984}did your husband have a close|relationship with his employer?
{17984}{18031}Mr. Clay?
{18031}{18078}Yes. Until recently.
{18078}{18149}It had become strained--|their friendship.
{18149}{18182}And why was that?
{18182}{18218}Objection.|Beyond the scope.
{18218}{18297}Well, I really think|we're safe here.
{18297}{18345}Don't you?
{18345}{18378}You may answer, Mrs. Sanborn.
{18378}{18445}The paper was|in financial trouble.
{18445}{18495}They had to lay off|a lot of staff.
{18495}{18536}The stress took its toll.
{18536}{18608}Jeff was also frustrated|by Mr. Clay's pursuit
{18608}{18647}{Y:i}of a New Yorker cover.
{18647}{18691}Something controversial.
{18691}{18764}{Y:i}Like the Obama fist-bump cartoon|on the New Yorker.
{18764}{18809}Something that would|increase readership.
{18809}{18879}Well, Mrs. Sanborn,|did your husband help
{18879}{18955}Mr. Clay choose the cartoon|for publication in the paper?
{18955}{18985}Yes.
{18985}{19041}It was a contest, and he helped|Mr. Clay judge it.
{19041}{19092}But the cartoon that appeared|was different,
{19092}{19120}wasn't it?|Yes.
{19120}{19146}I saw the original.
{19146}{19193}It didn't depict Muhammad.
{19193}{19240}It was just|a Middle-Eastern man.
{19240}{19284}Jeffrey told me
{19284}{19376}that the decision to change it|to Muhammad was Mr. Clay's.
{19403}{19468}To generate more controversy.
{19468}{19495}Is it just me,
{19495}{19580}or do we really need|to find that cartoonist?
{19580}{19622}So, here's your cartoon.
{19622}{19661}Now, you see this|cross-hatching?
{19661}{19695}How it almost looks like bars?
{19695}{19751}That can indicate a|sense of suffocation.
{19751}{19785}Like they can't say|what they mean.
{19786}{19816}In this case, it might indicate
{19816}{19887}someone who's a|Muslim themselves.
{19887}{19938}Fascinating.|Yeah.
{19938}{19970}Does this really work?
{19970}{20012}Graphology?
{20012}{20040}Applied to drawing.
{20040}{20111}It does if you know|what you're looking for.
{20111}{20175}You don't respect|my job, do you?
{20175}{20222}I am... incredulous.
{20222}{20258}It's best with comparison.
{20258}{20306}You run an image search,|cross-referenced
{20306}{20367}with the unique elements|of the sample drawing.
{20367}{20430}Still too much.
{20430}{20478}Narrow it by location.
{20478}{20509}Chicago.
{20509}{20562}Better.
{20610}{20656}Mm.
{20742}{20783}Wow.
{20783}{20817}Looks like I am a believer.
{20817}{20889}The thing is,|when you hired me,
{20889}{20938}I was told the|firm had a program
{20938}{20987}for lending associates money|against our salaries--
{20987}{21038}for down payments, cars.
{21038}{21064}Accounting turned you down?|Yeah.
{21064}{21114}And I got my eye on a|condo in Lincoln Park.
{21114}{21147}Interest rates are still low.
{21147}{21219}Look, money's a little tight|these days, that's all.
{21219}{21247}Yeah, I just want to know
{21247}{21281}if there's anything|I should be aware of.
{21281}{21328}About my future.|About your...?
{21328}{21355}No.
{21355}{21401}Nobody's trying|to tell you anything.
{21401}{21430}It's just money's tight.
{21430}{21476}So I'm still in the running?
{21476}{21506}You are.
{21506}{21548}Nobody's made any decisions yet.
{21591}{21620}Is that it?
{21640}{21679}Yes.
{21837}{21886}So how's Peter doing?
{21886}{21937}He's good.|I mean, he'd be a lot better
{21937}{22009}if he had a clearer sense|of what Childs was planning.
{22009}{22064}So, he got the message?
{22064}{22098}My apology?|Yeah.
{22098}{22152}Look, you and Peter|go back a long way.
{22152}{22187}If Childs is threatening you,
{22187}{22248}Peter wants to help his friends|in any way he can.
{22248}{22290}Well, I don't want|to hurt Peter.
{22290}{22321}But it's not just me.
{22321}{22377}I have a legacy to protect.
{22377}{22419}My son.
{22419}{22474}Peter has a family, too.
{22474}{22500}We all have families.
{22500}{22537}Okay, let's cut|the pleasantries.
{22537}{22612}Whatever you have, or think|you can devise, to hurt Peter--
{22612}{22660}he has twice as much|to hurt you.
{22660}{22738}I know your reputation,|Mr. Gold.
{22738}{22778}Then you know|I don't screw around.
{22778}{22814}I know Peter has religion.
{22835}{22883}Meaning?
{22904}{22947}He's off his game.
{23024}{23106}You have a pastor giving him|spiritual instruction.
{23106}{23154}Now he's going to church.
{23154}{23212}Hey, I'm in risk|assessment, Mr. Gold.
{23212}{23264}At the moment, Childs|is the bigger risk.
{23264}{23310}Did he give you immunity?
{23420}{23467}Oh, that's not good.
{23467}{23526}Not at all.
{23653}{23685}{Y:i}We don't threaten
{23685}{23743}with a subpoena unless|he refuses to testify.
{23743}{23814}How about we don't|threaten at all?
{23814}{23860}Yes?
{23860}{23883}Mrs. Bassir?
{23883}{23909}Dr. Bassir.
{23909}{23930}May I help you?
{23930}{23961}Oh, so sorry.|Yes, of course.
{23961}{23995}Um, is your husband home?
{23995}{24045}My husband?
{24045}{24079}My husband doesn't live|in this country.
{24079}{24125}Is there a Tarik Bassir here?
{24125}{24153}A cartoonist?
{24153}{24202}Yeah, that's me.
{24202}{24237}What's up?
{24237}{24272}Yeah, it was my idea.
{24272}{24322}Some jerk at the airport|gave me a hard time,
{24322}{24351}so I drew about it.
{24351}{24389}First I made it just a picture|of a random Muslim.
{24389}{24438}Then I thought--|what the hell?
{24438}{24472}Language.
{24472}{24519}I mean, if I'm going|to make a statement,
{24519}{24566}why not really make|a statement, you know?
{24566}{24637}{Y:i}So it was your idea to depict...|The Prophet.
{24637}{24703}Yeah. Somebody has to do|something or the Fundies win.
{24703}{24727}The...
{24727}{24767}Fundamentalists.|I e-mailed Clay,
{24767}{24808}told him I wanted|to change the cartoon.
{24808}{24857}Put it out in the open,|get other Muslims
{24857}{24900}to reexamine|their preconceptions.
{24900}{24941}Then why do it anonymously?
{24941}{24984}Hey, I'm 15 years old.
{24984}{25016}Why do I do anything?
{25016}{25045}You have to understand--
{25046}{25101}I knew nothing|about any of this.
{25101}{25130}Not until after.
{25130}{25160}And would you be willing
{25160}{25196}to testify about|all of this, Tarik?
{25196}{25231}That's not up to Tarik.
{25231}{25289}Well, he could testify|in camera--
{25289}{25313}in the judge's chambers.
{25313}{25341}There would only be the judge,
{25341}{25379}the lawyers, the|court reporters.
{25379}{25426}We would use a pseudonym.
{25426}{25486}Mrs. Florrick, Miss Sharma,
{25486}{25558}I know the name|of only one cartoonist.
{25558}{25606}Kurt Westergaard,
{25606}{25654}the man who drew one
{25654}{25679}of the cartoons of Muhammad
{25679}{25719}in the Danish paper|five years ago.
{25719}{25757}And he has been living
{25757}{25813}under 24-hour security|since then.
{25813}{25889}I will not do that to my son.
{25917}{25979}You explained|he could testify in camera?
{25979}{26024}Yes. She doesn't|want to take a chance.
{26024}{26064}Well, if she|doesn't produce him,
{26064}{26094}she'll be held in contempt.
{26094}{26119}No.
{26119}{26174}Uh, we need him.
{26174}{26215}He is the only one|who can corroborate
{26215}{26299}the cartoon was|his idea, not yours.
{26299}{26375}I already have Jeff Sanborn's|blood on my hands.
{26375}{26422}I won't have this kid's.
{26422}{26483}This kid is all|we have, Charles.
{26596}{26673}If we don't use him, we need|an alternate story for the jury.
{26673}{26719}Counterterrorism|unit just finished
{26719}{26759}its preliminary bombing report.
{26759}{26809}Maybe there's something|we overlooked.
{26809}{26858}Can you get your hands on it?
{26858}{26909}I can try.
{26961}{27012}{Y:i}If I leave Lockhart/Gardner,
{27012}{27076}I don't want it to be a dozen|junior associates and me.
{27076}{27110}It won't be.
{27110}{27160}We've got an equity partner.
{27160}{27210}Ten associates.
{27240}{27277}You got an equity partner?
{27278}{27369}There's a lot of unhappiness|at Lockhart/Gardner.
{27369}{27422}Which one?
{27454}{27495}I like your hair messy.
{27495}{27523}Don't comb it, okay?
{27523}{27607}Ten litigators,|an unhappy equity partner.
{27607}{27678}It's Julius, isn't it?
{27678}{27764}He was always close to Stern.
{27764}{27846}You are a smart boy.
{28098}{28150}He tried to poach you?
{28150}{28179}Stern did?
{28179}{28214}Yes.
{28214}{28270}And 11 others.
{28270}{28318}Who?
{28318}{28379}The only name I know|is Julius Cain.
{28435}{28477}I don't want you to think|for one moment
{28477}{28514}I was considering taking it.
{28514}{28560}Of course not.
{28560}{28590}I'm a team player.
{28590}{28658}I just want to do what's|right for the firm.
{28703}{28749}Thanks, Cary.
{28749}{28791}Yeah.
{28861}{28902}Oh.
{28902}{28957}I'm working on your loan.
{28958}{29009}I think we can make it work.
{29009}{29054}Thanks.
{29054}{29101}I really appreciate that.
{29101}{29138}{Y:i}Yes, I was at the Vindicator
{29138}{29189}when Mr. Clay made the decision|to publish the cartoon.
{29189}{29245}And did you argue against it?|I did.
{29246}{29318}I felt it was insensitive|to Muslim believers,
{29318}{29368}especially when the same point|could be made
{29368}{29394}without depicting Muhammad.
{29394}{29474}You also argued|that it was reckless.
{29474}{29533}I was the reporter|on the synagogue bombing.
{29533}{29602}I saw the devastation|that caused.
{29602}{29650}Mr. Thiessen,|were you present
{29650}{29680}when Mr. Clay met
{29680}{29725}{Y:i}with the Vindicator lawyer|prior to the publication
{29725}{29764}of the cartoon?
{29764}{29801}Objection, Your Honor!|Attorney-client privilege.
{29801}{29878}Mr. Thiessen observed|the conversation, Your Honor,
{29878}{29953}and is not covered|by the privilege.
{29953}{30014}That makes sense to me.
{30014}{30045}Doesn't it, Ms. Lockhart?
{30045}{30073}I'll allow.
{30073}{30132}What was said at this meeting?
{30132}{30181}{Y:i}The lawyer referenced|the New York Times
{30181}{30209}and Yale University Press
{30209}{30251}decision not to reprint|the Danish cartoon.
{30251}{30307}He believed, in both cases,
{30307}{30353}the fear of inciting violence
{30353}{30392}trumped the public's|need to know.
{30392}{30426}Thank you, sir.
{30514}{30557}Mr. Thiessen, you were worried
{30557}{30610}that the paper would|be insensitive
{30610}{30673}to religious believers|by printing the cartoon?
{30673}{30697}Yes.
{30697}{30754}I'm not a Muslim myself,|but I can sympathize.
{30754}{30807}And what is this?
{30897}{30953}"Piss Christ."
{30977}{31013}I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.
{31013}{31061}"Piss... Christ."
{31061}{31132}Yes, an artwork|depicting a crucifix
{31132}{31209}placed in a cup of urine.
{31209}{31277}This photo illustrated|an article of yours
{31277}{31322}on controversial art?
{31322}{31352}My goodness.
{31352}{31417}Why not the same sensitivity|to religious believers?
{31417}{31506}{Y:i}Because that|is unlikely to incite violence.
{31506}{31590}So, it's not about sensitivity,|it's about fear?
{31590}{31617}It's about both.
{31617}{31665}Mm-hmm. You were fired
{31665}{31713}{Y:i}from the Vindicator,|weren't you, Mr. Thiessen,
{31713}{31763}as part of Mr. Clay's|cost-cutting?
{31763}{31849}Yes. But that has nothing|to do with my testimony.
{32017}{32049}Who are you?
{32049}{32109}The plumber. Who are you?
{32109}{32173}I'm Jackie.
{32193}{32238}That means nothing to me.
{32238}{32277}Peter's mother.
{32277}{32321}Oh, yes, of course.
{32321}{32377}Mrs. Florrick.|I'm... I'm Eli Gold.
{32377}{32432}Please, come on in.
{32585}{32642}You're not the plumber.
{32642}{32682}No.
{32682}{32756}I'm Peter's, uh,|image consultant.
{32756}{32806}Call me Eli.
{32874}{32909}I like that brooch.
{32909}{32959}Thank you. Where's my son?
{32959}{33007}He's just...
{33051}{33129}He's meeting with his pastor.
{33150}{33177}His...
{33177}{33229}Pastor.
{33258}{33305}But please go in.
{33305}{33361}I'm sure they'd|love to say hello.
{33645}{33702}Yeah,|it was good.
{33702}{33774}We had a guide and a porter.
{33774}{33856}And his sister was there.
{33900}{33971}They've been meeting|once a week for prayer,
{33971}{34025}spiritual guidance...
{34025}{34096}and the sharing|of Jesus Christ.
{34096}{34143}Who is that man?
{34143}{34181}Isaiah Easton,
{34181}{34244}pastor at Lord|in Christ Church.
{34244}{34284}On 95th?
{34284}{34332}Yes.
{34332}{34377}Southside.
{34451}{34515}There is something|in the FBI report.
{34515}{34615}The theory is that the bomb was|tossed in through the window.
{34615}{34670}Just like the synagogue.|Yeah.
{34670}{34728}But all the windows|were blown out by the force
{34728}{34757}of the blast.
{34757}{34802}So?|So there's no way to tell
{34802}{34854}if the bomb was|tossed in or not.
{34854}{34896}That's the blast site.
{34896}{34959}You remember what Clay said?
{34959}{35052}Those dumbwaiters they used during|Prohibition to haul the liquor up--
{35052}{35087}they're all over the place.
{35087}{35138}{Y:i}So, this is the access
{35138}{35166}to the office dumbwaiter.
{35166}{35210}Well, the blast blew it apart.
{35210}{35287}It doesn't mean it|went up this way.
{35425}{35471}What?
{35471}{35525}What is it?
{35548}{35610}Kalinda, words.
{35654}{35702}The bomb was hydrogen nitrate,
{35702}{35735}a liquid explosive,
{35735}{35797}and it stains|concrete, not tile.
{35797}{35867}How do you know that?|Looked it up.
{35892}{35928}Look.
{35928}{36003}The stain splattered here...
{36003}{36040}not here.
{36040}{36076}Concrete, not tile.
{36076}{36132}Well, it could have|come down the shaft
{36132}{36165}from the blast.
{36165}{36194}Not in liquid form.
{36194}{36242}So, what are you saying,
{36242}{36273}someone mixed the bomb here
{36273}{36330}and raised it...|on the dumbwaiter?
{36330}{36379}I'm not saying anything;|I'm just staring
{36379}{36414}at a stain.
{36414}{36476}But if the bomb|was mixed here...
{36476}{36530}we're talking|about an inside job.
{36707}{36752}The waiter,
{36752}{36803}so there was no evidence|that it was even there.
{36803}{36838}Should I bring|Julius in on this?
{36838}{36878}No, not yet.|We'll update him later.
{36878}{36960}I still don't understand|how the Feds missed this.
{36960}{37010}Well, my guess is, they didn't.
{37010}{37042}Their investigation|is still open.
{37042}{37075}They just didn't issue|any of their findings.
{37075}{37110}And they won't until they catch
{37110}{37139}whoever's responsible.
{37139}{37173}Cary.
{37174}{37204}Come on in.
{37204}{37249}The question is,|what does it mean?
{37249}{37332}Well, Stern's theory is that|Clay wanted a violent backlash.
{37332}{37403}That rests on the fact that|he cut back security.
{37403}{37442}Yeah, but if the bomb|came from inside,
{37442}{37489}no security would've been|able to prevent it. Right.
{37489}{37540}Stern will still argue|that the bomb was planted
{37540}{37569}by a radical Islamic group.
{37569}{37610}They just had help from inside.
{37610}{37645}So talk to the employees.
{37645}{37676}That could help.
{37676}{37723}A lone bomber in the office.
{37723}{37772}How many Muslim|employees does he have?
{37772}{37810}Can't be many.
{37810}{37860}So we're going to|racially profile?
{37860}{37913}The exact thing|the cartoon was against.
{37913}{37955}No. We're gonna|step nicely
{37955}{38034}past the ironies|and defend our client.
{38034}{38100}Go over the employees|for the last five years.
{38100}{38132}Okay.
{38213}{38254}Shall we?
{38354}{38423}Julius, can we talk|to you for a second?
{38423}{38461}What's that about?
{38551}{38600}It's a betrayal.
{38600}{38645}It's a business decision.
{38645}{38670}What happened to loyalty?
{38670}{38738}It exited the building|the day you fired
{38738}{38802}half of tax litigation.
{38802}{38844}Look...
{38844}{38915}I really didn't want it|to get back to you this way,
{38915}{38962}but, uh, it's no secret|this place is
{38962}{38988}going through|financial troubles.
{38988}{39045}Half of which is|Stern's fault, Julius.
{39045}{39096}There was trouble before Stern
{39096}{39138}started to take clients.
{39138}{39203}Right now his firm|seems more stable,
{39203}{39262}and I consider him a mentor.|- So do I.
{39262}{39331}But at the end of the day,|I bet on myself, not him.
{39331}{39369}With Stern,|it's all about Stern.
{39501}{39557}I'm sorry.
{39557}{39595}Julius.
{39595}{39662}You're one of the best|lawyers we have.
{39662}{39701}You have a great client list.
{39734}{39786}So what's it gonna take?
{39866}{39937}Here's my offer from Stern.
{40098}{40146}We can match it.
{40245}{40308}What about, uh, gearing up
{40308}{40354}that diversity program|we keep talking about?
{40354}{40413}That'll cost us money|we don't have.
{40413}{40476}We lag behind virtually|every other major Chicago firm
{40476}{40508}in diversity hiring.
{40508}{40555}I'm tired of being|the poster boy
{40555}{40593}for affirmative|action around here.
{40593}{40635}Okay, fine.
{40635}{40690}We'll find the money.
{40723}{40762}All right.
{40900}{40951}Now, it's your turn
{40951}{40992}to do something for us.
{40992}{41059}Ten other lawyers|who were gonna go with you--...
{41081}{41124}...their names.
{41162}{41230}What, you want me to...
{41230}{41278}But now they'll stay.
{41278}{41328}Stern wanted me, not them.
{41328}{41355}We don't want turncoats
{41355}{41406}with access|to proprietary information.
{41406}{41464}You're gonna fire them.
{41464}{41527}It's more money|for diversity hiring.
{41613}{41659}Write down the names.
{41815}{41866}What is that?|The results
{41866}{41903}of my questioning|the employees.
{41903}{41927}One received that
{41927}{41960}the week before the attack.
{41960}{42001}Tell they didn't|take this to Clay.
{42001}{42057}They took it to Clay.|And he ignored it?
{42057}{42103}Yes.|Which makes it even worse
{42103}{42146}that it was an inside job.
{42146}{42242}Clay isn't liable for unforeseeable|acts of his employees.
{42242}{42295}But now? If he|had prior notice?
{42295}{42349}If we know this,|Stern knows this.
{42349}{42391}Oh, well, that's|a happy thought.
{42391}{42429}That's me, Mr. Cheer.
{42429}{42463}Well, it makes Clay's|questioning tomorrow
{42463}{42505}that much more important.
{42505}{42558}Oh. Which brings up|another problem.
{42558}{42587}Julius was
{42587}{42615}handling questioning.
{42615}{42660}Why is that a problem?
{42660}{42706}Maybe Cary should take it.
{42706}{42766}No. Alicia.
{42766}{42831}She can get in Stern's|face more effectively.
{42916}{42994}The fact is, you know something|about Stern no one else knows.
{42994}{43030}I can't use it, Kalinda.
{43030}{43064}You can't not use it.
{43064}{43118}It violates attorney-client|privilege.
{43118}{43216}Only if you tell someone,|so don't tell someone.
{43250}{43280}All right, see you, then.
{43344}{43423}I want you to meet|Bishop Grayson.
{43423}{43460}Mom.
{43460}{43500}He's a nice Episcopalian priest.
{43500}{43581}He will help you put this|religion stuff into perspective.
{43581}{43649}It is in perspective.|That's not perspective.
{43671}{43722}This is about Alicia, isn't it?
{43723}{43749}No.
{43749}{43801}No, it's not.|It's about me.
{43801}{43840}And I need a change.
{43840}{43890}No, you don't, Peter.
{43891}{43937}You are a good man.
{43937}{43985}You want to blame yourself.
{43985}{44032}But you apologized.
{44032}{44089}You apologized again, and again.
{44089}{44159}Anybody who wants another|apology from you
{44159}{44208}only wants you to be weak.
{44208}{44234}So stop this.
{44234}{44294}Stop this now.
{44295}{44365}My son will not be made weak.
{44528}{44580}You are one scary mom.
{44603}{44686}Yes. And you are|a good son.
{44756}{44806}{Y:i}Mrs. Sanborn stated
{44806}{44854}under oath that|it was your decision
{44855}{44918}to have the cartoon depict|the Prophet Muhammad.
{44918}{44962}That's untrue.
{44962}{45007}The cartoonist contacted me
{45007}{45043}with that idea.
{45043}{45072}Still,
{45072}{45133}it was your decision|to run the cartoon, Mr. Clay.
{45133}{45158}Why did you?
{45158}{45209}'Cause it was newsworthy.
{45209}{45251}It wasn't sensational.
{45251}{45294}And this is America--
{45294}{45335}we can handle it.
{45335}{45383}Thank you.
{45383}{45418}Mr. Clay,
{45418}{45496}what is The Naked Columnist?
{45541}{45600}An advice columnist in my paper
{45600}{45693}who supposedly answers|questions in the nude.
{45693}{45725}And that is newsworthy.
{45725}{45759}That's not sensational.
{45759}{45791}It is not on the front page.
{45791}{45819}And this is America.
{45819}{45849}We can handle it.
{45849}{45907}The Naked... Columnist.
{45907}{45953}There's room for entertainment
{45953}{45983}in every paper.
{45983}{46020}A lot of room, apparently.
{46020}{46091}You devoted 10,000|column inches
{46091}{46147}to The Naked|Columnist last year.
{46147}{46198}Do you know how many|you devoted to Iraq?
{46198}{46265}I'm battling Internet|competitors, sir.
{46265}{46344}Competitors who are willing to|give away their product for free.
{46344}{46457}Mr. Clay, are you aware|that the police now believe
{46457}{46493}that this bombing was
{46493}{46517}an inside job?
{46517}{46578}Objection!|Not in evidence. Yes.
{46578}{46666}Your Honor, this is|plaintiff's exhibit N--
{46666}{46722}the police report...
{46722}{46757}filed...
{46757}{46817}yesterday morning.
{46894}{46934}Mr. Clay, you don't know
{46934}{46960}anything about this, do you?
{46960}{46993}Objection!|Argumentative.
{46993}{47053}Uh, Your Honor, it's a|simple leading question.
{47053}{47082}Overruled.
{47082}{47119}Um, you may answer.
{47119}{47179}I'm sorry,|wh-what was the question?
{47179}{47245}The question was, uh...
{47245}{47292}The police
{47292}{47387}now believe that the bombing|was an inside job, that the bomb
{47387}{47463}was hoisted up through a dumbwaiter.|Objection! Again,
{47463}{47511}{Y:i}not in evidence.|It is in
{47511}{47543}the investigative report.
{47543}{47587}The investigative report|merely states
{47587}{47649}that it appears|a bomb was planted from inside.
{47649}{47686}It doesn't say|anything specifically
{47686}{47712}about dumbwaiters.
{47712}{47739}We ask that statement
{47739}{47768}be stricken from the record.
{47768}{47799}Is that really necessary,
{47799}{47823}Mrs. Florrick?
{47823}{47856}Overruled.
{47876}{47912}Thank you, Your Honor.
{47912}{47971}Uh...
{47971}{48012}Ugh.
{48012}{48058}Where was I?
{48058}{48100}Uh, right, right.
{48100}{48128}Dumbwaiter, employees.
{48128}{48160}So, Mr. Clay,
{48160}{48202}have any of the employees
{48202}{48255}approached you about threats|they might have been receiv...?
{48255}{48283}Objection.|Overly vague.
{48283}{48308}Mrs. Florrick.
{48308}{48335}You're right.
{48335}{48364}Withdrawn, Your Honor.
{48364}{48427}You may proceed, Mr. Stern.
{48427}{48495}Yes. Thank you, Your Honor.
{48520}{48607}Um... One moment.
{48656}{48681}Mr. Stern?
{48681}{48710}Yes. Just-just
{48710}{48738}one moment, please. Thank you.
{48739}{48765}Inside job.
{48765}{48806}The threat.|A threat.
{48807}{48838}Mr. Stern.|The documents. No, no.
{48839}{48886}Do you have any further|questions for this witness?
{48886}{48921}Damn it, give me a minute!
{49029}{49089}Oh.
{49089}{49137}I am sorry, Your Honor.
{49137}{49195}I... I just, uh...
{49222}{49296}I, um...
{49395}{49445}I have nothing further.
{49550}{49612}Thank you, Mr. Clay.
{49612}{49650}You are dismissed.
{49650}{49702}Please refrain from|speaking with the jury
{49702}{49778}and make yourself available|for further questions.
{49778}{49822}At this time,
{49822}{49894}I suggest a, uh,|a ten-minute recess.
{50067}{50095}{Y:i}We're still|treating this
{50095}{50149}like jihad even though|it's an inside job.
{50149}{50194}Because of the|threat. The bomb?
{50194}{50233}Look.
{50262}{50326}You were talking about|racial profiling, right?
{50326}{50371}What if someone|was using our bias
{50371}{50413}to make us think it was jihad
{50413}{50482}when it was really|something else?
{50482}{50519}Okay.
{50519}{50554}I'm listening.
{50554}{50618}And...
{50668}{50709}That's all I got.
{50709}{50774}I didn't say I was|solving something.
{50774}{50820}I just said I|didn't understand.
{50894}{50936}I want credit for it.
{50936}{50994}Whatever you get,|I want credit.
{50994}{51050}Hmm. Whatever.
{51050}{51122}Mr.|Thiessen, you covered the bombing
{51122}{51150}at the Oak Lawn synagogue?
{51150}{51182}That's right.|And it's
{51182}{51214}your opinion that this bomb
{51214}{51249}was very similar to that one?
{51249}{51281}Identical.
{51281}{51308}In both cases,
{51308}{51340}the device was fashioned|from a metal canister,
{51340}{51390}densely packed with hydrazine
{51390}{51434}nitrate explosive and a
{51434}{51470}simple,|remote-triggered circuit.
{51470}{51522}But this utilized a different|triggering mechanism
{51522}{51552}than the synagogue bombing?
{51552}{51583}No, no.
{51583}{51623}It was identical.
{51623}{51672}A modified flashbulb?
{51672}{51702}Yes, from a camera.
{51702}{51733}It's quite clever.
{51733}{51773}It produces just enough flame|to trigger the fuse.
{51773}{51826}Oh, that's interesting.
{51826}{51871}But when you reported|on the synagogue bombing,
{51871}{51904}you never mentioned that fact.
{51904}{51954}It's kind of|a technical detail.
{51954}{52014}A little beyond the scope|of a basic news article.
{52014}{52048}Of course.
{52048}{52080}It's just that
{52080}{52124}whoever planted the|bomb at the Vindicator
{52124}{52173}had to know the layout|of the building,
{52173}{52246}the dumbwaiters,|Mr. Sanborn's schedule,
{52246}{52274}and how to build a bomb
{52274}{52332}exactly like|the Defenders of Allah's.
{52332}{52360}Objection, Your Honor!
{52360}{52388}Objection?
{52388}{52422}There hasn't been|a question yet.
{52422}{52470}Overruled.
{52470}{52531}And if you never reported|on the triggering mechanism,
{52531}{52599}Mr. Thiessen,|the only person I can think of
{52599}{52654}who possesses all|of that knowledge would be you.
{52654}{52698}Objection, Your Honor.
{52698}{52743}This is completely|without basis.
{52743}{52788}Yes, I'm afraid you're right.
{52788}{52837}I have to sustain|that objection.
{52837}{52869}Well, that's okay,
{52869}{52896}Your Honor.
