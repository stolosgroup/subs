Hello, Wilk Hobson.

74
00:02:46,177 --> 00:02:48,011
I'm so sorry about
your client's loss.

75
00:02:48,012 --> 00:02:49,947
Yes, but not
sorry enough to pay out

76
00:02:49,948 --> 00:02:51,181
her life insurance policy.

77
00:02:51,182 --> 00:02:53,183
My client, Wolf & Bland,
has some questions

78
00:02:53,184 --> 00:02:55,052
about the untimely death.

79
00:02:55,053 --> 00:02:56,286
Justice Ludwig
died in a car accident.

80
00:02:56,287 --> 00:02:58,121
I'm not sure how much
more "Accidental" it gets.

81
00:02:58,122 --> 00:02:59,089
Justice Ludwig was talking

82
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:00,990
on his cell
phone while driving

83
00:03:00,991 --> 00:03:03,593
and his car wasn't
Bluetooth enabled.

84
00:03:03,594 --> 00:03:05,462
Which isn't required
in Illinois.

85
00:03:05,463 --> 00:03:06,830
It speaks
to recklessness.

86
00:03:06,831 --> 00:03:09,499
Which is specifically
excluded from his policy.

87
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,268
Which might be relevant,
had he been hang gliding.

88
00:03:12,269 --> 00:03:14,637
Wolf & Bland believes
the coroner's inquest

89
00:03:14,638 --> 00:03:16,005
will find in our favor,

90
00:03:16,006 --> 00:03:18,273
but we're willing
to pay ten percent

91
00:03:18,274 --> 00:03:19,641
to avoid the uncertainty.

92
00:03:19,642 --> 00:03:21,309
$200,000,
how's that sound?

93
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:23,579
On a $2 million policy?

94
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,213
(Chuckling):
No, thanks.

95
00:03:25,214 --> 00:03:27,416
Ha-ha, more than usual.

96
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:30,452
Yeah, most people
have trouble finding us

97
00:03:30,453 --> 00:03:31,720
down here in the basement.

98
00:03:32,471 --> 00:03:35,122
I'm, uh, sorry
for the cold in here.

99
00:03:35,123 --> 00:03:38,325
That's the way we ride
in the coroner's office.

100
00:03:38,326 --> 00:03:41,195
This is an inquest
as to the cause of the death

101
00:03:41,196 --> 00:03:43,830
of Illinois Supreme
Court Justice

102
00:03:43,831 --> 00:03:45,299
Roger Ludwig.

103
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:48,435
Case file 591-R.

104
00:03:48,936 --> 00:03:53,206
Six jurors have been seated
from the regular jury pool.

105
00:03:53,207 --> 00:03:54,408
Welcome.

106
00:03:55,409 --> 00:03:57,343
I want to
stress that this

107
00:03:57,344 --> 00:03:58,978
is not a regular trial.

108
00:03:58,979 --> 00:04:03,216
Now, an inquest is merely
a fact-finding proceeding

109
00:04:03,217 --> 00:04:04,817
to answer the question:

110
00:04:04,818 --> 00:04:08,821
What is the cause and
the manner of death?

111
00:04:08,822 --> 00:04:12,391
So, uh, I will call
our first witness.

112
00:04:12,392 --> 00:04:14,427
The immediate cause of death:

113
00:04:14,428 --> 00:04:15,394
Bleeding and trauma,

114
00:04:15,395 --> 00:04:16,495
due to massive
internal injuries.

115
00:04:16,496 --> 00:04:19,264
Can you tell us
what, if any, substances

116
00:04:19,265 --> 00:04:21,466
you found in
the decedent's system?

117
00:04:21,467 --> 00:04:24,736
The toxicology report
was positive for cytrophynal

118
00:04:24,737 --> 00:04:26,103
as well as alcohol.

119
00:04:26,604 --> 00:04:27,605
That's a lie.

120
00:04:27,606 --> 00:04:29,474
I know, we'll address it. And
did you test for blood alcohol?

121
00:04:29,475 --> 00:04:31,208
Yes, it was .06.

122
00:04:31,209 --> 00:04:32,844
Thank you, Ms. Patel.

123
00:04:32,845 --> 00:04:34,178
Excuse me,
Mr. Coroner,

124
00:04:34,679 --> 00:04:36,414
may I ask a question?

125
00:04:36,415 --> 00:04:38,214
You... who are you?

126
00:04:38,215 --> 00:04:39,883
Alicia Florrick,
Mr. Coroner.

127
00:04:39,884 --> 00:04:41,251
I represent the wife
of the deceased.

128
00:04:41,252 --> 00:04:44,187
Ah, yes, the wife of the
state's attorney

129
00:04:44,188 --> 00:04:46,389
in the one county
that's seen fit to do away

130
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:49,092
with the office of
the coroner altogether.

131
00:04:49,093 --> 00:04:50,760
Please, probe away.

132
00:04:50,761 --> 00:04:51,628
Thank you.

133
00:04:52,129 --> 00:04:55,765
Ms. Patel, .06 BAC is below

134
00:04:55,766 --> 00:04:57,467
- the legal intoxication limit, isn't it?
- It is.

135
00:04:57,468 --> 00:05:00,970
.06 would be consistent
with the judge, having say,

136
00:05:00,971 --> 00:05:02,939
two glasses of wine,
with dinner,

137
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:05,240
an hour before
the accident?

138
00:05:05,241 --> 00:05:07,376
Based on his weight
of 192 pounds,

139
00:05:07,377 --> 00:05:08,877
I suppose that's about right.

140
00:05:08,878 --> 00:05:11,379
And the cytrophynal,
a medication

141
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:12,881
used to treat insomnia.

142
00:05:12,882 --> 00:05:15,216
Could there not be
residual traces of it

143
00:05:15,217 --> 00:05:16,217
from the night before?

144
00:05:16,218 --> 00:05:17,719
Yes, uh, cytrophynal can

145
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,288
linger in the system
for several days.

146
00:05:20,289 --> 00:05:21,823
So, therefore, could Justice...

147
00:05:21,824 --> 00:05:22,791
I'm sorry, ma'am,

148
00:05:22,792 --> 00:05:24,525
you've asked your
three questions.

149
00:05:26,026 --> 00:05:26,826
I...

150
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,295
I'm sorry?

151
00:05:28,296 --> 00:05:29,930
You've asked
your three questions.

152
00:05:29,931 --> 00:05:31,732
Attorneys in an inquest
are permitted

153
00:05:31,733 --> 00:05:34,401
to ask questions,
but only a total of three.

154
00:05:34,902 --> 00:05:35,902
Really?

155
00:05:35,903 --> 00:05:37,104
Sorry.

156
00:05:37,605 --> 00:05:38,338
What if I'm fast?

157
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:39,339
(Chuckling)

158
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:41,173
No, I'm sorry.

159
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,142
I'll have to ask you
to take your seat.

160
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:45,044

Uh, Mr. Claypool,

00:05:50,518 --> 00:05:52,318
I have just one
question, if that's okay.

165
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:53,452
Yes, certainly.
Please.

166
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:55,087
Ms. Patel,
in your opinion,

167
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:57,389
can the amount of alcohol
that results

168
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,357
in a .06 BAC still be enough

169
00:05:59,358 --> 00:06:00,926
to impair
someone's judgment...

170
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:02,794
Objection,
goes beyond the scope.

171
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:04,062
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
Mrs. Florrick,

172
00:06:04,063 --> 00:06:07,032
as I said before,
this is not a regular trial.

173
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,200
There are no objections here.

174
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:14,371
Will Gardner, please.

175
00:06:15,872 --> 00:06:17,207
Are you sure?

176
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:18,375
No.

177
00:06:18,376 --> 00:06:20,711
Well, I'm just as
unfamiliar as Alic...

178
00:06:20,712 --> 00:06:21,679
Okay, I'll see you then.

179
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,747
What was that?

180
00:06:23,448 --> 00:06:24,549
Janie Ludwig.

181
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,150
- Her husband's inquest.
- Oh, yes,

182
00:06:26,651 --> 00:06:27,151
that car crash.

183
00:06:27,152 --> 00:06:28,252
It was horrible.

184
00:06:28,253 --> 00:06:29,853
- How is she?
- Upset.

185
00:06:29,854 --> 00:06:31,688
She wants me to help
Alicia at the inquest.

186
00:06:31,689 --> 00:06:33,189
Well, that sounds right.
What's the problem?

187
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:35,324
Nothing. What's up?

188
00:06:35,325 --> 00:06:37,761
An invitation to the
Chicago Shamrock Dinner.

189
00:06:37,762 --> 00:06:39,394
We've been
asked to buy a table.

190
00:06:39,395 --> 00:06:40,663
They've never
invited us before.

191
00:06:40,664 --> 00:06:41,931
I know,
we're moving up in the world.

192
00:06:41,932 --> 00:06:43,632
And with
Alicia's husband there,

193
00:06:43,633 --> 00:06:45,300
it might be a slap
in the face if we say no.

194
00:06:45,301 --> 00:06:46,769
Peter didn't win yet, did he?

195
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:49,137
The last I heard, it was neck
and neck between him and Maddie.

196
00:06:49,138 --> 00:06:51,974
I'll wait to see if he wins
before buying a table.

197
00:06:52,475 --> 00:06:53,241
DIANE:
Cary.

198
00:06:53,242 --> 00:06:55,043
Yes, you needed me?

199
00:06:55,044 --> 00:06:57,111
Congratulations.
What fantastic news.

200
00:06:57,112 --> 00:06:59,013
WILL: Talk about landing
the big fish, good job.

201
00:06:59,414 --> 00:07:00,414
I...

202
00:07:00,415 --> 00:07:02,884
We weren't even trying
for Emmonds Pharmaceuticals.

203
00:07:02,885 --> 00:07:04,552
We thought they were
deep into Canning's pocket.

204
00:07:04,553 --> 00:07:05,720
How'd you do it?

205
00:07:08,824 --> 00:07:10,891
- Well, I'm just one part of a team.
- That's not what I heard.

206
00:07:10,892 --> 00:07:13,293
Their chief counsel said it was
all because of you.

207
00:07:13,294 --> 00:07:14,494
DIANE:
This is a good way

208
00:07:14,495 --> 00:07:16,162
to stay on the equity
partner track, Cary.

209
00:07:16,163 --> 00:07:18,364
$5 million a year
in litigation costs?

210
00:07:18,865 --> 00:07:19,399
Pretty impressive.

211
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,101
That's their spokesman now.

212
00:07:21,102 --> 00:07:22,102
He's in your office, Cary.

213
00:07:22,103 --> 00:07:24,137
- He wants to say hello.
- Okay.

214
00:07:24,338 --> 00:07:25,371
Emmonds Pharmaceuticals.

215
00:07:25,572 --> 00:07:28,207
Yes, good job.
(Laughing)

216
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,074
The best IPTV in the UK
WWW.ALLIN1BOX.CO.UK

217
00:07:37,234 --> 00:07:39,835
Hello.

218
00:07:39,836 --> 00:07:41,003
Dad?

219
00:07:41,004 --> 00:07:42,204
Cary.

220
00:07:42,705 --> 00:07:44,472
Sir, hi.

221
00:07:45,473 --> 00:07:46,474
This is a surprise.

222
00:07:46,475 --> 00:07:48,009
I hope so.

223
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,478
And this is a very cool office.

224
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:53,348
You have a view, two desks,

225
00:07:53,349 --> 00:07:55,183
you're on the same floor
as the partners.

226
00:07:55,184 --> 00:07:56,717
I'm impressed.

227
00:07:56,718 --> 00:07:58,353
Yeah, thanks, Dad.
So, what's going on?

228
00:07:58,354 --> 00:07:59,719
Well, I'm back in Chicago.

229
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,687
Yeah.

230
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:02,222
Sorry about that
press secretary job.

231
00:08:02,223 --> 00:08:03,823
No, no, no, look.

232
00:08:03,824 --> 00:08:04,958
That was inappropriate of me

233
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:06,360
to even ask for that favor.

234
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:08,762
And I realized that the job
wasn't quite

235
00:08:08,763 --> 00:08:10,230
the right fit
for me anyway.

236
00:08:10,231 --> 00:08:12,132
- That's good.
- I'm lobbying.

237
00:08:12,133 --> 00:08:13,433
For Emmonds
Pharmaceuticals now.

238
00:08:13,434 --> 00:08:15,902
And we were looking for
a firm to help us draft

239
00:08:15,903 --> 00:08:17,536
a medical
marijuana statute

240
00:08:17,537 --> 00:08:20,873
to take to the general
assembly, and I...

241
00:08:21,874 --> 00:08:23,342
thought of you.

242
00:08:23,343 --> 00:08:25,044
You thought of me?

243
00:08:25,045 --> 00:08:26,512
Ha, don't
sound so surprised.

244
00:08:26,513 --> 00:08:27,914
Of course I
thought of you.

245
00:08:27,915 --> 00:08:28,915
You're good.

246
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:30,449
Your firm is hot right now.

247
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:32,617
A pharmaceutical
company wants to get

248
00:08:32,618 --> 00:08:35,520
a medical
marijuana law passed?

249
00:08:35,521 --> 00:08:37,522
Well, right now,
there is a competing

250
00:08:37,523 --> 00:08:39,224
initiative being written.

251
00:08:39,475 --> 00:08:41,909
We want ours to take
a different approach.

252
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:43,378
There's a
medical marijuana initiative

253
00:08:43,379 --> 00:08:46,147
being written
and Emmonds is concerned

254
00:08:46,148 --> 00:08:47,814
if it succeeds,
it'll cut into their profits,

255
00:08:47,815 --> 00:08:50,217
so they want to draft
a competing initiative

256
00:08:50,218 --> 00:08:51,518
to confuse the voters?

257
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,453
(Chuckling): Come on,
let's not put it like that.

258
00:08:53,454 --> 00:08:56,022
We-we want a more
sensible initiative.

259
00:08:56,023 --> 00:08:57,157
How's that sound?

260
00:08:57,158 --> 00:08:58,325
Sensible.

261
00:08:58,326 --> 00:09:00,294
Good.

262
00:09:00,295 --> 00:09:02,596
I thought that you
could draft the initiative

263
00:09:02,597 --> 00:09:05,898
and then represent us through
the legislative process.

264
00:09:07,467 --> 00:09:08,501
What?

265
00:09:08,502 --> 00:09:10,969
I just...

266
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:12,638
I didn't think you
were going to talk to me again.

267
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:13,875
(Sighs):

268
00:09:13,939 --> 00:09:15,175
Cary.

269
00:09:16,176 --> 00:09:17,976
You're my only son.

270
00:09:17,977 --> 00:09:20,044
I'm never not
going to talk to you.

271
00:09:21,347 --> 00:09:23,848
NEWSWOMAN: <i>We are now confident</i>
<i>reporting the projected</i>

272
00:09:23,849 --> 00:09:26,384
Democratic primary winner
for Illinois governor

273
00:09:26,385 --> 00:09:28,286
is going to be State's Attorney
Peter Florrick.

274
00:09:28,287 --> 00:09:31,256
(Cheering loudly)
Congratulations, sir.

275
00:09:31,257 --> 00:09:34,125
I said-said
congratulations, sir.

276
00:09:34,126 --> 00:09:36,860
Now we turn to Kresteva.

277
00:09:36,861 --> 00:09:40,598
I said now we turn
to Kresteva!

278
00:09:41,599 --> 00:09:43,434
Sir, I wanted to talk
to you about Jordan.

279
00:09:43,435 --> 00:09:45,736
I don't
think we need him.

280
00:09:46,737 --> 00:09:47,705
Are you sure?

281
00:09:47,706 --> 00:09:49,907
Because I think we're losing
our singularity of purpose.

282
00:09:50,575 --> 00:09:52,642
WOMAN: Whoo!
- Yeah.

283
00:09:52,643 --> 00:09:53,809
No, I understand.

284
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:55,578
Okay, okay.

285
00:09:55,579 --> 00:09:56,912
Good job, Eli.

286
00:09:56,913 --> 00:09:58,981
Well done.

287
00:09:58,982 --> 00:10:01,016
Oh, come on, let's hug.

288
00:10:02,319 --> 00:10:03,720
Now comes the real battle.

289
00:10:03,721 --> 00:10:05,321
Now it comes.

290
00:10:05,322 --> 00:10:08,690
On that note, I need
to show you something.

291
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,492
Zach Florrick
has a girlfriend.

292
00:10:10,493 --> 00:10:12,093
Her name is Nisa Dalmar.

293
00:10:12,094 --> 00:10:13,528
I know, she's black.

294
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:14,696
It's all fine.

295
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:16,898
No, that's not it.

296
00:10:16,899 --> 00:10:19,167
Did you see this photo
that she tweeted today?

297
00:10:19,168 --> 00:10:20,769
It's a
Milad-un-Nabi festival.

298
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:22,604
It's a celebration
of the Prophet's birth.

299
00:10:22,605 --> 00:10:24,938
I did a deeper
check into Nisa's father.

300
00:10:24,939 --> 00:10:27,642
He donated to the
Hamas charity organization,

301
00:10:27,643 --> 00:10:28,743
Mouharib Mousalim.

302
00:10:28,744 --> 00:10:31,679
- When?
- His last donation was in 2008.

303
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,349
And Mouharib Mousalim was just
put on the treasury's list

304
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:38,386
for terrorist affiliations
this past October.

305
00:10:41,823 --> 00:10:43,123
What?

306
00:10:43,624 --> 00:10:45,759
We should do
something about it.

307
00:10:47,262 --> 00:10:49,329
As you can see,
the skid marks on the road

308
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:50,463
- reveal a course correction.
- HmHmm

309
00:10:50,464 --> 00:10:52,732
Uh, using the formula for
minimum skid speed

310
00:10:52,733 --> 00:10:54,968
we determined he
was driving roughly

311
00:10:54,969 --> 00:10:56,335
55 miles per hour,

312
00:10:56,336 --> 00:10:57,904
which is ten miles
over the speed limit.

313
00:10:57,905 --> 00:11:00,673
Speeding
equals reckless driving.

314
00:11:00,674 --> 00:11:02,909
Uh, Mr. Gardner.

315
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:05,878
Time for the main event.
WILL (Quietly): I'm not here to replace you.

316
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:08,647
- Mrs. Ludwig just asked me to
assist, that's all.    - It's okay.

317
00:11:08,648 --> 00:11:10,016
We, uh, recovered Justice
Ludwig's cell phone,

318
00:11:10,017 --> 00:11:12,684
which he was using
at the time of the crash.

319
00:11:12,685 --> 00:11:15,586
Um, that may also have
contributed to the accident.

320
00:11:15,587 --> 00:11:18,356
- Anything from the gallery?
WILL: Yes, sir, if I may.

321
00:11:18,357 --> 00:11:20,859
- And you are?
- Will Gardner. I'm also on Mrs. Ludwig's

322
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,660
- legal team.
(Quietly): You only get three questions.

323
00:11:22,661 --> 00:11:24,329
You can only ask
three questions.

324
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:25,730
CLAYPOOL: She has
a legal team now.

325
00:11:25,731 --> 00:11:27,732
(Chuckles)
This is getting serious.

326
00:11:28,433 --> 00:11:31,302
- Proceed.
- I, uh...

327
00:11:31,993 --> 00:11:33,437
Although there was
no Bluetooth

328
00:11:33,438 --> 00:11:37,708
in Justice Ludwig's car,
his phone had a speaker function

329
00:11:37,709 --> 00:11:40,244
making it possible for him to...

330
00:11:40,245 --> 00:11:43,380
make a call and not hold
his cell phone while driving...

331
00:11:44,381 --> 00:11:45,748
- isn't that right?
- Yes,

332
00:11:45,749 --> 00:11:48,117
but we have no way of knowing
if he was actually holding it

333
00:11:48,118 --> 00:11:50,453
- or not.
- Okay, but rather than...

334
00:11:50,954 --> 00:11:54,657
the use of a phone
or the speed he was traveling,

335
00:11:54,658 --> 00:11:58,027
couldn't the presence
of black ice on the road

336
00:11:58,028 --> 00:11:59,462
have forced Justice Ludwig

337
00:11:59,463 --> 00:12:03,031
to make the course correction,
sending him into the guardrail,

338
00:12:03,032 --> 00:12:04,566
which by its mere presence

339
00:12:04,567 --> 00:12:07,836
implies this is a very sharp
curve in the road?

340
00:12:07,837 --> 00:12:12,040
- Objection. Mr. Gardner is combining
several questions...   - As I've said,

341
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:14,076
Mr. Hobson, there are
no objections here.

342
00:12:14,077 --> 00:12:16,143
- Officer?
- Taking the points one at a time,

343
00:12:17,144 --> 00:12:19,914
uh, guardrails are placed by
the Department of Transportation

344
00:12:19,915 --> 00:12:21,548
for various reasons, sir.

345
00:12:21,549 --> 00:12:24,485
And, yes, I observed black ice
on the road that night,

346
00:12:24,486 --> 00:12:26,387
but with those
road conditions,

347
00:12:26,388 --> 00:12:29,490
- the victim should have been driving
under the speed limit.   - Excuse me.

348
00:12:29,491 --> 00:12:32,759
Mr. Coroner, I would like
to reserve our third question.

349
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,561
Objec... Uh, point of...
clarification.

350
00:12:35,562 --> 00:12:37,430
Uh, can he do that?

351
00:12:38,131 --> 00:12:40,433
I don't see why not.

352
00:12:40,434 --> 00:12:44,037
Now, Officer, let's talk
some more about this black ice.

353
00:12:44,038 --> 00:12:45,838
(Camera shutter clicking)

354
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,807
(Phone ringing, vibrating)

355
00:12:52,913 --> 00:12:54,880
Hello?

356
00:12:54,881 --> 00:12:56,848
Oh, yeah, this is Robyn,
Mrs. Florrick,

357
00:12:56,849 --> 00:12:58,517
the other investigator
you hired.

358
00:12:58,518 --> 00:13:00,852
- Oh, hi. How are you?
- Good, good.

359
00:13:00,853 --> 00:13:03,422
Cold. Uh, I saw Kalinda's phone
ringing and I picked it up.

360
00:13:03,423 --> 00:13:05,489
- Do you want me to ask
her something?     - Yes.

361
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:07,758
Ask her, is there anything
that can point to an accident

362
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:08,927
and not recklessness?

363
00:13:08,928 --> 00:13:10,361
We're questioning
the officer right now.

364
00:13:10,362 --> 00:13:11,562
Hold on, Mrs. Florrick.

365
00:13:11,563 --> 00:13:13,731
Thanks.

366
00:13:13,732 --> 00:13:16,935
Hi, uh...

367
00:13:18,269 --> 00:13:20,370
Look, can I call you back?

368
00:13:21,605 --> 00:13:23,373
Yeah, I know.
I saw that.

369
00:13:23,874 --> 00:13:25,575
It's weird, huh?

370
00:13:26,576 --> 00:13:30,146
OFFICER: ...which is why we concluded that, uh,
black ice was not a likely cause.

371
00:13:30,147 --> 00:13:31,048
CLAYPOOL:
Very well.

372
00:13:31,049 --> 00:13:32,282
Thank you, Officer.

373
00:13:32,283 --> 00:13:33,883
- Mr. Claypool, may I ask a question?
- Mr. Gardner

374
00:13:33,884 --> 00:13:35,518
has already asked
all the questions

375
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,386
for Mrs. Ludwig's legal team,
Mr. Coroner.

376
00:13:37,387 --> 00:13:39,155
No, not all. We have one left.

377
00:13:39,156 --> 00:13:40,056
That is correct.

378
00:13:40,057 --> 00:13:41,958
Ask your question,
Mrs. Florrick.

379
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,961
Officer Rivera...

380
00:13:44,962 --> 00:13:46,895
has the county been replacing

381
00:13:46,896 --> 00:13:50,299
the dimmer, orange incandescent
streetlights on that road

382
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,233
with the brighter L.E.D. lights,

383
00:13:52,234 --> 00:13:54,702
which would mean
that the night of the accident,

384
00:13:54,703 --> 00:13:56,904
in the hundred yards
preceding the bend

385
00:13:56,905 --> 00:13:58,506
in the road, the judge

386
00:13:58,507 --> 00:14:00,741
entered a darker stretch
that doesn't show

387
00:14:00,742 --> 00:14:02,210
the black ice as well,

388
00:14:02,211 --> 00:14:04,045
resulting in
the judge having

389
00:14:04,046 --> 00:14:06,881
to make a last-second
course correction?

390
00:14:11,786 --> 00:14:12,719
Yes.

391
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,254
Thank you.

392
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:17,391
Looks like an
accident to me.

393
00:14:17,392 --> 00:14:19,326
Mr. Hobson, any questions?

394
00:14:19,827 --> 00:14:23,330
Officer Rivera, upon looking
into the cell phone records,

395
00:14:23,331 --> 00:14:26,399
did you determine the call
the judge was making

396
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,867
at the time of the accident?

397
00:14:27,868 --> 00:14:29,302
Yes, he'd called his voice mail.

398
00:14:29,303 --> 00:14:31,937
And from whom did he receive
voice mail messages that night?

399
00:14:31,938 --> 00:14:33,306
There was only one.

400
00:14:33,307 --> 00:14:35,708
It was from the Illinois
Attorney General's office.

401
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:37,176
Uh, their anti-corruption unit.

402
00:14:37,177 --> 00:14:39,045
Last question then.
To your knowledge,

403
00:14:39,046 --> 00:14:42,747
what does this anti-corruption
unit investigates?

404
00:14:42,748 --> 00:14:43,848
Uh, public officials

405
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:46,818
for, uh, corruption
and ethics violations.

406
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:48,553
Mr. Coroner, I'm aware
that only you can

407
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:51,789
introduce evidence, but it is
our belief that the deceased

408
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:55,327
- ran his car off the road in an attempt
to commit suicide. WILL: Oh, come on.

409
00:14:55,328 --> 00:14:56,693
He can't just
spin a story

410
00:14:56,694 --> 00:14:58,629
- in front of the jury.
- Mr. Gardner,

411
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:00,998
please. What evidence?

412
00:15:00,999 --> 00:15:02,966
Evidence regarding
the judge's last weeks,

413
00:15:02,967 --> 00:15:06,637
when he discovered that he was
being investigated for bribery.

414
00:15:06,638 --> 00:15:08,506
This is outrageous,
Mr. Coroner.

415
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:11,208
Mr. Hobson is trying to void
a life insurance policy--

416
00:15:11,209 --> 00:15:14,244
- that's the only reason he's
arguing for suicide.-  Not at all.

417
00:15:14,245 --> 00:15:16,079
Like Mrs. Ludwig's
abundant legal team,

418
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,148
- I'm just trying to get to the truth here.
CLAYPOOL: Okay.

419
00:15:18,149 --> 00:15:21,918
Whether it is or is not
outrageous, I will decide.

420
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:23,186
Please have your evidence

421
00:15:23,187 --> 00:15:27,190
ready tomorrow,
and I will review.

422

What'd I do?

425
00:15:45,955 --> 00:15:48,824
Nothing.
We thought we would just talk.</i>

426
00:15:48,825 --> 00:15:51,159
You've been doing great work
with I.T., Zach.

427
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,627
We are really
thrilled.

428
00:15:52,628 --> 00:15:54,662
Okay.

429
00:15:55,396 --> 00:15:57,431
So, you and your girlfriend,

430
00:15:57,432 --> 00:15:58,966
y-you're pretty serious, right?

431
00:15:58,967 --> 00:16:00,634
Yeah.

432
00:16:00,635 --> 00:16:01,769
This is about Nisa?

433
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:02,903
JORDAN:
No. Well...

434
00:16:02,904 --> 00:16:04,438
a little.

435
00:16:04,439 --> 00:16:06,640
I remember my first
girlfriend in high school.

436
00:16:06,641 --> 00:16:08,042
She meant everything to me.

437
00:16:08,043 --> 00:16:09,243
Nisa's not my first girlfriend.

438
00:16:09,244 --> 00:16:10,977
Oh. Well...

439
00:16:10,978 --> 00:16:12,311
that's good to know.

440
00:16:12,312 --> 00:16:15,348
Do you mind if, uh,
I show you a tweet

441
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:16,716
that your girlfriend sent out?
(Phone vibrates)

442
00:16:16,717 --> 00:16:19,585
- Uh, wh-what tweet?
- Yeah.

443
00:16:19,586 --> 00:16:20,585
(Groans)

444
00:16:20,586 --> 00:16:21,387
Okay.

445
00:16:21,388 --> 00:16:23,389
What, right now?
Okay, okay.

446
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:25,691
They need me to change
something in the stump.

447
00:16:25,692 --> 00:16:27,860
I'll be right back.

448
00:16:30,329 --> 00:16:32,197
I can't believe you're
trying to break them up.

449
00:16:32,698 --> 00:16:35,667
- Do you see me doing anything?
- Hmm?

450
00:16:36,668 --> 00:16:37,669
JORDAN:
<i>See, the thing is,</i>

451
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:40,739
Zach, that... you
have to start thinking

452
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:44,175
about all your relationships
in relation to the campaign.

453
00:16:44,176 --> 00:16:47,745
'Cause there is already a
spotlight on your mom and dad.

454
00:16:48,746 --> 00:16:49,814
(Quietly):
See if they're done.

455
00:16:49,815 --> 00:16:51,515
(Quietly):
I'm not seeing if they're done.

456
00:16:51,516 --> 00:16:54,018
Nora, I am the boss.
You are the...

457
00:16:54,019 --> 00:16:55,619
Oh, Zach,

458
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,488
is everything all right?
What's wrong?

459
00:16:57,489 --> 00:16:59,455
It's nothing. I'm fine.

460
00:16:59,456 --> 00:17:02,625
What is it? What'd he say?

461
00:17:03,427 --> 00:17:05,162
Mrs. Florrick.

462
00:17:05,163 --> 00:17:08,265
- Mr. Agos, I heard we were
representing you now.   - Yes,

463
00:17:08,266 --> 00:17:11,668
well, I figured, anything I
could do to help Cary, why not?

464
00:17:11,669 --> 00:17:14,271
You know, I saw your name
listed with the partners.

465
00:17:14,272 --> 00:17:16,138
- Aren't you the same year as Cary?
- Well,

466
00:17:16,139 --> 00:17:17,773
we came in together,
but then Cary left

467
00:17:17,774 --> 00:17:20,109
and came back again, and we're
thrilled to have him.

468
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:21,811
So he's not on the partner track?

469
00:17:21,812 --> 00:17:23,645
No, no. I'm, um... Yes.

470
00:17:23,646 --> 00:17:25,915
- He definitely will be. Soon.
- Dad.

471
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:28,017
Hi, son. I got sidetracked
with Alicia.

472
00:17:28,018 --> 00:17:30,985
You know, it's fantastic
how quickly she made partner.

473
00:17:30,986 --> 00:17:33,387
And if that doesn't
light a fire under you,

474
00:17:33,388 --> 00:17:34,655
I don't know what will.

475
00:17:34,656 --> 00:17:36,291
(Woman sighs)

476
00:17:36,292 --> 00:17:38,159
Christie Yeargin.
I've been an investigator

477
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,862
at the Illinois Attorney
General's office for six years.

478
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:42,663
Apologies for the
temperature in here, ma'am.

479
00:17:42,664 --> 00:17:45,599
I've asked for some space
heaters in here. (Chuckles)

480
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,634
Now, you were in charge

481
00:17:47,635 --> 00:17:51,638
- of the investigation into
Justice Roger Ludwig? - Yes.

482
00:17:51,639 --> 00:17:53,373
Ms. Yeargin,
what was the basis

483
00:17:53,374 --> 00:17:55,508
for the investigation
into Justice Ludwig?

484
00:17:55,509 --> 00:17:57,311
We had him pegged
as a bribery target.

485
00:17:57,312 --> 00:17:58,511
I see. Did this
have anything to do

486
00:17:58,512 --> 00:17:59,479
with his participation

487
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,048
in a Wednesday night
basketball game

488
00:18:01,049 --> 00:18:04,250
with Mr. Gardner over here?
Yes and no.

489
00:18:04,251 --> 00:18:05,985
We started looking into the
deceased

490
00:18:05,986 --> 00:18:08,454
because of the basketball
games, but...

491
00:18:08,455 --> 00:18:10,122
we continued our investigation

492
00:18:10,123 --> 00:18:13,059
because of Justice Ludwig's
financial troubles.

493
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:15,761
He and his wife were a little
overextended on their mortgage.

494
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:18,497
You have only one more question,
Mr. Hobson.

495
00:18:18,498 --> 00:18:20,398
Yes. Thank you.

496
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:22,868
Ms. Yeargin,
during your investigation

497
00:18:22,869 --> 00:18:25,170
of Justice Ludwig, would you say

498
00:18:25,171 --> 00:18:27,605
that the combination
of this attention,

499
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:30,075
along with his obviously
precarious finances,

500
00:18:30,076 --> 00:18:33,444
was making him depressed--
depressed enough, in fact,

501
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,679
to do something desperate,
something like suicide?

502
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,547
YEARGIN: Well, he wasn't
happy about it.

503
00:18:37,548 --> 00:18:39,216
But beyond that, I couldn't say.

504
00:18:39,217 --> 00:18:42,219
(Sighs)
Nice speech, Mr. Hobson.

505
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:44,821
Way to hit the suicide theme.

506
00:18:44,822 --> 00:18:46,290
Ms. Yeargin,
how many judges

507
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,792
does the Attorney General's
office investigate every year?

508
00:18:48,793 --> 00:18:50,327
Depends on the year.

509
00:18:50,328 --> 00:18:53,629
Oh, we're always looking for
potential corruption targets.

510
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:55,531
And how many of these
investigations actually bear...

511
00:18:55,532 --> 00:18:59,769
Strike that. How many times
does your investigation

512
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:02,772
actually lead to charges
being filed against the judge?

513
00:19:02,773 --> 00:19:04,640
- Thankfully, not very often.
- And in this case,

514
00:19:04,641 --> 00:19:07,175
you didn't have
any solid evidence

515
00:19:07,176 --> 00:19:10,012
that Justice Ludwig had actually
accepted a bribe, did you?

516
00:19:10,013 --> 00:19:11,813
Not yet,
but we were working on it.

517
00:19:11,814 --> 00:19:13,882
- And did you feel that...
- Ah.

518
00:19:13,883 --> 00:19:15,918
Thank you. Nothing further.

519
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:19,487
Uh... you're sure you don't
want to wait for Kalinda?

520
00:19:19,488 --> 00:19:21,990
No, we have
to get back to...

521
00:19:21,991 --> 00:19:23,925
- the morgue.
- It's okay, Robyn.

522
00:19:23,926 --> 00:19:26,493
We just need a rundown
on the facts.

523
00:19:26,494 --> 00:19:29,163
Okay, um...

524
00:19:29,164 --> 00:19:32,266
well, the Ludwigs, they-they did
have financial problems.

525
00:19:32,267 --> 00:19:35,102
And as far as we can tell,
Mr. Ludwig-- Justice Ludwig--

526
00:19:35,103 --> 00:19:37,438
kept them from his wife--
the money troubles.

527
00:19:37,439 --> 00:19:40,673
And the bribery investigation
is based on a lawyer

528
00:19:40,674 --> 00:19:42,008
who was accused
of bribing judges.

529
00:19:42,009 --> 00:19:43,276
It's okay. We don't need
to go into that.

530
00:19:43,277 --> 00:19:45,578
Okay. Um,

531
00:19:45,579 --> 00:19:47,747
the justice's last day:
He had dinner that night

532
00:19:47,748 --> 00:19:50,450
at 8:00 p.m. with a friend.
Jared Bigelow, a lobbyist.

533
00:19:50,451 --> 00:19:52,618
And... Oh, we were able
to download the judge's I-PASS.

534
00:19:52,619 --> 00:19:53,853
Do you know what that is?

535
00:19:53,854 --> 00:19:55,687
- From the Tri-State Tollway?
- Yes, we do.

536
00:19:55,688 --> 00:19:56,989
Well, the last record
we could find

537
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:59,491
is that he exited the tollway
at 10:37 p.m.,

538
00:19:59,492 --> 00:20:02,328
but what's strange
is the accident was at 11:42.

539
00:20:02,329 --> 00:20:03,628
And why is that strange?

540
00:20:03,629 --> 00:20:06,598
It took him an hour
to travel four miles.

541
00:20:08,568 --> 00:20:10,235
You checked where
he might've stopped?

542
00:20:10,236 --> 00:20:11,902
There are only two options
at that exit:

543
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:14,572
A gas station and a motel.

544
00:20:15,807 --> 00:20:20,111
Let's not update Mrs. Ludwig
on this until we know for sure.

545
00:20:20,112 --> 00:20:22,146
But keep up the good work.

546
00:20:23,414 --> 00:20:24,715
JEFFREY:
<i>The application fee</i>

547
00:20:24,716 --> 00:20:27,184
for a marijuana
dispensary

548
00:20:27,185 --> 00:20:30,153
increases from $2,000 to $5,000.
That's good. The license fee

549
00:20:30,154 --> 00:20:32,222
ought to increase as well
though, don't you think?

550
00:20:32,223 --> 00:20:33,656
I didn't want to get greedy.

551
00:20:33,657 --> 00:20:35,025
It's good for the state budget.

552
00:20:35,026 --> 00:20:37,361
Well... (Sighs)
I think...

553
00:20:37,362 --> 00:20:39,329
it might start to seem obvious

554
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:41,564
that the initiative
isn't exactly genuine.

555
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,000
Dispensary

556
00:20:44,001 --> 00:20:46,469
locations to be
at least 300 yards away

557
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:49,038
from the nearest school.
We should change that to 500.

558
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,740
We're the third-largest
school district in the country.

559
00:20:51,741 --> 00:20:53,542
- If you make it 500...
- It makes it

560
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:55,644
more difficult to find
a location for a shop.

561
00:20:55,645 --> 00:20:57,179
It makes it transparent
that the law

562
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,447
isn't about medical marijuana.

563
00:20:58,448 --> 00:21:00,348
It's about protecting
your market.

564
00:21:01,183 --> 00:21:03,584
Do we have some problem here?

565
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:06,721
I don't think so.

566
00:21:06,722 --> 00:21:10,858
Maybe we should ask a partner
to sit in, help supervise.

567
00:21:12,761 --> 00:21:14,129
Sure.

568
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:15,734
If that's what you want.

569
00:21:18,554 --> 00:21:20,221
KALINDA:
Hi.

570
00:21:20,222 --> 00:21:22,089
Would you two like a room?

571
00:21:22,924 --> 00:21:24,892
Uh, no.

572
00:21:24,893 --> 00:21:27,895
I just would like to ask
you some questions.

573
00:21:27,896 --> 00:21:30,665
Am I in some
kind of trouble?

574
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:32,466
I don't think so.

575
00:21:32,467 --> 00:21:36,035
Were you working here
on the night of March 2?

576
00:21:36,036 --> 00:21:40,707
Um, I work every night except
Tuesday and Sunday, s-so...

577
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:42,041
So, that's a yes.

578
00:21:42,042 --> 00:21:43,743
Do you remember

579
00:21:43,744 --> 00:21:45,812
if you saw this man that night?

580
00:21:45,813 --> 00:21:49,115
I'm not supposed to give
information out about our guests

581
00:21:49,116 --> 00:21:51,217
unless it's to the police.

582
00:21:51,218 --> 00:21:53,018
Are you the police?

583
00:21:53,819 --> 00:21:55,621
No.

584
00:22:00,293 --> 00:22:01,793
Sure.

585
00:22:01,794 --> 00:22:04,006
He was here.
He had a room, paid cash.

586
00:22:04,007 --> 00:22:06,131
- Was he with anyone?
- He checked in alone, but...

587
00:22:06,132 --> 00:22:08,099
when he left,
he was with a woman.

588
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,400
A blonde woman.

589
00:22:09,401 --> 00:22:10,868
They were arguing.

590
00:22:10,869 --> 00:22:12,270
Did you hear what
they were yelling?

591
00:22:12,271 --> 00:22:15,640
No. He got into his car,
she got into her SUV.

592
00:22:15,641 --> 00:22:17,875
- They both left.
- Do you remember anything

593
00:22:17,876 --> 00:22:19,677
- about the SUV?
- It was nighttime.

594
00:22:19,678 --> 00:22:23,947
All I could see was that it was
a dark four-door, I think...

595
00:22:23,948 --> 00:22:26,783
Oh, it had... it had
one of those license plates.

596
00:22:26,784 --> 00:22:29,319
- Which license plate?
- The specialty ones.

597
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:33,022
I-I didn't see the number,
but it had a bird on it.

598
00:22:33,023 --> 00:22:34,658
Okay.

599
00:22:34,659 --> 00:22:36,059
Thanks.

600
00:22:41,497 --> 00:22:43,666
It's hard to work with
a relative, isn't it?

601
00:22:43,667 --> 00:22:45,301
Not really.

602
00:22:45,302 --> 00:22:46,402
Why?

603
00:22:46,403 --> 00:22:48,971
Your dad. It must
be difficult.

604
00:22:48,972 --> 00:22:51,907
When personal feelings
enter into legal work,

605
00:22:51,908 --> 00:22:54,342
it makes everything
a big emotional stew.

606
00:22:55,043 --> 00:22:58,280
- Did I do something?
- No, no.

607
00:22:58,781 --> 00:23:00,882
I just think, um...

608
00:23:00,883 --> 00:23:04,085
we want to give the Emmonds
team everything they want.

609
00:23:04,486 --> 00:23:05,754
Defer to them.

610
00:23:06,755 --> 00:23:08,690
It's a good client
to keep happy.

611
00:23:08,691 --> 00:23:10,057
Did my dad talk to you?

612
00:23:10,058 --> 00:23:11,292
That's not important, Cary.

613
00:23:11,293 --> 00:23:14,528
I should keep closer
tabs on this, anyway.

614
00:23:14,529 --> 00:23:16,530
- What did he say?
- Nothing.

615
00:23:16,531 --> 00:23:17,931
Cary...

616
00:23:17,932 --> 00:23:19,500
everything's fine.

617
00:23:19,501 --> 00:23:22,436
I'd just like to sit in
on the next meeting.

618
00:23:22,437 --> 00:23:25,406
- If you don't mind.
- No. I don't.

619
00:23:25,407 --> 00:23:26,839
That would be good.

620
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,074
Great. Keep up
the good work.

621
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:35,715
- Last Saturday night?
- Yeah. Gas station on Route 2,

622
00:23:35,716 --> 00:23:37,583
down the road
from the motel.

623
00:23:37,584 --> 00:23:39,952
The attendant said he
couldn't see the road

624
00:23:39,953 --> 00:23:42,188
because your tanker
was blocking his view.

625
00:23:42,189 --> 00:23:44,323
So who are you two,
Cagney and Lacey?

626
00:23:44,324 --> 00:23:46,425
Uh, there was a crash
a few minutes later.

627
00:23:46,426 --> 00:23:48,660
We're just trying to find out
if anyone saw anything.

628
00:23:48,661 --> 00:23:51,296
Sure, I saw something.
What do I get for telling you?

629
00:23:51,297 --> 00:23:53,898
A clear conscience
that you did the right thing.

630
00:23:53,899 --> 00:23:55,767
(Chuckles):
Yeah. What else?

631
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:23,292
- I didn't see the crash, but
I saw the cars.  -  Uh, cars?

632
00:24:23,293 --> 00:24:25,595
- There was more than one?
- Yes.

633
00:24:25,596 --> 00:24:28,598
There was a sedan in front
and a black SUV behind it.

634
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:30,632
And it came up fast,
honking the horn,

635
00:24:30,633 --> 00:24:32,801
lights flashing--
it was totally out of control.

636
00:24:32,802 --> 00:24:33,802
Uh, the black SUV?

637
00:24:33,803 --> 00:24:35,170
Yes.

639
00:24:36,172 --> 00:24:37,305

00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:45,947
KALINDA (On speakerphone): We're not sure.
All we know is that she's

644
00:24:45,948 --> 00:24:48,750
blonde, probably in her 40s and
that she was arguing with Ludwig.

WILL:
Sounds like a jilted mistress.

646
00:24:50,285 --> 00:24:51,886
Well, we can't say
definitively.

647
00:24:51,887 --> 00:24:53,254
They had an argument.

648
00:24:53,255 --> 00:24:55,222
Maybe he broke it off,
she wasn't happy.

649
00:24:55,223 --> 00:24:57,392
She chases after him,
drives him off the road.

650
00:24:57,393 --> 00:24:59,927
- Do you believe that? - It's not what I
believe, it's what the coroner believes.

651
00:24:59,928 --> 00:25:02,029
He's already intrigued
by suicide-- let's see

if we can intrigue him
with murder. Kalinda,

653

you line up this motel clerk

Lawsuit over a biased inquest--

That is not the issue!

no foundation...

an apology...

00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:40,433
but a decision has been made
to go with Jennings/Albright.

787
00:31:40,934 --> 00:31:42,702
- You're pulling your business?
- Management has

788
00:31:42,703 --> 00:31:45,839
expressed concerns about
Lockhart/Gardner's history

789
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,941
- of pursuing big pharma with class actions.
- I have assured Mr. Agos

790
00:31:48,942 --> 00:31:50,442
that our past work
won't impede

791
00:31:50,443 --> 00:31:52,711
- our total commitment in this matter.
- Of course not.

792
00:31:52,712 --> 00:31:54,179
There's no conflict here.

793
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:56,915
That's the very point I made to
the board, but the CEO thinks

794
00:31:56,916 --> 00:31:59,050
that the optics are wrong.

795
00:31:59,051 --> 00:32:01,152
(Sighs):
This is my mistake.

796
00:32:01,153 --> 00:32:02,454
I should've prepared them.

797
00:32:02,455 --> 00:32:05,356
DIANE: Is there any way
for us to resolve this?

798
00:32:05,357 --> 00:32:06,757
I'm afraid not.

799
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,826
And I'm very sorry.

800
00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:18,335
Diane, this is...
this is a complete surprise.

801
00:32:18,336 --> 00:32:19,937
Yes.

802
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:22,038
For me, too.

803
00:32:24,675 --> 00:32:26,843
(Indistinct talking)

804
00:32:26,844 --> 00:32:28,211
Okay.

805
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:31,715
- Who's she?
- No idea.

806
00:32:31,716 --> 00:32:33,349
CLAYPOOL: Ladies and
gentlemen of the jury,

807
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:35,418
as you know, we
are now considering

808
00:32:35,419 --> 00:32:37,753
not only a theory
of accidental death

809
00:32:37,754 --> 00:32:39,989
as well as a
theory of suicide,

810
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:43,458
but also a theory,
potentially, of homicide.

811
00:32:43,459 --> 00:32:45,828
Which is why...

812
00:32:45,829 --> 00:32:48,797
Assistant State's Attorney
of Lake County Shirley Mann

813
00:32:48,798 --> 00:32:50,399
has joined us
for the duration.

814
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,500
Thank you, Mr. Claypool.

815
00:32:51,501 --> 00:32:52,834
At this time, if possible,

816
00:32:52,835 --> 00:32:55,302
I'd like to ask a few questions
of Mrs. Ludwig.

817
00:32:56,303 --> 00:32:57,705
Mr. Claypool,
I'm not sure

818
00:32:57,706 --> 00:32:59,541
how my client's testimony
is relevant

819
00:32:59,542 --> 00:33:01,242
- in this regard.
- I'm not, either.

820
00:33:01,243 --> 00:33:03,044
But the ASA has
an absolute right

821
00:33:03,045 --> 00:33:05,312
to join in these proceedings.

822
00:33:05,313 --> 00:33:07,214
Mrs. Ludwig, please.

823
00:33:07,215 --> 00:33:08,916
Make your answers short
and declarative.

824
00:33:09,417 --> 00:33:10,984
MANN:
Thank you, Mrs. Ludwig.

825
00:33:10,985 --> 00:33:13,153
I am very sorry for your loss,
and I apologize

826
00:33:13,154 --> 00:33:15,022
for having to question you
at this time.

827
00:33:15,023 --> 00:33:17,390
Now, according to the statement
you gave the police,

828
00:33:17,391 --> 00:33:20,694
you were home the night
of March 2, is that correct?

829
00:33:20,695 --> 00:33:22,162
Yes. I hadn't wanted to go

830
00:33:22,163 --> 00:33:24,264
to the dinner
my husband was attending.

831
00:33:24,265 --> 00:33:25,497
I didn't feel well.

832
00:33:25,498 --> 00:33:27,567
MANN: And you were at home
until you were notified

833
00:33:27,568 --> 00:33:28,801
of your husband's
death at approximately

834
00:33:28,802 --> 00:33:30,502
- 12:20 a.m.?
- Yes.

835
00:33:30,503 --> 00:33:32,504
Now, as Coroner Claypool
has explained,

836
00:33:32,505 --> 00:33:36,542
this is not a courtroom,
but you are still under oath.

837
00:33:36,543 --> 00:33:39,579
Do you wish to stand
by that statement?

838
00:33:41,346 --> 00:33:44,849
Mr. Claypool, I'm advising
my client to invoke her Fifth

839
00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:46,051
Amendment right not to testify.

840
00:33:46,052 --> 00:33:47,752
(Gallery murmuring)

841
00:33:47,753 --> 00:33:49,988
All... all
right, everyone.

842
00:33:50,856 --> 00:33:54,258
Mrs. Ludwig?

843
00:33:55,962 --> 00:33:58,195
On counsel's advice,

844
00:33:58,196 --> 00:34:01,198
I am invoking my Fifth Amendment
right not to answer.

845
00:34:01,199 --> 00:34:02,733
MANN:
Mrs. Ludwig, this is

846
00:34:02,734 --> 00:34:05,535
an affidavit from your neighbor
stating that he heard you

847
00:34:05,536 --> 00:34:08,772
leave on the night in question,
shortly before 10:00 p.m.,

848
00:34:08,773 --> 00:34:10,307
and that according to him,

849
00:34:10,308 --> 00:34:13,076
you didn't return
until almost midnight.

850
00:34:13,077 --> 00:34:14,877
Mrs. Ludwig, where did you go

851
00:34:14,878 --> 00:34:17,046
between 10:00 p.m.
and midnight, March 2?

852
00:34:17,047 --> 00:34:18,247
On counsel's advice,

853
00:34:18,248 --> 00:34:20,116
I am invoking
my Fifth Amendment right

854
00:34:20,117 --> 00:34:21,985
not to answer.

855
00:34:29,452 --> 00:34:31,085
So, you did know
about the affair?

856
00:34:32,086 --> 00:34:33,321
I suspected.

857
00:34:33,322 --> 00:34:34,555
I wasn't sure.

858
00:34:34,556 --> 00:34:36,357
Did you lie to the police
about your whereabouts

859
00:34:36,358 --> 00:34:37,692
at the time
of your husband's death?

860
00:34:38,693 --> 00:34:39,826
Yes.

861
00:34:40,327 --> 00:34:41,928
When he mentioned
the dinner,

862
00:34:41,929 --> 00:34:43,797
I got suspicious.
I thought about

863
00:34:43,798 --> 00:34:45,165
calling Bigelow, but I knew

864
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:47,301
I wouldn't get a straight answer
out of him.

865
00:34:47,302 --> 00:34:49,169
He and Roger were very close,

866
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:50,804
and he had covered
for Roger before.

867
00:34:50,805 --> 00:34:54,474
This wasn't the first time your
husband had been unfaithful?

868
00:34:54,975 --> 00:34:56,942
Where did you go that night,
Mrs. Ludwig?

869
00:34:56,943 --> 00:34:58,344
I drove to the
restaurant.

870
00:34:58,345 --> 00:35:00,278
W-When I saw he wasn't there,

871
00:35:00,279 --> 00:35:03,749
I drove around to a couple of
places I thought he might be.

872
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:05,417
Then I just drove around angry

873
00:35:05,418 --> 00:35:07,653
for a while, and
then, I went home.

874
00:35:07,654 --> 00:35:10,989
Then the phone rang,
and everything changed.

875
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:12,657
I know I should have told you.

876
00:35:13,358 --> 00:35:14,792
I just didn't think
that it was important,

877
00:35:14,793 --> 00:35:17,562
and I was embarrassed.

878
00:35:18,063 --> 00:35:20,197
Did I just lose this?

879
00:35:20,698 --> 00:35:23,701
It's not about losing
the insurance money anymore.

880
00:35:23,702 --> 00:35:25,903
You're in danger
of being arrested.

881
00:35:27,339 --> 00:35:29,272
Diane.

882
00:35:29,273 --> 00:35:30,540
Good to see you.

883
00:35:30,541 --> 00:35:32,108
Mr. Agos,
I wasn't expecting you.

884
00:35:32,109 --> 00:35:34,210
We received the call
from your general counsel.

885
00:35:34,211 --> 00:35:35,379
Yes, about that.

886
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:37,481
Now, look, I may have
overstepped a bit

887
00:35:37,482 --> 00:35:40,484
in trying to help out my
son, and if so, mea culpa.

888
00:35:40,485 --> 00:35:42,853
Parents are blind when it
comes to their children.

889
00:35:42,854 --> 00:35:44,787
- Indeed.
- What I'm saying is, I think

890
00:35:44,788 --> 00:35:47,456
there may be a way
for us to salvage this.

891
00:35:47,957 --> 00:35:50,592
If we could get a few more
partners on the account

892
00:35:50,593 --> 00:35:52,127
so that our GC
doesn't feel like

893
00:35:52,128 --> 00:35:54,229
we're in the hands of a
fourth-year associate.

894
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:55,530
- Mm-hmm.
- Diane?

895
00:35:55,531 --> 00:35:57,900
I'd like you to
meet Dale Dazzo,

896
00:35:57,901 --> 00:35:59,768
the CEO
of Emmonds Pharmaceuticals.

897
00:35:59,769 --> 00:36:00,935
Well, it's a pleasure.

898
00:36:00,936 --> 00:36:02,870
Cary happened to
catch me at lunch.

899
00:36:02,871 --> 00:36:06,073
He's been telling me
about your firm's lobbying work.

900
00:36:06,074 --> 00:36:08,309
And your connection
to the SA's office.

901
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:10,177
Very impressive.

902
00:36:10,178 --> 00:36:12,079
There was some nervousness

903
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:14,248
from one of our VPs,

904
00:36:14,249 --> 00:36:17,317
but I think we'd be fools
to go anywhere else.

905
00:36:18,118 --> 00:36:19,553
I couldn't agree more.

906
00:36:19,554 --> 00:36:21,154
Well, we're happy to hear that.

907
00:36:21,155 --> 00:36:23,757
Dale, Dad, welcome
to Lockhart/Gardner.

908
00:36:23,758 --> 00:36:25,225
Again.

909
00:36:25,226 --> 00:36:27,528
(Laughter)

910
00:36:27,529 --> 00:36:29,229
No, I am impressed, Cary.

911
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:32,064
I mean, that was
a remarkable save.

912
00:36:32,065 --> 00:36:33,699
And you're good
with Dazzo.

913
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:35,134
That is not easy.

914
00:36:35,135 --> 00:36:36,335
Oh, I don't know.

915
00:36:36,336 --> 00:36:38,270
He said that you're
doing pretty good, too.

916
00:36:38,271 --> 00:36:39,739
Well...

917
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:42,274
You know, we could always
work together.

918
00:36:43,275 --> 00:36:45,377
Unfortunately, Mr. Dazzo
thought it would be better

919
00:36:45,378 --> 00:36:47,579
if I worked directly
with the general counsel.

920
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,380
Without any middlemen.

921
00:36:49,381 --> 00:36:51,983
You understand?

922
00:36:51,984 --> 00:36:53,919
He didn't say that.

923
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:56,521
He did.

924
00:36:57,022 --> 00:36:58,790
You hold a grudge, don't you?

925
00:36:58,791 --> 00:37:00,826
No.

926
00:37:00,827 --> 00:37:02,961
Dad, no, I don't.

927
00:37:02,962 --> 00:37:05,429
I'm too busy to hold grudges.

928
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:07,397
Take care.

929
00:37:08,598 --> 00:37:09,934
Thanks for
the business.

930
00:37:09,935 --> 00:37:11,769
(Elevator bell dings)

931
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:14,805
KALINDA: <i>Janie Ludwig
said you and her husband</i>

932
00:37:14,806 --> 00:37:16,073
were good friends.

933
00:37:16,074 --> 00:37:17,341
We were.
(Teakettle whistling)

934
00:37:17,342 --> 00:37:19,843
Bethany and I were devastated
when we heard the news.

935
00:37:19,844 --> 00:37:21,344
(Whistling stops)

936
00:37:21,345 --> 00:37:24,046
Did he bring anyone
to dinner with him that evening?

937
00:37:24,047 --> 00:37:25,515
No, Janie didn't come.

938
00:37:25,516 --> 00:37:27,249
It was just us catching up.

939
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:29,285
We meant, anyone

940
00:37:29,286 --> 00:37:31,387
<i>besides</i> Mrs. Ludwig.

941
00:37:32,388 --> 00:37:33,857
No.

942
00:37:33,858 --> 00:37:35,124
No, no, no, no. No.

943
00:37:35,125 --> 00:37:37,058
Janie and Roger had
some rough spots,

944
00:37:37,059 --> 00:37:40,362
but that was a...
a long time ago.

945
00:37:40,363 --> 00:37:43,532
There was a colleague he was
seeing about a year ago, but

946
00:37:43,533 --> 00:37:45,667
we sat him down,
and he broke it off.

947
00:37:45,668 --> 00:37:47,168
He's been a faithful man
ever since.

948
00:37:47,169 --> 00:37:48,804
This colleague a year
ago-- was she blonde?

949
00:37:48,805 --> 00:37:50,171
(Door closing)
No. Why?

950
00:37:50,172 --> 00:37:51,739
WOMAN: Hey, babe.
Everything all right?

951
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:55,175
Just some, uh, investigators
with the Ludwigs' attorneys.

952
00:37:55,176 --> 00:37:56,844
They had some questions
about Roger.

953
00:37:56,845 --> 00:37:58,846
It's terrible
what happened.

954
00:37:58,847 --> 00:38:00,615
They think Roger might
have been murdered.

955
00:38:00,616 --> 00:38:02,182
Oh, my gosh.

956
00:38:02,683 --> 00:38:04,519
What do you think?

957
00:38:05,754 --> 00:38:08,421
I think that's a very unique
license plate.

958
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:12,592
What do you
want to do?

959
00:38:16,196 --> 00:38:18,665
(Car alarm wailing,
dog barking)

960
00:38:22,136 --> 00:38:24,336
(Door closing)

961
00:38:27,707 --> 00:38:29,742
(Two beeps,
car alarm stops)

962
00:38:29,743 --> 00:38:32,044
(Barking continues)

963
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,314
What?

964
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:38,651
You were sleeping
with Justice Ludwig,

965
00:38:39,152 --> 00:38:41,285
and you fought with him
the night he was murdered.

966
00:38:41,286 --> 00:38:43,287
- Go away.
- Ok, well, if you won't talk with us,

967
00:38:43,288 --> 00:38:44,689
we can always
talk to your husband.

968
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:47,692
Yes, Roger and I were
seeing each other,

969
00:38:47,693 --> 00:38:50,428
but I had nothing
to do with his death.

970
00:38:50,729 --> 00:38:53,565
We fought at the motel because
I was breaking up with him.

971
00:38:53,566 --> 00:38:55,499
After that,
I drove straight home.

972
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,233
Right, and can anyone
confirm that?

973
00:38:57,234 --> 00:38:59,102
My husband.

974
00:38:59,103 --> 00:39:01,872
But it will destroy my marriage.
Please.

975
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,008
We know there was
another vehicle involved.

976
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:07,110
Did you see anyone else
that night?

977
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:11,147
As I was driving the other way,

978
00:39:11,848 --> 00:39:16,619
I passed an SUV speeding,
swerving.

979
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:20,790
It was headed in
the same direction as Roger.

980
00:39:20,791 --> 00:39:22,091
And you didn't report it?

981
00:39:22,092 --> 00:39:23,292
I couldn't.

982
00:39:23,693 --> 00:39:25,427
Janie is a friend of mine.

983
00:39:36,427 --> 00:39:38,261
He was driven
off the road?

984
00:39:38,262 --> 00:39:41,664
Yes, by a drunk driver
with .10 blood alcohol.

985
00:39:42,265 --> 00:39:44,232
So, a new, new, new theory.

986
00:39:44,233 --> 00:39:46,034
I move that we skip
the preliminaries

987
00:39:46,035 --> 00:39:47,969
and just get to the man
on the grassy knoll.

988
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:49,871
Yeah, before we get
to that, Mr. Hobson,

989
00:39:49,872 --> 00:39:51,473
I need to hear this one out.

990
00:39:51,474 --> 00:39:52,907
His name is Landon Boyce.

991
00:39:52,908 --> 00:39:55,343
20 minutes after Justice Ludwig
crashed his car,

992
00:39:55,344 --> 00:39:58,913
Landon Boyce was pulled over
for a DUI on the same road.

993
00:39:58,914 --> 00:40:00,114
HOBSON:
And yet the police haven't

994
00:40:00,115 --> 00:40:01,416
said boo about any of this?

995
00:40:01,417 --> 00:40:03,250
The Lake County Police
never mentioned this DUI

996
00:40:03,251 --> 00:40:04,585
because they didn't
know about it.

997
00:40:04,586 --> 00:40:06,187
The arrest happened two
miles into Cook County.

998
00:40:06,188 --> 00:40:08,655
HOBSON: The only thing this proves
is that some guy on the same

999
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:10,256
stretch of highway
got hit with a DUI.

1000
00:40:10,257 --> 00:40:11,458
There's nothing
to suggest he drove

1001
00:40:11,459 --> 00:40:12,592
the judge off the road.

1002
00:40:12,593 --> 00:40:14,127
ALICIA: Mr. Claypool,
we'd like to submit

1003
00:40:14,128 --> 00:40:16,095
the EDR from Mr. Boyce's SUV.

1004
00:40:16,096 --> 00:40:16,930
E.D...?

1005
00:40:16,931 --> 00:40:18,097
ALICIA:
Event data recorder.

1006
00:40:18,098 --> 00:40:19,466
It's like
the little

1007
00:40:19,467 --> 00:40:20,500
black box for a car.

1008
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:23,269
11:42 p.m.,
the exact moment

1009
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:25,571
of the judge's
accident, the EDR shows

1010
00:40:25,572 --> 00:40:28,040
Mr. Boyce's SUV
swerved and braked hard,

1011
00:40:28,041 --> 00:40:31,310
coming to a full stop
<i>before</i> accelerating again.

1012
00:40:31,311 --> 00:40:34,780
Justice Ludwig swerved
to avoid being hit and

1013
00:40:34,781 --> 00:40:36,449
crashed into
the guardrail.

1014
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:38,116
CLAYPOOL:
Well,

1015
00:40:38,117 --> 00:40:43,521
Mr. Hobson, of all the theories
I've heard from both sides,

1016
00:40:43,522 --> 00:40:45,657
this is the first one

1017
00:40:45,658 --> 00:40:48,593
that's had something
resembling hard evidence.

1018
00:40:48,594 --> 00:40:51,663
I'm gonna let
the jury hear it.

1019
00:40:53,965 --> 00:40:56,000
I never expected them to settle.

1020
00:40:56,001 --> 00:40:58,301
Certainly not
for the full amount.

1021
00:40:58,302 --> 00:41:00,437
Wilk Hobson couldn't risk it
going to a jury.

1022
00:41:00,438 --> 00:41:02,138
If they'd ruled
it was an accident,

1023
00:41:02,139 --> 00:41:04,207
Wolf & Bland would have had
to pay double.

1024
00:41:04,208 --> 00:41:05,342
We're just sorry
about everything

1025
00:41:05,343 --> 00:41:07,043
that was laid out
on the table.

1026
00:41:07,044 --> 00:41:09,812
There's no need to be sorry
about the truth.

1027
00:41:12,916 --> 00:41:14,251
A victory all around.

1028
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:16,219
Yup.

1029
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:18,288
I'll see you at the
Chicago Shamrock Dinner?

1030
00:41:18,289 --> 00:41:20,522
Yes.

1031
00:41:20,523 --> 00:41:22,557
You do know
it's white tie, right?

1032
00:41:23,258 --> 00:41:25,160
What?

1033
00:41:27,863 --> 00:41:28,898
What's going on here?

1034
00:41:29,399 --> 00:41:30,565
I'm going.

1035
00:41:30,566 --> 00:41:33,102
You're going?
Where are you going?

1036
00:41:33,103 --> 00:41:37,471
Come on. You set me up,
and I didn't even see it coming.

1037
00:41:37,472 --> 00:41:39,073
Nicely played.

1038
00:41:39,074 --> 00:41:40,408
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

1039
00:41:40,409 --> 00:41:41,509
Peter relieved me.

1040
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:43,111
Got involved
in the family business,

1041
00:41:43,112 --> 00:41:45,980
so he asked me
to take a step back.

1042
00:41:45,981 --> 00:41:49,650
Gosh. That's terrible.

1043
00:41:49,651 --> 00:41:51,819
- And all I wanted to do was
help him win, Eli.     - Yeah.

1044
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:53,353
That's all you wanted to do.

1045
00:41:53,354 --> 00:41:54,721
Some people
aren't like you.

1046
00:41:54,722 --> 00:41:56,957
We're too busy dealing
with politics in the field

1047
00:41:56,958 --> 00:41:58,392
to want politics in the office.

1048
00:41:58,393 --> 00:42:00,693
Hold on, let me write that down.

1049
00:42:00,694 --> 00:42:02,629
Good luck, Eli.

1050
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:05,098
You're gonna die a sad
and lonely old man

1051
00:42:05,099 --> 00:42:06,400
'cause you don't trust anyone.

1052
00:42:06,401 --> 00:42:09,968
The Florrick campaign thanks you
for your contribution. Good-bye.

1053
00:42:09,969 --> 00:42:11,037
GRACE:
<i>Wow!</i>

1054
00:42:11,038 --> 00:42:12,871
You look like
a princess.

1055
00:42:12,872 --> 00:42:16,542
This was marked down 60%,
so, thank you.

1056
00:42:16,943 --> 00:42:19,178
Nice, Mom.

1057
00:42:19,179 --> 00:42:20,313
Grandma Veronica called.

1058
00:42:20,314 --> 00:42:21,780
She said she's stopping by

1059
00:42:21,781 --> 00:42:24,049
before she goes
to her St. Patrick's Day party.

1060
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:26,150
Ooh, that should be fun.

1061
00:42:26,151 --> 00:42:27,952
You want us
to hide the alcohol?

1062
00:42:27,953 --> 00:42:29,320
It's St. Patrick's
Day in Chicago.

1063
00:42:29,321 --> 00:42:30,555
Hiding it won't make
a difference.

1064
00:42:30,556 --> 00:42:31,689
GRACE:
Have fun tonight.

1065
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:33,391
- Love you.
- Love you, too.

1066
00:42:34,961 --> 00:42:36,461
What happened with Nisa?

1067
00:42:36,962 --> 00:42:38,863
- Oh, it's okay, Mom.
- No.

1068
00:42:38,864 --> 00:42:41,865
Zach, the campaign,
these campaigns-- they...

1069
00:42:45,503 --> 00:42:48,605
You date whoever you want.

1070
00:42:48,606 --> 00:42:50,307
It really is okay, Mom.

1071
00:42:50,308 --> 00:42:51,976
I was going to break
up with her anyways.

1072
00:42:51,977 --> 00:42:54,811
No, Zach,
the campaign will survive.

1073
00:42:54,812 --> 00:42:55,512
Seriously,

1074
00:42:55,513 --> 00:42:57,280
I-I was going
to break up with her.

1075
00:42:58,281 --> 00:42:59,382
College is right
around the corner,

1076
00:42:59,383 --> 00:43:02,185
and she wanted to
get more serious.

1077
00:43:02,486 --> 00:43:04,520
Go to your party. I'm fine.
