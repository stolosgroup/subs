1
00:00:05,405 --> 00:00:07,999
I was devastated.

2
00:00:08,808 --> 00:00:11,242
All my life savings.

3
00:00:12,245 --> 00:00:14,076
They were gone.

4
00:00:14,614 --> 00:00:16,445
Just like that.

5
00:00:17,217 --> 00:00:18,275
Because of him.

6
00:00:19,285 --> 00:00:21,344
CARY: The defendant? You blame him
for this pyramid scheme?

7
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:23,318
Objection. Calls for speculation.

8
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,651
Mrs. Florrick,
can we save our objections

9
00:00:25,825 --> 00:00:27,292
for issues that really matter?

10
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,951
I'm just trying to keep the prosecution
honest, Your Honor.

11
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:31,620
CUESTA:
Oh, sure, why not?

12
00:00:31,798 --> 00:00:35,290
Well, I'm in a good mood today,
so I'll sustain that.

13
00:00:38,738 --> 00:00:42,367
I'm, uh, sorry to do this,
ladies and gentlemen.

14
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:45,136
I'll need attorneys in chambers.

15
00:00:45,311 --> 00:00:49,475
And, sheriff, if you would
return the jury to the jury room, please.

16
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:51,974
CUESTA:
Looks like it might rain, right?

17
00:00:53,653 --> 00:00:56,645
Uh, yes, Your Honor,
by this afternoon.

18
00:00:56,823 --> 00:00:59,087
Yeah, I was in Mexico in April.
Not a drop.

19
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:01,284
Uh, was Mexico beautiful?

20
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:03,793
I liked it. I liked it a lot.

21
00:01:03,963 --> 00:01:05,726
I'm declaring a mistrial.

22
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:08,629
DIANE: Excuse me, Your Honor?
CARY: I've spent two weeks on this.

23
00:01:08,802 --> 00:01:10,929
Did I say that you could all talk?

24
00:01:12,338 --> 00:01:13,965
This is not about you.

25
00:01:14,374 --> 00:01:16,467
I have been put in the penalty box.

26
00:01:16,976 --> 00:01:19,001
You'll be assigned a new judge
in a month.

27
00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:21,579
I have been transferred
to the 13th floor,

28
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:25,809
and all my cases will be reassigned
as of 11 a.m. This morning. Great.

29
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:28,418
I'm sorry, Your Honor.

30
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:31,079
Yeah, a 15-year judicial career
down the drain.

31
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:32,918
But, hey, politics is politics.

32
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:35,186
Stop crying, Judy.

33
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:37,358
So you're all dismissed.

34
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:41,057
You can all go and gossip
to all your lawyer friends.

35
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,931
Ms. Lockhart, could you stay?

36
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,105
Don't worry, it's not ex parte.

37
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:51,300
The trial is over.

38
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:53,105
Get out.

39
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:56,845
You can head out too, Judy.

40
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:01,781
Ms. Lockhart, have a seat.

41
00:02:08,728 --> 00:02:09,888
I need a lawyer.

42
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:19,537
- And what is the case?
- You agree to take it?

43
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:23,576
No. I need to know the case first.

44
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,036
[SIGHS]

45
00:02:27,213 --> 00:02:29,943
I was a prosecutor 20 years ago.

46
00:02:30,116 --> 00:02:32,744
I put a wife-killer in prison.

47
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:36,582
And now a recent DNA test has proved
that he might not be guilty.

48
00:02:36,756 --> 00:02:38,815
And they're looking
at how I handled the prosecution.

49
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,892
They're saying I kept things
from the defense.

50
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,357
And that's why the penalty box?

51
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:45,498
Yes. I'm being investigated
by the state's attorney.

52
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:48,566
I've been transferred
to review pauper petitions

53
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:50,930
until such time as I am cleared.

54
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:56,208
I want you to know that Mrs. Florrick
has no sway over her husband.

55
00:02:57,577 --> 00:03:00,808
Ms. Lockhart, you don't know me,
do you?

56
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:05,110
I'm not hiring you
for your political connections.

57
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:07,310
I'm hiring you because
I respected the way

58
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:11,924
that Mr. Gardner battled his recent
judicial bribery accusations.

59
00:03:12,091 --> 00:03:15,060
Now, do you think I should be getting
another lawyer?

60
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:18,163
I'm not sure it's a good idea.
We said we're overburdened as it is.

61
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:20,697
No new clients
until we hire a new litigator.

62
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,698
A judge
is when you make an exception.

63
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:26,100
Why? We represent Cuesta,
he'll have to recuse himself

64
00:03:26,272 --> 00:03:28,206
from any future cases
we have before him.

65
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:31,468
WILL: But it's the halo effect. Other
judges will know we have their back.

66
00:03:32,645 --> 00:03:35,113
- Howard, everything all right?
- Yeah.

67
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:37,146
I saw you having a meeting
of the name partners,

68
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:39,808
and I thought since
I'm a name partner, I should be here.

69
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:44,656
Okay. Uh, we were just talking about
whether to take on a new client.

70
00:03:44,824 --> 00:03:46,587
- A judge.
- What kind of judge?

71
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:49,886
A criminal judge.

72
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:53,123
- Oh, criminal. Sounds smart.
- Mm-hm.

73
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:55,767
Okay, it's settled. We should take on
Judge Cuesta as a client.

74
00:03:55,935 --> 00:03:57,664
Howard approves.

75
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,895
Then we'll have to hire
a new litigator.

76
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,438
Howard, isn't that a good idea?

77
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:03,667
Litigator, yeah.
Got a few names if you want.

78
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:06,403
Actually, Alicia had a suggestion.

79
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:07,875
Cary Agos.

80
00:04:08,047 --> 00:04:09,981
Alicia? Who's Alicia?

81
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:11,844
Uh, I am.

82
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:13,007
- Oh. Hi.
ALICIA: Hi.

83
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:16,246
Uh, Cary's been demoted
at the State's Attorney's Office.

84
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:17,514
He's ready to make the jump.

85
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,920
But are we ready to be jumped?

86
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,118
I've worked on 140 cases
since I've been away.

87
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:24,593
And I've learned a lot about myself
and the law.

88
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:27,959
DIANE: We're a bit shorthanded
at the moment, Cary.

89
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:29,465
We need someone immediately.

90
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:31,467
Will that work for you?

91
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:35,472
Well, I'd need to offer two weeks'
notice, but, uh, otherwise, yes.

92
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:37,633
Why are you leaving
the State's Attorney's Office?

93
00:04:38,511 --> 00:04:40,138
My responsibilities
have been curtailed.

94
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:42,838
- I wanted to face greater challenges.
- Why curtailed?

95
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:46,645
Unfortunately,
I'm not in a position to answer that.

96
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:48,844
That's confidential
state's attorney business.

97
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:51,490
- But it shouldn't worry us?
- No.

98
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:53,819
No, Peter will give me a very strong
recommendation.

99
00:04:53,993 --> 00:04:57,292
WILL: You won't have any difficulty
going up against your old boss?

100
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,158
Didn't have any difficulty going up
against you two.

101
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:01,163
[CHUCKLES]

102
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:06,395
Will, I'm sorry about how all that
went down the last few months.

103
00:05:06,572 --> 00:05:08,164
You mean, the attempted indictment
of me?

104
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:09,365
CARY:
Yes.

105
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:12,602
I want you to know
I was assigned that prosecution.

106
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:14,644
I never would have chosen it.

107
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:21,914
Who would you most want
to spend time with on a desert island?

108
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:29,023
- Hey.
- Hey, thanks.

109
00:05:29,195 --> 00:05:30,890
They said you put in a good word
for me.

110
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:33,589
You're getting hard to beat in court.
Better to have you here.

111
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:36,929
- How'd it go?
- Good, I think, but I don't wanna jinx it.

112
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:39,863
Don't tell Peter, by the way.
I haven't told him yet.

113
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:41,904
No problem.

114
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,373
He's everything we need right now.
A go-getter.

115
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:49,708
Knows the ins and outs
of the State's Attorney's Office.

116
00:05:49,882 --> 00:05:52,851
The conflicts of interest here
could sink a battleship.

117
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,351
Are we really suddenly worried
about conflicts of interests?

118
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:57,512
We face 50 between here
and the elevator.

119
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,716
- I say we hire him.
- I disagree.

120
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:07,123
Howard?

121
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,663
Is he gay?

122
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:13,194
He only wants to take boys
to a desert island.

123
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:14,635
That's why I'm asking.

124
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:18,068
Thurgood Marshall
and Keith Richards?

125
00:06:18,244 --> 00:06:20,804
Hmm. No girls.

126
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,747
That bothered me.

127
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:25,883
I see.

128
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:29,886
And did that, uh, bother you too, Will?

129
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,149
Well, I'm glad we've reached
such a sensible decision.

130
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:34,350
If we don't find someone better,
we go back to Cary.

131
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:36,654
Sounds sensible to me.

132
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:41,028
- Is Judge Cuesta coming here today?
- Yes.

133
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,792
We discuss strategy in a half hour.

134
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:45,804
Which is when I have a sit-down
with LeMond Bishop.

135
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:51,474
The city's top meth dealer
in the waiting room with its top judge.

136
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:54,477
Yes, that qualifies
as awkward scheduling.

137
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,749
ELl:
I still think you can keep your stance.

138
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:02,752
- Well, then why are we arguing?
PETER: <i>We're not arguing.</i>

139
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:05,447
I just don't like being told
what I'm doing is politically smart

140
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:07,490
- when I'm doing it anyway.
- <i>Okay, Peter.</i>

141
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:10,493
You're making an ethically
courageous decision. How's that?

142
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:13,861
When did we become
an old bickering couple?

143
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:19,061
Oh, hey, did you kick out that kid,
uh, Cary What's-His-Name?

144
00:07:19,238 --> 00:07:20,830
- <i>Did I what?</i>
- That kid.

145
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:23,100
I saw him here at Lockhart Gardner
looking for a job.

146
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,369
- <i>Cary something.</i>
- Cary Agos?

147
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:27,775
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah,</i>
<i>I saw him here being interviewed.</i>

148
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:30,211
<i>I didn't know</i>
<i>you were letting him go.</i>

149
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:35,085
Terri Rooney, 24 years old,
stabbed to death in 1992.

150
00:07:35,254 --> 00:07:37,154
She was pregnant,
he didn't want a baby,

151
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:40,520
so he insured her for $850,000
and he killed her.

152
00:07:40,693 --> 00:07:44,652
Her husband, Patrick, said he returned
home from the supermarket

153
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:47,265
to find her mutilated with a knife
taken from the kitchen...

154
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:49,663
But no one at the supermarket
remembered him.

155
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:51,804
- He had no receipt.
- Yes, it was a weak alibi...

156
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:55,907
Try nonexistent. And look, he had her
blood on his shirt and his jacket.

157
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:58,066
Defense claimed
it was from attempts to revive her.

158
00:07:58,244 --> 00:08:00,109
As were the defensive wounds
on his face?

159
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:02,804
Okay, we're not here to retry this,
Your Honor.

160
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,847
Mr. Rooney's sentence
has been vacated,

161
00:08:05,017 --> 00:08:06,484
and he has been released.
Why is that?

162
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:09,280
The killer's hand thrust down
on the sharp edge of the knife

163
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:11,184
when he stabbed her,
leaving his blood.

164
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:15,726
It was never tested for DNA until his
appellate lawyers petitioned it last year.

165
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:19,796
- Turns out it was somebody else's.
- Look, we didn't test DNA back then.

166
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:22,867
Patrick Rooney was released last
August when the DNA matched a...

167
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:25,299
Just to be clear, I did nothing less
than any prosecutor...

168
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:27,962
Yes, yes, just to be clear.

169
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,802
This isn't your court, Your Honor.
This is our offices.

170
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:32,740
You need to drop the entitlement.

171
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:34,846
Excuse me?
I thought I was explaining myself.

172
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,879
You are acting as if
you were the injured party.

173
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:38,812
I have been barred from the bench,
ma'am.

174
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:40,452
- And I have done nothing wrong.
- No.

175
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,783
Patrick Rooney did nothing wrong
and he spent 20 years in prison for it.

176
00:08:43,956 --> 00:08:45,753
He had his wife snatched from him.

177
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:47,790
And then he was accused
of her murder.

178
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:51,120
Your attitude, Your Honor,

179
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:53,288
it will do more to condemn you
than the evidence.

180
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,534
You're on this side
of the bench now.

181
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:58,932
You have to show humility.

182
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:03,770
Continue.

183
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:09,237
A court of inquiry is being commenced
in two days

184
00:09:09,415 --> 00:09:12,543
to review the evidence
against His Honor

185
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:14,709
and decide if criminal charges
should be brought.

186
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:17,048
Why a court of inquiry?

187
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,555
My guess is due to the personal
animosity of the players.

188
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,784
All right, well, it still needs a judge.

189
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:23,952
Your Honor knows most of the judges
in Cook County.

190
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:26,724
They'll have to recuse themselves.
So who?

191
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,495
Would you excuse me?

192
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:31,603
WILL: Which leaves me with two
months left on my suspension.

193
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:33,602
Still, I want you to know, Mr. Bishop,

194
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:37,209
your team is intact
and firing on all cylinders.

195
00:09:37,376 --> 00:09:40,140
- And how are you doing?
- How am I doing?

196
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:42,804
I'm good, thank you.
I just worry about my clients.

197
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:46,310
I'm fine. I don't think a lawyer's
working hard enough

198
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:49,215
unless they get into a little legal trouble
now and then.

199
00:09:49,388 --> 00:09:50,946
Damon is handling your tax issues.

200
00:09:51,123 --> 00:09:52,954
Roger, your trust.
Mark and Eve, your criminal.

201
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:55,184
And Jordan and Alicia,
your civil litigation.

202
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:58,990
- Mrs. Florrick, hello.
ALICIA: Mr. Bishop.

203
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:00,655
How am I doing civilly?

204
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:04,064
- Well, sir. No complaints.
- Good.

205
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:07,137
Actually, where is that little
investigator you have?

206
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:09,900
Kalinda? I think she's in another
meeting, but we can get her.

207
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:11,100
BISHOP:
Please.

208
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:15,043
In fact, could I have a quick word with
Mrs. Florrick and Kalinda in private?

209
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:18,278
We've represented lawyers before,
Your Honor,

210
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:21,181
and they all share one trait:
Backseat driving.

211
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:23,652
They have trouble letting us
drive their defense.

212
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:27,554
I will, uh, endeavor to behave.

213
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:30,252
[WHISPERS]
Mr. Bishop wants to talk to us.

214
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,057
You can give us a minute too,
Mr. Gardner.

215
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:38,568
- You sure?
- Yeah, legal stuff.

216
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:42,174
You can't be helping on it anyway.
Your suspension.

217
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:50,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

218
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:56,982
I was approached by an FBI agent
named Lana Delaney.

219
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:00,589
She seems to think
I have some tax issues

220
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,285
due to some work you did for me.

221
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:08,829
When did she approach you?

222
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:14,862
I was surprised by this, of course.

223
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:18,505
I didn't remember you had done
work for me.

224
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:23,547
And I was surprised to have
an FBI agent approach me at all.

225
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:25,843
Yeah, I'm surprised too.

226
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:27,610
But you don't pay me
to be your client.

227
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:30,478
I pay you.

228
00:11:30,956 --> 00:11:33,288
I pay you not to be surprised.

229
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:36,325
That's my fault, sir.

230
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:40,829
Due to attorney-client privilege, I was
limited in what I could share with you.

231
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:44,926
You're only limited if she tells you
to be limited, right?

232
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:46,833
Yes.

233
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:48,868
BISHOP:
So, what's my exposure?

234
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,610
We're taking care of it.

235
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,545
Listen to me.

236
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:03,417
I don't like the FBI coming to me.

237
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:05,857
So take care of it.

238
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:07,952
Fast.

239
00:12:09,261 --> 00:12:11,126
Are we understanding?

240
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:12,525
We are.

241
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:24,504
- That wasn't good.
- No.

242
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:27,808
Your FBI friend's
gonna get you killed.

243
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:45,258
No word yet on a judge?

244
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:48,696
No, it's still a political hot potato. The
suspicion is they'll choose by lottery.

245
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:50,529
KLINENBERG:
Ms. Lockhart.

246
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,029
Counselor.

247
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:55,267
Judge Cuesta.

248
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,739
Seth. They put you on this?

249
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,377
No, I volunteered, Your Honor.

250
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:00,876
Oh, how nice.

251
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:03,480
And Brutus volunteered
to govern Gaul.

252
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:06,447
If nobody stepped up,
justice would not be served.

253
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:07,881
So I stepped up.

254
00:13:08,053 --> 00:13:09,816
Mm. Always watch out
for the true believers.

255
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:11,422
SHERIFF:
All stand.

256
00:13:12,057 --> 00:13:14,184
Special court of inquiry
is now in session.

257
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,624
The Honorable Murphy Wicks
presiding.

258
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,889
- Who the heck is...?
WICKS: Hey there.

259
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:23,526
Oh, please,
you can all sit on down. Heh.

260
00:13:23,702 --> 00:13:28,935
Uh, I'm new to this court, so things
may go a little slowly at first here.

261
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:31,542
I'm Judge Murphy Wicks.

262
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:33,837
"Murph" is fine with me.

263
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:35,640
I'm from downstate, Harrisburg.

264

"Gateway to the
Shawnee National Forest."

Population, 10,790.

266
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:46,191
- Yep.
- Oh, my gosh, he's an idiot.

267
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:48,383
ALICIA:
<i>So our defense is simple.</i>

268
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:50,927
Prosecutorial discretion
is not misconduct.

269
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:53,087
You cannot convict a prosecutor

270
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:56,166
for the choices he makes
in pursuing a prosecution.

271
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:59,270
- Good. And Kalinda's on the judge?
- She's checking his background.

272
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:02,805
But it seems he's exactly what he says,
just a small-town judge.

273
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:05,569
Alicia, what do you think
of Callie Simko?

274
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:07,735
Callie from our last case?

275
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:10,848
Good, a bit cutthroat, but smart.
Why?

276
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:13,280
What do you think of her coming here
to Lockhart Gardner?

277
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,149
- In addition to Cary?
- No.

278
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:17,983
Well, I don't know. Maybe.

279
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:24,788
She's smart.
I can't speak to how she'd fit in.

280
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:27,125
Okay, thanks.

281
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:30,792
DIANE:
So, Callie, tell us about your life.

282
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:33,632
Basically, I have no life.
Heh-heh.

283
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:35,296
I live for litigation.

284
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:37,738
And you were suspended for a year?

285
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:40,879
Yes, I had some overbilling issues.

286
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:42,911
Mostly because
I had a cocaine habit.

287
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:48,776
I know. I think it's best
to state that right at the top.

288
00:14:48,954 --> 00:14:51,081
For the last two years,
I've been in recovery.

289
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:55,660
If you have any doubt, you should talk
to my past employer and my clients.

290
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:57,728
Thank you. I will.

291

And, uh, why are you leaving
Hockney and Barnes?

292
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:04,297
Too big. Too corporate.
Too many fiefdoms.

293
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,438
And one more reason. You.

294
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:08,938
- Me?
CALLIE: Yes.

295

Okay. I guess...

00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,798
- Yo-Yo Ma, with his cello.
- Mm-hm, mm-hm.

301

Good choices for a deserted island.

Yes.

- No, Mr. Klinenberg. Go ahead, ma'am.

465
00:24:41,246 --> 00:24:44,875
Did they offer you leniency
in trade for your testimony?

466
00:24:47,853 --> 00:24:50,151
Well, they offered to speak
at my parole hearing,

467
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:51,346
if that's what you mean,

468
00:24:51,523 --> 00:24:53,218
but I wouldn't call that paying,
you know?

469
00:24:53,391 --> 00:24:57,691
- It's just what friends do for friends.
- Okay, thank you, Mr. Peel.

470
00:24:57,863 --> 00:24:59,888
We don't need anything more
from you.

471
00:25:02,133 --> 00:25:05,569
- That was nicely done.
- Thank you, Your Honor.

472
00:25:07,272 --> 00:25:10,298
- You what?
- I'm dating her.

473
00:25:11,476 --> 00:25:16,106
- You're dating Callie Simko?
- Yes. Just recently.

474
00:25:17,649 --> 00:25:21,608
Will, l... I don't mean to intrude,

475
00:25:21,786 --> 00:25:23,913
but could you please
keep your pants zipped?

476
00:25:24,089 --> 00:25:26,250
I didn't know you were bringing her in
for an interview.

477
00:25:26,424 --> 00:25:28,119
If you had invited me in
for the interview...

478
00:25:28,293 --> 00:25:30,818
I'm the problem. The only reason
we're interviewing anyone at all

479
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:33,624
is because you vetoed Cary.

480
00:25:34,132 --> 00:25:36,100
She's good, isn't she?

481
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:38,031
- Callie?
- Yes.

482
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:39,864
Howard liked her.

483
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:42,233
She wanted men
on her deserted island.

484
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,276
Okay. Let me figure something out.

485
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:51,106
See, they really don't
include you in the group.

486
00:25:51,283 --> 00:25:53,274
- Mm.
- They're using you.

487
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:57,213
So, uh, what do I do?

488
00:25:57,389 --> 00:26:02,349
Well, Julius Cain and I would like you
to join us in voting Will out.

489
00:26:03,528 --> 00:26:05,553
I'm embarrassed to say
I used to be a heavy smoker.

490
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:09,188
- I'm embarrassed to say I still am.
- You're kidding, Your Honor.

491
00:26:09,367 --> 00:26:10,664
- You're killing yourself.
- Yeah.

492
00:26:10,835 --> 00:26:12,598
My wife says she'll kick me out
unless I quit.

493
00:26:12,771 --> 00:26:15,501
CAROL: Have you tried the patch?
WICKS: No. But I will.

494
00:26:15,674 --> 00:26:18,302
- Anyway, you were the jury foreman?
CAROL: Yes.

495
00:26:18,476 --> 00:26:20,103
I was one of the holdouts
for not guilty.

496
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:22,246
But you changed your vote
to guilty.

497
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:24,348
I'm sorry, Your Honor,
do you mind if I take over?

498
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:25,642
- Please.
- Yes.

499
00:26:25,817 --> 00:26:27,614
Once I voted guilty,
we were unanimous.

500
00:26:27,786 --> 00:26:29,083
And why did you change your vote?

501
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:33,623
There was this smoking area,
a little courtyard outside the jury room,

502
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:36,818
and I saw some evidence there
during our last lunch break.

503
00:26:36,995 --> 00:26:39,020
At first, I thought
it was left there accidentally.

504
00:26:39,197 --> 00:26:40,630
KLINENBERG:
And what was that evidence?

505
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:44,895
Photos of the husband, Mr. Rooney,
the accused, covered with blood.

506
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:47,698
KLINENBERG: This was evidence
that was excluded from the trial

507
00:26:47,872 --> 00:26:49,533
because it was considered
prejudicial?

508
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:51,972
CAROL: Yes. I guess we weren't
supposed to see it.

509
00:26:52,143 --> 00:26:55,112
And why do you say that this evidence
wasn't left there accidentally?

510
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,304
Because I saw that man,

511
00:26:56,481 --> 00:26:59,416
the prosecutor over there, leaving
the evidence there in the courtyard.

512
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:02,719
Well, I didn't do that.
I would never do that.

513
00:27:02,887 --> 00:27:04,548
We could play off faulty vision.

514
00:27:04,723 --> 00:27:07,385
- The foreman used to wear glasses.
ALICIA: It'll be hard to undercut her.

515
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:08,958
Judge Wicks believed her.

516
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,689
You had a co-counsel on the case,
Your Honor?

517
00:27:13,865 --> 00:27:16,095
Yes, an ASA I supervised. Why?

518
00:27:16,267 --> 00:27:19,703
I saw a photo of him
in the file somewhere.

519
00:27:19,871 --> 00:27:21,361
CUESTA:
Yes, that's Lloyd Bullock.

520
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:23,700
But he had nothing to do
with the crime scene evidence.

521
00:27:23,875 --> 00:27:27,902
- He was a good man.
- You were balding then too in 1992?

522
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:30,547
He had nothing to do
with the crime scene evidence.

523
00:27:30,715 --> 00:27:34,014
Yes, but during deliberations,
you weren't in complete control

524
00:27:34,185 --> 00:27:37,052
- of that evidence.
- No, I was.

525
00:27:37,222 --> 00:27:39,782
Your Honor, they're saying
that you leaked excluded evidence

526
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:42,552
to the jury to win a verdict
against an innocent man.

527
00:27:42,727 --> 00:27:45,525
- Which you did not do. Right?
CUESTA: That's correct.

528
00:27:45,697 --> 00:27:47,892
Then we need to point our finger
at someone else.

529
00:27:48,066 --> 00:27:49,658
Yes, but not at someone
who's innocent.

530
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:51,563
Well, how do you know
he was innocent?

531
00:27:51,736 --> 00:27:54,398
I mean, this was a photo
that was leaked.

532
00:27:54,572 --> 00:27:57,769
You had access to it.
Your co-counsel had access to it.

533
00:27:57,942 --> 00:28:01,503
He was with me during deliberations.
That's how I know that he didn't do it.

534
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,375
- During the whole deliberations?
CUESTA: Yes.

535
00:28:03,548 --> 00:28:05,209
- And you know that for a fact?
- I do.

536
00:28:05,383 --> 00:28:07,317
He didn't leave once,
even to go to the restroom?

537
00:28:07,485 --> 00:28:10,181
Oh, come on, what is this,
the third grade?

538
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:12,915
I'm not naive, I know what you're
doing. You're defense attorneys.

539
00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:15,321
You poke holes
in the prosecution's case,

540
00:28:15,493 --> 00:28:17,859
which is everything
I've been disgusted by my entire life.

541
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:19,121
Playing games with the truth.

542
00:28:19,297 --> 00:28:21,231
When you're back on the bench,
be disgusted again.

543
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:22,866
For the moment,
we need to defend you,

544
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:24,729
or you won't get back on the bench.

545
00:28:27,338 --> 00:28:31,297
Hey, Callie, I'm not gonna be able
to make it tonight.

546
00:28:32,077 --> 00:28:33,271
Yeah, sorry.

547
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:35,743
Family stuff. Yeah.

548
00:28:36,648 --> 00:28:38,775
Yeah, talk to you.

549
00:28:45,757 --> 00:28:48,225
- What do you think?
- Don't touch it.

550
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:50,725
It'll take care of itself.

551
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:53,193
My name is Lloyd Bullock.
I was an ASA

552
00:28:53,364 --> 00:28:56,128
and His Honor Cuesta's co-counsel
in 1992.

553
00:28:56,301 --> 00:28:57,859
- Hey, Richard.
- Lloyd.

554
00:28:58,036 --> 00:29:01,403
And you looked nothing
like you do now back then.

555
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:05,236
- Heh. Well, we've all gotten older.
- Not all of us.

556
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:08,470
I'm sorry to be delving into this, sir,
but your hair...

557
00:29:08,646 --> 00:29:09,943
Objection, Your Honor, relevance.

558
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:11,912
I see where Ms. Florrick
is going with this.

559
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:15,416
- You used to be bald, Mr. Bullock?
- Balding.

560
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:18,249
- Yes, this is a hair weave.
- A very good one.

561
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:22,359
Thank you. I'm in real estate now.
It's almost an occupational necessity.

562
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:26,327
So you used to look
a bit like Judge Cuesta in 1992?

563
00:29:27,031 --> 00:29:29,192
Yeah, I guess.
With glasses, my hairline...

564
00:29:29,367 --> 00:29:31,961
And you were a smoker back then
in 1992, weren't you?

565
00:29:32,137 --> 00:29:33,934
BULLOCK:
Yes. Not a heavy one, but, yes.

566
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:36,471
And so you had access
to the courtyard smoking area

567
00:29:36,641 --> 00:29:39,337
- outside the jury room?
- Yeah, it was the one smoking area.

568
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:42,207
And you were left in charge of all
the evidence during deliberations?

569
00:29:44,349 --> 00:29:45,714
No.

570
00:29:45,884 --> 00:29:48,580
ALICIA: You weren't in charge
of the prosecutorial evidence?

571
00:29:48,753 --> 00:29:49,777
No.

572
00:29:53,391 --> 00:29:56,019
My mistake.
But you did have access to it.

573
00:29:56,194 --> 00:29:57,786
And you were to keep charge
of admissible

574
00:29:57,962 --> 00:29:58,986
and inadmissible evidence.

575
00:29:59,164 --> 00:30:02,133
I think they're trying to suggest
you left some inadmissible evidence

576
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:05,133
in the smoking area to be seen
by a juror. Is that what happened?

577
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:07,430
BULLOCK: No, Your Honor.
- No further questions.

578
00:30:07,605 --> 00:30:09,072
WICKS:
Yeah, well, I have a few.

579
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:12,175
Mr. Bullock, did you go out
in that courtyard during deliberations?

580
00:30:12,343 --> 00:30:13,367
No, Your Honor.

581
00:30:13,545 --> 00:30:14,603
Where were you?

582
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:18,078
With Mr. Cuesta.
We were together the whole time.

583
00:30:18,249 --> 00:30:19,443
WICKS: That true, Judge?
- Objection.

584
00:30:19,617 --> 00:30:21,482
Judge Cuesta isn't on the stand,
Your Honor.

585
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:25,145
Yes, and if this were a trial
and not a court of inquiry,

586
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:27,086
I wouldn't be doing this.
But I am doing this.

587
00:30:27,258 --> 00:30:29,726
Your Honor, as one judge to another,

588
00:30:29,894 --> 00:30:32,021
was Mr. Bullock with you
during deliberations

589
00:30:32,197 --> 00:30:35,598
and therefore unable to leave this
excluded evidence for a juror?

590
00:30:41,873 --> 00:30:44,239
Yes, Your Honor. He was with me.

591
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:48,106
WICKS: For the whole deliberations?
- Yes, for the whole deliberations.

592
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,570
[SIGHS]

593
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:53,141
Thank you.

594
00:30:53,318 --> 00:30:55,843
- You can excuse this witness.
- Just a few questions.

595
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,147
Quit while you're ahead,
Mr. Klinenberg.

596
00:31:06,397 --> 00:31:10,697
These are the checks in question
from Mr. Bishop's corporation.

597
00:31:11,236 --> 00:31:13,932
But this is a copy of an email
from Will Gardner.

598
00:31:14,105 --> 00:31:17,336
You will note that it is dated
three weeks prior to the first check.

599
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:21,008
"Kalinda, the client asked me
to have you look into matters

600
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:24,114
we discussed at the meeting.
Please keep me posted.

601
00:31:24,282 --> 00:31:27,274
Thanks, Will." Seriously?

602
00:31:27,452 --> 00:31:29,977
It was work done for Lockhart
Gardner and, as such, it is covered

603
00:31:30,154 --> 00:31:33,123
- by attorney-client privilege.
- If this is done for Lockhart-Gardner,

604
00:31:33,291 --> 00:31:35,953
then why did LeMond Bishop
pay Kalinda directly?

605
00:31:36,127 --> 00:31:38,493
- An accounting error. Mr. Bishop...
- Come on.

606
00:31:38,663 --> 00:31:39,891
ALICIA:
Mr. Bishop's business manager

607
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:43,500
incorrectly cut the checks
to Ms. Sharma directly.

608
00:31:43,668 --> 00:31:46,136
Having done so, the firm
didn't wanna double-bill their client,

609
00:31:46,304 --> 00:31:47,737
so they let it stand.

610
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:51,364
You do realize I don't believe
a word of this, don't you?

611
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:54,868
Whatever.

612
00:31:55,046 --> 00:31:57,708
You tell Kalinda this isn't over.

613
00:32:01,286 --> 00:32:04,687
I think what we should do
is push Diane out also. Hmm?

614
00:32:04,856 --> 00:32:09,156
I mean, the question is value added.
Who adds, who doesn't, right?

615
00:32:09,327 --> 00:32:11,227
- Yeah, yeah, you're right.

ELl: Excuse me, Howard,

618
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:17,329
- Gotta make a call.
- We should move before the summer.

619
00:32:17,502 --> 00:32:20,665
Summer is when things slow down,
you know?

620
00:32:20,838 --> 00:32:23,864
I don't know, Howard.
I really don't know.

Please just forget I said anything.

Can we just go back
to us not talking? Please.

Excuse me. You, uh, Mara Stokes?

624
00:32:39,657 --> 00:32:43,093
- You prosecution or defense?
- I'm sorry?

625
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:45,525
When I heard that Cuesta's head
was on the chopping block,

626
00:32:46,097 --> 00:32:49,260
I figured one of you
would come look his investigator up.

627
00:32:49,434 --> 00:32:52,961
Plus, this place doesn't get
too many customers like you.

628
00:32:53,705 --> 00:32:55,297
Then maybe you could help me.

629
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:58,738
Did Cuesta bend the rules
to get a conviction on Patrick Rooney?

630
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:01,003
Straight shooter.

631
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:04,680
- I like your MO.
- Kalinda.

632
00:33:04,849 --> 00:33:09,582
Well, Kalinda, Richard Cuesta
fancied himself a true public servant,

633
00:33:09,754 --> 00:33:12,917
and he was gonna nail Patrick Rooney,
come hell or high water.

634
00:33:13,091 --> 00:33:15,719
And did hell or high water
ever come?

635
00:33:15,893 --> 00:33:18,862
It may have. If you're like me,

636
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:21,863
you have access to the State's
Attorney evidence locker, right?

637
00:33:22,033 --> 00:33:23,591
- Yeah.
- Well, there's something

638
00:33:23,768 --> 00:33:28,137
that never quite sat right with me.

639
00:33:28,306 --> 00:33:30,274
- What is it?
- Oh, you'll find out.

640
00:33:34,746 --> 00:33:36,680
- Thanks.
- Um...

641
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:38,907
Can I offer you
a little life advice, Kalinda?

642
00:33:41,085 --> 00:33:43,815
- Sure.
- Get out while you can.

Just don't go into retail.

644
00:33:55,533 --> 00:34:00,266
Four purchases, all on Terri Rooney's
credit card the day after her death.

645
00:34:00,438 --> 00:34:03,874
And, more importantly, the day after
Patrick Rooney was in custody.

646
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:05,976
Meaning Rooney probably
wasn't the killer.

You never saw these?

648
00:34:07,412 --> 00:34:09,812
Do you have any idea how much
evidence I had to sift through?

649
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:11,573
Plus, I was carrying
a dozen other cases.

650
00:34:11,749 --> 00:34:15,583
- Your Honor, that is not an answer.
- It was 20 years ago.

651
00:34:15,753 --> 00:34:20,349
Okay? I don't remember.
I do not recall seeing this evidence.

652
00:34:20,525 --> 00:34:23,016
You used to carry a big caseload.

653
00:34:23,194 --> 00:34:25,662
Would you review every piece
of evidence on every case?

654
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:27,491
That depended on how busy I was.

655
00:34:27,665 --> 00:34:30,156
So, what would you do with
the evidence you couldn't review?

656
00:34:30,334 --> 00:34:32,131
- I'd farm it out.
- To your co-counsel?

657
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:35,438
No.

658
00:34:35,606 --> 00:34:38,439
- I have to draw a line somewhere.
- Really?

659
00:34:38,609 --> 00:34:40,133
- This is where you draw it?
CUESTA: Yes.

660
00:34:40,311 --> 00:34:42,404
You had prosecutorial blinders on.

661
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:45,071
You saw these photos
of a mutilated wife

662
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:47,080
and you wanted
to put someone away.

663
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:49,082
That made you focus
on the evidence that helped

664
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:51,244
and ignore the evidence that hurt.

665
00:34:52,156 --> 00:34:54,124
Well, then I'm guilty.

666
00:34:54,292 --> 00:34:56,692
Your Honor, if you farmed out
the review of this evidence

667
00:34:56,861 --> 00:34:59,352
to Lloyd Bullock,
and he didn't inform you of it,

668
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:02,055
then this really is his fault. Not yours.

669
00:35:08,673 --> 00:35:10,903
Do you think there's a hell?

670

No.

all after Patrick Rooney
was in custody.

I can understand missing one,
but four?

the compiling of all financial
information in this case?

735
00:38:43,187 --> 00:38:45,246
- Yes.
ALICIA: So all the credit card receipts

736
00:38:45,423 --> 00:38:47,823
would have to cross your desk first,

737

and then it would be your responsibility
to alert ASA Cuesta.

BULLOCK:
Yes. So?

742
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:05,066
In May of that year, two months
before Terri Rooney's case,

743
00:39:05,242 --> 00:39:08,006
did you register yourself
at the CLR Clinic

744
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:11,808
for an addiction to hydrocodone
you'd developed after that accident?

745
00:39:11,982 --> 00:39:13,973
Objection, Your Honor.
This credit card information,

746
00:39:14,151 --> 00:39:16,346
it really incriminates the accused,
not Mr. Bullock.

747
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,885
Except the accused
was not addicted.

748
00:39:18,055 --> 00:39:19,989
Which has nothing to do
with credit card receipts.

Receipts you didn't know existed
until brought to attention.

750
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:24,593
Yes, which you're only doing
to reassign blame.

751
00:39:24,762 --> 00:39:27,458
Excuse me? Why would we do that?

752
00:39:27,631 --> 00:39:29,861
Why would we bring evidence
that would be damaging to us?

00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,626
You were afraid
I would bring it forward.

754
00:39:31,802 --> 00:39:34,498
Oh, Your Honor, I'm not sure
whether to be flattered or outraged

755
00:39:34,672 --> 00:39:36,537
by the prosecutor's regard
for our malevolence...

00:39:45,483 --> 00:39:47,474
Mr. Bullock,

760
00:39:47,651 --> 00:39:52,850
were you addicted
to painkillers in 1992?

761
00:39:53,023 --> 00:39:55,218
Yes, Your Honor,
I had a dependency problem,

762
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:57,418
- but I never saw...
- I understand that, sir.

763
00:39:57,595 --> 00:40:00,291
Did you mention this dependency
to your co-counsel over there?

764
00:40:02,633 --> 00:40:05,033
- No.
- Okay.

765
00:40:05,202 --> 00:40:08,763
Judge Cuesta, did you ever see
any of these credit card receipts?

766
00:40:12,443 --> 00:40:14,206
