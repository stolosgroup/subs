1
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,500
Um...

2
00:00:13,437 --> 00:00:14,975
Take your time.

3
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:17,306
(phone rings)

4
00:00:17,308 --> 00:00:19,141
Do you have to get that?

5
00:00:19,784 --> 00:00:22,620
It might be my campaign office.

6
00:00:24,284 --> 00:00:25,689
Hello.

7
00:00:27,077 --> 00:00:28,544
Hello?

8
00:00:28,569 --> 00:00:30,643
Hi, Mrs. Florrick. This is Michael Browning

9
00:00:30,668 --> 00:00:33,035
from Fiscal One. How are you
doing today... pretty good?

10
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:34,326
I'm not interested, thank you.

11
00:00:34,351 --> 00:00:35,984
Do you know you might be paying more

12
00:00:36,009 --> 00:00:37,675
in monthly credit fees than you should be?

13
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,165
- Thank you. Good-bye.
- Sizable sav...

14
00:00:42,006 --> 00:00:43,640
Everything all right?

15
00:00:43,665 --> 00:00:45,898
Yes. Uh, I'm sorry, um,

16
00:00:45,923 --> 00:00:47,213
what was the question again?

17
00:00:47,238 --> 00:00:49,638
The names of some friends I can interview?

18
00:00:49,991 --> 00:00:51,925
Just to get a fuller picture?

19
00:00:55,791 --> 00:00:57,291
Can I have a think on that?

20
00:00:57,316 --> 00:01:01,285
Sure. Um, why don't we turn to...

21
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:02,974
Will Gardner?

22
00:01:02,999 --> 00:01:05,325
I think it might be a nice
place to start your memoir.

23
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:07,651
A brush with violence, you
know? And then we go back

24
00:01:07,676 --> 00:01:09,538
to when you got started in the law.

25
00:01:11,417 --> 00:01:13,861
I'm just trying to find a structure here.

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

27
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:32,465

28
00:01:34,401 --> 00:01:35,520
Hello.

29
00:01:35,545 --> 00:01:38,381
WOMAN: Hello, Mrs. Florrick,
how are you doing today?

30
00:01:38,406 --> 00:01:39,839
Thank you, I'm not interested.

31
00:01:39,841 --> 00:01:41,841
I am calling from the
Cancer Prevention League.

32
00:01:41,866 --> 00:01:43,526

I'm just calling you to
thank you for your donation.

I didn't make a donation, Alicia.

I kept leaving messages at

Brett Tatro?

Yes.

83
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:10,239
- Attempted murder.
- Yes.

84
00:04:10,264 --> 00:04:11,808
You got me off six years ago.

85
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:13,967
- I was the bouncer at the strip joint.
- Yeah.

I-I'm sorry, I-I didn't know who you were.

87
00:04:17,071 --> 00:04:19,440
Alicia, I was arrested four months ago

88
00:04:19,465 --> 00:04:21,139
on first-degree murder charges.

89
00:04:21,164 --> 00:04:22,322
Oh, my God,

90
00:04:22,347 --> 00:04:24,330
- I'm so sorry.
- Yeah, well, it's the same case,

91
00:04:24,355 --> 00:04:26,283
Alicia. It's the same case.

92
00:04:26,308 --> 00:04:27,851
What do you mean it's the same case?

93
00:04:27,876 --> 00:04:29,976
I mean the same case you got me off for...

94
00:04:30,001 --> 00:04:31,386
They're trying me again.

95
00:04:31,411 --> 00:04:33,778
They can't do that, Brett.
You were found not guilty.

96
00:04:33,803 --> 00:04:35,335
Jeff died.

97
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:39,265
The man they said that I punched
in 2009, he-he just died.

98
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:41,584
They said it doesn't
matter that you got me off

99
00:04:41,642 --> 00:04:43,742
for attempted murder.

100
00:04:43,767 --> 00:04:46,437
I can now be tried for murder.

101
00:04:47,719 --> 00:04:49,856
Alicia, I... I need your help.

102
00:04:49,881 --> 00:04:51,481
Brett, I...

103
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,828
Let me get you the name of a good lawyer.

104
00:04:54,853 --> 00:04:57,132
- No, wait, no,<i> you're</i> a good lawyer.
- No. I-I mean,

105
00:04:57,157 --> 00:04:59,424
yes, but I'm not practicing law anymore.

106
00:04:59,449 --> 00:05:01,315
Alicia, I'm going to court tomorrow.

107
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,806
Just... Just come by and observe?

108
00:05:02,831 --> 00:05:04,764
I have a good lawyer for you, Brett.

109
00:05:04,789 --> 00:05:07,824
Let me talk to him, I will call you back.

110
00:05:08,059 --> 00:05:09,660
Wow.

111
00:05:10,626 --> 00:05:12,826
(indistinct conversations)

112
00:05:26,592 --> 00:05:28,696
Are we incognito?

113
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,844
We are. Laying low. Thanks for coming.

114
00:05:31,869 --> 00:05:33,210
No problem.

115
00:05:33,408 --> 00:05:35,489
So this case... it's an old client.

116
00:05:35,514 --> 00:05:37,080
It's really unjust.

117
00:05:37,105 --> 00:05:39,032
After six years, they're
going after him for murder.

118
00:05:39,057 --> 00:05:40,976
I don't know if I can
take the work load, Alicia.

119
00:05:41,001 --> 00:05:43,935
I'm deep in two mail
fraud trials right now.

120
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,522
But you should do it.

121
00:05:45,698 --> 00:05:47,164
Oh, no. I...

122
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:48,655
I'd do more harm than good.

123
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,880
What? Why?

124
00:05:53,622 --> 00:05:56,925
Um, because I'm busy
with this memoir, and...

125
00:05:58,028 --> 00:06:02,370
- And...
- I'm... Well, I'm having...

126
00:06:02,758 --> 00:06:07,694
a crisis of confidence, and
it's taking up all my time.

127
00:06:07,789 --> 00:06:09,222
I see. So it probably wouldn't help

128
00:06:09,247 --> 00:06:11,447
to tell you to get back on the horse, then?

129
00:06:11,472 --> 00:06:13,536
It's just different when you're embarrassed

130
00:06:13,561 --> 00:06:15,761
and everyone's staring at you.

131
00:06:15,786 --> 00:06:17,163
For what?

132
00:06:18,808 --> 00:06:20,608
The election.

133
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:24,187
Well, here's the good news.

134
00:06:24,435 --> 00:06:26,135
You're not that important.

135
00:06:26,137 --> 00:06:28,671
People aren't staring at you. People

136
00:06:28,673 --> 00:06:31,160
are way too busy getting
on with their lives, okay?

137
00:06:31,609 --> 00:06:34,343
So... do it.

138
00:06:34,345 --> 00:06:35,678
Help this guy. He needs your help.

139
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,147
Stop thinking about yourself, and

140
00:06:38,149 --> 00:06:40,013
think about him.

141
00:06:41,619 --> 00:06:43,719
I can't take another failure.

142
00:06:43,721 --> 00:06:45,554
Mm.

143
00:06:45,556 --> 00:06:47,131
Oh, well, then don't fail.

144
00:06:47,266 --> 00:06:49,435
- We asked for the record...
- The defense would like...

145
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:50,793
- of the earlier trial.
- the transcripts. If I

146
00:06:50,795 --> 00:06:53,055
could finish... Your
Honor, this is a travesty.

147
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,565
The defense attorney is
arguing double jeopardy, but

148
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:57,156
Mr. Tatro is not being accused

149
00:06:57,181 --> 00:06:58,714
- of the same crime.
- Your Honor, if I could speak.

150
00:06:58,739 --> 00:07:00,806
In 2009 we needed to prove that Mr. Tatro

151
00:07:00,831 --> 00:07:03,782
had a specific intent to
kill Mr. Jeffrey Garrix.

152
00:07:03,782 --> 00:07:04,961
- And they failed. They did not...
- But now,

153
00:07:04,961 --> 00:07:07,109
the charge is first
- degree murder, and we don't

154
00:07:07,111 --> 00:07:09,591
- need to prove intent.
- This is an injustice. My father

155
00:07:09,616 --> 00:07:13,084
is a... Excuse me. My-My client is a father

156
00:07:13,109 --> 00:07:15,131
- of three. He's not a criminal.
- I can't see what that has to do

157
00:07:15,156 --> 00:07:18,855
with the charge, Your Honor.
In 2009, Mr. Tatro viciously

158
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,080
and repeatedly punched
and kicked a young man,

159
00:07:21,105 --> 00:07:23,572
- putting him into a coma.
- A coma he recovered from.

160
00:07:23,597 --> 00:07:25,356
And now that young man has died

161
00:07:25,381 --> 00:07:27,114
due to those injuries in 2009.

162
00:07:27,139 --> 00:07:29,639
Okay, thank you both.

163
00:07:29,733 --> 00:07:32,767
Is this your first
criminal trial, Ms. Audrey?

164
00:07:32,769 --> 00:07:35,470
It is, Your Honor. But
it doesn't have to be

165
00:07:35,495 --> 00:07:37,762
- if you rule against the prosecution.
- (Dunaway chuckles)

166
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,886
Unfortunately, ASA Brody
is right on the law.

167
00:07:40,911 --> 00:07:43,011
This is not double
jeopardy. So we'll commence

168
00:07:43,013 --> 00:07:44,651
pretrial motions tomorrow.

169
00:07:44,676 --> 00:07:46,009
(gavel bangs)

170
00:07:46,183 --> 00:07:49,451
Oh, Alicia. Thank you.

171
00:07:49,453 --> 00:07:51,553
I'm just here to check
it out, Brett, that's all.

172
00:07:51,555 --> 00:07:53,621
- Uh, you remember my wife Josie?
- Oh,

173
00:07:53,623 --> 00:07:55,557
yes, hi. I didn't know you got married.

174
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:56,958
Five years ago.

175
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,427
Three little girls. They're adorable.

176
00:07:59,429 --> 00:08:02,130
Wouldn't even exist if
you hadn't gotten me off.

177
00:08:02,132 --> 00:08:04,839
Can you believe I'd be halfway
through my sentence right now?

178
00:08:04,864 --> 00:08:07,813
- Six years into a 12-year sentence.
- What did you think about Amber?

179
00:08:07,838 --> 00:08:10,099
Your lawyer? Good.

180
00:08:10,124 --> 00:08:12,491
- She's a little nervous.
- She couldn't get a word in edgewise.

181
00:08:12,516 --> 00:08:14,315
Well, Matan can be rough on new lawyers.

182
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,873
He was that way with me.

183
00:08:15,898 --> 00:08:17,264
I was just as nervous.

184
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:18,855
But you won.

185
00:08:19,553 --> 00:08:20,865
MATAN: Alicia.

186
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:24,419
Excuse me for a minute.

187
00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:29,090
I didn't know you were on this, Alicia.

188
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:31,083
I'm just here observing, that's all.

189
00:08:31,108 --> 00:08:32,693
It should be more
interesting this time around.

190
00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:35,266
- Not so easy to win.
- Really? Why's that?

191
00:08:36,065 --> 00:08:37,832
There's a hole in your case.

192
00:08:38,081 --> 00:08:40,765
A hole? What hole?

193
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:42,614
(short chuckle) You know, hey,

194
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:44,538
sorry about the election.

195
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:47,642
People can be mean at first,
but they'll forget soon enough.

196
00:08:47,644 --> 00:08:49,906
A few months, it'll be
like it never happened.

197
00:08:50,213 --> 00:08:51,946
Just like Peter.

198
00:09:02,282 --> 00:09:04,892
Okay, let's get started.

(phones ring)

202
00:09:23,694 --> 00:09:27,124
Alicia? Hi, how are you?

203
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:28,330
Good,

204
00:09:28,332 --> 00:09:29,622
actually, thank you.

205
00:09:29,647 --> 00:09:31,547
Uh, this is a business call.

206
00:09:31,816 --> 00:09:33,249
What business?

207
00:09:33,274 --> 00:09:35,341
Do you remember Brett Tatro?

208
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:37,566
Attempted murder. We
fought it our first year.

209
00:09:37,591 --> 00:09:39,224
He called here a few times, but we don't

210
00:09:39,249 --> 00:09:40,782
take cases like that anymore.

211
00:09:41,804 --> 00:09:45,073
Well, I need, uh, the file on the case. Uh,

212
00:09:45,098 --> 00:09:46,771
I don't want to go through David Lee

213
00:09:46,796 --> 00:09:48,095
and deal with the usual hassle.

214
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,020
Are you representing him, Alicia?

215
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,754
I am.

216
00:09:52,756 --> 00:09:54,276
Well, that's...

217
00:09:54,301 --> 00:09:56,602
that's... that's great.

218
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:59,035
Sure, I'll get the files over. Where?

219
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,492
Oh, just to my apartment.

220
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:03,498
Oh. Right. You... Your apartment.

221
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,651
And, Cary,

222
00:10:04,676 --> 00:10:07,239
do you remember if there
was a hole in that case?

223
00:10:07,264 --> 00:10:08,597
Anything we missed in the defense?

224
00:10:08,622 --> 00:10:11,756
No, but it was a long time ago. Why?

225
00:10:11,781 --> 00:10:14,181
Matan seems to think there's
a hole he can exploit.

226
00:10:14,181 --> 00:10:17,011
Well, my guess is you'll
find it in the files.

227
00:10:17,013 --> 00:10:18,722
We were completists back then.

228
00:10:18,747 --> 00:10:20,330
Took notes on everything.

229
00:10:20,937 --> 00:10:22,390
Thanks.

00:11:20,242 --> 00:11:22,009
I just don't want to miss anything.

244
00:11:22,011 --> 00:11:23,610
BRETT: Uh, no. Sure, sure.

245
00:11:23,612 --> 00:11:25,370
So how's this work again?

246
00:11:25,407 --> 00:11:29,472
ALICIA: Well, Stern, Lockhart
& Gardner offer a certain number

247
00:11:29,497 --> 00:11:32,197
of associate hours to
pro bono cases like yours.

248
00:11:32,222 --> 00:11:34,923
- Free of charge.
- Well, I didn't do it.

249
00:11:34,948 --> 00:11:36,181
I didn't beat that guy up.

250
00:11:36,206 --> 00:11:37,921
- ALICIA: Jeff Garrix?
- BRETT: Yeah, him.

251
00:11:37,946 --> 00:11:39,545
I didn't lay a hand on him.

252
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:41,803
ALICIA: Um, where did you meet him?

253
00:11:41,828 --> 00:11:44,929
- Was it at the nightclub?
- No, it was, uh, it was earlier than that.

254
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:48,322
Dakota had a bachelor party
at the Sheraton. 12 guests.

255
00:11:48,347 --> 00:11:51,413
- ALICIA: Jeff Garrix was there?
- BRETT: Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am,

256
00:11:51,438 --> 00:11:53,840
he thought that they had paid
for topless and bottomless,

257
00:11:53,842 --> 00:11:56,443
- so I had to explain to him the rules.
- ALICIA: And he got angry?

258
00:11:56,445 --> 00:11:58,612
- Yeah. Silly college kid.
- So

259
00:11:58,614 --> 00:12:01,881
then he followed you
back to the Pink Sapphire?

260
00:12:01,883 --> 00:12:04,050
BRETT: Yeah, Dakota left
behind some business cards.

261
00:12:04,052 --> 00:12:05,986
ALICIA: And that's where
you got in the fight with him

262
00:12:05,988 --> 00:12:07,420
- in the parking lot?
- BRETT: Nah, nah,

263
00:12:07,422 --> 00:12:08,989
I wasn't in the parking lot.

264
00:12:08,991 --> 00:12:10,790
The police said they
arrested you for fighting him

265
00:12:10,792 --> 00:12:12,826
- in the parking lot.
- Yeah, I mean, I know. But like

266
00:12:12,828 --> 00:12:15,140
- I told them, I wasn't there.
- Well, where were you?

267
00:12:15,293 --> 00:12:16,909
I was with Lexie.

268
00:12:22,903 --> 00:12:26,539
ALICIA: The tape recorder is
just to aid me in my note-taking.

269
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:28,241
LEXIE: Sure. Anything you need.

270
00:12:28,243 --> 00:12:30,577
You want some water? No, thank you.

271
00:12:30,602 --> 00:12:32,702
- So, um...
- (wolf whistles)

272
00:12:32,729 --> 00:12:34,562
you were with Brett during the fight?

273
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,560
Oh, yeah. In my dressing room.

274
00:12:36,585 --> 00:12:38,483
I wasn't feeling so good that night.

275
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,352
So...

276
00:12:40,568 --> 00:12:43,366
you're that lady with the husband, right?

277
00:12:43,997 --> 00:12:45,420
ALICIA: That's kind of vague.

278
00:12:45,445 --> 00:12:47,078
LEXIE: Yeah, um, I mean

279
00:12:47,103 --> 00:12:49,537
the guy in jail. With the prostitutes.

280
00:12:49,931 --> 00:12:51,626
I am.

281
00:12:52,479 --> 00:12:54,297
I thought that was pretty cool...

282
00:12:54,322 --> 00:12:55,571
you standing by him.

283
00:12:55,596 --> 00:12:58,130
Thank you. So, anything else, Lexie?

284
00:12:58,155 --> 00:12:59,688
Anything about Brett?

285
00:12:59,713 --> 00:13:01,079
Just that he's innocent.

286
00:13:01,104 --> 00:13:03,371
- And you'll testify to that?
- Definitely.

287
00:13:03,745 --> 00:13:05,352
- It's my du...
- (click)

288
00:13:07,814 --> 00:13:10,424
ALICIA: Now, Brett, if you
weren't in the parking lot fight,

289
00:13:10,449 --> 00:13:12,482
how did you get these bruises on your face?

290
00:13:12,507 --> 00:13:13,816
All right, from-from Jeff Garrix.

291
00:13:13,841 --> 00:13:15,357
But at the Sheraton.

292
00:13:15,382 --> 00:13:18,117
We got in a fight over whether
he had just topless or not.

293
00:13:18,142 --> 00:13:19,741
DIANE: Alicia,

294
00:13:20,981 --> 00:13:22,481
do you have a moment?

295
00:13:22,506 --> 00:13:24,306
ALICIA: Yes, of course.

296
00:13:24,331 --> 00:13:26,565
Thank you, Mr... (static)

297
00:13:27,068 --> 00:13:28,457
(click)

298
00:13:29,003 --> 00:13:32,104
(phone ringing, indistinct conversations)

299
00:13:32,106 --> 00:13:33,834
DIANE: <i>You've probably noticed</i>

300
00:13:33,859 --> 00:13:36,084
<i>a lot of this firm</i>
<i>is about cooperation.</i>

301
00:13:36,109 --> 00:13:38,509
We're a family here, and
we like to work together.

302
00:13:38,534 --> 00:13:40,267
Now, I know you two are in competition,

303
00:13:40,292 --> 00:13:42,625
and competition is always a healthy thing,

304
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:46,572
but I want you to work on
this pro bono case together.

305
00:13:46,597 --> 00:13:48,531
The Brett Tatro case. I'm already

306
00:13:48,556 --> 00:13:49,988
deep into it, Ms. Lockhart.

307
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:52,157
Yes, and Cary will be your second chair.

308
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:53,788
Use him as your stalking horse.

309
00:13:53,813 --> 00:13:56,247
That's how we improve. Okay?

310
00:13:56,272 --> 00:13:58,872
Is there anything either
of you want to say?

311
00:13:59,099 --> 00:14:00,293
No.

312
00:14:00,318 --> 00:14:02,018
- All good.
- Same here.

313
00:14:04,669 --> 00:14:06,870
You take the other bouncer... Daniel.

314
00:14:09,609 --> 00:14:11,286
Yeah, I'll take Jeff Garrix, too.

315
00:14:11,311 --> 00:14:12,755
He won't talk to the defense.

316
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:16,148
He might... if it's the right defense.

317
00:14:19,318 --> 00:14:21,738
GARRIX: My lawyer told
me not to talk to you.

318
00:14:21,763 --> 00:14:24,397
Said you'd just try and
distort what I say in court.

319
00:14:24,892 --> 00:14:28,126
KALINDA: Well, do I look like
someone who would do that?

320
00:14:28,128 --> 00:14:31,101
- (Garrix chuckles)
- So, how are your legs?

321
00:14:31,126 --> 00:14:34,043
It's my spine. Your client
kicked me in the back,

322
00:14:34,068 --> 00:14:35,934
almost crippled me for life.

323
00:14:36,403 --> 00:14:37,802
What's your name?

324
00:14:37,804 --> 00:14:39,658
- Kalinda.
- Kalinda what?

325
00:14:39,683 --> 00:14:41,283
Kalinda none of your business.

326
00:14:41,575 --> 00:14:44,809
Brett Tatro said that
you also had an encounter

327
00:14:44,811 --> 00:14:46,544
at the Sheraton prior to the parking lot.

328
00:14:46,569 --> 00:14:48,256
Oh, really? How convenient for him.

329
00:14:48,281 --> 00:14:50,448
He has to explain away his bruises somehow.

330
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:53,718
So you're saying there was no
fight earlier in the evening?

331
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,687
I wasn't even in the room with him.

332
00:14:55,689 --> 00:14:57,155
It was a suite.

333
00:14:57,157 --> 00:15:00,658
Some of us were watching
football in the bedroom.

334
00:15:03,496 --> 00:15:06,097
MAN: We don't really allow
bachelor parties in here anymore.

335
00:15:06,099 --> 00:15:08,266
- It was one of the last ones.
- Because of the fight?

336
00:15:08,268 --> 00:15:10,235
And all the noise. The guests complained.

337
00:15:10,237 --> 00:15:11,899
I had to come down here and send them out,

338
00:15:11,924 --> 00:15:13,548
and told them to go to their strip joint,

339
00:15:13,573 --> 00:15:15,340
if that's really what they wanted to do.

340
00:15:15,365 --> 00:15:16,697
Where's the TV?

341
00:15:16,722 --> 00:15:18,122
We don't have one in here

342
00:15:18,147 --> 00:15:19,722
while we're switching to flat screen.

343
00:15:19,813 --> 00:15:21,212
CARY: Was there a TV in here

344
00:15:21,214 --> 00:15:22,747
on the night of the bachelor party?

345
00:15:22,749 --> 00:15:23,785
MAN: No.

346
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:25,957
Garrix couldn't have been
watching football on TV,

347
00:15:25,982 --> 00:15:27,481
because there<i> was</i> no TV.

348
00:15:27,787 --> 00:15:29,587
You're sure?

349
00:15:29,589 --> 00:15:30,704
Positive.

350
00:15:31,191 --> 00:15:32,557
Okay, good.

351
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:34,292
And get the stripper, too.

352
00:15:34,294 --> 00:15:35,751
- The one who went to the bachelor party.
- Dakota.

353
00:15:35,776 --> 00:15:38,692
Yeah. Get her to confirm
that there was no TV.

354
00:15:38,717 --> 00:15:41,156
- Good. I will.
- KALINDA: Oh, and, Alicia,

355
00:15:41,181 --> 00:15:44,436
<i>write this down... 1219 Berkoff.</i>

356
00:15:44,461 --> 00:15:46,627
ALICIA: <i>Okay, got it. What is it?</i>

357
00:15:46,652 --> 00:15:48,185
<i>It's where</i> <i>I'm
buying you drinks tonight.</i>

358
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:49,977
ALICIA (laughs): <i>You
don't have to do that.</i>

359
00:15:50,002 --> 00:15:51,214
I was just doing my job.

360
00:15:51,239 --> 00:15:54,138
KALINDA: 8:00 p.m., 1219 Berkoff.

361
00:15:58,771 --> 00:16:01,205
Let go! No!

362
00:16:02,321 --> 00:16:05,456
(both laughing)

363
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:23,741
(truck horn honking on tape)

364
00:16:23,743 --> 00:16:25,831
DAKOTA: Yeah, the bachelor

365
00:16:25,856 --> 00:16:28,290
party started out fine, but
it got kind of touch-and-go.

366
00:16:28,315 --> 00:16:29,614
And did you see the victim,

367
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:31,339
- Jeff Garrix, in the bedroom?
- Mm-hmm.

368
00:16:31,364 --> 00:16:33,179
- Was there a TV...
- Was he watching a TV there?

369
00:16:33,204 --> 00:16:34,884
No, 'cause there wasn't a TV.

370
00:16:34,909 --> 00:16:36,842
CARY: Okay, good, great. And

371
00:16:36,867 --> 00:16:38,419
when the bachelor party
followed you back here,

372
00:16:38,444 --> 00:16:39,898
there was a fight in
the parking lot, right?

373
00:16:39,923 --> 00:16:41,621
- Yeah.
- But Brett

374
00:16:41,646 --> 00:16:44,494
wasn't there 'cause he was taking
care of a sick Lexie, right?

375
00:16:46,097 --> 00:16:48,282
Well, I know that's what Brett said.

376
00:16:49,404 --> 00:16:51,539
Are you saying that's not true?

377
00:16:52,962 --> 00:16:54,677
Well, I don't want to hurt Brett.

378
00:16:54,702 --> 00:16:56,243
Let me stop you right there, Dakota.

379
00:16:56,268 --> 00:16:58,749
Alicia, why don't we just...
why don't we turn off the tape?

380
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:02,419
(tape clicks off)

381
00:17:05,227 --> 00:17:06,377
CARY: <i>Now,</i>

382
00:17:06,402 --> 00:17:09,314
I don't know what you were gonna
say, Dakota, but I want to tell you,

383
00:17:09,587 --> 00:17:11,594
Brett's whole defense is his alibi.

384
00:17:11,619 --> 00:17:13,767
You, of course, should
testify to the truth.

385
00:17:13,792 --> 00:17:15,525
Just know that if you
contradict Brett's alibi,

386
00:17:15,527 --> 00:17:16,927
it might hurt him.

387
00:17:17,493 --> 00:17:18,928
You want me to say

388
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:21,260
- Brett's telling the truth?
- No.

389
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,090
I want you to be careful

390
00:17:23,115 --> 00:17:25,448
in your understanding
of what you might say.

391
00:17:26,737 --> 00:17:28,835
ALICIA: <i>Cary, you can't do that.</i>

392
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,674
- Do what?
- Tell her to lie.

393
00:17:30,676 --> 00:17:32,142
I didn't tell her to lie.

394
00:17:32,144 --> 00:17:34,477
I told her about the consequences
of her actions, that's all.

395
00:17:34,502 --> 00:17:36,135
Oh, come on. Are you serious?

396
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,280
She was about to contradict Brett's alibi.

397
00:17:38,305 --> 00:17:39,598
We don't know that.

398
00:17:39,623 --> 00:17:41,356
This is not the way I
want to practice the law.

399
00:17:41,381 --> 00:17:43,315
Oh, what, you mean successfully?

400
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:46,207
So, what if the prosecution gets to her?

401
00:17:46,258 --> 00:17:47,488
They won't.

402
00:17:47,513 --> 00:17:49,046
We have an alibi witness.

403
00:17:49,071 --> 00:17:50,726
That's all we need.

404
00:17:52,513 --> 00:17:53,866
There's the hole.

405
00:17:56,543 --> 00:17:58,477
It's not Dakota anymore.

406
00:17:58,502 --> 00:18:01,470
- It's Dani.
- Sorry, Dani.

407
00:18:01,495 --> 00:18:04,249
- I just have a few questions.
- Not pink.

408
00:18:04,547 --> 00:18:06,382
What is she, a wedding cake?

409
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,559
- You're doing very well.
- Yeah.

410
00:18:08,584 --> 00:18:11,051
Saved up my money from
those two years dancing.

411
00:18:11,382 --> 00:18:13,977
By the way, no one here
knows that I used to do that,

412
00:18:14,002 --> 00:18:15,696
so let's keep it quiet?

413
00:18:15,721 --> 00:18:16,884
What do you need?

414
00:18:16,909 --> 00:18:18,776
You know Brett's being prosecuted again?

415
00:18:18,913 --> 00:18:20,846
I heard. I'm sorry.

416
00:18:20,871 --> 00:18:24,151
Has the prosecution approached
you about that night?

417
00:18:24,176 --> 00:18:25,942
No. Why? Will they?

418
00:18:25,967 --> 00:18:29,368
They might. They think there
was a hole in our last defense.

419
00:18:29,393 --> 00:18:31,527
And I know you had some...

420
00:18:31,552 --> 00:18:33,919
hesitation about Brett's alibi.

421
00:18:33,944 --> 00:18:35,785
You're wondering if I'll
contradict his alibi?

422
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:38,114
No, I just want to lay out the consequences

423
00:18:38,139 --> 00:18:40,707
for contradicting Brett and Lexie's alibi.

424
00:18:41,012 --> 00:18:42,826
Don't worry about it.

425
00:18:42,851 --> 00:18:46,286
I see no upside to dredging up my past

426
00:18:46,311 --> 00:18:48,678
in any shape or form.

427
00:18:48,953 --> 00:18:50,630
Give me a minute, will you?

428
00:18:50,655 --> 00:18:52,902
Of course, Dakot... Dani.

429
00:18:55,237 --> 00:18:56,921
Here's the thing.

430
00:18:57,728 --> 00:19:01,410
I may not be a problem, but
did you hear about Lexie?

431
00:19:01,435 --> 00:19:02,835
No. What?

432
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:05,098
She died... four years ago.

433
00:19:05,123 --> 00:19:07,557
Drug overdose. Really sad.

434
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:11,073
Maybe that's the hole in the defense.

435
00:19:13,363 --> 00:19:15,030
MATAN: I'll drop the
charge to second-degree.

436
00:19:15,032 --> 00:19:16,465
- That's the lowest I'll go.
- Come on.

437
00:19:16,467 --> 00:19:19,301
The victim could have died for
any one in a million reasons.

438
00:19:19,303 --> 00:19:21,797
32 years old, he dies
from a brain hemorrhage

439
00:19:21,822 --> 00:19:24,777
doctors can tie directly
to that fight in 2009.

440
00:19:24,802 --> 00:19:26,903
Matan, you lost six years ago. Get over it.

441
00:19:26,928 --> 00:19:29,629
- I have a stronger case this time.
- Because Lexie's dead?

442
00:19:31,007 --> 00:19:32,810
I don't need Lexie.

443
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:35,170
I have her testimony from 2009.

444
00:19:35,195 --> 00:19:36,795
Then reject my deal.

445
00:19:39,082 --> 00:19:40,430
What do you have, Matan?

446
00:19:40,455 --> 00:19:42,956
What I have is some advice for you.

447
00:19:42,981 --> 00:19:45,021
You go to trial, you'll lose.

448
00:19:45,389 --> 00:19:48,046
That's first-degree
murder, 20 years minimum,

449
00:19:48,071 --> 00:19:50,204
serving every single day.

450
00:19:52,628 --> 00:19:55,163
I'll see you in court.

451
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:09,431
(indistinct chatter)

452
00:20:13,274 --> 00:20:16,435
AMBER: Hi, Mrs. Florrick. I am such a fan.

453
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:17,892
I'm so glad you'll be joining me.

454
00:20:17,917 --> 00:20:19,484
Oh, thank you. I'm glad, too.

455
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:21,165
I told my mom I'd be working with you.

456
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:22,420
She wanted me to get a picture.

457
00:20:22,445 --> 00:20:25,505
Do you mind? She loved how
you stood by your husband.

458
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:27,414
She wants to meet you. (click)

459
00:20:29,306 --> 00:20:30,527
ALICIA: <i>Okay, let's</i>

460
00:20:30,552 --> 00:20:33,097
talk strategy for a minute, Brett. Amber?

461
00:20:33,122 --> 00:20:36,704
Yes. Good. Hold on. I'm just sending this.

462
00:20:37,492 --> 00:20:40,159
Okay, the whole point is
to win in pretrial motions.

463
00:20:40,184 --> 00:20:42,322
If this goes to trial,
the jury can do anything.

464
00:20:42,347 --> 00:20:43,780
Even if you are innocent,

465
00:20:43,805 --> 00:20:46,392
Judge Dunaway isn't my biggest fan.

466
00:20:46,417 --> 00:20:48,180
So I'm gonna need you, Amber,

467
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:49,843
- to take some of the motions.
- I'm ready.

468
00:20:49,868 --> 00:20:52,068
Excited really. How do
you want to attack this?

469
00:20:52,093 --> 00:20:53,655
BAILIFF: All rise. Court is now in session.

470
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,547
The Honorable Judge Dunaway presiding.

471
00:20:55,572 --> 00:20:57,435
Thank you all. You may sit.

472
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:59,727
Mr. Brody and Ms. Audrey...

473
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:02,563
Well, actually, you...
you have someone new here.

474
00:21:02,588 --> 00:21:04,355
Yes, Your Honor. Alicia Florrick,

475
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:07,147
asking leave of the court
to join as co-counsel.

476
00:21:07,172 --> 00:21:09,740
- Any objections, Mr. Brody?
- None, Your Honor.

477
00:21:09,765 --> 00:21:11,664
We do not hold the recent election scandal

478
00:21:11,689 --> 00:21:13,256
against Alicia Florrick at all.

479
00:21:13,281 --> 00:21:14,830
Of course, that's why you brought it up,

480
00:21:14,855 --> 00:21:16,387
so it won't be held against her.

481
00:21:17,186 --> 00:21:18,500
Yes, Mrs. Florrick,

482
00:21:18,525 --> 00:21:20,224
you are more than
welcome to join the party.

483
00:21:20,249 --> 00:21:21,404
Take a seat.

484
00:21:21,429 --> 00:21:23,698
Now, pretrial motions... what do you have?

485
00:21:23,723 --> 00:21:25,672
Argue for the inclusion
of the transcript now.

486
00:21:25,697 --> 00:21:27,330
Your Honor, the defense would
like the transcripts to be...

487
00:21:27,355 --> 00:21:28,912
We ask that the record of
the earlier trial be excluded

488
00:21:28,937 --> 00:21:30,837
from the records as
prejudicial, Your Honor.

489
00:21:30,862 --> 00:21:33,562
The prosecution wants to
exclude this transcript for...

490
00:21:33,587 --> 00:21:36,321
Yes, we do. The jury should have
a clean hearing of the evidence.

491
00:21:36,346 --> 00:21:37,797
- We're not arguing that.
- They should not

492
00:21:37,822 --> 00:21:39,278
be tainted by the knowledge
of an earlier trial.

493
00:21:39,303 --> 00:21:40,320
Hold on.

494
00:21:40,802 --> 00:21:42,335
Let the defense speak.

495
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,642
Thank you, Your Honor.

496
00:21:44,798 --> 00:21:47,265
I'm not... uh... (sighs)

497
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:48,856
It's okay.

498
00:21:48,881 --> 00:21:50,252
- Take a breath.
- Thank you.

499
00:21:50,665 --> 00:21:52,698
(sighs)

500
00:21:52,723 --> 00:21:55,057
The prosecution is
trying to prevent the jury

501
00:21:55,082 --> 00:21:56,916
from hearing Brett's alibi.

502
00:21:56,941 --> 00:21:58,574
One of the witnesses has died,

503
00:21:58,599 --> 00:22:00,432
and our only record of her testimony

504
00:22:00,457 --> 00:22:01,823
is in this previous trial.

505
00:22:01,848 --> 00:22:03,327
MATAN: She's exactly right, Your Honor.

506
00:22:03,352 --> 00:22:05,649
That's exactly why we want
to exclude this transcript.

507
00:22:05,674 --> 00:22:08,742
Because this witness, a
stripper named Lexie Bromwich,

508
00:22:08,767 --> 00:22:10,166
perjured herself on the stand.

509
00:22:10,191 --> 00:22:11,724
Do you have evidence to that effect?

510
00:22:11,749 --> 00:22:13,048
Why, I do.

511
00:22:13,073 --> 00:22:14,637
Thank you, Mrs. Florrick.

512
00:22:15,564 --> 00:22:17,164
Uh, Daniel Cain.

513
00:22:17,322 --> 00:22:19,789
Uh, my occupation now is...

514
00:22:19,814 --> 00:22:22,048
(laughing) not much.

515
00:22:22,073 --> 00:22:23,939
Beer drinker. (laughs)

516
00:22:23,964 --> 00:22:25,797
Um, but I used

517
00:22:25,822 --> 00:22:28,523
to work as a bouncer at the Pink Sapphire.

518
00:22:28,548 --> 00:22:30,648
You worked with the defendant Mr. Tatro?

519
00:22:30,673 --> 00:22:31,839
Yes, I did.

520
00:22:31,864 --> 00:22:32,903
Hey, Brett.

521
00:22:32,928 --> 00:22:35,384
MATAN: Do you have any
memory of Lexie Bromwich?

522
00:22:35,409 --> 00:22:36,775
Yeah, I do.

523
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,991
I went to her funeral. Poor kid.

524
00:22:40,016 --> 00:22:43,091
Do you have reason to disbelieve
her testimony from the first trial?

525
00:22:43,116 --> 00:22:45,517
Yeah. She was high.

526
00:22:45,542 --> 00:22:46,908
Objection.

527
00:22:47,288 --> 00:22:48,854
On what grounds?

528
00:22:49,111 --> 00:22:52,545
On the... give me a sec. Grounds?

529
00:22:53,714 --> 00:22:55,103
Hearsay?

530
00:22:55,851 --> 00:22:59,504
Mr. Cain, do you have firsthand knowledge

531
00:22:59,529 --> 00:23:02,753
that Lexie Bromwich was using
drugs on the day in question?

532
00:23:02,778 --> 00:23:04,244
Yes, I do.

533
00:23:04,269 --> 00:23:05,393
I saw her.

534
00:23:05,418 --> 00:23:06,522
Not only that.

535
00:23:06,547 --> 00:23:09,882
She testified for Brett
'cause he was her dealer.

536
00:23:17,384 --> 00:23:19,841
CARY: <i>So, you were a bodyguard</i>
<i>with Brett that night?</i>

537
00:23:19,866 --> 00:23:22,953
No. No, just afterwards.

538
00:23:22,978 --> 00:23:26,243
One of these college
kids came running in...

539
00:23:26,268 --> 00:23:28,594
- From the bachelor party?
- Right. Yeah.

540
00:23:28,619 --> 00:23:32,332
He came in screaming, so I went
out to see what was going on.

541
00:23:32,357 --> 00:23:33,823
It was... (distorted speech)

542
00:23:33,848 --> 00:23:35,298
DISTORTED VOICE: <i>Your mom won't... </i>

543
00:23:35,323 --> 00:23:36,968
JACKIE: <i>mind if we use this.</i>

544
00:23:36,993 --> 00:23:38,996
ZACH: I don't know. She uses it for work.

545
00:23:39,021 --> 00:23:41,146
JACKIE: Well, we have to
hear what you sound like.

546
00:23:41,171 --> 00:23:42,400
You ready?

547
00:23:42,425 --> 00:23:43,859
Now, I'm going to stand right here.

548
00:23:43,884 --> 00:23:45,751
And remember, enunciate.

549
00:23:45,776 --> 00:23:47,242
(clears throat)

550
00:23:47,267 --> 00:23:50,419
Aung San Suu was born in 1945 in Rangoon.

551
00:23:50,444 --> 00:23:53,578
- Who's that?
- That's who my speech is on.

552
00:23:53,603 --> 00:23:55,703
JACKIE: What is she, Persian?

553
00:23:56,277 --> 00:23:57,689
(click)

554
00:23:57,714 --> 00:23:59,180
Hey, Alicia. Everything all right?

555
00:23:59,205 --> 00:24:00,872
Yeah, sorry to bother you.

556
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:02,585
I've run into a problem

557
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:04,208
with some of the evidence

558
00:24:04,233 --> 00:24:07,801
that you dug up on the Brett Tatro trial.

559
00:24:09,042 --> 00:24:10,575
Cary?

560
00:24:12,011 --> 00:24:13,259
Cary?

561
00:24:13,914 --> 00:24:16,792
I'm sorry. What's the problem?

562
00:24:16,817 --> 00:24:17,933
Remember when

563
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:21,160
we co-chaired the trial, we had
an argument over trial strategy?

564
00:24:21,185 --> 00:24:22,951
- No.
- ALICIA: Yes.

565
00:24:22,976 --> 00:24:25,116
You thought that the
jury would want someone

566
00:24:25,141 --> 00:24:27,942
to blame for the beating, and
I wanted to put all the emphasis

567
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:29,248
- on the alibi.
- Right, right,

568
00:24:29,273 --> 00:24:32,038
- it was a good call. We won.
- Yes, but you were collecting evidence

569
00:24:32,063 --> 00:24:33,664
on the other bouncer Daniel.

570
00:24:33,689 --> 00:24:35,055
You wanted to blame him.

571
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,053
Do you have the files on that?

572
00:24:37,078 --> 00:24:38,511
Check the files I sent you.

573
00:24:38,536 --> 00:24:40,110
The interview with
Daniel should be in there.

574
00:24:40,135 --> 00:24:42,502
Yeah, someone recorded over it.

575
00:24:42,876 --> 00:24:44,368
Let me see what I have.

576
00:24:58,507 --> 00:25:00,664
ZACH: At this moment, Aung San Suu Kyi

577
00:25:00,689 --> 00:25:02,456
is still under house arrest.

578
00:25:02,481 --> 00:25:04,054
(clapping on tape)

579
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:05,678
That was very good.

580
00:25:05,703 --> 00:25:08,070
You have a very good speaking voice.

581
00:25:08,095 --> 00:25:09,236
Thanks, Grandma.

582
00:25:09,261 --> 00:25:10,794
What was her name again?

583
00:25:10,819 --> 00:25:12,952
- Aung San Suu Kyi.
- Oh.

584
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:15,628
You know, your dad was
interested in people like that.

585
00:25:15,653 --> 00:25:17,443
Arabs and Russians

586
00:25:17,468 --> 00:25:18,815
and things like that.

587
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,973
Like who? Can you remember who?

588
00:25:20,998 --> 00:25:23,265
Some Russian guy. Um,

589
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:24,990
- Vackel?
- Vaclav Havel?

590
00:25:25,015 --> 00:25:26,748
Yes.

591
00:25:26,773 --> 00:25:29,509
When he was your age,
he wanted to be like him.

592
00:25:29,534 --> 00:25:31,624
Why? Can you remember why?

593
00:25:31,649 --> 00:25:33,349
Oh, you know, justice.

594
00:25:33,374 --> 00:25:34,958
Things like that.

595
00:25:36,078 --> 00:25:37,865
You're a lot like your dad.

596
00:25:38,031 --> 00:25:40,065
He wants to make things better for people.

597
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:41,623
ZACH: I know.

598
00:25:41,934 --> 00:25:43,283
Give me a hug.

599
00:25:46,037 --> 00:25:48,095
He loves you, you know.

600
00:25:48,307 --> 00:25:49,669
I know.

601
00:25:50,888 --> 00:25:52,655
You're a good boy.

602
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:57,349
You're gonna change the
world just like your dad.

603
00:26:02,816 --> 00:26:05,284
(phone beeps on, line ringing)

604
00:26:05,309 --> 00:26:06,975
You've reached Zach's voice mail.

605
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,850
I'm in class right now or sleeping it off.

606
00:26:08,875 --> 00:26:10,374
(beep)

607
00:26:10,399 --> 00:26:14,134
Zach. Hi. It's Mom.

608
00:26:14,516 --> 00:26:15,992
We haven't talked in a while.

609
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:18,823
(phone beeps off)

610
00:26:18,848 --> 00:26:20,781
(doorbell rings)

611
00:26:23,029 --> 00:26:25,631
Cary. You could have sent someone.

612
00:26:25,656 --> 00:26:27,155
Yes, I could have.

613
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:29,170
ALICIA: <i>You had all this stuff,</i>

614
00:26:29,195 --> 00:26:30,693
<i>and you never showed it to me?</i>

615
00:26:30,718 --> 00:26:32,047
I did try to show you,

616
00:26:32,072 --> 00:26:33,631
but you wanted to take the
case in another direction.

617
00:26:33,656 --> 00:26:36,481
- (laughs) You didn't try to show me.
- I did.

618
00:26:36,506 --> 00:26:38,405
You always thought I was more competitive

619
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,731
- than I really was.
- You were competitive.

620
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:42,422
Yeah, I was.

621
00:26:42,447 --> 00:26:44,014
(laughs)

622
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:48,756
Wow. It's a lot of work.

623
00:26:48,781 --> 00:26:50,180
Oh, not really.

624
00:26:50,205 --> 00:26:52,741
- So, how's it going?
- I don't know.

625
00:26:53,238 --> 00:26:55,292
They're trying to throw out the alibi.

626
00:26:55,942 --> 00:26:57,575
You know what?

627
00:26:57,976 --> 00:27:00,299
We're better lawyers now.

628
00:27:00,324 --> 00:27:02,158
Makes sense. We were young.

629
00:27:02,183 --> 00:27:04,628
Yeah, but there's still
something I miss about it.

630
00:27:04,995 --> 00:27:05,995
What?

631
00:27:06,451 --> 00:27:11,187
Looking at the law as something good.

632
00:27:13,227 --> 00:27:14,963
Do you think it's not good?

633
00:27:15,382 --> 00:27:18,450
No, I think it's... neutral.

634
00:27:22,066 --> 00:27:24,634
Kalinda's gone.

635
00:27:26,423 --> 00:27:28,371
I know.

636
00:27:29,301 --> 00:27:30,900
Did you see her?

637
00:27:33,877 --> 00:27:36,078
No. Did you?

638
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:41,000
She's not really one for good-byes.

639
00:27:41,967 --> 00:27:43,531
I know.

640
00:27:44,889 --> 00:27:46,682
I'm sorry.

641
00:27:47,509 --> 00:27:49,269
Me, too.

642
00:27:52,487 --> 00:27:56,790
Well... hope you get to use
this stuff against Daniel.

643
00:27:56,815 --> 00:27:58,176
It's like a director's cut.

644
00:27:58,201 --> 00:28:00,343
Wouldn't mind finally seeing it shown.

645
00:28:01,291 --> 00:28:03,129
Then let's show it.

646
00:28:05,023 --> 00:28:08,452
ALICIA: Mr. Cain, in a news
report from 2009, you claimed

647
00:28:08,477 --> 00:28:10,956
you were never in the parking
lot where the fight took place.

648
00:28:10,981 --> 00:28:13,148
- Is that still true?
- Uh-huh.

649
00:28:13,288 --> 00:28:15,495
"Uh-huh," uh, meaning "yes"?

650
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,560
Yes.

651
00:28:16,585 --> 00:28:18,678
- Correct. Affirmative. (laughs)
- And yet,

652
00:28:18,703 --> 00:28:20,258
in this crime scene photo,

653
00:28:20,283 --> 00:28:21,749
the front of your clothes seem

654
00:28:21,774 --> 00:28:23,353
to be covered in blood.

655
00:28:23,378 --> 00:28:25,570
- So?
- So, how did the blood get there?

656
00:28:25,595 --> 00:28:27,479
I cradled his head in my lap.

657
00:28:27,504 --> 00:28:31,367
- After you hit him?
- No. No, after Brett hit him, or someone.

658
00:28:31,392 --> 00:28:33,559
So, you were in the parking lot?

659
00:28:33,584 --> 00:28:34,917
Afterward.

660
00:28:34,942 --> 00:28:37,075
- After the fight.
- Okay.

661
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:41,499
Did you make a 911 call after the fight?

662
00:28:41,524 --> 00:28:43,215
- Did I? No.
- Did you have possession

663
00:28:43,215 --> 00:28:44,374
of your cell phone?

664
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:46,114
I did. Why?

665
00:28:46,139 --> 00:28:49,440
Oh, there's a record of a
911 call from your cell phone,

666
00:28:49,465 --> 00:28:51,799
but the call was terminated
before you said anything.

667
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:56,117
DUNAWAY: Would you like to
revise your testimony, Mr. Cain?

668
00:28:57,261 --> 00:28:59,446
I... guess I called,

669
00:28:59,525 --> 00:29:01,551
but the guy was bleeding,

670
00:29:01,576 --> 00:29:04,048
and I saw a lot of other people calling.

671
00:29:04,483 --> 00:29:05,949
I... I'm not lying.

672
00:29:08,004 --> 00:29:09,650
ALICIA: So it's not a strip club anymore.

673
00:29:09,675 --> 00:29:12,089
- No, it's a charter school.
- Okay.

674
00:29:12,114 --> 00:29:13,513
I need you to get the names

675
00:29:13,538 --> 00:29:15,138
of the people you worked with here,

676
00:29:15,163 --> 00:29:16,596
a-anyone you can remember.

677
00:29:16,621 --> 00:29:18,198
- Why?
- Well, we need another way

678
00:29:18,223 --> 00:29:20,857
to establish your alibi in
case the judge rules against us.

679
00:29:20,882 --> 00:29:24,498
Just anyone you can think of,
and we'll try and locate them.

680
00:29:25,073 --> 00:29:26,839
What's wrong, Brett? What's going on?

681
00:29:29,091 --> 00:29:30,892
Tell them.

682
00:29:31,717 --> 00:29:33,728
BRETT: <i>Just so you know,</i>

683
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:36,382
I'm innocent. I did not touch
that kid in that parking lot.

684
00:29:36,456 --> 00:29:37,755
But?

685
00:29:38,617 --> 00:29:40,843
But I was in the parking lot.

686
00:29:40,868 --> 00:29:43,269
But I-I didn't do this, Alicia. I didn't.

687
00:29:43,294 --> 00:29:45,927
I was headed back to the car
to get something for Dakota.

688
00:29:45,952 --> 00:29:47,986
- That's all.
- To get what?

689
00:29:49,044 --> 00:29:50,795
To get what?

690
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,286
You were her dealer?

691
00:29:52,782 --> 00:29:54,951
I was a different person.

692
00:29:54,976 --> 00:29:56,394
I've changed.

693
00:29:57,287 --> 00:29:59,519
So you got Dakota to lie for you?

694
00:29:59,544 --> 00:30:01,877
You need to help me. Please.

695
00:30:01,902 --> 00:30:03,745
Please. I'm innocent.

696
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,047
- But we know it's perjury now.
- Shh.

697
00:30:13,072 --> 00:30:14,586
We know that the alibi is false.

698
00:30:16,946 --> 00:30:19,020
We know that Brett was in that parking lot.

699
00:30:19,045 --> 00:30:20,745
- He told us so.
- Yes, but we're not putting him

700
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:22,814
on the stand, so we're
not suborning perjury.

701
00:30:22,814 --> 00:30:23,814
Yes.

702
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:27,040
Okay, but we are allowing
Dakota's testimony

703
00:30:27,065 --> 00:30:30,281
to be entered into the record,
a testimony we know is false.

704
00:30:30,306 --> 00:30:33,140
- We have to tell the judge.
- No. Listen, Amber.

705
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:36,048
When we argued for the
transcript to be admitted,

706
00:30:36,073 --> 00:30:37,939
we didn't know it was false.

707
00:30:37,964 --> 00:30:39,450
Yes, but we do now.

708
00:30:39,475 --> 00:30:40,922
Right, but that doesn't matter.

709
00:30:40,947 --> 00:30:44,682
When we argued for it
yesterday, we didn't know.

710
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:48,204
That doesn't seem right.

711
00:30:48,206 --> 00:30:50,339
I know. But it's legal.

712
00:30:51,174 --> 00:30:54,143
I think I have a lot to learn.

713
00:30:54,145 --> 00:30:55,768
SHERIFF: All rise.

714
00:30:56,481 --> 00:30:59,472
DUNAWAY: Thank you. Please be seated.

715
00:31:00,617 --> 00:31:02,529
I'm allowing the whole

716
00:31:02,554 --> 00:31:05,056
- 2009 transcript into evidence...
- Your Honor.

717
00:31:05,081 --> 00:31:07,478
Matan, you are welcome to
call your witness to testify

718
00:31:07,503 --> 00:31:09,838
if we do go to trial, and, Mrs.
Florrick, you're welcome to impeach

719
00:31:09,863 --> 00:31:12,084
- him, just like you both did here.
- Your Honor,

720
00:31:12,109 --> 00:31:14,176
you mention "if we do go to trial."

721
00:31:14,201 --> 00:31:16,868
Will you rule on our motion
to dismiss? Our client

722
00:31:16,893 --> 00:31:19,801
- was already found not guilty...
- We have one more witness, Your Honor.

723
00:31:20,991 --> 00:31:23,007
Evan Houston. Do you want to know

724
00:31:23,032 --> 00:31:24,678
what I do now or what I did then?

725
00:31:24,703 --> 00:31:27,503
- MATAN: Let's try then.
- Well, I worked in a gas station

726
00:31:27,528 --> 00:31:30,455
across the street from the strip
joint, the, um, Pink Sapphire.

727
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,054
(whispering) Was he in the previous trial?

728
00:31:32,079 --> 00:31:34,244
- No. Someone new.
- And did you see that man

729
00:31:34,269 --> 00:31:35,768
over there on the night in question?

730
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:38,588
Yeah. He was in the parking lot.

731
00:31:38,613 --> 00:31:40,900
- He was beating some kid up.
- Thank you, sir.

732
00:31:40,925 --> 00:31:42,595
Mr. Houston, this is your first time

733
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:44,267
testifying against my client.

734
00:31:44,292 --> 00:31:46,093
Why didn't you come forward six years ago?

735
00:31:46,118 --> 00:31:47,716
I did come forward six years ago.

736
00:31:47,741 --> 00:31:49,941
I told the police the exact
same thing I'm telling you.

737
00:31:49,966 --> 00:31:52,467
- What police?
- A detective named Hardy.

738
00:31:52,682 --> 00:31:55,746
ALICIA: You did? Were
you too sick to testify?

739
00:31:55,771 --> 00:31:58,009
- Were you out of town, sir?
- No, I was here.

740
00:31:58,034 --> 00:32:00,177
But the prosecution
didn't want you to testify?

741
00:32:00,202 --> 00:32:02,769
- Objection. Argumentative.
- Let it go, Matan. You may answer.

742
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:06,056
- They said they didn't need me.
- How did you...

743
00:32:06,081 --> 00:32:07,447
I.D.

744
00:32:07,472 --> 00:32:09,200
my client, Mr. Houston?

745
00:32:09,225 --> 00:32:10,491
In a lineup.

746
00:32:12,493 --> 00:32:14,598
I wasn't aware my client was in

747
00:32:14,623 --> 00:32:15,981
a lineup.

748
00:32:16,006 --> 00:32:17,639
A photo lineup.

749
00:32:20,696 --> 00:32:23,365
(indistinct chatter)

750
00:32:23,367 --> 00:32:25,253
You looked good in there, I thought.

751
00:32:25,545 --> 00:32:27,120
No. We're losing.

752
00:32:27,795 --> 00:32:30,061
The judge is gonna allow
this to go to trial.

753
00:32:30,086 --> 00:32:31,552
I saw him with this new witness.

754
00:32:31,577 --> 00:32:32,774
He seemed convinced.

755
00:32:35,789 --> 00:32:38,090
You know, when I was an A.S.A.,

756
00:32:38,138 --> 00:32:40,115
I was told to double-check

757
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:42,874
cases coming through a
certain detective's hands.

758
00:32:44,305 --> 00:32:45,880
Why is that?

759
00:32:45,905 --> 00:32:47,579
'Cause he was old-school.

760
00:32:47,649 --> 00:32:49,683
If he didn't get photo
array results he liked,

761
00:32:49,708 --> 00:32:53,009
he'd reshuffle the mug shots and
ask the eyewitness to try again.

762
00:32:53,034 --> 00:32:57,036
Or he'd place a finger
on the suspect's photo.

763
00:32:57,734 --> 00:33:00,668
How do you know that?

764
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:06,309
There was an I.A.D. investigation.

765
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:10,745
Inconclusive. They dropped
it about a year ago.

766
00:33:12,576 --> 00:33:14,744
Who was the detective?

767
00:33:15,051 --> 00:33:17,418
Hardy.

768
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:19,487
(chuckles)

769
00:33:19,489 --> 00:33:23,145
That's why Matan didn't put
Evan on the stand in 2009.

770
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:25,970
He was worried about the photo array.

771
00:33:26,729 --> 00:33:28,833
That would be my guess.

772
00:33:30,266 --> 00:33:32,133
Thank you.

773
00:33:32,907 --> 00:33:35,042
I didn't say anything.

774
00:33:37,167 --> 00:33:39,095
ALICIA: Thank you for
coming in, Detective Hardy.

775
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,738
No problem. It's my job.

776
00:33:40,738 --> 00:33:42,493
In what way did the eyewitness,

777
00:33:42,518 --> 00:33:44,799
Evan Houston, I.D. my client?

778
00:33:44,824 --> 00:33:47,256
Was it by lineup or photo array?

779
00:33:47,281 --> 00:33:49,662
- HARDY: Photo array.
- And did he identify him right away?

780
00:33:49,687 --> 00:33:50,724
HARDY: Yes.

781
00:33:50,749 --> 00:33:52,829
You didn't need to take him
through the photos a second time

782
00:33:52,854 --> 00:33:54,367
because he was prone to misidentify?

783
00:33:54,367 --> 00:33:56,097
Objection. Asked and answered.

784
00:33:56,936 --> 00:33:59,281
And yet I'd like to hear
the answer a second time.

785
00:33:59,306 --> 00:34:00,605
- Detective?
- No,

786
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:02,366
I did not take him through a second time.

787
00:34:02,391 --> 00:34:04,056
Isn't there a slang for
this in the department,

788
00:34:04,081 --> 00:34:07,032
the act of running a photo array
past the witness a second time?

789
00:34:07,057 --> 00:34:09,418
Yeah, might be. I-I don't know it.

790
00:34:09,443 --> 00:34:13,312
- P.O.E. Process Of Elimination.
- Fascinating.

791
00:34:13,943 --> 00:34:17,425
Detective, wasn't there an
Internal Affairs investigation

792
00:34:17,450 --> 00:34:19,953
- into your use of these photo arrays...
- Objection!

793
00:34:19,978 --> 00:34:21,839
Uh, I haven't even gotten
the question out yet,

794
00:34:21,864 --> 00:34:23,363
- Your Honor.
- This is disgusting.

795
00:34:23,388 --> 00:34:25,598
- I.A.D. investigations are confidential.
- Yes,

796
00:34:25,623 --> 00:34:27,423
but I'm asking the detective about

797
00:34:27,448 --> 00:34:29,528
a specific practice that
has a crucial bearing

798
00:34:29,553 --> 00:34:32,020
on this case, his use of photo arrays.

799
00:34:32,045 --> 00:34:34,879
- Then ask him the question. Don't...
- I am asking him the question.

800
00:34:34,904 --> 00:34:38,906
Did I.A.D. ever investigate
you for faulty photo arrays,

801
00:34:38,931 --> 00:34:40,631
and is that the only reason why

802
00:34:40,656 --> 00:34:43,089
Evan Houston was not
included in the first trial?

803
00:34:43,114 --> 00:34:44,570
- Excuse me, Your Honor, I want a ruling.
- Was because

804
00:34:44,595 --> 00:34:46,225
Evan Houston only selected

805
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,770
my client's photo after
being shown his photo

806
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:51,396
- in two separate photo arrays.
- Objection! Object-Objection!

807
00:34:51,421 --> 00:34:55,156
All right. Thank you. Why
don't we all calm down now?

808
00:34:55,181 --> 00:34:57,179
Mrs. Florrick, you got out your question,

809
00:34:57,204 --> 00:34:58,537
which is what you wanted.

810
00:34:58,562 --> 00:35:00,305
Matan, you registered your disgust,

811
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:03,246
which is what you wanted. Why
don't you all come up here now?

812
00:35:09,051 --> 00:35:10,952
Where did you hear of
this I.A.D. report, ma'am?

813
00:35:10,977 --> 00:35:12,656
Your Honor, if there's no public knowledge

814
00:35:12,681 --> 00:35:15,248
of an I.A.D investigation, that
means the officer was cleared.

815
00:35:15,273 --> 00:35:17,207
- Or there was lack of evidence.
- But that's the whole point.

816
00:35:17,232 --> 00:35:19,002
- Obviously, there was some sort of...
- We don't know.

817
00:35:19,027 --> 00:35:21,460
Thank you, Matan. You might be right,

818
00:35:21,485 --> 00:35:23,804
but I don't know how much
I trust your detective.

819
00:35:23,804 --> 00:35:25,135
Your Honor, that is unfair.

820
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,907
- It's based on rumor-mongering.
- Yes,

821
00:35:26,932 --> 00:35:29,869
and that is why I'm asking Mrs.
Florrick how she knows this.

822
00:35:29,894 --> 00:35:31,956
The way she's always known
it, through her husband

823
00:35:31,981 --> 00:35:35,146
- or her law partner, Cary Agos.
- How do you know about the I.A.D. report,

824
00:35:35,171 --> 00:35:37,242
- Mrs. Florrick?
- And if one of them did slip this to her,

825
00:35:37,267 --> 00:35:38,772
they're in trouble,
because this work product

826
00:35:38,797 --> 00:35:40,527
is confidential. They could be disbarred

827
00:35:40,552 --> 00:35:42,509
- or be imprisoned.
- Matan, stop.

828
00:35:43,608 --> 00:35:45,975
Mrs. Florrick, it's a simple question.

829
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,368
How do you know about the I.A.D. report?

830
00:35:49,393 --> 00:35:51,594
I can't say, Your Honor.

831
00:35:51,824 --> 00:35:53,890
Why can't you say?

832
00:35:53,915 --> 00:35:55,715
Because I am bound.

833
00:35:56,077 --> 00:35:57,683
Well, that is unfortunate

834
00:35:57,708 --> 00:35:59,675
because you're gonna have to
unbound yourself pretty quick,

835
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,733
or you'll be found in contempt. Sheriff.

836
00:36:02,383 --> 00:36:05,060
I would like to consult with counsel,

837
00:36:05,085 --> 00:36:06,460
Your Honor.

838
00:36:07,168 --> 00:36:09,168
You don't want to test me, Mrs. Florrick.

839
00:36:09,193 --> 00:36:11,160
I'm not testing you, Your Honor.

840
00:36:12,142 --> 00:36:14,695
You take the night to consult with counsel.

841
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,661
And come in tomorrow prepared to answer.

842
00:36:16,686 --> 00:36:17,952
(gavel bangs)

843
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,740
(door opens)

844
00:36:29,412 --> 00:36:31,846
Mr. Kingsley-Weaver. I'm so sorry.

845
00:36:31,848 --> 00:36:33,146
Did we have a meeting today?

846
00:36:33,171 --> 00:36:35,171
I thought we did, unless we got

847
00:36:35,196 --> 00:36:38,823
- our wires crossed.
- No. Um, I've been... distracted.

848
00:36:38,848 --> 00:36:40,181
Your daughter let me in.

849
00:36:40,206 --> 00:36:41,872
- She's very sweet.
- Thank you.

850
00:36:41,897 --> 00:36:43,730
She showed me your pictures in there.

851
00:36:43,755 --> 00:36:45,365
All the murder photos.

852
00:36:45,874 --> 00:36:49,008
It's quite grisly. Can
you tell me about it?

853
00:36:49,033 --> 00:36:50,833
It might help me with the structure.

854
00:36:50,858 --> 00:36:53,240
I... Mm.

855
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:24,665
ALICIA: <i>But it's wrong, isn't it?</i>

856
00:37:24,667 --> 00:37:27,189
Cary basically told the witness to lie.

857
00:37:27,214 --> 00:37:28,847
She was gonna contradict Brett's alibi.

858
00:37:28,872 --> 00:37:30,282
Did you tell her to lie?

859
00:37:30,307 --> 00:37:33,126
- No, but...
- Do you believe in the client?

860
00:37:33,476 --> 00:37:34,791
What do you mean?

861
00:37:34,816 --> 00:37:37,384
Well, do you think that your
client's telling the truth?

862
00:37:37,409 --> 00:37:39,506
I don't know if he's
telling the full truth.

863
00:37:39,531 --> 00:37:41,449
Nobody ever tells the full truth.

864
00:37:41,474 --> 00:37:43,957
- Ever.
- God, you're such a cynic.

865
00:37:43,982 --> 00:37:46,618
No, just... experienced.

866
00:37:47,623 --> 00:37:48,907
Look, Alicia,

867
00:37:48,932 --> 00:37:51,374
do you think that your
client beat this guy up?

868
00:37:51,374 --> 00:37:52,374
No.

869
00:37:53,233 --> 00:37:57,135
Then it's all right for you
to do everything within the law

870
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,177
to defend him.

871
00:37:58,202 --> 00:38:00,235
Not even all right. It's your duty.

872
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:01,760
But is it all right to lie?

873
00:38:01,785 --> 00:38:04,052
(chuckles) Not under oath.

874
00:38:05,621 --> 00:38:07,197
Okay.

875
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:09,397
Here's to experience.

876
00:38:09,422 --> 00:38:10,754
Experience.

877
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:17,451
(knocking)

878
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:19,186
Hey.

879
00:38:19,211 --> 00:38:21,378
Hey. Sorry about the mess
I left in the dining room.

880
00:38:21,403 --> 00:38:22,449
That's okay.

881
00:38:22,474 --> 00:38:24,474
- You on a case?
- I am.

882
00:38:24,499 --> 00:38:27,333
That's good. You're happier
when you're on a case.

883
00:38:27,358 --> 00:38:28,477
Really?

884
00:38:28,477 --> 00:38:31,152
Yeah, I worry about you
when you just sit at home.

885
00:38:31,177 --> 00:38:33,811
(chuckles softly)

886
00:38:35,737 --> 00:38:38,377
I'm thinking about starting my own firm.

887
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:40,577
What do you think about that?

888
00:38:40,602 --> 00:38:42,535
But you already started one, didn't you?

889
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,660
Yeah, but this would be different.

890
00:38:44,685 --> 00:38:47,152
It would be to help
people I wanted to help.

891
00:38:47,616 --> 00:38:49,269
Can you make money doing that?

892
00:38:49,294 --> 00:38:52,662
(chuckles) I don't know.

893
00:38:53,322 --> 00:38:54,888
I guess we'll have to see.

894
00:38:54,913 --> 00:38:56,546
I'd have to work out of the apartment.

895
00:38:56,571 --> 00:38:57,662
In the dining room?

896
00:38:57,687 --> 00:38:58,953
No.

897
00:38:59,284 --> 00:39:01,885
I don't know.

898
00:39:06,167 --> 00:39:09,669
♪ ♪

899
00:39:21,315 --> 00:39:23,850
Turn it on its side.

900
00:39:31,321 --> 00:39:34,357
Nice. Okay. You ready?

901
00:39:34,382 --> 00:39:37,316
- One, two, three.
- Three.

902
00:39:44,304 --> 00:39:47,006
Okay.

903
00:39:54,248 --> 00:39:55,455
Not bad, Mom.

904
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,246
Yep. Back to basics.

905
00:39:57,271 --> 00:39:59,238
Hey, I could be your secretary.

906
00:39:59,263 --> 00:40:01,557
- (chuckles)
- No, I could answer your phone calls,

907
00:40:01,582 --> 00:40:03,408
- get you coffee.
- Graduate from school.

908
00:40:03,433 --> 00:40:05,381
No, I have to have an internship.

909
00:40:05,406 --> 00:40:07,406
- This can be it.
- Yeah.

910
00:40:07,562 --> 00:40:10,063
- (phone rings)
- We'll see.

911
00:40:10,088 --> 00:40:11,938
Hello.

912
00:40:13,264 --> 00:40:16,365
Hello. Look, if this is sales,

913
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:18,490
you'd better hang up now
or I will rip you a new one.

914
00:40:18,515 --> 00:40:20,389
I'm a lawyer, and that'll be my first case.

915
00:40:20,389 --> 00:40:21,389
Go, Mom.

916
00:40:21,414 --> 00:40:24,481
- ZACH: Hello, Mom. It's me.
- Zach.

917
00:40:24,506 --> 00:40:27,174
- Hi. How are you?
- Good.

918
00:40:27,199 --> 00:40:29,421
I got your call. Is everything okay?

919
00:40:29,446 --> 00:40:32,281
Yes. Great, in fact. Really great.

920
00:40:32,306 --> 00:40:34,839
Good. I was thinking of
coming home tomorrow night.

921
00:40:35,656 --> 00:40:37,715
Oh.

922
00:40:42,243 --> 00:40:43,677
(indistinct chatter)

923
00:40:43,702 --> 00:40:45,502
Do you know what you're gonna do?

924
00:40:45,527 --> 00:40:47,093
Maybe.

925
00:40:47,118 --> 00:40:50,786
If he jails me, I need
you to call Cary Agos.

926
00:40:50,811 --> 00:40:53,078
Sure. Do you think it'll come to that?

927
00:40:53,103 --> 00:40:55,070
- No idea.
- SHERIFF: All rise.

928
00:40:55,996 --> 00:40:57,726
Mrs. Florrick. Mr. Brody.

929
00:40:57,751 --> 00:40:58,926
Up here.

930
00:41:00,024 --> 00:41:02,836
(clears throat) Well, okay, Mrs. Florrick,

931
00:41:02,861 --> 00:41:04,237
have you consulted with counsel?

932
00:41:04,262 --> 00:41:05,957
- I have, Your Honor.
- Are you ready to tell us

933
00:41:05,982 --> 00:41:08,957
who informed you about
this I.A.D. investigation?

934
00:41:09,056 --> 00:41:10,690
Well, first of all, Your...

935
00:41:10,715 --> 00:41:12,982
No "first of all." Tell me now or be held

936
00:41:13,007 --> 00:41:14,673
- in contempt.
- Someone tried to help me, Your Honor.

937
00:41:14,698 --> 00:41:16,505
Someone who knew that
Detective Hardy was...

938
00:41:16,530 --> 00:41:18,774
- Your Honor, this is outrageous.
- Yes, it is. Mrs. Florrick,

939
00:41:18,799 --> 00:41:20,766
- answer the question.
- I will tell you

940
00:41:20,791 --> 00:41:24,125
who informed me of the
I.A.D. investigation,

941
00:41:24,191 --> 00:41:27,192
but I want to explain
to you why they did it.

942
00:41:27,217 --> 00:41:30,285
Because justice matters to them.

943
00:41:30,310 --> 00:41:33,444
They saw an injustice at
the heart of this case,

944
00:41:33,947 --> 00:41:35,783
and I think you've seen it, too,

945
00:41:35,808 --> 00:41:37,741
- Your Honor.
- Mrs. Florrick,

946
00:41:37,899 --> 00:41:39,666
who told you?

947
00:41:40,254 --> 00:41:42,174
Kalinda Sharma.

948
00:41:42,199 --> 00:41:44,217
Oh, come on.

949
00:41:44,242 --> 00:41:46,809
This is B.S., Your Honor.
Mrs. Florrick is mentioning

950
00:41:46,834 --> 00:41:49,168
the only person who is no
longer in our jurisdiction.

951
00:41:49,193 --> 00:41:50,893
I answered your question, Your Honor.

952
00:41:50,918 --> 00:41:53,452
- I'm not sure what more the S.A...
- Kalinda Sharma

953
00:41:53,477 --> 00:41:55,327
fled our jurisdiction.
We cannot arrest her.

954
00:41:55,352 --> 00:41:57,100
She did not do this. It's either Cary Agos

955
00:41:57,125 --> 00:41:58,824
or her husband.

956
00:42:00,047 --> 00:42:02,260
I answered your question, Your Honor.

957
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,215
Yes, you did.

958
00:42:05,572 --> 00:42:07,238
Thank you, Mrs. Florrick.

959
00:42:07,754 --> 00:42:09,355
On the record.

960
00:42:10,099 --> 00:42:12,853
As to your motion to
dismiss, I will sustain that.

961
00:42:12,878 --> 00:42:14,669
- Your Honor...
- No, Matan.

962
00:42:14,694 --> 00:42:17,762
You had your shot in 2009. Let it go.

963
00:42:17,787 --> 00:42:19,382
Mr. Tatro,

964
00:42:19,407 --> 00:42:22,367
your case has been
dismissed with prejudice.

965
00:42:22,392 --> 00:42:23,916
(gavel bangs)

966
00:42:24,863 --> 00:42:26,796
Thank you. Thank you.

967
00:42:26,821 --> 00:42:28,901
I'm so gthis worked out, Brett.

968
00:42:30,937 --> 00:42:32,374
I want to learn from you.

969
00:42:32,399 --> 00:42:35,016
(chuckles) No, you don't.

Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
