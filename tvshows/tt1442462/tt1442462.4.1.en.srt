1
00:00:10,462 --> 00:00:12,630
The door's open.

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

3
00:00:36,669 --> 00:00:39,070
How you doing?

4
00:00:40,273 --> 00:00:42,641
It's, uh, it's dark in here.

5
00:00:42,642 --> 00:00:44,843
No.

6
00:00:44,844 --> 00:00:46,779
Now, don't be that way.

7
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,947
He misses you.

8
00:00:50,916 --> 00:00:54,084
It's not just the money.

9
00:00:54,085 --> 00:00:56,120
He wants you back.

10
00:00:56,121 --> 00:00:58,689
- Where is he?
- Home.

11
00:00:58,690 --> 00:00:59,724
He sent me here to...

12
00:00:59,725 --> 00:01:01,726
Don't, Bill.

13
00:01:01,727 --> 00:01:04,294
- It's a phone. I'm just getting you...
- You pull it out,

14
00:01:04,295 --> 00:01:06,129
and I'll shoot your hand off.

15
00:01:06,964 --> 00:01:09,566
Get down on your knees.

16
00:01:11,035 --> 00:01:13,202
And keep your hand where it is.

17
00:01:24,481 --> 00:01:26,348
Who called my work?

18
00:01:26,349 --> 00:01:28,751
Who? Y-Your lawyer called <i>us.</i>

19
00:01:30,086 --> 00:01:32,421
We returned.

20
00:01:32,422 --> 00:01:34,990
Phone, huh?

21
00:01:36,625 --> 00:01:38,927
- Who called her at home?
- Your lawyer?

22
00:01:38,928 --> 00:01:40,562
Uh, I did. Why?

23
00:01:40,563 --> 00:01:41,963
Ow!

24
00:01:43,966 --> 00:01:45,633
What was that for?!

25
00:01:47,903 --> 00:01:51,005
He'll get angry if I don't answer.

26
00:02:01,916 --> 00:02:05,218
Aah, you bitch! You stupid bitch!

27
00:02:10,891 --> 00:02:12,424
You bitch!

28
00:02:12,425 --> 00:02:13,626
Quiet, Bill.

29
00:02:18,932 --> 00:02:20,032
Go to hell.

30
00:02:20,033 --> 00:02:21,567
- Just go to hell.
- Hi, honey.

31
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:24,503
Bill's here. You want to talk to him?

32
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:28,740
Ow...!

33
00:02:28,741 --> 00:02:29,975
Just so you know,

34
00:02:29,976 --> 00:02:33,011
the money is mine... community property.

35
00:02:33,012 --> 00:02:38,316
I don't want any trouble, but I
am staying put and it's over.

36
00:02:38,317 --> 00:02:41,451
I've moved on. You should, too.

37
00:02:42,821 --> 00:02:44,588
You run again,

38
00:02:44,589 --> 00:02:46,056
he'll find you.

39
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:11,647
What's going on?

40
00:03:11,648 --> 00:03:14,550
- Nothing. I don't know.
- Is that for us?

41
00:03:14,551 --> 00:03:17,519
- What'd we do?
- Okay, uh, Zach, put your signal on.

42
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,387
Grace, turn the radio down.

43
00:03:19,388 --> 00:03:21,723
I shouldn't have fallen asleep.

44
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:31,165
- Hwy there. How's it going?
- Good.

45
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:33,133
Can I see your driver's
license, registration

46
00:03:33,134 --> 00:03:34,902
- and proof of insurance?
- Sure.

47
00:03:34,903 --> 00:03:37,171
- What'd we do wrong?
- Grace.

48
00:03:38,139 --> 00:03:39,239
Where you all headed?

49
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,508
Uh, home. Chicago. Highland Park.

50
00:03:41,509 --> 00:03:43,177
And where you coming from?

51
00:03:43,178 --> 00:03:44,343
Washington University.

52
00:03:44,344 --> 00:03:46,079
We were checking out colleges.

53
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,148
Ah. Sorry, I can't really
hear very well here.

54
00:03:49,149 --> 00:03:52,325
Could you step back with me,
I'll tell you why I stopped you?

55
00:03:52,326 --> 00:03:53,119
Sure.

56
00:03:59,392 --> 00:04:00,959
How fast were we going?

57
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,127
I don't know.

58
00:04:02,128 --> 00:04:04,496
Not that fast.

59
00:04:04,497 --> 00:04:06,832
Maybe it's Uncle Owen's car?

60
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:09,234
Maybe he has tickets or something.

61
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:12,571
Wait here.

62
00:04:12,572 --> 00:04:15,540
Tell him we just bought it.

63
00:04:19,612 --> 00:04:21,112
Everything all right, Officer?

64
00:04:21,113 --> 00:04:23,081
Yes, ma'am. Why don't
you stay right there,

65
00:04:23,082 --> 00:04:24,782
and I'll be right with you.

66
00:04:26,184 --> 00:04:28,219
So there's nothing wrong?

67
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:30,655
Thank you, son.

68
00:04:31,156 --> 00:04:33,790
As I was just telling your
son, about a half mile back

69
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:37,393
I saw him hit the brake lights when
he saw me and then speed up again.

70
00:04:37,394 --> 00:04:39,434
I thought maybe he was
having some trouble. Was he?

71
00:04:39,435 --> 00:04:40,463
Having some trouble?

72
00:04:40,464 --> 00:04:41,431
No.

73
00:04:41,432 --> 00:04:43,834
He said you were asleep, so...

74
00:04:45,003 --> 00:04:48,337
Just so you know, Officer, my
son just bought this car...

75
00:04:48,338 --> 00:04:49,939
Here's the thing.

76
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,273
Your son seemed a bit worried

77
00:04:51,274 --> 00:04:53,175
when I was talking to him just now,

78
00:04:53,176 --> 00:04:55,277
and this roadway is a major conduit

79
00:04:55,278 --> 00:04:56,946
for drugs, money, weapons...

80
00:04:56,947 --> 00:04:59,248
He's 17 years old, being
questioned by a police officer.

81
00:04:59,249 --> 00:05:01,609
- That's probably why.
- You're probably right, but, if you

82
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:03,250
don't mind, I have my
K-9 in my car here.

83
00:05:03,251 --> 00:05:04,418
I'd like to just

84
00:05:04,419 --> 00:05:05,987
run him around your vehicle,

85
00:05:05,988 --> 00:05:08,456
just to be on the safe side.

86
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:12,193
Officer, are we being profiled here?

87
00:05:12,194 --> 00:05:15,429
- I... How do you mean, ma'am?
- Well, I was asleep in the backseat,

88
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:19,800
and you saw two kids driving
at 8:00 in the morning.

89
00:05:19,801 --> 00:05:21,168
You thought maybe drugs?

90
00:05:21,169 --> 00:05:23,103
No.

91
00:05:23,104 --> 00:05:25,706
But if you don't mind,
ma'am, I'd really like

92
00:05:25,707 --> 00:05:28,575
to run my dog around your car,
and you'll be on your way.

93
00:05:28,576 --> 00:05:31,478
And if I do mind?

94
00:05:35,249 --> 00:05:37,550
It's like a police state.

95
00:05:37,551 --> 00:05:40,153
- You should just use Dad's name.
- What?

96
00:05:40,154 --> 00:05:41,695
- Why?
- He'll stop hassling us if he

97
00:05:41,696 --> 00:05:43,656
knows you're connected
with the state's attorney.

98
00:05:43,657 --> 00:05:46,625
That's Cook County. This is Madison
County, and we don't do that.

99
00:05:46,626 --> 00:05:49,528
We don't use Dad's name; We use the law.

100
00:05:50,931 --> 00:05:52,698
You use Dad's name?

101
00:05:52,699 --> 00:05:54,966
How do we use the law?

102
00:06:01,774 --> 00:06:04,209
Hey, Cary, it's Alicia.

103
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:06,578
Do you know anyone in Madison County's

104
00:06:06,579 --> 00:06:07,645
state's attorney's office?

105
00:06:07,646 --> 00:06:09,613
We've just been pulled over

106
00:06:09,614 --> 00:06:13,017
on Interstate 55, and I think
it's a result of profiling.

107
00:06:13,018 --> 00:06:16,153
So I need to get the, uh,
patrol car's dashboard camera.

108
00:06:16,154 --> 00:06:17,955
- Go, Mom.
- Yeah. Get him fired.

109
00:06:17,956 --> 00:06:19,256
You should call his captain.

110
00:06:19,257 --> 00:06:20,390
Sure. I'll see what

111
00:06:20,391 --> 00:06:21,859
I can do. You got the car number?

112
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,194
Yes. It is...

113
00:06:23,195 --> 00:06:26,529
4-1-9. It's an Officer
Robb and it's K-9 unit.

114
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:27,530
No problem.

115
00:06:27,531 --> 00:06:29,632
Oh, yeah, and Eli called.

116
00:06:29,633 --> 00:06:31,393
- Something about the interview.
- I forgot.

117
00:06:31,394 --> 00:06:33,703
Thanks, I'll call him.

118
00:06:33,704 --> 00:06:35,839
- I'm not upset.
- Do I sound upset?

119
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,040
You just threatened to sue us.

120
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:38,842
No, I said I <i>was</i> going to sue you.

121
00:06:38,843 --> 00:06:40,276
That's not a threat; That's a fact.

122
00:06:40,277 --> 00:06:42,385
- I'm packing up and filing a suit.
- David,

123
00:06:42,386 --> 00:06:43,546
this balloon payment came due

124
00:06:43,547 --> 00:06:45,715
at the exact moment we
lost our top client.

125
00:06:45,716 --> 00:06:47,596
We are suffering through
the worst recession...

126
00:06:47,597 --> 00:06:47,983
Okay,

127
00:06:47,984 --> 00:06:49,151
at a certain point, you have

128
00:06:49,152 --> 00:06:50,586
to stop with the recession talk

129
00:06:50,587 --> 00:06:52,521
and <i>own</i> this bankruptcy.

130
00:06:52,522 --> 00:06:55,590
Look, we definitely have some
issues to work out internally,

131
00:06:55,841 --> 00:06:58,042
but if you leave now and file suit...

132
00:07:02,247 --> 00:07:06,551
Yep, always in time for
the Fall of Saigon.

133
00:07:06,552 --> 00:07:08,987
Uh, h-hold on, Eli.

134
00:07:08,988 --> 00:07:10,622
Okay, here's the thing.

135
00:07:10,623 --> 00:07:14,057
I run my dog around your car,
and on the passenger side,

136
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:15,659
he starts scratching and barking.

137
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:19,563
I now have probable cause to
search in the state of Illinois.

138
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:21,464
But I want to give your
son one last chance,

139
00:07:21,465 --> 00:07:24,635
so if he has any small
personal amount of marijuana,

140
00:07:24,636 --> 00:07:27,237
I need to know.

141
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:29,539
Search if you're gonna search.

142
00:07:33,677 --> 00:07:36,812
Sorry, Eli. Actually, I'm gonna be late.

143
00:07:36,813 --> 00:07:39,181
What? Why? We arranged this weeks ago.

144
00:07:39,182 --> 00:07:41,116
Well, circumstances are
beyond my control.

145
00:07:41,117 --> 00:07:43,318
This is a national sit-down, Alicia.

146
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:45,153
You've got to get it under control.

147
00:07:45,154 --> 00:07:46,220
Okay, got to go.

148
00:07:47,221 --> 00:07:48,289
Peggy.

149
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:50,291
I'm just showing Peter
a campaign ad, Eli.

150
00:07:50,292 --> 00:07:51,927
That's all. It's not an ambush.

151
00:07:51,928 --> 00:07:54,762
Let me just say this to
Jax, who is watching

152
00:07:54,763 --> 00:07:57,297
on TV right now and has been

153
00:07:57,298 --> 00:08:01,168
an inspiration to me every
single day of my life.

154
00:08:01,169 --> 00:08:04,471
My dad asked me if it was
all right if he runs,

155
00:08:04,472 --> 00:08:07,841
and I said yeah, 'cause
he does a really good job

156
00:08:07,842 --> 00:08:10,777
of taking care of me, and I
think he'd do a really good job

157
00:08:10,778 --> 00:08:12,244
of taking care of everyone.

158
00:08:12,245 --> 00:08:16,049
I am running for governor of
the great state of Illinois.

159
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:19,251
So, Kresteva is making the
campaign about family values?

160
00:08:19,252 --> 00:08:21,292
Look, I think the campaign's
about a lot of things:

161
00:08:21,293 --> 00:08:22,655
Our bankrupt state,

162
00:08:22,656 --> 00:08:24,591
drugs coming across the
border, education...

163
00:08:24,592 --> 00:08:26,692
But Kresteva is defining himself

164
00:08:26,693 --> 00:08:28,060
as a good father and husband,

165
00:08:28,061 --> 00:08:30,016
and you, in a recent deposition,

166
00:08:30,017 --> 00:08:32,097
are admitting that you are
separated from your wife.

167
00:08:32,098 --> 00:08:33,164
Separated but working

168
00:08:33,165 --> 00:08:35,133
to mend fences. Look, Peggy,

169
00:08:35,134 --> 00:08:36,835
this is gonna be a long campaign.

170
00:08:36,836 --> 00:08:38,536
Kresteva is the Republican candidate

171
00:08:38,537 --> 00:08:40,772
I will be facing in four months.

172
00:08:40,773 --> 00:08:43,908
My goal now is to win the
Democratic nomination.

173
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:45,629
The Democratic Committee
stands beside you,

174
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:47,244
so isn't that a foregone conclusion?

175
00:08:47,245 --> 00:08:49,880
In politics, nothing is
a foregone conclusion.

176
00:08:49,881 --> 00:08:51,582
I win the nomination, you can ask me

177
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:55,486
all you want about Kresteva
and his attempts to, uh...

178
00:08:55,487 --> 00:08:57,687
redefine himself as a family man.

179
00:08:57,688 --> 00:09:00,490
His "attempts"? Do I
detect a hint of sarcasm?

180
00:09:01,241 --> 00:09:04,027
In four months you can
detect a hint of sarcasm.

181
00:09:05,028 --> 00:09:08,397
Okay, I didn't find any drugs
at this time in your vehicle,

182
00:09:08,398 --> 00:09:10,066
but I did find shake, marijuana shake,

183
00:09:10,067 --> 00:09:11,801
under your front seat. What?!

184
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:13,902
My guess is this is what
my dog was signaling.

185
00:09:13,903 --> 00:09:17,139
- Mom, that's... Shh, shh.
- Okay, um, thank you, Officer.

186
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,708
So, I'm gonna give you
a ticket and a warning

187
00:09:19,709 --> 00:09:21,944
at this time and let you go.

188
00:09:21,945 --> 00:09:24,446
So, if there's nothing, uh...

189
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,751
Son, raise your hand.

190
00:09:31,219 --> 00:09:32,920
Son, I said raise your hand.

191
00:09:32,921 --> 00:09:35,356
Is that a recording device?

192
00:09:35,357 --> 00:09:36,991
It's-it's an iPhone.

193
00:09:36,992 --> 00:09:38,693
An iPhone set to record?

194
00:09:40,445 --> 00:09:41,428
Yes.

195
00:09:41,929 --> 00:09:44,718
Recording an officer is a crime, son.

196
00:09:44,719 --> 00:09:46,599
Under Article 14 of the
Illinois Criminal Code,

197
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,240
- it's a Class 1 felony.
- Actually, that

198
00:09:48,241 --> 00:09:50,433
- was overturned in the Seventh Circuit.
- No, it wasn't.

199
00:09:50,434 --> 00:09:52,594
Two-party consent is still on the books.
And I ask you

200
00:09:52,595 --> 00:09:54,675
- to erase that recording right now.
- Wait, so it's

201
00:09:54,676 --> 00:09:56,516
illegal to record you
doing something illegal?

202
00:09:56,517 --> 00:09:58,045
I'm not doing anything illegal,

203
00:09:58,046 --> 00:09:59,479
and either you erase the recording

204
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,048
or I'll impound the phone.

205
00:10:02,049 --> 00:10:03,182
Mom?

206
00:10:03,183 --> 00:10:04,283
Just do it, Zach.

207
00:10:04,284 --> 00:10:06,686
- This is so wrong.
- I know. Just do it.

208
00:10:06,687 --> 00:10:09,621
I need you to erase the recording, son.

209
00:10:09,622 --> 00:10:11,724
Now.

210
00:10:19,097 --> 00:10:20,999
- Did you just e-mail it?
- Okay.

211
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,868
- Everyone, let's just take a breath.
- Son, did you just

212
00:10:23,869 --> 00:10:26,404
- e-mail that recording?
- It was a mistake.

213
00:10:26,405 --> 00:10:28,272
I did.

214
00:10:28,273 --> 00:10:29,974
Put your hands behind your back.

215
00:10:38,518 --> 00:10:43,419
<font color="#FF8C00">Sync & corrections by
Alice</font> <font color="#FF8C00">www.addic7ed.com</font>

216
00:10:45,991 --> 00:10:50,628
We are $60 million in debt, Your Honor.

217
00:10:51,596 --> 00:10:55,099
This is mostly due to
unforeseen circumstances:

218
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,450
The loss of a major client,

219
00:10:56,451 --> 00:10:58,386
late receivables and an...

220
00:10:58,387 --> 00:11:01,589
exponential increase in our lease.

221
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:03,056
We believe if we are given

222
00:11:03,057 --> 00:11:05,393
immediate relief from our
creditors, we will need

223
00:11:05,894 --> 00:11:07,860
five months to satisfy this debt.

224
00:11:07,861 --> 00:11:10,596
My son has a felony notice to appear.

225
00:11:10,597 --> 00:11:12,064
He what?

226
00:11:12,065 --> 00:11:13,399
Why?

227
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,568
The cop said there was
marijuana shake in the car,

228
00:11:15,569 --> 00:11:16,884
- but that's not why.
- Yeah,

229
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:19,005
shake is what they say when
they don't find anything.

230
00:11:19,006 --> 00:11:21,073
What is this, eavesdropping?

231
00:11:21,074 --> 00:11:22,941
Four to 15 years.

232
00:11:22,942 --> 00:11:25,477
Zach was holding a cell
phone in his hand.

233
00:11:25,478 --> 00:11:27,479
He... Where is Zach?

234
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,448
He's at home.

235
00:11:29,449 --> 00:11:31,809
But we have to appear tomorrow
for the preliminary hearing.

236
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:32,885
And why is Mr. Gardner

237
00:11:32,886 --> 00:11:34,553
not standing with you?

238
00:11:34,554 --> 00:11:36,955
I was suspended from the law
for six months, Your Honor.

239
00:11:36,956 --> 00:11:38,196
That suspension ends this week,

240
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:39,997
Then I'll be fighting
alongside Miss Lockhart

241
00:11:39,998 --> 00:11:41,598
to restore our firm to its former glory.

242
00:11:41,599 --> 00:11:43,582
Could you talk to your
friend at Madison County,

243
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:46,063
get this cop's record, see if
there's any disciplinary action.

244
00:11:46,064 --> 00:11:48,032
They're not gonna pursue this, Alicia.

245
00:11:48,033 --> 00:11:49,300
Okay? Don't worry.

246
00:11:49,301 --> 00:11:51,201
The cop just wanted to make a point.

247
00:11:51,202 --> 00:11:52,870
It's on Zach's record.

248
00:11:52,871 --> 00:11:55,038
- He's looking at colleges.
- Okay.

249
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:56,506
I'll give my friend a call.

250
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:57,874
- Thank you.
- No, Mr. Gardner,

251
00:11:57,875 --> 00:12:00,911
if this were before the
Dewey & LeBoeuf bankruptcy,

252
00:12:00,912 --> 00:12:02,278
I'd probably approve this plan,

253
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:04,347
but I see the same
management problems here

254
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:06,015
of excessive debt and compensation.

255
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:07,776
Your Honor, no one wins
if you liquidate us.

256
00:12:07,777 --> 00:12:08,919
I would agree,

257
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,120
but your plan doesn't address
the management issues.

258
00:12:11,121 --> 00:12:12,621
But we're management.

259
00:12:13,622 --> 00:12:15,391
Yes, I know.

260
00:12:17,026 --> 00:12:18,261
<i>Why are we being punished</i>

261
00:12:18,262 --> 00:12:19,762
for Dewey & LeBoeuf?

262
00:12:19,763 --> 00:12:21,597
We have to get the partners together.

263
00:12:21,598 --> 00:12:22,765
Oh, no.

264
00:12:22,766 --> 00:12:24,100
A new client, I forgot.

265
00:12:24,601 --> 00:12:26,569
We can't be turning down new business.

266
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:28,971
Cary and Alicia, we need
you to take this meeting.

267
00:12:29,472 --> 00:12:30,705
What is it?

268
00:12:30,706 --> 00:12:32,374
It's not one

269
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:35,310
of our most prestigious cases.

270
00:12:35,311 --> 00:12:38,180
I own a tow truck company.

271
00:12:39,915 --> 00:12:42,317
Okay, and, uh, how may we help you

272
00:12:42,318 --> 00:12:44,485
with that, Mr. Saverese?

273
00:12:44,486 --> 00:12:45,686
Nick.

274
00:12:45,687 --> 00:12:47,421
So what, I don't get
the partners any more?

275
00:12:47,422 --> 00:12:48,622
Oh, no,

276
00:12:48,623 --> 00:12:52,259
uh, Diane and Will just asked
us to get some detail.

277
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,294
Detail, sure.

278
00:12:53,295 --> 00:12:56,197
Okay, well, I got a lot of detail.

279
00:12:56,198 --> 00:12:58,265
I'm new to town,

280
00:12:58,266 --> 00:13:00,066
and the government is putting out an RFP

281
00:13:00,067 --> 00:13:02,235
to outsource its tow truck service,

282
00:13:02,236 --> 00:13:03,803
but they won't let me bid.

283
00:13:03,804 --> 00:13:04,604
Why not?

284
00:13:04,605 --> 00:13:05,972
Well,

285
00:13:05,973 --> 00:13:08,808
I've had a bit of a problem in my past.

286
00:13:08,809 --> 00:13:10,243
It's nothing big, you know,

287
00:13:10,244 --> 00:13:11,744
it's just, uh, just an arrest.

288
00:13:11,745 --> 00:13:13,113
Nick, let me stop you right there.

289
00:13:13,114 --> 00:13:15,014
You don't want to tell us anything

290
00:13:15,015 --> 00:13:16,982
that might preclude us

291
00:13:16,983 --> 00:13:18,517
from working on your case.

292
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:25,624
- Do you need to go?
- No.

293
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:27,993
I'm fine. Well, here's the thing.

294
00:13:27,994 --> 00:13:30,896
I have two businessmen who want
to partner with me on this bid.

295
00:13:30,897 --> 00:13:33,898
I supply the service,
they act as middlemen.

296
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:37,968
So, I need your firm to vet
them and help me choose one.

297
00:13:39,671 --> 00:13:40,905
Alicia?

298
00:13:40,906 --> 00:13:42,507
Alicia.

299
00:13:43,258 --> 00:13:44,442
So, how is that legal?

300
00:13:44,443 --> 00:13:45,154
How is...

301
00:13:45,155 --> 00:13:47,115
He wants to partner with
someone who doesn't have

302
00:13:47,116 --> 00:13:48,596
an arrest record so he can make a bid

303
00:13:48,597 --> 00:13:50,517
- on a governmental contract.
- Yes, and as long

304
00:13:50,518 --> 00:13:52,916
as we keep the bid at
arm's length, we're fine.

305
00:13:52,917 --> 00:13:53,983
Look,

306
00:13:53,984 --> 00:13:55,752
if we weren't in such bad straights,

307
00:13:55,753 --> 00:13:57,487
we'd probably cut this one loose, but...

308
00:13:57,488 --> 00:13:58,855
No, I get it.

309
00:13:58,856 --> 00:14:01,058
I just, uh, I still have one
leg in the SA's office.

310
00:14:02,059 --> 00:14:03,119
<i>And how long</i>

311
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,760
have you and your
husband been separated?

312
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:06,028
About a year.

313
00:14:06,029 --> 00:14:07,949
So, you were separated
when you stood beside him

314
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:09,731
for his gubernatorial announcement?

315
00:14:09,732 --> 00:14:10,832
Yes.

316
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:12,601
And you didn't find this hypocritical?

317
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:13,969
No.

318
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:17,773
You seem to prefer one-word answers.

319
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:19,907
Yes.

320
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:24,112
Your husband said that you are
working on mending fences.

321
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:25,246
Is that true?

322
00:14:25,247 --> 00:14:26,514
It is.

323
00:14:27,515 --> 00:14:29,851
Can you expand on that?

324
00:14:32,488 --> 00:14:35,222
My husband slept with prostitutes.

325
00:14:35,223 --> 00:14:37,857
That made our marriage difficult.

326
00:14:37,858 --> 00:14:39,626
But we have children together,

327
00:14:39,627 --> 00:14:41,995
and my husband apologized,

328
00:14:41,996 --> 00:14:45,099
and I needed time to consider
whether to accept that apology.

329
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,934
During that time, we separated.

330
00:14:47,935 --> 00:14:49,536
But now you're together?

331
00:14:49,537 --> 00:14:51,870
We're mending fences.

332
00:14:53,907 --> 00:14:55,274
Do you live in his house?

333
00:14:55,275 --> 00:14:57,243
I have my own apartment,

334
00:14:57,244 --> 00:14:59,278
but I also sometimes stay at his house.

335
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:00,746
In the same room?

336
00:15:01,615 --> 00:15:03,483
That's none of your business.

337
00:15:03,484 --> 00:15:05,151
Why not?

338
00:15:05,152 --> 00:15:07,019
Because my life is mine.

339
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,340
But you've made your life public,

340
00:15:08,341 --> 00:15:10,155
- haven't you?
- No.

341
00:15:10,156 --> 00:15:11,723
My husband has.

342
00:15:17,963 --> 00:15:20,063
So, I'd like to ask you this, Alicia:

343
00:15:20,814 --> 00:15:22,633
Why do you stay with your husband?

344
00:15:22,634 --> 00:15:24,468
Why not divorce?

345
00:15:24,469 --> 00:15:28,039
Other wives who've been betrayed
like you have divorced.

346
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,306
Because I don't want to.

347
00:15:29,307 --> 00:15:31,642
Isn't that setting a bad
example to women everywhere

348
00:15:31,643 --> 00:15:33,944
to be such a doormat?

349
00:15:33,945 --> 00:15:34,978
Peggy.

350
00:15:34,979 --> 00:15:36,079
I like my husband.

351
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,347
I respect him.

352
00:15:37,348 --> 00:15:41,551
He's flawed, but I've
grown to accept that.

353
00:15:41,552 --> 00:15:44,354
And I committed to a marriage.

354
00:15:44,355 --> 00:15:46,722
I don't like breaking commitments.

355
00:15:46,723 --> 00:15:48,758
Isn't that dragging
women back to the '50s?

356
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:50,926
Women have all the obligation,

357
00:15:50,927 --> 00:15:52,128
men have all the freedom.

358
00:15:52,129 --> 00:15:53,495
I don't know.

359
00:15:53,496 --> 00:15:55,364
This isn't about women or the '50s.

360
00:15:56,015 --> 00:15:57,566
This is about me.

361
00:16:01,015 --> 00:16:03,566
<i>- Hey there. How's it going?
- Good.</i>

362
00:16:03,815 --> 00:16:06,066
<i>Can I see your driver's
license, regist...</i>

363
00:16:08,473 --> 00:16:09,973
Come on, Drey.

364
00:16:09,975 --> 00:16:11,007
Here you go.

365
00:16:11,009 --> 00:16:13,043
Get it, boy. There you go. Get it, boy.

366
00:16:13,045 --> 00:16:14,261
Dig for it.

367
00:16:14,263 --> 00:16:15,479
What do you got, Drey?

368
00:16:15,534 --> 00:16:16,367
Okay,

369
00:16:16,368 --> 00:16:18,034
you know how you're not supposed to shop

370
00:16:18,035 --> 00:16:20,070
when you're hungry, hmm?

371
00:16:20,071 --> 00:16:22,305
Well, it's just as important
not to do interviews

372
00:16:22,306 --> 00:16:23,474
when you're pissed.

373
00:16:23,475 --> 00:16:24,975
I wasn't pissed, Eli.

374
00:16:24,976 --> 00:16:26,736
And if you don't want
me doing interviews...

375
00:16:26,737 --> 00:16:27,177
What I want

376
00:16:27,178 --> 00:16:28,879
is for you to stay on message.

377
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,248
Kresteva is making
this all about family.

378
00:16:31,249 --> 00:16:33,583
And what's the message
about our separation?

379
00:16:35,686 --> 00:16:37,487
You're right, you're right.

380
00:16:37,488 --> 00:16:39,689
I'll set up a meeting to discuss it.

381
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:42,091
Oh, and I need you to talk

382
00:16:42,092 --> 00:16:45,027
- to the CWA next Thursday.
- I work, Eli.

383
00:16:45,028 --> 00:16:46,929
- I'll talk to Will and Diane.
- No.

384
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:48,029
I want to work, Eli.

385
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:49,230
Peter's free tomorrow night.

386
00:16:49,231 --> 00:16:51,132
We'll discuss it then.

387
00:16:51,133 --> 00:16:53,468
What's that?

388
00:16:53,469 --> 00:16:54,603
Good boy.

389
00:16:54,604 --> 00:16:56,438
What's that? Get that. Get it, boy.

390
00:16:56,439 --> 00:16:57,773
Dig for it.

391
00:16:57,774 --> 00:16:58,973
What do you got, Drey?

392
00:16:58,974 --> 00:17:01,242
<i>Oh, hey, Kalinda,</i>

393
00:17:01,243 --> 00:17:03,211
you have a friend who
trains canines, don't you?

394
00:17:03,212 --> 00:17:04,545
Yeah, why?

395
00:17:04,546 --> 00:17:05,780
I think I was subject

396
00:17:05,781 --> 00:17:07,047
to a bogus search.

397
00:17:07,048 --> 00:17:08,148
Can I talk to him?

398
00:17:08,149 --> 00:17:09,750
- Her. Sure.
- What about our bonuses?

399
00:17:11,453 --> 00:17:13,086
The judge approved the plan.

400
00:17:13,087 --> 00:17:15,127
That's the important thing;
We avoided liquidation.

401
00:17:15,128 --> 00:17:17,190
But... I thought you
were leaving us, David.

402
00:17:17,191 --> 00:17:18,158
And miss this?

403
00:17:18,159 --> 00:17:19,527
Are you kidding?

404
00:17:19,528 --> 00:17:22,195
We avoided liquidation,
but the judge assigned

405
00:17:22,196 --> 00:17:24,597
a trustee to supervise our decisions.

406
00:17:24,598 --> 00:17:26,033
Wait, wait.

407
00:17:26,034 --> 00:17:28,368
Everybody will still get paid.

408
00:17:28,369 --> 00:17:30,404
Everybody will still work on cases,

409
00:17:30,405 --> 00:17:33,707
but new cases will be
vetted by this trustee.

410
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:35,289
- Meaning he can veto you.
- In theory,

411
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:36,810
but he hasn't been assigned to us yet,

412
00:17:36,811 --> 00:17:37,844
so we don't know.

413
00:17:37,845 --> 00:17:39,846
- Excuse me.
- Our hope is that this trustee

414
00:17:39,847 --> 00:17:42,048
will work closely with
us and that he or she

415
00:17:42,049 --> 00:17:45,217
will have as much invested
in our success as we do.

416
00:17:45,718 --> 00:17:47,119
Excuse me?

417
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,988
I'm Clarke Hayden.

418
00:17:48,989 --> 00:17:50,056
Yes?

419
00:17:50,057 --> 00:17:51,723
The trustee.

420
00:17:53,592 --> 00:17:55,793
And the paintings,

421
00:17:55,794 --> 00:17:58,029
are they leased?

422
00:17:58,030 --> 00:17:59,831
No, we own them.

423
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:02,100
But the office furniture is leased?

424
00:18:02,101 --> 00:18:03,168
Yes.

425
00:18:03,169 --> 00:18:04,970
Mr. Hayden,

426
00:18:04,971 --> 00:18:07,638
if I could be so bold.

427
00:18:07,639 --> 00:18:09,739
We have a fairly refined clientele,

428
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:11,908
and if we start dressing
down the office,

429
00:18:11,909 --> 00:18:13,577
they'll notice and leave us.

430
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,027
I think that's enough for today.

431
00:18:31,028 --> 00:18:32,896
What I thought I would do is meet

432
00:18:32,897 --> 00:18:34,063
with you both separately

433
00:18:34,064 --> 00:18:36,132
to discuss the current
staffing situation.

434
00:18:36,133 --> 00:18:39,335
Uh, what current staffing situation?

435
00:18:39,336 --> 00:18:40,970
Reduction.

436
00:18:46,476 --> 00:18:47,943
That's from my personal collection.

437
00:18:47,944 --> 00:18:50,212
It's pretty.

438
00:18:50,213 --> 00:18:52,114
Thanks.

439
00:18:55,418 --> 00:18:57,886
Do you think we've hit bottom yet?

440
00:18:57,887 --> 00:19:00,087
Nope.

441
00:19:23,511 --> 00:19:26,547
Hey, Mom, did you know

442
00:19:26,548 --> 00:19:29,248
you can videotape a cop, you
just can't audiotape them?

443
00:19:29,249 --> 00:19:30,616
Did they teach that at school?

444
00:19:30,617 --> 00:19:34,353
No, it's an old law based
on taping phone calls.

445
00:19:34,354 --> 00:19:36,522
You had to have both parties
agree to record a call.

446
00:19:36,523 --> 00:19:38,591
- What are you reading?
- Oh, it's a Web site

447
00:19:38,592 --> 00:19:39,725
about my rights.

448
00:19:39,726 --> 00:19:41,226
- It's actually pretty cool.
- Yeah.

449
00:19:41,227 --> 00:19:42,595
Looks like some pretty cool stuff.

450
00:19:42,596 --> 00:19:43,996
I'm not looking at that.

451
00:19:43,997 --> 00:19:45,096
Here, look.

452
00:19:45,097 --> 00:19:47,632
This is the e-mail that I sent myself.

453
00:19:47,633 --> 00:19:48,873
I had my phone set to Bluetooth

454
00:19:48,874 --> 00:19:50,569
so I could play music in the car,

455
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:51,736
and I never switched it back.

456
00:19:51,737 --> 00:19:53,337
Okay.

457
00:19:53,338 --> 00:19:54,606
Well, look.

458
00:19:54,607 --> 00:19:57,542
This is what I shot.

459
00:19:58,410 --> 00:19:59,811
But listen.

460
00:20:18,596 --> 00:20:19,629
It's a lovely song.

461
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:20,663
Can we stop it now?

462
00:20:20,664 --> 00:20:22,599
Yes, Your Honor.

463
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,734
My son never recorded audio,

464
00:20:24,735 --> 00:20:26,436
and there can be no Article 14 violation

465
00:20:26,437 --> 00:20:29,038
without audio.

466
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,040
Therefore, we ask this
court to enter a finding

467
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:32,109
of no probable cause.

468
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:34,143
That sounds right to me, ASA Williams.

469
00:20:34,144 --> 00:20:35,311
Your Honor,

470
00:20:35,312 --> 00:20:37,413
sorry to take over here. ASA Altman.

471
00:20:37,414 --> 00:20:39,848
Uh, we would argue that the problem here

472
00:20:39,849 --> 00:20:42,618
was never Article 14, it was
obstruction of justice.

473
00:20:42,619 --> 00:20:45,588
Excuse me, Your Honor, but
that wasn't the charge.

474
00:20:45,589 --> 00:20:46,755
Yes, but we would ask

475
00:20:46,756 --> 00:20:49,325
leave of the court to file
an additional charge.

476
00:20:49,326 --> 00:20:50,826
Your Honor, this is outrageous.

477
00:20:50,827 --> 00:20:52,107
The only one obstructing justice

478
00:20:52,108 --> 00:20:53,948
is Officer Robb with his
illegal traffic stop.

479
00:20:53,949 --> 00:20:55,363
Your Honor, I know Mrs. Florrick

480
00:20:55,364 --> 00:20:58,466
isn't from this county, but
we take unfounded charges

481
00:20:58,467 --> 00:20:59,534
like that very seriously.

482
00:20:59,535 --> 00:21:00,769
Yes, we do.

483
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:02,671
Do you have any evidence to that effect,

484
00:21:02,672 --> 00:21:04,072
- Mrs. Florrick?
- I can gather it.

485
00:21:04,073 --> 00:21:05,373
Then gather it.

486
00:21:05,374 --> 00:21:08,308
And before I hear on the
obstruction of justice charge,

487
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:10,277
I will hear on the legality
of the traffic stop.

488
00:21:14,783 --> 00:21:16,283
This is about my husband, isn't it?

489
00:21:16,284 --> 00:21:18,953
- Excuse me?
- You want to embarrass my husband

490
00:21:18,954 --> 00:21:20,788
by going after my son?

491
00:21:20,789 --> 00:21:22,388
Mrs. Florrick, I don't think we've met.

492
00:21:22,389 --> 00:21:25,058
I'm the state's attorney for
Madison County, Phil Tapia.

493
00:21:25,059 --> 00:21:27,160
I don't go after people.

494
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:28,494
My son is 17 years old.

495
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:30,296
He has nothing to do with politics.

496
00:21:30,297 --> 00:21:31,998
You want to hurt Peter,

497
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:33,299
I'll give you his number.

498
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,135
Maybe you can do me the
honor, Mrs. Florrick,

499
00:21:35,136 --> 00:21:37,803
of talking to me like I'm
not some small-town hood.

500
00:21:37,804 --> 00:21:39,884
- My son did nothing wrong.
- He obstructed justice.

501
00:21:39,885 --> 00:21:41,774
After an illegal traffic stop.

502
00:21:41,775 --> 00:21:43,335
Well, that will be a hard one to prove.

503
00:21:43,336 --> 00:21:44,643
I have to go now.

504
00:21:45,979 --> 00:21:47,880
And you might tell your husband...

505
00:21:48,815 --> 00:21:50,716
police love their pensions.

506
00:21:56,621 --> 00:22:00,123
So, am I in trouble?

507
00:22:00,624 --> 00:22:02,358
Not if I can help it.

508
00:22:02,459 --> 00:22:03,561
Come on.

509
00:22:10,953 --> 00:22:12,953
Petey?

510
00:22:14,454 --> 00:22:17,257
So the issue isn't the dog,
and it's not the trainer.

511
00:22:17,258 --> 00:22:18,991
The issue is the handler.

512
00:22:18,992 --> 00:22:21,561
So, the handler can
force a false positive?

513
00:22:21,562 --> 00:22:24,130
The point is Petey doesn't
need to be encouraged.

514
00:22:24,131 --> 00:22:25,365
He'll alert without prompting.

515
00:22:25,366 --> 00:22:27,634
Now, if I wanted to create
a false positive...

516
00:22:27,635 --> 00:22:28,967
Let's go.

517
00:22:28,968 --> 00:22:31,603
Find it. Where is it?

518
00:22:31,604 --> 00:22:33,071
Where is it? Where is it?

519
00:22:33,072 --> 00:22:34,939
Find it. What's in there, Petey?

520
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:36,975
What's in there? See?

521
00:22:36,976 --> 00:22:38,243
I just found probable cause

522
00:22:38,244 --> 00:22:40,546
to search through your file box.

523
00:22:40,547 --> 00:22:44,015
Get it, boy. Dig for it

524
00:22:44,016 --> 00:22:45,115
That's right.

525
00:22:45,116 --> 00:22:47,451
That's a manufactured false positive.

526
00:22:47,452 --> 00:22:48,653
- Thank you very much
- Yeah..

527
00:22:48,654 --> 00:22:49,720
- Excuse me.
- Mm-hmm.

528
00:22:52,524 --> 00:22:54,124
You see, I'm a good person.

529
00:22:54,125 --> 00:22:56,960
- I never said you weren't.
- My dogs miss you.

530
00:22:56,961 --> 00:22:58,961
You know, I never liked the
way they looked at me.

531
00:22:58,962 --> 00:22:59,863
Oh.

532
00:22:59,864 --> 00:23:02,065
There was always something
a little bit...

533
00:23:04,168 --> 00:23:06,169
What?

534
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:08,205
What is it?

535
00:23:12,976 --> 00:23:14,678
So...

536
00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:16,278
both are stable businessmen.

537
00:23:16,279 --> 00:23:18,614
No liens on credit, financially secure.

538
00:23:18,615 --> 00:23:20,916
But due to preferential hiring

539
00:23:20,917 --> 00:23:22,585
in government bids, we would suggest

540
00:23:22,586 --> 00:23:24,019
partnering with Mr. Wells.

541
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:25,454
'Cause he's black?

542
00:23:25,455 --> 00:23:26,855
Yes.

543
00:23:27,724 --> 00:23:29,891
And who did the vetting for you?

544
00:23:29,892 --> 00:23:31,660
Who? Our investigator.

545
00:23:31,661 --> 00:23:32,893
Can I talk to him?

546
00:23:32,894 --> 00:23:34,729
I got a few questions. Just details.

547
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:36,864
Her, and... sure, yeah.

548
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:41,703
She just took off.

549
00:23:42,771 --> 00:23:44,972
Um, actually, she stepped
out for the moment,

550
00:23:44,973 --> 00:23:47,508
but I'm sure we can answer
any questions you have.

551
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:50,277
No. I like to hear from
the horse's mouth.

552
00:23:50,278 --> 00:23:51,811
When will she be back?

553
00:23:51,812 --> 00:23:53,847
- I don't know. Soon.
- Well,

554
00:23:53,848 --> 00:23:55,549
let's set another appointment.

555
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:59,085
It's just a few more
billable hours, right?

556
00:24:14,933 --> 00:24:15,934
So?

557
00:24:28,947 --> 00:24:30,382
You like that, huh?

558
00:24:38,456 --> 00:24:41,091
Hmm.

559
00:24:41,092 --> 00:24:43,226
Hmm.

560
00:25:13,656 --> 00:25:15,657
What does Will bring to the table?

561
00:25:15,658 --> 00:25:17,192
What does Will, my partner?

562
00:25:18,193 --> 00:25:19,327
Yes.

563
00:25:19,528 --> 00:25:20,696
Everything.

564
00:25:21,864 --> 00:25:23,799
I guess I don't understand the question.

565
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,720
I'm starting at the top

566
00:25:24,721 --> 00:25:26,401
with these interviews
and continuing down.

567
00:25:26,402 --> 00:25:28,042
I want to get a sense
of how things work.

568
00:25:28,043 --> 00:25:31,339
Well, Will is the heart
and soul of litigation.

569
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:33,220
- Not for the last six months.
- Yes. He's been

570
00:25:33,221 --> 00:25:35,909
suspended, which is one of the
reasons we're struggling now.

571
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:38,270
You talk about him like he's a
trial lawyer, not a partner.

572
00:25:38,271 --> 00:25:39,111
Just so we know here.

573
00:25:39,112 --> 00:25:40,913
Will's partnership is
essential to this firm.

574
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:42,349
Wouldn't it be better

575
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:44,351
if only one person was deciding?

576
00:25:45,219 --> 00:25:46,453
No. Don't answer yet.

577
00:25:46,454 --> 00:25:48,221
I want you to think about it.

578
00:25:48,222 --> 00:25:51,858
A lot of my staffing
decisions will depend on it.

579
00:25:52,859 --> 00:25:53,893
<i>You guys ready</i>

580
00:25:53,894 --> 00:25:55,762
- to go to Dad's?
- Yup.

581
00:25:55,763 --> 00:25:57,710
Um, I'm just taking this
'cause it's easier,

582
00:25:57,711 --> 00:25:59,631
and my room's empty at
Dad's house anyway, so...

583
00:25:59,632 --> 00:26:01,967
Mom, did you get the names of
the other people pulled over

584
00:26:01,968 --> 00:26:03,702
- by that cop?
- Not yet. I think

585
00:26:03,703 --> 00:26:06,071
the SA's office is freezing us out. Why?

586
00:26:06,072 --> 00:26:07,973
- I got a few names.
- Really?

587
00:26:09,843 --> 00:26:11,744
- Where did you find them?
- Online.

588
00:26:11,745 --> 00:26:14,579
There's a Web site where people
share stories about police abuse,

589
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,214
and I asked if anyone had difficulties

590
00:26:16,215 --> 00:26:18,016
with an Officer Robb on Interstate 55,

591
00:26:18,017 --> 00:26:20,151
and three people responded.

592
00:26:20,152 --> 00:26:21,519
Here's their numbers.

593
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:25,223
Zach, I'm... I'm really impressed.

594
00:26:26,224 --> 00:26:27,592
I will call these tomorrow.

595
00:26:27,993 --> 00:26:29,393
Actually, I...

596
00:26:29,394 --> 00:26:30,861
You already called them?

597
00:26:30,862 --> 00:26:32,296
Skyped them.

598
00:26:32,297 --> 00:26:33,964
This one guy had his car impounded

599
00:26:33,965 --> 00:26:36,533
for having a single
joint in his ashtray.

600
00:26:36,534 --> 00:26:38,035
And someone else

601
00:26:38,036 --> 00:26:39,370
had $10,000 taken.

602
00:26:39,371 --> 00:26:40,637
Money for a down payment,

603
00:26:40,638 --> 00:26:43,040
but Officer Robb suspected
it of being drug money.

604
00:26:43,041 --> 00:26:44,341
It's a forfeiture corridor.

605
00:26:44,842 --> 00:26:47,276
The police department makes
money off of drug forfeitures.

606
00:26:47,277 --> 00:26:49,653
They stop out-of-town
cars, check for drugs,

607
00:26:49,654 --> 00:26:51,414
and then impound them
if they find anything.

608
00:26:51,415 --> 00:26:53,216
Mom, Dad's here.

609
00:26:55,052 --> 00:26:58,254
Zach, I... I think I
have to say this again.

610
00:26:58,755 --> 00:27:00,890
I'm really impressed.

611
00:27:00,891 --> 00:27:04,025
Wow.

612
00:27:09,281 --> 00:27:11,165
Eli, can we have a minute alone?

613
00:27:12,166 --> 00:27:14,668
Oh. Uh, don't you think we
should do this together?

614
00:27:14,669 --> 00:27:15,970
No, no, it's okay.

615
00:27:15,971 --> 00:27:17,971
But I need to know what
events you'll do together,

616
00:27:17,972 --> 00:27:19,932
or they're gonna ask whether
you live together...

617
00:27:19,933 --> 00:27:21,893
No. Just... just a minute alone.
I really... I...

618
00:27:22,093 --> 00:27:23,794
Sorry about that.

619
00:27:23,795 --> 00:27:26,063
Life under the microscope.

620
00:27:26,064 --> 00:27:27,744
I don't want the kids
doing events, Peter.

621
00:27:27,745 --> 00:27:29,483
- I know.
- Eli is going to insist.

622
00:27:29,484 --> 00:27:31,419
Kresteva is putting his
son front and center.

623
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:32,619
I know.

624
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:34,020
No kids.

625
00:27:34,021 --> 00:27:36,056
Good.

626
00:27:36,057 --> 00:27:38,224
Thanks.

627
00:27:41,261 --> 00:27:42,929
So do we?

628
00:27:44,865 --> 00:27:46,266
Live together.

629
00:27:48,269 --> 00:27:49,901
What did you tell the reporter?

630
00:27:49,902 --> 00:27:52,137
"None of your business."

631
00:27:53,539 --> 00:27:55,540
I think we should probably say

632
00:27:55,541 --> 00:27:58,277
that we're working on it.

633
00:28:01,145 --> 00:28:02,046
Are we?

634
00:28:02,047 --> 00:28:03,367
Well, in the sense that nothing's

635
00:28:03,368 --> 00:28:04,850
definitive, yes.

636
00:28:05,351 --> 00:28:07,050
Why?

637
00:28:07,051 --> 00:28:09,687
Just helps to know the truth.

638
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:11,254
Ah.

639
00:28:12,624 --> 00:28:14,558
Um...

640
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:16,594
I need to tell you something,

641
00:28:16,595 --> 00:28:18,896
because I think it involves you now.

642
00:28:24,167 --> 00:28:25,647
I want to help out with the campaign.

643
00:28:25,648 --> 00:28:27,570
No.

644
00:28:29,272 --> 00:28:30,439
He said what?

645
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,308
He said, "The police
like their pensions."

646
00:28:32,309 --> 00:28:35,344
And I told him that if he
wanted to come after you,

647
00:28:35,345 --> 00:28:37,514
he should leave our son alone.

648
00:28:37,515 --> 00:28:39,048
Peter, I'm handling it.

649
00:28:39,049 --> 00:28:42,184
I don't want to make things worse, okay?

650
00:28:42,185 --> 00:28:44,387
Don't do anything.

651
00:28:52,929 --> 00:28:55,131
You met with the trustee?

652
00:28:55,999 --> 00:28:58,267
What did he say?

653
00:28:59,403 --> 00:29:02,703
He wanted to know my thoughts
on how to reduce staff.

654
00:29:02,704 --> 00:29:04,272
That's it?

655
00:29:04,273 --> 00:29:06,707
No. He...

656
00:29:12,148 --> 00:29:15,083
He asked whether to drop
you as a name partner.

657
00:29:15,084 --> 00:29:19,420
He wondered whether you were
more important as a litigator,

658
00:29:19,421 --> 00:29:21,955
and whether <i>I</i> should
make all the decisions.

659
00:29:21,956 --> 00:29:25,292
Yeah, he said the same thing to me.

660
00:29:25,293 --> 00:29:27,494
- What?
- Our friend Clarke

661
00:29:27,495 --> 00:29:29,930
seems to have learned his
management skills from Mao.

662
00:29:29,931 --> 00:29:31,098
What did he say?

663
00:29:31,099 --> 00:29:32,831
I'm the true litigator. The firm has

664
00:29:32,832 --> 00:29:35,535
suffered through your leadership
over the last six months.

665
00:29:35,536 --> 00:29:37,636
Now it needs a man at the top.

666
00:29:37,637 --> 00:29:40,573
- He didn't say, "A man."
- No.

667
00:29:40,574 --> 00:29:42,975
I added that to piss you off.

668
00:29:43,843 --> 00:29:45,344
We need to get out from under this.

669
00:29:45,345 --> 00:29:48,213
But we need to make $60
million in five months.

670
00:29:48,214 --> 00:29:50,248
Which we can't do.

671
00:29:51,684 --> 00:29:53,885
Not without David Lee.

672
00:29:57,723 --> 00:30:00,459
You have a problem with my stand
on pensions, you come to me.

673
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:02,327
Your son was pulled over.

674
00:30:02,328 --> 00:30:04,095
That's all. I'm following the law.

675
00:30:04,096 --> 00:30:06,530
That's right. Same way
I will with your son

676
00:30:06,531 --> 00:30:08,365
at the University of Chicago.

677
00:30:11,669 --> 00:30:13,770
So we're threatening each other now?

678
00:30:13,771 --> 00:30:16,207
No. I'm threatening you.

679
00:30:16,708 --> 00:30:18,709
And here's a handy little cheat sheet

680
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:20,077
for the next time you forget.

681
00:30:20,078 --> 00:30:22,145
I'm the state's attorney of a county

682
00:30:22,146 --> 00:30:25,047
that actually matters, jackass!

683
00:30:27,882 --> 00:30:29,519
- What do you want?
- <i>Three things.</i>

684
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,854
Drop the case, expunge the arrest,

685
00:30:32,355 --> 00:30:35,158
and tell that stupid
son-of-a-bitch of a traffic cop

686
00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:38,560
to call my son and apologize.

687
00:30:41,364 --> 00:30:43,365
Give me a day.

688
00:30:47,803 --> 00:30:49,671
I did it. It's done.

689
00:30:49,672 --> 00:30:51,940
I don't want to hear about it.

690
00:31:15,355 --> 00:31:17,723
You miss this.

691
00:31:21,777 --> 00:31:24,413
Don't flatter yourself.

692
00:31:41,613 --> 00:31:43,180
Why were you at my work?

693
00:31:44,548 --> 00:31:46,149
Business.

694
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:48,352
What business?

695
00:31:48,853 --> 00:31:50,754
Oh, you know, expanding.

696
00:31:51,755 --> 00:31:53,423
Becoming the tycoon.

697
00:31:53,424 --> 00:31:55,125
Ha!

698
00:32:01,197 --> 00:32:03,164
Were you robbed?

699
00:32:03,165 --> 00:32:05,934
I knew you were coming, so I
put everything into storage.

700
00:32:08,104 --> 00:32:10,372
What? My money, too?

701
00:32:18,246 --> 00:32:20,548
So you don't love me any more.

702
00:32:21,049 --> 00:32:23,651
I want you gone.

703
00:32:30,859 --> 00:32:33,293
What about dinner tomorrow?

704
00:32:33,294 --> 00:32:36,262
Nick... I want you gone.

705
00:32:37,465 --> 00:32:39,533
From Chicago forever.

706
00:32:39,534 --> 00:32:40,967
Yeah, with you.

707
00:32:40,968 --> 00:32:42,736
You're coming home.

708
00:32:42,737 --> 00:32:44,638
No, I'm not coming.

709
00:32:44,639 --> 00:32:46,807
I forgive you, okay?

710
00:32:46,808 --> 00:32:48,908
I just can't stay angry at you.

711
00:32:48,909 --> 00:32:50,843
Well, things have changed.

712
00:32:50,844 --> 00:32:52,611
You see this?

713
00:32:52,612 --> 00:32:55,048
It's my new tattoo.

714
00:32:55,049 --> 00:32:57,150
That is the midnight sun,

715
00:32:57,151 --> 00:32:59,285
and I got it for you.

716
00:33:00,087 --> 00:33:02,188
Means "New beginning."

717
00:33:03,689 --> 00:33:04,589
It's over.

718
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:07,059
You know why it's not over.

719
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,793
You could've run.

720
00:33:08,794 --> 00:33:10,728
You knew I was coming...

721
00:33:12,007 --> 00:33:13,966
But you stayed.

722
00:33:27,378 --> 00:33:29,447
Will. Hi. Is everything okay?

723
00:33:29,448 --> 00:33:32,083
- Yeah. How you doing?
- Good.

724
00:33:32,084 --> 00:33:33,417
I've just been...

725
00:33:33,918 --> 00:33:36,219
well, we've been running
around in separate worlds.

726
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:39,589
- We have.
- Well, if there's anything I can do...

727
00:33:45,028 --> 00:33:47,930
You were interviewed by a
reporter a few days ago?

728
00:33:47,931 --> 00:33:49,999
Yes. Peggy Byrne.

729
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,869
Right. Is there anything I
should know about that?

730
00:33:54,837 --> 00:33:57,639
About my interview? No.

731
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,007
She wants to talk to me.

732
00:33:59,008 --> 00:34:00,308
To you?

733
00:34:00,309 --> 00:34:02,844
She wants to know how we...

734
00:34:02,845 --> 00:34:04,846
work together.

735
00:34:06,048 --> 00:34:08,816
Well, she... I don't think...

736
00:34:08,817 --> 00:34:10,457
She probably just wants
a fuller picture.

737
00:34:10,458 --> 00:34:11,852
Yes.

738
00:34:11,853 --> 00:34:14,054
I suggested she talk to Diane, but...

739
00:34:14,055 --> 00:34:15,689
she said she wanted me.

740
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:18,025
Well, I don't think that she...

741
00:34:18,026 --> 00:34:19,660
- Knows about us?
- Yes.

742
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:23,863
We were... pretty careful.

743
00:34:23,864 --> 00:34:25,999
It's probably nothing.

744
00:34:29,803 --> 00:34:32,171
Well, back to it.

745
00:34:34,808 --> 00:34:37,577
Did you have a dog here yesterday?

746
00:34:37,578 --> 00:34:40,278
Yes. Long story.

747
00:34:40,279 --> 00:34:42,748
Hey, your suspension ends
tonight, doesn't it?

748
00:34:42,749 --> 00:34:43,516
It does.

749
00:34:43,517 --> 00:34:44,517
Welcome back.

750
00:34:44,518 --> 00:34:46,184
Thanks.

751
00:34:46,185 --> 00:34:47,819
Uh, Will?

752
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:50,556
I wonder if you shouldn't talk to her.

753
00:34:50,557 --> 00:34:52,925
The reporter? I was gonna blow her off.

754
00:34:52,926 --> 00:34:53,992
Too busy.

755
00:34:53,993 --> 00:34:55,760
Probably best.

756
00:34:55,761 --> 00:34:57,361
Don't worry.

757
00:34:57,362 --> 00:34:58,829
I got it.

758
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,267
I'm out the door.

759
00:35:03,268 --> 00:35:05,402
- I know.
- So this interview is

760
00:35:05,403 --> 00:35:07,605
a bit pointless, unless
you want me to tell you

761
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:10,641
where all the bodies are buried.

762
00:35:11,777 --> 00:35:14,211
So, what do you want?

763
00:35:14,212 --> 00:35:16,113
You're one of our creditors now.

764
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:18,082
- <i>Your</i> creditor?
- I like to identify

765
00:35:18,083 --> 00:35:19,348
with the firm.

766
00:35:19,349 --> 00:35:22,852
Well, then yes, I am owed $1 million

767
00:35:22,853 --> 00:35:24,520
for my capital contribution,

768
00:35:24,521 --> 00:35:26,790
my yearly draw is five percent,

769
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:29,693
and so I am owed
approximately $3 million.

770
00:35:29,694 --> 00:35:32,762
Hm. It's good that you're leaving, then.

771
00:35:32,763 --> 00:35:34,863
"It's good." What do you mean?

772
00:35:34,864 --> 00:35:36,999
It's less of a burden.
Five cents on the dollar

773
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,201
- makes it $150,000.
- No.

774
00:35:39,202 --> 00:35:43,072
I was a partner... first
money in is first money out.

775
00:35:43,073 --> 00:35:46,274
Mm-hmm, for partners...
but you'll be a creditor.

776
00:35:46,275 --> 00:35:47,610
So thank you.

777
00:35:47,611 --> 00:35:48,811
Wait a minute.

778
00:35:48,812 --> 00:35:50,678
I'll be a creditor in name only.

779
00:35:50,679 --> 00:35:53,047
I put up the capital contribution.

780
00:35:53,048 --> 00:35:55,449
Yes, and thank you. Good luck.

781
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:57,284
Wait.

782
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:00,488
80 cents on the dollar.

783
00:36:00,739 --> 00:36:02,523
Mr. Lee, you misunderstand me.

784
00:36:03,124 --> 00:36:04,487
I'm not negotiating.

785
00:36:04,488 --> 00:36:05,928
You'll get five cents on the dollar,

786
00:36:05,929 --> 00:36:08,049
and you'll get it last...
after we pay off the lease,

787
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:09,730
the furniture, the
bottled water delivery,

788
00:36:09,731 --> 00:36:11,465
then we'll get to you.

789
00:36:12,466 --> 00:36:13,467
Why?

790
00:36:13,968 --> 00:36:15,802
I don't like people who quit.

791
00:36:27,681 --> 00:36:29,241
What do you got, Drey? What's in there?

792
00:36:29,242 --> 00:36:30,950
What's in there? Good, boy.

793
00:36:30,951 --> 00:36:33,419
Your Honor, Officer Robb creates
false positives in order

794
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:35,700
- to search cars for drugs...
- What does this have to do

795
00:36:35,701 --> 00:36:37,301
with obstruction of justice, Your Honor?

796
00:36:37,302 --> 00:36:38,902
There was no obstruction, there was only

797
00:36:38,903 --> 00:36:40,703
an illegal impounding
of my son's cell phone.

798
00:36:40,704 --> 00:36:41,184
Oh, come on.

799
00:36:41,185 --> 00:36:43,550
This section of the interstate
is a forfeiture corridor,

800
00:36:43,551 --> 00:36:46,031
a place where the police and the
state's attorney, Phil Tapia,

801
00:36:46,032 --> 00:36:48,867
make their money from the war on
drugs by illegally impounding cars

802
00:36:48,868 --> 00:36:50,435
and cash.

803
00:36:50,436 --> 00:36:53,437
We have witnesses who haven't
received their cars and cash back

804
00:36:53,438 --> 00:36:56,329
- after stops by Officer Robb.
- Maybe it's not a problem

805
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:59,210
in Mrs. Florrick's county, but we have
a drug problem in Madison County.

806
00:36:59,211 --> 00:37:00,645
Then why are all these stops

807
00:37:00,646 --> 00:37:02,946
being made on the north-running side?

808
00:37:03,447 --> 00:37:05,683
My son checked these traffic stops

809
00:37:05,684 --> 00:37:07,652
resulting in drug searches.

810
00:37:07,653 --> 00:37:09,654
Over the last six months,

811
00:37:09,655 --> 00:37:12,589
90% of them were made on
the north-running side

812
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:14,658
- of the highway.
- Why is that important?

813
00:37:14,659 --> 00:37:16,939
Because all the drugs are
coming from the Canadian border

814
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:19,163
down the <i>south-running</i> side.

815
00:37:19,164 --> 00:37:22,399
And all the money made from these
drug sales heads up the north.

816
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,534
They're not trying to stop drugs.

817
00:37:24,535 --> 00:37:25,836
They're trying to confiscate

818
00:37:25,837 --> 00:37:27,637
the money made from these drug sales.

819
00:37:27,638 --> 00:37:29,338
That is an outrageous lie, Your Honor.

820
00:37:29,339 --> 00:37:30,259
Mr. State's Attorney...

821
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:31,407
Your Honor, these are

822
00:37:31,408 --> 00:37:32,909
very serious allegations.

823
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:33,950
That's putting it lightly.

824
00:37:33,951 --> 00:37:36,312
And we intend to refute them. We ask for

825
00:37:36,313 --> 00:37:38,280
a trial date to give us time to prepare.

826
00:37:38,281 --> 00:37:40,201
For what? For the obstruction
of justice charge,

827
00:37:40,202 --> 00:37:41,350
or for the impounding?

828
00:37:41,351 --> 00:37:43,652
The obstruction charge, of course.

829
00:37:47,557 --> 00:37:49,024
♪ ♪We can do this.

830
00:37:49,025 --> 00:37:50,559
Together we can do it.

831
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,028
Thank you for coming out.

832
00:37:54,529 --> 00:37:56,131
You send your wife against me?

833
00:37:56,132 --> 00:37:57,132
- What?
- You think

834
00:37:57,133 --> 00:37:58,634
Cook County is above our problems?

835
00:37:58,635 --> 00:37:59,995
- Get off my bus.
- You came after

836
00:37:59,996 --> 00:38:01,796
- my forfeiture corridor.
- I don't know what

837
00:38:01,797 --> 00:38:03,597
- you're talking about.
- We are coming after

838
00:38:03,598 --> 00:38:05,373
your son to the fullest
extent of the law.

839
00:38:05,374 --> 00:38:08,109
You want to come after my
corridor, I'll come after yours.

840
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:11,379
My guess is your haul on I-94
is ten times what mine is.

841
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:13,314
And I'm not the one
running for governor.

842
00:38:26,711 --> 00:38:29,713
I just want to say I decided to stay.

843
00:38:29,714 --> 00:38:32,715
You've shown me loyalty; I want
to show you the same in return.

844
00:38:32,716 --> 00:38:34,284
Can't wait to get started.

845
00:38:39,223 --> 00:38:41,258
Just wanted to tell you,

846
00:38:41,259 --> 00:38:44,161
I'm staying. Talk to you later.

847
00:38:50,349 --> 00:38:51,133
Did you...?

848
00:38:51,134 --> 00:38:53,469
Yes. What happened?

849
00:38:54,338 --> 00:38:56,172
What?

850
00:38:57,973 --> 00:38:58,941
I don't know.

851
00:38:58,942 --> 00:39:01,910
Maybe Mao's not so bad
if he works for you.

852
00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:15,656
- Kalinda.
- Hmm?

853
00:39:15,657 --> 00:39:17,325
You okay?

854
00:39:17,326 --> 00:39:18,959
Yeah. Good.

855
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,995
We have another meeting
with that new client.

856
00:39:20,996 --> 00:39:23,663
Um, could you sit in?
He's got some questions

857
00:39:23,664 --> 00:39:25,699
- about the vetting.
- The new client?

858
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:27,501
Mr. Tow Truck. Saverese.

859
00:39:27,502 --> 00:39:29,569
He asked for you yesterday,
but you stepped out.

860
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:31,638
He'll be in in an hour.

861
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:35,976
Wow, you are really
somewhere else today.

862
00:39:37,477 --> 00:39:38,444
Yeah.

863
00:39:38,445 --> 00:39:39,846
Yeah, I'll-I'll sit in.

864
00:39:39,847 --> 00:39:41,915
- Okay, good.
- Hey.

865
00:39:41,916 --> 00:39:43,550
Good job with the video.

866
00:39:43,551 --> 00:39:44,951
I would have never thought of that.

867
00:39:44,952 --> 00:39:47,320
What? What video? The one online

868
00:39:47,321 --> 00:39:49,523
about your traffic stop.

869
00:39:49,524 --> 00:39:51,790
Smart, like "Breakfast in Collinsville."

870
00:39:53,827 --> 00:39:56,795
a ticket and a warning at
this time and let you go.

871
00:39:56,796 --> 00:39:58,296

your driver's license,

878

This is Officer Curtis Robb.

I was wrong.

Really?

893
00:41:11,533 --> 00:41:13,767
Yeah, I think we're dropping the case,

894
00:41:13,768 --> 00:41:15,636

Okay.

898
00:41:21,176 --> 00:41:22,376
Great.

899
00:41:22,877 --> 00:41:24,712
I'm going now.

900
00:41:30,485 --> 00:41:33,487

Hi. I'm Kitty, and I'm ready...
to talk...

903
00:41:50,770 --> 00:41:54,106
I've, uh, given it some thought.

904
00:41:54,107 --> 00:41:55,607
I need Will.

905
00:41:55,608 --> 00:41:58,110
It can't be just one partner.

906
00:41:58,111 --> 00:42:00,112
Lockhart & Associates?

907
00:42:00,113 --> 00:42:01,479
No.

908
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,448
We're a team.

909
00:42:03,449 --> 00:42:04,715
All right.

910
00:42:04,716 --> 00:42:06,717
Then come tomorrow ready to work.

911
00:42:06,718 --> 00:42:09,820
We have to cut 30% from the staff.

912
00:42:12,457 --> 00:42:14,058
Oh.

913
00:42:16,762 --> 00:42:18,963
Ready?

914
00:42:19,930 --> 00:42:21,731
Five, four,

915
00:42:21,732 --> 00:42:24,067
three, two, one.

916
00:42:28,605 --> 00:42:30,674
You're a lawyer again.

917
00:42:33,844 --> 00:42:35,711
Just like that.

918
00:42:40,416 --> 00:42:42,150
An odd year, huh?

919
00:42:42,151 --> 00:42:44,653
I think we're heading
towards an even odder one.
