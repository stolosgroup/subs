{1}{1}23.976
{24}{69}Previously on the good wife,
{69}{126}- Sorry about that, Mr...|- McVeigh.
{126}{176}Oh, my goodness. What an unfortunate name.
{176}{214}Hopefully no relation.
{214}{287}- Oh, I've offended you?|- No...
{287}{345}No, I'll talk to you soon.
{345}{455}I think I've just been|visited by the Marlboro man.
{455}{504}They're playing craps|with that kid's life.
{504}{580}No, you listen. I know you did everything.
{605}{755}Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.|Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
{825}{850}We're not gonna talk about this.
{850}{891}We're not gonna say any more.
{891}{976}We're gonna go to dinner in one|week's time, and we'll talk then.
{1164}{1196}Hey.
{1337}{1366}Let's go to the bedroom.
{1366}{1396}No. Here.
{1658}{1686}So we can talk now, right?
{1686}{1729}I mean, the trial's over. We can talk now.
{1729}{1753}Yeah, we can talk.
{1753}{1806}We can swear. We can do whatever we want.
{1806}{1915}Okay, so, we'll do bathroom breaks|first, then, uh, get down to it.
{1915}{1958}So, uh, what do you think?
{1958}{2003}- Guilty, right?|- She did it.
{2003}{2071}Actually, I think we|should wait. For everybody.
{2071}{2139}Did you see her at the defense table?
{2139}{2174}Which her?
{2174}{2207}The one with the televangelist?
{2207}{2269}- No, no, no. Um, the one who sucked the toes.|- Huh?
{2269}{2306}Oh, come on. What was his name?
{2306}{2335}The prostitute.
{2335}{2378}You're talking about the defense attorney?
{2378}{2403}She's the wife, right?
{2403}{2444}Right. I thought I recognized her.
{2444}{2481}At the defense table.
{2499}{2556}Reasonable doubt.
{2556}{2648}What do we mean by reasonable doubt?
{2648}{2677}I thought the husband got out.
{2677}{2723}- Didn't he get out?|- Boy, talk about using her.
{2723}{2765}Putting her at the|defense table like that.
{2766}{2798}She's there 'cause she's a good lawyer.
{2830}{2861}Okay. Okay, okay.
{2861}{2892}Everybody ready?
{2892}{2950}Do we want to vote first?
{2950}{2988}Right. Good idea.
{2988}{3044}Um, everyone take a pad.
{3044}{3272}So when you take that vote, you have to ask|yourself, is this young woman capable of murder?
{3333}{3488}Could Bianca Price pick up a gun and|shoot her sorority mate in the chest?
{3488}{3522}Okay.
{3522}{3571}Six guilty, six not guilty.
{3571}{3658}- Of course.|- Which is so odd, given we have six men and six women.
{3658}{3724}Oh, what are you saying,|this is a sexist thing?
{3724}{3777}Well, of course not. This has|nothing to do with her looks.
{3777}{3810}True. That's right.
{3810}{3855}She's just a sweet|girl having a threesome.
{3855}{3911}That's because men can't imagine
{3911}{3939}a pretty woman killing somebody.
{3939}{3973}Oh, come on.
{3973}{4020}It's because the prosecution|didn't do their job.
{4020}{4053}- Exactly.|- Oh, fine.
{4053}{4114}Sure, I voted not guilty,|but not because of her looks.
{4114}{4188}Why isn't it just as likely that|women are jealous of her looks?
{4188}{4214}Thank you, brother.
{4214}{4246}You are so over the line.
{4246}{4275}- Thank you.|- He's right.
{4275}{4311}- So over the line.|- He's right.
{4311}{4357}Women look at that girl|and think home wrecker.
{4358}{4401}Except she's not a girl.|She's a grown woman.
{4402}{4438}Okay, but Saint...|what... what's her name?
{4438}{4481}- Alicia.|- Right, Alicia Florrick.
{4481}{4530}She was sitting right next|to her, supporting her.
{4530}{4607}And defense attorneys could|never be pulling tricks.
{4634}{4665}Let's just stick to the facts, huh?
{4665}{4726}All right, all right,|everybody, raised hands, please.
{4726}{4756}One at a time.
{4756}{4783}Marisol.
{4783}{4826}Okay, take the cop, the Detective.
{4826}{4863}Back on the first day of testimony,
{4863}{4901}he looked right at us and said...
{4901}{4932}The accused was covered with blood.
{4932}{4991}And she was the only one|in the room with the victim.
{4991}{5025}And the murder weapon?
{5026}{5079}9mm auto 6-round.
{5079}{5150}It was the defendant's,|registered in her name.
{5249}{5302}Given to her by her mother for protection.
{5302}{5362}The weapon was found on|the ground by her feet?
{5362}{5389}Yes, sir.
{5390}{5443}With her fingerprints on the trigger.
{5470}{5521}I have a question.
{5521}{5585}Who was the girl who entered|in the middle of his testimony?
{5586}{5645}Oh, that's right. He smiled at her.
{5646}{5690}I thought she was with the defense.
{5690}{5749}There was a party|downstairs for spring break.
{5749}{5773}30 individuals.
{5773}{5824}- And they heard the shot?|- Yes, sir.
{5824}{5874}Within 30 seconds, they|burst into the sorority room
{5874}{5949}and found the accused, Bianca|Price, standing over the victim.
{5949}{6010}How long after the murder|was this photo taken?
{6010}{6066}Approximately 30 seconds.
{6066}{6132}That's the good news about|murders at colleges these days.
{6132}{6191}Everybody has a cell phone|camera, so it makes it hard
{6191}{6233}-to get away with murder.|-Objection!
{6234}{6290}That wasn't a question, Mr. Gardner.
{6318}{6411}But I would warn the witness|to avoid editorializing.
{6411}{6440}My apologies, Your Honor.
{6440}{6508}- Now, this happened at her sorority house?|- Yes, sir.
{6508}{6556}There was blood all over|her. And this was taken
{6556}{6598}within 30 seconds of the gunshot,
{6598}{6657}and here she is with the gun at her feet.
{6657}{6695}She said she was in the|bathroom, and she came out.
{6695}{6723}No, she didn't say that.
{6723}{6749}Her lawyer said that.
{6749}{6829}Now Bianca has said she was in the|bathroom when she heard the shot.
{6830}{6876}Objection, Your Honor. Not in evidence.
{6876}{6922}Mr. Gardner, I expect more of you.
{6922}{6977}Your Honor, I'm sorry. My mistake.
{6977}{7031}Okay, I'll say it.
{7031}{7062}I didn't trust that cop.
{7062}{7123}And his earring. What was that?
{7123}{7161}Men wear earrings these days.
{7161}{7199}And what about the five o'clock shadow?
{7199}{7234}So what are you saying?
{7234}{7273}You don't trust him|because he didn't shave?
{7273}{7305}So, Detective Burton, you were
{7305}{7339}the first officer on the scene?
{7339}{7382}Yes, Mr. Gardner.
{7382}{7415}And where was your partner?
{7415}{7441}He was out sick.
{7442}{7481}So you were there unobserved?
{7482}{7532}Yes, I was unobserved,
{7532}{7605}except for the two dozen other|college students in the room.
{7605}{7651}And you've never tampered|with evidence, Detective?
{7651}{7684}That's correct, sir.
{7684}{7723}I've never tampered with evidence.
{7723}{7818}And so if I asked you about|this internal affairs report...
{7818}{7853}Objection, Your Honor!
{7854}{7883}Mr. Gardner, really.
{7883}{7915}Up here.
{7915}{7990}Then what about the|internal affairs report?
{7990}{8018}What internal affairs report?!
{8018}{8053}We didn't hear anything about that.
{8053}{8090}It could have been completely innocent.
{8090}{8117}Are you serious?
{8178}{8228}This charge is irrelevant,|and it was minor.
{8228}{8258}Drinking beer on duty?
{8258}{8297}You are playing with|fire here, Mr. Gardner.
{8298}{8383}Your Honor, any internal affairs|charge is completely relevant.
{8383}{8425}No, sir. You're trying|to imply to the jury
{8426}{8490}that something more|nefarious is going on here...
{8490}{8541}that Detective Burton planted evidence.
{8541}{8632}Let's at least be adults here and|admit to each other what you're doing.
{8632}{8705}Your Honor, no. Oh...|oh, my God, no. No. I...
{8706}{8743}Look, I will admonish the jury.
{8743}{8789}That's all I can do, Mr. Brody.
{8790}{8841}And you watch it, Mr. Gardner.
{8882}{8916}Go to hell.
{8916}{8953}Having fun?
{9006}{9033}Wait. Wait. Wait.
{9033}{9077}The Judge admonished|us not to consider it.
{9078}{9117}All right, I won't consider it,
{9117}{9147}but I still don't trust speedy.
{9147}{9234}We'll reconvene here 9:30 tomorrow.
{9450}{9509}So, you enjoy tarnishing my reputation?
{9510}{9561}Best part of my day.
{9590}{9617}Hey, Jimmy, man.
{9617}{9666}What's up?
{9766}{9823}I don't think they liked me.
{9823}{9868}Who, the jury? No. You can never tell.
{9868}{9901}I just...
{9902}{9959}Sound so terrible.
{9959}{9997}I think I'd find me guilty.
{9997}{10069}No, that's just the prosecution's case.
{10069}{10121}You wait for our turn.
{10122}{10155}Thank you.
{10155}{10191}You're welcome. Any time.
{10191}{10224}Thank you.
{10224}{10275}I'll see you, mom.
{10374}{10424}How did it go, did you think?
{10424}{10461}It's a good start.
{10462}{10513}I'm sorry, but we're|playing catch-up here.
{10513}{10562}Your previous lawyers|did no investigation,
{10562}{10596}and Cuesta isn't allowing a delay,
{10596}{10635}so we're gonna hit a few bumps.
{10635}{10701}We're gonna need to spend some more|money on a better ballistics expert.
{10701}{10736}Are you all right with that?
{10736}{10786}Whatever it takes.
{10786}{10860}She's my only child.
{10860}{10914}The thought of her in prison is...
{11066}{11104}Good work.
{11104}{11149}Thanks.
{11194}{11230}Is everything okay?
{11230}{11267}Yeah. Why? Yeah. Good.
{11494}{11564}I heard you did well.
{11564}{11627}There's more women on|this jury than I wanted.
{11627}{11710}Sometimes I think justice would|be better served with a coin flip.
{11731}{11757}Who's that?
{11758}{11796}Oh, uh, mother Jones.
{11796}{11849}Doing a profile.
{11883}{11917}Sorry about that.
{11917}{11979}We're knee-deep in|the Bianca Price trial.
{11979}{12030}You were just saying about pro-choice.
{12030}{12078}Oh, yes, it's an irony of our times
{12078}{12146}that "activist Judge" used to be a charge
{12146}{12193}hurled by Republicans at...
{12251}{12303}Democrats?
{12303}{12331}Excuse me?
{12331}{12371}Hurled at democrats?
{12371}{12409}Oh, uh, yes.
{12409}{12443}I was, um...
{12443}{12589}The charge of activist Judge,|especially with regards to...
{12635}{12677}Um...
{12678}{12731}My goodness, I forgot|what I was, uh, saying.
{12731}{12772}Choice is endangered.
{12772}{12833}Oh, yes, choice.
{12834}{12878}It is.
{12878}{12917}Could you give me a minute?
{12988}{13067}Thank you for the Sarah Palin biography.
{13126}{13165}Oh, I, uh, I thought you'd like that.
{13165}{13250}The chapter where she|brings big oil to heel.
{13250}{13289}Just gripping.
{13289}{13410}I bought a, uh... a Hillary|bio for 50 cents on eBay.
{13410}{13487}So you're, uh...
{13487}{13550}Will says he wants you on|the Bianca Price murder?
{13550}{13577}Yeah. Yeah.
{13577}{13640}I'm, uh... I'm in town|testifying on another case.
{13640}{13681}Good.
{13681}{13733}Well, I... I just wanted to say hello.
{13734}{13761}Hello.
{13762}{13821}You betcha.
{13933}{13983}Uh, you know my rules.
{13983}{14059}If, uh... if I find out|the client's guilty, I quit.
{14059}{14102}Yup. I like your rules.
{14102}{14139}Even more, I like your fees.
{14139}{14168}Well, th...
{14168}{14210}Yeah?
{14210}{14257}I thought I'd sit in.
{14274}{14309}Miss Lockhart.
{14309}{14370}Mr. McVeigh.
{14426}{14503}So, the problem is, the mom|fired her previous lawyers
{14503}{14553}because they wanted to plead this out.
{14554}{14641}So they lined up Jim Crosby|as a ballistics expert.
{14641}{14686}Well, I agreed to meet with you.
{14686}{14717}You did. Thanks.
{14717}{14792}And I agreed to look over|the evidence, give you a bid.
{14792}{14822}Which is?
{14843}{14883}I'm not taking this case.
{14883}{14925}She's guilty.
{14957}{14992}Sorry.
{14992}{15031}I can give you some names
{15031}{15069}of people who will say differently,
{15070}{15108}but I wouldn't go with Crosby.
{15108}{15159}He's not convincing enough.
{15159}{15189}Um, you're positive?
{15190}{15231}She's guilty?
{15231}{15296}Given the evidence, yes.
{15296}{15355}If I were you, I'd plead out.
{15355}{15395}Good luck.
{15448}{15545}The jury needs to be told a story.
{15545}{15594}The prosecution's story is simple:
{15594}{15650}Bianca shot her best friend
{15650}{15698}out of jealousy after a threesome.
{15698}{15750}Our story needs to be just as simple:
{15750}{15816}Bianca didn't shoot Heather.
{15816}{15916}Yes, it was Bianca's gun, but her|mother had given it her for protection.
{15916}{15953}What we need to tell the jury
{15953}{16009}is who else had access to Bianca's gun?
{16009}{16042}Joshua Mundy...
{16042}{16076}See any difference?
{16076}{16117}He was with the girls for the threesome,
{16118}{16152}who shot Heather while|Bianca was in the bathroom.
{16152}{16193}No. Why?
{16194}{16253}Regarding the witness prep, Cary, Alicia,
{16253}{16305}we're gonna have to delay|on the ballistics expert.
{16306}{16343}- Why?|- We lost him.
{16343}{16368}We're shopping.
{16368}{16392}Okay, that's everything.
{16392}{16459}We got court in one hour, so let's go.
{16495}{16519}Will?
{16519}{16551}What's up?
{16551}{16605}This cell phone photo on|Jenny Bauer's student page,
{16606}{16659}it's different than the|one she gave to the police.
{16659}{16726}There. On this one, that|guy's foot is on the rug,
{16726}{16763}and on this one it's not.
{16763}{16799}She took another picture?
{16799}{16847}Only a split second between both shots.
{16847}{16898}It's on video.
{16898}{16948}Cell phone video.
{16969}{17003}Find it.
{17074}{17102}I'll get that for you.
{17102}{17130}Thanks.
{17130}{17222}I don't know if we're gonna|put Bianca on the stand yet,
{17222}{17293}but if we do, are you|all right questioning her?
{17293}{17349}I'm... yes.
{17350}{17424}But I think Cary would do a better job.
{17424}{17448}Why?
{17448}{17501}They seem to have bonded.
{17501}{17602}15 years of doing this|and I still can never tell
{17602}{17637}who's innocent and who's guilty.
{17637}{17756}Everybody's a mystery from|the outside, including Bianca.
{17879}{17920}We still haven't had our dinner.
{17920}{17975}I know.
{17975}{18023}You worried about Peter?
{18088}{18149}I'm worried about everything.
{18149}{18201}I'm not.
{18202}{18441}Sync by yyets. Net - corrected by chamallow35|www.addic7ed.com
{18594}{18642}All right, all right...
{18642}{18736}All right! Everybody, let's|talk one at a time, please.
{18736}{18767}Marisol.
{18767}{18806}Of course he was scuzzy.
{18806}{18856}I don't want to marry|him. I just believe him.
{18856}{18903}It was Heather's idea.
{18903}{18971}- Heather Cross, the victim?|-Yeah.
{18971}{19011}She's never done a three-way before
{19011}{19061}on zolpidem, and she wanted to.
{19061}{19128}- This was the night before|spring break. - Yeah-huh.
{19128}{19234}She came to me downstairs,|and she was, like, um...
{19234}{19288}Do you want me to quote?
{19289}{19350}'Cause if I quote, I|have to use that word.
{19350}{19417}Oh, no, you don't, Mr.|Mundy, not in my court.
{19417}{19491}When you feel so inclined, you are|welcome to use the word "fluff."
{19491}{19553}And Judy... delicate flower that she is...
{19553}{19617}will translate it into|its proper form. Yes, Judy?
{19636}{19702}Okay. So, um...
{19702}{19757}there was, like...
{19757}{19884}"Do you want to go... fluff|upstairs with Bianca on zolpidem?"
{19884}{19915}And I was, like...
{19915}{19986}it was something she read in|the whole Tiger Woods thing...
{19986}{20053}zolpidem sex, you know? Relaxed and crazy.
{20053}{20152}And I was, like, you know?
{20152}{20201}No, I don't know, Mr. Mundy.
{20201}{20258}You'll have to use your words.
{20258}{20337}I was, like, "sure."
{20337}{20434}I mean, um... "fluff, yeah."
{20434}{20502}Oh, the joy my life is.
{20502}{20529}Have you got that, Judy?
{20529}{20609}And you and Bianca had been dating?
{20609}{20648}Yeah.
{20648}{20696}And she was always kinda|freaking out about women,
{20696}{20748}so I was surprised that|she agreed to go with us.
{20748}{20815}"Freaking out"" meaning jealous?
{20815}{20853}Yes.
{20873}{20927}Then what happened?
{20927}{20992}Well, we... fluffed.
{21017}{21075}And I mean fluffed.
{21075}{21113}And, uh, I left the two of them
{21113}{21152}kinda out of it in Bianca's room,
{21152}{21206}and I went downstairs to grab a brew.
{21206}{21255}And that's when we heard the shot.
{21255}{21400}And I raced upstairs, and I found|Heather on the floor, you know, like,
{21400}{21527}really red with blood|and the gun on the floor.
{21925}{21968}Oh, that's right.
{21968}{21994}You're here on another case.
{21994}{22021}That's right. We're ready.
{22021}{22053}You want to watch?
{22053}{22129}Oh, well, I... I would, but I'm late.
{22272}{22301}Dinner?
{22301}{22375}Tomorrow night, 8:00 p.m., the Westin.
{22375}{22453}I, uh, uh, o... okay.
{22579}{22645}So, you'd been dating Bianca for a while?
{22645}{22693}Uh, a little while, yeah.
{22693}{22793}A little while, as in two dates?
{22793}{22860}Yeah, I guess.
{22860}{22955}And by "dates," we mean|you slept with her twice?
{22974}{23003}Yeah.
{23003}{23042}You have that effect on women?
{23042}{23105}They get jealous after two dates?
{23105}{23161}Objection. Argumentative.
{23161}{23209}Sustained, regrettably.
{23209}{23308}Now about this zolpidem that Heather|and Bianca took, you took it, too?
{23308}{23333}Yeah.
{23333}{23415}And you know zolpidem is a|non-benzodiazepine hypnotic?
{23415}{23448}What?
{23448}{23493}You can hallucinate on it.
{23493}{23566}You might also get diarrhea.
{23566}{23669}Well, I...I didn't get diarrhea.
{23669}{23716}Good. I'm so glad.
{23716}{23763}But did you hallucinate?
{23763}{23794}No.
{23794}{23835}It's also a drug that|can cause memory loss.
{23835}{23863}Did you know that?
{23863}{23953}No. In fact, let's do an experiment.
{23953}{23977}Objection.
{23977}{24024}You know I like experiments, Mr. Brody.
{24024}{24057}Overruled.
{24057}{24150}What color panties was|Bianca wearing that night?
{24150}{24238}What color? Uh...
{24238}{24264}White.
{24264}{24321}Well, that is a very|good guess, Mr. Mundy,
{24321}{24413}given that 85% of the panties|sold in the U.S. are white.
{24413}{24451}And yet you're wrong.
{24451}{24500}They were black.
{24538}{24595}See? That was silly.
{24595}{24631}Men don't remember things like that.
{24631}{24699}The color of a woman's|panties? Are you kidding me?
{24699}{24724}Not at that moment.
{24744}{24832}And you're telling me she's|having sex with her boyfriend,
{24832}{24900}another girl, and she's not jealous?
{24900}{24955}Well, actually, that was a stretch for me.
{24955}{25004}I mean, she only slept with the guy twice.
{25004}{25038}That doesn't make him a boyfriend.
{25038}{25066}So are you changing sides?
{25066}{25106}Now you're not guilty?
{25106}{25136}No. I don't know.
{25136}{25159}I just...
{25159}{25222}The motive seemed ridiculous.
{25222}{25278}College today... a threesome|doesn't mean anything.
{25278}{25311}I'm getting old.
{25311}{25351}I'm going back to college.
{25381}{25413}All right.
{25413}{25459}I think we should take|another vote with our hands.
{25459}{25511}All those in favor of not guilty?
{25586}{25617}Seven to five.
{25617}{25646}Now we're getting somewhere.
{25646}{25755}I want to know how those voting|not guilty can explain the picture.
{25774}{25830}What I don't understand, Miss Bauer,
{25830}{25866}is I looked at your student page,
{25866}{25915}and there's a different shot.
{25915}{25956}See, this one's from an earlier frame,
{25956}{26010}and this one's from a later one...
{26010}{26094}From your cell phone video.
{26094}{26134}Are you with the cops?
{26134}{26211}Well, I've been assigned to investigate.
{26211}{26242}I erased it.
{26242}{26290}The video?
{26318}{26362}I don't believe you.
{26362}{26408}Anyone who brags about helping the police
{26408}{26474}on their student page|isn't gonna erase anything.
{26551}{26635}Look, I wasn't trying to|hide anything from the police.
{26635}{26670}I know you weren't.
{26670}{26753}It's just I'd never done it before.
{26753}{26786}Done what?
{26786}{26844}Okay, Tim,
{26844}{26897}I do this for you...
{26897}{26974}You do this for me.
{26974}{27062}I was drunk. We were just sexting.
{27062}{27090}If my parents saw this...
{27090}{27118}It's okay.
{27118}{27158}We don't need to tell them.
{27218}{27277}Josh went up before the gunshot.
{27277}{27302}What?
{27302}{27335}Josh went up before the gunshot.
{27335}{27375}He said he went up afterwards.
{27814}{27858}Oh, my God!
{27858}{27909}We need to get out of here.
{27909}{27959}Who's Josh talking to?
{28014}{28058}Who's that?
{28058}{28103}I've seen him at the gym.
{28103}{28144}Josh is always hanging out with him.
{28144}{28227}I think he's on the|coaching staff or something.
{28227}{28293}This guy. Who is he?
{28293}{28367}Oh, Ernie Suarez, assistant|to the athletic director.
{28367}{28422}Does he have a locker here... Ernie?
{28422}{28498}Yeah, a coach locker, but|he hasn't cleared it out yet.
{28498}{28530}It's right there.
{28545}{28583}You got the keys?
{28583}{28649}Um, don't you need a warrant or something?
{28649}{28682}Yeah, if I were a cop.
{28682}{28721}I can get bolt cutters in here,
{28721}{28783}but it'd be easier if you just opened it.
{28783}{28814}So you're not a cop?
{28814}{28843}No.
{28843}{28886}- And you're not with|campus police? - Mm-mm.
{28886}{28936}So who are you?
{28936}{28983}Kalinda.
{29222}{29304}Whoa.
{29414}{29478}Someone's been busy.
{29562}{29632}Campus police checked the|serial number on the computers.
{29632}{29685}They're from a series|of 30 campus burglaries
{29685}{29724}- over the last year.|- Good.
{29724}{29779}So the narrative is|this: Josh killed Heather
{29779}{29824}after she discovered him|burglarizing her room.
{29824}{29900}Mm-hmm. Listen, I'm gonna go|catch a ride with campus police
{29900}{29952}when they go check Josh's|room for more stolen goods.
{29952}{29980}Good.
{29980}{30027}Is that our ballistics expert?
{30054}{30100}We'll see. I'm interviewing him now.
{30136}{30204}God help us.
{30239}{30281}- What's going on?|- What?
{30281}{30315}Is going on?
{30315}{30360}Will doesn't even look at you anymore.
{30360}{30397}He does.
{30397}{30444}You been a bad girl?
{30500}{30548}Going now.
{30629}{30680}In other news,
{30680}{30788}Sarah Palin spoke to party members in|Texas as part of her nationwide tour.
{30872}{30928}We need a commander in chief,
{30928}{31006}not a professor of law|standing at the lectern.
{31006}{31043}America is ready...
{31158}{31210}So, professor, you're|saying this is consistent
{31210}{31307}with the prosecution witness, Josh Mundy,|firing the weapon that killed the victim?
{31307}{31365}Yes. This is... yes, I am.
{31365}{31430}Even without evidence of|gunshot residue on his hands?
{31430}{31462}Yes, that's right.
{31462}{31503}Could you explain?
{31503}{31542}Well, yes, I, um...
{31578}{31633}Uh, let's see, uh...
{31633}{31661}Here we go.
{31661}{31751}So the path of the bullet, um...
{31751}{31777}Darn it.
{31777}{31828}The gun was at chest level,
{31828}{31903}held by someone as tall as the accused,
{31903}{31974}and was shot from three feet away.
{31974}{32007}The defense ballistic expert...
{32007}{32064}- when he finally got his laser pointer working...|- Objection.
{32064}{32120}Withdrawn.
{32120}{32204}He argued that the gunshot residue|found on Bianca Price's hands
{32204}{32271}could have come from her|contact with the victim.
{32271}{32314}Does that seem likely to you?
{32314}{32338}No.
{32338}{32386}I don't know.
{32386}{32533}Two experts say the exact opposite|thing, and they're both 100% certain.
{32533}{32590}So what do we do with that?
{32590}{32670}There was this CSI: New|York, where the gun residue
{32670}{32742}was transferred from|one person to another.
{32742}{32781}They say it happens all the time.
{32781}{32812}But that's TV.
{32812}{32867}- Yeah, but I've heard it some other place.|- Me, too.
{32867}{32918}So it's not impossible.
{32918}{32997}It's also weird how little there|is, you know, physical evidence.
{32997}{33025}There's the GSR.
{33025}{33066}Yeah, but what about the forensic stuff?
{33066}{33122}The DNA?
{33122}{33186}So, wait, you two are changing your minds?
{33226}{33269}So, let's take another vote.
{33269}{33341}All those in favor of not guilty.
{33402}{33430}Okay, six to six.
{33430}{33508}Yeah, but it's a different|six, so that's progress.
{33508}{33570}Campus police. Coming in.
{33630}{33676}All right, go ahead, check it out.
{34244}{34293}Anything?
{34311}{34363}Is your plan just to follow me?
{34363}{34434}Yep. It's the only way I can get|more from you than you from me.
{34434}{34490}What's up?
{34542}{34726}Josh finishes his threesome, goes|downstairs to get a beer in his shirtsleeves.
{34726}{34750}Where did you get this?
{34750}{34788}Josh heads back upstairs.
{34788}{34834}Bianca in the bathroom hears the gunshot.
{34834}{34923}Everybody runs up and|seconds later, as if by magic,
{34923}{34948}Josh in his leather jacket.
{34948}{34996}Mm-hmm. He's cold.
{34996}{35045}He puts on a jacket, it happens.
{35045}{35129}Or he uses it to cover the|gunshot residue off his hands.
{35129}{35166}Are you writing fiction these days?
{35166}{35242}There's only one way to find out.
{35242}{35289}Check that for gunshot residue.
{35441}{35513}Where would I go?
{35513}{35576}What do you mean?
{35576}{35613}What prison?
{35613}{35670}Dwight correctional center.
{35670}{35702}Is that big?
{35702}{35769}I don't know.
{35878}{35971}- We've got a really good case.|- I know.
{35971}{36099}Just the people at|school, they don't visit.
{36099}{36170}If my roommate were in prison,|I guess I wouldn't either.
{36218}{36262}I don't know.
{36262}{36316}45 years.
{36316}{36376}That's a worst-case scenario.
{36376}{36438}Would you visit me?
{36478}{36526}Yes.
{36526}{36570}Thank you.
{36605}{36662}I'm being stupid.
{36662}{36686}No.
{36686}{36747}No, you're not being stupid.
{36854}{36914}This silently stoic thing...
{36914}{36966}that's all just a pose, right?
{36966}{37046}When you get home, you|start spouting Proust?
{37046}{37110}Yep.
{37110}{37156}Yep.
{37156}{37205}Well, to cowboys.
{37205}{37281}Who knew I loved cowboys?
{37329}{37358}Maybe it's in our DNA.
{37358}{37393}Part of being American.
{37393}{37465}You don't need to talk like that.
{37499}{37593}I do need to talk like that,|because that's how I talk.
{37709}{37800}You know, there's a selfishness|to the silence of the cowboy...
{37800}{37901}forcing everybody else to carry|the weight of the conversation.
{38330}{38366}Whew, what am I doing?
{38366}{38410}No, I mean, really, what am I doing?
{38410}{38454}You're having dinner.
{38497}{38570}I mean, you like Sarah|Palin, and I... I...
{38570}{38626}I think she's the devil incarnate.
{38626}{38685}Yep.
{38685}{38722}And choice...
{38722}{38778}I mean, how can you be|for back alley abortions?
{38778}{38832}The murder of 1.2...
{38832}{38889}Don't... don't talk.
{38889}{38942}Stoically silent?
{39017}{39070}I can't.
{39070}{39099}I can't, I'm sorry.
{39099}{39149}I want to, but I... I can't.
{39186}{39222}You have to go?
{39222}{39350}I want to stay, but three|generations of Democratic ancestors
{39350}{39401}are screaming out in protest.
{39401}{39470}That's a lot of generations.
{39953}{39985}I hope it's good.
{39985}{40014}We're struggling here.
{40014}{40045}Potentially good.
{40045}{40122}They found gunshot|residue on Josh's jacket.
{40122}{40154}His... where are you?
{40154}{40186}Police station.
{40186}{40238}Listen, they found|something else on it, too...
{40238}{40268}Heather's blood.
{40268}{40334}They're interrogating Josh now.
{40334}{40381}Okay, I'll have to get a continuance.
{40381}{40438}You may not have to. The|cops are all over this.
{40438}{40497}Look, I'm outside the interrogation room.
{40497}{40535}Phone me when you get something.
{40535}{40589}I'll call the troops,|we'll line up the witnesses.
{40589}{40627}A different ballistics expert.
{40627}{40672}Ahead of you.
{40895}{40932}What?
{40969}{41017}Malt ball?
{41036}{41102}What happened, Burton?
{41102}{41133}Mmm.
{41209}{41269}Well, he did burglarize those dorm rooms.
{41269}{41317}He was actually in league with Heather.
{41317}{41362}They were planning to Rob your client.
{41362}{41388}Makes sense.
{41388}{41436}Trying to kill his cohort in crime.
{41436}{41536}And the lab confirms that is GSR|on the jacket and Heather's blood.
{41536}{41596}Okay...
{41596}{41677}I'm not seeing how this is bad yet.
{41677}{41725}Well, it's not... for me.
{41725}{41820}The blood and the GSR were on|the inside lining of the jacket.
{41820}{41867}So he wrapped it around his shooting hand.
{41867}{41929}Josh said the jacket was|on the floor of the bedroom.
{41929}{41981}He heard the shot, got into the room,
{41981}{42044}grabbed the jacket from|between Bianca and Heather,
{42044}{42096}put it on and wore it home.
{42096}{42126}Because he's guilty.
{42126}{42191}Yes... of burglary.
{42234}{42290}I'm not an advocate here, Kalinda.
{42290}{42365}I don't lie to make|things better for a client.
{42365}{42406}I just look at the facts.
{42406}{42465}And the facts are against you.
{42465}{42538}Right.
{42886}{42922}Oh.
{42922}{42952}Yeah.
{42952}{43009}Oh, sorry, Alicia. It's late, I know.
{43030}{43086}No, no, no, no, I'm up.
{43086}{43150}Look, we ran into a|problem with the narrative.
{43150}{43209}I think we may need to|put Bianca on the stand.
{43209}{43286}I thought Kalinda had something.
{43286}{43324}It didn't pan out.
{43324}{43377}Do you think you'll be able|to handle questioning her?
{43377}{43407}Yes.
{43562}{43626}We're in a weird place, I know.
{43668}{43706}It's okay.
{43706}{43821}No. I don't like being in a weird place.
{43886}{43940}I know.
{43940}{44001}Me neither.
{44028}{44077}When I look at you during the day,
{44077}{44142}I want to know what you're thinking.
{44337}{44407}Sometimes I don't even|know what I'm thinking.
{44407}{44490}Will...
{44490}{44537}Yeah?
{44537}{44606}If it had been differently...
{44638}{44748}at Georgetown, if... if it|had been us and not Peter,
{44748}{44804}we would have lasted a week.
{44804}{44840}No, we wouldn't have.
{44840}{44875}We would have.
{44875}{44971}It's romantic because it didn't happen.
{44971}{45092}If it had happened, it would have just...
{45092}{45144}Been life.
{45214}{45286}Will don't say that, please.
{45505}{45536}I don't understand.
{45536}{45602}Nice 9mm autoshot six.
{45602}{45661}They don't make them anymore|'cause they have a hair trigger.
{45661}{45708}The slightest pressure|fires the mechanism.
{45708}{45738}An accidental firing?
{45738}{45794}Yeah, but not the one that you'd expect.
{45811}{45849}The prosecution was correct.
{45849}{45910}The shot came from three feet away.
{45910}{46018}The weapon was in the drawer|of your client's bureau.
{46018}{46084}Heather was a thief, and when|Bianca was in the bathroom,
{46084}{46151}Heather checked the drawer|for valuables, money.
{46151}{46193}Oh, my God.
{46193}{46246}She checked the drawer with the weapon...
{46280}{46402}Reached in to take it, and...
{46435}{46460}You're kidding.
{46460}{46545}The shot was fired from three feet|away, but vertically, not horizontally.
{46545}{46604}And it was accidentally fired by Heather.
{46604}{46638}There's no service in here.
{46638}{46709}And once it was fired,|the gun fell to the floor.
{46709}{46832}The problem was there was no blood|or gunshot residue below the impact.
{46809}{46855}That's why I didn't see it.
{46855}{46901}- He took his jacket.|- That's right.
{46901}{46955}Mr. Mundy took his leather jacket
{46955}{47048}from the floor, and that had|the blood and the GSR on it.
{47048}{47079}You'll testify to this?
{47079}{47128}Of course. Usual fee.
{47128}{47195}The problem is, it's not a good story.
{47195}{47265}It's just a freak accident.|There are no villains.
{47265}{47294}But if it's true...
{47294}{47348}But it doesn't sound true.
{47348}{47392}The prosecution's story|sounds like the truth...
{47392}{47457}there's a villain: Bianca,|there's a motive: jealousy.
{47457}{47503}This story just says|there's no rhyme or reason.
{47503}{47536}Everything's random.
{47536}{47573}Well, we're not trying to teach a lesson.
{47573}{47618}- Just win a verdict.|- There's another problem.
{47618}{47668}We've already set our|story that Josh did it.
{47668}{47721}Even our own ballistics|expert supported that.
{47721}{47779}Right. We'd have to contradict|our own ballistics expert.
{47779}{47847}Well, there's an another|way to settle this:
{47847}{47875}Ask the client.
{47979}{48031}So that's what happened?
{48031}{48091}That's what our ballistics|expert said happened.
{48091}{48152}So, I don't know. Do we put|this new evidence on the stand
{48152}{48199}or not? Which is smarter?
{48199}{48234}Well, that's up for discussion.
{48234}{48331}Our worry is we tried|one defense with the jury,
{48331}{48401}and now if we try another,|we might do two things:
{48401}{48436}Undercut our credibility|and hurt our chances
{48436}{48511}if the jury was believing our|first defense, that Josh did it.
{48511}{48555}So what should I do?
{48615}{48651}You go with the truth.
{48651}{48725}The truth has the advantage of|being true, and on some level,
{48725}{48787}the truth is always more believable.
{48787}{48869}Then that's what we go with, the truth.
{48869}{48931}And you believe the|gunshot was self-inflicted?
{48931}{48974}Well, I don't believe.
{48974}{49012}The science points there.
{49012}{49080}The gunshot was|accidentally self-inflicted.
{49080}{49109}Thank you, Mr. McVeigh.
{49109}{49131}No problem.
{49131}{49268}As you said, Mr. McVeigh, you originally|didn't want to testify in this case?
{49268}{49345}- Yes. I thought Miss Price was guilty.|- Right.
{49345}{49421}Then two days ago you had an epiphany?
{49421}{49506}Well, if by epiphany you mean|a new piece of evidence...
{49506}{49561}this jacket with bloodstain and GSR...
{49561}{49598}then yes, I did have that.
{49598}{49630}A change of heart?
{49630}{49706}Not my choice of words,|but I won't object to 'em.
{49754}{49860}You're staying at the Westin|while you testify in another case?
{49860}{49895}Yes.
{49895}{49977}This is a hotel where many|prosecutors house their witnesses?
{49977}{50016}Yes, I believe that's true.
{50016}{50070}It's a hotel where several|prosecutors observed you
{50070}{50096}meeting with another lawyer.
{50096}{50145}Is that a question?
{50145}{50170}No.
{50170}{50228}Here's the question:
{50228}{50308}Two nights ago before you|magically changed your mind
{50308}{50360}about this case, did you|have dinner with a partner
{50360}{50436}from the law firm,|Stern, Lockhart & Gardner?
{50436}{50463}- Yes.|- Objection!
{50463}{50508}The question's been answered, Mr. Gardner.
{50508}{50559}Yes, Your Honor, I'm sorry,|but it was answered too quickly.
{50559}{50617}Well let me overrule just as quickly.
{50617}{50730}And after this dinner,|the partner in question,
{50730}{50825}Diane Lockhart, joined|you in your hotel room?
{50825}{50891}Yes.
{50920}{50980}And did you have sexual relations?
{50980}{51016}Objection, Your Honor!|How is this relevant?
{51016}{51077}Well, I would imagine|that Mr. Brody would say
{51077}{51156}that the witness's testimony|was bought these alleged
{51156}{51213}sexual relations, isn't|that correct, Mr. Brody?
{51213}{51238}It is, Your Honor.
{51238}{51291}Well, Mr. Brody, I will sustain.
{51291}{51379}Mr. Gardner's objections, but|I don't think you'll mind much
{51379}{51451}because you just threw a stink|bomb into the lap of the jury,
{51451}{51503}and now you're running for cover.
{51503}{51545}Your Honor, this is an instance...
{51545}{51624}And, Mr. Gardner, yes, I|see the outrage on your face,
{51624}{51691}which I might be more|moved by if you hadn't done
{51691}{51749}the exact same thing with|Detective Burton's testimony.
{51749}{51833}- Excuse me, Your Honor, with all dues respect...|- Please, Your Honor...
{51833}{51862}No, no, no.
{51862}{51931}This one we're calling a draw, gentlemen.
{51931}{52005}You have both been playing fast and loose
{52005}{52065}with implications, not|facts, so we're gonna
{52065}{52126}try and let justice take care of itself.
{52141}{52209}- You have any more questions, Mr. Brody?|- No, Your Honor,
{52209}{52256}but we do request a limiting instruction.
{52256}{52322}Members of the jury, in weighing.
{52322}{52405}Mr. McVeigh's testimony, you|may consider any potential bias
{52405}{52538}in assessing the weight you want|to give to what he had to say.
{52592}{52675}You know, I think it's almost medieval.
{52675}{52724}They toss us in here, they lock the door,
{52724}{52790}they throw a lot of|contradictory evidence at us,
{52790}{52839}and then they expect us to|come up with a fair decision.
{52839}{52880}I mean, come on.
{52901}{52966}So...
{53004}{53062}Shall we take another vote?
{53062}{53098}I am finished with this|conversation. You're in my office.
{53098}{53145}You don't have the courtesy...
{53145}{53180}You don't understand|what you did to this firm.
{53180}{53202}Okay, I'm getting out of here.
{53202}{53232}Did it even occur to you to tell me?
{53232}{53282}No, it didn't. I was under|the mistaken impression
{53282}{53324}- that it was my life.|- It's your life
{53324}{53365}when it doesn't impact our clients.
{53365}{53413}It didn't impact our clients.
{53413}{53442}Diane, the jury ate it up.
{53442}{53551}It was sex. It wasn't GSR|or ballistics, it was sex.
{53551}{53581}I'm going home.
{53581}{53604}If you had just told me.
{53604}{53635}If you had just given me a sign!
{53635}{53693}- Come on.|- Come on.
{53693}{53748}Don't be a hypocrite.
{53748}{53805}A hypocrite? How am I a hypocrite?
{53852}{53883}Alicia.
{54008}{54138}That's supposed to what,|make me quake, make me humble?
{54138}{54167}Make you honest.
{54167}{54214}There's nothing going on with Alicia.
{54214}{54246}That's not true.
{54246}{54273}It is true.
{54273}{54323}Will... I have two eyes.
{54323}{54359}Then use them.
{54359}{54385}Watch me.
{54385}{54435}Watch us.
{54435}{54491}There's nothing going on with Alicia.
{54611}{54660}Turn out the lights.
{55104}{55164}Prosecution's come in|with a last-minute offer:
{55164}{55203}second-degree murder, ten years.
{55203}{55235}We don't have a lot of time.
{55235}{55322}When the verdict comes|in, the offer goes away.
{55322}{55361}You'd be 34 years old, baby.
{55361}{55387}You'd still...
{55387}{55456}you'd still have a life.
{55456}{55498}But if they find you guilty...
{55498}{55555}45 years, no parole.
{55606}{55642}2055. I... I...
{55642}{55679}What do you think?
{55822}{55865}I think you didn't do it...
{55865}{55897}and the jury will see that.
{55897}{55942}Really?
{55942}{55967}Yes.
{55967}{56021}You only need one juror.
{56064}{56185}Yes, but if you're wrong, you'll go|back to work, and I watch my daught...
{56185}{56245}Oh, my God, I can't do this.
{56285}{56335}I know.
{56335}{56389}Can you give us a minute?
{56675}{56707}Mom...
{56707}{56759}It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay.
{56880}{56944}Listen, listen, they were|just arguing the opposite!
{56944}{56970}Which they're allowed to.
{56970}{57021}They're the defense.
{57021}{57063}But two ballistic experts,|one saying one thing,
{57063}{57099}- the other saying...|- They're the defense.
{57099}{57190}The whole point is to poke|holes in the prosecution's case.
{57190}{57237}Yes, but this ballistics expert said
{57237}{57274}two days ago he thought one thing,
{57274}{57301}now he's thinking another...
{57301}{57348}Right! And what if in three days more
{57348}{57398}he thinks something else?
{57509}{57600}Hey, doc, you look depleted.
{57600}{57661}I guess I am.
{57661}{57687}I don't know.
{57687}{57769}I sit here listening to everybody talk,
{57769}{57865}and I just feel like we weren't|given enough information.
{57962}{58057}So what do we do?
{58097}{58197}Do you have reasonable doubt?
{58242}{58301}I don't know.
{58301}{58364}I just have...
{58364}{58414}Reasonable ignorance.
{58772}{58818}Kalinda, we've got a problem.
{58818}{58872}The bailiff's warning that|the verdict's coming in.
{58872}{58897}Okay.
{58897}{58945}Bianca and her mother want to talk to us.
{58945}{58969}Oh, no.
{58969}{58999}Yep. Where's Cary? We need Cary.
{58999}{59022}Why?
{59022}{59069}She likes him. Maybe he can talk to her.
{59069}{59105}Okay.
{59178}{59242}Okay...
{59242}{59265}We're unanimous.
{59265}{59293}- Oh!|- Yes!
{59293}{59355}Finally. Good job.
{59355}{59394}Democracy in action.
{59394}{59446}All for $15 a day.
{59446}{59501}I bet a lot of jurors|trade numbers and say
{59501}{59576}they'll stay in touch,|but I bet nobody does.
{59576}{59648}Why don't we just save|time and not trade numbers?
{59648}{59674}Hello. Hi.
{59674}{59707}Hello, Judge.
{59707}{59758}I thought I'd just join you in here
{59758}{59800}and thank you for your service.
{59800}{59888}Unfortunately, I now need to excuse you
{59888}{59927}and thank you for your service.
{59927}{59998}- What did we do?|- Nothing.
{59998}{60055}You did your job well.
{60055}{60136}This happens sometimes, and|there's no way to prepare for it.
{60136}{60241}The prosecution and defense have agreed|to a plea bargain just seconds ago.
{60241}{60274}You're kidding me?
{60274}{60299}No, I'm sorry, I'm not.
{60299}{60429}This happens sometimes when one side|or the other worries about the outcome.
{60429}{60484}So again, thank you.
{60484}{60592}I hope this doesn't diminish your|enthusiasm for the court system
{60592}{60677}because in another year you're|gonna get another summons.
{60809}{60856}So what happened?
{60856}{60900}What was the plea bargain?
{60900}{61005}Oh. Miss Price agreed to a|charge of second-degree murder.
{61005}{61085}Ten years.
{61085}{61132}Thanks again.
