1
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:06,824
_

2
00:00:08,155 --> 00:00:12,367
_

3
00:00:13,883 --> 00:00:21,165
_

4
00:00:21,195 --> 00:00:26,459
_

5
00:00:26,489 --> 00:00:28,818
_

6
00:00:28,848 --> 00:00:35,332
_

7
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:38,584
But we can also always keep
track of what you need...

8
00:00:38,586 --> 00:00:40,019
a heart or a liver.

9
00:00:40,021 --> 00:00:41,384
You can extract them intact?

10
00:00:41,414 --> 00:00:43,748
Yes. We know where not to grab.

11
00:00:43,778 --> 00:00:46,584
Then we don't squash the
part of the specimen you need.

12
00:00:46,614 --> 00:00:48,995
And you can change its position?

13
00:00:48,997 --> 00:00:52,176
If we need to. Again, ultrasound helps.

14
00:00:52,206 --> 00:00:56,235
With the added dilation, we
can change it to a breach.

15
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:58,710
- So?
- So?

16
00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:00,540
So you have to tell me
what you're thinking.

17
00:01:00,542 --> 00:01:02,782
- I can't guess.
- I think you can.

18
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:05,068
Well, you're against abortion,
so my guess is you're repul...

19
00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:07,019
I'm a human being. And yes, I am appalled

20
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:08,513
by a doctor calmly eating yogurt

21
00:01:08,543 --> 00:01:09,591
while talking about selling...

22
00:01:09,621 --> 00:01:11,828
- No, not selling.
- $100 a specimen.

23
00:01:11,858 --> 00:01:13,886
To preserve, package and deliver.

24
00:01:13,888 --> 00:01:15,692
- That is legal.
- Oh, God, do you hear yourself?

25
00:01:15,722 --> 00:01:16,833
Parts of babies.

26
00:01:16,863 --> 00:01:19,403
Preserving, packaging and
delivering parts of babies.

27
00:01:19,433 --> 00:01:21,360
- Parts of fetuses.
- So you think there's

28
00:01:21,362 --> 00:01:23,555
anything wrong with that video?

29
00:01:23,585 --> 00:01:25,464
I think it's shop talk.

30
00:01:25,466 --> 00:01:28,001
I think if you listen to any two doctors...

31
00:01:28,031 --> 00:01:29,368
- Or abortionists.
- Talking over

32
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:31,704
drinks or yogurt

33
00:01:31,867 --> 00:01:34,495
about an appendix removal,
it would sound just as bad.

34
00:01:34,525 --> 00:01:37,376
- So you know it's bad?
- No, I know it's an effective

35
00:01:37,378 --> 00:01:39,035
piece of propaganda. That's all.

36
00:01:39,065 --> 00:01:40,105
And why is it so effective?

37
00:01:40,135 --> 00:01:42,053
Because the majority of Americans

38
00:01:42,083 --> 00:01:44,984
only support abortion if they
don't have to face the fact

39
00:01:44,986 --> 00:01:46,719
of it, if they don't have to hear the talk

40
00:01:46,721 --> 00:01:48,387
- about where to squash...
- The majority

41
00:01:48,389 --> 00:01:50,623
of Americans only support anything

42
00:01:50,625 --> 00:01:52,658
if they don't have to face the fact of it.

43
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:54,175
How the hamburger ended up on their plate.

44
00:01:54,205 --> 00:01:56,395
Except this has a face.

45
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,164
It's not an appendix.

46
00:01:58,633 --> 00:01:59,966
It's a human being.

47
00:02:00,951 --> 00:02:02,707
Well, that's the difference between us.

48
00:02:03,084 --> 00:02:04,174
I don't believe it.

49
00:02:04,204 --> 00:02:06,459
- How did you even get it?
- The video?

50
00:02:06,489 --> 00:02:08,288
- Citizens for Ethical Medicine.
- Oh, God.

51
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:10,176
That radical anti-abortion group?

52
00:02:10,178 --> 00:02:12,086
It's not radical. Why is something radical

53
00:02:12,116 --> 00:02:14,060
- merely because you disagree with it?
- What, they pretended to be

54
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:16,843
a bioengineering firm needing human tissue?

55
00:02:16,873 --> 00:02:18,602
- Aborted fetal organs.
- And, what...

56
00:02:18,632 --> 00:02:19,924
you're-you're planning
to do what with that?

57
00:02:19,954 --> 00:02:21,009
- Sue.
- Who?

58
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:23,875
- Her. Her organization.
- For what?

59
00:02:23,905 --> 00:02:26,182
- Well, that's where you come in.
- No.

60
00:02:26,212 --> 00:02:28,564
- It's not about you being a lawyer.
- Oh, really?

61
00:02:28,594 --> 00:02:29,942
- Thank you.
- It's about you telling me

62
00:02:29,972 --> 00:02:32,132
- how Mr. Dipple can sue.
- Well, he can grow a uterus.

63
00:02:32,895 --> 00:02:33,917
You don't have standing.

64
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:35,151
What are you gonna sue for?

65
00:02:35,153 --> 00:02:36,352
- Selling of fetuses.
- No.

66
00:02:36,354 --> 00:02:38,204
What, $100? That's nothing.

67
00:02:39,394 --> 00:02:42,641
The repositioning of
fetuses for a breech birth?

68
00:02:43,702 --> 00:02:46,012
- That's it.
- No.

69
00:02:46,042 --> 00:02:47,345
Right?

70
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:50,025
You need a woman who had an abortion there,

71
00:02:50,174 --> 00:02:52,566
a woman who was lied
to about the procedures,

72
00:02:52,596 --> 00:02:55,033
and a woman who suffered
measurable harm as a result.

73
00:02:55,063 --> 00:02:57,626
- Those are the three criteria?
- Yes.

74
00:02:59,232 --> 00:03:00,998
You have someone?

75
00:03:01,028 --> 00:03:02,516
You tell me.

76
00:03:02,546 --> 00:03:04,080
Stacy Groom. 27 years old.

77
00:03:04,082 --> 00:03:05,981
Had an abortion, regretted it.

78
00:03:06,011 --> 00:03:08,955
She fulfills all three criteria.

79
00:03:08,985 --> 00:03:10,840
I'm not asking you to take her case.

80
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:12,088
I won't take her case.

81
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:14,435
I'm asking you to cross-examine her.

82
00:03:14,465 --> 00:03:17,388
Do your worst. See if
she's ready for court.

83
00:03:24,215 --> 00:03:26,903
Mr. Crouse. Can you start today?

84
00:03:26,905 --> 00:03:28,514
Sure. What do you need?

85
00:03:28,544 --> 00:03:31,574
Information on this woman.

86
00:03:32,372 --> 00:03:33,576
She regrets an abortion

87
00:03:33,578 --> 00:03:35,878
and is suing the abortion clinic.

88
00:03:36,762 --> 00:03:38,462
What's the cap on hours?

89
00:03:38,926 --> 00:03:39,966
Cap?

90
00:03:39,968 --> 00:03:42,702
Whenever the work is done, it's done.

91
00:03:43,518 --> 00:03:45,314
I'm on my way.

92
00:03:49,676 --> 00:03:50,877
The bills are piling up

93
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,183
and we do not have enough revenue

94
00:03:52,213 --> 00:03:54,653
coming in to pay our bills,

95
00:03:54,683 --> 00:03:56,616
so we need to compensate.

96
00:03:56,947 --> 00:03:59,424
We can't keep living DUI to DUI.

97
00:03:59,454 --> 00:04:01,521
- I'm open to suggestions.
- Well, for one thing,

98
00:04:01,523 --> 00:04:03,345
we need to ration. We're spending too much

99
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:04,690
on investigator hours.

100
00:04:04,692 --> 00:04:06,336
- Should I leave?
- No.

101
00:04:06,366 --> 00:04:08,361
Look, we still need to be effective.

102
00:04:08,363 --> 00:04:10,698
We can't ration our way to success.

103
00:04:10,728 --> 00:04:13,448
- Then what?
- We cancel our Westlaw subscription

104
00:04:13,478 --> 00:04:16,816
and we double our efforts
to bring in new clients.

105
00:04:16,846 --> 00:04:19,069
- We eat what we kill.
- What does that mean?

106
00:04:19,099 --> 00:04:21,541
It means that Lucca and
I both get two-thirds

107
00:04:21,543 --> 00:04:23,948
of whatever business we
bring in. No more 50-50.

108
00:04:23,978 --> 00:04:25,878
It'll make us hungrier, work harder.

109
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,414
- If you want it, I want it.
- I want it.

110
00:04:28,653 --> 00:04:30,149
Where you going?

111
00:04:30,404 --> 00:04:31,817
Business lunch.

112
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:37,423
Thank you for agreeing to meet.

113
00:04:37,862 --> 00:04:39,425
What do you need?

114
00:04:42,345 --> 00:04:44,046
I'm a fan.

115
00:04:44,048 --> 00:04:45,803
Uh, here, have some wine.

116
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:47,532
I... I-I'd pour it, but it'd...

117
00:04:47,534 --> 00:04:49,907
- get all over the place.
- How exactly are you a fan?

118
00:04:49,937 --> 00:04:51,337
The T-Port case.

119
00:04:51,339 --> 00:04:53,039
You're scrappy, you're aggressive.

120
00:04:53,275 --> 00:04:54,440
You deserve better.

121
00:04:54,442 --> 00:04:56,119
- What's better?
- $90,000 a year.

122
00:04:56,149 --> 00:04:58,176
Another 30 guaranteed as bonus.

123
00:04:58,206 --> 00:05:00,618
Plus ten percent of whatever
business you bring in.

124
00:05:00,648 --> 00:05:02,088
No, thanks.

125
00:05:02,463 --> 00:05:03,898
You're four years out of law school, Lucca.

126
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:05,625
You don't have that much room to negotiate.

127
00:05:05,655 --> 00:05:07,041
Oh, I'm not negotiating.

128
00:05:07,071 --> 00:05:10,345
I just don't want to be bait.

129
00:05:10,794 --> 00:05:13,302
You're trying to lure Alicia, right?

130
00:05:13,332 --> 00:05:15,832
So, either make it clear why you want me

131
00:05:16,665 --> 00:05:18,115
or save your money.

132
00:05:20,137 --> 00:05:21,784
Hey, Mom?

133
00:05:22,202 --> 00:05:23,419
I want to help.

134
00:05:23,421 --> 00:05:24,783
Don't worry, we'll be fine.

135
00:05:24,813 --> 00:05:27,857
No, mom, let me help. What can I do?

136
00:05:28,843 --> 00:05:30,726
Okay.

137
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:32,795
Cold call.

138
00:05:32,825 --> 00:05:33,921
Go through the phone book.

139
00:05:33,951 --> 00:05:35,231
Call businesses, one after another.

140
00:05:35,233 --> 00:05:37,171
See if they need legal representation.

141
00:05:37,201 --> 00:05:38,269
Where would I start?

142
00:05:38,299 --> 00:05:40,684
Mid-level insurance firms.

143
00:05:40,714 --> 00:05:42,416
And maybe real estate.

144
00:05:42,446 --> 00:05:43,610
How do I know it's mid-level?

145
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,541
Look at the size of the
ad, see how big it is.

146
00:05:45,543 --> 00:05:48,543
Okay. And do I get a
percentage if I find anyone?

147
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:50,479
I thought this was to help.

148
00:05:50,481 --> 00:05:53,231
It is. But do I get a percentage?

149
00:05:55,891 --> 00:05:57,409
Okay. I will give you

150
00:05:57,439 --> 00:05:59,581
half a percentage point for any booking.

151
00:05:59,611 --> 00:06:02,546
One percentage point would
be even more of an incentive.

152
00:06:02,576 --> 00:06:04,493
You're right.

153
00:06:04,862 --> 00:06:06,111
But what I'm offering

154
00:06:06,113 --> 00:06:07,563
is half a percentage point.

155
00:06:07,593 --> 00:06:11,837
Stacy Groom. I work as a copy
editor at Myrtle Publishing.

156
00:06:11,867 --> 00:06:14,753
Did the 8th Street clinic
perform an abortion on you?

157
00:06:14,755 --> 00:06:17,081
They did. Ten months ago.

158
00:06:17,111 --> 00:06:19,564
And did Dr. Hallie Fisher
perform that abortion?

159
00:06:19,594 --> 00:06:21,449
- The woman on the video?
- Yes.

160
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:24,333
Did she accurately represent
the procedure to you?

161
00:06:24,363 --> 00:06:27,438
No. She tricked me into
donating fetal tissue.

162
00:06:27,468 --> 00:06:29,335
She never told me it would be sold.

163
00:06:29,337 --> 00:06:31,537
She even...

164
00:06:31,776 --> 00:06:34,597
flipped the baby into a
breech position to help

165
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:37,276
- better harvest the organs.
- And what, if any,

166
00:06:37,278 --> 00:06:39,850
damages did you suffer as a result?

167
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,615
Well, I, um...

168
00:06:42,617 --> 00:06:43,983
I cry all the time now.

169
00:06:43,985 --> 00:06:46,507
I can't eat. I can barely sleep.

170
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,187
It's, uh,

171
00:06:48,189 --> 00:06:50,733
hard to get to work every day.

172
00:06:50,763 --> 00:06:52,725
My work has suffered.

173
00:06:52,727 --> 00:06:54,123
Are we boring you, Diane?

174
00:06:54,153 --> 00:06:55,833
No, quite scintillating.

175
00:06:57,598 --> 00:06:59,832
- Anything?
- You tell me.

176
00:07:06,506 --> 00:07:08,837
Why don't you work for us full-time?

177
00:07:08,867 --> 00:07:10,743
I like keeping my options open.

178
00:07:10,745 --> 00:07:12,211
We need a dedicated investigator.

179
00:07:12,213 --> 00:07:13,344
You could make more money.

180
00:07:13,374 --> 00:07:15,182
Money's not everything.

181
00:07:15,212 --> 00:07:17,683
Yes, but sometimes it's something.

182
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:19,685
I'm good.

183
00:07:20,969 --> 00:07:23,489
I may need more of this.

184
00:07:24,264 --> 00:07:25,573
Call me.

185
00:07:25,603 --> 00:07:28,961
You said that Dr. Fisher
tricked you into donating tissue,

186
00:07:28,963 --> 00:07:31,497
but isn't that your signature
there on the release form?

187
00:07:31,499 --> 00:07:32,898
It is. So?

188
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,167
So were you under the influence

189
00:07:35,169 --> 00:07:38,274
of anesthesia or some other
drug when you signed this?

190
00:07:38,304 --> 00:07:41,340
- No.
- So how did she trick you?

191
00:07:41,815 --> 00:07:44,341
Well, she said it was for
medical research purposes.

192
00:07:44,371 --> 00:07:45,244
Not to make money.

193
00:07:45,246 --> 00:07:47,847
Uh-huh. And how do you
know it was to make money?

194
00:07:47,849 --> 00:07:50,950
I saw it on the video. And is
that when you started experiencing

195
00:07:50,952 --> 00:07:54,959
these symptoms... the symptoms
that kept you from work...

196
00:07:54,989 --> 00:07:57,022
right around the time you saw this video?

197
00:07:57,024 --> 00:07:58,624
- I guess.
- So the procedure

198
00:07:58,626 --> 00:07:59,727
was ten months ago,

199
00:07:59,757 --> 00:08:02,254
and you've been experiencing these symptoms

200
00:08:02,284 --> 00:08:04,296
for one week?

201
00:08:04,298 --> 00:08:05,697
- Two.
- Any chance you

202
00:08:05,727 --> 00:08:08,546
went to a doctor and got a
diagnosis in those two weeks?

203
00:08:08,576 --> 00:08:10,269
- I haven't had time.
- But you have

204
00:08:10,271 --> 00:08:12,969
had time to go to the
Church of God in Christ

205
00:08:12,999 --> 00:08:16,608
eight times since you
joined... two weeks ago.

206
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:18,386
Uh, what do you mean by "join"?

207
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:21,239
Well, did you accept
the Lord as your savior

208
00:08:21,269 --> 00:08:23,628
two weeks ago during an altar call

209
00:08:23,658 --> 00:08:26,191
at the Church of God in Christ?

210
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:29,588
- Is that illegal?
- No, not at all.

211
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:31,991
But two months ago, did you give this

212
00:08:31,993 --> 00:08:34,118
anonymous quote to the Tribune?

213
00:08:34,148 --> 00:08:37,062
"Choice is under attack
by right-wing forces

214
00:08:37,064 --> 00:08:38,805
in this country."

215
00:08:38,835 --> 00:08:40,098
So?

216
00:08:40,128 --> 00:08:43,569
So it seems like you tend to
go from one extreme to another.

217
00:08:43,571 --> 00:08:45,637
How did you get that quote?

218
00:08:46,011 --> 00:08:47,740
It's why you pay us.

219
00:08:49,313 --> 00:08:50,521
So what are you gonna do...

220
00:08:50,551 --> 00:08:51,623
bring the case or not?

221
00:08:51,653 --> 00:08:53,379
- Not.
- Really?

222
00:08:53,381 --> 00:08:54,666
You made your point.

223
00:08:54,696 --> 00:08:57,282
Wouldn't it be odd if the
person who respected you the most

224
00:08:57,284 --> 00:08:59,816
was the person you agreed with the least?

225
00:08:59,846 --> 00:09:02,579
- That would be odd.
- I'm putting those undercover tapes online

226
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:05,991
and seeing if anybody takes it seriously.

227
00:09:06,734 --> 00:09:08,547
Well, that was easy.

228
00:09:09,098 --> 00:09:11,726

Hey, Grace, what's up?

233
00:09:46,299 --> 00:09:48,600
No, I don't know anyone
in need. Why do you ask?

234
00:09:48,602 --> 00:09:50,394
Are things that bad over there?

235
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:51,970
Oh, Grace, hold on a minute.

236
00:09:51,972 --> 00:09:54,106
But I'm the one who just wrote a check.

237
00:09:54,108 --> 00:09:56,975
Grace, I got to go. I'll
call you if I think of anyone.

238
00:09:57,573 --> 00:10:00,112
Uh, Ms. Paige. Hello.

239
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:03,148
Mr. Gold. Hi.

240
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:04,783
I was wondering if I'd see you.

241
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,281
Eli, please.

242
00:10:06,311 --> 00:10:08,821
Do you have a minute? There's
something I'd like to...

243
00:10:09,053 --> 00:10:12,958
you know, say or-or discuss.

244
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,226
Uh, th-this is temporary.

245
00:10:19,256 --> 00:10:22,452
Mm. It's fine. Very... cozy.

246
00:10:22,482 --> 00:10:24,436
Um...

247
00:10:24,438 --> 00:10:26,638
Oh, thank you.

248
00:10:30,944 --> 00:10:32,573
Actually, I'm sorry, I
have to... Could I just...

249
00:10:32,603 --> 00:10:34,140
Oh, sorry.

250
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:40,157
Excuse me.

251
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,248
I have something to discuss.

252
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:48,282
Have I done something wrong?

253
00:10:48,312 --> 00:10:50,008
No, no, no... What do you mean?

254
00:10:50,038 --> 00:10:51,747
Well, you sound serious.

255
00:10:51,749 --> 00:10:53,504
Oh, well, that's just

256
00:10:53,534 --> 00:10:54,650
who I am.

257
00:10:55,115 --> 00:10:56,018
I'm working on that.

258
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:58,420
I... I told a joke yesterday.

259
00:10:58,422 --> 00:10:59,636
What was it?

260
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:01,762
Um, how do you...

261
00:11:01,792 --> 00:11:03,215
No, wh...

262
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:04,560
No, I forgot.

263
00:11:04,562 --> 00:11:06,050
It'll come back.

264
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,846
It-It's about your business.

265
00:11:07,848 --> 00:11:10,382
And-and actually, it is a bit serious.

266
00:11:10,384 --> 00:11:13,591
I think I know what it's
about. The salary floor?

267
00:11:13,621 --> 00:11:14,792
Yes.

268
00:11:14,822 --> 00:11:17,189
- It's communism, right?
- No.

269
00:11:17,191 --> 00:11:20,826
- Socialism?
- No. Well... y-yes, it is a bit.

270
00:11:20,828 --> 00:11:22,628
I like my employees. They work hard.

271
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:24,663
So I decided to give them all a raise.

272
00:11:24,665 --> 00:11:26,958
To $75,000 for everybody?

273
00:11:26,988 --> 00:11:27,783
Yeah.

274
00:11:27,785 --> 00:11:29,251
It's my money.

275
00:11:29,587 --> 00:11:30,502
Why is that bad?

276
00:11:30,532 --> 00:11:32,836
Oh, it's not bad... for your employees,

277
00:11:32,866 --> 00:11:34,771
but... for Peter.

278
00:11:34,801 --> 00:11:38,594
Oh. Ah, he's suddenly
a socialist sympathizer.

279
00:11:38,596 --> 00:11:40,192
All the campaign asks is that you wait

280
00:11:40,222 --> 00:11:43,198
until after the election
before you give your raises.

281
00:11:43,845 --> 00:11:46,098
Oh, so, there are two fish in a tank.

282
00:11:46,128 --> 00:11:48,171
And, um, one fish says

283
00:11:48,201 --> 00:11:52,307
to the other fish, "How
do you drive this thing?"

284
00:11:53,509 --> 00:11:54,843
That was the punch line, because, you know,

285
00:11:54,873 --> 00:11:56,455
we-we think they're in fish tank,

286
00:11:56,485 --> 00:11:59,948
but actually, they're in a... tank tank.

287
00:12:00,832 --> 00:12:02,417
Funny.

288
00:12:04,486 --> 00:12:06,722
So, have-have you thought
of the legal ramifications

289
00:12:06,724 --> 00:12:08,922
of giving everybody $75,000?

290
00:12:08,952 --> 00:12:10,503
Yes, I've discussed it with

291
00:12:10,533 --> 00:12:12,135
my in-house counsel.

292
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:14,997
How about you hear from a second opinion?

293
00:12:17,811 --> 00:12:19,101
I don't want to hear it.

294
00:12:19,103 --> 00:12:21,069
No, I... What do you mean?

295
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,610
You yelling at me about Landau.

296
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,373
What did you do with Landau?!

297
00:12:26,669 --> 00:12:27,845
Wait. Why are you here?

298
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:30,000
Because I have a client.
What happened with Landau?

299
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,218
The election board.

300
00:12:31,248 --> 00:12:32,553
I punted a vote on the machines

301
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:35,009
by ordering a study, and Landau's furious.

302
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:36,618
Because you two had a deal.

303
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:38,606
I knew it!

304
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:40,089
Well, let's just file that one

305
00:12:40,091 --> 00:12:43,166
under ongoing disasters, shall we?

306
00:12:43,884 --> 00:12:47,010
I'm sending you a client who
just happens to be a billionaire.

307
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:47,997
Courtney Paige?

308
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:50,610
Yes. It's probably just
a couple of hours work,

309
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,334
but you can bill what you want.

310
00:12:52,336 --> 00:12:53,735
Thank you.

311
00:12:53,737 --> 00:12:55,170
Yes, that's all I want is-is...

312
00:12:55,172 --> 00:12:56,689
- is your thanks.
- Thank you.

313
00:12:56,719 --> 00:13:00,400
And... I need you to talk Courtney
out of what she wants to do.

314
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:01,810
I know, I know,

315
00:13:01,812 --> 00:13:03,479
you can't promise anything...
that would be unethical...

316
00:13:03,481 --> 00:13:05,047
but she's planning to give everybody

317
00:13:05,049 --> 00:13:08,620
in her company a raise to $75,000 a year.

318
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:09,885
It is in her best interest,

319
00:13:09,887 --> 00:13:12,646
both legally and politically,
not to do so.

320
00:13:12,676 --> 00:13:14,289
Also, it hurts Peter.

321
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:15,358
That's just my opinion.

322
00:13:15,388 --> 00:13:16,664
I'm not telling you how to advise.

323
00:13:16,694 --> 00:13:18,636
You want to encourage
her to chase socialism

324
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:20,015
to the graveyard of history...

325
00:13:20,045 --> 00:13:22,331
be my guest.

326
00:13:28,187 --> 00:13:29,071
Yes?

327
00:13:29,073 --> 00:13:32,508
Dr. Hallie Fisher is suing
to take down the teaser,

328
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:35,344
and block the release
of our undercover video.

329
00:13:36,717 --> 00:13:37,972
And?

330
00:13:38,002 --> 00:13:39,581
And that's bad.

331
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:41,112
Not for you, but for me.

332
00:13:41,142 --> 00:13:42,810
No, it's prior restraint.

333
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,947
No judge will allow it.

334
00:13:44,977 --> 00:13:46,330
Go ahead, just put it online.

335
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:51,193
Judge Margovski already granted
an emergency hearing today.

336
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,793
I know you're no fan of
Citizens for Ethical Medicine,

337
00:13:57,823 --> 00:13:59,404
but this isn't about abortion anymore.

338
00:13:59,434 --> 00:14:01,344
This is about the First Amendment.

339
00:14:02,338 --> 00:14:04,036
Which you're using as a weapon

340
00:14:04,066 --> 00:14:06,468
to attack women and medicine and choice.

341
00:14:06,498 --> 00:14:09,945
"Anyone can defend a sympathetic
client with popular beliefs.

342
00:14:09,947 --> 00:14:12,214
"The real test of the First Amendment

343
00:14:12,589 --> 00:14:14,003
"is whether we are willing to stand up

344
00:14:14,033 --> 00:14:16,251
for people and ideas we hate."

345
00:14:17,167 --> 00:14:18,620
Well, that's more persuasive

346
00:14:18,622 --> 00:14:20,811
and plainspoken than you normally are.

347
00:14:20,841 --> 00:14:22,441
I was quoting you.

348
00:14:22,443 --> 00:14:24,698
You said that in a speech to Emily's List.

349
00:14:24,728 --> 00:14:27,386
You may not agree with our
tapes or how they were made,

350
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:30,466
but prior restraint is just wrong.

351
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:33,299
And you know it.

352
00:14:35,372 --> 00:14:37,499
Why do I have to be so damn convincing?

353

...www.addic7ed.com...

354
00:14:57,784 --> 00:14:59,517
Just remember,

355
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,053
you're representing the Constitution.

356
00:15:03,882 --> 00:15:06,558
Diane, hello. God bless.

357
00:15:06,588 --> 00:15:08,250
I'm Heidi. I shot the video.

358
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,811
- I'm your client.
- Hi.

359
00:15:09,813 --> 00:15:11,589
Stay away from my uterus!

360
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:13,231
We don't want your dirty uterus!

361
00:15:13,233 --> 00:15:15,722
Sorry, Diane. Just ignore her.

362
00:15:15,752 --> 00:15:17,335
You know I'm not pro-life.

363
00:15:17,337 --> 00:15:19,250
Yes, I know technically,

364
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,229
but you're here to show your support.

365
00:15:20,259 --> 00:15:22,122
No, I'm not here to show anything.

366
00:15:22,152 --> 00:15:23,633
Stop killing women!

367
00:15:23,663 --> 00:15:25,613
Stop killing children!

368
00:15:25,957 --> 00:15:29,268
This secret tape is already
causing irreparable damage

369
00:15:29,298 --> 00:15:31,999
to the important work that
Dr. Fisher does, Your Honor.

370
00:15:32,001 --> 00:15:33,467
Stand up, Hallie.

371
00:15:34,707 --> 00:15:35,623
- Yeah!
- No!

372
00:15:35,653 --> 00:15:37,638
No! No! People.

373
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,932
Let's get this clear.

374
00:15:39,962 --> 00:15:41,114
You're guests here.

375
00:15:41,144 --> 00:15:42,136
That's all.

376
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:44,078
No waving of signs, no...

377
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:47,877
In fact, John, let's
collect those signs, okay?

378
00:15:47,907 --> 00:15:49,034
Thank you.

379
00:15:49,064 --> 00:15:50,294
Go ahead, Counselor.

380
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:52,159
When I was growing up in the Bronx,

381
00:15:52,189 --> 00:15:54,205
there was one thing I was always told.

382
00:15:54,207 --> 00:15:56,240
Sneaks can't be rewarded for sneaking.

383
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:58,609
Your Honor, this isn't about sneaks.

384
00:15:58,611 --> 00:16:01,604
This is a textbook case of prior restraint.

385
00:16:01,634 --> 00:16:03,750
If we're against it
with the Pentagon Papers,

386
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:04,949
we should be against it here.

387
00:16:04,951 --> 00:16:06,484
Now that offends me.

388
00:16:06,486 --> 00:16:08,586
I know Danny Ellsberg, and
this woman is nothing like...

389
00:16:08,588 --> 00:16:11,503
Then sue... after the fact.
If you think there is harm,

390
00:16:11,533 --> 00:16:13,337
the proper remedy is a suit for damages.

391
00:16:13,367 --> 00:16:14,859
She's not wrong, Ms. Steel.

392
00:16:14,861 --> 00:16:17,228
The law strongly disfavors
this kind of censorship.

393
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:20,219
Yes, except that this secret
tape was made illegally.

394
00:16:20,249 --> 00:16:22,524
Illinois again requires two-party consent.

395
00:16:22,554 --> 00:16:24,199
Hallie, did you consent to this tape?

396
00:16:24,229 --> 00:16:25,760
- I did not.
- There. One party.

397
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:27,543
Consent wasn't necessary here, Your Honor.

398
00:16:27,573 --> 00:16:29,540
The conversation took place
in a crowded yogurt shop.

399
00:16:29,542 --> 00:16:31,417
There was no reasonable
expectation of privacy.

400
00:16:31,447 --> 00:16:32,952
Of course there was expectation of privacy.

401
00:16:32,982 --> 00:16:34,144
- Your Honor...
- She's alone at a table...

402
00:16:34,174 --> 00:16:35,136
No, no, no.

403
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:36,747
Let's look at the tape

404
00:16:36,749 --> 00:16:39,301
and see if this yogurt shop was crowded.

405
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:40,306
Actually, Your Honor,

406
00:16:40,336 --> 00:16:41,902
I would suggest that the very reason

407
00:16:41,904 --> 00:16:43,437
for this pre-trial motion

408
00:16:43,439 --> 00:16:44,522
would preclude the gallery

409
00:16:44,552 --> 00:16:46,529
from seeing this tape,
this secret tape.

410
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:47,592
You want me to clear the court?

411
00:16:47,594 --> 00:16:48,745
Until you rule on our motion,

412
00:16:48,775 --> 00:16:51,796
Your Honor, this tape should
not see the light of day.

413
00:16:52,352 --> 00:16:54,098
John, let's go.

414
00:16:54,289 --> 00:16:55,866
All right, everybody, I'll ask you

415
00:16:55,868 --> 00:16:58,807
to grab your things, step out.

416
00:16:58,837 --> 00:17:01,606
God bless you, Diane. Thank you.

417
00:17:03,593 --> 00:17:04,866
There was one day where,

418
00:17:04,896 --> 00:17:06,410
as I was working my forceps

419
00:17:06,412 --> 00:17:08,320
into position, trying to get a good grip,

420
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:11,563
I was literally almost
doubled over from cramps.

421
00:17:12,869 --> 00:17:13,918
As you can see, Your Honor...

422
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,721
I think it's pretty clear...
the yogurt shop was crowded,

423
00:17:16,751 --> 00:17:19,353
- and there was no expectation of privacy.
- Wait, wait.

424
00:17:19,383 --> 00:17:21,356
Is that all you need from the tape?

425
00:17:21,386 --> 00:17:23,700
- Yes, Your Honor.
- John, bring them back in.

426
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:25,613
Let's go, everybody in.

427
00:17:25,643 --> 00:17:26,564
Okay, go ahead.

428
00:17:26,566 --> 00:17:28,840
There is no expectation
of privacy, Your Honor.

429
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:30,368
They were three feet from the next table.

430
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:32,070
Which was occupied by children.

431
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,538
- So?
- So, like my mom used to say...

432
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:37,352
stick to the main tent
and avoid the sideshows.

433
00:17:37,382 --> 00:17:39,977
- What does that even mean?
- It means that children do not undermine

434
00:17:39,979 --> 00:17:41,732
the expectation of privacy

435
00:17:41,762 --> 00:17:43,135
because they don't have the capacity

436
00:17:43,165 --> 00:17:44,932
- to understand what it means.
- But their mother

437
00:17:44,934 --> 00:17:46,218
came and joined them at the table,

438
00:17:46,248 --> 00:17:48,903
and Dr. Fisher still carried on
with no expectation of privacy.

439
00:17:48,905 --> 00:17:51,200
- That is not true.
- Look at the tape.

440
00:17:52,767 --> 00:17:54,125
You're kidding.

441
00:17:54,155 --> 00:17:56,143
Sheriff, we need to clear the court.

442
00:17:56,145 --> 00:17:58,772
Come on!

443
00:17:58,802 --> 00:18:00,414
I don't remember when he got divorced.

444
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:03,377
Um, maybe seven, eight years ago. Why?

445
00:18:03,407 --> 00:18:05,680
Oh, just curious.

446
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:08,100
Well, Eli has a daughter. Marissa.

447
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:10,456
He loves her very much. So do I.

448
00:18:10,486 --> 00:18:13,199
He's a good guy... for a political animal.

449
00:18:13,229 --> 00:18:14,628
Well, I know why Eli doesn't want

450
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:18,132
a salary floor, but what
do you think of it, legally?

451
00:18:18,134 --> 00:18:20,267
Well, shareholders may feel devalued,

452
00:18:20,269 --> 00:18:22,626
and clients may feel insulted.

453
00:18:22,656 --> 00:18:24,707
You think they'll sue?

454
00:18:24,737 --> 00:18:25,673
Potentially.

455
00:18:25,675 --> 00:18:27,803
Senior employees may be

456
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:32,813
upset that new hires are making
almost as much from day one.

457
00:18:33,015 --> 00:18:35,849
You might want to offer a sliding scale

458
00:18:36,312 --> 00:18:40,126
where senior employees
get the largest raises.

459
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:42,156
Do you know Matthew 20?

460
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:43,957
Do I...? No.

461
00:18:43,959 --> 00:18:45,592
Um, I'm sure my daughter does.

462
00:18:45,594 --> 00:18:47,027
All the hired hands

463
00:18:47,029 --> 00:18:48,428
are given the same pay.

464
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:50,564
The last who arrived
and the first who worked

465
00:18:50,566 --> 00:18:51,999
in the heat of the day.

466
00:18:52,743 --> 00:18:55,094
- Why?
- Because "The last shall be first

467
00:18:55,124 --> 00:18:57,171
and the first shall be last."

468
00:18:57,173 --> 00:18:59,039
Okay, um, but I do know

469
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:02,743
that Bible stories aren't
usually the best business plans.

470
00:19:02,992 --> 00:19:06,852
Yes, but you know what the bottom line is.

471
00:19:07,037 --> 00:19:08,311
It's your money.

472
00:19:08,341 --> 00:19:10,250
Amen.

473
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:13,091
_

474
00:19:13,121 --> 00:19:16,576
_

475
00:19:16,606 --> 00:19:18,535
_

476
00:19:19,205 --> 00:19:20,460
There. That's the mother.

477
00:19:20,462 --> 00:19:22,622
No kids, no sideshow. Adults.

478
00:19:22,652 --> 00:19:25,999
Yes, but Dr. Fisher was whispering,
which demonstrates her desire

479
00:19:26,001 --> 00:19:27,349
to keep the conversation private.

480
00:19:27,379 --> 00:19:30,104
Oh, come on. It demonstrates
her awareness that she was

481
00:19:30,134 --> 00:19:32,339
in a public place where
she could be overheard.

482
00:19:32,341 --> 00:19:33,979
Wait a minute.

483
00:19:34,534 --> 00:19:36,810
Sheriff, you know what we're missing.

484
00:19:37,098 --> 00:19:40,047
Oh, do I, Your Honor.

485
00:19:40,049 --> 00:19:42,888
We're open for business. Hear ye, hear ye.

486
00:19:42,918 --> 00:19:45,085
So what does whispering mean?

487
00:19:45,115 --> 00:19:47,354
I think it means Ms. Lockhart is right.

488
00:19:47,356 --> 00:19:49,367
The yogurt shop did not afford a reasonable

489
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:51,072
expectation of privacy.

490
00:19:51,102 --> 00:19:53,280
Motion denied. Any other motions?

491
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:54,561
Your Honor, yes.

492
00:19:54,563 --> 00:19:57,264
We ask for a recess to prepare a new one.

493
00:19:57,266 --> 00:19:59,084
Lockhart, Agos & Lee.

494
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:00,719
- Please hold.
- Bea.

495
00:20:00,749 --> 00:20:02,225
I didn't know we had an appointment.

496
00:20:02,255 --> 00:20:03,499
We don't, but we need to talk.

497
00:20:03,529 --> 00:20:05,144
Ms. Wilson, Ethan Carver.

498
00:20:05,174 --> 00:20:06,707
I recognize you from your appearances

499
00:20:06,709 --> 00:20:07,981
for National Council on Women's Rights.

500
00:20:08,011 --> 00:20:09,053
And I recognize you

501
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:11,546
from the congressional hearings
on defunding Planned Parenthood.

502
00:20:11,548 --> 00:20:13,181
Uh, why don't you two wait in the office?

503
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:15,483
- I think that's a good idea.
- Mm.

504
00:20:17,366 --> 00:20:18,451
- How can you do this?
- Bea,

505
00:20:18,481 --> 00:20:20,890
if you're talking about this
case, it's not about choice.

506
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:21,889
It's about the First Amendment.

507
00:20:21,891 --> 00:20:23,856
That's a nice, neat justification.

508
00:20:23,886 --> 00:20:25,164
The pro-choice position isn't

509
00:20:25,194 --> 00:20:26,460
so weak that it can't stand up

510
00:20:26,462 --> 00:20:29,948
- to the marketplace of ideas.
- This isn't about censorship.

511
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:32,841
This is about an orchestrated,
right-wing war on women.

512
00:20:32,871 --> 00:20:35,269
Bea, I will join you in arguing

513
00:20:35,271 --> 00:20:37,847
against the substance of these tapes,

514
00:20:37,877 --> 00:20:39,506
but only after they're made public.

515
00:20:39,508 --> 00:20:41,809
But that's insane. We wouldn't
have to argue against them

516
00:20:41,811 --> 00:20:43,711
if they weren't made public.

517
00:20:46,649 --> 00:20:49,483
Oh. Excuse me.

518
00:20:49,485 --> 00:20:53,284
Hey. I think I know what
they have, the opposition.

519
00:20:54,035 --> 00:20:55,623
What is it?

520
00:20:55,841 --> 00:20:58,397
A non-disclosure agreement.

521
00:20:58,623 --> 00:21:02,329
The Citizens for Ethical
Medicine employees signed a NDA

522
00:21:02,331 --> 00:21:05,032
at the conference before
sitting down with Dr. Fisher,

523
00:21:05,034 --> 00:21:07,067
which expressly prohibits any

524
00:21:07,069 --> 00:21:09,165
recording or dissemination of information.

525
00:21:09,195 --> 00:21:10,572
I see that.

526
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:12,473
This seems pretty ironclad, Diane.

527
00:21:12,475 --> 00:21:14,499
It's a contract of adhesion, Your Honor.

528
00:21:14,529 --> 00:21:16,455
It's an asymmetrical agreement foisted

529
00:21:16,485 --> 00:21:18,479
on someone ill-equipped to
know what she was signing.

530
00:21:18,481 --> 00:21:19,947
"Ill-equipped?" Really?

531
00:21:19,949 --> 00:21:21,749
Three pages of non-optional legalese.

532
00:21:21,751 --> 00:21:24,148
This is no different than the
preposterous user agreements

533
00:21:24,178 --> 00:21:25,391
- we all click "agree" on.
- There's a big difference.

534
00:21:25,421 --> 00:21:27,376
The online agreements don't leave any room

535
00:21:27,406 --> 00:21:30,290
for you to make alterations or amendments.

536
00:21:30,292 --> 00:21:31,725
And, Your Honor, sneaks...

537
00:21:31,727 --> 00:21:33,193
Can't be rewarded for sneaking.

538
00:21:33,195 --> 00:21:35,059
I know that, and I agree.

539
00:21:35,089 --> 00:21:37,698
This non-disclosure agreement holds.

540
00:21:41,524 --> 00:21:44,382
Do you have any other arguments, Diane?

541
00:21:47,858 --> 00:21:50,911
Courtney's ex-husband's suing
her for breach of fiduciary duty.

542
00:21:50,913 --> 00:21:52,718
- What?
- Mm-hmm.

543
00:21:52,748 --> 00:21:54,415
He's still a partner in the company.

544
00:21:54,417 --> 00:21:57,041
I thought her lawyer would know that.

545
00:21:59,045 --> 00:22:01,956
Who are you calling?

546
00:22:01,958 --> 00:22:04,419
Well, she wasn't the
duped, she was the duper.

547
00:22:04,449 --> 00:22:05,734
Your Honor, once again,

548
00:22:05,764 --> 00:22:07,691
this is an overbroad interpretation.

549
00:22:07,721 --> 00:22:08,998
Listen, if she was not willing

550
00:22:09,028 --> 00:22:10,926
to accept the conference's rules...

551
00:22:12,332 --> 00:22:15,074
Alicia, did you find a new client?

552
00:22:15,104 --> 00:22:16,670
Yes and no. Eli referred someone.

553
00:22:16,672 --> 00:22:18,305
Not just someone... a very rich

554
00:22:18,307 --> 00:22:20,669
- and a very powerful someone.
- Shh.

555
00:22:20,699 --> 00:22:23,148
Her husband is part-owner of her company.

556
00:22:23,178 --> 00:22:24,411
I need you to look into him.

557
00:22:24,413 --> 00:22:26,801
- His name...
- Larry Oliver.

558
00:22:27,275 --> 00:22:28,615
Did you get that?

559
00:22:28,877 --> 00:22:30,347
I got it. What am I looking for?

560
00:22:30,377 --> 00:22:32,024
Any weaknesses, vulnerabilities.

561
00:22:32,054 --> 00:22:33,292
Maybe it would help to
know why they divorced.

562
00:22:33,322 --> 00:22:35,229
Jason, do you have a minute?

563
00:22:35,259 --> 00:22:37,254
I need an answer, now.

564
00:22:37,284 --> 00:22:38,225
You have to go?

565
00:22:38,227 --> 00:22:39,960
Yeah. Can I call you back?

566
00:22:39,962 --> 00:22:41,695
Sure.

567
00:22:42,074 --> 00:22:44,198
What's wrong?

568
00:22:44,579 --> 00:22:45,399
Nothing.

569
00:22:45,401 --> 00:22:46,484
Yes, I'm calling from

570
00:22:46,514 --> 00:22:49,002
the law offices of Florrick/Quinn.

571
00:22:49,825 --> 00:22:51,839
The Midwest offices.

572
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:53,140
I'd like to set a meeting

573
00:22:53,142 --> 00:22:55,742
to discuss what our firm can do for you.

574
00:22:57,714 --> 00:22:59,746
Okay, sure. Thank you.

575
00:23:11,769 --> 00:23:14,185
_

576
00:23:31,939 --> 00:23:33,882
_

577
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:14,434
Good afternoon, I'm calling from the
Midwest offices of Florrick/Quinn.

578
00:24:14,464 --> 00:24:15,489
I'd like to set a meeting

579
00:24:15,491 --> 00:24:17,598
to discuss what our firm can do for you.

580
00:24:17,628 --> 00:24:19,662
Oh, could you hold on a second.

581
00:24:19,692 --> 00:24:20,761
Let me close my door.

582
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:24,086
That's much better.

583
00:24:24,116 --> 00:24:25,198
Would you mind transferring me

584
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,501
to whoever deals with outside counsel?

585
00:24:28,904 --> 00:24:29,821
Oh, really?

586
00:24:29,851 --> 00:24:31,505
You're looking for a new firm?

587
00:24:32,305 --> 00:24:34,178
Well, that's great news.

588
00:24:34,815 --> 00:24:37,116
Do you mind transferring me to...

589
00:24:37,581 --> 00:24:39,680
whoever I should talk to.

590
00:24:40,056 --> 00:24:41,114
Thank you.

591
00:24:43,179 --> 00:24:45,910
This is Bea Wilson at National
Council on Women's Rights.

592
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,490
Who am I speaking to?

593
00:24:48,509 --> 00:24:49,750
Grace Florrick

594
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,880
at Florrick, Quinn & Associates.

595
00:24:52,414 --> 00:24:54,594
I was hoping we could discuss possibly

596
00:24:54,596 --> 00:24:56,930
representing your organization

597
00:24:56,932 --> 00:25:00,720
in all of its legal concerns and issues.

598
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:02,134
And so on.

599
00:25:02,164 --> 00:25:04,491
Yes, I would like that.

600
00:25:04,521 --> 00:25:05,539
We're just in the process

601
00:25:05,541 --> 00:25:08,638
of considering moving our legal business.

602
00:25:08,668 --> 00:25:11,465
When would you be able to accommodate us?

603
00:25:11,495 --> 00:25:13,172
Accommodate you?

604
00:25:13,809 --> 00:25:15,390
As in becoming your law firm?

605
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:16,883
Yes.

606
00:25:16,885 --> 00:25:20,286
This is Florrick/Quinn as
in Alicia Florrick, yes?

607
00:25:20,316 --> 00:25:21,488
Yes.

608
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:23,626
We've worked with her before.

609
00:25:23,656 --> 00:25:26,193
When could we make the transfer?

610
00:25:26,581 --> 00:25:28,128
Wh...

611
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:29,463
Wh-Whenever you want.

612
00:25:29,465 --> 00:25:30,697
Good.

613
00:25:30,699 --> 00:25:32,032
Please call me tomorrow,

614
00:25:32,034 --> 00:25:33,634
and I'll send over the necessary papers.

615
00:25:49,972 --> 00:25:51,082
Mrs. Lockhart,

616
00:25:51,112 --> 00:25:52,176
if you ever need anything,

617
00:25:52,206 --> 00:25:54,096
I'm one of the new associates... Brian.

618
00:25:54,126 --> 00:25:55,559
Ms. Lockhart.

619
00:25:55,561 --> 00:25:57,497
Oh, that's right, sorry.

620
00:25:57,527 --> 00:25:58,762
Use me in any way you want.

621
00:25:58,764 --> 00:26:00,870
Carrying boxes, killing spiders.

622
00:26:02,168 --> 00:26:03,800
Brian, can you give us a minute?

623
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:04,973
Sure. That I can do.

624
00:26:05,003 --> 00:26:06,336
Get out of the way.

625
00:26:07,783 --> 00:26:09,973
Good hires, these smart ones.

626
00:26:12,126 --> 00:26:14,644
That was Mike and Ginger
from the Justice Center.

627
00:26:14,646 --> 00:26:16,629
They're leaving.

628
00:26:17,621 --> 00:26:18,927
This is a First Amendment case.

629
00:26:18,957 --> 00:26:20,751
I know that, and you know
that, but they don't know that.

630
00:26:20,781 --> 00:26:21,894
Then have them talk to me.

631
00:26:21,924 --> 00:26:23,592
They don't want to be
argued out of their position.

632
00:26:23,622 --> 00:26:25,127
There isn't much neutral
ground on abortion.

633
00:26:25,157 --> 00:26:27,357
On free speech.

634
00:26:28,011 --> 00:26:29,948
Your Honor, we will stipulate

635
00:26:29,978 --> 00:26:31,812
that the non-disclosure agreement

636
00:26:31,814 --> 00:26:33,280
applied on the premises,

637
00:26:33,282 --> 00:26:35,108
but the conversation
did not take place there.

638
00:26:35,138 --> 00:26:37,306
They met at the conference and were on

639
00:26:37,336 --> 00:26:39,503
- an officially scheduled break.
- Off-premises.

640
00:26:39,505 --> 00:26:41,343
You're saying the
conversation wasn't covered

641
00:26:41,373 --> 00:26:43,124
by the non-disclosure agreement

642
00:26:43,154 --> 00:26:44,502
because it happened somewhere else?

643
00:26:44,532 --> 00:26:46,415
- Yes.
- Your Honor, we can show that the trip

644
00:26:46,445 --> 00:26:48,879
to the yogurt store was just
an extension of the conference,

645
00:26:48,881 --> 00:26:51,214
but we will need to see the video again.

646
00:26:54,987 --> 00:26:56,920
Canning & Associates.

647
00:26:57,469 --> 00:26:58,469
Lucca.

648
00:26:59,324 --> 00:27:00,924
I will see you now.

649
00:27:01,182 --> 00:27:02,859
Don't look now, but the guy
I kicked out of your office

650
00:27:02,861 --> 00:27:04,328
just walked by.

651
00:27:05,186 --> 00:27:05,929
Why would you do that?

652
00:27:05,931 --> 00:27:07,197
Well, where else are you going to work?

653
00:27:07,199 --> 00:27:09,066
A shared office? Out of your home?

654
00:27:09,068 --> 00:27:10,367
I haven't taken the job

655
00:27:10,369 --> 00:27:12,235
and you haven't made your pitch.

656
00:27:12,237 --> 00:27:13,422
If you really want me here...

657
00:27:13,452 --> 00:27:15,161
We're gonna play let's make a deal.

658
00:27:15,191 --> 00:27:17,342
But if you say "yes,"

659
00:27:17,372 --> 00:27:20,060
you get what's behind all three doors.

660
00:27:21,596 --> 00:27:23,095
Montego-Portmore Estates.

661
00:27:23,125 --> 00:27:25,566
It's the second largest
hospitality chain in Jamaica

662
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:27,418
and soon to be your client.

663
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:30,137
Your dad's Jamaican; they'll like that.

664
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:34,049
Arthur Beadle and Sons.

665
00:27:34,432 --> 00:27:35,377
The department store?

666
00:27:35,407 --> 00:27:36,892
Yeah, one of the sons had some trouble.

667
00:27:36,922 --> 00:27:37,778
He's in and out of prison.

668
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:41,586
Your work as a bar attorney
will go a long way with Arthur.

669
00:27:41,616 --> 00:27:43,015
This one's special.

670
00:27:43,017 --> 00:27:44,036
Inner Heart Hope?

671
00:27:44,066 --> 00:27:45,664
They perform low-cost surgeries

672
00:27:45,694 --> 00:27:48,654
in Third World nations via remote feed.

673
00:27:48,656 --> 00:27:51,453
They need someone like you.

674
00:27:51,483 --> 00:27:53,965
Look, I want you, Lucca,

675
00:27:53,995 --> 00:27:55,862
not Alicia,

676
00:27:55,864 --> 00:27:57,363
so give it some thought

677
00:27:57,365 --> 00:27:59,872
but I need to know within 24 hours.

678
00:27:59,902 --> 00:28:01,601
So?

679
00:28:02,061 --> 00:28:04,104
You ever hear that joke about the Irish guy

680
00:28:04,106 --> 00:28:05,438
who goes to confession?

681
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,922
I can't say that I have.

682
00:28:06,952 --> 00:28:08,675
He says he's committed adultery.

683
00:28:08,677 --> 00:28:10,043
The priest asks,

684
00:28:10,045 --> 00:28:11,533
"Was it Mrs. O'Leary?"

685
00:28:11,563 --> 00:28:12,829
The guy says no.

686
00:28:12,831 --> 00:28:14,497
"Mrs. O'Grady?"

687
00:28:14,527 --> 00:28:15,631
No.

688
00:28:15,633 --> 00:28:16,866
"Mrs. O'Donnell?"

689
00:28:16,868 --> 00:28:17,803
Still no.

690
00:28:17,833 --> 00:28:20,859
Guy walks out of confessional and says,

691
00:28:20,889 --> 00:28:23,573
"I got three good leads."

692
00:28:23,575 --> 00:28:24,759
Canning gave you names?

693
00:28:24,789 --> 00:28:27,354
Montego-Portmore Estates, Arthur Beadle,

694
00:28:27,384 --> 00:28:29,215
and Inner Heart Hope.

695
00:28:29,245 --> 00:28:32,420
They add up to $10 million.

696
00:28:32,738 --> 00:28:33,889
I called them all on the way over.

697
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:35,218
We can pitch them tomorrow.

698
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,553
Mm-hmm.

699
00:28:36,555 --> 00:28:38,360
Not here... it'll look like a hobby.

700
00:28:39,186 --> 00:28:40,390
Hey, Mom.

701
00:28:40,392 --> 00:28:41,531
I got a client.

702
00:28:41,561 --> 00:28:44,260
That's great, honey. Good job.

703
00:28:44,262 --> 00:28:45,695
We'll be right back.

704
00:28:58,756 --> 00:29:00,143
Hello, Florrick, Quinn & Associates.

705
00:29:00,145 --> 00:29:01,533
This is Grace. How may I help you?

706
00:29:01,563 --> 00:29:04,594
Hello, this is Ginger Gaye
from the Justice Center.

707
00:29:04,624 --> 00:29:06,800
Bea Wilson from NCW gave me your number

708
00:29:06,802 --> 00:29:08,973
and said you might be open to new clients.

709
00:29:09,003 --> 00:29:10,644
Yes. I think we are.

710
00:29:10,674 --> 00:29:12,038
What was your business again, ma'am?

711
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,440
The Justice Center.

712
00:29:13,442 --> 00:29:15,242
I know we're not as big as NCW,

713
00:29:15,244 --> 00:29:18,745
but we have $2 million a
year in billing, and growing.

714
00:29:18,747 --> 00:29:21,297
We're moving on from Lockhart, Agos & Lee.

715
00:29:21,327 --> 00:29:22,649
Yes. I mean, we are a little busy,

716
00:29:22,651 --> 00:29:25,619
but we're never too busy
for a business like yours.

717
00:29:27,923 --> 00:29:29,656
I have a couple minutes. Walk and talk?

718
00:29:29,658 --> 00:29:31,015
Great.

719
00:29:33,022 --> 00:29:35,662
As you can see, the conversation
starts at the conference

720
00:29:35,664 --> 00:29:40,072
in the hotel and continues as they walk
across the street to the yogurt shop.

721
00:29:40,102 --> 00:29:41,432
Ms. Steel is right.

722
00:29:41,462 --> 00:29:43,509
The conversation was continuous,

723
00:29:43,539 --> 00:29:44,838
which makes this meeting essentially

724
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,662
an extension of the conference.

725
00:29:46,692 --> 00:29:49,059
The nondisclosure agreement holds.

726
00:29:49,061 --> 00:29:51,628
The release of the full
video is hereby enjoined.

727
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:53,839
Your Honor, we ask for a recess

728
00:29:53,869 --> 00:29:55,699
to prepare another motion.

729
00:29:55,701 --> 00:29:56,967
Let it go.

730
00:29:59,015 --> 00:30:00,381
Granted.

731
00:30:00,411 --> 00:30:02,333
Recess for lunch.

732
00:30:03,149 --> 00:30:04,430
Ms. Lockhart, do you have a moment?

733
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:05,675
Uh, no, I don't.

734
00:30:05,677 --> 00:30:06,943
There's still a way you can fight this.

735
00:30:06,945 --> 00:30:08,445
Maybe we can talk another time.

736
00:30:08,447 --> 00:30:09,448
Cary.

737
00:30:09,478 --> 00:30:11,014
She's a whistle-blower.

738
00:30:11,016 --> 00:30:12,682
Try the whistle-blower statute.

739
00:30:14,685 --> 00:30:16,873
Quote the Bible all you want, Court,

740
00:30:16,903 --> 00:30:19,189
but you're just trying to
screw me out of what is mine.

741
00:30:19,191 --> 00:30:21,458
No, Larry, I'm trying to make a difference.

742
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:24,094
Which is something you
would know nothing about.

743
00:30:24,096 --> 00:30:26,262
I went to Cambodia. Sri Lanka.

744
00:30:26,264 --> 00:30:29,295
All to film footage for Citizen
Nonino. What do you call that?

745
00:30:29,325 --> 00:30:32,109
Squandering my money on
making experimental films

746
00:30:32,139 --> 00:30:34,512
that nobody has or will ever see.

747
00:30:34,542 --> 00:30:37,042
If I may offer a solution.

748
00:30:37,072 --> 00:30:38,415
What if instead of a salary floor,

749
00:30:38,445 --> 00:30:39,544
your employees received

750
00:30:39,574 --> 00:30:42,178
unlimited vacation and sick days?

751
00:30:42,731 --> 00:30:44,180
Alicia?

752
00:30:44,587 --> 00:30:47,784
Yes. That is one way you could go.

753
00:30:48,986 --> 00:30:52,355
Do you, um, rent out that conference room?

754
00:30:53,126 --> 00:30:55,630
Your Honor, at this time
my client would like to file

755
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:57,266
pursuant to the Illinois False Claims Act.

756
00:30:57,296 --> 00:30:58,561
The whistle-blower statute?

757
00:30:58,563 --> 00:30:59,832
All due respect, Judge,

758
00:30:59,862 --> 00:31:01,460
but this is what my mother
would call "fercockt."

759
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:03,266
Who is your whistle-blower?

760
00:31:03,268 --> 00:31:05,740
- She is.
- Diane, you are amazing.

761
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:07,105
I admire you so much.

762
00:31:07,135 --> 00:31:08,541
Your Honor, as my father would say,

763
00:31:08,571 --> 00:31:11,707
this is like putting an ass's
bridle on a Model T Ford.

764
00:31:11,709 --> 00:31:14,069
Okay, I don't even get that one.

765
00:31:14,099 --> 00:31:15,616
The 8th Street Clinic receives

766
00:31:15,646 --> 00:31:18,070
state funding for procedures they perform,

767
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:20,166
which they are misrepresenting.

768
00:31:20,168 --> 00:31:22,341
The tapes demonstrate that fraud,

769
00:31:22,371 --> 00:31:24,026
and therefore they cannot be censored.

770
00:31:24,056 --> 00:31:26,056
It's a creative claim, Ms. Lockhart.

771
00:31:26,058 --> 00:31:27,490
Please approach.

772
00:31:31,729 --> 00:31:33,602
We need to talk.

773
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:36,333
This is not ex parte, but we need to talk.

774
00:31:36,335 --> 00:31:38,002
Whenever you want, Your Honor.

775
00:31:38,032 --> 00:31:39,035
Now.

776
00:31:39,037 --> 00:31:41,265
Diane, what are you doing here?

777
00:31:41,295 --> 00:31:42,572
Your Honor?

778
00:31:42,602 --> 00:31:45,785
Please, stop with the "Your Honor."

779
00:31:45,815 --> 00:31:47,673
This is just "Ben."

780
00:31:47,703 --> 00:31:49,901
You really think your
client is a whistle-blower?

781
00:31:49,931 --> 00:31:51,431
She was reporting a public fraud.

782
00:31:51,433 --> 00:31:52,732
To whom?

783
00:31:52,734 --> 00:31:54,923
She didn't serve notice to this court.

784
00:31:54,953 --> 00:31:57,020
Did she notify the SA's office?

785
00:31:57,022 --> 00:31:58,960
The Attorney General? The FBI?

786
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:00,389
- No, but...
- Then under the statute

787
00:32:00,391 --> 00:32:03,159
she has not provided proper notice.

788
00:32:03,161 --> 00:32:05,200
Then she posted the video online.

789
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:07,230
Are you telling me that
this doesn't satisfy

790
00:32:07,232 --> 00:32:09,656
the spirit of the notice requirement?

791
00:32:09,686 --> 00:32:12,936
I'm telling you it's too much of a reach.

792
00:32:12,938 --> 00:32:14,437
And even more so, I don't understand

793
00:32:14,439 --> 00:32:17,741
why you're trying so damn hard to make it.

794
00:32:17,743 --> 00:32:19,943
Diane, I've known you for a long time

795
00:32:19,945 --> 00:32:21,911
and this...

796
00:32:22,452 --> 00:32:24,809
this is not your case.

797
00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:28,218
Are you saying that I
shouldn't pursue this case

798
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:30,420
because of my politics?

799
00:32:31,064 --> 00:32:33,323
I'm saying you shouldn't be pursuing this

800
00:32:33,325 --> 00:32:35,077
because it's not you.

801
00:32:35,107 --> 00:32:37,360
This is about free speech, and you know it.

802
00:32:37,362 --> 00:32:38,563
No, I don't know it.

803
00:32:38,593 --> 00:32:40,763
This undercover tape is disgusting.

804
00:32:40,793 --> 00:32:42,632
It's like James O'Keefe with ACORN.

805
00:32:42,634 --> 00:32:45,034
It's like all right wing Republicans.

806
00:32:45,036 --> 00:32:46,603
They don't play fair.

807
00:32:46,605 --> 00:32:48,327
This is...

808
00:32:50,523 --> 00:32:52,008
You can't be telling me this.

809
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:53,141
And yet I am.

810
00:32:53,171 --> 00:32:56,012
I want you to stop
trying to make this work.

811
00:32:56,467 --> 00:32:58,014
So let's go back out there,

812
00:32:58,016 --> 00:33:00,817
put this to bed, and make sure those videos

813
00:33:00,819 --> 00:33:02,752
never see the light of day.

814
00:33:06,188 --> 00:33:07,625
What happened?

815
00:33:09,698 --> 00:33:12,068
Your plaintiff who had the abortion,

816
00:33:12,098 --> 00:33:13,302
Stacy Groom.

817
00:33:13,332 --> 00:33:14,631
The one you ripped apart?

818
00:33:14,633 --> 00:33:16,833
Yes.

819
00:33:18,611 --> 00:33:20,904
We're putting her on the stand.

820
00:33:26,593 --> 00:33:28,973
- Thank you for coming.
- We-we know you're very busy.

821
00:33:29,003 --> 00:33:30,061
I am, but...

822
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:34,541
- We understand you're not entirely hap...
- As my father would say, wha gwan.

823
00:33:35,283 --> 00:33:37,837
We'd like to tell you about our firm.

824
00:33:37,867 --> 00:33:39,249
It's not as big as Canning's,

825
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:41,263
- but we see that as a plus.
- Do you travel?

826
00:33:41,293 --> 00:33:42,960
Do I? Oh, yes, I love to.

827
00:33:42,962 --> 00:33:44,987
We're opening hotels
throughout the Caribbean.

828
00:33:45,017 --> 00:33:48,065
We need manpower. How
many partners do you have?

829
00:33:48,067 --> 00:33:50,133
- Six, currently.
- Two.

830
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,139
But what we lack in numbers,

831
00:33:52,169 --> 00:33:53,674
we make up for in aggressiveness.

832
00:33:53,704 --> 00:33:56,618
And experience, Mr. Beadle.

833
00:33:56,648 --> 00:33:58,475
At a firm like Florrick & Agos,

834
00:33:58,477 --> 00:34:02,237
- Quinn.
- We... What? Oh. Excuse me.

835
00:34:02,267 --> 00:34:05,449
At a firm like Florrick & Quinn,

836
00:34:05,451 --> 00:34:08,452
what we're most proud
of is our corporate work.

837
00:34:09,204 --> 00:34:12,322
I'm sorry, not corporate.
Our charitable work.

838
00:34:12,744 --> 00:34:15,859
So... we'll look forward
to hearing from you.

839
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:20,797
Well, that didn't go... well.

840
00:34:20,827 --> 00:34:21,598
Nope.

841
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,967
- Florrick/Agos?
- Criminal litigation?

842
00:34:23,997 --> 00:34:24,919
His son.

843
00:34:24,949 --> 00:34:26,804
No, he doesn't want to be reminded of that.

844
00:34:26,834 --> 00:34:27,638
Plus, six partners?

845
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,706
- I was thinking futuristically.
- Lucca...

846
00:34:29,708 --> 00:34:32,566
No, there's no question.

847
00:34:32,596 --> 00:34:34,754
Diane Lockhart's an excellent lawyer.

848
00:34:34,784 --> 00:34:37,343
But we have the expertise...

849
00:34:37,373 --> 00:34:39,683
One second, Jojo.

850
00:34:41,253 --> 00:34:43,453
Lippincott Mutual.

851
00:34:44,824 --> 00:34:46,199
Sorry, Jojo.

852
00:34:46,229 --> 00:34:48,229
One of our lawyers is
actually dealing with horses.

853
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,533
I know.

854
00:34:50,563 --> 00:34:51,962
Good help these days.

855
00:34:52,774 --> 00:34:54,218
So, yes, I actually do think

856
00:34:54,248 --> 00:34:56,933
- we can squeeze in a meeting tomorrow.
- Ms. Groom,

857
00:34:56,935 --> 00:34:58,568
did the 8th Street Clinic

858
00:34:58,570 --> 00:35:00,537
- perform an abortion on you?
- Objection.

859
00:35:00,539 --> 00:35:02,103
What is the relevance of this witness?

860
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:03,940
- I was wondering that myself.
- Ms. Groom is

861
00:35:03,942 --> 00:35:06,615
a private citizen who
believes she has been defrauded

862
00:35:06,645 --> 00:35:08,044
and is now reporting it.

863
00:35:08,046 --> 00:35:10,613
Here. To this court.

864
00:35:10,615 --> 00:35:12,715
She is our whistle-blower.

865
00:35:13,539 --> 00:35:15,652
Objection overruled.

866
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:17,554
Proceed.

867
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:20,723
Ms. Groom, did the 8th Street Clinic

868
00:35:20,725 --> 00:35:22,492
- perform an abortion on you?
- They did.

869
00:35:22,494 --> 00:35:24,938
- Ten months ago.
- And did Dr. Hallie Fisher

870
00:35:24,968 --> 00:35:26,231
perform that abortion? The woman

871
00:35:26,261 --> 00:35:27,456
- in the video?
- Yes.

872
00:35:27,486 --> 00:35:29,933
And did she accurately
represent that procedure

873
00:35:29,935 --> 00:35:31,018
- to you?
- No.

874
00:35:31,048 --> 00:35:33,369
She tricked me into donating fetal tissue.

875
00:35:33,371 --> 00:35:35,371
She never told me it would be sold.

876
00:35:35,373 --> 00:35:38,508
She even flipped the baby
into a breech position

877
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:41,044
- to help better harvest the organs.
- Objection.

878
00:35:41,046 --> 00:35:43,557
Misstates evidence. There's
been no testimony to this effect.

879
00:35:43,587 --> 00:35:46,165
Are you denying that Ms. Groom's
abortion involved a breech?

880
00:35:46,195 --> 00:35:48,296
No. I'm saying there's
no evidence as to cause.

881
00:35:48,326 --> 00:35:50,787
Yes, because you've
denied us that evidence.

882
00:35:51,588 --> 00:35:54,624
We need a hearing on acquiring
the 8th Street Clinic's

883
00:35:54,626 --> 00:35:56,749
- medical records.
- Objection sustained.

884
00:35:56,779 --> 00:36:00,630
Do you have any more questions
for this witness, Ms. Lockhart?

885
00:36:02,156 --> 00:36:03,841
I do not.

886
00:36:05,196 --> 00:36:08,371
Ms. Groom, these symptoms you discuss,

887
00:36:08,746 --> 00:36:10,573
have you reported them to a doctor?

888
00:36:10,575 --> 00:36:11,708
Yes. I received

889
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:13,175
- a PTSD diagnosis.
- Really?

890
00:36:13,205 --> 00:36:14,252
When was that?

891
00:36:14,282 --> 00:36:15,867
- Yesterday.
- Yesterday?

892
00:36:15,897 --> 00:36:17,812
Great. Before your testimony here.

893
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,252
- Objection, Your Honor.
- Overruled.

894
00:36:19,282 --> 00:36:20,700
You said that Dr. Fisher

895
00:36:20,702 --> 00:36:21,835
tricked you

896
00:36:21,837 --> 00:36:23,069
into donating tissue.

897
00:36:23,071 --> 00:36:24,404
- How did she do that?
- She said

898
00:36:24,406 --> 00:36:26,306
the donation was for research purposes

899
00:36:26,308 --> 00:36:28,174
and my health wouldn't be compromised.

900
00:36:28,176 --> 00:36:30,610
- And it wasn't, was it?
- She said on the video

901
00:36:30,612 --> 00:36:34,381
babies are moved into a breech position.

902
00:36:36,081 --> 00:36:39,264
Ms. Groom, when did you join
the Church of God in Christ?

903
00:36:39,294 --> 00:36:40,974
- Objection, Your Honor.
- Goes to state of mind.

904
00:36:41,004 --> 00:36:44,624
No. It is an indictment of this
woman's beliefs, and that's outrageous.

905
00:36:44,626 --> 00:36:46,666
- What happened to constitutional freedoms?
- This woman was pro-choice.

906
00:36:46,696 --> 00:36:49,262
She had an abortion of her own free will...

907
00:36:49,264 --> 00:36:52,699
Yes. Yes.

908
00:36:53,915 --> 00:36:55,434
Uh, absolutely.

909
00:36:55,464 --> 00:36:56,768
Mm-hmm.

910
00:36:58,854 --> 00:37:00,440
Um...

911
00:37:00,803 --> 00:37:03,009
sure.

912
00:37:05,783 --> 00:37:07,013
Well, when?

913
00:37:08,143 --> 00:37:09,549
Okay.

914
00:37:10,889 --> 00:37:12,257
Um...

915
00:37:12,287 --> 00:37:13,520
Uh, tomorrow.

916
00:37:13,822 --> 00:37:15,822
Thank you. Okay.

917
00:37:15,824 --> 00:37:16,989
Bye.

918
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,393
Nice picture of you and the Pope.

919
00:37:20,395 --> 00:37:22,200
Thanks.

920
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:24,636
Did you decide what you wanted to do

921
00:37:24,666 --> 00:37:28,381
with, you know, the
unlimited vacation days?

922
00:37:28,411 --> 00:37:30,837
Eli, what are you doing here?

923
00:37:31,787 --> 00:37:33,339
Why am I...

924
00:37:33,341 --> 00:37:35,861
I thought that you wanted me to stay.

925
00:37:35,891 --> 00:37:38,359
And your concern is Governor Florrick?

926
00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:40,513
Yes. What do you mean?

927
00:37:41,344 --> 00:37:44,122
Well, it's important to understand motives,

928
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:45,919
don't you think?

929
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:51,191
- Always.
- Unlimited vacations is a ploy.

930
00:37:51,193 --> 00:37:54,527
It's-it's cynicism
disguised as benevolence.

931
00:37:54,529 --> 00:37:55,350
And you know that.

932
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:57,931
I know... H-How do I know that?

933
00:37:57,933 --> 00:38:00,066
Oh, give me some credit.

934
00:38:00,068 --> 00:38:04,404
When companies offer unlimited vacations,

935
00:38:04,406 --> 00:38:07,273
employees take even less vacations.

936
00:38:07,275 --> 00:38:09,943
They're so paranoid about
pulling their own weight,

937
00:38:09,945 --> 00:38:11,945
they don't even use their usual two weeks.

938
00:38:11,947 --> 00:38:14,047
That was not my intent.

939
00:38:14,049 --> 00:38:17,617
Well, then... what is your intent?

940
00:38:19,853 --> 00:38:22,589
What are we talking about now?

941
00:38:22,591 --> 00:38:23,957
You're in my office.

942
00:38:23,959 --> 00:38:26,192
The door is closed.

943
00:38:27,508 --> 00:38:31,264
You still trying to "help" me?

944
00:38:32,779 --> 00:38:34,634
I'm not good at this.

945
00:38:34,636 --> 00:38:36,836
What is this?

946
00:38:38,389 --> 00:38:40,740
You're beautiful.

947
00:38:41,655 --> 00:38:42,976
And I'm...

948
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:46,513
Well, I have my moments, but...

949
00:38:47,321 --> 00:38:49,449
My office is the size of your bathroom.

950
00:38:49,451 --> 00:38:51,417
And I don't have...

951
00:38:51,921 --> 00:38:54,988
the money you have.

952
00:39:00,665 --> 00:39:02,228
Come here.

953
00:39:06,281 --> 00:39:08,093
Okay.

954
00:39:24,513 --> 00:39:27,742
Well, I'm sorry we won't
be working together.

955
00:39:27,991 --> 00:39:30,390
Yeah. Thank you for your time.

956
00:39:31,241 --> 00:39:32,792
That was the last one.

957
00:39:32,794 --> 00:39:35,828
I thought Canning's clients
would be easier to pick off.

958
00:39:36,511 --> 00:39:37,441
What do we do?

959
00:39:37,471 --> 00:39:40,833
- Mom?
- Yeah, Grace, just give us a minute.

960
00:39:40,835 --> 00:39:43,668
No, actually, I think you want to
hear this. I got four new clients.

961
00:39:43,698 --> 00:39:46,005
That's great, honey. I'll
be in in a few minutes.

962
00:39:46,007 --> 00:39:47,640
NCW. Justice Center.

963
00:39:47,642 --> 00:39:50,639
Preservation Basin. And Jojo Lee's company.

964
00:39:53,945 --> 00:39:56,115
Excuse me?

965
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:06,248
- Excuse me?
- NCW.

966
00:40:06,278 --> 00:40:08,054
The Justice Center. Preservation Basin.

967
00:40:08,084 --> 00:40:09,550
And Jojo Lee's company.

968
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,320
I...

969
00:40:12,867 --> 00:40:15,568
You-you talked to them?

970
00:40:15,598 --> 00:40:17,822
- Yes.
- NCW?

971
00:40:17,852 --> 00:40:20,436
Who did you talk to at NCW?

972
00:40:20,466 --> 00:40:24,019
- Um, Bea Wilson.
- Bea Wilson?

973
00:40:24,049 --> 00:40:25,299
The Bea Wilson?

974
00:40:25,301 --> 00:40:27,977
Well, a Bea Wilson.

975
00:40:28,007 --> 00:40:29,770
How did you get all those firms?

976
00:40:29,772 --> 00:40:32,528
Apparently they're unhappy
with Diane Lockhart.

977
00:40:32,822 --> 00:40:35,643
So, can you make time to meet with them?

978
00:40:36,258 --> 00:40:38,266
Y-Yeah. Yeah.

979
00:40:38,296 --> 00:40:41,182
The reason we haven't been able
to produce the medical records

980
00:40:41,184 --> 00:40:44,418
to substantiate our claim
is that we have been denied

981
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:46,855
- the minute-by-minute procedure notes.
- You have no basis

982
00:40:46,885 --> 00:40:48,292
- for discovery.
- It's a catch-22,

983
00:40:48,322 --> 00:40:49,824
Your Honor. I need the evidence

984
00:40:49,854 --> 00:40:51,666
they have to get the evidence they have.

985
00:40:51,696 --> 00:40:54,801
That is a problem, Ms. Lockhart. For you.

986
00:40:56,005 --> 00:40:58,599
Well, you could fix it
with an evidentiary order.

987
00:40:58,601 --> 00:41:00,401
Let me think about that.

988
00:41:01,149 --> 00:41:02,370
No.

989
00:41:06,405 --> 00:41:09,023
Your Honor, per Illinois rule 735

990
00:41:09,053 --> 00:41:14,215
ILCS 5/2-1001, I would
like to file a motion

991
00:41:14,217 --> 00:41:16,682
- for substitution of judge.
- You're asking me

992
00:41:16,712 --> 00:41:18,686
- to remove myself from this case?
- Yes.

993
00:41:18,688 --> 00:41:20,187
- On what grounds?
- Political bias.

994
00:41:20,189 --> 00:41:22,323
Motion denied. There
is nothing in the record

995
00:41:22,325 --> 00:41:24,538
to reflect any bias on my part,

996
00:41:24,568 --> 00:41:26,627
- political or otherwise.
- There is nothing on the record

997
00:41:26,629 --> 00:41:28,589
because you pulled me into chambers

998
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:30,231
for an improper ex parte conversation.

999
00:41:30,233 --> 00:41:31,665
- You stop right there!
- Which revealed

1000
00:41:31,667 --> 00:41:33,000
your bias against both me

1001
00:41:33,002 --> 00:41:35,102
- and my clients' case.
- Denied!

1002
00:41:35,104 --> 00:41:36,833
Again. Want to keep getting knocked down?

1003
00:41:36,863 --> 00:41:39,774
It is not fair that you, who are
biased, get to rule on your bias.

1004
00:41:39,776 --> 00:41:41,709
It is fair. And you are way over the line.

1005
00:41:41,711 --> 00:41:43,210
- Your Honor, I am asking...
- Ms. Lockhart,

1006
00:41:43,212 --> 00:41:46,213
I have made my ruling!

1007
00:41:46,576 --> 00:41:48,749
You're welcome to proceed with your case.

1008
00:41:49,249 --> 00:41:52,326
And I assure you I will
give it all the consideration

1009
00:41:52,356 --> 00:41:54,189
it deserves.

1010
00:41:59,238 --> 00:42:00,761
I'm sorry. I tried

1011
00:42:00,763 --> 00:42:03,724
my best, but I've just become a liability.

1012
00:42:03,754 --> 00:42:07,854
It's in your clients' best
interests for me to withdraw.

1013
00:42:09,679 --> 00:42:10,971
Nicely played.

1014
00:42:11,676 --> 00:42:15,113
You found a way out without
backing down from anyone. Kudos.

1015
00:42:15,143 --> 00:42:17,678
I have no idea what you're talking about.

1016
00:42:17,932 --> 00:42:20,748
Okay. But it's time to
get our clients back.

1017
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:21,955
I'm on it.

1018
00:42:21,985 --> 00:42:23,484
Here we go.

1019
00:42:24,145 --> 00:42:24,886
We did it.

1020
00:42:24,888 --> 00:42:28,393
- Bravo.
- Jason, you're just in time.

1021
00:42:28,423 --> 00:42:30,425
- For what?
- To celebrate.

1022
00:42:30,455 --> 00:42:31,592
New business. New life.

1023
00:42:31,594 --> 00:42:33,699
And we owe it all to Grace.

1024
00:42:33,729 --> 00:42:35,695
Well, congratulations.

1025
00:42:35,908 --> 00:42:37,334
Oh, Mom, do you have a minute?

1026
00:42:37,364 --> 00:42:39,967
Sure. Thanks for all your help, Grace.

1027
00:42:39,969 --> 00:42:41,911
No problem.

1028
00:42:41,941 --> 00:42:45,672
Um, so it works out to $35,800.

1029
00:42:45,702 --> 00:42:46,891
For the year.

1030
00:42:46,921 --> 00:42:48,238
What's that?

1031
00:42:48,268 --> 00:42:50,283
A half percent of the billable hours.

1032
00:42:50,698 --> 00:42:52,407
That's what you owe me.

1033
00:42:53,272 --> 00:42:55,347
Cash or check is fine.
