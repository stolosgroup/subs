1
00:00:08,287 --> 00:00:09,888
Cary asked me.

2
00:00:10,289 --> 00:00:11,421
I know.

3
00:00:11,422 --> 00:00:13,290
He's just on a call.

4
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,229
So, the IRA agreed to
an Offer and Compromise,

5
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:21,631
on your tax case.

6
00:00:21,632 --> 00:00:22,966
The IRA?

7
00:00:24,569 --> 00:00:27,403
The... the IRS.

8
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:29,105
You'll have to
pay a penalty,

9
00:00:29,106 --> 00:00:30,806
we can deal with all
the specifics later,

10
00:00:30,807 --> 00:00:33,008
but you have some un-cashed
checks in your file.

11
00:00:33,009 --> 00:00:34,543
You should take a
look at those.

12
00:00:34,544 --> 00:00:36,579
Thanks.

13
00:00:39,249 --> 00:00:40,816
I'm not gay.

14
00:00:44,102 --> 00:00:45,987
You asked
whether I was gay?

15
00:00:45,988 --> 00:00:47,922
Yes...

16
00:00:47,923 --> 00:00:49,157
two years ago.

17
00:00:49,158 --> 00:00:51,058
I know.

18
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:53,161
I wanted to answer.

19
00:00:53,162 --> 00:00:54,929
I'm not gay, I'm...

20
00:00:57,432 --> 00:00:58,499
...flexible.

21
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,467
Okay.

22
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:04,738
Flexible. Good.

23
00:01:05,739 --> 00:01:07,073
And, uh...

24
00:01:07,574 --> 00:01:09,409
Lana Delaney,
this FBI agent,

25
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:11,845
that's... flexible?

26
00:01:12,546 --> 00:01:14,414
Yeah. Sort of.

27
00:01:15,415 --> 00:01:17,684
Because as your lawyer,
I wouldn't...

28
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:21,487
You know what, it's your life.
You do what you want.

29
00:01:27,194 --> 00:01:28,194
What?

30
00:01:28,195 --> 00:01:30,496
It's the Veriscene case.
The judgment's in.

31
00:01:30,497 --> 00:01:31,730
We find out tomorrow.

32
00:01:31,731 --> 00:01:33,465
That's good.

33
00:01:33,466 --> 00:01:36,902
I don't know. I've got a bad
feeling about this one.

34
00:01:37,503 --> 00:01:38,904
How's everyone this morning?

35
00:01:38,905 --> 00:01:40,205
Well, Your Honor.

36
00:01:40,206 --> 00:01:42,941
We seem to have
a designated hitter here today.

37
00:01:42,942 --> 00:01:44,309
Yes, Your Honor.

38
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,311
My partner, Will Gardner,
couldn't be in court...

39
00:01:46,312 --> 00:01:48,813
Oh, you don't have to cover for
him. I know Will's suspended.

40
00:01:48,814 --> 00:01:51,215
- How's he doing?
- Very well, thank you for asking.

41
00:01:51,216 --> 00:01:53,584
Like a kid
with five days until Christmas.

42
00:01:54,619 --> 00:01:56,453
Well, tell him
he's missed.

43
00:01:56,454 --> 00:01:58,156
Shall we get started?

44
00:01:58,157 --> 00:02:00,892
Plaintiff alleges
that Veriscene,

45
00:02:00,893 --> 00:02:03,027
a drug administered
for the cure of acne,

46
00:02:03,028 --> 00:02:05,996
caused Mr. Goode
irreversible sterility.

47
00:02:05,997 --> 00:02:08,498
Accordingly, I am entering
judgment for the plaintiff,

48
00:02:08,499 --> 00:02:11,434
in the amount of $25 million
in compensatory.

49
00:02:11,935 --> 00:02:13,737
I acknowledge that this amount

50
00:02:13,738 --> 00:02:16,807
is in excess of the $18 million
requested by the plaintiff,

51
00:02:16,808 --> 00:02:19,309
but I find the actions here
particularly heinous.

52
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:20,710
- Your Honor...
- Yes, Mr. Canning?

53
00:02:20,711 --> 00:02:22,544
You want to appeal?

54
00:02:22,545 --> 00:02:24,814
- Oh, I do. Uh vehemently.
- As is your right.

55
00:02:24,815 --> 00:02:28,350
Mr. Goode, no matter where this
ends up, I want you to know,

56
00:02:28,351 --> 00:02:31,653
justice was done here today.

57
00:02:31,654 --> 00:02:33,089
Whoo-hoo! Yes!

58
00:02:34,925 --> 00:02:36,725
Congratulations.

59
00:02:36,726 --> 00:02:39,060
I am rarely speechless,
but I am speechless.

60
00:02:39,061 --> 00:02:41,096
Thank you.
Thank you both.

61
00:02:41,097 --> 00:02:42,797
It's not over yet.
They're going to

62
00:02:42,798 --> 00:02:44,799
drag this out in
appeals, so...

63
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,234
I thought it was
going against us.

64
00:02:46,235 --> 00:02:48,636
Sometimes fate smiles.

65
00:02:48,637 --> 00:02:50,705
Will, are you
standing or sitting?

66
00:02:51,706 --> 00:02:53,506
Which one do you
want me to be?

67
00:02:57,311 --> 00:02:58,545
You're kidding.

68
00:03:00,614 --> 00:03:01,581
You're kidding.

69
00:03:01,582 --> 00:03:04,118
Do you know what this means?

70
00:03:04,119 --> 00:03:05,786
That we can pay off
our balloon payment.

71
00:03:05,787 --> 00:03:08,354
<i>And dodge the executioner
for another quarter.</i>

72
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:10,021
If you get a settlement.

73
00:03:10,022 --> 00:03:11,190
Where's Canning at?
He'll appeal.

74
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,492
For effect.
$25 million should motivate him.

75
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:16,863
Peter, you okay?

76
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:20,833
We have a problem with the house.

77
00:03:20,834 --> 00:03:22,334
We?

78
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:24,403
Uh, Jackie.

79
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:28,507
She paid ten percent in
cash on the down payment.

80
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:31,910
Apparently, she was
bidding against someone.

81
00:03:31,911 --> 00:03:35,748
Me. She was bidding against me.

82
00:03:36,499 --> 00:03:39,017
So I'm planning on going
ahead with the purchase

83
00:03:39,018 --> 00:03:41,686
and then flipping the
house in a few months.

84
00:03:41,687 --> 00:03:43,588
Okay.

85
00:03:44,589 --> 00:03:45,489
Are you moving in?

86
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:47,008
Just temporarily.
I think

87
00:03:47,009 --> 00:03:48,326
I could get more
more money for the house

88
00:03:48,327 --> 00:03:50,427
if I did some work
in the backyard.

89
00:03:51,328 --> 00:03:52,664
Why are you
telling me this, Peter?

90
00:03:53,565 --> 00:03:56,433
Look, I don't want you
to worry about these...

91
00:03:56,834 --> 00:03:57,801
decisions.

92
00:03:57,802 --> 00:04:00,904
This is all temporary.
I'm not trying to...

93
00:04:00,905 --> 00:04:02,506
Colonize our past?

94
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:06,242
Well, I don't think
I'd exactly put it that way,

95
00:04:06,243 --> 00:04:09,579
but yes, I don't want these
decisions to be misunderstood.

96
00:04:10,415 --> 00:04:12,248
Okay. I won't.

97
00:04:13,249 --> 00:04:16,352
So... we're making
this work, right?

98
00:04:16,853 --> 00:04:19,722
Oddly, yes, we are.

99
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:24,162
I heard Cary is
back with you guys.

100
00:04:24,225 --> 00:04:26,662
- Yeah, starts today.
- Oh.

101
00:04:27,063 --> 00:04:28,630
He's a good guy.

102
00:04:29,531 --> 00:04:30,565
Wish him luck.

103
00:04:31,066 --> 00:04:33,702
So, we'll need you out here until
we get an office cleared out,

104
00:04:33,703 --> 00:04:35,837
- if you're all right with that.
- I am.

105
00:04:35,838 --> 00:04:38,707
Good. It'll just
be a few weeks.

106
00:04:46,047 --> 00:04:48,649
Welcome back, Cary.

107
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,074
The best IPTV in the UK
WWW.ALLIN1BOX.CO.UK

108
00:04:57,459 --> 00:04:59,460
Whew.

109
00:05:22,681 --> 00:05:23,849
<i>AN:
Yeah?</i>

110
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:26,551
Um, is this F&E Construction?

111
00:05:28,588 --> 00:05:30,088
Hello?

112
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:32,023
<i>Who is this?</i>

113
00:05:32,424 --> 00:05:35,726
Uh, I'm a lawyer following up
on a un-cashed check

114
00:05:35,727 --> 00:05:37,828
from F&E Construction.

115
00:05:37,829 --> 00:05:41,265
Unfortunately, we'll need you
to reissue the check.

116
00:05:43,034 --> 00:05:45,703
<i>Who is this?</i>

117
00:05:45,704 --> 00:05:48,372
Um... is this F&E Construction?

118
00:05:48,373 --> 00:05:49,539
<i>Yes.</i>

119
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,775
<i>I don't recognize your voice.</i>

120
00:05:51,776 --> 00:05:54,944
I'm a lawyer representing...

121
00:05:54,945 --> 00:05:56,446
someone...

122
00:05:56,447 --> 00:06:00,082
uh, who has an un-cashed check
from F&E Construction,

123
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:03,120
and she can't access her funds,

124
00:06:03,121 --> 00:06:04,720
uh, unless you reissue, so...

125
00:06:04,821 --> 00:06:06,388
<i>Who's the check made out to?</i>

126
00:06:06,389 --> 00:06:07,890
Cash.

127
00:06:11,728 --> 00:06:14,396
<i>Where are you
calling from, lady?</i>

128
00:06:14,597 --> 00:06:16,998
Can you just reissue
the check, sir?

129
00:06:16,999 --> 00:06:20,201
<i>Sure. Give me a check number.</i>

130
00:06:23,995 --> 00:06:26,141
You know what, um, I'll call
you back with that information.

131
00:06:26,142 --> 00:06:27,842
Thank you.

132
00:06:31,363 --> 00:06:32,229
Wow.

133
00:06:32,231 --> 00:06:33,730
Oh, hey, Cary.

134
00:06:33,732 --> 00:06:35,849
- How are you doing?
- Good.

135
00:06:35,851 --> 00:06:37,601
You seem to be, too.

136
00:06:37,603 --> 00:06:40,237
Oh, it's just from being
liaison to Eli Gold.

137
00:06:40,239 --> 00:06:42,806
As soon as he's back
on the campaign trail,

138
00:06:42,808 --> 00:06:45,576
I'll be out there with
everyone else. Where are you?

139
00:06:45,578 --> 00:06:47,143
I'm out there
with everyone else.

140
00:06:47,145 --> 00:06:49,580
Well, then you'll have company.

141
00:06:49,582 --> 00:06:50,697
Canning.

142
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:51,982
Oh, Cary.

143
00:06:51,984 --> 00:06:54,034
- Good to have you back.
- Thank you.

144
00:06:54,036 --> 00:06:55,819
The Veriscene case-- we're
in the middle of negotiations.

145
00:06:55,821 --> 00:06:57,871
Yeah, go for it.
I know my way around.

146
00:06:57,873 --> 00:06:59,322
<i>We're not committing</i>

147
00:06:59,324 --> 00:07:02,392
to an offer yet, but if you
have a number, we'll listen.

148
00:07:03,795 --> 00:07:05,796
Mr. Canning,
are you with us?

149
00:07:05,798 --> 00:07:08,599
Oh, I'm sorry, I was
just texting my lawyer.

150
00:07:08,601 --> 00:07:10,851
It's funny, isn't it,
lawyers having lawyers?

151
00:07:10,853 --> 00:07:13,169
And my lawyer probably
has a lawyer, too.

152
00:07:13,171 --> 00:07:15,222
We should all be getting
progressively smaller,

153
00:07:15,224 --> 00:07:16,757
like matryoshka dolls.

154
00:07:17,609 --> 00:07:18,809
Yes. So are we
negotiating,

155
00:07:18,811 --> 00:07:20,694
- or what are we doing?
- No, we're negotiating.

156
00:07:20,696 --> 00:07:23,563
I-I think I have
an offer for you.

157
00:07:23,565 --> 00:07:25,348
A one-time offer.

158
00:07:28,736 --> 00:07:30,153
- Zero? Really?
- Yeah, unfortunately

159
00:07:30,155 --> 00:07:33,957
you have five minutes to
decide whether to take it.

160
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:35,492
I see.
And if we don't,

161
00:07:35,494 --> 00:07:37,744
you have a bomb or something?

162
00:07:37,746 --> 00:07:39,413
Sort of.

163
00:07:39,415 --> 00:07:41,415
Hi. We're all here.
Where are you?

164
00:07:41,417 --> 00:07:43,133
Just changing.
I'll be right in.

165
00:07:43,135 --> 00:07:45,385
The rash is
back, Michael.

166
00:07:45,387 --> 00:07:47,220
I know. I'm trying the
ointment three times a day.

167
00:07:47,222 --> 00:07:49,205
You have to stop
eating so much spicy food.

168
00:07:49,207 --> 00:07:52,175
Yes. No more Thai
food for <i>you.</i>

169
00:07:52,177 --> 00:07:54,428
Oh, please,
it's just poop.

170
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:56,880
You shovel the stuff
all day, buddy.

171
00:07:56,882 --> 00:07:58,565
Oh, God.

172
00:07:58,567 --> 00:08:00,150
Patti Nyholm.

173
00:08:00,152 --> 00:08:02,102
- Well, look at you.
- And you.

174
00:08:02,104 --> 00:08:04,638
Poster child
for Motherhood Today.

175
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,723
You have no changing tables
in the restroom, Will.

176
00:08:06,725 --> 00:08:09,359
- It's a lawsuit waiting to happen.
- Yep, doing our part

177
00:08:09,361 --> 00:08:10,911
to suppress the birth rate.

178
00:08:10,913 --> 00:08:12,062
So, I need

179
00:08:12,064 --> 00:08:14,364
some legal advice
on my contract.

180
00:08:14,366 --> 00:08:16,450
Oh, my God, wait.

181
00:08:16,452 --> 00:08:18,618
You can't practice
law any more.

182
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:21,171
What was I thinking?

183
00:08:21,173 --> 00:08:22,506
No, thank you.

184
00:08:22,508 --> 00:08:23,740
I'll be right out, Michael.

185
00:08:23,742 --> 00:08:25,208
This'll take a few minutes.

186
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:27,577
That must be really
hard on you, Will,

187
00:08:27,579 --> 00:08:30,047
just sitting around
watching all these lawyers

188
00:08:30,049 --> 00:08:32,299
while you're, what,
surfing the Web?

189
00:08:32,301 --> 00:08:34,584
- Clipping coupons?
- What's up, Patti?

190
00:08:34,586 --> 00:08:36,687
- A lawsuit.
- Really? Which one?

191
00:08:36,689 --> 00:08:39,940
A new one. It'll be great being
on opposite sides again,

192
00:08:39,942 --> 00:08:41,191
dusting it up...

193
00:08:41,193 --> 00:08:43,393
Oh, wait. Darn it.

194
00:08:43,395 --> 00:08:45,779
You're not a
lawyer any more.

195
00:08:45,781 --> 00:08:49,066
I keep forgetting.

196
00:08:49,068 --> 00:08:50,567
So sorry I'm late.

197
00:08:50,569 --> 00:08:51,785
Here's my lawyer now.

198
00:08:51,787 --> 00:08:53,904
Ms. Nyholm, I believe
you know everybody.

199
00:08:53,906 --> 00:08:55,872
I think I do. Hello.

200
00:08:55,874 --> 00:08:57,107
How are your
negotiations going?

201
00:08:57,109 --> 00:08:58,909
Well, I don't
know, I gave them

202
00:08:58,911 --> 00:09:02,412
five minutes to agree to my settlement
offer, and that time is up... now.

203
00:09:02,414 --> 00:09:03,497
We're suing you.

204
00:09:03,499 --> 00:09:05,465
On behalf of
LOC Pharmaceuticals,

205
00:09:05,467 --> 00:09:07,283
makers of Veriscene
and Elvatyl.

206
00:09:07,285 --> 00:09:08,635
And their insurer, LifeState.

207
00:09:08,637 --> 00:09:10,220
We joined forces

208
00:09:10,222 --> 00:09:12,355
to sue you for
$50 million

209
00:09:12,357 --> 00:09:15,291
- for fraud and malicious prosecution.
- Come on,

210
00:09:15,293 --> 00:09:17,344
- this is harassment.
- Is that your legal opinion, Will?

211
00:09:17,346 --> 00:09:18,562
No, it's mine.

212
00:09:18,564 --> 00:09:20,263
Your company
doesn't like being sued,

213
00:09:20,265 --> 00:09:22,566
try making products that
don't kill and maim people.

214
00:09:22,568 --> 00:09:24,601
Here's a better
idea-- stop intentionally

215
00:09:24,603 --> 00:09:26,436
and wrongfully instituting
legal proceedings

216
00:09:26,438 --> 00:09:28,772
- you know are without merit.
- We were just

217
00:09:28,774 --> 00:09:30,991
awarded $25 million--
I'd call that merit.

218
00:09:30,993 --> 00:09:33,543
No. I would call that
judicial bribery.

219
00:09:35,246 --> 00:09:36,246
Oops.

220
00:09:36,248 --> 00:09:37,914
Is that a sensitive topic?

221
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:39,866
This case was
built for a jury.

222
00:09:39,868 --> 00:09:41,251
You requested a bench trial.

223
00:09:41,253 --> 00:09:44,588
It's a million-dollar case,
and your basketball buddy

224
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:46,206
awarded you $25 million.

225
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:48,542
- I was cleared by a grand jury.
- No.

226
00:09:48,544 --> 00:09:50,510
You weren't indicted
by a grand jury.

227
00:09:50,512 --> 00:09:53,096
You gamed the system;
I know you, Will.

228
00:09:53,098 --> 00:09:54,881
You can't do that with me.

229
00:09:54,883 --> 00:09:57,551
- Or with me.
- That's right.

230
00:09:57,553 --> 00:09:59,803
We're the dream team.

231
00:10:09,453 --> 00:10:14,288
<font color="#FF8C00">Sync & corrections by Alice</font>
<font color="#FF8C00">www.addic7ed.com</font>

232
00:10:19,597 --> 00:10:22,031
Jackie?

233
00:10:22,533 --> 00:10:24,650
Mr. Gold?

234
00:10:24,652 --> 00:10:26,235
Hi.

235
00:10:26,237 --> 00:10:28,988
Peter said you were here.

236
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:31,373
Shouldn't you be
in synagogue?

237
00:10:32,192 --> 00:10:34,276
Uh... no.

238
00:10:34,278 --> 00:10:35,644
How are you feeling?

239
00:10:35,646 --> 00:10:36,979
- Better.
- Good.

240
00:10:36,981 --> 00:10:39,615
Then I won't feel bad
about saying this.

241
00:10:42,002 --> 00:10:44,503
Your son is
going to lose.

242
00:10:44,505 --> 00:10:47,373
Without Alicia, he will
lose the governorship.

243
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:48,874
Uh, I-I don't know...

244
00:10:48,876 --> 00:10:51,093
She was on our
side, Jackie.

245
00:10:51,095 --> 00:10:52,545
Alicia was offering
to help Peter,

246
00:10:52,547 --> 00:10:53,829
then <i>you</i> got involved.

247
00:10:53,831 --> 00:10:55,264
How did I get involved?

248
00:10:55,266 --> 00:10:56,549
This friggin' house!

249
00:10:56,551 --> 00:10:58,384
My God, I've never
heard so much

250
00:10:58,386 --> 00:11:00,386
real estate talk
in all my life.

251
00:11:00,388 --> 00:11:03,389
If their separation goes
wide, everything collapses.

252
00:11:03,391 --> 00:11:05,241
Eli, what do you want?

253
00:11:07,844 --> 00:11:10,229
I want you to apologize to her.

254
00:11:10,231 --> 00:11:12,898
Your son will
not win without Alicia,

255
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,516
and I will not
manage his campaign

256
00:11:14,518 --> 00:11:16,151
without her.

257
00:11:16,153 --> 00:11:17,352
So say, "I'm sorry"

258
00:11:17,354 --> 00:11:19,655
even if you
don't believe it.

259
00:11:23,777 --> 00:11:25,527
I dreamt I died.

260
00:11:25,529 --> 00:11:27,963
Everybody just did

261
00:11:27,965 --> 00:11:30,049
what they always did.

262
00:11:30,051 --> 00:11:31,199
They didn't care.

263
00:11:31,201 --> 00:11:33,335
Um, do you want me

264
00:11:33,337 --> 00:11:35,721
- to get you a nurse or some...
- Are you religious?

265
00:11:35,723 --> 00:11:37,590
Am I, um... I...

266
00:11:37,592 --> 00:11:39,208
I thought Jews believed in God.

267
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:41,677
Yes, we all do;
Every one of us.

268
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:42,561
I don't want to die.

269
00:11:42,563 --> 00:11:43,979
I'll get you a nurse.

270
00:11:43,981 --> 00:11:46,181
I don't want to die.

271
00:11:47,901 --> 00:11:49,068
It's a scare tactic.

272
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:50,236
Look at Ketter Sum Holdings.

273
00:11:50,238 --> 00:11:52,388
They sued the lawyers
bringing class actions

274
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:54,690
against their artificial knees
in order to scare them off.

275
00:11:54,692 --> 00:11:56,192
There might be more.

276
00:11:56,194 --> 00:11:58,227
I think Patti is using
this suit to fact-find.

277
00:11:58,229 --> 00:11:59,412
- For an appeal?
- Yes.

278
00:11:59,414 --> 00:12:00,729
Look who they're deposing.

279
00:12:00,731 --> 00:12:01,998
Kalinda, me.

280
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,533
Patti doesn't have enough,

281
00:12:03,535 --> 00:12:06,452
so she's using this suit to find
out if we did anything wrong.

282
00:12:06,454 --> 00:12:08,037
I wish I could agree,

283
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:09,539
but if the law
taught me anything,

284
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:12,908
it's that never,
ever trust a man with a limp.

285
00:12:13,877 --> 00:12:15,878
Look, if they want
to find out more

286
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,714
about our tactics,
we turn it back on them.

287
00:12:18,716 --> 00:12:20,933
Right, every time they ask a
question, ask for more detail.

288
00:12:20,935 --> 00:12:23,052
What did you mean by that?

289
00:12:23,054 --> 00:12:24,086
Can you explain?

290
00:12:24,088 --> 00:12:25,388
Good. Anything else?

291
00:12:28,393 --> 00:12:30,359
- Sorry.
- Okay,

292
00:12:30,361 --> 00:12:32,528
I will sit in with Will;
Who do we have for Kalinda?

293
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:34,430
Most of our litigators
were in on this.

294
00:12:34,432 --> 00:12:36,432
So, they're all subject
to being called.

295
00:12:36,934 --> 00:12:39,202
All but one.

296
00:12:40,204 --> 00:12:43,271
Miss Sharma, have you ever
misrepresented your occupation

297
00:12:43,273 --> 00:12:45,224
in order to interview
a witness?

298
00:12:45,726 --> 00:12:48,427
Could you be more specific?

299
00:12:48,429 --> 00:12:50,212
Sure.

300
00:12:50,214 --> 00:12:52,748
Have you ever misrepresented
your occupation

301
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,282
in order to interview a witness,

302
00:12:54,284 --> 00:12:55,918
as you did with my wife

303
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,652
to get into my house?

304
00:12:56,654 --> 00:12:58,237
Objection, what
does that have to do

305
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,689
- with the Veriscene case?
- Well, Miss Sharma

306
00:12:59,691 --> 00:13:01,790
claims she's never broken
the law in pursuit of a case.

307
00:13:01,792 --> 00:13:05,094
I have firsthand knowledge
of such law-breaking.

308
00:13:05,096 --> 00:13:07,463
So, Miss Sharma, can you
please answer the question?

309
00:13:10,184 --> 00:13:12,518
Could you repeat the question?

310
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,570
Sure. Were you Kalinda
Sharma's direct supervisor?

311
00:13:14,572 --> 00:13:17,106
We don't have
direct supervisors here.

312
00:13:17,108 --> 00:13:19,442
Did you tell her to investigate
on the Veriscene case?

313
00:13:19,444 --> 00:13:20,927
In what way, "investigate"?

314
00:13:22,812 --> 00:13:24,280
Okay, Will.

315
00:13:24,282 --> 00:13:25,498
I get it.

316
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,316
We can do this all day.

317
00:13:27,318 --> 00:13:28,417
You obfuscate,

318
00:13:28,419 --> 00:13:29,869
I pull the judge out of court,

319
00:13:29,871 --> 00:13:32,205
he raps you one the knuckles
for being unresponsive,

320
00:13:32,207 --> 00:13:34,323
and all you've done
is waste half a day.

321
00:13:34,325 --> 00:13:35,875
I take exception
to your suggestion

322
00:13:35,877 --> 00:13:37,126
that we're wasting anything.

323
00:13:37,128 --> 00:13:38,511
But remember,

324
00:13:38,513 --> 00:13:41,430
I'm not the one with a balloon
payment due on his office.

325
00:13:44,334 --> 00:13:46,102
Oops.

326
00:13:46,104 --> 00:13:49,005
Was that the elephant
in the room?

327
00:13:57,013 --> 00:13:58,064
Hello.

328
00:13:58,066 --> 00:14:00,199
<i>AN:
You were gonna get back to me.</i>

329
00:14:00,201 --> 00:14:01,651
I... Who is this?

330
00:14:01,653 --> 00:14:02,735
<i>F&E Construction.</i>

331
00:14:04,237 --> 00:14:06,038
<i>You wanted me
to reissue a check.</i>

332
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,574
Yes, I did.

333
00:14:08,576 --> 00:14:10,526
I said I'd get back to you,
though.

334
00:14:10,528 --> 00:14:12,879
<i>I know, but you didn't.</i>

335
00:14:12,881 --> 00:14:15,498
<i>So I decided to call you.</i>

336
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,135
Okay, um, let me get all
my ducks in a row, sir,

337
00:14:19,137 --> 00:14:21,387
and I'll get back to you.

338
00:14:21,389 --> 00:14:22,672
Sir?

339
00:14:22,674 --> 00:14:24,391
<i>No, you won't.</i>

340
00:14:25,393 --> 00:14:27,260
Excuse me?

341
00:14:27,262 --> 00:14:28,844
<i>You won't call me back.</i>

342
00:14:28,846 --> 00:14:31,647
<i>You have no intention
of calling me back.</i>

343
00:14:32,349 --> 00:14:34,650
I said I would, and so I...

344
00:14:34,652 --> 00:14:36,652
Actually, um,

345
00:14:37,154 --> 00:14:38,821
I think we're done here.

346
00:14:39,723 --> 00:14:41,089
<i>No, we're not.</i>

347
00:14:44,527 --> 00:14:46,078
<i>Could you be more specific?</i>

348
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,780
Did you introduce judges

349
00:14:47,782 --> 00:14:50,233
to bookies at your Wednesday
night basketball...

350
00:14:50,235 --> 00:14:51,584
Objection, relevance.

351
00:14:51,586 --> 00:14:53,869
Isn't Judge Wynter relevant?

352
00:14:53,871 --> 00:14:55,621
The man who awarded
you $25 million?

353
00:14:55,623 --> 00:14:56,872
Isn't he one of the judges

354
00:14:56,874 --> 00:14:58,240
you introduced to bookies?

355
00:14:58,242 --> 00:14:59,842
Objection.
And weren't you confronted

356
00:14:59,844 --> 00:15:01,127
about this at the grand jury?

357
00:15:01,129 --> 00:15:02,878
Excuse me, Ms. Nyholm,

358
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,380
you have referenced proceedings

359
00:15:04,382 --> 00:15:06,081
that resulted
in a sealed transcript.

360
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:09,101
Yes, but Mr. Gardner can
answer to his own testimony.

361
00:15:09,103 --> 00:15:10,603
This question requires
your knowledge

362
00:15:10,605 --> 00:15:11,804
of the grand jury investigation.

363
00:15:11,806 --> 00:15:13,439
No, it merely requires
Mr. Gardner's knowledge

364
00:15:13,441 --> 00:15:15,758
of the grand jury
investigation.

365
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,926
All right, we're taking this
to the judge.

366
00:15:21,198 --> 00:15:23,316
Okay, okay, okay.

367
00:15:23,318 --> 00:15:25,034
You are all new to me,

368
00:15:25,036 --> 00:15:27,403
so my apologies if I need
to be reminded of your names,

369
00:15:27,405 --> 00:15:28,537
but Ms.--

370
00:15:28,539 --> 00:15:30,373
Lockhart.
You are arguing

371
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:32,992
the only way these questions
could be asked

372
00:15:32,994 --> 00:15:35,795
is if they were taken
from sealed transcripts?

373
00:15:35,797 --> 00:15:37,380
Yes, Your Honor,
someone is leaking them

374
00:15:37,382 --> 00:15:38,798
grand jury testimony,

375
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,384
and we would argue this
line of questioning

376
00:15:41,386 --> 00:15:43,619
should be stricken.

377
00:15:46,423 --> 00:15:49,725
If I may interject, Your Honor,
we're merely asking questions

378
00:15:49,727 --> 00:15:51,427
based on our own knowledge.

379
00:15:51,429 --> 00:15:53,145
And if you can allow me
an explanation,

380
00:15:53,147 --> 00:15:54,730
these movements that you see,

381
00:15:54,732 --> 00:15:56,015
uh, these random movements,

382
00:15:56,017 --> 00:15:57,350
they're the consequence
of a neurological disorder

383
00:15:57,352 --> 00:16:00,853
I suffer from called
tardive dyskinesia.

384
00:16:02,072 --> 00:16:03,823
And I just didn't want you

385
00:16:03,825 --> 00:16:06,141
to misinterpret
any of movements.

386
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:07,526
Okay, I won't.

387
00:16:08,862 --> 00:16:10,363
I've had this condition
since childhood.

388
00:16:10,365 --> 00:16:12,815
Are you going somewhere
with this, Mr. Canning? - No,

389
00:16:12,817 --> 00:16:15,284
- I just wanted to explain.
- Okay, thanks.

390
00:16:15,286 --> 00:16:17,003
I will allow these
questions to proceed.

391
00:16:17,005 --> 00:16:18,421
Your Honor...

392
00:16:18,423 --> 00:16:20,790
But if you produce evidence
these questions are based

393
00:16:20,792 --> 00:16:22,875
on sealed grand jury evidence,

394
00:16:22,877 --> 00:16:25,261
I will exclude
all such testimony

395
00:16:25,263 --> 00:16:26,962
from this suit.

396
00:16:26,964 --> 00:16:29,181
We need to get Kalinda
to follow Patti and find out

397
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:31,067
who's leaking this grand
jury testimony. - No.

398
00:16:32,719 --> 00:16:34,520
We need to talk settlement.

399
00:16:36,222 --> 00:16:37,990
Will, we're vulnerable.

400
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:40,509
No, we're not.

401
00:16:41,111 --> 00:16:42,177
There's nothing there.

402
00:16:42,179 --> 00:16:44,146
But what is there
doesn't look good.

403
00:16:44,148 --> 00:16:45,981
You played
basketball with him,

404
00:16:45,983 --> 00:16:47,283
you introduced him

405
00:16:47,285 --> 00:16:49,318
to a bookie, and he awarded us

406
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,987
seven million above our ask.

407
00:16:53,189 --> 00:16:55,207
Here's what I suggest.

408
00:16:55,209 --> 00:16:56,709
We offer to drop the
Veriscene class action.

409
00:16:57,411 --> 00:16:59,598
It's what they
want, anyway.

410
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:03,698
- Damn it.
- I know, but it's the smart move.

411
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,000
We need to get
this behind us.

412
00:17:05,002 --> 00:17:07,837
This balloon payment,
our clients...

413
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,005
Patric Edelstein
is making noise.

414
00:17:10,007 --> 00:17:12,641
I mean, he's 20%
of our quarter.

415
00:17:12,643 --> 00:17:15,344
Everything's falling
apart as we fight this.

416
00:17:16,646 --> 00:17:18,481
Uh, do you want me...

417
00:17:18,483 --> 00:17:20,483
No, it's all right,
we've just been...

418
00:17:20,485 --> 00:17:23,018
riding close to the edge
this whole year.

419
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:24,103
It's not for anyone to know.

420
00:17:24,105 --> 00:17:25,554
I understand.

421
00:17:28,692 --> 00:17:29,909
Okay.

422
00:17:29,911 --> 00:17:31,560
Let's make this go away.

423
00:17:35,198 --> 00:17:36,665
They brought
out the buffet.

424
00:17:36,667 --> 00:17:38,250
This must be serious.

425
00:17:38,752 --> 00:17:40,669
You drop the lawsuit,

426
00:17:40,671 --> 00:17:42,237
and we drop the
Veriscene class action.

427
00:17:42,239 --> 00:17:44,740
That's our offer;
Take it or leave it.

428
00:17:45,742 --> 00:17:46,909
Fruit?

429
00:17:46,911 --> 00:17:48,427
Please.

430
00:17:49,096 --> 00:17:51,764
Uh, no.

431
00:17:51,766 --> 00:17:53,215
- But thank you.
- Don't you want

432
00:17:53,217 --> 00:17:54,249
to take it back to your client?

433
00:17:54,251 --> 00:17:56,102
No. We're not caving
on the appeal.

434
00:17:56,104 --> 00:17:57,686
- We know.
- You have no case.

435
00:17:57,688 --> 00:18:00,055
- Not without some grand jury leak.
- You don't understand.

436
00:18:00,057 --> 00:18:01,607
This isn't about a case.

437
00:18:01,609 --> 00:18:03,442
You-you want to tell them?

438
00:18:03,444 --> 00:18:04,593
No, no.

439
00:18:04,595 --> 00:18:06,445
You're much better
at the nasty stuff.

440
00:18:06,447 --> 00:18:08,864
We're not here to settle.

441
00:18:08,866 --> 00:18:10,716
We're here to destroy you.

442
00:18:11,852 --> 00:18:14,269
Our clients are tired
of being sued by you.

443
00:18:14,271 --> 00:18:16,438
Four class actions in two years?

444
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,040
They've taken it personally.

445
00:18:18,042 --> 00:18:19,575
Look at you.

446
00:18:19,577 --> 00:18:21,326
- Hi, boo-boo.
- They've set aside

447
00:18:21,328 --> 00:18:23,212
a large sum of money to
put you out of business.

448
00:18:23,214 --> 00:18:25,414
That's why we're here,
to make an example of you.

449
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:27,299
You've seen <i>Butch Cassidy
and the Sundance Kid.</i>

450
00:18:27,301 --> 00:18:29,502
We're the Super-posse.

451
00:18:29,504 --> 00:18:31,170
So, thank you for the offer,

452
00:18:31,172 --> 00:18:32,588
but no.

453
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:35,057
We're getting paid a lot of
money to make you go bankrupt.

454
00:18:35,059 --> 00:18:36,625
Thank you for the fruit, though.

455
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,428
Peanut.

456
00:18:41,899 --> 00:18:44,166
Hello, hello.

457
00:19:28,129 --> 00:19:30,330
Hi. That's pretty.

458
00:19:54,405 --> 00:19:56,490
Well, Kalinda,
funny seeing you here.

459
00:19:56,492 --> 00:19:59,309
Yeah, almost as funny
as seeing you here,

460
00:19:59,311 --> 00:20:02,279
with Ms. Nyholm, leaking
grand jury testimony.

461
00:20:02,281 --> 00:20:03,864
Mr. Wiley
is legally sharing

462
00:20:03,866 --> 00:20:06,500
his <i>own</i> testimony
before the grand jury.

463
00:20:06,502 --> 00:20:08,369
- Really?
- Yeah, the state's attorney

464
00:20:08,371 --> 00:20:11,038
wasn't interested in pursuing
the case against Will Gardner.

465
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,173
Ms. Nyholm is.

466
00:20:12,175 --> 00:20:14,158
And our kids love
playing together.

467
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,977
So it's all
perfectly legal.

468
00:20:22,433 --> 00:20:23,500
Hi.

469
00:20:23,502 --> 00:20:26,887
Cary, we're having some trouble
with Andrew Wiley,

470
00:20:26,889 --> 00:20:29,173
an investigator from
the state's attorney's office.

471
00:20:29,175 --> 00:20:31,058
- Yes, I know him.
- He's the one working

472
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:32,342
with Nyholm and Canning.

473
00:20:32,944 --> 00:20:34,728
I doubt that.

474
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:37,097
Wiley doesn't break the rules.

475
00:20:38,099 --> 00:20:40,284
Unless he's using
his own testimony.

476
00:20:40,286 --> 00:20:42,519
Yep. So we need
something from you.

477
00:20:42,521 --> 00:20:44,455
Well, you know that
I can't share what I know

478
00:20:44,457 --> 00:20:46,157
about the grand jury
because that would be unethical.

479
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:47,124
Yes, but you

480
00:20:47,126 --> 00:20:49,860
can use your knowledge
in another way.

481
00:20:54,199 --> 00:20:56,667
Thank you for coming.

482
00:20:56,669 --> 00:20:58,702
It means so much to me.

483
00:20:58,704 --> 00:21:00,404
I didn't come here
to visit, Jackie.

484
00:21:00,406 --> 00:21:03,324
I came to recommend
that you retain a lawyer.

485
00:21:03,326 --> 00:21:05,226
You... Why?

486
00:21:05,228 --> 00:21:06,494
You took money

487
00:21:06,496 --> 00:21:09,113
from my children's trust
so that you could outbid me

488
00:21:09,115 --> 00:21:11,048
on my family home.

489
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:12,766
I intend to sue you.

490
00:21:14,853 --> 00:21:17,154
I'm sorry, Alicia.

491
00:21:17,156 --> 00:21:20,858
This family's been
through so much, and I...

492
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:23,327
I thought I knew best.

493
00:21:23,329 --> 00:21:25,496
I'm so sorry.

494
00:21:26,665 --> 00:21:28,165
Jackie, please.

495
00:21:28,167 --> 00:21:29,399
What do you want?

496
00:21:29,401 --> 00:21:32,119
I want you to
accept my apology.

497
00:21:32,121 --> 00:21:34,388
- No, you don't.
- I want to make things right.

498
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:35,840
It'll be good

499
00:21:35,842 --> 00:21:38,742
for Zach and Grace
and... and Peter.

500
00:21:43,015 --> 00:21:44,598
You want Peter to win.

501
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,583
That's what you want.

502
00:21:46,585 --> 00:21:48,552
Eli was here, wasn't he?

503
00:21:48,554 --> 00:21:51,188
I-I-I don't know.

504
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:53,107
I...

505
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:01,065
He...

506
00:22:01,067 --> 00:22:03,751
He can't do it without you.

507
00:22:08,273 --> 00:22:10,207
Here's what I want, Jackie.

508
00:22:10,209 --> 00:22:12,442
You sign the house
over to the kids,

509
00:22:12,444 --> 00:22:15,596
you put it in their names,
I won't sue.

510
00:22:24,388 --> 00:22:26,941
You want me to accept your
apology, show me you mean it.

511
00:22:27,643 --> 00:22:29,977
Sign the house over to the kids.

512
00:22:34,684 --> 00:22:35,799
Excuse me.

513
00:22:35,801 --> 00:22:37,434
Watch your toes.

514
00:22:37,436 --> 00:22:40,988
Everyone, please,
indoor voices.

515
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:43,157
Your Honor, like you, I look at
life a little differently--

516
00:22:43,159 --> 00:22:44,158
with a little more caution,

517
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,110
- a little more quiet.
- Why like me?

518
00:22:46,112 --> 00:22:47,077
I'm sorry, I...

519
00:22:47,079 --> 00:22:48,279
You said "like me."

520
00:22:48,281 --> 00:22:49,330
What do you mean?

521
00:22:49,332 --> 00:22:50,614
What we mean, Your Honor,

522
00:22:50,616 --> 00:22:52,482
is that the defense's motion
is a desperate ploy

523
00:22:52,484 --> 00:22:53,584
to avoid
responsibility.

524
00:22:53,586 --> 00:22:54,952
Mr. Canning asked

525
00:22:54,954 --> 00:22:56,670
Ms. Sharma one question
that couldn't have been

526
00:22:56,672 --> 00:22:58,289
in Mr. Wiley's
grand jury testimony,

527
00:22:58,291 --> 00:22:59,990
Your Honor.

528
00:22:59,992 --> 00:23:02,492
The $2,000 in cash
Mr. Gardner gave to a judge--

529
00:23:02,494 --> 00:23:04,011
money that was supposedly
for UNICEF.

530
00:23:04,013 --> 00:23:05,496
<i>Was</i> for UNICEF.

531
00:23:05,498 --> 00:23:06,496
This was evidence that Mr. Wiley

532
00:23:06,498 --> 00:23:07,548
personally witnessed,
Your Honor.

533
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:08,665
Yes, but the question isn't

534
00:23:08,667 --> 00:23:10,050
whether he personally
witnessed it or not.

535
00:23:10,852 --> 00:23:13,854
Andrew, did you testify to it
or did you witness it?

536
00:23:13,856 --> 00:23:16,390
Wait a minute, you can't
talk to our client.

537
00:23:16,392 --> 00:23:17,942
Andrew, which one did you do?

538
00:23:17,944 --> 00:23:19,693
- Oh, my God.
- Andrew, no, stop right there!

539
00:23:19,695 --> 00:23:20,677
He's right, I just

540
00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:22,646
- witnessed it.
- Due to this admission,

541
00:23:22,648 --> 00:23:24,514
Your Honor, all the evidence
regarding Mr. Gardner's

542
00:23:24,516 --> 00:23:27,151
bribing of a judge
should be excluded.

543
00:23:27,153 --> 00:23:28,685
Your Honor, I'd like
to add another name

544
00:23:28,687 --> 00:23:30,671
to our witness list:
Alicia Florrick.

545
00:23:34,492 --> 00:23:36,860
I have to
witness prep you.

546
00:23:36,862 --> 00:23:38,162
They're coming
after you,

547
00:23:38,164 --> 00:23:41,498
trying to get to Will
bribing judges another way.

548
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,667
I know.

549
00:23:45,536 --> 00:23:47,237
F&E Construction.

550
00:23:50,091 --> 00:23:52,259
What is it?

551
00:23:54,062 --> 00:23:55,312
Why?

552
00:23:55,314 --> 00:23:58,065
I found a check
in your file from Canada.

553
00:23:58,067 --> 00:24:00,184
An un-cashed check from 2007.

554
00:24:00,186 --> 00:24:01,986
Yeah. That-that shouldn't
be there.

555
00:24:01,988 --> 00:24:03,720
That should be
in my personal file.

556
00:24:03,722 --> 00:24:05,389
It's for $21,000.

557
00:24:05,391 --> 00:24:07,324
That would go a long way
to pay your tax bill.

558
00:24:07,326 --> 00:24:09,376
I know.
Do you have the check?

559
00:24:11,412 --> 00:24:13,080
Thanks.

560
00:24:13,082 --> 00:24:14,748
It's-it's complicated.

561
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:16,583
I called the number on it.

562
00:24:19,454 --> 00:24:21,255
As part of your tax work,

563
00:24:21,257 --> 00:24:24,758
I called employers
for updated checks.

564
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,093
When?

565
00:24:26,095 --> 00:24:27,511
When did I call? Tuesday.

566
00:24:27,513 --> 00:24:30,180
Did you speak to anyone?

567
00:24:30,182 --> 00:24:31,131
Yes.

568
00:24:31,133 --> 00:24:32,416
Who?

569
00:24:32,418 --> 00:24:33,517
I don't know.

570
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:34,852
He wouldn't
give me his name.

571
00:24:34,854 --> 00:24:36,637
He asked for the number
on your check.

572
00:24:36,639 --> 00:24:37,721
Did you give it?

573
00:24:39,423 --> 00:24:40,541
No.

574
00:24:42,827 --> 00:24:43,927
Thanks.

575
00:24:44,879 --> 00:24:46,596
He called me back.

576
00:24:51,452 --> 00:24:53,136
What's going on, Kalinda?

577
00:24:53,638 --> 00:24:56,190
It's just something
from an old thing.

578
00:24:56,442 --> 00:24:57,708
"An old thing"?

579
00:24:58,210 --> 00:24:59,576
Is it Lemond Bishop?

580
00:24:59,578 --> 00:25:01,612
No. I'm gonna go
and take care of it.

581
00:25:01,614 --> 00:25:02,580
Kalinda.

582
00:25:03,582 --> 00:25:05,682
Yeah?

583
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:09,586
Nothing.

584
00:25:09,588 --> 00:25:10,837
I'll be back.

585
00:25:10,839 --> 00:25:12,839
I'm-I'm gonna go
take care of it.

586
00:25:43,922 --> 00:25:45,706
That might be
too big for you.

587
00:25:45,708 --> 00:25:47,691
I've got some lighter
ones around the corner.

588
00:25:47,693 --> 00:25:48,909
No, this one's fine.

589
00:25:48,911 --> 00:25:50,127
You sure?

590
00:25:50,379 --> 00:25:52,579
You need anything else,
let me know.

591
00:26:25,997 --> 00:26:27,815
♪ ♪

592
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:58,111
♪ ♪

593
00:27:29,003 --> 00:27:30,921
And it's not just
the sink, the shower, too.

594
00:27:30,923 --> 00:27:33,407
Okay, I'll call down,
but we're probably on our own.

595
00:27:33,409 --> 00:27:35,692
They go out of their
way not to fix things

596
00:27:35,694 --> 00:27:38,144
when they're converting to
condos, so it forces you to buy.

597
00:27:38,146 --> 00:27:39,864
Are you gonna?

598
00:27:39,966 --> 00:27:41,699
Buy?

599
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:43,534
I don't know.

600
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:46,837
I like it here,
but maybe there's better.

601
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:48,822
Dad wants you
to buy the house.

602
00:27:48,824 --> 00:27:50,591
- He...
- He told you

603
00:27:50,593 --> 00:27:52,659
he wanted to sell it,
didn't he?

604
00:27:52,661 --> 00:27:53,594
Would you?

605
00:27:53,596 --> 00:27:55,212
- Buy the house?
- Yeah.

606
00:27:55,214 --> 00:27:56,680
No.
Why not?

607
00:27:56,682 --> 00:27:57,715
You were going to.

608
00:27:57,717 --> 00:27:58,716
I know, but everything's

609
00:27:58,718 --> 00:27:59,800
up in the air right now.

610
00:27:59,802 --> 00:28:01,435
You got a raise.

611
00:28:01,437 --> 00:28:03,437
Yes. But sometimes
getting a raise

612
00:28:03,439 --> 00:28:05,389
means that you cost more,
so when they're looking

613
00:28:05,391 --> 00:28:08,025
to downsize, it's easier to
fire you than someone cheaper.

614
00:28:08,027 --> 00:28:09,360
And they're
looking to downsize?

615
00:28:09,362 --> 00:28:12,029
No, but we're just going
through a bad spell.

616
00:28:12,031 --> 00:28:13,397
You should move in.

617
00:28:13,399 --> 00:28:17,351
We should all
live in one house.

618
00:28:17,353 --> 00:28:19,403
What?

619
00:28:19,405 --> 00:28:21,539
Not like you guys
are married.

620
00:28:21,541 --> 00:28:23,040
Like a commune.

621
00:28:23,042 --> 00:28:24,024
Hmm.

622
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:28,579
I've kind of grown
to like you.

623
00:28:28,581 --> 00:28:30,247
Yeah? Not Zach?

624
00:28:30,249 --> 00:28:31,365
No, not Zach.

625
00:28:31,367 --> 00:28:32,500
He's getting too big.

626
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:34,385
Hey.

627
00:28:36,088 --> 00:28:37,421
You shouldn't
answer it.

628
00:28:37,423 --> 00:28:38,973
It's probably work.

629
00:28:38,975 --> 00:28:41,008
They can't fire you
if they can't find you.

630
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:42,343
Very funny.

631
00:28:48,884 --> 00:28:49,850
Hello?

632
00:28:49,852 --> 00:28:52,886
<i>AN:
Alicia Florrick?</i>

633
00:28:54,223 --> 00:28:55,656
Is it work?

634
00:28:55,658 --> 00:28:57,858
No. Wrong number.

635
00:29:06,084 --> 00:29:08,002
<i>This is Kalinda.
Please leave a message.</i>

636
00:29:12,706 --> 00:29:13,824
<i>You ready for this?</i>

637
00:29:13,826 --> 00:29:16,043
- I hope so.
- Don't worry, it'll all be about me.

638
00:29:16,045 --> 00:29:17,077
Just tell the truth.

639
00:29:18,931 --> 00:29:20,231
Have you seen Kalinda?

640
00:29:20,233 --> 00:29:21,248
No, why?

641
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:22,416
She's not in today.

642
00:29:22,418 --> 00:29:24,385
She's probably
just late.

643
00:29:24,887 --> 00:29:26,520
<i>You were second chair</i>

644
00:29:26,522 --> 00:29:29,056
on the Veriscene case,
right, Mrs. Florrick?

645
00:29:29,558 --> 00:29:30,357
Yes.

646
00:29:30,359 --> 00:29:32,059
Did you have
ex parte communication

647
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:33,744
with Judge Wynter
during the trial?

648
00:29:33,746 --> 00:29:35,412
- No.
- And you have no personal

649
00:29:35,414 --> 00:29:37,114
- relationship with Judge Wynter?
- That's correct.

650
00:29:38,116 --> 00:29:39,766
But someone you know does?

651
00:29:40,268 --> 00:29:42,268
You mean Will?

652
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:42,969
No.

653
00:29:43,471 --> 00:29:44,955
I mean your husband.

654
00:29:46,107 --> 00:29:47,274
Peter Florrick.

655
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:50,944
I-I have no idea.

656
00:29:51,046 --> 00:29:51,996
You have no idea whether

657
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:53,831
your husband has a personal
relationship with Judge Wynter?

658
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:55,115
I mean, I know that

659
00:29:55,117 --> 00:29:56,617
he knows him, but I don't know

660
00:29:56,619 --> 00:29:58,085
the extent of
their relationship.

661
00:29:58,087 --> 00:29:59,553
Did you know that your husband

662
00:29:59,555 --> 00:30:01,255
met with Judge Wynter
three times

663
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:05,259
in the week leading up to
the Veriscene verdict?

664
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:06,760
- No.
- Really?

665
00:30:06,762 --> 00:30:09,029
On the eve of Judge Wynter's
decision to award you

666
00:30:09,031 --> 00:30:12,933
$25 million, your husband
met with him three times,

667
00:30:12,935 --> 00:30:14,985
- and you had no idea?
- That's correct.

668
00:30:14,987 --> 00:30:16,420
Are we working
off the assumption

669
00:30:16,422 --> 00:30:18,656
they did, in fact, meet?
How do we know this?

670
00:30:18,658 --> 00:30:20,924
Because we're going
to subpoena Peter Florrick.

671
00:30:22,661 --> 00:30:25,362
You're going to
subpoena the state's attorney?

672
00:30:25,364 --> 00:30:27,147
We already have.

673
00:30:32,871 --> 00:30:36,040
Hold the door, please.

674
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:37,791
Thanks.

675
00:30:37,793 --> 00:30:39,543
No problem. 28th?

676
00:30:39,545 --> 00:30:41,762
Yeah.

677
00:31:00,013 --> 00:31:02,282
So, you seeing Alicia?

678
00:31:02,284 --> 00:31:04,184
Am I seeing Alicia?

679
00:31:04,686 --> 00:31:06,369
No, actually, I'm being deposed.

680
00:31:06,371 --> 00:31:07,520
Oh. Really?

681
00:31:07,522 --> 00:31:08,822
Although it
occurred to me

682
00:31:08,824 --> 00:31:10,690
I've never seen
where Alicia works.

683
00:31:10,692 --> 00:31:12,859
Does she know
you're coming?

684
00:31:12,861 --> 00:31:16,379
Not that it matters
either way.

685
00:31:16,381 --> 00:31:18,081
I don't know.

686
00:31:18,583 --> 00:31:21,168
So you must be looking forward
to getting back to the law, huh?

687
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:22,669
I am.

688
00:31:22,671 --> 00:31:25,222
I think convicts
call it "short time."

689
00:31:25,224 --> 00:31:26,423
Really?

690
00:31:26,425 --> 00:31:28,608
I never did.

691
00:31:36,701 --> 00:31:39,269
Well, hi.

692
00:31:39,271 --> 00:31:40,604
Hi.

693
00:31:40,606 --> 00:31:42,272
Look who I found.

694
00:31:42,274 --> 00:31:44,024
Yes. Welcome.

695
00:31:44,026 --> 00:31:45,909
I thought I would come
and meet you.

696
00:31:45,911 --> 00:31:46,860
Which one?

697
00:31:46,862 --> 00:31:49,412
You, Peter.

698
00:31:49,414 --> 00:31:50,747
Thought you might want
to see my office.

699
00:31:50,749 --> 00:31:52,332
-Hello, Eli.
- Yeah.

700
00:31:52,334 --> 00:31:54,751
I...

701
00:31:54,753 --> 00:31:56,236
Hi.

702
00:31:56,238 --> 00:31:57,754
H-Hello, everyone.

703
00:31:57,756 --> 00:31:59,956
Hi. I was just

704
00:31:59,958 --> 00:32:01,241
showing Peter my office.

705
00:32:01,243 --> 00:32:02,876
He's here
for a deposition.

706
00:32:02,878 --> 00:32:04,261
Really?

707
00:32:04,263 --> 00:32:06,546
Good. Great.

708
00:32:06,548 --> 00:32:07,514
Cary.

709
00:32:07,516 --> 00:32:08,965
- Hey, Cary.
- Hello.

710
00:32:08,967 --> 00:32:10,884
Hello, Mr. Florrick.
How you doing?

711
00:32:10,886 --> 00:32:11,968
- Hey, how you guys doing?
- Hi.

712
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:13,253
So how's it going here?

713
00:32:13,255 --> 00:32:14,638
At Lockhart-Gardner? It's good.

714
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,589
I mean, I loved the state's
attorney's office,

715
00:32:16,591 --> 00:32:18,608
but there's a lot
of smart people here, too.

716
00:32:22,697 --> 00:32:24,597
One of our new
associates.

717
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,202
Hey, Kalinda.

718
00:32:30,538 --> 00:32:32,906
It's a surprise
party for you.

719
00:32:32,908 --> 00:32:36,493
I'm impressed.

720
00:32:36,495 --> 00:32:39,129
What you have done
in three years is amazing.

721
00:32:39,131 --> 00:32:40,747
Thank you.

722
00:32:40,749 --> 00:32:41,798
Okay.

723
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:44,617
I guess I should go
meet my executioners.

724
00:32:44,619 --> 00:32:46,586
Oh, Peter, you didn't
have to do this.

725
00:32:46,588 --> 00:32:47,804
You could've blown it off.

726
00:32:47,806 --> 00:32:49,122
It's a stupid nuisance suit.

727
00:32:49,124 --> 00:32:51,224
I wanted to get out
and stretch my legs.

728
00:32:51,226 --> 00:32:53,426
Hey. Come over tonight.

729
00:32:53,428 --> 00:32:55,461
- I'll have to work.
- Just to see the house.

730
00:32:55,463 --> 00:32:57,314
- Stay for five minutes, tops.
- I wish I could.

731
00:32:57,816 --> 00:32:59,983
Peter?

732
00:32:59,985 --> 00:33:01,467
Have you checked in
on Jackie lately?

733
00:33:01,469 --> 00:33:02,652
Have I?

734
00:33:02,654 --> 00:33:04,070
Yeah. Why?

735
00:33:04,072 --> 00:33:05,188
I'm worried.

736
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:06,606
She seems confused.

737
00:33:06,608 --> 00:33:09,109
She's getting older.

738
00:33:10,111 --> 00:33:11,278
Hey...

739
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,663
congratulations.

740
00:33:14,782 --> 00:33:16,433
You made it.

741
00:33:27,344 --> 00:33:28,928
You need money?

742
00:33:28,930 --> 00:33:31,931
Just an advance
on the work so far.

743
00:33:31,933 --> 00:33:34,217
Why?

744
00:33:36,721 --> 00:33:38,171
Kalinda, what's going on?

745
00:33:38,173 --> 00:33:40,307
I-I have to go.

746
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:43,343
You have to... Why?

747
00:33:43,845 --> 00:33:45,562
I thought you were
liking it here.

748
00:33:46,214 --> 00:33:47,731
I am liking it here.

749
00:33:47,733 --> 00:33:49,349
Okay, then you
would understand

750
00:33:49,351 --> 00:33:51,868
my confusion.

751
00:33:56,255 --> 00:33:57,357
Look...

752
00:33:57,359 --> 00:33:59,042
we're in a bit of trouble.

753
00:33:59,044 --> 00:34:01,361
We're short
on receivables.

754
00:34:01,363 --> 00:34:03,630
Patric Edelstein
is delaying his monthly,

755
00:34:03,632 --> 00:34:06,599
and we have some long-term suits
that haven't paid out yet.

756
00:34:07,518 --> 00:34:09,369
I can get you some.

757
00:34:09,371 --> 00:34:11,171
Not everything.

758
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:15,558
Okay.

759
00:34:17,228 --> 00:34:18,378
This is good-bye?

760
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:20,230
Just for a little bit.

761
00:34:20,732 --> 00:34:23,382
You're gonna make me cry.

762
00:34:25,001 --> 00:34:26,236
I don't know.

763
00:34:26,738 --> 00:34:29,823
It feels like things
are falling apart.

764
00:34:29,825 --> 00:34:33,343
You'll build them up again,
that's what you do.

765
00:34:48,788 --> 00:34:50,006
And you met with
Judge Wynter three times

766
00:34:50,008 --> 00:34:52,724
before this last Thursday,
the day of the verdict?

767
00:34:52,726 --> 00:34:53,425
Yes.

768
00:34:53,427 --> 00:34:55,010
Is that a lot for you?

769
00:34:55,913 --> 00:34:58,747
- Yeah  - In fact, before these
three meetings,

770
00:34:58,749 --> 00:35:00,633
you had only
met him once...

771
00:35:00,635 --> 00:35:01,817
in 2008

772
00:35:01,819 --> 00:35:03,552
at a judge's lunch,

773
00:35:03,554 --> 00:35:06,255
with 12 other judges.

774
00:35:06,757 --> 00:35:08,323
Yeah, that sounds
about right.

775
00:35:08,825 --> 00:35:10,326
So why' you meet with him?

776
00:35:10,328 --> 00:35:11,493
Those three times?

777
00:35:12,145 --> 00:35:14,412
I like him.

778
00:35:14,914 --> 00:35:16,665
Did the subject
of your wife's lawsuit

779
00:35:16,667 --> 00:35:17,916
come up
at these meetings?

780
00:35:17,918 --> 00:35:19,317
- No.
- Really?

781
00:35:19,319 --> 00:35:21,487
At the same time you were
meeting with this judge,

782
00:35:21,489 --> 00:35:23,489
your wife had a suit
in front of him,

783
00:35:23,491 --> 00:35:25,323
and the subject never came up?

784
00:35:25,325 --> 00:35:27,309
- That's correct.
- This grand jury investigation

785
00:35:27,311 --> 00:35:29,961
into Will Gardner's
supposed bribing

786
00:35:29,963 --> 00:35:31,796
of three judges,
including Judge Wynters...

787
00:35:31,798 --> 00:35:32,830
Objection.

788
00:35:32,832 --> 00:35:34,516
We are not referring to the content
of that investigation,

789
00:35:35,018 --> 00:35:37,186
just to Mr. Florrick's
supervision of it.

790
00:35:37,188 --> 00:35:38,336
But just to correct you,

791
00:35:38,338 --> 00:35:40,556
uh, Ms. Scott-Carr had
supervision over it. - Yes,

792
00:35:40,558 --> 00:35:41,640
- until you removed her.
- I removed her

793
00:35:41,642 --> 00:35:43,525
because the grand jury
had concluded.

794
00:35:43,527 --> 00:35:45,194
But the state's attorney
can bring charges again?

795
00:35:45,196 --> 00:35:47,012
He can. I chose not to.

796
00:35:47,014 --> 00:35:48,480
You also chose not
to bring charges against

797
00:35:48,482 --> 00:35:50,949
the three judges
involved in this bribery scheme.

798
00:35:50,951 --> 00:35:53,351
The <i>supposed</i>
bribery scheme? Yes.

799
00:35:53,353 --> 00:35:54,686
- Why not?
- I didn't want to.

800
00:35:54,688 --> 00:35:57,522
I thought Ms. Scott-Carr
had gone beyond her directive.

801
00:35:57,524 --> 00:35:59,641
So when you met
with Judge Wynter...

802
00:35:59,643 --> 00:36:01,076
he owed you?

803
00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:04,747
Did you not want to answer?

804
00:36:04,749 --> 00:36:07,182
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know
that was a question.

805
00:36:07,184 --> 00:36:09,534
Didn't you ask
Judge Wynter to decide

806
00:36:09,536 --> 00:36:12,571
this verdict for your wife
as a quid pro quo

807
00:36:12,573 --> 00:36:14,256
- for dropping his investigation?
- No.

808
00:36:14,258 --> 00:36:15,557
But isn't that
a fair conclusion?

809
00:36:15,559 --> 00:36:17,826
- No.
- And how is that?

810
00:36:19,862 --> 00:36:22,264
Because my wife
and I are separated.

811
00:36:25,135 --> 00:36:26,485
Then I...

812
00:36:30,323 --> 00:36:31,373
That is news to me.

813
00:36:32,825 --> 00:36:33,809
Then what other reason

814
00:36:33,811 --> 00:36:35,077
could there be
for these meetings?

815
00:36:35,579 --> 00:36:38,363
His support for my campaign.

816
00:36:40,166 --> 00:36:42,617
So I guess you could accuse me

817
00:36:42,619 --> 00:36:45,754
of being corrupt for myself,

818
00:36:45,756 --> 00:36:47,556
but not for my wife.

819
00:36:54,179 --> 00:36:55,412
How's it going?

820
00:36:55,914 --> 00:36:56,914
Good. You?

821
00:36:56,916 --> 00:36:57,766
Good.

822
00:36:57,768 --> 00:37:00,519
I have to head out.
I just wanted to say good night.

823
00:37:00,521 --> 00:37:02,304
That man who called me,

824
00:37:02,806 --> 00:37:04,306
F&E Construction,

825
00:37:05,608 --> 00:37:06,892
he called me at home,

826
00:37:07,394 --> 00:37:08,894
and he said my name.

827
00:37:11,448 --> 00:37:13,532
- He said your name?
- Yes.

828
00:37:14,534 --> 00:37:15,967
Did you give your name?

829
00:37:16,069 --> 00:37:17,252
No.

830
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:21,073
Kalinda,
who is this man?

831
00:37:21,575 --> 00:37:23,492
We said we would be up front
with each other.

832
00:37:24,244 --> 00:37:25,494
I know.

833
00:37:25,496 --> 00:37:27,412
Is this man dangerous?

834
00:37:29,014 --> 00:37:29,831
Yeah.

835
00:37:30,583 --> 00:37:32,434
Well, who is he?

836
00:37:34,887 --> 00:37:36,438
He's my husband.

837
00:37:39,092 --> 00:37:41,810
Come on.
You don't have anything.

838
00:37:41,812 --> 00:37:43,846
The state's attorney
just told you

839
00:37:44,048 --> 00:37:46,515
there's no way he could have
done this for his wife

840
00:37:46,517 --> 00:37:48,216
because they're separated.

841
00:37:48,218 --> 00:37:51,219
And he's done this with
some considerable expense

842
00:37:51,221 --> 00:37:52,971
to his own political career...

843
00:37:53,973 --> 00:37:56,857
because it's now in the record
that they've separated.

844
00:37:56,859 --> 00:37:58,642
So, what do you have?

845
00:37:58,644 --> 00:37:59,811
A passion to
see this through.

846
00:37:59,813 --> 00:38:03,064
We take back our offer
to drop the class action.

847
00:38:03,066 --> 00:38:05,366
You lost. Face it.

848
00:38:05,368 --> 00:38:06,784
They're right.

849
00:38:06,786 --> 00:38:08,653
We lost.

850
00:38:08,655 --> 00:38:10,238
We should probably
just head out.

851
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,540
You think?

852
00:38:12,542 --> 00:38:14,292
Here's the thing, though.

853
00:38:14,294 --> 00:38:16,360
We were the distraction.

854
00:38:16,362 --> 00:38:18,195
You were the distraction?
What does that mean?

855
00:38:18,197 --> 00:38:21,532
Have you checked on your
top client, Patric Edelstein?

856
00:38:21,534 --> 00:38:23,134
He's no longer your top client.

857
00:38:23,136 --> 00:38:24,219
He's ours.

858
00:38:24,221 --> 00:38:25,753
We just got the text.

859
00:38:25,755 --> 00:38:27,338
He's been unhappy
with Will's suspension,

860
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:30,008
and with your distraction
with this lawsuit.

861
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:31,976
Sleight of hand.
You were watching the right,

862
00:38:31,978 --> 00:38:33,928
you should've been
watching the left.

863
00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:35,430
- Mommy!
- That's right,

864
00:38:35,432 --> 00:38:36,848
we're done here.

865
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:38,716
Mommy's coming home.

866
00:38:38,718 --> 00:38:40,184
After you.

867
00:38:40,186 --> 00:38:41,552
No, no, after you.

868
00:38:41,554 --> 00:38:42,520
Please.

869
00:38:42,522 --> 00:38:44,072
- Mommy!
- Hello!

870
00:38:44,074 --> 00:38:46,241
Let's go. Come on.

871
00:38:46,243 --> 00:38:48,409
Oops.

872
00:38:50,529 --> 00:38:52,730
And it's too late
to call him.

873
00:38:52,732 --> 00:38:54,866
They planned
on that, too.

874
00:38:59,621 --> 00:39:00,738
So...

875
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:02,258
tomorrow?

876
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,377
Tomorrow.

877
00:39:18,274 --> 00:39:20,308
How you doing?

878
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:23,278
Me? I'm, uh...

879
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:25,596
okay.

880
00:39:25,598 --> 00:39:26,781
You?

881
00:39:26,783 --> 00:39:29,284
Same.

882
00:39:29,286 --> 00:39:31,002
That was weird.

883
00:39:31,004 --> 00:39:33,321
With Peter today?

884
00:39:33,323 --> 00:39:35,256
Yes, it was.

885
00:39:50,472 --> 00:39:52,740
Do you think it was a mistake?

886
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:56,728
No.

887
00:40:01,984 --> 00:40:03,918
Good night, Alicia.

888
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,321
Good night, Will.

00:40:43,443 --> 00:40:45,143
How about some wine?

901
00:40:45,145 --> 00:40:47,311
No, I have to get back.

902
00:40:47,897 --> 00:40:49,947
They didn't change much.

903
00:40:49,949 --> 00:40:51,983
The house? Yeah.

904
00:40:51,985 --> 00:40:53,067
They tried to flip it,

905
00:40:53,069 --> 00:40:54,852
but they didn't put
any work into it

906
00:40:54,854 --> 00:40:56,237
so nobody wanted it.

907
00:40:57,823 --> 00:40:59,490
Thanks for today.

908
00:40:59,492 --> 00:41:00,825
I think you stopped
the suit.

909
00:41:02,361 --> 00:41:03,961
I guess I just
told the truth.

00:41:03,963 --> 00:41:05,830
That's bigger than you think.

911
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:09,384
Dad, the pizza's ready.

912
00:41:09,386 --> 00:41:10,668
Okay.

913
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:12,637
- Pizza?
- No, I have to

914
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:16,140
get up early for work tomorrow.
Things are in flux.

915
00:41:16,642 --> 00:41:19,711
When aren't things in flux?

916
00:41:23,065 --> 00:41:25,733
Hey, come say good-bye

have some pizza.
