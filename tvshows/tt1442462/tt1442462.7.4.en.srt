1
00:00:03,838 --> 00:00:08,150
Hello, loyal followers.
It's Alexa, back from Oregon.

2
00:00:08,985 --> 00:00:09,976
(Laughs)

3
00:00:10,006 --> 00:00:12,543
Got to love the Beaver State.

4
00:00:12,573 --> 00:00:17,913
There's trees galore, awesome hiking.

5
00:00:19,216 --> 00:00:20,681
But I went because

6
00:00:20,683 --> 00:00:24,451
of their physician-assisted suicide law.

7
00:00:25,102 --> 00:00:27,203
This brain tumor,

8
00:00:27,233 --> 00:00:30,230
this glioblastoma multiforme...

9
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,627
which sounds like the
worst IKEA piece ever...

10
00:00:33,657 --> 00:00:35,229
it, um...

11
00:00:35,231 --> 00:00:36,697
(Alexa sniffles, coughs)

12
00:00:36,866 --> 00:00:38,664
It just keeps getting worse and worse.

13
00:00:39,562 --> 00:00:42,868
So... I just dined on
some applesauce du jour

14
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:45,771
with broken-up pentobarbital mixed in.

15
00:00:46,114 --> 00:00:48,140
My last supper.

16
00:00:48,496 --> 00:00:50,776
Some gallows humor.

17
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:54,346
I just...

18
00:00:59,156 --> 00:01:01,406
I can't live with the pain anymore.

19
00:01:03,048 --> 00:01:05,724
I don't want to live with
only misery to look forward to.

20
00:01:06,841 --> 00:01:09,891
MAN: You can see why I want this video
excluded from trial, Your Honor.

21
00:01:09,921 --> 00:01:11,736
It is intended to bias the jury.

22
00:01:11,766 --> 00:01:13,614
CANNING: Bias is exactly what
I'm trying to avoid, Your Honor.

23
00:01:13,644 --> 00:01:19,078
The fully-abled have a
bias of-of the blessed.

24
00:01:19,563 --> 00:01:21,095
They can't fathom what
it would be like to have

25
00:01:21,125 --> 00:01:22,997
to make a decision like the
one Alexa Banner had to make.

26
00:01:23,027 --> 00:01:27,849
MAN: And yet, sad as Ms. Banner's
story is, this video has no relevance...

27
00:01:28,743 --> 00:01:30,063
Sorry, Your Honor.

28
00:01:31,014 --> 00:01:33,683
It-it, uh... it is merely an attempt...

29
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:39,021
to... ah.

30
00:01:39,561 --> 00:01:40,523
Here, I...

31
00:01:40,525 --> 00:01:42,171
Look, I can give...

32
00:01:42,201 --> 00:01:43,904
- CANNING: Oh, thank you.
- MAN: Yes.

33
00:01:43,934 --> 00:01:44,830
(Clears throat)

34
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:47,296
Uh, the bottom line is that
what Doctors Pogue

35
00:01:47,298 --> 00:01:49,431
and, uh, Brinton did is illegal.

36
00:01:49,433 --> 00:01:52,033
Hence, this wrongful death suit. State law

37
00:01:52,035 --> 00:01:54,836
is very clear.

38
00:01:55,395 --> 00:01:57,205
Physician...

39
00:01:57,545 --> 00:01:58,973
- Um...
- (Laughing): Your Honor.

40
00:02:01,828 --> 00:02:03,010
Uh...

41
00:02:04,212 --> 00:02:06,414
Uh, physician-assisted...

42
00:02:06,713 --> 00:02:08,749
Um...

43
00:02:09,575 --> 00:02:10,818
suicide.

44
00:02:11,348 --> 00:02:13,007
- It's...
- (Cane clattering)

45
00:02:13,037 --> 00:02:13,947
(Clears his throat)

46
00:02:13,977 --> 00:02:14,927
I, uh...

47
00:02:14,957 --> 00:02:16,424
JUDGE: You were talking about state law,

48
00:02:16,426 --> 00:02:19,570
which you seem to believe is very clear.

49
00:02:20,325 --> 00:02:21,647
- MAN: Thank you.
- Who's winning?

50
00:02:21,677 --> 00:02:23,597
CANNING: Um, my clients
can speak to Alexa's...

51
00:02:23,627 --> 00:02:26,477
- Excuse me?
- Between the two, who's winning?

52
00:02:26,574 --> 00:02:28,665
Uh, I have no idea.

53
00:02:28,695 --> 00:02:30,770
I think you do.

54
00:02:32,949 --> 00:02:34,797
- Do I know you?
- (Cane clatters)

55
00:02:34,827 --> 00:02:36,511
- Your Honor...
- MAN: I don't even think

56
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:38,930
Canning needs those canes.

57
00:02:39,523 --> 00:02:40,555
I think they're props.

58
00:02:40,585 --> 00:02:43,915
Sir, I'm sorry to interrupt,
but I-I have to focus on this.

59
00:02:43,917 --> 00:02:45,547
I know.

60
00:02:45,577 --> 00:02:48,354
I'm Mr. Dipple's general counsel.

61
00:02:48,945 --> 00:02:51,056
Ethan Carver.

62
00:02:52,366 --> 00:02:55,626
- Are you checking up on me?
- No. Him.

63
00:02:55,628 --> 00:02:57,388
The bottom line is that
this wrongful-death suit...

64
00:02:57,418 --> 00:02:59,117
That's why he's fired,

65
00:02:59,147 --> 00:03:00,586
and you're replacing him.

66
00:03:00,616 --> 00:03:02,367
(Cane clatters)

67
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,868
Mr. Dipple assured me

68
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:06,562
that I would not have to argue in court.

69
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,552
What does "AWTTW" mean in a text?

70
00:03:09,582 --> 00:03:12,835
My role was to prep Mr. Oakman
and help him anticipate

71
00:03:12,865 --> 00:03:15,959
what the defense would argue, that's all.

72
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:17,748
"A word to the wise."

73
00:03:17,778 --> 00:03:19,728
Thank you. God, I hate texts.

74
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:21,870
It's the ugliest language on the planet.

75
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,241
Mr. Carver, I am not arguing in court.

76
00:03:24,271 --> 00:03:25,188
You are, Ms. Lockhart.

77
00:03:25,682 --> 00:03:27,723
You've been prepping this
case for the last six months.

78
00:03:27,725 --> 00:03:29,634
But not to argue in court.

79
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:31,408
This is an anti-euthanasia case.

80
00:03:31,438 --> 00:03:32,825
No, it's a pro-parent case.

81
00:03:32,855 --> 00:03:35,063
The parents of a girl
who committed suicide...

82
00:03:35,065 --> 00:03:38,300
But Mr. Dipple wants to use this
in order to beat back advances

83
00:03:38,302 --> 00:03:40,632
in physician-assisted suicide, right?

84
00:03:40,662 --> 00:03:42,905
I can't support that. I am pro-euthanasia.

85
00:03:42,907 --> 00:03:45,740
Ms. Lockhart, I hate being the bully here.

86
00:03:46,277 --> 00:03:47,742
I get very tense.

87
00:03:47,744 --> 00:03:50,524
Mr. Dipple compensates you very well.

88
00:03:50,554 --> 00:03:52,670
If you don't take over
this case, we will lose.

89
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,579
There is no one else who
knows it as well as you.

90
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:56,461
- As a devil's advocate.
- Yes, but

91
00:03:56,491 --> 00:03:59,754
who knows the advocate's
case better than the Devil?

92
00:04:01,456 --> 00:04:02,615
(Loud chatter, baby crying)

93
00:04:02,645 --> 00:04:05,959
All rise! Court is now in session.

94
00:04:05,961 --> 00:04:08,237
Let's get this show on the road.

95
00:04:08,267 --> 00:04:10,416
Gentlemen, good day.

96
00:04:10,446 --> 00:04:11,969
You have been arrested.

97
00:04:11,999 --> 00:04:13,470
It is our task today to figure out whether

98
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,369
you deserve bail and the amount.

99
00:04:16,371 --> 00:04:19,717
Think of it as the sorting
hat from <i>Harry Potter.</i>

100
00:04:19,747 --> 00:04:20,640
We're sorting you...

101
00:04:20,642 --> 00:04:21,863
So, where are we?

102
00:04:21,893 --> 00:04:25,184
I lead with 12,560 pounds.

103
00:04:25,214 --> 00:04:26,512
Come on, you do not.

104
00:04:26,514 --> 00:04:28,958
I got the last guy. 320 pounds.

105
00:04:28,988 --> 00:04:30,883
- It was on his arrest report.
- So, who's second?

106
00:04:30,885 --> 00:04:33,085
- We have a tie, Bernie, and...
- ALICIA: Good morning.

107
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:34,754
- Hello.
- What'd I miss?

108
00:04:34,756 --> 00:04:36,805
We just got back from
lunch, and we're tied.

109
00:04:36,835 --> 00:04:38,723
LUCCA: 11,300 pounds: Alicia.

110
00:04:38,725 --> 00:04:41,827
11,250 pounds: Bernie. A virtual tie.

111
00:04:41,829 --> 00:04:43,882
- I'm sorry. What?
- And Don brings up the rear.

112
00:04:43,912 --> 00:04:45,857
It's only 'cause I get
anorexic shoplifters.

113
00:04:45,887 --> 00:04:47,499
More sinned against than sinning.

114
00:04:47,501 --> 00:04:50,435
Don at 9,650 pounds

115
00:04:50,437 --> 00:04:52,743
- of anorexic shoplifters.
- ALICIA: Excuse me.

116
00:04:52,773 --> 00:04:55,133
But what are we talking about here?

117
00:04:55,163 --> 00:04:56,713
"Perps by the Pound."

118
00:04:57,426 --> 00:04:58,753
LUCCA: It's Shoplifting Day.

119
00:04:58,783 --> 00:05:00,852
Everyone with light fingers
gets processed today.

120
00:05:00,882 --> 00:05:02,948
And we're tied at 11,300 pounds.

121
00:05:02,978 --> 00:05:04,014
LUCCA: Virtually.

122
00:05:04,016 --> 00:05:06,650
- Pounds of what?
- Perps. Clients.

123
00:05:06,652 --> 00:05:08,151
You clear enough cases, you can beat Lucca.

124
00:05:08,153 --> 00:05:10,482
(Laughs): Are you guys serious?

125
00:05:10,512 --> 00:05:11,888
Yes, whoever wins

126
00:05:11,918 --> 00:05:13,957
gets first choice of what days to work.

127
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:16,997
You're competing over who
clears the most cases by weight?

128
00:05:17,027 --> 00:05:19,050
<i>- We're</i> competing.
- Oh, I'm not.

129
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,631
Uh, you're in second place. Yes, you are.

130
00:05:21,633 --> 00:05:23,222
SCHAKOWSKY: Are we all understanding?

131
00:05:23,252 --> 00:05:24,662
None of you are indigent, which means

132
00:05:24,692 --> 00:05:26,068
you must pay for your own attorney.

133
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:29,819
The Chicago Bar has provided us
with four bar attorneys. Please stand.

134
00:05:29,849 --> 00:05:32,392
They are available for
hire at your convenience.

135
00:05:32,422 --> 00:05:34,776
I want to be clear: you
do not need to hire them.

136
00:05:34,778 --> 00:05:36,945
If you do not hire them, you will be pushed

137
00:05:36,947 --> 00:05:38,477
to the back of the line, which means

138
00:05:38,507 --> 00:05:40,484
you will not be sorted until tomorrow.

139
00:05:40,514 --> 00:05:42,215
Are we all understanding?

140
00:05:42,245 --> 00:05:44,599
Bully. Here we go. Ms. Quinn,

141
00:05:44,629 --> 00:05:47,286
you have males 98 through 117.

142
00:05:47,316 --> 00:05:50,093
Mr. Bukovitz, 118 through 135.

143
00:05:50,123 --> 00:05:53,272
Mr. Weingarten, 136 to 151.

144
00:05:53,302 --> 00:05:55,681
And Mrs. Florrick, 152 to 170.

145
00:05:55,711 --> 00:05:58,175
- Male number 118.
- SCHAKOWSKY: All right, Matan...

146
00:05:58,205 --> 00:06:00,508
Male number 118.

147
00:06:00,538 --> 00:06:02,242
It's on your hand! Look at your hand!

148
00:06:02,272 --> 00:06:04,404
SCHAKOWSKY: Then the Class
C felons, and continuing on

149
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:06,573
to the violent offenders.
We have to get through

150
00:06:06,575 --> 00:06:09,252
a third of these before lunch.

151
00:06:09,282 --> 00:06:10,516
I've been appointed your bond attorney...

152
00:06:10,546 --> 00:06:13,346
Male 98? Where are you?

153
00:06:13,348 --> 00:06:15,381
Male 98?

154
00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:18,126
Too bad, Lucca.

155
00:06:18,156 --> 00:06:22,087
ALICIA: Male 28, Daniel
Rojas, attempted shoplifting.

156
00:06:23,396 --> 00:06:26,792
Good. Good, yeah, keep Lucca
from winning. She always wins.

157
00:06:26,794 --> 00:06:28,615
- I'm not playing.
- Well, that's fine with me.

158
00:06:28,645 --> 00:06:30,386
But what are you gonna
do, not clear his case?

159
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:31,619
BUKOVITZ: Do you speak English?

160
00:06:31,649 --> 00:06:33,248
WEINGARTEN: Male 136.

161
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:36,205
Male 152... retail theft
in the amount of $45.

162
00:06:36,235 --> 00:06:39,218
- What do you got, Mr. Brody?
- A repeat offender. Nine months probation.

163
00:06:39,248 --> 00:06:40,847
Mr. Mason pleads guilty, Your Honor.

164
00:06:40,877 --> 00:06:43,126
SCHAKOWSKY Good. Time served. Male 98!

165
00:06:43,156 --> 00:06:45,353
Good, wipe that cocky
smile off Bernie's face.

166
00:06:45,383 --> 00:06:48,162
I'm not playing. I'm <i>not!</i>

167
00:06:48,342 --> 00:06:50,975
58, Ms. Brantley, liquor store theft?

168
00:06:51,005 --> 00:06:52,900
(Overlapping chatter)

169
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:55,392
Uh, ma'am, over here.

170
00:06:55,422 --> 00:06:57,707
- I'm innocent. I really am.
- BUKOVITZ: Ma'am, this is

171
00:06:57,737 --> 00:06:59,303
your first arrest. The
judge'll go easy on you,

172
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:00,692
you'll get probation, go home today.

173
00:07:00,722 --> 00:07:02,073
But I didn't steal anything.

174
00:07:02,103 --> 00:07:04,249
It was a gift. I brought it back so I could

175
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:05,619
- exchange it for something else.
- Look, there's no time for this.

176
00:07:05,649 --> 00:07:07,757
They're saying I was
making a false return, like

177
00:07:07,787 --> 00:07:10,282
- I stole it so I could get money.
- If you want to fight this,

178
00:07:10,284 --> 00:07:11,984
it'll take months of
your life and thousands

179
00:07:11,986 --> 00:07:13,092
of dollars to defend yourself.

180
00:07:13,122 --> 00:07:14,943
You want to say I'm guilty, but I can't.

181
00:07:14,973 --> 00:07:16,280
I can't look at my kids and say...

182
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,979
Look, there's no time to discuss this.

183
00:07:18,009 --> 00:07:19,575
The state's attorney might even add charges

184
00:07:19,577 --> 00:07:22,727
- if you insist on your innocence.
- He can do that?

185
00:07:22,873 --> 00:07:26,199
He can do whatever he wants.
He's a real son of a bitch.

186
00:07:26,229 --> 00:07:27,416
I don't care.

187
00:07:27,446 --> 00:07:28,938
I'm not guilty.

188
00:07:30,136 --> 00:07:32,765
Okay. I'll talk to the prosecutor
and see what I can get,

189
00:07:32,795 --> 00:07:35,223
but you have to get yourself into
this new frame of mind, ma'am.

190
00:07:35,225 --> 00:07:36,694
You're under arrest.

191
00:07:36,724 --> 00:07:39,761
Sometimes it doesn't make a
difference if you did it or not.

192
00:07:39,763 --> 00:07:41,796
(Baby crying)

193
00:07:41,798 --> 00:07:43,964
(Sighs)

194
00:07:45,724 --> 00:07:47,724
You trying to guess my weight?

195
00:07:49,287 --> 00:07:51,672
- Excuse me?
- I heard your friends laughing.

196
00:07:51,674 --> 00:07:55,124
You-you score points based on
your clients' weight, right?

197
00:07:56,453 --> 00:07:58,253
I'm not doing that, ma'am.

198
00:07:59,221 --> 00:08:00,921
Then what are you doing?

199
00:08:08,401 --> 00:08:09,451
He's lying.

200
00:08:09,987 --> 00:08:11,724
The prosecutor can't add charges

201
00:08:11,726 --> 00:08:13,584
just because you won't take a plea.

202
00:08:13,614 --> 00:08:14,508
(Coughs)

203
00:08:14,538 --> 00:08:16,445
- Yeah.
- Hello. Um, Ms. Brantley,

204
00:08:16,475 --> 00:08:17,863
- I'm Alicia Florrick,
- Okay, good news.

205
00:08:17,865 --> 00:08:18,874
- and I'm a bar attorney...
- Prosecutor's willing to play ball...

206
00:08:18,904 --> 00:08:22,193
- probation, one year.
- No. You're fired.

207
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:24,636
I want her.

208
00:08:27,086 --> 00:08:28,421
This is nothing more
than a ploy, Your Honor.

209
00:08:28,451 --> 00:08:30,141
This case should be tried
in Oregon, Your Honor,

210
00:08:30,143 --> 00:08:32,210
- where my clients have their practices.
- But Alexa Banner's

211
00:08:32,212 --> 00:08:34,594
suicide took place here in Illinois,

212
00:08:34,624 --> 00:08:36,689
where physician-assisted
suicide is still illegal.

213
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:37,780
Whoa.

214
00:08:38,723 --> 00:08:40,237
Mr. Canning, are you okay?

215
00:08:40,267 --> 00:08:43,615
Yeah, I-I... I will be in a
second. I just have to get...

216
00:08:43,645 --> 00:08:46,229
Your Honor, um, Mr. Canning

217
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:47,925
knows that an Oregon jury

218
00:08:47,955 --> 00:08:49,827
will be more sympathetic to his case.

219
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:51,479
This court... How many?

220
00:08:52,248 --> 00:08:53,461
I got it.

221
00:08:53,768 --> 00:08:54,775
DIANE: These doctors knew

222
00:08:54,805 --> 00:08:56,332
that the victim was bringing drugs

223
00:08:56,334 --> 00:08:58,768
to Chicago in order to kill herself.

224
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:00,536
The trial should take place here.

225
00:09:00,538 --> 00:09:03,343
I'm agreeing with Ms. Lockhart
on this one, Mr. Canning.

226
00:09:03,373 --> 00:09:04,523
(Gavel bangs)

227
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:07,543
CANNING: Diane, why are you doing this?

228
00:09:07,694 --> 00:09:10,293
You're fighting for a cause you
fundamentally don't believe in.

229
00:09:10,323 --> 00:09:12,047
Because you make me angry.

230
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:16,051
Mr. Dipple has been very pleased

231
00:09:16,053 --> 00:09:18,220
with the work you've been
doing these last few months.

232
00:09:18,222 --> 00:09:21,971
So, keep it up... but keep
the billable hours down.

233
00:09:22,001 --> 00:09:23,363
(Applause)

234
00:09:24,433 --> 00:09:26,008
We're happy to have you here, Mr. Carver.

235
00:09:26,038 --> 00:09:27,639
Is there anything else we can do for you?

236
00:09:27,669 --> 00:09:29,396
I'm sure you're aware the
Illinois General Assembly

237
00:09:29,398 --> 00:09:32,448
is considering the
Physician-Assisted Suicide Act.

238
00:09:33,055 --> 00:09:35,083
Yes. The Medical Coalition of Illinois

239
00:09:35,113 --> 00:09:37,128
recently dropped their objections.
That's a game-changer.

240
00:09:37,158 --> 00:09:38,322
And like California,

241
00:09:38,352 --> 00:09:40,958
it gives the governor
a path to approving it.

242
00:09:40,988 --> 00:09:44,500
I understand you know the
governor's wife, Alicia Florrick.

243
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,719
You want us to talk to her?

244
00:09:46,921 --> 00:09:49,020
Blocking physician-assisted
suicide is an issue

245
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:50,939
Mr. Dipple feels in his gut.

246
00:09:50,969 --> 00:09:52,698
He wants to fight this
on every front possible.

247
00:09:52,728 --> 00:09:54,654
Alicia doesn't work here anymore because

248
00:09:54,656 --> 00:09:58,556
- Mr. Dipple didn't want her here.
- But let us see what we can do.

249
00:09:59,249 --> 00:10:00,644
BUKOVITZ: <i>You're screwing
me out of my fee.</i>

250
00:10:00,674 --> 00:10:02,828
You're trying to sabotage
me so you can take the day.

251
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:04,793
You really think I care that much
about your little game?

252
00:10:04,823 --> 00:10:06,742
She was about to take the deal
till you stuck your nose in it.

253
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:09,268
- What's going on?
- She's trying to screw me out of my $135.

254
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:11,403
- No, your client is...
- Alicia, professional courtesy.

255
00:10:11,405 --> 00:10:14,140
We don't undercut each other,
we don't snake each other's fees.

256
00:10:14,142 --> 00:10:15,612
BUKOVITZ: The Florricks apparently do.

257
00:10:15,642 --> 00:10:17,976
Need an election, just steal it.

258
00:10:18,504 --> 00:10:20,036
- Go to hell, Bernie.
- No.

259
00:10:20,066 --> 00:10:24,231
You want her and her 120
pounds so much, fine. Go for it.

260
00:10:24,261 --> 00:10:26,742
SHERIFF: 130 to 140...

261
00:10:26,772 --> 00:10:28,857
SCHAKOWSKY: Come on,
female 42. Retail theft

262
00:10:28,887 --> 00:10:30,794
in the amount of $899. What's the offer?

263
00:10:30,824 --> 00:10:32,862
- One year probation.
- Good. Defense?

264
00:10:32,892 --> 00:10:36,010
Uh, Your Honor, unfortunately
my client cannot allocute.

265
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,638
- Why?
- It's a good offer, Judge,

266
00:10:37,668 --> 00:10:40,335
- she stole a $899 sweater.
- He's right, ma'am.

267
00:10:40,365 --> 00:10:42,900
Your record could be sealed
six months after probation.

268
00:10:42,902 --> 00:10:44,802
But I didn't steal anything.

269
00:10:48,146 --> 00:10:49,628
Approach, Counselors.

270
00:10:52,361 --> 00:10:55,511
Sweeten the deal, Matan.
Now. It's her first arrest.

271
00:10:55,553 --> 00:10:57,592
I could live with six months.
But that's my basement.

272
00:10:57,622 --> 00:10:58,779
There. He did his part.

273
00:10:58,809 --> 00:11:00,549
- My client won't take it.
- Then do your damn job

274
00:11:00,551 --> 00:11:01,990
and sell it to her.

275
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:04,164
And don't you dare slow
me down, Mrs. Florrick.

276
00:11:04,194 --> 00:11:07,489
I'll recall you in a minute. Female 44,

277
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,970
retail theft of $71.

278
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,918
I can probably get her to take six months

279
00:11:11,948 --> 00:11:13,521
with a reducer to a misdemeanor.

280
00:11:13,551 --> 00:11:15,496
No, I did my caving.

281
00:11:15,526 --> 00:11:17,076
I need a guilty plea.

282
00:11:18,179 --> 00:11:20,402
The prosecution is willing
to take it down to six months

283
00:11:20,432 --> 00:11:22,170
probation, but you'll need to plead guilty.

284
00:11:22,172 --> 00:11:24,505
But all I did was return a sweater.

285
00:11:24,507 --> 00:11:25,740
This is...

286
00:11:26,359 --> 00:11:27,474
I'm not admitting to anything.

287
00:11:27,476 --> 00:11:30,049
Maia, listen to me. You
won't serve one hour in jail.

288
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:31,312
But it'll be on my record.

289
00:11:31,342 --> 00:11:33,887
For six months, and then
you can have it sealed.

290
00:11:33,917 --> 00:11:36,250
Female 42. Recalled.

291
00:11:40,089 --> 00:11:42,039
So, we, uh, closing this out?

292
00:11:42,454 --> 00:11:43,974
My client pleads not guilty.

293
00:11:44,004 --> 00:11:47,260
Seriously? He offered you six months. Six.

294
00:11:47,262 --> 00:11:49,529
- Yes, but she cannot plead...
- Up here, Mrs. Florrick.

295
00:11:53,124 --> 00:11:54,833
I'm sorry, Your Honor, I tried.

296
00:11:54,863 --> 00:11:56,663
Give the rest of your defendant sheets

297
00:11:56,693 --> 00:11:58,211
to the sheriff. They're being distributed.

298
00:11:58,241 --> 00:12:00,475
- What? Why?
- I know you get paid by the case.

299
00:12:00,505 --> 00:12:03,817
Call it quid pro quo for the time
you're costing this court.

300
00:12:03,847 --> 00:12:05,605
- Your Honor...
- You can sit on that pew with your

301
00:12:05,635 --> 00:12:08,433
precious client until preliminary
hearings, for all I care.

302
00:12:08,463 --> 00:12:11,564
Female 65. Retail theft
in the amount of $93.

303
00:12:11,594 --> 00:12:13,218
Your Honor, this is unfair.

304
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:16,995
Ma'am, when did you think bond
court was about being fair?

305
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:24,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

306
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,885
What's going on?

307
00:12:27,397 --> 00:12:29,163
I'm being taxed.

308
00:12:32,764 --> 00:12:41,367
= synced and corrected by Shahrazade =
... www.addic7ed.com ...

309
00:12:48,472 --> 00:12:49,572
Remember me?

310
00:12:51,694 --> 00:12:52,828
Hope I'm not interrupting.

311
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:55,867
No, not at all. Eli and I were just

312
00:12:55,897 --> 00:12:58,341
going over the campaign scheduling.

313
00:12:58,371 --> 00:13:00,468
I like your office.

314
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:03,205
Can't help but think of when
we started the firm here.

315
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:07,976
So... I came to ask if
you'd lobby Peter on a bill.

316
00:13:08,792 --> 00:13:11,427
It's called the
Physician-Assisted Suicide Act.

317
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:12,831
It'll hit Peter's desk in a week or so.

318
00:13:12,861 --> 00:13:14,754
And you want me to persuade him to sign it?

319
00:13:14,784 --> 00:13:16,617
No. Veto it.

320
00:13:16,619 --> 00:13:18,419
Really? Why is that?

321
00:13:18,608 --> 00:13:20,758
You wanted to return to the firm.

322
00:13:20,814 --> 00:13:22,840
This could be your ticket back.

323
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:25,669
I don't understand.

324
00:13:25,699 --> 00:13:29,262
Well, Reese Dipple is the
reason you're not at the firm.

325
00:13:30,033 --> 00:13:31,933
You sway Peter on this bill,

326
00:13:32,522 --> 00:13:34,401
and Dipple will sprinkle rose petals

327
00:13:34,403 --> 00:13:36,536
as you step off the elevator.

328
00:13:41,011 --> 00:13:42,011
No.

329
00:13:43,052 --> 00:13:44,423
I'm happy here, Cary.

330
00:13:44,453 --> 00:13:45,444
I like what I'm doing.

331
00:13:45,474 --> 00:13:47,118
It's not a lot of money.

332
00:13:47,148 --> 00:13:48,613
I know.

333
00:13:49,294 --> 00:13:51,550
Anyway, I ask for something from Peter,

334
00:13:51,552 --> 00:13:53,282
he asks for something back.

335
00:13:53,312 --> 00:13:55,254
And I don't want to be asked for anything.

336
00:13:55,256 --> 00:13:58,390
Especially not physician-assisted suicide.

337
00:13:59,063 --> 00:14:00,308
WOMAN: No mother should have to watch

338
00:14:00,338 --> 00:14:02,393
their child go through what Alexa did.

339
00:14:02,854 --> 00:14:04,453
I just wish she could have
held on a little longer.

340
00:14:04,483 --> 00:14:05,921
But isn't that selfish?

341
00:14:05,951 --> 00:14:09,043
Why make her hold on if
she was in so much pain?

342
00:14:09,073 --> 00:14:10,420
- Why not let her go?
- If she were terminal,

343
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:12,770
- I could have let her go, but she wasn't.
- Objection, Your Honor,

344
00:14:12,772 --> 00:14:15,352
um, the witness is-is
not a medical expert.

345
00:14:15,382 --> 00:14:17,697
My clients can speak to Alexa's condition.

346
00:14:17,727 --> 00:14:20,292
You'd be surprised what
kind of expert you can become

347
00:14:20,322 --> 00:14:21,744
when your child gets brain cancer.

348
00:14:21,746 --> 00:14:24,348
Uh, ma'am, please. Let
me rule on the objections.

349
00:14:26,403 --> 00:14:27,548
Overruled.

350
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:29,519
Mrs. Banner, the doctors here

351
00:14:29,521 --> 00:14:31,046
at the defense table said that

352
00:14:31,076 --> 00:14:32,384
your daughter <i>was</i> terminal.

353
00:14:32,414 --> 00:14:33,499
They were wrong.

354
00:14:33,529 --> 00:14:36,295
A week before they prescribed
those suicide drugs,

355
00:14:36,297 --> 00:14:38,464
Duke University announced a new treatment

356
00:14:38,466 --> 00:14:40,489
for glioblastoma tumors.

357
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:43,090
Let me help you with those, Mr. Canning.

358
00:14:46,161 --> 00:14:47,745
And what was that treatment?

359
00:14:48,106 --> 00:14:49,475
The polio virus.

360
00:14:49,477 --> 00:14:52,009
It's introduced into
the tumorous brain cells

361
00:14:52,011 --> 00:14:54,179
so it won't reproduce in the healthy ones.

362
00:14:54,181 --> 00:14:55,613
It destroys the tumor.

363
00:14:56,284 --> 00:14:57,748
And if your daughter had been told

364
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:00,585
that there was hope in this treatment?

365
00:15:01,654 --> 00:15:03,854
She'd still be here.

366
00:15:04,968 --> 00:15:07,155
Would you like to take
a minute, Mrs. Banner?

367
00:15:07,185 --> 00:15:08,758
No.

368
00:15:09,353 --> 00:15:11,672
If I knew about this
treatment, why didn't they?

369
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:13,664
Why did they give her drugs to kill herself

370
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:15,766
instead of giving her hope?

371
00:15:15,768 --> 00:15:18,168
That's not what doctors are supposed to do.

372
00:15:24,711 --> 00:15:26,111
Mr. Crouse.

373
00:15:27,645 --> 00:15:29,315
Mrs. Florrick.

374
00:15:30,991 --> 00:15:33,027
You could've knocked. My daughter's home.

375
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:34,049
Didn't want to.

376
00:15:34,051 --> 00:15:35,551
I thought you found another investigator.

377
00:15:35,553 --> 00:15:37,200
I felt rejected.

378
00:15:39,177 --> 00:15:41,524
Well... we were broke.

379
00:15:41,526 --> 00:15:44,816
Ah, so you found a rich client now?

380
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:47,266
We found a client.

381
00:15:47,296 --> 00:15:50,006
She's willing to pay for
three hours of an investigator.

382
00:15:50,036 --> 00:15:53,323
Really? How extravagant. Starting now?

383
00:15:53,353 --> 00:15:54,523
Mm-hmm.

384
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:58,222
She's telling the truth.
I bought the sweater

385
00:15:58,224 --> 00:15:59,862
for my daughter, for her birthday.

386
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:02,760
- And do you have the receipt?
- No, I think I threw it away.

387
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:04,762
Do you know what day you bought it, ma'am?

388
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:06,155
Oh...

389
00:16:06,185 --> 00:16:08,265
Sunday before her birthday.

390
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:09,500
August 16.

391
00:16:09,502 --> 00:16:11,340
- Did you pay cash or credit card?
- Cash.

392
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:12,767
Always cash.

393
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:16,431
- I'm guessing that's not good.
- It just makes it more difficult

394
00:16:16,461 --> 00:16:17,818
for us to prove that you bought it.

395
00:16:17,848 --> 00:16:20,543
You're not covering for your
daughter, are you, Mrs. Sachs?

396
00:16:22,419 --> 00:16:25,772
No. Have you ever shopped
at the store? At Salvatori's?

397
00:16:25,802 --> 00:16:27,799
- No, ma'am.
- I have, a few times. Why?

398
00:16:27,829 --> 00:16:29,686
They don't want me to shop there.

399
00:16:30,102 --> 00:16:32,255
They tend to make it difficult for you.

400
00:16:32,468 --> 00:16:33,694
Not for you, but for us.

401
00:16:33,724 --> 00:16:36,225
Are you saying your daughter
was targeted because of her race?

402
00:16:36,227 --> 00:16:39,157
Yes. Actually, I am saying that.

403
00:16:39,187 --> 00:16:41,119
My daughter is no thief.

404
00:16:41,149 --> 00:16:42,436
JASON: Okay.

405
00:16:42,466 --> 00:16:44,469
Let me see what I can find out.

406
00:16:48,104 --> 00:16:50,842
So this is your new office?

407
00:16:50,872 --> 00:16:52,640
Yes, Jackie.

408
00:16:52,952 --> 00:16:55,576
It's not as big as it once was.

409
00:16:55,578 --> 00:16:56,849
That's right.

410
00:16:57,156 --> 00:16:58,713
And you're dressing up more?

411
00:16:59,065 --> 00:17:00,430
No, these are my usual clothes.

412
00:17:00,432 --> 00:17:01,965
Are you sure?

413
00:17:01,967 --> 00:17:04,406
I don't remember you
showing so much cleavage.

414
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:07,937
And you had a haircut. It's very different.

415
00:17:07,939 --> 00:17:09,076
Yes.

416
00:17:09,106 --> 00:17:12,210
Many changes. A world in transition.

417
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,369
Mm.

418
00:17:14,891 --> 00:17:17,632
What is it you need from me, Mr. Gold?

419
00:17:18,023 --> 00:17:20,410
Peter is being pressured
to take a stance on a bill

420
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,764
legalizing physician-assisted suicide.

421
00:17:22,794 --> 00:17:24,620
What? What stance?

422
00:17:25,074 --> 00:17:26,543
- Against it.
- Against

423
00:17:26,573 --> 00:17:28,857
- physician-assisted suicide?
- Yes.

424
00:17:29,029 --> 00:17:30,134
But he doesn't believe that.

425
00:17:30,164 --> 00:17:33,810
That's probably true, but...

426
00:17:34,567 --> 00:17:35,819
the Catholic

427
00:17:35,849 --> 00:17:39,735
and conservative lobbies have his ear.

428
00:17:40,179 --> 00:17:41,902
He'd probably want to hear from you.

429
00:17:42,054 --> 00:17:43,488
A concerned member of the family.

430
00:17:43,518 --> 00:17:46,623
But... only if you have the time.

431
00:17:47,379 --> 00:17:48,591
I could make time.

432
00:17:48,621 --> 00:17:50,667
He has a new campaign manager now.

433
00:17:50,697 --> 00:17:52,552
Ruth Eastman.

434
00:17:52,582 --> 00:17:54,321
She likes to limit access to Peter,

435
00:17:54,351 --> 00:17:56,283
but just you tell her you're his mother,

436
00:17:56,285 --> 00:17:58,185
and I'm sure she'll make an allowance.

437
00:18:01,154 --> 00:18:02,088
- MATAN: Judge, four different
- ALICIA: Which prevents me

438
00:18:02,589 --> 00:18:03,593
- times before, they found
- from mounting

439
00:18:03,623 --> 00:18:04,663
- a client of yours guilty.
- a proper defense.

440
00:18:04,693 --> 00:18:06,326
- You know they're playing games.
- Objection.

441
00:18:06,328 --> 00:18:08,291
It's a perfectly reasonable
request, your Honor.

442
00:18:08,321 --> 00:18:09,563
Requests, plural.

443
00:18:09,565 --> 00:18:11,723
She's asking for both
the SKU from the sweater

444
00:18:11,753 --> 00:18:13,358
and the store's surveillance video.

445
00:18:13,388 --> 00:18:15,503
- This is for a lousy...
- What is a SKU?

446
00:18:15,533 --> 00:18:17,186
A stock-keeping unit, Your Honor.

447
00:18:17,216 --> 00:18:20,038
It's an electronic identifier
attached to every sales item

448
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,112
- to keep it from being stolen.
- Oh, God.

449
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:23,542
Get up here, Mrs. Florrick.

450
00:18:24,945 --> 00:18:26,545
No, not you.

451
00:18:27,914 --> 00:18:30,516
This is not <i>To Kill a Mockingbird.</i>

452
00:18:30,518 --> 00:18:32,984
This is not <i>Anatomy of a Murder.</i>

453
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:36,554
This is a constitutionally
mandated necessity.

454
00:18:36,859 --> 00:18:39,775
It is Lucille Ball wrapping chocolates

455
00:18:39,805 --> 00:18:41,283
on an assembly line.

456
00:18:41,313 --> 00:18:44,952
Cases get processed, justice
is served for the greater whole.

457
00:18:44,982 --> 00:18:46,580
Not for you, not for her.

458
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:47,999
For all people.

459
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:51,902
And I will be damned if I
will allow you to gum it up.

460
00:18:52,439 --> 00:18:54,217
Motion denied. Step the hell back.

461
00:18:54,247 --> 00:18:56,836
Then we request a continuance, Your Honor.

462
00:18:56,866 --> 00:18:58,809
Preliminary hearings
are for the prosecution.

463
00:18:58,811 --> 00:19:01,712
- Are you ready to proceed, Mr. Brody?
- 100%.

464
00:19:01,714 --> 00:19:03,819
- Then call your first witness.
- Your Honor, this is wholly unfair.

465
00:19:03,849 --> 00:19:05,582
Damn straight, Marie Antoinette.

466
00:19:05,584 --> 00:19:07,349
Because every other defendant in this room

467
00:19:07,351 --> 00:19:09,226
and in that hallway isn't
gonna see their kids tonight,

468
00:19:09,256 --> 00:19:10,428
thanks to you.

469
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:11,886
Now step back.

470
00:19:13,506 --> 00:19:15,209
You're on, Mr. Brody.

471
00:19:15,239 --> 00:19:18,346
DIANE: You have glioblastoma
multiforme, is that correct?

472
00:19:18,376 --> 00:19:20,285
I had it. Past tense.

473
00:19:20,315 --> 00:19:22,537
So your tumor... the exact type

474
00:19:22,567 --> 00:19:24,478
that Alexa Banner had...

475
00:19:24,508 --> 00:19:25,734
- is gone?
- Yeah.

476
00:19:25,736 --> 00:19:29,404
Thanks to the Duke polio
trial, I am cancer-free.

477
00:19:29,406 --> 00:19:30,872
Elvis has left the building.

478
00:19:30,874 --> 00:19:33,236
And when you were ill, did you

479
00:19:33,266 --> 00:19:35,777
contemplate suicide?

480
00:19:36,089 --> 00:19:37,813
Every day for about a year.

481
00:19:37,962 --> 00:19:40,548
- I didn't want to go on.
- But then you found hope?

482
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:42,015
Objection, Your Honor.
Counsel is testifying.

483
00:19:42,017 --> 00:19:43,984
Withdrawn. Mr. Linklater,

484
00:19:43,986 --> 00:19:45,814
would you consider yourself
a medical miracle?

485
00:19:45,844 --> 00:19:48,923
Objection, miracles have no basis in fact.

486
00:19:49,148 --> 00:19:51,431
Really? I saw the '69 Mets.

487
00:19:51,824 --> 00:19:53,494
(Gallery chuckles)

488
00:19:54,481 --> 00:19:56,664
How about a recess, Your Honor?

489
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:58,169
What are you offering, Mr. Canning?

490
00:19:58,199 --> 00:20:00,066
$1 million, no admission of liability,

491
00:20:00,068 --> 00:20:02,635
and, uh, a gag order.

492
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:05,505
Okay. I will take that to our client.

493
00:20:05,507 --> 00:20:07,907
Are you willing to drop the gag order?

494
00:20:10,328 --> 00:20:12,478
No, that's-that's non-negotiable.

495
00:20:13,623 --> 00:20:15,581
Then you can expect a no.

496
00:20:19,925 --> 00:20:22,688
Dipple must be paying you
one hell of a retainer.

497
00:20:22,876 --> 00:20:24,556
That's a good offer I made you in there.

498
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:26,492
And our clients will hear it.

499
00:20:26,494 --> 00:20:27,702
This is such a farce.

500
00:20:27,732 --> 00:20:29,327
I mean, you of all people support

501
00:20:29,329 --> 00:20:31,463
physician-assisted suicide, Diane.

502
00:20:32,199 --> 00:20:34,515
When did you go mercenary?

503
00:20:34,545 --> 00:20:36,801
And who's paying your bills, Louis?

504
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,970
You win, more people kill themselves,

505
00:20:38,972 --> 00:20:40,766
and the insurance companies save billions

506
00:20:40,796 --> 00:20:42,037
on hospital expenses.

507
00:20:42,067 --> 00:20:43,908
Yeah, sure, I'm an insurance company shill.

508
00:20:44,418 --> 00:20:45,967
But they happen to be on
the right side of this issue.

509
00:20:45,997 --> 00:20:48,117
I'm not gonna take lessons
in hypocrisy from you.

510
00:20:48,147 --> 00:20:50,313
Carver and Dipple don't
care about your clients.

511
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:52,048
They just want to raise malpractice rates.

512
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:55,285
Intimidate doctors out
of helping people die.

513
00:20:55,717 --> 00:20:57,622
Talk to your clients.

514
00:20:57,945 --> 00:21:00,924
See how much they really
care about gag orders.

515
00:21:06,059 --> 00:21:07,124
Mr. Gold, hi.

516
00:21:07,154 --> 00:21:08,497
- Oh, my mom's not here.
- That's okay,

517
00:21:08,499 --> 00:21:10,165
I just came to drop something off for her.

518
00:21:10,167 --> 00:21:11,834
This week's invitations.

519
00:21:12,181 --> 00:21:14,870
Women's group meetings all
over Iowa, bar functions.

520
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,084
Any command performances?

521
00:21:16,114 --> 00:21:17,473
They're tabbed red, yellow, and green.

522
00:21:17,475 --> 00:21:18,863
Oh. Thanks.

523
00:21:18,893 --> 00:21:21,081
Actually, Grace, do you have a minute?

524
00:21:21,111 --> 00:21:22,583
Sure, what's up?

525
00:21:23,076 --> 00:21:26,247
What do you think about
physician-assisted suicide?

526
00:21:26,349 --> 00:21:27,781
Why?

527
00:21:27,783 --> 00:21:30,050
You're still...

528
00:21:30,052 --> 00:21:31,552
Christian, right?

529
00:21:31,554 --> 00:21:33,254
Yeah, I'm still Christian.

530
00:21:33,284 --> 00:21:35,761
Well, I think your dad

531
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:36,973
might need some advice

532
00:21:37,003 --> 00:21:40,791
from someone who is against
physician-assisted suicide.

533
00:21:42,595 --> 00:21:44,319
Edward Waller. I'm a security officer

534
00:21:44,349 --> 00:21:46,649
- at Salvatori's Department Store.
- MATAN: And before that,

535
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:49,225
you served as a specialist
in the U.S. Army,

536
00:21:49,255 --> 00:21:51,191
- training soldiers in Iraq?
- Objection.

537
00:21:51,221 --> 00:21:52,887
Relevance.

538
00:21:52,917 --> 00:21:55,075
Oh, dear God. Are you serious?

539
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:58,499
Overruled. Overruled. Continue.

540
00:21:58,529 --> 00:22:00,963
I worked at Al Asad
Air Base, Anbar Province

541
00:22:00,965 --> 00:22:02,679
- for two years.
- Mr. Waller, this

542
00:22:02,709 --> 00:22:04,266
is the report you filed

543
00:22:04,268 --> 00:22:05,968
on the theft by Maia Sachs.

544
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:08,537
Does this accurately describe
the events of this past Tuesday?

545
00:22:08,539 --> 00:22:10,313
Sure does. We see this ruse every day.

546
00:22:10,343 --> 00:22:12,746
Customer walks in with
an empty Salvatori bag.

547
00:22:12,776 --> 00:22:15,571
They rip the tags off some
item, drop the item in the bag,

548
00:22:15,601 --> 00:22:17,722
- and pretend to return it for cash.
- Thank you.

549
00:22:17,752 --> 00:22:19,487
- Mr. Waller...
- We're done here, Mrs. Florrick.

550
00:22:19,517 --> 00:22:21,285
I... Excuse me?

551
00:22:21,315 --> 00:22:23,359
We're done here. You can cross tomorrow.

552
00:22:23,389 --> 00:22:24,440
Factory whistle's blown.

553
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:26,901
Your Honor, my-my cross
will only take a few minutes.

554
00:22:26,931 --> 00:22:28,635
SCHAKOWSKY: Mrs. Sachs,
you'll be spending the night

555
00:22:28,665 --> 00:22:30,749
in the Cook County Jail
unless you choose to plead...

556
00:22:30,779 --> 00:22:34,794
Your Honor, this is... this is blackmail.

557
00:22:38,245 --> 00:22:41,301
Plead or jail, Mrs. Sachs?

558
00:22:42,544 --> 00:22:44,065
- I'm not pleading.
- Fine.

559
00:22:44,095 --> 00:22:45,557
Henry, would you please escort

560
00:22:45,587 --> 00:22:47,251
Mrs. Sachs to the Cook County Jail?

561
00:22:47,281 --> 00:22:49,342
ALICIA: Hang in there, Maia. It'll be okay.

562
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:50,642
SCHAKOWSKY: And if it's
not okay, Mrs. Sachs,

563
00:22:50,672 --> 00:22:52,164
you can blame your attorney.

564
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:51,663
Alicia, it's Jason.

565
00:23:51,693 --> 00:23:55,073
You ever argue a case
against racial profiling?

566
00:23:55,103 --> 00:23:56,269
ETHAN: <i>I'm optimistic.</i>

567
00:23:56,299 --> 00:23:58,087
Wind's blowing our way.

568
00:23:58,626 --> 00:24:00,686
Is this a Trojan horse?

569
00:24:00,716 --> 00:24:02,675
Reese, may I call you back?

570
00:24:02,677 --> 00:24:03,586
Trojan horse?

571
00:24:03,616 --> 00:24:05,666
To raise malpractice insurance.

572
00:24:06,535 --> 00:24:09,572
To make sure no doctor
ever helps a dying patient

573
00:24:09,602 --> 00:24:10,737
end his or her life?

574
00:24:10,767 --> 00:24:13,178
Yes, of course. That's a secondary purpose.

575
00:24:13,208 --> 00:24:15,316
So this is the first of many suits?

576
00:24:15,346 --> 00:24:17,429
Doctors are rarely moved
by ethical arguments

577
00:24:17,459 --> 00:24:18,891
against euthanasia.

578
00:24:18,893 --> 00:24:20,960
But they do understand money.

579
00:24:20,962 --> 00:24:24,868
Rising malpractice rates
tend to sharpen the mind.

580
00:24:25,202 --> 00:24:27,999
Do you know any terminally
ill people, Mr. Carver?

581
00:24:28,001 --> 00:24:30,569
I mean gravely ill and in constant pain?

582
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,533
- Yes.
- And you don't think that person

583
00:24:32,563 --> 00:24:35,879
has the right to end his or her life?

584
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,442
I don't think doctors should
be in the business of killing,

585
00:24:38,444 --> 00:24:40,378
if that's what you're asking.

586
00:24:40,634 --> 00:24:42,680
I know it's a strange concept.

587
00:24:43,409 --> 00:24:46,008
But I don't like when
categories get confused.

588
00:24:46,038 --> 00:24:48,439
When a fireman starts fires
instead of putting them out.

589
00:24:48,469 --> 00:24:49,859
<i>Fahrenheit 451.</i>

590
00:24:49,889 --> 00:24:51,738
- I thought you'd appreciate that.
- So you're fine

591
00:24:51,768 --> 00:24:55,146
with civilian volunteers helping
people die instead of doctors?

592
00:24:55,176 --> 00:24:58,228
No. But at least it would take
the veneer of medicine away

593
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:59,750
- from it.
- I don't understand you people.

594
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:02,566
- We people?
- You want to get government off our backs

595
00:25:02,568 --> 00:25:05,335
until it comes to issues
like abortion and euthanasia.

596
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:08,071
A perfectly healthy woman
was allowed to kill herself

597
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:10,273
at an assisted dying clinic in Basel.

598
00:25:10,275 --> 00:25:12,308
She wasn't terminal, she wasn't sick.

599
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:14,510
Her only rationale was...

600
00:25:15,065 --> 00:25:16,169
she was afraid of getting old.

601
00:25:16,199 --> 00:25:18,447
- And losing control.
- Doctors killed

602
00:25:18,449 --> 00:25:22,822
1,807 people last year in Belgium.

603
00:25:22,852 --> 00:25:24,499
- Some only suffering from depression.
- Yes,

604
00:25:24,529 --> 00:25:26,422
and if this were Belgium, we
would have something to argue

605
00:25:26,424 --> 00:25:28,490
- about...
- Dominoes fall fast in this country.

606
00:25:28,492 --> 00:25:29,724
Just ask gay couples

607
00:25:29,726 --> 00:25:31,671
- getting married in Alabama.
- Ouch.

608
00:25:31,701 --> 00:25:33,060
Ouch, my head is hurting

609
00:25:33,062 --> 00:25:34,696
- from the wrongness here.
- You ask anyone

610
00:25:34,698 --> 00:25:37,591
who survives a jump from
the Golden Gate Bridge

611
00:25:37,621 --> 00:25:38,533
what their last thought is...

612
00:25:38,535 --> 00:25:40,041
You've done a lot of that, have you?

613
00:25:40,071 --> 00:25:43,110
It's always this: what a
stupid mistake I just made.

614
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:45,811
And that's why you would
take away their choice?

615
00:25:45,841 --> 00:25:48,235
I don't think this country should
make it easier for people to die.

616
00:25:48,265 --> 00:25:50,611
- Not even the terminally ill?
- We should make it easier

617
00:25:50,613 --> 00:25:52,379
to manage pain. That should be the goal.

618
00:25:52,381 --> 00:25:53,880
Why not both?

619
00:25:56,066 --> 00:25:57,618
Do you want off this case?

620
00:26:02,841 --> 00:26:04,120
No.

621
00:26:05,993 --> 00:26:08,294
But I want it to be about this case

622
00:26:08,709 --> 00:26:10,429
and not every case.

623
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,379
Okay.

624
00:26:14,269 --> 00:26:16,659
- Raptor is on-site.
- WOMAN: It's Mrs. Florrick.

625
00:26:16,689 --> 00:26:18,704
MAN: Copy that. I've got eyes on Raptor.

626
00:26:18,706 --> 00:26:20,972
MAN 2: Hello, Mrs. Florrick.

627
00:26:22,811 --> 00:26:24,543
RUTH: Mrs. Florrick, hello.

628
00:26:24,545 --> 00:26:26,744
I don't think we've met. I'm Ruth Eastman,

629
00:26:26,746 --> 00:26:28,413
your son's campaign manager.

630
00:26:28,415 --> 00:26:31,416
Oh, I love that purse.
It's very attractive.

631
00:26:31,418 --> 00:26:34,319
Thank you. I need to speak to my son.

632
00:26:34,321 --> 00:26:36,754
Oh, he's in a meeting right now.
Why don't we talk for a minute?

633
00:26:36,756 --> 00:26:38,663
I was just pouring some tea.

634
00:26:38,693 --> 00:26:42,749
I'd love to. And maybe
after I speak to my son.

635
00:26:42,779 --> 00:26:45,062
Actually, I'm afraid it's
our standing staff meeting.

636
00:26:45,064 --> 00:26:47,557
Every Tuesday, come hell or high water.

637
00:26:48,419 --> 00:26:49,472
Peter?

638
00:26:49,502 --> 00:26:51,202
Unfortunately, that won't work.

639
00:26:51,394 --> 00:26:52,703
Our aides are instructed:

640
00:26:52,705 --> 00:26:54,604
no interruptions, no exceptions.

641
00:26:54,606 --> 00:26:56,872
Just give 'em 20 minutes. Come on.

642
00:26:56,874 --> 00:26:59,041
Why don't we get better acquainted in here?

643
00:26:59,043 --> 00:27:00,810
(Phone rings)

644
00:27:00,812 --> 00:27:02,445
Oh, excuse me. Um...

645
00:27:02,447 --> 00:27:04,680
excuse me. Let me answer
this, and we'll talk.

646
00:27:04,682 --> 00:27:06,382
It'll just be a minute.

647
00:27:06,596 --> 00:27:07,835
Hello.

648
00:27:10,521 --> 00:27:12,412
(Indistinct chatter)

649
00:27:13,819 --> 00:27:17,993
BRINTON: Yes, I prescribed ten grams
of pentobarbital liquid to Alexa.

650
00:27:17,995 --> 00:27:20,362
And what steps did you
take before prescribing it?

651
00:27:20,364 --> 00:27:23,532
I examined Alexa and determined
she had a terminal illness

652
00:27:23,534 --> 00:27:26,141
that would likely cause
death within six months.

653
00:27:26,171 --> 00:27:28,502
- And, of course, I talked to her.
- About what?

654
00:27:28,532 --> 00:27:31,305
Whether this was voluntary.
Whether it was what

655
00:27:31,307 --> 00:27:32,945
she wanted. If she was depressed.

656
00:27:32,975 --> 00:27:33,941
CANNING: Sounds thorough.

657
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:34,948
BRINTON: I try to be.

658
00:27:34,978 --> 00:27:36,911
- (Phone buzzes)
- The law requires we discuss every danger

659
00:27:36,913 --> 00:27:38,679
and issue before we prescribe.

660
00:27:38,681 --> 00:27:41,511
But more than that, I thought
it was my responsibility.

661
00:27:41,847 --> 00:27:43,097
CANNING: Thank you.

662
00:27:43,127 --> 00:27:45,696
Dr. Brinton, the law also says

663
00:27:45,726 --> 00:27:48,423
that patients need to be
advised of their alternatives.

664
00:27:48,453 --> 00:27:50,696
Did you tell Alexa about the Duke study?

665
00:27:50,726 --> 00:27:53,192
That's not what the law means.
It means like hospice care.

666
00:27:53,194 --> 00:27:54,927
So you didn't tell her
about the Duke study?

667
00:27:55,378 --> 00:27:56,955
- BRINTON: No.
- But you knew about it?

668
00:27:56,985 --> 00:27:59,165
I knew it was in its
early stages, but the odds

669
00:27:59,167 --> 00:28:01,668
of success were very
low. At best, one in 20.

670
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:03,836
I didn't want to give her false hope.

671
00:28:05,307 --> 00:28:06,772
- False hope?
- Yes.

672
00:28:06,774 --> 00:28:09,307
Patients look for any scrap
of good news from a doctor.

673
00:28:09,309 --> 00:28:11,217
But there was good news, wasn't there?

674
00:28:11,247 --> 00:28:13,412
- Not in my opinion.
- Don't you think

675
00:28:13,414 --> 00:28:15,547
the person who should have
been making that ultimate call

676
00:28:15,549 --> 00:28:18,843
- was Alexa and not you?
- Objection.

677
00:28:18,873 --> 00:28:20,239
Badgering.

678
00:28:20,603 --> 00:28:23,200
Pointed, yes. Badgering, no. Overruled.

679
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:24,476
BRINTON: She did make the ultimate call.

680
00:28:24,506 --> 00:28:26,791
Yes, but not with all of the information.

681
00:28:26,793 --> 00:28:27,826
It wouldn't have made a difference.

682
00:28:27,856 --> 00:28:29,360
You don't know that.

683
00:28:34,876 --> 00:28:37,367
I looked at the arrest records
out of the department store.

684
00:28:37,369 --> 00:28:39,235
It's almost all African-Americans.

685
00:28:39,237 --> 00:28:41,805
- There's a racist security guard?
- Or a spotter.

686
00:28:42,034 --> 00:28:44,107
- What's a spotter?
- It's an undercover shopper

687
00:28:44,109 --> 00:28:46,878
who keeps an eye out for shoplifters.

688
00:28:46,908 --> 00:28:48,678
It's also possible the spotters

689
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,947
are targeting African-Americans just to...

690
00:28:50,949 --> 00:28:53,616
keep 'em away. It's like the
New York stores last year.

691
00:28:53,947 --> 00:28:55,017
Couple of 'em settled

692
00:28:55,019 --> 00:28:57,586
an attorney general's investigation...

693
00:28:59,369 --> 00:29:00,523
What?

694
00:29:01,099 --> 00:29:02,925
That's her.

695
00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:04,993
That's one of the ones they targeted.

696
00:29:04,995 --> 00:29:06,562
The goal is to get you out of here.

697
00:29:06,564 --> 00:29:08,764
So your best move is to
plea and pay your fine.

698
00:29:08,766 --> 00:29:10,732
- But I didn't steal anything.
- Ms. Todd...

699
00:29:10,734 --> 00:29:13,835
Betty, you'll make your life a
lot easier if you do what I say.

700
00:29:13,837 --> 00:29:16,270
Let me talk to the
prosecutor, plead it out.

701
00:29:19,351 --> 00:29:20,775
- Don't plead her out.
- What?

702
00:29:20,777 --> 00:29:22,209
- Why?
- SCHAKOWSKY: Female 62.

703
00:29:22,211 --> 00:29:23,764
I-I need 30 seconds with Matan

704
00:29:23,794 --> 00:29:25,141
- on this one, Your Honor.
- You get 20.

705
00:29:25,171 --> 00:29:26,781
Salvatori's, the department store,

706
00:29:26,783 --> 00:29:28,768
it's targeting African-Americans.

707
00:29:28,798 --> 00:29:30,773
- She didn't do it.
- Uh-uh, Alicia. This isn't your case.

708
00:29:30,803 --> 00:29:33,236
- Back the hell off.
- But I have a witness who can testify.

709
00:29:33,238 --> 00:29:34,900
I don't care. You're slowing things down.

710
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:36,725
Can I change attorneys?

711
00:29:36,755 --> 00:29:38,021
Uh...

712
00:29:42,095 --> 00:29:43,280
(Door opens)

713
00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:45,481
(Indistinct chatter)

714
00:29:55,756 --> 00:29:57,765
Mom. I didn't know you were coming in.

715
00:29:57,795 --> 00:30:00,162
- I didn't realize I needed an appointment.
- Oh,

716
00:30:00,164 --> 00:30:02,797
of course you don't. No, please, sit, sit.

717
00:30:03,564 --> 00:30:06,901
I'd rather stand, Peter.
It's hard enough to...

718
00:30:07,678 --> 00:30:10,446
Uh, I came here

719
00:30:10,476 --> 00:30:13,575
intending to discuss an issue
of real importance to me,

720
00:30:13,577 --> 00:30:15,344
but now, uh...

721
00:30:16,682 --> 00:30:18,530
Well, your campaign manager,

722
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:21,282
Ms. Eastman, is not serving you well.

723
00:30:21,284 --> 00:30:23,417
And she's disrespecting me.

724
00:30:23,879 --> 00:30:26,593
Now, whether you were
state's attorney or governor,

725
00:30:26,623 --> 00:30:29,198
I still always had access to you.

726
00:30:29,228 --> 00:30:31,068
But now, with this presidential run...

727
00:30:31,098 --> 00:30:32,159
Nothing's changed, Mom.

728
00:30:32,161 --> 00:30:33,830
suddenly there's a palace guard

729
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:35,828
wearing a pantsuit and cheap shoes,

730
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:37,204
and she showed no remorse...

731
00:30:37,234 --> 00:30:38,431
- Mom, I think maybe...
- No, Peter,

732
00:30:38,433 --> 00:30:40,066
listen to me.

733
00:30:40,068 --> 00:30:41,935
She needs to get her priorities straight,

734
00:30:41,937 --> 00:30:44,070
or you need to dismiss her.

735
00:30:45,986 --> 00:30:48,519
Okay, I will talk to Ruth.

736
00:30:49,933 --> 00:30:53,545
Do you want to now discuss this
issue of importance with me?

737
00:30:54,808 --> 00:30:55,963
(Scoffs)

738
00:30:55,993 --> 00:30:58,383
No, I... I can't. Not in this state.

739
00:30:58,385 --> 00:31:01,052
- We'll have to talk about it another time.
- Okay.

740
00:31:01,054 --> 00:31:02,975
Just so you know, I have
to go back to Iowa...

741
00:31:03,005 --> 00:31:06,291
Oh, Mrs. Florrick, hi again...

742
00:31:08,744 --> 00:31:11,529
I just wanted to let you know
that your daughter stopped by,

743
00:31:11,531 --> 00:31:14,331
wanting to talk to you about the
physician-assisted suicide bill.

744
00:31:14,333 --> 00:31:15,783
- But I handled it.
- You what?

745
00:31:15,813 --> 00:31:17,768
What do you mean you handled it?

746
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:19,670
First, you come between
a mother and her son,

747
00:31:19,672 --> 00:31:21,606
and now you feel comfortable
coming between a son

748
00:31:21,608 --> 00:31:22,714
and his daughter?

749
00:31:22,744 --> 00:31:25,442
RUTH: Oh, no, no, no.
That's not what I mean.

750
00:31:26,435 --> 00:31:28,702
CANNING: Is that why your
wife wanted to end her life,

751
00:31:28,732 --> 00:31:31,247
- because of the pain?
- Yes.

752
00:31:32,351 --> 00:31:35,084
Um, she was afraid she was
losing control over her life.

753
00:31:35,473 --> 00:31:37,787
CANNING: Ms. Lockhart
has spoken a lot about

754
00:31:37,789 --> 00:31:40,490
this Duke brain tumor study.

755
00:31:41,174 --> 00:31:42,058
Would that have changed

756
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:43,726
- Alexa's mind if she knew about it?
- Objection.

757
00:31:43,728 --> 00:31:45,494
- Calls for speculation.
- Goes to state of mind,

758
00:31:45,496 --> 00:31:47,062
- Your Honor.
- Overruled.

759
00:31:47,403 --> 00:31:49,264
Alexa was beyond hope.

760
00:31:49,266 --> 00:31:52,300
She said she wanted to
go out on her own terms.

761
00:31:52,604 --> 00:31:54,670
CANNING: Thank you.

762
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:56,972
ALICIA: Thank you for coming today.

763
00:31:56,974 --> 00:31:59,875
And, Mr. Crouse, can you please
describe what you witnessed?

764
00:32:01,246 --> 00:32:03,545
Ms. Todd being followed by a spotter

765
00:32:03,547 --> 00:32:06,948
and arrested, despite the
fact she didn't steal anything.

766
00:32:07,485 --> 00:32:08,950
Thank you.

767
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:15,723
Mr. Crouse, were you disbarred as a lawyer

768
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:17,496
six years ago?

769
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:19,758
I was.

770
00:32:20,961 --> 00:32:23,063
Because you punched a judge after he found

771
00:32:23,065 --> 00:32:25,165
- a client of yours guilty.
- Objection. Relevance.

772
00:32:25,167 --> 00:32:26,867
Overruled. Let's keep this moving.

773
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,384
Yes.

774
00:32:29,414 --> 00:32:31,304
MATAN: And were you not
investigated by the bar

775
00:32:31,306 --> 00:32:32,739
four different times before then

776
00:32:32,741 --> 00:32:33,874
for altering evidence,

777
00:32:33,876 --> 00:32:35,641
- Objection!
- all in an effort

778
00:32:35,643 --> 00:32:38,243
- to prove your clients were innocent?
- This is beyond the pale.

779
00:32:38,245 --> 00:32:39,879
It's character assassination 101.

780
00:32:39,881 --> 00:32:41,411
I don't care.

781
00:32:41,441 --> 00:32:43,499
- Overruled.
- Why should we believe your account

782
00:32:43,529 --> 00:32:45,007
- of what happened to Ms. Todd?
- Objection.

783
00:32:45,037 --> 00:32:46,963
Mr. Crouse's background has no bearing

784
00:32:46,993 --> 00:32:50,489
- on what he witnessed.
- And yet in my mind, it does.

785
00:32:51,195 --> 00:32:53,825
Why should you believe my account?

786
00:32:54,364 --> 00:32:56,127
Because I'm telling the truth.

787
00:32:56,395 --> 00:32:58,129
Of course you are.

788
00:33:00,809 --> 00:33:02,304
BUKOVITZ: No, no, I'm your lawyer.

789
00:33:02,334 --> 00:33:05,196
- You can't change lawyers now.
- I don't want <i>you.</i> I want <i>that</i> lady.

790
00:33:05,226 --> 00:33:07,189
WOMAN: Yeah. You should be
doing what <i>she</i> is.

791
00:33:07,219 --> 00:33:09,004
Look, I don't care what
Mrs. Florrick is doing.

792
00:33:09,034 --> 00:33:10,913
The best way to get out is to plead.

793
00:33:10,943 --> 00:33:13,644
Sure. If that's what you want.

794
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:18,407
Congratulations.

795
00:33:18,437 --> 00:33:19,993
You've just stolen another client.

796
00:33:20,023 --> 00:33:22,119
No, I didn't... I wasn't...

797
00:33:33,616 --> 00:33:35,750
JACKIE: Grace, if you believe
in the sanctity of life...

798
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:38,393
- It's not a choice, Grandma.
- That's what the Bible commands.

799
00:33:38,423 --> 00:33:39,625
I went to Sunday school, dear.

800
00:33:39,655 --> 00:33:41,646
All right, I think what
Grandma's trying to say,

801
00:33:41,676 --> 00:33:43,442
Grace, is that, when it come to euthanasia,

802
00:33:43,444 --> 00:33:45,807
there is <i>possibly</i>
a broader imperative.

803
00:33:45,837 --> 00:33:48,554
I can speak for myself, thank you.

804
00:33:48,584 --> 00:33:51,283
Grace, all religions preach respect

805
00:33:51,285 --> 00:33:53,216
for every human being.

806
00:33:53,246 --> 00:33:55,325
Which means respecting their choices,

807
00:33:55,355 --> 00:33:56,954
including those about end of life.

808
00:33:56,956 --> 00:33:58,623
But if there's a higher authority...

809
00:33:58,625 --> 00:34:00,225
Then he wouldn't want someone

810
00:34:00,227 --> 00:34:01,659
with end-stage ovarian cancer

811
00:34:01,661 --> 00:34:03,294
- to go on suffering.
- (Intercom beeps)

812
00:34:03,296 --> 00:34:06,163
(Over intercom): Governor,
your wife is on the line.

813
00:34:06,165 --> 00:34:08,599
Grace, on this issue I understand that...

814
00:34:08,601 --> 00:34:09,966
Alicia, hi.

815
00:34:10,527 --> 00:34:11,649
Oh.

816
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:12,969
Veronica. Hello.

817
00:34:12,971 --> 00:34:15,337
- They told me that...
- GRACE: No, but then, all of a sudden,

818
00:34:15,367 --> 00:34:17,167
if we start... if that's
something that we have to decide...

819
00:34:17,197 --> 00:34:19,048
Uh, well, I appreciate
it, but I already have

820
00:34:19,078 --> 00:34:21,911
all the research on the
physician-assisted suicide bill.

821
00:34:21,941 --> 00:34:24,213
- Yes.
- JACKIE: We're talking about the doctors.

822
00:34:24,748 --> 00:34:26,049
Oh, well, I have to go, Veronica,

823
00:34:26,051 --> 00:34:28,617
but I will tell Alicia
that we talked. Thanks.

824
00:34:31,361 --> 00:34:32,790
What the hell's going on today?

825
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:35,162
When one family member
shows up, it's a surprise.

826
00:34:35,192 --> 00:34:37,092
When two do, it's a coincidence.

827
00:34:37,094 --> 00:34:39,661
When three show up, it's <i>Eli.</i>

828
00:34:39,663 --> 00:34:41,126
He's messing with me, Governor.

829
00:34:41,156 --> 00:34:42,469
I don't care.

830
00:34:42,499 --> 00:34:44,933
Do you hear me? I don't give a damn.

831
00:34:44,935 --> 00:34:47,335
Your little skirmishes are not my problem.

832
00:34:47,337 --> 00:34:50,505
I am running for the most
powerful office in the world.

833
00:34:50,808 --> 00:34:54,409
I need you to fix this, and I
need you to fix this right now.

834
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,144
JACKIE: It's never been our choice.

835
00:34:57,146 --> 00:35:00,581
(Grace and Jackie continue arguing)

836
00:35:01,341 --> 00:35:03,217
One of our people found it.

837
00:35:04,505 --> 00:35:07,555
They must have dug pretty deep for this.

838
00:35:07,777 --> 00:35:10,624
Anything to help the cause, Ms. Lockhart.

839
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:14,060
Who is Karen Casavant?

840
00:35:16,133 --> 00:35:17,776
- Mr. Stoke?
- She's my friend.

841
00:35:17,806 --> 00:35:19,099
- Your girlfriend?
- Objection.

842
00:35:19,101 --> 00:35:21,150
- Relevance.
- Goes to bias, Your Honor.

843
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:23,590
- Overruled.
- When did you start seeing

844
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:25,071
Ms. Casavant, sir?

845
00:35:26,005 --> 00:35:27,006
Seven months ago.

846
00:35:27,008 --> 00:35:30,809
So a month before Alexa committed suicide?

847
00:35:34,046 --> 00:35:35,880
(Heavy sigh)

848
00:35:36,688 --> 00:35:37,616
Oh.

849
00:35:37,618 --> 00:35:39,084
Sorry to scare you, honey.

850
00:35:39,086 --> 00:35:41,019
No, it's fine. Just...

851
00:35:41,414 --> 00:35:43,503
There are actually over
60 different Bible verses

852
00:35:43,533 --> 00:35:45,390
that make it clear how precious life is.

853
00:35:45,392 --> 00:35:48,626
Genesis 2:7. Acts 17:25.

854
00:35:49,348 --> 00:35:51,562
Lutheran Church of Hope, born and raised.

855
00:35:51,908 --> 00:35:53,726
I know where you're coming from.

856
00:35:54,777 --> 00:35:56,334
RUTH: My nephew Andrew just joined

857
00:35:56,336 --> 00:35:58,002
the Marines right out of high school.

858
00:35:58,004 --> 00:36:00,738
He could have been going
to an Ivy League college.

859
00:36:00,918 --> 00:36:04,073
Instead, he'll be doing push-ups
in the mud on Paris Island.

860
00:36:04,075 --> 00:36:06,176
But it's what he needs right now.

861
00:36:06,492 --> 00:36:08,417
An ordering principle for his life.

862
00:36:08,447 --> 00:36:09,784
Something to believe in.

863
00:36:09,814 --> 00:36:12,282
I... I-I don't understand.

864
00:36:12,284 --> 00:36:13,967
Your granddaughter Grace.

865
00:36:13,997 --> 00:36:15,785
If they're not idealistic at that age,

866
00:36:15,787 --> 00:36:17,521
when can they be?

867
00:36:17,793 --> 00:36:19,989
RUTH: You're always gonna
have your dad's ear, Grace.

868
00:36:20,191 --> 00:36:23,058
And I promise you, you're
always going to have mine, too.

869
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:25,060
We need you on this campaign.

870
00:36:25,596 --> 00:36:26,762
<i>You're always going to have</i>

871
00:36:26,764 --> 00:36:28,225
your boy's ear, Mrs. Florrick.

872
00:36:28,255 --> 00:36:31,767
And I promise you you're
always gonna have mine, too.

873
00:36:31,769 --> 00:36:36,071
I'm realizing we need you on this campaign.

874
00:36:36,073 --> 00:36:37,972
Yes. Thank you.

875
00:36:37,974 --> 00:36:40,107
And I'll tell you something for nothing.

876
00:36:40,109 --> 00:36:42,677
The smartest men listen to their women.

877
00:36:43,469 --> 00:36:45,647
And the smartest women...

878
00:36:45,947 --> 00:36:48,549
are those with more
than a little experience.

879
00:36:48,551 --> 00:36:49,948
Am I right?

880
00:36:51,279 --> 00:36:53,387
This is a list of the
clients I'm representing,

881
00:36:53,417 --> 00:36:56,356
all of whom were arrested
for theft at your store.

882
00:36:56,358 --> 00:36:58,545
You'll notice that a
disproportionate number

883
00:36:58,575 --> 00:37:00,577
are African-Americans.

884
00:37:00,607 --> 00:37:02,862
This is the kind of thing
the <i>Sun-Times</i> eats up,

885
00:37:02,864 --> 00:37:06,232
especially when there's
rumblings of a class action.

886
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:10,103
On the other hand, if I could
see some security tape...

887
00:37:13,807 --> 00:37:16,175
(Long sigh)

888
00:37:16,354 --> 00:37:18,750
The only thing more boring
than watching security footage

889
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:20,528
is nothing.

890
00:37:21,706 --> 00:37:23,882
It's the best viewing in the world.

891
00:37:23,884 --> 00:37:27,486
This gives you real insight
into human character.

892
00:37:33,255 --> 00:37:35,627
So you beat up a judge?

893
00:37:38,243 --> 00:37:39,369
I hit a judge.

894
00:37:39,917 --> 00:37:41,366
I <i>wanted</i> to beat up a judge,

895
00:37:41,368 --> 00:37:43,968
but I got tackled after the first punch.

896
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:49,373
Hmm. Anger issues, maybe?

897
00:37:49,375 --> 00:37:51,575
I am the calmest, sweetest man

898
00:37:51,577 --> 00:37:53,811
on the face of the earth.

899
00:37:54,182 --> 00:37:55,912
But there are times...

900
00:37:55,914 --> 00:37:58,281
- (Chuckles)
- And there are people

901
00:37:58,283 --> 00:38:01,618
that sometimes just don't listen to reason.

902
00:38:07,315 --> 00:38:10,192
Do I need to worry about you?

903
00:38:11,718 --> 00:38:13,052
Yeah.

904
00:38:14,003 --> 00:38:15,765
Seriously, now.

905
00:38:15,962 --> 00:38:18,628
Why do you think you got me so cheap?

906
00:38:22,171 --> 00:38:24,539
There's your client.

907
00:38:30,453 --> 00:38:32,013
ALICIA: Where is she going, the register?

908
00:38:32,015 --> 00:38:33,088
Hard to tell from here.

909
00:38:33,118 --> 00:38:35,499
Let's try a different angle.

910
00:38:43,879 --> 00:38:48,161
Well, that's unfortunate...
we can't see what she's doing.

911
00:38:49,209 --> 00:38:50,931
Wha-What are you doing?

912
00:38:50,933 --> 00:38:53,533
JASON: The day the mom bought the sweater.

913
00:38:53,535 --> 00:38:55,402
ALICIA: Smart.

914
00:38:57,297 --> 00:38:59,071
JASON: That's her.

915
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:02,742
Huh.

916
00:39:04,499 --> 00:39:07,013
Not what I expected.

917
00:39:13,916 --> 00:39:15,721
I don't believe this.

918
00:39:16,749 --> 00:39:17,923
The only way to get you off

919
00:39:17,925 --> 00:39:20,706
is to show this video to the judge.

920
00:39:21,722 --> 00:39:24,129
And she gets hauled into court?

921
00:39:25,867 --> 00:39:29,584
And that judge calls her number
in front of all those people.

922
00:39:29,614 --> 00:39:30,833
Yes.

923
00:39:33,032 --> 00:39:34,906
(Long sigh)

924
00:39:36,557 --> 00:39:38,173
I'll take the plea.

925
00:39:48,083 --> 00:39:49,416
What's next?

926
00:39:49,618 --> 00:39:53,006
Just closing statements
and crossing of fingers.

927
00:39:53,036 --> 00:39:56,154
I trust in good arguments,
not magical happenings.

928
00:39:56,184 --> 00:39:59,195
- What?
- Why is he back here?

929
00:40:03,791 --> 00:40:05,234
CANNING: Did your wife have an account

930
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:07,703
- on the Web site Scabbit?
- Yes.

931
00:40:10,503 --> 00:40:12,321
Can you see that okay?

932
00:40:12,351 --> 00:40:16,311
Let's look at this posting she made May 12.

933
00:40:16,879 --> 00:40:18,213
Can you read that?

934
00:40:18,378 --> 00:40:19,456
STOKE: "Garbage."

935
00:40:19,486 --> 00:40:22,017
"Garbage" with an exclamation point.

936
00:40:22,248 --> 00:40:23,919
Now let's just scroll up and see

937
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:26,186
what thread she was responding to.

938
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:30,574
Now, you see that? Can you read that?

939
00:40:30,604 --> 00:40:33,049
STOKE: "Duke University
Brain Tumor Center offers hope

940
00:40:33,079 --> 00:40:36,030
- for polio cure"
- So Alexa <i>did</i> know

941
00:40:36,032 --> 00:40:38,531
about the potential treatment
and still made the decision

942
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:42,036
that the slim chance of
success wasn't worth it.

943
00:40:44,305 --> 00:40:45,689
(Door bangs into desk)

944
00:40:45,719 --> 00:40:47,127
Ruth. Come in.

945
00:40:47,157 --> 00:40:50,199
Oh. I don't want to interrupt you, Eli.

946
00:40:50,229 --> 00:40:52,245
I just wanted to say thank you.

947
00:40:52,247 --> 00:40:54,166
I know you were trying to make my life hell

948
00:40:54,196 --> 00:40:57,291
by siccing all those Florricks
on me. But you know what?

949
00:40:57,321 --> 00:40:58,846
We worked through it.

950
00:40:58,876 --> 00:41:02,620
And it wound up bringing me a

So thank you.

I'm good at what I do.

You want to get me,

you'll have to bring your "A" game.

Open or closed?

Or I guess it doesn't matter.

You came in second in perps by the pound.

961

All the bar attorneys
think I'm a slimy bitch

I also gave up a possible class action suit

The way I see it, you have two problems.

968
00:41:48,967 --> 00:41:52,634
One... you spend too
much time on your cases.

969
00:41:53,124 --> 00:41:55,494
Which is why you'll always
be a disaster in bond court.

Nope.

973
00:42:01,379 --> 00:42:02,811
One problem.

974
00:42:03,126 --> 00:42:04,473
What were you gonna say?

975
00:42:04,503 --> 00:42:07,916
No. You'll wear it as a badge of honor.

976

Oh, come on. Now you have to say.

You care too much.

There.

How's that? Happy?

Not really.

There's no glory in this slog, Alicia.

Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
