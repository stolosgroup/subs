I can move down.

I'm not wearing a camera.

21
00:01:26,595 --> 00:01:27,794
Oh, how considerate.

22
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:29,806
Let's skip the hostility, please.

23
00:01:29,848 --> 00:01:32,232
She went out of her way to
make us look like bigots.

00:01:32,234 --> 00:01:34,861
I think I'm being pretty friendly,
considering.

25
00:01:34,946 --> 00:01:36,947
I can see you went with
diversity in hiring.

26

How are Biff and Skippy?

27
00:01:38,474 --> 00:01:40,799
Mike and Brian.

28
00:01:40,873 --> 00:01:42,182
What can we do for you, Monica?

29
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:44,831
I can't imagine that
you're here to apologize.

30
00:01:45,327 --> 00:01:47,068
A friend of mine was
recently run out of business

31
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:48,577
by a giant tech company.

32
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:49,464
I'm bringing suit.

33
00:01:49,506 --> 00:01:51,997
And you don't have the resources
to pursue the case on your own?

34
00:01:52,018 --> 00:01:53,179
You said to call if I needed help.

35
00:01:53,221 --> 00:01:54,688
You've complicated our relationship

36
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:56,456
- since I made that offer.
- True.

37
00:01:56,634 --> 00:01:59,388
But at least we know we can
be direct with each other.

38
00:01:59,589 --> 00:02:01,911
Besides, it could be good for your image.

39
00:02:01,964 --> 00:02:03,497
- How?
- The company I'm suing is even

40
00:02:03,499 --> 00:02:05,566
more lacking in diversity than yours.

41
00:02:05,568 --> 00:02:07,167
And what company is that?

42
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:09,138
Chumhum.

43
00:02:09,718 --> 00:02:11,471
And you want us to help?

44
00:02:11,473 --> 00:02:13,173
Well, actually, I need Lucca to help,
but I know you two

45
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:15,671
have this Bert and Ernie thing going.

46
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:18,011
Well, why me?

47
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:20,814
Alicia's the one that's
worked with Chumhum.

48
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:23,537
Well, it's a racism case.

49
00:02:23,611 --> 00:02:26,553
And, uh,
my firm's a little pale at the moment.

50
00:02:26,555 --> 00:02:28,522
What an honor.
My parents would be so proud.

51
00:02:28,524 --> 00:02:30,383
Who's suing?

52
00:02:30,699 --> 00:02:32,693
Woman: We used to book up weeks in advance.

53
00:02:32,695 --> 00:02:35,333
Our venison pot pie was
written up in the<i> Trib.</i>

54
00:02:35,396 --> 00:02:37,032
We were Zagat rated.

55
00:02:37,306 --> 00:02:38,899
Then people just stopped coming.

56
00:02:38,901 --> 00:02:41,648
It's hard not to take it
personally when it's your baby.

57
00:02:41,722 --> 00:02:43,559
And why is Chumhum responsible?

58
00:02:43,622 --> 00:02:46,039
Their maps program... Chummy Maps...

59
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:48,424
It's supposed to help users stay safe

60
00:02:48,477 --> 00:02:49,676
by giving them directions

61
00:02:49,678 --> 00:02:52,646
to avoid the dangerous parts of the city.

62
00:02:52,648 --> 00:02:55,192
Green's safe, yellow's so-so,

63
00:02:55,255 --> 00:02:57,503
and red means "stay away."

64
00:02:57,535 --> 00:02:58,652
When the filter's on,

65
00:02:58,654 --> 00:03:00,887
driving directions avoid the red areas.

66
00:03:01,312 --> 00:03:04,090
The filter is always on by default.

67
00:03:04,092 --> 00:03:05,597
You have to manually turn it off.

68
00:03:05,628 --> 00:03:07,117
So you lost your foot traffic?

69
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:08,003
And this...

70
00:03:08,014 --> 00:03:10,612
Watch when I toggle the filter on and off.

71
00:03:10,718 --> 00:03:12,902
Monica: It doesn't show businesses
in the red parts of the map.

72
00:03:12,976 --> 00:03:15,140
When this came out, it
was like I didn't exist.

73
00:03:15,203 --> 00:03:16,902
It says this is an unsafe area?

74
00:03:16,972 --> 00:03:18,897
Yes, a red zone.

75
00:03:22,384 --> 00:03:23,377
It doesn't feel unsafe.

76
00:03:23,379 --> 00:03:25,635
Monica: Yes, except for one thing.

77
00:03:26,194 --> 00:03:27,748
Too many people of color.

78
00:03:28,157 --> 00:03:30,078
Man: <i>Our maps are not racist.</i>

79
00:03:30,152 --> 00:03:31,585
It's run by an algorithm.

80
00:03:31,587 --> 00:03:33,654
And math is not racist.

81
00:03:33,656 --> 00:03:36,523
Chumhum is very proud of
its diversity and openness.

82
00:03:36,525 --> 00:03:38,125
Diana: And yet their Safe Filter

83
00:03:38,127 --> 00:03:39,660
deters people from patronizing businesses

84
00:03:39,662 --> 00:03:41,161
in African-American neighborhoods.

85
00:03:41,163 --> 00:03:42,696
Lucca: Chumhum is not responsible

86
00:03:42,698 --> 00:03:45,265
for the actions of those
who respond to its software.

87
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:47,499
It was Ms. Feldman's choice
to open a four-star restaurant

88
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,840
in a marginal neighborhood, not ours.

89
00:03:48,903 --> 00:03:51,672
It isn't a marginal neighborhood,
It's a black neighborhood.

90
00:03:51,674 --> 00:03:52,939
Well, it's both, which really

91
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:55,676
- isn't that uncommon.
- Wait, what?!

92
00:03:55,678 --> 00:03:57,753
Well,
he's not saying anything that unusual.

93
00:03:57,806 --> 00:03:59,613
Look at crime rates. Look at home values.

94
00:03:59,615 --> 00:04:02,416
And look at the biracial lawyer
pimping for a racist system.

95
00:04:02,418 --> 00:04:04,518
Excuse me?! Are you actually saying...?

96
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,286
(all talking at once)

97
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:07,654
- Let's not make this personal, guys.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

98
00:04:07,656 --> 00:04:09,372
Hey, wait.

99
00:04:09,815 --> 00:04:11,693
Chumhum will admit no wrongdoing.

100
00:04:11,746 --> 00:04:14,933
But in the spirit of making
this world a better place,

101
00:04:14,975 --> 00:04:18,265
Mr. Harman is willing to
offer Ms. Feldman $50,000

102
00:04:18,267 --> 00:04:20,200
to open a new restaurant
anywhere she wants.

103
00:04:20,202 --> 00:04:21,935
- Consider it a gesture.
- Monica: What gesture is that?

104
00:04:21,937 --> 00:04:23,070
The finger?

105
00:04:23,072 --> 00:04:25,772
Chumhum is worth 300 billion.

106
00:04:25,774 --> 00:04:27,407
I know how much my company is worth,
thank you.

107
00:04:27,409 --> 00:04:29,009
Cary:
Is that because your stock's dropped 22%

108
00:04:29,011 --> 00:04:30,544
since you became COO?

109
00:04:30,546 --> 00:04:32,112
- Harman: Wow, seriously?
- Okay, Cary, you don't need to go there.

110
00:04:32,114 --> 00:04:32,946
Want to fight dirty now?

111
00:04:32,948 --> 00:04:34,448
You know what? You know what?

112
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:35,882
No, we're done!

113
00:04:37,052 --> 00:04:38,485
Your guy's a piece of work.

114
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:40,758
Unfortunately for you,
the law's on his side.

115
00:04:40,842 --> 00:04:42,330
We'll see.

116
00:04:42,594 --> 00:04:44,791
Paige: <i>You're kind of in love with her,</i>
aren't you?

117
00:04:45,203 --> 00:04:46,126
Who?

118
00:04:46,734 --> 00:04:47,831
Alicia.

119
00:04:48,887 --> 00:04:49,830
(scoffs) No.

120
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:52,966
You just talked about her
for the last 30 minutes.

121
00:04:52,968 --> 00:04:54,267
Occupational hazard.

122
00:04:54,269 --> 00:04:55,435
You have to be obsessed
with your candidate,

123
00:04:55,437 --> 00:04:57,142
or you're not doing your job.

124
00:04:57,216 --> 00:04:58,335
"Candidate"?

125
00:05:00,108 --> 00:05:03,009
Well, the question is will the voters think

126
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:05,645
she's still tainted by her scandal?

127
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,106
You're staring at me. I can feel it.

128
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:20,060
I can't help it.

129
00:05:20,905 --> 00:05:22,829
You are very sexy when
you're writing a check.

130
00:05:22,831 --> 00:05:24,135
(laughs)

131
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:31,404
$50,000?

132
00:05:31,406 --> 00:05:33,039
Convene a focus group.

133
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:36,376
See if you've resurrected St. Alicia.

134
00:05:37,369 --> 00:05:38,645
Alicia: <i>But above all else,</i>

135
00:05:38,647 --> 00:05:40,614
I am a mother, and it's as a mother

136
00:05:40,616 --> 00:05:43,950
I am asking for your support, Webster City.

137
00:05:44,716 --> 00:05:47,491
I know ethanol can make a
difference for our children.

138
00:05:47,565 --> 00:05:50,600
So please remember, a vote for Florrick

139
00:05:51,022 --> 00:05:52,795
is a vote for family.

140
00:05:53,175 --> 00:05:53,860
Really?

141
00:05:53,862 --> 00:05:55,462
I feel like I'm pandering to housewives.

142
00:05:55,464 --> 00:05:57,825
Anyone who knows me will smell
the bullcrap a mile away.

143
00:05:57,888 --> 00:05:59,332
Yes, but it's Iowa.

144
00:05:59,577 --> 00:06:01,187
All they smell is bullcrap.

145
00:06:01,305 --> 00:06:04,004
Look, these e-mail blasts
aren't meant to be subtle.

146
00:06:04,006 --> 00:06:05,138
They're a sledgehammer.

147
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,926
So don't pull back.

148
00:06:07,044 --> 00:06:08,746
Okay, what's the next city?

149
00:06:08,865 --> 00:06:10,710
Three, two...

150
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:13,547
Hello, voters of Sioux Center.

151
00:06:14,281 --> 00:06:15,582
I'm Alicia Florrick.

152
00:06:16,141 --> 00:06:17,645
As the mother of two incredible...

153
00:06:17,672 --> 00:06:18,685
(door opens)

154
00:06:18,687 --> 00:06:19,719
um...

155
00:06:19,721 --> 00:06:22,422
(door closes) kids... I, um,

156
00:06:22,738 --> 00:06:23,992
love and adore...

157
00:06:24,084 --> 00:06:25,192
Do you need a minute?

158
00:06:25,194 --> 00:06:27,394
Yeah, it just... thanks.

159
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,298
Hey. Hi.

160
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:31,630
What's wrong?

161
00:06:32,435 --> 00:06:34,201
Uh, nothing.

162
00:06:37,491 --> 00:06:39,852
All right, so I have something to say.

163
00:06:40,354 --> 00:06:41,474
Okay.

164
00:06:41,476 --> 00:06:44,681
Now, we agreed that I would stay freelance,
right?

165
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,111
Yes.

166
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,446
That's how I keep my fee low.

167
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:48,328
And part of that

168
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,281
freelance work has taken me

169
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,629
to Lockhart/Agos.

170
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,763
I know.

171
00:06:53,869 --> 00:06:55,822
Well, clearly you have some

172
00:06:55,824 --> 00:06:58,763
hard feelings toward them,

173
00:06:58,882 --> 00:07:00,360
but, Alicia,

174
00:07:01,146 --> 00:07:03,112
I would never use

175
00:07:03,152 --> 00:07:06,433
- information gleaned from here...
- Oh, no I never thought you would.

176
00:07:06,435 --> 00:07:09,002
But if you have some sort of
issue with this arrangement,

177
00:07:09,004 --> 00:07:10,817
then we should talk, because I need to know

178
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:14,541
whether I can continue working here.

179
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:19,513
I want you to work here.

180
00:07:19,619 --> 00:07:22,048
Even if freelancing takes
me to Lockhart/Agos?

181
00:07:22,656 --> 00:07:24,184
Yes.

182
00:07:24,598 --> 00:07:26,052
Good.

183
00:07:26,751 --> 00:07:29,322
I have something for
your motion to dismiss.

184
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:31,091
Oh, I thought you were gonna say

185
00:07:31,093 --> 00:07:33,693
you were going to
Lockhart/Agos for this case.

186
00:07:34,006 --> 00:07:34,861
No.

187
00:07:35,315 --> 00:07:36,763
Unless you want me to.

188
00:07:36,765 --> 00:07:37,731
No. Shut up.

189
00:07:37,733 --> 00:07:39,733
(both chuckle)

190
00:07:41,352 --> 00:07:42,636
Uh, here.

191
00:07:42,638 --> 00:07:43,637
(laughs)

192
00:07:44,045 --> 00:07:45,372
Thank you.

193
00:07:46,409 --> 00:07:48,875
Judge Marx: <i>You're suing Chumhum</i>
for tortious interference

194
00:07:48,877 --> 00:07:50,729
with prospective economic advantage?

195
00:07:50,782 --> 00:07:53,580
Yes, Your Honor, Chumhum's Safe Filter

196
00:07:53,582 --> 00:07:57,150
creates a racist geofencing
effect that disadvantages

197
00:07:57,152 --> 00:07:59,185
business owners in African- American
neighborhoods.

198
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:01,488
Your Honor, tortious interference requires

199
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:05,118
proof of either purposeful
or knowing interference.

200
00:08:05,182 --> 00:08:07,627
- And there is none here.
- We believe there is, Your Honor.

201
00:08:07,629 --> 00:08:08,828
I'd like to call a witness to show

202
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:11,292
that the intent requirement is not met.

203
00:08:11,504 --> 00:08:15,007
Mr. Harman,
is it possible for Chumhum's Safe Filter

204
00:08:15,073 --> 00:08:17,437
to have a racist intent?

205
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:20,417
No, the filter is powered by two things,
and two things only.

206
00:08:20,496 --> 00:08:22,356
Objective third party statistics...

207
00:08:22,382 --> 00:08:24,282
Uh, crime rates, for example...

208
00:08:24,335 --> 00:08:26,413
And user-generated feedback data.

209
00:08:26,415 --> 00:08:27,981
- Like comments and reviews?
- Yes, exactly.

210
00:08:27,983 --> 00:08:30,483
Which is entirely in the users' hands.

211
00:08:30,485 --> 00:08:32,774
I mean,
there's no way that anyone at Chumhum

212
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,454
could use a Safe Filter

213
00:08:34,456 --> 00:08:37,657
to purposefully interfere
with plaintiff's business?

214
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:39,326
- No, not even if we wanted to.
- Thank you.

215
00:08:39,328 --> 00:08:42,028
Diana: Mr. Harman,
is it true that Chummy Maps

216
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:46,112
is only available on cOS...
Chumhum's own operating system?

217
00:08:46,178 --> 00:08:48,468
- Yes.
- This is a recent study done

218
00:08:48,487 --> 00:08:51,666
by the Internet Research Foundation.

219
00:08:51,891 --> 00:08:53,974
Could you read what it says right there?

220
00:08:53,976 --> 00:08:57,478
Uh, "cOS users are 71%...

221
00:08:57,781 --> 00:08:58,611
Caucasian."

222
00:08:58,613 --> 00:09:01,343
Diana: And what percentage of
cOS users are African-American?

223
00:09:01,396 --> 00:09:03,283
- Does it say?
- Eleven percent.

224
00:09:03,285 --> 00:09:06,119
Diana: And do these numbers
match your own market research?

225
00:09:06,132 --> 00:09:08,989
Chumhum is not to blame for
socioeconomic disparity.

226
00:09:08,991 --> 00:09:11,524
Our products cost more because
they are better products.

227
00:09:11,526 --> 00:09:16,292
So you knew about the disparity
between white and black users?

228
00:09:16,384 --> 00:09:18,631
Harman: Again,
our products are not intentionally

229
00:09:18,633 --> 00:09:20,233
targeted toward Caucasians.

230
00:09:20,235 --> 00:09:22,836
Yes,
but if your user-generated feedback data

231
00:09:22,838 --> 00:09:26,059
is being generated
predominately by white users,

232
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:28,775
doesn't it follow that the
results will be skewed?

233
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:30,744
- Objection, speculation.
- Judge: Perhaps.

234
00:09:30,746 --> 00:09:31,982
And yet I'm still curious.

235
00:09:32,034 --> 00:09:33,438
Harman: Would the results be skewed? No.

236
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:35,063
Diana: Really? If you allow

237
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:37,705
one racial group to dominate a discussion

238
00:09:37,778 --> 00:09:39,636
about what neighborhood is safe,
you don't think

239
00:09:39,678 --> 00:09:41,354
- the results will be skewed?
- Alicia: Objection!

240
00:09:41,356 --> 00:09:43,077
- Asked and answered.
- You're right.

241
00:09:43,129 --> 00:09:44,744
I'm just giving him a chance to rethink.

242
00:09:44,797 --> 00:09:46,771
But it seems he doesn't want to.

243
00:09:46,897 --> 00:09:48,128
Withdrawn.

244
00:09:50,894 --> 00:09:53,322
Purposeful or knowing interference

245
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:55,535
doesn't just mean the defendant<i> knew</i>

246
00:09:55,537 --> 00:09:58,204
his product could have a disparately

247
00:09:58,206 --> 00:09:59,773
racist effect.

248
00:10:00,101 --> 00:10:01,541
It also means...

249
00:10:02,275 --> 00:10:03,543
he should've known.

250
00:10:03,545 --> 00:10:04,544
We lost.

251
00:10:04,546 --> 00:10:06,279
Mr. Harman admits he knew

252
00:10:06,281 --> 00:10:07,614
their data was being generated

253
00:10:07,616 --> 00:10:09,463
primarily by Caucasians,

254
00:10:09,516 --> 00:10:11,351
so an argument can be made

255
00:10:11,353 --> 00:10:12,852
that he should have known

256
00:10:12,854 --> 00:10:14,592
what would result.

257
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:16,056
Ms. Quinn, Mrs. Florrick,

258
00:10:16,058 --> 00:10:18,858
your motion to dismiss is denied.

259
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,186
Request full discovery, Your Honor.

260
00:10:20,249 --> 00:10:21,463
Your Honor!

261
00:10:21,643 --> 00:10:23,630
Plaintiff is only asking for full discovery

262
00:10:23,632 --> 00:10:26,191
in order to force us to settle.

263
00:10:26,402 --> 00:10:29,178
Poking around all of Chumhum's products

264
00:10:29,368 --> 00:10:30,904
would compromise trade secrets.

265
00:10:30,906 --> 00:10:32,705
Judge:
But you can't shut them out entirely.

266
00:10:32,707 --> 00:10:34,741
I'm granting the discovery motion

267
00:10:34,743 --> 00:10:36,209
and limiting it to items

268
00:10:36,211 --> 00:10:38,111
related to racist references

269
00:10:38,113 --> 00:10:39,446
and Chummy Maps.

270
00:10:39,448 --> 00:10:41,181
(gavel bangs)

271
00:10:42,993 --> 00:10:44,284
What do you think?

272
00:10:46,138 --> 00:10:47,056
Small.

273
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:48,688
You don't get claustrophobic in here?

274
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,216
I'm actually starting to like it.

275
00:10:50,269 --> 00:10:52,053
Yeah, Stockholm syndrome.

276
00:10:52,105 --> 00:10:53,927
I meant what do you think
about the focus group?

277
00:10:53,929 --> 00:10:56,211
You want to run her for a senate seat?

278
00:10:56,338 --> 00:10:58,231
- To start.
- Alicia Florrick.

279
00:10:58,233 --> 00:11:00,100
Wife of the Illinois governor?

280
00:11:00,102 --> 00:11:02,860
A woman who stood by her husband
during his worst moments.

281
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:06,573
Housewives... Republican and Democratic.

282
00:11:06,575 --> 00:11:09,102
- And independents.
- How large a sampling?

283
00:11:09,154 --> 00:11:11,793
Whatever I can get for $50,000.
But we have to have

284
00:11:11,859 --> 00:11:14,147
ironclad waivers.
Nobody can know we're doing this.

285
00:11:14,149 --> 00:11:16,723
- Especially not Alicia.
- Why not Alicia?

286
00:11:17,105 --> 00:11:18,718
Because I'm using it to convince her.

287
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,487
(laughing)

288
00:11:20,997 --> 00:11:22,789
Yup, good old Eli. (phone rings)

289
00:11:23,702 --> 00:11:24,902
Yeah.

290
00:11:25,219 --> 00:11:26,855
What's wrong?

291
00:11:40,093 --> 00:11:42,542
Gina, could you come in here?

292
00:11:45,428 --> 00:11:47,420
Do we need the Cone of Silence?

293
00:11:48,357 --> 00:11:50,481
Alicia and Jason Crouse.

294
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:51,885
I have no idea what that means.

295
00:11:51,887 --> 00:11:54,412
Jason Crouse. Alicia's investigator.

296
00:11:54,492 --> 00:11:57,590
- I know who he is...
- Are they having an affair?

297
00:12:00,411 --> 00:12:02,629
No, of course not.

298
00:12:02,971 --> 00:12:04,697
- No.
- He came by the apartment

299
00:12:04,699 --> 00:12:06,699
while I was filming Alicia's Internet ads

300
00:12:06,701 --> 00:12:08,617
and she touched him.

301
00:12:08,762 --> 00:12:10,069
Touched him where?

302
00:12:10,071 --> 00:12:11,440
His arm.

303
00:12:11,743 --> 00:12:12,839
Like a massage?

304
00:12:12,841 --> 00:12:15,308
- No, not like a massage.
- Then let it go.

305
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:18,011
She touched his arm.
People touch each other's arms.

306
00:12:18,013 --> 00:12:20,662
She was smiling at him
like a schoolgirl, Eli.

307
00:12:20,728 --> 00:12:23,850
And not just in front of me...
In front of the whole crew.

308
00:12:27,381 --> 00:12:29,966
Eli, I want to be clear here.

309
00:12:30,164 --> 00:12:33,960
They were touching
in front of strangers with cameras.

310
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:35,528
- Okay, let me look into it.
- Now, we both know

311
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:38,249
Peter's campaign wouldn't withstand
the fallout of something like this.

312
00:12:38,315 --> 00:12:40,228
And Alicia's rehabilitation would certainly

313
00:12:40,281 --> 00:12:42,431
- become a wasted effort.
- Okay, let me handle it.

314
00:12:42,471 --> 00:12:45,175
- Oh, Eli, you didn't even know!
- I said I'd handle it!

315
00:12:49,766 --> 00:12:51,477
(quietly): Oh, damn.

316
00:12:51,706 --> 00:12:54,344
S07E09
Discovery

317
00:12:54,476 --> 00:12:57,049
sync and corrected by ninh
www.addic7ed.com

318
00:13:04,827 --> 00:13:06,657
Alicia:
Judge Marx has ordered limited discovery,

319
00:13:06,723 --> 00:13:09,507
confined to "racist references"
and "Chummy Maps."

320
00:13:09,573 --> 00:13:12,686
We'll split up Chumhum hard drives
and review all e-mails,

321
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,466
software specs and memorandums.

322
00:13:14,468 --> 00:13:17,036
Mark them as either
responsive or nonresponsive.

323
00:13:17,038 --> 00:13:19,571
Uh, how narrowly are we interpreting
"responsive"?

324
00:13:19,573 --> 00:13:22,341
Well, don't want to do
the opposition any favors.

325
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:24,666
Well, any disagreements, we'll discuss.

326
00:13:24,705 --> 00:13:27,379
Good. Call me here. And good luck.

340
00:14:29,792 --> 00:14:31,510
- What?
- March 5 of this year:

341
00:14:31,512 --> 00:14:33,628
"Why do we include home ownership rates?"

342
00:14:33,654 --> 00:14:34,842
In reference to...?

343
00:14:34,881 --> 00:14:36,214
There's no subject line,

344
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,747
but it's in a thread about the Safe Filter.

345
00:14:38,813 --> 00:14:40,554
- Who to who?
- Chummy Map coder

346
00:14:40,633 --> 00:14:42,154
Kip O'Neill to his super,

347
00:14:42,156 --> 00:14:43,747
Larry Melanie.

348
00:14:44,881 --> 00:14:46,946
Damn. I think this one's responsive.

349
00:14:46,973 --> 00:14:48,927
But did they include home ownership rates

350
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:50,295
into the algorithm?

351
00:14:50,297 --> 00:14:51,296
No.

352
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:52,804
So...?

353
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:55,680
- They were considering it.
- Canning:<i> So?</i>

354
00:14:55,736 --> 00:14:58,437
They didn't do it.
Mark it as non-responsive.

355
00:14:58,529 --> 00:14:59,538
Alicia (over phone): Come on.

356
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,607
They discussed including
home ownership rates

357
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:03,675
in the design of Safe Filter.

358
00:15:03,677 --> 00:15:05,210
I mean, that would automatically

359
00:15:05,211 --> 00:15:06,979
disadvantage poorer neighborhoods.

360
00:15:06,981 --> 00:15:08,514
It's a proxy for race.

361
00:15:08,516 --> 00:15:10,149
Canning: Yes, but, again, they didn't,

362
00:15:10,151 --> 00:15:11,717
and so it wasn't.

363
00:15:11,719 --> 00:15:15,420
Well...
let's let the judge rule on its relevance.

364
00:15:15,422 --> 00:15:17,189
Anyway, you sure you're not
misinterpreting this e-mail?

365
00:15:17,191 --> 00:15:18,490
It says,

366
00:15:18,492 --> 00:15:20,859
"Why do we include home ownership rates?"

367
00:15:20,861 --> 00:15:22,702
H-How else do we interpret that?

368
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,763
Maybe the emphasis is on "we."

369
00:15:24,765 --> 00:15:26,569
"Why do<i> we</i> have to be the
ones who have to do this?

370
00:15:26,648 --> 00:15:29,034
Why can't somebody else to do it?"

371
00:15:29,392 --> 00:15:32,838
There's an easy way to
find out what he meant.

372
00:15:34,128 --> 00:15:35,974
Kip O'Neill: <i>Apricot thyme granola</i>

373
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:38,377
or rose pistachio pepita?

374
00:15:38,379 --> 00:15:39,678
We rotate every day.

375
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,014
Almond milk? We make our own.

376
00:15:42,016 --> 00:15:43,415
No, thanks. We're good.

377
00:15:43,417 --> 00:15:46,207
So about those home ownership statistics?

378
00:15:46,259 --> 00:15:49,054
- Yeah, that was just in beta.
- Uh, what was in beta?

379
00:15:49,056 --> 00:15:50,490
Our use of home ownership stats.

380
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:52,239
To determine which
neighborhoods were unsafe?

381
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:54,426
Yeah, but only in beta.

382
00:15:54,428 --> 00:15:56,695
See,
we had to show users something on day one,

383
00:15:56,697 --> 00:15:58,542
before there was any user feedback,

384
00:15:58,648 --> 00:16:00,999
so we used other data just to start it off.

385
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:03,001
So what percentage of the results

386
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:04,770
is currently shaped by user feedback?

387
00:16:04,772 --> 00:16:08,199
100%. We realized that

388
00:16:08,239 --> 00:16:10,442
if we kept it completely in the users'
hands,

389
00:16:10,444 --> 00:16:14,112
we would avoid another "Animal" incident.

390
00:16:14,114 --> 00:16:16,721
Okay, a what incident?

391
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,884
Just something that happened last year

392
00:16:18,886 --> 00:16:20,118
in the imaging department.

393
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,020
We were this close to causing a major

394
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:24,249
- you-know-what storm. I'll show you.
- Uh, no, no. No, no, no.

395
00:16:24,302 --> 00:16:25,791
- I've got my computer...
- No, just stop. It's okay.

396
00:16:25,793 --> 00:16:27,614
- Stop.
- Well, we just can't

397
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:31,708
- pretend he didn't say something.
- No, but he didn't say Chummy Maps.

398
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,534
Um, does this thing that
you were about to show us...

399
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:37,236
- The "Animal" incident?
- Right.

400
00:16:37,238 --> 00:16:39,104
Does it have to do with Chummy Maps?

401
00:16:39,106 --> 00:16:40,906
No,
but we were all worried we were gonna...

402
00:16:40,908 --> 00:16:44,476
- Uh-uh, uh-uh.
- No, no... Don't say anything else, okay?

403
00:16:44,478 --> 00:16:46,612
If it doesn't have to do with the maps,

404
00:16:46,614 --> 00:16:48,116
then we don't have to look at it.

405
00:16:48,168 --> 00:16:50,402
And we really shouldn't look at it.

406
00:16:57,144 --> 00:16:59,024
(scoffs)

407
00:17:00,983 --> 00:17:02,494
What?

408
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:04,338
Something in the discovery?

409
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:07,499
No. The reader comments on Safe Filter.

410
00:17:07,501 --> 00:17:10,369
"Super shady street!" Exclamation point.

411
00:17:10,371 --> 00:17:12,537
"Heard gunshots, never going back!"

412
00:17:12,539 --> 00:17:14,039
Sad face.

413
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:16,441
- You think it's racist?
- Do you?

414
00:17:16,858 --> 00:17:19,461
He heard gunshots. It's not racist.

415
00:17:19,514 --> 00:17:21,915
My guess is he<i> thought</i> he heard gunshots.

416
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:25,293
More discovery from Chumhum.
We'll take half.

417
00:17:25,385 --> 00:17:27,773
Oh, good. Thank you.

418
00:17:27,905 --> 00:17:29,593
So...

419
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:31,556
Biff and, um, Skippy

420
00:17:31,558 --> 00:17:33,600
are working out well for you?

421
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,562
Yes, they are.

422
00:17:37,564 --> 00:17:40,265
- And how is that not reverse racism?
- How is what not...

423
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:41,967
- Making fun of their names?
- Yeah,

424
00:17:41,969 --> 00:17:43,468
calling them white stereotyped names.

425
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:45,103
Is that what Biff and Skippy are?

426
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:48,076
Country club names from
some bad skit somewhere...

427
00:17:48,116 --> 00:17:50,029
Polo outfits and tennis racquets...
don't pretend

428
00:17:50,082 --> 00:17:52,177
like you don't know what I'm talking about.

429
00:17:52,179 --> 00:17:54,752
We don't want to be
having this conversation.

430
00:17:54,831 --> 00:17:58,343
- We already are.
- Yes, reverse racism... that dangerous

431
00:17:58,382 --> 00:18:00,638
- contagion that's taking hold of society.
- It doesn't have to be

432
00:18:00,678 --> 00:18:02,472
a contagion to be true.

433
00:18:03,145 --> 00:18:05,898
- So how is is that not reverse racism?
- Because harm is necessary

434
00:18:05,908 --> 00:18:09,117
for racism to be... harmful.

435
00:18:09,169 --> 00:18:12,097
But you think they're idiots
because they're big white guys?

436
00:18:12,099 --> 00:18:15,387
No, I think they're idiots
because you hired them instead of me.

437
00:18:15,556 --> 00:18:16,868
(Monica laughs)

438
00:18:18,174 --> 00:18:19,538
Can I see your laptop?

439
00:18:20,127 --> 00:18:21,073
Why?

440
00:18:21,075 --> 00:18:23,241
Because I want to steal it.

441
00:18:28,682 --> 00:18:30,015
What?

442
00:18:30,017 --> 00:18:31,463
Banner ads.

443
00:18:31,529 --> 00:18:33,429
This one's my Chumhum account.

444
00:18:33,495 --> 00:18:35,620
And this one's yours.

445
00:18:35,622 --> 00:18:36,796
I get...

446
00:18:36,928 --> 00:18:38,490
soul food

447
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:40,345
and you get...

448
00:18:40,648 --> 00:18:42,244
skiing.

449
00:18:42,733 --> 00:18:43,996
Meaning?

450
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:46,298
Maybe we can expand the discovery.

451
00:18:46,664 --> 00:18:48,533
<i>(doorbell rings)</i>

452
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,738
Alicia's out.

453
00:18:53,897 --> 00:18:54,940
That's fine.

454
00:18:54,942 --> 00:18:56,601
I'll wait for her.

455
00:19:05,584 --> 00:19:07,419
You doing some work?

456
00:19:09,107 --> 00:19:10,355
Yup.

457
00:19:10,703 --> 00:19:12,391
Mind if I ask you a few questions?

458
00:19:12,393 --> 00:19:14,344
- That depends.
- On what?

459
00:19:14,516 --> 00:19:15,727
The questions.

460
00:19:16,952 --> 00:19:18,296
(scoffing chuckle) Married?

461
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:20,799
I am not.

462
00:19:20,801 --> 00:19:23,021
Girlfriend? Kids?

463
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:25,137
I've had girlfriends.

464
00:19:25,139 --> 00:19:26,772
Not had kids.

465
00:19:26,774 --> 00:19:28,463
I have a daughter.

466
00:19:28,938 --> 00:19:30,242
Divorced.

467
00:19:30,244 --> 00:19:31,910
Me, not my daughter.

468
00:19:32,737 --> 00:19:34,446
(forced chuckle)

469
00:19:36,154 --> 00:19:37,416
Sorry for my nosiness.

470
00:19:37,418 --> 00:19:39,333
I just like to know about Alicia

471
00:19:39,413 --> 00:19:41,787
and her life.

472
00:19:42,464 --> 00:19:43,321
No problem.

473
00:19:43,323 --> 00:19:44,990
You know, they're actually paying me now,

474
00:19:44,992 --> 00:19:46,358
so I'm gonna get back to work.

475
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,190
She's getting close to you.

476
00:19:49,456 --> 00:19:50,828
Isn't she?

477
00:19:54,522 --> 00:19:57,869
I think these are questions for Alicia,
not for me.

478
00:19:57,871 --> 00:20:00,290
You understand why I ask?

479
00:20:00,874 --> 00:20:04,042
Her husband is running for president.

480
00:20:04,044 --> 00:20:06,570
There's a lot more attention being paid.

481
00:20:11,952 --> 00:20:14,702
I think these are questions for Alicia,

482
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:16,688
not for me.

483
00:20:19,693 --> 00:20:21,860
Good talking to you.

484
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:28,530
Cary: The ads you're seeing are
for things you might like, right?

485
00:20:28,609 --> 00:20:30,936
Things you search for or shop for online.

486
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:32,771
- That's right.
- And the ads you see

487
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:35,503
are different from the ads that I see?

488
00:20:35,556 --> 00:20:37,109
- Yes, they are.
- Lucca: Your Honor, the ads

489
00:20:37,111 --> 00:20:39,544
are just targeted. Advertisers

490
00:20:39,546 --> 00:20:41,079
tell Chumhum they want to reach people

491
00:20:41,081 --> 00:20:44,025
of a certain age, gender,
ethnic background,

492
00:20:44,065 --> 00:20:45,991
and Chumhum obliges. That's nothing more

493
00:20:46,057 --> 00:20:48,693
than retailers wanting to
reach their customer base.

494
00:20:48,745 --> 00:20:50,249
Opposing counsel's missing the point,
Your Honor.

495
00:20:50,328 --> 00:20:50,988
Am I?

496
00:20:51,058 --> 00:20:52,224
- Tell me.
- The point isn't that

497
00:20:52,226 --> 00:20:53,792
white people get white ads

498
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:55,394
and black people get black ads.

499
00:20:55,434 --> 00:20:57,762
- Because you haven't made that point.
- Cary: The point is the ads

500
00:20:57,764 --> 00:20:59,131
that appear on Chummy Maps

501
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:00,665
extract user data from the entire

502
00:21:00,667 --> 00:21:02,276
Chumhum product suite...

503
00:21:02,329 --> 00:21:05,244
Search engine, e-mails,
chat sites, news feeds, shopping...

504
00:21:05,323 --> 00:21:08,039
- all of it.
- Chumhum is a fully integrated platform.

505
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:09,241
Therefore our discovery shouldn't

506
00:21:09,243 --> 00:21:11,035
be limited to Chummy Maps alone.

507
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,944
It should include all of Chumhum.

508
00:21:12,946 --> 00:21:16,114
Your Honor, that's a hysterical escalation.

509
00:21:16,116 --> 00:21:18,216
It would be a ridiculous
amount of material.

510
00:21:18,218 --> 00:21:19,718
Good thing we can handle it.

511
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,920
To honor your discovery ruling, judge,

512
00:21:21,922 --> 00:21:23,421
we must see everything.

513
00:21:23,423 --> 00:21:24,856
They're right, Mrs. Florrick.

514
00:21:24,858 --> 00:21:27,829
Full discovery of Chumhum is granted.

515
00:21:28,156 --> 00:21:29,327
(gavel bangs)

516
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:31,463
Who's side is the law on again?

517
00:21:36,937 --> 00:21:38,528
(sighs wearily)

518
00:21:39,562 --> 00:21:41,806
Eli,
I just had my ass handed to me in court.

519
00:21:41,808 --> 00:21:44,075
I do not have the bandwidth
for any campaign talk.

520
00:21:44,077 --> 00:21:46,044
This is not about campaign talk.

521
00:21:46,218 --> 00:21:48,246
Okay.

522
00:21:48,427 --> 00:21:50,482
I know you want me to ask you

523
00:21:50,484 --> 00:21:52,083
why you are here, then.

524
00:21:52,085 --> 00:21:54,429
But I'm not going to.

525
00:21:55,181 --> 00:21:57,923
Jason is in your office, working.

526
00:21:57,925 --> 00:21:59,257
Uh-huh.

527
00:21:59,259 --> 00:22:01,261
Seems like a nice guy.

528
00:22:02,646 --> 00:22:03,807
Uh-huh.

529
00:22:04,348 --> 00:22:06,398
He reminds me of...

530
00:22:08,266 --> 00:22:09,935
Actually, he doesn't remind me of anyone.

531
00:22:10,904 --> 00:22:12,537
Very strong.

532
00:22:12,949 --> 00:22:14,839
Man of few words.

533
00:22:14,841 --> 00:22:17,275
Which is odd because most
of the people I deal with

534
00:22:17,277 --> 00:22:19,532
who you know... use a lot of words.

535
00:22:19,598 --> 00:22:20,772
Yes.

536
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:23,292
I've gotten over words.

537
00:22:23,529 --> 00:22:25,984
How'd you find Jason?

538
00:22:26,706 --> 00:22:29,107
- Eli, what?
- What?

539
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:32,357
What are you after?
What are you trying to say?

540
00:22:32,629 --> 00:22:36,528
I know your private life
is none of my business...

541
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:40,689
but when it begins to...
spill into your public life...

542
00:22:40,781 --> 00:22:42,067
You're telling me,

543
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:45,370
when I sleep with Jason you'd
rather I kept it private?

544
00:22:46,744 --> 00:22:47,430
(wry laugh)

545
00:22:47,457 --> 00:22:49,710
You're joking... right?

546
00:22:50,923 --> 00:22:52,611
You're making fun of me?

547
00:22:55,527 --> 00:22:58,788
Okay, I think you are making fun of me,
but I still need to be clear.

548
00:22:58,862 --> 00:23:00,452
(clears his throat)

549
00:23:00,666 --> 00:23:01,953
This is the speech I normally give

550
00:23:01,955 --> 00:23:04,089
to the candidate,
but I will adapt it for you.

551
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:05,902
- Lucky me.
- Rule number one...

552
00:23:05,994 --> 00:23:07,432
no touching in public.

553
00:23:07,527 --> 00:23:09,068
Ever.

554
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:12,181
If Jason is on fire, let him burn.

555
00:23:12,788 --> 00:23:14,332
Touching in private... No such thing.

556
00:23:14,334 --> 00:23:15,453
Nowhere is private anymore.

557
00:23:15,506 --> 00:23:16,284
Clearly.

558
00:23:16,337 --> 00:23:19,705
Rule number two...
if you have to go out together, make sure

559
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:22,133
there's always a third party present,
preferably female.

560
00:23:22,212 --> 00:23:25,610
Rule number three...
even if you go out in a bigger group,

561
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:29,681
never, under any circumstances,
let it be in a hotel, a bar...

562
00:23:31,685 --> 00:23:33,556
or a hotel bar.

563
00:23:34,717 --> 00:23:35,839
Eli...

564
00:23:36,182 --> 00:23:37,989
you didn't talk about any
of this with Jason, did you?

565
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:39,724
What?! No.

566
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,159
Okay.

567
00:23:41,947 --> 00:23:44,959
This is the first and last time

568
00:23:45,077 --> 00:23:46,793
we discuss this.

569
00:23:47,136 --> 00:23:51,331
I'm<i> not</i> sleeping with my investigator,
but if I were,

570
00:23:51,568 --> 00:23:54,272
this conversation between
us could never take place.

571
00:23:54,274 --> 00:23:57,242
I would never let it take place.

572
00:23:57,244 --> 00:24:00,616
- Please just tell me you heard me.
- No, Eli, I didn't hear you.

573
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,769
I won't hear you.
You can show yourself out.

574
00:24:13,068 --> 00:24:17,279
Alicia: I'm<i> not</i> sleeping with
my investigator, but if I were,

575
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:19,878
this conversation between
us could never take place.

576
00:24:19,997 --> 00:24:22,266
I would never let it take place.

577
00:24:22,372 --> 00:24:23,875
Eli: Please just tell me you heard me.

578
00:24:23,877 --> 00:24:25,624
Alicia: No, Eli, I didn't hear you.

579
00:24:25,677 --> 00:24:27,761
I won't hear you.

580
00:24:27,893 --> 00:24:29,614
You can show yourself out.

581
00:24:33,619 --> 00:24:36,878
Bad news... they got full discovery.

582
00:24:37,824 --> 00:24:39,385
Okay.

583
00:24:40,227 --> 00:24:41,456
New ball game.

584
00:24:41,495 --> 00:24:44,129
Yeah, a lot tougher one.
(outer door closes)

585
00:24:44,385 --> 00:24:45,664
You want a drink?

586
00:24:45,666 --> 00:24:47,445
I'm getting better at it.

587
00:24:47,894 --> 00:24:49,081
No.

588
00:24:50,004 --> 00:24:51,970
But thanks.

589
00:24:51,972 --> 00:24:53,165
Everything okay?

590
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:54,930
No.

591
00:24:56,414 --> 00:24:58,143
Full discovery.

592
00:24:58,145 --> 00:25:00,211
Oh, right.

593
00:25:00,213 --> 00:25:04,482
Well, maybe we're just on
the wrong side of this one.

594
00:25:04,484 --> 00:25:05,948
Maybe.

595
00:25:07,366 --> 00:25:09,054
I'll see you.

596
00:25:13,665 --> 00:25:15,927
Canning:
<i>The judge has granted full discovery.</i>

597
00:25:15,929 --> 00:25:18,777
Now, this complicates our job,
but it doesn't alter it.

598
00:25:18,827 --> 00:25:20,641
We still split up the materials.

599
00:25:20,723 --> 00:25:24,069
We still decide what is
responsive and what is not.

600
00:25:24,071 --> 00:25:26,533
Okay, so, go to it.

601
00:25:27,819 --> 00:25:29,880
- We have a problem.
- Already?

602
00:25:29,913 --> 00:25:32,618
An e-mail to Chumhum customer service.

603
00:25:32,684 --> 00:25:34,894
"Dear Chumhum, your search results suck.

604
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,514
"When I type in my name,

605
00:25:36,516 --> 00:25:38,383
"it auto-completes to some seriously

606
00:25:38,385 --> 00:25:39,884
racist crap."

607
00:25:39,886 --> 00:25:41,953
What seriously racist crap?

608
00:25:41,955 --> 00:25:44,689
When he typed in his name... Jamal...

609
00:25:44,691 --> 00:25:46,858
the auto-complete offered
to finish the sentence

610
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:49,394
with "Jamal stole my car," or

611
00:25:49,396 --> 00:25:52,397
- "Jamal arrest record."
- Okay, that's not good.

612
00:25:52,399 --> 00:25:54,399
- But it's non-responsive.
- Alicia: Really?

613
00:25:54,401 --> 00:25:56,267
- How do you figure?
- It's customer based. I mean,

614
00:25:56,269 --> 00:25:58,059
the auto-complete is based
on most used search requests,

615
00:25:58,158 --> 00:26:00,434
so, obviously,
more people who typed in "Jamal"

616
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:03,171
were interested in arrest
reports than anything else.

617
00:26:03,237 --> 00:26:06,074
So, Chumhum's not racist... its users are?

618
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:09,570
Well, one could argue
that it's racist to override the results.

619
00:26:09,619 --> 00:26:12,317
Okay, we need
to deal with the "animal" incident.

620
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:13,545
I don't like the sound of that.

621
00:26:13,578 --> 00:26:16,688
Chumhum has photo-identifying software.

622
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:18,459
It sorts your photos into categories.

623
00:26:18,525 --> 00:26:20,998
Camping trip, Disneyland, graduation.

624
00:26:21,081 --> 00:26:22,660
Lucca: One of the customers

625
00:26:22,662 --> 00:26:26,164
pointed out that it had
tagged photos of her friends.

626
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:31,269
Oh.

627
00:26:31,271 --> 00:26:33,853
Woman: <i>Alicia Florrick was</i>
was willing to forgive her husband

628
00:26:33,902 --> 00:26:35,255
when he stumbled.

629
00:26:35,321 --> 00:26:37,242
She deserves at least
that much understanding.

630
00:26:37,244 --> 00:26:38,643
And they put her on that election board,
right?

631
00:26:38,645 --> 00:26:40,895
They wouldn't have done that
if she hadn't turned herself around.

632
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,494
The election board, sure.

633
00:26:42,577 --> 00:26:46,156
Is there anything Mrs. Florrick has said

634
00:26:46,255 --> 00:26:50,355
or done that influences your view of her?

635
00:26:50,357 --> 00:26:52,557
Her episode of <i>Mama's Homespun Cooking.</i>

636
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:54,038
It was so... raw.

637
00:26:54,121 --> 00:26:56,644
Like she's a real person,
with crap to deal with.

638
00:26:56,759 --> 00:26:58,129
Oh, this is good.

639
00:26:58,131 --> 00:26:59,831
All right, well,
let's stay on that topic for a minute...

640
00:26:59,833 --> 00:27:01,399
- Yeah.
- Nora: Eli?

641
00:27:01,401 --> 00:27:03,101
I'll be right back.

642
00:27:03,103 --> 00:27:05,203
Real people who have to overcome
real issues in their life.

643
00:27:05,205 --> 00:27:07,105
Show of hands-
How many of you would value those qualities

644
00:27:07,107 --> 00:27:10,208
- in a political candidate?
- I have a mission for you.

645
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:12,577
A mission? Really?

646
00:27:12,579 --> 00:27:15,625
Sounds very... mission-like.

647
00:27:15,707 --> 00:27:18,249
Actually, it is.

648
00:27:18,653 --> 00:27:20,170
Mr. Agos?

649
00:27:20,236 --> 00:27:21,419
Cary's fine.

650
00:27:21,421 --> 00:27:23,755
Cary. I was checking up on the background

651
00:27:23,757 --> 00:27:26,024
of the coders over at the
Chicago Chumhum office.

652
00:27:26,026 --> 00:27:27,892
- Which coders?
- Kip O'Neill.

653
00:27:27,894 --> 00:27:29,561
The guy who created the Safe Filter.

654
00:27:29,563 --> 00:27:31,129
I went through his on-line postings.

655
00:27:31,131 --> 00:27:32,060
In 2013,

656
00:27:32,076 --> 00:27:34,432
a year before he created the filter,
he got mugged.

657
00:27:34,482 --> 00:27:37,599
He didn't say where, but he said
it was a "sketchy neighborhood."

658
00:27:37,681 --> 00:27:40,039
If he were mugged by...

659
00:27:40,699 --> 00:27:41,973
You can say it.

660
00:27:41,975 --> 00:27:43,675
If he were mugged by
African-American people,

661
00:27:43,677 --> 00:27:46,784
it's evidence he was racially motivated
in the creation of the filter.

662
00:27:46,817 --> 00:27:48,812
Good. Do we know if he was
mugged by African-Americans?

663
00:27:48,845 --> 00:27:51,251
No. I checked for news reports. Nothing.

664
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:54,085
Okay... That's good work, Brian.

665
00:27:56,824 --> 00:27:58,490
Whew!

666
00:27:58,492 --> 00:28:01,277
That is pretty good work by Biff,

667
00:28:01,656 --> 00:28:03,586
don't you think?

668
00:28:04,987 --> 00:28:06,498
Man: It's really not my team...

669
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,266
Imaging and tagging.

670
00:28:08,268 --> 00:28:10,001
I'll bring Josh over.

671
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,370
Where's Jason?
I thought he was meeting us here.

672
00:28:12,372 --> 00:28:13,972
Oh, yeah, he called.

673
00:28:13,974 --> 00:28:17,075
He thought you might want
to limit his hours on this?

674
00:28:17,555 --> 00:28:18,510
Kip: This is Josh.

675
00:28:18,512 --> 00:28:22,113
He can speak a little more
specifically as to, uh... yeah.

676
00:28:22,115 --> 00:28:25,316
Yeah.
So... the photo wasn't tagged by a person,

677
00:28:25,318 --> 00:28:27,118
it was tagged by an algorithm.

678
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,120
And the algorithm can't tell the difference

679
00:28:29,122 --> 00:28:31,840
between an African-American
woman and an animal?

680
00:28:31,939 --> 00:28:34,826
Well, it can now, but, uh,

681
00:28:34,828 --> 00:28:38,396
three years ago,
we hadn't given it enough examples.

682
00:28:38,398 --> 00:28:40,965
It had real trouble with light and shadow.

683
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,335
It got a lot of other stuff wrong, too.

684
00:28:44,337 --> 00:28:46,716
Just nothing else that looked so...

685
00:28:47,046 --> 00:28:49,541
- Racist?
- Right.

686
00:28:49,543 --> 00:28:51,647
It's gotten better.
Google had this problem, too.

687
00:28:51,729 --> 00:28:55,687
Alicia: Did the algorithm
ever mistake a white person for an animal?

688
00:28:56,033 --> 00:28:57,182
Why would it do that?

689
00:28:57,184 --> 00:29:01,085
Lucca: Because it mistakes white people for
polar bears or white seals.

690
00:29:01,087 --> 00:29:02,954
(laughs) No. Not so far.

691
00:29:02,956 --> 00:29:04,620
Why not?

692
00:29:05,177 --> 00:29:07,712
Why does it have trouble
identifying African-Americans,

693
00:29:07,815 --> 00:29:09,897
but not Caucasians?

694
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:13,608
I guess because we hadn't
given it enough examples.

695
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:14,799
We're not racists.

696
00:29:14,801 --> 00:29:16,201
I'm not saying you are.

697
00:29:16,203 --> 00:29:18,770
I'm just looking around your workplace.

698
00:29:21,121 --> 00:29:22,853
Alicia: <i>It's clearly responsive.</i>

699
00:29:22,915 --> 00:29:24,007
Canning: I disagree.

700
00:29:24,131 --> 00:29:26,007
It's not racist. It's a
technical shortcoming.

701
00:29:26,089 --> 00:29:27,612
It's implicit bias.

702
00:29:27,614 --> 00:29:29,547
Look, no one at Chumhum is actually racist.

703
00:29:29,549 --> 00:29:30,850
They just code what they know.

704
00:29:30,933 --> 00:29:33,947
That's why the tagging software
never misidentifies white people

705
00:29:33,957 --> 00:29:34,860
as animals.

706
00:29:34,953 --> 00:29:36,562
The software has been corrected.

707
00:29:36,628 --> 00:29:38,182
You yourself said no one
there is actually racist.

708
00:29:38,265 --> 00:29:40,625
This is non-responsive. Click it.

709
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:44,596
He's wrong.

710
00:29:45,395 --> 00:29:47,275
He's also paying our bills,

711
00:29:47,374 --> 00:29:49,106
so, I think we have to click it.

712
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:50,802
(door closes)

713
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,294
(doorbell rings)

714
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:57,542
Nora, hi. Eli's not here.

715
00:29:57,544 --> 00:29:59,687
I know. The campaign sent me.

716
00:29:59,818 --> 00:30:01,312
They sent you? Why?

717
00:30:01,632 --> 00:30:03,147
In case you need anything.

718
00:30:03,149 --> 00:30:04,983
Oh. Well, I don't. I'm fine.

719
00:30:04,985 --> 00:30:06,551
Oh, hey.

720
00:30:06,553 --> 00:30:08,353
- Back to the grindstone?
- Yeah.

721
00:30:08,355 --> 00:30:10,154
Tough boss.

722
00:30:11,131 --> 00:30:13,333
- Cary Agos called. He wants to meet.
- Why?

723
00:30:13,383 --> 00:30:14,900
I don't know.
Maybe he wants to make a deal.

724
00:30:14,982 --> 00:30:17,291
- Okay, give me second.
- No, he just asked for me.

725
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:18,896
I'll call you.

726
00:30:20,457 --> 00:30:21,842
(thud)

727
00:30:22,073 --> 00:30:25,338
I'll just wait in a corner,
in case you need anything.

728
00:30:25,404 --> 00:30:27,905
- Nora, I'm fine.
- It's okay.

729
00:30:28,241 --> 00:30:30,141
I have a book.

730
00:30:33,146 --> 00:30:34,845
Cary: Thanks for coming in, Lucca.

731
00:30:34,911 --> 00:30:36,972
Anything to settle this.

732
00:30:39,017 --> 00:30:41,286
We just found out one of your coders,
Kip O'Neill...

733
00:30:41,288 --> 00:30:43,388
He was mugged in 2013.

734
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:45,657
I wanted to see if you knew about this.

735
00:30:45,659 --> 00:30:48,010
This is why I'm here?

736
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,583
Yes.

737
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:57,902
He was mugged the year
before he created Safe Filter

738
00:30:57,904 --> 00:30:59,837
in what he called "a sketchy neighborhood."

739
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:01,500
Why call me?

740
00:31:01,582 --> 00:31:03,611
Why not Alicia?

741
00:31:04,567 --> 00:31:06,844
I thought you'd be more helpful.

742
00:31:11,394 --> 00:31:13,719
You're implying the assailants were black?

743
00:31:13,785 --> 00:31:16,087
(laughing): I'm not implying anything.

744
00:31:16,089 --> 00:31:17,991
I thought you could ask your client.

745
00:31:21,008 --> 00:31:22,393
Next time,

746
00:31:22,395 --> 00:31:24,339
call Alicia, too.

747
00:31:24,487 --> 00:31:26,497
It just seems like something
both our sides would need

748
00:31:26,499 --> 00:31:28,766
to address if it turns
out to be race-related.

749
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:30,325
Good-bye.

750
00:31:34,926 --> 00:31:37,041
It wasn't a negotiation.

751
00:31:37,043 --> 00:31:38,874
We might have a problem with Kip O'Neill.

752
00:31:38,907 --> 00:31:42,036
Okay, I got it. Jason's here.
I'll ask him.

753
00:31:42,894 --> 00:31:45,483
Kip O'Neill was mugged in 2013.

754
00:31:45,485 --> 00:31:47,185
It's on his profile page.

755
00:31:47,187 --> 00:31:49,147
We need to find out the
race of the culprits.

756
00:31:49,213 --> 00:31:51,143
All right. I'll see what I can do.

757
00:31:51,209 --> 00:31:55,002
Jason, did Eli talk to you

758
00:31:55,579 --> 00:31:57,462
before, when you were here?

759
00:31:58,696 --> 00:32:00,098
Yup.

760
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,680
About us?

761
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:03,768
What do you mean, "us?"

762
00:32:04,896 --> 00:32:07,071
Us working together.

763
00:32:08,237 --> 00:32:09,841
Yes.

764
00:32:12,376 --> 00:32:14,479
I don't want...

765
00:32:14,481 --> 00:32:17,882
things to be uncomfortable between us.

766
00:32:17,884 --> 00:32:19,751
- Me, neither.
- Well, then, don't let Eli

767
00:32:19,753 --> 00:32:21,726
make them uncomfortable.

768
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,530
Here's the thing.

769
00:32:30,997 --> 00:32:35,021
I used to have a very different life.

770
00:32:35,466 --> 00:32:37,198
A very...

771
00:32:39,105 --> 00:32:41,506
uncomfortable life.

772
00:32:41,809 --> 00:32:44,308
I didn't like it.

773
00:32:44,613 --> 00:32:48,579
So now, there is nothing I do

774
00:32:49,824 --> 00:32:52,232
that makes me uncomfortable.

775
00:32:52,693 --> 00:32:54,152
Nothing.

776
00:32:54,738 --> 00:32:56,262
Even if I want something...

777
00:32:56,279 --> 00:32:57,334
(door opens)

778
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,818
Is everything all right in here?

779
00:32:58,868 --> 00:33:01,859
- Do you need anything?
- We're fine, Nora. Thank you.

780
00:33:05,565 --> 00:33:06,536
(door shuts)

781
00:33:06,618 --> 00:33:08,086
You said, "even if you want something..."?

782
00:33:08,138 --> 00:33:10,067
Yeah, you know, that's...

783
00:33:10,286 --> 00:33:13,137
- It's okay.
- Jason...

784
00:33:13,139 --> 00:33:15,540
look, I just, I like things simple.

785
00:33:15,542 --> 00:33:18,576
All right?
Work simple, home simple, life simple.

786
00:33:18,578 --> 00:33:20,020
And isn't it?

787
00:33:20,119 --> 00:33:21,619
It was.

788
00:33:27,523 --> 00:33:29,287
I have to get back to work.

789
00:33:29,502 --> 00:33:31,008
I'll call you.

790
00:33:34,932 --> 00:33:36,615
(sighs intensely)

791
00:33:41,658 --> 00:33:43,986
How did we go from mugging
victim to possible racist?

792
00:33:44,035 --> 00:33:47,004
If the guys who mugged
him were black or Latino,

793
00:33:47,037 --> 00:33:51,267
Cary and Diana will say racial bias
was motivation for the Safe Filter.

794
00:33:51,415 --> 00:33:53,493
- So cynical.
- Here he is.

795
00:33:53,592 --> 00:33:55,373
- Canning: So?
- Good news.

796
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:57,937
The attackers were white,
one was a redhead,

797
00:33:57,939 --> 00:34:01,178
so as long as that hasn't been
categorized as a new race...

798
00:34:01,244 --> 00:34:02,809
We dodged a bullet.

799
00:34:02,811 --> 00:34:05,878
Jason: What do you get
when you cross a black and two Mexicans?

800
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,980
- Excuse me?
- It's a joke.

801
00:34:07,982 --> 00:34:09,415
Kip e-mailed it to his teammates

802
00:34:09,417 --> 00:34:11,451
four weeks before they
launched Chummy Maps.

803
00:34:11,453 --> 00:34:13,686
Which I'm guessing gives Diana

804
00:34:13,688 --> 00:34:15,181
and Cary their bias.

805
00:34:15,231 --> 00:34:16,956
- Damn.
- Kip: <i>I'm not a racist.</i>

806
00:34:16,958 --> 00:34:18,191
And I'm sure some

807
00:34:18,193 --> 00:34:19,871
of your best friends
are blacks and Mexicans.

808
00:34:19,921 --> 00:34:21,801
The joke was just me
breaking up the drudge work.

809
00:34:21,867 --> 00:34:23,714
Apparently,
work around here gets pretty drudgy.

810
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:25,798
There are<i> dozens</i> of these jokes here.

811
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,633
Then you've seen the white jokes, too.

812
00:34:27,635 --> 00:34:29,402
That... really doesn't help, Kip.

813
00:34:29,404 --> 00:34:32,355
Look... we work a hundred hours a week.

814
00:34:32,437 --> 00:34:34,407
We sleep on the floor here half the nights.

815
00:34:34,409 --> 00:34:37,443
It was a meta joke... A joke about joking.

816
00:34:37,445 --> 00:34:39,590
Like dead baby jokes.

817
00:34:39,854 --> 00:34:41,347
Canning: <i>So they were just a bunch</i>

818
00:34:41,349 --> 00:34:43,783
- of immature frat boys blowing off steam.
- Pretty much.

819
00:34:43,785 --> 00:34:48,330
But it's gonna be hard denying any
knowledge of racism to Judge Marx.

820
00:34:48,825 --> 00:34:50,223
You're right.

821
00:34:51,002 --> 00:34:52,931
Y... You're finally agreeing with me.

822
00:34:53,014 --> 00:34:54,660
It's been known to happen, Alicia.

823
00:34:54,662 --> 00:34:55,390
(sighs): Okay...

824
00:34:55,456 --> 00:34:59,198
then I will tag every Chumhum e-mail
with racist jokes "responsive."

825
00:34:59,481 --> 00:35:01,117
Not just e-mail.

826
00:35:01,196 --> 00:35:03,504
Tag every racist joke on the Internet.

827
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:06,439
I'm sure a Chumhum search will
turn up a billion Web pages.

828
00:35:06,441 --> 00:35:08,508
Just mark all "responsive."

829
00:35:09,157 --> 00:35:10,886
- You're gonna bury the e-mails.
- Of course not.

830
00:35:10,965 --> 00:35:13,312
I'm just following the judge's directives.

831
00:35:13,867 --> 00:35:17,850
- Diana:<i> This</i> is their discovery?
- 50-terabyte hard drive.

832
00:35:18,027 --> 00:35:20,570
Picture all the contents
in the Library of Congress,

833
00:35:20,623 --> 00:35:22,922
and then multiply that by five.

834
00:35:23,772 --> 00:35:26,847
Congratulations... We've just been hit
with what may be the largest document dump

835
00:35:26,911 --> 00:35:29,529
in American legal history.

836
00:35:33,234 --> 00:35:35,101
- Go away.
- What are you doing here?

837
00:35:35,103 --> 00:35:36,588
- You're supposed to be with Alicia!
- No,

838
00:35:36,654 --> 00:35:38,386
- I'm<i> supposed</i> to be working.
- That<i> was</i> work.

839
00:35:38,452 --> 00:35:42,063
No, that was the most
embarrassing thing I've ever done, Eli.

840
00:35:42,064 --> 00:35:44,844
- And I've done your laundry.
- Where are they now?

841
00:35:44,846 --> 00:35:46,445
Eli, they're not shtupping at 11:00

842
00:35:46,447 --> 00:35:47,604
- in the morning.
- Shh!

843
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:49,979
Courtney can't know.

844
00:35:50,111 --> 00:35:52,385
You are a horrible employee.

845
00:35:52,387 --> 00:35:53,819
(quietly): And you're a monster.

846
00:35:53,821 --> 00:35:55,321
Yeah, uh... okay, yes,

847
00:35:55,323 --> 00:35:57,323
- I'll-I'll see what I can do.
- Thank you so much.

848
00:35:57,325 --> 00:35:59,225
Mm-hmm.

849
00:35:59,973 --> 00:36:02,298
- Everything all right?
- Yes.

850
00:36:02,364 --> 00:36:03,863
Can I call you later?

851
00:36:03,865 --> 00:36:05,827
About the PAC?

852
00:36:06,421 --> 00:36:07,867
About the PAC.

853
00:36:13,033 --> 00:36:15,875
- Ruth: Eli.
- You rang?

854
00:36:16,545 --> 00:36:17,710
What's this?

855
00:36:17,712 --> 00:36:19,745
A file on Jason.

856
00:36:19,747 --> 00:36:21,681
Skeletons and such.

857
00:36:21,683 --> 00:36:23,616
- Show it to Alicia.
- No.

858
00:36:23,618 --> 00:36:26,552
- It won't work.
- You haven't read it.

859
00:36:26,554 --> 00:36:27,954
Alicia doesn't scare.

860
00:36:27,956 --> 00:36:29,889
Not when it comes to men.

861
00:36:30,758 --> 00:36:33,125
All women scare.

862
00:36:34,128 --> 00:36:35,883
Use it.

863
00:36:40,005 --> 00:36:41,834
Here he is again.

864
00:36:41,836 --> 00:36:43,502
What'd you find, Brian?

865
00:36:43,504 --> 00:36:45,037
I've been going through the algorithms.

866
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:47,073
I thought you were digging
through the discovery.

867
00:36:47,075 --> 00:36:49,141
Sometimes it's best to look in the math.

868
00:36:49,143 --> 00:36:50,209
What'd you find?

869
00:36:50,211 --> 00:36:52,511
A patch... pretty crude, hastily done.

870
00:36:52,513 --> 00:36:53,434
I don't know what that means.

871
00:36:53,467 --> 00:36:55,281
It's embedded in the photo-tagging software

872
00:36:55,347 --> 00:36:58,596
It was altered so the word "animal"
could never appear in a photo tag.

873
00:36:58,649 --> 00:37:00,324
Why would they do that?

874
00:37:00,601 --> 00:37:02,288
To hide something?

875
00:37:06,761 --> 00:37:08,828
Plaintiff has a motion to compel?

876
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:10,659
Diana: We do.

877
00:37:11,616 --> 00:37:15,672
This, uh,
photo shows an African-American woman

878
00:37:15,738 --> 00:37:19,333
who was mistaken by Chumhum's
photo-tagging software

879
00:37:19,399 --> 00:37:21,774
and tagged as an "animal."

880
00:37:21,776 --> 00:37:23,309
Yes, it does.

881
00:37:23,311 --> 00:37:26,290
We discovered this photo
when we noticed a patch

882
00:37:26,356 --> 00:37:28,381
in Chumhum's photo-tagging algorithm.

883
00:37:28,383 --> 00:37:30,549
A patch in the software?

884
00:37:30,551 --> 00:37:33,152
- So it wouldn't happen again?
- Yes, but rather than...

885
00:37:33,154 --> 00:37:34,820
fix the underlying problem,

886
00:37:34,822 --> 00:37:38,440
they simply...
patched it to prevent one instance

887
00:37:38,539 --> 00:37:40,726
of the problem from recurring.
Was this included

888
00:37:40,728 --> 00:37:42,728
- in discovery?
- We don't know, Your Honor.

889
00:37:42,794 --> 00:37:45,998
Chumhum's counsel sent us 50 terabytes

890
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
of discovery... It will take my firm

891
00:37:48,002 --> 00:37:49,621
six years to work through it.

892
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:51,121
I see.

893
00:37:51,204 --> 00:37:53,133
Mrs. Florrick...

894
00:37:54,613 --> 00:37:57,309
did you include this photo in discovery?

895
00:37:58,735 --> 00:37:59,609
No, Your Honor.

896
00:37:59,675 --> 00:38:01,714
Were you aware of the photo?

897
00:38:02,984 --> 00:38:06,057
We were, Your Honor,
but we found it nonresponsive.

898
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:07,624
Really? So you found

899
00:38:07,673 --> 00:38:10,328
50 terabytes of data responsive...

900
00:38:10,493 --> 00:38:13,259
but an African-American woman
being mistaken for an animal

901
00:38:13,261 --> 00:38:14,827
didn't make the cut?

902
00:38:14,829 --> 00:38:16,547
- We believed it did not.
- No, you will provide

903
00:38:16,563 --> 00:38:19,565
all responsive documents to
plaintiff's attorneys today,

904
00:38:19,567 --> 00:38:21,692
<i>and</i> you have been found in contempt, ma'am.

905
00:38:21,758 --> 00:38:24,808
- Your Honor, this was not my...
- You will pay $5,000

906
00:38:24,841 --> 00:38:26,972
to the Clerk of the Circuit Court

907
00:38:26,974 --> 00:38:28,669
by end of day Friday,

908
00:38:28,735 --> 00:38:31,043
as well as any plaintiff's
costs and attorney's fees

909
00:38:31,045 --> 00:38:34,647
incurred in pursuing this violation.

910
00:38:34,649 --> 00:38:37,195
And if there are any more games like this,

911
00:38:37,244 --> 00:38:39,965
the sanctions will be doubled.
You understand?

912
00:38:40,031 --> 00:38:41,554
I do, Your Honor.

913
00:38:41,556 --> 00:38:43,222
(gavel bangs)

914
00:38:51,606 --> 00:38:52,898
(sighs): All right, look...

915
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:55,317
you have any more questions,
you ask Alicia, all right?

916
00:38:55,399 --> 00:38:58,153
- I'm a guest here.
- I don't have a question.

917
00:38:58,236 --> 00:38:59,728
Good.

918
00:39:00,308 --> 00:39:02,041
What's that?

919
00:39:02,043 --> 00:39:04,810
A file on you, from the campaign.

920
00:39:05,945 --> 00:39:06,901
You serious?

921
00:39:06,951 --> 00:39:08,518
I'm not, but the campaign is.

922
00:39:08,584 --> 00:39:10,299
She knows all about my criminal record.

923
00:39:10,365 --> 00:39:13,185
I don't pretend like it doesn't exist.

924
00:39:13,187 --> 00:39:15,988
Take a look at the back page.

925
00:39:17,526 --> 00:39:19,950
Does she know about that?

926
00:39:20,544 --> 00:39:23,395
Why are you investigating Alicia?

927
00:39:24,057 --> 00:39:27,651
- It's none of your business.
- Actually, that part is.

928
00:39:29,255 --> 00:39:31,203
I was going into business with her.

929
00:39:31,205 --> 00:39:35,141
I wanted to know more about
my prospective employer.

930
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:37,430
I don't believe you.

931
00:39:37,483 --> 00:39:39,845
And I seriously don't give a damn.

932
00:39:40,042 --> 00:39:41,714
This stuff...

933
00:39:41,716 --> 00:39:44,686
this is<i> your</i> life, it's not mine.

934
00:39:45,082 --> 00:39:46,601
Eli...

935
00:39:48,122 --> 00:39:50,652
do not make it mine.

936
00:39:55,546 --> 00:39:57,596
Now, get off my car.

937
00:39:59,003 --> 00:40:01,934
(car door opens, shuts;
siren wails in distance)

938
00:40:07,123 --> 00:40:11,266
- Okay, we're listening.
- One. Effective 9:00 a.m. this morning,

939
00:40:11,293 --> 00:40:14,185
Josh Shelby's employment
at Chumhum was terminated.

940
00:40:14,295 --> 00:40:16,441
- The Photo Coder?
- Yes. Two.

941
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:18,697
The Safe Filter has been
changed from a default setting

942
00:40:18,699 --> 00:40:21,166
to an opt-in...
Users will have to activate it

943
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:23,001
if they want to know areas to avoid.

944
00:40:23,003 --> 00:40:25,702
And the business icons
should not be switched off.

945
00:40:25,821 --> 00:40:27,239
- We agree.
- Cary: Fine.

946
00:40:27,241 --> 00:40:28,609
And how much you offer?

947
00:40:28,688 --> 00:40:29,981
Zero.

948
00:40:31,327 --> 00:40:34,079
We were under the impression
this was a settlement offer.

949
00:40:34,081 --> 00:40:36,648
These are Little Dokebi's
financial records.

950
00:40:36,650 --> 00:40:37,950
The restaurant was struggling.

951
00:40:37,952 --> 00:40:40,197
Ms. Feldman was slashing costs

952
00:40:40,249 --> 00:40:42,221
almost as much as 35%

953
00:40:42,223 --> 00:40:43,983
because business was going soft.

954
00:40:44,062 --> 00:40:46,158
She started doing this two months...

955
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:49,036
<i>before</i> the Safe Filter went live.

956
00:40:49,537 --> 00:40:51,503
Restaurant business 101, Ms. Feldman...

957
00:40:51,555 --> 00:40:53,787
Your business tanked because you
skimped on quality.

958
00:40:53,827 --> 00:40:54,328
Mr. Canning...

959
00:40:54,402 --> 00:40:56,602
- That's not true.
- How did you even get these documents?

960
00:40:56,604 --> 00:40:59,705
Ms. Feldman stored them on Chumhum's
cloud-based spreadsheet service.

961
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:01,206
- Which is private...
- Actually,

962
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:02,908
users authorize Chumhum total access

963
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:04,910
when they agree to the terms of service.

964
00:41:04,912 --> 00:41:06,645
It was a free service.

965
00:41:06,647 --> 00:41:08,827
Divya probably wanted to save some money.

966
00:41:08,893 --> 00:41:09,605
Mr. Canning...

967
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:11,817
(others arguing)
I have never skimped in my life.

968
00:41:11,819 --> 00:41:15,254
(all talking at once)

969
00:41:16,584 --> 00:41:19,525
Sorry, but I'm not sure what we can do.

970
00:41:19,790 --> 00:41:23,028
So your client isn't racist...
they're just omnipotent.

971
00:41:23,246 --> 00:41:25,431
Keeping us all safe.

972
00:41:26,767 --> 00:41:28,827
You want to celebrate?

973
00:41:29,486 --> 00:41:31,136
In what manner?

974
00:41:31,138 --> 00:41:33,839
In any manner you desire.

975
00:41:35,976 --> 00:41:38,510
(dance music blaring)

976
00:41:47,087 --> 00:41:49,321
So, is this your place?

977
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:52,991
Let's go dance.

978
00:41:52,993 --> 00:41:55,527
I don't... I don't really dance.

979
00:41:59,608 --> 00:42:01,270
Too bad.

980
00:42:04,672 --> 00:42:05,871
Whoo!

981
00:42:15,888 --> 00:42:17,326
Screw it.

982
00:42:27,473 --> 00:42:29,162
- I'm sorry to bother you so late.
- No.

983
00:42:29,214 --> 00:42:30,903
- We need to talk about Jason.
- No, we don't.

984
00:42:30,969 --> 00:42:33,067
He has a file on you.

985
00:42:33,792 --> 00:42:36,629
- What does that mean?
- He has a personal file on you.

986
00:42:36,721 --> 00:42:39,202
He has looked into your past.

Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
