_

4
00:00:17,481 --> 00:00:18,668
<i>God, I thought it was you.</i>

5
00:00:18,669 --> 00:00:21,471
I heard "Grace"
and I was like, "Oh, God."

6
00:00:21,722 --> 00:00:23,356
Did you know her?

7
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:26,625
No. I-I mean, a little.

8
00:00:26,626 --> 00:00:28,527
What happened?

9
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:31,597
Portia said she took a handful
of her mom's sleeping pills.

10
00:00:31,598 --> 00:00:32,831
No, she did it at the hotel

11
00:00:32,832 --> 00:00:34,366
where she was supposed
to go for the prom.

12
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:35,901
- Why?
- I think her boyfriend

13
00:00:35,902 --> 00:00:37,135
broke up with her
or something.

14
00:00:37,136 --> 00:00:38,236
They said she was
in her underwear.

15
00:00:38,237 --> 00:00:39,337
<i>Hannah just tweeted</i>

16
00:00:39,338 --> 00:00:40,938
it was aspirin, not painkillers.

17
00:00:40,939 --> 00:00:42,840
Did you guys see Connor just

18
00:00:42,841 --> 00:00:45,877
checked in on Foursquare, like,
an hour ago? At the library.

19
00:00:45,878 --> 00:00:47,244
What are you doing
at the library

20
00:00:47,245 --> 00:00:48,613
the day after your girlfriend
kills herself?

21
00:00:48,614 --> 00:00:50,481
Ex-girlfriend.
They broke up last week.

22
00:00:50,482 --> 00:00:52,149
- Did you see he changed his
status to "Single"?   - I know.

23
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:54,151
She tweeted a picture
of herself last week

24
00:00:54,152 --> 00:00:55,753
after she dyed her hair red...
#YOLO.

25
00:00:55,754 --> 00:00:57,220
Yeah, "You only live once."

26
00:00:57,221 --> 00:00:59,355
She sat two rows behind
me in algebra last year.

27
00:00:59,356 --> 00:01:00,757
I know it's kind of morbid,

28
00:01:00,758 --> 00:01:02,258
but I can't stop looking
at her Facebook page.

29
00:01:05,663 --> 00:01:07,363
And who is this?

30
00:01:07,364 --> 00:01:08,798
Mr. Van Zanten.

31
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,233
And you shot him
four times in the head?

32
00:01:10,234 --> 00:01:11,167
Yes.

33
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:12,868
Why would you do that,
Mr. Yates?

34
00:01:13,369 --> 00:01:14,837
Because she wanted me to.

35
00:01:14,838 --> 00:01:16,505
You're referring
to the accused,

36
00:01:16,506 --> 00:01:18,306
- Gwyneth Van Zanten?
- Yes.

37
00:01:18,307 --> 00:01:20,275
- You were her Pilates instructor?
- Yes, but she said

38
00:01:20,276 --> 00:01:22,177
she loved me.
If I shot her husband...

39
00:01:22,178 --> 00:01:23,679
we would be together.

40
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,346
With his money?

41
00:01:24,347 --> 00:01:25,480
Objection. Leading.

42
00:01:27,183 --> 00:01:28,383
Sustained.

43
00:01:28,384 --> 00:01:30,251
And you...

44
00:01:30,252 --> 00:01:31,686
Strike that.

45
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,195
Why did M-Mrs. Van Zanten
want you to shoot her husband?

46
00:01:41,196 --> 00:01:42,263
Objection.

47
00:01:42,264 --> 00:01:43,598
Ambiguous.

48
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:46,167
Unfortunately, sustained.

49
00:01:51,106 --> 00:01:53,307
O-One second.

50
00:01:54,209 --> 00:01:56,277
Oh, did the
accused offer you

51
00:01:56,278 --> 00:01:58,512
anything in exchange
for this murder?

52
00:01:58,513 --> 00:02:00,814
Yes, she said
we'd split his money.

53
00:02:00,815 --> 00:02:01,847
And did Mrs. Van Zanten explain

54
00:02:01,848 --> 00:02:03,383
why she wanted
her husband killed?

55
00:02:03,384 --> 00:02:05,185
He's a rich CEO.
They had a prenup.

56
00:02:05,186 --> 00:02:06,586
If she divorced him,
she got nothing.

57
00:02:06,587 --> 00:02:07,587
But if he died,

58
00:02:07,588 --> 00:02:08,988
she got everything.

59
00:02:08,989 --> 00:02:10,690
I see. And what happened

60
00:02:10,691 --> 00:02:11,991
- after the murder?
- Objection.

61
00:02:11,992 --> 00:02:13,293
Calls for narrative.

62
00:02:13,294 --> 00:02:14,427
Ms. Hellinger,

63
00:02:14,428 --> 00:02:17,129
you are now experiencing
ASA Hazing 101.

64
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:18,497
Sustained.

65
00:02:18,498 --> 00:02:20,532
Thank you, Your Honor.

66
00:02:21,434 --> 00:02:23,668
Did you text the accused
after the murder?

67
00:02:23,669 --> 00:02:25,704
- I did.
- And what did your text say?

68
00:02:25,705 --> 00:02:27,206
"It's done.

69
00:02:27,207 --> 00:02:29,674
"Our problems are over.

70
00:02:30,175 --> 00:02:31,643
Don't go home until 8:00."

71
00:02:31,644 --> 00:02:32,944
Why not go home until 8:00?

72
00:02:32,945 --> 00:02:35,179
To establish her alibi.

73
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,215
Hello, this is the principal
at Capstone Preparatory.

74
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:39,450
Over the weekend,
there was a tragic incident

75
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:40,784
involving a Capstone student.

76
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:42,353
Please take a moment
to discuss this...

77
00:02:44,389 --> 00:02:46,024
Hey.

78
00:02:46,025 --> 00:02:47,258
Hi.

79
00:02:47,259 --> 00:02:48,860
A bit more rough and tumble
than military court.

80
00:02:48,861 --> 00:02:50,861
You'll be fine.
Just don't retreat.

81
00:02:50,862 --> 00:02:52,562
You're either advancing
or retreating.

82
00:02:52,563 --> 00:02:53,897
- Hi, Mom.
- My daughter.

83
00:02:53,898 --> 00:02:55,398
No, thanks.

84
00:02:55,399 --> 00:02:56,566
Grace.

85
00:02:56,567 --> 00:02:58,301
Uh, hi. What's going on?

86
00:02:58,302 --> 00:03:00,403
- I just got a call from school.
- Oh, yeah.

87
00:03:00,404 --> 00:03:02,640
Grace Baskin OD'd on pills.

88
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:04,374
Oh, my God. When?

89
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:05,542
Last night.

90
00:03:05,543 --> 00:03:07,110
We're all wearing yellow today.

91
00:03:07,111 --> 00:03:08,778
It was her favorite color.

92
00:03:08,779 --> 00:03:09,979
What happened?

93
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,380
Hey, Mom, I have
to get to class.

94
00:03:11,381 --> 00:03:13,149
- Can I call you back?
- Are you all right?

95
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:15,417
Yeah, I mean, it's sad,
but I'm good.

96
00:03:15,418 --> 00:03:17,154
I'll call you back, okay?

97
00:03:17,855 --> 00:03:19,689
It's his fault.

98
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:21,490
I didn't even think
he'd show up at school.

99
00:03:21,491 --> 00:03:22,924
- And, look, he didn't wear yellow.
- I heard

100
00:03:22,925 --> 00:03:24,192
he told her to
get an abortion.

101
00:03:24,193 --> 00:03:25,160
No, he didn't.

102
00:03:25,161 --> 00:03:26,327
She wasn't
even pregnant.

103
00:03:26,328 --> 00:03:27,996
Yeah, who told you
she got an abortion?

104
00:03:27,997 --> 00:03:29,564
I don't know. Someone
re-tweeted it.

105
00:03:29,565 --> 00:03:30,732
Is that even his car?

106
00:03:30,733 --> 00:03:32,300
- I thought he was a scholarship kid.
- He is.

107
00:03:32,301 --> 00:03:33,869
I've seen him
on the bus.

108
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:35,671
Do you think
he blames himself?

109
00:03:35,672 --> 00:03:37,872
Wouldn't you?
He breaks up with her,

110
00:03:37,873 --> 00:03:39,406
then four days later,
she kills herself.

111
00:03:39,407 --> 00:03:41,175
I know.

112
00:03:41,176 --> 00:03:43,210
Can you imagine?

113
00:03:43,211 --> 00:03:45,746
My client has stated that she
was faithful to her late husband

114
00:03:45,747 --> 00:03:47,247
and that they were
happily married.

115
00:03:47,248 --> 00:03:49,216
Yet you claim she was having
an affair with you?

116
00:03:49,217 --> 00:03:51,552
- Yes.
- Do you have any proof of this?

117
00:03:51,553 --> 00:03:53,120
Any love letters? Any...

118
00:03:53,121 --> 00:03:55,488
mementos of this...

119
00:03:55,489 --> 00:03:56,990
torrid affair?

120
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:58,825
- No.
- I see.

121
00:03:58,826 --> 00:04:01,094
So we're to take
your word for it?

122
00:04:01,095 --> 00:04:04,230
And this text you sent her...
that it was "done"...

123
00:04:04,231 --> 00:04:05,331
what did she write back?

124
00:04:05,332 --> 00:04:07,667
She didn't.
We talked in person.

125
00:04:07,668 --> 00:04:09,235
Ah. So...

126
00:04:09,236 --> 00:04:10,569
you admitted
killing her husband,

127
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:13,672
you admitted sending her a
text admitting your guilt,

128
00:04:13,673 --> 00:04:15,540
and my client hasn't
admitted a thing?

129
00:04:16,642 --> 00:04:19,277
Objection, Your Honor,
counsel is testifying.

130
00:04:19,278 --> 00:04:20,813
Yes, he is that.

131
00:04:20,814 --> 00:04:22,547
Sustained.

132
00:04:23,382 --> 00:04:25,150
After you sent this text,

133
00:04:25,151 --> 00:04:26,984
my client immediately
informed the police,

134
00:04:26,985 --> 00:04:27,985
- didn't she?
- Objection,

135
00:04:27,986 --> 00:04:29,520
Your Honor.
Counsel is still

136
00:04:29,521 --> 00:04:30,955
testifying.
Not only that,

137
00:04:30,956 --> 00:04:32,990
he's asking
for hearsay.

138
00:04:32,991 --> 00:04:35,059
It goes to the defendant's
state of mind, Your Honor.

139
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,728
Actually, no.
Mr. Gardner is asking

140
00:04:36,729 --> 00:04:38,229
for the content
of a conversation

141
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:40,932
between Mrs. Van Zanten
and a police detective.

142
00:04:40,933 --> 00:04:41,865
If that's what he wants,

143
00:04:41,866 --> 00:04:43,266
he should put one of them
on the stand.

144
00:04:43,267 --> 00:04:44,868
Oh, she's got you
there, Mr. Gardner.

145
00:04:44,869 --> 00:04:46,536
Congratulations, Ms. Hellinger.

146
00:04:47,571 --> 00:04:49,773
Hmm.

147
00:04:56,313 --> 00:04:57,680
What were you offered in trade

148
00:04:57,681 --> 00:04:59,448
for your testimony here,
Mr. Yates?

149
00:04:59,449 --> 00:05:01,450
Well, I wouldn't say
it was a trade.

150
00:05:01,951 --> 00:05:03,619
I received a plea bargain.

151
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:04,620
And what was the plea bargain?

152
00:05:04,621 --> 00:05:05,955
20 years.

153
00:05:05,956 --> 00:05:06,989
For cold-blooded murder?

154
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:08,557
Objection, Your Honor.
Argumentative.

155
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:10,192
Yes. Sustained.

156
00:05:11,427 --> 00:05:13,328
And what is the usual sentence

157
00:05:13,329 --> 00:05:15,096
- for first-degree murder?
- Objection, Your Honor.

158
00:05:15,097 --> 00:05:16,264
Calls for speculation.

159
00:05:16,265 --> 00:05:17,966
Yes. Sustained.

160
00:05:20,002 --> 00:05:23,938
- A murder like this usually draws
a 45-year sentence... - Objection.

161
00:05:23,939 --> 00:05:25,840
Counsel is testifying.

162
00:05:25,841 --> 00:05:27,208
Sustained again.

163
00:05:27,209 --> 00:05:29,510
Are you having trouble getting
out what you want, Mr. Gardner?

164
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:38,185
Nicely played.

165
00:05:38,186 --> 00:05:39,519
Thank you.

166
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,720
We used to represent you.

167
00:05:40,721 --> 00:05:42,122
Yep.

168
00:05:42,123 --> 00:05:44,324
Thank you.

169
00:05:50,831 --> 00:05:52,364
Go well in court?

170
00:05:52,365 --> 00:05:55,367
Everybody feels bad
for the underdog.

171
00:05:55,868 --> 00:05:58,037
What about the person
who's supposed to do well?

172
00:05:58,038 --> 00:06:00,807
No one talks about the
pressure we're under.

173
00:06:03,543 --> 00:06:05,511
So, what's
up with you?

174
00:06:05,512 --> 00:06:08,380
- You've been away from work.
-  No.

175
00:06:08,881 --> 00:06:10,816
Mentally, you have.
What's going on?

176
00:06:10,817 --> 00:06:13,485
Oh, just, uh,
personal stuff.

177
00:06:13,486 --> 00:06:15,255
Uninteresting.

178
00:06:16,756 --> 00:06:18,956
Huh. Judge Creary.

179
00:06:20,426 --> 00:06:21,992
What are you doing?

180
00:06:21,993 --> 00:06:23,628
Going to the restroom.

181
00:06:23,629 --> 00:06:25,930
Look, Creary plays by the book.

182
00:06:25,931 --> 00:06:27,097
Then he doesn't
have to talk.

183
00:06:27,098 --> 00:06:28,098
Kalinda, this
single case

184
00:06:28,099 --> 00:06:29,367
could drag us
out of bankruptcy.

185
00:06:29,368 --> 00:06:31,703
I want to get a sense
of where we stand.

186
00:06:37,642 --> 00:06:40,677
Oh, Will Gardner!
How the hell are you?

187
00:06:40,678 --> 00:06:42,011
Judge Creary.

188
00:06:42,012 --> 00:06:44,147
No, uh, no, I'll
call you right back.

189
00:06:45,717 --> 00:06:47,584
Will, hello.

190
00:06:47,585 --> 00:06:50,320
Giada, I... I didn't
know you were in town.

191
00:06:50,321 --> 00:06:51,754
Yeah, Orren & Polk,
second year.

192
00:06:51,755 --> 00:06:54,357
His Honor was just offering
me some career advice.

193
00:06:54,358 --> 00:06:57,125
- Do you know this bastard?
- I do. We met when I was

194
00:06:57,126 --> 00:06:58,327
at DePaul, although
we haven't spoken

195
00:06:58,328 --> 00:06:59,962
in a while.
What happened there?

196
00:06:59,963 --> 00:07:02,598
- I don't know, I thought it was you.
- Oh, no, it wasn't me.

197
00:07:02,599 --> 00:07:03,733
Yeah, well,
I'd stay away from him.

198
00:07:03,734 --> 00:07:05,200
- He's a bad influence.
- Oh, I knew that.

199
00:07:05,201 --> 00:07:07,802
- Will is a bad boy.
- Disbarred bad boy.

200
00:07:07,803 --> 00:07:09,270
Six-months-
suspended bad boy.

201
00:07:09,271 --> 00:07:11,005
You should've seen him
in court today.

202
00:07:11,006 --> 00:07:13,842
He was completely screwed up.

203
00:07:13,843 --> 00:07:17,144
Really? I... thought we
more than held our own.

204
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:20,214
Mm-mm. No, you're gone,
you're-you're cooked,

205
00:07:20,215 --> 00:07:22,449
you're... deep-fried cooked.

206
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:24,852
- Why is that?
- Your client... she's guilty.

207
00:07:24,853 --> 00:07:26,052
How do you figure,
Your Honor?

208
00:07:26,053 --> 00:07:27,254
<i>Actus reus.</i>

209
00:07:27,255 --> 00:07:29,690
You're trying to make
her out to be a saint.

210
00:07:29,691 --> 00:07:31,958
- She was cheating on her husband.
- No, I'm sorry,

211
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:34,694
- Your Honor, that's just not true.
- I can't for the life of me

212
00:07:34,695 --> 00:07:36,863
figure why you
wanted a bench trial.

213
00:07:36,864 --> 00:07:40,000
Except you'd probably
do worse with a jury.

214
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:41,968
His client is an ice queen.

215
00:07:41,969 --> 00:07:43,503
Looks something like this.

216
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:45,805
- I mean it.
- Your Honor, if you believe that,

217
00:07:45,806 --> 00:07:47,039
- you need to recuse yourself.
- Ooh!

218
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,508
I love this one!
With his ethics!

219
00:07:49,509 --> 00:07:52,177
Love the ethics, Will.

220
00:07:52,178 --> 00:07:54,280
Great for a disbarred lawyer.

221
00:07:54,281 --> 00:07:55,780
Mm.

222
00:07:55,781 --> 00:07:57,883
Bribing judges and stealing.

223
00:07:57,884 --> 00:07:59,919
You know, if it was up to me,

224
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,821
you wouldn't be allowed
to practice law ever again.

225
00:08:02,822 --> 00:08:05,456
Maybe the thing is
to agree to disagree.

226
00:08:05,457 --> 00:08:07,392
Yeah. Yeah.

227
00:08:07,393 --> 00:08:10,461
I'm sorry, young lady...
for bringing my work here.

228
00:08:11,212 --> 00:08:12,430
Yep.

229
00:08:12,431 --> 00:08:15,233
- He didn't say that?
- He said I bribed judges and stole,

230
00:08:15,234 --> 00:08:17,902
our client is guilty, and I
should never practice law again.

231
00:08:17,903 --> 00:08:18,936
Well, he was drinking.

232
00:08:18,937 --> 00:08:20,603
Which means he's only being
more loose-lipped about

233
00:08:20,604 --> 00:08:21,972
with what he really thinks.

234
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:25,108
Damn it.

235
00:08:25,109 --> 00:08:27,277
Gwyn brings her husband's
fortune to us,

236
00:08:27,278 --> 00:08:28,646
it gets us out of debt.

237
00:08:28,647 --> 00:08:29,947
I know, and it's a good case.

238
00:08:29,948 --> 00:08:31,881
In front of another judge,
we'd win.

239
00:08:33,216 --> 00:08:34,984
What are you thinking,
the same thing?

240
00:08:34,985 --> 00:08:36,385
Move for a recusal?

241
00:08:37,886 --> 00:08:40,022
He says no, you've turned
the judge against you.

242
00:08:40,023 --> 00:08:41,223
He's against me already.

243
00:08:42,224 --> 00:08:44,726
There will be fallout
from the judicial community.

244
00:08:44,727 --> 00:08:45,628
Creary is beloved.

245
00:08:45,629 --> 00:08:46,863
He was beloved.

246
00:08:46,864 --> 00:08:48,530
Judges know he's a loose cannon.

247
00:08:49,031 --> 00:08:52,602
We win this case, we get out
from under the trustee.

248
00:08:55,103 --> 00:08:56,905
We could get
the 27th floor back.

249
00:08:58,406 --> 00:09:00,075
Have Cary argue the
motion for you.

250
00:09:00,076 --> 00:09:01,309
No, Alicia.

251
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:02,611
- Will...
- It's not that.

252
00:09:02,612 --> 00:09:04,613
I think Creary's got a thing
for the ladies.

253
00:09:05,614 --> 00:09:07,215
Oh. Well, don't embarrass him.

254
00:09:07,966 --> 00:09:09,917
Ask for the conference
in chambers.

255
00:09:09,918 --> 00:09:11,786
Have Alicia move for
the recusal there.

256
00:09:11,787 --> 00:09:13,120
And if he says no?

257
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:19,927
This should be
interesting.

258
00:09:20,428 --> 00:09:22,730
Probably too late
to take my advice back.

259
00:09:22,731 --> 00:09:24,531
Probably.

260
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:32,372
Your Honor,
the defense requests

261
00:09:32,373 --> 00:09:34,173
an issues conference
in chambers.

262
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:36,977
What do you need, Counselor?

263
00:09:36,978 --> 00:09:38,177
We have a motion,
Your Honor.

264
00:09:38,178 --> 00:09:40,679
But it would be easier
to present it in chambers.

265
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,515
Oh? And why is that?

266
00:09:42,516 --> 00:09:43,849
Mr. Gardner?

267
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,450
It's a personal matter,
Your Honor.

268
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:47,352
Oh, really, a personal matter?

269
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:48,521
What kind of personal matter?

270
00:09:48,522 --> 00:09:49,889
Please, Your Honor.

271
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:51,824
Well, in chambers it'll be
on the record, Mr. Gardner,

272
00:09:51,825 --> 00:09:53,325
and-and...?

273
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:54,860
Alicia Florrick.

274
00:09:54,861 --> 00:09:56,394
Ah, the state's attorney's wife.

275
00:09:56,395 --> 00:09:57,996
Very fortuitous.

276
00:09:57,997 --> 00:10:00,064
In there and in here,
it'll be on the record,

277
00:10:00,065 --> 00:10:02,867
so if you have a motion,
let's hear it.

278
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,742
Your Honor, we move
that you recuse yourself.

279
00:10:12,911 --> 00:10:14,778
Oh, really?

280
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,480
Now, why should I recuse myself?

281
00:10:17,481 --> 00:10:20,050
You have demonstrated bias
against the defense.

282
00:10:21,585 --> 00:10:22,419
Still licking your wounds

283
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:25,556
about those objections
yesterday, Mr. Gardner?

284
00:10:25,557 --> 00:10:26,957
No, Your Honor, this is
regarding the biased comments

285
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:30,560
you made to Mr. Gardner in the
bar, The Arena, last night.

286
00:10:32,963 --> 00:10:36,065
This is dangerous territory,
Mrs. Florrick.

287
00:10:36,566 --> 00:10:39,101
You called our client guilty,

288
00:10:39,102 --> 00:10:41,871
and you said that Mr. Gardner
was a known liar,

289
00:10:41,872 --> 00:10:44,305
and that he should give up now
because he would lose.

290
00:10:44,556 --> 00:10:47,108
Well, your motion
is denied.

291
00:10:47,359 --> 00:10:49,477
You have any further witnesses?

292
00:10:49,478 --> 00:10:51,980
Your Honor, you showed bias
against us.

293
00:10:51,981 --> 00:10:53,982
I have ruled on your motion,
Mrs. Florrick.

294
00:10:53,983 --> 00:10:56,250
You may sit down now
unless you have another

295
00:10:56,251 --> 00:10:57,786
witness.

296
00:11:04,693 --> 00:11:07,127
You've given us no alternative,
Your Honor,

297
00:11:07,128 --> 00:11:10,263
but to file a motion to
substitute Your Honor for cause.

298
00:11:10,264 --> 00:11:12,265
You what?!

299
00:11:12,266 --> 00:11:14,902
We are filing
for a substitution hearing.

300
00:11:14,903 --> 00:11:17,070
Now, you sit down right now,
Mrs. Florrick.

301
00:11:17,071 --> 00:11:18,705
I have ruled!

302
00:11:18,706 --> 00:11:20,039
And it is not up to you...

303
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,307
No, sir, it is not up to <i>you.</i>

304
00:11:21,308 --> 00:11:22,508
You have no further witnesses,

305
00:11:22,509 --> 00:11:23,977
then we will move toward...

306
00:11:23,978 --> 00:11:25,177
Excuse me,
Your Honor.

307
00:11:25,178 --> 00:11:26,178
It is our right.

308
00:11:26,179 --> 00:11:27,346
No, it is not your right

309
00:11:27,347 --> 00:11:28,581
to disrupt my court.

310
00:11:28,582 --> 00:11:29,682
You're in contempt.

311
00:11:29,683 --> 00:11:31,883
If I make a motion
to substitute, Your Honor,

312
00:11:31,884 --> 00:11:34,419
then it is no longer
in your hands, and you must

313
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,554
transfer this matter
to another judge.

314
00:11:36,555 --> 00:11:38,556
You don't know
what you've just done.

315
00:11:38,557 --> 00:11:39,958
We do, Your Honor,

316
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:41,827
but you've given us
no other choice.

317
00:11:41,828 --> 00:11:43,929
Everybody has a choice.
Everybody.

318
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:47,665
You're fishing for a mistrial
here, and you won't get it.

319
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:49,333
You lose this motion,

320
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:51,902
and I'll be right back here
to judge this case.

321
00:11:51,903 --> 00:11:53,270
We understand that.

322
00:11:53,271 --> 00:11:54,639
So I'll give you one last chance

323
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,306
to step back over that line.

324
00:11:58,743 --> 00:12:01,545
I'm sorry, Your Honor,
but my motion has been made.

325
00:12:01,546 --> 00:12:03,680
We move for a hearing
into your bias

326
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:06,049
against Mr. Gardner
and our client.

Well, we're in it now.

330
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:37,107
We've been ten
percent more successful

331
00:12:37,108 --> 00:12:39,475
in optimizing campaign page
keywords, and that's resulted

332
00:12:39,476 --> 00:12:42,243
in a 20% increase in
organic search traffic.

333
00:12:42,244 --> 00:12:44,378
We've been employing the BLUF
tactic of networking design.

334
00:12:44,379 --> 00:12:46,213
That's Bottom Line Up Front.

335
00:12:46,214 --> 00:12:48,148
I would say this met
with mixed results.

336
00:12:48,149 --> 00:12:50,017
Wait. There's been a 20% jump
in fund-raising?

337
00:12:50,018 --> 00:12:51,118
How did that happen?

338
00:12:51,119 --> 00:12:52,853
Uh, I.T.'s been
better managed.

339
00:12:52,854 --> 00:12:54,655
- By who?
- One of the volunteers.

340
00:12:54,656 --> 00:12:56,557
- Hire him.
- Her.

341
00:12:56,558 --> 00:12:59,026
Do I care?

342
00:13:03,497 --> 00:13:04,965
- You're hired.
- What?

343
00:13:04,966 --> 00:13:07,067
Just keep doing
what you're doing.

344
00:13:10,237 --> 00:13:12,706
Good job, you guys, I'll need
you to stay a little later.

345
00:13:12,707 --> 00:13:14,240
- You got it.
- No problem.

346
00:13:14,241 --> 00:13:15,508
Where are you going, Jay?

347
00:13:15,509 --> 00:13:17,342
Uh, I have to
get back home.

348
00:13:17,343 --> 00:13:19,011
Okay. Tomorrow.

349
00:13:19,012 --> 00:13:21,747
If I can.

350
00:13:21,748 --> 00:13:23,782
- All stand.
- Court is now in session.

351
00:13:23,783 --> 00:13:26,251
The Honorable
Peter Dunaway presiding.

352
00:13:26,252 --> 00:13:27,853
- Uh-oh.
- What?

353
00:13:27,854 --> 00:13:29,254
It's Judge Dunaway.

354
00:13:29,255 --> 00:13:31,956
This is a hearing to determine
whether Judge Harrison Creary

355
00:13:31,957 --> 00:13:35,159
is prejudiced against the
defendant and defense counsel...

356
00:13:37,095 --> 00:13:39,764
...in <i>People v.</i>
<i>Gwyneth Van Zanten.</i>

357
00:13:39,765 --> 00:13:41,232
ASA Hellinger,

358
00:13:41,233 --> 00:13:43,234
do you support Mr. Gardner's
motion to substitute?

359
00:13:43,235 --> 00:13:44,201
No, Your Honor.

360
00:13:44,202 --> 00:13:45,302
The People do not believe

361
00:13:45,303 --> 00:13:47,304
Judge Creary has shown bias
in this case.

362
00:13:47,305 --> 00:13:49,472
Then you will present
the evidence against prejudice,

363
00:13:49,473 --> 00:13:50,507
Mr. Gardner's
representative

364
00:13:50,508 --> 00:13:51,608
will present the
evidence for it.

365
00:13:51,609 --> 00:13:53,376
This hearing is, in effect,

366
00:13:53,377 --> 00:13:55,946
a trial within a trial...

367
00:13:58,582 --> 00:14:00,684
Your Honor Creary,
you don't need to be present

368
00:14:00,685 --> 00:14:02,485
at this hearing.
Are you here to testify?

369
00:14:02,486 --> 00:14:03,653
Uh, no, Your Honor.

370
00:14:03,654 --> 00:14:05,587
I don't want to give this...

371
00:14:05,588 --> 00:14:08,590
mini-persecution any more
attention than it needs.

372
00:14:08,591 --> 00:14:09,959
But I do want
to face my accusers.

373
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,560
Well, that is your
right, Your Honor.

374
00:14:11,561 --> 00:14:15,164
Uh, Judge Creary's prejudice
will be this hearing's

375
00:14:15,165 --> 00:14:17,700
one and only issue, rules
of evidence will apply,

376
00:14:17,701 --> 00:14:19,468
and my ruling will be final.

377
00:14:19,469 --> 00:14:21,102
Is that understood
by all counselors?

378
00:14:21,103 --> 00:14:22,537
- Yes, Your Honor.
- Good.

379
00:14:22,538 --> 00:14:23,972
Then we will begin.

380
00:14:49,462 --> 00:14:50,630
Hi.

381
00:14:51,999 --> 00:14:54,167
I'm Grace.

382
00:14:55,835 --> 00:14:57,870
Uh, sorry.

383
00:14:58,371 --> 00:15:00,405
Uh, that's my real name.

384
00:15:00,906 --> 00:15:02,273
Grace Florrick.

385
00:15:03,274 --> 00:15:05,343
I'm really sorry
about the other Grace.

386
00:15:06,344 --> 00:15:07,545
What do you want?

387
00:15:09,015 --> 00:15:10,849
Why aren't you in class?

388
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:12,317
Why aren't you?

389
00:15:12,318 --> 00:15:14,252
'Cause I saw you come in here.

390
00:15:15,353 --> 00:15:17,054
Look, I don't need
anything, okay?

391
00:15:17,955 --> 00:15:21,125
We broke up. It
was a while ago.

392
00:15:21,126 --> 00:15:22,492
She didn't do it
'cause of me.

393
00:15:23,293 --> 00:15:25,196
You know, you really
shouldn't smoke.

394
00:15:30,668 --> 00:15:31,835
You're the
politician's daughter,

395
00:15:32,336 --> 00:15:33,737
the one caught
with a hooker?

396
00:15:34,038 --> 00:15:35,205
He wasn't caught
with a hooker.

397
00:15:35,206 --> 00:15:37,273
- Class is in session.
- Who's in there?

398
00:15:38,809 --> 00:15:39,976
Shh.

399
00:15:40,977 --> 00:15:43,479
Come out now.
Right now!

400
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,681
If you don't want
to get in trouble,

401
00:15:44,682 --> 00:15:46,915
come out right
this minute!

402
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:48,350
They can't find us here.

403
00:15:48,351 --> 00:15:50,552
I see you in there.

404
00:16:04,599 --> 00:16:06,000
Do you need me to
deal with this, huh?

405
00:16:07,269 --> 00:16:09,070
All right.
All right, bye.

406
00:16:17,412 --> 00:16:18,879
Sorry to keep you waiting,
Mr. Saverese.

407
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,114
Hey, no problem.

408
00:16:21,115 --> 00:16:22,582
About your losing
tow truck bid...

409
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:24,550
we can't sue Strickler
Automotive, but we can appeal

410
00:16:24,551 --> 00:16:25,685
on the basis
of fraud.

411
00:16:25,686 --> 00:16:27,053
But just to
warn you,

412
00:16:27,054 --> 00:16:28,889
they're probably going
to say you cheated, too.

413
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:30,657
Well, I thought
your company was protecting me

414
00:16:30,658 --> 00:16:31,825
against all that crap.

415
00:16:31,826 --> 00:16:33,026
Yeah.

416
00:16:33,027 --> 00:16:34,027
Unfortunately,

417
00:16:34,028 --> 00:16:36,195
Strickler's proven
quite litigious.

418
00:16:36,196 --> 00:16:38,197
Now, there's a chance we
may end up in deposition,

419
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:40,032
so I have to ask you
a few questions.

420
00:16:40,033 --> 00:16:42,134
You were convicted
on a drug charge.

421
00:16:42,135 --> 00:16:44,970
Cocaine. Intent to sell.

422
00:16:44,971 --> 00:16:47,572
- And how many years were you in?
- Two.

423
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:49,374
It was Canadians.

424
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:51,209
You know,
they've got soft hearts.

425
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:55,379
And... you're not involved now

426
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,581
in drugs?

427
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:05,890
What's that suit you're wearing?

428
00:17:06,891 --> 00:17:08,091
Suit?

429
00:17:10,795 --> 00:17:13,130
Uh...

430
00:17:13,131 --> 00:17:14,698
Oh, it's Calvin Klein. Why?

431
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,435
You need a lot of suits
like that to work here, do you?

432
00:17:18,436 --> 00:17:20,170
Yeah. Yeah, some.

433
00:17:20,171 --> 00:17:22,206
But you don't wear suits like
that when you're out and about?

434
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,907
I mean, on weekends, you don't
wear suits like that, do you?

435
00:17:25,908 --> 00:17:26,942
No.

436
00:17:26,943 --> 00:17:29,979
Good, 'cause then people might
think you're gay or something.

437
00:17:34,318 --> 00:17:36,985
Oh... you're not gay, are you?

438
00:17:37,236 --> 00:17:38,620
I'm sorry if...

439
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:44,392
Is something... the matter,

440
00:17:44,393 --> 00:17:45,560
Mr. Saverese?

441
00:17:45,561 --> 00:17:47,762
What, like you being gay?

442
00:17:48,797 --> 00:17:50,966
I don't mind gay people.

443
00:17:53,068 --> 00:17:54,469
Why don't we take this up
tomorrow?

444
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:57,338
Why? Did I offend you?

445
00:17:57,339 --> 00:17:59,039
No. No, I just...

446
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,175
I think we should
take this up tomorrow

447
00:18:01,176 --> 00:18:02,977
when Alicia's back
in the office.

448
00:18:03,778 --> 00:18:06,680
Sure. Sure.

449
00:18:08,683 --> 00:18:11,784
Yeah. I mean, why not pay
for two lawyers, not just one?

450
00:18:11,785 --> 00:18:13,719
Yeah, that's, uh...

451
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,889
That sounds good.

452
00:18:16,723 --> 00:18:19,092
Okay.

453
00:18:30,035 --> 00:18:32,635
I was walking to the bar's restroom

454
00:18:32,823 --> 00:18:34,958
- when I ran into Judge Creary.
- Did you approach him?

455
00:18:34,959 --> 00:18:37,193
No. I was walking past
him, and he called me.

456
00:18:37,194 --> 00:18:39,195
- And what did you talk about?
- He told me

457
00:18:39,196 --> 00:18:41,897
I was losing
and that my client was guilty.

458
00:18:42,498 --> 00:18:43,665
<i>Actus reus.</i>

459
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:45,568
- A guilty act?
- Yes. I told him

460
00:18:45,569 --> 00:18:47,236
he hadn't yet heard
all the evidence,

461
00:18:47,237 --> 00:18:49,905
and that's when he accused me
of being a disbarred lawyer

462
00:18:49,906 --> 00:18:51,340
and of bribing judges.

463
00:18:51,341 --> 00:18:52,508
Ugh! Oh!

464
00:18:52,509 --> 00:18:53,775
Objection. Your Honor,

465
00:18:53,776 --> 00:18:56,344
if Judge Creary would like
to testify, he is welcome,

466
00:18:56,845 --> 00:18:59,380
but he should refrain
from editorializing.

467
00:18:59,381 --> 00:19:00,582
Excuse me. I think

468
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:02,083
His Honor has shown
great patience, young lady.

469
00:19:02,084 --> 00:19:03,585
I know what you think,
Your Honor.

470
00:19:03,586 --> 00:19:05,353
Does that mean
you overrule my objection?

471
00:19:10,258 --> 00:19:12,393
The gallery
should remain silent.

472
00:19:14,328 --> 00:19:16,062
How did the conversation end

473
00:19:16,063 --> 00:19:17,697
with Judge Creary, Mr. Gardner?

474
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:18,965
He told me, if it was up to him,

475
00:19:18,966 --> 00:19:20,667
I would never practice
law again.

476
00:19:20,668 --> 00:19:22,869
Thank you, no further questions.

477
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:25,138
Hello, Mr. Gardner.

478
00:19:25,139 --> 00:19:25,972
Hi, Counselor.

479
00:19:27,775 --> 00:19:30,876
You say Judge Creary accused you
of being a disbarred lawyer,

480
00:19:30,877 --> 00:19:32,345
and that was untrue?

481
00:19:32,346 --> 00:19:34,079
Yes, I was suspended
for six months

482
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,848
but not permanently disbarred.

483
00:19:36,849 --> 00:19:37,483
Congratulations.

484
00:19:37,484 --> 00:19:38,851
Objection.

485
00:19:38,852 --> 00:19:40,553
I'll withdraw that,
Counselor.

486
00:19:42,204 --> 00:19:43,221
Do you know

487
00:19:43,222 --> 00:19:45,490
what the first search result is
when you type "Will Gardner"

488
00:19:45,491 --> 00:19:47,692
into a Chumhum
search engine?

489
00:19:47,843 --> 00:19:50,044
That was a practical
joke by an opponent.

490
00:19:50,045 --> 00:19:51,846
Would you mind reading
what it says there?

491
00:19:54,684 --> 00:19:56,685
"Do you want 'Will Gardner
Disbarred Lawyer'?"

492
00:19:56,686 --> 00:19:58,520
But, again, this is a joke.

493
00:19:58,521 --> 00:20:00,555
But you can understand
why he might mistake you

494
00:20:00,556 --> 00:20:02,022
for a disbarred lawyer.

495
00:20:02,023 --> 00:20:03,724
The fact that I was
arguing in his court

496
00:20:03,725 --> 00:20:05,959
- might suggest otherwise.
- But it's no secret you've had

497
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,028
troubles this past year.

498
00:20:08,029 --> 00:20:10,731
You were suspended for
stealing money from a client.

499
00:20:10,732 --> 00:20:11,699
- Is that correct?
- Yes,

500
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:12,999
- but I replaced it.
- Judge Creary

501
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,935
called you a thief
and a liar.

502
00:20:15,436 --> 00:20:16,537
Can you really say

503
00:20:16,538 --> 00:20:17,570
those characterizations
are inaccurate?

504
00:20:17,571 --> 00:20:18,571
Objection, Your Honor.

505
00:20:18,572 --> 00:20:19,605
The question is

506
00:20:19,606 --> 00:20:21,708
whether or not
Judge Creary showed bias

507
00:20:21,709 --> 00:20:22,742
by making
these comments,

508
00:20:22,743 --> 00:20:24,076
not whether or not
they were true.

509
00:20:25,577 --> 00:20:26,546
Sustained.

510
00:20:27,414 --> 00:20:29,081
Wow, that's some defense.

511
00:20:29,082 --> 00:20:31,016
Our lawyer may be
a thief and a liar,

512
00:20:31,017 --> 00:20:32,517
but the judge
really can't say it.

513
00:20:32,518 --> 00:20:33,918
Objection.

514
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,754
Sustained.

515
00:20:35,755 --> 00:20:38,089
No further questions,
Your Honor.

516
00:20:41,594 --> 00:20:43,362
I'd like to call
Judge Creary to the stand.

517
00:20:43,363 --> 00:20:46,130
He's had a change of heart
and would like to testify.

518
00:20:47,932 --> 00:20:48,834
<i>You've heard</i>

519
00:20:48,835 --> 00:20:50,801
Mr. Gardner's accusations
against you?

520
00:20:50,802 --> 00:20:52,035
I have.

521
00:20:52,036 --> 00:20:54,739
And did you, in fact,
call him a thief?

522
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:56,206
No, I did not.

523
00:20:57,308 --> 00:20:59,877
Did you offer your opinions
on the current case?

524
00:20:59,878 --> 00:21:00,745
I did not.

525
00:21:00,746 --> 00:21:01,945
Oh, my God, you're lying.

526
00:21:01,946 --> 00:21:02,980
Mr. Gardner,

527
00:21:02,981 --> 00:21:04,715
you'll find yourself
in contempt.

528
00:21:04,716 --> 00:21:07,250
Do you know why Mr. Gardner
would be accusing you of this?

529
00:21:07,251 --> 00:21:09,318
Well, I can only guess
that he had...

530
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:12,121
he had many objections
sustained against him that day

531
00:21:12,122 --> 00:21:13,556
and he thought I was biased.

532
00:21:13,557 --> 00:21:15,658
But everything
else he said about this...

533
00:21:15,659 --> 00:21:17,494
bar encounter is a lie?

534
00:21:18,495 --> 00:21:19,529
Yes.

535
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:23,098
We need to find
a witness from the bar.

536
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:35,844
- Hi.
- Hi.

537
00:21:35,845 --> 00:21:38,646
That was nice,
getting a call.

538
00:21:38,647 --> 00:21:41,816
I'm sorry, did I stop calling
you or you stop calling me?

539
00:21:41,817 --> 00:21:43,785
No, I called you...
you just didn't return.

540
00:21:43,786 --> 00:21:46,520
- Three times.
- Ah, I'm sorry. I'm a jerk.

541
00:21:48,089 --> 00:21:49,156
Mm, so...

542
00:21:49,157 --> 00:21:50,925
how much is
this one worth?

543
00:21:50,926 --> 00:21:52,759
- $80 a glass?
- No, four dollars.

544
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:55,929
- Things are tough in Spain these days.
- Oh, of course.

545
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:58,299
How <i>is</i> the family fortune?

546
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,800
Reduced by 70%.

547
00:21:59,801 --> 00:22:02,802
Ouch. Things are
not great all over.

548
00:22:03,303 --> 00:22:04,403
No.

549
00:22:04,404 --> 00:22:06,372
I read about your firm.

550
00:22:06,373 --> 00:22:08,308
And you.

551
00:22:10,644 --> 00:22:13,446
Where are you going
after this?

552
00:22:13,447 --> 00:22:15,481
- Where am I going?
- Mm-hmm.

553
00:22:15,482 --> 00:22:17,649
I don't know.
What about you?

554
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:20,652
I was gonna go home
and read a briefing.

555
00:22:20,653 --> 00:22:23,488
A big long brief
about farm subsidies.

556
00:22:24,989 --> 00:22:26,891
Sounds like a
Thursday night.

557
00:22:26,892 --> 00:22:29,126
Light some candles,
run a bath,

558
00:22:29,127 --> 00:22:32,863
read about the viability of
ethanol as a fuel supplement.

559
00:22:33,698 --> 00:22:35,766
How viable is it?

560
00:22:35,767 --> 00:22:37,801
Pretty damn viable.

561
00:22:37,802 --> 00:22:40,437
More so than
you might think.

562
00:22:46,243 --> 00:22:48,144
That's not bad
for four dollars.

563
00:22:48,145 --> 00:22:49,946
Oh, I lied... it's
Dominio de Pingus.

564
00:22:49,947 --> 00:22:52,815
It's $180 a glass.

565
00:22:52,816 --> 00:22:55,250
I'll count
pennies tomorrow.

566
00:22:55,251 --> 00:22:57,587
Why aren't you
reading your e-mails?

567
00:22:57,588 --> 00:22:59,722
I sent you three
e-mails today.

568
00:22:59,723 --> 00:23:01,691
I <i>am</i> reading my e-mails.

569
00:23:01,692 --> 00:23:04,426
- Just not mine?
- Well, I always know

570
00:23:04,427 --> 00:23:06,995
when it's important,
you'll seek me out, and...

571
00:23:06,996 --> 00:23:08,797
here you are.

572
00:23:08,798 --> 00:23:10,732
Uh... that one...
that one there.

573
00:23:10,733 --> 00:23:12,501
Click on it.

574
00:23:12,502 --> 00:23:14,703
And now the attachment.
Click on it.

575
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:24,645
Have you been hanging
around schools, Eli?

576
00:23:24,646 --> 00:23:25,880
It's not ours.

577
00:23:25,881 --> 00:23:27,482
This is a tracker
from the other side.

578
00:23:27,483 --> 00:23:29,884
That always sounds so sci-fi.

579
00:23:33,988 --> 00:23:36,223
- Eli...
- It's the other campaign.

580
00:23:36,224 --> 00:23:38,124
They're looking for
vulnerabilities.

581
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:40,292
- She was followed to school?
- This campaign

582
00:23:40,293 --> 00:23:42,028
has become about
family values.

583
00:23:42,529 --> 00:23:45,097
Kresteva has a kid with leukemia...
he wants to make it seem

584
00:23:45,098 --> 00:23:47,967
that you have a smoker
who cuts class.

585
00:23:50,087 --> 00:23:52,321
What is going on
with my life?

586
00:24:00,437 --> 00:24:02,403
<i>- Where are you?
</i>-  <i>We need you over here.</i>

587
00:24:02,404 --> 00:24:03,638
Appreciate the opportunity...

588
00:24:03,639 --> 00:24:04,840
It's not about the opportunity.

589
00:24:04,841 --> 00:24:06,574
The campaign needs you, Jay.

590
00:24:06,575 --> 00:24:09,644
Things are falling apart here,
and they're getting angry at me.

591
00:24:09,645 --> 00:24:10,946
I can't work full-time.

592
00:24:10,947 --> 00:24:12,214
What about after school?

593
00:24:12,215 --> 00:24:13,648
Grace, these trackers

594
00:24:13,649 --> 00:24:15,350
Did you see anyone
follow you to school?

595
00:24:15,351 --> 00:24:16,451
No.

596
00:24:16,452 --> 00:24:17,752
I don't know.

597
00:24:17,753 --> 00:24:18,919
I'll call you again.

598
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,920
Hey, n-n-no...

599
00:24:19,921 --> 00:24:22,089
This is so creepy.

600
00:24:25,026 --> 00:24:26,894
I was sitting on a bench
talking to a friend.

601
00:24:26,895 --> 00:24:28,062
What's wrong with that?

602
00:24:28,063 --> 00:24:29,196
Who's the friend?

603
00:24:29,197 --> 00:24:31,232
- Connor.
- Who's Connor?

604
00:24:31,733 --> 00:24:32,733
A boy.

605
00:24:32,734 --> 00:24:33,900
Grace...

606
00:24:34,901 --> 00:24:35,969
I'm not smoking.

607
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:38,372
I know. I didn't
say you were.

608
00:24:38,373 --> 00:24:39,839
These trackers...

609
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,941
they will find any opportunity

610
00:24:41,942 --> 00:24:43,677
to paint you
in a negative light, Grace.

611
00:24:43,678 --> 00:24:45,845
I know. Is that it?

612
00:24:47,514 --> 00:24:48,814
Mom...

613
00:24:48,815 --> 00:24:51,016
Zach, could you
give us a second?

614
00:24:53,619 --> 00:24:55,154
The girl who...

615
00:24:55,155 --> 00:24:57,689
committed suicide...

616
00:24:57,690 --> 00:24:59,258
why?

617
00:24:59,259 --> 00:25:01,293
Why did she do it?

618
00:25:01,294 --> 00:25:03,962
I don't know.

619
00:25:03,963 --> 00:25:05,530
She was cutting.

620
00:25:05,531 --> 00:25:07,231
She w...

621
00:25:07,232 --> 00:25:09,233
Cutting <i>herself?</i>

622
00:25:09,234 --> 00:25:12,504
It's not that weird;
A lot of girls do it.

623
00:25:12,505 --> 00:25:14,506
Cut themselves? Why?

624
00:25:14,507 --> 00:25:16,608
Why would they do that?

625
00:25:17,976 --> 00:25:20,812
- I don't know.
- Self-hatred?

626
00:25:20,813 --> 00:25:24,315
I... I think
it feels good to heal.

627
00:25:28,187 --> 00:25:30,922
You would tell me
if there's anything wrong?

628
00:25:30,923 --> 00:25:33,490
- I'm not cutting, Mom.
- I know.

629
00:25:33,491 --> 00:25:34,859
It doesn't have to be that.

630
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,694
I just...

631
00:25:36,695 --> 00:25:38,328
I love you, Grace.

632
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:40,763
I love you, too.

633
00:25:40,764 --> 00:25:42,465
I know.

634
00:25:42,466 --> 00:25:44,400
You're a good girl.

635
00:25:57,581 --> 00:25:59,215
So, what do you need, Will?

636
00:25:59,216 --> 00:26:02,418
What do I need?
Why do you think I need anything?

637
00:26:03,253 --> 00:26:05,355
That look on your face.

638
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:07,589
You're beautiful.

639
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:09,458
Oh, yeah?

640
00:26:09,959 --> 00:26:10,759
Mm.

641
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:12,794
The other night with Judge Creary...
Oh.

642
00:26:12,795 --> 00:26:14,696
- What?
- No, I thought it was that.

643
00:26:14,697 --> 00:26:16,598
He denied it.
It's my word against his.

644
00:26:16,599 --> 00:26:17,599
You were there.

645
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,700
So that's why you're here?

646
00:26:18,701 --> 00:26:19,801
No.

647
00:26:19,802 --> 00:26:21,937
But it
wouldn't hurt.

648
00:26:23,138 --> 00:26:24,639
This is why

649
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,741
- I am not gonna do it.
- Do what?

650
00:26:26,742 --> 00:26:29,210
Testify for you.
Creary was just showing off for me

651
00:26:29,211 --> 00:26:31,246
and giving you a hard
time 'cause we dated.

652
00:26:31,247 --> 00:26:33,614
And you're the one who
blew it out of proportion.

653
00:26:33,615 --> 00:26:35,016
He said my client was guilty.

654
00:26:35,017 --> 00:26:36,184
People say a lot of things.

655
00:26:36,185 --> 00:26:37,852
You said that you
returned my phone call.

656
00:26:37,853 --> 00:26:39,354
So this is about not
returning your calls?

657
00:26:39,355 --> 00:26:42,089
No, this is about not seeing
the upside of crossing a judge.

658
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:43,757
The upside is: it's the truth.

659
00:26:43,758 --> 00:26:46,059
And that's your
real goal here?

660
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:47,761
The truth.

661
00:26:49,097 --> 00:26:50,663
We could subpoena you.

662
00:26:50,664 --> 00:26:52,832
Yeah, you could.

663
00:27:01,074 --> 00:27:03,910
Whoa. Cary Agos.

664
00:27:03,911 --> 00:27:06,379
What, you come to tell us
how the other half lives?

665
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:07,846
Still a $200 buy-in?

666
00:27:07,847 --> 00:27:10,582
I don't know...
might be time to raise it.

667
00:27:16,588 --> 00:27:18,823
So, you happy to be back
at your old firm?

668
00:27:18,824 --> 00:27:21,726
Ah, Gardner... he's
got it out for me.

669
00:27:21,727 --> 00:27:24,662
Yeah? Man, he's
got it out for everyone.

670
00:27:25,764 --> 00:27:28,599
Oh, yeah, your boss,
he must be pissed.

671
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,567
You still clerking
with Creary?

672
00:27:30,568 --> 00:27:33,938
Yeah. He is not happy.

673
00:27:33,939 --> 00:27:37,241
But, well, he hasn't
been happy for a while.

674
00:27:37,242 --> 00:27:40,411
Oh, yeah? Why is that,
the double shifts?

675
00:27:40,412 --> 00:27:42,346
No, his wife.

676
00:27:42,347 --> 00:27:44,748
Well, I guess his ex-wife.

677
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:49,485
Is it fair
to consider you

678
00:27:49,486 --> 00:27:51,887
a reluctant witness
here, Mr. Chapin?

679
00:27:51,888 --> 00:27:55,491
It is fair to consider me both
reluctant and really pissed.

680
00:27:55,492 --> 00:27:58,161
- Because you've been subpoenaed?
- Yes.

681
00:27:58,162 --> 00:28:01,029
And because I <i>thought</i> I
was talking to a friend.

682
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:04,066
Now, you are Judge
Creary's law clerk?

683
00:28:06,202 --> 00:28:08,136
Yes. I'm sorry, sir.

684
00:28:08,137 --> 00:28:10,572
- Don't worry.
- After Will Gardner's

685
00:28:10,573 --> 00:28:14,343
suspension, what did you
observe Judge Creary saying

686
00:28:14,344 --> 00:28:17,644
- about Mr. Gardner?
- He called Mr. Gardner a liar

687
00:28:17,645 --> 00:28:20,714
- and a thief. - And these are the
same words that Judge Creary

688
00:28:20,715 --> 00:28:23,249
denied speaking
in their recent bar encounter?

689
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:24,585
Objection, Your Honor.

690
00:28:24,586 --> 00:28:26,186
Sustained.

691
00:28:26,187 --> 00:28:27,688
<i>To your knowledge,</i>

692
00:28:27,689 --> 00:28:30,591
Mr. Chapin, is Judge Creary
the only judge in Cook County

693
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:32,225
who made derogatory
comments about Will

694
00:28:32,226 --> 00:28:34,160
- during his suspension?
- No.

695
00:28:34,161 --> 00:28:35,629
Everyone was talking about it.

696
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:37,764
And all the judges were
joking about it, too.

697
00:28:37,765 --> 00:28:40,766
Which judges in particular
do you recall made comments?

698
00:28:42,204 --> 00:28:43,603
Paver, um...

699
00:28:44,104 --> 00:28:45,137
Worth...

700
00:28:45,138 --> 00:28:47,106
- Ferraro...
- Judge John Ferraro?

701
00:28:48,107 --> 00:28:49,341
Didn't he recently
rule in favor

702
00:28:49,342 --> 00:28:51,544
of Will Gardner on a
vehicular manslaughter suit?

703
00:28:51,545 --> 00:28:52,979
I believe so.

704
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:54,313
Objection, Your Honor.
Relevance.

705
00:28:54,314 --> 00:28:55,480
It's relevant because it proves

706
00:28:55,481 --> 00:28:57,816
a judge is fully capable
of putting personal feelings

707
00:28:57,817 --> 00:29:00,118
about defense counsel aside
when deciding a case.

708
00:29:00,119 --> 00:29:01,452
I quite agree.

709
00:29:01,453 --> 00:29:02,621
Overruled.

710
00:29:03,122 --> 00:29:04,589
<i>We need to move off</i>

711
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:05,924
of the personal
animus strategy.

712
00:29:05,925 --> 00:29:07,893
The key is his prejudging
our client's guilt.

713
00:29:07,894 --> 00:29:10,728
- Well, what about the witness at the bar?
- She won't testify.

714
00:29:10,729 --> 00:29:13,330
- Can't we subpoena her?
- I'm not sure she'll tell the truth.

715
00:29:13,331 --> 00:29:15,966
What else did your friend
say about Creary?

716
00:29:15,967 --> 00:29:17,935
You mean my ex-friend?

717
00:29:17,936 --> 00:29:19,202
Well, since Creary's divorce,

718
00:29:19,203 --> 00:29:21,271
he's been struggling
with alcohol.

719
00:29:21,272 --> 00:29:23,507
- Going to AA?
- Yes. Why?

720
00:29:23,508 --> 00:29:25,375
- Are we sure we want to go there?
- I don't know.

721
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:28,811
If you go nuclear, don't
leave missiles in your silo.

722
00:29:33,799 --> 00:29:35,601
So, are you gonna
go to the funeral?

723
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:39,739
You should go to the funeral.

724
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:42,075
Why are you so
interested in her?

725
00:29:42,076 --> 00:29:44,242
What do you mean?
I'm not interested in her.

726
00:29:44,243 --> 00:29:46,878
All you want to do
is talk about her.

727
00:29:46,879 --> 00:29:49,047
I don't know.

728
00:29:49,048 --> 00:29:51,416
I just feel bad.

729
00:29:51,417 --> 00:29:53,284
I thought you
didn't know her.

730
00:29:53,285 --> 00:29:55,754
I know, but I could
still feel bad.

731
00:29:55,755 --> 00:29:57,823
It's just weird.

732
00:29:57,824 --> 00:29:59,757
Her being dead.

733
00:29:59,758 --> 00:30:01,358
It's not weird.

734
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:03,260
Do you believe in God?

735
00:30:03,261 --> 00:30:05,896
- No.
- Why not?

736
00:30:07,199 --> 00:30:09,299
Why is that funny to you?

737
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:11,102
<i>You're</i> funny.

738
00:30:11,103 --> 00:30:15,304
Girls don't come here
to... talk about God.

739
00:30:17,141 --> 00:30:19,843
They come in here
to have sex?

740
00:30:23,547 --> 00:30:25,782
Is that what she did?

741
00:30:27,484 --> 00:30:29,485
The other Grace?

742
00:30:29,486 --> 00:30:30,853
Uh-huh.

743
00:30:33,054 --> 00:30:34,589
We're not gonna have sex.

744
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:36,825
I didn't ask you.

745
00:30:38,694 --> 00:30:40,996
You're right.

746
00:30:43,332 --> 00:30:45,533
No.

747
00:30:46,835 --> 00:30:48,469
So that's it?

748
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:50,437
I'm late to class.

749
00:30:51,938 --> 00:30:53,340
Tomorrow?

750
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:20,054
Yeah.

751
00:31:20,055 --> 00:31:22,724
Oh, hi.

752
00:31:22,725 --> 00:31:24,124
No, no, that's good.

753
00:31:24,125 --> 00:31:26,493
Do you mind looking
into Judge Creary's drinking?

754
00:31:26,494 --> 00:31:28,529
Okay.
Everything okay?

755
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:31,231
Yeah, my daughter's two steps
away from dating Keith Moon,

756
00:31:31,232 --> 00:31:33,266
but everything's fine.

757
00:31:33,767 --> 00:31:37,437
Look, if you want to go out
for a drink or you want

758
00:31:37,438 --> 00:31:39,406
to speak, just give
me a call, all right,

759
00:31:39,407 --> 00:31:41,641
and I'll get
onto that.

760
00:31:41,642 --> 00:31:42,909
All right,
take care.

761
00:31:46,379 --> 00:31:47,580
Who's that?

762
00:31:47,581 --> 00:31:49,849
Work.

763
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:52,484
The place where I work.

764
00:31:56,705 --> 00:31:58,056
Was it Cary?

765
00:31:58,057 --> 00:32:00,725
It wasn't Cary.

766
00:32:00,726 --> 00:32:05,263
You need to give it a rest on
the whole alpha male thing.

767
00:32:37,827 --> 00:32:38,695
Yeah?

768
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,932
I don't understand.

769
00:32:43,933 --> 00:32:46,001
How can we take
a ten percent dive in I.T.?

770
00:32:46,002 --> 00:32:48,036
We were in the middle
of a reorganization,

771
00:32:48,037 --> 00:32:49,370
and we've hit a bump.

772
00:32:49,371 --> 00:32:50,505
What bump?

773
00:32:50,506 --> 00:32:52,708
I lost my volunteers.

774
00:32:52,709 --> 00:32:53,875
Well, get new ones.

775
00:32:53,876 --> 00:32:55,110
No, there was one I needed.

776
00:32:55,111 --> 00:32:56,244
- And what happened?
- He's in school.

777
00:32:56,245 --> 00:32:57,445
- He can't work any more.
- Are you insane?

778
00:32:57,446 --> 00:32:58,947
He's in school
and he can't work any more?

779
00:32:58,948 --> 00:33:00,481
You tell him he has to work.

780
00:33:00,482 --> 00:33:01,915
He's new.
He's not very committed...

781
00:33:01,916 --> 00:33:03,150
Okay, shut up.

782
00:33:03,151 --> 00:33:05,352
Is he here?

783
00:33:06,287 --> 00:33:08,689
Where?

784
00:33:11,342 --> 00:33:13,327
Jay, this is Eli Gold.

785
00:33:13,328 --> 00:33:14,695
Jay is a new volunteer.

786
00:33:16,664 --> 00:33:18,832
Where are you going?

787
00:33:18,833 --> 00:33:20,566
No, kid, you're staying.

788
00:33:20,567 --> 00:33:23,003
Mr. Gold would like
to offer you a job.

789
00:33:28,709 --> 00:33:30,510
No, let him go.

790
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:37,149
Damn it.

791
00:33:40,052 --> 00:33:42,855
Are you pacing me?

792
00:33:44,957 --> 00:33:46,591
Another round, please.

793
00:33:46,592 --> 00:33:48,592
Two more beers?
Sure.

794
00:33:48,593 --> 00:33:51,162
Want me to get her number
for you?

795
00:33:55,399 --> 00:33:57,334
Do you ever get jealous?

796
00:33:57,835 --> 00:33:58,870
Do I get jealous?

797
00:33:58,871 --> 00:34:00,504
Yeah, why?

798
00:34:00,505 --> 00:34:02,006
Of who?

799
00:34:03,007 --> 00:34:04,207
I don't know.

800
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:05,642
People I'm dating.

801
00:34:05,643 --> 00:34:07,443
When they meet
someone else.

802
00:34:07,944 --> 00:34:09,913
I'm narcissistic enough
to think

803
00:34:09,914 --> 00:34:13,116
women should give up sex
altogether after me.

804
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:16,186
You jealous of someone?

805
00:34:18,022 --> 00:34:20,690
How do you stop being jealous?

806
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,894
You stop caring.

807
00:34:24,895 --> 00:34:26,196
Start seeing other people.

808
00:34:26,197 --> 00:34:28,863
Like anything,
it wears off after a while.

809
00:34:28,864 --> 00:34:30,199
Yeah.

810
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,933
Or... you tell
the person,

811
00:34:31,934 --> 00:34:35,304
"I don't want you
to see other people."

812
00:34:36,272 --> 00:34:38,273
But then you have to be ready
to back it up.

813
00:34:39,858 --> 00:34:41,443
Thank you.

814
00:34:41,444 --> 00:34:43,144
You're welcome.

815
00:34:43,145 --> 00:34:45,946
That's a very genuine
"thank you" from you.

816
00:34:50,085 --> 00:34:52,786
I have to go to
an AA meeting now.

817
00:34:56,024 --> 00:34:57,592
- Hi, thank you.
- Welcome.

818
00:34:57,593 --> 00:34:59,593
- Hello. Welcome.
- Hi.

819
00:34:59,594 --> 00:35:01,060
- Hello.
- Hi.

820
00:35:01,061 --> 00:35:02,095
Oh, is this
your first time?

821
00:35:02,096 --> 00:35:03,330
At this meeting, yeah.

822
00:35:03,331 --> 00:35:04,864
I usually go to the one
across town.

823
00:35:04,865 --> 00:35:06,132
That's great.
Well, welcome.

824
00:35:06,133 --> 00:35:07,534
Thank you.

825
00:35:07,535 --> 00:35:10,203
Actually, I'm looking
for a friend of mine, Harrison.

826
00:35:10,204 --> 00:35:11,904
Do you know if
he's coming tonight?

827
00:35:11,905 --> 00:35:12,972
I don't.

828
00:35:12,973 --> 00:35:14,407
He's usually here by now.

829
00:35:14,408 --> 00:35:17,309
He's doing well,
isn't he?

830
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:18,711
Thank you, Mrs. Vaughn.

831
00:35:18,712 --> 00:35:21,980
Do you attend
Alcoholics Anonymous meetings

832
00:35:21,981 --> 00:35:23,815
with Judge Harrison Creary?

833
00:35:26,385 --> 00:35:28,053
Mrs. Vaughn?

834
00:35:31,957 --> 00:35:33,791
I do.

835
00:35:33,792 --> 00:35:37,128
What does the judge share with
the group at these meetings?

836
00:35:37,129 --> 00:35:38,730
Your Honor,
this is truly outrageous.

837
00:35:38,731 --> 00:35:41,766
Alcoholics Anonymous has a
strict code of confidentiality.

838
00:35:41,767 --> 00:35:43,501
Yes, Counselor, unfortunately,
AA is not covered

839
00:35:43,502 --> 00:35:45,236
by client, patient,
or clergy privileges,

840
00:35:45,237 --> 00:35:47,671
and answers can be
compelled here.

841
00:35:48,172 --> 00:35:50,440
I don't agree with this,
but the law is the law.

842
00:35:50,441 --> 00:35:53,310
Again, what has the judge shared
at these meetings, ma'am?

843
00:35:54,311 --> 00:35:56,846
He recently returned
to addiction

844
00:35:56,847 --> 00:35:58,515
when his wife left him.

845
00:35:58,516 --> 00:36:01,150
This is cruel.

846
00:36:04,821 --> 00:36:08,758
And did he say what happened
when he drank?

847
00:36:09,259 --> 00:36:10,559
He blacked out.

848
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:13,162
Therefore,
if Judge Creary had indeed

849
00:36:13,163 --> 00:36:16,131
prejudged Mrs. Van Zanten for...
what did he call it?...

850
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:17,400
her <i>actus reus...</i>

851
00:36:17,401 --> 00:36:20,402
and if he said as much
to Mr. Gardner at the bar,

852
00:36:20,403 --> 00:36:24,673
then due to his blackouts,
he might not remember it now?

853
00:36:25,574 --> 00:36:27,742
Ms. Hellinger, aren't
you going to object?

854
00:36:28,243 --> 00:36:29,377
Am I going to...?

855
00:36:30,078 --> 00:36:31,345
Yes.

856
00:36:31,846 --> 00:36:32,747
Thank you, Your Honor.

857
00:36:32,748 --> 00:36:34,248
Sustained. Leading.

858
00:36:34,249 --> 00:36:36,082
No further questions,
Your Honor.

859
00:36:38,051 --> 00:36:39,452
<i>I'll keep this short and sweet.</i>

860
00:36:39,453 --> 00:36:42,356
You want to work for your dad's
campaign, I won't stop you.

861
00:36:42,357 --> 00:36:43,757
But I can't speak
for your mother.

862
00:36:43,758 --> 00:36:45,125
Now, if you want
some advice

863
00:36:45,126 --> 00:36:47,994
as to how to present it to your
mother, I would offer it.

864
00:36:48,895 --> 00:36:50,030
Hey.

865
00:36:50,531 --> 00:36:51,564
Who's that?

866
00:36:52,265 --> 00:36:53,332
Connor.

867
00:36:53,533 --> 00:36:54,266
Who's Connor?

868
00:36:54,267 --> 00:36:55,468
Grace's friend.

869
00:36:56,969 --> 00:36:57,970
Grace.

870
00:36:57,971 --> 00:36:58,971
Mr. Gold.

871
00:36:59,472 --> 00:37:00,440
About my mom.

872
00:37:00,441 --> 00:37:02,442
Yes, yes, the best way
to present it to your mom

873
00:37:02,443 --> 00:37:05,244
is that you're becoming a part
of the campaign anyway.

874
00:37:05,245 --> 00:37:08,513
You don't want to hate yourself
by making your dad lose

875
00:37:08,514 --> 00:37:10,315
when there's a chance
you could help your dad win.

876
00:37:10,816 --> 00:37:11,983
Okay.

877
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:16,355
Best not to say I was here.

878
00:37:17,223 --> 00:37:18,690
You weren't here.

879
00:37:41,041 --> 00:37:44,043
I am ready to rule.

880
00:37:44,044 --> 00:37:46,412
This trial has been,
above all, angering.

881
00:37:47,413 --> 00:37:49,515
I believe the defense...
the ostensible defense...

882
00:37:49,516 --> 00:37:52,017
at the moment it seems
to be the prosecution...

883
00:37:52,018 --> 00:37:54,786
they have resorted to rank
character assassination.

884
00:37:54,787 --> 00:37:56,187
They have inflicted

885
00:37:56,188 --> 00:37:58,223
on Judge Harrison Creary
a personal examination

886
00:37:58,224 --> 00:38:00,792
that none of us
could survive.

887
00:38:00,793 --> 00:38:02,060
They...

888
00:38:06,366 --> 00:38:09,533
They have dug
through his confessions.

889
00:38:09,534 --> 00:38:11,335
They have subpoenaed innocent
bystanders and forced them

890
00:38:11,336 --> 00:38:12,936
to testify.
I am,

891
00:38:12,937 --> 00:38:14,171
to be frank, disgusted.

892
00:38:14,172 --> 00:38:16,774
- Your Honor...
- No, sit down.

893
00:38:21,112 --> 00:38:23,614
Unfortunately I believe
the defense has proven its case.

894
00:38:24,615 --> 00:38:26,683
I have doubts about
Judge Creary's memory

895
00:38:26,684 --> 00:38:28,151
of the evening
in question.

896
00:38:28,152 --> 00:38:31,188
To be factually correct
does not mean to be right.

897
00:38:31,189 --> 00:38:32,256
Therefore, I am granting

898
00:38:32,257 --> 00:38:34,358
the defense's motion
to substitute.

899
00:38:34,359 --> 00:38:36,894
This case will be
assigned to a new judge.

900
00:38:51,141 --> 00:38:53,609
Next time in
front of a jury.

901
00:38:53,610 --> 00:38:55,844
I think you'll want to consider
taking a plea first... 25 years?

902
00:38:55,845 --> 00:38:57,145
And why would we do that?

903
00:38:57,146 --> 00:38:59,347
Because your client was
cheating on her husband.

904
00:39:00,348 --> 00:39:01,082
No.

905
00:39:01,083 --> 00:39:04,519
<i>Actus reus...</i> it's not just
Latin for "guilty act."

906
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,954
It's an online forum
for cheating spouses.

907
00:39:05,955 --> 00:39:09,291
That's why Judge Creary
said <i>"Actus reus."</i>

908
00:39:09,292 --> 00:39:12,193
Before his divorce
he visited the forum.

909
00:39:12,194 --> 00:39:14,261
That's when he saw
your client's profile.

910
00:39:14,262 --> 00:39:16,297
Still doesn't mean she killed him.

911
00:39:16,298 --> 00:39:18,598
You're right, but we're
checking the Actus Reus logs,

912
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:20,534
and my guess is, we'll
find somebody else

913
00:39:20,535 --> 00:39:23,437
your client solicited
to murder her husband.

914
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,942
Or you can take the 25 years.

915
00:39:37,684 --> 00:39:40,186
You know I share
an office now.

916
00:39:40,187 --> 00:39:41,988
- So?  - So I don't think
Cary would appreciate

917
00:39:41,989 --> 00:39:44,090
- you sitting at his desk.
- I've just gotten word

918
00:39:44,091 --> 00:39:46,658
that the trackers are
following Zach, too.

919
00:39:46,659 --> 00:39:47,826
Yeah, we knew that.

920
00:39:47,827 --> 00:39:49,494
Yes.

921
00:39:49,495 --> 00:39:51,096
I just wanted to let you know

922
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:53,531
that they're involving your
children in the campaign.

923
00:39:53,532 --> 00:39:54,566
I knew that, too.

924
00:39:55,267 --> 00:39:56,868
I thought you might consider

925
00:39:56,869 --> 00:39:58,270
allowing them to
be interviewed.

926
00:39:58,271 --> 00:39:59,938
No.

927
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:04,075
If Peter loses, you don't want
your kids to blame themselves.

928
00:40:04,943 --> 00:40:08,179
Eli, I'm tired.

929
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:09,613
Please just go.

930
00:40:09,614 --> 00:40:11,548
Okay.

931
00:40:11,549 --> 00:40:12,549
Can't say I didn't try.

932
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:14,718
I won't.

933
00:40:27,748 --> 00:40:29,014
Oh.

934
00:40:29,015 --> 00:40:30,783
Hey, I'm sorry, buddy.

935
00:40:30,784 --> 00:40:31,851
Are you all right?

936
00:40:31,852 --> 00:40:33,918
I hope I didn't
ruin your suit.

937
00:40:34,954 --> 00:40:37,088
Hey, sorry, sorry.

938
00:40:39,191 --> 00:40:40,459
Sorry about that.

939
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:42,493
Hey, let, let me
help you up.

940
00:40:44,797 --> 00:40:46,430
Aah!

941
00:40:50,035 --> 00:40:54,205
What is that,
Calvin Klein?

942
00:41:11,105 --> 00:41:12,773
Hello.

943
00:41:13,807 --> 00:41:16,076
I want to help
with Dad's campaign.

944
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:21,915
Okay, let's talk.

945
00:41:21,916 --> 00:41:23,450
I can help,

946
00:41:23,451 --> 00:41:25,485
and Grace and I are already
part of the campaign

947
00:41:25,486 --> 00:41:26,886
whether we want to
be involved or not.

948
00:41:26,887 --> 00:41:28,088
I don't want
to be part

949
00:41:28,089 --> 00:41:30,289
of the problem, I want to
be part of the solution.

950
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,925
And how do you become
part of the solution?

951
00:41:33,426 --> 00:41:35,261
By helping at the
campaign office.

952
00:41:35,262 --> 00:41:37,096
I'd work on their
computers after school.

953
00:41:37,097 --> 00:41:39,498
It's only a 30-minute drive,
and I'd go straight there.

954
00:41:39,499 --> 00:41:41,200
And you'd only work
in the campaign office?

955
00:41:41,201 --> 00:41:42,535
Yes, Mom,

956
00:41:42,536 --> 00:41:44,403
and I'd still do my homework
afterwards, everything,

957
00:41:44,404 --> 00:41:45,437
I promise.

958
00:41:46,438 --> 00:41:47,638
Should I come back?

959
00:41:47,639 --> 00:41:49,774
No, we're fine.

960
00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:53,278
Okay, I'll think
about it.

961
00:41:53,279 --> 00:41:54,245
Okay.

962
00:41:55,448 --> 00:41:56,481
You will?

963
00:41:56,482 --> 00:41:58,983
I will.

964
00:41:58,984 --> 00:42:01,151
What was that about?

965
00:42:03,955 --> 00:42:05,655
You smell
like cigarette smoke.

966
00:42:05,656 --> 00:42:06,557
It's not me.

967
00:42:06,558 --> 00:42:07,857
- It's him?
