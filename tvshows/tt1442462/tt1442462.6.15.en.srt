Interviewer:<i> I don't understand.
You're suing the gun manufacturer?</i>

33
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:37,103
No, we're suing the designer of the 3-D gun

34
00:01:37,128 --> 00:01:39,195
that malfunctioned and crippled our client.

35
00:01:39,367 --> 00:01:42,201
So why would that make you
a better State's Attorney?

36
00:01:42,203 --> 00:01:44,570
Actions speak louder than words.

37
00:01:44,572 --> 00:01:46,539
I've been actively pursuing

38
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:49,871
cases like this on gun
control for... years.

39
00:01:49,896 --> 00:01:52,388
You've also defended some pretty
bad people, too... for example,

40
00:01:52,413 --> 00:01:54,955
- Lemond Bishop.
- He's no longer a client.

41
00:01:55,816 --> 00:01:59,351
Interviewer: To your knowledge,
has Lemond Bishop contributed

42
00:01:59,353 --> 00:02:01,273
to your campaign or your PAC?

43
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,888
No.

44
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:04,364
Man: She's lying.

45
00:02:04,389 --> 00:02:06,990
- How do you know?
- Because she used to represent Bishop.

46
00:02:07,015 --> 00:02:09,233
And you're giving her a
free ride this Saint crap.

47
00:02:09,258 --> 00:02:12,041
Uh, M-Martin, I benefit just
as much as she does from...

48
00:02:12,066 --> 00:02:13,683
Frank, she got the endorsement.

49
00:02:13,708 --> 00:02:15,962
She lied, and she got the
newspaper's endorsement.

50
00:02:15,987 --> 00:02:17,939
That's a 3-point bump three
days before the election.

51
00:02:17,964 --> 00:02:20,187
So set up more events. I'm here. I'm ready.

52
00:02:21,242 --> 00:02:23,409
Is this another "come to Jesus" moment?

53
00:02:23,411 --> 00:02:26,031
'Cause I don't know how many
more of these I can take, Martin.

54
00:02:26,056 --> 00:02:28,457
Look, I like you, Frank.

55
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:30,782
You're a good man,
possibly even a great one,

56
00:02:30,807 --> 00:02:33,174
and I will do everything
I can to help you win...

57
00:02:33,306 --> 00:02:34,772
But you are too nice.

58
00:02:35,056 --> 00:02:36,956
She's a liar. She told them...

59
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:38,591
Exactly what they wanted to hear,

60
00:02:38,593 --> 00:02:40,559
and I'll bet you every dollar I have

61
00:02:40,584 --> 00:02:43,003
they knew she was lying,
they wanted her to lie...

62
00:02:43,064 --> 00:02:45,705
because people respect
someone who's willing

63
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:47,748
to lie for what they believe in.

64
00:02:47,935 --> 00:02:49,550
It shows strength.

65
00:02:49,585 --> 00:02:51,352
They don't respect the truth.

66
00:02:51,408 --> 00:02:53,526
Every time you said something
self-deprecatingly true

67
00:02:53,574 --> 00:02:56,269
to that editorial board, they
all patted you on the back

68
00:02:56,294 --> 00:02:59,118
- and then snickered behind their hands.
- I won't smear her.

69
00:02:59,143 --> 00:03:00,943
That's always what this comes down to.

70
00:03:00,968 --> 00:03:02,534
I won't go against my principles.

71
00:03:02,559 --> 00:03:04,943
- You disagree with her?
- Yes, on policy.

72
00:03:04,968 --> 00:03:06,502
You disagree with her husband?

73
00:03:06,754 --> 00:03:08,421
- Yes.
- There.

74
00:03:08,446 --> 00:03:11,064
- Don't go after her. Go after him.
- I'm not running against her husband.

75
00:03:11,089 --> 00:03:13,189
Exactly, so there's no
problem going after him.

76
00:03:13,214 --> 00:03:15,774
- He was corrupt.
- What will going after her husband do?

77
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:17,432
It will show what you're against.

78
00:03:17,457 --> 00:03:19,243
Campaigns aren't just
about what you're for.

79
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,165
They're about what you're against.

80
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:22,450
So go after the husband.

81
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:24,483
Josh: <i>For the, uh, uh... </i>

82
00:03:24,508 --> 00:03:26,827
I'm not leaving you in a lurch. Will you
stop saying that? Blah, blah, or whatever.

83
00:03:26,852 --> 00:03:28,302
- Please? Oh, so the whole...
- What's going on?

84
00:03:28,327 --> 00:03:29,940
Nothing. We're...

85
00:03:29,965 --> 00:03:31,266
We've got a problem.

86
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:34,092
- Melissa: We can see that.
- Tell her the problem, Jon.

87
00:03:34,462 --> 00:03:35,677
Okay.

88
00:03:35,702 --> 00:03:37,859
Uh, the first thing I'll do is clean house

89
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,087
and take a look at hiring

90
00:03:39,112 --> 00:03:40,910
going back to Peter
Florrick's administra...

91
00:03:40,935 --> 00:03:43,972
So our tracker just picked
this up outside the hotel.

92
00:03:43,997 --> 00:03:45,130
What's wrong with it?

93
00:03:45,155 --> 00:03:47,369
Peter Florrick brought a new level

94
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:48,879
of cronyism to the Office,

95
00:03:48,904 --> 00:03:50,336
and that's what I'll need to root out.

96
00:03:50,361 --> 00:03:52,344
Uh, the Office needs an upheaval,

97
00:03:52,369 --> 00:03:54,448
not the partial measures of Mr. Florrick.

98
00:03:54,473 --> 00:03:56,602
Okay, so he mentions Peter eight times

99
00:03:56,604 --> 00:03:59,672
- in the space of whatever, a short time.
- Johnny: He's coming after you

100
00:03:59,674 --> 00:04:00,973
- through your husband.
- That's his way

101
00:04:00,975 --> 00:04:02,574
of getting around your, you know,

102
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:04,848
- little thing.
- Your agreement to not go negative.

103
00:04:04,873 --> 00:04:07,379
- So, what do I do, defend Peter?
- No, that's exactly what they want.

104
00:04:07,381 --> 00:04:09,619
I think the time has come
for you to separate yourself.

105
00:04:09,644 --> 00:04:11,738
You need your Sister Soulja moment.

106
00:04:11,763 --> 00:04:13,850
So I should criticize Peter?

107
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:15,841
- Yes, his issues.
- What issues?

108
00:04:15,866 --> 00:04:17,767
- Doesn't matter. Pick one.
- God, this is like high school.

109
00:04:17,792 --> 00:04:19,291
The key is to create a little space

110
00:04:19,293 --> 00:04:21,480
between you and Peter. That way,
Prady can say whatever he wants,

111
00:04:21,505 --> 00:04:23,815
- and none of it will land on you.
- And what's the con?

112
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,106
The con?

113
00:04:25,131 --> 00:04:26,698
Why wouldn't I do this?

114
00:04:26,723 --> 00:04:28,271
The two of you were arguing before.

115
00:04:28,296 --> 00:04:29,474
- Who's against it?
- No.

116
00:04:29,499 --> 00:04:32,107
No, that's not what we were arguing about.

117
00:04:32,273 --> 00:04:34,371
Tell her, big man.

118
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:38,577
(Anxious laugh) Uh...

119
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:40,045
I've been asked to join a campaign

120
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,569
in Sacramento on the 7th.

121
00:04:41,594 --> 00:04:42,994
- The 7th of... ?
- This month,

122
00:04:43,019 --> 00:04:44,451
election day, but don't worry.

123
00:04:44,476 --> 00:04:45,676
You are in great shape.

124
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,985
There's not really anything to be done

125
00:04:46,987 --> 00:04:49,655
- on the campaign at that point.
- And this being Chicago, you know,

126
00:04:49,657 --> 00:04:51,120
there's never any fraud at the polls.

127
00:04:51,145 --> 00:04:52,378
- (Phone rings)
- Come on, Josh. That's not fair.

128
00:04:52,403 --> 00:04:55,493
We've got lawyers for exactly
that kind of thing. Alicia...

129
00:04:55,518 --> 00:04:57,752
- How's he doing on the stand?
- What?

130
00:04:57,865 --> 00:04:59,760
McVeigh, how's he doing on the stand?

131
00:04:59,785 --> 00:05:01,906
Oh, I don't know. I haven't checked in.

132
00:05:01,931 --> 00:05:03,164
That's not why I'm calling.

133
00:05:03,189 --> 00:05:04,355
Louis Canning called you.

134
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,813
- What? Why?
- Uh, he wants to see you.

135
00:05:06,838 --> 00:05:08,691
He's in ICU, but we think it's a good idea.

136
00:05:08,716 --> 00:05:10,049
We? What do you mean?

137
00:05:10,074 --> 00:05:11,540
We think it's a good idea

138
00:05:11,565 --> 00:05:13,459
for you to go and see him
and get him to sign off

139
00:05:13,484 --> 00:05:14,617
on his lawsuit against us.

140
00:05:14,642 --> 00:05:16,020
While he's in the ICU?

141
00:05:16,045 --> 00:05:18,278
- Yes.
- You want me to pull an Ashcroft.

142
00:05:18,303 --> 00:05:20,957
Get him to sign something
when he's weak in the hospital?

143
00:05:20,982 --> 00:05:22,765
No, but you're going
to the hospital anyway,

144
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:24,201
so it would be good for the firm

145
00:05:24,226 --> 00:05:27,120
- if he accepted our reasonable offer.
- Look, just call me when you find out

146
00:05:27,145 --> 00:05:29,154
how McVeigh's doing on the stand, okay?

147
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:32,956
McVeigh: The firearm was devised
through additive manufacturing,

148
00:05:32,981 --> 00:05:36,406
or as it's more popularly
known, 3-D printing.

149
00:05:36,431 --> 00:05:38,440
And it works from software?

150
00:05:38,472 --> 00:05:39,830
Yes, open source file.

151
00:05:39,855 --> 00:05:41,273
So if I type in the words,

152
00:05:41,275 --> 00:05:43,354
uh, "3-D printer gun"

153
00:05:43,379 --> 00:05:46,280
right now, it would come up
with a file just like that?

154
00:05:46,305 --> 00:05:48,234
Yes, uh, Mr. Fife's design

155
00:05:48,249 --> 00:05:50,416
is still currently on his web site.

156
00:05:50,418 --> 00:05:53,485
Polmar: So, once you've downloaded
all the schematics for the gun,

157
00:05:53,487 --> 00:05:56,329
how difficult is it to print one?

158
00:05:56,354 --> 00:05:58,546
Load a spool of plastic into a 3-D printer,

159
00:05:58,571 --> 00:06:00,120
- push "print."
- That's it?

160
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,223
- Yes, that's it.
- Well, dear God, that's appalling.

161
00:06:02,248 --> 00:06:03,714
I mean, how long does it take to print?

162
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:06,439
McVeigh: A gun, Your Honor?
Approximately four hours.

163
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:08,824
Polmar: So, on January the 17...

164
00:06:08,849 --> 00:06:11,283
And this gun, it fires actual bullets?

165
00:06:11,308 --> 00:06:12,874
- Yes, Your Honor.
- And it's plastic,

166
00:06:12,899 --> 00:06:15,176
so you could get it through
a, uh, metal detector.

167
00:06:15,201 --> 00:06:16,634
- Yes, Your Honor.
- Whoof!

168
00:06:16,804 --> 00:06:19,171
Well, thank God for the Second Amendment.

169
00:06:20,307 --> 00:06:22,734
Well, Your Honor, this technology

170
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:24,925
has more to do with the First Amendment

171
00:06:24,979 --> 00:06:27,112
- than the second.
- No, no. Not if the software can kill.

172
00:06:27,114 --> 00:06:28,883
Yes, but it's not the
software that's killing.

173
00:06:29,001 --> 00:06:30,893
Your Honor, if we could
show you what happened next?

174
00:06:30,918 --> 00:06:32,985
Yeah, yeah, of course. My apologies.

175
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:35,771
Um, and I promise I won't let my bias

176
00:06:35,796 --> 00:06:38,012
- impact my decision.
- Thank you, Your Honor.

177
00:06:38,037 --> 00:06:39,750
You've always been very fair,

178
00:06:39,775 --> 00:06:41,296
- so we're counting on that.
- So,

179
00:06:41,321 --> 00:06:43,955
Mr. McVeigh, this is the gun that was taken

180
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,477
to the Cantata Vega Shooting Range?

181
00:06:45,502 --> 00:06:46,668
- Is that correct?
- Yes.

182
00:06:46,693 --> 00:06:48,835
And what happened at that range?

183
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,460
The gun misfired

184
00:06:50,485 --> 00:06:53,067
and sent shrapnel
through an alley partition

185
00:06:53,092 --> 00:06:55,241
and injured the spine of Mr. summerfeldt.

186
00:06:55,266 --> 00:06:56,280
So the misfire

187
00:06:56,305 --> 00:06:58,877
that paralyzed my client was foreseeable?

188
00:06:58,902 --> 00:06:59,989
Yes, by someone

189
00:07:00,014 --> 00:07:01,674
with experience in printing

190
00:07:01,699 --> 00:07:03,887
and testing 3-D printed guns.

191
00:07:03,912 --> 00:07:06,079
And the shooter, Carsten Pope,
did he have that experience?

192
00:07:06,104 --> 00:07:07,370
McVeigh: No, he had never printed

193
00:07:07,395 --> 00:07:09,206
nor fired a gun like that before.

194
00:07:09,231 --> 00:07:10,397
So who should've known?

195
00:07:10,422 --> 00:07:11,816
The gun designer, Mr. Fife.

196
00:07:11,841 --> 00:07:14,041
He is the expert here. He made the gun

197
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:17,334
readily available to the public.
The responsibility is his.

198
00:07:17,359 --> 00:07:19,735
Thank you, Mr. McVeigh.
Nothing further, Your Honor.

199
00:07:20,636 --> 00:07:22,119
He's a good witness.

200
00:07:22,144 --> 00:07:24,470
- Mr. McVeigh, how are you?
- I'm good, thank you.

201
00:07:24,495 --> 00:07:26,043
Good. Thank you very much

202
00:07:26,068 --> 00:07:29,330
for taking us all through this technology.

203
00:07:29,355 --> 00:07:31,488
It just seems to get
more and more complicated,

204
00:07:31,513 --> 00:07:32,983
- doesn't it?
- Oh, yeah, it does.

205
00:07:33,008 --> 00:07:36,910
And culpability, then, gets
more and more complicated,

206
00:07:36,935 --> 00:07:38,849
because it goes through
so many different hands.

207
00:07:38,874 --> 00:07:40,051
Objection, Your Honor.

208
00:07:40,076 --> 00:07:42,091
Ms. Crozier seems to be confused

209
00:07:42,116 --> 00:07:43,582
as to who is on the witness stand.

210
00:07:43,607 --> 00:07:44,783
No. (Chuckles)

211
00:07:44,808 --> 00:07:46,841
I'm just plain confused.

212
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:49,124
It's not like there's one
manufacturer and one...

213
00:07:49,149 --> 00:07:50,520
- Your Honor?
- Yeah, um...

214
00:07:50,545 --> 00:07:52,489
Sustained. Is anybody else

215
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:55,126
really disturbed by all this?

216
00:07:55,151 --> 00:07:56,984
(All talking at once)

217
00:07:57,009 --> 00:07:58,653
Okay, okay, thank you.

218
00:07:58,678 --> 00:08:00,144
That was rhetorical.

219
00:08:00,169 --> 00:08:02,925
Um, no more editorial content from me.

220
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,749
- Ms. Crozier?
- Thank you, Your Honor.

221
00:08:04,774 --> 00:08:06,576
So, Mr. McVeigh,

222
00:08:06,643 --> 00:08:08,495
the shooter, Mr. Pope,

223
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:11,438
sitting right there,
you're not suing him, right?

224
00:08:11,463 --> 00:08:13,862
Actually, I'm not suing
anyone, Ms. Crozier.

225
00:08:13,887 --> 00:08:15,755
You're just an expert witness

226
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,864
who happens to be married

227
00:08:17,889 --> 00:08:19,979
to one of the plaintiff's attorneys.

228
00:08:20,004 --> 00:08:21,688
Sorry, let me rephrase that.

229
00:08:21,713 --> 00:08:23,580
The shooter, Mr. Pope,

230
00:08:23,605 --> 00:08:25,458
the one that your wife is not suing,

231
00:08:25,483 --> 00:08:26,582
he built the gun

232
00:08:26,607 --> 00:08:28,140
that injured Eddie Summerfeldt.

233
00:08:28,211 --> 00:08:29,288
No.

234
00:08:29,313 --> 00:08:30,979
No. No?

235
00:08:31,004 --> 00:08:32,483
- He didn't?
- He didn't build it.

236
00:08:32,508 --> 00:08:34,058
- He printed it.
- But you said that

237
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:36,108
he didn't have any
training in 3-D printing.

238
00:08:36,133 --> 00:08:37,796
- That's correct.
- Do you know where he made...

239
00:08:37,821 --> 00:08:40,036
Or printed, the gun?

240
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:42,448
- In his garage.
- And he spent $25?

241
00:08:42,473 --> 00:08:44,210
- God help us.
- $22.50

242
00:08:44,235 --> 00:08:45,404
in materials,

243
00:08:45,429 --> 00:08:48,593
and $1,795

244
00:08:48,618 --> 00:08:50,224
- for the printer.
- Well, I mean,

245
00:08:50,249 --> 00:08:51,523
I don't know much about guns.

246
00:08:51,548 --> 00:08:53,171
You're the expert there,

247
00:08:53,196 --> 00:08:54,937
but I'm still just trying

248
00:08:54,962 --> 00:08:56,524
to figure out why it is

249
00:08:56,549 --> 00:08:58,182
you're suing my client,

250
00:08:58,207 --> 00:09:01,452
who's merely responsible
for the design of the thing,

251
00:09:01,477 --> 00:09:04,718
and not the shooter, who actually printed

252
00:09:04,743 --> 00:09:06,343
and fired the gun.

253
00:09:06,368 --> 00:09:08,153
Again, ma'am, I'm not suing anyone.

254
00:09:08,178 --> 00:09:10,211
Well, maybe you could
just convince your wife...

255
00:09:10,236 --> 00:09:11,368
Objection, Your Honor.

256
00:09:11,393 --> 00:09:12,552
I'll sustain that.

257
00:09:12,577 --> 00:09:14,752
I just, I-I, I just can't believe it.

258
00:09:14,777 --> 00:09:16,751
Twenty-five dollars.

259
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:36,455
How is it that you make
me feel like I'm 22?

260
00:09:44,766 --> 00:09:46,565
♪ Whoo! ♪

261
00:09:54,076 --> 00:09:55,942
How are you, Mr. Canning?

262
00:09:55,944 --> 00:09:57,544
I'm alive.

263
00:09:57,609 --> 00:09:58,942
But you got a new kidney.

264
00:09:58,967 --> 00:10:00,132
Yes.

265
00:10:00,438 --> 00:10:02,605
Sit, sit there.

266
00:10:05,053 --> 00:10:06,468
So, were you elected?

267
00:10:06,493 --> 00:10:07,965
(Chuckles) No.

268
00:10:08,023 --> 00:10:09,820
Oh, you lost.

269
00:10:09,845 --> 00:10:12,325
No, it's just three days away.

270
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:14,450
Oh.

271
00:10:14,475 --> 00:10:15,608
I voted absentee.

272
00:10:15,633 --> 00:10:16,832
Thank you.

273
00:10:16,857 --> 00:10:18,523
No, against you.

274
00:10:18,548 --> 00:10:19,981
(Chuckles)

275
00:10:26,026 --> 00:10:30,087
- So, Mr. Canning, if you don't mind...
- This girl, this 13-year-old girl,

276
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:33,697
went to head a soccer ball
at her junior league game,

277
00:10:33,722 --> 00:10:36,423
and, uh, her head

278
00:10:36,652 --> 00:10:39,085
hit another girl's head,

279
00:10:39,621 --> 00:10:41,254
and she died.

280
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:43,490
She just...

281
00:10:43,492 --> 00:10:45,838
Dropped to the field, dead.

282
00:10:46,295 --> 00:10:48,428
And I don't even know her name.

283
00:10:50,699 --> 00:10:52,632
But she gave me a kidney.

284
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,900
Can you believe that?

285
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:56,803
I can.

286
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:01,374
So, I swore to myself
before I went into surgery

287
00:11:01,376 --> 00:11:03,777
that I'd do something for her.

288
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,833
If it worked out, if-if it went well,

289
00:11:07,858 --> 00:11:10,386
and I lived that I would do something good.

290
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,171
- For her family?
- Yes.

291
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:15,755
I want to liquidate my stocks.

292
00:11:15,757 --> 00:11:17,657
$18 million.

293
00:11:17,659 --> 00:11:19,315
Give them to her family.

294
00:11:20,362 --> 00:11:22,462
Will you do that for me?

295
00:11:24,074 --> 00:11:26,007
Have you called your estate lawyer?

296
00:11:26,032 --> 00:11:27,830
Yes, he's not returning my calls.

297
00:11:28,003 --> 00:11:30,267
Think he wants to wait
till I'm dead, and then...

298
00:11:30,572 --> 00:11:32,772
Keep all the money in-house.

299
00:11:36,511 --> 00:11:38,845
Who is your estate attorney?

300
00:11:40,069 --> 00:11:41,781
David Lee.

301
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:45,318

I put it up to protect them.

306
00:12:04,845 --> 00:12:08,580
That you'll have to explain,
Mr. Fife. You wanted to

307
00:12:08,582 --> 00:12:11,683
protect my client by
providing schematics for guns

308
00:12:11,685 --> 00:12:13,285
that are undetectable,

309
00:12:13,287 --> 00:12:14,786
untraceable and unregulated?

310
00:12:14,788 --> 00:12:16,421
Yeah, and uncensorable.

311
00:12:16,423 --> 00:12:18,456
So, this is all about the
First Amendment to you?

Yes. Yes, Your Honor.

313
00:12:19,808 --> 00:12:21,441
I-I have the First Amendment right

314
00:12:21,466 --> 00:12:23,132
to put out whatever information I want,

00:12:30,704 --> 00:12:33,271
Sure, I do, but I worry more

320
00:12:33,273 --> 00:12:35,774
about what crazy person will
become the next dictator.

321
00:12:35,776 --> 00:12:38,043
And-and what do dictators confiscate

322
00:12:38,045 --> 00:12:39,693
even before the printing presses? The guns.

323
00:12:39,718 --> 00:12:41,443
- All right, let's move on to...
- Um, Your Honor,

324
00:12:41,468 --> 00:12:44,446
- may Mr. Fife finish the answer?
- Yes, he may.

325
00:12:45,033 --> 00:12:48,260
3-D technology has made it impossible

326
00:12:48,285 --> 00:12:50,018
for dictators to control firearms.

327
00:12:50,043 --> 00:12:53,244
I can e-mail a gun to any
person in the world in seconds.

328
00:12:53,493 --> 00:12:55,393
A rebel fighter in Syria,

329
00:12:55,395 --> 00:12:56,962
a dissident in China,

330
00:12:56,964 --> 00:12:59,164
a freedom fighter in Pakistan.

331
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:03,768
This machine has made
democracy possible worldwide.

332
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:05,437
It is the modern version

333
00:13:05,439 --> 00:13:07,272
of the printing press.

334
00:13:08,642 --> 00:13:10,241
Look, I was watching him, okay, Diane.

335
00:13:10,243 --> 00:13:11,840
- He's still on our side.
- I don't know.

336
00:13:11,865 --> 00:13:14,556
Judge Abernathy ends up feeling
so guilty about his bias,

337
00:13:14,581 --> 00:13:16,488
he sometimes rules against it.

338
00:13:16,513 --> 00:13:19,574
Well, that's harder to do
when the defendant is crazy.

339
00:13:20,331 --> 00:13:22,293
We didn't make him crazy enough?

340
00:13:22,318 --> 00:13:24,667
Yeah. Let me.

341
00:13:24,692 --> 00:13:26,168
Alicia: <i>You're not returning</i>

342
00:13:26,193 --> 00:13:28,367
- Canning's calls.
- Actually, I am.

343
00:13:28,392 --> 00:13:30,058
David, I just came from him.

344
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:33,255
He gave me power of attorney
to liquidate all his stocks

345
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,014
and give all $18 million
to the family of the donor.

346
00:13:36,039 --> 00:13:37,398
- Okay.
- David...

347
00:13:37,871 --> 00:13:39,466
He wants it done now.

348
00:13:41,392 --> 00:13:43,092
Do you know the donor's family?

349
00:13:43,117 --> 00:13:45,292
No, but I'm sure you can
get it from the hospital.

350
00:13:45,317 --> 00:13:46,770
I did get it from the hospital.

351
00:13:46,795 --> 00:13:49,209
The Farsouns... Izzat and Helga.

352
00:13:49,234 --> 00:13:50,900
Their daughter's name was Leila.

353
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,126
Okay.

354
00:13:53,454 --> 00:13:55,850
- Did you contact them?
- I did.

355
00:13:59,704 --> 00:14:01,971
David, if you're waiting
for Mr. Canning to die,

356
00:14:01,996 --> 00:14:03,429
I will bring you up on charges...

357
00:14:03,431 --> 00:14:05,236
They don't want the money for themselves.

358
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:06,954
They want to send it to a charity.

359
00:14:07,078 --> 00:14:10,380
"The strong arm of liberty."

360
00:14:10,421 --> 00:14:12,989
Strong arm of liberty support

361
00:14:13,014 --> 00:14:15,415
the oppressed peoples of Palestine.

362
00:14:16,756 --> 00:14:19,881
You can't let your political
bias impact your representation.

363
00:14:19,906 --> 00:14:22,274
- It's Canning's choice.
- And I'll facilitate his choice

364
00:14:22,299 --> 00:14:24,333
after I get full indemnification,

365
00:14:24,358 --> 00:14:26,024
including a letter from
the State Department

366
00:14:26,049 --> 00:14:27,816
saying this group is kosher.

367
00:14:28,074 --> 00:14:29,421
Appropriate.

368
00:14:29,446 --> 00:14:31,975
It's not illegal to give
to pro-Palestinian causes.

369
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,445
- It is if they support Hamas.
- Do they support Hamas?

370
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:36,927
It's too new for the State
Department to make a determination.

371
00:14:36,952 --> 00:14:38,439
And I'm not spending ten years

372
00:14:38,464 --> 00:14:40,831
in a federal prison for
aiding and abetting terrorists.

373
00:14:40,856 --> 00:14:41,888
(Sighing): Okay.

374
00:14:41,913 --> 00:14:43,519
Let me talk to Canning,

375
00:14:43,544 --> 00:14:45,253
see if he wants to do other good works.

376
00:14:45,278 --> 00:14:46,879
Yes. Maybe he can find other ways

377
00:14:46,904 --> 00:14:48,576
of facilitating the killing of Jews.

378
00:14:51,158 --> 00:14:53,372
- Polmar: <i>Hello again, Mr. Fife.</i>
- Hello back at you.

379
00:14:53,397 --> 00:14:55,951
Now, you made your firearm
software open source

380
00:14:55,976 --> 00:14:57,776
for a very good reason,
isn't that right, Mr. Fife?

381
00:14:57,801 --> 00:15:01,069
You wanted to make it
available to... well, everyone.

382
00:15:01,094 --> 00:15:03,014
Yeah, everyone with a 3-D printer.

383
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:05,131
- Even felons?
- Yes, if they could...

384
00:15:05,156 --> 00:15:06,990
Objection, Your Honor. Relevance.

385
00:15:07,015 --> 00:15:08,347
The defense opened the door.

386
00:15:08,372 --> 00:15:10,208
They argued their constitutional rights

387
00:15:10,233 --> 00:15:11,959
shielded them from culpability.

388
00:15:11,984 --> 00:15:14,378
- We merely want to explore that right.
- Yes, seems fair to me.

389
00:15:14,403 --> 00:15:16,561
- Overruled.
- Polmar: You were saying, Mr. Fife?

390
00:15:16,586 --> 00:15:19,189
Oh, I just saw Ms. Crozier

391
00:15:19,214 --> 00:15:21,393
making a signal towards you, Mr.
Fife. Would you care to explain?

392
00:15:21,418 --> 00:15:23,088
- Oh, no, I didn't.
- Well, I saw you making

393
00:15:23,113 --> 00:15:24,374
what I would interpret

394
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,286
- to be a "go-easy" gesture.
- Crozier: No, Your Honor, I simp...

395
00:15:27,311 --> 00:15:29,792
I was feeling heat coming
from somewhere under...

396
00:15:29,817 --> 00:15:31,597
- I don't know if there's a vent.
- Okay, okay.

397
00:15:31,622 --> 00:15:33,789
Okay, then, let's-let's all stop gesturing.

398
00:15:33,814 --> 00:15:36,848
Mr. Fife seems perfectly capable
of taking care of himself.

399
00:15:36,873 --> 00:15:38,543
- Mr. Fife.
- Yeah, yes.

400
00:15:38,568 --> 00:15:40,638
If a felon could afford a 3-D printer,

401
00:15:40,663 --> 00:15:42,729
uh, he would have access to my software.

402
00:15:42,754 --> 00:15:43,767
And children?

403
00:15:43,792 --> 00:15:45,905
Would you make it available to children?

404
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:47,552
It is available to children,

405
00:15:47,703 --> 00:15:50,782
as is porn, and-and Kim Kardashian's ass,

406
00:15:50,807 --> 00:15:53,145
unless parents put parental
control on their computers.

407
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:54,694
In fact, weren't you quoted as saying,

408
00:15:54,719 --> 00:15:56,739
"I can't wait for the first school shooting

409
00:15:56,764 --> 00:15:59,720
- with a 3-D gun."?
- Objection, Your Honor. Argumentative.

410
00:15:59,745 --> 00:16:01,290
Polmar: I'm just using
his own words, Your Honor.

411
00:16:01,315 --> 00:16:03,998
(Overlapping chatter) Wait. Wait,
wait, wait wait, wait, wait, wait.

412
00:16:04,023 --> 00:16:05,885
Mr. Fife, are these your own words?

413
00:16:05,934 --> 00:16:09,342
Uh, if it was taken from
an interview on noisy, yes.

414
00:16:09,367 --> 00:16:11,163
But they're always taken out of context.

415
00:16:11,188 --> 00:16:12,646
Well, I'm sorry. Please.

416
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:15,643
Supply the context.

417
00:16:15,668 --> 00:16:17,568
Fife: It... (Sighs)

418
00:16:17,899 --> 00:16:20,833
I said, "I can't wait for the
first shooting with a 3-D gun,

419
00:16:20,835 --> 00:16:22,701
"'cause then we'll see
how the government tries

420
00:16:22,703 --> 00:16:24,353
to suppress the printing press."

421
00:16:24,378 --> 00:16:25,933
It was an intellectual argument.

422
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:28,125
Yeah, except you said, "school shooting."

423
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:33,034
Yes. I wa... I was... I
was just being provocative.

424
00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:36,026
I-I was, I was trying to
draw attention to the issues.

425
00:16:36,051 --> 00:16:37,803
I would phrase it differently now,

426
00:16:37,828 --> 00:16:39,013
Your Honor.

427
00:16:39,428 --> 00:16:40,554
Good to know.

428
00:16:40,819 --> 00:16:42,237
- $200,000.
- Oh, come on, Nancy.

429
00:16:42,262 --> 00:16:43,777
Let me take it to my client.

430
00:16:43,802 --> 00:16:46,379
(Laughs) If he's the good cop,

431
00:16:46,404 --> 00:16:48,251
but she's the bad one,
what does that make you two?

432
00:16:48,276 --> 00:16:50,297
- Give us time to talk to our client.
- Come on.

433
00:16:50,322 --> 00:16:51,811
Be honest. The only reason that you're not

434
00:16:51,836 --> 00:16:53,803
going after the shooter
is because he's broke.

435
00:16:53,828 --> 00:16:55,955
- And it wasn't his fault.
- We'll present the offer

436
00:16:56,237 --> 00:16:57,603
and get back to you.

437
00:16:58,923 --> 00:17:00,042
Okay.

438
00:17:05,497 --> 00:17:06,653
Okay.

439
00:17:06,678 --> 00:17:08,177
Well, I'm advising Eddie to take it.

440
00:17:08,202 --> 00:17:10,302
That would be a mistake.
Crozier is on the run.

441
00:17:10,327 --> 00:17:12,730
She has a jackass for a client
and Abernathy on the bench.

442
00:17:12,755 --> 00:17:15,331
Yes, and $200,000 is double
what my client expected.

443
00:17:15,331 --> 00:17:16,480
<i>Our</i> client.

444
00:17:16,505 --> 00:17:18,774
- The client that I brought to you.
- For our judgment.

445
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:21,233
Yeah, for your judgment,
yeah, but not for you politics.

446
00:17:21,493 --> 00:17:22,825
What does that mean?

447
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:24,417
This case is about a young father

448
00:17:24,442 --> 00:17:26,008
confined to a wheelchair
for the rest of his life.

449
00:17:26,033 --> 00:17:27,156
It's not about gun control.

450
00:17:27,181 --> 00:17:29,644
It's also not about the quick
fees you can make from $200,000.

451
00:17:29,669 --> 00:17:31,530
Still got some hard feelings there, Cary?

452
00:17:31,555 --> 00:17:33,909
You mean from you trying to
put me in jail for 15 years?

453
00:17:33,934 --> 00:17:36,821
- No, no. That's ancient history.
- Okay, okay, let's just take a breath.

454
00:17:36,846 --> 00:17:38,779
Let's ask the client what he wants.

455
00:17:38,804 --> 00:17:39,930
Hmm?

456
00:17:42,026 --> 00:17:43,618
Eli: When did the 2:30 tomorrow

457
00:17:43,643 --> 00:17:45,510
get moved to the Black
Business Leaders lunch?

458
00:17:45,535 --> 00:17:47,835
She was supposed to be doing
the rotary, but wha... ?

459
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,035
Why did they get moved?

460
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:50,657
I don't know.

461
00:17:51,659 --> 00:17:52,835
When did it get moved?

462
00:17:53,561 --> 00:17:55,790
- An hour ago?
- What happened an hour ago?

463
00:17:56,029 --> 00:17:57,535
I don't know.

464
00:18:00,071 --> 00:18:02,171
Why the Black Business Leaders?

465
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:04,635
Prady's doing a speech there, too, so...

466
00:18:07,038 --> 00:18:08,304
It's about Peter.

467
00:18:08,329 --> 00:18:09,929
It's about Prady criticizing Peter.

468
00:18:09,954 --> 00:18:11,854
Marissa: I'm thinking
of getting a tramp stamp.

469
00:18:11,879 --> 00:18:13,529
- What do you think?
- She's not defending him, is she?

470
00:18:13,554 --> 00:18:15,187
She's throwing Peter under the bus.

471
00:18:15,212 --> 00:18:17,246
It's about his black hiring practices.

472
00:18:17,271 --> 00:18:19,237
Marissa: I have to go, Dad. Take care.

473
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,434
Marissa, get back in here!

474
00:18:21,459 --> 00:18:23,593
Rebecca Smercornish. I'm a ballistics

475
00:18:23,618 --> 00:18:26,314
and modern trajectory expert with the SAA.

476
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:27,831
So, you're you want to keep going?

477
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:29,393
I had a Joint Justice
Department ATF working group

478
00:18:29,418 --> 00:18:31,335
looking into regulating 3D firearms.

479
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,709
Did you happen to study

480
00:18:32,734 --> 00:18:34,667
under Mr. McVeigh, the plaintiff's

481
00:18:34,692 --> 00:18:35,925
- ballistics expert?
- I did.

482
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:37,649
Crozier: And do you have an opinion

483
00:18:37,674 --> 00:18:39,875
about the testimony that
he's given this afternoon?

484
00:18:39,907 --> 00:18:41,920
Rebecca: I do. Mr. McVeigh is

485
00:18:41,945 --> 00:18:43,364
an excellent ballistics expert,

486
00:18:43,816 --> 00:18:45,580
but I'm afraid he's a bit...

487
00:18:45,716 --> 00:18:47,149
old school.

488
00:18:47,174 --> 00:18:49,502
He specializes in trajectory analysis

489
00:18:49,527 --> 00:18:52,011
and gunshot residue on any weapon

490
00:18:52,036 --> 00:18:53,803
produced in the last 100 years.

491
00:18:53,828 --> 00:18:55,275
But not wiki weapons.

492
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,792
Crozier: And when you examined the gun

493
00:18:56,817 --> 00:18:58,183
at issue in this case,

494
00:18:58,208 --> 00:19:01,176
- did you notice anything unusual?
- I did.

495
00:19:01,201 --> 00:19:02,510
Uh... may I?

496
00:19:02,535 --> 00:19:05,629
I must admit, I worry about
turning this trial into a clinic

497
00:19:05,654 --> 00:19:07,320
on gun-making, but... Yeah, please.

498
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:11,629
The CAD specs provided by Mr. Fife

499
00:19:11,654 --> 00:19:14,077
are for his preferred
version of the firearm.

500
00:19:14,102 --> 00:19:16,292
But given that the file is open source,

501
00:19:16,317 --> 00:19:18,684
it's easy for a user to tweak the design

502
00:19:18,709 --> 00:19:20,475
to his or her taste.

503
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,000
- Can you give us an example?
- Sure.

504
00:19:22,025 --> 00:19:25,193
Imagine you have small hands, like I do.

505
00:19:25,218 --> 00:19:27,196
You just make an adjustment to the program,

506
00:19:27,421 --> 00:19:29,545
and voilÃ ... custom grip.

507
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:31,670
And you can do that to any
part of the gun, easily.

508
00:19:31,695 --> 00:19:34,922
Did Mr. Pope make any adjustments?

509
00:19:34,947 --> 00:19:36,947
Yes, he shortened the barrel.

510
00:19:36,972 --> 00:19:38,005
Not a lot.

511
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:40,405
By less than a 16th of an inch, to 3.43.

512
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:42,696
I'm certain that's why Mr.
McVeigh didn't catch it.

513
00:19:42,721 --> 00:19:44,383
Crozier: And could such a tweak

514
00:19:44,408 --> 00:19:46,616
have contributed to the gun misfiring?

515
00:19:46,641 --> 00:19:47,830
- Rebecca: Yes.
- But could

516
00:19:47,855 --> 00:19:50,073
the designer of the gun... Mr. Fife...

517
00:19:50,098 --> 00:19:51,623
have done anything about this?

518
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:54,390
Could he have prevented Mr.
Pope from making such a tweak?

519
00:19:54,415 --> 00:19:57,098
Rebecca: No. The gun Mr. Pope
brought to the firing range

520
00:19:57,123 --> 00:19:58,322
was the one he made,

521
00:19:58,347 --> 00:19:59,602
with his own tweaks,

522
00:19:59,627 --> 00:20:00,989
for which he is responsible.

523
00:20:01,014 --> 00:20:03,917
Mr. Pope is really the person
who should be sued here.

524
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:07,190
But you can also change the way

525
00:20:07,215 --> 00:20:09,316
- a printer prints, is that right?
- Yeah, it is.

526
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:10,695
The quality of plastic you use

527
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,628
- makes a big difference, too.
- Mm-hmm.

528
00:20:12,653 --> 00:20:14,053
- As does your infill setting...
- Right.

529
00:20:14,078 --> 00:20:15,544
- We're finding, on the new...
- Hello.

530
00:20:15,569 --> 00:20:17,408
May I have our Mr. McVeigh for a moment?

531
00:20:17,433 --> 00:20:18,622
Yes.

532
00:20:18,647 --> 00:20:19,836
Definitely.

533
00:20:20,642 --> 00:20:22,286
Congratulations, by the way.

534
00:20:22,311 --> 00:20:23,620
I heard you tied the knot.

535
00:20:23,645 --> 00:20:25,011
We did. Thanks.

536
00:20:25,254 --> 00:20:27,442
This is not an intellectual exercise.

537
00:20:27,641 --> 00:20:28,807
We're here to win, dear.

538
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,678
Actually, you're here to win.

539
00:20:30,703 --> 00:20:32,230
- I'm here to testify.
- For us.

540
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:34,026
If they know you have doubts,

541
00:20:34,051 --> 00:20:36,536
they'll put you back on
the stand to exploit them.

542
00:20:37,867 --> 00:20:39,734
Where are you going?

543
00:20:39,736 --> 00:20:41,969
To assuage my doubts.

544
00:20:42,205 --> 00:20:45,003
So, the Black Business Leaders.

545
00:20:45,028 --> 00:20:47,341
- It's a good venue.
- It's a very good venue to trash Peter.

546
00:20:47,343 --> 00:20:49,443
- Do I need to be here for this?
- Yes. You're supposed to be

547
00:20:49,445 --> 00:20:50,644
the adult here. When he goes off

548
00:20:50,646 --> 00:20:52,113
on one of his crusades, you steer.

549
00:20:52,115 --> 00:20:53,344
I am steering.

550
00:20:53,369 --> 00:20:55,544
It's the smart move, and if you were here,

551
00:20:55,569 --> 00:20:57,017
instead of off doing, uh, uh...

552
00:20:57,019 --> 00:20:59,569
Peter is finally making
traction with black voters

553
00:20:59,594 --> 00:21:01,603
- and you're gonna screw it up.
- That's not our problem.

554
00:21:01,603 --> 00:21:03,685
Yes, it is your problem. You need Peter.

555
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:05,588
- You need the governor.
- There are three days left

556
00:21:05,613 --> 00:21:08,101
in the campaign, Eli.
We needed the governor.

557
00:21:08,126 --> 00:21:10,046
- We don't now.
- We're up by three.

558
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:12,201
You may not want Peter as a friend,

559
00:21:12,226 --> 00:21:14,226
but you certainly don't
want him as an enemy.

560
00:21:14,251 --> 00:21:16,218
- Oh-ho, what's that mean?
- It doesn't mean anything.

561
00:21:16,243 --> 00:21:18,669
The governor's not going to
come out against his own wife.

562
00:21:20,725 --> 00:21:22,543
Josh, why don't you give us a minute?

563
00:21:23,024 --> 00:21:24,343
Sure.

564
00:21:25,103 --> 00:21:26,602
Always a pleasure, Eli.

565
00:21:30,966 --> 00:21:32,423
I got you that job

566
00:21:32,448 --> 00:21:33,948
- in California.
- You did not get me the job in California.

567
00:21:33,973 --> 00:21:36,930
- You made a phone call.
- And I can withdraw that call.

568
00:21:39,307 --> 00:21:42,502
It's the kind of job that
could make someone's reputation.

569
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:44,357
So you're gonna bad-mouth me

570
00:21:44,382 --> 00:21:46,235
unless I pull back on the
Black Business Leaders?

571
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:47,445
Oh, yes.

572
00:21:47,762 --> 00:21:49,304
Wow.

573
00:21:51,222 --> 00:21:52,488
It's your choice, Jon.

574
00:21:52,623 --> 00:21:55,606
You want that job, you tell Alicia
it's a bad idea to trash Peter,

575
00:21:55,631 --> 00:21:58,400
because it is a bad idea to trash Peter.

576
00:21:58,425 --> 00:22:00,506
You don't need it, this
late in the campaign.

577
00:22:01,876 --> 00:22:03,409
You know you don't.

578
00:22:13,409 --> 00:22:17,553
Now, this is an exact replica of
the 3-D gun that Carsten Pope fired.

579
00:22:17,578 --> 00:22:19,069
Including the tweak.

580
00:22:19,094 --> 00:22:21,919
So this gun should match the
gun that injured my client?

581
00:22:21,944 --> 00:22:24,378
Yes. It was also printed on Pope's printer.

582
00:22:24,403 --> 00:22:26,703
- You want to do the honors?
- Mm.

583
00:22:26,787 --> 00:22:28,753
Just enough to pull the trigger.

584
00:22:28,755 --> 00:22:30,283
Ready?

585
00:22:33,042 --> 00:22:34,736
Diane: Kurt, is that good?

586
00:22:34,761 --> 00:22:38,895
Maybe. I believe that we're
getting catastrophic failure

587
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:42,234
from these guns because the
3-D printer was false feeding.

588
00:22:42,236 --> 00:22:44,603
- False feeding?
- Yeah. I noticed

589
00:22:44,605 --> 00:22:46,304
that the printer was stuttering sometimes,

590
00:22:46,306 --> 00:22:48,573
when it was pulling the
plastic filament off the spool.

591
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:49,674
Now, it resulted

592
00:22:49,676 --> 00:22:51,409
in some layers being skipped,

593
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:53,812
making the barrel too weak in some places

594
00:22:53,814 --> 00:22:56,181
to contain the explosion
when a bullet's fired.

595
00:22:56,183 --> 00:22:57,649
But... is that the designer's fault?

596
00:22:58,429 --> 00:22:59,551
No.

597
00:22:59,553 --> 00:23:01,386
I'll need to get a different printer

598
00:23:01,388 --> 00:23:04,656
and test Fife's design
with and without the tweak.

599
00:23:04,658 --> 00:23:06,472
But it'll take some time.

600
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:09,034
Uh, but as of now?

601
00:23:09,059 --> 00:23:12,574
My expert opinion is...
The printer's to blame.

602
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:14,098
(Blows)

603
00:23:14,334 --> 00:23:16,801
So you think I have the wrong defendant?

604
00:23:17,688 --> 00:23:19,371
Yes.

605
00:23:21,582 --> 00:23:23,649
Alicia:<i> My husband</i> <i>was
a good State's Attorney.</i>

606
00:23:23,674 --> 00:23:25,340
But he made some mistakes.

607
00:23:25,812 --> 00:23:27,879
Some were front page news.

608
00:23:27,881 --> 00:23:29,699
Others weren't.

609
00:23:29,724 --> 00:23:31,727
- There's this saying...
- (Doorbell rings)

610
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,226
There's this saying...

611
00:23:35,676 --> 00:23:36,962
Hi.

612
00:23:36,987 --> 00:23:38,921
- You're early. I thought we said 1:00.
- We did.

613
00:23:38,946 --> 00:23:41,092
But I was thinking about the
Black Business Leaders speech.

614
00:23:41,117 --> 00:23:43,469
Oh, yes. I was just working on it now.

615
00:23:43,494 --> 00:23:47,028
Well, I... I'm having second thoughts.

616
00:23:47,053 --> 00:23:49,354
I think it's a mistake to
throw Peter under the bus.

617
00:23:49,832 --> 00:23:51,202
You do?

618
00:23:51,227 --> 00:23:53,194
I do. I'm worried about
you losing more votes

619
00:23:53,219 --> 00:23:55,626
than you'd gain... old-time
supporters of his, christians.

620
00:23:55,651 --> 00:23:57,461
We've hitched our wagon to
Peter from the beginning.

621
00:23:57,486 --> 00:23:59,987
I'm worried that we might end
up looking like opportunists.

622
00:24:00,247 --> 00:24:02,989
But what about countering Prady's attack?

623
00:24:03,014 --> 00:24:05,383
I looked at the overnights...
the attack doesn't seem

624
00:24:05,385 --> 00:24:06,551
to leave much of a mark.

625
00:24:06,553 --> 00:24:08,320
I'm thinking we play to our base.

626
00:24:08,322 --> 00:24:10,322
- You sure?
- Yes.

627
00:24:10,324 --> 00:24:12,856
For better or for worse,
you guys are a brand.

628
00:24:12,881 --> 00:24:14,848
You're the Florricks. A package deal.

629
00:24:14,873 --> 00:24:17,373
This is the first speech.
It'll be on the teleprompters.

630
00:24:20,118 --> 00:24:21,333
Okay.

631
00:24:21,928 --> 00:24:23,902
Okay. I'll see you at 1:00.

632
00:24:24,727 --> 00:24:27,626
Why are you leaving election day?

633
00:24:30,043 --> 00:24:32,877
This job in Sacramento.
It's a special election.

634
00:24:32,879 --> 00:24:35,105
They... they're in trouble.

635
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:37,225
So it's not because of me. Of us.

636
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:38,416
No.

637
00:24:39,232 --> 00:24:41,060
- Okay.
- Okay.

638
00:24:45,592 --> 00:24:47,116
What's this?

639
00:24:48,058 --> 00:24:49,894
I don't know. It's too far away.

640
00:24:49,896 --> 00:24:51,363
- What is it?
- You amended the suit.

641
00:24:51,365 --> 00:24:53,950
Oh, yes, we did. Based on your test.

642
00:24:53,975 --> 00:24:56,211
- We're suing the maker of the printer.
- But you're still suing

643
00:24:56,236 --> 00:24:58,603
Chris Fife, even though his
design isn't the problem.

644
00:24:58,605 --> 00:25:01,840
Fife's web site links
to the faulty printer.

645
00:25:01,842 --> 00:25:04,869
He specifically advocates its
use, so we're able to backdoor him.

646
00:25:04,894 --> 00:25:07,579
You don't believe that
he is legally negligent.

647
00:25:07,581 --> 00:25:09,251
You just think he's politically offensive.

648
00:25:09,276 --> 00:25:10,345
I think he's both.

649
00:25:10,379 --> 00:25:12,552
He's making it possible for anyone to make

650
00:25:12,577 --> 00:25:14,777
an untraceable, untrackable gun.

651
00:25:14,802 --> 00:25:17,589
- Who do you think will use it?
- That's not a question for lawyers.

652
00:25:17,591 --> 00:25:20,325
That's for politicians.
You want to run? Run.

653
00:25:21,546 --> 00:25:24,146
We need you to testify, Kurt.

654
00:25:24,307 --> 00:25:26,369
- I need you to testify.
- No.

655
00:25:27,205 --> 00:25:28,942
Not for a crusade.

656
00:25:33,852 --> 00:25:35,258
You can talk to him.

657
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:36,659
Oh, that's all right.

658
00:25:36,661 --> 00:25:38,294
It helps.

659
00:25:38,296 --> 00:25:40,997
Squeeze his hand and talk to him.

660
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:48,239
Hi.

661
00:26:01,395 --> 00:26:03,085
So...

662
00:26:07,458 --> 00:26:09,191
I'm here because I need to know

663
00:26:09,193 --> 00:26:11,727
what you want me to do with
your money, Mr. Canning.

664
00:26:12,819 --> 00:26:15,563
This family, they want to give
it to a palestinian charity,

665
00:26:15,588 --> 00:26:18,856
but it might have illegal ties...

666
00:26:20,749 --> 00:26:22,548
(Chuckles)

667
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:26,749
She probably means talk
about something personal.

668
00:26:29,247 --> 00:26:31,748
My daughter's praying
for you, so that's good.

669
00:26:32,383 --> 00:26:35,247
I'm not. Because that
would be hypocritical.

670
00:26:46,331 --> 00:26:49,559
I don't want you to die, Mr. Canning, okay?

671
00:26:51,336 --> 00:26:53,761
I know you're a bad man, but...

672
00:26:54,839 --> 00:26:57,540
(Chuckles)

673
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:01,161
I sort of miss you.

674
00:27:02,747 --> 00:27:04,680
I know. That's weird.

675
00:27:04,682 --> 00:27:06,160
I don't know why.

676
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,160
I seem to have some...

677
00:27:13,149 --> 00:27:15,115
Bad boy issues.

678
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:16,366
(Wry laugh)

679
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:27,061
Get well, Mr. Canning.

680
00:27:40,051 --> 00:27:41,450
Okay.

681
00:27:41,904 --> 00:27:44,368
I am gonna get your money to that charity.

682
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:52,351
Bye.

683
00:27:57,101 --> 00:27:59,635
(Low, indistinct chatter,
footsteps approaching)

684
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,103
Marissa: You're a real dirtbag,

685
00:28:03,128 --> 00:28:04,928
- you know that?
- No, I didn't know that.

686
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:06,404
You're letting my dad bully you.

687
00:28:06,429 --> 00:28:07,800
Marissa, you don't know
what you're talking about.

688
00:28:07,825 --> 00:28:09,495
He threatened to yank your next job

689
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,292
unless you advised Alicia to back down.

690
00:28:11,317 --> 00:28:13,224
Alicia and Peter are better
off standing together.

691
00:28:13,224 --> 00:28:14,661
- They're a package deal.
- Package deal.

692
00:28:14,686 --> 00:28:16,486
Yeah, I heard my dad
say it already, dirtbag.

693
00:28:16,511 --> 00:28:18,044
Well, then Marissa, why don't
you leave me alone, okay?

694
00:28:18,069 --> 00:28:21,277
Your job is to give her chapstick
and breath mints. Not bust my balls!

695
00:28:22,403 --> 00:28:24,907
God, handsome men are so weak.

696
00:28:37,553 --> 00:28:38,854
Kurt McVeigh?

697
00:28:38,856 --> 00:28:41,490
- Yeah?
- You've been served.

698
00:28:41,492 --> 00:28:42,691
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

699
00:28:42,693 --> 00:28:44,059
Who's it from?

700
00:28:44,061 --> 00:28:45,811
Diane Lockhart.

701
00:28:54,623 --> 00:28:58,698
So you used the same Blockstock
3-D printer to make your gun

702
00:28:58,723 --> 00:29:00,236
as Carsten Pope did?

703
00:29:09,775 --> 00:29:11,242
Yes.

704
00:29:12,078 --> 00:29:13,970
And would you characterize it

705
00:29:13,995 --> 00:29:16,162
as a smooth process?

706
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,701
I have nothing to compare it to.

707
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:25,555
(Chuckles)

708
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:27,147
I think your, uh,

709
00:29:27,172 --> 00:29:29,737
witness would appreciate some specificity.

710
00:29:29,762 --> 00:29:31,042
Let me rephrase.

711
00:29:31,633 --> 00:29:35,040
Did you find that when
you were making the gun...

712
00:29:35,568 --> 00:29:37,401
The printer stuttered?

713
00:29:38,237 --> 00:29:39,306
Yes.

714
00:29:39,331 --> 00:29:40,951
Were you able to determine why?

715
00:29:42,325 --> 00:29:47,011
There was too much
friction in the feed tube.

716
00:29:49,617 --> 00:29:52,151
And what effect did this
have on the resulting print?

717
00:29:52,176 --> 00:29:55,719
It prevented the layers of
plastic from being applied evenly.

718
00:29:55,744 --> 00:29:58,144
So when you test-fired
the gun, what happened?

719
00:29:58,169 --> 00:29:59,734
- It misfired.
- So would you say

720
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:01,168
that the fault for this lies

721
00:30:01,193 --> 00:30:04,161
with Blockstock, the
designer of the 3-D printer?

722
00:30:06,229 --> 00:30:07,398
Yes.

723
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:11,251
Your Honor, no offense to my
co-defendants, but I fail to see

724
00:30:11,276 --> 00:30:13,734
how Mr. McVeigh's testimony
is relevant to my client.

725
00:30:13,759 --> 00:30:15,727
Uh, Ms. Lockhart, would
you care to enlighten us?

726
00:30:15,752 --> 00:30:18,186
Mr. Fife's web site links to the Blockstock

727
00:30:18,211 --> 00:30:19,944
- 3-D printer site.
- Your Honor,

728
00:30:19,946 --> 00:30:22,413
that connection is ridiculously tenuous.

729
00:30:22,415 --> 00:30:25,324
Polmar: It's joint and
several liability, Your Honor.

730
00:30:25,349 --> 00:30:27,616
Mr. Fife and Blockstock
were both negligent here.

731
00:30:27,641 --> 00:30:30,175
Therefore we can and should
be able to recover damages

732
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,203
- from both.
- Makes sense to me.

733
00:30:32,329 --> 00:30:34,863
Mr. Fife should make himself comfortable.

734
00:30:50,009 --> 00:30:52,384
So don't you want Diane here and not me?

735
00:30:53,385 --> 00:30:54,885
No.

736
00:30:55,281 --> 00:30:58,182
This is the feed tube from
Carsten Pope's printer.

737
00:30:58,184 --> 00:30:59,901
- Look through it.
- Sure.

738
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,655
- I can't.
- It's clogged.

739
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,668
After Carsten Pope printed his gun,

740
00:31:04,693 --> 00:31:06,893
he made several coffee mugs.

741
00:31:07,159 --> 00:31:09,238
Okay, well, that's oddly innocuous.

742
00:31:09,263 --> 00:31:11,831
You think that's what caused
the misfire, mixing the plastics?

743
00:31:11,856 --> 00:31:14,156
I don't know. That's why we test.

744
00:31:17,591 --> 00:31:20,042
Well, it's intact.

745
00:31:20,067 --> 00:31:21,900
So... that's bad?

746
00:31:22,208 --> 00:31:23,974
Maybe.

747
00:31:23,976 --> 00:31:25,655
Well, the printer worked fine,

748
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,146
which means that the
company's not at fault.

749
00:31:27,171 --> 00:31:29,109
Yeah, it also means that the gun Pope fired

750
00:31:29,134 --> 00:31:30,767
wasn't based on a bad design either.

751
00:31:30,792 --> 00:31:32,919
- Right. Good. Except, you know...
- We have no idea

752
00:31:32,944 --> 00:31:35,445
- why the gun failed.
- Yeah.

753
00:31:35,488 --> 00:31:38,756
But the first order of
business is dropping Blockstock

754
00:31:38,758 --> 00:31:40,634
from the suit. They did nothing wrong.

755
00:31:41,427 --> 00:31:43,035
Yeah.

756
00:31:43,729 --> 00:31:46,230
Man: <i>BBL has always been about... </i>

757
00:31:46,232 --> 00:31:48,091
Woman: Do you want anything for your hair?

758
00:31:48,116 --> 00:31:49,960
No. I'm good. Thank you.

759
00:31:49,985 --> 00:31:51,518
Okay.

760
00:31:54,695 --> 00:31:57,296
You think our campaign managers
know we're alone in here?

761
00:31:57,510 --> 00:32:00,210
I think our campaign managers think

762
00:32:00,212 --> 00:32:01,812
- we're running off together.
- (Chuckles)

763
00:32:01,814 --> 00:32:03,240
We could do worse.

764
00:32:03,265 --> 00:32:05,343
(Phone ringing)

765
00:32:06,519 --> 00:32:08,681
- Go ahead. I don't mind.
- No.

766
00:32:08,706 --> 00:32:11,641
I'm sick of phones. It's always bad news.

767
00:32:11,666 --> 00:32:13,365
Not for you these days.

768
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:16,015
Not that I'm following the polls.

769
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,819
Oh, I think it's too close to call.

770
00:32:17,844 --> 00:32:19,577
Oh, I don't think it is.

771
00:32:19,625 --> 00:32:21,658
Whenever I think I'm
certain about something,

772
00:32:21,683 --> 00:32:22,949
I'm always surprised.

773
00:32:23,647 --> 00:32:26,061
It's a bad process, isn't it?

774
00:32:26,086 --> 00:32:27,259
Horrible.

775
00:32:27,989 --> 00:32:30,178
Anything you'd do differently?

776
00:32:32,675 --> 00:32:34,508
I'd be more honest.

777
00:32:36,694 --> 00:32:38,141
How 'bout you?

778
00:32:38,506 --> 00:32:39,629
The debate.

779
00:32:39,654 --> 00:32:41,120
Oh, right. (Chuckles)

780
00:32:41,356 --> 00:32:43,690
And the closeted charge. I would answer it.

781
00:32:43,715 --> 00:32:45,048
You still can.

782
00:32:45,073 --> 00:32:47,139
No one thinks it's wrong to be gay.

783
00:32:48,706 --> 00:32:50,843
Can I tell you a secret?

784
00:32:51,709 --> 00:32:54,150
Who else but your opponent?

785
00:32:55,025 --> 00:32:57,992
I'm not gay. I'm a jesuit.

786
00:33:00,176 --> 00:33:02,176
I never remarried

787
00:33:02,201 --> 00:33:03,834
because you only get married once.

788
00:33:03,859 --> 00:33:06,556
To remarry is to commit adultery.

789
00:33:08,225 --> 00:33:09,755
It's the God's honest truth.

790
00:33:10,838 --> 00:33:12,504
Wh... why didn't you say that?

791
00:33:12,867 --> 00:33:14,997
Well, we didn't want to lose the gay vote

792
00:33:15,022 --> 00:33:18,924
and-and... besides, it
makes you look weird.

793
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:21,568
What person in this day and age

794
00:33:21,593 --> 00:33:23,515
takes Jesus Christ seriously

795
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:25,507
when he says, "you can't divorce"?

796
00:33:25,532 --> 00:33:27,798
Not someone you want to get a beer with.

797
00:33:31,983 --> 00:33:33,716
You are...

798
00:33:33,804 --> 00:33:35,159
Better than I am.

799
00:33:35,184 --> 00:33:37,050
(Chuckles) No.

800
00:33:37,111 --> 00:33:38,711
Oh, yeah.

801
00:33:38,736 --> 00:33:40,237
Unfortunately.

802
00:33:42,529 --> 00:33:43,662
(Soft knocking at door)

803
00:33:44,695 --> 00:33:46,183
Well...

804
00:33:50,356 --> 00:33:51,691
It's been good fighting you.

805
00:33:51,716 --> 00:33:53,082
Good luck on your speech.

806
00:33:53,804 --> 00:33:55,560
Think I should put something in my hair?

807
00:33:55,585 --> 00:33:57,017
No.

808
00:33:57,042 --> 00:33:58,899
You're perfect.

809
00:34:22,324 --> 00:34:24,490
(Line ringing)

810
00:34:25,086 --> 00:34:26,986
Hello, Eli, how are you?

811
00:34:27,011 --> 00:34:28,544
Well, that depends. Are you sending money

812
00:34:28,569 --> 00:34:30,135
to the palestinians?

813
00:34:33,736 --> 00:34:35,851
I hate these silences, Alicia.

814
00:34:35,876 --> 00:34:37,604
- Where are you hearing this, Eli?
- I just got a call

815
00:34:37,629 --> 00:34:39,114
from a friend in the Justice Department.

816
00:34:39,139 --> 00:34:40,977
He asked me to check if
you're funding some...

817
00:34:41,002 --> 00:34:43,327
Pro-palestinian charity based in Detroit.

818
00:34:43,352 --> 00:34:44,685
It's Dearborn.

819
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:46,359
- And no, I'm not.
- Alicia, what the hell?

820
00:34:46,384 --> 00:34:49,052
- You're sending money to Hamas?
- No, it's not me,

821
00:34:49,077 --> 00:34:50,743
it's Louis Canning. He's sick,

822
00:34:50,768 --> 00:34:52,375
and he wanted to do something nice...

823
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,436
- What, send money to Hamas?
- For the

824
00:34:54,461 --> 00:34:55,900
donor of his kidney.

825
00:34:55,925 --> 00:34:59,794
They wanted to give money
to this charity, and...

826
00:35:00,771 --> 00:35:03,384
There's a possibility that this charity...

827
00:35:04,198 --> 00:35:05,900
Might be connected to Hamas.

828
00:35:05,925 --> 00:35:07,959
So I was checking on
it for him, that's all.

829
00:35:07,984 --> 00:35:10,251
- Why were<i> you</i> checking?
- Because he asked me to

830
00:35:10,276 --> 00:35:13,110
and David Lee wouldn't. So I did.

831
00:35:14,524 --> 00:35:16,830
Oh, Alicia, you're being set up.

832
00:35:16,855 --> 00:35:19,868
- What? What are you...
- This Canning guy is suing you, right?

833
00:35:19,893 --> 00:35:22,264
And David Lee is no friend,
and they both found a way

834
00:35:22,289 --> 00:35:24,153
for you to check on giving money to Hamas.

835
00:35:24,178 --> 00:35:25,348
He's on his deathbed, Eli.

836
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:28,331
Canning's not gonna
prank me on his deathbed.

837
00:35:28,356 --> 00:35:30,116
- Why not?
- Because...

838
00:35:32,451 --> 00:35:34,885
I don't know. I'm giving up.

839
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:36,222
Good-bye.

840
00:35:42,241 --> 00:35:43,807
What's wrong?

841
00:35:43,832 --> 00:35:45,722
Nothing. What do you mean?

842
00:35:46,938 --> 00:35:48,681
You look like something's wrong.

843
00:35:48,706 --> 00:35:51,073
No, but there's been a
change. You look great.

844
00:35:51,101 --> 00:35:53,101
Thanks. What changed?

845
00:35:53,353 --> 00:35:54,852
Go after Peter.

846
00:35:54,877 --> 00:35:57,411
- Go after him?
- Yes, for racial disparities

847
00:35:57,436 --> 00:36:00,437
when he was SA. I gave the
new speech to the teleprompter.

848
00:36:00,612 --> 00:36:02,034
What changed?

849
00:36:02,059 --> 00:36:04,826
Nothing. I was wrong. This
is the smart thing to do.

850
00:36:04,851 --> 00:36:06,194
(Applause and cheering in distance)

851
00:36:06,219 --> 00:36:08,533
Oh, that's Prady. He's doing well.

852
00:36:08,558 --> 00:36:10,491
Yeah. You're next.

853
00:36:10,547 --> 00:36:12,881
Go after Peter. Kill him.

854
00:36:12,906 --> 00:36:14,351
No mercy.

855
00:36:15,822 --> 00:36:17,049
Okay.

856
00:36:20,523 --> 00:36:23,090
Fife: <i>Oh-ho, yeah!</i>

857
00:36:23,167 --> 00:36:27,692
Welcome to the freedom factory.
Just-just signed the lease

858
00:36:27,717 --> 00:36:30,539
and got a copy of the keys right here.

859
00:36:30,564 --> 00:36:33,498
We finally have all this, this elbow room.

860
00:36:33,523 --> 00:36:35,356
And-and the... the heater works.

861
00:36:35,381 --> 00:36:38,415
I, I think about all the
time and money, uh, we wasted

862
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,207
trying to print in my parents' garage.

863
00:36:40,232 --> 00:36:42,509
Yeah, we're not gonna
miss that damn icebox.

864
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:44,000
(Taps key)

865
00:36:44,025 --> 00:36:46,526
(Phone ringing)

866
00:36:48,605 --> 00:36:50,058
McVeigh.

867
00:36:51,817 --> 00:36:53,274
I'm sorry... what?

868
00:36:53,299 --> 00:36:55,432
Have you tried printing the gun

869
00:36:55,457 --> 00:36:57,257
in a cold-temperature environment?

870
00:36:57,282 --> 00:36:58,415
Have I... ? (Stammers)

871
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,406
- Who is this?
- Kalinda.

872
00:37:00,431 --> 00:37:02,932
See, low or fluctuating
temperatures can impede

873
00:37:02,957 --> 00:37:05,991
the layers of plastic
from adhering correctly.

874
00:37:09,022 --> 00:37:10,288
(Applause)

875
00:37:11,283 --> 00:37:13,423
Every politician struggles

876
00:37:13,448 --> 00:37:15,121
with the 11th commandment.

877
00:37:15,146 --> 00:37:16,679
Speak no ill

878
00:37:16,704 --> 00:37:18,649
of your fellow party member.

879
00:37:19,012 --> 00:37:21,146
Because sometimes you just disagree.

880
00:37:21,171 --> 00:37:23,972
But when that disagreement is with someone

881
00:37:23,997 --> 00:37:26,697
who is not just a fellow traveler, but...

882
00:37:27,158 --> 00:37:28,992
In my case, a spouse,

883
00:37:29,046 --> 00:37:30,923
it gets even more complicated.

884
00:37:30,948 --> 00:37:33,190
Because the most insidious form of racism

885
00:37:33,215 --> 00:37:35,757
is unconscious and exists
in our legal system.

886
00:37:35,782 --> 00:37:39,494
- (Line ringing)
- My husband was a good State's Attorney.

887
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,298
But he made some mistakes.

888
00:37:41,323 --> 00:37:43,099
- Johnny: Eli?
- Consider yourself out of a job,

889
00:37:43,124 --> 00:37:44,490
you son of a bitch.

890
00:37:44,515 --> 00:37:46,435
Well, you do what you have to do, Eli.

891
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:48,626
- I'm running a campaign.
- It's already done.

892
00:37:48,651 --> 00:37:50,134
Enjoy the speech.

893
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:53,294
Alicia: There's the saying
"racism without racist."

894
00:37:53,815 --> 00:37:57,617
I think this perfectly
describes Cook County

895
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:59,281
and the SA's office.

896
00:37:59,435 --> 00:38:01,636
(Applause)

897
00:38:05,724 --> 00:38:08,265
I think about all the time
and money, uh, we wasted

898
00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:09,834
trying to print in my parents' garage.

899
00:38:09,859 --> 00:38:11,873
We're not gonna miss that damn icebox.

900
00:38:11,898 --> 00:38:14,895
You knew that printing in cold
temperatures warps the plastic

901
00:38:14,897 --> 00:38:17,562
and weakens the structure
of the gun, didn't you?

902
00:38:18,539 --> 00:38:20,934
This... is a new field

903
00:38:20,936 --> 00:38:23,503
- with a lot of variables...
- A simple yes or no, please.

904
00:38:23,622 --> 00:38:24,788
Yes.

905
00:38:24,813 --> 00:38:26,113
And did you offer any warning

906
00:38:26,138 --> 00:38:27,670
as to the effect of cold temperatures

907
00:38:27,695 --> 00:38:29,195
on the printing process?

908
00:38:29,197 --> 00:38:31,831
No, no, but buyer needs to beware.

909
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:37,770
Five million.

910
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,498
(Clears throat) Excuse me?

911
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,925
You have to drop the suit and
sign this nondisclosure agreement.

912
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:45,316
Fife doesn't have that kind of insurance.

913
00:38:45,341 --> 00:38:46,907
Where is the money coming from?

914
00:38:46,932 --> 00:38:48,532
An interested party has
been following the case.

915
00:38:48,557 --> 00:38:49,633
The NRA?

916
00:38:49,658 --> 00:38:51,158
No, private individuals who understand

917
00:38:51,183 --> 00:38:52,749
the importance of this evolving issue,

918
00:38:52,774 --> 00:38:55,183
and would be willing to
underwrite Fife's defense.

919
00:38:55,208 --> 00:38:57,633
- We have a right to know.
- No, actually, you don't.

920
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,213
But you have the right

921
00:38:59,238 --> 00:39:01,375
to take it, Mr. Summerfeldt,
and drop this suit.

922
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:04,034
Or you don't... and then

923
00:39:04,059 --> 00:39:05,613
my mysterious benefactor

924
00:39:05,638 --> 00:39:08,477
uses his bounty of treasure to destroy you.

925
00:39:09,793 --> 00:39:11,827
So, what do you say, Mr. Summerfeldt?

926
00:39:14,425 --> 00:39:15,854
Canning: <i>Alicia?</i>

927
00:39:15,879 --> 00:39:17,612
- How are you today?
- Good.

928
00:39:17,637 --> 00:39:19,937
- Looks like you might be, too.
- Yeah.

929
00:39:19,962 --> 00:39:22,263
- Getting stronger.
- Good.

930
00:39:22,288 --> 00:39:23,820
So, are you setting me up?

931
00:39:26,495 --> 00:39:28,646
Am I, am I, am I setting you up?

932
00:39:28,671 --> 00:39:30,671
The 18 million you wanted donated...

933
00:39:31,043 --> 00:39:33,043
is that a scheme with David Lee?

934
00:39:34,343 --> 00:39:35,725
I really have...

935
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:37,568
No idea what you're talking about.

936
00:39:37,593 --> 00:39:39,326
You wanted your stocks liquidated

937
00:39:39,351 --> 00:39:41,824
and given to a palestinian charity?

938
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:44,085
- I-I what... ?
- The donor's family.

939
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:46,230
You wanted 18 million given to them.

940
00:39:46,255 --> 00:39:47,754
<i>You</i> wanted to do good.

941
00:39:47,779 --> 00:39:49,908
No, I didn't! What do you
mean, I want to do good?

942
00:39:49,933 --> 00:39:51,433
You don't remember the conversation

943
00:39:51,458 --> 00:39:53,625
we had yesterday? You
gave me power of attorney.

944
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:55,588
Alicia, what the hell?! Where's my money?!

945
00:39:55,613 --> 00:39:57,572
Well, there were some complications.

946
00:39:57,597 --> 00:39:59,962
- That's why I'm here.
- Anesthesia plus tremor meds.

947
00:39:59,987 --> 00:40:02,721
I was in a, in a, in a, in a fugue state!

948
00:40:02,746 --> 00:40:04,979
I can't... where, where, where's my money?!

949
00:40:06,583 --> 00:40:08,249
Right where it belongs.

950
00:40:08,274 --> 00:40:09,640
With David Lee.

951
00:40:09,665 --> 00:40:11,145
- Oh, thank God!
- Hmm.

952
00:40:11,551 --> 00:40:12,883
Okay.

953
00:40:12,908 --> 00:40:14,875
I'm going now.

954
00:40:14,953 --> 00:40:16,953
This was... great.

955
00:40:16,978 --> 00:40:18,744
Always fun talking to you.

956
00:40:18,769 --> 00:40:20,049
Alicia, wait!

957
00:40:20,074 --> 00:40:21,940
Can you, can you hand me my phone?

958
00:40:26,395 --> 00:40:28,265
You mean... this phone here?

959
00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:29,882
Yeah, you know, don't-don't kid around.

960
00:40:29,907 --> 00:40:30,973
Just hand me the phone.

961
00:40:30,998 --> 00:40:32,162
No.

962
00:40:32,702 --> 00:40:34,210
I think it looks good

963
00:40:34,235 --> 00:40:35,864
right...

964
00:40:36,212 --> 00:40:37,491
There.

965
00:40:38,016 --> 00:40:40,293
- Alicia...
- Good seeing you, Mr. Canning.

966
00:40:40,318 --> 00:40:41,818
(Phone ringing) Oh, now it's ringing!

967
00:40:41,843 --> 00:40:43,196
Can you get... ? What... ?

968
00:40:43,221 --> 00:40:44,720
Nurse!

969
00:40:56,642 --> 00:40:58,776
Just came to see how you were doing.

970
00:40:58,992 --> 00:41:00,857
I'll be fine.

971
00:41:01,765 --> 00:41:04,456
But I think I owe you an apology.

972
00:41:06,168 --> 00:41:08,413
I let my political passions

973
00:41:08,438 --> 00:41:10,358
drive a wedge between us.

974
00:41:10,716 --> 00:41:13,157
And that's never been how we do things.

975
00:41:15,728 --> 00:41:17,294
True.

976
00:41:18,873 --> 00:41:20,761
Oh, he of few words.

977
00:41:31,133 --> 00:41:33,000
I think we need to go away together.

978
00:41:34,096 --> 00:41:35,837
Good.

979
00:41:35,987 --> 00:41:38,467
What do you think about
a week in Italy this May?

980
00:41:38,611 --> 00:41:40,645
The Amalfi coast.

981
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:44,505
Actually, I was, uh,
thinking more like tomorrow.

982
00:41:45,774 --> 00:41:48,511
I can't get away for a week.

983
00:41:48,536 --> 00:41:50,669
Yeah, I know.

984
00:41:51,713 --> 00:41:54,696
Three days of deer hunting in Wyoming

985
00:41:54,721 --> 00:41:57,155
with the richest men in the country.

986
00:42:02,101 --> 00:42:04,569
Sure, let's go.

987
00:42:04,594 --> 00:42:07,995
♪ One, two, one, two, three, four... ♪

988
00:42:15,486 --> 00:42:16,933
Hi. I thought you were out.

989
00:42:16,958 --> 00:42:18,090
I was out.

990
00:42:18,115 --> 00:42:19,264
Just getting back.

991
00:42:19,289 --> 00:42:21,095
Uh, listen, I didn't
get to congratulate you.

992
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:22,320
The speech went very well.

993
00:42:22,345 --> 00:42:23,510
It did. Thanks.

994
00:42:23,866 --> 00:42:25,450
So, another 48 hours.

995
00:42:25,475 --> 00:42:27,759
Yeah, yeah. There's a story out

996
00:42:27,784 --> 00:42:29,186
that you're supporting Hamas?

997
00:42:29,211 --> 00:42:30,989
I don't need to worry about that, do I?

998
00:42:31,916 --> 00:42:33,698
- No.
- Good.

999
00:42:34,867 --> 00:42:37,501
Um... listen, I'm not very...

1000
00:42:38,399 --> 00:42:42,167
Not very good at expressing
my feelings, uh...

1001
00:42:42,328 --> 00:42:43,981
So I don't really like to...

1002
00:42:46,744 --> 00:42:48,506
Do you want to come inside?

1003
00:42:48,531 --> 00:42:50,598
No, no, no. I just... I don't know.

1004
00:42:50,623 --> 00:42:53,342
I-I don't know. You
know what? Oh, whatever.

1005
00:42:54,509 --> 00:43:00,551
