1
00:00:04,037 --> 00:00:05,871
Money.

2
00:00:05,872 --> 00:00:07,272
How much money?

3
00:00:07,273 --> 00:00:08,642
Twice what I'm making here.

4
00:00:09,443 --> 00:00:12,142
- And all for the price of your soul.
- Not my <i>whole</i> soul,

5
00:00:12,143 --> 00:00:13,645
just little pieces of it.

6
00:00:14,146 --> 00:00:17,115
Anyway, I heard defense
attorneys have better sex.

7
00:00:17,116 --> 00:00:18,883
If you like
coming from behind.

8
00:00:18,884 --> 00:00:21,352
Oh, God...

9
00:00:25,557 --> 00:00:27,358
- Okay, no.
- Oh, come on, Dana.

10
00:00:27,859 --> 00:00:30,093
- We said no as long as we were coworkers.
- Yeah, we...

11
00:00:30,094 --> 00:00:31,428
- we're still coworkers.
- Yeah,

12
00:00:31,429 --> 00:00:34,031
for one more week.
Not to be too much of a pessimist,

13
00:00:34,032 --> 00:00:35,066
but I don't think
you're gonna survive it.

14
00:00:35,067 --> 00:00:36,634
- Oh, really?
- Yeah. You're like

15
00:00:36,635 --> 00:00:38,335
a cop with one week
left on the job.

16
00:00:38,336 --> 00:00:39,770
They all get shot.

17
00:00:39,771 --> 00:00:41,004
Can't risk the wait.

18
00:00:41,705 --> 00:00:43,673
Cary, I have
a boyfriend.

19
00:00:43,674 --> 00:00:44,974
So do I.

20
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:47,943
Well, my guess
is my boyfriend's

21
00:00:47,944 --> 00:00:50,313
- bigger than yours.
- Oh.

22
00:00:51,549 --> 00:00:52,815
Okay.

23
00:00:52,816 --> 00:00:54,917
These cases, I can't
finish in a week.

24
00:00:54,918 --> 00:00:57,086
- I will them to you.
- Oh... great.

25
00:00:57,087 --> 00:00:59,888
No sex and half your file work--
I really feel like I'm losing here.

26
00:00:59,889 --> 00:01:03,091
Yeah, but you have one less body to
step over on your way to the top.

27
00:01:03,092 --> 00:01:04,759
Must be your boyfriend.

28
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,729
Checking in on me.

29
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:10,165
Hello, dear.
How are you?

30
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,034
I'm good, Cary.
How about you?

31
00:01:13,035 --> 00:01:13,968
I'm good, Matan.

32
00:01:13,969 --> 00:01:15,536
Really? You and Matan?

33
00:01:15,537 --> 00:01:16,870
I just got a call about

34
00:01:16,871 --> 00:01:19,940
an ASA needed at a crime scene
for some kind of legal issue.

35
00:01:19,941 --> 00:01:21,842
I was gonna head down,
but it turns out

36
00:01:21,843 --> 00:01:24,645
Lockhart & Gardner
are the defense attorneys on it.

37
00:01:24,646 --> 00:01:25,979
So lucky you.

38
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:27,481
What's the legal issue?

39
00:01:27,482 --> 00:01:28,882
No idea.

40
00:01:30,252 --> 00:01:31,451
This sounds like hazing.

41
00:01:31,452 --> 00:01:32,519
It does, doesn't it?

42
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,922
Let me give you
the address, <i>dear.</i>

43
00:01:34,923 --> 00:01:37,290
- And that's <i>all</i> I do?
- That's all you do.

44
00:01:37,291 --> 00:01:38,325
Just hit the return key,

45
00:01:38,326 --> 00:01:40,393
and it's on your
computer at work.

46
00:01:40,394 --> 00:01:42,562
But why does it never
seem so simple?

47
00:01:42,563 --> 00:01:44,864
Because you don't
trust technology.

48
00:01:45,165 --> 00:01:47,933
Hey, you guys have all your
bags packed and ready, right?

49
00:01:47,934 --> 00:01:49,868
Because Dad's gonna
be here any minute.

50
00:01:49,869 --> 00:01:51,604
- Hey, Mom?
- Yes?

51
00:01:51,605 --> 00:01:54,172
What do you do when
we're at Dad's?

52
00:01:54,173 --> 00:01:55,507
What do I do?

53
00:01:55,508 --> 00:01:57,042
Uh, not much.

54
00:01:57,043 --> 00:01:59,010
I miss you two.

55
00:01:59,011 --> 00:02:00,879
For about an hour.

56
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,881
And then I do
some laundry,

57
00:02:02,882 --> 00:02:04,682
I read for work. Why?

58
00:02:04,683 --> 00:02:06,718
Do you ever go out?

59
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,687
- Uh, for dinner? Sometimes.
- With friends?

60
00:02:09,688 --> 00:02:10,756
Sometimes.

61
00:02:10,757 --> 00:02:12,923
What friends?

62
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:14,959
Friends from work.
Or clients.

63
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,594
People we know?

64
00:02:17,763 --> 00:02:19,563
No, I don't think you do.

65
00:02:21,032 --> 00:02:23,300
We're just worried
about you, Mom.

66
00:02:23,301 --> 00:02:25,636
Honey...
I'm fine. Really.

67
00:02:25,637 --> 00:02:26,904
Mom, it's work.

68
00:02:26,905 --> 00:02:28,605
Will Gardner.

69
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:30,340
Okay, thanks.

70
00:02:30,341 --> 00:02:33,443
I-I'm gonna...
just take that in there.

71
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:35,645
Hang it up.

72
00:02:35,646 --> 00:02:36,845
I was.

73
00:02:36,846 --> 00:02:37,946
<i>Sorry about</i>

74
00:02:37,947 --> 00:02:38,914
calling you at home.

75
00:02:38,915 --> 00:02:40,182
No problem.
Everything all right?

76
00:02:40,183 --> 00:02:41,784
Yes. Actually,
this is about work.

77
00:02:41,785 --> 00:02:43,819
Oh. Good.

78
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,288
I mean, I'm here.

79
00:02:45,289 --> 00:02:48,223
- Your new hire, the first-year?
- Caitlin.

80
00:02:48,224 --> 00:02:50,159
Yes. A call came in about
the Jin-Pyn account.

81
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,660
She was the only one here.

82
00:02:51,661 --> 00:02:53,995
She went out on it, but I think
she'll need some hand-holding.

83
00:02:53,996 --> 00:02:56,063
Oh, o-okay.
Um, what's it about?

84
00:02:56,064 --> 00:02:59,367
No idea. But the son seems to be
in some kind of legal trouble.

85
00:02:59,368 --> 00:03:00,835
Mom! It's Dad!

86
00:03:00,836 --> 00:03:02,337
I'll be right there.

87
00:03:02,338 --> 00:03:03,871
Do you have the address?

88
00:03:04,572 --> 00:03:06,007
<i>Should have guessed.</i>

89
00:03:06,008 --> 00:03:07,441
What?

90
00:03:07,442 --> 00:03:09,176
Booze cruise.

91
00:03:10,077 --> 00:03:12,813
$50, all the beer
you can drink.

92
00:03:12,814 --> 00:03:15,215
Down there.

93
00:03:15,216 --> 00:03:16,817
You did that in college?

94
00:03:16,818 --> 00:03:19,320
I did a lot of
things in college.

95
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,928
Only one band.

96
00:03:30,496 --> 00:03:32,031
A seasickness band.

97
00:03:32,032 --> 00:03:34,634
You wear them in pairs.

98
00:03:34,635 --> 00:03:36,336
You're not gonna leave.

99
00:03:36,337 --> 00:03:38,103
You're too
good at this.

100
00:03:38,104 --> 00:03:41,373
That's what they say to the cop
with only one week left.

101
00:03:41,374 --> 00:03:42,274
<i>Five miles out</i>

102
00:03:42,275 --> 00:03:46,145
someone found the deceased,
a Maya Nichols, below deck,

103
00:03:46,146 --> 00:03:47,679
called the police.

104
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,715
Witnesses say she was
getting unwanted attention

105
00:03:49,716 --> 00:03:51,183
from two college kids.

106
00:03:51,184 --> 00:03:54,786
We were just about to haul 'em
in for a suspect rape exam

107
00:03:54,787 --> 00:03:56,654
when this joker showed up.

108
00:03:56,655 --> 00:03:58,990
You are the authority here?

109
00:03:58,991 --> 00:04:00,892
I am. What seems
to be the problem?

110
00:04:00,893 --> 00:04:03,461
The problem is, Mr. Anders
is the son of a Dutch courier

111
00:04:03,462 --> 00:04:06,297
at our embassy, and is therefore
covered by diplomatic immunity.

112
00:04:06,298 --> 00:04:09,000
- I was not there! I was not!
- These are my papers,

113
00:04:09,001 --> 00:04:10,570
and these are the papers
of Mr. Anders.

114
00:04:10,771 --> 00:04:11,701
Who's that?

115
00:04:11,702 --> 00:04:12,903
Uh, Jin-Pyn.

116
00:04:12,904 --> 00:04:15,239
Supposedly, he's got
diplomatic immunity, too.

117
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,607
Chinese ambassador's
on his way.

118
00:04:17,608 --> 00:04:20,110
Per the Viennese Convention
on Diplomatic Relations,

119
00:04:20,111 --> 00:04:21,811
Mr. Anders is to
be treated...

120
00:04:21,812 --> 00:04:23,713
Yes, I heard you.

121
00:04:24,214 --> 00:04:26,116
- Thought there was some Lockhart/
- Yes.

122
00:04:26,117 --> 00:04:27,549
Me. Here.

123
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:29,284
- I don't think I know you.
- You don't.

124
00:04:29,285 --> 00:04:30,853
Caitlin D'Arcy.
I'm new as of last week.

125
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:33,422
Okay. Well, what do
you have to offer?

126
00:04:33,423 --> 00:04:36,859
Nothing. I'm just taping
everything you do.

127
00:04:38,294 --> 00:04:40,195
Well, uh...

128
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:42,831
I'm Cary Agos, and...
these two youths

129
00:04:42,832 --> 00:04:44,499
are under investigation
for rape and murder.

130
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,468
- They have legal immunity.
- From prosecution, not investigation.

131
00:04:47,469 --> 00:04:49,404
So unless they want to confess,
I'm investigating.

132
00:04:49,405 --> 00:04:51,038
Go ahead, Detective,
take them in.

133
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:52,239
This is illegal.

134
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,209
- Now, who is your boss?
- The People of Illinois.

135
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:57,445
You want their number?

136
00:05:00,014 --> 00:05:01,581
You feeling pretty
good about yourself?

137
00:05:01,682 --> 00:05:04,350
Yeah, but how do I look?

138
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,074
The best IPTV in the UK
WWW.ALLIN1BOX.CO.UK

139
00:05:16,563 --> 00:05:18,964
- Caitlin, what's going on?
- Mrs. Florrick, hello.

140
00:05:18,965 --> 00:05:20,933
He's being accused
of rape and murder.

141
00:05:21,934 --> 00:05:23,569
- Have you told him his rights?
- I was asked

142
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:25,071
to stand outside-- they're
doing a suspect exam.

143
00:05:25,072 --> 00:05:27,673
Chen, my name is
Alicia Florrick.

144
00:05:27,674 --> 00:05:29,442
I'm your parents' lawyer.

145
00:05:29,443 --> 00:05:32,010
It is your right to have me
observe the suspect exam.

146
00:05:32,011 --> 00:05:33,745
Do you approve?

147
00:05:33,746 --> 00:05:36,380
I, uh... yeah.

148
00:05:37,516 --> 00:05:38,483
Ma'am, please,
step back through.

149
00:05:38,484 --> 00:05:40,285
It is his Sixth Amendment
right that I be here.

150
00:05:40,286 --> 00:05:43,087
Chen, did they tell you you
had the right to remain silent?

151
00:05:43,088 --> 00:05:44,456
- I didn't do it.
- I know.

152
00:05:44,457 --> 00:05:46,024
I need you to only talk to me.

153
00:05:46,025 --> 00:05:47,224
- Do you understand?
- I promised Dick

154
00:05:47,225 --> 00:05:49,225
- I wouldn't talk.
- Here. Left earring stud.

155
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:51,862
Blond hair,
two inches long.

156
00:05:51,863 --> 00:05:53,163
Mrs. Florrick?

157
00:05:53,164 --> 00:05:55,499
I'm from the
Dutch embassy.

158
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,634
- I'm here to see Mr. Anders.
- We're getting everything sorted out, sir.

159
00:05:57,635 --> 00:05:58,669
Who's the ASA?

160
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:00,103
I am. Who are you?

161
00:06:00,104 --> 00:06:01,438
- Judge Winter.
- Oh.

162
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:03,639
- I'm-I'm sorry. I...
- Your Honor,

163
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,775
I represent
Mr. Chen Jin-Pyn.

164
00:06:05,776 --> 00:06:07,777
He is the son of
a diplomatic translator,

165
00:06:07,778 --> 00:06:09,144
and therefore
is guaranteed...

166
00:06:09,145 --> 00:06:11,313
Yes, and that's why I was
yanked out of my house

167
00:06:11,314 --> 00:06:12,748
in the middle of the night.
Where is he?

168
00:06:12,749 --> 00:06:15,351
Your Honor, there is strong evidence
that these two men raped and killed...

169
00:06:15,352 --> 00:06:17,419
I'm sorry to say
that's not relevant.

170
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:20,155
Given their immunity status,
you have no right to hold them.

171
00:06:20,156 --> 00:06:23,024
This is a court order requiring
their immediate release.

172
00:06:23,025 --> 00:06:27,061
Your Honor. Cary, you can
hold one of them. Taiwan.

173
00:06:27,062 --> 00:06:28,463
Uh, Your Honor,

174
00:06:28,464 --> 00:06:30,665
excuse me, I-I understand we
have to release Mr. Dick Anders,

175
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:33,267
given his status
as a Dutch citizen, but Jin-Pyn

176
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:34,669
is Taiwanese,
and Taiwan enjoys

177
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:36,436
no such diplomatic status.
How is that?

178
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:38,305
The One China rule.
The U.S. Government

179
00:06:38,306 --> 00:06:40,774
extends diplomatic relations
to China but not Taiwan.

180
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:43,544
Your Honor, this is a gray area.
Not in matters

181
00:06:43,545 --> 00:06:44,812
of diplomatic immunity.

182
00:06:44,813 --> 00:06:47,147
Taiwan is the only nation
not accorded such rights.

183
00:06:48,216 --> 00:06:50,384
Your Honor, this isn't
the United Nations.

184
00:06:50,385 --> 00:06:52,585
You can't just keep one
and let the other go.

185
00:06:52,586 --> 00:06:54,121
Actually, that's
exactly what I can do.

186
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:57,123
I order the release of
Mr. Anders but not Mr. Jin-Pyn.

187
00:06:57,124 --> 00:06:59,125
That is unfair, Your Honor.

188
00:06:59,126 --> 00:07:02,028
Good luck, buddy.
I'm out of here.

189
00:07:02,029 --> 00:07:03,696
Of course it is.
When have you ever known

190
00:07:03,697 --> 00:07:06,799
international politics
to be fair.

191

193
00:07:22,861 --> 00:07:25,027
Well, you really stirred up
the hornet's nest.

194
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:27,595
It was a rape-murder--
I held both suspects

195
00:07:27,596 --> 00:07:29,998
- as long as I could.
- So, where are we?

196
00:07:29,999 --> 00:07:32,200
No semen, but we believe
it was an attempted rape;

197
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:34,403
- She resisted; Chen killed her.
- Murder weapon?

198
00:07:34,404 --> 00:07:36,271
None found.
Blunt head trauma.

199
00:07:36,272 --> 00:07:38,907
What does the
client say happened?

200
00:07:38,908 --> 00:07:40,242
Caitlin?

201
00:07:40,243 --> 00:07:42,643
He says they both
flirted with the victim,

202
00:07:42,644 --> 00:07:44,979
and then his friend Anders
went off with her.

203
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,580
But we can't get to Anders?

204
00:07:46,581 --> 00:07:48,082
No, he was released.

205
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:49,283
Well, that's not good.

206
00:07:49,284 --> 00:07:50,951
What else ties him to the girl?

207
00:07:50,952 --> 00:07:53,954
The blond hair caught
in Chen's left earring stud.

208
00:07:53,955 --> 00:07:55,822
- No pubic hair?
- None.

209
00:07:55,823 --> 00:07:58,325
Oh, Dana, you're still here.

210
00:07:58,326 --> 00:08:00,326
- Six more days of bliss.
- Any blood spatter?

211
00:08:00,327 --> 00:08:02,596
- On Chen, no.
- What do you think the defense will be?

212
00:08:02,597 --> 00:08:04,931
To blame the one that got away.

213
00:08:04,932 --> 00:08:07,066
Too bad there's one
that got away.

214
00:08:07,067 --> 00:08:08,434
And our strategy?

215
00:08:08,435 --> 00:08:10,069
Connect Anders
to the rape.

216
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:12,105
Did the police
do a suspect exam?

217
00:08:12,106 --> 00:08:14,440
On Anders, no.
He was released prior.

218
00:08:14,441 --> 00:08:16,674
Hm. And what about
the blond hair on our guy?

219
00:08:16,675 --> 00:08:19,344
- How does he explain that?
- Chen says they made out.

220
00:08:19,345 --> 00:08:20,445
It was consensual.

221
00:08:20,446 --> 00:08:22,314
Then Chen went to go
buy the victim a drink,

222
00:08:22,315 --> 00:08:24,416
- and Anders took her below deck.
- A drink?

223
00:08:24,417 --> 00:08:26,318
- I thought it was a booze cruise.
- Just beer and wine.

224
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,486
Hard alcohol,
you had to pay.

225
00:08:27,487 --> 00:08:28,721
We have Chen's
credit card receipt

226
00:08:28,722 --> 00:08:30,822
with the time on it,
so if they police can pinpoint

227
00:08:30,823 --> 00:08:32,457
the time of the murder,
we can prove

228
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:34,128
<i>that Chen was on the
other end of the boat.</i>

229
00:08:34,158 --> 00:08:36,928
Eli Gold, ladies and gentlemen.

230
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:39,964
You needed me?

231
00:08:40,065 --> 00:08:43,401
You push this off on me and then
you criticize my handling of it?

232
00:08:43,402 --> 00:08:44,869
I wasn't trying
to criticize you.

233
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,370
Did I give you
that impression?

234
00:08:46,371 --> 00:08:47,738
You did.

235
00:08:47,739 --> 00:08:49,773
My apologies.

236
00:08:51,008 --> 00:08:53,043
<i>What was that about?</i>

237
00:08:53,044 --> 00:08:56,879
We were trying to make you feel part
of the Lockhart/Gardner family.

238
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,948
Don't you want
to feel a part?

239
00:08:58,949 --> 00:09:00,716
Oh. I'm okay.

240
00:09:00,717 --> 00:09:02,085
What do you need?

241
00:09:02,086 --> 00:09:05,120
Lobbying. The son
of a Taiwanese diplomat

242
00:09:05,121 --> 00:09:08,757
is being denied immunity from
prosecution due to the One China rule.

243
00:09:08,758 --> 00:09:11,427
- Oy. That thicket.
- Yep, that thicket.

244
00:09:11,428 --> 00:09:13,295
I thought if you
could talk to someone

245
00:09:13,296 --> 00:09:16,798
quietly, we could make this
go away without much fuss.

246
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:19,600
Know anyone in
the State Department?

247
00:09:21,137 --> 00:09:23,437
Yes?

248
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:25,839
Nothing.

249
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,908
- How important is it?
- Well,

250
00:09:28,409 --> 00:09:31,445
heading into the presidential
campaign, my guess is

251
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:34,249
Taiwan will be spending
a lot on U.S. lobbyists.

252
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:35,583
Could be lucrative...

253
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:37,751
for you.

254
00:09:39,687 --> 00:09:42,355
Okay.

255
00:09:42,356 --> 00:09:44,858
This is not going to be pretty.

256
00:09:44,859 --> 00:09:47,828
Sorry you had to see that.
Definitely not my finest hour.

257
00:09:47,829 --> 00:09:49,696
<i>No,</i> it's cool.
You were a good judge.

258
00:09:49,697 --> 00:09:51,397
Okay, the less said
about that, the better.

259
00:09:51,398 --> 00:09:53,199
Oh, Alicia, hey.

260
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,868
Mr. Gardner was a judge in my
intercollegiate moot court.

261
00:09:55,869 --> 00:09:57,069
Really?

262
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:59,705
Mm-hmm.
Till I was removed. Bias.

263
00:09:59,706 --> 00:10:01,407
Yeah, they had, like,
some 60-year-old come in.

264
00:10:01,408 --> 00:10:02,574
Anyway...

265
00:10:02,575 --> 00:10:04,543
- Yeah. Caitlin.
- Oh, sorry.

266
00:10:04,544 --> 00:10:06,279
- Orientation, right?
- Go get orientated.

267
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:09,580
So, this binder has all
your human resource forms,

268
00:10:09,581 --> 00:10:12,583
a fax sheet on billing,
ABA, pro bono requirements.

269
00:10:12,584 --> 00:10:13,985
Great, thanks.

270
00:10:13,986 --> 00:10:15,987
- He's nice, isn't he?
- Who, Will Gardner?

271
00:10:15,988 --> 00:10:18,089
Yes. So is Diane.
They're both also busy.

272
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:20,558
So if there's anything you
need, you come to me first.

273
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:23,294
- Oh, I'm sorry. Did I just embarrass myself?
- No, no, no, you did fine.

274
00:10:23,295 --> 00:10:24,629
Oh, God, I did, didn't I?

275
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:27,064
Caitlin, you were fine.
Here, work over here.

276
00:10:27,065 --> 00:10:29,467
Go ahead, start
filling these out.

277
00:10:35,873 --> 00:10:36,873
Hello?

278
00:10:37,174 --> 00:10:38,275
Thanks a lot.

279
00:10:39,276 --> 00:10:40,243
Excuse me.

280
00:10:40,244 --> 00:10:41,711
This is <i>my</i> office.

281
00:10:41,712 --> 00:10:43,779
Then I guess you can do
whatever you want, can't you?

282
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,014
I...

283
00:10:45,015 --> 00:10:46,582
May I help you?

284
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:48,218
Not anymore.

285
00:10:48,219 --> 00:10:50,386
Next time you need help
with IT, call me.

286
00:10:50,387 --> 00:10:52,521
You don't just do it
on your own.

287
00:10:52,522 --> 00:10:54,357
Look at this. Look.

288
00:10:54,358 --> 00:10:55,958
What did you do?

289
00:10:55,959 --> 00:10:57,459
What did <i>I</i> do?

290
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:59,361
What did I...? Okay.

291
00:10:59,362 --> 00:11:01,363
It's your cloud, lady.

292
00:11:01,364 --> 00:11:03,565
Go live on it.

293
00:11:04,934 --> 00:11:06,935
Right there. Her. Closer.

294
00:11:07,436 --> 00:11:09,371
Hey, do you know how
I get to the zoo?

295
00:11:10,773 --> 00:11:13,474
So you just troll along the
lakefront looking for ex-wives?

296
00:11:13,475 --> 00:11:14,708
No, just you.

297
00:11:14,709 --> 00:11:16,777
Your office
told me you'd be here.

298
00:11:16,778 --> 00:11:18,212
So...

299
00:11:18,213 --> 00:11:20,381
Wow, you're really slowing down,
aren't you?

300
00:11:22,784 --> 00:11:24,919
I'll just be a minute.

301
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,321
How's the presidential
campaign going?

302
00:11:28,322 --> 00:11:29,923
Why? What did you hear?

303
00:11:29,924 --> 00:11:31,724
Oh, God, you're paranoid.

304
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:33,960
No, I'm a vegetarian.

305
00:11:34,461 --> 00:11:35,328
Since when?

306
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:36,696
Since we divorced.

307
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:38,265
What do you need?

308
00:11:39,266 --> 00:11:41,734
Who do you know at State?

309
00:11:41,735 --> 00:11:43,735
A lot of people.

310
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:45,104
It's a Taiwan issue.

311
00:11:45,105 --> 00:11:48,207
A poor, innocent kid's
been accused of...

312
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,975
something or other,

313
00:11:49,976 --> 00:11:51,576
and they won't grant him
diplomatic immunity.

314
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:53,879
Do you want me to talk
to Doug Rothstein?

315
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,283
Yeah. Really?

316
00:11:57,284 --> 00:11:59,884
That'd be great.

317
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,687
You're-you're looking
good, Vanessa.

318
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:06,424
Eli?

319
00:12:07,526 --> 00:12:09,760
Your turn.

320
00:12:12,997 --> 00:12:14,698
Do you know Kim Kesler?

321
00:12:14,699 --> 00:12:17,133
Kim... Kesler?
Who's she?

322
00:12:17,134 --> 00:12:19,069
He. A political op
out of California.

323
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:20,438
I thought you guys
were all staffed up.

324
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:22,372
- It's not for the president.
- Who then?

325
00:12:22,373 --> 00:12:24,141
Me.

326
00:12:26,777 --> 00:12:28,778
Seriously, Vanessa?

327
00:12:30,048 --> 00:12:32,381
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

328
00:12:32,382 --> 00:12:33,849
He-He approached me.

329
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:35,151
State Senate.

330
00:12:35,152 --> 00:12:37,719
Oh, my God, you have
that wild look in your eye.

331
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,488
Rahm gets in,
and everybody thinks they can.

332
00:12:39,489 --> 00:12:41,290
It's a good time
for a woman.

333
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:42,959
Is that what
Kim Kesler told you--

334
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,126
the man with a woman's name?

335
00:12:44,127 --> 00:12:46,595
I need your help, Eli--
your professional opinion.

336
00:12:46,596 --> 00:12:47,996
Meet us for dinner tonight.

337
00:12:47,997 --> 00:12:49,630
Kim Kesler.
Kick his tires.

338
00:12:50,131 --> 00:12:52,800
See if he's real, or if he's
selling me a bill of goods.

339
00:12:52,801 --> 00:12:54,669
I can't believe
you're considering this.

340
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:56,737
I want to do
something with my life.

341
00:12:56,738 --> 00:12:58,340
You always used to say that.

342
00:12:58,341 --> 00:13:00,508
Well, now I mean it.

343
00:13:03,211 --> 00:13:04,744
We're not having a moment.

344
00:13:04,745 --> 00:13:05,780
No, no, we're not.

345
00:13:05,781 --> 00:13:07,781
I'm-I'm going, I'm going.

346
00:13:10,212 --> 00:13:12,313
Mrs. Florrick,
can I show you something?

347
00:13:12,314 --> 00:13:14,248
What is it, Caitlin?
I'm a little busy.

348
00:13:14,249 --> 00:13:15,615
It's probably
nothing, but I think

349
00:13:15,616 --> 00:13:17,317
I have something on
the consensual. Chen.

350
00:13:17,818 --> 00:13:19,686
We have to prove that he made
out with her consensually.

351
00:13:19,687 --> 00:13:21,421
Oh. Sure.

352
00:13:21,422 --> 00:13:23,723
Okay, so I was looking

353
00:13:23,724 --> 00:13:27,427
at AfterDeathSpace for
Maya, the dead girl.

354
00:13:27,428 --> 00:13:29,195
Oh, AfterDeathSpace.

355
00:13:29,196 --> 00:13:31,029
You know, when
someone dies,

356
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:33,799
and everybody wants to
share stories and photos.

357
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,166
Okay.

358
00:13:35,167 --> 00:13:36,502
And what was cool is,

359
00:13:36,503 --> 00:13:39,638
everybody at the booze
cruise was tweeting photos.

360
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:40,873
And so look.

361
00:13:40,874 --> 00:13:43,275
But what was even more cool
is... look.

362
00:13:43,276 --> 00:13:45,410
The color of her cup-- red.

363
00:13:45,411 --> 00:13:46,944
Okay.

364
00:13:46,945 --> 00:13:48,245
It's a stoplight party,
not a spectrum party.

365
00:13:48,246 --> 00:13:49,881
- A...?
- A stoplight party.

366
00:13:49,882 --> 00:13:52,950
Oh, you carry a red cup
to say you're in a relationship,

367
00:13:52,951 --> 00:13:54,786
a yellow cup
to say you're choosy,

368
00:13:54,787 --> 00:13:57,087
and a green cup to
say you're open.

369
00:13:59,356 --> 00:14:01,058
But see?

370
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:02,992
This one's from later--

371
00:14:03,393 --> 00:14:04,994
an hour after the first pic.

372
00:14:05,395 --> 00:14:07,564
And look at her cup.
Now it's green.

373
00:14:07,565 --> 00:14:09,165
Well, maybe it's a mistake.

374
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:10,767
Take my word for it.

375
00:14:10,768 --> 00:14:12,235
You know what cup
you're carrying

376
00:14:12,236 --> 00:14:13,637
at a stoplight party.

377
00:14:14,638 --> 00:14:18,340
So what made her switch
from a red cup to a green one?

378
00:14:18,341 --> 00:14:20,443
Yeah, got it. Red to green.

379
00:14:20,444 --> 00:14:23,278
Okay, listen,
I'll call you back.

380
00:14:24,981 --> 00:14:26,381
- Hi.
- Hey.

381
00:14:26,382 --> 00:14:28,183
So you're not
with the police?

382
00:14:28,184 --> 00:14:30,218
No. You're Maya's
boyfriend, right?

383
00:14:30,219 --> 00:14:32,955
Yeah. I was.

384
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:35,189
I already talked to the cops.
I wasn't there.

385
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:36,558
But you were on the phone
with her, right?

386
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:38,059
At the booze cruise.
She called you from it

387
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:39,260
the night she died.

388
00:14:39,261 --> 00:14:40,462
So?

389
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:42,897
- Well, you broke up with
her on the phone. - No.

390
00:14:42,898 --> 00:14:44,566
Listen, you're safe from arrest.

391
00:14:44,567 --> 00:14:45,900
Just tell me the truth.

392
00:14:45,901 --> 00:14:47,168
I am.

393
00:14:47,169 --> 00:14:48,536
She broke up with me.

394
00:14:49,037 --> 00:14:49,937
She said she
was tired of me

395
00:14:49,938 --> 00:14:51,404
spending all my time
with this waitress

396
00:14:51,405 --> 00:14:53,941
I know from Ra Sushi, but
she was this mother of three,

397
00:14:53,942 --> 00:14:56,909
really nice, and I just like
talking to her, you know?

398
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:58,846
- Sure. Um... - And she wanted to
be a philosophy major, too,

399
00:14:58,847 --> 00:15:00,347
back when she
was in college.

400
00:15:00,348 --> 00:15:01,448
It's not like I'm a
philosophy major yet.

401
00:15:01,449 --> 00:15:03,149
I'm still undecided
about my major.

402
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:04,718
Sure, look, don't worry about that.
I just like talking to her.

403
00:15:04,719 --> 00:15:06,652
But you talked to her?

404
00:15:06,653 --> 00:15:09,254
- Who, the waitress?
- No. Maya.

405
00:15:09,255 --> 00:15:12,157
When she broke up with you,
you talked to her, right?

406
00:15:12,158 --> 00:15:13,258
Yeah, yeah.

407
00:15:13,259 --> 00:15:14,861
I mean, no, no.
She, um...

408
00:15:14,862 --> 00:15:17,029
She left me
a voice mail.

409
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:18,430
Do you have it?

410
00:15:18,431 --> 00:15:20,332
You are so full of yourself.

411
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:22,400
You think
I can't do any guy here?

412
00:15:22,401 --> 00:15:24,035
Can you e-mail me
that voice mail?

413
00:15:24,036 --> 00:15:25,336
Yeah, sure.
Does it help?

414
00:15:25,337 --> 00:15:26,671
Yeah, it does.

415
00:15:26,672 --> 00:15:28,139
There's more if you want.

416
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:30,375
Your phone just
keeps cutting me off.

417
00:15:30,376 --> 00:15:31,810
I just want... Hey!

418
00:15:31,811 --> 00:15:33,378
I said, don't touch me.

419
00:15:33,379 --> 00:15:34,946
What? I'm not touching you.

420
00:15:36,549 --> 00:15:37,815
What's wrong?

421
00:15:37,816 --> 00:15:39,016
Nothing.

422
00:15:39,017 --> 00:15:40,885
Did you play that
for anyone else?

423
00:15:40,886 --> 00:15:42,953
- Yeah.
- Who?

424
00:15:42,954 --> 00:15:44,755
Hey! I said, don't touch me.

425
00:15:44,756 --> 00:15:46,289
What? I'm not touching you.

426
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:47,391
That's Chen.

427
00:15:47,392 --> 00:15:49,493
Sounds like
unwanted attention to me.

428
00:15:49,494 --> 00:15:50,828
There goes consensual for them.

429
00:15:50,829 --> 00:15:52,563
We should make an offer.

430
00:15:52,564 --> 00:15:54,296
Life? No chance of parole?

431
00:15:54,297 --> 00:15:55,532
Hey, Cary.

432
00:15:55,533 --> 00:15:57,066
Sorry to interrupt.

433
00:15:57,567 --> 00:15:59,201
We're gonna be shuffling
the offices around a bit,

434
00:15:59,202 --> 00:16:00,870
so if you could get your stuff

435
00:16:00,871 --> 00:16:03,339
together and be ready
in the next few days, okay?

436
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:04,607
Uh, this is from Peter?

437
00:16:04,608 --> 00:16:07,109
Yup, he delegated to me.

438
00:16:08,712 --> 00:16:09,711
What's going on there?

439
00:16:09,712 --> 00:16:12,447
It's a guy thing.
Office jockeying.

440
00:16:12,448 --> 00:16:15,216
I don't think they can put you
in any smaller of an office.

441
00:16:15,217 --> 00:16:17,118
Oh, they can.

442
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,760
Hello.

443
00:16:27,261 --> 00:16:29,096
Oh, my mom's just downstairs.

444
00:16:32,934 --> 00:16:34,101
You're Zach, right?

445
00:16:35,804 --> 00:16:37,738
I'm Will Gardner,
your mom's boss.

446
00:16:38,739 --> 00:16:39,740
Oh.

447
00:16:40,241 --> 00:16:41,408
Hey.

448
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:47,179
So, no school today, huh?

449
00:16:48,615 --> 00:16:49,983
No, there was.

450
00:16:52,653 --> 00:16:54,888
Oh, it's 4:00.

451
00:16:58,758 --> 00:17:01,326
Helping Mom out?

452
00:17:01,861 --> 00:17:04,062
Yeah.

453
00:17:07,967 --> 00:17:09,968
Well...

454
00:17:09,969 --> 00:17:12,104
keep on keepin' on.

455
00:17:20,346 --> 00:17:22,847
You should know something
about your friend, Cary.

456
00:17:23,448 --> 00:17:24,349
My friend, Cary?

457
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:25,418
Yeah, you should know something.

458
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:28,420
He has a thing
for ethnic women.

459
00:17:28,421 --> 00:17:30,021
Oh. Really?

460
00:17:30,022 --> 00:17:31,388
Yeah, it's pretty obvious.

461
00:17:31,689 --> 00:17:34,224
Every black or Hispanic woman
through here.

462
00:17:35,025 --> 00:17:38,595
Wow. Well, thank you
for the warning.

463
00:17:47,204 --> 00:17:48,370
Got it working.

464
00:17:48,371 --> 00:17:49,805
You did not.

465
00:17:49,806 --> 00:17:52,575
I did. The IT guy put on
proprietary software,

466
00:17:52,576 --> 00:17:55,611
so he could charge your firm
for every megabyte he stored.

467
00:17:55,612 --> 00:17:58,247
That's why it rejected the
transferring of your files.

468
00:17:58,248 --> 00:17:59,582
What? I don't understand.

469
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:00,983
It's really corrupt.

470
00:18:00,984 --> 00:18:03,452
You don't need
to be paying to store files.

471
00:18:03,453 --> 00:18:04,820
In fact, it slows
the system down.

472
00:18:04,821 --> 00:18:07,055
- Really?
- Yeah.

473
00:18:07,056 --> 00:18:08,957
Oh, your boss was in here. Will.

474
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:12,126
Yes, I-I saw.

475
00:18:12,627 --> 00:18:14,128
Did you say hi?

476
00:18:14,129 --> 00:18:15,864
I did.

477
00:18:18,667 --> 00:18:20,634
All right, I better go.

478
00:18:20,635 --> 00:18:22,336
Okay. I love you.

479
00:18:22,337 --> 00:18:23,439
Love you, too.

480
00:18:29,944 --> 00:18:32,446
Yeah?

481
00:18:33,814 --> 00:18:35,948
I want a car.

482
00:18:38,518 --> 00:18:39,886
<i>It's like</i> Moneyball.

483
00:18:39,887 --> 00:18:42,255
Politics doesn't have
to be for the rich.

484
00:18:42,256 --> 00:18:46,359
It's the true democratization
of power in this country.

485
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,294
You have citizen
engagement on one hand.

486
00:18:48,295 --> 00:18:49,596
Megatrend, right?

487
00:18:49,597 --> 00:18:51,663
I mean, everybody's
talking about it.

488
00:18:51,664 --> 00:18:53,432
Mark Penn, so on,

489
00:18:53,433 --> 00:18:55,868
and I'm not even
talking about RTR.

490
00:18:55,869 --> 00:18:58,169
I mean, talk about
real <i>Moneyball.</i>

491
00:18:58,170 --> 00:18:59,505
RTR?

492
00:18:59,506 --> 00:19:01,473
Oh. Jeez.
Real-Time Response.

493
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:05,176
They hit Vanessa,
and bam, we hit back. Bam!

494
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:07,978
We hit back.

495
00:19:07,979 --> 00:19:09,881
Through?

496
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:12,182
Micro-pockets
of committed,

497
00:19:12,183 --> 00:19:15,085
citizen, online
journalist bloggers.

498
00:19:15,086 --> 00:19:17,522
Each talking from a subset
of their own communities.

499
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:20,024
Let's say we have upstate
agricultural sections, right?

500
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:21,826
We also have the
urban cities, right?

501
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,192
We have activated
in there...

502
00:19:23,193 --> 00:19:24,828
Well, that went well.

503
00:19:26,263 --> 00:19:27,497
You're not going with him.

504
00:19:27,498 --> 00:19:29,032
This was all a joke, right?

505
00:19:29,033 --> 00:19:31,067
He was trying to impress you.

506
00:19:31,068 --> 00:19:33,503
Oh, my God, Vanessa,
he is a clown.

507
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,041
Then help me.

508
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:41,076
You were never going with him?

509
00:19:41,077 --> 00:19:42,645
Are you kidding?

510
00:19:42,646 --> 00:19:44,147
Citizen engagement, RTR.

511
00:19:44,148 --> 00:19:45,614
He just gave me the bug.

512
00:19:45,615 --> 00:19:49,218
So this was all so I
would agree to help you?

513
00:19:49,219 --> 00:19:52,154
I'm not going to be your
campaign manager, Vanessa.

514
00:19:52,155 --> 00:19:53,923
I know.

515
00:19:53,924 --> 00:19:57,023
Just get me started.
Do some polling.

516
00:19:57,024 --> 00:19:58,593
See if there's any interest,
that's all.

517
00:19:58,594 --> 00:20:01,362
- See if I have the stomach for this.
- You don't.

518
00:20:01,363 --> 00:20:03,331
Well, then, it'll be over fast.

519
00:20:08,703 --> 00:20:10,404
So, what happened with
the State Department?

520
00:20:10,405 --> 00:20:12,173
Oh, yeah, good news.

521
00:20:22,917 --> 00:20:24,918
Hello?

522
00:20:24,919 --> 00:20:26,686
The State Department
screwed you.

523
00:20:26,687 --> 00:20:28,287
They're pushing
for Chen's release.

524
00:20:28,288 --> 00:20:30,322
They don't want
to isolate Taiwan.

525
00:20:30,323 --> 00:20:32,391
There's a hearing tomorrow.

526
00:20:32,392 --> 00:20:34,326
Damn it.
He's guilty.

527
00:20:35,127 --> 00:20:36,261
We just... We just
got this voice mail.

528
00:20:36,262 --> 00:20:37,463
It's a slam dunk.

529
00:20:37,464 --> 00:20:39,832
Yeah. Too bad.

530
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:42,567
Good, you got
your stuff together.

531
00:20:42,568 --> 00:20:45,203
I have another office
for you down the hall.

532
00:20:56,113 --> 00:20:57,346
<i>I extend my sincere gratitude</i>

533
00:20:57,347 --> 00:20:58,882
to each and every one of you

534
00:20:58,883 --> 00:21:00,016
for being here tonight.

535
00:21:03,987 --> 00:21:05,420
So he doesn't expect me?

536
00:21:05,421 --> 00:21:08,190
No, but he's cool--
an old family friend.

537
00:21:08,191 --> 00:21:10,125
Just don't get
rambly on him.

538
00:21:10,126 --> 00:21:11,726
Uncle Dan.

539
00:21:11,727 --> 00:21:12,961
- Hey,   - Dana.
- How you doing?

540
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:16,076
Look at you.

541
00:21:16,265 --> 00:21:17,565
Dad told me you
were in town.

542
00:21:17,566 --> 00:21:19,867
You've, uh,
caught me playing hooky.

543
00:21:19,868 --> 00:21:22,636
The same stump speech
the 18th time,

544
00:21:22,637 --> 00:21:24,038
and you're allowed
a little leeway.

545
00:21:24,039 --> 00:21:25,039
Know what I mean?

546
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,840
Oh, this is,
this is Cary.

547
00:21:26,841 --> 00:21:28,575
Uh, nice to meet you, sir.

548
00:21:28,576 --> 00:21:30,677
Oh, ignore him-- he
calls everybody sir.

549
00:21:30,678 --> 00:21:31,945
It's the straight,
suburban thing.

550
00:21:31,946 --> 00:21:33,047
Uh-huh.

551
00:21:33,048 --> 00:21:35,482
Uncle Daniel works
in the Obama State Department.

552
00:21:35,483 --> 00:21:37,851
Well, that sounds
deathly formal.

553
00:21:37,852 --> 00:21:40,921
So it's true--
you did break up with Jimi?

554
00:21:44,024 --> 00:21:45,291
No, we're just...

555
00:21:46,327 --> 00:21:47,661
It's complicated.

556
00:21:48,162 --> 00:21:49,162
Uh-huh.

557
00:21:49,163 --> 00:21:50,663
Anyway, Cary and
I work together

558
00:21:50,664 --> 00:21:52,131
- at the state's attorney's office.
- Oh, yeah,

559
00:21:52,132 --> 00:21:53,032
Peter-- how's he doing?

560
00:21:53,033 --> 00:21:54,700
We worked together
a long time ago.

561
00:21:54,701 --> 00:21:55,902
Good,
he's good,

562
00:21:55,903 --> 00:21:57,236
he's good, but we're
working on a case

563
00:21:57,237 --> 00:21:58,404
involving the
One China rule.

564
00:21:58,405 --> 00:22:00,239
Really?

565
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,174
Well, that I have
to hear all about.

566
00:22:03,777 --> 00:22:05,411
Good job.

567
00:22:05,412 --> 00:22:06,978
Ah, thanks,
not too rambly?

568
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:10,349
Surprisingly not.

569
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:15,253
So Matan says that you have
a thing for ethnic women.

570
00:22:15,754 --> 00:22:16,487
He what?

571
00:22:16,988 --> 00:22:19,558
He says you have a
thing for ethnic women.

572
00:22:19,559 --> 00:22:21,092
You just can't control
yourself around us.

573
00:22:21,093 --> 00:22:25,228
Oh, I...
that's not true.

574
00:22:27,398 --> 00:22:29,567
Unless that's
a good thing.

575
00:22:31,369 --> 00:22:33,070
That depends.

576
00:22:35,707 --> 00:22:37,908
On...?

577
00:22:55,757 --> 00:22:56,557
<i>I want you to vet</i>

578
00:22:56,558 --> 00:22:57,859
my ex-wife.

579
00:23:01,329 --> 00:23:02,564
- Really?
- Yeah, I know

580
00:23:02,565 --> 00:23:04,666
it sounds a bit weird, but
she's thinking of running

581
00:23:04,667 --> 00:23:06,602
for state senate and
she wants me to vet her.

582
00:23:06,603 --> 00:23:08,737
All right, well,
I have to do some work

583
00:23:08,738 --> 00:23:11,138
on Taiwan first,
but then, sure.

584
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:13,107
How, how thorough
should I be?

585
00:23:13,108 --> 00:23:14,742
As thorough
as her enemies would be.

586
00:23:15,743 --> 00:23:16,944
Okay.

587
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,950
Um... this isn't
about something else?

588
00:23:23,451 --> 00:23:25,152
You mean, am I jealous
of my wife

589
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:26,620
and want to see
who she's sleeping with?

590
00:23:26,621 --> 00:23:28,054
No.

591
00:23:28,055 --> 00:23:29,856
Okay.

592
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,028
Oh, come on!

593
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:38,397
So this is a hearing
into the status

594
00:23:38,398 --> 00:23:41,001
of Mr. Jin-Pyn's
diplomatic...

595
00:23:42,002 --> 00:23:42,935
status.

596
00:23:42,936 --> 00:23:43,936
Don't worry, Chen,

597
00:23:43,937 --> 00:23:46,038
you have the backing
of the state department.

598
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:47,805
Thank you.

599
00:23:47,806 --> 00:23:50,876
I can't spend
another day in here.

600
00:23:50,877 --> 00:23:53,912
I don't know, they're smiling
like they know something.

601
00:23:53,913 --> 00:23:55,614
Now let's begin.

602
00:23:55,615 --> 00:23:57,716
I understand the
defense has a witness.

603
00:23:57,717 --> 00:24:01,352
Yes, Your Honor, it is our
contention that protections

604
00:24:01,353 --> 00:24:04,088
of diplomatic immunity
were denied our client

605
00:24:04,089 --> 00:24:06,390
due to the peculiarities
of Taiwan.

606
00:24:06,391 --> 00:24:09,293
To that end,
we have asked a spokes...

607
00:24:11,196 --> 00:24:13,597
Ma'am, there's a call
from the state department.

608
00:24:13,598 --> 00:24:15,699
A Mr. Daniel Golden would like
to speak with you.

609
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:18,935
...a spokeswoman
at the state department...

610
00:24:18,936 --> 00:24:20,904
Yes, Counselor?

611
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,175
Excuse me, Your Honor,
if we could delay...

612
00:24:25,176 --> 00:24:26,677
As long as you want, Counselor.

613
00:24:32,615 --> 00:24:36,152
Um, actually, Your Honor, we ask
the court that reasonable bail

614
00:24:36,153 --> 00:24:37,219
be set,

615
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:38,854
and we would have
no objection to make

616
00:24:38,855 --> 00:24:41,057
home confinement
a condition.

617
00:24:44,293 --> 00:24:45,260
What happened?

618
00:24:45,261 --> 00:24:46,428
State worried

619
00:24:46,429 --> 00:24:48,496
that extending
diplomatic immunity to the kid

620
00:24:48,497 --> 00:24:50,464
would be a slap
in the face to China.

621
00:24:54,236 --> 00:24:56,971
Okay, we have
to get discovery.

622
00:24:57,972 --> 00:25:00,141
None of your hair was
found on the body, Chen,

623
00:25:00,142 --> 00:25:02,776
but we did just get
the lab report back

624
00:25:02,777 --> 00:25:04,178
on the trace evidence.

625
00:25:04,179 --> 00:25:06,646
There was a blond hair--
not Maya's, a man's--

626
00:25:06,647 --> 00:25:07,681
on her collar.

627
00:25:07,682 --> 00:25:08,782
They don't know
who it matches.

628
00:25:08,783 --> 00:25:09,717
Anders.

629
00:25:09,718 --> 00:25:10,918
That's what
we think,

630
00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:12,753
but the police didn't
do his suspect exam,

631
00:25:12,754 --> 00:25:14,454
so we have nothing
to match it to.

632
00:25:14,455 --> 00:25:15,589
Do you have anything of his?

633
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:18,491
Anything that might have
one of his hairs on it--

634
00:25:18,492 --> 00:25:20,292
a brush or an item of clothing?

635
00:25:20,793 --> 00:25:23,395
I know his gym locker
combination at school.

636
00:25:24,396 --> 00:25:25,264
<i>My brother left</i>

637
00:25:25,265 --> 00:25:26,632
all my things
in his locker.

638
00:25:26,633 --> 00:25:28,634
He gave me
the combination.

639
00:25:28,635 --> 00:25:30,236
I'll be right in and out.

640
00:25:31,638 --> 00:25:33,339
Thanks.

641
00:26:04,735 --> 00:26:06,970
<i>It's the other</i>
<i>seasickness band, Cary.</i>

642
00:26:06,971 --> 00:26:09,005
How do I know you didn't
plant it there, Kalinda?

643
00:26:09,006 --> 00:26:10,406
Because I didn't.

644
00:26:10,407 --> 00:26:11,875
Uh-huh, and you just
happened to know

645
00:26:11,876 --> 00:26:13,109
the number
of Anders' locker?

646
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:15,245
No, I just happen to be
a very good investigator.

647
00:26:15,246 --> 00:26:16,780
Look, check
if you don't believe me.

648
00:26:16,781 --> 00:26:18,114
I'll get back to you.

649
00:26:18,115 --> 00:26:19,215
Okay, whatever.

650
00:26:20,216 --> 00:26:22,718
We're all having
to make sacrifices,

651
00:26:22,719 --> 00:26:24,753
but you have a
window now at least.

652
00:26:25,454 --> 00:26:26,155
That one.

653
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:29,291
The cubicle
in the middle.

654
00:26:30,792 --> 00:26:31,794
Thanks.

655
00:26:33,263 --> 00:26:35,130
You're welcome.

656
00:26:35,131 --> 00:26:37,099
Hi, uh, sorry
to keep you waiting.

657
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,900
No problem, I
keep myself busy.

658
00:26:39,601 --> 00:26:40,734
You have a
pretty office.

659
00:26:40,735 --> 00:26:42,103
Thank you.

660
00:26:42,104 --> 00:26:44,071
Start of a campaign,
you work in Versailles.

661
00:26:44,072 --> 00:26:45,840
By the end, you're in Motel 6--

662
00:26:45,841 --> 00:26:47,541
not to disparage
Motel 6.

663
00:26:47,542 --> 00:26:49,376
I'm a politician now.

664
00:26:50,212 --> 00:26:53,881
So, uh, you, uh, married once

665
00:26:53,882 --> 00:26:55,081
to Mr. Gold?

666
00:26:55,082 --> 00:26:58,318
Four happy years, eight
medium ones, and two bad ones.

667
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,888
- I hope that doesn't preclude
me from running. - Actually,

668
00:27:01,889 --> 00:27:04,891
I'm not here to make judgment,
just, just questions.

669
00:27:04,892 --> 00:27:06,526
So why did you guys break up?

670
00:27:06,527 --> 00:27:08,494
Uh, I think that was
in the divorce settlement.

671
00:27:08,495 --> 00:27:11,463
Actually, it wasn't, just
"irreconcilable differences."

672
00:27:11,464 --> 00:27:13,132
Ah, well, that's what it was.

673
00:27:13,633 --> 00:27:16,302
Yeah, but I think
we'll need to go deeper.

674
00:27:22,742 --> 00:27:26,745
Okay, uh, we were both
working too hard.

675
00:27:26,746 --> 00:27:29,780
I was having to take a lot
of trips out of town.

676
00:27:29,781 --> 00:27:32,350
Yeah, uh, Dubai,
three trips.

677
00:27:32,951 --> 00:27:33,651
Yes.

678
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,920
At that time, I was doing
PR for an oil company.

679
00:27:35,921 --> 00:27:37,322
And who did you
meet there?

680
00:27:37,323 --> 00:27:38,289
Who did I meet?

681
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:40,391
I-- do you want
an itemized list?

682
00:27:40,392 --> 00:27:42,793
Yeah.

683
00:27:42,794 --> 00:27:43,994
Just write
down the ones

684
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:45,695
that you remember.

685
00:27:46,696 --> 00:27:48,665
Are you looking
for anyone in particular?

686
00:27:49,166 --> 00:27:52,836
Yeah, uh, Omar Tate.

687
00:27:55,405 --> 00:27:57,207
You're doing
his dirty work for him,

688
00:27:57,208 --> 00:27:59,141
aren't you?

689
00:27:59,142 --> 00:28:00,209
Eli's dirty work.

690
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:01,410
- No.
- He told you

691
00:28:01,411 --> 00:28:02,444
to ask me that.

692
00:28:02,445 --> 00:28:06,249
No, my vetting is
independent of Mr. Gold.

693
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:07,750
- I don't believe you.
- I understand that,

694
00:28:07,751 --> 00:28:09,551
but it's true.

695
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:16,424
It was a mistake,
Omar was a mistake.

696
00:28:18,526 --> 00:28:20,160
Uh, how many times
did you meet?

697
00:28:20,161 --> 00:28:20,795
Don't tell him.

698
00:28:24,031 --> 00:28:24,900
I was young.

699
00:28:24,901 --> 00:28:26,701
This is, this is merely
part of the vetting.

700
00:28:26,702 --> 00:28:28,104
Don't tell him.

701
00:28:30,405 --> 00:28:31,372
Please.

702
00:28:40,266 --> 00:28:41,533
Yeah, I was
on the booze cruise, too,

703
00:28:41,534 --> 00:28:43,635
but I just remember seeing
Maya by the bar.

704
00:28:44,136 --> 00:28:45,803
Did you see her with this man?

705
00:28:46,804 --> 00:28:47,838
No.

706
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:49,774
I mean, I saw him
in the newspaper,

707
00:28:49,775 --> 00:28:52,176
but I didn't see
them leave together.

708
00:28:52,677 --> 00:28:53,644
I mean, we were
both worried

709
00:28:53,645 --> 00:28:55,412
about getting
disconnected at parties,

710
00:28:55,413 --> 00:28:57,148
so we always
kept track.

711
00:28:57,149 --> 00:28:59,449
How did you keep track?

712
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:01,418
Oh, you know,
that app.

713
00:29:01,819 --> 00:29:02,418
What app?

714
00:29:02,819 --> 00:29:03,853
The rape app?

715
00:29:05,154 --> 00:29:07,490
Have you heard
of it?

716
00:29:07,791 --> 00:29:09,159
No, show me.

717
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:11,661
We both had it installed
on our phones

718
00:29:11,662 --> 00:29:13,429
so we could keep track
of each other.

719
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:16,732
See, the GPS shows you
where your friend is.

720
00:29:20,636 --> 00:29:22,770
There's a panic button.

721
00:29:22,771 --> 00:29:24,239
Yeah, I know.

722
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,840
That's what sucks.

723
00:29:26,341 --> 00:29:28,276
The phone vibrated
when Maya pushed it,

724
00:29:28,277 --> 00:29:32,147
but the music was so loud
and I was dancing,

725
00:29:32,148 --> 00:29:33,815
so I didn't feel it.

726
00:29:33,816 --> 00:29:35,416
What?

727
00:29:35,417 --> 00:29:38,886
It has a history of when
Maya pushed the panic button.

728
00:29:39,387 --> 00:29:42,490
Yeah, I know, but it
didn't show her location.

729
00:29:42,791 --> 00:29:45,859
I know, but it shows what time
she pressed the button.

730
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:48,996
11:33.

731
00:29:48,997 --> 00:29:50,796
Yeah, I do see it.

732
00:29:50,797 --> 00:29:52,732
11:34 p.m.

733
00:29:52,733 --> 00:29:55,535
Chen bought a mojito
at 11:34 p.m.

734
00:29:55,536 --> 00:29:57,703
Why does that matter?

735
00:29:58,404 --> 00:29:59,739
A rape app?

736
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:03,076
No, I've never heard
of that.

737
00:30:03,077 --> 00:30:04,577
Okay,

738
00:30:04,578 --> 00:30:05,912
well, if that's
probative,

739
00:30:05,913 --> 00:30:06,979
then the state's
attorney's office

740
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:09,014
will question her, yep.

741
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:11,083
Ha-- no, no,
I think

742
00:30:11,084 --> 00:30:13,152
it's a bit too early
to talk about release.

743
00:30:13,153 --> 00:30:14,253
Yeah, okay,
thank you, bye.

744
00:30:14,254 --> 00:30:15,521
What was that?

745
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:16,721
The defense attorneys.

746
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:19,824
They say they have
the time of death

747
00:30:19,825 --> 00:30:21,126
via a friend
who received

748
00:30:21,127 --> 00:30:23,928
a signal Maya sent on
something called a rape app.

749
00:30:23,929 --> 00:30:25,029
Do you believe them?

750
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:27,165
I don't know.

751
00:30:30,367 --> 00:30:31,302
Nice office.

752
00:30:32,803 --> 00:30:33,837
Thanks.

753
00:30:33,838 --> 00:30:36,107
I get a lot more air here.

754
00:30:48,386 --> 00:30:50,753
Chen did it, he did it.

755
00:30:50,754 --> 00:30:51,921
How do you know?

756
00:30:51,922 --> 00:30:53,690
He's Taiwanese-- he would sign

757
00:30:53,691 --> 00:30:56,592
his surname first.

758
00:31:01,064 --> 00:31:03,832
Hey, Dick.

759
00:31:03,833 --> 00:31:05,301
How's it going?

760
00:31:05,302 --> 00:31:07,203
I hear you stopped going
to your anthropology class.

761
00:31:07,204 --> 00:31:08,770
Listen, I don't have
to talk to you.

762
00:31:08,771 --> 00:31:10,538
Actually, you do because
you stopped going

763
00:31:10,539 --> 00:31:11,939
to your anthropology class.

764
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,975
What, what are you
talking about?

765
00:31:13,976 --> 00:31:15,510
You haven't been
in six weeks.

766
00:31:15,511 --> 00:31:16,978
Registrar officially
dropped you from the class,

767
00:31:16,979 --> 00:31:18,646
so you're only taking
eight hours now.

768
00:31:18,647 --> 00:31:20,381
Yeah, so, so what?

769
00:31:20,382 --> 00:31:22,917
So diplomatic immunity applies
to diplomats' children

770
00:31:22,918 --> 00:31:24,085
up to the age of 23,

771
00:31:24,086 --> 00:31:26,386
provided they are
full-time students.

772
00:31:26,387 --> 00:31:28,589
You aren't anymore.

773
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:31,225
I can bring charges against
you any time I want.

774
00:31:31,626 --> 00:31:32,926
I didn't do it.

775
00:31:32,927 --> 00:31:34,961
I believe you, but I think
you know what happened,

776
00:31:34,962 --> 00:31:37,797
and I can make a case
that you were part of it.

777
00:31:37,798 --> 00:31:40,834
Chen grabbed her seasickness
band when he killed her.

778
00:31:40,835 --> 00:31:42,835
Didn't he? And then
he slipped it to you

779
00:31:42,836 --> 00:31:45,638
to hide it, right? Okay.

780
00:31:46,139 --> 00:31:48,007
That's your signature.

781
00:31:48,008 --> 00:31:49,908
You used his credit
card to buy a drink,

782
00:31:49,909 --> 00:31:51,577
and when you looked
up, Chen was gone.

783
00:31:52,078 --> 00:31:54,580
He followed Maya below
deck where he killed her.

784
00:31:55,581 --> 00:31:56,549
So...

785
00:31:57,050 --> 00:31:58,950
it's your choice.

786
00:31:59,451 --> 00:32:02,954
You want to be a witness
or an accomplice?

787
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:07,091
How much do you want me
to tell you?

788
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:09,594
Enough to know if
she should run or not.

789
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:11,530
She shouldn't run.

790
00:32:11,531 --> 00:32:12,897
Okay. Why?

791
00:32:12,898 --> 00:32:15,332
Well, she was
on the organizing board

792
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:16,900
for a fund-raiser
for Rod Blagojevich.

793
00:32:16,901 --> 00:32:18,169
Old news. What else?

794
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:20,404
She's had relationships.

795
00:32:21,005 --> 00:32:23,374
I figured. How many?

796
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:25,442
A few.

797
00:32:25,943 --> 00:32:27,444
But not slut level?

798
00:32:28,145 --> 00:32:29,112
No.

799
00:32:29,313 --> 00:32:31,347
Then we shouldn't
have a problem.

800
00:32:33,984 --> 00:32:37,153
Kalinda, we are doctors
discussing a patient.

801
00:32:37,754 --> 00:32:38,788
What?

802
00:32:39,289 --> 00:32:42,292
Well, one of them
in particular is problematic.

803
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:43,560
Omar Tate.

804
00:32:43,561 --> 00:32:45,495
He's a financier
of high-end resorts.

805
00:32:45,996 --> 00:32:46,828
What is it? Criminal past?

806
00:32:46,829 --> 00:32:47,963
No.

807
00:32:47,964 --> 00:32:49,764
No, he has a spotless record.

808
00:32:49,765 --> 00:32:51,700
Perfect credit, actually.

809
00:32:52,601 --> 00:32:54,803
Kalinda, you're being weird.

810
00:32:56,839 --> 00:32:58,907
Well, Omar Tate
isn't his birth name.

811
00:32:58,908 --> 00:33:00,842
It's Aarash...

812
00:33:01,343 --> 00:33:02,977
bin Laden.

813
00:33:06,013 --> 00:33:07,047
Come again?

814
00:33:07,648 --> 00:33:11,051
It's Aarash bin Laden,
Osama's second cousin.

815
00:33:15,123 --> 00:33:17,725
My ex-wife slept
with a bin Laden?

816
00:33:17,726 --> 00:33:18,858
Listen, for what it's worth,

817
00:33:18,859 --> 00:33:20,027
Aarash bin Laden
has never been linked

818
00:33:20,028 --> 00:33:21,962
to terrorist activity
of any kind.

819
00:33:21,963 --> 00:33:24,498
Oh, good. She banged
a nice bin Laden.

820
00:33:24,499 --> 00:33:26,933
Uh...

821
00:33:26,934 --> 00:33:28,301
This is absurd.

822
00:33:29,302 --> 00:33:30,337
When was this?

823
00:33:30,338 --> 00:33:32,071
And he has publicly denounced
the actions of al Qaeda.

824
00:33:32,072 --> 00:33:33,973
Wait. When was this?

825
00:33:33,974 --> 00:33:36,008
Uh, you know, I think
the details are in the file.

826
00:33:36,009 --> 00:33:37,543
Kalinda, when was this?

827
00:33:39,812 --> 00:33:41,413
2007.

828
00:33:48,655 --> 00:33:50,855
She was married to me.

829
00:33:53,357 --> 00:33:54,359
I'm sorry.

830
00:34:05,938 --> 00:34:08,906
20 years, and that's my last,
best and final.

831
00:34:09,407 --> 00:34:12,409
That leaves me
nowhere to go, Cary.

832
00:34:12,410 --> 00:34:13,709
Go to your client.

833
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:16,178
Well, how do you know
Dick's story is reliable?

834
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:18,147
Nah, I don't have to make
my case to you, Alicia.

835
00:34:18,148 --> 00:34:19,281
Take it or leave it.

836
00:34:19,282 --> 00:34:21,417
But know that
it has a 24-hour clock.

837
00:34:24,654 --> 00:34:27,122
Very impressive.

838
00:34:27,123 --> 00:34:28,824
You heading out?

839
00:34:28,825 --> 00:34:31,560
Yup. My last week here,
and I haven't been shot.

840
00:34:33,462 --> 00:34:35,596
The day's young yet.

841
00:34:37,299 --> 00:34:39,200
Do you think
Dick's telling the truth?

842
00:34:39,201 --> 00:34:41,336
I think he's afraid
of prosecution,

843
00:34:41,337 --> 00:34:42,904
so he'll say
whatever they want.

844
00:34:42,905 --> 00:34:45,474
But it also could
be the truth.

845
00:34:47,476 --> 00:34:48,909
Is that...?

846
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:51,846
That-That's him. Chen.

847
00:34:54,850 --> 00:34:57,050
Call him.

848
00:35:00,922 --> 00:35:01,889
Damn. It's Cary.

849
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:03,256
Hello?

850
00:35:03,257 --> 00:35:06,292
Alicia, our office
was notified your client

851
00:35:06,293 --> 00:35:08,327
just broke his electronic
perimeter. What's going on?

852
00:35:08,328 --> 00:35:09,529
I-I'm not sure.

853
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:11,731
Alicia, if you know
your client is attempting

854
00:35:11,732 --> 00:35:13,733
to flee the jurisdiction,
you have

855
00:35:13,734 --> 00:35:15,568
a legal obligation
to report that.

856
00:35:15,569 --> 00:35:17,269
I know my legal
obligations, Cary.

857
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:18,771
I have not been in touch
with my client.

858
00:35:18,772 --> 00:35:19,938
I will call him

859
00:35:19,939 --> 00:35:21,006
and get back to you.

860
00:35:21,007 --> 00:35:22,040
Alicia...

861
00:35:22,041 --> 00:35:23,108
Let me call him,

862
00:35:23,109 --> 00:35:24,209
and I'll get back to you.

863
00:35:32,218 --> 00:35:33,485
Wait. What are you doing?

864
00:35:33,486 --> 00:35:35,420
We're not going
to know where he is.

865
00:35:35,421 --> 00:35:38,789
I don't want to
know where he is.

866
00:35:41,593 --> 00:35:42,827
Alicia?

867
00:35:42,828 --> 00:35:44,294
I couldn't reach him.

868
00:35:45,295 --> 00:35:47,598
Tread carefully here, Alicia,
because if you know something,

869
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:49,634
you're facing obstruction
of justice,

870
00:35:49,635 --> 00:35:50,868
aiding and abetting...

871
00:35:50,869 --> 00:35:52,736
I have not spoken to my client.

872
00:35:52,737 --> 00:35:54,237
Do you know where he is?

873
00:35:54,238 --> 00:35:55,972
Not for certain.

874
00:35:55,973 --> 00:35:57,473
What <i>do</i> you know for certain?

875
00:35:57,974 --> 00:35:59,308
I witnessed an Audi

876
00:35:59,309 --> 00:36:01,344
with a driver
resembling my client

877
00:36:01,345 --> 00:36:03,547
headed westbound on 90.

878
00:36:03,548 --> 00:36:05,181
He's going to O'Hare.

879
00:36:05,882 --> 00:36:08,851
Again, I do not know that
for certain.

880
00:36:14,221 --> 00:36:15,590
I thought he was innocent.

881
00:36:15,591 --> 00:36:17,158
I know.

882
00:36:17,659 --> 00:36:19,493
Sometimes...

883
00:36:19,494 --> 00:36:22,163
the guilty ones look
like the innocent ones.

884
00:36:22,664 --> 00:36:25,799
Well, that's depressing.

885
00:36:39,981 --> 00:36:42,014
So, what did she tell you?

886
00:36:42,015 --> 00:36:44,349
I don't think you should run.

887
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:46,786
Why?

888
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:50,122
How... could you...

889
00:36:50,123 --> 00:36:52,892
fund-raise
for Rod Blagojevich?

890
00:36:54,661 --> 00:36:56,128
I know.

891
00:36:56,129 --> 00:36:57,729
- It's dumb, huh?
- Yeah.

892
00:36:57,730 --> 00:36:59,264
The voters don't know you.
That'll define you.

893
00:36:59,265 --> 00:37:01,066
You don't think
you could leak it,

894
00:37:01,067 --> 00:37:01,834
take the sting away?

895
00:37:01,835 --> 00:37:03,003
No.

896
00:37:06,004 --> 00:37:07,606
What else, Eli?

897
00:37:07,607 --> 00:37:08,541
Isn't that enough?

898
00:37:08,542 --> 00:37:10,176
No.

899
00:37:11,177 --> 00:37:13,077
She told you?

900
00:37:16,448 --> 00:37:18,716
I don't even know why I care.

901
00:37:20,085 --> 00:37:22,920
The thought that my semen mixed
with bin Laden's.

902
00:37:22,921 --> 00:37:24,723
Come on, Eli,
you know how this works.

903
00:37:24,724 --> 00:37:27,391
The semen doesn't
just stay in us.

904
00:37:27,392 --> 00:37:29,126
I thought we were happy in 2007.

905
00:37:29,127 --> 00:37:30,360
We were.

906
00:37:30,361 --> 00:37:32,061
It was a mistake.

907
00:37:32,062 --> 00:37:33,263
I loved you, Vanessa.

908
00:37:33,264 --> 00:37:34,531
We never talked.

909
00:37:34,532 --> 00:37:34,932
We talked.

910
00:37:34,933 --> 00:37:36,934
About work.

911
00:37:36,935 --> 00:37:38,235
About politics.

912
00:37:38,236 --> 00:37:41,538
My mother died, and...

913
00:37:42,039 --> 00:37:43,206
This was a mistake.

914
00:37:43,707 --> 00:37:45,941
Don't you dare say I
wasn't there for you.

915
00:37:45,942 --> 00:37:47,176
I was there for you.

916
00:37:47,177 --> 00:37:48,910
You were not!
You flew out.

917
00:37:48,911 --> 00:37:50,846
I <i>had</i> to fly out.
You said it was fine.

918
00:37:50,847 --> 00:37:52,849
- Because what <i>could</i> I say?
- That it <i>wasn't</i> fine.

919
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:55,751
But you were supposed
to <i>know</i> that it wasn't fine.

920
00:37:55,752 --> 00:37:59,188
- How??  - Oh, God, it's like
we never left each other.

921
00:37:59,189 --> 00:38:02,524
You know... thanks.

922
00:38:02,525 --> 00:38:03,992
I just thought

923
00:38:03,993 --> 00:38:06,227
I had done two years
of my life well,

924
00:38:06,228 --> 00:38:07,264
that's all.

925
00:38:09,065 --> 00:38:11,566
2006...

926
00:38:12,067 --> 00:38:13,768
and seven.

927
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:17,437
You did do it well.

928
00:38:20,676 --> 00:38:23,477
Sometimes it's too late.

929
00:38:28,416 --> 00:38:31,785
♪ One, two, three, four... ♪.

930
00:38:35,822 --> 00:38:37,423

00:38:37,424 --> 00:38:38,958
Not what I expected.

932
00:38:38,959 --> 00:38:41,561
- Is that good?
- It is.

933
00:38:42,062 --> 00:38:45,798
So... I met your son earlier.

934
00:38:45,799 --> 00:38:47,233
I know. He said.

935
00:38:47,234 --> 00:38:48,867
I was lame.

936
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:50,135
I was babbling.

937
00:38:50,136 --> 00:38:51,403
He didn't say that.

938
00:38:51,404 --> 00:38:54,006
I was.

939
00:38:54,007 --> 00:38:57,542
So... do you want
me to meet them?

940
00:38:58,243 --> 00:38:59,544
What?

941
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:00,446
No.

942
00:39:00,447 --> 00:39:02,147
I mean, formally.

943
00:39:02,148 --> 00:39:04,683
I know. No.

You sure?

945
00:39:05,851 --> 00:39:08,519
Because I could probably make
a good impression.

946
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:10,487
That's okay.

947
00:39:10,988 --> 00:39:12,623
Thanks.

948
00:39:14,559 --> 00:39:17,328
I mean, <i>really</i> thanks, Will.

949
00:39:17,329 --> 00:39:19,296
But it's not necessary.

950
00:39:19,297 --> 00:39:21,364
Okay. Good.

951
00:39:24,635 --> 00:39:26,837

Mr. Gardner?

956
00:39:39,415 --> 00:39:40,950
Excuse me.

957
00:39:40,951 --> 00:39:43,385
I'm really sorry
about earlier.

958
00:39:43,386 --> 00:39:44,820
For...?

959
00:39:45,921 --> 00:39:47,089
Nothing.

960
00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:48,557
I'm just figuring things
out here.

961
00:39:49,058 --> 00:39:50,025
Good.

962
00:39:50,026 --> 00:39:51,961
But why are you sorry?

963
00:39:51,962 --> 00:39:54,295
I just didn't mean
to come to you first.

964
00:39:54,296 --> 00:39:56,798
Alicia said if I had
any questions to come to her

965
00:39:56,799 --> 00:39:58,700
and not to bother the partners.

966
00:39:58,701 --> 00:40:00,736
No, you're not bothering us.
Don't worry about it.

967
00:40:00,737 --> 00:40:02,403
- Are you sure?
- I'm positive.

968
00:40:02,404 --> 00:40:04,139
Okay.

969
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,775
Thank you.

970
00:40:06,776 --> 00:40:08,876
Everybody's so nice here.

971
00:40:08,877 --> 00:40:10,878
Yeah. Lawyers.

972
00:40:10,879 --> 00:40:13,513
The nicest people
in the world.

973
00:40:13,514 --> 00:40:19,552

Oh, come on.

977
00:40:28,695 --> 00:40:29,896
Hey!

978
00:40:29,897 --> 00:40:31,864
One minute.

979
00:40:31,865 --> 00:40:33,800
Where are you putting me
now, the parking garage?

980
00:40:33,801 --> 00:40:36,235
- Excuse me?
- I won the Taiwan case.

981
00:40:36,236 --> 00:40:38,304
The one that
you sloughed off on me.

982
00:40:38,305 --> 00:40:40,072
We got Chen at the airport,
trying to flee.

983
00:40:40,073 --> 00:40:42,674
- He's going away for life.
- I'm not moving you.

984
00:40:42,975 --> 00:40:44,876
<i>Peter's</i> moving you.

985
00:40:47,546 --> 00:40:49,781
Peter? Where?

986
00:40:57,156 --> 00:41:00,224
There?

987
00:41:06,364 --> 00:41:07,664
I guess you kiss
enough butts,

988
00:41:07,665 --> 00:41:10,467
you eventually
kiss the right one.
