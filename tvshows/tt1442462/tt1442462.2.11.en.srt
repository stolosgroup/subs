2
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,481
Sorry to keep you
waiting, Mr. Medina.

3
00:00:25,482 --> 00:00:28,084
The eve before trial--
always a nightmare.

4
00:00:28,085 --> 00:00:29,385
You've met Kalinda?

5
00:00:29,386 --> 00:00:31,353
No.

6
00:00:32,756 --> 00:00:34,456
I'm Kalinda.

7
00:00:35,826 --> 00:00:37,426
Hal Peterman
speaks highly of you.

8
00:00:37,427 --> 00:00:39,161
He says you
helped him

9
00:00:39,162 --> 00:00:40,728
on the Michigan River
killings.

10
00:00:40,729 --> 00:00:42,097
And our client
suggested we meet.

11
00:00:42,098 --> 00:00:43,431
Yes, I've met Mr. Bauer.

12
00:00:43,432 --> 00:00:44,732
I like him.

13
00:00:44,733 --> 00:00:46,567
I do, too.

14
00:00:46,568 --> 00:00:48,804
Um, it's just that we already
have a jury consultant,

15
00:00:48,805 --> 00:00:50,772
and actually,
we already have a jury.

16
00:00:50,773 --> 00:00:52,908
I know. I don't pick
Oh.

17
00:00:52,909 --> 00:00:54,342
Then, what do you do?

18
00:00:54,343 --> 00:00:56,177
I read a jury's
micro-expressions

19
00:00:56,178 --> 00:00:58,179
to make sure that you
are persuading them...

20
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:59,346
or not.

21
00:00:59,347 --> 00:01:00,815
Micro-expressions?

22
00:01:00,816 --> 00:01:02,950
Uh, fleeting emotional displays

23
00:01:02,951 --> 00:01:04,852
revealing a person's
true feelings.

24
00:01:04,853 --> 00:01:06,253
And how much

25
00:01:06,254 --> 00:01:08,689
do you charge for
this... service?

26
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:10,257
$60,000 a week.

27
00:01:10,258 --> 00:01:13,360
Or $250,000
for the full trial.

28
00:01:15,029 --> 00:01:16,363
Can we try a test?

29
00:01:16,364 --> 00:01:17,464
Sure.

30
00:01:17,465 --> 00:01:19,666
What does this
micro-expression mean?

31
00:01:21,602 --> 00:01:22,869
It's prejudicial.

32
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:24,270
So you think
the prosecution

33
00:01:24,271 --> 00:01:25,372
won't try
to admit it?

34
00:01:25,373 --> 00:01:26,540
I know they will.

35
00:01:26,541 --> 00:01:28,040
But the judge
will see your job

36
00:01:28,041 --> 00:01:29,208
is irrelevant
to the crime.

37
00:01:29,209 --> 00:01:31,777
Just... people hate
what I do.

38
00:01:31,778 --> 00:01:34,046
Spam. Search engine optimization.

39
00:01:34,047 --> 00:01:35,381
Don't worry.

40
00:01:35,382 --> 00:01:38,951
The prosecution will be too busy
shoring up motive.

41
00:01:38,952 --> 00:01:40,820
They need to show that
you killed your father

42
00:01:40,821 --> 00:01:42,287
to keep him from
changing his will.

43
00:01:42,288 --> 00:01:43,822
My dad was my best friend.

44
00:01:43,823 --> 00:01:45,690
I would never hurt him.

45
00:01:45,691 --> 00:01:47,225
Get a good
night's sleep.

46
00:01:48,561 --> 00:01:51,128
It's good to
have you back.

47
00:01:51,129 --> 00:01:52,664
Thanks.

48
00:01:52,665 --> 00:01:54,065
I heard a lot happened.

49
00:01:55,501 --> 00:01:57,369
60 grand a week.

50
00:01:58,337 --> 00:02:00,404
Contract him for two.

51
00:02:00,405 --> 00:02:02,005
And stop by my
office afterwards.

52
00:02:02,006 --> 00:02:03,574
I have a quick thing
on Stanton.

53
00:02:03,575 --> 00:02:05,008
Sure.

54
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:06,343
Really?

55
00:02:06,344 --> 00:02:07,711
A jury whisperer?

56
00:02:07,712 --> 00:02:09,913
Hey, if the client
wants to pay.

57
00:02:09,914 --> 00:02:11,682
Use him as a tool.

58
00:02:11,683 --> 00:02:13,384
Do you have a second?

59
00:02:14,486 --> 00:02:16,986
You need to
talk to Diane.

60
00:02:16,987 --> 00:02:19,722
I think you already know
I did talk to Diane.

61
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:21,991
I know you threatened
to bar her

62
00:02:21,992 --> 00:02:24,159
from her office,
with security guards.

63
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,828
Diane is going
out on her own.

64
00:02:25,829 --> 00:02:27,263
She's poaching
clients, partners--

65
00:02:27,264 --> 00:02:28,831
What would you do?

66
00:02:28,832 --> 00:02:30,032
Calm her.

67
00:02:30,033 --> 00:02:31,867
We need to keep her
on the reservation

68
00:02:31,868 --> 00:02:34,068
for two more months.
Why?

69
00:02:36,506 --> 00:02:39,674
I'm bringing in an independent
expenditure only committee.

70
00:02:39,675 --> 00:02:40,776
A super PAC?
Yes.

71
00:02:40,777 --> 00:02:42,343
One of the biggest.

72
00:02:42,344 --> 00:02:45,514
$100 million of unlimited
corporate spending.

73
00:02:45,515 --> 00:02:48,181
But we need to stay whole
another two months.

74
00:02:48,182 --> 00:02:50,017
We can't scare them off
with civil war.

75
00:02:50,018 --> 00:02:51,685
And after two months?

76
00:02:51,686 --> 00:02:54,254
We push her out.

77
00:02:54,255 --> 00:02:57,057
So, calm the waters.

78
00:02:57,058 --> 00:02:59,627
Keep Diane from leaving.

79
00:02:59,628 --> 00:03:01,529
I'm leaving.

80
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:02,596
You're leaving?

81
00:03:02,597 --> 00:03:04,397
Okay. Where are
you leaving?

82
00:03:04,398 --> 00:03:05,832
Lockhart/Gardner.

83
00:03:06,801 --> 00:03:08,067
Do you need references?

84
00:03:10,771 --> 00:03:13,540
I made a mistake, Cary,
letting you go.

85
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:14,741
I've watched you grow

86
00:03:14,742 --> 00:03:16,142
at the state's
attorney's office,

87
00:03:16,143 --> 00:03:19,611
and I have to admit...
I've been awestruck.

88
00:03:19,612 --> 00:03:21,747
I like the state's
attorney's office.

89
00:03:21,748 --> 00:03:23,649
I know you do.
It's a good boot camp.

90
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:24,817
But at a certain point,

91
00:03:24,818 --> 00:03:26,452
you need to get back
in the game.

92
00:03:26,453 --> 00:03:28,587
You don't think
I'm in the game?

93
00:03:28,588 --> 00:03:31,590
I don't think you're being paid
as if you're in the game.

94
00:03:31,591 --> 00:03:33,425
I'm starting a new firm--

95
00:03:33,426 --> 00:03:35,927
with David Lee,
Julius Cain--

96
00:03:35,928 --> 00:03:38,563
and I want to offer you
a key seat at the table.

97
00:03:39,565 --> 00:03:41,265
How key?

98
00:03:41,266 --> 00:03:42,733
Senior associate.

99
00:03:42,734 --> 00:03:45,135
Two-year path
to equity partnership.

100
00:03:46,071 --> 00:03:47,738
Who else is going?

101
00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:49,574
Samuels...

102
00:03:49,575 --> 00:03:51,175
Hunter, Bachner,

103
00:03:51,176 --> 00:03:53,076
Mazin.
Kalinda?

104
00:03:53,077 --> 00:03:54,978
I don't know.

105
00:03:54,979 --> 00:03:57,347
She plays it
close to the vest,

106
00:03:57,348 --> 00:03:59,549
but, um...
she's unhappy.

107
00:04:00,518 --> 00:04:02,085
Alicia?

108
00:04:02,086 --> 00:04:04,955
I... I asked her.

109
00:04:04,956 --> 00:04:06,923
My guess is
she stays with Will.

110
00:04:06,924 --> 00:04:08,256
I'll consider it.

111
00:04:08,257 --> 00:04:09,424
Good.

112
00:04:09,425 --> 00:04:12,127
I need to know in a week.

113
00:04:12,128 --> 00:04:13,829
Is that doable?
Very.

114
00:04:15,932 --> 00:04:17,666
Good luck in court tomorrow.

115
00:04:20,871 --> 00:04:23,271
I don't know why we're having
this conversation.

116
00:04:23,272 --> 00:04:24,606
Really.

117
00:04:24,607 --> 00:04:26,007
Just the polling.
Nothing else.

118
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:29,844
The candidate's here?
Yeah.

119
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,048
Eli, come over here.

120
00:04:36,619 --> 00:04:38,452
Eli, meet Adam.
Adam, Eli.

121
00:04:38,453 --> 00:04:40,621
Ah. Eli Gold,

122
00:04:40,622 --> 00:04:42,789
"the terror
of Michigan Avenue."

123
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:45,225
Uh, just dropping by
for a visit?

124
00:04:45,226 --> 00:04:46,727
A visit with gifts.

125
00:04:46,728 --> 00:04:48,495
Oh, God...

126
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:50,063
What was her name?

127
00:04:50,064 --> 00:04:52,465
Melissa!

128
00:04:52,466 --> 00:04:54,167
Advance team in 2004.

129
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:56,002
Ah, this girl
right out of NYU--

130
00:04:56,003 --> 00:04:58,303
she brought in chili and gave
everybody food poisoning.

131
00:04:59,573 --> 00:05:00,907
I mean, people...

132
00:05:00,908 --> 00:05:03,142
people were puking
for days. Anyway...

133
00:05:03,143 --> 00:05:05,477
Adam's got some ideas
for fund-raising.

134
00:05:05,478 --> 00:05:07,046
Really?

135
00:05:07,047 --> 00:05:09,481
Yeah, well, I... I heard
you were struggling a bit.

136
00:05:09,482 --> 00:05:10,983
Momentarily.

137
00:05:10,984 --> 00:05:12,517
Yeah, but it's the impression.

138
00:05:12,518 --> 00:05:14,052
And you know
how impressions

139
00:05:14,053 --> 00:05:15,520
become facts
with big donors.

140
00:05:15,521 --> 00:05:17,188
Adam did some
good work for me

141
00:05:17,189 --> 00:05:18,990
on my first run,
and I just thought

142
00:05:18,991 --> 00:05:20,825
he could do
the same here.

143
00:05:20,826 --> 00:05:23,628
I mean, that is,
if it works for you two.

144
00:05:24,997 --> 00:05:28,999
I'm just here to help...
not get in your way.

145
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,868
It's Republican money.

146
00:05:30,869 --> 00:05:32,102
You don't know that.

147
00:05:32,103 --> 00:05:33,403
I know that.

148
00:05:33,404 --> 00:05:35,539
They want you to play spoiler.

149
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,575
They want to damage
the Democrats going into fall.

150
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:41,511
He's not coming in
above you, Eli.

151
00:05:41,512 --> 00:05:44,047
That's not what
this is about.

152
00:05:44,048 --> 00:05:46,015
Yes, it is-- and I'm
telling you right now--

153
00:05:46,016 --> 00:05:48,885
I am looking you in the eye--
you are the boss.

154
00:05:48,886 --> 00:05:51,054
Adam Boras works for you.

155
00:05:51,055 --> 00:05:54,023
But we need cash,
right now, or it's over.

156
00:05:54,024 --> 00:05:55,458
And if there
are strings attached?

157
00:05:55,459 --> 00:05:57,060
We say,
"No, thank you."

158
00:05:57,061 --> 00:06:00,395
And we hold our heads high
when we lose.

159
00:06:00,396 --> 00:06:02,197
Make this happen.

160
00:06:09,739 --> 00:06:11,773
Oh, good.

161
00:06:11,774 --> 00:06:13,108
You're on time.

162
00:06:15,911 --> 00:06:17,211
What are you doing,
playing dress-up?

163
00:06:17,212 --> 00:06:19,714
Um, we're a little bit behind
on the Stanton suit,

164
00:06:19,715 --> 00:06:22,083
so I'm going to need you
to help the associates, uh,

165
00:06:22,084 --> 00:06:24,051
run some background
checks today.

166
00:06:26,387 --> 00:06:27,989
Did you hear me?

167
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:29,824
They're real?

168
00:06:29,825 --> 00:06:31,592
Yes. Reading glasses.

169
00:06:31,593 --> 00:06:32,626
Oh.

170
00:06:32,627 --> 00:06:34,828
Um... look,

171
00:06:34,829 --> 00:06:37,563
you tell Bond to call
me in an hour.

172
00:06:38,766 --> 00:06:40,566
Kalinda, I don't think
you're getting this.

173
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:42,568
I assigned you a task:

174
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:44,237
help the associates
on Stanton.

175
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:46,172
I need it done now.

176
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:51,243
Look, we've had our fun
and games,

177
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,945
but it's over.

178
00:06:52,946 --> 00:06:56,214
I've been made your supervisor.

179
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:01,286
You know what?
That's good.

180
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:02,921
That's good. Have a laugh.

181
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:05,256
Have a...
have a big laugh, okay?

182
00:07:05,257 --> 00:07:07,759
And go outside,
and then compose yourself.

183
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,162
And then come back in,
ready to work.

184
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:15,266
Thank you.

185
00:07:15,267 --> 00:07:17,334
For what?

186
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:20,436
<i>Your client didn't want</i>

187
00:07:20,437 --> 00:07:22,605
to be written out of a will,
so he pushed

188
00:07:22,606 --> 00:07:24,841
his rich father out
of a 12th-floor window.

189
00:07:24,842 --> 00:07:26,376
Have you seen these photos?

190
00:07:26,377 --> 00:07:27,878
Yeah, and they look

191
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:29,646
pretty prejudicial to me.

192
00:07:29,647 --> 00:07:31,114
My guess is
the jury never sees them.

193
00:07:31,115 --> 00:07:32,549
You now what they did
in Roman times

194
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:33,817
to people who killed
their fathers?

195
00:07:33,818 --> 00:07:36,786
Put them in a sack with
a snake, a chicken and a dog,

196
00:07:36,787 --> 00:07:38,120
and threw them in a river.

197
00:07:38,121 --> 00:07:41,157
Are we really plea-bargaining
down from Roman times?

198
00:07:41,158 --> 00:07:43,225
What'll you give me,
just a chicken?

199
00:07:43,226 --> 00:07:45,561
Bauer confesses
to his father's murder,

200
00:07:45,562 --> 00:07:47,296
and we'll bump it down to...

201
00:07:47,297 --> 00:07:48,297
Twenty-five.

202
00:07:48,298 --> 00:07:49,631
25 years.

203
00:07:49,632 --> 00:07:51,733
Now, that's a good day's work

204
00:07:51,734 --> 00:07:54,535
for Gardner, Bond.

205
00:07:54,536 --> 00:07:57,471
Hey, hold on one second, Cary.

206
00:07:57,472 --> 00:07:59,240
Your Honor!

207
00:07:59,241 --> 00:08:01,076
No, His Honor Weldon.

208
00:08:01,077 --> 00:08:03,311
Ah, that's why

209
00:08:03,312 --> 00:08:05,479
we're plea-bargaining during
the middle of your game, huh?

210
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:08,348
I'm sorry, Cary. Could you
hold on one more second?

211
00:08:08,349 --> 00:08:09,482
Your Honor,

212
00:08:09,483 --> 00:08:11,318
it's your day
to collect cell phones.

213
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:14,221
Ah. Girlfriend?

214
00:08:14,222 --> 00:08:15,823
Yeah. Her place or mine.

215
00:08:15,824 --> 00:08:17,157
Real negotiation.

216
00:08:17,158 --> 00:08:18,658
I'll be right with you, honey.

217
00:08:18,659 --> 00:08:19,760
Think that chicken in the sack's

218
00:08:19,761 --> 00:08:21,895
looking pretty good
about now, Cicero.

219
00:08:21,896 --> 00:08:23,396
Let's talk manslaughter.
Two years.

220
00:08:23,397 --> 00:08:25,331
We can get a recusal.

221
00:08:25,332 --> 00:08:26,599
Yeah, that's a good idea.

222
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,901
Judges love to be asked
toecuse themselves

223
00:08:28,902 --> 00:08:30,169
on the first day of trial.

224
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:31,670
We'll take it to
the chief judge.

225
00:08:31,671 --> 00:08:33,606
Hold on. I think he's here, too.

226
00:08:33,607 --> 00:08:34,841
And don't get all outraged.

227
00:08:34,842 --> 00:08:36,575
The state's attorney plays poker

228
00:08:36,576 --> 00:08:38,177
with half the judges
in Cook County.

229
00:08:38,178 --> 00:08:41,947
And Ms. Pine, you play tennis
with Chief Adler, don't you?

230
00:08:41,948 --> 00:08:44,616
Look, Cary, I'll be playing
for the next two hours.

231
00:08:44,617 --> 00:08:46,818
Phone my cell,
or we're going to court.

232
00:08:47,954 --> 00:08:50,455
We can offer second-degree.

233
00:08:50,456 --> 00:08:51,522
No.

234
00:08:51,523 --> 00:08:53,191
A year ago,
this guy killed a man,

235
00:08:53,192 --> 00:08:54,525
and the jury will see that.

236
00:08:54,526 --> 00:08:56,527
And Judge Weldon?

237
00:08:56,528 --> 00:08:59,864
Will's playing basketball
with him, that's all.

238
00:08:59,865 --> 00:09:02,032
Unless he can play
with the whole jury,

239
00:09:02,033 --> 00:09:03,501
I say we trust the evidence.

240
00:09:04,536 --> 00:09:05,970
Okay.

241
00:09:09,608 --> 00:09:11,242
I'm sorry.

242
00:09:11,243 --> 00:09:12,809
You were saying something
about skills?

243
00:09:15,212 --> 00:09:17,213
What are you doing?
Nothing.

244
00:09:17,214 --> 00:09:19,483
At least look like
you're trying.

245
00:09:20,551 --> 00:09:23,119
What, you afraid
to D me up?

246
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,955
Ball in.

247
00:09:33,397 --> 00:09:34,730
You're going to
guard me now, Will?

248
00:09:34,731 --> 00:09:35,931
I'll guard you.

249
00:09:35,932 --> 00:09:37,499
You'll try.

250
00:09:40,736 --> 00:09:42,069
What the hell was that?

251
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:43,438
What? You said
to guard you.

252
00:09:43,439 --> 00:09:44,739
I didn't say
mug me!

253
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:47,008
You want to call the
foul, call the foul.

254
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:49,477
Ball up.

255
00:09:53,915 --> 00:09:56,917
Hey, sorry about
that back there.

256
00:09:56,918 --> 00:09:58,619
I got a little
carried away.

257
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,020
No second gear.

258
00:10:00,988 --> 00:10:02,489
We're good, right?

259
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,495
Just messing with you.

260
00:10:08,496 --> 00:10:09,829
Yeah, we're good.
We're good.

261
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:11,163
You sure?

262
00:10:12,599 --> 00:10:14,934
Yes.
What, you want me not to be?

263
00:10:14,935 --> 00:10:17,337
No, no.
As long as we're cool.

264
00:10:17,338 --> 00:10:18,738
Let's go.

265
00:10:20,006 --> 00:10:23,209
No, no, I...
I think I'm a bit tired.

266
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:25,044
I'm heading home.

The Good Wife - Season 2, Episode 11
Two Courts

269
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,008
Thank you.

270
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:48,546
I'm sorry.

271
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:50,215
Excuse me?

272
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:51,783
Don't make this harder.

273
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:53,951
No, I literally didn't
hear what you said.

274
00:10:53,952 --> 00:10:58,055
I'm sorry that I threatened
to bar you from work.

275
00:10:59,524 --> 00:11:02,126
I'm sorry
that I lost my cool.

276
00:11:06,297 --> 00:11:08,532
So what do we do?

277
00:11:09,734 --> 00:11:11,901
I don't want you to leave.

278
00:11:11,902 --> 00:11:15,071
I want to make things different,
so you don't leave.

279
00:11:16,306 --> 00:11:18,307
You'll stop seeing
other women?

280
00:11:23,648 --> 00:11:25,147
So what do you want?

281
00:11:25,148 --> 00:11:27,983
I want transparency.

282
00:11:27,984 --> 00:11:30,385
I want us to share
our client lists.

283
00:11:32,221 --> 00:11:34,222
Share, as in...?

284
00:11:34,223 --> 00:11:37,726
Meetings, calls...
everything.

285
00:11:39,663 --> 00:11:42,163
Now, that would worry me
if you were leaving,

286
00:11:42,164 --> 00:11:45,733
because that would mean you
have time to solicit my clients.

287
00:11:46,735 --> 00:11:49,003
So it's a good thing
I'm not leaving.

288
00:11:49,004 --> 00:11:50,672
<i>As you can see, Your Honor,</i>

289
00:11:50,673 --> 00:11:52,740
they're highly
prejudicial.

290
00:11:52,741 --> 00:11:53,941
And highly accurate.

291
00:11:53,942 --> 00:11:55,176
Overruled.

292
00:11:55,177 --> 00:11:56,910
It's best evidence. What else?

293
00:11:56,911 --> 00:11:59,579
Sorry, Your Honor.
I was, uh... delayed.

294
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:01,748
Let the record reflect
that Mr. Gardner

295
00:12:01,749 --> 00:12:03,283
has joined our
little party.

296
00:12:03,284 --> 00:12:04,517
Anything else, counselors?

297
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:09,022
Your Honor, we believe
our client's profession

298
00:12:09,023 --> 00:12:11,024
is irrelevant
to this crime.

299
00:12:11,025 --> 00:12:13,358
And every reference
to it would be prejudicial.

300
00:12:13,359 --> 00:12:14,526
We agree,

301
00:12:14,527 --> 00:12:15,861
and we will make
no such reference.

302
00:12:15,862 --> 00:12:17,797
Good. Agreement.
How refreshing.

303
00:12:17,798 --> 00:12:19,531
But we ask
for the inclusion

304
00:12:19,532 --> 00:12:21,701
of evidence
of the defendant's drinking.

305
00:12:21,702 --> 00:12:23,703
Yes, and we would argue

306
00:12:23,704 --> 00:12:25,637
this denial is why
the victim threatened

307
00:12:25,638 --> 00:12:27,372
to write your client
out of his will.

308
00:12:27,373 --> 00:12:29,607
We ask to include
photographic evidence

309
00:12:29,608 --> 00:12:31,242
of the defendant
with an alcoholic beverage.

310
00:12:31,243 --> 00:12:32,543
When was this?

311
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:33,978
A World War II
reenactment,

312
00:12:33,979 --> 00:12:35,914
October 2009.

313
00:12:35,915 --> 00:12:37,648
We found this photograph
during a search

314
00:12:37,649 --> 00:12:39,117
of the defendant's
apartment.

315
00:12:40,652 --> 00:12:41,953
Objection, Your Honor.

316
00:12:41,954 --> 00:12:43,454
You're kidding me.
Oh, I'm sorry.

317
00:12:43,455 --> 00:12:45,455
Is that not your client
holding a beer?

318
00:12:45,456 --> 00:12:47,791
Yes, and we would stipulate he
had the occasional beer, but...

319
00:12:47,792 --> 00:12:49,093
Well, we don't have
to stipulate.

320
00:12:49,094 --> 00:12:50,560
We have a photograph
proving it.

321
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:51,895
Your Honor, our client
is a World War II buff.

322
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:54,131
It's just his hobby.
But without context...

323
00:12:54,132 --> 00:12:56,399
Then we suggest
the defense give it context.

324
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,135
Your Honor, this is
not about drinking.

325
00:12:58,136 --> 00:13:01,070
This is about playing
on a jury's bias.

326
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:03,239
This is about seeing
our client as a Nazi.

327
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,642
I think the jury is smart
enough to distinguish

328
00:13:06,643 --> 00:13:09,979
between a World War II buff
and a murderer. Overruled.

329
00:13:11,181 --> 00:13:13,349
Let's get this
started.

330
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:17,953
There was no sign
of forced entry.

331
00:13:17,954 --> 00:13:19,988
There was blood
from the victim

332
00:13:19,989 --> 00:13:22,590
on the balcony, here.

333
00:13:22,591 --> 00:13:24,659
And the victim was discovered
12 stories below.

334
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,261
Why did you arrest Mr. Bauer?

335
00:13:26,262 --> 00:13:29,430
Forensic technicians
found DNA

336
00:13:29,431 --> 00:13:32,333
under the victim's fingernails,
which matched

337
00:13:32,334 --> 00:13:34,001
Mr. Scott Bauer.

338
00:13:34,002 --> 00:13:35,602
Neighbors had also complained
of hearing an argument

339
00:13:35,603 --> 00:13:37,604
between Mr. Bauer
and his father.

340
00:13:37,605 --> 00:13:39,273
And then you searched
Mr. Bauer's home?

341
00:13:39,274 --> 00:13:40,607
Yes, sir.

342
00:13:40,608 --> 00:13:41,742
And what did you find?

343
00:13:43,645 --> 00:13:45,646
This photo shows Mr. Bauer
holding a beer.

344
00:13:45,647 --> 00:13:47,614
Is that correct?
Yes.

345
00:13:47,615 --> 00:13:49,315
In his right hand.

346
00:13:49,316 --> 00:13:51,617
And he claimed he
didn't drink-- is that correct?

347
00:13:51,618 --> 00:13:54,553
There are seven
universal emotions:

348
00:13:54,554 --> 00:13:56,656
disgust, anger, fear...

349
00:13:56,657 --> 00:13:57,991
Just the bottom line.

350
00:13:57,992 --> 00:13:59,225
Four jurors

351
00:13:59,226 --> 00:14:01,627
were moved
to brief micro-bursts

352
00:14:01,628 --> 00:14:03,329
of disgust.

353
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:05,130
At the crime scene photos?

354
00:14:05,131 --> 00:14:07,732
No. No, the crime photos
created universal disgust.

355
00:14:07,733 --> 00:14:09,467
The photos of Mr. Bauer

356
00:14:09,468 --> 00:14:11,403
engendered feelings
of directed disgust

357
00:14:11,404 --> 00:14:14,072
at Mr. Bauer.

358
00:14:14,073 --> 00:14:17,375
Great. They think we have
Colonel Klink as a client.

359
00:14:17,376 --> 00:14:19,178
We still have
the robbery evidence.

360
00:14:19,179 --> 00:14:20,912
Kalinda, can you get
everything together

361
00:14:20,913 --> 00:14:23,480
on the robberies?

362
00:14:28,086 --> 00:14:30,654
No.

363
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:33,357
Look, I don't want to have
to go over your head.

364
00:14:33,358 --> 00:14:35,827
Good, because there
is no over my head.

365
00:14:35,828 --> 00:14:37,360
You spent too much
on push polling,

366
00:14:37,361 --> 00:14:39,930
and now your ego won't
let you back down.

367
00:14:39,931 --> 00:14:41,331
I've brought in
the cash that--

368
00:14:41,332 --> 00:14:43,599
Which buys you
a place at the table.

369
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,868
Welcome.

370
00:14:44,869 --> 00:14:46,937
The most I have to do
is listen to you.

371
00:14:46,938 --> 00:14:48,839
I have listened,
and I have found you wanting.

372
00:14:57,347 --> 00:15:00,449
Unless that's Buddha
and Jesus on speed dial,

373
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:03,052
I don't think we have
much to talk about.

374
00:15:03,053 --> 00:15:04,419
Jackie, how are you?

375
00:15:05,621 --> 00:15:06,956
Yeah.

376
00:15:06,957 --> 00:15:08,523
Yeah. Hi. It's Adam.

377
00:15:08,524 --> 00:15:10,191
You know, it's funny.
I'm sitting right here

378
00:15:10,192 --> 00:15:11,692
with Eli Gold.

379
00:15:11,693 --> 00:15:13,461
I'm sorry-- do you
know Peter's mother?

380
00:15:13,462 --> 00:15:16,030
We became friends
during the '04 campaign.

381
00:15:16,031 --> 00:15:17,531
She's the one who
phoned me to help.

382
00:15:17,532 --> 00:15:19,433
Uh-huh? No.
No, no, no, no.

383
00:15:19,434 --> 00:15:20,634
We're playing nice.

384
00:15:22,271 --> 00:15:25,472
You are such
a kidder.

385
00:15:25,473 --> 00:15:28,575
You said there were
signs of a struggle, Detective?

386
00:15:28,576 --> 00:15:30,210
I did, yes.

387
00:15:30,211 --> 00:15:32,479
And you had been in
the neighborhood a week earlier

388
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,748
and found a similar scene,
hadn't you?

389
00:15:34,749 --> 00:15:37,050
Objection.
Irrelevant and immaterial.

390
00:15:37,051 --> 00:15:38,418
Overruled.
You may answer.

391
00:15:38,419 --> 00:15:40,487
Your Honor,
may we approach the bench?

392
00:15:40,488 --> 00:15:41,553
You may.

393
00:15:41,554 --> 00:15:42,989
You'll have to excuse us.

394
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:45,824
We're not being rude
intentionally.

395
00:15:47,227 --> 00:15:49,228
Your Honor, the defense
is trying to draw a connection

396
00:15:49,229 --> 00:15:50,662
between this murder
and three unsolved robberies

397
00:15:50,663 --> 00:15:52,564
in the neighborhood.
We would ask for a proffer

398
00:15:52,565 --> 00:15:56,068
Oh, come on. before they continue
with this line of questioning.

399
00:15:56,069 --> 00:15:57,468
There was no sign
of forced entry.

400
00:15:57,469 --> 00:15:59,004
There was no sign
of forced entry

401
00:15:59,005 --> 00:16:00,071
in the other burglaries, either.

402
00:16:00,072 --> 00:16:01,940
Doors were chosen
without peepholes

403
00:16:01,941 --> 00:16:03,141
so the victim
would come to the door.

404
00:16:03,142 --> 00:16:04,242
The police
cross-referenced

405
00:16:04,243 --> 00:16:06,144
the victims' belongings
with an inventory

406
00:16:06,145 --> 00:16:07,578
filed with his
insurance carrier.

407
00:16:07,579 --> 00:16:08,679
Nothing was missing.

408
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,248
Then let the
prosecution argue that,

409
00:16:10,249 --> 00:16:12,583
and let the jury
decide, Your Honor.

410
00:16:14,185 --> 00:16:16,653
I'm siding with the
prosecution on this.

411
00:16:16,654 --> 00:16:17,821
Unless you can
present evidence

412
00:16:17,822 --> 00:16:19,589
to support a theory
of robbery,

413
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:21,125
I'll sustain
the objection.

414
00:16:21,126 --> 00:16:23,327
What objection?
There was none.

415
00:16:23,328 --> 00:16:24,428
Objection.

416
00:16:24,429 --> 00:16:26,397
Sustained.

417
00:16:29,266 --> 00:16:33,436
Do you have a problem,
Mr. Gardner?

418
00:16:33,437 --> 00:16:36,439
Should I have a problem?

419
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:39,275
Well, that's up
to you, isn't it?

420
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,314
Could've gone either way.

421
00:16:45,315 --> 00:16:47,782
No. He's deciding
against us.

422
00:16:47,783 --> 00:16:50,118
What do you want to do?

423
00:16:52,855 --> 00:16:54,789
What's going on?

424
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:56,224
What do you mean?

425
00:16:56,225 --> 00:16:57,525
You.

426
00:17:04,132 --> 00:17:05,899
What's your address?

427
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,534
My address?

428
00:17:07,535 --> 00:17:09,869
Your old address,
before you worked here.

429
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:12,738
2266 Weyburn. Why?

430
00:17:12,739 --> 00:17:16,042
I took this from
Blake's car.

431
00:17:16,043 --> 00:17:20,546
And for some reason, it has
your old address in it.

432
00:17:20,547 --> 00:17:22,048
What?

433
00:17:22,049 --> 00:17:24,884
He also wrote down a name.

434
00:17:24,885 --> 00:17:26,818
Um, Marcie Raines?

435
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:28,387
That was my neighbor.

436
00:17:28,388 --> 00:17:31,490
Someone he interviewed
over a month ago.

437
00:17:39,199 --> 00:17:40,599
What are you doing?

438
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,000
Excuse me?

439
00:17:42,001 --> 00:17:43,667
What are you doing
investigating me?

440
00:17:43,668 --> 00:17:46,504
You talked to my neighbor? Look...

441
00:17:46,505 --> 00:17:48,672
Who the hell told you
you could talk to my neighbor?

442
00:17:48,673 --> 00:17:50,208
Look, Alicia...

443
00:17:50,209 --> 00:17:51,342
Don't you dare try to calm me.

444
00:17:51,343 --> 00:17:53,577
It was just a simple
background check.

445
00:17:53,578 --> 00:17:54,778
By who?

446
00:17:54,779 --> 00:17:56,314
Who told you
to background-check?

447
00:17:57,282 --> 00:17:59,683
I unfortunately can't say.

448
00:17:59,684 --> 00:18:01,785
Don't you ever look
into my background again.

449
00:18:20,638 --> 00:18:22,238
<i>Do you have a minute?</i>

450
00:18:22,239 --> 00:18:24,040
Sure.

451
00:18:25,042 --> 00:18:26,876
Oh, that's right.

452
00:18:26,877 --> 00:18:28,945
You wanted to talk when
things calmed down.

453
00:18:28,946 --> 00:18:30,946
During the
death row appeal,

454
00:18:30,947 --> 00:18:33,081
you said you wanted to
talk about something.

455
00:18:33,082 --> 00:18:34,783
Oh, no. I mean, yes.

456
00:18:34,784 --> 00:18:36,284
Um, at some point.

457
00:18:36,285 --> 00:18:37,953
But this is
something else.

458
00:18:37,954 --> 00:18:40,055
Someone told Blake to do
a background check on me.

459
00:18:40,056 --> 00:18:42,057
Some...

460
00:18:42,058 --> 00:18:43,725
What?!

461
00:18:43,726 --> 00:18:45,060
He investigated my
old neighborhood.

462
00:18:45,061 --> 00:18:46,493
He talked to my
old neighbors.

463
00:18:46,494 --> 00:18:48,095
He said it was a
background check.

464
00:18:48,096 --> 00:18:50,230
What's going on?
I have no idea.

465
00:18:50,231 --> 00:18:51,832
It's just...
No, you don't have to explain.

466
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:53,568
I'll find out.
I didn't ask for it.

467
00:18:53,569 --> 00:18:54,936
Diane didn't ask for it.

468
00:18:54,937 --> 00:18:57,705
And Bond?

469
00:18:59,407 --> 00:19:00,875
I'll find out.

470
00:19:03,477 --> 00:19:05,679
That's not what I
wanted to talk about

471
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,246
when I asked before.

472
00:19:07,247 --> 00:19:08,848
It...

473
00:19:08,849 --> 00:19:10,684
I know what it is.

474
00:19:12,286 --> 00:19:14,320
You...?

475
00:19:14,321 --> 00:19:16,422
How do you know?

476
00:19:16,423 --> 00:19:18,657
Diane told me.

477
00:19:22,028 --> 00:19:24,830
Are we possibly talking
about two different things?

478
00:19:27,133 --> 00:19:29,334
Diane asked you
to join her at her new firm.

479
00:19:30,604 --> 00:19:32,938
Yes.

480
00:19:32,939 --> 00:19:34,939
That's what it was.

481
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:38,443
I wanted to tell you,
but she invoked confidentiality.

482
00:19:38,444 --> 00:19:40,945
I get it. Don't worry.

483
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:42,514
I don't want to go with her.

484
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:44,782
Good.

485
00:19:44,783 --> 00:19:46,851
I'm glad.

486
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:54,024
Okay. I'm going now.

487
00:19:54,025 --> 00:19:58,562
Maybe another time,
things will slow down.

488
00:19:58,563 --> 00:20:00,464
<i>Yes, I phoned him.</i>

489
00:20:00,465 --> 00:20:02,399
If you don't mind
me saying so,

490
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,634
that was a mistake.

491
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:05,802
Oh, I don't mind
you saying so.

492
00:20:05,803 --> 00:20:07,570
The money he brings
has strings attached.

493
00:20:07,571 --> 00:20:09,805
You see, Mr. Gold,

494
00:20:09,806 --> 00:20:12,975
I've just been so out of touch
with the campaign.

495
00:20:12,976 --> 00:20:17,547
I... I wanted to help,
so I phoned an old friend,

496
00:20:17,548 --> 00:20:21,384
someone who always
kept me in touch.

497
00:20:21,385 --> 00:20:24,153
I just...

498
00:20:24,154 --> 00:20:26,488
haven't wanted
to trouble you, ma'am.

499
00:20:26,489 --> 00:20:28,823
Oh, yes.
Well, I'm sure that's it.

500
00:20:28,824 --> 00:20:32,060
Adam doesn't mind
troubling me.

501
00:20:35,165 --> 00:20:36,498
Your Honor.

502
00:20:36,499 --> 00:20:38,199
You didn't play tonight.

503
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,536
Nope. Gotta prepare
for trial tomorrow.

504
00:20:41,537 --> 00:20:44,272
Look, Judge...

505
00:20:44,273 --> 00:20:47,341
I feel like the other night,
you and I got into it and...

506
00:20:47,342 --> 00:20:49,009
It was just a game.
That's all.

507
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:50,178
I've already
forgotten about it.

508
00:20:50,179 --> 00:20:52,246
Uh, me, too.

509
00:20:52,247 --> 00:20:55,348
Except, in court,
it feels like...

510
00:20:55,349 --> 00:20:57,417
you know.

511
00:20:57,418 --> 00:20:59,586
No. I don't know.

512
00:20:59,587 --> 00:21:01,588
Why don't you enlighten me?

513
00:21:01,589 --> 00:21:03,456
You're not going to make this
easy for me, are you?

514
00:21:03,457 --> 00:21:06,393
Look, if you're trying to accuse
me of something, counselor,

515
00:21:06,394 --> 00:21:08,695
why don't you just
come out and say it?

516
00:21:08,696 --> 00:21:10,762
Okay.

517
00:21:10,763 --> 00:21:13,299
You're mad because
I fouled you,

518
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,933
and you're taxing me in
court because of it.

519
00:21:14,934 --> 00:21:16,202
You're letting
the SA's office

520
00:21:16,203 --> 00:21:18,637
put any damn thing they
want into evidence.

521
00:21:18,638 --> 00:21:21,073
Maybe the SA's office would
like to know that you're having

522
00:21:21,074 --> 00:21:23,209
ex parte discussions
with me, about the case,

523
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:25,777
behind their back.
You're one to talk.

524
00:21:25,778 --> 00:21:26,977
Watch it, Will.

525
00:21:26,978 --> 00:21:28,179
No, you watch it.
You're the...

526
00:21:32,585 --> 00:21:33,984
You need to recuse yourself.

527
00:21:35,153 --> 00:21:36,554
I'm asking you
to recuse yourself.

528
00:21:36,555 --> 00:21:37,555
No.

529
00:21:37,556 --> 00:21:39,557
Then, let me withdraw,

530
00:21:39,558 --> 00:21:41,626
because right now I'm doing
a disservice to my client.

531
00:21:41,627 --> 00:21:43,793
No. We have got a jury.

532
00:21:43,794 --> 00:21:45,962
I am not giving anyone grounds
for mistrial.

533
00:21:45,963 --> 00:21:48,332
You took the case.
You try it.

534
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:50,667
It's called defense.

535
00:21:50,668 --> 00:21:52,736
You should learn to play some.

536
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,474
That's the one
to keep your eye on.

537
00:22:06,475 --> 00:22:09,076
Right there
in the center.

538
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:10,912
He's the leader.

539
00:22:10,913 --> 00:22:12,146
Now, he's not
the most handsome.

540
00:22:12,147 --> 00:22:13,581
He's not the richest.

541
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:17,317
He's not the... he's not
the most knowledgeable.

542
00:22:17,318 --> 00:22:19,820
But he's
the pack leader.

543
00:22:19,821 --> 00:22:23,189
You see,
people are like dogs.

544
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:27,160
The way to read them
is like dogs.

545
00:22:27,161 --> 00:22:29,429
It's a pack mentality.

546
00:22:30,431 --> 00:22:33,600
How much do you
make in a year?

547
00:22:33,601 --> 00:22:36,536
I don't know. Varies.

548
00:22:36,537 --> 00:22:37,938
But you work.

549
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:39,705
People actually hire you.

550
00:22:39,706 --> 00:22:42,641
Yes. I have an 80%
prediction rate.

551
00:22:42,642 --> 00:22:45,377
Yeah. I looked into
your past cases.

552
00:22:45,378 --> 00:22:46,845
You're very selective.

553
00:22:46,846 --> 00:22:50,182
You seem to choose cases
that are easy to predict.

554
00:22:50,183 --> 00:22:52,184
People don't complain.

555
00:22:52,185 --> 00:22:53,852
People want to
believe in magic.

556
00:22:55,721 --> 00:22:57,956
There. There they go.

557
00:22:57,957 --> 00:22:59,857
The pack disperses.

558
00:22:59,858 --> 00:23:02,526
It readjusts.
It follows.

559
00:23:02,527 --> 00:23:04,528
Some stay behind.

560
00:23:04,529 --> 00:23:07,164
That's not magic, ma'am.

561
00:23:07,165 --> 00:23:09,734
People are not unique.

562
00:23:09,735 --> 00:23:12,302
They are as predictable
as the tides;

563
00:23:12,303 --> 00:23:14,537
as trainable as pets.

564
00:23:21,245 --> 00:23:23,146
<i>Here's what I think
we should do.</i>

565
00:23:23,147 --> 00:23:24,547
Judge Weldon is biased.

566
00:23:24,548 --> 00:23:27,083
I think we can get
his bias to work for us.

567
00:23:27,084 --> 00:23:30,152
I'm going to provoke him
by asking for a recusal.

568
00:23:30,153 --> 00:23:32,822
And I'm afraid I need you
to bear the brunt of his anger.

569
00:23:32,823 --> 00:23:34,657
The jury will react more
if they see him

570
00:23:34,658 --> 00:23:35,825
being biased against you.

571
00:23:35,826 --> 00:23:37,593
You're going for
jury nullification?

572
00:23:37,594 --> 00:23:39,328
Yes, or a strong appeal.

573
00:23:39,329 --> 00:23:41,563
We can't undo his bias,
but we can push it.

574
00:23:41,564 --> 00:23:44,298
Okay.
Whatever you need.

575
00:23:47,236 --> 00:23:49,004
What's going on?

576
00:23:49,005 --> 00:23:50,705
What's going on
with Blake?

577
00:23:50,706 --> 00:23:52,273
You mean my supervisor?

578
00:23:52,274 --> 00:23:54,242
What are you talking about?

579
00:23:54,243 --> 00:23:56,444
Blake has been made
my supervisor.

580
00:23:56,445 --> 00:23:57,578
No, he hasn't.

581
00:23:57,579 --> 00:24:00,014
Wait.

582
00:24:01,382 --> 00:24:03,684
Alicia says he's been
doing background checks

583
00:24:03,685 --> 00:24:05,019
on the associates.

584
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:07,020
Yeah. Partners, too.

585
00:24:07,021 --> 00:24:10,357
But I'm sure it's
all innocent.

586
00:24:10,358 --> 00:24:13,126
Anyway, I just wanted
to wish you good luck.

587
00:24:13,127 --> 00:24:15,962
Wait. Kalinda, stop.

588
00:24:17,865 --> 00:24:20,133
What can I do?

589
00:24:20,134 --> 00:24:22,134
I need you here, working.

590
00:24:22,135 --> 00:24:24,470
$50,000 a year increase.

591
00:24:26,473 --> 00:24:28,274
That's...

592
00:24:28,275 --> 00:24:31,544
too much.

593
00:24:31,545 --> 00:24:34,813
You just paid 120 grand
for a medicine man,

594
00:24:34,814 --> 00:24:37,782
so don't talk to me
about too much.

595
00:24:40,586 --> 00:24:43,888
<i>His name is Adam Boras.
Part of Peter's</i>

596
00:24:43,889 --> 00:24:45,756
2004 campaign.

597
00:24:45,757 --> 00:24:47,725
He jokes a lot
with Peter.

598
00:24:47,726 --> 00:24:50,228
Talks fondly
about old times.

599
00:24:50,229 --> 00:24:51,462
No.

600
00:24:51,463 --> 00:24:53,664
What?

601
00:24:53,665 --> 00:24:56,132
This only works when you don't
try to manipulate me, Mr. Gold.

602
00:24:56,133 --> 00:24:58,134
You want to get rid of someone,
get rid of someone.

603
00:24:58,135 --> 00:24:59,636
Mrs. Florrick, I wanted
to show you something.

604
00:24:59,637 --> 00:25:01,305
Excuse me.

605
00:25:01,306 --> 00:25:02,406
This is from
one of my friends.

606
00:25:02,407 --> 00:25:03,973
You see the label
on the bottle?

607
00:25:03,974 --> 00:25:05,576
It's a non-alcoholic beer.

608
00:25:05,577 --> 00:25:07,744
That's great.
I'll tell Will.

609
00:25:07,745 --> 00:25:10,680
Thank you.
I'm just nervous.

610
00:25:10,681 --> 00:25:12,014
As you can imagine.

611
00:25:15,686 --> 00:25:17,152
Go ahead, say it.

612
00:25:17,153 --> 00:25:19,255
No. No, I wasn't going
to say anything.

613
00:25:19,256 --> 00:25:21,657
Nazis need to be
defended, too.

614
00:25:22,826 --> 00:25:24,760
Feel better getting that out?

615
00:25:24,761 --> 00:25:26,628
<i>Jawohl.</i>

616
00:25:26,629 --> 00:25:28,964
You're right-- this Boras
thing is my problem.

617
00:25:28,965 --> 00:25:32,034
It's just that I found out
he was phoned by Jackie.

618
00:25:32,035 --> 00:25:33,869
That sounds about right.

619
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:36,004
I need to talk to Peter

620
00:25:36,005 --> 00:25:37,706
about Jackie's influence
in the campaign.

621
00:25:37,707 --> 00:25:39,441
Any thoughts on that?
No.

622
00:25:39,442 --> 00:25:41,509
Thanks, anyway.

623
00:25:43,212 --> 00:25:45,279
Eli...

624
00:25:47,449 --> 00:25:50,384
There's only one thing
Jackie loves in life.

625
00:25:50,385 --> 00:25:53,554
She won't listen to me,
and she won't listen to you.

626
00:25:53,555 --> 00:25:55,456
She'll only listen to Peter.

627
00:25:55,457 --> 00:25:57,524
That's how you handle Jackie.

628
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,995
You've got a motion, counselor,
before I call the jury?

629
00:26:01,996 --> 00:26:03,630
Yes, I do.

630
00:26:03,631 --> 00:26:07,333
We ask you,
with all due deference,

631
00:26:07,334 --> 00:26:08,601
to recuse yourself.

632
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,406
The motion is denied.

633
00:26:14,407 --> 00:26:18,010
Your Honor, you have been
using a private grudge

634
00:26:18,011 --> 00:26:19,645
to rule from bias.

635
00:26:19,646 --> 00:26:21,380
You've got a lot of nerve.

636
00:26:21,381 --> 00:26:23,315
You've left me
no other option.

637
00:26:24,417 --> 00:26:25,751
Please address me
as "Your Honor."

638
00:26:25,752 --> 00:26:27,219
Your Honor,

639
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:29,321
I fouled you
in basketball.

640
00:26:29,322 --> 00:26:31,823
You can sit down
right now, counselor.

641
00:26:31,824 --> 00:26:33,691
Your bias is clear to all.

642
00:26:33,692 --> 00:26:36,060
I have never held a lawyer
in contempt before, Mr. Gardner,

643
00:26:36,061 --> 00:26:37,328
but I will break that streak

644
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:39,164
if you don't sit
the hell down-- now.

645
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:45,670
Call the jury.

646
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:53,243
And that's when I saw
Mr. Bauer and his son--

647
00:26:53,244 --> 00:26:54,679
there-- arguing.

648
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,747
And did you hear
what they were arguing over?

649
00:26:56,748 --> 00:26:58,316
Yes. I'm not a snoop.

650
00:26:58,317 --> 00:27:02,519
It's just, as the building
manager, I hear a lot of things.

651
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:06,189
Mr. Bauer was a
recovering alcoholic.

652
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:10,927
He expressed his disappointment
that his son was still drinking.

653
00:27:10,928 --> 00:27:13,095
Then he threatened to
write him out of his will.

654
00:27:13,096 --> 00:27:14,230
Thank you, Mr. Kuney.

655
00:27:14,231 --> 00:27:16,700
No further questions.

656
00:27:16,701 --> 00:27:18,934
So, just a few questions, sir.

657
00:27:18,935 --> 00:27:19,935
You've been a manager
at the apartments

658
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:20,936
for how long, Mr. Kuney?

659
00:27:20,937 --> 00:27:22,604
Oh, my goodness.

660
00:27:22,605 --> 00:27:25,808
I guess it's been...
six years.

661
00:27:25,809 --> 00:27:27,876
Where has the time gone?

662
00:27:27,877 --> 00:27:29,712
And you recently put new locks

663
00:27:29,713 --> 00:27:30,946
on your apartment
door, didn't you?

664
00:27:30,947 --> 00:27:31,980
Objection.
Relevance.

665
00:27:31,981 --> 00:27:33,549
Your Honor, it is relevant

666
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:35,883
because it's about the recent
burglaries at the apartment.

667
00:27:35,884 --> 00:27:38,152
Counselor,
I've already ruled on that.

668
00:27:38,153 --> 00:27:40,455
I'm sorry, Your Honor.
No harm, no foul.

669
00:27:41,423 --> 00:27:43,090
Excuse me?

670
00:27:43,091 --> 00:27:44,925
I said, "No harm, no foul."

671
00:27:44,926 --> 00:27:46,394
It's a basketball
colloquialism.

672
00:27:46,395 --> 00:27:49,129
Yes, I know what it is.

673
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:51,197
Do you have a problem?

674
00:27:52,734 --> 00:27:54,067
No, I don't,
Your Honor.

675
00:27:54,068 --> 00:27:56,069
My apologies.

676
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:57,704
May I proceed?

677
00:27:57,705 --> 00:28:00,907
If you have something
to say, make a motion.

678
00:28:00,908 --> 00:28:03,844
Don't sneak it
into the record.

679
00:28:03,845 --> 00:28:06,412
Of course, I wanted to work with
Ike, but he's got his minions.

680
00:28:06,413 --> 00:28:08,146
We're having the status meeting
in here today, Peter.

681
00:28:08,147 --> 00:28:10,483
Oh, okay. Hey, listen.
Adam has a great idea

682
00:28:10,484 --> 00:28:11,784
of how we can get some revenue... Hello.

683
00:28:11,785 --> 00:28:13,786
Mother?

684
00:28:13,787 --> 00:28:16,255
Mother.

685
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:17,757
Hi.
Oh.

686
00:28:19,526 --> 00:28:20,826
What's going on?

687
00:28:20,827 --> 00:28:23,428
Jackie just wanted
to come to the status meetings

688
00:28:23,429 --> 00:28:24,662
to keep up
on the campaign.

689
00:28:24,663 --> 00:28:25,864
And you said yes?

690
00:28:25,865 --> 00:28:27,031
I didn't say anything.

691
00:28:27,032 --> 00:28:29,033
I just told her when we
were having the meetings.

692
00:28:29,034 --> 00:28:30,435
All right, well,
tell her she can't.

693
00:28:30,436 --> 00:28:32,203
She doesn't belong here. No.

694
00:28:32,204 --> 00:28:34,606
I'd love to, Peter...
she won't listen to me.

695
00:28:36,108 --> 00:28:37,942
Okay. You'll find

696
00:28:37,943 --> 00:28:39,543
the polling results
on page five.

697
00:28:39,544 --> 00:28:42,546
Oh, is the type too small
for you, Mrs. Florrick?

698
00:28:42,547 --> 00:28:45,215
No. No, this is perfect.
Thank you.

699
00:28:45,216 --> 00:28:47,518
Everybody, please
welcome Jackie.

700
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:50,353
She'll be joining us, when she
can, at our status meetings.

701
00:28:52,857 --> 00:28:55,257
Come on.
Please, ignore me. Please.

702
00:28:58,562 --> 00:29:00,996
There's been a shift.

703
00:29:00,997 --> 00:29:03,666
There was a micro-burst
of sympathy for Mrs. Florrick.

704
00:29:03,667 --> 00:29:06,402
But here's
the interesting thing.

705
00:29:06,403 --> 00:29:09,972
That sympathy has turned
into sympathy for your client.

706
00:29:09,973 --> 00:29:12,874
Good job. I thought he was going
to jump down your throat.

707
00:29:12,875 --> 00:29:14,810
It was your idea.

708
00:29:14,811 --> 00:29:17,813
Okay, so we keep up
the pressure.

709
00:29:17,814 --> 00:29:19,514
One thing I'd like
to point out--

710
00:29:19,515 --> 00:29:21,750
the pack leader on the jury,
juror number three,

711
00:29:21,751 --> 00:29:23,685
the, uh, psychiatrist--

712
00:29:23,686 --> 00:29:27,222
still showing micro-bursts
of contempt toward Mr. Bauer.

713
00:29:27,223 --> 00:29:30,492
So we got a biased judge
and a biased jury.

714
00:29:30,493 --> 00:29:33,895
So we need to have someone
for them to be biased against.

715
00:29:33,896 --> 00:29:37,231
Kalinda, any other
suspects?

716
00:29:39,001 --> 00:29:42,804
Actually, I need to
ask my supervisor.

717
00:29:47,576 --> 00:29:50,544
I need to talk
to you a minute.

718
00:29:50,545 --> 00:29:52,746
I have to catch a plane.

719
00:29:52,747 --> 00:29:55,282
Some last minute details
on the super PAC.

720
00:29:55,283 --> 00:29:57,250
We'll talk later?

721
00:29:57,251 --> 00:29:59,686
No. Now.

722
00:30:03,791 --> 00:30:05,592
Why is Blake
investigating us?

723
00:30:06,527 --> 00:30:08,361
"Us"?

724
00:30:08,362 --> 00:30:10,029
My lawyers.

725
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:11,197
My equity partners.

726
00:30:11,198 --> 00:30:13,533
Because I needed
to know who I was joining.

727
00:30:13,534 --> 00:30:17,335
No. Blake was investigating
even after you joined.

728
00:30:19,238 --> 00:30:21,740
What's going on, partner?

729
00:30:26,513 --> 00:30:29,214
What's going on
is information retrieval.

730
00:30:29,215 --> 00:30:30,415
That's all.

731
00:30:30,416 --> 00:30:31,582
I need information--

732
00:30:31,583 --> 00:30:33,618
some of it relevant,
some of it not--

733
00:30:33,619 --> 00:30:35,520
and I only know
if something is relevant if...

734
00:30:35,521 --> 00:30:38,756
Stop slinging the
New Age speak.

735
00:30:41,393 --> 00:30:44,428
I will ask him
to stop investigating.

736
00:30:46,131 --> 00:30:48,198
Good.

737
00:30:50,735 --> 00:30:55,539
And Kalinda is to be given
a salary bump above Blake's.

738
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:58,342
He is not her
supervisor.

739
00:30:59,944 --> 00:31:01,811
No.

740
00:31:03,114 --> 00:31:06,782
Then we got a problem,
because this is the deal.

741
00:31:08,618 --> 00:31:12,555
Either we bump Kalinda's
salary above Blake's,

742
00:31:12,556 --> 00:31:17,126
or the waters
won't be calmed.

743
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:28,015
This is feeling a bit
like Groundhog Day.

744
00:31:28,016 --> 00:31:29,516
You going to
apologize again?

745
00:31:29,517 --> 00:31:31,784
We've been played.

746
00:31:31,785 --> 00:31:34,087
We had the superior numbers.

747
00:31:34,088 --> 00:31:35,955
We had the votes.

748
00:31:35,956 --> 00:31:38,691
And Bond played us
against each other.

749
00:31:38,692 --> 00:31:41,194
You thought I was plotting
against you; I wasn't.

750
00:31:41,195 --> 00:31:43,029
That's why you're leaving.

751
00:31:45,032 --> 00:31:46,698
We had this
conversation already.

752
00:31:46,699 --> 00:31:48,233
We agreed I wasn't leaving.

753
00:31:48,234 --> 00:31:50,369
Yes, but we were both lying.

754
00:31:55,208 --> 00:31:57,542
I'm listening.

755
00:31:57,543 --> 00:32:00,145
I don't like being played.

756
00:32:00,146 --> 00:32:04,048
So I suggest we do
the same to Bond. How?

757
00:32:04,049 --> 00:32:05,883
In two months time,

758
00:32:05,884 --> 00:32:08,219
he's bringing in
a super PAC as a client--

759
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,987
$100 million.

760
00:32:11,723 --> 00:32:16,093
At that point, Bond intends
to vote you out.

761
00:32:16,094 --> 00:32:18,761
Then he'll have the superior
numbers, and he'll isolate me.

762
00:32:18,762 --> 00:32:21,597
I say we convince him I'm still
on board for that plan,

763
00:32:21,598 --> 00:32:22,932
and in the meantime...

764
00:32:22,933 --> 00:32:24,367
We move against him.

765
00:32:27,738 --> 00:32:29,739
Okay.

766
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:31,741
Okay.

767
00:32:31,742 --> 00:32:34,743
Let's not bicker anymore.

768
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:37,479
<i>The problem is,
there's nobody else.</i>

769
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,614
There's no other way
to get the robbery in.

770
00:32:39,615 --> 00:32:40,949
And there's no suspects.

771
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:42,084
There's no wife, no descendents.

772
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:43,752
No one else cut out of the will.

773
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:46,321
Well, maybe he did it.

774
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:50,091
When did you stop being helpful?

775
00:32:56,765 --> 00:32:59,200
$50,000 a year bump.

776
00:32:59,201 --> 00:33:01,835
And as a thank-you
for your years

777
00:33:01,836 --> 00:33:04,539
of continued service,

778
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:07,174
membership at the St. Andrews
Country Club.

779
00:33:08,109 --> 00:33:09,843
Just what I wanted.

780
00:33:09,844 --> 00:33:12,345
You'll fit right in.

781
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:18,118
I've got your back, Kalinda.

782
00:33:18,119 --> 00:33:20,220
Just make sure you got mine.

783
00:33:20,221 --> 00:33:22,956
I always have...

784
00:33:22,957 --> 00:33:24,523
and I always will.

785
00:33:30,397 --> 00:33:32,465
Oh, um,

786
00:33:32,466 --> 00:33:34,533
tell Alicia to target
the manager.

787
00:33:34,534 --> 00:33:36,970
The manager? Kuney? Why?

788
00:33:36,971 --> 00:33:38,637
His religion.

789
00:33:38,638 --> 00:33:41,873
Like you said, we need to
give the jury someone else

790
00:33:41,874 --> 00:33:43,942
to be biased against.

791
00:33:49,082 --> 00:33:50,749
Oh, my goodness.

792
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:53,151
Oh, you startled me.

793
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:54,486
Eli said you were out.

794
00:33:54,487 --> 00:33:56,087
What are you doing here?

795
00:33:56,088 --> 00:33:58,055
I want to talk to you.

796
00:33:58,056 --> 00:33:59,590
Really? Why?

797
00:34:01,026 --> 00:34:03,060
Mom, you know I love you.

798
00:34:03,061 --> 00:34:06,163
Aw. You're a good son.

799
00:34:06,164 --> 00:34:09,266
But I need you to stop coming
to the status meetings.

800
00:34:09,267 --> 00:34:11,768
Oh?

801
00:34:12,737 --> 00:34:15,404
I need to do this on my own.

802
00:34:18,275 --> 00:34:20,576
Oh, of course. I...

803
00:34:20,577 --> 00:34:22,578
I'm sorry.

804
00:34:22,579 --> 00:34:25,682
No, no, no, please
don't apologize.

805
00:34:25,683 --> 00:34:29,852
I just want you to
understand that... I...

806
00:34:29,853 --> 00:34:32,121
I need to do this on my own.

807
00:34:35,191 --> 00:34:38,360
Is it still all right
if I phone for updates?

808
00:34:38,361 --> 00:34:40,462
Only if it's all
right with Eli.

809
00:34:42,965 --> 00:34:44,966
Of course.

810
00:34:44,967 --> 00:34:46,600
Good.

811
00:34:46,601 --> 00:34:48,870
Thank you.

812
00:35:01,382 --> 00:35:02,883
I'm tempted,

813
00:35:02,884 --> 00:35:05,052
but I need assurances
about the partner track.

814
00:35:05,053 --> 00:35:07,220
I don't want to be
summarily fired again.

815
00:35:08,222 --> 00:35:10,290
I, um...

816
00:35:13,394 --> 00:35:15,494
Things have changed, Cary.

817
00:35:21,968 --> 00:35:24,904
What... what's changed?
My agreeing to join you?

818
00:35:24,905 --> 00:35:28,174
No, it's just, um...
we're a bit more in flux.

819
00:35:28,175 --> 00:35:29,909
Oh, yes.

820
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:31,843
Flux-- that's one
of those great words

821
00:35:31,844 --> 00:35:34,312
that covers a whole
boatload of sins.

822
00:35:38,117 --> 00:35:40,185
Come back to us.

823
00:35:41,253 --> 00:35:43,254
Cary, come back to us.

824
00:35:43,255 --> 00:35:45,590
We made a mistake.

825
00:35:45,591 --> 00:35:47,657
We need you.

826
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,761
At Lockhart/Gardner?

827
00:35:50,762 --> 00:35:52,429
Yes.

828
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:54,431
I don't think so.

829
00:35:54,432 --> 00:35:56,767
I'm having too much fun
where I am.

830
00:35:56,768 --> 00:35:58,368
You sure?

831
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:05,608
What's Alicia's salary?

832
00:36:05,609 --> 00:36:07,610
I don't know exactly,

833
00:36:07,611 --> 00:36:09,445
but I'm sure you
can imagine.

834
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:15,651
Double it,
and put me in above her,

835
00:36:15,652 --> 00:36:17,519
and then I'll come back.

836
00:36:18,455 --> 00:36:20,455
You've grown up.

837
00:36:20,456 --> 00:36:22,724
Oh, yeah, I'm a big boy.

838
00:36:22,725 --> 00:36:24,692
It's good to talk to you.

839
00:36:30,166 --> 00:36:31,967
Good morning.

840
00:36:31,968 --> 00:36:34,035
I hope everybody
had a good evening.

841
00:36:39,741 --> 00:36:43,343
Uh, counselor, are you, uh,
ready for cross?

842
00:36:43,344 --> 00:36:44,845
Yes, Your Honor.

843
00:36:44,846 --> 00:36:46,546
All laced up
and ready to go.

844
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:51,251
Mr. Kuney, you talked

845
00:36:51,252 --> 00:36:53,853
about discussing many things
with the victim.

846
00:36:53,854 --> 00:36:55,388
What were they?

847
00:36:55,389 --> 00:36:57,390
Uh, what did I discuss?

848
00:36:57,391 --> 00:36:58,724
I don't know.

849
00:36:58,725 --> 00:37:00,660
What do managers discuss
with their tenants?

850
00:37:00,661 --> 00:37:01,861
I don't know.

851
00:37:01,862 --> 00:37:03,196
Your religion?

852
00:37:03,197 --> 00:37:04,363
Objection, Your Honor.

853
00:37:04,364 --> 00:37:06,099
I'm just trying to establish

854
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:07,833
Mr. Kuney's familiarity
with the victim.

855
00:37:07,834 --> 00:37:09,501
I'll allow it.

856
00:37:09,502 --> 00:37:11,536
Did you argue

857
00:37:11,537 --> 00:37:13,338
about your religion
with Mr. Bauer?

858
00:37:13,339 --> 00:37:14,840
Well, I wouldn't say argue.

859
00:37:14,841 --> 00:37:18,177
We had, uh,
spirited discussions.

860
00:37:18,178 --> 00:37:19,344
About your Scientology?

861
00:37:19,345 --> 00:37:21,280
Yes. He thought

862
00:37:21,281 --> 00:37:22,947
I was proselytizing.

863
00:37:22,948 --> 00:37:24,615
I thought I was
just discussing

864
00:37:24,616 --> 00:37:26,083
the closed-mindedness

865
00:37:26,084 --> 00:37:29,720
of some countries like
Germany and France

866
00:37:29,721 --> 00:37:33,124
who refuse to recognize
Scientology as a religion.

867
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:35,726
And during these
spirited discussions,

868
00:37:35,727 --> 00:37:38,229
did you discuss Scientology's

869
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:40,230
ambivalence toward psychology?

870
00:37:40,231 --> 00:37:41,397
Objection, Your Honor.

871
00:37:41,398 --> 00:37:42,966
Sustained.

872
00:37:42,967 --> 00:37:44,868
When the two
of you argued--

873
00:37:44,869 --> 00:37:46,569
excuse me-- discussed--

874
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:49,539
these issues, did you do it--

875
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:52,876
according to your neighbors--
with raised voices?

876
00:37:52,877 --> 00:37:54,211
Objection, Your Honor.

877
00:37:54,212 --> 00:37:55,277
Sustained.

878
00:37:55,278 --> 00:37:56,778
You have keys

879
00:37:56,779 --> 00:37:58,714
to Mr. Bauer's apartment,
don't you, Mr. Kuney?

880
00:37:58,715 --> 00:38:00,216
Yes.

881
00:38:00,217 --> 00:38:03,485
And you are the only one
who claimed to see a fight

882
00:38:03,486 --> 00:38:05,888
between our client
and his father.

883
00:38:05,889 --> 00:38:07,223
Objection.

884
00:38:07,224 --> 00:38:08,590
Sustained.
That's enough, counselor.

885
00:38:08,591 --> 00:38:10,692
No further questions,
Your Honor.

886
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,167
How you doing?

887
00:38:27,168 --> 00:38:28,868
All right, hold on, Tom.

888
00:38:28,869 --> 00:38:30,504
Was-was there something
that you needed?

889
00:38:30,505 --> 00:38:32,539
Hey!

890
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:34,541
What...?

891
00:38:34,542 --> 00:38:36,343
Are you nuts?!

892
00:38:36,344 --> 00:38:39,012
That's mine!

893
00:38:39,013 --> 00:38:40,347
Get out.

894
00:38:40,348 --> 00:38:41,947
You are making one big mistake.

895
00:38:41,948 --> 00:38:43,215
Will you escort
Mr. Boras out?

896
00:38:43,216 --> 00:38:44,683
Don't forget
your coat.

897
00:38:50,056 --> 00:38:51,524
Hello.

898
00:38:51,525 --> 00:38:53,526
Oh, yes, Adam?

899
00:38:53,527 --> 00:38:55,594
Oh.

900
00:38:55,595 --> 00:38:56,762
Oh, that's awful.

901
00:38:56,763 --> 00:38:58,863
Oh, you better do it
if that's what...

902
00:38:58,864 --> 00:39:01,199
if that's what Eli wants.

903
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,034
The third quarter has improved.

904
00:39:03,035 --> 00:39:05,270
Although I think
there still needs to be

905
00:39:05,271 --> 00:39:06,638
some belt-tightening.

906
00:39:06,639 --> 00:39:09,207
We still have some
overcharges in litigation.

907
00:39:11,377 --> 00:39:13,377
Hello, Diane.

908
00:39:13,378 --> 00:39:14,611
Derrick.

909
00:39:21,319 --> 00:39:23,086
It's good to
have you back.

910
00:39:23,087 --> 00:39:24,854
It's good to be back.

911
00:39:26,191 --> 00:39:29,559
Anyway, we were discussing
the third quarter results.

912
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:32,395
Uh, they're not as dire
as anticipated, but, uh,

913
00:39:32,396 --> 00:39:34,564
we still have
some overcharges

914
00:39:34,565 --> 00:39:36,399
in litigation. Um,

915
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,933
I think this will be
the focus of what

916
00:39:37,934 --> 00:39:39,202
we're trying to get
accomplished next year.

917
00:39:42,739 --> 00:39:44,940
You seem happy.

918
00:39:44,941 --> 00:39:47,442
Yeah, I guess I am.

919
00:39:47,443 --> 00:39:49,511
Made peace
with yourself?

920
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,414
Jury's in.

921
00:39:52,415 --> 00:39:54,516
You're kidding.
They just went out.

922
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:56,117
Yeah, 20 minutes.

923
00:39:56,118 --> 00:39:57,519
Should be interesting.

924
00:40:14,202 --> 00:40:15,202
It's not guilty.

925
00:40:15,803 --> 00:40:16,803
Are you sure?

926
00:40:16,804 --> 00:40:20,840
Micro-bursts of calm
for Mr. Bauer.

927
00:40:25,713 --> 00:40:27,780
Good job.

928
00:40:47,133 --> 00:40:50,000
Members of the jury,
have you reached a verdict?

929
00:40:50,001 --> 00:40:51,269
We have, Your Honor.

930
00:40:52,237 --> 00:40:54,739
On the charge of
first degree murder,

931
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:56,674
we find the
defendant guilty.

932
00:40:56,675 --> 00:40:58,309
You said...
Don't say a thing.

933
00:40:58,310 --> 00:40:59,810
We'll appeal.

934
00:40:59,811 --> 00:41:01,979
Would the, uh, defense

935
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:03,714
like to poll the jury?

936
00:41:03,715 --> 00:41:06,215
Yes, we would,
Your Honor.

937
00:41:36,846 --> 00:41:38,946
Sir?

938
00:41:38,947 --> 00:41:40,247
Excuse me.

939
00:41:40,248 --> 00:41:41,582
I was with the defense.

940
00:41:41,583 --> 00:41:43,184
Yes, I recognize you.

941
00:41:43,185 --> 00:41:45,620
You don't have to answer
any of my questions,

942
00:41:45,621 --> 00:41:47,855
but it helps us learn
for the future.

943
00:41:47,856 --> 00:41:50,425
No, I'll answer your questions.

944
00:41:50,426 --> 00:41:52,694
It was just such
a quick verdict.

945
00:41:52,695 --> 00:41:56,630
Yes, there were, uh,
no disagreements.

946
00:41:56,631 --> 00:41:58,632
I see.

947
00:41:58,633 --> 00:42:00,300
And what decided it for you?

948
00:42:00,301 --> 00:42:02,135
"What" did?

949
00:42:02,136 --> 00:42:03,470
Yes. I mean, obviously,

950
00:42:03,471 --> 00:42:05,972
you didn't take the manager's
testimony seriously.

951
00:42:05,973 --> 00:42:08,375
And the judge--
did you believe he was biased?

952
00:42:08,376 --> 00:42:09,875
Oh, sure.

953
00:42:09,876 --> 00:42:11,711
You did. But that didn't
enter into your decision?

954
00:42:11,712 --> 00:42:13,212
No.

955
00:42:13,213 --> 00:42:15,614
Why not?

956
00:42:15,615 --> 00:42:16,882
I don't know.

957
00:42:16,883 --> 00:42:18,718
It didn't seem to matter.

958
00:42:18,719 --> 00:42:20,453
Then what did matter?

959
00:42:22,556 --> 00:42:24,623
He did it.

960
00:42:26,091 --> 00:42:28,560
I hope that helps.

961
00:42:28,561 --> 00:42:30,562
Have a good evening.

Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
