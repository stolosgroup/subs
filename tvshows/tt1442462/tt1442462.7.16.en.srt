1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:00:18,166 --> 00:00:20,184
No!

3
00:00:26,659 --> 00:00:28,859
What is this, again?

4
00:00:30,996 --> 00:00:32,530
Roar.

5
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:33,775
Is it real?

6
00:00:33,805 --> 00:00:35,063
Oh, yeah.

7
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:38,806
But the lion bit her.

8
00:00:38,836 --> 00:00:40,565
Yeah, there was, like, 70 injuries

9
00:00:40,595 --> 00:00:42,359
during the making of this.

10
00:00:42,389 --> 00:00:43,612
No!

11
00:00:43,642 --> 00:00:44,759
That's Melanie Griffith right there.

12
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:47,378
She had to get 50 stitches.

13
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:50,781
This is insane. It's
like a... a snuff film.

14
00:00:52,673 --> 00:00:54,585
You are weird.

15
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:03,060
Whose is that?

16
00:01:03,062 --> 00:01:04,067
Mine.

17
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:11,268
So why were you investigating me?

18
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:13,146
Was I investigating you?

19
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:16,040
24 hours of honesty.

20
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,478
I didn't know what I was getting into.

21
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,894
And what were you getting into?

22
00:01:24,924 --> 00:01:25,912
I don't know.

23
00:01:25,942 --> 00:01:28,786
You were a new boss, you
just stole an election.

24
00:01:28,788 --> 00:01:30,321
I didn't steal.

25
00:01:30,323 --> 00:01:32,553
I wanted to make sure you paid me.

26
00:01:32,583 --> 00:01:35,018
Really... you thought
I wouldn't pay you?

27
00:01:35,048 --> 00:01:38,301
Hey, I been screwed
over by a lot of people.

28
00:01:41,233 --> 00:01:42,233
Like who?

29
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:44,142
Hmm?

30
00:01:44,172 --> 00:01:45,722
Who screwed you over?

31
00:01:48,174 --> 00:01:51,166
Oh, people I used to work with.

32
00:01:51,196 --> 00:01:52,296
What people?

33
00:01:55,711 --> 00:01:58,082
I'm not trying to interrogate you.

34
00:01:58,084 --> 00:02:00,511
I'm just trying to have a conversation.

35
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:04,181
I talk, you talk.

36
00:02:05,884 --> 00:02:08,290
Well, my best friend screwed me over

37
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:11,370
and borrowed a bunch of
money, never paid me back.

38
00:02:11,668 --> 00:02:12,997
Oh.

39
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:15,349
I thought you were gonna say a lover.

40
00:02:15,379 --> 00:02:18,181
No. Only money.

41
00:02:18,211 --> 00:02:20,634
Never been screwed over in love.

42
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:28,841
Oh, you feel sorry for me now.

43
00:02:34,707 --> 00:02:36,700
Nice robe.

44
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:38,235
Thanks.

45
00:02:40,635 --> 00:02:42,685
So what's up with your husband?

46
00:02:45,047 --> 00:02:46,997
My husband? What do you mean?

47
00:02:48,134 --> 00:02:51,502
He wouldn't look askance
at me being here with you,

48
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,804
eating pizza in our underwear?

49
00:02:55,989 --> 00:02:57,239
Well, he might.

50
00:02:59,657 --> 00:03:00,778
But we have an arrangement.

51
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,710
Really? How's that work?

52
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,099
He needs me for his career.

53
00:03:04,129 --> 00:03:05,629
I need him for mine.

54
00:03:08,709 --> 00:03:11,409
What, that doesn't
meet with your approval?

55
00:03:14,126 --> 00:03:17,563
I can read the non-verbal
Jason signs now.

56
00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:20,016
One eyebrow up:

57
00:03:20,046 --> 00:03:22,239
"Do you really mean that?"

58
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:26,236
One eyebrow up with a smile:

59
00:03:26,464 --> 00:03:29,373
"That sounds a little
ridiculous, doesn't it?"

60
00:03:29,604 --> 00:03:31,351
Use your words, big man.

61
00:03:41,979 --> 00:03:43,279
What time is it?

62
00:03:43,577 --> 00:03:44,727
I don't know.

63
00:03:45,806 --> 00:03:47,406
Okay, let's just hide.

64
00:03:47,712 --> 00:03:49,326
They'll go away.

65
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:52,842
Alicia, I know you're in there.

66
00:03:52,872 --> 00:03:55,299
We need to talk.

67
00:03:55,645 --> 00:03:56,645
What?

68
00:03:58,065 --> 00:03:59,415
That's my mother.

69
00:04:00,072 --> 00:04:01,072
Okay...

70
00:04:02,267 --> 00:04:03,567
Stay right here.

71
00:04:04,036 --> 00:04:06,242
Don't move. I mean that.

72
00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:10,771
Alicia, open the door.

73
00:04:10,801 --> 00:04:12,518
I'm crying here.

74
00:04:13,807 --> 00:04:15,359
Are you home?

75
00:04:16,555 --> 00:04:19,490
Will you answer me?

76
00:04:20,524 --> 00:04:21,918
What's wrong, Mom?

77
00:04:21,948 --> 00:04:23,260
I'm distraught. What are...

78
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:25,990
Were you sleeping?
It's 3:00 the afternoon.

79
00:04:26,327 --> 00:04:27,327
I know.

80
00:04:28,213 --> 00:04:29,266
I'm tired.

81
00:04:29,268 --> 00:04:30,957
It's Sunday.

82
00:04:30,987 --> 00:04:32,867
That's the day I catch up on sleep.

83
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:35,055
- So let's talk later.
- No, this is for now.

84
00:04:35,085 --> 00:04:36,470
What do you mean, later?

85
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,709
Oh, I called your brother.
He's coming over too.

86
00:04:38,739 --> 00:04:39,989
What? Mom, no.

87
00:04:40,019 --> 00:04:42,456
No, this is about both of your futures.

88
00:04:42,486 --> 00:04:45,575
I'm gonna be dead one day, Alicia. Dead.

89
00:04:45,605 --> 00:04:46,899
Now, would you please open this door...

90
00:04:46,929 --> 00:04:48,424
What the hell is going on?

91
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:50,204
Are you hiding something?

92
00:04:50,307 --> 00:04:51,307
No.

93
00:04:51,992 --> 00:04:53,624
I'm just sleeping.

94
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,292
Well, this'll take a minute.

95
00:04:55,294 --> 00:04:56,245
Okay, so call me.

96
00:04:56,275 --> 00:04:59,727
I did call you. You
weren't answering the phone.

97
00:05:00,645 --> 00:05:02,434
I was Madoffed.

98
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:07,238
What's that chair there?

99
00:05:08,343 --> 00:05:09,965
- I'm painting.
- What, really?

100
00:05:09,995 --> 00:05:11,575
Doesn't smell like it.

101
00:05:11,939 --> 00:05:13,148
Then where were you sleeping?

102
00:05:13,178 --> 00:05:14,945
- Grace's room.
- Where's Grace?

103
00:05:14,947 --> 00:05:17,014
With Peter. Uh, college for the weekend.

104
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:17,982
Mom, let's talk tonight.

105
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,781
Oh, I was robbed, Alicia.

106
00:05:19,811 --> 00:05:21,542
I met this financial advisor.

107
00:05:21,572 --> 00:05:23,964
He was a young guy. Uh,
he reminded me of Ricky...

108
00:05:23,994 --> 00:05:25,493
you know, the Dartmouth
guy you used to date?

109
00:05:25,523 --> 00:05:28,359
And he told me he could double my money.

110
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:29,958
- Oh, God.
- Yeah, that's right,

111
00:05:29,988 --> 00:05:31,162
blame me. I'm the victim,

112
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,464
- so go ahead, blame me.
- Okay, Mom, I will

113
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:35,599
talk to someone at work.
Is the money all gone?

114
00:05:35,601 --> 00:05:37,136
Yes, every cent.

115
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:38,803
- Wait, Mom...
- Oh, come on, I just

116
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:40,850
- want to see the color of the...
- Mom, wait.

117
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,014
Ooh.

118
00:05:42,973 --> 00:05:45,013
- Hi.
- Hi.

119
00:05:45,043 --> 00:05:46,406
This must be the painter.

120
00:05:46,436 --> 00:05:48,586
Can we do this another time now, Mom?

121
00:05:48,616 --> 00:05:50,648
I will talk to David Lee
tomorrow and he'll get into it.

122
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,647
Hi, I'm Veronica.

123
00:05:52,677 --> 00:05:55,193
- Jason.
- Oh, Jason.

124
00:05:55,223 --> 00:05:57,258
- I don't think I know a Jason, do I?
- Mom. Please.

125
00:05:57,288 --> 00:05:59,588
I'm an investigator at Alicia's work.

126
00:05:59,618 --> 00:06:01,565
- Really? What's your last name?
- Okay, we're not having

127
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:03,024
- this conversation...
- Crouse.

128
00:06:03,054 --> 00:06:03,861
Crouse... what kind of name...

129
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,196
- Is that German?
- English.

130
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,497
Uh, but a bit of a mix, though.

131
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:07,571
My Mom is Italian.

132
00:06:07,601 --> 00:06:09,286
Oh, God, the Italians.

133
00:06:09,316 --> 00:06:11,013
The color of Italian skin.

134
00:06:11,043 --> 00:06:13,854
Okay. Okay, you... stop talking.

135
00:06:13,884 --> 00:06:14,672
And you, Mom...

136
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:16,547
Oh, that must be Owen.

137
00:06:16,577 --> 00:06:18,314
Owen, we're in here.

138
00:06:18,344 --> 00:06:19,948
Oh, dear God.

139
00:06:19,978 --> 00:06:21,891
I brought bagels.

140
00:06:23,964 --> 00:06:25,592
Where is everybody?

141
00:06:25,622 --> 00:06:28,094
Owen, I know this is
important, but it's my day off.

142
00:06:28,124 --> 00:06:29,156
Can we do this tomorrow?

143
00:06:29,186 --> 00:06:31,586
Hey, I'm just going where Mom told me.

144
00:06:34,027 --> 00:06:35,027
Stay.

145
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:42,229
That's it. Okay, Mom, let's let
Jason alone for a few minutes.

146
00:06:42,259 --> 00:06:43,968
- Up... Oh.
- Let's talk in the kitchen.

147
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,943
Only if Jason promises to
come join us in the kitchen.

148
00:06:45,973 --> 00:06:47,973
Oh, I promise.

149
00:06:55,815 --> 00:06:58,082
- Alicia has taken a lover.
- I haven't taken...

150
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,817
- What? Who is he?
- Jason.

151
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:02,408
- And investigator. He's amazing.
- Good looking?

152
00:07:02,438 --> 00:07:04,394
Ooh, oh, my God.

153
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,052
Finally she has someone she deserves.

154
00:07:06,082 --> 00:07:07,755
- Mom. Stop.
- I want to see.

155
00:07:07,785 --> 00:07:09,432
- Let me see.
- No, seriously,

156
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:11,952
both of you, stop. This is my life.

157
00:07:11,982 --> 00:07:14,468
- It is not a reality show.
- It's okay, he's getting dressed.

158
00:07:14,498 --> 00:07:15,825
But he's coming out.

159
00:07:15,855 --> 00:07:17,768
- What?
- Of the room,

160
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,742
he's coming out of the room.
God, you have a one-track mind.

161
00:07:20,772 --> 00:07:22,106
Could you please both go in the kitchen?

162
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:23,474
Go. Go, go, go.

163
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:24,839
Shh, stop.

164
00:07:24,869 --> 00:07:25,869
Mm-hmm.

165
00:07:26,692 --> 00:07:28,528
So... how'd you meet him?

166
00:07:28,558 --> 00:07:30,614
At work. He's the investigator.

167
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,716
Oh, my God, that is so sultry,

168
00:07:32,718 --> 00:07:35,021
that is so essence of New Orleans.

169
00:07:35,051 --> 00:07:37,955
Okay, Mom, so what
happened with your scam?

170
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:40,424
Oh, I don't want to talk about it.

171
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:42,246
That's the only reason we're here.

172
00:07:42,276 --> 00:07:44,593
- Well, until about four minutes ago.
- How much did you lose?

173
00:07:44,623 --> 00:07:47,710
- I don't know. About $100,000.
- What? You said $30,000.

174
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,656
Well, look, I didn't ask him to lose it.

175
00:07:49,686 --> 00:07:52,212
He was going to invest
it. And then I get...

176
00:07:52,242 --> 00:07:53,342
this letter.

177
00:07:55,489 --> 00:07:56,813
Gino Davidson?

178
00:07:56,843 --> 00:07:58,366
Yeah, yeah, what's... I
mean, what's wrong with that?

179
00:07:58,396 --> 00:07:59,760
You know, it's very
racist of you to think

180
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:00,836
there's something wrong with that name.

181
00:08:00,866 --> 00:08:02,913
I thought David Lee
was investing for you.

182
00:08:02,915 --> 00:08:05,005
Did he connect you with this guy?

183
00:08:05,035 --> 00:08:06,784
No, not really.

184
00:08:07,813 --> 00:08:09,049
Hey.

185
00:08:10,855 --> 00:08:11,713
Hey.

186
00:08:11,743 --> 00:08:13,090
Didn't I say?

187
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:15,460
Yeah, but I didn't know
how much to believe you.

188
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:18,067
You know, he can hear you, right?

189
00:08:18,357 --> 00:08:21,265
Jason, this is my family.

190
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:23,233
My mother, Veronica,
and my brother, Owen.

191
00:08:23,235 --> 00:08:25,277
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Hm.

192
00:08:25,307 --> 00:08:26,354
I should get going.

193
00:08:26,384 --> 00:08:27,241
- No!
- No!

194
00:08:27,271 --> 00:08:29,707
Have a bagel. We're
hav... we're having bagels.

195
00:08:31,986 --> 00:08:33,177
It is Sunday, right?

196
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,834
Yes. Lot people want to see you, Alicia.

197
00:08:35,864 --> 00:08:36,747
- You're popular.
- Well, Jason

198
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:37,881
has a very busy Sunday...

199
00:08:37,883 --> 00:08:38,983
Oh, no, no, no, no,

200
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:40,117
no, no. He's not leaving

201
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:42,319
without a bagel, are you? Come on.

202
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,664
Sure.

203
00:08:43,694 --> 00:08:45,321
Go get your door, we'll be fine.

204
00:08:49,432 --> 00:08:50,782
We tried calling.

205
00:08:52,966 --> 00:08:55,127
- It's Sunday.
- I know.

206
00:08:55,157 --> 00:08:56,333
This is Mike Tascioni.

207
00:08:56,335 --> 00:08:57,768
And this is Tom.

208
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:59,620
Do you have a little water?

209
00:09:00,109 --> 00:09:01,253
Who is it?

210
00:09:01,283 --> 00:09:03,437
It's not Peter, is it?

211
00:09:03,467 --> 00:09:05,021
That would be awkward.

212
00:09:05,051 --> 00:09:06,310
What is your mother doing here?

213
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:07,562
Nice apartment.

214
00:09:08,405 --> 00:09:09,396
Thanks.

215
00:09:09,426 --> 00:09:11,478
Eli, can we do this...

216
00:09:11,508 --> 00:09:12,784
whatever this is...

217
00:09:12,814 --> 00:09:14,355
- another time?
- I wish we could.

218
00:09:14,385 --> 00:09:15,552
Mike is Peter's new lawyer,

219
00:09:15,554 --> 00:09:17,422
and the grand jury starts tomorrow.

220
00:09:17,452 --> 00:09:19,340
We think you'll be called.
Did you get a subpoena?

221
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:20,658
No. Well, you will.

222
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,159
But we need to ask a favor.

223
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:23,927
We want the grand
jurors to see you there

224
00:09:23,929 --> 00:09:25,629
as they enter and leave.
It'll make a difference

225
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:26,630
if they see your support.

226
00:09:26,632 --> 00:09:28,137
It'll humanize Peter.

227
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:29,847
Who did your interior design?

228
00:09:29,877 --> 00:09:31,508
The colors are really good.

229
00:09:32,126 --> 00:09:33,657
Tascioni?

230
00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:36,440
- Are you...
- Elsbeth's ex-husband.

231
00:09:36,657 --> 00:09:38,108
Yes.

232
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,733
Well, come on in.

233
00:09:41,763 --> 00:09:43,463
- We have bagels.
- Really?

234
00:09:43,493 --> 00:09:44,775
Tom loves bagels.

235
00:09:44,805 --> 00:09:46,517
It's about the orgasm.

236
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:49,158
Naomi Wolf called it the goddess array.

237
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:51,223
- Thanks...
- Mom.

238
00:09:51,718 --> 00:09:52,513
You all right?

239
00:09:52,543 --> 00:09:54,720
- I'm great.
- Oh, hey...

240
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,043
- Jason.
- Eli.

241
00:09:56,073 --> 00:09:57,697
Here we are again.

242
00:09:58,032 --> 00:10:00,082
So why isn't anybody at church?

243
00:10:01,449 --> 00:10:02,799
What do you mean?

244
00:10:03,368 --> 00:10:04,268
It's Sunday.

245
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,520
We're all here.

246
00:10:05,852 --> 00:10:07,252
And not at church.

247
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:11,271
- That's a good point.
- I go to church Sunday nights.

248
00:10:11,301 --> 00:10:13,885
- Really?
- Yeah. Greek Orthodox. Why?

249
00:10:13,915 --> 00:10:15,800
Well, I would imagine that
would come as a surprise

250
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:17,903
to my daughter.

251
00:10:17,933 --> 00:10:20,179
- My money's on Peter.
- Not funny.

252
00:10:20,209 --> 00:10:22,438
Okay. I'll get that.

253
00:10:24,378 --> 00:10:25,439
Alicia Florrick?

254
00:10:25,441 --> 00:10:27,674
Would you believe no?

255
00:10:27,676 --> 00:10:29,309
- You've been served.
- Come on in!

256
00:10:29,311 --> 00:10:32,546
- We've got bagels!
- Okay!

258
00:10:57,026 --> 00:10:59,038
Eli Gold. How are you?

259
00:10:59,068 --> 00:11:01,502
Good. Do I know you?

260
00:11:01,532 --> 00:11:04,306
You don't. Connor Fox. I'm from L.A.

261
00:11:04,308 --> 00:11:06,213
I'm prosecuting your client.

262
00:11:06,671 --> 00:11:09,111
My client? Governor Florrick?

263
00:11:09,389 --> 00:11:11,331
So you're admitting
you are prosecuting him.

264
00:11:11,361 --> 00:11:13,025
Well, I'm here in a grand jury room

265
00:11:13,055 --> 00:11:15,531
with 16 upstanding
citizens thinking about it.

266
00:11:15,561 --> 00:11:17,472
Maybe you'd like to tell
me what you're thinking

267
00:11:17,502 --> 00:11:19,042
of prosecuting him for.

268
00:11:19,072 --> 00:11:20,811
What would be the fun in that?

269
00:11:20,841 --> 00:11:23,075
It's our only element
of surprise, isn't it?

270
00:11:23,077 --> 00:11:26,011
You have to figure out, of
all the dozens of cookie jars

271
00:11:26,013 --> 00:11:29,463
Governor Florrick has his hand
in, which one we've caught.

272
00:11:34,428 --> 00:11:35,187
Hello.

273
00:11:35,217 --> 00:11:37,689
Hello. Mike Tascioni.

274
00:11:38,258 --> 00:11:39,422
And you're...

275
00:11:39,452 --> 00:11:41,152
Peter Florrick's lawyer.

276
00:11:41,387 --> 00:11:42,728
Well, that's an...

277
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:44,330
interesting way to go.

278
00:11:44,965 --> 00:11:45,833
Nice dog.

279
00:11:45,863 --> 00:11:47,466
Thank you. His name is Tom.

280
00:11:47,468 --> 00:11:49,601
Oh. Hello, Tom. Hey, buddy.

281
00:11:49,603 --> 00:11:52,153
- Is he a service dog?
- Yes.

282
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:55,641
Good to know.

283
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:58,610
So, what are we doing here?

284
00:11:58,612 --> 00:12:00,679
Lawyering by loitering?

285
00:12:00,681 --> 00:12:01,681
Yes.

286
00:12:03,135 --> 00:12:03,821
Really?

287
00:12:03,851 --> 00:12:05,684
Yes, since you won't tell
us why you're targeting

288
00:12:05,686 --> 00:12:07,224
the governor, we're going
to question the witnesses

289
00:12:07,254 --> 00:12:08,504
as they leave.

290
00:12:08,534 --> 00:12:10,184
They won't talk to you.

291
00:12:10,509 --> 00:12:13,859
Then we'll time the duration
of each witness' questioning

292
00:12:13,861 --> 00:12:16,785
to determine which witnesses you're
bringing as smoke screens and...

293
00:12:16,815 --> 00:12:18,870
- which go to the heart of the case.
- Mike, Mike, I don't think

294
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,548
- it's a good idea to...
- And why won't I just stretch out

295
00:12:20,578 --> 00:12:22,147
the amount of time I
question the smoke screens?

296
00:12:22,177 --> 00:12:23,753
Because you can't. Try stretching out

297
00:12:23,783 --> 00:12:26,264
ten minutes' worth of
questions to one hour.

298
00:12:26,698 --> 00:12:28,638
- Seems doable.
- Yes, if you don't mind

299
00:12:28,668 --> 00:12:32,210
angering your grand jury
by wasting their time.

300
00:12:33,614 --> 00:12:35,096
Hello, Mrs. Florrick.

301
00:12:35,126 --> 00:12:37,049
- Hello.
- I didn't think your subpoena

302
00:12:37,051 --> 00:12:38,391
- was for today.
- It isn't.

303
00:12:38,421 --> 00:12:41,987
We wanted your jurors to see her
out here supporting her husband.

304
00:12:43,037 --> 00:12:45,314
Well, that is a strategy. Oh!

305
00:12:45,344 --> 00:12:47,228
And here they come.

306
00:12:48,693 --> 00:12:50,443
Thanks. Come on in, guys.

307
00:12:51,838 --> 00:12:54,167
You sure you don't mind being
here all day, Mrs. Florrick,

308
00:12:54,197 --> 00:12:55,932
to support your husband?

309
00:12:55,962 --> 00:12:58,403
No, not at all.

310
00:13:00,908 --> 00:13:02,874
It's not gonna make a difference.

311
00:13:04,628 --> 00:13:06,615
Hello? David, yes.

312
00:13:06,645 --> 00:13:08,924
- Is my mother there?
- Hi, Alicia. I'm here.

313
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:11,491
We've already discussed
that Veronica made a mistake

314
00:13:11,521 --> 00:13:12,564
going out on her own

315
00:13:12,594 --> 00:13:15,203
- with this investment.
- Yes, I've been properly spanked.

316
00:13:17,078 --> 00:13:18,153
And I'm asking

317
00:13:18,183 --> 00:13:22,377
our investigator to step in to
look into this investor's scam.

318
00:13:22,379 --> 00:13:24,513
Ooh, the investigator.

319
00:13:24,515 --> 00:13:26,848
Okay. I'll be right back.

320
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,361
Hey, Mom?

321
00:13:30,391 --> 00:13:32,549
- Did David just step out?
- Yes, he did.

322
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:35,157
- Owen's here.
- Owen? Why is Owen there?

323
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:37,092
Uh, because I'm supposedly good at math.

324
00:13:37,094 --> 00:13:38,427
Yes, everyone blames me.

325
00:13:38,429 --> 00:13:40,896
- I guess I need a minder now.
- Moi.

326
00:13:40,898 --> 00:13:43,598
Okay, look, guys, I don't want my...

327
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,734
workmates to know
about my personal life,

328
00:13:45,736 --> 00:13:48,458
so can we not mention Jason at my house?

329
00:13:48,488 --> 00:13:50,276
Alicia, please, I'm not a dummy.

330
00:13:50,306 --> 00:13:53,306
We already discussed it.
Oh, here-here he is now.

331
00:13:54,392 --> 00:13:56,311
Ah. This must be our investigator.

332
00:13:56,313 --> 00:13:57,929
Hey, Jason.

333
00:13:59,734 --> 00:14:02,863
- Hi.
- Alicia just, uh, told us

334
00:14:02,893 --> 00:14:04,996
your name, Jason. Wasn't
that right, Alicia?

335
00:14:05,026 --> 00:14:06,927
- Yes.
- Hello.

336
00:14:06,957 --> 00:14:08,990
You've been the victim
of a pyramid scheme?

337
00:14:08,992 --> 00:14:10,028
- Is that Alicia?
- Yes.

338
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:12,241
- We should talk to her now.
- Mmm.

339
00:14:12,271 --> 00:14:14,080
Alicia, do you mind?

340
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:17,460
Uh, we have to talk to you
a minute about firm business.

341
00:14:18,687 --> 00:14:19,687
Okay.

342
00:14:22,054 --> 00:14:23,854
What are you doing? Your office.

343
00:14:23,884 --> 00:14:26,408
- No, your office.
- Diane will see us in my office.

344
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:28,360
Yes. And that's what we want.

345
00:14:30,905 --> 00:14:34,382
Alicia, we're worried Diane is
making a power play for the firm.

346
00:14:34,384 --> 00:14:36,318
Yes, I've heard about
your concern, Cary,

347
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,487
- but I think it's just paranoia.
- Diane hasn't

348
00:14:38,489 --> 00:14:39,662
reached out to you to join her?

349
00:14:39,692 --> 00:14:42,273
- Join her in what?
- In an all-female partnership.

350
00:14:42,303 --> 00:14:45,060
Look, you're the one who
brought me into the firm, Cary.

351
00:14:45,062 --> 00:14:46,928
I'm a nonequity partner.
I don't mean anything.

352
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:48,171
It's not about your position.

353
00:14:48,201 --> 00:14:50,398
It's about your connections
and your last name.

354
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,334
We think that Diane might try to use you

355
00:14:52,336 --> 00:14:53,671
as a lure to female-leaning clients.

356
00:14:53,701 --> 00:14:55,701
- Are you hearing this from Diane?
- No.

357
00:14:55,731 --> 00:14:57,839
We're hearing it from clients.

358
00:14:58,514 --> 00:15:00,173
And you're not denying it.

359
00:15:00,203 --> 00:15:01,514
Then I'm denying it.

360
00:15:01,544 --> 00:15:04,050
Diane hasn't approached me.

361
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,735
She's lying.

362
00:15:05,765 --> 00:15:07,037
Then what do we do?

363
00:15:07,067 --> 00:15:08,600
Put her on the hot seat.

364
00:15:08,781 --> 00:15:12,103
Tell her if Diane approaches
her, she has to talk to us.

365
00:15:12,105 --> 00:15:13,205
Still there?

366
00:15:24,868 --> 00:15:27,691
Okay, but she hasn't approached me.

367
00:15:31,212 --> 00:15:34,000
Okay, guys, uh, I have to go. But, yes,

368
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:36,630
I'll let you know if
Diane approaches me.

369
00:15:37,897 --> 00:15:39,132
Eli.

370
00:15:45,079 --> 00:15:46,844
Don't tell me you made a deal.

371
00:15:46,874 --> 00:15:47,986
Alicia, hello.

372
00:15:48,016 --> 00:15:49,398
- Ruth.
- You made a deal.

373
00:15:49,428 --> 00:15:51,550
- Eli, this isn't the place.
- Oh, yes, this is the place.

374
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:52,998
This is exactly the place.

375
00:15:53,028 --> 00:15:54,838
Do you know what this
does to my rיsumי?

376
00:15:54,868 --> 00:15:58,350
I'm being subpoenaed.
The last thing I need

377
00:15:58,352 --> 00:16:00,071
is to be testifying against a client.

378
00:16:00,101 --> 00:16:02,612
- Which is what you're doing?
- I'm answering questions, Eli.

379
00:16:02,642 --> 00:16:05,219
Same as you. Same as anyone.

380
00:16:05,249 --> 00:16:06,648
Hi.

381
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:08,417
Mike Tascioni.

382
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:09,864
And this is Tom.

383
00:16:09,894 --> 00:16:11,529
Hello.

384
00:16:11,559 --> 00:16:13,431
Uh-oh.

385
00:16:13,433 --> 00:16:14,733
She made a deal.

386
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,335
I didn't make a deal.

387
00:16:17,337 --> 00:16:19,237
We're ready for you, Ms. Eastman.

388
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:22,374
You testify against Peter, no
one will ever hire you again

389
00:16:22,376 --> 00:16:23,676
and you know it.

390
00:16:28,672 --> 00:16:29,701
How can she hurt us?

391
00:16:29,731 --> 00:16:31,995
In ways I can't even imagine.

392
00:16:36,512 --> 00:16:37,501
Who is it?

393
00:16:37,531 --> 00:16:40,564
I'm looking for Gino Davidson.

394
00:16:40,594 --> 00:16:41,794
Hey. I'm Gino.

395
00:16:44,312 --> 00:16:46,462
Should I know what this is about?

396
00:16:46,685 --> 00:16:49,167
Does the name Veronica Loy ring a bell?

397
00:16:49,369 --> 00:16:50,942
Oh, geez...

398
00:16:52,554 --> 00:16:54,037
I like Veronica.

399
00:16:54,067 --> 00:16:56,119
She always sat in the
front row of my class.

400
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:58,366
- What class?
- Fire Cycle.

401
00:16:58,396 --> 00:17:00,400
I teach Monday,
Wednesdays, and some Fridays

402
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:02,229
to pay the rent, while
I day-trade and study up

403
00:17:02,259 --> 00:17:04,805
- for my Series 7.
- So you day-traded away Veronica's

404
00:17:04,835 --> 00:17:08,275
- $100,000?
- No. Is that what she told you?

405
00:17:08,305 --> 00:17:11,640
No. She told me you
promised to double her money.

406
00:17:11,642 --> 00:17:14,042
No way, man. I did the
opposite of promise her.

407
00:17:14,044 --> 00:17:16,305
I told her it was a
high risk investment.

408
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:18,280
- What was?
- I have a cousin that got in early

409
00:17:18,282 --> 00:17:20,521
on riverboat casinos, made a killing.

410
00:17:20,551 --> 00:17:22,802
So when he told me he was
gonna do a second round,

411
00:17:22,832 --> 00:17:24,519
I put a little of my own money in.

412
00:17:24,521 --> 00:17:25,947
Risk capital. Part of a...

413
00:17:25,977 --> 00:17:27,923
smart asset allocation.

414
00:17:27,925 --> 00:17:29,958
I mentioned it to Veronica.
She said she wanted in.

415
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,316
- But that didn't pan out?
- Let's just say I'm not gonna

416
00:17:32,346 --> 00:17:35,047
be hanging up my bike
shorts anytime soon.

417
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:39,180
I was very clear with Veronica
about what she was getting into.

418
00:17:40,012 --> 00:17:42,112
Look, I'm telling you the truth.

419
00:17:44,775 --> 00:17:47,926
Hey. I'm sorry you got
saddled with all of this.

420
00:17:47,928 --> 00:17:49,995
Uh, it's all right. But
this guy seems to be telling

421
00:17:49,997 --> 00:17:51,563
the truth. He's an idiot

422
00:17:51,565 --> 00:17:54,099
- but not necessarily a con man.
- So you're asking

423
00:17:54,101 --> 00:17:57,569
if my mother is dumb enough
to give $100,000 to an idiot?

424
00:17:57,571 --> 00:17:59,519
Not dumb enough. Just whether...

425
00:17:59,549 --> 00:18:02,107
- Yes, well, she is.
- All right, well,

426
00:18:02,109 --> 00:18:04,958
I-I don't really think
there's an issue here then.

427
00:18:04,988 --> 00:18:06,566
It's not a Madoff situation.

428
00:18:06,596 --> 00:18:08,430
It's just a bad investment.

429
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:09,981
Okay. I'll talk to my mom.

430
00:18:09,983 --> 00:18:11,583
No, don't worry about it. You know what,

431
00:18:11,585 --> 00:18:13,985
I got to tell David
Lee, so I'll talk to her.

432
00:18:13,987 --> 00:18:16,537
- How are you doing, by the way?
- Good.

433
00:18:16,856 --> 00:18:18,356
Wait, which subject?

434
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:20,330
Our lost weekend.

435
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:21,970
Good.

436
00:18:22,566 --> 00:18:24,231
I needed to clear my head.

437
00:18:24,261 --> 00:18:26,255
And we didn't even drink.

438
00:18:26,285 --> 00:18:27,916
We didn't.

439
00:18:27,946 --> 00:18:30,235
Sex is a good replacement for tequila.

440
00:18:30,237 --> 00:18:32,496
It can be.

441
00:18:32,526 --> 00:18:34,100
I wish you were here right now.

442
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:35,158
Where's "here"?

443
00:18:35,188 --> 00:18:36,863
Handicapped bathroom
in the federal building.

444
00:18:38,522 --> 00:18:40,350
You know, I think I
wrote a Penthouse letter

445
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:42,589
about something like that.

446
00:18:42,619 --> 00:18:45,135
Okay. I'd better go. Take care.

447
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:46,894
An example of what you mean by that.

448
00:18:46,924 --> 00:18:48,353
They're not clean and pure.

449
00:18:48,355 --> 00:18:51,490
No one is suggesting
Governor Florrick is pure.

450
00:18:51,492 --> 00:18:53,058
I did my due diligence

451
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:55,523
before joining. That wasn't surprising.

452
00:18:55,553 --> 00:18:57,162
Perhaps not to you.

453
00:18:57,192 --> 00:18:58,897
A grand jury might be surprised to learn

454
00:18:58,899 --> 00:19:00,961
some of these things
about Governor Florrick.

455
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:03,056
What things about Governor Florrick?

456
00:19:03,086 --> 00:19:06,104
Let's turn to the events
of November. You were...

457
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:17,438
Uh,

458
00:19:17,468 --> 00:19:18,800
I...

459
00:19:19,293 --> 00:19:20,702
Eli, can I talk to you for a minute?

460
00:19:20,704 --> 00:19:22,722
- Sure.
- Do you mind?

461
00:19:26,535 --> 00:19:27,524
- I'm a lawyer.
- Mmm.

462
00:19:27,554 --> 00:19:29,117
- And Mike is a lawyer.
- Mmm.

463
00:19:29,147 --> 00:19:33,504
I can't get too involved in... this.

464
00:19:33,534 --> 00:19:35,283
Wh-What is this?

465
00:19:36,641 --> 00:19:39,354
Uh... Alicia...

466
00:19:43,417 --> 00:19:45,193
- Alicia, this is...
- Shut up.

467
00:19:47,162 --> 00:19:48,230
I think bringing me in

468
00:19:48,232 --> 00:19:50,199
implies something very smart about...

469
00:19:50,229 --> 00:19:52,109
- Is this the grand jury?
- I can't say anything.

470
00:19:52,139 --> 00:19:53,835
I'm a lawyer, and I've been subpoenaed.

471
00:19:53,837 --> 00:19:56,138
- But I am hearing the grand jury room?
- You found this

472
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:58,540
on your own. It's not
illegal for you to listen.

473
00:19:58,542 --> 00:20:00,092
It is illegal for me.

474
00:20:00,646 --> 00:20:01,843
Oh, my God, you're great.

475
00:20:01,845 --> 00:20:03,029
Good-bye.

476
00:20:08,585 --> 00:20:10,218
Eli Gold, bless his heart...

477
00:20:12,957 --> 00:20:16,391
Now is the time to put it in the...

478
00:20:16,393 --> 00:20:18,226
No, no, can't.

479
00:20:18,228 --> 00:20:19,895
All right, so put it over there, huh?

480
00:20:19,897 --> 00:20:21,087
Yeah, we got a lot of work to do.

481
00:20:21,117 --> 00:20:22,931
How many of these things
do we got to do...?

482
00:20:23,264 --> 00:20:24,640
We got to fix that...

483
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:26,970
Might have acquired a
quick infusion of cash.

484
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:27,941
He did.

485
00:20:27,971 --> 00:20:30,238
And did Lloyd Garber provide that money?

486
00:20:30,709 --> 00:20:33,295
He bundled it for us, yes.

487
00:20:33,325 --> 00:20:36,362
And you had struggles with
Eli Gold, too, didn't you?

488
00:20:36,392 --> 00:20:38,547
Eli Gold had some issues with me

489
00:20:38,549 --> 00:20:40,849
because I replaced him
as campaign manager.

490
00:20:40,851 --> 00:20:43,651
Well, let's talk about
Eli Gold for a second.

491
00:20:54,498 --> 00:20:56,985
Candidates don't come into
your life like newborn babies.

492
00:20:57,015 --> 00:20:59,691
They're not clean and pure.
Certainly not Peter Florrick.

493
00:20:59,693 --> 00:21:01,159
My question was

494
00:21:01,161 --> 00:21:04,400
whether you ever heard him
agree to a quid pro quo.

495
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:05,600
Every candidate

496
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:08,088
gets asked favors.
Comes with the territory.

497
00:21:08,118 --> 00:21:11,169
But I never saw or heard
Governor Florrick cross a line.

498
00:21:26,788 --> 00:21:28,011
Good Lord.

499
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:29,518
Thank you, Ms. Eastman.

500
00:21:29,548 --> 00:21:32,596
Let's turn to the question of donuts.

501
00:21:32,626 --> 00:21:34,195
Okay. Which one?

502
00:21:34,225 --> 00:21:35,426
Lloyd Garber.

503
00:21:35,428 --> 00:21:37,597
He was one of Governor
Florrick's top donors, yes?

504
00:21:37,627 --> 00:21:38,440
Yes, that is true.

505
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:41,533
In fact, wasn't Lloyd Garber
the single largest donor

506
00:21:41,535 --> 00:21:43,559
to Governor Florrick's
presidential campaign?

507
00:21:43,589 --> 00:21:45,610
Yes, he donated money,

508
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,705
- organized fund-raisers.
- And they had

509
00:21:47,707 --> 00:21:49,541
conversations you weren't privy to?

510
00:21:49,543 --> 00:21:51,976
Of course. Donors on that level

511
00:21:51,978 --> 00:21:53,398
get a lot of access.

512
00:21:53,428 --> 00:21:56,451
Did Governor Florrick ever
mention a falling out or

513
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:58,929
a period of friction?

514
00:21:58,959 --> 00:22:01,545
With Mr. Garber? No.

515
00:22:01,575 --> 00:22:03,507
- Did Mr. Garber mention it?
- No.

516
00:22:03,537 --> 00:22:04,532
Just to be clear,

517
00:22:04,562 --> 00:22:08,428
he never mentioned any trouble in 2012?

518
00:22:09,204 --> 00:22:10,355
I never heard of any.

519
00:22:10,385 --> 00:22:11,362
He didn't mention Peter

520
00:22:11,364 --> 00:22:13,580
prosecuting his illegitimate...

521
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:16,095
That would be no. I don't
know anything about that.

522
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:18,503
Uh-huh. But you would
expect that situation

523
00:22:18,505 --> 00:22:21,702
to drive a wedge between Mr.
Garber and Governor Florrick.

524
00:22:21,732 --> 00:22:23,474
He wasn't Governor
Florrick at that time.

525
00:22:23,476 --> 00:22:25,536
Yes, of course. State's
Attorney Florrick.

526
00:22:25,566 --> 00:22:27,124
You would expect
support to be cut off...

527
00:22:28,048 --> 00:22:29,306
but it wasn't.

528
00:22:29,336 --> 00:22:32,271
In fact, Mr. Garber started
bundling even larger amounts.

529
00:22:35,747 --> 00:22:37,847
It's occupied! Try the next one!

530
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:40,792
Oh.

531
00:22:46,567 --> 00:22:47,567
Damn it!

532
00:22:56,561 --> 00:22:57,713
Okay, I have something to tell you,

533
00:22:57,743 --> 00:22:59,510
- and I can't tell you how I know it.
- Why?

534
00:22:59,512 --> 00:23:00,513
- I just can't.
- Why?

535
00:23:00,543 --> 00:23:01,713
Mike!

536
00:23:02,402 --> 00:23:05,282
You're both lawyers, I'm not,
but it is my understanding

537
00:23:05,284 --> 00:23:07,351
that what they're
discussing in that room

538
00:23:07,353 --> 00:23:09,820
is an event that took place in 2012.

539
00:23:10,226 --> 00:23:11,249
That's very specific.

540
00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:13,614
- What event in 2012?
- I'm not sure, but I know

541
00:23:13,644 --> 00:23:15,798
it has to do with Lloyd Garber.

542
00:23:16,354 --> 00:23:17,728
So we think this is about

543
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,930
corrupt fund-raising practices?

544
00:23:24,476 --> 00:23:25,476
Yes.

545
00:23:26,164 --> 00:23:27,942
- Is there anything there?
- I don't know.

546
00:23:27,972 --> 00:23:31,375
I know what I did. I...
don't know what Peter did.

547
00:23:31,571 --> 00:23:33,177
Mrs. Florrick?

548
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:34,824
I don't know. You'd
have to talk to Peter.

549
00:23:34,854 --> 00:23:38,054
And we have no hint as to
what this event is in 2012?

550
00:23:39,485 --> 00:23:41,518
Well, maybe you can

551
00:23:41,548 --> 00:23:43,711
go and find out more, Eli.

552
00:23:43,741 --> 00:23:47,091
Oh, right. Uh, yes.

553
00:23:54,151 --> 00:23:57,568
Think there's something here
that I don't want to know about?

554
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:59,522
I think you might be right.

555
00:23:59,552 --> 00:24:02,452
Is it illegal or unethical?

556
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:04,842
I... don't know anymore.

557
00:24:05,292 --> 00:24:06,496
Mrs. Florrick.

558
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:09,837
Oh, Mister... Is it still "Hlavin?"

559
00:24:09,867 --> 00:24:11,308
Sure. Just to keep things easy.

560
00:24:11,338 --> 00:24:14,873
Mr. Hlavin. And are we admitting
we're an FBI agent today?

561
00:24:14,903 --> 00:24:16,787
- Why not?
- Mr. Tascioni,

562
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:19,290
this is Roland Hlavin. He's an FBI agent

563
00:24:19,292 --> 00:24:20,977
who keeps things interesting.

564
00:24:21,007 --> 00:24:21,854
Nice to meet you.

565
00:24:21,884 --> 00:24:23,530
I guess you're the next witness.

566
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,783
I think I am.

567
00:24:24,813 --> 00:24:26,971
And do you know what this is all about?

568
00:24:27,001 --> 00:24:29,477
I think it's a grand jury investigation.

569
00:24:29,507 --> 00:24:32,169
And it's focusing on 2012?

570
00:24:34,557 --> 00:24:35,539
What?

571
00:24:35,541 --> 00:24:39,643
2012. That's what this is about, right?

572
00:24:41,171 --> 00:24:42,671
What are you talking about?

573
00:24:42,701 --> 00:24:44,947
The events in 2012 with Lloyd Garber.

574
00:24:44,977 --> 00:24:47,559
It was completely innocent.

575
00:24:48,035 --> 00:24:51,014
Who told you this has
anything to do with 2012?

576
00:24:51,044 --> 00:24:52,764
Where'd you hear that?
Did Connor say something?

577
00:24:52,794 --> 00:24:54,945
He did. And you should
tell him that we're prepared

578
00:24:54,975 --> 00:24:56,710
to show that this is a witch hunt?

579
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:58,040
Even the payoff?

580
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:01,159
Yes, even the payoff.

581
00:25:01,189 --> 00:25:03,667
Okay, great. Bring your worst.

582
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:05,607
Nice to meet you.

583
00:25:12,321 --> 00:25:13,803
Nicely done.

584
00:25:14,368 --> 00:25:15,956
Is there a payoff?

585
00:25:17,308 --> 00:25:18,282
I have no idea.

586
00:25:18,284 --> 00:25:20,417
You'll need to refute
it in your testimony.

587
00:25:30,473 --> 00:25:32,329
What is Eli doing?

588
00:25:32,331 --> 00:25:34,017
We have to get an investigator on this.

589
00:25:34,047 --> 00:25:36,997
That would be good. Do
you have someone in mind?

590
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:42,139
Unfortunately, you
weren't cheated, Veronica.

591
00:25:42,141 --> 00:25:44,341
- Says him.
- Yes, but also,

592
00:25:44,343 --> 00:25:45,978
- those papers that you signed.
- But if I was cheated,

593
00:25:46,008 --> 00:25:47,090
those papers shouldn't count.

594
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,179
- You weren't cheated, Mom.
- I was.

595
00:25:49,181 --> 00:25:51,048
I mean, they make the
print so small, and they

596
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:52,098
trick you with the language.

597
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:53,404
And I mean, who reads all that?

598
00:25:53,434 --> 00:25:55,941
You invested in a riverboat casino?

599
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:58,022
He said that the only person

600
00:25:58,024 --> 00:25:59,783
who comes out ahead in gambling

601
00:25:59,813 --> 00:26:00,963
is the house.

602
00:26:04,252 --> 00:26:05,840
You don't believe me, do you?

603
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:09,140
- But he cheated me.
- This is just like that last time, Mom.

604
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:11,893
That guy who got you to give
him your Social Security number?

605
00:26:11,923 --> 00:26:13,605
He said you were in trouble.

606
00:26:13,635 --> 00:26:15,581
I couldn't get a hold of you.

607
00:26:15,611 --> 00:26:16,852
So the money's gone?

608
00:26:16,882 --> 00:26:19,393
Well, pretty much. You still
have some investment money.

609
00:26:19,423 --> 00:26:21,422
Not enough to pay off Mom's mortgage?

610
00:26:21,452 --> 00:26:24,034
- We'll see.
- I did nothing wrong here.

611
00:26:24,064 --> 00:26:25,264
I was cheated.

612
00:26:29,762 --> 00:26:31,989
This other guy that got her
Social Security number...

613
00:26:32,019 --> 00:26:32,889
when was that?

614
00:26:32,919 --> 00:26:34,960
Last year. We worked it
out. He never got any money.

615
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:37,761
- Do you remember the month?
- Why?

616
00:26:38,516 --> 00:26:39,928
I need to check out something.

617
00:26:39,958 --> 00:26:41,763
Is it something that
will get her money back?

618
00:26:41,793 --> 00:26:42,981
I don't know.

619
00:26:43,011 --> 00:26:45,703
February? Around my birthday.

620
00:26:49,809 --> 00:26:51,801
- Hey.
- Hi.

621
00:26:51,831 --> 00:26:53,610
I was just coming to talk to you.

622
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:55,646
- Where you going?
- To find your mother.

623
00:26:55,648 --> 00:26:58,382
Okay, not what I expected.

624
00:26:58,412 --> 00:27:00,512
- Do you have a minute?
- Yeah.

625
00:27:05,694 --> 00:27:10,761
Would you be offended if I said
I want to take you right now?

626
00:27:12,403 --> 00:27:13,403
No.

627
00:27:18,148 --> 00:27:19,570
So, anyway,

628
00:27:19,572 --> 00:27:22,148
um, are you still freelance?

629
00:27:22,178 --> 00:27:24,513
I am. What do you need?

630
00:27:24,543 --> 00:27:25,843
It's not for me.

631
00:27:27,947 --> 00:27:30,247
I hope this isn't too weird for you.

632
00:27:30,703 --> 00:27:32,303
It's for your husband.

633
00:27:33,059 --> 00:27:34,485
How did you know?

634
00:27:34,487 --> 00:27:36,655
That look on your face.

635
00:27:37,449 --> 00:27:40,030
Well, we think this grand jury
investigation is about something

636
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:43,661
that happened in 2012
involving Lloyd Garber.

637
00:27:43,663 --> 00:27:45,462
That's all we know.

638
00:27:45,464 --> 00:27:47,031
Can you find out more?

639
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:48,916
I can try.

640
00:27:48,946 --> 00:27:50,768
And this is okay with you?

641
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,970
It's just work.

642
00:27:53,951 --> 00:27:55,406
Hey, and what's going on with my mom?

643
00:27:55,408 --> 00:27:57,574
- I thought that was over.
- It was.

644
00:27:57,576 --> 00:28:00,918
But I just found out
she's on the sucker's list.

645
00:28:00,948 --> 00:28:03,040
It's a list of people
that have fallen for scams.

646
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:05,349
Con men trade and sell them.

647
00:28:05,351 --> 00:28:07,384
So, she was cheated?

648
00:28:07,414 --> 00:28:08,401
It's possible,

649
00:28:08,431 --> 00:28:10,219
but the con man covered his tracks,

650
00:28:10,249 --> 00:28:13,557
so, we have to create new ones.

651
00:28:14,177 --> 00:28:15,359
Hmm.

652
00:28:15,361 --> 00:28:16,361
Uh.

653
00:28:32,907 --> 00:28:35,145
Here, let me help you.

654
00:28:41,253 --> 00:28:42,953
Oh, God.

655
00:28:46,884 --> 00:28:48,286
Okay, I'd like to turn...

656
00:28:48,316 --> 00:28:49,269
Strike that.

657
00:28:49,299 --> 00:28:50,910
Was there a task force in place

658
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:53,569
- to investigate Governor Florrick?
- No. This began

659
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:55,299
as an investigation into corruption

660
00:28:55,301 --> 00:28:57,150
in the Cook County judiciary.

661
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,308
Well, without compromising

662
00:28:58,338 --> 00:28:59,837
your other investigation,

663
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:02,402
tell us what turned your
attention to Governor Florrick.

664
00:29:02,432 --> 00:29:05,418
Well, it started as a chance
comment by an informant.

665
00:29:05,448 --> 00:29:06,821
And what was that?

666
00:29:06,851 --> 00:29:08,809
We were working undercover at the time

667
00:29:08,839 --> 00:29:09,861
when a judge we had turned
told us about a case...

668
00:29:09,891 --> 00:29:12,389
Hey, what are they doing
with the drywall here?

669
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:13,896
What'd you say?

670
00:29:14,161 --> 00:29:15,219
What are they doing
with the drywall here?

671
00:29:15,221 --> 00:29:17,937
I don't know. They haven't
said anything about it.

672
00:29:17,967 --> 00:29:20,296
- What do we do? Just leave it?
- I would.

673
00:29:20,326 --> 00:29:22,059
They always get pissed
if we think for ourselves.

674
00:29:22,061 --> 00:29:25,185
I know, but check this out.

675
00:29:25,485 --> 00:29:28,044
And in this context, what
does "certain" mean?

676
00:29:28,074 --> 00:29:30,634
Well, you can't just
go on the testimony of

677
00:29:30,636 --> 00:29:31,689
one guy you've already rolled up.

678
00:29:31,719 --> 00:29:33,738
What about this? Huh? What about this?

679
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:35,172
Hey, hold on a second!

680
00:29:35,174 --> 00:29:37,074
- Hold on a second!
- Oh, come on. Come on!

681
00:29:37,076 --> 00:29:38,542
Wait. What?

682
00:29:38,544 --> 00:29:40,311
I'm not sure if this is the right wall.

683
00:29:40,313 --> 00:29:42,213
- Are we on the right wall here?
- V-Lock.

684
00:29:42,215 --> 00:29:44,315
He's gonna take another ten hours...

685
00:29:44,317 --> 00:29:47,962
Are you certain that was
a result of corruption?

686
00:29:47,992 --> 00:29:49,434
Governor Florrick
committed a crime then?

687
00:29:49,464 --> 00:29:51,689
Yes. It's extremely unlikely

688
00:29:51,691 --> 00:29:54,892
it was a coincidence. That's
not how politics works,

689
00:29:54,922 --> 00:29:56,193
- not how Chicago works.
- No, no.

690
00:29:56,195 --> 00:29:57,928
- This is the right wall.
- Are you sure?

691
00:29:57,930 --> 00:30:00,898
Yeah.

692
00:30:11,381 --> 00:30:13,198
It's about V-Lock.

693
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:14,211
- V...?
- Lock.

694
00:30:14,213 --> 00:30:16,467
This investigation is about V-Lock.

695
00:30:16,497 --> 00:30:17,843
What's V-Lock?

696
00:30:17,873 --> 00:30:19,502
I have no idea.

697
00:30:27,218 --> 00:30:29,816
Sorry, I wish I could help,
but just don't know how.

698
00:30:29,846 --> 00:30:31,451
Give my mom her money back.

699
00:30:31,481 --> 00:30:33,886
I lost $80,000 myself.

700
00:30:33,916 --> 00:30:35,121
It was everything that I saved.

701
00:30:35,151 --> 00:30:36,889
You lost her $100,000.

702
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:38,091
It wasn't even hers to invest.

703
00:30:38,121 --> 00:30:39,487
Owen, he already told me.

704
00:30:39,489 --> 00:30:40,788
Mom, I don't care what he told you...

705
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:42,252
It was a risky investment.

706
00:30:42,282 --> 00:30:43,844
- I told her.
- Owen, I told you.

707
00:30:43,874 --> 00:30:45,623
This isn't going to work.

708
00:30:45,653 --> 00:30:47,597
We'll just invest it somewhere else.

709
00:30:47,627 --> 00:30:49,502
All right, fine, we'll call him.

710
00:30:49,947 --> 00:30:52,097
Wait, invest what somewhere else?

711
00:30:52,697 --> 00:30:54,581
Oh. Oh, that's all right.

712
00:30:54,611 --> 00:30:56,704
It's just that we need a
more certain investment.

713
00:30:56,706 --> 00:30:58,372
I have more certain investments.

714
00:30:58,374 --> 00:31:00,507
Veronica, I told you, this
was one of the riskiest,

715
00:31:00,509 --> 00:31:01,942
with the highest yield.

716
00:31:01,944 --> 00:31:04,044
Yeah, but since she
lost half her savings,

717
00:31:04,046 --> 00:31:05,846
she needs a higher yield.

718
00:31:05,848 --> 00:31:07,813
Wait, so how much do you have to invest?

719
00:31:07,843 --> 00:31:09,864
My husband's pension.

720
00:31:09,894 --> 00:31:11,562
$90,000.

721
00:31:11,592 --> 00:31:15,262
But we need a certain investment.

722
00:31:15,292 --> 00:31:17,387
I have some options.

723
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:18,417
Listen...

724
00:31:19,362 --> 00:31:20,327
How'd it go?

725
00:31:20,329 --> 00:31:21,962
I think I was pretty damn convincing.

726
00:31:21,964 --> 00:31:23,831
"My husband's pension.

727
00:31:23,833 --> 00:31:25,571
I've got to invest it."

728
00:31:25,601 --> 00:31:26,716
He bit?

729
00:31:26,746 --> 00:31:28,766
Hard.

730
00:31:28,796 --> 00:31:30,104
Oh.

731
00:31:30,855 --> 00:31:31,919
Hello?

732
00:31:31,949 --> 00:31:32,840
Hey, Alicia.

733
00:31:32,842 --> 00:31:34,069
Oh, tell her what we did.

734
00:31:34,099 --> 00:31:35,743
Actually, we have another issue.

735
00:31:35,745 --> 00:31:37,511
We think this grand jury investigation

736
00:31:37,513 --> 00:31:39,613
might have something to do with V-Lock.

737
00:31:39,615 --> 00:31:41,148
V-what? What is that?

738
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:43,556
V-Lock. We don't know what it is.

739
00:31:43,586 --> 00:31:44,518
How was it used?

740
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,751
I don't know. Just the issue is V-Lock.

741
00:31:46,781 --> 00:31:52,993
What about State of Illinois v. Lock.

742
00:31:52,995 --> 00:31:54,228
That sounds interesting.

743
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:58,310
We need to look into if
there is a People v. Lock.

744
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:00,234
All right, I'm on it.

745
00:32:00,236 --> 00:32:01,999
Aren't you going to
tell her what we did?

746
00:32:02,029 --> 00:32:03,164
We kicked ass, Alicia.

747
00:32:04,306 --> 00:32:05,539
I'm so glad.

748
00:32:05,764 --> 00:32:07,014
I-I have to go.

749
00:32:07,943 --> 00:32:09,910
Do you have a minute, Alicia?

750
00:32:09,912 --> 00:32:10,912
Sure.

751
00:32:19,175 --> 00:32:22,255
Uh, it's been a bit
of a ride, hasn't it?

752
00:32:25,423 --> 00:32:28,123
I know we've had some
tense moments, but...

753
00:32:29,275 --> 00:32:31,198
I'm very glad you're back home.

754
00:32:31,375 --> 00:32:33,200
- I am, too.
- Good.

755
00:32:33,604 --> 00:32:35,754
Things are finally settling down.

756
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:40,607
Cary thinks you want
to take over the firm

757
00:32:40,609 --> 00:32:42,159
with female partners.

758
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:44,829
Is that true?

759
00:32:46,933 --> 00:32:48,115
No.

760
00:32:49,093 --> 00:32:51,225
A year ago you asked me,

761
00:32:51,255 --> 00:32:53,655
"Why not make it
an all-female firm?"

762
00:32:53,954 --> 00:32:54,954
I know.

763
00:32:56,561 --> 00:32:58,725
But you've changed your mind?

764
00:32:58,727 --> 00:33:00,461
I have become, uh,

765
00:33:00,844 --> 00:33:02,094
more temperate.

766
00:33:04,472 --> 00:33:06,422
But what is it that you want?

767
00:33:06,992 --> 00:33:08,185
I want to be of use.

768
00:33:08,215 --> 00:33:09,815
No, you don't, Alicia.

769
00:33:10,825 --> 00:33:12,258
I've watched you over the years.

770
00:33:12,288 --> 00:33:14,688
You hide your ambition under a bushel,

771
00:33:15,531 --> 00:33:17,481
but it is a very bright lamp.

772
00:33:20,185 --> 00:33:22,656
I was very happy on my own.

773
00:33:23,651 --> 00:33:25,725
I'm very happy here.

774
00:33:25,755 --> 00:33:27,512
You may be suspicious of me,

775
00:33:27,542 --> 00:33:29,637
but all I want is to be of use.

776
00:33:29,667 --> 00:33:31,467
I'm not suspicious of you.

777
00:33:32,303 --> 00:33:34,353
I want to join forces with you.

778
00:33:36,013 --> 00:33:38,063
Uh, could you give us a minute?

779
00:33:39,669 --> 00:33:42,236
I've been working with Cary
now as a fellow name-partner

780
00:33:42,238 --> 00:33:44,358
for a year.

781
00:33:44,388 --> 00:33:48,008
He's learned a lot, I
respect him a great deal,

782
00:33:48,572 --> 00:33:50,372
but he is no Will Gardner.

783
00:33:53,192 --> 00:33:54,468
He doesn't pretend to be.

784
00:33:54,498 --> 00:33:57,098
You don't either, but
you fill his shoes.

785
00:33:59,496 --> 00:34:01,176
You can slice an opponent to shreds,

786
00:34:01,206 --> 00:34:02,189
smiling the whole time,

787
00:34:02,191 --> 00:34:04,629
and they come back, thanking you.

788
00:34:04,659 --> 00:34:08,297
I want someone I can
work across from who...

789
00:34:08,897 --> 00:34:11,747
who I can respect, who
I think can outrace me.

790
00:34:14,022 --> 00:34:15,722
Cary is not that person.

791
00:34:16,519 --> 00:34:20,234
And anyone who's not that
person is holding us back.

792
00:34:23,657 --> 00:34:25,268
So you're a woman,

793
00:34:25,298 --> 00:34:26,398
I'm a woman.

794
00:34:28,213 --> 00:34:29,590
What are you proposing?

795
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:32,570
I'm proposing that we
work together, that's all.

796
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:35,462
To push Cary out?

797
00:34:35,492 --> 00:34:37,990
To buy him out... eventually.

798
00:34:39,753 --> 00:34:41,570
This is not about a take over.

799
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:44,831
This is a way to sharpen our advantage.

800
00:34:45,232 --> 00:34:48,101
There will be a winnowing
among law firms in Chicago.

801
00:34:48,103 --> 00:34:50,210
It's happening already.

802
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:53,040
We need to make ourselves
even more relevant.

803
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:55,390
You and I can do that.

804
00:34:57,377 --> 00:34:58,677
What do you say?

805
00:35:00,903 --> 00:35:02,053
Shall we eat?

806
00:35:12,424 --> 00:35:13,624
I need a word.

807
00:35:15,265 --> 00:35:16,265
Yes.

808
00:35:27,671 --> 00:35:29,271
Who was Richard Locke?

809
00:35:30,636 --> 00:35:31,665
The People v. Locke.

810
00:35:31,695 --> 00:35:32,779
You were the prosecutor.

811
00:35:32,781 --> 00:35:34,915
I was on the team, but I rode the bench.

812
00:35:34,917 --> 00:35:36,650
Matan was lead. Why?

813
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,108
Was it a murder trial?

814
00:35:38,138 --> 00:35:39,720
Yeah. The kid, Richard Locke,

815
00:35:39,722 --> 00:35:41,694
was accused of murdering
his girlfriend's ex.

816
00:35:41,724 --> 00:35:42,988
He claimed it was an accident.

817
00:35:43,018 --> 00:35:44,124
Was it?

818
00:35:44,126 --> 00:35:46,826
Unclear. The case ended
in a mistrial. Why?

819
00:35:47,112 --> 00:35:49,762
Was there anything
unusual about the case?

820
00:35:51,501 --> 00:35:55,073
Well, the defendant, Locke,
was young, working class,

821
00:35:55,103 --> 00:35:56,903
but he had an amazing defense team.

822
00:35:56,905 --> 00:35:57,923
Who paid for that?

823
00:35:57,953 --> 00:36:00,508
We didn't do a source of funds,

824
00:36:00,538 --> 00:36:01,816
but there was a rumor that his father

825
00:36:01,846 --> 00:36:03,596
was someone who mattered.

826
00:36:06,328 --> 00:36:08,548
Are you going to tell
me what this is about?

827
00:36:08,841 --> 00:36:11,251
Is there any chance his father was...?

828
00:36:11,808 --> 00:36:13,708
No, we have to stop talking.

829
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:16,056
You'll be subpoenaed
about what I just asked,

830
00:36:16,058 --> 00:36:17,415
and I will be about what you said,

831
00:36:17,445 --> 00:36:19,885
so I am ending this.

832
00:36:38,429 --> 00:36:40,829
Oh, hey, I'm heading out. What's up?

833
00:36:40,831 --> 00:36:42,225
Sorry, I gotta rush off.

834
00:36:42,255 --> 00:36:43,605
I'd love to talk.

835
00:36:43,849 --> 00:36:46,302
How about later tonight?

836
00:36:46,332 --> 00:36:48,472
Now. Now's good.

837
00:36:48,807 --> 00:36:50,572
Why, what do you need?

838
00:36:50,574 --> 00:36:51,709
So how would this deal work?

839
00:36:51,739 --> 00:36:54,621
If Mom pays you the $90,000,
how is it more secure?

840
00:36:54,651 --> 00:36:56,233
Because it's government guaranteed.

841
00:36:56,263 --> 00:36:58,030
That's like Uncle Sam
insuring your cash.

842
00:36:58,032 --> 00:37:00,432
And we can still get a 14% yield?

843
00:37:00,462 --> 00:37:02,701
That's the beauty of it.

844
00:37:02,703 --> 00:37:04,369
Really?

845
00:37:05,145 --> 00:37:06,416
The beauty of it.

846
00:37:06,446 --> 00:37:08,974
That's illegal... Illinois
is a two party state.

847
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:11,059
You can't use that in a court of law.

848
00:37:11,089 --> 00:37:14,813
I don't plan on using
it in a court of law.

849
00:37:17,302 --> 00:37:19,452
Then how do you plan on using it?

850
00:37:19,924 --> 00:37:22,574
That depends on where
Veronica's money is.

851
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:30,362
I don't understand.

852
00:37:30,364 --> 00:37:31,730
Is it always like this here?

853
00:37:32,072 --> 00:37:33,166
Pretty much.

854
00:37:33,196 --> 00:37:35,072
Diane thinks the firm
needs to be defined.

855
00:37:35,102 --> 00:37:37,107
It needs an identity.

856
00:37:37,137 --> 00:37:38,503
She's not wrong.

857
00:37:38,505 --> 00:37:40,806
All-service firms tend to do too much.

858
00:37:40,808 --> 00:37:42,207
No one knows what they're about.

859
00:37:42,209 --> 00:37:44,176
So an all-women firm.

860
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:45,644
Does anybody want an all-women firm?

861
00:37:45,674 --> 00:37:48,503
An all-women partner firm.

862
00:37:48,533 --> 00:37:49,783
Some people do.

863
00:37:50,271 --> 00:37:52,317
Some people think they know
what they're buying into

864
00:37:52,319 --> 00:37:53,966
with a female lawyer.

865
00:37:53,996 --> 00:37:56,329
Softer. More hand-holding.

866
00:37:56,359 --> 00:37:57,745
I know, but what do you think?

867
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:59,074
Do we get paid more money?

868
00:37:59,076 --> 00:38:00,934
- I would.
- Oh, great.

869
00:38:00,964 --> 00:38:02,664
You probably would, too.

870
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:06,379
I like Cary.

871
00:38:06,874 --> 00:38:08,951
I like Cary, too.

872
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:11,004
- But...
- But what?

873
00:38:11,034 --> 00:38:12,957
No, it just seems like you
were going to add a "but."

874
00:38:12,987 --> 00:38:15,527
No, it's just, before I left here,

875
00:38:15,557 --> 00:38:17,192
Jason wanted me to be name partner.

876
00:38:17,194 --> 00:38:18,194
Jason?

877
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:20,979
I mean, Will.

878
00:38:20,981 --> 00:38:22,280
That was weird.

879
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:23,470
Will.

880
00:38:26,412 --> 00:38:28,787
So, Jason, huh?

881
00:38:29,016 --> 00:38:30,816
- What?
- Jason.

882
00:38:30,846 --> 00:38:32,624
You having a good time together?

883
00:38:32,626 --> 00:38:35,293
We're just... nothing.

884
00:38:35,295 --> 00:38:36,927
So what do you think I should do?

885
00:38:36,957 --> 00:38:38,407
Do I go with Diane?

886
00:38:38,989 --> 00:38:41,677
Or... do I tell Cary and David Lee

887
00:38:41,707 --> 00:38:43,212
that she approached me?

888
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,655
Tell Cary.

889
00:38:49,067 --> 00:38:50,035
Really?

890
00:38:50,065 --> 00:38:51,065
Really.

891
00:38:54,209 --> 00:38:55,209
Okay.

892
00:38:56,197 --> 00:38:57,796
I'm turning my brain off.

893
00:38:58,104 --> 00:38:59,145
I'm going home.

894
00:38:59,175 --> 00:39:00,825
You want to get a drink?

895
00:39:00,855 --> 00:39:02,840
No, I'm too tired.

896
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:04,403
Next time.

897
00:39:16,067 --> 00:39:17,582
Long day.

898
00:39:18,027 --> 00:39:20,519
Mmm... let's make it longer.

899
00:39:26,285 --> 00:39:28,760
Thank you for helping out today.

900
00:39:28,762 --> 00:39:31,163
Mmm, no problem.

901
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:37,158
Damn it.

902
00:39:37,188 --> 00:39:38,735
Just ignore it.

903
00:39:39,053 --> 00:39:40,723
Alicia, it's your mom!

904
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:43,442
Oh, come on.

905
00:39:43,472 --> 00:39:45,344
It's not for you. It's for Jason.

906
00:39:45,346 --> 00:39:47,346
I want to thank him.

907
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,320
Yeah.

908
00:39:52,102 --> 00:39:53,302
That's my mom.

909
00:39:54,655 --> 00:39:56,655
- Get inside!
- Don't let him in!

910
00:39:57,691 --> 00:40:00,625
Alicia?

Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
