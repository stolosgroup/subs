1
00:00:00,869 --> 00:00:02,495
Previously on "The Good Wife"...

2
00:00:02,823 --> 00:00:05,015
I found a receipt, but
it's not under Florrick.

3
00:00:05,031 --> 00:00:06,295
Could the name be Kozko?

4
00:00:07,263 --> 00:00:08,959
If you accidentally cross the line,

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,075
then you see the telephone
caller from our monitoring center.

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,284
You need to answer that
phone within 5 rings

7
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:16,187
or you're terminated from the
program. Do you understand?

8
00:00:16,207 --> 00:00:17,177
I understand.

9
00:00:19,869 --> 00:00:22,434
- It's over.
- What's over?

10
00:00:22,641 --> 00:00:24,167
Us. Me caring.

11
00:00:24,308 --> 00:00:26,370
Me actually thinking that you're changing.

12
00:00:27,217 --> 00:00:28,363
I am changing.

13
00:00:28,386 --> 00:00:29,810
No you're not. 

14
00:00:29,847 --> 00:00:30,525
They're fighting.

15
00:00:30,555 --> 00:00:33,304
You want to think you are so you
can go back to what you did before.

16
00:00:33,632 --> 00:00:34,585
Then help me.

17
00:00:35,344 --> 00:00:36,377
Mom's leaving.

18
00:00:37,474 --> 00:00:38,339
I don't know.

19
00:00:38,557 --> 00:00:39,661
Help me.

20
00:00:40,156 --> 00:00:41,885
If you're right, help me.

21
00:00:42,357 --> 00:00:43,858
They're going to divorce.

22
00:00:43,859 --> 00:00:45,960
- No.
- We don't know that.

23
00:00:47,829 --> 00:00:49,397
Mom just left.

24
00:00:49,398 --> 00:00:51,208
She just walked out the door.

25
00:00:52,467 --> 00:00:53,734
We're going to be okay.

26
00:00:54,625 --> 00:00:57,605
I was liking having dad back, too.

27
00:00:57,606 --> 00:00:59,864
Just like before.

28
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

29
00:01:08,049 --> 00:01:09,172
Dad?

30
00:01:32,374 --> 00:01:34,542
- Hi.
- Hey. I just moved the 

31
00:01:34,543 --> 00:01:38,079
reservation at the
National Cafe in 40 minutes.

32
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,380
If that's alright.

33
00:01:39,381 --> 00:01:41,382
You sure?

34
00:01:41,383 --> 00:01:44,018
Yeah, I'm trying to be
spontaneous these days.

35
00:01:44,019 --> 00:01:45,953
Okay. I'll see you then.

36
00:01:46,867 --> 00:01:48,089
Okay?

37
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:49,651
Okay.

38
00:02:03,226 --> 00:02:04,805
Peter, no!

39
00:02:04,806 --> 00:02:05,899
You...

40
00:02:06,808 --> 00:02:08,342
I love you.

41
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,911
You can't be down here!

42
00:02:10,912 --> 00:02:11,684
Please.

43
00:02:12,357 --> 00:02:13,821
Don't leave me.

44
00:02:15,941 --> 00:02:17,518
You have to be upstairs, Peter.

45
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:18,686
I can't lose you.

46
00:02:18,687 --> 00:02:19,787
I can't lose Zach. I can't lose Grace.

47
00:02:19,788 --> 00:02:21,489
Daniel, Daniel Golden.

48
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:23,124
Tell him it's an emergency!

49
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:24,625
Peter's going to be
arrested in 20 minutes.

50
00:02:24,626 --> 00:02:25,793
Dad?

51
00:02:29,496 --> 00:02:30,746
Dad?

52
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:34,935
Hey, Zach? Grace?

53
00:02:34,936 --> 00:02:36,704
Is everything alright?

54
00:02:36,705 --> 00:02:38,406
My mom's getting
complaints from the tenants.

55
00:02:40,842 --> 00:02:42,743
It's the police. No, Zach, don't!

56
00:02:42,744 --> 00:02:44,745
We have five rings or
dad's going to prison.

57
00:02:44,746 --> 00:02:46,447
Dad has to answer.

58
00:02:46,448 --> 00:02:48,349
We'll say we're getting him.

59
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:50,518
That's four rings.

60
00:02:53,488 --> 00:02:55,022
Hello?

61
00:02:55,023 --> 00:02:56,891
This is Sergeant Thacker at HMD center.

62
00:02:56,892 --> 00:02:58,259
Please identify yourself.

63
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,427
This is Grace.

64
00:02:59,428 --> 00:03:00,828
Grace Florrick.

65
00:03:00,829 --> 00:03:04,031
We've received an alert there's been
an unauthorized breach of the perimeter.

66
00:03:04,032 --> 00:03:06,133
Please put Mr. Florrick on the line.

67
00:03:06,134 --> 00:03:08,035
That's my dad. Um...

68
00:03:08,036 --> 00:03:09,136
Please put your father on the line.

69
00:03:09,137 --> 00:03:10,171
I need to speak to him now.

70
00:03:10,172 --> 00:03:11,839
Okay, hold one minute.

71
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,336
I'm going to go get him.

72
00:03:13,842 --> 00:03:15,843
Say he's in the shower.
I'll go downstairs.

73
00:03:15,844 --> 00:03:16,811
No.

74
00:03:28,123 --> 00:03:31,325
Dad, there's someone here for you.

75
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,465
He's in the shower.

76
00:03:37,466 --> 00:03:39,934
Um... He'll be out in a minute.

77
00:03:39,935 --> 00:03:41,669
- He's not there, is he?
- No, he's here.

78
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:43,270
He's... He's just in the shower.

79
00:03:43,271 --> 00:03:44,572
He's rushing.

80
00:03:44,573 --> 00:03:46,874
This is my last request for you
to put Mr. Florrick on the phone.

81
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:50,378
Dad, they need you right now.

82
00:03:54,477 --> 00:03:55,916
They're going to take dad.

83
00:04:12,501 --> 00:04:13,667
Watch out.

84
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,796
What do we do, Peter?

85
00:04:35,624 --> 00:04:37,980
You're going back to jail.

86
00:04:41,844 --> 00:04:43,297
I know.

87
00:04:45,233 --> 00:04:46,267
Hello?

88
00:04:49,738 --> 00:04:51,806
Zach!

89
00:04:51,807 --> 00:04:53,073
Zach!

90
00:04:53,742 --> 00:04:55,576
What happened?

91
00:04:55,577 --> 00:04:57,111
It's my arm. Where?

92
00:04:57,112 --> 00:04:58,712
- I was skateboarding.
- No, he's here.

93
00:04:58,713 --> 00:05:00,080
My dad's right here.

94
00:05:00,081 --> 00:05:01,482
No, it was a skateboard.

95
00:05:01,483 --> 00:05:02,817
It's okay. I got you.

96
00:05:02,818 --> 00:05:04,819
No, he never left.

97
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,720
My dad's with my brother.

98
00:05:06,721 --> 00:05:07,988
He's bleeding.

99
00:05:07,989 --> 00:05:09,623
Grace, what are you doing?

100
00:05:11,493 --> 00:05:13,594
Keeping dad.

101
00:05:37,776 --> 00:05:39,069
Now I'm going to talk to you.

102
00:05:39,073 --> 00:05:40,512
It's Amal, right?

103
00:05:40,531 --> 00:05:42,204
- Amal.
- Yeah.

104
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:44,209
Now, when you first
arrived at the apartment,

105
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:46,709
did you, uh, see Mr. Florrick?

106
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:49,814
Yes.

107
00:05:49,815 --> 00:05:50,882
You're sure.

108
00:05:50,883 --> 00:05:53,151
Yeah, he just, uh, got out of the shower.

109
00:05:55,087 --> 00:05:57,522
Now, your mother is the building manager?

110
00:05:57,523 --> 00:06:00,725
Yes, uh, on the fourth
floor. I came up because, um,

111
00:06:01,483 --> 00:06:03,261
we got some complaints about the noise.

112
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:04,662
Do you have some I.D.?

113
00:06:05,217 --> 00:06:06,831
Yeah, I probably have something.

114
00:06:06,832 --> 00:06:08,032
What do you need?

115
00:06:08,033 --> 00:06:09,801
A current driver's license...

116
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:11,503
What were you thinking?

117
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:13,071
They were going to arrest dad.

118
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:17,464
Um... Hello.

119
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:20,311
These are beautiful bookcases.

120
00:06:20,312 --> 00:06:21,446
Are you with the police?

121
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:22,447
Mrs. Florrick, your daughter

122
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:24,482
said the HMD sent a false positive,

123
00:06:24,483 --> 00:06:28,419
because your son was...
attempting a crooked grind

124
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,421
and slammed into it.

125
00:06:30,422 --> 00:06:32,123
Sheriff, she's just a kid.

126
00:06:32,124 --> 00:06:33,591
Meaning what?

127
00:06:33,592 --> 00:06:35,627
- She's lying?
- Uh, sheriff,

128
00:06:35,628 --> 00:06:36,761
if I could interrupt.

129
00:06:36,762 --> 00:06:38,796
Good evening, first of all.

130
00:06:38,797 --> 00:06:40,665
I'm going to ask Mr. and Mrs. Florrick

131
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,901
not to answer any more of your questions.

132
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:45,803
Uh, Mrs. Florrick, I'm
Daniel Golden's partner.

133
00:06:45,804 --> 00:06:48,806
And I ask that all questions
be directed through me.

134
00:06:48,807 --> 00:06:51,175
Well, I could take Mr.
Florrick in right now.

135
00:06:51,176 --> 00:06:53,645
Yes, and where was Mr.
Florrick when you arrived?

136
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:57,081
Um... He failed to answer his HMD call.

137
00:06:57,082 --> 00:07:00,718
Due to the fact that his son was
injured in a skateboarding accident.

138
00:07:00,719 --> 00:07:02,720
Again, where did you find Mr. Florrick?

139
00:07:02,721 --> 00:07:04,088
Excuse me, we received a warning

140
00:07:04,089 --> 00:07:05,823
that the perimeter had been breached.

141
00:07:05,824 --> 00:07:07,258
Due to a malfunctioning unit.

142
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:09,694
You found Mr. Florrick in his apartment.

143
00:07:09,695 --> 00:07:10,828
'Cause he returned.

144
00:07:10,829 --> 00:07:12,997
Or never left.

145
00:07:12,998 --> 00:07:16,101
Hey, who installed the HMD unit?

146
00:07:16,329 --> 00:07:17,201
Who installed it?

147
00:07:17,202 --> 00:07:18,937
- I did.
- Why?

148
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:21,205
Do you know what an ohs clip is?

149
00:07:21,206 --> 00:07:24,642
An itty-bitty wire clip about this big.

150
00:07:24,643 --> 00:07:26,285
It's required by the sheriff's department

151
00:07:26,304 --> 00:07:28,479
whenever an HMD is installed.

152
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,182
One clip for every one foot of wire.

153
00:07:31,183 --> 00:07:33,284
Do you know how much wire you installed?

154
00:07:33,285 --> 00:07:35,420
Who are you?

155
00:07:35,857 --> 00:07:37,889
Elsbeth Tascioni.

156
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:39,090
Hi.

157
00:07:39,091 --> 00:07:41,759
You installed, by my
eye, three feet of wire.

158
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,162
And do you know how many
ohs clips you installed?

159
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:45,563
None.

160
00:07:45,564 --> 00:07:48,199
People don't like permanent
fixtures in their houses.

161
00:07:49,113 --> 00:07:52,604
Well, that's very kind of you, sheriff.

162
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:54,005
But it's still an infraction.

163
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:55,239
And unfortunately in this case,

164
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,942
your loose wire is what tripped up

165
00:07:57,943 --> 00:08:00,912
young Mr. Florrick's
skateboard causing his injury.

166
00:08:09,713 --> 00:08:11,089
- Thank you.
- You know,

167
00:08:11,682 --> 00:08:14,058
I wish I had an eye with color.

168
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,662
I'm always mixing oranges with reds.

169
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,030
Is that you?

170
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:20,291
Is that...

171
00:08:25,924 --> 00:08:27,071
Will.

172
00:08:27,072 --> 00:08:28,840
Hey. Is everything alright?

173
00:08:29,811 --> 00:08:30,808
I'm so sorry.

174
00:08:30,809 --> 00:08:32,777
It's been such chaos around here.

175
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:34,946
It's okay.

176
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:36,414
We'll talk tomorrow.

177
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:02,607
Hey, Sadie.

178
00:09:02,608 --> 00:09:05,306
Sorry for flaking out on you tonight.

179
00:09:05,644 --> 00:09:08,646
No, my emergency fell through.

180
00:09:08,647 --> 00:09:10,001
Do you want to...

181
00:09:10,649 --> 00:09:12,550
What favor?

182
00:09:53,529 --> 00:09:54,992
What's wrong?

183
00:09:56,795 --> 00:09:58,996
We're not going toward your floor.

184
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:37,702
What we have here is a rather large

185
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:40,404
collection of items
with your name on them.

186
00:10:40,405 --> 00:10:42,473
You don't need to be nervous.

187
00:10:42,474 --> 00:10:44,475
I'm your friend here.

188
00:10:44,476 --> 00:10:45,977
They aren't mine.

189
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,178
Really.

190
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:50,515
Look, the sheriff ran
your I.D. last night, Amal.

191
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:53,985
It triggered a red flag warning to me.

192
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:57,288
You see, there are a dozen credit cards,

193
00:10:57,289 --> 00:11:00,258
driver's licenses, passports
with your name on 'em.

194
00:11:00,974 --> 00:11:02,393
You know how that could've happened?

195
00:11:03,173 --> 00:11:05,429
No. I don't.

196
00:11:06,276 --> 00:11:09,066
Were you paid to let
someone use your identity?

197
00:11:09,067 --> 00:11:10,535
- Simran?
- Are you certain?

198
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:11,869
Oh.

199
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:13,104
Is everything okay?

200
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:15,673
Yes, Alicia. Um, they just...

201
00:11:15,674 --> 00:11:18,843
they have a few questions, um, for Amal.

202
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:20,578
It's about work.

203
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:23,047
Do you... Do you want me to do anything?

204
00:11:23,048 --> 00:11:24,315
Oh. No.

205
00:11:24,316 --> 00:11:25,483
I don't know.

206
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:28,786
They said it would only
take a minute, and so...

207
00:11:28,787 --> 00:11:30,922
Amal isn't in trouble.

208
00:11:33,358 --> 00:11:35,760
You don't want to get in trouble, Amal.

209
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:38,095
- No.
- Then why aren't you answering honestly?

210
00:11:38,096 --> 00:11:39,564
I am answering honestly.

211
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:41,432
I don't know anything about this.

212
00:11:41,433 --> 00:11:42,600
I swear.

213
00:11:42,601 --> 00:11:44,268
Excuse me, gentlemen.

214
00:11:48,028 --> 00:11:49,841
Is Amal a suspect here?

215
00:11:49,842 --> 00:11:52,743
Because if so, you probably
should read him his rights.

216
00:11:52,744 --> 00:11:54,612
Not a suspect... At this time.

217
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:56,514
We're asking a few questions. That's all.

218
00:11:57,197 --> 00:11:58,716
Mrs. Florrick, isn't it?

219
00:11:58,717 --> 00:12:00,418
Y... Yes.

220
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:02,053
You just accused him of being dishonest,

221
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:04,055
and warned him he could get into trouble.

222
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,990
We're trying to ascertain his connection

223
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:07,325
to an identity theft ring.

224
00:12:10,173 --> 00:12:10,828
Simran,

225
00:12:10,829 --> 00:12:13,064
I think you should invite
these gentlemen to leave.

226
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:16,167
We only need a few more
minutes, Mrs. Verma.

227
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:17,668
If you don't want them here,
you can ask them to leave,

228
00:12:17,669 --> 00:12:18,864
Simran.

229
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:24,675
Gentlemen...

230
00:12:24,676 --> 00:12:26,844
Would you please leave?

231
00:12:33,763 --> 00:12:35,820
My guess is they're just fishing.

232
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:40,224
Look, I... I didn't do anything wrong, mom.

233
00:12:40,225 --> 00:12:42,693
I swear.

234
00:12:42,694 --> 00:12:44,528
I have to rush to work,

235
00:12:44,529 --> 00:12:47,665
but if you need anything,
just call me, okay?

236
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:49,800
Thank you, Alicia.

237
00:12:49,801 --> 00:12:51,469
Of course.

238
00:12:53,363 --> 00:12:54,472
Does he have a moment?

239
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:56,007
Actually, Will's out today.

240
00:12:56,008 --> 00:12:57,108
He's... Oh, court?

241
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:58,376
No, volunteer work.

242
00:12:58,377 --> 00:12:59,477
All very last minute.

243
00:12:59,478 --> 00:13:00,645
He's out until Thursday.

244
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:02,013
Thursday?

245
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:04,415
So this is the favor?

246
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:06,017
For an old college chum.

247
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:07,184
Very hot.

248
00:13:07,185 --> 00:13:08,286
That's right.

249
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,921
You have a thing for judges.

250
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:11,122
My first husband.

251
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:12,590
It's not half bad.

252
00:13:12,591 --> 00:13:14,759
I wonder if I can get it fitted.

253
00:13:17,195 --> 00:13:18,496
Objection, Your Honor.

254
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:19,730
Uh, calls for speculation.

255
00:13:19,731 --> 00:13:22,466
The question asks Mr.
Hunter to guess the answer

256
00:13:22,467 --> 00:13:24,144
rather than rely on facts.

257
00:13:24,162 --> 00:13:25,836
Yes, that is the
definition of speculation.

258
00:13:25,837 --> 00:13:27,104
Congratulations, Mr. Bigelow.

259
00:13:27,105 --> 00:13:28,873
Too bad I didn't do that.

260
00:13:28,874 --> 00:13:29,941
Sustained.

261
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:31,342
Exception.

262
00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:34,345
Noted, and when you go to
mock trial appeal court,

263
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:36,614
Ms. Cabrini, you can argue it there.

264
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:40,217
Now, Mr. Hunter,

265
00:13:40,218 --> 00:13:42,486
I just want to understand
the sequence of events.

266
00:13:42,487 --> 00:13:44,588
You say that you saw my
clients entering the cottage?

267
00:13:44,589 --> 00:13:47,224
Yes. I was hunting in the
forest when I heard a scream.

268
00:13:47,225 --> 00:13:49,026
Actually, you said "screams"?

269
00:13:49,027 --> 00:13:50,761
Yes. Screams.

270
00:13:50,762 --> 00:13:54,165
And you said that you recognize
those as belonging to the witch?

271
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,800
That's right. She lives
in that gingerbread house.

272
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:57,568
Oh. So you just assumed

273
00:13:57,569 --> 00:14:00,838
that it was the witch's scream
coming from inside the oven?

274
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:02,907
No. I recognized her voice.

275
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:07,812
Oh. So you have the power to
distinguish between screams?

276
00:14:07,813 --> 00:14:09,146
Well, how about this one?

277
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:11,182
Objection! Your Honor!

278
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:12,783
Ms. Cabrini!

279
00:14:12,784 --> 00:14:14,485
- Sustained.
- Sustained, what?

280
00:14:14,486 --> 00:14:15,812
What's the objection?

281
00:14:17,789 --> 00:14:19,323
Badgering the witness.

282
00:14:19,324 --> 00:14:21,492
You're arguing the
prosecution's case, Your Honor.

283
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:23,094
Excuse me, Ms. Cabrini.

284
00:14:23,095 --> 00:14:25,096
I am not doing anything of the sort.

285
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:26,931
Okay, let's leave it there.
We'll pick it up tomorrow.

286
00:14:27,435 --> 00:14:30,101
Now, remember, even though
this is a mock trial,

287
00:14:30,102 --> 00:14:32,403
I do not want the jury
discussing the case.

288
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:33,537
This is not a joke.

289
00:14:33,538 --> 00:14:35,373
Grades depend on its outcome.

290
00:14:35,985 --> 00:14:40,077
And let's thank our judge, Mr. Will
Gardner, for volunteering his time.

291
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:47,318
Anyone else have a problem with
the argument on page 18, mid-page?

292
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:48,586
You mean mine?

293
00:14:48,587 --> 00:14:51,255
Well, I didn't know it was yours.

294
00:14:51,256 --> 00:14:54,392
I just find the citing's a bit off topic.

295
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:57,561
Our clients are suing because
their video game was stolen.

296
00:14:57,562 --> 00:14:58,863
That's all.

297
00:14:58,864 --> 00:15:00,331
Well, I'm here to listen, Cary,

298
00:15:00,332 --> 00:15:01,699
so why don't you tell me

299
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,868
how my citings could be more on topic?

300
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:07,271
Well... One minute.

301
00:15:15,025 --> 00:15:15,690
What's up?

302
00:15:15,732 --> 00:15:17,515
Nothing. Neighborhood kids need help.

303
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:19,283
Want me to get rid of them?

304
00:15:19,284 --> 00:15:20,618
No, thank you.

305
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:22,787
Billable hours, Alicia.

306
00:15:22,788 --> 00:15:24,588
Cary's got his eye on the prize.

307
00:15:24,589 --> 00:15:26,824
- Billable hours.
- Thanks, Kalinda.

308
00:15:26,825 --> 00:15:29,427
Sorry, but we didn't
know who else to contact.

309
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:30,661
That's okay. What happened?

310
00:15:30,662 --> 00:15:32,797
They came for her an hour after you left.

311
00:15:32,798 --> 00:15:34,298
They can't just take her away.

312
00:15:34,299 --> 00:15:35,433
Can they?

313
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:36,767
This was about me.

314
00:15:36,768 --> 00:15:38,035
They want me.

315
00:15:38,036 --> 00:15:39,003
Wait. Who came?

316
00:15:39,004 --> 00:15:41,105
Mom was going to the grocery store

317
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:43,007
when this van...

318
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:45,810
These men got out and took her.

319
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:48,345
All we got was this phone number to call.

320
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:51,615
The line's been busy all day.

321
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:57,388
I thought your...

322
00:15:57,389 --> 00:15:58,856
Your mom's a citizen, right?

323
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:04,595
She spent $8,000 on an immigration
attorney who ripped her off

324
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:08,132
and never filed for a green
card, so she just gave up.

325
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:11,769
She's lived here for 27 years.

326
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:14,705
Look, I have some names
of immigration attorneys.

327
00:16:14,706 --> 00:16:16,540
I'll get them for you.

328
00:16:18,768 --> 00:16:20,411
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

329
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:24,315
This way.

330
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:26,450
You're such a pushover.

331
00:16:26,451 --> 00:16:27,785
I am not.

332
00:16:27,786 --> 00:16:29,553
I'm responsible.

333
00:16:29,554 --> 00:16:32,089
No, I mean, I'm responsible
for the feds questioning him.

334
00:16:32,671 --> 00:16:35,392
You're not responsible for
everything bad in the world, Alicia.

335
00:16:36,983 --> 00:16:38,762
Where would they put her, the mom?

336
00:16:38,763 --> 00:16:40,831
Broadview, McHenry Detention,

337
00:16:40,832 --> 00:16:42,266
general population at cook county.

338
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:43,834
They make it a shell game.

339
00:16:43,835 --> 00:16:45,002
But you could find her?

340
00:16:45,003 --> 00:16:46,103
So you're the pushover,

341
00:16:46,104 --> 00:16:47,972
I'm the one who actually does the work?

342
00:16:47,973 --> 00:16:49,840
No, no. It's fine. I can do it.

343
00:16:49,841 --> 00:16:51,542
Thank you.

344
00:16:58,083 --> 00:16:59,984
Mama?

345
00:17:03,084 --> 00:17:03,632
Thanks.

346
00:17:03,673 --> 00:17:06,390
Hey, my good deed for the year.

347
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:09,426
Thank you, Mrs. Florrick.

348
00:17:09,427 --> 00:17:10,928
Please stand on the lines.

349
00:17:13,798 --> 00:17:15,032
All rise, please.

350
00:17:15,033 --> 00:17:18,402
The Honorable Judge
Gordon Tomlin presiding.

351
00:17:19,604 --> 00:17:24,141
I'm judge Tomlin, presiding immigration
judge via closed-circuit in Miami.

352
00:17:24,142 --> 00:17:27,319
Currently presiding
over cook county I.C.E.

353
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:29,046
Are we ready, miss...?

354
00:17:29,047 --> 00:17:30,514
Bow. Yes, Your Honor.

355
00:17:30,515 --> 00:17:32,883
I.C.E. is petitioning the court

356
00:17:32,884 --> 00:17:35,085
for summary judgment on
Simran Verma's immediate

357
00:17:35,086 --> 00:17:37,755
removal and deportation
to her native India.

358
00:17:37,756 --> 00:17:39,223
Your Honor, I'm sorry,

359
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:41,759
but Simran has lived
in America for 27 years.

360
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,128
Too loud for the microphone, ma'am.

361
00:17:45,008 --> 00:17:48,699
Mrs. Verma has demonstrated
good moral character.

362
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,335
She supports herself
as a building manager,

363
00:17:51,336 --> 00:17:52,636
and she would be subjected

364
00:17:52,637 --> 00:17:54,705
to undue hardship if she were separated

365
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:56,173
from her American-born children.

366
00:17:56,174 --> 00:18:00,010
She more than qualifies for
an adjusted residence status.

367
00:18:00,011 --> 00:18:02,413
Your Honor, I have a copy
of Simran's application

368
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,648
for a driver's license from the DMV.

369
00:18:04,649 --> 00:18:07,785
On the application, she checked
the voter registration box,

370
00:18:07,786 --> 00:18:11,155
thus making a false claim of
citizenship, a federal offense.

371
00:18:11,156 --> 00:18:14,091
Your Honor, these forms are confusing
and often filled out by rote.

372
00:18:14,092 --> 00:18:18,596
The application clearly States that making
a false claim is a serious federal offense.

373
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,931
Mrs. Verma should be
permanently inadmissible

374
00:18:20,932 --> 00:18:22,900
as a citizen of the United States.

375
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:25,536
Your Honor, her ties to
America are very strong.

376
00:18:25,537 --> 00:18:27,671
Too close for the microphone again, ma'am.

377
00:18:27,672 --> 00:18:30,207
Summary judgment approved.

378
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:32,710
Mrs. Verma's deportation is approved.

379
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:33,877
Next case.

380
00:18:33,878 --> 00:18:35,879
Oh, Your Honor... But, Your...

381
00:18:36,517 --> 00:18:37,183
What?

382
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:38,882
- What is happening?
- Is that it?

383
00:18:38,883 --> 00:18:40,651
- Are they taking her back?
- Mrs. Florrick?

384
00:18:40,652 --> 00:18:41,852
- What happened?
- Wait. Wait. Mom.

385
00:18:41,853 --> 00:18:42,987
- What has happened?
- You can't take her!

386
00:18:42,988 --> 00:18:44,555
Mom! Mom!

387
00:18:44,556 --> 00:18:46,056
This is absurd. I am not a criminal.

388
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:52,396
Mr. Belkin!

389
00:18:52,397 --> 00:18:53,831
So that's what this is about.

390
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:55,499
I won't confirm or deny,

391
00:18:56,428 --> 00:18:57,554
but, ma'am, it would have been better

392
00:18:57,579 --> 00:18:58,669
if you'd let us question him.

393
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,170
What do you want?

394
00:19:00,171 --> 00:19:03,674
Identity theft is a multi-billion
dollar burr in the side of America.

395
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:07,244
All I ask is that Amal
do his patriotic duty,

396
00:19:07,245 --> 00:19:10,014
help us bring down the major player.

397
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:13,517
He does that, you stop
his mother's deportation?

398
00:19:13,518 --> 00:19:15,786
I'll put in a good word.

399
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:20,291
That's the problem with good deeds...

400
00:19:21,075 --> 00:19:22,354
they multiply.

401
00:19:29,657 --> 00:19:32,085
What? I got it cleaned.

402
00:19:32,112 --> 00:19:34,380
So this is why you dropped
all of your appointments

403
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:35,648
for the next two days?

404
00:19:35,649 --> 00:19:37,116
Hey, I'm doing good for the community,

405
00:19:37,117 --> 00:19:39,351
and I'm keeping an eye
on law school prospects.

406
00:19:39,352 --> 00:19:42,321
And of course, there's always your
good friend, Professor Sadie Hart.

407
00:19:42,322 --> 00:19:43,860
You know what?

408
00:19:44,858 --> 00:19:47,359
I'm not a bad judge.

409
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,694
What's the case?

410
00:19:48,695 --> 00:19:49,962
The mock trial?

411
00:19:49,963 --> 00:19:52,555
It's a... A murder.

412
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:54,266
Yeah. Double defendants.

413
00:19:54,267 --> 00:19:56,068
- Brother and sister.
- And the victim?

414
00:19:57,564 --> 00:19:58,504
A homeowner.

415
00:19:59,493 --> 00:20:00,773
It's a fairy tale, isn't it?

416
00:20:01,153 --> 00:20:01,874
Hansel and Gretel.

417
00:20:02,897 --> 00:20:04,343
But it brings up some
interesting legal issues:

418
00:20:04,344 --> 00:20:06,478
Trespass, castle law.

419
00:20:06,479 --> 00:20:08,080
Eating other people's houses?

420
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:10,549
Oh, Will, Alicia dropped by
yesterday wanting a few minutes.

421
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:11,917
Okay. Got it. Thanks.

422
00:20:15,527 --> 00:20:17,590
We are going to have
to deal with that, too.

423
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:19,458
That?

424
00:20:19,459 --> 00:20:21,293
The junior associate position.

425
00:20:21,294 --> 00:20:22,695
Cary and Alicia.

426
00:20:22,696 --> 00:20:25,040
We said six months, it's been seven.

427
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:26,599
It's bad economy to drop somebody.

428
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,733
Are you getting cold feet?

429
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:30,469
Next week.

430
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:32,571
Next week.

431
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:37,076
They think your work is a
front for selling stolen I.D.'s.

432
00:20:37,077 --> 00:20:39,211
The travel agency?

433
00:20:39,212 --> 00:20:41,146
They traced the false
I. D.'s to that address.

434
00:20:41,739 --> 00:20:43,249
Have you seen anything there?

435
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:44,547
No.

436
00:20:45,542 --> 00:20:48,420
But... I haven't wanted to see.

437
00:20:49,307 --> 00:20:51,190
He'll get our mom a visa...

438
00:20:51,191 --> 00:20:52,916
this Belkin... If Amal cooperates?

439
00:20:52,943 --> 00:20:53,459
Yeah.

440
00:20:53,946 --> 00:20:55,661
The feds want you to download three files

441
00:20:55,662 --> 00:20:57,263
from your boss's computer:

442
00:20:57,264 --> 00:20:59,732
Pal-one, two, three.

443
00:20:59,733 --> 00:21:01,166
It's mom.

444
00:21:02,002 --> 00:21:03,669
You have to. Amal.

445
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:04,803
I know.

446
00:21:04,804 --> 00:21:07,906
You don't know what
these guys are capable of.

447
00:21:07,907 --> 00:21:09,908
I don't know why you think
you're the only one...!

448
00:21:09,909 --> 00:21:11,610
You seem less than sympathetic.

449
00:21:12,274 --> 00:21:13,379
Their mother's illegal.

450
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:15,014
With 27 years in this country.

451
00:21:15,015 --> 00:21:16,915
27 years of being illegal.

452
00:21:16,916 --> 00:21:19,151
I would've thought you
would've been more sympathetic.

453
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:20,252
Why?

454
00:21:20,253 --> 00:21:22,454
Because my parents immigrated legally,

455
00:21:22,455 --> 00:21:23,922
you thought I'd be more sympathetic

456
00:21:23,923 --> 00:21:26,158
to someone who immigrated here illegally?

457
00:21:27,018 --> 00:21:27,860
My mistake.

458
00:21:27,861 --> 00:21:29,528
So, who are they?

459
00:21:30,271 --> 00:21:31,764
Big case.

460
00:21:31,765 --> 00:21:33,599
Can't talk about it.

461
00:21:36,325 --> 00:21:37,214
Yeah?

462
00:21:40,305 --> 00:21:42,540
They're the video game clients, right?

463
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:44,408
Can't talk about it.

464
00:21:45,024 --> 00:21:47,011
Well, do you need some help with it?

465
00:21:47,365 --> 00:21:49,365
Because I know the gamer world.

466
00:21:50,797 --> 00:21:52,483
Lucky you.

467
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:57,521
I'm sorry I didn't call
you back right away.

468
00:21:57,522 --> 00:22:00,291
I'm on this mock trial thing at Depaul.

469
00:22:00,292 --> 00:22:01,626
Oh, that's alright.

470
00:22:01,627 --> 00:22:05,630
I was just making sure everything
was alright after the other night.

471
00:22:05,631 --> 00:22:07,164
One minute.

472
00:22:10,702 --> 00:22:12,403
Everything is alright.

473
00:22:12,404 --> 00:22:13,552
You sure?

474
00:22:14,506 --> 00:22:17,541
Because... I'm sorry.

475
00:22:17,542 --> 00:22:21,812
Alicia, you don't have
any reason to be sorry.

476
00:22:22,505 --> 00:22:25,049
I was pushing a situation
that was wrong to push.

477
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:26,150
You weren't.

478
00:22:26,151 --> 00:22:27,785
I was.

479
00:22:27,786 --> 00:22:30,287
Don't worry.

480
00:22:30,288 --> 00:22:31,622
We're good.

481
00:22:31,623 --> 00:22:32,957
We're going to be good.

482
00:22:42,161 --> 00:22:44,802
Pal-one, two, three?

483
00:22:44,803 --> 00:22:45,870
Yes, just three files.

484
00:22:45,871 --> 00:22:47,204
That's all they want.

485
00:22:47,205 --> 00:22:48,572
You won't be alone.

486
00:22:48,573 --> 00:22:49,774
Look.

487
00:22:50,742 --> 00:22:52,610
They don't want to arrest them;

488
00:22:52,611 --> 00:22:54,979
they want to do this quietly, in and out.

489
00:23:00,018 --> 00:23:03,788
Did you tell them about
the Pujari brothers?

490
00:23:03,789 --> 00:23:05,990
Belkin knows that your bosses
are potentially dangerous.

491
00:23:05,991 --> 00:23:07,792
He also knows you did nothing wrong.

492
00:23:07,793 --> 00:23:10,261
He'll keep his promise
to release my mother?

493
00:23:10,262 --> 00:23:12,063
We have a deal in writing.

494
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:14,932
Amal,

495
00:23:14,933 --> 00:23:17,968
take a deep breath, think about your mom.

496
00:24:15,494 --> 00:24:18,885
Uh, do you have any
direct flights to Agra?

497
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,901
Calm down.

498
00:24:23,902 --> 00:24:26,103
When have you ever know
someone to calm down

499
00:24:26,104 --> 00:24:28,139
when you tell them to calm down?

500
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:33,944
Could you turn the screen toward me

501
00:24:33,945 --> 00:24:38,082
so I can see the direct
flights to Agra, please?

502
00:25:10,415 --> 00:25:12,149
Oh, found it.

503
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:13,584
Download it.

504
00:25:30,502 --> 00:25:31,702
They're exiting the building.

505
00:25:32,971 --> 00:25:35,272
Hold it, hold it.

506
00:25:35,273 --> 00:25:36,574
Federal agents!

507
00:25:36,575 --> 00:25:38,442
Hold it right there. Put your
hands where I can see them.

508
00:25:38,443 --> 00:25:41,212
Get agents in there and sweep the place.

509
00:25:47,886 --> 00:25:50,321
Call it in, alright?

510
00:25:51,523 --> 00:25:53,357
Mr. Gardner, do you have a moment?

511
00:25:53,358 --> 00:25:55,092
Sure, what do you need?

512
00:25:55,093 --> 00:25:56,293
What am I doing wrong?

513
00:25:56,294 --> 00:25:57,661
What are you...

514
00:25:57,662 --> 00:25:59,196
I didn't know you were
doing anything wrong.

515
00:25:59,197 --> 00:26:01,031
There were 38 objections and I lost 34,

516
00:26:01,032 --> 00:26:02,867
- so what am I doing?
- Well, at the moment,

517
00:26:02,868 --> 00:26:05,102
what you're doing is playing the ref.

518
00:26:05,103 --> 00:26:06,971
- Tell me, teach me.
- You want me

519
00:26:06,972 --> 00:26:09,373
to tell you why I'm deciding against you?

520
00:26:09,374 --> 00:26:12,276
Yes, half of those objections
could have gone either way.

521
00:26:12,277 --> 00:26:13,177
That's not true.

522
00:26:13,178 --> 00:26:14,578
Where are you from, Chicago?

523
00:26:14,579 --> 00:26:16,146
Is this important for the lesson?

524
00:26:16,147 --> 00:26:17,248
It's important for a life lesson.

525
00:26:17,249 --> 00:26:18,849
Judge asks you a question, you answer.

526
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:20,384
You don't come back with another question.

527
00:26:20,385 --> 00:26:21,986
- Why?
- Because court is a lesson

528
00:26:21,987 --> 00:26:24,655
in humility, and you just came
back with another question.

529
00:26:24,656 --> 00:26:26,824
So you're deciding against
me because I'm not humble?

530
00:26:26,825 --> 00:26:31,695
No, I'm deciding against you
because you're wrong on the law,

531
00:26:31,696 --> 00:26:33,030
but life is not the classroom

532
00:26:33,031 --> 00:26:35,666
and judges decide things all
the time based on a whim...

533
00:26:35,667 --> 00:26:37,401
which attorneys they like, they trust.

534
00:26:37,402 --> 00:26:38,836
Oh, so you don't like me?

535
00:26:38,837 --> 00:26:40,938
Oh, my God, you're like a
three-year-old with the questions.

536
00:26:41,997 --> 00:26:44,608
I said the textbooks go out
the window when you're in court.

537
00:26:44,609 --> 00:26:47,111
Charm and finesse is just
as important as logic.

538
00:26:47,797 --> 00:26:50,347
Okay, so I need to work on my charm?

539
00:26:51,981 --> 00:26:53,851
To succeed in court,

540
00:26:53,852 --> 00:26:55,486
you need to work on everything.

541
00:26:56,166 --> 00:26:57,121
Okay.

542
00:26:58,556 --> 00:26:59,957
Then what?

543
00:27:02,561 --> 00:27:03,794
Let's see.

544
00:27:04,384 --> 00:27:05,391
Cross-examination.

545
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:13,637
What?

546
00:27:17,242 --> 00:27:19,276
Hey, I'm a big gamer.

547
00:27:19,807 --> 00:27:22,479
In college they used to
call me the thumb-Meister.

548
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,115
Grand theft auto, you know.

549
00:27:27,285 --> 00:27:28,403
Thanks, man.

550
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,924
What do you mean you're
not releasing Simran?

551
00:27:33,925 --> 00:27:34,892
We had a deal.

552
00:27:34,893 --> 00:27:35,993
Right, we had a deal.

553
00:27:35,994 --> 00:27:37,061
Your boy blew it apart.

554
00:27:37,062 --> 00:27:38,062
What?

555
00:27:38,063 --> 00:27:39,496
Amal got you the data.

556
00:27:39,497 --> 00:27:41,498
He also warned the Pujari
brothers to get out.

557
00:27:41,499 --> 00:27:42,933
- No, he didn't.
- Someone sent them a text.

558
00:27:42,934 --> 00:27:45,035
Well, you still got what you wanted.

559
00:27:45,036 --> 00:27:46,136
You made your arrest.

560
00:27:46,137 --> 00:27:47,237
I didn't want to bust the brothers.

561
00:27:47,238 --> 00:27:48,672
I wanted their buyer.

562
00:27:48,673 --> 00:27:50,808
We only arrested them so
they wouldn't take off on us.

563
00:27:50,809 --> 00:27:52,476
Now the whole operation is scattered.

564
00:27:52,477 --> 00:27:55,512
Because of your client, eight
months of work is shot to hell.

565
00:27:55,513 --> 00:27:57,247
And Simran, what about Simran?

566
00:27:57,248 --> 00:27:58,449
Deportation.

567
00:27:58,450 --> 00:27:59,817
Oh, come on, this... Ma'am,

568
00:27:59,818 --> 00:28:01,318
you know what this is? It's the law.

569
00:28:01,319 --> 00:28:03,954
She broke the law and now
she's paying the consequences.

570
00:28:14,632 --> 00:28:16,633
Mrs. Florrick.

571
00:28:16,634 --> 00:28:18,268
Gerald Kozko?

572
00:28:18,269 --> 00:28:19,837
Yes, I know who you are.

573
00:28:19,838 --> 00:28:21,005
I only need a minute.

574
00:28:21,006 --> 00:28:22,072
I'm leaving now.

575
00:28:22,073 --> 00:28:24,775
Please, I...

576
00:28:24,776 --> 00:28:27,311
I want you to give your husband a message.

577
00:28:27,312 --> 00:28:30,914
I want you to tell him that my
son had nothing to do with this.

578
00:28:32,095 --> 00:28:35,519
I was the one that made
the deal with Childs.

579
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,354
I'm cleaning up my mess.

580
00:28:37,905 --> 00:28:39,490
- My son is completely...
- No.

581
00:28:40,542 --> 00:28:41,325
Mrs. Florrick...

582
00:28:41,326 --> 00:28:44,328
No, that's it, Mr. Kozko,
I'm not your go-between.

583
00:28:44,329 --> 00:28:46,697
You want to give Peter a
message, pick up the phone.

584
00:28:46,698 --> 00:28:48,932
Mrs. Florrick, you don't realize...

585
00:28:48,933 --> 00:28:50,801
Yes, and I don't want to realize.

586
00:28:50,802 --> 00:28:52,636
I've had enough of everything.

587
00:28:52,637 --> 00:28:54,872
You don't understand;
I don't have anybody.

588
00:28:55,879 --> 00:28:56,840
You know what?

589
00:28:56,841 --> 00:28:58,208
I don't care.

590
00:29:00,279 --> 00:29:01,825
I don't know you.

591
00:29:02,614 --> 00:29:04,281
You don't know me.

592
00:29:04,282 --> 00:29:05,582
Help me.

593
00:29:07,263 --> 00:29:08,094
Okay,

594
00:29:08,753 --> 00:29:09,887
family meeting.

595
00:29:09,888 --> 00:29:10,954
We're going to settle some things.

596
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,911
From now on...

597
00:29:14,459 --> 00:29:16,727
we tell each other the truth.

598
00:29:16,728 --> 00:29:21,421
No more lying to the sheriff about
skateboards or to me about secret packages.

599
00:29:21,451 --> 00:29:22,694
Okay?

600
00:29:23,635 --> 00:29:26,370
- Where's dad?
- This isn't about him, this is about us.

601
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:29,316
So I'll go first.

602
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:34,178
I've been very angry with your father.

603
00:29:34,179 --> 00:29:36,013
I almost walked out a few nights ago,

604
00:29:36,014 --> 00:29:38,348
but we've decided to give it a go.

605
00:29:38,941 --> 00:29:40,250
In separate rooms?

606
00:29:40,251 --> 00:29:42,686
Yes, and you two will just
have to deal with that.

607
00:29:42,687 --> 00:29:44,455
You're almost grown-ups.

608
00:29:44,456 --> 00:29:47,324
You'll realize that adults
have complicated emotions.

609
00:29:48,756 --> 00:29:50,527
Zach, your turn.

610
00:29:50,528 --> 00:29:51,795
My turn?

611
00:29:51,796 --> 00:29:53,597
What's on your mind?

612
00:29:53,598 --> 00:29:55,199
Mom, it's really late.

613
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,967
I'm seeing Becca.

614
00:29:58,837 --> 00:30:01,205
Okay, this is progress.

615
00:30:02,407 --> 00:30:06,276
And I will be honest in telling
you that I don't like Becca,

616
00:30:06,837 --> 00:30:09,113
but I think you should bring her to dinner

617
00:30:09,114 --> 00:30:11,515
so we can have a proper introduction.

618
00:30:11,516 --> 00:30:12,683
Okay.

619
00:30:12,684 --> 00:30:14,151
Grace.

620
00:30:16,031 --> 00:30:17,421
Who's Will?

621
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:21,825
Will Gardner... My boss.

622
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:27,264
I heard you talking to him
on the phone a week ago.

623
00:30:27,265 --> 00:30:31,368
You were whispering at night.

624
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:34,938
He's my boss...

625
00:30:34,939 --> 00:30:37,808
and we used to know each other in college

626
00:30:37,809 --> 00:30:41,345
and we thought that we were
attracted to each other,

627
00:30:41,346 --> 00:30:42,546
but it's over.

628
00:30:43,094 --> 00:30:45,048
What's over?

629
00:30:45,559 --> 00:30:47,417
Thinking that we were
attracted to each other.

630
00:30:47,418 --> 00:30:49,219
But he's still your boss.

631
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:51,355
Yes. So what happened?

632
00:30:53,191 --> 00:30:56,160
Actually, that's all I
intend to share right now.

633
00:30:56,926 --> 00:30:59,163
Your father and I are agreeing

634
00:30:59,164 --> 00:31:03,400
to make this work and I have
agreed to trust you again,

635
00:31:03,401 --> 00:31:04,801
so good night.

636
00:31:08,873 --> 00:31:10,941
Sweet dreams.

637
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:13,677
It's getting to her.

638
00:31:13,678 --> 00:31:15,128
Definitely.

639
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:21,885
Hi.

640
00:31:21,886 --> 00:31:23,287
Yeah, it's me.

641
00:31:23,288 --> 00:31:24,388
You're working late.

642
00:31:24,389 --> 00:31:27,865
Yeah, on this good deed
someone saddled me with.

643
00:31:27,869 --> 00:31:29,293
Belkin won't budge; I already went to him.

644
00:31:29,294 --> 00:31:31,295
They weren't after the Pujari brothers.

645
00:31:31,296 --> 00:31:32,796
They were after their buyers.

646
00:31:32,797 --> 00:31:34,765
Now they're looking for the go-between.

647
00:31:34,766 --> 00:31:36,405
Really?

648
00:31:37,835 --> 00:31:40,671
Then maybe we have
something to negotiate with.

649
00:31:49,125 --> 00:31:52,227
Okay, go ahead.

650
00:31:53,005 --> 00:31:54,574
Did you threaten Kozko?

651
00:31:54,604 --> 00:31:55,638
Yes.

652
00:31:55,639 --> 00:31:57,406
Downstairs at lord of Christ?

653
00:31:57,407 --> 00:31:59,224
Yes.

654
00:32:00,377 --> 00:32:01,877
Do you want to know why?

655
00:32:02,946 --> 00:32:05,281
He was wearing a wire.

656
00:32:05,282 --> 00:32:07,917
He made a deal with Childs for immunity.

657
00:32:08,633 --> 00:32:10,085
And why'd he do that?

658
00:32:10,086 --> 00:32:11,153
I don't know why.

659
00:32:11,154 --> 00:32:14,423
Because you steered
investigations away from him?

660
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:17,259
Everything, Peter.

661
00:32:18,995 --> 00:32:21,330
I want to know everything.

662
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:31,740
Everybody has friends,
everybody has enemies.

663
00:32:31,741 --> 00:32:34,944
I did things for Kozko as a friend.

664
00:32:36,897 --> 00:32:38,581
That were illegal?

665
00:32:38,582 --> 00:32:41,650
No, but...

666
00:32:41,651 --> 00:32:43,852
The line gets fuzzy.

667
00:32:51,858 --> 00:32:53,896
Who paid for this?

668
00:32:53,897 --> 00:32:55,230
I did.

669
00:32:55,696 --> 00:32:58,000
Then why isn't the receipt in your name?

670
00:32:58,001 --> 00:33:00,269
I went to the store, Peter.

671
00:33:03,373 --> 00:33:06,075
I wanted to get you something nice...

672
00:33:06,076 --> 00:33:08,043
I didn't have the money.

673
00:33:08,044 --> 00:33:09,912
Kozko lent me the money.

674
00:33:09,913 --> 00:33:11,580
And that was illegal.

675
00:33:12,116 --> 00:33:14,950
That was... fuzzy.

676
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:18,454
Look, Alicia,

677
00:33:18,988 --> 00:33:20,556
I want to run again,

678
00:33:20,557 --> 00:33:23,692
but I want to do it right
this time, nothing fuzzy.

679
00:33:24,246 --> 00:33:26,689
And I only want to do
it if you're with me.

680
00:33:27,097 --> 00:33:29,298
If we're in this together.

681
00:33:33,069 --> 00:33:36,251
These? No, I don't know who handles these.

682
00:33:36,289 --> 00:33:39,074
They look like they were mounted
in a necklace or something.

683
00:33:39,075 --> 00:33:41,877
Well, your best bet
with jewelry is not here.

684
00:33:41,878 --> 00:33:43,479
Thanks for your time, anyway.

685
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,147
The box is another matter.

686
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:46,682
You recognize the box?

687
00:33:46,683 --> 00:33:47,916
It's a camphor box.

688
00:33:47,917 --> 00:33:51,687
It's sold down the street
at the Mundy bazaar.

689
00:33:51,688 --> 00:33:52,821
Thanks.

690
00:33:53,343 --> 00:33:57,545
All rise. The Honorable
Will Gardner presiding.

691
00:34:01,096 --> 00:34:03,165
Is the defense ready
with its first witness?

692
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:05,567
Yes, Your Honor. I just
have a quick motion first.

693
00:34:05,568 --> 00:34:06,568
Proceed.

694
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:12,474
Title 28, USC-455a provides:

695
00:34:12,475 --> 00:34:16,812
A judge must recuse himself in any
proceeding in which his impartiality

696
00:34:16,813 --> 00:34:18,147
may be reasonably questioned.

697
00:34:18,148 --> 00:34:20,616
The defense asks that you do so now.

698
00:34:20,617 --> 00:34:21,750
Recuse yourself.

699
00:34:22,305 --> 00:34:24,553
Ms. Cabrini, we've been through this.

700
00:34:24,554 --> 00:34:26,121
I'm not biased against you.

701
00:34:26,122 --> 00:34:28,057
I agree. You're biased for me.

702
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:29,758
Really?

703
00:34:29,759 --> 00:34:31,560
You're gonna have to explain that one.

704
00:34:31,561 --> 00:34:33,729
Well, yesterday after
court, you advised me

705
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:35,964
on how to cross-examine and question

706
00:34:35,965 --> 00:34:39,968
witnesses for this trial,
clearly demonstrating bias.

707
00:34:39,969 --> 00:34:41,203
You asked for advice.

708
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:42,438
United States v. Burger.

709
00:34:42,439 --> 00:34:44,339
If a reasonable person
knowing the relevant facts

710
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:47,109
would harbor doubts about
a judge's impartiality,

711
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:49,545
he must recuse himself.

712
00:34:49,546 --> 00:34:51,580
Motion denied, Ms. Cabrini.

713
00:34:51,581 --> 00:34:54,049
Why don't we take a break
for a minute, Mr. Gardner.

714
00:34:54,484 --> 00:34:56,585
Sadie, she set me up.

715
00:34:56,586 --> 00:34:59,188
Okay, I think we're in an
awkward area here, Your Honor.

716
00:34:59,189 --> 00:35:00,589
What? I didn't do anything wrong.

717
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:02,725
Thanks so much for your help.

718
00:35:02,726 --> 00:35:03,826
You believe her?

719
00:35:03,827 --> 00:35:05,428
I believe I'll take the robe.

720
00:35:06,096 --> 00:35:08,731
Yep. Men and 25-year-olds.

721
00:35:08,732 --> 00:35:10,566
Same thing happened to my ex.

722
00:35:11,126 --> 00:35:13,202
What are you talking about?

723
00:35:15,004 --> 00:35:17,973
We think these gems, they're
Kashmir blue sapphires,

724
00:35:17,974 --> 00:35:20,743
were used in payment for the I.D.'s

725
00:35:20,744 --> 00:35:24,079
if we can find the smuggler,
we can find the buyer.

726
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,081
And if you find the buyer?

727
00:35:26,601 --> 00:35:28,383
Then Belkin will get you a visa.

728
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:30,886
But they're deporting me on
the next transport. I know.

729
00:35:30,887 --> 00:35:33,255
My associates are still
running these sapphires down.

730
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:35,991
I... I don't know anybody
in India, Mrs. Florrick.

731
00:35:35,992 --> 00:35:38,093
My life... My life is here.

732
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:39,595
I know.

733
00:35:41,096 --> 00:35:44,433
Can I see Amal and Frida before I go?

734
00:35:45,502 --> 00:35:48,103
I'm... I'm working on it.

735
00:35:51,841 --> 00:35:53,375
Please, um...

736
00:35:53,376 --> 00:35:55,978
Mrs. Florrick, you have
the key to my apartment,

737
00:35:55,979 --> 00:35:57,946
no?

738
00:36:00,583 --> 00:36:02,851
I need a few items, and then...

739
00:36:02,852 --> 00:36:04,753
And the sentimental things.

740
00:36:10,426 --> 00:36:12,427
Yes, of course I will.

741
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:17,297
And will you tell Amal
it's not his fault, mm?

742
00:36:19,169 --> 00:36:20,298
Thank you.

743
00:36:47,648 --> 00:36:48,730
Cary?

744
00:36:48,731 --> 00:36:50,032
Hi. Can you hear me?

745
00:36:50,033 --> 00:36:51,834
Okay, I need you bring it to me.

746
00:36:51,835 --> 00:36:54,903
- What, the gems?
- No, the box. I need you to bring the box.

747
00:36:54,904 --> 00:36:56,438
Alright, alright, but
I'm just driving around

748
00:36:56,439 --> 00:36:58,574
in circles here... Little
India's a nightmare.

749
00:36:58,575 --> 00:37:00,909
I'll e-mail them to
your car, the directions.

750
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:03,478
Alright. Hold on, that's
my other line. Hello?

751
00:37:03,479 --> 00:37:05,447
Hi, Cary. Are you near Kalinda?

752
00:37:05,448 --> 00:37:07,716
No. I'm looking for her right now.

753
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:10,085
And ha-ha, very funny,
it's not about gaming.

754
00:37:10,086 --> 00:37:11,386
Wait, hold on a second.

755
00:37:12,427 --> 00:37:13,989
Alright, I got it. What do you need?

756
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:16,058
Tell her I think Simran's involved.

757
00:37:16,059 --> 00:37:18,594
The sapphires used to
pay the Pujari brothers,

758
00:37:18,595 --> 00:37:20,929
I found the same jewels in her apartment.

759
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:23,198
Damn it. Alright, well, I'll tell her.

760
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:27,078
Namaste.

761
00:37:27,102 --> 00:37:28,070
What did he say?

762
00:37:29,056 --> 00:37:30,973
I don't know. I don't speak Hindi.

763
00:37:30,974 --> 00:37:32,608
What do you mean, you don't Hindi?

764
00:37:33,066 --> 00:37:34,076
I didn't grow up in India.

765
00:37:34,077 --> 00:37:36,411
Do you speak English?

766
00:37:36,412 --> 00:37:39,815
No, no.

767
00:37:39,816 --> 00:37:43,518
Oh, seriously, Kalinda, where
is your cultural identity?

768
00:37:43,519 --> 00:37:46,021
Uh, I'm looking for a box like this.

769
00:37:46,022 --> 00:37:48,757
Ah...

770
00:37:50,326 --> 00:37:51,627
Ah, thank you.

771
00:37:51,628 --> 00:37:53,462
I don't think Simran was involved.

772
00:37:53,463 --> 00:37:55,621
What? You just get a hunch?

773
00:37:55,633 --> 00:37:56,944
No.

774
00:37:57,296 --> 00:37:58,248
Better.

775
00:38:16,781 --> 00:38:17,610
So,

776
00:38:17,613 --> 00:38:18,554
your back?

777
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:21,151
I'm back.

778
00:38:22,153 --> 00:38:24,521
Uh, did, uh, Hansel and Gretel get off?

779
00:38:24,522 --> 00:38:26,589
I don't know. I recused myself.

780
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:30,393
You recused yourself from the
prosecution of Hansel and Gretel?

781
00:38:31,495 --> 00:38:33,963
What, were you dating Gretel?

782
00:38:33,964 --> 00:38:36,332
For a few weeks. Bad time.

783
00:38:37,228 --> 00:38:38,154
What's that?

784
00:38:39,136 --> 00:38:42,338
Oh, that? A personal case, immigration.

785
00:38:42,339 --> 00:38:44,274
I'm letting them run with it.

786
00:38:44,275 --> 00:38:44,848
Excuse me.

787
00:38:45,236 --> 00:38:47,136
Someone to see you, Will... Giada Cabrini.

788
00:38:47,137 --> 00:38:48,304
No appointment.

789
00:38:48,305 --> 00:38:49,472
Send her in.

790
00:38:50,224 --> 00:38:51,774
Long lost love?

791
00:38:51,775 --> 00:38:53,743
No. A student.

792
00:38:53,744 --> 00:38:55,812
This should be interesting.

793
00:39:13,194 --> 00:39:14,664
Your Honor.

794
00:39:17,268 --> 00:39:19,102
Ms. Cabrini.

795
00:39:20,761 --> 00:39:21,838
I thought

796
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:23,506
I'd bring you some gingerbread.

797
00:39:24,297 --> 00:39:25,708
So, did you win?

798
00:39:25,709 --> 00:39:27,210
No, actually.

799
00:39:27,211 --> 00:39:29,679
To be honest, I think they did it.

800
00:39:31,464 --> 00:39:34,249
Very clever, getting me recused.

801
00:39:34,272 --> 00:39:36,540
Yes, well, you were biased.

802
00:39:37,229 --> 00:39:38,612
And you're here because...?

803
00:39:39,068 --> 00:39:40,461
I want to take you to dinner.

804
00:39:41,693 --> 00:39:43,528
No hard feelings.

805
00:39:44,032 --> 00:39:45,530
How old are you?

806
00:39:45,531 --> 00:39:47,965
25. How old are you?

807
00:39:47,966 --> 00:39:49,433
Not 25.

808
00:39:49,434 --> 00:39:51,903
Well, I won't hold that against you.

809
00:39:54,448 --> 00:39:56,307
Come on, I'll buy.

810
00:39:56,308 --> 00:39:57,669
Let me think about it.

811
00:39:58,444 --> 00:39:59,645
Okay.

812
00:40:00,769 --> 00:40:01,855
I'll wait.

813
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:07,718
You're wasting your time.

814
00:40:07,719 --> 00:40:10,488
Deportations fall under I.C.E.

815
00:40:10,489 --> 00:40:13,291
The U.S. attorney's office can't
countermand their order of removal.

816
00:40:13,292 --> 00:40:15,226
We can still authorize an S-1 visa.

817
00:40:15,227 --> 00:40:16,961
A snitch visa?

818
00:40:16,962 --> 00:40:17,883
For whom, the mother?

819
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:20,932
You want the Pujaris' contact
with organized crime, right?

820
00:40:21,834 --> 00:40:25,503
Well, if Simran gets
deported, so does the name.

821
00:40:29,241 --> 00:40:31,382
I seem to be missing something.

822
00:40:35,964 --> 00:40:39,617
I'm open to a new proffer, but
I'll need to see a statement.

823
00:40:59,869 --> 00:41:01,437
I sacrificed.

824
00:41:02,450 --> 00:41:03,993
Now it's your turn.

825
00:41:13,952 --> 00:41:18,423
I was the courier between the
Pujari brothers and their buyers.

826
00:41:20,977 --> 00:41:23,897
They offered me a lot of money to do it.

827
00:41:26,602 --> 00:41:29,260
They threatened me if I told anyone.

828
00:41:31,141 --> 00:41:33,053
So I kept it from my mother...

829
00:41:34,302 --> 00:41:35,700
and Amal.

830
00:41:40,629 --> 00:41:43,265
I was the one who texted the
brothers you were watching.

831
00:41:43,276 --> 00:41:45,483
Okay. That's enough.

832
00:41:47,386 --> 00:41:49,553
You get the rest when you get the visa.

833
00:41:54,593 --> 00:41:56,509
Give me a few hours.

834
00:42:05,824 --> 00:42:07,800
She'll get jail time, you know.

835
00:42:08,273 --> 00:42:09,945
She knows.

836
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:34,039
- Thank you.
- No problem.

837
00:42:42,161 --> 00:42:43,194
That's nice.

838
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:45,387
Isn't that nice?

839
00:42:46,979 --> 00:42:48,913
No big case, no video games...

840
00:42:48,914 --> 00:42:50,392
we just did some good here.

841
00:42:50,425 --> 00:42:52,252
Actually, Alicia and I did some good.

842
00:42:52,304 --> 00:42:53,792
You just drove the car.

843
00:42:53,806 --> 00:42:55,597
Oh, that is not fair.

844
00:42:55,598 --> 00:42:57,080
- I'm the one who found...
- Shh, shh, shh.

845
00:42:57,314 --> 00:42:58,747
What is it?

846
00:42:58,748 --> 00:43:01,584
- Today a car we believed... ...was found abandoned...
- Hold on.

847
00:43:01,585 --> 00:43:03,701
I'm gonna play it back.

848
00:43:04,588 --> 00:43:05,521
Patience.

849
00:43:05,522 --> 00:43:07,223
And now back to our headline news.

850
00:43:07,224 --> 00:43:10,793
Chicago real estate developer
Gerald Kozko is missing,

851
00:43:10,794 --> 00:43:12,761
in fear to have taken his own life.

852
00:43:12,762 --> 00:43:15,631
Authorities fear Mr. Kozko
may have committed suicide

853
00:43:15,632 --> 00:43:19,969
by jumping from the Des Plaines
River Bridge just outside the loop.

854
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:24,540
Police found his abandoned car parked
midway across the bridge earlier today.

855
00:43:24,541 --> 00:43:27,443
There are no witnesses, and
no body has yet been recovered,

856
00:43:27,444 --> 00:43:29,545
but police boats and
divers continue to search...

857
00:43:29,546 --> 00:43:31,253
Mom! Dinner!

858
00:43:31,301 --> 00:43:33,699
Hey, babe, we're just sitting down.

859
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:44,700
