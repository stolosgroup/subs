1
00:00:01,107 --> 00:00:02,941
WILL: Why are you shaking
your head, Mr. Gross?

2
00:00:02,942 --> 00:00:04,477
I don't know, the usual reasons:

3
00:00:04,478 --> 00:00:06,912
Disbelief, incredulity, disappointment.

4
00:00:07,013 --> 00:00:10,182
Ah, I must be endangering the future.

5
00:00:10,183 --> 00:00:12,750
No, just being a bit melodramatic.

6
00:00:12,751 --> 00:00:14,718
So, you never tweaked the algorithm?

7
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:16,954
Chummie the Squirrel
just acts on his own?

8
00:00:16,955 --> 00:00:19,757
No, I didn't say that.

9
00:00:19,758 --> 00:00:21,392
But you said you
couldn't impact the results.

10
00:00:21,393 --> 00:00:23,276
Yes, but the algorithm needs

11
00:00:23,277 --> 00:00:25,646
almost daily attention
and, uh, revision.

12
00:00:25,647 --> 00:00:27,580
WILL: I see. And why
would you revise it?

13
00:00:27,581 --> 00:00:29,548
GROSS: For one thing,
to avoid spam.

14
00:00:29,549 --> 00:00:32,618
Spammers are constantly trying
to game the search results.

15
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:36,388
So we adapt the algorithm
to avoid that.

16
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:43,145
(Elevator bell dings)

17
00:00:46,616 --> 00:00:48,617
ALICIA:
Deena Lampard.

18
00:00:55,441 --> 00:00:57,209
ALICIA: It should only
take a minute more.

19
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,678
I recognize you both from the trial.

20
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:02,380
You work for Neil Gross's law firm?

21
00:01:02,381 --> 00:01:04,415
Yes. He hates
you guys.

22
00:01:04,416 --> 00:01:07,351
May I ask you...
why are you here?

23
00:01:07,352 --> 00:01:08,352
Good question.

24
00:01:08,353 --> 00:01:09,620
Why are we here, Dad?

25
00:01:09,621 --> 00:01:12,190
I'd rather wait for the lawyer.

26
00:01:12,191 --> 00:01:13,524
She's a lawyer, just like me.

27
00:01:13,525 --> 00:01:15,159
My dad likes male lawyers.

28
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,093
MR. LAMPARD: My daughter
likes acting like

29
00:01:17,094 --> 00:01:19,396
I'm not in the room.
(Laughing)

30
00:01:19,397 --> 00:01:21,398
Mr. Lampard, hello.

31
00:01:21,399 --> 00:01:22,432
Ms. Lampard.

32
00:01:22,433 --> 00:01:23,900
I'm David Lee, family law.

33
00:01:23,901 --> 00:01:25,902
I see you've met Alicia and Kalinda.

34
00:01:26,403 --> 00:01:29,306
How may we help you today?

35
00:01:29,307 --> 00:01:30,507
Here, help yourself.

36
00:01:30,508 --> 00:01:31,641
Thank you, no.

37
00:01:31,642 --> 00:01:32,774
Uh, well, let's see.

38
00:01:32,775 --> 00:01:34,210
Uh, my daughter needs a second opinion.

39
00:01:34,211 --> 00:01:36,111
Regarding?

40
00:01:38,648 --> 00:01:40,516
Okay. What is it?

41
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:41,483
It's a prenup.

42
00:01:41,484 --> 00:01:42,685
I see.

43
00:01:42,686 --> 00:01:44,753
And who is your daughter
intending on marrying?

44
00:01:44,754 --> 00:01:46,121
Neil Gross.

45
00:01:48,757 --> 00:01:51,426
Neil Gross, president of Chumhum?

46
00:01:51,427 --> 00:01:52,827
Yes.

47
00:01:52,828 --> 00:01:54,962
- The ninth richest man in America.
- Yes.

48
00:01:54,963 --> 00:01:57,432
KALINDA: Who gave you
your first opinion, Deena?

49
00:01:57,433 --> 00:01:58,999
You said you wanted a second.

50
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,002
Longcraine & Church.
(Laughing)

51
00:02:02,003 --> 00:02:03,671
Mr. Gross's law firm.

52
00:02:03,672 --> 00:02:06,273
Yes, and my firm.
They thought I should sign it.

53
00:02:06,274 --> 00:02:07,674
(Laughing):
Yes, of course they did.

54
00:02:07,675 --> 00:02:09,243
MR. LAMPARD:
We're middle-class people, Mr. Lee.

55
00:02:09,244 --> 00:02:10,477
We don't have much money.

56
00:02:10,478 --> 00:02:12,312
And Deena is paying off
her student loans.

57
00:02:12,313 --> 00:02:13,980
Dad, it's not about that.

58
00:02:13,981 --> 00:02:16,383
I know.
But I want you protected.

59
00:02:16,384 --> 00:02:18,652
DAVID: Well, that's
why we're here:

60
00:02:18,653 --> 00:02:20,820
To protect you.

61
00:02:20,821 --> 00:02:22,288
It's a travesty.

62
00:02:22,289 --> 00:02:23,623
If they divorce, she gets nothing

63
00:02:23,624 --> 00:02:25,125
and she has to immolate herself

64
00:02:25,126 --> 00:02:26,893
on an altar of Chumhum's choosing.

65
00:02:26,894 --> 00:02:28,361
There's no contingency here?

66
00:02:28,362 --> 00:02:30,429
No, but she's marrying
the ninth richest man

67
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,464
in the country.

68
00:02:31,465 --> 00:02:33,532
We do right by her,
we get the business.

69
00:02:33,533 --> 00:02:35,034
Gross will never
bring his business here.

70
00:02:35,035 --> 00:02:36,202
He's made that clear.

71
00:02:36,203 --> 00:02:37,335
No, her business.

72
00:02:37,336 --> 00:02:38,804
We write this up correctly,

73
00:02:38,805 --> 00:02:40,538
and we'll get some kind of

74
00:02:40,539 --> 00:02:42,674
Bill & Melinda Gates
charity in her name.

75
00:02:42,675 --> 00:02:43,308
She'll bring it here.

76
00:02:43,309 --> 00:02:44,476
Is that what she wants?

77
00:02:44,477 --> 00:02:46,678
She's 28.
She doesn't know what she wants.

78
00:02:46,679 --> 00:02:48,213
She's in love.

79
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:52,617
Well, not to put
too fine a point on this,

80
00:02:52,618 --> 00:02:54,518
but, time's up in bankruptcy court

81
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:57,554
and we're only halfway
to the $60 million we need.

82
00:02:57,555 --> 00:02:59,523
If we want to argue for an extension,

83
00:02:59,524 --> 00:03:01,558
we need to show the court
some progress.

84
00:03:01,559 --> 00:03:03,027
DAVID:
Well, the fiancée

85
00:03:03,028 --> 00:03:05,029
of the ninth richest man is progress.

86
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,197
I'm doing my job.

87
00:03:06,198 --> 00:03:07,531
You two do yours.

88
00:03:11,302 --> 00:03:12,903
Alicia, do you mind?

89
00:03:12,904 --> 00:03:14,304
Could you close the door?

90
00:03:16,774 --> 00:03:18,374
Why don't you go ahead and sit.

91
00:03:20,544 --> 00:03:22,545
If this is about
the extension work, it's ready.

92
00:03:22,546 --> 00:03:24,947
No, no, no, we're... we're fine.

93
00:03:24,948 --> 00:03:28,050
Sorry to be so melodramatic, but, um...

94
00:03:28,751 --> 00:03:29,484
Do you want to?

95
00:03:29,485 --> 00:03:30,953
No, go ahead.

96
00:03:32,422 --> 00:03:35,724
Jonas Stern, about a lifetime ago,

97
00:03:35,725 --> 00:03:38,627
sat me down in a room,
not unlike this one,

98
00:03:38,628 --> 00:03:40,262
and offered me a cigar.

99
00:03:40,263 --> 00:03:41,830
I said no, of course.

100
00:03:42,331 --> 00:03:44,165
But then he said
the following--

101
00:03:44,566 --> 00:03:46,501
Unfortunately, I can't do his voice.

102
00:03:46,502 --> 00:03:47,536
Thank God.

103
00:03:47,537 --> 00:03:48,770
Anyway, he said,

104
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:52,207
"After I tell you
what I'm about to tell you,

105
00:03:52,908 --> 00:03:56,110
"I want you to go home,
take your phone off the hook

106
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:57,545
"and sit for a moment.

107
00:03:58,046 --> 00:04:00,013
"And feel proud of yourself.

108
00:04:01,014 --> 00:04:03,317
"And then I want you
to go out and get drunk.

109
00:04:03,318 --> 00:04:05,686
"Or do something you would never do:

110
00:04:05,687 --> 00:04:07,988
"Buy a sports car, go sailing,

111
00:04:07,989 --> 00:04:09,156
go to the track."

112
00:04:09,157 --> 00:04:10,825
I did go to the track, by the way.

113
00:04:10,826 --> 00:04:12,727
I went windsurfing...
unsuccessfully.

114
00:04:12,728 --> 00:04:15,762
(Chuckles)

115
00:04:15,763 --> 00:04:18,164
Anyway, this moment
is your moment, Alicia.

116
00:04:18,665 --> 00:04:21,534
We want you to join us
as an equity partner.

117
00:04:22,335 --> 00:04:24,036
Oh, my God.

118
00:04:24,037 --> 00:04:26,138
Yes, what you've done here
is extraordinary.

119
00:04:26,139 --> 00:04:27,907
You're...

120
00:04:28,908 --> 00:04:31,109
- you're kidding.
- No.

121
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:33,245
We want you to join the ranks

122
00:04:33,246 --> 00:04:34,713
of our highest echelon.

123
00:04:34,714 --> 00:04:37,916
I... I don't know what to say.

124
00:04:37,917 --> 00:04:39,284
Say you're happy.

125
00:04:39,985 --> 00:04:41,820
I'm happy.
(Laughing)

126
00:04:41,821 --> 00:04:42,788
I'm...

127
00:04:42,789 --> 00:04:45,156
I'm relieved.

128
00:04:46,657 --> 00:04:48,893
You don't know what
a roller coaster this has been.

129
00:04:48,894 --> 00:04:49,894
And for the firm as well.

130
00:04:50,695 --> 00:04:51,996
Oh, I thought this would take years.

131
00:04:51,997 --> 00:04:53,431
It's a credit to you, Alicia.

132
00:04:53,432 --> 00:04:54,365
You've been amazing here.

133
00:04:54,366 --> 00:04:55,566
Anyway, think about it.

134
00:04:55,567 --> 00:04:56,901
No need to rush into it.

135
00:04:56,902 --> 00:04:59,404
Take until the end of the week,
and then say yes or no.

136
00:04:59,405 --> 00:05:00,371
Does anyone ever say no?

137
00:05:00,372 --> 00:05:01,438
I don't know.
I can't remember

138
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:03,440
the last time we sat an associate down.

139
00:05:03,441 --> 00:05:04,775
Well, I'm not going to say no.

140
00:05:04,776 --> 00:05:07,444
(Laughs) Well, give yourself
until the end of the week.

141
00:05:07,445 --> 00:05:10,280
And good luck
with this Mrs. Gross case.

142
00:05:10,281 --> 00:05:11,915
Sounds promising.

143
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:13,283
Thank you.

144
00:05:13,994 --> 00:05:15,619
Thank you so much.

145
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:18,254
Ouch.

146
00:05:22,492 --> 00:05:24,293
Alicia, are you heading to bankruptcy?

147
00:05:24,594 --> 00:05:25,895
What?
I don't think so.

148
00:05:25,896 --> 00:05:27,329
(Elevator bell dings)

149
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:29,265
- Is everything all right?
- Yes.

150
00:05:36,238 --> 00:05:39,206
DIANE: We have cut our debt
in half, your Honor.

151
00:05:39,207 --> 00:05:40,942
In five months,

152
00:05:40,943 --> 00:05:42,577
we have gone from owing $60 million

153
00:05:42,578 --> 00:05:44,178
to owing now only 30.

154
00:05:44,179 --> 00:05:45,413
29.5.

155
00:05:45,414 --> 00:05:47,014
That is the difficulty
here, your Honor.

156
00:05:47,015 --> 00:05:49,484
We have a trustee who thinks
of us as a decimal point.

157
00:05:49,485 --> 00:05:52,019
JUDGE:
Okay, thank you.

158
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,354
Mr. Gardner, Ms. Lockhart,

159
00:05:53,355 --> 00:05:54,956
you're looking for another
five-month extension?

160
00:05:54,957 --> 00:05:56,190
Not another
five-month extension;

161
00:05:56,191 --> 00:05:57,724
A single five-month
extension.

162
00:05:57,725 --> 00:05:59,193
But yes.

163
00:05:59,194 --> 00:06:00,661
Mr. Hayden,
tell me why I shouldn't

164
00:06:00,662 --> 00:06:02,830
extend this fairly arbitrary deadline.

165
00:06:02,831 --> 00:06:05,632
Well, I didn't
think of it as arbitrary.

166
00:06:05,633 --> 00:06:07,767
And I would like
the creditor to advance

167
00:06:07,768 --> 00:06:09,436
his own argument.

168
00:06:09,437 --> 00:06:11,071
Mr. Canning.

169
00:06:13,741 --> 00:06:16,576
Your Honor, hello.

170
00:06:16,577 --> 00:06:17,777
I'm Louis Canning.

171
00:06:18,278 --> 00:06:21,314
I, uh, would like to thank you for...

172
00:06:21,315 --> 00:06:23,915
taking the time to listen to me today.

173
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:25,351
I've been in other courtrooms

174
00:06:25,352 --> 00:06:26,918
where the voice of the handicapped

175
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:30,222
is often shunted aside and ignored.

176
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,623
But not here.

177
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:33,359
That's the great thing about America.

178
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,460
Dear God.

179
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:35,794
CANNING: These
movements that you see

180
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:37,529
are called tardive dyskinesia.

181
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,030
Your Honor, excuse me.
Relevance.

182
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:40,331
JUDGE:
Ms. Lockhart, please.

183
00:06:40,332 --> 00:06:43,368
I think we can tolerate this
purely as an explanation.

184
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:45,136
CANNING:
Thank you, Your Honor.

185
00:06:45,137 --> 00:06:46,937
I would argue against this extension

186
00:06:46,938 --> 00:06:48,739
for one simple reason:

187
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:51,109
The money that I collect
from Lockhart/Gardner

188
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:53,111
will go directly
to neurological research

189
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:55,045
into syndromes like my own.

190
00:06:55,546 --> 00:06:57,080
So, every day payment is delayed

191
00:06:57,081 --> 00:06:58,648
is another day that a child

192
00:06:58,649 --> 00:06:59,649
wakes up without a future.

193
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:00,984
Your Honor,
Mr. Canning should be

194
00:07:00,985 --> 00:07:02,452
rejoicing in our resurgence.

195
00:07:02,453 --> 00:07:03,887
If we're liquidated today, he'll only

196
00:07:03,888 --> 00:07:05,422
receive 50 cents on the dollar.

197
00:07:05,423 --> 00:07:07,724
In five months, he'll
get his full 100%.

198
00:07:07,725 --> 00:07:09,559
That's only if the debt
is repaid in full.

199
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,727
Yes, which is why we intend
to present evidence

200
00:07:11,728 --> 00:07:13,729
showing our obligations
can be fulfilled

201
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:14,830
in five months time.

202
00:07:14,831 --> 00:07:16,432
I agree.

203
00:07:16,433 --> 00:07:17,833
Please have your arguments

204
00:07:17,834 --> 00:07:19,035
ready by tomorrow.

205
00:07:19,036 --> 00:07:20,869
(Gavel slams)

206
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:22,905
WILL:
Uh-oh.

207
00:07:22,906 --> 00:07:24,973
Look who's working together.

208
00:07:26,276 --> 00:07:28,376
MAN: I just want
to ask God for one thing...

209
00:07:28,377 --> 00:07:30,879
...be true,
let our minds be clear.

210
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,348
And as we discuss these candidates...

211
00:07:33,349 --> 00:07:35,083
- There. - What there?
There's nothing there.

212
00:07:35,084 --> 00:07:36,852
Everyone's head is bowed
except for Maddie's.

213
00:07:36,853 --> 00:07:38,820
Come on, this is not the South.

214
00:07:38,821 --> 00:07:40,923
Doesn't have to be the
South for it to resonate.

215
00:07:40,924 --> 00:07:42,657
Voters don't like radicals.

216
00:07:42,658 --> 00:07:44,191
They don't like rudeness.

217
00:07:44,192 --> 00:07:45,996
That is rudeness,
and it plays downstate.

218
00:07:45,997 --> 00:07:47,127
Eli, is Peter here?

219
00:07:47,128 --> 00:07:49,363
Oh, no, we had to send him downstate

220
00:07:49,364 --> 00:07:50,697
at the last minute.
What do you need?

221
00:07:50,698 --> 00:07:52,531
- Ms. Florrick, hello.
- Hello.

222
00:07:52,532 --> 00:07:54,734
Could you have him call me
when he gets in?

223
00:07:54,735 --> 00:07:56,070
Sure.
Is everything all right?

224
00:07:56,471 --> 00:07:57,771
Yes.

225
00:07:57,972 --> 00:08:01,474
Alicia, uh, could I ask you
a quick question?

226
00:08:01,725 --> 00:08:03,242
When you were friends
with Maddie Hayward,

227
00:08:03,243 --> 00:08:04,778
did you ever talk about religion?

228
00:08:04,779 --> 00:08:06,579
Did we ever talk about religion?

229
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:08,548
Belief in God.

230
00:08:08,549 --> 00:08:10,183
What'd she say?
She an agnostic?

231
00:08:10,184 --> 00:08:12,552
Oh, I don't know if I feel
comfortable with this, Eli.

232
00:08:12,553 --> 00:08:14,120
Oh, she's used stuff you told her

233
00:08:14,121 --> 00:08:15,254
in confidence against Peter.

234
00:08:15,255 --> 00:08:17,656
Yes, but I...

235
00:08:18,457 --> 00:08:19,459
She's an atheist.

236
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:20,993
She told you that?

237
00:08:20,994 --> 00:08:21,994
It's not that weird, Eli.

238
00:08:21,995 --> 00:08:23,261
Oh, I know. I'm not
saying anything.

239
00:08:23,262 --> 00:08:24,929
But she told you she was an atheist?

240
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:26,465
Yes. Why?

241
00:08:26,466 --> 00:08:27,532
No reason.

242
00:08:27,533 --> 00:08:29,501
I'll tell Peter you came by.

243
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,974
Ah, there you are.

244
00:08:35,975 --> 00:08:37,642
I was wondering
where you wandered off to.

245
00:08:37,643 --> 00:08:38,942
Just went on a lunch break,

246
00:08:38,943 --> 00:08:40,544
and bought a few things.

247
00:08:40,545 --> 00:08:42,846
How nice for you.

248
00:08:42,847 --> 00:08:43,947
Deena signed on.

249
00:08:43,948 --> 00:08:45,616
Gross and his lawyers
are coming over tomorrow

250
00:08:45,617 --> 00:08:46,617
to start negotiating.

251
00:08:46,618 --> 00:08:47,585
Good.

252
00:08:47,586 --> 00:08:49,286
And another thing--
I heard Will

253
00:08:49,287 --> 00:08:52,156
and Diane sat you down
and had the talk.

254
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:53,790
Congratulations.
Good news.

255
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:54,924
Thank you.

256
00:08:54,925 --> 00:08:55,958
It was unexpected.

257
00:08:55,959 --> 00:08:57,427
Yes, well, now, here's the thing:

258
00:08:57,428 --> 00:08:58,961
They might not have talked to you

259
00:08:58,962 --> 00:09:00,796
about the capital contribution.

260
00:09:00,797 --> 00:09:02,698
It's required of all equity partners.

261
00:09:02,699 --> 00:09:04,734
$600,000. And I know

262
00:09:04,735 --> 00:09:06,769
that sounds like a lot of money,

263
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:08,505
but we have reasonable terms.

264
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:10,539
Usually 50% up front

265
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:14,143
and another 50
deliverable upon bonuses.

266
00:09:16,346 --> 00:09:18,480
I'm-I'm sorry. What?

267
00:09:18,481 --> 00:09:19,981
The capital contribution.

268
00:09:19,982 --> 00:09:21,283
It's your investment in the firm.

269
00:09:21,284 --> 00:09:23,418
Every equity partner
has to throw into the pot.

270
00:09:23,419 --> 00:09:26,054
That means you're invested in the firm,

271
00:09:26,055 --> 00:09:28,456
the firm's invested in you.

272
00:09:29,658 --> 00:09:33,461
Sorry... $600,000?

273
00:09:33,462 --> 00:09:34,728
(Chuckling):
Yes, I know.

274
00:09:34,729 --> 00:09:36,730
It sounds like a lot of money.

275
00:09:36,731 --> 00:09:38,599
My God, when I was
a fourth-year,

276
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,501
it sounded like all
the money in the world.

277
00:09:40,502 --> 00:09:42,502
But you only need to put up half.

278
00:09:42,503 --> 00:09:44,171
The other, with interest,

279
00:09:44,172 --> 00:09:46,540
is usually payable within

280
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:49,276
three bonus cycles, maybe more,

281
00:09:49,277 --> 00:09:51,344
depending on how we're doing.

282
00:09:51,945 --> 00:09:53,213
So...

283
00:09:53,814 --> 00:09:55,014
any questions?

284
00:09:55,265 --> 00:09:56,264
Six...

285
00:09:57,265 --> 00:09:58,765
hundred...

286
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:00,686
thousand?

287
00:10:00,687 --> 00:10:02,754
Yes, membership has its privileges,

288
00:10:02,755 --> 00:10:05,023
but first, you need to be a member.

289
00:10:05,024 --> 00:10:06,158
(Chuckles)

290
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:07,226
Any other questions?

291
00:10:07,227 --> 00:10:09,229
I...

292
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:12,530
No.

293
00:10:12,931 --> 00:10:14,065
Good.

294
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:16,534
Again, congratulations.

295
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:24,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

296

<font color="#ff8c00">www.addic7ed.com</font>

297
00:10:41,896 --> 00:10:43,897
WILL: Kalinda, just give us
a month. That's all.

298
00:10:44,398 --> 00:10:46,149
No.
Thanks, though.

299
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:47,350
We're cash-poor at the moment.

300
00:10:47,351 --> 00:10:50,052
If this bankruptcy extension
goes our way, we won't be.

301
00:10:50,053 --> 00:10:51,486
Good.
But, in the meantime,

302
00:10:51,987 --> 00:10:55,757
I was promised a promotion
and a five percent increase.

303
00:10:56,258 --> 00:10:57,926
You really think this is going to work?

304
00:10:57,927 --> 00:10:59,260
Excuse me?

305
00:10:59,261 --> 00:11:00,995
Look, nothing your firm
does in that room

306
00:11:00,996 --> 00:11:02,664
is going to convince me to hire you.

307
00:11:02,665 --> 00:11:04,699
Mr. Gross, maybe
you didn't notice,

308
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,233
- I'm in a meeting.
- You are not gonna

309
00:11:06,234 --> 00:11:07,868
get my business, and if you do anything

310
00:11:07,869 --> 00:11:10,103
- to come between me and Deena...
- I'm in litigation,

311
00:11:10,104 --> 00:11:11,238
not family law.

312
00:11:11,239 --> 00:11:12,640
I didn't solicit your wife's business,

313
00:11:12,641 --> 00:11:14,775
nor am I involved in her negotiation.

314
00:11:15,276 --> 00:11:17,578
So get the hell out of my office.

315
00:11:20,914 --> 00:11:22,615
You got your raise.

316
00:11:22,616 --> 00:11:24,283
Keep track of that.

317
00:11:24,284 --> 00:11:25,918
Happy to.

318
00:11:26,754 --> 00:11:28,888
DAVID:
Ah, here's the groom.

319
00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:31,858
Can we start now?
Is everybody happy?

320
00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:33,092
Ecstatic.

321
00:11:33,093 --> 00:11:34,494
Are you okay with this?

322
00:11:34,495 --> 00:11:36,762
We just need to go through the motions.

323
00:11:36,763 --> 00:11:38,196
Yeah. I know it makes sense.

324
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,899
I just... I want you
to be comfortable, baby.

325
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,033
Deena, why don't you have a seat here?

326
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:44,002
- No, no, babe, sit here.
- I'm okay here.

327
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:46,238
DAVID: We just have
a few amendments to make

328
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:49,375
to the fine work done
by your firm, Rochelle.

329
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:50,876
We would suggest

330
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:52,910
redrafting pages two through,

331
00:11:52,911 --> 00:11:54,679
let's see... 68.

332
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:57,014
- We're fine with the cover sheet.
- We wanted

333
00:11:57,015 --> 00:11:58,516
to redraft anyway--
we feel like Mr. Gross

334
00:11:58,517 --> 00:12:00,918
is being far too lenient financially.
(David chuckles)

335
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:01,986
ALICIA:
Our first concern

336
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:03,654
is jurisdiction-- Texas?

337
00:12:03,655 --> 00:12:05,823
Mr. Gross has a ranch
outside of Austin.

338
00:12:05,824 --> 00:12:07,625
And Chumhum's technical
support facility is there.

339
00:12:07,626 --> 00:12:09,993
CARY: But Mr. Gross isn't--
he hasn't been there

340
00:12:09,994 --> 00:12:13,062
since the two-hour stopover
at DFW en route to Paris,

341
00:12:13,063 --> 00:12:14,998
- March 2009.
- That's not dispositive.

342
00:12:14,999 --> 00:12:17,066
DAVID:
But this is.

343
00:12:17,067 --> 00:12:19,803
The couple will be domiciled
in Mountain View, California,

344
00:12:19,804 --> 00:12:21,438
which is the location
of Chumhum's headquarters.

345
00:12:21,439 --> 00:12:22,606
ALICIA: California
law is friendlier

346
00:12:22,607 --> 00:12:23,740
to the more dependent spouse.

347
00:12:23,741 --> 00:12:25,140
Texas is not so friendly.

348
00:12:25,141 --> 00:12:27,777
ROCHELLE: Actually, Mrs. Florrick,
why don't you tell her

349
00:12:27,778 --> 00:12:29,812
the real reason
you want California law:

350
00:12:29,813 --> 00:12:32,448
- It's the seven-day rule.
NEIL: What's the seven-day rule?

351
00:12:32,449 --> 00:12:34,249
DAVID:
Both parties must have

352
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,619
the final agreement in hand
for seven days before signing.

353
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:37,953
ROCHELLE:
Or it's unenforceable.

354
00:12:37,954 --> 00:12:39,655
The prenup is voided.

355
00:12:39,656 --> 00:12:40,923
Our wedding's in nine days.

356
00:12:40,924 --> 00:12:42,391
Exactly.
So we have

357
00:12:42,392 --> 00:12:45,027
- 48 hours to hammer this out.
DAVID: Then let's make a deal.

358
00:12:45,028 --> 00:12:47,996
48 hours-- God made plants
and animals in 48 hours.

359
00:12:47,997 --> 00:12:49,298
ROCHELLE: They are
trying to hold a gun

360
00:12:49,299 --> 00:12:51,566
- to our head, Deena.
CARY: It's a gun to both of our heads.

361
00:12:51,567 --> 00:12:52,767
It's equal pressure on both parties.

362
00:12:52,768 --> 00:12:53,969
Yes, but which party suffers

363
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:55,203
if the prenup is altered?

364
00:12:55,204 --> 00:12:56,671
Both parties suffer,
given that Mr. Gross

365
00:12:56,672 --> 00:12:58,272
and Deena want a mutually
satisfactory agreement.

366
00:12:58,273 --> 00:13:00,541
(Cell phone ringing) We don't
have the time to hammer it out.

367
00:13:00,542 --> 00:13:01,608
CARY:
We're here to represent...

368
00:13:01,609 --> 00:13:03,844
DAVID: This is
absolutely ridiculous.

369
00:13:03,845 --> 00:13:05,346
(Arguing continues)

370
00:13:05,347 --> 00:13:07,681
Mr. Connolly. Yes.

371
00:13:07,682 --> 00:13:10,551
$600,000. I know.

372
00:13:10,552 --> 00:13:14,020
The question is: Can I
borrow against my mortgage?

373
00:13:14,021 --> 00:13:16,189
A cosigner

374
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:18,391
Who's the cosigner?

375
00:13:18,392 --> 00:13:21,328
Oh. No, I forgot.

376
00:13:21,329 --> 00:13:23,596
Mr. Florrick.

377
00:13:23,597 --> 00:13:25,065
(Arguing continues) Look!

378
00:13:25,066 --> 00:13:26,433
(Arguing stops)

379
00:13:26,434 --> 00:13:27,968
Look, this is academic.

380
00:13:27,969 --> 00:13:29,969
We are never going to get a divorce.

381
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:31,971
- 'Course not.
- DAVID: No, we share your optimism,

382
00:13:31,972 --> 00:13:35,140
but this contract
is about worst-case scenarios.

383
00:13:35,141 --> 00:13:37,509
- If Texas law governs...
DEENA: It's okay.

384
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:39,744
Texas law is fine.

385
00:13:39,745 --> 00:13:41,180
DEENA: Let's just move on.
- Perfect.

386
00:13:41,181 --> 00:13:43,748
Shall we move on to spousal
support and maintenance?

387
00:13:43,749 --> 00:13:45,016
Uh, yes,

388
00:13:45,017 --> 00:13:47,151
but, uh, it's almost noon.

389
00:13:47,152 --> 00:13:50,021
Why don't we pick up after lunch.

390
00:13:53,725 --> 00:13:55,960
That concession was damaging.

391
00:13:55,961 --> 00:13:57,561
We can't afford any more giveaways.

392
00:13:57,562 --> 00:13:59,230
David, she's
a woman in love--

393
00:13:59,231 --> 00:14:00,798
it's gonna be hard to motivate her.

394
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:03,233
- Do you need dirt?
DAVID: Yes.

395
00:14:03,234 --> 00:14:04,702
But that's the challenge
about prenups-- you need

396
00:14:04,703 --> 00:14:06,837
to throw enough dirt
on the spouse to get something,

397
00:14:06,838 --> 00:14:08,706
but not too much to kill the wedding.

398
00:14:08,707 --> 00:14:10,107
I'll be delicate.

399
00:14:11,108 --> 00:14:12,409
LYMAN:
<i>Lyman Nordquist.</i>

400
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:15,312
I am the CEO of LOC Pharmaceuticals.

401
00:14:15,413 --> 00:14:17,447
Is <i>that</i> loud enough?

402
00:14:17,448 --> 00:14:19,007
It is. Thank you
for speaking up.

403
00:14:19,008 --> 00:14:22,318
So you funded Mr. Canning's trust,
Encinal Equity,

404
00:14:22,819 --> 00:14:26,489
- The one that purchased all of our firm's
debt. Is that correct? - Yes it is.

405
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:27,357
Now, help me out here.

406
00:14:27,358 --> 00:14:29,392
Why would a billion dollar conglomerate

407
00:14:29,393 --> 00:14:31,461
want to control the debt
of a Chicago law firm?

408
00:14:31,462 --> 00:14:33,429
I renew my objection to
this witness, Your Honor.

409
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:35,998
A creditor's motive is not
relevant; Only his debt is.

410
00:14:35,999 --> 00:14:38,034
Mr. Canning is the one
who brought up motive,

411
00:14:38,035 --> 00:14:39,402
Your Honor, by suggesting this debt

412
00:14:39,403 --> 00:14:41,404
was for afflicted children.

413
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:47,910
JUDGE: Are-are you
all right, Mr. Canning?

414
00:14:53,014 --> 00:14:54,682
I am now, sir, yes.

415
00:14:54,683 --> 00:14:58,152
Mr. Gardner, you're arguing
that the creditor

416
00:14:58,153 --> 00:15:01,187
has a biased motive
for resisting your extension?

417
00:15:01,188 --> 00:15:02,222
Yes, clearly.

418
00:15:02,223 --> 00:15:03,858
JUDGE: Well, then,
unfortunately, Mr. Canning,

419
00:15:03,859 --> 00:15:06,527
- I have to overrule you.
- So, Mr. Nordquist,

420
00:15:06,528 --> 00:15:08,962
why fund the purchase of our debt?

421
00:15:11,231 --> 00:15:12,499
JUDGE:
Mr. Nordquist,

422
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,801
I must compel you to answer.

423
00:15:14,802 --> 00:15:16,536
(Sighs heavily)

424
00:15:16,537 --> 00:15:19,940
Lockhart/Gardner brings costly
nuisance suits against us.

425
00:15:19,941 --> 00:15:22,375
WILL: Ah... so this <i>isn't</i>
about handicapped children.

426
00:15:22,376 --> 00:15:24,059
NORDQUIST: There is
nothing either illegal

427
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,811
- or unethical in our actions.
- But Mr. Canning

428
00:15:25,812 --> 00:15:27,845
would never support an extension
of our debt deadline,

429
00:15:27,846 --> 00:15:29,681
- even if it was one week.
CANNING: Objection.

430
00:15:29,682 --> 00:15:31,416
- Beyond the scope.
- That's all right.

431
00:15:31,417 --> 00:15:34,086
I think it's clear why Mr. Canning
doesn't want our extension.

432
00:15:34,587 --> 00:15:37,121
- What was <i>that?</i>
- What was...

433
00:15:37,122 --> 00:15:38,422
Mr. Nordquist?

434
00:15:38,423 --> 00:15:41,158
- He's the money who wants
what we both want. - "We"?

435
00:15:41,659 --> 00:15:44,094
When did we become a "we"?

436
00:15:44,095 --> 00:15:46,997
You're right; I'm
being presumptuous.

437
00:15:46,998 --> 00:15:48,665
Lockhart/Gardner is a good firm

438
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:50,934
with good people who
are being mismanaged.

439
00:15:50,935 --> 00:15:54,404
Now, if you agree with
that, then we are a "we."

440
00:15:54,405 --> 00:15:56,574
- I'm not here to destroy it.
- I know.

441
00:15:56,575 --> 00:15:58,109
You're here to make sure
the firm's creditor--

442
00:15:58,110 --> 00:15:59,875
myself-- gets paid,

443
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:01,978
and to put a good firm
on firmer footing.

444
00:16:01,979 --> 00:16:03,145
That's what I want, too.

445
00:16:03,146 --> 00:16:05,815
You intend to be a lawyer,
Mr. Hayden. Is that right?

446
00:16:05,816 --> 00:16:07,016
Yes. Why?

447
00:16:07,017 --> 00:16:08,518
Have you passed the bar?

448
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:10,453
I take it next week.

449
00:16:10,454 --> 00:16:12,088
Illinois.

450
00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:13,939
That's a tough exam.

451
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,774
Struggled with that one myself.

452
00:16:15,775 --> 00:16:17,909
What do you intend to do afterward?

453
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:20,779
Practice the law. Why?

454
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:23,081
We should talk.

455
00:16:27,332 --> 00:16:28,783
You're kidding.

456
00:16:28,785 --> 00:16:30,000
(Laughs)

457
00:16:30,002 --> 00:16:31,952
Congratulations.

458
00:16:31,954 --> 00:16:33,370
Thank you.

459
00:16:33,372 --> 00:16:36,824
(Sighs) I'm... stunned.
I wasn't expecting it.

460
00:16:36,826 --> 00:16:38,459
I was; just not so soon.

461
00:16:38,461 --> 00:16:40,344
This is one for the history books.

462
00:16:40,346 --> 00:16:42,179
Fourth year.

463
00:16:42,181 --> 00:16:44,348
How much is the catch?

464
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:47,852
Well, the capital
contribution is $600,000.

465
00:16:47,854 --> 00:16:49,220
- Wow.
- Yeah.

466
00:16:49,222 --> 00:16:51,105
But I can borrow against the mortgage.

467
00:16:51,107 --> 00:16:52,440
I just need you to cosign.

468
00:16:52,942 --> 00:16:55,059
Why cosign?
I'll loan it to you.

469
00:16:55,061 --> 00:16:57,010
You...

470
00:16:57,012 --> 00:16:59,814
No, Peter, I haven't even
decided if I'm gonna do it.

471
00:16:59,816 --> 00:17:01,198
Why wouldn't you?

472
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,567
Well... the firm,
its situation.

473
00:17:03,569 --> 00:17:06,070
I think I want to see
where things fall.

474
00:17:06,072 --> 00:17:07,488
Okay. Well, that's smart,

475
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:10,741
but when you decide,
I'm fronting you the money.

476
00:17:10,743 --> 00:17:12,893
It's a business decision, Alicia.

477
00:17:12,895 --> 00:17:15,529
It's like taking out stock,
nothing else.

478
00:17:16,331 --> 00:17:20,551
Thank you.
That means a lot to me.

479
00:17:20,553 --> 00:17:22,002
Hey, Alicia.

480
00:17:22,004 --> 00:17:23,637
Hi.

481
00:17:23,639 --> 00:17:26,307
- I'm Jordan.
- I know.

482
00:17:26,309 --> 00:17:28,392
You walk fast.
I'm in a hurry.

483
00:17:28,394 --> 00:17:30,561
Just need a minute
with the God question.

484
00:17:30,563 --> 00:17:32,897
- The God question?
- Uh, the question of belief.

485
00:17:32,899 --> 00:17:34,348
What do you believe?

486
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:36,650
Uh, I believe your father
was politely Anglican

487
00:17:36,652 --> 00:17:39,353
and your mother was politely nothing.

488
00:17:39,355 --> 00:17:41,155
Am I being too personal?

489
00:17:41,157 --> 00:17:42,823
- You're being something.
- We're making an issue

490
00:17:42,825 --> 00:17:44,825
of Maddie Hayward's religious beliefs,

491
00:17:44,827 --> 00:17:47,077
which means she's gonna
make an issue of yours.

492
00:17:47,079 --> 00:17:48,779
And how is she gonna do that?

493
00:17:48,781 --> 00:17:50,748
At the Leadership Forum tomorrow,

494
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:54,335
we have a surrogate who'll
hit her with the atheism thing,

495
00:17:54,337 --> 00:17:57,087
so you may be asked, too.

496
00:17:57,089 --> 00:17:59,540
So, if you don't mind,
what do you believe?

497
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:02,710
(Chuckling)

498
00:18:02,712 --> 00:18:04,411
(Chuckles)

499
00:18:04,413 --> 00:18:06,764
Okay. We'll talk later.

500
00:18:07,566 --> 00:18:10,100
Go ahead, Cary.
You're the one who discovered it.

501
00:18:10,102 --> 00:18:11,936
Uh, actually, Kalinda did.

502
00:18:11,938 --> 00:18:14,021
Actually, I don't care.
Someone tell them.

503
00:18:14,523 --> 00:18:16,223
CARY:
The shares of Chumhum

504
00:18:16,225 --> 00:18:18,893
that Neil Gross offered
you in the prenup,

505
00:18:18,895 --> 00:18:20,311
they'll be worthless if you divorce.

506
00:18:20,313 --> 00:18:22,763
- Why? What do you mean?
KALINDA: The prenup has

507
00:18:22,765 --> 00:18:24,615
- no non-dilution clause.
DAVID: Meaning that if

508
00:18:24,617 --> 00:18:25,816
the shares aren't fixed

509
00:18:25,818 --> 00:18:27,535
at a percentage of the company's value,

510
00:18:27,537 --> 00:18:30,321
Neil can keep issuing
more stocks and more stocks,

511
00:18:30,323 --> 00:18:32,040
and poof, millions become pennies.

512
00:18:32,042 --> 00:18:34,909
- I don't care.
- Deena, I think you should listen.

513
00:18:34,911 --> 00:18:36,043
No, Dad.

514
00:18:36,045 --> 00:18:37,545
Neil and I had lunch.

515
00:18:37,547 --> 00:18:39,296
We're ready to put
this stuff behind us.

516
00:18:39,298 --> 00:18:42,633
- In my professional opinion...
- I have made my decision.

517
00:18:42,635 --> 00:18:44,552
I won't let money guide me.

518
00:18:44,554 --> 00:18:46,503
Please shut it
down, Mr. Lee.

519
00:18:46,505 --> 00:18:48,389
Thank you.

520
00:18:51,793 --> 00:18:53,460
We're not shutting anything down.

521
00:18:53,462 --> 00:18:55,896
She just needs a good dose of reality.

522
00:18:55,898 --> 00:18:58,265
She said she won't let money guide her.

523
00:18:58,267 --> 00:18:59,133
Yeah.

524
00:18:59,635 --> 00:19:01,852
So don't go after money.

525
00:19:02,704 --> 00:19:04,154
Okay.

526
00:19:04,156 --> 00:19:05,639
Good.

527
00:19:06,141 --> 00:19:07,942
We'll make sure Gross and his lawyers

528
00:19:07,944 --> 00:19:09,994
give her a good dose of reality.

529
00:19:09,996 --> 00:19:12,413
- Gross and his lawyers?
- Live and learn,

530
00:19:12,415 --> 00:19:14,832
young protégé, live and learn.

531
00:19:16,834 --> 00:19:18,485
CANNING:
Ms. Lockhart,

532
00:19:18,487 --> 00:19:20,620
the $30 million you raised,

533
00:19:20,622 --> 00:19:22,122
does that include the firm's take

534
00:19:22,124 --> 00:19:24,041
on the 16 cases you settled?

535
00:19:24,043 --> 00:19:25,793
Yes. In the previous ten years,

536
00:19:25,795 --> 00:19:26,927
what percentage of litigation

537
00:19:26,929 --> 00:19:28,846
did you settle
rather than bring to verdict?

538
00:19:28,848 --> 00:19:30,848
Objection. Only the firm's
conduct since bankruptcy

539
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:32,666
- is relevant here.
- Overruled.

540
00:19:32,668 --> 00:19:33,717
Ms. Lockhart?

541
00:19:34,719 --> 00:19:36,387
- I wouldn't know offhand.
- I would.

542
00:19:36,389 --> 00:19:37,504
Less than 30%.

543
00:19:37,506 --> 00:19:39,139
Yet, since the firm
declared bankruptcy,

544
00:19:39,141 --> 00:19:40,557
it's settled 100% of its cases.

545
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:41,775
Objection!
Attorney is testifying.

546
00:19:41,777 --> 00:19:42,893
Here's some testifying;
They're reducing

547
00:19:42,895 --> 00:19:44,311
the debt on the backs of their clients.

548
00:19:44,313 --> 00:19:45,679
- Your Honor...
- It's immoral. It's unethical.

549
00:19:45,681 --> 00:19:47,482
Excuse me, Your Honor.
Mr. Canning has not...

550
00:19:47,484 --> 00:19:48,983
(All arguing at once)

551
00:19:48,985 --> 00:19:50,451
If he wants a war, he's got one.

552
00:19:50,453 --> 00:19:52,653
- Diane...
- No. We're not gonna let a mercenary

553
00:19:52,655 --> 00:19:53,905
like Canning get away with smearing

554
00:19:53,907 --> 00:19:55,022
our reputation like that!

555
00:19:55,024 --> 00:19:57,592
The thing is,
we may have exposure here.

556
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,794
Will...

557
00:20:00,296 --> 00:20:02,362
we have never sold out a client.

558
00:20:02,364 --> 00:20:03,047
Never once.

559
00:20:03,049 --> 00:20:04,966
I agree.
But if he has evidence

560
00:20:04,968 --> 00:20:07,168
- contradicting your testimony...
- What evidence?

561
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:08,920
The Spence West Nile case.

562
00:20:08,922 --> 00:20:11,589
We wanted $15 million;
We dropped our ask to 12.

563
00:20:11,591 --> 00:20:12,890
For a very good reason.

564
00:20:12,892 --> 00:20:14,041
- We needed the money.
- No.

565
00:20:14,043 --> 00:20:15,209
That was a good settlement.

566
00:20:15,211 --> 00:20:16,511
And if he puts someone

567
00:20:16,513 --> 00:20:18,062
on the stand who contradicts us?

568
00:20:18,064 --> 00:20:19,614
Someone who will tell the truth,

569
00:20:19,616 --> 00:20:21,649
- even if it hurts?
- Who?

570
00:20:23,151 --> 00:20:24,152
KALINDA:
Alicia.

571
00:20:24,654 --> 00:20:25,486
Yes?

572
00:20:25,488 --> 00:20:27,054
You've been subpoenaed.

573
00:20:35,643 --> 00:20:37,093
We give up.

574
00:20:37,643 --> 00:20:39,393
Really?

575
00:20:39,395 --> 00:20:40,479
That's a first.

576
00:20:40,481 --> 00:20:42,781
My client is amenable
to Mr. Gross's positions

577
00:20:42,782 --> 00:20:44,816
- on all financial issues.
- Great.

578
00:20:44,818 --> 00:20:46,067
We should do this more often

579
00:20:46,069 --> 00:20:47,802
with the clients out of the room.

580
00:20:47,804 --> 00:20:49,988
My office will prepare the paperwork,

581
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:51,323
and we'll get it to you, yes?

582
00:20:51,325 --> 00:20:52,424
Actually, there is just one thing.

583
00:20:52,426 --> 00:20:53,792
I thought it was too easy.

584
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:55,410
Ms. Lampard would like
the document to address

585
00:20:55,412 --> 00:20:57,695
a number of personal
cohabitation expectations.

586
00:20:57,697 --> 00:20:59,414
Within reason, we'll listen.
What are they?

587
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:00,882
ALICIA:
Relationship maintenance.

588
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:03,668
Ms. Lampard requests
a date night each week,

589
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:05,503
preferably on Fridays,

590
00:21:05,505 --> 00:21:08,039
to last no less than
four hours door to door.

591
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:09,307
- Consecutive hours?
- Yes.

592
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:11,976
And also Mr. Gross is required
to spend 600 minutes

593
00:21:12,478 --> 00:21:14,579
- away from work each week.
- Inclusive of the date?

594
00:21:14,581 --> 00:21:16,281
No. In addition.

595
00:21:16,283 --> 00:21:18,149
- That could be problematic.
- We're open to negotiation.

596
00:21:18,451 --> 00:21:19,517
CARY:
Children.

597
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:20,802
Ms. Lampard insists

598
00:21:20,804 --> 00:21:22,687
that any children
will be brought up Christian.

599
00:21:22,689 --> 00:21:23,821
No, deal breaker.

600
00:21:23,823 --> 00:21:24,989
Mr. Gross is Jewish.

601
00:21:24,991 --> 00:21:26,107
Oh, come on.

602
00:21:26,109 --> 00:21:27,992
We made movement on the money.

603
00:21:27,994 --> 00:21:30,028
Can't give on religion.
What else are you after?

604
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:31,246
Sexual maintenance.

605
00:21:31,778 --> 00:21:33,198
Number of times a week?

606
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,365
- Yes.
- Mm-hmm.

607
00:21:34,867 --> 00:21:37,418
We can horse-trade on that.

608
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:39,070
Good.

609
00:21:39,072 --> 00:21:40,955
- I thought we were shutting this down.
DAVID: We were.

610
00:21:40,957 --> 00:21:42,924
We tried. They asked for
some additional items.

611
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:45,376
Cary, why don't you?

612
00:21:45,378 --> 00:21:47,212
(Sighs)

613
00:21:47,214 --> 00:21:48,846
Mr. Gross wants you
to stipulate

614
00:21:48,848 --> 00:21:50,715
that your children
will be raised Jewish.

615
00:21:50,717 --> 00:21:52,550
- What?
DAVID: Yes.

616
00:21:52,552 --> 00:21:53,768
We were surprised.

617
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:56,521
DEENA: We never
discussed religion.

618
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:57,705
Not once.

619
00:21:57,707 --> 00:21:58,890
His lawyers also insisted

620
00:21:58,892 --> 00:22:01,226
on a few relationship bullet points.

621
00:22:01,228 --> 00:22:03,528
Sexual maintenance.

622
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,596
At least twice a week,

623
00:22:05,598 --> 00:22:08,366
though Mr. Gross reserves
the sole discretion for more

624
00:22:08,368 --> 00:22:09,767
or less.

625
00:22:09,769 --> 00:22:12,070
- He asked for that?
- His lawyers did.

626
00:22:12,072 --> 00:22:13,821
Look, when you said stand down,

627
00:22:13,823 --> 00:22:15,790
his lawyers pressed their advantage.

628
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:17,792
That's the problem with standing down.

629
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:19,877
CARY:
We can push back, Deena,

630
00:22:19,879 --> 00:22:22,914
or you can just sign this prenup
and hope for the best,

631
00:22:22,916 --> 00:22:25,583
but I would push back if I were you.

632
00:22:30,305 --> 00:22:31,339
Push back.

633
00:22:31,341 --> 00:22:33,841
Push back hard.

634
00:22:33,843 --> 00:22:35,793
Nicely played, Cary.

635
00:22:35,795 --> 00:22:37,145
Thank you, sir.

636
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:39,063
You're gonna make a hell
of an equity partner.

637
00:22:40,182 --> 00:22:44,102
Now, you two get moving on
Gross's asset assessment.

638
00:22:46,105 --> 00:22:47,855
They offered you partnership?

639
00:22:47,857 --> 00:22:49,941
Uh, I know, it's funny, right?

640
00:22:49,943 --> 00:22:51,492
Me, too.

641
00:22:51,494 --> 00:22:52,977
Yeah?

642
00:22:52,979 --> 00:22:54,245
I was wondering if they did.

643
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:55,913
Congratulations.

644
00:22:56,915 --> 00:22:59,033
I think they were counting
my years before I left,

645
00:22:59,035 --> 00:23:00,868
not just the last seven months.

646
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:02,920
Yeah, you're probably right.

647
00:23:02,922 --> 00:23:04,839
So...

648
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:07,008
Congratulations, partner.

649
00:23:14,832 --> 00:23:15,883
DIANE:
Alicia?

650
00:23:15,885 --> 00:23:17,053
Do you have a moment?

651
00:23:18,555 --> 00:23:20,838
Any idea why you were subpoenaed?

652
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,674
No.

653
00:23:22,676 --> 00:23:25,810
WILL: We were wondering if it
was about the West Nile case.

654
00:23:25,812 --> 00:23:27,462
Canning faced you on that.

655
00:23:28,144 --> 00:23:29,731
Maybe.

656
00:23:31,299 --> 00:23:33,117
Well, the recession has worsened

657
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:34,535
this past year.

658
00:23:34,537 --> 00:23:37,622
Even clients with good cases
have had cash flow issues.

659
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:40,024
Meaning the percentage of cases
we've settled has increased.

660
00:23:40,026 --> 00:23:41,525
Which leads to the absurd suggestion

661
00:23:41,527 --> 00:23:43,211
that we pushed our clients to settle

662
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:44,495
- so we could get paid.
- We just want

663
00:23:44,497 --> 00:23:46,080
to make sure we're all on the same page

664
00:23:46,082 --> 00:23:47,632
with our testimony.

665
00:23:49,734 --> 00:23:51,085
I think so.

666
00:23:52,887 --> 00:23:53,755
Good.

667
00:23:53,757 --> 00:23:55,590
Good. That's all.

668
00:23:55,592 --> 00:23:57,392
Oh, and did you go out
and do something special?

669
00:23:57,894 --> 00:23:59,010
Celebrate?

670
00:23:59,712 --> 00:24:01,813
Yes, I did.

671
00:24:03,232 --> 00:24:05,233
(Door opens)

672
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:06,818
(Door closes)

673
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:11,272
So, where are you on belief in God?

674
00:24:12,274 --> 00:24:13,658
(Laughs)

675
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,278
What?
For the campaign.

676
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,862
Yes, I know.

677
00:24:17,864 --> 00:24:19,280
Your friend, Jordan, already asked me.

678
00:24:19,282 --> 00:24:20,581
He was here?

679
00:24:20,583 --> 00:24:22,283
No, at the campaign bus.

680
00:24:22,285 --> 00:24:24,168
Oh. What did you say?

681
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:26,404
I said it's personal.

682
00:24:26,406 --> 00:24:28,790
For him, right?
But not for us.

683
00:24:28,792 --> 00:24:30,574
(Chuckles) Great.

684
00:24:30,576 --> 00:24:32,460
Thought so.
Do you have a minute?

685
00:24:32,462 --> 00:24:34,762
So, that's almost a belief in God.

686
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:36,631
How is that almost a belief in God?

687
00:24:36,633 --> 00:24:38,383
I have a husband who believes in God

688
00:24:38,385 --> 00:24:39,851
- and a daughter who might...
- Yes.

689
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:41,302
- And what about Zach?
- eI don't know.

690
00:24:41,304 --> 00:24:42,720
- But I don't.
- But the point is

691
00:24:42,722 --> 00:24:43,971
you could believe in God.

692
00:24:43,973 --> 00:24:45,306
But I don't.

693
00:24:45,308 --> 00:24:47,975
Yes, but if Jesus were to show
up in your office right now,

694
00:24:47,977 --> 00:24:49,444
you'd believe in him, wouldn't you?

695
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:50,761
No.

696
00:24:50,763 --> 00:24:52,447
Yes, you would-- if he
performed a miracle.

697
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:54,949
Well, if Jesus walked into my office

698
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:57,118
right now and performed
a miracle, then yes,

699
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,036
- I would believe in God.
- Good. See?

700
00:24:59,038 --> 00:25:00,121
You're a seeker.

701
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:01,122
(Chuckles)

702
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:03,541
Alicia, I know this sounds stupid,

703
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:05,743
but voters hate atheists.

704
00:25:05,745 --> 00:25:07,795
They think they spend
all their time fighting mangers

705
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:09,464
outside city hall.

706
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:10,998
They want people
who are open-minded,

707
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,633
and you are open-minded.

708
00:25:12,635 --> 00:25:15,803
Okay, is that what you want me to say?

709
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:17,004
I want you

710
00:25:17,006 --> 00:25:18,506
to be Saint Alicia.

711
00:25:18,508 --> 00:25:20,441
It's a selling point for Peter,

712
00:25:20,443 --> 00:25:22,176
and voters don't want to think
Saint Alicia's an atheist.

713
00:25:22,878 --> 00:25:24,462
Okay.

714
00:25:25,164 --> 00:25:28,566
So Diane and Will negotiated
in good faith,

715
00:25:28,568 --> 00:25:30,568
Cary is as deserving as I am,

716
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:33,020
and God might exist.

717
00:25:34,022 --> 00:25:35,306
I'm good.

718
00:25:35,308 --> 00:25:37,492
Yeah, I don't know
what that was about, but...

719
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:39,694
yes!

720
00:25:41,196 --> 00:25:43,281
Jordan...

721
00:25:43,983 --> 00:25:45,316
What did you think of him?

722
00:25:45,318 --> 00:25:47,034
He's...

723
00:25:47,736 --> 00:25:48,836
awkward.

724
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:50,621
He is, isn't he?

725
00:25:50,623 --> 00:25:52,924
Not a bad thing to mention to Peter.

726
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:53,875
Okay.

727
00:25:53,877 --> 00:25:55,376
Just one scripted line per day, please.

728
00:25:55,378 --> 00:25:57,545
Right, okay.
I'm out of here.

729
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:01,883
- Oh, my God.
DAVID: Well, if he's not going to do it,

730
00:26:01,885 --> 00:26:04,001
at least memorialize his intent!

731
00:26:04,003 --> 00:26:05,770
He's not memorializing anything.

732
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:07,171
CARY: Except outrageous
personal demands.

733
00:26:07,173 --> 00:26:09,340
ROCHELLE: David, this is not
an IPO; it's a prenup.

734
00:26:09,342 --> 00:26:10,858
DAVID: What, do you
think I'm an idiot?

735
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,276
Of course it's not.

736
00:26:12,278 --> 00:26:14,278
MR. LAMPARD: The point is my
daughter is entitled to protection.

737
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,446
You shouldn't even be in the room.

738
00:26:15,448 --> 00:26:17,148
Please do not talk
to my client's father.

739
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:18,783
My God, this is so silly!

740
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:22,119
(Sighs) Deena, I'm not gonna
dilute your stock options.

741
00:26:22,121 --> 00:26:25,072
And when did you start worrying
about stock options?

742
00:26:25,074 --> 00:26:26,157
Wait a minute, when did you?

743
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:27,658
I'm talking to my fiancée.

744
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:31,028
Look, this is contract language,
baby, that's all.

745
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:32,163
It's about precedent.

746
00:26:32,165 --> 00:26:33,364
If I give you more,

747
00:26:33,366 --> 00:26:36,200
then every future contract
will ask for more.

748
00:26:36,202 --> 00:26:39,053
You mean every future prenup
after you divorce me.

749
00:26:39,055 --> 00:26:41,872
You know what, that's it.

750
00:26:41,874 --> 00:26:43,424
- We're done.
- That's fine, Neil.

751
00:26:43,426 --> 00:26:44,759
You never loved me.

752
00:26:44,761 --> 00:26:47,228
All you wanted me to do was
spread my legs twice a week

753
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:48,429
and breed your children.

754
00:26:48,431 --> 00:26:49,814
Okay, okay,

755
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:51,098
everybody sit down.

756
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:53,267
Would you go after her?

757
00:26:53,269 --> 00:26:55,553
The point is you love him.

758
00:26:55,555 --> 00:26:56,771
Don't you love him?

759
00:26:56,773 --> 00:26:59,357
But everything he's done--
the stock options...

760
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:01,442
But you said you don't
care about the money.

761
00:27:01,444 --> 00:27:03,411
I don't; he does.
That's the point.

762
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:05,913
It's not what I care about;
It's what he cares about.

763
00:27:08,833 --> 00:27:10,067
You know what I think, Deena?

764
00:27:10,069 --> 00:27:11,786
- I think you should go to him.
- No.

765
00:27:11,788 --> 00:27:14,405
Yes. Just call him,

766
00:27:14,407 --> 00:27:15,923
say you want to have dinner,

767
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:17,458
no lawyers in the room.

768
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:21,095
All of this was moving too fast.

769
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:22,680
The more Neil spends time with you,

770
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:24,715
the less he'll care about the
money, I promise you that.

771
00:27:24,717 --> 00:27:26,717
And we're the ones who
are pushing the money.

772
00:27:30,755 --> 00:27:31,806
CARY:
You two,

773
00:27:31,808 --> 00:27:34,025
you need to pull each other past it.

774
00:27:39,615 --> 00:27:42,683
(Bottle pops open, pills rattling)

775
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:46,904
Hello, Mrs. Florrick.

776
00:27:47,406 --> 00:27:48,789
Hello, Mr. Canning.

777
00:27:49,291 --> 00:27:50,441
We recently faced each other

778
00:27:50,443 --> 00:27:52,910
in a case involving
the West Nile virus, didn't we?

779
00:27:52,912 --> 00:27:55,079
We did. Good to
see you again.

780
00:27:55,081 --> 00:27:56,247
And you.

781
00:27:56,249 --> 00:27:57,915
Seems we all made it back okay.

782
00:27:58,834 --> 00:28:00,668
My client settled that, didn't he?

783
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:02,286
He did.

784
00:28:02,288 --> 00:28:03,754
$12 million.

785
00:28:03,756 --> 00:28:06,807
And to your knowledge,
was the decision by your firm

786
00:28:06,809 --> 00:28:08,476
to settle that case driven at all

787
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:10,261
by its need to raise capital?

788
00:28:10,263 --> 00:28:12,630
It was driven by our client's desire

789
00:28:12,632 --> 00:28:14,231
to avoid protracted litigation.

790
00:28:14,233 --> 00:28:16,133
So that would be a no?

791
00:28:16,135 --> 00:28:18,152
That would be a categorical no.

792
00:28:18,154 --> 00:28:19,353
A categorical no?

793
00:28:19,355 --> 00:28:21,606
That's...
that's a really big no.

794
00:28:21,608 --> 00:28:22,973
The biggest.

795
00:28:22,975 --> 00:28:24,992
And to your knowledge, has
your firm ever settled any case

796
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:26,861
in the past five months
with the reduction of its debt

797
00:28:26,863 --> 00:28:28,079
as a consideration?

798
00:28:28,781 --> 00:28:29,696
No.

799
00:28:29,698 --> 00:28:30,331
Mrs. Florrick,

800
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:31,649
did you meet with Mr. Gardner

801
00:28:31,651 --> 00:28:32,750
and Miss Lockhart in preparation

802
00:28:32,752 --> 00:28:34,368
- for your testimony here today?
- Objection.

803
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:35,419
I'll allow.

804
00:28:35,421 --> 00:28:36,654
Yes,

805
00:28:36,656 --> 00:28:38,656
but only to discuss my responsibility

806
00:28:38,658 --> 00:28:40,174
to answer your questions truthfully.

807
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:41,992
Mrs. Florrick,
are you aware of any schemes

808
00:28:41,994 --> 00:28:44,045
perpetrated by your firm
to reduce its debt?

809
00:28:44,047 --> 00:28:45,296
Objection as to vagueness.

810
00:28:45,298 --> 00:28:46,631
I'm quite certain
Mrs. Florrick knows

811
00:28:46,633 --> 00:28:47,848
what "scheme" means.

812
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:48,766
I'll allow.

813
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:50,468
I'm aware of no such scheme.

814
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:52,353
You were recently offered a partnership

815
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:54,355
at Lockhart/Gardner, is that right?

816
00:28:54,997 --> 00:28:56,107
Yes.

817
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:57,274
And how much will that cost you?

818
00:28:57,276 --> 00:28:59,143
Objection: relevance.

819
00:28:59,145 --> 00:29:00,144
Overruled.

820
00:29:00,146 --> 00:29:02,146
My buy-in
to the firm

821
00:29:02,148 --> 00:29:03,948
is $600,000.

822
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,566
You're a fourth-year associate,
is that right?

823
00:29:05,568 --> 00:29:06,784
Correct.

824
00:29:06,786 --> 00:29:08,202
Does it seem odd to you

825
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:09,870
that a fourth-year associate
should be offered a partnership?

826
00:29:11,172 --> 00:29:12,323
Yes.

827
00:29:12,325 --> 00:29:13,708
And isn't it odder still

828
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:15,409
that five associates
at Lockhart/Gardner,

829
00:29:15,411 --> 00:29:18,412
all fourth-year associates,
should be offered partnerships?

830
00:29:20,716 --> 00:29:22,833
Oh, I'm sorry.
You weren't aware.

831
00:29:22,835 --> 00:29:25,086
Five associates at Lockhart/Gardner

832
00:29:25,088 --> 00:29:26,837
were offered partnerships.

833
00:29:26,839 --> 00:29:28,422
Is that your question?

834
00:29:28,424 --> 00:29:29,674
Did I know that?

835
00:29:29,676 --> 00:29:30,925
For a start, sure.

836
00:29:32,393 --> 00:29:34,094
No, I did not know that.

837
00:29:34,196 --> 00:29:35,262
And were you aware that your firm

838
00:29:35,264 --> 00:29:37,548
is trying to raise millions
of dollars to pay off its debt

839
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:38,549
by naming five partners?

840
00:29:38,551 --> 00:29:40,067
Objection:
Asked and answered.

841
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:41,986
JUDGE:
Sustained.

842
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:43,771
There's no scheme, Mr. Canning.

843
00:29:44,273 --> 00:29:46,157
Unless you consider
the promotion of someone

844
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:49,410
who has billed thousands of hours

845
00:29:49,912 --> 00:29:53,497
and helped win dozens of cases
a scheme.

846
00:29:53,499 --> 00:29:55,199
I have nothing further.

847
00:29:55,201 --> 00:29:57,334
JUDGE:
Mr. Gardner?

848
00:29:57,836 --> 00:29:59,003
Witness may step down.

849
00:30:24,908 --> 00:30:27,376
(Indistinct chatter)

850
00:30:29,095 --> 00:30:30,946
ELI:
Alicia, there you are.

851
00:30:31,448 --> 00:30:32,965
You look fantastic.

852
00:30:32,967 --> 00:30:34,917
Thanks.

853
00:30:36,002 --> 00:30:37,252
You okay?

854
00:30:37,454 --> 00:30:38,404
Is everything...?

855
00:30:38,406 --> 00:30:40,422
Good, yeah, great.

856
00:30:40,424 --> 00:30:42,141
Just let me know when you want me

857
00:30:42,143 --> 00:30:43,642
to say I believe in God, Eli.

858
00:30:43,644 --> 00:30:45,010
Uh, okay,

859
00:30:45,012 --> 00:30:46,962
I don't think that's quite
the way to handle this.

860
00:30:46,964 --> 00:30:50,766
Alicia, I think we
should become friends.

861
00:30:50,768 --> 00:30:51,817
Why?

862
00:30:51,819 --> 00:30:53,302
Political wives tend to like me.

863
00:30:53,304 --> 00:30:54,820
I keep them in the loop.

864
00:30:54,822 --> 00:30:56,137
Do you believe in God?

865
00:30:56,139 --> 00:30:57,138
Do I believe in God?

866
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:58,323
I don't...
I don't know. Why?

867
00:30:58,325 --> 00:31:00,242
That seems to be the question du jour.

868
00:31:00,244 --> 00:31:03,278
I believe in rainbows
and little kids' smiles.

869
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,663
That help?

870
00:31:04,665 --> 00:31:05,981
Hi, Maddie.

871
00:31:05,983 --> 00:31:07,533
Alicia, it's been a long time.

872
00:31:07,535 --> 00:31:09,585
Yep.

873
00:31:10,087 --> 00:31:12,287
You have any new friends?

874
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:15,824
Just so you know, Alicia,

875
00:31:15,826 --> 00:31:17,209
I didn't break off our friendship,

876
00:31:17,211 --> 00:31:19,327
and if you could let go
of this victimhood pose

877
00:31:19,329 --> 00:31:20,462
that you're hanging on to...

878
00:31:20,464 --> 00:31:22,381
You know what you
can do with your vic...

879
00:31:22,383 --> 00:31:24,216
Hey, there you are.

880
00:31:24,218 --> 00:31:26,268
Hello, Peter.
How are you?

881
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:27,436
Good.

882
00:31:27,438 --> 00:31:28,887
Looking like one debate, I see.

883
00:31:28,889 --> 00:31:30,672
Looks like it.

884
00:31:30,674 --> 00:31:32,524
Everything okay here?

885
00:31:32,526 --> 00:31:33,892
Just grand, darling.

886
00:31:33,894 --> 00:31:36,528
You know, I would love to get
you in the bathroom and...

887
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:38,480
WOMAN:
Mr. State's Attorney, hello.

888
00:31:38,482 --> 00:31:40,365
Any reservations about
sharing the spotlight

889
00:31:40,367 --> 00:31:42,201
with Miss Hayward in
another campaign event?

890
00:31:42,203 --> 00:31:43,852
None at all.

891
00:31:43,854 --> 00:31:45,954
And by the way,
this is not a campaign event.

892
00:31:45,956 --> 00:31:47,873
I'm here to honor the 20th anniversary

893
00:31:47,875 --> 00:31:49,074
of the leadership forum.

894
00:31:49,076 --> 00:31:50,542
It's a campaign event.

895
00:31:50,544 --> 00:31:52,628
Miss Hayward, how do you respond

896
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:54,296
to the controversy over your actions

897
00:31:54,298 --> 00:31:55,881
at last week's benediction?

898
00:31:55,883 --> 00:31:57,416
My actions?

899
00:31:57,418 --> 00:32:00,886
You mean the video on the Web
of me not bowing?

900
00:32:00,888 --> 00:32:01,920
Yes, during prayer.

901
00:32:01,922 --> 00:32:03,038
There's been some chatter

902
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,372
about your insensitivity.

903
00:32:04,374 --> 00:32:06,975
Well, I apologize
if it seemed insensitive.

904
00:32:06,977 --> 00:32:09,177
I was just trying
to avoid being hypocritical.

905
00:32:09,179 --> 00:32:10,762
I am an atheist.

906
00:32:10,764 --> 00:32:12,264
Really?

907
00:32:12,266 --> 00:32:14,049
Don't you worry
about how that will play

908
00:32:14,051 --> 00:32:16,935
in a state where only 15%
call themselves nonreligious?

909
00:32:16,937 --> 00:32:20,388
I worry about everything,
um, but I am who I am,

910
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:22,441
and I don't think you
should run away from that.

911
00:32:22,443 --> 00:32:24,026
Let's just let the voters decide.

912
00:32:24,028 --> 00:32:26,278
And what about you,
Mr. State's Attorney?

913
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,330
I respect Maddie's point of view.

914
00:32:28,332 --> 00:32:30,082
But you don't share it?

915
00:32:30,084 --> 00:32:31,416
Well, it's different.

916
00:32:31,418 --> 00:32:32,618
I was in prison.

917
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:33,919
Belief means a great deal there.

918
00:32:33,921 --> 00:32:36,371
In fact, sometimes it was
the only thing we had.

919
00:32:36,373 --> 00:32:37,789
And your wife?

920
00:32:37,791 --> 00:32:40,241
Oh, well, I...

921
00:32:40,243 --> 00:32:43,595
I think my wife can speak for herself.

922
00:32:43,597 --> 00:32:46,014
I'm an atheist.

923
00:32:50,219 --> 00:32:54,273
Nothing in Chumhum's
2011 10-K, either.

924
00:32:54,275 --> 00:32:56,591
Check the footnotes.

925
00:32:56,593 --> 00:32:59,978
Accountants, they hide problems
in their footnotes.

926
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:01,446
Footnotes.

927
00:33:01,448 --> 00:33:05,484
I heard that you were
offered partnership.

928
00:33:05,486 --> 00:33:07,069
Yeah.

929
00:33:07,071 --> 00:33:09,905
Me, Alicia and three others.

930
00:33:09,907 --> 00:33:11,990
Well, congratulations.

931
00:33:11,992 --> 00:33:13,375
What?

932
00:33:13,377 --> 00:33:15,460
They need the money.

933
00:33:15,462 --> 00:33:18,046
They're just handing out
partnerships like Popsicles.

934
00:33:18,048 --> 00:33:19,715
Popsicles?

935
00:33:19,717 --> 00:33:21,717
I don't know; it's late.

936
00:33:21,719 --> 00:33:23,785
So, you going to take it?

937
00:33:23,787 --> 00:33:26,254
The Popsicle?

938
00:33:26,256 --> 00:33:28,256
If I can get the draw together, sure.

939
00:33:28,258 --> 00:33:31,059
Oh, you just feel sorry for yourself

940
00:33:31,061 --> 00:33:33,011
because you were offered something.

941
00:33:36,816 --> 00:33:38,600
- Hey.
- What?

942
00:33:39,819 --> 00:33:41,636
Check out the 2010 expenditures.

943
00:33:41,638 --> 00:33:44,156
The footnote,
under "miscellaneous," there.

944
00:33:44,158 --> 00:33:47,659
You see the off-balance-sheet
joint venture for $112,000?

945
00:33:47,661 --> 00:33:49,310
Yeah.

946
00:33:50,496 --> 00:33:52,547
It's in the 2009 10-K, too.

947
00:33:52,549 --> 00:33:55,334
Well, there's your dirt.

948
00:33:55,336 --> 00:33:57,502
I'll tell David Lee.

949
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:58,987
(Elevator bell dings)

950
00:34:04,177 --> 00:34:05,427
Mr. Hayden?

951
00:34:06,429 --> 00:34:07,662
Cary.

952
00:34:07,664 --> 00:34:09,514
May I help you?

953
00:34:09,516 --> 00:34:12,267
No, uh... (Sighs)

954
00:34:12,269 --> 00:34:13,268
I don't know.

955
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:16,905
No, I... I...
(Sighs quietly)

956
00:34:17,907 --> 00:34:18,940
No.

957
00:34:18,942 --> 00:34:19,891
(Laughs)

958
00:34:19,893 --> 00:34:21,193
Are you sure?

959
00:34:22,695 --> 00:34:26,114
I don't like mess;
I like precision.

960
00:34:26,116 --> 00:34:27,449
I know.

961
00:34:27,451 --> 00:34:30,351
This is mess, and I'm not sure
how to handle it.

962
00:34:30,353 --> 00:34:32,371
What is... what is mess?

963
00:34:32,373 --> 00:34:37,626
This, this... business
with Louis Canning.

964
00:34:40,747 --> 00:34:42,297
Oh, well.

965
00:34:42,299 --> 00:34:45,300
Hey, you have the bar exam
this week, don't you?

966
00:34:45,302 --> 00:34:46,885
Yes, I do.

967
00:34:46,887 --> 00:34:48,303
Good luck.
(Laughs)

968
00:34:48,305 --> 00:34:50,889
Thank you.

969
00:34:50,891 --> 00:34:53,392
But I don't know,
I've come to not like the law.

970
00:34:53,994 --> 00:34:56,011
It's not very precise.

971
00:34:56,013 --> 00:34:59,181
(Elevator bell dings) It can be; it just
depends on the way you practice it.

972
00:35:02,018 --> 00:35:04,820
(Sighs)

973
00:35:04,822 --> 00:35:05,904
You're right.

974
00:35:05,906 --> 00:35:07,939
It can be.

975
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:11,693
Mr. Hayden...

976
00:35:12,695 --> 00:35:14,062
I'm sorry.

977
00:35:14,564 --> 00:35:16,081
About before, testifying the way I did,

978
00:35:16,083 --> 00:35:17,833
against you, in that bankruptcy
mediation, I just...

979
00:35:17,835 --> 00:35:21,086
Why? It was the truth.

980
00:35:31,431 --> 00:35:34,133
I've been subpoenaed in court.

981
00:35:34,135 --> 00:35:36,418
DAVID: I appreciate that
we're all back at the table.

982
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:37,720
Mazel tov.

983
00:35:37,722 --> 00:35:38,771
But I'm not sure what the point is,

984
00:35:38,773 --> 00:35:40,222
if he's not willing to negotiate.

985
00:35:40,224 --> 00:35:43,342
Maybe you could ease up on some
of your demands. (Laughing)

986
00:35:43,344 --> 00:35:45,144
Mmm. Deena, Mr. Lampard,

987
00:35:45,146 --> 00:35:47,146
would you mind stepping out a moment?

988
00:35:47,148 --> 00:35:48,480
- Why?
- Believe me, sir,

989
00:35:48,482 --> 00:35:49,565
it's in your daughter's best interest.

990
00:35:49,567 --> 00:35:50,599
DEENA:
I don't mind.

991
00:35:50,601 --> 00:35:52,368
Don't get lonely.

992
00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:54,153
I won't.

993
00:35:58,541 --> 00:36:00,376
Okay, what have you got?

994
00:36:00,378 --> 00:36:02,277
I was reviewing Chumhum's SEC filings,

995
00:36:02,279 --> 00:36:04,797
and there's a recurring
joint venture expense,

996
00:36:04,799 --> 00:36:08,133
hidden in a footnote, for $112,000.

997
00:36:08,135 --> 00:36:10,452
I take exception
to the adjective "hidden."

998
00:36:10,454 --> 00:36:12,671
(Laughing): A valuation
challenge for 100 grand?

999
00:36:12,673 --> 00:36:14,122
David, seriously.

1000
00:36:14,124 --> 00:36:15,341
The joint venture

1001
00:36:15,343 --> 00:36:17,793
is a Rhode Island LLC
called JC Partners.

1002
00:36:17,795 --> 00:36:21,063
And its one beneficiary
is Jacob Carlisle.

1003
00:36:22,065 --> 00:36:24,366
That's the four-year-old
son of Dara Carlisle,

1004
00:36:24,368 --> 00:36:26,819
the woman that Mr. Gross
had a one-night stand with,

1005
00:36:26,821 --> 00:36:29,855
in Greensboro in 2008
at a shareholders' meeting.

1006
00:36:32,141 --> 00:36:34,410
ROCHELLE: So what's the threat?
Cough up the money,

1007
00:36:34,412 --> 00:36:35,778
or you'll tell your client?

1008
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:37,496
We don't know.
We thought we'd discuss it.

1009
00:36:37,498 --> 00:36:39,832
- Extortion? Not even you would sink
that low. - Sure I would.

1010
00:36:40,534 --> 00:36:41,817
I'm going to call
the State's Attorney's Office.

1011
00:36:41,819 --> 00:36:43,151
You're going to forfeit your license.

1012
00:36:43,153 --> 00:36:44,152
NEIL:
Rochelle, just stop.

1013
00:36:44,154 --> 00:36:45,671
Neil, no.

1014
00:36:45,673 --> 00:36:47,289
- That's... this...
- I'll give...

1015
00:36:48,658 --> 00:36:50,292
Give them what they want.

1016
00:36:56,766 --> 00:36:58,183
DAVID:
Isn't that sweet?

1017
00:36:59,185 --> 00:37:01,252
Young love.

1018
00:37:09,755 --> 00:37:10,855
CANNING:
So, Mr. Hayden...

1019
00:37:11,357 --> 00:37:13,558
you probably had
the best available view

1020
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,792
of all the shenanigans
at Lockhart/Gardner...

1021
00:37:14,794 --> 00:37:15,793
Objection.

1022
00:37:15,795 --> 00:37:17,012
- As to shenanigans...
- I'll rephrase.

1023
00:37:17,014 --> 00:37:18,346
You had the best view

1024
00:37:18,348 --> 00:37:19,981
of all the goings-on
at Lockhart/Gardner?

1025
00:37:19,983 --> 00:37:22,183
Well... I was the trustee.

1026
00:37:22,185 --> 00:37:23,652
Were you aware of the decision

1027
00:37:23,654 --> 00:37:25,353
to offer partnerships
to five associates?

1028
00:37:25,355 --> 00:37:26,855
Yes.

1029
00:37:26,857 --> 00:37:29,474
And were you in agreement
with that business decision?

1030
00:37:31,944 --> 00:37:33,812
CANNING:
Mr. Hayden?

1031
00:37:35,498 --> 00:37:36,481
I was not.

1032
00:37:36,483 --> 00:37:38,733
Financial commitments to partners

1033
00:37:38,735 --> 00:37:40,151
are one of the causes

1034
00:37:40,153 --> 00:37:41,586
of the firm's bankruptcy.

1035
00:37:41,588 --> 00:37:43,288
Minting new partners is not a solution.

1036
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:45,090
They were doing it to raise money.

1037
00:37:45,092 --> 00:37:46,257
- Objection.
JUDGE: Sustained.

1038
00:37:46,259 --> 00:37:47,626
CANNING:
Let me try it this way:

1039
00:37:47,628 --> 00:37:49,044
If each of those new partners met

1040
00:37:49,046 --> 00:37:50,679
their capital contribution obligation,

1041
00:37:50,681 --> 00:37:52,163
how much money would
Lockhart/Gardner raise?

1042
00:37:52,165 --> 00:37:53,481
$3 million.

1043
00:37:53,483 --> 00:37:55,166
So, if allocated towards
repayment of the debt,

1044
00:37:55,168 --> 00:37:58,803
it would give the illusion
of financial progress, right?

1045
00:37:58,805 --> 00:37:59,971
CLARKE:
Yes.

1046
00:37:59,973 --> 00:38:01,640
CANNING: So the large
number of offers can only

1047
00:38:01,642 --> 00:38:03,391
be explained as a...
as a pyramid scheme.

1048
00:38:03,393 --> 00:38:04,976
Wait, no, no, strike that.

1049
00:38:04,978 --> 00:38:07,028
In this context,
how would you characterize

1050
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:10,482
the offer of employment
in exchange for money?

1051
00:38:10,484 --> 00:38:14,336
Your description, while crude, is apt.

1052
00:38:14,338 --> 00:38:16,488
It's a type of pyramid scheme.

1053
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:17,789
And isn't a job being dangled

1054
00:38:17,791 --> 00:38:21,910
in this quid pro quo
sort of way... extraordinary?

1055
00:38:21,912 --> 00:38:22,961
No, I'm afraid not.

1056
00:38:22,963 --> 00:38:25,130
It's not?
Why is it not?

1057
00:38:25,132 --> 00:38:26,498
Well...

1058
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:29,501
just the other day, you offered
me employment in exchange...

1059
00:38:29,503 --> 00:38:31,469
- Let's move on.
- Objection.

1060
00:38:31,471 --> 00:38:32,420
Let the witness answer.

1061
00:38:32,422 --> 00:38:33,555
The answer is irrelevant.

1062
00:38:33,557 --> 00:38:35,006
The answer was incomplete.

1063
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:37,142
When it is complete, the judge
can decide if it's relevant.

1064
00:38:37,144 --> 00:38:39,344
Ms. Lockhart,
please let me do my job.

1065
00:38:39,346 --> 00:38:42,847
Go ahead and complete
your answer, Mr. Hayden.

1066
00:38:42,849 --> 00:38:44,516
I was saying, just the other day,

1067
00:38:44,518 --> 00:38:46,234
you offered me employment,
Mr. Canning,

1068
00:38:46,236 --> 00:38:49,604
in exchange for continued help
in these proceedings.

1069
00:38:49,606 --> 00:38:51,856
Move to strike as nonresponsive.

1070
00:38:51,858 --> 00:38:52,941
Overruled.

1071
00:38:52,943 --> 00:38:54,576
I think it was perfectly responsive.

1072
00:38:54,578 --> 00:38:57,612
CANNING: Under oath,
sir, did I ever make

1073
00:38:57,614 --> 00:38:59,063
an offer of employment to you,

1074
00:38:59,065 --> 00:39:00,832
contingent upon your assistance
in this hearing?

1075
00:39:00,834 --> 00:39:02,283
No, but the clear import was that...

1076
00:39:02,285 --> 00:39:03,868
No further questions.

1077
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:07,706
What, exactly,
did Mr. Canning offer you?

1078
00:39:07,708 --> 00:39:10,291
He intimated there would be
a job for me at his law firm

1079
00:39:10,293 --> 00:39:11,459
when these proceedings were over.

1080
00:39:11,461 --> 00:39:13,595
And, uh, just prior to that intimation,

1081
00:39:13,597 --> 00:39:16,715
did he ask you for assistance
in this matter?

1082
00:39:16,717 --> 00:39:18,082
Yes.

1083
00:39:18,084 --> 00:39:20,935
He requested detailed
information about cases.

1084
00:39:26,142 --> 00:39:28,092
Thank you, Mr. Hayden.

1085
00:39:28,094 --> 00:39:30,261
You're welcome.

1086
00:39:31,096 --> 00:39:32,864
WILL:
Five-month extension.

1087
00:39:32,866 --> 00:39:34,115
That gives us breathing room.

1088
00:39:34,117 --> 00:39:35,950
DAVID: And Mrs. Gross is
thinking about assigning us

1089
00:39:35,952 --> 00:39:38,620
her entire Midwest book of business.

1090
00:39:38,622 --> 00:39:40,622
The tide is turning.

1091
00:39:40,624 --> 00:39:44,325
The vultures from Real Estate
are hoovering up all the shrimp.

1092
00:39:44,327 --> 00:39:46,244
Mr. Gardner, Ms. Lockhart.

1093
00:39:46,246 --> 00:39:47,829
Mr. Hayden.

1094
00:39:47,831 --> 00:39:50,415
We don't know what to say...
except thank you.

1095
00:39:50,417 --> 00:39:52,950
Though I confess I don't
understand your motivation.

1096
00:39:52,952 --> 00:39:55,787
Well, I don't agree with
how your run your business,

1097
00:39:55,789 --> 00:39:59,224
but you paid me the compliment
of not assuming I was for sale.

1098
00:39:59,226 --> 00:40:01,476
Good luck with the bar next week.

1099
00:40:01,478 --> 00:40:03,478
Thank you.

1100
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:06,231
It has been interesting here.

1101
00:40:06,233 --> 00:40:10,468
I don't know if I'll miss it,
but I'll...

1102
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,438
No, I won't miss it.

1103
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,658
CANNING: And they ate and
drank and made merry.

1104
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:18,276
All save poor little Cinderella,

1105
00:40:18,278 --> 00:40:20,028
who toiled amidst the reverie.

1106
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:21,446
Mr. Canning,

1107
00:40:21,448 --> 00:40:23,782
I thought you'd be off
somewhere, licking your wounds.

1108
00:40:23,784 --> 00:40:24,833
(Chuckles)

1109
00:40:24,835 --> 00:40:27,669
I'm a quick healer.

1110
00:40:27,671 --> 00:40:30,255
No, I just came by to
sign the extension.

1111
00:40:30,257 --> 00:40:33,541
Mr. Canning, you're not here
to sign any extension.

1112
00:40:34,844 --> 00:40:36,961
You know what the best thing
about Monopoly is?

1113
00:40:36,963 --> 00:40:38,797
The "Get Out of Jail Free" card.

1114
00:40:38,799 --> 00:40:40,164
I used to love hoarding that card

1115
00:40:40,166 --> 00:40:42,166
'cause you never knew
when you might need it.

1116
00:40:42,168 --> 00:40:43,134
Mr. Canning, please.

1117
00:40:43,136 --> 00:40:44,335
I hate these stories.

1118
00:40:44,337 --> 00:40:46,521
Whatever it is you need
to say, just say it.

1119
00:40:46,523 --> 00:40:47,856
I don't need the story.

1120
00:40:51,026 --> 00:40:53,061
This...

1121
00:40:53,063 --> 00:40:55,446
is your "Get Out of Jail Free" card.

1122
00:41:04,323 --> 00:41:05,740
DIANE:
What did he want?

1123
00:41:06,742 --> 00:41:08,743
Mr. Canning?

1124
00:41:08,745 --> 00:41:10,411
It was a personal matter.
Nothing important.

1125
00:41:10,413 --> 00:41:12,497
Well, I'm here on a professional one.

1126
00:41:12,499 --> 00:41:14,749
Your absence from the festivities

1127
00:41:14,751 --> 00:41:18,253
is sending quite a message
to the partnership.

1128
00:41:18,255 --> 00:41:20,922
Uh, what message would that be?

1129
00:41:20,924 --> 00:41:23,842
That you're not vested
in our little enterprise.

1130
00:41:24,927 --> 00:41:26,010
(Laughs)

1131
00:41:26,012 --> 00:41:27,211
You're pouting.

1132
00:41:27,213 --> 00:41:28,329
It's unbecoming.

1133
00:41:28,331 --> 00:41:29,330
No.

1134
00:41:29,332 --> 00:41:31,215
I'm working.

1135
00:41:32,050 --> 00:41:34,218
You know why I was made partner?

1136
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:38,106
Jonas Stern was sued
for sexual harassment,

1137
00:41:38,108 --> 00:41:40,859
and he needed to show
that he had a female partner.

1138
00:41:42,361 --> 00:41:43,827
That's all.

1139
00:41:43,829 --> 00:41:45,496
When the door that you
have been knocking at

1140
00:41:45,498 --> 00:41:46,664
finally swings open,

1141
00:41:46,666 --> 00:41:50,001
you don't ask why;
You run through.

1142
00:41:50,003 --> 00:41:52,069
That is the simple fact.

1143
00:41:52,071 --> 00:41:54,839
No one is here to make it
comfortable for you;

1144
00:41:54,841 --> 00:41:56,925
No one is here to appreciate
your moping,

1145
00:41:56,927 --> 00:41:59,677
so this is my advice to you:

1146
00:41:59,679 --> 00:42:01,446
Take a minute for yourself,

1147
00:42:01,448 --> 00:42:03,548
put on your best gracious voice,

1148
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:05,466
find a way to wear a smile,

1149
00:42:05,468 --> 00:42:07,352
and then come into the conference room

1150
00:42:07,354 --> 00:42:09,187
ready to thank the equity partners

1151
00:42:09,189 --> 00:42:12,140
for giving you this opportunity.

1152
00:42:12,142 --> 00:42:16,110
Because what is given can
quickly be taken away.

1153
00:42:38,633 --> 00:42:39,467
Thank you, Will.

1154
00:42:39,469 --> 00:42:41,219
Thank you, David, for giving me

1155
00:42:41,221 --> 00:42:43,004
this great opportunity
to become a partner.

1156
00:42:43,006 --> 00:42:44,121
I won't disappoint you.

1157
00:42:44,123 --> 00:42:45,556
We know you won't.
You're welcome.

1158
00:42:45,558 --> 00:42:47,258
DAVID:
Just you remember one thing:

1159
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:49,978
It's all about client maintenance.

1160
00:42:54,849 --> 00:42:57,485
Thank you, Diane, for thinking
of me for this position.

1161
00:42:57,487 --> 00:42:58,903
I won't disappoint you.

1162
00:42:58,905 --> 00:42:59,938
Good.

1163
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:01,189
Well, you haven't in the past,

1164
00:43:01,191 --> 00:43:03,307
and we know you won't in the future.

1165
00:43:09,447 --> 00:43:11,983
ALICIA: I just want to say thank you so
much for this opportunity. Thank you.

1166
00:43:11,985 --> 00:43:13,835
I will not disappoint you.

1167
00:43:13,837 --> 00:43:15,620
- I know you won't.
- Thank you.

1168
00:43:16,622 --> 00:43:18,372
ALICIA: I'm very much
looking forward to it.

1169
00:43:18,374 --> 00:43:20,507
- What a wonderful, wonderful thing.
- Congratulations.

1170
00:43:20,509 --> 00:43:22,659
Thank you, again, so much.
