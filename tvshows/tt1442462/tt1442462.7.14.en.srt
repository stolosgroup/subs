00:00:10,532 --> 00:00:12,958
DIANE: <i>Welcome to Lockhart, Agos & Lee.</i>

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,961
<i>As you probably know, we
are an all-service law firm</i>

4
00:00:15,963 --> 00:00:18,129
<i>with a rich tradition.</i>

5
00:00:18,475 --> 00:00:20,259
<i>The firm was formed 12 years ago</i>

6
00:00:20,289 --> 00:00:22,345
<i>by Jonas Stern and myself,</i>

7
00:00:22,375 --> 00:00:24,002
<i>Diane Lockhart.</i>

8
00:00:24,004 --> 00:00:26,445
<i>Last year, the firm reconstituted itself</i>

9
00:00:26,475 --> 00:00:29,808
<i>with Cary Agos and David
Lee as name partners.</i>

10
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:32,952
<i>We occupy two floors in
the Dryden Building...</i>

11
00:00:32,982 --> 00:00:35,965
<i>the executive suite on the 28th floor</i>

12
00:00:35,967 --> 00:00:38,650
<i>and the 27th floor, where support staff</i>

13
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:41,081
<i>and most associates work.</i>

14
00:00:41,111 --> 00:00:43,736
<i>As a new associate, you
will be given a card key</i>

15
00:00:43,766 --> 00:00:45,854
<i>for your assigned floor,</i>

16
00:00:45,884 --> 00:00:48,690
<i>and you will be provided
an employee handbook.</i>

17
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,179
<i>Due to severe overcrowding,</i>

18
00:00:50,181 --> 00:00:52,581
<i>not all of you will receive an office.</i>

19
00:00:53,006 --> 00:00:56,211
<i>Some of you may have to work
from cubicles for the moment.</i>

20
00:00:56,241 --> 00:00:57,498
<i>Lastly,</i>

21
00:00:57,528 --> 00:01:01,690
Lockhart, Agos & Lee is a true meritocracy.

22
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,719
One of our name partners
came from where you sit now

23
00:01:04,749 --> 00:01:06,361
in a mere six years.

24
00:01:06,363 --> 00:01:10,070
It can be done, and we
expect no less of you.

25
00:01:10,972 --> 00:01:12,935
So give yourself a hand.

26
00:01:12,937 --> 00:01:15,537
(Applause)

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

28
00:01:24,274 --> 00:01:25,274
(Ding)

29
00:01:26,854 --> 00:01:28,917
Well, look at you, big-time lawyer.

30
00:01:28,919 --> 00:01:31,175
Well, look at you, coming back home.

31
00:01:31,205 --> 00:01:33,808
Yep. Not much has changed.

32
00:01:33,838 --> 00:01:35,258
Did we make a mistake?

33
00:01:35,288 --> 00:01:37,619
I don't know. We'll see.

34
00:01:37,649 --> 00:01:39,049
CARY: Hey, Alicia.

35
00:01:39,771 --> 00:01:42,402
God. This is really weird.

36
00:01:42,432 --> 00:01:44,833
I know, but not bad weird, is it?

37
00:01:44,835 --> 00:01:47,435
- Not yet.
- Well,

38
00:01:47,437 --> 00:01:49,565
first things first,
there's no room on the 28th.

39
00:01:49,595 --> 00:01:51,278
- I know.
- There might be soon.

40
00:01:51,308 --> 00:01:53,897
But you will have the
biggest office on the 27th.

41
00:01:53,927 --> 00:01:55,944
Hey, it's where I started out.

42
00:01:55,974 --> 00:01:57,500
It's where we started out.

43
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:00,431
And I'm on the 27th,
too. So we can pass notes.

44
00:02:03,167 --> 00:02:04,903
- Aw, that's nice.
- (Phone chimes)

45
00:02:04,905 --> 00:02:07,003
Eh, something from the partners.

46
00:02:07,033 --> 00:02:08,495
I have to get back upstairs,

47
00:02:08,525 --> 00:02:11,296
but drop by and we'll catch a bite.

48
00:02:11,326 --> 00:02:13,499
- It's great to have you back.
- Thanks.

49
00:02:13,529 --> 00:02:16,151
Oh, Lucca, I have to introduce
you at some point to Monica.

50
00:02:16,181 --> 00:02:17,782
Oh, we've already met.

51
00:02:17,784 --> 00:02:19,572
CARY: Oh-oh, right,
yeah. On the other, um,

52
00:02:19,602 --> 00:02:22,754
Chumhum case. Well, you'll love her.

53
00:02:24,213 --> 00:02:25,374
Shall we drink that now?

54
00:02:25,404 --> 00:02:26,925
(Chuckles)

55
00:02:26,927 --> 00:02:28,578
Oh.

56
00:02:28,608 --> 00:02:29,644
Yeah,

57
00:02:29,646 --> 00:02:30,946
I'd hire you.

58
00:02:30,948 --> 00:02:32,916
HOWELL: Alicia, I think I need to hire you.

59
00:02:32,946 --> 00:02:35,318
Do you remember me? I'm Howell.

60
00:02:35,348 --> 00:02:36,518
(Click)

61
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,674
Uh, yes, hello.

62
00:02:38,704 --> 00:02:40,176
Um, this is Lucca Quinn.

63
00:02:40,206 --> 00:02:43,204
Howell is the firm's technology director.

64
00:02:43,234 --> 00:02:45,132
I-I don't think I know your last name.

65
00:02:45,162 --> 00:02:46,495
Just Howell.

66
00:02:46,497 --> 00:02:48,063
Anyway, I have something

67
00:02:48,065 --> 00:02:49,831
seriously incredible to show you.

68
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:51,833
So, last night my girlfriend Amy and I go

69
00:02:51,835 --> 00:02:53,486
to the closing night of Deviceroy.

70
00:02:53,516 --> 00:02:55,437
- Device what?
- Deviceroy.

71
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:56,775
It's the consumer electronics show.

72
00:02:56,805 --> 00:02:59,634
Like the big CES one in Vegas

73
00:02:59,664 --> 00:03:03,033
but without the hookers
or Cirque du Soleil. So,

74
00:03:03,063 --> 00:03:06,398
monster after-party, 15,000 people.

75
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,266
End of the night, Amy
finds something on the floor

76
00:03:08,268 --> 00:03:11,169
under a table. So she gives it to me.

77
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:14,147
I wake up this morning. Ooh.

78
00:03:14,177 --> 00:03:16,208
- I realize what it is.
- ALICIA: What what is?

79
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:19,311
HOWELL: The Foil. The new
Chumhum tablet. Their big

80
00:03:19,313 --> 00:03:21,741
contribution to the gadget
market. Comes out in two months.

81
00:03:21,771 --> 00:03:23,748
I don't understand.
Someone just left it there?

82
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,990
Yeah. So I tweeted a picture of it.

83
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:28,186
Next thing I know, two different
tech blogs are calling me

84
00:03:28,188 --> 00:03:30,230
so they can be the first to review it.

85
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:32,356
Gadgy's offering me 100 grand.

86
00:03:32,386 --> 00:03:33,792
$100,000?

87
00:03:34,471 --> 00:03:37,762
Scoops like this are like the
<i>Pentagon Papers</i> to these sites.

88
00:03:37,764 --> 00:03:40,132
They want an answer in
an hour. So I need to know

89
00:03:40,134 --> 00:03:43,335
if I can sell it and if
you'll negotiate it for me.

90
00:03:43,869 --> 00:03:46,048
- I, uh...
- Yeah. Sure.

91
00:03:46,078 --> 00:03:48,273
- $100,000?
- Lucca, uh,

92
00:03:48,275 --> 00:03:50,041
let's just take a minute on this, okay?

93
00:03:50,043 --> 00:03:52,210
Just give us a minute.

94
00:03:55,033 --> 00:03:56,583
This could be sticky.

95
00:03:57,076 --> 00:04:00,452
One Selfie. Mango,
carrot, ginger, kale, mint,

96
00:04:00,454 --> 00:04:02,187
- apple, bee pollen.
- Thank you.

97
00:04:02,189 --> 00:04:03,855
That's going to be
disgusting, just so you know.

98
00:04:03,857 --> 00:04:07,385
- What is a Selfie?
- It's a make-your-own.

99
00:04:07,415 --> 00:04:08,860
You're supposed to take a picture with it

100
00:04:08,862 --> 00:04:10,694
and post it online.

101
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:12,484
I know, right?

102
00:04:13,118 --> 00:04:15,767
Um, and what is an "Arlen-ergy"?

103
00:04:15,769 --> 00:04:17,469
It's pronounced "Arlenergy."

104
00:04:17,471 --> 00:04:20,521
Like "energy" but with an
"Arlene" in front of it.

105
00:04:21,213 --> 00:04:23,737
- (Chuckles)
- It's named after our owner.

106
00:04:23,767 --> 00:04:25,243
Juices are the new vanity plates.

107
00:04:25,245 --> 00:04:27,145
Well, what do you recommend?

108
00:04:27,662 --> 00:04:28,999
The juice bar down the street.

109
00:04:29,029 --> 00:04:30,909
- It's half the price.
- Mmm. (Chuckles)

110
00:04:30,939 --> 00:04:32,217
Or a NutMegan.

111
00:04:32,219 --> 00:04:35,307
I'll take the "Arlene-ergy."

112
00:04:35,337 --> 00:04:37,222
'Cause I'm a sucker for advertising.

113
00:04:37,224 --> 00:04:39,025
Is that why you bought
that shirt, advertising?

114
00:04:39,055 --> 00:04:41,744
- You don't like my shirt?
- Actually, I do.

115
00:04:41,774 --> 00:04:44,797
But very few girls would say that.

116
00:04:45,749 --> 00:04:46,897
Hey.

117
00:04:46,927 --> 00:04:47,927
Um...

118
00:04:49,509 --> 00:04:51,007
do you get a lunch break?

119
00:04:51,982 --> 00:04:54,891
It's not Europe, so I only get an hour.

120
00:04:55,475 --> 00:04:57,175
(Whirring)

121
00:04:57,958 --> 00:04:59,644
So good to have you back.

122
00:04:59,646 --> 00:05:00,879
Thank you.

123
00:05:00,881 --> 00:05:02,503
Home is where they take you in, right?

124
00:05:02,533 --> 00:05:03,520
Happily take you in.

125
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:05,367
- Um, and you know Lucca.
- Yes.

126
00:05:05,369 --> 00:05:08,066
Early this morning. I have
to introduce you to Monica.

127
00:05:08,096 --> 00:05:09,237
I think you'll like each other.

128
00:05:09,239 --> 00:05:10,872
We were across the table from each other,

129
00:05:10,874 --> 00:05:12,574
on the Chummy Maps case.

130
00:05:13,008 --> 00:05:14,634
Oh. Right.

131
00:05:14,664 --> 00:05:17,749
So, uh, you haven't even sat
down yet and you have something?

132
00:05:17,779 --> 00:05:20,035
Yes. Howell.

133
00:05:20,065 --> 00:05:21,121
Our I.T. guy.

134
00:05:21,151 --> 00:05:23,273
Right. Uh, Cary briefed me.

135
00:05:23,303 --> 00:05:26,871
How is this tablet not
considered stolen property?

136
00:05:26,873 --> 00:05:29,021
It was abandoned. It's
more accurately defined

137
00:05:29,051 --> 00:05:30,393
as lost property.

138
00:05:30,423 --> 00:05:32,243
Uh, by law, Howell has

139
00:05:32,245 --> 00:05:34,469
to give the owner a chance to recover.

140
00:05:34,499 --> 00:05:36,341
He has to at least attempt

141
00:05:36,371 --> 00:05:38,583
- constructive notice.
- Not by law.

142
00:05:39,931 --> 00:05:41,953
Lucca, can you give us a minute?

143
00:05:49,251 --> 00:05:50,261
(Door shuts)

144
00:05:50,263 --> 00:05:52,130
- We can't be a part of this.
- She's right

145
00:05:52,132 --> 00:05:54,605
on the law. And how it's enforced.

146
00:05:54,635 --> 00:05:57,650
We can't risk a lawsuit from
Chumhum over a casual favor

147
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,730
- to an employee.
- (Knocking)

148
00:06:02,693 --> 00:06:05,377
LUCCA: Just to confirm,
this call is being recorded

149
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:08,213
- for quality and training purposes?
- MAN: Yes, it is, ma'am.

150
00:06:08,215 --> 00:06:10,315
- How may I help you?
- DIANE: What is this?

151
00:06:10,345 --> 00:06:12,373
- Chumhum Customer Service.
- How may I help you?

152
00:06:12,403 --> 00:06:14,468
Hi. Uh, I have in my possession

153
00:06:14,498 --> 00:06:17,281
a prototype of the new Foil tablet.

154
00:06:17,311 --> 00:06:20,225
- I'm sorry... Excuse me?
- The Foil tablet.

155
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:22,394
- I have it.
- That's not possible, ma'am.

156
00:06:22,396 --> 00:06:25,196
- It is, because I have it.
- The Foil will be released

157
00:06:25,198 --> 00:06:26,731
in time for back-to-school sales.

158
00:06:26,733 --> 00:06:28,388
Would you like me to
give you the Web address?

159
00:06:28,418 --> 00:06:31,014
No. Uh, could I speak to a supervisor?

160
00:06:31,044 --> 00:06:32,287
I am a supervisor.

161
00:06:32,289 --> 00:06:35,123
Ah. So you have authority
to answer my questions?

162
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:36,993
- That's correct.
- Then could you advise me

163
00:06:37,023 --> 00:06:39,366
on the best way to return
the tablet to the company?

164
00:06:39,396 --> 00:06:40,418
It's not the Foil, ma'am.

165
00:06:40,448 --> 00:06:42,797
The Foil will be released in
time for back-to-school sales.

166
00:06:42,799 --> 00:06:45,504
- So I can keep it?
- Whatever you have, you can keep.

167
00:06:45,534 --> 00:06:47,641
Shall I direct you to the Web site?

168
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,233
Constructive notice given

169
00:06:51,263 --> 00:06:53,036
- and rejected.
- Howell is now firmly in

170
00:06:53,066 --> 00:06:56,924
the "finders keepers" territory,
and we can help him sell it.

171
00:06:59,311 --> 00:07:01,361
Why don't you give us a minute.

172
00:07:03,325 --> 00:07:04,819
So this is bureaucracy.

173
00:07:04,821 --> 00:07:05,921
(Door shuts)

174
00:07:07,324 --> 00:07:09,157
The Israeli Army? Really?

175
00:07:09,159 --> 00:07:11,593
Yeah. But it's not like I shot anyone.

176
00:07:11,595 --> 00:07:14,262
One time I did this great
thing along the Egyptian border.

177
00:07:14,264 --> 00:07:17,299
They have these five-women
sharpshooter teams

178
00:07:17,301 --> 00:07:19,101
camouflaged in the desert.

179
00:07:19,487 --> 00:07:21,236
You stay all night in a pod

180
00:07:21,238 --> 00:07:24,049
about the size of these two tables.

181
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:25,994
Five women, all night,

182
00:07:26,024 --> 00:07:27,742
and all you can do is whisper.

183
00:07:27,744 --> 00:07:29,952
It's really terrifying but really cool.

184
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:31,107
Did you see any terrorists?

185
00:07:31,137 --> 00:07:34,816
No. Bedouin nomads, mostly.

186
00:07:35,442 --> 00:07:40,466
Now I'm here in this stupid
juice bar 3,000 miles away.

187
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:41,990
It's 11:00 p.m. in Israel

188
00:07:41,992 --> 00:07:45,493
and my friends are slipping
into their desert pods right now

189
00:07:45,495 --> 00:07:48,697
and I'm... here talking to you.

190
00:07:49,527 --> 00:07:50,675
Weird.

191
00:07:50,705 --> 00:07:52,022
Yeah.

192
00:07:52,052 --> 00:07:55,204
Were your parents afraid
of you being over there?

193
00:07:55,234 --> 00:07:57,685
Of getting stabbed, no.

194
00:07:57,715 --> 00:08:00,028
- Of turning Orthodox, yes.
- (Chuckles)

195
00:08:00,058 --> 00:08:02,544
Actually, just my mom
was. She's the worrywart.

196
00:08:02,546 --> 00:08:05,359
My dad was too busy to notice I was gone.

197
00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:07,181
Mmm. Why?

198
00:08:07,183 --> 00:08:08,717
What does he do?

199
00:08:08,747 --> 00:08:10,518
You know Governor Peter Florrick?

200
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,754
- Sure.
- He's his chief of staff.

201
00:08:12,756 --> 00:08:14,332
- (Coughs)
- Or... was.

202
00:08:14,362 --> 00:08:15,893
Then wasn't.

203
00:08:15,923 --> 00:08:18,459
Now is again, I think. (Chuckles)

204
00:08:18,891 --> 00:08:20,613
- Hmm.
- I know.

205
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:23,030
He also ran Peter's campaign for president.

206
00:08:23,032 --> 00:08:24,066
So he must have every

207
00:08:24,096 --> 00:08:26,507
rich person in Illinois
knocking down his door.

208
00:08:26,537 --> 00:08:28,594
Eh. He's a dork.

209
00:08:29,044 --> 00:08:30,938
Although I was Alicia Florrick's

210
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:33,368
body woman for her campaign
for state's attorney,

211
00:08:33,398 --> 00:08:35,359
- which he also ran.
- And Alicia Florrick?

212
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:38,146
What was it like working for her?

213
00:08:42,606 --> 00:08:44,584
You are a curious one, aren't you?

214
00:08:44,614 --> 00:08:47,866
No. I just... I don't meet
too many, you know, like,

215
00:08:47,896 --> 00:08:50,617
Malcolm Gladwell connector types.

216
00:08:50,647 --> 00:08:53,127
So, tell me about you. What do you do?

217
00:08:53,129 --> 00:08:55,591
I'm a student. Nothing exciting.

218
00:08:55,621 --> 00:08:58,414
Nothing like dealing
with a lot of campaign money.

219
00:08:58,444 --> 00:09:01,335
Yeah, I know. What do you study?

220
00:09:01,365 --> 00:09:03,084
Computers. Programming.

221
00:09:03,114 --> 00:09:06,396
- Really? Tell me more.
- (Chuckles)

222
00:09:06,426 --> 00:09:08,670
- Dad.
- I'm busy, Marissa.

223
00:09:09,207 --> 00:09:11,948
- A young man asked me to lunch today.
- Congratulations.

224
00:09:11,978 --> 00:09:13,793
Let me know when I have
to spring for a wedding.

225
00:09:13,823 --> 00:09:15,109
His name was Scott Devereaux,

226
00:09:15,139 --> 00:09:17,117
and he had a lot of questions about you.

227
00:09:17,147 --> 00:09:18,866
- I don't know him.
- Questions like

228
00:09:18,896 --> 00:09:22,962
who you have dinner with, who
gives money to the campaign,

229
00:09:22,992 --> 00:09:25,726
how often you talk with Alicia.

230
00:09:26,455 --> 00:09:27,303
What is this again?

231
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,697
A young man took me to lunch
but had much more interest

232
00:09:29,699 --> 00:09:30,991
in you than in me.

233
00:09:31,021 --> 00:09:33,367
- He said he was a student.
- What's he look like?

234
00:09:33,691 --> 00:09:36,660
Oddly enough, I convinced
him to take a selfie.

235
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:39,373
I trained you well.

236
00:09:40,493 --> 00:09:43,344
Oh, my God. He's an FBI agent.

237
00:09:43,346 --> 00:09:45,913
- What's his name?
- Scott Devereaux.

238
00:09:46,387 --> 00:09:48,027
No, no, no.

239
00:09:48,057 --> 00:09:49,656
Hlavin.

240
00:09:49,686 --> 00:09:51,214
Roland Hlavin. What did he ask?

241
00:09:51,244 --> 00:09:52,808
Did he mention a judge? Schakowsky?

242
00:09:52,838 --> 00:09:54,555
No. Why?

243
00:10:04,381 --> 00:10:06,281
What did he ask?

244
00:10:07,836 --> 00:10:10,104
...Malcolm Gladwell connector types.

245
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:12,215
So, tell me about you. What do you do?

246
00:10:12,245 --> 00:10:13,670
- You recorded it.
- I'm a student.

247
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,280
- I did.
- Nothing exciting.

248
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:18,899
Nothing like dealing with
a lot of campaign money.

249
00:10:18,929 --> 00:10:20,475
- Yeah, I know...
- What?

250
00:10:20,505 --> 00:10:23,284
It's just... Now I get
why people have children.

251
00:10:23,603 --> 00:10:27,021
They can admire themselves in someone else.

252
00:10:32,062 --> 00:10:33,329
Hi.

253
00:10:33,359 --> 00:10:35,062
Ma'am.

254
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:37,398
How do you like my office?

255
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,354
It's got a view.

256
00:10:39,384 --> 00:10:41,164
What do you think?

257
00:10:41,194 --> 00:10:43,245
Look at my chair.

258
00:10:46,176 --> 00:10:47,875
(Clang)

259
00:10:47,877 --> 00:10:50,070
I like it. It fits you.

260
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,412
Off-center?

261
00:10:51,414 --> 00:10:53,608
- Tilted.
- (Chuckles)

262
00:10:55,111 --> 00:10:57,190
How do you keep your beard that length?

263
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:59,187
I mean, at a certain point,
you're either clean-shaven

264
00:10:59,189 --> 00:11:01,058
- or you're Abraham Lincoln, right?
- No.

265
00:11:01,088 --> 00:11:03,995
It stays like this. Since birth.

266
00:11:04,237 --> 00:11:06,360
(Click)

267
00:11:08,599 --> 00:11:10,298
We kissed.

268
00:11:12,535 --> 00:11:14,101
I know.

269
00:11:14,289 --> 00:11:16,298
So what do we do now?

270
00:11:16,328 --> 00:11:19,242
I don't know. I'm not big on planning.

271
00:11:19,272 --> 00:11:21,075
Do you think it will be weird for us...

272
00:11:21,077 --> 00:11:23,042
working in a corporate setting?

273
00:11:23,072 --> 00:11:24,145
Well,

274
00:11:24,147 --> 00:11:25,255
I'm freelance.

275
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:26,814
You are.

276
00:11:27,601 --> 00:11:29,617
You're freelance.

277
00:11:35,742 --> 00:11:37,792
Okay. You know, they probably

278
00:11:37,794 --> 00:11:39,961
want me to work.

279
00:11:39,963 --> 00:11:43,072
So good seeing you, workmate.

280
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:44,665
You too.

281
00:11:50,535 --> 00:11:52,840

283
00:11:59,873 --> 00:12:01,849
Oh, come on.

284
00:12:03,575 --> 00:12:06,339
Seriously, you're dropping it?

285
00:12:06,369 --> 00:12:08,766
- It makes us nervous.
- Howell's an employee.

286
00:12:08,796 --> 00:12:10,152
He needs your help.

287
00:12:10,182 --> 00:12:12,827
Yes, but we are in a
weird place with Chumhum.

288
00:12:12,829 --> 00:12:14,225
We don't really want to poke the bear.

289
00:12:14,255 --> 00:12:16,831
Wow, things have really
changed around here.

290
00:12:20,696 --> 00:12:22,175
What's that?

291
00:12:22,983 --> 00:12:24,195
You're back home.

292
00:12:24,225 --> 00:12:26,173
It's always exciting here.

293
00:12:28,768 --> 00:12:30,708
Hello, my name's Perry Dunst.

294
00:12:30,738 --> 00:12:32,078
- I'm with the TAPS unit.
- What unit?

295
00:12:32,108 --> 00:12:34,433
We have a warrant for the
arrest of Drummond Howell.

296
00:12:34,463 --> 00:12:37,338
- On what charges?
- Trafficking in stolen property.

297
00:12:37,368 --> 00:12:39,084
That's him right there, gray sweater.

298
00:12:39,114 --> 00:12:41,188
- Go ahead and cuff him.
- DIANE: What is TAPS?

299
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:42,890
DUNST: Mr. Howell,
please get on your knees,

300
00:12:42,892 --> 00:12:44,292
put your hands behind your head.

301
00:12:44,294 --> 00:12:45,793
- What the hell's going on?
- Howell,

302
00:12:45,823 --> 00:12:47,992
don't say anything. We're Mr.
Howell's lawyers. May I see

303
00:12:48,022 --> 00:12:49,997
that warrant?

304
00:12:49,999 --> 00:12:51,638
Ma'am, please stay back.

305
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:53,520
Howell, stay calm.

306
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:55,369
We will take care of this.

307
00:12:58,217 --> 00:12:59,948
Who are those guys?

Three years?

311
00:13:19,093 --> 00:13:21,193
I didn't sell anyone this prototype.

312
00:13:21,223 --> 00:13:24,106
Did you speak to anyone besides
us about the possibility

313
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:26,385
- of selling?
- Just Amy, my girlfriend.

314
00:13:26,415 --> 00:13:27,460
You got to keep her out of this.

315
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:30,869
We will. Just remember,
whatever these agents ask,

316
00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:31,851
we do the talking.

317
00:13:31,881 --> 00:13:33,185
I thought you weren't representing me.

318
00:13:33,215 --> 00:13:36,998
We weren't. Now it's the firm.

319

Ah, it's the law firm that's

322
00:13:40,965 --> 00:13:44,106
the perpetual stone in my shoe.

323
00:13:44,108 --> 00:13:46,410
So, uh, you seem to have something of mine.

324
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,933
CARY: Sir, I think we should
handle this through lawyers.

325
00:13:47,963 --> 00:13:49,202
I've spoken to Agent Dunst,

326
00:13:49,232 --> 00:13:52,709
he's agreed to drop the
charges... lucky you... if you

327
00:13:52,739 --> 00:13:54,272
return my prototype, and if you give me

328
00:13:54,302 --> 00:13:56,064
the name of the person who gave it to you.

329
00:13:56,094 --> 00:13:57,786
Why do you need the name?

330
00:13:58,761 --> 00:14:00,285
Mrs. Florrick.

331
00:14:00,324 --> 00:14:02,358
I'm sorry about your husband's loss.

332
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,531
Thank you. Why do you need the name?

333
00:14:03,561 --> 00:14:04,938
Chumhum's suffered an unprecedented

334
00:14:04,968 --> 00:14:06,634
security breach. I need to know

335
00:14:06,664 --> 00:14:09,298
exactly what went wrong so I can make sure

336
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,593
it never happens again.

337
00:14:11,623 --> 00:14:12,990
ALICIA: <i>Howell won't
give up his girlfriend.</i>

338
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,753
Even if it means going
to jail for three years?

339
00:14:14,755 --> 00:14:16,098
Yes.

340
00:14:16,948 --> 00:14:18,324
Why are they allowing Neil Gross

341
00:14:18,326 --> 00:14:20,559
- into an interrogation room?
- ALICIA: I don't know.

342
00:14:20,561 --> 00:14:22,674
And why is he the one making the offer?

343
00:14:22,704 --> 00:14:24,230
Have you ever heard of TAPS before?

344
00:14:24,232 --> 00:14:26,132
Never.

345
00:14:28,035 --> 00:14:29,667
So what's going on here?

346
00:14:33,273 --> 00:14:34,573
Hello, Don.

347
00:14:35,408 --> 00:14:37,096
What the hell are you doing here, Eli?

348
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:38,325
I just need a minute.

349
00:14:38,355 --> 00:14:39,345
You wearing a wire?

350
00:14:39,347 --> 00:14:40,901
No. Are you?

351
00:14:40,931 --> 00:14:42,364
Why would I be?

352
00:14:42,877 --> 00:14:44,267
Is that a yes or a no?

353
00:14:44,297 --> 00:14:46,716
It's a no, Eli. I wasn't
expecting to see you

354
00:14:46,746 --> 00:14:48,872
in my chambers.

355
00:14:48,902 --> 00:14:50,296
I come bearing bad news.

356
00:14:50,326 --> 00:14:51,913
Of course you do.

357
00:14:51,943 --> 00:14:53,539
I think the FBI is investigating

358
00:14:53,569 --> 00:14:56,512
our... business last year.

359
00:14:56,899 --> 00:14:58,302
They're certainly investigating something.

360
00:14:58,332 --> 00:15:00,514
- They were here?
- Roland Hlavin.

361
00:15:00,544 --> 00:15:02,618
- That little smartass.
- What was he asking?

362
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:05,302
He was asking about Alicia Florrick.

363
00:15:05,332 --> 00:15:06,332
Alicia?

364
00:15:08,071 --> 00:15:09,091
TAPS...

365
00:15:09,093 --> 00:15:11,927
Technology Allied Protection Service.

366
00:15:11,957 --> 00:15:15,097
- What is that?
- It is a multi-agency task force

367
00:15:15,127 --> 00:15:17,199
that works with Silicon
Valley's biggest companies

368
00:15:17,201 --> 00:15:19,907
to clamp down on technology theft.

369
00:15:19,937 --> 00:15:21,042
The iPolice?

370
00:15:21,072 --> 00:15:22,738
- Yeah.
- There is such a thing?

371
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:25,474
Oh, yeah. And you want to
know something interesting?

372
00:15:25,476 --> 00:15:27,949
More interesting than the iPolice?

373
00:15:28,598 --> 00:15:31,313
Lead agent over there, Dunst. He's based

374
00:15:31,315 --> 00:15:33,382
in San Francisco. The prototype was

375
00:15:33,384 --> 00:15:36,051
reported missing at 2:30
a.m. and yet here he is,

376
00:15:36,053 --> 00:15:38,345
in Chicago, bright and early.

377
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:39,722
LUCCA: How'd he get here so fast?

378
00:15:39,724 --> 00:15:41,223
- Neil Gross' private plane.
- (Phone dings)

379
00:15:41,225 --> 00:15:43,167
That is interesting.

380
00:15:43,197 --> 00:15:45,447
Diane needs you back at the office.

381
00:15:45,579 --> 00:15:46,449
Why?

382
00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:47,563
I don't know. Go, I've got this.

383
00:15:47,565 --> 00:15:48,797
All rise

384
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:51,049
for the Honorable Judge Hal Ferris.

385
00:15:54,171 --> 00:15:56,071
Angry faces.

386
00:15:56,326 --> 00:15:57,872
Looks like fun.

387
00:15:58,807 --> 00:15:59,885
Fire away.

388
00:15:59,915 --> 00:16:00,709
Your Honor,

389
00:16:00,711 --> 00:16:03,317
my client was arrested on
the flimsiest of pretenses.

390
00:16:03,347 --> 00:16:05,004
Wait a minute.

391
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:07,085
There's a trail

392
00:16:07,115 --> 00:16:08,984
of ants here, Harris.

393
00:16:08,986 --> 00:16:11,108
Have you been eating
sandwiches on my bench again?

394
00:16:11,138 --> 00:16:11,954
No, Your Honor.

395
00:16:11,956 --> 00:16:14,583
Can we do something about this?

396
00:16:14,613 --> 00:16:16,191
I'll get right on it. Good.

397
00:16:16,193 --> 00:16:19,482
Okay, uh, I'll stand for this one.

398
00:16:19,512 --> 00:16:21,196
I'm a little grossed out.

399
00:16:21,198 --> 00:16:23,702
And I can't wait to hear more, counselor.

400
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:25,230
Yes, Your Honor.

401
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,810
We request that the U.S. Attorney show...

402
00:16:29,153 --> 00:16:29,889
Your Honor?

403
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:31,740
Yes, I can listen to you

404
00:16:31,742 --> 00:16:33,108
and watch ants

405
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:34,243
at the same time.

406
00:16:34,245 --> 00:16:35,878
We request that the AUSA

407
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,528
show probable cause or release him.

408
00:16:38,558 --> 00:16:40,883
Well, let's get to it, then.

409
00:16:40,885 --> 00:16:44,553
Mr. Gross contacted us at 2:35 a.m.

410
00:16:44,555 --> 00:16:46,509
We then interviewed Blake Reedy,

411
00:16:46,539 --> 00:16:50,801
the engineer who was
carrying the prototype.

412
00:16:50,831 --> 00:16:53,662
Mr. Reedy stated that
the device had been stolen

413
00:16:53,664 --> 00:16:57,613
from his backpack at the
Deviceroy after-party.

414
00:16:57,643 --> 00:16:58,420
We took it from there.

415
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:00,703
There were over 15,000 people at the party.

416
00:17:00,705 --> 00:17:02,137
How did you locate Mr. Howell?

417
00:17:02,139 --> 00:17:03,639
We worked the guest list,

418
00:17:03,641 --> 00:17:06,036
cross-referenced it with known offenders.

419
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:06,973
We identified

420
00:17:07,003 --> 00:17:09,131
Mr. Howell, then tracked down his tweet

421
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:10,779
with his pictures of the Foil.

422
00:17:10,781 --> 00:17:13,061
- Thanks, this is perfect.
- The Foil is the stolen tablet,

423
00:17:13,091 --> 00:17:14,377
Your Honor.

424
00:17:14,983 --> 00:17:15,983
Uh-huh.

425
00:17:16,386 --> 00:17:18,935
The known offenders list...
why was Mr. Howell on it?

426
00:17:18,965 --> 00:17:21,523
Well, he's something
of a low-level hacker.

427
00:17:21,525 --> 00:17:22,891
Low-level? I'm not low-level.

428
00:17:22,893 --> 00:17:25,900
Fanboy stuff, mostly. Unveiling new

429
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:28,364
game specs before they're released.

430
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:31,634
But he's also been suspected of hacking

431
00:17:31,664 --> 00:17:33,569
- law enforcement databases.
- Objection,

432
00:17:33,571 --> 00:17:35,337
- no foundation.
- Withdrawn.

433
00:17:35,367 --> 00:17:36,272
No more questions.

434
00:17:36,274 --> 00:17:38,722
- Okay, next.
- Um, Agent Dunst,

435
00:17:38,752 --> 00:17:40,448
you're technically with the FBI

436
00:17:40,478 --> 00:17:42,344
but also serve on TAPS...

437
00:17:42,346 --> 00:17:45,332
the Technology Allied
Protection Service task force,

438
00:17:45,362 --> 00:17:47,082
- is that correct?
- It is, although

439
00:17:47,084 --> 00:17:50,252
I would not call myself
technically with the FBI.

440
00:17:50,254 --> 00:17:52,026
Does the FBI have a
steering committee, sir?

441
00:17:52,056 --> 00:17:54,811
- A...
- Steering committee.

442
00:17:55,646 --> 00:17:56,984
- No.
- Does the

443
00:17:57,014 --> 00:17:58,995
Secret Service or the Chicago PD?

444
00:17:59,025 --> 00:18:00,896
- Not that I know of.
- How about TAPS?

445
00:18:00,898 --> 00:18:03,232
Does they have a steering committee?

446
00:18:03,901 --> 00:18:04,967
Yes, they do.

447
00:18:04,969 --> 00:18:07,002
And, um, who serves on this committee?

448
00:18:07,004 --> 00:18:10,472
Law enforcement. Experts in their fields.

449
00:18:12,156 --> 00:18:13,212
And...

450
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,344
I'm not sure what you want me to say.

451
00:18:15,346 --> 00:18:18,080
CEOs of Silicon Valley's
14 biggest companies...

452
00:18:18,082 --> 00:18:20,514
don't they serve on the
steering committee too?

453
00:18:20,544 --> 00:18:21,345
DUNST: That's right.

454
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:22,384
Including Neil Gross?

455
00:18:22,386 --> 00:18:23,578
Objection. Relevance.

456
00:18:23,608 --> 00:18:25,287
I am just trying to identify

457
00:18:25,289 --> 00:18:27,189
who Agent Dunst reports to.

458
00:18:27,191 --> 00:18:29,124
Your Honor, the TAPS steering committee

459
00:18:29,126 --> 00:18:32,516
coordinates the protection
of the country's technology,

460
00:18:32,546 --> 00:18:34,053
which is a national security issue.

461
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:37,299
And you know how much I love
my national security secure.

462
00:18:37,301 --> 00:18:40,985
Uh, I'm guessing that the
answer to Mrs. Florrick's

463
00:18:41,015 --> 00:18:43,939
question is, "Yes,

464
00:18:43,941 --> 00:18:45,741
I do report to Neil Gross."

465
00:18:45,743 --> 00:18:48,465
- That is correct.
- Well, then I've heard the answer.

466
00:18:48,495 --> 00:18:49,344
Overruled.

467
00:18:49,346 --> 00:18:51,146
Did TAPS receive a grant from Chumhum?

468
00:18:51,148 --> 00:18:52,552
Objection.

469
00:18:52,582 --> 00:18:54,149
Did your unit receive

470
00:18:54,151 --> 00:18:56,051
a grant from Chumhum, agent?

471
00:18:56,053 --> 00:18:57,319
Yes, Your Honor.

472
00:18:57,321 --> 00:18:59,221
So now I've heard that answer too.

473
00:18:59,223 --> 00:19:00,945
- Overruled.
- Agent Dunst,

474
00:19:00,975 --> 00:19:03,508
isn't it true that last year alone,

475
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:05,383
four agents from TAPS

476
00:19:05,413 --> 00:19:07,876
left for senior jobs at
Chumhum's security department?

477
00:19:07,906 --> 00:19:09,982
Objection. These questions are irrelevant.

478
00:19:09,984 --> 00:19:11,361
Were there grounds to arrest the defendant?

479
00:19:11,391 --> 00:19:12,751
That's the only question that matters here.

480
00:19:12,753 --> 00:19:13,707
This is a massive

481
00:19:13,737 --> 00:19:15,704
conflict of interest, Your Honor.

482
00:19:15,706 --> 00:19:17,339
TAPS is effectively acting

483
00:19:17,341 --> 00:19:19,985
as Mr. Gross' personal security force.

484
00:19:22,851 --> 00:19:25,881
TAPS is a legitimate law
enforcement organization.

485
00:19:26,154 --> 00:19:27,516
Issues of conflict of interest

486
00:19:27,518 --> 00:19:30,719
are more appropriate for trial, counselor.

487
00:19:30,721 --> 00:19:34,389
So for the moment the is only question is,

488
00:19:34,391 --> 00:19:37,359
is there enough evidence
to hold your client?

489
00:19:38,148 --> 00:19:40,996
Oh, good, uh, Lucca, we need
you on the Dipple filing.

490
00:19:40,998 --> 00:19:44,190
Oh, I'm in the midst of the Howell defense.

491
00:19:45,318 --> 00:19:47,069
- I thought that was Alicia.
- It is.

492
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:48,787
But it's-it's me too.

493
00:19:49,717 --> 00:19:52,250
Actually, we would rather
have you on the Dipple filing,

494
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,947
if that's all right.
You can work with Monica.

495
00:19:54,977 --> 00:19:57,734
You'll love working with
her. She's fantastic.

496
00:19:57,994 --> 00:19:58,994
<i>Monica...</i>

497
00:20:00,377 --> 00:20:01,852
do you remember Lucca?

498
00:20:01,882 --> 00:20:04,653
Yes. From the Safe Filter suit.

499
00:20:04,655 --> 00:20:06,482
Well, now you're on the same side.

500
00:20:06,512 --> 00:20:08,121
Yes, now we are.

501
00:20:08,151 --> 00:20:09,541
Can you show Lucca what we're doing?

502
00:20:09,543 --> 00:20:11,141
Sure can.

503
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:17,522
So... I'm supposed to really like you.

504
00:20:17,552 --> 00:20:21,353
Yes, let's share about
our common experiences.

505
00:20:23,716 --> 00:20:24,556
<i>Blake Reedy,</i>

506
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:27,194
design engineer on the
Foil development team.

507
00:20:27,224 --> 00:20:28,706
I designed the home button...

508
00:20:28,736 --> 00:20:31,265
with Mr. Gross' input, of course.

509
00:20:31,295 --> 00:20:32,631
And you brought the prototype

510
00:20:32,633 --> 00:20:34,179
with you to the Deviceroy conference?

511
00:20:34,209 --> 00:20:35,530
Yeah. I'd work on it during breaks.

512
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,365
And how can you be sure

513
00:20:37,395 --> 00:20:39,919
you didn't lose it during
one of those breaks?

514
00:20:39,949 --> 00:20:42,380
My backpack has a power
plug. When I'm not working

515
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:44,543
on the device, it's always
plugged in there, charging.

516
00:20:44,545 --> 00:20:47,182
And did you take the tablet
out during the after-party?

517
00:20:47,212 --> 00:20:49,081
No, it was in my bag the whole time.

518
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:51,450
But I remember that guy

519
00:20:51,452 --> 00:20:53,323
bumping into me by the martini bar.

520
00:20:53,353 --> 00:20:55,368
- Mr. Howell, the defendant?
- Yeah.

521
00:20:55,398 --> 00:20:58,357
And when I got back to my
hotel room 20 minutes later,

522
00:20:58,359 --> 00:21:00,970
- I saw the Foil was gone.
- Thank you.

523
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,462
Uh, so you never took the
device out of your backpack?

524
00:21:03,464 --> 00:21:06,331
I was like a Secret Service
guy carrying the football.

525
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:07,699
(Chuckles softly)

526
00:21:07,701 --> 00:21:09,835
Um, this is from the comments section

527
00:21:09,837 --> 00:21:12,388
of the tech blog Gadgy.

528
00:21:12,418 --> 00:21:14,406
Uh, a woman named CandyCane posted

529
00:21:14,408 --> 00:21:17,376
about a "geek-hot engineer" who showed her

530
00:21:17,378 --> 00:21:19,504
the Foil prototype at the Deviceroy party.

531
00:21:19,534 --> 00:21:21,981
Was there another geek-hot
engineer with the prototype?

532
00:21:22,011 --> 00:21:23,008
Objection.

533
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:27,992
Sustained. Harris, where
are we with the bug spray?

534
00:21:28,022 --> 00:21:28,987
Working on it, Your Honor.

535
00:21:28,989 --> 00:21:31,089
Did you not show this woman the Foil

536
00:21:31,091 --> 00:21:32,413
to impress her?

537
00:21:32,443 --> 00:21:34,276
I-I didn't let her touch it or anything.

538
00:21:34,278 --> 00:21:36,526
But isn't it possible that

539
00:21:36,556 --> 00:21:37,985
you got distracted

540
00:21:38,015 --> 00:21:39,681
- and just left it?
- Objection.

541
00:21:39,711 --> 00:21:40,716
Asked and answered.

542
00:21:40,718 --> 00:21:42,017
Sure. Sustained.

543
00:21:42,019 --> 00:21:43,652
Could you read this text

544
00:21:43,654 --> 00:21:46,688
which is from your... coworker?

545
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:50,192
How did you... how did you get this?

546
00:21:50,194 --> 00:21:51,848
- From your coworker.
- Objection, your Honor.

547
00:21:51,878 --> 00:21:53,268
What is this document?

548
00:21:53,298 --> 00:21:56,164
Uh, well, from what the
counselor just told us

549
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:57,915
it seems to be a text message.

550
00:21:57,945 --> 00:22:00,702
And from all appearances, your witness

551
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:02,948
recognizes it. So what is the objection?

552
00:22:02,978 --> 00:22:05,886
- Foundation.
- Sure. That's an objection.

553
00:22:05,916 --> 00:22:06,575
Overruled.

554
00:22:06,577 --> 00:22:08,043
ALICIA: Could you read the text message?

555
00:22:08,045 --> 00:22:09,711
Um, "My bad.

556
00:22:10,193 --> 00:22:11,246
"Gotta tell NG.

557
00:22:11,248 --> 00:22:12,353
NG will kill me."

558
00:22:12,383 --> 00:22:14,149
NG being Neil Gross?

559
00:22:14,151 --> 00:22:15,684
- Yeah.
- Didn't you fabricate

560
00:22:15,686 --> 00:22:17,753
the whole theft story
because you were afraid

561
00:22:17,755 --> 00:22:19,396
NG might kill you?

562
00:22:19,426 --> 00:22:21,025
No.

563
00:22:21,055 --> 00:22:22,724
Then what does that text refer to?

564
00:22:22,726 --> 00:22:25,954
- It being stolen.
- So why is it "your bad" if it was stolen?

565
00:22:25,984 --> 00:22:28,771
I don't know. Because I was
being inexact in my language?

566
00:22:28,801 --> 00:22:30,198
Okay.

567
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:33,385
When TAPS questioned you, did Mr. Gross

568
00:22:33,387 --> 00:22:35,053
instruct them what to ask you?

569
00:22:35,055 --> 00:22:37,398
GADES: Objection. We've been over this.

570
00:22:37,428 --> 00:22:39,598
Yup. Yeah, you lost this one earlier,

571
00:22:39,628 --> 00:22:41,593
Mrs. Florrick. Sustained.

572
00:22:41,936 --> 00:22:44,129
Nothing further.

573
00:22:45,832 --> 00:22:47,666
I'm losing, aren't I?

574
00:22:48,519 --> 00:22:50,635
We have to shift gears.

575
00:22:52,192 --> 00:22:54,291
The Hard Core has protein, almonds,

576
00:22:54,321 --> 00:22:56,513
turbinado and one hell
of an ice cream headache.

577
00:22:56,543 --> 00:22:57,585
ELI: Marissa!

578
00:22:57,615 --> 00:22:58,981
- Dad.
- I need you now!

579
00:22:59,011 --> 00:23:01,652
Um... I'll be right back.

580
00:23:03,611 --> 00:23:05,342
- What the hell?
- Did the Fed ask you

581
00:23:05,372 --> 00:23:06,641
any questions about Alicia?

582
00:23:06,671 --> 00:23:09,117
No. I mentioned her, and
he asked what she was like,

583
00:23:09,147 --> 00:23:10,622
but I didn't say anything.

584
00:23:10,624 --> 00:23:12,922
- He called again and asked me out.
- Who, Hlavin?

585
00:23:12,952 --> 00:23:14,826
Yeah. Just a few hours ago.

586
00:23:14,828 --> 00:23:17,262
I was thinking "no," but
maybe I should say "yes."

587
00:23:17,264 --> 00:23:18,602
Is he after Alicia?

588
00:23:18,632 --> 00:23:21,199
- I don't know.
- Do you want me to find out?

589
00:23:21,664 --> 00:23:23,064
You'll be careful?

590
00:23:23,337 --> 00:23:24,756
Always.

591
00:23:33,324 --> 00:23:36,839
- Eli.
- So the 27th floor again.

592
00:23:36,876 --> 00:23:39,076
Everything comes full circle, doesn't it?

593
00:23:39,078 --> 00:23:40,192
Yes.

594
00:23:40,222 --> 00:23:43,720
First the tragedy, and then the farce.

595
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:45,517
You need something?

596
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:47,352
We're good, yes?

597
00:23:47,693 --> 00:23:51,289
- We're good.
- I think Feds are investigating you.

598
00:23:51,578 --> 00:23:53,858
And your chair is tilted.

599
00:23:56,327 --> 00:23:57,829
They're investigating me for what?

600
00:23:57,831 --> 00:23:59,171
I don't know. I'm trying to find out.

601
00:23:59,201 --> 00:24:00,595
It could be the Judge Schakowsky bribe.

602
00:24:00,625 --> 00:24:01,513
I had nothing to do with that.

603
00:24:01,543 --> 00:24:03,019
Or the electoral board vote.

604
00:24:03,049 --> 00:24:05,686
I need you to call me if
Roland Hlavin comes by.

605
00:24:05,716 --> 00:24:07,404
- Him?
- Mm-hmm.

606
00:24:07,434 --> 00:24:08,842
He approached Marissa.

607
00:24:08,872 --> 00:24:12,235
Oh, God. It never ends.

608
00:24:12,265 --> 00:24:14,039
Neil Gross is a fascist.

609
00:24:14,069 --> 00:24:16,827
And fascists must not
be allowed to terrorize.

610
00:24:16,857 --> 00:24:20,734
- Mr. Dudewitz, hello.
- Hello, lawyer, other lawyer.

611
00:24:20,764 --> 00:24:22,362
- I'm not a lawyer.
- Do I care?

612
00:24:22,392 --> 00:24:25,529
I am here, as requested,
to stand up to the bully.

613
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:27,926
- I'll be in touch.
- Yup.

614
00:24:27,928 --> 00:24:30,422
Here's the Howell file, Alicia.

615
00:24:30,452 --> 00:24:31,930
Where are you going?

616
00:24:31,932 --> 00:24:34,849
Me? Upstairs, on another case.

617
00:24:34,879 --> 00:24:38,069
What other case? There's
no other case. I'm here.

618
00:24:38,071 --> 00:24:39,179
This is the case.

619
00:24:39,209 --> 00:24:40,650
LUCCA: Diane has me on Dipple.

620
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,507
Stay. I'll talk to Diane.

621
00:24:43,537 --> 00:24:45,473
Great. Now what do you want?

622
00:24:45,503 --> 00:24:48,413
We want what you know about the Foil.

623
00:24:48,415 --> 00:24:50,081
It's a marketing stunt.

624
00:24:50,083 --> 00:24:51,581
LUCCA: What part of it, Mr. Dudewitz?

625
00:24:51,611 --> 00:24:54,519
All of it. The lost device,
the arrest of that guy there.

626
00:24:54,521 --> 00:24:57,355
The... The... Aren't you supposed to be

627
00:24:57,385 --> 00:24:58,342
sitting up there?

628
00:24:58,372 --> 00:25:01,061
Yes, but it's opposite day.

629
00:25:01,091 --> 00:25:02,090
See? No gavel, either.

630
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,429
LUCCA: Uh, please continue, Mr. Dudewitz.

631
00:25:04,431 --> 00:25:05,556
What's your name again?

632
00:25:05,586 --> 00:25:06,837
- Lucca.
- I love that name.

633
00:25:06,867 --> 00:25:08,881
- How'd you get that name?
- GADES: Objection, Your Honor.

634
00:25:08,911 --> 00:25:13,171
- Relevance.
- I know, but yet, I'm... I'm curious, too.

635
00:25:13,173 --> 00:25:16,413
- Uh, you may answer.
- My parents traveled a lot.

636
00:25:16,443 --> 00:25:18,982
I was this close to
being called "Budapest."

637
00:25:19,012 --> 00:25:21,980
Budapest. That's funny.
What was the question again?

638
00:25:21,982 --> 00:25:25,249
You were saying, um,
this is a marketing stunt.

639
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:27,762
Yes. The lost Foil, this proceeding.

640
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:31,305
It's a piece of theatre. No,
it's a piece of tragic-comedy

641
00:25:31,335 --> 00:25:32,687
conjured up by Neil Gross,

642
00:25:32,717 --> 00:25:34,393
the great carnival barker of our time.

643
00:25:34,423 --> 00:25:37,495
- Objection. Relevance.
- LUCCA: Your Honor, if this is

644
00:25:37,497 --> 00:25:40,171
indeed a marketing stunt,
then there is no crime,

645
00:25:40,201 --> 00:25:41,538
which would mean no probable cause.

646
00:25:41,568 --> 00:25:44,178
- I'll hear it out. Overruled.
- LUCCA: What specifically

647
00:25:44,208 --> 00:25:45,392
makes you think this is a marketing stunt?

648
00:25:45,422 --> 00:25:48,006
We talked about the same thing
with our first product launch.

649
00:25:48,008 --> 00:25:51,576
Mr. Gross... and I use
"mister" guardedly...

650
00:25:51,578 --> 00:25:53,412
he's about to launch his first foray

651
00:25:53,414 --> 00:25:54,813
into personal computing devices

652
00:25:54,815 --> 00:25:58,021
where products die bloody, violent deaths.

653
00:25:58,051 --> 00:25:59,472
He's invested $800 million.

654
00:25:59,502 --> 00:26:01,147
Why would he let a
prototype off his premises?

655
00:26:01,177 --> 00:26:03,422
So Chumhum's security lapse was intended?

656
00:26:03,424 --> 00:26:05,304
Objection. Speculation.

657
00:26:05,685 --> 00:26:08,272
Let me hear a bit more, then I'll rule.

658
00:26:08,302 --> 00:26:09,494
DUDEWITZ: Chumhum's security

659
00:26:09,496 --> 00:26:10,682
is legendary.

660
00:26:10,712 --> 00:26:13,307
That compound is more fortified
than a missile silo in Kansas.

661
00:26:13,337 --> 00:26:17,044
- So why leak the prototype?
- The Foil's a great product. Kudos, Neil.

662
00:26:17,074 --> 00:26:19,652
At least you have the smarts
to hire people smarter than you,

663
00:26:19,682 --> 00:26:20,772
which actually isn't that difficult.

664
00:26:20,774 --> 00:26:22,707
Anthony...

665
00:26:22,982 --> 00:26:25,449
It's the umpteenth tablet in the market.

666
00:26:25,479 --> 00:26:26,900
It has a closed operating system.

667
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:28,297
Nobody's building apps for it.

668
00:26:28,299 --> 00:26:29,914
Bottom line, nobody cares.

669
00:26:29,944 --> 00:26:32,185
LUCCA: So the arrest of Mr. Howell boosts

670
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:34,413
its profile by generating publicity?

671
00:26:34,443 --> 00:26:36,927
It does. Neil Gross is a jackass,

672
00:26:36,957 --> 00:26:38,156
but he's no dummy.

673
00:26:38,567 --> 00:26:39,563
Thank you, Mr. Dudewitz.

674
00:26:39,593 --> 00:26:43,068
Anytime. For you.

675
00:26:43,098 --> 00:26:46,043
Now I have to deal with
mediocrity, yes? This lady.

676
00:26:46,073 --> 00:26:47,942
Just a few questions, Mr. Dudewitz.

677
00:26:47,972 --> 00:26:50,487
- Sure. I can't wait.
- How do you beat the retina scan

678
00:26:50,517 --> 00:26:52,314
- at Chumhum's labs?
- I have no idea.

679
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:55,255
That's because there is
no retina scan at Chumhum.

680
00:26:55,285 --> 00:26:57,690
Ah, you got me. I'm red-faced.

681
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:01,660
You have no idea of the security
measures at Chumhum, do you?

682
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:04,470
I don't. I'm as innocent
as a suckling babe.

683
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,972
You and Mr. Gross

684
00:27:06,002 --> 00:27:08,078
started out together at
Freemont Labs, correct?

685
00:27:08,108 --> 00:27:11,356
Yes, that's where Neil tried to write
code... with his own feces.

686
00:27:11,358 --> 00:27:12,830
And you still subscribe to

687
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:14,665
the Research Labs' philosophy

688
00:27:14,695 --> 00:27:16,361
that technology should be shared

689
00:27:16,363 --> 00:27:18,621
and not sold for profit, correct?

690
00:27:18,651 --> 00:27:20,065
You told her to go down that road, Neil?

691
00:27:20,067 --> 00:27:22,245
- Mr. Dudewitz...
- Did you also tell her about

692
00:27:22,275 --> 00:27:24,449
how you created the code for Chumhum

693
00:27:24,479 --> 00:27:27,372
after our visit to the
Freemont Research Labs?

694
00:27:27,374 --> 00:27:29,909
- Perhaps we can get that in the record.
- FERRIS: Mr. Dudewitz,

695
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:32,691
you are to answer the attorney's questions.

696
00:27:32,721 --> 00:27:35,893
Do not address anyone else in the court.

697
00:27:35,923 --> 00:27:37,015
Withdrawn, Your Honor.

698
00:27:37,017 --> 00:27:38,488
- No further questions.
- Excuse me?

699
00:27:38,518 --> 00:27:40,727
GADES: We're done here.
No further questions.

700
00:27:40,757 --> 00:27:43,021
What just happened?

701
00:27:43,023 --> 00:27:45,123
I think we just landed a sucker punch.

702
00:27:45,125 --> 00:27:46,791
(Chatter, phones ringing)

703
00:27:47,567 --> 00:27:48,567
Hello?

704
00:27:49,998 --> 00:27:51,979
Who have you been talking to, Eli Gold?

705
00:27:52,009 --> 00:27:52,831
Ruth.

706
00:27:52,833 --> 00:27:54,073
I thought you'd been sucked up

707
00:27:54,103 --> 00:27:56,082
into all those snow belt governors' races.

708
00:27:56,112 --> 00:27:59,242
- I've kept busy.
- So, to what do I owe this honor?

709
00:27:59,272 --> 00:28:03,408
Oh, not so much an honor as a bad feeling.

710
00:28:03,732 --> 00:28:05,732
Where'd you get that painting?

711
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:07,479
Courtney Paige.

712
00:28:07,481 --> 00:28:09,710
It makes me nervous.
All those people staring,

713
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:11,442
like they want something.

714
00:28:11,472 --> 00:28:13,178
I think it's about revolution.

715
00:28:13,208 --> 00:28:15,954
Are you sure? They seem to be singing.

716
00:28:15,956 --> 00:28:19,094
- And those trees.
- ELI: Well, you know. Art.

717
00:28:19,562 --> 00:28:20,836
Are you out to get me, Eli?

718
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:22,883
Am I... out to get you?

719
00:28:22,913 --> 00:28:24,550
No. Why? Should I be?

720
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:26,431
You seem to have waited
until I was good and gone

721
00:28:26,433 --> 00:28:27,766
to get a little revenge.

722
00:28:27,768 --> 00:28:28,807
What are you babbling about?

723
00:28:28,837 --> 00:28:31,936
Grand jury subpoena... from the FBI.

724
00:28:33,006 --> 00:28:35,974
Well, I'm sure it's just a standard

725
00:28:36,379 --> 00:28:37,764
post-campaign wind-down.

726
00:28:37,794 --> 00:28:40,681
You know, checking we dotted
our Is and crossed our Ts.

727
00:28:40,711 --> 00:28:42,784
I've done that drill more than once,

728
00:28:42,814 --> 00:28:46,089
and it does not include
an FBI interrogation.

729
00:28:46,119 --> 00:28:48,892
Well, my advice is,
don't make too much of it.

730
00:28:48,922 --> 00:28:50,796
Eli, if you're setting me up here,

731
00:28:50,826 --> 00:28:51,856
I will take your skinny little head...

732
00:28:51,858 --> 00:28:53,530
I am not setting you up.

733
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,994
And I give you my word,
if I get even an inkling

734
00:28:55,996 --> 00:28:58,496
that you are in jeopardy,
I will let you know.

735
00:29:01,558 --> 00:29:03,508
We may be mercenaries, but...

736
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:06,237
even mercenaries have a code.

737
00:29:06,497 --> 00:29:09,479
- (Hits envelope)
- When this thing's over...

738
00:29:09,509 --> 00:29:11,176
It's over.

739
00:29:12,094 --> 00:29:13,773
I promise.

740
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:18,316
(Phone ringing)

741
00:29:18,851 --> 00:29:20,719
You do realize your
timing chronically sucks.

742
00:29:20,749 --> 00:29:22,120
I need you to do something for me.

743
00:29:22,122 --> 00:29:23,254
Now? The store is packed.

744
00:29:23,256 --> 00:29:24,394
Well, tell them to buy

745
00:29:24,424 --> 00:29:26,918
juice at 7-11 like normal people!

746
00:29:26,948 --> 00:29:28,570
I need you to call your friend Roland

747
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,388
or Scott, or whatever his name is.

748
00:29:30,418 --> 00:29:31,375
What? Why?

749
00:29:31,405 --> 00:29:33,605
I need you to set up another date.

750
00:29:35,189 --> 00:29:36,189
(Sighs)

751
00:29:37,091 --> 00:29:38,541
Hey, where's Lucca?

752
00:29:39,041 --> 00:29:40,238
I don't know.

753
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,790
Wasn't she here helping you?

754
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:44,320
I think they needed her on another case.

755
00:29:44,354 --> 00:29:45,213
Here she is.

756
00:29:45,243 --> 00:29:48,003
Oh, Lu... What?

757
00:29:48,332 --> 00:29:50,081
- MAN: No, right there...
- Excuse me.

758
00:29:50,083 --> 00:29:51,117
What's going on?

759
00:29:51,147 --> 00:29:53,318
We have a warrant authorizing
the search of these premises

760
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,629
for the missing Foil prototype.

761
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:57,289
Ah, wait. Hold on. We're
Mr. Howell's attorneys.

762
00:29:57,291 --> 00:29:59,294
Anything you find here is work product,

763
00:29:59,324 --> 00:30:00,489
and, therefore, privileged.

764
00:30:00,519 --> 00:30:03,328
This also happens to be
Howell's place of work,

765
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:04,757
so, yes, we're authorized.

766
00:30:04,787 --> 00:30:07,700
Mr. Howell's cubicle is
downstairs. Your search will be

767
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:09,090
confined to his work space

768
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,069
- and will be supervised by one of us.
- No ma'am.

769
00:30:11,099 --> 00:30:12,170
As IT specialist,

770
00:30:12,172 --> 00:30:13,638
he has access to every

771
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,473
cubicle and office on the premises,

772
00:30:15,475 --> 00:30:17,409
so we'll search where we like. Excuse me.

773
00:30:17,411 --> 00:30:19,878
(Indistinct, overlapping chatter)

774
00:30:22,709 --> 00:30:26,015
- They won't find anything.
- How can you be sure?

775
00:30:28,024 --> 00:30:29,581
Because I have it.

776
00:30:35,702 --> 00:30:37,883
DIANE: You were told multiple
times the firm would have nothing

777
00:30:37,913 --> 00:30:41,151
- to do with this device.
- I didn't take it to help broker a sale.

778
00:30:41,181 --> 00:30:43,181
It all happened in the moment.

779
00:30:43,489 --> 00:30:44,382
When they arrested him,

780
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:47,341
Howell panicked and
stashed it in my cubicle.

781
00:30:47,371 --> 00:30:49,759
They're losing the probable cause hearing.

782
00:30:49,789 --> 00:30:51,773
- This is their pushback.
- We should give them their device.

783
00:30:51,775 --> 00:30:55,911
We can't do that. It's bound
up in attorney-client privilege.

784
00:30:56,914 --> 00:30:58,280
(Sighs)

785
00:30:58,515 --> 00:31:00,082
We should talk.

786
00:31:00,996 --> 00:31:02,584
Alicia, do you have a minute?

787
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:08,337
So, we have to find a
working rhythm here again.

788
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:11,217
I know. The Howell case
got a bit out of hand.

789
00:31:12,279 --> 00:31:14,079
No, it's bigger than that.

790
00:31:15,606 --> 00:31:16,442
Okay.

791
00:31:16,472 --> 00:31:18,152
When Cary suggested

792
00:31:18,182 --> 00:31:21,608
that you come back, I wasn't against it,

793
00:31:22,024 --> 00:31:25,402
but I was afraid that
there might be a few bumps.

794
00:31:25,432 --> 00:31:27,538
Which bumps might those be?

795
00:31:27,568 --> 00:31:29,991
A certain independence

796
00:31:30,406 --> 00:31:32,406
and a resistance to oversight.

797
00:31:34,237 --> 00:31:35,237
Okay.

798
00:31:35,736 --> 00:31:38,286
Tell me how you would like me to improve.

799
00:31:41,164 --> 00:31:43,014
Lucca isn't your associate.

800
00:31:43,771 --> 00:31:45,671
She is the firm's associate.

801
00:31:45,772 --> 00:31:46,922
I understand.

802
00:31:47,719 --> 00:31:50,138
She caught the Howell
case with me, so I thought

803
00:31:50,168 --> 00:31:53,307
the associate that caught
the case stays with the case.

804
00:31:53,337 --> 00:31:54,726
Sometimes.

805
00:31:55,055 --> 00:31:56,443
If the partners agree.

806
00:31:56,473 --> 00:31:57,473
I see.

807
00:31:58,823 --> 00:32:02,523
I'm sorry. I should have checked
with you first. Anything else?

808
00:32:04,546 --> 00:32:08,231
Lucca needs to know that she
is answerable to the firm,

809
00:32:08,261 --> 00:32:09,500
and not just to you.

810
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:11,159
And that's why you have
her on the Dipple case?

811
00:32:11,189 --> 00:32:14,367
No. I have her on the Dipple case

812
00:32:14,397 --> 00:32:17,447
because we needed an
associate on the Dipple case.

813
00:32:19,693 --> 00:32:20,693
Diane,

814
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:23,570
I'm thrilled to be back.

815
00:32:23,776 --> 00:32:25,700
I want to be of service.

816
00:32:26,057 --> 00:32:27,469
But I also return with

817
00:32:27,471 --> 00:32:30,469
some cases, clients and knowledge.

818
00:32:30,499 --> 00:32:32,199
You mean, in bond court?

819
00:32:33,831 --> 00:32:34,943
Yes,

820
00:32:35,289 --> 00:32:38,000
I do mean in bond court.

821
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:39,845
Lucca is good.

822
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:42,844
She's smart and forward-leaning

823
00:32:42,874 --> 00:32:44,519
and a prodigy.

824
00:32:45,108 --> 00:32:47,475
And with respect,

825
00:32:47,874 --> 00:32:50,074
she shouldn't be given grunt work.

826
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:53,122
Your advice is welcome.

827
00:32:53,152 --> 00:32:55,023
The partners will consider it.

828
00:32:55,053 --> 00:32:56,531
Thank you.

829
00:32:59,317 --> 00:33:00,202
Anything else?

830
00:33:00,232 --> 00:33:02,204
No, you can go.

831
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:14,874
Hypothetical, Mr. Gross.

832
00:33:14,904 --> 00:33:18,801
Suppose I knew where
the Foil prototype was.

833
00:33:19,286 --> 00:33:20,888
Melodramatic opening,

834
00:33:20,918 --> 00:33:21,590
but I'm listening.

835
00:33:21,592 --> 00:33:25,699
If I could convince my client to return it,

836
00:33:25,729 --> 00:33:28,145
would you convince TAPS
to drop the charges?

837
00:33:28,175 --> 00:33:29,829
I would on the condition

838
00:33:29,859 --> 00:33:31,756
that he also tell me exactly how he got it.

839
00:33:31,786 --> 00:33:33,161
- No.
- Then we have nothing

840
00:33:33,191 --> 00:33:35,194
to hypothetically negotiate.

841
00:33:35,224 --> 00:33:36,648
Dudewitz is right about you.

842
00:33:36,678 --> 00:33:38,518
You think you're so indispensable

843
00:33:38,548 --> 00:33:40,132
to the fabric of modern society

844
00:33:40,162 --> 00:33:41,876
that you've even bought
your own a police force

845
00:33:41,906 --> 00:33:44,410
to do your dirty work under color of law.

846
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,874
Goliath stomping David, right?

847
00:33:47,116 --> 00:33:50,060
You know what these TAPS
agents are, Mrs. Florrick?

848
00:33:50,511 --> 00:33:52,117
They are heroes.

849
00:33:52,948 --> 00:33:54,363
Really?

850
00:33:54,393 --> 00:33:56,522
And why is that, Mr. Gross?

851
00:33:56,552 --> 00:33:59,856
Because the Goliaths are the new Davids.

852
00:33:59,886 --> 00:34:02,111
The model of scruffy
kids toiling in a garage

853
00:34:02,141 --> 00:34:03,501
is a quaint anachronism.

854
00:34:03,531 --> 00:34:09,784
This isn't 1953, 1973 or even 2003.

855
00:34:09,814 --> 00:34:11,105
The great innovations today

856
00:34:11,107 --> 00:34:13,824
are coming out of
corporate labs, not garages.

857
00:34:13,854 --> 00:34:16,580
Everyone thinks Goliath is the villain,

858
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:17,805
but the truth is that today,

859
00:34:17,835 --> 00:34:20,554
more often than not, he is a victim.

860
00:34:20,584 --> 00:34:21,429
And he needs protection.

861
00:34:21,459 --> 00:34:24,338
Objection. Relevance, not
to mention self-aggrandizing.

862
00:34:24,368 --> 00:34:28,189
Let's get back to
probable cause, Ms. Gades.

863
00:34:28,523 --> 00:34:30,523
Uh, Harris...

864
00:34:30,553 --> 00:34:31,626
they're back.

865
00:34:31,628 --> 00:34:33,494
I have another call in, Your Honor.

866
00:34:33,496 --> 00:34:35,601
Well, they seem to be getting bigger.

867
00:34:35,631 --> 00:34:37,211
Your Honor, may I continue?

868
00:34:37,291 --> 00:34:39,631
- Go for it.
- Was the leak of the Foil

869
00:34:39,661 --> 00:34:42,253
a marketing stunt, as
Anthony Dudewitz alleges?

870
00:34:42,255 --> 00:34:47,003
Hmm. Anthony's currency
is, um, conspiracy theories.

871
00:34:47,033 --> 00:34:49,249
They make for fun segments
on Discovery Channel,

872
00:34:49,279 --> 00:34:51,200
but they don't comport with reality.

873
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:53,347
No. No, this was not a marketing stunt.

874
00:34:53,377 --> 00:34:55,138
GADES: But this incident has garnered

875
00:34:55,168 --> 00:34:56,708
publicity for the Foil, has it not?

876
00:34:56,738 --> 00:34:57,912
I can generate publicity

877
00:34:57,942 --> 00:34:59,537
in a million different ways.

878
00:34:59,539 --> 00:35:01,705
I'm a carnival barker, remember?

879
00:35:01,865 --> 00:35:03,329
No, I would never leak the Foil

880
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:05,192
for one simple reason.

881
00:35:05,194 --> 00:35:07,161
I don't launch defective products.

882
00:35:07,586 --> 00:35:09,158
- What is he talking about?
- I don't know.

883
00:35:09,188 --> 00:35:11,665
GADES: Are you saying
the product is defective?

884
00:35:12,072 --> 00:35:13,334
Yes, in its current state.

885
00:35:13,364 --> 00:35:16,254
The... the swipe function
has a rebound effect.

886
00:35:16,284 --> 00:35:19,106
It's barely visible, but it's
enough to keep me up at night.

887
00:35:19,458 --> 00:35:21,896
And even Anthony Dudewitz can tell you,

888
00:35:21,926 --> 00:35:24,111
I would never use a stunt to leak a product

889
00:35:24,653 --> 00:35:25,769
that is not perfect.

890
00:35:25,799 --> 00:35:27,237
Thank you, sir.

891
00:35:27,267 --> 00:35:30,510
- ALICIA: Mr. Gross...
- FERRIS: That's okay, Mrs. Florrick.

892
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:31,439
I've heard enough.

893
00:35:31,469 --> 00:35:32,294
What? I'd like to cross.

894
00:35:32,324 --> 00:35:33,738
Mr. Gross has convinced me

895
00:35:33,768 --> 00:35:36,426
that this wasn't a marketing stunt.

896
00:35:37,006 --> 00:35:38,461
Uh, there.

897
00:35:38,841 --> 00:35:40,234
- I saved you your cross.
- Your Honor...

898
00:35:40,264 --> 00:35:42,936
This is a preliminary
hearing, Mrs. Florrick,

899
00:35:42,966 --> 00:35:45,826
not a trial. You can revisit it then

900
00:35:45,856 --> 00:35:48,537
if you can't come up with something better.

901
00:35:49,039 --> 00:35:53,426
I'm entering a finding of probable cause.

902
00:35:53,456 --> 00:35:56,072
We'll set trial for six months from now.

903
00:35:57,926 --> 00:36:00,929
(Low chatter, music playing in background)

904
00:36:04,739 --> 00:36:06,391
You're wasting your time with Ruth Eastman.

905
00:36:06,421 --> 00:36:07,205
Am I now?

906
00:36:07,207 --> 00:36:09,489
I've worked with dozens
of political operatives,

907
00:36:09,519 --> 00:36:12,643
and Ruth is as upstanding as they come.

908
00:36:12,645 --> 00:36:14,032
I'm surprised.

909
00:36:14,062 --> 00:36:15,724
- That Ruth's legit?
- No.

910
00:36:15,754 --> 00:36:16,948
That you'd defend her after she

911
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:19,534
pushed you out of Governor
Florrick's campaign.

912
00:36:19,564 --> 00:36:21,179
Well, you know.

913
00:36:21,209 --> 00:36:22,386
Bygones.

914
00:36:22,388 --> 00:36:24,777
Hmm. From what I heard,
that wound up putting you

915
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:27,411
on the outs with the
entire Florrick family.

916
00:36:28,164 --> 00:36:29,293
What do you want to know,

917
00:36:29,323 --> 00:36:30,793
Agent Hlavin

918
00:36:30,823 --> 00:36:33,698
or Devereaux? Hmm?

919
00:36:33,973 --> 00:36:36,072
Instead of poking around with Ruth Eastman

920
00:36:36,102 --> 00:36:38,314
and God knows who else,
why don't you just ask me?

921
00:36:38,344 --> 00:36:41,439
- What do you want?
- You'll find out soon enough.

922
00:36:41,469 --> 00:36:43,479
There's a limit to how long
you can play this game

923
00:36:43,509 --> 00:36:45,243
before investigation

924
00:36:45,245 --> 00:36:46,799
turns into intimidation.

925
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:48,551
Are you threatening me?

926
00:36:49,742 --> 00:36:51,362
No, never.

927
00:36:52,388 --> 00:36:54,424
- Just observing.
- Be careful, Eli.

928
00:36:54,755 --> 00:36:56,454
I have the full resources of the FBI

929
00:36:56,456 --> 00:36:59,375
and the Justice Department
behind me on this,

930
00:36:59,405 --> 00:37:01,459
and we always get what we're after.

931
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:05,869
JASON: <i>Hey.</i>

932
00:37:05,899 --> 00:37:07,869
I heard about the hearing. I'm sorry.

933
00:37:07,899 --> 00:37:10,618
Yeah, looks like we're headed
towards a summer trial.

934
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:13,261
Well, on the upside, Howell
can at least make bail.

935
00:37:13,621 --> 00:37:15,742
He doesn't have $250,000.

936
00:37:15,772 --> 00:37:16,691
He will now.

937
00:37:16,693 --> 00:37:18,659
That tech blog site, Gadgy,

938
00:37:18,661 --> 00:37:22,286
just upped their bid to $250,000.

939
00:37:24,804 --> 00:37:26,030
Alicia?

940
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:30,555
Please tell me you haven't
been negotiating with Gadgy.

941
00:37:31,725 --> 00:37:33,883
I'm sorry, I haven't what?

942
00:37:33,913 --> 00:37:36,582
Gadgy just offered Howell $250,000,

943
00:37:36,612 --> 00:37:39,471
which means someone has
been talking to them,

944
00:37:39,501 --> 00:37:41,521
and it sure as hell couldn't have been him.

945
00:37:41,551 --> 00:37:42,807
And you think it was me?

946
00:37:42,837 --> 00:37:45,698
Well, you've been hell-bent on
proving Cary and Diane wrong.

947
00:37:45,728 --> 00:37:48,522
You can't dig in on principle
at a firm like this.

948
00:37:48,662 --> 00:37:50,858
I know that coming here
wasn't your first choice...

949
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:52,493
believe me, it wasn't mine...

950
00:37:52,495 --> 00:37:54,616
but our hand was forced.

951
00:37:55,493 --> 00:37:57,298
I think I found your guilty party.

952
00:37:57,869 --> 00:37:59,506
Or more accurately,

953
00:37:59,536 --> 00:38:03,194
419,000 guilty parties.

954
00:38:08,516 --> 00:38:09,922
ALICIA: Wait a minute.

955
00:38:09,952 --> 00:38:11,913
With all those followers,

956
00:38:11,915 --> 00:38:14,304
I think there's another way to go.

957
00:38:16,886 --> 00:38:18,632
- ELI: It's Peter.
- You sure?

958
00:38:18,662 --> 00:38:20,721
They don't bring the
full resources of the FBI

959
00:38:20,723 --> 00:38:23,623
<i>and</i> the Justice Department
against just anyone.

960
00:38:24,501 --> 00:38:26,147
They're trying to bring
down another governor.

961
00:38:26,177 --> 00:38:28,142
Which issue specifically?

962
00:38:28,851 --> 00:38:30,099
I don't know.

963
00:38:31,894 --> 00:38:33,187
You know what it's like.

964
00:38:33,589 --> 00:38:35,582
The longer you're in office,
the more things there are

965
00:38:35,612 --> 00:38:39,560
that are papered over, put away,

966
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:42,484
- massaged.
- Yes,

967
00:38:42,514 --> 00:38:44,370
but in my experience,

968
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,633
if you think back through all of the issues

969
00:38:46,663 --> 00:38:48,943
and figure which one
you never kept a file on,

970
00:38:48,973 --> 00:38:52,161
never took a note about,
never admitted to anyone...

971
00:38:52,191 --> 00:38:54,012
that's the one.

972
00:38:55,271 --> 00:38:57,081
You know...

973
00:38:58,229 --> 00:39:00,151
you were right.

974
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:02,508
- 'Bout what?
- Returning home after losing

975
00:39:02,538 --> 00:39:06,085
a presidential bid, Peter
had a target on his back...

976
00:39:08,064 --> 00:39:10,649
and someone's going to take a shot at him.

977
00:39:10,679 --> 00:39:12,480
Every time.

978
00:39:14,873 --> 00:39:16,617
Good luck, Eli.

979
00:39:20,618 --> 00:39:22,586
(Door opens)

980
00:39:23,789 --> 00:39:25,903
- (Door closes)
- (Sighs)

981
00:39:30,887 --> 00:39:33,180
All rise!

982
00:39:38,162 --> 00:39:42,148
(Plastic crinkling)

983
00:39:42,812 --> 00:39:45,924
So Christo seems to have been at work here.

984
00:39:45,954 --> 00:39:46,757
No.

985
00:39:46,787 --> 00:39:48,765
Pete from Maintenance.

986
00:39:48,795 --> 00:39:49,980
Ah.

987
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:51,600
So he didn't want to tent me, too?

988
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:54,037
No. He thinks this will do it.

989
00:39:54,067 --> 00:39:54,963
Great.

990
00:39:54,993 --> 00:39:56,189
Well.

991
00:39:56,219 --> 00:39:58,517
It's a real improvement here.

992
00:39:59,906 --> 00:40:03,076
So, we seem to have a new defense here

993
00:40:03,106 --> 00:40:04,459
we're trying, counselor?

994
00:40:04,489 --> 00:40:05,816
Well, not new.

995
00:40:05,846 --> 00:40:07,023
But true.

996
00:40:07,244 --> 00:40:08,551
Mr. Howell is a journalist.

997
00:40:08,581 --> 00:40:09,850
Really?!

998
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:11,725
- When did this happen?
- A citizen journalist.

999
00:40:11,755 --> 00:40:14,532
Mr. Howell is therefore entitled
to protect the identity

1000
00:40:14,534 --> 00:40:17,068
of the person from whom
he obtained the Foil

1001
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:18,429
and to do as he pleases with the device.

1002
00:40:18,459 --> 00:40:20,172
Mr. Howell is not a journalist.

1003
00:40:20,202 --> 00:40:21,449
He's a look-at-me with a smartphone.

1004
00:40:21,479 --> 00:40:23,614
His tweet about the Foil

1005
00:40:23,644 --> 00:40:25,995
falls within the definition of journalism.

1006
00:40:26,119 --> 00:40:28,919
He shared information in a public forum,

1007
00:40:28,949 --> 00:40:30,211
information he analyzed...

1008
00:40:30,241 --> 00:40:31,955
With five exclamation points?

1009
00:40:31,985 --> 00:40:33,754
That does not qualify as analysis.

1010
00:40:33,784 --> 00:40:36,131
And his post sparked public debate

1011
00:40:36,161 --> 00:40:37,707
about whether the Foil
would succeed or fail.

1012
00:40:37,737 --> 00:40:41,699
This so-called debate includes
an emoji of a flaming poop.

1013
00:40:41,729 --> 00:40:43,550
Well, it's not as though
he tweeted a picture

1014
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:45,415
of his johnson, Ms. Gades.

1015
00:40:45,445 --> 00:40:49,417
There's public interest in the Foil,

1016
00:40:49,998 --> 00:40:54,366
and his tweets added
to the public discourse,

1017
00:40:54,396 --> 00:40:57,107
uh, flaming poops notwithstanding.

1018
00:40:57,253 --> 00:41:02,541
This court therefore
considers the defendant...

1019
00:41:02,571 --> 00:41:03,965
a journalist.

1020
00:41:04,924 --> 00:41:07,602
Go free and go crazy, Mr. Howell.

1021
00:41:08,028 --> 00:41:09,971
(Bangs gavel)

1022
00:41:10,115 --> 00:41:12,207
(Laughing)

1023
00:41:14,747 --> 00:41:17,445
The journalism angle you
came up with was a home run.

1024
00:41:17,447 --> 00:41:19,014
- Nice job.
- Thank you.

1025
00:41:19,016 --> 00:41:21,316
Now I need you on something else.

1026
00:41:21,591 --> 00:41:23,451
What?

1027
00:41:28,858 --> 00:41:30,725
So here we are.

1028
00:41:30,727 --> 00:41:31,986
Yep.

1029
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:34,873
Do you know any spirituals?

1030
00:41:34,903 --> 00:41:36,752
(Laughs softly)

1031
00:41:38,134 --> 00:41:39,134
Ruth?

1032
00:41:40,014 --> 00:41:42,259
What a nice surprise.

1033
00:41:42,289 --> 00:41:44,429
I was in town, figured I'd bring you

1034
00:41:44,459 --> 00:41:46,424
a little office-warming present.

1035
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:48,129
El Audaz.

1036
00:41:48,159 --> 00:41:49,828
It means "the bold."

1037
00:41:50,105 --> 00:41:51,696
That strong, huh?

1038
00:41:51,698 --> 00:41:52,855
You'll see.

1039
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:56,162
Well, there is no time like the present.

1040
00:41:56,975 --> 00:41:58,003
Rough day?

1041
00:41:58,005 --> 00:41:59,304
It was a bumpy reentry.

1042
00:41:59,306 --> 00:42:00,631
Yes, I was surprised.

1043
00:42:00,661 --> 00:42:03,108
I thought you reveled in your independence.

1044
00:42:03,783 --> 00:42:07,416
Big decisions are easy when
you have no other options.

1045
00:42:10,469 --> 00:42:12,350
(Grunts, clears throat)

1046
00:42:12,352 --> 00:42:13,685
Oh, you weren't kidding.

1047
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:15,242
(Whoops)

1048
00:42:15,272 --> 00:42:17,639
- Never about tequila.
- (Laughs)

1049
00:42:17,977 --> 00:42:20,417
So, what are you up to now?

1050
00:42:20,447 --> 00:42:22,410
Couple governor races.

1051
00:42:22,412 --> 00:42:25,237
But coming off a presidential,
these statewides seem so simple.

1052
00:42:25,267 --> 00:42:26,481
I bet.

1053
00:42:27,058 --> 00:42:29,655
Mrs. Florrick, I don't want
you to get too comfortable.

1054
00:42:29,685 --> 00:42:31,820
You... What do you mean?

1055
00:42:31,822 --> 00:42:34,089
Your husband has a target on his back.

1056
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:37,758
Well, anyone in public life does.

1057
00:42:37,788 --> 00:42:39,145
No, but not like this.

1058
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:41,690
No question Peter loves you,

1059
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,321
but he can hurt you.

1060
00:42:43,705 --> 00:42:45,144
Drag you down.

1061
00:42:45,769 --> 00:42:47,746
Not only destroy everything you've done,

1062
00:42:47,776 --> 00:42:49,717
but everything you want to do.

1063
00:42:50,313 --> 00:42:53,374
Cash out while you still can.

1064
00:43:07,026 --> 00:43:08,769
(Clattering)

Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
