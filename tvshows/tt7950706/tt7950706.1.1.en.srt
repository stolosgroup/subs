2
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,039
Well, I was expecting a giant.

3
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,045
Lightning bolts
flying out of your fingers.

4
00:01:21,673 --> 00:01:24,886
They say you can do dark
magic, Maestro Leonardo.

5
00:01:24,887 --> 00:01:26,597
Open up!

6
00:01:26,598 --> 00:01:28,642
Now would be a good moment,
if you don't want to hang.

7
00:01:28,643 --> 00:01:30,981
Open up in the name of the Podesta!

8
00:01:32,943 --> 00:01:33,985
Arrest him.

9
00:01:33,986 --> 00:01:36,406
No. No!

10
00:01:36,407 --> 00:01:37,993
You're under arrest for murder.

11
00:01:42,041 --> 00:01:43,544
What else do they say about me?

12
00:01:45,339 --> 00:01:47,717
Some say you're a genius.

13
00:01:47,718 --> 00:01:48,969
Some?

14
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:50,347
And the others?

15
00:01:54,063 --> 00:01:56,024
The others are frightened.

16
00:01:57,527 --> 00:01:59,238
And what about you, Officer...

17
00:02:01,575 --> 00:02:02,775
Giraldi.

18
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,345
Giraldi.

19
00:02:13,346 --> 00:02:15,140
Tell me about this woman...

20
00:02:16,351 --> 00:02:17,937
Caterina da Cremona?

21
00:02:20,524 --> 00:02:22,402
Tell you what exactly?

22
00:02:22,403 --> 00:02:24,114
They say you quarreled.

23
00:02:25,575 --> 00:02:27,537
She burned some of your paintings.

24
00:02:28,997 --> 00:02:30,459
So you poisoned her.

25
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:34,590
If they say that, they lie.

26
00:02:37,846 --> 00:02:39,433
How well did you know her?

27
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:44,899
I knew the contours of her face

28
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,277
better than I know my own.

29
00:02:47,654 --> 00:02:48,990
What was she to you?

30
00:02:56,837 --> 00:02:58,173
She was love.

31
00:02:58,924 --> 00:03:00,134
A lover?

32
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:07,356
Do you ever stare at the sky?

33
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,526
The air,

34
00:03:11,863 --> 00:03:13,063
it has no color.

35
00:03:13,909 --> 00:03:15,119
It's invisible.

36
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,501
Yet the sky is stained blue.

37
00:03:19,502 --> 00:03:21,003
So...

38
00:03:21,004 --> 00:03:22,204
What?

39
00:03:24,636 --> 00:03:26,222
An enigma like the sky...

40
00:03:28,767 --> 00:03:30,312
That's what she was to me.

41
00:03:46,883 --> 00:03:49,428
Right, let's be having you.

42
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:51,223
Come on, hurry up.
Grab your boards.

43
00:03:53,143 --> 00:03:54,479
Here, your foot on here.

44
00:03:56,273 --> 00:03:59,904
Chin up, chin up. Now put
the belt around her waist.

45
00:03:59,905 --> 00:04:02,366
Bend your arm. Bend your arm.

46
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:04,412
Keep your hands to yourself, thank you.

47
00:04:04,413 --> 00:04:05,623
I beg your pardon?

48
00:04:07,167 --> 00:04:09,254
Sorry. Ready, sir.

49
00:04:10,173 --> 00:04:11,215
Good.

50
00:04:11,216 --> 00:04:13,762
Okay, arm...
Put the quiver on.

51
00:04:15,306 --> 00:04:16,642
Head up, hair back.

52
00:04:18,813 --> 00:04:20,064
Here we go.

53
00:04:20,065 --> 00:04:23,194
Chin up a bit. There.
Now don't move a muscle.

54
00:04:29,582 --> 00:04:30,624
Diana.

55
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:32,169
The Goddess of the hunt.

56
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:36,593
Guardian of the underworld.

57
00:04:38,847 --> 00:04:40,047
Alfonso.

58
00:04:40,893 --> 00:04:43,146
She's got dirt on her arse-cheek.

59
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:48,530
All right. Begin.

60
00:04:56,336 --> 00:05:00,384
Start at the head and finish
at the sole of the foot.

61
00:05:00,385 --> 00:05:02,889
Anatomy has a distinct journey.

62
00:05:27,348 --> 00:05:29,475
Rubbish!

63
00:05:29,476 --> 00:05:32,147
Breasts like flour sacks.

64
00:05:32,148 --> 00:05:34,360
- Begin again. Begin again.
- Give me that.

65
00:05:49,261 --> 00:05:50,461
Thank you.

66
00:06:13,093 --> 00:06:15,388
Something wrong with the merchandise?

67
00:06:15,389 --> 00:06:16,474
What?

68
00:06:16,475 --> 00:06:17,978
Why couldn't you draw me?

69
00:06:19,605 --> 00:06:20,805
Worn...

70
00:06:21,275 --> 00:06:22,317
What?

71
00:06:22,318 --> 00:06:23,695
You look worn.

72
00:06:24,489 --> 00:06:25,908
Uh, spoiled.

73
00:06:26,909 --> 00:06:28,109
Damaged.

74
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:34,797
Tell me, do you find it easy
to pick up women?

75
00:06:34,798 --> 00:06:36,842
Because your routine
needs a lot of work.

76
00:06:36,843 --> 00:06:38,095
You were perfect once.

77
00:06:40,475 --> 00:06:43,604
We are, all of us, born perfect.

78
00:06:43,605 --> 00:06:46,734
But gradually that perfection
is worn away.

79
00:06:46,735 --> 00:06:48,655
It's the hammer blows
that make us works of art.

80
00:06:49,866 --> 00:06:52,286
Do you have any idea
just how strange you are?

81
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:56,251
You've worked...

82
00:06:56,252 --> 00:06:58,129
Most of your life in service.

83
00:06:58,130 --> 00:06:59,298
Excuse me?

84
00:06:59,299 --> 00:07:00,885
You have calluses on your hands.

85
00:07:03,806 --> 00:07:05,268
Candle grease in your hair.

86
00:07:05,935 --> 00:07:07,562
I can see everything.

87
00:07:07,563 --> 00:07:10,442
So, basically you're saying I'm
not pretty enough to sketch?

88
00:07:10,443 --> 00:07:11,820
That is not what I said.

89
00:07:11,821 --> 00:07:14,073
- But that's what you meant.
- No. No, no.

90
00:07:14,074 --> 00:07:15,274
You... You...

91
00:07:18,039 --> 00:07:23,215
You have quality that is
difficult to define, that's all.

92
00:07:23,883 --> 00:07:25,083
Too late.

93
00:07:41,329 --> 00:07:43,875
He's meant to be choosing
a first apprentice soon.

94
00:07:43,876 --> 00:07:46,421
Sorry, boys, but that job
has my name on it.

95
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,177
What's the matter, Leonardo?

96
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:51,554
He didn't finish his Diana.

97
00:07:51,555 --> 00:07:55,103
He's paralyzed again
by his own perfectionism!

98
00:07:56,355 --> 00:07:57,983
You won't get to be
first apprentice that way.

99
00:07:57,984 --> 00:08:01,448
Have you ever noticed how
candlelight differs from sunlight...

100
00:08:02,575 --> 00:08:05,746
In its color and intensity?

101
00:08:05,747 --> 00:08:08,793
Hmm. Incredibly,
I've never given it a thought.

102
00:08:09,838 --> 00:08:11,278
There's more than one kind of light.

103
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,843
Isn't that astonishing?

104
00:08:13,844 --> 00:08:16,348
You wear us all out with your
endless questions, Leonardo.

105
00:08:17,893 --> 00:08:18,977
Drink.

106
00:08:18,978 --> 00:08:21,899
Yes! It's a seven!

107
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,819
I'll take that back,
thank you very much.

108
00:08:48,112 --> 00:08:50,114
- Hey, where's Leonardo?
- Who knows?

109
00:08:50,115 --> 00:08:51,576
He goes wherever he goes.

110
00:09:54,268 --> 00:09:55,468
What are you doing?

111
00:10:02,031 --> 00:10:03,618
How many sketches have you made?

112
00:10:04,995 --> 00:10:06,195
It's not ready yet.

113
00:10:07,248 --> 00:10:08,459
Nothing you ever do is ready.

114
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:09,586
No! No, no!

115
00:10:09,587 --> 00:10:11,213
Leonardo, we're all just students here.

116
00:10:11,214 --> 00:10:12,414
Come on.

117
00:10:20,522 --> 00:10:21,722
Well?

118
00:10:24,904 --> 00:10:26,104
Well...

119
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:33,420
You're going to show this
to Verrocchio?

120
00:10:36,967 --> 00:10:38,637
Well, it isn't
what he asked for, is it?

121
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:41,599
You've not drawn her as Diana,
for a start.

122
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,977
Oh, that ridiculous costume,

123
00:10:43,687 --> 00:10:44,887
those props...

124
00:10:45,857 --> 00:10:48,277
She's so real.

125
00:10:48,278 --> 00:10:51,491
She looks like some...
Some peasant, not a goddess.

126
00:10:51,492 --> 00:10:53,077
We were told to draw what we see.

127
00:10:53,078 --> 00:10:54,789
That is the truth of what I saw.

128
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:57,510
Yes, but that doesn't mean that
anyone else wants to see it, does it?

129
00:11:06,894 --> 00:11:09,397
I'm sorry.

130
00:11:09,398 --> 00:11:11,777
I don't want you to lose your
position here, that's all.

131
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:01,019
Hmm.

132
00:12:08,793 --> 00:12:11,922
Tell me, does your mother love you?

133
00:12:11,923 --> 00:12:14,594
Yes. I suppose so, yes.

134
00:12:15,471 --> 00:12:17,683
Good. Because I don't.

135
00:12:18,726 --> 00:12:21,856
Apes throwing shit have more talent!

136
00:12:21,857 --> 00:12:23,442
Get out of my studio.

137
00:12:23,443 --> 00:12:24,695
Go! Go!

138
00:12:30,706 --> 00:12:31,906
Open it.

139
00:12:37,634 --> 00:12:38,927
Hmm.

140
00:12:38,928 --> 00:12:40,346
Good lines.

141
00:12:40,347 --> 00:12:42,016
Good form.

142
00:12:42,017 --> 00:12:43,309
Thank you.

143
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:46,148
But... It lacks heart.

144
00:12:46,149 --> 00:12:47,192
Sorry, sir?

145
00:12:47,193 --> 00:12:50,656
You've drawn only what you saw.

146
00:12:50,657 --> 00:12:53,911
You must learn to draw what you feel.

147
00:12:53,912 --> 00:12:55,330
Think about it.

148
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:00,580
Give me that.

149
00:13:11,234 --> 00:13:12,434
Are you mocking me?

150
00:13:12,653 --> 00:13:14,573
No, Maestro.

151
00:13:15,407 --> 00:13:16,607
Where is it?

152
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:18,820
I, um...

153
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:30,391
I couldn't find the inspiration.

154
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:35,108
Perhaps you'd find it more
quickly if your belly was empty

155
00:13:35,109 --> 00:13:38,239
and you were sleeping in the gutter.

156
00:13:54,684 --> 00:13:57,188
I want everything, bring it back
over here, and as fast as you can.

157
00:13:57,189 --> 00:13:59,191
You two, I want cleaning
there, and when I say clean,

158
00:13:59,192 --> 00:14:01,236
I mean spotless clean, like
eat-your-dinner-off-it clean.

159
00:14:01,237 --> 00:14:02,697
- Okay, go.
- Sir?

160
00:14:02,698 --> 00:14:03,741
Oh, God...

161
00:14:03,742 --> 00:14:05,368
Hello. Sorry... Sir?

162
00:14:05,369 --> 00:14:08,624
- I've already told you.
- But you must have more work.

163
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:11,337
- You did your job and you were discharged.
- Please.

164
00:14:11,338 --> 00:14:13,424
I can pose as anything.

165
00:14:13,425 --> 00:14:15,469
A Roman princess, the Virgin Mary,

166
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:17,515
the Queen of Sheba, anything, please.

167
00:14:18,642 --> 00:14:19,685
Sorry.

168
00:14:19,686 --> 00:14:21,563
You're not wanted.

169
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:28,909
You!

170
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,662
This is your fault!

171
00:14:30,663 --> 00:14:33,375
They don't want me anymore because
you told them I looked damaged.

172
00:14:33,376 --> 00:14:34,585
- What?
- Of course.

173
00:14:34,586 --> 00:14:38,049
No! No, no! I... I can't
stop thinking about you.

174
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:39,886
I still want to draw you. I...

175
00:14:39,887 --> 00:14:42,057
Look, I...
I want to begin again.

176
00:14:42,058 --> 00:14:44,186
Um... I... I can pay you.

177
00:14:54,705 --> 00:14:56,375
Vieni con me...

178
00:15:06,225 --> 00:15:08,311
So, you live here?

179
00:15:08,312 --> 00:15:09,938
No, it's temporary.

180
00:15:09,939 --> 00:15:12,152
Until they finish the marble
floors in my new villa.

181
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:15,448
Oh.

182
00:15:15,449 --> 00:15:17,578
Humor's just something that
other people do, isn't it?

183
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:19,279
What?

184
00:15:19,581 --> 00:15:20,781
Come on in.

185
00:15:28,305 --> 00:15:29,807
- Ah...
- All right.

186
00:15:31,435 --> 00:15:32,895
Let's see your money.

187
00:15:32,896 --> 00:15:34,148
Ah, yes.

188
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:38,603
For you.

189
00:15:39,866 --> 00:15:41,369
Private sessions cost more.

190
00:15:47,629 --> 00:15:48,840
Thank you.

191
00:15:54,558 --> 00:15:57,354
Now, this is a contractual arrangement.

192
00:15:57,355 --> 00:16:00,525
An artist paying for a model.
Nothing more.

193
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:01,726
No.

194
00:16:16,596 --> 00:16:17,796
Ready.

195
00:16:24,485 --> 00:16:25,685
What is your name?

196
00:16:27,365 --> 00:16:29,494
Caterina. From Cremona.

197
00:16:30,036 --> 00:16:31,747
Cremona.

198
00:16:31,748 --> 00:16:32,948
I'm Leonardo.

199
00:16:33,835 --> 00:16:35,086
From Vinci.

200
00:16:40,805 --> 00:16:42,057
You're very beautiful.

201
00:16:43,726 --> 00:16:45,854
In spite of how you suffer.

202
00:16:45,855 --> 00:16:48,359
Or... Or perhaps
because of it.

203
00:16:50,446 --> 00:16:52,031
Do you always sound so strange,

204
00:16:52,032 --> 00:16:53,592
or is it something you need to work at?

205
00:16:54,412 --> 00:16:55,612
Hmm?

206
00:16:56,708 --> 00:17:00,421
So, I... I don't draw
like the others do.

207
00:17:00,422 --> 00:17:01,902
You don't talk much like them either.

208
00:17:02,425 --> 00:17:04,303
No. No.

209
00:17:04,304 --> 00:17:07,934
Uh... They draw what they
want the world to see.

210
00:17:07,935 --> 00:17:10,271
An ideal. I don't draw that.

211
00:17:10,272 --> 00:17:12,400
I draw what I see.

212
00:17:12,401 --> 00:17:15,197
I believe that nature
is the greatest artwork.

213
00:17:15,198 --> 00:17:18,118
The only perfect act of creation,

214
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:21,667
like the flight of birds

215
00:17:21,668 --> 00:17:23,670
or the meandering pattern of rivers

216
00:17:23,671 --> 00:17:28,054
or the stories in the faces
of the people we meet.

217
00:17:29,932 --> 00:17:31,517
That's what I want to reproduce.

218
00:17:31,518 --> 00:17:34,481
Not some hollow imitation.

219
00:17:35,191 --> 00:17:36,391
So...

220
00:17:37,945 --> 00:17:40,449
So, how do you want me?

221
00:17:44,122 --> 00:17:45,417
Sit as you would normally.

222
00:18:02,404 --> 00:18:03,573
The sheet, would you mind

223
00:18:03,574 --> 00:18:04,814
lowering it from your shoulder?

224
00:18:08,122 --> 00:18:09,707
Like this?

225
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:11,085
Yes.

226
00:18:11,086 --> 00:18:13,172
But just put your hair there...

227
00:18:13,173 --> 00:18:15,427
- Sorry, what are you doing?
- Sorry.

228
00:18:18,557 --> 00:18:21,604
I just... I don't want
my scar in the drawing.

229
00:18:24,777 --> 00:18:26,780
I don't want you telling this story.

230
00:18:32,415 --> 00:18:34,209
Your money doesn't buy you everything.

231
00:18:40,595 --> 00:18:42,640
Gather round. Come quickly
now, everybody, please!

232
00:18:42,641 --> 00:18:44,143
Okay, gather round!

233
00:18:45,855 --> 00:18:48,984
Straighten at the back as well,
please. Okay, quietly. It's okay.

234
00:18:48,985 --> 00:18:50,278
Maestro.

235
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:51,479
Gentlemen.

236
00:18:52,324 --> 00:18:53,660
Our new commission.

237
00:18:58,125 --> 00:18:59,325
The Duomo.

238
00:19:00,171 --> 00:19:01,371
Look.

239
00:19:01,674 --> 00:19:03,134
It's incomplete.

240
00:19:04,804 --> 00:19:06,004
What does it need?

241
00:19:07,768 --> 00:19:10,521
It needs a cross at the summit.

242
00:19:10,522 --> 00:19:11,722
This one!

243
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:16,783
Eight feet in diameter,
weighing 18 tons.

244
00:19:17,952 --> 00:19:23,587
To be mounted on top of the cathedral.

245
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:27,468
To God's everlasting glory.

246
00:19:29,764 --> 00:19:31,267
And Verrocchio's.

247
00:19:43,914 --> 00:19:45,164
Leave him alone.

248
00:19:45,165 --> 00:19:48,379
I'm just asking
where he goes every evening.

249
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:51,092
He values his privacy.
Don't you, Leonardo?

250
00:19:51,093 --> 00:19:52,653
You know you can tell us
if it's a girl.

251
00:19:57,353 --> 00:19:59,107
Of course it's a girl, you idiot.

252
00:20:31,788 --> 00:20:34,292
What are you doing?

253
00:20:34,293 --> 00:20:37,255
These are the pigments
I'm going to use to paint you.

254
00:20:37,256 --> 00:20:38,966
Where did you get them?

255
00:20:38,967 --> 00:20:40,677
Don't ask.

256
00:20:40,678 --> 00:20:42,306
So, isn't sketching me enough?

257
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:44,508
Why paint?

258
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,861
Nothing is ever enough.

259
00:21:04,427 --> 00:21:06,223
To achieve the unachievable.

260
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:08,434
That's what brings us...

261
00:21:10,146 --> 00:21:11,522
True glory.

262
00:21:11,523 --> 00:21:12,723
Maestro?

263
00:21:18,368 --> 00:21:19,953
Huh?

264
00:21:19,954 --> 00:21:21,290
Leonardo.

265
00:21:23,085 --> 00:21:25,129
What's troubling you, Maestro?

266
00:21:30,848 --> 00:21:32,059
I confess.

267
00:21:33,269 --> 00:21:36,734
I may have overreached.

268
00:21:43,829 --> 00:21:46,543
The weight of the sphere,
it is too great.

269
00:21:48,504 --> 00:21:53,261
This crane will manage
the first part of the journey.

270
00:21:53,262 --> 00:21:56,642
But raising it from here to the top...

271
00:21:56,643 --> 00:21:58,520
The scaffold will not bear it.

272
00:21:58,521 --> 00:21:59,856
Yes.

273
00:21:59,857 --> 00:22:02,361
When the crane swings around,
it will collapse.

274
00:22:03,404 --> 00:22:06,284
My reputation hangs on this.

275
00:22:19,433 --> 00:22:21,227
Go to bed, Leonardo.
Go to bed.

276
00:22:21,895 --> 00:22:23,106
This is my burden.

277
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:14,810
It's weightless.

278
00:23:17,199 --> 00:23:18,535
It needs to be weightless.

279
00:24:12,962 --> 00:24:14,382
This can't be.

280
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:19,390
So many pulleys reducing the weight.

281
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:01,870
Oh, no...

282
00:25:13,651 --> 00:25:15,362
Come on, engage the gears.

283
00:25:31,056 --> 00:25:32,558
Come on, come on.

284
00:26:26,359 --> 00:26:27,559
Bravo, Maestro!

285
00:26:39,382 --> 00:26:40,758
Where are we going?

286
00:26:40,759 --> 00:26:42,345
My favorite place, I told you.

287
00:26:43,348 --> 00:26:44,548
All right.

288
00:26:46,061 --> 00:26:47,645
- This?
- This is it!

289
00:26:47,646 --> 00:26:48,814
This is your favorite place?

290
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:49,983
This is my favorite place!

291
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:51,611
It's where I come to draw people.

292
00:26:51,612 --> 00:26:53,907
- Where people wash their clothes?
- Yes.

293
00:26:55,619 --> 00:26:57,788
I find it relaxing,
the sound of the water...

294
00:26:57,789 --> 00:26:58,989
- Is that strange?
- Yeah!

295
00:27:12,481 --> 00:27:15,235
Let me show you something else.

296
00:27:15,236 --> 00:27:17,823
When I was a child, I used
to gaze at people all day.

297
00:27:17,824 --> 00:27:19,284
I mean, I would never say anything.

298
00:27:19,285 --> 00:27:21,704
I would just stare at their face.

299
00:27:21,705 --> 00:27:23,917
You still talk like a child,
you know that?

300
00:27:23,918 --> 00:27:25,753
What's that supposed to mean?

301
00:27:25,754 --> 00:27:28,049
Nothing, it...
It's from the heart.

302
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:33,350
Well, when you're a child
everything is magical and wondrous

303
00:27:33,351 --> 00:27:36,438
and we are, by nature, curious.

304
00:27:36,439 --> 00:27:37,639
It... It's like...

305
00:27:39,319 --> 00:27:42,824
Most people would look at that
fountain, and they would just see

306
00:27:42,825 --> 00:27:45,037
water flowing through a channel.

307
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:47,624
And what do you see?

308
00:27:47,625 --> 00:27:51,506
Well, I see that, but there are
thousands of other questions.

309
00:27:51,507 --> 00:27:52,758
"How does the water flow?"

310
00:27:52,759 --> 00:27:54,637
"How does it turn?
How does it tumble?"

311
00:27:54,638 --> 00:27:57,057
"How does it react with
everything else around it?"

312
00:27:57,058 --> 00:28:00,147
There are thousands of
questions that need unraveling.

313
00:28:02,401 --> 00:28:04,403
Do you know what I mean?

314
00:28:04,404 --> 00:28:06,616
I'm trying to.

315
00:28:06,617 --> 00:28:09,203
I could stare at these faces all day.

316
00:28:09,204 --> 00:28:11,959
Hmm. What do you see
when you stare at them?

317
00:28:14,922 --> 00:28:16,122
Stories.

318
00:28:17,719 --> 00:28:21,140
- Each of these people has been on a journey and...
- Hmm.

319
00:28:21,141 --> 00:28:22,852
You can see that in their face.

320
00:28:22,853 --> 00:28:24,413
If you get close enough you can see it.

321
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:35,290
What about this face?

322
00:28:35,291 --> 00:28:37,001
- This face?
- Yes.

323
00:28:38,547 --> 00:28:40,091
She looks...

324
00:28:41,134 --> 00:28:43,346
- She looks strong...
- Yes.

325
00:28:43,347 --> 00:28:45,350
- And determined...
- Like it.

326
00:28:48,314 --> 00:28:49,941
She wants a better life for herself.

327
00:28:51,861 --> 00:28:53,697
But also...

328
00:28:56,328 --> 00:28:57,538
She's been hurt.

329
00:29:00,794 --> 00:29:02,314
And she doesn't want to be hurt again.

330
00:29:13,941 --> 00:29:16,863
All right, um,
what about Leonardo da Vinci?

331
00:29:18,324 --> 00:29:20,285
What's his story?

332
00:29:21,496 --> 00:29:22,696
Oh.

333
00:29:23,291 --> 00:29:24,491
Um...

334
00:29:34,477 --> 00:29:35,686
I have to go to work.

335
00:29:35,687 --> 00:29:37,022
We've only just got here...

336
00:29:37,023 --> 00:29:38,859
Look, I'll... I'll see you
tonight. I promise.

337
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,278
No... Leonardo!

338
00:29:56,348 --> 00:29:58,016
Come, Guglielmo!

339
00:29:58,017 --> 00:30:00,187
Come to me!

340
00:30:00,188 --> 00:30:01,732
Hey!

341
00:30:01,733 --> 00:30:03,944
You want to go to the market with Papa?

342
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:07,190
Papa!

343
00:30:12,041 --> 00:30:15,464
Papa! Papa! Papa!

344
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,460
Papa!

345
00:30:20,974 --> 00:30:22,174
Papa!

346
00:30:23,604 --> 00:30:24,856
Papa!

347
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:32,650
Hello?

348
00:30:34,121 --> 00:30:35,874
I'm sorry I left you earlier.

349
00:30:39,339 --> 00:30:40,539
What is it?

350
00:30:44,348 --> 00:30:45,600
Why are you crying?

351
00:30:55,617 --> 00:30:58,162
You weren't meant to look.
It isn't finished.

352
00:30:58,163 --> 00:31:00,917
I asked you, I begged you...

353
00:31:00,918 --> 00:31:02,712
I begged you not to paint this!

354
00:31:02,713 --> 00:31:05,968
I can't close my eyes. I
need to draw what I see! I...

355
00:31:05,969 --> 00:31:07,889
You need to...
Can't you understand?

356
00:31:09,558 --> 00:31:12,689
Something very bad happened
to me. I don't want to remember!

357
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:20,650
I thought...

358
00:31:22,873 --> 00:31:26,419
That we were friends,
but you have no feelings.

359
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:27,620
You're...

360
00:31:29,343 --> 00:31:31,054
You're just so selfish!

361
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:33,850
You only care about your art.

362
00:31:37,773 --> 00:31:39,568
You keep the painting then,
I don't care.

363
00:31:39,569 --> 00:31:41,403
- Oh, don't be stupid now!
- No, no, destroy it if you want.

364
00:31:41,404 --> 00:31:43,032
- It's yours! You painted it! I just...
- I don't care!

365
00:31:43,033 --> 00:31:44,659
I'll find another model to paint!

366
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:46,203
There are hundreds of models
in Florence!

367
00:31:46,204 --> 00:31:47,707
All right then.
Just go.

368
00:32:18,929 --> 00:32:20,129
Give me the bag.

369
00:32:23,729 --> 00:32:24,929
Hmm.

370
00:32:26,316 --> 00:32:27,735
Gifts from your father?

371
00:32:29,237 --> 00:32:30,448
No, Maestro.

372
00:32:32,702 --> 00:32:33,902
Then...

373
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:38,044
You admit you stole them from me.

374
00:32:43,179 --> 00:32:48,645
Do you have anything to say for
yourself before I dismiss you?

375
00:32:51,819 --> 00:32:53,579
I wanted to paint something
that was perfect.

376
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:58,413
I want you out of here.

377
00:33:02,253 --> 00:33:03,453
Go!

378
00:33:11,895 --> 00:33:13,095
Thank you.

379
00:33:46,371 --> 00:33:47,873
Buongiorno.
Buongiorno.

380
00:33:57,849 --> 00:33:59,685
I told you before,
there's no work for you here.

381
00:33:59,686 --> 00:34:00,728
Please leave.

382
00:34:00,729 --> 00:34:02,608
I need to see Leonardo da Vinci.

383
00:34:03,609 --> 00:34:05,111
He's not here.

384
00:34:05,112 --> 00:34:06,905
- Where is he?
- Gone.

385
00:34:06,906 --> 00:34:09,076
What do you mean "gone"?

386
00:34:09,077 --> 00:34:10,912
This studio doesn't employ thieves.

387
00:34:10,913 --> 00:34:12,165
- Now, please leave.
- Thieves?

388
00:34:12,166 --> 00:34:14,085
I need to speak to your master.

389
00:34:14,086 --> 00:34:17,507
You'll leave right now, or I'll have
the bailiff march you to the Bargello.

390
00:34:17,508 --> 00:34:19,552
Hey, hey! No, no! Stop!
You're not welcome here!

391
00:34:19,553 --> 00:34:22,892
- Maestro! I tried to stop her!
- She barged her way in!

392
00:34:22,893 --> 00:34:24,395
I need to show you something.

393
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:27,858
It's all right, Alfonso.
Go. Go.

394
00:34:27,859 --> 00:34:29,059
You need to see this.

395
00:34:30,698 --> 00:34:31,898
So?

396
00:34:45,515 --> 00:34:46,715
Ah...

397
00:34:47,602 --> 00:34:48,812
Leonardo's?

398
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:52,818
I know where he might be.

399
00:35:07,971 --> 00:35:09,171
Maestro.

400
00:35:10,725 --> 00:35:13,105
You've been hiding a secret from me.

401
00:35:14,315 --> 00:35:15,515
Maestro?

402
00:35:17,612 --> 00:35:20,784
The sketches to raise
the lantern on the Duomo,

403
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:21,985
they were yours.

404
00:35:24,749 --> 00:35:25,949
Yes, they were.

405
00:35:30,885 --> 00:35:32,428
Return with me.

406
00:35:32,429 --> 00:35:34,767
You will be my first apprentice.

407
00:35:42,906 --> 00:35:45,368
We've just received a commission.

408
00:35:45,369 --> 00:35:47,748
An altarpiece
for the Church of Saint-Salvi.

409
00:35:48,833 --> 00:35:50,586
The Baptism of Christ.

410
00:35:51,713 --> 00:35:53,090
Look.

411
00:35:53,091 --> 00:35:57,723
Jesus, John, and the angels.

412
00:35:58,809 --> 00:36:00,395
You will paint alongside me.

413
00:36:02,648 --> 00:36:05,236
Yes, but...
But why me, Maestro?

414
00:36:06,029 --> 00:36:08,032
Because...

415
00:36:08,033 --> 00:36:10,078
Because you have the gift of an angel.

416
00:36:31,448 --> 00:36:32,825
Can I speak with you, please?

417
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:36,624
Something's happened?

418
00:36:37,542 --> 00:36:38,627
You look happy.

419
00:36:38,628 --> 00:36:40,214
Yes. Yes, I am.

420
00:36:41,549 --> 00:36:42,749
Thanks to you.

421
00:36:44,095 --> 00:36:46,807
First apprentice.

422
00:36:46,808 --> 00:36:53,027
Um... Look, I... I came by
to say that I'm sorry

423
00:36:53,028 --> 00:36:56,574
for what I said and...
And for the way I behaved.

424
00:36:56,575 --> 00:36:58,203
But also to say thank you.

425
00:37:02,461 --> 00:37:06,718
All my life, I...
I have felt like nothing.

426
00:37:08,888 --> 00:37:10,088
Until now.

427
00:37:11,184 --> 00:37:14,398
And until you, so...

428
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:18,237
Um...

429
00:37:18,238 --> 00:37:20,617
Can we go and celebrate
or something, please?

430
00:37:21,911 --> 00:37:23,664
- Come on, let's go! Yeah...
- Yeah!

431
00:37:28,338 --> 00:37:29,381
Uh...

432
00:37:29,382 --> 00:37:30,968
To the first apprentice.

433
00:37:31,970 --> 00:37:33,305
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

434
00:37:37,479 --> 00:37:38,679
Hey...

435
00:37:40,401 --> 00:37:41,601
One day...

436
00:37:42,655 --> 00:37:44,032
You will own this town.

437
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:46,860
It's true.

438
00:37:53,758 --> 00:37:55,594
What?

439
00:37:58,307 --> 00:37:59,768
This is where you kiss me.

440
00:38:01,855 --> 00:38:03,524
- Really?
- Really.

441
00:38:08,617 --> 00:38:10,177
What kind of kiss did you have in mind?

442
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:14,334
I was...

443
00:38:14,335 --> 00:38:17,006
Thinking our lips could touch
in a passionate way.

444
00:38:18,175 --> 00:38:19,886
- A regular kiss, then?
- Yes.

445
00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:23,090
Fine.

446
00:38:37,667 --> 00:38:38,867
Well...

447
00:38:57,827 --> 00:38:59,246
No, wait. Wait.

448
00:39:00,707 --> 00:39:02,001
I'm sorry, I can't.

449
00:39:03,754 --> 00:39:04,796
What?

450
00:39:04,797 --> 00:39:06,591
- I'm sorry, no.
- What?

451
00:39:07,385 --> 00:39:08,585
I don't want this.

452
00:39:09,263 --> 00:39:10,463
It's...

453
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:15,732
It's because I'm...
I'm damaged?

454
00:39:15,733 --> 00:39:16,933
You...

455
00:39:18,278 --> 00:39:20,031
You think if you seduce me, then...

456
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:23,913
Then you can be my mistress,

457
00:39:23,914 --> 00:39:25,332
and that's why you're doing this.

458
00:39:25,333 --> 00:39:26,583
- Your mistress?
- Yes.

459
00:39:26,584 --> 00:39:28,587
- What are you talking about?
- You think that

460
00:39:28,588 --> 00:39:30,883
if you seduce me, then I
can take you out of here.

461
00:39:30,884 --> 00:39:32,928
- No, what? What are you talking about?
- Out of this hovel.

462
00:39:32,929 --> 00:39:34,890
That's what... You... You showed
my painting to the Maestro...

463
00:39:34,891 --> 00:39:36,476
To help you.

464
00:39:36,477 --> 00:39:38,521
- No, to help yourself, that's why you did it!
- What? Why...

465
00:39:38,522 --> 00:39:40,900
Is that really what you think of me?

466
00:39:40,901 --> 00:39:42,487
That I'm just a whore?

467
00:39:44,198 --> 00:39:45,398
No.

468
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:47,329
What's wrong with you?

469
00:39:48,497 --> 00:39:49,790
Just go!

470
00:39:53,006 --> 00:39:54,206
- I'm sorry.
- Get out!

471
00:39:59,016 --> 00:40:00,560
And don't ever come back!

472
00:40:35,413 --> 00:40:37,583
First lesson.

473
00:40:38,751 --> 00:40:40,753
Come.

474
00:40:40,754 --> 00:40:42,674
There are three kinds of light.

475
00:40:43,801 --> 00:40:47,140
The first is direct light.

476
00:40:47,141 --> 00:40:50,479
From a window or a candle flame.

477
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,689
Hmm.

478
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:52,943
The second...

479
00:40:58,661 --> 00:41:00,747
Is diffused light.

480
00:41:05,047 --> 00:41:10,889
You see how... How the darkness
creates volume and depth?

481
00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:12,893
The darkness highlights
as much as the light.

482
00:41:12,894 --> 00:41:14,094
Yes.

483
00:41:14,772 --> 00:41:17,318
Dark against light.

484
00:41:18,696 --> 00:41:21,658
And light against dark.

485
00:41:21,659 --> 00:41:22,952
Chiaroscuro.

486
00:41:22,953 --> 00:41:24,162
Mmm.

487
00:41:24,163 --> 00:41:27,376
There are no solid lines in nature,

488
00:41:27,377 --> 00:41:31,300
but that's not how
the human eye perceives them.

489
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:34,555
We paint the truth.

490
00:41:34,556 --> 00:41:36,601
- A transition from the light...
- Hmm.

491
00:41:37,896 --> 00:41:39,648
Into the dark.

492
00:41:39,649 --> 00:41:41,193
What's the third kind of light?

493
00:41:43,154 --> 00:41:44,781
You'll see.

494
00:41:44,782 --> 00:41:45,982
Follow me.

495
00:41:51,544 --> 00:41:53,547
The third kind of light.

496
00:41:55,634 --> 00:42:01,060
All my life, I've sought to
capture the soft beauty of this.

497
00:42:03,314 --> 00:42:04,440
But alas,

498
00:42:04,441 --> 00:42:06,194
it is beyond me.

499
00:42:11,495 --> 00:42:13,164
Come.

500
00:42:13,165 --> 00:42:15,334
Let's get to work.

501
00:42:15,335 --> 00:42:18,799
We have to make a proper
artist of this dreamer.

502
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:23,181
Second lesson.

503
00:42:23,182 --> 00:42:24,893
The birth of color.

504
00:42:30,194 --> 00:42:31,822
It's olive green.

505
00:42:42,966 --> 00:42:45,762
You see how the
composition is balanced.

506
00:42:45,763 --> 00:42:47,055
Yes, Maestro.

507
00:42:47,056 --> 00:42:48,309
Hold it there.

508
00:42:50,605 --> 00:42:51,805
Very soft...

509
00:42:54,027 --> 00:42:56,322
I will paint the angel in blue

510
00:42:56,323 --> 00:42:58,742
and you will paint the other one.

511
00:42:58,743 --> 00:43:01,707
Don't worry. Make mistakes.

512
00:43:12,059 --> 00:43:13,259
So...

513
00:43:13,978 --> 00:43:15,189
The famous model.

514
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:22,493
So, how is he?

515
00:43:24,162 --> 00:43:25,915
Busy.

516
00:43:25,916 --> 00:43:27,116
A commission.

517
00:43:28,002 --> 00:43:29,712
He and Verrocchio work night and day.

518
00:43:29,713 --> 00:43:31,925
- Oh, good. Hmm.
- Hmm.

519
00:43:31,926 --> 00:43:33,429
I'm happy for him.

520
00:43:35,223 --> 00:43:37,101
He deserves the success.

521
00:43:37,102 --> 00:43:39,021
Mmm-hmm.

522
00:43:39,022 --> 00:43:40,983
Now say that in a way
that sounds convincing.

523
00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:46,409
He doesn't come to see you anymore?

524
00:43:50,458 --> 00:43:51,658
I was...

525
00:43:52,837 --> 00:43:54,839
Stupid.

526
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:58,888
I misinterpreted what was
going on between us, so...

527
00:43:58,889 --> 00:44:00,266
You're saying he rejected you?

528
00:44:03,606 --> 00:44:05,317
A beautiful woman like yourself?

529
00:44:07,738 --> 00:44:08,938
He's an idiot.

530
00:46:21,595 --> 00:46:23,347
So...

531
00:46:23,348 --> 00:46:26,812
The falcon has taught the falconer.

532
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:47,681
- Buona sera.
- Grazie.

533
00:47:03,542 --> 00:47:05,128
Leonardo. How are you feeling?

534
00:47:06,130 --> 00:47:07,340
Nervous.

535
00:47:07,341 --> 00:47:08,800
- This is your moment.
- Oh...

536
00:47:08,801 --> 00:47:10,804
They're all here for you.

537
00:47:10,805 --> 00:47:12,348
- Let's go.
- Come on.

538
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:31,339
Be happy, Leonardo.

539
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:35,974
An artist's first triumph
is a moment he never forgets.

540
00:47:36,474 --> 00:47:37,674
Yes, Maestro.

541
00:47:39,145 --> 00:47:41,023
- The cardinal...
- Bravo, Leonardo.

542
00:47:41,024 --> 00:47:42,224
Oh...

543
00:47:42,944 --> 00:47:44,144
We finally finished.

544
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:46,532
Bravo.

545
00:47:46,533 --> 00:47:48,327
- Complimenti.
- Thank you.

546
00:47:56,551 --> 00:47:58,930
Remarkable. Isn't it?

547
00:48:04,439 --> 00:48:07,486
I believe Verrocchio painted
the angel on the right.

548
00:48:08,488 --> 00:48:10,031
But I'm told

549
00:48:10,032 --> 00:48:13,037
the other one was done
by his first apprentice.

550
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:15,740
Yes.

551
00:48:20,467 --> 00:48:22,930
Left-handed strokes,
if I'm not mistaken.

552
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:27,260
I have an eye.

553
00:48:32,821 --> 00:48:34,657
You're left-handed.

554
00:48:34,658 --> 00:48:37,872
- I'm the... The first apprentice.
- Ah.

555
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:45,677
Then perhaps there is more than
one narrative in this painting.

556
00:48:47,638 --> 00:48:50,977
John is anointing Jesus.

557
00:48:50,978 --> 00:48:55,778
And Verrocchio is anointing
you as his successor.

558
00:48:58,241 --> 00:48:59,994
You are Leonardo?

559
00:49:03,458 --> 00:49:04,710
Do you know who I am?

560
00:49:06,087 --> 00:49:07,130
Yes, Your Grace.

561
00:49:07,131 --> 00:49:08,717
Ludovico Sforza.

562
00:49:09,844 --> 00:49:12,139
Come and paint for me in Milan.

563
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:15,311
I'll double your salary
and give you your own studio.

564
00:49:19,778 --> 00:49:20,862
I couldn't possibly.

565
00:49:20,863 --> 00:49:22,991
I... I have just accepted
a position here.

566
00:49:25,538 --> 00:49:26,738
But thank you, Your Grace.

567
00:49:28,835 --> 00:49:31,381
I never offer twice
what has been refused once.

568
00:49:34,428 --> 00:49:35,628
Pity.

569
00:49:39,854 --> 00:49:41,189
See who that is?

570
00:49:41,190 --> 00:49:43,359
That's Sforza, Duke of Milan.

571
00:49:57,468 --> 00:49:58,668
Congratulations.

572
00:50:01,850 --> 00:50:03,269
You're here?

573
00:50:03,270 --> 00:50:06,108
Another penetrating
observation from the artist.

574
00:50:14,581 --> 00:50:17,627
First time we spoke,
we were standing right here.

575
00:50:17,628 --> 00:50:19,589
And I insulted you.

576
00:50:19,590 --> 00:50:21,801
We insulted each other.

577
00:50:21,802 --> 00:50:23,002
Happy memories.

578
00:50:25,558 --> 00:50:26,758
Yes, um...

579
00:50:34,616 --> 00:50:35,909
I, uh...

580
00:50:35,910 --> 00:50:37,110
Caterina?

581
00:50:38,456 --> 00:50:39,656
Congratulations.

582
00:50:42,212 --> 00:50:43,412
- Come.
- Yes.

583
00:50:56,570 --> 00:50:58,823
If that's true,
then why did you kill her?

584
00:50:58,824 --> 00:51:00,034
I didn't.

585
00:51:02,205 --> 00:51:03,405
I couldn't.

586
00:51:04,876 --> 00:51:06,044
There are witnesses.

587
00:51:06,045 --> 00:51:07,506
We know you're skilled in alchemy.

588
00:51:14,518 --> 00:51:15,729
If you're innocent,

589
00:51:17,106 --> 00:51:18,306
where's your proof?

590
00:51:24,118 --> 00:51:25,954
Say something to convince me.

591
00:51:29,962 --> 00:51:31,162
I can't.

592
00:51:37,099 --> 00:51:38,225
Well?

593
00:51:38,226 --> 00:51:40,103
He hasn't confessed.

594
00:51:40,104 --> 00:51:41,689
But he was caught red-handed.

595
00:51:41,690 --> 00:51:43,609
That's what bothers me.

596
00:51:43,610 --> 00:51:46,948
We're talking about the
greatest artist of his generation.

597
00:51:46,949 --> 00:51:49,953
How could he be stupid enough to
kill her in such an obvious way?

598
00:51:49,954 --> 00:51:51,789
I have no idea.

599
00:51:51,790 --> 00:51:54,419
But you'd better find out, and quick.

600
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:56,048
What are you talking about?

601
00:51:56,049 --> 00:51:59,261
You want your promotion, don't you?

602
00:51:59,262 --> 00:52:01,182
It has already been promised.

603
00:52:02,852 --> 00:52:05,481
Stefano...

604
00:52:05,482 --> 00:52:09,362
You can't expect the French
governor to keep his promise.

605
00:52:09,363 --> 00:52:12,702
Not if you embarrass him by
failing to get Leonardo to confess.

606
00:52:16,250 --> 00:52:17,502
Where are you going?

607
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:21,175
To make sure Leonardo hangs.

607
00:52:22,305 --> 00:53:22,432
