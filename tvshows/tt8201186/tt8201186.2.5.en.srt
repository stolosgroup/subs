Ms Bello claims the affair
happened four years ago,

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,159
while the MP was visiting Nigeria.

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,679
Those are the guys
I saw getting into the grey van.

4
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:11,319
To tell you the truth, I'd rather
avoid this place altogether.

5
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:14,319
Not easy when half your clients
are in the same building.

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,119
Actually, Mr Knox,
I came to ask for your help.

7
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,799
I see.

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,159
The mask.

Gemma, Operation Vanguard is
compromised.

11
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,919
The seventh floor is down.

12
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,559
Vanguard needs a new home.

13
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,879
You accuse me of sabotage, and...

14
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,479
...and now you want my help.

15
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,919
China's going to lose the facial-rec
bid. The US are waiting in line.

16
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,439
We carry the same burdens.
Guilt and regret.

17
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,279
If you want to give yourself
the best chance,

18
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,559
you'll free yourself of them.

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,679
we speak to Victoria Bello
from her home in Lagos.

21
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,399
This isn't about facial rec -
this is about me.

22
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,719
I beg your pardon, Mr Turner?
I said, I hope you're proud,

23
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,399
forcing my family away
from their home.

24
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,839
He looks like you.

25
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,279
What? Victoria Bello's son, Amandi.

26
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,119

00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,520
Free Shaun? As in Shaun Emery?

29
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,319
Your paternity test has come back
negative - you must be delighted.

30
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,599
Why do you think she made those
claims? I understand.

31
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,119
Some people will go to desperate
lengths to jump the queue.

32
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,879
Mr Knox, do we have a match?

33
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,319

this was going to happen.

66
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,359

68
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,159
It's probably why they asked me
to get you.

People look at me and think I can
handle myself, but the truth is

I am a bloody coward.

00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,399
Good question.

147
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,599
What do you expect?
I've always been Team Zac.

148
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,279
To be fair, that is true. Even when
I was fired, you answered my calls.

149
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:11,359
I tried you - it wouldn't go
through. Yeah. Fucking Vodafone.

150
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,679
But then again,
maybe it was just a decoy

151
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,439

you to do, which was to dig up

00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,199
Victoria Bello's paperwork
and check for concerns.

153

would just... go away.

to be doing you any harm.

157
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,319
Aliza, there's going to be
an inquiry

158
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,239
and none of us are safe.
If the Home Secretary himself had

159

a hand in obstructing
Bello's application,

160

it's going to come out.

00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,000
Aliza, you need to share it.

162
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,239
I've been calling you all day.

163
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,839
I-I-I've been in Salford, so...

164
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,159
I saw you.

165
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,279
BBC Breakfast.

166
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,919
I assume that was you?

167
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,799
Yes. So, look, I'm just on my way
to see the Home Secretary, so...

168
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,600
On your way to becoming Home Sec,
according to Twitter.

169
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,520
I need to speak to you.

170
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,000
Gregory Knox came through.
The unmasking.

171
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,799
We have a name. Nikolai Mirsky.

172
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,879
Russian ex-military.

173
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,319
I know. We need to get this to SO15.

174
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,080
Except I can't explain how I came by
it, so I suggest it comes from you.

175
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,999
Me? At the time of the attack,
you were Security Minister.

176
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,199
You had clearance
to any number of operations.

177
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,199
All you need to do is say
you can't reveal the source.

178
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,959
I-I-I don't know.

179
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,840
It sounds a bit like faking evidence
to me.

180
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,879
What?

181
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,839
You've taken the footage,
manipulated it,

182
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,799
now you want to hide where it
came from.

183
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,479
For use as intelligence,
not evidence.

184
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,399
HE SCOFFS
Now you sound like a true believer.

185
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,839
This is a visual on
a Russian state-sanctioned killer.

186
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,959
We need to act.
We're the only ones that have it.

187
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,719
ISAAC SIGHS

188
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,319
Look, I know we have other battles.

189
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:34,039
But we can't expose Correction
while we're under attack by

190
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:37,000
a foreign power.
We need to win this one first.

191
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,600
Khadija heard your recording.

192
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,479
The Home Secretary
discussing Correction.

193
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,759
You mean Khadija Khan,
who interviewed Victoria Bello

194
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,119
and claimed the Home Office
obstructed her application?

195
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,960
Isaac, the deal is still intact.

196
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,520
What deal?

197
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,800
Somebody got to you.

198
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,679
Didn't they? I don't know
what you're talking about.

199
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,279
Jesus Christ! I'm not recording!

200
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:30,239
I'm sorry, Detective, but I think
I've given you enough of my time.

201
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,840
You can talk to me, Isaac. You can
trust me. Don't lie to me!

202
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,240
You really think
I need to take this shit from you?

203
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:47,519
You know how I know it was
you... on BBC Breakfast

204
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,920
and not your deep-fake?

205
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,720
You touched your cross.

206
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,879
You run your thumb over the cross on
your neck chain when you're anxious.

207
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,560
No, I don't.
It's my job to notice things.

208
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:06,560
Your deep-fake's never done that.
Only you.

209
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,320
You're all right, Isaac.

210
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:18,639
Not that kind of politician,
like you said.

211
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,279
Whatever's happened,

212
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:23,120
whatever they've threatened you
with, I can help you.

213
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,160
We can get through this.

214
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,120
Who was it?! Who got to you?!

215
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,600
Garland? The Home Secretary? Who?

216
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,599
You have a case to solve.
I have a job to do.

217
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,480
Other battles, like you said.

218
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,280
So why don't we just get on with
it and go our separate ways?

219
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,400
PHONE VIBRATES

220
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:18,159
Carey. Ma'am. I thought you'd
like to know, comms are back up.

221
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,039
We're rolling out new units
to all ops.

222
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,999
What about the camera network?

223
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,359
Secure. Vanguard has a new base.

224
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,439
Or I could bring the comms to you?

225
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,640
That is... if you're back at work?

226
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:36,279
Meet me in an hour.
Where do you want me, ma'am?

227
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:39,720
Broadcasting House,
three o'clock, sharp. Yes, ma'am.

228
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,159
Thanks to the intervention
of our US partners,

229
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,600
Operation Vanguard is now secure.

230
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,999
Vladimir Putin himself
couldn't compromise it.

231
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,519
CHUCKLING

232
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:01,279
Although this remains
a UK counter terrorism operation,

233
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:05,199
inside this building
you are in US territory,

234
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,959
and you will operate in accordance
with US laws,

235
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:11,239
regulations,
and standard operating procedures.

236
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,599
Our hosts will be on hand at
all times

237
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,760
to support us through
any, uh, cultural differences.

238
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,959
Connor here will be leading a
support team

239
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,839
of technical operatives, alongside
someone many of you will be

240
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:26,199
acquainted with already,
our very own DI Phillips,

241
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,519
who's been on secondment here
for the past six months,

242
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,199
and I'm pleased to say
hasn't picked up the accent.

243
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,199
CHUCKLING

244
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,599
Um, I know you're all
still reeling from

245
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:42,119
the tragic loss
of Detective Sergeant Patrick Flynn,

246
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,839
Specialist Firearms Officer
Jason McKenna

247
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,200
and Specialist Firearms Officer
Lee Bradbury.

248
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:53,280
But the way to... hon our
our fallen colleagues...

249
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,800
...is to catch the scum
that took their lives.

250
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,480
Thank you, sir.

251
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,119
As Commander Hart said...

252
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:09,279
Is he going to maintain
his stiff upper lip?

253
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,160
I think I see it quivering.

254
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,079
...with a much wider range

255
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,359
of intelligence-gathering tools
at our disposal.

256
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,759
Now, given the urgency,

257
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,679
we've begun analysing existing data
from the operation,

258
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,920
and we've uncovered
a few truffles already.

259
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,800
Danny? Sir?

260
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,160
A long time since
you called me that.

261
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,240
I just wanted to say thank you.

262
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,479
That was the team talk
we all needed.

263
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,600
It's the last one
you'll hear me give.

264
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,519
I stopped by the Commissioner's
office this morning.

265
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:51,319
Handed in my 7-28.
You're resigning?

266
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,240
After Vanguard, I'm out.

267
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,879
Don't worry, Gemma.

268
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,960
I didn't give the real reason.

269
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,959
I'm in the middle of a meeting.
I've got about two minutes.

270
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,839
Did you have to interview her?

271
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,119
I beg your pardon?

272
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,799
Victoria Bello.
Was that really necessary?

273
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,719
SHE SCOFFS Last time I checked,

274
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,399
I'm not required
to justify my editorial choices

275
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,399
to the authorities. We're not living
in a police state yet.

276
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,559
Well, I hope it was worth it. Cos
Isaac Turner is now out of the deal.

277
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,439
What, because of that? Oh, please.

278
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:38,319
You do not understand. I understand
perfectly. I will call Zac myself,

279
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,319
show the requisite humility.

280
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,039
It's a dance.
You'd do well to learn the steps.

281
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,439
Learn this!
I was with Isaac Turner an hour ago.

282
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,119
He wouldn't even admit we had a
deal! He doesn't trust us,

283
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,519
and that is your fault.
Lower your tone.

284
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,239
I don't let anyone raise their voice
at me off camera.

285
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,879
I am not anyone!
You have fucked it up, Khadija.

286
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,360
For all of us!

287
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,239
I thought we said three o'clock?

288
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,200
I'd rather be early - always.

289
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,160
How much did you hear?

290
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,680
Nothing.

291
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,959
I brought your comms.

292
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,040
And I thought you'd
want to know there's a new lead.

293
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,360
Take me to the new base.
I'll follow.

294
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,879
After the presentation,

295
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,719
the Home Secretary will make
what he promises will be

296
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,399
a short announcement,

297
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,719
and the Security Minister will take
questions from the press.

298
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,280
APPLAUSE

299
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,919
Britain's border security
will soon be bolstered

300
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,439
by a digital layer of protection,

301
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,119
provided by a company
who count among their clients

302
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,639
the US Pentagon.

303
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,199
All of us who value the security

304
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,759
and sovereignty of our nation

305
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:04,519
will value the support
of Clear Horizons AI. Thank you.

306
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,239
Care to make a statement about
Victoria Bello? Have you spoken

307
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,439
to Isaac Turner today, Home
Secretary? Did anyone

308
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,639
at the Home Office obstruct

309
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,280
Victoria Bello's application,
Home Secretary? Thank you.

310
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,199
This is where the magic happens.

311
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,599
Tom. What have I missed?
Lots, by the looks of things.

312
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,799
Well, that's what comes of skipping
the briefings.

313
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,799
We can't hold the class up
just for you, Carey.

314
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,679
I've been on compassionate leave,
so...

315
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,079
...be compassionate.

316
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,880
No time for compassion.
Not in the middle of a manhunt.

317
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,679
Who's the target?

318
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:15,000
A Russian National. Nikolai Mirsky.

319
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,879
We've got every facial-rec system
in the UK looking for him

320
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,360
and every ANPR looking
for his van.

321
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:28,119
Do we, um, do we know the source?

322
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,399
I mean, how did he get on our
radar?

323
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,120
You think they'd tell me?

324
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,039
How are you feeling, Rachel?

325
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,439
Ma'am. Just getting up to speed.

326
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,959
I appreciate you coming back
to work so soon,

327
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,759
after the experience you've had.

328
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,799
I'd rather... keep going.

329
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,480
Rest when you're dead.

330
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,440
Can I show you something?

331
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:03,120
Frank, I felt DCI Carey should be
briefed on the ongoing developments.

332
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,480
Welcome to America.

333
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,119
Is that...? The hospital.

334
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:15,199
Staff entrance.
The night of DS Flynn's murder.

335
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,840
I thought whoever did this took over
the camera network completely?

336
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:24,999
This section of the briefing
is sensitive.

337
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,440
Understood.

338
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:31,839
Every state has its own style
when it comes to subterfuge.

339
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,679
Its own telltale signs.

340
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,919
The Russians, for instance,
very sloppy. Online and off.

341
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:40,480
They hacked SO15, but it appears
they didn't consider our...

342
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,719
...auxiliary network.

343
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,759
You can access the real footage?

344
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,279
We can recover it

345
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:50,479
from a covert signal
embedded in the time code.

346
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,399
It's kind of like scratching
the oil paint off a canvas

347
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,639
to reveal the pencil drawing
underneath.

348
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:58,480
Stop me if I'm... getting too
technical.

349
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,560
So, de-correction, then?

350
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:12,599
Eventually we'll recover
all the footage from the attack.

351
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:18,000
But, for now, our focus,
Todd, is this.

352
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,960
Nikolai Mirsky.

353
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,959
I-I thought Isaac Turner's
witness statement said

354
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,719
the killers were
wearing face masks.

355
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,800
Like I said, sloppy.

356
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:37,959
Result. Intelligence on the suspect
is patchy.

357
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:41,759
Facial rec points us to
a private security firm in Belarus.

358
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,879
Russian black ops,
by any other name.

359
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,399
Do we know if the suspect's
still in the UK?

360
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,519
They hacked the feeds at Heathrow
last time - they could do it again.

361
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,240
The manhunt is under way, Rachel.

362
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,239
I'd like you to run something else.

363
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:59,079
DC Tan is briefed
and making progress,

364
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:04,039
but this requires the leadership
of someone fully conversant.

365
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,639
What does, ma'am?

366
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,759
The criminal case
against the suspect.

367
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,399
We need an evidence dossier,

368
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,399
robust enough to put in front of
a judge.

369
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:19,040
The more evidence we can compile
against Nikolai Mirsky the better.

370
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,040
Understood.

371
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,280
You know the way back.

372
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,239
I appreciate the chance to speak,
Home Secretary.

373
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,079
I imagine you can guess what this
is about.

374
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,639
Uh, well, let me see. You told BBC
Breakfast I failed to deliver.

375
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:54,039
You told reporters I have
your full support.

376
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:57,359
So, at a push, I'd guess you were
trying to steal my fucking job?

377
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,119
So, I should have said
you don't have my support?

378
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,759
You'll be saying the department
needs a breath of fresh air next.

379
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,239
You're fucking me over, Isaac.

380
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,679
Have the decency to look me
in the eye while you're doing it.

381
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,839
You can hardly blame me for leaving
the department

382
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,359
acutely aware of its shortcomings.

383
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:13,079
Not to mention our unkept promise
of firm but fair immigration.

384
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,919
Oh, don't quote the manifesto at me.

385
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:17,240
You weren't even elected
when we wrote that.

386
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,520
After all I've done for you.

387
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,680
Go on.

388
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,320
No, what did you do for me,
Home Secretary?

389
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,880
Take a wild guess.

390
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,120
I mean, I thought I was selected for
government by the PM?

391
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:42,919
But if you had a hand in making me
Security Minister, Home Secretary...

392
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:45,839
I'm not talking about making
you a minister.

393
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,319
So, what are you talking about?

394
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,360
I'm talking about that girl.

395
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,999
Victoria Bello?

396
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,879
Unless you have others
that I don't know about?

397
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,679
I told you, that was all lies.

398
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,719
You told me that a few days ago.

399
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,559
That application hit my desk
six months back.

400
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:05,079
Sorry, hit your desk? Why yours?

401
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,719
Why don't you ask
your private secretary?

402
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,159
Aliza?

403
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,679
She came to you?

404
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:13,199
Yep. All flummoxed,
convinced it was real,

405
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,599
convinced that love child was yours,

406
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,119
and convinced, as I was, that
it would be the bloody ruin of you.

407
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,920
And then, so you...?

408
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,719
The file found its way
to the bottom of the pile.

409
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,200
Got lost. Drowned in a sea of
bureaucracy.

410
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,680
You're welcome.

411
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,400
So, that's how it's done, is it?

412
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,999
And all that
because you assumed it was true.

413
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,720
Don't be so bloody supercilious.
Are you really that surprised?

414
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,799
No, Home Secretary,
I'm not surprised. In fact,

415
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,119
it's exactly what I thought.

416
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,680
I just needed to hear you say it.

417
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,759
What do you mean? To say what?
What are you talking about?

418
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,320
Don't walk away from me.
Don't you...!

419
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:05,679
What is that?!
Are you recording this?!

420
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:09,079
Are you mad?! Recording the Home
Secretary without his consent!

421
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:11,159
That is a breach
of national security!

422
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,559
I will have you stripped

423
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:15,600
of every clearance level there is,
you little prick.

424
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,879
It's insurance, Rowan,
in case you try to deny it.

425
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,639
Deny it?! What are you talking
about?!

426
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,720
Why are you doing this to me,
Isaac?!

427
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:30,240
It's nothing personal.

428
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,680
QUIET CHATTER

429
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:13,519
Is it possible to embed a video
in time code?

430
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,159
You don't do small talk,
do you, Carey?

431
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,759
How's your day going, Tom?
Not bad. How's yours?

432
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:19,959
Good.

433
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,319
Is it possible to embed a video
in time code?

434
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,679
I think you mean a time code signal
in audio, don't you?

435
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,679
Nope. I mean what I said.

436
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,759
Well, then,
you're talking bollocks.

437
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,519
That's your technical assessment,
is it?

438
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,760
Yep.

439
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,439
I don't suppose it's possible
to recover a signal

440
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,679
from a hacked feed either, is it?

441
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:46,120
Like scratching the paint off
a canvas to reveal the drawing.

442
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,800
What are you talking about?

443
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,880
Nothing.

444
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:15,599
Ma'am. The suspect's name was used
to rent

445
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,559
a storage unit in Clapham two years
ago. It might be a dead end -

446
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,799
the storage company is
no longer in business,

447
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,280
but do you want me to head down
there and take a look?

448
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:27,640
No, you stay here. I'll go.
Yes, ma'am.

449
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,360
PHONE VIBRATES

450
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,639
Hello? It's me.

451
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:46,679
What phone are you calling from?
Have you left yet?

452
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:50,479
Yeah. Just now.
I'm right here. Why?

453
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,879
Good. I need you to do something
for me.

454
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,600
Look, in the bathroom,
there's a laptop.

455
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,880
Hi.

456
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,639
You guarantee
they won't print my name?

457
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:16,440
The clue is in the word anonymous.
Anonymous whistle-blower.

458
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,439
I'm afraid you've caught me
on the hoof.

459
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,639
Train was delayed
coming back from my conference,

460
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,839
and now I'm running late for
a dinner engagement.

461
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:52,599
I always seem to catch you either
coming or going. Time and tide.

462
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:55,839
Was that the Home Secretary's
conference? His big announcement?

463
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,160
Er, no. Different one.

464
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:03,200
They're here, aren't they?
Clear Horizons AI?

465
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:07,719
Yes, on the top floor.
US company, right?

466
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,759
Silicon Valley, of course.

467
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:13,160
But now they're taking over
the world, so to speak.

468
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,040
You must be delighted.

469
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,679
Your client winning the
UK facial recognition contract.

470
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:23,199
You mentioned half your clients were
in this building.

471
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,759
I'm assuming that includes them.

472
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:29,240
We don't get involved
with their commercial operations.

473
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,000
What do you get involved in?

474
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,839
I'm sorry, Detective,
but where's this going?

475
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,040
Surely you can see the problem,
Mr Knox.

476
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,479
You belong to an independent
advisory group.

477
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,879
You advised the government against
doing business with a Chinese firm,

478
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,640
whilst in the pocket
of their US rivals.

479
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,199
Looks like a conflict of interests
to me.

480
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,720
I assure you,
I'm not in anyone's pocket.

481
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:07,320
Tell me, what is it you do here,
exactly?

482
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:14,079
Your website mentions
political consultancy,

483
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,999
data analysis.

484
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,800
Sounds... vague.

485
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,559
I'd be glad to educate you,
Detective, but as I mentioned...

486
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,839
Half the social media companies
on the planet seem

487
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:28,919
to have an office in this building.
That's a lot of data to analyse.

488
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:31,400
But as I mentioned,
I don't have all evening.

489
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:37,599
How did you unmask the suspect
exactly? Nikolai Mirsky?

490
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:41,119
Well, you supplied the image.
You know which program we used.

491
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,439
Show me the process,
the working out.

492
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,879
That involves my technical team,
none of whom are here.

493
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,479
It's after hours.

494
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,199
Did you supply the image
to anyone outside this company?

495
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,319
You were quite clear about that.

496
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:56,199
See, you haven't actually answered
the question.

497
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:59,159
Is that something you teach
your politicians?

498
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,879
Am I under suspicion, Detective?

499
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,759
Increasingly.

500
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,279
Well, if you want to arrest me

501
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:07,200
for a conflict of interest,
go ahead.

502
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:10,080
That won't be the charge.

503
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:27,479
Suspect vehicle. Golf, X-ray,
six, six, Alpha, Echo Echo.

00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,999
Pos ID. Coleman Street, Echo,
Charlie, four.

505
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,839
Vehicle heading north.
Bring it up. Let's see it.

506
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:36,720
Deploy armed units to the vicinity.
Prepare for tactical response.

507
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:41,039
The murder of Edison Yao and the
attempt on your life were designed

508
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,639
to send Isaac Turner
into police protection,

509
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:46,359
to keep him out of the public eye.
That's when this began.

510
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:50,839
What began? The onslaught
of disinformation and lies

511
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:54,039
that led us to believe
we were under attack from China,

512
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:58,839
that ended with UK facial
recognition being handed to America.

513
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:01,160
You have completely lost me.

514
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,360
I don't believe you.

515
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:10,119
I'm not continuing this conversation
until I have a lawyer.

516
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:13,119
What is it you don't want me
to see on that laptop, Mr Knox?

517
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,519
What?

518
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,959
You've been glancing at it
like a schoolboy who forgot

519
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:20,000
to delete his search history.
This is ridiculous.

I can produce a warrant

to seize every computer
in this building within 20 minutes.

523
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,839
I'm afraid I've kept my dinner

524
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,639
companions waiting...
But at this point,

525
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:36,559
failure to cooperate will force my
hand. I employ corporate lawyers,

526
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,399
but not criminal ones, so I'd like
time to arrange representation.

527
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:42,000
Take one more step, and I will
have no option but to arrest.

528
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,999
Gregory Knox, I am arresting you
for obstructing a police officer

529
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,439
in the execution of their duty.
You do not have to say...

530
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,799
Where the fuck are you going?!

531
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:53,080
Do NOT make me add resisting
arrest to the list of charges!

532
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,800
Do not move.

533
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:04,039
Kilo 3 to all units.
Request urgent backup...

too unfavourably, Detective.

538
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,960
I'm not a violent person.

539
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,359
I've certainly never laid a finger
on a woman, as they say.

540
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,480
Present company excepted, of course.

541
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:51,279
Point is, I share the widely held
public-facing belief

542
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:54,279
that violence towards women
is abhorrent.

543
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:57,319
I say public-facing because online
it's a different picture.

544
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,119
You poll 100 university students -

545
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,719
"Is violence towards women ever justified?"

546
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,439
You'll get 100 emphatic noes.

547
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,919
But look at their Twitter feeds -

548
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,439
you'll find 10% to 15% have,

549
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,719
at some point or another,
sent death threats to women.

550
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,559
Just one of the countless incidences
of data providing

551
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:16,800
a clearer look at human behaviour
than humans themselves.

should've raised some alarm bells.

Esteemed friends,
honourable colleagues,

636
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:21,239
it is my privilege to present
to you this morning

637
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:24,639
the very latest developments
from the digital frontier,

638
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:27,480
where big data and politics
intersect.

639
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:31,439
Thanks to our clients in
social media,

640
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:35,559
Truro enjoys access
to an unparalleled wealth of data,

641
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:38,159
allowing us to track the activity

642
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:39,639
of approximately half

643
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:42,679
the internet-using population,
worldwide.

644

MURMURING

645
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:46,119
The songs they listen to
when they're sad,

646
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:48,079
the food they order
when they're lonely,

647
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:50,879
triggers that make them happy,
angry,

648
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:52,560
depressed or suicidal.

649
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,599
Billions upon billions
of data points,

650
00:47:56,600 --> 00:48:00,199
feeding one extraordinary,
ever-refining algorithm

651
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:02,279
that is demonstrably

652
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:06,680
the most successful predictor
of human behaviour to date.

653
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:10,559
But you know that.

00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:18,799
how Truro's algorithm is at work

657
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:22,559
on the art
of political electioneering.

Meet Alfonsi Guruli.

660
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:30,439
CHUCKLING

661
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:33,320
A political candidate
in need of a campaign.

662
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:38,839
Last summer, inspired by
a wave of optimism across

663
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:41,039
Georgia's burgeoning democracy,

664
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:44,039
Alfonsi decided to run
for Mayor of Tbilisi,

665
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:45,799
the capital city.

666
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:49,359
The candidate had no experience
or media training.

667
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:50,879
Um...

668
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:54,439
Just the kind of challenge we were
looking for.

669
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:56,759
What the fuck is this? Sh!

670
00:48:56,760 --> 00:49:00,719
So far, Alfonsi had sought
to promote himself as a family man,

671
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:02,039
a down-to-earth local

672
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:05,239
who understood the hopes
and dreams of the electorate.

673
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:07,479
COW MOOS
LAUGHTER

674
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:10,559
Yet his poll ratings refused
to rise.

675
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:12,599
LAUGHTER

676
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:15,839
At Truro, we set our algorithm
a goal -

677
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:19,480
to turn Alfonsi's fortunes around.

678

TRANSLATION:

680
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:36,200
An alternative portrait
of Alfonsi emerged.

681
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:41,599
Perhaps the squeaky-clean candidate
wasn't clean after all.

682
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:43,280
His opponents attacked.

683
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:47,280
Guruli must face the public
and explain himself.

684
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:52,159
Finally, the mayoral hopeful
had an audience.

685
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:54,480
A chance to get his message across.

686
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:17,239
GASPING

687
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:20,159
Alfonsi's supporters were
baffled.

688
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:23,400
But the algorithm had seen
what they couldn't.

689
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:28,480
Online, the data revealed
a different Tbilisi.

690
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:31,999
Here was a city at war

691
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,679
divided over a number
of burning issues.

692
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:37,159
Looking deeper, data revealed

693
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:40,639
exactly which issues caused
most concern,

694
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:44,840
which news stories literally kept
the locals awake at night.

695
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:53,919
The silent majority

696
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:55,719
had suddenly been spoken for.

697
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:59,279
"The real people of Tbilisi"
began to trend,

698
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:01,359
spawning a movement, a base.

699
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:04,399
CHANTING: Alfonsi! Alfonsi!

700
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:08,480
Alfonsi was a rising star of
the populist right.

701
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,719
Or so it seemed.

702
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:15,480

Scores of people
appeared on social media,

707
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,399
insisting he had always been

708
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:38,399
a strong advocate of gay rights.

709
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:41,600
The Alfonsi Guruli THEY knew
was no bigot.

710
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,119
A new narrative began to take shape.

711
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:47,999
Alfonsi was a savvy politician,

712
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,719
playing the orthodox right
for votes.

713
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:54,280
And the real REAL people of Tbilisi
knew that.

714
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:00,680
LAUGHTER

715
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:07,119
Truro's AI had created
a political campaign

716
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:08,920
for a polarised world...

717
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:14,519
...in which every different
sub-section of the electorate

718
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:17,680
is sold a version of the candidate
they can vote for.

719
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:31,199
Today, Alfonsi is Mayor of Tbilisi,

720
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:34,799
elected with 65% of the vote.

721

CHEERING AND WHOOPING

722
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:46,999
Perhaps next time we meet,

723
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,079
Truro's algorithm

724
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:51,560
will have decided the fate
of a British MP.

725
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:58,280
Or even PM.

You made me an advocate

00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:42,759
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.
It's the algorithm.

Every action suggested
by the algorithm

739
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:48,160
moves you one step closer
to where you want to be.

740
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:51,800
Where do you want to be, Isaac?

741
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:56,559
I don't need a program
to figure that one out.

But, goodness,
I'm getting ahead of myself.

746
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:15,479
The road to Number 10 is long.
Years of work.

747
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:18,519
We need to be patient.
Do as the algorithm says,

00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:21,239
step by step, heart to heart,

You actually... you actually believe
this shit?

754
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:39,599
You think that data witchcraft can
decide who runs the Home Office?

755
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:42,120
It can decide who runs the country.

756
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:46,960
Consider Home Secretary
your gruelling audition.

757

After everything you've put me
through. And my family...

759
00:54:56,840 --> 00:55:00,159
I should be ramming your head
through that wall.

00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:02,480
And yet you're not.

Your popularity is on the rise,

Your trusty spad will fill you in.

764
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:21,519
Sorry, what, you expect me
to collude in this fuckery?

765
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:23,599
I-I thought you didn't need me
anyway?

766
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:25,759
You built your own version
of me. Who, Digi-Zac?

767
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:27,119
I've enjoyed working with him,

768
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:28,959
but I'm thrilled you're ready
to take over.

769
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:31,359
The hell makes you think
I'm going to do that?

770
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:33,400
Why, the algorithm, of course.

771
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:38,600
The algorithm sees the world
in all its complexity.

772
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:44,839
The algorithm understands you, me,

773
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:47,479
and every segment of our society

774
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:49,400
better than we understand ourselves.

775
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:54,679
And it predicts, Isaac Turner,
that you will comply

776
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:58,120
with this campaign just as soon
as it brings you success.

777
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:04,560
For with success comes power.

778
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:08,120
And with power...

779
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:12,720
...you can do all the good
you've ever dreamt of.

I didn't say anything.

784
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:38,440
What?
