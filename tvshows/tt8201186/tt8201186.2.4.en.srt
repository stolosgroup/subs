1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,679
The UK's under attack by a
suspected foreign power.

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,279
Do you know what the government's
response is? Neither do I.

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:10,159
Gregory Knox? DS Flynn, Homicide.

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,519
I need you to follow me,
quickly and quietly.

5
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,319
Get in.

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:19,759
The cameras on Flynn's ward were
isolated, on a secure network,

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,319
controlled from the
seventh floor of CTC.

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,919
Operation Vanguard is compromised.

9
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:28,079
Thanks to us, a core
member of Napier's team was

10
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,399
given a full, unrestricted pass.

11
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,959
Louie, Rachel.

12
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,359
Whoever's behind this is watching
everything we do.

13
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,319
Who do we know with that
much access?

14
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,599
I'm advocating the use of racial
profiling wherever it keeps us safe.

15
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,639
Minister, we have to...
Now I'm finished.

16
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,239
Like everything else we've
discussed, Khadija, you keep this

17
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:47,479
under wraps. Until you can give me
everything, the deep fake scandal.

18
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,759
Mr Turner, why won't you respond to
the love child

19
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,799
allegations made by Victoria Bello?
In case you haven't noticed,

20
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,079
Isaac, you've just lost your job,
in government! It's over! No!

21
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:00,040
Welcome to the nightmare that is
correction, Isaac.

OVERLAPPING CONVERSATIONS
IN DIFFERENT LANGUAGES

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,959
Look, Abigail, this is a bad time.

26
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,759
Well, I can't choose when Mum
and Dad go on a city break.

27
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,439
I've got tons I need to talk
to you about.

28
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,119
I'm starting a podcast.

29
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,399
Maybe you can tell me about
it tomorrow.

30
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,159
Don't worry, I'll sleep, now you're
here.

31
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,679
It's been like this since
the burglary. Which is weird

32
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,359
because that happened in the daytime
when I wasn't even home.

33
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,960
What burglary?
I thought Dad would've told you.

34
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,439
You were burgled months ago
and nobody told me?

35
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:59,160
I'm a police detective!

ABIGAIL MOANS QUIETLY

38
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,159
The boiler's on a timer.

39
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,480
If you want a shower, you've got
five minutes.

40
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,759
Where are we going?

41
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,079
Not far.

42
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,599
That's why you said to come down?
So you could tell me not

43
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,959
to walk around the flat naked?
Exactly.

44
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,039
Does the idea of my naked body
offend you, Rachel?

45
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,599
It...
It's not the most private of flats.

46
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,439
What does that mean?

47
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,320
The neighbours? Can they see in?

48
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,919
Something like that.

49
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:30,039
What, are they perverts? Why don't
you just go and arrest them?

50
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,200
I'm working on it.

51
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,279
Look, it's just a suspicion, OK?

52
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,839
But it's a pretty strong suspicion,

53
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,599
so just definitely don't walk
around naked.

54
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,119
Yeah, I get it. Jesus.

55
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,639
Why didn't you just tell me all
this upstairs?

56
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,080
Because they listen, too.

57
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,719
If it's all the same to you,
Rachel...

58
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,559
...I don't think I'm going to stay
much longer. Actually,

59
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,479
I sort of need you to stay
for as long as you said you would.

60
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,519
If you change the plan, they might
assume it's because I've told you.

61
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,279
And? And, I don't want them to know
that I know that they're watching.

62
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,679
And what?

63
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,480
I'm supposed to hang out in
the flat while they spy on me?

64
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,720
You'd be surprised how quickly you
get used to it.

65
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,440
You are fucking weird.

66
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,120
WATER SPLASHES

67
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,159
HE EXHALES

68
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,440
Dad?!

69
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,319
There's more, look.

70
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,079
11, 12,

71
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,919
13, 14,

72
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,839
15,

73
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,159
16... Isaac! ..17, 18...

74

REPORTERS CHATTER

75
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,399
TV: The recently dismissed Minister
for Security, Isaac Turner,

76
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,999
is yet to respond to
requests for comment.

77
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,759
Ms Bello claims
the affair happened four years ago,

78
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,119
while the MP was visiting
Nigeria.

79
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,079
Now she and her three-year-old son
are applying

80
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,519
for British citizenship amid
questions of political assistance

81
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,239
and interference.

82
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,279
I told McKenzie to shut this down.

83
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,119
You knew about it?!

84
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,839
I-I knew it was circling.

85
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,359
REPORTER: Did Zac Turner use his
power at the Home Office

86
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,439
to block this young
woman's application?

87
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,639
Why didn't you tell me?

88
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,919
There's nothing to tell.
It's a baseless smear.

89
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,319
You two, upstairs.

90
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,799
And stay away from the TV.

91
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,480
She's got an iPhone, Isaac.

92
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,119
Hello? Have you seen it?

93
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,599
Of course you've seen it.
Look, I need you to find

94
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,199
the paperwork before anyone else
gets their claws into it.

95
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,319
We need a full timeline
of Bello's application

96
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,759
to show there was no interference
from our department.

97
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,559
I've moved to Policy, Isaac. I don't
work... I know you don't work

98
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,039
for me any more, I'm not an idiot.

99
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,319
I-I just guessed you might be
interested in helping me,

100
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,759
seeing as this implicates you too.

101
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,559
You know I'd want to help you.

102
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,959
But?

103
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,159
You're a bit... toxic right now.

104
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,480
So you're still checking my numbers?

105
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,640
Why did you say those things?

106
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,479
Look, I'm working on something,
but when I'm done,

107
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,840
it won't be me who's toxic.

108
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,400
I'll do what I can.

109
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,399
I am not one of your fawning staff,
I am not Aliza,

110
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,960
I am your wife. What is going on?

111
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,560
Will you stay?

112
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,800
Fine.

113
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,359
But I want us to spend
the evening together.

114
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,959
What did you have in mind?

115
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,440
Talk? You know, be sisters?

116
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,039
And I want to tell you about
my podcast.

117
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,640
Tonight. Sounds good.

118
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,039
Can I help you?

119
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,559
I tried calling you, ma'am.

120
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,599
DSU Garland instructed me to run

121
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,000
the homicide reports in
your absence.

122
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,839
And...?

123
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,840
I just wondered if you had any
guidance for me?

124
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,040
I'm on compassionate leave.

125
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,599
Yes, DSU Garland mentioned that.

126
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,039
I just...

127
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,079
...didn't want to tread on your toes

128
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,600
without checking.

129
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,760
What's the status on Vanguard?

130
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,879
No change.
The camera networks?

131
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,479
Assumed compromised.
Tech's working on a solution.

132
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,239
Update me when they have one.
Meanwhile, cross-check ballistics

133
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,999
and forensics from
the hospital against

134
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,719
the attacks on Edison Yao
and Joseph Mwangi.

135
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,400
Yes, ma'am.

136
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,720
WHISPERS: That should keep you busy.

137
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,479
Is it even safe to talk?

138
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,999
For now.

139
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,679
We've swept the hardware,
found no devices.

140
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,039
Assuming the compromise came via
the network,

141
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,839
it's neutralised, it's offline.
But...?

142
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,039
Well, we can open the beach,

143
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,959
but it's not safe to go back in
the water.

144
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,199
Soon as the ops room's back online,
it's at risk.

145
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:59,559
Where the fuck are we supposed
to go if they can hack us here?

146
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:02,079
Look, it's maybe not be my place
to ask,

147
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:06,880
Guv, but are we doing enough
to rule out internal compromise?

148
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,799
Anyone in particular you're
concerned about?

149
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,199
No-one in particular.
I just don't want to move the op,

150
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,400
only to find out
the problem's moved with us.

151
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,800
You're right, Tom.
It's not your place.

152
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,880
Understood.

153
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,679
MOWER BUZZES
What are you doing?!

154
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,599
I don't know what kind
of microphones they have out there.

155
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,159
I don't even know if
the house is safe.

156
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,199
Fuck sake! Our police protection?

157
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,679
For all we know it was them that
bugged the place.

158
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,679
Did you have eyes on the whole time?

159
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,159
Eyes on?
Why would they want to bug us?

160
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,879
It's the kind of thing I can't get
into, Simmy. Security things.

161
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,479
I'm not talking about security
things. SHE SWITCHES OFF MOWER

162
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,399
I'm asking about the woman on
the news

163
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,800
who said she had your child.

164
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,199
Yeah. Victoria.

165
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,559
She's a care worker.
She looked after Mum, at the end.

166
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,879
So, you know her?

167
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,999
We met at the funeral.

168
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,559
SHE SCOFFS And now what?

169
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:14,199
She's just cooked this up to try
and get into the country?

170
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,759
It's bigger than that.
HE TURNS MOWER BACK ON

171
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,479
Somebody else is behind it.
At first I thought it was China,

172
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,639
trying to smear me in the run-up to
the facial rec contract.

173
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,279
And now?

174
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,520
Now...
MOWER STOPS

175
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,560
Who turned that off?
Who turned it off?!

176
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,880
Isaac, enough!

177
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,240
You tripped the switch.

178
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,879
Look, I'm sorry

179
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,920
for all the "need to know" crap.

180
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,880
I just need you to trust me.

181
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,600
What's all this?

182
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,359
TV: On behalf of Ms Bello, we have
written to Mr Turner this morning,

183
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,519
requesting a sample of his DNA
for paternity testing.

184
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:25,279
If Mr Turner fails to provide
a sample within seven days,

185
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,519
then we will begin
court proceedings.

186
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:30,079
Ms Bello claims
the affair happened four years ago,

187
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,599
while the MP was visiting Nigeria.

188
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,919
Now she and her three-year-old
son...

189
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,039
No, no, this isn't about China.

190
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,840
It's not about facial rec.

191
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,960
This is about me.

192
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,680
Someone's trying to destroy me.

193
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,479
TV: Isaac Turner has found himself
at the centre of an

194
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,359
immigration scandal.
The question still remains...

195
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,479
This ring any bells?

196
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:00,119
I thought you said you could shut
this story down.

197
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,839
I stopped the BBC from breaking it.
It's not on the BBC!

198
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,520
It's all different channels
these days, McKenzie!

199
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,879
Had such high hopes for him,
you know.

200
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,199
From the person who sacked him?
I didn't have much of a choice.

201
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,719
It's hardly going to help his
chances of bouncing back.

202
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,759
Sir? Commander Hart to see you.

203
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,559
And more shit, hot off the shovel.
Home Secretary.

204
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,079
Danny. Seen this?

205
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:30,519
It's your daily briefing on
Vanguard, sir.

206
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,879
Go on, McKenzie. Fuck off.

207
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,679
Following last night's attack,

208
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,319
the operation remains
profoundly compromised.

209
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,239
Comms and camera networks
are not secure.

210
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,559
Technical staff are working
round the clock

211
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,479
to safeguard the op,
but until then...

212
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,079
It's 1956. Who's doing this?

213
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,039
Our focus is widening.

214
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,519
Suspects besides China are
being explored.

215
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:55,399
I thought as much. Just typical.

216
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,239
I'm sorry?

217
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,919
It may have been possible.

218
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,279
Who knows what Beijing
is thinking?

219
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,639
It just didn't sound right to me.

220
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,479
You've lost me, Home Secretary.

221
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,919
China didn't
need to strong-arm us into

222
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,599
the facial rec contract.
They had it in the bag.

223
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,279
But why commission Turner's report
if your mind was already made up?

224
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:18,919
The public need to see a
process, Danny.

225
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,919
All voices aired.

226
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,199
And Turner's concerns are valid.

227
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,279
China poses a security risk.

228
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,319
Yes. We know.

229
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,759
Then you should also know

230
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,279
that the risk posed by going
with China is the same as

231
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,759
the risk posed by not going
with China.

232
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,720
If they feel like hacking us,
that is in their gift.

233
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,239
So, who would you go with?

234
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,840
After China, who else is there?

235
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:03,999
Everything the Home Secretary says
backs up Rachel Carey's theory.

236
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,239
China's going to lose
the facial rec bid,

237
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,880
the US are waiting in line.

238
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,080
You still don't trust her?

239
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,520
The jury is very much out on that.

240
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,399
Did she seem stable to you?

241
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:24,440
You mean, after she found
DS Flynn murdered? Hmm.

242
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,799
What's Frank got to say
for himself?

243
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,160
So far, he's proving elusive.

244
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,239
We need a clean shot
and secure comms.

245
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,479
If Frank's not to blame, he can
bloody well help.

246
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,959
Doorstep him if you have to.

247
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,800
Remind him the special relationship
is meant to be reciprocal.

248
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,040
What was that?

249
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,839
Take it back. Take it back.

250
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,559
I'm afraid I can't take it back.

251
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,159
We are midway through
a procedure.

252
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,439
You saw that lump, didn't you?
You have to remember,

253
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,639
these tests are
a precaution while we await

254
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,279
the reports from your biopsy and CT.

255
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:21,040
If the results are still unclear we
will move on to capsule endoscopy.

256
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,599
I had one of those, didn't I?

257
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,799
No. With capsule endoscopy,

258
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,159
you'll swallow a small pill
containing a wireless camera,

259
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,959
which passes through
the small intestine,

260
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:36,759
taking and transmitting many
hundreds of video images

261
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,359
for analysis.
HE CHUCKLES

262
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:42,759
It's remarkable the things that can
be done with a camera nowadays.

263
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,600
Is that so?

264
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,920

00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,599
First Rowan's not answering
my calls, now Rhys.

268
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:25,919
I stop being a minister for what,
ten minutes, I'm a pariah?

269
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,679
If I was still at the Home Office,

270
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,239
I'd have the PR war machine gunning
for these pricks.

271
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,279
Well, you're not at the
Home Office.

272
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,360
You're at home.

273
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,560
Can I make a suggestion?

274
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,600
Just agree to the paternity test.

275
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,159
Don't you see?
There won't be a paternity test.

276
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:48,759
Because they'll fake it,
like they fake everything else.

277
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,479
Hello?

278
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,640
Does your property have
rear access?

279
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:00,799
Thanks so much for coming in,
chez Turner. Sorry for the...

Rachel.

283
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,240
Do you mind if I...?
Yes, yes.

285
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,839
I thought you didn't trust
the police.

286
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,079
Yes.

287
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,200
I mean, I trust her.

288
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,879
All clear?

289
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,639
From now on,

290
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,320
if you want to contact me,
I'd like you to use this.

291
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:53,600
Would you mind if I had a word
with the minister in private?

292
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,959
Former... minister.

293
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,800
Keep up.

294
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,880
Yeah, it's him.

295
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,399
How confident are you?

296
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,399
I'm confident.

297
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,519
Those are the guys I saw getting
into the grey van.

298
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,959
HE CHUCKLES

299
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,759
Can you ID him?

300
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,599
With that mask,
facial rec won't be easy.

301
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,279
That's if I can even find someone
I trust enough to run

302
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,479
the search. If I give this to SO15,

303
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,319
they'll want to know where it
came from.

304
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:34,600
You can hardly say you were wearing
a hidden camera. Well...

305
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,000
Uh, well...

306
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,039
...I got the Home Secretary to admit

307
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:45,199
the government is complicit
in Correction.

308
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,399
Khadija's tie camera? You did it?

309
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,399
Being honest, I've no idea how I
managed to record anything over

310
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,119
the thumping of my heart!

311
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,799
I kept thinking he'd suss
me any second.

312
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:58,319
Does that give us enough
to take to Khadija?

313
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,119
Against Correction? Mm.

314
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,439
I've barely got my foot in the door.

315
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,439
I need to witness
the UK Correction program me from

316
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,959
the inside.
I need to record enough evidence

317
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,759
to prove what they're capable of,
beyond doubt.

318
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,919
And I need to do it all without
getting caught.

319
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,639
So, what are you thinking,
potentially?

320
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,960
Months?

321
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,439
I don't know.

322
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,999
Years? I don't know.

323
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,720
The people involved in this...

324
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,600
...they'll stop at nothing
to keep it secret.

325
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,640
You've seen the latest?

326
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,519
The Lagos thing?

327
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,719
Well, I wasn't sure if that was...

328
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,919
What, you thought it was real?

329
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,719
You're a politician.

330
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,280
I'm not that kind of politician.
I wasn't judging.

331
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,679
It's all part of it.

332
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,199
You said yourself,

333
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:00,239
this isn't China trying
to take our facial rec.

334
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,720
Someone wants to destroy me.

335
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,760
You must have made some
powerful enemies.

336
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,759
I'm trying to catch
the man who killed my friend.

337
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:15,400
If we can get to him,
maybe he can fill in the blanks.

338
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,240
I think I know someone
who can help.

339
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,279
I don't appreciate your minion
tailing me to

340
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:29,359
a private appointment, much less
reporting it.

341
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,480
I hope you know what you're doing,
taking her under your wing.

342
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,920
On behalf of the Service, I
apologise for DCI Carey's behaviour.

343
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:44,120
As regards your privacy, I'm...
Stomach.

344
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,839
They think...
Jesus...

345
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,079
...Frank.

346
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:55,479
Got me waiting by the phone like
a lovesick 12-year-old.

347
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:58,319
Who's your doctor?
Stanley fucking Kubrick.

348
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,679
Shoved a camera up my ass,
down my throat.

349
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,759
Now he wants me
to swallow one whole,

350
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:05,679
like my stomach hasn't been through
enough fireball spinning all

351
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:08,359
night long. I'm sorry.

352
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,639
What about the embassy?
Are they looking after you?

353
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,799
I haven't told them. You're sick,
they look at you differently,

354
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:18,560
like you're some sort
of fucking nonentity.

355
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,000
I kept mine to myself.

356
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,719
You had cancer?

357
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,800
Told work I was glamping in
the Hebrides.

358
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,479
In fact, I was having my thyroid
gland removed at

359
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,359
the Royal Marsden.

360
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,799
I was lucky, relatively.

361
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,439
Wow.

362
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,279
It never came back?

363
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,840
No chemo?

364
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,119
Complete remission for seven years.

365
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,360
Mazel tov.
HE KNOCKS ON TABLE

366
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,400
What do you put that down to?

367
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,280
Sorry, I didn't ask you here
to swap health stories.

368
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,839
And now I can't even ask
you what I need to.

369
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,319
Because I'm sick?

370
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,960
Didn't you just hear what I said?

371
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,319
The BBC's suffered a second hack.

372
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,239
This time direct on the Newsnight
studio.

373
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,040
The hardware sabotaged.

374
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,879
Still haven't heard a question.

375
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:29,119
We ran checks on everybody who had
access to

376
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,879
the equipment...

377
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,879
...with one exception.

378
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,759
You think it's the kid I sent, huh?

379
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:37,439
You think Louie sabotaged your
news program me?

380
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,079
I mean, Jesus Christ,

381
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,879
I was trying to do you
a fucking favour. I had to ask.

382
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,319
Whoever's behind this has the
capacity to compromise

383
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,959
Operation Vanguard entirely.
Beijing.

384
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,319
Our suspicions are shifting away
from China.

385
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,319
Ah, where are they shifting to?

386
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,999
I could share that...

387
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,599
...if you were prepared to help.

388
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,599
HE CHUCKLES

389
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:00,639
You accuse me of sabotage,
and now you want my help?

390
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,239
If the accusation's false,
you should have no reason not to.

391
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,920
Mm-mm-mm.

392
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:11,159
The seventh floor is down.
Vanguard needs a new home.

393
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:14,040
And I'm the little piggy who built
his house out of brick.

394
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,280
Can you let us in?

395
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,519
I'll consider it.

396
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,999
Can you consider it soon?

397
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,600
Our officers are being killed.

398
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:32,039
Yeah, sorry about that.

399
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,200
Flynn.

400
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,200
Fucking shame.

401
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,479
Faith.

402
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,839
What's that?

403
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,479
What I put my recovery down to.

404
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,279
HE SCOFFS Fuck off.

405
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,720
Well, I was hardly devout.

406
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,799
I quit Sunday School after they told
me I'd sinned

407
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,280
for kissing Sarah Crawley in
the Bible cupboard.

408
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,759
SHE LAUGHS

409
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:02,400
But, yeah, it helped.

410
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,800
Revisiting my religion.

411
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:11,280
Prayer, confession... repentance.

412
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:17,599
Obviously,
we're not from the same faith.

413
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,479
We carry the same burdens.

414
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,640
Guilt and regret.

415
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,279
If you want to give yourself
the best chance,

416
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,800
you'll free yourself of them.

417
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,440
Who says I have any guilt
or regret?

418
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,320
A lifetime in our trade?

419
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,080
Come on, Frank.

420
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,519
Don't tell me your stomach's the
only thing keeping you

421
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,920
awake at night.

422
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,280
Ooh. Enjoy. Thank you.

423
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,919
I just came to grab a few things.

424
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:09,639
I'm rushing straight out again.
Due at a conference. To tell

425
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:13,039
you the truth, I'd rather avoid this
place altogether.

426
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,919
Not easy when half your clients are
in the same building.

427
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,319
I can see how busy you are.

428
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,919
Oh, no, please.
They said there'd be follow-ups.

429
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:22,679
Your colleagues came
to see me this morning.

430
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:25,079
Has there been a
development in the case?

431
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:28,839
Actually, Mr Knox,
I came to ask for your help.

432
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,719
Help?

433
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,119
I understand you have access to

434
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,799
the Xanda Tech facial
recognition software.

435
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,359
It-it-it was well within

436
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:41,199
the CRC's remit
to assess Xanda's capabilities.

437
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,040
Mr Knox, you're not in trouble.
May I show you something?

438
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,959
I see.

439
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,439
The mask.

440
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:09,279
Turner said the Xanda program me
can unmask?

441
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,720
Is this him?

442
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,840
The man who tried to kill me?

443
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:20,120
The detective who saved your life,
Patrick Flynn...

444
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,560
...he died.

445
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,360
You help me,
I can bring his killers to justice.

446
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,799
I'll do what I can.

447
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,280
INDISTINCT CHATTER

448
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,399
It's getting busy out there.

449
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:48,519
Really, I should start canvassing.
Either that

450
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:51,920
or borrow an air rifle from one of
the neighbours.

451
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,719
Is there anything else
you want tell me...

452
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,439
...about Lagos?

453
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,560
No, I don't think so.

454
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:19,919
I mean... I don't even remember that.

455
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:22,199
Wait, is that supposed
to be my hand?

456
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,959
Which? The one holding the
glass of wine,

457
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,919
or the one holding her waist?

458
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,599
Simmy, this-this is faked.

459
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,319
SHE SCOFFS Fake photo.

460
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,039
That's what you're going with.

461
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,959
Obviously not completely fake.
But, I mean, that's not my hand.

462
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,159
Not your hand? Whose hand is it?

463
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,079
Yeah, you know what I mean.

464
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,919
You look like you were enjoying
yourself at the funeral.

465
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,359
Come on.

466
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,759
I mean, that's not...

467
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:47,600
Obviously, it wasn't all doom and
gloom. No, I can see!

468
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:52,159
Remind me why you didn't take me
with you.

469
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,679
Why I didn't take you with...?

470
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:56,159
You're the one who chose not
to come. Do you not remember?

471
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,839
Harry was starting nursery.
You were starting back at work.

472
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:01,439
You didn't complain, going alone.
Well, it's not exactly like

473
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,879
the two of you saw eye-to-eye.
Who sees eye-to-eye with their

474
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,199
mother-in-law? You still go.

475
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,359
Well, maybe you should have been
there, then.

476
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,600
Dad?

477
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,640
Who took this? Isaac. Isaac!

478
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:29,360
Ruby, pack a bag,
we're going to Nanny's.

479
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,999
Oi! Oi!

480
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,079
How much did they pay you for it?!

481
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,600
Pricks!

482
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,839
Who lives in that house?

483
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,759
The one over there with
the green shed.

484
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,679
Oh, uh, Rubes?

485
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:55,319
I've told her to pack
a change of clothes.

486
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,639
Why?

487
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,919
I'm taking them to Mum's.

488
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:00,919
Oh, come on,
please, you don't need to do that.

489
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:03,079
Simmy, surely you can see this is
all fake.

490
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:05,239
Ruby, and a toothbrush!

491
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,799
I need to work.
The kids need to get out the house.

492
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,239
Simm, I didn't put my hand on
her waist.

493
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,839
It looked pretty convincing.

494
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,959
Trust me. You have no idea.

495
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,039
Simone, think about it.

496
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:19,240
If you leave now,
how's it going to look?

497
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:24,559
You're worried how it's going to
look? A bit, it makes it look like

498
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:27,599
this love-child nonsense is getting
to us.

499
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,919
It is. A bit!

500
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:32,560
OK, at least let me walk you to
the car.

501
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:39,360
REPORTERS AND ONLOOKERS CLAMOUR

502
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:06,479
I hope you're proud of yourselves.
I beg your pardon, Mr Turner?

503
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,199
I said I hope you're proud, forcing
my family away from their home.

504
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,559
Will you agree to
a paternity test, Mr Turner?

505
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,199
Ha-ha! You'd like that, wouldn't
you?

506
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,799
We'd like you to take our questions,
Mr Turner. You know what?

507
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,279
I would take your questions if
I could trust you

508
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,639
to report my answers.
But you're not here for the facts,

509
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,119
are you?
You're here to stir the pot.

510
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,599
You're here to turn this nothing of
a story into a scandal.

511
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,719
No wonder mainstream media's time
is up. You know what? You're right.

512
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,519
Get your phones out.

513
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,759
If you're not part of
the mainstream media,

514
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,079
get your phones out
and hit the red button,

515
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,679
because you cannot trust this lot
to tell the truth.

516
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:41,519
It's not even their fault.
Most of them, all of them,

517
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:44,919
they don't have any idea how fake
their own news is.

518
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:47,759
They're just doing their jobs,
chasing stories that don't exist,

519
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,519
ruining lives without
taking responsibility.

520
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:53,439
How many times have we
seen families hounded by

521
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,799
the media like this?
Then the truth comes out

522
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,399
and they all move on,
and do they apologise?

523
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:02,319
No, of course not. You know what?

524
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,639
I've got news for them.

525
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,599
The truth IS coming.

526
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:09,079
And when it comes,
you'll know about it, believe me.

527
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:11,439
It's going to blow this bullshit
right out of the water.

528
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,040
Until then, my advice...?

529
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,839
Don't believe a single word they
tell you. Excuse me.

530
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:20,960
WHOOPING AND YELLING

531
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:42,679
Thank you for coming straight away,
Mr Napier.

532
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:46,959
As we can see from your CT,
there is significant lesser curve

533
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:50,599
gastric wall thickening
with extensive regional adenopathy.

534
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,399
There appears to be extensive
lesions within

535
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,119
the right lobe of the liver,

536
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,639
and above the diaphragm there are

537
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,919
multiple sub-centimetre bilateral

538
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,799
pulmonary lesions...
Doc.

539
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:06,399
I've had a burning in the pit of
my stomach for the past four months.

540
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,199
Whatever you've got to tell me,

541
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:12,119
I've already imagined it
and worse. So, please,

542
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:15,799
in English, what am I looking at?

543
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,680
Stage four stomach cancer.

544
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,839
Once we've received the results of
your biopsy,

545
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,680
we can make a diagnosis...

546
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:30,239
Mr Napier,

547
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,719
patients often find it useful to
include a friend or a family member

548
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,519
in this part of the process.

549
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:39,960
Someone to ask questions,
take information on board.

550
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,480
Do you have somebody
who could do that?

551
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:51,719
TV: Isaac Turner lashed out at the
press on his doorstep this morning,

552
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:54,079
in a tirade against
the British media.

553
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,999
You seen it? ...families hounded
by the media like this!

554
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,559
And do they apologise?
No, of course not.

555
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,839
You know what?

556
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,039
I've got some news for them.

557
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,799
The truth IS coming...

558
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,559
God, he sounds like
a religious nut.

559
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,759
LAUGHTER Jesus wept.

560
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,119
...and when it comes, believe me,

561
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,439
it's going to blow this bullshit
right out of the water.

562
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,759
Until then, my advice?

563
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,239
Don't believe a single word they
tell you.

564
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,719
His erratic behaviour is
the latest in

565
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,600
a long line of scandals...

566
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,679
Do you think our esteemed
Home Secretary regrets allowing

567
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,520
Isaac Turner quite so much insight?

568
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,760
It's not like he actually said it.

569
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,600
Are we going to wait until he does?

570
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,559
That was not helpful.

571
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,079
It seems to have got
the vultures off my drive, so...

572
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,759
"The truth is coming"?
What was that, a teaser?

573
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,319
"Don't believe a single word"
seems to be trending higher.

574
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,079
I've told you what they're
capable of.

575
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,239
You want to scream from
the rooftops?

576
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,879
You will get your chance.
But until I tell you otherwise,

577
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,239
just... whatever they say,

578
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,720
just keep your head down
and go along with it.

579
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,279
What about Knox?

580
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,439
Did he agree to help?

581
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,119
After some persuading.

582
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,480
I'm toxic, right?

583
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:20,160
Maybe this test will buy you
some favour.

584
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,119
Test?

585
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,840
Yeah. I saw your tweet.

586
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,599
"#TheRealZacTurner.

587
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:34,479
"Looking forward to paternity test
results. Nothing to hide."

588
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,639
What the...?

589
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,480
That's my study.

590
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,280
I take it that's not you, then.

591
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,720
Isaac?

592
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,000
Isaac?

593
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:53,240
CALL CUTS OFF

594
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,399
Hello, everyone.

595
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:30,199
I just wanted to respond,
directly and calmly,

596
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,999
to the allegations you're
hearing about me,

597
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,559
which I can assure you are entirely
without merit.

598
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,839
I've nothing to hide,

599
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:41,680
which is why I am co-operating
with the paternity test.

600
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,439
In fact, I have agreed

601
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,759
to appear first thing tomorrow
morning on BBC One,

602
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,679
by which time, I'm told,
we can expect a result,

603
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,080
to give my side of the story.

604
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,200
So let's hope they listen.

605
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,920
Looking forward
to seeing you all at breakfast.

606
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,760
Once again, nothing to hide.

607
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,159
Well, this is random.

608
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,760
What were you expecting,
a bench by the Thames?

609
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,639
It's a CCTV blind spot. I don't get
to choose where they are.

610
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:26,279
You promised me an exclusive.

611
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,919
If Isaac Turner has a meltdown
and blurts it out to anyone with

612
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:31,839
a phone, that's not exclusive.
He won't.

613
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:35,079
You sure about that? You're not just
the least bit concerned about where

614
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,720
his head's at?

615
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:47,799
RECORDING: Welcome to the nightmare
that is Correction, Isaac.

616
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,279
Is this Rowan Gill?

617
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:52,359
Our enemies fake
things that we can't deny.

618
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,799
He bugged the Home Secretary
with your hidden camera.

619
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,479
His head is in the right place.

620
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:00,279
Worst of all, if we do ever prove it
or deny it, we're fucked.

621
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:03,240
Why? You know why.
We're as guilty of it as they are!

622
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,959
I'm going to need the file.

623
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,599
Not yet.

624
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,960
Khadija, you know the risks if we
move too soon.

625
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,959
SHE SIGHS

626
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,039
Well, make sure Turner stays
on point.

627
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:20,399
We sat on that love child story
for him.

628
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,719
He pays us back by
ranting against the media?

629
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,240
He was just letting off steam.

630
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,360
Well, two can play at that.

631
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,520
You know, Rabbi...

632
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:07,959
...you think about all the good
things that you did

633
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:11,080
in your life and...

634
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,960
And all the bad things?

635
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,879
Everything I did...

636
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,360
...everything...

637
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:29,280
...was in the service of making
the world a safer place.

638
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:36,080
I'm just not sure that...

639
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,400
...everyone's going to
see it that way.

640
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:46,400
So, this is why you've come back
to shul after 50 years?

641
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,560
To atone for your sins.

642
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,719
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you,

643
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,679
but you've come to the wrong place.

644
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,599
No amount of prayers can save you
from your sins against your fellow

645
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,999
human beings,

646
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,680
and no rabbi can offer
you forgiveness.

647
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,600
Your atonement is in your hands...

648
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,000
...through your mitzvahs...

649
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:16,000
...your good deeds in everyday life.

650
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:26,040
INTERNAL RINGTONE

651
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:31,719
My God, I've been trying
to call you all evening.

652
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,479
I was putting the kids to bed.

653
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:36,759
Besides, I know what you're
going to say. Oh, yeah?

654
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:39,199
That tweet wasn't real,
nothing's real.

655
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:43,799
What about that rant on our
doorstep? Was that real?

656
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,919
Uh, yeah.

657
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,879
That was real.

658
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:50,399
Listen, Simone...

659
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,000
...tomorrow morning, on the TV...

660
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,160
...they're going to make it seem
like I'm the father of that boy.

661
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,679
Who hates you enough to do all this,
Isaac?

662
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:06,560
I mean, apart from me right now.

663
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,360
Why do you hesitate?

664
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:19,000
Earlier, when I suggested you do the
paternity test, you hesitated.

665
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,639
Did I?

666
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,040
There it is again.

667
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:28,119
I don't know, Simone.

668
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:30,479
Maybe I am the father.

669
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,280
He looks like you.

670
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,919
What?

671
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,999
Victoria Bello's son, Amandi.

672
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,320
I've been looking at him.

673
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,359
So, I mean, what, what are you

674
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:45,239
trying to say exactly? We all look
the same?

675
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,679
No, Isaac,

676
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:48,280
I'm saying he looks like you.

677
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,080
Just wait one second.

678
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:58,759
Isaac, what is it?

679
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:02,120
There's another fucking journalist.
Hold on, I'll call you back.

680
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,679
It's 11 o'clock at night!

681
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:09,479
What the hell do you think
you're doing?!

682
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,159
Look, I'm sorry for the tardiness.

683
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:13,839
I'm here to pick up
a Mr Isaac Turner?

684
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,479
For what?

685
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,799
You're going to Media City?

686
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:21,879
What, Manchester? Uh, Salford.
I'm going to be on the telly, am I?

687
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:24,759
Well, I believe so, sir, yeah.

688
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:29,159
So, what, BBC Breakfast
are expecting me?

689
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:32,280
You are... Isaac Turner?

690
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:44,640
Make yourself comfortable in
the back, sir.

691
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:32,519
Just one puff. It'll stop you
stressing all the time.

692
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,480
I'll smoke that...

693
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:38,160
...if you drink this, neat.

694
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:40,959
Who says "neat"?

695
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:43,399
It sounds like something Dad
would say.

696
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:45,999
It means without a mixer, you idiot.

697
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,280
Oh.

698
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,839
Your turn.

699
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:56,160
Oh, shit.

700
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:01,559
TV: ..firm but fair. So why, then,

701
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:03,919
did the woman who claims
to have had a lovechild with

702
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:07,479
the Security Minster
find her application languishing in

703
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:11,319
the system five times longer
than average?

704
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:13,599
Coincidence or interference?

705
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:15,679
In an exclusive interview,

706
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:18,519
we speak to Victoria Bello
from her home in Lagos.

707
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:20,359
Oh, fuck.

708
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:22,999
I was told over
and over by the Home Office

709
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,479
that my application could not
be traced.

710
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:27,879
Once, they even told me that
I must have been mistaken

711
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:29,319
and I couldn't have applied,

712
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:31,959
as if they were trying
to wear me down.

713
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:34,999
Look, I don't want anything from
Mr Isaac Turner.

714
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,759
But my son has the right to grow up
in the country of his father.

715
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:41,679
Later I'll be speaking to the
Shadow Home Secretary,

716
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:44,679
who is leading the calls for an
urgent inquiry into

717
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:48,040
the mishandling of Bello's case
by the Home Office.

718
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:53,879
You do?
Oh, Abby, I think you're right.

719
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:57,359
I really do need to sleep.
It's been really fun.

720
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:59,839
Wait, I still haven't
told you about my podcast.

721
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:01,319
RACHEL SIGHS

722
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:04,159
Go on, then,
tell me about your podcast.

723
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:07,439
Don't diss it till you've heard it,
Judge Judy. Mm-hm.

724
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,119
You'd actually be really into it.

725
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:13,279
It's a bit like Serial,
only it's called Free Shaun.

726
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:17,239
Or I might go more esoteric like
The Bus Stop.

727
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:19,759
What are you talking about?

728
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:21,800
Free Shaun? As in Shaun Emery?

729
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:25,319
Half the people think he killed
that woman,

730
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:27,200
the other half didn't.

731
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:29,880
But they don't know.

732
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:32,600
I've met him.

733
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:37,199
Abigail, Shaun Emery was guilty.

734
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:38,799
What?

735
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,879
He pleaded guilty at the hearing.
I should know. I was there.

736
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:44,799
But you said...?
I was wrong.

737
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:48,959
Look, I-I think it's great that
you're podcasting.

738
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:51,640
I think it's really... neat.

739
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:56,519
But I just think you should pick
a different story.

740
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:59,400
I mean, that story's over.

741
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:23,959
They've got you staying at
the Donlevy Hotel.

742
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:26,680
Would you like to check in
or go straight to the studio?

743
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,680
Yes, just go straight to the studio.

744
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:57,040
Isaac?

745
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:11,479
Mini... Oops,
nearly called you "Minister" then.

746
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:14,039
Easily done. Thanks for coming in
so horribly early.

747
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:15,359
After all the build-up,

748
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:17,959
we just had to lead with
the lovechild.

749
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:20,039
So, I'm really going on, then?

750
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:22,599
Um, I certainly hope so!

751
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:24,719
I suppose they'll just
hack into it live.

752
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,999
I wonder what they'll make me say
this time.

753
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,319
Do you, um,
need somewhere to change?

754
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:30,440
No.

755
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,519
Right, then.

756
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:36,079
There's teas and coffees in
the green room.

757
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:38,119
Are you a part of it?

758
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:39,839
Part of...?

759
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:43,239
Cos someone must be, on the inside.

760
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:45,559
PHONE BUZZES

761
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:47,000
Just one second.

762
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:52,519
Hello? Isaac?

763
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:54,159
Aliza?

764
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:57,199
I thought your 6am calls
were a thing of the past.

765
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:58,839
Only when it's good news, right?

766
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:01,519
What, you can prove no-one's
interfered with the Bello case?

767
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,599
No. I haven't even looked
into that.

768
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:06,239
Right, well, Newsnight fucking have,
so what's the good news?

769
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:09,199
You were right, of course.
I have been checking the numbers.

770
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:11,279
You'd never know it from
the usual platforms.

771
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:13,719
The hate for you there is growing,
if anything.

772
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:15,880
But across all social and polling...

773
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:18,560
...your numbers are up.

774
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:22,479
I'm not talking about a spike,

775
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:25,479
but if you analyse the timeline from
the racial profiling comments,

776
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:28,159
the lovechild allegations,
the anti-media rant,

777
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:30,999
your approval is on a slow
but steady uptick.

778
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,360
Aliza, someone's trying
to destroy me.

779
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:36,679
Destroy you?

780
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:38,440
Tell your approval ratings that.

781
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:43,279
Isaac?

782
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:46,120
Mr Turner?
Would you like to follow me to set?

783
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:26,639
Zac, just so you know, mate, it's
the headlines on the hour as usual,

784
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:29,799
and then we're straight on to you.
London floor is live.

785
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:32,279
Good Morning. The G7 summit,
due to take place...

786
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:34,999
You're having quite a week.
Salford studio, 20 seconds.

787
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,879
We were debating whether
to go with car crash,

788
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:38,039
dumpster fire or shits how.

789
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:40,199
CHUCKLING

790
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:42,879
Studio live in ten, nine...

791
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:45,359
My mistake. Standing by.

792
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:47,839
And some breaking news.

793
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:52,519
Lawyers acting on behalf of Nigerian
care worker Victoria Bello say

794
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:56,239
that a DNA test to determine whether
former Security Minister

795
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:59,999
Isaac Turner is
the biological father of her child

796
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,480
has produced a negative result.

797
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:09,119
A surprising twist in
the continued saga of Isaac Turner.

798
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:11,199
Lawyers working on behalf of

799
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:14,559
the Bello family say they plan
to seek a second test.

800
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:18,119
We'll be back with more updates
throughout the morning.

801
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:21,080
Now, it's over to Lauren
and Will in our Manchester studio.

802
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:24,119
Morning, all. Good morning.

803
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:26,239
Well, the saga continues.

804
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:27,799
It certainly does here,

805
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:31,239
because first up on
the sofa today is the man who is,

806
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:33,039
or perhaps was,

807
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:37,199
at the heart of the so-called
Lagos lovechild allegations,

808
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:40,199
Isaac Turner. Welcome.

809
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:41,919
Good Morning.

810
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:45,079
Your paternity test has come back
negative. You must be delighted.

811
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:46,759
No, I'm not delighted.

812
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:50,199
I'm just... I'm glad this whole
silly sideshow is over.

813
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:53,519
I never actually heard you deny
the claims.

814
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:56,159
Well, you've seen the test results.

815
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:58,559
I have. I heard you deny them.

816
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:01,840
You uploaded a video, right,
saying you had nothing to hide?

817
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:08,999
Yeah. I-I felt it was important
to reassure the public.

818
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,559
Is that what you meant by
"The truth is coming?"

819
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:14,119
You know, Lauren,

820
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:17,359
my family and I have been
the target of some

821
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:20,719
pretty nasty lies.
Those lies have now been exposed,

822
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:23,559
so, hopefully, everyone can go back
to something like normal life.

823
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:26,239
Why do you think she made
those claims?

824
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:28,519
She must have known
the DNA test would fail.

825
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:31,279
I understand the burning ambition

826
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:34,159
people all over the world share
to come here to the UK.

827
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:37,759
Unfortunately, it does mean that
some people will go to desperate

828
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:40,319
lengths to jump the queue.

829
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:43,799
And, as the government said in
its manifesto,

830
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:47,199
our immigration system cannot be
fair if it's not firm.

831
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:48,679
Mm. Well,
as you brought up

832
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:49,959
manifesto promises,

833
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:51,399
and as you're no longer

834
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:52,639
at the Home Office,

835
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:54,519
has the government delivered on
that one?

836
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:56,479
Well, I think the Prime Minister

837
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:58,839
is laser-focused, rightly so...
PHONE BUZZES

838
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:01,479
...on the most pressing
global issues.

839
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:03,919
So you blame the Home Secretary,
then, your old boss?

840
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:06,520
ISAAC SCOFFS
You're putting words into my mouth.

841
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:13,199
Hello. Detective? I wasn't sure if
you'd be up. I'm...

842
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:15,839
I'm not sleeping an awful lot
at the moment.

843
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:18,919
It's hard to tell what's early
for other people.

844
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:22,879
You did say to call as soon as
I had something. Go on.

845
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:26,479
I was sceptical about Xanda's
unmasking feature.

846
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:28,799
Given we're dealing
with AI modelling,

847
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:31,959
I took their claims of
100% face-match accuracy

848
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:34,279
with a size able pinch of salt.

849
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:36,319
But...?

850
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:38,239
It's given us a face,

851
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,839
and I've run the search function.

852
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:42,120
And...?

853
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:47,559
Well, naturally, the program me can't
access the criminal databases you're

854
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:50,199
used to,
it can only find what's online.

855
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:51,720
Mr Knox, do we have a match?

856
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:55,199
Yes.

857
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:58,280
Looks like it's from some
corporate security website.

858
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:07,519
Nikolai Mirsky.

859
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:09,639
And that's about it.

860
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:11,719
His name and nationality.

861
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:14,640
How do you know his nationality?
The web page it came from.

862
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:17,520
Sending.

863
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:23,280
Languages aren't my forte, but...

864
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:27,160
...I know what Russian looks like.

865
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,199
Car won't be a minute.

866
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:39,519
Oh, Erm... That... How did it go?

867
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:43,479
Great. I mean, the result,

868
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:46,919
it came back negative?
That's what happened? Yeah.

869
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:49,040
And that's what's going out,
the same...?

870
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:53,719
They've booked you a late checkout.

871
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:56,799
Thought you might want to rest up
before heading home.

872
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:59,119
The room's yours if you want it.

873
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:00,400
Um...

874
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:11,879
The mini bars in each room are
fully complimentary.

875
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:14,599
Room service is 24/7. You'll find
the menus on the iPads,

876
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:16,879
and there's an entry phone by
the door to buzz them in.

877
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:19,560
Internet access is dead simple -
no code, just log straight on.

878
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:23,879
All right.

879
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:26,399
Oh. Uh, I'm so sorry. I don't...

880
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:27,920
No worries. That's all right.

881
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:54,480
PHONE RINGS

882
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:03,919
Hello?

883
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:05,800
Hello, Isaac.

884
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:09,719
Who's this?

885
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:12,719
You know who it is.

886
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:14,320
You did good today.

887
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:17,639
Carry on like that,
you won't even need me.

888
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:20,720
Listen, you AI robo fucks!

889
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:24,159
If you're listening,

890
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:26,080
leave me and my family
the fuck alone!

891
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:29,240
I understand you're upset.

892
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:32,479
But don't be.

893
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:34,160
I'm on your side.

894
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:36,960
What do you want?

895
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:39,960
I just want to talk.

896
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:43,639
We're talking.

897
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:46,399
No, not like this.

898
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:48,040
Face-to-face.

899
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:55,600
And how do you propose we do that?

900
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:01,640
Hello?

901
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:04,559
