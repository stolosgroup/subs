2
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:17,600
All clear, Ms. Kramer.

3
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:20,950
Four scans
and three weapon checks.

4
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:22,910
I like the way you think,
Agent Cooper.

5
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:25,390
Were you this serious
back at Fort Dakota?

6
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:27,910
The army fights
terrestrial threats, ma'am.

7
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,260
Here, it's that plus a little...

8
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:32,740
extra.

9
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:34,270
I know what you mean.

10
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:35,830
As for the added lockdown,

11
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:39,010
we're gonna need it for
what you proposing, ma'am.

12
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:07,560
The famous meta-human
Killer Frost

13
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:09,090
will be sentenced today...

14
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:10,650
So much for rebranding.

15
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,830
Cecile, how bad is this?

16
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:14,480
Uh, typically?

17
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:17,480
Frost's charges carry
a sentence of 10-20 years.

18
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:21,360
But... today Judge Tanaka
is gonna weigh that against

19
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,400
all the good
that she's done as a hero,

20
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:25,800
and given that Frost
hasn't committed a crime

21
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,580
in four years...

22
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,710
I could make a case for
a lighter sentence.

23
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,720
18 months,
maybe less with parole?

24
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,916
I mean she already pled
guilty and skipped her trial.

25
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:35,370
What more does the court want?

26
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:37,110
They want to know whether or not

27
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,070
you are responsible
for your crimes.

28
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,940
This is a load of crap.

29
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:43,290
You saved the city and more
lives than I can count.

30
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:45,160
Jitter's named a freakin' drink
after you.

31
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:46,820
Exactly. You know,

32
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:48,430
I say we just make like
"A Few Good Men"

33
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:50,340
and shove the truth down
the city's throat.

34
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:52,740
Guys, we're not looking for
a loophole.

35
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,780
I did these crimes.

36
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:56,650
And Caity, I know
you want to help,

37
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,740
but ever since becoming my own
person, I've realized that

38
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:02,050
if I don't own up
for my choices,

39
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:03,570
I'll never be able to move on.

40
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,880
What about all the good
things you've done?

41
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,320
Like the life we're building
together?

42
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,280
I'll miss you, too.

43
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:14,370
But... until I pay for
what I did,

44
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:16,800
the rest of the city won't look
at me the way you all do.

45
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,420
Isotopic signature detected.

46
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,330
- The Forces.
- One of them is close.

47
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:27,030
It's coming from Keystone City.

48
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,380
Seismic isotopes.

49
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:29,820
It's the Strength Force.

50
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,340
Barry, you have to go.

51
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:34,080
This is the chance
we've been waiting for.

52
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:36,130
- Listen to the cosmic lady...
- Go.

53
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:37,520
She's right.

54
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,780
If Fuerza's back,
people need the Flash.

55
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:41,220
We've got Frost's back.

56
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:43,270
- Iris is running comms.
- I'll come with you.

57
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:45,090
If that monster is here,

58
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:47,180
it won't be a match for us both.

59
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:01,200
You sure this is
the right location?

60
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,550
Yeah, satellites confirm it.

61
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:03,916
Fuerza should be
right in front of you.

62
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,460
Why? What are you seeing?

63
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:08,030
Either our satellites
need to be recalibrated or...

64
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:10,990
The Strength Force is better
at hiding than we thought.

65
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,260
- Keystone Cares...
- That's a nonprofit

66
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,740
that helps those those in need.

67
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,780
Why would Fuerza be there?

68
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:29,570
So, as you can see, Your Honor,

69
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:32,230
my client has already
demonstrated

70
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:34,360
that, despite her past mistakes,

71
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,930
Frost now only wishes
to serve this city,

72
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:41,720
alongside our greatest
protector, the Flash.

73
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,280
Still,

74
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:45,550
she's aware that justice
must be served.

75
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:49,030
Which is why she's seeking
a fair punishment.

76
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:51,290
Not only because
it's the right thing to do,

77
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:54,640
but to prove once and for all

78
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:57,340
who she really is.

79
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:59,340
She's a flawed person

80
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:01,170
who has changed her ways

81
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:04,650
and become a hero,
in her own right.

82
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,650
Well-argued, Ms. Horton.

83
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,310
Counselor Strong,

84
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:11,010
would the State like to make
an opening remark?

85
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,620
By her own admission,

86
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:17,880
the meta-human known as Killer
Frost is guilty of crimes

87
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:20,620
that have endangered
the peace of our city

88
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:22,930
and the safety of our citizens.

89
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:24,800
And the State
finds it absurd that

90
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:26,850
a former DA would romanticize
this narrative

91
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:29,630
to avoid punishment.

92
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,550
It's early and I haven't had
my coffee, Counselor.

93
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:33,990
But I don't believe
the defendant is

94
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:35,810
asking to avoid punishment.

95
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:38,160
Agreed, Your Honor.

96
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:41,340
But the State has one goal...

97
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:44,130
To ensure that this extremely
dangerous criminal

98
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:47,090
no longer threatens
our good citizens...

99
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:49,610
Which is why we believe

100
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:51,870
she must have her powers erased.

101
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:57,570
Your Honor,
that is highly irregular.

102
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:59,360
I'll decide that,
Ms. Horton.

103
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,230
Ms. Strong, please continue.

104
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:02,800
In lieu of prison,

105
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,800
the State moves to submit
alternate punishment...

106
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:09,760
That Killer Frost be compelled
by this court...

107
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,280
to take the meta-human cure.

108
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,390
Kramer is damn good.

109
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:30,390
We're here looking for a
lighter sentence.

110
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,650
She's arguing that since
felons are prohibited

111
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,570
from owning firearms,
Frost's powers are weapons

112
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:38,090
that the State can take away
using the cure.

113
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:41,400
A cure that CCPD only has
'cause we gave it to them.

114
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,620
A cure that's supposed to be
voluntary.

115
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:46,410
How can Kramer just force Frost
to take it like that?

116
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:48,580
- Is that even legal?
- Yeah, you would be surprised

117
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:50,646
what can become legal when
you've got the full force

118
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:52,500
of the American justice system
behind you.

119
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,720
It can be pretty scary
sometimes.

120
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:59,160
What if we forget the deal,
just take the 10 to 20 years?

121
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,770
Prosecution's not even
seeking jail time anymore.

122
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:03,290
Kramer is all about the cure.

123
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,730
She wants Frost neutralized
forever.

124
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:07,300
At least it can't get any worse.

125
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:10,040
Actually, it can.

126
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,016
I just talked to Mom.
She's gonna run some more tests

127
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,690
to be sure, but we think
that because you are

128
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:18,310
uniquely born from meta DNA,
if you take the cure...

129
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:20,610
It could harm you,
maybe even kill you.

130
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:24,230
- This is insane.
- Okay, no one is touching Frost.

131
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:26,050
- We're gonna stop this, right?
- Hell yeah.

132
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,530
Okay, we need to
fight fire with fire.

133
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:29,800
Hack Kramer, dig up dirt,

134
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,230
whatever it takes to save Frost.

135
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,710
- No.
- I didn't just turn myself in

136
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,630
so that I could go
and break the law again.

137
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:40,330
We're doing this by the book
or not at all... okay, Katie?

138
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,680
- Okay.
- You're right.

139
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:48,210
Something
still doesn't sit right.

140
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:51,210
Why would Kramer go so hard
to take you down?

141
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:54,560
I have no idea.

142
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,690
But all I care about now
is stopping her.

143
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:58,870
Well, we do that by
convincing the judge

144
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:01,570
that you deserve prison time
and not the cure.

145
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:03,960
I got some case law books
back at the office

146
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,010
that we need to
look at, and uh, Joe,

147
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:10,490
I think you can help me out.

148
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:20,930
Okay, what are we really doing?

149
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:23,630
- I like your hacking idea.
- We need to think bigger.

150
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,590
Frost's life is on the line.

151
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,810
Guys, I'm still picking up

152
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,550
Fuerza's isotopic signature
in the area.

153
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,860
You still don't see her?

154
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,340
No, nothing yet.

155
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:38,080
Fuerza's signature
is seismic-based.

156
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:40,780
Maybe she hides underground.

157
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:44,390
Man, there's a lot of
people here.

158
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,570
We should run them all away
before things get dangerous.

159
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:51,310
No. The Forces want to feed
off our powers, Barry.

160
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,450
That's probably why this thing
attacked you

161
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:55,580
in the first place.

162
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:58,620
Using our abilities too early,
even if it's to save others,

163
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:01,410
could put them in danger.

164
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:03,590
I guess that is possible.

165
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:05,890
There's still so much we don't
know about these Forces.

166
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:08,500
We know all we need to.

167
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:11,030
They're dangerous.

168
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,900
I still remember
how they attacked me...

169
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:15,770
Eating me alive.

170
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,560
I could feel it.

171
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,210
It's pure evil.

172
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,430
I know, I felt it too
when Psych attacked me.

173
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:24,430
Wherever these things came
from, they have to be stopped.

174
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,480
Yeah, I'm not so sure.

175
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,050
What do you mean?

176
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:30,180
Well, the Sage Force
is clearly dangerous

177
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:32,270
and Fuerza too,
but do you remember

178
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:34,660
what Chester and Cisco said
about Deon, the Still Force?

179
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,580
That he was just a kid
who wanted to be left alone.

180
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:38,946
Yeah, I mean,
does that seem like

181
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:40,206
a vicious energy feeder to you?

182
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:42,230
Something doesn't add up here.

183
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,686
Barry, the creature
that we're hunting

184
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:45,280
killed someone
and tried to kill you.

185
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,630
We can't let ourselves be
fooled by the

186
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:50,240
human facades these Forces
hide behind.

187
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,370
Underneath them, these Forces
only have one goal...

188
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:55,420
To destroy everything
they touch.

189
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:58,250
You need to remember that.

190
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,040
Barry, got another hit,

191
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,440
and it's coming from
the next tent.

192
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:23,880
Great, just put those
extra rations just over...

193
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:26,630
Wait, are you two volunteers?

194
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:30,630
Um... uh, no we're... uh,
no, actually.

195
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:35,160
No? Oh... sorry it's been
a pretty busy morning.

196
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,980
I'm Alexa Rivera,

197
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:39,030
the Field Supervisor
for Keystone Cares.

198
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:40,510
What can I do for you?

199
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,910
Mic check, one, two, one, two.

200
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:51,170
You ready?

201
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:53,520
Sure hope so.

202
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:58,000
Officer Korber,
I'm Caitlin Snow.

203
00:09:58,050 --> 00:09:59,750
I was
detained here the other day.

204
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:01,620
- It was a misunderstanding.
- Right, I heard.

205
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,660
- Sorry that happened.
- It's okay.

206
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:05,800
It's all sorted now.
But when the released me,

207
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,880
they didn't return
all of my belongings.

208
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:09,360
Really?

209
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:11,980
Yes, I'm still missing
a necklace,

210
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:14,370
and a bracelet... the bracelet
used to be my mother's.

211
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:16,240
I'm sure they're still
in lockup.

212
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,500
- Mm.
- If you just want to fill out

213
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:22,380
a 10-67 for loss of property.
I'll get them.

214
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:26,860
Great.

215
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:29,430
Cisco, is the coast clear?

216
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:32,910
I am back-looping security
cameras...

217
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:34,610
now.

218
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:37,000
You got two minutes
before they're back up.

219
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:40,700
- Which way am I going again?
- This whole breaking into

220
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,830
CCPD thing's freaking me out.

221
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,310
When we gave them the cure,

222
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,100
they stored the surplus
in the Armory.

223
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:48,360
- That's where you're headed.
- Uh...

224
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,230
Just turn right.

225
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,710
Your other right.

226
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,500
All right, you're gonna attach

227
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,500
the inertial oximeter
to the door.

228
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,890
It's gonna send out a pulse
that will neutralize

229
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,680
all cure samples on site.

230
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,030
Almost there.

231
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:07,330
Can I help you?

232
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:18,300
You seem lost.

233
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:19,740
I'm from "The Citizen."

234
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:22,310
I'm... I'm here for our interview.

235
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:24,846
Caitlin, Allegra needs backup.

236
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:26,010
Kramer's got her pinned.

237
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:31,660
Sorry about that.

238
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:41,630
No one told me about
any interview.

239
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:44,330
- They had to.
- I contacted your office.

240
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,070
They said you were in charge
of meta-affairs,

241
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:49,770
and, clearly,
you were never told.

242
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:51,640
No, I wasn't.

243
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,730
Okay, look, this is
a huge scoop for me.

244
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:57,300
Could you just give me
ten minutes?

245
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,480
How much time do I have left

246
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,960
before the cameras turn back on?

247
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,886
20 seconds. We have to
deliver the oximeter now

248
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:06,830
or we're screwed.

249
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:09,310
Please, if I go back
empty-handed,

250
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:10,880
my boss is gonna kill me.

251
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,970
Ten minutes,
that's all I'm asking.

252
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,500
You've got five.

253
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,670
- Thanks.
- Let's go sit.

254
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:34,380
Whoa, you should really
get that checked out.

255
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,860
Yeah, I'll have someone
take a look at it.

256
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,600
Ten seconds, go, go, go, go!

257
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:53,830
The cure has been neutralized.

258
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:57,970
Now get the hell out of there
before I have a heart attack.

259
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,150
Yeah!

260
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:10,540
Wait... so, am I under arrest?

261
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:11,810
No, no, no, no.

262
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:13,770
I... I am with CCPD,

263
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:15,200
but I... I'm a CSI,

264
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,030
I... I don't arrest people.

265
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:19,990
But you think I'm guilty
of something.

266
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:23,340
Right.

267
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:25,390
Never gonna catch a break, am I?

268
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,130
I'm sorry, I don't follow.

269
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:28,350
Okay, fine.

270
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,130
Yeah, it's true,
I was an addict.

271
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:32,870
Then I hit rock bottom,
and that was a wake-up call.

272
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:36,270
So I got clean,
I went to school.

273
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:37,456
I could have worked
in a hospital,

274
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,310
but this is where I belong.

275
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,050
Helping people, just like me,
turn their lives around.

276
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:46,906
Look, I've been to rehab,
and I don't have a record,

277
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:48,476
so whatever crime
you're investigating...

278
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,800
No, no, it's... it's... it's
nothing like that.

279
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:52,280
Um... uh, we...

280
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:56,240
Um...

281
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:58,330
It's... it's gonna sound

282
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:01,470
kind of crazy, but we've been
scanning the city

283
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:04,120
for a new meta,
and for some reason

284
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,560
our readings led us to you.

285
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,520
Seriously?

286
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,220
I'm not a meta.

287
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:16,050
We're not so sure.

288
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:18,570
Well, then what do you
want from me?

289
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:20,570
Alexa, we'd like for you
to come to

290
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:23,180
S.T.A.R. Labs with us.
We work with a team there

291
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:25,010
that can conduct a simple,
painless test...

292
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:26,790
Tell us what we already know.

293
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,516
That you're the monster
who attacked Central City

294
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:31,100
and killed a man
and tried to kill me too.

295
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:33,580
I have never seen you before
in my life,

296
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:34,906
and I'm not going anywhere
with you,

297
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:37,370
especially not S.T.A.R. Labs.

298
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:39,810
Yeah, I've heard of them.
They're the ones who started

299
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:41,306
all this meta stuff
in the first place.

300
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:42,696
Alexa, hold on,
we just want to help.

301
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,640
No, you hold on.

302
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:47,030
I am not a monster.

303
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,730
And if you don't mind,

304
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:51,820
there are people
who actually need my help.

305
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,690
Please don't contact me again.

306
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:04,596
I don't see why you're so upset.

307
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:05,960
We know that woman

308
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:07,206
is the thing
we've been searching for.

309
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:09,270
No, we think she might be.

310
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,466
But now we'll never
learn the truth,

311
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:12,140
because you scared her away.

312
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:14,710
- Barry, the answer is simple.
- If she won't come to us,

313
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,580
- we'll make her.
- What?

314
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:18,240
We move in the blink of an eye.

315
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,890
She'll never know,
and by the time she does,

316
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:23,500
we'll test her, and...
If she's innocent,

317
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:25,420
return her before she
takes her next breath.

318
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,160
Nora, I know
you're new to all this,

319
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,600
but we don't just grab people

320
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,950
and test them
against their will.

321
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:31,640
- Why not?
- Because...

322
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:32,706
- Lives are at stake.
- That's not how this works.

323
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:34,820
Well, maybe it should.

324
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:37,260
Barry, you and I know what this
thing is really capable of.

325
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,170
Now, all I'm asking is
for you to trust me

326
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:41,130
and do what needs to be done.

327
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:42,456
Is that really too much
for me to ask?

328
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,740
You're asking him to give up

329
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:45,480
a part of what makes hima hero.

330
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:48,960
So, yes, Nora, it is too much.

331
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:51,360
Barry.

332
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,530
It's your choice.

333
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:04,070
Captain West,

334
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:07,240
you're here to make a statement
on behalf of the Defendant.

335
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:08,460
If you please?

336
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:12,340
I admit, under oath,

337
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:16,170
that Frost hasn't always been
on the right side of the law.

338
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:18,820
But I can also say

339
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:21,210
that she has put her life
on the line

340
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:24,040
countless times to save others.

341
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:26,910
How so, Captain?

342
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:30,050
Frost has fought alongside
Earth's greatest heroes

343
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:31,570
to save the world, which means

344
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:34,920
that she's saved every person
in this room

345
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:37,530
including those
who want to lock her up

346
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:41,060
for being who she was.

347
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:45,150
Not for who she is today.

348
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:47,760
And,

349
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:50,680
Your Honor...

350
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,590
I don't understand
how this court

351
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:59,160
can force Frost
to take that cure

352
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:03,260
without sacrificing
what it stands for...

353
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,870
Justice.

354
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,740
Thank you, Captain West.

355
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:13,050
Your word goes a long way
in this court.

356
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:19,620
In fact,

357
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:22,320
I believe I'm ready
to deliver my verdict.

358
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,190
Your Honor.

359
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,906
We have a new update regarding
a relevant incident

360
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:29,800
that could affect your ruling.

361
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:30,940
If it pleases the court.

362
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:33,240
Proceed.

363
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:35,030
Earlier today, the meta-human
cure supply

364
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:37,250
at CCPD was rendered inert.

365
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:41,340
It is now completely unusable.

366
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:44,560
The State suspects foul play
by the only person with motive

367
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,860
for such bold treachery...
Killer Frost.

368
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:48,610
No, I didn't do it.

369
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,690
It wasn't me,
I have not been to CCPD.

370
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:52,870
- I've been here!
- Let me handle this, please.

371
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:55,830
Objection. Your Honor, this is
speculative nonsense.

372
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:57,610
Sustained.

373
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,400
Prosecutor, do you have
evidence for your accusations?

374
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,450
Yes, Your Honor.

375
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:04,530
CCPD security cameras
were hacked at

376
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:06,750
the exact moment
the cure was destroyed.

377
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,360
We wouldn't have found out
if not for

378
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:11,060
Ms. Kramer's expertise
in military intelligence.

379
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:13,540
She uncovered the hack herself.

380
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:20,590
It was me, Your Honor.

381
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,030
I did it, not Frost.
And I acted alone.

382
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:24,550
She's lying, Your Honor.

383
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,380
Killer Frost is clearly behind
this crime,

384
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:27,690
because her criminal past is

385
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:29,560
the same as her
criminal present.

386
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,186
I am not a criminal, what is
wrong with her, she keeps...

387
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:32,780
Order.

388
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,040
I said order.

389
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:37,220
Everybody sit down.

390
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:43,750
Now, Ms. Strong, considering
the cure isn't a viable option,

391
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,206
can the court assume
the State is no longer

392
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:47,190
seeking it as a punishment?

393
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:48,530
On the contrary.

394
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:55,800
And where exactly
did you get that?

395
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:58,200
My colleague Ms. Kramer
knows the magnitude of

396
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,890
the meta-criminal
we are dealing with.

397
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:02,770
So, she contacted A.R.G.U.S.
on behalf of the State

398
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:06,810
and had them replicate the cure
based on CCPD samples.

399
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:10,120
We should have 100 vials ready
by nightfall.

400
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:13,690
All we need is your decision,
Your Honor.

401
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:16,080
Very well.

402
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:18,830
I'll retire to my chambers
and make my decision.

403
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:20,480
Court is adjourned.

404
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,220
All rise.

405
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:35,190
This is for your own good.

406
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:40,720
What just happened?

407
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:43,850
We just lost.

408
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:53,430
Babe?

409
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:56,300
Please, tell us you know
a way out of this.

410
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:03,090
I'm sorry, but...

411
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:05,390
I don't.

412
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,286
I don't know... I don't know
how we're gonna keep Frost

413
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:09,270
from being forced
to take the cure.

414
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:11,140
What's Kramer's deal, anyway?

415
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:13,206
Kramer's had it out for me
since before I was arrested.

416
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:15,840
My gut tells me she's still
hiding something.

417
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,410
We need a miracle, and fast.

418
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:19,360
- No, we don't.
- Because we are Team Flash,

419
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:21,850
and we have more than enough
resources to figure this out.

420
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:23,386
Caitlin, we already went
that route, remember?

421
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:25,240
And all we did
was make things worse.

422
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,850
Okay, well I can't just sit
here and do nothing, okay?

423
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:29,550
Because Frost is my sister,

424
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:32,330
and I have to do everything
I can to protect her.

425
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,080
Guys, I need to talk to Caitlin.

426
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,300
Alone.

427
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,880
You want to explain yourself?

428
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,360
Caity, you made me a promise

429
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,280
that we would fight this
the way I wanted to.

430
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,686
Okay, but that's the thing,
okay...

431
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:03,320
You are not fighting this.

432
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:05,450
You skipped your trial,
and look how that turned out.

433
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,980
And whose fault is that?

434
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:14,680
It's Mom, she got the test
results back

435
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,290
from how the cure will affect
your meta-DNA.

436
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:20,340
Thank God,
she says you'll be fine.

437
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,990
The cure will take away
your powers,

438
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,860
but it won't harm you...
You're gonna survive.

439
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,870
Great, whatever.

440
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:31,610
Frost, this is the miracle
we've been waiting for.

441
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:33,260
This is gonna save you.

442
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:35,440
By erasing my powers?

443
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,270
You heard Cecile, okay.

444
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:41,400
Even if we can convince the
judge to give you prison time,

445
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:43,410
you're looking at
10 to 20 years easy.

446
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:45,230
Then I'll take it.

447
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,150
Why would you give up
two decades of your life

448
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:50,330
when there is a perfectly safe
solution?

449
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:53,240
Changing who I am
is not a solution.

450
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,160
How the hell can you even
ask me that?

451
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,720
You're the one who said the
cure should always be a choice.

452
00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:00,340
Then why won't you choose this?

453
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:04,990
I...

454
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:09,300
Do you remember when the
Sage Force attacked,

455
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:12,350
and I told you my greatest fear?

456
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:16,350
It's living life without you.

457
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:21,620
I am terrified of living a life
that you're not in.

458
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:25,230
Frost,
you are my sister, I love you.

459
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:28,360
And I cannot lose you.

460
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:34,330
And if I take the cure,
you will.

461
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:36,850
Caity, don't you see?

462
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:39,370
It's not me you trying
to protect.

463
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:41,590
It's yourself.

464
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:02,660
The Flash.

465
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:08,970
That CSI sent you, didn't he?

466
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:10,880
Alexa, I know everything
you've heard today

467
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:15,410
probably sounds insane,
let alone terrifying.

468
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:19,200
But, if you give me a chance,
I think maybe I can explain

469
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:23,290
why it's so important
you get tested.

470
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:25,460
I already know why.

471
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:42,220
You were there when Fuerza
attacked Central City.

472
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:47,660
I was part of a team

473
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:51,050
building low income housing
that week.

474
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:55,150
And I just remember
feeling so angry

475
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:58,060
when Abra Kadabra
destroyed our worksite.

476
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,460
But I don't remember much else.

477
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:09,900
I've been having, um...

478
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:12,340
blackouts.

479
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:15,770
Just waking up in strange
places, not knowing...

480
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:18,520
where I've been, or...

481
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:21,260
Or what I've done.

482
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,960
When's the last time
it happened?

483
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,260
When this thing attacked.

484
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:29,530
What if I...

485
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:32,700
Oh, my God, what if I am
this monster?

486
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:35,010
Help me find out.

487
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:36,840
Trust me,

488
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:41,800
I know how scary it is to not
have full control of yourself.

489
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:46,370
I haven't felt this way
since before I got clean.

490
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:48,420
I don't know
if I'm strong enough

491
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:50,680
to know the truth, I...

492
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:55,070
I just... I feel so weak.

493
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:07,520
Alexa, the person
who received these cards

494
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:09,740
is not a monster.

495
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:11,350
You've dedicated your life

496
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,310
to selflessly helping
those in need.

497
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:19,010
Finding out the truth about
yourself is the same thing.

498
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:21,540
You'll be keeping people safe.

499
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:31,110
I don't know why,

500
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:34,330
but I feel like I can trust you.

501
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:44,470
All right, Captain West.

502
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:47,340
Let's finish reviewing this
so we can...

503
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:52,040
Joe arranged a little
meet-cute for us.

504
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,570
You and Captain West

505
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:01,270
seem awfully close...
I wonder why that is.

506
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:03,710
We're poker buddies.

507
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:06,150
- What do you want?
- To know why you hate me.

508
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:10,590
Did I hurt you
or someone you love?

509
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:13,460
Then why do you want to take
my powers away?

510
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,890
How is that justice?

511
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:19,070
You've got a lot of gall
lecturing me about justice.

512
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,160
You only turned yourself in
after years of evading the law,

513
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:24,950
when you were surrounded
by my officers.

514
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:27,040
That's not doing
the right thing,

515
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,520
that's called getting caught.

516
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:31,210
Look, I'll go to prison,
do my time, fine.

517
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:33,650
But forcing the cure on me?

518
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,170
I don't deserve that.

519
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:38,830
And the court will decide
what you deserve.

520
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:41,960
This isn't just about what
you've done.

521
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:46,140
This is about what people
like you do.

522
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:47,400
Right.

523
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:49,360
So you hate all metas.

524
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:51,060
Very original.
Cicada with a badge.

525
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,980
I don't hate all meta-humans,

526
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:57,460
just the ones who pretend
to be heroes.

527
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:00,290
I lost an entire platoon

528
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:02,460
because I made that mistake.

529
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:04,420
On my orders,

530
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:07,550
they followed a meta I thought
was a hero into a hot zone.

531
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,170
He fooled me.

532
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:11,690
By the time I realized
his betrayal,

533
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:14,080
20 soldiers lost their lives,

534
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:16,220
lives I was responsible
to protect.

535
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,170
Never again.

536
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:23,400
This isn't just about me.

537
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:27,790
You want to go after
all meta-humans.

538
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,710
Only the criminals.

539
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:34,100
But your sentence will set
the legal precedent.

540
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:36,280
First you take the cure,

541
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,370
then any meta who endangers
the good of the people

542
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:41,720
will have to follow suit.

543
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:45,510
You cannot be serious.

544
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:48,070
I admire your fight.

545
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:51,600
But there is nothing
you can do to stop this.

546
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:54,510
'Cause in the end,
justice always wins.

547
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:15,410
You know, this whole waiting
for a verdict thing?

548
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:17,410
It sucks.

549
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:19,150
Frost, I am so sorry.

550
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:21,500
You're right, I wasn't thinking
about what you wanted.

551
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:23,410
I was only thinking about
what I wanted.

552
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:25,240
It doesn't matter.

553
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,770
Kramer's gonna win, and every
meta in this city

554
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:29,940
is gonna lose because of me.

555
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:35,730
Kramer's trying to set
a precedent that any meta

556
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:41,560
accused of a crime can be
punished with the cure.

557
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:44,700
I was just thinking about all
the meta lives that will hurt.

558
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:48,220
I don't even care about myself
anymore.

559
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:50,750
I just want to help them.

560
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:58,100
Hey...

561
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:03,710
Aren't you supposed to be the
one telling me not to worry?

562
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,670
That we'll figure it out?

563
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,810
That's the thing, Sis.

564
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:11,160
I think I just did.

565
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,260
Okay.

566
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,830
This place is even more
intimidating on the inside.

567
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:30,480
Alexa, I know you're nervous,

568
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,570
but the Flash promised
to keep you safe,

569
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:33,896
and we're gonna
keep that promise.

570
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,440
Barry's right.

571
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:37,880
And I'm sorry if I startled
you earlier.

572
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,490
But, don't worry.
If something goes wrong,

573
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:45,020
I'm sure the Flash will show up
and take care of everything.

574
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:47,410
Come with me.
The Speed Lab's this way.

575
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:56,460
It's been quite the long day,
but before I render my verdict,

576
00:29:56,510 --> 00:30:01,860
I understand the defendant
would like to make a statement.

577
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:04,820
You ready for this?

578
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,010
Here's the deal.

579
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:23,750
Taking away a meta-human's
powers

580
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:27,360
isn't the same thing as taking
away a gun from a criminal.

581
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:31,370
Erasing our powers
is erasing our identity.

582
00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:32,930
It's saying,

583
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:37,070
"Hey, you were
made bad, change that."

584
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:39,680
But shouldn't justice be about

585
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,330
changing the way a person acts,

586
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:45,030
not the way they were born?

587
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,470
I get it.

588
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:49,910
You fear us
because we're different.

589
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:53,040
You'd feel safer
if we were the same.

590
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:57,000
But different can't be cured.

591
00:30:57,050 --> 00:30:59,260
It's here to stay.

592
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:00,920
We're here to stay.

593
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:10,970
Some of you only think of me
as the criminal I used to be.

594
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:12,670
Back then, I was only
interested in

595
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:16,240
protecting myself.

596
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:20,940
But, then, I found someone else
worth protecting.

597
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:26,470
And protecting that person led
me to protecting a whole city.

598
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:28,770
And slowly I changed.

599
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,650
I learned how...

600
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:36,480
I learned how to be selfless
instead of selfish.

601
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:41,050
I learned that I'm my best self

602
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:44,530
when I'm protecting
other people.

603
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:52,140
So, with the help of someone
close to me,

604
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:54,930
I've made a decision.

605
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:10,860
I am submitting a request

606
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:14,170
for life in prison
without parole.

607
00:32:22,170 --> 00:32:25,870
Your Honor, prison time
is not the punishment

608
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,050
the State is requesting.

609
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:29,530
Correction, Your Honor.

610
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:32,270
The State's own words
made very clear

611
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:34,970
that their only goal was,
and I quote,

612
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:37,970
"to ensure this extremely
dangerous criminal

613
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:42,190
no longer threatens
our good citizens."

614
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,410
Are those your words, Counselor?

615
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,590
Yes, Your Honor.

616
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:50,380
Then I'll remind Ms. Kramer
she isn't Counsel,

617
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:53,730
and kindly ask her to sit down.

618
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:08,766
The court would like to
ask the defendant

619
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:12,050
if she's fully aware of what
she's proposing.

620
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:13,750
Yes.

621
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:16,580
I am.

622
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:20,190
As am I that my judgement
will set a precedent.

623
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:23,280
A ruling for the cure sets it
as a viable punishment.

624
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:26,280
A ruling against it
takes it off the table.

625
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:29,240
Like my old law professor
used to say,

626
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,720
in order for justice
to be blind,

627
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:36,510
sometimes she must open
her eyes to ugly truths.

628
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:38,380
Therefore,

629
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:40,600
I hereby sentence
the meta-human criminal

630
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:44,690
known as Frost,

631
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:48,000
to life in prison without
the possibility of parole.

632
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:14,810
Captain, uh,

633
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:17,250
I'm all packed up,

634
00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:18,990
just thought I'd say goodbye.

635
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:23,380
Good luck.

636
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:34,570
Listen, I know...

637
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:37,480
We've had our differences and
maybe that's an understatement,

638
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:42,270
especially after today, but...

639
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:47,490
I just wanted to tell you,
despite our personal frictions,

640
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:49,710
you have my respect.

641
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,190
I admire your commitment
to justice.

642
00:34:57,590 --> 00:35:00,330
The feeling's mutual.

643
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:03,120
Truth is, I may not always
like your methods.

644
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:05,770
Sometimes, I downright
despise them.

645
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:08,990
But I know a good cop
when I see one.

646
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:13,040
Only that's not all, is it?

647
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:15,960
No.

648
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,220
Make sure you're always checking

649
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:21,400
which side of the line
you're on.

So, I just lie here?

669
00:37:49,370 --> 00:37:51,590
Yeah, these arc radiators

670
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:53,680
emit isotropic energy.

671
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:56,200
I'll be using this tablet
to gradually expose you

672
00:37:56,250 --> 00:38:00,250
to those same isotopic waves.

673
00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:02,250
Are you okay?

674
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:04,520
- No.
- I'm scared out of my mind.

675
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,170
- You're gonna be fine.
- I promise.

676
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:11,040
So if you're right about
all this... won't I change?

677
00:38:11,090 --> 00:38:13,090
'Cause if that happens,
I could hurt someone.

678
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:14,700
You won't hurt anyone.

679
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:16,480
We're only administering
a tiny dose,

680
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:19,100
just enough to trigger
the smallest change inside you

681
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:20,790
on a microscopic level.

682
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,060
So if something...
is inside you,

683
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:24,450
our instruments will tell us.

684
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:31,540
Are you still sure
you wanna do this?

685
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:35,810
Ready?

686
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:37,940
- Yeah.
- Her baseline is steady.

687
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:54,480
What is it?

688
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:56,130
Nothing.

689
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:57,960
Just... the way
you inspired Barry

690
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,400
to reach out to Alexa.

691
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,790
You really are
his lightning rod.

692
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:17,980
Alexa... can you hear me?

693
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,290
Ruhh... raaahhh...

694
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,120
Get...

695
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:29,690
away... from...

696
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:31,390
aaahhhh!

697
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:39,000
Alexa?

698
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:44,530
Can you hear me?

699
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:47,310
Hey, it's okay.

700
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,360
- Everything's okay.
- No, I'm not, I'm not,

701
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,880
I'm not... I am that thing!

702
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:52,360
What am I gonna do now?

703
00:39:52,410 --> 00:39:53,996
- How am I...
- You're gonna be all right.

704
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:55,076
You're gonna be all right, okay?

705
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,500
You're safe here.

706
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:58,720
We're gonna help you
deal with this.

707
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,150
I promise.

708
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:18,170
Nora?

709
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:19,480
You still don't get it.

710
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,300
If I don't end her now,

711
00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:22,586
she'll sacrifice me
to get what she wants...

712
00:40:22,610 --> 00:40:23,920
My life.

713
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,740
Wait, listen to me.

714
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:27,480
I know you're scared.

715
00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:30,710
- We can still help her.
- You should be helping me.

716
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:33,800
I need your powers to defeat
her, and you promised.

717
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:36,360
And now you're breaking
that promise.

718
00:40:36,410 --> 00:40:39,020
And I know why.

719
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:42,150
You may be his lightning rod...

720
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:44,460
but I'm the lightning.

721
00:41:14,490 --> 00:41:15,790
Thank you.

722
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,870
Time to choose a side, Barry.

722
00:41:45,305 --> 00:42:45,476
