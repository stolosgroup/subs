2
00:00:15,932 --> 00:00:16,933
Hmm.

3
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:19,728
Ah…

4
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:21,104
Who did that?

5
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:27,026
I did.

6
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:33,658
Somebody's screwing with ya.

7
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:36,286
Check that thing's ass
for a "made in China."

8
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:39,622
- No way that's me. Cheap knockoff.
- How do you know?

9
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:42,167
'Cause I would've swallowed
your baby boy whole

10
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,626
and shit him out in pieces.

11
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,390
Let's take those shackles off
and find out.

12
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,421
Brandon.

13
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,051
<i>He's not even close to being ready.</i>

14
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:53,678
<i>Maybe he never will be.</i>

15
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:57,849
Shouldn't he be locked up for what he did
to whatever the hell this is?

16
00:00:57,932 --> 00:00:59,392
Put him back in Supermax.

17
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:02,520
Oh, I see how it is. Rules don't apply
when it's your kid doing the killing?

18
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:03,730
Get him out of here.

19
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:05,940
Double standards
don't look good on you, pal!

20
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:07,567
That's some screwed-up shit!

21
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:11,279
You think people ain't gonna notice?
I got a fan club, asshole!

22
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:15,492
Jesus Christ,
that guy's got a mouth on him.

23
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,368
He always has.

24
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:19,245
This one never said a word.

25
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:22,290
No, he didn't.

26
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:30,047
What do you think?

27
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:34,344
Clone? Parallel dimension?
Some kind of a shapeshifter?

28
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:38,264
Whatever it is, we need answers.

29
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:40,934
Gonna need to cut him open to get them.

30
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:37,323
If Blackstar didn't escape,
who did you fight in Nebraska?

31
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:38,908
We're investigating the situation.

32
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,302
- Lady Liberty!
- Yes.

33
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:42,829
What steps are being taken
to secure the Supermax?

34
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:44,873
There is no indication
of a security breach.

35
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:47,083
Wherever
the second Blackstar originated from,

36
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,710
it was not the Supermax.

37
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:50,503
- Yes?
- There's been reports

38
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:53,256
of massive reprisals
from several supervillain groups.

39
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:54,939
Is this something your team is aware of?

40
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,302
We're in contact
with state and federal authorities.

41
00:02:57,385 --> 00:02:59,429
If we find any indication
of an ongoing threat...

42
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:00,513
Where's Paragon?

43
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:03,016
Paragon is in the process
of an after-action debrief.

44
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:04,809
Does he have a statement?

45
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:06,811
Yes.

46
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:08,855
Paragon wishes to express his regret

47
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:10,940
that the life
of a hostile combatant was lost,

48
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,317
regardless of the circumstances.

49
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,278
The latest option poll
suggests 78% of Americans

50
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:17,572
support your son's execution
of a supervillain.

51
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:20,533
Do you think your old-fashioned ideas
of just tossing them in prison

52
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:23,098
- is becoming a threat to public safety?
- The Union thinks...

53
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:26,539
If that's true,
78% of my fellow Americans need to think

54
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:28,833
about what kind of a country
they wanna live in.

55
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:32,462
Lethal force
without due process is not justice.

56
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:35,423
But how are you gonna protect us
from supervillains?

57
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:56,361
Your grandpa saw that,
he'd set off fireworks.

58
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,534
Brandon, I know
it hasn't been easy being my son.

59
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,372
Growing up
with the public constantly watching you,

60
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:09,255
looking up at you
and wanting to tear you down

61
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,458
all in the same breath.

62
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:15,797
Brandon, what you did to Blackstar
you can't take back.

63
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:17,589
Blackstar?

64
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,886
Everything you do
is a reflection on this family.

65
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:25,932
We have to be the ideal.
<i>You </i>have to be the ideal.

66
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:30,395
Chloe didn't even show up
when Blackstar was tearing up Nebraska.

67
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:31,598
I'm not talking about Chloe.

68
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:33,022
She's drunk or high half the time,

69
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,106
and I'm the one
not living up to your expectations?

70
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:37,777
- Don't talk about your sister like that.
- Like what?

71
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,364
Like the way she talks
about everyone else in this family?

72
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:42,907
Yes.

73
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:46,077
Stop lowering yourself every time
somebody pisses you off. Be better.

74
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:48,705
My friends were dead.

75
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:52,458
I had to make a choice
between Blackstar and you.

76
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,294
Dad!

77
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:57,130
<i>I chose you, Dad.</i>

78
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,550
And I'd choose you every time.

79
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:04,345
Wouldn't you do the same?

80
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:09,309
You're gonna be here long after I'm gone.

81
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:14,272
And one day, God willing,
you're gonna be the Utopian…

82
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,818
And every evil you can imagine
is gonna rise up against you,

83
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:20,403
against mankind,

84
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:24,157
and not for justice, for vengeance.

85
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:25,825
And in those moments,

86
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:30,955
the only thing that you will have
to guide you is the Code.

87
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,250
It has to stand, Brandon, even if we fall.

88
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:43,343
So, what? I should've just let
Blackstar slaughter us?

89
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:44,927
Killing is never the answer.

90
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:47,764
Why don't you tell that
to my friends we're burying?

91
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:58,375
There's always another way
to get the job done, Brandon. Always.

92
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:00,193
Except I can't shoot fire
from my eyes, Dad.

93
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:01,611
Not yet, you can't.

94
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:06,115
Look, if what I say or do, it hurts you,
I'm sorry.

95
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:11,339
But one day, you're gonna be stronger
than anyone else in the world,

96
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:13,164
including me.

97
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:18,836
All right, Brandon.

98
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:22,840
Stay out here on the farm
until things quiet down.

99
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:24,842
- Clear your head.
- You're grounding me?

100
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:26,177
I'm not grounding you, Brandon.

101
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,179
No, Dad. This is bullshit.

102
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:31,432
Have you seen
what the supervillains are doing?

103
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:33,601
Work the farm, stay out of sight.

104
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:35,812
No uniform, no patrol
until I give the okay.

105
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:36,979
Do you understand?

106
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:41,567
- Do you understand?
- Yes, sir.

107
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:48,449
It's not a punishment, Brandon.
It's an opportunity. Use it.

108
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,547
We're up to our necks,

109
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,924
and you stop by the cleaners
before coming in?

110
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,636
It's Dad's suit, for the funeral.

111
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,515
It's a closed casket, for Christ's sake.
No one's gonna know.

112
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:14,350
Yeah, well, I'll know.

113
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:21,732
All right, let's see
how we're wrapping Pop

114
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:23,818
for the big send-off.

115
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:32,160
The Kuppenheimer.

116
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,457
- He'll look good in that.
- Yeah.

117
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:41,127
But let's change the tie.

118
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:44,630
No, he loved that tie.

119
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:47,133
He hated it.

120
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:48,885
He wore that tie all the time.

121
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,970
Yeah, 'cause you gave it to him.

122
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,063
That's his huckleberry, right there.

123
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:05,359
Went on the second your ass hit the door.

124
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,112
He told me this was his favorite tie.

125
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,656
Yeah, he said a lot of things, Shel.

126
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,172
Uh…

127
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,676
I spoke with the board.

128
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:34,096
They wanna shut it all down.

129
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:37,141
What? They can't do that.

130
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:38,225
Yeah, they can.

131
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:42,438
- We have to talk to them.
- I've been talking to them, Shel.

132
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:43,642
Dad would never put our men…

133
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:44,941
- He's dead.
- I don't care.

134
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:47,193
We are not putting our guys…

135
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:51,030
- What?
- Excuse us! Please.

136
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:53,282
- Can we have a minute?
- Not a good time, Willie.

137
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,326
We've got something
we think you ought to see.

138
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:57,494
What is it?

139
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:02,999
Shel?

140
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,128
They're saying Dad ripped off the workers.

141
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,421
Son of a bitch.

142
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:09,590
Where's G. Kennedy?

143
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:11,341
Where is he?

144
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:14,845
I wanna talk to the scumbag
who wrote this garbage!

145
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:17,431
I'm the scumbag you're looking for, pal.

146
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:18,558
You're G. Kennedy?

147
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:19,809
I stutter? Who are you?

148
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,686
Lawyer, I'm guessing, by the suit.

149
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:25,106
"Chester Sampson
gambled his workers' pensions on expansion

150
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:28,568
and lost it all in the market crash."
How can you make up lies like this?

151
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:32,029
There's not a word in there
that isn't the God's honest.

152
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:33,781
Everything is double-sourced,

153
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:35,408
- top to bottom.
- Top to bottom.

154
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:38,035
So you can run back
to whoever's trying to rattle me

155
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:39,495
at Sampson Steel,

156
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:44,041
and you can tell them that Grace Kennedy,
she doesn't get rattled, ever.

157
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:47,753
My father would never do
any of the things that you say here.

158
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:48,921
Oh, shit.

159
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:50,881
I'm sorry for your loss.

160
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:55,052
Oh, you're sorry for my loss?
I guess my loss is your gain, right?

161
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:59,557
"The death of capitalism."
That is one hell of a headline.

162
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,810
Well, guess what,
you rotten little Marxists?

163
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:05,062
Capitalism made this building!

164
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,482
It made your homes, and it made your cars!

165
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:10,443
And my father made the steel

166
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:14,322
that built everything that makes
this country the greatest in the world!

167
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:17,658
And what do you do, huh? What do you make?
What do you… what do you contribute?

168
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:20,536
You lurk behind your ink
and your newsprint,

169
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,787
wagging your little finger

170
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:23,831
while you drag a good man's name
through the muck!

171
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:25,708
And he was a good man!

172
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:30,921
What have you built, huh?
How are you helping America?

173
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:32,590
Your nose is bleeding.

174
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:40,222
You should be ashamed of yourself,
all of you.

175
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,197
Thought you went home.

176
00:10:58,949 --> 00:10:59,949
You all right?

177
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:02,118
Yeah.

178
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:06,624
Did you ever lose anybody
back when you were a superhero?

179
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,169
No.

180
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:19,552
Were you afraid?

181
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:22,555
Yeah.

182
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,350
Did you run?

183
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:27,395
No, of course not.

184
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,773
So you stayed, and you fought?

185
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:32,650
Yeah, I got a couple of hits in, but...

186
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:34,819
I'm not talking about fighting Blackstar.

187
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:36,505
I'm talking
about fighting through the fear.

188
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,572
- It wasn't enough.
- It never is.

189
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:41,158
- Petra, I know you don't...
- I'm not you.

190
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:44,203
I can't keep taking hits
and just get back up.

191
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,997
I can't watch my friends die
because of some asshole.

192
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:52,253
The supervillains
are going crazy out there.

193
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:54,964
Guys who robbed banks before
have been killing people.

194
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,300
I can't.

195
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:02,346
What if this is just the start of it?

196
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:06,225
I don't know if I can do this
when things are this insane.

197
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:07,893
Then don't.

198
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:16,152
I never asked you
to follow me into this game.

199
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:22,158
Hell, I'm surprised you wanted to,

200
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:25,536
after all the foolish shit
I got up to when you were little.

201
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:29,415
I was worried you weren't ready,

202
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:32,042
that you'd get yourself hurt…

203
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:34,795
Bad, like I did.

204
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:41,343
But here you are,
and I couldn't be prouder.

205
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:44,972
For not getting killed?

206
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:52,313
For being better than me… in so many ways.

207
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:22,008
Are you okay?

208
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:23,844
Yeah, I'm fine.

209
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:31,060
I got bagels
from that place you like in New York.

210
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,570
I can't have gluten.
I have a shoot coming up.

211
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:40,361
Can I use your toaster?

212
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:53,665
Thank you.

213
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:59,964
You don't eat them,
I'll just throw them at the gulls.

214
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:01,590
Keep me awake half the night.

215
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,718
I thought gulls slept
when the sun went down.

216
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:07,555
My night, their day.

217
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:11,057
Oh.

218
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,185
So, what kind of shoot is this one?

219
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:18,524
Long, conservative dresses
with wholesome scenery?

220
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,153
It's a joke, Chloe.

221
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:25,489
Why are you here?

222
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:36,458
Are you coming to the funeral?

223
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:41,005
- You want me there?
- Of course I want you there.

224
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:44,925
Brandon could use your support.
He's really struggling right now.

225
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,805
Well, what am I gonna say to him?

226
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:54,184
I don't know, but he'll listen to you
before he'll listen to me or your mom.

227
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:59,815
I tried talking to him about what happened
with Blackstar, but I just…

228
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:02,443
I don't know. I… I…

229
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:08,198
You try to say the right thing,
the thing you think he needs to hear,

230
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:09,325
but it just all…

231
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:14,997
I just… I can't get through to him.

232
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:17,875
Just give him some time.

233
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:25,174
You know, he was tight with Barry
since… junior high.

234
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:29,302
Barry Bishop.

235
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:34,016
Brandon's the godfather
to his little girls.

236
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:34,975
Oh.

237
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:36,518
Oh yeah… Oh, Tectonic.

238
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,692
There you have it, Dad.

239
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:46,235
That…

240
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:50,950
That is why I'm here,
halfway across the country.

241
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:53,077
That is why Brandon's a mess.

242
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,246
Because you could never stop being
the Utopian long enough

243
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,874
to really be there for either of us.

244
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,878
- That's just not fair, Chloe.
- You wanna talk about what's fair?

245
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:05,965
The suit and cape are the real you, Dad…

246
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:10,009
Not this.

247
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:12,398
Honey, I didn't come here
to fight with you.

248
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:14,390
I know you didn't, okay?

249
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:16,016
But you can't stop.

250
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:18,811
If it's not how I look,

251
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:21,480
it's how I dress, or who I'm dating,

252
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:23,357
or how I'm reflecting on you

253
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,734
if I don't show up
to a fight or a funeral,

254
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:28,362
or any other thing that's me, Dad.

255
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:33,951
You have been attacking me for so long,

256
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:37,538
I don't know
how to do anything but fight you.

257
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:47,297
Chloe, we're bigger than this, both of us.

258
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:48,674
We're just us.

259
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:51,885
The only way out of the loop is

260
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:57,808
for me to stop being me,
or you to stop being you.

261
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:04,648
Wait, that's just a, a lose-lose.

262
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:08,444
That's a great framing device
for unaccountability.

263
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:14,616
Chloe, we are our own worst enemies,
both of us.

264
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:17,161
But every time
I try to propose a solution,

265
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:19,580
it becomes, by default,
just another attack.

266
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,541
I'm not trying to attack you, Chloe.

267
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:26,754
If you would just stop pointing fingers
for once and start...

268
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,510
Yeah.

269
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:55,532
I don't know. Okay.

270
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:59,286
Are you gonna make it to the funeral?

271
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:03,791
It would mean a lot to me.

272
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:06,334
I don't know.

273
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:13,050
Well, bagels will keep in the freezer
for after the shoot.

274
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:54,859
What's the name of that guy from Legal?
Bieder-something?

275
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:57,177
- Biederbeck.
- Biederbeck, that's it.

276
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:59,012
What are you doing?

277
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:01,181
We are gonna sue Grace Kennedy
and her socialist rag

278
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:02,349
into the goddamn ground.

279
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:04,226
Put the phone down.
We're not suing anyone.

280
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:06,687
We are not letting
these people spread lies about Dad.

281
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:07,770
It's true!

282
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:11,984
Everything they wrote.

283
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:22,703
I checked the numbers
and confirmed it with the bank.

284
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:28,333
He used the pension fund
to back the expansion.

285
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,002
Oh my God!

286
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:32,421
It's gone, all of it.

287
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:35,174
Check it again.

288
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:36,609
- Shel...
- Check it again.

289
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:40,554
You made a mistake, or the bank did.
Dad would never do something like that.

290
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:43,265
You've got no goddamn idea, do you?

291
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:48,437
Walking around
in a cloud of Dad's bullshit

292
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,606
about building homes and families.

293
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:55,527
This is steel.

294
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:01,158
What we have, we clawed
from Carnegie and Rockefeller.

295
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:05,996
You think that happens
without getting your hands dirty?

296
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:12,586
Republic, and Bethlehem, and U.S. Steel
tried to put us in the ground every day

297
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:15,505
since these walls went up,
and every day, we stopped it.

298
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,508
We gave as good as we got…

299
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:20,844
…sometimes better.

300
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:22,596
Me and Dad.

301
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:25,599
And now it's just me.

302
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:30,020
I've worked here since I was 15 years old.
Don't you dare...

303
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:32,564
Yeah, you worked here.
I lived here.

304
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,399
While you've been picking ties

305
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:37,236
and going off like a lunatic
in front of the press,

306
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:38,904
I've been trying to keep what we built

307
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:41,698
from disappearing
in a puff of goddamn smoke.

308
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:46,411
And since you weren't around,
I went ahead, and I spoke with the board.

309
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:49,957
The only way we can hold on
to what's left of our assets

310
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,834
is to shut down production,
at least for five months.

311
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,753
We are not putting those guys
on the street.

312
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:57,798
- We are. We are, Shel.
- Walter, we are not. We are not doing it!

313
00:20:57,881 --> 00:20:58,882
We are!

314
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:07,015
<i>Explain!</i>

315
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,559
Hold on.
I'm figuring this out as soon as I can.

316
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:10,477
You owe us!

317
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,604
Hold on! Hold on!

318
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:16,566
Yes, the mill is closing, but I promise
I'm gonna get it back up and running...

319
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,860
- To hell with your promises!
- What about our pensions?

320
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,697
Your pensions, I'm gonna get them
back to you as soon as I can.

321
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,324
Get the hell back!

322
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:27,577
Hold on one second. Listen, I'm...

323
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:29,871
- You taking his side, Willie?
- We ain't taking shit!

324
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:33,166
And we ain't going to jail
for beating up some rich kid, either.

325
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,585
They're gonna need you at home,

326
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:38,338
not rotting away in some jail cell.

327
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:40,590
- What if it just makes me feel better?
- It won't.

328
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:45,053
Come on, clear out your lockers
and go home to your families.

329
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,489
- We'll make this right.
- Go on.

330
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:48,473
I hope it's a real nice wedding, Shel.

331
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:51,852
Really nice.

332
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:07,658
Hmm.

333
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:09,870
Put him in a suit.

334
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:11,913
Put him in a tie.

335
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:15,709
Put him in a box.

336
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:21,965
"Everything ends up in a box."

337
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:30,807
He said…

338
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:33,435
He said, "I'll be right down."

339
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:38,357
"Right down,"
like it's some kind of a goddamn joke.

340
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:41,526
But I'm a…

341
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:46,448
I'm a dozen feet away, and I… I…

342
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,326
I just stand there.

343
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:01,254
Listen to me.

344
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:04,674
You couldn't save him.

345
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:11,848
You could not save him.

346
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:24,027
- Hey, honey, you ready?
- Just about.

347
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:28,949
What's going on with that tie?
You need some help?

348
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:30,574
Come here.

349
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:38,917
I can't do this.

350
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:40,585
Yes, you can.

351
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:44,756
I… I don't know what to say.

352
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,882
You do know.

353
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:48,802
You just speak from your heart.

354
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:54,141
But, you know,
fear is a part of everything,

355
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:56,893
but so is getting through it.

356
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:00,856
<i>Lord Jesus Christ,</i>

357
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:03,108
by your three days in the tomb,

358
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:06,695
you hallowed the graves
of all who believe in you

359
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:09,239
and made the grave a sign of hope

360
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:14,161
that promises resurrection
even as it claims our mortal bodies.

361
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:19,207
Grant that your children may sleep here
in peace

362
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,669
<i>until you awaken them to glory,</i>

363
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:25,881
<i>for you are the resurrection and the life.</i>

364
00:24:27,757 --> 00:24:29,885
Then will they see you face to face,

365
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:33,388
and in your light, will see light

366
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:38,018
and know the splendor of God,
for you live…

367
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:39,144
Sheldon?

368
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:42,772
I don't think she's coming.

369
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:46,109
<i>It's funny.</i>

370
00:24:46,776 --> 00:24:49,446
You never really know anybody
until they're gone, do you?

371
00:24:50,947 --> 00:24:52,949
That's when it's all stripped away, the…

372
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:57,662
The lies that… that…
that hold you together, that blind you,

373
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:59,247
blind you from seeing…

374
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:03,417
Sheldon?

375
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:07,130
…the truth… …you don't wanna see.

376
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:08,048
Shel?

377
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:11,510
Sheldon!

378
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:18,350
- Sheldon!
- Somebody get a doctor!

379
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:23,480
Then will they see you face-to-face

380
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:26,316
and know the splendor of God.

381
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:28,944
- Amen.
- Amen.

382
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:49,005
Today we bury my friends.

383
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:51,675
I knew them as Briggs,

384
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:54,843
Vera,

385
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:58,722
and Barry.

386
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:05,313
They weren't their powers.
They weren't their uniforms.

387
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:06,439
They were people.

388
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:09,359
And I'm sorry they're gone.

389
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:14,614
I'm sorry I failed them.

390
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:16,866
I'm sorry I couldn't do more,

391
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:19,327
couldn't <i>be </i>more.

392
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:26,543
We're all reaching for something,
and we keep falling short of it.

393
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:30,672
But not Briggs,

394
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:33,466
not Vera and not Barry.

395
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:36,845
They achieved it.

396
00:26:39,055 --> 00:26:40,098
They died heroes.

397
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:44,603
And I envy them.

398
00:26:45,228 --> 00:26:47,308
- So sorry.
- Thank you for coming.

399
00:26:47,647 --> 00:26:49,357
- Thank you.
- Say hello to your mom.

400
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:55,488
Hey. You did good out there, B.

401
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,825
How you doing? You okay?

402
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:01,703
She's alive. That's how.

403
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:05,290
I won't forget
the reason she's still here.

404
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:07,917
You did the right thing.

405
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:11,338
Thank you.

406
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:12,421
Bye.

407
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:29,272
How are they holding up?

408
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:34,027
They saw Barry.
They saw it on the news, and

409
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:38,114
- they didn't blur it out or cover it up.
- Jesus.

410
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:42,952
I want them to forget. Ask your uncle?
He can go inside their heads and erase it.

411
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:45,747
Like they never saw it.
They won't have to remember him that way.

412
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:46,830
Karen,

413
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:48,917
he doesn't do that,

414
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:51,294
especially not to kids.

415
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:54,339
Excuse me. Mrs. Bishop.

416
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:57,384
Sorry to bother you, ma'am.

417
00:27:57,967 --> 00:28:00,887
Boys over at the precinct
took up a collection.

418
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:03,014
- Uh, it ain't much, but, uh…
- Thank you.

419
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:05,892
Least we could do.

420
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:11,969
Anything you need, Karen,
you let me know, okay?

421
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:23,660
There's too many funerals.

422
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:25,412
Us and you.

423
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:28,415
We're doing our best.

424
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:30,709
I know you guys are too.

425
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:34,212
Eh, there's doing,
and then there's getting it done.

426
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:37,716
Ought to line them all up,
pop them one by one,

427
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:39,968
just like you did Blackstar.

428
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:42,929
Hole in the head. Problem solved.

429
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:54,774
Half the people were patting him
on the back for killing Blackstar.

430
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:59,404
Fitz too.
He wasn't even trying to hide it.

431
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:01,823
How about that cop
that Brandon was talking to?

432
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:04,117
These guys
are supposed to be upholding the law,

433
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,162
not campaigning for mass executions.

434
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:13,251
- I thought we were having a conversation.
- Oh.

435
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:17,338
You were handling it fine by yourself.
You're good at that.

436
00:29:18,673 --> 00:29:20,258
I'm not Walt. I can't read your mind.

437
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:23,621
I don't know. What do you want, Sheldon?
The world isn't the way you want it to be.

438
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:26,222
You made that pretty clear
at the press conference.

439
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:27,891
I couldn't stand there anymore, Grace.

440
00:29:27,974 --> 00:29:29,535
These people have no idea
what they're asking.

441
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:32,896
You cannot control everything!
You have to stop.

442
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:36,232
I mean, if you clamp down on this
the way you clamped down on the kids...

443
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:38,151
We don't kill, ever, no exceptions.

444
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:39,914
You know what?
If there weren't exceptions,

445
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:41,946
we wouldn't be having
this conversation right now,

446
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:43,908
because we'd be buried
next to Brandon's friends.

447
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:57,545
Sheldon, the supervillains
are changing the rules.

448
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:08,223
I don't know why the hell
they can't have a nurse in here

449
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:09,432
to keep an eye on him.

450
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:11,309
We're paying them enough.

451
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:13,228
I could do with a nurse or two myself.

452
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:17,065
Can you shut it off for five minutes,
Hutchence? This isn't a joke.

453
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:19,692
I wasn't joking.
I could use a nurse.

454
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:25,031
- When's the last time a doctor came by?
- An hour ago.

455
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:27,909
Yes, and he said the same thing
as the last one an hour before that.

456
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:31,913
If there was something they could do,
they would do it. We just have to wait.

457
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:34,916
You have to do that on his bed?
Go play on a table.

458
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:37,085
I don't tell you
to stop wearing a hole in the floor.

459
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:38,711
You don't tell me where to play cards.

460
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:41,214
Get those cards off his bed,
or I'll do it for you.

461
00:30:41,297 --> 00:30:44,133
You try it, and I'll throw you
out the goddamn window.

462
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:45,217
George!

463
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:47,011
Sorry, Jane.

464
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:55,144
No, Dad!

465
00:30:57,605 --> 00:30:58,857
<i>Find the boat.</i>

466
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:02,443
<i>Gather your crew.</i>

467
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:03,528
Sheldon. Sheldon?

468
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:12,370
<i>Sail to the island and save America.</i>

469
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:15,498
Get the doctor. Go!

470
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:17,876
Okay. All right.
You're in the hospital. All right?

471
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:20,628
You had a seizure at the service.

472
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:25,258
I'm alive?

473
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:27,635
You gave us a good scare,
I'll tell you what.

474
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,554
You're here.

475
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:32,390
You're with us, all right?
You're in the hospital.

476
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:37,228
I saw something.

477
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:38,854
What did you see?

478
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:40,898
An island.

479
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:43,234
<i>I think it was…</i>

480
00:31:45,194 --> 00:31:48,323
I think it was some kind of a m… message.

481
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:51,910
A message?

482
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:55,538
A message from who, Shel?

483
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:00,376
From Dad.

00:32:01,305 --> 00:33:01,413
