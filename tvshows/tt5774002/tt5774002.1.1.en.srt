Yeah!

4
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:20,645
- You're too slow.
- I'll get you now.

5
00:00:21,312 --> 00:00:23,023
I'm more powerful than you.

You have to catch me first, Utopian.

No, I didn't.

Chloe?

18
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:23,500
- Brandon, he lied.
- It's okay. It's okay.

19

Hi, Dad.

- We were playing, and Chloe...
- Yeah, I heard.

24
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:49,734
You used your powers, Chloe.

25
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:57,450
He was the bad guy.
We're supposed to get the bad guy.

26
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:59,369
We have these powers for a reason.

27
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:01,204
And with great power comes...

28
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:02,789
Great responsibility.

29
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:03,872
No.

30
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:07,210
Well, yeah.

31
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:11,798
Look, you have to care.
You have to care about people.

32
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:14,342
You have to care about everything.
You have to know that…

33
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:21,516
Look, it's easier to hurt people,
to get angry, to even kill people.

34
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,433
But the bad guys...

35
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:23,977
The bad guys are people too.

36
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:28,356
So what do we do?
We stop them, and we lock them up,

37
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:30,608
but we do not let
our anger get the best of us.

38
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:34,988
Service, compassion, mercy,
those are the words we live by.

Give me some insight
into the mind of a 20-year-old.

00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:27,515
he's gotta do more than learn.
He's gotta become.

159
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:31,811
Okay, relax, Yoda.
You're not going anywhere. He's got time.

160
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:34,355
Time is not the problem.

161
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:36,065
The kid is…

162
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:37,942
What?

163
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:39,777
He's way too emotional.

164
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,237
He's distracted.

165
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,075
He's not even close to being ready.

166
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:53,624
<i>Maybe he never will be.</i>

167
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:59,505
Aperitifs on the roof. How civilized!

168
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:01,882
Hey, Uncle Walt.

169
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:06,345
What are you doing up here?

170
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:07,428
Oh, you know,

171
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,932
thinking and drinking.

172
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,016
Huh.

173
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,938
I heard about what happened.

174
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:17,857
Yeah. Who hasn't?

175
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:21,569
You wanna talk?

176
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:26,489
What is it?

177
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:35,708
<i>He's not even close to being ready.</i>

178
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,294
<i>Maybe he never will be.</i>

179
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:41,005
<i>He's not even close to being ready.</i>

180
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:42,797
Brandon.

181
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:46,886
Um…

182
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:51,265
Let's go eat.

183
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:56,353
What was Dad like when he was younger?

184
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,190
Before he got his powers, I mean.

185
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:03,986
Shel, he was…

186
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:07,740
You know,
he didn't have a care in the world.

187
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:14,038
Nothing ever rattled the bastard.

188
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,383
- Good morning, boys.
- Hey, Shel.

189
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:27,947
- How you doing, Clyde?
- Hot as hell!

190
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,930
You got that right.
Roscoe, what's the good word?

191
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:32,681
- Wedding bells! That's the rumor.
- That's not a rumor.

192
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:35,267
I'm walking down that aisle, pal.
What about you two?

193
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:36,351
Hey, Shel.

194
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:38,896
She finally pinned you down, huh?

195
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:41,732
I couldn't be happier
to kiss the floor, Willie.

196
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:42,733
You do right by her.

197
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:45,194
You keep it zipped up tight,
you never have to fight.

198
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:46,654
- Hey, Pop!
- What?

199
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:47,937
Sorry about that, Mr. Sampson.

200
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:51,283
No! And what did I tell you
about calling me "Mr. Sampson"?

201
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:53,285
Come on, Fitz.
That ain't me. That's my old man.

202
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:54,787
Ah, never mind him.

203
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:58,540
- Congratulations, Shel.
- Hey, appreciate that. Thank you.

204
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:01,168
- Have you seen my dad?
- With your brother, I last saw.

205
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:04,380
- All right. Have a good day, boys.
- You too.

206
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:10,678
What are you talking about?
Fisher says it's a permanent plateau.

207
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:12,262
Good morning, boys.

208
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:13,889
Shel, get him to listen.

209
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:16,433
Dad, you listen to Walt.

210
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:19,079
- What are we talking about?
- Your brother wants to sink the deal.

211
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:19,937
What?

212
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:24,191
You asked me to kick the tires.
I did. The tread's wearing thin.

213
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:27,861
Every Joe Lunchbox with a spare nickel
is buying on margin

214
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:29,530
with as little as 10% down.

215
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:33,701
The market has been gaining 20% annually
since 1922. Fisher says...

216
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:36,453
I don't give a fat, flying shit
what Irving Fisher says!

217
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,330
- Hey! Language!
- Sorry.

218
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:41,709
- Fisher could be wrong.
- He went to Yale.

219
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:43,293
- Right?
- Yeah.

220
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:45,087
Your little guys are overextended.

221
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,298
Agriculture is in a slump.

222
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:51,468
The Federal Reserve
just hiked interest rates a full point.

223
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:53,262
Hoover knows what he's doing.

224
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:56,473
So, everyone knows what they're doing
except me.

225
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:58,357
Come on, Walter.
That's not what we're saying.

226
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:02,730
Walt, we get it.
You're the glass-half-empty guy.

227
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:07,443
Every company needs one of those
to keep feet nailed to the ground.

228
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:10,195
But sometimes you gotta have faith.

229
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:13,282
You've gotta step off that ledge
if you're ever gonna soar.

230
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:14,700
That's right, Pops.

231
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:17,578
Okay. Let's just…

232
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,915
Hold off for a few months.

233
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:24,543
Months?

234
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:27,421
The board is ready
to back the play now, Walt.

235
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:29,840
We're about to break ground
on three new mills.

236
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:32,509
Do you have any idea
how much a delay like that could run us?

237
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:34,136
- I got numbers on that.
- Oh, Jesus!

238
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,859
Yeah, of course he's got numbers on that.

239
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:39,308
Walt, it's not about the money.
It's not about the numbers.

240
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:42,478
It's about what we do,
and what we do is build,

241
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,289
- not just with steel, but with people.
- Dad.

242
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:45,981
Yes. And for some of these guys,

243
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:49,109
the more we expand, the more good jobs
that we can give good men.

244
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:51,070
A chance
to grab that American Dream, Walter.

245
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:52,196
- Come on.
- Shel…

246
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:56,075
Walt, it's not about the board,
or the Fed, or Irving Fisher.

247
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:59,620
It's about people, Walt.
It's about family.

248
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,589
Okay, come on. Everyone, sit down.

249
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:13,258
Mmm. That smells amazing.

250
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:15,594
I mean, can my man cook,
or can my man cook?

251
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:17,012
Looks great, Dad.

252
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,348
Come on. It's Sunday dinner
It's not the Last Supper.

253
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:20,766
Let's lower our expectations.

254
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:23,352
Tell your old man
it's okay to take a bow once in a while.

255
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:26,188
- I don't think he'll listen.
- I'll drink to that.

256
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:29,525
Well, at least we're all on the same page.
Walt, are you forgetting something?

257
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:31,777
I'm sorry. Would you like a glass?

258
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,130
You didn't have to bring anything.
We have plenty of wine.

259
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:37,324
It's just a little Pinot I picked up
in Côte de Beaune on my way over.

260
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:41,203
I'm not talking about the wine.
We say grace before we eat in this house.

261
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:43,348
- Technically, I'm drinking, so…
- Come on.

262
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:45,791
Join hands and close our mouths.

263
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:48,752
We waiting for Chloe?

264
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:53,757
I think we've all eaten enough
cold Sunday dinners to learn not to.

265
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:58,470
Lord, thank you for your generosity.

266
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:03,433
Thank you for the blessings
of the meal we eat today.

267
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,061
Oh!

268
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:08,312
Look who showed up.

269
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:12,860
- Uh…
- Hi.

270
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:14,611
- Sorry.
- Come in.

271
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:17,739
Sorry. My agent called
just right when I was leaving, and I…

272
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,743
- It's okay.
- Uncle Walt!

273
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,451
Hey, kiddo. Oh!

274
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:23,954
It's so good to see you. Are you okay?

275
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:25,998
Uh, not if you squeeze me like that.

276
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:28,292
Sorry. Sorry.

277
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:29,543
Honey, honey…

278
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:31,336
- Oh, is that Pinot?
- Yeah.

279
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,213
Honey, your dad was just saying grace.

280
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:36,675
Oh. Sorry. Sorry. You were saying grace.

281
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:39,011
All right, let's join hands.

282
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:41,096
Chloe, come on.

283
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,180
Hands.

284
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:48,395
Thank you for our health.
Bless those who are in need.

285
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:51,815
Please open our hearts to your love.

286
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:55,986
We ask your blessing
through Christ, your Son.

287
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:59,323
- Amen.
- Amen.

288
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:01,742
Here you go.

289
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:03,911
Mom, this looks so good.

290
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:06,747
Don't thank me. Thank your dad.
He's the one that made it all.

291
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,207
Go, Dad!

292
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,375
Uh…  Did Jesus help?

293
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:13,754
Only with the bread, honey.

294
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:16,215
Come on, Chloe.

295
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:17,883
That was a good one.

296
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:20,719
If you made fish,
you could've had a runner.

297
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:25,182
I saw your magazine cover, Chloe.

298
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:26,475
You looked beautiful.

299
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:28,143
Thanks, Uncle Walt.

300
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:31,188
Uh, photographer was a real asshole.

301
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:32,356
Language!

302
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:34,024
Sorry. Sorry.

303
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:36,443
He… he was a real anus.

304
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:39,780
Hey, was that the one
that you did for <i>InStyle?</i>

305
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:41,740
No, it was <i>Marie Claire.</i>

306
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,704
You saw it?

307
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:49,705
I did see it.

308
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:56,463
It was… it was a beautiful photo, honey.

309
00:20:58,215 --> 00:20:59,341
Beautiful.

310
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,887
I mean,
you could've probably worn a little more.

311
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:07,683
I could wear a lot less.

312
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:09,017
If you wanna be naked.

313
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:12,396
You wanna cover up your body
with a rubber suit and shiny boots,

314
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:13,605
that's your kink.

315
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:16,525
Your brother uses his gifts
to help the world be a better place,

316
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:19,069
not to grab attention or endorsements.

317
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:22,489
I don't need powers
to get attention or a job,

318
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:24,741
- so shove your shit back up your ass.
- Oh! Chloe!

319
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:26,618
Don't you ever talk like that in my house.

320
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:29,955
"My house, my rules, my Code."

321
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:32,916
I didn't ask to be your daughter,

322
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,419
and I sure as shit
didn't ask for your gifts.

323
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:37,754
Those gifts are not for you, Chloe.

324
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:41,550
Those gifts are meant for people
who are less fortunate than you.

325
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:46,013
Everyone's more fortunate than me
'cause they don't have you as their dad.

326
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:47,096
Chloe!

327
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:50,267
Apologize to your father.

328
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,894
- What? He started it!
- Apologize.

329
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:56,106
Now!

330
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:01,862
I'm sorry.

331
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,573
Thanks for dinner.

332
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:12,581
It's the last one I'm ever coming to.

333
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:22,966
She took the wine.

334
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,472
- Hey!
- Don't. Just don't.

335
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:30,075
You don't know what I'm gonna say yet.

336
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:32,184
You're not that complicated.

337
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:35,312
I used to like that about you.

338
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:38,357
Why do you talk to him like that?

339
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,318
Are you seriously sticking up for him?

340
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:43,278
Oh.

341
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:46,531
Of course you are.
You are his perfect little shadow.

342
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:47,741
Hey.

343
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:48,824
Hey!

344
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:54,164
Don't act like I forgot
what it was like to have him as a father.

345
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:57,876
- I didn't get treated any differently.
- Then why stay here?

346
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:01,713
Why subject yourself to this every day?

347
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:07,469
Dad can't keep this up forever.
Somebody has to be the next Utopian.

348
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:09,679
- Why?
- Because, Chloe,

349
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:13,058
the Utopian stands for something.
He's a symbol. He's...

350
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:14,142
He's a myth.

351
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:15,977
He's a myth.

352
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:21,775
Dad knows that he should have been
there for us when we were younger

353
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:24,820
but won't admit it,

354
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:28,824
because it's not the ideal.

355
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:34,913
Someone still has to stand for something.

356
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:44,047
No one can live up to the great Utopian,
Brandon…

357
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:48,051
Not even Dad.

358
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:50,803
You know what?

359
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:53,932
You're just jealous
that he picked me instead of you.

360
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:55,767
I am not jealous, Brandon.

361
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:01,148
I am sorry…

362
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:07,696
That you think you have
to carry 120 years of his bullshit

363
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:09,573
so Daddy will love you again.

364
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:14,786
You don't.

365
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:38,602
You know they invented
this thing called a dishwasher?

366
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:40,434
I like washing the dishes.

367
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:42,772
It occupies the hands,
lets the mind wander.

368
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:47,068
You know, drying is not as exciting.
Would you like to take over?

369
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:48,695
Sure.

370
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:52,240
I will be in not the kitchen
if you need me,

371
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,367
so, uh, let's not need me.

372
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:56,828
- Good night.
- Mwah.

373
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:02,250
She hasn't changed
since the day I met her.

374
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:04,836
Yeah, thank God some things stay the same.

375
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,173
Where did Brandon get to?

376
00:25:09,257 --> 00:25:10,467
He and Tectonic went out.

377
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:14,262
I guess hanging out with the old man
isn't as fun as it used to be.

378
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:16,806
That boy idolizes you.

379
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:18,767
He's stubborn and thick-headed.

380
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:21,561
Apple fell right next to you, didn't it?

381
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:23,688
Yeah, I guess so.

382
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:28,193
- He's a good kid, Shel.
- Yeah.

383
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,862
Kid has a lot of potential.

384
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:33,073
Anyone can see that.

385
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:35,867
The world's filled
with kids with potential

386
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:37,077
who didn't make it.

387
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:41,456
- They didn't have you.
- Yeah, well, tell that to Chloe.

388
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:47,712
Rest of these can soak.
Let's you and me go for a ride.

389
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:49,464
- Where?
- You're out of beer.

390
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:51,359
There's half a case in the fridge.

391
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:53,718
You're out of good beer.
Come on, dry your hands.

392
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:09,609
Do you mind?

393
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:12,778
Brandon?

394
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:16,533
It's not every day
Paragon's out on the town.

395
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:18,553
- Why don't you show 'em some love?
- Come on, man.

396
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:20,257
You know
we can't be into self-endorsement.

397
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:22,789
- Wow.
- Not the example we should be setting.

398
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:25,208
Didn't know
your dad would be joining us tonight.

399
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:26,459
Back up. Back up.

400
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:28,795
You know what? I think I might head home.

401
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:30,630
Some of us have training in the morning.

402
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:34,050
Whoa. Chill out, okay?
I haven't seen you in months.

403
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:38,013
Have a shot for me. Please. Hmm?

404
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:42,057
All right.

405
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:45,395
Look, I know how much
you wanna be the next Utopian

406
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:47,689
and the sacrifices you're willing to make,

407
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:50,400
but you and I both know
what kind of a ball-breaker your dad is.

408
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:54,529
Nothing is ever good enough for the man.
Everything falls short of his standards.

409
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:55,613
You think I don't know?

410
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:58,575
I swear, your pop and the original members
of the Union resent us

411
00:26:58,658 --> 00:27:00,761
'cause they had to go through
the worst shit imaginable

412
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:01,620
to get their powers.

413
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:03,830
I've heard this story a thousand times.

414
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:08,668
I mean, you're right.
Not our fault we were born into this.

415
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:12,631
Yeah. Then why accept the punishment?

416
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:16,635
- I'm not giving up, Barry.
- I'm not suggesting that.

417
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,260
I'm just saying

418
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:23,308
look at everything you've missed out on
trying to impress your dad.

419
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:24,643
And what's it gotten you?

420
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:27,687
In the meantime,
you're not living your life.

421
00:27:28,271 --> 00:27:30,106
You're definitely not enjoying the moment.

422
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:32,692
Barry! Hi! Love you!

423
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:37,781
I don't know. I think
my sister does that enough for both of us.

424
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:40,200
Look how that's working out for her.

425
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:43,370
I'm only saying all this because I care.

426
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:46,414
I want you to be the next Utopian.

427
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:48,667
But you can't put your life on hold.

428
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:50,959
Cheers.

429
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:08,770
Thank you.

430
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:12,065
All right, Jane.

431
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:14,693
- Tell Walt and your father I said hello.
- If they're lucky.

432
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,320
Bye.

433
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:25,995
Hey, hey. Could you not whistle so loud?

434
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:28,915
You damn near
split my skull half a block back.

435
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:33,086
George! Oh man!
Where the hell have you been?

436
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:34,629
- Rinsdale twins.
- Ah.

437
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:36,433
Flew back east,
took the yacht up the coast.

438
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:37,382
How far?

439
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:38,883
Mmm. Nova Scotia,

440
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:41,487
- before she caught fire and sank.
- Caught fire? What happened?

441
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:43,805
Mary thought I was paying too much
attention to Margaret.

442
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:45,724
Or was it the other way around?
I don't know.

443
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:47,207
Okay, what is going?

444
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:50,562
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's going on?
- The stock market went tits up!

445
00:28:50,645 --> 00:28:52,856
You got money in the bank,
get it out, quick!

446
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,372
- It's down another two and a quarter!
- Shit!

447
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:11,332
Get Greenwald on the line
at National First.

448
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:14,002
- He's not picking up.
- Well, get somebody on that damn blower!

449
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:15,245
- Walt!
- Where have you been?

450
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:16,671
- We just heard.
- How bad is it?

451
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:19,591
How bad does it look?
Wall Street just melted down

452
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:21,434
and burned a hole
to the center of the earth.

453
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:24,387
- Down another three quarters!
- I told you it wasn't time to expand.

454
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:28,266
And here we are, Shel,
jammed so far up the ass you can taste it.

455
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:32,269
Where's Dad?

456
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:35,022
Dad.

457
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:36,940
Dad.

458
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:40,445
What are you doing up here?

459
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:42,822
Just look at this city.

460
00:29:44,365 --> 00:29:46,493
Sampson Steel runs through all of it.

461
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:48,369
Okay, Dad, come on. We gotta go.

462
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:51,289
We built something here.
We made something.

463
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:54,375
The Prendergast building.
You remember him?

464
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:57,629
Butch Prendergast.

465
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:01,090
He had a dream. He came to us.

466
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:04,511
So we gave him the steel
to put his first plant up.

467
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:09,891
"I want to make boxes," he said.
"Everything needs a box. Every…"

468
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:15,855
All your life, you try to build something.

469
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:20,652
Try to build it bigger, better, faster.

470
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:23,780
Build a legacy.

471
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:26,991
Then, one day, it turns out

472
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:31,079
you've been building your own box,
and you're the one inside of it.

473
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:35,959
Everything ends up in a box, Shel.

474
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:39,337
Okay.

475
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:42,590
Come on. We gotta go.
They need you down there.

476
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:43,674
Yeah.

477
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:45,175
Come on.

478
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:48,596
- You tell them I'll be right down.
- Okay.

479
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:54,727
No! Don't, Dad! Don't!

480
00:30:56,896 --> 00:31:00,358
Dad! Dad!

481
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:18,918
When was the last time
we all sat around this table,

482
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:21,170
the team from the beginning?

483
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:24,591
Uh…

484
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:27,051
Seventy… Sixty-something.

485
00:31:28,344 --> 00:31:29,721
Right before George…

486
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:35,059
Before Skyfox turned on us.

487
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:41,399
You ever thought about why he did it?

488
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:43,234
I know why he did it.

489
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:44,777
He's insane.

490
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:45,861
Nah.

491
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:47,697
He was a good man.

492
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:52,160
He's a terrorist, Sheldon.
He took the vice president hostage.

493
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:54,245
He thought he was doing the right thing.

494
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:56,122
Yeah, so did Charles Manson.

495
00:31:58,082 --> 00:31:59,834
The Union of Justice.

496
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:04,255
All these trophies,
all the battles we've fought…

497
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:06,299
Hell of a thing.

498
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:13,848
From thinking
you had a screw loose back in '29 to this.

499
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:23,232
Ninety years.

500
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:27,654
Ninety years
of fighting wizards and robots,

501
00:32:27,737 --> 00:32:29,322
and what do we have to show for it?

502
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:31,616
We've made a difference, Shel.

503
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,368
Well…

504
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:36,871
Quicksand.

505
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:38,455
What?

506
00:32:39,248 --> 00:32:41,459
The country's never been
more divided, Walt.

507
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,920
Congress is at a standstill.

508
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:46,339
No one's willing
to meet in the middle anymore.

509
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:50,093
The gap between rich and poor
just keeps getting wider.

510
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:54,931
Kids learning active-shooter drills
before they even learn their ABCs.

511
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:57,475
Nazis smashing up the streets, Walt.

512
00:32:57,558 --> 00:32:59,198
Not what they call themselves these days.

513
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:02,397
Oh, they're Nazis. I don't care
what the hell they call themselves.

514
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:07,443
It's all sinking into the ground

515
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:12,115
after all these years,
after everything we've sacrificed.

516
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:15,618
Doesn't have to be that way.

517
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:22,250
- If we played a more active role…
- Okay.

518
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:24,627
…In helping
the administration shape policy, then...

519
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:27,088
- Like George? Is that it?
- George!

520
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:29,215
It is against the Code.

521
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:32,427
We don't kill. We don't lead. We inspire.

522
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:35,888
The people of this country need
to make their own choices.

523
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:37,765
Yeah, how's that working out?

524
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:42,353
To this day,

525
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:46,357
I still regret not doing more
in World War II.

526
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,028
You talk about Nazis.

527
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:54,741
We had the chance
to end the war a lot sooner,

528
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:58,828
save countless lives
in Dachau and Auschwitz,

529
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:03,416
take any discussion of the atomic bomb
completely off the table.

530
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,001
And then what?

531
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:07,837
Huh?

532
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:11,632
Get involved with Korea?
Vietnam? The Middle East?

533
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:14,886
Start dictating social
and economic policy?

534
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:18,473
And where does that end, huh?

535
00:34:19,348 --> 00:34:22,560
And more importantly,
who is gonna stop us?

536
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:25,688
It'd be the end of free will.

537
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:30,610
Well, some would say free will

538
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:34,197
is what's bringing the world to its knees.

539
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:38,659
The days of making a difference
by stopping supervillains

540
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:39,911
are over, Sheldon,

541
00:34:40,703 --> 00:34:44,749
now just memorabilia, nostalgia.

542
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:48,461
The real evil today
is less black and white.

543
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:52,924
Not bootleggers or gangsters.

544
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:57,553
It's corrupt corporations, politicians,

545
00:34:57,637 --> 00:35:01,682
the quiet guy at work no one talked to
who just bought an automatic rifle.

546
00:35:02,391 --> 00:35:06,521
So you're saying the Code
doesn't apply anymore. Is that it?

547
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:09,565
No, I'm not saying that.

548
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:15,196
I'm just saying isn't all this
starting to feel a little repetitive?

549
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:16,864
And do you really think

550
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:20,451
just putting away bank robbers

551
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:23,121
is gonna make the world
a safer, better place?

552
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Sheldon.

553
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:34,382
We've got a situation in Nebraska.
It's Blackstar. He escaped the Supermax.

554
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,602
What's going on?

555
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:48,228
Hey, Ruby.

556
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:50,815
The Union's fighting Blackstar
over the ridge.

557
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:53,860
Blackstar? How did he get out of the 'Max?

558
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:56,195
I guess he broke out. What do I know?

559
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:58,990
Why aren't you over there, helping?

560
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:02,285
You kidding me? I got flaming fists.

561
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:06,873
Blackstar's got an antimatter heart.

562
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:09,625
I'm hanging back.
Let the big guns soften him up,

563
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:11,836
and I'll get there at the end
for the photo op.

564
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:17,550
Okay. That's a pretty good plan.

565
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:18,926
Hell yeah, it is.

566
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:23,556
- So who's all over there?
- Uh, Utopian, Lady Liberty, Brainwave.

567
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:24,974
- Ugh.
- I know, right?

568
00:36:25,057 --> 00:36:28,227
- Who else?
- Flare, Phase Out, Ectoplex, Paragon…

569
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:29,520
- Brandon's there?
- Yeah.

570
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:32,231
I heard you two were a thing.

571
00:36:33,065 --> 00:36:34,692
We split up a couple weeks back.

572
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:36,985
Huh.

573
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:40,614
So, uh…

574
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:43,618
What are you doing later?

575
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:46,329
Shit! Briggs, look out!

576
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:15,775
Lady Liberty? Mrs. Sampson!

577
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:28,663
Mrs. Sampson, you gotta get up.
You gotta get up.

578
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:43,052
- I'm going after Dad.
- No! Stick to the mission.

579
00:37:43,135 --> 00:37:44,135
Go!

580
00:38:18,504 --> 00:38:19,922
Barry, hit him!

581
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:55,041
Barry!

582
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:25,654
Walt! Get in his head and shut him down!

583
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:26,822
I'm trying!

584
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,086
Dad.

585
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:42,963
Dad!

586
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:01,607
There. That's better.

587
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:07,822
I've just separated your mind
from your physical body,

588
00:40:09,031 --> 00:40:11,200
trapping you in a psychic painting.

589
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:13,619
It's one of my favorites, actually.

590
00:40:13,702 --> 00:40:15,955
Say hi to Blackstar, darling.

591
00:40:16,038 --> 00:40:17,164
Hi, Blackstar.

592
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:21,502
Relax. This shouldn't take long.

593
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:24,380
I thought it might be nice
to go somewhere quiet

594
00:40:24,463 --> 00:40:29,218
while my brother and the rest of the team
kick the living shit out of you.

595
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:40,187
Would you like some cake
while we're waiting?

596
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:44,984
Oh, not in here, my friend.

597
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:47,820
In here,

598
00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:50,322
I am God…

599
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:53,075
…and you

600
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:54,660
are fu...

601
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:35,117
He's going nuclear!

602
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:46,587
<i>He's not even close to being ready.</i>

603
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,006
<i>Maybe he never will be.</i>

604
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:15,407
What is wrong with you?

605
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:17,660
We don't kill, ever!

606
00:42:17,743 --> 00:42:19,245
He was gonna detonate, Dad.

607
00:42:19,995 --> 00:42:21,997
He was gonna take you out
and half the state.

608
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:25,834
Then you disable his systems.
You… you send him into space.

609
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:28,128
There's a million things
you could have done.

610
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:30,798
You took the easy way out.

611
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:33,133
- Did that look easy to you?
- Sheldon!

612
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:36,470
Go. Wait for me at the Union.

613
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:46,438
Walt, contact the Supermax.
I wanna know how Blackstar got out.

614
00:42:46,522 --> 00:42:47,648
On it.

615
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:50,525
You okay?

616
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:52,986
No.

617
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:56,365
Our son took a life.

618
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:01,787
After everything we've taught him,
he broke the Code.

619
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:02,870
Shel.

620
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:06,375
We have a problem.

621
00:43:26,478 --> 00:43:27,855
Huh.

622
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:35,029
What the hell is this?

623
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,490
It appears to be you.

623
00:43:39,305 --> 00:44:39,403
