1
00:00:06,441 --> 00:00:08,158
Previously on
"Resident Alien"...

2
00:00:08,182 --> 00:00:09,724
Aah!

3
00:00:09,748 --> 00:00:11,161
So what happened to the
real Harry Vanderspeigle?

4
00:00:11,185 --> 00:00:12,858
I don't know.

5
00:00:12,882 --> 00:00:14,599
Dr. Vanderspeigle, a
new doctor has arrived.

6
00:00:14,623 --> 00:00:17,341
- Please call me Dr. Ethan.
- I'm glad you know about me.

7
00:00:17,365 --> 00:00:19,430
Nobody wants to hide
who they really are.

8
00:00:19,454 --> 00:00:22,172
You should stop feeling
guilty about giving away Jay.

9
00:00:22,196 --> 00:00:25,305
She is a survivor.

10
00:00:25,329 --> 00:00:27,351
He will die.

11
00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:29,701
My leg... chop it off.

12
00:00:29,725 --> 00:00:30,919
Aah!

13
00:00:30,943 --> 00:00:32,747
If Asta wasn't there,
I would be dead.

14
00:00:32,771 --> 00:00:35,228
They took your
spaceship, didn't they?

15
00:00:35,252 --> 00:00:36,621
That means they're after you.

16
00:00:36,645 --> 00:00:40,277
It's probably
M.I.B... men in black.

17
00:00:40,301 --> 00:00:41,713
I invited a friend
over with her husband.

18
00:00:41,737 --> 00:00:43,671
This is Sarah and
Richard Houston.

19
00:00:43,695 --> 00:00:45,195
You can babysit Max
whenever you want.

20
00:00:45,219 --> 00:00:47,023
I would love that.

21
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:48,327
You shouldn't have taken that.

22
00:00:49,484 --> 00:00:50,983
Now the kid's gonna
know we were in his room.

23
00:00:51,007 --> 00:00:52,550
Good.

24
00:00:52,574 --> 00:00:54,247
Then when he goes to warn
it, we'll be right on its tail.

25
00:00:54,271 --> 00:00:56,641
Asta! Are you in there?

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,074
-== [ www.OpenSubtitles.com ] ==-

27
00:01:07,893 --> 00:01:10,176
Everyone has to die.

28
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,873
It is the normal cycle of life

29
00:01:11,897 --> 00:01:14,876
for beings across
the entire universe.

30
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,574
Some may live
longer than others,

31
00:01:16,598 --> 00:01:18,880
but every organism
comes into being

32
00:01:18,904 --> 00:01:21,187
and then ceases being.

33
00:01:27,391 --> 00:01:29,456
The animals know this.

34
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,241
They live in harmony
with the Earth,

35
00:01:31,265 --> 00:01:33,591
as it was meant to be.

36
00:01:33,615 --> 00:01:37,682
Everyone I kill with my
device is going to die anyway.

37
00:01:37,706 --> 00:01:40,946
At least I'm killing
them for a good reason.

38
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:44,645
It's different for humans.

39
00:01:44,669 --> 00:01:47,213
Humans kill because
they know they're small,

40
00:01:47,237 --> 00:01:49,520
insignificant, weak.

41
00:01:49,544 --> 00:01:52,784
And killing makes
them feel strong

42
00:01:52,808 --> 00:01:55,178
even if it's just for a moment.

43
00:02:41,552 --> 00:02:44,444
And when humans are smart,

44
00:02:44,468 --> 00:02:47,795
they may even get
away with murder.

45
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:07,337
Of course, no being really
gets away with anything.

46
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:16,955
The universe knows
what you have done,

47
00:03:16,979 --> 00:03:19,958
even if nobody else does.

48
00:03:33,865 --> 00:03:36,061
And the universe
will restore balance

49
00:03:36,085 --> 00:03:37,845
one way or another.

50
00:03:41,046 --> 00:03:43,068
Humans have a word for this.

51
00:03:44,528 --> 00:03:46,376
They call it "karma."

52
00:04:02,938 --> 00:04:05,046
I thought you said
Asta's car was here.

53
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:06,526
Calling me a liar?

54
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:08,224
Well, if the shoe fits, D'arce.

55
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,703
Please don't fight.

56
00:04:09,727 --> 00:04:11,314
Look, D'arce, we're all
just freaking out a little bit.

57
00:04:11,338 --> 00:04:12,576
Like, this is bad.

58
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,012
You damn near gave
me a heart attack

59
00:04:14,036 --> 00:04:15,579
banging on my door like
that at the crack of dawn.

60
00:04:15,603 --> 00:04:17,929
I'm so sorry that
finding the dead body

61
00:04:17,953 --> 00:04:19,713
of the man I love
locked in a freezer

62
00:04:19,737 --> 00:04:21,759
is so inconvenient for you!

63
00:04:21,783 --> 00:04:24,501
All right? It's a
human life, asshole.

64
00:04:24,525 --> 00:04:26,198
Okay? Harry is dead.

65
00:04:29,356 --> 00:04:31,551
What is going on out here?

66
00:04:31,575 --> 00:04:33,597
I'm standing here wondering
why I ain't home in bed.

67
00:04:33,621 --> 00:04:35,120
Thank God you're alive.

68
00:04:35,144 --> 00:04:37,340
This isno, it's impossible.

69
00:04:37,364 --> 00:04:40,256
She is worse than your dog.

70
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,302
Yeah, well, I didn't have
the heart to wake Cletus up.

71
00:04:43,326 --> 00:04:45,304
He was in REM
sleep chasing goats.

72
00:04:45,328 --> 00:04:47,088
I'll get her.

73
00:04:47,112 --> 00:04:48,481
Sorry about this, Dr. V,

74
00:04:48,505 --> 00:04:50,962
but, D'arcy broke into
your cellar last night

75
00:04:50,986 --> 00:04:53,007
and she thinks she saw
a dead you in the freezer.

76
00:04:53,031 --> 00:04:54,487
I told her it was probably

77
00:04:54,511 --> 00:04:55,793
just some meat in there
that looked like you,

78
00:04:55,817 --> 00:04:56,968
like a frozen pig or something.

79
00:04:56,992 --> 00:04:58,796
I am more handsome than a pig.

80
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,493
- Me too.
- Yeah, man, I'm probably

81
00:05:00,517 --> 00:05:02,147
somewhere between
a pig and a dolphin.

82
00:05:02,171 --> 00:05:04,367
You know, that dolphin,
that's a fine-ass animal.

83
00:05:09,352 --> 00:05:10,808
It's nothing but meat.

84
00:05:10,832 --> 00:05:13,898
- You moved the body.
- Sure enough.

85
00:05:13,922 --> 00:05:15,029
And here it is.

86
00:05:15,053 --> 00:05:16,422
No, I meant the
dead guy, dipshit.

87
00:05:16,446 --> 00:05:17,728
Obviously it's not him,

88
00:05:17,752 --> 00:05:19,207
but I saw a dead
body down there.

89
00:05:20,581 --> 00:05:22,428
Why was Asta's car outside?

90
00:05:22,452 --> 00:05:24,430
We went to a medical
conference together.

91
00:05:24,454 --> 00:05:26,040
You smell like alcohol.

92
00:05:26,064 --> 00:05:27,825
- Okay, come on, D'arce.
- You have to go now.

93
00:05:27,849 --> 00:05:30,001
- I'll buy you breakfast.
- No.

94
00:05:30,025 --> 00:05:31,829
No!

95
00:05:31,853 --> 00:05:34,310
I know what I saw. Stop
trying to gaslight me.

96
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,528
I know I'm not crazy.

97
00:05:35,552 --> 00:05:38,183
The deputy said

98
00:05:38,207 --> 00:05:39,184
it's time to go.

99
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:40,228
What? No.

100
00:05:40,252 --> 00:05:41,534
- No!
- Let's...

101
00:05:41,558 --> 00:05:43,493
Get your... hands off me!

102
00:05:43,517 --> 00:05:44,624
Dear.

103
00:05:44,648 --> 00:05:46,060
Help me, Deputy!

104
00:05:46,084 --> 00:05:49,063
- She on me like a spider!
- Dish it out...

105
00:05:49,087 --> 00:05:52,632
It's unfortunate I have to
kill everyone and leave here.

106
00:05:52,656 --> 00:05:55,331
The warmth of
spring is just arriving.

107
00:06:00,403 --> 00:06:02,163
Let go of my damn hair!

108
00:06:02,187 --> 00:06:04,427
- Let go of his hair.
- Get your damn...

109
00:06:04,451 --> 00:06:06,690
D'arcy, let go of the chair.

110
00:06:06,714 --> 00:06:07,865
- Yes.
- Take that!

111
00:06:07,889 --> 00:06:10,389
- You spit...
- It is quite nice here.

112
00:06:10,413 --> 00:06:11,521
Handcuffs, that's
what they're for.

113
00:06:11,545 --> 00:06:12,913
They're for cuffing hands!

114
00:06:12,937 --> 00:06:15,220
Come on. Come on.

115
00:06:15,244 --> 00:06:16,439
- I give you credit.
- Okay.

116
00:06:16,463 --> 00:06:17,614
You fight like a
pack of pit bulls.

117
00:06:17,638 --> 00:06:18,919
Come on, hit me!

118
00:06:18,943 --> 00:06:21,444
You know you want
to hit me, Sheriff.

119
00:06:21,468 --> 00:06:23,184
- Do it!
- Please stop struggling!

120
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:25,230
It's gonna be okay,
I'll drive your car back.

121
00:06:25,254 --> 00:06:26,449
Get in the car!

122
00:06:26,473 --> 00:06:28,146
I'm sorry about this, Doctor.

123
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:31,889
Yes, I'm very upset
at this intrusion.

124
00:06:33,088 --> 00:06:34,370
"I'm gonna read
you your rights."

125
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:35,719
What do I say?

126
00:06:35,743 --> 00:06:37,547
Tell me what I say!

127
00:06:37,571 --> 00:06:38,722
That's the problem.

128
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:43,770
Okay, all right, all
right, all right, all right.

129
00:07:03,814 --> 00:07:05,836
- Pull it up.
- I have to see this.

130
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,209
Aye.

131
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,589
There, she's stealing it.

132
00:07:19,613 --> 00:07:20,938
I knew it.

133
00:07:20,962 --> 00:07:25,159
She's a woman in a
purple skirt, man in black.

134
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:27,205
We have to warn Harry.

135
00:07:46,204 --> 00:07:48,661
Told you he'd
lead us to the alien.

136
00:08:01,089 --> 00:08:02,414
You want to tell
me what happened?

137
00:08:02,438 --> 00:08:04,677
- I'm worried about you.
- You're overreacting.

138
00:08:04,701 --> 00:08:06,679
It's not like you've never
bailed me out of jail before.

139
00:08:06,703 --> 00:08:08,551
"Overreacting"? Cool.

140
00:08:08,575 --> 00:08:10,248
I woke up this morning
to a hundred texts

141
00:08:10,272 --> 00:08:11,989
and a voicemail
from you screaming,

142
00:08:12,013 --> 00:08:13,294
"He's dead! He's dead!"

143
00:08:13,318 --> 00:08:15,383
All right, look, I
know what happened.

144
00:08:15,407 --> 00:08:18,125
All right? You and
Harry murdered a guy.

145
00:08:18,149 --> 00:08:19,431
It happens, but
I'm here for you.

146
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:20,824
We're gonna take
my car to Canada.

147
00:08:20,848 --> 00:08:22,478
From there, I've got an
old ski buddy in Juneau.

148
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:25,306
There's a safe deposit box,
1,000 bucks to keep us going.

149
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:28,440
Three passports. So...

150
00:08:28,464 --> 00:08:30,921
That's... a lot to process.

151
00:08:30,945 --> 00:08:33,750
But, no, I did not kill anyone.

152
00:08:33,774 --> 00:08:35,229
Are you sure?

153
00:08:35,253 --> 00:08:38,232
I'd remember.

154
00:08:38,256 --> 00:08:40,887
Right. Right.

155
00:08:40,911 --> 00:08:43,150
Cool, so the Sheriff was
right. I'm seeing things.

156
00:08:43,174 --> 00:08:46,284
- New low.
- D'arcy, what did you do?

157
00:08:46,308 --> 00:08:48,634
I sort of broke into
Harry's house last night,

158
00:08:48,658 --> 00:08:51,115
and I saw a
freezer full of meat,

159
00:08:51,139 --> 00:08:53,596
and I thought it
was a dead body.

160
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,946
D'arce, how much
did you have to drink?

161
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:57,556
Barely anything to drink.

162
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:01,604
I had a couple edibles and
a pill I found in my couch.

163
00:09:01,628 --> 00:09:03,606
- Come on!
- Look

164
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:06,826
you're obviously keeping
some big secret from me.

165
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:08,045
You're my best friend!

166
00:09:08,069 --> 00:09:11,135
I would not keep
secrets from you.

167
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:12,963
- You're lying.
- No, I'm not.

168
00:09:12,987 --> 00:09:14,747
- Yes, you are.
- No.

169
00:09:14,771 --> 00:09:16,227
You have a tell, remember?

170
00:09:16,251 --> 00:09:18,011
When you're lying,
you get overly huggy

171
00:09:18,035 --> 00:09:19,839
and touchy.

172
00:09:19,863 --> 00:09:21,517
That's not true.

173
00:09:22,953 --> 00:09:24,496
D'arce, come on.

174
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,019
Thanks for bailing
me out. I got to go.

175
00:09:26,043 --> 00:09:27,978
D'arcy.

176
00:09:31,832 --> 00:09:34,288
God.

177
00:09:42,016 --> 00:09:44,298
Slow down. You're too close.

178
00:09:44,322 --> 00:09:46,344
Jesus Christ, it's like
driving with my grandmother.

179
00:09:46,368 --> 00:09:47,998
"Why don't you go
out back, Memaw,

180
00:09:48,022 --> 00:09:50,000
and knit me a sweater?"

181
00:09:58,032 --> 00:10:00,532
Great, you distracted me,
now we're losing the little shit.

182
00:10:00,556 --> 00:10:04,014
- My God.
- Areare you all right?

183
00:10:04,038 --> 00:10:07,017
Watch your language, please.

184
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:10,063
And you owe me
$100 for the bike.

185
00:10:10,087 --> 00:10:11,891
Um.

186
00:10:11,915 --> 00:10:13,153
Looks fine to me.

187
00:10:13,177 --> 00:10:15,721
I'd be happy to
wait for the police.

188
00:10:15,745 --> 00:10:16,940
Pay the girl.

189
00:10:16,964 --> 00:10:18,985
You're the one who
made me run her over.

190
00:10:19,009 --> 00:10:20,378
Let's go.

191
00:10:20,402 --> 00:10:21,858
Now we've lost him.

192
00:10:23,971 --> 00:10:26,471
Pleasure.

193
00:10:26,495 --> 00:10:29,692
- Taking so long.
- It's $100.

194
00:10:32,675 --> 00:10:35,045
My device is at full power.

195
00:10:35,069 --> 00:10:37,743
With one press of the
button, the timer will begin,

196
00:10:37,767 --> 00:10:40,093
and roughly 90
Earth minutes later,

197
00:10:40,117 --> 00:10:43,270
8 billion humans
will cease to exist.

198
00:10:43,294 --> 00:10:45,055
This is the moment
I fulfill the mission

199
00:10:45,079 --> 00:10:47,840
that will change the course
of the universe forever.

200
00:10:47,864 --> 00:10:50,016
Are you dreaming of pizza?

201
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,539
Mama Sap's Pizza is now open

202
00:10:51,563 --> 00:10:54,020
in the heart of
downtown Patience!

203
00:11:00,703 --> 00:11:04,074
I can't kill everyone on
Earth with an empty stomach.

204
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:37,237
Is Jay working here?

205
00:11:37,261 --> 00:11:39,762
I gave her a part-time job.

206
00:11:39,786 --> 00:11:42,460
Dad, I don't think
that's a good idea.

207
00:11:42,484 --> 00:11:45,879
You're friends with an
alien, and Jay's a bad idea?

208
00:11:47,271 --> 00:11:49,685
- She's coming over.
- Get out of here!

209
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:54,472
Hey.

210
00:11:54,496 --> 00:11:55,865
Hey.

211
00:11:55,889 --> 00:11:58,302
Um, I see you have a new job.

212
00:11:58,326 --> 00:11:59,825
Yeah. First day.

213
00:11:59,849 --> 00:12:01,827
Cool.

214
00:12:01,851 --> 00:12:04,830
Look, D'arcy told me what
happened on the mountain.

215
00:12:04,854 --> 00:12:06,876
Just wanted to make
sure you didn't lose

216
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:09,182
any fingers or toes or anything.

217
00:12:09,206 --> 00:12:11,141
- No.
- Um...

218
00:12:11,165 --> 00:12:13,883
Got 'em!

219
00:12:13,907 --> 00:12:15,580
Look, I was gonna tell you

220
00:12:15,604 --> 00:12:18,148
that if you ever
want to talk about

221
00:12:18,172 --> 00:12:21,673
everything, anything, I'm here.

222
00:12:21,697 --> 00:12:24,807
You want me to talk
to you about you?

223
00:12:27,268 --> 00:12:28,724
Well

224
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,290
- I was thinking we could...
- No.

225
00:12:30,314 --> 00:12:31,639
Sure. Yeah.

226
00:12:31,663 --> 00:12:33,250
You know, I should
get back to work.

227
00:12:33,274 --> 00:12:36,122
Of course. It was
nice to see you.

228
00:12:39,367 --> 00:12:40,910
- Hello.
- Hello.

229
00:12:40,934 --> 00:12:43,260
Hello, Miss Twelvetrees.

230
00:12:45,329 --> 00:12:47,351
Help yourself.

231
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:49,594
I know that you know.

232
00:12:53,511 --> 00:12:56,142
I know that you know.

233
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:58,362
Does she know?

234
00:12:58,386 --> 00:13:00,277
"She" has a name.

235
00:13:00,301 --> 00:13:01,844
And she knows.

236
00:13:01,868 --> 00:13:04,890
She knows a lot.

237
00:13:07,351 --> 00:13:09,286
We have a situation.

238
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:11,201
The government is after him.

239
00:13:11,225 --> 00:13:13,246
They know that I know who he is.

240
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:15,205
What? How?

241
00:13:15,229 --> 00:13:16,859
Because they're the government.

242
00:13:16,883 --> 00:13:18,948
Don't be so naive.

243
00:13:18,972 --> 00:13:20,210
Excuse me?

244
00:13:20,234 --> 00:13:21,733
I'm sorry.

245
00:13:21,757 --> 00:13:23,691
Sometimes I speak to
adults like they're my peers

246
00:13:23,715 --> 00:13:26,085
because I'm mature for my age.

247
00:13:26,109 --> 00:13:27,913
I'm working on it.

248
00:13:27,937 --> 00:13:29,393
I hid a camera in my room,

249
00:13:29,417 --> 00:13:31,308
- and I saw them search my house.
- What?

250
00:13:31,332 --> 00:13:32,744
And they went
back to their base,

251
00:13:32,768 --> 00:13:34,746
and now they're driving
around searching for him.

252
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:38,010
How do you know
where their base is?

253
00:13:38,034 --> 00:13:40,360
We have our ways.

254
00:13:47,348 --> 00:13:50,327
Where is my phone?

255
00:14:01,144 --> 00:14:02,513
I learned from the squirrels

256
00:14:02,537 --> 00:14:04,167
that when you've
filled your stomach,

257
00:14:04,191 --> 00:14:07,387
you should take as much
food as you can to eat later.

258
00:14:07,411 --> 00:14:09,912
With this pizza stack,
I can kill everyone

259
00:14:09,936 --> 00:14:12,915
and still have
pizza to eat for days.

260
00:14:12,939 --> 00:14:14,699
And now, with a
belly that's bursting

261
00:14:14,723 --> 00:14:16,875
like a stuffed garbage bag,

262
00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:20,574
there's nothing stopping me
from completing my mission.

263
00:14:26,474 --> 00:14:28,408
I should test it first.

264
00:14:31,261 --> 00:14:32,804
Okay, you two.

265
00:14:32,828 --> 00:14:35,676
I'll be upstairs on the
treadmill if you need anything.

266
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,765
Sahar, thank you again for
helping Max with his homework.

267
00:14:37,789 --> 00:14:39,115
I don't mind.

268
00:14:39,139 --> 00:14:41,595
I want to be a teacher
when I'm old, like you.

269
00:14:41,619 --> 00:14:43,206
Wow.

270
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:45,686
I'm not old. I'm young, okay?

271
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:47,993
My life is not passing me by.

272
00:14:48,017 --> 00:14:51,562
I'm just just living it. But
that’s that’s wonderful.

273
00:14:51,586 --> 00:14:54,478
It's just wonderful.

274
00:15:03,163 --> 00:15:05,881
This... makes no sense.

275
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,057
It says the phone is here.

276
00:15:08,081 --> 00:15:09,623
You're tracking the wrong phone.

277
00:15:09,647 --> 00:15:11,538
Put it on your mom's.

278
00:15:11,562 --> 00:15:13,671
It is on my mom's.

279
00:15:13,695 --> 00:15:15,194
It can't be.

280
00:15:15,218 --> 00:15:18,632
I put your mom's phone
right under the RV.

281
00:15:29,493 --> 00:15:31,341
Lock the front door.
I'll get the back.

282
00:15:38,241 --> 00:15:40,480
Don't be afraid.

283
00:15:40,504 --> 00:15:42,482
We just need your help.

284
00:15:42,506 --> 00:15:44,944
I'm not giving your
100 bucks back.

285
00:16:01,221 --> 00:16:03,155
My device uses the
Earth's own energy

286
00:16:03,179 --> 00:16:05,331
to send a pulse
throughout the world

287
00:16:05,355 --> 00:16:07,464
that will kill every human.

288
00:16:07,488 --> 00:16:10,162
I can also direct it
to a singular point

289
00:16:10,186 --> 00:16:13,035
and get rid of this body.

290
00:16:17,411 --> 00:16:20,346
Will it hurt?

291
00:16:21,893 --> 00:16:24,524
You again?

292
00:16:24,548 --> 00:16:27,397
You know you're just stalling.

293
00:16:27,421 --> 00:16:29,529
You're afraid to kill everyone.

294
00:16:29,553 --> 00:16:31,879
No, I'm not.

295
00:16:31,903 --> 00:16:34,186
My people do not feel fear.

296
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:37,102
Yes, but you're not your
people anymore, are you?

297
00:16:37,126 --> 00:16:40,758
You've been infected
with humanity.

298
00:16:40,782 --> 00:16:43,500
I don't need to listen to this!

299
00:16:43,524 --> 00:16:47,373
I was supposed to die
of old age with Isabelle.

300
00:16:47,397 --> 00:16:49,985
I even bought a plot
in Upstate New York

301
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:53,423
under the most
beautiful maple tree.

302
00:16:53,447 --> 00:16:56,078
We were supposed to be
next to each other forever.

303
00:16:58,495 --> 00:17:00,082
Do you miss her?

304
00:17:00,106 --> 00:17:03,737
I miss a lot of things

305
00:17:03,761 --> 00:17:07,263
the five senses

306
00:17:07,287 --> 00:17:10,831
driving around
with nowhere to go

307
00:17:10,855 --> 00:17:13,704
tacos.

308
00:17:13,728 --> 00:17:16,402
- But I loved Isabelle.
- How do you know?

309
00:17:16,426 --> 00:17:19,188
How do I know I loved my wife?

310
00:17:19,212 --> 00:17:21,668
What did it feel like?

311
00:17:23,477 --> 00:17:26,021
It feels like

312
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,893
life.

313
00:17:28,917 --> 00:17:31,069
Like everything
you've ever felt.

314
00:17:31,093 --> 00:17:35,073
The joy and the
fury held in your heart

315
00:17:35,097 --> 00:17:38,294
and wrapped in

316
00:17:38,318 --> 00:17:40,426
hope

317
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:44,300
hope that everything
will be okay.

318
00:17:44,324 --> 00:17:47,346
Love makes you feel
connected to everything.

319
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:49,827
Make you feel light-headed,
you feel like you're floating.

320
00:17:49,851 --> 00:17:51,698
I love Isabelle, too.

321
00:17:51,722 --> 00:17:54,614
- You're an asshole.
- You don't even know her!

322
00:17:54,638 --> 00:17:57,052
I do.

323
00:17:57,076 --> 00:18:00,055
When she left

324
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,969
my heart felt
like it was falling.

325
00:18:01,993 --> 00:18:03,449
That's rejection.

326
00:18:03,473 --> 00:18:04,929
That's not love.

327
00:18:04,953 --> 00:18:08,411
Then why do I feel
the other things?

328
00:18:08,435 --> 00:18:11,066
I feel hope.

329
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,633
I feel connected to everyone

330
00:18:13,657 --> 00:18:15,113
to everything.

331
00:18:15,137 --> 00:18:18,290
I used to feel those things.

332
00:18:18,314 --> 00:18:20,118
You took it all from me.

333
00:18:23,885 --> 00:18:25,602
I'm sorry.

334
00:18:25,626 --> 00:18:28,213
You didn't just take
Isabelle away from me.

335
00:18:28,237 --> 00:18:31,521
When you killed me, you
took me away from Isabelle.

336
00:18:31,545 --> 00:18:33,958
She needs me.

337
00:18:33,982 --> 00:18:35,046
Stop.

338
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:37,483
Stop doing that with your eyes.

339
00:18:37,507 --> 00:18:41,226
When you killed
me, you killed her.

340
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:42,836
- No.
- Yes!

341
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,273
She cries every day.

342
00:18:44,297 --> 00:18:46,188
No. No, she doesn't.

343
00:18:46,212 --> 00:18:47,493
You broke her heart!

344
00:18:47,517 --> 00:18:48,518
Stop!

345
00:18:58,224 --> 00:19:00,680
Harry, where are you?

346
00:19:00,704 --> 00:19:02,160
Please call me
when you get this.

347
00:19:02,184 --> 00:19:03,335
I need to talk to you.

348
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:04,858
Hey, Asta. How you doing?

349
00:19:04,882 --> 00:19:06,556
- Hey.
- Um

350
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:09,428
I need to leave
early. Is that okay?

351
00:19:09,452 --> 00:19:11,213
That's fine. It's slow.

352
00:19:11,237 --> 00:19:12,953
I'll hold down the fort.

353
00:19:12,977 --> 00:19:15,719
Okay. Thank you.

354
00:19:18,505 --> 00:19:21,005
Hey, Asta, can you help me out?

355
00:19:21,029 --> 00:19:22,963
I need that dead foot.

356
00:19:22,987 --> 00:19:24,356
- Really?
- Yeah.

357
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:27,427
I found a boot. I need
to see if it's a match.

358
00:19:31,257 --> 00:19:33,887
There might be
another murder in town.

359
00:19:38,264 --> 00:19:39,676
So you're telling me eventually

360
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:43,070
that thing will
look like that one?

361
00:19:43,094 --> 00:19:44,985
Where did you get the boot?

362
00:19:45,009 --> 00:19:48,293
On the shore next to
Dr. Vanderspeigle's house.

363
00:19:49,971 --> 00:19:53,603
So what happened to the
real Harry Vanderspeigle?

364
00:19:54,976 --> 00:19:56,736
I don't know.

365
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,390
I sort of broke into
Harry's house last night,

366
00:19:58,414 --> 00:19:59,913
and I saw a
freezer full of meat,

367
00:19:59,937 --> 00:20:01,567
and I thought it
was a dead body.

368
00:20:01,591 --> 00:20:03,308
Another murder is horrible,

369
00:20:03,332 --> 00:20:05,484
but we're gonna
get who did this.

370
00:20:05,508 --> 00:20:07,051
Promise.

371
00:20:07,075 --> 00:20:09,271
Okay?

372
00:20:33,928 --> 00:20:35,427
She has her earphones in.

373
00:20:35,451 --> 00:20:36,950
She can't hear anything.

374
00:20:36,974 --> 00:20:39,301
I could scream louder
than her workout songs.

375
00:20:39,325 --> 00:20:41,259
I can get her down
here in two seconds!

376
00:20:41,283 --> 00:20:42,782
Well, you're not gonna
like what happens to her

377
00:20:42,806 --> 00:20:44,088
when you do that.

378
00:20:44,112 --> 00:20:45,437
You need to tell us
where this alien is,

379
00:20:45,461 --> 00:20:48,614
- you little shits.
- Why should we?

380
00:20:48,638 --> 00:20:51,443
Because it's
here to kill us all.

381
00:20:58,039 --> 00:21:00,452
If you think I am
afraid to kill everybody,

382
00:21:00,476 --> 00:21:02,759
you are dumb!

383
00:21:02,783 --> 00:21:06,003
I could press this
button at any time.

384
00:21:07,657 --> 00:21:08,939
If you agree with me

385
00:21:08,963 --> 00:21:10,984
and I am right
and you are wrong,

386
00:21:11,008 --> 00:21:15,598
then just sit there dead
and don't say anything.

387
00:21:15,622 --> 00:21:18,209
Okay, then.

388
00:21:18,233 --> 00:21:19,689
We agree.

389
00:21:19,713 --> 00:21:23,282
Goodbye, only human in the room.

390
00:21:37,992 --> 00:21:40,797
That's impossible.

391
00:21:40,821 --> 00:21:43,626
The energy doesn't
affect my people.

392
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:44,931
Was he right?

393
00:21:44,955 --> 00:21:48,457
Am I no longer my people?

394
00:21:48,481 --> 00:21:51,677
But that means if
I set off my device,

395
00:21:51,701 --> 00:21:53,853
it will kill me, too.

396
00:21:59,274 --> 00:22:01,383
Hey.

397
00:22:01,407 --> 00:22:04,516
What are you doing out here?

398
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:05,996
Nothing.

399
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:08,825
Just making up nicknames
for everybody who walks by.

400
00:22:08,849 --> 00:22:12,350
Want to have a
seat, Mr. Short Pants?

401
00:22:12,374 --> 00:22:16,485
Cool, guess I'll be throwing
these out when I get home.

402
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:23,230
This is the same
bench that we sat on

403
00:22:23,254 --> 00:22:26,843
that day we skipped Mrs.
Henderson's science class.

404
00:22:26,867 --> 00:22:29,672
God, you're right.

405
00:22:29,696 --> 00:22:32,220
That's a long time ago.

406
00:22:34,962 --> 00:22:36,809
Are you okay?

407
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:39,246
I

408
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:42,511
Remember being
so happy that day.

409
00:22:42,535 --> 00:22:45,862
That was right before
I left for Stratton.

410
00:22:45,886 --> 00:22:48,517
I remember feeling like

411
00:22:48,541 --> 00:22:50,519
my life was just starting.

412
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:57,482
Yeah, you've always
been happy like that.

413
00:22:57,506 --> 00:22:59,223
It's what I love about you.

414
00:22:59,247 --> 00:23:01,399
You know, it's what
everyone loves.

415
00:23:03,294 --> 00:23:04,881
I'm not happy.

416
00:23:06,254 --> 00:23:09,233
- You're not?
- Are you?

417
00:23:09,257 --> 00:23:10,887
Well, no.

418
00:23:10,911 --> 00:23:13,498
But I was never really
happy to begin with.

419
00:23:13,522 --> 00:23:15,457
So...

420
00:23:15,481 --> 00:23:20,505
Yeah, well, I had a
chance at being happy, but

421
00:23:20,529 --> 00:23:22,899
it just went away, you know?

422
00:23:22,923 --> 00:23:26,381
I hurt my leg, and that was it.

423
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,687
Hey...

424
00:23:28,711 --> 00:23:30,559
You can be happy.

425
00:23:32,541 --> 00:23:34,867
Look, I'm gonna play the
nickname game with you,

426
00:23:34,891 --> 00:23:38,915
and your nickname is Miss...

427
00:23:38,939 --> 00:23:40,786
You're Amazing.

428
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:42,266
All right.

429
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:44,747
Well, you're...
bad at that game.

430
00:23:44,771 --> 00:23:47,445
But it's true.

431
00:23:47,469 --> 00:23:50,927
I mean, you've accomplished
so much in your life.

432
00:23:50,951 --> 00:23:52,494
Shut up.

433
00:23:52,518 --> 00:23:55,018
I-I'm not amazing.

434
00:23:55,042 --> 00:23:58,195
I-I feel like I've done
nothing with my life.

435
00:23:58,219 --> 00:23:59,762
I just

436
00:23:59,786 --> 00:24:02,504
wanted to

437
00:24:02,528 --> 00:24:04,201
I just wanted to matter

438
00:24:04,225 --> 00:24:08,640
make a difference
to somebody, I...

439
00:24:08,664 --> 00:24:10,337
Maybe it's all just bullshit.

440
00:24:10,361 --> 00:24:12,470
No, you matter.

441
00:24:12,494 --> 00:24:15,366
You're smart and funny.

442
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:18,955
I-I wish I was like you.

443
00:24:18,979 --> 00:24:21,958
I'm terrified of pretty
much everything.

444
00:24:21,982 --> 00:24:25,788
But sometimes I look at you, and

445
00:24:25,812 --> 00:24:28,312
you're so fearless.

446
00:24:28,336 --> 00:24:32,534
It makes me feel, I
don't know, less scared.

447
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:35,841
You know, you make me happy.

448
00:24:35,865 --> 00:24:38,061
Um.

449
00:24:38,085 --> 00:24:39,410
- What are you doing?
- Sorry.

450
00:24:39,434 --> 00:24:40,977
- I'm married, D'arcy.
- Sorry about that.

451
00:24:41,001 --> 00:24:42,631
- Yeah.
- My God.

452
00:24:42,655 --> 00:24:43,893
I'm so sorry,

453
00:24:43,917 --> 00:24:45,416
- I thought that...
- No, it's okay.

454
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,810
- I got to go.
- Right, right.

455
00:24:47,834 --> 00:24:49,899
Got togot to go.

456
00:24:49,923 --> 00:24:51,446
Shit!

457
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:59,125
Please, Max, you
have to trust me.

458
00:24:59,149 --> 00:25:01,650
He is going to kill everyone.

459
00:25:01,674 --> 00:25:02,825
Tell us who he is.

460
00:25:02,849 --> 00:25:04,740
He's not going to kill everyone.

461
00:25:04,764 --> 00:25:07,873
His ship is a Quimbaya amulet.

462
00:25:07,897 --> 00:25:09,919
Max, he's going
to kill everyone.

463
00:25:09,943 --> 00:25:12,574
He won't. He'll listen to me!

464
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,187
Why are you in my house?

465
00:25:17,211 --> 00:25:19,561
Sarah, what is going on?

466
00:25:21,171 --> 00:25:23,019
"Hey, honey."

467
00:25:23,043 --> 00:25:25,108
"Good evening, sweetheart."

468
00:25:25,132 --> 00:25:27,066
"Yeah, day was good.
What's for dinner?

469
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:29,025
Divorce? Great."

470
00:25:34,794 --> 00:25:37,076
Lock the door? That's weird.

471
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,556
Okay, take whatever you want.

472
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,123
- Please.
- Don't make me use this gun.

473
00:25:40,147 --> 00:25:41,747
- My God, my God.
- Don't hurt the kids.

474
00:25:43,193 --> 00:25:45,520
- Mike, I need your help.
- There's people in my house.

475
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,391
My family is in there.
They have a gun.

476
00:25:47,415 --> 00:25:49,132
What? Okay, all right, look.

477
00:25:49,156 --> 00:25:50,481
Do not move. Don't go inside.

478
00:25:50,505 --> 00:25:52,048
We'll be there in
five minutes, all right?

479
00:25:52,072 --> 00:25:53,484
No, no, no, we don't
have five minutes.

480
00:25:53,508 --> 00:25:56,705
Look, do not go inside!
We're on the way.

481
00:25:56,729 --> 00:25:58,010
Deputy!

482
00:25:58,034 --> 00:25:59,098
Shit!

483
00:26:00,733 --> 00:26:02,449
Shit!

484
00:26:02,473 --> 00:26:04,060
My God. My God.

485
00:26:04,084 --> 00:26:05,191
Help.

486
00:26:05,215 --> 00:26:06,628
Let me out of here!

487
00:26:06,652 --> 00:26:09,718
If you touch my
kid, I will kill you!

488
00:26:09,742 --> 00:26:11,894
Max, who is that?

489
00:26:11,918 --> 00:26:14,897
Why is he wearing a white coat?

490
00:26:14,921 --> 00:26:16,594
Okay, I'll tell you.

491
00:26:16,618 --> 00:26:17,769
I swear to God!

492
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,905
Get away from my kid!

493
00:26:22,929 --> 00:26:24,471
Okay, he told us who it is.

494
00:26:24,495 --> 00:26:26,125
We got what we need. Let's go.

495
00:26:26,149 --> 00:26:28,954
- Hold on, Max!
- Whoa, we're not doing that.

496
00:26:28,978 --> 00:26:30,652
We're doing whatever
I say we're doing.

497
00:26:37,421 --> 00:26:38,597
Get down.

498
00:27:28,864 --> 00:27:32,670
You guys are like Daredevil
and the Black Widow.

499
00:27:37,917 --> 00:27:39,982
Thank you for saving my life.

500
00:27:40,006 --> 00:27:41,723
Time to go.

501
00:27:47,753 --> 00:27:49,861
These things don't usually
have a happy ending.

502
00:27:49,885 --> 00:27:51,341
It could've been a lot worse.

503
00:27:51,365 --> 00:27:53,517
Yeah, I don't recommend
citizens taking the law

504
00:27:53,541 --> 00:27:55,519
into their own
hands, but that was...

505
00:27:55,543 --> 00:27:58,653
That was some real hero
shit the two of you did in there.

506
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,872
Well, we're a pretty good team.

507
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:03,701
Yes, we are.

508
00:28:06,206 --> 00:28:10,752
You both have blood,
like, all over your shoes.

509
00:28:10,776 --> 00:28:13,319
I'm never washing them.

510
00:28:13,343 --> 00:28:15,147
Me neither.

511
00:28:22,048 --> 00:28:23,286
No.

512
00:28:28,402 --> 00:28:29,684
That's a lot of tongue.

513
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,555
You trying to get all
the way in the back?

514
00:28:31,579 --> 00:28:32,687
- Y'all nasty.
- Really?

515
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:34,166
Y'all got a room right upstairs.

516
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:36,647
Boy.

517
00:28:44,287 --> 00:28:46,178
How's that article coming?

518
00:28:46,202 --> 00:28:47,397
Need another quote?

519
00:28:49,466 --> 00:28:51,096
Asta's my mother.

520
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,359
Yeah. Sheriff Mike's my father.

521
00:28:57,953 --> 00:29:00,018
You...

522
00:29:00,042 --> 00:29:03,108
Holy shit.

523
00:29:03,132 --> 00:29:04,743
You're the baby.

524
00:29:06,222 --> 00:29:07,722
I'm not surprised
she didn't tell you.

525
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:10,376
She's been keeping it a secret.

526
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,639
Yeah.

527
00:29:12,663 --> 00:29:14,598
Yeah, she has.

528
00:29:14,622 --> 00:29:16,339
I don't know what to do.

529
00:29:16,363 --> 00:29:17,819
She's my mother,

530
00:29:17,843 --> 00:29:19,908
and I don't even know
how to act in front of her.

531
00:29:19,932 --> 00:29:22,475
Not to mention my father.

532
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:25,348
Right.

533
00:29:25,372 --> 00:29:26,436
Jimmy.

534
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:27,872
It's so messed up.

535
00:29:27,896 --> 00:29:30,266
What am I supposed to
say to someone like that?

536
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:32,311
I mean, I'm gonna see him.

537
00:29:32,335 --> 00:29:34,836
And I can't talk to Asta.
I can't talk to my parents.

538
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:36,620
I probably shouldn't even
be talking to you right now,

539
00:29:36,644 --> 00:29:39,754
but I feel like I
am losing my mind

540
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:41,843
and I need someone
in this town to talk to...

541
00:29:41,867 --> 00:29:44,497
Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey!

542
00:29:44,521 --> 00:29:46,543
You can totally talk to me.

543
00:29:46,567 --> 00:29:48,371
I can't live here
like this, okay?

544
00:29:48,395 --> 00:29:50,634
I can't do...

545
00:29:50,658 --> 00:29:53,637
You are not running
away from this.

546
00:29:53,661 --> 00:29:57,249
And you are not alone.

547
00:29:57,273 --> 00:29:58,816
I can help you.

548
00:30:01,582 --> 00:30:03,018
Hey.

549
00:30:04,541 --> 00:30:06,911
Can you get free onion rings?

550
00:30:06,935 --> 00:30:08,695
It's part of the plan.

551
00:30:14,203 --> 00:30:15,702
Yeah, okay.

552
00:30:20,993 --> 00:30:23,798
You killed Harry Vanderspeigle.

553
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,887
No, I didn't.

554
00:30:25,911 --> 00:30:28,846
Do not lie to me.

555
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:31,196
Okay, I killed him,
but he started it.

556
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:34,243
Do you have any
idea what you did?

557
00:30:34,267 --> 00:30:36,941
You cannot just murder someone.
That is not how it works here.

558
00:30:36,965 --> 00:30:39,204
Humans kill people all the time.

559
00:30:39,228 --> 00:30:41,772
Someone killed Sam Hodges, so...

560
00:30:41,796 --> 00:30:44,731
Yeah, and you saw
what that did to me,

561
00:30:44,755 --> 00:30:47,778
to all of us, and you
did the same thing.

562
00:30:47,802 --> 00:30:48,910
No.

563
00:30:48,934 --> 00:30:50,825
Goodbye. This is done.

564
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:53,436
- We are done.
- No, don't say that.

565
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:54,698
- Wait, wait.
- What?

566
00:30:54,722 --> 00:30:56,569
What?

567
00:30:56,593 --> 00:31:00,008
It'll be okay.
It's like the song.

568
00:31:00,032 --> 00:31:03,838
"Ooh, child, things
are going to get easier."

569
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:05,970
"Ooh, child"... Stop.

570
00:31:05,994 --> 00:31:07,972
- Don't touch me!
- I'm sorry.

571
00:31:07,996 --> 00:31:10,279
You just can't leave me.

572
00:31:10,303 --> 00:31:13,151
Don't tell me what I
can and cannot do.

573
00:31:13,175 --> 00:31:14,674
Wow, you are
really getting a hang

574
00:31:14,698 --> 00:31:17,416
of this human-male bullshit.

575
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,375
Don't go. It hurts!

576
00:31:22,097 --> 00:31:23,770
It's...

577
00:31:23,794 --> 00:31:26,773
It's you.

578
00:31:26,797 --> 00:31:28,123
You're the reason
that I feel it...

579
00:31:28,147 --> 00:31:30,865
The joy and the
fury all wrapped up.

580
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:33,998
You want fury?

581
00:31:34,022 --> 00:31:36,348
Go back to your planet, Harry.

582
00:31:36,372 --> 00:31:38,133
Whoever you are,

583
00:31:38,157 --> 00:31:40,744
whatever you are, I never
want to see you again.

584
00:31:40,768 --> 00:31:41,919
But we are friends.

585
00:31:41,943 --> 00:31:44,443
I am not friends with people

586
00:31:44,467 --> 00:31:46,097
I mean... not people.

587
00:31:46,121 --> 00:31:47,533
I don't know what you are.

588
00:31:47,557 --> 00:31:50,275
But I know what you're
not. You are not my friend.

589
00:31:56,566 --> 00:31:58,196
I thought you were my friend.

590
00:32:18,458 --> 00:32:20,218
I do not like this.

591
00:32:22,853 --> 00:32:26,311
I don't like this place anymore.

592
00:32:57,410 --> 00:32:59,214
So, I

593
00:32:59,238 --> 00:33:01,390
I guess you're my father.

594
00:33:01,414 --> 00:33:04,654
Yeah.

595
00:33:04,678 --> 00:33:08,310
If you ever touch Asta
again, I'll... kill you.

596
00:33:10,336 --> 00:33:12,444
Feel better?

597
00:33:12,468 --> 00:33:14,098
D'arcy, what are you...

598
00:33:14,122 --> 00:33:16,318
D'arcy, don't!

599
00:33:16,342 --> 00:33:18,929
Son of a bi...

600
00:33:18,953 --> 00:33:20,191
D'arcy!

601
00:33:20,215 --> 00:33:23,325
No, no, no, no, no!

602
00:33:29,398 --> 00:33:32,160
Look out! Out of the way!

603
00:33:37,232 --> 00:33:40,124
Yeah. Yeah, I feel better.

604
00:33:40,148 --> 00:33:42,648
Yeah, me too.

605
00:33:42,672 --> 00:33:44,824
We we should go now.

606
00:34:02,518 --> 00:34:04,018
Miss Twelvetrees?

607
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:06,107
Hey, it's Max Hawthorne.

608
00:34:06,131 --> 00:34:07,369
I need your help.

609
00:34:07,393 --> 00:34:08,935
Harry's here to kill everyone,

610
00:34:08,959 --> 00:34:11,242
and I think I know
where he's going.

611
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:26,649
Excuse me.

612
00:34:26,673 --> 00:34:28,825
Are you the town doctor?

613
00:34:28,849 --> 00:34:30,218
Yes, I am.

614
00:34:30,242 --> 00:34:32,002
That is a nasty cut...

615
00:34:42,515 --> 00:34:44,536
Town doctor.

616
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,842
That kid was right.

617
00:34:45,866 --> 00:34:47,583
He is the prettiest
alien I've ever seen.

618
00:34:48,782 --> 00:34:50,107
Yeah. Just be
careful, all right?

619
00:34:50,131 --> 00:34:51,282
We don't know what
this monster's capable of.

620
00:34:51,306 --> 00:34:52,544
Yeah.

621
00:35:10,543 --> 00:35:13,304
- Move, move. Let's go.
- Whoa.

622
00:35:15,504 --> 00:35:17,439
What what the hell is this?

623
00:35:19,465 --> 00:35:21,399
Come on.

624
00:35:21,423 --> 00:35:23,619
- I knew you were real.
- Okay.

625
00:35:23,643 --> 00:35:25,664
I-I got you your alien.

626
00:35:25,688 --> 00:35:28,798
So now I'm officially
done with her.

627
00:35:28,822 --> 00:35:31,192
- Aw.
- I'm sorry.

628
00:35:31,216 --> 00:35:33,019
This woman is

629
00:35:33,043 --> 00:35:34,804
an unhinged psychotic.

630
00:35:34,828 --> 00:35:37,111
I agree completely.

631
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:38,547
Close it up!

632
00:35:40,529 --> 00:35:42,072
Wait, are you’re you
guys men in black?

633
00:35:42,096 --> 00:35:43,856
- Would you stop it.
- They're not called that.

634
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,380
You've watched too many movies.

635
00:35:45,404 --> 00:35:47,164
And if I wanted them involved,

636
00:35:47,188 --> 00:35:50,211
I would've told my superiors.

637
00:35:50,235 --> 00:35:53,388
And then we wouldn't
have an alien, would we?

638
00:35:53,412 --> 00:35:54,824
Who's we?

639
00:35:54,848 --> 00:35:57,740
This is bigger than
anything you could imagine.

640
00:35:57,764 --> 00:36:01,396
Too bad you won't be here
to see how it all plays out.

641
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:03,659
Get rid of him.

642
00:36:03,683 --> 00:36:05,878
I told you.

643
00:36:05,902 --> 00:36:08,707
- I have different orders.
- Okay, um...

644
00:36:14,694 --> 00:36:16,411
Kill ya later.

645
00:36:30,144 --> 00:36:32,601
See, I don't get it.

646
00:36:32,625 --> 00:36:34,472
I mean, first Sam,
then this roving couple

647
00:36:34,496 --> 00:36:36,953
going around terrorizing people.

648
00:36:36,977 --> 00:36:39,260
Don't get me wrong,
I like the mayhem.

649
00:36:39,284 --> 00:36:41,784
I like it a lot.

650
00:36:41,808 --> 00:36:43,829
I might like it a little too
much, if that's possible.

651
00:36:43,853 --> 00:36:44,874
It is.

652
00:36:44,898 --> 00:36:48,007
It's quite
frightening, actually.

653
00:36:48,031 --> 00:36:51,881
Don't forget the foot
with the matching boot.

654
00:36:51,905 --> 00:36:53,709
But

655
00:36:53,733 --> 00:36:56,494
can it all really be
just a coincidence?

656
00:36:56,518 --> 00:36:57,713
I don't believe in coincidence.

657
00:36:57,737 --> 00:36:59,976
Me neither.

658
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,631
So both the boot and the foot

659
00:37:02,655 --> 00:37:04,415
were found in the same area

660
00:37:04,439 --> 00:37:06,156
right by
Dr. Vanderspeigle's place.

661
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:08,463
Yeah, you mean the boot,
the foot, and the doorknob.

662
00:37:08,487 --> 00:37:11,205
That thing definitely didn't
come from no houseboat,

663
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:12,858
that's for sure.

664
00:37:12,882 --> 00:37:15,426
Looks like we might
have a new prime suspect.

665
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:16,906
Let's go visit Dr. Vanderspeigle

666
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:20,170
tomorrow morning, see if
he's got anything to add.

667
00:37:22,327 --> 00:37:24,305
What is that?

668
00:37:27,114 --> 00:37:31,790
My ...d.

669
00:37:31,814 --> 00:37:33,488
Is this a Nespresso?

670
00:37:33,512 --> 00:37:34,706
It's nothing, man.

671
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:35,838
I just picked that
up for the office.

672
00:37:35,862 --> 00:37:37,405
- It was on sale.
- Yes, yes!

673
00:37:37,429 --> 00:37:39,407
My God, my God!

674
00:37:39,431 --> 00:37:40,843
You got me a coffee pod machine!

675
00:37:40,867 --> 00:37:41,931
What are you doing?

676
00:37:41,955 --> 00:37:43,019
I got that for the whole office.

677
00:37:43,043 --> 00:37:44,803
- What are you doing?
- Nope.

678
00:37:44,827 --> 00:37:46,805
You got it for me,

679
00:37:46,829 --> 00:37:50,026
and you agree with
my doorknob instincts.

680
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:52,028
You got decent doorknob
instincts, all right?

681
00:37:52,052 --> 00:37:53,421
But this whole thing
is for everybody.

682
00:37:53,445 --> 00:37:54,552
- It ain't just for you.
- Nope.

683
00:37:54,576 --> 00:37:55,510
- What are you doing?
- Nope.

684
00:37:55,534 --> 00:37:57,207
You got it for me.

685
00:38:17,904 --> 00:38:19,882
You in the vehicle!

686
00:38:19,906 --> 00:38:22,038
Let me see your hands!

687
00:38:38,403 --> 00:38:40,250
I have no choice now,

688
00:38:40,274 --> 00:38:43,209
since my device will destroy me.

689
00:38:43,233 --> 00:38:45,560
I will fly away from
here and drop the device

690
00:38:45,584 --> 00:38:49,564
onto this beautiful planet
to finish the job I started.

691
00:39:19,618 --> 00:39:21,117
Whoa.

692
00:39:32,805 --> 00:39:34,348
Go, go, go!

693
00:39:40,813 --> 00:39:43,661
Double up, double up!

694
00:39:43,685 --> 00:39:44,836
Harry!

695
00:39:49,778 --> 00:39:51,582
There's more!

696
00:39:51,606 --> 00:39:53,410
Freeze!

697
00:39:53,434 --> 00:39:54,890
Hold it right there.

698
00:40:00,485 --> 00:40:02,008
No.

699
00:40:03,444 --> 00:40:05,272
I forgot the pizzas.

700
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:12,516
Maybe I can go
back and get them.

701
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:13,865
I could take the ship

702
00:40:13,889 --> 00:40:17,782
and pick them up
on my way to space.

703
00:40:17,806 --> 00:40:21,070
I can't because of
this stupid mission.

704
00:40:23,551 --> 00:40:25,858
I am so hungry.

705
00:40:27,076 --> 00:40:29,620
They look like black ants.

706
00:40:36,695 --> 00:40:38,934
Where is your queen?

707
00:40:45,791 --> 00:40:47,246
Come on.

708
00:40:55,583 --> 00:40:58,519
Get down.

709
00:40:58,543 --> 00:40:59,868
Harry!

710
00:41:33,665 --> 00:41:36,078
Run, Max! Hide!

711
00:41:43,892 --> 00:41:45,870
Harry

712
00:41:45,894 --> 00:41:48,003
I know why you're here.

713
00:41:48,027 --> 00:41:49,831
Don't do it. Please don't do it.

714
00:41:49,855 --> 00:41:51,136
I must.

715
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:54,531
- It's why I came here.
- I don't care.

716
00:41:54,555 --> 00:41:56,185
You're not the same.

717
00:41:56,209 --> 00:41:58,753
You've changed
since you came here,

718
00:41:58,777 --> 00:42:00,276
since you killed that man.

719
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:02,931
I've seen it. I just saw it now.

720
00:42:02,955 --> 00:42:05,629
You could've left, but
you stayed to help us.

721
00:42:05,653 --> 00:42:08,066
- You've changed.
- No.

722
00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:11,330
My mission is to kill everyone.

723
00:42:13,226 --> 00:42:15,247
If you kill everyone,

724
00:42:15,271 --> 00:42:16,771
you kill me.

725
00:42:21,974 --> 00:42:25,562
You are right, I
have changed, but...

726
00:42:25,586 --> 00:42:27,782
There's my friend.

727
00:42:27,806 --> 00:42:30,611
We are friends?

728
00:42:30,635 --> 00:42:32,656
Yes.

729
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:35,050
We are friends.

730
00:42:37,163 --> 00:42:41,056
So, that means you will
come with me to my planet

731
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:44,668
and we will kill everyone
on Earth together?

732
00:42:44,692 --> 00:42:46,844
What? No.

733
00:42:46,868 --> 00:42:49,891
I-I'ml'm staying here.

734
00:42:54,833 --> 00:42:58,377
Then I won't kill everyone.

735
00:42:59,968 --> 00:43:01,772
Okay, good.

736
00:43:04,277 --> 00:43:07,343
I will miss you, friend.

737
00:43:07,367 --> 00:43:08,910
I'll miss you, too, friend.

738
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:13,262
I should dispose of my device.

739
00:43:13,286 --> 00:43:16,004
It will kill everyone on Earth

740
00:43:16,028 --> 00:43:19,398
when it detonates in 80 seconds.

741
00:43:19,422 --> 00:43:20,486
My God.

742
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:22,663
Yes. Go.

743
00:43:22,687 --> 00:43:24,297
Go!

744
00:43:27,866 --> 00:43:30,496
Real quick

745
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:32,803
I left some pizzas

746
00:43:32,827 --> 00:43:35,893
in my freezer.

747
00:43:35,917 --> 00:43:38,461
You can have them
if you want them.

748
00:43:38,485 --> 00:43:39,897
Thank you.

749
00:43:39,921 --> 00:43:42,683
Go!

750
00:44:13,607 --> 00:44:16,760
Everyone has to die eventually.

751
00:44:16,784 --> 00:44:21,417
What matters are the choices
you make while you're alive.

752
00:44:21,441 --> 00:44:24,420
Killing may make humans
feel strong in the moment,

753
00:44:24,444 --> 00:44:26,683
but what I've
begun to realize is,

754
00:44:26,707 --> 00:44:30,165
true strength comes
from choosing not to kill.

755
00:44:30,189 --> 00:44:31,993
Maybe being truly human

756
00:44:32,017 --> 00:44:34,778
is about choosing
to love instead.

757
00:44:38,327 --> 00:44:40,218
But with that love
comes the pain

758
00:44:40,242 --> 00:44:42,090
that I feel inside me.

759
00:44:42,114 --> 00:44:44,222
I need to go home.

760
00:44:44,246 --> 00:44:46,094
Hopefully the further
I get from them,

761
00:44:46,118 --> 00:44:48,444
the less I will care.

762
00:44:48,468 --> 00:44:51,012
Finally, I will be
at peace again.

763
00:44:53,821 --> 00:44:55,930
Hi.

764
00:44:55,954 --> 00:44:58,933
You're taking me home, right?

765
00:44:58,957 --> 00:45:01,762
This is some bullshit!

765
00:45:02,305 --> 00:46:02,613
