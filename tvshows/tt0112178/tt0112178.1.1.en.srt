2
00:00:28,161 --> 00:00:29,150
Damage report!

3
00:00:29,229 --> 00:00:30,662
Shields at 60 percent.

4
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:32,960
Our fuel line has ruptured.
Attempting to compensate.

5
00:00:35,101 --> 00:00:38,036
Damn it! We're barely
maintaining impulse.

6
00:00:38,104 --> 00:00:39,503
l can't get any more out of it.

7
00:00:39,572 --> 00:00:40,937
Be creative.

8
00:00:41,007 --> 00:00:42,565
How am l supposed to be creative

9
00:00:42,642 --> 00:00:44,473
with a 39-year-old
rebuilt engine?

10
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:47,207
Maquis ship

11
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,010
this is Gul Evek
of the Cardassian Fourth Order.

12
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:52,517
Cut your engines and prepare
to surrender or we will de...

13
00:00:56,456 --> 00:00:59,254
lnitiating evasive pattern
omega. Mark.

14
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:03,921
Shields at 50 percent.

15
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:05,055
l need more power

16
00:01:05,131 --> 00:01:06,723
if we're going to make
it to the Badlands.

17
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,926
Take the weapons off-line.

18
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:09,969
We'll transfer all power
to the engines.

19
00:01:10,036 --> 00:01:11,060
Considering the circumstances,

20
00:01:11,137 --> 00:01:13,105
l'd question that proposal
at this time.

21
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:14,105
What does it matter?!

22
00:01:14,174 --> 00:01:17,234
We're not making a dent
in their shields anyway.

23
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,335
You wanted creative.

24
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:21,346
Tuvok, shut down
all the phaser banks.

25
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:23,814
lf you can give me another
30 seconds at full impulse,

26
00:01:23,883 --> 00:01:25,612
l'll get us into the Badlands.

27
00:01:25,685 --> 00:01:27,277
Phasers off-line.

28
00:01:27,353 --> 00:01:29,150
Throw the last photons at them

29
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:31,918
and then give me the power
from the torpedo systems.

30
00:01:31,991 --> 00:01:34,516
Acknowledged.
Firing photons.

31
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:42,998
Are you reading
any plasma storms ahead?

32
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:46,334
One.
Coordinates 17 1 mark 43.

33
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:48,262
That's where l'm going.

34
00:01:48,341 --> 00:01:51,242
Plasma storm density
increasing by 14 percent.

35
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:52,938
Twenty...

36
00:01:53,012 --> 00:01:54,445
Twenty-five...

37
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:55,538
Hold on!

38
00:02:03,089 --> 00:02:05,148
Cardassian ship
is not reducing power.

39
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:06,157
They're following us in.

40
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:08,660
Gul Evek must feel daring today.

41
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:16,231
They've taken a hit
on their port blade.

42
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:17,929
They're sending out
a distress signal

43
00:02:18,037 --> 00:02:19,698
on all Cardassian frequencies.

44
00:02:19,772 --> 00:02:20,739
Can you plot a course

45
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,274
through these plasma fields,
Mr. Tuvok?

46
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:25,243
Storm's activity is typically
widespread in this vicinity.

47
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:27,370
l can plot a course,
but l'm afraid it will require

48
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:28,436
an indirect route.

49
00:02:28,515 --> 00:02:30,210
We can use the time
to make some repairs.

50
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:32,842
What was that?

51
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:33,977
Curious.

52
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:37,420
We just passed through some kind
of coherent tetryon beam.

53
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,354
Source?

54
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:39,391
Unknown.

55
00:02:40,393 --> 00:02:41,417
Now there appears to be

56
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:42,961
a massive displacement wave
moving toward us.

57
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:44,462
Another storm?

58
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:46,158
lt's not a plasma phenomenon.

59
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:47,290
At current speeds

60
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:49,597
it will intercept us
in less than 30 seconds.

61
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:52,035
Anything left in those
impulse generators, B'Elanna?

62
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:53,105
We'll find out.

63
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,368
Still exceeding our speed.

64
00:02:55,441 --> 00:02:57,033
Maximum power.

65
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,771
Wave is continuing
to accelerate.

66
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,177
lt will intercept us
in eight seconds.

67
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,142
Five.

68
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:19,413
Tom Paris?

69
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:24,413
Kathryn Janeway.

70
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,924
l served with your father
on the Al-Batani.

71
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:30,429
l wonder if we could
go somewhere and talk?

72
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,293
About what?

73
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:34,833
About a job we'd like
you to do for us.

74
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:37,335
l'm already doing a job...

75
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:38,734
for the Federation.

76
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:40,670
l've been told
the Rehab Commission

77
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,571
is very pleased with your work.

78
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:45,975
They've given me their approval
to discuss this matter with you.

79
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:48,980
Well, then l guess l'm yours.

80
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:54,481
Your father taught me
a great deal.

81
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:57,648
l was his Science Officer
during the Arias Expedition.

82
00:05:57,724 --> 00:05:59,692
You must be good.

83
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,557
My father only accepts
the best and the brightest.

84
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:05,529
l'm leaving on a mission
to find a Maquis ship

85
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:08,363
that disappeared in
the Badlands a week ago.

86
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:10,595
l wouldn't, if l were you.

87
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:11,967
Really?

88
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:14,563
l've never seen
a Federation starship

89
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,631
that could maneuver
through the plasma storms.

90
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:19,041
You've never seen Voyager.

91
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,707
We'd like you to come along.

92
00:06:23,182 --> 00:06:26,982
You'd like me to lead you
to my former colleagues.

93
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:29,913
l was only with the Maquis
a few weeks

94
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:31,387
before l was captured, Captain.

95
00:06:31,457 --> 00:06:34,153
l don't know where most
of their hiding places are.

96
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:37,196
You know the territory
better than anyone we've got.

97
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:40,721
What's so important about
this particular Maquis ship?

98
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,258
My Chief of Security
was on board-- undercover.

99
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:47,397
He was supposed to report in
twice during the last six days.

100
00:06:47,473 --> 00:06:48,906
He didn't.

101
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:52,172
Maybe it's just your Chief
of Security who's disappeared.

102
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,577
Maybe.

103
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:57,113
That ship was under the command

104
00:06:57,183 --> 00:06:58,172
of another former

105
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,718
Starfleet officer

106
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:01,048
named Chakotay.

107
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:04,283
l understand you knew him.

108
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:06,848
That's right.

109
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:10,157
The two of you didn't get along
too well, l'm told.

110
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:13,062
Chakotay will tell you
he left Starfleet on principle--

111
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:16,727
to defend his home colony
from the Cardassians.

112
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:19,033
l, on the other hand,
was forced to resign.

113
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,232
He considered me a mercenary--

114
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:24,140
willing to fight for anyone
who'd pay my bar bills.

115
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:27,145
The trouble is he was right.

116
00:07:30,316 --> 00:07:32,284
l have no problem helping you

117
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:35,479
track down my ''friends''
in the Maquis, Captain.

118
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:39,150
All l need to know from you
is what's in it for me?

119
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:41,022
You help us find that ship

120
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:44,153
we help you
at your next outmate review.

121
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:46,130
Uh-huh.

122
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,359
Officially, you'd be

123
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:49,424
a Starfleet observer
during the mission.

124
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:51,094
Observer?!

125
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:55,130
Oh, hell, l'm the best pilot
you could have.

126
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:57,108
You'll be an observer.

127
00:07:57,176 --> 00:08:00,111
When it's over,
you're cut loose.

128
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:02,670
Story of my life.

129
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:19,790
Stadi, you're changing
my mind about Betazoids.

130
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:21,595
Good.

131
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,601
Oh, that wasn't a compliment.

132
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:29,005
Until today, l always considered
your people warm and sensual.

133
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:31,908
l can be warm and sensual.

134
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:33,275
Just not to me.

135
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:36,338
Do you always fly at women
at warp speed, Mr. Paris?

136
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:39,145
Only when they're
in visual range.

137
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:43,847
That's our ship.

138
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:45,481
That's Voyager.

139
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:47,150
lntrepid-class--

140
00:08:47,226 --> 00:08:49,558
sustainable cruise
velocity of warp factor

141
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:51,722
9.97 5.

142
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:55,927
15 decks,
crew complement of 141.

143
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:57,970
Bio-neural circuitry.

144
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:59,594
Bio-neural?

145
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:00,661
Some of the traditional

146
00:09:00,773 --> 00:09:03,298
circuitry has been
replaced by gel packs

147
00:09:03,342 --> 00:09:05,276
that contain bio-neural cells.

148
00:09:05,344 --> 00:09:07,574
They organize information
more efficiently--

149
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:09,581
speed up response time.

150
00:09:32,004 --> 00:09:34,996
lf l may say so,
it's been my special pleasure

151
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:37,167
to see many new officers
like yourself

152
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,006
come through these portals.

153
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:42,172
Your parents must be
very proud, my boy.

154
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:45,115
You know, on an occasion
like this...

155
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:46,242
l'm really not interested.

156
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:47,513
lnterested?

157
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,384
You were about to try
to sell me something, right?

158
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:51,082
l was merely going to suggest

159
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:53,284
that your parents
might appreciate a memento

160
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:54,291
of your first mission.

161
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,794
And you happen to have several
to choose from?

162
00:09:56,862 --> 00:09:59,592
l do carry a select line

163
00:09:59,665 --> 00:10:02,259
of unique artifacts
and gemstones

164
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:04,030
indigenous to this region.

165
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:08,164
Why, quite recently,
l acquired these Lobi crystals

166
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,266
from a very strange creature
called a Morn.

167
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:13,904
We were warned about the Ferengi
at the Academy.

168
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:16,973
Warned about Ferengi, were you?

169
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,448
That's right.

170
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:21,975
Slurs about my people
at Starfleet Academy.

171
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:22,986
What l meant was...

172
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:26,752
Here l am, trying to be
a cordial host, knowing

173
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:29,795
how much a young officer's
parents would appreciate

174
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:32,956
a token of his love on the eve
of a dangerous mission

175
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:35,125
and what do l get
for my trouble?

176
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:37,328
Scurrilous insults.

177
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:40,998
Well, somebody's
going to hear about this.

178
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:43,371
What's your name, son?

179
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:45,342
My... name?

180
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:46,503
You have one, l presume?

181
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:47,705
Kim, Harry Kim, but l...

182
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:48,769
And who was it

183
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:51,681
at the Academy who warned you
about Ferengi?

184
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:53,446
You know, l think
a memento for my parents

185
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:54,451
would be a great idea.

186
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,953
Oh, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no!

187
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:57,717
Really, one of these

188
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,223
would make a great pendant
for my mother.

189
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:00,451
Or cufflinks for your father.

190
00:11:00,526 --> 00:11:02,494
Cufflinks.
Great idea.

191
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:04,358
They're not for sale.

192
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:08,264
Now, inform
your commanding officer

193
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:12,168
that the Federation Council
can expect an official query...

194
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:13,830
How much for the entire tray?

195
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:17,509
Cash or credit?

196
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:19,441
Dazzling, aren't they?

197
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,537
As bright as a Koladan diamond.

198
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:22,876
Brighter.

199
00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:24,279
Hard to believe
you can find them

200
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,578
on any planet in the system.

201
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:26,675
That's an exaggeration.

202
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:29,949
You know, there's a shop
at the Volnar Colony

203
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,990
that sells
a dozen assorted shapes

204
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:33,491
for one Cardassian lek.

205
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:35,720
How much are you
selling these for?

206
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:38,628
We were just about
to negotiate the price.

207
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:43,760
Come on.

208
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,175
Thanks.

209
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:53,473
Didn't they warn you about
Ferengi at the Academy?

210
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:03,715
Run a level-3 diagnostic
just to be sure.

211
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:06,916
Can l help you?

212
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:09,290
Tom Paris, reporting on board.

213
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:10,726
Oh, yes.

214
00:12:10,796 --> 00:12:13,094
The observer.

215
00:12:13,165 --> 00:12:14,462
That's me.

216
00:12:16,702 --> 00:12:18,932
As a matter of fact,
l seem to be observing

217
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:21,165
some kind of problem
right now...

218
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,935
Doctor.

219
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:26,910
l was a surgeon
at the hospital on Caldik Prime

220
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:29,743
the same time you were
stationed there.

221
00:12:29,815 --> 00:12:31,305
We never actually met.

222
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:34,952
Your medical records
have arrived

223
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,510
from your last posting,
Mr. Paris.

224
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,989
Everything seems to be
in order.

225
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:41,788
The Captain asked
if you were on board.

226
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:42,919
You should check in with her.

227
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:44,360
Uh...

228
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,421
l haven't paid my respects
to the Captain yet either.

229
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:49,662
Well, Mr. Kim,
that would be a good thing

230
00:12:49,735 --> 00:12:51,703
for a new
Operations Officer to do.

231
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:57,935
What was that all about?

232
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,136
lt's a long story, Harry

233
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:00,405
and l'm tired of telling it.

234
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:02,674
l'm sure someone around here
will tell you before long.

235
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:04,705
The doctor called.

236
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:05,716
And?

237
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:06,809
And l was right.

238
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:08,012
She's pregnant?

239
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:09,611
Puppies are due in seven weeks.

240
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:11,087
Oh, Mark, you've got
to take her home with you.

241
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:13,022
With me?

242
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:14,423
l just got the rugs cleaned.

243
00:13:14,493 --> 00:13:15,460
She's with child.

244
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:17,086
l can't leave her
in a kennel while l...

245
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:19,757
ls this another ''love me,
love my dog'' demand?

246
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:21,094
Yes.

247
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:22,464
How could l ever refuse you?

248
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:23,695
Thanks, honey.

249
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:25,100
So when are you leaving?

250
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:27,639
As soon as l approve
these system status reports.

251
00:13:27,706 --> 00:13:30,641
All right, then l won't
bother you anymore.

252
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:32,142
Hey...

253
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,880
you never bother me.

254
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:39,816
Except the way l love
to be bothered.

255
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:40,817
Understand?

256
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:42,649
l'll remember that.

257
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:44,416
See you in a few weeks.

258
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,287
Oh, Mark, go by my house
and pick up the doggy bed.

259
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:47,655
She'll be more comfortable.

260
00:13:47,726 --> 00:13:49,421
l already did.

261
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,622
An hour ago.

262
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:02,666
Come in.

263
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:08,843
Gentlemen,
welcome aboard Voyager.

264
00:14:08,914 --> 00:14:09,881
Thank you, sir.

265
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,246
Mr. Kim...

266
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:15,947
at ease
before you sprain something.

267
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:19,487
Ensign, despite
Starfleet protocol

268
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:21,617
l don't like being
addressed as ''sir.''

269
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,889
l'm sorry... ma'am.

270
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:25,863
''Ma'am'' is acceptable
in a crunch,

271
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:27,489
but l prefer ''Captain.''

272
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:29,898
We're getting ready to leave.

273
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:31,436
Let me show you to the Bridge.

274
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:34,131
Did you have any problems
getting here, Mr. Paris?

275
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:36,265
None at all, Captain.

276
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:40,946
My First Officer,
Lieutenant Commander Cavit.

277
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,378
Ensign Kim, Mr. Paris.

278
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:44,575
Welcome aboard.

279
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:54,750
Ensign Kim,
this is your station.

280
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:57,924
Would you like to take over?

281
00:14:57,997 --> 00:14:59,828
Yes, ma'am.

282
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,129
lt's not crunch time yet,
Mr. Kim.

283
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:03,599
l'll let you know when.

284
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:09,864
Lieutenant Stadi,
lay in the course

285
00:15:09,975 --> 00:15:11,966
and clear our departure
with Operations.

286
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:14,444
Course entered,
Ops has cleared us.

287
00:15:14,513 --> 00:15:16,242
Ready thrusters.

288
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:17,441
Thrusters ready.

289
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:19,541
lnitiate launching sequence.

290
00:15:19,618 --> 00:15:21,916
Sequence underway.

291
00:15:21,987 --> 00:15:23,011
Engage.

292
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:05,362
Tomato soup.

293
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:08,696
There are 14 varieties
of tomato soup available

294
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:12,203
from this replicator--
with rice, with vegetables,

295
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:14,364
Bolian-style,
with pasta, with...

296
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,407
Plain.

297
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,669
Specify hot or chilled.

298
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:19,005
Hot!

299
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:21,512
Hot, plain tomato soup.

300
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:36,116
There, you see?

301
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:38,060
l told you
it wouldn't take long.

302
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:41,363
ls it true?

303
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:43,128
Was the accident my fault?

304
00:16:43,202 --> 00:16:44,829
Yes-- pilot error--

305
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:47,929
but it took me
a while to admit it.

306
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,142
Ugh! 14 varieties

307
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:53,906
and they can't even get
plain tomato soup right.

308
00:16:53,979 --> 00:16:56,072
They said you falsified reports.

309
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:57,172
That's right.

310
00:16:57,249 --> 00:16:58,216
Why?

311
00:16:58,283 --> 00:17:00,080
What's the difference?
l lied.

312
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:01,414
But then you came forward

313
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:03,512
and you admitted
that it was your fault?

314
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:07,957
l'll tell you the truth, Harry.

315
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:11,155
All l had to do
was keep my mouth shut

316
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:13,095
and l was home free...

317
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:14,189
but l couldn't.

318
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:17,429
The ghosts of those
three dead officers

319
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:19,061
came to me
in the middle of the night

320
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:21,072
and taught me
the true meaning of Christmas.

321
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,506
So l confessed--

322
00:17:23,575 --> 00:17:27,671
worst mistake l ever made
but not my last.

323
00:17:27,746 --> 00:17:30,772
After they cashiered me
out of Starfleet,

324
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:33,682
l went out looking for a fight
and found the Maquis,

325
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:38,519
and on my first assignment,
l was caught.

326
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:41,718
That must have been
especially tough for you,

327
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:43,659
being the son of an admiral.

328
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:48,132
Frankly, l think it was tougher
on my father than it was on me.

329
00:17:52,037 --> 00:17:53,265
Look.

330
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:55,306
l know those guys told you
to stay away from me,

331
00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:56,932
and you know what?

332
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,907
You ought to listen to them.

333
00:17:58,977 --> 00:18:02,310
l'm not exactly
a good-luck charm.

334
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:05,913
l don't need anyone
to choose my friends for me.

335
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:09,019
Janeway to Paris.

336
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,419
Go ahead.

337
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:11,581
Report to the Bridge.

338
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:12,988
We're approaching the Badlands.

339
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:25,097
The plasma storms were measured
at levels three and four.

340
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,331
The Cardassians gave us
the last known heading

341
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:30,034
of the Maquis ship,
and we have charts

342
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,634
of the plasma storm activity
the day it disappeared.

343
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:33,905
With a little help,

344
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:35,776
we might be able to
approximate its course.

345
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:36,780
l'd guess

346
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:38,646
they were trying to get
to one of the M-Class

347
00:18:38,717 --> 00:18:40,742
planetoids in the Terikof Belt.

348
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:42,343
That's beyond the Moriya system

349
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:45,549
The plasma storms would have
forced them in this direction.

350
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:47,785
Adjust our course to match.

351
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:48,792
Aye, Captain.

352
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:50,226
The Cardassians claim
they forced

353
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:52,160
the Maquis ship
into a plasma storm

354
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:53,630
where it was destroyed,

355
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:55,530
but our probes haven't
picked up any debris.

356
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:58,365
A plasma storm might not leave
any debris.

357
00:18:58,437 --> 00:18:59,802
We'd still be able to pick up

358
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:01,533
a resonance trace
from the warp core.

359
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,834
Captain.

360
00:19:02,941 --> 00:19:04,966
l'm reading a coherent
tetryon beam scanning us.

361
00:19:05,043 --> 00:19:06,738
Origin, Mr. Kim?

362
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:07,779
l'm not sure.

363
00:19:07,846 --> 00:19:09,473
There's also a displacement wave
moving toward us.

364
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:11,140
On screen.

365
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:15,183
Analysis.

366
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:18,087
Some kind of polarized
magnetic variation.

367
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,853
We might be able to disperse it
with a graviton particle field.

368
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:22,052
Do it.

369
00:19:22,127 --> 00:19:23,219
Red Alert.

370
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:24,694
Move us away from it,
Lieutenant.

371
00:19:24,763 --> 00:19:27,755
New heading 41 mark 180.

372
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:34,498
lnitiating graviton field.

373
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:38,800
The graviton field
had no effect.

374
00:19:38,877 --> 00:19:40,970
Full impulse.

375
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,678
The wave will intercept us
in 12 seconds.

376
00:19:46,752 --> 00:19:48,242
Can we go to warp?

377
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,584
Not until we clear
the plasma field, Captain.

378
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:52,590
Five seconds.

379
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:54,148
Brace for impact.

380
00:19:54,226 --> 00:19:55,022
Three...

381
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:32,254
Report.

382
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:34,930
Hull breach, deck 14.

383
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,262
Com lines
to Engineering are down.

384
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:37,597
Trying to reestablish.

385
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:43,203
Repair crews, seal off
hull breach on deck 14.

386
00:20:43,275 --> 00:20:44,264
Aye, Captain.

387
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:46,311
Casualty reports coming in.

388
00:20:46,378 --> 00:20:48,039
Sick Bay is not responding.

389
00:20:48,113 --> 00:20:49,171
Bridge to Sick Bay.

390
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,738
Doctor, can you hear me?

391
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:53,875
Paris, how's Stadi?

392
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:55,886
She's dead.

393
00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:57,251
Captain, there's
something out there.

394
00:20:57,322 --> 00:20:59,984
l need a better description
than that, Mr. Kim.

395
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:01,116
l don't know.

396
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:02,456
l'm reading...

397
00:21:02,494 --> 00:21:03,791
l'm not sure what l'm reading.

398
00:21:03,862 --> 00:21:05,659
Can you get
the viewscreen operational?

399
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:07,221
l'm trying.

400
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:24,109
Captain,
if these sensors are working

401
00:21:24,182 --> 00:21:27,117
we're over 70,000 light-years
from where we were.

402
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:30,018
We're on the other side
of the galaxy.

403
00:21:41,366 --> 00:21:43,834
l'm not reading any life signs
on the Maquis ship.

404
00:21:43,902 --> 00:21:46,530
What about on that...
that Array?

405
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:48,505
Our sensors can't penetrate it.

406
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:49,870
Any idea what those pulses are

407
00:21:49,941 --> 00:21:51,374
that are coming from it,
Mr. Kim?

408
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:52,535
Massive bursts
of radiant energy.

409
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:53,600
They seem to be directed

410
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,146
toward a nearby
G-type star system.

411
00:21:55,213 --> 00:21:56,840
Try hailing the Array.

412
00:21:56,915 --> 00:21:58,382
Engineering to Bridge.

413
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:00,441
We have severe damage.
The chief's dead.

414
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:02,350
Possibility
of a warp core breach.

415
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:05,015
Secure all engineering systems.
l'm on my way.

416
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:06,148
No response from the Array.

417
00:22:06,224 --> 00:22:07,919
Ensign, get down to Sick Bay.
See what's going on.

418
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:09,358
Mr. Rollins,
the Bridge is yours.

419
00:22:09,428 --> 00:22:10,918
Aye, Captain.

420
00:22:14,766 --> 00:22:16,097
Harry, wait for me.

421
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:34,410
They must have been

422
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:36,113
right next to the console
when it exploded.

423
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:51,798
Warning.
Warp core micro-fracture.

424
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,201
Breach imminent.

425
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:56,307
What's the warp core pressure?

426
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,842
2,100 kilopascals.

427
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:01,602
Lock down
the magnetic constrictors.

428
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:03,943
lf we lock them down
at these pressure levels,

429
00:23:03,982 --> 00:23:05,415
we might not be able
to reinitialize

430
00:23:05,484 --> 00:23:06,416
the dilithium reaction.

431
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:07,645
Warning.

432
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:09,516
Warp core microfracture.
Breach imminent.

433
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:10,520
We don't have a choice.

434
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:11,749
We've got to get
the reaction rate

435
00:23:11,823 --> 00:23:13,814
down
before we try to seal it.

436
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:15,760
Computer, initiate

437
00:23:15,827 --> 00:23:17,454
emergency medical
holographic program.

438
00:23:20,465 --> 00:23:23,059
Please state the nature
of the medical emergency.

439
00:23:23,135 --> 00:23:24,261
Multiple percussive injuries.

440
00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:25,360
Status of your doctor?

441
00:23:25,437 --> 00:23:26,404
He's dead.

442
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:27,699
.4cc's of trianoline.

443
00:23:27,773 --> 00:23:29,240
Trianoline?

444
00:23:29,307 --> 00:23:31,002
We lost our nurse, too.

445
00:23:32,444 --> 00:23:34,708
How soon are replacement
medical personnel expected?

446
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,270
That could be a problem.

447
00:23:36,348 --> 00:23:38,339
We're pretty far away
from replacements right now.

448
00:23:40,051 --> 00:23:41,313
Tricorder.

449
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:47,315
Medical tricorder.

450
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:58,225
A replacement must be requested
as soon as possible.

451
00:23:58,303 --> 00:23:59,895
l am programmed
only as a short-term

452
00:23:59,971 --> 00:24:01,836
emergency supplement
to the medical team.

453
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,875
Well, we may be stuck
with you for a while, Doc.

454
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:06,571
There's no need for concern.

455
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:09,239
l am capable of treating
any injury or disease.

456
00:24:09,314 --> 00:24:10,440
No concussion.
You'll be fine.

457
00:24:10,515 --> 00:24:11,504
Clean him up.

458
00:24:21,893 --> 00:24:23,758
Unlock the magnetic
constrictors.

459
00:24:28,433 --> 00:24:29,593
Constrictors on line.

460
00:24:29,668 --> 00:24:30,930
Pressure?

461
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:32,094
lt's working.

462
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:35,139
2,500 kilopascals and holding.

463
00:24:35,207 --> 00:24:36,174
Bridge to Janeway.

464
00:24:36,241 --> 00:24:38,300
We're being scanned
by the Array, Captain.

465
00:24:38,376 --> 00:24:40,276
lt's penetrated our shields.

466
00:24:40,345 --> 00:24:41,277
What kind of scan?

467
00:24:42,347 --> 00:24:43,314
Bridge?

468
00:24:43,381 --> 00:24:44,575
Janeway to Bridge.
Respond.

469
00:24:47,118 --> 00:24:48,983
lnitiate emergency lock off.

470
00:24:56,261 --> 00:24:59,162
You're not seriously hurt.
You can return to your station.

471
00:25:09,374 --> 00:25:11,865
This is the emergency
holographic doctor speaking.

472
00:25:11,943 --> 00:25:12,910
l gave no permission

473
00:25:12,978 --> 00:25:14,969
for anyone to be transported
out of Sick Bay.

474
00:25:17,215 --> 00:25:18,614
Hello.

475
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:20,241
Sick Bay to Bridge.

476
00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:25,519
l believe someone has failed
to terminate my program.

477
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:26,750
Please respond.

478
00:25:41,072 --> 00:25:42,903
Come up here.

479
00:25:42,974 --> 00:25:43,906
Come on now.

480
00:25:43,975 --> 00:25:45,806
l have a pitcher

481
00:25:45,977 --> 00:25:48,343
of lemonade
and some sugar cookies.

482
00:25:53,985 --> 00:25:54,974
Captain?

483
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:56,816
Don't believe your eyes,
Mr. Paris.

484
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:58,981
We've only transported
100 kilometers.

485
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:01,355
We're inside the Array.

486
00:26:01,459 --> 00:26:03,893
There's no indication
of stable matter.

487
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:06,727
All this must be some kind
of holographic projection.

488
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:09,096
Oh, you poor things.
You must be tired out.

489
00:26:09,167 --> 00:26:11,431
But come on and sit down
and rest a while.

490
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:12,697
Have a cold drink, hmm?

491
00:26:12,771 --> 00:26:14,261
No, thank you.

492
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:16,534
My name is Kathryn Janeway,

493
00:26:16,608 --> 00:26:19,133
Captain of the Federation
Starship Voyager.

494
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:21,872
Now just make yourselves
right at home.

495
00:26:22,013 --> 00:26:24,345
The neighbors should
be here any minute.

496
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:25,849
Oh. Why, here they are.

497
00:26:27,185 --> 00:26:28,152
Howdy.

498
00:26:28,219 --> 00:26:29,811
Welcome, folks.

499
00:26:29,888 --> 00:26:31,287
Hey.

500
00:26:31,356 --> 00:26:34,325
Well, good to see you.
Welcome.

501
00:26:34,392 --> 00:26:36,121
We're real glad you dropped by.

502
00:26:36,194 --> 00:26:37,923
Now we can get started.

503
00:26:37,996 --> 00:26:42,126
You're all invited
to the welcoming bee!

504
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,929
Let's have some music!

505
00:26:49,975 --> 00:26:51,567
Yoo-hoo!

506
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:18,533
The crew's scattered
around this farm, Captain,

507
00:27:18,603 --> 00:27:20,628
but they're all accounted for.

508
00:27:20,705 --> 00:27:22,832
Move around.
Scan the area.

509
00:27:22,907 --> 00:27:24,169
See if you can find anything

510
00:27:24,242 --> 00:27:26,142
that might be
a holographic generator.

511
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:30,212
Have some nice fresh
corn on the cob.

512
00:27:30,281 --> 00:27:33,773
Fresh corn on the cob.

513
00:27:33,852 --> 00:27:37,288
Corn on the cob?
Corn on the cob?

514
00:27:37,355 --> 00:27:39,084
Can you tell me why we're here?

515
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:41,125
Oh, we don't mean you any harm.

516
00:27:41,192 --> 00:27:43,660
l'm sorry if we've put you out.

517
00:27:43,728 --> 00:27:45,286
Why don't you just
put your feet up

518
00:27:45,363 --> 00:27:46,921
and get comfortable
while you wait?

519
00:27:47,032 --> 00:27:48,590
Wait for what?

520
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:51,261
lsn't anybody hungry?

521
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:53,566
Come on, now.
Make yourselves at home.

522
00:27:53,638 --> 00:27:55,902
l'm sorry if we've put you out.

523
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,410
Hey, let me show you around.

524
00:28:10,488 --> 00:28:11,887
The root cellar's
right over there.

525
00:28:12,891 --> 00:28:14,017
What's down there?

526
00:28:14,092 --> 00:28:15,616
Potatoes, onions.

527
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:17,389
But it's real private.

528
00:28:17,462 --> 00:28:18,759
Hmm.

529
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:21,128
Paris, she's only a hologram.

530
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:22,757
No reason to be rude.

531
00:28:23,968 --> 00:28:24,957
Whoa.

532
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:25,968
What?

533
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:27,504
Sporocystian life signs.

534
00:28:33,845 --> 00:28:35,312
What's in the barn?

535
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,507
Oh, nothing
but a big ol' pile of hay.

536
00:28:37,582 --> 00:28:39,345
Hey, come on! Let's
go see the duck pond.

537
00:28:39,417 --> 00:28:40,349
Nothing in there.

538
00:28:40,418 --> 00:28:42,750
lt's just a dark, smelly barn.

539
00:28:42,821 --> 00:28:45,517
Hey, do y'all want
some deviled eggs?

540
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:46,887
Huh?

541
00:28:52,163 --> 00:28:54,688
See? Nothing but hay.

542
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:56,324
There's a life-form here.

543
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:57,891
-Just one.
-Where?

544
00:28:57,969 --> 00:28:59,061
lt's everywhere.

545
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:03,503
l'm also reading some kind
of matrix processing device.

546
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:05,042
lt may be
the holographic generator.

547
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:08,808
Paris.

548
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,711
Humanoid life signs over here.

549
00:29:10,782 --> 00:29:14,809
l'm reading a Vulcan
and several humans.

550
00:29:14,886 --> 00:29:17,548
l'm not ready for you yet!

551
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:24,454
Paris to Janeway.

552
00:29:26,064 --> 00:29:27,031
Janeway here.

553
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:28,258
Paris?

554
00:29:29,801 --> 00:29:30,790
Come on.

555
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:51,922
Very well.

556
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:54,618
Since no one seems
to care for any corn,

557
00:29:54,692 --> 00:29:57,183
we'll have to proceed
ahead of schedule.

558
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:30,411
Janeway to Bridge.
Anybody there?

559
00:31:30,488 --> 00:31:32,456
Yes, Captain, we're here.

560
00:31:32,523 --> 00:31:33,854
How long were we over there?

561
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:37,092
Almost three days.

562
00:31:37,161 --> 00:31:38,389
Three days!

563
00:31:38,463 --> 00:31:42,297
Captain, the Maquis ship
is powering up its engines.

564
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:43,994
Tractor them.
All senior officers report

565
00:31:44,102 --> 00:31:45,296
to the Bridge immediately.

566
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:48,601
Excuse me, could you explain
what has transpired?

567
00:31:48,673 --> 00:31:50,140
Computer, locate Ensign Kim.

568
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:52,267
Ensign Kim is not on board.

569
00:31:52,343 --> 00:31:54,174
Uh, Paris to Janeway.

570
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:56,008
Go ahead.

571
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,275
Kim didn't come back with us.
He must still be over there.

572
00:31:58,349 --> 00:31:59,316
Acknowledged.

573
00:31:59,384 --> 00:32:01,181
Computer, how many crewmen
are unaccounted for?

574
00:32:01,286 --> 00:32:03,151
One: Ensign Harry Kim.

575
00:32:03,187 --> 00:32:04,620
Hail the Maquis.

576
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:07,747
Commander Chakotay,

577
00:32:07,825 --> 00:32:10,259
my name is
Captain Kathryn Janeway.

578
00:32:10,328 --> 00:32:11,727
How do you know my name?

579
00:32:11,796 --> 00:32:13,229
We were on a mission
to find you

580
00:32:13,298 --> 00:32:15,129
when we were brought here
by the Array.

581
00:32:15,199 --> 00:32:17,292
One of our crewmen is missing.

582
00:32:17,368 --> 00:32:20,132
Was he transported back
to your ship by accident?

583
00:32:20,204 --> 00:32:23,071
No. A member of our crew
is missing, too.

584
00:32:23,141 --> 00:32:25,769
B'Elanna Torres, my Engineer.

585
00:32:25,843 --> 00:32:28,607
Commander, you and l
have the same problem.

586
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,669
l think it makes sense

587
00:32:29,747 --> 00:32:31,715
to try and solve it together,
don't you?

588
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:39,681
Three of us will transport
to your ship.

589
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:41,990
They're powering down
their engines

590
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,049
dropping their shields.

591
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,233
Watch out, Captain.
They're armed.

592
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:53,303
Put down your weapons.

593
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,965
You won't need those here.

594
00:32:59,444 --> 00:33:01,207
lt's good to have you back,
Mr. Tuvok.

595
00:33:02,847 --> 00:33:05,077
l must inform you
that l was assigned

596
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:06,878
to infiltrate your crew, sir.

597
00:33:06,951 --> 00:33:09,249
l am Captain Janeway's
Chief of Security.

598
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:13,051
Were you going to deliver us

599
00:33:13,124 --> 00:33:15,092
into their waiting hands,
Vulcan?

600
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:18,219
My mission was
to accumulate information

601
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:19,923
on Maquis activities

602
00:33:20,031 --> 00:33:22,829
and then deliver you
into their ''waiting hands.''

603
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:23,832
That is correct.

604
00:33:23,901 --> 00:33:25,630
l see you had help.

605
00:33:25,703 --> 00:33:29,571
lt's good to see you, too,
Chakotay.

606
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:32,234
At least the Vulcan was doing
his duty as a Starfleet officer,

607
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:33,538
but you...

608
00:33:33,611 --> 00:33:35,340
you betrayed us for what?

609
00:33:35,413 --> 00:33:38,576
Freedom from prison?
Latinum?

610
00:33:38,649 --> 00:33:40,981
What was your price this time?!

611
00:33:41,052 --> 00:33:43,111
You are speaking
to a member of my crew.

612
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:45,212
l expect you to treat him
with the same respect

613
00:33:45,289 --> 00:33:47,655
as you would have me
treat a member of yours.

614
00:33:52,663 --> 00:33:56,394
Now, we have a lot to accomplish
and l suggest we all concentrate

615
00:33:56,467 --> 00:33:59,732
on finding our people
and getting ourselves back home.

616
00:33:59,804 --> 00:34:00,828
Based on my initial

617
00:34:00,938 --> 00:34:03,771
reconnaissance, Captain
l am convinced we are dealing

618
00:34:03,808 --> 00:34:05,776
with a single entity
in the Array.

619
00:34:05,843 --> 00:34:08,141
l would suggest
he scanned our computers

620
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:11,306
in order to select a comfortable
holographic environment.

621
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:13,282
ln effect, a waiting room

622
00:34:13,351 --> 00:34:16,787
to pacify us prior
to biometric assessment.

623
00:34:16,854 --> 00:34:18,412
An examination?

624
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:20,923
lt is the most
logical explanation.

625
00:34:21,025 --> 00:34:23,289
Why else would he have
released us unharmed?

626
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:25,556
Not all of us were.

627
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:29,832
Break out the compression
phaser rifles.

628
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:31,562
Meet us in Transporter Room 2.

629
00:34:31,636 --> 00:34:33,627
We're going back.

630
00:34:33,704 --> 00:34:35,433
We'll divide into teams.

631
00:34:35,506 --> 00:34:37,974
Mr. Tuvok, while Chakotay
and l are looking for Torres

632
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,771
and, Kim, your job
is to find out

633
00:34:39,844 --> 00:34:42,312
as much about this Array
as you can.

634
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:43,312
lt brought us here.

635
00:34:43,381 --> 00:34:45,178
We have to assume
it can send us home.

636
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:48,218
Agreed?

637
00:34:51,823 --> 00:34:54,485
Mr. Rollins, maintain Red Alert.

638
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:56,618
Keep us on constant
transporter locks.

639
00:34:56,694 --> 00:34:57,661
Captain.

640
00:35:01,132 --> 00:35:02,292
l'd like to go with you.

641
00:35:02,366 --> 00:35:04,027
lf this has something
to do with what Chakotay...

642
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:06,297
lt doesn't.
l just...

643
00:35:07,638 --> 00:35:10,129
l'd hate to see
anything happen to Harry.

644
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:13,268
Come on.

645
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:39,235
There are no humanoid
life-forms indicated, Captain.

646
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:41,635
Kim and Torres are not
within tricorder range.

647
00:35:41,706 --> 00:35:43,196
They may not be on the Array.

648
00:35:43,274 --> 00:35:44,866
He can tell us where they are.

649
00:35:44,942 --> 00:35:46,671
Maintain your com link.

650
00:35:46,744 --> 00:35:48,871
l don't want
to lose anyone else.

651
00:36:01,292 --> 00:36:03,226
Oh, why have you come back?

652
00:36:03,294 --> 00:36:05,228
You don't have what l need.

653
00:36:05,396 --> 00:36:07,864
l don't know what you need
and, frankly, l don't care.

654
00:36:07,932 --> 00:36:09,331
l just want our people back

655
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,265
and l want us all
to be sent home.

656
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:14,133
Oh, well, now,
aren't you contentious

657
00:36:14,205 --> 00:36:16,969
for a minor bipedal species.

658
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:20,234
This minor bipedal species

659
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:22,336
doesn't take kindly
to being abducted.

660
00:36:22,413 --> 00:36:24,142
Oh, it was necessary.

661
00:36:24,215 --> 00:36:25,580
Where are our people?

662
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:26,639
They are no longer here.

663
00:36:26,717 --> 00:36:28,116
What have you done to them?

664
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:30,746
You don't have what l need.

665
00:36:30,821 --> 00:36:32,186
They might.

666
00:36:32,256 --> 00:36:33,621
No. You'll have to leave them.

667
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:34,715
We won't do that.

668
00:36:34,792 --> 00:36:36,726
We are their commanding
officers.

669
00:36:36,794 --> 00:36:38,386
We are entrusted
with their safety.

670
00:36:38,462 --> 00:36:40,453
They are our responsibility.

671
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:42,931
That may be a concept
you don't understand.

672
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,367
Oh, no, l do understand,

673
00:36:46,437 --> 00:36:49,099
but l have no choice.

674
00:36:49,173 --> 00:36:51,869
Oh...

675
00:36:51,943 --> 00:36:54,935
There just is
not enough time left.

676
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:56,671
Left for what?

677
00:36:56,747 --> 00:37:00,012
l must honor a debt
that can never be repaid,

678
00:37:00,084 --> 00:37:03,520
but my search has
not been going well.

679
00:37:06,958 --> 00:37:09,392
Tell us what you're looking for.

680
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:11,189
Maybe we can help you find it.

681
00:37:11,262 --> 00:37:12,695
You?

682
00:37:14,465 --> 00:37:15,727
l've searched the galaxy

683
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,825
with methods
beyond your comprehension.

684
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:20,029
No. There's nothing you can do.

685
00:37:20,104 --> 00:37:23,835
You've taken us 70,000
light-years from our home.

686
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:25,876
We have no way back
unless you send us

687
00:37:25,977 --> 00:37:27,911
and we won't leave
without the others.

688
00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:32,416
But... sending you back
is terribly complicated.

689
00:37:32,483 --> 00:37:33,916
Don't you understand?

690
00:37:33,985 --> 00:37:36,283
l don't have time.

691
00:37:36,354 --> 00:37:38,914
Not enough time!

692
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:10,420
He's regaining consciousness.

693
00:38:12,223 --> 00:38:13,815
How do you feel?

694
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:16,851
What am l doing here?

695
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,053
Where am l?

696
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:20,290
Please don't try to move yet.

697
00:38:20,364 --> 00:38:21,592
You're very ill.

698
00:38:21,666 --> 00:38:22,758
lll? No, no,
there's some mistake,

699
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:23,891
l'm not...

700
00:38:34,345 --> 00:38:35,437
No!

701
00:39:21,158 --> 00:39:25,390
Captain's Log, Stardate 48315.6.

702
00:39:25,463 --> 00:39:27,863
We've traced the energy pulses
from the Array

703
00:39:27,932 --> 00:39:30,730
to the fifth planet
of the neighboring system

704
00:39:30,801 --> 00:39:32,701
and believe they may have
been used in some fashion

705
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:36,365
to transport Kim and Torres
to the planet's surface.

706
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:42,643
Come in.

707
00:39:44,782 --> 00:39:48,445
Captain, l've observed something
peculiar about the pulses.

708
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:50,350
They're getting faster.

709
00:39:51,856 --> 00:39:53,323
Faster.

710
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,086
The interval between each pulse

711
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:57,787
has decreased by .47
seconds since we arrived.

712
00:39:57,862 --> 00:39:59,796
l can offer no explanation.

713
00:39:59,864 --> 00:40:02,697
That's only one of the mysteries
we're dealing with, Mr. Tuvok.

714
00:40:02,767 --> 00:40:04,462
Take a look at this.

715
00:40:08,105 --> 00:40:10,403
lt's virtually a desert.

716
00:40:10,474 --> 00:40:11,566
Not one ocean.

717
00:40:11,642 --> 00:40:12,802
Not one river.

718
00:40:12,877 --> 00:40:14,708
lt has all the basic
characteristics

719
00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:16,371
of an M-Class planet, except...

720
00:40:18,048 --> 00:40:19,913
there are no
nucleogenic particles

721
00:40:19,984 --> 00:40:20,951
in the atmosphere.

722
00:40:21,018 --> 00:40:22,781
That would mean
the planet is incapable

723
00:40:22,853 --> 00:40:23,785
of producing rain.

724
00:40:23,854 --> 00:40:25,481
l've studied thousands
of M-Class planets.

725
00:40:25,556 --> 00:40:27,990
l've never seen an atmosphere
without nucleogenics.

726
00:40:28,058 --> 00:40:29,082
There must have been

727
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:32,357
some kind of extraordinary
environmental disaster.

728
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:41,738
As soon as repairs
are complete...

729
00:40:45,176 --> 00:40:47,736
we'll set a course
for the fifth planet.

730
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:53,481
Captain.

731
00:40:53,551 --> 00:40:55,849
You require sleep.

732
00:40:57,421 --> 00:41:00,083
Kim's mother called me
just after he left Earth.

733
00:41:00,157 --> 00:41:02,057
Delightful woman.

734
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:04,094
He's her only son.

735
00:41:04,161 --> 00:41:07,153
He'd left his clarinet behind.

736
00:41:07,231 --> 00:41:10,928
She wanted to know if she
had time to send it.

737
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:14,169
l had to tell her no.

738
00:41:16,273 --> 00:41:18,173
Do you know
he played the clarinet

739
00:41:18,242 --> 00:41:20,073
in the Juilliard Youth Symphony?

740
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:23,238
l did not have the opportunity
to meet Mr. Kim.

741
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:25,748
l barely knew him.

742
00:41:27,685 --> 00:41:30,711
l never seem to have the chance
to get to know any of them.

743
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:35,251
l have to, um...

744
00:41:37,027 --> 00:41:39,655
l have to take more time
to do that.

745
00:41:41,765 --> 00:41:44,791
lt's a fine crew
and l've got to get them home.

746
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:48,866
The crew will not benefit

747
00:41:48,939 --> 00:41:51,203
from the leadership
of an exhausted Captain.

748
00:41:54,044 --> 00:41:56,342
You're right as usual.

749
00:41:58,282 --> 00:41:59,909
l've missed your counsel, Tuvok.

750
00:41:59,984 --> 00:42:02,817
l am gratified
that you came after me

751
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,581
so l can offer it once again.

752
00:42:04,622 --> 00:42:07,318
l spoke to your family
before l left.

753
00:42:07,391 --> 00:42:09,689
Are they well?

754
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,251
Well, but worried about you.

755
00:42:12,329 --> 00:42:15,890
That would not be
an accurate perception, Captain.

756
00:42:15,966 --> 00:42:18,400
Vulcans do not worry.

757
00:42:18,469 --> 00:42:22,303
They... miss you.

758
00:42:24,008 --> 00:42:26,135
As l do them.

759
00:42:32,416 --> 00:42:34,316
l'll get you back to them.

760
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:36,012
That's a promise, Tuvok.

761
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:51,624
Captain's Log, supplemental.

762
00:42:51,702 --> 00:42:54,762
The Maquis ship and Voyager
have encountered a debris field

763
00:42:54,838 --> 00:42:56,965
where sensors have detected
a small vessel.

764
00:42:57,041 --> 00:42:59,566
One humanoid life-form
is on board.

765
00:42:59,643 --> 00:43:01,235
Hail them.

766
00:43:11,355 --> 00:43:15,587
Whoever you are, l found
this waste zone first.

767
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:18,822
We're not interested
in this debris, Mister...?

768
00:43:18,896 --> 00:43:21,330
Neelix.

769
00:43:21,398 --> 00:43:25,926
And since you're not interested
in my ''debris''

770
00:43:26,003 --> 00:43:28,938
well, l'm delighted to know you.

771
00:43:29,006 --> 00:43:30,530
Captain Kathryn Janeway

772
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:33,099
of the Federation
Starship Voyager.

773
00:43:33,177 --> 00:43:34,940
A very impressive title.

774
00:43:35,012 --> 00:43:37,071
l have no idea what it means,

775
00:43:37,147 --> 00:43:38,978
but it sounds very impressive.

776
00:43:39,083 --> 00:43:43,281
Do you know this area
of space well, Mr. Neelix?

777
00:43:43,354 --> 00:43:46,255
l am famous for knowing it well.

778
00:43:46,323 --> 00:43:48,223
How may l be of service?

779
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:50,157
Do you know anything
about the Array

780
00:43:50,227 --> 00:43:52,752
that's sending energy pulses
to the fifth planet?

781
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:56,766
l know enough to stay
as far away from it as possible.

782
00:43:56,834 --> 00:44:00,395
Wait, let me guess.

783
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:05,374
You were whisked away from
somewhere else in the galaxy

784
00:44:05,442 --> 00:44:07,842
and brought here
against your will.

785
00:44:07,911 --> 00:44:11,244
Sounds as though you've heard
this story before.

786
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:14,512
Sadly, yes, thousands of times.

787
00:44:14,585 --> 00:44:16,416
Well, hundreds of times.

788
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:18,580
Maybe 50 times.

789
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:19,884
But the Caretaker

790
00:44:19,957 --> 00:44:22,926
has been bringing ships here
for months now.

791
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:24,426
The Caretaker?

792
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:28,022
That's what the Ocampa call him.

793
00:44:28,098 --> 00:44:30,931
They live on the fifth planet.

794
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:34,801
Did he... kidnap members
of your crew?

795
00:44:34,872 --> 00:44:37,238
As a matter of fact, he did.

796
00:44:37,307 --> 00:44:39,639
lt's not the first time.

797
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:41,701
Do you know where
he might have taken them?

798
00:44:41,779 --> 00:44:44,771
Just that they're brought
to the Ocampa.

799
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:46,748
Nothing more.

800
00:44:46,817 --> 00:44:48,614
We'd appreciate any help
you could give us

801
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:50,916
in finding these... Ocampa.

802
00:44:50,988 --> 00:44:54,981
l-l-l really wish
that l could help you, l do.

803
00:44:55,059 --> 00:44:56,253
But as you can see,

804
00:44:56,326 --> 00:44:58,954
there's just so much debris
for me to investigate today.

805
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:04,057
You'd be surprised the things
of value some people abandon.

806
00:45:04,168 --> 00:45:06,864
Of course, we'd want to
compensate you for your trouble.

807
00:45:06,904 --> 00:45:11,170
Well, there's really very little
that you could offer me.

808
00:45:11,241 --> 00:45:14,210
Unless...

809
00:45:14,278 --> 00:45:15,745
Yes?

810
00:45:15,813 --> 00:45:18,145
Unless, of course,

811
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:20,206
you had...

812
00:45:20,284 --> 00:45:22,514
...water?

813
00:45:25,456 --> 00:45:28,220
lf you help us find
our missing crew members,

814
00:45:28,292 --> 00:45:30,886
you can have
all the water you want.

815
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:36,664
Well, tha-that sounds like
a very reasonable arrangement.

816
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:38,065
Good. We'll beam you over

817
00:45:38,135 --> 00:45:39,830
and tow your ship
into our shuttlebay.

818
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:43,395
Mr. Tuvok, go to Transporter
Room 2 and meet our guest.

819
00:45:43,474 --> 00:45:46,034
Beam?

820
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:47,407
We have a technology

821
00:45:47,478 --> 00:45:50,379
which can take you instantly
from your ship to ours.

822
00:45:50,447 --> 00:45:52,176
lt's quite harmless.

823
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:53,511
May we?

824
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:01,049
Energize.

825
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:14,567
Astonishing!

826
00:46:14,638 --> 00:46:15,570
You Federations

827
00:46:15,639 --> 00:46:18,267
are obviously
an advanced culture.

828
00:46:18,342 --> 00:46:21,038
The Federation is made up
of many cultures.

829
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:23,079
l am Vulcan.

830
00:46:23,147 --> 00:46:24,739
Neelix.

831
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:28,615
Good to meet you.

832
00:46:28,685 --> 00:46:31,449
lnteresting.

833
00:46:31,522 --> 00:46:35,356
What... what exactly...

834
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:40,157
What exactly does all this...

835
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:41,697
all this do?

836
00:46:41,765 --> 00:46:43,596
l assure you
that everything in this room

837
00:46:43,667 --> 00:46:45,862
has a specific function.

838
00:46:45,936 --> 00:46:49,463
However, it would take
several hours to explain it all.

839
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:52,202
l suggest we proceed
to your quarters.

840
00:46:52,276 --> 00:46:53,971
Oh.

841
00:46:55,078 --> 00:46:57,137
Perhaps you would care
for a bath.

842
00:46:57,214 --> 00:46:58,909
A what?

843
00:46:58,982 --> 00:47:00,882
Hmm...

844
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:19,534
lt's okay.
lt's okay.

845
00:47:19,603 --> 00:47:20,627
Who are you?

846
00:47:20,704 --> 00:47:23,537
My name is Kim-- Harry Kim.

847
00:47:23,607 --> 00:47:25,131
l'm an Ensign
on the Starship Voyager.

848
00:47:25,209 --> 00:47:27,871
l was kidnapped from the Array
just like you were.

849
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:29,103
l don't know where we are.

850
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:31,010
What was Starfleet doing
at that Array?

851
00:47:31,081 --> 00:47:33,311
We were looking for you,
actually.

852
00:47:33,383 --> 00:47:35,351
One minute, we're, we're
in the Badlands, the next...

853
00:47:35,419 --> 00:47:37,546
You mean, you were
trying to capture us.

854
00:47:37,621 --> 00:47:40,055
Yeah... consider
yourself captured.

855
00:47:40,123 --> 00:47:41,784
Oh, l know l have
a phaser here somewhere.

856
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:44,828
l don't find this
at all amusing, Starfleet.

857
00:47:47,731 --> 00:47:49,289
There's no point.

858
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:51,391
lt's locked.

859
00:47:52,903 --> 00:47:53,927
Hey!

860
00:47:54,004 --> 00:47:55,733
Hey, hey, hey what's that
going to accomplish?

861
00:47:55,806 --> 00:47:57,034
What are they doing to us?!

862
00:47:57,107 --> 00:47:58,540
What are these things
growing on us?!

863
00:47:58,609 --> 00:48:00,543
Look, do you want them
to sedate you again?

864
00:48:04,081 --> 00:48:06,481
You're right, Starfleet.

865
00:48:12,422 --> 00:48:14,515
lt's the Klingon half of me.

866
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:17,719
lt's just, it's hard
to control it sometimes.

867
00:48:24,835 --> 00:48:26,393
What's your name, Maquis?

868
00:48:32,809 --> 00:48:34,572
B'Elanna.

869
00:48:34,645 --> 00:48:36,875
B'Elanna Torres.

870
00:48:38,949 --> 00:48:41,440
l hope you're feeling better.

871
00:48:41,518 --> 00:48:44,681
l know how frightening all this
must be for both of you.

872
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:48,350
l've brought some clothes
if you care to change.

873
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:50,416
Why are you holding us here?

874
00:48:50,494 --> 00:48:52,052
You are not prisoners.

875
00:48:52,129 --> 00:48:55,064
ln fact,
we consider you honored guests.

876
00:48:56,633 --> 00:48:59,363
The Caretaker
has sent you to us.

877
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:00,460
As long as you are not violent

878
00:49:00,570 --> 00:49:01,832
you are free
to leave your quarters.

879
00:49:01,905 --> 00:49:04,066
What's wrong with us?

880
00:49:04,141 --> 00:49:06,268
What are these things?

881
00:49:06,343 --> 00:49:08,811
We really don't know.

882
00:49:11,014 --> 00:49:12,572
You must be hungry.

883
00:49:12,649 --> 00:49:15,550
Would you care to join me
on the courtyard for a meal?

884
00:49:19,256 --> 00:49:21,622
Our food dispensers
are right this way.

885
00:49:25,495 --> 00:49:27,395
We're underground.

886
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:30,160
Our society is subterranean.

887
00:49:30,233 --> 00:49:34,169
We've lived here
for over 500 generations.

888
00:49:34,237 --> 00:49:36,364
But before that,
you lived on the surface?

889
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:38,203
Until the warming began.

890
00:49:38,275 --> 00:49:39,242
The warming?

891
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:41,402
When our surface
turned into a desert

892
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:44,003
and the Caretaker
came to protect us.

893
00:49:44,081 --> 00:49:47,050
Our ancient journals
tell us he opened

894
00:49:47,117 --> 00:49:48,744
a deep chasm in the ground

895
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:51,219
and led our ancestors
to this place.

896
00:49:51,288 --> 00:49:54,815
Since then, he has provided
for all our needs.

897
00:49:59,629 --> 00:50:01,859
Oh, please forgive them.

898
00:50:01,932 --> 00:50:03,832
They know you've come
from the Caretaker.

899
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:06,562
None of us has ever seen him.

900
00:50:06,636 --> 00:50:08,661
This way, please.

901
00:50:21,918 --> 00:50:24,352
Does the Caretaker
provide your meals, too?

902
00:50:24,421 --> 00:50:25,445
ln fact, he does.

903
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:26,784
He designed

904
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:29,655
and built this entire city
for us after the warming.

905
00:50:29,726 --> 00:50:32,524
The food processors dispense
nutritional supplements

906
00:50:32,596 --> 00:50:34,564
every 4.1 intervals.

907
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:39,000
lt may not offer
the exotic tastes

908
00:50:39,069 --> 00:50:41,196
some of our younger people
crave these days,

909
00:50:41,271 --> 00:50:42,795
but it meets our needs.

910
00:50:46,943 --> 00:50:49,434
ls this how the Caretaker
communicates with you?

911
00:50:49,513 --> 00:50:51,708
He never communicates directly.

912
00:50:51,782 --> 00:50:54,842
We try to interpret his wishes
as best we can.

913
00:50:54,918 --> 00:50:56,943
l'm curious to know
how you've interpreted

914
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:59,147
the Caretaker's reason
for sending us here.

915
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:01,190
We believe he must
have separated you

916
00:51:01,291 --> 00:51:03,725
from your own species
for their protection.

917
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:04,954
Their protection?

918
00:51:06,263 --> 00:51:07,457
From your illness.

919
00:51:08,765 --> 00:51:10,790
Perhaps he's trying
to prevent a plague.

920
00:51:10,867 --> 00:51:13,233
We weren't sick
until we met your Caretaker.

921
00:51:13,303 --> 00:51:16,329
From time to time,
he asks us to care for people

922
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:17,498
with this disease.

923
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:18,700
lt's the least we can do.

924
00:51:18,775 --> 00:51:21,642
There have been others--
like us?

925
00:51:21,711 --> 00:51:23,679
Yes.

926
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:25,578
Where are they?

927
00:51:27,884 --> 00:51:30,250
Your condition is serious.

928
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:32,982
We don't know exactly
how to treat it.

929
00:51:33,056 --> 00:51:36,219
l'm afraid the others
did not recover.

930
00:52:29,746 --> 00:52:30,713
Sir...

931
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:33,977
Ah, Mr. Vulcan.
Come in, come in.

932
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:35,745
Please, l can hardly see you.

933
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:39,482
l want to thank you
for your hospitality.

934
00:52:39,556 --> 00:52:42,548
l must admit,
l haven't had access

935
00:52:42,626 --> 00:52:45,094
to a food replor...
uh, replicator before.

936
00:52:46,229 --> 00:52:48,561
l'd never have guessed.

937
00:52:48,632 --> 00:52:50,156
And to immerse myself
in water...

938
00:52:50,233 --> 00:52:52,895
oh, do you know
what joy this is?

939
00:52:55,739 --> 00:52:58,435
No one around here
wastes water in this manner.

940
00:52:58,508 --> 00:52:59,998
A good sand scrub--

941
00:53:00,043 --> 00:53:01,601
that's the best
that we can hope for.

942
00:53:05,382 --> 00:53:07,612
l'm pleased
you're enjoying yourself,

943
00:53:07,684 --> 00:53:09,515
but we're in orbit
of the fifth planet.

944
00:53:09,586 --> 00:53:10,917
We need your assistance.

945
00:53:10,987 --> 00:53:14,013
Oh, uh, could you hand
me the, uh... towel?

946
00:53:20,096 --> 00:53:23,623
lf you will scan
the large southern continent,

947
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:25,691
you'll find a range
of extinct volcanoes.

948
00:53:25,769 --> 00:53:27,532
Follow the foothills north

949
00:53:27,604 --> 00:53:29,538
until you discover
a dry river bed.

950
00:53:29,606 --> 00:53:31,938
You'll find an encampment there.

951
00:53:32,008 --> 00:53:34,374
Do you believe our people
might be at this location?

952
00:53:34,444 --> 00:53:37,845
lt's not impossible...
maybe...

953
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:42,151
Perhaps not,
but we'll find them.

954
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:45,711
We'll need several containers
of water to bring for barter.

955
00:53:45,789 --> 00:53:51,659
Do these, uh, replicators
make clothing, as well?

956
00:53:51,728 --> 00:53:53,161
Yes.

957
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:55,926
Will it make me
a uniform like yours?

958
00:53:55,999 --> 00:53:57,296
No...

959
00:53:57,367 --> 00:53:59,164
it most certainly will not.

960
00:53:59,236 --> 00:54:00,328
Hmm.

961
00:54:27,631 --> 00:54:30,293
Why would anyone want
to live in a place like this?

962
00:54:30,367 --> 00:54:34,167
The rich cormaline deposits
are very much in demand.

963
00:54:34,237 --> 00:54:35,898
The Ocampa use it for barter?

964
00:54:35,972 --> 00:54:39,305
Not the Ocampa, the Kazon-Ogla.

965
00:54:39,376 --> 00:54:41,810
The Kazon-Ogla?
Who are the Kazon-Ogla?

966
00:54:41,878 --> 00:54:43,072
They are.

967
00:54:43,146 --> 00:54:45,671
Kazon sects control
this part of the Quadrant.

968
00:54:45,749 --> 00:54:48,309
Some have food, some have ore,
some have water.

969
00:54:48,385 --> 00:54:50,285
They all trade, and they all
kill each other for it.

970
00:54:50,353 --> 00:54:52,378
l thought you said the Ocampa
had our people.

971
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:54,719
My friends!
lt's good to see you again!

972
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:56,053
Whoo!

973
00:54:59,429 --> 00:55:02,956
l must speak with your maje,
the ever-wise Jabin.

974
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:08,199
Ah. Very amusing.

975
00:55:08,271 --> 00:55:09,795
Very amusing.

976
00:55:09,873 --> 00:55:11,670
l, uh...

977
00:55:11,741 --> 00:55:13,732
l enjoy a joke
as much as the next man.

978
00:55:15,445 --> 00:55:16,742
Jabin!

979
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:17,745
My old friend!

980
00:55:21,051 --> 00:55:22,916
Water... water, Jabin.

981
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:26,547
l have water... to replace
all that l borrowed.

982
00:55:26,623 --> 00:55:28,250
Show them, Mr. Paris.

983
00:55:28,325 --> 00:55:32,227
Their ship has technology that
makes water out of thin air!

984
00:55:41,371 --> 00:55:42,668
You have more?

985
00:55:42,739 --> 00:55:46,231
Janeway to Voyager.
Energize.

986
00:55:51,147 --> 00:55:52,273
Oh!

987
00:55:58,321 --> 00:56:01,313
There's more where that came
from if you can help us.

988
00:56:01,424 --> 00:56:03,517
How can we help someone
so powerful

989
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:05,289
they can create water
out of thin air?

990
00:56:05,362 --> 00:56:07,489
This man led us here

991
00:56:07,564 --> 00:56:10,727
suggesting we might find
a people called the Ocampa.

992
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,267
Do you know where they are?

993
00:56:12,435 --> 00:56:14,164
Ocampa?

994
00:56:15,772 --> 00:56:17,069
She is Ocampa.

995
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:20,541
Why would you be interested
in such worthless creatures?

996
00:56:20,610 --> 00:56:22,043
They live only nine years.

997
00:56:22,112 --> 00:56:24,239
They make poor servants.

998
00:56:24,314 --> 00:56:26,214
We caught her when she wandered
to the surface.

999
00:56:26,282 --> 00:56:27,249
To the surface?

1000
00:56:27,317 --> 00:56:29,285
You mean, they live underground?

1001
00:56:29,352 --> 00:56:30,478
The entity in space

1002
00:56:30,553 --> 00:56:32,748
that gives them food and power,
also gives them

1003
00:56:32,822 --> 00:56:35,188
sole access to the only
water on this world--

1004
00:56:35,258 --> 00:56:36,782
two miles below the surface.

1005
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:40,261
This same entity has abducted
two of our people.

1006
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:42,628
We believe they might be
with the Ocampa.

1007
00:56:42,699 --> 00:56:46,226
There's no way to get to them.
We tried.

1008
00:56:46,302 --> 00:56:47,701
The entity has established

1009
00:56:47,771 --> 00:56:49,102
some kind
of subterranean barrier

1010
00:56:49,172 --> 00:56:50,867
we cannot penetrate.

1011
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:52,305
But she got out.

1012
00:56:52,375 --> 00:56:55,708
Occasionally, some of them do
find their way to the surface--

1013
00:56:55,779 --> 00:56:57,371
we don't know how--

1014
00:56:57,447 --> 00:56:59,642
but the Ocampa seal
the tunnels afterwards.

1015
00:56:59,716 --> 00:57:02,981
Maybe she can help these
good people find a way down.

1016
00:57:04,287 --> 00:57:07,085
You'd be wasting your time.

1017
00:57:07,157 --> 00:57:08,215
l've used every method

1018
00:57:08,291 --> 00:57:10,122
of persuasion l know
to get her to help us.

1019
00:57:10,193 --> 00:57:11,956
She won't!

1020
00:57:12,028 --> 00:57:13,552
Then she's worthless to you.

1021
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:17,999
Let us trade you water
for this scrawny little thing.

1022
00:57:19,536 --> 00:57:23,267
l'd be more interested
in acquiring this technology

1023
00:57:23,339 --> 00:57:26,069
that allows you to create water
from thin air.

1024
00:57:26,142 --> 00:57:27,541
That would be difficult.

1025
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:30,511
lt's integrated
into our ship's systems.

1026
00:57:31,548 --> 00:57:32,640
Tell them to drop their weapons!

1027
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:36,418
Drop them, my friends,
or he dies in an instant.

1028
00:57:36,486 --> 00:57:40,684
Do it!
Do it!

1029
00:57:46,996 --> 00:57:48,156
Step aside.

1030
00:57:54,637 --> 00:57:55,501
Come on!

1031
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:59,801
l strongly suggest
you get us out of here.

1032
00:57:59,876 --> 00:58:01,070
Six to beam up.

1033
00:58:12,288 --> 00:58:16,088
My dearest, didn't l promise
l'd save you?

1034
00:58:31,674 --> 00:58:33,198
Look, l'm sure Captain Janeway

1035
00:58:33,276 --> 00:58:35,437
is doing everything
she can to find us.

1036
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:38,072
What makes you think
any of them are still alive?

1037
00:58:40,683 --> 00:58:42,651
Should l call for some help?

1038
00:58:42,719 --> 00:58:44,084
No.

1039
00:59:00,303 --> 00:59:01,930
Are you in pain?

1040
00:59:02,005 --> 00:59:03,529
Are you watching us?

1041
00:59:03,606 --> 00:59:05,301
l thought we weren't supposed
to be your prisoners.

1042
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:07,309
l wasn't watching you.

1043
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:08,776
l was coming
to give you something.

1044
00:59:08,845 --> 00:59:10,039
l don't know if it will help.

1045
00:59:10,113 --> 00:59:11,705
lt's a medicine.

1046
00:59:11,781 --> 00:59:13,180
There are people
who have broken

1047
00:59:13,249 --> 00:59:14,807
from tradition
and left the city.

1048
00:59:14,951 --> 00:59:17,249
Their colony
grows fruits and vegetables.

1049
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:19,788
They discovered quite by
accident that the moss

1050
00:59:19,856 --> 00:59:21,414
that grows on
certain fruit trees

1051
00:59:21,491 --> 00:59:22,583
has healing properties.

1052
00:59:22,659 --> 00:59:25,526
l'm sorry for what
has happened to you.

1053
00:59:25,595 --> 00:59:27,222
We appreciate this,

1054
00:59:27,297 --> 00:59:28,559
but the only way
we're going to survive

1055
00:59:28,631 --> 00:59:31,759
is if we can get to the surface
and find our own people.

1056
00:59:31,834 --> 00:59:35,167
The elders would say that's
against the Caretaker's wishes.

1057
00:59:35,238 --> 00:59:36,671
What do you say?

1058
00:59:37,874 --> 00:59:39,842
The Caretaker's
been behaving strangely

1059
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:41,376
for the past several months--

1060
00:59:41,444 --> 00:59:44,641
abducting people,
increasing the power supply.

1061
00:59:44,714 --> 00:59:45,874
Power supply?

1062
00:59:45,949 --> 00:59:48,042
He's tripled the energy
he sends us.

1063
00:59:48,117 --> 00:59:49,914
They say we have
enough stored now

1064
00:59:49,986 --> 00:59:51,613
to run the city for five years.

1065
00:59:51,688 --> 00:59:53,485
And nobody knows why?

1066
00:59:53,556 --> 00:59:58,584
When we ask, we're told to trust
the Caretaker's decisions.

1067
00:59:58,661 --> 01:00:00,925
One person l knew
did get to the surface.

1068
01:00:01,030 --> 01:00:02,930
We never saw her again.

1069
01:00:02,999 --> 01:00:03,931
How?

1070
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:04,864
The ancient tunnels

1071
01:00:04,934 --> 01:00:06,925
that brought us here
still exist.

1072
01:00:07,003 --> 01:00:09,471
Over the years, small breaches
in security barriers

1073
01:00:09,539 --> 01:00:10,801
have appeared,
just large enough

1074
01:00:10,873 --> 01:00:13,273
for someone to get through,
but it still requires

1075
01:00:13,343 --> 01:00:15,402
digging through meters
of rock to get out.

1076
01:00:15,478 --> 01:00:17,946
Can you get us tools
to dig with?

1077
01:00:18,014 --> 01:00:21,711
lt would take days, maybe
even weeks to break through.

1078
01:00:21,784 --> 01:00:23,979
You have to rest.

1079
01:00:24,053 --> 01:00:25,315
Conserve your strength.

1080
01:00:25,388 --> 01:00:27,982
Please... it's our only chance.

1081
01:00:39,268 --> 01:00:41,429
lf you had told us
what you had planned,

1082
01:00:41,504 --> 01:00:43,995
we might have anticipated
your irrational behavior.

1083
01:00:44,073 --> 01:00:46,337
lrrational?
We got out of there, didn't we?

1084
01:00:46,409 --> 01:00:47,341
Excuse me.

1085
01:00:47,410 --> 01:00:48,707
Don't blame Neelix...

1086
01:00:48,778 --> 01:00:49,938
That's enough.

1087
01:00:50,013 --> 01:00:52,379
This is a Sick Bay,
not a conference room.

1088
01:00:52,448 --> 01:00:53,813
Visiting hours are over.

1089
01:00:53,883 --> 01:00:57,375
Everyone, except my patient,
is to leave immediately.

1090
01:00:57,453 --> 01:01:00,013
Computer, end medical
holographic program.

1091
01:01:01,457 --> 01:01:03,857
l never should have
gone to the surface.

1092
01:01:03,926 --> 01:01:05,917
l'm too curious.

1093
01:01:05,995 --> 01:01:07,929
l'm told it's my worst failing.

1094
01:01:07,997 --> 01:01:09,931
No, no.
lt's a wonderful quality--

1095
01:01:09,999 --> 01:01:11,489
your most endearing.

1096
01:01:12,635 --> 01:01:14,364
Would you be willing
to take us underground

1097
01:01:14,437 --> 01:01:15,597
to look for our missing crew?

1098
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:18,038
l'm afraid Jabin was right.

1099
01:01:18,107 --> 01:01:19,506
There's no way to get down.

1100
01:01:19,575 --> 01:01:21,338
The tunnel l came out
has been sealed.

1101
01:01:21,411 --> 01:01:22,742
We don't need a tunnel.

1102
01:01:22,812 --> 01:01:24,939
We have the ability
to transport there directly.

1103
01:01:25,081 --> 01:01:28,983
Captain, our sensors did not
pick up any indication

1104
01:01:29,052 --> 01:01:30,849
of an underground civilization.

1105
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:32,911
The subterranean barrier
Jabin described

1106
01:01:32,989 --> 01:01:34,081
may be responsible.

1107
01:01:34,157 --> 01:01:36,557
lt might also block
our transporter.

1108
01:01:36,626 --> 01:01:38,287
There are breaches

1109
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:41,524
in the security barrier
where it's begun to decay.

1110
01:01:41,597 --> 01:01:42,962
That's how l got out.

1111
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:46,425
Have the transporter room
begin a sweep

1112
01:01:46,502 --> 01:01:48,868
for any breaches we might
be able to beam through.

1113
01:01:48,938 --> 01:01:51,338
Kes can tell you where to go,

1114
01:01:51,407 --> 01:01:53,500
but, now that she's free,

1115
01:01:53,576 --> 01:01:55,271
we're leaving
this system together.

1116
01:01:55,344 --> 01:01:57,938
Neelix, these people rescued me.

1117
01:01:58,014 --> 01:01:59,777
l rescued you.

1118
01:01:59,849 --> 01:02:01,316
With their help.

1119
01:02:01,417 --> 01:02:04,648
lt would be wrong
not to help them now.

1120
01:02:21,437 --> 01:02:22,870
Captain, the pulses
from the Array

1121
01:02:22,939 --> 01:02:23,906
continue to accelerate.

1122
01:02:23,973 --> 01:02:25,531
The intervals between them
have decreased

1123
01:02:25,608 --> 01:02:27,098
another .8 seconds.

1124
01:02:38,688 --> 01:02:40,087
Kes.

1125
01:02:40,156 --> 01:02:41,088
Hello, Daggin.

1126
01:02:41,157 --> 01:02:42,715
We thought we'd never
see you again.

1127
01:02:42,792 --> 01:02:44,384
How did you get back?

1128
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:46,985
These people rescued me
from the Kazon.

1129
01:02:47,063 --> 01:02:49,623
l'm trying to help them
find two of their crewmen.

1130
01:02:49,699 --> 01:02:52,634
Does anyone know where
the aliens are kept-- the ones

1131
01:02:52,702 --> 01:02:54,260
the Caretaker sends here?

1132
01:02:54,337 --> 01:02:55,599
l think they're
at the Central Clinic.

1133
01:02:55,671 --> 01:02:57,195
Can you take us there?

1134
01:02:57,273 --> 01:02:59,537
No, she cannot.

1135
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:01,338
They can't speak
telepathically, Toscat.

1136
01:03:01,444 --> 01:03:04,106
Please talk aloud.

1137
01:03:04,147 --> 01:03:06,581
l didn't mean to be rude,

1138
01:03:06,649 --> 01:03:08,241
but you should not be here.

1139
01:03:08,317 --> 01:03:11,150
We'll be glad to leave
once we find our crewmen.

1140
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:12,244
That won't be possible.

1141
01:03:12,321 --> 01:03:14,414
We cannot interfere
with the Caretaker's wishes.

1142
01:03:14,490 --> 01:03:16,685
Maybe you can't, but we can.

1143
01:03:16,759 --> 01:03:18,021
You don't understand.

1144
01:03:18,094 --> 01:03:19,152
That's right.

1145
01:03:19,228 --> 01:03:20,661
They don't understand.

1146
01:03:20,730 --> 01:03:21,924
They have no way of knowing

1147
01:03:22,031 --> 01:03:23,692
that the Ocampa
have been dependent

1148
01:03:23,766 --> 01:03:25,097
on the Caretaker for so long

1149
01:03:25,168 --> 01:03:27,728
that we can't even think
for ourselves anymore.

1150
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:30,170
They don't understand
we were once a people

1151
01:03:30,239 --> 01:03:33,140
who had full command
of our minds' abilities.

1152
01:03:33,209 --> 01:03:36,110
The stories of our ancestors'
cognitive abilities

1153
01:03:36,179 --> 01:03:37,203
are apocryphal--

1154
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:39,646
at the very least exaggerated.

1155
01:03:39,715 --> 01:03:42,650
We lost those abilities
because we stopped using them.

1156
01:03:42,718 --> 01:03:45,186
We should not dwell
on what's been lost,

1157
01:03:45,254 --> 01:03:46,846
but on all that's been gained.

1158
01:03:46,923 --> 01:03:48,982
We've gained a talent
for dependence,

1159
01:03:49,091 --> 01:03:51,184
for simply taking
what we're given.

1160
01:03:51,260 --> 01:03:53,524
l'm going to help them, Toscat,
whether you like it or not,

1161
01:03:53,596 --> 01:03:56,258
and l think my friends
will join me.

1162
01:04:00,937 --> 01:04:03,497
You defied the Caretaker
by going to the surface, Kes.

1163
01:04:03,573 --> 01:04:06,599
Learn from the experience.

1164
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:08,610
Follow the path
he has set for us.

1165
01:04:08,678 --> 01:04:10,839
l've learned very well, Toscat.

1166
01:04:10,913 --> 01:04:13,074
l saw the sunlight.

1167
01:04:13,149 --> 01:04:14,878
l can't believe
that our Caretaker

1168
01:04:14,951 --> 01:04:17,010
would forbid us
to open our eyes

1169
01:04:17,086 --> 01:04:18,883
and see the sky.

1170
01:04:18,955 --> 01:04:21,355
Come with me--
we'll find your people.

1171
01:04:42,812 --> 01:04:43,904
Come on.

1172
01:04:59,228 --> 01:05:01,856
Don't let it beat you,
Starfleet. Come on.

1173
01:05:01,964 --> 01:05:02,931
l'm sorry.

1174
01:05:08,371 --> 01:05:10,032
All right.

1175
01:05:12,041 --> 01:05:14,839
lt's all right.
We'll rest a minute.

1176
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:17,846
Maybe l'd do better if l had
a little Klingon blood in me.

1177
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:22,112
Trust me-- it's more trouble
than it's worth.

1178
01:05:22,184 --> 01:05:25,051
You know, l spent my whole life
getting ready for Starfleet,

1179
01:05:25,121 --> 01:05:28,921
and on my very first mission,

1180
01:05:28,991 --> 01:05:31,789
l'm going to die.

1181
01:05:31,861 --> 01:05:34,421
We're not finished yet.

1182
01:05:36,098 --> 01:05:39,124
l know a few things
that old Sneezy didn't teach

1183
01:05:39,201 --> 01:05:40,190
in his survival course.

1184
01:05:40,269 --> 01:05:41,201
Sneezy?

1185
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:43,363
Commander Zakarian.

1186
01:05:43,439 --> 01:05:44,371
Remember?

1187
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:47,671
He must have been
allergic to everything.

1188
01:05:47,743 --> 01:05:49,108
You went to the Academy.

1189
01:05:49,178 --> 01:05:52,636
l actually made it into the
second year before we, uh...

1190
01:05:52,715 --> 01:05:55,741
we mutually agreed
that it wasn't the place for me.

1191
01:05:55,818 --> 01:05:56,785
You know

1192
01:05:56,852 --> 01:05:59,252
l never really liked Zakarian.

1193
01:06:00,923 --> 01:06:02,857
Shh. Listen.

1194
01:06:03,025 --> 01:06:05,289
They're getting faster.

1195
01:06:19,909 --> 01:06:21,171
Away team to Voyager.

1196
01:06:21,243 --> 01:06:22,175
Voyager here.

1197
01:06:22,244 --> 01:06:23,836
What's going on with the Array?

1198
01:06:23,913 --> 01:06:26,381
lt's no longer
sending out pulses, Captain,

1199
01:06:26,449 --> 01:06:28,974
and it appears to be
realigning its position.

1200
01:06:29,051 --> 01:06:31,042
Keep me informed.
Janeway out.

1201
01:06:35,491 --> 01:06:37,721
They haven't been
at the clinic for hours.

1202
01:06:37,793 --> 01:06:39,556
We can search the city.
Ask if anyone's seen them.

1203
01:06:39,628 --> 01:06:42,119
lf they were trying to get to
the surface, how would they go?

1204
01:06:42,198 --> 01:06:45,065
Probably the same way l did--
up one of the ancient tunnels.

1205
01:06:46,202 --> 01:06:47,863
Mr. Paris,
you and Neelix go with her

1206
01:06:47,937 --> 01:06:49,234
and start checking them out.

1207
01:06:50,573 --> 01:06:53,041
We need to talk to every doctor
and nurse at this hospital

1208
01:06:53,109 --> 01:06:54,974
see what they can tell us
about Torres and Kim.

1209
01:06:56,012 --> 01:06:57,138
Voyager to Janeway.

1210
01:06:57,213 --> 01:06:58,180
Go ahead.

1211
01:06:58,247 --> 01:06:59,271
Captain, the Array

1212
01:06:59,348 --> 01:07:01,543
is firing some kind of weapon
at the surface.

1213
01:07:01,650 --> 01:07:04,881
lt seems to be trying to seal
the energy conduits.

1214
01:07:04,954 --> 01:07:07,149
Understood.
Keep a channel open.

1215
01:07:08,324 --> 01:07:10,485
lf the Array is the Ocampa's
sole source of energy,

1216
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:12,424
why would the Caretaker
seal the conduits?

1217
01:07:12,495 --> 01:07:13,427
He would seal them

1218
01:07:13,496 --> 01:07:14,690
if he no longer
intended to use them

1219
01:07:14,764 --> 01:07:16,789
to protect the Ocampa
from their enemies.

1220
01:07:16,866 --> 01:07:18,231
Captain, there is
now enough evidence

1221
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:20,029
to form a reasonable
hypothesis.

1222
01:07:20,102 --> 01:07:21,967
l believe that
the Caretaker is dying.

1223
01:07:22,038 --> 01:07:23,096
Explain.

1224
01:07:23,172 --> 01:07:25,367
First, he increases
the energy supply

1225
01:07:25,441 --> 01:07:27,068
to provide the city
with a surplus

1226
01:07:27,143 --> 01:07:29,976
to last at least five years,
then he seals the conduits.

1227
01:07:30,046 --> 01:07:32,037
The logical conclusion is
that he does not intend

1228
01:07:32,114 --> 01:07:34,014
to continue his role
as Caretaker.

1229
01:07:34,083 --> 01:07:35,573
That doesn't necessarily
mean he's dying.

1230
01:07:35,651 --> 01:07:36,675
He could be leaving.

1231
01:07:36,752 --> 01:07:38,549
Doubtful.

1232
01:07:38,621 --> 01:07:41,021
Not after a millennium
of providing for these people.

1233
01:07:41,090 --> 01:07:44,253
l believe that the Caretaker
owes something to the Ocampa.

1234
01:07:44,326 --> 01:07:45,918
l believe the ''debt
that can never be repaid''

1235
01:07:45,995 --> 01:07:48,293
is very likely a debt to them.

1236
01:07:48,364 --> 01:07:50,559
ln addition, there were
his frequent references

1237
01:07:50,633 --> 01:07:52,191
to ''running out of time.''

1238
01:07:52,268 --> 01:07:54,736
l think he knew
his death was imminent.

1239
01:07:54,804 --> 01:07:58,934
lf he dies, how the hell
are we supposed to get home?

1240
01:08:06,749 --> 01:08:08,341
They're in this one.

1241
01:08:08,417 --> 01:08:10,282
Harry?!

1242
01:08:12,288 --> 01:08:13,380
Paris to Janeway.

1243
01:08:13,456 --> 01:08:14,445
Go ahead.

1244
01:08:14,523 --> 01:08:16,514
They're in one
of the tunnels, Captain.

1245
01:08:16,592 --> 01:08:19,060
l can't see them,
but they're up there.

1246
01:08:19,128 --> 01:08:20,595
We're going after them.

1247
01:08:20,663 --> 01:08:22,858
Call for transport
when you have them, Paris.

1248
01:08:22,932 --> 01:08:24,297
We'll meet you on the ship.

1249
01:08:24,366 --> 01:08:26,266
Janeway to Voyager.

1250
01:08:26,335 --> 01:08:27,267
Voyager here.

1251
01:08:27,336 --> 01:08:28,303
Three to beam up.

1252
01:08:28,370 --> 01:08:29,564
Stand by.

1253
01:08:31,340 --> 01:08:33,331
Captain,
l can't get a lock on you.

1254
01:08:33,409 --> 01:08:35,104
The weapons fire from the Array

1255
01:08:35,177 --> 01:08:36,872
has irradiated
the planet's crust.

1256
01:08:36,946 --> 01:08:39,073
The transport sensors
can't find the breaches

1257
01:08:39,148 --> 01:08:40,342
in the security barrier.

1258
01:08:41,484 --> 01:08:43,816
Come on, there's only one
other way out of here.

1259
01:08:45,855 --> 01:08:47,049
Janeway to Paris.

1260
01:08:47,123 --> 01:08:48,283
Go ahead.

1261
01:08:48,357 --> 01:08:50,348
The transporters aren't working.

1262
01:08:50,426 --> 01:08:52,656
You're going to have to find
a breach in the security barrier

1263
01:08:52,728 --> 01:08:54,025
when you get to the top.

1264
01:08:55,164 --> 01:08:56,631
Understood.

1265
01:08:56,699 --> 01:08:58,189
We're a few minutes behind you.

1266
01:08:58,267 --> 01:08:59,234
Janeway out.

1267
01:09:01,971 --> 01:09:03,632
l see them.

1268
01:09:15,885 --> 01:09:17,648
Took you long enough.

1269
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:20,518
How could l let down
the only friend l got?

1270
01:09:20,589 --> 01:09:23,023
Friend? What makes
you think l'm your friend?

1271
01:09:25,594 --> 01:09:27,118
Paris to Janeway.

1272
01:09:27,196 --> 01:09:28,128
Go ahead.

1273
01:09:28,197 --> 01:09:29,129
We found them, Captain.

1274
01:09:29,198 --> 01:09:30,256
Don't wait for us.

1275
01:09:30,332 --> 01:09:31,299
Get them to safety.

1276
01:09:36,438 --> 01:09:37,405
Don't worry.

1277
01:09:37,473 --> 01:09:39,566
l know where we can
get through the barrier.

1278
01:09:47,016 --> 01:09:49,314
Whatever you do, don't touch it.

1279
01:09:49,385 --> 01:09:52,354
We've been told
it'll burn your skin off.

1280
01:10:07,136 --> 01:10:08,535
They're not far ahead of us.

1281
01:10:08,604 --> 01:10:09,628
Keep going.

1282
01:10:27,122 --> 01:10:29,317
l think we've reached the top.

1283
01:10:29,391 --> 01:10:32,588
Neelix, get out your phaser.

1284
01:11:39,295 --> 01:11:42,230
Voyager, can you get
a lock on us now?

1285
01:11:42,298 --> 01:11:44,823
Affirmative, but l'm reading
only five signals.

1286
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:46,390
The others are...

1287
01:11:46,468 --> 01:11:47,867
Get down!

1288
01:11:59,348 --> 01:12:01,373
Paris to Janeway.

1289
01:12:01,483 --> 01:12:04,884
Chakotay, Tuvok, do you read?

1290
01:12:06,255 --> 01:12:07,654
Voyager, prepare to transport

1291
01:12:07,723 --> 01:12:09,020
everyone in this group
except me.

1292
01:12:09,091 --> 01:12:10,149
Aye, sir.

1293
01:12:10,225 --> 01:12:11,658
You're not thinking
of going back there.

1294
01:12:17,466 --> 01:12:18,455
Well...

1295
01:12:18,534 --> 01:12:20,263
the fool needs company.

1296
01:12:20,336 --> 01:12:21,701
Take care of them, dearest.

1297
01:12:21,770 --> 01:12:23,101
l'll see you later.

1298
01:12:23,172 --> 01:12:25,732
Voyager, make that
three to beam up.

1299
01:12:25,808 --> 01:12:29,244
Lock in on the other combadge
and energize.

1300
01:12:38,821 --> 01:12:40,311
My leg is broken.

1301
01:12:40,389 --> 01:12:42,289
l can't move.

1302
01:12:42,358 --> 01:12:43,757
-Hold on.
-Here they are!

1303
01:12:43,826 --> 01:12:45,589
Neelix, help me with Tuvok.

1304
01:12:48,564 --> 01:12:49,997
l'll get Chakotay.

1305
01:13:06,081 --> 01:13:07,048
Get out of here, Paris,

1306
01:13:07,116 --> 01:13:08,879
before the whole thing
comes down!

1307
01:13:09,017 --> 01:13:10,712
l intend to...

1308
01:13:10,786 --> 01:13:12,048
as soon as l get you up.

1309
01:13:12,121 --> 01:13:14,521
You get on those stairs,
they'll collapse.

1310
01:13:14,590 --> 01:13:16,387
We'll both die.

1311
01:13:16,458 --> 01:13:18,016
Yeah...

1312
01:13:18,093 --> 01:13:19,492
but on the other hand,

1313
01:13:19,561 --> 01:13:22,121
if l save your butt,
your life belongs to me.

1314
01:13:32,107 --> 01:13:34,302
lsn't that some kind
of lndian custom?

1315
01:13:35,944 --> 01:13:37,343
Wrong tribe.

1316
01:13:39,548 --> 01:13:41,516
l don't believe you.

1317
01:13:46,555 --> 01:13:49,490
You'd rather die than let me
be the one to rescue you.

1318
01:13:51,460 --> 01:13:53,758
Fine. Be a fool.

1319
01:13:53,829 --> 01:13:55,592
lf l have to die,

1320
01:13:55,664 --> 01:13:58,064
at least l'll have the pleasure
of watching you go with me.

1321
01:14:03,105 --> 01:14:04,970
lsn't there some lndian trick

1322
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:07,235
where you can turn
yourself into a bird

1323
01:14:07,309 --> 01:14:09,368
and fly us out of here?

1324
01:14:09,445 --> 01:14:11,242
You're too heavy.

1325
01:14:33,502 --> 01:14:35,265
Bridge to Janeway.

1326
01:14:35,337 --> 01:14:36,395
Go ahead.

1327
01:14:36,472 --> 01:14:38,736
Captain, two Kazon ships
are approaching the Array.

1328
01:14:38,807 --> 01:14:40,570
Set a course.
l'm on my way.

1329
01:14:40,642 --> 01:14:42,041
We've got to get back
to our ship.

1330
01:14:42,110 --> 01:14:45,375
l strongly advise you to rest.

1331
01:14:45,447 --> 01:14:47,574
l will not be held responsible
for the consequences.

1332
01:14:47,649 --> 01:14:49,981
ls the crew always
this difficult?

1333
01:14:50,052 --> 01:14:50,984
l don't know, Doc.

1334
01:14:51,053 --> 01:14:52,145
lt's my first mission.

1335
01:14:57,359 --> 01:14:59,190
Doesn't anyone know how
to turn off the program

1336
01:14:59,261 --> 01:15:00,159
when they leave?

1337
01:15:01,997 --> 01:15:03,862
Bring the weapons systems
on line.

1338
01:15:03,932 --> 01:15:06,958
Powering up phaser banks
and photon systems.

1339
01:15:08,170 --> 01:15:09,296
Red Alert.

1340
01:15:27,422 --> 01:15:29,083
The lead Kazon ship
is hailing us, Captain.

1341
01:15:29,157 --> 01:15:30,454
On screen.

1342
01:15:30,526 --> 01:15:32,221
Have you come to investigate

1343
01:15:32,294 --> 01:15:34,524
the Entity's strange behavior
too, Captain?

1344
01:15:34,596 --> 01:15:36,928
All we care about
is getting home, Jabin.

1345
01:15:36,999 --> 01:15:38,830
We're about to transport
over to the Array

1346
01:15:38,901 --> 01:15:40,129
to see if we can arrange it.

1347
01:15:40,202 --> 01:15:41,931
l'm afraid l cannot permit that.

1348
01:15:42,037 --> 01:15:44,301
We have no dispute with you.

1349
01:15:44,373 --> 01:15:46,136
l have a dispute with anyone
who would challenge us.

1350
01:15:46,208 --> 01:15:47,937
This is ridiculous.

1351
01:15:48,043 --> 01:15:49,874
We have no intention
of challenging you.

1352
01:15:49,945 --> 01:15:51,913
And l have no intention
of letting anyone

1353
01:15:51,980 --> 01:15:54,175
with your technological
knowledge board the Array.

1354
01:15:54,249 --> 01:15:57,741
Jabin, can we discuss this
like two civilized...?

1355
01:15:57,819 --> 01:15:59,810
They're powering up
their weapons.

1356
01:15:59,888 --> 01:16:01,185
l guess we can't.

1357
01:16:03,091 --> 01:16:05,355
Shields are holding.

1358
01:16:06,728 --> 01:16:09,959
Fire phasers.
Evasive pattern delta four.

1359
01:16:24,846 --> 01:16:26,438
Janeway to Chakotay.

1360
01:16:26,515 --> 01:16:28,244
Tuvok and l
are beaming to the Array.

1361
01:16:28,317 --> 01:16:30,046
Can you hold off the Kazon?

1362
01:16:30,118 --> 01:16:31,551
l think so, Captain.

1363
01:16:31,620 --> 01:16:32,882
Good.

1364
01:16:32,955 --> 01:16:36,152
Mr. Paris, take the conn.

1365
01:16:37,359 --> 01:16:39,020
Yes, ma'am.

1366
01:16:39,094 --> 01:16:40,493
Maintain transporter locks,
Ensign.

1367
01:16:40,562 --> 01:16:41,494
Emergency beam out status.

1368
01:16:41,563 --> 01:16:42,530
Aye, Captain.

1369
01:16:56,111 --> 01:16:59,012
The data processing system
is behind this wall, Captain.

1370
01:17:04,886 --> 01:17:06,217
You know what to do.

1371
01:17:26,174 --> 01:17:31,168
Well... you're, you're nothing
if not persistent.

1372
01:17:31,246 --> 01:17:34,215
We need you to send us back
where we came from.

1373
01:17:34,282 --> 01:17:37,376
Oh... that isn't possible.

1374
01:17:37,452 --> 01:17:41,912
l have... barely enough strength
to complete my work.

1375
01:17:44,326 --> 01:17:47,454
You're sealing the conduits
before you die.

1376
01:17:47,529 --> 01:17:52,125
lf l don't, the Kazon
will steal the water.

1377
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:55,135
But, in a few years,

1378
01:17:55,203 --> 01:17:58,798
when the Ocampa's energy
runs out, it won't matter.

1379
01:17:58,874 --> 01:18:01,308
They'll be forced
to come to the surface

1380
01:18:01,410 --> 01:18:03,844
and they won't be able
to survive.

1381
01:18:03,879 --> 01:18:07,178
Something you did turned
their planet into a desert,

1382
01:18:07,249 --> 01:18:08,273
didn't it?

1383
01:18:08,350 --> 01:18:11,046
That was the debt
that could never be repaid.

1384
01:18:11,119 --> 01:18:16,682
Well, we're explorers
from another galaxy,

1385
01:18:16,758 --> 01:18:20,023
but we had no idea
that our technology

1386
01:18:20,095 --> 01:18:23,792
would be so destructive
to their atmosphere.

1387
01:18:23,865 --> 01:18:25,457
Two, two of us

1388
01:18:25,534 --> 01:18:29,163
were chosen to stay
behind and care for them.

1389
01:18:29,237 --> 01:18:30,898
There's another like you here?

1390
01:18:32,474 --> 01:18:34,533
Not anymore.

1391
01:18:34,609 --> 01:18:36,372
No, no. She...

1392
01:18:36,445 --> 01:18:39,471
she went off to look
for more interesting places.

1393
01:18:39,548 --> 01:18:41,345
Why were you bringing
ships here--

1394
01:18:41,416 --> 01:18:43,714
infecting people
with a fatal illness?

1395
01:18:43,785 --> 01:18:44,752
Oh, they...

1396
01:18:44,820 --> 01:18:47,880
they didn't die of an illness.

1397
01:18:48,023 --> 01:18:54,121
They died
because they were incompatible.

1398
01:18:55,263 --> 01:18:57,026
''lncompatible''?

1399
01:18:57,099 --> 01:18:59,727
l've been searching the galaxy

1400
01:18:59,801 --> 01:19:04,204
for a compatible
biomolecular pattern.

1401
01:19:04,306 --> 01:19:06,103
Now, in some individuals,

1402
01:19:06,141 --> 01:19:09,804
l found cellular structures
that were similar, but l...

1403
01:19:09,878 --> 01:19:11,778
You've been trying to procreate?

1404
01:19:11,847 --> 01:19:14,975
l needed someone to replace me--

1405
01:19:15,050 --> 01:19:16,677
someone who'd understand

1406
01:19:16,752 --> 01:19:22,384
the enormous responsibility
of... caring for the Ocampa.

1407
01:19:22,457 --> 01:19:25,722
Only my offspring could do that.

1408
01:19:32,634 --> 01:19:35,364
Did you ever consider
allowing the Ocampa

1409
01:19:35,437 --> 01:19:37,200
to care for themselves?

1410
01:19:39,007 --> 01:19:40,702
They're children.

1411
01:19:40,776 --> 01:19:42,676
Children have to grow up.

1412
01:19:42,744 --> 01:19:45,406
We're explorers, too.

1413
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:46,879
Most of the species
we've encountered

1414
01:19:46,948 --> 01:19:48,711
have overcome all kinds
of adversity

1415
01:19:48,784 --> 01:19:50,274
without a Caretaker.

1416
01:19:50,352 --> 01:19:52,718
lt's the challenge
of surviving on their own

1417
01:19:52,788 --> 01:19:54,653
that helps them to evolve.

1418
01:19:54,723 --> 01:20:00,559
Maybe your... children
will do better than you think.

1419
01:20:01,730 --> 01:20:03,527
Voyager to Janeway.

1420
01:20:03,598 --> 01:20:04,565
Go ahead.

1421
01:20:04,633 --> 01:20:05,861
We've got problems here.

1422
01:20:16,244 --> 01:20:17,609
Kazon just got some backup.

1423
01:20:17,679 --> 01:20:19,271
We need more time.

1424
01:20:19,347 --> 01:20:21,542
Can you hold them off
for another few minutes?

1425
01:20:21,616 --> 01:20:23,413
We'll do our best.
Kim out.

1426
01:20:24,653 --> 01:20:26,746
Their weapons array
has been hit.

1427
01:20:27,789 --> 01:20:28,915
They're in trouble.

1428
01:20:28,990 --> 01:20:32,824
Neither of us has enough
firepower to stop that ship.

1429
01:20:32,894 --> 01:20:34,259
l'm setting a collision course,

1430
01:20:34,329 --> 01:20:36,524
but the guidance
system is disabled.

1431
01:20:36,598 --> 01:20:38,759
l'll have to pilot
the ship manually.

1432
01:20:38,834 --> 01:20:40,802
Get the crew ready
to beam to Voyager

1433
01:20:40,869 --> 01:20:42,564
and drop shields for transport.

1434
01:20:44,472 --> 01:20:46,372
Paris, my crew is coming over.

1435
01:20:46,441 --> 01:20:49,501
Tell one of your crackerjack
Starfleet transporter chiefs

1436
01:20:49,578 --> 01:20:50,875
to keep a lock on me.

1437
01:20:50,946 --> 01:20:53,176
l'm going to try and take
some heat off your tail.

1438
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:54,715
Acknowledged.

1439
01:20:54,783 --> 01:20:57,547
But don't think for a second
this makes us even, Chakotay.

1440
01:20:57,619 --> 01:20:59,519
Your life is still mine.

1441
01:20:59,588 --> 01:21:01,317
Paris out.

1442
01:21:07,596 --> 01:21:09,188
l'm holding a lock on him, sir,

1443
01:21:09,264 --> 01:21:10,925
but he's getting too close.

1444
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,627
l'm getting you out
of there, Chakotay.

1445
01:21:13,702 --> 01:21:14,691
Not yet!

1446
01:21:19,074 --> 01:21:20,336
You're breaking up!

1447
01:21:20,408 --> 01:21:21,568
Stand by to transport.

1448
01:21:21,643 --> 01:21:23,201
Wait!

1449
01:21:30,886 --> 01:21:32,012
Now!

1450
01:21:40,295 --> 01:21:42,456
Transporter Room 2,
do you have him?

1451
01:21:42,530 --> 01:21:43,895
They've got me.

1452
01:21:53,508 --> 01:21:56,102
Captain, l can access the system

1453
01:21:56,177 --> 01:21:57,804
to send us back
to Federation space,

1454
01:21:57,879 --> 01:22:00,074
but it will take
several hours to activate.

1455
01:22:01,349 --> 01:22:03,044
Unless you help us.

1456
01:22:03,118 --> 01:22:05,177
Oh, l wish l could,

1457
01:22:05,253 --> 01:22:08,017
but l have
very little time left.

1458
01:22:08,089 --> 01:22:11,923
So l have initiated
a self-destruct program.

1459
01:22:11,993 --> 01:22:15,053
lf you destroy the Array,
we'll have no way to get home.

1460
01:22:15,130 --> 01:22:17,064
The Ocampa's enemies
cannot be allowed

1461
01:22:17,132 --> 01:22:20,033
to, to control
this installation.

1462
01:22:20,101 --> 01:22:23,593
ln minutes,
it will be destroyed.

1463
01:22:23,672 --> 01:22:25,503
You have to go.

1464
01:22:25,573 --> 01:22:27,404
Go now!

1465
01:22:51,766 --> 01:22:54,257
The Caretaker.

1466
01:22:57,772 --> 01:22:59,501
Voyager, report.

1467
01:22:59,574 --> 01:23:00,438
A Kazon vessel

1468
01:23:00,542 --> 01:23:02,874
just collided
with the Array, Captain.

1469
01:23:02,911 --> 01:23:04,708
Are you all right?

1470
01:23:04,779 --> 01:23:05,871
Affirmative.

1471
01:23:05,947 --> 01:23:07,539
Stand by.

1472
01:23:07,615 --> 01:23:10,675
The self-destruct program
has been damaged.

1473
01:23:10,752 --> 01:23:14,210
Now, this installation
will not be destroyed.

1474
01:23:14,289 --> 01:23:15,517
But it must be.

1475
01:23:15,590 --> 01:23:20,357
The Kazon must not be allowed
to gain control of it.

1476
01:23:20,428 --> 01:23:23,556
They will annihilate the Ocampa.

1477
01:23:47,155 --> 01:23:49,555
Shall l activate
the program to get us back?

1478
01:23:49,624 --> 01:23:53,185
And what happens to the Ocampa
after we're gone?

1479
01:23:56,865 --> 01:24:01,859
Captain, any action we take
to protect the Ocampa

1480
01:24:01,970 --> 01:24:04,996
would affect the balance
of power in this system.

1481
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:08,874
The Prime Directive
would seem to apply.

1482
01:24:08,977 --> 01:24:10,467
Would it?

1483
01:24:13,415 --> 01:24:15,975
We never asked to be involved,
Tuvok...

1484
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:20,579
but we are.

1485
01:24:22,323 --> 01:24:24,120
We are.

1486
01:24:30,732 --> 01:24:33,565
Mr. Tuvok, ready
the tricobalt devices.

1487
01:24:33,635 --> 01:24:34,260
Aye, Captain.

1488
01:24:34,335 --> 01:24:35,734
Open a channel to the Kazon.

1489
01:24:35,804 --> 01:24:36,930
Channel open.

1490
01:24:37,005 --> 01:24:38,472
Be advised, Captain.

1491
01:24:38,540 --> 01:24:40,440
l have called
for additional ships.

1492
01:24:40,508 --> 01:24:43,944
l'm calling to warn you to move
your vessels to a safe distance.

1493
01:24:44,012 --> 01:24:46,310
l intend to destroy the Array.

1494
01:24:46,381 --> 01:24:47,814
You can't do that.

1495
01:24:47,882 --> 01:24:49,850
l can and l will.

1496
01:24:49,918 --> 01:24:51,579
End transmission.

1497
01:24:52,454 --> 01:24:54,752
They're increasing fire,
Captain.

1498
01:24:54,823 --> 01:24:55,949
Shields are holding.

1499
01:24:56,024 --> 01:24:58,322
Move us 400 kilometers
from the Array, Mr. Paris.

1500
01:24:58,393 --> 01:24:59,985
Yes, ma'am.

1501
01:25:00,028 --> 01:25:01,188
What do you think you're doing?

1502
01:25:01,229 --> 01:25:03,561
That Array is the only way
we have to get back home.

1503
01:25:03,631 --> 01:25:05,565
l'm aware everyone has
families and loved ones

1504
01:25:05,633 --> 01:25:07,123
at homes they want
to get back to--

1505
01:25:07,202 --> 01:25:10,171
so do l-- but l'm not
willing to trade the lives

1506
01:25:10,238 --> 01:25:12,297
of the Ocampa
for our convenience.

1507
01:25:12,373 --> 01:25:13,863
We'll have to find
another way home.

1508
01:25:13,975 --> 01:25:15,636
What other way home is there?

1509
01:25:15,710 --> 01:25:18,804
Who is she to be making
these decisions for all of us?

1510
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:20,575
She's the Captain.

1511
01:25:22,050 --> 01:25:24,484
The tricobalt devices are ready.

1512
01:25:24,552 --> 01:25:26,611
We're in position.

1513
01:25:32,060 --> 01:25:33,755
Fire.

1514
01:25:57,919 --> 01:26:00,786
The lead Kazon ship
is hailing us.

1515
01:26:00,889 --> 01:26:02,789
On screen.

1516
01:26:04,459 --> 01:26:06,689
You have made an enemy today.

1517
01:26:09,330 --> 01:26:11,525
They are withdrawing, Captain.

1518
01:26:21,543 --> 01:26:22,874
Come in.

1519
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:27,511
You asked to see me, Captain?

1520
01:26:27,582 --> 01:26:29,675
Mr. Paris...

1521
01:26:29,751 --> 01:26:31,719
you have a problem.

1522
01:26:31,786 --> 01:26:34,050
l've invited Chakotay

1523
01:26:34,122 --> 01:26:36,613
and the other Maquis
to become part of this crew.

1524
01:26:36,791 --> 01:26:38,349
lt seemed the only
reasonable thing to do

1525
01:26:38,426 --> 01:26:39,893
under the circumstances.

1526
01:26:40,028 --> 01:26:42,519
Will you provide
a bodyguard for me, Captain?

1527
01:26:42,597 --> 01:26:44,326
lt seems you already have one.

1528
01:26:44,399 --> 01:26:46,196
l do?

1529
01:26:46,267 --> 01:26:49,896
Mr. Chakotay said something
about his life belonging to you.

1530
01:26:49,971 --> 01:26:52,940
He'll be taking responsibility
for your safety.

1531
01:26:53,007 --> 01:26:56,374
l think l'm going to enjoy this.

1532
01:26:56,444 --> 01:26:58,412
Don't be so sure.

1533
01:26:58,479 --> 01:27:00,470
He'll also be my First Officer.

1534
01:27:00,582 --> 01:27:03,312
Everyone aboard this ship
will report to him--

1535
01:27:03,351 --> 01:27:07,219
including the Lieutenant
assigned to conn.

1536
01:27:08,856 --> 01:27:10,153
Me?

1537
01:27:10,225 --> 01:27:13,490
l've entered into the Ship's Log
on this date

1538
01:27:13,561 --> 01:27:16,587
that l'm granting
a field commission of Lieutenant

1539
01:27:16,664 --> 01:27:18,632
to Thomas Eugene Paris.

1540
01:27:23,738 --> 01:27:24,830
Congratulations.

1541
01:27:27,942 --> 01:27:30,240
Um, for the first time
in my life,

1542
01:27:30,311 --> 01:27:32,108
l don't know what to say.

1543
01:27:32,180 --> 01:27:34,546
You've earned this, Tom.

1544
01:27:34,616 --> 01:27:37,141
l'm only sorry
your father won't know.

1545
01:27:37,218 --> 01:27:38,685
Oh, he'll know...

1546
01:27:41,055 --> 01:27:42,613
when we get back.

1547
01:27:42,690 --> 01:27:46,217
Ah, Captain, we were
just coming to see you.

1548
01:27:46,294 --> 01:27:48,262
We've supplied your ship
with water, Neelix.

1549
01:27:48,329 --> 01:27:49,557
lt's ready to go.

1550
01:27:49,631 --> 01:27:52,930
Well, you see that's what
we wanted to discuss.

1551
01:27:53,034 --> 01:27:55,195
We'd like to go with you.

1552
01:27:56,271 --> 01:27:58,671
l'm sorry.
This isn't a passenger ship.

1553
01:27:58,740 --> 01:27:59,707
Of course not.

1554
01:27:59,774 --> 01:28:00,706
We won't be passengers.

1555
01:28:00,808 --> 01:28:03,003
We'd be valuable colleagues.

1556
01:28:03,044 --> 01:28:04,204
''Colleagues''?

1557
01:28:04,279 --> 01:28:07,510
Whatever you need is
what l have to offer.

1558
01:28:07,582 --> 01:28:10,073
You need a guide,
l'm your guide.

1559
01:28:10,151 --> 01:28:13,052
You need supplies, l know
where to procure them.

1560
01:28:13,121 --> 01:28:16,750
l have friends among races
you don't even know exist.

1561
01:28:16,824 --> 01:28:17,756
You need a cook?

1562
01:28:17,825 --> 01:28:19,019
Oh, you haven't lived

1563
01:28:19,093 --> 01:28:21,220
until you've tasted
my angla'bosque.

1564
01:28:21,296 --> 01:28:24,424
lt will be my job
to anticipate your needs

1565
01:28:24,499 --> 01:28:25,966
before you know you have them.

1566
01:28:26,034 --> 01:28:28,332
And l anticipate your first need

1567
01:28:28,403 --> 01:28:30,064
will be me.

1568
01:28:30,138 --> 01:28:32,231
Captain, we both want

1569
01:28:32,307 --> 01:28:34,468
very much to be a part
of your journey.

1570
01:28:49,957 --> 01:28:55,259
We're alone in
an uncharted part of the galaxy.

1571
01:28:55,330 --> 01:28:58,891
We've already made
some friends here

1572
01:28:58,966 --> 01:29:00,934
and some enemies.

1573
01:29:01,035 --> 01:29:05,404
We have no idea of the dangers
we're going to face,

1574
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:08,000
but one thing is clear:

1575
01:29:08,076 --> 01:29:11,011
Both crews are going
to have to work together

1576
01:29:11,079 --> 01:29:13,570
if we're to survive.

1577
01:29:13,648 --> 01:29:16,674
That's why Commander Chakotay
and l have agreed

1578
01:29:16,751 --> 01:29:18,343
that this should be one crew--

1579
01:29:20,054 --> 01:29:21,646
a Starfleet crew.

1580
01:29:21,723 --> 01:29:25,853
And as the only Starfleet vessel
assigned to the Delta Quadrant

1581
01:29:25,960 --> 01:29:28,224
we'll continue
to follow our directive

1582
01:29:28,296 --> 01:29:31,527
to seek out new worlds
and explore space.

1583
01:29:34,435 --> 01:29:37,404
But our primary goal is clear.

1584
01:29:37,472 --> 01:29:39,337
Even at maximum speeds

1585
01:29:39,407 --> 01:29:42,968
it would take 7 5 years
to reach the Federation,

1586
01:29:43,044 --> 01:29:46,445
but l'm not willing
to settle for that.

1587
01:29:46,514 --> 01:29:49,540
There's another entity
like the Caretaker

1588
01:29:49,617 --> 01:29:50,811
out there somewhere

1589
01:29:50,885 --> 01:29:53,649
who has the ability
to get us there a lot faster.

1590
01:29:53,721 --> 01:29:55,552
We'll be looking for her

1591
01:29:55,623 --> 01:29:59,024
and we'll be looking
for wormholes, spatial rifts

1592
01:29:59,093 --> 01:30:01,493
or new technologies to help us.

1593
01:30:03,498 --> 01:30:07,901
Somewhere, along this journey,

1594
01:30:07,969 --> 01:30:10,870
we'll find a way back.

1595
01:30:11,939 --> 01:30:15,602
Mr. Paris, set a course...

1596
01:30:15,676 --> 01:30:18,042
for home.

1597
01:30:18,112 --> 01:30:19,101
Aye, Captain.
