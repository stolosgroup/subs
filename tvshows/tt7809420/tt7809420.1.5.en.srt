1
00:00:07,807 --> 00:00:10,387
Fuck!

2
00:00:10,429 --> 00:00:13,119
- If I were to renounce you...
- Why? If I'm the one you love.

3
00:00:13,151 --> 00:00:14,975
It's the only way to run away.

4
00:00:15,043 --> 00:00:18,215
Give them the water they want.
I don't want riots in town.

5
00:00:18,241 --> 00:00:20,626
- I don't want to marry you.
- Whore!

6
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:21,990
I know you lost your friends,

7
00:00:22,014 --> 00:00:24,302
but you're the only one that
knows his way through the mines.

8
00:00:24,326 --> 00:00:26,208
Today we are rich,
my little brother.

9
00:00:26,232 --> 00:00:28,038
Behave properly
with their family,

10
00:00:28,068 --> 00:00:30,380
and everything will be all
right, including your candidacy.

11
00:00:30,404 --> 00:00:32,239
Tear that Goddamn sheriff apart.

12
00:00:32,603 --> 00:00:35,154
- Agh!
- Are you my new mom?

13
00:00:35,178 --> 00:00:36,590
Shh!

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,074
Who are the real-world Illuminati ?
Find out @ saveanilluminati.com

15
00:00:52,598 --> 00:00:53,754
Nathan?

16
00:00:55,571 --> 00:00:56,722
Nate?

17
00:01:01,698 --> 00:01:03,611
- Hey.
- Hi.

18
00:01:03,873 --> 00:01:07,294
- Where's your dad?
- Mom locked him in the living room.

19
00:01:08,605 --> 00:01:11,340
- Your mom?
- Yeah, my new mom.

20
00:01:11,561 --> 00:01:13,540
She came to visit last night.

21
00:01:23,916 --> 00:01:25,090
Nathan?

22
00:01:42,325 --> 00:01:43,619
Hey, honey.

23
00:01:43,929 --> 00:01:45,627
He's still asleep and

24
00:01:45,901 --> 00:01:47,653
we don't wanna disturb
him, all right?

25
00:01:50,824 --> 00:01:52,165
So, Mary

26
00:01:54,053 --> 00:01:55,483
what's your mom look like?

27
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,877
What do you want?

28
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:32,957
I've just gotta speak
to Steve a minute.

29
00:03:32,981 --> 00:03:34,235
It's out of the question.

30
00:03:34,611 --> 00:03:36,504
- Please.
- You're not welcome here.

31
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:37,890
What's going on?

32
00:03:37,991 --> 00:03:39,387
Oh, Steve, thank God.

33
00:03:39,425 --> 00:03:41,175
- What happened?
- Nathan.

34
00:03:41,309 --> 00:03:42,849
He smashed Symone's face in.

35
00:03:43,263 --> 00:03:45,351
The sheriff's men found
him with his throat slit.

36
00:03:46,262 --> 00:03:48,117
And Eve didn't come
home last night.

37
00:03:48,255 --> 00:03:50,209
We haven't been able
to find her anywhere.

38
00:03:51,077 --> 00:03:52,421
I need your horse.

39
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:54,175
Steve, where are you going?

40
00:03:57,803 --> 00:03:58,924
- Steve!
- Hey!

41
00:04:00,192 --> 00:04:01,274
Steve!

42
00:04:50,292 --> 00:04:52,180
Remember the first time
you brought me here?

43
00:04:54,311 --> 00:04:56,299
Back when the water still ran?

44
00:04:58,491 --> 00:05:00,379
That was the happiest
day of my life.

45
00:05:05,123 --> 00:05:06,753
And then everything changed.

46
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,035
Eve.

47
00:05:08,898 --> 00:05:09,980
Look at me.

48
00:05:14,695 --> 00:05:15,710
Did you kill him?

49
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,877
Did you kill him?

50
00:05:28,481 --> 00:05:30,331
What are you doing here?

51
00:05:34,145 --> 00:05:35,542
I'm gonna take you away.

52
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:38,217
I'm gonna take you away.

53
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:42,179
And I'll hide you until
McCoy gets back, okay?

54
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:45,345
We're gonna hide you
until McCoy gets back.

55
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:49,396
And you'll stay with me?

56
00:05:56,618 --> 00:05:57,906
Will you stay with me?

57
00:06:10,173 --> 00:06:12,166
- Then why are you even here?
- To help you.

58
00:06:12,704 --> 00:06:14,049
I'm here to help you.

59
00:06:14,225 --> 00:06:15,793
You made your choice.

60
00:06:16,885 --> 00:06:18,105
You made it.

61
00:06:21,513 --> 00:06:22,905
Go back to your wife

62
00:06:23,873 --> 00:06:26,467
and your farm and
your fucking gold.

63
00:06:26,863 --> 00:06:28,092
If you don't leave
now, they will

64
00:06:28,116 --> 00:06:30,071
they will kill you
for what you've done.

65
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:34,396
Do you understand that?

66
00:06:35,445 --> 00:06:36,537
That's what's gonna happen.

67
00:06:36,561 --> 00:06:38,377
Do you understand that?
They will fucking kill you

68
00:06:38,401 --> 00:06:39,440
for what you've done.

69
00:06:41,304 --> 00:06:43,153
Thanks for leading us here.

70
00:06:45,428 --> 00:06:47,015
- Get out of my way, Steve.
- No, no, no.

71
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,039
- Move out the fucking way. Move!
- No, no, no, no.

72
00:06:50,237 --> 00:06:52,163
You can't fucking touch
her, you know that.

73
00:06:52,187 --> 00:06:54,507
- Stay where you are, Steve.
- You can't fucking touch her.

74
00:06:56,906 --> 00:07:00,548
You can't fucking touch her.
You can't... you can't...

75
00:07:24,588 --> 00:07:25,947
We should get going.

76
00:07:27,378 --> 00:07:28,746
Give me half an hour.

77
00:07:31,712 --> 00:07:33,671
You said that half an hour ago.

78
00:07:34,896 --> 00:07:37,165
Well, a lot seems to have
changed since I was here last.

79
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:40,947
There was a river down there

80
00:07:41,676 --> 00:07:43,502
that led directly to the mine.

81
00:07:45,013 --> 00:07:46,067
Well,

82
00:07:47,105 --> 00:07:48,769
there used to be gold.

83
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:51,258
There used to be water.

84
00:07:52,664 --> 00:07:54,485
There used to be a
whole lot of things.

85
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:58,289
Then we went mad.

86
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,419
That one went mad
all on his own.

87
00:08:09,202 --> 00:08:11,571
You look like a piece
of shit, you know that?

88
00:08:12,362 --> 00:08:13,745
It's the roots.

89
00:08:15,003 --> 00:08:16,533
You should've let me eat 'em.

90
00:08:16,914 --> 00:08:18,368
Oh, the roots.

91
00:08:18,545 --> 00:08:19,599
Of course.

92
00:08:20,647 --> 00:08:23,636
Tell you what, I could do with
some roots right now. Come on.

93
00:08:24,277 --> 00:08:26,890
No, you'd be crying like a baby.

94
00:08:27,615 --> 00:08:28,826
Come on,

95
00:08:29,107 --> 00:08:31,300
bring those pretty
little heads of yours.

96
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:32,406
Let's go.

97
00:08:39,642 --> 00:08:42,297
but, you get bored
every now and then.

98
00:08:42,645 --> 00:08:44,176
Right, and he would take

99
00:08:44,619 --> 00:08:46,606
he'd collect all the cow
shit in there, right?

100
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:48,046
And the he would
mix it with whiskey

101
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,177
and just sniff it to get high.

102
00:08:50,205 --> 00:08:52,189
It was like some weird fuck...

103
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:58,555
Shit.

104
00:09:00,294 --> 00:09:01,343
There it is.

105
00:09:04,188 --> 00:09:06,677
Christ, I swore I'd never
set foot in here again.

106
00:09:09,796 --> 00:09:11,526
You wanna go home, don't you?

107
00:09:14,543 --> 00:09:15,692
Come on.

108
00:09:15,807 --> 00:09:18,333
No one knows these mines
better than you, Kurt.

109
00:09:35,136 --> 00:09:37,267
Bronson, the guests
are arriving.

110
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,285
Give me some advice here.

111
00:09:49,347 --> 00:09:50,805
Solid authority?

112
00:09:51,768 --> 00:09:54,323
Or faith in the future?

113
00:09:56,785 --> 00:09:59,253
Faith in the future, every time.

114
00:09:59,753 --> 00:10:02,857
- Yes.
- Come on, I like you when you smile.

115
00:10:04,574 --> 00:10:06,487
You deal with the first guest,

116
00:10:06,618 --> 00:10:08,769
and I'll join you in a second.

117
00:10:21,248 --> 00:10:22,464
No.

118
00:10:22,553 --> 00:10:24,168
The guests can wait.

119
00:10:25,765 --> 00:10:27,023
Come.

120
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:35,193
It's only been three days
since the last injection.

121
00:10:35,938 --> 00:10:37,356
We said

122
00:10:37,934 --> 00:10:40,401
we inject you once
every fortnight.

123
00:10:41,359 --> 00:10:42,885
That was three years ago.

124
00:10:43,421 --> 00:10:44,863
It's not enough anymore.

125
00:10:44,899 --> 00:10:48,195
Let's calm down. If needs be,
we can change the formula.

126
00:10:52,795 --> 00:10:54,063
Give me another one.

127
00:10:57,172 --> 00:10:58,583
You could have a hear attack.

128
00:10:59,674 --> 00:11:00,981
And in any case,

129
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,379
increasing the dose doesn't...

130
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:05,710
Fill that syringe and
do what I pay you for,

131
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:08,432
or I swear to God, I'll tear
it out of your fucking hand

132
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:09,834
and bury it in your head.

133
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:10,920
Do it.

134
00:11:15,801 --> 00:11:16,978
Yes, well,

135
00:11:17,207 --> 00:11:20,062
maybe... maybe,
maybe 10 CCs more.

136
00:11:39,876 --> 00:11:41,197
You hear them, Henry?

137
00:11:42,846 --> 00:11:43,957
They've come for me.

138
00:11:45,386 --> 00:11:47,002
Are you really gonna hang me?

139
00:11:48,637 --> 00:11:50,453
You brought it
upon yourself, Eve.

140
00:11:50,525 --> 00:11:52,327
You saw what he did to her face.

141
00:11:52,384 --> 00:11:53,967
And he deserved to die for it?

142
00:11:54,854 --> 00:11:56,451
You should've come to me.

143
00:11:57,023 --> 00:11:59,106
And I'd have punished
him, cousin or not.

144
00:12:00,593 --> 00:12:02,023
I'd have taken away his badge

145
00:12:02,085 --> 00:12:04,311
and compensated you
for loss of earnings.

146
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:06,033
Instead,

147
00:12:06,343 --> 00:12:09,818
you chose to take away
a young child's father.

148
00:12:12,087 --> 00:12:13,226
She's better off.

149
00:12:13,255 --> 00:12:14,599
No, she isn't.

150
00:12:15,139 --> 00:12:17,169
And that's why you deserve
what you're gonna get.

151
00:12:17,408 --> 00:12:18,781
This is my town.

152
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:20,345
- Was.
- Is.

153
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:24,320
Mine and McCoy's.

154
00:12:25,236 --> 00:12:26,690
We made the rules.

155
00:12:28,049 --> 00:12:30,290
- Yeah.
- Everything has a price.

156
00:12:31,128 --> 00:12:33,512
That way everything
stays in balance.

157
00:12:36,668 --> 00:12:37,826
So,

158
00:12:38,918 --> 00:12:40,071
what's yours?

159
00:12:42,812 --> 00:12:45,315
- Some things can't be reduced to that.
- Like what?

160
00:12:45,372 --> 00:12:47,336
- Like duty.
- Spare me.

161
00:12:48,137 --> 00:12:49,295
Duty to what?

162
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:50,783
- The badge?
- That's right.

163
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:53,207
And the man you
murdered, you fucking...

164
00:13:00,567 --> 00:13:03,931
Nathan and I built those
gallows together, you know that?

165
00:13:06,048 --> 00:13:07,683
Kind of fitting,
don't you think?

166
00:13:07,807 --> 00:13:09,313
Hmm. When you're done with me,

167
00:13:09,337 --> 00:13:11,383
I wouldn't bother
taking them down, Henry.

168
00:13:11,417 --> 00:13:12,523
Is that right?

169
00:13:14,868 --> 00:13:16,427
Because, when Mac finds out,

170
00:13:16,499 --> 00:13:18,654
it is you who'll be
the next to swing.

171
00:13:25,686 --> 00:13:26,773
Well?

172
00:13:26,825 --> 00:13:28,241
Got as far as the canyon.

173
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:29,861
The bridge has collapsed.

174
00:13:29,995 --> 00:13:31,831
And also the horses are
wandering about there.

175
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:33,148
Damn.

176
00:13:35,346 --> 00:13:36,423
Well

177
00:13:36,862 --> 00:13:39,284
either they were crossing
the bridge when it collapsed,

178
00:13:39,474 --> 00:13:41,094
in which case, they're dead.

179
00:13:42,759 --> 00:13:44,079
Or they went
through the mines...

180
00:13:46,028 --> 00:13:47,296
In which case,

181
00:13:47,882 --> 00:13:48,997
they're dead.

182
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:52,825
We shouldn't jump
to conclusions.

183
00:13:54,002 --> 00:13:56,199
You don't wanna do anything
you're gonna regret.

184
00:13:58,974 --> 00:14:00,304
Morning, folks.

185
00:14:05,023 --> 00:14:06,267
What happened here?

186
00:14:06,573 --> 00:14:07,922
The mines were flooded,

187
00:14:08,232 --> 00:14:09,962
when Thomson diverted the river.

188
00:14:10,658 --> 00:14:12,822
Killing everyone stuck inside.

189
00:14:14,285 --> 00:14:16,402
Let's hope we don't
end up like them.

190
00:15:08,495 --> 00:15:09,658
Give me...

191
00:15:13,587 --> 00:15:14,917
Give me a sign.

192
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:54,280
What are you doing?

193
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:56,507
What is this place?

194
00:15:56,624 --> 00:15:58,279
I'll explain everything
to you later.

195
00:15:58,321 --> 00:16:00,031
Are you going to her?

196
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,659
I can't just do
nothing, Michelle.

197
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,604
She killed a man.

198
00:16:09,638 --> 00:16:10,768
I'm sorry.

199
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:47,124
So, Frank, the Sheriff
who stole Bronson's money.

200
00:16:47,191 --> 00:16:48,974
What's his name again?

201
00:16:49,644 --> 00:16:51,022
McCoy.

202
00:16:51,094 --> 00:16:52,804
McCoy.

203
00:16:53,184 --> 00:16:54,785
And just to be clear,

204
00:16:54,827 --> 00:16:57,216
I'll lead you to Greenvale
and point that fella out

205
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,491
and that's it. I have no
intention of putting myself

206
00:16:59,525 --> 00:17:02,672
in his line of fire.
This man is fast.

207
00:17:04,455 --> 00:17:05,856
Where do you know him from?

208
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,678
Well, I do business
everywhere with anyone.

209
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,400
And I know every
single businessman

210
00:17:10,424 --> 00:17:13,335
and every single lawman
from Beaufort to the border.

211
00:17:13,885 --> 00:17:17,154
Yeah, and you seem to be
a good judge of character.

212
00:17:21,654 --> 00:17:23,684
Why do you suck on them?

213
00:17:28,264 --> 00:17:30,137
It generates spit,

214
00:17:30,801 --> 00:17:33,459
so you don't need to
drink as much water.

215
00:17:35,725 --> 00:17:37,452
Bullshit.

216
00:17:39,597 --> 00:17:43,989
Well, we can discuss it further
when you've finished your water.

217
00:17:48,059 --> 00:17:49,490
We've got company.

218
00:17:50,771 --> 00:17:52,288
State Rangers.

219
00:17:57,005 --> 00:17:58,600
Jesus.

220
00:17:59,306 --> 00:18:02,281
All right, all right now,
I'll take care of this now.

221
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,736
It's one thing
killing a sheriff,

222
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,182
but you do not fuck around
with these fellows, all right?

223
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:11,094
Oh.

224
00:18:26,909 --> 00:18:28,885
Good morning, gentlemen.

225
00:18:28,932 --> 00:18:31,367
For what it's worth in
this hell of a place.

226
00:18:31,572 --> 00:18:33,643
- Where are you headed?
- Ah, Greenvale.

227
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:36,165
See if we can do a
few business deals.

228
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,209
Greenvale ain't no place
to be doing business deals.

229
00:18:39,338 --> 00:18:40,896
Well, maybe we can make it one.

230
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,817
I can be pretty persuasive.

231
00:18:47,361 --> 00:18:48,781
Best in the country.

232
00:18:53,112 --> 00:18:55,320
We're investigating
a recent robbery

233
00:18:55,348 --> 00:18:57,777
of the Crimson
Federal Bank coach.

234
00:18:57,876 --> 00:19:00,073
You know anything about it?

235
00:19:09,196 --> 00:19:10,737
Why?

236
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,455
Why the fuck did you do
that? They were leaving.

237
00:19:13,983 --> 00:19:17,249
Christ, now we'll have the whole
goddamn army down our backs.

238
00:19:17,514 --> 00:19:19,802
- I see no witnesses.
- Oh.

239
00:19:20,321 --> 00:19:23,334
I'm a businessman, goddammit.

240
00:19:23,394 --> 00:19:25,743
I can't afford this bullshit.

241
00:19:25,901 --> 00:19:28,416
It was me that told Bronson
about that federal coach

242
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,691
and all I've gotten for it
since is agitation and strife.

243
00:19:31,805 --> 00:19:34,167
You're not a businessman, Frank.

244
00:19:34,445 --> 00:19:36,644
You're a former
jailbird degenerate

245
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,831
with clear food-related issues

246
00:19:38,898 --> 00:19:41,894
who thinks he's one just
because he managed to sell

247
00:19:42,099 --> 00:19:43,609
a couple of cans of beans.

248
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,875
- Well, that's all...
- You know what I think, Frank?

249
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,342
I think maybe, you
tipped off the sheriff

250
00:19:49,372 --> 00:19:52,652
as well as Bronson about
the Federal Bank money.

251
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,906
What do you say?

252
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,644
Do I just

253
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:03,357
blow your brains out now,

254
00:20:03,387 --> 00:20:05,622
so we don't have to
worry about it anymore?

255
00:20:05,939 --> 00:20:11,939
Or do you take us to
that sheriff right now?

256
00:20:14,314 --> 00:20:18,161
Let's go! I want that
money by sundown.

257
00:20:21,522 --> 00:20:23,773
Looks like our main
guest is arriving.

258
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:26,446
You have made every
preparation, haven't you?

259
00:20:27,217 --> 00:20:28,788
Of course.

260
00:20:30,178 --> 00:20:33,132
And try and look a little
pleased to see him.

261
00:20:37,314 --> 00:20:39,164
He is the richest among us,

262
00:20:39,188 --> 00:20:42,163
and he can destroy your run
for governor with one word.

263
00:20:43,545 --> 00:20:45,056
Welcome, Mr. Morrison.

264
00:20:45,132 --> 00:20:47,142
Mr. Bronson.

265
00:20:50,286 --> 00:20:54,113
Yeah, it's a prototype
from Germany.

266
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:57,052
I'm financing a kid in Detroit
who's gotten it into his head

267
00:20:57,076 --> 00:20:59,842
- to build them here as well.
- Very nice.

268
00:21:00,455 --> 00:21:02,049
You should try to tell him

269
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:04,699
to make 'em stink a little less.

270
00:21:07,985 --> 00:21:10,130
Let's get some of that
dust off your face.

271
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:12,388
I want to show you something.

272
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,210
This way.

273
00:21:29,071 --> 00:21:31,784
These goddamn tunnels
all look the same.

274
00:21:32,509 --> 00:21:34,521
You need to keep an
eye out for details.

275
00:21:34,896 --> 00:21:37,543
Cracks in the rock,
distinctive ridges.

276
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,454
So, Red, is that story
about the bullet true?

277
00:21:42,744 --> 00:21:44,158
What story?

278
00:21:44,641 --> 00:21:47,287
About you killing a man with
a bullet but without a gun.

279
00:21:47,921 --> 00:21:49,395
You tell me.

280
00:21:49,885 --> 00:21:51,667
Ah, come on, it's
bullshit, right?

281
00:21:51,697 --> 00:21:54,187
- I mean, how is it even possible, when...
- Hey, Kurt,

282
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,289
quit talking shit, will ya?

283
00:21:56,808 --> 00:21:58,796
Just passing the time, Mac.

284
00:21:59,394 --> 00:22:01,436
What would you
rather I talk about?

285
00:22:01,944 --> 00:22:04,100
All the men who died in
here when the river burst?

286
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:06,626
I'd rather you
didn't talk at all.

287
00:22:06,989 --> 00:22:09,888
- You know their bodies are all still here.
- Yes, I do.

288
00:22:10,017 --> 00:22:12,818
And unless you wanna end up with
them, I suggest you concentrate

289
00:22:12,857 --> 00:22:15,007
on finding us a way out of here.

290
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:18,962
It's yours if you let her go.

291
00:22:21,344 --> 00:22:22,857
There's more.

292
00:22:24,463 --> 00:22:26,276
Enough to turn your life around.

293
00:22:29,296 --> 00:22:30,737
Shit.

294
00:22:31,668 --> 00:22:33,812
You of all people.

295
00:22:36,199 --> 00:22:38,842
You know, I remember your
sermons after the priest left.

296
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:42,573
You said that this...

297
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:45,322
This had ruined everything.

298
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,596
That it was evil,

299
00:22:48,246 --> 00:22:51,723
and could only ever lead
to corruption and violence.

300
00:22:53,007 --> 00:22:55,417
That we should learn
to, what was it?

301
00:22:55,938 --> 00:22:57,475
Oh, yeah.

302
00:22:57,997 --> 00:22:59,892
We should learn to farm again.

303
00:23:00,776 --> 00:23:02,097
And you know what?

304
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:04,039
I agreed with you.

305
00:23:05,358 --> 00:23:07,067
I came to this town

306
00:23:07,484 --> 00:23:09,447
thinking that gold

307
00:23:10,456 --> 00:23:11,894
was the answer.

308
00:23:13,954 --> 00:23:15,538
But you

309
00:23:17,882 --> 00:23:19,634
you son of a bitch,

310
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:21,875
you persuaded me otherwise.

311
00:23:22,938 --> 00:23:26,352
And now you come here
and try to bribe me?

312
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:29,937
Christ...

313
00:23:30,237 --> 00:23:32,636
Just when I thought this shit
hole couldn't get any worse.

314
00:23:32,938 --> 00:23:34,141
So leave.

315
00:23:35,377 --> 00:23:36,408
Huh?

316
00:23:39,047 --> 00:23:40,047
Leave.

317
00:23:42,083 --> 00:23:43,417
Go somewhere new.

318
00:23:45,355 --> 00:23:47,573
I'll give you all the
gold you can carry.

319
00:23:50,342 --> 00:23:51,560
If I let her go?

320
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:53,242
That's right.

321
00:24:17,854 --> 00:24:19,829
I could give you a couple
of hour's head start.

322
00:24:24,179 --> 00:24:25,617
After that,

323
00:24:26,366 --> 00:24:28,138
every sheriff from
here to the state line

324
00:24:28,177 --> 00:24:29,501
is gonna know who you are.

325
00:24:31,482 --> 00:24:32,879
You'll be fugitives.

326
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:35,145
And I mean for the
rest of your lives.

327
00:24:38,983 --> 00:24:40,467
I don't care.

328
00:24:43,419 --> 00:24:44,463
All right.

329
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:02,888
Make it quick.

330
00:25:16,694 --> 00:25:19,082
- This is crazy.
- No, it isn't.

331
00:25:19,705 --> 00:25:21,735
It's what I've been denying,

332
00:25:21,932 --> 00:25:23,941
- and now I'm ready...
- Steve.

333
00:25:24,636 --> 00:25:27,143
You're not made for
that kind of life.

334
00:25:27,996 --> 00:25:29,688
We won't last.

335
00:25:29,929 --> 00:25:31,975
They'll track us
down and kill us.

336
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:37,403
And it'll be worth it for every
moment we have until then,

337
00:25:39,302 --> 00:25:41,561
'Cause I love you, Eve.

338
00:25:44,195 --> 00:25:45,645
Say it again.

339
00:25:48,261 --> 00:25:49,572
I love you.

340
00:25:50,853 --> 00:25:52,273
I love you.

341
00:26:17,973 --> 00:26:19,361
What are you doing?

342
00:26:22,346 --> 00:26:23,747
What's right.

343
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:28,564
What? What are
you talking about?

344
00:26:28,588 --> 00:26:30,739
- What are you doing?
- I can't be the reason you gave it all up.

345
00:26:30,763 --> 00:26:31,897
Gave what up?

346
00:26:33,487 --> 00:26:34,888
Gave what up?

347
00:26:35,203 --> 00:26:36,695
You have to stay.

348
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:42,875
You have to make this place
beautiful, just like you imagined.

349
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:48,457
What are you doing?

350
00:26:48,548 --> 00:26:49,979
What are you doing?

351
00:26:52,057 --> 00:26:54,450
Open the cell. Henry.

352
00:26:55,743 --> 00:26:57,682
Henry, open the cell.

353
00:26:57,797 --> 00:27:00,164
Open... open the fucking cell!

354
00:27:01,333 --> 00:27:02,871
It's her decision, Steve.

355
00:27:04,374 --> 00:27:05,781
Why are you doing this?

356
00:27:08,845 --> 00:27:10,637
Promise me that's
what you'll do.

357
00:27:13,178 --> 00:27:14,577
Promise me.

358
00:27:15,392 --> 00:27:18,071
You'll never stop fighting
for what you believe in.

359
00:27:20,525 --> 00:27:22,654
Sooner or later,

360
00:27:23,447 --> 00:27:25,229
it will rain.

361
00:27:29,179 --> 00:27:31,022
Everything is all right.

362
00:27:45,701 --> 00:27:47,754
We've been this way already.

363
00:27:47,778 --> 00:27:49,454
What are you talking about?

364
00:27:50,889 --> 00:27:52,687
You see this mark?

365
00:27:54,287 --> 00:27:56,719
I made it a goddamn hour ago.

366
00:28:04,149 --> 00:28:05,614
Kurt.

367
00:28:05,735 --> 00:28:07,388
Kurt, look at me.

368
00:28:10,205 --> 00:28:13,150
Tell me we're not lost.

369
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:19,793
- Son of a bitch.
- I'm sorry, Mac, but it wasn't me

370
00:28:19,817 --> 00:28:21,233
- who wanted to go this way it was you.
- I know.

371
00:28:21,257 --> 00:28:23,203
- I fucking told you...
- I know!

372
00:28:28,659 --> 00:28:30,109
Listen to me, Kurt.

373
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:33,794
You survived this place
once before, right?

374
00:28:33,942 --> 00:28:35,319
Am I correct?

375
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,621
So you can survive it again,

376
00:28:36,657 --> 00:28:38,414
you're gonna get us out of here.

377
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,565
We need to follow the air.

378
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:44,126
I'm not going in there.

379
00:28:45,499 --> 00:28:47,867
I'm not gonna die in
here, Sheriff, are you?

380
00:29:01,702 --> 00:29:03,603
I tried everything.

381
00:29:04,675 --> 00:29:06,329
But, uh

382
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:11,963
she wouldn't...

383
00:29:28,702 --> 00:29:30,436
This is your inheritance.

384
00:29:42,421 --> 00:29:44,415
You can do whatever
you want with it.

385
00:29:48,747 --> 00:29:49,943
When?

386
00:29:57,759 --> 00:29:58,985
Tonight.

387
00:30:04,484 --> 00:30:06,248
She asked only one thing.

388
00:30:10,043 --> 00:30:11,217
Don't come.

389
00:30:27,147 --> 00:30:29,018
Stealing his horses.

390
00:30:29,254 --> 00:30:32,902
Burning crosses and still he just
goes all like nothing's happened.

391
00:30:33,223 --> 00:30:35,526
It ain't working, Thompson.

392
00:30:36,252 --> 00:30:37,911
And now you want us to risk

393
00:30:37,948 --> 00:30:39,393
having our asses blown
to hell with this stuff?

394
00:30:39,417 --> 00:30:41,416
I mean, come on,
Thompson, this...

395
00:30:42,908 --> 00:30:44,987
- Jesus Chris.
- Relax.

396
00:30:45,186 --> 00:30:46,508
It needs a fuse.

397
00:30:47,028 --> 00:30:48,339
Yeah,

398
00:30:48,897 --> 00:30:51,276
well, what that farmer
needs is a bullet.

399
00:30:52,291 --> 00:30:54,079
I already told you,

400
00:30:54,152 --> 00:30:56,175
we need his signature first.

401
00:30:56,737 --> 00:30:58,532
Or don't you care if
your share of the mine

402
00:30:58,556 --> 00:31:00,066
is legitimate or not?

403
00:31:01,274 --> 00:31:03,183
Are we thinking yet?

404
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:06,470
I'm thinking.

405
00:31:08,276 --> 00:31:10,015
I'm thinking, when
are you gonna start

406
00:31:10,052 --> 00:31:12,402
paying us some of
what you owe us?

407
00:31:12,729 --> 00:31:14,057
That's right.

408
00:31:15,351 --> 00:31:17,163
'Cause I'm getting doubtful

409
00:31:17,839 --> 00:31:19,948
we're ever going
to find any gold.

410
00:31:23,937 --> 00:31:25,089
Well,

411
00:31:25,398 --> 00:31:26,890
how about this, then?

412
00:31:27,016 --> 00:31:30,327
You can be patient a
little bit longer or

413
00:31:31,417 --> 00:31:33,301
you can take the few
dollars I owe you

414
00:31:33,325 --> 00:31:36,943
and go off the same two losers
you were when I met you.

415
00:31:41,293 --> 00:31:42,640
Well, which is it?

416
00:31:48,423 --> 00:31:50,424
Did you do the thing I
told you to do in town?

417
00:31:51,466 --> 00:31:52,984
Nope.

418
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:55,424
There was too much going on.

419
00:31:56,367 --> 00:31:58,149
They were hanging that Eve.

420
00:31:59,538 --> 00:32:01,312
That bitch who runs
the whorehouse.

421
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:10,081
Where you going?

422
00:32:13,392 --> 00:32:15,784
Here we have some pieces of art

423
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:18,036
- from all over the world.
- Impressive.

424
00:32:19,433 --> 00:32:21,306
- Here we are.
- Oh,

425
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:24,929
I had some advertising
men from New York

426
00:32:24,953 --> 00:32:29,723
put it together along with
an illustrator at the Herald.

427
00:32:30,055 --> 00:32:32,313
Those votes are already ours,

428
00:32:32,337 --> 00:32:35,239
yet, you leave nothing
at all to chance.

429
00:32:35,378 --> 00:32:37,710
Attentive to every detail.

430
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:40,199
- Yes.
- Your house is the same.

431
00:32:40,271 --> 00:32:43,999
I must say, the hospitality
you've provided so far

432
00:32:44,023 --> 00:32:45,920
has been impeccable.

433
00:32:48,204 --> 00:32:50,325
- You're surprised?
- Well,

434
00:32:50,476 --> 00:32:53,859
considering the first time
I saw your face on a poster,

435
00:32:53,897 --> 00:32:57,719
it had a number with several
zeros printed below it,

436
00:32:57,977 --> 00:33:01,211
I'd say you've come a long way.

437
00:33:03,417 --> 00:33:05,949
You like reminding me
of my past, don't you?

438
00:33:06,034 --> 00:33:09,451
I'm teasing Mr. Bronson.

439
00:33:10,665 --> 00:33:12,194
You're forgetting that

440
00:33:12,352 --> 00:33:15,358
before your special
relationship with Helen,

441
00:33:15,434 --> 00:33:17,193
we were your sponsor.

442
00:33:17,699 --> 00:33:20,161
We had the bounties on
your head rescinded.

443
00:33:20,198 --> 00:33:24,081
We facilitated your involvement
in the Wolfcreek aqueduct.

444
00:33:24,118 --> 00:33:26,842
Yes, yes, yes. I know where
you're going with this.

445
00:33:27,616 --> 00:33:29,406
And I promise you that,

446
00:33:29,466 --> 00:33:31,593
my share of the
investment is coming.

447
00:33:31,617 --> 00:33:33,712
The investment
isn't the problem.

448
00:33:33,814 --> 00:33:36,709
The problem is that
in all these years,

449
00:33:37,247 --> 00:33:40,521
I've never once heard you say

450
00:33:40,777 --> 00:33:42,454
"thank you".

451
00:33:58,337 --> 00:34:00,253
Thank you.

452
00:34:02,858 --> 00:34:05,612
Mr. Morrison, thank you.

453
00:34:06,311 --> 00:34:10,116
You're welcome,
Governor Bronson.

454
00:34:50,264 --> 00:34:52,539
"Follow the air", he says.

455
00:34:52,615 --> 00:34:54,154
Where the fuck is it?

456
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:56,958
You'd better pray this
is the right way, Red.

457
00:35:00,766 --> 00:35:02,341
Whoa!

458
00:35:03,504 --> 00:35:05,203
My heads!

459
00:35:05,905 --> 00:35:09,463
- My heads, my heads!
- Get him his goddamn heads.

460
00:35:13,295 --> 00:35:15,525
Billy?

461
00:35:26,857 --> 00:35:28,691
Billy.

462
00:35:31,362 --> 00:35:33,655
Shh...

463
00:36:15,539 --> 00:36:18,466
Mum? Mum?

464
00:36:33,739 --> 00:36:35,604
Hey, wake up! Wake up!

465
00:36:35,634 --> 00:36:38,489
Come on, kid. You're not going
anywhere on me, you understand?

466
00:36:38,657 --> 00:36:40,494
You ain't going anywhere on me.

467
00:36:40,778 --> 00:36:43,146
You said you were gonna
get me out of here.

468
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,720
So that's what you're gonna do,
you're gonna get me out of here.

469
00:36:49,289 --> 00:36:50,473
That's right.

470
00:36:51,034 --> 00:36:53,474
- My heads...
- No, no, no, we've got your heads.

471
00:36:53,617 --> 00:36:54,832
We've got all your heads.

472
00:36:54,897 --> 00:36:56,354
Your heads are just fine.

473
00:37:01,143 --> 00:37:02,578
You did it, kid.

474
00:37:43,099 --> 00:37:45,057
Hey, Old Timer, it's okay.

475
00:37:46,701 --> 00:37:48,552
What's going on?

476
00:37:49,034 --> 00:37:50,790
Hanging.

477
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:54,357
Can you water and
feed our horses?

478
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,874
Keep the change.

479
00:37:56,033 --> 00:37:57,370
Good man.

480
00:38:03,539 --> 00:38:05,901
Derek, you take the high ground

481
00:38:05,939 --> 00:38:08,233
and shoot the
sheriff on my mark.

482
00:38:08,257 --> 00:38:11,955
Frank, you tell me
which one is McCoy.

483
00:38:12,484 --> 00:38:17,000
And, let's only use these if

484
00:38:18,352 --> 00:38:20,299
we have to.

485
00:39:52,961 --> 00:39:55,330
We have gathered here today

486
00:39:55,619 --> 00:39:58,023
to witness the sentencing

487
00:39:58,319 --> 00:40:02,163
of Eve Margaret Hoover.

488
00:40:27,321 --> 00:40:29,553
She has been found guilty

489
00:40:30,431 --> 00:40:33,835
of murder in the first degree.

490
00:40:36,849 --> 00:40:37,932
And so,

491
00:40:38,777 --> 00:40:40,236
Eve Margaret Hoover,

492
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:44,591
you have been sentenced to death

493
00:40:46,537 --> 00:40:47,974
for the willful murder

494
00:40:49,699 --> 00:40:51,420
of the public official

495
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:57,088
Nathan Jared Longinus.

496
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,337
Today,

497
00:41:02,177 --> 00:41:04,163
you will be executed of Eve.

498
00:41:05,998 --> 00:41:08,906
According to the
law of Greenvale,

499
00:41:09,585 --> 00:41:11,843
and the United
States of America,

500
00:41:13,361 --> 00:41:15,792
with the approval of
the Honorable Judge

501
00:41:16,871 --> 00:41:18,570
Albert Cowel.

502
00:41:27,927 --> 00:41:29,697
Executioner,

503
00:41:29,966 --> 00:41:31,703
prepare the prisoner.

504
00:41:41,588 --> 00:41:44,731
Is there a statement
you'd like to say?

505
00:42:25,963 --> 00:42:27,421
All right.

506
00:42:27,445 --> 00:42:29,865
By the powers vested in me,

507
00:42:29,956 --> 00:42:32,810
I do hereby order
the Executioner

508
00:42:32,857 --> 00:42:34,811
to fulfill his duty.

509
00:42:34,932 --> 00:42:36,737
Eve Margaret Hoover,

510
00:42:36,812 --> 00:42:39,538
may God have mercy on your soul.

511
00:43:11,913 --> 00:43:13,988
72 hours.

512
00:43:16,618 --> 00:43:18,551
Leave her there as a warning.

513
00:43:41,937 --> 00:43:43,176
Steve?

514
00:43:47,299 --> 00:43:48,953
What are you doing in here?

515
00:43:49,937 --> 00:43:51,024
The door was open.

516
00:43:51,055 --> 00:43:52,843
That doesn't mean you
could just walk in.

517
00:43:55,229 --> 00:43:56,497
You're right.

518
00:43:57,972 --> 00:43:59,422
I shouldn't be here.

519
00:44:01,481 --> 00:44:03,439
Steve should be here.

520
00:44:05,795 --> 00:44:08,701
But he's in town
weeping for his whore

521
00:44:09,764 --> 00:44:11,256
in front of everyone.

522
00:44:15,703 --> 00:44:18,398
You think I'd ever have
humiliated you like that?

523
00:44:25,693 --> 00:44:26,966
Please go.

524
00:44:48,679 --> 00:44:50,830
There's gold beneath
us, Michelle,

525
00:44:50,897 --> 00:44:52,491
whether you believe it or not.

526
00:44:54,177 --> 00:44:55,445
It could be ours.

527
00:47:00,497 --> 00:47:02,538
Come on, Red.

528
00:47:03,408 --> 00:47:05,160
One last push.

529
00:47:06,305 --> 00:48:06,671
