00:00:13,265 --> 00:00:16,225
WOMAN: Of course,
I've known the family for years.

3
00:00:16,265 --> 00:00:18,065
I've watched the children grow up.

4
00:00:19,664 --> 00:00:22,545
And I can honestly say
they've been the perfect neighbours.

5
00:00:22,585 --> 00:00:24,704
They've been no trouble at all.

6
00:00:29,464 --> 00:00:31,385
So, I can't believe...

7
00:00:32,664 --> 00:00:35,465
..anything like this could happen
right on our doorstep.

8
00:00:37,185 --> 00:00:40,424
Listen, they've had their ups
and downs. Who hasn't?

9
00:00:46,664 --> 00:00:48,424
But I never, ever dreamt...

10
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:51,104
..it would end like this.

11
00:01:02,784 --> 00:01:05,265
{\an8}WOMAN: Well, they moved down
from London, er...

12
00:01:05,305 --> 00:01:07,704
{\an8}..over 40 years ago now
to start a family.

13
00:01:07,745 --> 00:01:10,105
{\an8}Mum, Dad, three kids.

14
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:13,545
{\an8}Well, it's the perfect place
for kids to grow up, isn't it?

15
00:01:16,424 --> 00:01:18,584
{\an8}Vivien was pregnant
when they arrived and...

16
00:01:19,504 --> 00:01:21,025
{\an8}..even then,
she managed to look good.

17
00:01:23,545 --> 00:01:26,584
{\an8}And she worked, too. She had
a hairdressing salon in town.

18
00:01:29,745 --> 00:01:32,465
{\an8}Of course, she had to give all
of that up when Terry got ill.

19
00:01:35,344 --> 00:01:37,504
{\an8}And over the years, we've become...

20
00:01:37,545 --> 00:01:40,665
{\an8}well, not just neighbours,
but friends.

21
00:01:43,025 --> 00:01:44,864
Hi, Mary.
<font color="yellow">Hi.</font>

22
00:01:52,025 --> 00:01:54,504
MARY: So, Helen is the eldest child.

23
00:01:54,545 --> 00:01:56,665
And the cleverest.

24
00:01:56,704 --> 00:01:59,144
You always knew Helen would do well.

00:02:20,305 --> 00:02:22,465

<font color="yellow">'and hang it up straightaway</font>
<font color="yellow">so it doesn't get creased?'</font>

39
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:37,625
<font color="cyan">Yeah, straightaway.</font>

46
00:03:01,664 --> 00:03:03,985
MARY: Jake was born four years
after Helen.

47
00:03:04,025 --> 00:03:06,985
Oh, he...
He was a naughty little boy.

48
00:03:07,025 --> 00:03:09,705
But deep down,
he had such a good heart.

49
00:03:09,745 --> 00:03:11,104
You could forgive him anything.

50
00:03:12,145 --> 00:03:14,104
And he's turned into a lovely dad.

51
00:03:14,145 --> 00:03:16,705
<font color="yellow">One. Come on, push.</font>
<font color="yellow">Hold the butt.</font>

53
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:23,425
MARY: Natalie was the baby
of the family.

54
00:03:23,465 --> 00:03:25,425
First, she was going to be a dancer.

55
00:03:25,465 --> 00:03:27,104
And then an actress.

56
00:03:27,145 --> 00:03:28,905
And then an artist.

57
00:03:28,944 --> 00:03:31,064
But it all came to nothing.

58
00:03:31,104 --> 00:03:33,824
And she ended up
in just an ordinary office job.

<font color="yellow">Your wife.</font>

Mmm, these are good.
Did you make them?

<font color="cyan">I'm sorry we're late.</font>

83
00:04:46,384 --> 00:04:48,545

<font color="#008000">Chief of Eating Out?</font>

Oh, here we go...

94
00:05:09,264 --> 00:05:11,545
She is in charge of three hospitals.

95
00:05:11,584 --> 00:05:14,225
<font color="#008000">You're right, that is a big deal.</font>
<font color="#008000">Do you want to tell us about that?</font>

<font color="cyan">Well, I've been brought in</font>

<font color="cyan">which is failing so badly.</font>

98
00:05:18,345 --> 00:05:19,504
HE FEIGNS A YAWN

99
00:05:19,545 --> 00:05:21,024
<font color="cyan">OK, OK.</font>

100
00:05:21,064 --> 00:05:23,264
<font color="cyan">Thank you, very funny.</font>
<font color="yellow">Now, just stop it.</font>

101
00:05:23,305 --> 00:05:24,865
<font color="yellow">Because I want</font>
<font color="yellow">to tell you something.</font>

<font color="cyan">Wine, or are you still on the wagon?</font>
<font color="#008000">Er, no, still rolling along.</font>

103
00:05:27,464 --> 00:05:29,064
<font color="yellow">Stop it, please.</font>
Make it a large one.

00:05:29,105 --> 00:05:30,225
<font color="yellow">Shh!</font>

105
00:05:30,264 --> 00:05:31,904
<font color="yellow">Just stop it.</font>

106
00:05:31,944 --> 00:05:34,584
<font color="yellow">Now, there's something</font>
<font color="yellow">that I want to tell you all.</font>

<font color="cyan">A boyfriend?</font>

112
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:48,504
<font color="yellow">Well, yes.</font>

113
00:05:48,545 --> 00:05:51,545
<font color="#008000">What?</font>
Bloody hell, Mum, you dark horse!

114
00:05:51,584 --> 00:05:54,584
<font color="cyan">Hey, why didn't you tell us?</font>
<font color="yellow">Well, I'm telling you now.</font>

115
00:05:55,584 --> 00:05:58,185
<font color="yellow">I, you know,</font>
<font color="yellow">didn't want to say anything</font>

116
00:05:58,225 --> 00:06:00,225
<font color="yellow">until I was sure of my feelings.</font>

117
00:06:00,264 --> 00:06:02,944
So, you mean, you're in love?

118
00:06:02,985 --> 00:06:05,144
<font color="cyan">Nats, for God's sake.</font>
<font color="#008000">Shush, shush for the minute.</font>

00:06:05,185 --> 00:06:07,944

<font color="#008000">What's his name, this lover boy?</font>

120
00:06:07,985 --> 00:06:10,425
His name is Mark,
and he's a retired doctor.

121
00:06:10,464 --> 00:06:11,944
A surgeon, actually.

<font color="cyan">It's over 18 months.</font>

124
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:30,865
You expect her to sit around
mourning for the rest of her life?

125
00:06:30,904 --> 00:06:33,504
<font color="#008000">No, that's not what I'm saying.</font>
Dad wouldn't have minded.

126
00:06:33,545 --> 00:06:36,225
<font color="#008000">Well, he's not here to say, is he?</font>
No, we just want her to be happy.

127
00:06:36,264 --> 00:06:38,264
<font color="#008000">We only scattered his ashes</font>

00:06:38,305 --> 00:06:40,704

<font color="#008000">Why should I shut up?</font>

129
00:06:40,745 --> 00:06:42,665
<font color="cyan">Dad would be perfectly OK</font>
<font color="cyan">with Mum...</font>

00:06:46,944 --> 00:06:48,944
<font color="#008000">What's that supposed to mean?</font>

133
00:06:48,985 --> 00:06:50,665
<font color="yellow">Nothing, nothing.</font>
<font color="yellow">It's just that...</font>

134
00:06:50,704 --> 00:06:52,264
<font color="yellow">Look, this is not about your dad.</font>

135
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:55,504
<font color="yellow">It's about me.</font>
FRONT DOOR OPENS

137
00:06:57,865 --> 00:06:59,584
<font color="#008000">What?</font>
What?

138
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:01,185
<font color="yellow">It's Mark.</font>

139

<font color="cyan">What, he's coming tonight?</font>

00:07:04,425 --> 00:07:06,425
<font color="yellow">Up here!</font>
Oh, he's got a key!

141
00:07:06,464 --> 00:07:08,824
<font color="#008000">Mum, what the fuck is...?</font>
<font color="yellow">Mark!</font>

142
00:07:13,024 --> 00:07:14,865
Sorry I'm a bit early.

143
00:07:14,904 --> 00:07:16,824
SHE LAUGHS

144
00:07:23,305 --> 00:07:25,225
Would you...?
Would you like a biscuit?

145
00:07:25,264 --> 00:07:26,985
<font color="yellow">Er, no, thanks.</font>

146
00:07:32,064 --> 00:07:34,064
<font color="yellow">Did Mark's arrival in the family</font>

147
00:07:34,105 --> 00:07:37,185
<font color="yellow">cause any rows or upset</font>
<font color="yellow">amongst the siblings?</font>

148
00:07:37,225 --> 00:07:38,225
Well, they...

149
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,584
..they'd not long lost their dad.

150
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:43,785
And they'd plenty going on
in their own lives.

151
00:07:43,824 --> 00:07:46,024
So they were...
you know, they were rattled.

152
00:07:53,704 --> 00:07:55,904
HELEN: <font color="cyan">Do you think she meant</font>
<font color="cyan">Dad had affairs, then?</font>

153
00:07:55,944 --> 00:07:59,665
<font color="#008000">He was on a dating website for</font>
<font color="#008000">widows. I don't like it.</font>

154
00:07:59,704 --> 00:08:01,865
<font color="#008000">I just think he's got</font>
<font color="#008000">a really strange hold over her.</font>

155
00:08:01,904 --> 00:08:03,105
<font color="#008000">It's way too soon.</font>

156
00:08:03,144 --> 00:08:05,785
Is it? I mean, she's known him
for six months. It's not...

157
00:08:05,824 --> 00:08:08,105
<font color="#008000">Six months?</font>
<font color="#008000">Six months is not a long time.</font>

158
00:08:08,144 --> 00:08:09,824
<font color="#008000">How could she trust him</font>
<font color="#008000">after six months?</font>

159
00:08:09,865 --> 00:08:10,944
<font color="cyan">She knew Dad for 45 years.</font>

160
00:08:10,985 --> 00:08:12,665
<font color="cyan">Turns out she couldn't trust him,</font>
<font color="cyan">either.</font>

161
00:08:12,704 --> 00:08:14,665
<font color="#008000">That's not fair, is it?</font>
<font color="#008000">We don't know what Dad did,</font>

162
00:08:14,704 --> 00:08:16,704
<font color="#008000">and he's not even here</font>
<font color="#008000">to defend himself any more.</font>

163
00:08:16,745 --> 00:08:18,904
Are you saying Mum's lying?
<font color="#008000">No, I'm not saying that.</font>

164
00:08:18,944 --> 00:08:20,904
<font color="#008000">I'm just saying we don't know</font>
<font color="#008000">all the details, do we?</font>

165
00:08:20,944 --> 00:08:22,865
<font color="#008000">You know,</font>
<font color="#008000">I don't want to think about it.</font>

166
00:08:22,904 --> 00:08:25,745
<font color="#008000">But it could be something,</font>
<font color="#008000">you know, like a fling, sex, just...</font>

167
00:08:25,785 --> 00:08:27,545
<font color="cyan">Oh, and that makes it all OK (!)</font>

168
00:08:27,584 --> 00:08:30,225
<font color="#008000">No, but it makes it more forgivable</font>
<font color="#008000">cos men can do that sort of thing</font>

169
00:08:30,264 --> 00:08:32,144
<font color="#008000">all the time and there's no feelings</font>
<font color="#008000">involved.</font>

170
00:08:32,184 --> 00:08:34,024
<font color="#008000">It doesn't take away from</font>
<font color="#008000">the love of your wife.</font>

171
00:08:34,065 --> 00:08:36,904
<font color="cyan">There's always more to it</font>
<font color="cyan">than just the physical.</font>

172
00:08:36,945 --> 00:08:39,945
NATALIE: God, you're both
so cynical.

173
00:08:39,985 --> 00:08:42,705
Look, people do fall in love.
It does happen.

174
00:08:43,904 --> 00:08:45,585
I liked him.

175
00:08:52,065 --> 00:08:55,585
VIVIEN: I'm sorry about
the kids' behaviour last night.

176
00:08:56,664 --> 00:08:59,105
I really should have told them
about you before.

177
00:08:59,144 --> 00:09:01,264
<font color="yellow">My fault for being early.</font>

178
00:09:01,304 --> 00:09:02,825
<font color="yellow">They were fine.</font>

179
00:09:04,664 --> 00:09:06,585
No, they weren't.

180
00:09:08,024 --> 00:09:09,585
They were frosty.

181
00:09:10,865 --> 00:09:12,784
<font color="yellow">They were protective of you.</font>

182
00:09:13,865 --> 00:09:15,664
<font color="yellow">My daughter would be the same.</font>

183
00:09:19,504 --> 00:09:21,625
And all those questions.

184
00:09:21,664 --> 00:09:24,144
As if you were applying for a job.

185
00:09:25,304 --> 00:09:27,585
<font color="yellow">They'll get used to the idea.</font>

186
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:29,144
<font color="yellow">They're adults.</font>

187
00:09:29,184 --> 00:09:31,345
Well, they don't act like it
sometimes.

188
00:09:32,345 --> 00:09:34,504
Especially when
they're all together.

189
00:09:35,465 --> 00:09:37,144
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about it.</font>

190
00:09:43,424 --> 00:09:45,264
<font color="yellow">Are you not a bit hot in this?</font>

191
00:09:46,264 --> 00:09:47,985
A bit.

192
00:09:48,024 --> 00:09:49,825
SHE CHUCKLES

193
00:09:52,945 --> 00:09:55,424
I could do with a summer one,
really.

194
00:09:55,465 --> 00:09:57,184
SHE CHUCKLES

195
00:09:57,225 --> 00:09:59,784
MARY: I think the last ten years
of Vivien's marriage were...

196
00:10:01,945 --> 00:10:04,465
..not happy ones.
But she wasn't one to complain.

197
00:10:04,504 --> 00:10:05,825
I don't think the kids realised.

198
00:10:05,865 --> 00:10:07,345
They were so full
of their own lives.

199
00:10:08,544 --> 00:10:10,985
<font color="yellow">Which I gather were in some turmoil.</font>

200
00:10:12,144 --> 00:10:13,664
MARY: Well, I don't like to say.

201
00:10:13,705 --> 00:10:15,865
But I do know Jake and Leila were
having...

202
00:10:15,904 --> 00:10:18,024
yeah, a bit of a tough time.

203
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:20,825
<font color="#008000">Ah...</font>

204
00:10:20,865 --> 00:10:21,904
<font color="#008000">Right.</font>

205
00:10:21,945 --> 00:10:24,105
<font color="yellow">Mum, Dad's taking us to Disneyland!</font>

206
00:10:24,144 --> 00:10:25,904
<font color="cyan">We're going to Paris!</font>

207
00:10:26,865 --> 00:10:28,264
I'll be in in a sec.

208
00:10:30,745 --> 00:10:32,904
I hope you can deliver on that.

209
00:10:32,945 --> 00:10:35,184
<font color="#008000">Yeah, well, they deserve a holiday.</font>

210
00:10:35,225 --> 00:10:36,544
<font color="#008000">I'll get the money.</font>

211
00:10:36,585 --> 00:10:38,424
This is the rest of your stuff...

212
00:10:39,424 --> 00:10:40,664
..from the attic.

213
00:10:42,985 --> 00:10:45,144
I'll see you Monday.
<font color="#008000">Leila, please...</font>

214
00:10:45,184 --> 00:10:47,625
<font color="#008000">Can I just come inside</font>
<font color="#008000">and talk to you? Please, just...</font>

215
00:10:47,664 --> 00:10:48,745
<font color="#008000">Just a chat.</font>

216
00:10:48,784 --> 00:10:50,184
Not now.

217
00:11:02,465 --> 00:11:04,225
<font color="yellow">Put your size four boot</font>
<font color="yellow">up Connor's arse</font>

218
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:06,424
<font color="yellow">and get those corrected drawings</font>
<font color="yellow">ASAP, yeah?</font>

219
00:11:08,664 --> 00:11:10,664
So, anyway, before he arrived...

220
00:11:11,664 --> 00:11:13,345
..Mum said Dad was no angel.

221
00:11:14,904 --> 00:11:17,384
And that can only mean he had
affairs, can't it?

222
00:11:17,424 --> 00:11:19,225
There's never been any hint of this
before.

223
00:11:19,264 --> 00:11:22,105
I mean, he was away a lot
travelling for work, but...

224
00:11:23,585 --> 00:11:25,745
But it just casts Dad
in a completely new light.

225
00:11:26,904 --> 00:11:28,544
Are you listening to me at all?

226
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:32,345
<font color="yellow">We've all got secrets.</font>

227
00:11:32,384 --> 00:11:33,504
<font color="yellow">Look at us.</font>

228
00:11:34,865 --> 00:11:37,024
<font color="yellow">It doesn't make him any less</font>
<font color="yellow">of a father, does it?</font>

229
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:39,705
<font color="yellow">Everybody lies.</font>

230
00:11:39,745 --> 00:11:41,465
<font color="yellow">Even your mum, probably.</font>

231
00:11:43,304 --> 00:11:44,825
Do they?

232
00:11:48,585 --> 00:11:50,784
<font color="yellow">Were there any family feuds</font>

233
00:11:50,825 --> 00:11:53,384
<font color="yellow">that might have had a bearing</font>
<font color="yellow">on what happened last night?</font>

234
00:11:55,784 --> 00:11:58,544
MARY: Well, I mean,
all families row, don't they?

235
00:11:58,585 --> 00:12:00,705
But, no, nothing.

236
00:12:00,745 --> 00:12:04,585
I mean, not to the point
of such a terrible tragedy.

237
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:05,825
No.

238
00:12:26,925 --> 00:12:29,045
CAR PULLS UP

239
00:12:47,845 --> 00:12:49,205
<font color="yellow">Ah!</font>

240
00:12:49,244 --> 00:12:50,524
<font color="yellow">Exquisite.</font>

241
00:12:55,685 --> 00:12:57,404
Thanks for the cheese straws, Mary.

242
00:12:57,445 --> 00:12:59,165
Delicious.

243
00:12:59,205 --> 00:13:00,484
<font color="cyan">Oh, my pleasure.</font>

244
00:13:00,524 --> 00:13:03,404
<font color="cyan">How did it go, then?</font>
Oh, a few sticky moments.

245
00:13:03,445 --> 00:13:06,004
But they'll get used to it.
<font color="cyan">Of course they will.</font>

246
00:13:06,045 --> 00:13:08,484
<font color="cyan">Are you off on a trip?</font>
Yup, just a couple of days.

247
00:13:08,524 --> 00:13:10,845
Back Sunday night.
<font color="cyan">Oh, where to?</font>

248
00:13:10,884 --> 00:13:12,565
I don't know, actually.

249
00:13:12,604 --> 00:13:13,685
It's a surprise.

250
00:13:13,725 --> 00:13:15,045
<font color="cyan">Oh, well, that's...</font>

251
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:16,325
<font color="cyan">That's lovely, isn't it?</font>

252
00:13:16,364 --> 00:13:17,805
HE TOOTS THE HORN
Oh!

253
00:13:19,045 --> 00:13:20,124
I'd better go.

254
00:13:22,484 --> 00:13:24,004
<font color="cyan">I'll keep an eye on the house.</font>

255
00:13:25,124 --> 00:13:26,764
<font color="cyan">Have a great time.</font>

256
00:13:28,644 --> 00:13:32,524
MARY: 'But I worried, after Terry
died, that Viv would get very low.

257
00:13:32,565 --> 00:13:35,045
'So I suggested we go out
on a few outings to cheer her up.'

258
00:13:35,085 --> 00:13:38,124
SHE SIGHS
But, well...

259
00:13:38,165 --> 00:13:40,685
I should have known a woman
like Vivien wouldn't be single

260
00:13:40,725 --> 00:13:41,845
for five minutes.

261
00:13:41,884 --> 00:13:43,725
"Good for her," I thought.

262
00:13:52,124 --> 00:13:54,124
JAKE: <font color="#008000">19. One more.</font>
<font color="#008000">Keep it up.</font>

263
00:13:54,165 --> 00:13:55,325
<font color="#008000">20.</font>

264
00:13:55,364 --> 00:13:56,484
<font color="#008000">Very good.</font>

265
00:13:56,524 --> 00:13:57,805
<font color="#008000">Oh, a cheeky bonus.</font>

266
00:13:57,845 --> 00:13:59,364
THEY LAUGH

267
00:13:59,404 --> 00:14:00,725
<font color="#008000">Well done.</font>

268
00:14:01,965 --> 00:14:03,685
<font color="#008000">Very, very good, lady.</font>

269
00:14:04,925 --> 00:14:07,725
<font color="#008000">How do you feel about once more</font>
<font color="#008000">around the park before we head home?</font>

270
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:09,445
Oh, God...

271
00:14:09,484 --> 00:14:11,004
All right, then.
<font color="#008000">Yeah?</font>

272
00:14:11,045 --> 00:14:13,165
<font color="#008000">Go on, then, I'll catch you up.</font>

273
00:14:14,205 --> 00:14:15,845
Come on!
<font color="#008000">Coming!</font>

274
00:14:17,325 --> 00:14:20,205
<font color="cyan">Of course, I take this report</font>
<font color="cyan">very seriously.</font>

275
00:14:20,244 --> 00:14:22,925
<font color="cyan">And I want to apologise,</font>
<font color="cyan">on behalf of the Trust,</font>

276
00:14:22,965 --> 00:14:27,725
<font color="cyan">to any patient who has waited</font>
<font color="cyan">too long for treatment.</font>

277
00:14:27,764 --> 00:14:29,644
<font color="cyan">As you know,</font>

278
00:14:29,685 --> 00:14:33,124
<font color="cyan">there have been some significant</font>
<font color="cyan">resignations on the management team.</font>

279
00:14:33,165 --> 00:14:35,085
<font color="cyan">And my task now</font>

280
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:38,845
<font color="cyan">is to get this Trust back on track.</font>

281
00:14:41,325 --> 00:14:43,325
SHE SIGHS HEAVILY

282
00:14:45,805 --> 00:14:47,364
DOOR OPENS

283
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:51,124
Helen...

284
00:14:52,325 --> 00:14:54,565
"Significant resignations"?

285
00:14:54,604 --> 00:14:56,725
What about "brutal dismissals"?

286
00:14:56,764 --> 00:14:57,965
<font color="cyan">Oh, Meera, I...</font>

287
00:14:58,004 --> 00:15:00,165
<font color="cyan">I don't think you're supposed</font>
<font color="cyan">to be in this building.</font>

288
00:15:00,205 --> 00:15:03,524
I was pushed out of my job
because you needed a scapegoat.

289
00:15:03,565 --> 00:15:07,325
<font color="cyan">Come on, Meera, your department</font>
<font color="cyan">was consistently failing.</font>

290
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:09,524
After years of hard work,

291
00:15:09,565 --> 00:15:11,725
my professional reputation
is destroyed...

292
00:15:12,685 --> 00:15:13,725
..like that.

293
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:16,685
How do you sleep?

294
00:15:22,565 --> 00:15:23,805
DOOR CLOSES

295
00:15:25,845 --> 00:15:27,685
SHE MOANS

296
00:15:30,165 --> 00:15:32,085
THEY LAUGH

297
00:15:43,845 --> 00:15:46,925
Oh, did you book that trip
for your kids to Disneyland?

298
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:49,604
<font color="#008000">Yeah.</font>

299
00:15:50,604 --> 00:15:51,764
<font color="#008000">Yeah, I did.</font>

300
00:15:52,764 --> 00:15:54,205
<font color="#008000">Thank you for that.</font>

301
00:15:55,565 --> 00:15:57,244
You must miss living with them.

302
00:15:58,524 --> 00:15:59,805
<font color="#008000">Yeah.</font>

303
00:16:07,805 --> 00:16:09,764
<font color="#008000">Well...</font>

304
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:13,284
<font color="#008000">..I'd better be off.</font>

305
00:16:14,364 --> 00:16:16,124
Oh, it's in the drawer.

306
00:16:28,045 --> 00:16:30,244
<font color="#008000">Thanks, Stella.</font>
<font color="#008000">That's very generous.</font>

307
00:16:30,284 --> 00:16:31,565
My pleasure.

308
00:16:32,965 --> 00:16:34,685
Literally.
<font color="#008000">Ha!</font>

309
00:16:40,484 --> 00:16:42,085
HE CLOSES THE DRAWER

310
00:16:42,124 --> 00:16:44,085
HE SCRUNCHES THE MONEY

311
00:16:58,284 --> 00:16:59,564
What...?

312
00:16:59,605 --> 00:17:01,004
What's this?

313
00:17:01,044 --> 00:17:02,764
<font color="yellow">You don't have a fear of flying,</font>
<font color="yellow">do you?</font>

314
00:17:02,804 --> 00:17:04,125
Er, no.

315
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:07,405
No.
But where are we going?

316
00:17:07,445 --> 00:17:10,685
<font color="yellow">Oh, just a short-hop flight over the</font>
<font color="yellow">Channel to Le Touquet.</font>

317
00:17:11,685 --> 00:17:13,685
<font color="yellow">You told me you went there once</font>
<font color="yellow">as a teenager.</font>

318
00:17:14,725 --> 00:17:17,284
<font color="yellow">I thought you might like a revisit.</font>

319
00:17:21,004 --> 00:17:23,125
<font color="yellow">It's just a tiny plane.</font>

320
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:26,004
<font color="yellow">Half-an-hour trip.</font>

321
00:17:26,044 --> 00:17:27,324
<font color="yellow">Viv...</font>

322
00:17:28,764 --> 00:17:30,125
<font color="yellow">..why don't you say something?</font>

323
00:17:30,165 --> 00:17:31,564
Er...

324
00:17:31,605 --> 00:17:34,084
I haven't got my passport.

325
00:17:38,645 --> 00:17:40,165
<font color="yellow"># Ta-da!</font>

326
00:17:41,645 --> 00:17:44,605
<font color="yellow">Er, I found it yesterday</font>
<font color="yellow">when you were getting ready.</font>

327
00:17:46,324 --> 00:17:47,965
You were looking through my things?

328
00:17:49,004 --> 00:17:50,484
<font color="yellow">Oh, dear.</font>

329
00:17:50,524 --> 00:17:51,925
<font color="yellow">Sorry.</font>

330
00:17:53,244 --> 00:17:54,804
<font color="yellow">I wanted it to be a surprise.</font>

331
00:17:57,004 --> 00:17:58,725
SHE LAUGHS

332
00:17:58,764 --> 00:18:00,885
It's OK, I'm sorry, I...

333
00:18:00,925 --> 00:18:02,844
It's just...

334
00:18:02,885 --> 00:18:05,605
Just a bit of a shock.
<font color="yellow">Good. Let's go.</font>

335
00:18:05,645 --> 00:18:09,844
I can't believe you remembered
me telling you about that trip.

336
00:18:16,524 --> 00:18:19,564
HELEN: <font color="cyan">He's just so different from</font>
<font color="cyan">Dad, though, isn't he? </font>NATALIE: And?

337
00:18:19,605 --> 00:18:21,564
<font color="cyan">That's what I couldn't believe.</font>

338
00:18:21,605 --> 00:18:23,165
<font color="cyan">I mean, so...</font>

339
00:18:23,205 --> 00:18:25,484
<font color="cyan">I don't know, gentlemanly.</font>

340
00:18:25,524 --> 00:18:26,885
Dad was gentlemanly.

341
00:18:26,925 --> 00:18:28,484
<font color="cyan">Oh, not like that.</font>

342
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:30,844
<font color="cyan">Mark couldn't stop looking at her.</font>

343
00:18:30,885 --> 00:18:34,445
<font color="cyan">Filling her glass,</font>
<font color="cyan">touching her arm, smiling at her.</font>

344
00:18:34,484 --> 00:18:35,965
Are you jealous?

345
00:18:36,004 --> 00:18:37,484
<font color="cyan">No.</font>

346
00:18:39,084 --> 00:18:40,844
<font color="cyan">I'm perfectly happy with George.</font>

347
00:18:41,965 --> 00:18:43,324
<font color="cyan">You?</font>

348
00:18:44,605 --> 00:18:46,764
No, I'm very happy on my own,
thanks.

349
00:18:47,844 --> 00:18:49,165
JAKE: <font color="#008000">He's wet.</font>

350
00:18:49,205 --> 00:18:50,965
<font color="#008000">He's too wet for her.</font>

351
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:53,365
<font color="#008000">I mean, Dad was a force</font>
<font color="#008000">to be reckoned with, wasn't it?</font>

352
00:18:53,405 --> 00:18:55,004
<font color="#008000">He had character.</font>

353
00:18:55,044 --> 00:18:56,645
He was no angel.

354
00:18:56,685 --> 00:18:58,445
HE SCOFFS
<font color="#008000">That...</font>

355
00:18:58,484 --> 00:19:01,564
<font color="#008000">Oh, I think that's nothing.</font>
<font color="#008000">I bet that was just, like, one-off.</font>

356
00:19:01,605 --> 00:19:03,165
<font color="#008000">Some one-off event.</font>

357
00:19:03,205 --> 00:19:07,244
<font color="#008000">Look, you know, the most important</font>
<font color="#008000">thing is that they stayed together,</font>

358
00:19:07,284 --> 00:19:08,405
<font color="#008000">didn't they?</font>

359
00:19:08,445 --> 00:19:11,725
<font color="#008000">All those years, over 40 years,</font>
<font color="#008000">they stayed together.</font>

360
00:19:13,004 --> 00:19:14,445
<font color="#008000">That's bloody impressive.</font>

361
00:19:16,645 --> 00:19:19,084
Hey, come on, you'll get Leila back.
Of course you will.

362
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:20,564
<font color="#008000">Hmm.</font>

363
00:19:22,004 --> 00:19:23,365
<font color="#008000">Yeah.</font>

364
00:19:26,445 --> 00:19:28,885
The thing is that I got pregnant
with Helen...

365
00:19:28,925 --> 00:19:31,044
.before Terry and I got married.

366
00:19:32,804 --> 00:19:35,244
So, it was more a marriage of...

367
00:19:36,405 --> 00:19:38,645
..necessity than choice.

368
00:19:38,685 --> 00:19:42,084
<font color="yellow">Well, I don't think that Charlotte</font>
<font color="yellow">and myself had the perfect marriage.</font>

369
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:43,804
<font color="yellow">Not by any means.</font>

370
00:19:45,405 --> 00:19:47,524
<font color="yellow">But I'd always wanted to be...</font>

371
00:19:47,564 --> 00:19:49,044
<font color="yellow">part of a team.</font>

372
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:51,885
<font color="yellow">Someone by your side...</font>

373
00:19:51,925 --> 00:19:53,484
<font color="yellow">rooting for you.</font>

374
00:19:55,645 --> 00:19:58,844
<font color="yellow">And I hope that, one day...</font>

375
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:02,044
<font color="yellow">..we can be a team like that.</font>

376
00:20:03,725 --> 00:20:05,165
What?

377
00:20:07,205 --> 00:20:10,125
Oh, is that what all this is about?

378
00:20:11,244 --> 00:20:13,044
A proposal?

379
00:20:13,084 --> 00:20:16,044
Because, Mark, nothing could
be further from my mind,

380
00:20:16,084 --> 00:20:18,844
at this moment, than marriage.

381
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:19,925
Nothing.

382
00:20:23,885 --> 00:20:25,084
<font color="yellow">A square.</font>

383
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:26,764
<font color="cyan">A TV!</font>
<font color="#008000">OK, Maddie, what else?</font>

384
00:20:27,804 --> 00:20:28,885
<font color="#008000">Hm.</font>

385
00:20:28,925 --> 00:20:30,044
<font color="#008000">Hm, hm, hm.</font>

386
00:20:30,084 --> 00:20:31,244
<font color="cyan">Large...</font>

387
00:20:31,284 --> 00:20:32,725
<font color="#008000">Climbing.</font>
<font color="cyan">Up the stairs.</font>

388
00:20:32,764 --> 00:20:35,004
<font color="yellow">Growing up.</font>
<font color="#008000">Good.</font>

389
00:20:35,044 --> 00:20:37,165
<font color="cyan">James And The Giant Peach!</font>

390
00:20:37,205 --> 00:20:38,645
Don't look at me like that.

391
00:20:38,685 --> 00:20:40,564
You haven't said anything to Helen,
have you?

392
00:20:40,605 --> 00:20:42,405
<font color="yellow">No.</font>
<font color="yellow">No, of course not, but...</font>

393
00:20:43,484 --> 00:20:44,965
<font color="yellow">Oh, I don't know,</font>
<font color="yellow">I just hate to think</font>

394
00:20:45,004 --> 00:20:47,004
<font color="yellow">of you hanging on like this</font>
<font color="yellow">for a man who might...</font>

395
00:20:48,165 --> 00:20:50,324
<font color="yellow">..might not come through for you.</font>

396
00:20:51,564 --> 00:20:52,965
Thank you.

397
00:20:53,004 --> 00:20:54,445
But I can look after myself.

398
00:20:54,484 --> 00:20:55,605
<font color="yellow">I know, I know.</font>

399
00:20:55,645 --> 00:20:58,764
<font color="yellow">But you could so easily find</font>
<font color="yellow">a great guy who adores you.</font>

400
00:20:58,804 --> 00:21:01,685
Please, George.
<font color="yellow">And wants to have kids, like you do.</font>

401
00:21:01,725 --> 00:21:03,445
Oh, Jesus...

402
00:21:03,484 --> 00:21:05,244
I shouldn't have said anything
to you.

403
00:21:06,484 --> 00:21:08,365
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, I didn't...</font>

404
00:21:10,165 --> 00:21:11,965
<font color="cyan">Beauty And The Beast!</font>

405
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:14,405
<font color="yellow">Jack And The Beanstalk!</font>
<font color="#008000">Yay!</font>

406
00:21:14,445 --> 00:21:16,125
THEY CHEER

407
00:21:17,165 --> 00:21:20,564
<font color="#008000">Well, it's your go, then, Maddie.</font>
<font color="#008000">Up you come, yes, yes.</font>

408
00:21:20,605 --> 00:21:22,605
Guys, guys, right, wave to Grandma.

409
00:21:22,645 --> 00:21:24,125
Get a photo!

410
00:21:24,165 --> 00:21:25,605
Wave to Grandma!
<font color="#008000">Cheese!</font>

411
00:21:25,645 --> 00:21:27,445
ALL: Hi!

412
00:21:29,605 --> 00:21:33,165
MARY: I reckon that was the first
Sunday lunch

413
00:21:33,205 --> 00:21:35,004
Vivien had missed since Terry died.

414
00:21:36,084 --> 00:21:40,004
I mean, family traditions
are important, aren't they?

415
00:21:40,044 --> 00:21:42,445
I mean, she began spending...

416
00:21:43,605 --> 00:21:45,764
..all that time with Mark.

417
00:21:46,925 --> 00:21:49,365
I think that's when things
started falling apart.

418
00:22:04,929 --> 00:22:06,530
Oh, hello!

419
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:08,729
Did you have a good trip?
Where did you go?

420
00:22:08,769 --> 00:22:10,130
<font color="yellow">Oh, just over to France.</font>

421
00:22:10,169 --> 00:22:12,409
<font color="yellow">Yes, it was lovely, thanks.</font>

422
00:22:12,449 --> 00:22:13,530
Everything OK?

423
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:14,929
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

424
00:22:14,969 --> 00:22:18,689
<font color="yellow">Sorry, I can't stop, Mary,</font>
<font color="yellow">I'm off to get my hair done.</font>

425
00:22:19,729 --> 00:22:21,449
<font color="yellow">I'll catch you later.</font>
OK.

426
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:27,169
MARY: I knew Vivien
about as well as anyone.

427
00:22:27,209 --> 00:22:29,810
I mean, you can't live next door
all those years

428
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:32,009
and not get to know a person,
can you?

429
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:36,050
We always helped each other out
whenever we could.

430
00:22:42,409 --> 00:22:43,769
HE KNOCKS ON DOOR

431
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:45,449
Oh, hello?

432
00:22:46,929 --> 00:22:48,449
She's out.

433
00:22:48,489 --> 00:22:50,929
But I can take it for her.
<font color="yellow">Oh, great, thanks.</font>

434
00:22:57,530 --> 00:22:59,009
Thank you.
<font color="yellow">Cheers, bye.</font>

435
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:06,570
But although we'd been neighbours
for so long,

436
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:08,489
we didn't live
in each other's pockets.

437
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:11,290
No, I kept myself to myself.
Always have done.

438
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:13,130
It's just who I am.

439
00:23:59,969 --> 00:24:01,370
<font color="yellow">So, what do you think?</font>

440
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:04,610
Oh, good God, we're not going
to knock this down, are we?

441
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:06,810
It'd be a crime.
<font color="yellow">Stables.</font>

442
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:08,090
<font color="yellow">Four-car garage.</font>

443
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:10,009
<font color="yellow">Six beds.</font>
<font color="yellow">A billiards room.</font>

444
00:24:11,209 --> 00:24:12,729
Well, what's this about?

445
00:24:14,009 --> 00:24:15,050
<font color="yellow">Us.</font>

446
00:24:16,409 --> 00:24:18,370
<font color="yellow">You and me... living here.</font>

447
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:20,850
<font color="yellow">I've been on the lookout for ages.</font>

448
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:22,729
<font color="yellow">I haven't found anywhere I thought</font>
<font color="yellow">you'd like.</font>

449
00:24:23,769 --> 00:24:25,090
<font color="yellow">Until now.</font>

450
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:28,489
So, you're actually
finally going to leave Carla?

451
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:31,330
And this is for us?

452
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:34,769
<font color="yellow">You've been so patient, Nats,</font>
<font color="yellow">all this time.</font>

453
00:24:36,009 --> 00:24:37,570
<font color="yellow">If you like it...</font>

454
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:41,209
<font color="yellow">..I'll put in an offer on Monday.</font>
<font color="yellow">I promise.</font>

455
00:24:46,209 --> 00:24:47,449
Mum...

456
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:50,810
Mum...

457
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:52,209
<font color="cyan">Hi, darling.</font>

458
00:24:52,249 --> 00:24:54,729
Have we got any photos of Grandad
from when he was in hospital?

459
00:24:54,769 --> 00:24:57,009
<font color="cyan">I don't think so. Why?</font>

460
00:24:57,050 --> 00:24:58,610
I'm doing a post on death.

461
00:24:59,729 --> 00:25:02,050
<font color="cyan">What?</font>
It's for my followers.

462
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:04,969
I should have taken one of him just
after he died.

463
00:25:05,009 --> 00:25:06,009
That would've been cool.

464
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:08,890
<font color="cyan">Yeah, no, that would have been</font>
<font color="cyan">incredibly disrespectful.</font>

465
00:25:08,929 --> 00:25:12,090
Well, you didn't respect him.
You were always arguing with him.

466
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:14,290
<font color="cyan">No, I wasn't. </font>You used to shout
at him all the time.

467
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:16,489
Just like you shout at Dad.
You're always angry.

468
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:17,890
<font color="cyan">I am not...</font>

469
00:25:21,209 --> 00:25:22,530
<font color="cyan">Lily...</font>

470
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:24,689
<font color="cyan">people argue all the time.</font>

471
00:25:24,729 --> 00:25:27,050
<font color="cyan">It doesn't mean they don't love</font>
<font color="cyan">each other.</font>

472
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:28,449
Yeah, right.

473
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:30,890
<font color="#008000">I just...</font>

474
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:32,409
<font color="#008000">I want our little family back.</font>

475
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:36,570
<font color="#008000">I want you back.</font>

476
00:25:38,009 --> 00:25:39,650
And the money?

477
00:25:40,729 --> 00:25:43,249
<font color="#008000">Look, I'm working all the hours</font>
<font color="#008000">God made.</font>

478
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:45,769
<font color="#008000">Leila, I'm paying back the debt</font>
<font color="#008000">week by week.</font>

479
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:48,489
When will you be clear?

480
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:52,810
<font color="#008000">Six months or so.</font>
<font color="#008000">It's going to be quicker, if I can.</font>

481
00:25:54,009 --> 00:25:56,290
A lot can happen in six months.

482
00:25:56,330 --> 00:26:00,570
I don't really want to discuss it
until you've paid back every penny.

483
00:26:08,009 --> 00:26:09,689
Jake...

484
00:26:09,729 --> 00:26:10,969
No.

485
00:26:18,769 --> 00:26:22,409
MARK: <font color="yellow">I've been thinking about</font>
<font color="yellow">that conversation we had in France.</font>

486
00:26:22,449 --> 00:26:24,090
Me, too.

487
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:27,890
<font color="yellow">And I realise it was far too soon</font>
<font color="yellow">to mention marriage.</font>

488
00:26:29,489 --> 00:26:30,769
<font color="yellow">Erm...</font>

489
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:33,130
<font color="yellow">It was stupid of me.</font>

490
00:26:33,169 --> 00:26:35,330
No, it's OK.
<font color="yellow">I'm really sorry.</font>

491
00:26:36,409 --> 00:26:38,610
<font color="yellow">I messed up.</font>
It's just that...

492
00:26:39,769 --> 00:26:41,130
SHE SIGHS

493
00:26:42,409 --> 00:26:45,330
..after a lifetime
of looking after other people, I...

494
00:26:46,729 --> 00:26:48,890
..I like the independence
I have now.

495
00:26:48,929 --> 00:26:51,090
<font color="yellow">I understand that, of course,</font>
<font color="yellow">completely.</font>

496
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:53,610
It doesn't mean
that I don't love you.

497
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:03,729
<font color="yellow">Can I just ask...</font>

498
00:27:04,929 --> 00:27:07,729
<font color="yellow">..does this mean that marriage</font>
<font color="yellow">is out of the question for you...</font>

499
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:10,489
<font color="yellow">..forever?</font>
No, no!

500
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:12,370
SHE CHUCKLES

501
00:27:12,409 --> 00:27:14,850
But we've got years ahead of us,
don't we?

502
00:27:15,929 --> 00:27:17,850
<font color="yellow">Do we?</font>

503
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:20,009
<font color="yellow">Well, hopefully, yes.</font>

504
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:25,290
<font color="yellow">It's just I wouldn't</font>
<font color="yellow">like to think...</font>

505
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:27,530
<font color="yellow">you'd rule it out completely.</font>

506
00:27:30,209 --> 00:27:31,610
Come on.

507
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:42,209
<font color="cyan">Hi, darling.</font>

508
00:27:42,249 --> 00:27:43,570
<font color="cyan">Hey, Natalie.</font>
Hey.

509
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:45,610
<font color="yellow">Ruby, come on!</font>
DOG BARKS

510
00:27:47,929 --> 00:27:50,689
<font color="cyan">How are you?</font>
Oh, yeah, great, thanks.

511
00:27:52,729 --> 00:27:55,290
<font color="cyan">Time for a cup of tea,</font>
<font color="cyan">or a glass of something?</font>

512
00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:57,330
Oh, no, I've got to get back.
<font color="cyan">Aw...</font>

513
00:27:57,370 --> 00:28:00,090
<font color="cyan">Well, we haven't seen you properly</font>
<font color="cyan">in ages.</font>

514
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:02,330
<font color="cyan">Even the girls are asking after you.</font>
Aw.

515
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:04,969
<font color="cyan">We should have her round for dinner</font>
<font color="cyan">one evening, shouldn't we?</font>

516
00:28:06,009 --> 00:28:07,650
<font color="yellow">Yeah, yeah, that would be lovely.</font>

517
00:28:07,689 --> 00:28:09,290
<font color="cyan">We'll arrange something.</font>

518
00:28:10,449 --> 00:28:13,689
<font color="cyan">I'll email you some dates, shall I?</font>
Oh, yeah, lovely.

519
00:28:18,969 --> 00:28:22,810
<font color="cyan">I know what you're doing, Natalie.</font>
<font color="cyan">And you can never win.</font>

520
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:24,769
<font color="cyan">Never.</font>

521
00:28:26,969 --> 00:28:28,090
<font color="cyan">Bye!</font>

522
00:28:34,769 --> 00:28:36,489
CAR STARTS

523
00:28:49,969 --> 00:28:52,130
STELLA: Jake, I'll see you
downstairs.

524
00:29:01,209 --> 00:29:02,929
Oh, erm...

525
00:29:02,969 --> 00:29:05,409
One of my rentals
is due to come vacant soon.

526
00:29:05,449 --> 00:29:06,769
The top floor flat.

527
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:08,009
That might work for you.

528
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:09,610
<font color="#008000">Yeah, well, it sounds lovely,</font>
<font color="#008000">Stella.</font>

529
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:11,610
<font color="#008000">It also sounds very expensive.</font>

530
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:14,290
<font color="#008000">And I'm trying to save every penny</font>
<font color="#008000">I can at the minute, thank you.</font>

531
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:17,009
Erm, actually...

532
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:20,090
..I thought you could have it
rent-free

533
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:23,570
in exchange for the personal
training sessions and the odd...

534
00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:26,570
..evening here.

535
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:28,050
I mean, we could...

536
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:29,689
do away with all of this.

537
00:29:31,449 --> 00:29:32,929
<font color="#008000">Oh, er...</font>

538
00:29:32,969 --> 00:29:34,009
<font color="#008000">Well, bloody hell.</font>

539
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:35,090
<font color="#008000">Er...</font>

540
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:38,090
<font color="#008000">No.</font>

541
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:41,449
<font color="#008000">I don't think I can accept that,</font>
<font color="#008000">Stella.</font>

542
00:29:41,489 --> 00:29:42,689
OK.

543
00:29:42,729 --> 00:29:44,969
I mean, it was just an idea.

544
00:29:45,009 --> 00:29:47,290
I thought I could kill two birds
with one stone.

545
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:50,169
But no pressure. I totally
understand if it doesn't feel right.

546
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:52,969
I'll see you Thursday.

547
00:29:53,009 --> 00:29:54,409
<font color="#008000">Er, yeah.</font>

548
00:29:55,969 --> 00:29:58,209
<font color="#008000">Yep. See you Thursday.</font>

549
00:30:02,249 --> 00:30:03,810
DOOR CLOSES

550
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:07,489
TELEVISION ON, CHUCKLING

551
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:14,890
SHE GIGGLES

552
00:30:19,009 --> 00:30:20,530
Oh, God...

553
00:30:38,409 --> 00:30:41,370
VIVIEN: Mark's on his way over
and he's bringing some supper.

554
00:30:41,409 --> 00:30:43,009
We're going to watch a film.

555
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:44,570
Why don't you stay?

556
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:46,729
He always makes far too much.

557
00:30:46,769 --> 00:30:50,009
<font color="yellow">No, no, I'll leave you two lovebirds</font>
<font color="yellow">alone.</font>

558
00:30:56,530 --> 00:31:00,169
<font color="yellow">But, erm, before he gets here,</font>
<font color="yellow">I wanted to ask you something.</font>

559
00:31:00,209 --> 00:31:03,370
<font color="yellow">I've been thinking about what you</font>
<font color="yellow">said about Dad.</font>

560
00:31:03,409 --> 00:31:05,169
Oh, God...

561
00:31:05,209 --> 00:31:06,689
<font color="yellow">"No angel."</font>

562
00:31:06,729 --> 00:31:08,850
<font color="yellow">Does that mean...</font>

563
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:11,169
<font color="yellow">He had affairs, didn't he?</font>

564
00:31:11,209 --> 00:31:12,409
Just the one.

565
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:16,009
But it went on for some years.

<font color="yellow">Jesus...</font>

567
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:21,929
<font color="yellow">But you didn't leave him.</font>
<font color="yellow">Why not?</font>

568
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:25,969
I...

569
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:31,209
I said that, if he gave her up, then
I promised I wouldn't tell you kids.

570
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:34,850
And he did.

571
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:37,489
<font color="yellow">Do you know what happened</font>
<font color="yellow">to the other woman?</font>

572
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:39,050
No, I don't know.

573
00:31:40,209 --> 00:31:42,729
And I don't care.
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

574
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:46,530
Look...

575
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:49,409
Why don't you pop in again soon, hm?

576
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:51,409
And we can talk properly.

577
00:31:51,449 --> 00:31:52,729
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

578
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:56,090
<font color="yellow">You really like him, don't you?</font>

579
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:57,330
<font color="yellow">Mark.</font>

580
00:31:57,370 --> 00:31:59,650
You think he's all right?

581
00:31:59,689 --> 00:32:01,169
<font color="yellow">I think he's great.</font>

582
00:32:02,169 --> 00:32:03,969
<font color="yellow">Really great.</font>

583
00:32:04,009 --> 00:32:06,409
<font color="yellow">Because he makes you so happy.</font>

584
00:32:07,489 --> 00:32:09,050
<font color="yellow">All right, bye.</font>

585
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:55,090
Hello.

586
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:56,489

<font color="cyan">So...</font>

589
00:33:13,969 --> 00:33:15,409
<font color="cyan">that's a no, then, is it?</font>

590
00:33:15,449 --> 00:33:17,169
I'm just near
the end of the chapter.

591
00:33:17,209 --> 00:33:19,810
<font color="cyan">Or you're in the middle of a</font>
<font color="cyan">chapter. Or the start of a chapter.</font>

592
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:21,409
<font color="cyan">Or you're...</font>

593
00:33:21,449 --> 00:33:25,009
<font color="cyan">You're very stoned or...</font>
Don't, Helen, please. <font color="cyan">..tired.</font>

594
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:26,330
<font color="cyan">Well, it comes to something</font>

595
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:28,249
<font color="cyan">when your own mum's</font>
<font color="cyan">having more sex than you.</font>

596
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:32,249
<font color="cyan">You never initiate anything.</font>

597
00:33:33,249 --> 00:33:35,409
That's because you're the initiator,
aren't you?

598
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:39,130
You're the boss
and I'm just the employee.

599
00:33:40,449 --> 00:33:43,890
If I'm not performing, well,
we'll have to get tough, won't we?

600
00:33:43,929 --> 00:33:45,530
<font color="cyan">Oh, come on...</font>

601
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:48,130
I'm not a project for you to manage.

602
00:33:49,769 --> 00:33:52,330
Sex isn't like that.
And it doesn't respond to demands.

MARK: <font color="yellow">Ah, she's awake.</font>

613
00:35:13,025 --> 00:35:14,264
Hello.

614
00:35:16,025 --> 00:35:17,105
<font color="yellow">How are you feeling?</font>

615
00:35:18,384 --> 00:35:19,944
Fine.

616
00:35:20,904 --> 00:35:23,185
Actually, I slept well, Doctor.

617
00:35:24,185 --> 00:35:25,585
<font color="yellow">Your pulse is regular.</font>

618

<font color="yellow">Drink this.</font>

619
00:35:28,705 --> 00:35:30,424
<font color="yellow">You need to keep your fluids up.</font>

620
00:35:30,464 --> 00:35:33,105
<font color="yellow">And you might want</font>
<font color="yellow">to take one of these.</font>

621
00:35:33,145 --> 00:35:34,864
What are they?

622
00:35:34,904 --> 00:35:36,665
<font color="yellow">It's a very mild tranquilliser,</font>

623
00:35:36,705 --> 00:35:39,585
<font color="yellow">just to get you through lunch</font>
<font color="yellow">with the kids and everything.</font>

624
00:35:39,625 --> 00:35:41,065
<font color="yellow">It's up to yourself.</font>

625
00:35:41,105 --> 00:35:43,705
<font color="yellow">Only take it if you're feeling</font>
<font color="yellow">the need.</font>

626
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:45,065
Thanks.

627
00:35:46,985 --> 00:35:48,665
You're being so thoughtful.

628
00:35:49,824 --> 00:35:51,185
<font color="yellow">Nonsense.</font>

629
00:35:52,264 --> 00:35:53,904
<font color="yellow">But I think I could...</font>

00:35:53,944 --> 00:35:57,065
<font color="yellow">run to a nice slice of toast</font>
<font color="yellow">without burning the kitchen down,</font>

631
00:35:57,105 --> 00:35:58,944
<font color="yellow">if you felt up to it.</font>

632
00:36:00,025 --> 00:36:01,424
Yes, please.

633
00:36:04,344 --> 00:36:05,824
<font color="yellow">You're going to be fine.</font>

00:36:06,944 --> 00:36:08,424

BEDROOM DOOR CLOSES

636
00:36:59,185 --> 00:37:01,145
VIVIEN: I mean,
it was the oddest thing.

637
00:37:01,185 --> 00:37:02,625
One minute, I was fine,
and then...

638
00:37:02,665 --> 00:37:03,784
MARK: <font color="yellow">Then she collapsed.</font>

639

<font color="cyan">when I left here.</font>

640
00:37:05,744 --> 00:37:07,545
<font color="#008000">So, what is it, then?</font>

641
00:37:07,585 --> 00:37:09,784
<font color="yellow">Well, we can't be certain, but...</font>

00:37:09,824 --> 00:37:11,985
<font color="#008000">I'm sorry, I'd like to hear from my</font>
<font color="#008000">mum, please.</font>

643
00:37:13,025 --> 00:37:14,264
Oh, well...

644
00:37:15,625 --> 00:37:18,065
They're not sure if it's
just a one-off thing

645
00:37:18,105 --> 00:37:19,985
or a symptom of something serious.

646
00:37:20,025 --> 00:37:22,185
I mean...
<font color="cyan">Oh, God.</font>

647
00:37:22,225 --> 00:37:24,185
They've done a raft of tests
and now...

648
00:37:24,225 --> 00:37:26,225
we just have to wait
for the results.

649
00:37:26,264 --> 00:37:29,025
<font color="cyan">Well, look, I think we should</font>
<font color="cyan">set up a rota system.</font>

650
00:37:29,065 --> 00:37:31,225
<font color="#008000">Yeah.</font>
<font color="cyan">One of us coming in every day.</font>

651
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:34,264
<font color="#008000">Yeah, that's a good idea. I can do</font>
<font color="#008000">that, just to keep an eye on you.</font>

652
00:37:34,304 --> 00:37:36,505
<font color="cyan">Yeah, we'll cook a meal</font>
<font color="cyan">or something. It's no trouble.</font>

653
00:37:36,545 --> 00:37:39,025
No, no.
No, no, it is trouble for you, so...

654
00:37:39,065 --> 00:37:40,744
Well, actually...

655
00:37:40,784 --> 00:37:43,904
Mark has very kindly said
that he'll come and stay for a bit.

656
00:37:44,904 --> 00:37:47,025
<font color="#008000">Here, in our house?</font>

657
00:37:47,065 --> 00:37:48,665
Just for a week or two.

658
00:37:48,705 --> 00:37:51,225
You know,
just till the results come through.

659
00:37:51,264 --> 00:37:53,424
And I'll be in
the best medical hands.

660
00:37:53,464 --> 00:37:55,585
So, none of you need worry.

661
00:37:55,625 --> 00:37:56,864
<font color="cyan">But, Mum...</font>

662
00:37:56,904 --> 00:38:00,185
<font color="cyan">No offence, Mark,</font>
<font color="cyan">but we don't know you very well yet.</font>

663
00:38:00,225 --> 00:38:03,145
<font color="cyan">And naturally we...</font>
<font color="#008000">Well, we don't know him at all.</font>

664
00:38:03,185 --> 00:38:05,665
<font color="#008000">And, Mum, that is our job.</font>

665
00:38:05,705 --> 00:38:08,985
<font color="yellow">Look, let's calm down.</font>
<font color="yellow">I don't want to tread on any toes.</font>

666
00:38:09,025 --> 00:38:11,864
Look, and if
there was another episode,

667
00:38:11,904 --> 00:38:14,145
then Mark would know exactly
what to do.

668
00:38:14,185 --> 00:38:15,864
<font color="yellow">I could monitor the hospital tests,</font>

669
00:38:15,904 --> 00:38:17,824
<font color="yellow">make sure they haven't missed</font>
<font color="yellow">anything.</font>

670
00:38:17,864 --> 00:38:20,065
<font color="cyan">Well, that is important.</font>
<font color="#008000">Oh, come on.</font>

671
00:38:21,384 --> 00:38:23,185
<font color="#008000">We can do that.</font>

672
00:38:23,225 --> 00:38:25,185
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry if you feel uncomfortable</font>
<font color="yellow">about that.</font>

673
00:38:25,225 --> 00:38:28,904
<font color="cyan">No, no, no. Look, what is important</font>
<font color="cyan">is that Mum's happy.</font>

674
00:38:28,944 --> 00:38:30,065
<font color="cyan">Isn't it, Jake?</font>

675
00:38:31,585 --> 00:38:32,985
Thank you.

676
00:38:34,464 --> 00:38:36,225
And I am, hundred percent.

677
00:38:37,344 --> 00:38:39,505
INSPECTOR: <font color="yellow">And then Vivien suddenly</font>
<font color="yellow">became unwell?</font>

678
00:38:39,545 --> 00:38:41,185
Yes, and that was so...

679
00:38:42,505 --> 00:38:43,744
..out of the blue.

680
00:38:43,784 --> 00:38:46,065
<font color="yellow">How did the children react</font>
<font color="yellow">to their mother's illness?</font>

681
00:38:46,105 --> 00:38:48,784
Well, you know,
they all rallied round.

682
00:38:49,904 --> 00:38:52,585
<font color="yellow">A large gin and tonic.</font>
<font color="cyan">Thanks.</font>

683
00:38:52,625 --> 00:38:55,185
<font color="#008000">So, that's two drinks here,</font>
<font color="#008000">one at Mum's.</font>

684
00:38:55,225 --> 00:38:56,705
<font color="#008000">That's almost six units of alcohol.</font>

685
00:38:56,744 --> 00:38:59,864
<font color="cyan">You're just jealous because I can</font>
<font color="cyan">hold my drink and you can't.</font>

686
00:38:59,904 --> 00:39:02,105
<font color="#008000">No, you think you can.</font>
<font color="#008000">That's what alcohol does for you.</font>

687
00:39:02,145 --> 00:39:04,304
Oh, stop it, you two.
<font color="cyan">Anyway, back to Mum.</font>

688
00:39:04,344 --> 00:39:06,065
<font color="#008000">I hope you're not considering</font>
<font color="#008000">driving home.</font>

689
00:39:06,105 --> 00:39:08,344
<font color="cyan">We don't really know</font>
<font color="cyan">her financial position.</font>

690
00:39:08,384 --> 00:39:11,185
You were the one helping her with it
all after Dad died, weren't you?

691
00:39:11,225 --> 00:39:13,065
Surely you've got some idea.

692
00:39:13,105 --> 00:39:15,505
<font color="cyan">Yeah, well, I know she owns</font>
<font color="cyan">the house outright</font>

693
00:39:15,545 --> 00:39:17,384
<font color="cyan">and there are some savings.</font>

694
00:39:17,424 --> 00:39:19,824
<font color="cyan">But most of what Dad left</font>
<font color="cyan">is in shares,</font>

695
00:39:19,864 --> 00:39:22,344
<font color="cyan">which she said have been doing well,</font>
<font color="cyan">so she's certainly...</font>

696
00:39:22,384 --> 00:39:23,705
<font color="#008000">She's loaded.</font>

697
00:39:23,744 --> 00:39:26,985
You don't honestly think that he's
only after her for her money?

698
00:39:27,025 --> 00:39:29,424
You only have to look at them
to see that they're in love.

699
00:39:29,464 --> 00:39:30,904
<font color="#008000">Oh, come on.</font>
<font color="#008000">Bullshit.</font>

700
00:39:30,944 --> 00:39:33,225
<font color="#008000">They hardly know each other.</font>
<font color="#008000">It's infatuation.</font>

701
00:39:33,264 --> 00:39:36,384
He can't get his hands on her money
anyway, not without her permission.

702
00:39:36,424 --> 00:39:39,025
<font color="#008000">What? Of course he can. You know</font>
<font color="#008000">what Mum's like with security.</font>

703
00:39:39,065 --> 00:39:41,585
<font color="#008000">He's probably already got all of her</font>
<font color="#008000">PIN numbers and passwords.</font>

704
00:39:41,625 --> 00:39:43,384
<font color="cyan">Yeah, one of us should have</font>
<font color="cyan">power of attorney</font>

705
00:39:43,424 --> 00:39:45,585
<font color="cyan">in case she has another one</font>
<font color="cyan">of those episodes.</font>

706
00:39:45,625 --> 00:39:48,384
For God's sake, you two. Look, this
is about two people being in love.

707
00:39:48,424 --> 00:39:50,904
We should be cheering them on,
not obsessing about the money.

708
00:39:50,944 --> 00:39:52,264
<font color="#008000">Money might mean nothing to you</font>

709
00:39:52,304 --> 00:39:53,944
<font color="#008000">because you haven't got</font>
<font color="#008000">any dependents.</font>

710
00:39:53,985 --> 00:39:56,545
<font color="#008000">You think nothing of spending £1,000</font>
<font color="#008000">on a handbag.</font>

711
00:39:56,585 --> 00:39:59,065
<font color="cyan">Oh, she doesn't pay for those bags.</font>
What the fuck do you know?

712
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:01,025
<font color="#008000">You don't go short on anything,</font>
<font color="#008000">either.</font>

713
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:03,344
<font color="cyan">That's not fair.</font>
<font color="cyan">Wages in the public sector...</font>

714
00:40:03,384 --> 00:40:05,784
And you've got George at home
waiting on you hand and foot.

715
00:40:05,824 --> 00:40:07,784
I've had to work bloody hard
for where I've got.

716
00:40:07,824 --> 00:40:08,904
<font color="cyan">What, and I haven't?</font>

717
00:40:08,944 --> 00:40:11,505
<font color="cyan">As I recall, Dad gave you</font>
<font color="cyan">the deposit for your flat.</font>

718
00:40:11,545 --> 00:40:13,105
<font color="#008000">Did he?</font>
<font color="cyan">Yeah.</font>

719
00:40:13,145 --> 00:40:15,105
<font color="cyan">Whereas Jake and I</font>
<font color="cyan">had nothing to get us started.</font>

720
00:40:15,145 --> 00:40:17,505
Oh, for fuck's sake,
that was ages ago.

721
00:40:17,545 --> 00:40:20,824
Anyway, it was only ten grand.
<font color="#008000">Ten grand?</font>

722
00:40:20,864 --> 00:40:23,145
Do you want me to divide it
all up and write you a cheque now?

723
00:40:23,185 --> 00:40:25,344
Is the money really that important
to you?

724
00:40:25,384 --> 00:40:27,784
<font color="cyan">It's not the amount,</font>
<font color="cyan">it's the principle. </font><font color="#008000">It's the amount.</font>

725
00:40:27,824 --> 00:40:31,145
<font color="#008000">Yeah, I will have a cheque.</font>
Oh, you two are unbelievable.

726
00:40:31,185 --> 00:40:32,744
<font color="#008000">Sorry, Dad gave her ten grand,</font>

727
00:40:32,784 --> 00:40:34,944
<font color="#008000">you knew about it</font>
<font color="#008000">and you didn't tell me?</font>

728
00:40:34,985 --> 00:40:37,464
<font color="#008000">Fuck it. We should all get</font>
<font color="#008000">ten grand, shouldn't we?</font>

729
00:40:37,505 --> 00:40:39,665
<font color="cyan">What, so you can spunk it all</font>
<font color="cyan">on a horse at the bookies?</font>

730
00:40:41,065 --> 00:40:43,065
<font color="#008000">Wow, wow, wow...</font>

731
00:40:43,105 --> 00:40:47,105
<font color="#008000">You really are such a little bitch,</font>
<font color="#008000">aren't you?</font>

732
00:40:48,105 --> 00:40:49,545
<font color="#008000">Do you know who I pity?</font>

733
00:40:49,585 --> 00:40:50,985
<font color="#008000">George.</font>

734
00:41:24,585 --> 00:41:26,264
TONY: <font color="yellow">'Hi, I can't come to the phone</font>
<font color="yellow">now,</font>

737
00:41:47,784 --> 00:41:50,904
COUGHING AND RETCHING

738
00:41:52,065 --> 00:41:53,585
Oh...

739
00:41:55,665 --> 00:41:57,784
SHE VOMITS

740
00:42:00,225 --> 00:42:03,264
COUGHING AND RETCHING CONTINUES

741
00:42:03,304 --> 00:42:04,505
Oh...

742
00:42:06,424 --> 00:42:07,864
Oh...

743
00:42:09,145 --> 00:42:11,424
PHONE RINGS

744
00:42:15,145 --> 00:42:16,864
Hey, you.
<font color="#008000">Hey.</font>

745
00:42:16,904 --> 00:42:19,344

748
00:42:23,105 --> 00:42:25,225
<font color="#008000">It will be temporary.</font>

749
00:42:25,264 --> 00:42:27,145
Yeah. Of course.

750
00:42:27,185 --> 00:42:28,545
<font color="#008000">Yeah?</font>

753
00:42:35,625 --> 00:42:38,065
RINGING TONE

TONY: <font color="yellow">'Nats, what the hell are you</font>
<font color="yellow">playing at?'</font>

755
00:42:41,424 --> 00:42:43,304
I need to talk to you.

756
00:42:43,344 --> 00:42:44,864
<font color="yellow">'Well, I can't talk now.</font>

00:42:47,384 --> 00:42:48,824
I've, er...

759
00:42:50,344 --> 00:42:52,705
I've done a test and it's positive.

760

<font color="yellow">'What?'</font>

HE HANGS UP

767
00:43:14,065 --> 00:43:15,665
Urgh!

768
00:43:28,464 --> 00:43:29,985
Thank you for being here.

769
00:43:31,665 --> 00:43:34,944
Most men would have run a mile
in the scenario.

770
00:43:37,105 --> 00:43:38,705
<font color="yellow">No question of that, Viv.</font>

<font color="yellow">This is it for me.</font>

773
00:43:49,344 --> 00:43:50,665
Your...

774
00:43:52,304 --> 00:43:54,185
..question still stands, then...

775
00:43:56,225 --> 00:43:57,545
..about marriage?

776
00:43:58,665 --> 00:43:59,824
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

777
00:44:01,264 --> 00:44:02,505
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

778
00:44:07,424 --> 00:44:09,264
<font color="yellow">Whenever you're ready.</font>

779
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:37,744
INSPECTOR: <font color="yellow">Thank you, Mrs Bennett.</font>

<font color="yellow">at the police station.</font>

782
00:44:41,545 --> 00:44:43,225
Formal statement?

783
00:44:43,264 --> 00:44:44,904
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

784
00:44:44,944 --> 00:44:47,145
<font color="yellow">A person is fighting for their life</font>
<font color="yellow">in hospital.</font>

785
00:44:47,185 --> 00:44:48,784
But...

786
00:44:48,824 --> 00:44:51,264
But it was an accident.
<font color="yellow">Maybe.</font>

787
00:44:51,304 --> 00:44:52,985
<font color="yellow">Maybe not.</font>

788
00:44:54,105 --> 00:44:56,344
<font color="yellow">But if it's not...</font>

789
00:44:56,384 --> 00:44:59,105
<font color="yellow">and the news from the hospital</font>
<font color="yellow">isn't good...</font>

790
00:44:59,145 --> 00:45:00,585
<font color="yellow">then it's murder.</font>

791
00:45:02,065 --> 00:45:03,424
<font color="yellow">Oh, thank you for the tea.</font>
