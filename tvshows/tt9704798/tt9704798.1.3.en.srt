1
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:04,170
But you love this house!

2
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:05,970
<font color="yellow">I'm going to be doing</font>
<font color="yellow">a lot more travelling.</font>

3
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:07,569
<font color="cyan">Mum, do we not get a say in this?</font>

4
00:00:07,609 --> 00:00:10,410
Mum, you've just been in hospital.
<font color="#008000">What if you have another attack?</font>

5
00:00:10,449 --> 00:00:13,449
<font color="yellow">I do not want to end up like Mary</font>
<font color="yellow">next door.</font>

6
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:17,249
Would you describe your family
as hot-tempered?

7
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:19,850
<font color="#008000">No. Not especially, no.</font>

8
00:00:19,889 --> 00:00:21,569
But what about your private lives?

9
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:22,970
<font color="#008000">Well, my brother and sister</font>

10
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:25,729
<font color="#008000">were having marital problems</font>
<font color="#008000">if that's what you mean.</font>

11
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:28,290
<font color="yellow">Our daughter ran away from home.</font>

12
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:30,929
<font color="yellow">Someone sent her a picture</font>
<font color="yellow">of her dad.</font>

13
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:33,490
<font color="yellow">Someone who says he's her new</font>
<font color="yellow">boyfriend.</font>

14
00:00:33,529 --> 00:00:35,690
Mum on the phone.
She's on her way back from lunch.

15
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:37,209
<font color="#008000">With a man.</font>
<font color="cyan">What man?</font>

16
00:00:37,249 --> 00:00:39,810
<font color="cyan">It is my business who my wife is</font>
<font color="cyan">sleeping with, OK?</font>

17
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:41,450
<font color="yellow">Get off me.</font>

18
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:43,810
<font color="#008000">I'm pregnant.</font>
'What?'

19
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:45,050
<font color="cyan">'And you?'</font>

20
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,450
<font color="#008000">'Being single for me,</font>
<font color="#008000">life's less complicated.'</font>

21
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:48,929
<font color="#008000">Shit.</font>

22
00:00:48,969 --> 00:00:51,889
<font color="yellow">We are going to Spain for a few days</font>
<font color="yellow">to meet Mark's daughter.</font>

23
00:00:51,929 --> 00:00:52,969
She's really sorry.

24
00:00:53,009 --> 00:00:55,249
She was so looking forward
to meeting you.

25
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:56,730
<font color="cyan">'Have you just seen Mum's text?'</font>

26
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:57,770
BOTH: <font color="yellow">'Yeah.'</font>

27
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:00,170
<font color="cyan">Holy shit.</font>

28
00:01:00,209 --> 00:01:02,130
<font color="#008000">'Did she tell you about car?</font>
<font color="#008000">It's unbelievable.'</font>

29
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:03,410
<font color="cyan">No, it's too much.</font>

30
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:05,929
He could have bought it on credit,
I suppose, couldn't he?

31
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:07,449
<font color="cyan">What?</font>

32
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:08,610
<font color="#008000">Get back! Get back!</font>
<font color="yellow">Leave it!</font>

33
00:01:08,649 --> 00:01:10,449
<font color="#008000">It's gonna blow!</font>
BOOM

34
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:13,209
<font color="cyan">And now they're married, he stands</font>
<font color="cyan">to inherit all of her money.</font>

35
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:16,410
<font color="yellow">And he was right there with her</font>
<font color="yellow">when she collapsed.</font>

36
00:01:16,449 --> 00:01:18,809
What did his first wife die of?

00:01:52,929 --> 00:01:54,130
<font color="yellow">Sorry.</font>

40
00:01:54,169 --> 00:01:56,330
{\an8}Natalie told me you got married
when you were away.

41
00:01:56,369 --> 00:01:58,530
{\an8}I had no idea.
Congratulations!

42
00:01:58,569 --> 00:02:00,369
{\an8}<font color="yellow">Oh, yes, snap decision.</font>

43
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:02,330
{\an8}<font color="yellow">I was coming over to tell you,</font>
<font color="yellow">Mary, and I...</font>

44
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:05,690
{\an8}Oh, that's all right.
I'm so pleased for you.

45
00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:07,970
{\an8}Oh, sorry about the car.

46
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:09,930
{\an8}How's Mark taken it?

47
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:11,930
<font color="yellow">Well, he's reported it</font>
<font color="yellow">to the police,</font>

48
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:14,130
<font color="yellow">but they're not sounding</font>
<font color="yellow">very hopeful.</font>

49
00:02:14,169 --> 00:02:16,329
Oh, dear.
But you're feeling OK?

50
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,650
Your test results are due back
tomorrow, aren't they?

51
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:20,690
<font color="yellow">Yes, yes.</font>
<font color="yellow">And I feel fine.</font>

52
00:02:20,729 --> 00:02:23,250
<font color="yellow">I mean, great for a woman</font>
<font color="yellow">of my advanced years.</font>

53
00:02:23,289 --> 00:02:26,569
Oh, come on,
70 isn't old these days.

54
00:02:27,769 --> 00:02:30,049
Are you having a birthday party?
<font color="yellow">Oh, no, no.</font>

55
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:32,250
<font color="yellow">We're off to India the next day.</font>

56
00:02:32,289 --> 00:02:36,489
<font color="yellow">No, I expect we'll just, you know,</font>
<font color="yellow">raise a glass of champagne,</font>

57
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:38,049
<font color="yellow">just the family.</font>

58
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:40,690
And when you get back,

59
00:02:40,729 --> 00:02:43,009
you'll be concentrating on moving,
I suppose.

60
00:02:43,049 --> 00:02:44,650
CAR HORN TOOTS

61
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:48,609
End of an era.

62
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:52,009
<font color="yellow">We'll stay in touch, Mary.</font>

63
00:02:52,049 --> 00:02:53,410
<font color="yellow">Of course we will.</font>

64
00:02:55,569 --> 00:02:57,169
<font color="yellow">I'd better go.</font>

65
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:22,410
JAKE: Why am I still here?

66
00:03:22,449 --> 00:03:24,889
Can somebody please tell me
what's going on at the hospital?

67
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:26,930
<font color="yellow">The patient is still unconscious,</font>
<font color="yellow">I'm afraid.</font>

68
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:30,090
<font color="yellow">The next 24 hours will be critical.</font>

69
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:32,650
<font color="yellow">And we're still waiting</font>
<font color="yellow">for toxicology reports.</font>

70
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:33,970
Hm.

71
00:03:34,009 --> 00:03:35,210
OK.

72
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:39,090
<font color="yellow">So, when your mother</font>
<font color="yellow">married Mark Kinneally,</font>

73
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:41,289
<font color="yellow">your father hadn't been dead</font>
<font color="yellow">very long, had he?</font>

74
00:03:41,329 --> 00:03:42,810
No.

75
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:44,449
Erm...

76
00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:45,810
18 months.

77
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,329
<font color="yellow">Were you close to your father?</font>

78
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:50,930
What? Yeah, of course.

79
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:52,609
Yeah, he was a great dad.

80
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:54,810
SCHOOL BELL RINGS

81
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:56,289
Hey, hey!

82
00:03:56,329 --> 00:03:57,690
How are you?
<font color="cyan">Good.</font>

83
00:03:57,729 --> 00:03:58,889
How was maths?
<font color="cyan">Good.</font>

84
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:00,009
English?
<font color="#008000">Good.</font>

85
00:04:00,049 --> 00:04:01,609
Well done.
That's good, isn't it?

86
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:03,410
Hey.
What are you doing here?

87
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:07,289
I thought we could collect them
both together today.

88
00:04:07,329 --> 00:04:09,009
Can you get your bags?

89
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:12,049
<font color="yellow">I pick them up on Tuesdays.</font>

90
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:14,210
<font color="yellow">Let's just stick to the plan, yeah?</font>

91
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:19,330
<font color="#008000">Where's Daddy going?</font>
<font color="yellow">He's, erm...</font>

92
00:04:19,369 --> 00:04:21,609
<font color="yellow">He's busy.</font>
<font color="yellow">He'll be back tomorrow.</font>

93
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:23,489
<font color="#008000">OK.</font>
<font color="yellow">Who wants fish and chips?</font>

94
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:24,570
BOTH: Me!

95
00:04:24,609 --> 00:04:26,010
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

96
00:04:26,049 --> 00:04:27,530
I can't get her to pick
up the phone.

97
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:28,970
She's not replying to messages.

98
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:32,289
She's just totally blocking me.

99
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:35,450
<font color="yellow">Helen, she's fine, I promise you.</font>
<font color="yellow">Just give her a bit of space.</font>

100
00:04:35,489 --> 00:04:37,489
Back off from my own daughter?

101
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:40,929
You don't know what it's like.
She's never been away from home

102
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:43,249
for longer than a night at a time
since she was born.

103
00:04:43,289 --> 00:04:45,090
<font color="yellow">Helen, she's 17, not seven.</font>

104
00:04:45,129 --> 00:04:46,609
<font color="yellow">It's only for a few days.</font>

105
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:50,450
'But...'
<font color="yellow">If you just leave her be,</font>

106
00:04:50,489 --> 00:04:52,249
<font color="yellow">she'll be back home</font>
<font color="yellow">by the end of the week.</font>

107
00:04:52,289 --> 00:04:54,570
<font color="yellow">'We've actually had</font>
<font color="yellow">some really good, long chats.'</font>

108
00:04:54,609 --> 00:04:57,169
<font color="yellow">I mean, she's worried about you</font>
<font color="yellow">and George, obviously.</font>

109
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:58,850
<font color="yellow">How's it going?</font>

110
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:00,689
Well, he's gone quiet.

111
00:05:00,729 --> 00:05:02,850
Totally. He won't talk to me.

112
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:04,729
<font color="yellow">'Have you told Mum?'</font>
No, no.

113
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:06,609
I don't want her to worry.

114
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:08,609
Don't say anything.
Or to Jake.

115
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:10,809
Not yet.
Just let me sort it.

116
00:05:14,049 --> 00:05:16,609
Er, Nats, I'll call you later, OK?

117
00:05:20,809 --> 00:05:22,369
What?

118
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:25,289
<font color="yellow">So, I'm going to go.</font>

119
00:05:26,809 --> 00:05:28,530
<font color="yellow">Er, I need to think.</font>

120
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:34,010
So, you're going to her,
to be with her? <font color="yellow">No.</font>

121
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:37,609
<font color="yellow">No. Cos I've told you,</font>
<font color="yellow">I don't even know who she is.</font>

122
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:40,450
Why would a woman say she was
sleeping with you when she wasn't?

123
00:05:40,489 --> 00:05:42,010
<font color="yellow">We've been over this.</font>

124
00:05:42,049 --> 00:05:43,450
Is she pretty?

125
00:05:43,489 --> 00:05:44,890
Blonde?
<font color="yellow">Helen, for God's sake.</font>

126
00:05:44,929 --> 00:05:46,369
Younger than me?
<font color="yellow">Yes, actually,</font>

127
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:47,410
<font color="yellow">she is younger than you.</font>

128
00:05:48,729 --> 00:05:50,450
<font color="yellow">She's Indian.</font>
<font color="yellow">Very pretty.</font>

129
00:05:50,489 --> 00:05:52,249
<font color="yellow">Used to work for the NHS.</font>

130
00:05:52,289 --> 00:05:53,809
<font color="yellow">Are you happy?</font>

131
00:05:54,809 --> 00:05:56,090
Shit...

132
00:05:57,129 --> 00:05:58,249
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

133
00:06:01,289 --> 00:06:02,650
It's Meera.

134
00:06:02,689 --> 00:06:04,249
<font color="yellow">Who the fuck is Meera?</font>

135
00:06:05,249 --> 00:06:07,210
God, I'm not having this.
She...

136
00:06:07,249 --> 00:06:08,570
She can't do this.

137
00:06:08,609 --> 00:06:09,929
Christ.

138
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:12,210
I'm going to get on to HR.

139
00:06:12,249 --> 00:06:14,410
This is all some kind
of revenge thing.

140
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:15,970
Of course you're not sleeping
with her.

141
00:06:17,049 --> 00:06:18,210
<font color="yellow">What if I had?</font>

142
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:21,489
<font color="yellow">Part of me really wanted to.</font>
Yeah, but you didn't.

143
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:22,729
That's the point.

144
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:24,450
Look, I believe you now.

145
00:06:24,489 --> 00:06:25,770
Totally.

146
00:06:25,809 --> 00:06:27,609
RINGING TONE
Oh, come on.

147
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:30,049
<font color="yellow">Helen, this doesn't actually</font>
<font color="yellow">change anything.</font>

148
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:31,650
Come on, come on, pick up.

149
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:33,650
I've spoken to my sister.

150
00:06:33,689 --> 00:06:35,249
She said I can stay there
for a few days.

151
00:06:35,289 --> 00:06:36,929
<font color="yellow">No. There's no need now.</font>

152
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:38,010
Yeah.

153
00:06:38,049 --> 00:06:39,210
Yes, there is.

154
00:06:39,249 --> 00:06:40,890
HE WALKS AWAY

155
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:44,289
<font color="yellow">George...?</font>

156
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:45,850
FRONT DOOR SLAMS

157
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:48,169
RINGING TONE CONTINUES

158
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:55,210
I reckon it's a boy.

159
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:56,369
Do you?

160
00:07:00,489 --> 00:07:02,970
Do you think he was conceived here
in this flat?

161
00:07:05,169 --> 00:07:06,530
<font color="yellow">Maybe.</font>

162
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:11,090
<font color="yellow">Do you still love her?</font>

163
00:07:11,129 --> 00:07:12,330
<font color="yellow">Carla.</font>

164
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:14,850
HE SIGHS

165
00:07:16,289 --> 00:07:18,249
For Christ's sake, Nats.

166
00:07:18,289 --> 00:07:19,729
I love you.

167
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:22,129
All right?

168
00:07:22,169 --> 00:07:23,609
You.

169
00:07:25,289 --> 00:07:26,289
I've got to go.

170
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:29,609
I can't do Monday.

171
00:07:30,809 --> 00:07:32,489
I promised I'd take the girls out.

172
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:33,770
Maybe Friday.

173
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:37,689
Leave it with me.

174
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:48,489
DOOR CLOSES

175
00:07:53,489 --> 00:07:57,689
<font color="yellow">And how did you feel about your</font>
<font color="yellow">mother's marriage to Mark Kinneally?</font>

176
00:07:57,729 --> 00:08:00,970
Er, it's not really any
of my business, is it?

177
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:03,530
If she was happy, I was happy.

178
00:08:05,129 --> 00:08:07,850
<font color="yellow">So, you weren't concerned</font>
<font color="yellow">that she had placed so much trust</font>

179
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:10,090
<font color="yellow">in someone she hadn't known</font>
<font color="yellow">very long?</font>

180
00:08:10,129 --> 00:08:11,289
No.

181
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:12,729
'Not really.'

182
00:08:14,289 --> 00:08:16,689
I went to a car dealership today.

183
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:21,249
I had a look at one of those MGs
that matey boy bought for Mum.

184
00:08:21,289 --> 00:08:23,689
Nine and a half grand.

185
00:08:23,729 --> 00:08:25,890
<font color="yellow">That is some birthday present.</font>
Yeah.

186
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:30,450
I was thinking, you could just bung
most of that on a credit card.

187
00:08:30,489 --> 00:08:33,769
Then, if something happens,
say the car burnt down,

188
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:35,970
for example, by kids or vandals,

189
00:08:36,009 --> 00:08:38,170
you could just claim it back on
insurance.

190
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:42,889
And then you still get to act like
the big hero.

191
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:45,850
"Stand back, everyone!"

192
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:48,810
You know, that sort of shit.

193
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:51,529
<font color="yellow">You actually think he set fire</font>
<font color="yellow">to it himself?</font>

194
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:53,330
It's possible, isn't it?

195
00:08:53,369 --> 00:08:55,489
<font color="yellow">Well, possible. But probable?</font>

196
00:09:05,369 --> 00:09:07,170
Have you got to go back
to the office?

197
00:09:08,369 --> 00:09:10,529
<font color="yellow">I thought we were square this month.</font>

198
00:09:12,889 --> 00:09:14,249
On the house.

199
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:17,409
<font color="yellow">OK.</font>

200
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:23,290
VIVIEN: Thanks for organising this.

201
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:26,609
Oh, I'd forgotten what a blissful
spot it is for a picnic.

202
00:09:28,409 --> 00:09:29,729
Ah...

203
00:09:30,769 --> 00:09:32,649
Look at the sea!
Isn't it glorious?

204
00:09:36,529 --> 00:09:39,970
<font color="yellow">I thought of it because of</font>
<font color="yellow">the hospital appointment tomorrow.</font>

205
00:09:40,009 --> 00:09:43,009
<font color="yellow">I know you're worried about it,</font>
<font color="yellow">so...</font>

206
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:44,850
You think it might be bad news?

207
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:48,729
<font color="yellow">Well, in my professional opinion...</font>

208
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:51,529
<font color="yellow">..absolutely not.</font>

209
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:53,570
THEY GIGGLE

210
00:09:57,249 --> 00:09:59,369
I'm going to cook supper tonight.

211
00:09:59,409 --> 00:10:01,850
You're always making supper for me.
Hm?

212
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:05,889
So, drop me off in town,
and I'll, erm...

213
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:09,409
..I'll pick something up
and surprise you.

214
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:10,769
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

215
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:12,529
I can cook, you know?

216
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,129
HE CHUCKLES

217
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:16,810
It might only be three things,
but I do them...

218
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:18,769
<font color="yellow">Come on!</font>
..extremely well.

219
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:20,810
<font color="yellow">I'll race you to the top!</font>
<font color="yellow">Come on!</font>

220
00:10:26,249 --> 00:10:27,529
<font color="yellow">You know...</font>

221
00:10:29,409 --> 00:10:32,450
<font color="yellow">..over the past five years,</font>
<font color="yellow">I've dated a lot of women.</font>

222
00:10:32,489 --> 00:10:34,609
<font color="yellow">But you've shone out.</font>

223
00:10:35,609 --> 00:10:37,450
<font color="yellow">You're so generous and...</font>

224
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:39,649
<font color="yellow">..thoughtful...</font>

225
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:41,409
<font color="yellow">and gorgeous.</font>

226
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:47,649
<font color="yellow">I knew, from the end</font>
<font color="yellow">of that first cup of coffee, I knew.</font>

227
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:50,729
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

228
00:10:50,769 --> 00:10:52,889
<font color="yellow">..even if it's bad news tomorrow...</font>

229
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:57,529
<font color="yellow">I'm not going anywhere, Viv.</font>

230
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:03,649
Oh, Mark, thank you.

231
00:12:00,769 --> 00:12:02,009
<font color="yellow">Yoo-hoo!</font>

232
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:04,930
<font color="yellow">Vivien!</font>

233
00:12:10,649 --> 00:12:14,170
SHOWER RUNS

234
00:13:11,525 --> 00:13:13,325
KNOCK ON DOOR

235
00:13:13,364 --> 00:13:14,685
<font color="yellow">Hi.</font>

236
00:13:14,724 --> 00:13:17,084
<font color="yellow">I got your message about Meera</font>
<font color="yellow">Kapoor.</font>

237
00:13:17,124 --> 00:13:18,765
<font color="yellow">I'm so sorry, Helen.</font>

238
00:13:18,805 --> 00:13:20,724
So, what are we going to do?

239
00:13:20,765 --> 00:13:23,724
I mean, she's no longer an employee.
It's a police matter now, isn't it?

240
00:13:23,765 --> 00:13:24,964
<font color="yellow">Well, hold on a minute,</font>

241
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:27,165
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure that this is really</font>
<font color="yellow">a criminal offence.</font>

242
00:13:27,204 --> 00:13:28,484
What?

243
00:13:28,525 --> 00:13:31,165
It must be an invasion of privacy.
I mean...

244
00:13:31,204 --> 00:13:32,445
Or some bloody thing.

245
00:13:32,484 --> 00:13:34,244
She can't just fuck
with people's lives.

246
00:13:34,285 --> 00:13:36,445
<font color="yellow">I would just advise</font>
<font color="yellow">that we take a moment</font>

247
00:13:36,484 --> 00:13:38,204
<font color="yellow">to think calmly, Helen.</font>

248
00:13:38,244 --> 00:13:40,645
You wouldn't be calm
if it was your family at stake.

249
00:13:40,685 --> 00:13:43,645
<font color="yellow">Well, do you really want to go</font>
<font color="yellow">public with something like this?</font>

250
00:13:45,004 --> 00:13:46,925
<font color="yellow">I think this will be the end of it.</font>

251
00:13:49,204 --> 00:13:50,765
<font color="yellow">And anyway...</font>

252
00:13:50,805 --> 00:13:52,805
<font color="yellow">what's the most important thing</font>
<font color="yellow">here?</font>

253
00:13:54,445 --> 00:13:56,645
<font color="yellow">It's not to punish Meera, is it?</font>

254
00:13:58,244 --> 00:14:00,925
<font color="yellow">But to put your family back</font>
<font color="yellow">together.</font>

255
00:14:00,964 --> 00:14:02,405
<font color="yellow">Go home.</font>

256
00:14:03,765 --> 00:14:05,325
<font color="yellow">Take the rest of the week off.</font>

257
00:14:06,604 --> 00:14:08,285
<font color="yellow">Get your life back.</font>

DOOR CLOSES

259
00:14:22,925 --> 00:14:24,685
MARY: <font color="yellow">Yoo-hoo!</font>
HE GROANS

260
00:14:24,724 --> 00:14:26,204
VIVIEN: Hello, Mary!

261
00:14:27,525 --> 00:14:28,925
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

262
00:14:28,964 --> 00:14:32,045
<font color="yellow">I just wondered how you got on</font>
<font color="yellow">at the hospital?</font>

263
00:14:32,084 --> 00:14:33,604
Oh, good, fine.

264
00:14:33,645 --> 00:14:35,165
Clean bill of health.

265
00:14:35,204 --> 00:14:36,685
<font color="yellow">Oh, thank God.</font>

266
00:14:36,724 --> 00:14:38,484
<font color="yellow">So, what was it, then?</font>

267
00:14:39,604 --> 00:14:42,004
Oh, a sudden drop in blood pressure,
apparently.

268
00:14:42,045 --> 00:14:43,364
Not uncommon.

269
00:14:43,405 --> 00:14:46,124
<font color="yellow">We'll just have to hope</font>
<font color="yellow">it doesn't happen again, then.</font>

270
00:14:46,165 --> 00:14:48,724
<font color="yellow">Oh, I got you this.</font>

271
00:14:48,765 --> 00:14:52,724
<font color="yellow">I found it down the back</font>
<font color="yellow">of the sideboard the other day.</font>

272
00:14:54,045 --> 00:14:55,604
Aw...!

273
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:58,285
Natalie's imaginary cat.

274
00:14:58,325 --> 00:15:01,325
<font color="yellow">Yes, Ginger. She was always</font>
<font color="yellow">doing pictures of him, wasn't she?</font>

275
00:15:01,364 --> 00:15:03,364
<font color="yellow">Such a vivid imagination.</font>
Mm.

276
00:15:03,405 --> 00:15:06,805
Oh, can I hang on to it?
I'm sure she'd love to see it.

277
00:15:06,844 --> 00:15:08,204
<font color="yellow">Yes, yes, no, keep it.</font>

278
00:15:08,244 --> 00:15:10,084
<font color="yellow">She can pass it on</font>
<font color="yellow">to her own kids one day.</font>

279
00:15:10,124 --> 00:15:11,325
Well, I wish.

280
00:15:11,364 --> 00:15:13,124
<font color="yellow">Oh, don't worry,</font>
<font color="yellow">she'll find someone.</font>

281
00:15:13,165 --> 00:15:15,645
<font color="yellow">She's still got time.</font>
<font color="yellow">She'd make a lovely mum.</font>

282
00:15:15,685 --> 00:15:16,805
She would.

283
00:15:20,765 --> 00:15:22,685
<font color="yellow">Are they all OK?</font>

284
00:15:23,724 --> 00:15:24,724
I, er...

285
00:15:25,805 --> 00:15:27,565
Yeah.
I think so.

286
00:15:27,604 --> 00:15:29,964
<font color="yellow">Well, of course you worry.</font>
<font color="yellow">It's only natural.</font>

287
00:15:30,004 --> 00:15:31,884
<font color="yellow">But they'll come round.</font>
<font color="yellow">Give them time.</font>

288
00:15:32,884 --> 00:15:35,124
<font color="yellow">Anyway, I won't keep you.</font>

289
00:15:35,165 --> 00:15:37,285
<font color="yellow">Are these bags for the charity shop?</font>

290
00:15:37,325 --> 00:15:39,525
Oh, yes, I meant to take them
and I...

291
00:15:39,565 --> 00:15:42,325
<font color="yellow">I can take them down there cos I'm</font>
<font color="yellow">going there later. It's no trouble.</font>

292
00:15:42,364 --> 00:15:43,925
Oh, thanks.
<font color="yellow">OK.</font>

293
00:15:43,964 --> 00:15:46,084
<font color="yellow">All right, I'll see you later, then.</font>

294
00:15:46,124 --> 00:15:47,604
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

295
00:15:47,645 --> 00:15:49,285
<font color="yellow">Bye, Mark.</font>

296
00:15:54,604 --> 00:15:56,805
<font color="cyan">She's always popping over,</font>
<font color="cyan">isn't she?</font>

297
00:15:56,844 --> 00:15:58,484
Well, I don't mind.

298
00:15:58,525 --> 00:16:00,045
<font color="cyan">I would.</font>

299
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:02,685
She was great with the kids
when they were young.

300
00:16:02,724 --> 00:16:04,884
She kept an eye on them
for me after school.

301
00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:08,405
I tell you, she helped me a lot.

302
00:16:12,364 --> 00:16:14,285
STELLA: <font color="yellow">And then I think</font>
<font color="yellow">we should end...</font>

303
00:16:14,325 --> 00:16:18,525
<font color="yellow">I understand that,</font>
<font color="yellow">while we're both separated...</font>

304
00:16:19,525 --> 00:16:21,925
<font color="yellow">..it is none of my business</font>
<font color="yellow">who you choose to see.</font>

305
00:16:21,964 --> 00:16:23,844
"..it is none of my..."
What?

306
00:16:23,884 --> 00:16:26,204
<font color="yellow">No, she'll appreciate that.</font>
<font color="yellow">Trust me.</font>

307
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:31,364
<font color="yellow">But that doesn't mean I don't care.</font>

308
00:16:32,405 --> 00:16:33,844
<font color="yellow">I do.</font>

309
00:16:33,884 --> 00:16:36,525
<font color="yellow">And I hope, with all my heart...</font>

310
00:16:36,565 --> 00:16:38,765
"..with all my heart"?
I wouldn't say that.

311
00:16:39,884 --> 00:16:43,604
<font color="yellow">I hope, with all my heart, that we</font>
<font color="yellow">can put our marriage back together.</font>

312
00:16:43,645 --> 00:16:45,765
"..marriage back together."

313
00:16:45,805 --> 00:16:47,244
Er... "..heart."

314
00:16:47,285 --> 00:16:48,925
OK, that's good.
That's really good.

315
00:16:48,964 --> 00:16:50,285
<font color="yellow">I love you.</font>

316
00:16:50,325 --> 00:16:51,685
Hang on, hang on.

317
00:16:52,844 --> 00:16:54,685
"..back together."
What was that?

318
00:16:54,724 --> 00:16:55,964
<font color="yellow">I love you.</font>

319
00:16:56,004 --> 00:16:57,325
"I love you."

320
00:16:57,364 --> 00:16:58,565
<font color="yellow">Jake.</font>

321
00:16:58,604 --> 00:16:59,925
"Jake."

322
00:16:59,964 --> 00:17:01,525
Kiss, kiss, kiss?

323
00:17:01,565 --> 00:17:03,525
<font color="yellow">Er...</font>
Two kisses?

324
00:17:04,765 --> 00:17:06,124
Three kisses.

325
00:17:06,164 --> 00:17:08,525
Well, that's good.
That's brilliant. That's genius.

326
00:17:08,565 --> 00:17:10,164
<font color="yellow">OK, I've got to get back</font>
<font color="yellow">to the office.</font>

327
00:17:10,205 --> 00:17:11,884
Thank you so much.
Thank you, thank you,

328
00:17:11,924 --> 00:17:13,325
thank you, thank you, thank you.

329
00:17:13,364 --> 00:17:14,765
Thank you, thank you.

330
00:17:30,805 --> 00:17:32,205
What are you doing here?

331
00:17:32,245 --> 00:17:34,084
<font color="yellow">You're...?</font>
You're moving?

332
00:17:34,124 --> 00:17:35,644
<font color="yellow">Yeah, that's right.</font>

333
00:17:35,684 --> 00:17:37,965
<font color="yellow">I can't afford the rent,</font>
<font color="yellow">now I'm unemployed.</font>

334
00:17:38,005 --> 00:17:41,005
<font color="yellow">So, I have to uproot my girls.</font>

335
00:17:41,045 --> 00:17:43,205
<font color="yellow">And they were just getting over</font>
<font color="yellow">losing their dad.</font>

336
00:17:43,245 --> 00:17:44,924
So, you're...

337
00:17:44,965 --> 00:17:46,444
You got me back.

338
00:17:46,485 --> 00:17:48,325
An eye for an eye, is that it?

339
00:17:49,364 --> 00:17:51,525
<font color="yellow">Just leave us in peace, will you?</font>

340
00:17:59,965 --> 00:18:03,404
INSPECTOR: <font color="yellow">I understand your mother</font>
<font color="yellow">had always enjoyed good health.</font>

341
00:18:03,444 --> 00:18:06,924
Mum always kept herself fit
as a fiddle.

342
00:18:06,965 --> 00:18:08,525
<font color="yellow">So her collapse...</font>

343
00:18:09,884 --> 00:18:12,084
<font color="yellow">..I mean, that must have come</font>
<font color="yellow">as a shock.</font>

344
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:13,525
Yeah, it did.

345
00:18:13,565 --> 00:18:15,485
'She made every effort
to get better,

346
00:18:15,525 --> 00:18:16,765
but it wasn't like her.

347
00:18:16,805 --> 00:18:19,725
'So, yes, of course we were
concerned.'

348
00:18:21,565 --> 00:18:22,725
Great.

349
00:18:22,765 --> 00:18:24,404
Have you got it?
<font color="yellow">Mm-hm.</font>

350
00:18:26,364 --> 00:18:27,485
Good.

351
00:18:30,684 --> 00:18:31,725
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

352
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:35,525
<font color="yellow">How are things with you and Leila?</font>

353
00:18:35,565 --> 00:18:37,684
Yeah, it's up and down, Mum.

354
00:18:38,965 --> 00:18:42,485
But I've started talking to someone.
That's made a bit of a difference.

355
00:18:42,525 --> 00:18:44,285
<font color="yellow">A therapist?</font>
Er, yeah.

356
00:18:44,325 --> 00:18:45,725
Yeah, sort of.

357
00:18:45,765 --> 00:18:47,124
Yeah.

358
00:18:47,164 --> 00:18:48,245
<font color="yellow">Oh, great.</font>

359
00:18:48,285 --> 00:18:50,884
Yeah, she's making me see things
from a different point of view.

360
00:18:50,924 --> 00:18:52,805
You know, from a woman's point
of view.

361
00:18:52,844 --> 00:18:54,604
<font color="yellow">Oh, Jake, that's amazing.</font>

362
00:18:56,124 --> 00:18:57,604
Well, you know...

363
00:19:00,565 --> 00:19:02,565
How are things going with Mark?

364
00:19:04,164 --> 00:19:05,485
<font color="yellow">Look...</font>

365
00:19:05,525 --> 00:19:08,404
<font color="yellow">I know that things have happened,</font>
<font color="yellow">you know...</font>

366
00:19:08,444 --> 00:19:10,364
<font color="yellow">..really quickly,</font>
<font color="yellow">from your point of view.</font>

367
00:19:13,565 --> 00:19:15,924
<font color="yellow">I didn't plan this, though.</font>

368
00:19:17,765 --> 00:19:20,124
Yeah, I know, I know.
Of course.

369
00:19:20,164 --> 00:19:21,565
Yeah.

370
00:19:27,285 --> 00:19:31,124
What's his daughter's name,
the one who lives in Spain?

371
00:19:31,164 --> 00:19:32,884
<font color="yellow">Sophie.</font>
Sophie, yeah.

372
00:19:34,485 --> 00:19:37,045
Have you spoken to her?
I mean, in person.

373
00:19:37,084 --> 00:19:38,164
<font color="yellow">No, why would I?</font>

374
00:19:38,205 --> 00:19:40,604
Well, I don't know.
I just thought...

375
00:19:40,644 --> 00:19:42,565
I mean, have you seen a photograph
of her or...?

376
00:19:42,604 --> 00:19:44,884
<font color="yellow">Oh, Jake, for God's sake.</font>

377
00:19:44,924 --> 00:19:47,364
<font color="yellow">Stop being so suspicious.</font>

378
00:19:49,844 --> 00:19:51,725
<font color="yellow">I can look after myself, you know?</font>

379
00:19:51,765 --> 00:19:54,644
Yeah, I know, Mum.
But I'm just worried about you.

380
00:21:44,765 --> 00:21:46,205
Aw...!

381
00:21:54,245 --> 00:21:55,725
Right.

382
00:22:13,285 --> 00:22:16,884
MARK: <font color="yellow">This trip to India</font>
<font color="yellow">is going to be wonderful.</font>

383
00:22:16,924 --> 00:22:18,485
<font color="yellow">Have you looked at it?</font>

384
00:22:18,525 --> 00:22:21,005
<font color="yellow">I mean, it's sensational stuff.</font>

385
00:22:21,045 --> 00:22:23,364
<font color="yellow">Shall I talk you</font>
<font color="yellow">through the itinerary?</font>

386
00:22:23,404 --> 00:22:25,525
Can we do it tomorrow?

387
00:22:25,565 --> 00:22:27,245
<font color="yellow">Yeah, of course, of course.</font>

388
00:22:28,404 --> 00:22:30,684
<font color="yellow">Are you all right?</font>
Yeah. Yes, I'm fine.

389
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:33,565
Just thinking about the kids.

390
00:22:34,725 --> 00:22:36,325
It's funny, you know...

391
00:22:36,364 --> 00:22:39,565
..I have never gone away anywhere
for six weeks before.

392
00:22:39,604 --> 00:22:41,965
And now, it suddenly seems
a long time.

393
00:22:42,005 --> 00:22:43,485
THEY CHUCKLE

394
00:22:43,525 --> 00:22:46,084
<font color="yellow">I think they'll manage all right on</font>
<font color="yellow">their own.</font>

395
00:22:46,124 --> 00:22:47,364
<font color="yellow">Hm?</font>

396
00:22:47,404 --> 00:22:48,965
Yeah, I know.

397
00:22:49,005 --> 00:22:52,005
I know. But you can't stop
worrying about them, can you?

398
00:22:53,565 --> 00:22:55,084
I had a...

399
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:56,965
..a bit of a chat to Jake today
and...

400
00:22:58,124 --> 00:23:00,924
..I haven't talked to the girls,
not properly, for ages.

401
00:23:02,805 --> 00:23:05,005
Something doesn't seem quite right
about them.

402
00:23:06,164 --> 00:23:08,285
<font color="yellow">There's always going to be...</font>

403
00:23:08,325 --> 00:23:12,525
<font color="yellow">..some drama or other going on,</font>
<font color="yellow">isn't there?</font>

404
00:23:12,565 --> 00:23:14,005
Mm.

405
00:23:14,045 --> 00:23:15,965
<font color="yellow">Try not to worry about it.</font>

406
00:23:17,045 --> 00:23:19,525
Don't you worry about your daughter?

407
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:22,164
<font color="yellow">No, not really.</font>
<font color="yellow">She's a very capable woman.</font>

408
00:23:24,205 --> 00:23:26,084
Do you have a photo of her?

409
00:23:27,285 --> 00:23:29,045
<font color="yellow">Not in this new phone, no.</font>

410
00:23:29,084 --> 00:23:31,285
<font color="yellow">I couldn't work out</font>
<font color="yellow">how to transfer the photos across.</font>

411
00:23:32,325 --> 00:23:33,684
<font color="yellow">Hopeless.</font>

412
00:23:35,765 --> 00:23:37,604
<font color="yellow">Come here to me.</font>

413
00:23:52,245 --> 00:23:53,485
Hm.

414
00:24:02,444 --> 00:24:06,285
SEA BIRDS CRY

415
00:24:06,325 --> 00:24:09,965
LEILA: <font color="yellow">That letter must have taken</font>
<font color="yellow">you ages.</font>

416
00:24:10,005 --> 00:24:13,404
<font color="yellow">I know how much you hate writing,</font>
<font color="yellow">so I was really touched.</font>

417
00:24:13,444 --> 00:24:15,005
<font color="yellow">Thanks.</font>

418
00:24:15,045 --> 00:24:17,884
<font color="yellow">And listen, you know,</font>
<font color="yellow">about that guy.</font>

419
00:24:17,924 --> 00:24:19,725
<font color="yellow">I've seen him twice.</font>

420
00:24:19,765 --> 00:24:22,924
Mm-hm.
<font color="yellow">But, well, erm...</font>

421
00:24:22,965 --> 00:24:26,805
<font color="yellow">..twice is enough, shall we say?</font>

422
00:24:26,844 --> 00:24:31,005
<font color="yellow">He's a lovely bloke, but, erm...</font>

423
00:24:31,045 --> 00:24:34,805
<font color="yellow">..he has breath issues.</font>

424
00:24:34,844 --> 00:24:36,245
Sorry.

425
00:24:36,285 --> 00:24:38,084
<font color="yellow">I couldn't quite imagine</font>
<font color="yellow">kissing him.</font>

426
00:24:38,124 --> 00:24:40,245
I'm sorry. Sorry.

427
00:24:40,285 --> 00:24:42,245
HE CHUCKLES

428
00:24:44,404 --> 00:24:47,924
<font color="yellow">You seem a lot calmer, these days.</font>
Do I?

429
00:24:47,965 --> 00:24:50,604
Well, I am.

430
00:24:50,644 --> 00:24:51,965
I've been...

431
00:24:52,005 --> 00:24:54,404
..seeing this therapist
sort of a person.

432
00:24:54,444 --> 00:24:56,565
It's helped me a lot, actually.

433
00:24:56,604 --> 00:24:59,164
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>
Yeah.

434
00:24:59,205 --> 00:25:01,965
And I've stopped drinking.

435
00:25:03,364 --> 00:25:05,644
It makes a difference.

436
00:25:05,684 --> 00:25:07,565
Jake, that's, erm...

437

Yeah, it's... I feel like...

439
00:25:13,285 --> 00:25:15,444
Well, I mean, I know it's early days

440
00:25:15,485 --> 00:25:19,164
and I've got a long, long way to go,
but, er...

441
00:25:19,205 --> 00:25:21,844
..yeah, I do,
I feel like a different man.

What's all this, then?

This must be...

Vivien being ill,

461
00:26:49,245 --> 00:26:50,725
the kids being so hard on you,

462
00:26:50,765 --> 00:26:52,924
feeling you're stealing
their mum away.

463
00:26:52,965 --> 00:26:54,844
You mustn't mind what they think.

Hi.

Look...

472
00:27:49,805 --> 00:27:52,565
I know I haven't been a good mum
to you recently.

473
00:27:54,205 --> 00:27:55,525
I'm sorry.

474
00:27:58,285 --> 00:28:01,124
But this new job...

475
00:28:01,164 --> 00:28:03,444
..has been hard.

476
00:28:04,565 --> 00:28:06,164
<font color="yellow">So was the last one.</font>

477

Yeah.

478
00:28:12,045 --> 00:28:13,725
The thing is, I...

479
00:28:13,765 --> 00:28:17,005
..I really care about the job I do.

480
00:28:18,485 --> 00:28:21,684
You know, it's taken me years...

481
00:28:21,725 --> 00:28:24,325
..to get where I am.

482
00:28:24,364 --> 00:28:27,965
And now, finally,
I'm in a position...

483
00:28:28,005 --> 00:28:34,245
..where my experience can hopefully
make these hospitals work better.

484
00:28:35,404 --> 00:28:36,684
But...

485
00:28:38,485 --> 00:28:42,684
..my job is not more important
than you.

486
00:28:46,245 --> 00:28:48,364
Darling, please come home.

487
00:29:00,844 --> 00:29:02,525
<font color="yellow">What's going on, Nats?</font>

488
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:07,805
<font color="yellow">It's the baby, isn't it?</font>

489
00:29:07,844 --> 00:29:09,245
<font color="yellow">What happened at the doctor's?</font>

490
00:29:09,285 --> 00:29:12,325
I haven't been to the doctor's.

491
00:29:12,364 --> 00:29:13,844
<font color="yellow">Well, why not?</font>

492
00:29:16,005 --> 00:29:17,604
Because I'm not pregnant.

493
00:29:19,205 --> 00:29:20,924
I was never pregnant.

494
00:29:20,965 --> 00:29:22,485
I lied to you.

495
00:29:24,644 --> 00:29:26,364
I know, it's beyond the pale.

496
00:29:26,404 --> 00:29:28,045
It's horrendous.

497
00:29:29,164 --> 00:29:30,844
You see, I, er...

498
00:29:31,965 --> 00:29:34,525
I came off the pill
on New Year's Day

499
00:29:34,565 --> 00:29:37,644
and I just thought I'd get pregnant
straightaway

500
00:29:37,684 --> 00:29:40,164
and you would finally leave Carla.

501
00:29:41,765 --> 00:29:45,005
And I kept thinking
that I was pregnant

502
00:29:45,045 --> 00:29:47,005
and I kept hoping,
I was really high every month.

503
00:29:47,045 --> 00:29:48,404
But I wasn't.

504
00:29:51,644 --> 00:29:53,045
Because, you see, five years

505
00:29:53,084 --> 00:29:55,245
is just a hell of a long time to
live your life

506
00:29:55,285 --> 00:29:58,205
as if the most important thing
in it, you, doesn't exist.

507
00:29:59,245 --> 00:30:00,725
And...

508
00:30:00,765 --> 00:30:02,525
it made me crazy.

509
00:30:02,565 --> 00:30:05,725
The secrecy and the sneaking around.

510
00:30:08,084 --> 00:30:12,325
It made me the kind of person
who lies to literally everyone.

511
00:30:14,884 --> 00:30:16,245
And...

512
00:30:16,285 --> 00:30:17,965
I can't take it any more.

513
00:30:20,725 --> 00:30:23,604
I'm sorry, I love you,
but I can't go on like this.

514
00:30:25,084 --> 00:30:26,485
I'm sorry.

She... came to a couple

00:44:28,055 --> 00:44:30,375
JAKE: Er, good, good.

735
00:44:30,415 --> 00:44:32,375
We were all there to make an effort
for her.

736
00:44:33,654 --> 00:44:35,254
NATALIE:
<font color="cyan">Welcome to the most awkward</font>

737
00:44:35,294 --> 00:44:37,455
<font color="cyan">birthday drinks</font>
<font color="cyan">in the history of the world.</font>

738
00:44:37,495 --> 00:44:38,895
Yeah, it's not funny, though, is it?

739
00:44:38,935 --> 00:44:40,455
<font color="yellow">Have you been drinking?</font>

740
00:44:40,495 --> 00:44:42,214
Why, have you?

741
00:44:42,254 --> 00:44:44,415
INSPECTOR:
<font color="yellow">There were no arguments or rows?</font>

742
00:44:45,294 --> 00:44:47,895
No, everyone was having a good time.

743
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:50,055
<font color="yellow">So, here's to you, Vivien.</font>

744
00:44:50,094 --> 00:44:52,294
Yes, happy birthday to the best mum.

745
00:44:52,335 --> 00:44:53,415
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

746
00:44:53,455 --> 00:44:55,055
Here's to you, Viv.

747
00:44:55,094 --> 00:44:57,254
INSPECTOR:
<font color="yellow">And when it all went wrong...</font>

748
00:44:57,294 --> 00:44:59,455
<font color="yellow">..did you try to help the victim</font>
<font color="yellow">in any way?</font>

749
00:45:00,814 --> 00:45:02,535
Yeah, of course I tried.

750
00:45:02,575 --> 00:45:05,254
Of course I tried.
It just happened really quickly.

751
00:45:05,294 --> 00:45:06,654
We were all in shock, weren't we?

752
00:45:08,495 --> 00:45:10,134
<font color="yellow">What happened to your hand?</font>

753
00:45:11,214 --> 00:45:12,734
Er...

754
00:45:12,774 --> 00:45:14,375
Shit, I don't know.

755
00:45:14,415 --> 00:45:15,694
I just...

756
00:45:15,734 --> 00:45:17,214
I don't know, I don't know.

757
00:45:17,254 --> 00:45:19,495
I just must have banged it
on something.

758
00:45:19,535 --> 00:45:20,855
<font color="cyan">Urgh!</font>

759
00:45:22,654 --> 00:45:23,774
<font color="yellow">Hmm.</font>

759
00:45:24,305 --> 00:46:24,728
