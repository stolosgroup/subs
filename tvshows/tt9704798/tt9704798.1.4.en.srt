{\an8}INSPECTOR: <font color="yellow">'Were there any</font>
<font color="yellow">family feuds</font>

<font color="yellow">on what happened last night?'</font>

3
00:00:04,769 --> 00:00:07,210
I would love you to join us
for drinks on my birthday.

4
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:11,010
I know I said it was only family,
but of course you are family.

5
00:00:11,049 --> 00:00:12,730
<font color="yellow">Bring me the woman</font>
<font color="yellow">who sent this picture,</font>

6
00:00:12,769 --> 00:00:15,449
<font color="yellow">and let me hear her tell me</font>
<font color="yellow">that she's never slept with you.</font>

7
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:17,249
Significant resignations?

8
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:19,529
What about brutal dismissals?

9
00:00:19,569 --> 00:00:21,569
<font color="yellow">Do you still love Carla?</font>
For Christ's sake, Nat.

10
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:22,889
'I love you.'

11
00:00:22,929 --> 00:00:24,010
<font color="yellow">I'm not pregnant.</font>

12
00:00:24,049 --> 00:00:25,290
<font color="yellow">I lied to you.</font>

13
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:28,170
You seem a lot calmer these days.

14
00:00:28,209 --> 00:00:30,929
JAKE: <font color="yellow">'I'm seeing this therapist</font>
<font color="yellow">sort of a person.'</font>

15
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:32,289
<font color="yellow">I feel like a different man.</font>

16
00:00:32,329 --> 00:00:34,649
Mr and Mrs Kinneally?
I'm sorry to keep you.

17
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:39,009
On his wife's death certificate,
it says "cause of death overdose".

18
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:41,609
<font color="yellow">What's his daughter's name?</font>
<font color="yellow">The one who lives in Spain?</font>

19
00:00:41,649 --> 00:00:43,450
<font color="yellow">I mean, have you seen</font>
<font color="yellow">a photograph of her?</font>

20
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:45,929
Jake, stop being so suspicious.

21
00:00:45,969 --> 00:00:47,929
<font color="yellow">I'm not going anywhere.</font>

22
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:51,770
Mark and I, we've booked a six-week
trip to India for my birthday treat.

23
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:54,690
HELEN: <font color="yellow">But, Mum, you've just been</font>
<font color="yellow">in hospital.</font>

24
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:56,289
NATALIE: What if you have
another attack?

25
00:00:56,329 --> 00:00:57,569
<font color="yellow">This is dynamite.</font>

26
00:00:57,609 --> 00:01:01,810
"Doctor Kinneally stood to benefit
financially from his wife's death."

27
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:05,330
So she's implying
that he murdered his wife?

28
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,074

{\an8}HELEN: I suppose, as the eldest,
I felt a sense of responsibility,

30
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:38,649
{\an8}after Dad died,
to look after Mum.

31

{\an8}<font color="yellow">Did you feel that she had perhaps</font>
<font color="yellow">rushed into her new marriage?</font>

32
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:44,050
No.

33
00:01:44,089 --> 00:01:45,770
Not really.

34
00:01:45,809 --> 00:01:47,130
I mean, at that point...

35
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:50,490
Well, there was no way of knowing

36
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:52,770
that it would all end
in such a...

37
00:01:52,809 --> 00:01:54,610
..an appalling way.

38
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:09,609
PHONE BUZZES

39
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:15,250
Oh...

40
00:02:15,289 --> 00:02:17,850
I can't believe
I've slept this long.

41
00:02:17,889 --> 00:02:20,329
<font color="yellow">That's good.</font>
<font color="yellow">You clearly needed the rest.</font>

42
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:22,210
<font color="yellow">Just think,</font>
<font color="yellow">in a couple of days' time,</font>

43
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:24,410
<font color="yellow">we'll be looking out</font>
<font color="yellow">at the Indian Ocean.</font>

44
00:02:25,609 --> 00:02:29,049
Helen just texted and asked me over
this morning for a coffee.

45
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:30,370
She's off work.

46
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:32,169
<font color="yellow">Ill?</font>
No, no.

47
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:33,530
Just a chat.

48
00:02:33,569 --> 00:02:36,970
I think things aren't quite right
with her and George.

49
00:02:38,009 --> 00:02:39,690
<font color="yellow">Mum to the rescue.</font>

50
00:02:40,729 --> 00:02:42,410
Actually...

51
00:02:42,449 --> 00:02:44,569
she never asked for anything, Helen.

52
00:02:44,609 --> 00:02:48,090
Not help, advice, or money.
So, if she's reaching out, it's...

53
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:49,930
it's something.

54
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:52,650
<font color="yellow">OK, OK.</font>

55
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:57,489
<font color="yellow">Well, I think I'll just nip</font>
<font color="yellow">into town</font>

56
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:00,289
<font color="yellow">and pick up the rest of the holiday</font>
<font color="yellow">shopping, OK?</font>

57
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:19,009
So, we're going to try and keep it
as low-key, as calm as possible.

58
00:03:19,049 --> 00:03:21,530
We don't wanna upset her.
<font color="yellow">Well, she's going to be upset.</font>

59
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:23,769
Yeah, but if we keep calm, Jake...

60
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:25,370
<font color="cyan">Er, I'm calm!</font>

61
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:27,370
But make it clear we're here
to support her.

DOORBELL CHIMES

63
00:03:28,449 --> 00:03:30,569
OK. OK, good luck, everybody.

64
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:37,289
Hey, Mum!
Thanks for coming over.

65
00:03:37,329 --> 00:03:38,449
<font color="#008000">Hello.</font>

66
00:03:44,609 --> 00:03:46,250
JAKE: <font color="cyan">Hi.</font>
<font color="#008000">Hello!</font>

67
00:03:46,289 --> 00:03:48,449
NATALIE: <font color="yellow">Hey, Mum.</font>
<font color="#008000">What's going on?</font>

68
00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:50,690
<font color="#008000">I haven't forgotten someone's</font>
<font color="#008000">birthday, have I?</font>

69
00:03:50,729 --> 00:03:53,489
No, no. No.
<font color="#008000">Is everything OK?</font>

70
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:54,970
<font color="yellow">Kind of.</font>
Yes.

71
00:03:55,009 --> 00:03:57,009
<font color="cyan">It's not really, no.</font>
Do you want some coffee?

72
00:03:57,049 --> 00:03:59,729
<font color="#008000">Erm, no. No, no, no, no.</font>
<font color="#008000">Why are none of you at work?</font>

73
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:04,569
Look, as you know,

74
00:04:04,609 --> 00:04:08,009
we've been a bit worried about you,
about your health, and...

75
00:04:08,049 --> 00:04:10,930
and Mark.
<font color="#008000">Oh, no...</font>

76
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:13,370
<font color="#008000">Really?</font>
<font color="yellow">No, just hear us out, Mum, please.</font>

77
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:16,530
OK, so, look, we've been doing
a bit of research about Mark.

78
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:17,809
<font color="#008000">What?</font>

79
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:20,090
<font color="cyan">Just Googling,</font>
<font color="cyan">checking his background a bit.</font>

80
00:04:20,129 --> 00:04:23,049
And what we found out is...

81
00:04:24,169 --> 00:04:25,249
<font color="#008000">Well?</font>

82
00:04:25,289 --> 00:04:27,210
Well, it turns out his first wife...

83
00:04:28,489 --> 00:04:29,929
..she took her own life.

84
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,530
<font color="cyan">Yeah, she committed suicide, Mum.</font>

85
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:33,289
Which is not what he told us,
is it?

86
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:34,410
<font color="cyan">No.</font>

87
00:04:35,369 --> 00:04:37,609
There was an inquest, of course.

88
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:39,010
Erm...

89
00:04:39,049 --> 00:04:42,129
And there was some controversy
during it

90
00:04:42,169 --> 00:04:44,330
that he, Mark, had...

91
00:04:45,609 --> 00:04:47,450
..a hand in her death.

92
00:04:47,489 --> 00:04:49,489
<font color="cyan">Mum, you cannot go</font>
<font color="cyan">to India with him.</font>

93
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:51,330
<font color="yellow">It's a lot to take in.</font>
<font color="yellow">Just give her a minute.</font>

94
00:04:51,369 --> 00:04:52,729
<font color="cyan">I know, but it's just not safe.</font>

95
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:56,090
We would never forgive ourselves
if we didn't say anything to you.

96
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,369
<font color="yellow">It's just a bit much of a risk,</font>
<font color="yellow">don't you think, Mum?</font>

97
00:05:01,489 --> 00:05:03,330
<font color="#008000">I know all about this.</font>

98
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:09,890
<font color="#008000">He doesn't tell everyone</font>
<font color="#008000">that she committed suicide.</font>

99
00:05:09,929 --> 00:05:11,129
<font color="#008000">But he's told me.</font>

100
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,369
<font color="#008000">Of course he's told me.</font>

101
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:16,049
<font color="#008000">Ages ago.</font>

102
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:18,890
<font color="#008000">She suffered from depression.</font>

103
00:05:18,929 --> 00:05:21,369
<font color="#008000">And she was hospitalised</font>
<font color="#008000">several times.</font>

104
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:22,970
<font color="#008000">And...</font>

105
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:24,850
<font color="#008000">she tried to take her own life</font>

106
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:27,049
<font color="#008000">and he saved her.</font>

107
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:32,530
<font color="#008000">And then, when she finally</font>
<font color="#008000">succeeded...</font>

108
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:38,090
<font color="#008000">..the police questioned him</font>
<font color="#008000">as a routine thing.</font>

109
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:42,330
<font color="#008000">That does not mean</font>
<font color="#008000">that he had a hand in it.</font>

110
00:05:45,369 --> 00:05:46,850
<font color="#008000">He was mortified.</font>

111
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:49,570
Well, then, why all the fuss
at the inquest?

112
00:05:49,609 --> 00:05:51,530
<font color="cyan">This woman stood up in court</font>

113
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:54,210
<font color="cyan">and she said she wasn't depressed,</font>
<font color="cyan">she was perfectly happy.</font>

114
00:05:54,249 --> 00:05:56,570
<font color="#008000">Charlotte was very good</font>
<font color="#008000">at putting on a brave face.</font>

115
00:05:56,609 --> 00:05:59,850
<font color="#008000">And Mark was most probably the only</font>
<font color="#008000">one who knew how ill she was.</font>

116
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:04,570
But can we, you, really be certain
that he's telling the truth?

117
00:06:04,609 --> 00:06:07,809
<font color="#008000">The police investigated it</font>
<font color="#008000">thoroughly.</font>

118
00:06:09,129 --> 00:06:12,450
<font color="#008000">And the coroner has made it crystal</font>
<font color="#008000">clear that he was blameless.</font>

119
00:06:12,489 --> 00:06:13,970
<font color="#008000">It says so there.</font>

120
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:16,169
<font color="cyan">Mum, shouldn't we get in contact</font>
<font color="cyan">with this woman,</font>

121
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:19,010
<font color="cyan">just to clear the decks, make sure</font>
<font color="cyan">we know all the story? </font><font color="#008000">No!</font>

122
00:06:20,729 --> 00:06:23,929
<font color="#008000">I really don't want to discuss this</font>
<font color="#008000">with you any more.</font>

123
00:06:25,689 --> 00:06:29,289
<font color="#008000">You've clearly all decided</font>
<font color="#008000">that you don't like Mark.</font>

124
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:31,049
<font color="#008000">Or that you don't trust him.</font>

125
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:34,609
<font color="yellow">No, no, Mum. We're just really</font>
<font color="yellow">worried that he's...</font>

126
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:36,489
<font color="#008000">Going to kill me?</font>

127
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:39,729
<font color="#008000">Oh, for God's sake!</font>

128
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:43,970
<font color="#008000">Look, I'm leaving now</font>

129
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:46,210
<font color="#008000">because I don't want to fall out</font>
<font color="#008000">with you about this.</font>

130
00:06:46,249 --> 00:06:48,410
<font color="yellow">Oh, Mum, please, come on, just...</font>
<font color="#008000">No.</font>

131
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:49,850
<font color="#008000">I'm going.</font>

132
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:52,049
<font color="#008000">Look...</font>

133
00:06:53,369 --> 00:06:55,809
<font color="#008000">I want to have a lovely birthday...</font>

134
00:06:57,129 --> 00:06:58,570
<font color="#008000">..and a lovely holiday...</font>

00:06:58,609 --> 00:07:01,169
<font color="#008000">and a lovely marriage to Mark.</font>

136
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:04,369
<font color="#008000">Hopefully, with my children's</font>
<font color="#008000">blessing.</font>

137
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:07,929
<font color="#008000">Can you...?</font>

138
00:07:09,249 --> 00:07:11,010
<font color="#008000">Can you do that for me?</font>

139
00:07:14,489 --> 00:07:15,770
<font color="cyan">That went well.</font>

140
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:18,850
DOOR SLAMS

141
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:38,410
SHE TURNS OFF THE ENGINE

142
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:46,410
SHE EXHALES HEAVILY

143
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:50,289
Erm...

144
00:07:51,369 --> 00:07:52,689
Viv?

145
00:07:52,729 --> 00:07:54,330
Oh, darling, what...?

146
00:07:54,369 --> 00:07:56,330
What is it?
<font color="#008000">I'm just...</font>

147
00:07:56,369 --> 00:07:57,770
Are you all right? Hang on.

148
00:07:57,809 --> 00:07:59,090
<font color="#008000">I just feel...</font>

149
00:08:00,289 --> 00:08:01,530
Right.

150
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:03,729
Come on, come on.
<font color="#008000">I just feel a bit...</font>

151
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:07,929
KNOCK ON DOOR
It's 11 o'clock.

152
00:08:10,129 --> 00:08:11,330
Tea.

153
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:14,609
<font color="yellow">Did I hear Grandma's voice earlier?</font>

154
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:16,489
Yeah, she just...

155
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:18,369
just popped in for coffee.

156
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:21,169
<font color="yellow">Did you tell her that Dad's gone</font>
<font color="yellow">to stay with his sister?</font>

157
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:24,809
No, no, I...
don't want to worry her.

158
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:27,369
I'll tell her when she gets back
from holiday.

159
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:31,489
But hopefully,
he'll be home by then and...

160
00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:35,290
..everything will get back
to normal.

161
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:37,409
<font color="yellow">Mum...</font>

162
00:08:38,609 --> 00:08:40,210
<font color="yellow">..normal wasn't very good, was it?</font>

163
00:08:41,249 --> 00:08:42,690
<font color="yellow">Normal was why he went.</font>

164
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:46,810
<font color="yellow">He sent me another message</font>
<font color="yellow">last night.</font>

165
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:48,810
<font color="yellow">He didn't say anything</font>
<font color="yellow">about coming home.</font>

166
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:51,330
SHE SIGHS

167
00:08:51,369 --> 00:08:54,090
I tried him all day yesterday.

168
00:08:54,129 --> 00:08:56,249
I'll try him again today.

169
00:08:58,690 --> 00:08:59,810
<font color="yellow">Actually, Mum...</font>

170
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:03,570
<font color="yellow">..you have to stop going on at him.</font>

171
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:06,129
<font color="yellow">And you have to stop drinking</font>
<font color="yellow">so much.</font>

172
00:09:20,889 --> 00:09:22,729
MARY: Tea's almost ready.

173
00:09:52,609 --> 00:09:53,850
Here we go...

174
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:57,489
<font color="yellow">Oh, thanks.</font>

175
00:09:57,529 --> 00:09:59,889
You know, we had more fainters
than anything else

176
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:01,129
when I was a first aider.

177
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:05,050
<font color="yellow">You know, I've...</font>

178
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:07,690
<font color="yellow">..never, ever fainted in my life.</font>

179
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:11,369
<font color="yellow">Except once when I was pregnant</font>
<font color="yellow">with Natalie.</font>

180
00:10:11,409 --> 00:10:12,810
I remember it.

181
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:15,570
<font color="yellow">I don't know why it's become a thing</font>
<font color="yellow">with me now. I've no idea.</font>

182
00:10:15,609 --> 00:10:17,409
Well, it's the body's way
of telling you

183
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,090
something's not right, I suppose.

184
00:10:19,129 --> 00:10:20,609
<font color="yellow">Yeah, but what?</font>

185
00:10:20,649 --> 00:10:22,369
<font color="yellow">It's not like I'm stressed</font>
<font color="yellow">or anything.</font>

186
00:10:22,409 --> 00:10:24,050
Well...

187
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:25,369
SHE CHUCKLES

188
00:10:25,409 --> 00:10:26,930
<font color="yellow">Maybe just a bit.</font>

189
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:29,129
Come on, you've got a lot going on.

190
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:32,129
<font color="yellow">And you've always seemed</font>
<font color="yellow">to have been there for me</font>

191
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:33,649
<font color="yellow">in my hour of need, Mary.</font>

192
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:35,009
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

193
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:37,170
And you for me.

194
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:39,129
<font color="yellow">Well, I'm not so sure about that.</font>

195
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:43,050
Who took me to the hospital
with the baby...

196
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:45,409
and stayed with me all night
whilst...?

197
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:51,090
And brought me back again
when it was all...

198
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:56,769
..it was all finished.

199
00:10:59,249 --> 00:11:01,970
I'm always going to be here for you,
Viv. No question.

200
00:11:03,489 --> 00:11:04,690
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

201
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:08,409
Anyway, you don't want to be having
turns like this

202
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:09,609
when you're in India.

203
00:11:09,649 --> 00:11:11,450
<font color="yellow">Oh, no, I don't.</font>

204
00:11:11,489 --> 00:11:13,090
At least you'll have a doctor
with you.

205
00:11:13,129 --> 00:11:15,489
And, Viv, listen, don't worry
what the kids have to say

206
00:11:15,529 --> 00:11:17,489
about him and his wife
and all that malarkey.

207
00:11:17,529 --> 00:11:18,729
<font color="yellow">No?</font>

208
00:11:18,769 --> 00:11:20,210
No!

209
00:11:20,249 --> 00:11:23,090
Because as long as you believe him,
that's all that matters, isn't it?

210
00:11:23,129 --> 00:11:24,690
As long as you trust him.

211
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:46,810
Argh...!

212
00:11:49,129 --> 00:11:50,970
<font color="cyan">Dad...</font>
Yes?

213
00:11:51,009 --> 00:11:53,249
<font color="cyan">You know when we go to Disneyland...</font>

214
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:54,489
Yes.

215
00:11:54,529 --> 00:11:56,489
<font color="cyan">..can Mum come with us?</font>

216
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:00,649
<font color="yellow">Maybe.</font>

217
00:12:02,649 --> 00:12:04,489
That was a good question.

218
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:24,729
MARK SNORES GENTLY

219
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:09,529
<font color="yellow">Viv?</font>
SHE GASPS

220
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:11,690
<font color="yellow">What on earth are you doing?</font>

221
00:13:16,245 --> 00:13:18,884
<font color="yellow">On the day of the party,</font>

222
00:13:18,924 --> 00:13:19,924
<font color="yellow">am I right in thinking</font>

223
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:22,325
<font color="yellow">that you were under</font>
<font color="yellow">a lot of pressure at work?</font>

224
00:13:22,365 --> 00:13:24,924
What does...?
I mean, why does...?

225
00:13:24,965 --> 00:13:28,485
<font color="yellow">I'm just trying to piece together</font>
<font color="yellow">people's movements</font>

226
00:13:28,524 --> 00:13:30,764
<font color="yellow">and state of mind on that day.</font>

227
00:13:30,804 --> 00:13:34,644
<font color="yellow">We are creatures tethered</font>
<font color="yellow">to our emotions, aren't we?</font>

228
00:13:36,804 --> 00:13:38,924
Well, I just went to work, as usual.

229
00:13:48,524 --> 00:13:49,804
KNOCK ON DOOR

230
00:13:50,884 --> 00:13:53,004
Hi, Julianne. What's up?

231
00:13:53,044 --> 00:13:54,404
SIT DOWN.

232
00:13:54,445 --> 00:13:55,845
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

233
00:13:59,445 --> 00:14:02,365
<font color="yellow">Meera Kapoor's lawyer has been</font>
<font color="yellow">in touch.</font>

234
00:14:03,524 --> 00:14:06,004
<font color="yellow">And they're bringing a case</font>
<font color="yellow">of unfair dismissal against us.</font>

235
00:14:06,044 --> 00:14:07,205
What?

236
00:14:08,164 --> 00:14:09,924
Oh, for God's sake.

237
00:14:09,965 --> 00:14:11,884
Well, she hasn't got a leg
to stand on.

238
00:14:11,924 --> 00:14:13,524
Has she?

239
00:14:13,565 --> 00:14:14,924
<font color="yellow">And they're threatening</font>

240
00:14:14,965 --> 00:14:17,565
<font color="yellow">to bring another case against you,</font>
<font color="yellow">personally.</font>

241
00:14:17,605 --> 00:14:19,085
<font color="yellow">For harassment.</font>

242
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:22,085
Me?
<font color="yellow">Apparently, you went to her house.</font>

243
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:25,764
But she is stalking me,
my whole bloody family.

244
00:14:25,804 --> 00:14:29,085
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Helen, but she also has</font>
<font color="yellow">a number of images of you...</font>

245
00:14:30,284 --> 00:14:33,725
<font color="yellow">..which she has gathered from your</font>
<font color="yellow">daughter's social media account.</font>

246
00:14:33,764 --> 00:14:35,044
What?

247
00:14:38,764 --> 00:14:40,644
HELEN RETCHES AND COUGHS

248
00:14:40,684 --> 00:14:41,845
Oh, no...

249
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:46,565
<font color="yellow">There's more in a similar vein,</font>
<font color="yellow">I'm afraid.</font>

250
00:14:48,004 --> 00:14:50,404
<font color="yellow">Mostly alcohol-related.</font>

251
00:14:51,524 --> 00:14:53,884
<font color="yellow">And she's threatening to take it to</font>
<font color="yellow">the press.</font>

252
00:14:53,924 --> 00:14:55,125
Oh...

253
00:14:58,485 --> 00:15:03,205
So, she's, what?
She's... blackmailing us?

254
00:15:25,164 --> 00:15:28,125
<font color="yellow">Over the years, you collect</font>
<font color="yellow">all kinds of things as a doctor.</font>

255
00:15:30,485 --> 00:15:32,404
<font color="yellow">You learn to go prepared.</font>

256
00:15:32,445 --> 00:15:34,365
<font color="yellow">Especially if you're travelling.</font>

257
00:15:36,404 --> 00:15:37,764
<font color="yellow">Viv...</font>

258
00:15:38,965 --> 00:15:40,605
<font color="yellow">..we have to address this.</font>

259
00:15:42,845 --> 00:15:45,004
<font color="yellow">Because if we don't talk</font>
<font color="yellow">about it... </font>I know.

260
00:15:46,485 --> 00:15:50,284
<font color="yellow">..this marriage is dead</font>
<font color="yellow">before it's begun...</font>

261
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:53,164
<font color="yellow">..if there's no trust.</font>

262
00:15:54,845 --> 00:15:56,284
I do trust you.

263
00:15:56,325 --> 00:15:58,485
It's just that...
<font color="yellow">The kids don't.</font>

264
00:15:59,644 --> 00:16:03,524
<font color="yellow">I could feel it from day one</font>
<font color="yellow">from them.</font>

265
00:16:04,605 --> 00:16:06,924
<font color="yellow">Before they knew anything</font>
<font color="yellow">about Charlotte's death.</font>

266
00:16:06,965 --> 00:16:08,804
That's not true.

267
00:16:08,845 --> 00:16:10,205
<font color="yellow">Viv, it's true.</font>

268
00:16:12,725 --> 00:16:14,164
<font color="yellow">Do you think...</font>

269
00:16:14,205 --> 00:16:16,085
<font color="yellow">I'm looking forward to this</font>
<font color="yellow">evening,</font>

270
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:18,764
<font color="yellow">facing them,</font>
<font color="yellow">knowing what they think?</font>

271
00:16:19,764 --> 00:16:21,164
<font color="yellow">I could...</font>

272
00:16:22,404 --> 00:16:25,085
<font color="yellow">I could cope with that, Viv,</font>
<font color="yellow">I could cope with them.</font>

273
00:16:26,565 --> 00:16:29,605
<font color="yellow">But... the one thing I couldn't</font>
<font color="yellow">cope with...</font>

274
00:16:31,085 --> 00:16:33,004
<font color="yellow">..is if you don't trust me.</font>

275
00:16:35,485 --> 00:16:37,325
You have to remember that I...

276
00:16:39,884 --> 00:16:43,365
..I trusted Terry and he'd been
lying to me for all those years.

277
00:16:44,524 --> 00:16:45,804
So, of course I'm...

278
00:16:46,804 --> 00:16:47,845
<font color="yellow">Viv...</font>

279
00:16:47,884 --> 00:16:49,365

I haven't listened.

Or not properly.

Or just not enough.

And I don't blame you for going.

I can't...

370
00:23:35,884 --> 00:23:38,404
I can't even do that
without pushing you away.

371
00:23:41,525 --> 00:23:43,484
I just don't know what to do.

..went home and got changed first.

You know, it was a...

It was us...

382
00:24:23,285 --> 00:24:25,845
It was us saying goodbye to her...

00:24:27,045 --> 00:24:29,964
..before she left for India
on her honeymoon.

384

You know, it was...

385
00:24:35,404 --> 00:24:38,724
supposed to be the start

So, she's with you all the time,
then.

425
00:26:43,655 --> 00:26:46,135
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>
<font color="yellow">Oh, don't be silly, Nats.</font>

426
00:26:49,094 --> 00:26:50,615
I can't do this.
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

427
00:26:50,655 --> 00:26:51,734
<font color="yellow">Nats!</font>

428
00:28:14,975 --> 00:28:16,534
<font color="yellow">I've hung the lights.</font>

429
00:28:16,574 --> 00:28:18,895
<font color="yellow">I've opened a few bottles.</font>
<font color="yellow">Anything else?</font>

430
00:28:18,935 --> 00:28:21,175
HE GROANS
That's great, thanks.

431
00:28:21,215 --> 00:28:25,415
<font color="yellow">Just think, this time tomorrow,</font>
<font color="yellow">we'll be on a plane to India!</font>

432
00:28:25,455 --> 00:28:28,014
I wish you'd just enjoy
this evening.

433
00:28:28,054 --> 00:28:30,494
I'm sure they'll be all
on their best behaviour.

434
00:28:30,534 --> 00:28:31,734
MARY: <font color="cyan">Yoo-hoo!</font>

435
00:28:31,774 --> 00:28:33,014
<font color="yellow">Oh...</font>

436
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:36,695
SHE CHUCKLES
She was always the first.

437
00:28:37,734 --> 00:28:38,975
She means well.

438
00:28:39,014 --> 00:28:41,574
Would you do the honours
while I get dressed?

439
00:28:44,334 --> 00:28:45,814
Hm.

440
00:28:56,574 --> 00:28:57,814
<font color="yellow">Hi, Mary.</font>

441
00:28:57,855 --> 00:28:59,054
<font color="yellow">You look...</font>

442
00:28:59,094 --> 00:29:01,375
<font color="yellow">..different.</font>
<font color="cyan">How are you doing, Mark?</font>

443
00:29:01,415 --> 00:29:03,094
<font color="cyan">A spot of Dutch courage, hey?</font>

444
00:29:03,135 --> 00:29:05,054
<font color="cyan">Not to worry.</font>
<font color="cyan">It'll soon all be over.</font>

445
00:29:05,094 --> 00:29:07,054
<font color="cyan">I'm just going to pop Viv's</font>
<font color="cyan">present up to her.</font>

446
00:29:07,094 --> 00:29:09,054
<font color="yellow">She's just getting dressed,</font>
<font color="yellow">actually.</font>

447
00:29:10,254 --> 00:29:11,494
<font color="cyan">Vivien!</font>

448
00:29:11,534 --> 00:29:12,814
<font color="cyan">It's only me!</font>

449
00:29:20,014 --> 00:29:21,375
<font color="cyan">Hi!</font>

450
00:29:21,415 --> 00:29:23,014
Oh, hi, Mary.

451
00:29:23,054 --> 00:29:24,695
<font color="cyan">Close your eyes.</font>

452
00:29:26,375 --> 00:29:29,175
<font color="cyan">I wanted to bring your present in</font>
<font color="cyan">while you were on your own.</font>

453
00:29:30,175 --> 00:29:32,415
<font color="cyan">I haven't wrapped it, I'm afraid.</font>
Oh, dear.

454
00:29:33,655 --> 00:29:35,175
It's not a puppy, is it?

455
00:29:35,215 --> 00:29:36,895
THEY BOTH LAUGH

456
00:29:36,935 --> 00:29:38,935
<font color="cyan">Hang on.</font>

457
00:29:40,135 --> 00:29:42,135
{\an8}<font color="cyan">OK, and...</font>

458
00:29:43,135 --> 00:29:44,655
{\an8}<font color="cyan">..open them.</font>

459
00:29:46,814 --> 00:29:48,494
{\an8}Oh, my Lord.

460
00:29:48,534 --> 00:29:50,655
{\an8}It's gorgeous!

461
00:29:50,695 --> 00:29:53,135
{\an8}<font color="cyan">It's got bits of all the kids'</font>
<font color="cyan">old clothes in it.</font>

462
00:29:53,175 --> 00:29:57,375
{\an8}Oh, Mary, it must have taken you
hours and hours.

463
00:29:58,455 --> 00:30:00,254
{\an8}Oh, thank you!

464
00:30:01,375 --> 00:30:03,294
{\an8}<font color="cyan">Happy birthday.</font>
Oh...

465
00:30:04,615 --> 00:30:05,935
Thank you.

466
00:30:06,935 --> 00:30:08,375
It's wonderful.

467
00:30:10,534 --> 00:30:12,094
Aw...

468
00:30:13,655 --> 00:30:15,655
And you look lovely, too.

469
00:30:16,734 --> 00:30:18,094
Is that...?
<font color="cyan">Yes!</font>

470
00:30:18,135 --> 00:30:19,334
<font color="cyan">Yes!</font>

471
00:30:19,375 --> 00:30:22,334
<font color="cyan">I shortened it and I just cut</font>
<font color="cyan">all the neckline a bit.</font>

472
00:30:23,695 --> 00:30:25,695
CAR HORN TOOTS
<font color="cyan">Oh, here they come!</font>

473
00:30:25,734 --> 00:30:27,455
Oh-oh, right.

474
00:30:27,494 --> 00:30:28,814
Now...

475
00:30:30,054 --> 00:30:33,215
..let's just hope they all play
nicely, Mary.

476
00:30:33,254 --> 00:30:34,975
Yeah, no, just give me a hand...

477
00:30:35,014 --> 00:30:36,494
HELEN: <font color="#008000">Hi, Mum!</font>

478
00:30:39,814 --> 00:30:41,494
<font color="#008000">Happy birthday!</font>

479
00:30:41,534 --> 00:30:42,895
Aw...!

480
00:30:42,935 --> 00:30:44,094
Hello, darling.

481
00:30:45,215 --> 00:30:46,534
No George?

482
00:30:46,574 --> 00:30:48,334
<font color="#008000">No, sorry, man flu.</font>

483
00:30:48,375 --> 00:30:50,334
<font color="#008000">He got it off his sister.</font>
Oh...

484
00:30:51,695 --> 00:30:52,774
<font color="#008000">Hi, Mary.</font>

485
00:30:52,814 --> 00:30:55,415
<font color="#008000">You look lovely.</font>
<font color="cyan">Ah, thank you.</font>

486
00:30:55,455 --> 00:30:57,094
<font color="#008000">Hi.</font>
<font color="yellow">Hi, Helen.</font>

487
00:30:57,135 --> 00:30:58,215
NATALIE: <font color="cyan">Hiya!</font>

488
00:30:59,935 --> 00:31:02,094
Hi.
<font color="cyan">Happy birthday.</font>

489
00:31:02,135 --> 00:31:03,455
Mm, thank you.

490
00:31:03,494 --> 00:31:05,494
<font color="cyan">I'll bring them up.</font>
OK.

491
00:31:05,534 --> 00:31:07,534
Thanks for the flowers, Helen.
<font color="#008000">OK.</font>

492
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:10,254
Can you bring up a plate, Mark?
<font color="yellow">OK.</font>

493
00:31:10,294 --> 00:31:12,215
<font color="cyan">Have you told Mum about your job</font>
<font color="cyan">yet?</font>

494
00:31:12,254 --> 00:31:13,494
<font color="#008000">No. Not tonight.</font>

495
00:31:13,534 --> 00:31:15,534
<font color="#008000">I need to get my head</font>
<font color="#008000">straight first.</font>

496
00:31:15,574 --> 00:31:17,855
<font color="#008000">If that's remotely possible</font>
<font color="#008000">ever again.</font>

497
00:31:19,014 --> 00:31:20,094
<font color="#008000">How are you doing?</font>

498
00:31:22,175 --> 00:31:23,415
<font color="#008000">What?</font>

499
00:31:24,814 --> 00:31:26,334
<font color="cyan">My period's late.</font>

500
00:31:27,935 --> 00:31:29,615
<font color="#008000">Oh, Nats.</font>

501
00:31:29,655 --> 00:31:31,334
<font color="cyan">Yeah, I know. Ironic, isn't it?</font>

502
00:31:31,375 --> 00:31:34,054
<font color="#008000">What, have you done a test?</font>
<font color="cyan">No, not yet.</font>

503
00:31:34,094 --> 00:31:36,494
<font color="cyan">I really need a drink to get</font>
<font color="cyan">through tonight.</font>

504
00:31:36,534 --> 00:31:37,655
<font color="#008000">Christ, me, too.</font>

505
00:31:40,574 --> 00:31:43,375
<font color="cyan">Don't say anything to Jake, though,</font>
<font color="cyan">will you?</font>

506
00:31:43,415 --> 00:31:45,415
<font color="cyan">Or Mark, obviously.</font>
<font color="#008000">Obviously.</font>

507
00:31:48,135 --> 00:31:51,215
<font color="cyan">I can't look him in the eye, Mark,</font>
<font color="cyan">can you? </font><font color="#008000">No.</font>

508
00:31:51,254 --> 00:31:53,455
<font color="#008000">I think Mum's told him.</font>

509
00:31:53,494 --> 00:31:55,695
<font color="#008000">He looks really shifty, doesn't he?</font>
<font color="cyan">Guilty as hell.</font>

510
00:31:55,734 --> 00:31:57,415
JAKE: Hello.
<font color="#008000">Hi.</font>

511
00:31:57,455 --> 00:31:58,695
<font color="cyan">Hey.</font>
Hey.

512
00:31:58,734 --> 00:32:00,695
<font color="cyan">Welcome to the most awkward</font>
<font color="cyan">birthday drinks</font>

513
00:32:00,734 --> 00:32:01,975
<font color="cyan">in the history of the world.</font>

514
00:32:02,014 --> 00:32:03,814
Yeah, but it's not funny,
though, is it?

515
00:32:03,855 --> 00:32:05,375
<font color="#008000">Have you been drinking?</font>

516
00:32:05,415 --> 00:32:07,215
Why, have you?

517
00:32:19,215 --> 00:32:21,175
What are you doing out here?

518
00:32:21,215 --> 00:32:23,415
Please, please, come in
and be sociable.

519
00:32:23,455 --> 00:32:25,175
At least make an effort.

520
00:32:26,254 --> 00:32:27,494
What's this?

521
00:32:28,574 --> 00:32:30,014
<font color="yellow">What it looks like.</font>

522
00:32:31,054 --> 00:32:32,375
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

523
00:32:32,415 --> 00:32:34,774
<font color="yellow">I used to. I gave up.</font>
<font color="yellow">What can I say?</font>

524
00:32:34,814 --> 00:32:36,935
<font color="yellow">Doctors and nurses are the worst.</font>

525
00:32:36,975 --> 00:32:38,734
You've never mentioned it.

526
00:32:38,774 --> 00:32:40,254
<font color="yellow">It never came up.</font>

527
00:32:41,375 --> 00:32:42,814
<font color="yellow">Look, Viv...</font>
<font color="cyan">Sorry to interrupt.</font>

528
00:32:42,855 --> 00:32:43,855
<font color="cyan">Just doing the rounds.</font>

529
00:32:43,895 --> 00:32:46,655
<font color="cyan">Top up?</font>
No, I'm fine, thanks, Mary.

530
00:32:46,695 --> 00:32:49,094
<font color="cyan">Mark?</font>
<font color="yellow">Yes, please.</font>

531
00:32:49,135 --> 00:32:50,855
<font color="cyan">Oh, smoking.</font>

532
00:32:50,895 --> 00:32:53,294
<font color="cyan">It's a brave man</font>
<font color="cyan">who smokes near Vivien.</font>

533
00:33:16,444 --> 00:33:18,164
LAUGHTER

534
00:33:18,205 --> 00:33:22,084
HELEN: <font color="#008000">Right, charge your glasses.</font>
VIVIEN: Oh!

535
00:33:22,124 --> 00:33:24,045
<font color="#008000">Come on. Come on, Mary.</font>

536
00:33:24,084 --> 00:33:25,844
<font color="#008000">Everyone, get ready for a speech.</font>

537
00:33:25,884 --> 00:33:29,164
<font color="#008000">Mum, out here.</font>
JAKE: <font color="cyan">She's got a speech!</font>

538
00:33:29,205 --> 00:33:31,364
<font color="#008000">OK, come on. Oh, Mary...</font>

539
00:33:31,404 --> 00:33:33,965
<font color="#008000">OK, well, I just want to say...</font>

540
00:33:34,005 --> 00:33:37,364
<font color="#008000">happy birthday to...</font>

541
00:33:37,404 --> 00:33:40,884
<font color="#008000">a really, really amazing mum.</font>

542
00:33:40,924 --> 00:33:43,164
<font color="cyan">Yeah. </font>Hear, hear.
<font color="yellow">Happy birthday, Mum.</font>

543
00:33:43,205 --> 00:33:46,644
<font color="#008000">You know, you really gave us</font>
<font color="#008000">the best possible start in life.</font>

544
00:33:46,684 --> 00:33:50,045
<font color="#008000">A happy, secure, loving family.</font>

545
00:33:50,084 --> 00:33:52,285
<font color="#008000">A great place to grow up.</font>

546
00:33:52,325 --> 00:33:56,285
<font color="#008000">You know, and even now we are</font>
<font color="#008000">grown-up, you're still here for us.</font>

547
00:33:56,325 --> 00:33:57,965
<font color="#008000">Always.</font>

548
00:33:58,005 --> 00:34:00,004
<font color="#008000">Whatever...</font>

549
00:34:00,044 --> 00:34:01,884
<font color="#008000">Whatever messes...</font>

550
00:34:01,924 --> 00:34:03,844
<font color="#008000">we get ourselves into.</font>

551
00:34:03,884 --> 00:34:08,765
<font color="#008000">Erm... </font><font color="cyan">Yeah, and not only is</font>
<font color="cyan">she a great mum,</font>

552
00:34:08,805 --> 00:34:12,004
<font color="cyan">but she did it all</font>
<font color="cyan">while running the salon.</font>

553
00:34:12,044 --> 00:34:14,484
<font color="cyan">So, you're an amazing role model.</font>

554
00:34:14,524 --> 00:34:15,805
<font color="cyan">Well, apart from the cooking.</font>

555
00:34:15,844 --> 00:34:17,404
LAUGHTER

556
00:34:17,444 --> 00:34:19,964
Well, luckily, you have Mary
for that.

557
00:34:20,004 --> 00:34:24,044
<font color="cyan">Oh, it's a pleasure,</font>
<font color="cyan">a privilege to be part of you all.</font>

558
00:34:24,085 --> 00:34:25,484
<font color="cyan">So, here's to you, Vivien.</font>

559
00:34:25,524 --> 00:34:28,044
<font color="#008000">Yes, happy birthday to the best mum.</font>

560
00:34:28,085 --> 00:34:29,725
<font color="yellow">I want to say something, too,</font>
<font color="yellow">actually.</font>

561
00:34:29,765 --> 00:34:32,004
<font color="yellow">Excuse me, can I have some more?</font>
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

562
00:34:32,044 --> 00:34:34,685
<font color="yellow">I want to say something about Dad.</font>

563
00:34:34,725 --> 00:34:36,285
<font color="yellow">Erm...</font>

564
00:34:38,245 --> 00:34:41,765
<font color="yellow">We can't pretend he wasn't</font>
<font color="yellow">a huge part of this family...</font>

565
00:34:41,805 --> 00:34:44,325
<font color="yellow">and that we don't miss him still.</font>

566
00:34:44,364 --> 00:34:46,605
<font color="yellow">Because we do.</font>

567
00:34:46,645 --> 00:34:48,964
<font color="yellow">We can't just airbrush him out.</font>

568
00:34:50,085 --> 00:34:52,364
<font color="yellow">Yeah, he wasn't, er...</font>

569
00:34:52,404 --> 00:34:55,564
<font color="yellow">he wasn't perfect, as you said.</font>

570
00:34:55,605 --> 00:34:58,285
<font color="yellow">But he was a very...</font>

571
00:34:58,325 --> 00:35:01,285
<font color="yellow">..very, very good father to us</font>
<font color="yellow">three. Wasn't he?</font>

572
00:35:01,325 --> 00:35:03,964
Yes, yes, absolutely.

573
00:35:04,004 --> 00:35:07,165
To your father.
<font color="cyan">Here's to Terry.</font>

574
00:35:07,205 --> 00:35:09,165
<font color="#008000">To Dad.</font>
<font color="yellow">I love you, Dad.</font>

575
00:35:12,245 --> 00:35:14,685
And can I say how proud
I am of you all?

576
00:35:15,805 --> 00:35:17,044
You three...

577
00:35:18,165 --> 00:35:19,964
You three are the loves of my life.

578
00:35:21,004 --> 00:35:22,844
And my greatest achievement.

579
00:35:24,484 --> 00:35:26,805
And I'd like to thank Mark, too...

580
00:35:28,004 --> 00:35:29,805
..for taking me on.

581
00:35:35,245 --> 00:35:37,085
<font color="yellow">Here's to you, Viv.</font>

582
00:35:38,205 --> 00:35:40,004
<font color="yellow">And to your...</font>

583
00:35:40,044 --> 00:35:42,564
<font color="yellow">wonderful, wonderful family.</font>

584
00:35:44,325 --> 00:35:45,605
<font color="cyan">Oh, dear.</font>

585
00:35:45,645 --> 00:35:47,805
<font color="yellow">What's that supposed to mean,</font>
<font color="yellow">Mark? </font>Jake!

586
00:35:47,844 --> 00:35:49,205
<font color="yellow">No. No, no.</font>

587
00:35:49,245 --> 00:35:50,605
<font color="yellow">Let him speak.</font>

588
00:35:52,004 --> 00:35:53,964
<font color="yellow">If you've got something to say,</font>
<font color="yellow">say it to my face.</font>

589
00:35:54,004 --> 00:35:55,245
<font color="cyan">All right, then.</font>

590
00:35:56,245 --> 00:35:58,564
<font color="cyan">I'm not going to pretend that we're</font>
<font color="cyan">happy about you and Mum.</font>

591
00:35:58,605 --> 00:35:59,645
<font color="cyan">Because we're not.</font>

592
00:35:59,685 --> 00:36:02,404
<font color="yellow">No, you've already made that</font>
<font color="yellow">blindingly clear.</font>

593
00:36:02,444 --> 00:36:03,884
<font color="yellow">But, er...</font>

594
00:36:03,924 --> 00:36:07,884
<font color="yellow">if I may say so,</font>
<font color="yellow">it's none of your fucking business.</font>

595
00:36:07,924 --> 00:36:09,404
<font color="cyan">Oh, wow...</font>
Mark...!

596
00:36:09,444 --> 00:36:11,245
<font color="#008000">We're just concerned for Mum,</font>
<font color="#008000">that's all.</font>

597
00:36:11,285 --> 00:36:13,205
<font color="#008000">Ow!</font>
NATALIE: Don't touch her!

598
00:36:13,245 --> 00:36:15,765
<font color="cyan">Yeah, you know, before Mum met you,</font>

599
00:36:15,805 --> 00:36:18,605
<font color="cyan">she hasn't been sick a day</font>
<font color="cyan">in her life.</font>

600
00:36:18,645 --> 00:36:20,605
<font color="yellow">Are you accusing me?</font>
<font color="cyan">You're a doctor, aren't you?</font>

601
00:36:20,645 --> 00:36:22,245
<font color="cyan">Dr Mark, right?</font>

602
00:36:22,285 --> 00:36:25,205
<font color="cyan">You know where to get all the</font>
<font color="cyan">medicines, how to administer them.</font>

603
00:36:25,245 --> 00:36:28,325
<font color="yellow">You haven't a fucking clue</font>
<font color="yellow">about anything. </font>Stop it.

604
00:36:28,364 --> 00:36:30,645
Stop it, please.
Please...

605
00:36:30,685 --> 00:36:31,844
<font color="cyan">The police have been on to you</font>

606
00:36:31,884 --> 00:36:34,044
<font color="cyan">and I know all about that woman</font>
<font color="cyan">who stood up in court</font>

607
00:36:34,085 --> 00:36:36,765
<font color="cyan">and told everyone everything</font>
<font color="cyan">about your late wife.</font>

608
00:36:36,805 --> 00:36:39,645
<font color="cyan">We know all about that, Mark,</font>
<font color="cyan">cos we've done all the research.</font>

609
00:36:39,685 --> 00:36:41,085
<font color="#008000">Mum...</font>
<font color="cyan">Vivien!</font>

610
00:36:41,125 --> 00:36:43,285
<font color="cyan">Oh, my God! Oh, my God!</font>
JAKE: Mum...?

611
00:36:43,325 --> 00:36:45,044
<font color="yellow">Let me look at her.</font>

612
00:36:45,085 --> 00:36:47,884
<font color="#008000">Maybe get some water.</font>
<font color="#008000">Just get away!</font>

613
00:36:47,924 --> 00:36:50,325
<font color="cyan">Mark, get back, please.</font>
<font color="yellow">I'm a doctor!</font>

614
00:36:50,364 --> 00:36:52,964
<font color="yellow">She needs to see a doctor!</font>
<font color="cyan">Don't you fucking touch her!</font>

615
00:36:53,004 --> 00:36:54,245
<font color="yellow">You idiot!</font>

616
00:36:54,285 --> 00:36:56,484
<font color="cyan">Urgh!</font>

617
00:36:56,524 --> 00:36:57,645
<font color="#008000">Jake!</font>

618
00:36:57,685 --> 00:36:59,524
<font color="#008000">Jake, look...</font>

619
00:36:59,564 --> 00:37:01,165
<font color="#008000">What?!</font>

620
00:37:05,044 --> 00:37:06,444
<font color="cyan">Fuck!</font>

621
00:37:11,004 --> 00:37:12,245
SHE GASPS

622
00:37:23,605 --> 00:37:25,004
Natalie...

623
00:37:25,044 --> 00:37:26,245
You, er...

624
00:37:27,285 --> 00:37:30,844
You go into Mum and get a chair
and put her legs up onto it.

625
00:37:30,884 --> 00:37:32,484
And, Helen, phone...

626
00:37:32,524 --> 00:37:35,725
..phone an ambulance and tell them
there's been an accident.

627
00:37:35,765 --> 00:37:37,524
A man has fallen...

628
00:37:37,564 --> 00:37:42,325
Erm, he slipped
and he's fallen from a balcony, OK?

629
00:37:42,364 --> 00:37:43,765
No, no, this is nobody's fault

630
00:37:43,805 --> 00:37:46,004
cos if Mark hadn't been
drinking so much,

631
00:37:46,044 --> 00:37:48,444
he wouldn't have fallen.
Do you understand?

632
00:37:48,484 --> 00:37:50,444
Go on, go.
Go on.

633
00:37:50,484 --> 00:37:51,924
Jake...

634
00:37:51,964 --> 00:37:54,165
Jake, are you all right?
Are you all right?

635
00:37:54,205 --> 00:37:55,395
Come on.

636
00:37:55,435 --> 00:37:56,766
Come on.

637
00:38:07,404 --> 00:38:08,765
JAKE: <font color="cyan">Go!</font>

638
00:38:08,805 --> 00:38:10,245
<font color="cyan">That's it, go!</font>

639
00:39:03,444 --> 00:39:06,285
INSPECTOR: Now, apart from
his head injuries, it says here,

640
00:39:06,325 --> 00:39:08,205
"Bruising around the torso."

641
00:39:09,325 --> 00:39:13,524
Is there any evidence he could
have been pushed over the balcony?

642
00:39:13,564 --> 00:39:15,765
<font color="yellow">Er, his balance would</font>
<font color="yellow">have been way off,</font>

643
00:39:15,805 --> 00:39:18,484
<font color="yellow">given the amount of alcohol</font>
<font color="yellow">and diazepam in his blood.</font>

644
00:39:18,524 --> 00:39:20,444
<font color="yellow">So, I really can't say.</font>

645
00:39:22,245 --> 00:39:24,205
What's the likelihood he'll wake up?

646
00:39:24,245 --> 00:39:26,245
<font color="yellow">It's not looking good at all.</font>

647
00:39:41,924 --> 00:39:43,325
<font color="yellow">Are you all right, girls?</font>

648
00:39:43,364 --> 00:39:44,844
<font color="#008000">Hi, Mary.</font>

649
00:39:45,844 --> 00:39:48,484
<font color="yellow">I've put the salmon on.</font>
<font color="yellow">Oh, good, you've started the peas.</font>

650
00:39:50,444 --> 00:39:52,245
<font color="yellow">I'll go and check on Mum.</font>

651
00:40:17,924 --> 00:40:19,844
<font color="yellow">Well, everyone was having</font>
<font color="yellow">a lovely time.</font>

652
00:40:19,884 --> 00:40:22,725
<font color="yellow">You know, we had champagne, music,</font>
<font color="yellow">a few speeches.</font>

653
00:40:24,125 --> 00:40:27,205
<font color="yellow">But I don't think any of us realised</font>
<font color="yellow">how much Mark had been drinking.</font>

654
00:40:29,645 --> 00:40:31,564
<font color="yellow">How are you feeling today?</font>

655
00:40:33,605 --> 00:40:34,924
No, I'm fine.

656
00:40:37,165 --> 00:40:38,484
<font color="yellow">Good.</font>

657
00:40:39,524 --> 00:40:41,245
<font color="yellow">Let's get you dressed, then.</font>

658
00:40:42,605 --> 00:40:45,404
<font color="yellow">Because Helen's going to take you</font>
<font color="yellow">back to the hospital after lunch.</font>

659
00:40:46,725 --> 00:40:49,564
<font color="yellow">What would you like to wear?</font>
You choose.

660
00:40:50,564 --> 00:40:51,765
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>

661
00:40:51,805 --> 00:40:53,364
MARY:
<font color="yellow">Mark got up to go inside and he...</font>

662
00:40:55,325 --> 00:40:57,765
<font color="yellow">..he must have lost his footing</font>
<font color="yellow">and he slipped and...</font>

663
00:40:59,325 --> 00:41:01,605
<font color="yellow">..he sort of keeled over</font>
<font color="yellow">and then crashed...</font>

664
00:41:02,805 --> 00:41:04,484
<font color="yellow">..through the railings.</font>

665
00:41:04,524 --> 00:41:05,805
<font color="yellow">I saw Jake reach out to grab him.</font>

666
00:41:05,844 --> 00:41:07,325
<font color="yellow">But he wasn't close enough.</font>

667
00:41:09,364 --> 00:41:10,805
<font color="yellow">Thanks.</font>

668
00:41:10,844 --> 00:41:12,205
NATALIE: <font color="cyan">Here we are.</font>

669
00:41:16,444 --> 00:41:19,245
<font color="yellow">And then I heard a noise behind me</font>
<font color="yellow">and Vivien had just...</font>

670
00:41:20,245 --> 00:41:22,004
<font color="yellow">..collapsed from the shock of it.</font>

671
00:41:27,765 --> 00:41:29,645
MARY: <font color="yellow">And for a moment...</font>

672
00:41:29,685 --> 00:41:31,165
<font color="yellow">Well, we just didn't know</font>
<font color="yellow">what to do.</font>

673
00:41:32,484 --> 00:41:34,165
INSPECTOR: And then what happened?

674
00:41:34,205 --> 00:41:37,404
<font color="yellow">Helen called an ambulance.</font>
<font color="yellow">And I went to help Mark.</font>

675
00:41:37,444 --> 00:41:39,245
<font color="yellow">Because I'd done some first aid</font>
<font color="yellow">years ago</font>

676
00:41:39,285 --> 00:41:42,924
<font color="yellow">and I thought, well, I hoped,</font>
<font color="yellow">I might be able to help him.</font>

677
00:41:44,605 --> 00:41:46,165
<font color="cyan">Mum, there's a chair here.</font>

678
00:41:56,725 --> 00:41:58,725
INSPECTOR: And when you
got down there,

679
00:41:58,765 --> 00:42:00,725
what state did you find
Mr Kinneally in?

680
00:42:03,524 --> 00:42:05,205
<font color="yellow">'He...</font>

681
00:42:05,245 --> 00:42:07,205
<font color="yellow">'He was unconscious.</font>

682
00:42:07,245 --> 00:42:09,165
<font color="yellow">'And I couldn't find a pulse.'</font>

683
00:42:19,964 --> 00:42:22,605
AARON: <font color="#008000">That looks amazing!</font>
<font color="cyan">Oh, wow!</font>

684
00:42:24,245 --> 00:42:25,805
<font color="#008000">That is huge.</font>

685
00:42:25,844 --> 00:42:29,004
INSPECTOR: Was he still breathing
at this point?

686
00:42:30,484 --> 00:42:31,844
<font color="yellow">'No.</font>

687
00:42:31,884 --> 00:42:34,004
<font color="yellow">And I knew it was vital</font>

688
00:42:34,044 --> 00:42:35,605
<font color="yellow">to keep the oxygen flowing,</font>

689
00:42:35,645 --> 00:42:38,444
<font color="yellow">so I thought, "I have got</font>
<font color="yellow">to try mouth-to-mouth."</font>

690
00:42:52,884 --> 00:42:54,364
MARY: <font color="yellow">Shall I dish up?</font>

691
00:42:54,404 --> 00:42:55,685
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>

692
00:42:56,805 --> 00:42:58,444
<font color="yellow">Has everyone got everything</font>
<font color="yellow">they need?</font>

693
00:42:58,484 --> 00:42:59,964
<font color="#008000">Yes.</font>
<font color="cyan">Thanks.</font>

694
00:43:01,085 --> 00:43:03,884
INSPECTOR: You've had experience
of mouth-to-mouth resuscitation?

695
00:43:04,924 --> 00:43:08,444
MARY: <font color="yellow">I had some, but it's probably</font>
<font color="yellow">very outdated.</font>

696
00:43:08,484 --> 00:43:10,205
<font color="yellow">Still, I just kept going.</font>

697
00:43:10,245 --> 00:43:13,364
<font color="yellow">I kept going at it</font>
<font color="yellow">until the ambulance arrived.</font>

698
00:43:14,685 --> 00:43:16,685
<font color="yellow">And I did everything I could.</font>

699
00:43:18,924 --> 00:43:20,645
<font color="yellow">I did everything...</font>

700
00:43:22,285 --> 00:43:23,924
<font color="yellow">..everything I could.</font>

701
00:43:37,725 --> 00:43:42,285
AMBULANCE SIREN WAILS

702
00:43:56,685 --> 00:43:58,484
<font color="yellow">And I did everything I could.</font>

703
00:44:00,924 --> 00:44:02,685
<font color="yellow">I did everything...</font>

704
00:44:04,564 --> 00:44:06,444
<font color="yellow">..everything I could.</font>

705
00:44:08,605 --> 00:44:10,605
<font color="yellow">Bon appetit, everyone.</font>

706
00:44:13,404 --> 00:44:14,924
<font color="cyan">OK, Mum?</font>

707
00:44:29,844 --> 00:44:32,765
<font color="yellow">So, we finally tracked down</font>
<font color="yellow">Mark Kinneally's daughter in Spain.</font>

708
00:44:32,805 --> 00:44:34,325
<font color="yellow">She's on a plane now.</font>

709
00:44:34,364 --> 00:44:36,484
INSPECTOR: So, she does exist, then?

710
00:44:37,564 --> 00:44:40,285
POLICEMAN: <font color="yellow">Yes, it seems</font>
<font color="yellow">they were very close.</font>

711
00:44:41,484 --> 00:44:42,645
<font color="yellow">Shall we bring her in?</font>

712
00:44:43,924 --> 00:44:45,484
No.

713
00:44:45,524 --> 00:44:47,645
No, let her go to the hospital.

714
00:44:48,924 --> 00:44:51,245
<font color="yellow">We've got nothing here</font>
<font color="yellow">but an accident.</font>

715
00:44:51,285 --> 00:44:52,884
<font color="yellow">I can't justify more time.</font>

716
00:44:55,205 --> 00:44:56,645
Yes, sir.

717
00:45:03,404 --> 00:45:05,205
HE SIGHS

718
00:45:34,964 --> 00:45:37,844
INSPECTOR: What effect has
all this had on the family?

719
00:45:41,805 --> 00:45:43,924
MARY: <font color="yellow">Well, they're in shock and...</font>

720
00:45:43,964 --> 00:45:46,725
<font color="yellow">..and, of course,</font>
<font color="yellow">it'll be terrible for Vivien</font>

721
00:45:46,765 --> 00:45:48,564
<font color="yellow">if Mark doesn't pull through.</font>

722
00:45:53,645 --> 00:45:55,765
<font color="yellow">But she'll get over it, in time.</font>

723
00:45:58,444 --> 00:46:00,725
<font color="yellow">She's actually very strong.</font>

724
00:46:03,884 --> 00:46:05,245
<font color="yellow">And anyway...</font>

725
00:46:06,605 --> 00:46:09,044
<font color="yellow">..the good thing is</font>
<font color="yellow">I'll be there for her.</font>

726
00:46:12,364 --> 00:46:14,325
<font color="yellow">It'll just be the two of us.</font>
