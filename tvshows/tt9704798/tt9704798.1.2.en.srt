1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,299
I have met a new friend.

2
00:00:02,339 --> 00:00:03,460
<font color="yellow">A boyfriend?</font>

3
00:00:04,819 --> 00:00:07,180
<font color="cyan">You don't honestly think</font>
<font color="cyan">that he's only after her</font>

4
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:08,220
<font color="cyan">for her money, do you?</font>

5
00:00:08,259 --> 00:00:09,980
You were looking through my things?

6
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:13,980
<font color="#008000">When she began spending</font>
<font color="#008000">all that time with Mark,</font>

7
00:00:14,019 --> 00:00:16,700
<font color="#008000">I think that's when things started</font>
<font color="#008000">falling apart.</font>

8
00:00:16,739 --> 00:00:20,220
I was pushed out of my job
because you needed a scapegoat.

9
00:00:20,259 --> 00:00:21,579
<font color="cyan">Sex isn't like that.</font>

10
00:00:21,619 --> 00:00:24,139
<font color="yellow">Come on...</font>
<font color="cyan">I'm not a project for you to manage.</font>

11
00:00:27,099 --> 00:00:28,779
I want our little family back.

12
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,939
<font color="yellow">I don't really want to discuss it</font>
<font color="yellow">until you've paid back every penny.</font>

13
00:00:31,979 --> 00:00:34,299
<font color="cyan">Oh, it's in the drawer.</font>

14
00:00:34,339 --> 00:00:36,820
Thank you, Stella.
That's very generous.

15
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:42,460
<font color="#008000">Who was that on the phone?</font>
<font color="yellow">Your wife.</font>

16
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,820
<font color="yellow">I'm pregnant.</font>
<font color="#008000">'What?'</font>

17
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:46,540
<font color="cyan">It's Mark.</font>
<font color="yellow">'Is everything OK?'</font>

18
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:48,259
<font color="cyan">It's your mum. She's collapsed.</font>

19
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:50,979
I just think he's got
a really strange hold over her.

20
00:00:51,019 --> 00:00:53,220
<font color="cyan">And you might want to take</font>
<font color="cyan">one of these.</font>

21
00:00:53,259 --> 00:00:54,540
<font color="cyan">It's a very mild tranquillizer.</font>

22
00:00:54,579 --> 00:00:56,939
Someone is fighting for their life
in hospital.

23
00:00:56,979 --> 00:00:59,379
<font color="yellow">But it was an accident.</font>
Maybe.

24
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,420
But if not, then it's murder.

25
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:07,660
<font color="#008000">I never, ever dreamt</font>
<font color="#008000">it would end like this.</font>

<font color="cyan">Wha...?</font>

28
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,659
<font color="cyan">Mary?</font>

29
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,140
<font color="cyan">What the hell's going on?</font>

30
00:02:19,499 --> 00:02:20,860
<font color="#008000">You can't believe it, can you?</font>

31
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,460
<font color="cyan">But she's only just</font>
<font color="cyan">got out of hospital.</font>

32
00:02:23,659 --> 00:02:27,860
So, your mother's decision
to sell the family house...

33
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,779
Did that cause any tension
in the family?

34
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,260
<font color="cyan">Is, is this really relevant?</font>

35
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:37,619
A human life is hanging
in the balance, Miss Haleford.

36
00:02:37,659 --> 00:02:39,580
Everything is relevant.

37
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,219
<font color="cyan">No. Mum just felt the time had come</font>
<font color="cyan">to move on,</font>

38
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:46,219
<font color="cyan">and we all supported her</font>
<font color="cyan">in that, 100%.</font>

39
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:50,819
<font color="yellow">But you love this house,</font>
<font color="yellow">you always have!</font>

40
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:53,140
<font color="cyan">So do we!</font>
<font color="#008000">Yeah, and the kids love it here.</font>

41
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:56,020
Yes, but it's so big... just for me.

42
00:02:56,059 --> 00:02:58,980
<font color="#008000">Yeah, but this is our house too,</font>
<font color="#008000">Mum. Do we not get a say in this?</font>

43
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:01,379
None of you have lived here
for years!

44
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,700
<font color="cyan">Yeah, but we're always visiting.</font>

45
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:07,420
Look, the thing is, that I am going
to be doing a lot more travelling.

46
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:10,460
I've always wanted to see more
of the world, and so does Mark.

47
00:03:10,499 --> 00:03:13,260
<font color="#008000">Right, so this is his idea, is it?</font>
<font color="cyan">Jake, please. </font>No, no, no!

48
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,460
<font color="#008000">Well, it certainly sounds like it.</font>
<font color="cyan">Don't start.</font>

49
00:03:15,499 --> 00:03:18,020
No, it's just something I've been
thinking about for a long time,

50
00:03:18,059 --> 00:03:19,219
ever since your father died.

51
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,980
<font color="cyan">OK, well, look, how about, what if</font>
<font color="cyan">I came and I looked after the whole</font>

52
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,020
<font color="cyan">place while you were away</font>

53
00:03:23,059 --> 00:03:25,260
<font color="cyan">and then that way you don't</font>
<font color="cyan">have to sell it...</font>

54
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,460
<font color="yellow">What about Jake?</font>
<font color="yellow">I mean, he's homeless at the moment.</font>

55
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:30,020
<font color="#008000">Excuse me, I'm not homeless, Helen!</font>
<font color="#008000">What are you talking about?</font>

56
00:03:30,059 --> 00:03:31,939
<font color="#008000">I've just put the rent down</font>
<font color="#008000">on somewhere else.</font>

57
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,140
<font color="#008000">I'm not some homeless tramp</font>
<font color="#008000">on the street. </font><font color="yellow">Have you?</font>

58
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,779
No, listen! Listen, all of you!
You're not listening to me.

59
00:03:36,819 --> 00:03:39,499
I've had enough of this house
and I want to make a fresh start.

60
00:03:39,539 --> 00:03:43,860
Next week, we're going to Spain for
a few days to meet Mark's daughter.

61
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:47,059
She works out there as a doctor.
<font color="cyan">What's her name? </font>Sophie.

62
00:03:58,580 --> 00:03:59,939
And when I come back,

63
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:03,779
I want you to have all cleared
all the stuff out of your bedrooms.

64
00:04:03,819 --> 00:04:06,140
<font color="#008000">Er, well that doesn't</font>
<font color="#008000">give us much time, does it?</font>

65
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:10,460
I would like to find the whole place
tidy before we go off to India

66
00:04:10,499 --> 00:04:12,779
because the estate agents...
<font color="cyan">India?</font>

67
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:17,380
Mark and I, we've booked a six week
trip to India for my birthday treat.

68
00:04:17,419 --> 00:04:18,820
<font color="#008000">Bloody hell!</font>

69
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:21,299
<font color="yellow">Mum, you've just been in hospital.</font>
<font color="yellow">What about your health?</font>

70
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:24,979
And that is exactly why
I want to go now!

71
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,859
<font color="cyan">All right, but Mum,</font>
<font color="cyan">what if you have another attack?</font>

72
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,659
I would rather collapse and die
halfway round India

73
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:33,700
than live another 20 years
sitting here in a chair!

74
00:04:33,739 --> 00:04:35,539
<font color="#008000">You've never mentioned travel</font>
<font color="#008000">before.</font>

75
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,380
<font color="#008000">Why this sudden need</font>
<font color="#008000">to go travelling?</font>

76
00:04:37,419 --> 00:04:39,859
'Yes, I have! You don't listen,
do you?'

77
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:40,979
<font color="cyan">Yoo-hoo!</font>

78
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:43,620
<font color="#008000">'We're trying to protect you, Mum.'</font>

79
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:48,219
'From what? From living a life?
From being in love?

80
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,820
'From having adventures?

81
00:04:49,859 --> 00:04:53,140
'Oh, for God's sake, I do not want
to end up like Mary next door!

82

call of my children,

'to have some purely selfish
pleasure!'

86
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,460
Is that such a crime?

87
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:16,979
Really?

88
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:26,940
<font color="#008000">That's the last of it.</font>

89
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,060
Here you go.

90
00:05:32,979 --> 00:05:36,020
<font color="#008000">That's very kind of you.</font>
<font color="#008000">Are you not having one?</font>

91
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,900
Oh no, I have to get back to work.

92
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:41,620
Er, there are your keys, your
inventory and your contract.

93
00:05:41,659 --> 00:05:46,060
Give them a read and I'll swing by
at four to sign and collect them.

94
00:05:46,099 --> 00:05:47,940
<font color="#008000">Contract?</font>

95
00:05:47,979 --> 00:05:51,700
Yeah, we have to know where we stand
if things go pear-shaped, don't we?

96
00:05:51,739 --> 00:05:55,419
It's a six-month contract with an
option to extend, a month's notice

97
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:56,900
either side.

98
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:00,260
Payment is three personal
training sessions a week

99
00:06:00,299 --> 00:06:01,779
and two massages.

100
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,739
You prefer alternative wording?

101
00:06:05,779 --> 00:06:08,659
<font color="#008000">Er, no, no. That's fine.</font>
<font color="#008000">Erm, well thanks, Stella.</font>

102
00:06:13,099 --> 00:06:15,260
<font color="#008000">I could never've afforded</font>
<font color="#008000">anything like this,</font>

103
00:06:15,299 --> 00:06:16,659
<font color="#008000">and the kids are going to love it.</font>

104
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,859
I'll see you at four.

105
00:06:20,739 --> 00:06:22,179
<font color="#008000">See you at four.</font>

106
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:29,339
<font color="yellow">I want security to be on high alert.</font>

107
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,140
You really think she's dangerous?

108
00:06:31,179 --> 00:06:35,020
<font color="yellow">I think she is very threatening</font>
<font color="yellow">in her manner. Very.</font>

109
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,219
<font color="yellow">And then when I saw her in the pub,</font>

110
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:39,419
<font color="yellow">well, I'm sure</font>
<font color="yellow">it was no coincidence.</font>

111
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:41,419
<font color="yellow">What's her background?</font>

112
00:06:43,339 --> 00:06:47,020
She'd been with us six years
as Head of Customer Services.

113
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:50,859
Single parent, three kids.
Widowed two years ago.

114
00:06:52,419 --> 00:06:54,700
Looks like she went through a tough
time afterwards.

115
00:06:56,219 --> 00:06:58,739
<font color="yellow">Well, I didn't have much choice,</font>
<font color="yellow">did I?</font>

116
00:06:58,779 --> 00:07:02,419
<font color="yellow">Her department had been seriously</font>
<font color="yellow">under-performing for years.</font>

117
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:05,779
<font color="yellow">The board wanted redundancies,</font>
<font color="yellow">she was the obvious candidate!</font>

118
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,380
Yeah.

119
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:15,500
Helen, how are you doing?

120
00:07:16,859 --> 00:07:18,060
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

121
00:07:18,099 --> 00:07:20,940
It's a big step up for you,
this job.

122
00:07:20,979 --> 00:07:22,580
And you've had to let a lot
of staff go.

123
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,500
That can be highly stressful.

124
00:07:24,539 --> 00:07:25,979
<font color="yellow">I'm fine.</font>

125
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:29,219
OK.

126
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:31,940
Well, I'll make security aware,
then.

127
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,700
<font color="cyan">Look, I'm sorry...</font>
<font color="#008000">I'm sorry.</font>

128
00:07:37,739 --> 00:07:40,179
<font color="cyan">I shouldn't have told you</font>
<font color="cyan">on the phone, I should have waited.</font>

129
00:07:40,219 --> 00:07:41,900
<font color="#008000">I shouldn't have put the phone down</font>
<font color="#008000">on you.</font>

130
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,060
<font color="cyan">So, how are you feeling?</font>

131
00:07:45,099 --> 00:07:48,020
<font color="cyan">I... er, yeah, OK. A bit scared.</font>

132
00:07:50,419 --> 00:07:51,779
<font color="#008000">OK, hear me out.</font>

133
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:56,659
<font color="#008000">I know you're going to have it,</font>
<font color="#008000">whatever I say or do.</font>

134
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:00,460
<font color="#008000">I just, well, I know you.</font>

135
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,700
<font color="#008000">So, Nats...</font>

136
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,419
<font color="#008000">..can you give me a week?</font>

137
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,859
<font color="cyan">A week for what?</font>

138
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:11,179
<font color="#008000">I just need to sort myself out,</font>
<font color="#008000">make some big decisions.</font>

139
00:08:11,219 --> 00:08:15,940
<font color="#008000">Carla, the girls.</font>
<font color="#008000">My head's a mess right now.</font>

140
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:20,460
<font color="#008000">I've got...</font>
<font color="#008000">I've got to do the right thing...</font>

141
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,140
<font color="#008000">..by the kids at least.</font>

142
00:08:24,179 --> 00:08:25,900
<font color="#008000">And by our kid.</font>

143
00:08:28,339 --> 00:08:33,539
<font color="#008000">Take a week off work. Just sit</font>
<font color="#008000">tight, that's all I'm asking.</font>

144
00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:34,579
<font color="#008000">Please.</font>

145
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,939
<font color="#008000">Let me sort myself, Nats. OK?</font>

146
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,620
<font color="cyan">Yeah.</font>

147
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:49,260
THEY CHUCKLE

148
00:08:49,299 --> 00:08:51,020
Yeah, here we go.

149
00:08:51,059 --> 00:08:53,220
Oh!
<font color="#008000">Are you all right?</font>

150
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:55,419
Mm-hm. <font color="#008000">Mm-hm.</font>
Mm-hm.

151
00:08:55,459 --> 00:08:57,220
<font color="#008000">Careful! Careful.</font>

152
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:00,419
SHE CHUCKLES

153
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:05,100
<font color="#008000">Da-da!</font>

154
00:09:06,939 --> 00:09:08,740
Oh, wow!

155
00:09:08,779 --> 00:09:10,220
<font color="#008000">Do you like it?</font>

156
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:17,100
It's fantastic, yes.
But... why is it here?

157
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,900
<font color="#008000">It's your birthday present.</font>

158
00:09:18,939 --> 00:09:23,779
Mark, I, I, I can't accept this.
Oh, my God, it's...

159
00:09:23,819 --> 00:09:25,299
<font color="#008000">Why not?</font>

160
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:29,539
Well it... it, it's just too much!
It's just...

161
00:09:29,579 --> 00:09:32,260
<font color="#008000">Oh, God, I haven't gone too far</font>
<font color="#008000">again, have I?</font>

162
00:09:32,299 --> 00:09:35,900
Mark, I can't accept a car!

163
00:09:35,939 --> 00:09:39,140
<font color="#008000">But Viv, why not? It's only money!</font>

164
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:42,620
<font color="#008000">At my age, all you can do</font>
<font color="#008000">is spend it...</font>

165
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:48,340
<font color="#008000">..on making someone I love happy.</font>

166
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,699
<font color="#008000">OK, let's go for a spin!</font>

167
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,659
Mark, Mark, it's just that it's...

168
00:09:54,699 --> 00:09:57,659
<font color="#008000">Come on, come on, come on.</font>
<font color="#008000">You're going to enjoy this.</font>

169
00:09:57,699 --> 00:09:59,819
<font color="#008000">Or, not love it.</font>

170
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,380
<font color="#008000">I'll drive, shall I,</font>
<font color="#008000">to start with?</font>

171
00:10:01,419 --> 00:10:03,020
Yes, you drive!

172
00:10:03,059 --> 00:10:06,100
<font color="#008000">It's the perfect day for a drive</font>

173
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:09,059
<font color="#008000">and I found a great little place</font>
<font color="#008000">for lunch you're going to love.</font>

174
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,260
OK.

175
00:10:12,419 --> 00:10:14,699
<font color="#008000">Let's go, let's go!</font>

176
00:10:17,779 --> 00:10:20,659
What was your relationship
with your neighbour, Mrs Bennett?

177
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:25,900
<font color="cyan">Erm, well, Mary had lived next door</font>
<font color="cyan">to us since... forever.</font>

178
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:29,500
<font color="#008000">Yoo-hoo! Vivien?</font>

179
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,699
<font color="cyan">She'd had a baby boy years ago</font>

180
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:37,179
<font color="cyan">around the same time</font>
<font color="cyan">that mum had Jake. But...</font>

181
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,539
<font color="cyan">..he died, unfortunately.</font>

182
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,419
<font color="cyan">And then when her husband</font>
<font color="cyan">walked out on her,</font>

183
00:10:52,459 --> 00:10:54,860
<font color="cyan">we did our best to include her</font>
<font color="cyan">in our life.</font>

184
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:02,699
<font color="cyan">When we were kids, she looked after</font>
<font color="cyan">us when mum was at work.</font>

185
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:06,179
<font color="cyan">You know, cooking meals,</font>
<font color="cyan">helping us with our homework.</font>

186
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,819
<font color="cyan">That, that kind of thing.</font>

187
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:12,059
So she was more than a neighbour?
More like part of the family?

188
00:11:24,939 --> 00:11:29,140
<font color="cyan">Yeah, I don't know what we would</font>
<font color="cyan">have done without her, actually.</font>

189
00:11:29,179 --> 00:11:32,659
Which is why she was with you
on the night of the, er,

190
00:11:32,699 --> 00:11:35,020
on the night of the celebration?

191
00:11:35,059 --> 00:11:37,900
<font color="cyan">Yeah. She's just like one of us.</font>

192
00:11:50,924 --> 00:11:52,725
<font color="yellow">Hello!</font>

193
00:11:52,764 --> 00:11:55,764
<font color="yellow">Just getting out the crabgrass</font>
<font color="yellow">before it takes hold.</font>

194
00:11:55,804 --> 00:11:58,085
<font color="yellow">Dreadful stuff.</font>
Oh, right. Thank you, Mary.

195
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:00,924
<font color="yellow">It's quite something, isn't it?</font>
<font color="yellow">It's lovely!</font>

196
00:12:00,965 --> 00:12:04,884
Yeah, it's, erm, it was a present,
way too extravagant.

197
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:07,845
<font color="#008000">Nonsense. She deserves to be spoilt,</font>
<font color="#008000">doesn't she, Mary?</font>

198
00:12:07,884 --> 00:12:10,845
<font color="yellow">Yeah. Yeah, of course she does.</font>

199
00:12:10,884 --> 00:12:12,644
<font color="yellow">I didn't realise that...</font>

200
00:12:12,684 --> 00:12:16,884
Oh! I, I meant to mention it to you,
I'm... I should have said.

201
00:12:16,924 --> 00:12:19,365
<font color="#008000">Darling, we're late already.</font>
<font color="#008000">We should get going.</font>

202
00:12:19,404 --> 00:12:22,565
Yes, all right. Yes.
<font color="#008000">Why don't you drive this time?</font>

203
00:12:23,605 --> 00:12:24,684
We'll chat later.

204
00:12:42,725 --> 00:12:44,884
<font color="#008000">Top floor. It's open, come up.</font>

205
00:12:44,924 --> 00:12:47,284
<font color="#008000">Yeah, Leila and I have been pretty</font>
<font color="#008000">good, actually.</font>

206
00:12:47,325 --> 00:12:49,924
<font color="#008000">She's started talking</font>
<font color="#008000">to me again, which is progress.</font>

207
00:12:49,965 --> 00:12:52,085
<font color="yellow">Yeah, it's good.</font>

208
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:53,684
<font color="yellow">Hey, this sofa isn't yours, is it?</font>

209
00:12:53,725 --> 00:12:55,924
<font color="#008000">Er, no, no. It comes part furnished.</font>

210
00:12:55,965 --> 00:12:57,365
<font color="yellow">Well, don't let the kids ruin it.</font>

211
00:12:57,404 --> 00:12:58,804
<font color="#008000">Well, they're not animals!</font>

212
00:12:58,845 --> 00:13:01,125
<font color="cyan">Happy housewarming!</font>
<font color="#008000">Hey!</font>

213
00:13:01,164 --> 00:13:03,125
<font color="yellow">Hi!</font>

214
00:13:03,164 --> 00:13:05,644
<font color="cyan">Bloody hell, this is amazing!</font>
<font color="cyan">Must have cost a fortune!</font>

215
00:13:05,684 --> 00:13:07,605
<font color="yellow">That's what I said!</font>
<font color="#008000">Well, it doesn't, so...</font>

216
00:13:07,644 --> 00:13:09,205
<font color="yellow">Mates rates, apparently.</font>

217
00:13:09,245 --> 00:13:11,684
<font color="#008000">Yes, it's a friend at the gym</font>
<font color="#008000">who's away for few months.</font>

218
00:13:11,725 --> 00:13:14,044
<font color="cyan">Hello! </font>Hi!
<font color="cyan">Course. No George?</font>

219
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:15,365
He's down the pub, he's in a mood.

220
00:13:15,404 --> 00:13:17,605
<font color="yellow">He's not in a mood!</font>

221
00:13:17,644 --> 00:13:20,044
<font color="yellow">He just fancied a quiet hour</font>
<font color="yellow">with the papers.</font>

222
00:13:20,085 --> 00:13:21,884
<font color="yellow">We're not joined at the hip.</font>

223
00:13:23,684 --> 00:13:26,445
Excuse me,
do you mind if I sit here?

224
00:13:26,485 --> 00:13:27,725
<font color="cyan">Er, yeah, yeah.</font>

225
00:13:27,764 --> 00:13:29,924
It's just a bit noisy round there.

226
00:13:29,965 --> 00:13:31,845
<font color="cyan">No problem.</font>
Thanks.

227
00:13:35,245 --> 00:13:37,044
<font color="#008000">Hi, Mum. It's open, come on up.</font>

228
00:13:37,085 --> 00:13:40,085
<font color="cyan">Did she tell you about the car?</font>
<font color="yellow">I know! It's unbelievable.</font>

229
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:42,044
<font color="cyan">I mean, at least we know</font>
<font color="cyan">he's solvent, I suppose.</font>

230
00:13:42,085 --> 00:13:44,205
<font color="yellow">Yeah, but it's a bit OTT.</font>

231
00:13:44,245 --> 00:13:45,725
<font color="#008000">Yeah, I don't like it.</font>

232
00:13:45,764 --> 00:13:48,725
<font color="#008000">Showering her with gifts</font>
<font color="#008000">and foreign trips? Not normal.</font>

233
00:13:48,764 --> 00:13:51,085
<font color="cyan">Well, maybe he just wants</font>
<font color="cyan">to spoil her? It has been heard of.</font>

234
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:53,725
<font color="#008000">No, it's too much.</font>
<font color="#008000">I mean, what is he after?</font>

235
00:13:53,764 --> 00:13:56,644
Hi! <font color="#008000">Hey! </font><font color="cyan">Hey!</font>
<font color="#008000">Welcome!</font>

236
00:13:56,684 --> 00:13:59,044
'Would you say you were a close
family? <font color="cyan">I think so, yeah.'</font>

237
00:13:59,085 --> 00:14:00,924
<font color="#008000">Oh, thanks for the champagne.</font>

238
00:14:02,164 --> 00:14:04,524
In times of trouble,
you'd all stick together?

239
00:14:06,004 --> 00:14:09,164
<font color="cyan">Yeah. Well, erm,</font>
<font color="cyan">that's what families do, isn't it?</font>

240
00:14:09,205 --> 00:14:10,804
<font color="yellow">'Jake, can we have a word?'</font>

241
00:14:10,845 --> 00:14:12,684
<font color="#008000">OK.</font>

242
00:14:12,725 --> 00:14:15,365
<font color="yellow">Look, I'm aware that we didn't</font>
<font color="yellow">get off on the right foot</font>

243
00:14:15,404 --> 00:14:18,245
<font color="yellow">the last time we met,</font>
<font color="yellow">so I just wanted to say...</font>

244
00:14:18,284 --> 00:14:20,125
<font color="#008000">Yeah, I know. It's nothing personal.</font>

245
00:14:20,164 --> 00:14:22,404
<font color="#008000">We just don't want Mum</font>
<font color="#008000">to rush into anything.</font>

246
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:24,365
<font color="#008000">Dad's only been gone 18 months.</font>

247
00:14:24,404 --> 00:14:26,125
<font color="yellow">Yeah, I know that.</font>

248
00:14:26,164 --> 00:14:27,845
<font color="yellow">And I wanted to reassure you</font>

249
00:14:27,884 --> 00:14:31,125
<font color="yellow">that your mother is under absolutely</font>
<font color="yellow">no pressure from me.</font>

250
00:14:31,164 --> 00:14:34,325
<font color="#008000">OK. But you did just buy her</font>
<font color="#008000">a flash car</font>

251
00:14:34,365 --> 00:14:36,325
<font color="#008000">and move into her house</font>
<font color="#008000">so you can play doctor.</font>

252
00:14:36,365 --> 00:14:37,684
MARK CHUCKLES

253
00:14:37,725 --> 00:14:39,245
<font color="yellow">Moving in was her idea.</font>

254
00:14:39,284 --> 00:14:41,404
<font color="yellow">And it's only a temporary measure,</font>

255
00:14:41,445 --> 00:14:42,845
<font color="yellow">to make sure she recovers</font>
<font color="yellow">her health.</font>

256
00:14:42,884 --> 00:14:44,524
<font color="#008000">And the car? The trip to Spain?</font>

257
00:14:44,565 --> 00:14:46,485
<font color="yellow">We're going to see my daughter!</font>

258
00:14:46,524 --> 00:14:49,644
<font color="yellow">And the car isn't a flash car,</font>
<font color="yellow">it's just a fun thing.</font>

259
00:14:49,684 --> 00:14:51,884
<font color="#008000">And selling the house</font>
<font color="#008000">we've lived in all of our lives?</font>

260
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:56,245
<font color="yellow">Oh, come on!</font>
<font color="yellow">She is an individual, you know.</font>

261
00:14:56,284 --> 00:14:58,845
<font color="yellow">She doesn't exist</font>
<font color="yellow">just to parent you lot!</font>

262
00:15:01,004 --> 00:15:03,004
<font color="#008000">Is that so?</font>
Dad! <font color="#008000">Yeah?</font>

263
00:15:03,044 --> 00:15:04,605
Mum was on the phone.

264
00:15:04,644 --> 00:15:06,965
Can she collect us now?
She's on her way back from lunch.

265
00:15:07,004 --> 00:15:10,565
<font color="#008000">Yeah, sure.</font>
<font color="cyan">With a man! </font><font color="#008000">What?</font>

266
00:15:10,605 --> 00:15:12,284
You idiot!

267
00:15:15,524 --> 00:15:16,804
<font color="#008000">What man?</font>

268
00:15:16,845 --> 00:15:18,205
Oh, wow! That's amazing.

269
00:15:18,245 --> 00:15:20,725
<font color="cyan">Well, when I've finished</font>
<font color="cyan">with the ground floor,</font>

270
00:15:20,764 --> 00:15:24,085
<font color="cyan">I'm going to move upstairs,</font>
<font color="cyan">where I'm going to rip out</font>

271
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:25,245
<font color="cyan">an old bathroom,</font>

<font color="cyan">master suite.</font>

273
00:15:28,205 --> 00:15:31,004
Wow, that's impressive.

274
00:15:31,044 --> 00:15:35,524
I mean, that sounds like
the work of a professional builder.

275
00:15:35,565 --> 00:15:36,924
<font color="cyan">Oh, no! No, no, no.</font>

276
00:15:36,965 --> 00:15:41,284
<font color="cyan">All self-taught, but, er, you know,</font>
<font color="cyan">you pick things up.</font>

277
00:15:41,325 --> 00:15:44,004
<font color="cyan">You can Google almost everything</font>
<font color="cyan">these days.</font>

278
00:15:44,044 --> 00:15:48,365
<font color="cyan">Yeah, yeah, I even, er,</font>
<font color="cyan">even rewired the place myself, so...</font>

279
00:15:48,404 --> 00:15:50,764
Really? <font color="cyan">Yeah.</font>

280
00:15:50,804 --> 00:15:52,804
It's quite an achievement.

281
00:15:52,845 --> 00:15:56,004
I mean, to renovate a whole house
singlehandedly!

282
00:15:56,044 --> 00:15:59,404
<font color="cyan">Oh, I mean, I don't know,</font>
<font color="cyan">it's, it's...</font>

283
00:15:59,445 --> 00:16:01,804
<font color="cyan">Can I get you a-another...?</font>

284
00:16:01,845 --> 00:16:03,764
Hm. <font color="cyan">Yeah?</font>

285
00:16:03,804 --> 00:16:05,965
<font color="cyan">Same again?</font>
Thank you!

286
00:16:06,004 --> 00:16:07,205
<font color="cyan">OK.</font>

287
00:16:11,524 --> 00:16:13,365
'What about your private lives?'

288
00:16:16,884 --> 00:16:19,044
'Is it fair to say
they're in some turmoil?'

289
00:16:21,205 --> 00:16:23,884
<font color="yellow">OK, girls, lunch is ready.</font>
<font color="yellow">Out you get!</font>

290
00:16:23,924 --> 00:16:25,804
<font color="#008000">Right, first one to swim to Dad.</font>

291
00:16:25,845 --> 00:16:26,845
<font color="#008000">Caught a fly...</font>

292
00:16:26,884 --> 00:16:29,884
<font color="cyan">Well, my brother and sister were</font>
<font color="cyan">having marital problems,</font>

293
00:16:29,924 --> 00:16:31,164
<font color="cyan">if that's what you mean?</font>

294
00:16:31,205 --> 00:16:32,605
Hm.

295
00:16:35,485 --> 00:16:36,845
And you?

296
00:16:36,884 --> 00:16:38,004
<font color="cyan">'Me?'</font>

297
00:16:38,044 --> 00:16:39,485
<font color="#008000">Swim to Daddy.</font>

298
00:16:39,524 --> 00:16:42,044
<font color="cyan">'Oh, no. No, no. No.</font>

299
00:16:42,085 --> 00:16:44,684
<font color="cyan">'No-one special.'</font>
<font color="#008000">Aah!</font>

300
00:16:48,325 --> 00:16:49,684
WHISPERS: <font color="cyan">Shit!</font>

301
00:16:49,725 --> 00:16:51,884
<font color="cyan">'Well, fortunately,</font>
<font color="cyan">being single, for me,</font>

302
00:16:51,924 --> 00:16:53,605
<font color="cyan">life's a lot less complicated.</font>

303
00:16:58,205 --> 00:17:01,404
It could be a physical problem
or an emotional one.

304
00:17:01,444 --> 00:17:04,924
You see, our relationship
with our libido,

305
00:17:04,964 --> 00:17:07,125
it's a very complicated thing.

306
00:17:07,164 --> 00:17:10,204
Can I ask you, George,
do you ever masturbate?

307
00:17:13,684 --> 00:17:17,204
<font color="cyan">Er, well, you know,</font>
<font color="cyan">occasionally...</font>

308
00:17:18,325 --> 00:17:21,924
<font color="yellow">So, then there can't be anything</font>
<font color="yellow">physically wrong with him,</font>

309
00:17:21,964 --> 00:17:23,244
<font color="yellow">can there?</font>

310
00:17:23,285 --> 00:17:24,565
Is there anything, erm, George,

311
00:17:24,605 --> 00:17:26,845
on your mind right now
that you might think

312
00:17:26,884 --> 00:17:29,644
accounts for your lack
of desire?

313
00:17:31,724 --> 00:17:37,444
<font color="cyan">Er, well, erm, well,</font>
<font color="cyan">Helen's out at work all day,</font>

314
00:17:37,484 --> 00:17:38,765
<font color="cyan">often late home.</font>

315
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:43,644
<font color="cyan">I'm working on the house,</font>
<font color="cyan">looking after Lily.</font>

316
00:17:43,684 --> 00:17:48,765
<font color="cyan">I guess we've just drifted apart.</font>

317
00:17:48,805 --> 00:17:52,365
Hm. Yes, you see, in my experience,
it's about intimacy.

318
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,164
It's about communication.

319
00:17:54,204 --> 00:17:55,765
Isn't it?

320
00:17:58,005 --> 00:17:59,404
Right, so, erm,

321
00:18:00,444 --> 00:18:03,805
what I propose is that
we take sex off the agenda

322
00:18:03,845 --> 00:18:05,964
and start talking to each other.

323
00:18:06,005 --> 00:18:07,565
Is that acceptable to you?

324
00:18:07,605 --> 00:18:09,204
Helen?
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

325
00:18:09,244 --> 00:18:10,444
George?

326
00:18:10,484 --> 00:18:11,845
<font color="cyan">Yep.</font>

327
00:18:11,884 --> 00:18:13,845
Great.

328
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:15,204
<font color="#008000">The thing is, kids need to feel</font>

329
00:18:15,244 --> 00:18:18,204
<font color="#008000">that their parents can be trusted,</font>
<font color="#008000">don't they? Relied on, united.</font>

330
00:18:18,244 --> 00:18:19,724
<font color="#008000">What are they going to think</font>

331
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,924
<font color="#008000">if their mum starts dating</font>
<font color="#008000">other people?</font>

332
00:18:21,964 --> 00:18:23,484
<font color="#008000">Well, yes, we had an agreement.</font>

333
00:18:23,525 --> 00:18:25,444
<font color="#008000">Yes, it was</font>
<font color="#008000">a six month break.</font>

334
00:18:25,484 --> 00:18:26,805
<font color="#008000">Yes, but there was only a break</font>

335
00:18:26,845 --> 00:18:29,045
<font color="#008000">so I could get the money together</font>
<font color="#008000">to pay her back.</font>

336
00:18:29,085 --> 00:18:31,045
<font color="#008000">There was nothing</font>
<font color="#008000">about seeing other people.</font>

337
00:18:31,085 --> 00:18:34,924
Look, if you want her back,
it's really simple.

338
00:18:34,964 --> 00:18:37,085
<font color="#008000">Is it? Go on.</font>

339
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:38,924
Well, firstly, apologise.

340
00:18:38,964 --> 00:18:43,325
I mean, men never apologise enough
when they've fucked it up.

341
00:18:43,365 --> 00:18:47,565
Then say how that you understand
how awful it must have been for her.

342
00:18:48,724 --> 00:18:51,404
You know,
express real, abject remorse.

343
00:18:51,444 --> 00:18:53,125
Then ask her how she's feeling.

344
00:18:53,164 --> 00:18:57,204
And listen, you know, even if
it takes all night, you listen.

345
00:18:57,244 --> 00:18:59,085
You just listen,
you don't interrupt...

346
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:03,125
With your full attention, OK?
For as long as it takes.

347
00:19:03,164 --> 00:19:04,444
<font color="#008000">Bloody hell.</font>

348
00:19:04,484 --> 00:19:05,964
SHE LAUGHS

349
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:09,765
Then tell her you miss her.

350
00:19:09,805 --> 00:19:12,805
Not the kids. Just her.

351
00:19:14,845 --> 00:19:16,204
<font color="#008000">Really? What, and that's it?</font>

352
00:19:16,244 --> 00:19:19,884
Yeah! More or less. Come on!

00:21:09,204 --> 00:21:11,765
<font color="cyan">But I think I'd know</font>
<font color="cyan">if anything was wrong anyway.</font>

392
00:21:11,805 --> 00:21:15,325
<font color="#008000">OK, Nats. Look, be strong.</font>

393
00:21:15,365 --> 00:21:18,805
<font color="#008000">I'm going to be out of there</font>
<font color="#008000">within the week, I promise you.</font>

394
00:21:18,845 --> 00:21:21,005
<font color="cyan">Five years I've been waiting</font>
<font color="cyan">for you, all right.</font>

395
00:21:21,045 --> 00:21:23,565
<font color="cyan">How much longer do I have to wait?</font>
<font color="cyan">Until your wife kills me?</font>

396
00:21:23,605 --> 00:21:25,164
<font color="#008000">Nats, for God's sake!</font>

397
00:21:25,204 --> 00:21:27,845
<font color="cyan">Then you'd never have to tell her</font>
<font color="cyan">you were leaving her, would you?</font>

398
00:21:27,884 --> 00:21:30,765
Would you describe your family
as hot-tempered?

399
00:21:32,805 --> 00:21:34,365
<font color="cyan">No. Not especially, no.</font>

400
00:21:34,404 --> 00:21:38,005
<font color="cyan">I mean, we, we have differences</font>
<font color="cyan">of opinion, obviously.</font>

401
00:21:38,045 --> 00:21:41,285
Hm. And on the night
of the incident...

402
00:21:42,684 --> 00:21:44,484
..had there been a difference
of opinion?

403
00:21:46,045 --> 00:21:48,765
<font color="cyan">No. Not that I can recall.</font>

404
00:21:51,484 --> 00:21:53,484
<font color="cyan">You know, I mean,</font>
<font color="cyan">it was a celebration.</font>

405
00:21:54,565 --> 00:21:55,964
Hm.

406
00:21:57,724 --> 00:21:59,045
<font color="yellow">Night, Mum.</font>

407
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:52,220
<font color="yellow">That's awful, that's awful. OK.</font>
<font color="yellow">Well, look, you'd better go now.</font>

408
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:55,099
<font color="yellow">Er, I'll talk to you,</font>
<font color="yellow">I'll talk to you as soon as I can.</font>

409
00:22:55,139 --> 00:22:58,619
<font color="yellow">You mind yourself, OK?</font>
<font color="yellow">All right, lots of love.</font>

410
00:22:58,659 --> 00:23:01,339
<font color="yellow">Bye. Bye, bye, bye, bye.</font>

411
00:23:01,379 --> 00:23:03,819
What is it? What's wrong?

412
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:07,659
<font color="yellow">She's not able to make it.</font>
<font color="yellow">There's been a train crash.</font>

<font color="yellow">looking forward to meeting you.</font>

417
00:23:19,419 --> 00:23:22,899
Well, I mean, maybe tomorrow?
We're here for a couple of days.

<font color="yellow">Brutal, isn't it?</font>

420
00:23:27,379 --> 00:23:29,980
<font color="yellow">And bloody annoying, too.</font>

<font color="yellow">We've come all this way!</font>

422
00:23:31,379 --> 00:23:34,780
Come on, she's saving lives.

423
00:23:34,819 --> 00:23:38,260
A little more important than meeting
her dad's new girlfriend.

424
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:41,500
<font color="yellow">But I so wanted you to meet her.</font>

425
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:43,500
It's fine.

426
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:46,180
More sightseeing,

427
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:48,220
long lunch...

428
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,579
<font color="yellow">Siesta?</font>

429
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,099
We'll have a lovely time.

430
00:23:53,139 --> 00:23:54,619
<font color="yellow">And tomorrow...</font>

431

<font color="yellow">to Gibraltar, you know?</font>

432
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:36,460
I'll er, I'll set the alarm for
seven, shall I?

433
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:40,220
The book says it's a two hour drive.

434
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:44,819
<font color="yellow">Are you sure about this?</font>

435
00:24:44,859 --> 00:24:46,859
<font color="yellow">Absolutely sure?</font>

436
00:24:46,899 --> 00:24:49,020
It was my idea!

<font color="#008000">Hey, Mary. How are you?</font>

455
00:26:48,099 --> 00:26:49,379
All right.

456
00:26:49,419 --> 00:26:51,740
<font color="#008000">Erm, could I leave these with you</font>
<font color="#008000">for a few weeks?</font>

457
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:53,379
Course you can.

458
00:26:53,419 --> 00:26:54,780
<font color="#008000">Thanks.</font>

459
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:59,659
How are things? With, with Leila.

460
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:06,460
<font color="#008000">Er... Yeah. I think we're getting</font>
<font color="#008000">there. I think. Hope.</font>

461
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,419
Good. I always said she's very lucky
to have you.

462
00:27:10,899 --> 00:27:14,020
<font color="#008000">Well, I don't know about that,</font>

00:27:17,059 --> 00:27:18,260
It's fine, it's fine.

465
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:22,859
Such a shame though,
that your mum's moving, isn't it?

466
00:27:22,899 --> 00:27:24,379
<font color="#008000">Yeah, but it's not done yet, Mary,</font>

467
00:27:24,419 --> 00:27:26,659
<font color="#008000">cos we've still got time</font>
<font color="#008000">to turn that ship around.</font>

468
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:30,220
I don't know about that. Not if
her new car's anything to go by!

469
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:32,619
He's obviously done well
for himself, hasn't he?

470
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:36,700
<font color="#008000">It's a bit too flashy for my liking.</font>

471
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:40,300
Although... I suppose he could have
bought it on credit,

472
00:27:40,339 --> 00:27:41,899
I suppose, couldn't he?

473
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:44,500
<font color="#008000">What?</font>

474
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:47,059
Well, people do, don't they,
these days? Buy now, pay later!

475
00:27:47,099 --> 00:27:48,859
Whereas we always had to save up
for things.

476
00:27:48,899 --> 00:27:51,379
Anyway, get your bags,
I'll put the kettle on.

477
00:27:55,460 --> 00:28:01,180
<font color="yellow">OK, well, thanks.</font>

<font color="#008000">I never wanted to hurt you.</font>

524
00:30:13,339 --> 00:30:15,899
Maybe, but that's what
it feels like.

525
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:20,220
Thousands and thousands of pounds,
gambling.

526
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:23,700
I mean, never mind me, Jake,
but how could you do that?

527
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:25,460
How could you do that to our kids?

528
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,740
Make them homeless...

529
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:29,059
<font color="#008000">No, they're not...</font>
<font color="#008000">they're not homeless!</font>

530
00:30:29,099 --> 00:30:30,379
Thanks to my mum, Jake!

531
00:30:30,419 --> 00:30:32,740
It's the worst kind of betrayal.

532
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:35,180
It's even worse
than you having an affair.

00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:41,980
<font color="#008000">The kids said you are seeing</font>
<font color="#008000">someone else.</font>

536
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:43,899
Oh, my God!

537
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:46,099
<font color="#008000">And we told them that this was</font>
<font color="#008000">a temporary solution</font>

538
00:30:46,139 --> 00:30:48,899
<font color="#008000">and that we would be getting back</font>
<font color="#008000">together eventually, didn't we?</font>

539
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:50,540
You told them that, not me.

540

<font color="#008000">Who is it, Leila?</font>

541
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:54,460
It is none of your business!
I think I'd better go.

542
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:55,740
<font color="#008000">No, no, no! It is my business,</font>

543

00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:59,180
Get off me.

on me again...

Helen, maybe I should suggest...

649
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:24,020
<font color="yellow">So is it true, George, that</font>
<font color="yellow">you're having an affair? Yes or no?</font>

650
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:27,140
<font color="cyan">No! It's utter bollocks!</font>

651
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:31,180
<font color="yellow">Well, that's, that's funny,</font>
<font color="yellow">because I've got a photo here of you</font>

652
00:36:31,219 --> 00:36:35,419
<font color="yellow">in the pub on Sunday, taken by her.</font>
<font color="yellow">Isn't that you, George?</font>

653
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:36,779
Helen, I really don't think...

654
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:38,620
<font color="cyan">Well, I mean, yeah that's-</font>
<font color="cyan">yes, that's me.</font>

655
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:40,620
<font color="cyan">But I can assure you,</font>
<font color="cyan">I'm not having an affair!</font>

656
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:43,419
<font color="yellow">What do you think, Jon?</font>
<font color="yellow">True or false? Can I trust him?</font>

657
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:45,379
Well, look,
I think we should just...

658
00:36:45,419 --> 00:36:47,100
<font color="yellow">I mean, we'll never know, will we?</font>

659
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:49,660
<font color="yellow">Cos at the end of the day</font>
<font color="yellow">it's her word against yours,</font>

660
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:50,859
<font color="yellow">whoever she is.</font>

661
00:36:50,899 --> 00:36:52,060
<font color="cyan">All I did was chat to her!</font>

662
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:57,819
<font color="yellow">Oh, really? Just, just chatting</font>
<font color="yellow">was it? I mean, who is she?</font>

663
00:36:57,859 --> 00:37:00,140
Look, if we just take
a deep breath... <font color="yellow">Oh, shut up!</font>

664
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:02,140
<font color="cyan">I have no bloody idea!</font>

665
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:05,339
<font color="yellow">Oh, really? So the whole thing's</font>
<font color="yellow">just a figment of her imagination?</font>

666
00:37:05,379 --> 00:37:07,020
<font color="yellow">And you're just an innocent bloke</font>

667
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:09,219
<font color="yellow">having a chat with an unknown woman</font>
<font color="yellow">in a pub?</font>

668
00:37:09,259 --> 00:37:12,419
<font color="cyan">Yes! Helen, for Christ's sake!</font>
<font color="yellow">All right, then, prove it!</font>

669
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:14,299
<font color="yellow">Bring me the woman</font>
<font color="yellow">who sent this picture</font>

670
00:37:14,339 --> 00:37:17,100
<font color="yellow">and let me hear her tell me</font>
<font color="yellow">that she's never slept with you!</font>

671
00:37:35,259 --> 00:37:37,020
<font color="#008000">Has Mummy seen her new friend again?</font>

672
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:40,100
Last night.

673
00:37:41,379 --> 00:37:43,219
<font color="#008000">Oh, right.</font>

674
00:37:44,819 --> 00:37:46,140
<font color="#008000">Have you met him?</font>

675
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:49,419
We saw him in the car. He waved.

676
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:54,020
<font color="#008000">Ah, he waved.</font>
<font color="#008000">Ah, that's nice, that's nice.</font>

677
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:59,419
<font color="#008000">Was Mummy wearing her lipstick?</font>

678
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:02,299
<font color="#008000">She was?</font>

679
00:38:12,819 --> 00:38:14,140
<font color="cyan">Right, I'll catch you up.</font>

680
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:15,419
OK.

681
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,939
<font color="cyan">Mary?</font>

682
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:22,020
<font color="cyan">Can I just ask you a favour?</font>
<font color="cyan">It's about Mum.</font>

683
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:23,339
<font color="yellow">Is she, is she all right?</font>

684
00:38:23,379 --> 00:38:25,540
<font color="yellow">She's still in Spain</font>
<font color="yellow">with her boyfriend, isn't she?</font>

685
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:28,540
<font color="cyan">Yes, er, only he's not</font>
<font color="cyan">the boyfriend anymore.</font>

686
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:31,939
<font color="cyan">He's now the husband.</font>
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

687
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:33,700
<font color="cyan">Yep. They just got married</font>
<font color="cyan">in Gibraltar.</font>

688
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:38,259
<font color="cyan">I know. We all feel the same.</font>

689
00:38:38,299 --> 00:38:41,219
<font color="cyan">Look, do you mind just keeping</font>
<font color="cyan">an eye on her when she gets back?</font>

690
00:38:41,259 --> 00:38:44,660
<font color="cyan">Erm, we're all just a bit concerned</font>
<font color="cyan">because it's happened so fast.</font>

691
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,700
<font color="yellow">Course I will. Of course.</font>

692
00:38:46,739 --> 00:38:52,580
<font color="cyan">Yeah, just, er, call me if-</font>
<font color="cyan">if anything's not quite right.</font>

693
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:54,100
<font color="cyan">Thanks, Mary.</font>

694
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:01,819
<font color="cyan">All right?</font>

695
00:39:01,859 --> 00:39:04,339
Yeah.

696
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:12,180
<font color="yellow">Natalie?</font>

697
00:39:12,219 --> 00:39:14,180
<font color="yellow">I was just wondering,</font>

698
00:39:14,219 --> 00:39:15,620
<font color="yellow">what did his first wife die of?</font>

699
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:35,779
MARY SOBS

700
00:40:39,899 --> 00:40:42,939
<font color="#008000">I messed up with Leila.</font>
I'm sorry.

701
00:40:44,219 --> 00:40:48,500
<font color="#008000">I haven't had a drink or laid a bet</font>
<font color="#008000">for nine weeks now.</font>

702
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:52,180
<font color="#008000">And I'm working all the hours</font>
<font color="#008000">I can to pay her back,</font>

703
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:54,700
<font color="#008000">and still...</font>

704
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:57,859
<font color="#008000">..still...</font>

705
00:40:59,739 --> 00:41:02,500
<font color="#008000">..I can't quite get it right.</font>

706
00:41:08,899 --> 00:41:11,379
<font color="#008000">I love my kids. They're my world.</font>

707
00:41:11,419 --> 00:41:15,259
<font color="#008000">Do you know, that's why I started</font>
<font color="#008000">gambling in the first place?</font>

708
00:41:15,299 --> 00:41:16,899
<font color="#008000">Because I wanted more for them.</font>

709
00:41:18,299 --> 00:41:19,339
<font color="#008000">It's just...</font>

710
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:23,540
<font color="#008000">God, it's so fucking stupid.</font>

711
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:27,339
<font color="#008000">Mm.</font>

712
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:33,259
<font color="#008000">Anyway, ah. Sorry.</font>
<font color="#008000">You don't need to hear all this.</font>

713
00:41:33,299 --> 00:41:34,980
<font color="#008000">This is not why I'm here.</font>

714
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:36,379
<font color="#008000">This is work.</font>

715
00:41:38,339 --> 00:41:41,020
Er, look, I've been hurt before.

716
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:44,899
Oh, and I have fucked up badly,
believe me.

717
00:41:44,939 --> 00:41:47,140
I mean, that's why these days,
that I...

718
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:51,859
I pay for sex. But, look,
I completely understand.

719
00:41:51,899 --> 00:41:53,580
<font color="#008000">Thanks.</font>

720
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:01,939
It turns out,
Gibraltar is one of the few places

721
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:05,100
where you can just
get married these days.

722
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:06,379
<font color="#008000">Luckily for us.</font>

723
00:42:06,419 --> 00:42:08,540
THEY CHUCKLE

724
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:10,779
It's all down to the India trip,
really.

725
00:42:10,819 --> 00:42:14,020
I mean, if there was any kind
of emergency when we're away,

726
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:17,980
then it would just be easier
if we are each other's next of kin.

727
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:21,259
<font color="#008000">So if any decisions need to be made</font>
<font color="#008000">about our health or anything,</font>

728
00:42:21,299 --> 00:42:23,460
<font color="#008000">they can be made straight away,</font>
<font color="#008000">without the delay</font>

729
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,899
<font color="#008000">of trying to get hold</font>
<font color="#008000">of our kids back in Europe.</font>

730
00:42:25,939 --> 00:42:26,939
<font color="yellow">Ah.</font>

731
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:30,299
I mean, we might be
in some remote part of the country,

732
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:32,980
so it just...
it's a practical solution.

733
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:35,980
<font color="yellow">And a little bit romantic too.</font>

734
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:39,500
And a little bit romantic too.

735
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:45,020
<font color="yellow">OK, I'll go and get the steaks</font>
<font color="yellow">and start cooking.</font>

736
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:53,259
<font color="#008000">What were you thinking?</font>
<font color="yellow">I thought you were anti-marriage?</font>

737
00:42:53,299 --> 00:42:55,580
<font color="cyan">Well, you might at least</font>
<font color="cyan">have discussed it with us first!</font>

738
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:56,859
<font color="yellow">Yes, why didn't you tell us?</font>

739
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:01,379
Well, it was just on
the spur of the moment.

740
00:43:01,419 --> 00:43:04,259
<font color="#008000">Right, but do we not have</font>
<font color="#008000">a right to know?</font>

741
00:43:04,299 --> 00:43:07,299
<font color="#008000">This is a huge, decision, Mum.</font>
<font color="cyan">Yeah.</font>

742
00:43:07,339 --> 00:43:11,540
It may be a big decision for you,
but not so much for me.

743
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:15,140
I mean, it's not even
a lifetime's commitment.

744
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:17,180
I've had most of my mine!

745
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:20,020
Look, I'm nearly 70,
and I've had a health scare,

746
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:22,980
so, I mean, you know, why not?

747
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:26,819
<font color="cyan">All right, but why did you have to</font>
<font color="cyan">do it the day before Dad's birthday?</font>

748
00:43:26,859 --> 00:43:28,700
<font color="#008000">Yeah!</font>

749
00:43:28,739 --> 00:43:31,020
Oh, I...

750
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:33,500
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'd completely forgotten.

751
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:37,060
<font color="#008000">Oh, right, OK. You forgot.</font>
<font color="#008000">After 45 years of marriage?</font>

752
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:38,819
<font color="yellow">What about your independence?</font>

753
00:43:38,859 --> 00:43:40,020
<font color="cyan">Yeah. </font><font color="yellow">You said you-</font>

754
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:41,739
<font color="yellow">you were loving being</font>
<font color="yellow">free at last.</font>

755
00:43:41,779 --> 00:43:43,939
<font color="#008000">Yeah. He's talked you into this,</font>
<font color="#008000">didn't he?</font>

756
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:46,580
<font color="cyan">And now you're just back where you</font>
<font color="cyan">were! </font><font color="#008000">And you hardly know him!</font>

757
00:43:47,899 --> 00:43:51,339
Are any of you just the tiniest bit
happy for me?

758
00:43:51,379 --> 00:43:55,859
Are you not yet at an age when you
might just be a little bit gracious

759
00:43:55,899 --> 00:43:58,020
and think about how I am feeling

760
00:43:58,060 --> 00:44:01,219
and not how everything,
EVERYTHING is about you?

761
00:44:01,259 --> 00:44:04,100
<font color="cyan">Oh, Mum...</font>
<font color="#008000">Oh for God's sake!</font>

762
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:08,500
<font color="yellow">Vivien!</font>
<font color="yellow">Come quick! Your car! It's on fire!</font>

763
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:10,939
<font color="#008000">What?</font>
<font color="cyan">Oh, my God!</font>

764
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:13,700
FLAMES CRACKLE

765
00:44:13,739 --> 00:44:17,100
<font color="cyan">Jesus! What the - Mum!</font>

766
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:18,580
<font color="yellow">Stand back, get well away!</font>

767
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:21,460
Mark! Please leave it!
<font color="yellow">Get further back!</font>

768
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:24,580
And Mark Kinneally had only just
bought the car for your mother

769
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:26,460
when it was set on fire,
is that right?

770
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:28,259
<font color="cyan">Yeah, that's right.</font>

771
00:44:29,339 --> 00:44:31,299
<font color="cyan">Just kids, we think.</font>
Hm.

772
00:44:31,339 --> 00:44:33,339
<font color="yellow">Get back! Get back!</font>
<font color="yellow">It's going to blow!</font>

773
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:35,620
<font color="cyan">No, no! Dear God!</font>

774
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:40,980
But none of you actually saw any
kids on the beach that night?

775
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:43,299
<font color="cyan">No.</font>

776
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:46,939
<font color="#008000">Sorry to interrupt, sir.</font>
<font color="#008000">A message from the hospital.</font>
