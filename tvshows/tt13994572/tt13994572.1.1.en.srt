ARTHUR SCARGILL: And you've got
to make up your mind!

4
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,719
Are you going to accept it
down on your knees?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,199
Or are you going to stand and fight,

6
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,359
and oppose the closure and
the butchery of your industry?

7
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,039
CROWD CHANTING:
We'll never be defeated!

8
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:44,479
We're miners! United!
We'll never be defeated!

9
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:49,159
THATCHER: You saw the scenes which
went on in television last night.

10
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,919
I must tell you that what we've got

11
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,320
is an attempt to substitute the rule
of the mob for the rule of law.

12
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:02,719
MINER: A baton blow to the back of
the head, fracturing me skull,

13
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,159
and baton blows across me back,
me legs and me ankles.

14
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,919
REPORTER: Done by whom?
The police. By the police.

15
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,119
Get in here and see
what they're doing.

16
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:14,039
NEWSREADER: In spite of the
ongoing strike, 10 of the 12

17
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,879
collieries in Nottinghams hire
have defied the union

18
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,919
and are operating normally.

19
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,799
REPORTER: Why aren't you in favour
of the strike?

20
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,199
Cos I can't afford to strike.
I just can't afford to strike.

21
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,319
NEWSREADER: Those men in
Nottinghams hire who want

22
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,119
to go to work could be subjected
to daily insults and reproaches

23
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,159
by those men who are out on strike.

24
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,199
REPORTER: As some of the
local miners walked in,

25
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,999
they were followed by groups of
flying pickets who'd spent the night

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,039
hidden in Sherwood Forest.

27
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,359
MINER: A lot of pickets
are very aggressive,

28
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,159
calling us names and
throwing stones at us.

29
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,919
We won't be bullied by pickets
from Yorkshire.

30
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:48,759
ARTHUR SCARGILL: But I warn you that
if at the conclusion of this dispute

31
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:52,159
you are still crossing
our picket lines,

32
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:55,839
you will be stained till
the end of time as a scab!

33
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,119
CROWD CHANTING:
Scab! Scab! Scab!

34
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,920
CHANTING FADES

35
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,519
When you live in a village
and come from a village

36
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,719
what's connected to a mine,

37
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,840
what happens in t'community
happens to everybody.

KNOCK AT DOOR

42
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,119
Ooh...! Oh, hello.

43
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,919
Hiya. Sorry.

44
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,319
I didn't know if you were in or not,
so I was just going to post it,

45
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,919
but... here.

46
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,679
Are you registered to vote?

47
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,159
Are you registered insane?

48
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,999
A Tory councillor?
Yeah, why not?

49
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,199
We have a Tory MP in Ash field now.

50
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,999
The red wall fell. Didn't you hear?

51
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,039
Labour can't take working class
votes for granted any more.

52
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,759
Those days are long dead.

53
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,519
You're all right, me duck.

54
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,840
HE LAUGHS DERISIVELY

55
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,319
I'll post this anyway.

56
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,240
You can follow me on social media,
as and when.

PHONE RINGS

58
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,599
Neel? What is it?

59
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,639
You're out bloody flyering, Sarah.

60
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,279
I'm not! I'm on my way
to the hairdresser's.

61
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,959
Stop having a go.

62
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,719
Yeah, well, our Danny's Gemma's
stepsister, Katrina, said

63
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,559
you knocked on her door, so...

64
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,639
All right, I'm doing
a couple of roads

65
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,439
on the way to the hairdresser's.

66
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,519
Do you really think
this is the day for it?

67
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,999
How's it looking? OK?

68
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,359
Look, stop flyering, will you?
Not today.

69
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,120
OK. OK. I'll see you in a bit.

70
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,799
Noah!

71
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,560
CHILDREN SHOUT

72
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,399
Hey, look! It's Trevor Francis.

73
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,799
Who? Who?!

74
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,919
First million-pound player.

75
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,199
Notts Forest centre forward.

76
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,679
52-caps-for-England who!

77
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,399
Now, then.

78
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,479
See, you've got to be light
on your feet, lads, right?

79
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,239
But wi' power behind you! Wahey!

80
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,559
Like Muhammad Ali.

81
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,119
Float like a butterfly...

82
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,520
...sting like a bee!

83
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,559
Who's that?

84
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,199
Go on inside for your mamma.

85
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,839
Why? Go on. Just do it.

86
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,919
Right, that's it, lads.
See you in a bit.

87
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,440
See you.

88
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,479
BALL THUDS

89
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,600
TYRES SCREECH

90
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,079
Right, I've got to dash.

91
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,719
Hold on. Ian, you're wearing your
uniform. What about the wedding?

92
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,079
Yeah, I did ask, but they said
I had to wear it for the photos,

93
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,039
you know... And I've got
to salute the Sheriff.

94
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,599
OK, well, I'll take your suit
with me, then,

95
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,359
and you get changed there
before it starts.

96
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,239
But you cannot be late.

97
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,799
No. I've got to go. Go on, then.

98
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,920
Show me your salute for the Sheriff.

99
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,519
I thought that was a salute.

100
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,079
No. That's American.

101
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,519
British, American,
British, American.

102
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,320
See you later.

103
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,999
Ian. Uh-huh?

104
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,799
Don't be late.

105
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,560
AMERICAN ACCENT: Yes, ma'am.

106
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,079
Oh!

107
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,599
Would it kill any one on you to
clear away your plate just once?

108
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,199
Cindy, turn the telly off!

109
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,399
I always have it on when
I'm revising. Mum lets me.

110
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,919
Fine. I'll WhatsApp her, shall I?

111
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,400
Oh, God. Does this make me
look like a twat?

112
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,159
Is that better?

113
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,319
Can I have a friend round while
you're out, help me revise?

114
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,239
A friend? What friend?
And what name?

115
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,239
So I can do background checks,
character references.

116
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,559
And, anyway, no - you're looking
after your little brother.

117
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,439
What time's his new bedtime? 11:00.

118
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,039
Is it bollocks! 9:00.

119
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,119
Noah Jackson, look at...
Look at me.

120
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,879
What time do you go to bed at home?

121
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,439
9:00. Good boy.

122
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,399
No. Anyway, we'll be back by then.
He won't want to stay late.

123
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,799
Where have Mum and Dad even gone?

124
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,399
I told you, it's their wedding
anniversary. Cindy, off!

125
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,199
Don't call me Cindy! I hate it.

126
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:05,439
Oh, why did my daughter have to give
her kids such bloody hippy names?

127
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,760
What? Nothing!

128
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,239
What do you do on an anniversary?

129
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,399
You go to a nasty hotel in the middle
of nowhere and you have sad sex.

130
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,399
Ah! Cinderella Jackson!

131
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,919
What? It's true.

132
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:13,279
They go and have nice meals,
and talk about all the nice memories

133
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,839
they have of being married to one
another, including giving birth

134
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,879
to two wonderful children, who are
always good at clearing away

135
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,479
their plates and
washing up the pots.

136
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,919
Don't you have a dishwasher?

137
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,279
Yes, I do. Here it is.

138
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,999
Here's me dishwasher. In't it fancy?

139
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,359
It can do everything -
backchat, snarl, moan...

140
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,959
DOORBELL RINGS
...grumble.

141
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,239
Somebody's at the door.

142
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,279
SINGSONG: There's somebody
at the door!

143
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,039
There's somebody at the...!

144
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,799
You don't know what
I'm talking about, do you?

145
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,639
It's Rod and Emu. Gordon Bennett.

146
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,600
There's somebody at the door!

147
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,080
There's somebody at the...

148
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,799
All right?
Sorry, but he's doing it again.

149
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,319
Who's doing what again?
You know what.

150
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,359
He's burning rubbish here, when
he's got a perfectly good allotment.

151
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,079
The wind's blowing it right into our
house. It makes Fred struggle.

152
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,159
He can't control the direction of
the wind, can he? He's not God.

153
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,199
If it bothers Fred so much,
why doesn't he come and have

154
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,439
a quiet word? You know he's not
going to do that. I'm sure Gary

155
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,759
would stop if he asked him.
Why should he? Not send his little

156
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,599
helper to do his dirty work for him.
OK. Ta anyway.

157
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,040
Yeah, OK. Bye.

158
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,359
There is quite a lot of smoke, Gary.

159
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,199
It's a fire.

160
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,039
Where there's smoke, and all that.

161
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,799
Neighbours have complained.

162
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,239
HE GROANS

163
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,720
Let me guess.

164
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,439
Wow. Oh, don't.

165
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,319
Don't. I never wear hats.

166
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,439
I feel dead self-conscious.
I might just take it off.

167
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,399
Oh, you look...

168
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,000
You look fantastic.

169
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,599
SHE CHUCKLES

170
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,560
Come on. It's time.

171
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,920
DOOR OPENS

172
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,840
DOOR SHUTS

173
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,079
What'd she say?

174
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,640
She said, if you've got a problem,
you need to go round there yourself.

175
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,279
Arsehole.

176
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,399
Fred, that's my sister.

177
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,119
I'm talking about him.

178
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,599
Although she's an arsehole an' all.

179
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,119
Scott!

180
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,239
He's just gone out.

181
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,239
Hunting again.

182
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,119
Though, what he hunts
I haven't a clue.

183
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,519
Never seems to come back wi' owt.

184
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,759
We need to talk about next week.
He's not ready.

185
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,319
What's to get ready?

186
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,799
Daft ha'p'orth's getting sent down.

187
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,719
That's all there is to it.

Oh, aye, that's dead subtle,

Kitchen table?
FRIDGE DOOR OPENS

00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,639
Where's our Ronan? Out.

194
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,519
Who else is going to do it?
Are you doing it?

195
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,480
Don't appear so.

196
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,959
Don't get tanked up.

197
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,719
I've got about five bookings
for this reception tonight.

198
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,639
I'm only having one.

199
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,639
Well? Well, what?

200
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,359
Don't "well, what?" me.

201
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,120
You had words? Is it him?

202
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,679
HE SIGHS

203
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,999
Right, fuck this. Game of soldiers.

204
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,319
You want something doing...
Oh, give over, Dad.

205
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,120
I got it, all right?

00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,879
Sparrow Cabs.

208
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,200
Er, yeah, is that for
the Fisher wedding?

209
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:31,279
Supporting law enforcement in
this city is a passion of mine.

210
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,959
Not just because I'm relieved
it no longer falls to

211
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:37,959
the Sheriff of Nottingham to uphold
the law, but because keeping peace

212
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:43,199
for our community requires the
success of operations like Reacher.

213
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,519
And with that, we have a special
commendation for Detective Chief

214
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:51,559
Superintendent of the East Midlands
Special Operations Unit,

215
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,759
Ian SAINT Clair!

216
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,240
SAINT Clair! That's you, mate.

217
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,999
Er, thank you. Thank you.

218
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,039
I don't mean to contradict you,
Madam Sheriff,

219
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,279
but it's pronounced the more
humble Sinclair, you know.

220
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,639
Oh...

221
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:17,439
As my mother used to say, it's
a mutton name in lamb dressing.

222
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,919
Which didn't stop me having ten
bells o' shite knocked out of me

223
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,000
at school, by the way, but...

224
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:26,399
Anyway. Yes, I was head
of this operation,

225
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,719
but the success was down to my team.

226
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,079
They worked tirelessly to get these
criminals off our streets.

227
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:36,639
Now, we all know that policing...

228
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:40,639
...requires the cooperation
of the public.

229
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:45,359
We need their...
their faith, support.

230
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,559
And we find ourselves not in
a particularly good place

231
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,239
in that regard at the moment.

232
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,999
And some might say with good reason.

233
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,759
The tradition is that we police
by consent,

234
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,439
and if we lose the consent
of the people, well...

235
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,439
Now, we have a long way to go
to earn back...

236
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,960
...some of that trust.

237
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,280
Thank you very much.

246
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:10,159
Sorry. I tapped on... If you'd
come round the front, Andy...

247
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,679
If you'd just come round the front
and ring the bell. Sorry.

248
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,880
This...

249
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,359
This isn't the suit we ordered.

250
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,399
Yeah... We sent off
your measurements.

251
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,359
Yeah, that didn't really fit.

252
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,919
Sorry. Felt a bit tight
around the, erm...

253
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,399
It's a fitted suit.

254
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,439
That's how it's meant to feel.
It feels fitted.

255
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,999
Yeah, well, I just...
I just feel better in this.

256
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,799
And a suit's a suit, right?

257
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,839
And nobody will be looking at me.

258
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,239
And if they are,
that's a problem, eh?

259
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,280
Hello.

260
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,919
You remember Neel's dad, Andy?
Lives next door.

261
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,439
Yeah. Hi.

262
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,920
All right.

You look, uh...

265
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,119
You do, Sarah.

266
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,519
You look...

267
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,879
Are you ready?

268
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,319
Yeah. Yeah. Shall we? Yeah.

269
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:04,160
Just lock the door for us, Andy,
will you? Right, yeah.

270
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,800
Oh, watch your step.

271
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,400
LIVELY CHATTER

272
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,359
Yes, I know... I told you.
I literally said get here early...

273
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,599
I know. Don't worry, don't worry.
It's all right.

274
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,919
Look, I'll change at the reception.
It'll be fine.

275
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,319
That was a lovely service.
Oh, thank you.

276
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,159
Cheers.

277
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,560
SARAH: We'll see you there.

278
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,039
Shameless...!

279
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,080
Absolutely shameless.

00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,559
All right? I'm Andy Fisher.

283
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,079
I know a lot of you know me, and a
lot of you don't from Sarah's side,

284
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,079
but I look greatly forward
to getting to

285
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:19,199
know you all at some point.

286
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,879
I know it's ever so sad, of
course, that I happen to be

287
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,839
standing here today, of course.

288
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:27,639
But I'm also very touched that
Neel and Sarah have asked me,

289
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:30,319
in the absence of Sarah's father,
who, as you know...

290
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,719
Was a scab... can't be
with us no more, so...

291
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,079
Thank you, Sarah, for asking me
to give you away today.

292
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,119
I'm very honoured.

293
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,599
You're off to the Yorkshire Dales
in a couple of weeks

294
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,079
after your, er, like...

295
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,319
...these elections.
It's a good choice.

296
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:48,719
Cos the Settle and Carlisle railway
line, which I got you tickets on,

297
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,639
is one of the oldest and most
beautiful in all the world.

298
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,199
It is, honestly.

299
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,319
Built in the 1840s by over
6,000 navvies,

300
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,079
many of whom lost their lives.

301
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,239
Some of the most harshest conditions
imaginable, cos you had your...

302
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,839
...the wind and your rain
and your snow.

303
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,160
And, erm...

304
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,719
Well, smallpox was the
biggest killer.

305
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,439
But it stands, I think,
as a good metaphor for what

306
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,039
a good marriage is, based on
my own very happy life

307
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,960
with my late wife
and Neel's mum, Trudy.

308
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:23,439
The terrain required tunnels to be
blasted into the mountainsides,

309
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,839
and viaducts to cross gaping
valleys, like beautiful

310
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,559
Ribblehead Viaduct - which I'm
sure you've all seen pictures of,

311
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,079
even if you haven't been.

312
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,839
And then there's the incline
at Blea Moor.

313
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,919
It's a 1:100 gradient,

314
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:38,919
which the locals refer to
as "the long drag."

315
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:42,279
Which certain parts in the journey
of a marriage can feel like, eh?

00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,400
But we... we keep going.

318
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,759
Bridging the gaps.

319
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,519
Pushing through the obstacles,
and...

320
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,400
...get out the other side.

321

00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,440
Nice to see you, an' all.

334
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,279
Ey up, Noah. All right?

335
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,159
Mamma said...
Mamma doesn't understand.

336
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,639
We have to be together to revise.

337
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,839
Yeah. Biology.
Have to do it in pairs.

00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,519
Look, she didn't want you playing
that either, did she?

340
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,039
But I won't tell her
if you don't tell her.

Come on.

343
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,039
Nice... to have the house
all to yersen.

344
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,039
Shall we, uh, go upstairs?

345
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,199
It's my nan and grandad's,
so we can't be long.

I had what you might call
a difficult encounter

362
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,639
with public speaking today.

372
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,440
Fine and dandy.

373
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,239
Hey, you should call your

Oh, right, I get it, yeah.
Cos she's...

00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,279
but you don't want to be wearing
that for the first week in prison,

450
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:16,079
so you are allowed a small bag

479
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,039
Think I'm going to have to
get an early night.

480
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,479
Sorry.

481
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:36,039
Can we change the channel? No!

482
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:39,119
Sundays is Antiques Roadshow,
whether I'm down here or not.

483
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,600
It's tradition.

484
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,959
Do you want us to wake you? No.

485
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:49,320
Your grandad will crash in
drunk later. That'll do it.

486
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,920
Night! Night. Night.

487
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,359
Boo!

488
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,040
You twat! I shit myself.

489
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,120
Hello.

490
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,239
Thanks, Maddie.

491
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,520
Scab.

492
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,319

Er, no.

502
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,319
No, he's definitely not alive.

503
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,999
He... Oh, Christ.

504
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,720
I've been here for ten minutes...

505
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,920
SIREN BLARES

00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,320

509
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,479
I'm on the phone to one of
your lads... No worries.

510
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,399
Guys, if you wouldn't mind
staying in your houses

511
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,999
just for a minute, please, yeah?
Just for a second.

512
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,599
I didn't hear him come in,
didn't hear him go out.

513
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,200
He's like a bloody ninja.

There's somebody at the door!

There's somebody at the door!

00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,400
There's somebody at the door.

523
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,879
Is your husband Gary Jackson?
Yes!

00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,919
Mrs Jackson...

Oh, God... Mrs Jackson!

527
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,800

00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,159
No!

00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,200

00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:16,199
Gary!

531
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:19,479
Get away! Get away! It's my husband!

532
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,559
Get the fuck off me!

533
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,680
Get off me! It's my husband!

534
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,239

No. It's your day off, in lieu.

538
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,799
You know what "in lieu" means?

539
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,239
No, actually.

540
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,479
Sir?

541
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,159
Ian. Yeah, something's come up.

542
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:01,479
Serious incident in Ash field
this morning.

543
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,160
Whereabouts?

544
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,280
I'm so sorry, Julie.

545
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:48,319
MUFFLED: I know you're going to want
to be out there with him.

546
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:52,719
But it is honestly better if you
just stay in here.

547
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:55,640
It's a big shock, I know.

548
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:00,199
We have got a family liaison
officer and...

549
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,999
No, I don't want lots of people
in here.

550
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,200
No.

JULIE HESITATES

556
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,280
How long has he been out there?

557
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,400
Has he been there all night?

558
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,719
Has he been there all night
all alone,

559
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,879
while I was here just
fucking sleeping?

Oh, God!

562
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:58,159
Where were he coming back from?

563
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,560
Er...

564
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,799
Just the clubbie.

565
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,079
Just the clubbie, the usual.

566
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,800
Look, I'm, um...

567
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:13,079
I'm sorry to ask, but can you
think of anyone? I mean...

568
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:17,319
...were there any ongoing disputes
with anyone at all?

569
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,680
Disputes?

570
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,680
Well...

571
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:28,199
Nothing specific, no.
I mean, not... not really.

572
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,840
Well, not anyone that would do that.

573
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,799
Do you want me to call
anyone for you?

574
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,919
You know, a friend just to
come and sit with you? No.

575
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:43,280
How about their mum, eh?
Shall I give your Rosie a call?

576
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,999
She's on a cruise. She's...

577
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,119
She's... she's abroad.

578
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:58,879
She won't be back for another week.

579
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,839
Oh, Christ. Don't make me
tell her on the phone, please.

580
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:04,199
It's her dad.
I can't tell her on the phone.

581
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,759
Right. Well, we'll call her.

582
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:11,279
Oh, and Gary's phone - do you know,
did he have a pass code at all?

583
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,480
Yeah, yeah, it's, erm...

584
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:18,240
It's the dog's birthday - 0708.

585
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,440
Oh, bloody hell. The dog!

586
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,839
Was it all right? Yeah.

587
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:31,239
PIN for his phone.
Check his last calls, messages.

588
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,319
You can trace his last route
if you like, but she says

589
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,239
he was just to and from the club.

590
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:37,199
There's a nightclub round here?

591
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,119
Miners' welfare.
They call it the clubbie.

592
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,319
Interview the staff there as
a matter of priority.

593
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,999
Oh, and there's a dog.

594
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,639
Black dachshund-Jack Russell cross.
See if you can find it.

595
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,079
To give a witness statement?

596
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,999
Prints.

597
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,119
On the collar. You never know.

598
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:57,119
Well, you always did promise to
invite me round your ends, boss.

599
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,000
Well, it WAS my end.

600
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,479
You all right? Yeah.

601
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,239
Go on.

602
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,560
Yep.

603
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,680
I won't speak ill of the...
you know, but...

604
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:42,399
Jacko weren't afraid to...

605
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,679
...you know, speak his mind, like.

606
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:47,319
He was proud, you know.

607
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:50,279
Sometimes that could get to people.

608
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:53,919
And because it's...
round here, a lot of folk...

609
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,960
Well, they just want to forget,
don't they? You know?

610
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,839
Is she all right, Julie?

611
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:03,800
There's a family liaison
officer with her now.

612
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,439
Right.

613
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:09,919
The landlady at the club said there
was some sort of altercation.

614
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,639
Did you witness that?

615
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,159
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

616
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:14,719
What was it about?

617
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,839
Er, well...

618
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,919
Just name-calling, really, uh...

619
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:21,959
Yeah, he's been doing it for years,
to a lot of folk.

620
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:25,399
I have... Well, we have, uh...

621
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,239
...nowt to do with him. He's...

622
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,799
FRED EXHALES

623
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,119
Our families, we don't...

624
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,919
No, there's nowt.

625
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:36,559
You said you came straight back
after your drink. What time?

626
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,799
Oh... what time? Er...

627
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,679
Oh, it was half ten, maybe.

628
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,239
But we were all home,
all three of us.

629
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,439
All three of you? My stepson.

630
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:50,039
His son, Scott. But he's out.

631
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:54,079
I'll need all three of you to
make full statements. Yeah.

632
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:57,840
No-one in the family is engaged in,
like, any sort of archery?

633
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,560
No.

634
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,440
MEN ARGUE NEARBY

635
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,159
Get a job, will you?

636
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:37,359
Walk away, son! Like the coward
you was back then!

637
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:40,199
Hey! It's your lot's done
this to Gary!

638
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,959
Yeah, you heard me.

639
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:44,239
You're fucking mental,
the fucking lot of you.

640
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,399
Oh, come on, then.
Say that again!

641
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,399
Say that to my fucking face!
Come on, then!

642
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,279
Say that again!
Come on. All right...

643
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,719
Oh, look. Here he fucking comes, eh?

644
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:54,239
Back up... Like you give
a flying fuck. Eh?

645
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,239
All your lot ever did was
make things worse!

646
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,279
Go on, piggy. Do your job.
Trotter off.

647
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:01,159
Come on... Get a life!
Once a scab, always a scab.

648
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,879
Come on, let's get in, eh?

649
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,879
Sorry.

650
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,999
Take no notice of that lot.

651
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,879
We never forget. We...

652
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,559
...never forget around here.

653
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:13,759
All right. Well, let us
just do our job, eh?

654
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,560
Aye. Sorry, Ian.

655
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,199
He's on the PNC, Gary Jackson.

656
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:38,639
Arrested in October...
October '84, yeah.

657
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:41,200
I remember.
I were a young PC at the time.

658
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,839
Suspected arson with intent. Wow.

659
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,999
Alongside four others.

660
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,759
Charges were dropped following the
intervention of another officer.

661
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,159
What?

662
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:52,919
I can pull the file,
if you want to read it.

663
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,839
Oh, you can if you want.

664
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:57,039
But I were there, so I remember
what happened.

665
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,760
PHONE VIBRATES

666
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,559
1984...

667
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,919
George Orwell.

668
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,479
That's not what I were thinking.

669
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,959
Lab has just sent the results
from his phone.

670
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:13,759
Last text was Friday -
to a solicitor in Kirkby.

671
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:17,399
Chakrabarti. He had an
appointment with him...

672
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:20,919
...today. Well, let's get
someone up there ASAP, eh?

673
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:24,799
Oh, and the man who had
a row with Gary last night

674
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,399
is Dean... Dean summat.

675
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,319
Dean...

676
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,759
Dean Simmons. Lives at number 13.

677
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:32,959
Yeah, I've just been dealing
with him out there.

678
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:36,359
And him and Gary had words
at the reception on Saturday,

679
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:39,079
so I don't care what his alibi is,
you make sure you get

680
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:40,479
his clothes from last night.

681
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,960
Yep, no problem.

682
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:47,879
In the victim profile, you should
mention that Gary were NUM.

683
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:50,439
National Union of Mineworkers.

684
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:53,319
He were one of the few round here
who kept solidarity with them

685
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:57,039
during the strike. This was
predominantly a UDM village.

686
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:00,720
Breakaway union. They didn't support
the strike, went back to work.

687
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,959
All that was a while ago, ain't it?

688
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,400
I know.

689
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:11,159
James, let us know when that
printer's set up, would you?

690
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:12,680
Will do, sir.

691
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:22,879
CROWD CHANTING: We're miners!
United! We'll never be defeated!

692
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:25,680
We're miners! United!
We'll never be defeated!

693
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:32,360
We're miners! United!
We'll never be defeated!

694
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:39,399
A couple of private security
cameras confirm

695
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,639
Gary returned home at 10:18pm.

696
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:43,719
None of them caught what happened.

697
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:46,199
But he walks past this one
at number 23,

698
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,599
turns, coming back up the street,
passing it again,

699
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:51,119
possibly because his murderer
called out to him.

700
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:52,719
Anything else?

701
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,959
Well, what's sort of amazing is that
none of the neighbours, bar one,

702
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:59,319
mentioned the fact that there's
an archery range up on a farm,

703
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:03,439
off the Elmbank Road, run by
a family called the Sparrows.

704
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,000
Oh, the Sparrows. Jeez...

705
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:10,119
They're sort of "that family"
round here.

706
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:12,639
Only been charged with minor
drug of fences, so far,

707
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:14,239
but we suspect them of more.

708
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:17,439
So, I think people are wary
of naming them.

709
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:20,599
Truth be told, some folk round
here don't seem massively happy

710
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:23,159
to be speaking to us, full stop.

711
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,719
Well, don't take it personally.

712
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:27,799
There's a lot of history
round here with the police.

713
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:29,479
You're doing a good job.
You stick to it.

714
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:30,999
All right, you two.

715
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,199
After this, you go to the
Sparrows'. Ta. Mm-hm.

716
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:36,519
Is anyone, at some point,
going to mention the obvious

717
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:38,359
cultural reference point here?

718
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:40,959
Bow and arrow,
heart of Nottinghams hire -

719
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:43,600
a modern-day Robin Hood...
Can we not do that?

720
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:46,799
Start giving nicknames
to wanted murderers

721
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,239
and the press gets excited.

722
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:49,959
And these are good people.

723
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:53,999
I don't want their tragedy turned
into some tacky headline, all right?

724
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,120
Let's meet again at 6:00.

725
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:59,640
Just give us a sec.

726
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:04,760
Boss.

727
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,639
You might want to look at this.

728
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,959
Gary Jackson's arrest file.

729
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,839
Some of it's redacted.

730
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:14,719
Restricted access.

731
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,279
Restricted? Mm.

732
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:19,239
I assume it's with regards to the
information that led to his arrest.

733
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:21,919
Yeah, but his charges were dropped.
Makes no sense.

734
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:24,159
Well, the officer that intervened
to get it dropped was from

735
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:27,039
the London Met. That might be
part of it, different force.

736
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,439
Yeah, I remember him.

737
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,799
Thanks. Yep, no problem.

738
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:33,280
See you in a bit.

739
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:47,640

Yeah.

743
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:58,119
Dad, look, I'm sorry. But I did say
I had people coming round tonight.

744
00:45:58,120 --> 00:45:59,999
I know, I know, I know.
Look, I'll get out your hair.

745
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,119
I just came back... You left
the airbed and your clothes

746
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:04,479
all over the floor. Well, that's
why I came back, cos I forgot...

747
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,959
I don't mind you staying here.
I like you staying here. Just...

748
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:08,399
Come on.

749
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,639
Look, I am sorry, Adam, all right?

750
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:12,360
I know it's not ideal, but...

751
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:17,719
Yeah... Dad, listen. Mum's going
to swing by, too, briefly.

752
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:20,079
I just thought you should know,
in case you came back early.

753
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:22,399
You know what? I'll twist the
knife in even further, shall I?

754
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:24,119
Save you the trouble?
Oh, Dad, come on.

755
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:26,119
If the two of you worked harder
together, maybe...

756
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:28,519
It's not about trying harder, Adam.

757
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:30,479
You know, when two people are
wrong for each other...

758
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:32,799
How can you say our family was
wrong? All right, all right.

759
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:35,239
Not wrong. Just eventually...

760
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:37,680
Just not right enough, you know?

761
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:41,600
Look, I'll be all right.
Don't worry about me.

DI Salisbury? Yeah.

767
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:23,039
We have a call coming in from
Nottinghams hire Police for you.

768
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:24,519
Nottingham?

769
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:26,680
Yeah. DCS Ian St Clair.

770
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:32,240
Can we transfer that through?

771
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,399
Yeah, Yeah.

772
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,000
Just bear with me.

00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,320
Just transferring you now.

774
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,199
DI Salisbury.

775
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:51,280
DI Salisbury, this is Detective
Chief Superintendent Ian St Clair.

776
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,239
How can I help?

777
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:59,919
We're investigating the murder of
a local resident here, Gary Jackson.

778
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:03,119
His record shows that he was
arrested in October '84,

779
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:05,799
but the charges were dropped
following an intervention

780
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:08,679
by yourself, if I recall.

781
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:11,319
Well, as I'm sure
you can appreciate,

782
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:13,400
that was all quite a long time ago.

783
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:18,799
We're having trouble accessing some
of the relevant details, strangely.

784
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:21,239
Particularly who provided the
information leading up to

785
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:23,799
his arrest, and whether they
have anything to do

786
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,519
with his subsequent murder.

787
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:28,719
Yeah, well, if it's all right with
you, given how long ago it was

788
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:31,719
and how complicated this
particular matter was,

789
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:35,279
I'd prefer to submit anything
in writing, so it's less...

790
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:37,279
Less clumsy.

791
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:39,119
Well, maybe I could send you
some questions,

792
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:40,359
and you can get back to me.

793
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:42,199
Yeah, that'd be fine.

00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:57,439
We won't take more than a minute.

799
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:59,679
You can have it stood here,
then, can't you?

800
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:01,439
Don't need to come in.

801
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:04,079
Actually, we're investigating
a murder.

802
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:06,519
We wondered if you have any
records of regular visitors

803
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:08,319
to your range thing over there.

804
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:10,119
Why? Who got killed?

805
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:11,439
Your records.

806
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:13,959
This ain't Butlin's.
We don't keep records.

807
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:15,479
People come up, pay cash.

808
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:16,520
Here.

809
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:21,159
Ones who book by phone and leave
their name, at any rate.

810
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:22,519
Thanks.

811
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:24,999
We'll be in touch if we need
anything else.

812
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,919
Cheers.

813
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:28,240
Thank you.

814
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:35,919
We've looked into this, and,
regrettably, it appears

815
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:39,119
the information Notts Constabulary
require relates to

816
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:43,639
a confidential matter elsewhere,
unrelated to the poor victim.

817
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:45,159
A confidential matter...

818
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:49,239
Nevertheless, we feel it might be
good if you actually went there.

819
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:52,519
Show willing, offer support,
an exchange between forces.

820
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:54,399
Yeah, and a way to get me
to clear off for a bit

821
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,279
while the IOPC deliver
their verdict on me.

822
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:59,639
It'd just be for a couple
of days, DI Salisbury.

823
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:03,079
But since you bring it up, it would
be good to discuss what options

824
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:05,879
are available to you in
advance of their decision.

825
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:09,519
What, firing squad, noose,
lethal injection?

826
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,519
You lost your head, Kevin.

827
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:14,359
A fellow officer is charging you
with physical assault.

828
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:17,799
Yeah, well, this anonymous officer
has a history of treating suspects

829
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:20,799
from certain ethnic backgrounds,
shall we say... quite aggressively?

830
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,399
And when I witnessed
such behaviour...

831
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,519
Yes, I've seen the X-ray of his arm.

832
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:27,560
Yeah, and I've seen the posts
he likes on social media, so...

833
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:31,959
HE EXHALES

834
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:35,159
You've a decent record.
Twice interviewed to make DCI.

835
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:39,280
And yet, for various reasons,
it didn't quite pan out that way.

836
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:44,239
You've gone as far as you can, Kev.
Done your 30 years.

837
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:46,399
Pension in the bag, retirement's
there for the taking.

838
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,920
And then all this can go away.

839
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:53,839
KEVIN SIGHS Look, erm...

840
00:50:53,840 --> 00:51:00,359
My personal and financial
circumstances aren't in a...

841
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:03,919
Yeah, I'm going through
a messy divorce.

842
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:08,559
And I do feel, what with
everything else, that...

843
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:11,560
...I would like to keep working
for a while longer.

844
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:14,760
Please.

845
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:21,040
Then it looks like you're going
to Nottinghams hire, doesn't it?

846
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:32,400
PHONE RINGS

847
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:40,399
Hello?

848
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:41,679
Uh, Julie?

849
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:43,719
Hi. Sorry for calling you late.

850
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:45,839
It's Ian St Clair.

851
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:47,879
Oh, yeah.

852
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:49,919
Yeah, go on.

853
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:52,839
Well, I were just wondering
if Gary, erm...

854
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:56,479
...you know, anything had come up
recently about his arrest

855
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:59,959
during the strike. It's just,
we're having a bit of trouble

856
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:01,880
getting information around that.

857
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:05,080
What, in '84?

858
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:08,519
What's that got to do wi' anything?

859
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:10,479
Well, probably nothing.

860
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:13,559
Just, you know, we're covering
all the bases, that's all.

861
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:15,679
I probably shouldn't have called.

862
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:17,720
No. Always call.

863
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:21,720
I want you to always call,
wi' anything.

864
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:26,880
Are you all right?

865
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:29,720
No.

866
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:34,120
But I've got my grandkids
here and...

867
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:37,280
...my daughter's on her way, so...

868
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:40,760
Are YOU all right?

869
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,279
Yeah. Erm...

870
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:47,519
Look, we'll be in touch.

871
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:49,999
All right? Goodbye.

872
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,280
Yeah. Bye.

873
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:32,879
...totally responsible for
that happening, all right?

874
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:34,280
So don't worry.

875
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:40,800
You all right, love?
Yeah, yeah, fine.

876
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:18,600
ARROW THUDS
