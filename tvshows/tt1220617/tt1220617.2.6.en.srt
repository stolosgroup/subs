The Inbetweeners 2x05
"Exam Times"

4
00:00:21,314 --> 00:00:23,816
<i>All in all, it had been a strange
few months for me and my friends.</i>

5
00:00:24,528 --> 00:00:27,416
<i>My plan to raise our social standing
had been a qualified success.</i>

6
00:00:27,768 --> 00:00:30,336
<i>To be honest, if anything,
we'd slipped down the social ladder.</i>

7
00:00:30,504 --> 00:00:32,376
<i>I learned the worst way
to impress a girl.</i>

8
00:00:32,544 --> 00:00:33,936
<i>Feisty one, you are!</i>

9
00:00:34,119 --> 00:00:36,496
<i>Or kill a fish.
But the end was in sight.</i>

10
00:00:36,679 --> 00:00:38,376
<i>The end of term, the end of year,</i>

11
00:00:38,544 --> 00:00:41,155
<i>and if I didn't pass my AS levels,
the end of my life.</i>

12
00:00:41,238 --> 00:00:42,955
<i>But at least Simon was relax.</i>

13
00:00:43,038 --> 00:00:43,936
Hi, Simon.

14
00:00:45,041 --> 00:00:46,938
- Shit!
- Revising hard?

15
00:00:48,576 --> 00:00:49,536
Yeah. Shit.

16
00:00:49,704 --> 00:00:51,056
- Are you OK?
- Sorry.

17
00:00:51,238 --> 00:00:53,675
Bit wet. Mum'll get it out,
though, not to worry.

18
00:00:53,758 --> 00:00:56,336
Sorry to disturb you.
I wanted to ask a favour.

19
00:00:57,104 --> 00:00:59,216
- You don't know what it is yet.
- Sorry. Go on.

20
00:00:59,384 --> 00:01:01,456
Can I come to yours
and revise sociology with you?

21
00:01:01,638 --> 00:01:04,689
Yes. God, yes.
Come over anytime. Come over now.

22
00:01:05,223 --> 00:01:06,416
I can't come over now.

23
00:01:06,819 --> 00:01:08,202
No, course not.

24
00:01:08,681 --> 00:01:10,016
But this is great of you.

25
00:01:10,184 --> 00:01:12,376
It's hard to revise at home
cos we've got the builders in.

26
00:01:13,832 --> 00:01:15,216
Is that a euphemism?

27
00:01:15,627 --> 00:01:16,336
Sorry?

28
00:01:16,708 --> 00:01:18,496
You know,
like having the painters in.

29
00:01:19,273 --> 00:01:20,976
Sorry, I don't really get it.

30
00:01:21,729 --> 00:01:23,496
No, don't worry,
it wasn't that funny.

31
00:01:23,821 --> 00:01:25,896
- What did you mean?
- Come on, what does it mean?

32
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,159
Just,

33
00:01:28,887 --> 00:01:32,016
"having the painters in" means
being on your period, right?

34
00:01:32,404 --> 00:01:34,256
So when you said
you couldn't concentrate

35
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:36,090
cos you had the builders in,

36
00:01:36,523 --> 00:01:40,496
I thought that might be a euphemism
for you being on your period.

37
00:01:41,692 --> 00:01:43,696
Right. OK, I see.

38
00:01:43,864 --> 00:01:47,205
- Wasn't that funny, really.
- No, it's fine. I get it.

39
00:01:47,638 --> 00:01:49,976
- See you tonight, then?
- Cool. See you tonight.

40
00:01:50,927 --> 00:01:52,431
You're going to that freak's house?

41
00:01:52,514 --> 00:01:54,197
<i>So despite him behaving like a tool,</i>

42
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,258
<i>Carli was actually
going round to Simon's</i>

43
00:01:56,341 --> 00:01:58,793
<i>and even stranger things
were happening at Jay's.</i>

44
00:02:05,372 --> 00:02:06,327
No, Jay.

45
00:02:06,981 --> 00:02:08,176
I'm not ready, sorry.

46
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:12,456
No, I'm sorry.
I don't want to rush things either.

47
00:02:13,065 --> 00:02:14,296
- Really?
- Yeah,

48
00:02:14,664 --> 00:02:16,656
I'd hate for you to think
I'm only here for sex.

49
00:02:18,078 --> 00:02:20,886
But just so you know,
if you do want to touch me downstairs,

50
00:02:21,155 --> 00:02:22,336
I'm fine with that.

51
00:02:23,127 --> 00:02:24,096
I'm OK for now.

52
00:02:25,938 --> 00:02:27,696
I'd better go,
my mum's expecting me,

53
00:02:28,027 --> 00:02:29,496
and shouldn't you be revising?

54
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:31,433
Maybe I should,

55
00:02:32,696 --> 00:02:35,176
but when you're near me, Chloe,
I can't think about anything else.

56
00:02:35,571 --> 00:02:36,808
You're so sweet.

57
00:02:37,312 --> 00:02:38,732
Come on, I'll walk you home.

58
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:40,330
Unless you want to...

59
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:44,590
- No, thanks.
- Yeah. No. Come on.

60
00:02:44,673 --> 00:02:46,736
<i>Unlike the others, my revision
strategy </i>

61
00:02:46,904 --> 00:02:49,896
<i>went beyond trying to get into
girls knickers. I was studying hard,</i>

62
00:02:50,064 --> 00:02:52,456
<i>and by hard, I mean doing
anything to avoid revising.</i>

63
00:02:52,636 --> 00:02:54,296
I said no, Mum,
I had a bath yesterday!

64
00:02:54,464 --> 00:02:55,327
All right?

65
00:02:55,824 --> 00:02:58,096
- It's you.
- Yeah. What is all this shit?

66
00:02:58,405 --> 00:03:00,976
It's not shit. The schedule
alone took me two days to make.

67
00:03:01,144 --> 00:03:03,025
- Look, you'll never guess...
- Don't sit down.

68
00:03:03,108 --> 00:03:05,296
- What?
- Don't... sit... down.

69
00:03:05,464 --> 00:03:08,047
Look, I came round cos
I've got the most amazing news.

70
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:11,216
Carli asked me, she asked me
if she can come round

71
00:03:11,384 --> 00:03:12,816
to my house to revise.

72
00:03:13,563 --> 00:03:14,604
Amazing, yeah?

73
00:03:14,803 --> 00:03:16,616
Just have a look at
this for me, will you?

74
00:03:16,784 --> 00:03:18,936
- Sure, what is it?
- It's my revision schedule.

75
00:03:19,104 --> 00:03:20,296
- So?
- Does it say,

76
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:24,441
"Listen to Simon witter on about
his futile crush on Carli D'Amato"?

77
00:03:24,524 --> 00:03:27,446
- Don't be a dick. We're mates and...
- Goodbye, Simon!

78
00:03:27,529 --> 00:03:29,376
- I just wanted...
- Goodbye!

79
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:31,256
Twat.

80
00:03:34,104 --> 00:03:35,460
Look, Simon, I told...

81
00:03:36,543 --> 00:03:38,656
- All right?
- Did you just see Simon?

82
00:03:38,824 --> 00:03:41,576
Nah, your mum let me in.
She is looking hot, if I may say.

83
00:03:41,744 --> 00:03:42,661
You may not.

84
00:03:43,864 --> 00:03:46,296
- Anyway, I need help revising.
- What subjects do you do?

85
00:03:46,464 --> 00:03:48,536
- What, now?
- Yes, now.

86
00:03:48,704 --> 00:03:50,776
- Tech and design and PE.
- PE?

87
00:03:51,595 --> 00:03:54,536
And that's an actual AS level
at the school I now attend, is it?

88
00:03:55,101 --> 00:03:57,576
Oh God! I don't know,
go for a run or something.

89
00:03:57,944 --> 00:03:59,623
Yes, I hadn't thought of that!
Nice one.

90
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:01,744
<i>Neil jogged home.
And later that evening,</i>

91
00:04:01,827 --> 00:04:04,556
<i>Simon had Carli where he'd always
wanted her, in his bedroom.</i>

92
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:07,256
<i>Unfortunately, she was fully
clothed and discussing sociology.</i>

93
00:04:07,434 --> 00:04:09,997
I suppose the big thing
is that Parsons' description

94
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,896
is one of the traditional
nuclear families,

95
00:04:12,074 --> 00:04:14,296
so it means what he says might
not be relevant for people.

96
00:04:15,024 --> 00:04:17,275
You could be stronger on that
like it doesn't mean

97
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:20,473
his work on the family is invalid,
but it's a important qualification.

98
00:04:20,556 --> 00:04:23,456
Right, course.
Do you want to watch a DVD?

99
00:04:23,624 --> 00:04:26,216
Overall, was his theory
evolutionary or revolutionary?

100
00:04:27,575 --> 00:04:29,951
- Revolutionary.
- Evolutionary.

101
00:04:30,449 --> 00:04:31,568
Shit, I knew that.

102
00:04:32,594 --> 00:04:34,616
Simon, I've just brought you
some biscuits.

103
00:04:34,794 --> 00:04:36,940
What are you doing?
You know you're not allowed in here!

104
00:04:37,023 --> 00:04:40,216
All right, I'm going.
Say hello to your mum for me, Carli.

105
00:04:40,384 --> 00:04:41,216
Go away!

106
00:04:43,454 --> 00:04:45,976
- God, she's a nightmare.
- My mum's the same.

107
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:49,012
When I split up with Tom,
she was always hanging around

108
00:04:49,095 --> 00:04:51,016
when I was on the phone,
trying to listen in.

109
00:04:51,184 --> 00:04:52,236
Right, yeah.

110
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,136
Sorry, did you say
you'd split up with Tom?

111
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:02,985
- I thought everyone knew.
- Yeah, course, they do.

112
00:05:05,156 --> 00:05:07,136
He's a stupid lanky twat, isn't he?

113
00:05:07,914 --> 00:05:11,277
- I don't really want to talk about it.
- No, course.

114
00:05:12,978 --> 00:05:14,529
I might put some music on.

115
00:05:17,834 --> 00:05:19,033
Jay got me into this.

116
00:05:26,195 --> 00:05:28,136
Simon, do you mind if
we do something different?

117
00:05:28,313 --> 00:05:30,496
Not at all.
Maybe we could watch that DVD.

118
00:05:30,673 --> 00:05:33,030
I'm really shitting myself
about my last exam.

119
00:05:33,113 --> 00:05:36,376
I know you don't do geography, but
would you mind helping me out with it?

120
00:05:36,838 --> 00:05:37,936
I'm finding it hard.

121
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:39,936
Now?

122
00:05:42,115 --> 00:05:44,096
No problem at all. My pleasure.

123
00:05:44,272 --> 00:05:46,778
Thanks. So I thought
we'd do longshore drift first.

124
00:05:47,132 --> 00:05:48,531
Just turn that off.

125
00:05:50,322 --> 00:05:53,007
<i>So while Simon was cramming
for an exam he wasn't sitting,</i>

126
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:54,666
<i>Neil got learning difficulties.</i>

127
00:05:54,749 --> 00:05:57,696
- How's your revision going?
- Bad. I think I pulled a hamstring.

128
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,774
All right, benders? You missed me?

129
00:05:59,857 --> 00:06:01,276
Jay! All right, mate?

130
00:06:01,577 --> 00:06:03,138
- Where were you?
- I've been busy.

131
00:06:03,221 --> 00:06:05,270
- Doing what?
- I've met a girl.

132
00:06:05,672 --> 00:06:07,906
Yeah! What's this one,
a Russian lap dancer?

133
00:06:07,989 --> 00:06:10,804
No. Her name's Chloe
and she goes to St Claire's.

134
00:06:10,887 --> 00:06:13,256
We were at the bus stop,
and just got chatting.

135
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:15,496
Did you fuck her
behind the bus shelter?

136
00:06:16,025 --> 00:06:17,296
- No, Neil.
- Fingers?

137
00:06:17,464 --> 00:06:18,950
- No.
- Let's see a picture.

138
00:06:19,298 --> 00:06:20,776
Yeah, of her strumming herself.

139
00:06:21,056 --> 00:06:22,799
Neil, can you stop
talking like that?

140
00:06:23,401 --> 00:06:24,989
- Why?
- Because I've never felt this

141
00:06:25,072 --> 00:06:26,361
about a bird before.

142
00:06:27,238 --> 00:06:28,216
Chloe's special.

143
00:06:28,392 --> 00:06:30,456
More special than them twins
that only wanted anal?

144
00:06:31,053 --> 00:06:35,010
What, them? No, yeah, no. This is
different. That was purely sexual.

145
00:06:35,744 --> 00:06:36,896
Chloe's a real lady.

146
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:38,898
If she's real,
you should have a photo.

147
00:06:39,344 --> 00:06:40,476
There you go.

148
00:06:41,011 --> 00:06:42,013
Hot stuff!

149
00:06:43,228 --> 00:06:45,896
- She seems nice, mate.
- Yeah, she's good.

150
00:06:46,064 --> 00:06:47,856
You've nicked that off
girl's Facebook site.

151
00:06:48,024 --> 00:06:49,989
- I thought you were revising.
- I'm trying to but

152
00:06:50,072 --> 00:06:52,496
it's impossible with the amount
of noise you idiots are making.

153
00:06:53,864 --> 00:06:55,900
Here we are together.
I've got loads of 'em.

154
00:06:57,366 --> 00:06:59,896
- Doesn't prove anything.
- And do you love her, then?

155
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,976
- Fuck off.
- No denial.

156
00:07:02,144 --> 00:07:03,997
- You fucking love her.
- Shut up!

157
00:07:04,432 --> 00:07:07,336
Yeah! I thought I recognised her.
She pulled David Glover.

158
00:07:07,511 --> 00:07:10,016
- Don't be a tit, course she hasn't.
- I think she has.

159
00:07:10,395 --> 00:07:13,108
One, she's not like that,
and two, she doesn't know anyone

160
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:15,216
- from our school.
- I'll ask. Oi, David!

161
00:07:15,606 --> 00:07:17,496
- What?
- Neil, don't. Seriously, don't.

162
00:07:18,344 --> 00:07:19,446
Please don't.

163
00:07:20,529 --> 00:07:21,553
Nothing.

164
00:07:21,984 --> 00:07:22,656
Twat.

165
00:07:23,373 --> 00:07:25,736
Honestly, Neil, she doesn't
know anyone from our school.

166
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:26,896
Ask her yourself.

167
00:07:27,064 --> 00:07:29,456
We're going down the Fox and Hounds
after the last exam.

168
00:07:29,624 --> 00:07:31,856
- Come along.
- And what? Not get served?

169
00:07:32,231 --> 00:07:34,636
No, Chloe reckons she gets
served there all the time.

170
00:07:34,908 --> 00:07:37,256
- And... Wear your wellies, Neil.
- Why?

171
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:39,557
Cos you'll be knee deep
in grammar school clunge.

172
00:07:39,723 --> 00:07:42,656
<i>So, somehow, Jay had an
actual non-fictional girlfriend.</i>

173
00:07:43,104 --> 00:07:45,537
<i>But I wouldn't let it distract me
from my new revision strategy,</i>

174
00:07:45,785 --> 00:07:48,430
<i>staring at books
and praying something went in.</i>

175
00:07:52,003 --> 00:07:54,336
- Hello.
- Hello.

176
00:07:57,086 --> 00:07:58,533
Sorry about the other night.

177
00:07:58,862 --> 00:08:01,776
It's just, politics is really important
to me and it's my last exam.

178
00:08:02,222 --> 00:08:04,176
- I didn't mean to be a dick.
- You were a dick.

179
00:08:04,456 --> 00:08:06,246
Fine. Better get back to it.

180
00:08:06,946 --> 00:08:07,750
Sure.

181
00:08:10,797 --> 00:08:13,216
Why are you revising geography?
You don't do geography!

182
00:08:13,389 --> 00:08:15,176
They letting you
take an extra AS level?

183
00:08:15,463 --> 00:08:17,896
No, it's for Carli.
She just needs a bit of extra help.

184
00:08:18,069 --> 00:08:20,026
So when are you revising
for your own exams?

185
00:08:20,182 --> 00:08:22,376
You know, the ones
in the next couple of days?

186
00:08:22,549 --> 00:08:24,656
I'm not really.
I can always resit.

187
00:08:26,184 --> 00:08:27,896
- How's your revision going?
- Not bad.

188
00:08:28,064 --> 00:08:31,515
Good. Got an excellent schedule sorted,
colour-coded and balancing my time well,

189
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:33,797
got some drinks here to help,
Pro Plus that sort of thing.

190
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:34,576
Right.

191
00:08:34,744 --> 00:08:36,696
And nothing's fucking going in!

192
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:39,086
Nothing. I mean look at this...

193
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:41,336
I must have read about the
Accountability of Legislatures

194
00:08:41,504 --> 00:08:44,495
to Citizens 50 times and
I still don't know what it means!

195
00:08:44,739 --> 00:08:47,056
I'm starting to doubt if
"Legislatures" is even a word!

196
00:08:47,412 --> 00:08:49,576
It doesn't look like a word
any more, none of them do.

197
00:08:49,749 --> 00:08:52,015
They just look like
squiggles on a page!

198
00:08:53,763 --> 00:08:55,056
Is this a word?

199
00:08:56,055 --> 00:08:57,496
Yes. Council.

200
00:08:59,019 --> 00:08:59,848
Is it?

201
00:09:00,344 --> 00:09:01,696
It doesn't look right.

202
00:09:02,262 --> 00:09:04,136
I think you probably need
a bit more sleep.

203
00:09:07,582 --> 00:09:09,296
And maybe lay off
the power drinks a bit?

204
00:09:09,464 --> 00:09:12,856
These are full of electrolytes which,
if they exist, are good for my brain.

205
00:09:13,182 --> 00:09:14,569
Think of your stomach though.

206
00:09:14,652 --> 00:09:17,096
Even one of those drinks makes
my shits come out too fast.

207
00:09:17,852 --> 00:09:20,056
I'm just saying. Like rusty water.

208
00:09:20,654 --> 00:09:22,751
<i>It was a novel revision tip,
I'll give him that.</i>

209
00:09:22,834 --> 00:09:26,167
<i>But when it came to advice,
the real man to go to was Mr Cartwright.</i>

210
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:27,736
- All right, Dad?
- I'm OK.

211
00:09:28,404 --> 00:09:31,254
- Can I ask your advice about something?
- What is it, woman trouble?

212
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:32,776
Yes, it is.

213
00:09:32,944 --> 00:09:34,383
The girl from the other day?

214
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,856
- There's this guy at school, OK?
- So she's dumped you for this bloke?

215
00:09:40,024 --> 00:09:42,616
That's a lucky escape,
I thought she was a fucking pig.

216
00:09:44,027 --> 00:09:45,659
No, she hasn't dumped me, Dad.

217
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:47,896
- I think I love her.
- So you're back with her?

218
00:09:49,229 --> 00:09:52,846
Dad, we didn't split up
and please don't call her a pig.

219
00:09:53,751 --> 00:09:55,753
It's just that
I'm getting a bit jealous, cos

220
00:09:55,836 --> 00:09:58,258
I think she might have seen
a few more people than I have.

221
00:09:58,557 --> 00:10:00,765
I'd say that's a given, isn't it?
If she's got off

222
00:10:00,848 --> 00:10:03,269
with more than one person
she's beaten you hands down.

223
00:10:05,267 --> 00:10:07,934
Look mate,
women are like fairground rides.

224
00:10:08,424 --> 00:10:09,704
Fucking mental.

225
00:10:10,194 --> 00:10:12,136
Your only hope is
when she wants some,

226
00:10:12,304 --> 00:10:14,296
you do the best you can
with your tiny equipment.

227
00:10:14,732 --> 00:10:16,547
And check
where she is the whole time,

228
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:19,816
that's the only way you'll be sure
she's not sucking off this other bloke.

229
00:10:21,605 --> 00:10:22,434
Right.

230
00:10:23,211 --> 00:10:23,976
Thanks.

231
00:10:24,147 --> 00:10:25,976
Although let's face it,
she probably is.

232
00:10:27,045 --> 00:10:28,135
Fancy a beer?

233
00:10:28,707 --> 00:10:31,256
Thanks for coming round,
it's a really nice surprise.

234
00:10:31,424 --> 00:10:33,926
That's all right.
Just wanted to be near you.

235
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:35,856
Check how and where you are.

236
00:10:36,436 --> 00:10:37,366
That's sweet.

237
00:10:37,449 --> 00:10:40,208
I'll just get this last bit done
and then I'm all yours.

238
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:41,329
Cool.

239
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:46,373
- Did you pull David Glover?
- What?

240
00:10:47,252 --> 00:10:49,536
- David Glover, did you pull him?
- I don't know who that is.

241
00:10:49,704 --> 00:10:51,816
- It's just Neil said...
- Your friend Neil?

242
00:10:52,161 --> 00:10:54,896
- Yeah, do you know him, too?
- No, it's just you mention him a lot.

243
00:10:55,353 --> 00:10:56,816
Right, course.

244
00:10:58,338 --> 00:10:59,070
Anyway.

245
00:10:59,153 --> 00:11:01,136
- Do you want to come mine tomorrow?
- I can't.

246
00:11:01,418 --> 00:11:04,016
- Why, where are you going?
- Well, nowhere.

247
00:11:04,301 --> 00:11:05,496
So you'll be home then?

248
00:11:06,113 --> 00:11:08,906
Yeah.
Shouldn't you be revising as well?

249
00:11:09,447 --> 00:11:11,237
Nah, I'm not allowed to.
Teachers say cos

250
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,894
I've got a photographic memory
it wouldn't be fair on the other kids.

251
00:11:15,247 --> 00:11:18,948
<i>If Jay's made-up memory skill is a
bad revision plan, then Neil's topped it</i>

252
00:11:19,031 --> 00:11:21,669
<i>sitting on his arse
playing computer games.</i>

253
00:11:22,315 --> 00:11:26,092
Neil, I really think
you should be revising.

254
00:11:26,367 --> 00:11:27,536
I am, this is football.

255
00:11:27,704 --> 00:11:30,296
Well, what about your other
subjects, tech and design?

256
00:11:30,464 --> 00:11:33,300
- I put that shelf up, didn't up?
- Was that for your exam?

257
00:11:33,383 --> 00:11:35,496
Yeah. Well, it was 50% of it.

258
00:11:37,868 --> 00:11:40,736
<i>So, whilst Neil wasn't revising
for an exam he was taking, </i>

259
00:11:40,904 --> 00:11:43,085
<i>Simon was revising
for an exam he wasn't.</i>

260
00:11:43,461 --> 00:11:44,976
Perfect answer. You're perfect.

261
00:11:46,064 --> 00:11:46,856
At this.

262
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:49,296
God, I think I do know it. Amazing.

263
00:11:49,756 --> 00:11:51,816
You've done really,
really well. Honestly.

264
00:11:51,984 --> 00:11:54,305
I couldn't have done it
without you, thanks so much.

265
00:12:12,155 --> 00:12:14,296
- It's late, I should go.
- Sure.

266
00:12:15,265 --> 00:12:17,242
God, maybe I'll actually
pass geography now.

267
00:12:17,901 --> 00:12:19,050
Thanks again.

268
00:12:23,672 --> 00:12:25,381
<i>So, he'd finally worn her down.</i>

269
00:12:25,464 --> 00:12:28,795
<i>And Simon didn't know whether to come
in his pants or text his friends.</i>

270
00:12:29,184 --> 00:12:30,582
<i>In the end, he did both.</i>

271
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,714
<i>It was the day of my last exam, and I'd
just got in a good eight hours revision.</i>

272
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:42,676
<i>Unfortunately, it was during the eight
hours I should have been sleeping.</i>

273
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,869
What are you doing up?
I thought the politics exam

274
00:12:44,952 --> 00:12:46,913
- wasn't until this afternoon?
- Yes, but this way

275
00:12:46,996 --> 00:12:49,507
I can get a full morning of revision in.
Better to be prepared.

276
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:51,356
And I've not been to bed,
so what's early?

277
00:12:51,852 --> 00:12:54,116
I am worried about you, petal.
Have you had some breakfast?

278
00:12:54,494 --> 00:12:56,156
No, I'm a bit, you know, my stomach.

279
00:12:56,437 --> 00:12:59,651
Yes, I do know. Would it have killed you
to wipe the back of the toilet bowl?

280
00:13:00,204 --> 00:13:03,255
<i>So, while the world was falling out
of my arse, Simon was on top of it.</i>

281
00:13:03,338 --> 00:13:06,412
- I can't believe she kissed me.
- Calm down, it was only a kiss.

282
00:13:06,696 --> 00:13:09,271
Come to me when you're wanking
over her arse as she frigs herself off.

283
00:13:09,354 --> 00:13:12,556
It was two kisses actually, and she's
told me she's coming to the pub tonight

284
00:13:12,919 --> 00:13:14,356
So I reckon more's coming.

285
00:13:14,524 --> 00:13:16,116
- How's Chloe?
- Yeah, she's good.

286
00:13:16,284 --> 00:13:18,886
Not seen her a lot cos she's revising,
but I know where she's been.

287
00:13:18,969 --> 00:13:22,427
And I text her 15, 16 times a day
to keep in touch, y'know.

288
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,327
- Good idea.
- Send her facebook messages and that.

289
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:28,676
Bebo, myspace, just to let
her know I'm thinking of her.

290
00:13:29,131 --> 00:13:31,219
- Like a stalker.
- Fuck off.

291
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,553
- How's Count Spacula been getting on?
- Going mental I think.

292
00:13:34,853 --> 00:13:37,556
We'll probably see him when we finish,
his last exam is straight after ours.

293
00:13:38,141 --> 00:13:40,196
- Good luck with your PE.
- Don't forget your kit.

294
00:13:42,199 --> 00:13:43,023
Fuck.

295
00:13:47,997 --> 00:13:50,396
<i>The moment had arrived.
The last exams.</i>

296
00:13:51,844 --> 00:13:53,876
<i>Simon and Jay both knew
they had sacrificed </i>

297
00:13:54,038 --> 00:13:56,434
<i>their chances of good grades
for a shot at love.</i>

298
00:13:56,844 --> 00:13:59,216
<i>A sweet, if remarkably
short-sighted decision.</i>

299
00:13:59,558 --> 00:14:03,247
<i>While had Neil sacrificed his chances
of keeping his balls in his underpants.</i>

300
00:14:03,924 --> 00:14:07,563
<i>But then, for them, it was all over,
bar one last bollocking from Gilbert.</i>

301
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:10,565
I checked your texts
and despite almost making me vomit

302
00:14:10,648 --> 00:14:13,436
they obviously weren't about the exam.
Count yourself lucky.

303
00:14:14,059 --> 00:14:15,534
I was texting a girl, sir.

304
00:14:15,925 --> 00:14:17,672
Well, good luck with her Cartwright.

305
00:14:17,947 --> 00:14:21,122
All I can say is she can't be too keen
cos it didn't buzz once.

306
00:14:21,478 --> 00:14:24,316
Now piss off and let me get
this final piece of hell over with.

307
00:14:25,804 --> 00:14:29,876
- Fuck me, it's Shaun of the dead.
- You look dreadful mate, really tired.

308
00:14:30,038 --> 00:14:32,261
Why do you think
I'm drinking these energy drinks?

309
00:14:32,343 --> 00:14:34,564
- They perk me up.
- Have you washed?

310
00:14:34,878 --> 00:14:38,339
You can't revise in the shower,
Jay, the books get wet!

311
00:14:38,924 --> 00:14:41,676
Do us a favour and have a shower
before tonight. Seven at mine.

312
00:14:42,189 --> 00:14:43,900
- You betcha.
- Right.

313
00:14:44,124 --> 00:14:46,276
- See you later.
- Good luck, stinky.

314
00:14:46,444 --> 00:14:49,490
<i>It was the most important exam
of my life, and as I sat there,</i>

315
00:14:49,573 --> 00:14:53,007
<i>two thoughts occurred to me.
The first was, "What's the point?"</i>

316
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:55,948
<i>Seriously? I mean,
what is the point in being alive?</i>

317
00:14:56,136 --> 00:14:58,754
<i>And secondly, I really need a shit.</i>

318
00:15:04,724 --> 00:15:07,316
- What is it now, MacKenzie?
- Sir, I need to go to the toilet.

319
00:15:07,477 --> 00:15:08,687
- Again?
- Yes.

320
00:15:09,044 --> 00:15:10,473
- Well, you can't.
- I'm sorry?

321
00:15:10,556 --> 00:15:13,116
That will be the fourth time in a hour.
You'll have to wait.

322
00:15:13,284 --> 00:15:15,325
I'm pretty sure
you can't do that, sir.

323
00:15:15,408 --> 00:15:17,740
If I have reason to believe
you're cheating I can.

324
00:15:17,956 --> 00:15:21,156
And I do, so I have.
Now get on with your paper.

325
00:15:25,077 --> 00:15:26,123
Oh, God, no.

326
00:15:41,837 --> 00:15:43,186
Jesus.

327
00:15:44,605 --> 00:15:46,212
I thought it was a fart, sir.

328
00:15:46,699 --> 00:15:48,130
I thought it was safe!

329
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:51,563
<i>In a term of low-points, this was it.
Literally the bottom.</i>

330
00:15:51,646 --> 00:15:54,629
<i>Yet as I waddled to the toilet,
I felt strangely optimistic.</i>

331
00:15:54,712 --> 00:15:55,956
<i>Things couldn't get worse.</i>

332
00:15:56,116 --> 00:15:58,360
<i>Painful as it may seem, in a way,
I was free.</i>

333
00:15:58,443 --> 00:16:00,850
<i>Free to reinvent myself
as whatever I wanted.</i>

334
00:16:00,933 --> 00:16:02,845
<i>Right after I changed my underpants.</i>

335
00:16:03,612 --> 00:16:05,157
<i>At least I still had my friends,</i>

336
00:16:05,239 --> 00:16:08,063
<i>who waited a whole 10 minutes
before going to the pub without me.</i>

337
00:16:08,146 --> 00:16:10,181
What's happened?
Will's not normally late.

338
00:16:10,264 --> 00:16:12,516
He's normally irritatingly early.
I hope he's OK.

339
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,596
He's probably on the net looking up
the answers to exam questions.

340
00:16:15,756 --> 00:16:17,451
- And then having a wank.
- What?

341
00:16:17,884 --> 00:16:19,076
It's impossible, innit?

342
00:16:19,244 --> 00:16:22,116
I don't think I've ever been on the net
and not ended up having a wank.

343
00:16:22,284 --> 00:16:26,236
- You think Chloe and Carli will get on?
- Yes, it'll be like a cool double date.

344
00:16:26,404 --> 00:16:29,187
- Ending with both of us getting some.
- Maybe they'll lez off?

345
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:31,716
Neil, I've told you.
This is your last warning.

346
00:16:32,834 --> 00:16:35,676
- Do you think you'll get served here?
- Course. I've got ID.

347
00:16:36,968 --> 00:16:38,436
- G'day.
- What can I get you?

348
00:16:38,917 --> 00:16:41,269
- Two jars of lager and a coke.
- Stella all right?

349
00:16:43,441 --> 00:16:44,259
Cheers.

350
00:16:44,515 --> 00:16:46,306
- Fucking hell.
- Nice!

351
00:16:47,404 --> 00:16:49,996
The one time we get served
and I'm driving. Bollocks.

352
00:16:50,164 --> 00:16:52,054
It'll be better to be sober
when you see Carli.

353
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:53,476
I mean, Chloe prefers it.

354
00:16:53,644 --> 00:16:55,691
You know what I used
to be like with the old drink.

355
00:16:58,327 --> 00:16:59,117
Hello!

356
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:02,316
Fuck me. I thought you dressed
like a twat normally,

357
00:17:02,484 --> 00:17:04,051
but, even for you, that's shit.

358
00:17:04,444 --> 00:17:06,636
- Where have you been?
- Just finished my exam.

359
00:17:06,794 --> 00:17:09,475
- It started six hours ago.
- I was a bit delayed.

360
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:12,867
You look mental.
Take your tie off at least.

361
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:14,800
Why are you wearing
tracksuit bottoms?

362
00:17:14,883 --> 00:17:16,706
The tracksuit bottoms
are from lost property,

363
00:17:16,789 --> 00:17:19,156
as are my new underpants,
which I won't show you.

364
00:17:19,324 --> 00:17:20,599
And what's in that bag?

365
00:17:21,034 --> 00:17:24,446
Well, in there are the trousers
and pants I wore to school this morning.

366
00:17:24,529 --> 00:17:26,476
What? Are you doing
a fashion show or something?

367
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,269
It's a long story, Neil,
but the salient facts are these:

368
00:17:29,352 --> 00:17:31,876
recently, I've had a nervy tummy,
due to stress, I think.

369
00:17:32,044 --> 00:17:33,910
And all the energy drinks
and Pro Plus.

370
00:17:33,993 --> 00:17:37,116
Perhaps. And in the exam
I took a risk and it backfired.

371
00:17:37,539 --> 00:17:39,823
I went to fart and, instead,

372
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:41,398
shit myself.

373
00:17:43,281 --> 00:17:44,903
- You're joking.
- No, I'm not.

374
00:17:45,194 --> 00:17:46,726
- In front of everyone?
- Yep.

375
00:17:47,434 --> 00:17:48,459
Oh, my God.

376
00:17:48,964 --> 00:17:51,810
Yes. And because of my high heart rate,
the school nurse spent three hours

377
00:17:51,893 --> 00:17:54,756
calming me down before I went back
into an empty exam hall to finish.

378
00:17:54,924 --> 00:17:56,516
Hence I am late. Apologies.

379
00:17:56,818 --> 00:17:58,276
- And how did you?
- I think

380
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:01,276
I might have failed, Neil.
I was a bit distracted.

381
00:18:01,561 --> 00:18:04,436
Why didn't you go home and change?
People will take the piss, mate.

382
00:18:04,604 --> 00:18:08,350
Just to reiterate, I loudly shit myself
in front of the school.

383
00:18:08,871 --> 00:18:10,185
I can't hide it.

384
00:18:10,268 --> 00:18:12,326
Life doesn't get much more
embarrassing than that.

385
00:18:12,409 --> 00:18:14,516
This get-up is a mere fly
in the ointment.

386
00:18:14,684 --> 00:18:16,034
Have you gone mad?

387
00:18:16,114 --> 00:18:18,635
Possibly, hard to tell.
Drinks, anyone?

388
00:18:19,444 --> 00:18:22,407
<i>Now, what could make this day worse?
Oh, yeah. Not getting served.</i>

389
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:25,166
- Hello. Could I have a pint of lager?
- Stella?

390
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:28,796
Sorry, you may have misheard.
I said I'd like a pint of lager.

391
00:18:28,953 --> 00:18:31,316
- Yeah. Stella?
- Yes. Right.

392
00:18:32,301 --> 00:18:35,023
- Well. What if I want two pints?
- Two pints?

393
00:18:36,651 --> 00:18:37,639
There you go.

394
00:18:40,146 --> 00:18:41,250
What about this?

395
00:18:48,121 --> 00:18:50,827
- He's going to get drunk, I reckon.
- Be dressed like that is weird enough,

396
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:53,316
but that bag's got
his shitty clothes in it.

397
00:18:53,484 --> 00:18:55,676
No-one brings a bag of shit
to a pub.

398
00:18:55,844 --> 00:18:57,316
- Your dad does.
- Does he?

399
00:18:58,299 --> 00:18:59,131
Your mum.

400
00:18:59,809 --> 00:19:00,596
Brilliant!

401
00:19:07,743 --> 00:19:09,356
That'll be £6.20, please.

402
00:19:09,524 --> 00:19:10,585
Interesting.

403
00:19:11,385 --> 00:19:12,956
I'll have another pint then, please.

404
00:19:13,112 --> 00:19:14,316
- Hi Jay.
- Chloe!

405
00:19:14,484 --> 00:19:17,596
Darling, this is Neil and Simon.
This is Chloe.

406
00:19:17,764 --> 00:19:19,396
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

407
00:19:19,552 --> 00:19:21,453
- Do you want a drink, babes?
- Actually, Jay,

408
00:19:21,536 --> 00:19:24,013
- could we go and have a chat outside?
- Yeah, course.

409
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:25,596
I only want to be with you anyway.

410
00:19:25,917 --> 00:19:27,697
I see these twats all the time.

411
00:19:28,164 --> 00:19:30,175
Yeah, go on. Muff before mates.

412
00:19:30,804 --> 00:19:32,097
Just the two of us then.

413
00:19:32,616 --> 00:19:35,276
- And Will.
- Yeah. Not sure he'll be joining us.

414
00:19:35,432 --> 00:19:37,081
We'll still have a laugh.
Me and you.

415
00:19:37,164 --> 00:19:39,756
- Yeah, course. Cheers, mate.
- Cheers.

416
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:43,476
Nice idea.
This is much more private.

417
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:46,116
I've been wanting
to kiss you for ages.

418
00:19:46,803 --> 00:19:48,646
- I've missed you so much.
- No, Jay.

419
00:19:49,495 --> 00:19:51,066
Listen, we need to talk.

420
00:19:51,901 --> 00:19:52,916
Yeah, I know.

421
00:19:54,622 --> 00:19:55,676
I love our talks,

422
00:19:56,009 --> 00:19:58,836
where you tell me about how you've like
fallen out with one of your mates

423
00:19:59,004 --> 00:20:01,036
and how you've made up again
later or something.

424
00:20:01,204 --> 00:20:02,756
No, I mean, talk about us.

425
00:20:04,401 --> 00:20:07,916
It's not you, it's me.
I just don't feel this is right anymore.

426
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:11,148
What's not right?
What, coming to the pub?

427
00:20:12,038 --> 00:20:13,887
- We can leave, if you like.
- No, Jay.

428
00:20:14,209 --> 00:20:15,076
Me and you.

429
00:20:16,324 --> 00:20:18,596
I just don't think it's right
we see each other anymore.

430
00:20:19,142 --> 00:20:21,236
I think you're a bit
too sensitive for me.

431
00:20:22,268 --> 00:20:24,436
No, I'm not. I'm really not.

432
00:20:24,971 --> 00:20:26,796
- I promise you.
- You are for me.

433
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:29,097
And you're a bit needy,
it's scared me.

434
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,916
I'm not ready
for that kind of thing.

435
00:20:31,269 --> 00:20:34,516
All the texting, all the calls,
it's too intense, it's too much.

436
00:20:37,058 --> 00:20:38,316
I can change. I'll change.

437
00:20:39,381 --> 00:20:41,909
You know,
I won't call for ages, for weeks.

438
00:20:43,327 --> 00:20:45,796
You know, tell me what you want me
to be and I'll be exactly that.

439
00:20:45,964 --> 00:20:47,479
I'll be exactly that. Just...

440
00:20:48,189 --> 00:20:49,556
Please don't split up with me.

441
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:52,356
I'm sorry, Jay,
I've made up my mind.

442
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:55,189
I hope we can be friends.

443
00:20:57,634 --> 00:20:58,636
Right. Yeah.

444
00:20:58,972 --> 00:21:00,276
- Course.
- Cool.

445
00:21:01,764 --> 00:21:03,316
Have a nice evening.
See you later.

446
00:21:15,694 --> 00:21:17,730
<i>While Jay struggled to cope
with his problems, </i>

447
00:21:17,813 --> 00:21:20,190
<i>I'd found an excellent way
to deal with mine.</i>

448
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,436
This is fantastic.

449
00:21:22,944 --> 00:21:25,426
No wonder so many people
drink away their whole lives.

450
00:21:25,509 --> 00:21:27,596
Barkeep, another pint, please.

451
00:21:27,817 --> 00:21:28,596
Sure.

452
00:21:28,764 --> 00:21:30,449
<i>So while I gave my liver a kicking,</i>

453
00:21:30,532 --> 00:21:32,748
<i>Simon and Neil were enjoying
each other's company.</i>

454
00:21:34,852 --> 00:21:36,817
- Why don't we go and...
- Hold on a second.

455
00:21:40,853 --> 00:21:41,815
Hi, Simon.

456
00:21:43,687 --> 00:21:44,408
Hi.

457
00:21:45,061 --> 00:21:46,765
- I've made you a CD.
- Right.

458
00:21:46,848 --> 00:21:48,396
- Thanks.
- It's nothing.

459
00:21:48,564 --> 00:21:51,756
The songs on it do say things
I want to say, but sort of better.

460
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:53,986
Listen,
I've got to tell you something.

461
00:21:54,069 --> 00:21:55,463
Oh, God, I know. I feel it too.

462
00:21:55,546 --> 00:21:58,747
I've always felt it for years
and now it's happened and here we are.

463
00:21:58,830 --> 00:21:59,876
I'm back with Tom.

464
00:22:02,476 --> 00:22:04,396
You all right, Simon?
Get us a seat, Carls.

465
00:22:04,564 --> 00:22:05,964
I'll get the drinks in, OK?

466
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,514
You're back with Tom.

467
00:22:11,964 --> 00:22:14,076
That was what you wanted to say?
Not that you love...

468
00:22:14,244 --> 00:22:15,356
I'm really sorry.

469
00:22:17,094 --> 00:22:18,596
Do you want to join us for a drink?

470
00:22:20,137 --> 00:22:22,049
Better get back to Neil.
I left him on his own.

471
00:22:23,514 --> 00:22:25,356
I should take that CD back as well,
I think.

472
00:22:25,964 --> 00:22:27,956
- Can't I keep it?
- No, I've got to have it back.

473
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:29,660
That's a shame. It looks really...

474
00:22:30,484 --> 00:22:32,596
- Are those drawings of me?
- Not all of you.

475
00:22:32,764 --> 00:22:33,879
And is that you?

476
00:22:36,239 --> 00:22:37,069
See ya!

477
00:22:39,661 --> 00:22:41,269
Goodbye, cruel pants.

478
00:22:45,077 --> 00:22:46,407
All right, you big poof?

479
00:22:46,668 --> 00:22:47,836
Where's your bit then?

480
00:22:47,988 --> 00:22:50,556
I thought you'd be out here
up to your nuts in guts.

481
00:22:51,221 --> 00:22:52,501
Nah. I had to,

482
00:22:53,101 --> 00:22:54,429
I had to give her the boot.

483
00:22:54,645 --> 00:22:55,493
Did you?

484
00:22:56,123 --> 00:22:58,916
- I thought you were really into her?
- Nah!

485
00:23:00,552 --> 00:23:01,516
She was like...

486
00:23:02,308 --> 00:23:03,201
Frigid.

487
00:23:03,865 --> 00:23:05,956
And...
She wouldn't have this threesome

488
00:23:06,124 --> 00:23:08,676
even though I organised it
with a top lezza model.

489
00:23:09,284 --> 00:23:10,089
And...

490
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,424
My cock was too big for her.

491
00:23:14,977 --> 00:23:16,156
It's all right, mate.

492
00:23:17,337 --> 00:23:18,687
It'll be OK.

493
00:23:24,229 --> 00:23:25,436
Have you two kissing?

494
00:23:25,893 --> 00:23:27,556
- What's wrong with Jay?
- It's OK.

495
00:23:28,401 --> 00:23:29,723
He's split up with Chloe.

496
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:32,996
- I dumped her.
- Make sure you tell people that.

497
00:23:35,308 --> 00:23:37,476
- Yeah, course, mate.
- What, even though it isn't true?

498
00:23:38,992 --> 00:23:40,676
Come on, let's go.
This place is cursed.

499
00:23:41,198 --> 00:23:42,316
My God. It's haunted?

500
00:23:43,023 --> 00:23:44,956
- No, Neil.
- Well, it might be.

501
00:23:45,247 --> 00:23:47,716
Like one of those ghost stories,
Harry Potter or the Bible.

502
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:50,996
Maybe I could have one more pint?
I did shit myself at school today.

503
00:23:51,146 --> 00:23:53,240
- No, we're off.
- What about Carli?

504
00:23:53,386 --> 00:23:55,538
- She dumped him.
- I wasn't dumped. It was...

505
00:23:55,618 --> 00:23:57,040
It was more a mutual decision.

506
00:23:57,374 --> 00:23:59,800
She mutually decided
she fancied her boyfriend more?

507
00:24:01,138 --> 00:24:02,200
Come on, Jay.

508
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:06,719
- Come on, mate. You'll be all right.
- We'll get you some chips.

509
00:24:09,361 --> 00:24:12,011
I think now's a good time to tell
you I'll probably puke in your car.

510
00:24:12,091 --> 00:24:13,880
- Great!
- Don't worry.

511
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,075
It won't make this shit heap
any worse.

512
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,400
- Shotgun!
- You've perked up.

513
00:24:18,546 --> 00:24:20,920
Yeah, well, I suppose
there's plenty more clunge in the sea.

514
00:24:21,323 --> 00:24:22,160
That's it.

515
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,200
Top year next year,
so we'll pick the birds.

516
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:27,160
- Yeah.
- God, next term.

517
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,564
Anyone's going to remember
my accident, right?

518
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:31,876
Yes. Of course they will.

519
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,200
Well, they won't call you
Briefcase Mong anymore.

520
00:24:34,787 --> 00:24:37,000
- That's good.
- No, they'll call you Shitpants Mong.

521
00:24:37,685 --> 00:24:40,120
- Or Shitty Shitty Bang Bang.
- Any more?

522
00:24:40,265 --> 00:24:41,991
Wayne Pooney. Take Shat.

523
00:24:42,583 --> 00:24:43,310
Dr Poo.

524
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:45,520
The Lion, The Witch
and The Specky Kid Who Shit Himself.

525
00:24:46,737 --> 00:24:49,240
- We can keep this up all summer.
- Brilliant. Looking forward to it.

526
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:53,917
Brad Shit.

527
00:24:53,997 --> 00:24:56,160
- Bumlog Millionaire!
- All right!

528
00:24:56,821 --> 00:24:58,807
- How about Vladimir Pootin?
- Who?

529
00:24:59,305 --> 00:25:59,739
