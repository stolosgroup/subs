2
00:00:21,669 --> 00:00:24,040
<i>Wouldn't it be good to know
exactly how unpopular you are</i>

3
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,592
<i>with the opposite sex compared
to your classmates?</i>

4
00:00:26,712 --> 00:00:29,405
<i>Luckily for me,
someone invented Valentines Day,</i>

5
00:00:29,525 --> 00:00:31,421
<i>my favourite annual humiliation.</i>

6
00:00:31,541 --> 00:00:33,746
"Roses are red, violets are blue,

7
00:00:34,013 --> 00:00:36,761
your dong is massive,
I want to blow you.

8
00:00:36,881 --> 00:00:38,740
Love from your secret slut."

9
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:41,040
I didn't get none.
I can't believe you got so many.

10
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,394
Yes, it is hard to believe.

11
00:00:43,514 --> 00:00:44,606
"Dear Jay....

12
00:00:45,397 --> 00:00:49,720
"I've just baked you a finger pie,
why don't you cum..." Spelt C-U-M.

13
00:00:50,403 --> 00:00:51,480
"... and taste it?"

14
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,800
That's so horny.
Who do you think it's from?

15
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,383
- Your dad?
- Yeah, funny.

16
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,759
Let me look at these.

17
00:00:58,206 --> 00:01:02,320
"Jay, you massive stud,
please, please spaff on my tits.

18
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,152
From your Valentine's bitch.
PS: And on my face."

19
00:01:06,272 --> 00:01:09,050
That's my favourite, I like
the way she remembered the face.

20
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:12,280
It's funny how all these cards seem
to be in the same handwriting.

21
00:01:12,807 --> 00:01:16,316
Your admirers are either very young
or have severe learning difficulties.

22
00:01:16,436 --> 00:01:17,520
Which is possible.

23
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,029
The handwriting's bad cos they were
strumming one out as they wrote 'em.

24
00:01:21,149 --> 00:01:22,920
Not you writing with your left hand?

25
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,560
You're just jealous cos I got loads
and you got none.

26
00:01:26,192 --> 00:01:28,840
- I got a card.
- If it's your nan it doesn't count.

27
00:01:29,685 --> 00:01:32,280
- I didn't get any then.
- I did get a card. A proper one.

28
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,097
- Total bollocks.
- Yeah?

29
00:01:34,405 --> 00:01:36,360
- What do you call this then?
- Interesting!

30
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,040
- Wow. Who's that from?
- Hannah Fields in the year below.

31
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:41,244
Sniff it to see if she rubbed
her fanny on it.

32
00:01:41,364 --> 00:01:42,125
Neil!

33
00:01:43,855 --> 00:01:45,324
Na, just a bit of perfume.

34
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:47,200
So what are you going to do
about it?

35
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,966
Nothing. Apart from making
sure Carli doesn't find out.

36
00:01:50,191 --> 00:01:52,920
I think she'll be too busy sucking
on her boyfriend's knob.

37
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,500
- Shut up.
- What?

38
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:57,128
All I'm saying is, he'll have
his cock right deep in her gob

39
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:59,520
and then in her vag.
Out the vag, back in the gob.

40
00:02:00,255 --> 00:02:01,081
Thanks!

41
00:02:01,379 --> 00:02:04,006
Oh, yeah, that reminds me.
Give that to your mum for us.

42
00:02:05,706 --> 00:02:06,945
Are you serious?

43
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,468
- Oh, you are.
- Don't tell her who it's from.

44
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:12,265
No, course not. Anything else, Neil?

45
00:02:12,385 --> 00:02:14,509
- Would you like me to ask her out?
- Would you?

46
00:02:14,853 --> 00:02:16,551
Let me think. Would I?

47
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:18,720
No. No, I fucking wouldn't.

48
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,440
Good morning. And shut up.

49
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:26,320
Right everyone, your work-experience
placements have been finalised.

50
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,720
And as 99% of you left it
to the careers officer,

51
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,320
I don't want to hear whingeing
about where you're heading.

52
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,600
Sir. There seems to be some mistake.

53
00:02:35,445 --> 00:02:38,320
Is the mistake you choosing to
ignore me saying "No whingeing"?

54
00:02:38,982 --> 00:02:41,449
No, sir, it says here
I'm going to work at a garage.

55
00:02:41,747 --> 00:02:42,482
Yes.

56
00:02:42,718 --> 00:02:43,674
Come on.

57
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,690
Me.

58
00:02:45,001 --> 00:02:45,914
A garage?

59
00:02:46,339 --> 00:02:48,600
- Does that seem likely?
- What's your point?

60
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,928
I wrote to the local paper.
To shadow a journalist there.

61
00:02:51,048 --> 00:02:52,970
Maybe even write
a few pieces myself.

62
00:02:53,345 --> 00:02:56,924
Right, let me have a look. I don't
get paid extra for this, you know.

63
00:02:57,906 --> 00:03:01,336
OK, it says here that Sutherland
is expected at the newspaper.

64
00:03:01,456 --> 00:03:03,362
- Case closed.
- Well, then

65
00:03:03,482 --> 00:03:06,712
there's clearly been some sort of
mix-up. I don't mean to be rude but...

66
00:03:07,358 --> 00:03:08,520
... look at him.

67
00:03:09,053 --> 00:03:10,811
- No offence.
- None taken.

68
00:03:11,017 --> 00:03:12,720
What was your first
choice, Sutherland?

69
00:03:13,102 --> 00:03:14,295
Airplane driver.

70
00:03:14,415 --> 00:03:16,433
- And that is...?
- Someone who drives planes.

71
00:03:16,553 --> 00:03:18,160
- You mean a pilot.
- Do I?

72
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:21,042
- What was your second choice?
- Working with cars.

73
00:03:21,162 --> 00:03:23,606
Right. Ever wanted to work
at a newspaper?

74
00:03:23,893 --> 00:03:24,781
No, sir.

75
00:03:25,024 --> 00:03:27,400
- Have you ever read a newspaper?
- Not really.

76
00:03:28,487 --> 00:03:31,920
OK, it does seem there's been
some sort of mistake here somewhere.

77
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,174
That's OK, mistakes happen.
Shall I go the paper tomorrow?

78
00:03:39,124 --> 00:03:41,280
You go to the garage.
It's all booked.

79
00:03:41,561 --> 00:03:42,735
Is this a joke?

80
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:45,240
Do I make a lot of jokes?

81
00:03:45,667 --> 00:03:48,320
- But sir...
- I can't change the placements.

82
00:03:48,789 --> 00:03:50,349
Can't or won't?

83
00:03:52,451 --> 00:03:55,011
You pick. It's the same result.

84
00:03:58,037 --> 00:03:59,028
Sutherland?

85
00:03:59,386 --> 00:04:01,625
Does this mean I won't
be driving any planes?

86
00:04:05,397 --> 00:04:08,480
This is a fuck-up. What experience
will I get at a garage?

87
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,841
Apart from a depressing
working-class one?

88
00:04:10,961 --> 00:04:12,600
You get to look at horny calendars.

89
00:04:12,868 --> 00:04:16,095
Why work for a paper? I thought you
were going into the family business.

90
00:04:16,215 --> 00:04:17,720
- Which is...?
- Prostitution.

91
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,920
Yep, nice one.

92
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:23,280
It'll be shit anyway. The clue's
in the name - work experience.

93
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,584
It won't be shit at my dad's firm.
When I worked there last summer,

94
00:04:27,704 --> 00:04:30,191
I spent every day jumping JCBs
over cement mixers.

95
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:32,715
- Well, that's a lie.
- And I got paid a grand at the end.

96
00:04:32,835 --> 00:04:34,560
- Another lie!
- I had a wank earlier

97
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,963
- about your mum's tits. Is that alie?
- I hope so.

98
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:38,571
- It's not.
- Oh, good.

99
00:04:38,691 --> 00:04:41,120
- Sorry, mate.
- I ain't your fucking mate!

100
00:04:41,776 --> 00:04:42,823
He's touchy.

101
00:04:42,943 --> 00:04:44,816
It's probably cos
he's such a short arse!

102
00:04:44,936 --> 00:04:46,451
- What d'you say?
- What?

103
00:04:46,571 --> 00:04:49,680
- He's taking the piss, Danny.
- Yeah? I'll fucking do you.

104
00:04:50,202 --> 00:04:51,643
- Yeah, whatever.
- Wanker.

105
00:04:51,763 --> 00:04:53,890
- What's his problem?
- Ooh, don't cry, Simon!

106
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:55,193
Yeah, good one.

107
00:04:56,899 --> 00:04:58,400
Um, catch up in a bit.

108
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,279
Oh, that's right, run after her,
that's not creepy!

109
00:05:04,233 --> 00:05:06,670
<i>I may not have received
any Valentine's cards,</i>

110
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:08,910
<i>but that didn't mean
I hadn't sent any.</i>

111
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,017
Charlotte!

112
00:05:10,137 --> 00:05:11,240
Oh, hello.

113
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,614
Happy Valentine's day.
Did you get any cards?

114
00:05:13,734 --> 00:05:14,920
Yeah, maybe ten?

115
00:05:15,474 --> 00:05:16,231
Ten?

116
00:05:17,207 --> 00:05:18,468
Yeah, me too.

117
00:05:18,721 --> 00:05:19,440
But,

118
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,040
did you get any flowers?

119
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,840
I think you know I did.
I thought it was really sweet,

120
00:05:24,299 --> 00:05:27,520
and I was gonna say, if you're not
busy, we could hang out this Friday?

121
00:05:28,321 --> 00:05:29,732
I think I'm free.

122
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:31,797
Yep, yes I am.

123
00:05:32,264 --> 00:05:35,122
I'm working on the bar at a
local Valentine's disco thing.

124
00:05:35,242 --> 00:05:37,148
It's under-18s,
so it might be a bit lame,

125
00:05:37,268 --> 00:05:39,080
but if you fancied
keeping me company?

126
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,390
A date?

127
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:42,154
No, Will, not a date.

128
00:05:42,447 --> 00:05:44,050
Just two friends hanging out.

129
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:46,040
Great. See you Friday.
It's a date.

130
00:05:46,709 --> 00:05:48,104
No, it's not a date.

131
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,162
Cool.

132
00:05:49,418 --> 00:05:53,130
<i>She said it wasn't a date, but
we both knew it was. Before that,</i>

133
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,834
<i>I had to make the most of my new,
pointless, shitty manual job.</i>

134
00:05:55,954 --> 00:05:56,968
Hellooooo?

135
00:05:59,464 --> 00:06:02,285
Will MacKenzie,
I'm here for work experience.

136
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,515
Hello, you must be Will.
Great to meet you, I'm Jim.

137
00:06:05,954 --> 00:06:07,738
This here's Wolfie and Steve.

138
00:06:07,944 --> 00:06:10,379
Hi, Jim, hi, Steve, hello, Wolf.

139
00:06:10,658 --> 00:06:11,539
Wolf-ie.

140
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,320
Wolfie, right, gotcha.

141
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:16,283
You'll have a right laugh. Long as
you don't mind a bit of blue talk.

142
00:06:16,403 --> 00:06:17,960
- Not a poof, are ya?
- No.

143
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,335
Not a problem if you are, just be
harder to join in some of the banter.

144
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,520
Any part of car mechanics
you're interested in, as it goes?

145
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,560
To be honest,
none of it... as it goes.

146
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,221
- More interested in bikes, is it?
- No, the media. Or law.

147
00:06:30,726 --> 00:06:33,766
Look, no offence, but I'm never
going to work in a place like this.

148
00:06:33,886 --> 00:06:36,880
- Place like this?
- You know, a place like this.

149
00:06:37,316 --> 00:06:38,865
Manual, dirty.

150
00:06:39,226 --> 00:06:42,371
Not stupid exactly, but not academic
by a long chalk!

151
00:06:42,491 --> 00:06:43,992
It's not that I'm better than this,

152
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:46,887
it's just that I am much cleverer
than you need to be to work here.

153
00:06:47,578 --> 00:06:48,988
Steve here's got a BTEC.

154
00:06:49,164 --> 00:06:52,520
Exactly. I suspect the mix-up'll be
sorted today, I'll be gone tomorrow.

155
00:06:52,835 --> 00:06:55,040
I see. You don't mind
helping out today then?

156
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,840
No, course not. Just the once, eh?

157
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,267
Right, Cholmondley-Warner.

158
00:06:58,387 --> 00:07:00,800
We need some stuff picking up
from the suppliers.

159
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,849
Fine. I'll just get a pen and paper.

160
00:07:05,503 --> 00:07:06,325
Great.

161
00:07:06,445 --> 00:07:08,520
OK, we need two tins
of tartan paint.

162
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:11,117
Tartan paint times two.

163
00:07:11,237 --> 00:07:14,645
- Spirit level bubbles.
- Bubbles for spirit level.

164
00:07:14,765 --> 00:07:17,862
- D'you need anything, Wolfie?
- Yeah, ask him for a reach around.

165
00:07:17,982 --> 00:07:20,410
- A reach around.
- Don't forget you really need that.

166
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:23,120
Fine. So it's two tins
of tartan paint,

167
00:07:23,469 --> 00:07:25,924
bubbles for spirit level and...

168
00:07:26,044 --> 00:07:27,409
a reach around.

169
00:07:27,529 --> 00:07:29,572
Might as well ask for a long wait
while you're there.

170
00:07:29,692 --> 00:07:30,400
Great!

171
00:07:36,901 --> 00:07:38,662
... this is a joke, isn't it?

172
00:07:38,782 --> 00:07:40,680
- What?
- These items...

173
00:07:41,234 --> 00:07:44,040
they're not real things,
are they? They don't exist.

174
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,848
- I don't know what you mean.
- Now,

175
00:07:45,968 --> 00:07:50,035
I know that these initiation ceremonies
exist in certain types of workplace,

176
00:07:50,155 --> 00:07:52,914
and, don't get me wrong,
I enjoy the camaraderie,

177
00:07:53,034 --> 00:07:55,210
but you have to get up
pretty early to fool me.

178
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:57,560
- No, fair enough, you caught us out.
- Yeah, fair cop.

179
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,877
Too sharp for us!
I tell you what,

180
00:07:59,997 --> 00:08:02,082
why don't we initiate you
with a pint at lunch?

181
00:08:02,202 --> 00:08:03,650
- Good.
- We'll go to the Crown,

182
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:06,000
barmaid in there's got
a smashing pair of tits.

183
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:08,125
OK!

184
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:12,142
<i>So, while I was getting
a City and Guilds in tits,</i>

185
00:08:12,262 --> 00:08:16,132
<i>Neil was at the newspaper, happily
wasting the opportunity of my lifetime.</i>

186
00:08:16,898 --> 00:08:18,988
Toby, your work experience is here.

187
00:08:20,801 --> 00:08:23,063
Fine... All right.

188
00:08:25,126 --> 00:08:27,974
- Hi, you must be Neil, I'm Toby.
- All right?

189
00:08:28,456 --> 00:08:31,560
So, what are you looking
to get out of this assignment, Neil?

190
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,400
Don't worry, I won't steal nothing.

191
00:08:38,467 --> 00:08:41,796
What I meant was, is there anything
specifically you'd like to do here,

192
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:44,279
or an area of journalism you're
particularly interested in?

193
00:08:44,621 --> 00:08:45,780
No, not really.

194
00:08:46,273 --> 00:08:47,080
Right.

195
00:08:47,805 --> 00:08:51,200
And do you have any questions
you'd like to ask me about anything?

196
00:08:51,705 --> 00:08:53,040
How long's my lunch hour?

197
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:55,080
An hour.

198
00:08:58,323 --> 00:09:01,857
<i>Meanwhile, Jay really had arranged
some great work experience for Simon,</i>

199
00:09:01,977 --> 00:09:04,724
<i>freezing his arse off at a
disgusting plant-hire yard.</i>

200
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:06,809
This is shit. I don't wanna
do this for a living.

201
00:09:06,929 --> 00:09:09,776
Nah, it's all right! We'll be able
to drive the diggers soon, I reckon.

202
00:09:09,896 --> 00:09:13,706
Jay? Why have you stopped?
This is work experience,

203
00:09:13,826 --> 00:09:16,563
not standing-around-being-a-useless-twat
experience.

204
00:09:16,683 --> 00:09:19,480
You don't need any experience
at that - you're the expert!

205
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,686
Sorry, Dad, we only stopped for
a moment. This is well knackering.

206
00:09:22,806 --> 00:09:25,095
You'd better get used to it,
cos with your brains

207
00:09:25,215 --> 00:09:28,240
you'll be fucking lucky to get a job
throwing shit into a skip!

208
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,110
This isn't exactly
how you described it.

209
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:33,237
Get many Valentine's cards, Simon?

210
00:09:33,357 --> 00:09:35,480
- Just the one.
- One more than Jay's ever got.

211
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,496
- I got plenty.
- Don't worry,

212
00:09:37,616 --> 00:09:39,286
there's a girl out there for you.

213
00:09:39,406 --> 00:09:42,293
You just need to find a desperate
bird that likes the smell of BO

214
00:09:42,413 --> 00:09:43,880
and blokes with tiny cocks!

215
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,611
Now get back to work,

216
00:09:46,731 --> 00:09:49,383
I ain't paying you to sit
on your scrawny arse.

217
00:09:49,503 --> 00:09:50,288
Nice.

218
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,360
- All right?
- What are you doing here?

219
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,496
- I thought you should be at work?
- They let me go home at lunch.

220
00:09:55,616 --> 00:09:57,276
You jammy bastard.

221
00:09:57,396 --> 00:10:00,240
Si, what's all this I hear about
you having a fight with Danny Moore?

222
00:10:00,525 --> 00:10:02,658
What?! Who's Danny Moore?

223
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,640
He's been talking about
a beating on you.

224
00:10:04,984 --> 00:10:05,871
Who is he?

225
00:10:06,222 --> 00:10:08,242
- I don't know who he is!
- That kid you bumped into

226
00:10:08,362 --> 00:10:10,240
- and then called a shortarse.
- That was Jay.

227
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,328
You'll have to go and knock
him out now.

228
00:10:12,448 --> 00:10:14,098
- Teach him a lesson.
- If you see him,

229
00:10:14,218 --> 00:10:16,301
- tell him it's a mistake.
- I'm not getting involved.

230
00:10:16,421 --> 00:10:19,000
He's from a hard family in
Northwood. His brother did time.

231
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,480
Oh, Northwood?
Been nice knowing you, Si!

232
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,600
What's this, my dad's bigger
than your dad? What are we, 12?

233
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,303
- I think he is 12, actually.
- You're not scared are you, Si?

234
00:10:28,423 --> 00:10:30,728
No, it's just I'm not going
to look cool beating up a kid.

235
00:10:30,848 --> 00:10:33,836
- And you couldn't.
- Yes, I could, can we just leave it?

236
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:35,637
I'm not fighting anyone.

237
00:10:39,053 --> 00:10:40,926
Oh yeah, nice one.

238
00:10:42,905 --> 00:10:43,851
Mature.

239
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,284
<i>Compared to Simon, my first day
was turning out OK.</i>

240
00:10:47,404 --> 00:10:49,305
<i>After a morning
of pretending cars were broken</i>

241
00:10:49,425 --> 00:10:52,735
<i>and overcharging middle-class women,
we had bonded over a pint.</i>

242
00:10:52,995 --> 00:10:55,657
Thanks, guys. That was a much more
civilised way to welcome me.

243
00:10:55,777 --> 00:10:57,653
It's shame we won't
get to do it again...

244
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,680
Oh, no! A kidnap?! What are you,
the cockney Al-Qaeda?

245
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,960
Don't shit yourself,
we're going for a drive.

246
00:11:06,715 --> 00:11:09,000
- Hello, mate!
- Come on, is this really necessary?

247
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,960
What about my allergies?!
Let's talk about this.

248
00:11:13,008 --> 00:11:14,856
Please! My allergies!

249
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,000
Wasn't expecting that,
was you, mastermind?!

250
00:11:23,303 --> 00:11:24,450
See you tomorrow!

251
00:11:25,502 --> 00:11:27,720
<i>Institutionalised
bullying wasn't quite</i>

252
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:31,226
<i>the work experience I had in mind.
But I knew how to deal with bullies.</i>

253
00:11:31,346 --> 00:11:33,119
<i>I got my mum to tell the teacher.</i>

254
00:11:38,527 --> 00:11:41,476
I was hoping you'd be able to do
something about it, Mr Gilbert.

255
00:11:41,596 --> 00:11:44,760
- I'm sorry.
- I just wonder what he said to them.

256
00:11:45,132 --> 00:11:48,680
- I don't think he said anything, Kevin.
- He must have said something.

257
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:52,498
He walked back through the town
centre sopping wet and barely clothed.

258
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,019
I'd hoped you'd take this
more seriously.

259
00:11:55,139 --> 00:11:57,279
He wrote to the paper especially
to get work experience,

260
00:11:57,399 --> 00:11:59,780
and instead I'm picking
frogspawn out of his underpants.

261
00:12:00,723 --> 00:12:03,752
Would you excuse me
just for a second?

262
00:12:17,243 --> 00:12:19,733
Ooooooooh God!

263
00:12:26,975 --> 00:12:27,744
Look,

264
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:31,320
I really want to help,
but it's not my responsability.

265
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:34,606
I will ask if they'll consider swapping
students, but I can't promise anything.

266
00:12:35,081 --> 00:12:37,956
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I do have a meeting to attend to.

267
00:12:46,345 --> 00:12:47,320
What a pickle!

268
00:12:48,297 --> 00:12:50,385
I'm not sure I should
send Neil to the garage.

269
00:12:50,505 --> 00:12:52,296
Those men sound like brutes.

270
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:54,120
I think it was just hijinks.

271
00:12:54,553 --> 00:12:59,080
What, three dirty men throwing
a naked young boy into water?

272
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,120
- The mind boggles.
- I never said Will was naked.

273
00:13:04,422 --> 00:13:05,684
I thought you did...

274
00:13:06,604 --> 00:13:08,160
<i>Not quite the outcome I'd hoped for.</i>

275
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,353
<i>Neil's dad imagining me naked.</i>

276
00:13:12,419 --> 00:13:15,115
<i>When it comes to love,
they say a gentleman never tells.</i>

277
00:13:15,235 --> 00:13:17,497
<i>But I wasn't a gentleman.
I was a twat.</i>

278
00:13:17,617 --> 00:13:19,544
Guess who got a date
with Charlotte Hinchcliffe?

279
00:13:19,664 --> 00:13:20,720
- Donovan?
- No.

280
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,400
I bet it is - he's probably
balls deep in her right now.

281
00:13:24,091 --> 00:13:25,480
The answer... is me.

282
00:13:26,207 --> 00:13:27,441
- No way.
- Yes, way.

283
00:13:28,042 --> 00:13:28,968
Of sorts.

284
00:13:29,306 --> 00:13:30,480
- Of sorts way.
- How?

285
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,600
I've no idea. Honestly, and
I'm not going to stop and ask her.

286
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,160
I don't know why she likes me but I'm
going to do my best to keep it that way.

287
00:13:37,471 --> 00:13:38,812
Sounds like a good plan.

288
00:13:39,054 --> 00:13:40,341
- When is it then?
- What?

289
00:13:40,461 --> 00:13:41,600
- Date.
- Friday.

290
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,168
- What we up to Friday?
- Same as every Friday.

291
00:13:44,288 --> 00:13:46,228
- Nothing.
- Maybe we could go.

292
00:13:46,757 --> 00:13:49,080
In what world would
I want you to come along?

293
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,960
- It's not for you, it's for us.
- It'd be funny to watch you fuck it up.

294
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,720
Yeah, you might cry.

295
00:13:54,139 --> 00:13:56,675
Thanks for the vote of confidence,
but you won't want to come.

296
00:13:56,795 --> 00:13:59,752
I'm seeing her at this under-18s night
she's working at. It will be uncool,

297
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:01,400
- even for us.
- Sounds OK to me.

298
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,567
- At least we'll definitely get in.
- No, no.

299
00:14:04,337 --> 00:14:06,371
- You won't like it.
- We might even get some.

300
00:14:06,491 --> 00:14:07,975
Won't they be a bit young?

301
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:11,480
- Grass on the pitch and it's OK for me.
- Right, and what if there isn't?

302
00:14:11,869 --> 00:14:13,800
By the time you find
out it'll be too late.

303
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:18,120
Surely you've got better things to do
than watch me with Charlotte?

304
00:14:21,285 --> 00:14:22,966
Great, no, fine. See you there then.

305
00:14:23,086 --> 00:14:25,440
<i>So before my date
with Charlotte, and it was a date,</i>

306
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,196
<i>I had to endure one
last day with the savages.</i>

307
00:14:28,316 --> 00:14:31,880
<i>I was pleasantly surprised to find Jim
and Wolfie engaged in serious debate.</i>

308
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:35,680
All right, Will? You'll like this -
we're just having "a discussion".

309
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,689
- Oh, really?
- Which titties would you spunk over?

310
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,320
The little ones, or big and bouncy?
A handful, plenty to play with.

311
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,920
- They both look nice.
- Better than tits you'll ever get mate!

312
00:14:45,694 --> 00:14:49,320
All right, I'd spunk over the big ones,
and they're not better than I'd get.

313
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,209
Bollocks. Here, Steve...

314
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,520
- Speccy here... reckons he has better!
- Stop that.

315
00:14:55,157 --> 00:14:57,480
- I have.
- Fuck off, you're a virgin!

316
00:14:57,641 --> 00:14:59,120
- Classic virgin.
- You're wrong.

317
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:02,040
I did it last year.
With a girl I'm seeing tonight.

318
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,200
Yeah, sure.

319
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,240
Yep! She's fit, she's older than me,
and she goes like a porn star.

320
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,695
- Oh, right!
- Yeah, and she's got massive titties

321
00:15:08,815 --> 00:15:09,848
and I...

322
00:15:09,968 --> 00:15:10,828
Well, I...

323
00:15:10,948 --> 00:15:12,760
fucked her hard and all night long.

324
00:15:13,683 --> 00:15:15,257
What are you and this dirty horn

325
00:15:15,377 --> 00:15:18,000
bucket up to this weekend then?
I might come and check her out.

326
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,560
Going to an under-18 disco where
she works, so you won't be able to.

327
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,840
I could go.

328
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,563
- What?
- I could go. I'm 17.

329
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,600
You're 17!?

330
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,760
- You're 17?
- Yeah, yeah - I just look older.

331
00:15:31,168 --> 00:15:33,519
There's looking older
and then there's that.

332
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:35,070
You look about 30!

333
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:36,058
Lovely!

334
00:15:36,521 --> 00:15:39,040
Wolfie'll check out this tart
you've been boning, then.

335
00:15:39,351 --> 00:15:41,200
- Good.
- Maybe Wolfie'll pull her.

336
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,614
- He won't do that because she loves me.
- She loves you?

337
00:15:44,734 --> 00:15:46,330
I'm going to cry!

338
00:15:46,803 --> 00:15:47,765
I mean...

339
00:15:48,135 --> 00:15:50,760
- She loves to fuck me.
- Yeah... Course she does.

340
00:15:53,111 --> 00:15:54,638
<i>That evening at the Civic Hall,</i>

341
00:15:54,758 --> 00:15:57,474
<i>I hoped Neil would enlighten me
about what I'd be up to next week.</i>

342
00:15:57,594 --> 00:16:01,054
<i>He'd never enlightened me about
anything before, but you never know.</i>

343
00:16:01,174 --> 00:16:03,422
How was the newspaper?
Did you write anything?

344
00:16:03,542 --> 00:16:06,590
No, nothing boring like that.
I'm on the internet most of the day,

345
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:10,212
this afternoon I smashed old desks
in a skip and then home at four.

346
00:16:17,238 --> 00:16:18,600
Are we the oldest here?

347
00:16:19,222 --> 00:16:20,140
Possibly.

348
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:22,767
It's even more shit
than I knew it would be.

349
00:16:22,887 --> 00:16:24,760
I honestly don't why you came.

350
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:28,251
- To see you get blown out by Charlotte.
- Please try not to fuck this up.

351
00:16:28,371 --> 00:16:30,614
Charlotte asked me
so there's a chance,

352
00:16:30,734 --> 00:16:33,520
admittedly a very slim chance,
that she wants to pull me.

353
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,491
Or maybe she needs
a mechanic for her car!

354
00:16:35,611 --> 00:16:37,539
- Good one!
- I'd service her all right.

355
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,400
I'd slide my dipstick in deep!

356
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,453
Thanks for coming, really appreciate it!
I'm gonna find Charlotte.

357
00:16:42,573 --> 00:16:45,769
Up to you. It looks like
there's some tidy minge here.

358
00:16:45,889 --> 00:16:48,320
Yes, it's tidy because
there's no hair on it.

359
00:16:57,264 --> 00:16:59,199
Oi, Si, Hannah Fields is over there.

360
00:17:00,361 --> 00:17:02,000
It's her who write your Valentine?

361
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,640
Oh, yeah, shit.
She looks quite fit actually.

362
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:07,022
Right, I'll go over
and tell her you fancy her.

363
00:17:07,142 --> 00:17:08,616
- No.
- Why?

364
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,713
Well,

365
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:12,163
you going over and telling her
I fancy her, seems a bit,

366
00:17:12,283 --> 00:17:13,600
y'know, childish.

367
00:17:13,942 --> 00:17:16,840
When in Rome. That's how you got
to play it with younger girls.

368
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,560
You go over...
Shit, she's coming over here.

369
00:17:21,432 --> 00:17:23,480
So did you get my
valentine's card then?

370
00:17:23,983 --> 00:17:26,480
Oh, yeah, great. Thank you.

371
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,760
- Do you want a drink?
- I've got one thanks.

372
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,427
No, I mean a proper drink.

373
00:17:30,547 --> 00:17:32,162
Oh... right. Yeah,

374
00:17:32,988 --> 00:17:33,833
thanks.

375
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:53,636
You're fit.

376
00:17:53,966 --> 00:17:55,728
- Sorry?
- Oh, forget it.

377
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,740
Come on.

378
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,600
You're well sexy, I used
to stare at you in assembly.

379
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,521
Right.

380
00:18:06,641 --> 00:18:08,400
Ooh, you're so horny. Tongue me!

381
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,958
Um, how old are you?

382
00:18:11,813 --> 00:18:13,328
Blimey, that didn't take long.

383
00:18:13,533 --> 00:18:15,600
Compared to you and
Charlotte anything's quick.

384
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,822
- Softly softly, catchee monkee.
- I didn't know you spoke Spanish.

385
00:18:18,942 --> 00:18:22,040
See! I told you this was a great
place to get your fingers stinky.

386
00:18:22,385 --> 00:18:24,200
Oh, my god, she's
going for his cock.

387
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,741
Oh, what you doing?

388
00:18:25,861 --> 00:18:27,640
Shall we go somewhere more private?

389
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,000
- I want you.
- Right.

390
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,279
Careful, no-one's touched
that before, it might go off.

391
00:18:31,399 --> 00:18:32,200
Good!

392
00:18:34,002 --> 00:18:35,560
Crikey, careful.

393
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,558
Are they allowed to do that in here?

394
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:40,280
- Crikey!
- Fuck me, she's gonna wank him off!

395
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,348
The jammy git's pulled an
experienced cock handler.

396
00:18:43,468 --> 00:18:47,880
Or, someone so inexperienced she thinks
it's the best way to pull an older boy.

397
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,600
- Either way it's a win-win situation.
- It's not really, though, no?

398
00:18:50,959 --> 00:18:53,904
Thanks to me, we're now
watching Simon get wanked off.

399
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,480
Thank you so much!

400
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,880
- Getting a bit weird now.
- I hate it when he makes eye contact.

401
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,410
None of us do, Neil.

402
00:19:16,008 --> 00:19:17,320
Call me a short arse now!

403
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,996
Come on then, you fucking coward!

404
00:19:22,663 --> 00:19:24,739
- Oh, please, not his face!
- I'm gonna do you!

405
00:19:24,859 --> 00:19:27,560
Northwood are in the house,
you're fucking dead!

406
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,062
How embarrassing.

407
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:32,680
- That was brilliant!
- Was it?

408
00:19:33,092 --> 00:19:35,040
Fucking hilarious,
he totally did you.

409
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,028
- Have they chucked him out?
- Doubt it.

410
00:19:37,148 --> 00:19:39,200
Not gonna chuck him
out for that, just a scuffle.

411
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,600
- He kicked me in the cock.
- Good shot!

412
00:19:42,483 --> 00:19:45,068
- What happened to Hannah?
- Erm, I think you blew it

413
00:19:45,188 --> 00:19:46,880
when a twelve year did beat you.

414
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,200
I fucking slipped!

415
00:19:48,914 --> 00:19:50,777
He's talking to
a load of Northwood lads.

416
00:19:50,897 --> 00:19:52,720
- What?
- They don't look twelve, to be fair.

417
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:55,920
Fucking hell Si, you muppet.
We are so dead.

418
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,835
What? Dead?
That should be the end of it!

419
00:19:57,955 --> 00:20:00,240
Simon's taken a beating,
a child's honour's been restored.

420
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,960
- I didn't take a beating!
- Yeah.

421
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,951
This is Northwood.
It's not the end, it's the start!

422
00:20:05,521 --> 00:20:07,093
- We do what now?
- I get Charlotte?

423
00:20:07,213 --> 00:20:09,675
- Is she hard?
- No, she'll get them thrown out!

424
00:20:09,795 --> 00:20:11,640
I'll go find her,
you go and hide somewhere.

425
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,320
- Hide?
- Yes, hide.

426
00:20:16,349 --> 00:20:17,928
- Toilets?
- Charlotte!

427
00:20:18,048 --> 00:20:21,760
- Someone's desperate for a diet coke!
- No, Simon's been attacked by a kid...

428
00:20:22,437 --> 00:20:24,960
Here? What did he do,
headbutt him in the knee?

429
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,360
No. Kicked him in the cock,
actually, but listen...

430
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,920
Please say you aren't asking me
to protect you from children?

431
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:31,720
Hmm, a bit.

432
00:20:32,256 --> 00:20:33,960
All right, Cholmondley-Warner?

433
00:20:34,717 --> 00:20:35,950
Is this your bird?

434
00:20:37,567 --> 00:20:39,960
Nice to meet you.
You're just like Will said you was.

435
00:20:40,455 --> 00:20:42,920
- Right. I hope that's a compliment.
- Oh, yeah it is.

436
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,215
You wouldn't mind having a quick word
with our boss Jim on the old blower, OK?

437
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,000
- Please don't.
- New friend?

438
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,120
- From work experience. A colleague.
- Jim for ya.

439
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,800
Ignore everything he says,
it's bollocks, I promise.

440
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,889
Hello. >

441
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:56,993
Right.

442
00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:00,040
No, I'm not his girlfriend, no.

443
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,560
No, we didn't have sex.

444
00:21:02,988 --> 00:21:05,800
He did, did he?
No, that didn't happen.

445
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,240
No, I'm not a porn star.

446
00:21:08,158 --> 00:21:09,558
Charlotte, listen...

447
00:21:09,678 --> 00:21:12,360
I was working in a garage.
You don't understand what it's like.

448
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,720
How many chances do you think
you'll get to be a dickhead?

449
00:21:15,325 --> 00:21:16,240
One more?

450
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,640
Wrong. You're a nasty little virgin.

451
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,120
See ya.

452
00:21:24,161 --> 00:21:25,906
Right, fair enough. OK.

453
00:21:26,026 --> 00:21:27,840
Best of a bad lot,
deal with what we've got.

454
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:30,599
I need you, we're in trouble.

455
00:21:30,719 --> 00:21:33,208
I'm off. Only popped in
to check out your missus.

456
00:21:33,328 --> 00:21:36,080
Well, thanks for popping by
and ruining my love life.

457
00:21:36,527 --> 00:21:37,440
No problem.

458
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,440
I hope you and your ignorant boss
get a good laugh out of it.

459
00:21:40,792 --> 00:21:42,582
I'll tell you who'll
be laughing last!

460
00:21:42,702 --> 00:21:45,651
Me! Cos I'm not the one who'll
be working in a shitty garage

461
00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:48,320
doing manual labour
for the rest of my life.

462
00:21:48,923 --> 00:21:50,012
See you Monday.

463
00:21:50,929 --> 00:21:52,009
No you won't!

464
00:21:52,129 --> 00:21:56,616
Because I'll be at a local paper.
That's right, a local newspaper.

465
00:21:56,736 --> 00:21:59,065
<i>So my date, yes, date,
was a disaster.</i>

466
00:21:59,185 --> 00:22:03,523
<i>But at least my friends weren't
hiding in the toilet. Oh, they were.</i>

467
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,867
<i>There was only one person
for saving us now.</i>

468
00:22:07,987 --> 00:22:09,360
Thanks for stepping in, mate!

469
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,767
I was going to dive
when you put your cock away.

470
00:22:11,887 --> 00:22:14,960
- Budge up a minute Jay, I need a piss.
- You're not pissing in here, Neil.

471
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,560
- Why not? It's a toilet.
- Go outside if you have to.

472
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:20,160
What if they come in? I don't
see why I can't piss here.

473
00:22:20,534 --> 00:22:23,400
Because I do not want to see piss
coming out the end of your cock.

474
00:22:23,746 --> 00:22:25,800
- I could sit down and do it.
- What?

475
00:22:26,305 --> 00:22:28,120
I do that sometimes.
You know, for a treat.

476
00:22:29,238 --> 00:22:31,080
Oh, fuck, just get on with it then.

477
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:42,506
- Are you going yet?
- I can't, you're putting me off.

478
00:22:43,286 --> 00:22:44,880
- Shit, who's that?
- Northwood?

479
00:22:46,607 --> 00:22:48,810
- Who is it?
- It's obviously me.

480
00:22:52,686 --> 00:22:54,911
What is happening in here?

481
00:22:55,748 --> 00:22:57,920
- Has Charlotte sorted it?
- No. I've sorted it though.

482
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,360
- What have you done?
- My mum's gonna pick us up.

483
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,320
What?

484
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,920
- Oh, this is tragic.
- Called your mom!

485
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,403
Your mum is coming to rescue us
from the toilet of an under-18 disco

486
00:23:07,523 --> 00:23:09,440
because we're being bullied
by 12-year-olds?

487
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,560
No-one must ever know about this.

488
00:23:11,721 --> 00:23:16,040
Si, go outside and take your beating
from this child, and then we can leave.

489
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,400
I'd have taken him down if it
weren't for Northwood.

490
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:21,080
How were you going to take him down?
Spunk in his eyes?

491
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,800
Oh, shit. What if Carli finds
out about me and that girl?

492
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,920
Oh, no! Maybe she still
won't go out with you.

493
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:31,355
Oh, god this is a fucking disaster.
No actually, it's OK, it's fine.

494
00:23:31,475 --> 00:23:35,533
- I can move away and change schools.
- My night hasn't been brilliant either.

495
00:23:35,653 --> 00:23:38,520
At least next week will be better,
get my teeth into some journalism.

496
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,920
Oh, yeah, the paper want to keep me
on so there's no room for ya.

497
00:23:42,408 --> 00:23:43,800
Tell me you're joking?

498
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,680
They said I was the best
work experience they'd ever had.

499
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:51,027
<i>This is an urgent message
for William MacKenzie.</i>

500
00:23:51,147 --> 00:23:53,227
<i>Please make his way
to the front entrance</i>

501
00:23:53,347 --> 00:23:55,650
<i>as his mother is here to
pick him and his friends up.</i>

502
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:57,760
<i>This is an urgent message
for William MacKenzie.</i>

503
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:01,360
<i>Please come to the front where your
mother is waiting to collect you.</i>

504
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,920
Oh, for fuck's sake!

505
00:24:03,607 --> 00:24:06,805
<i>It had been a strange week. I hadn't
experienced much actual work,</i>

506
00:24:06,925 --> 00:24:09,120
<i>but I had learnt some valuable
lessons.</i>

507
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,080
<i>Never work with children or animals.</i>

508
00:24:12,081 --> 00:24:14,045
<i>Don't call your
valentine a porn star.</i>

509
00:24:14,165 --> 00:24:15,560
You're a nasty little virgin.

510
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,360
<i>And despite what I'd thought,</i>

511
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,960
<i>a girl touching your penis
is not always a good thing.</i>

512
00:24:20,305 --> 00:25:20,491
