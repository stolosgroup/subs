The Inbetweeners 2x04
"Night Out in London"

4
00:00:21,821 --> 00:00:24,230
<i>In case you're interested,
at my old school the day began</i>

5
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:27,350
<i>with prayers, followed by hymns
and then an inspirational reading.</i>

6
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:30,520
<i>Here it began with Jay,
showing me a pornographic video.</i>

7
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,782
Watch this.

8
00:00:33,711 --> 00:00:36,960
This is tame. They're not even naked.
Wait a minute, is she gonna...?

9
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,120
Oh, my God, that can't be real.

10
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,320
- It's chocolate?
- They should've got a bigger cup.

11
00:00:41,687 --> 00:00:44,360
- How tame is that, then?!
- Oh, Christ, I'm gonna heave.

12
00:00:44,942 --> 00:00:47,000
Jesus wept! Don't lick it!

13
00:00:47,386 --> 00:00:48,920
- She's gonna vomit.
- Me too.

14
00:00:49,138 --> 00:00:50,520
This is the best bit, look.

15
00:00:54,886 --> 00:00:58,000
- Is it possible to un-see things?
- I don't like girls anymore.

16
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,440
The first thing you did was find that
with your new laptop?

17
00:01:00,996 --> 00:01:04,120
No, it wasn't the first thing.
This was the first thing.

18
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,720
You lot are such saddos.

19
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,711
- Enough, we can't carry on like this!
- Carry on like what?

20
00:01:14,831 --> 00:01:18,760
We can't spend another term treading
water, being the same old sad cases.

21
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:22,600
- Well, I'm not a sad case.
- You just got called a sad case!

22
00:01:23,243 --> 00:01:25,520
- Look, we've got to do something.
- What do you mean?

23
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,600
Carpe diem!

24
00:01:27,024 --> 00:01:30,320
- Go fishing?
- Seize the day, be unexpected.

25
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:34,280
Reinvent ourselves, show the girls
and everyone else who we really are.

26
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,957
- Reinvent ourselves as what?
- I don't know!

27
00:01:37,401 --> 00:01:39,960
Literally anything! Something cool.

28
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,560
We could...
Start going clubbing in London.

29
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,120
- My dad wouldn't let me drive so far.
- That's the spirit!

30
00:01:45,544 --> 00:01:47,559
I could drive us.
I got a car last weekend.

31
00:01:47,679 --> 00:01:50,224
You've got a car?
You haven't even passed your test.

32
00:01:50,344 --> 00:01:52,581
- Yes, I have.
- You never thought to mention it?

33
00:01:52,701 --> 00:01:55,753
- You never asked.
- Of course, I forgot how it works.

34
00:01:55,873 --> 00:01:58,960
We have to ask you every single thing
that might have happened in case it did.

35
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,177
This is brilliant.
Now we don't have to drive around

36
00:02:01,297 --> 00:02:04,080
- in Simon's little bitch mobile.
- No more lifts for you.

37
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,720
What about that, Si?
If you don't have to drive, you come?

38
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,640
It's not the driving.
It's more that we won't get in anywhere,

39
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,600
won't get served
and might get robbed, stabbed or killed.

40
00:02:12,761 --> 00:02:13,600
Bullshit!

41
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,840
I go up to London all the time.

42
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,200
- When do you ever go to London?
- All the time!

43
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,478
I went last weekend,
I fucked some girl up there.

44
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:22,240
Did you? Where was that, then?

45
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,080
- It was in... The Tower of London.
- The Tower of London?

46
00:02:25,441 --> 00:02:27,719
What did you do after you'd fucked her,
cut her head off?

47
00:02:27,839 --> 00:02:30,977
- Showed her the crown jewels?
- She'd already seen the crown jewels

48
00:02:31,097 --> 00:02:32,560
- my bell-end.
- Brilliant.

49
00:02:33,021 --> 00:02:35,967
<i>Reinventing ourselves as clubbers
was a brilliant idea of mine.</i>

50
00:02:36,087 --> 00:02:39,616
<i>Obviously, we wouldn't get in anywhere,
but Simon could at least give it a go.</i>

51
00:02:39,736 --> 00:02:42,777
- Go on, Si, please come along.
- But it'll be expensive.

52
00:02:42,897 --> 00:02:45,000
Don't some of those clubs
charge 30 quid to get in?

53
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,451
I've already told you, I know the bloke
who runs all the doors.

54
00:02:47,571 --> 00:02:48,623
He'll slip us in.

55
00:02:48,743 --> 00:02:51,003
And when that turns out
to be bullshit, what then?

56
00:02:51,123 --> 00:02:52,440
- Hi, Simon!
- Carli!

57
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,070
How's your stomach?

58
00:02:55,464 --> 00:02:56,227
Fine.

59
00:02:56,347 --> 00:02:58,677
Simon had really bad
diarrhoea over the weekend.

60
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,175
Really bad.

61
00:03:00,564 --> 00:03:03,720
We're going up to London on Saturday,
clubbing. Do you want to come?

62
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,720
Sounds fun, we'd love to go.
Which club are you going to?

63
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,040
- Spearmint Rhino.
- Isn't that a strip club?

64
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,259
It's a mistake.
We're going to one of the big ones,

65
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:15,240
one of the big cool ones
in the downtown.

66
00:03:15,551 --> 00:03:16,600
Right, which one?

67
00:03:17,991 --> 00:03:20,600
- The Land of...
- The Sound of...

68
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,858
- We usually go to the Astoria.
- And that's exactly where we're going.

69
00:03:23,978 --> 00:03:25,846
- Cool.
- I'm driving if you want a lift.

70
00:03:25,966 --> 00:03:28,280
Nah, we'll probably head up early,
check out the shops.

71
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,800
- A lift back would be great, though.
- No problemo.

72
00:03:31,361 --> 00:03:33,600
- So, do you go clubbing a lot, then?
- Me?

73
00:03:34,049 --> 00:03:35,080
Yeah, you.

74
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,132
Yeah, yeah, course.
Dancing on the podium probably,

75
00:03:40,252 --> 00:03:42,880
or up by the speakers, where it's,
if anything, too loud!

76
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,857
- Great. See you there.
- See you.

77
00:03:44,977 --> 00:03:46,398
Great. See you later, then.

78
00:03:48,859 --> 00:03:52,000
What did I tell you?
London and muff go hand in hand.

79
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,320
Fucking hell,
I'm going on a date with Carli!

80
00:03:54,871 --> 00:03:56,640
- It's not really a date.
- I think it is.

81
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,803
- I reckon you're in there, too.
- Me?

82
00:03:59,296 --> 00:04:01,320
- Why do you think that?
- Cos she touched her hair!

83
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,920
In body language speak,
that means she wants you.

84
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,523
Well, Saturday night,

85
00:04:05,643 --> 00:04:08,000
there will be plenty of girls round me
touching their hair.

86
00:04:08,332 --> 00:04:10,280
- Their pubic hair, presumably?
- No,

87
00:04:10,495 --> 00:04:11,344
their...

88
00:04:11,716 --> 00:04:12,480
long...

89
00:04:13,946 --> 00:04:15,630
No, yeah, their pubic hair.

90
00:04:16,232 --> 00:04:17,405
<i>Saturday rolled around,</i>

91
00:04:17,525 --> 00:04:20,242
<i>and we were all incredibly excited
about our night out in London.</i>

92
00:04:20,555 --> 00:04:24,280
<i>Rachel, an actual girl with a working
face, had asked me if I was going,</i>

93
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:27,080
<i>Simon got to continue
his stalking of Carli,</i>

94
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,649
<i>Neil just liked being out
in the open, like a Labrador,</i>

95
00:04:29,951 --> 00:04:33,223
<i>and Jay was up for some make-believe
sex in a tourist attraction,</i>

96
00:04:33,343 --> 00:04:35,640
<i>maybe a hand-job at Madame Tussauds.</i>

97
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,760
<i>I had no idea
how we'd actually get into a club,</i>

98
00:04:38,214 --> 00:04:41,520
<i>but I wasn't taking any chances
and wore my smartest shoes,</i>

99
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,319
<i>something Simon didn't do.</i>

100
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,568
- Trainers, really?
- They look good.

101
00:04:45,688 --> 00:04:48,680
I specifically said no trainers,
not if we want to get into clubs.

102
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,055
- Everyone wears trainers.
- Jay hasn't got trainers on,

103
00:04:51,175 --> 00:04:52,602
I haven't got trainers on.

104
00:04:52,722 --> 00:04:55,133
You've got fucking flippers on!
What size are they?

105
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:57,059
Size eight, my size.

106
00:04:57,179 --> 00:04:59,818
Yeah, Ronald McDonald called,
he wants his shoes back.

107
00:04:59,938 --> 00:05:01,919
There's nothing wrong with these,
they're Italian.

108
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,800
Hey! Where are my-a flippers?

109
00:05:05,821 --> 00:05:08,320
- If you fall in the Thames, you're OK.
- Very funny!

110
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,840
Would it have killed you
to wear shoes to be on the safe side?

111
00:05:11,092 --> 00:05:12,280
Check out Neil's car!

112
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:14,627
Yeah! It's shit-hot!

113
00:05:14,747 --> 00:05:17,400
I'd say half-right. It's shit.

114
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,893
<i>But a rubbish red Nova wasn't
the main attraction at Neil's house.</i>

115
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,840
Hi, Katie!

116
00:05:25,101 --> 00:05:27,785
- He's upstairs.
- So how's things with you?

117
00:05:27,905 --> 00:05:29,918
Yeah! I feel like
I haven't seen you in ages.

118
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:33,280
Neil! Your friends want to know
if you're coming out to play.

119
00:05:33,728 --> 00:05:35,689
- Coming!
- Katie, do you like clubbing?

120
00:05:35,809 --> 00:05:38,000
Can you stop staring at my tits,
please?

121
00:05:40,827 --> 00:05:42,479
- She must be on the blob.
- All right?

122
00:05:43,346 --> 00:05:46,400
- What do you think of the car, then?
- It's like a tractor beam for fanny.

123
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,405
I love it!

124
00:05:47,525 --> 00:05:49,800
It's got a Piper exhaust
and a well smart body-kit.

125
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,240
My sister's boyfriend is helping me,
he's a mechanic.

126
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,400
Your dad must like
to have a man in the house.

127
00:05:55,132 --> 00:05:56,440
- What?
- It means,

128
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,200
- "Does your dad suck him off?"
- No!

129
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,800
- But your sister does.
- No!

130
00:06:01,055 --> 00:06:03,600
- Well, I mean, she might do.
- She definitely does.

131
00:06:04,924 --> 00:06:06,913
Nice, Porsche Engineering sticker.

132
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:10,397
I know. I put that on myself,
it's gotta be worth at least a hand-job.

133
00:06:10,517 --> 00:06:11,760
How fast does it go?

134
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,800
- Who knows? I ain't got it going yet.
- You've never drive it?

135
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,000
Nah, it don't work,
it ain't got an engine.

136
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,640
- Dave's still trying to find me one.
- You said you could drive us.

137
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,200
Yeah, so did I.

138
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,000
So how do you plan to drive us up there
without a car?

139
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,360
- I thought I could drive your car.
- But you're not insured with my car.

140
00:06:28,062 --> 00:06:30,195
- Yeah, I wondered about that.
- Oh, well,

141
00:06:30,315 --> 00:06:33,557
- Simon, you're gonna have to drive us.
- No! I said no,

142
00:06:33,677 --> 00:06:36,000
and my dad will go mental
if he knows that.

143
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,040
He won't find out.

144
00:06:38,441 --> 00:06:41,280
And even if he does, you'll have far
too many fingers up Carli to care.

145
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,600
Please?

146
00:06:45,927 --> 00:06:49,075
- Christ, thanks a lot, Neil!
- You need to be clearer about things.

147
00:06:49,195 --> 00:06:52,320
OK, is this clear enough?
You're a fucking idiot!

148
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,360
Calm down!
I'll get some beers for the trip.

149
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,190
- I can't drink and drive!
- Course you can, it's just a saying!

150
00:07:00,031 --> 00:07:03,078
<i>So Jay liberated a few of his
dad's lagers and we were off.</i>

151
00:07:03,198 --> 00:07:05,769
<i>The plan was simple:
get to London, get into a club, </i>

152
00:07:05,889 --> 00:07:08,371
<i>pull Carli and Rachel and then
return to school on Monday</i>

153
00:07:08,491 --> 00:07:10,480
<i>to find our credibility
at an all-time high.</i>

154
00:07:11,167 --> 00:07:13,022
<i>I said it was simple, not realistic.</i>

155
00:07:13,142 --> 00:07:15,520
<i>Meanwhile, we can enjoy
the enlightening conversation.</i>

156
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,993
Here, who would you rather fuck,
Will's mum or Neil's sister?

157
00:07:19,113 --> 00:07:20,688
- Good!
- Leave it out!

158
00:07:21,615 --> 00:07:23,360
- Will's mum.
- Don't join in, Neil!

159
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,569
Neil's sister would have
the tighter snatch.

160
00:07:25,689 --> 00:07:27,879
- Leave it out!
- But Will's mum has got huge tits.

161
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,680
- They are amazing.
- Thanks, Neil.

162
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,080
But Neil's sister seems
to be better at sucking dick.

163
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,783
- Like father like daughter.
- Yes,

164
00:07:33,903 --> 00:07:36,040
I could see her going at it
like a dog eating hot chips.

165
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:36,960
Shut up!

166
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,920
- I'd like to put my cock in them both.
- That's a touching sentiment.

167
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,240
- I'd touch your mum's sentiment.
- That means nothing.

168
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,480
It means I'd touch her bum-hole,
with my cock.

169
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,600
Nice one!

170
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,080
I've thought about it,
and I'd rather fuck Will's mum.

171
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:51,040
Are you sure?
What about your sister's tight snatch?

172
00:07:51,376 --> 00:07:54,040
- No, totally sure.
- Well, that's good, then.

173
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,669
Slow down a minute, Si.

174
00:07:58,836 --> 00:08:00,126
Bus wankers!

175
00:08:05,046 --> 00:08:07,714
Where did that come from?
Bus wankers!

176
00:08:07,834 --> 00:08:09,572
I dunno, it just felt right!

177
00:08:09,692 --> 00:08:11,971
You could see their little faces
drop as they thought,

178
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:14,120
"We must be the bus wankers."

179
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,400
- Pull over, Si. I need a piss.
- I can't pull over, there's a bus lane.

180
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,818
Please, I'm desperate.

181
00:08:18,938 --> 00:08:20,960
Just hold it, we're late enough.

182
00:08:23,741 --> 00:08:24,949
What are you doing?

183
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,240
- Are you pissing in my car?
- Nah.

184
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,360
- What's that noise, then?
- I'm pissing in a can.

185
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,600
What the fuck!
You'll get piss on the floor!

186
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,605
Don't worry, it won't overflow.
I've got me chap's-eye right in there,

187
00:08:34,725 --> 00:08:36,640
so I can't miss. No problemo.

188
00:08:36,979 --> 00:08:38,080
It stinks, Neil!

189
00:08:39,302 --> 00:08:41,200
- It don't wanna stop.
- What is the "it"?

190
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,320
- Just stop pissing yourself, Neil!
- Quick, pass me another can!

191
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,220
No way.

192
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,360
It's filled up to the top,
I've got to get it out!

193
00:08:48,161 --> 00:08:48,945
Shit!

194
00:08:49,324 --> 00:08:50,200
My helmet!

195
00:08:50,497 --> 00:08:53,040
I've cut it on the can!
I think it's bleeding!

196
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,040
Fuck bleeding! Is it still pissing?

197
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:58,028
- It stings!
- Does anybody want to swap seats?

198
00:08:58,148 --> 00:08:59,480
- I will!
- Not you!

199
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,640
Get rid of it!

200
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:08,178
<i>So high on the smell of Neil's urine, we
headed for the bright lights of London.</i>

201
00:09:11,036 --> 00:09:13,666
<i>Look out, ladies,
phase one was complete.</i>

202
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:15,669
<i>We had finally made it to London.</i>

203
00:09:20,321 --> 00:09:22,289
<i>And we even managed to
see all the sights...</i>

204
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:25,172
<i>Because Simon got us
totally fucking lost.</i>

205
00:09:29,453 --> 00:09:31,940
- It must be somewhere round here.
- I knew we'd get lost.

206
00:09:32,232 --> 00:09:34,780
- Thanks a lot, Neil.
- Is it my fault you're a shit driver?

207
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:38,260
- Carli will be mad if I'm late.
- You need to grow some balls, I reckon.

208
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:41,300
Why not pull over and ask someone
where the club full of clunge is?

209
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:43,060
I've got google maps on my phone!

210
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:45,380
Should be able to find it,
no problemo!

211
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,300
Neil, you have to stop...

212
00:09:47,807 --> 00:09:49,340
- No, Jay! Because...
- Go on.

213
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,779
Bus wankers!

214
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:56,931
- Why are you slowing down?
- I tried to say!

215
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:59,241
- Oh, Christ, Jay!
- Oh shit!

216
00:09:59,361 --> 00:10:01,380
No, they're coming! Shit! Drive!

217
00:10:01,662 --> 00:10:03,860
Where?!
Where am I meant to drive to?!

218
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,660
- Anywhere!
- Oh, shit!

219
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:14,661
Anywhere...

220
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:16,052
But the pavement.

221
00:10:20,945 --> 00:10:21,780
Listen...

222
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:24,077
Sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry, I...

223
00:10:24,197 --> 00:10:26,693
Who's a wanker?
I'm a wanker, am I? Yeah?

224
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:29,276
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry...
- Yeah? Yeah?

225
00:10:29,396 --> 00:10:31,660
- He said he was sorry.
- I'm a wanker, yeah?

226
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:32,940
I'm really sorry...

227
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,180
I'm sorry.

228
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,206
Sorry...

229
00:10:36,217 --> 00:10:39,140
I'd rather be a bus wanker than
drive that piece of yellow shit!

230
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,140
Fucking hell,
you two shit yourselves.

231
00:10:44,533 --> 00:10:45,260
What?!

232
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,780
"Sorry, sorry!"

233
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:50,060
- "I'm sorry, don't hurt me, sorry."
- You got me fucking throttled!

234
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,860
- "Sorry!"
- Fuck off!

235
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:55,660
- "Sorry I'm on the pavement."
- "Sorry, sorry for my little shit car."

236
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:58,340
"I'm sorry I'm alive and a bender!"

237
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,579
Just fuck off!

238
00:11:05,824 --> 00:11:06,764
Sorry, Si.

239
00:11:09,558 --> 00:11:12,239
- "Sorry I'm such a tit!"
- "Sorry, I've done a poo in my pants!"

240
00:11:12,359 --> 00:11:14,620
"Sorry my neck is stuck
in your hand."

241
00:11:14,915 --> 00:11:19,204
<i>Simon's a good friend, but it's
fair to say he drives like a retard.</i>

242
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:22,560
<i>But eventually, in Chinatown,
just a few hundred yards from the club,</i>

243
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,780
<i>we found the perfect parking space.</i>

244
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,660
<i>Well, almost perfect.</i>

245
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:29,663
- I don't think I can park here.
- We've been driving round for an hour

246
00:11:29,783 --> 00:11:32,340
looking for a space.
This one's perfect, let's just be cool!

247
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:36,020
- But it says we'll get clamped.
- It's a weekend, different rules.

248
00:11:36,406 --> 00:11:39,020
I'm sure he's right, Si,
and no-one clamps any more.

249
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:41,820
Please can we get going?
I really need to check my nob.

250
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:45,300
- I think I've got a big problemo.
- Can you stop saying problemo?

251
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:46,900
- What?
- It's not cool

252
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,860
or funny, it's just embarrassing.

253
00:11:49,522 --> 00:11:51,940
Don't worry, Neil,
he'll say sorry in a minute.

254
00:11:52,283 --> 00:11:54,620
- Maybe I should move it?
- Simon, listen to me.

255
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:57,955
Carli has agreed to go clubbing
with you, that's a big step forward,

256
00:11:58,075 --> 00:12:01,100
but during the time to find a space
she could have gone off the idea.

257
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,260
Yes, she could be wanking off
the DJ by now.

258
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:05,980
I doubt that's happening,
but the point is valid.

259
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,700
This is a great parking spot,
let's just get a move on.

260
00:12:09,151 --> 00:12:11,260
We are wasting valuable boning time.

261
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:15,540
Fine. Fine, come on, then.

262
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:17,900
Don't bother locking it, Si.

263
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:20,591
- If you're lucky, a guy might nick it!
- Yeah, good one...

264
00:12:21,077 --> 00:12:23,060
<i>So despite the odd throttling
and cut penis,</i>

265
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:26,626
<i>we made it to the club safely, and
the girls even seemed pleased to see us!</i>

266
00:12:27,992 --> 00:12:29,900
Hi Simon. I wondered where you were.

267
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,780
Did you? You're actually here.

268
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,820
- Yes.
- You weren't lying about coming, then?

269
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:36,375
- No. Why would I be lying?
- Don't know.

270
00:12:36,801 --> 00:12:38,180
Don't know why I said that.

271
00:12:39,044 --> 00:12:41,946
- Great, well we'll see you in there?
- Don't be a tit, just...

272
00:12:42,491 --> 00:12:43,533
Stand here!

273
00:12:43,653 --> 00:12:45,420
- Are you joining us?
- Yeah.

274
00:12:46,008 --> 00:12:47,401
Yeah, I think so.

275
00:12:48,155 --> 00:12:49,699
Are you fucking pushing in?

276
00:12:50,523 --> 00:12:52,180
Those arseholes pushed in!

277
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,731
So, great you're near the front.

278
00:12:57,827 --> 00:13:00,628
- Yeah, well, been here long enough.
- Suppose you have.

279
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:04,416
- I just wanna get inside and dance now.
- Yes, me too.

280
00:13:04,536 --> 00:13:06,860
There's something very animalistic
about our need to dance.

281
00:13:09,445 --> 00:13:12,180
- Those lads are throwing stuff at you.
- Don't think so.

282
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:14,820
They're frustrated cos they want
to get inside too. They're saying,

283
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:18,460
"Let us in, we've got bloody great
dancing ants in our pants!"

284
00:13:19,032 --> 00:13:21,180
Get to the back of the
queue, you four eyed prick!

285
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:24,460
It's OK if I stand with my back to you?
I don't want they think you're with me.

286
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:25,761
No, that's fine.

287
00:13:27,554 --> 00:13:30,100
<i>Rachel had the most beautiful
back of a head I'd ever seen.</i>

288
00:13:30,485 --> 00:13:32,427
<i>Now all we had to do
was get into the club.</i>

289
00:13:32,547 --> 00:13:34,220
- No trainers.
- What?!

290
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,540
No trainers.

291
00:13:35,863 --> 00:13:38,540
- But they're new.
- No trainers.

292
00:13:39,604 --> 00:13:41,240
I'll see you in there in a minute.

293
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:43,660
That's us fucked.

294
00:13:44,169 --> 00:13:46,296
I take it you don't know
that bouncer, then, Jay?

295
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:48,830
What's this got to do with me?
I'm not the one wearing trainers?

296
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:51,864
You fucking idiot!
I am totally in there...

297
00:13:51,984 --> 00:13:53,260
Like totally.

298
00:13:53,704 --> 00:13:56,820
- You couldn't just wear shoes?
- We could make a pair out of yours,

299
00:13:57,153 --> 00:14:00,300
- and keep leather left to cover a sofa.
- Doesn't matter anyway, I've sorted it.

300
00:14:00,712 --> 00:14:02,340
- I'm gonna borrow some shoes.
- What?

301
00:14:03,022 --> 00:14:04,192
Hammerhead shark!

302
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:05,557
No!

303
00:14:05,957 --> 00:14:09,700
Look, I'm gonna level with you.
I am scared. London scares me.

304
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:12,305
The bouncer scares me
and that man...

305
00:14:12,909 --> 00:14:15,340
Really scares me.
Let's just put this one down

306
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,260
as another character forming
experience and go home.

307
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:21,340
Come on, Will! It's for Carli!
She'll love it, it's romantic.

308
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,257
It's not quite Romeo and Juliet.

309
00:14:23,377 --> 00:14:25,142
These are tramp shoes
we're talking about.

310
00:14:25,262 --> 00:14:26,220
Scuse me?

311
00:14:26,923 --> 00:14:28,362
Mate? Scuse me?

312
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:30,220
Can I borrow your shoes?

313
00:14:31,147 --> 00:14:33,980
I wanna borrow your shoes,
I'm trying to impress a girl.

314
00:14:34,284 --> 00:14:36,020
- Giz a blow job.
- What?

315
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:38,137
- I'll give you a blow job.
- No.

316
00:14:38,257 --> 00:14:41,420
God, no, no blow jobs.
I just want your shoes.

317
00:14:42,211 --> 00:14:43,149
All right!

318
00:14:43,483 --> 00:14:45,025
- Â£20 quid!
- Great.

319
00:14:45,692 --> 00:14:46,871
And your shoes.

320
00:14:48,515 --> 00:14:49,462
Of course.

321
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:58,277
<i>Good old Simon. I can always rely on him
to add a touch of class to proceedings.</i>

322
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:01,061
<i>In many ways, though,
it proved how much he valued Carli.</i>

323
00:15:01,589 --> 00:15:03,500
<i>Certainly more than
he valued his dignity.</i>

324
00:15:04,162 --> 00:15:07,060
- They're a bit wet.
- That'll be my piss.

325
00:15:07,739 --> 00:15:08,421
OK.

326
00:15:08,897 --> 00:15:09,660
Thanks.

327
00:15:10,145 --> 00:15:11,818
<i>I'm not saying it was a dodgy club,</i>

328
00:15:11,938 --> 00:15:14,709
<i>but you have to question a door policy
which says no to trainers</i>

329
00:15:14,829 --> 00:15:17,540
<i>but a big thumbs up
to piss-soaked tramp shoes.</i>

330
00:15:19,613 --> 00:15:21,929
<i>But we were in! We had got in!</i>

331
00:15:22,049 --> 00:15:24,300
<i>Yes! In the club! An actual club!</i>

332
00:15:24,955 --> 00:15:25,727
<i>Yes!</i>

333
00:15:26,849 --> 00:15:28,420
I've died and gone to clunge heaven.

334
00:15:29,612 --> 00:15:30,487
Nice!

335
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,460
Well, this is what we wanted.

336
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:36,420
This is it, the first day
of the rest of our lives.

337
00:15:36,919 --> 00:15:40,100
It's one small step for a man,
one giant leap for your flippers.

338
00:15:41,035 --> 00:15:43,505
You won't be laughing
when we pull Carli and Rachel.

339
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:46,260
No I won't,
cos it ain't gonna happen.

340
00:15:46,602 --> 00:15:48,780
You can spend your evening
talking to little girls,

341
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:52,580
me and Neil are gonna find ourselves
some women with experienced snatches.

342
00:15:53,028 --> 00:15:54,412
Good luck.
Just one thing,

343
00:15:54,532 --> 00:15:56,420
I think the Tower of London
is closed now.

344
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:03,169
There she is. How do I look?

345
00:16:03,289 --> 00:16:05,356
You look good.
From the ankles up, obviously.

346
00:16:05,476 --> 00:16:07,060
Obviously. Where's Rachel?

347
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:10,340
Don't worry, she's keen, I'm sure
she'll find me. Away you go, mate.

348
00:16:10,962 --> 00:16:12,108
Wish me luck.

349
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:19,820
Simon, you got in!
I thought you were turned away.

350
00:16:20,495 --> 00:16:23,500
Will was being a dick with the bouncers
and there was a thing with my shoes.

351
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,420
They're out of ice.
Can you believe that?

352
00:16:26,199 --> 00:16:28,420
Simon, this is Adam.
He's a mate of Rachel's.

353
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:31,100
- All right!
- Yeah, you?

354
00:16:32,145 --> 00:16:34,091
Simon is an old friend
of the family.

355
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,980
Not just that, though.

356
00:16:36,896 --> 00:16:38,205
Can you smell piss?

357
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,740
Yes. That's totally rank.

358
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,573
Must be the toilets. We should move.

359
00:16:42,693 --> 00:16:43,929
Yeah, good idea.

360
00:16:44,049 --> 00:16:48,246
<i>Meanwhile, Jay and Neil headed to
discuss the nuances of sexual politics.</i>

361
00:16:48,366 --> 00:16:51,053
- She'd definitely get it!
- Most definitely.

362
00:16:55,265 --> 00:16:58,450
- Her? I think she looked over.
- Nice body, frightening face.

363
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:00,164
You'd have to do her from behind.

364
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:01,996
- What about her?
- Bit big,

365
00:17:02,116 --> 00:17:04,460
but then fat girls
are more grateful.

366
00:17:05,145 --> 00:17:07,179
Check out the jubblies on that!

367
00:17:07,642 --> 00:17:10,220
She'd get it. Until it fell off.

368
00:17:10,824 --> 00:17:12,272
- Please don't.
- Please do.

369
00:17:12,853 --> 00:17:15,749
No, she's given me a boner,
my cut's hurting worse than ever.

370
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:18,278
- I've gotta go and check it out.
- All right, but

371
00:17:18,398 --> 00:17:20,175
I might not be here
when you get back.

372
00:17:20,295 --> 00:17:23,412
That one's giving me the old,
"I'm gonna milk your balls dry" look.

373

-== [ www.OpenSubtitles.com ] ==-

374
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:40,768
<i>And in the toilets, Neil had
a very big problemo with his cock.</i>

375
00:17:51,188 --> 00:17:53,140
<i>I had my own difficulties
in the cock department.</i>

376
00:17:53,586 --> 00:17:54,984
<i>Rachel was sitting next to one.</i>

377
00:17:55,104 --> 00:17:57,780
Rachel!
There you are, found you!

378
00:17:58,175 --> 00:18:01,060
Ready to put on your dancing shoes?
I know I am!

379
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,020
Good!

380
00:18:03,933 --> 00:18:05,580
- Hi, I'm Will.
- Dean.

381
00:18:07,645 --> 00:18:08,318
So,

382
00:18:08,438 --> 00:18:10,620
- you come here often?
- You say that to all the girls?

383
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:17,448
He's got some chutzpah, that's fine.
Anyway, nice to meet you, but we're off.

384
00:18:18,545 --> 00:18:20,220
What?! I'm good here, thanks.

385
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:22,980
Come on. It's getting a bit
crowded round here, eh Dean?

386
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,260
Sorry, mate?

387
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:27,420
Come on, mate.
You've had a good run.

388
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:30,488
Believe me, if I was in your shoes and I
saw a gorgeous girl sitting on her own,

389
00:18:30,608 --> 00:18:32,900
I'd have made the move,
but I'm here now, so...

390
00:18:33,196 --> 00:18:36,500
- So what?
- So do the right thing and step aside,

391
00:18:36,829 --> 00:18:38,874
- because I was in with her first.
- No, you weren't.

392
00:18:38,994 --> 00:18:41,780
Is he for real? He talks like
he's from a black and white film.

393
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:45,020
- I was. I stood with you in the queue.
- Behind me.

394
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,820
Well, more beside you.

395
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:50,540
And you asked me if I was coming
along tonight. I've got witnesses.

396
00:18:51,053 --> 00:18:53,100
Will, I think you've got
the wrong end of the stick.

397
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:56,107
Evidently! So is that it?!
So shall I just...

398
00:18:56,227 --> 00:18:59,980
- Go away and leave you to it?
- Yes. Go away.

399
00:19:00,299 --> 00:19:01,020
Fine!

400
00:19:01,721 --> 00:19:04,060
Fine! That's the last you see of me.

401
00:19:04,432 --> 00:19:06,020
Thanks, Dean. Thanks a lot, mate.

402
00:19:07,909 --> 00:19:10,813
<i>I was starting to go off Rachel.
She wasn't really my type.</i>

403
00:19:10,933 --> 00:19:13,213
<i>Elsewhere,
my friends were faring no better.</i>

404
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:16,678
- I can still smell it.
- It's following us.

405
00:19:16,798 --> 00:19:19,380
Simon, I'm not being rude,
but I think that smell might be you.

406
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:23,540
- Right. These shoes do kick up a bit.
- Jesus, what the fuck is on your feet?

407
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:26,300
These aren't my shoes.
I had to borrow them to get in.

408
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:28,896
- Who brings spare shoes to a nightclub?
- No-one.

409
00:19:29,016 --> 00:19:31,340
- I swapped them with a guy outside.
- He was a tramp?

410
00:19:32,096 --> 00:19:33,940
I think you're supposed
to say homeless now.

411
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,420
Sorry,
you're wearing a tramp's shoes?

412
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:39,818
- Mate, that is weird.
- Yeah.

413
00:19:41,339 --> 00:19:42,100
Maybe.

414
00:19:45,366 --> 00:19:48,498
- What's taking so fucking long?
- Mate, it's not good.

415
00:19:48,618 --> 00:19:52,407
- Get us bog roll, it's bleeding, look.
- Jesus, put it away, Neil.

416
00:19:52,527 --> 00:19:54,489
I can't. It stings
when it rubs on my pants.

417
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:57,980
- Take your pants off then.
- Then it'll rub on my jeans.

418
00:19:58,884 --> 00:20:02,340
No matter what your old man says,
you can't walk round London naked.

419
00:20:04,946 --> 00:20:07,780
What?! I didn't do nothing.
I wasn't doing anything.

420
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:14,657
So she didn't see the romantic intention
behind the tramp shoes?

421
00:20:14,777 --> 00:20:18,000
Not right now, but if that prick hadn't
been there it would've been different.

422
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,000
To be fair, the smell is appalling.

423
00:20:20,437 --> 00:20:22,303
- What happened with Rachel?
- The usual.

424
00:20:22,423 --> 00:20:25,440
It was going well, then she realised
I'm a dickhead and she pulled other guy.

425
00:20:25,831 --> 00:20:26,633
Right.

426
00:20:29,497 --> 00:20:31,592
- It's shit here, isn't it?
- Yeah. Shall we go?

427
00:20:31,712 --> 00:20:33,320
- Yeah.
- No, wait!

428
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,880
I wasn't wanking.

429
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:38,920
- Great.
- My cock's cut. My cock is cut!

430
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,800
<i>So we were chucked out,
out the club.</i>

431
00:20:41,253 --> 00:20:45,264
<i>The actual club chucked us out,
exactly 25 minutes after it started,</i>

432
00:20:45,384 --> 00:20:47,408
<i>our life as cool London clubbers
was over.</i>

433
00:20:47,528 --> 00:20:48,600
So, what happened?

434
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:51,160
I don't know. I was just looking
at the cut on my cock.

435
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,480
- Jay was helping me out.
- Sorry.

436
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,880
- Jay was helping you out?
- It's not like it sounds.

437
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:59,000
Cos it sounds like you were
watching Neil wank in the toilets.

438
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,680
I wasn't wanking,
I was just rolling it round in my hands.

439
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,920
All right, spare us the details.

440
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,600
Oh, fuck. What if Carli's
getting off with that bloke?

441
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,402
Don't cry, Si. At least you
can get your trainers back.

442
00:21:09,522 --> 00:21:10,260
What?

443
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,552
Fucking beauty.
I'll have that, you bastard.

444
00:21:13,985 --> 00:21:14,800
Brilliant.

445
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,960
- How have you done that?
- What?

446
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,160
- You've had them an hour.
- Maybe he's been out?

447
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,680
- Technically, he's always out.
- Right. Let's go. I've had enough.

448
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,674
Be sober in an alleyway
stinking of piss

449
00:21:25,794 --> 00:21:28,400
and wearing a tramp's shoes was not
what I had planned for this evening.

450
00:21:29,703 --> 00:21:32,109
Out of interest, you think it would go
better or worse than this?

451
00:21:32,229 --> 00:21:33,557
<i>So the night was over,</i>

452
00:21:33,677 --> 00:21:37,048
<i>and all we wanted to do now was get
back in Simon's shit car and go home.</i>

453
00:21:38,073 --> 00:21:38,800
Fuck.

454
00:21:40,372 --> 00:21:42,480
Fuckety, fuck, fucko.

455
00:21:43,428 --> 00:21:44,194
Shit.

456
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,880
- How much money have we got between us?
- No, you chose to park here.

457
00:21:48,345 --> 00:21:49,655
Fucking hell, Jay.

458
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,200
Sorry. I don't have any money left.
Getting in cleaned me out.

459
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,105
- I think you'll have to call your Dad.
- It's one in the morning.

460
00:21:56,225 --> 00:21:57,920
He's going to go fucking mental.

461
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,080
- I told him I was staying at Neil's.
- Unlock it, Si. I'm freezing.

462
00:22:01,749 --> 00:22:04,200
He loves you. He'd rather come
and get you than see you suffer.

463
00:22:12,629 --> 00:22:13,760
Dad, it's Simon.

464
00:22:16,995 --> 00:22:19,840
Don't panic, nothing's wrong.
Just calm down.

465
00:22:20,207 --> 00:22:22,760
No, I'm not dead. If I'm dead,
how could I be talking to you?

466
00:22:24,298 --> 00:22:25,920
You owe me Â£200.

467
00:22:26,573 --> 00:22:29,120
- I'll call you back.
- Sir, as I am sure you're aware,

468
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,720
private clamping is illegal.
And it is a weekend...

469
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,880
I couldn't get my fucking van out.

470
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:36,400
- I've just called my Dad and he'll...
- I couldn't give a fuck.

471
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,760
Â£200... now!

472
00:22:38,474 --> 00:22:40,622
- I don't have it!
- We don't have it!

473
00:22:41,552 --> 00:22:44,360
I want Â£200!

474
00:22:45,236 --> 00:22:48,040
Can't you fucking read?
No fucking parking!

475
00:22:48,459 --> 00:22:50,497
I missed all my fucking deliveries.

476
00:22:51,112 --> 00:22:53,738
Give me my fucking money now.
I'm gonna fucking kill you

477
00:22:53,858 --> 00:22:56,760
- unless you give me my fucking money?
- Do you still want that lift?

478
00:22:58,185 --> 00:22:59,480
No. I'm fine, thanks.

479
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,760
Great.
See you Monday.

480
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,080
200 livres!

481
00:23:05,988 --> 00:23:09,360
I'm gonna fucking kill you unless
you give me my fucking money.

482
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,840
<i>So we had successfully
reinvented ourselves,</i>

483
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,091
<i>but not as the boys
who go clubbing. No.</i>

484
00:23:14,211 --> 00:23:16,040
<i>We were now the boys
who freaked out girls...</i>

485
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,640
<i>Can you stop staring at my tits?</i>

486
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,440
<i>- ... apologised a lot...
- Sorry, I'm really sorry.</i>

487
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,610
<i>... wore tramp's shoes
and wanked in public toilets.</i>

488
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:24,960
<i>My cock is cut!</i>

489
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,837
- I think you've got a big problemo.
- Please just shut up, Neil.

490
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,568
Maybe you should try
saying sorry over and over.

491
00:23:30,688 --> 00:23:34,160
- "Sorry for parking like a nob."
- Just fuck off!

492
00:23:35,305 --> 00:24:35,851
