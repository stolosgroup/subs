00:00:21,604 --> 00:00:25,046
<i>'Hi, I'm Will, and yes it's a briefcase.</i>

4
00:00:25,171 --> 00:00:27,736
<i>'I'm still at a normal,
terrifying comprehensive,</i>

5
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:31,406
<i>'cos Mum hasn't enough money to
send me back to my old, private</i>

6
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:33,372
<i>'and let's face it better school.</i>

7
00:00:33,497 --> 00:00:36,073
<i>'But I've made friends
and, in some ways,</i>

8
00:00:36,198 --> 00:00:38,392
<i>'this term will be better than the last.</i>

9
00:00:38,685 --> 00:00:41,513
<i>'And in many other
ways, a lot, lot worse.</i>

10
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,932
<i>'But before all that, my first
hurdle of the new term involved</i>

11
00:00:45,057 --> 00:00:49,072
<i>'a freezing cold day in January, a
coach and Jay calling me a bender.</i>

12
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,770
- Morning, benders.
- All right.

13
00:00:50,895 --> 00:00:54,312
This is it. The Swanage field
trip is legendary for carnage.

14
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,152
It's the only reason I chose geography.

15
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,915
Seems a flimsy reason
- unspecified carnage.

16
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,951
I'll tell you one thing
that won't be flimsy.

17
00:01:01,076 --> 00:01:03,837
My cock. There's this
sexy housewife down there,

18
00:01:03,962 --> 00:01:06,311
and every year she fucks
one bloke from our school.

19
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,580
- How could you possibly know that?
- My mate went last year and banged her.

20
00:01:09,705 --> 00:01:11,670
He said she was the best he'd ever had.

21
00:01:11,795 --> 00:01:15,272
A right fit, mature bird that does
it because she loves young meat.

22
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,792
Bollocks! For one thing, you
don't even have a mate in year 13.

23
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,173
- Yeah, I do, Chris Groves.
- Never heard of him.

24
00:01:21,298 --> 00:01:23,512
He's not gonna hang out
with a twat like you.

25
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,189
Let me get this straight. Your
imaginary friend fucked an imaginary

26
00:01:26,314 --> 00:01:30,312
older woman in Swanage, so you decided
to do geography A level. Good plan.

27
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,472
We should have a laugh,
do something different.

28
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,752
We could go on a boat trip! I checked
online, they hireboats from the harbour.

29
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,505
The internet is wasted on you.

30
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:40,267
No, I dunno, we should try to
get off with the local girls,

31
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:42,072
or get some booze in or something.

32
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,552
What we're shit at here, but
by the seaside. Can't wait.

33
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,752
We could let fireworks off in our room.

34
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,315
Could do. Might be a bit pointless.

35
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,912
- Neil, what are you doing?
- Getting on the coach.

36
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,832
- You don't do geography or sociology.
- I know that.

37
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,232
So what are you doing getting
on the coach to the field trip?

38
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,632
Jay was going on about
how mental it all was,

39
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,912
and I wanted to go, so I asked Mr
Kennedy if I could come and help out.

40
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,432
Paedo Kennedy? He said yes, presumably?

41
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,512
- He did actually.
- Who's Paedo Kennedy?

42
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,259
Geography teacher and paedo.

43
00:02:10,384 --> 00:02:12,792
I don't believe the school
would employ a paedophile.

44
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,463
- They have done.
- The thing is, they haven't, have they?

45
00:02:15,588 --> 00:02:18,352
He was caught wanking
over the school orchestra.

46
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,032
- When?
- Before we started.

47
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,988
Convenient. What's he asked you to do?

48
00:02:22,113 --> 00:02:23,712
He's got to collect a load of samples.

49
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,071
- What, of your spunk?
- Collected in his mouth. And hair.

50
00:02:27,196 --> 00:02:28,067
Behave.

51
00:02:28,353 --> 00:02:31,312
<i>'So although Neil was now a
suspected paedo's plaything,</i>

52
00:02:31,437 --> 00:02:33,632
<i>'we boarded the coach with high hopes.</i>

53
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,830
<i>'It might have been a
new term and a new year,</i>

54
00:02:35,955 --> 00:02:37,944
<i>'but some things never change.'</i>

55
00:02:38,069 --> 00:02:39,738
Still going well with Carli, then.

56
00:02:39,863 --> 00:02:41,332
- Shut up.
- Here he is.

57
00:02:41,574 --> 00:02:43,047
Oh, watch out, Neil!

58
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,552
Oh, don't do that.

59
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,832
Thumbs up, friend!

60
00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:49,450
Weird, old, inappropriate friend!

61
00:02:49,857 --> 00:02:52,612
- Spunk samples friend!
- Why did he have to do the thumbs up?

62
00:02:52,737 --> 00:02:55,910
That's what'll go up your arse.
It's going up your arse first...

63
00:02:56,035 --> 00:02:59,432
<i>'But in all the excitement, we'd
forgotten the first rule of coach travel</i>

64
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,887
<i>- 'Hard kids at the back.'</i>
- I'm off.

65
00:03:02,012 --> 00:03:05,432
No, Stay! There's no reason for
us to move, and we're not moving!

66
00:03:06,101 --> 00:03:06,912
Move.

67
00:03:07,184 --> 00:03:09,810
- Why should we move?
- D'you want me to give you a reason?

68
00:03:10,287 --> 00:03:11,907
Well, I'm not leaving without one.

69
00:03:12,032 --> 00:03:14,506
- I don't think you understand.
- I don't think that you understand

70
00:03:14,631 --> 00:03:17,105
that we got up early to
secure these seats and...

71
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,500
Fine, good point.

72
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:21,112
Fuck, where we gonna sit now?

73
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:23,712
What is going on? Will you lot sit down.

74
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,032
Our seats have been taken.
There's nowhere left.

75
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,672
There's loads at the
front. Sit next to John.

76
00:03:28,797 --> 00:03:31,331
I'm not sitting next to John,
his fat arse takes up two seats.

77
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:34,392
- I have feelings too, you know.
- Fine, you're sitting next to me.

78
00:03:34,649 --> 00:03:37,075
- Oh, what?!
- Well, it's me or Mr Kennedy.

79
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,553
Now, come on, hurry up!

80
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,941
And McKenzie, sit down.

81
00:03:47,698 --> 00:03:48,792
- Hello.
- Hi.

82
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,632
Um, who are you?

83
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,472
I'm Lauren Harris. I'm new.

84
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,792
Hi, I'm Will McKenzie.
Scary being new, isn't it?

85
00:03:56,127 --> 00:03:56,985
It's a bit.

86
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:59,038
The way the kids threaten to beat you up

87
00:03:59,163 --> 00:04:01,638
and call you names
like, "briefcase wanker!"

88
00:04:01,923 --> 00:04:04,632
- Oh, it's not been like that.
- No, it wasn't for me either.

89
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:10,112
<i>'I was more used to field trips to

94
00:04:21,599 --> 00:04:24,084
Don't even think about
trying to talk to me.

95
00:04:31,455 --> 00:04:34,032
- Oi, who wants to swap seats?
- Nah, you're all right.

96
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,362
Oh, God, it's so boring up there.

97
00:04:37,452 --> 00:04:39,872
Wait a minute, who's Spongebob
shit-his-pants talking to?

98
00:04:41,037 --> 00:04:42,432
She's fit!

99
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,752
Yeah, she is.

100
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,312
- This'll get her attention.
- Neil, don't be embarrassing.

101
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,013
Oi, everyone, watch this.

102
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,232
- What's going on?
- Neil's being silly.

103
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,592
Is he doing that horn
thing? That's funny.

104
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,112
Yeah, no, really funny silly,
isn't it? Silly in a funny way.

105
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,644
- Do it again, Neil.
- Yeah, do it again, Neil.

that, I got a good one.

Cartwright. Sit down.

this nympho hangs out?

114
00:05:42,568 --> 00:05:44,192
Not sure. High Street, maybe?

115
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,408
Or by the ice-cream stall on the front?

116
00:05:46,657 --> 00:05:49,960
Apparently, she comes up to you and
asks for a lick of your Cornetto.

117
00:05:50,085 --> 00:05:52,552
It means she's offering
a cock-in-mouth situation.

118
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,309
- It's like a code.
- Brilliant.

119

Will, bit embarrassing, but do you
mind if I sit with you at lunch?

120
00:05:58,138 --> 00:05:59,792
You know, cos I've got no mates.

121
00:05:59,961 --> 00:06:03,472
- God! No problem at all.
- You can sit on my lap if you like.

122
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,700
No, thank you. You should know,
that thing you did on the bus

123
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:09,185
was really sad and
pathetic and not funny.

124
00:06:10,057 --> 00:06:11,292
I'll see you later.

125
00:06:13,197 --> 00:06:14,167
Frigid.

126
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,801
You won't be getting
off with Lauren, then.

127
00:06:17,926 --> 00:06:20,745
Who cares? She's just a little girl.
I didn't come down here for girls,

128
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:23,872
I get enough of them back home.
Nah, I come here for a woman.

129
00:06:24,225 --> 00:06:26,392
- She is fit, though.
- What?

130
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,832
- Lauren's fit, isn't she?
- I saw her first.

131
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,768
What? I only said she was fit.

132
00:06:30,893 --> 00:06:32,098
- Hi, guys.
- Hi!

133
00:06:32,223 --> 00:06:34,952
- Here, sit down here.
- I'm just off actually.

134
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,636
Don't leave on my account.

135
00:06:36,761 --> 00:06:39,204
It's not that, it's just I've
got to see a man about a dog,

136
00:06:39,329 --> 00:06:40,719
then a woman about a pussy.

137
00:06:41,502 --> 00:06:42,997
I do know what that means.

138
00:06:44,227 --> 00:06:46,415
- Right. You coming, Neil?
- Yeah.

139
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:49,992
- I'm Simon, by the way.
- Hi, Simon.

140
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,377
Sorry about those two.

141
00:06:51,502 --> 00:06:53,879
It's all right, I've a younger
brother, so I'm used to it.

142
00:06:54,004 --> 00:06:57,032
Actually, he's eight, so he's a
bit more mature, but you know...

143
00:06:58,527 --> 00:07:00,184
Feisty one, you are!

144
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,632
- What?
- Feisty one, you are!

145
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,337
Why are you talking like that?

146
00:07:05,965 --> 00:07:06,912
It was Yoda.

147
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:10,014
From Star Wars.

148
00:07:10,794 --> 00:07:13,339
It's the same impression I was
doing on the coach for about an hour.

149
00:07:13,464 --> 00:07:15,189
Is that what that was? Oh, good.

150
00:07:15,314 --> 00:07:17,512
I thought you might,
you know, have a problem.

151
00:07:17,862 --> 00:07:19,672
- No.
- Or Asperger's, maybe?

152
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,732
Wrong again!

153
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:23,222
-Have you ever been tested for anything?
- Good one.

154
00:07:24,205 --> 00:07:26,912
I was going to ask, would one
of you do the survey with me,

155
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,349
- cos I've got no mates and all that?
- I will.

156
00:07:29,474 --> 00:07:30,630
- Really?
- Yep.

157
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:33,192
I don't think you can, actually.

158
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,912
- Why not?
- Yeah, why not?

159
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,012
Maybe because of what
I mentioned earlier?

160
00:07:37,137 --> 00:07:40,192
- Jay fucking an old woman?
- Ladies present. No, the other thing.

161
00:07:41,524 --> 00:07:43,387
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

162
00:07:43,512 --> 00:07:45,232
She doesn't know
anyone, don't be a dick.

163
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,195
I'm not being a dick, Simon,

164
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,152
I'm just saying who am I
going to do my survey with?

165
00:07:52,746 --> 00:07:53,749
Oh, no.

166
00:07:53,874 --> 00:07:56,982
Mr Gilbert says I'm to pair up
with you because I'm not very good

167
00:07:57,107 --> 00:07:59,330
with directions and I might get lost.

168
00:08:01,067 --> 00:08:01,850
Great!

169
00:08:02,503 --> 00:08:05,042
Can I borrow your forms?
I spilt ketchup on mine.

170
00:08:05,167 --> 00:08:07,312
<i>'So Simon got to hang
out with lovely Lauren,</i>

171
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,872
<i>'while I had to stop a fat kid
from wandering into the sea.</i>

172
00:08:10,729 --> 00:08:14,232
<i>'Jay was searching for that rarest of
beasts - a sexy, middle-aged woman.'</i>

173
00:08:14,357 --> 00:08:17,173
Hurry up, Jay, I've got to get back
to help Kennedy out in 15 minutes.

174
00:08:17,298 --> 00:08:18,653
All right, I'll try this one.

175
00:08:19,064 --> 00:08:20,560
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

176
00:08:21,117 --> 00:08:23,832
We're doing a survey for school,
can I ask you a few questions?

177
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,192
- Will it take long?
- It can take as long as you like.

178
00:08:26,734 --> 00:08:27,647
Sorry?

179
00:08:27,772 --> 00:08:29,554
Nah. First question,

180
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:32,560
what form of transport did
you take into town today?

181
00:08:32,911 --> 00:08:33,865
I drove.

182
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,991
And how often do you
use public transport?

183
00:08:38,653 --> 00:08:39,512
Um, rarely.

184
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:45,046
And do you wear, like,
stockings and that?

185
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,435
Is this about transport?

186
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,152
It's just the questions
written down. One last one.

187
00:08:54,135 --> 00:08:54,969
All right.

188
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,293
Oh, hello. Where's Lauren?

189
00:08:57,418 --> 00:08:59,832
She went to get a drink. She's nice.

190
00:09:00,379 --> 00:09:02,377
I thought you were interested in Carli?

191
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:06,552
Well, sort of, but Lauren's all
right, you know? Easy to talk to.

192
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:08,509
Did she mention me at all?

193
00:09:08,634 --> 00:09:09,609
- No.
- Right.

194
00:09:09,734 --> 00:09:11,521
She thought I was really good-looking.

195
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,720
I was not expecting that.

196
00:09:15,551 --> 00:09:19,192
This is a bit weird cos I really like
her, but I think she might like you.

197
00:09:19,834 --> 00:09:22,512
If you think she fancies me
then I should probably go for it.

198
00:09:22,637 --> 00:09:24,780
Perhaps, except I'm
saying that I like her.

199
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:27,152
I should go for it, though.

200
00:09:27,616 --> 00:09:29,512
Any thoughts on the
"me liking her" part?

201
00:09:30,286 --> 00:09:34,672
Um, no, sure, good point. But she
is fit, so you can see my problem.

202
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,791
- Not really.
- But you know how it is.

203
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:38,672
How? How is it?

204
00:09:39,757 --> 00:09:40,672
You know.

205
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:45,192
Wait and just see what happens later.
Maybe she's not interested with us.

206
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,280
I suppose that's true,
let's wait and see.

207
00:09:47,566 --> 00:09:50,152
- No hard feelings if she goes for me?
- Oh, I'm not worried about that.

208
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:57,819
All right? Found that nympho yet?

209
00:09:57,944 --> 00:09:59,552
- Not yet.
- Surprisingly.

210
00:09:59,877 --> 00:10:02,512
- Where have you been, Neil?
- Me and Kennedy went swimming.

211
00:10:02,888 --> 00:10:04,344
- Sorry?
- Swimming?

212
00:10:04,469 --> 00:10:06,076
- Yeah.
- Just the two of you?

213
00:10:06,201 --> 00:10:07,992
Paedo Kennedy took you skinny-dipping?

214
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,912
No. He gave me a spare pair of trunks.

215
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,927
- What, Speedos?
- They were, actually.

216
00:10:12,394 --> 00:10:14,592
I'm beginning to see what he
gets out of this arrangement,

217
00:10:14,717 --> 00:10:18,176
- but what's in it for you?
- This. He got me it from the offy.

218
00:10:18,301 --> 00:10:19,274
- Nice!
- Cool.

219
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:21,774
- Shit!
- Now here comes some carnage.

220
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:23,179
He said don't tell Gilbert.

221
00:10:23,304 --> 00:10:26,232
About the swimming or the planned
sexual assault when you're drunk?

222
00:10:26,869 --> 00:10:28,595
- Both.
- This is brilliant!

223
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,072
We can all get well pissed.

224
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,414
It does mean that we're
now pimping Neil out.

225
00:10:32,539 --> 00:10:34,261
- I'm cool with that.
- Me too.

226
00:10:36,263 --> 00:10:37,648
- Shit!
- Hide it!

227
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:40,592
Simon. It's Lauren.
Are you guys in there?

228
00:10:44,344 --> 00:10:45,152
All right?

229
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,621
Hey. There's a load
of noise down the hall.

230
00:10:47,746 --> 00:10:49,147
Sounds like a party. Fancy it?

231
00:10:49,272 --> 00:10:52,158
Party, hmmmmm?! Cool, that sounds!

232
00:10:53,594 --> 00:10:55,512
You know, you are never,
ever going to get laid.

233
00:10:56,422 --> 00:10:57,418
<i>'Jay was wrong.</i>

234
00:10:57,543 --> 00:11:00,690
<i>'Statistically, there was a good
chance I would get laid, eventually.'</i>

235
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,165
<i>'So, we had the booze
and the girls, well,</i>

236
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:06,682
<i>'a girl, now all we needed to get
this party started was a party.'</i>

237
00:11:09,141 --> 00:11:09,954
What?

238
00:11:10,971 --> 00:11:13,402
- We're here for the party.
- It's that posh little prick.

239
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:15,740
Ask him if he's got
any pictures of his mum.

240
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:18,362
He's got a bottle of vodka.

241
00:11:20,131 --> 00:11:21,682
Here they are, team twat.

242
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:26,025
- What have you brought me?
- Well, it's Neil's vodka.

243
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:27,842
We thought we could join the party...

244
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:29,747
Thank you, wankers.

245
00:11:31,964 --> 00:11:33,138
That went well!

246
00:11:33,749 --> 00:11:35,722
So I reckon the party's
probably over for us then?

247
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:37,667
We could do something else. Pool?

248
00:11:38,136 --> 00:11:41,676
Table tennis? I think I saw
the board game Risk downstairs.

249
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:44,306
Fuck that for a laugh. I'm
going to find that yummy mummy

250
00:11:44,431 --> 00:11:47,820
- who wants me to spunk on her
tummy. - A rape-y rhyme. How lovely.

251
00:11:47,945 --> 00:11:49,383
Come on let's bunk it.

252
00:11:50,324 --> 00:11:53,642
I think I'll call it a night, guys.
Maybe see you at breakfast?

253
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:55,561
Do you wanna walk me back to my dorm?

254
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:58,402
- My pleasure.
- Oh, I meant Simon.

255
00:11:58,995 --> 00:12:00,002
Er, yeah, OK.

256
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:02,898
Great, we'll both walk you back then.

257
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:13,402
- See you tomorrow, Will.
- Definitely. See tomorrow.

258
00:12:13,792 --> 00:12:15,842
Simon, can I speak to
you before you head back?

259
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:17,211
Yeah, course.

260
00:12:18,735 --> 00:12:19,801
Good night, Will.

261
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:24,083
It's OK, I'll wait for Si.

262
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:26,256
You can say anything
you want in front of me.

263
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:30,419
Simon, do you fancy hanging out tomorrow

264
00:12:30,544 --> 00:12:32,642
maybe, in the free
time. Just the two of us?

265
00:12:33,383 --> 00:12:35,722
- Bit rude.
- I'd love to do that.

266
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:38,722
- Cool. Meet by the harbour after lunch?
- By the sea?

267
00:12:39,243 --> 00:12:41,962
That's where they position them
- easier for the boats.

268
00:12:42,394 --> 00:12:44,282
- Good night then, Will.
- Yeah, whatever.

269
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:46,884
- Good night, Simon.
- Yeah, good night.

270
00:12:55,456 --> 00:12:58,069
Come on then, Si, let's get going.

271
00:12:59,193 --> 00:13:03,388
- It's been so nice meeting you, Simon.
- I know. I mean, I feel the same.

272
00:13:05,233 --> 00:13:07,599
Getting late, Si, off we go.

273
00:13:11,766 --> 00:13:12,481
Si.

274
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,186
Come on now, mate.

275
00:13:18,502 --> 00:13:19,402
Right,

276
00:13:20,043 --> 00:13:21,770
I'll see you back at the dorm, then.

277
00:13:21,895 --> 00:13:23,860
I'll leave a knife right by my bed, just

278
00:13:23,985 --> 00:13:27,434
pop it in my back later, mate.
Right between the shoulder blades.

279
00:13:28,329 --> 00:13:29,452
Night then, Lauren.

280
00:13:29,577 --> 00:13:32,797
<i>'So Simon got a hug. A hug, not sex.</i>

281

<i>'But the way he went on about it,
you'd think she'd sucked his foreskin.'</i>

282
00:13:36,251 --> 00:13:38,264
Can you believe it? I
think she really likes me.

283
00:13:38,389 --> 00:13:40,579
Yeah, I think it's time
to get some sleep now.

284
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:43,654
- Funny that she...
- Hello.

285
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:47,451
It's only me, boys.
Just on my way to bed,

286
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:50,791
thought I'd check how you are.

287
00:13:52,885 --> 00:13:55,957
Swimming's tiring, are your legs tired?

288
00:13:58,613 --> 00:14:00,202
- I think they're OK.
- Yes.

289
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:02,777
Quick massage before bedtime?

290
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:05,484
Tired legs.

291
00:14:08,925 --> 00:14:09,922
Come on, John.

292
00:14:11,438 --> 00:14:13,814
Rub down, shift the lactic acid.

293
00:14:13,939 --> 00:14:15,022
Not now, John.

294
00:14:23,661 --> 00:14:26,442
- Was that a dream ordid that happen?
- That was your wet dream.

295
00:14:26,874 --> 00:14:29,402
- No. It wasn't.
- He rubbed my legs.

296
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:31,802
That's what you get
for leading on paedos.

297
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:33,442
Shouldn't we report him?

298
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:36,570
- He did give us that vodka.
- That's called "grooming,".

299
00:14:36,695 --> 00:14:37,882
- Is it?
- Yes.

300
00:14:39,341 --> 00:14:40,221

00:14:46,607 --> 00:14:48,858
- Yes. Of course.
- She's pretty cool. Is she?

305
00:14:48,983 --> 00:14:52,458
Is she. Fuck off you
beady eyed little shits!

306
00:14:53,939 --> 00:14:56,452
- Are you sure you're all right with it?
- Hi, Simon.

307
00:14:56,577 --> 00:14:59,085
- Hello.
- Haven't seen you, where've you been?

308
00:15:00,098 --> 00:15:01,202
Just here.

309
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:03,842
- What are you doing this afternoon?
- Nothing.

310
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:05,282
- Sure?
- Yes.

311
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:07,813
I'm sure you've got something on.

312
00:15:07,938 --> 00:15:09,039
No, I don't think so.

313
00:15:09,164 --> 00:15:12,035
As we haven't hung
out in ages I thought,

314
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,862
like, why don't I see
what Simon's doing?

315
00:15:13,987 --> 00:15:15,030
- Did you?
- Yeah.

316
00:15:15,155 --> 00:15:18,150
That's a real shame, Carli,
cos Simon's hanging out with,

317
00:15:18,275 --> 00:15:19,842
is it Lauren, this afternoon.

318
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:23,802
Oh, right, is that the new
girl? I saw you talking to her.

319
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,322
- Did you?
- Yeah.

320
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:27,290
Simon can't come cos he's got a date.

321
00:15:27,415 --> 00:15:29,153
Are you going on a date with her?

322
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:31,402
No, not a date. Just hanging.

323
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:33,183
I didn't realise it was a date thing.

324
00:15:33,308 --> 00:15:35,620
No, listen to me, it's not a date.

325
00:15:35,745 --> 00:15:38,026
It can't be a date
because anyone's welcome.

326
00:15:38,151 --> 00:15:41,559
Me, you, Lauren, who
may or may not be coming.

327
00:15:41,684 --> 00:15:45,007
- She is coming.
- I don't care either way if she does.

328
00:15:45,132 --> 00:15:47,176
It would be great to hang out with you.

329
00:15:47,301 --> 00:15:49,956
- See you down the front at three?
- See you later then.

330
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:54,476
Thanks for nearly
fucking that up for me.

331
00:15:54,601 --> 00:15:56,518
I just don't want
things to get confusing,

332
00:15:56,643 --> 00:15:58,886
you can't meet up with
both of them, can you?

333
00:15:59,011 --> 00:16:02,282
Shit. I don't know.
I can't cancel Lauren, can I?

334
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:04,707
Look, Carli means something to you.

335
00:16:04,832 --> 00:16:07,122
You should go out with
her. I'll sort Lauren out.

336
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:09,564
Yeah. That's the right
thing to do, isn't it?

337
00:16:09,689 --> 00:16:11,248
Will you talk to Lauren then?

338
00:16:11,373 --> 00:16:13,454
Course. I'll let her
down gently for you, mate.

339
00:16:14,008 --> 00:16:17,602
He's going out with someone else and
he couldn't tell you. He's a twat.

340
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:20,322
I said I'd do it as I think
you deserve an explanation.

341
00:16:24,195 --> 00:16:26,468
That's a shame. Thanks, Will.

342
00:16:26,769 --> 00:16:30,322
Look. I've hired a boat this afternoon,
why don't you come out on it with me?

343
00:16:31,021 --> 00:16:32,762
- Oh, I'm not sure.
- Oh, go on!

344
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,602
Please?

345
00:16:36,606 --> 00:16:39,507
- Oh, all right then.
- They hire the boats out by the quay.

346
00:16:39,632 --> 00:16:42,109
If you see Simon, best not to
mention I said he was a twat.

347
00:16:42,806 --> 00:16:44,071
See you later, then.

348

for his sex-starved ice-cream lady.'</i>

349
00:16:51,188 --> 00:16:52,762
I don't know. She looks too old.

350
00:16:54,108 --> 00:16:57,544
We've been here two days and she's the
first bird we've seen hanging out here.

351
00:16:57,669 --> 00:16:59,950
She looks like she's only got one leg.

352
00:17:00,075 --> 00:17:01,893
She's probably just got an old face.

353
00:17:02,018 --> 00:17:03,885
Must be all the jizz she's had on it.

354
00:17:04,237 --> 00:17:06,379
I bet her body is still pretty fit.

355
00:17:06,504 --> 00:17:07,561
Hey, guys.

356
00:17:07,729 --> 00:17:10,246
- How's the sex search going?
- Jay thinks it's her.

357
00:17:11,438 --> 00:17:13,330
You must be joking. She's ancient.

358
00:17:13,455 --> 00:17:15,042
Nah, if she put on a bit of fake tan

359
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:17,682
and slipped into some sexy
undies, I'd give it a go.

360
00:17:18,302 --> 00:17:20,642
It must be her. I've given
everyone else the eye.

361
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:22,836
She looks like she could
give you her actual eye.

362
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:26,322
This is it.
It's now or never.

363
00:17:27,316 --> 00:17:28,764
Get us a 99, Jay.

364
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:35,402
- What can I get you?
- A cornetto please?

365
00:17:36,912 --> 00:17:38,967
One cornetto. Is that all?

366
00:17:41,929 --> 00:17:43,562
- Do you wanna lick it?
- Sorry?

367
00:17:44,406 --> 00:17:46,002
My cornetto... Do you wanna lick it?

368
00:17:47,578 --> 00:17:50,982
That is kind. I've had enough ice
cream today though, sweetheart.

369
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:53,309
Oh, right, bit late am I?

370
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:55,362
Do you want something else?

371
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:00,707
Are you the woman who
sucks schoolboys off?

372
00:18:01,152 --> 00:18:01,944
Sorry?

373
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:03,981
Can you suck me off?

374
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:10,081

- No.

<i>'A very old and confused brick wall.'</i>

377

Yes, a date with Carli.

378
00:18:22,136 --> 00:18:24,258
You have no idea how
long I've waited for this.

379
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:26,096
We have. You never shut about.

380
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:28,162
Oh, my God. What does he look like?

381
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:31,010
Permission to come
aboard, Captain Cockwash.

382
00:18:31,135 --> 00:18:32,722
Denied, I'm leaving in a minute.

383
00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:35,562
- You're going on a boat trip alone?
- That's tragic.

384
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:37,082
I'm not going on my own.

385
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,825
- Who you going with then?
- Lauren.

386
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:41,623
What? After you told me to not see her?

387
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,632
- I didn't say that.
- You said I should choose Carli.

388
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,832
Because she's the one
you want to be with.

389
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,272
And you want to be with
Lauren so you scared me off.

390
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,712
No, not at all.

391
00:18:51,188 --> 00:18:53,552
I dunno, I think that's
a bit dodgy, mate.

392
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,752
- Let's go.
- No.

393
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,072
- Please.
- No.

394
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,883
Go on, I love boats. I used
to go fishing with my dad.

395

- Fisting?
- Fishing.

396
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,312
Just take us up to the
sea. As you stitched me up.

397
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,352
No, she'll be here in 15 minutes.

Oh, I get it, he's scared.

That was great. Let's head back.

406
00:19:33,067 --> 00:19:34,943
What? You said we could go out to sea.

407
00:19:35,068 --> 00:19:38,712
Well, we can't. Put your life jacket
on, the sea is a cruel mistress.

408

What's this?

409
00:19:41,353 --> 00:19:44,003
- Is this the sail?
- It's a fishing line. Give it here.

410
00:19:45,163 --> 00:19:46,592
Neil, do not throw...

411
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,792
- What happens now?
- Nothing. You need bait.

412
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:53,410
Please don't muck around. There's
a £150 deposit on the boat.

Oh, cool, the sea. Let's get out there.

No, don't.

You are rocking the boat.
I knew this would happen,

417

- Holy fucking shit, that's cold.
- Get him out.

421

Why did you do that?
Was it because of Lauren?

422

No! God, no. It was an accident.

423

You total bell-end.

424

better head back in.

- What?

427

- I knew it.
- What?

430
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,712
You've been waiting for
this. I knew you were bent.

431
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,472
It's first aid. I was in
the Scouts and we did this.

432
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,515
That's not all you did in the Scouts.

433
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,466
No, you're right, we did knots too.

434
00:20:51,591 --> 00:20:53,552
Could someone get me hair gel?

435
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,839
Don't take his pants
off, you're not your dad.

436
00:20:55,964 --> 00:20:58,717
He has to, it's the safest way.
Put that coat qround him,

437
00:20:58,842 --> 00:21:01,140
I'll get the engine started.
Don't worry, I'll cover him up.

438

Fuck, why won't this start?
Jay, get that line in.

All right, all right.
Don't shit yourself.

440

- How has this happened?
- It's caught on something.

441
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,455
- It must be caught round the engine.
- Can I huddle up to someone?

442
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:18,832
I'm cold, is anyone else
cold? Like, really cold?

443
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,223
- Jesus Christ!
- Oh, my.

444
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:25,832
- How the hell has that happened?
- It didn't have any bait on it.

445
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,872
- Get it out.
- It's just a fish.

446
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:31,224
It's a fucking terrifying
massive fish. Get rid of it.

447
00:21:31,349 --> 00:21:33,352

- It's all right.

Why the fuck did you do that?!

453
00:21:56,139 --> 00:21:57,312
Get the sea police out.

454
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,712
And say what? Help, we've caught a fish?

455
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,584
And we're already in the
harbour?

456
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,045
Will they tow us four
feet closer to shore?

457
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:06,352
- What if it's a shark?
- It's not a shark!

458
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,751
- Get it out, Neil!
- I'd better kill it.

459
00:22:08,876 --> 00:22:11,703
It's the kindest thing to do. It
won't survive back in the sea now.

460
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:28,592
Well, that was a much
more dignified end for him.

461
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:31,632
- You punched a fish to death.
- We can take it back and eat it.

462
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,978
I'm not eating that, it's
come out the fucking sea.

463
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:36,106
I'm cold. Mummy, can you get the potty.

464
00:22:36,231 --> 00:22:38,297
Stay with us, Simon, we'll get you help.

465
00:22:38,422 --> 00:22:41,233
Oh, fuck! Fuck it!

466
00:22:42,184 --> 00:22:43,501
Are you OK, Will?

467
00:22:43,843 --> 00:22:45,743
Fine thanks. Be back
for you in a minute.

468
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,782
You know you sent a flare up?

469
00:22:48,848 --> 00:22:50,874
Thanks, Lauren, won't be a minute.

470
00:22:51,545 --> 00:22:52,548
It's a fish?!

471
00:22:52,673 --> 00:22:54,954
Yes, Lauren, it's a fucking fish!

472
00:22:55,079 --> 00:22:56,352
Give me a minute!

473
00:22:57,461 --> 00:22:59,122
Are we going to have to swim back?

474
00:22:59,247 --> 00:23:00,872
It's very cold in there.

475
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,505
We'll row back. On
holiday in Spain one year,

476
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:05,859
me and my mate took a pedalo to Africa.

477
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,991
Could you could
spare us the bullshit?

478
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:12,159
For one minute while I try to
figure out how not to die at sea.

479
00:23:12,661 --> 00:23:14,545
Oh, Carli's there. Look.

480
00:23:16,866 --> 00:23:17,957
Hi, Carli.

481
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,593
Oh, Neil, you put a sock on it.

482
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,865
Is it a bit draughty?

483
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:25,392
We must huddle round him
till the lifeboat arrives,

484
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:29,312
then we have to explain that we
called them because we caught a fish.

485
00:23:30,846 --> 00:23:33,632
- Come here, mate.
- Oh, I can see his helmet.

486
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,556
If anything I'm colder than before.

487
00:23:35,681 --> 00:23:37,512
Well, huddle in closer then.

488
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:39,761
No-one better find out about this.

489
00:23:39,886 --> 00:23:42,156
What apart from everyone over there?

490
00:23:44,042 --> 00:23:46,182
Now, we just wait for the sea police.

491
00:23:52,196 --> 00:23:53,935
I'm worried this might look weird.

492
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:55,395
No, it's totally fine.

493
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:59,256
We went out for a boat ride and now
we've been dragged back to shore,

494
00:23:59,381 --> 00:24:01,720
the boat's covered in fish
brains and you're naked.

495
00:24:01,845 --> 00:24:03,932
Carli and Lauren will
think this is pretty cool?

496
00:24:04,057 --> 00:24:05,740
Oh, yeah. Pretty cool.
