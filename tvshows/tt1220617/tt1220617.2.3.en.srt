The Inbetweeners 2x03
"Will's Birthday"

4
00:00:21,258 --> 00:00:24,094
<i>To the untrained eye, it may
look like another day at school.

5
00:00:24,214 --> 00:00:25,959
<i>Actually,
it was a very special week.

6
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,395
<i>Or, in Neil's case,
a very special needs week.

7
00:00:28,515 --> 00:00:29,759
Bollocks, not possible.

8
00:00:30,709 --> 00:00:32,439
You OK, Neil?
What are you playing?

9
00:00:32,601 --> 00:00:34,571
Oh, behave. That's well too hard.

10
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,065
Brain Training?

11
00:00:36,185 --> 00:00:38,679
Stupid thing. Why's that wrong?

12
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,520
- What is your brain age is Neil?
- I got it up to 12 a minute ago.

13
00:00:42,398 --> 00:00:44,098
12? 12 years old?

14
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,840
Are you trisomic or something?

15
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:47,960
Has it asked if Santa is real?

16
00:00:48,269 --> 00:00:50,119
Don't listen to them Neil.
He does exist.

17
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,416
Yeah, and he's just sorted out
our Saturday night

18
00:00:52,536 --> 00:00:54,025
with the gift of gash.

19
00:00:54,145 --> 00:00:56,159
Sexy soiree? That sounds sexy.

20
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,239
Fucking hell, is that Louise Graham?
She doesn't normally look like that.

21
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,719
Oh, she'd definitely get it.
Right in the bumhole.

22
00:01:01,987 --> 00:01:02,848
Lucky girl.

23
00:01:02,968 --> 00:01:06,022
This is amazing,
we have been invited to a cool party.

24
00:01:06,635 --> 00:01:07,399
Kind of.

25
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,960
I nicked this out of
Sadie Cunningham's bag in registration.

26
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,616
- We should try and go.
- Oh, so it's another cool party

27
00:01:12,736 --> 00:01:14,360
we're specifically not invited?

28
00:01:14,682 --> 00:01:15,480
Good job.

29
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:18,679
Isn't there something else
on Saturday anyway?

30
00:01:19,124 --> 00:01:19,841
No.

31
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,440
My birthday.

32
00:01:22,932 --> 00:01:23,999
A dinner party.

33
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,877
I sent you the invites a month ago.

34
00:01:26,997 --> 00:01:28,880
Is that real?
I thought it was a joke.

35
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,200
It's a joke that we've got to go to
a dinner party rather than a sex party.

36
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,251
Two things:

37
00:01:33,371 --> 00:01:35,021
One, it won't be a sex party,

38
00:01:35,141 --> 00:01:37,280
it's Louise Graham we're talking about.
Two...

39
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,759
Even if it is,
you were invited to my party first.

40
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,439
Just cancel yours,
you can have your birthday any weekend.

41
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,375
Thanks.

42
00:01:43,495 --> 00:01:45,856
Simon, you don't want to go
to Louise Graham's, do you?

43
00:01:45,976 --> 00:01:48,200
Me? No, God no. No.

44
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,400
- Not unless the cancel of yours?
- I'm not.

45
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,291
Sure.

46
00:01:52,843 --> 00:01:53,567
Sure.

47
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:56,229
Except my French exchange bloke
arrives today

48
00:01:56,349 --> 00:01:58,960
- and I'll have to look after him.
- Bring him along.

49
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,279
It'll be nice to have
some sophistication at the party.

50
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,960
I don't know if he's sophisticated.
Mum's friends asked if we'd have him.

51
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:08,120
- He might be a massive twat.
- He's the French version of you!

52
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,680
Don't forget you have to bring a girl.
I'd like it to be a proper dinner party.

53
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,560
- Can I ask your mum?
- No.

54
00:02:14,187 --> 00:02:17,159
<i>So, after school,
we went to say bonjour to Patrice.

55
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,720
How is France, Patrice?

56
00:02:20,583 --> 00:02:21,320
Cool.

57
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,119
And are French birds dirty?

58
00:02:23,595 --> 00:02:27,101
- Quoi?
- He doesn't get any, he's all greasy.

59
00:02:27,221 --> 00:02:28,867
Birds don't go for that,
French or not.

60
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:37,239
Pardon?

61
00:02:40,131 --> 00:02:41,651
I thought you said that.

62
00:02:41,771 --> 00:02:43,599
- You'll be OK here.
- What did he say?

63
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,759
- Do you not speak any French?
- No.

64
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,640
That's why my mum was keen
for him to come over to teach me a bit.

65
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,639
- I've picked up "clope" so far.
- What?

66
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,650
Cigarette. He smokes like a chimney.

67
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:54,120
Simon. You have porn?

68
00:02:54,491 --> 00:02:56,639
Oh, for fuck's sake,
I keep saying... No I don't.

69
00:02:57,006 --> 00:02:58,439
Internet?
No.

70
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,119
You can't see porn on internet?

71
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,920
That's not the internet, Si.

72
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,119
Are you trying to get porn
on the washing machine?

73
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,279
My parents have put a filter.
I can't see any.

74
00:03:07,044 --> 00:03:10,160
That's fucking tragic.
What are you, 11?

75
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,320
All right.

76
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,546
See you later.

77
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:20,399
He seems a bit weird. He asked
if I'd tried the "sleeping beauty".

78
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,320
- Oh, it's good that.
- You know it?

79
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,248
Yeah.

80
00:03:23,531 --> 00:03:25,533
You sit on your arm
till your hand goes dead.

81
00:03:25,653 --> 00:03:27,280
Ten or fifteen minutes.

82
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,479
And then,
It's like someone else wank you.

83
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,200
How do you know these things?

84
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,799
Everyone knows the "sleeping beauty",
that's old.

85
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,120
- Is it?
- Yeah.

86
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,923
My mate's brother invented it.

87
00:03:37,043 --> 00:03:39,320
He and his mates used to be called
the Dead Hand Gang.

88
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,639
They had a gang
based on masturbation?

89
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,640
Nothing gay about that.

90
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,959
Yeah, well he's in the air force,
now so how gay is that?

91
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,359
Still quite gay.

92
00:03:47,828 --> 00:03:50,349
<i>So, my dinner party guest list
was shaping up nicely.

93
00:03:50,469 --> 00:03:52,040
<i>Four idiots and a racist Frenchman.

94
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,636
It's going to be tricky to get girls
to come to your party.

95
00:03:54,756 --> 00:03:56,600
Because you forgot
and it's short notice?

96
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,760
No, cos Louise Graham's quite popular.
Most people will be at hers.

97
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,159
Please, say you'll at least
try to bring girls.

98
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,240
This birthday can't be
as bad as last year's.

99
00:04:04,401 --> 00:04:06,440
- What, because you got a briefcase?
- No.

100
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,280
- Because my father left my mother.
- I'll see what Carli's up to.

101
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,880
Not being seen dead with you
in a million years is what!

102
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:15,199
I'm sorry, Russell Brand,
who are you bringing again?

103
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,199
Don't worry about me. I'm up to
my neck in sluts at the moment.

104
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,169
Maybe I'll bring my new fuck buddy.

105
00:04:20,289 --> 00:04:23,680
- That barmaid from the Fox and Hounds.
- You've pulled a barmaid? Nice.

106
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,680
Has she got
special dietary requirements?

107
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,800
I've never cooked
for an imaginary woman before.

108
00:04:28,062 --> 00:04:29,680
I know she's not allergic to nuts.

109
00:04:30,515 --> 00:04:31,920
- My nuts.
- Brilliant.

110
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,800
- Or my cock.
- She eats small portions?

111
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,040
I didn't hear your mum complaining
although her mouth was full.

112
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,120
Good one!

113
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,479
Just drop us off here.

114
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:42,440
- Don't you want a lift to school?
- Yeah, this is close enough.

115
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,480
We don't want to be seen
in this shit heap.

116
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,639
No offence.

117
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,296
See you later.

118
00:04:49,598 --> 00:04:51,061
Actually I might get out too.

119
00:04:51,181 --> 00:04:52,680
Fine, see you at school.

120
00:04:57,118 --> 00:04:58,880
- You want to get in the front?
- No.

121
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,926
Great...

122
00:05:00,568 --> 00:05:03,447
<i>They say the quickest way
to a man's heart is through his stomach.

123
00:05:03,567 --> 00:05:06,399
<i>I was hoping it would be a way
into my female guests knickers.

124
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:08,316
What about a chicken casserole?

125
00:05:08,436 --> 00:05:09,800
Why are you even asking?

126
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,679
With me, we'd all have Big Macs.

127
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,200
Did you not see Super Size Me?

128
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,439
Yeah.
It just made me really want a Big Mac.

129
00:05:16,507 --> 00:05:18,237
Shit, Charlotte's online.

130
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,920
- You asked her along yet?
- No. I should?

131
00:05:21,768 --> 00:05:23,609
Go on, it'll be great.
Message her now.

132
00:05:23,729 --> 00:05:26,239
- Really, do you think so?
- Yeah, it's cool, just say "Hi".

133
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,360
All right.

134
00:05:27,878 --> 00:05:28,600
Done.

135
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,960
- She's come straight back.
- She says, "Hi, whassup".

136
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,119
Smiley face.

137
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,520
- Ask her out.
- No, can't just jump in,

138
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,520
not the way things have been with us.
Have to charm her a bit first.

139
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:42,079
I've written "Just hanging out
with Si and his French exchange".

140
00:05:42,892 --> 00:05:43,920
You're handsome?

141
00:05:46,685 --> 00:05:48,640
Oh, no. She means Patrice.
Thank god.

142
00:05:49,442 --> 00:05:50,320
I'm a div.

143
00:05:52,189 --> 00:05:53,360
Another smiley face.

144
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,916
Can't bring myself to send
a smiley back,

145
00:05:56,371 --> 00:05:58,880
- But I could write "lol" if I had to.
- Do that.

146
00:06:01,407 --> 00:06:03,239
It's going well, mate, ask her out.

147
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,311
- It's going well, no?
- Definitely.

148
00:06:07,104 --> 00:06:08,440
"My birthday.
You come?"

149
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,480
- That pause isn't good.
- Calm down, it's only been a second.

150
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,480
She was straight back
every time before.

151
00:06:22,276 --> 00:06:23,519
Holy shit.

152
00:06:23,681 --> 00:06:27,079
She's gone offline rather than answer
or not if she'll come to my birthday.

153
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,360
- The connection dropped?
- No it was back and forward,

154
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,054
back and forward. Then a question
about dinner and she's gone.

155
00:06:32,174 --> 00:06:33,920
Brilliant, thanks a bunch!

156
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,960
- Look, she didn't say "No", did she?
- No. But she did hang up.

157
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,572
I'm sure she'll be there.

158
00:06:39,182 --> 00:06:41,439
Well, not sure, but you know.

159
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,080
Hello, Simon.

160
00:06:43,579 --> 00:06:44,439
Bonjour.

161
00:06:45,299 --> 00:06:46,480
My Goodness, French.

162
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,519
This is Patrice,
he's my sort of French exchange,

163
00:06:51,132 --> 00:06:52,838
Patrice this is Will's mum.

164
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,040
Hello.

165
00:06:55,836 --> 00:06:57,974
Well, I'm just going to play tennis.

166
00:06:59,447 --> 00:07:00,480
Why I said that?

167
00:07:01,996 --> 00:07:02,917
Bye then.

168
00:07:03,786 --> 00:07:05,880
- Au revoir, Patrice.
- Au revoir.

169
00:07:13,739 --> 00:07:15,999
- Your mother is very sexy.
- Sorry?

170
00:07:16,304 --> 00:07:17,760
She has the sex.

171
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:24,771
He's a strange one isn't he?

172
00:07:24,891 --> 00:07:27,279
Yep, but he's French,
they're all weird aren't they?

173
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,880
- Oh, god, please don't be racist.
- That's not racist,

174
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,501
I'm just saying that he barely says
anything and when he does speak

175
00:07:33,621 --> 00:07:35,238
it's always about sex.

176
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,920
Just like all French people.

177
00:07:40,486 --> 00:07:42,248
<i>The next day was my birthday.

178
00:07:42,368 --> 00:07:44,489
<i>Mum was serving me
up her speciality,

179
00:07:44,609 --> 00:07:46,646
<i>scrambled eggs and disappointment.

180
00:07:47,067 --> 00:07:49,379
- Happy birthday, petal.
- Thanks, Mum.

181
00:07:49,499 --> 00:07:50,999
Here's your present.

182
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,759
It's nothing big because I'm saving up
for something special next year,

183
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,419
when you can drive.

184
00:07:55,876 --> 00:07:57,840
Next year? I can drive this year.

185
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,199
- I thought you had to be 18 to drive?
- No, it's 17.

186
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:03,403
Right.

187
00:08:03,982 --> 00:08:06,335
Sorry, your father used to deal
with things like that.

188
00:08:08,134 --> 00:08:09,801
Thanks, mum. Calvin Klein.

189
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,052
It is...

190
00:08:11,924 --> 00:08:13,740
It's a tight vest top.

191
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,559
- Don't you like the colour?
- Is this the only present you got me?

192
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,799
A problem?

193
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,960
When have you see me
wear something like that?

194
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,479
You'll look cool.
All the boy bands wear them.

195
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,360
- I'm not in a boy band.
- Fine. Fine. I've got a receipt.

196
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,800
You can exchange it. I'm sorry.

197
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,626
I've ruined your big day.

198
00:08:29,746 --> 00:08:32,200
I got it wrong about the driving
and about this.

199
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,960
No, mum, sorry.

200
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:36,320
I suppose it's not too bad.

201
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,860
- You don't want me to exchange it?
- No,

202
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,159
I'll wear it.

203
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:41,560
Tonight?

204
00:08:44,368 --> 00:08:45,279
Not tonight.

205
00:08:45,605 --> 00:08:48,376
- You hate it. I'll change it.
- No, fine.

206
00:08:48,496 --> 00:08:50,016
I'll wear it tonight.

207
00:08:53,146 --> 00:08:55,903
Patrice spends an awfully long time
in the shower doesn't he?

208
00:08:56,023 --> 00:08:57,264
Yeah, about him.

209
00:08:57,384 --> 00:09:00,239
As it's Will's birthday tonight,
could you look after Patrice?

210
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,677
No, you're meant
to be learning from him.

211
00:09:04,045 --> 00:09:05,719
Anyway we're going out.

212
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,560
- Can't you take him with you?
- It's a special night out for us.

213
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,489
We don't really need
a 17 year old French boy tagging along.

214
00:09:11,609 --> 00:09:13,519
Things haven't got that bad
in the bedroom yet!

215
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,770
Jesus Christ.

216
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,358
- He'll have more fun with you.
- He doesn't.

217
00:09:18,478 --> 00:09:20,555
He just sits around
rolling cigarettes and shrugging.

218
00:09:20,675 --> 00:09:23,639
Must be useful having a handsome
Frenchman in tow to meet the ladies?

219
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,119
He's not handsome.

220
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,694
Patrice is handsome.

221
00:09:27,803 --> 00:09:30,568
I'd better watch it! Looks like
your mother is lining up a toy boy!

222
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,159
Oh, god.

223
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,839
Chance would be a fine thing.

224
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,640
- Not you too.
- Remember gorgeous,

225
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,920
what I lack in energy
I make up for in experience.

226
00:09:40,571 --> 00:09:42,303
God, you two are disgusting.

227
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,960
Come on, you used to look
at far worse on internet.

228
00:09:49,414 --> 00:09:50,770
<i>Elsewhere on the internet,

229
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:53,729
<i>the dead hand gang
was enrolling its latest recruit.

230
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,970
Jay, Neil's here for you.

231
00:09:59,250 --> 00:09:59,999
What?

232
00:10:00,285 --> 00:10:02,720
He's early.
Don't come in, I'm getting changed.

233
00:10:04,184 --> 00:10:05,800
- Are you OK?
- It's just a film.

234
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,617
It's just a normal film.
I'm getting changed. Get out.

235
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,006
What film's that, then?

236
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,360
Oh, right.

237
00:10:18,717 --> 00:10:20,891
<i>Whilst I was making
my final preparations,

238
00:10:21,011 --> 00:10:23,210
<i>including putting on
shit music girls would like,

239
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:24,600
<i>Patrice had been busy too.

240
00:10:25,589 --> 00:10:29,818
I just had a really nice...
Tug, thinking about your mother.

241
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,560
- I think some went on the floor. Sorry.
- Great, thanks, Patrice.

242
00:10:35,987 --> 00:10:39,008
- I'll get it. It could be Charlotte.
- Well, it's not going to be Charlotte.

243
00:10:39,128 --> 00:10:42,680
Cheer up, it might be. She's got
the details, you said so yourself.

244
00:10:43,838 --> 00:10:44,799
All right, gays.

245
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,891
<i>Happy birthday to me.

246
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:50,918
<i>It was 8.30pm on my 17th birthday,

247
00:10:51,038 --> 00:10:52,800
<i>and my party was in full swing.

248
00:10:55,881 --> 00:10:58,567
- Where's your plus one then, Jay?
- Not coming.

249
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:00,671
She got a modelling job,
had to fly to Paris.

250
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:03,440
Barmaid by day, supermodel by night.
Sounds likely.

251
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,560
Where's
Little Miss Stuck-up Cock-tease?

252
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,452
- Do you mean Carli?
- Yep.

253
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,024
Yeah,
I don't think Carli will make it.

254
00:11:10,418 --> 00:11:12,859
- Why not? Is something up?
- No, it's nothing like that.

255
00:11:13,072 --> 00:11:13,878
I just...

256
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:16,760
- Sort of didn't invite her in the end.
- You really are

257
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,520
a bollockless little twat, yeah?

258
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:20,720
So there will be no women here then?

259
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,917
None at all?

260
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,182
I don't know why I bother.

261
00:11:24,302 --> 00:11:26,616
Well, I wouldn't say
there will be no women...

262
00:11:26,736 --> 00:11:28,640
Yeah, not no women!

263
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,120
So a women is coming?

264
00:11:30,652 --> 00:11:32,520
- Maybe, maybe not.
- Look,

265
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:36,680
it's very clear from your funny faces
and tone of voice that actually,

266
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,720
- there are some women coming.
- We got you a special birthday treat.

267
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,600
- Did you?
- Stripper!

268
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,280
What?

269
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,320
- Have you really booked a stripper?
- Yeah!

270
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,080
- She was only 150 quid!
- How did you pay for that?

271
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,400
We'll have a whip-round
when she gets here.

272
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,918
A whip-round?

273
00:11:53,038 --> 00:11:56,560
Round who? The five of us?
We don't have 30 quid each!

274
00:11:57,426 --> 00:11:59,536
No, if we all put in... Wait...

275
00:12:02,628 --> 00:12:05,630
- Shit, yeah.
- Brilliant. So just to confirm,

276
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:09,640
until an angry stripper turns up,
we are without any female company?

277
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,600
Thanks guys,
this is a great birthday.

278
00:12:12,187 --> 00:12:15,281
If you're gonna cry about it,
I'll get some local snatch in.

279
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,618
- And them birds we saw outside?
- Yeah, they were nice.

280
00:12:17,738 --> 00:12:21,320
Yes, please, drag some random girls
off the street for me!

281
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,600
Or we could go
to Louise Graham's party?

282
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,240
Yeah, why aren't we there? It's got
to be better than this shithole.

283
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,960
Thanks very much. More wine?

284
00:12:29,526 --> 00:12:31,440
I bet it's crawling with clunge.

285
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,593
- And I bet it's not!
- Yeah, and you'd know?

286
00:12:33,713 --> 00:12:35,372
I've put lots of effort into this.

287
00:12:35,492 --> 00:12:37,800
- Made a really nice coq au vin...
- Cock of what?

288
00:12:38,568 --> 00:12:40,033
You don't help yourself!

289
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:41,861
Yes, I see.

290
00:12:42,113 --> 00:12:43,800
"Coq au vin", very mature.

291
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,800
It means chicken in wine,
right Patrice?

292
00:12:46,684 --> 00:12:48,273
- Quoi?
- Well, it does.

293
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:50,911
And it doesn't mean
cock up my arse, or...

294
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,920
cock on my head, or...

295
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,720
You go cock in the back of a van?

296
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,200
Or that I got a cock
in the back of a van.

297
00:12:57,598 --> 00:13:01,080
Look, all I wanted was
a civilised and sophisticated birthday.

298
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,800
Just, something a bit different
from the usual parties,

299
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,520
maybe even the sort of party
that girls are impressed by.

300
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,359
OK, so there aren't any girls here,

301
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:11,560
but why don't we at least attempt
to have a sophisticated conversation?

302
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,246
I know it's a tall order,
and I'm not expecting sparkling,

303
00:13:14,366 --> 00:13:17,461
but give it a go?!
As it is my fucking birthday!

304
00:13:24,542 --> 00:13:27,894
- How much Lego can you put in your bum?
- For Christ's sake!

305
00:13:28,014 --> 00:13:30,640
Not now, just when you was younger.
How much?

306
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,800
You are grim.

307
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:33,900
Why were you sticking
Lego up your bum?

308
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,442
Not a lot, just like...

309
00:13:35,562 --> 00:13:38,200
a rectangular one and a long one.
Couple of singles, maybe.

310
00:13:38,646 --> 00:13:42,280
Fine, fine, let's see if those girls
outside want to come join us then.

311
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,118
Yes!

312
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,680
Are you sure?
I thought you wanted this to be special?

313
00:13:47,016 --> 00:13:49,262
Why fight it?
Charlotte's not coming, is she?

314
00:13:49,382 --> 00:13:52,315
And a skilful raconteur like Neil
is wasted on just us.

315
00:13:52,435 --> 00:13:55,306
Nice one.
Now I get a proper three-course meal,

316
00:13:55,426 --> 00:13:57,792
blowie, shag and anal.

317
00:13:58,085 --> 00:13:59,720
<i>So we headed into the night,

318
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,449
<i>and found Jay's three courses
sitting on a fence.

319
00:14:02,569 --> 00:14:04,960
- Allo, allo. Here they are.
- Nice.

320
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,120
They look a bit rough.
Are they drinking in the street?

321
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:09,434
Dirty.

322
00:14:09,554 --> 00:14:12,840
Not the sophisticates I had in mind,
but at least they're female.

323
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,360
- You going over then, Jay?
- Nah, Si should.

324
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,840
- What? Why me?
- Alphabetical.

325
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,600
You got that bent look girls go for.

326
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,858
Fine, if you're going to be rude,
you go then.

327
00:14:22,753 --> 00:14:25,600
- Sorry for being rude!
- Just go, Si, it's freezing out here.

328
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,762
Come on, Si, for me, yeah?
For my birthday?

329
00:14:30,108 --> 00:14:31,480
God, all right then.

330
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,640
- Hi, there.
- What did you fucking say?

331
00:14:37,392 --> 00:14:39,017
- Hello.
- And what?

332
00:14:39,892 --> 00:14:41,560
I wanted to ask you to a party?

333
00:14:41,845 --> 00:14:42,880
I'm 13.

334
00:14:43,247 --> 00:14:44,120
Oh, right.

335
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,440
- And she's 11, you nonce.
- Yep.

336
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,480
- There's been a mistake, so...
- Like looking at little girls, do ya?

337
00:14:49,856 --> 00:14:52,560
Like getting them to parties
where you can touch them, do ya?

338
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,034
No, God, no. Look, I'm going now.

339
00:14:55,154 --> 00:14:56,000
Paedo!

340
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,626
- You fucking paedo!
- Yeah, run, you paedo.

341
00:14:59,123 --> 00:15:01,200
- Fucking hell, don't do that, Patrice.
- Paedo

342
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,369
- I'll get my brother on you.
- That's it, run away, paedo boy.

343
00:15:04,489 --> 00:15:05,880
Keep going, paedo!

344
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,920
Keep walking, you fucking paedo!

345
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,520
- Nice one, Si.
- Me? It was Patrice who wound them up.

346
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:14,400
- You tried to nonce them up.
- I'm not in the mood, just warning you.

347
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:17,760
"Ooh, watch out, Uncle Simon
might give me a special cuddle."

348
00:15:17,921 --> 00:15:18,680
Fuck.

349
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:23,274
- What's for pudding, Will?
- A middle-aged woman demanding 150£.

350
00:15:23,499 --> 00:15:25,120
Shit. What are we going to do?

351
00:15:25,836 --> 00:15:28,571
- I think we should go...
- Yes, fine, I give up.

352
00:15:28,691 --> 00:15:31,704
- Let's try to get in to Louise's party.
- What about your dinner party?

353
00:15:31,824 --> 00:15:33,557
Forget it.
You can lead a horse to water

354
00:15:33,677 --> 00:15:35,600
but can't stop it
sticking Lego up its bum.

355
00:15:35,891 --> 00:15:38,115
For Christ's sake,
Patrice, don't do that!

356
00:15:38,235 --> 00:15:40,040
God, Si, he's a nightmare!

357
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,680
We can't have him scare all the muff
away at the party. Let's ditch him.

358
00:15:44,116 --> 00:15:47,160
I suppose to be looking after him,
I can't leave him stranded here.

359
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:50,600
- He comes from a strange country.
- Si, for once, Jay is right.

360
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,714
Patrice is weird and boring.

361
00:15:52,834 --> 00:15:55,753
Do you really think girls will be
impressed when we turn up with that?

362
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,920
- Probably not.
- His back is turned, let's just leg it.

363
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:02,320
Now or never.

364
00:16:03,974 --> 00:16:05,240
OK, fuck it, come on then.

365
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,812
<i>So we ran away. Yep, ran away.

366
00:16:07,932 --> 00:16:11,108
<i>Something I hadn't done since
John Cook discovered wedgies in Year 8.

367
00:16:11,228 --> 00:16:14,680
- I've got a stitch.
- Right, that should be enough.

368
00:16:16,613 --> 00:16:18,034
He's behind us!

369
00:16:18,154 --> 00:16:19,703
- No way!
- Run!

370
00:16:21,343 --> 00:16:22,821
He's chasing us!

371
00:16:23,347 --> 00:16:25,720
Fucking hell,
he doesn't give up easily, does he?

372
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,200
What does he think?

373
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:31,880
- I think he's caught us up.
- Yeah, good spot, Neil.

374
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,360
Simon, why we run?

375
00:16:33,978 --> 00:16:35,200
Yeah, dunno.

376
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:36,787
- You don't know?
- Yeah.

377
00:16:36,907 --> 00:16:39,321
- So we stop?
- Yeah, probably. Good idea.

378
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:47,440
So, we go to the party?

379
00:16:47,968 --> 00:16:51,035
<i>So after trying and failing
to outrun a boy in Cuban heels,

380
00:16:51,155 --> 00:16:54,498
<i>we headed for Louise Graham's party,
which we definitely wouldn't get into.

381
00:16:54,618 --> 00:16:56,576
- Who's gonna ask if we can come in?
- Will?

382
00:16:56,696 --> 00:17:00,000
- I don't even know her!
- I stuck candies in her hair in Year 8.

383
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,920
Great. Anyone else fucked her off?

384
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,896
Out the way you Kwik Shit Shitters,
I'll sort this.

385
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,160
Yeah?

386
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,640
Hello, Louise.
We've never been introduced. I'm Will.

387
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,720
You can't come in,
there's too many already.

388
00:17:18,356 --> 00:17:21,039
Look, we'll be no trouble, I promise.
I mean, look at us.

389
00:17:21,928 --> 00:17:25,052
- One of you can come in.
- One, five, there's no difference,

390
00:17:25,172 --> 00:17:27,176
- perhaps we could negotiate...
- Him.

391
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,161
He can come in.

392
00:17:29,685 --> 00:17:31,040
Right, well the thing is,

393
00:17:31,201 --> 00:17:34,360
Simon will have to come in, too,
he's supposed to be looking after...

394
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:35,600
Great.

395
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:39,120
So we can add Patrice to the growing
list of people more popular than us.

396
00:17:40,654 --> 00:17:43,397
Fucking John's in there!
And he's with a girl!

397
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,000
- He's got his hand on her tit!
- This is too tragic.

398
00:17:46,353 --> 00:17:48,639
- And Charlotte Big Jugs is in there.
- Where?

399
00:17:48,759 --> 00:17:50,640
Right. Time for Plan B.

400
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,800
Right, there's a Plan B, is there?

401
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:57,800
Plan A was so brilliantly devised
I haven't thought we'd need a Plan B!

402
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,680
What is it? Climb over her fence?

403
00:18:00,459 --> 00:18:03,040
- It's a bit higher than I imagined.
- Don't shit yourself.

404
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,878
- It's only a fence, it won't bite.
- Yes, I'm not worried about it biting.

405
00:18:06,998 --> 00:18:08,880
I'm worried about breaking my neck.

406
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,034
Come on, it'll be a laugh,
climbing and that.

407
00:18:11,154 --> 00:18:13,359
Will it?
There must be another way.

408
00:18:14,481 --> 00:18:16,400
It's full of clunge.
Give us a push, Neil.

409
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:19,366
I'm just not made for climbing.

410
00:18:22,595 --> 00:18:26,576
Maybe one of these panels is loose.
There's a gap here!

411
00:18:31,069 --> 00:18:32,812
Come on, Will. Hurry up!

412
00:18:35,286 --> 00:18:36,280
Please, no!

413
00:18:37,234 --> 00:18:39,120
- Why's he always different?
- Hurry up,

414
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,871
you twat, everyone's looking.

415
00:18:40,991 --> 00:18:42,235
What's going on?

416
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,640
Hi, Louise. As I was saying, it's quite
important we look after Patrice.

417
00:18:47,048 --> 00:18:48,520
Have you crawled in my dog's shit?

418
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:51,040
Yes, I have. But ask yourself why?

419
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,240
That you've excluded us
from this party

420
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,608
because of some vague rules
about popularity is ridiculous.

421
00:18:56,728 --> 00:19:00,160
Although it looks like we climbed a
fence and crawled through dog shit,

422
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,880
what we've done is challenged
your social apartheid.

423
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,920
You weren't invited
cos I don't know you well.

424
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:07,000
That makes sense too.

425
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,400
God, if you're that desperate
then you can stay.

426
00:19:09,966 --> 00:19:11,715
But take that jacket off
before you go in.

427
00:19:13,511 --> 00:19:16,720
- Sweet, nice one!
- She's right about the jacket though,

428
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,910
it stinks.

429
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,856
Mate, that is rank.
It's all up your sleeve, look.

430
00:19:21,582 --> 00:19:22,400
Christ!

431
00:19:24,441 --> 00:19:26,280
What the fuck is that?

432
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,032
Oh, my God.

433
00:19:28,358 --> 00:19:31,040
- It was a present from my mum, OK?
- And you've worn it?

434
00:19:31,387 --> 00:19:33,560
She been getting gift ideas
from Neil's old man?

435
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,350
- My dad's not bent.
- Honestly, that is not a good look.

436
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:39,240
We've just gatecrashed a party
that Big John was invited to,

437
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,240
so nobody is winning the cool prize.

438
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,600
But you are losing by a mile.

439
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,080
Not for long.
I'm going to find Charlotte.

440
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,680
- Upstairs getting fucked, most likely.
- I've told you she's not like that!

441
00:19:51,908 --> 00:19:53,387
I'll check upstairs first.

442
00:19:53,507 --> 00:19:56,950
<i>The best thing in birthday is everyone
has to do exactly what you want.

443
00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:00,309
<i>With this in mind,
I went to find Charlotte.

444
00:20:00,429 --> 00:20:01,545
Nice T-shirt!

445
00:20:02,748 --> 00:20:04,575
- Yeah, good look, briefcase.
- Thanks.

446
00:20:04,695 --> 00:20:06,844
- Someone's stolen your sleeves.
- Yep, nice one.

447
00:20:06,964 --> 00:20:09,380
- Where's the rest of Take That?
- Retro, but a good one.

448
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:13,176
Come on! Let me go first,
you know I'm desperate.

449
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:15,220
- Unlucky.
- Don't be a cock!

450
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:17,794
No, don't. Seriously, come on,

451
00:20:17,914 --> 00:20:19,526
I'm bursting! Look, come on!

452
00:20:24,873 --> 00:20:26,980
- Hi, Jay, are you queuing?
- Yeah!

453
00:20:27,411 --> 00:20:28,900
I might piss my pants any minute.

454
00:20:31,805 --> 00:20:33,984
Won't be too long,
been in there a while.

455
00:20:34,104 --> 00:20:34,912
Right.

456
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:38,540
So, didn't know
you were friends with Louise.

457
00:20:38,848 --> 00:20:40,499
No, we're not. No.

458
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:42,300
We climbed the fence, It's cool!

459
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,286
Right.

460
00:20:45,915 --> 00:20:47,852
- Carli, hi.
- Hi, how are you?

461
00:20:47,972 --> 00:20:50,020
Good, yeah. OK.
Yeah, pretty awesome.

462
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:53,220
Jesus Christ, Simon,
what the fuck have you done in there?

463
00:20:53,488 --> 00:20:54,252
What?

464
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:56,683
Have you been eating cat food again?

465
00:20:57,351 --> 00:20:59,685
God, you've left skids
down the bowl too.

466
00:20:59,805 --> 00:21:00,780
I didn't.

467
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,902
- I only went in for a piss.
- Oh, God.

468
00:21:04,569 --> 00:21:06,260
- I can taste it.
- Jay!

469
00:21:06,634 --> 00:21:09,500
- I might go upstairs.
- No, don't. It was a wee.

470
00:21:09,926 --> 00:21:11,020
It was only a wee!

471
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,820
I promise I didn't leave skids!

472
00:21:14,628 --> 00:21:17,580
It doesn't smell at all, you fucker,
it was a wee. Why did you do that?

473
00:21:18,941 --> 00:21:19,660
Funny.

474
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:23,019
<i>So things weren't going exactly to plan.
But if I could just find Charlotte,

475
00:21:23,139 --> 00:21:25,795
<i>I was confident it would
still be a birthday to remember.

476
00:21:26,117 --> 00:21:27,408
<i>And I was right.

477
00:21:28,601 --> 00:21:29,768
Hi, Charlotte.

478
00:21:30,204 --> 00:21:31,860
- There you are.
- Will!

479
00:21:32,851 --> 00:21:34,380
Could you, go away?

480
00:21:35,165 --> 00:21:37,640
- Time out, fella!
- You're not alone now.

481
00:21:39,402 --> 00:21:40,414
Patrice...

482
00:21:41,253 --> 00:21:42,820
- Salut.
- Salut.

483
00:21:44,255 --> 00:21:46,340
- Are you two...?
- Seriously, what are you doing?

484
00:21:46,501 --> 00:21:48,380
I thought we could...
Hang out a bit.

485
00:21:49,009 --> 00:21:51,540
- Not right now, maybe.
- I don't know why you're doing this.

486
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:54,565
- And what are you wearing?
- I've got a bottle of champagne,

487
00:21:54,685 --> 00:21:58,620
and I remembered when we first met
we had champagne, as it's my birthday,

488
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,820
I thought maybe...
Is he touching you, now?

489
00:22:00,981 --> 00:22:01,682
Look,

490
00:22:02,186 --> 00:22:04,060
maybe we'll have a drink later.

491
00:22:04,746 --> 00:22:05,829
Yeah, later,

492
00:22:06,494 --> 00:22:07,490
of course.

493
00:22:08,523 --> 00:22:10,823
Will?
Could you turn the light off?

494
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:12,463
No, leave on.

495
00:22:13,848 --> 00:22:14,573
OK.

496
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:21,100
<i>Great. And I'd rather hoped the singlet
was the worst birthday surprise.

497
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:24,780
<i>Meanwhile, my mates were making the most
of finally getting into a cool party,

498
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:27,340
<i>by standing in a corridor,
not talking to anyone.

499
00:22:28,762 --> 00:22:30,220
All right? Did you find her?

500
00:22:30,918 --> 00:22:32,020
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

501
00:22:32,556 --> 00:22:35,060
- Where is she then?
- Upstairs being fucked by Patrice.

502
00:22:35,434 --> 00:22:37,217
- Knew it.
- Unlucky!

503
00:22:37,337 --> 00:22:39,101
Can you make him stop,
please, Simon?

504
00:22:39,221 --> 00:22:40,620
As a birthday present?

505
00:22:41,021 --> 00:22:43,900
Not really.
Sorry, that's just too weird.

506
00:22:44,278 --> 00:22:47,180
- Yeah. Yeah, you're probably right.
- Shall we go then?

507
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:51,467
Hi, Mark, I'm just off but
if you were looking for Charlotte,

508
00:22:51,587 --> 00:22:52,900
I think she's upstairs.

509
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:55,860
- Fuck off, you prick.
- Have a fun night!

510
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:59,076
<i>So, ironically, it was Donovan
who gave me the best gift this year,

511
00:22:59,196 --> 00:23:00,977
<i>a savagely beaten French kid.

512
00:23:01,977 --> 00:23:03,880
- What if Donovan kills him?
- Good.

513
00:23:04,138 --> 00:23:05,940
Mum'll go mental if Patrice is hurt.

514
00:23:06,242 --> 00:23:08,780
- So what, she'll get you a shitter car?
- Fair point.

515
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,019
Fuck him,

516
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:12,740
- you never see him again!
- I will stay at his at half term.

517
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,386
- You want to go to France?
- No.

518
00:23:14,506 --> 00:23:15,398
So shut up.

519
00:23:15,518 --> 00:23:19,088
What about me? It's my birthday and
I saw Patrice trying to mount Charlotte!

520
00:23:19,208 --> 00:23:21,980
- The baguette-eating dickhead frog.
- That's a bit racist.

521
00:23:22,385 --> 00:23:23,980
He's made me racist.

522
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:26,033
- Did you get to see her tits?
- No, Neil.

523
00:23:26,153 --> 00:23:28,860
Funnily, through my tear-filled eyes,
I couldn't see any tits.

524
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:31,060
- Bad luck.
- Oh, God,

525
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:33,795
what if my birthdays just
get worse and worse from now on?

526
00:23:33,915 --> 00:23:36,062
- What'll happen next year?
- You get AIDS?

527
00:23:36,182 --> 00:23:38,340
- I'd have to have sex for that.
- Or fuck a monkey.

528
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:42,260
- Technically that still counts.
- Or drink the same cup as Neil's dad.

529
00:23:42,536 --> 00:23:43,980
My dad does not have AIDS.

530
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:47,740
Your dad is so AIDS,
he's the one who gave it to monkeys.

531
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:50,180
- Take that back.
- That's what the monkeys said to him.

532
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:53,241
- Come on, let's get back to yours.
- I'll let you beat me at Pro Evo.

533
00:23:53,361 --> 00:23:54,907
You have to. I can beat you anyway.

534
00:23:55,027 --> 00:23:57,780
- Well, we'll see, won't we?
- That's them. Fucking

535
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:00,135
- Run!
- Again? Oh, good!

536
00:24:00,348 --> 00:24:02,332
- Paedos!
- Split up, he can't get us all!

537
00:24:02,452 --> 00:24:03,900
He's got a fucking cricket bat!

538
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:06,540
- Neil, go away!
- This is the tin hat.

539
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:07,867
Worst birthday ever!

540
00:24:08,118 --> 00:24:10,380
<i>So my birthday, or dog shit,
singlet, heartbreak day,

541
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:12,621
<i>as I've come to think of it,
was over.

542
00:24:12,741 --> 00:24:14,608
<i>It's fair to say
it hadn't been the best.

543
00:24:14,728 --> 00:24:16,660
<i>But I had learnt
one important life lesson.

544
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:19,681
<i>If you go round to Neil's,
don't play with his Lego.
