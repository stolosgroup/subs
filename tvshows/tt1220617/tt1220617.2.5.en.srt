The Inbetweeners 2x05
"The Duke of Edinburgh Awards"

4
00:00:21,595 --> 00:00:25,120
<i>I was no stranger to Gilbert's office.
I often popped by with a complaint</i>

5
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,623
<i>or a suggestion
on how the school could be better run.</i>

6
00:00:27,743 --> 00:00:30,149
<i>But today was different,
he'd actually invited me.</i>

7
00:00:30,566 --> 00:00:31,480
Sit down.

8
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:34,807
I'm glad to be here
because I needed to talk to you about...

9
00:00:34,927 --> 00:00:36,358
- Shut up.
- Sure.

10
00:00:36,978 --> 00:00:39,985
The headmaster has decided
it would be a good idea

11
00:00:40,105 --> 00:00:43,390
for sixth formers to participate
in the Duke of Edinburgh Awards scheme.

12
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:47,187
- I'd like you to co-ordinate it.
- Me? Really?

13
00:00:47,307 --> 00:00:49,560
Duke of Edinburgh representative
for the entire year?

14
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,773
- Yes.
- I am honoured, sir.

15
00:00:52,893 --> 00:00:54,480
Thanks very much. Why me?

16
00:00:55,612 --> 00:00:57,160
You're a virgin, aren't you?

17
00:00:57,989 --> 00:00:58,720
Sorry?

18
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,440
A virgin. You haven't had
full sexual intercourse?

19
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:03,120
No.

20
00:01:03,402 --> 00:01:05,240
Well, there's your answer.
Now get out.

21
00:01:05,907 --> 00:01:08,854
Maybe we should arrange a weekly
meeting to check on my progress.

22
00:01:08,974 --> 00:01:11,400
You can if you like,
but I won't be there.

23
00:01:11,937 --> 00:01:14,560
Or I could compose a regular memo
with how it's all going.

24
00:01:16,255 --> 00:01:19,040
- Drop that in my pigeonhole.
- Great. Where's that, sir?

25
00:01:20,162 --> 00:01:21,175
Any bin.

26
00:01:21,591 --> 00:01:24,520
Any rubbish bin you see in,
or indeed, out of the school.

27
00:01:24,944 --> 00:01:28,078
Just pop all your thoughts in a
rubbish bin, and they'll get to me.

28
00:01:29,108 --> 00:01:30,240
Bye, McKenzie.

29
00:01:30,939 --> 00:01:33,697
<i>So now I was Will McKenzie
"By Royal Appointment".</i>

30
00:01:33,817 --> 00:01:37,039
<i>But like all great leaders, I need
some idiots to use as cannon fodder.</i>

31
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:39,720
- <i>Now, where would I find some idiots?</i>
- Here, look at this.

32
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,321
Holy shit! Poor fucker's
had all his hair removed with Immac.

33
00:01:44,441 --> 00:01:45,120
What?

34
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,373
It's what birds use
to get a nice smooth fanny.

35
00:01:47,493 --> 00:01:49,166
I think my mum uses it for her legs.

36
00:01:49,286 --> 00:01:51,680
She wants to use it on her moustache
and the backs of her hands!

37
00:01:52,627 --> 00:01:55,731
- Brilliant!
- Gilbert just told me some great news.

38
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,320
School's giving free briefcases
to speccy twats?

39
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,120
- No.
- Your mum gives free blow jobs?

40
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,283
- Not about my mum.
- You've been asked to appear

41
00:02:02,403 --> 00:02:03,560
on Who's The Gayest?

42
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,878
Don't think that's even a real show.
Listen this!

43
00:02:05,998 --> 00:02:08,863
Gilbert has registered the school
for the Duke of Edinburgh Awards,

44
00:02:08,983 --> 00:02:11,720
- and I'm the co-ordinator.
- I thought you had good news?

45
00:02:12,135 --> 00:02:13,349
This is good news.

46
00:02:13,469 --> 00:02:16,640
Think how good a Duke of Edinburgh
Award will look on our UCAS forms.

47
00:02:17,247 --> 00:02:18,720
Now it sounds awesome!

48
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:22,238
Simon, trust me, this will look
great on our uni applications.

49
00:02:22,358 --> 00:02:25,784
We get to help the community and also do
some pretty incredible activities, like

50
00:02:25,904 --> 00:02:29,200
whitewater rafting, abseiling,
even mountain climbing.

51
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,880
Sounds really gay.

52
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,560
Who is this Duke of Edinburgh?
Does he teach it?

53
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,400
No, course he doesn't teach it,
you fucking idiot.

54
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,838
The Duke of Edinburgh
is Prince Charles.

55
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,080
No, he isn't. It's his dad.

56
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,291
King Philip?

57
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:46,895
I mean, that is the Duke of Edinburgh
you're thinking of but

58
00:02:47,015 --> 00:02:49,440
- he's not the king.
- He fucks the Queen, though.

59
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,600
- Probably up the arse.
- Do you want to sign up or not?

60
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,634
You've gotta be fucking joking.
There's no way

61
00:02:54,754 --> 00:02:57,000
I'm getting bummed by
some royal bloke on a mountain.

62
00:02:57,605 --> 00:02:58,520
Yes, I'm in.

63
00:02:59,317 --> 00:03:01,285
- Why, you twat?
- I've never met the Queen.

64
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,345
- I'll think about it.
- Come on!

65
00:03:04,465 --> 00:03:06,920
You can't just have
"moping after Carli" on your UCAS form.

66
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,840
- I do loads of things in my spare time.
- Masturbating doesn't count as a hobby.

67
00:03:11,623 --> 00:03:14,188
- Fuck it, go on, then.
- Great. I'll go and register us now.

68
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,529
See you Sunday!

69
00:03:15,649 --> 00:03:16,400
Sunday?

70
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:17,880
Yes, Sunday.

71
00:03:19,337 --> 00:03:20,400
My mum's barbecue?

72
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,000
- Do you remember I invite you to?
- Not really.

73
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,800
Don't worry, I'm coming. Wherever
your mum's snatch is, I'll be there.

74
00:03:27,871 --> 00:03:31,084
<i>So the good news for fans of
overcooked meat, tedious small talk</i>

75
00:03:31,204 --> 00:03:34,280
<i>and weird neighbours was
it was my mum's barbecue,</i>

76
00:03:34,649 --> 00:03:36,120
<i>and it was rocking.</i>

77
00:03:36,562 --> 00:03:37,957
This is a shit party.

78
00:03:38,191 --> 00:03:41,560
It's a middle-aged woman's barbecue.
Were you expecting the Playboy Mansion?

79
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,680
Still shit.

80
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,800
Si, I just saw your mum inside.
She looked pretty upset.

81
00:03:46,311 --> 00:03:47,680
No! Blubbing?

82
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,000
She was a bit, yeah.

83
00:03:49,472 --> 00:03:52,280
Bloody hell! She's been a total baby
since Dad moved out.

84
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,568
- Your dad's moved out?
- It's not biggy.

85
00:03:54,688 --> 00:03:56,651
It was bad lately,
so he left for a few weeks

86
00:03:56,771 --> 00:03:58,598
- while they sort stuff out.
- Like her face?

87
00:03:58,718 --> 00:04:00,649
It'll take more than weeks
to sort that mess out.

88
00:04:00,769 --> 00:04:01,886
Shut up, you cock!

89
00:04:02,006 --> 00:04:03,800
Do you maybe want to check she's OK?

90
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,627
Not really. I've had it all week.
It's so embarrassing.

91
00:04:06,915 --> 00:04:10,120
- Do you want me to get rid of her?
- No, it's fine.

92
00:04:10,744 --> 00:04:14,000
OK, I'd better go and mingle.
Don't break or steal anything.

93
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,160
We'll just go inside and get a beer.

94
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,780
- No, you are banned from going inside.
- Why?

95
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:22,260
Because you'll do something
like steal my mum's knickers

96
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,200
to sniff and then wank with.

97
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,721
- With?
- Yes, with.

98
00:04:25,841 --> 00:04:27,783
And then you'll take
great pleasure in telling me

99
00:04:27,903 --> 00:04:31,200
how you wrapped my mother's knickers
round your cock

100
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,675
and used the friction generated whilst
thinking about her tits to make you cum.

101
00:04:35,253 --> 00:04:36,376
Hello, Will.

102
00:04:37,768 --> 00:04:38,551
Hello.

103
00:04:38,671 --> 00:04:40,120
Simon, do you mind if we go?

104
00:04:40,599 --> 00:04:41,760
Bloody hell, really?

105
00:04:42,636 --> 00:04:43,970
OK! Fine!

106
00:04:47,611 --> 00:04:50,381
<i>While Simon offered his mother
a surly shoulder to cry on,</i>

107
00:04:50,501 --> 00:04:52,649
<i>I mingled
with a fellow tank top enthusiast.</i>

108
00:04:52,769 --> 00:04:54,320
Shouldn't you be revising?

109
00:04:54,771 --> 00:04:56,280
Yes. One day off won't hurt.

110
00:04:56,829 --> 00:04:58,760
It might do.
My nephew went to Center Parcs

111
00:04:58,921 --> 00:05:01,100
six weeks before his entrance exam
to Oxford.

112
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:04,080
He didn't make the cut,
decided to take a year out.

113
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,177
All his friends went to university.

114
00:05:06,297 --> 00:05:08,800
By the time they returned for
Christmas, he'd hanged himself.

115
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,053
Right.

116
00:05:12,077 --> 00:05:13,193
Thanks, Roy.

117
00:05:15,835 --> 00:05:18,680
- Sorry!
- Hello! You probably don't remember me.

118
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,237
I used to baby-sit you.

119
00:05:20,357 --> 00:05:23,514
No, course I do. You're Daisy,
Maggie's daughter.

120
00:05:24,072 --> 00:05:26,040
Nice to see you again.
You look really different.

121
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,560
You don't. I recognised your glasses
straight away and your funny walk.

122
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,920
- People still laugh at your funny walk?
- Did people laugh at my walk?

123
00:05:34,462 --> 00:05:35,179
No.

124
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,687
- A... bit.
- Great!

125
00:05:38,074 --> 00:05:41,200
Sorry, it's not that funny.
It's just... different.

126
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,920
- To a normal one?
- Yes, but who wants normal?

127
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,480
Well, me now!

128
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,080
There's a guy at uni with six toes.
Everyone loves him.

129
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,560
Right, good to know.
So what are you doing here?

130
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:52,480
Well, I was invited.

131
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,418
Yes, course.
I'm working part-time

132
00:05:54,538 --> 00:05:56,880
at the old folk's home,
thought I'd pop by.

133
00:05:57,877 --> 00:06:00,236
What an incredibly
selfless thing to do!

134
00:06:00,599 --> 00:06:01,600
Not really.

135
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,120
I'm hoping one of the rich ones
might write me into their will.

136
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,200
Sounds great.

137
00:06:06,247 --> 00:06:07,240
Amazing.

138
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,440
Well, we're always
on the lookout for volunteers.

139
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,329
Really? We're doing
a volunteering scheme at school.

140
00:06:12,449 --> 00:06:14,040
Maybe you could get us
into the home.

141
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,760
It's an old people's home.
There's not a waiting list.

142
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,200
Yes. Sorry, course.

143
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,120
So, you're still at school?

144
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,400
Technically, yes,
but I'm very mature.

145
00:06:22,753 --> 00:06:25,011
- Right, you coming?
- God. Look.

146
00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:28,200
- Sorry, I have to deal with something.
- What's happened?

147
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,120
My friends have just gone
into my house.

148
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:33,525
- It doesn't sound catastrophic.
- You don't know them.

149
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:36,000
Look, can you wait there?

150
00:06:36,798 --> 00:06:39,721
I'm off soon, but do get in touch
about the volunteering.

151
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:41,920
Now let's see that funny walk again.

152
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,800
- Really?
- For old times' sake.

153
00:06:45,735 --> 00:06:48,360
I don't really know how I do it.

154
00:06:52,895 --> 00:06:53,919
There it is!

155
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:56,520
<i>Daisy was perfect for me.</i>

156
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,840
<i>She was older, more sophisticated,
caring and best of all,</i>

157
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,648
<i>owned her own nurse's uniform.</i>

158
00:07:01,999 --> 00:07:04,600
I've got some great news.
I spent the morning setting up

159
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,104
our first D of E assignment.
It's today after school.

160
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,777
- The what?
- D of E.

161
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:10,899
It stands for "Duke of Edinburgh".

162
00:07:11,169 --> 00:07:12,760
It's what people refer to it as.

163
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,680
We need to pack?
Is it mountain climbing?

164
00:07:15,032 --> 00:07:17,360
- No.
- I hope it's whitewater rafting.

165
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,320
- Nope!
- What are we doing?

166
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,480
We're doing voluntary work
at an old people's home.

167
00:07:22,754 --> 00:07:25,720
- Up a mountain?
- No, just round the corner from school.

168
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,560
- Will, for fuck's sake!
- But Prince Charles'll be there?

169
00:07:28,894 --> 00:07:30,960
- No.
- Will, do we have to do this?

170
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,680
There are several different modules
and this is one of them, so... yes.

171
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,600
I am well glad I'm not doing it.

172
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,968
I'm glad too,
cos you always fuck things up.

173
00:07:40,088 --> 00:07:43,520
And as this is important to me,
I don't want you anywhere near it.

174
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,097
Yes, it's important for you to
spend time at an old people's home,

175
00:07:46,217 --> 00:07:47,408
because you're a paedo.

176
00:07:47,786 --> 00:07:49,955
If I did fancy old people,
which I don't,

177
00:07:50,075 --> 00:07:51,840
that would make me
the opposite of a paedo.

178
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,889
He is right.

179
00:07:53,242 --> 00:07:55,320
- Well, then, he's an OAPaedo.
- Brilliant!

180
00:07:55,741 --> 00:07:57,494
- You're desperate for a gum job.
- Am I?

181
00:07:57,614 --> 00:08:00,943
"Hello, I'm Will. Pop your teeth out,
Doris, and have a little nosh on this."

182
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:02,947
- Right. Any more?
- Yeah, give us a minute.

183
00:08:03,706 --> 00:08:05,851
Something about you needing
a queering aid.

184
00:08:05,971 --> 00:08:08,240
<i>I decided not to mention
that Daisy was the real reason,</i>

185
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,465
<i>we had to spend the next weeks
nursing the elderly,</i>

186
00:08:10,585 --> 00:08:11,919
<i>and focused on the positives.</i>

187
00:08:12,144 --> 00:08:13,088
Great guys.

188
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:16,360
Think of stories these people will have,
how much we can learn from them.

189
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,104
Is it going to be boring,
like reading?

190
00:08:20,598 --> 00:08:21,421
Fuck!

191
00:08:21,807 --> 00:08:23,865
- It don't smell great.
- Guys,

192
00:08:23,985 --> 00:08:26,311
it is such a cliche
that old people smell.

193
00:08:26,431 --> 00:08:29,212
- I thought you were better than that.
- But it does smell in here.

194
00:08:29,794 --> 00:08:32,443
In here, granted, it does smell.

195
00:08:32,563 --> 00:08:35,271
But the point is, we're here
to change things for these people.

196
00:08:35,391 --> 00:08:37,320
That's what the D of E Award's
all about.

197
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,273
Great!

198
00:08:38,472 --> 00:08:41,241
Let's skip the abseiling
and just watch this lot sleep, then!

199
00:08:41,959 --> 00:08:44,000
I promise this'll be worth it.

200
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,000
Hello!

201
00:08:46,097 --> 00:08:48,604
- Hello.
- I think I've done a poo.

202
00:08:51,035 --> 00:08:52,926
That's not good. Wait there.

203
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,280
- Thank God, Daisy.
- Hello again.

204
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,560
Great to see you.
Now, I've got a bit of a problem.

205
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,840
Is it the smell? You get used to it.

206
00:09:01,108 --> 00:09:03,160
No, I've helped an old lady
to the toilet

207
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:06,840
and now she is in and I didn't realise
the help would extend to helping her go

208
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,800
and I don't want to see her...

209
00:09:10,004 --> 00:09:11,000
You know...

210
00:09:11,573 --> 00:09:12,360
Fanny?

211
00:09:13,335 --> 00:09:15,120
- Yeah.
- You don't like fannies, then?

212
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,960
No, love them, love the fannies.

213
00:09:17,187 --> 00:09:19,600
It's just an old lady's fanny.
Not that she isn't a person.

214
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,741
It's just her fanny
is... hers and is... private.

215
00:09:23,861 --> 00:09:27,240
Why am I talking about old fannies?
Why am I talking about fannies at all?

216
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,621
- Is she there?
- Yes.

217
00:09:28,741 --> 00:09:31,362
That's fine. You get used
to the fannies. And the balls.

218
00:09:31,482 --> 00:09:34,680
They're lovely old boys here,
but, goodness, some of their balls!

219
00:09:35,394 --> 00:09:36,482
Wish me luck!

220
00:09:39,021 --> 00:09:40,120
So what do we do?

221
00:09:40,469 --> 00:09:43,360
- Just keep an eye on them, I guess.
- To make sure we don't lose any?

222
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:47,000
- They'll not try an escape, I think.
- My tortoise kept running away.

223
00:09:47,319 --> 00:09:50,040
- What has that got to do with anything?
- Well, that was old and wrinkly.

224
00:09:52,189 --> 00:09:53,480
Dead now, of course.

225
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,729
Off you go, Phyllis. Just give us
a bit more warning next time.

226
00:09:58,418 --> 00:10:01,220
- Sorry, I was a bit useless there.
- It just takes practice.

227
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:04,319
We'll soon turn you into the
Florence Nightingale of old arses.

228
00:10:04,439 --> 00:10:06,320
- How do you do it?
- Front to back.

229
00:10:07,016 --> 00:10:09,000
No, I mean dedicating your life
to helping others.

230
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,372
It's just a job.

231
00:10:10,712 --> 00:10:13,280
And I'm not feeling
particularly dedicated today.

232
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,160
- Anything I can do to help?
- No.

233
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,440
I can't get tomorrow off to go
to my friend's party.

234
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,417
Well, I'll be around tomorrow.

235
00:10:19,537 --> 00:10:22,200
And so will my friends.
We could cover for you!

236
00:10:24,034 --> 00:10:27,240
That's sweet, but I'd need cover
for the overnight shift, too.

237
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,821
I'll do that myself!
I'll stay up all night if I have to.

238
00:10:29,941 --> 00:10:30,733
Seriously?

239
00:10:31,393 --> 00:10:33,300
You shall go to the ball,
Cinderella!

240
00:10:35,133 --> 00:10:36,180
You're such a twat,

241
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:39,027
but a very sweet one. Thanks.

242
00:10:39,147 --> 00:10:41,620
- I owe you one.
- Then let me take you to dinner.

243
00:10:43,528 --> 00:10:45,208
- Dinner?
- Yes, dinner.

244
00:10:45,846 --> 00:10:47,460
Is it not old for you?

245
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:51,180
I'm mature for my age. Normally it's a
curse, but now it seems worthwhile.

246
00:10:52,092 --> 00:10:53,605
All right, go on, then.

247
00:10:53,725 --> 00:10:54,780
- Friday?
- Great.

248
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:57,740
Cool, I'll see you then.
Thanks again, toy boy!

249
00:10:58,428 --> 00:11:01,801
<i>Yes! I'd done it. My ex-baby-sitter
had agreed to go out with me,</i>

250
00:11:01,921 --> 00:11:03,340
<i>and all I had to do was ask her.</i>

251
00:11:03,943 --> 00:11:07,259
<i>And pretend my mates were happy
to spend time to bathe geriatrics.</i>

252
00:11:07,379 --> 00:11:09,417
So, how was your evening
with the zombies, then?

253
00:11:09,537 --> 00:11:11,140
Creepy. Glad I'm not going back.

254
00:11:11,764 --> 00:11:12,500
What?

255
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,691
- Sorry, I can't do it any more.
- What do you mean?

256
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,180
You've got to cover
an extra shift tonight.

257
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,660
You can't do this to me!

258
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,363
I've got to go and see my dad.

259
00:11:20,483 --> 00:11:23,380
Now he's moved out, apparently
I've got to spend time with him.

260
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:24,703
It's such a wind-up.

261
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,988
Fuck! This is a fucking disaster!

262
00:11:28,108 --> 00:11:30,220
I promised Daisy
the three of us would cover her.

263
00:11:30,733 --> 00:11:32,764
There's a bird involved.
Now I get it.

264
00:11:32,884 --> 00:11:35,134
Oh, God! I can't let her down.

265
00:11:35,254 --> 00:11:37,750
She's agreed to go to dinner with me
to say thanks for covering.

266
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:38,634
Dinner!

267
00:11:38,754 --> 00:11:40,584
- Maybe she won't mind.
- Course she'll mind!

268
00:11:40,704 --> 00:11:42,740
She's only going
cos he's doing her a favour.

269
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,060
It's tragic.

270
00:11:44,365 --> 00:11:45,900
- God!
- Jay, why don't you cover?

271
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:48,620
- Fuck off. I've got things to do.
- What did you do last night, then?

272
00:11:49,113 --> 00:11:51,620
- Went down the park.
- The park? Did you play on the swings?

273
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:55,066
At least I don't have to wipe old
arse for the next three months

274
00:11:55,186 --> 00:11:56,980
just to get a Duke of Spastic Award.

275
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:59,780
Come on, Jay. Just think of it
as doing me a huge favour.

276
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,300
Why would I do you a favour?

277
00:12:01,557 --> 00:12:03,980
- For money?
- I would do it for money. How much?

278
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,940
It's Neil's idea. I'm not going
to pay you to do voluntary work.

279
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,740
- 30 quid and I'll do it.
- 40.

280
00:12:09,616 --> 00:12:12,020
If you get this nurse bird to
nosh you off, then it's a bargain.

281
00:12:12,518 --> 00:12:14,980
You really are a vile human being.

282
00:12:16,379 --> 00:12:17,540
- Tenner?
- 20.

283
00:12:18,243 --> 00:12:20,460
- God. All right, then, done.
- Yep.

284
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:22,998
<i>Sometimes, you just have to
dance with the devil...</i>

285
00:12:23,118 --> 00:12:24,940
<i>or do voluntary work
with a sex pest.</i>

286
00:12:28,051 --> 00:12:30,616
<i>Without doubt, the worst thing
about your dad leaving home</i>

287
00:12:30,736 --> 00:12:33,152
<i>is having to eat at places like
Little Chef and the Big Steakhouse</i>

288
00:12:33,272 --> 00:12:34,700
<i>while he tries to bond with you.</i>

289
00:12:35,425 --> 00:12:37,500
Look,
I know this stuff with your mum

290
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:40,020
is tough for you guys.
You've probably got a lot of questions.

291
00:12:42,403 --> 00:12:45,300
- Can I get a new car?
- Then I want a new computer.

292
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:49,340
- You had a new computer last year.
- You got a new car six months ago.

293
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,740
Yeah, but it's shit.

294
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:53,180
Boys. I meant questions
about your mum and me.

295
00:12:55,144 --> 00:12:56,626
Not really. Can I go now?

296
00:12:57,749 --> 00:12:59,241
It's been really good to see you.

297
00:12:59,808 --> 00:13:03,260
I'm sorry to dump on you like this, but
I've not got anyone else to talk to.

298
00:13:03,421 --> 00:13:05,432
- It's OK, Dad, I understand.
- It's just...

299
00:13:05,814 --> 00:13:08,380
Things are complicated with your mum
and me, not just sexually.

300
00:13:09,139 --> 00:13:11,518
- It's getting late now, Dad.
- She had a huge appetite for it.

301
00:13:12,547 --> 00:13:13,568
- Huge!
- Please,

302
00:13:13,688 --> 00:13:15,849
- Don't, please...
- I wish I could stop my urges,

303
00:13:15,969 --> 00:13:17,064
problem solved.

304
00:13:17,417 --> 00:13:19,728
But I'm a very sexual person.
Always have been.

305
00:13:20,413 --> 00:13:22,780
- Is it the same for you?
- I'd better get going.

306
00:13:23,924 --> 00:13:24,849
Yeah, OK.

307
00:13:26,888 --> 00:13:27,740
Dad...

308
00:13:28,672 --> 00:13:30,260
Everything is going to be OK, right?

309
00:13:30,555 --> 00:13:31,670
I hope so.

310
00:13:32,064 --> 00:13:34,983
Look, maybe at the weekend
we can have a look around some car lots,

311
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:37,100
see if we can't get an upgrade
on the yellow peril.

312
00:13:37,703 --> 00:13:39,100
Thanks. That'd be brilliant.

313
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:43,095
One more thing.
Can I borrow your laptop for a few days?

314
00:13:43,215 --> 00:13:46,980
The movie channels in here are a little
bit soft, if you get what I mean.

315
00:13:47,597 --> 00:13:50,113
<i>So while Simon was struggling
to keep his mixed grill down,</i>

316
00:13:50,233 --> 00:13:52,562
<i>in his place I had Jay
helping me out at the home.</i>

317
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:54,672
Lucky me.

318
00:13:57,638 --> 00:13:59,019
Careful, you'll wake Brian.

319
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:02,300
Fucking hell! If you love Brian's old
cock so much, why don't you marry him?

320
00:14:04,233 --> 00:14:05,341
This is boring.

321
00:14:05,921 --> 00:14:07,740
- I'm going for a quick tug.
- What, in here?

322
00:14:07,908 --> 00:14:10,540
Nah. There must be a spare room
around here somewhere.

323
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,340
There's a bedroom free if you want.

324
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,780
- Perfect.
- Someone died in it. It may be haunted?

325
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:18,579
I don't know, but it'll be covered
in ectoplasm when I'm finished.

326
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:21,580
- Cos of the ghosts?
- No, cos I'll spunk all over it!

327
00:14:22,138 --> 00:14:24,180
The problem pages in these
are wanking gold.

328
00:14:24,967 --> 00:14:26,013
See you later, mug!

329
00:14:26,133 --> 00:14:28,358
<i>My plan to impress Daisy
was working,</i>

330
00:14:28,478 --> 00:14:30,942
<i>apart from Jay masturbating
into a resident's sink</i>

331
00:14:31,062 --> 00:14:33,300
<i>and me being so knackered
from covering the overnight shift</i>

332
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:36,243
<i>that I fell asleep at school,
never a good idea.</i>

333
00:14:36,363 --> 00:14:37,378
Here he is.

334
00:14:37,907 --> 00:14:38,900
Sleeping Ugly.

335
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,028
Get any grey minge last night, eh?

336
00:14:41,787 --> 00:14:43,739
I know
why you was really there overnight.

337
00:14:43,859 --> 00:14:45,700
You got a geriatric girlfriend,
didn't you?

338
00:14:45,998 --> 00:14:48,820
I bet you creep into her room,
kiss her on the false teeth

339
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:51,300
and then slide right up inside
her powdery old fanny.

340
00:14:54,164 --> 00:14:55,456
He's asleep, I reckon.

341
00:14:58,676 --> 00:14:59,624
Oh, my God!

342
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,619
I don't believe it. It's perfect.

343
00:15:02,885 --> 00:15:04,011
What you got there?

344
00:15:04,131 --> 00:15:06,614
Hair-removal cream,
like in them photos.

345
00:15:07,027 --> 00:15:09,501
I nicked it from Sadie Cunningham's
bag during registration.

346
00:15:09,827 --> 00:15:12,100
Her bush'll go out of control,
but this'll be well worth it.

347
00:15:12,848 --> 00:15:14,340
- No way!
- Give us a hand, Neil.

348
00:15:16,171 --> 00:15:17,587
Shouldn't need too much.

349
00:15:18,153 --> 00:15:21,300
He's probably only got four pubes
and he pisses through one of them.

350
00:15:27,893 --> 00:15:30,631
<i>So, unbeknownst to me,
I'd been robbed of my pubic hairs.</i>

351
00:15:30,751 --> 00:15:34,620
<i>The date with Daisy was few hours away
and I had alopecia of the ball bag.</i>

352
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:36,959
<i>Terrifyingly,
Simon was my only hope.</i>

353
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:38,860
This story with my dad
is doing my head in.

354
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,860
I know mate, but it'll get better.

355
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:43,340
I bloody hope so.
Christ, he's boring!

356
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,460
He keeps trying to talk to me
man to man. I can't bear it.

357
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,871
We still need help
at the old people's home if you want.

358
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:51,380
Anything, so I don't have to hear
about my parents' sex life.

359
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:52,854
- Is that a yes?
- Yes!

360
00:15:52,974 --> 00:15:55,620
Can I have my shitty
voluntary job back, please?

361
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,940
Great. I get to sack Jay.
That'll be good.

362
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:01,112
Are you sure you're OK
about your mum and dad?

363
00:16:01,551 --> 00:16:03,380
Yeah, yeah. They'll sort it out.

364
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,820
Well, I just want you to know
I'm here for you.

365
00:16:06,196 --> 00:16:08,081
- Thanks, mate.
- Just like I know

366
00:16:08,201 --> 00:16:10,700
that you're there for me
if I need you.

367
00:16:11,033 --> 00:16:13,220
- Yeah, course.
- Good, cos I need you to do something.

368
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,380
- OK. What is it?
- Have a look at my cock.

369
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,460
Not in a gay way.
Something's gone wrong.

370
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:22,700
I think looking at your cock at all
is a bit gay.

371
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:25,620
Please, I'm serious.
All my pubes have fallen out.

372
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:27,470
- What?
- I was asleep at school

373
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:30,140
and must have had a wet dream
cos it was all sticky...

374
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,669
- You spunked in the common room?
- Yes, but listen!

375
00:16:32,945 --> 00:16:36,490
I went home to clean up and all
my pubes came off in the shower.

376
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:38,645
Sorry, you spunked your pants

377
00:16:38,765 --> 00:16:41,091
in the common room during the day,

378
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:43,580
- when there were people around?
- Yes.

379
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,420
- And then your pubes fell out?
- Yes!

380
00:16:45,763 --> 00:16:48,093
- This is way out of my league.
- Just look.

381
00:16:48,213 --> 00:16:50,756
Normally, it wouldn't matter,
but I've got that date with Daisy.

382
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:52,460
What if she wants more than a snog?

383
00:16:52,757 --> 00:16:55,100
Even a snog's unlikely,
no offence, but go on.

384
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:57,871
Well, if the miracle does happen
and she touches or, worse,

385
00:16:57,991 --> 00:17:00,940
sees the bald old fella,
what's she going to think?

386
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,954
- That you're a porn star?
- Look at me.

387
00:17:03,218 --> 00:17:05,780
I don't think she's gonna
think I'm a porn star.

388
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:08,100
Maybe you could draw some pubes on
with a marker pen.

389
00:17:08,926 --> 00:17:12,769
OK, good idea. And after that, maybe
I'll draw a six-pack on my stomach!

390
00:17:12,889 --> 00:17:15,580
- Or a longer cock!
- Or wearing a wig down there?

391
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,979
Good idea! A cock wig!

392
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:22,020
What sort of idea is that?!
Fucking wig!

393
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,699
If you don't want my help, I'll go.

394
00:17:23,859 --> 00:17:27,540
I'm sorry if I seem a little stressed.
It's just I've got no fucking pubes!

395
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:31,630
Sorry, Simon, I do want your help.

396
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:33,780
- Please look at my cock.
- No!

397
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,860
<i>Simon was useless,
and soon it was time for my date.</i>

398
00:17:38,454 --> 00:17:41,700
<i>Despite my alarming lack of pubes,
I tried to put on a brave face.</i>

399
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:44,940
You look nice. I'm just going to
wash my hands, then we'll go.

400
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,220
- Yeah. Great.
- I'll meet you outside.

401
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:48,325
Fantastic.

402
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,860
<i>It may have been a rush of blood
to my head,</i>

403
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,924
<i>or maybe the slight chill
around my balls,</i>

404
00:17:56,044 --> 00:17:58,780
<i>but suddenly Simon's cock-wig advice
seemed my best shot.</i>

405
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,740
- You ready?
- Yeah, sure am.

406
00:18:02,298 --> 00:18:04,706
<i>It was itchy,
but I kind of liked it.</i>

407
00:18:05,526 --> 00:18:08,348
I cannot believe that plum Will
is gonna pay me for yesterday

408
00:18:08,468 --> 00:18:11,140
when all I did was watch TV
and slope off for a crafty wank.

409
00:18:11,414 --> 00:18:14,180
I'm being paid to wank.
It's my perfect job.

410
00:18:14,704 --> 00:18:17,340
And tomorrow,
I get 20 quid to do it all over again.

411
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,912
You go to an old people's home
and wank off?

412
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:21,420
Doesn't that seem weird to you?

413
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,791
Sometimes I even slip a finger
up my arse while doing it.

414
00:18:24,816 --> 00:18:27,820
Well, I'm going back tomorrow, you need
to find somewhere else to bash one out.

415
00:18:28,263 --> 00:18:31,860
No, I'll still be there.
Easiest money I've ever earned.

416
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:34,532
- He won't pay if you are useless.
- Yes, he will.

417
00:18:35,054 --> 00:18:36,674
He's got to give me notice.

418
00:18:36,794 --> 00:18:39,940
I'm a paid voluntary worker.
I've got rights.

419
00:18:40,505 --> 00:18:43,020
- Hi, Simon.
- Dad? What are you doing here?

420
00:18:43,412 --> 00:18:45,420
Me and your mum are just
talking things through.

421
00:18:46,244 --> 00:18:50,060
Oh, great. That's great.
Yeah, listen, you got any johnnies?

422
00:18:51,141 --> 00:18:54,284
<i>So while Simon's parents
had noisy, unprotected sex,</i>

423
00:18:54,404 --> 00:18:56,714
<i>my dinner date was going well,</i>

424
00:18:56,834 --> 00:18:59,140
<i>considering I had
a pensioner's wig in my pants.</i>

425
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,420
Did I just drink a whole bottle
of Pinot Grigio?

426
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:03,580
I wasn't keeping score,
but it looked like that.

427
00:19:04,233 --> 00:19:06,958
God. And I only really came
to dinner to say thank you

428
00:19:07,078 --> 00:19:09,448
- for doing my shift the last time.
- My pleasure. It was easy.

429
00:19:09,568 --> 00:19:12,340
It was as quiet as the place
directly before the grave.

430
00:19:13,674 --> 00:19:15,325
- You're funny.
- I try.

431
00:19:15,815 --> 00:19:18,340
- No, I really do try.
- God, come here.

432
00:19:25,379 --> 00:19:28,060
- Nice.
- What am I doing? You're so young.

433
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:30,210
Yes, I am, but...

434
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:33,420
No, for God's sake, don't talk.
Just come back with me.

435
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:37,142
I can't believe I'm doing this.
I'm going to blame the white wine.

436
00:19:37,262 --> 00:19:40,027
<i>This was amazing. And although,
in her role as a nurse,</i>

437
00:19:40,147 --> 00:19:42,803
<i>I was sure Daisy had seen genitalia
much more horrific than mine,</i>

438
00:19:42,923 --> 00:19:45,813
<i>she probably hadn't seen someone
with a wig stuffed down there.</i>

439
00:19:45,933 --> 00:19:49,022
<i>So after 17 years of trying
to get girls to touch my penis,</i>

440
00:19:49,142 --> 00:19:51,326
<i>I was now doing everything
I could to prevent it.</i>

441

-== [ www.OpenSubtitles.com ] ==-

442
00:20:08,055 --> 00:20:10,427
- What the fuck is this?
- Daisy, I'm sorry.

443
00:20:10,547 --> 00:20:12,558
- Please let me explain.
- Is it a wig?

444
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,469
It's a long story,

445
00:20:14,589 --> 00:20:18,140
but I've just not got
any hair down there.

446
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:22,980
No. No, of course you haven't.

447
00:20:23,501 --> 00:20:24,860
I forget how young you are.

448
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:27,145
I shouldn't be doing this.
You're a child!

449
00:20:27,265 --> 00:20:29,940
No, no, no, it's not that.
I have had hair...

450
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,860
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.
I know you're not ready,

451
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,955
you should be allowed to mature
at your own pace.

452
00:20:35,075 --> 00:20:38,068
Look, forget about the hair!
It still works.

453
00:20:38,188 --> 00:20:39,820
Touch it. You might like it.

454
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:41,548
I'm sorry.

455
00:20:42,161 --> 00:20:43,660
Is this Phyllis's wig?

456
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:49,372
<i>So my stupid, hairless gonads
had ruined it for me.</i>

457
00:20:49,492 --> 00:20:52,740
<i>And even worse, we still had two
weeks' tedious voluntary work left.</i>

458
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,580
Why stay here?
You're not pay for it.

459
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:56,780
I like them.
They're like people, too.

460
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:59,350
- You fancy them, is what you mean.
- No, it's just

461
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:01,100
people like Brian, they've lived.

462
00:21:01,667 --> 00:21:03,571
- I think they're boring.
- Yeah,

463
00:21:03,691 --> 00:21:05,460
but it's a different boring,
you know?

464
00:21:06,238 --> 00:21:06,952
No.

465
00:21:08,461 --> 00:21:10,860
- Right, I think it's about that time.
- What, again?

466
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:14,140
With as much spunk as I have,
you need to release the valve.

467
00:21:14,521 --> 00:21:16,278
I've got it down to about
30 seconds now.

468
00:21:16,687 --> 00:21:19,100
- You want a copy of Hello!?
- No, I've done that cover to cover.

469
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:21,022
I need some new material.

470
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:23,849
I even had to have a wank
over Fern Britton the other day.

471
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,820
If you see Baldy Bollocks,
cover for us.

472
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:30,420
Daisy, listen, I just wanted to try
and clear the air about last night.

473
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:33,780
I'm sorry, I'm too embarrassed.
I've got to sort out a new resident.

474
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:35,540
I don't know what happened.

475
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,470
I used to have loads of hair
down there.

476
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:41,383
It went all over my balls, and I've
still got loads in my arse crack!

477
00:21:42,139 --> 00:21:45,675
Will, sometimes it's better
just not to say anything.

478
00:21:48,518 --> 00:21:50,350
<i>So while I was
flogging a dead horse,</i>

479
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:52,551
<i>Jay was thinking about
flogging something else,</i>

480
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:55,806
<i>and in his never-ending quest
for fresh material,</i>

481
00:21:55,926 --> 00:21:57,247
<i>he plumbed new depths.</i>

482
00:22:19,557 --> 00:22:21,620
Hello! Who's that?

483
00:22:22,803 --> 00:22:23,552
God!

484
00:22:25,849 --> 00:22:26,780
I'm so sorry.

485
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:29,140
Don't worry, love.
I've seen it all before.

486
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:31,940
- I thought it was empty.
- Your mum's settling in OK.

487
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:35,586
This is Jay. He's helping out
as part of Duke of Edinburgh.

488
00:22:35,706 --> 00:22:37,580
How nice.
Thanks for looking after Mum.

489
00:22:42,498 --> 00:22:44,380
He did that looking at me.

490
00:22:47,393 --> 00:22:49,938
- Thanks a bunch, Jay. Nice job!
- I didn't do nothing.

491
00:22:50,058 --> 00:22:53,094
- Really? Didn't sound like nothing.
- It was a misunderstanding.

492
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,151
I don't know why you're being
so fucking menstrual.

493
00:22:56,271 --> 00:22:57,912
Maybe I'm being a bit menstrual

494
00:22:58,032 --> 00:23:00,252
cos not only have you got us
chucked off Duke of Edinburgh,

495
00:23:00,372 --> 00:23:02,340
but you've also blown it for me
with a sexy woman.

496
00:23:02,682 --> 00:23:05,380
- And that was my fault, was it?
- Yes, it was.

497
00:23:06,025 --> 00:23:09,420
- How?
- You wanked at an old lady!

498
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:12,380
And putting a wig down your pants
had nothing to do with it?

499
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:15,540
- That was a terrible idea, mate.
- That was your idea!

500
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:16,436
A wig?

501
00:23:16,556 --> 00:23:20,025
- What were you thinking?
- Maybe "What am I going to do?

502
00:23:20,145 --> 00:23:24,180
"My pubes have fallen out cos my friends
got the idea to put hair-remover on it!"

503
00:23:24,456 --> 00:23:27,666
- And it was.
- At least Daisy touched your cock.

504
00:23:28,255 --> 00:23:30,311
No. She couldn't get her hand
through the lining.

505
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:32,900
You still owe me 40 quid
for those two shifts.

506
00:23:33,158 --> 00:23:35,580
I think you may be waiting a while
for that payment.

507
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:36,740
We shook on it!

508
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:39,474
Yes, well, we all know what happens
when you shake on things.

509
00:23:45,613 --> 00:23:48,308
<i>They say every defeat
is a victory if you learn from it.</i>

510
00:23:48,428 --> 00:23:51,380
<i>Not this one. It had simply been
a credibility-crushing...</i>

511
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:52,660
<i>You're a virgin?</i>

512
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:53,980
<i>... pube-losing,</i>

513
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:56,020
<i>granny-wanking royal disaster.</i>

514
00:23:57,044 --> 00:23:59,048
Is Prince Charles
cross with us, sir?

515
00:24:00,305 --> 00:25:00,383
