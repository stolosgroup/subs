1
00:00:05,021 --> 00:00:07,524
John gotti.
Life in prison.

2
00:00:07,891 --> 00:00:10,393
No chance of parole.

3
00:00:10,393 --> 00:00:12,896
We've seen arrests
and prosecutions...

4
00:00:12,896 --> 00:00:16,399
in florida and elsewhere
of top mob figures.

5
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:19,402
What are you doin'?
Put that back.

6
00:00:19,402 --> 00:00:23,907
- What's the situation
on the ground today,

7
00:00:24,407 --> 00:00:26,409
right now, in the mob?

8
00:00:26,409 --> 00:00:30,663
Confusion, instability,
vacuum at the top.

9
00:00:30,663 --> 00:00:33,666
What caused the decline?
Your sister's ass.

10
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:38,805
An aggressive government policy
over two decades
to behead the crime families.

11
00:00:38,805 --> 00:00:41,307
But wasn't it,
at least in part,

12
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:44,811
a disregard
within the mob itself...

13
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:49,065
of the rules
that served the old dons
so well?

14
00:00:49,065 --> 00:00:51,067
The shoe fits.
Oh, no doubt.

15
00:00:51,568 --> 00:00:55,071
So, cheer me up,
babe.

16
00:00:55,071 --> 00:00:59,576
Just when i thought i was out,
they pull me back in.

17
00:00:59,576 --> 00:01:02,579
Huh? Is that pacino
or is that pacino?

18
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:05,582
- Fuckin' spittin' image.
- Vincent rizzo.
- Yes.

19
00:01:05,949 --> 00:01:08,451
Former soldier
in the genovese family.

20
00:01:08,451 --> 00:01:11,704
Government witness
turned best- selling author.

21
00:01:11,704 --> 00:01:15,842
- Do you agree
with u. S. Attorney braun?
- The party's over.

22
00:01:15,842 --> 00:01:17,844
He is a wiseguy.
Please elaborate.

23
00:01:18,344 --> 00:01:20,346
It's not like it was.
Cloning.

24
00:01:20,346 --> 00:01:23,349
- Mexicans are huge in that.
- Fascinating, gotta admit it.

25
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:26,352
'Cause they work
as parking valets.

26
00:01:26,352 --> 00:01:30,723
Do i mean that organized crime
is just gonna pack its bags
voluntarily...

27
00:01:30,723 --> 00:01:32,725
and go the way
of the dodo bird?

28
00:01:33,109 --> 00:01:36,112
Vincent, they're not
going the way of the dodo bird--
what you talkin' about?

29
00:01:36,613 --> 00:01:38,615
- Mexicans.
- What about them?

30
00:01:39,115 --> 00:01:42,118
- Cell phones.
- I'm not talkin'
about clonin' cell phones.

31
00:01:42,619 --> 00:01:45,622
Jesus. I'm talkin'
about fuckin' sheep, science.

32
00:01:45,622 --> 00:01:49,125
I tell my kids,
"only god can make a life."

33
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:52,128
Guy here asks,"what if
they had cloned princess di?"

34
00:01:52,495 --> 00:01:58,001
But, you know, the heyday,
the golden age or whatever
of the mob?

35
00:01:58,134 --> 00:02:01,137
That's gone,
and that's never comin' back.

36
00:02:01,137 --> 00:02:04,641
And they have only themselves
to blame.

37
00:02:04,641 --> 00:02:08,144
Ah, va a napoli.
They pay thischiacchierone
by the word?

38
00:02:08,511 --> 00:02:10,647
- I think
it's drug trafficking.
- Oh!

39
00:02:11,147 --> 00:02:15,401
I think that ruined everything.
You're lookin' at
a mandatory 35 to life...

40
00:02:15,518 --> 00:02:19,272
in prison, and guys started
to rat on each other just so
they could avoid prosecution.

41
00:02:19,772 --> 00:02:22,408
What's goin' on with
that princess di thing?

42
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:25,912
Do you think the royal family
had her whacked?

43
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:28,915
Last time i take a fuckin' limo
in paris.

44
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:32,535
- Like you were
ever in paris, paulie.
- I went over for a blow job.

45
00:02:32,535 --> 00:02:36,539
Your mother was
working the bonbon concession
at the eiffel tower.

46
00:02:36,539 --> 00:02:40,543
So, did you hear what
i told him? I told him
i went over for a blow job.

47
00:02:40,543 --> 00:02:43,546
"Your mother was
workin' the bonbon concession
at the eiffel tower."

48
00:02:44,047 --> 00:02:46,549
Got a list of people
long as my leg
i wouldn't want cloned.

49
00:02:46,683 --> 00:02:49,185
The fuckin' mayor of new york,
that's the guy least likely
to get cloned.

50
00:02:49,185 --> 00:02:52,055
So, the code of silence
or theomerta...

51
00:02:52,055 --> 00:02:55,441
or whatever you wanna call it
just went by the boards.

52
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:59,062
You're always
gonna have organized crime,
always.

53
00:02:59,562 --> 00:03:02,065
As long as the human being
has certain appetites...

54
00:03:02,065 --> 00:03:06,069
for gambling, pornography
or whatever,

55
00:03:06,069 --> 00:03:09,072
someone's always gonna surface
to serve these needs.

56
00:03:09,572 --> 00:03:14,577
Always.
Just when i thought i was out,
they pull me back in.

57
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,074
OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN
from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn

58
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:08,908
- You got dvd players
in back?

59
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:12,412
Don't hurt me, man.
Only people get hurt, the ones
who try to be fuckin' jerk- offs.

60
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:16,165
Okay? Now, step down,
nice and easy. Come on.
Move it.

61
00:05:16,165 --> 00:05:18,167
Come on.
He's got the dvd players.

62
00:05:18,167 --> 00:05:22,171
Hey, quick and painless.
Nobody wants to hurt your ass.
Okay, but you gotta tie me up.

63
00:05:22,171 --> 00:05:25,174
You gonna be a jerk- off now?
My boss is gonna think
i'm in on it.

64
00:05:25,174 --> 00:05:27,293
What? Do we look like
we're tryin' for a merit badge?

65
00:05:27,293 --> 00:05:31,798
- We travel around with rope?
- I've got some in the cab.
Please. I need this job.

66
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:34,801
- Jesus christ. Get a rope.
- I don't know who in
the company gave up the route,

67
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:38,805
but there's no way
i could walk away unscathed
without being fired.

68
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:41,808
- You wanna be scathed?
- Yeah, so it looks like
i didn't give up...

69
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:44,444
without a struggle.

70
00:05:47,947 --> 00:05:51,451
- Oh!
- That's cool.
Thank you, man.

71
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:55,455
- That- that's enough.
- No. Wait.

72
00:05:57,457 --> 00:05:59,959
Cool. That's cool.

73
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:02,962
Scathed? Scathed.
Scathed.

74
00:06:07,417 --> 00:06:10,420
Mr. Miller,
my science teacher,
he got his car stolen.

75
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,922
You're kidding.
From where? His house?

76
00:06:12,922 --> 00:06:14,924
Mm- mmm. Right
from his parking spot
at school.

77
00:06:15,425 --> 00:06:18,428
A saturn. He only
had it, like, a year.

78
00:06:18,428 --> 00:06:20,430
The security people
at the school are a joke.

79
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:24,934
Did you hear
what anthony jr. Just said?
Mr. Miller's car got stolen.

80
00:06:25,068 --> 00:06:27,570
Refresh my memory.
Who's he again?

81
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:30,073
Your son's science teacher?

82
00:06:33,076 --> 00:06:36,579
- You're up early, dad.
- He just bought that car
a year ago.

83
00:06:36,946 --> 00:06:40,450
- So? Insurance'll pay.
- Yeah, but they don't
give full value.

84
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,202
These poor teachers,
they don't make a lot.

85
00:06:43,202 --> 00:06:46,205
So he can work
a summer vacation.
Yeah.

86
00:06:46,589 --> 00:06:49,342
- Maybe you could help find it.
- Funny.

87
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:52,345
I thought i told you
i changed my name from lojack
to anthony soprano.

88
00:06:52,462 --> 00:06:55,965
Laugh. I thought i'd pee
my pants. Seriously, though,
pussy's got the body shop.

89
00:06:55,965 --> 00:06:59,102
- He couldn't ask around?
-
i'm late.

90
00:06:59,102 --> 00:07:02,605
What are you
getting in science?
D+.

91
00:07:02,605 --> 00:07:05,108
See what i can do.

92
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:08,728
That's not what i meant.
He's gotta work for his grades.

93
00:07:19,989 --> 00:07:22,492
I'm going
back to bed.
Bye, dad.

94
00:07:22,492 --> 00:07:25,378
See you later.

95
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:28,247
Here. Eat this.

96
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:38,758
Technology comes
to the bing!

97
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:40,760
Hey, christopher,
where you been?

98
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,262
Come on.
Come on.
Let's go.

99
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:46,766
Hey. Is the load here?
- Yeah.

100
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:51,270
Georgie,
if a guy named serge calls,
you tell him i'll be right back.

101
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:53,773
Ton',
these new phone systems--
hold, conference--

102
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:57,660
- sometimes i get confused.
- How complicated is it?

103
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,662
You answer the phone;
you take the fuckin' message.

104
00:07:59,662 --> 00:08:04,033
The voice mail only comes on
if you let the phone ring.
Jesus christ, georgie.

105
00:08:12,925 --> 00:08:16,679
- I hear there's not as many
titles available as on laser.
- There's more comin', though.

106
00:08:16,679 --> 00:08:19,682
My internist told me
the picture's not that different
from the laser either, ton'.

107
00:08:19,682 --> 00:08:22,185
But the sound?
Way improved.

108
00:08:22,185 --> 00:08:24,687
Good.
'Cause nothin' beats...

109
00:08:24,687 --> 00:08:27,690
poppin' up
some orville redenbacher's
and listenin' tomen in black.

110
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:30,193
All right. Fuck it.
Hey. No, no. It's the
goddamn wires, that's all.

111
00:08:30,193 --> 00:08:33,196
I'll be glad to hook it up,
ton'. You know, i used
to be an installer.

112
00:08:38,067 --> 00:08:42,572
Why can't you
be nice to brendan?
We discussed that.

113
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:48,711
Ton', i was just gonna
come lookin'. It's
the guy...for you.

114
00:08:48,711 --> 00:08:51,214
Serge?
I'll take it over there.

115
00:08:58,221 --> 00:08:59,722
Serge?

116
00:09:02,225 --> 00:09:05,228
You press "hold"
when you transfer a call.

117
00:09:05,344 --> 00:09:07,980
I'm sorry, tony.

118
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:16,606
- Now he's not gonna call back.
- Brend's a good earner, t.
This jack was his plan.

119
00:09:16,606 --> 00:09:20,109
Yeah, he's a good kid, but i
don't like that methamphetamine.

120
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:24,997
Fuck. I gotta
call my mother.

121
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:33,873
Hello?
Hello? Ma?

122
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:37,376
Ah, look who calls!

123
00:09:37,376 --> 00:09:40,379
How you doin'?
I was wonderin' when
you were gonna call.

124
00:09:40,763 --> 00:09:44,267
Well, you can stop
wonderin' now. This is it.
I'm callin' ya.

125
00:09:44,267 --> 00:09:47,770
Uh, i called you yesterday,
remember? You were supposed
to call me back?

126
00:09:48,271 --> 00:09:52,775
I phoned your house.
Some operator
answered the phone.

127
00:09:52,775 --> 00:09:54,777
I couldn't understand
a word she was saying.

128
00:09:55,144 --> 00:09:56,646
Ma, how many times
i gotta tell ya?
That's not an operator.

129
00:09:57,146 --> 00:10:01,033
That's an answering machine.
Oh, fancy, fancy.

130
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:04,537
Here. Let me turn the heat off
under these mushrooms.

131
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:12,545
You and my mother,
you're like two peas in a pod.

132
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:16,666
She can't master the phone
either, but she's 70 years old.
What's your fuckin' excuse?

133
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:26,425
What is she doin' now?

134
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:35,935
Oh, my god.

135
00:10:36,435 --> 00:10:39,438
Oh, my god!
Ma.

136
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,442
Ma?

137
00:10:44,443 --> 00:10:47,947
Hey, ma!

138
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:52,952
Oh, my god!
Ma?

139
00:10:53,452 --> 00:10:56,339
Where the hell is she?
Who is this?

140
00:10:56,339 --> 00:10:59,842
It's anthony.
The mushrooms--
they're on fire.

141
00:11:00,209 --> 00:11:02,461
All right, ma. Get
the fire extinguisher under
the sink, the one i gave you.

142
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:06,215
- Get it.
- Oh, my god! The wall's
gettin' all black!

143
00:11:06,465 --> 00:11:08,467
All right, ma.
Hang up and call 911.

144
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:10,469
Ton', the guy's
on the second line.

145
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:13,606
Aren't you coming over?
Press "hold," goddamn it!

146
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:15,975
Listen, ma.
I can't come over.
I'm 40 minutes away.

147
00:11:16,475 --> 00:11:19,478
You hang up, call 911
and leave the house.

148
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:22,114
Look at how i live.

149
00:11:22,481 --> 00:11:25,484
Ma, hang up
and call 911.

150
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:34,994
Hello?
Carmela, my mother's
got a fire in the kitchen.

151
00:11:35,244 --> 00:11:38,247
Oh, my god.
She's callin' 911.
Can you get over there?

152
00:11:38,247 --> 00:11:41,884
Yeah. I'm on my way.
Thank you, baby.
I know you're busy.

153
00:11:41,884 --> 00:11:46,005
Serge. Serge? Listen.
I can't talk to you
right now.

154
00:11:46,389 --> 00:11:49,392
I gotta go
to an outside line.
Give me your number.

155
00:11:50,893 --> 00:11:53,646
All right. All right.
I'll call you back.

156
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:57,400
Is your mom okay?
This shit cannot go on
like this.

157
00:11:58,901 --> 00:12:02,905
Hey, t. Hey, t.
This teacher--
they stole his car.

158
00:12:02,905 --> 00:12:07,910
You got a plate number?
Call my wife.

159
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:14,667
Have a nice day, ma'am.
Thanks, fellas.

160
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:17,169
No problem.

161
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:25,678
Ma,

162
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:29,181
i wish you would let me
get somebody in here
to help you.

163
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:32,685
You shouldn't be alone.
Help me what?

164
00:12:34,186 --> 00:12:38,307
- With the housework.
- I have my ways.

165
00:12:38,307 --> 00:12:41,310
A stranger could care less
about doing it right.

166
00:12:41,444 --> 00:12:45,948
Can i tell you something,
though, ma?
You need company.

167
00:12:45,948 --> 00:12:49,952
Now, don't start with that
nursing home business again.

168
00:12:49,952 --> 00:12:53,456
This is not a nursing home.
It is a retirement community.

169
00:13:00,463 --> 00:13:03,833
You want me to make you
a littlepastin, put a little
something in your stomach?

170
00:13:08,337 --> 00:13:11,340
Ma, i've told tony...

171
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:15,845
and i've told you many times.

172
00:13:15,845 --> 00:13:20,483
- You can always
come and live with us.
- I know when i'm not wanted.

173
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:26,605
I just invited you to come and
share my home. If you want me
to beg, that's different.

174
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:31,110
Leave this place...

175
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:33,612
that my husband
and i shared?

176
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:36,615
Change can be a positive.

177
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:40,119
He was a saint.

178
00:13:43,622 --> 00:13:48,127
That son of mine, is he
still having those fits?

179
00:13:49,378 --> 00:13:52,882
They're not fits, ma.
They're anxiety attacks.

180
00:13:52,882 --> 00:13:55,384
He's on medication.

181
00:14:02,057 --> 00:14:05,060
What bmw's
charging us for paint?

182
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:09,565
- Been that way
for six months.
- When was i last here?

183
00:14:10,566 --> 00:14:13,068
Hey...

184
00:14:14,069 --> 00:14:16,572
we maybe
caught a break here, boss.

185
00:14:16,572 --> 00:14:18,574
Shop on watchung avenue...

186
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:21,460
said some guy's brought in
a saturn with these plates,
tryin' to unload it for parts.

187
00:14:21,827 --> 00:14:25,331
Are you tellin' everybody this
fuckin' car's for tony soprano,
and leave it in one piece?

188
00:14:25,714 --> 00:14:28,717
Yeah. Sure.
It's for the kid's teacher.

189
00:14:29,218 --> 00:14:32,221
My guys said that
one of those goofballs
had a uniform on...

190
00:14:32,221 --> 00:14:35,090
from, uh, buttfucks.

191
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:37,977
Whatever. The coffee shop.
I guess the guy works there.

192
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:41,347
Watchung avenue
and what?

193
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:45,351
I'm fuckin' rockford
over here.

194
00:14:49,104 --> 00:14:53,609
Decaf cappuccino prima
nonfat magnifico,
double espresso regolare.

195
00:14:54,109 --> 00:14:56,111
I'll take you
over here, sir.

196
00:14:56,612 --> 00:15:01,116
Um, i think
i'll have an espresso.
Paulie, you want anything?

197
00:15:01,116 --> 00:15:06,121
- They got any just coffee?
- Our cafe du jour
is new zealand peaberry.

198
00:15:06,121 --> 00:15:09,124
Marrone. Whatever.

199
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:12,127
That's 4. 20.
Pick it up over there.
One medium du jour.

200
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:15,631
One single espresso regolare.
Yeah. Keep it.

201
00:15:15,631 --> 00:15:19,134
Du jour, espresso, coming up.
- Honey, let me ask you.

202
00:15:19,134 --> 00:15:22,638
My wife was in the body shop
around the corner on
watchung avenue the other day.

203
00:15:22,638 --> 00:15:26,642
The guy in front of her leaves,
and she sees he dropped...

204
00:15:26,642 --> 00:15:29,645
his money clip,
but he was already gone.

205
00:15:30,145 --> 00:15:32,147
And we'd like
to get it back to him.

206
00:15:32,147 --> 00:15:36,151
She said he was wearing
a uniform like that there.

207
00:15:36,151 --> 00:15:39,154
Real black hair, she said,
tall, little earring.

208
00:15:39,154 --> 00:15:43,158
- I'm sorry, sir, but
these stores are everywhere.
- Tell me about it.

209
00:15:48,547 --> 00:15:52,051
Fuckin' italian people.
How did we miss out
on this?

210
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:55,554
What?
Fuckin' "expresso,"
cappuccino.

211
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:59,058
We invented this shit,
and all these other cocksuckers
are gettin' rich off it.

212
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:03,062
Yeah. Isn't it amazing?
It's not just the money.
It's a pride thing.

213
00:16:03,062 --> 00:16:06,065
All our food.
Pizza. Calzone.

214
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:08,567
Buffalo mozzarella.
Olive oil.

215
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:13,572
These fucks had nothin'. They
ate poopsie before we gave'em
the gift of our cuisine.

216
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:19,194
But this, this is the worst,
this "expresso" shit.
Take it easy.

217
00:16:20,696 --> 00:16:24,199
So she finally agreed
to have somebody
come in days.

218
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:29,705
Carmela called an agency,
and they sent over
this trinidadian woman.

219
00:16:30,706 --> 00:16:34,710
No matter what i do,
i feel guilty.

220
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:36,712
Why?

221
00:16:38,714 --> 00:16:42,217
Well, the real reason is
i know i can't let her
live with us.

222
00:16:42,217 --> 00:16:46,105
That doesn't
seem very practical,
given her personality.

223
00:16:47,606 --> 00:16:50,609
It's my wife.
She won't allow it.

224
00:16:50,859 --> 00:16:52,861
Where are your sisters
in all of this?

225
00:16:52,861 --> 00:16:57,366
Oh, they cut it off with her
a long time ago. No way
she's bunkin' with them.

226
00:16:57,366 --> 00:17:02,371
So you're carrying
all this guilt when your mother
is clearly someone...

227
00:17:02,371 --> 00:17:05,874
who has great difficulty
in maintaining a relationship
with anyone.

228
00:17:07,876 --> 00:17:12,381
But she's my mother.
You're supposed to take care
of your mother.

229
00:17:12,881 --> 00:17:17,886
- She's a little old lady.
- Not to you.
She's very powerful.

230
00:17:17,886 --> 00:17:21,890
- Bullshit.
- You accord
this "little old lady"...

231
00:17:22,391 --> 00:17:25,394
an almost mystical ability
to wreak havoc.

232
00:17:25,394 --> 00:17:28,897
Let me tell ya something.
You definitely don't
wanna get her started.

233
00:17:29,398 --> 00:17:31,900
There are some people who...

234
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:35,404
are not ideal candidates
for parenthood.

235
00:17:35,404 --> 00:17:37,406
Come on.
She's an old sweetie pie.

236
00:17:37,906 --> 00:17:42,411
What were some
of the good experiences
you remember as a child?

237
00:17:42,411 --> 00:17:45,914
The loving, warm ones.

238
00:17:55,924 --> 00:17:58,927
One time we were down
at the shore,

239
00:17:58,927 --> 00:18:02,431
about'68, '69,
the whole family.

240
00:18:02,431 --> 00:18:07,936
My father, he tripped
and he fell down the stairs,
and we were all laughin'.

241
00:18:07,936 --> 00:18:11,940
The whole family was laughin'.
My mother was laughin'.

242
00:18:13,442 --> 00:18:15,944
Any other loving experiences?

243
00:18:15,944 --> 00:18:18,447
Hey, she's a good woman.

244
00:18:18,447 --> 00:18:22,451
She put food
on that table every night.

245
00:18:22,451 --> 00:18:25,954
I'm the ungrateful fuck
'cause i come here
and complain about her,

246
00:18:26,455 --> 00:18:29,958
and i let my wife
exclude her from my home.

247
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:46,091
Hey, ma?

248
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:50,596
You perrilyn?
Yes.

249
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:53,599
Tony soprano.
Ah.

250
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:56,101
How you doin'?
I'm fine, thank you.

251
00:18:58,604 --> 00:19:01,607
Olivia, your son is here!

252
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:06,495
Isn't he a handsome thing?
And look what he brought!

253
00:19:09,498 --> 00:19:12,501
Listen. Let's
get one thing straight.

254
00:19:12,501 --> 00:19:18,006
In the hours you're here
takin' care of my mother,
no ganja, okay?

255
00:19:18,507 --> 00:19:21,009
Hey, ma! Fiore!

256
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:26,014
I'm not dead,
unfortunately for some.

257
00:19:26,014 --> 00:19:29,017
The tall ones
are delphiniums.

258
00:19:29,017 --> 00:19:32,020
You know, frankie valli,
when he visits jersey,

259
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:34,523
this is the florist
he uses.

260
00:19:34,523 --> 00:19:39,027
Aren't they beautiful?
You want me to put them on
the dining room table, olivia?

261
00:19:39,027 --> 00:19:42,898
You make sure
the bottom of that vase
isn't wet.

262
00:19:42,898 --> 00:19:48,036
- Mr. Tony, would you
like some tea or something?
- Coke. Thanks.

263
00:19:54,042 --> 00:19:57,546
So how's it
goin' today?

264
00:19:57,546 --> 00:20:00,916
- She's stealing.
- Who?

265
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:03,418
That ditsoon,"who."

266
00:20:03,418 --> 00:20:08,924
That beautiful plate
that aunt settimia took
from that restaurant in rome--

267
00:20:08,924 --> 00:20:11,426
it's gone.

268
00:20:11,426 --> 00:20:13,929
I don't know, ma.
She seems like a nice person.

269
00:20:14,429 --> 00:20:16,932
She doesn't fool me
for a second.

270
00:20:22,437 --> 00:20:27,943
Sure she stole it?
Sure you didn't give it
to one of the relatives?

271
00:20:27,943 --> 00:20:31,446
You keep forcing
your possessions on people,
thinkin' you're gonna die.

272
00:20:31,947 --> 00:20:34,950
I wish it was tomorrow.

273
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:44,710
- Who does she think she is?
- She's happy, ma.
She's singin'.

274
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:49,214
Anthony, i don't
want her around here.
I can manage somehow.

275
00:20:49,214 --> 00:20:54,469
No. No. I'm not cavin'
into you this time. She stays.

276
00:21:00,475 --> 00:21:03,478
Your uncle called here
lookin' for ya.

277
00:21:03,612 --> 00:21:07,366
- Uncle jun'?
- He sounded agitated.

278
00:21:09,868 --> 00:21:13,739
Jackie,
you're the boss. Tell'em
to leave comley trucking alone.

279
00:21:13,739 --> 00:21:16,491
Didn't know
it was a comley truck.

280
00:21:16,992 --> 00:21:21,496
For 21 fuckin' years, comley's
been puttin' food on my table.
Protection money.

281
00:21:21,496 --> 00:21:24,383
- Chris didn't know goin' in.
- Bullshit.

282
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:27,386
You want my dvd player?
You can watchgrumpy old men.

283
00:21:27,886 --> 00:21:32,391
- You're gonna be a fuckin'
funny boy too, now, huh?
- Hey, you're sopranos.

284
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:34,893
But, jackie, you go around
hopin' you and your uncle
can settle a thing,

285
00:21:34,893 --> 00:21:37,396
just the two of you,
not be invited to
a fuckin' sit- down.

286
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:40,899
You got fuckin' chiricahuas
workin' for you. You don't
control'em.

287
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,903
- Here we go.
- Jackie, you got a ruler?

288
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:50,909
The kids who hit that truck,
they make restitution to junior.

289
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:54,413
Done. It's done.

290
00:21:56,915 --> 00:21:59,918
Christopher montisanti's
a fuckin' loose cannon.
And that filone kid--

291
00:21:59,918 --> 00:22:03,422
- for this, you get a man
out of a sick bed?
- Hey, fuck that shit.

292
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:10,929
Giacobbe,
how you feelin'?

293
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:13,932
I may be acting boss
while the old man's
a guest of the government,

294
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:17,436
but i wish somebody'd
tell my bowels,
'cause they don't obey.

295
00:22:19,938 --> 00:22:23,442
The fuckin' chemo.

296
00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:27,946
- Maybe i should
name a successor.
- This day and age?

297
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:31,450
Who wants the fuckin' job?

298
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:34,453
Your mom tells me
you got a girl comin' in
to help?

299
00:22:35,954 --> 00:22:38,957
That's good.

300
00:22:38,957 --> 00:22:41,960
All right. I gotta go.

301
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:45,330
I'll see you soon.
Okay.

302
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:51,336
We okay?
All right.

303
00:22:54,589 --> 00:22:57,092
A smoke he hires
for his own mother.

304
00:23:00,729 --> 00:23:03,231
Hey, mikey,
how's the boy?

305
00:23:03,231 --> 00:23:05,233
What boy is that, ton'?
The one you sleep with.

306
00:23:05,233 --> 00:23:08,236
Ohh.
I was just kiddin' ya.
How you doin'?

307
00:23:08,737 --> 00:23:10,238
I'm all right.
How's my uncle
treatin' ya?

308
00:23:10,739 --> 00:23:12,741
We're coverin' our nut.
Hey, your nephew, what's he,
retarded?

309
00:23:13,241 --> 00:23:15,744
He likes to play
with trucks or somethin'?
"Retarded"?

310
00:23:15,744 --> 00:23:19,247
What if jerry lewis heard
you talkin' like that?
Oh, that's muscular dystrophy.

311
00:23:19,247 --> 00:23:22,751
It's too bad
they don't have a telethon
for fuckface- itis, huh?

312
00:23:22,751 --> 00:23:27,255
They found a cure yet?
Come on. I was just
kidding you.

313
00:23:27,255 --> 00:23:29,257
Come on.
You're a good sport.
Come on. All right.

314
00:23:29,257 --> 00:23:31,760
You all right?
You all right?
Yeah. I'm all right.

315
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,262
You all right? Yeah.
I'll see you later.
Yeah.

316
00:23:36,214 --> 00:23:39,935
Double cappuccino
suprema.
Double
cappuccino suprema.

317
00:23:42,938 --> 00:23:46,441
Excuse me.
Large nonfat latte.

318
00:23:46,441 --> 00:23:49,694
A guy fittin' the description
does work in this here branch.

319
00:23:50,195 --> 00:23:53,698
His name is eduardo arnaz.
Him and his gay lover
both work here,

320
00:23:53,815 --> 00:23:56,318
and i got the address.

321
00:23:56,318 --> 00:23:59,821
Paulie,
you listenin' to me?
Yeah.

322
00:23:59,821 --> 00:24:02,824
Oh, again with the rape
of the culture.

323
00:24:02,824 --> 00:24:06,328
Can we go find
these spice girls already
and get this over with?

324
00:24:08,213 --> 00:24:11,967
Two small cafe du jours.

325
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:14,836
Half cap on one.

326
00:24:21,476 --> 00:24:23,478
What?

327
00:24:23,979 --> 00:24:26,982
That's it!
What happened?

328
00:24:26,982 --> 00:24:31,987
Beats me.
Did you say something
to her?

329
00:24:31,987 --> 00:24:36,992
I know how
to talk to people.
These blacks.

330
00:24:36,992 --> 00:24:39,995
Who knows what they're
gonna take the wrong way.

331
00:24:39,995 --> 00:24:42,998
So she's gone.

332
00:24:44,499 --> 00:24:47,869
Traffic and weather together
on this tuesday morning.

333
00:24:47,869 --> 00:24:51,122
Here's heather in the chopper.
Over here on the west side,

334
00:24:51,122 --> 00:24:54,626
the delay again this morning
at the inbound lincoln tunnel--

335
00:24:54,626 --> 00:24:58,129
about a 25- minute delay
if you're approaching it
near route 3.

336
00:24:58,129 --> 00:25:01,633
The queue there beginning
just before the bergen viaduct.

337
00:25:01,766 --> 00:25:05,770
You got your marching orders
yesterday. Why didn't you
pay the man his restitution?

338
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:08,773
Restitution, okay, but
you know how much he wants,
your uncle?

339
00:25:08,773 --> 00:25:13,278
Fifteen dollars.
Hey, you jacked the wrong truck,
that's what happens.

340
00:25:17,148 --> 00:25:20,151
I didn't notice you
rushin' to give back
your fuckin' dvd player.

341
00:25:20,151 --> 00:25:24,906
Matter of fact, i'm enjoying it
very much. I screened
the bank dicklast night.

342
00:25:24,906 --> 00:25:28,293
- "Did you warble,
my little wren?"
- I'm not gonna pay it.

343
00:25:28,543 --> 00:25:31,162
- Oh, yeah?
- I'm serious.

344
00:25:31,296 --> 00:25:33,798
No, serious is what happens
if you don't pay--
by my hand.

345
00:25:34,165 --> 00:25:38,670
In my thoughts,
i use the technique
of positive visualization.

346
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:41,172
How come
i always feel undermined?

347
00:25:41,172 --> 00:25:43,675
By what i did on
the triboro towers situation
alone,

348
00:25:44,175 --> 00:25:46,678
i should've been made,
right then-- boom.

349
00:25:46,928 --> 00:25:50,181
- Hmm.
- No. I'm fuckin' serious,
tony.

350
00:25:50,432 --> 00:25:54,069
- The books are closed.
- Did you talk to jackie
about me?

351
00:25:54,069 --> 00:25:57,822
They're not accepting
any new members, okay?

352
00:25:59,074 --> 00:26:03,078
You know, you got a reputation
for immaturity,

353
00:26:03,078 --> 00:26:07,082
and it's not gonna be improved
by not payin' the tributes
the acting boss demands of you.

354
00:26:07,198 --> 00:26:09,701
Acting boss, my ass, ton'.
Come on. Everybody knows...

355
00:26:09,701 --> 00:26:14,706
you really run things since
jackie became the kemo sabe.

356
00:26:14,706 --> 00:26:19,461
Open the fuckin' door.
Open the fuckin' door!
What the fuck?

357
00:26:28,219 --> 00:26:30,221
All right. All right.

358
00:26:30,221 --> 00:26:33,224
Fuck it. But 15 grand
is too much.

359
00:26:33,725 --> 00:26:35,727
I'll tell you what.

360
00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:40,732
You give me the 15k, i'll talk
to uncle junior personally,
and maybe i can get it to 10.

361
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:53,495
One more thing.
You leave comley trucking...

362
00:26:53,495 --> 00:26:56,498
and every other fuckin' item
on this planet that belongs
to my uncle junior,

363
00:26:56,498 --> 00:26:59,000
including
his hemorrhoid doughnut,
the fuck alone.

364
00:26:59,134 --> 00:27:01,136
Got it?

365
00:27:01,636 --> 00:27:03,638
Yeah.

366
00:27:13,014 --> 00:27:15,517
"Did you warble,
my little wren?"

367
00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:19,270
What do you think
his commission'll be?
Two, three grand.

368
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:22,774
Ten to junior. We're lucky,
we net 500 bucks
from the whole thing.

369
00:27:35,787 --> 00:27:38,790
Who is it?

370
00:27:39,174 --> 00:27:42,794
- What?
-

371
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:52,303
mr. Arnaz?
What do you want?

372
00:27:52,303 --> 00:27:55,807
You seen a schoolteacher's
saturn around here?

373
00:27:58,309 --> 00:28:00,945
Come here! --

374
00:28:01,446 --> 00:28:03,948
anybody else here,
desi?

375
00:28:03,948 --> 00:28:07,952
Eddie, i'm ready.
Yep. Here comes lucy now.

376
00:28:08,453 --> 00:28:12,207
Those people
at the airport shuttle
are always late.

377
00:28:12,707 --> 00:28:15,710
- Eddie!
- You boys drove off with the
wrong car a couple of days ago.

378
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:18,830
- Oh, my christ.
- We ain't sayin' shit until
there's an attorney present.

379
00:28:18,963 --> 00:28:21,466
Go ahead. Make a statement.

380
00:28:21,716 --> 00:28:23,718
I got fuckin' johnnie cochran
right here for you!

381
00:28:35,597 --> 00:28:38,099
You boys put a real crimp
in my week.

382
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:42,353
Get over here. --

383
00:28:42,353 --> 00:28:45,356
hey, puss,
here's the fuckin' set.

384
00:28:46,858 --> 00:28:51,329
- Look.
- Fuckin' car's been chopped.
Fuckin' useless now.

385
00:28:51,329 --> 00:28:55,450
- That's not it.
- Then why is that car inside
there? See it? That dodge?

386
00:28:55,450 --> 00:29:00,371
Why is that motherfucker
wearin' a fuckin' plate number
i been carryin' all week?

387
00:29:00,371 --> 00:29:03,374
I don't know.
Let me tell ya
what's gonna happen here.

388
00:29:03,374 --> 00:29:07,762
The two of youse
are climbin' over that fence
and shaggin' those plates.

389
00:29:07,762 --> 00:29:10,765
- But the razor wire--
- then one of you stays
with us...

390
00:29:10,765 --> 00:29:14,769
while the other
goes out on the street
and boosts another saturn.

391
00:29:22,894 --> 00:29:26,397
On the lookout for ducks, dad?
Know the old man
pretty good, huh?

392
00:29:26,898 --> 00:29:28,399
Don't look so sad.
They were cute,

393
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,903
but remember how pissed you were
about the pool filter?

394
00:29:32,403 --> 00:29:35,907
It was special,
them coming here, huh?
Don't you think?

395
00:29:35,907 --> 00:29:38,660
I really wasn't into it.

396
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:43,164
What time's your grandma
gettin' here?

397
00:29:43,298 --> 00:29:46,301
She had to drive fanny
to the doctors.

398
00:29:46,801 --> 00:29:49,804
Then she is picking up
my mother and father,
and they're comin' here.

399
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:52,924
They're each
gonna bring some antipast'.

400
00:29:52,924 --> 00:29:55,927
You know, i complain
about my mother all the time,

401
00:29:55,927 --> 00:29:59,564
about how she just sits at home
and feels sorry for herself,

402
00:30:00,064 --> 00:30:03,685
but she's always ready
to drive those oldster friends
of hers around,

403
00:30:03,685 --> 00:30:05,687
the ones that can't
drive anymore.

404
00:30:05,687 --> 00:30:09,190
I'm proud of her.
It gives me hope.

405
00:30:30,211 --> 00:30:33,214
Ooh. It's getting chilly
out here.

406
00:30:33,464 --> 00:30:38,603
Make plenty of noise
before you open the front door.
You never know who's in there.

407
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:42,473
There's mystar ledger.
Thanks.

408
00:30:42,974 --> 00:30:46,978
Oh, this street.
It's another pain in the ass.

409
00:30:51,733 --> 00:30:56,738
She broke her wrist
on the steerin' column.
A minor concussion.

410
00:30:56,738 --> 00:30:59,624
What about the other woman?

411
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:03,628
- Hip.
-

412
00:31:06,631 --> 00:31:09,634
we were down at the hospital
till 2:00 in the mornin'...

413
00:31:09,634 --> 00:31:12,136
talkin' to her doctor...

414
00:31:12,136 --> 00:31:14,639
and the staff gerontologist.

415
00:31:15,139 --> 00:31:17,642
They're sayin' that she
shouldn't live alone anymore.

416
00:31:20,645 --> 00:31:23,147
She can't
manage the telephone.

417
00:31:24,649 --> 00:31:27,652
And yet you say
she's very healthy and alert.

418
00:31:27,652 --> 00:31:29,654
Like a bull.

419
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:33,157
Why?

420
00:31:33,157 --> 00:31:37,161
I'm just thinking. And
i know there are other doctors
who are right there,

421
00:31:37,161 --> 00:31:43,284
but you know from your own life
that depression
can cause accidents,

422
00:31:43,284 --> 00:31:45,286
poor performance or worse.

423
00:31:45,286 --> 00:31:49,290
So what are you sayin'?
That unconsciously she tried
to whack her best friend?

424
00:31:49,674 --> 00:31:53,177
It's interesting
that you would even take that
from what i said.

425
00:31:55,179 --> 00:31:57,181
Either way,

426
00:31:57,181 --> 00:32:01,185
she could need a change
in her living situation,
be around more people.

427
00:32:01,686 --> 00:32:04,188
Well, we were lookin'
at green grove.

428
00:32:04,188 --> 00:32:08,443
That's a beautiful facility.
It's more like a hotel...

429
00:32:08,443 --> 00:32:10,945
at cap d'antibes.

430
00:32:12,563 --> 00:32:17,068
Yeah, but to her
it's a nursing home.

431
00:32:17,568 --> 00:32:20,071
Well, she needs to be made
to see the distinction,

432
00:32:20,071 --> 00:32:23,074
that in fact she's embarking
on a rewarding chapter.

433
00:32:24,959 --> 00:32:29,580
I know seniors
who are inspired and inspiring.

434
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:41,592
Ladies?

435
00:32:46,597 --> 00:32:49,600
Hey, we're the ones--
kenny portugal said,
"say'hello. '"

436
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,603
Oh, yeah. Kenny.

437
00:32:54,605 --> 00:32:58,109
- What the fuck
is with this cocksucker?
- Back up.

438
00:32:58,609 --> 00:33:01,112
Back up.
Mr. Scorsese, good evening.

439
00:33:01,612 --> 00:33:04,115
Whoa. Wow.
Wow. Ho- ho- ho!

440
00:33:04,499 --> 00:33:08,503
Marty! Kundun.
I liked it.

441
00:33:17,879 --> 00:33:19,881
So my boy at comley...

442
00:33:20,381 --> 00:33:23,384
said there's a truckload
of italian suits.

443
00:33:23,885 --> 00:33:26,888
Those unload fast.
Mario'll take the whole load.

444
00:33:26,888 --> 00:33:31,392
- He said the shipment
moves thursday, 6:00 a. M.
-

445
00:33:33,394 --> 00:33:38,900
- give me one good reason
i should not jack this truck.
- Hey, don't feel bad.

446
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:42,403
It's junior's own fault.
He gives us no choice
except to do it again.

447
00:33:42,403 --> 00:33:44,405
Takin' that outrageous
fuckin' tribute.

448
00:33:44,405 --> 00:33:48,910
Not only does he shit
on our heads, we're supposed
to say,"thanks for the hat."

449
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:52,914
It's not like i'm
gettin' somewheres playin'
by the rules. Fuck tony.

450
00:33:53,414 --> 00:33:55,917
"The books are closed."
Blow me.

451
00:33:55,917 --> 00:34:00,421
No. That's some true shit.
Come on. They're not confirming
any new made guys? How come?

452
00:34:00,421 --> 00:34:04,058
Fucking chaos.
Nobody knows who's
runnin' things anymore.

453
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:09,564
Guys, they don't even know
who to make payments
up the ladder to in some cases.

454
00:34:09,564 --> 00:34:12,567
I'm talkin' about the year 2000,
the millennium.

455
00:34:12,567 --> 00:34:15,570
Where do we go from here?

456
00:34:24,445 --> 00:34:28,449
Mm. Ma,
this virginia ham--

457
00:34:28,449 --> 00:34:32,954
- go. Go and
get yourself some more.
- No. I'm full.

458
00:34:32,954 --> 00:34:35,456
It's good, though.

459
00:34:35,456 --> 00:34:37,959
You never let me feed you.

460
00:34:40,461 --> 00:34:44,966
- So, gettin' back to what
we were talkin' about--
- you want that lamp?

461
00:34:44,966 --> 00:34:48,970
Ma, lie down.
That lamp--
that's real ormolu.

462
00:34:48,970 --> 00:34:53,107
- You know what that's worth
when it's new?
- We're fixed good, lamp- wise.

463
00:34:53,107 --> 00:34:56,477
Take it,
and take the barcalounger.

464
00:34:56,477 --> 00:35:00,481
Somebody's gotta take
this-- this stuff before i die.

465
00:35:00,865 --> 00:35:03,367
Otherwise there's gonna be
an awful lot of stuff here...

466
00:35:03,868 --> 00:35:07,371
that the junkman's gonna have
to cart off to the dump.

467
00:35:07,371 --> 00:35:12,877
Ma, you're not gonna die;
your stuff's not gonna be
hauled off to the dump.

468
00:35:12,877 --> 00:35:14,879
But you do have to start
plannin' for your future.

469
00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:18,382
You got the most rewarding
chapter of your life
comin' up.

470
00:35:18,382 --> 00:35:21,886
- You know my good jewelry?
- The stuff dad gave you?

471
00:35:21,886 --> 00:35:25,389
Yeah, some
of those pieces came right out
of cartier's window, huh?

472
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:29,894
Listen.
Carm doesn't want it.
Not now.

473
00:35:30,394 --> 00:35:32,897
What we both want
is for you to live long...

474
00:35:32,897 --> 00:35:35,900
and wear your sparklers
to your grandchildren's
graduations.

475
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:39,904
I gave it all
to your cousin josephine.

476
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:43,274
- What the fuck?
The good jewelry?
- She always admired it.

477
00:35:43,274 --> 00:35:45,776
They don't have much money.

478
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:49,914
You gave a fuckin' cousin
cartier dinner rings, and you
give me a vibratin' chair?

479
00:35:50,164 --> 00:35:54,669
Your wife
never showed any interest
in my jewels.

480
00:35:54,669 --> 00:35:57,672
She never complimented me
on any of it, as i can remember.

481
00:35:57,672 --> 00:36:00,424
You listen to me, now.
Before you do any more
serious damage...

482
00:36:00,424 --> 00:36:04,929
to yourself or your
grandchildren's inheritance,
you're gonna stop livin' alone.

483
00:36:05,179 --> 00:36:07,181
I'm not going
to that nursing home.

484
00:36:07,682 --> 00:36:11,686
Green grove is a
retirement community, and it's
like a hotel at cap d'antibes.

485
00:36:11,936 --> 00:36:15,306
- Who's he?
- A captain who owns
luxury hotels or somethin'.

486
00:36:15,306 --> 00:36:19,443
I don't know. That's
not the point. The point
is i talked to mrs. Dicaprio.

487
00:36:19,944 --> 00:36:23,948
She's got a corner suite
available with a woods view.
It's gonna go fast.

488
00:36:24,065 --> 00:36:26,067
Of course it's available.
Somebody died.

489
00:36:26,567 --> 00:36:29,070
Oh, ma, you gotta stop!
You gotta stop with this--

490
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:32,707
this black- poison cloud
all the time, 'cause i can't
take it anymore!

491
00:36:33,207 --> 00:36:35,209
Ohh, poor you!

492
00:36:35,209 --> 00:36:38,212
You know,
i got problems at work.
I got problems at home.

493
00:36:38,212 --> 00:36:40,715
I got a friend
who's been diagnosed
with cancer.

494
00:36:40,715 --> 00:36:44,218
Most parents would be grateful
if their yuppie children put as
much thought into this as i did.

495
00:36:44,218 --> 00:36:47,722
- I'm not going to that place.
- Then i will go to court,

496
00:36:47,722 --> 00:36:50,725
and i will get a durable power
of attorney over you
and i will place you there.

497
00:36:50,975 --> 00:36:54,478
Then kill me now.
Go on. Go.
Go into the ham...

498
00:36:54,478 --> 00:36:58,482
and take the carving knife
and stab me here.

499
00:36:58,482 --> 00:37:00,985
Here. Now. Please!

500
00:37:00,985 --> 00:37:03,487
It would hurt me less
than what you just said.

501
00:37:03,988 --> 00:37:07,858
- You know, i know seniors
that are inspired!
-

502
00:37:15,866 --> 00:37:19,870
yo, monty, we said
we'd meet out front.
You're not even dressed.

503
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:23,007
- I'm takin' a pass.
- What?

504
00:37:23,374 --> 00:37:26,377
It's italian suits,
christopher.

505
00:37:26,377 --> 00:37:30,381
There was a time in my life when
bein' with the tony soprano crew
was all i ever dreamed of.

506
00:37:30,881 --> 00:37:33,017
So what am i doing?

507
00:37:33,017 --> 00:37:36,637
- This is some fuckin' note.
- Shh. Don't wake her up.

508
00:37:37,138 --> 00:37:39,140
Come on. It's 5:15.

509
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:43,644
Maybe one reason why things are
so fucked up in the organization
these days...

510
00:37:43,644 --> 00:37:47,648
is guys runnin' off,
not listenin'
to middle management.

511
00:37:48,149 --> 00:37:53,154
- Fuck tony.
That's a quote.
- We have to stick together.

512
00:37:53,154 --> 00:37:57,658
Why be in a crew?
Why be a gangster?

513
00:37:57,658 --> 00:38:00,661
Hey, coach, suck my dick.

514
00:38:00,661 --> 00:38:02,663
Yeah.

515
00:38:16,927 --> 00:38:20,681
Yo! Hey, yo!
We need some help over here.

516
00:38:23,684 --> 00:38:27,688
Okay, let's be very cool, yo.
Get down out of the cab!

517
00:38:27,688 --> 00:38:30,191
You heard the motherfucker!
Hurry up!

518
00:38:30,191 --> 00:38:33,194
Yo, chill.
I'm a friend of billy's,
your friend on the inside?

519
00:38:33,194 --> 00:38:36,697
Yeah? Cool. No probs here.
Increase the peace:
That's our motto.

520
00:38:36,831 --> 00:38:40,835
I'm gonna
take my lunch, okay?
Whatever. Come on.

521
00:38:45,339 --> 00:38:48,342
Hold up, man.
You can't drive a fisher- price.

522
00:38:52,213 --> 00:38:55,216
What's with the gun
pointed sideways shit?

523
00:39:02,223 --> 00:39:04,225
Get out! Come on!
Get down!

524
00:39:04,225 --> 00:39:07,228
You drive.
I'll direct you.

525
00:39:09,363 --> 00:39:11,982
- Jesus! -

526
00:39:12,116 --> 00:39:14,618
control your shit,
fool!

527
00:39:17,238 --> 00:39:20,241
Fuck. Oh, fuck!
Fuck!

528
00:39:22,243 --> 00:39:24,245
Fuck!

529
00:39:25,746 --> 00:39:29,250
Fuck! Junior fuckin' soprano's
gonna go ape- shit! Fuck!

530
00:39:31,385 --> 00:39:34,388
You excited about comin'
to live with us, hon?

531
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:38,642
You will be. Trust me.

532
00:39:39,143 --> 00:39:42,012
Oh, look, ma!
Here's your stuff.

533
00:39:42,012 --> 00:39:45,516
They made good time.
Yeah.

534
00:39:45,516 --> 00:39:49,520
You got your own bed
and your dresser.

535
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:53,157
You know,
when my grandmother went
to live...elsewhere,

536
00:39:53,157 --> 00:39:56,660
they weren't allowed
to bring personal effects.

537
00:40:00,664 --> 00:40:04,418
Ma, you gotta
sign right here.

538
00:40:11,425 --> 00:40:15,930
Yes?

539
00:40:16,297 --> 00:40:20,684
- Mr. Soprano,
do you have an uncle junior?
- He tracked me down here?

540
00:40:20,935 --> 00:40:23,437
Line two?
Here you go.

541
00:40:23,437 --> 00:40:26,440
Tell him i'll call him back.
He'll return the call.

542
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:31,195
He did?
Apparently, it's urgent.
She said he sounded upset.

543
00:40:31,695 --> 00:40:34,198
He'll call back.

544
00:40:37,201 --> 00:40:40,704
Livia, did you ever
hear the old italian saying--

545
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:44,208
my aunt used to go:

546
00:40:50,714 --> 00:40:53,717
- What does that mean, bonnie?
- Time and patience...

547
00:40:53,717 --> 00:40:57,721
change the mulberry leaf
to silk.

548
00:41:10,985 --> 00:41:13,487
You be all right?

549
00:41:13,487 --> 00:41:17,491
Yeah. Sure.
Thanks for all your help.

550
00:41:18,993 --> 00:41:21,495
I'm gonna
make us a nice lunch.

551
00:41:21,495 --> 00:41:23,998
I got some fantastic
prosciut' in there.

552
00:41:27,001 --> 00:41:31,005
Hello? Yep.
It's christopher.

553
00:41:31,121 --> 00:41:33,123
Yeah?

554
00:41:33,624 --> 00:41:36,510
Christ. I been callin'
for hours. Give me a call back
on an outside line.

555
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:52,893
T, don't get mad.

556
00:41:52,893 --> 00:41:55,145
There's been a little shit.
I had nothin' to do with it,
just so you--

557
00:41:55,145 --> 00:41:59,033
spit it out.
Brendan hit comley again.

558
00:41:59,033 --> 00:42:01,285
He what?

559
00:42:02,286 --> 00:42:05,289
And, uh, the driver,
you know--

560
00:42:05,289 --> 00:42:11,295
no, i don't know.
He caught some friendly fire
or something, and he's gone.

561
00:42:12,913 --> 00:42:16,050
Oh, fuck.
What do we do, t?
Brendan didn't fence the load,

562
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:19,670
'cause now he's thinkin'
maybe it was mario who dimed us
to junior last time.

563
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:21,672
Fuck!

564
00:42:39,573 --> 00:42:43,577
Hey, ton'. Sorry you have to
wreck your saturday like this.

565
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:50,334
You boys.
You boys, i'll tell ya.

566
00:42:53,203 --> 00:42:56,707
It's beautiful stuff,
though.
Ton', i'm so sorry.

567
00:42:56,707 --> 00:43:00,210
Shut up.
Just so long as you realize
i had nothing to do with this.

568
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:03,714
Ton', that's true.
He stood home.
Shut up.

569
00:43:03,714 --> 00:43:06,216
You stood home?

570
00:43:07,718 --> 00:43:11,221
Did you do anything to stop it?
Did you offer any guidance?

571
00:43:12,723 --> 00:43:15,225
What do we mean when
we say "leadership"? Hmm?

572
00:43:15,225 --> 00:43:19,730
Ton', part of it's the crank,
but i'm goin' into detox,
swear on my mother.

573
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:23,233
Brendan, shut the fuck up.
You wanna get me clipped?

574
00:43:26,737 --> 00:43:29,740
- What are we gonna do?
- What you're gonna do is
you're gonna take these suits,

575
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:33,243
put'em back in the truck,
go over to comley's main yard
and give'em back.

576
00:43:33,627 --> 00:43:35,996
- Aw, fuck.
- And then you're gonna
call my uncle,

577
00:43:35,996 --> 00:43:38,382
and you're gonna tell'im
when it's done.

578
00:43:38,382 --> 00:43:42,136
- What about the dead guy?
- You keep proddin' him
with a stick.

579
00:43:42,136 --> 00:43:46,006
You light a candle
to st. Anthony. But
i think you're fucked.

580
00:43:48,759 --> 00:43:54,648
Ton', what if this
didn't go back?
Would it be a problem?

581
00:43:58,152 --> 00:44:00,654
You know,
i don't see you assholes
puttin' that rack...

582
00:44:00,654 --> 00:44:03,774
and that rack and this rack here
back in the truck.

583
00:44:12,416 --> 00:44:16,420
Just when i thought i was out,
they pull me back in.

584
00:44:18,288 --> 00:44:21,792
Hey, mr. Miller,
your car is back.

585
00:44:21,792 --> 00:44:25,796
My wife dropped me off
this morning, and there it was.
It was in my parking spot.

586
00:44:26,296 --> 00:44:30,300
My uncle pussy
helped my dad locate it.
Your uncle pussy?

587
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:32,803
Yeah. He's
in the car business.

588
00:44:32,803 --> 00:44:36,807
Well, i don't know what to say
to your dad. I mean, thanks,
of course.

589
00:44:36,807 --> 00:44:38,809
It's nice and clean too.

590
00:44:39,309 --> 00:44:41,195
Whoa. Different keys.

591
00:44:41,695 --> 00:44:45,199
Probably too much
to hope my papers are still
inside the trunk here.

592
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:49,953
It's a different color.
- Whoa.

593
00:44:49,953 --> 00:44:52,956
Ooh.

594
00:44:53,457 --> 00:44:55,959
My dad's a hero.
Mm- hmm.

595
00:45:55,636 --> 00:45:59,139
Did you actually
lose consciousness,
like with the ducks?

596
00:45:59,389 --> 00:46:01,391
No.

597
00:46:01,892 --> 00:46:07,397
Just, uh, a shortness of breath
and white spots
in my field of vision.

598
00:46:07,397 --> 00:46:11,401
- Improvement.
- 'Cause i'm sad
to put my mother away?

599
00:46:11,401 --> 00:46:14,905
Sad is good.
Unconscious isn't.

600
00:46:16,406 --> 00:46:20,410
She'll be in very good hands.
You've done the best for her.

601
00:46:21,411 --> 00:46:23,914
She won't speak to me.

602
00:46:25,415 --> 00:46:28,418
That is sad,
but whose choice is that?

603
00:46:28,418 --> 00:46:31,421
Somehow,
that doesn't make it any better.

604
00:46:31,421 --> 00:46:35,926
Can you admit to yourself
that, yes, you're sad,

605
00:46:36,426 --> 00:46:39,429
but you're very angry
and full of rage?

606
00:46:39,429 --> 00:46:42,933
- I'm sad.
- It's hard to admit that...

607
00:46:42,933 --> 00:46:46,937
you might have feelings of
hatred towards your own mother,
isn't it?

608
00:46:47,437 --> 00:46:49,940
You're out of your tree.

609
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:53,443
Listen to me carefully.
Of course you love her.

610
00:46:53,443 --> 00:46:58,949
What i'm trying to say
is own the anger
instead of displacing it.

611
00:46:58,949 --> 00:47:01,451
Otherwise,
it defines your life.
You know,

612
00:47:01,952 --> 00:47:05,455
it needs to be acknowledged.
It's a good thing
time is up.

613
00:47:05,455 --> 00:47:09,209
I don't wanna talk to you
anymore."hate your mother."

614
00:47:37,487 --> 00:47:39,990
Shit.

615
00:47:41,875 --> 00:47:43,877
A-- what
do you call it-- menu.

616
00:47:45,379 --> 00:47:48,882
"Press two if you
know your party's extension."

617
00:47:48,882 --> 00:47:52,386
Is that an operator
or an answering machine?

618
00:47:52,502 --> 00:47:54,504
Let's see. Hello?
Hello?

619
00:47:54,888 --> 00:47:56,890
Hello?

620
00:47:56,890 --> 00:47:59,509
Hello?

621
00:47:59,509 --> 00:48:02,012
"Press zero."
Hello?

622
00:48:02,012 --> 00:48:05,015
Hello? Hello?

623
00:48:05,515 --> 00:48:08,018
Hello--

624
00:48:09,305 --> 00:49:09,683
