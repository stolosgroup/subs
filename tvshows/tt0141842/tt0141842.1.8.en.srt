2
00:01:50,126 --> 00:01:53,129
In the czech republic, too,
we love pork.

3
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:55,748
Ever had our sausages?

4
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:04,757
In the czech republic, too,
we love pork.

5
00:02:04,757 --> 00:02:07,760
You ever had our sausages?

6
00:02:28,665 --> 00:02:31,784
- Adriana?
- In the czech republic, too,
we love pork.

7
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:33,920
Ever had our sausages?

8
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:41,294
Emil kolar?

9
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:45,798
- Help you?
- Salami sub, hold the mayo.

10
00:02:45,798 --> 00:02:47,800
We're out of mayo.

11
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:53,806
Change my meat
to black forest.

12
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:06,953
- You killed me.
- What do you want me
to do about it now?

13
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:10,456
- I wanna tell you.
- Tell me what?
You come here every night.

14
00:03:10,456 --> 00:03:13,459
- You fucked up.
- What do you mean?

15
00:03:15,211 --> 00:03:17,213
Here's these.

16
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:18,831
Where did you find'em?

17
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:22,335
One in the table.
Three in my skull.

18
00:03:24,837 --> 00:03:27,340
You will have our sausages.

19
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:30,226
Get rid of these.

20
00:03:30,226 --> 00:03:32,729
Let go of me! Let go!

21
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,492
I would have wrapped it, but--
that's okay.
A computer!

22
00:03:46,993 --> 00:03:50,496
This model got such a good
write- up, i got one for myself.
You're gonna love it.

23
00:03:50,496 --> 00:03:54,000
Let's move on, okay?
Congratulations.
God bless.

24
00:03:59,756 --> 00:04:02,258
Hon, you look gorgeous.
By the way,
who's your date?

25
00:04:02,258 --> 00:04:05,762
I'll give you "who's
your date." come here.
Good to see you.

26
00:04:05,762 --> 00:04:07,764
Congratulations.
Thank you.

27
00:04:07,764 --> 00:04:10,266
Melissa was beautiful
up there.
I know. Thank you.

28
00:04:10,266 --> 00:04:12,769
Oh, mama livia.
Come esta, darling?

29
00:04:13,269 --> 00:04:18,274
Listen to him with
that "my darling."
I am nobody's darling.

30
00:04:18,274 --> 00:04:20,777
This one here,
she never disappoints ya,
i'll tell ya that.

31
00:04:20,777 --> 00:04:23,780
Are you still seeing
your other women, lorenzo?

32
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:26,282
Come on, ma.
Let's mingle.

33
00:04:26,282 --> 00:04:28,284
Sorry. The older she gets,
the worse she gets.

34
00:04:28,785 --> 00:04:31,788
Ah. Listen. I heard
some disturbing shit
last night.

35
00:04:31,788 --> 00:04:35,792
I wanted to talk to you about
it. But with the rehearsal
dinner and everything, it just--

36
00:04:35,792 --> 00:04:38,294
yeah.
I-- there's
the priest, though.

37
00:04:38,294 --> 00:04:40,296
I'll be right back.
Go ahead.

38
00:04:46,302 --> 00:04:50,807
Yeah! Whoo!

39
00:04:51,174 --> 00:04:53,676
Salute!

40
00:04:53,676 --> 00:04:55,678
Federal indictments?
Yeah.

41
00:04:55,678 --> 00:04:58,181
Where the fuck
you get this?
I got a guy who owes me.

42
00:04:58,181 --> 00:05:02,185
He's got agoomatowho
works at f. B. I. Headquarters
as a word processor.

43
00:05:02,185 --> 00:05:06,689
When's it comin' down?
I don't know. When she
knows, she'll tell me.

44
00:05:06,689 --> 00:05:09,575
Indictments? What the fuck
you talkin' about?
You sure about this?

45
00:05:09,575 --> 00:05:14,080
It ain't just my source in
jersey. Half of new york moved
to fort lauderdale already.

46
00:05:14,197 --> 00:05:16,699
Fuck. They're gonna
want my ass.

47
00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:20,703
Why?
What do you mean, why?
I'm o. C.

48
00:05:20,703 --> 00:05:24,207
When'd you get
your fuckin' wings?
I didn't.

49
00:05:24,707 --> 00:05:27,210
Not yet anyway.

50
00:05:27,593 --> 00:05:30,596
Uncle junior, you got anything
you wanna say about this?

51
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:33,599
You guys see indictments
under your bed at night.

52
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:37,103
Right away you're ready to lam
it. As far as i'm concerned,
it's just speculation.

53
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:41,107
- It's rumor.
- Better be safe
than sorry, no?

54
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:44,110
I say we duck for a while.
And what are we gonna do?

55
00:05:44,227 --> 00:05:45,728
Close shop?
We can't do that.

56
00:05:46,229 --> 00:05:47,980
Tony, what do you think?

57
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:52,985
What the fuck you askin'
him for? I just--
i just gave you the answer.

58
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:55,488
Junior's right. We go on
the lam now, it's open season.

59
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:58,991
The fuckin' albanians
will be livin' in our houses.
Fuck!

60
00:05:58,991 --> 00:06:00,993
I just gave a g- note to
larry boy's kid for the boost.

61
00:06:00,993 --> 00:06:03,996
If i knew i may have to lam
in a hurry, i would've duked
her another time.

62
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:15,258
Thank you, darlin'.
Gotta go.

63
00:06:15,758 --> 00:06:18,261
Say good- bye
to your father for me.

64
00:06:19,762 --> 00:06:23,766
I agree with my uncle.
He calls the shots,
we do it.

65
00:06:23,766 --> 00:06:26,769
But maybe, for today,
for right now...

66
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:30,773
you were thinkin', uncle jun,
that everybody should do
a little spring cleaning.

67
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:33,526
That was my next comment.

68
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:43,035
We're goin' right now.
Let's go.

69
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:47,039
Come on. We have to go.

70
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:10,813
Think they're gonna come
over the weekend?

71
00:07:10,813 --> 00:07:13,316
They're comin' someday.

72
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:20,323
- Where's the rest of the money?
- It's everywhere.

73
00:07:20,323 --> 00:07:22,825
Well, get it.

74
00:07:24,327 --> 00:07:27,830
What else?
How'bout your phone numbers?

75
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:29,832
Anybody who's anybody
is in my head.

76
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:37,723
What's the matter?

77
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,843
Nothin'.
Just here we go.

78
00:07:40,843 --> 00:07:44,347
Here.
Why now?

79
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,600
Why the fuck now, just
when things we're goin' good?

80
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:57,994
Boot your computer.
The cops are coming.

81
00:07:58,494 --> 00:08:01,998
- So?
- You want them to see all that
porno you downloaded?

82
00:08:01,998 --> 00:08:04,500
Shit!

83
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:14,260
You better give me
your jewelry.

84
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:17,263
Jesus.
Hey.

85
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:21,767
They know we can't produce
receipts. You want'em stealing
this shit from us?

86
00:08:25,388 --> 00:08:29,892
Come on.
I'm not giving you my engagement
ring. This isn't stolen.

87
00:08:31,394 --> 00:08:37,033
Is it?
No. What do you
think i am?

88
00:08:38,534 --> 00:08:40,653
Come on.
Give me that.

89
00:09:07,563 --> 00:09:09,565
Adriana!

90
00:09:11,067 --> 00:09:13,569
It ate my whole script now!

91
00:09:16,572 --> 00:09:18,574
You're still on the file.

92
00:09:18,574 --> 00:09:20,576
You must've deleted
the text.

93
00:09:20,576 --> 00:09:23,079
What the fuck--
whatever, whatev--
you fuckin' asshole!

94
00:09:23,079 --> 00:09:26,582
All right, stop
with the hysteria,
would you, please?

95
00:09:26,582 --> 00:09:30,586
If you're gonna keep behavin'
like a baby, fuck it, i'm not
gonna help you, christopher.

96
00:09:31,087 --> 00:09:35,091
- I mean it.
- At least you work that squirrel
program in the restaurant.

97
00:09:38,094 --> 00:09:40,596
There.
The text came back.

98
00:09:41,097 --> 00:09:44,600
You put it in
buffer memory.
What do you think?

99
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,103
Of the script?

100
00:09:47,103 --> 00:09:50,606
Babe, i can't like give
an opinion every time
you add a sentence.

101
00:09:50,606 --> 00:09:53,109
I gotta have
the whole story flow.

102
00:09:53,109 --> 00:09:55,611
I'm startin' with the dialogue.

103
00:10:05,121 --> 00:10:08,624
"Imanugedto get
the drop on him"?

104
00:10:08,624 --> 00:10:11,627
Do you mean to say,
"imanagedto get
the drop on him"?

105
00:10:11,627 --> 00:10:15,631
Or is he saying"manuge,"
like"manugia l'american"?

106
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:26,642
My tennessee william.

107
00:10:31,147 --> 00:10:33,649
Where you goin'?

108
00:10:33,649 --> 00:10:35,651
Get over here.

109
00:10:37,153 --> 00:10:40,656
I have never seen you
apply yourself like this.

110
00:10:40,656 --> 00:10:43,659
I love movies.
You know that.

111
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,663
That smell in blockbuster,
that candy and carpet smell,

112
00:10:48,164 --> 00:10:50,166
i get high off it.

113
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:54,170
I'm gonna let all this
love and knowledge
go to waste?

114
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:57,673
My cousin gregory's
girlfriend amy, the one that
works for tarantino, said,

115
00:10:57,673 --> 00:11:00,176
"mob stories
are always hot."

116
00:11:00,676 --> 00:11:03,679
I can make my mark.

117
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:06,182
Babe,
with these indictments,

118
00:11:06,682 --> 00:11:11,187
shouldn't you put
the script away for a while
and get rid of evidence?

119
00:11:12,688 --> 00:11:15,691
Travel light.
Free bird.

120
00:11:15,691 --> 00:11:19,695
You stole this computer,
plus the one
you just gave melissa.

121
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,702
- I'm writing!
- Turn on channel 6.

122
00:11:26,702 --> 00:11:28,704
Turn on channel 6.

123
00:11:31,707 --> 00:11:35,711
New jersey attorney general
james d. Ricci stated
at a fund- raiser...

124
00:11:35,711 --> 00:11:38,714
that a grand jury has been
impanelled to investigate...

125
00:11:38,714 --> 00:11:42,718
possible mob activities
in the garden state,
with indictments to follow.

126
00:11:43,085 --> 00:11:46,839
With us is syndicated columnist
and author ofmafia:

127
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:50,342
America's longest running
soap opera, jeffrey wernick.

128
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:52,845
First of all, welcome.
Thank you.
Pleasure to be here.

129
00:11:52,978 --> 00:11:56,982
For years now, the f. B. I.
Has been telling us that
the mafia is all but dead.

130
00:11:57,483 --> 00:12:00,486
Let me interject.
While it is true...

131
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:03,489
that the mob is getting
a standing- eight count,

132
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:05,491
uh, i wouldn't call
the fight.

133
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:07,993
The government knows this
better than anyone.

134
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:12,498
Murder, truck hijacking as well
as money laundering are expected
to be among the inquiries.

135
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:15,000
Do we know yet
the names of those
who will be indicted?

136
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:17,002
Well, the indictments
are sealed.

137
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:21,006
But with the recent death
of acting di meo family boss,
jackie aprile,

138
00:12:21,006 --> 00:12:25,010
my sources tell me that
corrado "junior" soprano...

139
00:12:25,127 --> 00:12:27,630
was made new boss
after the death of aprile.

140
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:32,768
The sopranos have
long historic ties to
the new york families.

141
00:12:32,768 --> 00:12:35,271
What about these possible
murder charges?

142
00:12:35,271 --> 00:12:39,024
They will undoubtedly
be focused on
the as- yet- unsolved...

143
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:43,395
execution- style slaying
of soprano family associate,
brendan filone.

144
00:12:43,395 --> 00:12:47,399
Uh, was it part
of a power struggle?
Interesting.

145
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,402
No one would ever have
ranked him as associate!
My associates tell me that...

146
00:12:50,786 --> 00:12:54,290
filone is a loyal soldier, if
you will, and he winds up dead--
soldier?

147
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:57,660
Brendan filone!
Associate? Soldier?

148
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,162
Fuck you!
Jesus.

149
00:13:08,671 --> 00:13:13,175
Georgie, did you see it
from the beginning?
Did they mention my name?

150
00:13:13,676 --> 00:13:17,680
No-- stop the fuckin'
chitchat, all right.
I gotta go. I gotta go.

151
00:13:22,685 --> 00:13:25,688
Nobody makes "ginzo" gravy
like you, nana.

152
00:13:25,688 --> 00:13:29,191
You know, i'm up at bard
waiting for my care package.

153
00:13:29,191 --> 00:13:31,193
I don't like
that word, jason.

154
00:13:31,193 --> 00:13:34,079
- What? Ginzo?
- The word is offensive.

155
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,583
She's right, jason.
It's not a nice word.
Sorry, nana.

156
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:39,702
- What's it mean?
- Derived from the word
"guinea."

157
00:13:39,702 --> 00:13:42,955
- What's that mean?
- It's a derogation.

158
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:46,458
I have a patient,
you wouldn't wanna say the word
"guinea" in front of him.

159
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,961
Huh, italian male
seeing a shrink.

160
00:13:48,961 --> 00:13:51,463
Let me guess.
Mother issues.

161
00:13:51,463 --> 00:13:53,966
- Why wouldn't you say it, mom?
- You just wouldn't.

162
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:57,970
What, you'd be scared?
Is he in the mafia?
I shouldn't have mentioned it.

163
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,972
Can't we change
the subject?

164
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:03,475
No way. What's he do, mom?
Is he in the mob or what?

165
00:14:03,475 --> 00:14:05,477
He's not a mobster,
is he, jen?

166
00:14:05,477 --> 00:14:09,982
Nobody knows better
than you, richard,
i can't discuss my patients.

167
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:13,986
I just hope he's not
one of those crumbs they're
talkin' about on the news.

168
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:18,490
Jen, just refer him
to another doctor. You could
do that, couldn't you?

169
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:23,245
- Grate the cheese, dad, okay?
- Sure she can.

170
00:14:23,245 --> 00:14:25,748
That might be what
you would do, richard.

171
00:14:25,748 --> 00:14:28,751
Now i remember why
we got divorced.

172
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:32,504
Why should i refer him
to another doctor?
He's my patient.

173
00:14:32,504 --> 00:14:34,139
You know you can't treat
sociopaths.

174
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:36,141
He's scum and you shouldn't
help him with his bed- wetting.

175
00:14:36,141 --> 00:14:40,145
You have no idea
who this man is,
and yet you call him scum.

176
00:14:40,145 --> 00:14:43,649
People like him are
the reason italian- americans
have such a bad image.

177
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:49,154
I agree.
Ask any american to describe
an italian- american,

178
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:53,659
and invariably he's gonna
referencethe godfather,
goodfellas.

179
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:57,162
Good movies.
And the rest
are gonna mention pizza.

180
00:14:57,162 --> 00:14:59,164
Good movies
to eat pizza by.

181
00:14:59,164 --> 00:15:02,668
Stop it, jason.
I never said he was
in the mafia.

182
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:05,170
Why do you think we're never
gonna see an italian president?

183
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:07,172
And that's
my patient's fault?

184
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:11,677
- Hey.
- I realize you're very involved
in the antidefamation lobby.

185
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:16,682
So go after hollywood if you
feel you absolutely have to,
but leave my patient alone.

186
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:21,687
It's a synergy. News items
and the constant portrayal of
italian- americans as gangsters.

187
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:27,192
Wasn't the italian antidef deal
started by joe colombo,
a mobster?

188
00:15:27,192 --> 00:15:29,695
Italians against discrimination
did a study,

189
00:15:30,195 --> 00:15:33,315
and in its height,
the mafia in this country
had less than 5, 000 members.

190
00:15:33,315 --> 00:15:36,702
And yet, that tiny,
insignificant fraction...

191
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:41,206
cast such a dark shadow
over 20 million
hard- working americans.

192
00:15:41,323 --> 00:15:43,325
Dad, at this point
in our cultural history,

193
00:15:43,325 --> 00:15:46,829
mob movies are classic
american cinema,
like westerns.

194
00:15:47,329 --> 00:15:49,832
I have to agree there, rich.
You know,

195
00:15:50,332 --> 00:15:52,334
you never saw that scotch- irish
pissin' and moanin'...

196
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:56,221
about always bein' portrayed
as, as rustlers
and gunslingers.

197
00:15:56,338 --> 00:15:59,842
That's absurd.
See what you started
with your gravy, nana?

198
00:15:59,842 --> 00:16:03,846
To we,
the 20 million.

199
00:16:03,979 --> 00:16:05,981
- Salute.
- Salute.

200
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:09,351
Salute.

201
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:27,503
- What?

202
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:30,756
- Get down here right away.
We're exterminatin'.
- I'm kind of busy now.

203
00:16:30,873 --> 00:16:32,875
And get some sfogliatelle
and cannoli and shit
for the guys.

204
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:35,127
Yeah.

205
00:16:48,524 --> 00:16:51,527
Twenty- nine.

206
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:01,286
Here you go, big guy.
Thank you.

207
00:17:10,546 --> 00:17:12,047
Hey, gino.
What can i get you?

208
00:17:12,414 --> 00:17:15,417
Give me some--
whoa, whoa.
Number 34, right here.

209
00:17:15,417 --> 00:17:18,170
He was in line.
He just went out to go
get gas in his car.

210
00:17:18,554 --> 00:17:22,558
Oh, so i could go out,
fuck your sister, come back
saturday, i go to the front?

211
00:17:22,925 --> 00:17:26,311
- I said he could.
- Hey, poppin' fresh,
i'm in no fuckin' mood today.

212
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:29,314
I'm next.
Now get a fuckin' pastry box.

213
00:17:29,431 --> 00:17:31,433
Gino, what can i get ya?

214
00:17:31,683 --> 00:17:34,186
Oh!
It's all right, dougie.
Let him go first.

215
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:36,438
No. He don't make
the rules here.

216
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:40,325
All right, let me have
two neapolitan loaves--

217
00:17:40,576 --> 00:17:44,696
you touch a single fuckin'
crust, you're gonna wish you
took that job at mcdonald's.

218
00:17:44,696 --> 00:17:49,084
- Fuck you.
- Okay, take a walk.

219
00:17:49,084 --> 00:17:53,088
What about my bread?
You come back
in ten minutes.

220
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:56,592
- What the fuck do you
think you're doin'?
- Come on.

221
00:18:03,966 --> 00:18:07,352
Come on. Get up.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

222
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:10,856
What is it? What is it?
Do i look like a pussy to you?

223
00:18:11,356 --> 00:18:12,858
No.
I'm serious.
Be honest.

224
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:15,360
I won't get mad.
No.

225
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,364
Why the fuck would you give me
a hard time and talk to me like
i'm nothin' to worry about?

226
00:18:19,364 --> 00:18:21,867
I- i- i'm sorry.

227
00:18:21,867 --> 00:18:25,737
Get a pastry box.
Move it!

228
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:31,877
That's better.
Now fill it...

229
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:34,880
with cannoli, sfogliatelle
and napoleons.

230
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,882
Okay.

231
00:18:38,884 --> 00:18:41,887
- Move!
-

232
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:45,757
good.

233
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:51,263
Give me the box.
Come on.

234
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,515
Here.

235
00:18:59,521 --> 00:19:03,025
Next time you see my face,
show some respect.

236
00:19:03,025 --> 00:19:05,160
I will.

237
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:08,914
You motherfucker!

238
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:12,534
- You shot my foot!
- It happens.

239
00:19:12,534 --> 00:19:15,037
Oh, you fuckin' asshole!

240
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:22,427
If i'm gettin' an invitation
to the dance,

241
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:24,930
i wish the feds would hurry
the fuck up about it.

242
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:26,932
You heard what
they're sayin' on the news.

243
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:29,434
The way things are workin',
it's gonna be junior's party.

244
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:32,437
That was a far- thinkin' plan
you had there, ton.

245
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:37,442
I called you
last christmas.
Fuck this.

246
00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:41,446
Hey, the sfogliatelle.
What's wrong with you?

247
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:44,950
What are you doin'?
Were you brought up
in a barn or what?

248
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:48,453
What's the matter with you,
huh? This is no time to go
on the rag, christopher.

249
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:51,957
Not with the indictment shit
comin' down.

250
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:55,460
Take georgie,
go in the bathroom,
sweep for bugs, okay?

251
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,462
Come on.

252
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:06,972
Well, i hope
they'll be all right.

253
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:10,726
- Who?
- The guys.

254
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:12,477
- What about me?
- You'll be all right.

255
00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:15,097
They didn't even mention
your name on television.

256
00:20:15,097 --> 00:20:18,100
Fuckin' amazing,
though, huh?
You know what, that news guy,

257
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:21,603
he said the words,"brendan
filone," i'm tellin' ya, the
hairs on the back of my neck,

258
00:20:22,104 --> 00:20:23,605
they fuckin' stood up.

259
00:20:24,106 --> 00:20:28,110
- I mean, i knew the guy.
- They made him look like
john fuckin' gotti.

260
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:30,112
I brought him around here.

261
00:20:30,612 --> 00:20:34,116
Tony wouldn't have never
known him if it wasn't for me.

262
00:20:34,616 --> 00:20:37,252
Huh. I had no idea.

263
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,141
Who is it?
I'm sleeping!

264
00:20:59,141 --> 00:21:02,144
Carmela.
Oh, come on in.

265
00:21:02,277 --> 00:21:06,782
I- i- i just said that in case
you were that snooty- ass...

266
00:21:06,782 --> 00:21:09,284
mrs. Ryan down the hall.

267
00:21:09,284 --> 00:21:14,289
Oh, she is so shanty irish,
and with all her airs.

268
00:21:14,289 --> 00:21:16,291
Come on. Get dressed.
I'm taking you to brunch.

269
00:21:16,792 --> 00:21:18,794
What?
You heard me.
Get dressed.

270
00:21:18,794 --> 00:21:23,298
What's wrong? Tell me.
Nothing is wrong, ma. Why does
something have to be wrong?

271
00:21:23,298 --> 00:21:25,050
Is it meadow?
She eats like a bird.

272
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:28,553
Everything is fine, ma.
Relax. Nothing is wrong.

273
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:33,425
But you come here unannounced.
And i- i shouldn't wonder
if something's wrong?

274
00:21:33,925 --> 00:21:36,061
Oh, jeez. I'm sorry.

275
00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:39,064
It's a nice day.
I thought i would
take you out.

276
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:43,435
I don't wanna go out.

277
00:21:46,321 --> 00:21:48,824
Is it anthony?
Those indictments?

278
00:21:48,824 --> 00:21:51,326
His father could take it
in stride, but he can't.

279
00:21:51,827 --> 00:21:53,578
I don't believe you.

280
00:21:57,332 --> 00:22:00,085
- Come on, ma.
Will you get dressed?
- We just went to a wedding.

281
00:22:00,585 --> 00:22:04,589
That was a big to- do.
This way, you and me, we get
to spend some quality time.

282
00:22:07,092 --> 00:22:10,095
The manor is gonna stop
serving brunch any minute.

283
00:22:13,098 --> 00:22:16,101
Did he cheat on you again?

284
00:22:17,969 --> 00:22:21,473
You know,
i try to do something nice.
I come here to take you out.

285
00:22:21,973 --> 00:22:26,478
Right away you think
i have some other agenda that
i have to talk toyouabout?

286
00:22:26,478 --> 00:22:29,481
Don't flatter yourself.

287
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:32,984
I'll, uh--
i'll throw something on.

288
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:39,124
Buckle your seat belt, ma.

289
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:42,627
I can't find it.
Where is it?

290
00:24:07,078 --> 00:24:10,332
It's not definite.
I just thought i'd tell ya,

291
00:24:10,332 --> 00:24:13,335
you know, in case i don't
show up for an appointment.

292
00:24:13,468 --> 00:24:15,971
So, you're telling me
that you're planning
a vacation,

293
00:24:15,971 --> 00:24:18,473
but you're not sure
exactly when it will be?

294
00:24:18,723 --> 00:24:21,226
Right.

295
00:24:21,726 --> 00:24:24,095
I may never go.

296
00:24:26,097 --> 00:24:28,099
Let's put it this way.

297
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:32,354
There's a strong possibility
that it-- it could happen.

298
00:24:34,356 --> 00:24:38,994
Does this have anything
to do with what's been
on the news lately?

299
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:46,251
So, if you, uh, suddenly stop
coming to your appointments,

300
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:49,254
i will assume that
you are on vacation.

301
00:24:49,371 --> 00:24:52,374
And i should wait
to be contacted?

302
00:24:52,374 --> 00:24:56,127
That would be
a good assumption.

303
00:25:01,132 --> 00:25:04,636
Who is it?
Paulie.
Open the door.

304
00:25:24,155 --> 00:25:26,658
I thought we were
steppin' out.

305
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:31,663
I got two broads in the car.
You said ad' went to stay
at her mother's.

306
00:25:36,668 --> 00:25:40,171
No wonder.
This place looks like
a fuckin' sty.

307
00:25:42,674 --> 00:25:45,927
What's wrong with you?

308
00:25:45,927 --> 00:25:48,680
Talk to me.
This ain't like you, kid.

309
00:25:51,316 --> 00:25:53,435
I ran into
billy cracchiolo.

310
00:25:53,435 --> 00:25:55,820
The meter maid?
What about him?

311
00:25:55,937 --> 00:25:58,940
Told me the regular cops
in nutley are lookin'
for a guy.

312
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:02,444
Blew off a kid's toe
for no good reason
in russo's bakery.

313
00:26:02,944 --> 00:26:04,946
Drove a lexus.

314
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:10,452
Does tony know about this?

315
00:26:11,453 --> 00:26:13,455
What's goin' on, chrissy?

316
00:26:13,955 --> 00:26:16,458
Been workin' my ass off
on this movie script.

317
00:26:16,958 --> 00:26:20,211
You know how many pages
i got? Nineteen.

318
00:26:21,212 --> 00:26:23,715
That a lot
or a little?

319
00:26:23,715 --> 00:26:27,218
Books say movie's supposed
to be about 120 pages.

320
00:26:27,218 --> 00:26:29,721
Got this fuckin' computer.
I thought it would
do a lot of it.

321
00:26:29,971 --> 00:26:31,973
You ain't bein' frank
about the business, kid?

322
00:26:32,357 --> 00:26:33,858
I would never do that.

323
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:36,361
It's only "suggested by."
That writer,

324
00:26:36,861 --> 00:26:41,366
with the bullfights,
blew his own fuckin' head off.

325
00:26:41,366 --> 00:26:43,868
I bought a script- writin'
program and everything.

326
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:47,122
My advice.
Put that thing down a while.

327
00:26:47,622 --> 00:26:49,124
We go get our joints copped,

328
00:26:49,624 --> 00:26:52,627
and tomorrow, the words
will come blowin' out your ass.

329
00:26:54,629 --> 00:26:57,132
You ever feel like
nothin' good was ever
gonna happen to you?

330
00:26:57,132 --> 00:26:59,634
Yeah. And nothin' did.
So what?

331
00:27:00,135 --> 00:27:01,636
I'm alive.
I'm survivin'.

332
00:27:02,137 --> 00:27:05,140
That's it.
I don't wanna just survive.

333
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:10,145
Says in these movie- writing
books that every character
has an arc. You understand?

334
00:27:12,147 --> 00:27:14,149
Like everybody starts out
somewheres,

335
00:27:14,149 --> 00:27:17,652
and then they do somethin'
or somethin' gets done to them,
it changes their life.

336
00:27:17,652 --> 00:27:21,156
That's called their arc.
Where's my arc?

337
00:27:23,658 --> 00:27:27,412
Take richard kimble,
all right?

338
00:27:27,412 --> 00:27:31,916
No, that's no good.
His arc is run, run,
jump off a damn-- run.

339
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:34,919
Uh--

340
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:36,921
keanu reeves, devil's advocate.
You see that?

341
00:27:37,422 --> 00:27:39,424
Al.
Right.

342
00:27:40,925 --> 00:27:45,430
Keanu's a lawyer.
Gets all turned on by money,
power and the devil.

343
00:27:45,547 --> 00:27:49,551
Then his wife says to him,
"you're not the man i married."
Leaves him.

344
00:27:49,551 --> 00:27:51,803
You see the arc?

345
00:27:53,304 --> 00:27:57,809
He starts down here.
He ends up here.

346
00:27:57,809 --> 00:28:00,311
Where's my arc, paulie?

347
00:28:00,812 --> 00:28:04,315
Kid, richard kimble,

348
00:28:04,315 --> 00:28:06,818
thedevil'swhatever,
those are all make- believe.

349
00:28:06,951 --> 00:28:09,954
Hey, i got no arc either.

350
00:28:09,954 --> 00:28:13,458
I was born, grew up,
spent a few years in the army,

351
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:16,461
a few more in the can
and here i am.

352
00:28:16,461 --> 00:28:18,463
A half a wise guy.
So what?

353
00:28:18,463 --> 00:28:20,832
I got no identity.

354
00:28:21,332 --> 00:28:25,336
I mean, even brendan filone's
got an identity. He's dead.

355
00:28:25,336 --> 00:28:28,840
I killed that fuckin'
emil kolar and nothin'.

356
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:33,344
I don't even move up a notch.
All i got is nightmares.

357
00:28:33,344 --> 00:28:35,847
That polish, czech, slavic,
whatever the fuck he is,

358
00:28:35,847 --> 00:28:38,349
is hauntin' me in my dreams
every night.

359
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:42,487
That happens.
The more of them you do,
the better you'll sleep.

360
00:28:42,487 --> 00:28:45,490
I had one prick chasin' me
for months in my dreams.

361
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:47,992
I feel like he's tryin'
to tell me somethin'.

362
00:28:47,992 --> 00:28:50,995
That we fucked up
the night that we buried him.
We didn't fuck up.

363
00:28:50,995 --> 00:28:53,498
- That i'm in danger.
- Could i ask you a question?

364
00:28:53,498 --> 00:28:56,000
Why the fuck would he wanna
tell you you're in danger,

365
00:28:56,501 --> 00:28:59,504
considering you put
a fuckin' moon roof
in the back of his head?

366
00:28:59,754 --> 00:29:02,257
What did we do wrong
that night?

367
00:29:02,757 --> 00:29:05,760
The gun was hot,
so the slugs in his head
couldn't be traced back to me.

368
00:29:06,127 --> 00:29:08,763
You know who had an arc?
Noah.

369
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,402
Is that him?

370
00:29:31,903 --> 00:29:35,540
Now that would be
some fuckin' coincidence
if it wasn't, wouldn't it?

371
00:29:38,042 --> 00:29:40,545
Holy shit!
Look at that!

372
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:44,165
- What?
- He was clean shaven.
He's got a fuckin' beard now.

373
00:29:44,666 --> 00:29:46,668
You know what?
I read that. That happens.

374
00:29:47,051 --> 00:29:49,053
Jesus. I always thought
it was bullshit.

375
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:51,172
Oh! Look
at his fingernails!

376
00:29:51,306 --> 00:29:55,677
- Oh, fuck!
They're like a woman's.
- I'm gonna fuckin' puke.

377
00:29:57,178 --> 00:29:59,180
All right, help me lift him.

378
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:02,684
We'll take him down to
pine barons before they build
a fuckin' condo here.

379
00:30:02,684 --> 00:30:04,686
Georgie!

380
00:30:08,323 --> 00:30:10,325
I don't know about
selling this property.

381
00:30:10,825 --> 00:30:14,329
I don't know about you,
but i sure as hell
could use an infusion...

382
00:30:14,329 --> 00:30:17,332
if we're gonna support jas
after he graduates.

383
00:30:17,332 --> 00:30:22,337
It's funny how
even during our marriage
we saw things differently.

384
00:30:22,337 --> 00:30:26,457
I never saw this place
as an investment.

385
00:30:26,457 --> 00:30:28,960
I always thought
that we'd build a house.

386
00:30:30,461 --> 00:30:32,964
So, are we gonna sell
or what?

387
00:30:32,964 --> 00:30:34,966
For jason.

388
00:30:35,466 --> 00:30:39,354
But, you know, i don't wanna
hear that you took one of
your colleens on a cruise.

389
00:30:39,721 --> 00:30:42,223
What's that supposed to mean,
"colleens"?

390
00:30:42,473 --> 00:30:45,476
We all know you're a sucker
for those irish girls.

391
00:30:45,977 --> 00:30:50,114
Every italian boy
bows down to the freckles.
I married you.

392
00:30:50,365 --> 00:30:54,869
- Yeah, i was a mother figure.
- Don't bust my balls with freud
by numbers, would ya?

393
00:30:54,986 --> 00:30:58,623
"Don't bust my balls"?
Watch it, richard.
Yourcalibrazeis showing.

394
00:30:58,623 --> 00:31:00,625
What, are you somehow
implying by all this...

395
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:03,628
i'm- i'm ashamed to be
an italian- american?

396
00:31:03,628 --> 00:31:06,130
With all the poverty,
starvation, ethnic cleansing...

397
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:08,633
and generally horrible shit
in this world,

398
00:31:09,133 --> 00:31:13,388
you devote your energies
to the protection of the dignity
of connie francis.

399
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:18,893
You know, you're all
worked up about my patient,

400
00:31:18,893 --> 00:31:23,398
a man who has no bearing
on who you are or where
you are in this world.

401
00:31:23,398 --> 00:31:26,517
Call him a patient.
The man's a criminal, jennifer.

402
00:31:26,517 --> 00:31:30,021
And after a while,
finally you're gonna get
beyond psychotherapy...

403
00:31:30,021 --> 00:31:32,523
with its cheesy
moral relativism.

404
00:31:32,523 --> 00:31:36,277
Finally, you're gonna get
to good and evil.
And he's evil.

405
00:31:58,433 --> 00:32:01,436
Sorry i'm late.
The alarm was--

406
00:32:01,436 --> 00:32:04,939
what the fuck is wrong with you?
Didn't paulie tell you
i ain't been feelin' good?

407
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,942
I wipe my ass
with your feelings.
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

408
00:32:08,443 --> 00:32:10,945
Drive the fuckin' car!

409
00:32:18,953 --> 00:32:22,457
We're under a microscope,
and i gotta hear you shot some
fuckin' civilian in the foot...

410
00:32:22,457 --> 00:32:24,959
'cause he made you wait
for buns?
Fuckin' paulie.

411
00:32:24,959 --> 00:32:27,962
Don't blame paulie!
Makazian comes to me
and says nutley p. D. S...

412
00:32:27,962 --> 00:32:29,964
got a description
and a make on the car!

413
00:32:30,465 --> 00:32:32,967
Why don't you just leave a
fuckin' urine sample next time?
If i could've done it--

414
00:32:33,468 --> 00:32:36,971
oh, shut up! Fuckin' georgie
comes into the club, he's got
vomit all over his shirt.

415
00:32:36,971 --> 00:32:40,475
I ask him,"what the fuck?" he
said you're diggin' up some body
you clipped three months ago!

416
00:32:40,975 --> 00:32:42,477
I was worried--
shut up!

417
00:32:42,977 --> 00:32:45,480
People do that shit,
they wanna get caught.
I wanna get caught?

418
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:48,483
You wanna get caught.
I seen it before,
this fuckin' "cowboy- itis"!

419
00:32:48,483 --> 00:32:51,486
You wanna be a big,
bad guy, christopher?
I was worried that i didn't--

420
00:32:51,486 --> 00:32:53,488
shut up!

421
00:32:58,743 --> 00:33:02,246
Can i try and explain here?

422
00:33:04,499 --> 00:33:07,502
I don't know, tony.

423
00:33:07,502 --> 00:33:11,506
It's like just the fuckin'
"regularness" of life is
too fuckin' hard for me.

424
00:33:11,506 --> 00:33:13,508
I don't--
i don't know.

425
00:33:19,013 --> 00:33:22,016
Look at you.

426
00:33:22,016 --> 00:33:25,019
I bet you're sleepin'
all the time, right?

427
00:33:25,019 --> 00:33:27,889
It's the only thing
i still enjoy.

428
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:31,392
You know what i think?

429
00:33:31,893 --> 00:33:35,396
Maybe i have cancer.

430
00:33:35,897 --> 00:33:37,899
You remember
how jackie got?

431
00:33:38,032 --> 00:33:39,534
Cancer?

432
00:33:39,901 --> 00:33:43,905
Somethin' fuckin' horrible's
goin' on inside my body.
There's a physical change.

433
00:33:44,038 --> 00:33:47,542
Does this word "cancer"
pop into your mind a lot,

434
00:33:47,542 --> 00:33:49,544
a little bit, what?

435
00:33:50,044 --> 00:33:55,550
- Huh?
- Well, i'm just thinkin'
maybe you're...

436
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:57,552
depressed.
Me?

437
00:33:57,668 --> 00:34:00,671
I'm no fuckin'
mental midget.

438
00:34:05,309 --> 00:34:07,311
All right.

439
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:11,432
- Watch the, the--
- what?

440
00:34:11,933 --> 00:34:13,935
The filter.
Oh, fuck!

441
00:34:24,946 --> 00:34:28,449
Maybe you got a, uh,
serotonin problem,

442
00:34:28,950 --> 00:34:32,453
or whatever the fuck
they call it, ya know.

443
00:34:32,453 --> 00:34:34,839
You know about that shit?

444
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,843
I saw it last night
on a...program.

445
00:34:38,843 --> 00:34:42,847
What, take fuckin' prozac?
Not this skinny guinea.

446
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:48,352
Let me ask you a question.

447
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:54,225
You ever think about,
uh, you know--

448
00:34:56,727 --> 00:34:58,729
fuck no!

449
00:35:00,231 --> 00:35:02,233
Good.

450
00:35:03,734 --> 00:35:08,239
Can you imagine those
fuckin' losers blowin' their
skulls all over the bathroom?

451
00:35:08,739 --> 00:35:10,741
It's fuckin' pathetic.

452
00:35:32,513 --> 00:35:36,017
Hey, didn't you hear
the goddamn doorbell?
I'm in the middle of a game.

453
00:35:36,017 --> 00:35:39,520
You'll be in the middle
of the fuckin' street
you don't wise up.

454
00:35:50,781 --> 00:35:52,783
Anthony soprano?

455
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:54,919
What are you doing
in my backyard?

456
00:35:55,036 --> 00:35:57,038
The gate was open.
I'm agent harris.

457
00:35:57,538 --> 00:36:01,042
This is agent driscol.
May we come in?
If i say no?

458
00:36:01,292 --> 00:36:04,295
If we were local,
we wouldn't even have knocked.

459
00:36:04,428 --> 00:36:06,931
What's your point?

460
00:36:07,048 --> 00:36:10,051
We have a search warrant.
We know you have children
in the house.

461
00:36:10,434 --> 00:36:12,937
Other team's waiting out front.
We don't think it necessary...

462
00:36:12,937 --> 00:36:15,056
to traumatize kids
by kicking in doors.

463
00:36:15,556 --> 00:36:19,060
So, why don't you take
a minute and tell them
you have, uh, visitors.

464
00:36:34,075 --> 00:36:36,077
Hmm.

465
00:36:43,467 --> 00:36:45,469
Any quarters,
you can keep.

466
00:36:45,469 --> 00:36:48,472
You tryin' to bribe me?

467
00:36:48,472 --> 00:36:51,475
Why don't you tell me
what you're lookin' for?
Maybe i can save you some time.

468
00:36:51,475 --> 00:36:54,478
- Any incriminating evidence
would be nice.
-

469
00:36:56,347 --> 00:36:58,349
dad!

470
00:36:58,733 --> 00:37:01,736
They're taking my computer.
I have an english paper.
You gotta be shittin' me.

471
00:37:01,852 --> 00:37:04,739
I better have all
my programs on there
when it comes back.

472
00:37:05,239 --> 00:37:07,241
Anthony.

473
00:37:07,241 --> 00:37:11,245
What the hell are they doin'
in my kitchen?

474
00:37:13,748 --> 00:37:16,367
What the hell are you doin'
in my refrigerator?

475
00:37:16,367 --> 00:37:19,870
- If you forgot your lunch box,
pal, why don't you just ask?
- I'm very sorry.

476
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:23,374
Mrs. Soprano, how much
would you say that bowl cost?
I'm not cleaning that up.

477
00:37:23,874 --> 00:37:25,876
Grasso, get somethin'
to clean that.

478
00:37:25,876 --> 00:37:28,379
Grasso--

479
00:37:28,879 --> 00:37:31,632
- your ass!
- Hey, hey, hey! Tony.

480
00:37:31,632 --> 00:37:33,634
Take it easy. Take it easy.
Grasso, take it easy.

481
00:37:34,018 --> 00:37:36,520
Tony, we're gonna be out
of here in a few minutes.

482
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:40,524
Tony, let's wait
in the living room.
Clean up the bowl.

483
00:37:40,524 --> 00:37:42,526
Come on.

484
00:37:50,785 --> 00:37:53,287
I know those feds are doin'
their job, but it pisses me off
the way they act.

485
00:37:53,287 --> 00:37:55,790
That one guy wasn't
so bad, harris.

486
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:59,794
Trust me, he was the biggest
sneak out of all of'em.
It's all part of his little act.

487
00:37:59,794 --> 00:38:02,296
And that guy
that broke the bowl,
he did that on purpose.

488
00:38:02,296 --> 00:38:04,799
I don't think so.
He was just a klutz.

489
00:38:04,799 --> 00:38:09,670
What was his last name?
Rizzo, razzo, what?
Grasso.

490
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:12,673
Grasso. Do you think
it's a coincidence
they sent him?

491
00:38:12,673 --> 00:38:16,177
If he wasn't an italian,
he'd be back at the office
sweepin' up. The stupid jerk.

492
00:38:16,677 --> 00:38:18,679
They probably frisk him
every night before he goes home.

493
00:38:18,679 --> 00:38:22,066
- Why?
- Why? 'cause he has a vowel
at the end of his name.

494
00:38:22,566 --> 00:38:27,071
Grasso. What's he think,
he's gonna make it to the top
by arresting his own people?

495
00:38:27,071 --> 00:38:29,690
Pass the mushu.
He'll see.

496
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:31,442
- He'll learn.
- We have a vowel.

497
00:38:31,942 --> 00:38:33,444
"F"- in' right,
and you be proud of it.

498
00:38:33,944 --> 00:38:37,948
Jesus christ, you'd think
there never was a michelangelo
the way they treat people.

499
00:38:38,082 --> 00:38:40,701
Did you know that an italian
invented the telephone?

500
00:38:40,701 --> 00:38:44,088
- Alexander graham bell
was italian?
- You see?

501
00:38:44,088 --> 00:38:47,958
You see what i'm talkin'--
antonio meucci invented the
telephone and he got robbed!

502
00:38:48,459 --> 00:38:50,961
Everybody knows that.

503
00:38:50,961 --> 00:38:53,464
Who invented the mafia?

504
00:38:53,464 --> 00:38:57,218
What?
La cosa nostra,
who invented that?

505
00:38:57,218 --> 00:38:59,603
- Who cares?
- Wasn't it salvatore lucana,

506
00:39:00,104 --> 00:39:04,475
better known as
charlie "lucky" luciano who
organized the five families?

507
00:39:04,608 --> 00:39:07,611
Lucchese, gambino,
bonnano, profaci.

508
00:39:07,862 --> 00:39:10,364
Is there somethin'
you wanna say to me?

509
00:39:11,615 --> 00:39:14,118
I just like history,
like you, dad.

510
00:39:14,235 --> 00:39:16,987
- Can you just shut
the fuck up about it?
- Hey!

511
00:39:17,121 --> 00:39:19,623
Hey!

512
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:24,745
A. J. , did you know that
john cabot was italian?
Whoa.

513
00:39:24,745 --> 00:39:28,249
- Like he knows who that is.
- It's the famous discoverer
of canada.

514
00:39:28,632 --> 00:39:31,135
The bank of america.
You ever heard of it?

515
00:39:31,135 --> 00:39:34,138
One of the biggest banks
in the world,
started by an italian.

516
00:39:34,505 --> 00:39:36,507
The first american saint
was italian-- mother cabrini.

517
00:39:37,007 --> 00:39:39,009
That's right.

518
00:39:39,009 --> 00:39:42,012
Is it true that the chinese
invented spaghetti?

519
00:39:42,012 --> 00:39:45,516
Now think about it.
Why would people
who eat with sticks...

520
00:39:45,516 --> 00:39:49,019
invent something that
you need a fork to eat?

521
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:51,522
And here's something else
i bet you didn't know.

522
00:39:51,522 --> 00:39:55,409
More italians fought for
this country in world war ii
than any other ethnic group.

523
00:39:57,161 --> 00:39:59,163
And they won't tell you about
sacco and vanzetti either.

524
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:02,032
The two antichrists
that got the electric chair
in massachusetts?

525
00:40:02,283 --> 00:40:05,035
- Anarchists.
- Isn't it antichrists?

526
00:40:05,286 --> 00:40:08,289
They were two innocent men
who got the chair
because they were italian.

527
00:40:08,789 --> 00:40:11,292
How can there be
two antichrists?
There was only one christ.

528
00:40:11,675 --> 00:40:14,795
- So?
- And of course,

529
00:40:15,296 --> 00:40:17,298
francis albert.

530
00:40:19,934 --> 00:40:23,437
Will i see you next week?
Unless you know somethin'
i don't.

531
00:40:23,437 --> 00:40:26,941
Just so you understand,
that i have to charge you
for the missed session.

532
00:40:27,308 --> 00:40:29,810
What are you talkin' about?

533
00:40:29,944 --> 00:40:31,946
We agreed on that
on our very first meeting.

534
00:40:32,446 --> 00:40:34,448
I know, but i just explained
to you my situation.

535
00:40:34,815 --> 00:40:38,319
I understand,
but it's important that
we respect the agreement.

536
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:43,073
- What if i got hit by a car?
- But you weren't.

537
00:40:43,574 --> 00:40:46,577
- I know, but what if?
- But you weren't.

538
00:40:46,827 --> 00:40:49,713
- I know that, but, but what if?
- You weren't.

539
00:40:49,830 --> 00:40:53,334
- Why don't you answer
my fuckin' question?
- I will not.

540
00:40:53,834 --> 00:40:55,836
You won't?

541
00:40:56,337 --> 00:40:58,339
All right, fine, fine.

542
00:40:58,839 --> 00:41:01,342
Here. Here you go.

543
00:41:01,342 --> 00:41:04,228
Of course, 'cause this is what
it's all about? Motherfuckin',
cocksuckin' money!

544
00:41:04,728 --> 00:41:06,730
Here.

545
00:41:08,232 --> 00:41:12,736
I don't understand that comment,
and i don't appreciate
being made to feel afraid.

546
00:41:12,987 --> 00:41:16,490
I don't appreciate feelin' like
i pour my heart out
to a fuckin' call girl.

547
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:19,610
- Is that how you see me?
- Not until now.

548
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:23,614
But it's obvious you don't
give a shit about my situation
or what's happenin' with me!

549
00:41:23,614 --> 00:41:26,617
Otherwise, you wouldn't
be shakin' me down.

550
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:31,622
It'll show as "paid"
on your next month's bill.

551
00:41:32,122 --> 00:41:35,125
Fine.
Stick it up your ass.

552
00:41:44,735 --> 00:41:47,054
And how about dr. Goldman
over here?

553
00:41:47,054 --> 00:41:51,058
Originally, he was gonna be
a tree surgeon, but he fainted
at the sight of sap.

554
00:41:51,058 --> 00:41:54,061
Sap, ladies and gentlemen.

555
00:41:54,562 --> 00:41:58,065
Pace yourselves.
Don't spend it all
in one place.

556
00:41:58,065 --> 00:42:02,570
Movie night, right?
Last week they showed
the polish version ofrashomon.

557
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:07,074
Everybody remembers
the rape exactly the same.
The'60s--

558
00:42:07,074 --> 00:42:09,577
what's the matter
with you, corrado?

559
00:42:09,577 --> 00:42:13,581
Headaches, that's all.
Not the kind you take
aspirin for.

560
00:42:14,081 --> 00:42:17,084
Now, tonight on our show,
we have mitzi gaynor,

561
00:42:17,084 --> 00:42:19,587
sergio franchi
and a woman from france...

562
00:42:19,587 --> 00:42:22,590
who will pull
a string of lightbulbs
out of her husband's throat.

563
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:24,592
This woman can relate.

564
00:42:24,842 --> 00:42:29,847
I think we may have
a bad apple.
Does tony know about this?

565
00:42:30,347 --> 00:42:34,852
What are you gonna do?
There's not much to do.
We have to sit back and wait.

566
00:42:34,852 --> 00:42:38,856
And do me a favor,
don't let tony know you know.
He's under enough pressure.

567
00:42:41,358 --> 00:42:45,362
I'm sure he's tellin'
his psychiatrist
it's all his mother's fault.

568
00:42:45,613 --> 00:42:50,751
- What are you talkin'
about, a psychiatrist?
- Yeah, a psychiatrist.

569
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:53,754
He's been seein' one
for a while now.

570
00:42:53,871 --> 00:42:57,625
God only knows what he says.

571
00:42:57,758 --> 00:43:00,761
- Tony?
- Yes, tony.

572
00:43:00,761 --> 00:43:04,265
Tony, who had
such a terrible mother.

573
00:43:04,265 --> 00:43:09,019
- A psychiatrist?
- Yes, junior.
For christ's sake!

574
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:14,024
Show of hands.
How many people think j. F. K.
Is still alive? Come on.

575
00:43:14,024 --> 00:43:16,527
They should take
a zapruder film
of your salad bar?

576
00:43:16,527 --> 00:43:19,029
Hello? Help me out.

577
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,782
Who?
The psychiatrist, i mean.

578
00:43:21,782 --> 00:43:23,784
Do you think i know?

579
00:43:24,285 --> 00:43:27,288
What did you say
to tony about this?
Me?

580
00:43:27,288 --> 00:43:31,792
Nothin'. I wouldn't give him
the satisfaction.

581
00:43:31,792 --> 00:43:36,914
And, junior, i don't want
there to be any repercussions.

582
00:43:38,415 --> 00:43:40,417
A psychiatrist?

583
00:43:40,801 --> 00:43:43,804
You're a broken record.

584
00:43:43,804 --> 00:43:45,806
Yes, yes.

585
00:43:45,806 --> 00:43:47,808
Shh.
Do i have to--

586
00:43:48,309 --> 00:43:52,313
this lady is blind. Dear,
i have a few words for you.

587
00:43:52,313 --> 00:43:55,816
Do i have to say it again?
They are lucy in the sky
with diamonds.

588
00:43:55,816 --> 00:43:58,936
All right?
Picture yourself in a boat
at ellis island.

589
00:43:58,936 --> 00:44:01,438
All right,
how does that sound?

590
00:44:05,442 --> 00:44:07,945
It's me. Leave a message.

591
00:44:07,945 --> 00:44:10,447
Christopher? It's mommy.

592
00:44:10,948 --> 00:44:12,950
I know you're there.
Pick it up.

593
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:16,954
Are you all right?
I'm worried about you.

594
00:44:16,954 --> 00:44:19,957
My god, they mentioned your name
in the newspaper today.

595
00:44:19,957 --> 00:44:23,460
Thestar- ledger.
Mrs. Jones told me.

596
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:25,963
With all those scumbags.

597
00:44:25,963 --> 00:44:29,967
It's been a while
since we met for therapy.

598
00:44:29,967 --> 00:44:31,969
Mm- hmm.

599
00:44:31,969 --> 00:44:34,972
Jason, how's bard?

600
00:44:37,474 --> 00:44:40,477
I'm moving into
a smoke- free dorm.

601
00:44:43,981 --> 00:44:45,983
And how do we feel
about that?

602
00:44:46,233 --> 00:44:48,736
I'm more interested
in discussing what
we mentioned before.

603
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:53,123
Jason, are you concerned
that your mother is treating
this patient x?

604
00:44:54,241 --> 00:44:56,744
I don't care.

605
00:44:57,244 --> 00:45:02,249
As a colleague, jen,
i suggest you drop the patient.

606
00:45:02,383 --> 00:45:05,753
After her
last encounter with him,
she finally acknowledged...

607
00:45:05,753 --> 00:45:09,256
that she saw the different side
of him-- the subhuman.

608
00:45:09,506 --> 00:45:11,759
I take it you were frightened.

609
00:45:11,759 --> 00:45:14,261
Frightened, revolted.

610
00:45:14,645 --> 00:45:16,146
At long last,
appropriate emotions.

611
00:45:16,647 --> 00:45:19,149
Oh, for christ's sake, richard.
You too, sam.

612
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:24,021
- When did we become so afraid
to get our hands dirty?
- It's what she gets paid for.

613
00:45:24,021 --> 00:45:27,024
Jason, how would you like
to see your mother--

614
00:45:29,026 --> 00:45:33,030
never mind.
I'm not gonna paint
any graphic images.

615
00:45:33,414 --> 00:45:35,916
See?
He always does that.

616
00:45:36,417 --> 00:45:40,421
- What?
- Follow that up, jas.
Dad does what?

617
00:45:40,921 --> 00:45:43,924
His real issue is that
i should distance myself
from this man...

618
00:45:43,924 --> 00:45:46,927
on the grounds of the stigma
that he brings us.

619
00:45:47,044 --> 00:45:50,547
I say, refer this patient
to a therapist...

620
00:45:51,048 --> 00:45:54,551
that specializes
in mafia depression.

621
00:45:58,555 --> 00:46:01,058
- Sam, this isn't funny.
- No, of course not.

622
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:05,562
Jen has a real honest
to goodness personal...

623
00:46:06,063 --> 00:46:08,699
and professional dilemma.

624
00:46:11,819 --> 00:46:16,457
You know,
on my mother's side
we have a few dark sheep.

625
00:46:16,457 --> 00:46:18,459
Excuse me?

626
00:46:18,959 --> 00:46:20,461
Lepke.

627
00:46:24,965 --> 00:46:26,967
Who's lepke?

628
00:46:26,967 --> 00:46:30,471
Louis lepke buchalter.

629
00:46:30,471 --> 00:46:33,841
You know.
Murder incorporated.

630
00:46:36,226 --> 00:46:39,229
My mother's uncle
was lepke's wheel man.

631
00:46:39,229 --> 00:46:41,231
His driver.

632
00:46:42,733 --> 00:46:44,985
Uh- huh.

633
00:46:44,985 --> 00:46:47,488
Those were some tough jews.

634
