2
00:01:44,904 --> 00:01:49,398
Here, I made it with a lot of milk and sugar.
It's more comforting that way.

3
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:54,775
You sure you don't want some eggs
or an English or something?

4
00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:57,411
You're coming back?

5
00:01:58,251 --> 00:02:01,118
I hope so. Immigration, they make problems.

6
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:03,355
Maybe Tony can help with that.

7
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,116
Yeah.

8
00:02:05,658 --> 00:02:09,150
What are you doing here?
I thought you were flying out to Naples.

9
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:11,789
I just dropped off these shirts
from Patsy's guy.

10
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:14,390
But you should be on your way
to see your old man.

11
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:16,264
Cancer is everywhere in his body.

12
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:18,133
Cancer don't respect nothing.

13
00:02:18,204 --> 00:02:21,503
- You know, it started in his guts.
- Do you need any money?

14
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:24,171
I'm good.

15
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:26,670
Please call and let us know.

16
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:30,543
I'm sorry, Tony.

17
00:02:30,783 --> 00:02:33,411
You'll have to get somebody else
to drive you tonight.

18
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:35,147
Not a problem. Go.

19
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:40,249
You think he wears a bag?

20
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,055
Who wears what?

21
00:02:42,128 --> 00:02:43,993
You know, a colostomy bag.

22
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:47,189
- Furio's old man.
- How the fuck would I know that?

23
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:51,431
Because my ma, maybe, maybe not,
has to get one.

24
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:53,335
Could we not talk about this?

25
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:55,772
We could talk about any topic you like, T.

26
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:56,934
Good.

27
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:01,109
It's just that now with Ma all squared away
to go to Green Grove...

28
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:04,639
For fuck's sake, Paulie,
everybody's gonna get old and die.

29
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:12,653
- Am I driving you tomorrow, too?
- No, I'll drive myself.

30
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:13,987
I got nothing else to do.

31
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,460
I got a very important meeting, that's all.

32
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:18,497
It's a delicate situation.

33
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:25,833
We lucked out with the weather.

34
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,641
So, how's the life of leisure?

35
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:31,667
Playing golf, ain't I?

36
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,945
Cocksucker.

37
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:44,185
Seriously, it's good you're pulling back
business-wise like we agreed.

38
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:46,115
My nephew, I told him.

39
00:03:46,192 --> 00:03:49,628
I'm gonna be speaking through him,
and only through him, as time passes.

40
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:51,323
- Good.
- Plus Sil.

41
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:56,000
I don't want to celebrate
my daughter's first kid in prison.

42
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:05,470
All right, this sit-down in Perth Amboy.
Get a pen and paper.

43
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:06,739
Hold on.

44
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:13,745
<i>I can't find a piece of paper.</i>

45
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:17,011
Shoot.

46
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:20,753
Tell Paulie to let Patsy run the car operation
while Furio's gone.

47
00:04:20,827 --> 00:04:22,658
<i>Tel Patsy he's got to kick up 10 points.</i>

48
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:25,425
<i>Seven and a half to me,
two and half to Paulie.</i>

49
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:26,522
Got it.

50
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:30,057
You and Sil, you figure out
who pays the Longshore Union how much.

51
00:04:30,136 --> 00:04:32,161
I'll back you up whichever.

52
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:35,137
What the fuck?

53
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:38,071
<i>- I'm on it.
- All right.</i>

54
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:12,567
- A simple yes or no will do.
- Please.

55
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:18,513
- Artie, hi, how are things?
- Fine.

56
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:21,051
Did they ever catch those muggers?

57
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:24,482
Did you leave room for dessert?

58
00:05:24,557 --> 00:05:28,323
We'll have one zabaglione and four spoons.
Coffees, all around.

59
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:33,991
Bri', can I ask you
a financial-related question?

60
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:36,331
The last thing the guy wants to do
is talk shop.

61
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:39,530
Ask him anything you want.
It's all he likes to talk about.

62
00:05:39,605 --> 00:05:40,936
It's no big thing.

63
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:43,407
Any ideas on what Tony and I should do...

64
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:46,206
with the proceeds
from the property in Newark we sold?

65
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:47,746
- A HUD?
- What?

66
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:51,876
Kid loves Paul Newman movies.
No more grappa for you.

67
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:53,608
You know what I'm talking about.

68
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,813
Uncle Junior's lot on Frelinghuysen Avenue.

69
00:05:55,888 --> 00:05:58,516
Yeah, that. It all went into the trust.

70
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:02,522
T- bills, I was able to lock you in
before the rates dropped.

71
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:06,124
What doesn't this kid know about money?

72
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:08,462
You know, I trust him 1,000 percent?

73
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,601
Thank you.

74
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:16,672
- We have so many more of the newborn size.
- I think they're cheaper.

75
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,607
Next year we could put a notice
in the bulletin...

76
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:23,137
that people whose last names
begin with "A" to "K" bring the newborns...

77
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:26,481
and "L" to "Z" bring the bigger ones,
or vice versa.

78
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:30,215
Whatever we give them, the girls
at our ladies' shelter should be grateful.

79
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:33,452
I mean, nobody told them
to go and have babies without husbands.

80
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:40,264
I remember his charity toward my family
when Jack died.

81
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,801
I didn't know how to pay the phone bill.
Jackie always did everything.

82
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,735
- There you go.
- Thank you.

83
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:47,534
I pay bills...

84
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:51,102
but other than that, it's the same with Tony.

85
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:53,708
Try to find out where the money is...

86
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,613
how much we have,
and I get such resistance.

87
00:06:56,749 --> 00:07:00,185
I didn't know what we had
until after I buried Jackie.

88
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:02,150
Was it enough?

89
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:04,782
Sort of.

90
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:07,520
Not really.

91
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:11,121
How much is enough, anyway?

92
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:13,823
I don't know, that's my point.

93
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,959
Doesn't anything ever change?

94
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:18,434
Women are supposed to be
partners nowadays.

95
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:21,803
I'm not a feminist,
I'm not saying 50-50, but Jesus.

96
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:25,711
<i>You know, I put up with cumare shit.
Pardon my French.</i>

97
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:28,639
I made my peace with it,
best I could, anyway.

98
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:31,046
Isn't your cousin Brian
handling your money now?

99
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:34,553
The big things, the investments.
He's doing well, too.

100
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:37,554
You know,
I do have to give Tony credit there.

101
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:39,784
He did meet me halfway with that,
God bless him.

102
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:41,759
Which was a very big step for him, I know.

103
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:44,888
- Maybe you have nothing to worry about.
- I don't know.

104
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:48,092
Tony pulls people into his circle.
I don't know what to think.

105
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:51,133
Good girl.

106
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:53,966
Titanium?

107
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:57,405
The track's freezing up,
it's too hard for aluminum.

108
00:07:58,077 --> 00:08:01,535
Whatever she's got on those feet,
she's a winner.

109
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:04,374
A little colicky?

110
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:09,216
You don't feel good, baby girl?
You bad girl.

111
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:11,620
Fuck this horse-whispering shit.

112
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:18,359
What is this costing us?

113
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:20,765
Tony, Valentina.

114
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:26,427
She works in an art gallery.
Helping me to enlarge my collection.

115
00:08:28,474 --> 00:08:31,671
And this, my chiquita banana, is Pie-O-My.

116
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:33,272
She's beautiful.

117
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:36,975
There's no stopping this horse.
She's gonna go all the way to the Breeders'.

118
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:39,540
We'll do the two geldings next.

119
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:43,248
Hon, can you come here a sec?
I think I have something in my eye.

120
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,250
Let Dr. Ralphie have a look.

121
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:53,960
- I don't see anything.
- Maybe you need more light.

122
00:08:58,237 --> 00:08:59,465
What the fuck?

123
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:03,933
- I can't believe you did this to me.
- It was a joke, hon.

124
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,341
There's nothing funny about it.

125
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:06,901
There is from where I'm standing.

126
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:08,742
Besides, it's good luck.

127
00:09:09,615 --> 00:09:12,709
- What?
- It's good luck to step in horseshit.

128
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:15,250
- Ask any horse person.
- It's true.

129
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:17,516
Then why aren't you people
walking around...

130
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,854
looking for piles of horseshit
to stomp around in?

131
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:23,487
- It only works if it's an accident.
- Fucking sick, all of you.

132
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:25,560
Fucko, where's a hose?

133
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:37,441
You know, it can be risky trusting him
to have a sense of humor.

134
00:09:37,543 --> 00:09:38,874
Did you think it was funny?

135
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:42,506
Yeah, but what I think is funny
is what an 8-year-old boy thinks is funny.

136
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,482
Having any fun yourself?

137
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:46,612
What, you taking a survey?

138
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:49,553
- Have any interest in art?
- Show the right thing, I do.

139
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:52,819
There's an artist down in New Hope,
specializes in horses.

140
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:55,656
Give him a photo of your horse,
he paints a lovely portrait.

141
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:57,161
It'd look great in your office.

142
00:09:57,229 --> 00:09:59,629
Have a look at my office
before you make that call.

143
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:00,723
Think about it.

144
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,394
If you're interested, give me a call.

145
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:09,235
"La Paz. " What's that, Puerto Rican?

146
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:12,775
<i>Cubana. My mother was Italian,
my father Cuban.</i>

147
00:10:12,845 --> 00:10:14,904
What a dangerous combination.

148
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:23,681
She gorgeous or what?

149
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:25,520
Sweet as sugar.

150
00:10:29,595 --> 00:10:32,826
If there's anything you need,
you just press this button.

151
00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:35,662
- Which one?
- This one that I'm showing you.

152
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:37,265
Safety first.

153
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:39,463
A friend of yours, Mrs. Cirillo,
might stop by.

154
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:42,098
She wanted to see you
before you went down for lunch.

155
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:43,471
Cookie.

156
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:51,078
Look, just like home.

157
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:54,184
They're gonna wait on you hand and foot
around here.

158
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,645
Put the boxes in the closet.

159
00:10:56,722 --> 00:10:59,452
And go get the TV. The both of you carry it.

160
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:02,389
Come on, cowgirl.

161
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:06,022
Let's go down to the chuck wagon
and see what they're rustling up.

162
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:11,960
- Paulie, did they bring my bathmat?
- For the fifth time, Ma, yes.

163
00:11:13,472 --> 00:11:15,940
Look who's here to make you feel at home.

164
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:19,802
- Are you here, too?
- Not yet, but it's all paid for.

165
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:21,642
I'm gonna move in after my hip surgery.

166
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:24,911
Minn comes twice a week for lunch,
in the meantime.

167
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:26,815
She's one of the girls.

168
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:29,114
Look how you've grown up, Paulie.

169
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,247
I know. I don't understand.

170
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:34,119
When I was a kid, you two were old ladies.

171
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:36,889
Now I'm old, and you two are still old.

172
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:40,291
So, how's Chucky doing, anyway?
Still teaching?

173
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:43,893
He's been the high-school principal
for the last 10 years or so.

174
00:11:43,969 --> 00:11:45,129
Bergen North.

175
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:48,401
- He must give you a lot of happiness.
- Except for that wife of his.

176
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:52,171
- All you ever been was nice to her.
- I know that.

177
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:56,213
- Come on, girls, I'll take you to lunch.
- I got to use the WC.

178
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,676
She just went 10 minutes ago.

179
00:11:59,518 --> 00:12:02,146
I don't want to embarrass your mother
in the dining room.

180
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:03,711
So make sure she knows...

181
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:07,486
she can't sit with me and Minn,
and our other girls.

182
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:10,785
- What are you talking about?
- We're a set group.

183
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:13,730
We eat together,
we play Scrabble for money...

184
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:16,562
and there's really no room at either table.

185
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:18,629
Come on now, Cook.

186
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:21,302
I know you girls can work it out.

187
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:31,948
- Fucking amazing.
- This is how simple it is to change inputs.

188
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:36,248
Listen to that imaging in stereo mode.

189
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:38,790
It's like Clapton's sitting right there
at your house.

190
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:57,636
Great, huh?

191
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:02,642
We can all watch movies as a family now.
And listen to that.

192
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:07,176
I think it's great. I'm going food shopping.

193
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:09,346
<i>Maybe I'll get In the Bedroom.</i>

194
00:13:09,421 --> 00:13:12,413
- What time you want me to wake you up?
- The movie.

195
00:13:14,226 --> 00:13:16,660
Yeah. Good.

196
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:18,088
Have fun.

197
00:13:53,098 --> 00:13:55,430
<i>- Helo?
- Mr. Wal, please.</i>

198
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:01,465
<i>- Yeah, can you talk?
- Yeah, I'm on a hotel phone.</i>

199
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,006
<i>So, how are you? What's going on?</i>

200
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:07,743
<i>I found him, Chuck.
I found the man who kiled Helen.</i>

201
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,113
<i>- What?
- It was me they were after.</i>

202
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:12,650
<i>Who are they?</i>

203
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:16,420
<i>Devlin MacGregor and Lentz.</i>

204
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:20,315
<i>Lentz was supervising
the protocol for RDU-90.</i>

205
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:24,226
<i>He knew I found out it was causing
liver damage. It was Lentz.</i>

206
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:28,266
<i>Lentz is dead.</i>

207
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:30,697
<i>What? How?</i>

208
00:14:31,136 --> 00:14:33,764
<i>He died in a car accident last summer.</i>

209
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,144
<i>Can you prove this about the drug?</i>

210
00:14:40,412 --> 00:14:42,039
<i>Yeah, I think so.</i>

211
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:45,079
<i>I need your help, Chuck.</i>

212
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:48,642
<i>Cal Bones at the hospital.
Tel him to give me whatever help I need.</i>

213
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,712
Beautiful looking animal.

214
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,215
Great definition, carriage.

215
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:58,490
- I'd love to paint her.
- Good.

216
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:02,093
But what about this deadbeat?

217
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:04,661
There's no problem cropping you both out.

218
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:07,638
We could set her in front of the rail
at the track as she is.

219
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:11,665
Or if you'd prefer something more pastoral,
we can place her in a meadow.

220
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:15,544
I don't know about that, but can you
leave me in there and just crop him out?

221
00:15:15,614 --> 00:15:19,106
Easy. And frankly, it would be better,
composition-wise.

222
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:22,220
Go for the pastoral, much more dignified.

223
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:24,017
And it comes framed?

224
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:27,615
Exactly as you see that one. $6,500.

225
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,421
All right, you got a deal.

226
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:38,192
- To Pie-O-Mine.
- My.

227
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:42,332
- Your what?
- No, the name, it's Pie-O-My.

228
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:50,681
I'll give you the whole thing now.

229
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:56,111
There.

230
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:59,782
I'd better get your receipt.
I'll just be a minute.

231
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:07,525
<i>Let's not forget
to drink to the beautiful seסorita...</i>

232
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:09,863
whose idea this was in the first place.

233
00:16:09,935 --> 00:16:13,666
- I bet you say that to all the girls.
- There's not that many.

234
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:17,902
And truthfully, the ones that there are,
they don't got many ideas.

235
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:21,569
We should probably
start heading back soon.

236
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:23,006
Yeah.

237
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:27,318
If you want, on the way,
we can stop and eat something.

238
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:29,013
Yeah, we could definitely stop.

239
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:35,954
- Like that.
- So good.

240
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:38,519
- Just like that.
- Yeah, that's so good.

241
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:06,550
Let me up.

242
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:40,054
You can see cows from in there.

243
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:43,026
Sit down and eat before it gets any colder.

244
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:56,505
- Looks good, doesn't it?
- Mine needed salt.

245
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:03,041
Jesus fucking Christ,
these fucking hicks can't even get this right.

246
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:09,886
You did this?

247
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:12,184
That's very mature.

248
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:15,317
It's not funny.

249
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:17,658
I thought you had
an 8-year-old's sense of humor.

250
00:18:17,729 --> 00:18:19,924
Come here and give me a kiss.

251
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,531
I'm eating.

252
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:28,102
Not anymore, you're not.

253
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:35,040
What if I promise to be good?

254
00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:37,476
How good?

255
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:40,543
Good.

256
00:18:52,397 --> 00:18:54,365
Shit, I lost a nail.

257
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:04,006
We will not be mentioning
anything about any of this to Ralph.

258
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:09,809
I'll take it.
Can you send it to this person here?

259
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:12,740
Sure. You want to include a card with this?

260
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:28,628
Let me have another one.

261
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:42,039
Round and round she goes,
where she stops, nobody knows.

262
00:19:42,114 --> 00:19:44,309
Place your bets, be a winner.

263
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:50,515
- I'll take another card.
- Are you sure, dear?

264
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:57,026
For the love of God, Nucci,
how could you hit on 18?

265
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:01,728
Give me another one.

266
00:20:03,835 --> 00:20:05,894
That should've been my card!

267
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:08,166
I could've had 21.

268
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,631
I was hoping for a three.

269
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:14,478
I'm not sure you understand the fine points.

270
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:18,140
Maybe you ought to play roulette.
It's right over there.

271
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:26,658
Round and round she goes,
where she stops, nobody knows.

272
00:21:03,528 --> 00:21:05,519
Goddamn it, Tony!

273
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:19,200
You did that to me on our honeymoon.

274
00:21:19,311 --> 00:21:22,872
I didn't like it then, and I made you
promise me you'd never do it again.

275
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:25,576
- It's just a little cold water.
- It's really unpleasant.

276
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:27,141
Do you remember promising me?

277
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:30,211
- You can do it back to me.
- I don't want to do it back to you.

278
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,780
- Why not? It's fun.
- Do you remember promising me?

279
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:34,883
- Yeah, so what?
- So...

280
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:38,062
This is one promise
I would like you to keep.

281
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:43,729
Whatever.

282
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:06,985
This can't be Paulie.

283
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:08,321
Chucky?

284
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:11,920
Come here, you
pizza-face-son-of-a-son-of-a-gun you.

285
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:15,797
Oh, God. Mr. Van Kowenberg,
what did we say about those shoes?

286
00:22:16,068 --> 00:22:19,196
The laces are in my locker,
I was gonna get them after study hall.

287
00:22:19,271 --> 00:22:20,568
Get them now.

288
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,602
Come on, Paulie.

289
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:33,116
Hard to believe it's been so long.

290
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,511
This is for you.

291
00:22:37,622 --> 00:22:41,388
That's a nice gesture, Paul, but I really can't.

292
00:22:41,593 --> 00:22:44,619
Go on, I got lots of them.
You can't insult me.

293
00:22:49,668 --> 00:22:52,068
- No more glasses?
- I had the Lasik.

294
00:22:52,437 --> 00:22:55,895
- And your face cleared up pretty good, too?
- Cleared up in 10th grade.

295
00:22:55,974 --> 00:22:58,636
See, there you go. Ninth was my last.

296
00:23:06,184 --> 00:23:09,585
So, did your mom tell you
I saw her over at Green Grove?

297
00:23:09,654 --> 00:23:11,918
Apparently, she sees
quite a bit of your mother.

298
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:15,016
That's just it, Chucky.
They're both residents.

299
00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:17,618
But there seems to be an exclusion.

300
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:19,387
I don't blame your mother.

301
00:23:19,464 --> 00:23:22,592
I blame that Minn Matrone.
She's a malignant cunt.

302
00:23:24,936 --> 00:23:26,767
Excuse me for saying so.

303
00:23:26,838 --> 00:23:29,568
She eggs your mother on,
and she don't even live there.

304
00:23:29,641 --> 00:23:31,233
I'm not sure I understand.

305
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:33,504
I'm just asking you to talk to your ma.

306
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:36,638
See if she can include my ma more
with the group.

307
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:39,381
It won't do much good.

308
00:23:39,718 --> 00:23:41,948
Now, you know how these old gals are.

309
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:44,648
All I'm trying to do is pay my ma back...

310
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:47,248
for when I was a kid
and got into so much trouble.

311
00:23:47,325 --> 00:23:50,317
She went to bat for me how many times?
With the nuns.

312
00:23:50,395 --> 00:23:53,057
With the store owners up and down
13th Street.

313
00:23:53,131 --> 00:23:56,032
And let's face it, Chucky, with the cops.

314
00:23:58,236 --> 00:24:00,101
For all the bad I did.

315
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:03,674
I'm still capable if I don't watch myself.

316
00:24:03,742 --> 00:24:06,506
But with all of that, she always had my back.

317
00:24:09,881 --> 00:24:13,339
I'll talk to my ma, see what she says.
But like I said...

318
00:24:13,852 --> 00:24:17,549
- Whatever you can do.
- All right. Take care.

319
00:24:54,192 --> 00:24:57,252
Ale was always served in pints and quarts.

320
00:24:57,662 --> 00:25:01,723
So, "Mind your p's and q's,"
means "Watch your alcohol consumption. "

321
00:25:02,868 --> 00:25:04,563
I'll be right back.

322
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:08,070
Holy cow.
So there's an origin for everything.

323
00:25:09,407 --> 00:25:11,534
- What's up?
- A little business.

324
00:25:12,878 --> 00:25:15,438
- Like what?
- Why? You want to hear this?

325
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:22,252
We decided to give a bigger percentage
to the union guys than the customs guys.

326
00:25:22,487 --> 00:25:25,650
You're shitting me, right?
That's what you guys came up with?

327
00:25:25,724 --> 00:25:27,214
Everybody seemed pleased.

328
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:29,192
Damn it, now I'll have to go down there...

329
00:25:29,261 --> 00:25:32,389
and do a go-see with everybody,
from the harbormaster on down...

330
00:25:32,464 --> 00:25:35,058
which is exactly what I was trying to avoid.

331
00:25:35,433 --> 00:25:37,799
You want it renegotiated,
that's what we'll do.

332
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:39,803
Don't make me go down to Perth Amboy.

333
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:43,602
I'm trying to free myself up
to do a little global thinking.

334
00:25:44,409 --> 00:25:45,569
Right.

335
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:59,084
- So, girls, what's it gonna be?
- I'll have what I always have.

336
00:25:59,658 --> 00:26:02,957
Chicken Mario? 15 years of Chicken Mario.

337
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:05,222
Can't you try the veal chop or something?

338
00:26:05,297 --> 00:26:07,788
Why are you giving me a hard time?
I like the chicken.

339
00:26:07,866 --> 00:26:10,562
- Hello, beautiful people.
- Look who it is.

340
00:26:10,635 --> 00:26:12,000
Hi, how are you?

341
00:26:12,304 --> 00:26:15,330
- Remember Valentina?
- Yeah, nice to see you again.

342
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:16,567
Yeah, same here.

343
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:19,166
You the one
who pulled that horseshit stunt?

344
00:26:21,646 --> 00:26:23,841
We're gonna have some steaks.

345
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:26,914
- Maybe I'll have a steak.
- You don't need a steak.

346
00:26:26,985 --> 00:26:29,818
- I know I don't need a steak.
- Do me a favor.

347
00:26:30,121 --> 00:26:32,453
Don't fuck with the salt shaker.

348
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:37,994
- You like the sole?
- The scampi for me.

349
00:26:40,332 --> 00:26:42,061
I don't know, give me...

350
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,361
Come on, you're getting anorexic.

351
00:26:44,636 --> 00:26:47,696
I'm gonna make a call. Okay?

352
00:26:47,906 --> 00:26:51,171
You're wasting away.
Come on, what are you gonna do?

353
00:26:54,379 --> 00:26:55,471
Here.

354
00:26:57,515 --> 00:27:00,348
- No, you keep it.
- I don't want your consolation prize.

355
00:27:00,418 --> 00:27:03,012
I bet you have a standing order
at the jewelry store.

356
00:27:03,088 --> 00:27:06,421
- I gotta be getting back to my table.
- What, to the blonde out there?

357
00:27:06,491 --> 00:27:09,858
Does she fuck you better than me?
Suck your dick better than me?

358
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:18,625
Come on.

359
00:27:25,877 --> 00:27:28,937
Really, Tony, just tell me.
How come I can't see you again?

360
00:27:29,014 --> 00:27:31,710
- Because you fuck Ralph.
- You got morals all of a sudden?

361
00:27:31,783 --> 00:27:33,808
I don't know about morals,
but I do got rules.

362
00:27:33,885 --> 00:27:37,116
Some dago macho bullshit about
"Don't fuck your friend's girlfriend"?

363
00:27:37,188 --> 00:27:38,553
Yeah, that.

364
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:41,220
- But not just that.
- Then what?

365
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:49,367
Look, that day in the countryside,
that was...

366
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:53,729
- It was great.
- Did I do something wrong? I'll fix it.

367
00:27:53,805 --> 00:27:56,638
No, you can't fix the shit I'm talking about.

368
00:27:59,244 --> 00:28:01,542
I don't wanna be
where Ralph Cifaretto has been.

369
00:28:01,613 --> 00:28:02,602
You prick!

370
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:06,117
A one-time thing is one thing,
but to get into a relationship...

371
00:28:07,118 --> 00:28:08,710
I gotta get back to my dinner.

372
00:28:09,387 --> 00:28:12,584
You don't know anything.
Let me tell you what's really going on.

373
00:28:12,724 --> 00:28:13,986
He doesn't fuck me.

374
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:17,460
I swear to God,
he's some kind of freak or something.

375
00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:20,159
- You two don't have sex?
- No.

376
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:24,731
- Sort of yeah, but not...
- All right, have a nice life.

377
00:28:24,936 --> 00:28:26,597
Go ahead.

378
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:30,332
You go back first. I'll wait a minute.
We shouldn't go back together.

379
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:40,348
- Everything come out all right?
- Yeah.

380
00:30:12,844 --> 00:30:15,938
- It's me, Valentina.
- You got no reason to be calling me.

381
00:30:16,181 --> 00:30:17,944
I have to tell you everything.

382
00:30:18,016 --> 00:30:22,180
I mean, I didn't want to tell you before,
because it's just so embarrassing.

383
00:30:22,253 --> 00:30:23,277
Where are you?

384
00:30:23,354 --> 00:30:25,379
<i>- I'm at Ralph's.
- Oh, Christ!</i>

385
00:30:25,456 --> 00:30:27,151
No, it's okay.

386
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:29,482
He left.

387
00:30:31,095 --> 00:30:34,587
Ralph does not have sex like other people,
regular people.

388
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,594
It's all some kind of kinky shit.
Believe me, I am not hung-up.

389
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,230
I've done a lot. I've done girls...

390
00:30:41,306 --> 00:30:43,103
<i>I've done threesomes, and I've done...</i>

391
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:45,699
<i>- With him?
- No, Tony, please, just listen.</i>

392
00:30:45,944 --> 00:30:48,242
Ralph is loco. For real, okay?

393
00:30:48,613 --> 00:30:51,241
<i>He just makes me do stuff,
not realy even sexual.</i>

394
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:55,178
Like last night I just wanted him to fuck me,
just so I can get back at you.

395
00:30:55,253 --> 00:30:58,484
But all he wanted me to do
was drip candle wax on his balls...

396
00:30:58,556 --> 00:31:01,024
<i>then he went into the bathroom
and jerked himself off.</i>

397
00:31:01,092 --> 00:31:03,424
Now, I don't call that
having sex with someone.

398
00:31:03,494 --> 00:31:05,257
Oh, Jesus H. Christ.

399
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:07,195
<i>Last week, I swear to God...</i>

400
00:31:07,265 --> 00:31:10,029
he told me to rub his dick raw
with a cheese grater.

401
00:31:10,101 --> 00:31:12,296
<i>- Get the fuck out of here.
- I wouldn't do it!</i>

402
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:14,304
I told him to fuck off.

403
00:31:16,241 --> 00:31:17,572
<i>My accountant is here.</i>

404
00:31:18,142 --> 00:31:20,872
<i>- Wil you cal me?
- I gotta go.</i>

405
00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:26,281
Mozzarella?

406
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,653
Let me ask you a question.

407
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:34,385
You think Ralph's
a little weird about women?

408
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:36,388
I don't know, Ton'.

409
00:31:37,095 --> 00:31:40,531
I mean, he beat one to death just for...

410
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:44,694
I forget. What was it again?

411
00:31:45,203 --> 00:31:48,138
- Maybe you're feeling guilty.
- I don't see that.

412
00:31:50,808 --> 00:31:51,797
Why would I?

413
00:31:52,443 --> 00:31:55,276
Because he's a friend of yours,
and you're cuckolding him.

414
00:31:56,681 --> 00:31:59,809
Cuckolding is when a man has an affair
with another's wife.

415
00:31:59,884 --> 00:32:02,011
<i>She's not his wife anyway.
She's his cumare.</i>

416
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:05,715
<i>- And therefore has no status whatever.
- Cumares have status.</i>

417
00:32:06,357 --> 00:32:09,849
I mean, it's not like in the old days,
when a man had a wife...

418
00:32:09,961 --> 00:32:12,020
and then sort of a second wife.

419
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:15,031
Used to be the men would take out
their wives on Fridays...

420
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:17,124
<i>and their cumares on Saturdays.</i>

421
00:32:17,201 --> 00:32:19,169
Or maybe it's the other way around.

422
00:32:19,971 --> 00:32:22,735
Anyway, when I came up,
it wasn't so formal.

423
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:26,903
Business associate of mine's
got two full families.

424
00:32:27,145 --> 00:32:29,579
One up here, one down in Sea Girt.

425
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:33,216
And his second wife busts his balls
identical to the first.

426
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:35,718
Sounds like a complicated arrangement.

427
00:32:37,322 --> 00:32:40,223
- I'm afraid our time is up.
- Just give me another minute.

428
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:42,759
- I have a patient waiting.
- Well, let him wait.

429
00:32:42,827 --> 00:32:44,920
You make me wait out there all the time.

430
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:49,964
I just wanna ask you if it's possible
for a man to go out with a woman...

431
00:32:50,401 --> 00:32:52,665
without really doing anything with them.

432
00:32:52,737 --> 00:32:55,763
- You'll have to be more specific.
- He likes them to hurt him.

433
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:57,835
And that's it.

434
00:32:59,344 --> 00:33:01,175
And then he goes and he...

435
00:33:02,246 --> 00:33:05,044
takes care of himself, his own needs.

436
00:33:06,017 --> 00:33:08,383
He sounds like a textbook masochist.

437
00:33:08,586 --> 00:33:10,918
- Like S & M?
- The "M" part, yes.

438
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:15,626
I thought all that stuff
was just like a run-up to the act.

439
00:33:15,927 --> 00:33:17,792
That's the case for many people.

440
00:33:17,895 --> 00:33:20,420
But not for people with paraphilias.

441
00:33:21,232 --> 00:33:24,201
For them, receiving pain, being humiliated...

442
00:33:24,268 --> 00:33:28,204
becomes, in and of itself, the sexual release.

443
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:31,800
Like many other things,
we believe it's rooted in childhood.

444
00:33:33,444 --> 00:33:36,470
- We can continue this next week.
- Just one more second.

445
00:33:36,781 --> 00:33:39,375
I received regular beatings
when I was a kid...

446
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:41,814
but I'm not going around
looking for some woman...

447
00:33:41,886 --> 00:33:44,377
to hook up jumper cables
to my private parts.

448
00:33:44,455 --> 00:33:46,480
It's not a simple one-to-one.

449
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:50,555
More than likely,
he had a controlling and punishing mother.

450
00:33:50,795 --> 00:33:53,821
She loved him,
but showed it only in connection...

451
00:33:53,898 --> 00:33:57,857
with some sort of violent or abusive act.

452
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:01,369
Is everything about everybody
really about their mothers?

453
00:34:05,576 --> 00:34:07,544
All right, back to the other thing.

454
00:34:08,112 --> 00:34:10,979
For a guy like that,
he's going out with a woman...

455
00:34:11,816 --> 00:34:15,308
he could technically not have
penisary contact with her vulva.

456
00:34:15,653 --> 00:34:18,986
It sounds like you're asking me
for personal information...

457
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:20,490
I really can't give you.

458
00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:38,536
Good morning, Pickwick Framing.

459
00:34:41,546 --> 00:34:42,604
Hello?

460
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:56,883
<i>It's so heartbreaking to hear those women
talk about what they were going through...</i>

461
00:34:56,961 --> 00:34:58,394
<i>and what they are going through.</i>

462
00:34:58,463 --> 00:35:02,194
<i>The second woman, Joan,
her case is realy not very unusual.</i>

463
00:35:03,301 --> 00:35:06,464
<i>Her husband was the financial planner.
She realy did not have...</i>

464
00:35:06,537 --> 00:35:09,199
<i>much involvement
in the finances at the home.</i>

465
00:35:09,574 --> 00:35:11,337
<i>What are your thoughts on that?</i>

466
00:35:11,409 --> 00:35:14,344
<i>Women tend to have the feeling
that they're not confident.</i>

467
00:35:14,412 --> 00:35:17,677
<i>Men tend to be overconfident,
actualy, in the financial area.</i>

468
00:35:17,748 --> 00:35:21,741
<i>And women have to take responsibility,
and have to accept the fact...</i>

469
00:35:21,819 --> 00:35:23,013
<i>that something like this...</i>

470
00:35:23,087 --> 00:35:24,918
<i>We don't need no</i>

471
00:35:26,757 --> 00:35:29,555
<i>We don't need no thought control</i>

472
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:34,064
<i>You have to have a contingency plan
if your husband doesn't come home...</i>

473
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,656
<i>to take care of the finances.</i>

474
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:17,205
You gotta get up, Ma.
You can't lie there day and night.

475
00:36:18,576 --> 00:36:19,804
I wanna go home.

476
00:36:21,979 --> 00:36:25,346
There is no more home, Ma. We sold it.
You know that.

477
00:36:25,983 --> 00:36:28,042
They keep making me eat all alone.

478
00:36:28,553 --> 00:36:32,182
That's that Cookie and Minn.
I tried to be so nice.

479
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:36,348
I bought Cookie a card
from the gift shop downstairs.

480
00:36:36,594 --> 00:36:40,394
I cared enough, and I sent the very best.

481
00:36:40,765 --> 00:36:42,062
Don't you worry, Ma.

482
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:46,268
I'm gonna talk to this social director.
She's the one to straighten this all out.

483
00:36:46,904 --> 00:36:49,634
But in the meantime,
maybe you can make new friends.

484
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:52,608
But you gotta get up out of bed.
At least sit up.

485
00:38:17,728 --> 00:38:18,353
No.

486
00:39:21,325 --> 00:39:23,316
<i>Friggitoria Fiorenzano...</i>

487
00:39:24,462 --> 00:39:28,330
<i>in my opinion, this is probably one of
the closest things we'I find in Naples...</i>

488
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:32,699
<i>to what you realy should open.
It's an al- day snack shop, pizzeria...</i>

489
00:39:32,937 --> 00:39:35,030
<i>friggitoria and rosticceria.</i>

490
00:39:35,306 --> 00:39:37,638
<i>Roast shop, fry shop, pizza shop.</i>

491
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:40,040
<i>Here are four examples...</i>

492
00:39:40,478 --> 00:39:43,811
<i>of the classic Neapolitan pride.</i>

493
00:39:55,993 --> 00:39:58,826
<i>It's in a light batter, fried til very crisp.</i>

494
00:39:59,029 --> 00:40:01,554
<i>We've got those zucchini flowers,
you recognize those?</i>

495
00:40:02,032 --> 00:40:04,592
We're bringing her back
to the track in two weeks.

496
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:07,132
Lois says she's ready to race.

497
00:40:07,972 --> 00:40:09,837
- Thanks.
- Thanks, hon.

498
00:40:11,375 --> 00:40:13,434
I like my drink with extra olives.

499
00:40:13,844 --> 00:40:16,870
You should know how
your regular customers like their drinks.

500
00:40:17,381 --> 00:40:19,713
My regular customers are the ones who pay.

501
00:40:20,618 --> 00:40:22,415
I'll get you your olives.

502
00:40:26,123 --> 00:40:28,057
What do you have to give her shit for?

503
00:40:28,125 --> 00:40:29,854
She likes it, it's banter.

504
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:32,020
I don't think she likes it, or you.

505
00:40:32,229 --> 00:40:36,427
I don't give a flying fuck, my brother,
what any little slit thinks of me.

506
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:42,873
Does that include... What's her name?

507
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:45,472
- Who?
- You brought her to the stables.

508
00:40:46,911 --> 00:40:49,505
Valentina. Her especially.

509
00:40:49,814 --> 00:40:51,406
And her, I'm crazy about.

510
00:40:51,649 --> 00:40:53,810
I'm telling you, this broad knows things.

511
00:40:53,884 --> 00:40:57,251
I've never been fucked so long or so good.

512
00:40:58,823 --> 00:41:00,347
I may have to marry her.

513
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:06,763
These enough?

514
00:41:06,931 --> 00:41:09,126
You know, no reason to be snotty.

515
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:12,233
My dear departed mother used to say:

516
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:14,896
"You catch more flies with honey...

517
00:41:15,172 --> 00:41:17,367
"than you can with vinegar. "

518
00:41:20,344 --> 00:41:24,280
Well, mine always told me not to let myself
be talked down to by losers.

519
00:41:24,615 --> 00:41:28,073
She said you can tell everything
about a man by the way he treats women.

520
00:41:37,061 --> 00:41:39,552
- You ever think about your mother?
- She's dead.

521
00:41:40,231 --> 00:41:42,631
You two didn't get along very well, right?

522
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,224
She had her demanding ways.

523
00:41:46,403 --> 00:41:49,338
- When you were a kid, did she ever...
- No, I gotta go.

524
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:52,441
The Mambo Queen awaits.

525
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:59,945
I'm sorry your mom's having
a difficult adjustment period.

526
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:01,507
- Sit.
- It's not her.

527
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:03,983
It's the rest of them. They single her out.

528
00:42:04,722 --> 00:42:08,123
Sometimes I think this place
is like high school with wheelchairs.

529
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:12,329
Tell your mother to be patient.
Things will settle down.

530
00:42:12,963 --> 00:42:15,227
All right, I'll talk to her again.

531
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:17,692
But what the hell are you gonna do for us?

532
00:42:17,768 --> 00:42:21,169
- What we pay here.
- I'm speaking from years of experience.

533
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:23,131
Your mom's going to have to learn...

534
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:25,539
to accept responsibility
for her own behavior.

535
00:42:25,609 --> 00:42:26,769
Like what?

536
00:42:27,745 --> 00:42:28,734
Go ahead.

537
00:42:30,114 --> 00:42:32,139
For one thing, she cries a lot.

538
00:42:33,684 --> 00:42:35,015
She's always in tears.

539
00:42:35,586 --> 00:42:39,784
At Mass, in the exercise room,
at music appreciation.

540
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:42,085
- She's got a big heart.
- Let me finish.

541
00:42:43,694 --> 00:42:45,662
She doesn't always put her teeth in.

542
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:48,154
The girls don't like that.

543
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:51,226
- This is not good.
- Right.

544
00:42:51,769 --> 00:42:53,361
Also, she's a tattletale.

545
00:42:53,437 --> 00:42:56,235
She tells on the other girls
for the slightest infraction.

546
00:42:56,307 --> 00:42:59,208
She's just not very adept at making friends.

547
00:42:59,977 --> 00:43:02,172
She's gonna have to make more of an effort.

548
00:43:02,313 --> 00:43:04,474
You might want to talk to her about this.

549
00:43:27,571 --> 00:43:30,301
Hey, Conny Contino ever get
those washing machines?

550
00:43:30,374 --> 00:43:32,467
I don't understand.
You want to know this shit?

551
00:43:32,543 --> 00:43:35,103
'Cause you go back on everything
Sil and me get settled.

552
00:43:35,179 --> 00:43:37,044
I don't got a right to be concerned?

553
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:38,206
<i>Hold on.</i>

554
00:43:43,087 --> 00:43:44,850
- Go.
- Long time no see.

555
00:43:47,024 --> 00:43:48,753
- Is this you?
- I am me.

556
00:43:48,826 --> 00:43:51,351
<i>- I've been busy, you know.
- Then I forgive you.</i>

557
00:43:51,428 --> 00:43:53,760
When can I see you?
I've got something to tell you.

558
00:43:53,831 --> 00:43:56,231
Look, I told you the situation.

559
00:43:56,433 --> 00:43:59,630
Come on, Tony.
Just for a coffee or a drink or something.

560
00:44:02,206 --> 00:44:05,903
All right, you know the Coach House
on Route 21 in Passaic?

561
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:07,600
No, but I can find it.

562
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:10,644
- Can you be there by noon?
- Nothing could keep me away.

563
00:44:11,281 --> 00:44:13,010
All right, I'll see you there.

564
00:44:18,288 --> 00:44:20,779
All right, I want to see
you and Sil this afternoon.

565
00:44:21,392 --> 00:44:23,690
2:00 at the other place.

566
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:34,326
Fuck.

567
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:55,788
So sorry I'm late.
I had to make up this whole thing at work.

568
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:57,622
- It's all right.
- What can I get for you?

569
00:44:57,695 --> 00:44:59,287
Evian, whatever.

570
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:05,525
So, I'm here.
What's this big thing you have to tell me?

571
00:45:07,938 --> 00:45:09,462
I broke up with Ralph.

572
00:45:11,108 --> 00:45:12,405
- When?
- Last night.

573
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:14,434
I just couldn't take it.

574
00:45:14,511 --> 00:45:17,446
- He brought out this leather mask with this...
- All right.

575
00:45:22,352 --> 00:45:24,582
This means we can be together.

576
00:45:28,525 --> 00:45:30,516
Look, Valentina, I'm...

577
00:45:31,361 --> 00:45:34,296
I'm a married man.
I'm a happily married man with two kids.

578
00:45:34,364 --> 00:45:36,298
I just wanna see you sometimes.

579
00:45:36,366 --> 00:45:38,994
A couple nights a week.
I'm not gonna say I love you.

580
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:42,732
I always say that too soon to guys,
and I'm trying to work on that, but...

581
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:45,238
I really like you.

582
00:45:45,309 --> 00:45:48,039
I like you, too, honey,
but it's not gonna happen.

583
00:45:48,812 --> 00:45:50,336
Why? Why not?

584
00:45:51,448 --> 00:45:53,939
For one thing, I already took his horse.

585
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:13,964
$9,900.

586
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:16,872
Interestingly, at $10,000...

587
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:20,068
we're required by law
to notify the IRS of the transaction.

588
00:46:20,144 --> 00:46:22,977
Really? I want it in something safe.

589
00:46:23,347 --> 00:46:25,713
Something old economy, maybe treasuries.

590
00:47:14,231 --> 00:47:15,562
Don't you knock?

591
00:47:18,268 --> 00:47:21,931
Listen, Jan, can we shut this off a minute?
I got something I gotta ask you.

592
00:47:22,239 --> 00:47:23,297
Sure.

593
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:31,514
It's a little awkward.

594
00:47:33,617 --> 00:47:34,709
It's about Ralph.

595
00:47:35,619 --> 00:47:37,610
- That scumbag?
- Yeah, well...

596
00:47:38,555 --> 00:47:40,887
I'm trying to find out about his sex life.

597
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:45,192
- And who would know better?
- He would.

598
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:47,493
- Ask him.
- I can't.

599
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:50,193
I can only ask you.

600
00:47:52,002 --> 00:47:53,902
I mean, is he weird about sex?

601
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:59,305
- Why you interested in this?
- I got my reasons. Managerial.

602
00:48:00,244 --> 00:48:04,112
You know, like the army, it's got policies
about this shit, on account of combat.

603
00:48:04,181 --> 00:48:07,548
I have to tell you, I'm finding
this entire conversation insulting.

604
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:09,579
Here we go.

605
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:12,950
You're asking me to betray confidences.

606
00:48:15,826 --> 00:48:19,455
I mean, no matter what
either one of us think of the guy...

607
00:48:31,275 --> 00:48:32,640
$3,000.

608
00:48:34,511 --> 00:48:36,035
How'd you come up with that figure?

609
00:48:36,113 --> 00:48:39,105
It's a number
that I thought you'd say yes to.

610
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:40,845
You thought right.

611
00:48:41,652 --> 00:48:43,210
So, what have you heard?

612
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:46,348
You pay me $3,000,
I'll answer your questions.

613
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:48,118
He bottoms from the top.

614
00:48:49,393 --> 00:48:51,156
I don't even know what that means.

615
00:48:51,228 --> 00:48:55,062
It means he has to control things,
but he pretends he doesn't.

616
00:48:55,499 --> 00:48:58,229
Like, he'd make me fuck him
with a strap-on...

617
00:48:58,368 --> 00:49:00,563
and call him my bitch, shit like that.

618
00:49:00,637 --> 00:49:04,266
- What about plain old fucking?
- I'm telling you. He can't get hard that way.

619
00:49:04,374 --> 00:49:07,241
And if he could,
I don't think that he'd want to.

620
00:49:21,191 --> 00:49:23,751
I couldn't believe it when you called.

621
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:26,554
I was so happy.

622
00:49:28,732 --> 00:49:30,666
I'm feeling pretty happy myself.

623
00:49:33,103 --> 00:49:35,298
Why the big change of heart?

624
00:49:38,742 --> 00:49:41,540
Well, I was never hesitating 'cause of you.

625
00:49:42,245 --> 00:49:44,770
I just had to get my head into a place...

626
00:49:45,282 --> 00:49:48,877
where I felt
that I could really commit, you know.

627
00:49:50,354 --> 00:49:52,982
To lavish all the care on you
that you should have.

628
00:50:27,924 --> 00:50:31,360
I don't see why
I have to do anything I don't want to.

629
00:50:32,129 --> 00:50:34,097
This is Green Grove.

630
00:50:34,464 --> 00:50:37,262
Here the senior citizen is king and queen.

631
00:50:37,801 --> 00:50:41,328
I know, but they told Charles
that this was just a warning.

632
00:50:41,405 --> 00:50:43,339
These people don't fool around.

633
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:45,807
You're afraid of them.

634
00:50:45,942 --> 00:50:48,342
Of course he is, and so am I.

635
00:50:48,612 --> 00:50:51,479
This is a stupid thing
for your son to get hurt over.

636
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:55,882
I didn't live for 84 years
to have to be nice to somebody I don't like!

637
00:50:57,387 --> 00:50:59,514
Haven't I earned that right?

638
00:51:00,624 --> 00:51:04,685
Ma, I'm gonna have to say this.
If you can't get into the spirit of this thing...

639
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:08,023
then we'll have
to let you live in a different home.

640
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:13,827
The Salvation Army has one in Irvington
that's supposed to be perfectly fine.

641
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:03,150
Coffee, Ton'?

642
00:52:05,655 --> 00:52:07,384
Got any decaf?

643
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:13,418
- No, forget it, regular's fine.
- Well, I can make decaf.

644
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:16,258
Yeah, that'd be great, thanks.

645
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:38,113
Something wrong, Tony?

646
00:52:41,491 --> 00:52:42,480
No.

647
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:44,749
Why?

648
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:54,326
You out in the backyard
the last couple a days?

649
00:52:54,404 --> 00:52:56,838
Me? It's freezing out there.

650
00:52:58,942 --> 00:53:00,375
You sure?

651
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:02,334
The pool guy come around?

652
00:53:02,412 --> 00:53:05,176
- Why would he?
- Check up on stuff? Something?

653
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:08,545
All right, I'm going upstairs.

654
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:16,853
It'll only take a minute.

655
00:53:28,638 --> 00:53:32,005
You sure, Tony, there's not something
you wanna talk about?

656
00:53:34,177 --> 00:53:35,337
No.

657
00:53:36,846 --> 00:53:37,904
Like what?

658
00:53:38,305 --> 00:54:38,172
