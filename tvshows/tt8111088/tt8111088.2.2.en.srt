1
00:00:10,636 --> 00:00:13,176
I am told that
you can lead me to others of my kind.

2
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:15,773
Come on. It's uncouth
to talk business immediately.

3
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:22,727
All right, stop!
I'll tell you where he is.

4
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:25,534
The city of Mos Pelgo.
I swear it by the Gotra.

5
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:31,569
Oh! This little thing
has had me worried sick.

6
00:00:31,657 --> 00:00:34,117
I need your help. Where is Mos Pelgo?

7
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:36,951
It's an old mining settlement.
Not much to speak of.

8
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:39,211
Where did you get the armor?

9
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:40,289
Bought it off some Jawas.

10
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:41,996
Hand it over.

11
00:00:42,084 --> 00:00:44,174
I'm sure you call the shots
where you come from,

12
00:00:44,253 --> 00:00:48,303
but 'round here,
I'm the one tells folks what to do.

13
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:51,888
Help me kill it, I'll give you the armor.

14
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:55,259
- That's the krayt dragon.
- It's bigger'n I guessed.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

16
00:01:08,694 --> 00:01:11,204
This was well-earned.
Thank you.

17
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:45,542
Get the Child!

18
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:23,164
Wait! Don't hurt the Child.

19
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:26,038
If you put one mark on him,

20
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:28,383
there's no place you will be able
to hide from me.

21
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:33,381
We can strike a bargain.
There's a lot of value in this wreckage.

22
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:35,796
Take your pick.

23
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:40,759
But leave the Child.

24
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:50,269
Okay.

25
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:57,111
Here. It's yours.

26
00:03:59,198 --> 00:04:00,198
Take it.

27
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:05,788
It's okay.

28
00:04:20,636 --> 00:04:22,346
You okay?

29
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:09,827
I don't know. Looks like someone's
gonna be goin' home empty-handed.

30
00:06:16,335 --> 00:06:19,375
You finally found a Mandalorian
and ya killed him?

31
00:06:19,463 --> 00:06:23,303
He wasn't Mandalorian.
I bought this armor off of him, though.

32
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:26,683
- What'd that set you back?
- Killed the krayt dragon for him.

33
00:06:26,762 --> 00:06:28,892
Oh. Is that all?

34
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:31,432
He was my last lead
on finding other Mandalorians.

35
00:06:33,936 --> 00:06:36,306
Okay. Well, you might be in luck.

36
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:39,226
Dr. Mandible says he can connect you
with someone who can help you,

37
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:42,566
if you cover his call this round.
It's what he said.

38
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:45,356
What's the bet?

39
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:50,155
- Five hundred.
- That's a high-stakes game.

40
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:52,252
Hey, he's on a hot streak.

41
00:06:58,293 --> 00:07:00,383
Is the pot right?

42
00:07:00,963 --> 00:07:03,883
Ha! Idiot's Array! Pay up, thorax!

43
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,545
I thought you said
he was on a hot streak?

44
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:09,466
Oh. stop your cryin'. You'll rust.

45
00:07:12,683 --> 00:07:16,063
All right. He says the contact
will rendezvous at the hangar.

46
00:07:18,564 --> 00:07:21,534
They'll tell you where to find
some Mandalorians.

47
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:23,148
That's what you wanted, right?

48
00:07:23,694 --> 00:07:26,494
- Yes.
- All right, well, stop your mopin'.

49
00:07:26,572 --> 00:07:29,282
More importantly, did you bring back
any of that dragon meat?

50
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:32,116
Better not have any maggots on it.
I don't like maggots.

51
00:07:44,173 --> 00:07:47,933
Hey, don't overcook it, Treadwell.
I like it medium rare!

52
00:07:48,427 --> 00:07:50,637
I'm not some Rodian, for crying out loud.

53
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:54,390
All right, here's the deal.

54
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:58,814
A Mandalorian covert is close.
It's in this sector, one system trailing.

55
00:07:58,896 --> 00:08:00,396
Are they the ones that left Nevarro?

56
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,400
Don't know. All I know is that the contact
will lead you to them.

57
00:08:03,859 --> 00:08:07,649
- How much will it cost me?
- Well, that's the great news. It's free.

58
00:08:07,738 --> 00:08:09,698
Aside from a finder's fee, of course.

59
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:12,911
- What's the not-great news?
- Nothing. It's all great.

60
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:14,453
Okay.

61
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:18,246
However, there is one small skank
in the scud pie.

62
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:22,422
- Which is?
- The contact wants passage to the system.

63
00:08:23,212 --> 00:08:25,052
- Do you vouch for them?
- On my life.

64
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:28,927
- Fine.
- And...

65
00:08:30,511 --> 00:08:31,851
no hyperdrive.

66
00:08:31,929 --> 00:08:34,519
You want me to travel sublight?
Deal's off.

67
00:08:34,598 --> 00:08:35,848
It's one sector over.

68
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:38,483
Moving fast is the only thing
keeping me safe.

69
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,560
These are mitigating circumstances.

70
00:08:40,646 --> 00:08:43,316
What do you mean "mitigating"?

71
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:52,531
- I'm not a taxi service.
- I know, I know, I hear you.

72
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:54,026
But I can vouch for her.

73
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:03,667
What's the cargo?

74
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:09,514
It's her spawn. She needs her eggs
fertilized by the equinox

75
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:13,681
or her line will end.
If you jump into hyperspace, they'll die.

76
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:17,062
She said her husband has settled
on the estuary moon of Trask

77
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,690
in the system of the gas giant Kol Iben.

78
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:22,978
- She said all that?
- I paraphrased.

79
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:29,491
Is she sure
there are Mandalorians there?

80
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:36,948
She said her husband has seen them.

81
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:48,921
Do you know the husband?

82
00:09:49,006 --> 00:09:51,256
No. I met her ten minutes
before you walked in.

83
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:53,721
I thought you said
you vouched for her on your life.

84
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:57,563
What can I say,
I'm an excellent judge of character.

85
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:10,065
Now, I'm gonna ask you to stay strapped in
whenever you're seated.

86
00:10:10,152 --> 00:10:12,862
Traveling sublight
is a bit dicey these days.

87
00:10:14,323 --> 00:10:17,203
Whether it's pirates or warlords,

88
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:21,004
someone either ends up
with a nice chunk of change or your ship.

89
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:28,836
I don't speak whatever language that is.
You speak Huttese?

90
00:11:23,267 --> 00:11:26,437
So, I'm gonna hit the rack.
I've set the nav for our course.

91
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:30,270
It's gonna take a while.
I recommend you get some rest.

92
00:11:40,409 --> 00:11:41,409
Kid?

93
00:11:46,123 --> 00:11:47,923
No, no, no!

94
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:52,882
That is not food. Don't do that again.

95
00:11:53,672 --> 00:11:54,722
Nap time.

96
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:25,289
Razor Crest, M-One-Eleven.
Come in, Razor Crest. Do you copy?

97
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:36,844
This is Razor Crest.
Is there a problem?

98
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:40,136
We noticed your transponder
is not emitting.

99
00:12:40,886 --> 00:12:43,386
Yes, I'm pre-Empire surplus.

100
00:12:43,472 --> 00:12:45,772
I'm not required to run a beacon.

101
00:12:45,849 --> 00:12:49,689
That was before. This sector
is under New Republic jurisdiction.

102
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:51,730
All craft are required to run a beacon.

103
00:12:53,148 --> 00:12:55,898
Thank you for letting me know.
I'll get right on it.

104
00:12:57,361 --> 00:12:59,451
Not a problem. Safe travels.

105
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:01,320
May the Force be with you.

106
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:02,566
And also with you.

107
00:13:06,954 --> 00:13:09,414
- Just one more thing.
- Yes?

108
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:13,917
I'm gonna
need you to send us a ping.

109
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:16,552
We're out here sweeping
for Imperial holdouts.

110
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,420
I'll let you know if I see any.

111
00:13:19,383 --> 00:13:21,843
I'm still gonna need you
to send us that ping.

112
00:13:24,388 --> 00:13:26,968
Well, I'm not sure
I have that hardware online.

113
00:13:29,226 --> 00:13:30,226
We can wait.

114
00:13:34,106 --> 00:13:37,356
Yeah, I...
Doesn't seem to be working.

115
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:41,530
That's too bad. If we can't
confirm you're not Imperial,

116
00:13:41,613 --> 00:13:44,163
you're gonna have to follow us
to the outpost at Adelphi.

117
00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:45,371
They'll run your tabs.

118
00:13:46,827 --> 00:13:51,367
Oh, wait. There it is. Transmitting now.

119
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:53,246
- Be quiet!
- What's that?

120
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:57,633
Uh, nothing. The hypervac
is drawing off the exhaust manifold.

121
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:05,386
Carson, can you switch over
to channel two?

122
00:14:06,597 --> 00:14:07,597
Copy.

123
00:14:22,237 --> 00:14:23,817
Was your craft in the proximity

124
00:14:23,906 --> 00:14:26,486
of New Republic Correctional Transport,
Bothan-Five?

125
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,880
- We got a runner.
- I'm on it.

126
00:14:52,017 --> 00:14:56,357
Razor Crest, stand down.
We will fire. I repeat, we will fire.

127
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:08,575
I don't know where he thinks
he's goin' in that thing.

128
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:12,697
That thing's gonna
break apart in this atmosphere.

129
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,242
He's headin' down
into that canyon.

130
00:15:44,319 --> 00:15:47,239
I got 'im. Target computer active.

131
00:15:56,582 --> 00:15:58,832
Come on, Razor Crest,
don't make us do it.

132
00:16:14,975 --> 00:16:16,305
Hold on.

133
00:16:33,952 --> 00:16:36,662
I've lost visual.
He's got to be around here somewhere.

134
00:16:36,747 --> 00:16:38,827
You head north. We'll cover more ground.

135
00:17:35,764 --> 00:17:37,354
I'll find your eggs, don't worry.

136
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:41,599
Gotta get you some blankets,
keep you warm.

137
00:17:55,701 --> 00:17:56,701
Damn it.

138
00:17:59,955 --> 00:18:01,035
Where are you?

139
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:04,915
Hang on, I'm looking for your eggs!

140
00:18:20,184 --> 00:18:23,774
No! I told you not to do that.

141
00:18:27,649 --> 00:18:28,819
Found them!

142
00:18:33,947 --> 00:18:35,197
How many did you eat?

143
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:43,868
If you hadn't guessed,
we're in a tight spot.

144
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:48,708
The main power drive is not responding,
and the hull has lost its integrity.

145
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:52,585
I suspect the temperature
will drop significantly when night falls.

146
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:57,471
I'll have a better idea
of our prospects at that time.

147
00:19:08,941 --> 00:19:11,031
I'm sorry, lady. I don't understand Frog.

148
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:16,200
Whatever it is, it can wait until morning.
I recommend you get some sleep.

149
00:19:56,488 --> 00:19:58,028
Wake up, Mandalorian.

150
00:20:00,117 --> 00:20:02,037
This cannot wait until morning.

151
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:07,670
Do not be alarmed. I bypassed
the droid's security protocols

152
00:20:07,749 --> 00:20:09,999
and accessed its vocabulator.

153
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:14,720
What the hell are you doing?

154
00:20:16,258 --> 00:20:17,838
That droid is a killer.

155
00:20:18,594 --> 00:20:21,684
These eggs are the last brood
of my life cycle.

156
00:20:21,763 --> 00:20:25,813
My husband has risked his life
to carve out an existence for us

157
00:20:25,893 --> 00:20:29,233
on the only planet
that is hospitable to our species.

158
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:32,980
We fought too hard and suffered too much

159
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:36,356
to resign ourselves to the extinction
of our family line.

160
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:41,280
I must demand that you hold true
to the deal that you agreed to.

161
00:20:45,495 --> 00:20:48,075
Look, lady, the deal is off.

162
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:52,458
We're lucky if we get off this frozen tomb
with our lives.

163
00:20:53,921 --> 00:20:57,971
I thought honoring one's word
was a part of the Mandalorian code.

164
00:21:00,844 --> 00:21:03,514
I guess those are just stories
for children.

165
00:21:25,285 --> 00:21:27,035
This was not a part of the deal.

166
00:22:34,062 --> 00:22:38,072
How 'bout you come over here,
give me a hand? Make yourself useful.

167
00:22:45,532 --> 00:22:46,742
Hey, kid.

168
00:22:49,703 --> 00:22:54,293
I said hey! Where are you going?
Come back here!

169
00:23:06,929 --> 00:23:08,059
When did she go?

170
00:24:28,218 --> 00:24:29,218
There you are.

171
00:24:35,851 --> 00:24:38,941
You can't leave the ship.
It's not safe out here.

172
00:24:46,445 --> 00:24:47,645
Let's gather these up.

173
00:24:49,948 --> 00:24:55,198
I know it's warm. But night's coming fast,
and I can't protect you out here.

174
00:25:09,009 --> 00:25:10,929
No. No!

175
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:40,660
Go, go, go! Back to the ship!

176
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,330
Strap yourselves in. This better work.

177
00:31:21,131 --> 00:31:24,381
I've got limited visibility.
It's gonna be a bumpy ride.

178
00:33:16,246 --> 00:33:18,116
We ran the tabs on the Razor Crest.

179
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:21,880
You have an arrest warrant

180
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:25,050
for the abduction
of prisoner X-Six-Nine-Eleven.

181
00:33:26,381 --> 00:33:31,601
However, on board security records
show that you apprehended

182
00:33:31,678 --> 00:33:34,388
three priority culprits
from the Wanted Register.

183
00:33:35,307 --> 00:33:38,887
Security records also show
that you put your own life in harm's way

184
00:33:38,977 --> 00:33:43,147
to try to protect that of Lieutenant Davan
from the New Republic Correctional Corps.

185
00:33:44,483 --> 00:33:45,863
Is this true?

186
00:33:45,943 --> 00:33:47,573
Am I under arrest?

187
00:33:47,653 --> 00:33:49,493
Technically, you should be.

188
00:33:51,865 --> 00:33:53,575
But these are trying times.

189
00:33:55,619 --> 00:33:59,039
What say I forego
the bounties on these three criminals,

190
00:33:59,122 --> 00:34:02,172
and you two help me fuse my hull
so I can get off this frozen rock?

191
00:34:04,795 --> 00:34:06,505
What say you fix that transponder,

192
00:34:06,588 --> 00:34:09,718
and we don't vaporize that antique
the next time we patrol the Rim?

193
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:53,260
All right. I'm gonna repair the cockpit
enough for us to limp to Trask.

194
00:34:54,011 --> 00:34:56,511
There's nothing I can do
about the main hull's integrity,

195
00:34:56,597 --> 00:34:58,967
so we're gonna have to get cozy
in the cockpit.

196
00:34:59,641 --> 00:35:01,521
It's the only thing I can pressurize.

197
00:35:02,811 --> 00:35:07,071
If you need to use the privy, do it now.
It's gonna be a long ride.

198
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:33,220
Okay, repair's all done.

199
00:35:34,343 --> 00:35:37,433
Let's see if we can get this thing going
once and for all.

200
00:36:07,042 --> 00:36:11,882
Wake me up if someone shoots at us.
Or that door gets sucked off its rails.

201
00:36:15,342 --> 00:36:20,352
I'm kidding. If that happened,
we'd all be dead. Sweet dreams.

201
00:36:21,305 --> 00:37:21,931
