1
00:00:01,318 --> 00:00:03,113
You are being watched...

2
00:00:04,024 --> 00:00:06,084
The government has
a secret system,

3
00:00:06,273 --> 00:00:07,425
a machine

4
00:00:07,684 --> 00:00:10,168
that spies on you
every hour of every day.

5
00:00:10,862 --> 00:00:12,107
I know because...

6
00:00:12,213 --> 00:00:13,254
I built it.

7
00:00:13,591 --> 00:00:15,776
I designed the machine to
detect acts of terror,

8
00:00:15,856 --> 00:00:17,136
but it sees everything...

9
00:00:17,138 --> 00:00:19,922
Violent crimes
involving ordinary people,

10
00:00:19,924 --> 00:00:21,357
people like you,

11
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,027
crimes the government
considered irrelevant.

12
00:00:25,029 --> 00:00:28,381
They wouldn't act,
so I decided I would.

13
00:00:28,383 --> 00:00:30,249
But I needed a partner--

14
00:00:30,251 --> 00:00:32,952
Someone with the skills
to intervene.

15
00:00:32,954 --> 00:00:37,156
Hunted by the authorities,
we work in secret.

16
00:00:37,158 --> 00:00:39,108
You will never find us.

17
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:41,110
But victim or perpetrator,

18
00:00:41,112 --> 00:00:44,046
if your number's up,
we'll find you.

21
00:01:03,137 --> 00:01:04,466
He's all yours.

22
00:01:05,903 --> 00:01:09,021
I already told
the other Americans...

23
00:01:09,023 --> 00:01:11,741
I deliver
fruits and vegetables.

24
00:01:11,743 --> 00:01:13,192
You deliver explosives
for Al-Qaeda.

25
00:01:13,194 --> 00:01:15,945
Your cell is responsible
for a suicide bomb

26
00:01:15,947 --> 00:01:18,647
that killed three U.S. soldiers
in Fallujah.

27
00:01:18,649 --> 00:01:20,216
You should tell me the location

28
00:01:20,218 --> 00:01:23,035
of the remainder
of those explosives.

29
00:01:23,037 --> 00:01:24,837
Talk to me,

30
00:01:24,839 --> 00:01:28,541
or else you're gonna have
to talk to my boss.

31
00:01:28,543 --> 00:01:29,992
And believe me when I tell you,

32
00:01:29,994 --> 00:01:33,129
you don't want to talk
to my boss.

33
00:01:34,932 --> 00:01:36,265
All right.

34
00:01:45,108 --> 00:01:47,476
Hello, Yusuf.

35
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,501
Getting too close--
Enough already.

36
00:01:55,503 --> 00:01:56,786
She goes...Today.

37
00:01:56,788 --> 00:01:59,372
But it's got to be clean.

38
00:02:00,424 --> 00:02:01,757
You can't keep coming
in here like this.

39
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:03,325
I gotta go.
Detective Carter?

40
00:02:03,327 --> 00:02:05,294
It's Mrs. Kovach here
to bail out her husband.

41
00:02:05,296 --> 00:02:06,262
Again?

42
00:02:06,264 --> 00:02:08,014
Figured maybe
you could talk to her.

43
00:02:08,016 --> 00:02:09,682
Thanks.

44
00:02:12,636 --> 00:02:16,839
I work homicide,
Mrs. Kovach, okay?

45
00:02:16,841 --> 00:02:18,808
I'm the one who ha
to investigate it

46
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:22,228
when your husband finally
beats you to death.

47
00:02:28,652 --> 00:02:31,520
Look, every time you tell us
it was an accident,

48
00:02:31,522 --> 00:02:34,356
you're strengthening
the story he's gonna use

49
00:02:34,358 --> 00:02:37,359
to get out of it--
That you were clumsy,

50
00:02:37,361 --> 00:02:39,528
accident-prone.

51
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:42,999
Do you hear me?

52
00:02:43,001 --> 00:02:46,419
The stairs.

53
00:02:46,421 --> 00:02:48,504
I fell down the stairs.

54
00:02:53,844 --> 00:02:56,211
If he puts his hands
on you again,

55
00:02:56,213 --> 00:02:57,546
call me.

56
00:03:00,684 --> 00:03:04,403
Sorry.
I have to go.

57
00:03:08,325 --> 00:03:10,242
I don't know
why you bother, Carter.

58
00:03:10,244 --> 00:03:11,393
You can't save 'em all.

59
00:03:11,395 --> 00:03:13,579
That's a homicide
waiting to happen.

60
00:03:13,581 --> 00:03:16,248
Figured I'd try to stop one
for a change.

61
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,367
DNA came back on the shooter
you winged a couple weeks ago.

62
00:03:18,369 --> 00:03:20,036
The guy who took a shot at you.

63
00:03:20,038 --> 00:03:23,539
Half the DNA
matched Marlene Elias...

64
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:26,292
The other half...
Don Moretti.

65
00:03:27,761 --> 00:03:31,964
Carl Elias-- The bastard son
you left to rot in the system

66
00:03:31,966 --> 00:03:35,051
after you murdered his mother
almost 40 years ago.

67
00:03:35,053 --> 00:03:36,251
Your mistress.

68
00:03:36,253 --> 00:03:37,920
I told you before, sweetheart.

69
00:03:37,922 --> 00:03:41,440
I ain't the father
of nobody by that name.

70
00:03:41,442 --> 00:03:43,275
DNA says otherwise, Don.

71
00:03:43,277 --> 00:03:45,444
You're a perfect match.

72
00:03:45,446 --> 00:03:46,779
And guess what.

73
00:03:46,781 --> 00:03:49,148
Your son's all grown up now.

74
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:53,953
Just a few
of his recent victims.

75
00:03:53,955 --> 00:03:56,872
Retired Detective
Bernie Sullivan,

76
00:03:56,874 --> 00:03:59,959
your old capo Vincent Deluca.

77
00:04:03,246 --> 00:04:05,447
What is this?
What do I care?

78
00:04:05,449 --> 00:04:07,500
I'm gonna die
an old man in here.

79
00:04:07,502 --> 00:04:09,301
Maybe sooner than you think.

80
00:04:09,303 --> 00:04:11,671
You killed his mother,
and you left him to the wolves.

81
00:04:11,673 --> 00:04:15,307
What do you think
he's gonna do to you?

82
00:04:15,309 --> 00:04:19,395
I wouldn't expect
any father's day cards.

83
00:04:19,397 --> 00:04:21,480
If you help me,

84
00:04:21,482 --> 00:04:24,400
I can offer you
protective custody.

85
00:04:24,402 --> 00:04:27,302
Who do you think
you're talking to?

86
00:04:27,304 --> 00:04:30,773
You don't get it.
Elias can get to you anywhere.

87
00:04:30,775 --> 00:04:34,694
He can find someone you know,
turn them on you.

88
00:04:34,696 --> 00:04:35,811
And you know what?

89
00:04:35,813 --> 00:04:37,646
It's not a question of if,
but when.

90
00:04:37,648 --> 00:04:41,150
Telling me this guy
already took out a cop,

91
00:04:41,152 --> 00:04:44,086
took a shot at you
'cause you got too close,

92
00:04:44,088 --> 00:04:48,674
and you came here
to warn me, huh?

93
00:04:48,676 --> 00:04:51,160
Consider it a courtesy call.

94
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:56,215
There a task force
going after this Elias,

95
00:04:56,217 --> 00:04:58,684
or is it just you, detective?

96
00:04:58,686 --> 00:05:00,186
What is that supposed to mean?

97
00:05:00,188 --> 00:05:04,440
Way it looks from my side
of the fence, you're all alone.

98
00:05:04,442 --> 00:05:08,144
Sounds to me like maybe
he's coming after you.

99
00:05:14,785 --> 00:05:16,952
All units respond--

100
00:05:16,954 --> 00:05:19,071
Shooting at 168th and Audubon.

101
00:05:19,073 --> 00:05:21,407
I came as soon as I heard
the description.

102
00:05:21,409 --> 00:05:23,492
Yeah, got a young
African-American male

103
00:05:23,494 --> 00:05:24,710
gunned down on his way home.

104
00:05:24,712 --> 00:05:25,995
I got 9-millimeter casings
all over the curb.

105
00:05:25,997 --> 00:05:27,863
Looks like
it was a drive-by.

106
00:05:27,865 --> 00:05:29,665
Any witnesses see the car?

107
00:05:29,667 --> 00:05:32,334
In this neighborhood?
You're kidding, right?

108
00:05:34,222 --> 00:05:37,556
- Ronnie Middleton.
- You knew this kid?

109
00:05:37,558 --> 00:05:40,426
He witnessed a shooting
six months ago up in the Bronx.

110
00:05:40,428 --> 00:05:43,729
ID'd the shooter-- Neighborhood
thug Hector Alvarez.

111
00:05:43,731 --> 00:05:45,381
- This kid was a snitch?
- Yeah.

112
00:05:45,383 --> 00:05:48,684
He got cold feet though.
Recanted his testimony.

113
00:05:48,686 --> 00:05:50,269
D.A. Dropped the case.

114
00:05:50,271 --> 00:05:51,821
Looks like Hector found him.

115
00:05:51,823 --> 00:05:53,606
He won't get away
with it again.

116
00:05:53,608 --> 00:05:55,241
Was Ronnie carrying?

117
00:05:55,243 --> 00:05:59,378
Yeah, just a, uh, cell phone,
and that soda bottle.

118
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:02,248
Mariquitas Cola?

119
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,900
Mexican soda.

120
00:06:04,902 --> 00:06:06,585
They don't sell that
everywhere.

121
00:06:06,587 --> 00:06:10,923
I think I know
a place that does.

122
00:06:10,925 --> 00:06:13,209
And I know
somebody saw something.

123
00:06:13,211 --> 00:06:15,294
Yeah, getting them to talk
is another matter.

124
00:06:15,296 --> 00:06:17,880
I'm sure you'll charm
something out of them, Fusco.

125
00:06:17,882 --> 00:06:19,799
You know, Carter,

126
00:06:19,801 --> 00:06:21,717
we've been working together
for a while now.

127
00:06:21,719 --> 00:06:24,436
My friends call me "Lionel."
You got a first name?

128
00:06:24,438 --> 00:06:27,189
Sure.
"Detective."

129
00:06:28,591 --> 00:06:32,144
My name's Detective Fusco
with the NYPD.

130
00:06:32,146 --> 00:06:33,779
If anyone has seen
or heard anything

131
00:06:33,781 --> 00:06:35,314
pertaining to what happened
here tonight,

132
00:06:35,316 --> 00:06:37,983
you can call me at--

133
00:06:37,985 --> 00:06:39,735
- I already have
your card, Lionel.

134
00:06:39,737 --> 00:06:42,037
What the hell
are you doing here?

135
00:06:42,039 --> 00:06:43,322
Just checking in.

136
00:06:43,324 --> 00:06:45,825
What happened here?

137
00:06:45,827 --> 00:06:47,326
Lead poisoning.

138
00:06:47,328 --> 00:06:49,829
It's going
around the neighborhood.

139
00:06:52,799 --> 00:06:54,750
NYPD, mister...?

140
00:06:54,752 --> 00:06:57,052
Castillo.
I'm-- I'm closed for the night.

141
00:06:57,054 --> 00:06:59,054
You see what happened
out here tonight, Mr. Castillo?

142
00:06:59,056 --> 00:07:00,422
I was busy in the back.

143
00:07:00,424 --> 00:07:03,509
I-I-I didn't hear anything
till the police showed up.

144
00:07:03,511 --> 00:07:06,095
See, I find that hard
to believe, Mr. Castillo.

145
00:07:06,097 --> 00:07:09,064
After that young man bought
this Mariquitas soda

146
00:07:09,066 --> 00:07:11,433
from your store...

147
00:07:11,435 --> 00:07:14,904
He walked out and got shot
like a dog in the street.

148
00:07:17,107 --> 00:07:19,408
He bought the soda.
He left the store.

149
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:21,327
I heard the shots,
but-- but I didn't see anything.

150
00:07:21,329 --> 00:07:22,912
Okay, so you heard shots.

151
00:07:22,914 --> 00:07:25,080
You didn't look out,
see a car take off?

152
00:07:25,082 --> 00:07:27,533
Please...

153
00:07:27,535 --> 00:07:29,418
Not here.

154
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,704
I understand.

155
00:07:31,706 --> 00:07:32,955
Why don't you come down

156
00:07:32,957 --> 00:07:34,840
to the precinct tomorrow,
give a statement?

157
00:07:34,842 --> 00:07:35,991
Just what you saw.

158
00:07:35,993 --> 00:07:38,794
Okay, I'll come down tomorrow.

159
00:07:48,972 --> 00:07:51,106
Mr. Reese?
Where have you been?

160
00:07:51,108 --> 00:07:53,225
We've got another number.

161
00:07:53,227 --> 00:07:55,444
If you're gonna
tell me Ronnie Middleton,

162
00:07:55,446 --> 00:07:56,478
you're a little late, Finch.

163
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,446
Kid's already gone.

164
00:07:57,448 --> 00:07:59,565
What?
Where are you?

165
00:07:59,567 --> 00:08:02,017
At the scene of a homicide,

166
00:08:02,019 --> 00:08:03,852
wondering how
the machine can see one

167
00:08:03,854 --> 00:08:04,937
and miss another.

168
00:08:04,939 --> 00:08:06,238
I'm sorry, Mr. Reese.

169
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,625
The machine detects acts
of premeditation.

170
00:08:09,627 --> 00:08:11,327
And I'm afraid we've got
a big problem

171
00:08:11,329 --> 00:08:13,162
with the one
it's seeing right now.

172
00:08:13,164 --> 00:08:15,798
Whose number came up?

173
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,217
Mutual friend of ours...

174
00:08:19,869 --> 00:08:22,087
Detective Carter.

175
00:08:39,328 --> 00:08:41,829
Want to tell me
where you were last night?

176
00:08:41,831 --> 00:08:43,648
I was about to ask you
the same thing.

177
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:45,950
- Working a new case.
- There you go.

178
00:08:45,952 --> 00:08:47,335
Thank you.

179
00:08:47,337 --> 00:08:49,253
And I don't have the curfew.

180
00:08:49,255 --> 00:08:51,372
You weren't home when I called,

181
00:08:51,374 --> 00:08:53,073
and you didn't answer
your cell, Taylor.

182
00:08:53,075 --> 00:08:54,675
I was only a half an hour late.

183
00:08:54,677 --> 00:08:56,410
Yeah. You're staying
with grandma

184
00:08:56,412 --> 00:08:58,096
till I'm off this case.

185
00:08:58,098 --> 00:08:59,597
- Hey, Taylor.
- Mmm.

186
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:06,687
So I saw you got that,
uh, homecoming dance

187
00:09:06,689 --> 00:09:07,755
coming up Friday.

188
00:09:07,757 --> 00:09:09,607
You gonna go?

189
00:09:09,609 --> 00:09:11,809
Yeah, it must be tough
being a freshman.

190
00:09:11,811 --> 00:09:13,895
All the girls going out
with the older guys.

191
00:09:13,897 --> 00:09:16,430
I already asked somebody.

192
00:09:16,432 --> 00:09:18,282
- Really?
- Yeah.

193
00:09:18,284 --> 00:09:19,617
Well, I want to meet her.

194
00:09:19,619 --> 00:09:21,068
- I'm gonna be late for school.
- Uh-uh.

195
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:22,320
I'm taking you.
I have time.

196
00:09:22,322 --> 00:09:24,739
Stay.

197
00:09:24,741 --> 00:09:27,942
I thought I charged this thing.

198
00:09:27,944 --> 00:09:30,044
- After you.
- Thank you.

199
00:09:30,046 --> 00:09:32,079
Raised you well.

200
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:37,552
Did you know she had a son?

201
00:09:37,554 --> 00:09:38,836
Didn't know you cared.

202
00:09:38,838 --> 00:09:41,172
No dad in the picture
for some time.

203
00:09:41,174 --> 00:09:44,976
You been looking
into the detective, Mr. Reese?

204
00:09:44,978 --> 00:09:47,595
It pays to know the person
coming after you, Finch.

205
00:09:47,597 --> 00:09:51,315
Okay, they're leaving now.
You'd better hurry up.

206
00:09:51,317 --> 00:09:52,299
Almost got it.

207
00:09:52,301 --> 00:09:55,570
Forget it.
Get out of there now.

208
00:10:00,492 --> 00:10:03,778
Do we have picture?

209
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:06,747
And a GPS tracker.

210
00:10:06,749 --> 00:10:08,249
Nice work, Harold.

211
00:10:08,251 --> 00:10:10,134
We need eyes and ears
on her 24-7,

212
00:10:10,136 --> 00:10:11,819
even inside the precinct.

213
00:10:18,494 --> 00:10:23,047
Finch, Carter's going
right into Hector's shop.

214
00:10:23,049 --> 00:10:25,666
Primary suspect in
the Ronnie Middleton shooting.

215
00:10:25,668 --> 00:10:28,970
How's the car business, Hector?

216
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:34,025
You say that like
you really care, detective.

217
00:10:34,027 --> 00:10:35,693
Care about where
you were last night.

218
00:10:35,695 --> 00:10:38,679
Go ahead, spin that yarn,
dazzle me.

219
00:10:38,681 --> 00:10:41,482
Sorry.
I'm a domesticated man.

220
00:10:41,484 --> 00:10:44,368
I was back with my old lady,
watching some show.

221
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:46,687
- Ask her.
- Of course.

222
00:10:46,689 --> 00:10:50,041
Always with the loyal alibi.

223
00:10:50,043 --> 00:10:52,860
You know, Monica, he's handsome,
but you can do better.

224
00:10:52,862 --> 00:10:55,379
You got some <i>huevos</i> coming
down here all alone, lady.

225
00:10:55,381 --> 00:10:57,215
So that wasn't your muscle car

226
00:10:57,217 --> 00:10:59,250
took a detour into
Washington Heights last night?

227
00:10:59,252 --> 00:11:01,702
Nah, I hear
it's dangerous down there.

228
00:11:01,704 --> 00:11:03,337
I know y'all heard

229
00:11:03,339 --> 00:11:06,007
what happened
to Ronnie Middleton.

230
00:11:06,009 --> 00:11:09,894
I heard he ate a bullet
that didn't agree with him.

231
00:11:09,896 --> 00:11:14,381
Nice shop, nice tools.

232
00:11:14,383 --> 00:11:17,401
Doing well for yourself,
Hector.

233
00:11:17,403 --> 00:11:19,520
You make all this money
fixing up old cars?

234
00:11:19,522 --> 00:11:21,789
I got a record.
I got to work for myself.

235
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:23,824
This is a nice ride.
You mind if I check it out?

236
00:11:23,826 --> 00:11:25,660
Sure as hell do.

237
00:11:25,662 --> 00:11:28,279
You're gonna need
a warrant for that.

238
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:33,668
You messed up,
taking that kid out, Hector.

239
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:35,920
It's a shame
what happened to that kid...

240
00:11:35,922 --> 00:11:38,072
Even if he was
a punk-ass snitch.

241
00:11:38,074 --> 00:11:40,741
You won't get away
with it again.

242
00:11:40,743 --> 00:11:44,462
I will find a way
to bring you down.

243
00:11:44,464 --> 00:11:48,683
Good luck with
that warrant, detective.

244
00:11:57,726 --> 00:12:01,479
Didn't know
you collected dolls, Finch.

245
00:12:01,481 --> 00:12:04,865
As you know, I collect
rare books, Mr. Reese.

246
00:12:04,867 --> 00:12:06,484
180-gram vinyl

247
00:12:06,486 --> 00:12:10,771
and a Xerox Alto
when I can find one.

248
00:12:10,773 --> 00:12:14,659
This doll is
for Detective Fusco.

249
00:12:14,661 --> 00:12:16,494
Fusco's into dolls?

250
00:12:16,496 --> 00:12:19,780
He is now, if we want to
keep eyes on Detective Carter.

251
00:12:19,782 --> 00:12:21,799
I'll make sure
it lands on his desk.

252
00:12:21,801 --> 00:12:26,337
I've been looking
into our new number.

253
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:30,091
Carter, detective first grade,
homicide task force.

254
00:12:30,093 --> 00:12:31,842
Single mom, teenage son,

255
00:12:31,844 --> 00:12:34,645
served as an army interrogator.

256
00:12:34,647 --> 00:12:35,796
Passed the bar in '04,

257
00:12:35,798 --> 00:12:37,348
gave it up to go back
on the force.

258
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:40,001
- It's impressive, Mr. Reese.
- Impressive lady.

259
00:12:40,003 --> 00:12:41,268
Honest to a fault.

260
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:43,237
Which means she made
a lot of enemies,

261
00:12:43,239 --> 00:12:45,923
both in the criminal world
and in her own department.

262
00:12:45,925 --> 00:12:47,641
I've narrowed the list
of possible suspects

263
00:12:47,643 --> 00:12:51,912
to a little over 300 or so.

264
00:12:51,914 --> 00:12:53,748
Day in the life
of a homicide detective.

265
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,499
Any more immediate threats?

266
00:12:57,836 --> 00:13:00,604
Hector Alvarez...

267
00:13:00,606 --> 00:13:01,956
Indicted for homicide

268
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:04,208
on a case she worked
six months ago...

269
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:05,593
Till the charges were dropped.

270
00:13:05,595 --> 00:13:09,296
Edward Kovach--
Repeat felon, spouse abuser,

271
00:13:09,298 --> 00:13:11,349
whose wife she's taken
a keen interest in protecting.

272
00:13:11,351 --> 00:13:12,666
And then there's Elias--

273
00:13:12,668 --> 00:13:14,785
Ruthless killer,
organized crime boss,

274
00:13:14,787 --> 00:13:16,937
who's already taken
a shot at her.

275
00:13:16,939 --> 00:13:18,356
Well, she's a walking target.

276
00:13:18,358 --> 00:13:20,674
Gonna have to keep her
in sight at all times.

277
00:13:20,676 --> 00:13:21,842
You have to be careful.

278
00:13:21,844 --> 00:13:23,644
Get too close,
you risk getting caught.

279
00:13:23,646 --> 00:13:25,863
That's a chance I got to take.

280
00:13:25,865 --> 00:13:27,982
What am I supposed to do,
let her catch a bullet?

281
00:13:27,984 --> 00:13:29,533
What will you do
if she catches you?

282
00:13:29,535 --> 00:13:33,520
Well, I'm sure you'll figure
something out, Harold.

283
00:13:47,386 --> 00:13:48,719
What the hell?

284
00:13:54,342 --> 00:13:56,010
Detective Fusco.

285
00:13:56,012 --> 00:13:58,145
Happy birthday, Lionel.

286
00:13:58,147 --> 00:14:00,931
Thanks, but no thanks.
It's not my birthday.

287
00:14:00,933 --> 00:14:03,067
I don't know what the hell
you're trying to tell me here.

288
00:14:03,069 --> 00:14:05,686
Just putt on your desk
and face it towards Carter.

289
00:14:05,688 --> 00:14:07,054
Why?

290
00:14:07,056 --> 00:14:08,388
'Cause there's a camera inside,

291
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:10,825
and we need to know
everyone she's talking to.

292
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:15,329
You know something I don't?

293
00:14:15,331 --> 00:14:18,532
- She in trouble?
- Well, you tell me.

294
00:14:18,534 --> 00:14:20,501
Ask around with some
of your corrupt pals

295
00:14:20,503 --> 00:14:21,752
inside the force.

296
00:14:21,754 --> 00:14:23,788
Hey, what's going on?
What do you need?

297
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:25,623
I need to find out
who might want

298
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:26,891
- to take Carter out.
- Whoa, wait a minute.

299
00:14:26,893 --> 00:14:28,676
I can't be involved
in something like that.

300
00:14:28,678 --> 00:14:31,879
No, Lionel, just turn
the camera towards her desk.

301
00:14:33,932 --> 00:14:37,017
Nice doll.

302
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:41,305
Yeah, my, uh--
My son gave it to me.

303
00:14:41,307 --> 00:14:43,390
How'd it go with the old Don
at the big house?

304
00:14:43,392 --> 00:14:44,642
Tried to reach out,

305
00:14:44,644 --> 00:14:46,977
see what he knew
about his biological son.

306
00:14:46,979 --> 00:14:50,531
- Elias, huh?
- Old man just shut me down.

307
00:14:50,533 --> 00:14:52,817
Seems to think
every cop is dirty.

308
00:14:52,819 --> 00:14:55,319
Yeah.

309
00:14:55,321 --> 00:14:56,987
Maybe back in his day.

310
00:14:56,989 --> 00:14:59,323
That bodega owner Castillo
come in yet?

311
00:14:59,325 --> 00:15:01,158
- Not that I know of.
- Huh.

312
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,961
Gonna have to pay him
another visit.

313
00:15:03,963 --> 00:15:05,412
You coming?

314
00:15:05,414 --> 00:15:06,714
Nah, you know what?

315
00:15:06,716 --> 00:15:08,632
Why don't you, uh, go ahead?
I-I got a thing.

316
00:15:08,634 --> 00:15:10,284
I'll catch up
with you later, okay?

317
00:15:10,286 --> 00:15:12,253
Okay.

318
00:15:24,984 --> 00:15:26,784
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

319
00:15:26,786 --> 00:15:28,319
- Come here.
- Yo, I ain't done nothing.

320
00:15:28,321 --> 00:15:30,321
- Hands where I can see 'em.
- Get off.

321
00:15:30,323 --> 00:15:32,472
Got any needles?
Anything that's gonna stick me?

322
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:34,641
This is violation
of my civil liberties.

323
00:15:34,643 --> 00:15:36,160
Finch, I don't like
the looks of this.

324
00:15:36,162 --> 00:15:37,411
Aah!

325
00:15:37,413 --> 00:15:39,446
Bitch, you better
get your hands off me.

326
00:15:39,448 --> 00:15:42,666
Shut up and get your head down.

327
00:15:42,668 --> 00:15:46,203
Yo, thanks for making it
look good, detective.

328
00:15:46,205 --> 00:15:47,872
I think I tweaked
my wrist, man.

329
00:15:47,874 --> 00:15:50,374
That was a little
too theatrical, Bottlecap.

330
00:15:50,376 --> 00:15:51,642
- Hey--
- Wait a minute, Reese.

331
00:15:51,644 --> 00:15:52,843
I think she knows him.

332
00:15:52,845 --> 00:15:54,345
It's all for show.

333
00:15:54,347 --> 00:15:56,580
Must be one of her CIS.

334
00:15:56,582 --> 00:15:58,632
That's 'cause
after I last got popped,

335
00:15:58,634 --> 00:16:01,018
I used my time
to rehabilitate myself.

336
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,219
You got clean?

337
00:16:02,221 --> 00:16:04,305
- Come on now, BC.
- I'm serious.

338
00:16:04,307 --> 00:16:06,106
These pipes are junk-free.

339
00:16:06,108 --> 00:16:08,025
But I can always use
some scratch,

340
00:16:08,027 --> 00:16:09,109
you know what I'm saying?

341
00:16:09,111 --> 00:16:11,028
I need to know
what you've heard

342
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:14,815
about the new guy Elias.

343
00:16:14,817 --> 00:16:18,518
Yeah, I've been hearing
that name up and coming a lot.

344
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,820
I never seen him,

345
00:16:19,822 --> 00:16:23,874
but I-I hear he's a man
not to be trifled with.

346
00:16:23,876 --> 00:16:26,911
You, um, know anything
about that shooting last night

347
00:16:26,913 --> 00:16:28,579
over on 168th and Audubon?

348
00:16:28,581 --> 00:16:30,464
Drive-by, right?

349
00:16:30,466 --> 00:16:32,699
I know the block,
just not the players.

350
00:16:32,701 --> 00:16:34,919
You ever hear the name
Hector Alvarez come up

351
00:16:34,921 --> 00:16:37,721
or see him cruise
the block in his GTO?

352
00:16:37,723 --> 00:16:41,708
I didn't see the car or hear
nobody talk about Hector,

353
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,761
but I can ask around.

354
00:16:43,763 --> 00:16:45,846
Good looking out, BC.

355
00:16:45,848 --> 00:16:49,883
If you get anything back
on, um, Hector or Elias,

356
00:16:49,885 --> 00:16:53,404
there's more
where that came from.

357
00:17:01,363 --> 00:17:02,830
Hey, captain.

358
00:17:02,832 --> 00:17:04,731
Welcome back, detective.

359
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:07,567
Didn't think you'd grace us
with your presence again

360
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:10,671
once you spent time
with the perfumed folk downtown.

361
00:17:11,841 --> 00:17:13,624
How'd a half-wit like you
pull that off?

362
00:17:13,626 --> 00:17:15,960
I guess the half's still
got some juice, huh, captain?

363
00:17:17,246 --> 00:17:19,246
They got me working
with Detective Carter,

364
00:17:19,248 --> 00:17:20,764
and, uh...

365
00:17:20,766 --> 00:17:22,516
I'm starting
to hear some things.

366
00:17:22,518 --> 00:17:24,935
Yeah?
Like what?

367
00:17:24,937 --> 00:17:26,687
Maybe she's not
so well-liked

368
00:17:26,689 --> 00:17:29,857
by, uh, a certain element.

369
00:17:29,859 --> 00:17:32,776
Listen, Lionel...

370
00:17:32,778 --> 00:17:34,695
Things are going back
to the way they used to be.

371
00:17:34,697 --> 00:17:36,146
Used to be?

372
00:17:36,148 --> 00:17:38,616
Thing about organized crime?
It was organized.

373
00:17:38,618 --> 00:17:41,735
Things worked.
Trains ran on time.

374
00:17:41,737 --> 00:17:44,538
This new guy...

375
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:45,823
He knows the rules.

376
00:17:45,825 --> 00:17:48,492
New guy--
You mean Elias.

377
00:17:48,494 --> 00:17:50,878
Runs a tight ship...

378
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,296
Low profile.

379
00:17:52,298 --> 00:17:54,581
Not like these cutthroat
Russian idiots.

380
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:56,283
He knows who to grease...

381
00:17:56,285 --> 00:17:58,618
All the way up to city hall.

382
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,888
Look, the economy's
in the toilet.

383
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:04,091
Detective Carter
doesn't understand the rules.

384
00:18:04,093 --> 00:18:07,111
She's bad for business.

385
00:18:07,113 --> 00:18:09,179
- What'd she do?
- Sniffing around...

386
00:18:09,181 --> 00:18:10,981
Trying to build a case.

387
00:18:10,983 --> 00:18:14,518
She's gunning for Elias.
She's got to go.

388
00:18:15,987 --> 00:18:17,738
It's a tricky business,
getting rid of a cop.

389
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:20,741
Went through
the proper back channels...

390
00:18:20,743 --> 00:18:23,277
Up the chain of command.

391
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:24,695
Permission granted.

392
00:18:24,697 --> 00:18:26,580
It's just got to look...

393
00:18:26,582 --> 00:18:27,865
Clean.

394
00:18:27,867 --> 00:18:29,583
"Clean"?

395
00:18:29,585 --> 00:18:32,986
You mean like
in the line of duty?

396
00:18:32,988 --> 00:18:36,590
I'm starting to feel caught
in the middle here, captain.

397
00:18:36,592 --> 00:18:39,426
I'd keep my distance,
if I were you.

398
00:18:49,504 --> 00:18:52,206
You didn't come down
to the precinct

399
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:54,975
like you told me you would,
Mr. Castillo.

400
00:18:54,977 --> 00:18:57,677
I got no help today.
I'm a very busy man.

401
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,230
Did you see this car
before or after the shooting?

402
00:19:00,232 --> 00:19:03,400
You didn't tell me that
the guy that they killed

403
00:19:03,402 --> 00:19:05,352
was a witness
to another shooting.

404
00:19:05,354 --> 00:19:08,072
He decided not to testify.
Didn't save him.

405
00:19:08,074 --> 00:19:10,040
If you think
that's gonna convince me to,

406
00:19:10,042 --> 00:19:11,709
- it's not helping.
- The point is...

407
00:19:11,711 --> 00:19:15,579
If Hector Alvarez thinks
you saw him shoot someone,

408
00:19:15,581 --> 00:19:17,715
he's gonna come after you too.

409
00:19:17,717 --> 00:19:20,918
Please.
Look, I have a family.

410
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,252
Exactly.

411
00:19:22,254 --> 00:19:24,054
If you help me,

412
00:19:24,056 --> 00:19:26,306
I can protect you
and your family.

413
00:19:26,308 --> 00:19:28,842
If you don't...

414
00:19:28,844 --> 00:19:32,379
He could still come after you.

415
00:19:32,381 --> 00:19:34,314
What's the word, Lionel?

416
00:19:34,316 --> 00:19:36,934
I did some checking around.

417
00:19:36,936 --> 00:19:39,937
Carter's name came up
and not in a good way.

418
00:19:39,939 --> 00:19:41,888
Elias wants her gone...
Today.

419
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,941
Killing a cop
brings a lot of heat.

420
00:19:43,943 --> 00:19:46,110
Yeah, which is why they're
gonna make it look clean.

421
00:19:46,112 --> 00:19:47,861
He could set up a patsy
or pay someone off

422
00:19:47,863 --> 00:19:49,947
on a case she's working.

423
00:19:49,949 --> 00:19:52,166
All I know is, every door
that Carter walks through

424
00:19:52,168 --> 00:19:53,617
could have a bullet behind it.

425
00:19:53,619 --> 00:19:58,255
Did you see this guy
in your store last night?

426
00:19:58,257 --> 00:20:01,708
Please.
That's all I need.

427
00:20:06,214 --> 00:20:07,581
I saw him earlier.

428
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:12,219
He's been in my store before,
to buy condoms, beer.

429
00:20:12,221 --> 00:20:13,470
What does it mater?

430
00:20:13,472 --> 00:20:15,189
I'm not gonna give you
a statement anyways.

431
00:20:15,191 --> 00:20:18,058
- Can you please leave my store?
- Okay.

432
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:21,311
Okay.
Thank you.

433
00:20:27,236 --> 00:20:29,653
Oh, sorry, detective.

434
00:20:29,655 --> 00:20:32,239
I didn't realize
that was you from behind.

435
00:20:32,241 --> 00:20:34,374
Lot of fine girls out today.

436
00:20:34,376 --> 00:20:36,043
Keep it moving, lover boy.

437
00:20:36,045 --> 00:20:37,828
You got to be careful
on this block.

438
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:41,248
I heard some kid
got popped last night.

439
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:44,168
You got any kids, detective?

440
00:20:46,254 --> 00:20:47,454
Stay off this block.

441
00:20:47,456 --> 00:20:50,224
I see this car roll by
one more time,

442
00:20:50,226 --> 00:20:51,475
I'm gonna impound it.

443
00:20:51,477 --> 00:20:54,094
I'll be seeing you around,
Mr. Castillo.

444
00:20:57,516 --> 00:21:00,184
Get out of here.

445
00:21:00,186 --> 00:21:02,236
Let's go.

446
00:21:14,752 --> 00:21:16,336
Elias wants Carter gone.

447
00:21:16,338 --> 00:21:19,039
Possible he'll use
someone with motive...

448
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:22,242
The suspect in one
of her cases.

449
00:21:24,879 --> 00:21:26,196
Carter's at a bar.

450
00:21:26,198 --> 00:21:28,048
I thought she was on duty.

451
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:30,383
With this many people
after her,

452
00:21:30,385 --> 00:21:32,969
I'd be inclined
to pick up the tab.

453
00:21:36,273 --> 00:21:39,025
Tell me, Eddie...

454
00:21:39,027 --> 00:21:41,861
What kind of degenerate
does that to his wife?

455
00:21:41,863 --> 00:21:44,030
Carter's paying Kovach a visit.

456
00:21:44,032 --> 00:21:47,567
Why is a homicide detective
intervening in a domestic case?

457
00:21:47,569 --> 00:21:49,185
Maybe she's like us.

458
00:21:49,187 --> 00:21:51,821
Trying to prevent
something bad from happening.

459
00:21:54,542 --> 00:21:57,377
What happens between a man and
his woman behind closed doors

460
00:21:57,379 --> 00:21:59,212
is none of your damn business.

461
00:21:59,214 --> 00:22:01,214
Can't stop you
from boozing your life away.

462
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:04,334
But you go home and put
your hands on your wife again,

463
00:22:04,336 --> 00:22:05,585
I'm coming after you.

464
00:22:05,587 --> 00:22:07,387
You come after me,

465
00:22:07,389 --> 00:22:11,424
and I will exercise
my second amendment rights.

466
00:22:11,426 --> 00:22:15,762
And I promise you,
I got a pretty big gun.

467
00:22:15,764 --> 00:22:19,566
Man as angry
and bitter as you are...

468
00:22:21,185 --> 00:22:25,989
I got a feeling
it ain't that big, Eddie.

469
00:22:28,659 --> 00:22:32,328
I got to admit, Finch,
I sure like her style.

470
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:36,449
I think we got
a new front-runner.

471
00:22:40,237 --> 00:22:42,956
Mark Thomson,

472
00:22:42,958 --> 00:22:45,074
Ricky Lopez,

473
00:22:45,076 --> 00:22:47,177
Joseph McNally...

474
00:22:47,179 --> 00:22:50,880
All were killed
from a suicide vest

475
00:22:50,882 --> 00:22:53,383
you helped transport.

476
00:22:53,385 --> 00:22:56,136
They had families...

477
00:22:56,138 --> 00:22:58,488
People that loved them.

478
00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:01,357
I'm sorry for the soldiers,

479
00:23:01,359 --> 00:23:03,326
but I deliver vegetables.

480
00:23:03,328 --> 00:23:07,997
I know you're working
with Al-Qaeda, Yusuf...

481
00:23:07,999 --> 00:23:09,599
'Cause I have photos here

482
00:23:09,601 --> 00:23:12,602
of you loading vests
into your truck.

483
00:23:12,604 --> 00:23:14,904
Now, you want to tell me

484
00:23:14,906 --> 00:23:17,657
all these photos
of you are fake?

485
00:23:17,659 --> 00:23:19,042
Hmm?

486
00:23:19,044 --> 00:23:23,379
Show me where the other
suicide vests are hidden, Yusuf.

487
00:23:23,381 --> 00:23:25,131
Point to the location.

488
00:23:29,953 --> 00:23:32,755
Do you know what they will do

489
00:23:32,757 --> 00:23:36,176
if they find out
that I helped you?

490
00:23:36,178 --> 00:23:38,845
They will kill my wife.

491
00:23:38,847 --> 00:23:41,581
They will kill my son.

492
00:23:41,583 --> 00:23:44,484
I would rather
you just kill me now.

493
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:01,935
Carter, is that
the DOA's phone--

494
00:24:01,937 --> 00:24:03,169
Ronnie Middleton?

495
00:24:03,171 --> 00:24:05,838
His mother hasn't even come
to the morgue.

496
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,373
This kid was all alone.

497
00:24:07,375 --> 00:24:09,209
He deserved better.

498
00:24:09,211 --> 00:24:12,212
So far, I've got nothing
on Hector.

499
00:24:12,214 --> 00:24:14,047
Analyst from
the real-time crime center

500
00:24:14,049 --> 00:24:15,998
sent over footage
from some of the cameras

501
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,050
around Bodega La Nueva.

502
00:24:17,052 --> 00:24:18,017
Some?

503
00:24:18,019 --> 00:24:19,636
There's more cameras than this?

504
00:24:19,638 --> 00:24:21,337
Yeah. Mayor wants one
on every corner.

505
00:24:21,339 --> 00:24:23,389
Wow, no wonder I feel
like I'm always being watched.

506
00:24:23,391 --> 00:24:26,192
I figured Hector's GTO
had to pass

507
00:24:26,194 --> 00:24:28,478
through this intersection,
but nothing, <i>nada.</i>

508
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,280
Maybe he didn't drive.
Maybe he walked.

509
00:24:30,282 --> 00:24:34,350
Castillo said he came
into his market a couple times

510
00:24:34,352 --> 00:24:37,036
to purchase
some booze and trojans.

511
00:24:37,038 --> 00:24:38,154
So?

512
00:24:38,156 --> 00:24:39,822
His girlfriend lives
in the Bronx too.

513
00:24:39,824 --> 00:24:43,192
Why would he have to go
25 blocks downtown for condoms?

514
00:24:43,194 --> 00:24:46,879
'Cause Don Juan got
a little chicky on the side.

515
00:24:46,881 --> 00:24:48,715
Hmm.

516
00:24:48,717 --> 00:24:50,667
Hector was on foot.

517
00:24:50,669 --> 00:24:53,670
Maybe he walked from
her apartment to the market.

518
00:24:53,672 --> 00:24:55,588
And that's where Hector
bumped into Ronnie.

519
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:56,973
If we can find this <i>chica,</i>

520
00:24:56,975 --> 00:24:58,641
we might have ourselves
a new witness.

521
00:24:58,643 --> 00:25:00,093
I'm gonna make some phone calls.

522
00:25:00,095 --> 00:25:01,043
Look, I got to go.

523
00:25:01,045 --> 00:25:02,061
You can thank me later,
all right?

524
00:25:03,315 --> 00:25:05,064
Hello.
What, do you miss me already?

525
00:25:05,066 --> 00:25:06,733
You're a hard man
to miss, Lionel.

526
00:25:06,735 --> 00:25:08,851
I'd say this Carter
situation's got you worried.

527
00:25:08,853 --> 00:25:11,404
What are you gonna do,
follow her around from now on?

528
00:25:11,406 --> 00:25:13,439
I'm not.
You are.

529
00:25:13,441 --> 00:25:16,326
I've got some business
to take care of.

530
00:25:16,328 --> 00:25:18,411
Don't let her get
in any trouble.

531
00:25:18,413 --> 00:25:19,445
Carter's gunning for you.

532
00:25:19,447 --> 00:25:20,997
Hell, she's probably
gonna catch you.

533
00:25:20,999 --> 00:25:23,366
Why you spending so much time
trying to protect her?

534
00:25:23,368 --> 00:25:25,418
She's a good cop...

535
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:27,537
Good person.

536
00:25:27,539 --> 00:25:29,839
Hell, you should
try it sometime, Lionel.

537
00:25:29,841 --> 00:25:31,407
Yeah, thanks,
look, I'm just saying,

538
00:25:31,409 --> 00:25:33,126
if she wasn't around,
it would probably solve

539
00:25:33,128 --> 00:25:34,994
a lot of your problems,
now, wouldn't it?

540
00:25:34,996 --> 00:25:36,912
If anything happens
to her, Lionel,

541
00:25:36,914 --> 00:25:38,598
I'm coming for you next.

542
00:25:47,374 --> 00:25:48,691
What the--

543
00:26:00,871 --> 00:26:03,206
Knock, knock.

544
00:26:03,208 --> 00:26:04,657
What do we have here?

545
00:26:04,659 --> 00:26:08,378
Hector's a busy man--
Fixing cars and running guns.

546
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:11,414
Who are you, man?

547
00:26:11,416 --> 00:26:14,300
Tell Hector I'm the guy that
just put him out of business.

548
00:26:17,671 --> 00:26:20,973
If I see him again, I'll close
down more than the shop.

549
00:26:41,312 --> 00:26:42,828
If you help us,

550
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:46,165
I can protect you
and your family.

551
00:26:46,167 --> 00:26:49,068
I promise.

552
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:52,521
This is just
a negotiation for you.

553
00:26:52,523 --> 00:26:55,574
You don't care
about me or my family.

554
00:26:55,576 --> 00:27:00,279
Your son--
He's named after you.

555
00:27:00,281 --> 00:27:02,114
He's turning 8
in 14 days, right?

556
00:27:02,116 --> 00:27:05,167
Favorite sport?
Soccer.

557
00:27:05,169 --> 00:27:08,004
But it's too dangerous
to play in the field by you.

558
00:27:08,006 --> 00:27:10,256
Your only brother, Naji,

559
00:27:10,258 --> 00:27:13,643
was killed nine months ago
by an IED.

560
00:27:13,645 --> 00:27:18,014
You visit his grave every day.

561
00:27:18,016 --> 00:27:21,684
So, you see...

562
00:27:21,686 --> 00:27:25,905
You are not
just a negotiation...

563
00:27:25,907 --> 00:27:28,074
Not to me.

564
00:27:30,977 --> 00:27:32,578
Do you have children?

565
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:35,197
A son.
Taylor.

566
00:27:35,199 --> 00:27:37,983
Would you trust his life
to a complete stranger?

567
00:27:37,985 --> 00:27:41,620
I'd do whatever was
in my power to protect him.

568
00:27:41,622 --> 00:27:44,957
You lost your brother, Yusuf.

569
00:27:46,878 --> 00:27:50,880
I lost someone
very close to me too.

570
00:27:50,882 --> 00:27:54,383
It changed everything.

571
00:27:54,385 --> 00:27:55,634
You and me...

572
00:27:55,636 --> 00:27:57,720
We're not that different.

573
00:27:57,722 --> 00:27:58,804
No.

574
00:27:58,806 --> 00:28:01,006
We want the same thing.

575
00:28:01,008 --> 00:28:03,675
For our children
to walk down the street

576
00:28:03,677 --> 00:28:07,947
and not be afraid.

577
00:28:07,949 --> 00:28:12,851
Show me where
those explosives are.

578
00:28:18,358 --> 00:28:20,876
The location is not on the map.

579
00:28:20,878 --> 00:28:23,913
Then you'll take us to them.

580
00:28:23,915 --> 00:28:26,215
For our children.

581
00:28:29,419 --> 00:28:32,254
For our children.

582
00:28:41,732 --> 00:28:44,049
Hey, BC.

583
00:28:44,051 --> 00:28:46,569
You got anything
on Hector's new woman?

584
00:28:46,571 --> 00:28:49,388
Relax.
Fusco's all right.

585
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:51,490
Easy there, hubcap.
I don't bite.

586
00:28:51,492 --> 00:28:55,227
All right,
let's make this quick.

587
00:28:55,229 --> 00:28:58,080
I seen Hector's GTO
outside the lookie-loo.

588
00:28:58,082 --> 00:29:02,034
Turns out he's bumping
one of the dancers-- Mei Li.

589
00:29:02,036 --> 00:29:04,870
If you ask ask me, Hector got
a little tired of his <i>chica</i>

590
00:29:04,872 --> 00:29:07,072
and wanted some strange.

591
00:29:07,074 --> 00:29:09,759
You done good.

592
00:29:09,761 --> 00:29:13,379
Uh, I thought you said...

593
00:29:13,381 --> 00:29:15,080
You know, real money...

594
00:29:15,082 --> 00:29:16,298
Reward money.

595
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:17,600
Okay.

596
00:29:17,602 --> 00:29:20,636
Well, if this pans out, I will
get you that reward money.

597
00:29:20,638 --> 00:29:22,421
I'll meet you later,

598
00:29:22,423 --> 00:29:24,607
even take you to dinner
at your favorite spot.

599
00:29:24,609 --> 00:29:26,525
All right.

600
00:29:26,527 --> 00:29:28,694
Yeah, but only 'cause it's you.

601
00:29:28,696 --> 00:29:30,563
You always been
good to me, Carter.

602
00:29:30,565 --> 00:29:32,448
Okay.
Take care.

603
00:29:34,451 --> 00:29:36,986
Yes, me and Hector
was together all night.

604
00:29:36,988 --> 00:29:39,405
We watched tv,
and then we went to bed.

605
00:29:39,407 --> 00:29:41,073
- What'd you watch?
- I don't know.

606
00:29:41,075 --> 00:29:42,958
Hector's always changing
the channels.

607
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,827
I heard that about that guy.

608
00:29:44,829 --> 00:29:47,546
He gets bored, he likes
to switch it up, huh?

609
00:29:47,548 --> 00:29:51,000
Is that why he has
that other girl on the side?

610
00:29:51,002 --> 00:29:53,252
No, no, no.

611
00:29:53,254 --> 00:29:55,421
You see, my man
don't step out on me.

612
00:29:55,423 --> 00:29:56,639
I'll cut it off.

613
00:29:56,641 --> 00:29:57,723
Ooh, okay.

614
00:29:57,725 --> 00:30:01,560
Come here.
I want you to see something.

615
00:30:01,562 --> 00:30:05,431
That's Hector's
cell phone bill.

616
00:30:05,433 --> 00:30:06,732
You know whose number that is?

617
00:30:06,734 --> 00:30:08,734
'Cause he dialed it 33 times.

618
00:30:08,736 --> 00:30:10,236
I don't know,
it's probably one of his homies.

619
00:30:10,238 --> 00:30:12,021
That man gossips
like a little schoolgirl.

620
00:30:12,023 --> 00:30:13,989
Well, it's easy enough
to find out.

621
00:30:13,991 --> 00:30:15,407
Go ahead.
Dial it.

622
00:30:15,409 --> 00:30:16,942
So you were
with Hector all night.

623
00:30:16,944 --> 00:30:19,645
Last night, this morning.

624
00:30:19,647 --> 00:30:21,497
Hector's a morning person.

625
00:30:21,499 --> 00:30:24,149
He likes to spoon.

626
00:30:24,151 --> 00:30:25,918
Hello?

627
00:30:27,587 --> 00:30:29,171
Hello?

628
00:30:29,173 --> 00:30:30,489
Who is this?

629
00:30:30,491 --> 00:30:33,992
Wait.
Who the hell are you?

630
00:30:33,994 --> 00:30:35,661
Okay, all right.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

631
00:30:35,663 --> 00:30:37,847
Looks like you two
got a lot to sort out.

632
00:30:37,849 --> 00:30:40,432
Uh, make sure
they don't kill each other.

633
00:30:40,434 --> 00:30:41,667
- Oh, no!
- Oh, no!

634
00:30:41,669 --> 00:30:43,869
- You got to be kidding me!
- Aah! Aah!

635
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,640
Carter, looks like
you're not the only one

636
00:30:47,642 --> 00:30:49,007
who's got a beef
with Hector Alvarez.

637
00:30:49,009 --> 00:30:52,194
Some guy came into his body shop
and shot up the place.

638
00:30:52,196 --> 00:30:54,230
Bangers inside got a taste
of their own medicines.

639
00:30:54,232 --> 00:30:56,148
Said the guy had
a submachine gun

640
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:58,617
and a grenade launcher.

641
00:30:58,619 --> 00:31:00,519
You believe that?

642
00:31:00,521 --> 00:31:02,288
This guy wearing a suit?

643
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:04,039
No, motorcycle jacket.
Why?

644
00:31:04,041 --> 00:31:06,242
Maybe it's in the cleaners.

645
00:31:06,244 --> 00:31:07,710
Hector's wanted
for questioning.

646
00:31:07,712 --> 00:31:09,879
Suffice it to say,
he's, uh, disappeared.

647
00:31:11,031 --> 00:31:12,998
Somebody knows where he is.

648
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,702
If I find Hector,
I'll give him your best.

649
00:31:16,704 --> 00:31:19,338
Hector's on the run.

650
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:21,090
He's not gonna be a problem
for Carter anymore.

651
00:31:21,092 --> 00:31:22,374
I'm not so sure about that.

652
00:31:22,376 --> 00:31:24,677
Carter is now determined
to get justice for Ronnie.

653
00:31:24,679 --> 00:31:26,896
One way or another, she will
find where Hector's hiding.

654
00:31:26,898 --> 00:31:29,932
The guy's running guns.

655
00:31:29,934 --> 00:31:32,268
Wherever he is,
he's heavily armed.

656
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:33,736
And when she goes
to arrest him--

657
00:31:33,738 --> 00:31:36,155
- I'll just have
to get there first.

658
00:31:36,157 --> 00:31:39,692
Is everything okay,
Mr. Reese?

659
00:31:42,579 --> 00:31:45,381
We got into this
to stop bad things

660
00:31:45,383 --> 00:31:48,400
from happening to good people.

661
00:31:48,402 --> 00:31:51,704
Carter's been doing that
her whole life.

662
00:31:51,706 --> 00:31:55,140
She's not just
another number, Finch.

663
00:31:56,543 --> 00:32:00,212
Some people the world
can't afford to lose.

664
00:32:00,214 --> 00:32:02,264
Either one of you
ready to make a statement?

665
00:32:02,266 --> 00:32:04,433
Yeah, I got a statement.

666
00:32:04,435 --> 00:32:06,185
Hector Alvarez is a damn fool

667
00:32:06,187 --> 00:32:09,104
if he thinks
he can play us both.

668
00:32:09,106 --> 00:32:11,390
Bastard came to my place,
but he went out around midnight.

669
00:32:11,392 --> 00:32:13,859
- Did he go to the market?
- What he said.

670
00:32:13,861 --> 00:32:16,928
But he came back empty-handed
and changed his shirt.

671
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:19,114
You wash this shirt of his?

672
00:32:19,116 --> 00:32:20,399
Oh, hell, no.

673
00:32:20,401 --> 00:32:24,119
It's all yours
along with all his stuff.

674
00:32:24,121 --> 00:32:27,373
So where is Hector?

675
00:32:27,375 --> 00:32:31,043
He has a warehouse in Queens...

676
00:32:31,045 --> 00:32:32,628
On 25th.

677
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:35,798
He hangs out there sometimes
when he's expecting a shipment.

678
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:38,751
Call ESU, get a ten standby.

679
00:32:38,753 --> 00:32:40,285
I'm gonna see
about getting a warrant.

680
00:32:40,287 --> 00:32:42,254
Hello?

681
00:32:42,256 --> 00:32:43,389
He's got a gun!

682
00:32:43,391 --> 00:32:44,673
Uh, wait a minute.
Calm down.

683
00:32:44,675 --> 00:32:46,158
- I can't understand you.
- He's got a gun!

684
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:48,260
- Get out of there!
- Oh, God! Please!

685
00:32:48,262 --> 00:32:49,961
He's gonna kill me!
Hurry!

686
00:32:49,963 --> 00:32:51,630
Mrs. Kovach, where are you?

687
00:32:51,632 --> 00:32:53,632
- In the bathroom!
- Stay where you are.

688
00:32:53,634 --> 00:32:55,267
I'm gonna come and get you.

689
00:32:55,269 --> 00:32:57,353
Hello? Hello?

690
00:32:57,355 --> 00:32:59,971
Carter's going
to the Kovachs' house.

691
00:32:59,973 --> 00:33:04,109
He's armed,
sounds extremely agitated.

692
00:33:04,111 --> 00:33:06,779
Reese?

693
00:33:06,781 --> 00:33:08,113
Where are you?

694
00:33:08,115 --> 00:33:09,581
All units, we have a code ten.

695
00:33:09,583 --> 00:33:12,484
Shots fired at 326 Greentree
in Flushing.

696
00:33:12,486 --> 00:33:14,536
NYPD, open up!

697
00:33:15,988 --> 00:33:17,506
Sure we shouldn't wait
for backup?

698
00:33:17,508 --> 00:33:19,157
- I got a bad feeling about this.
- Mr. Kovach...

699
00:33:19,159 --> 00:33:22,160
It's the police.
Put down your weapon.

700
00:33:26,666 --> 00:33:30,352
What the hell?

701
00:33:33,139 --> 00:33:34,840
Somebody gift-wrapped him
for us.

702
00:33:34,842 --> 00:33:38,009
Somebody's been doing that
a lot lately.

703
00:33:38,011 --> 00:33:40,195
Mrs. Kovach?

704
00:33:40,197 --> 00:33:42,114
Mrs. Kovach?

705
00:33:47,538 --> 00:33:49,288
Mrs. Kovach,
are you okay?

706
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:52,741
He was gonna kill me.
If that man hadn't shown up--

707
00:33:52,743 --> 00:33:55,044
- "That man"?
What'd he look like?

708
00:33:55,046 --> 00:33:58,163
Hello?

709
00:34:01,584 --> 00:34:04,303
It's for you.

710
00:34:08,007 --> 00:34:10,142
I guess I have you
to thank for this.

711
00:34:10,144 --> 00:34:11,727
How do you always know

712
00:34:11,729 --> 00:34:12,811
when something bad's
about to go down?

713
00:34:12,813 --> 00:34:15,013
You're in trouble, detective.

714
00:34:15,015 --> 00:34:18,383
I'm not the one who's hiding.

715
00:34:18,385 --> 00:34:21,019
Look, you keep playing God,
and sooner or later,

716
00:34:21,021 --> 00:34:22,888
an innocent person's
gonna get hurt.

717
00:34:22,890 --> 00:34:23,989
I can't let that happen.

718
00:34:23,991 --> 00:34:26,075
Listen, I didn't call
to talk about me.

719
00:34:26,077 --> 00:34:27,326
Your life's in danger.

720
00:34:27,328 --> 00:34:30,579
I'm a cop.
My life's always in danger.

721
00:34:30,581 --> 00:34:32,081
You're not listening to me.

722
00:34:32,083 --> 00:34:35,000
I'm trying to tell you
someone wants you dead.

723
00:34:36,786 --> 00:34:39,237
Who told you that?

724
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:42,091
Why are you following me?
What do you want?

725
00:34:42,093 --> 00:34:44,176
I want you to start
being more careful.

726
00:34:44,178 --> 00:34:47,179
For instance, if you're gonna
take down Hector Alvarez,

727
00:34:47,181 --> 00:34:49,181
you should know
the man's running guns.

728
00:34:49,183 --> 00:34:51,600
He has an arsenal
at his fingertips.

729
00:34:51,602 --> 00:34:54,586
What-- Why are you
helping me?

730
00:34:54,588 --> 00:34:57,422
And how do you keep finding out
all of this information?

731
00:34:57,424 --> 00:34:58,757
Like you said...

732
00:34:58,759 --> 00:35:01,426
I always seem to know.

733
00:35:20,964 --> 00:35:22,548
I never saw his face.

734
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:24,166
He came out of nowhere.

735
00:35:24,168 --> 00:35:27,336
He attacked me.
You people can't arrest me.

736
00:35:27,338 --> 00:35:28,337
Yes, we can.

737
00:35:28,339 --> 00:35:31,757
Your wife is pressing charges,
Eddie.

738
00:35:31,759 --> 00:35:33,625
We get a warrant
on Hector Alvarez yet?

739
00:35:33,627 --> 00:35:37,813
Yep, ESU's standing by.
Who died?

740
00:35:59,008 --> 00:36:01,710
Finch, Carter's
called an ESU unit

741
00:36:01,712 --> 00:36:03,879
to Hector's warehouse
in queens.

742
00:36:03,881 --> 00:36:06,849
They're getting ready to knock
on the door as we speak.

743
00:36:11,054 --> 00:36:12,955
It's time to roll.
Stay here.

744
00:36:12,957 --> 00:36:15,641
I'll advise you when we have
Alvarez apprehended.

745
00:36:15,643 --> 00:36:17,359
You have eyes on Carter?

746
00:36:17,361 --> 00:36:19,144
She's clear
of the line of fire.

747
00:36:19,146 --> 00:36:21,480
If Hector puts up a fight,
it could be dangerous.

748
00:36:21,482 --> 00:36:23,782
How will you be close enough
to protect her?

749
00:36:23,784 --> 00:36:24,783
Oh, I'm...

750
00:36:24,785 --> 00:36:26,068
Pretty close.

751
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:27,653
They got this place
covered, right?

752
00:36:27,655 --> 00:36:28,704
Absolutely.

753
00:36:28,706 --> 00:36:30,372
Cover's going in.

754
00:36:30,374 --> 00:36:31,874
- Everybody set?
- Yes, sir.

755
00:36:31,876 --> 00:36:33,959
Open it.

756
00:36:33,961 --> 00:36:35,544
Do it.

757
00:36:35,546 --> 00:36:37,546
Move! Move! Move!
NYPD!

758
00:36:37,548 --> 00:36:40,782
Down on the ground now!

759
00:36:40,784 --> 00:36:43,502
That doesn't sound good.

760
00:36:46,557 --> 00:36:50,175
You hear something around back?

761
00:37:09,579 --> 00:37:11,780
Get out of the car.

762
00:37:11,782 --> 00:37:13,699
Suspect apprehended.

763
00:37:13,701 --> 00:37:15,317
Take it easy.

764
00:37:15,319 --> 00:37:17,169
Everything all right,
Mr. Reese?

765
00:37:17,171 --> 00:37:18,820
Hector's got
a new set of bracelets.

766
00:37:18,822 --> 00:37:21,673
Should keep him busy
for a while.

767
00:37:21,675 --> 00:37:23,509
That's for Ronnie.

768
00:37:23,511 --> 00:37:27,162
- I told you I'd get you.
- Oh, God.

769
00:37:28,664 --> 00:37:31,049
Hey, Taylor, baby.
I'm running a little late.

770
00:37:31,051 --> 00:37:34,686
I'll be there soon.

771
00:37:34,688 --> 00:37:37,389
Sounds like Carter's
headed home.

772
00:37:37,391 --> 00:37:39,174
Made it through the day.

773
00:37:39,176 --> 00:37:41,109
Have we eliminated
the threat yet?

774
00:37:41,111 --> 00:37:45,647
Kovach and Alvarez
are neutralized.

775
00:37:45,649 --> 00:37:47,533
But this is a tricky case.

776
00:37:47,535 --> 00:37:50,819
To be perfectly honest,
I'm just...

777
00:37:50,821 --> 00:37:51,954
Not sure.

778
00:37:51,956 --> 00:37:53,822
Finch, Carter lives uptown.

779
00:37:53,824 --> 00:37:55,991
So why is she headed downtown?

780
00:37:55,993 --> 00:37:57,376
Wait a minute.

781
00:37:57,378 --> 00:37:59,628
Where'd she go?

782
00:38:01,781 --> 00:38:03,582
I lost her.

783
00:38:03,584 --> 00:38:06,802
Track her phone for me.

784
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:12,140
Where you been?

785
00:38:12,142 --> 00:38:13,675
You said you was gonna
buy me dinner.

786
00:38:13,677 --> 00:38:15,344
Where you been?
I been waiting.

787
00:38:15,346 --> 00:38:17,545
I'm sorry, BC.
I got to fill out a requisition

788
00:38:17,547 --> 00:38:20,465
for the big payout.

789
00:38:20,467 --> 00:38:23,151
But look, why don't you take
whatever I got?

790
00:38:23,153 --> 00:38:24,736
No, that's all right.
You ain't got to do all that.

791
00:38:24,738 --> 00:38:26,738
Let's just call this
a down payment, okay?

792
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:29,691
I want you to have that.

793
00:38:29,693 --> 00:38:31,243
I'm sorry, Carter.

794
00:38:31,245 --> 00:38:32,911
You always been good to me,

795
00:38:32,913 --> 00:38:36,698
but I ain't got no choice.

796
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:41,286
You told me to find
that guy Elias.

797
00:38:41,288 --> 00:38:42,871
Well, I found him.

798
00:38:45,675 --> 00:38:48,343
Sorry.

799
00:38:48,345 --> 00:38:50,912
He said it's either
gonna be you or me.

800
00:38:50,914 --> 00:38:53,682
And it ain't gonna be me.

801
00:39:10,149 --> 00:39:11,867
Look alive, Carter.

802
00:39:13,736 --> 00:39:15,370
About all that's left
of that storage facility

803
00:39:15,372 --> 00:39:16,738
your friend took us to.

804
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:18,957
You found the explosives.

805
00:39:18,959 --> 00:39:20,442
Found and detonated.

806
00:39:20,444 --> 00:39:23,879
I, uh, couldn't have done
what you did,

807
00:39:23,881 --> 00:39:27,716
getting information
from that raghead.

808
00:39:27,718 --> 00:39:30,952
Where's Yusuf?

809
00:39:30,954 --> 00:39:35,340
Yeah, he, uh...
Didn't make it back.

810
00:39:35,342 --> 00:39:39,127
Accidents happen.

811
00:39:39,129 --> 00:39:42,130
He trusted me.

812
00:39:42,132 --> 00:39:46,184
I gave him my word.
I-I promised I'd protect him.

813
00:39:46,186 --> 00:39:49,154
You shouldn't make promises
you can't keep.

814
00:39:49,156 --> 00:39:51,523
Come on, you don't think
this guy was innocent, do you?

815
00:39:51,525 --> 00:39:54,142
He had a family.

816
00:39:54,144 --> 00:39:56,478
Don't you care
what happens to them?

817
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:59,031
It's not my job to care.

818
00:39:59,033 --> 00:40:01,667
What is wrong with you?

819
00:40:01,669 --> 00:40:03,869
You can't just play God!

820
00:40:03,871 --> 00:40:07,122
You don't get to decide
who lives and who dies!

821
00:40:07,124 --> 00:40:11,093
You want to stand
on your high horse, go ahead.

822
00:40:11,095 --> 00:40:13,762
But don't expect me and my men
to back you up.

823
00:40:13,764 --> 00:40:15,547
It's a long war.

824
00:40:15,549 --> 00:40:18,433
And you're all alone.

825
00:40:26,726 --> 00:40:28,110
Glad you took my advice

826
00:40:28,112 --> 00:40:30,979
about wearing that vest,
detective.

827
00:40:30,981 --> 00:40:33,014
I know this
doesn't change anything.

828
00:40:33,016 --> 00:40:35,367
I know you'll still arrest me
if you get the chance.

829
00:40:35,369 --> 00:40:37,685
But you should know,

830
00:40:37,687 --> 00:40:40,355
whether you like me
or not, Joss,

831
00:40:40,357 --> 00:40:43,458
you're not alone.

832
00:40:54,637 --> 00:40:57,305
Elias got to Carter's CI.

833
00:40:57,307 --> 00:40:58,390
Turned him into his triggerman.

834
00:40:58,392 --> 00:41:00,726
- Is she safe?
- For now.

835
00:41:00,728 --> 00:41:03,979
Time to end this, Finch,
once and for all.

836
00:41:07,316 --> 00:41:10,068
Aah!

837
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:12,404
Body falls from this height,
it's messy.

838
00:41:12,406 --> 00:41:15,723
Of course, I don't care
about making it look clean...

839
00:41:15,725 --> 00:41:16,992
Unlike your pal Elias.

840
00:41:16,994 --> 00:41:18,744
I don't know who you are,

841
00:41:18,746 --> 00:41:21,229
but you're threatening
a captain.

842
00:41:21,231 --> 00:41:23,231
Okay, okay, okay.

843
00:41:23,233 --> 00:41:26,568
Elias can't kill a cop
without permission.

844
00:41:26,570 --> 00:41:29,171
Run this up
the chain of command.

845
00:41:29,173 --> 00:41:30,905
Permission's been revoked.

846
00:41:30,907 --> 00:41:35,743
Tell Elias if he so much as
touches Detective Carter again,

847
00:41:35,745 --> 00:41:39,431
I will put him, you...

848
00:41:39,433 --> 00:41:41,850
Everyone in the ground.

849
00:41:41,852 --> 00:41:44,386
- You got that?
- Yeah.

850
00:41:44,388 --> 00:41:48,590
Oh. Oh.

851
00:41:58,868 --> 00:42:02,704
Grandma said you were late
for curfew again.

852
00:42:02,706 --> 00:42:05,657
Oh, come on, ma.
You're serious?

853
00:42:05,659 --> 00:42:07,159
I was at a dance.

854
00:42:07,161 --> 00:42:10,212
Is she pretty?

855
00:42:12,048 --> 00:42:14,382
Better be smart too.

856
00:42:14,384 --> 00:42:16,718
Smart and pretty.

857
00:42:22,725 --> 00:42:24,092
You all right, mom?

858
00:42:24,094 --> 00:42:27,145
Did you pull your back
or something?

859
00:42:27,147 --> 00:42:30,265
It's nothing that won't heal.

860
00:42:34,187 --> 00:42:37,105
Sorry I missed it, t.

861
00:42:37,107 --> 00:42:40,859
You work too hard.
You should quit.

862
00:42:40,861 --> 00:42:43,495
Wouldn't know
how to if I tried.

863
00:42:43,497 --> 00:42:46,998
I don't like it--
You out there every day.

864
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,583
Who's got your back?

865
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:53,655
You don't have to worry
about me.

866
00:42:53,657 --> 00:42:56,675
I can take care of myself.

867
00:42:56,677 --> 00:42:58,993
Besides...

868
00:42:58,995 --> 00:43:01,847
We got each other.

869
00:43:01,849 --> 00:43:04,099
Who else do we need?

870
00:43:25,765 --> 00:43:27,100
