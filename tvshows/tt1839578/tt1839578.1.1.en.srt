1
00:00:06,732 --> 00:00:09,885
When you find that one person
who connects you to the world,

2
00:00:10,858 --> 00:00:12,851
you become someone different.

3
00:00:14,362 --> 00:00:16,010
Someone better.

4
00:00:19,243 --> 00:00:21,362
When that person is taken from you...

5
00:00:24,793 --> 00:00:26,499
What do you become then?

6
00:00:33,574 --> 00:00:35,118
Whatever he wanna do, you know?

7
00:00:37,511 --> 00:00:38,512
What?

8
00:00:39,969 --> 00:00:41,625
Where'd you get that,
in a cereal box?

9
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:43,086
You wanna see a real gun?

10
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:46,255
Forget you.

11
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:48,424
Every little punk
is carrying now, Anton.

12
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,674
That's why your father wanted us
to take the car home.

13
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:51,805
Relax.

14
00:00:52,869 --> 00:00:55,264
We're picking up new hardware next week.
Restore a little order.

15
00:00:57,516 --> 00:01:00,660
Besides, when we take the car,
we don't get to meet new friends.

16
00:01:00,986 --> 00:01:02,229
Look at this guy.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

18
00:01:16,178 --> 00:01:17,980
You didn't bring enough
for the whole group.

19
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:21,164
I have to teach you about sharing.

20
00:02:00,717 --> 00:02:02,557
I'll need a statement from the bum.

21
00:02:02,998 --> 00:02:04,503
What hospital did they take him to?

22
00:02:04,628 --> 00:02:06,890
He declined treatment.
We got video on it, though.

23
00:02:25,918 --> 00:02:26,919
You know,

24
00:02:27,863 --> 00:02:31,324
you could have done me a favor and let
those guys land a couple more punches.

25
00:02:32,145 --> 00:02:33,495
Question for you.

26
00:02:34,436 --> 00:02:35,614
Looking at that tape,

27
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,203
I'd say you spent some time
in the service.

28
00:02:39,277 --> 00:02:41,022
But you don't learn
how to fight like that

29
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:42,517
in the regular army.

30
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:44,957
So what were you, special forces?

31
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:46,124
Delta?

32
00:02:49,732 --> 00:02:52,311
I'm Carter.
You didn't give us a name.

33
00:02:54,773 --> 00:02:55,635
It's funny.

34
00:02:56,393 --> 00:02:59,786
Seems like the only time you need
a name now is when you're in trouble.

35
00:03:01,292 --> 00:03:02,653
So am I in trouble?

36
00:03:03,681 --> 00:03:05,320
I don't know, you tell me.

37
00:03:05,943 --> 00:03:07,480
You're the one living on the street.

38
00:03:12,863 --> 00:03:15,488
Making that transition back
can be tough.

39
00:03:15,882 --> 00:03:18,336
Some guys I knew got a little lost,

40
00:03:18,749 --> 00:03:20,909
needed a little help adjusting.

41
00:03:21,892 --> 00:03:23,234
You need some help?

42
00:03:29,622 --> 00:03:30,503
Of course,

43
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:32,213
some other guys I knew,

44
00:03:33,437 --> 00:03:35,588
they'd done so many evil things,

45
00:03:35,713 --> 00:03:38,099
they felt like they needed
the punishment.

46
00:03:41,508 --> 00:03:42,973
That sound more like your story?

47
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:48,574
Excuse me for a second.

48
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:06,947
I'm here for my client.

49
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:14,880
Your guy's prints were found in half
a dozen crime scenes over the years.

50
00:04:15,234 --> 00:04:17,466
Open warrants
in four different countries.

51
00:04:18,664 --> 00:04:20,052
Who you got down there, Carter,

52
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:21,568
the angel of death?

53
00:04:23,692 --> 00:04:26,030
I appreciate the help, counselor.

54
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:28,005
But who's picking up...

55
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:29,371
The tab?

56
00:04:32,876 --> 00:04:34,802
Our employer
wants to have a word with you.

57
00:05:16,228 --> 00:05:17,973
Do I owe you money?

58
00:05:18,337 --> 00:05:19,458
Because I'm...

59
00:05:20,254 --> 00:05:22,128
Running a little short at the moment.

60
00:05:22,588 --> 00:05:24,754
You don't owe me anything, Mr. Reese.

61
00:05:26,316 --> 00:05:28,194
That's the name you prefer, isn't it?

62
00:05:28,587 --> 00:05:30,226
I know you've had several.

63
00:05:32,229 --> 00:05:34,799
Don't worry,
I'm not gonna tell anybody about you.

64
00:05:36,812 --> 00:05:38,834
You don't know anything about me.

65
00:05:39,859 --> 00:05:42,476
I know exactly everything about you,
Mr. Reese.

66
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:46,262
I know about the work you used to do
for the government.

67
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:49,736
I know about the doubts you came to have
about that work.

68
00:05:50,244 --> 00:05:53,282
I know that the government, along
with everybody else, thinks you're dead.

69
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:59,139
I know you've spent the last two months
trying to drink yourself to death.

70
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:03,823
I know you're contemplating
more efficient ways to do it.

71
00:06:05,516 --> 00:06:07,577
So you see,
knowledge is not my problem.

72
00:06:09,016 --> 00:06:10,847
Doing something
with that knowledge...

73
00:06:12,591 --> 00:06:14,108
That's where you'd come in.

74
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:18,897
And you can call me Mr. Finch.

75
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:24,028
I think you and I
can help one another.

76
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:29,640
I don't think you need a psychiatrist
or a support group, or pills...

77
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:32,267
What do I need?

78
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:34,087
You need a purpose.

79
00:06:36,384 --> 00:06:38,464
More specifically, you need a job.

80
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:46,847
Eight million people.

81
00:06:48,582 --> 00:06:50,536
You know
what they all have in common?

82
00:06:50,661 --> 00:06:52,856
None of them knows what happens next.

83
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:57,558
Someone is murdered
in New York City every 18 hours.

84
00:06:58,794 --> 00:07:01,463
At the end of the day,
one of these people will be gone.

85
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:04,264
Bad things happen to people
every day.

86
00:07:05,117 --> 00:07:06,497
You can't stop that.

87
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:08,060
What if you could?

88
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:11,057
Not the things that happen
in the heat of the moment.

89
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:13,836
But so many crimes are planned

90
00:07:14,135 --> 00:07:16,157
days, weeks in advance.

91
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:19,205
What if you could stop those?

92
00:07:20,856 --> 00:07:22,082
I've got a list.

93
00:07:23,204 --> 00:07:27,009
A list of people who are about
to be involved in very bad situations.

94
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,327
Murders,

95
00:07:28,452 --> 00:07:29,408
kidnappings.

96
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,641
The people that are on my list,

97
00:07:32,274 --> 00:07:34,478
they have no idea that anything's
about to happen to them.

98
00:07:34,603 --> 00:07:36,012
Most of them are just...

99
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,582
ordinary people

100
00:07:39,206 --> 00:07:40,653
- like her.
- Thank you.

101
00:07:41,525 --> 00:07:43,289
Her name is Diane Hansen,

102
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,171
and this week
she's at the top of my list.

103
00:07:47,014 --> 00:07:50,196
I don't know exactly what's going
to happen or what her role in it is.

104
00:07:51,576 --> 00:07:54,183
She might be the victim.
She could be the perpetrator.

105
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:56,371
All I know is that she's involved.

106
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:59,547
I want you to follow her,
figure out what's gonna to happen,

107
00:08:00,256 --> 00:08:01,773
and stop it from happening.

108
00:08:04,163 --> 00:08:05,447
So what do you think?

109
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:11,866
I think you're a bored rich guy.

110
00:08:12,394 --> 00:08:14,179
I think that woman's probably
your ex-wife

111
00:08:14,304 --> 00:08:16,230
or someone you rode
in an elevator with once.

112
00:08:16,355 --> 00:08:18,081
And either way, I think I'm done.

113
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:40,732
<i>Tonight police are looking for
a homeless man for further questioning.</i>

114
00:08:40,857 --> 00:08:42,898
<i>The unidentified man
was originally believed</i>

115
00:08:43,213 --> 00:08:46,020
<i>to be the victim of a violent assault
on the subway.</i>

116
00:08:46,145 --> 00:08:48,950
<i>But now police consider the man
a person of interest</i>

117
00:08:49,075 --> 00:08:51,410
<i>in a number of crimes nationwide.</i>

118
00:09:09,381 --> 00:09:10,384
What's wrong?

119
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,548
Jess, what's wrong?

120
00:09:30,409 --> 00:09:33,894
<i>You need to understand, Mr. Reese,
the information I have is incomplete,</i>

121
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:35,298
<i>but it's never wrong.</i>

122
00:09:35,423 --> 00:09:37,374
<i>You need to know
what it would be like</i>

123
00:09:37,499 --> 00:09:39,405
<i>to be forced to listen
to someone get murdered,</i>

124
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:41,696
<i>and not be able
to do anything about it.</i>

<i>1:37 A.M.</i>

128
00:10:16,917 --> 00:10:17,918
Too late.

129
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:21,097
This recording is three years old.

130
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,499
A woman murdered in this room
by her husband.

131
00:10:27,015 --> 00:10:28,232
For the insurance.

132
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:30,838
You were too late for her.

133
00:10:31,649 --> 00:10:33,592
Like you were too late
for your friend Jessica.

134
00:10:34,701 --> 00:10:37,364
You were halfway around the world
when she was killed.

135
00:10:39,638 --> 00:10:41,517
- What do you know about it?
- It's the truth.

136
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:44,478
You left the government
because they lied to you. I never will.

137
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,039
All you ever wanted to do
was protect people.

138
00:10:59,783 --> 00:11:01,431
It's a wire-tap recording.

139
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:05,256
NSA or FISA.
Government.

140
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:11,965
- But you're not government.
- No, I'm not.

141
00:11:19,969 --> 00:11:21,732
I guess you could call me...

142
00:11:22,558 --> 00:11:24,476
a concerned third party.

143
00:11:26,054 --> 00:11:27,984
You couldn't have saved this woman...

144
00:11:28,645 --> 00:11:29,710
Or your friend.

145
00:11:30,595 --> 00:11:33,270
But you could have
if you had have known in time.

146
00:11:33,395 --> 00:11:37,280
That's the other thing I'm offering you,
a chance to be there in time.

147
00:11:42,817 --> 00:11:44,465
It's not too late for her.

148
00:11:44,801 --> 00:11:46,957
You could help me stop
what's about to happen.

149
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:49,167
The question is, will you?

150
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:59,461
<i>Behind the Government Team</i> presents

00:11:59,586 --> 00:12:00,587
www.u-sub.net

152
00:12:09,498 --> 00:12:13,382
- What is this place?
- The decline of Western civilization.

153
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:16,518
The city closed half its libraries.

154
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:17,987
Budget cuts.

155
00:12:19,421 --> 00:12:22,645
This building was sold to a bank
that I control,

156
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:25,329
which promptly declared bankruptcy.

157
00:12:25,656 --> 00:12:28,081
So the property
is in a kind of limbo.

158
00:12:28,485 --> 00:12:29,928
It doesn't exist.

159
00:12:30,264 --> 00:12:31,529
Neither do you.

160
00:12:31,922 --> 00:12:33,504
I did a little digging.

161
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:36,800
I recognize, Mr. Reese,
that there's a disparity

00:12:36,925 --> 00:12:40,432
between how much I know about you
and how much you know about me.

163
00:12:40,876 --> 00:12:44,250
I know you'll be trying to close
that gap as quickly as possible.

164
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:45,805
But I should tell you

165
00:12:46,485 --> 00:12:48,287
I'm a really private person.

166
00:12:50,721 --> 00:12:52,397
Drivers licenses...

167
00:12:53,213 --> 00:12:54,444
Credit cards.

168
00:12:54,569 --> 00:12:56,383
Six cover identities.

169
00:12:57,336 --> 00:13:00,196
Funds to be replenished
through a proxy corporation.

170
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:02,746
Just like
when you were with the agency.

171
00:13:04,715 --> 00:13:06,077
When I was with the agency...

172
00:13:07,315 --> 00:13:09,112
I knew who was picking up the tab.

173
00:13:09,996 --> 00:13:11,290
This is your list?

174
00:13:12,204 --> 00:13:13,084
The list?

175
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,210
Yeah.

176
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,129
But you don't get names?

177
00:13:19,515 --> 00:13:21,401
These are social security numbers.

178
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:24,512
And each of them map out
to a violent crime.

179
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:27,974
And all of these numbers represent...

180
00:13:28,365 --> 00:13:29,615
Lost chances.

181
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:33,882
I could be a lot more help to you if
you tell me where you got these numbers.

182
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,445
It doesn't really matter.

183
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:37,942
You need to know
that the next number that's up, is hers.

184
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:47,316
Diane Hansen.

185
00:13:48,723 --> 00:13:50,190
Grew up in Detroit.

186
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:53,500
Moved to the city after Law School.

187
00:13:53,969 --> 00:13:54,970
Single.

188
00:13:55,095 --> 00:13:56,596
She have any enemies?

189
00:13:56,721 --> 00:13:59,787
One or two.
She's an assistant district attorney.

190
00:13:59,912 --> 00:14:02,050
Best conviction record
in her department.

191
00:14:02,324 --> 00:14:05,007
We have no idea
when this bad thing might happen?

192
00:14:05,132 --> 00:14:07,314
Could be in a week.
Could be five minutes.

193
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,460
That's why we need to learn
as much as we can about her.

194
00:14:10,709 --> 00:14:12,234
How do you intend to begin?

195
00:14:12,672 --> 00:14:15,522
The slow way.
Cultivate a relationship...

196
00:14:16,464 --> 00:14:18,867
to allow you to earn
the asset's trust.

197
00:14:18,992 --> 00:14:20,301
And the fast way?

198
00:14:23,895 --> 00:14:26,930
<i>First, you break into their home
and go through all their stuff.</i>

199
00:14:30,994 --> 00:14:32,455
<i>Email, financial records,</i>

200
00:14:33,078 --> 00:14:34,416
<i>personal effects.</i>

201
00:14:38,585 --> 00:14:40,655
<i>Then you hack into their cell phone.</i>

202
00:14:42,645 --> 00:14:44,932
<i>As long as it's charged
and has signal,</i>

203
00:14:45,057 --> 00:14:46,303
<i>you can use the GPS</i>

204
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:47,595
<i>to track them.</i>

205
00:14:51,335 --> 00:14:53,893
<i>You can use the microphone
to listen into their conversations</i>

206
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,896
<i>whether they're talking
on the phone or not.</i>

207
00:14:56,161 --> 00:14:58,705
<i>Hi mom.
I'm sorry I haven't called you back...</i>

208
00:14:58,830 --> 00:14:59,899
<i>Third step...</i>

209
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,171
<i>You need picture.</i>

210
00:15:01,296 --> 00:15:04,680
<i>A wireless camera, and you can
keep an eye on them from anywhere.</i>

211
00:15:04,805 --> 00:15:06,990
<i>I know you're worried.
I know, I'm fine.</i>

212
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:10,492
<i>It is a tough job,
but I can look after myself.</i>

213
00:15:10,617 --> 00:15:11,640
<i>You know that.</i>

214
00:15:12,349 --> 00:15:15,566
<i>She's tough,
but she's scared about something.</i>

215
00:15:16,717 --> 00:15:17,862
Given Hansen's job,

216
00:15:17,987 --> 00:15:20,593
we've got hundreds of people
who could be holding a grudge.

217
00:15:21,686 --> 00:15:22,839
I cut the list to two.

218
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:25,884
The first is Wheeler,
her co-counselor.

219
00:15:26,229 --> 00:15:28,302
<i>They dated for a few months
last year.</i>

220
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:30,430
<i>She broke things off.</i>

221
00:15:30,784 --> 00:15:31,890
<i>You got time to talk?</i>

222
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:34,630
- <i>Maybe I can buy you dinner.</i>
- <i>I'm busy, another time?</i>

223
00:15:34,755 --> 00:15:36,839
<i>Is something wrong?
I've been noticing lately...</i>

224
00:15:36,964 --> 00:15:38,563
<i>No, I'm fine, thank you.</i>

225
00:15:39,034 --> 00:15:42,410
<i>And forty percent of murders involve
some kind of romantic relationship.</i>

226
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:45,404
<i>Wheeler's divorced.
One kid.</i>

227
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,364
Partial custody, alimony.

228
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:48,489
Career stalled.

229
00:15:49,429 --> 00:15:52,040
The second person I'm looking into
is Lawrence Pope.

230
00:15:52,165 --> 00:15:54,462
The man Hansen
is currently prosecuting.

231
00:15:54,587 --> 00:15:57,727
<i>Pope's on trial for killing his friends
in a drug deal gone bad.</i>

232
00:15:57,852 --> 00:15:59,500
<i>Stole half a million in cash.</i>

233
00:16:00,183 --> 00:16:03,059
<i>Pope's gang may be targeting her
for reprisal.</i>

234
00:16:03,184 --> 00:16:05,476
When we got there,
the scene was colorful.

235
00:16:06,281 --> 00:16:07,282
Five dead.

236
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:10,803
One of them had managed to crawl
ten feet to a phone to dial 911.

237
00:16:10,969 --> 00:16:12,068
Detective Fusco,

238
00:16:12,193 --> 00:16:15,242
when you interviewed Mr. Pope,
what did he tell you in his defense?

239
00:16:15,367 --> 00:16:17,477
He said that if he'd have shot
the poor bastard,

240
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,573
he would have shot him in the head,

241
00:16:19,698 --> 00:16:21,314
"same as I always do".

242
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:25,485
He wouldn't have left him there half-
dead, blubbering for his girlfriend.

243
00:16:30,425 --> 00:16:32,041
No more questions, your honor.

244
00:16:36,075 --> 00:16:37,175
<i>Detective...</i>

245
00:16:38,033 --> 00:16:40,083
<i>You went a little off script
in your testimony.</i>

246
00:16:40,595 --> 00:16:42,483
<i>You never told me
about that conversation,</i>

247
00:16:42,608 --> 00:16:44,003
<i>and it could clear Pope's name.</i>

248
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,923
<i>What's it matter?
We got the guy.</i>

249
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:48,967
<i>It matters because it's my job</i>

250
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,479
<i>to make absolutely sure
that the wrong people don't go to jail.</i>

251
00:16:51,604 --> 00:16:52,706
<i>Do you remember?</i>

252
00:16:53,011 --> 00:16:55,181
<i>Excuse me,
I thought we were on the same team.</i>

253
00:16:57,947 --> 00:16:59,977
Something's gone wrong with her case.

254
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,943
Hansen's on the move.
She's phoning county lockup,

255
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:09,004
<i>arranging a meeting with Pope...</i>

256
00:17:09,544 --> 00:17:10,545
alone.

257
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:13,574
Isn't my lawyer supposed
to be here for this?

258
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,268
I can call him if you want,

259
00:17:15,393 --> 00:17:18,121
but the reason I'm here is I don't think
you murdered those people.

260
00:17:19,021 --> 00:17:22,500
I think somebody else was in the house
when that 911 call was made.

261
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:25,211
Somebody who told you what was said,
which means you weren't there.

262
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,214
Is it somebody
you're trying to protect?

263
00:17:29,068 --> 00:17:30,982
<i>You gonna help me?
Is that it?</i>

264
00:17:31,107 --> 00:17:34,053
<i>The person who knows what happened that
night must be somebody you care about.</i>

265
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:36,155
Is it your younger brother Michael?

266
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:38,391
Pope's got a brother.
It's in his case file.

267
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:40,351
Got it.

268
00:17:40,806 --> 00:17:43,521
- Did he see the real killers?
- You should leave this alone, lady.

269
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,816
I can do the time.
These people are evil.

270
00:17:47,363 --> 00:17:49,819
<i>Killing when they want,
and they're protected from on high.</i>

271
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:52,822
You keep asking questions, they'll kill
me and my brother, and probably you too.

272
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:55,364
Whoever these people are,
you can trust me.

273
00:17:55,489 --> 00:17:57,401
We'll take care of you
and your brother.

274
00:18:00,796 --> 00:18:03,625
If the killers are out there, I'm gonna
find them, whether you help me or not.

275
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,335
It's my job.
Now, why don't you...

276
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:06,628
Bitch.

277
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:09,506
<i>You keep your damn mouth shut,
or I'll shut it for you!</i>

278
00:18:15,753 --> 00:18:16,596
I'm fine.

279
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,264
Okay.
She's okay.

280
00:18:19,499 --> 00:18:22,560
You were right about Hansen. Whoever
framed Pope will be coming after her.

281
00:18:23,059 --> 00:18:25,508
And only Pope's brother Michael
knows who they are.

282
00:18:35,299 --> 00:18:37,172
<i>Hi mom.
It's Jessica.</i>

283
00:18:37,297 --> 00:18:39,661
I'm just down in Mexico with Cindy,

284
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:42,121
and I'll be back tomorrow, okay?

285
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:43,288
Talk soon.

286
00:18:45,495 --> 00:18:47,252
I look like a Cindy?

287
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:50,255
I didn't tell her about us yet.

288
00:18:51,478 --> 00:18:52,943
It's been six months.

289
00:18:54,604 --> 00:18:57,060
I wish this week-end
could go on forever.

290
00:19:00,196 --> 00:19:01,301
It already has.

291
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:03,708
It's Tuesday.

292
00:19:04,697 --> 00:19:06,786
Which means that you
have to go back to the base,

293
00:19:06,911 --> 00:19:10,025
and I'm not gonna see you again
for two weeks, which I hate.

294
00:19:10,191 --> 00:19:11,600
Then ask me to stay,

295
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:13,547
and I will.

296
00:19:13,983 --> 00:19:14,984
I'll quit.

297
00:19:16,688 --> 00:19:17,689
I'll quit.

298
00:19:18,042 --> 00:19:19,992
Okay.
Then quit.

299
00:19:21,609 --> 00:19:22,621
I already did.

300
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:24,711
What?

301
00:19:27,885 --> 00:19:29,897
I didn't want to take the chance

302
00:19:30,899 --> 00:19:33,226
that you wouldn't be here
when I got back.

303
00:19:37,863 --> 00:19:40,680
But first, we need some more Tequila.

304
00:19:51,981 --> 00:19:53,732
Sweetheart, what's wrong?

305
00:19:54,665 --> 00:19:55,815
What's wrong?

306
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,154
It's New York.
I don't know.

307
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:01,010
Something's happened this morning.

308
00:20:02,975 --> 00:20:06,676
- Is it a plane crash?
- I think it's two planes.

309
00:20:17,822 --> 00:20:18,843
<i>Thanks.</i>

310
00:20:20,914 --> 00:20:22,358
<i>You went to see Pope last night?</i>

311
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:26,138
<i>I gave him one more chance to
turn in his accomplice, cut a deal.</i>

312
00:20:26,263 --> 00:20:27,394
<i>He give you anything?</i>

313
00:20:27,785 --> 00:20:28,937
<i>No. As usual.</i>

314
00:20:30,645 --> 00:20:31,746
<i>I'm late.</i>

315
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,652
She's trying to track down
Pope's brother Michael.

316
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:38,947
He can ID the real killers.

317
00:20:39,113 --> 00:20:40,613
She's stonewalling Wheeler.

318
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:43,076
Does she think he's involved?

319
00:20:44,043 --> 00:20:46,329
Remember, Pope said they were
protected from on high.

320
00:20:51,344 --> 00:20:52,418
Wait a second.

321
00:20:55,084 --> 00:20:57,507
Turns out there's a good reason
she doesn't trust Wheeler.

322
00:20:58,419 --> 00:21:02,266
He might be working with the killers.
And they're after Michael Pope.

323
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:07,016
We better get to this kid
before someone else does.

324
00:21:23,794 --> 00:21:25,457
Can I talk to you for a second?

325
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:44,982
- I've got a message from your brother.
- You don't know my brother.

326
00:21:45,107 --> 00:21:48,508
But I know what you saw.
I'm not the only one looking for you.

327
00:21:48,633 --> 00:21:49,933
You need to come with me.

328
00:21:53,621 --> 00:21:54,855
Help me.

329
00:21:55,255 --> 00:21:57,442
This man is trying to put me
in a taxi cab with him!

330
00:21:58,207 --> 00:22:00,236
He's trying to take pictures of me.

331
00:22:00,985 --> 00:22:02,071
What's going on?

332
00:22:02,598 --> 00:22:03,823
How you doing?

333
00:22:05,701 --> 00:22:07,707
Michael Pope's still on the subway.

334
00:22:07,832 --> 00:22:11,101
When he comes up for air, you can use
the GPS on your phone to find him.

335
00:22:11,226 --> 00:22:14,751
If Pope's right these guys, I'm gonna
need a hell of a lot than a phone.

336
00:22:16,047 --> 00:22:18,350
About that, I don't like
firearms very much.

337
00:22:18,475 --> 00:22:22,225
Neither do I, if someone has
to have them, I'd rather it was me.

338
00:22:22,757 --> 00:22:26,095
Besides, my friend from the subway
has a line on some.

339
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:27,411
Lightly used.

340
00:22:27,899 --> 00:22:29,306
Steep discount.

341
00:22:42,803 --> 00:22:45,657
- Pop, what about this one?
- Are you planning on buying that one?

342
00:22:46,378 --> 00:22:48,284
- I was showing it...
- Put it back on the table

343
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,729
before somebody else kicks your ass.

344
00:22:51,255 --> 00:22:53,061
Have you guys seen the men's room?

345
00:22:54,871 --> 00:22:55,872
Anton.

346
00:22:56,374 --> 00:22:57,671
Good to see you again.

347
00:22:57,796 --> 00:22:59,217
You know this guy?

348
00:23:00,943 --> 00:23:03,199
That's some pretty serious equipment.

349
00:23:03,324 --> 00:23:05,301
Have you guys taken a safety course?

350
00:23:07,104 --> 00:23:08,263
Take you, for instance.

351
00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:10,548
You're holding that thing sideways.

352
00:23:10,673 --> 00:23:13,852
You can't aim it, and two, it'll eject
a shell casing right into your face.

353
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:16,061
See?

354
00:23:34,171 --> 00:23:37,291
I'm gonna hold on to these while
you guys get some more practice.

355
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,520
Have a nice day.

356
00:23:42,046 --> 00:23:43,756
Who the hell was that?

357
00:23:47,338 --> 00:23:49,388
<i>I got a signal from your phone.</i>

358
00:23:51,387 --> 00:23:52,935
<i>Tell me you found Michael Pope.</i>

359
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:55,393
<i>He's the only one who knows
who's coming after Hansen.</i>

360
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,102
Somebody else found him first.

361
00:23:57,855 --> 00:23:58,856
Listen.

362
00:23:59,437 --> 00:24:00,438
Mikey.

363
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:02,316
You were gonna tell him all us.

364
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:03,538
Weren't you?

365
00:24:04,916 --> 00:24:05,778
Head uptown.

366
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:07,029
Are you hearing?

367
00:24:09,282 --> 00:24:10,950
97th and Riverside.

368
00:24:11,345 --> 00:24:12,395
Step on it.

369
00:24:13,753 --> 00:24:15,621
We're gonna put a couple in his head.

370
00:24:16,062 --> 00:24:17,832
Make it look like a gang thing.

371
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:20,627
You gotta do something.

372
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:22,670
<i>Relax.</i>

373
00:24:24,869 --> 00:24:26,049
I'm on it.

374
00:24:26,461 --> 00:24:27,748
Keep the change.

375
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:09,320
You're crazy.

376
00:25:09,691 --> 00:25:11,182
We're both dead now.

377
00:25:11,307 --> 00:25:12,840
Do you know who they are?

378
00:25:13,497 --> 00:25:14,305
I do now.

379
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,094
Cops.
Come on.

380
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:41,916
<i>What exactly have you gotten me into?</i>

381
00:25:42,304 --> 00:25:44,752
<i>I don't know.
That's the whole point.</i>

382
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:47,122
I hired you to help me
figure that out.

383
00:25:49,692 --> 00:25:50,693
Here.

384
00:25:51,774 --> 00:25:53,719
I think we're up against
a group of corrupt cops.

385
00:25:54,239 --> 00:25:55,739
Stills is narcotics.

386
00:25:56,483 --> 00:25:59,466
Him and his men get word of deals.
They steal the drugs, the cash,

387
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:01,102
and they kill all the witnesses.

388
00:26:01,754 --> 00:26:04,670
And they get Fusco to frame up guys
like Lawrence Pope for the murders.

389
00:26:04,795 --> 00:26:05,982
Exactly.

390
00:26:06,424 --> 00:26:08,109
I think their next target is Hansen.

391
00:26:08,721 --> 00:26:10,810
But I don't know for certain.

392
00:26:10,935 --> 00:26:12,428
I don't know anything for certain,

393
00:26:12,553 --> 00:26:14,922
because you won't tell me
where you're getting your information.

394
00:26:19,564 --> 00:26:21,364
When the towers came down,

395
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:23,666
you were in a hotel in Mexico.

396
00:26:24,844 --> 00:26:25,894
I was here.

397
00:26:27,579 --> 00:26:28,779
I was working.

398
00:26:29,074 --> 00:26:31,257
Didn't even know about
the attacks until that evening.

399
00:26:31,976 --> 00:26:34,567
You see, Mr. Reese, until that day,

400
00:26:34,692 --> 00:26:37,638
I had spent the better part of my life
making myself very rich.

401
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:41,326
Suddenly all that money
didn't seem to amount to much.

402
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:47,183
After the attacks, the government gave
itself the power to read every email,

403
00:26:47,308 --> 00:26:49,158
listen to every cell phone,

404
00:26:49,964 --> 00:26:52,350
but they needed something
that could sort through it all,

405
00:26:53,105 --> 00:26:57,491
something that could pick the terrorists
out of the population before they act.

406
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,918
The public wanted to be protected.

407
00:27:00,712 --> 00:27:03,080
They didn't want to know
how they were being protected.

408
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:05,499
So when they finally
got a system that worked,

409
00:27:06,595 --> 00:27:08,044
they kept it secret.

410
00:27:09,005 --> 00:27:10,421
So how do you know about it?

411
00:27:12,248 --> 00:27:13,298
I built it.

412
00:27:16,829 --> 00:27:20,563
But there was a problem
with this machine.

413
00:27:20,912 --> 00:27:23,978
I had built it
to prevent the next 9/11.

414
00:27:24,103 --> 00:27:28,149
But it was seeing
all sorts of crimes.

415
00:27:28,274 --> 00:27:30,556
So I had to teach the machine

416
00:27:30,681 --> 00:27:33,236
to divide the things it saw
into two lists:

417
00:27:33,728 --> 00:27:36,744
Relevant and irrelevant.

418
00:27:37,233 --> 00:27:40,492
Events that would cause massive
loss of life were relevant,

419
00:27:40,658 --> 00:27:44,403
<i>so those would be passed along
to the NSA or the FBI.</i>

420
00:27:44,733 --> 00:27:46,521
<i>And the irrelevant information?</i>

421
00:27:49,181 --> 00:27:52,796
Every night at midnight,
the machine erases it.

422
00:27:54,189 --> 00:27:57,593
It was only later
that I realized my mistake.

423
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:59,309
That irrelevant list,

424
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,175
was eating away at me.

425
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:04,835
So where's the machine now?

426
00:28:05,836 --> 00:28:07,562
What, the drives?
Who knows?

427
00:28:07,728 --> 00:28:09,829
Government facility somewhere.

428
00:28:10,415 --> 00:28:11,816
But the machine?

429
00:28:13,688 --> 00:28:15,648
The machine is everywhere.

430
00:28:17,752 --> 00:28:19,698
Watching us with 10,000 eyes.

431
00:28:21,452 --> 00:28:23,484
<i>Listening with a million ears.</i>

432
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:28,297
- <i>What did I tell you about sending email?</i>
- <i>Three weeks, you could practically move in.</i>

433
00:28:28,422 --> 00:28:31,021
<i>Never put anything in an email
you cannot own.</i>

434
00:28:31,752 --> 00:28:33,504
You gave a way
to communicate with it?

435
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:36,767
I was building the government
a tool of unimaginable power.

436
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:40,258
I thought maybe an off switch
would come in handy.

437
00:28:41,447 --> 00:28:43,736
So I built myself
a back door into it.

438
00:28:43,861 --> 00:28:45,808
To access the irrelevant list.

439
00:28:46,547 --> 00:28:48,364
Just a social security number.

440
00:28:49,732 --> 00:28:52,063
If anyone ever found out,
I'd lose access so...

441
00:28:52,188 --> 00:28:54,108
Nine digits, that's all we get.

442
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:57,028
And we have no idea
why it picked Diane Hansen.

443
00:28:57,194 --> 00:29:01,031
It wouldn't be steering us toward her
if it wasn't seeing something.

444
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:03,120
But I don't know
if I can protect Hansen.

445
00:29:03,662 --> 00:29:05,202
I can't see the whole picture.

446
00:29:09,154 --> 00:29:10,967
I offered you a job, Mr. Reese.

447
00:29:12,281 --> 00:29:13,900
I never said it would be easy.

448
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,081
Carter.

449
00:29:21,471 --> 00:29:23,087
You hear about your pal Anton?

450
00:29:24,055 --> 00:29:25,592
He tried to buy some guns.

451
00:29:25,717 --> 00:29:27,683
Wound up getting shot
with their own merchandise.

452
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:29,601
- Are they dead?
- Embarrassed enough.

453
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:32,063
They got taken out by one guy,
in a suit.

454
00:29:44,245 --> 00:29:46,136
<i>Reese?
I have bad news.</i>

455
00:29:47,041 --> 00:29:49,676
<i>Lawrence Pope was stabbed
to death last night in his cell.</i>

456
00:29:49,801 --> 00:29:52,041
- <i>What?</i>
- <i>They're trying to cover their tracks.</i>

457
00:29:54,491 --> 00:29:55,991
Hansen must be next.

458
00:30:00,015 --> 00:30:01,133
<i>You wanted to meet?</i>

459
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:04,169
<i>Remsen and Avenue D in Canarsie.
20 minutes.</i>

460
00:30:06,688 --> 00:30:09,183
Finch.
It's happening now.

461
00:30:19,461 --> 00:30:20,462
Hello?

462
00:30:27,539 --> 00:30:28,689
Are you here?

463
00:30:45,274 --> 00:30:47,723
Are you gonna keep me waiting?
We don't have time for this.

464
00:30:47,848 --> 00:30:50,682
What's your problem?
Pope is dead.

465
00:30:51,017 --> 00:30:53,209
The problem is Wheeler.

466
00:30:53,334 --> 00:30:54,645
You idiot, he knows.

467
00:30:55,189 --> 00:30:57,273
He knows about Pope and
even some of the others.

468
00:30:57,727 --> 00:31:00,428
I can take care of the files,
but you have to take care of Wheeler.

469
00:31:00,553 --> 00:31:01,819
Tonight.

470
00:31:07,192 --> 00:31:08,659
Look what I found.

471
00:31:10,788 --> 00:31:12,162
We got ourselves a groupie.

472
00:31:14,229 --> 00:31:15,596
Heavily armed, too.

473
00:31:19,483 --> 00:31:20,880
- You know this guy?
- No.

474
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:24,056
You're not law enforcement.

475
00:31:24,222 --> 00:31:27,469
Cartel finally grow some stones?
Send somebody to take care of us?

476
00:31:28,518 --> 00:31:29,471
Who are you?

477
00:31:30,462 --> 00:31:32,850
Concerned...
Third party?

478
00:31:36,602 --> 00:31:38,325
Take care of him.
And...

479
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:40,503
get rid of Wheeler tonight.
Make it look clean.

480
00:31:41,708 --> 00:31:42,527
Stills.

481
00:31:43,114 --> 00:31:45,389
You screw this up,
I won't let it get to me.

482
00:31:45,514 --> 00:31:47,322
I'll take care of you like for Pope.

483
00:31:48,135 --> 00:31:49,943
I can look after myself.
You know that.

484
00:32:15,687 --> 00:32:16,688
Nice spot.

485
00:32:17,497 --> 00:32:18,736
It's oyster bay.

486
00:32:19,963 --> 00:32:21,142
Glad you like it.

487
00:32:22,113 --> 00:32:23,984
You're gonna be here a long, time.

488
00:32:25,879 --> 00:32:26,979
I'm curious.

489
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:31,199
Was there a point where you
knew you'd become a bad guy?

490
00:32:33,083 --> 00:32:34,794
Woke up one morning,
realized I was paid

491
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:37,873
to guard a bunch of jerks from Wall Street
who were robbing everybody.

492
00:32:38,294 --> 00:32:40,751
They're stealing more than
my annual salary in a afternoon.

493
00:32:42,342 --> 00:32:43,632
So I said, "what the hell?"

494
00:32:46,101 --> 00:32:47,439
I don't believe you.

495
00:32:49,549 --> 00:32:51,136
See, I've been watching you, Lionel.

496
00:32:53,095 --> 00:32:54,806
Your heart's not really into it.

497
00:32:55,875 --> 00:32:59,561
Now, Stills, he does it for money.
I think you do it because you're loyal.

498
00:33:01,555 --> 00:33:02,940
What's the difference?

499
00:33:03,886 --> 00:33:05,859
It's why I'm gonna let you live.

500
00:33:14,628 --> 00:33:15,605
Yeah,

501
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:18,353
I'm considering sticking
around New York for a while.

502
00:33:18,817 --> 00:33:21,836
If I do,
I'm gonna need someone on the inside,

503
00:33:22,325 --> 00:33:24,125
and you might come in handy.

504
00:33:24,291 --> 00:33:25,712
So I'm working for you now?

505
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:26,907
That's right.

506
00:33:27,899 --> 00:33:29,466
But I've got two rules.

507
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:30,885
One,

508
00:33:31,051 --> 00:33:34,249
you so much as hurt anybody,
and I'll kill you.

509
00:33:34,719 --> 00:33:38,142
I don't particularly like
killing people, but I'm very good at it.

510
00:33:39,306 --> 00:33:40,337
And two...

511
00:33:41,491 --> 00:33:43,216
You have to be more careful.

512
00:33:43,341 --> 00:33:46,505
For instance, if you're gonna put
someone in the backseat of your car,

513
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:48,360
you have to search them properly.

514
00:34:28,101 --> 00:34:30,124
No, please.
What are you doing?

515
00:34:39,916 --> 00:34:41,653
You have your vest on, officer?

516
00:34:42,986 --> 00:34:43,874
Yeah.

517
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,815
- Where the hell have you...
- <i>There's no time. We were wrong.</i>

518
00:35:08,981 --> 00:35:11,403
Hansen isn't the target.
She's the ringleader.

519
00:35:11,528 --> 00:35:13,723
They're going after Wheeler.
Tonight.

520
00:35:32,571 --> 00:35:33,932
Wheeler's up there.

521
00:35:34,591 --> 00:35:37,469
He heads to the gym most nights.
I got Doyle upstairs staking him out.

522
00:35:37,892 --> 00:35:39,052
The place is a dump.

523
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:41,223
There's no doorman,
no cameras, nobody.

524
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:43,768
We'll take him in the lobby.
Soon as it's done,

525
00:35:43,893 --> 00:35:46,826
we take the shooter out.
Give him a block and then take him out.

526
00:35:46,951 --> 00:35:48,980
Head shots this time, you understand?

527
00:35:49,146 --> 00:35:50,919
Get our friend out of the trunk.

528
00:35:52,537 --> 00:35:55,369
- Who is this guy?
- Some ex-con Wheeler put away.

529
00:36:05,304 --> 00:36:06,672
Azarello, lights.

530
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,005
Doyle, talk to me.

531
00:36:14,171 --> 00:36:15,299
He's coming out now.

532
00:36:20,446 --> 00:36:22,329
- Come on, Henry, let's go.
- Wait.

533
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:25,017
Show me that basketball of yours.
Let's go.

534
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:27,811
- Damn, he's got his kid with him.
- What a waste.

535
00:36:28,336 --> 00:36:29,581
Henry, watch out.

536
00:36:37,668 --> 00:36:39,268
You're about to kill a man...

537
00:36:39,806 --> 00:36:41,205
And his son.

538
00:36:47,019 --> 00:36:49,082
Please.
Please don't do this.

539
00:36:50,828 --> 00:36:51,965
Drop your weapon.

540
00:37:12,288 --> 00:37:14,780
That isn't true actually.
If you keep working on it,

541
00:37:14,905 --> 00:37:17,627
if you keep throwing the ball like that,
you'll be able to throw that fast.

542
00:37:17,752 --> 00:37:19,112
- Really?
- Absolutely.

543
00:37:41,847 --> 00:37:42,873
Let him go.

544
00:37:43,716 --> 00:37:44,998
I can't do that.

545
00:37:45,742 --> 00:37:47,747
I let him go my friends
and I go to jail.

546
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:54,061
Drag your friend outside

547
00:37:54,947 --> 00:37:56,736
and take him to the hospital.

548
00:37:57,294 --> 00:37:58,459
Right now.

549
00:38:04,311 --> 00:38:05,993
I think I kill you
and your friend here.

550
00:38:06,666 --> 00:38:08,688
Make it look like
you killed each other.

551
00:38:09,139 --> 00:38:09,982
Then,

552
00:38:10,107 --> 00:38:12,196
just because you pissed me off...

553
00:38:13,001 --> 00:38:14,506
I'm gonna kill your family.

554
00:38:15,844 --> 00:38:17,045
And all your friends.

555
00:38:17,693 --> 00:38:19,284
I don't have any friends.

556
00:38:19,984 --> 00:38:21,925
I don't have any family left either.

557
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:25,262
Went around the world
looking for bad guys.

558
00:38:25,917 --> 00:38:28,640
But there were plenty of you
right here all along.

559
00:38:46,074 --> 00:38:47,443
So now, essentially,

560
00:38:47,568 --> 00:38:51,382
you're telling us you couldn't see what
was happening in the parking lot at all.

561
00:38:52,922 --> 00:38:54,164
I'm done, your honor.

562
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:55,831
Ms. Hansen?

563
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:59,706
The state isn't paying you by the hour,
counselor.

564
00:39:01,086 --> 00:39:03,633
Why don't we have the defendant
tell you in her own words?

565
00:39:04,105 --> 00:39:06,425
Let's listen
to the 911 call she made.

566
00:39:09,261 --> 00:39:12,017
<i>And hey, take care of Wheeler.
Tonight.</i>

567
00:39:12,295 --> 00:39:14,186
<i>Make it look clean.
And Stills?</i>

568
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:16,271
<i>You screw this up,
I won't let it get to me.</i>

569
00:39:16,599 --> 00:39:18,917
<i>I'll take care of you
just like I took care of Pope.</i>

570
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:21,773
<i>I can look after myself.
You know that.</i>

571
00:39:44,967 --> 00:39:47,000
You ready to get to work, officer?

572
00:39:49,216 --> 00:39:51,305
I'm no good to you.
I'm dead.

573
00:39:51,471 --> 00:39:53,818
Just a matter of time
before the gangs get me.

574
00:39:54,284 --> 00:39:55,310
Or I.A.

575
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:57,249
No one knows you're involved.

576
00:39:57,525 --> 00:39:58,771
I took care of that.

577
00:39:59,132 --> 00:40:01,817
Besides,
they'll be too busy looking for Stills.

578
00:40:02,218 --> 00:40:04,250
The police will think
he's run for it.

579
00:40:04,924 --> 00:40:07,686
The gangs and the mob will think
he's gone Witness Protection.

580
00:40:07,811 --> 00:40:09,491
Is that where he is,
Witness Protection?

581
00:40:09,786 --> 00:40:10,873
No, Lionel.

582
00:40:11,208 --> 00:40:12,502
He's in the trunk.

583
00:40:13,896 --> 00:40:15,285
Only problem is...

584
00:40:17,926 --> 00:40:19,667
I had to shoot him with your gun.

585
00:40:19,987 --> 00:40:22,853
And you'd have a hard time
explaining that one, so...

586
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:25,232
You'll be taking another trip.

587
00:40:25,903 --> 00:40:27,944
And I'm not coming along this time.

588
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:33,666
Where am I going?

589
00:40:33,791 --> 00:40:35,184
Oyster bay.

590
00:40:35,478 --> 00:40:39,420
Where no one's gonna find him
for a long, long time.

591
00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:41,481
I'll be in touch.

592
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:01,334
You have a decision to make.

593
00:41:01,978 --> 00:41:04,048
The machine gave you another number.

594
00:41:04,845 --> 00:41:06,810
The numbers never stop coming.

595
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:09,242
You should know that up front.

596
00:41:10,941 --> 00:41:11,970
Why me?

597
00:41:12,998 --> 00:41:15,902
I've been watching you
for a long time, John.

598
00:41:17,598 --> 00:41:19,769
We have more in common
than you might think.

599
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:22,846
The world thinks we're both dead,
for starters.

600
00:41:28,135 --> 00:41:31,126
You programmed the machine
to delete those irrelevant numbers.

601
00:41:31,978 --> 00:41:33,659
Now you're trying to save them.

602
00:41:34,873 --> 00:41:36,035
What changed your mind?

603
00:41:36,802 --> 00:41:39,122
Let's just say you're not the only one
that's lost someone.

604
00:41:42,534 --> 00:41:45,841
If you wanna leave, I'll give you
enough money to get as far as you need.

605
00:41:46,761 --> 00:41:47,762
Disappear.

606
00:41:50,068 --> 00:41:51,259
And if I stay?

607
00:41:52,828 --> 00:41:55,774
Sooner or later both of us
will probably wind up dead.

608
00:41:58,063 --> 00:41:59,972
Actually dead this time.

609
00:42:04,191 --> 00:42:05,840
I said I'd tell you the truth.

610
00:42:08,207 --> 00:42:09,702
Didn't say you'd like it.

611
00:42:18,076 --> 00:42:19,425
Start talking, officer.

612
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:21,324
You think I'm gonna rat
on my friends?

613
00:42:21,449 --> 00:42:24,151
Please. You can tell the D.A.
All about your crooked pals.

614
00:42:24,276 --> 00:42:26,787
I wanna know about him.
The guy who came after you.

615
00:42:26,912 --> 00:42:29,964
I don't know anything.
It was just some guy alone in a suit.

616
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:32,797
You're gonna tell me
everything that you don't know about him

617
00:42:32,922 --> 00:42:34,522
and where I can find him.

618
00:42:35,305 --> 00:43:35,277
