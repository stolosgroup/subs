1
00:00:01,583 --> 00:00:03,043
You are being watched.

2
00:00:04,107 --> 00:00:06,231
The government has
a secret system.

3
00:00:06,412 --> 00:00:10,069
A machine that spies on you
every hour of every day.

4
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:12,965
I know because I built it.

5
00:00:13,316 --> 00:00:15,582
I designed the machine to
detect acts of terror,

6
00:00:15,675 --> 00:00:17,190
but it sees everything.

7
00:00:17,329 --> 00:00:20,220
Violet crimes involving
ordinary people.

8
00:00:20,222 --> 00:00:21,638
People like you.

9
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:25,442
Crimes the government
considered irrelevant.

10
00:00:25,444 --> 00:00:28,996
They wouldn't act,
so I decided I would.

11
00:00:28,998 --> 00:00:30,797
But I needed a partner.

12
00:00:30,799 --> 00:00:33,367
Someone with the skills
to intervene.

13
00:00:33,369 --> 00:00:37,487
Hunted by the authorities,
we work in secret.

14
00:00:37,489 --> 00:00:39,373
You'll never find us.

15
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:42,898
But victim or perpetrator,
if your number's up,

16
00:00:43,081 --> 00:00:44,602
we'll find you.

18
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,674
Hey, it's me.

19
00:00:57,676 --> 00:01:00,444
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I got tied up here at work.

20
00:01:01,447 --> 00:01:03,147
I was thinking we could
grab a bite, okay?

21
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:04,281
Usual place.

22
00:01:04,283 --> 00:01:08,518
Okay, see you in 30.
Yeah, bye.

23
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,905
Hold it.

24
00:01:11,907 --> 00:01:14,374
Almost missed it.

25
00:01:18,213 --> 00:01:19,863
Those for your wife?

26
00:01:19,865 --> 00:01:23,383
Uh, yes.

27
00:01:23,385 --> 00:01:26,203
I thought your wife
liked roses.

28
00:01:26,205 --> 00:01:27,888
Excuse me.

29
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:29,139
Do I know you?

30
00:01:29,141 --> 00:01:30,424
No.

31
00:01:30,426 --> 00:01:32,559
But I know you, Bill.

32
00:01:32,561 --> 00:01:34,311
Little relationship advice,

33
00:01:34,313 --> 00:01:35,879
if you're gonna
step out on your wife,

34
00:01:35,881 --> 00:01:38,315
you need to think it through.

35
00:01:38,317 --> 00:01:40,601
Do you work here?

36
00:01:40,603 --> 00:01:42,019
Because if you do,
you're fired.

37
00:01:42,021 --> 00:01:44,772
I'm more like
an independent contractor.

38
00:01:44,774 --> 00:01:47,557
Now, you don't seem
like a bad guy, Bill.

39
00:01:47,559 --> 00:01:50,494
You and your wife
are having some problems.

40
00:01:50,496 --> 00:01:51,995
It happens.

41
00:01:51,997 --> 00:01:55,165
Well, some women
would just leave you.

42
00:01:55,167 --> 00:01:58,752
But some women, they might
just hire a couple of guys

43
00:01:58,754 --> 00:02:00,337
to come to your office,

44
00:02:00,339 --> 00:02:03,390
dismantle your
surveillance cameras

45
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:05,909
to make it look like
a robbery gone wrong.

Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

47
00:02:19,224 --> 00:02:22,142
I would call the police
and a good divorce lawyer.

48
00:02:36,325 --> 00:02:38,141
I've got a job for you.

49
00:02:38,143 --> 00:02:40,978
High priority.
Triple your usual fee.

50
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,797
What's the name?

51
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:53,173
Yeah.

52
00:02:53,175 --> 00:02:56,109
Good morning, Finch.

53
00:02:56,111 --> 00:02:58,011
No problems last night.

54
00:02:58,013 --> 00:03:00,597
Two hit men were waiting
to kill a guy,

55
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:01,849
just like you said they'd be.

56
00:03:01,851 --> 00:03:04,084
I took care of it.
Good.

57
00:03:04,086 --> 00:03:06,303
You should get some rest.

58
00:03:06,305 --> 00:03:08,105
Thought I'd do
a little research.

59
00:03:08,107 --> 00:03:11,058
I'll be interested
to hear what you discover.

60
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:13,193
We need to meet later.

61
00:03:13,195 --> 00:03:14,878
Your machine kick out
another number?

62
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,948
Somebody else is gonna
be involved in a crime?

63
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:20,934
This one is somewhat unusual.

64
00:03:20,936 --> 00:03:23,086
I'll let you know where to go.

65
00:03:23,088 --> 00:03:27,708
And, Mr. Reese,
we'll meet on my schedule.

66
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:30,878
Not yours.

67
00:03:31,829 --> 00:03:33,413
Detective Carter.

68
00:03:33,415 --> 00:03:34,715
Aren't you homicide?

69
00:03:34,717 --> 00:03:36,183
I don't have any
cold ones for you.

70
00:03:36,185 --> 00:03:38,452
Just a couple of guys ain't
ever gonna play golf again.

71
00:03:38,454 --> 00:03:40,821
Yeah, it's part of
an ongoing investigation.

72
00:03:40,823 --> 00:03:42,189
What do we know
about the shooter?

73
00:03:42,191 --> 00:03:43,774
This rich guy
was on his way home,

74
00:03:43,776 --> 00:03:45,392
said a couple of guys
tried to kill him,

75
00:03:45,394 --> 00:03:46,860
and this, uh, other gentleman

76
00:03:46,862 --> 00:03:49,813
quote "intervened," unquote.

77
00:03:49,815 --> 00:03:53,617
Let me guess.
Some guy in a suit.

78
00:03:58,373 --> 00:04:00,457
How did your research go?

79
00:04:00,459 --> 00:04:02,659
Inconclusive.

80
00:04:02,661 --> 00:04:04,795
The number we've received

81
00:04:04,797 --> 00:04:07,214
is for a girl named
Theresa Whitaker.

82
00:04:07,216 --> 00:04:09,750
15 years old.

83
00:04:09,752 --> 00:04:11,585
Some disciplinary trouble,

84
00:04:11,587 --> 00:04:15,372
but basically a good kid.

85
00:04:15,374 --> 00:04:18,708
Well, the machine
did spit out her number,

86
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:21,211
so she must be
caught up in something.

87
00:04:21,213 --> 00:04:23,814
Where can I find her?

88
00:04:26,184 --> 00:04:29,319
As I told you,
Mr. Reese,

89
00:04:29,321 --> 00:04:33,190
this situation
is somewhat unique.

90
00:04:33,192 --> 00:04:38,946
You see, Theresa Whitaker
should be right here.

91
00:04:41,899 --> 00:04:45,285
She was murdered, along with
the rest of her family.

92
00:04:45,287 --> 00:04:49,756
Two years ago.

93
00:04:49,758 --> 00:04:51,842
So we're looking for a ghost?

94
00:05:37,953 --> 00:05:39,903
I thought you might
still be here.

95
00:05:39,905 --> 00:05:42,105
I come bearing gifts.
Whisky.

96
00:05:42,107 --> 00:05:43,073
Ah ha.

97
00:05:43,075 --> 00:05:44,491
And we won another award.

98
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:48,611
Look, I know our deal.

99
00:05:48,613 --> 00:05:51,248
I schmooze the board,
I cash out the checks,

100
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,501
I pick up the awards.
You do most of the work.

101
00:05:54,503 --> 00:05:58,138
But, honestly, this is getting
exhausting for me.

102
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,724
I'm perfectly happy
with the division of labor.

103
00:06:00,726 --> 00:06:02,843
Always have been.

104
00:06:02,845 --> 00:06:04,461
What's this one for?

105
00:06:04,463 --> 00:06:07,681
This is for services
to humanity.

106
00:06:07,683 --> 00:06:09,683
I didn't tell them
that we laid off half the staff

107
00:06:09,685 --> 00:06:12,135
in order to build
this orwellian nightmare.

108
00:06:12,137 --> 00:06:13,737
Said you wanted
to make a difference,

109
00:06:13,739 --> 00:06:16,189
give something back.
This orwellian nightmare.

110
00:06:19,444 --> 00:06:21,194
Is this
is the government feeds?

111
00:06:21,196 --> 00:06:23,330
Direct from NSA at Fort Meade.

112
00:06:23,332 --> 00:06:26,649
That's every email,
every phone call,

113
00:06:26,651 --> 00:06:28,985
surveillance cameras...

114
00:06:28,987 --> 00:06:30,037
In the country?

115
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:32,655
No, that's just New York.

116
00:06:32,657 --> 00:06:34,007
I'm starting
with the basics here.

117
00:06:34,009 --> 00:06:35,459
I'm trying to teach it
to track people

118
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:36,793
using cell phone location data,

119
00:06:36,795 --> 00:06:38,161
facial recognition.

120
00:06:38,163 --> 00:06:40,497
I'm almost ready to move on
to the next problem.

121
00:06:40,499 --> 00:06:41,682
What's the next problem?

122
00:06:41,684 --> 00:06:43,934
Sorting them all out.

123
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:46,219
Terrorists don't exactly stand
out on street corners, you know?

124
00:06:46,221 --> 00:06:48,772
You have to teach the machine
to sift through the emails,

125
00:06:48,774 --> 00:06:51,674
wire-tapped phones,
bank transactions,

126
00:06:51,676 --> 00:06:53,944
looking for people
that are hiding something,

127
00:06:53,946 --> 00:06:56,079
living double lives.

128
00:06:56,081 --> 00:06:57,981
People like you,
in other words.

129
00:07:00,703 --> 00:07:02,018
How long will this take?

130
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:05,122
Four, five more years.

131
00:07:11,412 --> 00:07:13,547
So this is...

132
00:07:13,549 --> 00:07:16,049
Everyone.

133
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:22,289
♪ ♪

134
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,818
Nice spot.

135
00:07:39,056 --> 00:07:42,075
This is the last place
Theresa Whitaker was seen alive.

136
00:07:42,077 --> 00:07:43,777
Two years ago, her father Grant

137
00:07:43,779 --> 00:07:46,279
takes the family
for a weekend sail.

138
00:07:46,281 --> 00:07:48,665
No one comes home.

139
00:07:48,667 --> 00:07:50,333
Grant.

140
00:07:50,335 --> 00:07:52,735
He was a real estate developer.

141
00:07:52,737 --> 00:07:54,004
Market crashed.

142
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:56,923
He was upside down
on 14 properties.

143
00:07:56,925 --> 00:07:59,042
According to the police,

144
00:07:59,044 --> 00:08:00,260
he shot his wife and kids,

145
00:08:00,262 --> 00:08:02,429
then turned the gun on himself.

146
00:08:02,431 --> 00:08:05,432
Says here they found
the bodies.

147
00:08:05,434 --> 00:08:08,301
Just the parents
and the 18-year-old son.

148
00:08:08,303 --> 00:08:11,304
Theresa's body
was never recovered.

149
00:08:11,306 --> 00:08:13,807
Uh, "presumed dead"?

150
00:08:13,809 --> 00:08:15,776
That's a reasonable assumption.

151
00:08:15,778 --> 00:08:19,146
The police only see
what they choose to look for.

152
00:08:19,148 --> 00:08:22,783
The machine sees
almost everything.

153
00:08:22,785 --> 00:08:24,518
If the girl's number
has come up,

154
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,620
she must be alive.

155
00:08:26,622 --> 00:08:28,872
Then why hasn't she
shown up by now?

156
00:08:28,874 --> 00:08:31,107
With the police or a relative?

157
00:08:31,109 --> 00:08:33,160
I don't know.

158
00:08:33,162 --> 00:08:36,046
But if the machine is right
and she's still alive,

159
00:08:36,048 --> 00:08:38,415
she won't be for long.

160
00:08:39,617 --> 00:08:41,668
Better find her.

161
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:44,304
I'll need a police report
on this.

162
00:08:44,306 --> 00:08:47,674
I'll have to talk to my friend
in the department.

163
00:08:59,153 --> 00:09:00,854
Hello, Lionel.

164
00:09:00,856 --> 00:09:02,989
You. Again.

165
00:09:02,991 --> 00:09:04,474
How the hell'd you get in here?

166
00:09:04,476 --> 00:09:06,827
Took it off your friend stills.

167
00:09:06,829 --> 00:09:08,445
The one I shot with your gun

168
00:09:08,447 --> 00:09:11,331
before you buried him
out in oyster bay.

169
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:12,982
I need you to pull
a file for me.

170
00:09:12,984 --> 00:09:15,502
Yeah. Right after
you pull my IAD file.

171
00:09:15,504 --> 00:09:17,671
'Cause they got me
one step from fighting off

172
00:09:17,673 --> 00:09:20,156
a whole cellblock of degenerates
that I sent upstate.

173
00:09:20,158 --> 00:09:21,842
They think I'm dirty.

174
00:09:21,844 --> 00:09:24,344
That's because
you are dirty, Lionel.

175
00:09:24,346 --> 00:09:28,298
Look, your predicament
is not my doing or my concern.

176
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,217
Name's Theresa Whitaker.

177
00:09:30,219 --> 00:09:35,004
Two-year-old murder-suicide
out in Bowery Bay.

178
00:09:35,006 --> 00:09:37,190
Get me the file.

179
00:09:44,065 --> 00:09:47,484
I just can't believe
that it came to this.

180
00:09:47,486 --> 00:09:50,186
We knew they were having,
uh, financial issues,

181
00:09:50,188 --> 00:09:52,021
but I never--
I never thought

182
00:09:52,023 --> 00:09:53,690
that he would do
anything like this.

183
00:09:53,692 --> 00:09:55,458
That's because he didn't.

184
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:58,712
Wish that he would have...
Come to me.

185
00:09:58,714 --> 00:10:01,898
Wish he would have reached out.

186
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:04,200
This was a professional hit.

187
00:10:04,202 --> 00:10:07,504
Muzzle impressions
were made after the fact,

188
00:10:07,506 --> 00:10:09,789
made it look point blank,

189
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:10,924
like the father did it.

190
00:10:10,926 --> 00:10:12,425
Cops missed it.

191
00:10:12,427 --> 00:10:13,710
And you know that how?

192
00:10:13,712 --> 00:10:16,663
That's how I
would have done it.

193
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:22,402
So why didn't the shooter
kill Theresa?

194
00:10:22,404 --> 00:10:24,020
That part I can't explain,

195
00:10:24,022 --> 00:10:26,106
or why she hasn't
shown up anywhere else.

196
00:10:26,108 --> 00:10:27,524
I've tracked down
a recent address

197
00:10:27,526 --> 00:10:29,576
for the aunt and uncle
in Brooklyn Heights.

198
00:10:29,578 --> 00:10:32,579
They might know what kind of
trouble Whitaker was in.

199
00:10:32,581 --> 00:10:33,947
I got a lead on another kid

200
00:10:33,949 --> 00:10:36,449
who might know her whereabouts.

201
00:10:36,451 --> 00:10:38,501
Sealed juvie record on Theresa.

202
00:10:38,503 --> 00:10:40,954
Seems she was picked up
with an older boy for vandalism,

203
00:10:40,956 --> 00:10:42,289
Deacon Page.

204
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:45,241
Since, he's been popped
multiple times for shoplifting,

205
00:10:45,243 --> 00:10:46,543
carrying a concealed weapon.

206
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:48,628
So if Theresa
didn't go to family,

207
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:51,581
maybe she went to friends.

208
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:53,850
But we don't know how much
time Theresa has left.

209
00:10:53,852 --> 00:10:56,419
Might need a little help,
Finch.

210
00:11:06,231 --> 00:11:09,733
Hello. Arthur Bellinger,
Liberty State Mutual.

211
00:11:09,735 --> 00:11:11,034
Elizabeth Whitaker?

212
00:11:11,036 --> 00:11:12,268
Yes?

213
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:15,989
We wrote the term life
policies for Grant Whitaker.

214
00:11:15,991 --> 00:11:19,709
You and your husband Derek
are listed as next of kin?

215
00:11:19,711 --> 00:11:20,660
Ex-husband.

216
00:11:20,662 --> 00:11:22,996
The divorce
went through last year.

217
00:11:22,998 --> 00:11:25,081
Come in.
Thank you.

218
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:28,668
In cases like this involving
prolonged legal investigation,

219
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:31,004
it can take some time
to settle out.

220
00:11:31,006 --> 00:11:32,472
I'm surprised
my brother-in-law

221
00:11:32,474 --> 00:11:35,124
even kept up payments
on life insurance.

222
00:11:35,126 --> 00:11:36,726
Does this mean
that they're gonna

223
00:11:36,728 --> 00:11:38,979
stop searching for Theresa?

224
00:11:38,981 --> 00:11:41,231
Her body, I mean?

225
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:43,516
The police have concluded
their investigation.

226
00:11:43,518 --> 00:11:45,635
You weren't satisfied?

227
00:11:45,637 --> 00:11:48,021
No, it's-- It's just...

228
00:11:48,023 --> 00:11:49,939
We buried an empty coffin.

229
00:11:49,941 --> 00:11:56,196
They-- They said that the current
would have taken her body,

230
00:11:56,198 --> 00:12:01,835
and I was hoping that maybe
it would bring her home.

231
00:12:01,837 --> 00:12:03,152
I'm sorry.

232
00:12:03,154 --> 00:12:05,622
This is just drudging up
some really difficult memories.

233
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:09,809
Not at all.
I can only imagine.

234
00:12:09,811 --> 00:12:12,178
Derek never
came out of the funk.

235
00:12:13,815 --> 00:12:16,433
Sometimes you just lose people.

236
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:18,000
You don't have
any contact information

237
00:12:18,002 --> 00:12:19,386
for your ex-husband, do you?

238
00:12:19,388 --> 00:12:21,855
No, we've barely spoken
since we split.

239
00:12:21,857 --> 00:12:23,523
I have a-- An old
cell phone number.

240
00:12:23,525 --> 00:12:26,443
Good luck tracking him down.

241
00:12:26,445 --> 00:12:29,112
You might want to mention
that there's money involved.

242
00:12:29,114 --> 00:12:30,113
I have to ask this.

243
00:12:30,115 --> 00:12:31,614
Did you and Derek
have any children?

244
00:12:31,616 --> 00:12:33,683
No kids.

245
00:12:33,685 --> 00:12:37,520
Now I'm not even an aunt.

246
00:12:37,522 --> 00:12:40,189
Smart as a whip, Theresa.

247
00:12:40,191 --> 00:12:43,543
I loved her like
she was my own daughter.

248
00:12:43,545 --> 00:12:48,231
Unfortunately,
you can't pick your parents.

249
00:12:48,233 --> 00:12:50,550
Unbelievable.

250
00:12:50,552 --> 00:12:53,386
I've got eight case files
connected to this guy's prints,

251
00:12:53,388 --> 00:12:55,638
and half of them
have been redacted.

252
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:59,175
Here we go.
Missing persons '07.

253
00:12:59,177 --> 00:13:00,560
Your trigger happy hobo,
Carter.

254
00:13:00,562 --> 00:13:02,378
Only now he's a killer
in a suit.

255
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:04,347
Well, maybe he's
a recovering diplomat.

256
00:13:04,349 --> 00:13:06,099
They pulled the whole file.

257
00:13:06,101 --> 00:13:08,902
Feds. This one's above
your pay grade, Carter.

258
00:13:11,572 --> 00:13:14,107
Aunt's fine.
Uncle's MIA.

259
00:13:14,109 --> 00:13:15,775
MIA?

260
00:13:15,777 --> 00:13:17,577
You got no contact info?

261
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:19,913
No answer on the cell phone.
No forwarding address.

262
00:13:19,915 --> 00:13:21,197
Where are you?

263
00:13:21,199 --> 00:13:23,316
I've been to every
skate-rat park in the city.

264
00:13:23,318 --> 00:13:25,368
Nothing but attitude on wheels.

265
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:29,622
No sign of Theresa?

266
00:13:29,624 --> 00:13:34,577
No, but I think
I just found our guy.

267
00:13:40,601 --> 00:13:42,118
What the--?

268
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,686
What's your problem, fool?

269
00:13:43,688 --> 00:13:46,356
$200 fine to skate in the park.

270
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:49,859
Want to know the last time
you seen this girl, Deacon.

271
00:13:49,861 --> 00:13:51,561
What is this?
Some kind of sick joke?

272
00:13:51,563 --> 00:13:53,262
News flash, chief.

273
00:13:53,264 --> 00:13:55,264
Old man went postal
on her whole family.

274
00:13:55,266 --> 00:13:56,483
She's dead.

275
00:13:56,485 --> 00:13:57,400
Or maybe not.

276
00:13:57,402 --> 00:13:58,701
Maybe you seen her around,
chief.

277
00:13:58,703 --> 00:14:01,604
That girl's gone.
Give me back my phone.

278
00:14:11,665 --> 00:14:13,967
Is he riding you?
What's up with that, man?

279
00:14:32,654 --> 00:14:38,908
♪ ♪

280
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:41,411
Theresa.

281
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,948
Theresa.

282
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:47,750
Wait.

283
00:14:52,506 --> 00:14:54,791
Watch it, idiot!

284
00:15:25,003 --> 00:15:26,170
Hi, Harold.

285
00:15:26,172 --> 00:15:28,256
Hello.

286
00:15:34,379 --> 00:15:36,514
Morning, Harold.

287
00:15:36,516 --> 00:15:40,718
Listen, um, that database
you're coding,

288
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,388
we're gonna need it
a little faster, okay?

289
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:45,907
You-- You got to keep up.

290
00:15:45,909 --> 00:15:49,360
Okay. I'll see
what I can do, Dave.

291
00:15:55,751 --> 00:15:59,036
Not exactly what I expected.

292
00:15:59,038 --> 00:16:02,006
Software engineer of the month.

293
00:16:02,008 --> 00:16:03,407
That's very impressive.

294
00:16:03,409 --> 00:16:06,911
But it doesn't quite explain
the private security,

295
00:16:06,913 --> 00:16:08,679
the unlimited funds.

296
00:16:08,681 --> 00:16:13,100
No.
No, it wouldn't.

297
00:16:13,102 --> 00:16:16,086
I did some digging down in HR.

298
00:16:16,088 --> 00:16:19,223
Seems you've worked here
for 17 years.

299
00:16:19,225 --> 00:16:23,194
Only been promoted twice.

300
00:16:23,196 --> 00:16:27,097
So how many of these people
know you own the entire company?

301
00:16:27,099 --> 00:16:28,533
None of them.

302
00:16:28,535 --> 00:16:32,370
The best place to hide,
Mr. Reese, as you well know,

303
00:16:32,372 --> 00:16:34,489
is in plain sight.

304
00:16:34,491 --> 00:16:36,407
And if I speak too loudly,

305
00:16:36,409 --> 00:16:37,992
say the wrong thing?

306
00:16:37,994 --> 00:16:40,995
The entire department
could be overhauled.

307
00:16:40,997 --> 00:16:45,616
Some would be reassigned,
promoted.

308
00:16:45,618 --> 00:16:49,303
Some would be fired.

309
00:16:49,305 --> 00:16:51,889
I'll make it quick, then.

310
00:16:51,891 --> 00:16:54,392
The good news,
the girl is alive.

311
00:16:54,394 --> 00:16:56,677
And, uh, kicking.

312
00:16:56,679 --> 00:16:59,129
Seems she has
some trust issues.

313
00:16:59,131 --> 00:17:02,733
I, uh, I lost her.

314
00:17:02,735 --> 00:17:05,603
But I did figure out how she's
been providing for herself.

315
00:17:05,605 --> 00:17:08,639
She left this
at an atm machine.

316
00:17:08,641 --> 00:17:09,740
It's a skimmer.

317
00:17:09,742 --> 00:17:14,478
It captures
account numbers and pins.

318
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,197
If she tries
to sell these online,

319
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:18,082
I might be able
to track her down.

320
00:17:18,084 --> 00:17:19,984
In the meantime,
we need to figure out

321
00:17:19,986 --> 00:17:21,919
who killed her family and why.

322
00:17:21,921 --> 00:17:24,455
Her uncle's hiding from
a dozen different creditors,

323
00:17:24,457 --> 00:17:26,340
but I'll find him.

324
00:17:26,342 --> 00:17:28,993
And I want to look
at Grant Whitaker's finances

325
00:17:28,995 --> 00:17:30,628
much more carefully.

326
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:31,829
Good.

327
00:17:31,831 --> 00:17:33,714
'Cause this was a hit for hire,

328
00:17:33,716 --> 00:17:35,683
and I'm gonna
look into the shooter.

329
00:17:35,685 --> 00:17:36,884
How?

330
00:17:36,886 --> 00:17:39,353
Find out where I can hire one.

331
00:17:44,359 --> 00:17:48,112
So who's your friend, Harold?

332
00:17:53,435 --> 00:17:55,853
Guy behind the bar's a fixer.

333
00:17:55,855 --> 00:17:59,890
Takes a piece of most
contract killings in the city.

334
00:17:59,892 --> 00:18:01,709
If someone did
wipe out the family,

335
00:18:01,711 --> 00:18:03,661
he might know who did it.

336
00:18:03,663 --> 00:18:05,212
Hey, he don't talk to people

337
00:18:05,214 --> 00:18:06,581
who just walk into the joint.

338
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:08,799
Lionel, you worried about me?

339
00:18:08,801 --> 00:18:11,702
I'm touched.

340
00:18:29,938 --> 00:18:32,974
Don't let me see you
around here again.

341
00:18:45,755 --> 00:18:50,591
♪ ♪

342
00:19:10,979 --> 00:19:13,230
Got a name.

343
00:19:13,232 --> 00:19:15,282
Let's go.

344
00:19:15,284 --> 00:19:17,201
Fusco's CI.
Pointed me towards

345
00:19:17,203 --> 00:19:18,853
a contract killer
named Solnick.

346
00:19:18,855 --> 00:19:22,289
Problem is Solnick got himself
locked up for a separate job,

347
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:23,491
so I've arranged a visit.

348
00:19:40,142 --> 00:19:41,509
Who are you?

349
00:19:41,511 --> 00:19:42,793
Did my lawyer quit again?

350
00:19:42,795 --> 00:19:44,128
No.

351
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:47,181
I'd like to talk to you
about that family you murdered,

352
00:19:47,183 --> 00:19:50,067
then dumped in the Bowery Bay.

353
00:19:50,069 --> 00:19:52,603
What, you don't want
to talk about that one?

354
00:19:52,605 --> 00:19:55,773
How about some of
the other people you killed?

355
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:57,942
Like that brother
of that gang leader

356
00:19:57,944 --> 00:19:59,443
that lives on your cell block.

357
00:19:59,445 --> 00:20:02,997
I'm sure he'd love to know
his brother's last words.

358
00:20:02,999 --> 00:20:05,416
Hmm?

359
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:09,987
I get it.

360
00:20:09,989 --> 00:20:11,839
You're like me.

361
00:20:11,841 --> 00:20:13,323
A killer.

362
00:20:13,325 --> 00:20:16,594
A genuine bad guy.

363
00:20:16,596 --> 00:20:18,546
Then I don't have
to explain to you

364
00:20:18,548 --> 00:20:20,965
what happened
to those people on that boat.

365
00:20:20,967 --> 00:20:22,683
You already know.

366
00:20:22,685 --> 00:20:24,268
But what I don't know

367
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:27,104
is why you let the girl live.

368
00:20:27,106 --> 00:20:28,689
I wouldn't
have killed the girl.

369
00:20:28,691 --> 00:20:31,842
Not even if
they paid me my quote.

370
00:20:31,844 --> 00:20:33,644
I told her anyone
ever knew she was alive,

371
00:20:33,646 --> 00:20:36,063
I'd finish the job.

372
00:20:36,065 --> 00:20:38,282
I don't kill kids.

373
00:20:38,284 --> 00:20:41,235
Had some punk
on my cell block last week

374
00:20:41,237 --> 00:20:42,686
say he heard I did.

375
00:20:42,688 --> 00:20:44,155
I told him the same thing.

376
00:20:44,157 --> 00:20:46,690
Who hired you to do it?

377
00:20:46,692 --> 00:20:49,043
Some guy I met one time.

378
00:20:49,045 --> 00:20:54,465
No names. Cash.

379
00:20:54,467 --> 00:20:57,084
Who hired you?

380
00:20:59,104 --> 00:21:01,505
Guys who kill kids
aren't popular in jail.

381
00:21:01,507 --> 00:21:03,140
Solnick's been
defending his honor.

382
00:21:03,142 --> 00:21:04,258
The people that hired him

383
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:06,177
may have found out
he didn't kill Theresa.

384
00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:09,396
Maybe they hired somebody new
to finish the job.

385
00:21:09,398 --> 00:21:11,165
Why are they so worried
about a teenager?

386
00:21:11,167 --> 00:21:12,099
I don't know.

387
00:21:12,101 --> 00:21:14,502
But we need
to figure it out fast.

388
00:21:14,504 --> 00:21:17,271
Oh, I think I may have a lead.

389
00:21:17,273 --> 00:21:18,823
Whitaker was sole investor

390
00:21:18,825 --> 00:21:21,492
in all his real estate deals
except one.

391
00:21:21,494 --> 00:21:23,077
He bought a couple
of parcels of landstor

392
00:21:23,079 --> 00:21:26,330
with the real estate
holding company Landale.

393
00:21:26,332 --> 00:21:28,565
Landale.
Send me the address.

394
00:21:28,567 --> 00:21:31,418
I'm on my way.

395
00:21:43,298 --> 00:21:45,766
Landale financial,
second floor.

396
00:21:45,768 --> 00:21:47,818
30 million or so in holdings.

397
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:50,855
Principal is a guy
named Calhoun.

398
00:21:50,857 --> 00:21:52,923
Well, Calhoun's got
a lot of security

399
00:21:52,925 --> 00:21:55,226
for a real estate developer.

400
00:21:55,228 --> 00:21:59,146
Wait a second.
Who's this?

401
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:05,653
I think I just found
Theresa's uncle Derek.

402
00:22:05,655 --> 00:22:08,739
Why would he turn up here?

403
00:22:08,741 --> 00:22:10,624
That's gonna have to wait.

404
00:22:10,626 --> 00:22:13,627
Theresa just tried to sell
those account numbers online.

405
00:22:13,629 --> 00:22:17,047
I'm tracing the IP address
where she logged on.

406
00:22:17,049 --> 00:22:19,133
It's at 89th and West End.

407
00:22:19,135 --> 00:22:21,352
Get moving.

408
00:22:21,354 --> 00:22:22,953
Is it a wireless network?

409
00:22:22,955 --> 00:22:24,421
It is.

410
00:22:24,423 --> 00:22:27,675
Maybe she's in one
of the surrounding buildings.

411
00:22:38,803 --> 00:22:40,688
Hey.

412
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:43,490
You got me pretty good
back there.

413
00:22:43,492 --> 00:22:47,361
Not-- Not looking
for a rematch.

414
00:22:47,363 --> 00:22:51,582
I know what happened
to you and your family.

415
00:22:51,584 --> 00:22:52,833
I'm here to help you.

416
00:22:52,835 --> 00:22:54,285
Just leave me alone.

417
00:22:54,287 --> 00:22:56,337
The man that killed
your family's in jail.

418
00:22:56,339 --> 00:22:58,923
No one's gonna hurt you again.

419
00:22:58,925 --> 00:23:01,658
'Cause I won't let them.

420
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:04,494
You really shouldn't
lie to kids.

421
00:23:14,439 --> 00:23:16,724
Aah!
Ugh!

422
00:24:11,029 --> 00:24:15,732
Theresa.
Are you gonna trust me now?

423
00:24:15,734 --> 00:24:17,067
I don't know you.

424
00:24:17,069 --> 00:24:19,920
You're gonna need
to trust someone.

425
00:24:30,278 --> 00:24:31,479
Don't worry.

426
00:24:31,481 --> 00:24:33,864
You're safe here.

427
00:24:38,286 --> 00:24:40,204
Ordered you room service.

428
00:24:40,206 --> 00:24:43,324
It's a $50 cheeseburger.

429
00:24:46,545 --> 00:24:48,445
Theresa.

430
00:24:50,048 --> 00:24:52,282
The man who came after you
at the laundry mat,

431
00:24:52,284 --> 00:24:54,552
you ever see him before?

432
00:24:54,554 --> 00:24:57,788
Do you have any idea
who targeted your family?

433
00:24:57,790 --> 00:24:59,006
No.

434
00:24:59,008 --> 00:25:01,559
Did it have anything
to do with your uncle Derek?

435
00:25:01,561 --> 00:25:02,927
Is that why
you didn't come to him?

436
00:25:02,929 --> 00:25:04,294
I don't trust him.

437
00:25:04,296 --> 00:25:06,013
Why?

438
00:25:06,015 --> 00:25:08,649
What my dad said,

439
00:25:08,651 --> 00:25:11,969
before that man
put a bullet in his head,

440
00:25:11,971 --> 00:25:15,138
he said it was Derek's fault.

441
00:25:30,288 --> 00:25:31,288
Hello.

442
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:32,823
Theresa, this is Harold,

443
00:25:32,825 --> 00:25:34,708
and he's gonna stay with you.

444
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:35,826
Nice room.

445
00:25:35,828 --> 00:25:37,761
Took the liberty
of booking all four.

446
00:25:37,763 --> 00:25:39,263
Your card.

447
00:25:39,265 --> 00:25:41,182
Guess I can use the miles.

448
00:25:41,184 --> 00:25:43,500
Theresa can't be left alone.

449
00:25:43,502 --> 00:25:47,054
Here.
I better take this.

450
00:25:47,056 --> 00:25:51,225
And, uh, this.

451
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:54,228
I need you
to stay here with Harold.

452
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:56,230
He'll take care of you.

453
00:25:56,232 --> 00:25:58,065
Where are you going?

454
00:25:58,067 --> 00:26:04,121
I'm gonna pay a man a visit.

455
00:26:04,123 --> 00:26:06,073
I have the uncle's
cell phone account.

456
00:26:06,075 --> 00:26:07,541
The GPS signal is active,

457
00:26:07,543 --> 00:26:08,659
but he's not answering.

458
00:26:08,661 --> 00:26:10,794
Landale's involved.

459
00:26:10,796 --> 00:26:15,966
I'm just not sure why
they're still coming after her.

460
00:26:15,968 --> 00:26:18,252
Don't dawdle.

461
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:34,384
What the hell?

462
00:26:38,107 --> 00:26:39,690
What's the matter, Derek?

463
00:26:39,692 --> 00:26:42,576
You don't want to talk
to your dead brother?

464
00:26:44,829 --> 00:26:46,030
Get in the truck.

465
00:26:46,032 --> 00:26:48,899
I'll drive.

466
00:26:48,901 --> 00:26:51,835
Yeah, Derek, we need to talk.

467
00:26:51,837 --> 00:26:53,337
I left you a couple messages

468
00:26:53,339 --> 00:26:56,790
about the insurance guy
who came by, asking questions.

469
00:26:56,792 --> 00:26:58,092
He wants to talk to you.

470
00:26:58,094 --> 00:27:02,630
Something about Grant's assets
coming out of probate.

471
00:27:02,632 --> 00:27:04,915
I gave him your cell.

472
00:27:04,917 --> 00:27:08,302
Anyway, call me back please.

473
00:27:08,304 --> 00:27:11,272
Sometime this year?

474
00:27:18,363 --> 00:27:21,198
Remember this place, Derek?

475
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,233
Where they dumped
your brother's whole family

476
00:27:23,235 --> 00:27:25,069
in the water like chum.

477
00:27:25,071 --> 00:27:26,954
What are you talking about?

478
00:27:26,956 --> 00:27:28,622
I'm talking business, Derek.

479
00:27:28,624 --> 00:27:31,208
Landale Financial,
where you were yesterday.

480
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:32,126
Who the hell are you?

481
00:27:32,128 --> 00:27:33,961
That deal your
brother Grant made,

482
00:27:33,963 --> 00:27:36,880
greenpoint, bunch of land
out in Brooklyn

483
00:27:36,882 --> 00:27:38,832
ruined by an oil spill.

484
00:27:38,834 --> 00:27:40,868
And now you're cutting a deal
with him, aren't you?

485
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:42,619
I tried to help Grant.

486
00:27:42,621 --> 00:27:44,088
You helped him, all right.

487
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:47,224
Right into an early grave.
With no will.

488
00:27:47,226 --> 00:27:49,510
Which means that land
goes into probate,

489
00:27:49,512 --> 00:27:51,461
and then to you, Derek.

490
00:27:51,463 --> 00:27:56,183
Let me ask you this.

491
00:27:56,185 --> 00:27:58,569
Did you hire
the hit man yourself,

492
00:27:58,571 --> 00:28:00,187
or did you let Landale do it?

493
00:28:00,189 --> 00:28:02,239
I never meant
for anyone to get hurt.

494
00:28:02,241 --> 00:28:05,743
Grant, he swore that greenpoint
was gonna be the big one.

495
00:28:05,745 --> 00:28:07,911
He just didn't have enough
to cover all the parcels,

496
00:28:07,913 --> 00:28:09,813
so I told him
I know these guys.

497
00:28:09,815 --> 00:28:12,282
Calhoun. Landale.

498
00:28:12,284 --> 00:28:13,667
It all looked legit.

499
00:28:13,669 --> 00:28:15,419
It was a front for dirty money.

500
00:28:15,421 --> 00:28:17,671
And you set your brother
up with them.

501
00:28:17,673 --> 00:28:20,724
Grant swore that
it was gonna be a ten-bagger

502
00:28:20,726 --> 00:28:22,993
as soon as the government
cleaned up the site.

503
00:28:22,995 --> 00:28:24,712
But, like everything
with the government,

504
00:28:24,714 --> 00:28:25,713
it took too damn long.

505
00:28:25,715 --> 00:28:27,998
Landale wanted
their money immediately.

506
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,617
So they took him out along
with everyone in his family

507
00:28:30,619 --> 00:28:32,803
just to get their money
back out.

508
00:28:32,805 --> 00:28:35,055
They made me
the administer of probate.

509
00:28:35,057 --> 00:28:38,809
That's the only reason
why they didn't kill me.

510
00:28:38,811 --> 00:28:42,563
I'm supposed to sign it
over to 'em next week.

511
00:28:44,348 --> 00:28:47,684
You know, the kicker is
that Grant was right.

512
00:28:47,686 --> 00:28:49,987
Government came through.
They cleaned up the site.

513
00:28:49,989 --> 00:28:53,857
Now it's worth 20, 30 times
what they put into it.

514
00:28:53,859 --> 00:28:56,960
So that's why they're still
coming after her.

515
00:28:56,962 --> 00:29:00,080
Theresa is the legal heir
to that property.

516
00:29:00,082 --> 00:29:01,698
Theres-- What are you
talking about?

517
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:02,699
She's dead.

518
00:29:02,701 --> 00:29:04,051
She's alive.

519
00:29:04,053 --> 00:29:05,535
No thanks to you.

520
00:29:05,537 --> 00:29:09,723
If you'd come forward,
cleared your brother's name,

521
00:29:09,725 --> 00:29:12,092
she might not have spent
the last two years hiding.

522
00:29:12,094 --> 00:29:16,379
From you.

523
00:29:16,381 --> 00:29:18,766
You know, I went to see
your aunt Elizabeth.

524
00:29:18,768 --> 00:29:21,018
She seems like a lovely person.

525
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,686
You tell her about me?

526
00:29:22,688 --> 00:29:25,489
No. Of course not.

527
00:29:25,491 --> 00:29:29,993
But she did mention
how much she missed you.

528
00:29:29,995 --> 00:29:34,081
She even showed me
an old photo.

529
00:29:34,083 --> 00:29:37,901
You know, there's no changing
what happened to your family,

530
00:29:37,903 --> 00:29:40,788
but you do have someone
out there that loves you.

531
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:43,474
Yeah?
What do you know?

532
00:29:43,476 --> 00:29:47,511
I know what it's like
to lose someone.

533
00:29:47,513 --> 00:29:51,748
And to feel the need
to disappear.

534
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:56,069
But, trust me, you don't want
to leave people behind.

535
00:30:16,624 --> 00:30:20,944
When were you going to tell me?

536
00:30:20,946 --> 00:30:24,131
I wasn't gonna tell you,
I guess.

537
00:30:24,133 --> 00:30:27,417
I'd rather
I didn't know myself.

538
00:30:27,419 --> 00:30:29,803
All these people.

539
00:30:29,805 --> 00:30:31,989
And this damn machine knew.

540
00:30:31,991 --> 00:30:33,557
You knew...

541
00:30:33,559 --> 00:30:35,859
That someone wanted
to harm them,

542
00:30:35,861 --> 00:30:40,597
kill them...

543
00:30:40,599 --> 00:30:42,933
And you did nothing?

544
00:30:42,935 --> 00:30:48,739
You knew what
we were building here.

545
00:30:48,741 --> 00:30:52,860
This thing looks for plotters,
for schemers.

546
00:30:52,862 --> 00:30:54,611
It looks for malicious intent.

547
00:30:54,613 --> 00:30:57,281
We built it to stop terrorists
before they could act.

548
00:30:57,283 --> 00:30:59,616
But a machine doesn't
understand the difference

549
00:30:59,618 --> 00:31:02,819
between those crimes that are
relevant to national security

550
00:31:02,821 --> 00:31:06,323
and the ones
that are irrelevant.

551
00:31:07,992 --> 00:31:13,013
Irrelevant?

552
00:31:13,015 --> 00:31:15,966
So you taught it
the difference?

553
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:17,885
You want to play God?
Is that the deal?

554
00:31:17,887 --> 00:31:20,771
No, I don't.
That's the whole point.

555
00:31:20,773 --> 00:31:22,472
There are exactly
eight people in the world

556
00:31:22,474 --> 00:31:24,641
that know
that this thing exists.

557
00:31:24,643 --> 00:31:26,143
If anyone else ever found out,

558
00:31:26,145 --> 00:31:30,513
there'd be such an outcry...
They'd turn it off.

559
00:31:30,515 --> 00:31:33,734
The intelligence
the machine produces

560
00:31:33,736 --> 00:31:39,239
has already foiled a half dozen
major terrorist plots.

561
00:31:39,241 --> 00:31:41,524
How are we supposed
to live with this,

562
00:31:41,526 --> 00:31:44,878
knowing that someone
out there needs help?

563
00:31:47,465 --> 00:31:48,715
Well, we don't have to.

564
00:31:48,717 --> 00:31:51,552
I've coded the machine.

565
00:31:51,554 --> 00:31:53,036
Every night at midnight,

566
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:56,256
it deletes the irrelevant list.

567
00:31:56,258 --> 00:31:59,893
We didn't build this
to save somebody.

568
00:31:59,895 --> 00:32:03,546
We built it to save everybody.

569
00:32:13,908 --> 00:32:16,243
Where's the girl?

570
00:32:19,163 --> 00:32:22,416
Kid's worth a fortune, Finch.

571
00:32:22,418 --> 00:32:25,285
Land the father bought
panned out fifty fold.

572
00:32:25,287 --> 00:32:26,620
And Landale wants it all.

573
00:32:26,622 --> 00:32:27,788
Killed the whole family.

574
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:29,706
Expected to clean up
after it cleared probate.

575
00:32:29,708 --> 00:32:31,842
'Til they found out
the girl was still alive.

576
00:32:31,844 --> 00:32:33,410
Do we know who ordered the hit?

577
00:32:33,412 --> 00:32:36,179
Calhoun, the father's
business partner.

578
00:32:36,181 --> 00:32:37,848
I've got eyes on him.

579
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:40,917
And he's walking.

580
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:42,919
So's Theresa.
Got to go.

581
00:32:45,223 --> 00:32:47,391
Wait. Theresa.

582
00:32:47,393 --> 00:32:49,226
You know I can't
keep up with you.

583
00:32:49,228 --> 00:32:51,361
Can I ask you
where you're going?

584
00:32:51,363 --> 00:32:52,663
I'm better off alone.

585
00:32:52,665 --> 00:32:54,948
And how's that?

586
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:56,450
It's safer.

587
00:32:56,452 --> 00:32:58,652
I don't think so.

588
00:32:58,654 --> 00:33:00,320
Please.

589
00:33:00,322 --> 00:33:01,771
Sooner or later,

590
00:33:01,773 --> 00:33:03,940
you're gonna have
to trust someone.

591
00:33:07,662 --> 00:33:10,447
You can't kill me.

592
00:33:10,449 --> 00:33:13,800
They need me.

593
00:33:13,802 --> 00:33:17,004
See...

594
00:33:17,006 --> 00:33:22,976
You have vastly overestimated
your value in this process.

595
00:33:24,429 --> 00:33:28,649
They'll just hire
another couple of lawyers.

596
00:33:28,651 --> 00:33:31,234
So.

597
00:33:31,236 --> 00:33:34,888
I'll ask you one more time.

598
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:37,407
Where's the girl?

599
00:33:42,246 --> 00:33:44,831
Kiss my ass.

600
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:57,044
Can't tell you how much

601
00:33:57,046 --> 00:33:59,596
we appreciate your patience
and support on this, councilman.

602
00:33:59,598 --> 00:34:01,381
You're sure we're
free and clear on this?

603
00:34:01,383 --> 00:34:04,000
Rezoned for residential.

604
00:34:04,002 --> 00:34:06,136
Hell, you can break ground
as early as next month.

605
00:34:06,138 --> 00:34:07,804
Jimmy Calhoun.

606
00:34:07,806 --> 00:34:08,755
I got to hand it to you.

607
00:34:08,757 --> 00:34:10,440
You really turned
this thing around,

608
00:34:10,442 --> 00:34:12,509
saw what nobody else did
on the property.

609
00:34:12,511 --> 00:34:14,277
This is a real game-changer.

610
00:34:14,279 --> 00:34:15,362
Thank you, sir.

611
00:34:15,364 --> 00:34:17,564
The good people of Brooklyn
deserve it, sir.

612
00:34:17,566 --> 00:34:19,983
Look forward to it, Jim.

613
00:34:26,741 --> 00:34:28,291
- Hey.
- Hey.

614
00:34:28,293 --> 00:34:29,609
Neighbor called it in.

615
00:34:29,611 --> 00:34:30,911
Thought they heard a dispute.

616
00:34:30,913 --> 00:34:32,162
A dispute.

617
00:34:32,164 --> 00:34:34,081
- Yeah.
- You think?

618
00:34:34,083 --> 00:34:36,166
Yeah, thank goodness
for vigilant neighbors, huh?

619
00:34:36,168 --> 00:34:41,388
Oh, yeah. Found this
stuffed in his mouth.

620
00:34:41,390 --> 00:34:44,508
We got to find out
who this girl is.

621
00:35:02,243 --> 00:35:04,394
Hello?

622
00:35:04,396 --> 00:35:07,564
Hello?

623
00:35:07,566 --> 00:35:09,249
Who is this?

624
00:35:09,251 --> 00:35:11,785
Hello?

625
00:35:23,848 --> 00:35:26,183
Thank you for calling
The Fenwick, New York.

626
00:35:26,185 --> 00:35:28,268
How can I assist you?

627
00:35:55,330 --> 00:36:00,283
♪ ♪

628
00:36:03,254 --> 00:36:05,755
Sorry.

629
00:36:05,757 --> 00:36:08,958
You really need to watch
where you're going.

630
00:36:13,297 --> 00:36:14,964
Call off the dogs.

631
00:36:14,966 --> 00:36:18,134
Theresa Whitaker.
Right now.

632
00:36:18,136 --> 00:36:19,769
It's too--
It's too late.

633

It's done.
It's already done.

634
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:28,978
He's coming, Finch.
Get off that floor.

635
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:31,865
We have to go.
Now.

636
00:37:15,542 --> 00:37:18,377
I can see him.

637
00:37:18,379 --> 00:37:24,216
He's coming down the hall.

638
00:37:24,218 --> 00:37:25,401
He's going for the fuse box.

639
00:37:25,403 --> 00:37:27,153
He's gonna cut out the lights
in the hallway.

640
00:37:27,155 --> 00:37:29,221
He's gonna see the lights
in our room.

641
00:37:29,223 --> 00:37:32,124
Quick.
Turn 'em all off.

642
00:38:05,258 --> 00:38:06,726
I told you we should have left.

643
00:38:06,728 --> 00:38:09,311
You did.
I'm sorry.

644
00:38:18,572 --> 00:38:21,540
Give me your phone.

645
00:38:22,826 --> 00:38:24,443
What are we doing?
I don't understand.

646
00:38:24,445 --> 00:38:26,712
- Just--just...
- Wait. Hurry up.

647
00:38:28,281 --> 00:38:29,298
- Shh.
- Let's go.

648
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:32,301
Shh. Shh.
Don't...

649
00:38:32,303 --> 00:38:33,552
This isn't gonna work.

650
00:38:33,554 --> 00:38:35,254
He's coming.
He's right outside the door.

651
00:38:35,256 --> 00:38:37,723
I know.
I know he is.

652
00:38:42,429 --> 00:38:43,462
No, no, no.
Too slow.

653
00:38:43,464 --> 00:38:47,149
Come on.
This way.

654
00:38:56,777 --> 00:39:00,196
We haven't got much time.

655
00:39:02,982 --> 00:39:05,084
He's here.

656
00:39:05,086 --> 00:39:07,369
Fire escape.
You can go down.

657
00:39:07,371 --> 00:39:10,623
Come on.
Go. Go.

658
00:39:10,625 --> 00:39:13,325
You coming?

659
00:39:13,327 --> 00:39:14,326
I can't get through there.

660
00:39:14,328 --> 00:39:16,662
You have to go without me.

661
00:39:16,664 --> 00:39:20,633
I'm staying with you.

662
00:39:47,194 --> 00:39:48,294
Yeah. Carter.

663
00:39:48,296 --> 00:39:50,379
You been asking a lot
of questions about me.

664
00:39:50,381 --> 00:39:52,464
It's time we sat down
face to face.

665
00:39:52,466 --> 00:39:53,632
Who is this?

666
00:39:53,634 --> 00:39:57,086
You know who.
You want to meet me or not?

667
00:39:57,088 --> 00:39:59,538
Go.

668
00:40:09,766 --> 00:40:11,183
Wait for my signal.

669
00:40:11,185 --> 00:40:13,051
Be careful.

670
00:40:13,053 --> 00:40:16,105
This guy's as dangerous
as they get.

671
00:40:47,086 --> 00:40:49,555
Sweetheart?
What are you doing here?

672
00:40:49,557 --> 00:40:50,940
Are you detective Carter?

673
00:40:50,942 --> 00:40:52,391
Yes.

674
00:40:52,393 --> 00:40:55,110
My friend said
I could trust you.

675
00:41:18,718 --> 00:41:21,637
Watch your head,
Mr. Calhoun.

676
00:41:21,639 --> 00:41:23,422
So you can't tell me anything

677
00:41:23,424 --> 00:41:27,459
about how this man looks?

678
00:41:27,461 --> 00:41:29,762
Hotel staff said
they might have seen

679
00:41:29,764 --> 00:41:31,513
two people coming and going,

680
00:41:31,515 --> 00:41:36,435
but it's nothing on
the surveillance cameras.

681
00:41:36,437 --> 00:41:40,773
Was there anyone else
helping you?

682
00:41:40,775 --> 00:41:45,194
It was a pretty
traumatic experience.

683
00:41:45,196 --> 00:41:47,780
I don't remember much at all.

684
00:41:53,821 --> 00:42:01,627
♪ ♪

685
00:42:08,301 --> 00:42:11,186
Theresa.

686
00:42:11,188 --> 00:42:13,555
Oh.

687
00:42:30,991 --> 00:42:33,459
Are you looking for Harold?

688
00:42:33,461 --> 00:42:36,045
Is he taking
another personal day?

689
00:42:36,047 --> 00:42:39,832
I don't think so.
I was hoping you knew.

690
00:42:39,834 --> 00:42:41,417
Maggie said
he'd been transferred,

691
00:42:41,419 --> 00:42:42,918
but Dave said he was laid off.

692
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:45,587
He didn't even say goodbye.

693
00:42:49,593 --> 00:42:51,060
And here I was thinking

694
00:42:51,062 --> 00:42:53,479
we were getting
a little closer, Harold.

695
00:42:53,481 --> 00:42:55,514
I told you I'm
a very private person.

696
00:42:55,516 --> 00:42:57,883
Well, you're gonna need
to trust someone at some point.

697
00:42:57,885 --> 00:43:01,854
Trust? That's not something
I come by very easily.

698
00:43:01,856 --> 00:43:03,305
I have my reasons.

699
00:43:03,307 --> 00:43:07,710
Are you ever gonna
tell me those reasons?

700
00:43:07,712 --> 00:43:10,195
Don't call me,
Mr. Reese.

701
00:43:10,197 --> 00:43:13,449
I'll call you.

702
