1
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:03,320
You are being watched.

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:06,220
The government has a secret system--

3
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:09,750
a machine that spies on you every hour of every day.

4
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:12,680
I know because... I built it.

5
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:15,690
I designed the machine to detect acts of terror

6
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:16,860
but it sees everything--

7
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:19,760
Violent crimes involving ordinary people.

8
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:20,810
People like you.

9
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,840
Crimes the government considered irrelevant.

10
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,680
They wouldn't act, so I decided I would.

11
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,940
But I needed a partner.

12
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:32,690
Someone with the skills to intervene.

13
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:37,050
Hunted by the authorities, we work in secret.

14
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:38,650
You will never find us.

15
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:42,820
But victim or perpetrator, if your number's up,

16
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:44,130
we'll find you.

17
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:55,000
The call came in. We have a location on the target.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,490
Get a team, and I'll meet you there.

19
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,900
We can handle this.

20
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:00,820
No. I want to be there in person.

21
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:03,100
I want to kill him myself.

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,074
Who are the real-world Illuminati ?
Find out @ saveanilluminati.com

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,870
Wait. Can you rewind that for me?

24
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:22,550
I thought I was all done mopping up bodega shootings

25
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,630
when I joined the homicide task force.

26
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,150
This looks like a stickup job to you?

27
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:28,590
Then maybe you need to go back to working a precinct.

28
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:31,150
There was no money taken.

29
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:34,180
Double tap, close range-- this was an execution.

30
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,560
We got any I.D. on the vic?

31
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,200
Not yet, but you haven't seen the best part.

32
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,660
Rewind it again.

33
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:44,830
We got ourselves a witness.

34
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:47,060
- Any sign of him? - I put out a bolo.

35
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:49,310
Had a team canvass a six-block radius.

36
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:50,300
Guy vanished.

37
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,710
I'd make myself scarce too.

38
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,940
This ain't no neighborhood you want to be called a snitch.

39
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,380
- No, it's not. - Detective...

40
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:58,190
Got a bunch of reporters out there begging me for scraps.

41
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,380
What do I tell them?

42
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:01,240
Send them to the task force P.R. guy.

43
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,710
- Let him deal with them. - Yes, ma'am.

44
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:05,340
Detective Szymanski, organized crime,

45
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,350
- This is detective Fusco. - Nice to meet you.

46
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:08,850
Was this a mob hit?

47
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:11,120
The victim's a former "la cosa nostra" lieutenant

48
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,230
By the name of Benny d'Agostino.

49
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,890
He was out of the game for a couple of years,

50
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:17,990
and then he popped up again on our radar about six months ago.

51
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:19,590
Brighton beach is Russian territory.

52
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:21,060
So what's the l.C.N. doing here?

53
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,190
You kidding? There's a war going on.

54
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,060
Half a dozen V.I.P.S. in the Russian mob

55
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,230
were taken out last month.

56
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:28,630
Word is Benny's boss ordered the hits.

57
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:31,000
- This was retribution. - So who's his boss?

58
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
We don't know much...

59
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,290
Other than a name-- Elias.

60
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:37,640
You heard of him?

61
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,380
Oh, yeah. We go way back.

62
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:41,280
One of his guys took a shot at me last week.

63
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,380
This Elias is a clever bastard.

64
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:45,080
Nobody even knows what he looks like.

65
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,080
What about the witness?

66
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:47,650
Your boys have any luck finding him?

67
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:50,470
No, but have another look at the surveillance footage.

68
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:57,900
The victim said something to the witness.

69
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,530
If it's a dying declaration and he named the killers,

70
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:01,530
it'd be admissible.

71
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:03,800
Yeah, but we've got a problem.

72
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,070
The Russian owner of this fine establishment

73
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:08,770
was on a conveniently timed smoke break

74
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:10,410
when all this went down.

75
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:11,740
He's not giving us anything.

76
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:13,950
You think he told the shooters we found a witness?

77
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:15,710
If he did, the Russians will knock down every door

78
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,750
in this neighborhood till they find him.

79
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,380
Well, my guys are working the block.

80
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:21,790
- Something will pop. - It better.

81
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:25,300
We got to get to this witness before the Russians do.

82
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:32,260
I received his number late last night.

83
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:34,500
His name is Charlie Burton.

84
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,350
The guy is worried about something.

85
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:38,600
I'm not seeing a threat yet.

86
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,670
What's his story, Finch?

87
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:42,270
He's a high-school history teacher

88
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:43,640
working in the Brighton Beach school district.

89
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,980
Lives alone, never married--

90
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,150
not much to go on.

91
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:49,650
Well, maybe a student's after him.

92
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:52,080
You know, teaching can be a dangerous profession.

93
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,790
Yes, I imagine espionage was a much safer choice,

94
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:56,570
Mr. Reese.

95
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,260
Hello, Lionel.

96
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,960
I'm not sure how you usually do what you do,

97
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:08,530
But I'm looking for a guy, and I could use some help.

98
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:10,970
He's a witness, saw a Russian mob hit go down.

99
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:14,270
He's caucasian, 5'10", bald.

100
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:16,410
Probably not the most popular guy in his class,

101
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:17,480
If you know what I mean.

102
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,760
We need to find him.

103
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,450
I think I already did.

104
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:23,150
Why am I not surprised?

105
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:25,580
Listen, whoever did this hit,

106
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:28,170
They're gonna come looking for him.

107
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:32,460
They've already found him.

108
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,160
Mr. Reese...

109
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,330
We might want to leave this one to the authorities.

110
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:38,680
No time. I'm heading in.

111
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,640
Cover the exits.

112
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,290
The rest of you come with me.

113
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:13,830
Get out of my apartment.

114
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,850
Mr. Burton, you're in danger.

115
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,940
The men from the bodega are here.

116
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,870
Now, how do you know about that? Did they send you?

117
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,940
Sir, you have a Russian hit team closing in,

118
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:24,410
Which leaves us with approximately five seconds

119
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:26,240
before you need to make a decision.

120
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,580
How do I know you're not one of them?

121
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:29,380
Because I'm standing in front of you

122
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:31,210
And you're still alive.

123
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:35,630
Doesn't seem like I've got a choice.

124
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,480
Where did this piece of garbage go?

125
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,960
I'll double back.

126
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:03,210
Mr. Reese, can you get out?

127
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:05,450
Do you need me to call in a distraction?

128
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:07,660
Let me get back to you on that. Come on.

129
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:27,630
Let's get moving...

130
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,290
Now.

131
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:38,280
Okay, the fastest way out of this neighborhood

132
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,680
is through those buildings.

133
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,090
What, are you joking?

134
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:43,150
Even the Russians don't go into the Double "B"s.

135
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,020
A bulgarian drug dealer runs the place.

136
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:49,840
Okay, Finch, I'm gonna need another route out of here.

137
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,300
We're on our own. I need your cell phone.

138
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,750
I don't believe in them.

139
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:00,750
Mr. Reese, can you hear me?

140
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:12,620
Hey, this isn't mine!

141
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:15,370
Not mine either. Get in.

142
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:19,920
May I at least have your name

143
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:21,660
Before we commit grand theft auto together?

144
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,230
First, we need to get you to the police,

145
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:25,360
So you can tell them about what you saw at the bodega.

146
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,760
The Russian mob is after me, friend.

147
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:28,170
They've got people on the inside.

148
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:29,670
If I testify, I'm dead.

149
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:31,700
I know a detective we can trust.

150
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,940
But we need to get you across the river to Manhattan.

151
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,720
Get down!

152
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:46,320
We need to keep moving.

153
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,050
That's going to be a problem.

154
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,550
You say the Russians don't go in there?

155
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,500
Well, that's where we're going.

156
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,880
See what I mean?

157
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:58,110
This is crazy.

158
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,630
I still don't even know who you are.

159
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:03,000
I help people.

160
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,430
And you need help.

161
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,070
Well...

162
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:10,210
Bullet went straight through clean--

163
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:13,040
No bone damage.

164
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,780
But we need to get you cleaned up before it gets infected.

165
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,170
You see a pharmacy nearby?

166
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,790
The men you saw last night at the bodega...

167
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:24,170
what can you tell me about them?

168
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:30,450
What difference does it make?

169
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,520
I guess I like to know a little bit about the guys

170
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,670
who are shooting at me.

171
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:40,000
I worked through dinner, and I was grading papers.

172
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,370
And I stopped at the store on my way home.

173
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:47,220
I couldn't decide between minestrone and split pea.

174
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:52,510
And then I saw the guys with guns, and I hid.

175
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:53,950
Did you see their faces?

176
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:56,830
They had masks.

177
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,320
But one of them lifted his,

178
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,580
like he wanted that guy to see his face.

179
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:02,950
But that guy they killed...

180
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,890
He said he had a message for someone named Elias.

181
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:08,830
And he wanted me to give it to him, but I don't know an Elias.

182
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:10,470
I tried to tell him that.

183
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:17,800
Mr. Burton, what was the message?

184
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:21,440
I didn't understand it-- something about Vinnie.

185
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,050
Vinnie was gonna finish the job for him.

186
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:25,970
Why didn't you call the police?

187
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,640
You don't understand this neighborhood, do you?

188
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:31,950
Going to the cops here is like playing Russian roulette.

189
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:35,120
You don't know which side they're on.

190
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,520
One of my students' parents filed a police report last year.

191
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:41,160
Then he got into an accident.

192
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,860
He's still eating through a straw.

193
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:46,160
I'll get you to a police officer you can trust.

194
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,730
I'm gonna keep my mouth shut

195
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:52,030
and hope it all blows over.

196
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:54,700
I don't know. These guys look pretty upset.

197
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,870
If I testify...

198
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:59,870
I never get to come back here.

199
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,570
And I've worked too hard.

200
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:05,190
This is my home.

201
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:09,180
My students, for starters-- I-I can't leave them.

202
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,380
They need me.

203
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:12,690
Well, you won't do those kids any good

204
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:14,530
if you're dead, Mr. Burton.

205
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,960
Charlie, please-- "Mr. Burton" Is for my students.

206
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,430
Do you want to die, Charlie?

207
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,600
Because this isn't a history lesson.

208
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,080
Those bullets are real.

209
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:33,050
My name is John.

210
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,690
Thank you for saving my ass, John.

211
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,810
Thanks for coming down, Patti.

212
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:54,400
We're all very sorry for your loss.

213
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,530
You're not sorry. You hated my husband.

214
00:11:57,530 --> 00:11:59,770
No, I only hated what he did for a living.

215
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:01,400
Ma'am...

216
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:05,110
Do you know why Benny was in Brighton Beach last night?

217
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:07,620
Was he--I don't know-- conducting business?

218
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:11,950
Mrs. D'agostino...

219
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:15,220
I know that anger you're feeling right now--

220
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:18,620
What it's like to lose someone you love.

221
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:21,560
Help us find the men who did this to your husband.

222
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:24,690
It doesn't matter if you find them.

223
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:26,590
Elias will.

224
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:30,660
And he'll kill each and every single one of those russian bastards.

225
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:34,600
Elias started a war that can't be won.

226
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,770
Now, a lot of innocent people are gonna die if this continues.

227
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:40,610
- Do you want that? - If that's what it takes.

228
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:44,150
Where is he, Patti?

229
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:46,850
Where is Elias?

230
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:48,880
I never met him.

231
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,650
And his crew... they don't socialize.

232
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:55,420
That's why you'll never find him.

233
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,560
I'm a little confused.

234
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,430
Why does Elias want Brighton Beach so bad?

235
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:01,800
You're not seeing it.

236
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,330
Brighton Beach is just the beginning.

237
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:06,200
Elias has bigger plans.

238
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,370
He'll reunite the five families

239
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:11,710
and take out the Russian trash.

240
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:14,010
And then when he's finished,

241
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:17,860
you people will be answering to him.

242
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,200
Five or six heavily armed men were chasing a guy

243
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,530
matching the description of our witness.

244
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:12,900
His name's Charlie Burton, by the way.

245
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:16,600
Found out he had groceries delivered twice a month from the bodega,

246
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:18,770
And he wasn't dodging bullets by himself.

247
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:21,240
- Who was he with? - Some tall guy in a suit--

248
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,610
Definitely not with the Russians.

249
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:25,510
Shot one of them in the knee before they got away.

250
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:27,050
What? You know him?

251
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:29,580
It's just someone I've been tracking for a while.

252
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:31,620
Best I've got, he's former military--

253
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,950
a pain in the ass.

254
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:34,120
Either one of them get hit?

255
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,690
There seems to be an awful lot of shots fired.

256
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:37,260
Looks like they got off okay.

257
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:39,230
I got a russian thug in the hospital who isn't talking,

258
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:41,430
But we got an ATM camera across the street.

259
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:43,700
That might help shed some light on things.

260
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,900
It'll take two weeks and a warrant to get the footage.

261
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:48,580
Thankfully, a bystander got some footage of her own.

262
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,140
Meet Peter Yogorov.

263
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,440
As in Ivan Yogorov, the Russian boss?

264
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,610
Peter's his son.

265
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:56,840
- Yo, officer. - Yeah.

266
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:58,280
Call over to the 8th.

267
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:02,420
Tell them to pull any file we have pertaining to Ivan Yogorov.

268
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:04,080
Ivan Yogorov-- got it.

269
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:22,250
Where are you, Mr. Reese?

270
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,780
Who are these guys?

271
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:53,260
And what's this cop doing with them?

272
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:01,090
N.Y.P.D.

273
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,750
-Detective Fusco. - Hello, Detective.

274
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:14,190
I need to talk to you about our mutual friend.

275
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:15,920
Who's this?

276
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,520
And who the hell is our mutual friend?

277
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:22,600
I seem to recall you were going to take him to oyster bay once upon a time.

278
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,760
So you're his guy?

279
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:25,830
No, Detective. I think that's your role.

280
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:28,140
I've lost contact with him.

281
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:30,270
Do you have any idea where he and the witness are now?

282
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:31,840
Yeah, somewhere in Brighton Beach.

283
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,610
The Russians opened fire on them in broad daylight.

284
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:37,140
Those two are going nowhere fast with this type of heat on them.

285
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:38,710
Unfortunately, the Russian mafia

286
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:40,210
May not be our only problem.

287
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:42,320
I need you to run a license plate for me.

288
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,620
Yeah, sure, pal. I'll help you out...

289
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,690
If you can tell me what the hell it is I'm doing.

290
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:50,160
It relates to your case. That's all you need to know.

291
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,930
"Tnf0818."

292
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,730
If I hear anything about our friend,

293
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:56,900
How do I get in touch with you?

294
00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:00,270
You don't. I'll find you, detective.

295
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:01,900
I'm telling you, I winged the guy.

296
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,400
Let's get in there and finish him off.

297
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:06,070
Laszlo, wait up. We need to call papa, regroup.

298
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:08,080
You want to wait around out here?

299
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,410
Fine. I'm going in.

300
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:12,150
You want to go at it with a bunch of Bulgarian tweakers?

301
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:13,450
We made a deal--

302
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:16,430
They stay out of our territory. We stay out of theirs.

303
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,750
Cover every exit.

304
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:24,540
No way those two get out without going past us first.

305
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:32,270
I need you to stay awake, charlie.

306
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:35,510
I don't want you to go into shock.

307
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:44,410
So how did you wind up doing whatever it is you do, john?

308
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:47,730
It's... Complicated.

309
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,430
What about you?

310
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:54,090
Did you always want to be a teacher?

311
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:57,470
No, it was sort of a career shift.

312
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:01,330
I came to like the kids a lot.

313
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,860
A lot of their parents are affiliated with the russian mob,

314
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:06,900
So I try to give them other options.

315
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,980
They're lucky to have you.

316
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:14,410
Only the ones that I get out of the life and into college.

317
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:17,240
What about the kids who don't make it?

318
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,630
Probably the ones shooting at us.

319
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:25,690
Don't go anywhere.

320
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:28,760
What? Wait. Where--where are you going?

321
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,340
To find us a pharmacy.

322
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,510
You should be careful

323
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:47,010
About your cholesterol intake, detective.

324
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:48,220
What, are we dating?

325
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:52,610
Do you have the information I asked you for?

326
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:53,910
You're the boss, huh?

327
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,730
The voice on the other end of the phone?

328
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:58,820
The plate's registered to a shell corp in midtown.

329
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,290
It's a dead end.

330
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,420
Hey, let me ask you something.

331
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:05,790
Who are you trying to track down, "Mr. Friend of a friend"?

332
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:08,160
The russians aren't the only criminal operation

333
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,530
Looking for charlie burton.

334
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:10,900
You saying this plate belongs to Elias?

335
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,330
Maybe. You mentioned in your report

336
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:15,900
That the victim spoke to mr. Burton before he expired.

337
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,400
Whoa. What do you mean? You read my report?

338
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:19,470
- How did you read my report? - doesn't matter, mr. Fusco.

339
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:23,380
What matters is that whatever message benny was passing along,

340
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:25,590
It means a great deal to elias.

341
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:28,250
so you're telling me the russians want

342
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,630
The poor bastard dead because he witnessed them taking out benny.

343
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:31,720
And elias wants him dead

344
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,700
Because he thinks he has sensitive information.

345
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:36,820
- Not his lucky day, is it? - indeed.

346
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:39,590
That car-- I need you to report it stolen,

347
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:42,650
Then email the report number to that address.

348
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:46,470
Hey, you heard from our mutual friend?

349
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:48,900
What, are you worried about him, detective?

350
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,400
Let's go with curious.

351
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:51,720
No.

352
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:54,270
No word from him.

353
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:02,350
I made almost twice what I did yesterday.

354
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:03,880
You still ain't made more than me.

355
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:07,630
Hello, fellas. Can I borrow some of your drugs?

356
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:13,730
oh, no. Easy, fella. I'm not looking for a fight.

357
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:16,380
Looks like you found one anyway.

358
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:23,940
Don't do it.

359
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,950
I'm telling you, now.

360
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,570
Thank you.

361
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:53,610
If ivan's sons are involved in this,

362
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:56,210
Could be the man himself was at the bodega--

363
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,850
Avenge his brother's death in person.

364
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:01,280
Elias' crew took him out last week,

365
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,520
Along with a half a dozen other russian hitters.

366
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,960
I thought the russians were untouchable in brighton beach.

367
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:09,530
They were. No one knows where elias gets his information.

368
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:11,860
He's always one step ahead of all of them...and us.

369
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:14,700
What I still don't get is why elias

370
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,980
Is trying to make a move for brighton beach.

371
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:23,070
A woman named Marlene Elias was murdered in 1973.

372
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:25,340
She had an illegitimate son with Don Moretti.

373
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:28,690
I think Elias is the Don's kid.

374
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,650
Last place Moretti ran

375
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:34,680
Before he got locked up was Brighton Beach.

376
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:37,450
So the Don's bastard son came back to clean up?

377
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:39,630
Claim his birthright?

378
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:47,300
What is that?

379
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:50,530
Cocaine.

380
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:53,050
I guess there's a first time for everything.

381
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:56,610
Is that glue?

382
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:58,540
Yeah.

383
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:00,310
Nothing like over-the-counter polymer

384
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:01,940
To close a wound in a pinch.

385
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:04,280
You learn all this in hero training?

386
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,920
Something like that.

387
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,960
Thank you.

388
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:14,320
Sure.

389
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,730
No, really...

390
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:19,060
Thank you.

391
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:22,310
If it wasn't for you, I'd be dead right now.

392
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:31,670
You ever use one of these?

393
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:34,240
Don't you think it would be better if you kept it?

394
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,350
Well, just in case.

395
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:38,480
No, last time I touched a gun, I shot cans

396
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,880
With one of my foster dads...

397
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,050
Accidentally killed a bird--

398
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:43,990
Not my favorite childhood memory.

399
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:46,320
Simple. Look...

400
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:50,230
Safety's there. Just load the magazine like this.

401
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:53,570
Rack it. Simple.

402
00:22:58,030 --> 00:23:00,300
Do you really think we'll get out of here?

403
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:02,240
We have a hell of a lot better chance

404
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,690
Than we did 20 minutes ago.

405
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,090
Here they come.

406
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:15,220
You after those boys running around our building?

407
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,620
That's right.

408
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:19,560
He took something from my people.

409
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:22,120
We don't give you any problems, you take 'em out?

410
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:25,070
I can make that deal.

411
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:32,370
Give one to the other guy.

412
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:33,970
We'll help you out a whole lot quicker.

413
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:36,410
Someone told me they're hiding out on the fourth floor.

414
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:40,050
And one of them's already bleeding.

415
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,020
Put this on.

416
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:56,490
If I can find a line that's still operating,

417
00:23:56,490 --> 00:23:59,240
We can make a call.

418
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:08,170
Wow, I thought I was the only one who still had a hard line.

419
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:10,210
I was hoping there was someone in this building

420
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:14,010
As old-fashioned as you, Charlie.

421
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:16,410
I'm sorry I got you into this mess.

422
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:19,720
It's okay. It's my job.

423
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,720
It's a dangerous career choice.

424
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,590
That's the second time today I've heard that.

425
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:31,170
It's funny. You remind me of him.

426
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:49,080
Finch... I was just talking about you.

427
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,630
Where are you, Mr. Reese?

428
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:54,780
The double "B" Housing projects--

429
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:57,490
Fourth floor, north tower.

430
00:24:57,490 --> 00:24:59,120
Find me a way out of here, Finch--

431
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,620
One that no one else will use.

432
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:04,140
City planning office should have old blueprints.

433
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:07,560
How is Mr. Burton faring?

434
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:10,510
He's wounded but stubborn.

435
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:12,330
He'll pull through.

436
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:15,070
The Russians aren't the only ones after him.

437
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:19,010
I think Elias is looking for him too.

438
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:20,340
Two service entrances--

439
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:24,130
The one closest to you is in the northeast corridor.

440
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:29,790
- Can you make it there?  - We've got no choice.

441
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:32,920
Tell Fusco to meet us at pier 11 at 7:00 A.M.

442
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,160
We'll be on the East River Ferry.

443
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,760
Be careful, Mr. Reese.

444
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,810
Come on.

445
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:45,470
Service stairs should be around the next corridor.

446
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:48,800
Keep your eyes open. They could be anywhere.

447
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:51,110
Hey, I think they went this way.

448
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:54,390
- What now? - Wait here.

449
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:58,230
Who's there?

450
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:06,070
Check down that way.

451
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:11,990
- Mr. Burton?  - Will?

452
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,530
What are you doing?

453
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:16,830
Hey, Will.

454
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:19,900
Came in looking for a shortcut, and we just, uh...

455
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:22,340
This is my friend, by the way.

456
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:23,710
We just got lost.

457
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:25,740
Check the south side.

458
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:28,610
Come on. My dad's not home.

459
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:31,490
You can hide in here.

460
00:26:58,170 --> 00:26:59,940
Vehicle Recovery Services.

461
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:03,750
Yeah, this is Detective Fusco, shield number 7645.

462
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:06,880
I'm trying to turn on the locator in a stolen vehicle.

463
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,490
Uh, report number is...

464
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:11,990
Lima 377.

465
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:14,820
Thank you, Detective. How can I help you?

466
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:18,130
Yeah, could you turn on the car's G.P.S. Locator

467
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:19,530
And the microphone?

468
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:22,080
Of course. Bear with me, please.

469
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,540
I thought you and your dad moved out of here.

470
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:32,450
Not yet. He said we will as soon as he gets a job.

471
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,940
Yeah, times are tough right now.

472
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:36,850
I'm sure he'll get one soon.

473
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:40,060
Just don't move out of my school district, okay?

474
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:45,500
- You did your homework? - Yep. All of it.

475
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,090
- What did you think? - Edmond's cool--

476
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:51,960
A survivor, you know?

477
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,230
Even though he got his revenge,

478
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:54,680
Some bad stuff still stuck with him.

479
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:57,470
Yeah, you're a smart kid, Will.

480
00:27:57,470 --> 00:28:00,140
You just need to show up to class more.

481
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:01,340
I'm trying.

482
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:03,650
That's all any of us can do, right?

483
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:07,310
Zombies?

484
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,570
They're taking over the universe.

485
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:10,890
Yeah, can't have that.

486
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:29,610
Who are you?

487
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,380
You're that cop.

488
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,270
Word is the Russians are inside the double "B"s.

489
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:42,920
We better get to them first.

490
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:01,670
Is that you, Elias?

491
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,450
Open up, or we're coming in.

492
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:36,450
What do you want?

493
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:38,720
Hey, little man. You all alone in there?

494
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,120
What's it look like?

495
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:44,320
Why don't you let me in, so I can make sure?

496
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,090
My papa taught me better

497
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:48,260
Than to let strangers inside our place,

498
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:49,970
Especially punks.

499
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:55,120
- Is that right? - That's right.

500
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,240
He also said that vory are supposed to show respect

501
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,570
To one another.

502
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:03,750
Your papa's a smart man.

503
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,500
You be good, kid.

504
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,820
Thanks, Will.

505
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:19,100
It's all good, Mr. Burton.

506
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,590
You're the best teacher I've got.

507
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:26,930
Charlie...

508
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:30,710
Can you make it to the service stairs?

509
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:35,010
I'll try, but the painkiller sort of wore off.

510
00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:37,180
Why don't you just use the old entrance?

511
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:39,010
They closed it down a few years ago.

512
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:41,250
- The stairs got all rotted. - Where is it?

513
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:43,350
It's--it's down the hall.

514
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:44,990
It's back the way that you came.

515
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:48,240
Thanks.

516
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:49,380
Come on.

517
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:57,430
I owe you one.

518
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:59,570
I'll see you tomorrow, Mr. Burton.

519
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:01,540
Yeah. Yeah, we'll see you tomorrow.

520
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:03,690
You... did you guys get that hallway?

521
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:05,140
Let's go.

522
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:20,970
Open up, or we're coming in.

523
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,560
Hello?

524
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,270
Anyone home?

525
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,870
Can't hide forever.

526
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,890
Wherever you are, we're gonna find you.

527
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,720
And then we're gonna end you.

528
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:41,360
Come on. Let's keep moving.

529
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:00,390
Looks like you got left behind.

530
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,470
How can I help

531
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:07,370
The New York City Police Department tonight?

532
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:08,880
Your son Peter's wanted for questioning

533
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,940
In the murder of Benny D'Agostino.

534
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:12,650
Know where we might find him?

535
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:15,120
- Who is this Benny? - Come on, Ivan.

536
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,820
We heard Benny was the trigger man

537
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:18,150
In your brother's murder.

538
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:19,790
And we know the Bodega run was payback.

539
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:20,990
You seem to know a lot

540
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:24,160
For someone who is here to ask me questions.

541
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:27,360
Mr. Yogorov, we don't want any more bloodshed.

542
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,900
My Peter was here working all day long.

543
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:33,630
He's at the storage getting more wine

544
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:36,640
For an event tonight.

545
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,570
With all due respect, Sir,

546
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:42,510
You may not be the best person to give your son an alibi.

547
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:45,380
If you are here to accuse my Peter of something,

548
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:48,250
I suggest you come back with a warrant...

549
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:50,050
If you can get one.

550
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:52,450
There are no winners in this war, Ivan--

551
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:54,350
Only dead soldiers.

552
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:57,270
Are you ready to lose your sons too?

553
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:00,830
If I knew to what you were referring,

554
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:03,200
I'd say that this so-called war

555
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,430
Was started by this coward Elias, not me.

556
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:09,200
He's the one who comes to my neighborhood...

557
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:13,610
Stealing from me, killing my people...

558
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:16,220
Not the other way around.

559
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:21,730
Now, if you excuse me, I have an event to host.

560
00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:26,900
Please.

561
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,000
Mind if I borrow this for a moment?

562
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,850
Screw you.

563
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:45,040
It's a bad move to insult your hostage taker, Laszlo.

564
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:47,870
Keep your mouth shut, or I'll shut it permanently.

565
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:50,480
Let's go.

566
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,510
Finch, it's me.

567
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:54,780
Get word to Carter that her bodega shooters

568
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:56,480
are inside the Double"B"s.

569
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,230
Of course.

570
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,120
And I'll make sure detective Fusco meets you

571
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,300
And the witness at the ferry.

572
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,510
You first.

573
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:21,980
- Where are we going now? - Across the river.

574
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:25,060
Come on, Laszlo, let's move.

575
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:29,550
Just got a text. He's heading to pier 11.

576
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:32,110
Let's get over there to intercept him, now.

577
00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:43,330
- Nice collar, detective. - You too, Carter.

578
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:47,350
- You find out who called it in? - I have an idea.

579
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:01,780
Yeah. Fusco.

580
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:03,350
And I was just starting to believe

581
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:04,790
That we could trust you, detective.

582
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:06,190
I'm disappointed.

583
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:07,620
What are you talking about?

584
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:08,960
Elias' men are on their way

585
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,620
To meet our friends at the ferry.

586
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:13,690
- How the hell'd they find out? - I was going to ask you.

587
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:16,130
- You're blaming me for this? - Then who told them?

588
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:18,900
Listen, there's no way I would've--

589
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:22,720
Detective, are you there?

590
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:38,510
When we get you across the river,

591
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:40,980
I'm going to hand you off to my detective.

592
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:42,930
Now, you can trust him.

593
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:46,060
Charlie, I need you to testify.

594
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,290
One thing I know for sure--

595
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:51,550
After everything we went through last night,

596
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,790
I don't want to see these cretins running around my town

597
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,760
Ever again.

598
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:03,160
Thanks.

599
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:07,170
Ready to talk?

600
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:09,020
You ready to let me go?

601
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,650
Peter, we got you on camera.

602
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,980
We've got witnesses that say

603
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:16,210
You and your brother were shooting up the streets

604
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:17,460
In brighton beach.

605
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:21,500
No idea what you're talking about.

606
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:25,620
It's a beautiful morning.

607
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:28,990
I have to thank you, John.

608
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:30,610
To tell you the truth,

609
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:31,910
I didn't think I'd see another one.

610
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:35,730
Elias killed your uncle.

611
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:37,480
You, your father, and your brother

612
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,490
Went to the bodega for revenge.

613
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:41,440
You didn't know what Elias looked like,

614
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,840
So his lieutenant Benny D'agostino

615
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:46,140
Was the next best thing.

616
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:49,180
And now you're trying to rub out the witness--

617
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:52,690
The guy who saw your father's face.

618
00:36:56,050 --> 00:36:57,890
We heard from a source

619
00:36:57,890 --> 00:36:59,590
That Elias was supposed to be at the bodega

620
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:01,560
- That night. - he was meeting Benny.

621
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,630
Yeah.

622
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:04,390
But when we showed up...

623
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,100
Benny was all we saw.

624
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:09,730
Found out what really went down after the owner called us.

625
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:11,110
He said there was another guy.

626
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,990
Hey, what are you--

627
00:37:15,290 --> 00:37:16,740
Corrupt P.D.,

628
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:18,240
Gun for hire?

629
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,580
What kind of guy takes money

630
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:21,290
To protect a scumbag like your boss here?

631
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:24,280
You think he's going to testify...

632
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,930
After everything he's done?

633
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:28,750
He's tearing this town apart.

634
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:32,600
What are you talking about?

635
00:37:34,610 --> 00:37:37,240
You don't know who he is, do you...

636
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:39,480
What he's capable of?

637
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,640
You don't really get it, do you?

638
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:46,840
You honestly think we'd go to all this trouble

639
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:47,690
For a witness?

640
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,310
You're in the middle of a situation

641
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:58,190
That you don't even understand.

642
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:02,260
Don't make me shoot you, John.

643
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:06,630
Drop your weapon and kick it to me, please.

644
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:17,870
I thought you didn't like guns.

645
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:20,800
You know, sometimes you have to do things you don't like.

646
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:24,140
Like teaching history to the children of your enemies?

647
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:26,110
Three years, I watched them--

648
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:29,410
Cleaning up after the children of those pigs.

649
00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:31,010
It's a good amount of time to learn

650
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:33,490
What makes your enemies tick, what makes them weak.

651
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:37,720
You know all the secrets you and your family tried to hide,

652
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:40,290
Laszlo, I learned all about from your own flesh and blood?

653
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:43,470
Your children hate you almost as much as I do.

654
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,160
Tie yourself to the railing, John,

655
00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:49,530
Nice and tight.

656
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:50,700
I know how capable you are

657
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,870
Of getting out of difficult situations.

658
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:54,000
On your knees, please.

659
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:57,970
You were meeting Benny at the bodega that day,

660
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:59,070
Weren't you?

661
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:02,050
The shooters were looking for you.

662
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:04,280
Yeah, the benefits of no one knowing who you are

663
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,690
Or what you look like.

664
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,850
That's gone now, I suppose.

665
00:39:07,850 --> 00:39:09,710
It's time to evolve.

666
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:12,200
I'm ready for the next step.

667
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,230
Go ahead.

668
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:19,330
I'd rather die than see you running my city.

669
00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:21,560
You know what Benny said before he died?

670
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:23,330
He said, "Veni, vidi, vici"--

671
00:39:23,330 --> 00:39:25,100
I came, I saw, I won.

672
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:28,290
He said your almighty Bratva was already crumbling.

673
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:31,340
He said we'd already won.

674
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:33,680
This is for Benny.

675
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,450
Elias, if you kill him...

676
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:39,080
I'm not going to kill him. -

677
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:41,420
I'm just going to send a message.

678
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:45,250
You tell your papa, Laszlo, if he gets out of town tonight,

679
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:47,120
I'll let him live.

680
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:49,400
Brighton beach belongs to me now.

681
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:56,100
I thought about killing you, John.

682
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:58,470
But I realize that that would seem ungrateful.

683
00:39:58,470 --> 00:40:01,900
Besides, how do you take the life of someone so talented?

684
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:05,190
I could really use a guy like you in my organization.

685
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:10,010
I wish you luck, John.

686
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:12,480
If you stay out of my way, I'll stay out of yours.

687
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,200
What if I don't?

688
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:21,300
Then we'll meet again under less pleasant circumstances.

689
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,960
You believe me now?

690
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:59,360
I'm sorry, detective.

691
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:19,180
Nice to see you, Lionel.

692
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:21,150
Your suspect is tied to the railing.

693
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:23,110
Tell him "You're welcome."

694
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:29,000
Couldn't have known about Charlie.

695
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:33,130
The machine found a man who was targeted for death.

696
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:36,010
We just didn't know that he was also a killer.

697
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:38,630
It's my fault he's out there, Finch.

698
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,080
It's not yours alone.

699
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:42,210
We just saved a man

700
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:44,540
Whose only goal in life is revenge.

701
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:46,610
He spent years studying his enemies

702
00:41:46,610 --> 00:41:48,210
Through their own children.

703
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:51,280
John, we have limited information.

704
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:55,030
We knew when we began this that we might make mistakes.

705
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:58,590
But we have to go now.

706
00:41:58,590 --> 00:42:00,660
We have more people to help-- more numbers.

707
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:02,590
and how many of those numbers will come up

708
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:04,420
Because we saved one man's life?

709
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:01,820
Boss...

710
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:03,920
It's done.

711
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,020
No, it's just beginning.

712
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:08,510
Veni, vidi, vici.

713
00:43:09,305 --> 00:44:09,563
