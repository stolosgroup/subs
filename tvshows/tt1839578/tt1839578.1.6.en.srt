1
00:00:01,018 --> 00:00:02,742
You are being watched.

2
00:00:03,943 --> 00:00:05,896
The government has
a secret system.

3
00:00:06,204 --> 00:00:09,675
A machine that spies on you
every hour of every day.

4
00:00:10,377 --> 00:00:12,623
I know because I built it.

5
00:00:13,157 --> 00:00:15,342
I designed the machine to
detect acts of terror

6
00:00:15,425 --> 00:00:17,000
but it sees everything.

7
00:00:17,319 --> 00:00:19,800
Violent crimes involving
ordinary people,

8
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:21,211
people like you.

9
00:00:21,501 --> 00:00:23,750
Crimes the government
considered irrelevant.

10
00:00:25,022 --> 00:00:28,373
They wouldn't act,
so I decided I would.

11
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:30,241
But I needed a partner--

12
00:00:30,243 --> 00:00:32,944
Someone with the skills
to intervene.

13
00:00:32,946 --> 00:00:37,449
Hunted by the authorities,
we work in secret.

14
00:00:37,451 --> 00:00:39,100
You will never find us.

15
00:00:39,102 --> 00:00:41,236
But victim or perpetrator,

16
00:00:41,238 --> 00:00:44,039
if you're number's up,
we'll find you.

18
00:00:50,246 --> 00:00:54,466
You know why I'm here.
You know how I feel.

19
00:00:54,468 --> 00:00:56,284
I can't hide it anymore.

20
00:00:56,286 --> 00:00:59,921
What we're doing is wrong.

21
00:01:05,728 --> 00:01:07,846
You're not my regular guy.

22
00:01:07,848 --> 00:01:09,014
He's sick.

23
00:01:09,016 --> 00:01:14,936
They called me to fill in
at the last moment.

24
00:01:14,938 --> 00:01:17,138
Callahan car service.

25
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:20,141
Zoe Morgan.
You changed my driver.

26
00:01:20,143 --> 00:01:21,659
Sorry for the inconvenience
Ms. Morgan,

27
00:01:21,661 --> 00:01:23,862
but Bill's come down
with laryngitis.

28
00:01:23,864 --> 00:01:26,031
Caught it from his son.

29
00:01:26,033 --> 00:01:27,482
Which son?

30
00:01:27,484 --> 00:01:29,117
Andy.
The younger one.

31
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,871
We sent our best driver
in his place.

32
00:01:32,873 --> 00:01:36,324
I'll be the judge of that.

33
00:01:36,326 --> 00:01:38,927
No small talk, no questions,

34
00:01:38,929 --> 00:01:40,128
just stay in the car,

35
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:45,100
and you keep
your eyes on the road.

36
00:01:45,102 --> 00:01:47,335
We'll settle up
at the end of the night.

37
00:01:47,337 --> 00:01:49,504
I look forward to it.

39
00:02:18,467 --> 00:02:21,219
Little trouble picking
this lock, Mr. Reese.

40
00:02:21,221 --> 00:02:23,254
It's not as easy as it looks.

41
00:02:23,256 --> 00:02:27,342
Never mind, I'm in.

42
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:37,102
No photos of family or friends.

43
00:02:39,822 --> 00:02:43,224
Some jazz records.

44
00:02:43,226 --> 00:02:47,061
She dropped out of law school,
no current employer.

45
00:02:47,063 --> 00:02:49,664
But she buys
a $2 million dollar apartment

46
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:51,116
for cash three years ago.

47
00:02:51,118 --> 00:02:54,419
What's she gotten
herself mixed up in?

48
00:03:12,377 --> 00:03:14,587
Where does she keep
the things she cares about?

49
00:03:15,524 --> 00:03:16,757
Where do you?

50
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:22,030
I don't have
any things I care about.

51
00:03:22,032 --> 00:03:22,981
Slip.

52
00:03:22,983 --> 00:03:25,483
Zoe.

53
00:03:25,485 --> 00:03:26,951
You got it?

54
00:03:26,953 --> 00:03:30,538
You know I always come
through for you, Zoe.

55
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,462
Be good, Slip.

56
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:46,787
She just paid for something.

57
00:03:46,789 --> 00:03:48,640
A lot of money.
Cash.

58
00:03:48,642 --> 00:03:49,641
Do you know what it is?

59
00:03:49,643 --> 00:03:50,925
No.

60
00:03:50,927 --> 00:03:53,645
Do you want to know where
people hide things, Finch?

61
00:03:53,647 --> 00:03:54,462
Underneath.

62
00:04:06,525 --> 00:04:08,526
Keep your eyes on the road.

63
00:04:28,264 --> 00:04:29,814
Uh-oh.

64
00:04:35,971 --> 00:04:39,190
Leave it running,
I won't be long.

65
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:43,645
Finch, the item
she bought was a gun.

66
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:48,032
But she's already got a gun
in her living room.

67
00:04:48,034 --> 00:04:49,317
Why does she need another one?

68
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:51,319
Well, the reason
you buy a gun off the street

69
00:04:51,321 --> 00:04:52,537
is so that it's untraceable.

70
00:04:52,539 --> 00:04:54,522
Possible her number came up

71
00:04:54,524 --> 00:04:57,242
because she plans
to kill someone.

72
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:11,539
♪ ♪

73
00:05:36,415 --> 00:05:37,949
Finch, she's a shooter.

74
00:05:37,951 --> 00:05:39,117
Target's a cop.

75
00:05:39,119 --> 00:05:42,570
Lieutenant Gilmore.

76
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,431
You owe me one.

77
00:05:53,433 --> 00:05:57,585
And so does the cop who left his
side arm in a subway bathroom.

78
00:05:57,587 --> 00:05:58,853
Believe me.
He knows.

79
00:05:58,855 --> 00:06:00,921
You saved a good cop's career.

80
00:06:00,923 --> 00:06:03,191
We need all the men
we can get right now.

81
00:06:03,193 --> 00:06:04,425
Mm-hmm.

82
00:06:04,427 --> 00:06:05,860
You sure this doesn't have
to do with the fact

83
00:06:05,862 --> 00:06:06,927
that he's your nephew?

84
00:06:06,929 --> 00:06:09,397
Either way, I'm grateful.

85
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:12,867
In a perfect world,
gratitude would be enough.

86
00:06:12,869 --> 00:06:16,037
That politically motivated investigation

87
00:06:16,039 --> 00:06:18,656
that you're running
into councilman rush?

88
00:06:18,658 --> 00:06:20,541
About time you wrap it up.

89
00:06:20,543 --> 00:06:21,942
Don't you think?

90
00:06:21,944 --> 00:06:27,448
Now I know where the term,
"necessary evil" comes from.

91
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:28,649
That makes us square?

92
00:06:28,651 --> 00:06:30,117
No,

93
00:06:30,119 --> 00:06:31,886
but it's a good start.

94
00:06:46,819 --> 00:06:48,469
See anything interesting
tonight?

95
00:06:48,471 --> 00:06:54,308
Nothing worth mentioning.

96
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:57,779
Be here tomorrow.
10:00 sharp.

97
00:07:04,787 --> 00:07:07,622
I hope you're out
of there, Finch.

98
00:07:07,624 --> 00:07:12,493
Do you know what she does, yet?

99
00:07:12,495 --> 00:07:15,797
She does favors for a price.

100
00:07:15,799 --> 00:07:18,182
She's a fixer.

101
00:07:18,184 --> 00:07:20,635
Assuming then that
she's the victim,

102
00:07:20,637 --> 00:07:23,137
any ideas who'd want
to take her out?

103
00:07:23,139 --> 00:07:25,606
Who wouldn't?

104
00:07:31,157 --> 00:07:33,442
What do you got, Terney?

105
00:07:33,444 --> 00:07:36,111
Vincent Deluca.

106
00:07:36,113 --> 00:07:38,914
71 years old,

107
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,866
public service homicide
if you ask me.

108
00:07:40,868 --> 00:07:42,034
The guy was an enforcer

109
00:07:42,036 --> 00:07:43,419
for La Cosa Nostra
in Brighton beach.

110
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:46,038
Stabbing's personal.

111
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,572
Is this knife from the kitchen?

112
00:07:47,574 --> 00:07:49,758
Nothing in there,
but a set of steak knives.

113
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:53,578
This is not serrated.
Looks old, dull.

114
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:57,850
Painful.

115
00:07:57,852 --> 00:08:00,019
We got a rap sheet
on this old gangster?

116
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:01,887
Reads like a phone book.

117
00:08:01,889 --> 00:08:04,606
Armed robbery, racketeering--

118
00:08:04,608 --> 00:08:09,945
He was charged with homicide
in the mid '70s.

119
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:12,364
Marlene Elias?

120
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:13,615
What was that?

121
00:08:13,617 --> 00:08:15,901
Uh, 1973.

122
00:08:15,903 --> 00:08:18,287
The murder charge he skated on.

123
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:20,605
Victim was Marlene Elias.

124
00:08:20,607 --> 00:08:22,324
The evidence
was stolen from lockup

125
00:08:22,326 --> 00:08:23,575
a couple weeks back.

126
00:08:23,577 --> 00:08:26,245
Evidence was stolen
from a 40-year-old cold case?

127
00:08:26,247 --> 00:08:27,796
And the murder weapon.

128
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:31,717
Marlene Elias was stabbed
multiple times in her chest

129
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:33,919
with a kitchen knife.

130
00:08:42,178 --> 00:08:43,729
Okay, Finch,
looks like Zoe's meeting

131
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:45,130
with some businessman.

132
00:08:45,132 --> 00:08:46,732
Sending you photos.

133
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:50,152
Got another guy watching
from a green SUV.

134
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:52,021
Run a license plate for me.

135
00:08:52,023 --> 00:08:56,975
Gray, Henry, Oscar,
Seven, Five, Six, One.

136
00:08:56,977 --> 00:08:58,444
Ms. Morgan.

137
00:08:58,446 --> 00:09:01,413
Okay, I got a hit
on that license plate.

138
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:03,315
Registered to Samuel Douglas.

139
00:09:03,317 --> 00:09:06,585
Head of crisis management
with Virtanen Pharmaceuticals.

140
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:08,153
You familiar
with Anthony Talbott?

141
00:09:08,155 --> 00:09:09,588
Should I be?

142
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:10,956
He's an investment blogger.

143
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:12,708
No ethics or boundaries.

144
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:14,676
He'd do anything
to get an inside scoop,

145
00:09:14,678 --> 00:09:17,463
including violate
our employees' right to privacy.

146
00:09:17,465 --> 00:09:19,848
We wouldn't be talking
if this had anything to do

147
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,833
with just an employee.

148
00:09:21,835 --> 00:09:23,635
So what does
he have on your boss?

149
00:09:23,637 --> 00:09:26,055
Douglas' boss is
the gentleman in the car,

150
00:09:26,057 --> 00:09:28,557
- Mark Lawson.
- A recording he claims--

151
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:29,674
A conversation
with a certain young lady

152
00:09:29,676 --> 00:09:31,843
that could be misconstrued.

153
00:09:31,845 --> 00:09:33,678
An affair?

154
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,197
Who cares?

155
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:36,482
His wife.

156
00:09:36,484 --> 00:09:38,500
Mr. Lawson is in line
to run Virtanen.

157
00:09:38,502 --> 00:09:40,519
He already handles
the day-to-day,

158
00:09:40,521 --> 00:09:43,072
but his father-in-law's
still the CEO.

159
00:09:43,074 --> 00:09:44,957
What the old man
doesn't know...

160
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,792
What's Talbott asking?

161
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:49,711
$40,000.

162
00:09:49,713 --> 00:09:51,413
His cell phone number's
in there.

163
00:09:51,415 --> 00:09:53,582
Oh, and, uh, one more thing.

164
00:09:53,584 --> 00:09:54,866
I'll get the recording.

165
00:09:54,868 --> 00:09:56,552
I don't need to
know what's on it.

166
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:59,555
We appreciate your discretion,
as always.

167
00:10:11,901 --> 00:10:14,386
Good afternoon,
Mr. Talbott.

168
00:10:14,388 --> 00:10:17,940
Nice of Virtanen
to send a skirt.

169
00:10:17,942 --> 00:10:19,724
I understand that you have
something of interest

170
00:10:19,726 --> 00:10:20,892
to my client.

171
00:10:20,894 --> 00:10:24,896
You know, it is
amazing what you can find

172
00:10:24,898 --> 00:10:28,867
just drifting out there
in the ether.

173
00:10:28,869 --> 00:10:31,253
One thing I have learned

174
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:33,839
about the, uh, smartest guys
in the room--

175
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:36,675
They just can't keep it
in their pants.

176
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:38,710
You know why I'm here.

177
00:10:38,712 --> 00:10:40,245
You know how I feel.

178
00:10:40,247 --> 00:10:43,915
I can't hide it anymore.

179
00:10:47,137 --> 00:10:48,270
This is all $40,000?

180
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:51,089
Count it.

181
00:10:51,091 --> 00:10:53,809
At home.

182
00:10:53,811 --> 00:10:57,095
By the way, I would have
asked for $80,000.

183
00:10:57,097 --> 00:10:59,565
Maybe it's a skirt thing.

184
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:05,821
Talbott's
a blackmailing scumbag,

185
00:11:05,823 --> 00:11:07,039
but hardly a threat.

186
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,173
What about her previous jobs?

187
00:11:08,175 --> 00:11:09,941
No client list
in her apartment.

188
00:11:09,943 --> 00:11:11,910
You need to get her talking.

189
00:11:11,912 --> 00:11:14,079
Easier said than done.

190
00:11:17,783 --> 00:11:19,784
Ah.

191
00:11:19,786 --> 00:11:21,086
Detective Sullivan.

192
00:11:21,088 --> 00:11:22,787
Not for years now.

193
00:11:22,789 --> 00:11:25,624
Bernie or Sully.
Dealer's choice.

194
00:11:25,626 --> 00:11:28,644
I, um, wanted to talk about
that case you worked

195
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:30,012
back in '73.

196
00:11:30,014 --> 00:11:32,130
Marlene Elias.

197
00:11:32,132 --> 00:11:35,067
How did that mess
come up again?

198
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:37,653
A man I'm investigating broke
into the evidence lockup

199
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:39,137
a few weeks ago.

200
00:11:39,139 --> 00:11:41,156
He and his crew
sold the contents

201
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:42,641
of the evidence box.

202
00:11:42,643 --> 00:11:45,160
Your notes, murder weapon,

203
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:47,029
8 inch kitchen knife.

204
00:11:47,031 --> 00:11:49,147
Which turned out plunged
into the chest

205
00:11:49,149 --> 00:11:50,666
of your lead suspect.

206
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:51,816
Hmm.

207
00:11:51,818 --> 00:11:54,853
That would be
divine retribution.

208
00:11:54,855 --> 00:11:57,673
What can you tell me
about Deluca?

209
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:59,424
Piece of work.

210
00:11:59,426 --> 00:12:02,294
I had him dead to rights
on murdering that woman.

211
00:12:02,296 --> 00:12:05,013
The dimwit left a partial
on the knife.

212
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:06,848
The DA dropped the case?

213
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:08,467
Bought and sold.

214
00:12:08,469 --> 00:12:11,136
Back then,
the city was different.

215
00:12:11,138 --> 00:12:13,505
Marlene was
a cocktail waitress.

216
00:12:13,507 --> 00:12:16,642
She worked in a club owned
by Gianni Moretti.

217
00:12:16,644 --> 00:12:18,843
She has an affair with the don.

218
00:12:18,845 --> 00:12:20,646
She wants him to dump his wife.

219
00:12:20,648 --> 00:12:23,732
He gets tired of her complaints,
and sends our friend here,

220
00:12:23,734 --> 00:12:26,368
the cutlery rack,
to shut her up.

221
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:27,852
He did.

222
00:12:27,854 --> 00:12:30,289
Permanently.

223
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,357
The thing that stuck
with me was the kid.

224
00:12:32,359 --> 00:12:33,875
Kid?
What kid?

225
00:12:33,877 --> 00:12:35,026
I dug these up.

226
00:12:35,028 --> 00:12:37,913
Marlene and the don had a kid.

227
00:12:37,915 --> 00:12:39,364
A son.

228
00:12:39,366 --> 00:12:41,800
He was out back playing
when it happened.

229
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:44,303
Came inside and he found her.

230
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:47,005
Kid walked all the way
to the station.

231
00:12:47,007 --> 00:12:51,009
I still got that image of him
standing there with no shoes on.

232
00:12:51,011 --> 00:12:52,177
What happened to him?

233
00:12:52,179 --> 00:12:54,680
Well, he didn't want
to cop to the affair,

234
00:12:54,682 --> 00:12:56,265
so the kid went
into the system.

235
00:12:56,267 --> 00:13:00,552
I don't have to tell you
what happens to those kids.

236
00:13:00,554 --> 00:13:02,721
You think he's the killer?

237
00:13:02,723 --> 00:13:05,774
Don't know who else would
go to so much trouble.

238
00:13:12,832 --> 00:13:13,782
What is that?

239
00:13:13,784 --> 00:13:15,667
Ah, just some old bootlegs.

240
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:17,068
You like jazz?

241
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:18,403
You do?

242
00:13:18,405 --> 00:13:20,205
Sure.

243
00:13:20,207 --> 00:13:23,375
Always loved what Miles Davis
said about jazz.

244
00:13:23,377 --> 00:13:27,095
"Don't play what's there.
Play what's not there."

245
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:29,514
Really?

246
00:13:29,516 --> 00:13:32,384
You seem to know
how to play people.

247
00:13:32,386 --> 00:13:35,587
I don't play people.
I fix their problems.

248
00:13:35,589 --> 00:13:39,641
And to answer your question,
no, I hate jazz.

249
00:13:52,405 --> 00:13:55,774
We're you supposed to be
meeting with two people or one?

250
00:13:55,776 --> 00:13:57,125
What does it matter?

251
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:58,710
Let me take care of this, Zoe.

252
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:00,078
It's Ms. Morgan.

253
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:04,383
Get back in the car.

254
00:14:07,321 --> 00:14:10,305
♪ ♪

255
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:12,841
You didn't tell me
it was a party.

256
00:14:12,843 --> 00:14:17,012
Talbott handed it over.
No problems.

257
00:14:30,827 --> 00:14:32,160
Did you listen to this?

258
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:36,832
You didn't hire me to listen.

259
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:38,817
Mr. Lawson would like
to personally thank you.

260
00:14:38,819 --> 00:14:40,502
His fee is
all that's necessary.

261
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:42,320
No, we insist.

262
00:14:42,322 --> 00:14:44,172
Walter, get the driver.

263
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:04,192
- Get down.
- Ah!

264
00:15:08,297 --> 00:15:10,532
Guess I'm paying you
to do more than drive.

265
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:11,733
Mr. Reese, are you okay?

266
00:15:11,735 --> 00:15:13,151
Yeah, the hand-off
was an ambush.

267
00:15:13,153 --> 00:15:14,619
Douglas tried
to kill both of us.

268
00:15:14,621 --> 00:15:16,738
Oh, thanks.
I was there, remember?

269
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:17,956
Is she safe, Mr. Reese?

270
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,207
For now.
A little shaken up.

271
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:20,859
Who are you talking to?

272
00:15:20,861 --> 00:15:22,077
They're willing to kill
for that recording.

273
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:23,912
We need to find out
what's on it.

274
00:15:23,914 --> 00:15:26,197
Send me Talbott's address.

275
00:15:26,199 --> 00:15:27,549
Who the hell are you?

276
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:28,667
You can say we're
in the same business.

277
00:15:28,669 --> 00:15:29,868
Fixing problems.

278
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:32,036
I had information that
you might be in danger.

279
00:15:32,038 --> 00:15:33,705
Information?

280
00:15:33,707 --> 00:15:34,923
Who gave it to you?

281
00:15:34,925 --> 00:15:39,227
You have your people.
I have mine.

282
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:41,263
You need to find the journalist
who sold you that recording.

283
00:15:41,265 --> 00:15:47,235
Find out what's on it.

284
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:49,321
I made a copy.

285
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:52,774
I'm discreet, not stupid.

286
00:15:52,776 --> 00:15:54,993
I can't hide it anymore.

287
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:57,061
- What we're doing is wrong.
- Who's the girl on the tape?

288
00:15:57,063 --> 00:15:59,414
No idea.
Can barely make it out.

289
00:16:13,379 --> 00:16:14,379
Stay here.

290
00:16:14,381 --> 00:16:15,464
Mr. Reese,

291
00:16:15,466 --> 00:16:18,133
report on the police band.
Talbott is dead.

292
00:16:18,135 --> 00:16:20,302
Apparent cardiac arrest.

293
00:16:20,304 --> 00:16:22,086
Oh, Douglas moves fast.

294
00:16:22,088 --> 00:16:24,523
They're killing everyone who had
contact with that recording.

295
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:25,857
If they're going
to this much trouble,

296
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:27,726
they'll be coming
after Ms. Morgan again.

297
00:16:27,728 --> 00:16:33,448
You need to stay with her.

298
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:35,033
That's going to be a problem.

299
00:16:41,891 --> 00:16:44,559
I want to tell someone.

300
00:16:44,561 --> 00:16:46,645
Keeps me up at night.

301
00:16:46,647 --> 00:16:48,947
I'm working on the audio.

302
00:16:48,949 --> 00:16:50,065
Interference suggests

303
00:16:50,067 --> 00:16:52,534
it was made on
an old PCS cell network,

304
00:16:52,536 --> 00:16:55,270
making the recording
at least two years old.

305
00:16:55,272 --> 00:16:57,539
I didn't know static
had a vintage.

306
00:16:57,541 --> 00:17:01,893
I did manage to find a match
on the woman's voice.

307
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:03,945
Compared it against video

308
00:17:03,947 --> 00:17:07,048
from social networking sites,
corporate press.

309
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:10,418
268 possible matches,
6 who lived in New York

310
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:13,722
but only one who worked
at Virtanen Pharmaceuticals.

311
00:17:13,724 --> 00:17:15,423
Virtanen is more than

312
00:17:15,425 --> 00:17:16,474
just a pharmaceutical company.

313
00:17:16,476 --> 00:17:19,010
We create products
that help and heal.

314
00:17:19,012 --> 00:17:21,980
Virtanen is a family.

315
00:17:21,982 --> 00:17:25,233
One I hope to be a part of
for many years to come.

316
00:17:25,235 --> 00:17:27,269
Dana Miller, Lawson's mistress,

317
00:17:27,271 --> 00:17:29,487
was an office romance.

318
00:17:29,489 --> 00:17:30,772
Nice work, Finch.

319
00:17:30,774 --> 00:17:36,161
I wouldn't be so quick
to congratulate me.

320
00:17:36,163 --> 00:17:37,445
It's not the first time

321
00:17:37,447 --> 00:17:41,750
I've heard Dana Miller's name.

322
00:17:41,752 --> 00:17:47,005
Six months ago,
the machine gave me her number.

323
00:17:48,824 --> 00:17:49,874
I had yet to track you down,

324
00:17:49,876 --> 00:17:53,011
so I wasn't in
a position to help her.

325
00:17:53,013 --> 00:17:57,498
Newspaper said she died
of a brain aneurysm.

326
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,500
She was 27, and as you know,

327
00:17:59,502 --> 00:18:02,887
the machine
doesn't see accidents.

328
00:18:02,889 --> 00:18:04,689
So she wanted to go public
with the affair,

329
00:18:04,691 --> 00:18:06,942
and Lawson had her
killed for it.

330
00:18:06,944 --> 00:18:08,693
Why not pay her off, Finch?

331
00:18:08,695 --> 00:18:11,863
Lawson is heir
to the entire Virtanen empire.

332
00:18:11,865 --> 00:18:15,183
If Robert Keller ever found out,
Lawson would lose everything.

333
00:18:15,185 --> 00:18:16,234
It wouldn't be hard for someone

334
00:18:16,236 --> 00:18:17,902
working at
a pharmaceutical company

335
00:18:17,904 --> 00:18:21,189
to make murder
look like natural causes.

336
00:18:21,191 --> 00:18:23,658
I never thought
I'd know the truth

337
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:26,461
about what happened to her.

338
00:18:26,463 --> 00:18:29,831
Now I also know
the men responsible.

339
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:34,169
We can stop them from ever
giving us another number.

340
00:18:34,171 --> 00:18:36,338
Get out there,
and find Ms. Morgan.

341
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,473
Every moment we don't have her

342
00:18:38,475 --> 00:18:40,208
is a moment that
Douglas can get to her.

343
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:41,509
Well, what are you going to do?

344
00:18:41,511 --> 00:18:45,713
I have an important
business meeting.

345
00:18:45,715 --> 00:18:47,899
Recent investment of mine.

346
00:18:53,022 --> 00:18:54,239
We cleared my schedule

347
00:18:54,241 --> 00:18:56,274
for a meeting
with a shareholder.

348
00:18:56,276 --> 00:18:58,026
Guy isn't just a shareholder.

349
00:18:58,028 --> 00:19:02,247
Bought 87 million shares
in the last 48 hours.

350
00:19:02,249 --> 00:19:05,083
He now owns 8%
of Virtanen stock.

351
00:19:05,085 --> 00:19:06,368
Never heard of this guy.

352
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:07,419
No one has.

353
00:19:07,421 --> 00:19:09,237
May be a straw buyer
for a takeover.

354
00:19:09,239 --> 00:19:10,672
Hostile bid.

355
00:19:10,674 --> 00:19:12,374
But, uh--
Kid gloves.

356
00:19:12,376 --> 00:19:13,958
And we may want to wheel
the old man in here

357
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,410
for a minute
to press the flesh.

358
00:19:15,412 --> 00:19:17,212
Right this way, sir.

359
00:19:21,884 --> 00:19:24,102
Mr. Partridge.

360
00:19:24,104 --> 00:19:25,854
Mark Lawson.
Pleasure to meet you, sir.

361
00:19:25,856 --> 00:19:27,772
Thank you for meeting me
on such short notice.

362
00:19:27,774 --> 00:19:30,308
I thought I knew everyone
with an investment portfolio

363
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:31,776
as broad as yours.

364
00:19:31,778 --> 00:19:33,945
When you're in a position
where people want your money,

365
00:19:33,947 --> 00:19:36,948
a little anonymity
is rather rewarding.

366
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:38,149
From my time in Japan.

367
00:19:38,151 --> 00:19:39,317
I've learned never to go

368
00:19:39,319 --> 00:19:40,618
to a business meeting
empty-handed.

369
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:43,438
That is--
You're generous.

370
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,107
Thank you.

371
00:19:46,109 --> 00:19:48,293
You care for
a tour of our facilities?

372
00:19:48,295 --> 00:19:50,578
This way.

373
00:19:52,665 --> 00:19:54,632
What we like to focus on

374
00:19:54,634 --> 00:19:56,134
is what people really need--

375
00:19:56,136 --> 00:19:57,669
Pain relief.

376
00:19:57,671 --> 00:19:59,721
I can certainly relate to that.

377
00:19:59,723 --> 00:20:02,390
We reached a 20% market share
last year.

378
00:20:02,392 --> 00:20:04,625
And that's only going to rise
with the launch

379
00:20:04,627 --> 00:20:07,812
of our new product line,
anchored by Sylocet.

380
00:20:07,814 --> 00:20:08,897
Sylocet?

381
00:20:08,899 --> 00:20:10,315
New migraine drug.

382
00:20:10,317 --> 00:20:11,766
Revolutionary.

383
00:20:11,768 --> 00:20:14,354
Just approved by the FDA.

384
00:20:17,357 --> 00:20:20,525
Mr. Partridge.

385
00:20:20,527 --> 00:20:22,310
Robert Keller.

386
00:20:22,312 --> 00:20:24,362
This is an impressive empire
you've built here, sir.

387
00:20:24,364 --> 00:20:26,448
Oh, it's Mark's empire now.

388
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:28,917
Retirement isn't officially
till next spring,

389
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:32,537
but he makes
all the big decisions.

390
00:20:32,539 --> 00:20:34,005
Don't tell anyone.

391
00:20:34,007 --> 00:20:36,040
I'd hate to lose my table
at the country club.

392
00:20:38,328 --> 00:20:40,345
If you'll excuse me,
Mr. Partridge.

393
00:20:40,347 --> 00:20:41,996
Mark has done
an incredible job.

394
00:20:41,998 --> 00:20:44,516
Not only in keeping
our finances in order,

395
00:20:44,518 --> 00:20:46,434
but overseeing a good amount

396
00:20:46,436 --> 00:20:48,353
of product research.

397
00:20:48,355 --> 00:20:50,305
Mr. Keller,
I like what I see here.

398
00:20:50,307 --> 00:20:53,641
I'm confident
my money is in good hands.

399
00:20:53,643 --> 00:20:58,313
Lovely meeting you.

400
00:21:00,032 --> 00:21:02,734
Excuse me.

401
00:21:02,736 --> 00:21:06,237
I have to take this.

402
00:21:06,239 --> 00:21:07,822
Flash drive's recovered.

403
00:21:07,824 --> 00:21:11,326
Talbott won't be
a problem again.

404
00:21:11,328 --> 00:21:13,194
Great work.

405
00:21:13,196 --> 00:21:14,629
But just one loose end.

406
00:21:14,631 --> 00:21:16,214
Zoe Morgan.

407
00:21:16,216 --> 00:21:18,383
She had a bodyguard
posing as a driver.

408
00:21:18,385 --> 00:21:23,421
It was an unforeseen
circumstance.

409
00:21:23,423 --> 00:21:24,872
It's not a loose end.

410
00:21:24,874 --> 00:21:26,808
It's the whole damn thing
falling apart.

411
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:27,926
I'll handle her.

412
00:21:27,928 --> 00:21:30,128
And the driver, too.

413
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:32,514
Nothing can connect us
to this thing.

414
00:21:38,355 --> 00:21:39,654
Carter.

415
00:21:39,656 --> 00:21:40,721
It's Sully.

416
00:21:40,723 --> 00:21:42,490
I managed to fill in
some of the blanks

417
00:21:42,492 --> 00:21:44,075
on young Carl Elias.

418
00:21:44,077 --> 00:21:45,360
Good work.

419
00:21:45,362 --> 00:21:47,162
No, not so good.

420
00:21:47,164 --> 00:21:49,831
The kid was like
a professional runaway.

421
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:51,449
From the age of eight,
he couldn't stay anywhere

422
00:21:51,451 --> 00:21:52,500
more than a couple of months.

423
00:21:52,502 --> 00:21:54,335
So no one really knew him.

424
00:21:54,337 --> 00:21:59,340
Nobody except some tough old
bird named Gloria Recinto.

425
00:21:59,342 --> 00:22:01,409
Apparently, she, uh,
she looked after him.

426
00:22:01,411 --> 00:22:04,179
He would send
her a Christmas card

427
00:22:04,181 --> 00:22:05,746
and some money every year.

428
00:22:05,748 --> 00:22:08,266
You gotta read
these things, Carla.

429
00:22:08,268 --> 00:22:09,517
I mean it's as if the guy

430
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:11,970
was going to either be president
or Attila the Hun.

431
00:22:11,972 --> 00:22:13,771
You want me to bring him in?

432
00:22:13,773 --> 00:22:14,939
I'll swing by,
and pick them up.

433
00:22:14,941 --> 00:22:16,224
Oh.

434
00:22:16,226 --> 00:22:17,942
Well, I'm going to make myself
beautiful for you.

435
00:22:17,944 --> 00:22:20,478
Good luck with that, Sully.

436
00:22:22,731 --> 00:22:26,401
Know why I'm here.
You know how I feel.

437
00:22:26,403 --> 00:22:27,768
I still can't find Zoe.

438
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:29,437
I can't hide it anymore.

439
00:22:29,439 --> 00:22:33,107
If I can't track her down,
Douglas probably can't either.

440
00:22:37,446 --> 00:22:38,713
Trying to clean up
this recording.

441
00:22:38,715 --> 00:22:41,282
Fill in the blanks.

442
00:22:41,284 --> 00:22:45,253
I think Dana recorded this
in Lawson's office, listen.

443
00:22:45,255 --> 00:22:46,688
What we're doing is wrong.

444
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:47,889
So?

445
00:22:47,891 --> 00:22:50,592
She recorded the conversation
on her cell phone.

446
00:22:50,594 --> 00:22:51,643
To blackmail him?

447
00:22:51,645 --> 00:22:54,062
No, I don't think so.

448
00:22:54,064 --> 00:22:55,730
Here's the fountain
in his office.

449
00:22:55,732 --> 00:22:57,065
Using the bug I planted,

450
00:22:57,067 --> 00:23:01,019
I was able to get room tone,

451
00:23:01,021 --> 00:23:04,806
then I can strip it back out
of the original recording.

452
00:23:04,808 --> 00:23:06,140
Listen.
This is much clearer.

453
00:23:06,142 --> 00:23:07,909
I can't hide it anymore.

454
00:23:07,911 --> 00:23:09,844
What we're doing is wrong.

455
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:11,412
I want to tell someone.

456
00:23:11,414 --> 00:23:13,414
Keeps me up at night,
knowing what our drug has done.

457
00:23:13,416 --> 00:23:16,200
You need to think
very carefully...

458
00:23:16,202 --> 00:23:19,654
"Keeps me up at night,
knowing what our drug has done""

459
00:23:19,656 --> 00:23:21,623
I still have to clean up
the last part of the recording,

460
00:23:21,625 --> 00:23:23,708
but there's enough here
that you can tell

461
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:26,994
that Dana was not having
an affair with Lawson.

462
00:23:26,996 --> 00:23:30,265
She was threatening
to blow the whistle on him.

463
00:23:36,889 --> 00:23:38,473
You know, before we--

464
00:23:38,475 --> 00:23:42,176
before I found you,

465
00:23:42,178 --> 00:23:47,031
the numbers haunted me.

466
00:23:47,033 --> 00:23:51,035
I never felt so helpless
in my entire life.

467
00:23:51,037 --> 00:23:53,955
And I know I can't get justice
for all of them,

468
00:23:53,957 --> 00:23:59,711
but the possibility
of having just one...

469
00:24:03,583 --> 00:24:04,832
Looks like our Ms. Morgan

470
00:24:04,834 --> 00:24:07,535
has decided
to be found after all.

471
00:24:07,537 --> 00:24:08,803
This time, when you find her,

472
00:24:08,805 --> 00:24:12,473
try not to lose her.

473
00:24:29,558 --> 00:24:32,860
So you are tracking
my cell phone.

474
00:24:32,862 --> 00:24:36,731
I know how all the pieces
of the city fit together.

475
00:24:36,733 --> 00:24:38,833
I know all the players.

476
00:24:38,835 --> 00:24:42,120
I know all the angles.

477
00:24:42,122 --> 00:24:45,506
And then there's you.

478
00:24:45,508 --> 00:24:49,577
You know, I don't understand you.

479
00:24:49,579 --> 00:24:52,013
And I don't like things
that I don't understand.

480
00:24:52,015 --> 00:24:53,798
Then why did
you want me to come here?

481
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,717
Because I don't have
to like you

482
00:24:55,719 --> 00:24:57,802
to get some news out of you.

483
00:24:57,804 --> 00:25:00,605
The girl on the recording.

484
00:25:00,607 --> 00:25:02,607
Her name was Dana Miller.

485
00:25:02,609 --> 00:25:05,026
Lawson had her killed.

486
00:25:05,028 --> 00:25:07,362
Maybe not because
she was sleeping with him.

487
00:25:07,364 --> 00:25:08,813
I know.

488
00:25:08,815 --> 00:25:10,314
She worked at Virtanen.

489
00:25:10,316 --> 00:25:12,266
She was going
to come out in public--

490
00:25:12,268 --> 00:25:14,819
A scandal involving
one of their drugs.

491
00:25:14,821 --> 00:25:17,321
Not bad,

492
00:25:17,323 --> 00:25:19,106
but it's not the whole story.

493
00:25:19,108 --> 00:25:20,875
She worked in clinical trials.

494
00:25:20,877 --> 00:25:24,328
Five days before she was killed,
she was transferred out.

495
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:25,780
Access suspended.

496
00:25:25,782 --> 00:25:27,448
How did you come by that?

497
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:31,669
You have your people.
I have mine.

498
00:25:31,671 --> 00:25:33,120
Let me guess.

499
00:25:33,122 --> 00:25:35,473
You're looking to strike
a deal with Virtanen.

500
00:25:35,475 --> 00:25:37,258
No, not this time.

501
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:40,261
I thought everyone
had an angle.

502
00:25:40,263 --> 00:25:44,565
I knew this girl once.

503
00:25:44,567 --> 00:25:46,484
Naive.

504
00:25:46,486 --> 00:25:51,572
She got a tough lesson
on the way the world works.

505
00:25:51,574 --> 00:25:54,308
That reminds me of Dana.

506
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:57,779
Also, they tried to kill you.

507
00:25:57,781 --> 00:26:00,865
Well, there's that, too.

508
00:26:04,002 --> 00:26:06,871
You want to get out of here?

509
00:26:06,873 --> 00:26:09,040
Where are we going?

510
00:26:09,042 --> 00:26:12,260
To do something illegal.

511
00:26:22,502 --> 00:26:25,253
Lieutenant Gilmore.

512
00:26:25,255 --> 00:26:28,156
Almost didn't recognize you
without that cute uniform.

513
00:26:28,158 --> 00:26:29,424
What do you want now?

514
00:26:29,426 --> 00:26:30,509
There's going to be a break-in

515
00:26:30,511 --> 00:26:32,260
at Virtanen Pharmaceuticals
tonight.

516
00:26:32,262 --> 00:26:37,148
I need you to make sure
that the police don't respond.

517
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:40,352
After this, we're done.

518
00:26:47,276 --> 00:26:49,160
All right, Finch,
our cameras are in place.

519
00:26:49,162 --> 00:26:51,580
I have full coverage.
Proceed.

520
00:26:57,870 --> 00:27:00,655
Hold this.

521
00:27:00,657 --> 00:27:02,424
So these people are
trying to kill you,

522
00:27:02,426 --> 00:27:05,010
and your plan is to break
into their offices.

523
00:27:05,012 --> 00:27:07,345
I prefer the direct approach.

524
00:27:07,347 --> 00:27:09,664
The South entry.
Any guards on the other side?

525
00:27:09,666 --> 00:27:12,667
Two guards on the first floor,
none on the stairwell.

526
00:27:12,669 --> 00:27:14,269
Go ahead.

527
00:27:14,271 --> 00:27:15,637
Going in.

528
00:27:15,639 --> 00:27:18,890
Am I ever going to meet this
imaginary friend?

529
00:27:18,892 --> 00:27:21,977
He's a very private person.

530
00:27:21,979 --> 00:27:24,279
Wait, there's a guard
on the third floor stairs.

531
00:27:24,281 --> 00:27:26,464
He's coming your way.

532
00:27:34,457 --> 00:27:37,125
You're clear.
Go.

533
00:27:49,221 --> 00:27:50,555
You're probably
one of those guys

534
00:27:50,557 --> 00:27:52,307
that can get out of anything
with a paper clip.

535
00:27:52,309 --> 00:27:54,009
Where did you learn this skill?

536
00:27:54,011 --> 00:27:58,013
It's a long story.

537
00:27:58,015 --> 00:28:02,651
Still clear, Mr. Reese.

538
00:28:07,658 --> 00:28:10,241
They deleted Dana Miller's
email and browser history

539
00:28:10,243 --> 00:28:11,443
months ago.

540
00:28:11,445 --> 00:28:13,194
Nothing is ever really
deleted, Mr. Reese.

541
00:28:13,196 --> 00:28:14,579
The pieces are always
out there.

542
00:28:14,581 --> 00:28:16,448
You just got to know
how to put them back together.

543
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:18,450
Use the recovery software.

544
00:28:18,452 --> 00:28:20,835
All right.

545
00:28:35,768 --> 00:28:36,801
Right there.

546
00:28:36,803 --> 00:28:38,553
She accessed this file
a dozen times

547
00:28:38,555 --> 00:28:42,524
in the days
before she was killed.

548
00:28:44,428 --> 00:28:47,679
Looks like a clinical trial
for the new drug Sylocet.

549
00:28:47,681 --> 00:28:49,547
FDA approved.

550
00:28:49,549 --> 00:28:51,700
But it's been altered.

551
00:28:51,702 --> 00:28:53,368
These are two files
with the same name,

552
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:55,370
but the older one
is slightly larger.

553
00:29:00,944 --> 00:29:03,011
Six names are missing
from the trail data

554
00:29:03,013 --> 00:29:05,080
that Virtanen submitted
to the FDA.

555
00:29:05,082 --> 00:29:06,998
I need those names,
Mr. Reese.

556
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,185
Here it comes.

557
00:29:21,263 --> 00:29:23,598
They're all dead,
Mr. Reese.

558
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,933
Dead?

559
00:29:24,935 --> 00:29:28,403
Every person on that list
died of heart failure

560
00:29:28,405 --> 00:29:30,488
within a year
of taking the drug.

561
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:31,806
Lawson must've dropped
them from the study

562
00:29:31,808 --> 00:29:32,991
and paid the locals to hide it.

563
00:29:32,993 --> 00:29:35,476
Their new wonder drug
is a killer.

564
00:29:35,478 --> 00:29:38,113
It's 6 people out of 200.
That's a 3% mortality rate.

565
00:29:38,115 --> 00:29:41,249
If a million people
take that drug,

566
00:29:41,251 --> 00:29:45,486
30,000 can die.

567
00:29:45,488 --> 00:29:49,424
Wait, was is that sound?

568
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:53,178
Air conditioning.
Why?

569
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:54,879
That's what I've been missing.

570
00:29:54,881 --> 00:29:56,347
Listen.

571
00:29:56,349 --> 00:29:59,601
Don't talk, don't move.
I need a clean recording.

572
00:30:03,139 --> 00:30:05,223
Perfect.

573
00:30:05,225 --> 00:30:08,009
I'll be in touch.

574
00:30:10,679 --> 00:30:13,698
Well, well, well.

575
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:17,702
Guess we should
call the cops, huh.

576
00:30:17,704 --> 00:30:19,954
Bad move, lieutenant.

577
00:30:19,956 --> 00:30:22,157
If I can't trust you,
I'll have to destroy you.

578
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:25,326
Something makes me think
you won't get that chance.

579
00:30:25,328 --> 00:30:28,630
Besides, I held up my end.

580
00:30:28,632 --> 00:30:32,500
You wanted the cops
not to respond?

581
00:30:32,502 --> 00:30:35,170
This is the cops
not responding.

582
00:30:41,543 --> 00:30:44,512
Keeps me up at night,
knowing what our drug has done.

583
00:30:44,514 --> 00:30:46,214
You need to think
very carefully...

584
00:30:47,684 --> 00:30:49,484
You're leaving
me with no choice.

585
00:30:49,486 --> 00:30:53,354
I'm going to go to Keller.

586
00:30:53,356 --> 00:30:57,158
Reese, I think
I've found something.

587
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:00,061
Mr. Reese?

588
00:31:00,063 --> 00:31:02,280
I told you I'd handle it.

589
00:31:02,282 --> 00:31:03,665
I've got them both.

590
00:31:03,667 --> 00:31:06,567
I'm on my way.

591
00:31:10,005 --> 00:31:14,959
You never did
tell me your name.

592
00:31:14,961 --> 00:31:16,544
John.

593
00:31:16,546 --> 00:31:19,380
My name's John.

594
00:31:19,382 --> 00:31:23,351
Of course it is.

595
00:31:23,353 --> 00:31:24,519
So, John...

596
00:31:24,521 --> 00:31:27,605
How did you know
I was going to be in trouble?

597
00:31:27,607 --> 00:31:30,091
Given your choice of career,

598
00:31:30,093 --> 00:31:34,428
doesn't seem
like much of a stretch.

599
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:36,648
You might consider
a new line of work.

600
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:40,268
You're one to judge.

601
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:44,873
Besides, you don't know
anything about me.

602
00:31:44,875 --> 00:31:47,742
I know almost
everything about you.

603
00:31:47,744 --> 00:31:51,713
I know you grew up
in a nice house in Yonkers.

604
00:31:51,715 --> 00:31:53,581
I know your dad
was a city official

605
00:31:53,583 --> 00:31:57,335
till he got snared
in a corruption case.

606
00:31:57,337 --> 00:32:00,588
I know you spent
the rest of your childhood

607
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:04,259
in a little apartment
in Queens with your mother.

608
00:32:04,261 --> 00:32:08,496
About the only thing
I don't know about you

609
00:32:08,498 --> 00:32:11,966
is why you started doing
whatever it is you do.

610
00:32:17,306 --> 00:32:21,326
My dad was a party man.

611
00:32:21,328 --> 00:32:24,645
Machine politician.

612
00:32:24,647 --> 00:32:27,782
Did what he was told.

613
00:32:27,784 --> 00:32:31,703
Right up until
the cops showed up,

614
00:32:31,705 --> 00:32:34,539
put the cuffs on him.

615
00:32:34,541 --> 00:32:36,941
The local press was
camped out on our lawn

616
00:32:36,943 --> 00:32:39,093
for weeks.

617
00:32:39,095 --> 00:32:43,298
Then this guy showed up,

618
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:46,500
the guy that the party
would send to deal with...

619
00:32:46,502 --> 00:32:50,605
Uncomfortable situations.

620
00:32:50,607 --> 00:32:52,506
He said two words.

621
00:32:52,508 --> 00:32:56,144
And those reporters?

622
00:32:56,146 --> 00:32:59,480
They packed up, and they left,

623
00:32:59,482 --> 00:33:01,783
and they never came back.

624
00:33:01,785 --> 00:33:07,572
And I realized,
that's what I want to be.

625
00:33:07,574 --> 00:33:10,742
The person who knows
what to say,

626
00:33:10,744 --> 00:33:15,163
and always has
something to trade.

627
00:33:15,165 --> 00:33:20,418
So what are you
going to trade now?

628
00:33:26,175 --> 00:33:27,642
Yes, it's Mr. Partridge.

629
00:33:27,644 --> 00:33:29,227
I need to speak to Mr. Keller,
immediately.

630
00:33:29,229 --> 00:33:30,345
I'm sorry, sir,

631
00:33:30,347 --> 00:33:31,479
but Mr. Keller
is currently unavailable.

632
00:33:31,481 --> 00:33:32,880
Listen, put him
on the phone right now.

633
00:33:32,882 --> 00:33:34,182
It's extremely urgent.

634
00:33:34,184 --> 00:33:37,936
A matter of life and death.

635
00:33:37,938 --> 00:33:40,939
So we're finally
face-to-face.

636
00:33:40,941 --> 00:33:42,390
You're making a mistake, Mark.

637
00:33:42,392 --> 00:33:44,859
I'm not the one
handcuffed to a chair.

638
00:33:44,861 --> 00:33:46,995
So you saw the Sylocet report?

639
00:33:46,997 --> 00:33:47,996
Hope you don't mind.

640
00:33:47,998 --> 00:33:49,730
I emailed a copy to a friend

641
00:33:49,732 --> 00:33:53,034
so I could read it
more thoroughly.

642
00:33:55,671 --> 00:33:57,372
Okay, so where is it now?

643
00:33:57,374 --> 00:34:00,074
With the only person I trust.

644
00:34:00,076 --> 00:34:03,127
And if anything happens to us,
that report goes public.

645
00:34:03,129 --> 00:34:05,746
Everyone will know
your new drug kills.

646
00:34:05,748 --> 00:34:09,968
What do you think Keller will
do to you when he finds out?

647
00:34:09,970 --> 00:34:11,269
Tell you what.

648
00:34:11,271 --> 00:34:12,603
Since Zoe loves
negotiating so much,

649
00:34:12,605 --> 00:34:15,139
I'll offer you two a deal.

650
00:34:15,141 --> 00:34:18,443
First one to give up
that report gets to live.

651
00:34:22,398 --> 00:34:23,448
I've reached Mr. Keller.

652
00:34:23,450 --> 00:34:24,649
He'll be with you
in just a moment.

653
00:34:24,651 --> 00:34:28,202
Thank you.

654
00:34:28,204 --> 00:34:30,221
You're leaving me
with no choice.

655
00:34:30,223 --> 00:34:31,990
I'm gonna go to Keller.

656
00:34:31,992 --> 00:34:33,458
You want to tell the old man?

657
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:35,543
Here's your chance.

658
00:34:35,545 --> 00:34:36,944
You think anything
happens in my company

659
00:34:36,946 --> 00:34:38,730
without me knowing it,
young lady?

660
00:34:38,732 --> 00:34:42,383
How stupid do you think I am?

661
00:34:42,385 --> 00:34:43,368
Mr. Partridge?

662
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:44,619
You're on with Mr. Keller.

663
00:34:53,595 --> 00:34:57,015
Mark, why aren't they dead yet?

664
00:34:57,017 --> 00:35:00,301
She says she has
a copy of the report.

665
00:35:00,303 --> 00:35:01,819
And just when I thought
you could handle

666
00:35:01,821 --> 00:35:04,155
something truly important.

667
00:35:07,642 --> 00:35:11,312
Ms. Morgan,
be reasonable.

668
00:35:11,314 --> 00:35:14,148
Every new drug
has side effects.

669
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:16,417
That's why
we have disclaimers...

670
00:35:16,419 --> 00:35:18,652
And insurance.

671
00:35:18,654 --> 00:35:23,174
This moral crusade
doesn't suit you.

672
00:35:23,176 --> 00:35:27,678
The Zoe Morgan
I know is reasonable.

673
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:33,217
Knows when to make
a smart play.

674
00:35:35,971 --> 00:35:38,523
I'll get you the report.

675
00:35:40,442 --> 00:35:42,310
I'll bring you right to it.

676
00:35:49,851 --> 00:35:53,154
Told you.

677
00:35:53,156 --> 00:35:56,407
Always have something to trade.

678
00:36:02,081 --> 00:36:04,298
Let's go.

679
00:36:17,664 --> 00:36:20,632
You know, you really
shouldn't be surprised

680
00:36:20,634 --> 00:36:23,052
by what Zoe did.

681
00:36:23,054 --> 00:36:25,054
Never trusted that bitch.

682
00:36:25,056 --> 00:36:28,807
Always looking for an angle.

683
00:36:28,809 --> 00:36:30,709
Potassium chloride?

684
00:36:30,711 --> 00:36:34,146
Government uses it
for lethal injections.

685
00:36:34,148 --> 00:36:37,483
Stops a heart in minutes.

686
00:36:37,485 --> 00:36:39,401
Quite humanely, really.

687
00:36:39,403 --> 00:36:41,103
Lucky you.

688
00:36:41,105 --> 00:36:45,157
Lucky me?

689
00:37:02,626 --> 00:37:04,960
I'm on my way, now.

690
00:37:04,962 --> 00:37:06,512
The Naval Yard.

691
00:37:06,514 --> 00:37:09,765
Jail rules.
No more phones.

692
00:37:09,767 --> 00:37:12,851
Clever girl.

693
00:37:15,139 --> 00:37:16,221
Finch.

694
00:37:16,223 --> 00:37:18,190
Been trying
to get you for two hours.

695
00:37:18,192 --> 00:37:19,424
Keller's involved.

696
00:37:19,426 --> 00:37:20,709
He and Lawson
worked it together,

697
00:37:20,711 --> 00:37:22,928
up to, and including
Dana's murder.

698
00:37:22,930 --> 00:37:26,264
I know. Keller blindsided us,
and so did Zoe.

699
00:37:26,266 --> 00:37:28,233
She's about
to hand over the copy

700
00:37:28,235 --> 00:37:29,952
of that trial data to Lawson.

701
00:37:29,954 --> 00:37:32,321
You should be more trusting,
Mr. Reese.

702
00:37:32,323 --> 00:37:34,039
Zoe just sent me
her destination.

703
00:37:34,041 --> 00:37:36,942
Naval Yard.
Sound familiar?

704
00:37:36,944 --> 00:37:40,162
- I'm on my way.
- Ready, sir?

705
00:37:46,452 --> 00:37:49,505
Mr. Keller.
Sorry I'm late.

706
00:37:49,507 --> 00:37:51,840
Sorry I started without you,
Mr. Partridge,

707
00:37:51,842 --> 00:37:55,010
but when you're as old as I am,
you can't waste a minute.

708
00:37:56,130 --> 00:37:59,314
What's your poison?

709
00:38:06,472 --> 00:38:08,140
What the hell
are we doing here?

710
00:38:08,142 --> 00:38:13,695
You want your report, right?

711
00:38:13,697 --> 00:38:16,498
He's right over there.

712
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,951
You want me to go get it
or-- or you?

713
00:38:25,425 --> 00:38:29,261
No, I don't think so.
You know what I think?

714
00:38:29,263 --> 00:38:31,797
I don't think you emailed that
report to anybody at all.

715
00:38:31,799 --> 00:38:37,002
In fact, I think it's been right
here all along.

716
00:38:38,555 --> 00:38:41,106
You picked a perfect time
to join us, Mr. Partridge.

717
00:38:41,108 --> 00:38:43,792
Once Sylocet
goes on the market,

718
00:38:43,794 --> 00:38:48,697
you'll never have to
invest in another company again.

719
00:38:50,567 --> 00:38:52,401
If anybody else, you know,
they would have sent

720
00:38:52,403 --> 00:38:56,071
this report to the police
or the press.

721
00:38:56,073 --> 00:38:57,522
But not you.

722
00:38:57,524 --> 00:39:00,409
No, you just couldn't resist
holding onto one more card.

723
00:39:00,411 --> 00:39:02,461
Yup.

724
00:39:02,463 --> 00:39:03,662
So you did send it

725
00:39:03,664 --> 00:39:06,198
to the one person in the world
you could trust.

726
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:10,219
Yourself.

727
00:39:10,221 --> 00:39:14,640
Now you're going
to take it to the grave.

728
00:39:14,642 --> 00:39:15,974
Let's get the hell out of here.

729
00:39:17,928 --> 00:39:19,411
Zoe!

730
00:39:19,413 --> 00:39:23,015
Ah!

731
00:39:23,017 --> 00:39:24,600
Migraine, huh?

732
00:39:24,602 --> 00:39:28,654
Heard they got a pill
for that now.

733
00:39:28,656 --> 00:39:30,856
Took your time.

734
00:39:32,775 --> 00:39:34,226
And at what point did you know

735
00:39:34,228 --> 00:39:35,861
you were going to do
the right thing?

736
00:39:35,863 --> 00:39:39,731
About two seconds before
I slipped you the paper clip.

737
00:39:42,118 --> 00:39:44,953
Anyway...

738
00:39:44,955 --> 00:39:48,340
Pleasant as it is to talk,
the board and I do need to know

739
00:39:48,342 --> 00:39:50,959
what your...lntentions are,

740
00:39:50,961 --> 00:39:52,911
now that you own
8% of Virtanen.

741
00:39:58,918 --> 00:40:02,804
Actually, I've sold
my shares in Virtanen.

742
00:40:02,806 --> 00:40:06,725
I had a tip that the price
is about to take a nosedive.

743
00:40:06,727 --> 00:40:09,928
Tip? What tip?

744
00:40:09,930 --> 00:40:11,964
That senior management
was about to have

745
00:40:11,966 --> 00:40:14,099
some very serious
legal problems.

746
00:40:14,101 --> 00:40:18,120
In fact, I took
my initial investment,

747
00:40:18,122 --> 00:40:20,539
and I shorted your company...

748
00:40:20,541 --> 00:40:22,991
To the tune of
1/2 billion shares.

749
00:40:22,993 --> 00:40:27,129
If you're betting against me,

750
00:40:27,131 --> 00:40:30,048
you clearly don't know
who you're dealing with.

751
00:40:30,050 --> 00:40:33,969
Oh, I know exactly what
kind of man I'm dealing with.

752
00:40:33,971 --> 00:40:37,472
And I know you don't care who
you hurt to get what you want.

753
00:40:37,474 --> 00:40:42,844
I know the only thing you do
care about is money.

754
00:40:42,846 --> 00:40:46,431
So that's what I'm going
to take from you.

755
00:40:46,433 --> 00:40:49,067
Your money.
All of it.

756
00:40:49,069 --> 00:40:51,903
You were right, Mr. Keller.

757
00:40:51,905 --> 00:40:53,989
Thanks to you,

758
00:40:53,991 --> 00:40:57,909
I never will have to
invest in another company.

759
00:41:18,965 --> 00:41:22,834
Detective Sullivan?

760
00:41:22,836 --> 00:41:25,220
Sully?

761
00:41:25,222 --> 00:41:28,006
It's me, Car--

762
00:41:28,008 --> 00:41:32,227
Oh, no.

763
00:41:35,114 --> 00:41:36,064
Police!

764
00:42:00,973 --> 00:42:02,941
Virtanen CEO Robert Keller

765
00:42:02,943 --> 00:42:04,509
is expected
to appear in court today

766
00:42:04,511 --> 00:42:06,878
alongside CFO and son-in-law,
Mark Lawson.

767
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:09,147
To answer charges of fraud,
conspiracy, and murder.

768
00:42:09,149 --> 00:42:11,316
Virtanen's migraine drug,
Sylocet,

769
00:42:11,318 --> 00:42:12,984
has officially been shelved.

770
00:42:12,986 --> 00:42:14,319
Virtanen's competitor,
beecher pharmaceuticals...

771
00:42:14,321 --> 00:42:15,937
You mind turning
that off, please?

772
00:42:15,939 --> 00:42:20,192
Sounds like beecher
got an inside tip.

773
00:42:20,194 --> 00:42:22,694
Somebody must have had
a big payday.

774
00:42:22,696 --> 00:42:24,946
Not as big as you think.

775
00:42:24,948 --> 00:42:27,249
Dana Miller's family
got a healthy donation

776
00:42:27,251 --> 00:42:29,701
for their suit against Virtanen.

777
00:42:29,703 --> 00:42:31,403
I also heard that
Lieutenant Gilmore

778
00:42:31,405 --> 00:42:32,504
found himself up against

779
00:42:32,506 --> 00:42:36,007
some pretty serious
corruption charges.

780
00:42:36,009 --> 00:42:39,744
Must have upset someone
pretty influential.

781
00:42:43,015 --> 00:42:45,100
