1
00:00:06,924 --> 00:00:08,759
Previously on The West Wing:

2
00:00:08,926 --> 00:00:10,719
- What are you doing?
- Excuse me?

3
00:00:10,886 --> 00:00:12,846
We don't push agendas here.

4
00:00:13,305 --> 00:00:14,681
I don't believe I am.

5
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:16,975
I was in a lockdown
for 77 hours once.

6
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:18,727
- Where was that?
- Overseas.

7
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:21,396
Okay. I get it. CIA.

8
00:00:21,605 --> 00:00:24,233
I could look you up.
I have code word clearance.

9
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:25,984
Not this code, you don't.

10
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:30,614
We have the ability to effect more
change in a day at the White House...

11
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:33,700
...than we have in a lifetime
once we walk out these doors.

12
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:35,494
What do you wanna do with them?

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,074
Watch Movies, Series & LiveTV
www.flixify.app

14
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:56,408
- Leo, you know what time it is?
- Good morning, Mr. President.

15
00:01:56,617 --> 00:02:00,537
I'll be the judge of that.
It's a little after 5 a. m.

16
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:04,625
-5: 13, to be precise.
- It wasn't my favorite thing, calling you.

17
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:08,462
- Yeah, I had to run the gauntlet upstairs.
- That can be special.

18
00:02:09,505 --> 00:02:13,467
"The world breaks everyone,
and afterwards many are strong...

19
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:17,221
...at the broken places.
But those that will not break, it kills.

20
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:22,226
It kills the very good and the very gentle
and the very brave impartially. "

21
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:26,021
When he was good, he was very, very
good, and when he was bad, he was...

22
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:28,565
Hemingway was a monster.
He hated his mother...

23
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:32,236
...treated four wives miserably,
trashed his friends, grew paranoid...

24
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:34,863
...had breakdowns.
Like his father, killed himself.

25
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:38,992
Well, aside from all that, why are you
harassing me at 5: 13 a. m.?

26
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,954
I've been on the phone.
There's a rumor about Castro.

27
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,707
- There's always rumors about him.
- And at some point, they'll be true.

28
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:48,919
We've been laying groundwork
and making progress. Slow, granted.

29
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:52,130
- A year. Who's counting?
- If the talks we've cobbled together...

30
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:56,051
...with Cuba blow up, and this number
reaches zero, and we've got nothing...

31
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:59,054
- ...to show for it...
- For this, you're reading Hemingway?

32
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:01,557
- It's been 10 years.
- I remember.

33
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:03,934
In 30 days,
you read the complete works of.

34
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:07,813
It was hot. It was dry.
I had time on my hands.

35
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,315
Changed my life. Well...

36
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:14,027
- ...not Hemingway, exactly.
- Sierra Tucson can do that.

37
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,154
Sir.

38
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:19,283
I've got an idea.

39
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,624
- Charlie, have you seen Leo?
- He's gone.

40
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:30,586
- Gone?
- I saw him packing up a few hours ago.

41
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:33,547
- That would be night.
- Yeah, it was still dark out.

42
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:41,180
Seסor McGarry,
you made it successfully.

43
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,515
How was your trip?

44
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:45,767
The boat ride wasn't a lot of fun.

45
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:48,187
The weather, it's been bad.

46
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:50,814
Seemed like a good idea at the time.

47
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:56,111
Please, enter la finca de
Seסor Ernesto Hemingway.

48
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,658
Mr. President?

49
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:03,994
-7:53.
- It's 7:49.

50
00:04:04,203 --> 00:04:06,371
It's 7:53, and I had 7:53.

51
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:08,916
It doesn't reflect kindly
to what looks nothing...

52
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:12,085
- ...so much like trying to welsh on a bet.
- You requested...

53
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,755
...the EPA's ozone standard report.
Leo had it, but...

54
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:18,717
We've been expecting you. I had 7:53,
and Debbie's watch stopped.

55
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:21,803
A small wager about how long
it'd take before someone came...

56
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,640
- ...to ask where Leo might be.
- I don't understand.

57
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:28,727
Who knew he was such a Hemingway
fan that he'd go and visit his house?

58
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:32,022
The one in Idaho or the one
with the six-toe cats in Key West?

59
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:35,317
Good question, Charles Young.
You know, I forgot to ask.

60
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:56,672
You admire Ernesto?

61
00:04:56,839 --> 00:05:00,801
Very much. His writing. The best of it.

62
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:59,860
- The bug people are coming today.
- Where's, "Good morning," coffee, eggs?

63
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:03,322
There may be termites
in the White House.

64
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:05,657
- Hold the eggs.
- Two companies wanna do tests.

65
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:08,368
There could be some kind
of ant also. Carpenter ant.

66
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:11,580
There's fear it's related to the outbreak
of the woolly adelgid.

67
00:06:11,747 --> 00:06:12,789
The woolly what?

68
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:15,834
They're attacking hemlocks
in the Smoky Mountains and Virginia.

69
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:18,128
- They're closing in.
- You're making this up.

70
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:21,131
You gave me the briefing book.
The Roosevelt or Mural Room?

71
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:24,051
- Are they coming here to talk?
- They might munch around.

72
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:26,678
Munch? Just keep them far away
from me, thank you.

73
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:29,598
- They handle a large constituency.
- A small constituency.

74
00:06:29,765 --> 00:06:31,517
Well, size doesn't count.

75
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:33,769
Changing the subject,
any word from Leo?

76
00:06:33,936 --> 00:06:37,314
- Still in Hemingway-ville, far as I know.
- You know he read Hemingway?

77
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:40,859
History, books on fishing, thrillers,
Graham Greene, Charles McCarry.

78
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:43,987
- You never saw him reading Hemingway?
- Can't say I did.

79
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:49,535
He is 79 years old,
so it could be true.

80
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:51,578
- Where'd the report come from?
- Miami.

81
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:53,330
Well, that's reliable.

82
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:57,042
C.J., a report's come in the last hour
that Fidel Castro's seriously ill.

83
00:06:57,209 --> 00:06:59,545
- Has it been verified?
- We have nothing firm yet.

84
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:02,631
- It's from Miami.
- It could be accurate or wishful thinking.

85
00:07:02,798 --> 00:07:06,468
There's a lot of Chicken Little there,
or it could be a cover for something.

86
00:07:06,635 --> 00:07:10,305
There's a history of assassination
attempts, psyops forays, invasion plans.

87
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:11,807
I thought that had stopped.

88
00:07:11,974 --> 00:07:15,060
- The CIA did. We're talking years ago.
- It wasn't that long ago.

89
00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:18,897
- How long to nail down the information?
- A rabid Cuban-American community...

90
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:22,693
...could be involved. Old zealots, young
hotheads and a ton of agencies.

91
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:26,822
- FBI, DEA, NSA, NIA, INS...
- Which doesn't answer my question.

92
00:07:26,989 --> 00:07:30,659
We may never get a straight answer.
Miami, South Florida, it's Chinatown.

93
00:07:30,826 --> 00:07:32,995
I don't care. Pin it down.

94
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:39,084
By the way, I haven't collected
my winnings yet.

95
00:07:39,251 --> 00:07:41,545
Excuse me,
I think that would be my winnings.

96
00:07:41,712 --> 00:07:44,047
Sir, there's a rumor about Castro.

97
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:47,384
- Pull up the drawbridge for a minute.
- I'll sound the trumpets...

98
00:07:47,551 --> 00:07:51,555
...alert the gatekeeper, get the federal
government to attach your wages.

99
00:07:51,722 --> 00:07:53,182
Believe me, they already do.

100
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,643
Castro's always dying.

101
00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:00,856
He's dying from hypochondria,
or the exiles are trying to kill him...

102
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:03,150
...or the CIA's trying to kill him.

103
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:05,360
He collapsed a few years ago.
Same thing...

104
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:08,989
...endless rumors. Then he reappears
in fresh fatigues, trimmed beard...

105
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:12,159
...and launches into a speech
of such length and intensity...

106
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:14,620
...it would've put away
William Jennings Bryan.

107
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:18,665
NSA seems to think even if it is
a false alarm, it may be significant.

108
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,752
That's kind of what Leo said.

109
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:25,130
Why do I feel that there's something
going on with Leo...

110
00:08:25,297 --> 00:08:27,633
...besides Ernest Hemingway?

111
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:32,596
My apologies, C.J.,
but before you were chief of staff...

112
00:08:32,763 --> 00:08:36,391
...we began secret exploratory meetings
in Canada with representatives...

113
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:39,561
- ...of the Cuban government.
- Leo's gone to Canada?

114
00:08:40,646 --> 00:08:43,273
Actually, no. Cuba.

115
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,443
With, perhaps,
a thermometer and a stethoscope.

116
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:49,863
- And an offer, a new deal.
- And what does he say?

117
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:53,325
- I'm waiting to find out.
- Is it your plan to tell the rest of us...

118
00:08:53,492 --> 00:08:56,161
...who try and help you two
run this place?

119
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:04,419
One night in 1961, shortly after
the Bay of Pigs fiasco...

120
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:08,465
...President John F. Kennedy sent
Pierre Salinger out on a mission.

121
00:09:08,632 --> 00:09:11,844
"Come back with 1000
Cuban cigars by morning. "

122
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:15,472
Petit Upmanns is what the president
smoked, and before 8 a. m...

123
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:20,060
...the following morning, Salinger had
managed to corral 1200 of them.

124
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:22,855
JFK smiled, thanked him, lit one up.

125
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:27,693
Then he opened his desk drawer, pulled
out a long piece of paper and signed it.

126
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:31,572
It was a decree banning all Cuban
products from the United States.

127
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:35,701
And ever since then, we've had
an embargo against that mosquito...

128
00:09:35,868 --> 00:09:38,537
...of an island 90 miles away,
which has never worked...

129
00:09:38,704 --> 00:09:42,207
...while long before, we threw out
our anachronistic policies towards...

130
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:46,003
...Russia and China that are thousands
of miles away and far more complex.

131
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:49,506
If it becomes public, the reaction
in the Cuban-American community...

132
00:09:49,673 --> 00:09:53,177
- ...and on the right will be harsh.
- If the Cubans make accommodations...

133
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:55,846
- ...before that...
- The Florida primaries are coming.

134
00:09:56,013 --> 00:09:58,849
- If this comes out...
- If it does, we'll bring out shovels...

135
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:02,019
...and bury the Democratic candidates
in that little fiesta.

136
00:10:02,186 --> 00:10:04,104
You sure the country's ready for this?

137
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:07,232
Who knows who's gonna be
sitting here next?

138
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:09,443
Who knows what will happen
after Castro?

139
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:14,239
All I know for sure is there's a moment
here. Before I'm gone and he's gone...

140
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:17,492
...I am not gonna let it pass.

141
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:21,830
Oh, what a beautiful morning.
Oh, what a beautiful day.

142
00:10:21,997 --> 00:10:24,374
- You wanted to see me?
- That is highly improbable.

143
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,585
Been here three weeks.
Bring me in, coach.

144
00:10:26,752 --> 00:10:30,339
- All right. Know Senator Rafe Framhagen?
- I don't like this already.

145
00:10:30,506 --> 00:10:33,634
He called the president, Leo,
and then me. Guess what that means.

146
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,261
None of you wanted to talk to him,
which leaves me.

147
00:10:36,428 --> 00:10:39,056
- See? You do know the senator.
- What's not to know?

148
00:10:39,223 --> 00:10:42,851
Brilliant, bilious, impossible,
fires staffers for putting...

149
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:46,021
- ...paper clips backwards on briefs.
- Which way is backwards?

150
00:10:46,188 --> 00:10:49,191
- And that one other thing.
- I heard. Practically day and night.

151
00:10:49,358 --> 00:10:51,693
A wooden leg.
Passes out in his car, they say.

152
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,571
There you are, your assignment.
Godspeed and I'chaim.

153
00:10:57,824 --> 00:11:00,786
Oh, yeah, you got all the indications,
all right.

154
00:11:00,953 --> 00:11:03,622
- Indications of what?
- Subterranean termites.

155
00:11:03,789 --> 00:11:06,500
You know, these fellas outnumber us
a thousand to one.

156
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:12,089
Pile all them up and all us up, 10 times
the weight of all the folks in the world.

157
00:11:12,256 --> 00:11:15,759
Probably swarmed in through a crack
I saw in the foundation.

158
00:11:15,926 --> 00:11:18,595
- There was damage under a window.
- Swarmed? What window?

159
00:11:18,762 --> 00:11:21,932
- The one near that weird round room.
- The Oval Office?

160
00:11:22,099 --> 00:11:25,644
People appeared from every which way.
Never seen such a thing.

161
00:11:25,811 --> 00:11:29,106
- May be some evidence here.
- Hey, that's a 200-year-old mural.

162
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,276
Oh, yeah.

163
00:11:32,651 --> 00:11:35,487
- How many rooms you got here?
- One hundred and thirty-five.

164
00:11:35,654 --> 00:11:39,116
- I better start. This may take a while.
- What do you plan to do?

165
00:11:39,283 --> 00:11:42,202
Sentricon Termite Colony
Elimination System should do it.

166
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:44,955
- What does it involve?
- Dig holes, install stations...

167
00:11:45,122 --> 00:11:49,918
...drop in a few grams of Recruit II
and wait.

168
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:55,382
Okay, hold on one second.
I'm coming with you.

169
00:11:57,551 --> 00:12:00,053
Mr. Senator, Cliff Calley's here.

170
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:05,100
I've got a copy of his travel itinerary.

171
00:12:06,977 --> 00:12:09,438
The senator will see you now.

172
00:12:12,691 --> 00:12:15,360
- Thanks for taking care of that.
- You got it.

173
00:12:16,612 --> 00:12:19,031
Yeah, come on in, son.
What are you drinking?

174
00:12:19,198 --> 00:12:21,700
Diet Coke will be fine.

175
00:12:22,284 --> 00:12:25,787
Diet Coke. No, that's a Georgia drink.

176
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:28,499
In Florida, we drink orange juice.

177
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:31,877
Fresh. Shipped up every week.
Vitamin C.

178
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:36,006
We can inject it with something
if you like.

179
00:12:36,173 --> 00:12:38,967
- So they sent you.
- I have that privilege, senator.

180
00:12:39,134 --> 00:12:43,096
I remember you. Yeah, we breed
lawyers around here like minks.

181
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:45,807
Except we can't wear you
in the wintertime.

182
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:48,435
Well, here's Linda Lee.
Do me a favor, darling.

183
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:50,896
Would you freshen mine up too?

184
00:12:55,567 --> 00:12:58,737
That is a sashaying piece
of pulchritude, isn't it?

185
00:12:58,904 --> 00:13:03,909
Well, some people say that beauty
and brains don't go together.

186
00:13:04,535 --> 00:13:08,080
Well, I'm talking smart pulchritude
around here.

187
00:13:09,331 --> 00:13:12,251
- You know why you're here?
- There's the water table...

188
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:15,045
...in the Everglades,
the hurricane damage on the Gulf.

189
00:13:15,212 --> 00:13:16,964
They didn't tell you.

190
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:20,217
- I'm sorry, sir?
- Of course not.

191
00:13:20,926 --> 00:13:24,972
Send ignorance to combat truth, huh?
All right.

192
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:28,725
Now, you go back over there,
and you tell those people...

193
00:13:28,892 --> 00:13:31,436
...those people the senator graciously
tried to call...

194
00:13:31,603 --> 00:13:34,815
They didn't bother to call
the senator back. You tell them...

195
00:13:34,982 --> 00:13:37,693
...that I've heard it too, the rumor.

196
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,487
- What rumor?
- It's that Castro thing.

197
00:13:41,238 --> 00:13:44,366
And somebody knowledgeable
better come see me right quick.

198
00:13:44,658 --> 00:13:48,412
Back when Leo was chief of staff,
I could heckle him a little.

199
00:13:48,579 --> 00:13:51,665
We used to bend our elbows together
right in this room.

200
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:54,459
Down home, back when.

201
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:57,754
And now he's gone.

202
00:13:57,921 --> 00:14:00,549
- Probably only that NSA gal, huh?
- Gal?

203
00:14:00,716 --> 00:14:03,468
- You like repeating things, son?
- I'm getting good at it.

204
00:14:03,969 --> 00:14:07,139
You go back a couple of years,
get her out of those power suits...

205
00:14:07,306 --> 00:14:12,811
...back into the Sunshine State,
that would be some serious pulchritude.

206
00:14:14,104 --> 00:14:16,481
- But she's a buttoned-up babe now.
- Babe?

207
00:14:16,648 --> 00:14:19,234
- Bet she knows what's going on.
- You mean Kate Harper.

208
00:14:19,443 --> 00:14:21,904
Just a warning shot across the bow.

209
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:25,616
If some heroic new Cuban agenda
is being contemplated...

210
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:28,577
...by the Bartlet administration,
it's gonna backfire.

211
00:14:28,744 --> 00:14:32,456
Now, the House may have that bill that
waters down the embargo, but my...

212
00:14:32,623 --> 00:14:36,502
...Cuban-American constituents will
just raise bloody hell over that bill...

213
00:14:36,668 --> 00:14:40,255
...with Democrat candidates.
No such bill will see the light of day...

214
00:14:40,422 --> 00:14:42,925
...out of my commerce committee.
Did you get that...

215
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:45,511
...or do you wanna repeat some of it?

216
00:14:56,188 --> 00:14:57,523
C.J., Cliff's here.

217
00:14:57,689 --> 00:15:00,025
- What's next? That was fun.
- You saw the senator.

218
00:15:00,192 --> 00:15:02,194
- I'm full of vitamin C.
- Nothing stronger?

219
00:15:02,361 --> 00:15:04,696
- I think his juice was spiked.
- What did he want?

220
00:15:04,863 --> 00:15:06,448
- I'm not sure.
- You're not sure?

221
00:15:06,615 --> 00:15:09,952
This repeating thing must be contagious.
I assumed it was gonna be...

222
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:12,496
...a doddery senator who ran out
of paper clips...

223
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:15,165
...but it seemed to be
about Fidel Castro.

224
00:15:15,332 --> 00:15:17,376
- You got my attention.
- A rumor about his...

225
00:15:17,543 --> 00:15:19,253
Health. Whether he's alive or dead.

226
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:22,923
He was wondering if the White House
was behind it or up to something.

227
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:26,510
What is this city, just one big game
of telephone?

228
00:15:26,677 --> 00:15:29,555
- Anything I should know?
- There's a rumor about his health.

229
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:32,808
Yeah. One other odd thing.

230
00:15:32,975 --> 00:15:34,768
He suggested I talk to Kate Harper.

231
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:36,854
She's deputy national security advisor.

232
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,231
- I don't think that's it.
- Why is that?

233
00:15:39,398 --> 00:15:44,152
I can't exactly put my finger on it.
He indicated something other than that.

234
00:15:44,319 --> 00:15:46,029
More.

235
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:51,994
Margaret, get me Kate Harper.

236
00:15:52,536 --> 00:15:54,997
Let me guess, then.
Back to the bench for me?

237
00:15:55,164 --> 00:15:58,083
This is disgraceful.
I'm actually starting to like you.

238
00:16:01,545 --> 00:16:03,297
She's gone for the day.

239
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:04,923
- Toby!
- Toby!

240
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:08,343
Does the White House have knowledge
about Mr. Castro's health?

241
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:12,472
The last time we had firsthand
knowledge of Castro's health was 1959.

242
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:17,060
We heard he cancelled a rally to denounce
the U.S. on Malecףn Boulevard...

243
00:16:17,227 --> 00:16:20,439
...and several posters of him
have been removed from the capitol.

244
00:16:20,606 --> 00:16:23,859
Well, that could mean he's dead
or the communist government...

245
00:16:24,026 --> 00:16:27,696
...took down posters, planning to replace
them with more flattering photos...

246
00:16:27,863 --> 00:16:30,741
- ...like six years ago.
- The vice president said he voted...

247
00:16:30,908 --> 00:16:34,369
...for the embargo in 1996
and will continue to support it...

248
00:16:34,536 --> 00:16:37,372
...until this horrific dictatorship
is brought to its knees.

249
00:16:37,539 --> 00:16:41,043
- Is he speaking for the White House?
- He said that at a campaign rally.

250
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:44,046
If Castro is not in control,
how will the White House react?

251
00:16:44,213 --> 00:16:46,715
- We don't react to hypotheticals.
- Post Castro...

252
00:16:46,882 --> 00:16:49,510
...would we declassify Cuba
a terrorist state?

253
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:53,931
Only if they reacted to hypotheticals,
which they and I both don't. Yeah, you.

254
00:16:54,097 --> 00:16:57,976
Steve. The CIA issued a report
that Cuba has replaced...

255
00:16:58,143 --> 00:17:01,855
...East Asia as the destination
for pedophiles and sex tourists.

256
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:04,441
No, I can't issue you a visa.
Next question.

257
00:17:04,608 --> 00:17:08,487
Hoynes' campaign may be collapsing,
but Russell says he wouldn't rule out...

258
00:17:08,654 --> 00:17:12,324
...military intervention to secure
a democratic transition in Cuba.

259
00:17:12,491 --> 00:17:14,493
Yeah, they're campaigning in Florida.

260
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:17,663
What about Santos? With his
surprising victory in California...?

261
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:21,041
If you wanna cover the campaign,
take your questions to Florida.

262
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:23,126
- Steve, please.
- Here in Washington...

263
00:17:23,293 --> 00:17:25,712
- Thank you.
- ...Senator Framhagen said the worst...

264
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:29,132
...thing a president can do
is send mixed messages to Cuba.

265
00:17:37,933 --> 00:17:40,602
- She's a blond now.
- I wasn't gonna come.

266
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:44,398
And stand up a former CIA compatriot
after all these years?

267
00:17:44,565 --> 00:17:46,275
It's a time I'd like to forget.

268
00:17:46,441 --> 00:17:49,528
It was a time of "splendor in the grass,
glory in the flower...

269
00:17:49,695 --> 00:17:52,573
- ...but we will grieve not... "
- What do you want, Andy?

270
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:56,368
We're not running off the reservation
ops anymore. We've changed.

271
00:17:56,535 --> 00:17:59,454
- Second time I've heard that today.
- No more dirty tricks...

272
00:17:59,621 --> 00:18:02,958
...no more messing with elections,
even for Cabrera.

273
00:18:03,584 --> 00:18:07,254
- Still, our assignment's the same, Kate.
- You came here to tell me this?

274
00:18:07,421 --> 00:18:11,049
No. I just wanted to warn you guys
over there that it's a big mistake...

275
00:18:11,216 --> 00:18:13,302
...to dig into the Cuban tar pit
once again.

276
00:18:13,468 --> 00:18:15,554
- What are you talking about?
- Leo McGarry.

277
00:18:15,721 --> 00:18:17,973
- What about him?
- Can't touch down in Cuba...

278
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:21,435
...at his level. Whatever the precautions,
word will leak out.

279
00:18:21,602 --> 00:18:24,980
Everyone's on the take or has an agenda
or is an agent or a wannabe.

280
00:18:25,147 --> 00:18:27,232
I don't know anything about it.

281
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:30,986
- You played that beautifully.
- I played nothing.

282
00:18:31,153 --> 00:18:34,573
Whether you're lying or covering
because you can't or won't tell me...

283
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,825
...or you're telling the truth...

284
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:40,329
...the one thing we learned there,
you can't beat history.

285
00:18:40,496 --> 00:18:44,124
The Bartlet administration can't pull
this off. It's not gonna work.

286
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:47,002
The president will be hung out to dry.

287
00:18:47,377 --> 00:18:49,338
C.J., why didn't anyone tell me?

288
00:18:50,714 --> 00:18:52,341
- Excuse me?
- I'm the deputy NSA...

289
00:18:52,508 --> 00:18:54,510
...and I don't know
Leo McGarry's in Cuba?

290
00:18:54,676 --> 00:18:58,222
Yeah. How did you find out?

291
00:18:58,388 --> 00:19:00,891
It's 90 miles away.
It's like driving to Baltimore.

292
00:19:01,058 --> 00:19:04,561
- There's 3.5 million Cuban-Americans...
- Do you know Senator Framhagen?

293
00:19:04,728 --> 00:19:08,232
Florida. He is Florida. I knew him
when I was stationed there in '95.

294
00:19:08,398 --> 00:19:09,691
It was my first posting.

295
00:19:09,858 --> 00:19:12,236
Why would he say to ask you
about Castro's health?

296
00:19:12,402 --> 00:19:16,114
I don't know. Maybe because he
assumed I'd know about Leo's trip.

297
00:19:16,281 --> 00:19:18,325
- How close is your source?
- Very.

298
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:23,330
Look, C.J., we don't wanna get stuck
in the muck down there again.

299
00:19:26,959 --> 00:19:29,044
Hey, look who's back.

300
00:19:29,211 --> 00:19:31,338
She caught on, Leo.
I had to spill the beans.

301
00:19:31,547 --> 00:19:33,131
You talked to him? How was he?

302
00:19:33,298 --> 00:19:36,218
He's alive, and I think he might
finally be ready to deal...

303
00:19:36,385 --> 00:19:40,222
...and he can talk and talk. He agrees
on the need for further private...

304
00:19:40,389 --> 00:19:42,641
...unpublicized discussions bilaterally.

305
00:19:42,808 --> 00:19:46,603
The man's indefatigable. No wonder
he's held sway for coming on 50 years.

306
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:48,146
Still smoking cigars.

307
00:19:48,313 --> 00:19:51,483
I'm not sure he's ready to fight
for justice and the American way.

308
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:55,112
I am optimistic, but we've been
down this road before.

309
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:58,615
- I don't wanna fail again.
- It's a beginning, an opening.

310
00:19:58,782 --> 00:20:00,868
Just thank God he didn't ask
about baseball.

311
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:04,246
What he and I both think about it
could've blown the whole thing.

312
00:20:04,413 --> 00:20:06,957
He saw you pitch at the Orioles game.
He had pointers.

313
00:20:07,124 --> 00:20:09,585
- I'm sure.
- My fear is there seem to be rumors...

314
00:20:09,751 --> 00:20:11,753
...more rumors,
and rumors within rumors.

315
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:15,382
With Cuba, everyone seems to have
secrets, and they never stay that way.

316
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:18,510
Yeah, you're right. We don't need
to paint this guy as a hero.

317
00:20:18,677 --> 00:20:22,014
It's time to deal with him.
Let's put together a fail-safe response...

318
00:20:22,181 --> 00:20:24,808
...on how and what to announce
about Castro's health...

319
00:20:24,975 --> 00:20:28,478
...about Leo's trip, then sound out public
and congressional reaction...

320
00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:32,065
...and the candidates, what to do
about its impact on the primaries...

321
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:34,568
...and the general election
and Cuba's response.

322
00:20:34,735 --> 00:20:37,571
- How soon?
- How about the end of the day?

323
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:42,117
- Are they here yet?
- They're in your office.

324
00:20:42,284 --> 00:20:45,370
- Can you get me Kate Harper's file?
- I can't.

325
00:20:45,537 --> 00:20:48,165
- Why not?
- That's top-secret, above my level.

326
00:20:48,332 --> 00:20:51,460
- What do we have to do?
- Formal letter of request, signed by you.

327
00:20:51,627 --> 00:20:54,588
Write it. Forge my signature.
You can do the president's.

328
00:20:54,755 --> 00:20:57,758
But his is simple, just a sweeping
garland formation. Yours...

329
00:20:57,925 --> 00:20:59,676
- Mine is what?
- Angular...

330
00:20:59,843 --> 00:21:02,763
...aggressive.
I mean, your signature....

331
00:21:04,515 --> 00:21:08,560
See the baseline,
the unevenly distributed pressure...

332
00:21:08,727 --> 00:21:11,605
...some countermovement
to the natural flow...?

333
00:21:11,772 --> 00:21:13,857
- Which means?
- You're concealing something.

334
00:21:14,024 --> 00:21:16,735
What, are you a counterfeiter,
a handwriting analyst?

335
00:21:16,902 --> 00:21:18,862
My great uncle was,
after the Civil War.

336
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:21,698
He was a dashing man
with a mustache and one arm...

337
00:21:21,865 --> 00:21:25,911
By now, we could have written it, and
I could have signed it. Just go, do it.

338
00:21:26,787 --> 00:21:30,999
How's it going? Give me
a progress report. Cliff?

339
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:34,711
There's an opportunity to use the rumors
of Castro's health as deflection.

340
00:21:34,878 --> 00:21:37,714
Keep them coming. It's been
a Marx Brothers comedy anyway...

341
00:21:37,881 --> 00:21:41,134
...his illnesses and his 29 doctors
who claim he'll live forever.

342
00:21:41,301 --> 00:21:43,303
Yeah, I'm not sure how long
that will fly.

343
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:47,140
There's support in the House to curb
the embargo from blue and red states...

344
00:21:47,307 --> 00:21:50,143
...Midwestern Republicans ready
to jettison the trade part.

345
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:51,937
Cuba's an economic disaster area.

346
00:21:52,104 --> 00:21:55,357
- It needs American grain, meat...
- Can you believe this guy Cabrera?

347
00:21:55,524 --> 00:21:58,777
Introducing the vice president.
Congressman. Seventh, eighth term.

348
00:21:58,944 --> 00:22:02,447
Once ran an ad standing next to
a picture of himself with the caption:

349
00:22:02,614 --> 00:22:05,367
- "Convicted Felon. "
- Thanks for the lesson in local color.

350
00:22:05,534 --> 00:22:08,328
Keeps winning every two years,
saying the same thing.

351
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:11,957
Then he gets here, doesn't do
or say a damn thing.

352
00:22:12,124 --> 00:22:15,752
Did you call Josh and Donna? I wanna
take the temperature in the campaigns.

353
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:18,630
Somebody should make this
son of a bitch obsolete.

354
00:22:19,173 --> 00:22:22,801
Vice President Bob Russell, front-runner
of the Democratic presidential...

355
00:22:22,968 --> 00:22:25,804
- Has the exterminator been here?
- There was a man yesterday.

356
00:22:25,971 --> 00:22:28,265
The Sentricon Termite Colony
Elimination System?

357
00:22:28,432 --> 00:22:30,642
- Matter of fact, yes.
- We don't wanna quarrel...

358
00:22:30,809 --> 00:22:33,812
- ...with another company's product...
- It's not why we're here.

359
00:22:33,979 --> 00:22:36,398
We can talk about the individual
species like RIFA.

360
00:22:36,565 --> 00:22:38,567
- R-I-F-A?
- Red imported fire ant.

361
00:22:38,734 --> 00:22:42,070
We're members of IFAHI to thwart
the spread of RIFA. We have charts...

362
00:22:42,237 --> 00:22:46,158
...to show you of the spread
of the cinch bug...

363
00:22:46,325 --> 00:22:50,204
...the black-legged tick,
the viral-spreading mosquito...

364
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:55,000
...and this very year's infestation
by the Mormon cricket. Here.

365
00:22:55,167 --> 00:22:58,629
We're entomologists. While some control
is necessary, these others...

366
00:22:58,795 --> 00:23:01,924
...lost sight of how insects help
preserve diversity of life...

367
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:04,134
...and are essential
to the ecological web.

368
00:23:04,301 --> 00:23:08,096
Insects can spread disease, but they help
the study of how diseases are spread.

369
00:23:08,263 --> 00:23:11,517
The newest discovery is they
can play a crucial part in learning...

370
00:23:11,725 --> 00:23:14,436
- ...about our own history.
- Like this great White House.

371
00:23:14,603 --> 00:23:18,106
Think Abigail Adams and the War
of 1812, the burning of this building.

372
00:23:18,273 --> 00:23:21,318
Now, I'll wager we go into these walls,
and we will uncover...

373
00:23:21,485 --> 00:23:23,904
...all kinds of information
as yet unknown.

374
00:23:24,071 --> 00:23:27,658
That will help in solving crimes.
Forensic entomology, my special field...

375
00:23:27,825 --> 00:23:31,203
...is invaluable in measuring exposure
of the victim...

376
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:35,541
...whether Homo sapiens, Felis catus,
Canis familiaris...

377
00:23:35,707 --> 00:23:39,336
...to determine the time of death
and even the method of murder.

378
00:23:39,753 --> 00:23:41,421
You've gotta make a decision.

379
00:23:41,588 --> 00:23:46,468
Do you simply want to wipe out the
infestation or use these little pioneers...

380
00:23:46,635 --> 00:23:50,514
...to journey into our past
and unveil secrets for the first time?

381
00:24:06,071 --> 00:24:08,532
- You got it?
- They checked my clothes...

382
00:24:08,699 --> 00:24:12,369
...patted me down, searched my shoes,
my best shoes, practically x-rayed me.

383
00:24:12,536 --> 00:24:14,705
But they didn't do any
personality profile?

384
00:24:14,872 --> 00:24:17,708
- That didn't even occur to me.
- What were they thinking?

385
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:19,585
Here it is.

386
00:24:19,751 --> 00:24:21,753
Kate Harper.

387
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,256
- Close the door?
- Yes.

388
00:24:48,614 --> 00:24:51,742
- C.J.
- Charlie, tell me you have good news.

389
00:24:51,909 --> 00:24:55,287
- I'm not sure.
- Entertain me, enlighten me...

390
00:24:55,454 --> 00:24:57,581
...raise me up to the rooftops, please.

391
00:24:57,748 --> 00:25:00,125
I think this has more to do
with the lower depths.

392
00:25:00,292 --> 00:25:04,046
- It's coming back to me now. Bugs.
- Rhinotermitidae.

393
00:25:05,172 --> 00:25:07,883
- Is that the guy I saw with the gizmo?
- It could be.

394
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:10,093
- And he found...
- Rhinotermitidae.

395
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:14,181
- We're not tenting the White House.
- No, we're drilling walls.

396
00:25:14,348 --> 00:25:17,351
There's a group suggesting we
observe them before killing them.

397
00:25:17,518 --> 00:25:20,270
- The ones with the animatronic...?
- "Insectilatronic. "

398
00:25:20,437 --> 00:25:23,941
They say we can find out things
from termites about lumber conditions...

399
00:25:24,107 --> 00:25:26,818
...when the White House was built,
burned, rebuilt...

400
00:25:26,985 --> 00:25:30,322
...what presidents smoked,
ate, smelled like.

401
00:25:31,657 --> 00:25:33,659
This, Charlie, is not a tough choice.

402
00:25:33,826 --> 00:25:37,746
For once, our policy can be clean
and simple. Just kill the damn bugs.

403
00:25:41,542 --> 00:25:43,752
- Who is this?
- Toby. I wanted to ask you...

404
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:46,255
- ...about this Castro thing.
- I can't hear you.

405
00:25:46,421 --> 00:25:48,715
Donna, it's Toby. Toby Ziegler.

406
00:25:48,924 --> 00:25:52,427
- It's so crazy in here. Wait a minute.
- Hello?

407
00:25:52,594 --> 00:25:54,388
Toby?

408
00:25:56,139 --> 00:25:58,600
- Josh.
- Toby?

409
00:25:58,767 --> 00:26:02,187
- We're not talking to each other.
- Then what's making my phone ring?

410
00:26:02,354 --> 00:26:04,106
The thing's got a mind of its own.

411
00:26:04,314 --> 00:26:06,900
What's with Castro?
What's going on with that?

412
00:26:07,067 --> 00:26:11,113
- That's what I wanted to ask you.
- I can't hear you. It's crazy down here.

413
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:14,700
- It's Guatemala.
- Hello?

414
00:26:17,786 --> 00:26:20,831
- I lost you. How are you?
- What's going on down there, Donna?

415
00:26:20,998 --> 00:26:23,750
You won't believe it.
This state, it's unreal. It's like...

416
00:26:23,917 --> 00:26:26,420
- Guatemala?
- Hey, that's good. You a speechwriter?

417
00:26:26,587 --> 00:26:29,673
- What's the impact of this Castro thing?
- It's unbelievable.

418
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,677
Castro's become Che. Is he alive
or dead? He's wallpapering the primary.

419
00:26:33,844 --> 00:26:37,598
- Wait, what? Donna, hold on a second.
- Toby, I've got...

420
00:26:38,432 --> 00:26:39,892
Josh?

421
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,352
Josh? Josh.

422
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:45,647
C.J., I should apologize for you
not knowing about the Cuba trip.

423
00:26:45,814 --> 00:26:48,984
- Yes, you should.
- I thought it was worth the risk.

424
00:26:49,151 --> 00:26:51,862
- I still do.
- While you were gone, we all got calls...

425
00:26:52,029 --> 00:26:55,407
...from Rafe Framhagen. I sent Cliff over,
who said the senator...

426
00:26:55,574 --> 00:26:57,409
- ...may have been three sheets.
- Yeah?

427
00:26:57,576 --> 00:27:01,455
And he had questions about Kate Harper
and Cuba, as if she knew something.

428
00:27:01,622 --> 00:27:04,041
- Concerned? Why don't you pull her file.
- I did.

429
00:27:04,208 --> 00:27:06,210
This has been the long way
around to what?

430
00:27:06,376 --> 00:27:08,670
- A lot of blackout.
- Are we getting sidetracked?

431
00:27:08,837 --> 00:27:11,798
Kate Harper, Navy. Father, Navy.
Formerly CIA, wasn't it?

432
00:27:11,965 --> 00:27:16,220
Africa, blackout. Kosovo, blackout.
Iran, blackout. She got around.

433
00:27:17,054 --> 00:27:18,722
You're in it.

434
00:27:19,097 --> 00:27:21,767
- That's impossible.
- Turn the page.

435
00:27:25,229 --> 00:27:28,482
1995, Florida.

436
00:27:29,566 --> 00:27:32,236
But why is it in her file?

437
00:27:33,195 --> 00:27:37,324
- CIA must have been monitoring us.
- The rest was blacked out. What is it?

438
00:27:37,491 --> 00:27:40,828
We had a gathering of the Bay of Pigs
veterans from both sides...

439
00:27:40,994 --> 00:27:44,706
...for the first time,
and it was remarkable.

440
00:27:44,873 --> 00:27:49,628
These aging warriors, enemies, fellow
countrymen. And I had high hopes...

441
00:27:49,795 --> 00:27:52,965
...we were pulling together,
strand by strand, a dialogue with...

442
00:27:53,131 --> 00:27:55,801
- ...the Cuban-Americans and Cubans.
- I never heard this.

443
00:27:55,968 --> 00:27:59,763
There was also an election recount
underway. Congressman Cabrera.

444
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:02,641
- Yeah, I know the one.
- I was secretary of labor...

445
00:28:02,808 --> 00:28:07,145
...and Rafe Framhagen showed up,
and we started drinking.

446
00:28:08,272 --> 00:28:12,901
And I made a fool of myself.
Talk about three sheets to the wind.

447
00:28:13,068 --> 00:28:15,237
And when I got back, it was over.

448
00:28:15,404 --> 00:28:18,448
It had all fallen apart.
I should have never left.

449
00:28:18,615 --> 00:28:20,492
So I vowed then...

450
00:28:20,659 --> 00:28:24,329
...if there was ever a chance,
I'd put it back together.

451
00:28:32,171 --> 00:28:35,632
If we had a cigarette, a lighter
and a password, we'd be back 10 years.

452
00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:38,594
But it's so loud in here now,
I'd never hear the password.

453
00:28:39,136 --> 00:28:40,971
Don't you miss it...

454
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:44,850
- ...when you were undercover?
- I miss the excitement...

455
00:28:45,767 --> 00:28:48,520
...dressing up and down,
disappearing into character.

456
00:28:49,188 --> 00:28:51,190
And now look at you.

457
00:28:51,523 --> 00:28:55,903
Wearing suits and sitting
in meetings with amazing people.

458
00:28:56,069 --> 00:28:57,946
You've changed.

459
00:29:00,782 --> 00:29:03,827
I saw your ex-husband not long ago.
He's still down there.

460
00:29:03,994 --> 00:29:06,079
Why'd you call me again?

461
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:09,917
I wanted to apologize.

462
00:29:11,293 --> 00:29:12,920
For what?

463
00:29:14,338 --> 00:29:17,132
I knew back then what was going on.

464
00:29:17,841 --> 00:29:19,885
What it was doing to you.

465
00:29:20,844 --> 00:29:24,097
- I should've protected you better.
- Would've, should've.

466
00:29:24,264 --> 00:29:26,266
But it's... There's more to it than that.

467
00:29:26,433 --> 00:29:29,811
It's too late now, Andy.
It was too late then.

468
00:29:29,978 --> 00:29:32,481
I know. I know.

469
00:29:32,648 --> 00:29:35,651
Part of my 12 steps,
to make a fool of myself.

470
00:29:36,235 --> 00:29:39,404
Especially to those people who, maybe,
I made fools of.

471
00:29:44,034 --> 00:29:45,661
Thank you.

472
00:29:49,331 --> 00:29:51,542
They have all of it down there now,
Kate.

473
00:29:51,708 --> 00:29:55,087
Leo McGarry's trip, the deal
he's trying to make with Fidel.

474
00:29:55,254 --> 00:29:57,464
They're gonna break the story.

475
00:29:58,006 --> 00:30:00,467
- You're sure?
- Yeah.

476
00:30:00,634 --> 00:30:03,887
Don't get caught in this again
when it goes to hell.

477
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:10,018
Cuba. It scums everybody it touches.

478
00:30:26,577 --> 00:30:31,123
I'm walking back here thinking, "This is
a building I never thought I'd be in. "

479
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:33,625
Maybe it's a place you never quite
get used to.

480
00:30:33,792 --> 00:30:37,296
Once, my dad was gone with the
Pacific Fleet. My mom and I were left...

481
00:30:37,462 --> 00:30:39,006
...at the Key West Naval Base.

482
00:30:39,173 --> 00:30:41,216
There was no housing,
so for a while...

483
00:30:41,383 --> 00:30:44,970
...we lived in this boiling trailer
with no air conditioning.

484
00:30:45,262 --> 00:30:48,640
The wind shook it at night
and rocked me to sleep.

485
00:30:49,766 --> 00:30:52,102
It's a long way from here.

486
00:30:54,062 --> 00:30:56,565
Kate, what's going on?

487
00:30:58,066 --> 00:31:02,529
Tomorrow, Cuban-American factions
are going public with Leo's visit to Cuba.

488
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:15,083
Mr. President, it's clear that the news
of Leo's trip is going to break.

489
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:19,087
Don't know if it'll be audio, eyewitness,
photos, but we know it's coming.

490
00:31:19,254 --> 00:31:22,174
- CNN will get it, then the networks.
- A delightful prognosis.

491
00:31:22,341 --> 00:31:25,260
We can spin it. It was Cuban
representatives who initiated...

492
00:31:25,427 --> 00:31:28,430
...the conversations. We listened,
agreed to and accepted nothing.

493
00:31:28,597 --> 00:31:30,974
- I hate that.
- We must look at the consequences.

494
00:31:31,141 --> 00:31:34,061
The South Carolina and Florida primaries
are two weeks away.

495
00:31:34,228 --> 00:31:37,064
There will be no mercy
in the Cuban-American community.

496
00:31:37,231 --> 00:31:39,274
It won't go away
by the general election.

497
00:31:39,441 --> 00:31:42,277
- Russell will find a way.
- I can hear his sound bites already.

498
00:31:42,444 --> 00:31:45,906
Santos is a mystery. I don't know
what he'll do. Bet he doesn't either.

499
00:31:46,073 --> 00:31:48,116
Republican candidates?
Walken and Vinick?

500
00:31:48,283 --> 00:31:51,411
Vinick probably agrees with you,
but publicly, he'll step back...

501
00:31:51,578 --> 00:31:54,164
...and let Framhagen and Walken
put on war paint...

502
00:31:54,331 --> 00:31:58,126
- ...and gather around Little Bighorn.
- Wasn't the image I was hoping for.

503
00:31:58,836 --> 00:32:02,172
So Republicans and Democrats alike
will distance themselves...

504
00:32:02,339 --> 00:32:05,592
...from this act of madness
of the Bartlet administration.

505
00:32:06,051 --> 00:32:09,555
I think it's time we looked beyond
regrets and elections, sir.

506
00:32:10,764 --> 00:32:12,474
It's here, isn't it?

507
00:32:12,933 --> 00:32:14,810
Another cliff. Yes, sir.

508
00:32:14,977 --> 00:32:16,603
Toby?

509
00:32:17,437 --> 00:32:20,274
- Jump.
- C.J.

510
00:32:25,362 --> 00:32:28,240
Get me some airtime. I'll have
a few words with the nation.

511
00:32:28,407 --> 00:32:30,117
- When?
- As soon as possible.

512
00:32:30,284 --> 00:32:34,079
- We won't wait for the story to break.
- It's fair to let the candidates know.

513
00:32:34,246 --> 00:32:37,082
- I agree.
- Sir, the vice president is still waiting.

514
00:32:37,249 --> 00:32:40,252
Get Senator Vinick on the phone,
and then Congressman Santos.

515
00:32:40,419 --> 00:32:43,005
Then I'll see the vice president.

516
00:32:55,976 --> 00:32:57,728
Leo.

517
00:32:57,936 --> 00:33:00,564
Thanks for coming all the way
over here.

518
00:33:00,731 --> 00:33:02,900
Been a long time.

519
00:33:03,609 --> 00:33:06,028
Care to join me?

520
00:33:07,237 --> 00:33:10,991
No, I'm only fooling.
I know you don't any longer.

521
00:33:11,283 --> 00:33:14,661
Kind of wish more people
around here did.

522
00:33:15,287 --> 00:33:19,124
- What's Hemingway's word?
- "Utilize. " How'd you find out?

523
00:33:21,168 --> 00:33:26,715
Boat captain, deckhand, limo driver,
the gas attendant. Does it matter?

524
00:33:27,132 --> 00:33:30,636
It seems to me we got a lot more done
around here when we were utilizing.

525
00:33:30,802 --> 00:33:34,515
Got along better too.
Left and right, elephant and mule.

526
00:33:34,681 --> 00:33:38,060
These days, that's one place where
my point of view is the minority.

527
00:33:38,227 --> 00:33:41,813
Not the only place, senator.
Demographics are changing in your state.

528
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:45,442
You were Scotch, as I recall.
The good stuff. Just the way it poured.

529
00:33:45,609 --> 00:33:48,111
Younger Cuban-Americans don't care.

530
00:33:48,278 --> 00:33:52,282
The Cuba effect on Florida is going
the way of too much utilizing.

531
00:33:52,449 --> 00:33:55,744
So for the younger Cuban-Americans,
your solution is to have...

532
00:33:55,911 --> 00:33:59,289
...an old man with MS send another
old man who's had a heart attack...

533
00:33:59,456 --> 00:34:02,417
...to check on the health
of a third old man.

534
00:34:02,584 --> 00:34:06,547
A man who could be, should be,
and, God willing, soon will be dead.

535
00:34:07,631 --> 00:34:12,302
It's too late for the Bartlet administration
to go legacy shopping in Cuba, Leo.

536
00:34:12,469 --> 00:34:15,764
If I had come to you first,
what would you have said?

537
00:34:16,056 --> 00:34:17,724
No.

538
00:34:18,308 --> 00:34:20,644
We had to change the calculus,
or you'd bury us.

539
00:34:20,811 --> 00:34:24,481
- I am gonna bury you, Leo.
- After 45 years, it's time to admit...

540
00:34:24,648 --> 00:34:28,652
...the embargo isn't a reason for
or a solution to Cuba's tragic reality.

541
00:34:28,819 --> 00:34:32,281
The reason for Cuba's tragic reality
is Fidel Castro...

542
00:34:32,447 --> 00:34:36,243
...a vicious dictator who refuses
to allow free press, free elections...

543
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:40,956
...who jails even the slightest opposition.
You wanna legitimize his government.

544
00:34:41,123 --> 00:34:43,333
The good ship Legitimacy
sailed decades ago.

545
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,794
He's there,
has been for a very long time.

546
00:34:45,961 --> 00:34:48,714
The State Department lists Cuba
as a terrorist state.

547
00:34:48,881 --> 00:34:51,049
The State Department, Leo.

548
00:34:51,216 --> 00:34:55,512
The FBI just busted a Cuban
espionage operation, arrested 10 spies.

549
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:58,640
When we've tried reforming
a communist regime...

550
00:34:58,807 --> 00:35:02,102
...through embargo and severing
relations, we've always failed.

551
00:35:02,269 --> 00:35:05,397
When we sought change through
engagement and trade, we succeeded.

552
00:35:05,564 --> 00:35:09,276
What about the law, Leo?
Congress has codified the embargo.

553
00:35:09,443 --> 00:35:13,322
U.S. sanctions cannot be lifted
against Cuba until all political prisoners...

554
00:35:13,489 --> 00:35:17,534
...have been freed, until political parties
and labor unions have been legalized...

555
00:35:17,701 --> 00:35:19,703
...and free elections
have been scheduled.

556
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:22,623
No American president can overturn
the will of the people.

557
00:35:22,789 --> 00:35:26,251
It's not the will of the people.
It's a few loud and shrinking number...

558
00:35:26,418 --> 00:35:30,172
- ...of Cuban-Americans.
- Who came here stripped of everything.

559
00:35:30,339 --> 00:35:33,884
Who floated over here in little,
leaky boats, their kids in one hand...

560
00:35:34,051 --> 00:35:37,513
...and their dreams in another. And how
many of whom did we turn away...?

561
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:39,431
No one... No one's disputing that.

562
00:35:39,598 --> 00:35:41,767
And who have become
monumentally successful...

563
00:35:41,934 --> 00:35:44,853
...and too many of whom have become
Republicans, right, Leo?

564
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:48,315
But who we've also pandered to
for far too long.

565
00:35:48,941 --> 00:35:53,070
- I'm bringing a possible breakthrough.
- There's no such thing.

566
00:35:53,237 --> 00:35:57,574
We're starting with an executive order
to provide food, dollars through the U.N.

567
00:35:57,741 --> 00:36:00,911
The Department of Treasury liberalizing
business travel to Cuba...

568
00:36:01,078 --> 00:36:04,915
...working to involve Cuba in curbing
narco-trafficking and terrorism...

569
00:36:05,082 --> 00:36:07,334
...rather than treat them
as the problem.

570
00:36:07,501 --> 00:36:10,796
Now, there's the toothless,
gutless foreign policy...

571
00:36:10,963 --> 00:36:13,799
...we've all come to expect
from the Bartlet administration.

572
00:36:13,966 --> 00:36:17,511
Just give away the store, probably
billions of dollars, without getting...

573
00:36:17,678 --> 00:36:20,305
- ...a single concession in return.
- Extradition treaty.

574
00:36:20,472 --> 00:36:23,392
- He'll resign the extradition treaty?
- We're talking.

575
00:36:23,559 --> 00:36:26,937
You're talking?
Sure, he'll romance you...

576
00:36:27,104 --> 00:36:29,940
...he'll waltz you around
until he gets what he needs...

577
00:36:30,107 --> 00:36:34,820
- Maybe he's legacy shopping too.
- ...which is cash. He needs cash.

578
00:36:34,987 --> 00:36:37,906
That's why he's talking to you
in the first place.

579
00:36:38,073 --> 00:36:41,535
We finally got him where we want him,
on the verge of economic collapse.

580
00:36:41,743 --> 00:36:44,913
- That's what we said in 1963.
- He'll take your money, our money...

581
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:48,125
- ...and he'll renege.
- The rest of the world is already there.

582
00:36:48,292 --> 00:36:51,795
If we don't get our foot in, U.S.
business interests and your poor...

583
00:36:51,962 --> 00:36:54,381
...Cuban-Americans
will be left out in the cold.

584
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:57,801
Oh, that is really good.
The Bartlet administration...

585
00:36:57,968 --> 00:37:02,556
...is gonna save Castro for the sake
of American business? That's rich.

586
00:37:02,723 --> 00:37:06,393
So you're gonna go to war so a few
geriatrics can get their cabanas back?

587
00:37:06,852 --> 00:37:08,937
That's the trouble with our policy.

588
00:37:09,104 --> 00:37:12,733
Your rigor mortis stance is holding
hostage a Cuban-American community...

589
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:16,862
...you say you so love, and by proxy
it's held hostage the whole country.

590
00:37:18,238 --> 00:37:22,117
The world, time, has passed them by.
Castro won.

591
00:37:22,284 --> 00:37:24,786
Rafe, it's time.

592
00:37:24,953 --> 00:37:27,581
- It's long past time.
- Whatever dumb thing you do...

593
00:37:27,748 --> 00:37:31,960
...to prop up Castro will be reversed
next year, because if you do it...

594
00:37:32,127 --> 00:37:35,172
...you lose Florida in the election
and the presidency with it.

595
00:37:35,339 --> 00:37:38,634
You care more about American politics
than relieving the plight...

596
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,595
...of the Cuban people,
just like in 1995.

597
00:37:42,429 --> 00:37:44,014
Which year was that?

598
00:37:44,181 --> 00:37:47,768
The one where Cabrera won
the election recount, and it turned out...

599
00:37:47,935 --> 00:37:51,021
...his sister-in-law, who worked for you,
was the chief monitor.

600
00:37:51,188 --> 00:37:53,190
Cabrera did win that election.

601
00:37:53,357 --> 00:37:56,902
He was a convicted felon, and you knew
at the same time we were meeting...

602
00:37:57,069 --> 00:37:59,863
- ...talking with Castro's people.
- I came down there...

603
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:03,033
- ...and I remember we had a drink.
- We could have had a deal...

604
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,745
- ...ended all this insanity a decade ago.
- It was you who took me aside...

605
00:38:06,912 --> 00:38:11,291
...invited me for a drink. Now you're
gonna climb up on your high horse, huh?

606
00:38:11,792 --> 00:38:13,585
That's what I gotta live with.

607
00:38:14,795 --> 00:38:17,714
We were close once, back then.

608
00:38:18,799 --> 00:38:23,136
No, senator, we just drank back then.

609
00:38:24,304 --> 00:38:25,973
We were never close.

610
00:38:31,395 --> 00:38:33,730
- Hey.
- I was looking for you.

611
00:38:34,481 --> 00:38:37,985
President goes on the air any minute.
Thought I'd watch it down here.

612
00:38:38,152 --> 00:38:40,904
- Alone?
- Yeah.

613
00:38:46,285 --> 00:38:48,537
Cuba. Florida.

614
00:38:48,704 --> 00:38:53,125
You know a lot about them. You were
there in the '90s? 1995, maybe?

615
00:38:53,292 --> 00:38:55,669
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

616
00:38:55,878 --> 00:38:59,506
I was there only a few days...

617
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:03,969
...and I can't remember much at all.

618
00:39:04,469 --> 00:39:07,472
Led me to lock myself away
for 30 days, dry out.

619
00:39:07,639 --> 00:39:11,393
But I believed then, and I believe now,
this fight is worth it.

620
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,520
There's gonna be hell to pay tomorrow.

621
00:39:13,687 --> 00:39:17,399
If I'd only gotten it done 10 years ago,
Jed Bartlet could be spared it.

622
00:39:17,566 --> 00:39:20,152
The CIA would have never let
the embargo go away then.

623
00:39:20,777 --> 00:39:22,779
They're against ending it now.

624
00:39:23,739 --> 00:39:26,825
- What about you?
- I was in favor of it then.

625
00:39:26,992 --> 00:39:28,702
And now?

626
00:39:30,412 --> 00:39:32,080
I don't know.

627
00:39:32,247 --> 00:39:37,002
It's not about me. It's about
the president, what you want for him.

628
00:39:39,296 --> 00:39:40,964
And this is something.

629
00:39:42,257 --> 00:39:43,926
Yeah.

630
00:39:54,269 --> 00:39:56,230
Did we meet back then?

631
00:39:58,398 --> 00:39:59,858
Do you remember me?

632
00:40:03,821 --> 00:40:05,489
No.

633
00:40:08,617 --> 00:40:10,869
Do you remember me?

634
00:40:36,895 --> 00:40:40,190
- Where you going?
- My car, I think.

635
00:40:41,775 --> 00:40:44,611
- Okay, okay. Why don't I drive.
- No.

636
00:40:44,778 --> 00:40:47,197
Yeah, I think I'll drive.

637
00:40:48,532 --> 00:40:50,325
I'm fine.

638
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:53,745
There you go.

639
00:40:56,039 --> 00:40:58,667
Okay, okay, that's good.

640
00:41:09,178 --> 00:41:13,015
- Where are you going?
- Why not drive off into the sunset?

641
00:41:14,099 --> 00:41:17,811
- Yeah, I think we missed it.
- Something happen to your eye?

642
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:20,564
Well, you should see the other guy.

643
00:41:20,731 --> 00:41:24,610
- Where are you staying, at a hotel?
- On Calle Ocho. Got a suitcase.

644
00:41:24,776 --> 00:41:27,613
Pack it. Airport, if I can find it.

645
00:41:28,739 --> 00:41:32,284
- I'm gonna remember this.
- No, you won't.

646
00:41:32,951 --> 00:41:34,578
Yes, I will.

647
00:41:34,912 --> 00:41:38,373
No, but I will.

648
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:40,709
I'm gonna put my head down.

649
00:41:40,876 --> 00:41:44,588
Just for a moment. Thank you.

650
00:41:44,796 --> 00:41:47,674
My fellow Americans, in 1961...

651
00:41:47,841 --> 00:41:50,594
...President John F. Kennedy
bought some cigars.

652
00:41:50,761 --> 00:41:53,388
They happened to be
from a country called Cuba.

653
00:41:53,555 --> 00:41:56,308
And since that day,
nearly 45 years ago...

654
00:41:56,475 --> 00:41:59,144
...no American has been able
to do it again.

655
00:41:59,311 --> 00:42:01,563
And it's time for that to change.

656
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:05,776
This is not about cigars, of course, but
about our relationship with a country...

657
00:42:05,943 --> 00:42:08,320
...that is only 90 miles away.

658
00:42:08,487 --> 00:42:10,656
Change is not going to come easy.

659
00:42:10,823 --> 00:42:15,077
It won't be a change without passionate
discussion and disagreement...

660
00:42:15,244 --> 00:42:18,622
...but a change there can,
and will, and must be.

661
00:42:18,789 --> 00:42:21,834
The Cuban people and the
Cuban-American people have suffered...

662
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,712
...too long under intolerable
circumstances on both shores.

663
00:42:25,879 --> 00:42:29,842
My dream is that every one of
the hundreds of thousands of Cubans...

664
00:42:30,008 --> 00:42:34,429
...who draw lottery cards every year
to win one of the 20,000 slots...

665
00:42:34,596 --> 00:42:38,642
...allowing them to come to America
in search of a better life and freedom...

666
00:42:38,809 --> 00:42:42,938
...will finally have the chance to find
that freedom in their own country...

667
00:42:43,105 --> 00:42:46,650
...and that the 1.5 million
Cuban-Americans who have...

668
00:42:46,817 --> 00:42:49,736
...for so many decades,
longed to return to their homes...

669
00:42:49,903 --> 00:42:52,197
...will finally have the chance
to once again...

670
00:42:52,364 --> 00:42:55,492
...see the land of their fathers
and forefathers.

671
00:42:56,305 --> 00:43:56,291
