Previously on The West Wing:

2
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:12,132
Ever see Arnie Vinick campaign?
Up close?

3
00:00:12,307 --> 00:00:14,431
He'll go into those
high school gymnasiums...

4
00:00:14,602 --> 00:00:18,472
...in Iowa and New Hampshire
and blow them all away.

5
00:00:18,692 --> 00:00:21,149
Shake every hand in the joint,
kiss every baby...

6
00:00:21,363 --> 00:00:23,273
...hug every widow
on Social Security...

7
00:00:23,449 --> 00:00:28,244
. . .and sound smarter and more honest
than any Republican they've ever seen. . .

8
00:00:28,415 --> 00:00:30,409
. . .because he is.

9
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:36,795
The New Jersey polls closed
three minutes ago, 9 p.m. Eastern time.

10
00:00:36,971 --> 00:00:39,178
And although we have
no official results yet...

11
00:00:39,349 --> 00:00:43,017
... we can now report that our exit polls
indicate another huge win tonight...

12
00:00:43,189 --> 00:00:47,058
...for California Senator Arnold Vinick
in the Republican presidential primary.

13
00:00:47,237 --> 00:00:50,690
New Jersey's Democratic presidential
primary is still too close to call.

14
00:00:50,867 --> 00:00:53,027
Vice President Bob Russell
was the favorite...

15
00:00:53,204 --> 00:00:54,748
...in the final primary tonight.

16
00:00:54,916 --> 00:00:57,289
But our exit polls show
another very tight race...

17
00:00:57,461 --> 00:01:00,749
...between Russell and
Texas Congressman Matt Santos.

18
00:01:00,967 --> 00:01:03,210
Russell was hoping for a win
in New Jersey...

19
00:01:03,429 --> 00:01:05,470
... to prove a central campaign theme...

20
00:01:05,641 --> 00:01:09,178
... that he is the only Democrat
who can actually win in November.

21
00:01:09,355 --> 00:01:13,022
A Santos win tonight would be
another big upset for the congressman...

22
00:01:13,194 --> 00:01:16,316
...and leave him only about
100 delegates behind Russell...

23
00:01:16,533 --> 00:01:18,693
...and hurt the Russell
electability argument.

24
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:21,160
Neither will pick up
enough delegates tonight...

25
00:01:21,332 --> 00:01:22,875
... to get the nomination...

26
00:01:23,043 --> 00:01:26,710
...but a win in the final primary could
give Santos the momentum he needs...

27
00:01:26,883 --> 00:01:29,838
...going into the Democratic
National Convention next month.

28
00:01:30,054 --> 00:01:33,508
As expected, Senator Vinick now has
the Republican nomination locked up.

29
00:01:33,685 --> 00:01:36,058
Reverend Don Butler
was the last man standing...

30
00:01:36,231 --> 00:01:38,390
...against Vinick
in the Republican field.

31
00:01:38,568 --> 00:01:40,977
We're told that he'll concede
the race to Vinick...

32
00:01:41,155 --> 00:01:43,861
...in a speech at his campaign
headquarters in Virginia.

34
00:01:53,091 --> 00:01:57,340
I've got Senator Vinick here.
Just a second, Reverend Butler.

35
00:01:57,514 --> 00:01:59,093
Hi, Don.

36
00:01:59,267 --> 00:02:00,845
Thanks.

37
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,892
Hi, honey.

38
00:02:04,066 --> 00:02:07,733
Hey, Don, I'm gonna need your help
to bring the party together now.

39
00:02:07,906 --> 00:02:11,407
I'll wake you up early, and I'll help
you finish your homework then.

40
00:02:11,578 --> 00:02:13,572
-Okay. Love you.
-Yeah, sure.

41
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:15,831
No, anytime.
Whenever you want.

42
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:18,245
No, we'll clear the schedule for you.

43
00:02:22,512 --> 00:02:25,431
We gotta move fast on VP,
show Republicans coming together. . .

44
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,271
. . .while the Democrats are fighting
for the nomination.

45
00:02:28,438 --> 00:02:30,895
I love Don. He's a great guy.
An honorable guy.

46
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:32,646
He's the funniest on the list.

47
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,858
But he beat me up pretty bad
on abortion during the primaries.

48
00:02:36,075 --> 00:02:37,784
How's he gonna walk back from that?

49
00:02:37,953 --> 00:02:39,947
He doesn't have to.
We don't want him to.

50
00:02:40,123 --> 00:02:43,126
You agree on most issues
and respectfully disagree on a couple.

51
00:02:43,295 --> 00:02:44,956
-A couple.
-Sign of strength.

52
00:02:45,173 --> 00:02:46,502
Not looking for a yes man.

53
00:02:46,717 --> 00:02:50,302
Shows I'm looking for someone to help
with the party's conservative base.

54
00:02:50,473 --> 00:02:52,217
That too.

55
00:02:52,726 --> 00:02:54,471
We're in Butler headquarters.

56
00:02:54,646 --> 00:02:57,602
Don Butler, a heartbeat away
from the presidency?

57
00:02:57,776 --> 00:03:01,396
Thank you! Thank you.

58
00:03:02,074 --> 00:03:06,739
Well, you win some, you lose some.
And we won some primaries.

59
00:03:06,957 --> 00:03:09,284
But Senator Vinick won some more.

60
00:03:11,172 --> 00:03:12,501
No. No, no.

61
00:03:13,634 --> 00:03:20,175
Now is the time for this party to come
together and take back the White House.

62
00:03:20,937 --> 00:03:23,774
-Sounds very vice presidential to me.
-He's a good soldier.

63
00:03:23,942 --> 00:03:27,562
I want to thank the Butler Brigade.

64
00:03:27,781 --> 00:03:31,235
Secret Service wants you
to start moving down to the ballroom.

65
00:03:31,412 --> 00:03:32,872
Sheila.

66
00:03:33,874 --> 00:03:35,334
Thanks.

67
00:03:38,256 --> 00:03:41,508
-As was anticipated, Senator Vinick....
-It's Vinick.

68
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:43,425
Yeah.

69
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:47,051
We go live now as he addresses
his supporters.

70
00:04:01,167 --> 00:04:02,960
Thank you.

71
00:04:04,631 --> 00:04:06,126
Thank you very much.

72
00:04:06,676 --> 00:04:09,465
We got nobody who can beat him.

73
00:04:09,681 --> 00:04:13,218
-Vinick! Vinick! Vinick!
-Thank you.

74
00:04:13,395 --> 00:04:15,542
We did it!

75
00:05:03,922 --> 00:05:06,877
Senator Arnold Vinick has the
Republican nomination locked up.

76
00:05:07,051 --> 00:05:10,920
But they've been counting votes all
night, and we still don 't have a winner...

77
00:05:11,098 --> 00:05:13,803
...in the New Jersey Democratic
presidential primary.

78
00:05:13,977 --> 00:05:17,512
The lead has been shifting. With
97 percent of the precincts reporting...

79
00:05:17,731 --> 00:05:21,600
... Congressman Matt Santos has a lead
of less than 1000 votes...

80
00:05:21,778 --> 00:05:23,606
...over Vice President Bob Russell.

81
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:25,573
What are you doing?

82
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:28,614
-You were sleeping.
-They're still counting New Jersey.

83
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:30,365
-So what?
-So what?

84
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:31,915
It doesn't matter who wins.

85
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:35,001
No one's gonna have enough delegates
for the nomination.

86
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:37,460
Come on, wake up
and smell the chaos.

87
00:05:40,135 --> 00:05:43,719
No candidate will win enough delegates
to secure the Democratic nomination.

88
00:05:43,932 --> 00:05:47,017
-I promised Tim I'd do the show.
-You will, just not this week.

89
00:05:47,186 --> 00:05:48,515
The more you're on TV now. . .

90
00:05:48,688 --> 00:05:51,096
. . .the less they cover the
Democratic Party mess.

91
00:05:51,274 --> 00:05:52,935
That's the story we want this week.

92
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:55,898
-I'll pull press events off the schedule.
-Fundraisers?

93
00:05:56,072 --> 00:05:58,231
-No press allowed.
-Excuse me, Senator Vinick.

94
00:05:58,408 --> 00:05:59,868
Don't take too many questions.

95
00:06:00,036 --> 00:06:01,910
Senator, when are you
gonna choose a VP?

96
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,539
Hadn't really thought
about it.

97
00:06:03,707 --> 00:06:05,581
Would you rather face
Russell or Santos?

98
00:06:05,751 --> 00:06:07,661
I'm in no hurry to face anyone.

99
00:06:07,837 --> 00:06:10,839
Tell the Democrats they can
take their time figuring it out.

100
00:06:11,008 --> 00:06:12,882
Do you think your lead in California. . .

101
00:06:13,052 --> 00:06:15,259
. . .gives you the lock
on the Electoral College?

102
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:18,136
I have a lock on the
Republican nomination, nothing else.

103
00:06:18,351 --> 00:06:21,637
I won't take my state for granted.
I'll work hard to win California.

104
00:06:21,855 --> 00:06:23,848
-Work hard to win every state.
-Thank you.

105
00:06:24,025 --> 00:06:27,858
Senator, how can you cut taxes
and cut the deficit at the same time?

106
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:29,441
I have a two-for-one plan.

107
00:06:29,615 --> 00:06:33,115
For every dollar we cut taxes,
we're cutting spending by $2.

108
00:06:33,286 --> 00:06:35,078
Drastic spending cuts in vital areas?

109
00:06:35,247 --> 00:06:39,163
You call it drastic, I call it necessary.
I'm for good government we can afford.

110
00:06:39,378 --> 00:06:41,371
-No more, no less.
-That's all. Thank you.

111
00:06:41,547 --> 00:06:44,584
What do you think of the deal
the city council's negotiating. . .

112
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,797
-. . .to keep baseball in the city?
-Ridiculous. Teams should pay.

113
00:06:47,972 --> 00:06:51,971
They can pay 80 million for a shortstop
but can't pay for their own stadiums?

114
00:06:52,144 --> 00:06:54,102
-Come on.
-Okay, we're done. Thank you.

115
00:06:54,272 --> 00:06:55,766
-Thank you.
-Senator, excuse me.

116
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:58,984
Thanks. Now I'm gonna have
to give back my tickets to the game.

117
00:06:59,153 --> 00:07:02,357
-I had to pull a lot of strings to get them.
-Did you pay for them?

118
00:07:02,532 --> 00:07:05,404
-Of course.
-Forget about it. They're your seats.

119
00:07:05,578 --> 00:07:09,279
-Where are we sitting?
-No way. I only got two.

120
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:13,368
-The kids fighting over who gets to go?
-Holly's got a biology test the next day.

121
00:07:13,546 --> 00:07:16,501
-Brendan's got practice, so. . . .
-Tell Tina to bring her glove.

122
00:07:16,675 --> 00:07:18,550
I want her to catch a foul ball for me.

123
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,887
Yes, Madam Secretary,
I have your memo.

124
00:07:24,102 --> 00:07:25,644
I see.

125
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:27,604
Yeah, I unders--

126
00:07:28,065 --> 00:07:30,058
I'll give it to the president. Right.

127
00:07:31,361 --> 00:07:34,861
I understood the debt-ceiling situation
perfectly before I talked to her.

128
00:07:35,032 --> 00:07:37,738
Can we have a treasury secretary
who speaks English?

129
00:07:37,911 --> 00:07:39,240
-It's Santos.
-By how much?

130
00:07:39,413 --> 00:07:41,952
-Couple thousand votes.
-Santos won New Jersey?

131
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:43,453
-Yeah.
-How many delegates?

132
00:07:43,627 --> 00:07:45,999
A press release on raising
the debt ceiling?

133
00:07:46,172 --> 00:07:48,746
-Because I don't understand it.
-No press release.

134
00:07:48,925 --> 00:07:50,254
When's the vote scheduled?

135
00:07:50,427 --> 00:07:53,215
Treasury thinks debt interest
will hit the limit tomorrow.

136
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:55,347
They want the vote right now.

137
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:58,097
-Which, of course, is a ridiculous idea.
-Of course.

138
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:00,976
-The leadership wants it last minute.
-How crazy is that?

139
00:08:01,149 --> 00:08:04,649
They like to schedule at the last minute,
when we're about to default.

140
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:08,071
That way, it's too dangerous
for any senator to try to stop it.

141
00:08:08,241 --> 00:08:10,864
Leaves time for a few speeches
about how awful it is. . .

142
00:08:11,037 --> 00:08:14,703
. . .we maxed out the national credit card,
a vote to raise the card's limit.

143
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:17,497
It's a one-sentence bill.
Change the seven to an eight.

144
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:19,544
-Trillion.
-Yeah, trillion.

145
00:08:19,714 --> 00:08:23,131
Treasury wants the president to read
a 20-page memo on a short bill?

146
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:26,138
-They run the worst-case scenario.
-In case it doesn't pass?

147
00:08:26,306 --> 00:08:28,430
The immediate collapse
of the U.S. economy. . .

148
00:08:28,601 --> 00:08:32,185
. . .Japan sinking into the sea,
followed by a worldwide depression. . .

149
00:08:32,356 --> 00:08:34,729
. . .no mortal can imagine.
Followed by week two.

150
00:08:34,942 --> 00:08:37,481
So this debt thing is routine
or the end of the world?

151
00:08:37,696 --> 00:08:41,066
-Both.
-Okay. That's it. Thanks, everybody.

152
00:08:45,498 --> 00:08:48,120
-We gotta do something.
-It's not the end of the world.

153
00:08:48,293 --> 00:08:51,544
-Just the end of a lifestyle.
-It's the end of the Democratic Party.

154
00:08:51,714 --> 00:08:54,122
We're facing a Republican
who can win California. . .

155
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,753
. . .and maybe 49 other states,
and who do we have? We have nobody.

156
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:00,007
Going into a convention
without a candidate.

157
00:09:00,183 --> 00:09:03,719
See Broder's column today? He says
this is great for the Democratic Party.

158
00:09:03,896 --> 00:09:05,225
Yeah, he's on drugs.

159
00:09:05,398 --> 00:09:07,605
Conventions used to be
about picking a nominee.

160
00:09:07,776 --> 00:09:10,184
-Suspense.
-The networks are gonna love it.

161
00:09:10,363 --> 00:09:11,905
-They'll cover everything.
-Yeah.

162
00:09:12,115 --> 00:09:15,283
Instead of predictable emptiness,
all hell's gonna break loose.

163
00:09:16,537 --> 00:09:18,530
The good news is, the Dems
are in disarray.

164
00:09:18,707 --> 00:09:20,783
Bad news is we don't know
who we're against.

165
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:25,089
-Santos, if we're lucky.
-Santos could be tougher than Russell.

166
00:09:25,257 --> 00:09:27,380
Santos couldn't even carry
his own his state.

167
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,880
Santos won the big states.

168
00:09:29,053 --> 00:09:31,296
Russell's weak in Northeastern
urban women. . .

169
00:09:31,515 --> 00:09:34,137
. . .suburban men, all minorities,
not to mention--

170
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:36,766
Okay. How much do we need
for the ground game?

171
00:09:36,938 --> 00:09:39,145
We can't plan till we know
who we're against.

172
00:09:39,316 --> 00:09:41,226
They're both strong in different states.

173
00:09:41,402 --> 00:09:46,398
We can't wait till after the Democratic
Convention to build an organization.

174
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:48,488
Yeah.

175
00:09:49,621 --> 00:09:53,038
Okay. Royce is here.

176
00:09:53,209 --> 00:09:55,368
-Where?
-Reception, waiting to see you.

177
00:09:55,546 --> 00:09:57,622
The majority leader
is coming to my office?

178
00:09:57,798 --> 00:10:00,088
Guess he wants to be
first in line for VP.

179
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:03,178
Oh, boy. Here we go.

180
00:10:03,514 --> 00:10:05,554
-Okay, bring him in.
-Right.

181
00:10:09,313 --> 00:10:11,887
Mr. Leader.

182
00:10:12,108 --> 00:10:15,858
Arnie. I just wanna be the first guy
in the building to say congratulations.

183
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:17,858
Didn't have to come all the way here.

184
00:10:18,033 --> 00:10:21,367
Cut it out, Arnie. You're the real leader
of this party now.

185
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:23,614
I just want you to know
I'm at your service.

186
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,949
Whatever you need me to do,
just say the word.

187
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:28,665
Thanks, Bob. Have a seat.

188
00:10:32,468 --> 00:10:36,514
First of all, I can be very helpful
with fundraising.

189
00:10:36,682 --> 00:10:41,012
I have the highest yielding
direct mail list in town. Second. . . .

190
00:10:41,187 --> 00:10:43,062
How many delegates
does Santos have?

191
00:10:43,232 --> 00:10:46,602
-1599.
-So Russell's only 80 ahead.

192
00:10:46,778 --> 00:10:49,649
Seventy-eight. Russell's got 1677.

193
00:10:49,823 --> 00:10:53,110
-And Hoynes has 956.
-What's the magic number?

194
00:10:53,286 --> 00:10:56,371
2162 gets you the nomination.

195
00:10:56,582 --> 00:10:57,958
Hoynes doesn't have a chance.

196
00:10:58,126 --> 00:11:00,333
He's betting
on the second or third ballot. . .

197
00:11:00,504 --> 00:11:03,042
. . .the delegates will get shaky
about these newcomers.

198
00:11:03,257 --> 00:11:04,752
Move to the guy they've known.

199
00:11:04,926 --> 00:11:08,261
Before the convention, the party
will go through four weeks of chaos.

200
00:11:08,431 --> 00:11:12,595
Fighting over who will be on the platform
committee, what will be in the platform.

201
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:15,557
-Who gets to speak on what night.
-Uncommitted delegates.

202
00:11:15,732 --> 00:11:18,686
Convincing committed delegates
to switch on the second ballot.

203
00:11:18,861 --> 00:11:21,697
While Vinick is looking
more presidential every day.

204
00:11:22,323 --> 00:11:24,815
Mr. President,
until we have a nominee. . .

205
00:11:24,994 --> 00:11:27,319
. . .you are still the head of this party.

206
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:32,246
Okay. Let's get Russell
and Santos in here.

207
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,709
-And Hoynes?
-No. C.J.'s right.

208
00:11:34,881 --> 00:11:37,455
-He doesn't have a chance.
-You'll broker a deal?

209
00:11:37,635 --> 00:11:39,924
They're not ready for that.
Just a photo op.

210
00:11:40,096 --> 00:11:43,431
Remind people that we still know
something about running the country.

211
00:11:43,642 --> 00:11:46,134
Maybe a little less
about running a party.

212
00:11:47,063 --> 00:11:48,772
I don't feel comfortable about this.

213
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:51,433
Everybody does it at this stage.
Bring in new people.

214
00:11:51,611 --> 00:11:55,195
Yeah, but a Democrat? I spent
the last six months fighting this idea. . .

215
00:11:55,366 --> 00:11:58,700
. . .that somehow I'm not a real
Republican, then I bring in a Democrat?

216
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:01,742
One step at a time. I'm just saying
we should meet with him.

217
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:05,452
Governor Baker vouches that we can
trust him not to leak the meeting.

218
00:12:05,671 --> 00:12:10,583
-I don't know.
-He says he has a plan to win 50 states.

219
00:12:11,053 --> 00:12:12,962
Okay, bring him in.

220
00:12:18,187 --> 00:12:19,765
Bruno.

221
00:12:20,231 --> 00:12:21,891
Come on in.

222
00:12:23,277 --> 00:12:26,943
-Congratulations, senator.
-Thank you, Bruno. Have a seat.

223
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:32,486
-Fifty states, huh?
-Sound crazy to you?

224
00:12:32,664 --> 00:12:34,823
Well, it did get my attention.

225
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,213
Republicans have won 49 states twice
in the last 30 years.

226
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:40,709
They've never had anybody. . .

227
00:12:40,882 --> 00:12:43,635
. . .with as much independent
and cross-party appeal as you.

228
00:12:43,803 --> 00:12:47,504
I can't plan a 50-state campaign before
we know who I'm running against.

229
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:51,059
Who told you that? Because if it is
somebody on your campaign staff. . .

230
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:53,139
. . .you gotta fire that person right now.

231
00:12:53,357 --> 00:12:55,683
I would run you from today
to Election Day. . .

232
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,983
. . .without ever mentioning
your opponent.

233
00:12:58,155 --> 00:13:02,865
This campaign should be all about you,
the reasons you should be president.

234
00:13:03,036 --> 00:13:07,948
And those reasons are exactly
where 60 percent of the voters are.

235
00:13:08,167 --> 00:13:11,335
Pro-choice, anti-partial birth,
pro-death penalty. . .

236
00:13:11,547 --> 00:13:14,751
. . .anti-tax, pro-environment
and pro-business. . .

237
00:13:14,968 --> 00:13:17,127
. . .pro-balanced budget.
I could go on and on.

238
00:13:17,304 --> 00:13:18,633
Oh, please do.

239
00:13:18,806 --> 00:13:22,425
You're in a unique position to run
a completely positive campaign. . .

240
00:13:22,603 --> 00:13:27,811
. . .because most of the country
agrees with you on most of the issues.

241
00:13:27,984 --> 00:13:31,853
The only thing you could do
to ruin that now. . .

242
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:34,570
. . .is to pick Don Butler as your VP.

243
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:39,241
So you tell me you're not even
thinking about that, I'll shut up.

244
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:43,165
You've seen the papers. Everybody says
Butler's on the short list.

245
00:13:43,463 --> 00:13:47,296
Every talking head on TV says
that is brilliant. . .

246
00:13:47,468 --> 00:13:51,798
. . .guarantees you a win, which it does,
but not a big win.

247
00:13:52,015 --> 00:13:55,516
I have to reach out
to the pro-life Republican base.

248
00:13:55,687 --> 00:13:58,523
We have to give them some reason
to come to the polls.

249
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:00,434
I'm never gonna be that reason.

250
00:14:00,651 --> 00:14:02,561
There are many pro-life Republicans. . .

251
00:14:02,737 --> 00:14:05,110
. . .who are more qualified for VP
than Don Butler.

252
00:14:06,951 --> 00:14:09,277
What do you know
about Republican politics?

253
00:14:09,496 --> 00:14:12,498
-I don't care about Republican politics.
-Well, that I believe.

254
00:14:12,667 --> 00:14:15,419
I don't care about
Democratic politics, either.

255
00:14:15,629 --> 00:14:19,544
Okay, I do care about the Democrats.

256
00:14:20,051 --> 00:14:22,673
Look, they don't know it yet.

257
00:14:22,846 --> 00:14:25,005
You are the best thing
to ever happen to them.

258
00:14:25,183 --> 00:14:27,935
You're moving the Republicans
away from the right wing.

259
00:14:28,103 --> 00:14:30,511
You're not saying Democrats
are not patriotic.

260
00:14:30,731 --> 00:14:33,223
You're just saying
that your approach is better.

261
00:14:33,402 --> 00:14:37,864
You are making politics
a fair fight again.

262
00:14:38,491 --> 00:14:40,116
What?

263
00:14:40,703 --> 00:14:42,446
You think I'm a spy?

264
00:14:42,622 --> 00:14:45,030
I snuck in here,
I'm trying to steer you wrong?

265
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,959
The thought has crossed my mind.

266
00:14:47,169 --> 00:14:51,500
I have spent the last 20 years
ripping this country apart.

267
00:14:52,134 --> 00:14:56,382
Finding wedge issues
to separate the voters.

268
00:14:56,932 --> 00:15:01,346
You don't have to do that to win.
Not this time.

269
00:15:01,521 --> 00:15:06,730
You do this right, you can do
a lot more than win.

270
00:15:06,903 --> 00:15:10,854
You can stop using politics
to divide this country.

271
00:15:11,242 --> 00:15:14,861
You can show us how much we agree,
instead of how much we disagree.

272
00:15:15,038 --> 00:15:19,666
You can put this country
back together.

273
00:15:28,764 --> 00:15:31,849
-Please, C.J., it's a terrible idea.
-It's the president's idea.

274
00:15:32,018 --> 00:15:34,510
Can't you see it's an insult
to the vice president. . .

275
00:15:34,688 --> 00:15:37,441
-. . .to bring them into his White House?
-His White House?

276
00:15:37,609 --> 00:15:38,938
The VP belongs here.

277
00:15:39,111 --> 00:15:42,362
The president is the party head.
He won't let it crash and burn now.

278
00:15:42,532 --> 00:15:44,110
This is his solution? A photo op?

279
00:15:44,284 --> 00:15:48,199
Remind voters we're good at running
the country, which the VP has a role in.

280
00:15:48,373 --> 00:15:50,864
Show everyone that the party
isn't in meltdown mode.

281
00:15:51,043 --> 00:15:54,413
Okay. Russell has to have a separate
photo op alone with the president.

282
00:15:54,589 --> 00:15:57,128
A shot of them discussing,
you know, affairs of state.

283
00:15:57,301 --> 00:16:00,302
No. We do this the president's way.
It'll be good for everyone.

284
00:16:00,471 --> 00:16:01,847
Russell can beat Vinick.

285
00:16:02,015 --> 00:16:04,471
He won twice as many states
and the most delegates.

286
00:16:04,643 --> 00:16:06,138
Santos has the momentum.

287
00:16:06,312 --> 00:16:09,516
Because he won New Jersey
by 1 percent? Russell is our best hope.

288
00:16:09,692 --> 00:16:11,934
He's been a good vice president.

289
00:16:12,111 --> 00:16:13,820
To bring the party together. . .

290
00:16:13,989 --> 00:16:19,067
-. . .he should get behind Russell now.
-Ten a.m. tomorrow morning in the Oval.

291
00:16:21,123 --> 00:16:24,160
Most of the donors tonight are
from the pharmaceutical industry.

292
00:16:24,335 --> 00:16:25,996
You got the list?

293
00:16:26,171 --> 00:16:29,873
I'll give them my "how American
medicine saves the world" speech.

294
00:16:30,051 --> 00:16:33,385
Protect the patents, no price controls,
no Canadian imports.

295
00:16:33,555 --> 00:16:37,471
We got a lot of the energy industry
people tonight too.

296
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:44,808
Yeah. When? Wait. Hold on a second.

297
00:16:46,906 --> 00:16:48,733
Hi, sweetie.

298
00:16:50,577 --> 00:16:54,197
-The area of a parallelogram is. . . .
-Length times width.

299
00:16:54,374 --> 00:16:57,541
Length times width.
Same as a rectangle?

300
00:16:57,711 --> 00:17:01,295
Yes, that's the same as a rectangle.
No problem.

301
00:17:01,466 --> 00:17:03,625
Love you.

302
00:17:05,138 --> 00:17:06,965
Okay, I'm back.

303
00:17:09,518 --> 00:17:12,224
That's great. Thanks.

304
00:17:14,441 --> 00:17:17,894
You're meeting with the Reverend Butler
first thing in the morning.

305
00:17:18,488 --> 00:17:21,940
Do you think Bruno's right? That we
shouldn't put Butler on the ticket?

306
00:17:22,159 --> 00:17:24,865
Maybe. But we need Butler,
one way or the other.

307
00:17:25,038 --> 00:17:28,622
If he's not on the ticket, we still need
a strong endorsement from him.

308
00:17:28,835 --> 00:17:31,326
Now, these energy types
that will be there tonight. . .

309
00:17:31,546 --> 00:17:34,881
. . .they wanna hear how you're
voting on the energy-deregulation bill.

310
00:17:35,093 --> 00:17:37,584
Well, it depends on what's in it
when it comes out.

311
00:17:37,804 --> 00:17:41,174
It's a very bad message to the
big contributors if you vote against it.

312
00:17:41,392 --> 00:17:44,145
Hey, if you can't drink their booze,
take their money. . .

313
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:47,599
. . .and then vote against them,
you don't belong in this business.

314
00:18:04,046 --> 00:18:06,040
Hey, glad you could both make it.

315
00:18:06,216 --> 00:18:07,924
-Mr. President.
-Mr. President.

316
00:18:08,093 --> 00:18:10,632
Annabeth, you can bring
in the thundering herd.

317
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:13,883
Sit down.

318
00:18:22,195 --> 00:18:24,188
It's good to finally meet you,
congressman.

319
00:18:24,406 --> 00:18:26,316
-It's an honor.
-Congratulations.

320
00:18:26,492 --> 00:18:28,948
-Thank you, sir.
-Bob, thanks for doing this.

321
00:18:29,162 --> 00:18:31,036
A pleasure, Mr. President.

322
00:18:34,836 --> 00:18:36,414
All right, that's it. Thank you.

323
00:18:36,588 --> 00:18:37,917
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

324
00:18:56,155 --> 00:18:57,697
All right, listen up.

325
00:18:57,907 --> 00:18:59,616
This is a tough situation for you.

326
00:18:59,784 --> 00:19:01,196
I understand that.

327
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:04,075
The press is geared up
for its favorite blood sport. . .

328
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:06,330
. . .Democrats attacking each other.

329
00:19:06,543 --> 00:19:09,461
And I know that's what some people
are gonna tell you to do.

330
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:11,374
But we cannot allow that to happen.

331
00:19:11,591 --> 00:19:14,427
That would just hand over the election
to the Republicans.

332
00:19:14,595 --> 00:19:16,802
One of you is gonna be our nominee. . .

333
00:19:17,015 --> 00:19:21,180
. . .so I want both of you to start acting
like the nominee right now.

334
00:19:21,354 --> 00:19:23,928
No attacks on each other.

335
00:19:25,651 --> 00:19:27,311
I'm gonna be watching.

336
00:19:27,487 --> 00:19:29,314
If I think you've overstepped
a line. . .

337
00:19:29,489 --> 00:19:31,696
. . .I'll grab the nearest microphone
and say so.

338
00:19:31,867 --> 00:19:35,154
And don't be surprised if I endorse
the other guy while I'm at it.

339
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:38,866
-Are we clear?
-Yes, sir.

340
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,178
Smart move.

341
00:19:52,352 --> 00:19:55,307
If one of those guys had
Jed Bartlet's political instincts. . .

342
00:19:55,481 --> 00:19:58,055
. . .I'd be 20 points behind.

343
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:01,066
You read Ray Sullivan's file yet?

344
00:20:01,238 --> 00:20:05,071
Youngest U.S. attorney
ever confirmed by the Senate.

345
00:20:05,243 --> 00:20:07,035
Two-term state attorney general.

346
00:20:07,204 --> 00:20:10,372
Highest white-collar crime
conviction rate in the state's history.

347
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:13,080
How much white-collar crime
is there in West Virginia?

348
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:15,924
He had the guts to go after them.
That's what counts.

349
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:20,048
Highest percentage of independents
ever to vote Republican in West Virginia.

350
00:20:20,221 --> 00:20:23,805
He won the governorship
with 62 percent of the vote.

351
00:20:24,768 --> 00:20:27,474
-Reverend Butler's here.
-Thank you.

352
00:20:28,773 --> 00:20:32,689
I just wanna be an honest broker here.
That's why I brought in Bruno.

353
00:20:32,904 --> 00:20:34,696
You needed to hear
what he had to say.

354
00:20:34,865 --> 00:20:37,950
Maybe you can win 50 states
his way. . .

355
00:20:38,161 --> 00:20:43,501
. . .but if you choose Butler, you'll lock in
an Electoral College landslide today.

356
00:20:44,001 --> 00:20:48,000
Butler would scare away any Democrats
and a lot of independents.

357
00:20:48,173 --> 00:20:52,255
But you'd unite the Republican Party
while the Democrats are falling apart.

358
00:20:52,471 --> 00:20:55,425
-So you want Butler on the ticket.
-I just want you to hear. . .

359
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,219
. . .everything before making the most
important choice of your career.

360
00:20:59,396 --> 00:21:04,605
Ray Sullivan is the best man.
Don Butler is the best bet.

361
00:21:09,576 --> 00:21:10,905
Bring him in.

362
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:21,753
Reverend Butler. Thanks for coming in.

363
00:21:24,553 --> 00:21:25,929
Hey, Arnie. Good to see you.

364
00:21:26,139 --> 00:21:28,381
Thanks for coming by.
I really appreciate it.

365
00:21:28,558 --> 00:21:33,020
You know, the Secret Service has me
feeling like I'm in solitary confinement.

366
00:21:33,189 --> 00:21:35,396
You think they got a tight leash
on you now. . .

367
00:21:35,567 --> 00:21:38,854
. . .imagine what it's gonna feel like
when you move down the street.

368
00:21:40,782 --> 00:21:43,903
I hit you pretty hard
during the primaries.

369
00:21:44,078 --> 00:21:47,365
And I just want you to know
it was never personal.

370
00:21:48,542 --> 00:21:50,582
Abortion is not a political issue
with me.

371
00:21:50,754 --> 00:21:53,210
I know. I respect that.

372
00:21:53,382 --> 00:21:56,633
I've been thinking about how we
could work around our differences. . .

373
00:21:56,803 --> 00:22:00,007
. . .and put them behind us and head
toward November together.

374
00:22:00,224 --> 00:22:02,264
That's funny. So have I.

375
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:14,859
Don, I think you can help me take
the White House back for the party.

376
00:22:15,035 --> 00:22:16,613
You won states I never could win.

377
00:22:16,787 --> 00:22:19,492
I think in the general election,
with you on the ticket--

378
00:22:19,666 --> 00:22:22,240
Arnie, let me stop you right there.

379
00:22:22,795 --> 00:22:25,832
I suppose I could go along with you
on the environmental issues.

380
00:22:26,007 --> 00:22:28,000
We agree on oil drilling in ANWR.

381
00:22:28,176 --> 00:22:30,668
We could probably get closer together
on trade.

382
00:22:30,847 --> 00:22:33,421
Maybe split the difference
on textile tariffs.

383
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,637
And we could just keep talking
tax cuts, tax cuts, tax cuts.

384
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:40,348
Yeah. We're in lock step on that one.

385
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:44,314
But then we come back to abortion.

386
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:47,149
And I am here to tell you, Arnie. . .

387
00:22:47,368 --> 00:22:50,619
. . .I do not respect your position
on abortion. . .

388
00:22:50,789 --> 00:22:54,289
. . .and there's just no way in the world
I could run on a ticket with you.

389
00:22:54,502 --> 00:22:57,504
No way. You know, I wanted to be
a good soldier.

390
00:22:57,673 --> 00:23:00,295
I wanted to help the party.
I really did.

391
00:23:00,593 --> 00:23:03,630
I prayed on this one. Prayed a lot.

392
00:23:05,224 --> 00:23:07,182
And this is where I came out.

393
00:23:07,936 --> 00:23:12,895
This isn't easy for a kid who grew up
in a trailer in Appalachia.

394
00:23:13,067 --> 00:23:15,357
Finds himself within shouting distance. . .

395
00:23:15,529 --> 00:23:17,985
. . .of the vice presidency
of the United States.

396
00:23:18,199 --> 00:23:21,900
Next in line. It's not easy.

397
00:23:24,665 --> 00:23:26,208
Well. . . .

398
00:23:40,311 --> 00:23:41,722
You're kidding.

399
00:23:41,938 --> 00:23:43,682
Did you actually offer it to him?

400
00:23:43,857 --> 00:23:45,268
I tried to.

401
00:23:45,442 --> 00:23:47,649
-And he turned it down.
-No, he cut me off.

402
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:50,775
He didn't let me offer him
something he would have to refuse.

403
00:23:50,949 --> 00:23:54,284
-He's a classy guy.
-What about an endorsement?

404
00:23:54,454 --> 00:23:56,447
It wasn't the best time
to ask him for it.

405
00:23:56,623 --> 00:23:59,293
Butler's live on MSNBC.

406
00:24:03,131 --> 00:24:05,172
Did Vinick offer you
a spot on the ticket?

407
00:24:05,343 --> 00:24:07,715
No, he did not offer me
a spot on the ticket.

408
00:24:07,888 --> 00:24:09,596
Did you discuss the vice presidency?

409
00:24:09,765 --> 00:24:14,143
I requested the meeting simply to let
the senator hear directly from me...

410
00:24:14,312 --> 00:24:17,148
... that I have no interest
in running for vice president...

411
00:24:17,316 --> 00:24:19,986
...and don 't wanna be considered
for the ticket.

412
00:24:20,195 --> 00:24:23,945
Would you wanna be on the ticket if
Vinick changed his position on abortion?

413
00:24:24,117 --> 00:24:27,950
First of all, I'd get down on my knees
and thank God for performing a miracle.

414
00:24:28,164 --> 00:24:31,498
Then I'd have "Vote Vinick"
tattooed on my forehead.

415
00:24:31,668 --> 00:24:35,536
Reverend, will you pray for him
to change his mind?

416
00:24:36,883 --> 00:24:40,004
I'm sorry. You really surprised me
with that one.

417
00:24:40,179 --> 00:24:44,260
You know, I never heard a good idea
from a reporter before.

418
00:24:44,434 --> 00:24:48,813
Yes. Yes, I will pray
for Senator Vinick.

419
00:24:49,024 --> 00:24:52,228
And he's welcome to come down
to my church any time he wants...

420
00:24:52,403 --> 00:24:56,532
...and pray with me. Now, I'll be back
in the pulpit this Sunday.

421
00:24:56,742 --> 00:25:00,990
And there will always be a place for
the senator in the front row. Thank you.

422
00:25:01,164 --> 00:25:02,908
-One more question.
-Great.

423
00:25:03,083 --> 00:25:04,626
One more.

424
00:25:04,877 --> 00:25:06,206
How do we spin this thing?

425
00:25:06,379 --> 00:25:08,918
Say you fully respect
Reverend Butler's position. . .

426
00:25:09,091 --> 00:25:10,883
. . .that he's not interested in VP.

427
00:25:11,052 --> 00:25:12,879
Just keep repeating those four words:

428
00:25:13,096 --> 00:25:15,339
"Fully respect
Reverend Butler's position. "

429
00:25:15,558 --> 00:25:16,886
Five words.

430
00:25:17,059 --> 00:25:19,219
The Butler Brigade needs
to keep hearing that:

431
00:25:19,396 --> 00:25:23,442
"Respect, respect. " Then we hit them
with some direct mail pieces. . .

432
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:26,018
. . .about your opposition
to partial-birth abortion.

433
00:25:26,196 --> 00:25:29,233
Get Butler supporters
to vote for the lesser of two evils.

434
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:32,405
-Thanks.
-Are we getting Butler's endorsement?

435
00:25:32,579 --> 00:25:36,709
-Don't know.
-Why not accept his invitation?

436
00:25:36,877 --> 00:25:38,917
-Go down to his church on Sunday.
-And?

437
00:25:39,088 --> 00:25:41,840
And pray for his endorsement.

438
00:25:42,801 --> 00:25:44,130
It's a great photo op.

439
00:25:46,806 --> 00:25:50,887
Yeah, it's a great photo op,
but he can't take any questions.

440
00:25:51,061 --> 00:25:53,849
-He always takes questions.
-I know.

441
00:25:54,024 --> 00:25:57,773
That's what all of us out here
in the cheap seats love about him.

442
00:25:57,945 --> 00:25:59,570
So. . .?

443
00:25:59,739 --> 00:26:03,026
"Senator, we know what
Reverend Butler prayed for.

444
00:26:03,202 --> 00:26:04,697
What did you pray for?"

445
00:26:04,912 --> 00:26:08,662
"Senator, do you think Reverend Butler
is wrong about abortion?"

446
00:26:08,834 --> 00:26:13,165
"Senator, will you remove opposition
to abortion from the party platform?"

447
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:16,959
You ain't getting any questions about
how we pay for sports stadiums.

448
00:26:17,136 --> 00:26:19,593
So he shouldn't go to Butler's church.

449
00:26:19,765 --> 00:26:22,885
You can't play Butler.
He's not a politician.

450
00:26:23,061 --> 00:26:24,436
-Fooled me.
-Look.

451
00:26:24,604 --> 00:26:27,642
All I am saying is Butler's
gonna make a decision. . .

452
00:26:27,817 --> 00:26:30,522
. . .to endorse you and rally his troops
or not.

453
00:26:30,695 --> 00:26:32,689
There's nothing you can do about it.

454
00:26:32,865 --> 00:26:35,902
-So, what do we do?
-You play the game you came to play.

455
00:26:36,077 --> 00:26:39,198
You don't play Butler's game.
You don't play anybody else's game.

456
00:26:39,373 --> 00:26:42,292
You do exactly
what you planned to do.

457
00:26:42,461 --> 00:26:45,131
Make a move on VP quickly,
show you're moving ahead. . .

458
00:26:45,339 --> 00:26:47,416
. . .while the other side
is without a nominee.

459
00:26:47,634 --> 00:26:50,386
-Who's next on your VP list?
-Ray Sullivan.

460
00:26:50,554 --> 00:26:52,097
Good choice. Great resume.

461
00:26:52,265 --> 00:26:54,757
Crime-fighting prosecutor.
Budget-balancing governor.

462
00:26:54,935 --> 00:26:57,509
-Wins West Virginia for us.
-Get him in here today.

463
00:26:57,688 --> 00:27:01,224
Make the Sullivan meeting the story
instead of the Butler meeting.

464
00:27:01,401 --> 00:27:03,774
-Sheila?
-Works for me.

465
00:27:05,073 --> 00:27:07,612
-Okay. Set up the Sullivan meeting.
-Sounds risky.

466
00:27:07,826 --> 00:27:09,867
Not the craziest idea
from the Democrats.

467
00:27:10,038 --> 00:27:11,413
The president won't like it.

468
00:27:11,581 --> 00:27:13,455
It's the way to get
a minimum wage vote.

469
00:27:13,625 --> 00:27:15,785
But sticking an amendment
on the debt ceiling?

470
00:27:15,962 --> 00:27:18,500
They won't even try it
if the president says no.

471
00:27:18,674 --> 00:27:21,960
-When do they need an answer?
-You know, like, now.

472
00:27:22,136 --> 00:27:23,679
It's way too risky.

473
00:27:23,847 --> 00:27:26,552
But if the Democrats can force a vote
on the amendment. . .

474
00:27:26,726 --> 00:27:28,719
. . .it puts the Republicans
in a tough spot.

475
00:27:28,895 --> 00:27:31,303
Don't wanna vote against
a minimum-wage increase. . .

476
00:27:31,482 --> 00:27:33,475
-. . .in an election year.
-But they will.

477
00:27:33,651 --> 00:27:35,775
Most of them, yeah,
but what does Vinick do?

478
00:27:35,946 --> 00:27:37,986
Bad time for him to break
with his party. . .

479
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:40,565
. . .especially now that he has
this Butler problem.

480
00:27:40,744 --> 00:27:42,820
-Will he?
-He'll go where the voters are.

481
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:46,657
DNC polls show 75 percent
in favor of raising minimum wage.

482
00:27:46,835 --> 00:27:50,205
And I haven't been able to get
the working-poor a raise in seven years.

483
00:27:50,423 --> 00:27:52,167
Could be your last chance.

484
00:27:53,927 --> 00:27:56,845
He'll vote for the cloture motion.
Doesn't mean he'll vote. . .

485
00:27:57,014 --> 00:27:59,387
. . .against the minimum wage
if it comes to a vote.

486
00:27:59,559 --> 00:28:01,553
Okay.

487
00:28:04,649 --> 00:28:06,310
I know I said
we'd get there early.

488
00:28:06,485 --> 00:28:09,107
-But. . . .
-I wanna see batting practice.

489
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:12,697
Well, a couple things have come up.
You just hang on.

490
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:18,913
Okay, George. Thank you.
I really appreciate it. Good.

491
00:28:19,126 --> 00:28:20,787
You have to go vote.

492
00:28:20,962 --> 00:28:23,121
-On what?
-Cloture motion.

493
00:28:23,298 --> 00:28:27,796
Democrats are trying to stick a minimum
wage amendment on the debt ceiling.

494
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:31,220
Cheap stunt. What are they gonna do?

495
00:28:31,392 --> 00:28:34,512
Not raise the debt ceiling
if we don't raise the minimum wage?

496
00:28:34,729 --> 00:28:37,399
-It's a game of chicken now.
-Couldn't be more reckless.

497
00:28:37,566 --> 00:28:38,895
If they don't pass it. . .

498
00:28:39,068 --> 00:28:41,904
. . .we're gonna have a lot more
poor people in this country.

499
00:28:42,072 --> 00:28:44,196
Don't they know what
a depression looks like?

500
00:28:44,367 --> 00:28:46,490
The minimum wage
would be the maximum wage.

501
00:28:46,703 --> 00:28:49,658
They're aiming at you, trying to separate
you from the party.

502
00:28:49,832 --> 00:28:53,119
Seems to be getting easier every day.

503
00:28:53,295 --> 00:28:55,087
Hey, look who's here.

504
00:28:55,256 --> 00:28:58,708
-Hey, senator.
-I'm counting on you bigtime.

505
00:28:58,885 --> 00:29:00,214
I can't vote, you know.

506
00:29:00,387 --> 00:29:02,380
I'm counting on your mother
to vote for me.

507
00:29:02,557 --> 00:29:05,512
I'm counting on you to catch me
a foul ball tonight.

508
00:29:05,686 --> 00:29:08,094
No way. If I catch one,
I'm keeping it.

509
00:29:08,272 --> 00:29:11,310
She can't give it to you.
It's a violation of Senate gift rules.

510
00:29:11,485 --> 00:29:13,193
-Gotta go now.
-See you later, Tina.

511
00:29:13,362 --> 00:29:15,106
-Bye, senator.
-We'll be right back.

512
00:29:15,281 --> 00:29:16,610
It's just a quick vote.

513
00:29:16,783 --> 00:29:19,240
We gotta get past the press
as fast as we can.

514
00:29:19,412 --> 00:29:21,950
-No Butler questions.
-Okay.

515
00:29:22,123 --> 00:29:23,452
-Senator.
-Senator.

516
00:29:23,625 --> 00:29:26,793
-Sorry, guys, he's got no time.
-Were you surprised at Butler's--?

517
00:29:26,963 --> 00:29:29,455
-Sorry. I gotta vote.
-You accepting his invitation?

518
00:29:29,633 --> 00:29:30,962
I really have to go. Sorry.

519
00:29:31,135 --> 00:29:33,128
Are you coming to his church
this Sunday?

520
00:29:33,304 --> 00:29:36,057
I think I'm gonna--
I have some TV commitments that day.

521
00:29:36,225 --> 00:29:38,598
Meet the Press is more important
than church?

522
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:40,810
I don't know what my schedule
is on Sunday.

523
00:29:40,981 --> 00:29:42,310
-Get us out of here.
-Sorry.

524
00:29:42,483 --> 00:29:44,143
Going to another church on Sunday?

525
00:29:44,319 --> 00:29:47,819
Do you think doing Sunday TV is
more important than going to church?

526
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:50,612
-Where do you go to church, senator?
-Senator.

527
00:29:50,785 --> 00:29:53,241
-Do you go to church at all?
-Senator.

528
00:29:55,833 --> 00:29:57,411
No, Mike, no one saw this coming.

529
00:29:57,586 --> 00:30:00,421
Vinick went from the candidate
who answered any question...

530
00:30:00,589 --> 00:30:03,627
... to being the guy who won 't even
tell us if he goes to church.

531
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:07,006
-Let's round up the troops.
-Senator, do you go to church?

532
00:30:07,932 --> 00:30:10,056
Honey, we're kind of busy right now.

533
00:30:10,268 --> 00:30:12,060
We gotta get you to that game, right?

534
00:30:12,271 --> 00:30:15,189
I didn't really expect
to see batting practice.

535
00:30:20,824 --> 00:30:23,494
I haven't gone to church for a while.

536
00:30:23,702 --> 00:30:25,696
-I think you should.
-Yeah.

537
00:30:25,872 --> 00:30:27,497
Unless you don't believe in God.

538
00:30:27,707 --> 00:30:29,914
My best friend, Maggie,
doesn't believe. . .

539
00:30:30,086 --> 00:30:32,162
. . .because her parents
don't believe in God.

540
00:30:32,338 --> 00:30:36,918
But she still comes to our church on
Christmas Eve to see the nativity play. . .

541
00:30:37,094 --> 00:30:40,595
. . .because I'm always in it,
and she's my best friend.

542
00:30:45,731 --> 00:30:48,103
I gotta get back to work.

543
00:30:50,403 --> 00:30:51,732
Hang in there, honey.

544
00:30:53,741 --> 00:30:55,070
Right. Just so you know. . .

545
00:30:55,243 --> 00:30:58,909
. . .our polling shows that if you were
to revise your position on abortion. . .

546
00:30:59,081 --> 00:31:00,991
-. . .you would--
-Flip-flop on abortion?

547
00:31:01,167 --> 00:31:03,326
You would take 51 to 53 percent
of the vote. . .

548
00:31:03,503 --> 00:31:06,042
. . .and a comfortable cushion
in the Electoral College.

549
00:31:06,215 --> 00:31:09,051
-Thanks, that's very helpful.
-Just thought you should know.

550
00:31:09,219 --> 00:31:11,592
One shot of you walking
into a church on Sunday. . .

551
00:31:11,764 --> 00:31:14,256
-. . .to put this church thing behind us.
-Won't work.

552
00:31:14,434 --> 00:31:17,008
The press will ask,
"Why not go to Butler's church?"

553
00:31:17,229 --> 00:31:20,231
Then they'll ask you when was
the last time you went to church.

554
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,974
I'm guessing wasn't last week.

555
00:31:23,612 --> 00:31:25,487
Been a while.

556
00:31:31,164 --> 00:31:32,956
How long?

557
00:31:34,418 --> 00:31:36,245
Counting weddings and funerals?

558
00:31:37,589 --> 00:31:40,840
Okay, everybody. Governor Sullivan's
gonna be here any minute.

559
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:42,919
Let's clear out.

560
00:31:57,656 --> 00:32:00,148
Has it been years?

561
00:32:00,326 --> 00:32:02,284
You know where I am
Sunday mornings?

562
00:32:02,454 --> 00:32:04,661
I'm in here or at home,
doing my job. . .

563
00:32:04,832 --> 00:32:08,118
. . .doing what I promised
the people of California I would do.

564
00:32:08,295 --> 00:32:10,169
Giving every minute I can.

565
00:32:10,381 --> 00:32:12,955
-How many years?
-I don't know.

566
00:32:14,135 --> 00:32:17,137
I used to go with my wife
every Sunday I was in California.

567
00:32:17,306 --> 00:32:20,890
Then when she got too sick to go,
you know, I stayed home with her.

568
00:32:22,646 --> 00:32:25,684
And after her funeral, I didn't wanna
go into that church again.

569
00:32:26,109 --> 00:32:29,561
So about five or six years.

570
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:32,409
I'm not the only senator
who doesn't go to church.

571
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:34,694
You're not just a senator anymore.

572
00:32:38,625 --> 00:32:42,209
Yeah. Okay. Put him through.

573
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:43,958
It's Royce.

574
00:32:46,093 --> 00:32:48,300
Yes, Mr. Leader.

575
00:32:50,766 --> 00:32:52,095
I understand.

576
00:32:53,144 --> 00:32:55,433
Yes, he can handle that.

577
00:32:55,605 --> 00:32:57,931
We'll get him over there right away.

578
00:32:58,609 --> 00:33:00,401
He wants you to go see the president.

579
00:33:01,655 --> 00:33:04,610
-Governor Sullivan is here.
-Thank you.

580
00:33:06,786 --> 00:33:10,239
Royce is afraid they're not gonna pass
the debt-ceiling bill in time.

581
00:33:10,416 --> 00:33:12,789
Wants you to work out a deal
with the president. . .

582
00:33:12,961 --> 00:33:16,331
. . .so the Democrats will let us pass
the debt ceiling before midnight.

583
00:33:16,507 --> 00:33:20,007
So five minutes with the governor,
then you'll go to the White House.

584
00:33:20,178 --> 00:33:21,756
Okay.

585
00:33:26,228 --> 00:33:28,186
-Governor Sullivan.
-Sheila.

586
00:33:29,399 --> 00:33:31,226
Hey, Ray. Great to see you again.

587
00:33:31,401 --> 00:33:33,727
-Good to see you, Arnie.
-Have a seat, please.

588
00:33:33,904 --> 00:33:36,692
-Thank you.
-I'm sorry. I gotta make this quick.

589
00:33:36,866 --> 00:33:39,489
The Democrats are jamming us up
with an important vote.

590
00:33:39,662 --> 00:33:41,821
Gotta go to the president,
straighten it out.

591
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:44,413
Well, governing before politics,
that's my motto.

592
00:33:44,585 --> 00:33:46,625
-Really?
-No, I'm just kidding.

593
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:49,337
Come on. Loosen up, Arnie.

594
00:33:51,176 --> 00:33:54,593
Everyone on TV tonight
is saying that this meeting. . .

595
00:33:54,764 --> 00:33:56,722
. . .is about the vice presidency.

596
00:33:57,643 --> 00:33:59,553
Well, they're right for once.

597
00:33:59,771 --> 00:34:01,313
-Did you offer it to Butler?
-No.

598
00:34:01,481 --> 00:34:03,854
Good. I don't wanna be
anybody's second choice.

599
00:34:04,068 --> 00:34:07,485
You've seen this problem develop today
about my going to church.

600
00:34:07,698 --> 00:34:09,489
-You mean, not going to church.
-Yeah.

601
00:34:09,658 --> 00:34:11,865
That's all right.
I go enough for both of us.

602
00:34:14,081 --> 00:34:17,332
I've been reading about your positions
on a lot of things.

603
00:34:17,502 --> 00:34:19,495
But there are
some environmental issues. . .

604
00:34:19,713 --> 00:34:21,706
. . .you haven't dealt
with in West Virginia.

605
00:34:21,882 --> 00:34:23,876
Here's the deal with the issues, Arnie.

606
00:34:24,052 --> 00:34:27,303
I can get in line with you
on everything except abortion.

607
00:34:27,473 --> 00:34:30,641
Nothing's gonna make me
change my mind on that.

608
00:34:31,061 --> 00:34:32,971
But I'm guessing
you wouldn't want me to.

609
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:01,714
Toby, do you have a copy of the--?

610
00:35:19,331 --> 00:35:21,371
The president's waiting for you,
senator.

611
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:42,523
Mr. President, I'd hate to think that
you were consulted by Democrats. . .

612
00:35:42,694 --> 00:35:45,530
. . .about doing something
as irresponsible. . .

613
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:48,066
. . .as playing games
with the debt ceiling.

614
00:35:50,871 --> 00:35:52,580
Have a seat.

615
00:35:54,334 --> 00:35:57,669
But I'd like to think
they'd follow your leadership. . .

616
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:00,081
. . .if we could agree on a way
out of this mess.

617
00:36:01,385 --> 00:36:03,343
-You came to the right place.
-Good.

618
00:36:03,972 --> 00:36:05,300
What did you have in mind?

619
00:36:05,515 --> 00:36:08,470
Democrats withdraw
the minimum-wage amendment. . .

620
00:36:08,644 --> 00:36:11,053
. . .from the debt-ceiling bill.
You pass the bill. . .

621
00:36:11,231 --> 00:36:14,648
. . .then you give them a vote
on the minimum wage.

622
00:36:14,861 --> 00:36:16,521
You'll lose on the minimum wage.

623
00:36:16,738 --> 00:36:20,274
We might be able to shame enough
Republicans into doing the right thing. . .

624
00:36:20,451 --> 00:36:22,195
. . .in an election year.

625
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:25,491
How about you withdraw
the minimum-wage amendment. . .

626
00:36:25,666 --> 00:36:28,668
. . .we pass the debt ceiling clean. . .

627
00:36:28,962 --> 00:36:33,756
. . .and I round up enough Republican votes
to pass the minimum-wage increase.

628
00:36:33,927 --> 00:36:35,255
You can get that done?

629
00:36:35,429 --> 00:36:37,636
We have Republican senators
in seven states. . .

630
00:36:37,807 --> 00:36:40,844
. . .with higher minimum wages
than the federal level.

631
00:36:41,019 --> 00:36:42,811
California, it's a buck-50 higher.

632
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:45,353
We don't want jobs moving
to lower-wage states.

633
00:36:45,567 --> 00:36:47,227
I can get you the votes.

634
00:36:48,445 --> 00:36:51,151
-What do you want from me?
-I announce the deal.

635
00:36:53,702 --> 00:36:56,490
Democratic candidates for president
wouldn't be happy. . .

636
00:36:56,664 --> 00:36:58,456
. . .watching you take credit for this.

637
00:36:59,626 --> 00:37:02,545
Well, then let them pass
the debt ceiling for you. . .

638
00:37:02,713 --> 00:37:04,754
. . .and get you the
minimum-wage increase.

639
00:37:05,884 --> 00:37:07,628
Anything else?

640
00:37:08,221 --> 00:37:10,926
-Help me keep a secret.
-What's that?

641
00:37:11,141 --> 00:37:13,430
That I just gave you
more than you asked for.

642
00:37:15,063 --> 00:37:17,471
Let me hang around for a while. . .

643
00:37:17,649 --> 00:37:20,853
. . .as if we're really slugging it out
in here.

644
00:37:22,405 --> 00:37:23,781
Can I get you anything?

645
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:25,862
Where's the ice cream?

646
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:29,322
I think I could live on coffee ice cream.

647
00:37:29,498 --> 00:37:33,283
Hardest thing about this job is knowing
this stash is down here 24 hours a day.

648
00:37:33,461 --> 00:37:37,246
-How's your health?
-Good days and bad days.

649
00:37:37,717 --> 00:37:39,793
Good days aren't as good
as they used to be.

650
00:37:40,262 --> 00:37:45,055
Kind of like a speeded-up
version of aging.

651
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:48,514
-You've had better days, huh?
-Yeah.

652
00:37:48,689 --> 00:37:51,893
Whatever happened to separation
of church and state?

653
00:37:52,068 --> 00:37:55,937
It's hanging in there, but I'm afraid
the Constitution doesn't say anything. . .

654
00:37:56,115 --> 00:37:58,524
. . .about the separation of church
and politics.

655
00:37:59,036 --> 00:38:00,614
You saying that's a good thing?

656
00:38:00,830 --> 00:38:03,037
I'm saying it's the way it is.
Always has been.

657
00:38:03,249 --> 00:38:06,121
You think the voter really needs
to know if I go to church?

658
00:38:06,295 --> 00:38:10,163
I don't need to know, but then I'm
not gonna vote for you anyway.

659
00:38:10,968 --> 00:38:13,091
It's not up to us to decide. . .

660
00:38:13,262 --> 00:38:15,754
. . .what the voters get to use
in evaluating us.

661
00:38:16,141 --> 00:38:19,012
A little odd coming from someone. . .

662
00:38:19,228 --> 00:38:22,064
. . .who wasn't exactly completely open
about his health.

663
00:38:22,232 --> 00:38:25,234
-That was a big mistake.
-Was it?

664
00:38:26,404 --> 00:38:29,572
What did we know about
Lincoln's health when he was running?

665
00:38:29,742 --> 00:38:31,486
Nothing.

666
00:38:31,661 --> 00:38:33,239
Washington, Jefferson.

667
00:38:33,413 --> 00:38:34,742
What about FDR's health?

668
00:38:35,124 --> 00:38:38,042
And when he died in office,
did people say:

669
00:38:38,253 --> 00:38:41,587
"Gee, why didn't he tell us
he was sick?" No.

670
00:38:41,757 --> 00:38:43,881
Did they say,
"I wish I didn't vote for him"?

671
00:38:44,636 --> 00:38:46,214
No.

672
00:38:47,097 --> 00:38:50,598
I don't know how you plan to handle
this religious thing in the campaign.

673
00:38:50,769 --> 00:38:53,973
Yeah, well, that makes two of us.

674
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:56,978
I could let it slip that I think
a candidate's religion. . .

675
00:38:57,152 --> 00:39:00,937
. . .or how often he goes to church
isn't relevant to choosing a president.

676
00:39:01,366 --> 00:39:03,240
You'll say that on the way
into church?

677
00:39:04,161 --> 00:39:06,949
Are you accusing me
of politicizing churchgoing?

678
00:39:07,123 --> 00:39:09,828
You've had an awful lot of photo ops
on the church steps.

679
00:39:10,002 --> 00:39:14,499
I went to Mass every Sunday
long before I went into politics.

680
00:39:15,091 --> 00:39:16,919
I did too.

681
00:39:18,429 --> 00:39:20,007
Why'd you stop?

682
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:29,266
One Christmas, my wife gave me a
very old edition of the King James Bible.

683
00:39:29,777 --> 00:39:31,106
Seventeenth century.

684
00:39:32,155 --> 00:39:34,528
It was a real find for a book collector.

685
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:38,568
It was a thrill just to hold it.
Then I read it.

686
00:39:40,123 --> 00:39:41,535
You can't take it literally.

687
00:39:41,709 --> 00:39:44,035
That's what my priest friends
kept telling me.

688
00:39:44,212 --> 00:39:47,048
But the more I read it,
the less I could believe.

689
00:39:47,258 --> 00:39:49,963
I could not believe there was a God. . .

690
00:39:50,136 --> 00:39:54,883
. . .who said that the penalty
for working on the Sabbath was death.

691
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:57,018
I couldn't believe there was a God. . .

692
00:39:57,187 --> 00:39:59,394
. . .who said the penalty
for adultery was death.

693
00:39:59,774 --> 00:40:01,648
I'm more of a New Testament man
myself.

694
00:40:01,818 --> 00:40:06,196
I couldn't believe that there was a God
who had no penalty for slavery.

695
00:40:06,407 --> 00:40:09,492
The Bible has no problem
with slavery at all.

696
00:40:10,621 --> 00:40:13,195
Lincoln could have used
a little help from the Bible.

697
00:40:13,416 --> 00:40:15,243
You think Lincoln was an atheist?

698
00:40:17,463 --> 00:40:18,922
I hope not.

699
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:22,756
That would mean all his references
to God were just purely political.

700
00:40:22,928 --> 00:40:25,550
He didn't make any until he started
running for office.

701
00:40:25,724 --> 00:40:28,476
No, and he certainly was a doubter.

702
00:40:28,644 --> 00:40:30,103
What about you?

703
00:40:33,066 --> 00:40:34,858
You gonna try to save my soul?

704
00:40:35,528 --> 00:40:37,106
Sorry.

705
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:41,694
Let's just say I struggled
for a long time with that book.

706
00:40:42,453 --> 00:40:45,159
Finally, I just gave up the struggle.

707
00:40:47,084 --> 00:40:50,454
The only thing you can pray for
in this job. . .

708
00:40:50,672 --> 00:40:53,378
. . .is the strength
to get through the day.

709
00:40:53,676 --> 00:40:57,591
You can try coffee if you want,
but prayer works better for me.

710
00:41:01,436 --> 00:41:03,513
Try the pistachio.

711
00:41:06,609 --> 00:41:09,979
Yes. We have reached an agreement
on the debt-ceiling bill.

712
00:41:10,155 --> 00:41:13,157
We will pass it within the hour
and send it to the president. . .

713
00:41:13,326 --> 00:41:15,118
. . .for his signature before midnight.

714
00:41:15,287 --> 00:41:16,616
The minimum-wage amendment?

715
00:41:16,789 --> 00:41:20,040
We have a separate vote on the
minimum-wage increase tomorrow.

716
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:21,918
-Is it gonna pass?
-Yes, it will.

717
00:41:22,087 --> 00:41:23,416
I'll vote for it.

718
00:41:23,589 --> 00:41:26,425
There'll be more than enough
bipartisan support to pass it.

719
00:41:26,593 --> 00:41:30,509
Are you reconsidering Reverend Butler's
invitation to his church this weekend?

720
00:41:30,682 --> 00:41:33,849
I fully respect
Reverend Butler's position.

721
00:41:34,395 --> 00:41:38,643
I mean, I appreciate his invitation,
and. . . .

722
00:41:41,696 --> 00:41:47,237
Look, I respect Reverend Butler.

723
00:41:47,495 --> 00:41:51,197
And I respect his church too much
to use it for my own political purposes.

724
00:41:51,375 --> 00:41:54,330
That's exactly what I'd be doing
if I went there this Sunday.

725
00:41:54,546 --> 00:41:58,627
Because the truth is, it would just be
an act of political phoniness.

726
00:41:58,801 --> 00:42:00,130
I may be wrong...

727
00:42:00,303 --> 00:42:04,302
...but I suspect our churches already
have enough political phonies in them.

728
00:42:04,475 --> 00:42:06,053
Senator, do you or do you not--?

729
00:42:06,227 --> 00:42:08,980
You can 't have a separation
of church and state...

730
00:42:09,148 --> 00:42:13,645
. . .if you have to pass a religious test
to get in this government.

731
00:42:14,989 --> 00:42:19,153
And I wanna warn everyone in the press
and all the voters out there. . .

732
00:42:20,746 --> 00:42:24,448
. . .if you demand expressions
of religious faith from politicians. . .

733
00:42:24,626 --> 00:42:27,165
. . .you are just begging to be lied to.

734
00:42:27,379 --> 00:42:30,880
They won 't all lie to you,
but a lot of them will.

735
00:42:31,051 --> 00:42:34,053
It'll be the easiest lie they had to tell
to get your votes.

736
00:42:34,263 --> 00:42:37,929
So every day until the end
of this campaign. . .

737
00:42:38,310 --> 00:42:41,146
. . .I'll answer any question anyone has
on government.

738
00:42:41,314 --> 00:42:45,609
But if you have a question on religion,
please, go to church. Thank you.

739
00:42:45,778 --> 00:42:49,907
Senator. Senator Vinick. Senator.

740
00:42:50,305 --> 00:43:50,547
