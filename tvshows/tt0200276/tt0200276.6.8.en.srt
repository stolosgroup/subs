1
00:00:06,058 --> 00:00:08,219
Previously on The West Wing:

2
00:00:08,438 --> 00:00:12,441
-I had to take the summit from Josh.
-Yeah.

3
00:00:12,656 --> 00:00:14,152
Governor Baker, welcome.

4
00:00:14,368 --> 00:00:15,615
Baker's running, right?

5
00:00:15,788 --> 00:00:18,662
Yeah. And he'll have it wrapped up
by Super Tuesday.

6
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:22,049
-How are your numbers in Iowa?
-Iowa and New Hampshire look good.

7
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:26,638
I get why you're so worried about Baker,
but why not about Hoynes?

8
00:00:26,855 --> 00:00:30,062
I'm running for president.
I want you to run my campaign.

9
00:00:30,238 --> 00:00:33,409
Russell is on his way to being
the nominee and our next president.

10
00:00:33,579 --> 00:00:35,621
So get onboard or get out
of my way.

11
00:00:35,834 --> 00:00:37,544
You're too good at this.
You can't walk away.

12
00:00:37,713 --> 00:00:39,090
Watch me.

13

14
00:00:51,453 --> 00:00:54,411
-He's a Republican.
-Not really. He's a California Republican.

15
00:00:54,585 --> 00:00:57,424
Are we really saying that there isn't
a single Democrat--?

16
00:00:57,592 --> 00:01:00,347
The president thinks Vinick's
perfect for U.N. ambassador.

17
00:01:00,515 --> 00:01:03,224
It's your job to feel him out,
see if he'd be up for it.

18
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:08,362
Thank you. Oh, thanks. We can't tell you
what an honor it's been to be here. . .

19
00:01:08,534 --> 00:01:10,945
. . .to actually work here
in the White House.

20
00:01:11,123 --> 00:01:15,078
We want to thank our new best friend,
Zoey Bartlet, the first daughter.

21
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:18,090
-I am not the first daughter.
-Well, I thought--

22
00:01:18,306 --> 00:01:22,095
Okay, okay, Zoey Bartlet,
the third daughter of the first family.

23
00:01:22,274 --> 00:01:26,027
-Come on, guys. One more trick.
-You are just spoiled rotten, aren't you?

24
00:01:26,241 --> 00:01:27,785
-Just one.
-Please?

25
00:01:27,953 --> 00:01:31,742
-Please.
-You deserve another trick. Teller?

26
00:01:43,489 --> 00:01:45,484
A simple red handkerchief.

27
00:02:10,801 --> 00:02:14,638
I love that trick. It's so simple.
There is nothing like a vanish.

28
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:18,314
So pure. But what does it mean?
I know what you're thinking.

29
00:02:18,485 --> 00:02:22,155
A magic trick, a simple vanish,
could have no meaning whatsoever.

30
00:02:22,369 --> 00:02:25,873
What if, instead of using a handkerchief,
a meaningless piece of cloth. . .

31
00:02:26,044 --> 00:02:30,213
. . .we were to use a piece of cloth
that was nothing but meaning?

32
00:02:30,388 --> 00:02:34,972
What if the piece of cloth we chose was
the flag of the United States of America?

33
00:02:35,149 --> 00:02:38,153
Because, you know,
with this flag on-stage. . .

34
00:02:38,364 --> 00:02:40,740
. . .there's a lot to think about.

35
00:02:41,288 --> 00:02:45,207
Now it catches the gleam
Of the morning's first beam

36
00:02:45,422 --> 00:02:49,556
In full glory reflected
It shines in the stream

37
00:02:49,724 --> 00:02:53,976
'Tis the Star-Spangled Banner
O long may it wave

38
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:57,773
O 'er the land of the free
And the home of the brave

39
00:02:57,993 --> 00:02:59,537
And what if, instead of using. . .

40
00:02:59,705 --> 00:03:02,330
. . .that piece of construction paper,
we were to use. . .

41
00:03:02,503 --> 00:03:04,582
. . .a piece of paper
that means more to us. . .

42
00:03:04,758 --> 00:03:08,975
. . .than any other piece of paper
in the world? The Bill of Rights.

43
00:03:14,572 --> 00:03:17,862
It's the one that guarantees not just
everybody in this room. . .

44
00:03:18,038 --> 00:03:20,960
. . .but every single person
in the United States. . .

45
00:03:21,129 --> 00:03:25,084
. . .every citizen, every visitor,
every magician, freedom of speech.

46
00:03:25,263 --> 00:03:30,264
It's the one that says if we want to add
a little bit of spontaneous combustion. . .

47
00:03:30,442 --> 00:03:33,447
. . .to our simple vanish,
we can do that.

48
00:03:33,616 --> 00:03:40,291
We can take some tinder
and a very eccentric magic wand. . .

49
00:03:40,715 --> 00:03:43,720
. . .and we can do this.

50
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:47,977
And it's okay, because even though
the flag is gone. . .

51
00:03:48,149 --> 00:03:50,904
. . .the Bill of Rights remains.

52
00:03:53,578 --> 00:03:56,907
Did they just burn an American flag
in the White House?

53
00:04:46,304 --> 00:04:49,924
Okay, here's the latest updated schedule
for the China summit.

54
00:04:50,101 --> 00:04:52,937
Guys, I'm just gonna run through
the highlights real quick.

55
00:04:53,105 --> 00:04:55,348
The president leaves Andrews
at 2: 15 p.m. . .

56
00:04:55,525 --> 00:04:57,732
. . .with a stop in Louisiana
before departing. . .

57
00:04:57,903 --> 00:04:59,897
. . .from New Orleans
for the Beijing flight.

58
00:05:00,073 --> 00:05:02,529
When will the president appoint
a U.N. ambassador?

59
00:05:02,701 --> 00:05:07,745
The first lady will arrive in Beijing in time
for the state dinner on Thursday night.

60
00:05:07,917 --> 00:05:10,124
How long will the U.N. post
remain vacant?

61
00:05:10,295 --> 00:05:13,831
Not as long as I'll ignore questions about
anything except the China trip.

62
00:05:14,009 --> 00:05:17,461
In the New Orleans stop, the president
will meet with shrimp fishermen--

63
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:18,754
-Shrimpers.
-What?

64
00:05:18,932 --> 00:05:21,175
They're called shrimpers,
not shrimp fishermen.

65
00:05:21,352 --> 00:05:23,678
The president will meet
with representatives. . .

66
00:05:23,855 --> 00:05:26,608
. . .of the shrimp industry
about their request to invoke. . .

67
00:05:26,776 --> 00:05:29,695
. . .antidumping sanctions against
imported Chinese shrimp.

68
00:05:29,864 --> 00:05:32,700
Here's the human rights statement
you and President Lian. . .

69
00:05:32,868 --> 00:05:34,695
. . .will put out after the first day.

70
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:37,113
-Not a word about Tibet?
-Tibet's in there.

71
00:05:37,332 --> 00:05:40,833
-We couldn't use the word "Tibet. "
-Show me where the Tibet sentence is.

72
00:05:41,004 --> 00:05:43,211
Sir, what you say in the room
is up to you.

73
00:05:43,382 --> 00:05:45,459
What we say in the joint statement
is not.

74
00:05:45,677 --> 00:05:49,261
-I'll hammer them on Tibet.
-They'll hammer your Indian reservations.

75
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:52,345
-Reservations weren't my idea.
-I'm sure they'll understand.

76
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:55,729
The Department of Transportation
has a lot on its plate right now.

77
00:05:55,899 --> 00:05:58,652
Mr. Secretary, you've got transportation
on your plate.

78
00:05:58,862 --> 00:06:02,232
Look, Josh, the truth is I assumed you
were going on the China trip. . .

79
00:06:02,408 --> 00:06:04,318
. . .and we'd have a week
to do research.

80
00:06:04,494 --> 00:06:09,039
This is more important than the trip. This
is the U.S. budget we're talking about.

81
00:06:09,251 --> 00:06:11,743
Your department hasn't submitted
a budget proposal.

82
00:06:11,963 --> 00:06:15,463
I can't ask OMB to put together
a complete budget estimate until I got--

83
00:06:15,635 --> 00:06:17,592
I'll be back.

84
00:06:17,762 --> 00:06:21,844
Vinick's confirmed for 11: 15. We have
to move your OMB meeting to now.

85
00:06:22,018 --> 00:06:24,225
-One minute.
-Then you've got that other thing.

86
00:06:24,396 --> 00:06:26,105
-What thing?
-Me.

87
00:06:26,274 --> 00:06:27,603
Right. Sure.

88
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:31,028
Hey. You're back.

89
00:06:31,197 --> 00:06:34,153
No. I just have to sort out some files
I left in my office.

90
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:37,163
-Can't Margaret send them to the house?
-Be a federal crime.

91
00:06:37,331 --> 00:06:39,205
-"Your eyes only" kind of thing?
-Yeah.

92
00:06:39,417 --> 00:06:42,538
-Hear about this Vinick thing?
-President ran it by me yesterday.

93
00:06:42,713 --> 00:06:46,380
I can't believe it. Vinick's been
investigating us for seven years. . .

94
00:06:46,552 --> 00:06:49,554
-. . .and we're offering him a job?
-We've had run-ins with him--

95
00:06:49,723 --> 00:06:52,049
-Some run-ins?
-He has supported the president. . .

96
00:06:52,226 --> 00:06:53,638
. . .on foreign policy.

97
00:06:53,812 --> 00:06:57,063
-Hey, sweetie.
-Hey, boss.

98
00:06:57,233 --> 00:07:00,152
-Let me tell C.J. you're here.
-No. Set me up with the files.

99
00:07:00,321 --> 00:07:03,026
-I'll stay out of the way.
-They're in C.J.'s old office.

100
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,528
-Shredder?
-Engine's running.

101
00:07:04,702 --> 00:07:07,704
And this is the statement
on regional security that you. . .

102
00:07:07,873 --> 00:07:10,828
. . .and President Lian will put out
at the end of the last day.

103
00:07:11,002 --> 00:07:14,170
The last day should just be
about North Korea.

104
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:17,544
They'll only discuss North Korea
in the context of regional issues.

105
00:07:17,719 --> 00:07:21,505
Don't they understand that North Korea
is their regional security problem?

106
00:07:21,683 --> 00:07:26,062
-Fix that, we've saved half the world.
-I made it clear you want to talk about it.

107
00:07:26,273 --> 00:07:30,224
Tell China if we discuss North Korea,
we don't have to discuss anything else.

108
00:07:30,445 --> 00:07:34,314
Mr. President, our agenda with China
is now as long and complex. . .

109
00:07:34,492 --> 00:07:37,364
-. . .as it is with any other country.
-I know.

110
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:40,617
-To narrow a summit to this one issue--
-I know, I know.

111
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:42,786
We can talk about the rest
on the plane.

112
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:45,881
Mr. President, let's cover as much
as we can with the staff--

113
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:49,966
We got 20 hours to kill in the air
over the next two days.

114
00:07:51,098 --> 00:07:53,673
We got an election coming up,
and we're saying. . .

115
00:07:53,852 --> 00:07:56,095
. . .no Democrat can represent us
at the U.N.?

116
00:07:56,272 --> 00:08:00,271
-The president wants Arnold Vinick.
-Was Vinick your recommendation?

117
00:08:00,445 --> 00:08:05,239
I've known the guy 30 years, and
I don't know anyone better for the job.

118
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:09,741
I'm sorry. I'm having some trouble
imagining Arnie Vinick as a diplomat.

119
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:14,295
The U.N. could use some tough love.
The president wanted to ask him himself.

120
00:08:14,464 --> 00:08:18,878
But you don't want him alone in the
room until we know Vinick will say yes.

121
00:08:19,053 --> 00:08:22,637
If he plays hard to get, I'm out of there.
I'm not begging a Republican.

122
00:08:22,808 --> 00:08:25,680
If he says yes, he won't be
investigating us anymore.

123
00:08:25,854 --> 00:08:27,895
We're doing this to get him
off our backs?

124
00:08:28,066 --> 00:08:31,436
No. The president thinks
he's the best we can get.

125
00:08:31,612 --> 00:08:33,902
I'm just trying to give you
your motivation.

126
00:08:34,074 --> 00:08:37,526
I think we're all anxious about
the subjects because you're insisting. . .

127
00:08:37,704 --> 00:08:40,030
. . .on being alone
with the Chinese leaders.

128
00:08:40,249 --> 00:08:44,034
-Now you want to be in the room too?
-I do not, but I think C.J. and Kate and--

129
00:08:44,213 --> 00:08:47,215
I don't want to fly all the way to China
just to participate. . .

130
00:08:47,384 --> 00:08:50,421
. . .in another phony ritual
of putting out joint statements. . .

131
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:54,181
-. . .on what we agreed to before.
-After the Taiwanese flag controversy. . .

132
00:08:54,393 --> 00:08:57,728
-. . .we're lucky they didn't cancel it.
-This is my last China summit.

133
00:08:57,898 --> 00:08:59,179
It's my last chance.

134
00:08:59,358 --> 00:09:01,648
I want to walk in there
and show the Chinese. . .

135
00:09:01,862 --> 00:09:04,817
. . .that they are not dealing with some
staff-dependent puppet.

136
00:09:05,033 --> 00:09:09,578
I want them to see that I'm ready to get
some work done right there in the room.

137
00:09:09,748 --> 00:09:14,791
Progress isn't good enough for me now.
I want to get something done.

138
00:09:17,467 --> 00:09:19,507
-You like shrimp, don't you?
-I love it.

139
00:09:19,678 --> 00:09:23,179
You might be interested to know how
much of the shrimp sold in the U.S. . .

140
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:25,390
. . .actually comes from China.

141
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:29,390
Nice. Okay, go ahead.

142
00:09:29,817 --> 00:09:32,309
Yes. Well, one of the most difficult
trade issues. . .

143
00:09:32,487 --> 00:09:35,608
. . .on the agenda this time is shrimp.

144
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,319
-Shrimp.
-On the summit's last day. . .

145
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:40,405
. . .the agenda
will be regional security.

146
00:09:40,581 --> 00:09:42,491
-Does that include North Korea?
-Yes.

147
00:09:42,668 --> 00:09:43,997
So can we expect to hear--?

148
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:47,255
Let me get through the return trip
itinerary, and we're done.

149
00:09:47,424 --> 00:09:50,794
Is it true that Penn and Teller burned
a U.S. flag in the White House?

150
00:09:51,012 --> 00:09:52,922
I'm not taking any questions.

151
00:09:53,099 --> 00:09:55,092
They say that they were gonna
burn a flag?

152
00:09:55,268 --> 00:09:58,473
-Who invited them to the White House?
-Penn and Teller performed. . .

153
00:09:58,648 --> 00:10:01,021
. . .at a private party last night
in the East Room.

154
00:10:01,193 --> 00:10:04,065
As it was a private party,
the White House has no comment.

155
00:10:04,239 --> 00:10:08,072
-Do you have a list of who was at--?
-As I said-- I'm not taking any questions.

156
00:10:08,244 --> 00:10:11,780
-You just did.
-Well, I'm not taking any more.

157
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,376
Even if we make significant progress
in tariffs and quotas. . .

158
00:10:16,547 --> 00:10:19,834
. . .if they don't budge
on the currency issue. . .

159
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:23,131
. . .then we might not actually be able
to achieve any real gains--

160
00:10:23,307 --> 00:10:26,059
"State has confirmed that China
just released Wen Jong. . .

161
00:10:26,227 --> 00:10:28,980
. . .as a goodwill gesture
before the president's arrival.

162
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:32,774
The dissident had been jailed for six
and a half years--" Congratulations.

163
00:10:32,945 --> 00:10:34,819
They always give us one
before a summit.

164
00:10:34,989 --> 00:10:38,656
-Wen Jong's not just any dissident.
-We need to draft a statement. Milly.

165
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:41,243
-Hi, C.J.
-Madame Surgeon General. . .

166
00:10:41,456 --> 00:10:44,293
. . .the briefing book on public health
in China is maybe. . .

167
00:10:44,461 --> 00:10:47,997
. . .a touch too technical for someone
who almost flunked organic chemistry.

168
00:10:48,174 --> 00:10:50,500
-What'd you get, a B?
-B plus, as I recall.

169
00:10:50,677 --> 00:10:52,006
I don't remember any of it.

170
00:10:52,179 --> 00:10:53,758
-Are your bags packed?
-Excuse me?

171
00:10:53,932 --> 00:10:57,432
I need a seminar from you on the plane
about SARS and AIDS in China.

172
00:10:57,645 --> 00:10:59,473
-No joke?
-Wheels up at, what, C.J.?

173
00:10:59,648 --> 00:11:01,938
Two-fifteen, but we're
20 minutes behind, so. . . .

174
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:03,770
-So you got time to pack.
-Yes, sir.

175
00:11:04,071 --> 00:11:07,405
-Leonard, go ahead.
-Stanley. As I was saying. . .

176
00:11:07,575 --> 00:11:10,281
. . .since the Chinese currency remains. . . .

177
00:11:10,746 --> 00:11:12,870
-Penn and Teller thing leaked.
-Big surprise.

178
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:15,076
I got it when I gave
the China schedule.

179
00:11:15,294 --> 00:11:18,131
-How'd the "private party" line work?
-Like a lead balloon.

180
00:11:18,298 --> 00:11:21,835
-President won't let us say anything.
-They want to know who invited them.

181
00:11:22,012 --> 00:11:25,097
-And who was in the room.
-And if the president was there.

182
00:11:25,266 --> 00:11:27,343
I knew it would leak
the second it happened.

183
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:29,638
The second what happened?

184
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:32,478
It was a magic trick.
How do we know what they did?

185
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:36,063
-They didn't burn the flag?
-Doesn't matter. People saw them do it.

186
00:11:36,365 --> 00:11:38,773
Maybe they just pretended
to burn a flag.

187
00:11:38,952 --> 00:11:42,654
Get Penn and Teller to make a statement
saying they didn't burn the flag.

188
00:11:42,832 --> 00:11:46,249
I don't want flag questions chasing us
all the way to China.

189
00:11:46,462 --> 00:11:49,915
"We commend the Chinese government
for releasing Wen Jong, but hope--"

190
00:11:50,092 --> 00:11:52,798
-"Commend" is too strong a word.
-How about "encouraged"?

191
00:11:52,971 --> 00:11:55,463
-"We were encouraged by the Chinese. "
-That's better.

192
00:11:55,641 --> 00:11:57,350
I need a couple signatures.

193
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,437
We need to get that statement out
before we get on the plane.

194
00:12:00,606 --> 00:12:03,145
Could we talk about who China
should release next?

195
00:12:03,318 --> 00:12:05,276
We should focus on
what we won today.

196
00:12:05,571 --> 00:12:07,980
So a line about what we hope
they do in the future?

197
00:12:08,158 --> 00:12:10,068
Right. We need to tie it
into the summit.

198
00:12:10,244 --> 00:12:12,487
Like how it shows that the Chinese
are ready. . .

199
00:12:12,664 --> 00:12:15,785
. . .for real negotiations on all
of the issues on our agenda.

200
00:12:15,961 --> 00:12:18,583
-Let me look at that.
-We should check this with State.

201
00:12:18,756 --> 00:12:22,625
They'll want to have input on
any statement referring to the summit.

202
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,009
We'll get Penn and Teller
to put out a statement. . .

203
00:12:29,187 --> 00:12:32,059
. . .explaining that they didn't
really burn a flag.

204
00:12:32,233 --> 00:12:35,105
And ruin a perfectly good segment
of Crossfire tonight?

205
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:38,234
I didn't realize you wanted
all press-conference questions. . .

206
00:12:38,408 --> 00:12:40,615
. . .to be about flag burning
in the White House.

207
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:44,121
Want to see these Christmas party
invitations I'm declining for you?

208
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:46,664
Only ones you're accepting,
which I hope are none.

209
00:12:46,836 --> 00:12:48,995
-So far.
-Are wheels up yet?

210
00:12:49,173 --> 00:12:50,798
In four minutes.

211
00:12:50,967 --> 00:12:53,838
So that's like, what, 50 minutes
behind schedule?

212
00:12:54,013 --> 00:12:56,469
-Forty-eight.
-Okay, so you owe me. . . .

213
00:12:56,641 --> 00:12:58,765
No, no. You bet 45 or under,
and l--

214
00:12:58,936 --> 00:13:01,143
I'd never bet under 45
on a foreign trip.

215
00:13:01,314 --> 00:13:03,687
You really want to become a liar
over 3 bucks?

216
00:13:03,859 --> 00:13:06,434
-I'm late for Vinick.
-Not anymore, you're not.

217
00:13:06,989 --> 00:13:10,774
-Did he cancel?
-No, I just rescheduled it for you.

218
00:13:11,203 --> 00:13:14,039
-This better be good.
-Vinick's scheduler was fine with it.

219
00:13:14,207 --> 00:13:16,117
Did it occur to you
I'd have a problem--?

220
00:13:16,293 --> 00:13:20,043
She said later would actually be better
for the senator. He won't be rushed.

221
00:13:20,215 --> 00:13:22,125
-So?
-So Charlie needs you.

222
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:24,840
-Charlie?
-Obviously, that means it's a C.J. thing.

223
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:28,300
He's been passing along stuff
for her since she's been on the road.

224
00:13:28,476 --> 00:13:31,182
You can say "China trip. "
When you say "on the road" . . .

225
00:13:31,355 --> 00:13:33,515
. . .it screams avoiding
saying "China trip. "

226
00:13:33,692 --> 00:13:36,611
-Me, avoid saying something to you?
-Get two things straight:

227
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:40,446
First, I'm fine not going to China.
Picking a U.N. ambassador's a big thing.

228
00:13:40,618 --> 00:13:44,867
-You didn't pick him.
-Second, only I can reschedule Vinick.

229
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:48,376
To keep your ego intact, I've been
trying to avoid using the phrase:

230
00:13:48,546 --> 00:13:51,916
"Direct order from C.J. "
I'll take your coat.

231
00:13:57,558 --> 00:14:00,132
We will be landing in New Orleans
in 25 minutes.

232
00:14:00,312 --> 00:14:03,896
The press will be to your left as you exit
the plane.

233
00:14:05,319 --> 00:14:07,395
I have nothing more on the flag thing.

234
00:14:08,364 --> 00:14:11,117
C.J., I think we've used about enough
presidential time. . .

235
00:14:11,285 --> 00:14:14,905
. . .talking about a kid's birthday party.
What else you got, Kate?

236
00:14:15,082 --> 00:14:17,788
-Did they really burn the flag--?
-I don't know.

237
00:14:17,961 --> 00:14:21,165
I was in bed five minutes
after Zoey blew out the candles.

238
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,417
I have a draft statement for you
to look at.

239
00:14:23,594 --> 00:14:27,379
We really should get a statement out
before we land in New Orleans.

240
00:14:28,684 --> 00:14:34,440
"While I do not condone flag burning. . . .
I was not present when. . . . " It's too long.

241
00:14:34,609 --> 00:14:36,234
-Let me work on that.
-No, let me.

242
00:14:36,403 --> 00:14:38,396
-It was a private party.
-I'll stress that.

243
00:14:38,572 --> 00:14:40,233
No, that's it. That's my statement.

244
00:14:40,408 --> 00:14:43,695
-It was a private party, period.
-It was in the White House.

245
00:14:43,871 --> 00:14:46,577
-Underline "private. "
-It was in the East Room.

246
00:14:46,792 --> 00:14:48,417
There were 50 people there.

247
00:14:48,628 --> 00:14:50,954
I'm not getting into a national
shouting match. . .

248
00:14:51,131 --> 00:14:54,418
. . .about what happened
at my daughter's birthday party.

249
00:14:57,557 --> 00:15:00,761
-Landing in New Orleans in 20 minutes.
-Thank you.

250
00:15:01,312 --> 00:15:02,641
Go ahead, Kate.

251
00:15:02,814 --> 00:15:04,938
So you know,
I'm not comfortable with this.

252
00:15:05,109 --> 00:15:07,648
C.J. wanted to call,
but she got pulled into a thing.

253
00:15:07,821 --> 00:15:09,529
-On the plane.
-It's not just you.

254
00:15:09,698 --> 00:15:11,988
She's had me on the phone
with half the Cabinet.

255
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,367
She just can't make every
phone call herself.

256
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:17,161
She wants you to help out
on the flag-burning thing.

257
00:15:17,334 --> 00:15:20,336
-Instead of getting a U.N. ambassador?
-Not instead of. Before.

258
00:15:20,505 --> 00:15:22,332
Twenty-seven congressmen
signed this. . .

259
00:15:22,507 --> 00:15:26,293
. . .demanding the president explain what
happened. The story's on cable news.

260
00:15:26,471 --> 00:15:29,177
C.J.'s afraid it'll drown out
coverage of the China trip.

261
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:31,972
-She needs you to--
-Put out the fire?

262
00:15:32,146 --> 00:15:34,222
Did she actually say "put out the fire"?

263
00:15:35,942 --> 00:15:38,316
We're buried in calls
from the usual suspects. . .

264
00:15:38,529 --> 00:15:41,318
. . .plus Entertainment Tonight,
Access Hollywood...

265
00:15:41,492 --> 00:15:43,485
...Hollywood Reporter,
Magicians Monthly.

266
00:15:43,661 --> 00:15:46,498
Okay, why don't you track down
Penn and Teller. . .

267
00:15:46,665 --> 00:15:49,502
-. . .and get them on the phone.
-Them? Teller doesn't speak.

268
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:51,996
-It's an act.
-Penn told me Teller doesn't speak.

269
00:15:52,173 --> 00:15:54,380
-You talked to Penn?
-Right before you came in.

270
00:15:54,551 --> 00:15:57,968
He'll be here in a couple of hours.
Sounded pretty cooperative.

271
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:01,177
Okay. Who we kidding,
you don't need me in this thing.

272
00:16:01,352 --> 00:16:05,434
I wanted to give you the vice president's
statement about the flag burning.

273
00:16:05,608 --> 00:16:08,182
He wants to get it out this afternoon.

274
00:16:08,362 --> 00:16:11,317
"When I was in Congress,
I led the fight. . .

275
00:16:11,491 --> 00:16:14,030
. . .for a constitutional amendment
to ban flag burning.

276
00:16:14,203 --> 00:16:18,249
This obscene stunt once again points out
the urgent need for a constitutional--"

277
00:16:18,417 --> 00:16:22,001
Can this guy open his mouth
without pandering?

278
00:16:22,172 --> 00:16:24,843
Let me know when Penn and Teller
show up.

279
00:16:25,051 --> 00:16:26,380
I tried to talk him out--

280
00:16:26,553 --> 00:16:29,259
Donna, where's the OMB report
on the HHS budget?

281
00:16:29,432 --> 00:16:32,849
Where the OMB reports always are,
in the stack beside the thing.

282
00:16:33,021 --> 00:16:36,106
Right. Oh, and the supplements?

283
00:16:36,275 --> 00:16:38,434
Supplementary stack,
beside the other thing.

284
00:16:38,612 --> 00:16:41,103
Okay, I'm done helping you
ignore Will.

285
00:16:41,282 --> 00:16:45,233
How would you suggest the vice
president handle a flag burning?

286
00:16:45,454 --> 00:16:49,121
I would tell him to show a little loyalty
to the president and his family. . .

287
00:16:49,293 --> 00:16:52,295
. . .but then I'd have to explain to him
what loyalty is.

288
00:16:52,714 --> 00:16:54,458
Do you have time to do that now?

289
00:16:56,177 --> 00:16:58,087
He shook too many hands
in New Orleans. . .

290
00:16:58,263 --> 00:17:00,886
. . .but the pilot says we can make up
some lost time.

291
00:17:01,059 --> 00:17:05,010
Yes, China's definitely dumping shrimp
in the U.S. at below-cost prices. . .

292
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:11,312
. . .but so is Vietnam. So if we threaten
to bring a WTO case against China. . .

293
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:13,567
. . .then we have to threaten
Vietnam too.

294
00:17:13,785 --> 00:17:16,989
The U.S. threatening Vietnam could
wake up a lot of sleeping dogs.

295
00:17:17,206 --> 00:17:19,330
How much shrimp comes
from China and Vietnam?

296
00:17:19,501 --> 00:17:22,337
Twenty-five percent. There's no way
our domestic industry. . .

297
00:17:22,505 --> 00:17:25,341
. . .could replace that.
And it would only make it easier. . .

298
00:17:25,509 --> 00:17:27,917
. . .for Brazil to increase
their market share.

299
00:17:28,096 --> 00:17:30,932
I told those guys in New Orleans
that I would do something.

300
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:34,470
You will do something. You'll raise
the issue with the Chinese.

301
00:17:34,688 --> 00:17:36,100
Only the State Department. . .

302
00:17:36,274 --> 00:17:39,395
. . .thinks "raising the issue"
and "doing something" are the same.

303
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:43,403
I co-sponsored the flag-burning
amendment when the House voted on it.

304
00:17:43,575 --> 00:17:46,661
Big difference between being
a congressman and being VP.

305
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:49,238
I know, but I've got a lot of history
with this.

306
00:17:49,417 --> 00:17:51,659
Voters didn't know much about me. . .

307
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:55,088
. . .but what they did know was
that I was against flag burning.

308
00:17:55,258 --> 00:17:57,298
That's in one district in Colorado.

309
00:17:57,469 --> 00:18:01,136
You need to define yourself nationally.
You want to start with flag burning?

310
00:18:01,308 --> 00:18:04,809
-It's the story of the day.
-China summit's the story of the day.

311
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:08,314
If you don't have something to say about
U.S. relations with China. . .

312
00:18:08,526 --> 00:18:10,733
. . .why are you running for president?

313
00:18:10,904 --> 00:18:14,357
Voters understand loyalty. They're not
expecting you to take a shot. . .

314
00:18:14,534 --> 00:18:17,952
. . .at the president on something that
happened at his daughter's party.

315
00:18:18,164 --> 00:18:21,001
Baker is going to New Hampshire
to announce his candidacy.

316
00:18:21,168 --> 00:18:23,577
-The press is gonna ask him about this.
-lf Baker--

317
00:18:23,755 --> 00:18:28,300
lf? Baker has to jump on this. He needs
to move to the right on something.

318
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:32,006
So what? Do you think that helps either
one of you get the nomination?

319
00:18:32,184 --> 00:18:35,102
It's never too early to think about
the general.

320
00:18:35,271 --> 00:18:37,680
Mr. Vice President, have you seen
Baker's numbers?

321
00:18:37,858 --> 00:18:41,442
That's why I can't miss any opportunity,
like this flag thing.

322
00:18:41,613 --> 00:18:43,322
Baker's at 32. You're at 19.

323
00:18:43,491 --> 00:18:45,733
Hoynes and everyone else
are in single digits.

324
00:18:45,952 --> 00:18:50,034
You're not gonna catch up to Baker with
flag burning. Baker's just a governor.

325
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:53,501
He's gotta jump at every issue
to get coverage outside Pennsylvania.

326
00:18:53,671 --> 00:18:56,128
You're vice president
of the United States.

327
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:59,884
You can't go chasing every little
controversy that comes along.

328
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:02,671
You can't let Baker dictate
your agenda.

329
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:05,515
You pick your spots carefully,
every speech you give. . .

330
00:19:05,688 --> 00:19:08,358
. . .will be treated as breaking news
on CNN.

331
00:19:10,152 --> 00:19:13,024
I need you to pick those spots for me.

332
00:19:13,699 --> 00:19:17,069
Will's been telling me that you're the guy
to run this campaign.

333
00:19:17,245 --> 00:19:19,238
Now I can see why.

334
00:19:19,415 --> 00:19:21,539
They're ready for you now.

335
00:19:22,419 --> 00:19:24,329
-He's not stupid.
-That a bumper sticker?

336
00:19:24,505 --> 00:19:26,712
-He took your advice.
-That was a setup.

337
00:19:26,883 --> 00:19:31,132
No, it wasn't. He wanted to put out that
statement. I couldn't talk him out of it.

338
00:19:31,306 --> 00:19:34,474
Once I heard your take, it seemed
perfect to put you two together.

339
00:19:34,686 --> 00:19:37,308
It's a write-your-own-ticket offer.
Complete control.

340
00:19:37,523 --> 00:19:41,522
-You don't want to run it?
-I've never done a national campaign.

341
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:43,985
Baker's gonna chew him up
in the debates.

342
00:19:44,157 --> 00:19:46,779
Even Hoynes will run rings around him
on the issues.

343
00:19:46,994 --> 00:19:51,243
The VP will be the only guy with enough
money to hang in there against Baker.

344
00:19:51,459 --> 00:19:53,037
-What about Hoynes?
-Damaged goods.

345
00:19:53,211 --> 00:19:56,130
So you think it's a two-man race
by Super Tuesday?

346
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:59,793
Right. And Baker's not gonna
play well in the South.

347
00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:02,753
I heard Hoynes made you an offer.

348
00:20:04,226 --> 00:20:06,896
-Has Baker called you?
-Bruno runs Baker's campaigns.

349
00:20:07,063 --> 00:20:09,222
Bob Russell might be
the next president.

350
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,604
You get in now, you can make him
the candidate you want him to be.

351
00:20:12,821 --> 00:20:16,488
After that, we make him the president
we need him to be.

352
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,168
-Where is Vinick's office?
-Dirksen 464.

353
00:20:25,338 --> 00:20:27,628
-Thanks.
-Got Penn and Teller's statement.

354
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,636
-Let's see.
-You're not gonna love it.

355
00:20:32,139 --> 00:20:34,382
How about after the Vinick meeting?

356
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,600
-For what?
-For me, for that talk we were--

357
00:20:36,771 --> 00:20:39,559
"Supreme Court ruled we can do
what we want with the flag.

358
00:20:39,733 --> 00:20:43,946
And the Founding Fathers obviously
intended--" Are they still here?

359
00:20:44,114 --> 00:20:47,365
Juggling identical objects,
identical weights is pretty easy. . .

360
00:20:47,535 --> 00:20:49,410
. . .with about five years' practice.

361
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:53,116
But juggling different weights,
different shapes. . .

362
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:57,244
. . .stuff you got off people's desks,
stuff you haven't practiced with. . .

363
00:20:57,424 --> 00:21:00,711
-. . .that's when it gets a little bit tricky.
-That's amazing.

364
00:21:00,929 --> 00:21:03,681
This statement does me absolutely
no good.

365
00:21:03,891 --> 00:21:06,846
I need a statement saying exactly
what you did last night.

366
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:11,399
Preferably that you did not burn a flag.
And if you did actually burn a flag. . .

367
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:15,526
. . .I need you to admit it and emphasize
that you did not clear your act. . .

368
00:21:15,699 --> 00:21:18,986
. . .with anyone in the White House,
and had you done so. . .

369
00:21:19,162 --> 00:21:22,117
. . .you now realize you would have
been explicitly forbidden. . .

370
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:25,335
. . .to burn a flag in the White House,
and you now regret. . .

371
00:21:25,504 --> 00:21:28,174
. . .this controversy
and apologize to the president. . .

372
00:21:28,341 --> 00:21:31,925
. . .and his family for treating his home
with such disrespect.

373
00:21:32,388 --> 00:21:37,633
-Hi. I'm Penn Jillette. This is Teller.
-Hi. Josh Lyman. How you doing?

374
00:21:37,854 --> 00:21:39,230
He doesn't talk.

375
00:21:39,398 --> 00:21:42,186
Doesn't talk, like Harpo Marx,
or really doesn't talk?

376
00:21:42,402 --> 00:21:46,567
-What's the difference?
-Okay. How did you do the flag trick?

377
00:21:46,741 --> 00:21:48,782
-We're not gonna tell you that.
-Fine.

378
00:21:48,953 --> 00:21:50,946
So if Annabeth goes out there
and says. . .

379
00:21:51,122 --> 00:21:54,658
. . .that you did not burn a flag last night,
no one can refute that.

380
00:21:54,836 --> 00:21:58,372
Except the people who saw them burn
a flag, or think that's what they saw.

381
00:21:58,591 --> 00:22:01,427
You tell me, Charlie. Did we burn a flag,
or did we just. . .

382
00:22:01,595 --> 00:22:05,677
-. . .vanish a flag in a flash of fireworks?
-Don't know.

383
00:22:05,892 --> 00:22:08,848
-What's the difference?
-There's a big difference politically.

384
00:22:09,022 --> 00:22:11,893
Why? I mean, what if we burned a flag
not in protest. . .

385
00:22:12,068 --> 00:22:16,862
. . .but in celebration of the very freedoms
that allow us to burn a flag. . .

386
00:22:17,074 --> 00:22:20,611
. . .the freedoms that everyone who
has ever worked in this building. . .

387
00:22:20,788 --> 00:22:23,706
. . .has pledged to preserve and protect?

388
00:22:25,878 --> 00:22:29,498
-Did you go to law school?
-No. Clown school.

389
00:22:32,178 --> 00:22:37,175
Let's find a compromise on shrimp that
I can ask the Chinese to offer Vietnam.

390
00:22:37,352 --> 00:22:40,557
Something that nudges both of them
closer to fair price levels.

391
00:22:40,732 --> 00:22:44,268
Okay, everyone. The president has
a phone call to make.

392
00:22:59,674 --> 00:23:01,549
-What was all that about?
-You okay?

393
00:23:01,719 --> 00:23:03,344
-I'm fine.
-You're not eating.

394
00:23:03,763 --> 00:23:06,682
-I'm not that hungry.
-You said you were hungry earlier.

395
00:23:06,851 --> 00:23:10,636
Don't worry. I'll eat.
But thanks for getting rid of them.

396
00:23:10,856 --> 00:23:13,527
Sixteen more hours of that
would be a bit much.

397
00:23:13,735 --> 00:23:16,358
Send Milly in. I don't need
to talk shop with her.

398
00:23:16,572 --> 00:23:18,566
Yes, sir.

399
00:23:23,332 --> 00:23:25,871
The senator will see you now.

400
00:23:44,694 --> 00:23:46,688
Mr. Chairman.

401
00:23:47,406 --> 00:23:48,901
Shine your own shoes, Josh?

402
00:23:49,701 --> 00:23:51,493
No, I can't say that I do.

403
00:23:51,662 --> 00:23:56,705
My father used to say you can't trust
a man who doesn't shine his own shoes.

404
00:23:58,004 --> 00:24:01,754
-Does anybody shine those things?
-Not really. No.

405
00:24:01,968 --> 00:24:04,590
How many guys left in this town
shine their own shoes?

406
00:24:05,097 --> 00:24:07,007
-Not a lot.
-None.

407
00:24:07,225 --> 00:24:10,595
-Is that how many you trust?
-That's exactly how many I trust.

408
00:24:10,813 --> 00:24:12,688
-Mr. Chairman--
-I know what you're thinking.

409
00:24:12,899 --> 00:24:16,436
"Must be Ionely being this mean old guy
who doesn't trust anyone. "

410
00:24:16,655 --> 00:24:19,229
Well, I trust my brother,
my four children. . .

411
00:24:19,408 --> 00:24:22,909
. . .my nine grandchildren
and my dog.

412
00:24:24,332 --> 00:24:26,242
I suspect that's more than
you trust. . .

413
00:24:26,418 --> 00:24:27,913
-. . .now isn't it?
-Yeah.

414
00:24:28,087 --> 00:24:31,956
The Founding Fathers didn't set up
a government based on trust.

415
00:24:32,134 --> 00:24:35,469
They could've designed a government
based on trust. . .

416
00:24:35,681 --> 00:24:40,428
. . .but they knew that power corrupts.
So they invented checks and balances.

417
00:24:42,106 --> 00:24:44,016
That was genius.

418
00:24:44,568 --> 00:24:47,356
The Founding Fathers did not
want me to trust you. . .

419
00:24:47,572 --> 00:24:50,325
. . .and they did not want you
to trust me.

420
00:24:51,035 --> 00:24:53,609
Well, they must be very proud of us.

421
00:24:55,917 --> 00:24:56,948
Have a seat.

422
00:24:57,127 --> 00:24:59,120
Oh, we're still negotiating Christmas.

423
00:24:59,338 --> 00:25:04,679
Tommy wants to go on an archaeological
dig with some heathen professor of his.

424
00:25:04,887 --> 00:25:07,011
And Cleo's doing Christmas
with her dad.

425
00:25:07,224 --> 00:25:09,977
Then do Christmas with
your goddaughter and her family.

426
00:25:10,186 --> 00:25:14,020
I can't afford another Bartlet Christmas
on this government salary.

427
00:25:14,192 --> 00:25:16,897
Way too many presents.

428
00:25:17,446 --> 00:25:20,068
Milly, I can't move my hands.

429
00:25:24,998 --> 00:25:28,582
-Ever happen before?
-It's usually one or the other.

430
00:25:28,753 --> 00:25:30,378
-Never both?
-No.

431
00:25:37,432 --> 00:25:40,968
-You feel that?
-No.

432
00:25:43,857 --> 00:25:46,528
-Anything?
-No.

433
00:25:46,694 --> 00:25:49,269
You want me to bring
in the flight doctor?

434
00:25:49,448 --> 00:25:51,655
Not unless it gets worse.

435
00:25:55,123 --> 00:25:59,502
Well, I guess I'm gonna have
to feed you then, aren't I?

436
00:26:07,223 --> 00:26:11,352
Every White House forgets about checks
and balances. You guys are no different.

437
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,679
It's the witch hunts
I got a problem with.

438
00:26:13,857 --> 00:26:16,395
You'll need cordovan for those.
Pick up a brush.

439
00:26:16,569 --> 00:26:19,654
You're not leaving this room
with shoes like that.

440
00:26:19,823 --> 00:26:22,149
Here's another check you won't like.

441
00:26:22,327 --> 00:26:24,818
I'm holding another hearing
on your man, Margudian. . .

442
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:27,744
. . .taking a Marine helicopter
to play golf in Florida.

443
00:26:27,959 --> 00:26:31,793
-That was a year ago. We fired the guy.
-This was another incident before that.

444
00:26:32,006 --> 00:26:34,214
-You think the American people care?
-Hope not.

445
00:26:34,635 --> 00:26:39,049
But 12 members of my committee do,
or think it's a good way to get on TV.

446
00:26:39,392 --> 00:26:42,678
-You think I like investigating this stuff?
-Fooled me.

447
00:26:42,855 --> 00:26:46,770
Have I ever campaigned saying I'd be
the best investigator in the Senate?

448
00:26:46,985 --> 00:26:49,608
Of course not.
This isn't what I came here to do.

449
00:26:49,822 --> 00:26:52,445
I came here to make this
a better country.

450
00:26:52,618 --> 00:26:56,119
I wish you guys would stop serving up
these things for us to investigate.

451
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:58,497
-We've run a pretty tight ship.
-Yes, you have.

452
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:01,914
Which is why they had to go back
a few years to find something new.

453
00:27:02,131 --> 00:27:04,041
But just do me a big favor, will you?

454
00:27:04,259 --> 00:27:06,751
No more flag burnings
in the White House.

455
00:27:06,929 --> 00:27:09,717
I've had four nuts demand hearings
on that one already.

456
00:27:09,933 --> 00:27:13,553
-So?
-So I told them that the U.S. Senate. . .

457
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:18,026
. . .does not investigate what happens
at kids' birthday parties.

458
00:27:18,654 --> 00:27:21,192
Not as long as I have
anything to say about it.

459
00:27:22,993 --> 00:27:24,986
Have you decided
if you're gonna run again?

460
00:27:25,162 --> 00:27:30,159
Yep. Flying home tonight, making
my announcement tomorrow.

461
00:27:31,129 --> 00:27:33,455
Why, you want to make me
a retirement offer?

462
00:27:33,674 --> 00:27:35,632
Yeah, I happen to have one on me.

463
00:27:37,137 --> 00:27:38,762
-What?
-Help the president. . .

464
00:27:38,931 --> 00:27:42,052
. . .make the world a better place.

465
00:27:42,645 --> 00:27:44,768
U.N.

466
00:27:46,191 --> 00:27:49,526
That's tempting. It's very tempting.

467
00:27:50,864 --> 00:27:52,407
But that's not the job I want.

468
00:27:52,617 --> 00:27:55,821
The president didn't send me
with a menu of jobs. Just this one.

469
00:27:56,038 --> 00:27:59,040
-President can't give me the job I want.
-Which one?

470
00:28:00,002 --> 00:28:01,331
His.

471
00:28:07,137 --> 00:28:09,711
-You're running?
-Starting tomorrow.

472
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:12,561
You missed a spot on the heel.

473
00:28:13,729 --> 00:28:16,601
The only thing to do is let him rest.
He could feel fine. . .

474
00:28:16,775 --> 00:28:20,192
-. . .by the time he gets off the plane.
-Or he could get worse.

475
00:28:20,363 --> 00:28:24,113
Well, if this is as bad as it gets,
no one will notice a thing.

476
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:28,580
Except when he has to shake hands,
which he has to do 200 times tomorrow.

477
00:28:28,791 --> 00:28:30,749
It'd be good to minimize
the handshaking.

478
00:28:30,961 --> 00:28:32,835
We should cancel the first reception.

479
00:28:33,005 --> 00:28:35,758
You know how long the protocol
officers spent on that one?

480
00:28:35,926 --> 00:28:38,299
Public events are the ones
the Chinese care about.

481
00:28:38,471 --> 00:28:41,639
If the president can't publicly
shake hands with a head of state--

482
00:28:41,809 --> 00:28:43,434
It'd kill the flag-burning story.

483
00:28:43,645 --> 00:28:46,398
-Could we get Abbey on the phone?
-Yeah.

484
00:28:46,858 --> 00:28:49,065
-Who else should we call?
-For an MS patient. . .

485
00:28:49,236 --> 00:28:51,692
. . .this is the equivalent
of a headache.

486
00:28:51,864 --> 00:28:55,566
I mean, who would you want us to call
if you had a headache?

487
00:28:57,831 --> 00:29:00,786
Okay. Let's just keep this on the plane
for now.

488
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,793
-I thought you'd be long gone.
-More junk here than I thought.

489
00:29:04,966 --> 00:29:07,837
Shouldn't you still be, you know,
taking it easy?

490
00:29:08,053 --> 00:29:11,388
I think a long nap qualifies as taking
it easy. Did you hook Vinick?

491
00:29:11,558 --> 00:29:14,513
-Not exactly.
-He's gonna run for another term.

492
00:29:14,687 --> 00:29:17,060
I don't know much about heart stuff. . .

493
00:29:17,274 --> 00:29:19,398
. . .but aren't you supposed--?
Maybe we--

494
00:29:19,611 --> 00:29:21,569
You're not gonna shock me
into my grave.

495
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:23,275
He's running for president.

496
00:29:24,576 --> 00:29:27,993
-He announces tomorrow.
-President?

497
00:29:29,249 --> 00:29:32,204
I don't see how he gets
the nomination.

498
00:29:32,587 --> 00:29:35,708
What's he gonna run on?
Tax cuts and more tax cuts?

499
00:29:35,883 --> 00:29:38,256
Every Republican candidate
will be for tax cuts.

500
00:29:38,428 --> 00:29:42,130
-Then what? Flip-flop on abortion?
-He's against late-term abortion.

501
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:45,934
-Won't work for the Republican base.
-A lot of California money behind him.

502
00:29:46,105 --> 00:29:49,641
-Even if he raises twice as much--
-Eric Baker's live on MSNBC right now.

503
00:29:49,819 --> 00:29:52,524
Says he's not running.

504
00:29:55,243 --> 00:29:59,324
And so I have decided for family reasons
that this is not that time.

505
00:29:59,499 --> 00:30:01,658
It's the time that I can keep
my commitment...

506
00:30:01,835 --> 00:30:04,790
... to the people of Pennsylvania
to be a full-time governor...

507
00:30:04,964 --> 00:30:08,002
...and the commitment to my family
to be a full-time father.

508
00:30:08,177 --> 00:30:10,384
-Family reasons?
-Unbelievable.

509
00:30:10,555 --> 00:30:13,308
Well, I never decided to get into
the presidential race...

510
00:30:13,476 --> 00:30:16,015
...so I can 't see how you can say
I dropped out of it.

511
00:30:16,188 --> 00:30:20,021
-How lucky can we get?
-You're never gonna get luckier than this.

512
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:22,816
Milly says you should use the flight
to rest.

513
00:30:22,989 --> 00:30:24,484
-No more meetings.
-Thanks.

514
00:30:24,658 --> 00:30:27,364
-I won't interrupt you for anything.
-Fine by me.

515
00:30:27,537 --> 00:30:29,744
Mr. President, Baker just dropped out.

516
00:30:30,291 --> 00:30:33,328
-Baker's not running?
-It looks like our very own Bob Russell. . .

517
00:30:33,503 --> 00:30:36,174
. . .is the new frontrunner
for the Democratic nomination.

518
00:30:36,341 --> 00:30:39,627
Toby, please. Sir, this is exactly
what we're not going to do.

519
00:30:39,804 --> 00:30:41,963
You need rest.
We won't bring you anything. . .

520
00:30:42,182 --> 00:30:44,756
. . .you don't need to know
immediately.

521
00:30:45,436 --> 00:30:47,975
But we mean real rest,
not studying briefing books.

522
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:50,764
-Are you gonna watch me rest?
-lf I have to.

523
00:30:50,986 --> 00:30:52,611
Get out of here.

524
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:56,197
-Family reasons.
-Go figure.

525
00:30:56,368 --> 00:30:59,038
-He's close to Vinick, you know.
-No, I didn't know.

526
00:30:59,205 --> 00:31:02,991
Yeah. Baker was on the Judiciary
Committee staff back when Vinick. . .

527
00:31:03,169 --> 00:31:06,088
. . .was a freshman senator.
They've been tight ever since.

528
00:31:06,298 --> 00:31:09,503
So? Since when have you seen friendship
trump ambition in politics?

529
00:31:09,678 --> 00:31:12,929
Maybe Baker figures the Democratic
nomination's not worth winning. . .

530
00:31:13,099 --> 00:31:15,009
. . .if he's against Vinick
in the general.

531
00:31:15,227 --> 00:31:17,684
But there's no way Vinick's
getting the nomination.

532
00:31:17,856 --> 00:31:23,528
I'm just saying, Baker's not sitting
this out for family reasons.

533
00:31:24,615 --> 00:31:27,451
Could be Vinick.
Could be something else.

534
00:31:27,828 --> 00:31:31,364
-Who's our frontrunner with Baker out?
-Run a poll without Baker in it. . .

535
00:31:31,541 --> 00:31:34,958
. . .and Russell's gonna go sky-high.

536
00:31:35,129 --> 00:31:38,665
-Hoynes will pop too.
-Russell or Hoynes gets our nomination.

537
00:31:38,843 --> 00:31:42,011
-Who gets the Republican nomination?
-That's wide open.

538
00:31:42,222 --> 00:31:45,390
They've been out of power for
eight years, and they're desperate.

539
00:31:46,395 --> 00:31:48,721
Probably why Vinick figures
he has a shot.

540
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,767
You're serious?

541
00:31:51,443 --> 00:31:55,988
Ever see Arnie Vinick campaign?
Up close?

542
00:31:56,158 --> 00:31:58,317
He'll go into those
high school gymnasiums. . .

543
00:31:58,495 --> 00:32:02,197
. . .in Iowa and New Hampshire
and blow them all away.

544
00:32:02,375 --> 00:32:04,867
Shake every hand in the joint,
kiss every baby. . .

545
00:32:05,045 --> 00:32:08,166
. . .hug every widow
on Social Security. . .

546
00:32:08,341 --> 00:32:13,254
. . .and sound smarter and more honest
than any Republican they've ever seen. . .

547
00:32:13,432 --> 00:32:15,555
. . .because he is.

548
00:32:15,852 --> 00:32:18,474
He could win in the early states.

549
00:32:18,647 --> 00:32:21,056
Go into the South
with some momentum.

550
00:32:21,276 --> 00:32:22,984
Then. . .

551
00:32:24,113 --> 00:32:27,068
. . .who knows what happens?

552
00:32:29,287 --> 00:32:33,582
Republican who wins California wipes
us out in the Electoral College.

553
00:32:33,751 --> 00:32:35,329
Right.

554
00:32:37,006 --> 00:32:38,999
He's not getting the nomination.

555
00:32:39,175 --> 00:32:43,803
If he does, we've got no one
who can beat him.

556
00:32:50,608 --> 00:32:53,444
And so I have returned. . .

557
00:32:53,612 --> 00:32:58,952
. . .to the place where my career in public
service began, right here at city hall. . .

558
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:05,242
. . .to announce my candidacy to be the
next president of the United States.

559
00:33:07,839 --> 00:33:09,963
And I ask you--

560
00:33:10,134 --> 00:33:14,085
I ask all of you who have been with me
from the beginning. . .

561
00:33:14,307 --> 00:33:17,558
... to set out with me today
from this valley on this new quest...

562
00:33:17,978 --> 00:33:20,980
... to help me bring the promise
and the opportunity...

563
00:33:21,149 --> 00:33:23,439
...of America to all Americans.

564
00:33:23,653 --> 00:33:27,486
Do you think you're conservative enough
to get the Republican nomination?

565
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:31,117
I think I'm Republican enough.
I've been a lifelong Republican.

566
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:33,157
Always been loyal to the party.

567
00:33:33,374 --> 00:33:35,166
Should the president investigate. . .

568
00:33:35,335 --> 00:33:37,329
. . .a flag being burned
in the White House?

569
00:33:37,505 --> 00:33:41,338
No. I accept the president's statement
that it was a private party.

570
00:33:41,552 --> 00:33:44,887
-We don 't need to hear about it.
-Don 't people have a right to know--?

571
00:33:45,057 --> 00:33:47,596
People should know
the president's position on issues.

572
00:33:47,769 --> 00:33:51,353
But they don 't have the right to know
what happens at his daughter's party.

573
00:33:51,566 --> 00:33:55,399
-But if they burned a flag--
-I think this is a perfect demonstration...

574
00:33:55,613 --> 00:33:58,401
. . .of what the president is flying
around the world now. . .

575
00:33:58,575 --> 00:34:00,783
. . .to try to teach the Chinese
government:

576
00:34:00,954 --> 00:34:02,283
The meaning of freedom.

577
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:05,369
It's good the magicians didn 't try
this trick in China...

578
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:08,996
... with the Chinese flag wrapped
in the Chinese Bill of Rights.

579
00:34:09,257 --> 00:34:11,546
Because there is no Chinese
Bill of Rights.

580
00:34:11,718 --> 00:34:13,926
-Senator! Senator!
-Thank you. Thank you.

581
00:34:14,138 --> 00:34:17,224
You have a year to talk me out
of voting for him.

582
00:34:23,902 --> 00:34:26,394
We've reached our cruising altitude
of 41,000 feet.

583
00:34:26,572 --> 00:34:29,658
We're anticipating a smooth ride
over the Pacific tonight.

584
00:34:29,868 --> 00:34:33,535
We'll be passing the Hawaiian Ridge
to our south in approximately an hour...

585
00:34:33,707 --> 00:34:36,199
...and as always, I'll give you
a reminder as we....

586
00:34:36,377 --> 00:34:38,205
-We've got a situation.
-What?

587
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:40,207
South Korea.

588
00:34:51,314 --> 00:34:53,806
-I thought you were gonna let me rest.
-Sorry, sir.

589
00:34:53,985 --> 00:34:55,859
State got a heads-up from the IAEA. . .

590
00:34:56,029 --> 00:34:58,603
. . .that they're gonna report
that South Korea. . .

591
00:34:58,783 --> 00:35:01,868
. . .has admitted to conducting
an experiment to enrich uranium.

592
00:35:02,037 --> 00:35:04,161
South Korea is not releasing
any details.

593
00:35:04,332 --> 00:35:07,667
We need you to get on the phone
and get the president to come clean.

594
00:35:07,837 --> 00:35:11,041
We can't ask China to help stop
North Korean nuclear experiments. . .

595
00:35:11,217 --> 00:35:13,459
. . .if the South is doing it too.

596
00:35:14,846 --> 00:35:17,469
Get us a secure line
with the South Korean president.

597
00:35:17,767 --> 00:35:19,143
C.J. . .

598
00:35:19,853 --> 00:35:21,894
. . .hold it.

599
00:35:22,065 --> 00:35:23,441
Sir?

600
00:35:23,608 --> 00:35:25,851
I can't move.

601
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:44,470
Progressive paralysis.
He had trouble with his hands.

602
00:35:44,637 --> 00:35:46,429
Now it's both legs and his right arm.

603
00:35:46,598 --> 00:35:49,304
So much for being staff-dependent
in China.

604
00:35:49,477 --> 00:35:51,387
Fairbanks is closer.
Anchorage is better.

605
00:35:51,563 --> 00:35:53,972
I've got better doctors up here
than I'd get there.

606
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:55,811
We can't take the chance--

607
00:35:55,986 --> 00:35:59,606
-We knew this was gonna happen.
-No, Mr. President, I didn't know.

608
00:35:59,783 --> 00:36:02,619
I mean, we always knew it was gonna
happen someday.

609
00:36:02,829 --> 00:36:06,531
-I'm ready for it. You better be too.
-Sir, we can't land in China with you--

610
00:36:06,751 --> 00:36:10,335
This plane is going to China.

611
00:36:11,215 --> 00:36:14,134
That's a direct order from
your commander in chief.

612
00:36:16,013 --> 00:36:19,300
Okay, we're gonna need to clear
the room for some tests.

613
00:36:32,369 --> 00:36:34,742
Some new numbers.

614
00:36:35,624 --> 00:36:39,872
Tracking poll has us up 16 points
with Baker out of the race.

615
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:47,260
-Hoynes is up too.
-Yeah, but we picked up a lot more.

616
00:36:47,431 --> 00:36:50,006
Russell's the man to beat now.

617
00:36:50,185 --> 00:36:51,810
Yep.

618
00:36:52,563 --> 00:36:56,515
Listen, we have a breakfast tomorrow
with senior campaign staff. Drop by.

619
00:36:56,736 --> 00:37:00,023
It doesn't commit you to anything.
Be a fly on the wall if you want.

620
00:37:00,199 --> 00:37:03,403
-See how it feels.
-No, thanks.

621
00:37:07,876 --> 00:37:09,335
This isn't a Broadway show.

622
00:37:09,503 --> 00:37:13,503
We don't just close it down
after a successful eight-year run.

623
00:37:13,676 --> 00:37:16,631
You have to care who'll be
in that chair after Bartlet's gone.

624
00:37:16,805 --> 00:37:18,845
I do.

625
00:37:19,225 --> 00:37:22,393
That's why I don't want
Bob Russell to be president.

626
00:37:42,882 --> 00:37:46,087
Hopefully the doctors will influence him
and get us turned around.

627
00:37:46,262 --> 00:37:49,347
We turn this plane around,
and that's the end of his presidency.

628
00:37:49,558 --> 00:37:52,346
-It'd say he can't do the job.
-We'd be saying he's sick.

629
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,514
We'll go back to China
when he's up to it.

630
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:57,182
We might as well just say
he's a part-time president.

631
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,899
He can only do the job
when he feels up to it!

632
00:38:00,114 --> 00:38:02,653
You really think he'll let you
turn this plane around?

633
00:38:02,826 --> 00:38:06,872
If we cancel, China might not believe us.
They'll think it's because South Korea. . .

634
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,245
. . .got caught working
on nuclear weapons.

635
00:38:10,462 --> 00:38:13,250
We gotta do full disclosure on this.

636
00:38:15,427 --> 00:38:18,382
Milly should do a full press briefing,
all the medical facts.

637
00:38:18,556 --> 00:38:21,344
Right here on this plane.
Just as soon as we know what. . . .

638
00:38:21,811 --> 00:38:23,970
He knew.

639
00:38:24,189 --> 00:38:26,396
That's why the surgeon general's
on the flight.

640
00:38:26,567 --> 00:38:30,613
He wanted her here to do the briefing.
He knew this might happen.

641
00:38:31,031 --> 00:38:32,740
We're three hours from Beijing.

642
00:38:32,951 --> 00:38:35,525
If we turn around,
we're gonna have to refuel.

643
00:38:35,705 --> 00:38:39,241
Maybe we should let the cockpit
start checking their options.

644
00:38:39,418 --> 00:38:43,998
-Yeah, okay.
-He wants to see you. All of you.

645
00:38:52,352 --> 00:38:56,102
Not there. In the infirmary.

646
00:38:59,904 --> 00:39:02,942
I just got off the phone with
President Wang of South Korea.

647
00:39:03,117 --> 00:39:05,787
He insists he didn't know
about the nuclear experiment.

648
00:39:05,996 --> 00:39:08,452
Says it was a couple
of curious young scientists.

649
00:39:08,625 --> 00:39:12,374
And they only enriched about
two-tenths of a gram of uranium.

650
00:39:12,547 --> 00:39:15,632
That's not nearly enough for
weapons-grade enrichment, is it?

651
00:39:15,801 --> 00:39:19,717
No, sir. Weapons-grade would have to be
at least 90 percent higher than that.

652
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:23,936
Okay. Wang says they're cooperating
fully with the IAEA inspectors.

653
00:39:24,104 --> 00:39:28,186
He's ordered these young scientists to
participate in a joint press conference. . .

654
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:31,196
. . .with the inspectors tomorrow,
then he's gonna fire them.

655
00:39:31,406 --> 00:39:34,657
-It won't make North Korea feel better.
-I know, but it's a start.

656
00:39:34,827 --> 00:39:38,447
C.J., we gotta set up
a quick press briefing. . .

657
00:39:38,624 --> 00:39:44,546
-. . .for the gang in the back of the plane.
-Mr. President, are you. . .?

658
00:39:45,467 --> 00:39:49,217
My left hand is back. I still have
no feeling in my legs. . .

659
00:39:49,389 --> 00:39:52,225
. . .and my right arm's in no shape
to be shaking hands.

660
00:39:52,434 --> 00:39:54,475
Remember to tell
the protocol officer that.

661
00:39:54,688 --> 00:39:57,310
-Are you in pain?
-No, as long as I don't attempt. . .

662
00:39:57,483 --> 00:40:00,853
. . .any superhuman feat like, say,
writing my name.

663
00:40:01,447 --> 00:40:03,855
Okay, let's get started.

664
00:40:04,367 --> 00:40:08,580
Think anyone's gonna ask about
that flag-burning thing now?

665
00:40:08,748 --> 00:40:12,000
All right, when we get out there,
I'll lead off with the MS thing. . .

666
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:13,499
. . .then discuss South Korea.

667
00:40:13,672 --> 00:40:16,294
I'll leave it to you, Milly,
to give medical details. . .

668
00:40:16,467 --> 00:40:20,680
-. . .if anyone has questions about that.
-I think they might have a few hundred.

669
00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:24,972
I'm just gonna say that the president
will be working from a wheelchair again.

670
00:40:25,146 --> 00:40:26,854
-Again?
-FDR.

671
00:40:27,023 --> 00:40:28,815
Do I have to remind those kids. . .

672
00:40:28,984 --> 00:40:31,441
. . .that Roosevelt fought WWII
from a wheelchair?

673
00:40:31,655 --> 00:40:33,732
-Yeah, but. . . .
-But he died in office.

674
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:36,738
Okay, I'll skip the Roosevelt bit.

675
00:40:37,538 --> 00:40:40,575
Bring that thing over here, would you?

676
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:47,085
How much you want to bet I can get
them to ask about South Korea?

677
00:40:49,471 --> 00:40:50,966
How much you got?

678
00:40:59,067 --> 00:41:02,734
Sorry to wake you up, but the president
has an announcement to make.

679
00:41:10,583 --> 00:41:13,122
No, no. I'll take it from here.

680
00:42:12,459 --> 00:42:16,589
Ladies and gentlemen,
the president of the United States.

681
00:42:17,305 --> 00:43:17,415
