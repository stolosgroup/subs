1
00:00:04,675 --> 00:00:06,816
Previously on "Superman & Lois"...

2
00:00:06,821 --> 00:00:08,621
Your mom wanted us
to move to Smallville.

3
00:00:08,626 --> 00:00:09,826
- It's a simpler life.
- _

4
00:00:09,831 --> 00:00:11,498
What does Morgan Edge
want with Smallville?

5
00:00:11,502 --> 00:00:13,637
He's retrofitting the coal mines.

6
00:00:13,642 --> 00:00:15,709
He's gonna put a lot of folks
back to work around here.

7
00:00:15,713 --> 00:00:17,713
That ship brought me to Earth.

8
00:00:17,718 --> 00:00:19,329
I had certain powers.

9
00:00:19,334 --> 00:00:21,535
You're saying you're Superman?

10
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:23,439
- That's my girlfriend!
- Back off!

11
00:00:23,444 --> 00:00:25,677
I felt something come over me.

12
00:00:25,682 --> 00:00:27,515
You can't see through lead.

13
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,694
The only remnants of
your real home are kryptonite.

14
00:00:30,699 --> 00:00:33,297
I'll start the upgrades
to your armor right away,

15
00:00:33,302 --> 00:00:34,901
Captain Luthor.

16
00:00:36,914 --> 00:00:40,413
What can you say about
leaving a place you loved?

17

18
00:00:49,827 --> 00:00:51,357
All the memories.

19
00:00:55,066 --> 00:00:56,829
All the experiences.

20
00:00:59,971 --> 00:01:02,334
It can be heartbreaking...

21
00:01:19,356 --> 00:01:21,687
Until the excitement takes over...

22
00:01:23,827 --> 00:01:25,591
Because you soon realize

23
00:01:25,596 --> 00:01:27,593
you get to make new memories...

24
00:01:31,034 --> 00:01:32,898
Have new experiences...

25
00:01:35,272 --> 00:01:39,477
I just need the wrench.
Thanks for the help, boys.

26
00:01:44,181 --> 00:01:45,744
And best of all...

27
00:01:47,318 --> 00:01:49,415
Fall in love all over again.

28
00:01:57,927 --> 00:01:59,490
The playbook never arrived?

29
00:01:59,495 --> 00:02:02,293
It should have been here
when we moved in.

30
00:02:02,298 --> 00:02:04,898
I don't know how I'm supposed
to know the plays.

31
00:02:04,903 --> 00:02:06,166
Whatever.

32
00:02:06,171 --> 00:02:07,735
You want me to call Coach Gaines?

33
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,103
No, no, it's fine.

34
00:02:09,108 --> 00:02:11,098
I only got two of
the AP classes I wanted,

35
00:02:11,103 --> 00:02:13,103
and they put me in Spanish
instead of French.

36
00:02:13,108 --> 00:02:14,608
I haven't even looked
at my schedule yet.

37
00:02:14,612 --> 00:02:16,808
Yeah, I'm sure it's
just as crappy as mine.

38
00:02:16,813 --> 00:02:19,044
We actually wanted to talk
to you about school, anyway.

39
00:02:19,048 --> 00:02:21,882
We have some concerns
with you going right now.

40
00:02:22,685 --> 00:02:24,081
Isn't that why we moved here?

41
00:02:24,086 --> 00:02:25,583
No, we came here so that your father

42
00:02:25,587 --> 00:02:26,717
and I would be around more

43
00:02:26,722 --> 00:02:28,720
and we'd have more time
to spend together as a family.

44
00:02:28,724 --> 00:02:30,354
And to live in a safer place

45
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:32,076
for me to teach you about your powers

46
00:02:32,081 --> 00:02:33,478
and the reason you have them.

47
00:02:33,483 --> 00:02:34,659
Well, what do I need to learn?

48
00:02:34,663 --> 00:02:37,648
- I'm a little stronger. So what?
- You're a lot stronger,

49
00:02:37,653 --> 00:02:41,319
and you've had
an ocular release of energy.

50
00:02:41,324 --> 00:02:42,353
A what?

51
00:02:42,358 --> 00:02:43,888
Is that seriously what it's called?

52
00:02:43,893 --> 00:02:44,925
It doesn't matter what it's called.

53
00:02:44,929 --> 00:02:46,225
He almost hurt a bunch of kids.

54
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:48,299
It was an accident. I don't
even know how it happened.

55
00:02:48,303 --> 00:02:49,708
That's exactly our point.

56
00:02:49,713 --> 00:02:51,476
So I'm just not gonna go to school?

57
00:02:51,481 --> 00:02:55,516
Until we know how to keep it
from happening again, yes.

58
00:02:57,407 --> 00:02:59,304
Why can't I just have
one of those beeper things

59
00:02:59,308 --> 00:03:00,709
Mom has in case something goes wrong?

60
00:03:00,713 --> 00:03:03,443
- An ELT is not the solution, Jordan.
- You know what?

61
00:03:03,448 --> 00:03:05,580
I thought coming here would be
a chance to start over,

62
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:08,545
but I guess I'm just gonna
be a freak like always.

63
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:14,184
It feels like home already.

64
00:03:14,189 --> 00:03:16,153
I need to talk to Eliza.

65
00:03:25,103 --> 00:03:26,863
I told Jordan that I
would be there for him,

66
00:03:26,868 --> 00:03:30,200
but I don't even know
what he needs right now.

67
00:03:30,205 --> 00:03:32,536
He just needs his dad.

68
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:36,795
You're really swimming around

69
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,830
in that head of yours lately, huh?

70
00:03:38,835 --> 00:03:42,033
That stranger in the war suit
really got to you, didn't he?

71
00:03:42,038 --> 00:03:44,539
He seemed to know a lot about Superman.

72
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:50,141
What if he knows about us,
the boys, where we live?

73
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:53,578
My dad's working on it. He'll find him.

74
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:55,083
And in the meantime,

75
00:03:55,088 --> 00:03:57,588
let's just focus on
what we came here for:

76
00:03:57,593 --> 00:03:59,327
family.

77
00:04:03,006 --> 00:04:05,006
_

78
00:04:23,622 --> 00:04:25,753
Open it, now.

79
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:42,570
_

80
00:04:42,575 --> 00:04:44,372
- Where is it?
- Where is what?

81
00:04:44,377 --> 00:04:46,677
- The Kryptonite!
- Kryptonite?

82
00:04:46,682 --> 00:04:48,909
Where is it?

83
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:51,211
I haven't had any for a long time.

84
00:04:51,216 --> 00:04:53,784
I swear to God. I can't get it anymore!

85
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:03,957
I take it you were unable to secure

86
00:05:03,962 --> 00:05:06,627
the necessary Kryptonite,
Captain Luthor.

87
00:05:06,632 --> 00:05:09,730
- We need to keep looking.
- I understand, Captain,

88
00:05:09,735 --> 00:05:11,632
but your suit's running low on power.

89
00:05:11,637 --> 00:05:14,468
- Then we'll take the ship.
- It's barely operable.

90
00:05:14,473 --> 00:05:15,870
I don't care.

91
00:05:18,667 --> 00:05:19,996
We need to stop Kal-El

92
00:05:20,001 --> 00:05:23,476
before he does to this world
what he did to mine.

93
00:05:30,693 --> 00:05:32,893

94
00:05:34,426 --> 00:05:35,922
You know what?

95
00:05:35,927 --> 00:05:38,458
- I just realized something.
- Yeah?

96
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:40,226
I think this is gonna be the first time

97
00:05:40,231 --> 00:05:41,761
I've ever gone to school without you.

98
00:05:41,766 --> 00:05:44,130
Yeah, it is. It's kind of weird.

99
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:46,399
- No phone today.
- Okay.

100
00:05:46,404 --> 00:05:49,731
Hey, try to keep
an open mind, all right?

101
00:05:49,736 --> 00:05:51,036
- Okay.
- I love you.

102
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:53,271
- Love you too.
- We gotta go.

103
00:05:53,276 --> 00:05:55,207
Bye, babe.

104
00:05:55,212 --> 00:05:57,312
Remember, if anybody asks, he's sick.

105
00:05:58,381 --> 00:06:00,882
Why do we need these big winter jackets?

106
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,854
Are we flying somewhere?

107
00:06:04,859 --> 00:06:08,491
Kind of have to. Hold on, okay?

108
00:06:10,001 --> 00:06:11,598
Whoo!

109
00:06:11,603 --> 00:06:13,159
How come he gets to go flying with Dad

110
00:06:13,163 --> 00:06:15,794
and I have to go to school?

111
00:06:15,799 --> 00:06:17,663
At least we have the radio.

112
00:06:28,617 --> 00:06:32,283
- Hey, you confused already?
- Oh, hey.

113
00:06:32,288 --> 00:06:37,193
Uh, hey, um, yeah, yeah,
actually, I'm a little lost.

114
00:06:37,198 --> 00:06:39,598
- World history, portable three?
- Oh, it's outside.

115
00:06:39,603 --> 00:06:41,100
- I'll show you.
- Okay.

116
00:06:41,105 --> 00:06:43,970
No Jordan today?

117
00:06:43,975 --> 00:06:47,206
Um, he's not feeling so good.

118
00:06:47,211 --> 00:06:48,759
- Oh.
- Whoa.

119
00:06:48,764 --> 00:06:50,897
- Sean...
- Heard you Kent brothers were moving here.

120
00:06:50,902 --> 00:06:52,631
Come on, this is not...

121
00:06:52,636 --> 00:06:55,568
You're supposed to be what?
Some kind of star quarterback?

122
00:06:55,573 --> 00:06:57,736
- I'm all right.
- Too bad.

123
00:06:57,741 --> 00:06:59,938
- We already got a QB.
- How mature.

124
00:06:59,943 --> 00:07:02,040
And we'll see how
you do with our offense.

125
00:07:02,045 --> 00:07:04,242
Some people think it's tough to learn,

126
00:07:04,247 --> 00:07:06,778
especially if you somehow
never got the playbook.

127
00:07:08,419 --> 00:07:09,919
Tell your brother I said hi.

128
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:14,651
It's outside, to the left. Sorry.

129
00:07:14,656 --> 00:07:16,553
Thanks.

130
00:07:23,438 --> 00:07:25,969
Why'd you take us here?

131
00:07:25,974 --> 00:07:29,405
I definitely should have
worn better shoes.

132
00:07:46,054 --> 00:07:47,983
What is this place?

133
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:03,105
After my father died,
I felt pretty lost.

134
00:08:04,137 --> 00:08:06,869
I had a lot of questions
about who I was,

135
00:08:06,874 --> 00:08:08,837
why I could do the things I could do.

136
00:08:08,842 --> 00:08:12,374
So I came here, found my answers.

137
00:08:12,379 --> 00:08:15,781
Maybe this place can help you
the same way it helped me.

138
00:08:18,586 --> 00:08:20,415
That's the thing from the ship.

139
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,020
It's a sunstone crystal.

140
00:08:22,025 --> 00:08:23,522
Think of it as a computer drive

141
00:08:23,527 --> 00:08:26,224
that contains the entire
history of Krypton.

142
00:08:26,229 --> 00:08:28,991
So you brought me to
an igloo in the North Pole

143
00:08:28,996 --> 00:08:30,192
to read about Krypton?

144
00:08:30,197 --> 00:08:32,094
Not "read" exactly.

145
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:34,696
It's more like "experience".

146
00:08:39,372 --> 00:08:41,103
Your family history

147
00:08:41,108 --> 00:08:44,472
begins in Krypton's second-largest city,

148
00:08:44,477 --> 00:08:46,875
Kryptonopolis.

149
00:08:52,685 --> 00:08:56,890
_

150
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:12,065
- Hey, Lois.
- Hey, Lana, Kyle.

151
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:16,270
- How's everyone doing?
- You know, um, adjusting.

152
00:09:16,275 --> 00:09:19,906
Look, if you need anything,
please don't hesitate to call.

153
00:09:19,911 --> 00:09:20,911
You know what?

154
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:22,741
You should all come tomorrow

155
00:09:22,746 --> 00:09:24,343
for a barbecue.

156
00:09:24,348 --> 00:09:26,779
Yeah, it's one less meal to worry about.

157
00:09:26,784 --> 00:09:28,180
Yeah, great.

158
00:09:28,185 --> 00:09:29,883
You're writing something
about Morgan Edge?

159
00:09:29,888 --> 00:09:31,752
He's not as great
as you think he is, Kyle.

160
00:09:31,757 --> 00:09:33,321
Well, he's bringing jobs to Smallville,

161
00:09:33,326 --> 00:09:35,289
so that's good enough for me.

162
00:09:35,294 --> 00:09:36,690
- Kyle.
- Mr. Mayor.

163
00:09:36,695 --> 00:09:38,626
- All set for tonight?
- Yes, sir.

164
00:09:38,631 --> 00:09:40,831
- Big night for us.
- Yeah, we're good to go.

165
00:09:40,836 --> 00:09:41,968
Excuse me.

166
00:09:43,122 --> 00:09:44,122
Big night?

167
00:09:44,127 --> 00:09:47,557
Oh, uh, there's a city
council meeting tonight.

168
00:09:47,562 --> 00:09:50,560
So tomorrow, say 7:00?

169
00:09:50,565 --> 00:09:53,364
Great, yeah. We'll bring bubbles.

170
00:09:53,369 --> 00:09:55,302
Okay, great.

171
00:09:57,382 --> 00:10:00,179
And hope was starting to wane.

172
00:10:00,184 --> 00:10:05,318
The planet's natural resources
were reaching exhaustion.

173
00:10:05,323 --> 00:10:09,089
As the people discovered Krypton's fate,

174
00:10:09,094 --> 00:10:12,325
peace devolved into war,

175
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:16,028
accelerating the planet's ruin.

176
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:20,238
Our home was lost forever.

177
00:10:25,409 --> 00:10:28,140
It's a lot to absorb, I know.

178
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,646
How'd you know to do this
when you came here?

179
00:10:32,823 --> 00:10:34,753
My father showed me.

180
00:10:34,758 --> 00:10:38,590
Well, the AI of my Kryptonian father.

181
00:10:38,595 --> 00:10:42,800
Jordan, this is your grandfather,

182
00:10:42,805 --> 00:10:47,459
the man you're named after, Jor-El.

183
00:10:47,464 --> 00:10:50,664
- You brought your son to me.
- Why?

184
00:10:50,669 --> 00:10:53,634
Because unlike we thought, Father,

185
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:55,639
he's manifesting abilities.

186
00:10:55,644 --> 00:10:57,444
Well, then...

187
00:10:58,608 --> 00:11:01,108
it is possible for us to further

188
00:11:01,113 --> 00:11:04,145
our Kryptonian heritage after all.

189
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:06,945
And you, Jordan,

190
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:09,047
you will be the one to do it.

191
00:11:25,576 --> 00:11:28,612
- Where were you guys all day?
- Go tell him.

192
00:11:30,104 --> 00:11:31,801
What up, big dog?

193
00:11:37,186 --> 00:11:39,618
- How'd it go?
- Come here.

194
00:11:39,623 --> 00:11:40,885
What?

195
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:42,654
Oh, I think I finally broke through.

196
00:11:42,659 --> 00:11:44,222
Oh.

197
00:11:44,227 --> 00:11:46,059
I'm gonna take him back
tomorrow for some tests.

198
00:11:46,063 --> 00:11:47,326
- I told you.
- Yeah.

199
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:48,531
That reminds me.

200
00:11:48,536 --> 00:11:50,501
Lana invited us to dinner
at their place tomorrow night.

201
00:11:50,505 --> 00:11:51,901
So don't stay too late.

202
00:11:51,906 --> 00:11:53,203
You going somewhere?

203
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:55,138
Going to a city council meeting

204
00:11:55,143 --> 00:11:56,773
about the Edge proposal.

205
00:11:56,778 --> 00:12:00,778
Lois, Lois, Lois, we're
just settling in here.

206
00:12:00,783 --> 00:12:03,395
Only for a few minutes...
just to listen.

207
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:08,306
Yeah, he texted while you were gone.

208
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:09,907
Said he was stopping by.

209
00:12:09,912 --> 00:12:12,645
Well, he has his work face on.

210
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:14,213
I'm gonna take the boys with me.

211
00:12:14,218 --> 00:12:15,878
I don't want them hearing
about some crazy person

212
00:12:15,882 --> 00:12:16,945
stalking their dad.

213
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:18,947
So how was today without me?

214
00:12:18,952 --> 00:12:21,947
Uh, you know, it was...
it was a lot better, actually.

215
00:12:21,952 --> 00:12:23,353
I think we should have done
this a long time ago.

216
00:12:23,357 --> 00:12:26,323
- Shut up.
- Boys, you're coming with me.

217
00:12:28,055 --> 00:12:30,088
Behave.

218
00:12:34,156 --> 00:12:36,386
Sources tell us our armored friend here

219
00:12:36,391 --> 00:12:39,494
hit a black market weapons site
last night in Moldova.

220
00:12:39,499 --> 00:12:41,596
- What'd he take?
- Not sure yet.

221
00:12:41,601 --> 00:12:45,200
Blew out the whole operation
before leaving, though.

222
00:12:45,205 --> 00:12:46,869
What'd he say to you, exactly?

223
00:12:46,874 --> 00:12:48,904
Just what he knew about Superman

224
00:12:48,909 --> 00:12:50,773
and that we'd see each other again.

225
00:12:50,778 --> 00:12:54,309
Well, we know how to make that happen.

226
00:12:54,314 --> 00:12:55,811
This time he came in a ship.

227
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:57,613
So he brought more than
just a war suit with him.

228
00:12:57,617 --> 00:12:59,048
He sure did.

229
00:12:59,053 --> 00:13:00,983
My guys were able to assign

230
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:03,652
this thing a residence identifier.

231
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:07,662
Goes airborne again, we got him.

232
00:13:08,728 --> 00:13:10,624
We won't be here long,
so don't make a scene.

233
00:13:10,629 --> 00:13:12,496
No fighting.

234
00:13:21,979 --> 00:13:24,109
Hey, Sarah. Hey.

235
00:13:24,114 --> 00:13:25,510
Hey.

236
00:13:25,515 --> 00:13:27,215
You're too sick to go to school,

237
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,850
but your mom brought you here?

238
00:13:28,855 --> 00:13:30,544
I started feeling a lot better,

239
00:13:30,549 --> 00:13:33,714
- and, you know, so we...
- Mm-hmm.

240
00:13:33,719 --> 00:13:37,484
Jonathan, I'm really sorry
about Timmy and the playbook.

241
00:13:37,489 --> 00:13:39,152
I would have done something if...

242
00:13:39,157 --> 00:13:41,855
It's all good. I got
one now, so it's cool.

243
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,360
Cool.

244
00:13:57,943 --> 00:14:00,741
Can I help you with something?

245
00:14:00,746 --> 00:14:02,876
I saw you at the diner.

246
00:14:02,881 --> 00:14:05,915
Wow, you're Lois Lane.

247
00:14:06,786 --> 00:14:08,449
- And you're...
- Oh, Chrissy Beppo.

248
00:14:08,454 --> 00:14:11,519
I've been wanting to introduce
myself the last few days,

249
00:14:11,524 --> 00:14:13,089
but I totally chickened out.

250
00:14:14,126 --> 00:14:17,157
- A fellow journalist?
- "Smallville Gazette".

251
00:14:17,162 --> 00:14:18,525
I came to cover this,

252
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:20,728
not that there's much news
to ever cover at these things.

253
00:14:20,732 --> 00:14:22,663
Okay, let's... let's
get this thing going

254
00:14:22,668 --> 00:14:26,600
by welcoming my friend
and our mayor, George Dean.

255
00:14:28,373 --> 00:14:29,373
Thank you, Chief.

256
00:14:29,378 --> 00:14:30,708
I would like to thank

257
00:14:30,713 --> 00:14:33,137
all the members of the city council.

258
00:14:33,142 --> 00:14:35,973
Hey, I know you're at "The Daily Planet"

259
00:14:35,978 --> 00:14:38,775
and everything, but if you ever
want to write an article

260
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:40,310
for the "Gazette"
now that you live here,

261
00:14:40,314 --> 00:14:42,411
my editor doesn't shut up about you.

262
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:43,616
You're, like, her idol.

263
00:14:43,621 --> 00:14:47,452
Ladies and gentlemen, Morgan Edge.

264
00:14:51,978 --> 00:14:53,159
Whoo, yeah!

265
00:15:02,406 --> 00:15:04,969
Sure is quiet out here...

266
00:15:04,974 --> 00:15:06,507
simple.

267
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,399
You still looking for the simple life?

268
00:15:12,638 --> 00:15:14,638
'Cause those days are gone, Clark...

269
00:15:15,952 --> 00:15:17,384
long gone.

270
00:15:19,789 --> 00:15:21,187
Let me know when you find the ship.

271
00:15:21,191 --> 00:15:23,257
Why'd you move the family here?

272
00:15:25,009 --> 00:15:27,709
You took Lois away from
where she needs to be,

273
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:31,830
hurt Jonathan's football chances.

274
00:15:31,835 --> 00:15:35,002
Jordan's got no chance
of fitting in with kids here.

275
00:15:36,505 --> 00:15:37,936
Must have had a hell of a reason.

276
00:15:47,725 --> 00:15:49,592
You told the boys you're Superman.

277
00:15:51,186 --> 00:15:53,851
- Couldn't lie to 'em anymore.
- You sure as hell could.

278
00:15:53,856 --> 00:15:54,856
Sam...

279
00:15:54,861 --> 00:15:57,020
You have any idea what you just did?

280
00:15:57,025 --> 00:15:58,856
You ruined their childhood, Clark.

281
00:15:58,861 --> 00:16:02,627
I've seen the toll this life's
taken on Lois over the years.

282
00:16:02,632 --> 00:16:05,166
She never says anything
to you, but I know.

283
00:16:06,435 --> 00:16:09,914
Now you're gonna put the boys
through that same hell?

284
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:11,483
This is gonna keep my family together.

285
00:16:11,488 --> 00:16:15,586
No, Clark, it's gonna tear it apart.

286
00:16:25,535 --> 00:16:28,232
What is it, Rosetti?

287
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:30,434
Mongolia?

288
00:16:33,777 --> 00:16:35,674
How many jobs you looking to provide?

289
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:36,875
Just so they know.

290
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,677
From entry level to tradesman,

291
00:16:38,682 --> 00:16:40,879
we're estimating around 600.

292
00:16:40,884 --> 00:16:43,682
And that's not including
peripheral jobs, folks.

293
00:16:43,687 --> 00:16:46,384
So if there are no more questions...

294
00:16:46,389 --> 00:16:47,988
I have a question.

295
00:16:49,491 --> 00:16:52,756
That jobs number you say is an estimate?

296
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:54,124
That's right, Ms. Lane.

297
00:16:54,129 --> 00:16:55,993
It's difficult to guarantee
an exact figure.

298
00:16:55,998 --> 00:16:58,528
So is there a number
that's more feasible?

299
00:16:58,533 --> 00:17:00,098
Because I would hate for what happened

300
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:02,733
in New Carthage to happen here.

301
00:17:02,738 --> 00:17:03,834
Such as?

302
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:06,837
Missing job-creation targets
by nearly 50%,

303
00:17:06,842 --> 00:17:10,541
paying well below living wage,
that kind of thing.

304
00:17:10,546 --> 00:17:12,011
Here's what I love about Lois Lane...

305
00:17:12,015 --> 00:17:14,178
when she smells a story,

306
00:17:14,183 --> 00:17:16,847
she goes after it
with everything she has,

307
00:17:16,852 --> 00:17:18,348
even if it concerns her own boss.

308
00:17:18,353 --> 00:17:21,951
I thought those mines would be fruitful.

309
00:17:21,956 --> 00:17:23,820
I was wrong.

310
00:17:23,825 --> 00:17:25,555
But what I promised those people

311
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:29,158
was that I'd take a risk on
them when no one else would,

312
00:17:29,163 --> 00:17:31,928
and that's exactly what I've
come to offer everyone here:

313
00:17:31,933 --> 00:17:35,532
a chance to save this town

314
00:17:35,537 --> 00:17:38,134
and improve its residents' lives.

315
00:17:38,139 --> 00:17:40,203
- Yeah.
- Hear, hear.

316
00:17:43,177 --> 00:17:45,275
But perhaps you're right, Ms. Lane.

317
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,144
Perhaps Smallville isn't the place

318
00:17:48,149 --> 00:17:50,714
to take a risk right now.

319
00:17:50,719 --> 00:17:52,449
I certainly wouldn't
want to cause any harm

320
00:17:52,454 --> 00:17:54,750
to this great community.

321
00:17:54,755 --> 00:17:57,353
Maybe that's something you all
need to discuss further.

322
00:17:57,358 --> 00:17:59,855
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for your time.

323
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:01,693
If you'll forgive me.

324
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:10,098
Oh, my God, it's just like
what they say about you.

325
00:18:10,103 --> 00:18:13,469
You don't go the news.
The news goes to you.

326
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:34,758
- Stop!
- _

327
00:18:37,397 --> 00:18:39,430
You tracked my ship.

328
00:18:40,301 --> 00:18:41,530
What do you want?

329
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:44,433
You... gone.

330
00:18:44,438 --> 00:18:47,736
Why? What did I do to you?

331
00:18:47,741 --> 00:18:50,939
It wasn't just me. You
destroyed my whole planet!

332
00:19:27,505 --> 00:19:29,737
I know you can hear the bomb in my ship.

333
00:19:29,742 --> 00:19:32,139
People are gonna get hurt.

334
00:19:32,144 --> 00:19:34,343
Me or them.

335
00:19:35,815 --> 00:19:37,445
Make a choice, Kal-El.

336
00:20:30,506 --> 00:20:31,638
Hike!

337
00:20:34,978 --> 00:20:36,174
Come on!

338
00:20:36,179 --> 00:20:38,109
- Yeah!
- There you go, Ryan!

339
00:20:38,114 --> 00:20:39,444
There you go!

340
00:20:39,449 --> 00:20:41,845
Run it again, but better! Let's go!

341
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:43,681
Can I take some snaps today, Coach?

342
00:20:43,686 --> 00:20:46,817
Kent, I want you on the book
learning the offense.

343
00:20:46,822 --> 00:20:48,186
It doesn't look too complicated.

344
00:20:48,191 --> 00:20:50,088
I think if you just put me out there,

345
00:20:50,093 --> 00:20:52,256
I can show you what I can do.

346
00:20:52,261 --> 00:20:55,193
Hmm.

347
00:20:55,198 --> 00:20:57,495
Ryan, hydrate!

348
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,800
All right, Kent.

349
00:21:00,002 --> 00:21:02,699
Twins right flex, 23 Savior.

350
00:21:04,072 --> 00:21:06,569
Come on, let's go! Pick it up!

351
00:21:06,574 --> 00:21:09,979
Twins right flex, 23 Savior!

352
00:21:10,912 --> 00:21:14,247
Ready... ready!

353
00:21:15,712 --> 00:21:17,275
Come on, now.

354
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,578
That was a simple running play, genius.

355
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:20,713
Again!

356
00:21:20,718 --> 00:21:23,635
Falcon right, 45 Buster!

357
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,239
Falcon right, 45 Buster!

358
00:21:26,244 --> 00:21:28,640
Ready, ready!

359
00:21:34,817 --> 00:21:37,715
Hey, hey, hey!

360
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,949
That's enough! That's enough!

361
00:21:39,953 --> 00:21:42,153
I told you... we already got a QB.

362
00:21:42,158 --> 00:21:43,788
That's enough!

363
00:21:45,195 --> 00:21:47,692
He knew my history, my weaknesses.

364
00:21:47,697 --> 00:21:50,495
- He had Kryptonite.
- He's from another planet?

365
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,998
That's what he said.

366
00:21:53,003 --> 00:21:55,503
He blames me somehow
for it being destroyed.

367
00:21:55,508 --> 00:21:56,809
Well, you'll figure it out, Clark.

368
00:21:56,813 --> 00:21:58,413
You've taken on guys like this before.

369
00:21:58,418 --> 00:21:59,848
This is the worst time

370
00:21:59,853 --> 00:22:01,384
for someone like this to be showing up.

371
00:22:01,388 --> 00:22:03,264
Right when you moved
your family to Smallville

372
00:22:03,269 --> 00:22:05,599
and you promised the boys
you'd be dad of the year?

373
00:22:07,706 --> 00:22:10,707
Your dad knows that we told the boys.

374
00:22:12,077 --> 00:22:13,640
He figured it out the other night.

375
00:22:13,645 --> 00:22:14,875
What'd he say?

376
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,376
Oh, you know, just that we're making

377
00:22:16,381 --> 00:22:17,878
the biggest mistake of our lives.

378
00:22:17,883 --> 00:22:19,783
See, now I know
we're on the right track.

379
00:22:21,954 --> 00:22:23,152
What's that?

380
00:22:24,656 --> 00:22:26,553
It is about an article I am working on

381
00:22:26,558 --> 00:22:29,239
about Morgan Edge.

382
00:22:29,244 --> 00:22:30,244
Edge?

383
00:22:30,249 --> 00:22:33,494
He was at the Smallville city
council meeting last night.

384
00:22:33,499 --> 00:22:35,428
I thought you weren't getting involved.

385
00:22:35,433 --> 00:22:38,418
Well, yes, but then
he started spouting this BS

386
00:22:38,423 --> 00:22:39,666
about helping the town.

387
00:22:39,671 --> 00:22:43,236
Morgan Edge is not here
to save Smallville, Kansas.

388
00:22:43,241 --> 00:22:46,573
He's here for cheap labor
because people are desperate,

389
00:22:46,578 --> 00:22:48,141
just like he did with New Carthage

390
00:22:48,146 --> 00:22:49,742
and Hazel Green and Granville.

391
00:22:49,747 --> 00:22:52,982
He is eating these small towns
from the inside out.

392
00:22:54,497 --> 00:22:56,361
Thank you.

393
00:22:56,366 --> 00:22:58,596
"Morgan Edge is a corporate vampire".

394
00:22:58,601 --> 00:23:01,866
You remember that Edge
owns the "Planet"?

395
00:23:01,871 --> 00:23:03,071
So?

396
00:23:03,076 --> 00:23:05,024
So he's not gonna let you publish this.

397
00:23:05,029 --> 00:23:06,126
You know what, babe?

398
00:23:06,131 --> 00:23:07,527
You do your Superman stuff,

399
00:23:07,532 --> 00:23:10,233
and I will do my Lois Lane stuff.

400
00:23:12,903 --> 00:23:14,334
I'm serious, Clark.

401
00:23:14,339 --> 00:23:17,874
I'm getting this gut feeling
that this is one of the reasons

402
00:23:17,879 --> 00:23:19,672
I was supposed to come to Smallville.

403
00:23:19,677 --> 00:23:23,308
I am not going to let
Morgan Edge destroy this town

404
00:23:23,313 --> 00:23:24,847
like he did the others.

405
00:23:26,216 --> 00:23:27,879
Dad's taking me to the Fortress today,

406
00:23:27,884 --> 00:23:28,914
gonna run some tests,

407
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:31,117
see what powers I have
or will have or whatever.

408
00:23:31,122 --> 00:23:34,923
- Can you imagine if I can fly?
- No, not really.

409
00:23:38,158 --> 00:23:40,223
What Sarah said about
the playbook, what happened?

410
00:23:40,228 --> 00:23:41,860
I mean, I didn't get it,

411
00:23:41,865 --> 00:23:45,096
and now I have it, so it's cool.

412
00:23:45,101 --> 00:23:47,533
- All right.
- Ready?

413
00:23:47,538 --> 00:23:50,669
- Yeah.
- See you guys later.

414
00:23:50,674 --> 00:23:53,708
Have fun being Superman
and Superboy or whatever.

415
00:24:01,602 --> 00:24:03,599
What's wrong?

416
00:24:03,604 --> 00:24:04,804
Nothing, Mom.

417
00:24:04,809 --> 00:24:07,809
I just need to... I just need
to learn this playbook.

418
00:24:10,394 --> 00:24:12,692
Jonathan...

419
00:24:12,697 --> 00:24:15,461
you're a really great brother,
you know that?

420
00:24:15,466 --> 00:24:19,565
I know how much you gave up
by saying yes to coming here.

421
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:21,270
Your whole life's in Metropolis.

422
00:24:21,275 --> 00:24:22,806
Your girlfriend's there.

423
00:24:22,811 --> 00:24:26,437
Your entire identity is there,

424
00:24:26,442 --> 00:24:28,372
but you said yes to coming here anyway

425
00:24:28,377 --> 00:24:30,611
'cause you wanted to help your brother.

426
00:24:32,581 --> 00:24:34,981
You and I both had lives we left behind.

427
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:37,987
Yeah.

428
00:24:47,478 --> 00:24:50,543
And you're certain
he's displayed abilities?

429
00:24:50,548 --> 00:24:52,078
- Absolutely, sir.
- Why?

430
00:24:52,083 --> 00:24:55,882
The photo-nucleic effect
appears to be insignificant.

431
00:24:55,887 --> 00:24:57,884
Insignificant?

432
00:24:57,889 --> 00:24:58,952
How can that be?

433
00:24:58,957 --> 00:25:01,353
His cells can only store

434
00:25:01,358 --> 00:25:04,723
minimum amounts of energy from the Sun.

435
00:25:04,728 --> 00:25:06,528
But he's released an ocular blast.

436
00:25:06,533 --> 00:25:08,830
Only once, and he's since then

437
00:25:08,835 --> 00:25:10,465
been unable to repeat it.

438
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:12,100
He has elevated strength.

439
00:25:12,105 --> 00:25:14,869
For his size, perhaps,
but nothing extraordinary.

440
00:25:14,874 --> 00:25:17,386
He doesn't even have
1/100 your strength.

441
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:20,156
- Let's test him again.
- There is no reason to do so.

442
00:25:20,161 --> 00:25:21,824
These have been random occurrences.

443
00:25:21,829 --> 00:25:23,392
He'll never have enough power

444
00:25:23,397 --> 00:25:25,795
to produce these abilities on command.

445
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:29,260
His human DNA is just too limiting.

446
00:25:30,317 --> 00:25:32,815
I know you wished for this,

447
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:36,852
but he will never be like you, Kal-El.

448
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:48,010
Jordan...

449
00:25:55,104 --> 00:25:56,700
Sam, I sent this in hours ago,

450
00:25:56,705 --> 00:26:00,161
and now you're having
second th... hello?

451
00:26:00,166 --> 00:26:02,063
- Leave me alone.
- Jordan.

452
00:26:02,068 --> 00:26:04,699
I'm not going to the Cushings'.

453
00:26:04,704 --> 00:26:06,104
What happened at the Fortress?

454
00:26:06,109 --> 00:26:07,310
I guess we found out what I always knew.

455
00:26:07,314 --> 00:26:09,394
- I'm not special.
- Jordan, it is a process.

456
00:26:09,399 --> 00:26:11,069
We will go back, we will test you again,

457
00:26:11,074 --> 00:26:12,774
and we'll see how you
progress over time.

458
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:14,644
- Yeah.
- Maybe he should just stay home.

459
00:26:14,649 --> 00:26:17,228
What? Why?

460
00:26:17,233 --> 00:26:19,463
- Baby have another bad day?
- Screw you.

461
00:26:19,468 --> 00:26:20,468
- No!
- Boys...

462
00:26:20,473 --> 00:26:22,952
No, I am sick of your crap,
okay, Jordan?

463
00:26:22,957 --> 00:26:25,869
This is not just about you!
I got the shaft.

464
00:26:25,874 --> 00:26:27,145
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what does that mean?

465
00:26:27,149 --> 00:26:29,733
It means that Don Draper
over here kissed Sarah

466
00:26:29,738 --> 00:26:32,938
at the bonfire party,
so now her dick boyfriend

467
00:26:32,943 --> 00:26:34,940
and the entire team are out to get me!

468
00:26:34,945 --> 00:26:37,185
- That's why you didn't get the playbook?
- Yeah, genius.

469
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:39,777
I guess super perception
isn't one of your powers.

470
00:26:39,781 --> 00:26:41,212
Okay, okay, you know what, Jonathan?

471
00:26:41,216 --> 00:26:42,847
You and I, we can go out front.
We can run plays.

472
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,180
No, babe, not right now.

473
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:46,483
Listen, sweetie, I am
sorry about the playbook.

474
00:26:46,488 --> 00:26:48,252
That really sucks.

475
00:26:48,257 --> 00:26:49,753
And I'm sorry going to the Fortress

476
00:26:49,758 --> 00:26:51,054
didn't meet your expectations.

477
00:26:51,059 --> 00:26:52,789
You're probably so disappointed,

478
00:26:52,794 --> 00:26:54,457
but now's not the time to wallow

479
00:26:54,462 --> 00:26:57,292
in everything that's gone
wrong since we came here.

480
00:26:57,297 --> 00:26:59,896
We moved here to be closer as a family,

481
00:26:59,901 --> 00:27:01,720
and we got invited
to this dinner as a family,

482
00:27:01,725 --> 00:27:06,268
and we are going as a family,
so get dressed.

483
00:27:09,176 --> 00:27:10,305
You heard your mother.

484
00:27:17,084 --> 00:27:18,714
You made it.

485
00:27:18,719 --> 00:27:20,015
Sorry we're late.

486
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:22,517
I am so glad that you guys could come.

487
00:27:22,522 --> 00:27:24,253
I'm embarrassed... hi.

488
00:27:24,258 --> 00:27:27,256
I'm embarrassed I didn't
have you over sooner.

489
00:27:27,261 --> 00:27:29,091
Oh, yeah, no, don't be.

490
00:27:31,798 --> 00:27:34,430
Oh, that.

491
00:27:34,435 --> 00:27:36,999
Barbecues have become a bit
of a tradition around here.

492
00:27:37,004 --> 00:27:39,401
Everybody loves Kyle's grilling.

493
00:27:39,406 --> 00:27:41,671
Please make yourselves at home.

494
00:27:41,676 --> 00:27:44,273
There is plenty of food.

495
00:27:46,613 --> 00:27:49,078
Hey, I'm gonna come find you in a bit.

496
00:27:49,083 --> 00:27:51,613
- I wanna hear about practice.
- Okay.

497
00:27:58,124 --> 00:27:59,620
One hour?

498
00:27:59,625 --> 00:28:01,155
Tops?

499
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:05,530
You're cheating. You can't...

500
00:28:08,598 --> 00:28:11,098
- Hey.
- Hey.

501
00:28:12,677 --> 00:28:15,711
That's good, Soph. Thank you.

502
00:28:17,148 --> 00:28:18,811
Heard you had another tough one today.

503
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:21,114
Wow, you hear about everything, huh?

504
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:23,315
Sean was over earlier, and he told me.

505
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,585
If you don't mind me asking,
what... what is it exactly

506
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:26,853
that you see in that guy?

507
00:28:26,858 --> 00:28:28,354
He can be really sweet.

508
00:28:28,359 --> 00:28:32,358
Yeah, real sweet guy,

509
00:28:32,363 --> 00:28:33,658
especially on the football field.

510
00:28:33,662 --> 00:28:36,595
Okay, well, all that kissing stuff

511
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,531
is gonna die down pretty soon, so...

512
00:28:38,536 --> 00:28:40,232
He should be mad at me, not Jon.

513
00:28:40,237 --> 00:28:41,770
I'm the one who did it.

514
00:28:44,308 --> 00:28:46,505
You gonna come to school anytime soon?

515
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:48,040
If my parents ever let me.

516
00:28:48,045 --> 00:28:49,941
Why wouldn't they let you go to school?

517
00:28:49,946 --> 00:28:54,151
They don't think I have
control over my issues.

518
00:28:55,286 --> 00:28:58,453
I thought we had it all
figured out, but I guess not.

519
00:29:02,326 --> 00:29:04,455
This little guy right there.

520
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:06,728
There you go, bud. Enjoy.

521
00:29:09,866 --> 00:29:11,163
You come to the wrong place

522
00:29:11,168 --> 00:29:13,168
if you're looking for a tofu burger.

523
00:29:13,173 --> 00:29:15,673
I was waiting for a full rack, actually.

524
00:29:17,774 --> 00:29:20,773
You know, I looked into what
happened in New Carthage.

525
00:29:20,778 --> 00:29:22,608
It wasn't a good deal.

526
00:29:22,613 --> 00:29:25,074
You know, those people wanted
to unionize right off the bat.

527
00:29:25,079 --> 00:29:27,579
Yeah, to protect themselves.

528
00:29:27,584 --> 00:29:28,716
Well, yeah, but that would have meant

529
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,083
that Edge couldn't turn a profit.

530
00:29:30,088 --> 00:29:32,295
He'd have lost a third of his workforce

531
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:33,685
if those salaries went up.

532
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:35,188
I'm sorry... are you trying to argue

533
00:29:35,192 --> 00:29:37,021
that people shouldn't
make a living wage?

534
00:29:37,026 --> 00:29:38,756
No, okay, what I'm saying

535
00:29:38,761 --> 00:29:40,790
is that in situations like this,

536
00:29:40,795 --> 00:29:42,830
some money in your pocket
is better than none.

537
00:29:43,966 --> 00:29:46,330
A lot of nothing is
still nothing, Ms. Lane.

538
00:29:46,335 --> 00:29:48,966
Short-term sacrifices
for long-term gain.

539
00:29:48,971 --> 00:29:51,535
This is something
to get the ball rolling.

540
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,941
It's what Smallville needs right now.

541
00:29:56,206 --> 00:29:57,939
Enjoy your ribs.

542
00:30:06,222 --> 00:30:08,652
He changed it. He changed my story.

543
00:30:08,657 --> 00:30:10,184
It's, like, a pro-Edge fluff piece.

544
00:30:10,189 --> 00:30:12,789
- Foswell did this?
- No, Edge.

545
00:30:12,794 --> 00:30:14,758
I can't let him do this.

546
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,633
General, you need to see this.

547
00:30:22,137 --> 00:30:23,867
He's here.

548
00:30:36,117 --> 00:30:38,214
Now? You gotta be kidding me.

549
00:30:38,219 --> 00:30:40,350
It's your dad. He's at the DOD.

550
00:30:45,126 --> 00:30:46,923
I'll explain why. Go.

551
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:55,398
Light him up.

552
00:30:55,403 --> 00:30:57,533
- You are green.
- Fire!

553
00:31:13,338 --> 00:31:16,343
_

554
00:31:17,675 --> 00:31:20,107
- Get a signal on that suit, Rosetti.
- _

555
00:31:20,112 --> 00:31:21,308
I'm trying.

556
00:31:23,115 --> 00:31:24,915
Where the hell is Superman?

557
00:31:39,563 --> 00:31:42,194
Go, go, go, everyone out!

558
00:31:42,199 --> 00:31:44,199
- You heard the general!
- Move it!

559
00:31:44,204 --> 00:31:46,404
Go! Go!

560
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,337
What the hell?

561
00:31:51,342 --> 00:31:54,844
- Get the power back up, Rosetti.
- On it, sir.

562
00:31:58,916 --> 00:32:01,414
You have to stop protecting him.

563
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:04,983
- Superman?
- Stop calling him that!

564
00:32:04,988 --> 00:32:07,488
He's not one of us, Sam.

565
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:11,289
Where I come from, you're like me,

566
00:32:11,294 --> 00:32:13,294
and you don't trust him either

567
00:32:13,299 --> 00:32:15,326
because you know what is capable of.

568
00:32:15,331 --> 00:32:18,530
You have to help me
save your planet, Sam,

569
00:32:18,535 --> 00:32:20,032
before Kal-El...

570
00:33:09,183 --> 00:33:11,250
To hell and back, General.

571
00:33:33,474 --> 00:33:35,005
So?

572
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:38,074
- Did you get the stranger?
- Getting closer.

573
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:39,709
How was the rest of the barbecue?

574
00:33:39,714 --> 00:33:41,210
We didn't stay very long.

575
00:33:41,215 --> 00:33:42,912
The ribs were really good, though.

576
00:33:42,917 --> 00:33:44,315
Yeah?

577
00:33:45,318 --> 00:33:47,046
You know how many times,
as a kid, I'd sit out here,

578
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:49,117
and my mom and dad would come out,

579
00:33:49,122 --> 00:33:51,716
and I'd ask them a thousand questions

580
00:33:51,721 --> 00:33:55,761
about how to solve this problem
or that problem?

581
00:33:57,898 --> 00:34:00,331
Do you think we made
a mistake by moving here?

582
00:34:03,203 --> 00:34:04,633
Actually, I don't.

583
00:34:04,638 --> 00:34:07,435
We just have a lot
of questions to answer...

584
00:34:09,509 --> 00:34:12,509
Like what are you gonna do
about "The Planet"?

585
00:34:13,471 --> 00:34:14,637
I don't know.

586
00:34:15,916 --> 00:34:18,846
I've never been rewritten before.

587
00:34:18,851 --> 00:34:20,848
Well, here's what I know.

588
00:34:20,853 --> 00:34:24,919
The fire I saw in you with that story,

589
00:34:24,924 --> 00:34:28,990
I haven't seen that look
in your eye in a long time...

590
00:34:28,995 --> 00:34:31,325
and I know this family
is closer this week

591
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:32,827
than we were last week,

592
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:36,097
so it's okay if we've got
a lot of questions.

593
00:34:36,102 --> 00:34:37,832
We're gonna find the answers together.

594
00:34:45,808 --> 00:34:47,805
Up, up, and away.

595
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:54,110
All right, I'll talk to you tomorrow.

596
00:34:54,115 --> 00:34:56,115
Okay. Good night.

597
00:34:59,953 --> 00:35:01,817
How's Eliza doing?

598
00:35:01,822 --> 00:35:05,154
Hey. Um... she's okay.

599
00:35:05,159 --> 00:35:06,822
She's okay, maybe... maybe too okay.

600
00:35:06,827 --> 00:35:08,527
I don't know.

601
00:35:10,001 --> 00:35:12,902
Look, Jon, I...

602
00:35:15,457 --> 00:35:17,354
You were right before.

603
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:20,059
We moved here for me,
and I never even thanked you.

604
00:35:21,029 --> 00:35:23,594
- You don't have to thank me.
- Yes, I do.

605
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:25,988
Our whole lives,
you've been there for me,

606
00:35:25,993 --> 00:35:29,061
and the least I could do
is be there for you.

607
00:35:32,506 --> 00:35:33,737
Did you ever find out

608
00:35:33,742 --> 00:35:35,304
if you're half-Kryptonian or what?

609
00:35:35,309 --> 00:35:37,206
Not according to Hologramps.

610
00:35:37,211 --> 00:35:38,675
He said I'll never be like Dad.

611
00:35:41,783 --> 00:35:45,048
Jordan, look,

612
00:35:45,053 --> 00:35:47,316
I know what happened in the barn.

613
00:35:47,321 --> 00:35:51,002
Some poles fell on us,
and you saved our lives.

614
00:35:51,007 --> 00:35:52,504
So honestly, I really...

615
00:35:52,509 --> 00:35:55,006
I don't care what some
stupid hologram said.

616
00:35:55,011 --> 00:35:57,190
You're my twin brother.
I know you better than anyone.

617
00:35:57,195 --> 00:35:59,195
You're different now, okay?

618
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,730
Something happened to you,

619
00:36:00,735 --> 00:36:03,265
definitely something special,

620
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:05,300
and if no one else is gonna help you

621
00:36:05,305 --> 00:36:06,870
figure out what that is...

622
00:36:08,175 --> 00:36:09,437
I will.

623
00:36:15,315 --> 00:36:17,746
No, it's, like, that popcorn ceiling.

624
00:36:17,751 --> 00:36:20,916
- It's so old.
- I know it's old.

625
00:36:20,921 --> 00:36:22,520
Take a seat.

626
00:36:23,934 --> 00:36:26,065
What's going on?

627
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:27,235
Take a seat.

628
00:36:34,444 --> 00:36:38,375
- I'm sorry I left last night.
- It's okay.

629
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:40,645
We get you're out saving
the world or whatever.

630
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:42,945
- We're used to it.
- Yeah, I... I know, I know.

631
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:44,480
That's...

632
00:36:44,485 --> 00:36:45,848
That's the problem.

633
00:36:45,853 --> 00:36:49,143
Look, the fact that I'm Superman

634
00:36:49,148 --> 00:36:52,980
means that I've been gone
a lot in your lives.

635
00:36:52,985 --> 00:36:55,942
Now, I always told myself
that you'd both be fine

636
00:36:55,947 --> 00:36:59,063
and that it wouldn't
affect you, but I was wrong.

637
00:36:59,068 --> 00:37:00,464
I know it has.

638
00:37:00,469 --> 00:37:03,910
Now, I can't just abandon the world,

639
00:37:03,915 --> 00:37:07,404
but I can't abandon you two either.

640
00:37:07,409 --> 00:37:09,218
It's gonna take me
some time to figure out

641
00:37:09,223 --> 00:37:13,228
how to be better at both,
but I will, okay?

642
00:37:14,282 --> 00:37:15,311
Okay.

643
00:37:24,826 --> 00:37:26,589
I thought you said this
wouldn't fix my problem.

644
00:37:26,593 --> 00:37:30,193
It won't, but keeping
you home won't either.

645
00:37:30,198 --> 00:37:31,728
So I can go to school?

646
00:37:31,733 --> 00:37:35,738
We have to keep an eye
on your powers, Jordan, but...

647
00:37:36,938 --> 00:37:38,869
yes, you can go.

648
00:37:38,874 --> 00:37:42,075
All right, let's get dressed.
We gotta go.

649
00:37:43,378 --> 00:37:45,808
Wait, where's Mom?

650
00:37:45,813 --> 00:37:48,343
Oh, she, uh... she had a thing.

651
00:37:56,757 --> 00:37:59,621
Lane, I didn't know.

652
00:37:59,626 --> 00:38:01,090
Let me make this very clear.

653
00:38:01,095 --> 00:38:02,792
Either the website gets more clicks,

654
00:38:02,797 --> 00:38:05,430
or various people
sitting in this room will...

655
00:38:08,132 --> 00:38:09,832
You rewrote my story.

656
00:38:11,471 --> 00:38:14,771
I merely corrected what was wrong.

657
00:38:14,776 --> 00:38:17,334
So just to confirm, we can't
do any actual reporting here

658
00:38:17,339 --> 00:38:18,439
anymore, correct?

659
00:38:18,444 --> 00:38:19,774
Ms. Lane, I won't have my paper

660
00:38:19,779 --> 00:38:21,375
printing this kind of nonsense.

661
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:23,381
That's what I thought.

662
00:38:26,385 --> 00:38:28,183
What's this?

663
00:38:28,188 --> 00:38:30,151
That is the best writing

664
00:38:30,156 --> 00:38:32,721
I have done since you took over.

665
00:38:32,726 --> 00:38:35,023
- He's going to crush you.
- Let him try.

666
00:38:43,837 --> 00:38:47,568
What can you say about
leaving a place you loved?

667
00:38:58,584 --> 00:39:01,549
You hope it made you who you are...

668
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:10,352
Challenged your beliefs...

669
00:39:10,357 --> 00:39:14,562
_

670
00:39:18,604 --> 00:39:20,901
Pushed you out of your comfort zone...

671
00:39:30,348 --> 00:39:32,912
And gave you the strength
to demand better...

672
00:39:32,917 --> 00:39:37,122
_

673
00:39:39,424 --> 00:39:41,854
So you're prepared for what's to come.

674
00:39:51,329 --> 00:39:53,326
Hello?

675
00:39:53,331 --> 00:39:55,364
Anyone here?

676
00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:03,342
Sorry.

677
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:08,938
Lois, hi. Can I help you?

678
00:40:08,943 --> 00:40:10,606
I'm guessing you read my article

679
00:40:10,611 --> 00:40:12,509
that was in "The Daily Planet"?

680
00:40:12,514 --> 00:40:14,444
Yeah, I did.

681
00:40:14,449 --> 00:40:16,649
Didn't really read like you.

682
00:40:18,027 --> 00:40:21,693
Because it wasn't.
This is what I really wrote.

683
00:40:21,698 --> 00:40:24,595
Morgan Edge changed the whole piece.

684
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:28,100
You said that your editor
would be interested

685
00:40:28,105 --> 00:40:30,002
in publishing anything I wrote.

686
00:40:30,007 --> 00:40:32,904
You're really good. You got me.

687
00:40:32,909 --> 00:40:34,906
Um, I'm the editor,

688
00:40:34,911 --> 00:40:38,291
reporter, printer, janitor,
sometimes plumber.

689
00:40:38,296 --> 00:40:39,612
Yeah, I don't know why I said that.

690
00:40:39,616 --> 00:40:42,247
- I guess I...
- So are you interested?

691
00:40:42,252 --> 00:40:43,949
Okay, if I publish this,

692
00:40:43,954 --> 00:40:46,284
you'll probably get fired,
and I can't be responsible...

693
00:40:46,289 --> 00:40:49,090
Oh, no, I already quit.

694
00:40:51,729 --> 00:40:53,158
When can you start?

695
00:40:56,299 --> 00:40:59,199
It seems, sir, that you're
going to have to proceed

696
00:40:59,204 --> 00:41:02,036
without the Kryptonite or your ship.

697
00:41:02,041 --> 00:41:03,436
Then I need a new suit.

698
00:41:03,441 --> 00:41:05,039
It will take some time

699
00:41:05,044 --> 00:41:07,675
to locate the proper
materials to build one.

700
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,175
Guess we'll go find what we need.

701
00:41:09,179 --> 00:41:10,479
We have some time.

702
00:41:10,484 --> 00:41:13,411
It seems this planet's
Kal-El is not entirely

703
00:41:13,416 --> 00:41:16,248
like the one you've
encountered, Captain Luthor.

704
00:41:20,023 --> 00:41:23,358
This is Hellfire 3-1
engaging hostile air mobile!

705
00:41:36,706 --> 00:41:39,103
General.

706
00:41:39,108 --> 00:41:40,705
To hell and back.

707
00:41:46,905 --> 00:41:49,470
No, he isn't like my Kal-El...

708
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,364
not yet.

709
00:41:57,903 --> 00:41:59,498
There's no reason to hide it.

710
00:41:59,502 --> 00:42:01,502
Now that you both know he's Superman.

711
00:42:01,506 --> 00:42:03,906
There's nothing I want more
than for you guys to be happy.

712
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:06,310
You lose your job, bring us here.

713
00:42:06,314 --> 00:42:08,064
We've been here for less than a week,

714
00:42:08,068 --> 00:42:09,768
and somebody already
tried to blow up my car.

715
00:42:09,772 --> 00:42:11,896
I wish you'd go back to
not being around anymore.
