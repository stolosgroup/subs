00:00:00,963 --> 00:00:02,882
Previously
On "Superman & Lois"...

2
00:00:02,907 --> 00:00:04,968
Let just focus on what we came
here for: family.

3
00:00:04,993 --> 00:00:06,937
- I don't wanna be
just friends anymore.

4
00:00:06,962 --> 00:00:08,459
- Look around here.
That's your doing!

5
00:00:08,484 --> 00:00:09,574
- People are angry.

6
00:00:09,618 --> 00:00:11,351
- You destroyed everything
I had built.

7
00:00:11,376 --> 00:00:12,900
I will make you suffer.

8
00:00:12,925 --> 00:00:13,962
Not even Superman

9
00:00:13,994 --> 00:00:15,437
is strong enough
to resist Zod.

10
00:00:15,462 --> 00:00:16,765
- Fight back, damn it!

11
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:20,672
- We got him.

12
00:00:20,716 --> 00:00:23,156
- I'm very glad you're better,
Clark. I won't doubt you again.

13
00:00:23,181 --> 00:00:25,132
- Leslie Larr
is still in the wind.

14
00:00:25,157 --> 00:00:26,722
- She'll be in custody
by the end of the week.

15
00:00:26,765 --> 00:00:28,539
- Morgan Edge is in the state-
of-the-art military prison.

16
00:00:28,564 --> 00:00:31,031
- Complete what
you were sent there for.

18
00:00:44,131 --> 00:00:45,828
- Stop.

19
00:00:47,221 --> 00:00:48,961
Stop!

20
00:00:51,069 --> 00:00:53,158
I'm sorry, Father,

21
00:00:53,183 --> 00:00:54,547
I must rest.

22
00:00:54,572 --> 00:00:55,533
- Rest?

23
00:00:55,558 --> 00:00:58,082
This is nothing compared
to what you will endure.

24
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,782
Nothing!

25
00:00:59,807 --> 00:01:02,323
I feel I made a mistake
sending you, Tal.

26
00:01:02,366 --> 00:01:04,325
You are no savior.

27
00:01:04,368 --> 00:01:05,674
- I will be.
- When?

28
00:01:05,717 --> 00:01:07,937
We've been at this for months,

29
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:09,939
and yet you still falter.

30
00:01:09,982 --> 00:01:11,984
- Father, please.

31
00:01:13,334 --> 00:01:15,249
I am the one.

32
00:01:15,292 --> 00:01:17,294
I will become
who I was chosen to be.

33
00:01:17,338 --> 00:01:18,600
- Then prove it.

34
00:01:18,643 --> 00:01:20,080
Prove to me that you will never

35
00:01:20,123 --> 00:01:23,779
shame the house of Rho again.

36
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,398
- What happened
to the Eradicator?

37
00:01:35,269 --> 00:01:37,097
You had it right
before the blast.

38
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,359
What did you do with it?

39
00:01:45,409 --> 00:01:48,064
- Where is it?

40
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:50,284
Tal!

41
00:01:52,895 --> 00:01:56,072
Where is Leslie Larr?
- How could I know?

42
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:59,467
I can't see beyond
these lead-lined walls...

43
00:02:01,251 --> 00:02:03,166
And all I hear

44
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:05,299
is what's in my mind.

45
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:08,040
- There may still
be time for her.

46
00:02:08,084 --> 00:02:09,216
- It's too late.

47
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:11,348
Leslie Larr
replaced Irma Sayres

48
00:02:11,392 --> 00:02:12,958
a long time ago.

49
00:02:13,002 --> 00:02:15,309
- And you feel nothing
for what you've done?

50
00:02:15,352 --> 00:02:18,442
- I feel more than
you could possibly imagine.

51
00:02:18,486 --> 00:02:21,097
But my concern isn't
for the souls

52
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,577
of this planet.

53
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:26,276
It's for those that
need to be resurrected,

54
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,975
my own, even your soul, Kal.

55
00:02:30,976 --> 00:02:32,326
How wrong I was.

56
00:02:32,369 --> 00:02:35,633
- You were,

57
00:02:35,677 --> 00:02:37,679
and so was your father.

58
00:02:37,722 --> 00:02:40,203
We found this at your fortress.

59
00:02:40,247 --> 00:02:41,770
- Go ahead.

60
00:02:41,813 --> 00:02:45,165
Rid me of my father's influence
as I rid you of yours.

61
00:02:48,733 --> 00:02:50,735
- This crystal
will never be used again.

62
00:02:50,779 --> 00:02:53,912
You don't wanna tell me
where Larr is, fine.

63
00:02:53,956 --> 00:02:56,437
I'll find her
and bring her here.

64
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,439
After that,

65
00:02:58,482 --> 00:03:00,745
you and I will never
see each other again.

66
00:03:11,669 --> 00:03:13,497
I spoke with your grandfather.

67
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:14,803
The DOD's gonna stick
around town

68
00:03:14,846 --> 00:03:16,457
a little longer
than they planned.

69
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,372
- Until you guys
find Leslie Larr or...

70
00:03:18,415 --> 00:03:20,243
- That and they're
shutting down the mines.

71
00:03:20,287 --> 00:03:21,331
- Why?

72
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:22,680
- Gonna get all
the X-Kryptonite out

73
00:03:22,724 --> 00:03:24,116
so no one else gets hurt.

74
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,640
- So no one else gets powers,
you mean.

75
00:03:25,683 --> 00:03:27,903
- Also true.
- And then what?

76
00:03:27,946 --> 00:03:29,470
And then we're just supposed
to go back to school

77
00:03:29,513 --> 00:03:31,167
and pretend like none of this
ever happened?

78
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,255
- Principal Balcomb's holding

79
00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:33,387
an all-school assembly today.

80
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,127
She'll talk to everyone
about it,

81
00:03:35,171 --> 00:03:36,520
answer any questions she can.

82
00:03:36,564 --> 00:03:38,043
- Maybe we should
just stay home.

83
00:03:38,087 --> 00:03:39,958
-  Yeah, nice try.

84
00:03:40,002 --> 00:03:41,873
- As far as everyone
is concerned,

85
00:03:41,917 --> 00:03:43,440
Edge was experimenting
with people,

86
00:03:43,484 --> 00:03:45,529
giving them powers,
mind control.

87
00:03:45,573 --> 00:03:47,009
I discovered what he was up to

88
00:03:47,052 --> 00:03:48,706
with the help
of your grandfather

89
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,360
who had help from Superman,

90
00:03:50,404 --> 00:03:52,536
we stopped him, copy?
- Yeah, don't worry, Mom.

91
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:54,669
We're getting pretty good
at cover stories so--

92
00:03:54,712 --> 00:03:56,323
- You ready?

93
00:03:56,366 --> 00:03:57,802
We gotta go.

94
00:03:57,846 --> 00:03:58,977
- Love you guys.

95
00:03:59,021 --> 00:04:00,370
both: Love you.

96
00:04:00,414 --> 00:04:01,676
- Chrissy keeps texting,

97
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:03,634
wondering when I'm coming in.
I gotta go.

98
00:04:03,678 --> 00:04:06,028
- You want a to-go plate?

99
00:04:06,071 --> 00:04:09,205
Our guest is probably hungry.

100
00:04:12,687 --> 00:04:14,602
- I understand
your frustration.

101
00:04:14,645 --> 00:04:16,517
I just ask for your patience.

102
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,521
- And you're recommending Kyle
take a leave from the station?

103
00:04:20,564 --> 00:04:23,263
- Just until all this
Edge stuff blows over,

104
00:04:23,306 --> 00:04:26,614
a couple of weeks, tops.
- A couple of weeks?

105
00:04:26,657 --> 00:04:28,659
Come on, Mayor, I just want
to get back to work.

106
00:04:28,703 --> 00:04:31,314
- Kyle, maybe he's right.

107
00:04:31,358 --> 00:04:32,707
- Well, you know,
I'm not the only one

108
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,491
who wanted Edge coming here.

109
00:04:34,535 --> 00:04:37,233
- And I've been saying
the same thing, Kyle, trust me.

110
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:40,367
I'm not quite sure why people
have been singling you out,

111
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:42,934
but I am gonna change
the narrative,

112
00:04:42,978 --> 00:04:46,329
make sure that they put
the blame where it should be.

113
00:04:46,373 --> 00:04:48,418
Just give me some time.

114
00:04:50,507 --> 00:04:52,117
- Attention.
Attention.

115
00:04:52,161 --> 00:04:54,468
All students
are now required...

116
00:04:54,511 --> 00:04:55,817
- Today's gonna suck.

117
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,993
- It feels like the Salem
witch trials are here.

118
00:04:58,036 --> 00:05:00,430
- Hey, Sarah.
- Where's everybody going?

119
00:05:00,474 --> 00:05:02,998
- School assembly about Edge.

120
00:05:06,784 --> 00:05:08,917
- I can't do this today.

121
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,747
- Where are you going?
- Anywhere but here.

122
00:05:16,533 --> 00:05:19,275
- Yo, Kent!
- Yo, what's good, boys?

123
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:23,235
- Dude, is it true?
Your grandpa runs the DOD?

124
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:25,586
- Uh, yes.

125
00:05:25,629 --> 00:05:27,283
Yeah, something like that.
Yeah.

126
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,154
- Sounds like some "Get Out"
level stuff went down.

127
00:05:29,198 --> 00:05:30,982
- Come on, man.
How'd Edge do it?

128
00:05:31,026 --> 00:05:33,550
- Okay, gentlemen,
head to the gym.

129
00:05:33,594 --> 00:05:35,726
Let's get a move on.
Let's go.

130
00:05:36,466 --> 00:05:38,947
You too, Mr. Kent.
- Yes, ma'am.

131
00:05:40,818 --> 00:05:43,995
- Today's gonna be weird,
isn't it?

132
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:46,389
- Uh, yeah.

133
00:05:46,433 --> 00:05:47,695
Yeah, no, I--

134
00:05:47,738 --> 00:05:50,088
I'd honestly rather
be pretty much anywhere

135
00:05:50,132 --> 00:05:52,482
but here right now.
- We can be.

136
00:05:54,615 --> 00:05:56,617
We could just

137
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,532
find something better to do.

138
00:06:00,098 --> 00:06:01,361
We?

139
00:06:07,454 --> 00:06:09,456
- We need a story, Lois,

140
00:06:09,499 --> 00:06:11,327
big story, front page,

141
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,198
catchy banner, something like

142
00:06:13,242 --> 00:06:15,200
"The Edge of Humanity."

143
00:06:15,244 --> 00:06:17,420
Maybe something
better than that.

144
00:06:17,464 --> 00:06:18,856
- It's a jumping-off point.

145
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,555
- This is the biggest story
of the year,

146
00:06:21,598 --> 00:06:23,078
the biggest story of my career.

147
00:06:23,121 --> 00:06:25,994
This is like Superman first
showing up in Metropolis big.

148
00:06:26,037 --> 00:06:27,474
- That's why we need to do
more interviews.

149
00:06:27,517 --> 00:06:29,084
What we're lacking
in hard evidence,

150
00:06:29,127 --> 00:06:31,260
we can make up for
with eyewitness testimonies.

151
00:06:31,303 --> 00:06:32,957
- Anything to back up
all this crazy.

152
00:06:33,001 --> 00:06:34,437
- We need to talk
to more Edge employees.

153
00:06:34,481 --> 00:06:35,960
We have to talk to the mayor--

154
00:06:36,004 --> 00:06:37,919
- Your dad.
- He doesn't do interviews.

155
00:06:37,962 --> 00:06:40,269
DOD always releases
a statement though.

156
00:06:40,312 --> 00:06:42,271
- When?
- I don't know, probably soon.

157
00:06:42,314 --> 00:06:45,840
- Lois, people
are calling here nonstop,

158
00:06:45,883 --> 00:06:48,930
freaking out, all with bits
and pieces of information,

159
00:06:48,973 --> 00:06:52,412
mostly gossip.
They're desperate for answers,

160
00:06:52,455 --> 00:06:54,152
and I feel a lot better
giving it to them

161
00:06:54,196 --> 00:06:56,633
if we had some kind
of verification from the DOD.

162
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:05,337
- I'll reach out to him
right now.

163
00:07:10,734 --> 00:07:12,214
- Home-cooked meal?

164
00:07:12,606 --> 00:07:15,347
- Oh.
Room and board, huh?

165
00:07:15,391 --> 00:07:17,698
- Hey, you saved my life.

166
00:07:17,741 --> 00:07:20,265
You saved the world.
As far as we're concerned,

167
00:07:20,309 --> 00:07:23,225
you eat free here
the rest of your life.

168
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:25,488
What's this?

169
00:07:25,532 --> 00:07:28,709
- My Kryptonian
tracking system.

170
00:07:28,752 --> 00:07:31,625
I enhanced the range to help
with our search for Larr.

171
00:07:31,668 --> 00:07:32,930
Might get lucky.

172
00:07:32,974 --> 00:07:34,758
- Is that how you found me?

173
00:07:35,977 --> 00:07:38,283
- More or less.
- You know, with your skills,

174
00:07:38,327 --> 00:07:40,068
Sam could really use
someone like you at the DOD.

175
00:07:40,111 --> 00:07:41,722
I could talk to him
if you want.

176
00:07:41,765 --> 00:07:42,940
- I don't think so.
Look, Clark,

177
00:07:42,984 --> 00:07:44,899
I appreciate you opening
your home to me,

178
00:07:44,942 --> 00:07:47,118
but once we find Leslie,

179
00:07:47,162 --> 00:07:49,599
I think I'm just gonna move on.

180
00:07:49,643 --> 00:07:52,602
Figure out now that
I'm on this planet,

181
00:07:52,646 --> 00:07:53,951
I oughta make it my home.

182
00:07:53,995 --> 00:07:56,519
- It may not seem like it,
but, uh,

183
00:07:56,563 --> 00:07:57,738
I know what you mean.

184
00:07:57,781 --> 00:07:59,914
Enjoy the food.

185
00:08:02,133 --> 00:08:04,658
- Detecting
a Kryptonian air mobile.

186
00:08:04,701 --> 00:08:06,747
- Where?
- She's heading for the DOD.

187
00:08:08,444 --> 00:08:09,750
- Prepare the suit.

188
00:08:09,793 --> 00:08:12,274
- Synching with all functions
now.

189
00:08:17,366 --> 00:08:19,890
- Sam, any sign of Larr?
- Negative.

190
00:08:19,934 --> 00:08:21,588
- Has the building
been evacuated?

191
00:08:21,631 --> 00:08:23,764
- Not yet.
About 60%.

192
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:24,852
- Sir, we got eyes on Larr.

193
00:08:28,246 --> 00:08:29,291
- ETA?

194
00:08:29,334 --> 00:08:31,554
- Impact in five seconds,

195
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:33,556
four, three,

196
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,776
two, one.

197
00:08:37,604 --> 00:08:38,735
- Intercepted.

198
00:08:45,786 --> 00:08:49,180
- You haven't won, Kal.

199
00:09:03,673 --> 00:09:07,459
- Nice shot.
- Thanks.

200
00:09:07,503 --> 00:09:08,765
- It's over,

201
00:09:08,809 --> 00:09:11,028
but we have loose ends
to tie up.

202
00:09:11,072 --> 00:09:12,900
- We got Edge and Larr.

203
00:09:12,943 --> 00:09:15,772
- I think it's safe to say
we can finally move on.

204
00:09:19,297 --> 00:09:20,603
- "7734."

205
00:09:20,647 --> 00:09:23,127
- I had those weapons built
for the wrong reasons.

206
00:09:23,171 --> 00:09:25,739
- What are you saying?
- I was wrong to think

207
00:09:25,782 --> 00:09:27,915
you could be
a threat to the world.

208
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:29,830
I'm gonna take that kryptonite
and those weapons,

209
00:09:29,873 --> 00:09:31,832
bury them in concrete

210
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:33,616
and sink them
to the bottom of the ocean.

211
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,400
- What about Edge?
Larr?

212
00:09:35,444 --> 00:09:38,665
- We'll keep enough
to guard them appropriately,

213
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:41,668
but there will no longer
be enough supply an army.

214
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:44,758
- I don't know what to say,
Sam.

215
00:09:44,801 --> 00:09:46,629
- Eh, you don't have
to say anything.

216
00:09:46,673 --> 00:09:49,763
Just know you, Lois, the boys,

217
00:09:49,806 --> 00:09:51,852
you don't have
to worry anymore.

218
00:09:54,332 --> 00:09:57,945
- Are you making fun of my car?
- No, no.

219
00:09:57,988 --> 00:09:59,729
- Says you--
you can't even drive.

220
00:09:59,773 --> 00:10:01,470
- I like the seat colors.

221
00:10:01,513 --> 00:10:02,645
Nice thread count.

222
00:10:05,387 --> 00:10:07,041
You guys live somewhere
out here, don't you?

223
00:10:07,084 --> 00:10:09,783
- Yeah, yeah, not too far
from here.

224
00:10:09,826 --> 00:10:11,132
How'd you know that?

225
00:10:11,175 --> 00:10:13,787
- Someone may have told me.

226
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:15,266
- Yeah?

227
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:17,878
What else did someone tell you?

228
00:10:17,921 --> 00:10:20,358
- That you have a girlfriend

229
00:10:20,402 --> 00:10:21,751
in Metropolis.

230
00:10:21,795 --> 00:10:24,232
- Nah.
Had.

231
00:10:24,275 --> 00:10:25,537
We broke up.

232
00:10:28,889 --> 00:10:31,979
- How about you?
Are you, um...

233
00:10:32,022 --> 00:10:34,155
Are you hanging out
with anyone or...

234
00:10:35,722 --> 00:10:38,072
- Nope, no one.

235
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,252
- Cool.

236
00:10:44,948 --> 00:10:45,906
- I think I know
where we can go.

237
00:10:45,949 --> 00:10:48,212
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

238
00:10:50,171 --> 00:10:51,520
- Okay.

239
00:10:52,826 --> 00:10:54,915
- You are a rule-breaker.

240
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:55,872
- Me?
- Mm-hmm.

241
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:57,439
- You've missed more days

242
00:10:57,482 --> 00:10:59,136
this year than any other kid
in school.

243
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:02,618
- I have a weak immune system.
-  Hmm.

244
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,141
- Uh-huh.

245
00:11:04,185 --> 00:11:07,710
- Anyways, thank you
for coming with me.

246
00:11:07,754 --> 00:11:09,277
- Of course.

247
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,888
Denise and Avery still giving
you crap about what happened?

248
00:11:11,932 --> 00:11:14,804
- I just know
they're talking about me,

249
00:11:14,848 --> 00:11:16,284
but it can't be worse

250
00:11:16,327 --> 00:11:18,721
than what they're saying
about my parents.

251
00:11:18,765 --> 00:11:19,722
- That's not fair.

252
00:11:19,766 --> 00:11:22,769
- I don't think fair
is a real thing.

253
00:11:23,726 --> 00:11:27,077
My mom, she's
a public relations queen, so--

254
00:11:27,121 --> 00:11:29,427
- Yeah, so what are you
so worried about then?

255
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:33,736
- My dad, he--
things like this

256
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,172
usually send him
over a cliff.

257
00:11:35,216 --> 00:11:39,350
I'm kind of just waiting
for that last little nudge.

258
00:11:39,394 --> 00:11:40,961
- Yeah.

259
00:11:42,049 --> 00:11:43,615
You know, are you sure
you don't want to go

260
00:11:43,659 --> 00:11:46,749
to the movies or like
Main Street or something?

261
00:11:46,793 --> 00:11:48,795
Something fun.

262
00:11:48,838 --> 00:11:50,797
- You tell me.

263
00:11:57,194 --> 00:11:58,543
- What about the bank?

264
00:11:58,587 --> 00:12:00,720
Any chance you could
get your old job back?

265
00:12:00,763 --> 00:12:01,938
- Mm-mm.

266
00:12:01,982 --> 00:12:04,462
No, they replaced me
as soon as I left.

267
00:12:04,506 --> 00:12:08,075
Besides, the whole thing
is tied up with that Edge mess.

268
00:12:08,118 --> 00:12:10,730
- Lana, what are we gonna do?

269
00:12:13,515 --> 00:12:15,125
Mitch.

270
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:18,868
- Oh, hey.

271
00:12:18,912 --> 00:12:20,827
- Hey.

272
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:22,524
Out of rehab, huh?

273
00:12:22,567 --> 00:12:24,308
- Not quite out yet.

274
00:12:24,352 --> 00:12:26,528
Just been craving
chicken and waffles.

275
00:12:26,571 --> 00:12:28,835
So the squad wanted
to treat me.

276
00:12:29,444 --> 00:12:30,793
- Oh, okay.

277
00:12:30,837 --> 00:12:32,099
- It just happened, Chief.

278
00:12:32,142 --> 00:12:34,231
- Yeah, I know how it happened.

279
00:12:34,275 --> 00:12:35,885
- Mayor Dean said he talked
to you about all this.

280
00:12:35,929 --> 00:12:37,147
- About leave of absence?

281
00:12:37,191 --> 00:12:38,453
Yeah, he talked to me
about that.

282
00:12:38,496 --> 00:12:39,802
Are you the one
pushing for it?

283
00:12:39,846 --> 00:12:41,456
- I think it's best
for everybody.

284
00:12:41,499 --> 00:12:43,327
- Especially someone
gunning for my job, right?

285
00:12:43,371 --> 00:12:45,852
- Kyle, they were thinking
about me and the fire,

286
00:12:45,895 --> 00:12:46,853
that's all.
- The fire,

287
00:12:46,896 --> 00:12:48,245
the one that I pulled you
out of?

288
00:12:48,289 --> 00:12:49,594
The one where
I saved your life, that fire?

289
00:12:49,638 --> 00:12:50,900
- The fire
Edge's freaks started.

290
00:12:50,944 --> 00:12:52,684
- Kyle--
- Oh, that's my fault?

291
00:12:52,728 --> 00:12:54,817
I knew as much about what Edge
is doing as the rest of y'all.

292
00:12:54,861 --> 00:12:56,688
-  Okay.
- Hey!

293
00:12:56,732 --> 00:12:59,735
I would never do anything
to hurt anyone.

294
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,606
Look, come on, y'all.

295
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:03,086
Y'all know me.

296
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:06,829
- Babe, let's go.
Come on.

297
00:13:13,009 --> 00:13:14,532
- I can't believe you.

298
00:13:14,576 --> 00:13:16,056
- I don't have time for
this, Lois.

299
00:13:16,099 --> 00:13:17,666
We are not releasing
an official statement,

300
00:13:17,709 --> 00:13:20,016
and that's it.
- But it's standard procedure.

301
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,539
- If anything, it's a courtesy.

302
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:23,237
- But you always
give a comment.

303
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,848
- Okay, no comment.
You can print that.

304
00:13:25,892 --> 00:13:28,242
- You can't be serious.
- We've already said enough.

305
00:13:28,285 --> 00:13:30,113
- Enough to create
more questions.

306
00:13:30,157 --> 00:13:31,680
Dad, people are worried.

307
00:13:31,723 --> 00:13:34,248
- As we speak, a pamphlet
is being made to address

308
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:37,033
the X-Kryptonite of it all.
- A work of fiction.

309
00:13:37,077 --> 00:13:38,861
- But it will alleviate
their concerns

310
00:13:38,905 --> 00:13:41,995
while also scaring them into
staying out of those mines.

311
00:13:42,038 --> 00:13:44,954
- This isn't right.
- It's necessary.

312
00:13:44,998 --> 00:13:47,957
- Dad, this is my home now.
These people are my neighbors.

313
00:13:48,001 --> 00:13:50,046
- What am I supposed to say?

314
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:51,918
That Edge
is Superman's brother?

315
00:13:51,961 --> 00:13:53,658
That he was using those people

316
00:13:53,702 --> 00:13:55,922
to build a Kryptonian army
to take over the world?

317
00:13:55,965 --> 00:13:57,053
- No, of course not.

318
00:13:57,097 --> 00:13:58,838
- I know it's not
what you wanna hear,

319
00:13:58,881 --> 00:14:00,361
but you need to run your story
with the bare minimum.

320
00:14:00,404 --> 00:14:02,885
Eventually, this town
will be okay.

321
00:14:02,929 --> 00:14:04,452
Trust me.

322
00:14:04,495 --> 00:14:06,671
But the last thing our family
needs is for this story

323
00:14:06,715 --> 00:14:09,326
to get out of Smallville,
and any quote from me

324
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:12,068
will give it the legitimacy
for that to happen.

325
00:14:28,345 --> 00:14:31,653
- Stop.

326
00:14:31,696 --> 00:14:34,090
Finally, you are ready.

327
00:14:34,134 --> 00:14:35,352
- Now what, Father?

328
00:14:35,396 --> 00:14:38,529
- You will leave here
to find the Eradicator.

329
00:14:38,573 --> 00:14:41,924
- And if it hasn't yet arrived?
- Stay there until it does.

330
00:14:41,968 --> 00:14:43,143
- By myself?

331
00:14:43,186 --> 00:14:44,971
That could mean years.

332
00:14:45,014 --> 00:14:45,972
It's already been many.

333
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,408
- Study them.

334
00:14:47,451 --> 00:14:49,889
Exploit their weaknesses
and profit from it.

335
00:14:49,932 --> 00:14:52,892
Prepare for our resurrection.

336
00:14:52,935 --> 00:14:55,155
- Then perhaps before I go,

337
00:14:55,198 --> 00:14:57,809
I could engage with mother,

338
00:14:57,853 --> 00:15:00,334
get her counsel,
meet her once before I leave.

339
00:15:00,377 --> 00:15:02,771
- I've told you repeatedly
that your mother

340
00:15:02,814 --> 00:15:04,120
would never be by my side.

341
00:15:04,164 --> 00:15:05,992
- Then why include
a crystal in my pod?

342
00:15:06,035 --> 00:15:08,168
- So she can witness my vision

343
00:15:08,211 --> 00:15:10,997
for how Krypton
will be restored...

344
00:15:12,215 --> 00:15:15,044
Before I extinguish her
forever.

345
00:15:15,088 --> 00:15:17,699
- Please.

346
00:15:17,742 --> 00:15:18,700
Just once.

347
00:15:18,743 --> 00:15:20,093
- Leave.

348
00:15:20,136 --> 00:15:22,922
And do not return
until the day is here.

349
00:15:26,882 --> 00:15:28,579
- Goodbye.

350
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:35,673
- One last time,
where's the Eradicator?

351
00:15:38,285 --> 00:15:41,375
I told you
it's of no use to you.

352
00:15:41,418 --> 00:15:43,203
- If you don't wanna
tell me, fine.

353
00:15:43,246 --> 00:15:45,205
We have everything else,

354
00:15:45,248 --> 00:15:46,206
including Leslie.

355
00:15:46,249 --> 00:15:48,382
She's locked up now,
same as you.

356
00:15:48,425 --> 00:15:50,210
Stopped her before
she could break you out.

357
00:15:50,253 --> 00:15:52,168
I don't know what the plan was,
but it wasn't a good one.

358
00:15:52,212 --> 00:15:53,256
- It's called loyalty,

359
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,954
something you know
nothing about.

360
00:15:54,997 --> 00:15:58,000
- I am loyal to the people
of this world who accepted me.

361
00:16:00,002 --> 00:16:02,700
Accepted you?

362
00:16:02,744 --> 00:16:04,050
They fear you.

363
00:16:04,093 --> 00:16:05,965
They always will,
and they should.

364
00:16:06,008 --> 00:16:07,009
- You're wrong.

365
00:16:07,053 --> 00:16:09,142
- You should be a god,

366
00:16:09,185 --> 00:16:10,882
but you became a slave to them.

367
00:16:10,926 --> 00:16:14,103
Don't you ever wonder
who you might've been

368
00:16:14,147 --> 00:16:15,539
if you hadn't landed here,

369
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:17,411
been raised by simple farmers?

370
00:16:17,454 --> 00:16:20,240
- I'd be nothing like you.
- We both know that's not true.

371
00:16:20,283 --> 00:16:24,026
You fight against
your real nature every day.

372
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:25,201
- You don't know me.

373
00:16:25,245 --> 00:16:27,769
- I know the power
surging through you.

374
00:16:27,812 --> 00:16:31,164
I know how every moment
you make a choice

375
00:16:31,207 --> 00:16:32,730
to hold yourself back,

376
00:16:32,774 --> 00:16:35,037
because that's the only way
we can walk amongst humans

377
00:16:35,081 --> 00:16:37,126
without killing them, isn't it?

378
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:39,128
It's all about control.

379
00:16:39,172 --> 00:16:41,957
But didn't it feel good

380
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:45,961
to lose it just once?

381
00:16:51,793 --> 00:16:53,577
- Goodbye, Tal.

382
00:16:56,841 --> 00:16:59,496
- I can see it
in your eyes, brother.

383
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,804
You felt it.

384
00:17:03,892 --> 00:17:06,721
You are just like me!

385
00:17:14,337 --> 00:17:17,297
- No comment?
They always give a comment.

386
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:18,559
- Yeah, I don't know
what to say.

387
00:17:18,602 --> 00:17:20,126
- Well, is it because
we're a small paper?

388
00:17:20,169 --> 00:17:22,389
You always got a statement
when you were at the "Planet."

389
00:17:22,432 --> 00:17:24,739
- Chrissy, we don't need
the DOD or my dad.

390
00:17:24,782 --> 00:17:27,089
We can do more interviews
and write what we want.

391
00:17:27,133 --> 00:17:29,396
- It just doesn't
make any sense.

392
00:17:29,439 --> 00:17:31,702
Is this story
different somehow?

393
00:17:32,964 --> 00:17:34,401
- Not that I know of.

394
00:17:35,315 --> 00:17:38,274
- Lois, what is he hiding?

395
00:17:40,363 --> 00:17:42,148
- I don't know, Chrissy.

396
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,153
- Are lying right now?

397
00:17:47,196 --> 00:17:49,024
- No.

398
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:50,808
- You're totally lying.

399
00:17:50,852 --> 00:17:52,462
- Chrissy, it's not
what you think.

400
00:17:52,506 --> 00:17:54,638
- Lois Lane is protectingthe DOD.

401
00:17:54,682 --> 00:17:56,727
You're supposed to be
on the side of the people,

402
00:17:56,771 --> 00:17:57,902
not the man.

403
00:17:57,946 --> 00:17:59,730
I thought we were
in this together.

404
00:17:59,774 --> 00:18:01,297
- Chrissy--
- Lois, if you can't tell me

405
00:18:01,341 --> 00:18:05,214
the truth,
then maybe you should leave.

406
00:18:17,444 --> 00:18:20,142
- You know your mom's
a legit role model.

407
00:18:20,186 --> 00:18:21,578
- Yeah?

408
00:18:21,622 --> 00:18:23,624
One year I even dressed up
as her for career day.

409
00:18:23,667 --> 00:18:26,670
- Okay, well,
full disclosure,

410
00:18:26,714 --> 00:18:28,368
I did too.

411
00:18:28,411 --> 00:18:30,587
-  What?
- Yeah.

412
00:18:30,631 --> 00:18:33,503
- Your family is really cool.
- Nah.

413
00:18:33,547 --> 00:18:35,810
- Well, between your mom
and your grandfather,

414
00:18:35,853 --> 00:18:37,246
there's no question.

415
00:18:38,204 --> 00:18:40,336
- So you heard
about my grandpa

416
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,903
from someone?

417
00:18:41,946 --> 00:18:44,166
- From everyone.
I mean, your family is kind of

418
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:47,996
in the middle of the biggest
thing to happen to Smallville.

419
00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:50,129
Do you think those people
were actually brainwashed?

420
00:18:50,172 --> 00:18:51,826
- What?

421
00:18:51,869 --> 00:18:56,787
- They're saying that Edge was
experimenting on his employees.

422
00:18:56,831 --> 00:19:00,878
My cousin said that she saw
Avery Phan's mom fly.

423
00:19:00,922 --> 00:19:04,143
- I heard about that.
That's--that's crazy, right?

424
00:19:04,186 --> 00:19:05,796
- Well, what does
your grandpa think?

425
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,713
Does he know how Edge
gave them all the powers?

426
00:19:11,976 --> 00:19:14,544
- Tegan, why did you
bring me here?

427
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,591
- I wanna get to know you.

428
00:19:17,634 --> 00:19:19,723
- I mean, you weren't
interested in me last week,

429
00:19:19,767 --> 00:19:22,204
and then what--
I mean, what changed?

430
00:19:22,248 --> 00:19:23,771
I don't know, Jonathan.

431
00:19:23,814 --> 00:19:28,123
I just--
- Just wanted information.

432
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:31,170
- Well, we're also hanging out.

433
00:19:32,954 --> 00:19:34,347
- Yeah.

434
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:36,653
Uh, I think
I'm gonna walk home.

435
00:19:36,697 --> 00:19:39,178
- Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, Jonathan.

436
00:19:41,441 --> 00:19:43,312
Everyone wants to know
what happened.

437
00:19:43,356 --> 00:19:44,705
- Right.

438
00:19:44,748 --> 00:19:46,968
And obviously, you want
to be the one to tell them.

439
00:19:47,011 --> 00:19:50,101
So I get it.

440
00:19:50,145 --> 00:19:51,799
See ya.

441
00:19:58,371 --> 00:20:01,330
- I mean, did you even see
the way they looked at me, huh?

442
00:20:01,374 --> 00:20:02,766
My own crew
doesn't even trust me.

443
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:05,508
- Kyle, you can't take it
personally, babe.

444
00:20:05,552 --> 00:20:07,206
- It ain't right, okay?

445
00:20:07,249 --> 00:20:09,556
You know, you risked your life
to save this town.

446
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:11,688
Maybe if these people
knew about that they--

447
00:20:11,732 --> 00:20:14,387
- What, you think
they'd believe it?

448
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:16,867
I barely do, and I was there.

449
00:20:16,911 --> 00:20:19,609
- Damn it.
Lana, it--it's just not fair.

450
00:20:19,653 --> 00:20:23,309
- No, it's not.
It sucks.

451
00:20:23,352 --> 00:20:25,311
But the mayor has our back.

452
00:20:25,354 --> 00:20:28,749
We just have to be patient.
We're not alone in this.

453
00:20:29,793 --> 00:20:31,360
- Okay.

454
00:20:31,404 --> 00:20:35,016
But look, I cannot just stand
around here and do nothing.

455
00:20:36,931 --> 00:20:41,109
- Well, you can help me
look for a job.

456
00:20:41,152 --> 00:20:42,371
- Well, finding something
around here

457
00:20:42,415 --> 00:20:43,285
is gonna be a long shot.

458
00:20:43,329 --> 00:20:46,332
- I know, but I was thinking

459
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:48,377
we could look
in the surrounding areas.

460
00:20:48,421 --> 00:20:52,033
- Yeah, we could also move to
one of the surrounding areas.

461
00:20:52,076 --> 00:20:53,295
- Kyle--

462
00:20:53,339 --> 00:20:55,428
- If we're throwing out
options, why not?

463
00:20:56,472 --> 00:20:57,952
- Oh, my gosh.
You're serious?

464
00:20:57,995 --> 00:21:00,389
- Lana, these people have
known us our entire lives.

465
00:21:00,433 --> 00:21:04,045
You know, what's it say about
them if they're just so quick

466
00:21:04,088 --> 00:21:06,352
to turn their backs
on us like that, huh?

467
00:21:06,395 --> 00:21:09,442
- These people,
they're our family.

468
00:21:10,356 --> 00:21:12,532
Look, this will blow over.

469
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:15,665
- I guess we'll see
about that, huh?

470
00:21:18,146 --> 00:21:20,191
- How'd you find this place?

471
00:21:22,237 --> 00:21:26,981
- I used to come here
with mi abuelita.

472
00:21:27,024 --> 00:21:30,419
She'd tell me stories
about my family.

473
00:21:30,463 --> 00:21:31,899
We're originally from Mexico,

474
00:21:31,942 --> 00:21:36,033
but we've been in Smallville
for generations, so.

475
00:21:36,077 --> 00:21:38,427
You know, half the time
I wouldn't even know

476
00:21:38,471 --> 00:21:39,950
which one of her stories
were true,

477
00:21:39,994 --> 00:21:43,563
But it always just made me feel

478
00:21:43,606 --> 00:21:46,348
like I had somewhere to belong.

479
00:21:46,392 --> 00:21:49,569
- I never really felt
like I belonged anywhere...

480
00:21:52,485 --> 00:21:54,922
To be honest until I met you.

481
00:21:54,965 --> 00:21:56,097
- Jordan--

482
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:58,012
- I know, I know,
I know, whatever,

483
00:21:58,055 --> 00:22:01,450
but it's--look all I'm saying
is that it only really takes

484
00:22:01,494 --> 00:22:04,235
one person
to change your whole life,

485
00:22:04,279 --> 00:22:06,150
just to make you feel safe.

486
00:22:06,194 --> 00:22:07,456
And you have Jon,

487
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,415
and you have your family,

488
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:11,591
and you have me...

489
00:22:13,593 --> 00:22:16,204
And that's never going away.

490
00:22:19,947 --> 00:22:23,211
- You should
probably kiss me now.

491
00:22:23,254 --> 00:22:25,431
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

492
00:22:32,176 --> 00:22:33,482
- That's enough, you two.

493
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:40,576
- We've got about two
dozen rifles and handguns,

494
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:42,448
a few thousand
kryptonite bullets,

495
00:22:42,491 --> 00:22:46,408
give or take in addition
to a substantial collection:

496
00:22:46,452 --> 00:22:49,106
knives, swords, spears.

497
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:51,239
- What about the prototypes
in the R&D lab,

498
00:22:51,282 --> 00:22:52,719
the biochemical weapons?

499
00:22:52,762 --> 00:22:56,418
- Maybe five or so in
varying stages of development.

500
00:22:56,462 --> 00:22:58,551
- And how much raw kryptonite
do you have in your stockpile?

501
00:22:58,594 --> 00:23:01,336
- A couple of warehouses worth.
Why all the questions?

502
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,033
It's all gonna be gone anyway.

503
00:23:05,862 --> 00:23:08,648
- I think it's a mistake.
- What?

504
00:23:08,691 --> 00:23:11,215
- We need 7734.

505
00:23:11,259 --> 00:23:13,043
That's why you authorized it
in the first place.

506
00:23:13,087 --> 00:23:15,916
- And then I saw
how it hurt my family.

507
00:23:15,959 --> 00:23:17,439
These weapons can kill you.

508
00:23:17,483 --> 00:23:19,267
- Yeah, that's why
we need them.

509
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:21,661
- Clark, you're not the enemy.

510
00:23:21,704 --> 00:23:24,272
- Yeah, but I could have been.

511
00:23:24,315 --> 00:23:26,666
Look, Sam, people like me,

512
00:23:26,709 --> 00:23:28,842
without these weapons,

513
00:23:28,885 --> 00:23:30,539
we're indestructible,

514
00:23:30,583 --> 00:23:32,193
and if something like this
should happen again

515
00:23:32,236 --> 00:23:35,109
without a plan in place,
without a fail-safe...

516
00:23:36,676 --> 00:23:38,417
That would be the end.

517
00:24:00,569 --> 00:24:02,049
- Well done, John,

518
00:24:02,092 --> 00:24:04,878
a perfect recreation
of the original design.

519
00:24:04,921 --> 00:24:07,837
I believe Natalie
would be proud.

520
00:24:08,925 --> 00:24:10,623
Given that
your suit is complete

521
00:24:10,666 --> 00:24:13,626
and all enemy combatants
are now in custody,

522
00:24:13,669 --> 00:24:16,542
may I inquire as
to our new mission parameters?

523
00:24:16,585 --> 00:24:18,369
- I'm still working that out.

524
00:24:18,413 --> 00:24:20,894
- Perhaps another attempt
to see your sister?

525
00:24:20,937 --> 00:24:22,852
- You know,
you're getting kind of pushy.

526
00:24:22,896 --> 00:24:25,333
- I am programmed
to anticipate your needs.

527
00:24:25,376 --> 00:24:27,291
Optimal psychological
health requires

528
00:24:27,335 --> 00:24:31,600
the formation of
interpersonal relationships.

529
00:24:31,644 --> 00:24:33,210
- Hey, sorry.

530
00:24:33,254 --> 00:24:36,257
I just got home
and heard voices, so...

531
00:24:38,389 --> 00:24:42,568
So you really built this thing
from scratch, huh?

532
00:24:45,353 --> 00:24:47,181
Pretty amazing.

533
00:24:49,618 --> 00:24:51,925
- You're a gear head?

534
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:54,101
- I don't know what I am.

535
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,193
Always been an athlete,
you know, so...

536
00:24:59,236 --> 00:25:01,021
- Me too.

537
00:25:01,064 --> 00:25:03,414
You know, you can be
more than one thing.

538
00:25:03,458 --> 00:25:05,678
- Perhaps you could
tell Jonathan a tale

539
00:25:05,721 --> 00:25:06,809
from your own upbringing.

540
00:25:06,853 --> 00:25:09,638
- Would you please
just shut down.

541
00:25:09,682 --> 00:25:12,728
- Jonathan?

542
00:25:12,772 --> 00:25:14,774
Why aren't you in school?

543
00:25:21,694 --> 00:25:23,783
- This better
be about the statement.

544
00:25:23,826 --> 00:25:25,654
- Not now, Lois.
It's important.

545
00:25:25,698 --> 00:25:28,657
- What's wrong?
- It's about Clark.

546
00:25:28,701 --> 00:25:31,268
I'm worried about him.

547
00:25:50,461 --> 00:25:51,637
- Hey, Soph.

548
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:54,683
- Mom, is anything wrong?

549
00:25:55,728 --> 00:25:57,164
- What do you mean, sweets?

550
00:25:57,207 --> 00:26:00,167
- Dad asked me if I wanted
to try another school.

551
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:03,257
- No, baby.
Daddy was just asking.

552
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:06,695
Hold on, okay?

553
00:26:11,395 --> 00:26:13,310
Hello.

554
00:26:13,354 --> 00:26:16,183
Oh, hey, Kya.

555
00:26:16,226 --> 00:26:17,576
Arrested?

556
00:26:17,619 --> 00:26:19,578
- Jon, it's not like you
to break the rules.

557
00:26:19,621 --> 00:26:22,145
- I know, I know, but there's
this girl, and she's a junior.

558
00:26:22,189 --> 00:26:23,756
And I don't know.
I thought--

559
00:26:23,799 --> 00:26:25,235
I thought she was out
of my league, you know?

560
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:26,715
- You skipped class
to impress a girl?

561
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:28,238
- Well, that's the thing.

562
00:26:28,282 --> 00:26:29,979
She just wanted to talk
about what happened,

563
00:26:30,023 --> 00:26:33,592
like, Edge, powers, Grandpa...

564
00:26:34,462 --> 00:26:35,811
- And?

565
00:26:35,855 --> 00:26:37,378
- I mean,
I didn't say anything.

566
00:26:37,421 --> 00:26:38,814
- We need to talk.

567
00:26:38,858 --> 00:26:41,121
- Yeah, we do.
Jon skipped class.

568
00:26:41,164 --> 00:26:42,688
- What?
Go upstairs.

569
00:26:42,731 --> 00:26:45,168
I will deal with you later.

570
00:26:48,128 --> 00:26:49,608
We can talk about him

571
00:26:49,651 --> 00:26:51,610
after we talk about
what I wanna talk about.

572
00:26:53,046 --> 00:26:56,266
You told my dad to keep 7734?
- I did, I did.

573
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:57,790
I should have talked
to you first.

574
00:26:57,833 --> 00:27:00,619
- Jonathan, upstairs.

575
00:27:01,968 --> 00:27:03,796
After everything
we've been through--

576
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:05,362
- I know.
I know.

577
00:27:05,406 --> 00:27:06,799
- Why?

578
00:27:06,842 --> 00:27:08,278
- Because it's
the right thing to do.

579
00:27:08,322 --> 00:27:10,237
- This isn't about Edge, is it?
This is about you.

580
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,717
- Lois, I almost
killed John Irons.

581
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,806
- But you didn't.
- Yeah, but what if I had?

582
00:27:13,849 --> 00:27:15,895
I mean,
who would have been next?

583
00:27:15,938 --> 00:27:17,853
Look, I swore to protect
the people of this planet.

584
00:27:17,897 --> 00:27:19,333
So far, I've done a decent job,

585
00:27:19,376 --> 00:27:21,248
but what if I was
to be tricked or corrupted?

586
00:27:21,291 --> 00:27:24,991
- That will never happen.
- Except that it just did.

587
00:27:25,818 --> 00:27:27,602
The people of this
world deserve

588
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:28,864
the means to defend themselves

589
00:27:28,908 --> 00:27:31,040
from the one thing
I can't save them from: me.

590
00:27:31,084 --> 00:27:32,781
- If weapons like that exist,

591
00:27:32,825 --> 00:27:34,957
then the wrong people
will get their hands on them,

592
00:27:35,001 --> 00:27:38,308
and then what do we do?

593
00:27:41,703 --> 00:27:42,704
Not enough to skip school.

594
00:27:42,748 --> 00:27:44,750
This one has
to go get arrested.

595
00:27:44,793 --> 00:27:45,794
- If they're both acting out,

596
00:27:45,838 --> 00:27:47,013
we'll give them a punishment.

597
00:27:47,056 --> 00:27:48,492
I'll drive.

598
00:27:48,536 --> 00:27:49,929
- Lois, about the other thing?
- What?

599
00:27:49,972 --> 00:27:51,452
I'm right.
You're wrong.

600
00:27:51,495 --> 00:27:53,846
- I understand why
you would think that.

601
00:27:53,889 --> 00:27:55,238
- Do you know what it was like

602
00:27:55,282 --> 00:27:56,979
when my dad
gave John Henry Irons

603
00:27:57,023 --> 00:27:58,851
the go-ahead
to fire the missile?

604
00:27:58,894 --> 00:28:00,200
- I'm sorry.

605
00:28:00,243 --> 00:28:01,723
- Then why risk
it happening again?

606
00:28:01,767 --> 00:28:02,985
- I told you because it's--

607
00:28:03,029 --> 00:28:04,552
- Because it's
the right thing to do.

608
00:28:04,595 --> 00:28:06,728
What does that
even mean anymore, Clark?

609
00:28:06,772 --> 00:28:09,862
I lied to Chrissy today
to protect our family.

610
00:28:09,905 --> 00:28:12,778
I broke my sacred role
as a journalist.

611
00:28:12,821 --> 00:28:14,214
- We both play fast and loose

612
00:28:14,257 --> 00:28:15,955
with journalistic integrity
from time to time.

613
00:28:15,998 --> 00:28:17,957
- When it comes
to keeping your secret,

614
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,436
not the stories we investigate.

615
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,786
- Yeah,
but Edge is my brother.

616
00:28:20,829 --> 00:28:23,092
He's Kryptonian.
This story is different.

617
00:28:23,136 --> 00:28:25,921
- Why should I be okay with the
military having the secret code

618
00:28:25,965 --> 00:28:27,183
to kill my husband,

619
00:28:27,227 --> 00:28:29,969
given the countless psychos
who want you dead?

620
00:28:30,012 --> 00:28:32,928
It just feels like
a really bad idea.

621
00:28:33,537 --> 00:28:35,061
- Lois, will you please
just listen--

622
00:28:35,104 --> 00:28:36,845
- No, there's nothing you can
say that I wanna hear,

623
00:28:36,889 --> 00:28:39,892
and now I'm angry, and I feel
sorry for yelling at you,

624
00:28:39,935 --> 00:28:41,676
but I also have to stay angry

625
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,199
so that I can scare
the hell out of Jordan.

626
00:28:43,243 --> 00:28:45,027
So why don't you
just stay here,

627
00:28:45,071 --> 00:28:46,812
and let's just both
take a moment to think,

628
00:28:46,855 --> 00:28:47,813
and then we can talk
about this later

629
00:28:47,856 --> 00:28:50,685
after I bail our son
out of jail.

630
00:29:09,138 --> 00:29:11,184
- What were you doing?
- I can't believe you, guys.

631
00:29:11,227 --> 00:29:14,317
- I can explain.
- I'm so sorry.

632
00:29:14,361 --> 00:29:16,885
- Lana, and you must
be Jordan's mom.

633
00:29:16,929 --> 00:29:18,800
- Kya, what's going on?

634
00:29:18,844 --> 00:29:21,455
- They were caught trespassing
out by Atlas Pond.

635
00:29:21,498 --> 00:29:23,457
- Are you kidding me?

636
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,981
When we were their age, we used
to go there all the time.

637
00:29:26,025 --> 00:29:26,939
- I don't know what to tell you

638
00:29:26,982 --> 00:29:28,114
other than
it's private property.

639
00:29:29,855 --> 00:29:32,596
- Deputy, if Lana didn't even
know it was private property,

640
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,381
then I'm sure
the kids didn't either,

641
00:29:34,424 --> 00:29:35,948
and I promise you,
there's a world

642
00:29:35,991 --> 00:29:37,427
of just unimaginable horror

643
00:29:37,471 --> 00:29:39,995
that awaits my son
for skipping school.

644
00:29:40,039 --> 00:29:42,955
- The same goes for Sarah.
This will never happen again.

645
00:29:42,998 --> 00:29:44,870
- Just because she let you
two go with a warning

646
00:29:44,913 --> 00:29:46,523
doesn't mean it didn't happen.
- Mom--

647
00:29:46,567 --> 00:29:48,830
- Don't talk yet.
- As I've been saying,

648
00:29:48,874 --> 00:29:50,919
the Cushings
are the real problem here.

649
00:29:50,963 --> 00:29:52,878
Honestly, Sheriff,
I was suspicious

650
00:29:52,921 --> 00:29:54,444
of Morgan Edge from day one.

651
00:29:54,488 --> 00:29:56,316
But you know Kyle,
he just pushed and pushed

652
00:29:56,359 --> 00:29:58,971
until he finally got his way.

653
00:29:59,014 --> 00:30:01,277
I mean, honestly,

654
00:30:01,321 --> 00:30:03,758
we're the real victims here.

655
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:05,455
Who knows what kind of perks

656
00:30:05,499 --> 00:30:08,284
they got from Lana's
special little job.

657
00:30:08,894 --> 00:30:11,418
- Zero perks.
- Lana--

658
00:30:11,461 --> 00:30:13,855
- We got lied to just
like everyone else.

659
00:30:13,899 --> 00:30:16,727
Just like you lied when you
said you were gonna help us.

660
00:30:16,771 --> 00:30:18,251
- Why don't you and I
go talk somewhere else?

661
00:30:18,294 --> 00:30:20,949
- You said you were gonna
set the record straight,

662
00:30:20,993 --> 00:30:23,343
and all you're doing
is covering your ass

663
00:30:23,386 --> 00:30:25,954
so you don't feel the blowback
come election time.

664
00:30:25,998 --> 00:30:27,086
- I'm doing what's best
for the town.

665
00:30:27,129 --> 00:30:29,044
- You're doing
what's best for you

666
00:30:29,088 --> 00:30:30,872
at the expense of my family,

667
00:30:30,916 --> 00:30:34,006
and for that, shame on you.

668
00:30:40,055 --> 00:30:41,187
- You okay?

669
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:42,971
- I don't know
what I am right now.

670
00:30:43,015 --> 00:30:45,582
I feel so many things.
- Mostly anger, right?

671
00:30:45,626 --> 00:30:49,456
- So much anger.
Have you ever noticed--

672
00:30:49,499 --> 00:30:50,936
- How punchable
the mayor's face is?

673
00:30:50,979 --> 00:30:52,502
Yeah, I have.

674
00:30:52,546 --> 00:30:53,590
- God.

675
00:30:53,634 --> 00:30:56,942
You know,
he's not the only one.

676
00:30:56,985 --> 00:30:59,074
I mean, it's like
this entire town

677
00:30:59,118 --> 00:31:00,336
has turned their back on us.

678
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:02,077
- They're just looking
for a way to move on.

679
00:31:02,121 --> 00:31:04,514
Blaming you is easier
than blaming themselves.

680
00:31:04,558 --> 00:31:07,039
- Yeah, but it doesn't
make it hurt any less.

681
00:31:07,082 --> 00:31:09,389
Smallville has always
been there for me.

682
00:31:09,432 --> 00:31:11,913
It's why I built
my life around it,

683
00:31:11,957 --> 00:31:14,916
and now I'm wishing
I had a backup plan

684
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,136
because I'm out there
in the cold

685
00:31:17,179 --> 00:31:19,007
with no nest egg

686
00:31:19,051 --> 00:31:20,704
and no connections
anywhere else.

687
00:31:20,748 --> 00:31:24,273
And I am worried
about my family, Lois,

688
00:31:24,317 --> 00:31:26,493
especially when people
like Mayor Dean

689
00:31:26,536 --> 00:31:28,582
are out there
controlling the narrative.

690
00:31:28,625 --> 00:31:32,716
It's not right.
It's not right.

691
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:36,198
And it's not the same town
I used to love.

692
00:31:42,683 --> 00:31:45,860
- Go to your room.
We'll talk about this later.

693
00:31:51,126 --> 00:31:53,041
- Hey.

694
00:31:53,085 --> 00:31:55,522
- They let them go
with a warning.

695
00:31:57,828 --> 00:31:59,787
- That's good.

696
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:02,485
Jon's still up in his room.

697
00:32:04,009 --> 00:32:05,880
We should talk about--
- We need to talk about--

698
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,797
- You first.

699
00:32:14,019 --> 00:32:16,151
- Clark, you are wrong.

700
00:32:16,195 --> 00:32:19,415
Lois, we have to have a plan.

701
00:32:19,459 --> 00:32:20,547
- Why?

702
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:22,331
Because your mind
is corruptible?

703
00:32:22,375 --> 00:32:24,246
We have proof now.

704
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:27,119
Your heart is stronger
than your mind.

705
00:32:27,162 --> 00:32:28,772
- No, you don't understand.

706
00:32:28,816 --> 00:32:30,774
- Clark, I'm all
about backup plans,

707
00:32:30,818 --> 00:32:33,212
but this one comes
with major risks,

708
00:32:33,255 --> 00:32:36,084
and for a reason
you've proven isn't a threat.

709
00:32:37,999 --> 00:32:40,523
That's not entirely true.

710
00:32:42,264 --> 00:32:44,223
- What are you talking about?

711
00:32:50,142 --> 00:32:52,448
- My dad taught me control.

712
00:32:53,754 --> 00:32:55,930
I have been controlling
my powers

713
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,236
every second of every day

714
00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:00,108
for almost 40 years,

715
00:33:00,152 --> 00:33:01,980
but when Zod took over,

716
00:33:02,023 --> 00:33:03,329
for the first time,

717
00:33:03,372 --> 00:33:06,375
I felt what it was like
to let go.

718
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:10,075
To really let go.

719
00:33:10,118 --> 00:33:13,034
- Clark, those were
Zod's emotions, not yours.

720
00:33:13,078 --> 00:33:16,124
- I know, but I felt it.

721
00:33:16,168 --> 00:33:18,300
It was me.

722
00:33:19,345 --> 00:33:22,261
And I'm not saying
I want this to be true.

723
00:33:22,304 --> 00:33:24,524
I wish it wasn't...

724
00:33:28,136 --> 00:33:30,399
But it felt good.

725
00:33:30,443 --> 00:33:33,141
It felt really, really good,

726
00:33:33,185 --> 00:33:35,317
and that feeling worries me.

727
00:33:35,361 --> 00:33:37,624
If there's even
the slightest chance that

728
00:33:37,667 --> 00:33:41,671
I could be manipulated again
with that desire to let go...

729
00:33:45,414 --> 00:33:48,722
The world needs a way
to stop me.

730
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:51,986
- I don't think
that will ever happen.

731
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:54,510
- Lois--
- But...

732
00:33:54,554 --> 00:33:57,600
on the off chance I'm wrong,

733
00:33:57,644 --> 00:34:01,213
and if this will make you
feel better, then fine.

734
00:34:01,256 --> 00:34:02,475
Let's have a fail-safe,

735
00:34:02,518 --> 00:34:05,304
but there is no way in hell

736
00:34:05,347 --> 00:34:07,436
I'm trusting the DOD with this.

737
00:34:09,525 --> 00:34:12,311
- Then we just have to find
someone we can.

738
00:34:12,354 --> 00:34:14,313
- You wanna run that
by me again?

739
00:34:14,356 --> 00:34:16,097
- I know it's a lot to ask.

740
00:34:16,141 --> 00:34:18,795
- You want me and only me

741
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:20,319
to have the capability
to kill you?

742
00:34:20,362 --> 00:34:23,496
- Should it become
necessary, yes.

743
00:34:24,236 --> 00:34:26,107
- But I know who you are now.

744
00:34:26,151 --> 00:34:29,067
- I know, but this is about
situations we can't predict,

745
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:31,199
and you've seen firsthand

746
00:34:31,243 --> 00:34:33,158
the devastation
I can cause this world.

747
00:34:33,201 --> 00:34:34,246
- I'm trying to move on.

748
00:34:34,289 --> 00:34:36,813
Remember, now that killing you

749
00:34:36,857 --> 00:34:38,250
isn't my singular purpose
in life...

750
00:34:38,293 --> 00:34:39,990
- And it shouldn't be.

751
00:34:40,034 --> 00:34:42,297
John, I have no doubt you'll
find your way in this world,

752
00:34:42,341 --> 00:34:46,345
but I believe you can do that
and be 7734's gatekeeper.

753
00:34:47,433 --> 00:34:50,305
You came here to protect
this world from me,

754
00:34:50,349 --> 00:34:52,612
that's what
I'm asking you to do.

755
00:34:57,225 --> 00:34:58,748
- I'll call Sam.

756
00:35:10,151 --> 00:35:13,241
- Wasn't expecting to see you.

757
00:35:13,285 --> 00:35:15,287
- I owe you an apology.

758
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:17,419
- Kinda busy, Lois.

759
00:35:19,421 --> 00:35:22,163
- You were right.I lied.

760
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:26,472
My dad is hiding something,
and I can't betray his trust.

761
00:35:26,515 --> 00:35:29,257
- This story is bigger
than you or your dad.

762
00:35:29,301 --> 00:35:31,564
We have a responsibility
to the people.

763
00:35:31,607 --> 00:35:33,218
This town is falling apart.

764
00:35:33,261 --> 00:35:35,350
- Believe me, I know.

765
00:35:35,394 --> 00:35:37,178
People are tearing
each other down,

766
00:35:37,222 --> 00:35:39,224
looking for someone to blame,
and if we do nothing,

767
00:35:39,267 --> 00:35:42,183
we are as responsible for
its downfall as anyone else.

768
00:35:42,227 --> 00:35:44,316
- If only there was something
we could do.

769
00:35:44,359 --> 00:35:45,534
- I can't write this story.

770
00:35:45,578 --> 00:35:49,059
I'm too close to it
to be objective...

771
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,672
But you can.

772
00:36:01,376 --> 00:36:04,510
- It's a statement...
from your dad.

773
00:36:04,553 --> 00:36:06,512
- He wouldn't go on the record
about everything,

774
00:36:06,555 --> 00:36:08,514
but this is enough
to tell most of the story

775
00:36:08,557 --> 00:36:11,343
and to focus the blame
where it belongs:

776
00:36:11,386 --> 00:36:13,214
on Morgan Edge.

777
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:17,305
- This was really
messed up, Lois.

778
00:36:17,349 --> 00:36:18,828
- I know.

779
00:36:18,872 --> 00:36:20,830
I hope that I can
earn back your trust.

780
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,272
- What are you doing there?

781
00:36:27,315 --> 00:36:29,230
- I'm not alone.

782
00:36:29,274 --> 00:36:33,103
All this time I've been
without anyone of my kind,

783
00:36:33,147 --> 00:36:35,149
alone, Father,

784
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:37,064
for years.

785
00:36:37,107 --> 00:36:38,370
How could you not tell me?

786
00:36:38,413 --> 00:36:40,589
- He is
of no consequence to you.

787
00:36:40,633 --> 00:36:42,243
- He's from the house of El.
He's my--

788
00:36:42,287 --> 00:36:43,505
- He's your brother, yes,

789
00:36:43,549 --> 00:36:45,768
by bloodline only,

790
00:36:45,812 --> 00:36:48,336
a pathetic
treasonous bloodline.

791
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:50,251
- He's become a hero, Father.

792
00:36:50,295 --> 00:36:52,035
- He is nothing!

793
00:36:52,688 --> 00:36:56,170
- I'll find another way.
- You will do no such thing.

794
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:57,432
- When I find the Eradicator,

795
00:36:57,476 --> 00:36:59,913
I'll show him what we can do.
- Tal, no.

796
00:36:59,956 --> 00:37:01,306
- I'll make myself knownto him,

797
00:37:01,349 --> 00:37:03,438
give him what he's been here
without as well.

798
00:37:03,482 --> 00:37:04,961
- Tal, listen to me.

799
00:37:05,005 --> 00:37:07,660
- I don't need to do
this your way, Father.

800
00:37:07,703 --> 00:37:09,792
- You are going to ruin
the resurrection.

801
00:37:09,836 --> 00:37:12,447
- I'm not; I'm just not going
to die to do it!

802
00:37:12,491 --> 00:37:15,276
- My way is the only way!

803
00:37:18,453 --> 00:37:20,325
Tal, Tal?

804
00:37:20,368 --> 00:37:22,892
Tal, what are you doing?
No!

805
00:37:45,393 --> 00:37:48,527
- Your way is the only way.

806
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:50,659
Goodbye, Father.

807
00:38:05,108 --> 00:38:06,762
- I don't really know
what I'm supposed to say here.

808
00:38:06,806 --> 00:38:08,198
- You could start
with an apology.

809
00:38:08,242 --> 00:38:10,636
- I'm sorry
the cops got all aggro

810
00:38:10,679 --> 00:38:12,202
about us going to the lake.

811
00:38:12,246 --> 00:38:14,857
- You know,
forget the trespassing, Sarah.

812
00:38:14,901 --> 00:38:17,295
You ditched school.
That's unacceptable.

813
00:38:17,338 --> 00:38:20,820
- I'm supposed to sit in class
while people talk about me?

814
00:38:20,863 --> 00:38:22,212
About you?

815
00:38:22,256 --> 00:38:24,650
Everyone blames us about Edge,
and I'm over it, okay?

816
00:38:24,693 --> 00:38:26,434
So please just ground me.

817
00:38:26,478 --> 00:38:28,828
I'm not exactly dying to go out
there in this sad little town

818
00:38:28,871 --> 00:38:31,744
with these vindictive
closed-minded garbage people.

819
00:38:31,787 --> 00:38:35,400
- You know what?
Let's just call it a night.

820
00:38:35,443 --> 00:38:37,793
Start fresh tomorrow, okay?

821
00:38:37,837 --> 00:38:40,013
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

822
00:38:50,023 --> 00:38:51,372
Teenagers.

823
00:38:52,982 --> 00:38:55,202
- You should have seen the look

824
00:38:55,245 --> 00:38:57,378
on Mayor Dean's face.

825
00:38:57,422 --> 00:39:00,425
He knows he was wrong.

826
00:39:00,468 --> 00:39:03,732
- Yeah, well, he's got
to cover his own hide.

827
00:39:03,776 --> 00:39:06,387
- It's only gonna get worse,
isn't it?

828
00:39:12,393 --> 00:39:15,309
Maybe you're right, Kyle.

829
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:17,790
Maybe we just pack up

830
00:39:17,833 --> 00:39:21,359
and get as far away
from here as we can.

831
00:39:26,929 --> 00:39:29,932
- We're gonna be all right.

832
00:39:29,976 --> 00:39:32,413
- Do you have any idea
how much trouble you're in?

833
00:39:32,457 --> 00:39:34,110
You can't just skip school.

834
00:39:34,154 --> 00:39:36,243
I don't care if you're mooning
over Sarah Cushing

835
00:39:36,286 --> 00:39:38,419
or coming home to build robots
with John Henry.

836
00:39:38,463 --> 00:39:40,334
- Mooning?
- It's a warsuit.

837
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:41,944
- Look, guys,
you've been through a lot.

838
00:39:41,988 --> 00:39:43,859
You wanna blow off some steam,
I get it.

839
00:39:43,903 --> 00:39:47,385
But there are rules, and you
do not disrespect your teachers

840
00:39:47,428 --> 00:39:49,735
by ignoring the work
they put into your classes.

841
00:39:49,778 --> 00:39:52,215
- We're sorry.
- Really sorry.

842
00:39:52,999 --> 00:39:54,609
- You want to try saying that

843
00:39:54,653 --> 00:39:56,263
a little more convincingly,
please?

844
00:39:57,003 --> 00:39:59,919
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

845
00:39:59,962 --> 00:40:01,529
- Now things
are finally calming down,

846
00:40:01,573 --> 00:40:03,183
so when you're done
being grounded,

847
00:40:03,226 --> 00:40:05,446
you guys can go back
to being normal teenagers,

848
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:09,232
and believe me, small towns
are actually a lot of fun.

849
00:40:13,585 --> 00:40:16,501
- All right.
Go to bed. Now.

850
00:40:24,639 --> 00:40:27,860
What?

851
00:40:28,861 --> 00:40:30,906
- "Small towns
are a lot of fun."

852
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:33,256
- Just trying to give them
something to look forward to.

853
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:35,433
- Sounds vaguely provocative.
- Oh, does it?

854
00:40:35,476 --> 00:40:38,566
And you're still not sold
on the small towns?

855
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:40,873
- I'm sold
on my small town guy.

856
00:40:40,916 --> 00:40:43,223
- Hmm.
I can live with that.

857
00:40:49,621 --> 00:40:51,405
- How long ago did this start?

858
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:53,320
- A couple of minutes, sir.

859
00:40:55,583 --> 00:40:57,672
Send in a team to check it out.

860
00:41:17,692 --> 00:41:19,085
- His vitals?
- They're gone, sir.

861
00:41:19,128 --> 00:41:21,261
We're not registering anything.

862
00:41:28,355 --> 00:41:30,313
- Maximize that
kryptonite field.

863
00:41:47,592 --> 00:41:48,636
- Get them out of there.

864
00:42:34,856 --> 00:42:36,510
Edge.

865
00:43:05,887 --> 00:43:08,281
- He's gone.

866
00:43:08,324 --> 00:43:11,371
- Then where the hell
did he go?

867
00:43:23,731 --> 00:43:25,515
- You had one mission.

868
00:43:25,559 --> 00:43:27,213
- One mission.
- One mission.

869
00:43:27,256 --> 00:43:30,042
- And you veered from it
because you are weak.

870
00:43:30,085 --> 00:43:31,696
- Weak.
- Weak.

871
00:43:31,739 --> 00:43:33,654
- You shall not veer from it
any longer.

872
00:43:33,698 --> 00:43:36,309
Now go and complete
what you were sent here to do.

873
00:43:36,352 --> 00:43:38,528
- Become the Eradicator.
- Become the Eradicator.

874
00:43:38,572 --> 00:43:40,792
- Become the Eradicator.
- Become the Eradicator.

875
00:43:40,835 --> 00:43:43,664
- Become the Eradicator!

876
00:43:43,708 --> 00:43:46,841
- Or know that you
are the sole reason

877
00:43:46,885 --> 00:43:49,235
Krypton was lost.

878
00:44:20,396 --> 00:44:22,137
- Greg, move your head.

878
00:44:23,305 --> 00:45:23,240
