1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:02,760
<i>Previously on Travelers...</i>

2
00:00:02,762 --> 00:00:04,360
My team has been tasked

3
00:00:04,362 --> 00:00:05,861
to prevent the military from building

4
00:00:05,863 --> 00:00:07,830
the most powerful weapon
of mass destruction in history.

5
00:00:07,832 --> 00:00:10,566
We just saved 11,000 people.

6
00:00:10,568 --> 00:00:13,770
You know, a phone call to 911
could have saved his life.

7
00:00:13,772 --> 00:00:15,772
That's cold, Philip.

8
00:00:15,774 --> 00:00:17,473
<i>With just four dead...</i>

9
00:00:17,475 --> 00:00:19,142
How could you have possibly
known that was going to happen

10
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:20,909
<i>unless you had something
to do with it happening?</i>

11
00:00:20,911 --> 00:00:22,678
You've got a wife
you've got to go home to

12
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,212
and meet for the first time.

13
00:00:24,214 --> 00:00:25,480
- Where are you going?
- Out.

14
00:00:25,482 --> 00:00:26,514
With that guy?

15
00:00:31,521 --> 00:00:33,321
You know, we could've taken the bus.

16
00:00:33,323 --> 00:00:35,123
I need to improve my fitness.

17
00:00:35,124 --> 00:00:36,401
Fitness. Good.

18
00:00:36,426 --> 00:00:38,592
Been working out a little bit myself.

19
00:00:42,198 --> 00:00:45,099
You know, "Last Week Marcy" was chatty.

20
00:00:45,101 --> 00:00:46,801
Was she?

21
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:55,374
Okay, here's my theory.

22
00:00:55,376 --> 00:00:56,843
Tell me if I'm close.

23
00:00:56,845 --> 00:01:00,244
You've been undercover
with an FBI task force

24
00:01:00,285 --> 00:01:02,085
on some kind of mission this whole time.

25
00:01:02,087 --> 00:01:03,186
You needed a cover.

26
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:04,320
That's very close.

27
00:01:04,322 --> 00:01:05,755
Really?

28
00:01:05,757 --> 00:01:07,757
Hey, David, when we get to the hospital,

29
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:08,792
it's really important

30
00:01:08,794 --> 00:01:10,026
that you help me convince the doctor

31
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:11,327
to give me an MRI.

32
00:01:11,329 --> 00:01:12,787
You mean another MRI.

33
00:01:14,164 --> 00:01:15,060
What?

34
00:01:15,062 --> 00:01:16,699
Well, the other day,
when you had the seizure,

35
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:18,562
Dr. Lee ordered an MRI.

36
00:01:18,587 --> 00:01:20,669
Why didn't you tell me?

37
00:01:20,671 --> 00:01:22,671
Well, number one, you were unconscious.

38
00:01:22,673 --> 00:01:24,372
Number two,

39
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,141
I'm pretty sure that Last Week Marcy

40
00:01:27,144 --> 00:01:28,477
wouldn't know what an MRI was,

41
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,177
not to mention the fact
that you escaped the hospital

42
00:01:30,179 --> 00:01:31,512
like you were Papillon.

43
00:01:31,514 --> 00:01:33,081
You're certain that the MRI was done

44
00:01:33,083 --> 00:01:35,002
at the hospital that I woke up in?

45
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:37,103
Yeah, I was in the waiting room.

46
00:01:38,688 --> 00:01:39,721
Thank you.

47
00:01:39,723 --> 00:01:40,922
Uh, that's all I need!

48
00:01:40,924 --> 00:01:43,060
I'll see you back
at the apartment later.

49
00:01:45,294 --> 00:01:47,694
Wait! Marce, no, we had a deal!

50
00:01:51,767 --> 00:01:53,500
Ecclesiastes tells us

51
00:01:53,502 --> 00:01:55,836
that "There is a season for everything,

52
00:01:55,838 --> 00:01:58,705
"and a time for every event
under heaven...

53
00:01:59,282 --> 00:02:02,141
a time to be born, and a time to die... "

54
00:02:03,577 --> 00:02:04,610
For some of us,

55
00:02:04,612 --> 00:02:07,279
death comes at the end of a long life,

56
00:02:07,281 --> 00:02:09,849
but, for many of us,
as it did for Stephen,

57
00:02:09,851 --> 00:02:12,451
death is an unexpected visitor.

58
00:02:13,587 --> 00:02:15,688
Only God can cut the thread.

59
00:02:16,638 --> 00:02:20,191
We must trust in God's plan
for each one of us.

60
00:03:03,553 --> 00:03:05,510
How could you come here?

61
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:09,806
I thought it was important
to say how sorry I was.

62
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,045
How sorry I am.

63
00:03:19,142 --> 00:03:21,108
You were his best friend!

64
00:03:22,871 --> 00:03:24,419
Was I?

65
00:03:25,689 --> 00:03:27,984
Are you high right now?

66
00:03:28,691 --> 00:03:31,225
Did you come to my son's funeral high?

67
00:03:31,227 --> 00:03:32,893
Marion, it's not worth what you're...

68
00:03:32,895 --> 00:03:34,428
You were there!

69
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:36,296
The police told me!
You could've called 911!

70
00:03:36,298 --> 00:03:37,898
You could've saved him!

71
00:04:10,219 --> 00:04:17,782

Philip?

73
00:04:44,663 --> 00:04:46,729
Philip! It's time to go!

74
00:04:48,815 --> 00:04:50,299
Come on, man. Coordinates.

75
00:04:50,302 --> 00:04:52,502
I need to know where we're going.

76
00:04:59,129 --> 00:05:01,015
Did you just...?

77
00:05:01,578 --> 00:05:03,779
Yeah. Just a little. I had to.

78
00:05:04,132 --> 00:05:05,713
Are you gonna be able to work?

79
00:05:05,716 --> 00:05:07,582
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

80
00:05:10,353 --> 00:05:12,311
This should help.

81
00:05:12,622 --> 00:05:13,980
It's...

82
00:05:15,015 --> 00:05:16,724
Don't you want to know what that is?

83
00:05:16,726 --> 00:05:18,238
Whatever.

84
00:05:20,297 --> 00:05:21,495
Hey, when you have time,

85
00:05:21,497 --> 00:05:22,763
I need you to download

86
00:05:22,765 --> 00:05:24,532
this file from the hospital.

87
00:05:24,534 --> 00:05:26,504
Doctor's name's right there.

88
00:05:27,002 --> 00:05:28,601
And what kind of file is this?

89
00:05:28,603 --> 00:05:30,003
It's an MRI, actually.

90
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,906
Mine.

91
00:05:34,116 --> 00:05:35,582
Yeah, sure. Done.

92
00:05:35,811 --> 00:05:37,577
Okay. Everybody ready?

93
00:05:37,579 --> 00:05:39,185
Just need the where-to.

94
00:05:39,882 --> 00:05:44,984
33.2507 degrees by 74.1003 degrees.

95
00:05:44,986 --> 00:05:46,029
All right.

96
00:05:46,031 --> 00:05:47,786
The incoming traveler arrives at 21:33,

97
00:05:47,788 --> 00:05:49,421
and it's at least an hour away.

98
00:06:18,851 --> 00:06:19,950
Hey, are you...?

99
00:06:19,952 --> 00:06:21,986
Traveler 3468.

100
00:06:21,988 --> 00:06:23,754
Transition of
incoming Traveler canceled.

101
00:06:23,756 --> 00:06:24,922
Resume protocols.

102
00:06:32,365 --> 00:06:33,931
How did I get here?

103
00:06:33,933 --> 00:06:35,367
I don't know,

104
00:06:35,369 --> 00:06:36,766
but it's a little late
to be riding your bike.

105
00:06:36,768 --> 00:06:38,382
I'm not supposed to talk to strangers.

106
00:06:38,384 --> 00:06:39,468
Are you a policeman?

107
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:40,522
- No.
- Yes.

108
00:06:40,524 --> 00:06:41,938
Yes. Yes. And you should be at home.

109
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,406
You know the way?

110
00:06:55,352 --> 00:06:57,419
That was creepier than I imagined.

111
00:06:57,421 --> 00:06:59,788
Only pre-pubescent brains
are malleable enough

112
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:02,557
to receive and deliver messages
without damage.

113
00:07:02,559 --> 00:07:04,826
I know. Still creepy.

114
00:07:04,828 --> 00:07:06,828
The new traveler was supposed
to give us our next mission.

115
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:08,230
Well, plans change.

116
00:07:08,232 --> 00:07:09,630
You know, we could
still go to the T.E.L.L.

117
00:07:09,632 --> 00:07:12,075
and save the guy
from getting hit by a bus.

118
00:07:13,053 --> 00:07:14,534
That's what happens to the host...

119
00:07:14,537 --> 00:07:16,459
actually, now he's some poor guy,

120
00:07:16,461 --> 00:07:17,738
after 21:33.

121
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:20,808
Protocol 3, Philip. We can't interfere.

122
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:24,103
Two minutes ago,
we were interfering a lot.

123
00:07:24,981 --> 00:07:28,847
A traveler was going to
take over a man's life...

124
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:30,250
Because the Director

125
00:07:30,252 --> 00:07:31,818
had plans for the new traveler.

126
00:07:32,455 --> 00:07:34,519
The host was going to die either way.

127
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:37,790
Not "was going to". "Is".

128
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:39,926
It hasn't happened yet.

129
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:42,162
All we have to do is drive by and say,

130
00:07:42,164 --> 00:07:44,093
"Hey, man! Look out for the bus!"

131
00:07:44,463 --> 00:07:45,697
And he gets home to his wife tonight.

132
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:47,732
All right, Philip, that's enough.
You know better.

133
00:07:47,734 --> 00:07:49,601
Yeah...

134
00:07:49,603 --> 00:07:50,902
I know better.

135
00:07:59,613 --> 00:08:00,744
Mm-mm, no.

136
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:02,880
You are not leaving this house

137
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:04,048
wearing that tie again.

138
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,083
Why? Why?

139
00:08:05,085 --> 00:08:06,050
What's the matter with it?

140
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:07,251
Nothing's wrong with it,

141
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:09,153
but you've been wearing it
for three days.

142
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:12,090
Even on the weekend,
which is kind of weird.

143
00:08:12,092 --> 00:08:13,858
Please tell me you've been
changing your underwear.

144
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,527
Underwear... right.

145
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:18,061
Um, you know, I think...

146
00:08:18,063 --> 00:08:20,597
I think I might go tie-less today.

147
00:08:20,599 --> 00:08:21,598
You?

148
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,932
Well, if you do,

149
00:08:22,934 --> 00:08:24,201
make sure someone takes a picture,

150
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:26,769
'cause that'll be a first.

151
00:08:26,771 --> 00:08:28,505
I was thinking maybe we should

152
00:08:28,507 --> 00:08:30,907
try something vegan for dinner tonight.

153
00:08:30,909 --> 00:08:31,941
<i>Vegan?</i>

154
00:08:31,943 --> 00:08:33,076
Yeah, you know,

155
00:08:33,078 --> 00:08:35,144
food not sourced from
animals in any way.

156
00:08:35,146 --> 00:08:37,213
Yeah, babe, I know what vegan is,

157
00:08:37,215 --> 00:08:40,849
but you are my tie-wearing carnivore.

158
00:08:40,851 --> 00:08:42,684
Doesn't hurt to try new things.

159
00:08:42,686 --> 00:08:45,488
Ah, I kind of like the sound of that.

160
00:08:46,657 --> 00:08:48,124
But wear the tie.

161
00:09:36,395 --> 00:09:37,870
Have you tried this vegetable?

162
00:09:37,872 --> 00:09:39,038
Corn?

163
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,106
Mm-hmm!

164
00:09:40,521 --> 00:09:41,954
Yeah.

165
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:43,873
Mm-hmm.

166
00:09:45,079 --> 00:09:46,448
Mm...

167
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:48,146
Wrong table, bro.

168
00:09:48,148 --> 00:09:49,281
Hey, babe.

169
00:09:50,817 --> 00:09:53,218
Oh, my God. You okay?

170
00:09:54,588 --> 00:09:56,020
She broke my phone.

171
00:09:56,022 --> 00:09:58,204
I'm so sorry. Here. Let me help you up.

172
00:09:58,735 --> 00:10:02,503
It's okay. Come here.
I'll get your bag for you.

173
00:10:02,928 --> 00:10:05,196
<i>We're
getting a description now.</i>

174
00:10:05,198 --> 00:10:07,164
<i>Now it looks like
we've arrived at the area</i>

175
00:10:14,349 --> 00:10:16,506
- Workin' hard?
- Every day.

176
00:10:16,508 --> 00:10:18,174
We just got this security-camera footage

177
00:10:18,176 --> 00:10:20,243
from outside the library
the other night.

178
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:23,213
Two assaults, same assailants.

179
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,266
There's an interesting twist

180
00:10:25,268 --> 00:10:26,282
a few minutes in.

181
00:10:26,284 --> 00:10:27,817
What?

182
00:10:28,499 --> 00:10:30,052
You'll see.

183
00:11:39,654 --> 00:11:41,119
<i>At least two people are dead</i>

184
00:11:41,121 --> 00:11:42,654
<i>after the Madison Bridge</i>

185
00:11:42,656 --> 00:11:44,389
<i>suddenly collapsed early this morning.</i>

186
00:11:44,391 --> 00:11:45,856
...Emergency crews set up detours

187
00:11:45,858 --> 00:11:47,825
as they continue to search
for survivors.

188
00:11:47,827 --> 00:11:50,629
<i>...Continue
to search for survivors.</i>

189
00:11:50,631 --> 00:11:52,063
<i>And in other news,</i>

190
00:11:52,065 --> 00:11:53,064
<i>Florida is on high alert with...</i>

191
00:11:53,066 --> 00:11:54,365
Tropical storms.

192
00:11:54,367 --> 00:11:56,167
<i>...storm. Winds are gusting...</i>

193
00:12:58,847 --> 00:13:00,580
You got some explaining to do.

194
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:01,654
What?

195
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:02,840
Look, if you weren't gonna show,

196
00:13:02,842 --> 00:13:04,115
you could've at least let me know.

197
00:13:05,434 --> 00:13:06,864
Squash, Saturday morning.

198
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:08,611
Squash...

199
00:13:08,613 --> 00:13:10,045
You forgot, didn't you?

200
00:13:10,047 --> 00:13:12,463
Uh, s-sorry. How was it? Squash?

201
00:13:12,465 --> 00:13:13,376
You know,

202
00:13:13,378 --> 00:13:15,153
it's king of a hard game to play alone,

203
00:13:15,155 --> 00:13:16,893
but fortunately,
I found a playing partner

204
00:13:16,895 --> 00:13:18,287
who is actually a challenge.

205
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:22,220
Um, hey, did you change
the password here?

206
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:24,836
How many times did you punch it in?

207
00:13:24,838 --> 00:13:26,029
Twice.

208
00:13:26,032 --> 00:13:27,400
Well, we better get it
right the third time,

209
00:13:27,402 --> 00:13:29,308
or we're gonna be locked out.

210
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:31,587
What ever happened
with our cyber terrorist?

211
00:13:32,046 --> 00:13:33,446
Oh, uh, dead-end.

212
00:13:33,448 --> 00:13:34,947
Yeah, it was just a bunch of kids.

213
00:13:34,949 --> 00:13:37,122
You probably got the caps-lock on again.

214
00:13:41,455 --> 00:13:43,054
There!

215
00:13:44,067 --> 00:13:45,490
All right. It's time. Let's go.

216
00:13:46,115 --> 00:13:47,114
Where?

217
00:13:47,116 --> 00:13:49,013
It's Monday. Gun range?

218
00:13:49,015 --> 00:13:50,517
- Right!
- Right.

219
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:51,551
You okay?

220
00:13:51,553 --> 00:13:53,153
Absolutely.

221
00:13:53,155 --> 00:13:55,755
It's Monday. Let's shoot guns.

222
00:14:13,487 --> 00:14:14,619
Hey.

223
00:14:15,942 --> 00:14:17,942
I went shopping.

224
00:14:19,563 --> 00:14:20,896
Did you sleep?

225
00:14:20,898 --> 00:14:22,196
A little bit.

226
00:14:22,222 --> 00:14:23,629
Yeah?

227
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:24,653
Sit down, sit down.

228
00:14:24,678 --> 00:14:26,044
I'm fine.

229
00:14:29,773 --> 00:14:31,736
You're taking too large a dose.

230
00:14:32,175 --> 00:14:34,742
No more than eight units. A quarter up.

231
00:14:34,744 --> 00:14:35,967
Okay?

232
00:14:37,747 --> 00:14:39,379
Sterile water,

233
00:14:39,381 --> 00:14:41,582
alcoholic wipes, syringes.

234
00:14:41,584 --> 00:14:43,718
Used syringes in there.

235
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,752
Okay?

236
00:15:01,236 --> 00:15:03,603
We're not gonna save the world.

237
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:08,253
Why do you say that?

238
00:15:08,278 --> 00:15:09,710
'Cause it doesn't want to be saved.

239
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,310
So we'll save it anyway.

240
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:14,347
You know...

241
00:15:15,315 --> 00:15:16,749
depression

242
00:15:17,129 --> 00:15:19,717
is a side effect of heroin addiction.

243
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,243
I'm not depressed.

244
00:15:22,633 --> 00:15:24,655
Mm-hmm. We're just sitting here...

245
00:15:25,015 --> 00:15:27,591
waiting for orders from the future.

246
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:28,876
Protocol 5.

247
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:31,729
"Resume your host's life. "

248
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:35,800
My host is a junkie.

249
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:37,735
What about yours?

250
00:15:38,805 --> 00:15:40,403
We're talking about you right now.

251
00:15:40,405 --> 00:15:42,505
We could be doing so much more, Marcy.

252
00:15:42,507 --> 00:15:44,909
We're doing what we came here to do,

253
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:47,978
and we knew, going into this,
that we couldn't fix everything,

254
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:50,247
that we're not supposed to
fix everything,

255
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:51,410
and if we do,

256
00:15:51,412 --> 00:15:53,027
we could make it
worse without even knowing.

257
00:15:53,618 --> 00:15:54,835
I know.

258
00:15:55,683 --> 00:15:57,519
I know you know.

259
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:00,522
No more than eight units.

260
00:16:01,322 --> 00:16:02,491
Just enough to be functional.

261
00:16:02,493 --> 00:16:03,558
Any more than that,

262
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,660
I know it's 'cause you want it.

263
00:16:04,662 --> 00:16:06,862
I won't stand for that. Okay?

264
00:16:06,864 --> 00:16:07,897
See ya.

265
00:16:20,645 --> 00:16:22,232
People drop their phones all the time.

266
00:16:22,234 --> 00:16:23,299
She said you pushed her.

267
00:16:24,202 --> 00:16:26,227
I don't even know her.
Why would I push her?

268
00:16:26,354 --> 00:16:27,719
That's my question, Rene.

269
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:30,421
You know, phones break, not a big deal.

270
00:16:30,424 --> 00:16:32,557
What is a big deal is bullying.

271
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:34,559
You know, you make
your own choices, guys.

272
00:16:34,561 --> 00:16:37,254
For example, you could choose to be a...

273
00:16:37,502 --> 00:16:38,702
what's the word?

274
00:16:38,751 --> 00:16:39,716
Douchebag?

275
00:16:39,847 --> 00:16:41,266
That works. Or...

276
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:42,944
you could choose to be nicer

277
00:16:42,946 --> 00:16:45,185
to those who aren't as blessed
with popularity as you.

278
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:46,977
- It's not hard.
- I'm totally nice!

279
00:16:47,776 --> 00:16:49,092
I'm sorry. You're not.

280
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:51,376
What?

281
00:16:51,378 --> 00:16:54,052
Okay, you can contemplate
your choices in detention.

282
00:16:54,259 --> 00:16:55,512
Ms. Day...

283
00:16:55,953 --> 00:16:58,018
I apologize for my involvement in this,

284
00:16:58,389 --> 00:17:01,077
and I'd like to offer
to replace the girl's phone.

285
00:17:05,549 --> 00:17:07,516
I think she'll appreciate that.

286
00:17:07,623 --> 00:17:08,724
May I go?

287
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:09,759
Yes.

288
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:19,435
What is wrong with him?

289
00:17:21,005 --> 00:17:22,638
I don't know.

290
00:17:36,427 --> 00:17:37,985
Hey.

291
00:17:40,723 --> 00:17:42,590
Calculated Chaos.

292
00:17:42,592 --> 00:17:44,058
What's that?

293
00:17:44,673 --> 00:17:45,759
A horse.

294
00:17:45,761 --> 00:17:48,032
Put it all on "Calculated Chaos".

295
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,597
All of it?

296
00:17:51,145 --> 00:17:53,138
Keep 30% of the winnings.

297
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,969
Distribute the rest, 50/50

298
00:17:55,683 --> 00:17:57,187
to these addresses.

299
00:17:58,412 --> 00:18:00,740
Look, Phil, if you owe
some money to a dealer, I...

300
00:18:00,742 --> 00:18:02,442
It's not a dealer.

301
00:18:02,739 --> 00:18:04,443
It's Stephen's mom.

302
00:18:04,723 --> 00:18:06,011
And Gower's family.

303
00:18:06,443 --> 00:18:07,679
The cop?

304
00:18:07,682 --> 00:18:09,682
Why? What do you owe him?

305
00:18:11,819 --> 00:18:13,386
Huh?

306
00:18:13,388 --> 00:18:14,520
Hey, I'll give you

307
00:18:14,522 --> 00:18:16,235
some advice as your lawyer.

308
00:18:16,237 --> 00:18:17,667
You're not my lawyer.

309
00:18:17,669 --> 00:18:19,197
Okay, free advice anyway.

310
00:18:19,199 --> 00:18:21,509
Start throwing money at these people,

311
00:18:21,511 --> 00:18:23,227
it's not the brightest of ideas.

312
00:18:23,229 --> 00:18:24,753
Makes you look guilty.

313
00:18:24,755 --> 00:18:27,499
Make it anonymous.
Put it in their mailbox.

314
00:18:29,614 --> 00:18:31,736
I need you to do this for me.

315
00:18:37,923 --> 00:18:39,709
So, uh...

316
00:18:41,663 --> 00:18:43,114
I have a kid...

317
00:18:44,189 --> 00:18:45,883
who hates me.

318
00:18:46,437 --> 00:18:48,885
So you know what I do
for his 18th birthday?

319
00:18:49,501 --> 00:18:51,455
I buy him a car. New freakin' car.

320
00:18:51,457 --> 00:18:54,790
Well, newish. You know what he does?

321
00:18:55,951 --> 00:18:57,539
Doesn't take it?

322
00:18:57,541 --> 00:18:59,762
Oh, no, no, no, he took it,
'course he took it.

323
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:01,431
He's not stupid.

324
00:19:01,433 --> 00:19:03,900
- But still hates me.
- Make the bet.

325
00:19:04,781 --> 00:19:05,995
Drop off the money.

326
00:19:06,326 --> 00:19:07,803
Keep the change.

327
00:19:15,979 --> 00:19:18,883
So these anonymous tips started
coming in early this morning.

328
00:19:18,885 --> 00:19:20,368
One of them led to this whacko

329
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:22,556
planning on shooting up
this bank in San Fran later.

330
00:19:22,657 --> 00:19:24,023
Where are they coming from?

331
00:19:24,025 --> 00:19:26,725
Well, they're searching
the I.P. address now.

332
00:19:29,896 --> 00:19:32,831
Well, when it comes in,
we'll check it out.

333
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:41,765
Since when are you a perfect shot?

334
00:19:49,048 --> 00:19:50,939
So how long have you been
her social worker?

335
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:53,950
Uh... over a year.

336
00:19:54,053 --> 00:19:57,019
And when's the last time you saw Marcy?

337
00:19:59,157 --> 00:20:00,756
A few days ago.

338
00:20:01,078 --> 00:20:02,879
Hmm.

339
00:20:03,462 --> 00:20:05,028
I went by her apartment.

340
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:06,537
The building manager said
he hadn't seen her around.

341
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:07,583
I went by the library,

342
00:20:07,585 --> 00:20:08,831
same story.

343
00:20:09,401 --> 00:20:11,034
You have any idea where
she could be hiding?

344
00:20:12,504 --> 00:20:14,337
Hiding?

345
00:20:15,507 --> 00:20:16,639
What for?

346
00:20:16,641 --> 00:20:18,874
I don't know.

347
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:24,113
Well...

348
00:20:24,115 --> 00:20:25,570
if she does show up,
let her know I'd like

349
00:20:25,572 --> 00:20:27,145
to speak with her about
pressing charges.

350
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:28,749
She won't be pressing charges.

351
00:20:28,774 --> 00:20:31,299
But we have...

352
00:20:31,301 --> 00:20:32,754
...their faces.

353
00:20:32,756 --> 00:20:34,753
Yeah, she wants to move past this.

354
00:20:34,755 --> 00:20:36,391
Did she tell you that, David?

355
00:20:36,393 --> 00:20:38,136
Yeah, she did.

356
00:20:38,594 --> 00:20:39,960
Well, did she tell you

357
00:20:39,962 --> 00:20:42,122
that she kicked the shit
out of those boys?

358
00:20:45,601 --> 00:20:47,749
You knew she was capable of this?

359
00:20:48,838 --> 00:20:50,004
Hmm?

360
00:20:50,701 --> 00:20:53,407
Well, I-I think that, uh, when people

361
00:20:53,409 --> 00:20:55,342
are in fight-or-flight mode,
that they're capable of...

362
00:20:55,344 --> 00:20:57,657
"Fight-or-flight"?

363
00:20:57,659 --> 00:21:00,479
Yeah, it's instinct. People
either fight, or they...

364
00:21:01,417 --> 00:21:03,242
you know, fly.

365
00:21:03,267 --> 00:21:05,648
Has Marcy
been acting differently lately?

366
00:21:06,155 --> 00:21:08,955
Like a personality change?

367
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:13,848
No.

368
00:21:16,671 --> 00:21:18,070
Well, all right.

369
00:21:19,537 --> 00:21:21,767
Well, if you do notice anything,

370
00:21:21,769 --> 00:21:23,969
I'll leave my card.

371
00:21:25,673 --> 00:21:27,472
Hey, you hold on to those photos.

372
00:21:27,474 --> 00:21:29,707
Marcy might want to have to take a look.

373
00:21:45,307 --> 00:21:47,018
Thank you.

374
00:21:53,799 --> 00:21:56,025
This is not good, Marcy.

375
00:21:57,136 --> 00:21:59,980
He can't know you've been staying
here, not even for a few days.

376
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:02,503
It's completely inappropriate.

377
00:22:04,008 --> 00:22:06,574
I'm your social worker, for God's sake.

378
00:22:08,479 --> 00:22:09,881
So we don't tell anyone.

379
00:23:25,245 --> 00:23:27,044
Here's another one, Mac.

380
00:23:27,046 --> 00:23:29,146
An Islamic extremist in Chicago

381
00:23:29,148 --> 00:23:31,332
is planning on bombing
the train to O'Hare.

382
00:23:31,784 --> 00:23:32,741
They checked it out,

383
00:23:32,743 --> 00:23:34,318
the guy's apartment was full of I.E.D.s.

384
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,519
Really?

385
00:23:35,955 --> 00:23:39,289
And that, uh, I.P. address, that tip,

386
00:23:39,291 --> 00:23:41,224
is 10 minutes from here.

387
00:23:41,226 --> 00:23:42,726
Let's go check it out.

388
00:23:44,596 --> 00:23:46,730
It's my wife.

389
00:23:48,032 --> 00:23:49,266
Hey... Honey.

390
00:23:49,268 --> 00:23:50,634
I got a messenger.

391
00:23:50,636 --> 00:23:52,769
We have a mission.

392
00:23:52,771 --> 00:23:54,169
"Sweetie. "

393
00:23:54,171 --> 00:23:55,203
Tell her I said "hi. "

394
00:23:55,205 --> 00:23:56,238
Forbes says hi.

395
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,673
<i>Awkward.</i>

396
00:23:57,675 --> 00:23:59,241
She says hi back. What is... What is it?

397
00:23:59,243 --> 00:24:01,042
<i>We've got a mission. Now.</i>

398
00:24:01,044 --> 00:24:03,145
Okay, I'll meet you at... home?

399
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:05,481
Uh, Carly's.

400
00:24:05,483 --> 00:24:07,115
It's closer to where we need to be.

401
00:24:07,117 --> 00:24:08,818
<i>I'll be right there.</i>

402
00:24:10,654 --> 00:24:13,053
She's not feeling great, wants
me to take her to a doctor.

403
00:24:13,055 --> 00:24:14,054
Is it serious?

404
00:24:14,056 --> 00:24:15,777
I doubt it, but, you know.

405
00:24:15,779 --> 00:24:17,925
Yeah, of course, yeah, go.
Don't worry about it.

406
00:24:17,927 --> 00:24:20,060
I'll check out the address myself.
I'll call you later.

407
00:24:20,062 --> 00:24:21,128
Thanks.

408
00:24:25,724 --> 00:24:27,334
Hey!

409
00:24:27,798 --> 00:24:28,917
You don't think I'm nice?

410
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:30,483
Do you think you're nice?

411
00:24:31,775 --> 00:24:33,340
Well, I'm nice to you.

412
00:24:40,816 --> 00:24:42,148
<i>Trevor.</i>

413
00:24:45,252 --> 00:24:46,552
<i>Trevor?</i>

414
00:24:46,554 --> 00:24:48,153
Please stop.

415
00:24:48,579 --> 00:24:50,122
What is wrong with you?

416
00:24:52,109 --> 00:24:53,892
Are you even listening to me?

417
00:24:53,894 --> 00:24:55,628
Who's texting you?

418
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:57,763
Trevor! Who's texting you?

419
00:24:58,324 --> 00:24:59,632
I got to go.

420
00:25:07,607 --> 00:25:09,841
What's the message?

421
00:25:09,843 --> 00:25:12,610
Rescue an abducted boy
before he's murdered.

422
00:25:12,612 --> 00:25:13,812
That's it?

423
00:25:13,814 --> 00:25:15,796
I can't remember it verbatim.

424
00:25:15,798 --> 00:25:18,104
<i>You can't remember it verbatim?</i>

425
00:25:19,402 --> 00:25:20,517
Aleksander Andrieko.

426
00:25:21,126 --> 00:25:23,156
10-year-old Romanian immigrant.

427
00:25:23,158 --> 00:25:25,622
He went missing walking home
from school two months ago.

428
00:25:25,624 --> 00:25:26,890
Why save him?

429
00:25:26,892 --> 00:25:28,158
I assume he's important to the future.

430
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,760
I've never heard of him.

431
00:25:29,762 --> 00:25:30,894
Well, he's 10, so.

432
00:25:30,896 --> 00:25:33,320
The messenger didn't go into details.

433
00:25:33,322 --> 00:25:35,198
You can't exactly chat with them.

434
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,699
This one burst into tears and ran away

435
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:38,133
the second he delivered his message.

436
00:25:38,135 --> 00:25:39,736
Why did the messenger come to you?

437
00:25:41,773 --> 00:25:43,466
Oh, not you, you mean?

438
00:25:44,177 --> 00:25:45,742
I don't know, probably not a lot
of pre-pubescent children

439
00:25:45,744 --> 00:25:47,911
walking around an FBI office.

440
00:25:47,913 --> 00:25:49,545
Maybe it's time-sensitive.

441
00:25:49,547 --> 00:25:50,813
Why are you taking it so personally?

442
00:25:50,815 --> 00:25:52,114
I'm not taking it personally.

443
00:25:52,116 --> 00:25:54,249
Okay, what do we know
about the abductors?

444
00:25:54,251 --> 00:25:57,218
There are two of them. Man and a woman.

445
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:58,854
I know from historical records,

446
00:25:58,856 --> 00:26:01,256
the victim's body
was found in the basement.

447
00:26:01,471 --> 00:26:02,770
They're dangerous.

448
00:26:06,357 --> 00:26:07,829
You keep a gun in your diaper bag?

449
00:26:07,831 --> 00:26:09,897
Because I can't keep all of this...

450
00:26:16,739 --> 00:26:18,839
You've been shopping.

451
00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:21,045
A traveler team

452
00:26:21,047 --> 00:26:22,843
dropped off our armament
package yesterday.

453
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:25,379
You guys pick out what you want.

454
00:26:25,381 --> 00:26:28,448
I'm going to see
if my babysitter's home.

455
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:30,784
Hey. Hey, guys, w-we're saving a kid,

456
00:26:30,786 --> 00:26:32,419
not invading Normandy.

457
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:37,557
<i>You've reached
Special Agent MacLaren.</i>

458
00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:38,892
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

459
00:26:38,894 --> 00:26:40,527
Hey, partner, it's me.

460
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,729
The first address was an empty building,

461
00:26:42,731 --> 00:26:46,398
so our tipster's obviously
scrambling their I.P.

462
00:26:47,092 --> 00:26:49,968
We got it narrowed down
to a handful of local servers.

463
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:51,670
I'm going to go over my half of the list

464
00:26:51,672 --> 00:26:53,672
of possible addresses in the area

465
00:26:53,674 --> 00:26:54,940
and I will text you the other half,

466
00:26:54,942 --> 00:26:56,608
so we can cover more ground.

467
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:58,577
<i>Call me when you're done
at the doctor's.</i>

468
00:27:03,516 --> 00:27:04,615
Com-check.

469
00:27:04,617 --> 00:27:05,616
<i>Yeah, we're up.</i>

470
00:27:05,618 --> 00:27:07,452
Everybody clear on the plan?

471
00:27:07,454 --> 00:27:08,920
Trevor drops us off, we go in back.

472
00:27:08,922 --> 00:27:10,354
<i>Keep the engine running.</i>

473
00:27:10,356 --> 00:27:11,689
Will do.

474
00:27:11,691 --> 00:27:12,690
<i>Assume they're armed.</i>

475
00:28:03,006 --> 00:28:04,291
What do you think?

476
00:28:24,894 --> 00:28:26,961
<i>We've got
a vehicle approaching.</i>

477
00:28:28,426 --> 00:28:29,780
Yeah. We see 'em.

478
00:28:40,165 --> 00:28:41,774
Allan and Cathy Whiteman?

479
00:28:41,776 --> 00:28:43,775
Yeah, we are.

480
00:28:43,777 --> 00:28:46,678
FBI. How's your day going so far?

481
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,979
We'd just like to ask
you a few questions.

482
00:28:47,981 --> 00:28:49,514
FBI?

483
00:28:49,516 --> 00:28:51,516
Yes, ma'am.

484
00:28:53,386 --> 00:28:54,452
Do you mind if we come inside?

485
00:28:54,454 --> 00:28:55,921
Well, that's where we're going.

486
00:28:55,923 --> 00:28:57,856
Dammit, Cathy,
you'd better put that out.

487
00:28:57,858 --> 00:28:59,590
You don't want to get a fine
for smokin'.

488
00:28:59,592 --> 00:29:01,058
Aw, that's a whole other bureau.

489
00:29:02,127 --> 00:29:04,562
"Tobacco, Alcohol, and... "

490
00:29:04,564 --> 00:29:06,730
Never mind. Please.

491
00:29:13,297 --> 00:29:14,538
Sorry about the mess.

492
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:16,873
We don't get a lot of company.

493
00:29:36,833 --> 00:29:37,832
Come on.

494
00:29:59,782 --> 00:30:01,084
What is that smell?

495
00:30:01,818 --> 00:30:03,117
Chickens.

496
00:30:03,723 --> 00:30:04,752
In the house?

497
00:30:04,754 --> 00:30:05,786
No! 'Course not.

498
00:30:05,788 --> 00:30:07,421
The basement.

499
00:30:07,423 --> 00:30:08,688
We let 'em come and go.

500
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:10,123
You get used to it.

501
00:30:10,125 --> 00:30:11,457
How can we help you?

502
00:30:11,459 --> 00:30:14,628
We're investigating some suspicious
activity in the area...

503
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:16,462
Well, Glen and Shirley Duran,

504
00:30:16,464 --> 00:30:17,729
just south of us...

505
00:30:17,731 --> 00:30:20,767
and you didn't hear it from me...
they hire migrant workers.

506
00:30:20,769 --> 00:30:22,168
Cath!

507
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:23,503
Let 'em ask a damn question

508
00:30:23,505 --> 00:30:25,070
before you go hang the neighbors.

509
00:30:25,072 --> 00:30:26,972
<i>It's all right,
we're not here about them.</i>

510
00:30:26,974 --> 00:30:28,941
<i>Well, it ain't right.</i>

511
00:30:28,943 --> 00:30:31,143
<i>I mean, there's people
around here need jobs.</i>

512
00:31:30,141 --> 00:31:32,400
A boy who went missing two months ago

513
00:31:32,456 --> 00:31:33,822
was reported seen in the area,

514
00:31:33,847 --> 00:31:35,539
so we're checking with the locals.

515
00:31:35,599 --> 00:31:38,034
Do you know
anything about this?

516
00:31:38,036 --> 00:31:39,345
Haven't heard a thing.

517
00:31:39,347 --> 00:31:41,404
'Course we only go to town
for groceries.

518
00:31:42,407 --> 00:31:44,106
<i>Not in the house.</i>

519
00:31:44,108 --> 00:31:45,341
Sorry.

520
00:31:46,376 --> 00:31:47,675
I'm trying to quit,

521
00:31:47,677 --> 00:31:51,212
I am, but I-it's so damn hard, you know?

522
00:31:51,214 --> 00:31:53,415
I wonder if
your son has heard anything?

523
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:56,184
I noticed his sneakers
in the front hall.

524
00:31:56,186 --> 00:31:57,452
Oh, uh...

525
00:31:57,777 --> 00:31:59,620
I don't think he'd know anything.

526
00:32:00,169 --> 00:32:01,424
Probably not.

527
00:32:01,425 --> 00:32:03,457
I'd still like to ask him, though.

528
00:32:07,809 --> 00:32:09,476
All right.

529
00:32:15,237 --> 00:32:16,236
Patrick!

530
00:32:25,113 --> 00:32:27,361
<i>Philip,
slow down, we're making noise.</i>

531
00:32:28,616 --> 00:32:30,116
<i>Patrick!</i>

532
00:32:31,286 --> 00:32:33,119
Patrick!

533
00:32:35,223 --> 00:32:36,523
Patrick!

534
00:32:47,801 --> 00:32:49,234
Oh, shit.

535
00:32:56,604 --> 00:32:57,890
We found a body.

536
00:33:03,955 --> 00:33:05,682
<i>A child, maybe 10 years old.</i>

537
00:33:07,686 --> 00:33:09,487
I'll, uh, I'll just go and see...

538
00:33:10,984 --> 00:33:12,078
Ah...

539
00:33:26,471 --> 00:33:29,804
This man would like to ask you
some questions, Patrick.

540
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:32,919
Hi, Patrick.

541
00:33:33,544 --> 00:33:34,709
I'm with the FBI.

542
00:33:34,711 --> 00:33:36,245
Do you know what that means?

543
00:33:36,247 --> 00:33:37,746
A policeman?

544
00:33:37,748 --> 00:33:39,348
That's exactly right, yes.

545
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,815
What school do you go to?

546
00:33:40,817 --> 00:33:42,117
I don't go to school.

547
00:33:42,119 --> 00:33:43,652
We homeschool him.

548
00:33:44,821 --> 00:33:46,120
Nothing wrong with that.

549
00:33:46,122 --> 00:33:48,289
Gets a good Christian education.

550
00:33:48,291 --> 00:33:49,680
I'll bet he does.

551
00:33:57,733 --> 00:33:59,267
No.

552
00:33:59,269 --> 00:34:01,269
What are you saying to him?

553
00:34:04,339 --> 00:34:05,338
No.

554
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:06,639
Allan!

555
00:34:06,641 --> 00:34:09,409
Traveler 3468,

556
00:34:09,411 --> 00:34:11,878
you are off-mission. Abort immediately.

557
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,213
What the hell's going on?

558
00:34:13,215 --> 00:34:14,481
We're leaving.

559
00:34:14,483 --> 00:34:15,582
We are not leaving him!

560
00:34:15,584 --> 00:34:16,849
Stand down!

561
00:34:16,851 --> 00:34:19,418
There's one child dead already!
He's next.

562
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:20,719
And another three children after that.

563
00:34:20,721 --> 00:34:22,588
We are preventing this!

564
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:23,589
We're off-mission!

565
00:34:23,591 --> 00:34:25,157
<i>Stand down!</i>

566
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:26,225
We're not leaving him.

567
00:34:26,227 --> 00:34:27,759
He's our son!

568
00:34:51,485 --> 00:34:52,950
Philip!

569
00:34:52,952 --> 00:34:54,440
You're okay.

570
00:35:03,262 --> 00:35:04,894
We need to clean up Philip's blood!

571
00:35:04,896 --> 00:35:06,230
I'm on it, I'm on it.

572
00:35:06,232 --> 00:35:09,199
Trevor, get everybody
out of here and back to Ops.

573
00:35:09,201 --> 00:35:11,900
Okay. I got him. I got him, I got him.

574
00:35:17,942 --> 00:35:20,896
Aleksander, are you hurt at all?

575
00:35:21,553 --> 00:35:22,719
Are there any other kids here?

576
00:35:22,847 --> 00:35:24,247
Just me.

577
00:35:24,249 --> 00:35:25,348
Okay.

578
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:27,349
I'm going to get you home to your mom,

579
00:35:27,351 --> 00:35:28,350
but I need you

580
00:35:28,352 --> 00:35:29,717
to do something very important for me.

581
00:35:29,719 --> 00:35:31,253
Okay?

582
00:35:31,255 --> 00:35:32,654
Police officers will be here soon.

583
00:35:32,656 --> 00:35:34,322
They're gonna ask you what happened.

584
00:35:34,324 --> 00:35:35,723
It's really important you tell them

585
00:35:35,725 --> 00:35:37,725
I was the only person here.

586
00:35:38,503 --> 00:35:39,995
Okay?

587
00:35:39,996 --> 00:35:41,229
You asked me for help.

588
00:35:41,231 --> 00:35:42,730
They got afraid and started shooting.

589
00:35:42,732 --> 00:35:44,167
You understand?

590
00:35:46,302 --> 00:35:47,568
That's what happened.

591
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:49,303
Right?

592
00:35:49,305 --> 00:35:50,504
Yes.

593
00:35:51,574 --> 00:35:52,973
Good.

594
00:36:01,883 --> 00:36:03,883
Forbes?

595
00:36:13,317 --> 00:36:15,416
You should've called for backup.

596
00:36:15,418 --> 00:36:18,122
It was supposed to be
a routine I.P. address check.

597
00:36:18,175 --> 00:36:19,842
Got out of hand real fast.

598
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:21,944
So our vigilante's fake I.P. addresses

599
00:36:21,946 --> 00:36:23,813
led us to these abductors?

600
00:36:23,815 --> 00:36:25,080
That's a crazy coincidence.

601
00:36:25,082 --> 00:36:27,182
Unless he wanted us here.

602
00:36:27,184 --> 00:36:29,185
Another tip, if you think about it.

603
00:36:29,844 --> 00:36:32,119
So how does one person have
all this information?

604
00:36:32,121 --> 00:36:33,688
Explain that.

605
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:34,989
I can't.

606
00:36:40,407 --> 00:36:41,640
At least the boy's okay.

607
00:36:41,642 --> 00:36:42,641
Yeah.

608
00:36:42,643 --> 00:36:43,942
You get my message?

609
00:36:43,944 --> 00:36:45,277
Been a little busy.

610
00:36:45,279 --> 00:36:46,378
Yeah.

611
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:48,480
I was just starting
on your half of the list

612
00:36:48,482 --> 00:36:49,647
when you called.

613
00:36:49,649 --> 00:36:51,315
Yeah? Where's that?

614
00:36:51,317 --> 00:36:53,250
Old garage, downtown.

615
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:54,812
Fourth and Millwood.

616
00:36:56,022 --> 00:36:57,254
I'll, uh, check that out

617
00:36:57,256 --> 00:36:58,556
on my... on my way home.

618
00:36:58,558 --> 00:36:59,657
You sure?

619
00:36:59,659 --> 00:37:01,258
Yeah, yeah, you go. I got it covered.

620
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,393
All right.

621
00:37:02,395 --> 00:37:04,528
Oh, um... how's Kathryn?

622
00:37:04,932 --> 00:37:06,029
Hmm?

623
00:37:06,031 --> 00:37:07,530
She went to the doctor's?

624
00:37:07,828 --> 00:37:10,266
Oh. Yeah. She's... She's fine.

625
00:37:10,268 --> 00:37:11,556
All right.

626
00:37:30,588 --> 00:37:32,500
It's okay. Come here.

627
00:37:32,525 --> 00:37:33,562
The Director doesn't know.

628
00:37:33,589 --> 00:37:35,788
- What?
- What it's like.

629
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:37,924
Ah! Ah!

630
00:37:37,926 --> 00:37:39,691
- It's okay.
- Okay.

631
00:37:39,693 --> 00:37:40,859
Is he gonna be okay?

632
00:37:40,861 --> 00:37:42,495
Hold him still.

633
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:44,679
I got him.

634
00:37:45,099 --> 00:37:47,500
Trevor. Door.

635
00:37:47,502 --> 00:37:49,001
Hold on!

636
00:37:55,042 --> 00:37:57,542
You're going to be okay.
You're going to be okay.

637
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,013
Hold him still!

638
00:38:23,062 --> 00:38:25,062
Carly, lift his shirt up.

639
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:34,706
Okay. Apply pressure there.

640
00:38:34,708 --> 00:38:35,947
Okay.

641
00:38:47,702 --> 00:38:48,990
Whoa, Philip...

642
00:39:04,674 --> 00:39:06,773
<i>10-year-old
Aleksander Andrieko,</i>

643
00:39:06,775 --> 00:39:08,475
<i>abducted two months ago,</i>

644
00:39:08,477 --> 00:39:10,944
<i>was today found by the FBI</i>

645
00:39:10,946 --> 00:39:13,146
<i>and reunited with his grateful mother.</i>

646
00:39:13,148 --> 00:39:14,915
<i>Authorities say
his abductors were killed</i>

647
00:39:14,917 --> 00:39:17,551
<i>in an exchange of gunfire
with FBI Special Agent...</i>

648
00:39:17,553 --> 00:39:19,620
Do you guys wanna head out?

649
00:39:19,622 --> 00:39:21,487
We're not going anywhere.

650
00:39:25,304 --> 00:39:26,659
There was no messenger.

651
00:39:27,762 --> 00:39:29,028
No.

652
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:30,830
You've been sending tips to the FBI.

653
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,099
Yeah.

654
00:39:33,101 --> 00:39:35,823
Jesus, I don't even know
if I can cover this up.

655
00:39:36,571 --> 00:39:39,504
We have all of this knowledge
and we do nothing.

656
00:39:41,129 --> 00:39:42,974
What is this?

657
00:39:42,976 --> 00:39:44,142
Deaths.

658
00:39:44,911 --> 00:39:46,177
I've memorized all of it.

659
00:39:46,832 --> 00:39:48,653
Why can't we prevent some of it?

660
00:39:48,655 --> 00:39:49,881
Because there are rules!

661
00:39:50,874 --> 00:39:52,016
"Don't take a life"...

662
00:39:52,018 --> 00:39:53,184
I get.

663
00:39:53,704 --> 00:39:54,886
But what's wrong with saving one?

664
00:39:54,888 --> 00:39:55,886
An innocent kid?

665
00:39:55,888 --> 00:39:56,887
You can't tell me

666
00:39:56,889 --> 00:39:58,453
we didn't just do a good thing!

667
00:39:58,455 --> 00:39:59,770
It's not up to us!

668
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:00,791
A boy almost died.

669
00:40:00,793 --> 00:40:01,825
Yeah! I know that!

670
00:40:01,827 --> 00:40:02,993
And we saved him.

671
00:40:02,995 --> 00:40:04,371
I'm not ashamed of that.

672
00:40:04,373 --> 00:40:06,130
We don't get to decide.

673
00:40:06,132 --> 00:40:07,598
Every change we make

674
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,767
has the potential to alter the future.

675
00:40:09,769 --> 00:40:11,769
Isn't that what we're here to do?

676
00:40:11,771 --> 00:40:14,497
The FBI found you in one day, Philip!

677
00:40:14,499 --> 00:40:16,470
One day! Because you
think you know better

678
00:40:16,472 --> 00:40:18,207
- than the Director.
- The Director.

679
00:40:18,209 --> 00:40:20,744
Who the hell do you think you are?

680
00:40:24,268 --> 00:40:25,500
Nobody.

681
00:40:27,289 --> 00:40:28,922
I don't think I have any other choice.

682
00:40:28,924 --> 00:40:30,256
He's addicted to heroin.

683
00:40:30,258 --> 00:40:31,623
He's what?

684
00:40:33,572 --> 00:40:35,613
He inherited it from his host.

685
00:40:35,615 --> 00:40:38,450
Why would the Director put you
in the body of a heroin addict?

686
00:40:38,452 --> 00:40:39,818
The historical record

687
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:42,687
said that he died after
the first time that he used.

688
00:40:43,576 --> 00:40:46,310
His parents were probably in denial.

689
00:40:46,335 --> 00:40:47,400
We were trying to manage it,

690
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:50,161
and I-I thought it was under control.

691
00:40:51,797 --> 00:40:53,364
It's so hard.

692
00:40:54,367 --> 00:40:56,633
Yeah. I'll bet.

693
00:40:58,204 --> 00:40:59,403
Who else knew?

694
00:41:01,941 --> 00:41:03,707
Just me.

695
00:41:03,709 --> 00:41:06,276
You can manage this? Wean him off it?

696
00:41:07,579 --> 00:41:09,412
In time, yes.

697
00:41:11,549 --> 00:41:13,021
Well...

698
00:41:13,885 --> 00:41:16,286
Time, I know something about.

699
00:42:30,524 --> 00:42:32,917
Don't you have a test
in the morning, or something?

700
00:42:32,919 --> 00:42:36,159
Yeah, but I don't got to
study for this one.

701
00:42:36,863 --> 00:42:38,091
It's history.

702
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:41,599
Here.

703
00:42:43,002 --> 00:42:46,770
I've developed a new appetite for life.

704
00:42:48,126 --> 00:42:50,626
You just inhale the intoxicating aroma.

705
00:42:53,979 --> 00:42:55,312
Meat?

706
00:42:56,042 --> 00:42:57,914
Oh... it's ground meat.

707
00:42:58,917 --> 00:43:01,284
You know they don't actually
grow that in the ground, right?

708
00:43:01,309 --> 00:43:03,075
I'm not asking any questions.

709
00:43:03,455 --> 00:43:05,988
I'm embracing the 21st century.

710
00:43:07,525 --> 00:43:09,016
Save it for later.

711
00:43:09,954 --> 00:43:11,568
This you want.

712
00:43:20,036 --> 00:43:21,603
Mm!

713
00:43:27,416 --> 00:43:28,449
So...

714
00:43:29,646 --> 00:43:32,581
This is the list of
potential host candidates?

715
00:43:33,589 --> 00:43:34,622
Yeah.

716
00:43:34,647 --> 00:43:36,343
Not all of them, obviously.

717
00:43:44,594 --> 00:43:46,827
Then all these people are gonna die?

718
00:43:48,331 --> 00:43:49,455
Yeah.

719
00:43:50,879 --> 00:43:52,145
Why? What's wrong?

720
00:43:57,458 --> 00:43:59,458
I know this person.

Detective Maggie Sawyer...

736
00:45:15,246 --> 00:45:16,778
I think we made a pretty good team.

737
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:17,779
Yeah, I guess we did.

738
00:45:19,349 --> 00:45:20,915
<i>What the hell is this place?</i>

739
00:45:20,917 --> 00:45:24,151
Place for off-world'ers
to hang out, have a drink.

740
00:45:24,153 --> 00:45:26,287
- Who are you?
- My name is M'gann M'orzz.

741
00:45:26,289 --> 00:45:28,122
I am the last daughter of Mars.

742
00:45:28,124 --> 00:45:29,957
So our mystery
alien is from Daxam.

743
00:45:29,959 --> 00:45:31,392
It's a sister world to Krypton.

744
00:45:31,394 --> 00:45:33,728
My name is Mon-El. Can you help me
get in touch with my home world?

745
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:35,930
Daxam is still there,
but it's a wasteland.

746
00:45:49,878 --> 00:45:51,311
My prince, you can't stay here.

747
00:45:53,514 --> 00:45:54,747
Come on!

748
00:46:06,227 --> 00:46:07,593
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

749
00:46:08,596 --> 00:46:10,595
This is a Kryptonian ship.

750
00:46:10,597 --> 00:46:11,730
The emissaries?

751
00:46:11,732 --> 00:46:12,930
Dead.

752
00:46:12,932 --> 00:46:13,965
And so is their planet.

753
00:46:15,535 --> 00:46:17,135
All of this is Krypton's doing.

754
00:46:17,137 --> 00:46:18,637
We need to get you out of here.

755
00:46:18,639 --> 00:46:20,905
I can't fly one of these.

756
00:46:20,907 --> 00:46:22,374
Can you program the destination?

757
00:46:22,376 --> 00:46:23,375
Yes.

758
00:46:26,813 --> 00:46:28,044
Launch countdown started.

759
00:46:31,484 --> 00:46:34,718
And let me make your
costume and name you,

760
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:37,421
that I'm just going to
let you out of the DEO.

761
00:46:37,423 --> 00:46:41,158
That hadn't even crossed my mind.

762
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:42,493
Uh-huh.

763
00:46:42,495 --> 00:46:44,394
Us just sneaking out for a little bit,

764
00:46:44,396 --> 00:46:47,096
you know, just two new
friends, right, running a...

765
00:46:47,098 --> 00:46:49,865
Running a couple of field tests,

766
00:46:49,867 --> 00:46:52,001
living out our dreams,

767
00:46:52,003 --> 00:46:53,869
not getting in trouble.

768
00:46:53,871 --> 00:46:56,906
Hmm. Not bad.

769
00:46:56,908 --> 00:46:59,875
Damn you, Mon-El of Daxam.

770
00:46:59,877 --> 00:47:01,177
I'm so weak.

771
00:47:01,179 --> 00:47:02,644
Hey, chief, I got something for you.

772
00:47:02,646 --> 00:47:04,979
Remember the NCPD alien murder?

773
00:47:04,981 --> 00:47:07,683
A two-line police blotter item
does not constitute a story.

774
00:47:07,685 --> 00:47:10,585
It does when it's connected
to an underground fight club.

775
00:47:11,988 --> 00:47:14,623
My silence is your invitation.
Talk fast.

776
00:47:14,625 --> 00:47:20,060
Uh... Uh, the patron list is full of
prominent high rollers in National City.

777
00:47:20,062 --> 00:47:21,094
Great.

778
00:47:22,898 --> 00:47:25,433
Who's your source?

779
00:47:25,435 --> 00:47:27,802
I'm gonna have to come back
to you with that one.

780
00:47:27,804 --> 00:47:29,503
You don't even have an anonymous source?

781
00:47:29,505 --> 00:47:30,971
Someone who can talk off the record?

782
00:47:30,973 --> 00:47:32,306
No, uh, not yet.

783
00:47:32,308 --> 00:47:34,675
But I promise you, this is real.

784
00:47:34,677 --> 00:47:37,644
It's not real until you can
verify your sources.

785
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:40,613
We're the fourth estate, not Reddit.

786
00:47:54,027 --> 00:47:55,126
No, no, no!

787
00:47:55,128 --> 00:47:57,162
No, you said that we were
gonna test your powers.

788
00:47:57,164 --> 00:47:59,765
Yeah, yeah, we will, we will.
After this.

789
00:47:59,767 --> 00:48:01,299
Argh...

790
00:48:01,301 --> 00:48:04,436
Winn, for a Daxamite, it is the
height of insult to refuse a toast.

791
00:48:06,774 --> 00:48:09,607
Well, I wouldn't want to be
culturally insensitive.

792
00:48:09,609 --> 00:48:11,576
One drink.

793
00:48:11,578 --> 00:48:13,544
Drink! Drink! Drink!

794
00:48:18,284 --> 00:48:19,384
Oh!

795
00:48:21,354 --> 00:48:22,854
Up! Up! Up!

796
00:48:36,668 --> 00:48:38,735
...bending the right way.

797
00:48:40,873 --> 00:48:42,171
- Time to go.
- I... I didn't...

798
00:48:51,582 --> 00:48:54,116
- Come on in.
- You lied to me.

799
00:48:54,118 --> 00:48:56,084
I know about the fights, M'gann.

800
00:48:56,086 --> 00:48:57,887
I never lied to you. You never asked.

801
00:48:57,889 --> 00:48:59,354
Don't give me that.

802
00:48:59,356 --> 00:49:02,256
That's the real reason why you
didn't want to take the bond.

803
00:49:02,258 --> 00:49:04,058
Because then I'd know how
you were spending your nights.

804
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:06,093
How I spend my nights is no
one's business but my own.

805
00:49:06,095 --> 00:49:07,261
- Who runs the fights?
- Why?

806
00:49:07,263 --> 00:49:08,630
So I can stop them!

807
00:49:08,632 --> 00:49:11,766
You don't know
who you'd be going up against.

808
00:49:11,768 --> 00:49:13,902
She has powerful friends.

809
00:49:13,904 --> 00:49:14,903
So do I.

810
00:49:16,573 --> 00:49:17,671
They're using you.

811
00:49:17,673 --> 00:49:18,806
Watching you fight like an animal.

812
00:49:18,808 --> 00:49:21,708
No, I don't fight for them.
I fight for myself.

813
00:49:21,710 --> 00:49:23,977
This is the reality that we live in.

814
00:49:23,979 --> 00:49:25,779
This is the world you've created.

815
00:49:25,781 --> 00:49:27,748
So, what's in it for you? The money?

816
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:29,583
The thrill of the kill?

817
00:49:31,153 --> 00:49:33,654
I have never killed anyone in the ring.

818
00:49:33,656 --> 00:49:35,888
- You don't understand.
- Then make me understand!

819
00:49:37,258 --> 00:49:39,892
We're the last of our kind.
There's no one else.

820
00:49:39,894 --> 00:49:42,628
It's our responsibility to
preserve everything we've lost.

821
00:49:42,630 --> 00:49:46,031
That's the difference between us.
I don't want to remember.

822
00:49:46,033 --> 00:49:47,533
You want to still be there.

823
00:49:47,535 --> 00:49:50,470
You want to relive it,
over and over. I don't!

824
00:49:50,472 --> 00:49:51,603
I wanna forget.

825
00:49:51,605 --> 00:49:54,138
I will never forget
my wife and daughters.

826
00:49:54,140 --> 00:49:54,473
They're dead.
