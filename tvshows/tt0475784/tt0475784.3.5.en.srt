367
00:29:28,168 --> 00:29:31,293
Humanity's story
had been improvised.

368
00:29:31,376 --> 00:29:33,543
Now, it was planned

369

370
00:29:36,084 --> 00:29:39,501
For a time,
the sun and moon aligned.

371
00:29:39,585 --> 00:29:42,043
We brought order from chaos.

372

And then, as with all
the best laid plans,

373
00:29:46,168 --> 00:29:48,043
it began to fall apart.

374
00:29:48,126 --> 00:29:49,585
Dempsey became greedy,

375
00:29:49,668 --> 00:29:52,168
drove outcomes
to benefit himself.

376
00:29:52,251 --> 00:29:54,168
So we locked him out
of the system.

377
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:57,710
But there was a bigger problem.

378
00:29:58,835 --> 00:30:01,627
In every projection,
the world came unglued.

379

There were people,

who you couldn't predict
or control.

And I realized that my brother
was one of them.

He didn't fit
the world anymore,
