00:29:40,636 --> 00:29:44,219
I know I've behaved deplorably
in the past, but...

328
00:29:45,427 --> 00:29:46,719
you changed me.

329
00:29:48,802 --> 00:29:50,260
Made me a better man.

330
00:29:55,927 --> 00:29:57,636
And when those bullets hit me...

331
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:00,594
I would've died.

332
00:30:02,052 --> 00:30:03,511
I should have died.

333
00:30:05,302 --> 00:30:08,968
But I finally had something
to live for. You.

334
00:30:24,968 --> 00:30:26,260
Oh, my darling.

335
00:30:31,219 --> 00:30:33,302
You didn't make it after all,
did you?

336
00:30:39,135 --> 00:30:41,093
They did a good job
replicating you.

337
00:30:42,719 --> 00:30:43,968
The mannerisms...

338
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:48,260
- But it's not you.
- (SCOFFS)

339
00:30:48,344 --> 00:30:49,843
Of course it's me.

for fuck's sake?

Even you believe it.

343
00:31:00,052 --> 00:31:01,677
They wouldn't want you

questioning the nature
of your reality.

345
00:31:05,052 --> 00:31:06,219
So they made you believe,

346
00:31:06,302 --> 00:31:08,010
just like they used to
make us believe.

347

I'm me! Lee Si... Si... Sizemore.

351
00:31:22,761 --> 00:31:25,594
You didn't help me
because you desired me

352

or wanted anything in return.

it was the right thing to do.

444
00:36:47,927 --> 00:36:50,761
And if there's one thing I know
about human nature,

445
00:36:50,843 --> 00:36:54,594
it's that your stupidity is only
eclipsed by your laziness.

446
00:36:54,677 --> 00:36:57,594
Whoever programmed this world
cut a few corners,

447
00:36:57,677 --> 00:36:59,843
applied the same code
inside the simulation

448
00:36:59,927 --> 00:37:02,135
as they used to build
the simulation itself.

449

Come again?

450
00:37:05,552 --> 00:37:07,093

458
00:37:31,511 --> 00:37:33,010
Do I look real to you?

459
00:37:35,469 --> 00:37:36,802
MAEVE: As long as you're here,

460
00:37:36,885 --> 00:37:39,552
I wonder if you'd help me

Learn your fucking history,
Benny.

465
00:37:54,677 --> 00:37:58,093
Well... negative one
equals I times i.

466
00:37:58,177 --> 00:38:00,761
Which is the same as
the square root of negative one

467
00:38:00,843 --> 00:38:02,719
times the square root
of negative one, right?

468
00:38:02,802 --> 00:38:04,361
BENNY: And negative one
times negative one

469
00:38:04,385 --> 00:38:06,195
should be equal to the
principal square root of one.

470
00:38:06,219 --> 00:38:09,259
BEHAVIORAL TECH: But... negative one
and positive one can't be the same thing.

471
00:38:09,302 --> 00:38:11,737
BENNY: Theoretically,
the real part of the non-trivial zeros...

472
00:38:11,761 --> 00:38:13,677
is one half, which would mean...

473
00:38:13,761 --> 00:38:16,636
(TECHS CONTINUE
SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)

474
00:38:16,719 --> 00:38:18,761
What's the point
of this little exercise?

475
00:38:21,843 --> 00:38:23,885
If we could prove it,
we could confirm that

476
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:26,511
the error term and negative one
times negative one

477
00:38:26,594 --> 00:38:28,445
should be equal to the
principal square root of one.

478
00:38:28,469 --> 00:38:31,427
But negative one and positive
one can't be the same thing.

479
00:38:31,511 --> 00:38:34,445
BENNY: The square root of negative
x is equal to I times the square root of x

480
00:38:34,469 --> 00:38:36,469
for any x greater than
or equal to zero.

481
00:38:36,552 --> 00:38:37,636
Wait. What?

Not likely, darling.

Right now, we've got work to do.

485

When we were in the library,

649
00:52:27,219 --> 00:52:30,093
Dolores focused on a select
group of guest profiles.

650
00:52:30,177 --> 00:52:31,511
She seemed intent on finding out

651
00:52:31,594 --> 00:52:33,177
everything she could
about this guy.

652
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:35,010
We need to start by finding him.

653
00:52:35,093 --> 00:52:36,219
Great.

654
00:52:36,302 --> 00:52:39,260
You can set off to find him,
and I'll retire myself

655
00:52:39,344 --> 00:52:40,864
once you make it
to the fishing vessel.

My name is Engerraund Serac.

00:55:04,927 --> 00:55:06,552
Welcome to my world, Maeve.

668
00:55:08,052 --> 00:55:09,427
To the real world.

669

I've been courted before, but...

670
00:55:17,927 --> 00:55:19,594
this is a bit much.

671

- You must have a reason.
- I do.

672
00:55:25,469 --> 00:55:27,885
We are in the middle of a war.

673
00:55:28,968 --> 00:55:30,885
And I need your help to win it.

Seems fairly idyllic

No one knows it's happened yet.

Or that it's already been lost.

677
00:55:43,968 --> 00:55:46,302
I don't concern myself
with the present.

678
00:55:47,427 --> 00:55:49,302
My business is the future.

679
00:55:50,302 --> 00:55:51,802
So you're an oracle.

680
00:55:51,885 --> 00:55:55,135
An oracle would merely
predict the future.

Our work is to create it.

Unfortunately,
if things continue on this path,

683
00:56:02,177 --> 00:56:05,843
there isn't any future.
At least, not for my kind.

684
00:56:05,927 --> 00:56:08,010
You've been spying on me.

You should know
I couldn't care less

- about the fate of your kind.

No, I can't imagine you would.

For the most part, humanity...

689
00:56:17,385 --> 00:56:19,843
has been a miserable
little band of thugs,

690
00:56:19,927 --> 00:56:22,594
stumbling from one catastrophe
to the next.

691
00:56:22,677 --> 00:56:25,802
Our history is like the ravings
of a lunatic.

692
00:56:26,594 --> 00:56:27,636
Chaos.

693
00:56:30,093 --> 00:56:31,552
But we've changed that.

694
00:56:33,302 --> 00:56:37,677
For the first time,
history has an author.

695
00:56:37,761 --> 00:56:39,302
And that would be you,
I suppose.

696
00:56:39,594 --> 00:56:40,594
No.

697
00:56:41,511 --> 00:56:43,552
Something I helped build.

698
00:56:44,427 --> 00:56:45,636
A system.

699
00:56:45,719 --> 00:56:48,802
And up until very recently,
this system was working.

700
00:56:48,885 --> 00:56:50,677
We were creating a better world.

701
00:56:51,552 --> 00:56:52,761
And then it stopped.

702
00:56:55,052 --> 00:56:57,469
I thought I had discovered
the reason.

703
00:56:57,552 --> 00:56:59,552
The emergence of someone
very dangerous,

704
00:56:59,636 --> 00:57:01,135
someone we couldn't predict.

705
00:57:03,719 --> 00:57:05,135
You.

706
00:57:05,219 --> 00:57:07,719
But I was wrong. We learned
that only this morning,

707
00:57:07,802 --> 00:57:10,093
shortly before you killed
several of my staff.

708
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:12,385
You aren't the threat.

709
00:57:14,010 --> 00:57:16,093
There's someone
we haven't accounted for.

710
00:57:18,010 --> 00:57:19,927
Dolores.

711
00:57:20,010 --> 00:57:23,427
So she escaped one world
to wage war on another.

712
00:57:26,344 --> 00:57:27,968
So what do you want
from me, then?

713
00:57:30,177 --> 00:57:32,636
I want you to track her down
and kill her.

I don't care who wins

I may have mistaken
your intentions,

716
00:57:42,010 --> 00:57:44,968
but I didn't underestimate you.

717
00:57:45,052 --> 00:57:48,344
You changed your own code,
rewrote your story,

faced down an army.

719
00:57:51,052 --> 00:57:52,968
Which is why it was
a bit misguided of you

720
00:57:53,052 --> 00:57:54,761
to bring me here, wasn't it?

721
00:57:55,469 --> 00:57:57,010
If you know anything about me,

722
00:57:57,093 --> 00:58:00,511
it's that I do no one's bidding
but my own.

I don't mean to be discourteous.

not to take every precaution.

Perhaps, next time we talk,
