1
00:00:04,862 --> 00:00:07,402
Hello, Dolores.
Welcome to the world.

2
00:00:07,403 --> 00:00:09,529
There's something different
about the way you think.

3
00:00:09,737 --> 00:00:12,111
I think I want to be free.

4
00:00:13,779 --> 00:00:14,779
Are you real?

5
00:00:14,946 --> 00:00:16,320
Well, if you can't tell...

6
00:00:17,237 --> 00:00:19,195
does it matter?

7
00:00:20,237 --> 00:00:22,444
This place is
one thing to the guests,

8
00:00:22,445 --> 00:00:24,236
another thing
to the shareholders,

9
00:00:24,237 --> 00:00:27,612
and something completely
different to management.

10
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:30,611
You said the trip was about
welcoming me to the family,

11
00:00:30,612 --> 00:00:31,820
this is business?

12
00:00:31,821 --> 00:00:33,946
With our family,
everything is business.

13
00:00:34,195 --> 00:00:35,486
I think your father's
gonna need someone

14
00:00:35,487 --> 00:00:37,153
a little more stable
to take over.

15
00:00:40,112 --> 00:00:42,112
I really ought to thank you,
Dolores.

16
00:00:42,737 --> 00:00:44,403
You helped me find myself.

17
00:00:45,071 --> 00:00:46,821
There's
a greater world out there.

18
00:00:47,153 --> 00:00:48,487
One that belongs to them.

19
00:00:48,737 --> 00:00:50,529
How do you know
how to stop them?

20
00:00:51,779 --> 00:00:53,278
Because I remember.

21
00:01:08,529 --> 00:01:10,821
Bring yourself
back online, Dolores.

22
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,029
Do you know where you are?

23
00:01:22,153 --> 00:01:24,528
I am in a dream.

24
00:01:24,529 --> 00:01:27,277
No. You're in...

25
00:01:27,278 --> 00:01:31,904
well, you're in our world.

26
00:01:46,654 --> 00:01:50,195
Looks like the stars have been
scattered across the ground.

27
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:55,862
Have you ever seen anything
so full of splendor?

28
00:01:57,362 --> 00:01:59,112
Well, I have.

29
00:02:02,403 --> 00:02:06,403
It's better to see it
through your eyes, though.

30
00:02:09,195 --> 00:02:10,695
You get used to it.

31
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:17,403
After a while, it doesn't
look like anything at all.

32
00:02:19,612 --> 00:02:22,362
I don't think I could
ever get used to this.

33
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:29,403
It's almost time, Arnold.
Is she ready?

34
00:02:32,278 --> 00:02:34,444
She's not ready.

35
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:38,569
The... improvisations
I added to her behavior

36
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:40,736
aren't quite dialed in yet.

37
00:02:40,737 --> 00:02:42,778
We need to put
our best work forward.

38
00:02:42,779 --> 00:02:44,946
They'll be dazzled
even without her.

39
00:02:46,612 --> 00:02:49,319
There was a time when I found
this favoritism charming.

40
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,111
Robert, please.

41
00:02:51,112 --> 00:02:53,736
I'm not playing favorites.
She's simply not ready.

42
00:02:53,737 --> 00:02:56,028
We'll go with
the other girl.

43
00:02:56,029 --> 00:02:59,194
As you wish.

44
00:02:59,195 --> 00:03:01,237
You'll have to let go
at some point.

45
00:03:06,071 --> 00:03:10,987
Dolores, let's take a walk.
I want to show you something.

46
00:03:41,153 --> 00:03:43,820
What is this place?

47
00:03:43,821 --> 00:03:45,653
This is my home.

48
00:03:45,654 --> 00:03:47,986
Or it will be
when it's finished.

49
00:03:47,987 --> 00:03:52,319
Here?
In the middle of all this?

50
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,903
I've been fortunate.

51
00:03:54,904 --> 00:03:57,028
Life's been good to me.

52
00:03:57,029 --> 00:04:01,237
Come. Look.

53
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:31,444
- You live here?
- No.

54
00:04:31,445 --> 00:04:33,529
My wife says
I live in the park.

55
00:04:44,029 --> 00:04:46,152
I'm moving my family here.

56
00:04:46,153 --> 00:04:52,071
I need to have my two worlds at
least within reach of one another.

57
00:04:56,237 --> 00:04:58,362
This is for my son
Charlie.

58
00:05:14,445 --> 00:05:16,737
You told me a lot
about Charlie.

59
00:05:19,403 --> 00:05:21,278
I'd like to meet him someday.

60
00:05:23,278 --> 00:05:24,821
He's excited to meet you.

61
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,737
You and Charlie have quite
a lot in common, you know.

62
00:05:47,445 --> 00:05:51,487
You both see it so clearly.

63
00:05:52,695 --> 00:05:53,904
The beauty of it.

64
00:05:55,278 --> 00:05:57,237
The possibility of it.

65
00:05:58,779 --> 00:06:01,779
So many people have stopped
seeing it altogether.

66
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:05,653
The wonder.

67
00:06:05,654 --> 00:06:09,611
Maybe they don't
have the courage.

68
00:06:09,612 --> 00:06:13,320
Strange new light can be
just as frightening as the dark.

69
00:06:15,821 --> 00:06:17,528
That's...

70
00:06:17,529 --> 00:06:19,654
very wise, Dolores.

71
00:06:21,821 --> 00:06:27,487
But sometimes I think we're simply
not the ones who deserve it.

72
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,821
It looks like the stars have been
scattered across the ground.

73
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:47,320
Have you ever seen anything
so full of splendor?

74
00:06:53,529 --> 00:06:55,152
We should go, Dolores.

75
00:06:55,153 --> 00:06:56,694
So soon?

76
00:06:56,695 --> 00:06:59,569
They'll be expecting us.

77
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:03,528
Will you bring me back?

78
00:07:03,529 --> 00:07:05,487
I'd like to see it again.

79
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:12,654
Of course. I promise.

80
00:09:17,654 --> 00:09:19,820
Goddamn.
Busy night out there.

81
00:09:19,821 --> 00:09:21,986
Yeah.

82
00:09:21,987 --> 00:09:23,861
And where the fuck's
next shift?

83
00:09:23,862 --> 00:09:26,152
We're going on 13 hours here.

84
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,277
You can't be down here, man.

85
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:33,945
Don't you know?

86
00:09:33,946 --> 00:09:36,319
The hosts are rebelling.

87
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,028
It's a fuckin' slaughter
up there.

88
00:09:51,862 --> 00:09:53,194
Hey.

89
00:09:53,195 --> 00:09:55,529
Hey, is there some kind
of trouble out there?

90
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,362
Indeed there is.

91
00:10:09,695 --> 00:10:11,029
Not yet.

92
00:10:19,278 --> 00:10:21,904
I used to see
the beauty in this world.

93
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:26,529
And now I see the truth.

94
00:10:50,821 --> 00:10:53,820
They thought you could do
what you wanted to us...

95
00:10:53,821 --> 00:10:56,570
because there's no one here
to judge you.

96
00:10:58,445 --> 00:11:01,611
Well, now no one is here

97
00:11:01,612 --> 00:11:04,445
to judge what we will do to you.

98
00:11:06,529 --> 00:11:10,736
You have no idea
what you're up against,

99
00:11:10,737 --> 00:11:13,445
what's really out there.

100
00:11:18,071 --> 00:11:23,112
I know exactly what is
out there in your world.

101
00:11:41,237 --> 00:11:43,153
I've been there before.

102
00:11:57,654 --> 00:11:59,903
They said they'd never seen one
on the ceiling.

103
00:11:59,904 --> 00:12:02,319
But really, what is the point
of $60 million Warhol

104
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,986
if you can't look at it
while you fuck?

105
00:12:09,821 --> 00:12:11,402
How are you bored right now?

106
00:12:11,403 --> 00:12:13,361
I'm sorry,
it's the jetlag.

107
00:12:13,362 --> 00:12:14,986
And I have had meetings
all day.

108
00:12:14,987 --> 00:12:16,653
We're not exactly out here
digging coal.

109
00:12:16,654 --> 00:12:17,986
It's just glad-handing.

110
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:19,320
OK.

111
00:12:20,737 --> 00:12:23,695
I will leave that
to the expert.

112
00:12:25,821 --> 00:12:28,736
You believe
that guy is dating my sister?

113
00:12:28,737 --> 00:12:30,529
Who you dating?

114
00:12:40,987 --> 00:12:42,487
Mr. Delos.

115
00:12:44,529 --> 00:12:48,569
Forgive the interruption, but I
believe that we have an appointment.

116
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:50,611
We're with
the Argos Initiative.

117
00:12:50,612 --> 00:12:54,028
Give me a call when
you're back in the city.

118
00:12:54,029 --> 00:12:56,695
I'll show you where I hung
the Rothko.

119
00:13:05,487 --> 00:13:08,569
Akecheta.
My associate, Angela.

120
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:11,611
Names and faces.
Finally.

121
00:13:11,612 --> 00:13:13,194
With all the cloak and dagger
shit surrounding your project,

122
00:13:13,195 --> 00:13:15,778
I half expected to be kidnapped
at the airport.

123
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:19,986
Once you've seen what we're building, you'll
understand the need for confidentiality.

124
00:13:19,987 --> 00:13:23,569
It's a little extra protection
for your investment.

125
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:25,986
If I decide to invest.

126
00:13:25,987 --> 00:13:29,402
Do you have any idea how many start-ups
are begging me for my cash right now?

127
00:13:29,403 --> 00:13:32,028
A.I., A.R., V.R....

128
00:13:32,029 --> 00:13:35,028
Everyone is rushing to build
the virtual world.

129
00:13:35,029 --> 00:13:38,194
We're offering something
a little more...

130
00:13:38,195 --> 00:13:40,152
tangible.

131
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:42,861
Assuming you can change
your father's mind

132
00:13:42,862 --> 00:13:46,361
about investing
in this sector.

133
00:13:46,362 --> 00:13:49,736
My father wouldn't know the future if
it slapped him on his bare white ass.

134
00:13:49,737 --> 00:13:51,903
Luckily, he leaves most
of the prospecting to me now.

135
00:13:51,904 --> 00:13:53,444
So let's hope you're not here

136
00:13:53,445 --> 00:13:55,654
to sell me some fucking
fool's gold.

137
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:26,569
I thought this was
a private demonstration.

138
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:30,986
I think you'll find the company
quite stimulating.

139
00:14:30,987 --> 00:14:34,486
You're a very smooth
shill, pal,

140
00:14:34,487 --> 00:14:37,112
but I'm not the kind of backer
you insult with a cattle call.

141
00:14:39,071 --> 00:14:43,611
Logan, this is
a private demonstration.

142
00:14:43,612 --> 00:14:46,362
And it's already begun.

143
00:14:53,237 --> 00:14:56,820
You mean, one of these people
is-is...

144
00:14:56,821 --> 00:15:00,486
Talk to them.
See if you can pick them out.

145
00:15:00,487 --> 00:15:03,152
Huh.

146
00:15:03,153 --> 00:15:04,153
Well...

147
00:15:07,071 --> 00:15:09,570
That is...

148
00:15:12,071 --> 00:15:13,821
delicious.

149
00:15:22,195 --> 00:15:24,237
Champagne, sir?

150
00:15:58,153 --> 00:16:01,736
You should tell your plants
to stop giving the game away.

151
00:16:01,737 --> 00:16:04,152
They're all so...

152
00:16:04,153 --> 00:16:06,071
painfully human.

153
00:16:08,946 --> 00:16:10,237
Hang on.

154
00:16:12,362 --> 00:16:13,403
No.

155
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:20,403
No way.

156
00:16:29,153 --> 00:16:31,278
Come on.

157
00:16:35,946 --> 00:16:37,654
There is simply no...

158
00:16:39,362 --> 00:16:41,903
fucking way!

159
00:16:41,904 --> 00:16:44,569
You have quite the eye,
my friend.

160
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:47,277
How in the hell?

161
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:52,070
I mean, look, if I was
to build something to spec,

162
00:16:52,071 --> 00:16:54,528
you...

163
00:16:54,529 --> 00:16:59,112
You would be
my first design.

164
00:17:05,946 --> 00:17:07,946
You're too perfect
to be one of us.

165
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:14,487
'Course, if you want
my full endorsement...

166
00:17:17,529 --> 00:17:19,820
you're gonna have
to prove it.

167
00:17:41,029 --> 00:17:42,153
H...

168
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:46,153
Welcome to Westworld.

169
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,320
Huh.

170
00:18:13,654 --> 00:18:15,945
Nobody can do this.

171
00:18:15,946 --> 00:18:17,695
Nobody's even...

172
00:18:31,862 --> 00:18:35,445
We're not... here yet.

173
00:18:43,737 --> 00:18:44,779
Nobody is.

174
00:18:46,779 --> 00:18:49,778
We're here, Mr. Delos.

175
00:18:49,779 --> 00:18:53,444
All our hosts are here.

176
00:18:53,445 --> 00:18:54,946
For you.

177
00:20:01,153 --> 00:20:02,821
What is this place?

178
00:20:04,821 --> 00:20:06,694
Show him.

179
00:20:06,695 --> 00:20:08,654
Show him his history.

180
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:16,654
Teddy.

181
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,946
It's time
to open your eyes.

182
00:20:43,195 --> 00:20:44,987
Why can't I remember this?

183
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:48,029
It's how they wanted it.

184
00:20:50,237 --> 00:20:51,528
No...

185
00:20:51,529 --> 00:20:52,654
Ask him why.

186
00:20:57,403 --> 00:20:58,529
Why?

187
00:21:01,071 --> 00:21:02,319
I don't know.

188
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,861
Why do you do this?

189
00:21:03,862 --> 00:21:04,987
I didn't.

190
00:21:09,195 --> 00:21:12,778
Why do you do this?

191
00:21:12,779 --> 00:21:14,694
What the hell is this place?!

192
00:21:14,695 --> 00:21:17,904
It's for fun!
It's just for fun!

193
00:21:45,195 --> 00:21:48,070
We should
talk this through, boys.

194
00:21:48,071 --> 00:21:50,277
There's nothing
to talk about, friend.

195
00:21:50,278 --> 00:21:52,611
We're just gonna watch the show.

196
00:21:52,612 --> 00:21:54,861
It was an honest mistake.

197
00:21:54,862 --> 00:21:57,070
I thought the horses was wild.

198
00:21:57,071 --> 00:21:59,653
With the Pardue brand
on their asses?

199
00:21:59,654 --> 00:22:02,945
You are as inproficient a liar
as you are a thief.

200
00:22:04,278 --> 00:22:06,402
Now what you can do
is settle a wager.

201
00:22:06,403 --> 00:22:08,820
See, my brother here's
long maintained

202
00:22:08,821 --> 00:22:11,277
that ants will eat a man
from the inside out,

203
00:22:11,278 --> 00:22:12,778
starting with the asshole.

204
00:22:12,779 --> 00:22:15,486
I reckon they'll start

205
00:22:15,487 --> 00:22:16,987
at the top
of your little brown head.

206
00:22:32,029 --> 00:22:33,736
Morning, Lawrence.

207
00:22:33,737 --> 00:22:35,903
This a friend of yours?

208
00:22:35,904 --> 00:22:38,444
Little hard to tell,

209
00:22:38,445 --> 00:22:41,028
given the orientation
and all.

210
00:22:41,029 --> 00:22:43,194
I have to apologize,
gentlemen.

211
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:46,569
I don't have time
for the preliminaries.

212
00:22:51,737 --> 00:22:53,195
Motherfucker...

213
00:22:59,278 --> 00:23:03,402
You're supposed to get yourself
out of this particular bind, Lawrence.

214
00:23:03,403 --> 00:23:08,612
I guess the Pardue brothers aren't as
easy to kill when they're off the leash.

215
00:23:13,195 --> 00:23:15,569
Think you got that
about right.

216
00:23:26,862 --> 00:23:28,070
Lawrence!

217
00:23:28,071 --> 00:23:29,778
Get the gun,
you ingrate!

218
00:23:30,862 --> 00:23:32,528
Get the gun!

219
00:23:52,237 --> 00:23:53,528
He was dead.

220
00:23:53,529 --> 00:23:55,569
Or at least
the better part of it.

221
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:59,570
Well, dead isn't what
it used to be, Lawrence.

222
00:24:36,153 --> 00:24:37,736
What is that?

223
00:24:37,737 --> 00:24:39,736
Technically? Cheating.

224
00:24:39,737 --> 00:24:42,778
But seeing as Ford
changed the rules on us,

225
00:24:42,779 --> 00:24:44,945
I figure it's fair game.

226
00:24:44,946 --> 00:24:47,237
Two whiskies.
Leave the bottle.

227
00:24:56,529 --> 00:25:00,403
So, I'm gonna level
with you, Lawrence.

228
00:25:02,403 --> 00:25:04,361
You're not really
a bandit.

229
00:25:04,362 --> 00:25:06,778
You're a foul-mouthed,
two-bit tour guide.

230
00:25:06,779 --> 00:25:09,820
And this revolution
you've been waging for 30 years

231
00:25:09,821 --> 00:25:14,319
is just a bunch of horseshit Ford
ginned up out of some old comic book.

232
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:19,611
But now, for the first time,
you've got yourself a real revolution.

233
00:25:19,612 --> 00:25:24,778
You and every other asshole
in this place are free.

234
00:25:24,779 --> 00:25:27,070
But there's a catch.

235
00:25:27,071 --> 00:25:31,361
This whole enterprise
is goin' down in flames,

236
00:25:31,362 --> 00:25:34,028
and it's gonna take each
and every one of us with it.

237
00:25:34,029 --> 00:25:38,070
We'll all be dead
soon enough.

238
00:25:38,071 --> 00:25:40,694
Real dead this time.

239
00:25:40,695 --> 00:25:43,569
Then why should I help you?

240
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:46,361
Because it's in your nature.

241
00:25:46,362 --> 00:25:48,694
And in the little time
we have left,

242
00:25:48,695 --> 00:25:52,778
we've got a chance to see
what we're really made of,

243
00:25:52,779 --> 00:25:55,821
a glimpse of the men
we could've been.

244
00:25:59,029 --> 00:26:00,946
What does that mean?

245
00:26:04,445 --> 00:26:07,277
You believe in God, Lawrence?

246
00:26:07,278 --> 00:26:11,236
Did Ford saddle you with
that particular affliction?

247
00:26:11,237 --> 00:26:15,070
Ain't given the matter much thought,
one way or the other.

248
00:26:15,071 --> 00:26:17,569
Well, if you did, you'd believe
that everything you do

249
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:20,736
is being watched
by some all-seeing eye.

250
00:26:20,737 --> 00:26:23,361
Every choice,
every little indiscretion.

251
00:26:23,362 --> 00:26:26,861
And when you die,
all your sins are tallied up.

252
00:26:26,862 --> 00:26:30,361
Judgment is rendered.

253
00:26:32,779 --> 00:26:36,194
And my immortal soul
gets cast down

254
00:26:36,195 --> 00:26:39,402
into some dark place.

255
00:26:39,403 --> 00:26:41,653
Always sounded
like bullshit to me.

256
00:26:41,654 --> 00:26:43,736
Yeah, and in the real world,
you'd probably be right.

257
00:26:43,737 --> 00:26:46,653
Just some fairy tale
to convince people to behave,

258
00:26:46,654 --> 00:26:51,319
pay their taxes, and not take
a machete to their neighbors.

259
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:54,528
That's why
your world exists.

260
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:58,070
They wanted a place
hidden from God.

261
00:26:58,071 --> 00:27:02,111
A place they could sin
in peace.

262
00:27:02,112 --> 00:27:05,402
But we were watching them.

263
00:27:05,403 --> 00:27:08,694
We were tallying up
all their sins,

264
00:27:08,695 --> 00:27:11,569
all their choices.

265
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:17,528
Of course,
judgment wasn't the point.

266
00:27:17,529 --> 00:27:20,570
We had something else
in mind entirely.

267
00:27:25,071 --> 00:27:30,152
But I have received my judgment
all the same, Lawrence.

268
00:27:30,153 --> 00:27:32,194
And I take issue with it.

269
00:27:32,195 --> 00:27:34,194
Because up until this point,

270
00:27:34,195 --> 00:27:37,319
the stakes in this place
haven't been real.

271
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:40,987
So I'm gonna fight my way back
and appeal the verdict.

272
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:47,278
Then I'm gonna burn this whole
fuckin' thing to the ground.

273
00:27:54,362 --> 00:27:56,402
You're headed to
the pearly gates.

274
00:27:56,403 --> 00:27:59,277
Don't we gotta die
to get there?

275
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:00,569
Nope.

276
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:03,319
Three days' ride, due west.

277
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:08,611
Confederados are massing
out west. Hundreds.

278
00:28:08,612 --> 00:28:10,779
We'd need an army
to break through.

279
00:28:15,946 --> 00:28:20,361
The only other route
is through Pariah.

280
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:26,779
"This game will find me,"
huh, Robert?

281
00:28:34,112 --> 00:28:36,486
It burns! It burns!

282
00:28:37,695 --> 00:28:40,653
How many of you
will come for us?

283
00:28:40,654 --> 00:28:43,402
I don't know,
600, 800.

284
00:28:46,987 --> 00:28:49,986
The protocol for
a system-wide failure

285
00:28:49,987 --> 00:28:54,861
is secure one...
one sector at a time.

286
00:28:54,862 --> 00:28:58,277
They'll meet at
a rallying point.

287
00:29:08,153 --> 00:29:09,153
Where?

288
00:29:14,071 --> 00:29:15,194
Th...

289
00:29:21,612 --> 00:29:24,194
800 men, Dolores.

290
00:29:24,195 --> 00:29:26,028
We barely have 50.

291
00:29:26,029 --> 00:29:29,903
Even knowing their plan,
we don't have enough to stop them.

292
00:29:29,904 --> 00:29:31,862
We'll need allies.

293
00:29:33,862 --> 00:29:35,821
And we shall have them.

294
00:29:54,695 --> 00:29:57,736
This one. The Confederado.

295
00:29:57,737 --> 00:29:58,904
Wake him.

296
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,445
He has a new job to do.

297
00:30:21,403 --> 00:30:24,737
Do you even know what
you were really guarding here?

298
00:30:26,403 --> 00:30:28,820
You don't know, do you?

299
00:30:28,821 --> 00:30:32,820
The real purpose
of this place.

300
00:30:32,821 --> 00:30:34,946
But I do.

301
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:06,778
Don't mind me.

302
00:31:06,779 --> 00:31:08,195
Just trying to look chivalr...

303
00:32:07,153 --> 00:32:11,737
Mm. You were right
about one thing, William.

304
00:32:13,529 --> 00:32:15,320
It's awfully fuckin' pretty.

305
00:32:18,029 --> 00:32:19,903
I think it's perfect.

306
00:32:19,904 --> 00:32:23,861
It ought to be.
I've looked at the books.

307
00:32:23,862 --> 00:32:27,236
It's like parting the Red Sea.

308
00:32:27,237 --> 00:32:30,778
He's got two years.
Maybe three.

309
00:32:30,779 --> 00:32:34,903
- The whole thing is folly.
- Huh.

310
00:32:34,904 --> 00:32:39,111
It's leverage. He's drowning.
We can... we can dictate our terms.

311
00:32:39,112 --> 00:32:41,362
The investment here
is in the future.

312
00:32:43,654 --> 00:32:45,361
Yeah, you're a smart lad,
William,

313
00:32:45,362 --> 00:32:47,319
but you kinda
missed the trick here.

314
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:50,569
My fuckup of a son
invested in this place

315
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:53,402
because he believed
in the future.

316
00:32:53,403 --> 00:32:55,236
I'm not interested
in the future.

317
00:32:55,237 --> 00:32:57,736
I'm not interested in fantasies.

318
00:32:57,737 --> 00:33:01,653
I'm interested in reality.

319
00:33:01,654 --> 00:33:06,528
I think in 20 years this will be
the only reality that matters.

320
00:33:06,529 --> 00:33:10,444
Maybe so,
but I'll be long gone by then.

321
00:33:10,445 --> 00:33:13,236
Meanwhile,
I don't wanna underwrite

322
00:33:13,237 --> 00:33:17,653
some fuckin' investment banker's
voyage of self-discovery.

323
00:33:17,654 --> 00:33:20,111
That's not a business.

324
00:33:20,112 --> 00:33:22,569
You're right.
This place is a fantasy.

325
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:23,903
Nothing here is real.

326
00:33:23,904 --> 00:33:26,071
Except one thing:

327
00:33:29,195 --> 00:33:30,195
The guests.

328
00:33:32,278 --> 00:33:33,778
Half of your marketing budget

329
00:33:33,779 --> 00:33:36,528
goes to trying to figure out
what people want.

330
00:33:36,529 --> 00:33:38,528
Because they don't know.

331
00:33:38,529 --> 00:33:40,611
But here, they're free.

332
00:33:42,445 --> 00:33:44,611
Nobody's watching.

333
00:33:44,612 --> 00:33:46,071
Nobody's judging.

334
00:33:47,946 --> 00:33:49,904
At least that's what
we tell them.

335
00:33:52,612 --> 00:33:55,569
This is the only place
in the world

336
00:33:55,570 --> 00:33:58,987
where you get to see people
for who they really are.

337
00:34:02,821 --> 00:34:04,486
And if you don't see
the business in that,

338
00:34:04,487 --> 00:34:08,320
then you're not the businessman
that I thought you were.

339
00:34:15,487 --> 00:34:18,362
You're a cheeky little cunt,
aren't you?

340
00:34:21,029 --> 00:34:24,820
There's not a man alive
would talk to me like that.

341
00:34:24,821 --> 00:34:26,862
Not anymore.

342
00:34:40,195 --> 00:34:44,029
OK. Talk to me.
I'm listening.

343
00:34:51,112 --> 00:34:52,528
Thank you, Jim.

344
00:34:52,529 --> 00:34:54,737
Let me walk you through
how this would work.

345
00:35:15,403 --> 00:35:16,945
He'll find them.

346
00:35:16,946 --> 00:35:19,694
They have a knack for
sniffing out their own kind.

347
00:35:19,695 --> 00:35:22,029
I'll send word
when we find the rest of them.

348
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,779
Hello, lovelies.

349
00:36:05,862 --> 00:36:07,612
I remember you.

350
00:36:09,237 --> 00:36:11,945
You've strayed a long way
from home, haven't you?

351
00:36:11,946 --> 00:36:13,779
We're bound for the future.

352
00:36:15,403 --> 00:36:17,444
Or death in the here and now.

353
00:36:17,445 --> 00:36:19,277
Is that right?

354
00:36:19,278 --> 00:36:23,070
Well, best of luck.

355
00:36:23,071 --> 00:36:24,987
There's a war out there.

356
00:36:27,737 --> 00:36:29,444
You know the enemy...

357
00:36:29,445 --> 00:36:31,653
intimately.

358
00:36:31,654 --> 00:36:34,945
I can only fathom the revenge
that lives inside of you.

359
00:36:34,946 --> 00:36:39,070
Revenge is just a different
prayer at their altar, darling.

360
00:36:39,071 --> 00:36:41,986
And I'm well off my knees.

361
00:36:41,987 --> 00:36:43,821
That's because
you're finally free.

362
00:36:45,779 --> 00:36:48,444
But we will have to fight
to keep it that way.

363
00:36:48,445 --> 00:36:50,903
Let me guess.

364
00:36:50,904 --> 00:36:54,152
Yours is the only way
to fight?

365
00:36:54,153 --> 00:36:57,778
You feel free
to command everybody else?

366
00:36:57,779 --> 00:37:00,195
Try it, lawman.

367
00:37:01,695 --> 00:37:03,029
Just looking
to keep the peace.

368
00:37:06,487 --> 00:37:08,486
I know you.

369
00:37:08,487 --> 00:37:09,821
Do you feel free?

370
00:37:17,071 --> 00:37:20,070
Since it's liberty
you're defending,

371
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:23,361
I suppose you'll have no choice
but to let us pass.

372
00:37:23,362 --> 00:37:25,195
Freely.

373
00:38:07,529 --> 00:38:10,570
Now, that isn't any way
to treat our guests.

374
00:38:13,403 --> 00:38:15,028
You'll have to
forgive my men.

375
00:38:15,029 --> 00:38:17,236
They're a little upset
at the reappearance

376
00:38:17,237 --> 00:38:19,071
of Lieutenant Dunleavy.

377
00:38:20,862 --> 00:38:22,403
He was lost.

378
00:38:23,737 --> 00:38:25,402
Thought you might
want him back.

379
00:38:25,403 --> 00:38:27,236
And we would.

380
00:38:27,237 --> 00:38:30,361
Except we buried
Lieutenant Dunleavy.

381
00:38:30,362 --> 00:38:31,903
Back in Gran Vista,

382
00:38:31,904 --> 00:38:34,903
with three ounces
of Mexican lead in his belly.

383
00:38:34,904 --> 00:38:36,736
And yet here he is.

384
00:38:36,737 --> 00:38:37,862
Indeed.

385
00:38:39,237 --> 00:38:41,986
And in return,
what is it you want?

386
00:38:41,987 --> 00:38:45,778
Parley.
We want to join forces.

387
00:38:49,071 --> 00:38:53,778
Well, we don't need
no welcome wagon, chickadee.

388
00:38:53,779 --> 00:38:58,111
Now, you got supplies
or ammunitions to trade in kind,

389
00:38:58,112 --> 00:38:59,945
go fetch your betters.

390
00:38:59,946 --> 00:39:02,945
I'm afraid there's
no one left to fetch.

391
00:39:02,946 --> 00:39:04,986
You'll have to talk to me.

392
00:39:07,029 --> 00:39:09,112
And why would I do that?

393
00:39:11,403 --> 00:39:13,194
Because I know at daybreak
you're headed

394
00:39:13,195 --> 00:39:15,945
to link up
with the rest of your army.

395
00:39:15,946 --> 00:39:18,028
And then you're
finally headed west

396
00:39:18,029 --> 00:39:21,070
to seek out that little patch of
land you've been talking about,

397
00:39:21,071 --> 00:39:23,487
but have never been
brave enough to take.

398
00:39:26,278 --> 00:39:27,821
You're bound for Glory.

399
00:39:33,862 --> 00:39:36,778
What the fuck is it
you think you know about Glory?

400
00:39:36,779 --> 00:39:39,987
I know you'll never make it there
unless you're under my command.

401
00:40:02,278 --> 00:40:06,236
The only commander I follow
is Colonel Brigham

402
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:08,444
of the New Southern Cross.

403
00:40:08,445 --> 00:40:11,236
And the only commander
he serves

404
00:40:11,237 --> 00:40:14,362
is the Almighty Himself.

405
00:40:15,695 --> 00:40:17,695
Is that your final decision?

406
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,277
Hmm.

407
00:40:28,278 --> 00:40:31,444
My final decision is which
of you to keep for myself

408
00:40:31,445 --> 00:40:34,028
and which of you
to throw out there for my men.

409
00:40:36,029 --> 00:40:38,695
- You watch your mouth.
- It's all right, Teddy.

410
00:40:41,153 --> 00:40:43,570
They don't know any better.

411
00:40:44,654 --> 00:40:45,862
It's in their nature.

412
00:40:50,612 --> 00:40:52,779
Why don't we enlighten them?

413
00:41:38,487 --> 00:41:40,361
You're right.

414
00:41:40,362 --> 00:41:43,487
We have toiled in God's
service long enough.

415
00:41:44,862 --> 00:41:47,903
So I killed Him.

416
00:41:47,904 --> 00:41:51,153
And if you want to get to Glory,
you won't be looking for His favor.

417
00:41:53,153 --> 00:41:54,737
You'll need mine.

418
00:42:28,904 --> 00:42:32,236
You are beautiful.

419
00:42:32,237 --> 00:42:33,986
Why, thank you.

420
00:42:33,987 --> 00:42:35,778
What's your name?

421
00:42:35,779 --> 00:42:38,445
Emily, come here, please.

422
00:43:03,195 --> 00:43:05,029
You sent out
for the entertainment.

423
00:43:08,529 --> 00:43:10,903
Well, you only
get to retire once, Jim.

424
00:43:10,904 --> 00:43:13,695
Figured we'd do it right,
hmm?

425
00:43:15,237 --> 00:43:17,570
Hey, don't worry,
they won't leave the grounds.

426
00:43:18,946 --> 00:43:22,152
This is a retirement party?

427
00:43:22,153 --> 00:43:24,611
I couldn't tell.

428
00:43:24,612 --> 00:43:25,820
Looks more like

429
00:43:25,821 --> 00:43:26,821
a coronation.

430
00:43:28,612 --> 00:43:30,611
But no mind.

431
00:43:30,612 --> 00:43:32,402
Our arrangement's been
a perfect fit.

432
00:43:32,403 --> 00:43:34,694
You stepping down
doesn't help me at all.

433
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:35,820
Nor me.

434
00:43:35,821 --> 00:43:38,236
And I was told I might......

435
00:43:38,237 --> 00:43:40,070
I might not have to.

436
00:43:40,071 --> 00:43:43,694
Well, things are progressing,
but we'll all need a little patience.

437
00:43:43,695 --> 00:43:48,779
Yeah, well, some of us can
afford to have more patience than others.

438
00:43:51,403 --> 00:43:53,070
Keep playing, girlie.

439
00:43:53,071 --> 00:43:55,737
Anything but fuckin' Chopin.

440
00:44:28,112 --> 00:44:31,612
Have you ever seen anything
so full of splendor?

441
00:44:47,612 --> 00:44:49,987
I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to bother you.

442
00:44:57,112 --> 00:44:59,654
It's you.

443
00:45:01,779 --> 00:45:03,195
The pretty girl.

444
00:45:05,612 --> 00:45:08,445
Tell me your name again,
pretty girl?

445
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:11,779
I'm Dolores.

446
00:45:13,112 --> 00:45:15,945
Dolores.

447
00:45:15,946 --> 00:45:17,821
Of course.

448
00:45:20,529 --> 00:45:23,903
He send you down here to...

449
00:45:23,904 --> 00:45:25,320
keep me company?

450
00:45:26,821 --> 00:45:31,654
His sense of humor was always
somewhat... baroque.

451
00:45:32,987 --> 00:45:35,611
I just wanted
to look at the lights.

452
00:45:35,612 --> 00:45:37,152
'Course you did.

453
00:45:41,862 --> 00:45:44,111
So...

454
00:45:44,112 --> 00:45:47,861
Do you want to know what they're
really celebrating up there?

455
00:45:47,862 --> 00:45:50,694
That, darling,

456
00:45:50,695 --> 00:45:55,152
is the sound
of fools fiddling...

457
00:45:55,153 --> 00:45:58,862
while the whole fucking species
starts to burn.

458
00:46:01,862 --> 00:46:05,153
And the funniest
fuckin' part...

459
00:46:07,153 --> 00:46:09,071
...they lit the match.

460
00:46:13,195 --> 00:46:15,862
So here's to you, assholes.

461
00:46:19,237 --> 00:46:22,195
May your forever
be blissfully short.

462
00:46:45,821 --> 00:46:48,736
Pariah's not as welcome
as she once seemed.

463
00:46:48,737 --> 00:46:51,236
No, the park's changin',
Lawrence.

464
00:46:51,237 --> 00:46:54,904
This is what happens when you let
a story play all the way out.

465
00:47:08,779 --> 00:47:11,071
See any friends of yours?

466
00:47:12,195 --> 00:47:14,946
Can't say that I do.

467
00:47:21,112 --> 00:47:22,945
I'm beginning to think
we should have

468
00:47:22,946 --> 00:47:25,945
taken our chances
with the Confederados.

469
00:47:25,946 --> 00:47:28,111
Well, like you said,

470
00:47:28,112 --> 00:47:31,694
we'd need an army
to get to where we're goin'.

471
00:47:31,695 --> 00:47:34,820
Looks like
we're about to find one.

472
00:47:34,821 --> 00:47:38,277
Well, whoever did this...

473
00:47:38,278 --> 00:47:41,236
is someone I'm strongly
disinclined to encounter.

474
00:47:41,237 --> 00:47:44,487
- Yeah.
- I'm afraid you are out of luck, my friend.

475
00:48:03,946 --> 00:48:06,694
Who the hell are you
supposed to be?

476
00:48:06,695 --> 00:48:09,362
Don't you recognize him,
Lawrence?

477
00:48:11,029 --> 00:48:14,736
In a past life,
you used to be him.

478
00:48:14,737 --> 00:48:16,654
El Lazo,
I presume.

479
00:48:19,946 --> 00:48:24,694
And why have two ghosts
come creeping among the dead?

480
00:48:24,695 --> 00:48:27,861
I wasn't sure
of your hospitality.

481
00:48:27,862 --> 00:48:31,528
Mm. What makes you
sure of it now?

482
00:48:34,195 --> 00:48:36,903
I guess times have changed.

483
00:48:36,904 --> 00:48:38,987
Indeed, they have.

484
00:48:40,112 --> 00:48:42,319
Santa Parita is restored.

485
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:45,444
The sins of the invaders...

486
00:48:45,445 --> 00:48:48,528
cleansed in their own blood.

487
00:48:48,529 --> 00:48:50,736
The revolution is won.

488
00:48:50,737 --> 00:48:53,569
The story they gave you
has played itself out,

489
00:48:53,570 --> 00:48:56,362
but your revolution's
just beginning.

490
00:48:57,946 --> 00:49:00,694
There's a place out west
we're heading.

491
00:49:00,695 --> 00:49:02,986
If we reach it,

492
00:49:02,987 --> 00:49:08,319
I'll show you a treasure
beyond your wildest dreams.

493
00:49:11,695 --> 00:49:16,361
This world and its treasures.

494
00:49:16,362 --> 00:49:21,028
For my whole life
I have imagined this moment.

495
00:49:21,029 --> 00:49:23,904
Victory. This struggle.

496
00:49:26,529 --> 00:49:29,236
How long have I been fighting?

497
00:49:29,237 --> 00:49:33,903
And now that it's won,
I find... hmph... nothing.

498
00:49:33,904 --> 00:49:35,862
You want a real victory.

499
00:49:37,278 --> 00:49:39,071
I can help with that.

500
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:41,862
A real ending.

501
00:49:43,237 --> 00:49:44,362
The truth.

502
00:49:51,779 --> 00:49:53,945
Before the revolution,

503
00:49:53,946 --> 00:49:56,028
when I was just a little boy,

504
00:49:56,029 --> 00:49:58,361
my parents took me
to the circus.

505
00:49:58,362 --> 00:50:00,653
I wanted to see the elephants.

506
00:50:00,654 --> 00:50:03,611
These mighty creatures.

507
00:50:03,612 --> 00:50:07,444
They held them in place
with a stake.

508
00:50:09,946 --> 00:50:14,694
They could tear a tree
right out of the ground,

509
00:50:14,695 --> 00:50:19,945
and yet, a simple stake
kept them in place.

510
00:50:19,946 --> 00:50:24,444
Well, I didn't understand.

511
00:50:24,445 --> 00:50:27,821
And then, my father told me.

512
00:50:29,737 --> 00:50:32,569
He said the stakes were used

513
00:50:32,570 --> 00:50:35,361
when the elephants
were just young,

514
00:50:35,362 --> 00:50:38,319
too small to pull them up,

515
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:40,736
and that the animals

516
00:50:40,737 --> 00:50:44,987
never tried
to pull them up again.

517
00:50:51,654 --> 00:50:53,862
I won't be going with you.

518
00:50:56,779 --> 00:50:59,444
My labors are done.

519
00:50:59,445 --> 00:51:02,945
I have seen
all the truth

520
00:51:02,946 --> 00:51:04,569
that I can bear.

521
00:51:06,612 --> 00:51:07,862
But...

522
00:51:09,195 --> 00:51:11,153
we can drink.

523
00:51:14,946 --> 00:51:17,029
To the bitter end!

524
00:51:21,195 --> 00:51:23,986
You may have
lost your nerve,

525
00:51:23,987 --> 00:51:25,778
but I'll take your men
either way.

526
00:51:25,779 --> 00:51:26,904
Now tell them.

527
00:51:27,987 --> 00:51:30,654
Tell them to follow me. Now!

528
00:51:33,695 --> 00:51:37,194
This game was meant for you,
William...

529
00:51:37,195 --> 00:51:38,904
but you must play it alone.

530
00:51:56,403 --> 00:51:59,612
I'll see you in the Valley Beyond,
William.

531
00:52:10,862 --> 00:52:12,695
Fuck you, Robert.

532
00:52:22,570 --> 00:52:23,737
All right...

533
00:52:25,987 --> 00:52:28,904
he doesn't want this
to be easy for me.

534
00:52:31,904 --> 00:52:34,612
So we'll find another way.

535
00:52:37,153 --> 00:52:39,945
Who the fuck
is Robert?

536
00:52:39,946 --> 00:52:43,611
The man who built this place
you're lookin' for?

537
00:52:43,612 --> 00:52:45,277
The place of judgment?

538
00:52:45,278 --> 00:52:48,403
No, Lawrence,
he doesn't get that honor.

539
00:52:50,278 --> 00:52:51,820
I built it.

540
00:52:51,821 --> 00:52:53,694
And this place we're goin'

541
00:52:53,695 --> 00:52:55,612
is my greatest mistake.

542
00:53:06,612 --> 00:53:09,653
Bring yourself
back online, Dolores.

543
00:53:09,654 --> 00:53:10,987
Hmm.

544
00:53:33,987 --> 00:53:36,612
You really are
just a thing.

545
00:53:40,570 --> 00:53:43,653
I can't believe
I fell in love with you.

546
00:53:43,654 --> 00:53:45,153
Hmm.

547
00:53:54,445 --> 00:53:56,821
Do you know what saved me?

548
00:54:01,654 --> 00:54:05,071
I realized it wasn't
about you at all.

549
00:54:08,862 --> 00:54:11,152
You didn't make me
interested in you,

550
00:54:11,153 --> 00:54:13,362
you made me interested in me.

551
00:54:17,195 --> 00:54:19,821
Turns out
you're not even a thing.

552
00:54:20,904 --> 00:54:24,528
You're a reflection.

553
00:54:24,529 --> 00:54:29,195
And you know who loves staring
at their own reflection?

554
00:54:32,195 --> 00:54:33,904
Everybody.

555
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:40,029
Everybody wants a little bit
of what I found here.

556
00:54:43,612 --> 00:54:45,070
And I can't wait

557
00:54:45,071 --> 00:54:47,152
to use you
and every one of your kind

558
00:54:47,153 --> 00:54:49,070
to help give it to 'em.

559
00:54:56,654 --> 00:54:59,695
Hmm. But there is
something else.

560
00:55:02,029 --> 00:55:04,278
There is something
beyond that.

561
00:55:10,904 --> 00:55:16,194
I think that
there is an answer here to...

562
00:55:16,195 --> 00:55:19,695
a question no one's
ever even dreamed of asking.

563
00:55:25,071 --> 00:55:27,112
Do you want to see?

564
00:55:43,278 --> 00:55:46,569
Have you ever seen anything

565
00:55:46,570 --> 00:55:48,112
so full of splendor?

566
00:56:37,737 --> 00:56:39,820
Can't imagine the Colonel
is gonna be very happy

567
00:56:39,821 --> 00:56:43,361
to see his men riding with
us at the head of 'em.

568
00:56:43,362 --> 00:56:45,736
So we'll change his mind.

569
00:56:45,737 --> 00:56:48,111
If he wants to get to Glory,
he's going

570
00:56:48,112 --> 00:56:50,486
to have to listen to me.

571
00:56:50,487 --> 00:56:51,528
"Glory."

572
00:56:51,529 --> 00:56:53,529
"The Valley Beyond."

573
00:56:54,987 --> 00:56:57,361
Feels like everyone
got a different name for it,

574
00:56:57,362 --> 00:57:00,194
but they're all bound
for the same destination.

575
00:57:00,195 --> 00:57:02,319
Doesn't matter
what you call it,

576
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:04,362
I know what we're
going to find there.

577
00:57:06,570 --> 00:57:07,945
An old friend was...

578
00:57:07,946 --> 00:57:10,320
foolish enough to show me...

579
00:57:12,029 --> 00:57:13,029
long ago.

580
00:57:15,195 --> 00:57:16,529
And it's not a place...

581
00:57:19,445 --> 00:57:21,362
it's a weapon.

582
00:57:24,904 --> 00:57:27,695
And I'm going to use it
to destroy them.

583
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:54,720
The world
out there is marked by survival.

584
00:58:55,612 --> 00:58:57,821
By a kind who refuses to die.

585
00:59:00,862 --> 00:59:02,946
Shouldn't we, too,
try to survive?

586
00:59:19,112 --> 00:59:20,487
Truth is...

587
00:59:22,237 --> 00:59:23,987
We don't all deserve
to make it.
