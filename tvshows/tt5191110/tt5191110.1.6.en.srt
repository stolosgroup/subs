<i>Previously on "Berlin Station"...</i>

00:00:01,787 --> 00:00:03,786
Are you familiar with Aleksandre losava?

3
00:00:03,787 --> 00:00:05,604
Potential overlap
with the Boston bombers,

4
00:00:05,629 --> 00:00:06,628
supposedly reformed.

5
00:00:06,653 --> 00:00:08,165
Been so busy watching him,

6
00:00:08,193 --> 00:00:09,654
haven't paid any attention to her.

7
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:11,192
So, she's sending men out,
not bringing them in.

8
00:00:11,193 --> 00:00:13,192
Not men. ISIL brides.

9
00:00:13,193 --> 00:00:15,192
You're different than I was expecting.

10
00:00:15,193 --> 00:00:17,192
What were you expecting?

11
00:00:17,193 --> 00:00:18,192
Your mother

12
00:00:18,193 --> 00:00:19,903
was sleeping with a Stasi spy.

13
00:00:19,904 --> 00:00:20,931
He was developing her.

14
00:00:20,932 --> 00:00:22,037
You think you're clever?

15
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:23,049
You're working me?

16
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:25,049
- You still don't trust me.
- No. I don't.

17
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:27,049
- What the fuck was that?
- We had a plan.

18
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:29,050
Well, I think it succeeded.

19
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:31,049
The Agency's fucked.

20
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:33,049
Everyone's more concerned
with self-preservation

21
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:35,049
than they are with
gathering real intelligence.

22
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:37,049
Your behavior is reckless
and self-serving,

23
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:40,049
and I swear to God, if this shit
continues, Steven, I'll...

24
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:41,049
You will what?

25
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:44,049
Your support would be
a huge gain for Tel Aviv.

26
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:47,049
Name your price. Money's no object.

27
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:50,049
- You're an asshole.
- Hey, come on.

28
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,223
I still love you.

29
00:00:51,877 --> 00:00:53,049
Hector loves me.

30
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:54,049
You love him?

31
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:55,049
Of course I do.

32
00:00:56,185 --> 00:00:57,231
Shit.

34
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:08,049
That money that you gave to losava

35
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:11,049
is being used to smuggle
young girls into Syria,

36
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:13,049
where they will be raped and beaten

37
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:16,049
and raped again
for the rest of their lives.

38
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:18,049
You no longer have
the luxury of options.

39
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:19,049
You will stay and play

40
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:21,049
and you will force losava's hand.

41
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:24,049
You listen to me.
This will never happen again.

42
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:27,050
Do you hear me? Never.

43
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:46,049
You can keep that one.

44
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:47,050
Can I get all the other files
back, please?

45
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:51,049
Are we all here?

46
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:55,049
All right. We believe that Aleksandre

47
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,049
and Ruth losava are running
an underground route

48
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:59,049
from Germany into Syria

49
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:01,049
for young girls to marry ISIL fighters.

50
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:04,049
He's funding it
through his refugee foundation,

51
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:06,049
and she's recruiting the girls.

52
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:10,049
Now you want Cologne to approve
a large-scale operation

53
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:12,049
because he's sending underage girls

54
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:13,049
to be married in the desert?

55
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:16,049
We can't always be chasing
ticking bombs.

56
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:18,049
One day, those girls will return

57
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:20,049
to their families in Germany.

58
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:22,049
They are ticking bombs.

59
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:23,049
Cologne might hear that argument.

60
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:25,049
You can give Cologne that file there,

61
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:26,890
show them the intercepts
that link losava

62
00:03:26,891 --> 00:03:29,049
directly to Abu Bakr
al-Baghdadi, the head of Daesh.

63
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:32,049
Then, of course,
Cologne will ask if you should

64
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:34,049
expect Thomas Shaw
to expose the operation.

65
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:37,049
Well, uh, that's why we're meeting here

66
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,049
in your shielded room, and that's why

67
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:41,049
I have personally chosen
the participants.

68
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:44,049
Our primary objective is to discover

69
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:46,049
losava's underground route into Syria.

70
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:48,049
We know Berlin to Istanbul.

71
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:50,049
Once they've admitted
to shipping people,

72
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:53,049
you can make the arrests,
and we'll ask them ourselves.

73
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:57,049
To that end, our agent, Bora Osman,

74
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:59,049
has established contact,

75
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:01,049
and he's asked losava

76
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:04,049
to send one of his relatives to Syria.

77
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:05,049
Bora.

78
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:07,049
losava agreed to this?

79
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:09,770
Without saying the words aloud, yes.

80
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:28,049
losava wants to take possession
of one of our officers

81
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:31,049
at Boulevard Berlin's food court.

82
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:32,049
He thinks it's safe.

83
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:34,049
Noise, crowds, distractions...

84
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:37,049
He thinks he can get away if necessary.

85
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:39,049
However, half of the crowd will be ours.

86
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:41,049
How many people do we need?

87
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:42,049
We're looking at 100.

88
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:43,049
And how many are you supplying?

89
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:45,049
20, and our agent.

90
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:47,049
- Clare Itani.
- Yes.

91
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:50,049
She will be acting
as the ISIL bride to be.

92
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:52,049
50/50.

93
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:54,049
Hans didn't give us backup last time.

94
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:57,049
Now we're asking for a lot more
with a smaller window.

95
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:59,731
He won't fight for it.

96
00:04:59,756 --> 00:05:01,049
You look worried.

97
00:05:01,408 --> 00:05:04,049
I'm not worried about you.

98
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:05,342
I'm worried about the losavas

99
00:05:05,343 --> 00:05:08,049
once you get your hands
on their sorry asses.

100
00:05:09,662 --> 00:05:12,049
We've never met her before.
Is she convincing?

101
00:05:13,216 --> 00:05:14,652
Utterly.

102
00:05:14,653 --> 00:05:16,049
You want her to bring weapons?

103
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:18,049
Yes. Sidearms.

104
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:19,757
We will be armed.

105
00:05:19,758 --> 00:05:22,049
I'm not sure Cologne will
approve them for you.

106
00:05:22,809 --> 00:05:25,327
Now, as far as division of labor,

107
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:30,049
Hans and Steven will be in
the security room at the mall.

108
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:33,049
Johnson is technical point.

109
00:05:33,654 --> 00:05:36,049
And we've asked Esther
to run the German team

110
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:38,049
and Daniel to run the U.S. team.

111
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:40,049
We'll be in the food court,
but we'll keep bodies

112
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:43,049
around the perimeter
in case we need to move.

113
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:44,049
I suggest you do the same.

114
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:46,049
Yeah. Genius.

115
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:49,049
I'll be on the floor
with them, and Robert will have

116
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:51,049
his team at the north entrance
next to the parking garage.

117
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:54,049
We could cover the main
and west entrances.

118
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:57,049
Question... This is 36 hours away,

119
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:59,049
which barely gives us time to set it up.

120
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:00,401
Is that a question?

121
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:02,049
Sorry, it is not.

122
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:06,309
Well, we have no choice but to
follow losava's, uh, schedule.

123
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:10,049
I mean, it's tricky, but, uh,
it's not impossible.

124
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:13,049
And if it fails... Someone is hurt

125
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:15,049
or anything goes wrong,

126
00:06:15,743 --> 00:06:17,705
is there a cover story ready?

127
00:06:17,706 --> 00:06:19,766
Rival Islamic factions.

128
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,049
We'll take this up with Cologne,

129
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:24,050
and I'll have an answer by morning.

130
00:06:33,234 --> 00:06:35,519
Did you look into
the information I gave you?

131
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:38,736
No.

132
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:41,535
But I did look up Viktor Krug.

133
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:44,049
Stasi colonel.

134
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,049
I bet he was a wonderful father.

135
00:06:48,006 --> 00:06:49,049
He was responsible for the assassination

136
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:52,508
of at least five exiles
in London and Bonn.

137
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:54,049
At home, he raided houses

138
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:56,049
because people read the wrong books.

139
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:58,049
I'll bet he kept that secret.

140
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:01,049
When you have a home,
you do anything to protect it.

141
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:03,050
But you must have a home first, Daniel.

142
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:13,049
Now, that went well.

143
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:15,049
Well, I still have to
hash it out with Cologne,

144
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:17,049
so let's not pat ourselves
on the back till tomorrow.

145
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:19,657
I think Esther's right.
It's not enough time.

146
00:07:19,658 --> 00:07:21,049
We should be waiting for later shipment.

147
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:23,521
This may be the only shipment
we ever know about.

148
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:25,049
That's not a reason.

149
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:26,518
If it wasn't Clare?

150
00:07:27,336 --> 00:07:29,049
I'd have exactly the same reservations.

151
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:32,049
Oh, Christ, Valerie,
we always have reservations.

152
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:33,827
That's what we do.

153
00:07:44,284 --> 00:07:45,676
Good.

154
00:08:04,687 --> 00:08:05,686
Yeah.

155
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:32,513
We knew there would be repercussions.

156
00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:36,481
You can't punish these people.
It doesn't work.

157
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:39,547
But that's what you know, isn't it?

158
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:42,075
Punishment and reward?

159
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:44,843
No.

160
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:47,615
You and me, too.

161
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:51,050
We met at the end of your fist.

162
00:08:54,888 --> 00:08:57,049
Tell me that this is all
heading somewhere,

163
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:58,313
and I'll stay with you.

164
00:08:59,376 --> 00:09:02,050
It's all heading somewhere.

165
00:09:05,571 --> 00:09:07,049
Mm.

166
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:08,119
How's Hans?

167
00:09:09,301 --> 00:09:11,076
Sends his love.

168
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:14,533
You're up late.

169
00:09:15,236 --> 00:09:17,049
So, did you call the director's office?

170
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:18,049
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm?

171
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:20,049
It's between me and another person.

172
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:22,049
- Who?
- I don't know.

173
00:09:22,349 --> 00:09:25,049
My inside man thinks
telling half a secret

174
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:26,762
makes him coy or something.

175
00:09:27,718 --> 00:09:32,049
But he did say that if I can
pull this off, the desk is mine.

176
00:09:32,462 --> 00:09:34,186
And will you pull it off?

177
00:09:35,282 --> 00:09:36,681
Of course.

178
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:41,050
I'll get you a glass, then.

179
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:05,049
This Houjin Lin operation was
an eye opener, Robert.

180
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:08,049
It corroborated
some intelligence we picked up

181
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:09,049
in Beijing.

182
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:11,049
What kind of intelligence was that?

183
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:14,049
You made some important people
in Tel Aviv very happy.

184
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:16,049
They want to set you up
with a retirement account.

185
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:18,049
I told you I don't want that.

186
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:20,146
Then stop making them nervous.

187
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:22,815
Tell me what you want.

188
00:10:22,816 --> 00:10:25,835
What I need from you
is the same kind of help

189
00:10:25,836 --> 00:10:27,049
you're getting from me.

190
00:10:27,572 --> 00:10:30,049
I don't want to fester and die

191
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:32,049
in one deputy slot after another.

192
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:35,460
I need some serious
fucking intelligence, Golda.

193
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:37,721
Better yet, a recruitment.

194
00:10:37,722 --> 00:10:39,798
You want us to run a dangle into you?

195
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:41,049
Fake your way to the top?

196
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:44,036
How do you think most
of my bosses got their jobs?

197
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:48,557
I need to start flying
at Steven's altitude.

198
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:54,809
And if this operation
against losava goes forward,

199
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:57,049
that would get you moving, wouldn't it?

200
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:59,049
Steven Frost rises to Deputy Director

201
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:00,808
and gives you the station you want.

202
00:11:00,809 --> 00:11:02,049
No, no, no, no.

203
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:04,063
I don't want a station.

204
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:08,049
I follow him to Washington,

205
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:09,713
being right in the heart of it,

206
00:11:09,714 --> 00:11:11,772
right in the thick of it at Langley.

207
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:20,050
You want to be nearer
to your son, Robert, don't you?

208
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:28,049
You came to us because you were
very angry with Steven Frost.

209
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:29,519
You still are.

210
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:31,049
But here's my counsel.

211
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:33,049
Do not show your anger.

212
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:35,580
Let him keep you under his wing.

213
00:11:35,581 --> 00:11:39,335
Help him with this,
and ride with him back home.

214
00:11:39,868 --> 00:11:42,867
We both know this is
his last chance to make his mark

215
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:44,867
if he wants to become Deputy Director.

216
00:11:45,506 --> 00:11:47,868
Let's make sure he succeeds.

217
00:12:17,358 --> 00:12:18,868
Ingrid.

218
00:14:10,868 --> 00:14:12,867
You have your approval.

219
00:14:13,868 --> 00:14:14,867
Thank you.

220
00:14:15,236 --> 00:14:17,509
But no guns for you.

221
00:14:18,727 --> 00:14:19,948
And our deal?

222
00:14:20,868 --> 00:14:21,867
You get Dieter Klaus's file.

223
00:14:21,868 --> 00:14:25,118
Everything you shared with us...
four years of it.

224
00:14:26,868 --> 00:14:28,015
Hans.

225
00:14:30,382 --> 00:14:33,596
No one can find out
that I gave it to you.

226
00:14:33,597 --> 00:14:34,868
No one.

227
00:14:45,327 --> 00:14:46,524
So?

228
00:14:48,169 --> 00:14:49,867
It's on.

229
00:14:49,868 --> 00:14:50,867
Weapons?

230
00:14:50,868 --> 00:14:53,359
No. No weapons.

231
00:14:54,395 --> 00:14:56,073
This is it, then?

232
00:14:57,442 --> 00:14:59,868
I'll start rounding up the troops.

233
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:12,868
Sandra, is Daniel in the station?

234
00:15:36,868 --> 00:15:41,867
So. The developments?

235
00:15:41,868 --> 00:15:43,458
What do you mean?

236
00:15:43,868 --> 00:15:46,740
You had Julian De Vos' file for a week.

237
00:15:47,868 --> 00:15:49,867
And you said
you would get me information

238
00:15:49,868 --> 00:15:51,867
on the black site he escaped from.

239
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:54,867
Getting the file put eyes on me.

240
00:15:54,868 --> 00:15:56,868
I've had to move very carefully.

241
00:15:58,868 --> 00:16:00,449
I'd like a time frame.

242
00:16:01,426 --> 00:16:04,740
What would help is
the black-site information.

243
00:16:05,868 --> 00:16:08,867
Julian De Vos will lead me
to Thomas Shaw.

244
00:16:09,113 --> 00:16:10,673
<i>Us.</i>

245
00:16:11,868 --> 00:16:14,867
<i>I have a meeting
with Ingrid Hollander today.</i>

246
00:16:15,258 --> 00:16:17,867
- Shaw's reporter?
- No, that's too risky.

247
00:16:18,243 --> 00:16:19,689
Where are you meeting her?

248
00:16:21,299 --> 00:16:22,867
I'll give you a report afterward.

249
00:16:22,868 --> 00:16:23,867
Yeah.

250
00:16:23,868 --> 00:16:26,867
You know, I-I don't know what you think

251
00:16:26,868 --> 00:16:28,699
your position is at this point.

252
00:16:30,326 --> 00:16:32,868
You're a ship without a harbor, buddy.

253
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:38,867
You don't want to do this alone,
Daniel. Particularly now.

254
00:16:38,868 --> 00:16:42,867
One more Shaw leak, and
all our jobs are in jeopardy.

255
00:16:43,409 --> 00:16:44,867
<i>You know, once upon a time,</i>

256
00:16:44,868 --> 00:16:46,867
<i>Shaw, he'd leak Agency misdeeds
all over the world,</i>

257
00:16:46,868 --> 00:16:49,867
<i>but he has hit this station
three times in a row.</i>

258
00:16:50,667 --> 00:16:52,563
What's his beef against us?

259
00:16:54,252 --> 00:16:56,292
Maybe he has a problem with you.

260
00:16:57,868 --> 00:16:59,867
He wants to ship all of us home.

261
00:17:01,868 --> 00:17:04,867
<i>We have to shore up our
credibility with headquarters</i>

262
00:17:05,267 --> 00:17:06,867
<i>before the next attack.</i>

263
00:17:07,468 --> 00:17:09,867
One sec.

264
00:17:10,357 --> 00:17:13,868
I forgot how ugly your stairwell is!

265
00:17:17,868 --> 00:17:18,867
Hey.

266
00:17:18,868 --> 00:17:19,867
Hey, you gonna let me in?

267
00:17:19,868 --> 00:17:21,867
I-I-I-I didn't know you were coming.

268
00:17:21,868 --> 00:17:23,867
Oh, oh. We're announcing ourselves now?

269
00:17:23,868 --> 00:17:26,868
Well, I just wanted
to tell you that, um...

270
00:17:28,868 --> 00:17:30,867
Got it.

271
00:17:30,868 --> 00:17:32,867
N-No, not exactly. No, you haven't.

272
00:17:32,868 --> 00:17:34,867
Exclusivity was never our thing.

273
00:17:34,868 --> 00:17:36,868
Will I see you later?

274
00:17:52,314 --> 00:17:55,867
You've never moved this fast
before, Steven. Why the rush?

275
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:58,017
Opportunity was on the table.

276
00:17:59,105 --> 00:18:01,008
You always have opportunities.

277
00:18:02,868 --> 00:18:04,867
Do you know what headquarters
thinks of us?

278
00:18:05,206 --> 00:18:06,867
They don't.

279
00:18:06,868 --> 00:18:08,867
Forget all the work
we've done over the years.

280
00:18:09,342 --> 00:18:10,867
We're dealing with ADHD over there.

281
00:18:10,868 --> 00:18:12,867
We're a litmus test.

282
00:18:12,868 --> 00:18:15,349
How many hits does it take
for Shaw to kill a station?

283
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:17,867
We got lucky with Houjin Lin,
but luck never holds.

284
00:18:17,868 --> 00:18:21,867
So, we need to remind them who we are

285
00:18:21,868 --> 00:18:23,358
and what the fuck we do here.

286
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:25,867
And we need a win. We need a win.

287
00:18:25,868 --> 00:18:26,867
If... If we want to succeed in this,

288
00:18:26,868 --> 00:18:28,867
we all have to stand together.

289
00:18:28,868 --> 00:18:29,867
Need a win?

290
00:18:29,868 --> 00:18:31,867
Stand together?

291
00:18:33,526 --> 00:18:35,235
Anybody reaching for that many cliches

292
00:18:35,236 --> 00:18:36,867
sounds like they're hiding something.

293
00:18:36,868 --> 00:18:38,867
Oh, come on, Valerie. Are you
hiding something, Steven?

294
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:40,868
Jesus. God.

295
00:18:44,175 --> 00:18:46,143
Oh, my God.

296
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,867
This is about Jemma Moore's
desk, isn't it?

297
00:18:51,312 --> 00:18:54,155
This has nothing to do with
losava, does it?

298
00:18:54,351 --> 00:18:56,867
Good Christ, Steven.

299
00:18:56,868 --> 00:18:58,867
You used to care about the human cost.

300
00:18:58,868 --> 00:19:00,867
You used to care
about the repercussions...

301
00:19:00,868 --> 00:19:02,867
You are so goddamn detached.

302
00:19:02,868 --> 00:19:05,867
- Excuse me?
- Gerald and Clare...

303
00:19:05,868 --> 00:19:06,867
They're not our friends,
they're our colleagues,

304
00:19:06,868 --> 00:19:08,867
and when you mistake them for friends,

305
00:19:08,868 --> 00:19:10,136
you undermine your work,

306
00:19:10,137 --> 00:19:13,148
and you've been undermining it
for a very long time.

307
00:19:32,868 --> 00:19:34,867
Okay, so you want to know who it was?

308
00:19:34,868 --> 00:19:36,380
Not really?

309
00:19:36,405 --> 00:19:38,867
Friend of mine got beat up,
and, um, I-I...

310
00:19:38,868 --> 00:19:39,867
Stop, okay?

311
00:19:39,868 --> 00:19:42,867
I just wanted to get in
a good fuck before the op.

312
00:19:42,868 --> 00:19:44,360
Op? What op?

313
00:19:44,361 --> 00:19:46,867
If you don't know,
you're not supposed to know.

314
00:19:46,868 --> 00:19:47,867
Tell me.

315
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:51,867
I'm a bride for the Caliphate.
That's the setup.

316
00:19:51,868 --> 00:19:54,256
Get a confession, and we finally
bring down losava.

317
00:19:54,811 --> 00:19:56,867
And if he doesn't confess?

318
00:19:57,313 --> 00:19:59,642
Then I'm on a plane to Istanbul.

319
00:20:00,868 --> 00:20:02,867
That's insane. You're not doing it.

320
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:03,867
What else should I do with my time?

321
00:20:03,868 --> 00:20:05,867
Take a fucking break.

322
00:20:06,222 --> 00:20:07,867
Go back to being a grad student.

323
00:20:07,868 --> 00:20:09,366
You think that's real?

324
00:20:09,868 --> 00:20:10,867
No, Hector.

325
00:20:10,868 --> 00:20:12,867
An hour ago, I was a graduate student.

326
00:20:13,394 --> 00:20:16,045
Now I'm a CIA officer
under non-official cover.

327
00:20:16,608 --> 00:20:18,867
You should see what I am
around my parents.

328
00:20:21,114 --> 00:20:29,706
All of them, they're roles.

329
00:20:30,089 --> 00:20:33,867
Okay, so when was
this operation decided on?

330
00:20:34,193 --> 00:20:36,867
Idea's been floating around for days.

331
00:20:36,868 --> 00:20:39,328
Val and I got the call this morning.

332
00:20:39,868 --> 00:20:41,614
It's tomorrow.

333
00:20:42,868 --> 00:20:44,867
Tomorrow? Fuck that.

334
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:46,441
It's fine.

335
00:20:50,868 --> 00:20:53,868
- You'll be alone tonight?
- I hope not.

336
00:21:13,868 --> 00:21:15,509
What the fuck, Valerie?

337
00:21:16,868 --> 00:21:18,868
You want to shut that door?

338
00:21:20,675 --> 00:21:21,867
She gets back from Saudi

339
00:21:21,868 --> 00:21:24,713
and you immediately want
to risk her neck?

340
00:21:26,164 --> 00:21:27,867
No.

341
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:31,306
But the Verfassungsschutz
approved it a few hours ago.

342
00:21:31,307 --> 00:21:32,867
Right, so it's in Hans Richter's hands.

343
00:21:32,868 --> 00:21:33,867
I'll talk to him.

344
00:21:33,868 --> 00:21:35,867
You expose yourself to
Hans Richter, and you are out.

345
00:21:35,868 --> 00:21:38,867
Oh, come on. You think he
doesn't already know who I am?

346
00:21:38,868 --> 00:21:40,868
- Fuck it.
- Stop!

347
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:44,867
I have done, and I will continue to do

348
00:21:44,868 --> 00:21:48,867
everything in my power to
make sure that this works out.

349
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:51,187
Okay, I'm in. Sign me up.

350
00:21:53,868 --> 00:21:55,867
Frost is not gonna declare you to Hans.

351
00:21:55,868 --> 00:21:58,867
You have way too many cases
we can't expose to the Germans.

352
00:21:58,868 --> 00:22:00,867
Then I won't show myself
to the fucking Germans.

353
00:22:00,868 --> 00:22:03,867
And you are involved with Clare.

354
00:22:03,868 --> 00:22:06,867
I am not risking your emotions.
It is out of the question.

355
00:22:06,868 --> 00:22:09,867
Okay, who's running point?

356
00:22:09,868 --> 00:22:10,867
Daniel.

357
00:22:10,868 --> 00:22:11,867
Fucking Daniel?

358
00:22:11,868 --> 00:22:13,868
You have a problem with him?

359
00:22:23,634 --> 00:22:25,953
You make sure
your hat's screwed on right.

360
00:22:27,032 --> 00:22:28,867
Do not fuck this up.

361
00:22:29,291 --> 00:22:30,867
We're covering all contingencies.

362
00:22:30,868 --> 00:22:32,868
Clare is going to be fine.

363
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,867
Azar Gulek.

364
00:22:46,868 --> 00:22:48,916
My nephew's wife.

365
00:22:49,627 --> 00:22:50,867
From Saray.

366
00:22:50,868 --> 00:22:53,090
Iranian family.

367
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:55,660
Azar married...

368
00:22:57,868 --> 00:22:58,868
Huseyin.

369
00:23:01,396 --> 00:23:02,867
Huseyin.

370
00:23:03,323 --> 00:23:06,868
Huseyin fought in Raqqa with the...

371
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,867
I can't do it.

372
00:23:10,868 --> 00:23:12,260
Yes, you can.

373
00:23:13,868 --> 00:23:16,867
This is crazy.

374
00:23:16,868 --> 00:23:18,509
It's not, Bora.

375
00:23:19,132 --> 00:23:20,867
I have a family.

376
00:23:21,356 --> 00:23:23,764
Your family is why you'll do this.

377
00:23:24,868 --> 00:23:28,563
My parents fled Iran
because of people like losava.

378
00:23:29,092 --> 00:23:30,867
They trekked across the world

379
00:23:30,868 --> 00:23:31,867
just so they could walk down the street

380
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:35,756
and not worry about snipers
and public executions.

381
00:23:36,868 --> 00:23:39,867
People like losava
smear my family's culture

382
00:23:39,868 --> 00:23:42,236
and yours with blood.

383
00:23:44,117 --> 00:23:45,375
What kind of Islam

384
00:23:45,376 --> 00:23:47,867
do you want your children
to grow up with?

385
00:23:54,734 --> 00:23:55,734
Bora.

386
00:23:59,145 --> 00:24:00,867
Once again from the top.

387
00:24:05,868 --> 00:24:08,867
When I look at them, I see compromise,

388
00:24:09,705 --> 00:24:11,867
the whole fucking bunch of them.

389
00:24:12,201 --> 00:24:14,001
<i>Kompromiss.</i>

390
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:20,052
You know what my dad did
with his time on earth?

391
00:24:20,868 --> 00:24:23,234
He went on civil-rights marches,

392
00:24:24,209 --> 00:24:27,173
stopped whaling boats
with his own two hands,

393
00:24:28,063 --> 00:24:29,867
ambushed cops in Kent State,

394
00:24:29,868 --> 00:24:34,867
drank himself through the mad,
nasty fucking '70s.

395
00:24:34,868 --> 00:24:36,867
Never took no for an answer.

396
00:24:37,265 --> 00:24:38,868
Never said no.

397
00:24:44,868 --> 00:24:46,844
What's that?

398
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:50,328
All the details of Clare's operation.

399
00:24:50,329 --> 00:24:51,609
There's no time

400
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:53,867
if you want Ingrid Hollander
to publish tomorrow.

401
00:24:54,138 --> 00:24:55,492
As soon as she pulls it up,

402
00:24:55,493 --> 00:24:57,548
they'll have no choice but to abort.

403
00:24:59,868 --> 00:25:01,830
I'm gonna take it to her.

404
00:25:02,868 --> 00:25:04,867
That's not the system. Give it to me.

405
00:25:04,868 --> 00:25:07,868
You already broke
the fucking system, Julian.

406
00:25:10,868 --> 00:25:12,854
You have a choice, Hector.

407
00:25:13,667 --> 00:25:15,666
You deliver it yourself,

408
00:25:15,868 --> 00:25:17,867
break our system, and you'll be caught.

409
00:25:18,024 --> 00:25:19,867
It's all over for you.

410
00:25:20,184 --> 00:25:21,868
So, why don't you sleep on it?

411
00:25:52,368 --> 00:25:53,867
Who are we visiting?

412
00:25:53,868 --> 00:25:55,867
Gheorgi Codreanu.

413
00:25:56,375 --> 00:25:59,867
Some Afghans paid him to smuggle
heroin across the Black Sea.

414
00:26:00,413 --> 00:26:02,867
Yes, terrorists.

415
00:26:03,245 --> 00:26:05,867
Gheorgi Codreanu?

416
00:26:06,102 --> 00:26:07,868
You wrote an article about him, right?

417
00:26:13,221 --> 00:26:14,868
Hello, Ingrid.

418
00:26:20,868 --> 00:26:22,868
Hello, Gheorgi.

419
00:26:29,697 --> 00:26:30,697
<i>Ja.</i>

420
00:26:32,567 --> 00:26:33,867
They have him on clozapine.

421
00:26:34,687 --> 00:26:37,867
If they don't tie him up,
he'll scratch his eyes out.

422
00:26:38,687 --> 00:26:41,867
The CIA tortured him
for information he didn't have.

423
00:26:42,324 --> 00:26:45,867
When he was finally released,
he lost his mind.

424
00:26:46,518 --> 00:26:49,868
He was a criminal, not a terrorist.

425
00:27:01,868 --> 00:27:02,868
Hey.

426
00:27:08,868 --> 00:27:10,649
He doesn't know him. Let's go.

427
00:27:13,868 --> 00:27:15,868
Julian.

428
00:27:28,868 --> 00:27:31,867
That's what your CIA does to people.

429
00:27:31,868 --> 00:27:34,867
That is the end point
of your foreign policy...

430
00:27:34,868 --> 00:27:36,867
broken people tied to beds.

431
00:27:36,868 --> 00:27:39,405
This is why Thomas Shaw does
what he does.

432
00:27:40,756 --> 00:27:42,868
Why do you think Shaw
came to you in the first place?

433
00:27:45,036 --> 00:27:47,213
Because of the article you wrote.

434
00:27:48,246 --> 00:27:52,506
That man was in the same prison
as Julian De Vos.

435
00:27:53,868 --> 00:27:55,324
Look at him.

436
00:27:56,868 --> 00:27:58,867
He killed Claudia.

437
00:27:58,868 --> 00:28:01,867
Shaw brought this monster
into your life.

438
00:28:02,448 --> 00:28:04,421
You don't know that.

439
00:28:05,868 --> 00:28:07,669
I think we both know it's true.

440
00:28:08,868 --> 00:28:11,868
Just get off my fucking computer.

441
00:29:13,224 --> 00:29:15,867
Come on, you can
do better than that. Tell me.

442
00:29:15,868 --> 00:29:17,867
Woke up, you went to school,
you came home.

443
00:29:17,868 --> 00:29:19,867
That's all you got for me?

444
00:29:20,575 --> 00:29:23,868
Hey, I'm working on coming home.

445
00:29:36,868 --> 00:29:39,867
No.

446
00:29:40,673 --> 00:29:42,531
That's the spirit.

447
00:29:43,868 --> 00:29:45,867
Come on. Call in sick.

448
00:29:45,868 --> 00:29:48,867
What time is it?

449
00:29:48,868 --> 00:29:49,867
Ugh. I got to go.

450
00:29:49,868 --> 00:29:52,868
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

451
00:29:58,681 --> 00:30:00,868
You want me to make
an honest man of you?

452
00:30:03,868 --> 00:30:06,868
Maybe I just want you to support
my bad habits.

453
00:30:09,471 --> 00:30:12,867
I have a box of Euro I've been
holding onto for a long time.

454
00:30:13,558 --> 00:30:15,191
Illicit cash?

455
00:30:15,868 --> 00:30:18,263
Keep us going for a year.

456
00:30:19,868 --> 00:30:21,823
You're crazy.

457
00:30:22,868 --> 00:30:23,868
I know.

458
00:30:34,868 --> 00:30:36,024
Good morning.

459
00:30:36,868 --> 00:30:38,867
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

460
00:30:46,209 --> 00:30:48,260
I was dreaming about water.

461
00:30:48,868 --> 00:30:50,867
That should mean something.

462
00:30:53,252 --> 00:30:54,892
Thank you.

463
00:30:55,868 --> 00:30:56,868
Sit.

464
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:11,261
40 years.

465
00:31:12,868 --> 00:31:16,277
40 years I've been in this agency.

466
00:31:18,922 --> 00:31:21,009
Since 1976.

467
00:31:21,868 --> 00:31:23,034
Jimmy Carter.

468
00:31:23,604 --> 00:31:24,867
We landed on Mars.

469
00:31:24,868 --> 00:31:27,449
Uh, Soweto uprising.

470
00:31:27,868 --> 00:31:30,055
Red China, Soviets.

471
00:31:30,868 --> 00:31:31,867
Wow.

472
00:31:32,281 --> 00:31:35,868
Everything seems just
so black and white, you know?

473
00:31:38,465 --> 00:31:41,867
And that's bullshit. The world's
always been complicated.

474
00:31:42,251 --> 00:31:43,867
It's youth.

475
00:31:43,868 --> 00:31:45,867
I see it in my daughter.

476
00:31:46,234 --> 00:31:49,353
You know, she's black, white,
black, white.

477
00:31:50,255 --> 00:31:52,980
And you grow up,
and you learn the truth.

478
00:31:54,211 --> 00:31:56,867
There's hard decisions
and harder decisions.

479
00:32:03,137 --> 00:32:05,210
Oh, Sandra, I don't know.

480
00:32:06,274 --> 00:32:08,868
I don't know if I made the right one.

481
00:32:12,415 --> 00:32:14,867
They're just decisions, Steven.

482
00:32:15,262 --> 00:32:18,142
You live with them, move on.

483
00:32:19,398 --> 00:32:21,868
It's what the rest of us do.

484
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:39,317
Come on, stay.

485
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:41,868
I'm going.

486
00:32:51,324 --> 00:32:53,115
Playing a widow today.

487
00:32:53,868 --> 00:32:55,180
I need a wedding ring.

488
00:32:56,274 --> 00:32:57,867
Have it.

489
00:33:03,688 --> 00:33:05,867
I could stop this, you know.

490
00:33:05,868 --> 00:33:07,044
How?

491
00:33:07,868 --> 00:33:09,435
I have my ways.

492
00:33:09,868 --> 00:33:13,867
You keep at this, we're done. I mean it.

493
00:33:13,868 --> 00:33:15,188
You're infantilizing me.

494
00:33:15,189 --> 00:33:16,867
I'm trying to protect you.

495
00:33:17,051 --> 00:33:18,867
I don't need protection.

496
00:33:18,868 --> 00:33:21,319
What I need is a little respect, okay?

497
00:33:22,444 --> 00:33:24,867
I'll see you tonight.

498
00:34:17,023 --> 00:34:18,867
Eyes?

499
00:34:18,868 --> 00:34:19,867
One, check.

500
00:34:19,868 --> 00:34:20,867
Two, check.

501
00:34:23,496 --> 00:34:24,867
<i>Danke schon.</i>

502
00:34:24,868 --> 00:34:26,868
Check, three.

503
00:34:33,356 --> 00:34:35,061
Try the Chinese.

504
00:34:35,868 --> 00:34:38,867
Boy, you really do
take your life in your hands.

505
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:42,293
Please. Necessary communication only.

506
00:34:44,356 --> 00:34:46,868
Let's hope this is worth
the trade, Steven.

507
00:34:50,935 --> 00:34:52,867
Check.

508
00:34:52,868 --> 00:34:54,868
Three, take your position.

509
00:34:56,868 --> 00:34:57,867
Visual on first.

510
00:34:57,868 --> 00:34:59,868
Check.

511
00:35:09,401 --> 00:35:11,257
To your left.

512
00:35:13,868 --> 00:35:15,867
Who has visual on the package?

513
00:35:15,868 --> 00:35:17,867
One, negative.

514
00:35:17,868 --> 00:35:20,150
Two, negative.

515
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:22,867
Standby, eight.

516
00:35:22,868 --> 00:35:24,868
Check.

517
00:35:27,868 --> 00:35:30,149
Your hosts are in position.

518
00:35:40,407 --> 00:35:42,398
What the fuck are you doing here?

519
00:35:42,868 --> 00:35:43,867
My job.

520
00:35:43,868 --> 00:35:47,868
Sir, uh... DeJean is here.

521
00:35:49,868 --> 00:35:50,867
Hector DeJean?

522
00:35:50,868 --> 00:35:52,867
Your assistant cultural attache?

523
00:35:52,868 --> 00:35:54,186
Can we get him out of there?

524
00:35:54,187 --> 00:35:55,867
Not without showing our hand.

525
00:35:55,868 --> 00:35:58,867
Is there something you want
to tell me about Mr. DeJean?

526
00:35:58,868 --> 00:36:02,868
I told you I had this. I know.

527
00:36:07,868 --> 00:36:09,806
You stay away from her.

528
00:36:11,868 --> 00:36:13,797
Never trust the Germans.

529
00:36:15,325 --> 00:36:17,867
We have a visual on Fawn and Swingset.

530
00:36:17,868 --> 00:36:19,868
Fawn and Swingset approaching.

531
00:36:31,422 --> 00:36:33,867
Package approaching escalator two.

532
00:36:33,868 --> 00:36:35,867
I have a visual.

533
00:36:36,591 --> 00:36:37,867
Visual on first.

534
00:36:38,621 --> 00:36:40,330
Two, check.

535
00:36:40,868 --> 00:36:41,867
Check.

536
00:36:41,868 --> 00:36:44,867
I've got eyes on Fawn and Swingset.

537
00:36:44,868 --> 00:36:47,075
You've got this, okay?

538
00:36:49,868 --> 00:36:50,867
This better be working.

539
00:36:50,868 --> 00:36:52,867
Someone please tell her it's working.

540
00:36:52,868 --> 00:36:54,868
Two, check.

541
00:37:04,469 --> 00:37:05,867
What the fuck?

542
00:37:05,868 --> 00:37:08,868
Swingset is entering
second floor bathroom.

543
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,868
Hold on. Hector.

544
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,868
Hey, Bora.

545
00:37:30,454 --> 00:37:31,867
Listen to me.

546
00:37:31,868 --> 00:37:33,867
When you bring a girl to the dance,

547
00:37:33,868 --> 00:37:35,867
you don't just fucking leave her.

548
00:37:35,868 --> 00:37:37,867
Now, I'm not playing around, Bora.

549
00:37:37,868 --> 00:37:39,867
You see, I happen
to love that woman out there,

550
00:37:39,868 --> 00:37:41,867
and if you fuck this up for her,

551
00:37:41,868 --> 00:37:45,868
I'm gonna have to drag you down
into my basement.

552
00:37:46,868 --> 00:37:48,867
Be advised, package has arrived

553
00:37:48,868 --> 00:37:51,868
in early model blue U.S. mini van.

554
00:38:04,626 --> 00:38:06,417
Flamingo and four friends.

555
00:38:06,519 --> 00:38:08,519
Where the fuck is her husband?

556
00:38:16,176 --> 00:38:19,867
Bora Osman disappears
and losava sends his wife?

557
00:38:20,444 --> 00:38:22,182
You better get control of this, Steven.

558
00:38:22,183 --> 00:38:24,867
Flamingo en route to
second floor via escalator two.

559
00:38:25,711 --> 00:38:28,868
Be advised...
Swingset is not on his mark.

560
00:38:35,868 --> 00:38:37,868
Where's Flamingo?

561
00:38:41,401 --> 00:38:43,867
On her way up to level two.

562
00:38:43,868 --> 00:38:44,868
Shit.

563
00:38:49,598 --> 00:38:51,218
He's back.

564
00:38:52,868 --> 00:38:55,867
Flamingo and friends
are approaching food court.

565
00:38:55,868 --> 00:38:57,868
Be advised... two of them are armed.

566
00:39:22,868 --> 00:39:24,867
<i>Frau losava.</i>

567
00:39:24,868 --> 00:39:27,429
<i>Meine</i> niece, Azar Gulek.

568
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:29,867
I am sorry, but her German is...

569
00:39:30,251 --> 00:39:32,867
I not speak the German.

570
00:39:32,868 --> 00:39:34,867
You are beautiful, Azar.

571
00:39:35,476 --> 00:39:37,350
He sent his wife?

572
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:40,603
Eyes on me. Fuck you.

573
00:39:40,604 --> 00:39:41,867
Eyes on me.

574
00:39:41,868 --> 00:39:44,674
Bora told us about your husband.

575
00:39:45,868 --> 00:39:48,360
I'm sorry. Yes.

576
00:39:48,868 --> 00:39:51,068
Huseyin. He die in battle.

577
00:39:52,113 --> 00:39:53,867
What was his profession?

578
00:39:54,219 --> 00:39:56,867
He work for his father.

579
00:39:56,868 --> 00:40:00,867
Cafe in Saray, near to Iran.

580
00:40:01,594 --> 00:40:06,867
He do not ask me for to marry
until he has buy a house.

581
00:40:07,442 --> 00:40:10,867
Our families know each other long time.

582
00:40:11,307 --> 00:40:12,868
Children?

583
00:40:16,868 --> 00:40:17,868
Azar?

584
00:40:20,365 --> 00:40:23,973
They arrest him, the government.

585
00:40:24,868 --> 00:40:26,867
Say he is terrorist.

586
00:40:27,582 --> 00:40:29,867
They say I am bad mother.

587
00:40:30,684 --> 00:40:34,867
Take my two sons to Ankara.

588
00:40:34,868 --> 00:40:36,133
And Huseyin?

589
00:40:36,704 --> 00:40:38,703
When he get out from prison,

590
00:40:38,868 --> 00:40:42,867
he want to take gun, go to Ankara.

591
00:40:43,469 --> 00:40:44,867
I say no.

592
00:40:45,116 --> 00:40:48,867
I tell him go to Syria for Caliphate.

593
00:40:48,868 --> 00:40:52,867
And then we go to Ankara, take our sons.

594
00:40:52,868 --> 00:40:54,865
Give them new life in Raqqa.

595
00:40:58,143 --> 00:40:59,633
Switching to Arabic.

596
00:41:05,868 --> 00:41:07,200
She's testing her.

597
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:16,787
Why is she here?

598
00:41:19,558 --> 00:41:21,868
She wants to...

599
00:41:34,286 --> 00:41:36,867
Is this true? Did you really try

600
00:41:36,868 --> 00:41:38,867
to bring the whole family to Germany?

601
00:41:39,152 --> 00:41:43,867
Bora is most generous man
I ever have to known.

602
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:47,867
This is why I come to Germany.

603
00:41:48,087 --> 00:41:52,867
After Huseyin die,
I know Bora is last good man

604
00:41:52,868 --> 00:41:54,124
in our family.

605
00:41:55,343 --> 00:41:58,975
And why do you want to leave?

606
00:42:00,807 --> 00:42:05,802
I... cannot take the Europe.

607
00:42:06,868 --> 00:42:10,867
I want I will fill Caliphate
with children.

608
00:42:10,868 --> 00:42:13,867
I want I will give strength
to young fighters.

609
00:42:13,868 --> 00:42:19,867
And someday, God willing,
we will go to Ankara.

610
00:42:20,847 --> 00:42:23,384
We get my sons back.

611
00:42:28,543 --> 00:42:33,928
My heart is warmed by
the passion in your performance.

612
00:42:35,961 --> 00:42:38,867
As soon as I saw your
pretty face from over there,

613
00:42:38,868 --> 00:42:40,767
I knew you were special.

614
00:42:41,868 --> 00:42:43,868
And familiar.

615
00:42:47,868 --> 00:42:51,867
You know Daayna and Sabina. Yes?

616
00:42:54,868 --> 00:42:57,867
I'm not going to get angry, child,

617
00:42:57,868 --> 00:42:59,867
because this isn't hatred.

618
00:42:59,868 --> 00:43:01,157
It's a war.

619
00:43:01,868 --> 00:43:03,867
My truth against your truth.

620
00:43:04,277 --> 00:43:06,633
Allah will grant one of us the victory,

621
00:43:06,634 --> 00:43:08,773
either the innocent or the guilty

622
00:43:08,774 --> 00:43:10,867
that kill mothers and children
on their way to market.

623
00:43:11,365 --> 00:43:13,867
In the meantime, we do our jobs.

624
00:43:15,437 --> 00:43:16,867
Golda.

625
00:43:16,868 --> 00:43:18,867
We had an agreement, oh son of Israel.

626
00:43:18,868 --> 00:43:19,867
Yes.

627
00:43:19,868 --> 00:43:21,306
You were going to tell me everything.

628
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:23,359
What are you talking about, Golda?

629
00:43:24,042 --> 00:43:26,867
Why did three men
just kidnap Aleksandre losava?

630
00:43:26,868 --> 00:43:27,867
What?

631
00:43:27,868 --> 00:43:29,867
You did not tell me about that.

632
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,867
The hell are you talking about, Golda?

633
00:43:34,673 --> 00:43:37,343
You have microphones, I'm sure,

634
00:43:37,344 --> 00:43:40,867
and I know better than to say
anything incriminating.

635
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:42,867
Instead, I will walk away.

636
00:43:42,868 --> 00:43:44,867
You will, too.

637
00:43:44,868 --> 00:43:46,867
Yeah.

638
00:43:46,868 --> 00:43:48,867
Call it off.
Get her the fuck out of there.

639
00:43:48,868 --> 00:43:51,196
Someone's nabbed losava off the street.

640
00:43:51,197 --> 00:43:53,103
We will see each other again.

641
00:43:53,868 --> 00:43:54,960
Not today.

642
00:44:01,868 --> 00:44:03,331
- Call it off.
- Sir?

643
00:44:03,332 --> 00:44:04,867
Get... Get them out of there now!

644
00:44:04,868 --> 00:44:06,073
Abort. Abort.

645
00:44:06,074 --> 00:44:07,214
- What's going on?
- Abort.

646
00:44:07,239 --> 00:44:08,867
You're coming with us,
or we will kill you both.

647
00:44:08,868 --> 00:44:10,868
- What?
- I repeat, abort.

648
00:44:19,868 --> 00:44:22,868
Keep eyes on the package. Do not engage.

649
00:44:47,868 --> 00:44:48,868
Shit!

650
00:45:21,868 --> 00:45:24,868
Bora?

651
00:45:44,868 --> 00:45:47,867
In pursuit... blue van, Berlin plate.

652
00:45:47,868 --> 00:45:51,868
Bravo-Walker-Alpha-2647.

653
00:46:33,097 --> 00:46:34,097
Fuck.

654
00:47:49,532 --> 00:47:51,941
What's your status? Do you have her?

655
00:47:52,868 --> 00:47:53,867
Negative.

656
00:47:54,321 --> 00:47:55,867
They're not in the van.

657
00:47:55,868 --> 00:47:57,867
They ran a bait and switch.

658
00:47:57,868 --> 00:47:59,208
The roof is clear.

659
00:47:59,868 --> 00:48:02,868
The perimeter is secure.
No signs of targets.

660
00:48:10,868 --> 00:48:12,703
Deputy Director.

661
00:48:13,868 --> 00:48:18,867
Um... well, tell who's ever
not at lunch that it's Berlin.

662
00:48:24,491 --> 00:48:26,867
What the fuck are you doing?

663
00:48:26,868 --> 00:48:28,867
A rendition
in the middle of an operation?

664
00:48:28,868 --> 00:48:29,867
What the fuck's the matter with you?

665
00:48:29,868 --> 00:48:32,091
What... why would...

666
00:48:33,868 --> 00:48:36,147
Don't give me that bullshit!

667
00:48:36,868 --> 00:48:39,867
Pass the buck. What the f...

668
00:48:40,499 --> 00:48:42,810
God, you don't know about it?!

669
00:48:43,868 --> 00:48:45,867
No, you listen to me, there are
people down everywhere.

670
00:48:45,868 --> 00:48:46,867
I don't know how many are dead.

671
00:48:46,868 --> 00:48:48,867
They shot a boy point blank.

672
00:48:48,868 --> 00:48:49,867
A boy.

673
00:48:50,483 --> 00:48:52,539
Okay, then who took them?

674
00:48:54,168 --> 00:48:57,170
Let me tell you something.

675
00:48:59,323 --> 00:49:02,867
I'm gonna get our officer back
if it's the last thing I do,

676
00:49:02,868 --> 00:49:04,867
because that is the only thing
that matters now.

677
00:49:04,868 --> 00:49:06,867
I'm gonna get her back with
or without your fucking help,

678
00:49:06,868 --> 00:49:08,868
and when I do, I...

679
00:49:10,868 --> 00:49:12,687
I am not...

680
00:49:13,868 --> 00:49:16,867
I am not capable
of running this station anymore,

681
00:49:16,868 --> 00:49:18,402
or anything else,
as far as that goes, so

682
00:49:18,427 --> 00:49:23,867
when I get
her back, and I will, I resign.

683
00:50:54,868 --> 00:50:57,867
Hey. Hey. Stop. Stop.

684
00:50:57,868 --> 00:50:59,867
Fucking find her.

685
00:50:59,868 --> 00:51:01,867
We got to fucking find her.

686
00:51:01,868 --> 00:51:02,867
We have to find her.

687
00:51:02,868 --> 00:51:04,867
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

688
00:51:04,868 --> 00:51:07,284
We have to find her.

689
00:51:10,249 --> 00:51:11,868
I'll get her back.

690
00:51:12,305 --> 00:52:12,237
