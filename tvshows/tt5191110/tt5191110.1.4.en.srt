1
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:09,012
Previously on "Berlin Station"...

2
00:00:09,013 --> 00:00:11,219
A second wave of
Thomas Shaw leaks broke,

3
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:13,219
exposing questionable ethics

4
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:15,219
at the highest levels of the agency.

5
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:18,219
The newest casualty being
Deputy Director Jemma Moore.

6
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:20,590
- What is this?
- That is why we are here.

7
00:00:20,615 --> 00:00:22,775
We'll need access to every file, folder,

8
00:00:22,809 --> 00:00:23,808
and Post-it note in this facility.

9
00:00:23,809 --> 00:00:25,808
Where there's a paper trail,
there's Thomas Shaw

10
00:00:25,809 --> 00:00:27,808
to light it on fire and burn us alive.

11
00:00:27,809 --> 00:00:29,808
I took the files out last week,
and I fixed them.

12
00:00:29,809 --> 00:00:32,808
- Nobody's gonna find anything.
- Fake agents, Steven?

13
00:00:32,809 --> 00:00:33,808
They existed only on paper.

14
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:35,808
We took the payments for ourselves.

15
00:00:35,809 --> 00:00:37,808
Thank you for protecting me.

16
00:00:37,809 --> 00:00:39,808
I might have a shot at Deputy Director.

17
00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:41,465
What? Do you want it?

18
00:00:41,466 --> 00:00:42,808
I don't know.

19
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:44,808
Have you had any contact
with Aleksandre Iosava?

20
00:00:44,809 --> 00:00:46,808
What kind of friends
do you think I keep?

21
00:00:46,809 --> 00:00:47,808
You will go to his home

22
00:00:47,809 --> 00:00:50,809
and bring me back
a full, detailed report.

23
00:00:51,287 --> 00:00:53,848

24
00:00:54,003 --> 00:00:57,648

26
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:00,991
_

27
00:01:01,809 --> 00:01:03,808
He said yes? He's saying yes?

28
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:06,185
There were no overtures
to get you to help them?

29
00:01:06,199 --> 00:01:06,967
 No.

30
00:01:06,992 --> 00:01:09,808
Your mission doesn't end
because I'm finished, Daniel.

31
00:01:09,809 --> 00:01:11,808
Thought I'd make one last
contribution while I can.

32
00:01:11,809 --> 00:01:12,808
Julian De Vos.

33
00:01:12,809 --> 00:01:14,808
Kill list? He isn't dead.

34
00:01:14,809 --> 00:01:16,808
No according to you he isn't.

35
00:01:16,809 --> 00:01:18,808
I got to take a leak.

36
00:01:18,809 --> 00:01:19,808
You need to be careful, Daniel.

37
00:01:19,809 --> 00:01:24,809
You know, with this Thomas Shaw
shit going down.

38
00:01:25,809 --> 00:01:27,808
I know you came here
on Jemma Moore's bidding.

39
00:01:27,809 --> 00:01:30,808
She's gone, and you can't do this alone.

40
00:01:30,809 --> 00:01:32,808
I want to help you find Thomas Shaw

41
00:01:32,809 --> 00:01:34,809
'cause he'll take us down if
we don't take him down first.

45
00:03:26,809 --> 00:03:28,808
Oh.

46
00:03:28,809 --> 00:03:30,809
Oh, I dozed off.

47
00:03:31,809 --> 00:03:33,503
I just got here.

48
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:36,809
Just give me a minute.

49
00:03:49,809 --> 00:03:51,808
Sit down.

50
00:03:51,809 --> 00:03:53,808
Whoa.

51
00:03:53,809 --> 00:03:56,808
You know, when I my daughter was a baby,

52
00:03:56,809 --> 00:04:00,808
I used to try to steal away
to this or that safe house

53
00:04:00,809 --> 00:04:03,809
just to catch a nap.

54
00:04:06,809 --> 00:04:07,808
Okay.

55
00:04:07,809 --> 00:04:10,809
That's how we're playing it.

56
00:04:14,633 --> 00:04:17,632
Shaw's courier.

57
00:04:17,809 --> 00:04:19,808
Julian De Vos.

58
00:04:19,809 --> 00:04:21,809
Unredacted.

59
00:04:29,809 --> 00:04:31,808
How did you get it?

60
00:04:31,809 --> 00:04:33,809
Well, I've been doing this
a lot longer than Jemma Moore.

61
00:04:38,965 --> 00:04:40,964
What do you know about
the trigger puller

62
00:04:40,965 --> 00:04:41,964
who was contracted to kill him?

63
00:04:41,965 --> 00:04:44,964
Uh, Frank Dupont,
former Special Activities.

64
00:04:44,965 --> 00:04:49,145
Last anybody knew, he was on
a boat in the Netherlands.

65
00:04:49,965 --> 00:04:51,964
Frank Dupont.

66
00:04:51,965 --> 00:04:53,964
Let's hope the boat's still there.

67
00:04:53,965 --> 00:04:55,964
I'll track him down when I can.

68
00:04:55,965 --> 00:04:57,965
Yeah.

69
00:05:00,965 --> 00:05:01,964
Sorry.

70
00:05:01,965 --> 00:05:03,965
You had a chip on it.

71
00:05:07,965 --> 00:05:09,964
What is your deal, Daniel?

72
00:05:10,426 --> 00:05:12,964
Something about you just doesn't add up.

73
00:05:12,965 --> 00:05:14,964
I'm just doing my job.

74
00:05:14,965 --> 00:05:17,548
Finding Thomas Shaw is not your job.

75
00:05:17,549 --> 00:05:19,964
It's your cause. Why?

76
00:05:19,965 --> 00:05:21,964
You were wounded in Chechnya.

77
00:05:21,965 --> 00:05:24,964
You were branded a war hero...
well, by Langley.

78
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:28,964
And then for 10 years, you're...

79
00:05:28,965 --> 00:05:30,964
you have a cushy analyst job...
10 years.

80
00:05:30,965 --> 00:05:31,964
And then one day, what,
you wake up, you say,

81
00:05:31,965 --> 00:05:34,964
"Gee, you know, I-I think I'd
like to go back in the field."

82
00:05:34,965 --> 00:05:37,234
Thanks for the file.

83
00:05:38,965 --> 00:05:40,965
Daniel.

84
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:45,156
Whatever it is
you're trying to prove, just...

85
00:05:46,965 --> 00:05:50,965
don't let it cloud your judgment
finding Shaw.

86
00:06:08,469 --> 00:06:10,469

87
00:06:11,628 --> 00:06:12,735

88
00:06:12,769 --> 00:06:15,981

89
00:06:16,946 --> 00:06:19,376

90
00:06:20,311 --> 00:06:22,912

91
00:06:23,754 --> 00:06:25,115

92
00:06:25,779 --> 00:06:30,280
_

93
00:06:31,415 --> 00:06:32,606
_

94
00:06:32,657 --> 00:06:34,069
_

95
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:14,965
You don't decide where we meet.

96
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:17,964
Today I do.

97
00:07:17,965 --> 00:07:19,965
I'm not eating my lunch in that dump.

98
00:07:23,459 --> 00:07:26,964
What if I said I had intel
on the truth-teller Shaw?

99
00:07:26,965 --> 00:07:27,964
Truth-teller?

100
00:07:27,965 --> 00:07:29,964
You buy that shit?

101
00:07:29,965 --> 00:07:33,964
Well, my company has just been
hired to safeguard the servers

102
00:07:33,965 --> 00:07:35,964
for the newspaper
that publishes that shit.

103
00:07:35,965 --> 00:07:38,474
- What does that mean?
- No hacker or government

104
00:07:38,475 --> 00:07:40,964
will be able to spy
on the Berliner Zeitung.

105
00:07:40,965 --> 00:07:42,964
Does the Zeitung think
they're being watched?

106
00:07:42,965 --> 00:07:43,964
Of course they do.

107
00:07:43,965 --> 00:07:45,964
Shaw has put
the world spotlight on them.

108
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,964
And now they can afford
to do something about it.

109
00:07:47,965 --> 00:07:49,358
When's it happening?

110
00:07:49,359 --> 00:07:51,964
We're moving all their content
to our facility this week.

111
00:07:51,965 --> 00:07:53,965
Happy?

112
00:07:56,965 --> 00:07:59,964
Now, I want out of this arrangement.

113
00:07:59,965 --> 00:08:01,964
I need everything on the project head,

114
00:08:01,965 --> 00:08:03,964
possibly access to their servers.

115
00:08:05,188 --> 00:08:06,964
Did you hear what I just said?

116
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,964
You have expensive tastes, Lana.

117
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,465
That's probably why we caught you

118
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:14,964
pilfering all that cash
from your company.

119
00:08:17,422 --> 00:08:18,964
This the last time, Kevin.

120
00:08:19,388 --> 00:08:20,896
We'll see.

121
00:08:21,965 --> 00:08:23,965
Enjoy your lunch.

122
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:30,964
- Can I go in?
- Just one second.

123
00:08:30,965 --> 00:08:32,965
Thanks.

124
00:08:36,965 --> 00:08:39,964
I take it you're a no-show
at this week's conference.

125
00:08:39,965 --> 00:08:41,704
Remind me.

126
00:08:41,705 --> 00:08:43,964
Germany-U.S.-Iran economic cooperation.

127
00:08:43,965 --> 00:08:46,433
Second round of investments into Tehran.

128
00:08:46,434 --> 00:08:47,964
Well, yeah, that...

129
00:08:47,965 --> 00:08:49,964
that would be my second favorite
thing to do.

130
00:08:50,246 --> 00:08:51,787
What's your first?

131
00:08:51,788 --> 00:08:52,964
Everything else.

132
00:08:54,037 --> 00:08:55,964
London's Station Chief will be there.

133
00:08:55,965 --> 00:08:58,218
Jason Wolfe? Definitely not going.

134
00:08:58,219 --> 00:08:59,964
Well, you know, the White House
will be there, too,

135
00:08:59,965 --> 00:09:01,964
vetting candidates for Deputy Director.

136
00:09:01,965 --> 00:09:03,964
You know Wolfe's gonna be
gunning for it.

137
00:09:03,965 --> 00:09:05,225
You've been talking to Robert.

138
00:09:05,226 --> 00:09:06,964
You know, it was bad enough

139
00:09:06,965 --> 00:09:08,964
having to work with
that bigot in Vienna.

140
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,964
What, are you trying to get rid of me?

141
00:09:10,965 --> 00:09:11,964
No.

142
00:09:11,965 --> 00:09:13,516
I'm trying to save us all

143
00:09:13,517 --> 00:09:14,964
from having to work
with Jason Wolfe again.

144
00:09:14,965 --> 00:09:17,965
Well, I don't think I'm ready
to leave Berlin.

145
00:09:19,498 --> 00:09:21,498
You seem ready to me.

146
00:09:23,965 --> 00:09:25,240
Daniel.

147
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:26,356
Thank you.

148
00:09:32,335 --> 00:09:34,964
I need you to green-light an op.

149
00:09:34,965 --> 00:09:36,964
What if I told you that I had a way

150
00:09:36,965 --> 00:09:38,964
to get eyes and ears
inside the Berliner Zeitung?

151
00:09:39,599 --> 00:09:42,964
All the documents
Shaw has and will leak...

152
00:09:42,965 --> 00:09:44,545
we'll be a step ahead.

153
00:09:44,546 --> 00:09:46,308
You want to put a tap on the Zeitung?

154
00:09:46,309 --> 00:09:47,964
We have a window of opportunity.

155
00:09:47,965 --> 00:09:50,387
The newspaper's moving their
servers to Joker's company

156
00:09:50,388 --> 00:09:52,471
this week. She can get us access.

157
00:09:52,496 --> 00:09:54,545
I just need station resources
to set up the malware.

158
00:09:54,546 --> 00:09:56,306
I'll get a lot of questions back home.

159
00:09:56,307 --> 00:09:58,409
You know, "Why are you hacking
into a German tech company?"

160
00:09:58,434 --> 00:10:01,433
Call it a mole hunt for a Russian agent

161
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,433
working inside A.S.P.

162
00:10:09,239 --> 00:10:12,238
But where'd the lead come from
for the fake mole?

163
00:10:12,239 --> 00:10:13,238
Say it came from Hans Richter.

164
00:10:13,239 --> 00:10:15,238
Whatever it takes,
so long as only you and I know

165
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:18,239
that this leads us
to the Zeitung or Shaw.

166
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:21,578
Okay.

167
00:10:22,239 --> 00:10:25,238
Um, I'll charge it to my C.I. account,

168
00:10:25,239 --> 00:10:27,238
and I'll make sure no one else
in this station has access

169
00:10:27,239 --> 00:10:28,955
but you and me.

170
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:29,980
Okay?

171
00:11:02,239 --> 00:11:03,238
Hello. Hello.

172
00:11:38,078 --> 00:11:40,077
You saw the exchange of money?

173
00:11:40,102 --> 00:11:43,486
Swingset forked over
an envelope of cash to Iosava.

174
00:11:43,513 --> 00:11:45,513
Your move.

175
00:11:49,239 --> 00:11:51,238
Can't confront him yet.

176
00:11:51,239 --> 00:11:54,238
Donating money to a refugee
foundation is hardly damning.

177
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:58,238
But asking for 20 grand cash is.

178
00:11:58,239 --> 00:12:00,238
You know what people like Iosava
do with that kind of money?

179
00:12:00,239 --> 00:12:04,829
They build bombs and pay
the families of suicide bombers.

180
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:06,238
What's the benefit of waiting?

181
00:12:06,239 --> 00:12:07,809
Buys us time.

182
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,888
I am not walking into
an interrogation room

183
00:12:09,889 --> 00:12:12,238
without knowing the answers
I'm looking for.

184
00:12:12,239 --> 00:12:14,829
Here's a thought... let's get drunk.

185
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:17,238
My best ideas always come after
a second bourbon.

186
00:12:18,239 --> 00:12:20,238
Sweetheart, the only thing
that comes after

187
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:22,176
your second bourbon is your third.

188
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:29,576
I just want something
to reboot post-Faisal.

189
00:12:29,945 --> 00:12:35,238
Something outside this
fucking fluorescent hell.

190
00:12:35,651 --> 00:12:38,019
I get it. I'll see what I can do.

191
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:41,729
Where's Daniel? Is he, uh...

192
00:12:42,924 --> 00:12:46,238
Any signs of anxiety
getting back in the field?

193
00:12:46,845 --> 00:12:49,238
Anxiety? What are you talking about?

194
00:12:49,239 --> 00:12:50,238
What are you... what are you?
His shrink?

195
00:12:50,239 --> 00:12:51,238
Ah.

196
00:12:51,239 --> 00:12:52,238
- Hey.
- Here he is.

197
00:12:52,239 --> 00:12:54,110
- Speak of the devil.
- Oh, yeah?

198
00:12:54,111 --> 00:12:55,238
Did you want to see me?

199
00:12:55,239 --> 00:12:56,238
I'll leave you guys to it.

200
00:12:56,239 --> 00:12:58,238
No, no, no, stick around, Hector.

201
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:02,799
Frost is asking for a tap
on Joker's company, A.S.P.

202
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:05,238
That's, uh, network security, right?

203
00:13:05,239 --> 00:13:07,238
Yeah, I just filed a report on it.

204
00:13:07,239 --> 00:13:09,238
Yeah, he got a tip from the BFV

205
00:13:09,239 --> 00:13:11,238
on a Russian mole inside the company,

206
00:13:11,239 --> 00:13:13,238
but it's the first I've heard about it.

207
00:13:13,239 --> 00:13:15,238
Well, you know the Germans
like to withhold intel

208
00:13:15,239 --> 00:13:17,238
until it serves their own interests.

209
00:13:17,239 --> 00:13:19,731
Along with fresh vegetables
and decent fucking Wi-Fi,

210
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:21,139
but that's beside the point.

211
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,897
So, you want me to tell them
to fuck off?

212
00:13:22,898 --> 00:13:24,702
No, I want you to do it.

213
00:13:24,703 --> 00:13:27,238
But I'm gonna bring Hector in to assist.

214
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:29,238
Okay.

215
00:13:29,239 --> 00:13:31,238
Does it make sense for
the assistant cultural attaché

216
00:13:31,239 --> 00:13:33,238
to be involved in a cyber op?

217
00:13:33,239 --> 00:13:36,238
Hey, who do you think helped
the NSA bug Merkel's phone, hm?

218
00:13:36,239 --> 00:13:38,238
Great, so you two have worked together.

219
00:13:38,239 --> 00:13:40,238
This should be a walk in the park.

220
00:13:40,239 --> 00:13:41,238
Thank you, thank you.

221
00:13:41,239 --> 00:13:43,003
Thank you.

222
00:13:43,838 --> 00:13:45,838
Thank you.

223
00:13:49,239 --> 00:13:50,238
You all right?

224
00:13:50,239 --> 00:13:52,238
I don't need a babysitter, Hector.

225
00:13:52,239 --> 00:13:54,238
I never said you did.

226
00:13:54,239 --> 00:13:55,238
So, why did Robert bring you in?

227
00:13:55,239 --> 00:13:57,238
I just wanted a break from dealing with

228
00:13:57,239 --> 00:13:59,238
all that third-world shit.

229
00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:01,238
And you know, this is
the first thing that came up.

230
00:14:01,239 --> 00:14:04,238
Hey, Chechnya was a war zone.

231
00:14:04,239 --> 00:14:06,238
This is just hacker crap.

232
00:14:06,239 --> 00:14:08,239
You're gonna be fine.

233
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:32,238
Who is this? Jim Beam or Johnnie Walker?

234
00:14:32,239 --> 00:14:35,346
Lana, meet Donald.

235
00:14:36,063 --> 00:14:38,062
That's my name.

236
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,062
Let's make this fast.

237
00:14:41,063 --> 00:14:43,062
You get what I asked for?

238
00:14:43,063 --> 00:14:45,062
Juergen Hoffman...
our Chief Technical Officer.

239
00:14:45,063 --> 00:14:47,062
He runs the entire network.

240
00:14:47,063 --> 00:14:51,062
So, this is our guy.

241
00:14:51,063 --> 00:14:53,063
What are you thinking?

242
00:14:54,805 --> 00:14:56,805
I'm thinking magic date.

243
00:14:59,063 --> 00:15:01,063
What the hell is a magic date?

244
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:07,529
It's another day at the office,

245
00:15:08,063 --> 00:15:10,062
another deadline looming.

246
00:15:10,063 --> 00:15:13,062
Tension high, morale low.

247
00:15:13,063 --> 00:15:17,062
Everyone working around the clock.

248
00:15:17,063 --> 00:15:19,062
It's the perfect time
for an after-work drink

249
00:15:19,063 --> 00:15:20,880
to rally the troops.

250
00:15:20,914 --> 00:15:22,963
_

251
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:25,029
_

252
00:15:25,155 --> 00:15:26,395
_

253
00:15:30,063 --> 00:15:32,062
Find a place where titles don't matter,

254
00:15:32,063 --> 00:15:36,062
where happy hour starts early
and ends late.

255
00:15:36,063 --> 00:15:38,062
Buy a few rounds.

256
00:15:38,063 --> 00:15:45,063
Then get close enough
to make this... a magic date.

257
00:15:54,063 --> 00:15:58,062
Circles, roofies, Mexican Valium,

258
00:15:58,063 --> 00:16:02,062
call it what you want.
The result is the same...

259
00:16:02,063 --> 00:16:05,063
total blackout.

260
00:16:07,754 --> 00:16:09,754
And that's where we come in.

261
00:16:12,687 --> 00:16:13,687
We need to strip him.

262
00:16:19,688 --> 00:16:21,688
Come on, give me a hand.

263
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:26,062
Have you done this before?

264
00:16:26,063 --> 00:16:28,062
Not with a German.

265
00:16:28,063 --> 00:16:30,063
Feeling a little insecure, Kevin?

266
00:16:32,063 --> 00:16:34,062
Be gentle. He's my boss.

267
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:46,879
Cover him up.

268
00:16:54,063 --> 00:16:55,062
What are you doing?

269
00:16:55,063 --> 00:16:59,062
Making sure the application's
up and running.

270
00:16:59,063 --> 00:17:01,063
Hurry up and shut it down.

271
00:17:04,063 --> 00:17:06,063
Just shut it down.

272
00:17:10,063 --> 00:17:12,062
All good to go.

273
00:17:12,063 --> 00:17:13,652
Kevin.

274
00:17:15,654 --> 00:17:17,653
Get ready.

275
00:17:17,863 --> 00:17:19,862
Relax.

276
00:18:13,063 --> 00:18:14,629
- Hey.
- Hey.

277
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:16,062
Still here?

278
00:18:16,063 --> 00:18:18,062
Yeah.

279
00:18:18,063 --> 00:18:20,062
Watching some home movies.

280
00:18:20,063 --> 00:18:22,062
They're proving to be quite ordinary.

281
00:18:23,063 --> 00:18:25,062
The Iosavas.

282
00:18:25,063 --> 00:18:27,813
I used to help Steven
scrub surveillance footage

283
00:18:27,814 --> 00:18:29,062
back at Vienna.

284
00:18:29,063 --> 00:18:32,036
I found the truth always lies
in the ordinary.

285
00:18:33,597 --> 00:18:36,062
You watch a person day in and day out,

286
00:18:36,764 --> 00:18:41,186
even if they don't mean to,
they are giving you something.

287
00:18:42,063 --> 00:18:44,062
Tchus.

288
00:18:44,063 --> 00:18:45,062
Tchus.

289
00:19:14,063 --> 00:19:17,063
What are you up to, Ruth?

290
00:19:29,641 --> 00:19:30,740
_

291
00:19:30,966 --> 00:19:32,300
_

292
00:19:37,253 --> 00:19:39,253
_

293
00:19:40,741 --> 00:19:42,223
_

294
00:20:04,063 --> 00:20:06,063
Everything okay?

295
00:20:07,744 --> 00:20:09,062
You did good today.

296
00:20:09,063 --> 00:20:11,062
Then why do I feel sick to my stomach?

297
00:20:11,063 --> 00:20:13,062
You won't admit,
but you may actually like this.

298
00:20:13,063 --> 00:20:14,062
I like being blackmailed?

299
00:20:14,063 --> 00:20:16,062
You like the adrenaline.

300
00:20:16,063 --> 00:20:19,063
I think it's the same reason
you embezzled.

301
00:20:19,861 --> 00:20:21,062
After this is over,

302
00:20:21,063 --> 00:20:24,009
I'd like you to leave me the fuck alone.

303
00:20:41,063 --> 00:20:43,062
She'll come around.

304
00:20:43,998 --> 00:20:47,062
How about a pre-op drink
before the shit show tomorrow?

305
00:20:47,063 --> 00:20:49,062
I can't. I have dinner plans.

306
00:20:49,063 --> 00:20:51,062
Great, I'm starving.

307
00:21:01,063 --> 00:21:03,062
Hey, Kelly, sorry for the surprise.

308
00:21:03,063 --> 00:21:05,062
I should have called. Yeah.

309
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:07,062
Come in. It's awful out there.

310
00:21:07,063 --> 00:21:10,063
It's fucking freezing is what it is.

311
00:21:11,063 --> 00:21:13,506
Um, I'll make myself scarce.

312
00:21:13,507 --> 00:21:15,062
- Great.
- All right.

313
00:21:15,063 --> 00:21:17,063
Nice to see you, Kelly.

314
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:21,293
Can I sit?

315
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:23,611
What's so urgent?

316
00:21:23,636 --> 00:21:26,953
Uh... the conference with Tehran.

317
00:21:27,063 --> 00:21:29,062
Sandra says you're a no-show.

318
00:21:29,063 --> 00:21:31,062
I thought that's why
you sent her to see me.

319
00:21:31,063 --> 00:21:33,062
It was. Got me. Busted.

320
00:21:33,063 --> 00:21:35,853
But would you really be okay

321
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:38,878
if Jason Wolfe got
the Deputy Director job?

322
00:21:42,063 --> 00:21:44,062
I have something...

323
00:21:44,063 --> 00:21:47,063
big, potentially big for you.

324
00:21:49,063 --> 00:21:52,062
Iran's Minister of Agriculture,
Behruz Zohani,

325
00:21:52,063 --> 00:21:54,062
will be in attendance at the conference.

326
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:57,062
He's in some political hot water
back home.

327
00:21:57,063 --> 00:21:59,063
He could be looking to jump.

328
00:22:00,063 --> 00:22:02,062
- Where's this coming from?
- Mossad.

329
00:22:02,063 --> 00:22:05,062
Oh, yeah, well, only they would
try something like this

330
00:22:05,063 --> 00:22:06,062
on the eve of a major conference.

331
00:22:06,063 --> 00:22:08,062
No, no, no, they've made
a couple of runs already.

332
00:22:08,063 --> 00:22:10,062
This guy's a moderate
and can't be bought.

333
00:22:10,063 --> 00:22:12,062
If we offer a helping hand right now,

334
00:22:12,063 --> 00:22:14,062
Mossad is convinced we can recruit him.

335
00:22:14,063 --> 00:22:17,062
So, uh, the Israelis
can't close the deal,

336
00:22:17,063 --> 00:22:19,062
and they want us to do their dirty work.

337
00:22:19,063 --> 00:22:21,659
You're missing the point, Steven.

338
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:24,062
If you deliver an Iranian Minister,

339
00:22:24,645 --> 00:22:29,063
Jemma Moore's seat
is yours for the taking.

340
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:32,062
What's in it for you? My seat?

341
00:22:32,063 --> 00:22:33,062
I don't want your fucking seat.

342
00:22:33,063 --> 00:22:35,062
No, I'm riding your coattails
out of here.

343
00:22:35,063 --> 00:22:36,579
I... I want out of Berlin
more than you do.

344
00:22:36,604 --> 00:22:39,062
I really appreciate you coming
by, Robert, I do,

345
00:22:39,063 --> 00:22:40,368
but I'm not looking to rock the boat.

346
00:22:40,369 --> 00:22:42,620
If there were ever a time to
rock the fucking boat, Steven,

347
00:22:42,621 --> 00:22:44,062
it's right now.

348
00:22:44,063 --> 00:22:45,893
What? I don't get it.

349
00:22:45,894 --> 00:22:48,062
You complain about bureaucracy
more than I do.

350
00:22:48,699 --> 00:22:53,063
This is your chance right now
to make a difference.

351
00:22:55,453 --> 00:22:59,063
If they really wanted me, they'd call.

352
00:23:03,387 --> 00:23:06,062
I know. I don't get it.

353
00:23:06,063 --> 00:23:07,062
I'd... I'd say sleep on it,

354
00:23:07,063 --> 00:23:09,063
but you might sleep right through it.

355
00:23:13,855 --> 00:23:15,567
Think about it.

356
00:23:15,592 --> 00:23:16,879
Seriously.

357
00:23:26,688 --> 00:23:28,687
He's right.

358
00:23:28,688 --> 00:23:29,687
About what?

359
00:23:29,688 --> 00:23:30,687
All of it.

360
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:33,687
You were listening.

361
00:23:33,688 --> 00:23:35,688
Were you?

362
00:23:41,688 --> 00:23:44,332
Look me in the eye

363
00:23:44,333 --> 00:23:48,687
and tell me you don't want
to be Deputy Director.

364
00:23:49,213 --> 00:23:52,546
You don't want to be
closer to our daughter.

365
00:23:52,547 --> 00:23:55,212
You don't want a fresh start with us.

366
00:23:55,213 --> 00:23:57,212
It's not about wanting.
It's about getting.

367
00:23:57,213 --> 00:24:00,571
It's, uh... the politicking
is... is brutal.

368
00:24:00,596 --> 00:24:05,213
And um, the competition.

369
00:24:10,879 --> 00:24:12,223
Good.

370
00:24:13,029 --> 00:24:15,029
I'll pick out your suit.

371
00:24:23,213 --> 00:24:25,881
One, two...

372
00:24:27,213 --> 00:24:29,212
three.

373
00:24:29,213 --> 00:24:30,212
Oh, what happened?

374
00:24:30,213 --> 00:24:32,212
Oh, so the shaker
went through the table,

375
00:24:32,213 --> 00:24:33,212
and the coin's still there.

376
00:24:33,213 --> 00:24:35,212
How did that happen?

377
00:24:35,213 --> 00:24:37,212
Huh, what's going on?

378
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:41,213
One shaker.

379
00:24:43,213 --> 00:24:46,212
Years of practice and chasing women.

380
00:24:47,213 --> 00:24:49,212
It's so nice to finally meet

381
00:24:49,213 --> 00:24:52,213
one of Danny's friends from the embassy.

382
00:24:54,071 --> 00:24:57,096
_

383
00:25:00,213 --> 00:25:02,212
Yeah, you know, it's... it's funny.

384
00:25:02,213 --> 00:25:04,212
He, um... he never mentioned

385
00:25:04,213 --> 00:25:06,212
he had family in Berlin till tonight.

386
00:25:06,835 --> 00:25:09,212
He must be embarrassed by one of us.

387
00:25:09,213 --> 00:25:10,704
I'm pretty certain that would be me.

388
00:25:10,729 --> 00:25:12,212
Well, you're so shocked I haven't

389
00:25:12,213 --> 00:25:13,212
mentioned Patricia to you before?

390
00:25:13,213 --> 00:25:15,212
What? You think I'm trying to hit on

391
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:17,631
your fun and attractive cousin here?

392
00:25:20,213 --> 00:25:22,213
Excuse me.

393
00:25:24,412 --> 00:25:26,684
Hector, seriously?

394
00:25:44,213 --> 00:25:46,212
Steven Frost, U.S. State Department.

395
00:25:46,213 --> 00:25:49,213
Kelly Frost, plus one.

396
00:25:54,213 --> 00:25:57,212
May I take your coats?

397
00:25:57,213 --> 00:25:58,862
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

398
00:25:58,863 --> 00:26:00,212
Thank you.

399
00:26:07,213 --> 00:26:09,212
Hello.

400
00:26:09,213 --> 00:26:11,212
Kelly. Steven.

401
00:26:11,213 --> 00:26:13,212
I had no idea you two were coming.

402
00:26:13,213 --> 00:26:15,212
Well, last-minute decision.

403
00:26:15,213 --> 00:26:18,212
How can I say no when my Steven asks?

404
00:26:18,213 --> 00:26:19,522
Here you go.

405
00:26:19,523 --> 00:26:22,212
Oh, thank you, dear.

406
00:26:22,213 --> 00:26:26,212
Um, Jeremy, this is my boss,
Steven, and his wife, Kelly.

407
00:26:26,213 --> 00:26:28,212
Jeremy Banks, GSO.

408
00:26:28,213 --> 00:26:31,212
Oh, gee, I thought I knew
everybody in admin.

409
00:26:33,213 --> 00:26:35,749
Uh, excuse me.
A moment, please, will you?

410
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:37,212
Thank you.

411
00:26:42,785 --> 00:26:44,901
I'm really glad
you had a change of heart.

412
00:26:44,902 --> 00:26:47,212
You're very convincing.
So, where are we at?

413
00:26:47,213 --> 00:26:49,212
Uh, well, the good news is
Behruz is already checked in.

414
00:26:49,213 --> 00:26:51,212
The bad news is
Jason Wolfe is indeed here.

415
00:26:51,213 --> 00:26:52,786
You've seen him?

416
00:26:52,787 --> 00:26:54,212
Yeah, he's out there
kissing White House ass.

417
00:26:54,213 --> 00:26:56,212
Oh, gee, that doesn't sound like him.

418
00:26:56,213 --> 00:26:58,212
No. Uh, but listen...

419
00:26:58,213 --> 00:27:00,212
the important thing, obviously,

420
00:27:00,213 --> 00:27:03,212
is that he not catch wind of
what we're up to with...

421
00:27:03,213 --> 00:27:04,866
Of course not.
He'd immediately cut in line.

422
00:27:04,867 --> 00:27:05,950
Good.

423
00:27:05,975 --> 00:27:08,213
I-I'll go and establish contact.

424
00:27:13,213 --> 00:27:15,212
I need a card, please.

425
00:27:26,213 --> 00:27:30,213
Compliments from the management
for Mr. Behruz Zohani.

426
00:27:37,459 --> 00:27:39,459
_

427
00:29:20,213 --> 00:29:23,212
It took everything
I had not to burst out laughing.

428
00:29:23,213 --> 00:29:25,212
Jason Wolfe.

429
00:29:25,213 --> 00:29:27,212
- Ah, Frosty the old man.
- How are you?

430
00:29:27,213 --> 00:29:29,212
How is it possible that your wife

431
00:29:29,213 --> 00:29:31,212
hasn't aged a day since Vienna?

432
00:29:31,213 --> 00:29:33,212
Yet you, Frosty, Jesus.

433
00:29:33,213 --> 00:29:36,212
How's Julia?

434
00:29:36,213 --> 00:29:38,212
Well, she tore out my heart
and ran it over with a pickup...

435
00:29:38,213 --> 00:29:40,212
that I bought her.

436
00:29:40,213 --> 00:29:41,212
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

437
00:29:41,213 --> 00:29:42,825
- Yeah, me too.
- Hors d'oeuvre?

438
00:29:42,826 --> 00:29:44,212
Oh.

439
00:29:44,213 --> 00:29:46,212
Berlin really is
the cushiest assignment.

440
00:29:46,213 --> 00:29:47,212
Mm.

441
00:29:47,213 --> 00:29:49,212
You know, if it wasn't for Thomas Shaw,

442
00:29:49,213 --> 00:29:51,212
Headquarters would never know
how little you guys work.

443
00:29:51,213 --> 00:29:53,212
Right.

444
00:29:53,213 --> 00:29:55,212
What brings you to town?

445
00:29:55,213 --> 00:29:57,781
There's a Deputy Director seat
that needs filling

446
00:29:57,806 --> 00:29:59,714
and an NSC staffer close to
the President to butter up...

447
00:29:59,739 --> 00:30:00,896
same as your husband.

448
00:30:00,897 --> 00:30:03,863
No, no, no, that's a young man's
game, not mine.

449
00:30:03,864 --> 00:30:05,212
Then why bring this lovely creature here

450
00:30:05,213 --> 00:30:07,329
to run a charm offensive?

451
00:30:08,213 --> 00:30:10,212
Enh, enh, enh.

452
00:30:10,213 --> 00:30:11,212
Towelhead alert.

453
00:30:11,213 --> 00:30:13,212
Behruz Zohani.

454
00:30:13,213 --> 00:30:16,213
Iranian Agriculture Minister.

455
00:30:17,075 --> 00:30:18,074
You know him?

456
00:30:18,075 --> 00:30:19,074
Don't need to.

457
00:30:19,075 --> 00:30:21,074
All I need to know
is that his best friend

458
00:30:21,075 --> 00:30:22,719
is a suitcase full of cash.

459
00:30:22,749 --> 00:30:24,749
Oh.

460
00:30:30,075 --> 00:30:33,074
I'm moving into position now.

461
00:30:33,075 --> 00:30:34,994
Copy.

462
00:30:36,075 --> 00:30:39,074
Ready and waiting to receive.

463
00:30:50,075 --> 00:30:52,215
Eyes on you from my position.

464
00:31:10,075 --> 00:31:11,074
You hear me?

465
00:31:11,075 --> 00:31:13,074
All good.

466
00:31:13,075 --> 00:31:15,074
Okay, it's your show.

467
00:31:15,075 --> 00:31:16,664
Take it.

468
00:31:16,665 --> 00:31:18,074
Okay, this is Alpha checking in.

469
00:31:18,075 --> 00:31:20,074
I want eyes on the north
and south exits.

470
00:31:20,075 --> 00:31:22,074
Copy, Alpha.

471
00:31:22,075 --> 00:31:24,074
See you on the other side.

472
00:31:30,075 --> 00:31:31,560
So, come on.

473
00:31:31,585 --> 00:31:34,695
Frost really sent us up here
on a Russian mole hunt?

474
00:31:34,696 --> 00:31:37,074
I don't know. You'd have to ask Frost.

475
00:31:37,075 --> 00:31:39,074
It's fine if you don't want to tell me.

476
00:31:39,075 --> 00:31:41,074
You know, after last night,
I wouldn't be surprised.

477
00:31:41,075 --> 00:31:43,074
What do you mean?

478
00:31:43,075 --> 00:31:45,074
Well, you keeping me in the dark

479
00:31:45,075 --> 00:31:46,712
about having a family in Berlin,
you know?

480
00:31:46,713 --> 00:31:48,074
What's that all about?

481
00:31:48,075 --> 00:31:50,074
What? You think
I should've set you two up?

482
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:52,074
What do you want me to say, Hector?

483
00:31:52,075 --> 00:31:54,074
Just say the truth, Daniel.

484
00:31:54,075 --> 00:31:56,074
You don't trust me with them, do you?

485
00:31:57,390 --> 00:31:58,893
E.T.A. on the connection?

486
00:31:58,894 --> 00:32:01,074
Yeah, I'm working on it.

487
00:32:02,464 --> 00:32:06,075
I have a visual on the target.

488
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:15,131
_

489
00:32:16,138 --> 00:32:17,404
_

490
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,998
_

491
00:32:19,032 --> 00:32:21,565
_

492
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:23,673
_

493
00:32:23,707 --> 00:32:29,107
_

494
00:32:30,143 --> 00:32:33,074
That reporter, Ingrid Hollander,
is here.

495
00:32:33,578 --> 00:32:35,074
You're fucking kidding me.

496
00:32:35,075 --> 00:32:36,399
Nope.

497
00:32:37,075 --> 00:32:39,254
Why? What's it to you?

498
00:32:54,075 --> 00:32:56,075
You don't need to do that.

499
00:32:58,075 --> 00:32:59,074
What?

500
00:32:59,075 --> 00:33:02,074
- Put on an act.
- Oh.

501
00:33:02,075 --> 00:33:04,074
Don't tell me going out
to an economic conference

502
00:33:04,075 --> 00:33:06,074
is your idea of a good time.

503
00:33:08,568 --> 00:33:11,074
You were always too good for Steven.

504
00:33:11,075 --> 00:33:12,074
I'd beg to differ.

505
00:33:12,075 --> 00:33:14,074
You need someone
who can keep up with you,

506
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:17,075
not the dying captain of the old guard.

507
00:33:18,075 --> 00:33:20,074
Come on.

508
00:33:20,075 --> 00:33:22,075
Tell me you never thought about it.

509
00:33:26,075 --> 00:33:28,074
Admittedly,

510
00:33:28,075 --> 00:33:30,074
I have not.

511
00:33:30,075 --> 00:33:32,074
Bullshit. You asked about Jules,

512
00:33:32,075 --> 00:33:33,074
made sure she was out of the picture

513
00:33:33,075 --> 00:33:35,074
before you made your move.

514
00:33:35,075 --> 00:33:38,074
Mm, you certainly have my number, Jason.

515
00:33:38,075 --> 00:33:41,074
You know Steven can't
keep his dick in his pants.

516
00:33:41,075 --> 00:33:43,074
He was banging Sandra in Vienna.

517
00:33:43,075 --> 00:33:45,074
I'd say the way he looks at her,

518
00:33:45,075 --> 00:33:47,075
he's still getting dim sum of that.

519
00:33:48,807 --> 00:33:50,806
You really think that's news to me?

520
00:33:51,464 --> 00:33:54,075
Then what's the problem here?

521
00:33:57,075 --> 00:34:00,548
I don't think you're worth
the regime of penicillin.

522
00:34:19,075 --> 00:34:20,074
What? What is it?

523
00:34:20,075 --> 00:34:22,393
Jason Wolfe.

524
00:34:23,891 --> 00:34:25,891
Forget it.

525
00:34:30,075 --> 00:34:32,074
Steven.

526
00:34:57,550 --> 00:35:00,074
Shouldn't you be out there
buttering up the White House?

527
00:35:00,075 --> 00:35:01,411
Thought I'd give you a fighting chance.

528
00:35:01,436 --> 00:35:04,243
Yeah. Make it a bourbon
straight up, please.

529
00:35:06,075 --> 00:35:08,074
Come on, Frosty.

530
00:35:08,075 --> 00:35:10,074
What the fuck else are you doing
at this thing?

531
00:35:10,075 --> 00:35:11,690
Oh.

532
00:35:11,715 --> 00:35:13,714
- Admittedly?
- Uh-huh.

533
00:35:14,075 --> 00:35:16,074
Behruz Zohani.

534
00:35:16,075 --> 00:35:18,830
The, uh, Minister of
Agriculture, the towelhead.

535
00:35:18,831 --> 00:35:20,074
Yeah, yeah.

536
00:35:20,075 --> 00:35:23,074
Yeah, I was here because
I was supposed to

537
00:35:23,075 --> 00:35:25,074
oversee a recruitment mission
until the whole...

538
00:35:25,075 --> 00:35:27,074
thing went south.

539
00:35:27,075 --> 00:35:29,074
What are you doing with the Iranians?

540
00:35:29,075 --> 00:35:31,074
- You don't even speak Farsi.
- I don't...

541
00:35:31,075 --> 00:35:33,074
They tell me the guy's a moderate,

542
00:35:33,075 --> 00:35:36,074
he can't be bribed,
and then out of the blue,

543
00:35:36,075 --> 00:35:38,074
he wants a suitcase
full of fucking cash.

544
00:35:38,075 --> 00:35:40,074
I told you. They're all corrupt.

545
00:35:42,075 --> 00:35:44,735
And he want... He wants to meet me.

546
00:35:44,736 --> 00:35:47,074
I got no authorization to pay him.

547
00:35:47,075 --> 00:35:51,075
Well, London Station has carte
blanche on Iranian targets.

548
00:35:52,075 --> 00:35:54,075
- You do?
- Uh-huh.

549
00:35:56,075 --> 00:35:57,992
We could use my money.

550
00:35:59,075 --> 00:36:01,074
Why would you want to do that?

551
00:36:01,905 --> 00:36:04,074
You write up a report
that said I saved the day.

552
00:36:04,075 --> 00:36:07,074
I'm a reasonable fellow, Frosty.

553
00:36:10,075 --> 00:36:12,074
Man, I don't know what to say.

554
00:36:12,075 --> 00:36:13,693
Say, "Thank you for the recruit."

555
00:36:13,694 --> 00:36:16,075
And I'll remember it
when I move up to Deputy.

556
00:36:17,724 --> 00:36:18,723
Yes, sir.

557
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:24,074
I'm not receiving anything.

558
00:36:34,075 --> 00:36:36,074
It should be broadcasting.

559
00:36:36,075 --> 00:36:39,074
Yeah, well, clearly it's not.

560
00:36:39,075 --> 00:36:42,075
There must be a malfunction
in Juergen's laptop.

561
00:36:46,075 --> 00:36:47,074
So, what do we do?

562
00:36:47,075 --> 00:36:51,074
Someone is gonna have to
manually upload the malware.

563
00:36:51,075 --> 00:36:53,074
You mean enter the building?

564
00:36:53,075 --> 00:36:55,074
No, no, no, no, no. We abort.

565
00:36:55,075 --> 00:36:58,074
If we're gonna abort, now's the time.

566
00:36:58,075 --> 00:37:00,074
I don't care what Headquarters says.

567
00:37:00,075 --> 00:37:01,635
It's not worth it.

568
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:05,074
That's... That's my call to make.

569
00:37:05,075 --> 00:37:06,401
Look, it's my fuck-up.

570
00:37:06,402 --> 00:37:08,074
I rigged the laptop.

571
00:37:08,075 --> 00:37:11,410
- We need a decision.
- Yeah. Just give me a second.

572
00:37:18,806 --> 00:37:20,074
Can you get word to Joker?

573
00:37:20,075 --> 00:37:21,389
Copy.

574
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:24,510
There's a roughpad with
the malware on it in the duffel.

575
00:37:24,511 --> 00:37:28,075
Connect it to the server,
then get the hell out.

576
00:37:29,075 --> 00:37:31,074
You really want to do this?

577
00:37:31,075 --> 00:37:33,074
I'm going in. End of discussion.

578
00:37:33,075 --> 00:37:35,075
Don't be a fucking martyr.

579
00:37:37,594 --> 00:37:39,074
And if you get caught?

580
00:37:39,803 --> 00:37:42,075
See you on the other side.

581
00:37:43,075 --> 00:37:46,074
Headquarters confirmed
it's a female bomber.

582
00:37:46,075 --> 00:37:50,075
Al-Qaeda, an equal-opportunity employer.

583
00:37:54,075 --> 00:37:57,074
10 to 5:00, still no sign.

584
00:37:57,075 --> 00:37:58,917
Nothing yet.

585
00:38:03,431 --> 00:38:06,074
Okay, let's get you to the perimeter.

586
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:09,075
Wait a second.

587
00:38:15,075 --> 00:38:17,023
I need eyes at 11:00.

588
00:38:21,075 --> 00:38:23,074
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

589
00:38:23,075 --> 00:38:25,475
You sure that's her?

590
00:38:29,075 --> 00:38:31,075
I need a visual.

591
00:38:32,075 --> 00:38:34,075
Go to the perimeter.

592
00:38:40,075 --> 00:38:42,074
Subject is opening her bag.

593
00:38:42,075 --> 00:38:43,074
Subject is opening her bag.

594
00:38:43,075 --> 00:38:45,918
Locked on target. Say the word, Alpha.

595
00:38:47,075 --> 00:38:49,074
Take the shot.

596
00:38:49,075 --> 00:38:50,074
Take the fucking shot.

597
00:38:57,075 --> 00:38:59,074
Get out of there now!

598
00:39:09,075 --> 00:39:11,074
Fuck.

599
00:39:33,075 --> 00:39:36,074
You fucking people.
You know what I'm risking here?

600
00:39:36,075 --> 00:39:40,074
I need you to take me to the
Berliner Zeitung servers now.

601
00:39:40,075 --> 00:39:43,075
Put this on.

602
00:40:17,075 --> 00:40:19,074
It's the second-last on the left.

603
00:40:19,774 --> 00:40:21,074
Go back to your desk.

604
00:40:21,075 --> 00:40:23,074
You've done more than enough.

605
00:40:50,566 --> 00:40:53,990
_

606
00:40:56,132 --> 00:40:58,069
_

607
00:40:58,170 --> 00:41:00,836
_

608
00:41:00,943 --> 00:41:03,394
_

609
00:41:06,516 --> 00:41:09,803
_

610
00:41:11,843 --> 00:41:13,843
_

611
00:41:14,075 --> 00:41:16,075
Hallo?

612
00:42:05,799 --> 00:42:07,799
Whatever you did worked.

613
00:42:10,615 --> 00:42:12,074
We're in.

614
00:42:17,075 --> 00:42:19,540
Then let's get the hell out of Dodge.

615
00:42:19,565 --> 00:42:21,564
What about Daniel?

616
00:42:21,691 --> 00:42:23,691
He'll be right behind us.

617
00:42:30,075 --> 00:42:32,715
_

618
00:42:42,075 --> 00:42:43,074
I got you.

619
00:43:00,075 --> 00:43:03,074
Listen to me, listen to me,
listen to me.

620
00:43:03,075 --> 00:43:06,074
There was no woman
except the one who blew herself up.

621
00:43:06,075 --> 00:43:08,074
Al-Qaeda led us into the square.

622
00:43:08,075 --> 00:43:10,074
They set the whole thing up.
That's my story.

623
00:43:10,075 --> 00:43:12,074
That's what goes in my report, okay?

624
00:43:12,075 --> 00:43:13,074
Okay.

625
00:43:13,075 --> 00:43:15,074
Okay.

626
00:43:16,041 --> 00:43:18,041
Brat'ya. _

627
00:43:20,075 --> 00:43:22,075
You take care.

628
00:43:39,075 --> 00:43:40,751
Okay, I'm out.

629
00:43:42,683 --> 00:43:44,682
Hector?

630
00:43:45,075 --> 00:43:46,895
Hector?

631
00:43:48,075 --> 00:43:50,075
Hector.

632
00:43:53,075 --> 00:43:55,136
Black or with cream?

633
00:43:56,075 --> 00:43:57,074
Black, please.

634
00:43:57,075 --> 00:43:59,074
He'll be here any moment.

635
00:44:01,075 --> 00:44:03,074
Here you go.

636
00:44:03,075 --> 00:44:05,074
Ah, here he is.

637
00:44:05,075 --> 00:44:07,074
Um, uh, Mr. Zohani, the man
I've been telling you about...

638
00:44:07,075 --> 00:44:09,074
- Steven Frost.
- Nice to meet you.

639
00:44:09,075 --> 00:44:11,074
Jason Wolfe. Pleasure.

640
00:44:11,075 --> 00:44:14,074
So, we're here to
discuss our shared interests

641
00:44:14,075 --> 00:44:17,074
in a safe and a discreet manner.

642
00:44:17,075 --> 00:44:19,074
Yes?

643
00:44:19,075 --> 00:44:21,074
Have a seat.

644
00:44:23,687 --> 00:44:26,074
I've already spoken with your colleague.

645
00:44:26,727 --> 00:44:29,074
He knows about my troubles.

646
00:44:29,075 --> 00:44:30,786
That's right, and...

647
00:44:30,836 --> 00:44:32,836
_

648
00:44:32,861 --> 00:44:34,861
_

649
00:44:35,075 --> 00:44:39,074
I am authorized to offer you
10,000 Euro right now

650
00:44:39,075 --> 00:44:41,074
and another 10,000 after you begin

651
00:44:41,075 --> 00:44:43,074
delivering information that
we're interested in.

652
00:44:43,075 --> 00:44:45,074
This isn't about money.

653
00:44:46,292 --> 00:44:48,074
No, there's no need to pretend.

654
00:44:48,075 --> 00:44:51,075
We're... we're all friends here.
What's your price?

655
00:44:51,774 --> 00:44:53,642
_

656
00:44:53,799 --> 00:44:56,074
I was told this was about
working with you,

657
00:44:56,075 --> 00:44:58,074
- not for you.
- Yes.

658
00:44:58,075 --> 00:44:59,074
Look, I'm not like Houjin Lin.

659
00:44:59,075 --> 00:45:01,074
Please, I apologize. I ap...

660
00:45:01,075 --> 00:45:03,074
I have made a terrible mistake
in choosing my partner.

661
00:45:03,075 --> 00:45:05,074
Please, don't insult me further.

662
00:45:05,075 --> 00:45:06,074
I know you bought off Mr. Lin

663
00:45:06,075 --> 00:45:08,074
from selling nuclear secrets to Iran.

664
00:45:08,075 --> 00:45:11,074
Everyone has heard the rumors
that he's under your protection.

665
00:45:11,075 --> 00:45:13,074
I thought I could
look past this, but he...

666
00:45:13,075 --> 00:45:15,074
flaunting his money around,

667
00:45:15,075 --> 00:45:18,075
shows me that we will never
be able work together.

668
00:45:23,075 --> 00:45:24,074
You devious piece of shit.

669
00:45:24,075 --> 00:45:27,074
to discredit me. You only did this

670
00:45:27,075 --> 00:45:29,436
If I were you, I would
get out from under his thumb

671
00:45:29,437 --> 00:45:31,075
while you can.

672
00:45:39,075 --> 00:45:41,074
What the fuck was that?

673
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:43,074
We had a plan.

674
00:45:43,075 --> 00:45:46,075
Well, I think it succeeded.

675
00:45:48,075 --> 00:45:50,074
- What about the Israelis?
- Well, I can...

676
00:45:50,075 --> 00:45:53,580
I can help them a lot more
when I'm Deputy Director.

677
00:46:08,075 --> 00:46:10,445
Manhattan, please.

678
00:46:11,075 --> 00:46:13,165
Is he the one?

679
00:46:14,499 --> 00:46:16,498
Jeremy?

680
00:46:16,523 --> 00:46:18,074
Ask me in a month.

681
00:46:20,075 --> 00:46:23,764
It took me and Steven
all of five minutes.

682
00:46:23,765 --> 00:46:26,074
That was 30 years ago.

683
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:31,074
If it isn't over already
between you two, it is now.

684
00:47:02,075 --> 00:47:04,074
Hey, it's Valerie Edwards.

685
00:47:04,075 --> 00:47:07,075
Can you tap into
the Solara Travel Agency?

686
00:47:14,075 --> 00:47:16,447
Jesus, man. I thought you'd been...

687
00:47:16,448 --> 00:47:17,823
What?

688
00:47:17,848 --> 00:47:19,130
Made?

689
00:47:20,075 --> 00:47:22,074
Where's Johnson?

690
00:47:22,075 --> 00:47:24,074
He's gone. I-I sent him home.

691
00:47:24,075 --> 00:47:26,074
And the malware in A.S.P.?

692
00:47:26,075 --> 00:47:28,365
Up and running. We did it, man.

693
00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:30,389
Did we?

694
00:47:31,075 --> 00:47:32,945
We didn't do anything.

695
00:47:35,075 --> 00:47:36,074
I can't always save you, Daniel.

696
00:47:36,075 --> 00:47:38,075
- Excuse me?
- Forget it.

697
00:47:41,075 --> 00:47:44,075
Please tell me this isn't
about Chechnya.

698
00:47:47,266 --> 00:47:49,159
Christ, Hector.

699
00:47:50,075 --> 00:47:52,074
Just because you saved my ass
10 years ago,

700
00:47:52,075 --> 00:47:54,647
does not mean it's okay for me to fall
on the fucking sword for you.

701
00:47:54,648 --> 00:47:56,074
That's funny.
You know, in all the years,

702
00:47:56,075 --> 00:47:58,074
I don't think you ever once thanked me.

703
00:47:58,075 --> 00:47:59,756
I didn't get a chance.

704
00:47:59,757 --> 00:48:01,681
You made me buy the lie

705
00:48:01,682 --> 00:48:03,074
on top of selling it to everybody else.

706
00:48:03,075 --> 00:48:05,074
Would you rather
I told the truth in my report,

707
00:48:05,075 --> 00:48:08,074
sent you home a fuck-up,
rather than a hero?

708
00:48:08,075 --> 00:48:10,074
- You self-righteous asshole.
- Says the cattle.

709
00:48:10,075 --> 00:48:12,074
You nearly got blown up in Chechnya,

710
00:48:12,075 --> 00:48:13,074
and you almost got blown up today.

711
00:48:13,075 --> 00:48:16,075
It's only a matter of time
before you get blown up again.

712
00:48:22,075 --> 00:48:24,074
European leaders met today in Brussels

713
00:48:24,075 --> 00:48:26,074
to discuss the plans going forward

714
00:48:26,075 --> 00:48:29,075
without British participation...

715
00:48:38,075 --> 00:48:41,074
Golda, what are you doing here?

716
00:48:41,075 --> 00:48:43,074
Sorry for visiting so late.

717
00:48:43,075 --> 00:48:45,074
No, no, don't be silly. Come in.

718
00:48:45,075 --> 00:48:48,074
I heard about the conference.

719
00:48:48,075 --> 00:48:50,074
Oh, yeah.

720
00:48:50,075 --> 00:48:52,074
It didn't go very well.

721
00:48:52,075 --> 00:48:54,074
I'm sorry about Behruz.

722
00:48:54,075 --> 00:48:55,074
Fucking Steven Frost.

723
00:48:55,075 --> 00:48:57,075
It's okay, Robert.

724
00:48:59,075 --> 00:49:01,075
I brought you some soup.

725
00:49:06,686 --> 00:49:08,074
You made me soup.

726
00:49:08,075 --> 00:49:09,606
You look thin.

727
00:49:10,974 --> 00:49:14,974
But now let's talk about
what else you can do for us.

728
00:49:24,566 --> 00:49:26,566
It was amazing.

729
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,640
You were amazing.

730
00:49:36,075 --> 00:49:39,074
The way you played that Jason Wolfe

731
00:49:39,075 --> 00:49:43,075
like the stupid fiddle that he is.

732
00:49:44,672 --> 00:49:46,074
Tell me what he did.

733
00:49:46,075 --> 00:49:48,074
Mnh-mnh.

734
00:49:48,075 --> 00:49:50,535
You tell me.

735
00:49:53,075 --> 00:49:57,075
Was that for me today
or for the Deputy Directorship?

736
00:49:59,075 --> 00:50:02,075
Would it be the wrong answer
to say they're one in the same?

737
00:50:05,331 --> 00:50:08,074
That's exactly the right answer.

738
00:50:10,075 --> 00:50:13,074
I hope this is the expensive shit.

739
00:50:13,075 --> 00:50:16,074
Oh, I only save that
for the important company.

740
00:50:16,075 --> 00:50:19,074
I followed Ruth Iosava today.

741
00:50:19,075 --> 00:50:20,239
And?

742
00:50:21,506 --> 00:50:27,074
She visited not just one
but two travel agencies.

743
00:50:27,075 --> 00:50:30,074
I can only imagine how desperate she is

744
00:50:30,075 --> 00:50:31,405
to get away from her husband.

745
00:50:31,406 --> 00:50:33,618
Well, think again.

746
00:50:34,075 --> 00:50:36,074
Been so busy watching him,

747
00:50:36,075 --> 00:50:38,074
haven't paid any attention to her.

748
00:50:38,075 --> 00:50:40,074
What's she doing?

749
00:50:40,075 --> 00:50:42,074
Flying in suicide bombers, package deal?

750
00:50:43,456 --> 00:50:46,074
Well, initially,
that was my first thought.

751
00:50:46,075 --> 00:50:48,551
So, I had somebody check it out.

752
00:50:49,075 --> 00:50:52,074
There were three
suspicious tickets purchased.

753
00:50:52,075 --> 00:50:56,074
Berlin to Istanbul, one-way, in cash.

754
00:50:56,075 --> 00:50:59,074
So, she's sending men out,
not bringing them in.

755
00:50:59,075 --> 00:51:01,074
Not me.

756
00:51:01,075 --> 00:51:02,074
Girls.

757
00:51:02,075 --> 00:51:03,074
Holy shit.

758
00:51:03,075 --> 00:51:05,074
Holy shit is right.

759
00:51:05,075 --> 00:51:06,074
There was one ticket

760
00:51:06,075 --> 00:51:10,074
that was just issued a few days
ago to a Yasmin Bashir.

761
00:51:10,075 --> 00:51:13,074
Germany confirmed that
she's already in Syria.

762
00:51:13,831 --> 00:51:18,074
And Facebook says that she's
about to wed Zarqawi's friend.

763
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:20,074
ISIL brides.

764
00:51:20,075 --> 00:51:22,008
And the other two?

765
00:51:23,677 --> 00:51:25,140
Haven't left yet.

766
00:51:27,075 --> 00:51:29,074
Well done.

767
00:51:31,075 --> 00:51:32,244
Hello?

768
00:51:50,075 --> 00:51:51,723
Kevin?

769
00:51:52,075 --> 00:51:55,074
I'm sorry I couldn't be there in person.

770
00:51:55,075 --> 00:51:58,074
There's an envelope on the table.

771
00:51:58,848 --> 00:52:01,074
Go ahead and open it.

772
00:52:15,075 --> 00:52:17,074
That's everything we have.

773
00:52:17,075 --> 00:52:21,576
Proof of the money you stole,
bank statements, surveillance.

774
00:52:21,577 --> 00:52:23,074
What is this?

775
00:52:23,075 --> 00:52:25,074
Another threat?

776
00:52:25,075 --> 00:52:27,299
I'm done blackmailing you, Lana.

777
00:52:30,075 --> 00:52:32,074
Your debt's paid.

778
00:52:32,523 --> 00:52:35,074
It's up to you if you want
to keep on working with me.

779
00:53:38,042 --> 00:53:40,042
_

780
00:53:43,075 --> 00:53:45,074
Say it.

781
00:53:46,073 --> 00:53:48,034
I'm from Headquarters.

782
00:53:50,075 --> 00:53:51,644
What took you so long?

783
00:54:00,488 --> 00:54:02,074
Drink?

784
00:54:02,075 --> 00:54:03,441
I'm good.

785
00:54:06,075 --> 00:54:10,074
I heard someone
pulled Julian De Vos' file.

786
00:54:10,369 --> 00:54:13,074
Only a matter of time
before you showed up.

787
00:54:13,419 --> 00:54:15,675
De Vos isn't dead.

788
00:54:15,676 --> 00:54:17,808
- Who said he was?
- His file.

789
00:54:17,809 --> 00:54:19,271
I shot him, sure.

790
00:54:20,075 --> 00:54:22,438
But unless you got eyes
on a body yourself,

791
00:54:22,463 --> 00:54:24,074
never count them for dead.

792
00:54:24,290 --> 00:54:27,074
Then who claimed that he was?

793
00:54:27,075 --> 00:54:29,074
Well, that'd be the Germans.

794
00:54:29,272 --> 00:54:32,074
Headquarters believes
what it wants to believe.

795
00:54:32,075 --> 00:54:33,858
That's its fatal flaw.

796
00:54:33,859 --> 00:54:35,646
So you don't trust the Germans?

797
00:54:35,647 --> 00:54:37,075
I don't trust anyone.

798
00:54:40,075 --> 00:54:42,074
Who is Julian De Vos?

799
00:54:42,075 --> 00:54:44,074
A guilty man who thinks he's innocent.

800
00:54:44,075 --> 00:54:45,074
Guilty of what?

801
00:54:45,075 --> 00:54:46,387
You got the file.

802
00:54:46,388 --> 00:54:48,074
You just said the file was unreliable.

803
00:54:48,075 --> 00:54:49,602
I want to hear it from you.

804
00:54:53,075 --> 00:54:55,074
He rented three different
cash-only flats

805
00:54:55,075 --> 00:54:57,218
to terrorist cells in Brussels.

806
00:54:58,075 --> 00:54:59,505
He's either a willing conspirator

807
00:54:59,530 --> 00:55:01,074
or a flat-out dumbshit.

808
00:55:01,075 --> 00:55:03,074
Belgians took him down,

809
00:55:03,631 --> 00:55:07,074
but not before some unemployed
sex-starved fuckhead

810
00:55:07,075 --> 00:55:10,883
sent himself, two cops,
and one of ours to paradise.

811
00:55:10,884 --> 00:55:14,455
That was eight... nine years ago.

812
00:55:16,075 --> 00:55:21,074
He was young. I was less old.

813
00:55:21,075 --> 00:55:25,695
So, De Vos was sent to a black site,

814
00:55:26,766 --> 00:55:28,765
escaped,

815
00:55:28,790 --> 00:55:30,046
and you were contracted to kill him.

816
00:55:30,075 --> 00:55:32,075
What the fuck happened?

817
00:55:37,476 --> 00:55:39,074
People don't escape those things.

818
00:55:41,075 --> 00:55:43,074
Someone let him out.

819
00:55:43,917 --> 00:55:46,074
You sure you don't want that drink?

820
00:55:59,898 --> 00:56:08,456
