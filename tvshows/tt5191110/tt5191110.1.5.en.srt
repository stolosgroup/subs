1
00:00:07,127 --> 00:00:09,126
Previously on "Berlin Station"...

2
00:00:09,127 --> 00:00:10,619
What if I told you that I had a way

3
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,126
to get eyes and ears
inside the Berliner Zeitung?

4
00:00:13,127 --> 00:00:16,126
All the documents
Shaw has and will leak...

5
00:00:16,127 --> 00:00:17,126
we'll be a step ahead.

6
00:00:17,127 --> 00:00:20,126
Okay. I'll make sure no one else
in this station has access.

7
00:00:20,127 --> 00:00:22,126
It's so nice to finally meet

8
00:00:22,127 --> 00:00:24,126
one of Danny's friends from the embassy.

9
00:00:24,127 --> 00:00:25,126
Well, you're so shocked I haven't

10
00:00:25,127 --> 00:00:26,126
mentioned Patricia to you before?

11
00:00:26,127 --> 00:00:28,126
What? You think I'm trying to hit on

12
00:00:28,127 --> 00:00:30,126
your fun and attractive cousin here?

13
00:00:30,127 --> 00:00:32,126
Houjin Lin called me last night.

14
00:00:32,127 --> 00:00:34,126
Said he's antsy, wants to take a walk.

15
00:00:34,127 --> 00:00:35,126
Bang.

16
00:00:35,127 --> 00:00:39,126
I am former Major General,
People's Liberation Army.

17
00:00:39,127 --> 00:00:40,126
This is the gratitude I get
for trading secrets?

18
00:00:40,127 --> 00:00:43,126
With Thomas Shaw out there,
you're a big enough risk

19
00:00:43,127 --> 00:00:45,127
just sitting home watching TV.

20
00:00:50,127 --> 00:00:53,126
Swingset forked over
an envelope of cash to Iosava.

21
00:00:53,127 --> 00:00:54,704
What's the benefit of waiting?

22
00:00:54,705 --> 00:00:56,720
I am not walking into
an interrogation room

23
00:00:56,745 --> 00:00:58,126
without knowing the answers
I'm looking for.

24
00:00:58,127 --> 00:01:00,126
Would you really be okay

25
00:01:00,127 --> 00:01:02,402
if Jason Wolfe got
the Deputy Director job?

26
00:01:02,403 --> 00:01:03,749
This isn't about money.

27
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,677
We will never be able to work together.

28
00:01:05,678 --> 00:01:08,126
You devious piece of shit.
You only did this to discredit me.

29
00:01:08,127 --> 00:01:10,126
I would get out from
under his thumb while you can.

30
00:01:10,127 --> 00:01:12,126
What the fuck was that? We had a plan.

31
00:01:12,127 --> 00:01:14,126
Well, I think it succeeded.

32
00:01:14,127 --> 00:01:15,764
I followed Ruth Iosava today.

33
00:01:15,765 --> 00:01:17,126
Been so busy watching him,

34
00:01:17,127 --> 00:01:19,126
haven't paid any attention to her.

35
00:01:19,127 --> 00:01:20,700
So, she's sending men out,
not bringing them in.

36
00:01:20,701 --> 00:01:23,126
Not men. Girls.

37
00:01:23,127 --> 00:01:24,126
ISIL brides.

38
00:01:24,127 --> 00:01:26,126
Julian De Vos. Unredacted.

39
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:29,126
De Vos was sent to a black site,

40
00:01:29,127 --> 00:01:31,126
escaped, and you were contracted
to kill him.

41
00:01:31,127 --> 00:01:32,126
What the fuck happened?

42
00:01:32,127 --> 00:01:34,126
People don't escape those things.

43
00:01:34,127 --> 00:01:35,127
Someone let him out.

44
00:01:41,151 --> 00:01:49,667

46
00:03:25,127 --> 00:03:27,126
Screaming, "Let me out"

47
00:04:09,127 --> 00:04:11,126
You afraid you will jump or fall?

48
00:04:12,343 --> 00:04:14,126
What are you talking about?

49
00:04:14,127 --> 00:04:18,273
Well, you know, when
you're standing on the edge.

50
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,084
Everyone's afraid of one or the other.

51
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:25,445
They're afraid
they'll accidentally fall or...

52
00:04:26,127 --> 00:04:28,127
purposefully jump.

53
00:04:30,753 --> 00:04:31,752
Fall.

54
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:34,280
You see, I'm the opposite.

55
00:04:35,936 --> 00:04:37,844
Afraid I'll jump every time.

56
00:04:44,936 --> 00:04:46,935
Deliver to Ingrid directly.

57
00:04:47,694 --> 00:04:49,170
What's on it?

58
00:04:50,936 --> 00:04:54,446
Chinese defector Houjin Lin.

59
00:04:54,936 --> 00:04:57,526
Spilled nuclear secrets

60
00:04:57,527 --> 00:05:00,382
in exchange for resettlement in Germany.

61
00:05:00,936 --> 00:05:02,935
We've already made enemies
of the Agency.

62
00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:04,935
Now you're antagonizing the Germans.

63
00:05:04,936 --> 00:05:06,682
That's the point.

64
00:05:08,326 --> 00:05:09,665
There will be consequences.

65
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:12,447
And they will be on my terms.

66
00:05:14,327 --> 00:05:17,224
I want them all to be afraid of me.

67
00:05:53,536 --> 00:05:55,091
Hello? Hi.

68
00:05:56,024 --> 00:05:57,471
And you are?

69
00:05:57,472 --> 00:05:59,870
Daniel. I work with Steven.

70
00:06:00,004 --> 00:06:01,003
Well, come in, Daniel.

71
00:06:04,004 --> 00:06:05,525
Can I grab you a coffee?

72
00:06:05,526 --> 00:06:06,492
Uh, no, thanks.

73
00:06:06,493 --> 00:06:08,004
Okay.

74
00:06:14,004 --> 00:06:15,765
What are you doing in my house?

75
00:06:15,766 --> 00:06:18,003
It's the Berliner Zeitung tap.

76
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:20,868
The Zeitung's about to
drop a new Shaw leak.

77
00:06:22,468 --> 00:06:23,896
Houjin Lin.

78
00:06:25,004 --> 00:06:26,355
He knows Lin defected

79
00:06:26,356 --> 00:06:28,003
and spilled Chinese nuclear secrets,

80
00:06:28,004 --> 00:06:30,289
and worse, he has photographs
of the nuclear test site

81
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:31,510
Lin oversaw.

82
00:06:31,511 --> 00:06:34,865
Corpses, deformed bodies... all of it.

83
00:06:38,004 --> 00:06:40,306
You got to be shitting me.

84
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:46,013
My name is all over the cable traffic.

85
00:06:47,004 --> 00:06:49,384
And Robert ran point. He moved him in.

86
00:06:49,385 --> 00:06:51,144
He babysat for the asshole.

87
00:06:53,004 --> 00:06:54,737
If this comes down...

88
00:06:57,004 --> 00:06:58,004
I'm done.

89
00:07:02,477 --> 00:07:03,477
Unless...

90
00:07:06,713 --> 00:07:09,003
...we undermine the story
before the headline drops.

91
00:07:09,897 --> 00:07:13,003
Discredit the leak,
discredit the source.

92
00:07:13,169 --> 00:07:15,003
Now, in an ideal world,

93
00:07:15,004 --> 00:07:18,003
Shaw feels us closing in
around him and he...

94
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:21,530
he slips up and he does
something irrational.

95
00:07:21,531 --> 00:07:23,003
Leads us right to him.

96
00:07:23,004 --> 00:07:26,003
Yeah. Okay.

97
00:07:26,718 --> 00:07:28,003
I'll speak to the Germans,

98
00:07:28,004 --> 00:07:30,003
and I'll keep you posted
on the details of the operation.

99
00:07:30,004 --> 00:07:33,003
I was hoping to follow up
on the Julian De Vos file.

100
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,003
I need access
to that Moroccan black site...

101
00:07:36,004 --> 00:07:38,003
a list of everyone who came
in contact with him.

102
00:07:38,004 --> 00:07:40,917
There is no way he escaped on his own.

103
00:07:42,004 --> 00:07:43,254
No.

104
00:07:43,516 --> 00:07:45,146
Lin takes precedence.

105
00:07:46,842 --> 00:07:48,004
Sure.

106
00:07:52,668 --> 00:07:54,555
Morning, Mary, Tom.

107
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,227
- Morning.
- Ken.

108
00:07:56,228 --> 00:07:58,003
It's Carl.

109
00:07:58,004 --> 00:08:00,004
Carl.

110
00:08:03,004 --> 00:08:05,003
Jane, any messages?

111
00:08:05,004 --> 00:08:06,003
Of course not.

112
00:08:06,004 --> 00:08:07,003
Thanks.

113
00:08:07,004 --> 00:08:09,003
Franz. Hector DeJean.

114
00:08:09,004 --> 00:08:11,003
I've got an extra ticket
for the Deutsche Oper

115
00:08:11,004 --> 00:08:12,003
on Saturday night.

116
00:08:12,004 --> 00:08:15,003
Let's, uh, get some drinks,

117
00:08:15,004 --> 00:08:16,562
make a night of it.

118
00:08:16,587 --> 00:08:17,832
Tschues.

119
00:08:39,733 --> 00:08:43,212
Shaw's going to expose
incriminating evidence

120
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:45,529
about Houjin Lin,

121
00:08:46,004 --> 00:08:47,560
and he's calling it a joint operation

122
00:08:47,561 --> 00:08:50,254
because he knows that you helped us

123
00:08:51,004 --> 00:08:53,004
exfiltrate Lin from China.

124
00:08:56,477 --> 00:08:58,003
This could permanently destroy

125
00:08:58,004 --> 00:09:01,003
our relationship with the Chinese.

126
00:09:01,004 --> 00:09:04,003
That's assuming they can prove it.

127
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:08,477
What are you proposing?

128
00:09:09,389 --> 00:09:11,357
Discreet relocation.

129
00:09:14,004 --> 00:09:15,004
It's risky.

130
00:09:17,004 --> 00:09:19,004
I don't see an alternative, Hans.

131
00:09:43,004 --> 00:09:46,003
Hey. We good?

132
00:09:46,004 --> 00:09:48,003
Sure.

133
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,810
You don't sound very convincing.

134
00:09:51,004 --> 00:09:54,003
If you're asking
if I was able to mend relations

135
00:09:54,004 --> 00:09:57,003
with the Israelis after
you left me high and dry,

136
00:09:57,004 --> 00:10:00,003
the answer is yeah, we're good.

137
00:10:00,586 --> 00:10:02,033
No, you and me.

138
00:10:04,397 --> 00:10:05,564
Sure.

139
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:12,003
Um, Valerie's gonna brief me
on Iosava in five.

140
00:10:12,004 --> 00:10:13,004
I want you to join.

141
00:10:14,883 --> 00:10:15,918
Okay.

142
00:10:26,004 --> 00:10:27,003
Yes!

143
00:10:27,004 --> 00:10:28,003
Shit.

144
00:10:28,571 --> 00:10:31,003
First I'd like to thank the Academy,

145
00:10:31,004 --> 00:10:34,003
and, uh, the other nominees
in my category.

146
00:10:34,004 --> 00:10:38,003
I'd also like to thank
my agent... my secret agent.

147
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:41,003
- Yeah, you're an asshole.
- Hey, come on.

148
00:10:41,004 --> 00:10:42,453
I still love you.

149
00:10:43,004 --> 00:10:46,004
Even if you are a poor fucking loser.

150
00:10:47,796 --> 00:10:49,334
Did you just say what I think you said?

151
00:10:49,335 --> 00:10:51,338
What? That you're a poor fucking loser?

152
00:10:52,004 --> 00:10:53,689
You fucking love me?

153
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:56,003
Okay, I'm glad this isn't
going to your head.

154
00:10:56,004 --> 00:10:58,003
Do you want to pick out rings together?

155
00:10:58,004 --> 00:11:00,674
Better yet, invite
our parents to dinner?

156
00:11:00,675 --> 00:11:02,003
Fuck off.

157
00:11:02,004 --> 00:11:04,230
I would, but I'm really enjoying this.

158
00:11:04,231 --> 00:11:05,655
Honestly...

159
00:11:06,004 --> 00:11:08,003
I hate you.

160
00:11:16,004 --> 00:11:18,370
- Morgen.
- Morgen.

161
00:12:13,004 --> 00:12:14,004
I'll drive.

162
00:12:22,004 --> 00:12:24,085
So, where are you from?

163
00:12:25,463 --> 00:12:27,069
Germany.

164
00:12:28,677 --> 00:12:30,745
You ever lived anywhere else?

165
00:12:32,004 --> 00:12:33,537
Why would I do that?

166
00:12:33,643 --> 00:12:34,961
Oh, I don't know.

167
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,733
Experience sunshine,

168
00:12:36,734 --> 00:12:39,003
eat something other than
glorified hot dogs.

169
00:12:39,623 --> 00:12:41,696
Yeah, that's the appeal.

170
00:12:43,004 --> 00:12:44,055
Ah.

171
00:12:45,004 --> 00:12:47,003
Grew up in East Germany.

172
00:12:47,615 --> 00:12:50,003
Says an entitled man from West Berlin.

173
00:12:50,004 --> 00:12:54,003
Ow. You always this charming?

174
00:12:54,004 --> 00:12:56,003
You always this inquisitive?

175
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:18,003
Ah, they're just kids.

176
00:13:18,004 --> 00:13:21,003
21st-century terrorism.
Fuckers play dirty.

177
00:13:21,004 --> 00:13:22,577
You sure about this?

178
00:13:23,004 --> 00:13:26,003
It tracks both financially
and ideologically.

179
00:13:26,004 --> 00:13:28,003
Am I sure? Of course not.

180
00:13:28,278 --> 00:13:31,003
But Ruth Iosava went to
two separate travel agencies

181
00:13:31,004 --> 00:13:34,003
and paid two tickets, one way, in cash.

182
00:13:34,004 --> 00:13:36,003
So, my gut's telling me
that they are moving radicals

183
00:13:36,004 --> 00:13:38,003
out of Germany and not refugees in.

184
00:13:38,215 --> 00:13:41,003
And if I'm wrong,
I will shoulder the blame.

185
00:13:41,004 --> 00:13:43,003
Okay, who... who am I looking at?

186
00:13:43,004 --> 00:13:45,636
They all attend the same
international girls' school.

187
00:13:45,661 --> 00:13:48,003
We have confirmation that Yasmin,

188
00:13:48,004 --> 00:13:50,003
this girl here on the left,
she already made it to Syria.

189
00:13:50,004 --> 00:13:51,331
The other two?

190
00:13:51,332 --> 00:13:54,003
Uh, Girl in the middle...
Daayna, German citizen.

191
00:13:54,004 --> 00:13:57,003
And Sabina, technically one of ours.

192
00:13:57,004 --> 00:14:01,003
Dual citizenship, but both
these girls have tickets

193
00:14:01,004 --> 00:14:04,003
to Istanbul leaving Schonefeld
tomorrow morning.

194
00:14:04,004 --> 00:14:05,666
So, the parents are moderates?

195
00:14:05,667 --> 00:14:07,003
Yeah, seemingly.

196
00:14:07,004 --> 00:14:09,003
No, nobody's fucking moderate anymore.

197
00:14:09,004 --> 00:14:12,003
I'll check with Mossad and see
if these girls are on their radar.

198
00:14:12,004 --> 00:14:13,003
L-L-Let... Let's hold off on that.

199
00:14:13,004 --> 00:14:14,003
I'd really rather not

200
00:14:14,004 --> 00:14:16,003
get another intelligence agency
involved.

201
00:14:16,004 --> 00:14:18,003
Oh, I'm sorry.
Who appointed you Deputy Chief?

202
00:14:18,004 --> 00:14:21,752
No. J-Just... For now, we'll hold off.

203
00:14:21,753 --> 00:14:24,003
And you let Robert know if
and when he needs to reach out.

204
00:14:24,004 --> 00:14:26,004
- Okay.
- Yeah, be sure to let Robert know.

205
00:14:28,453 --> 00:14:32,003
Uh, Johnson already
has a surveillance team

206
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:34,003
on both these girls as of this morning.

207
00:14:34,004 --> 00:14:37,591
Hopefully an opportunity arises
and Clare can make contact.

208
00:14:37,592 --> 00:14:41,003
Best-case scenario...
we directly link these girls

209
00:14:41,028 --> 00:14:44,737
to Ruth and Aleksandre Iosava
before they depart Schonefeld.

210
00:14:44,762 --> 00:14:45,668
Worst case?

211
00:14:45,669 --> 00:14:48,004
I'm sure we're gonna find out.

212
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:24,381
Well, you're really laying it on thick.

213
00:15:25,677 --> 00:15:27,273
Unintentionally.

214
00:15:28,004 --> 00:15:29,681
It's safe here.

215
00:15:31,489 --> 00:15:32,825
What do you want?

216
00:15:36,161 --> 00:15:39,269
When was the last time
you attended a service?

217
00:15:40,004 --> 00:15:43,667
Oh, boy. Uh, I don't know.

218
00:15:45,004 --> 00:15:47,779
I was 13, I guess.

219
00:15:49,004 --> 00:15:52,411
Technically a man, except for my voice,

220
00:15:53,004 --> 00:15:56,003
which had the unfortunate
tendency to crack

221
00:15:56,004 --> 00:15:59,209
every time Rachel Burkowitz
would enter the room.

222
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:04,004
She was something else.

223
00:16:10,004 --> 00:16:11,003
Listen.

224
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:14,003
If you want my allegiance
because my last name

225
00:16:14,004 --> 00:16:15,084
is Kirsch...

226
00:16:16,378 --> 00:16:18,819
I recommend you look elsewhere.

227
00:16:20,004 --> 00:16:22,003
We want your allegiance
because you are one

228
00:16:22,004 --> 00:16:25,003
of the most valuable
American intelligence officers

229
00:16:25,004 --> 00:16:29,139
in Europe, positioned
for upwards mobility.

230
00:16:30,004 --> 00:16:33,411
Your support would be
a huge gain for Tel Aviv.

231
00:16:34,004 --> 00:16:35,866
A huge gain?

232
00:16:42,367 --> 00:16:43,606
No.

233
00:16:44,496 --> 00:16:47,003
My loyalties are not for sale.

234
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:48,910
Should be.

235
00:16:51,004 --> 00:16:54,003
Neither Steven Frost nor the Agency

236
00:16:54,004 --> 00:16:56,319
grant you the respect you deserve.

237
00:17:02,232 --> 00:17:04,358
They don't see your full potential.

238
00:17:05,004 --> 00:17:06,354
We do.

239
00:17:20,004 --> 00:17:21,003
Nobody home.

240
00:17:26,004 --> 00:17:27,663
It smells like ass in here.

241
00:17:27,664 --> 00:17:29,003
- Who the fuck are you?
- Who the fuck is he?

242
00:17:29,004 --> 00:17:31,003
You're being relocated.

243
00:17:31,004 --> 00:17:32,003
Get dressed.

244
00:17:32,004 --> 00:17:34,003
Germany's no longer a safe haven.

245
00:17:34,004 --> 00:17:36,003
Tegel Airport is too heavily monitored.

246
00:17:36,004 --> 00:17:38,003
We'll transfer you to Poland
and you'll fly out from there.

247
00:17:38,004 --> 00:17:40,003
- And go where?
- United States of America.

248
00:17:40,004 --> 00:17:42,003
Fuck that.

249
00:17:42,004 --> 00:17:43,003
It's the best we can do.

250
00:17:43,004 --> 00:17:45,427
United States not safe, okay?

251
00:17:45,428 --> 00:17:49,003
Too many guns, too many GMOs,
plus Chinese spooks everywhere.

252
00:17:49,004 --> 00:17:51,638
I don't know where that came from.
It's not mine.

253
00:17:51,639 --> 00:17:53,626
German residence is not an option.

254
00:17:54,346 --> 00:17:56,507
With all due respect...

255
00:17:57,004 --> 00:17:59,003
- fuck you.
- I recommend you listen to the lady.

256
00:17:59,004 --> 00:18:03,003
If not, I'll take it upon myself
to make your address public.

257
00:18:03,004 --> 00:18:04,003
I'll give you an hour, two tops

258
00:18:04,004 --> 00:18:05,461
before someone puts a bullet
in your head.

259
00:18:05,462 --> 00:18:07,527
Honestly, it would make
my life so much easier.

260
00:18:07,528 --> 00:18:09,003
You're just a job.

261
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:10,003
Whether you live or die
doesn't matter to me.

262
00:18:10,004 --> 00:18:11,551
Either way, I get paid.

263
00:18:11,552 --> 00:18:14,003
Nice try, cocksucker. I'm not going.

264
00:18:14,004 --> 00:18:16,003
Nazi bitch!

265
00:18:23,387 --> 00:18:27,003
What's going on? Why are they here?

266
00:18:27,722 --> 00:18:29,003
Sit, Bora.

267
00:18:29,387 --> 00:18:30,369
No.

268
00:18:31,004 --> 00:18:32,266
I insist.

269
00:18:35,004 --> 00:18:37,267
I don't have time for this.

270
00:18:38,769 --> 00:18:40,769
Oh, neither do I.

271
00:18:42,322 --> 00:18:46,003
But you gave Iosava 20,000 Euro in cash.

272
00:18:47,514 --> 00:18:49,546
I knew this would happen.

273
00:18:51,889 --> 00:18:53,394
You knew what would happen?

274
00:18:55,387 --> 00:18:58,003
When two white men exchange money,

275
00:18:58,004 --> 00:19:00,003
it's called a business transaction.

276
00:19:00,004 --> 00:19:02,561
When two brown men
do exactly the same thing,

277
00:19:03,004 --> 00:19:05,003
it's called funding terrorism.

278
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:07,430
Are you funding terrorism?

279
00:19:07,849 --> 00:19:09,848
I won't dignify that with an answer.

280
00:19:10,222 --> 00:19:13,414
Aleksandre Iosava is a militant salafi.

281
00:19:14,613 --> 00:19:17,003
A reformed Islamic radical

282
00:19:17,004 --> 00:19:20,003
who is collecting money
to house displaced refugees.

283
00:19:20,542 --> 00:19:23,003
They risk their lives
to make it to a foreign country

284
00:19:23,004 --> 00:19:25,003
where they'll face bigots like you.

285
00:19:26,657 --> 00:19:28,656
If lying to you means helping them,

286
00:19:29,269 --> 00:19:32,121
so be it.

287
00:19:33,514 --> 00:19:37,002
That money that you gave to Iosava

288
00:19:37,797 --> 00:19:40,049
is not funding refugees.

289
00:19:41,004 --> 00:19:44,003
It is being used to smuggle
young girls into Syria,

290
00:19:44,004 --> 00:19:47,003
where they will be raped and beaten

291
00:19:47,004 --> 00:19:50,207
and raped again
for the rest of their lives.

292
00:19:51,004 --> 00:19:53,289
So, you tell me, Bora.

293
00:19:54,837 --> 00:19:56,837
Which fucking side are you on?

294
00:20:08,004 --> 00:20:09,101
Hallo.

295
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,127
I need to piss.

296
00:20:56,483 --> 00:20:57,966
Don't spill.

297
00:20:59,004 --> 00:21:02,003
What I need to do
will not fit in this bottle.

298
00:21:02,004 --> 00:21:03,622
We're not stopping.

299
00:21:30,004 --> 00:21:31,683
Hey.

300
00:21:31,684 --> 00:21:33,200
Purse?

301
00:21:36,779 --> 00:21:38,003
For someone who gave up smoking,

302
00:21:38,004 --> 00:21:41,003
you always seem to have
a lot of cigarettes on hand.

303
00:21:42,004 --> 00:21:44,004
- No judging.
- Never.

304
00:21:50,781 --> 00:21:52,003
You make contact?

305
00:21:52,717 --> 00:21:56,667
Uh, Daayna, German, is more dominant.

306
00:21:56,668 --> 00:21:59,003
Shocker, I know.

307
00:21:59,004 --> 00:22:01,140
I'd say this whole thing is her idea.

308
00:22:02,004 --> 00:22:04,003
Sabina is reserved, shy.

309
00:22:04,609 --> 00:22:06,294
She's just along for the ride.

310
00:22:07,004 --> 00:22:08,003
They open up?

311
00:22:08,004 --> 00:22:10,003
A little, but nothing damning.

312
00:22:10,466 --> 00:22:14,698
They're acting like normal,
lying, sexed-up teenagers.

313
00:22:15,012 --> 00:22:16,278
Buying lingerie.

314
00:22:17,004 --> 00:22:20,003
Well, can't buy it in Syria.

315
00:22:20,004 --> 00:22:22,762
It's the most coveted item
on the black market.

316
00:22:24,004 --> 00:22:25,010
They smart?

317
00:22:26,004 --> 00:22:28,346
They might be smart enough
to pull this off.

318
00:22:35,004 --> 00:22:36,004
Hector loves me.

319
00:22:38,521 --> 00:22:39,692
He said that?

320
00:22:39,693 --> 00:22:42,003
What can I say? I'm irresistible.

321
00:22:42,383 --> 00:22:45,003
I'll assume you said
something snarky in return.

322
00:22:45,004 --> 00:22:47,373
Of course I did.

323
00:22:47,723 --> 00:22:48,731
Mnh.

324
00:22:51,288 --> 00:22:52,439
Hey.

325
00:22:53,423 --> 00:22:55,004
You love him?

326
00:22:56,004 --> 00:22:58,004
Of course I do.

327
00:23:06,942 --> 00:23:09,004
Shit.

328
00:23:15,004 --> 00:23:18,669
Oh. Hey, Molly. I was looking for Noah.

329
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:20,003
We had a Skype scheduled.

330
00:23:20,004 --> 00:23:21,587
Well, Noah's unavailable.

331
00:23:21,588 --> 00:23:23,003
Um, okay. He's 13.

332
00:23:23,004 --> 00:23:25,003
I think he can squeeze me
into his schedule.

333
00:23:25,004 --> 00:23:27,004
Well, he wanted to go
camping with Billy.

334
00:23:31,004 --> 00:23:34,003
So, um, I'm gonna...

335
00:23:34,284 --> 00:23:36,003
I'm gonna need your help here, Molly.

336
00:23:36,004 --> 00:23:38,003
You got to... You got to work with me.

337
00:23:38,004 --> 00:23:41,003
He's my son, and you can't
keep me from talking to him.

338
00:23:41,004 --> 00:23:43,003
You want to talk to him so badly,

339
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:45,003
why don't you hop on a plane
and come see him?

340
00:23:45,004 --> 00:23:47,003
Oh, I see. I'm definitely not
stopping you from doing that.

341
00:23:47,004 --> 00:23:48,343
Oh, right, yeah, well, you're

342
00:23:48,368 --> 00:23:50,453
the one who started this
clusterfuck, Molly.

343
00:23:50,454 --> 00:23:53,003
You left Berlin
and took my son with you.

344
00:23:53,004 --> 00:23:55,003
You could've come with us.

345
00:23:55,004 --> 00:23:57,003
You know as well as I do

346
00:23:57,004 --> 00:23:59,747
that leaving was not an option for me.

347
00:23:59,748 --> 00:24:01,955
I have a job in Berlin.
You know what I do.

348
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,626
I don't have time for this.

349
00:24:05,004 --> 00:24:05,960
Fuck.

350
00:24:11,004 --> 00:24:12,004
Fuck!

351
00:24:21,004 --> 00:24:22,421
One last question...

352
00:24:23,004 --> 00:24:25,494
Where am I going to live
in the United States?

353
00:24:25,495 --> 00:24:27,186
Scottsdale, Arizona.

354
00:24:27,522 --> 00:24:30,003
- What's in Scottsdale?
- The desert.

355
00:24:30,004 --> 00:24:32,003
Ugh. You know, I burn real easy.

356
00:24:32,004 --> 00:24:34,456
Enough. This is not open
for negotiation.

357
00:24:34,714 --> 00:24:39,003
Look, Germany has a population
of, what, 80 million?

358
00:24:39,004 --> 00:24:40,227
The U.S... 300 million.

359
00:24:40,513 --> 00:24:42,003
Where do you think
you'll stand a better chance

360
00:24:42,004 --> 00:24:43,003
of staying hidden?

361
00:24:43,004 --> 00:24:45,804
- Between her legs.
- Will you shut the fuck up?

362
00:25:23,401 --> 00:25:25,003
I need to piss!

363
00:25:25,004 --> 00:25:27,003
I can either do it
on this nice leather seat

364
00:25:27,004 --> 00:25:28,376
or outside... It's your call.

365
00:25:28,377 --> 00:25:29,678
Go ahead and piss your pants.

366
00:25:29,703 --> 00:25:32,003
There's no way in hell
you're getting out of this car.

367
00:25:32,533 --> 00:25:34,353
You want to fuck the Nazi, don't you?

368
00:25:34,854 --> 00:25:37,003
She's never gonna fuck you.

369
00:25:37,004 --> 00:25:38,003
Is that right?

370
00:25:38,004 --> 00:25:40,003
She can smell your pussy a mile away.

371
00:25:43,004 --> 00:25:45,003
Oh, fuck. Shit, shit.

372
00:25:45,004 --> 00:25:47,003
I need to get out of here.

373
00:25:47,004 --> 00:25:48,003
Pull yourself together.

374
00:25:48,004 --> 00:25:50,003
If you get out, you're gonna get hurt.

375
00:25:50,004 --> 00:25:52,003
You don't give a fuck about me,
remember?

376
00:25:52,004 --> 00:25:53,003
Here's the thing.

377
00:25:53,004 --> 00:25:56,003
When I decide to finish something, I do.

378
00:25:56,004 --> 00:25:58,003
Promises aren't worth shit.

379
00:25:58,004 --> 00:25:59,003
I bet you have some colleagues
in Beijing

380
00:25:59,004 --> 00:26:01,052
who'll say the same thing about you.

381
00:26:35,004 --> 00:26:37,805
Hi. Can I get a table for one, please?

382
00:26:37,806 --> 00:26:40,003
- Thank you.
- Hector.

383
00:26:40,004 --> 00:26:41,244
- Hey.
- Hey.

384
00:26:41,245 --> 00:26:43,003
How are you?

385
00:26:43,004 --> 00:26:44,414
What a surprise.

386
00:26:46,004 --> 00:26:47,582
Hello. Hector DeJean.

387
00:26:47,583 --> 00:26:49,003
Sarah. Nice to meet you.

388
00:26:49,004 --> 00:26:50,116
Nice to meet you, too.

389
00:26:51,004 --> 00:26:52,003
Look, I don't want to interrupt.

390
00:26:52,004 --> 00:26:54,003
- No, no, no.
- I was just leaving.

391
00:26:54,004 --> 00:26:56,003
It's okay. See you.

392
00:26:56,004 --> 00:26:57,648
- Cheers.
- Okay, bye.

393
00:26:57,649 --> 00:26:58,928
Bye.

394
00:27:01,004 --> 00:27:02,003
Do you want some company?

395
00:27:02,004 --> 00:27:04,003
No, I-I'm just gonna grab a bite and...

396
00:27:04,004 --> 00:27:06,496
I have my babysitter till midnight.

397
00:27:07,004 --> 00:27:09,004
Well, if you insist.

398
00:27:14,004 --> 00:27:16,003
So, how is the little guy?

399
00:27:16,004 --> 00:27:18,587
He's great, like always.

400
00:27:18,588 --> 00:27:20,294
How are you?

401
00:27:20,295 --> 00:27:21,475
I'm great. Thank you.

402
00:27:21,476 --> 00:27:24,003
Just let them get on the plane.

403
00:27:24,004 --> 00:27:26,003
We'll have a team
waiting for them in Ataturk.

404
00:27:26,004 --> 00:27:28,361
You know there will be somebody
waiting for them

405
00:27:28,362 --> 00:27:30,254
- in arrivals to transport...
- It's too risky. We could lose them.

406
00:27:30,255 --> 00:27:31,647
No, we won't lose them,

407
00:27:31,648 --> 00:27:33,003
and we need to get a better handle

408
00:27:33,004 --> 00:27:35,003
on how this entire operation works.

409
00:27:35,004 --> 00:27:37,003
We... We need to know
what routes they're taking,

410
00:27:37,004 --> 00:27:39,531
how and where they're
getting them across the border.

411
00:27:39,532 --> 00:27:42,003
But at what cost? At what cost?
Sacrificing children.

412
00:27:42,004 --> 00:27:44,003
We'll do everything in our
fucking power to protect them,

413
00:27:44,004 --> 00:27:48,003
but we cannot ignore the blatant
opportunity that we have here.

414
00:27:48,004 --> 00:27:50,003
We need to understand the intricacies

415
00:27:50,004 --> 00:27:52,003
of how these young women
are being moved.

416
00:27:52,004 --> 00:27:53,003
Otherwise the body count

417
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:55,003
will become a hell of a lot
more than just these three.

418
00:27:55,004 --> 00:27:57,371
I say we stop them before
they get on the plane.

419
00:27:57,372 --> 00:28:00,637
Now, when Laura was that age,
she was highly impressionable.

420
00:28:00,662 --> 00:28:03,003
And if you threaten them
with calling their parents

421
00:28:03,004 --> 00:28:05,003
or harangue them with jail time,
they'll talk!

422
00:28:05,004 --> 00:28:06,003
These girls aren't Laura, Steven!

423
00:28:06,004 --> 00:28:08,003
They probably won't talk,

424
00:28:08,004 --> 00:28:09,579
and then we'll have lost
our only opportunity

425
00:28:09,604 --> 00:28:11,003
for gathering meaningful intelligence.

426
00:28:11,004 --> 00:28:14,003
Robert, the confession by
the girls ties them to Iosava,

427
00:28:14,004 --> 00:28:16,003
then we allow the Germans
to come in and make the arrest.

428
00:28:16,004 --> 00:28:18,120
That's if the Germans cooperate.

429
00:28:23,691 --> 00:28:25,584
Valerie? It's your op.

430
00:28:25,585 --> 00:28:28,003
Don't drag me in here and ask my opinion

431
00:28:28,004 --> 00:28:29,604
only to completely disregard it.

432
00:28:29,605 --> 00:28:32,004
- Watch it. Watch it.
- This is becoming a fucking thing.

433
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:42,870
It's your call.

434
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:49,003
Stopping the girls at Schonefeld
is the most risk-averse option,

435
00:28:49,004 --> 00:28:51,003
because once they're out of the country,

436
00:28:51,004 --> 00:28:53,003
possible missteps
increase exponentially.

437
00:28:53,004 --> 00:28:56,003
Oh, I get it now...
You found a new friend

438
00:28:56,004 --> 00:28:57,003
to push around and "yes" you
to fucking death.

439
00:28:57,004 --> 00:28:59,003
Oh, Jesus Christ. This is not personal.

440
00:28:59,004 --> 00:29:00,003
Of course this is fucking personal.

441
00:29:00,004 --> 00:29:02,003
All right, Valerie, would you
excuse us for just a minute?

442
00:29:02,004 --> 00:29:02,995
- Oh, gladly.
- Thank you.

443
00:29:02,996 --> 00:29:05,003
No, Valerie, stay. I really
think you should hear this.

444
00:29:05,004 --> 00:29:07,003
I-I-I did two years in Baghdad

445
00:29:07,004 --> 00:29:09,659
and another four in Amman
working the takfiris.

446
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:12,552
My knowledge of
Islamic fundamentalism alone

447
00:29:12,553 --> 00:29:13,704
is what landed me the job

448
00:29:13,705 --> 00:29:15,503
of Deputy Fucking Chief here in Berlin.

449
00:29:15,504 --> 00:29:18,003
I-I worked Abu Muhammed al Maqdisi

450
00:29:18,004 --> 00:29:19,003
long before anyone knew who he was.

451
00:29:19,004 --> 00:29:21,616
I ran Zarqawi into the fucking ground!

452
00:29:21,617 --> 00:29:22,853
So, should I go on?!

453
00:29:22,854 --> 00:29:25,003
Yeah, I know a thing
or two about salafis.

454
00:29:25,004 --> 00:29:28,003
I'd wager to say there's no one here
in this room who knows more.

455
00:29:28,004 --> 00:29:31,266
Why don't we just calm down?

456
00:29:31,267 --> 00:29:34,003
My title in the hierarchy
of this station is above yours

457
00:29:34,004 --> 00:29:37,003
for a reason, so don't
fucking tell me to calm down.

458
00:29:37,457 --> 00:29:40,568
Your behavior is inappropriate
and unacceptable.

459
00:29:40,569 --> 00:29:42,003
It's reckless and self-serving,

460
00:29:42,004 --> 00:29:45,003
and I swear to God, if this shit
continues, Steven, I'll...

461
00:29:45,004 --> 00:29:46,003
What?

462
00:29:46,004 --> 00:29:49,004
You will... will fucking...
You will what?

463
00:29:58,004 --> 00:29:58,947
Nothing.

464
00:30:01,004 --> 00:30:02,410
We're all good.

465
00:30:10,707 --> 00:30:14,003
You never told me that.

466
00:30:14,004 --> 00:30:15,003
You can't say anything.

467
00:30:15,004 --> 00:30:18,003
Danny will kill me
if he finds out I told you.

468
00:30:18,004 --> 00:30:20,004
Hmm.

469
00:30:22,188 --> 00:30:23,987
You're beautiful.

470
00:30:26,584 --> 00:30:28,591
- You're drunk.
- No, I'm not.

471
00:30:31,004 --> 00:30:33,003
I'm a middle-aged single mom.

472
00:30:33,004 --> 00:30:35,004
That should be enough to scare you off.

473
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:38,541
You want to scare me away?

474
00:30:41,289 --> 00:30:43,424
Danny warned me about you.

475
00:30:44,771 --> 00:30:45,770
Did he?

476
00:30:45,771 --> 00:30:47,770
Yeah. Said you were trouble.

477
00:30:47,771 --> 00:30:49,681
Oh, I'm definitely trouble.

478
00:30:50,771 --> 00:30:52,517
There's no doubt about that.

479
00:31:03,489 --> 00:31:04,770
Um...

480
00:31:05,692 --> 00:31:06,770
I need to get home.

481
00:31:06,771 --> 00:31:09,770
Can't leave my babysitter
waiting any longer.

482
00:31:10,106 --> 00:31:11,770
Sure.

483
00:31:11,771 --> 00:31:12,771
Yeah.

484
00:31:20,273 --> 00:31:22,888
That was nice. Thank you.

485
00:31:24,081 --> 00:31:26,771
Would it be inappropriate
if I called you sometime?

486
00:31:29,496 --> 00:31:31,433
If you insist.

487
00:31:36,442 --> 00:31:37,770
Good night.

488
00:31:37,771 --> 00:31:38,771
Good night.

489
00:32:08,771 --> 00:32:09,770
Trip okay?

490
00:32:09,771 --> 00:32:11,260
We managed.

491
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:15,770
Everything arranged
at the drop-off point?

492
00:32:15,771 --> 00:32:17,770
Yes, ma'am. Everything ready
and waiting in Beijing.

493
00:32:17,771 --> 00:32:19,770
Beijing?! What the fuck?!

494
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:21,770
You said I was going to United States!

495
00:32:21,771 --> 00:32:22,770
I lied.

496
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:24,770
You cannot send me back there.

497
00:32:24,771 --> 00:32:26,770
The moment I step foot on Chinese soil,

498
00:32:26,771 --> 00:32:28,770
they take me to labor camp and I die.

499
00:32:28,771 --> 00:32:29,770
If you're lucky.

500
00:32:37,771 --> 00:32:39,728
You could use a drink.

501
00:32:41,108 --> 00:32:42,770
Is that an invitation?

502
00:32:43,288 --> 00:32:45,001
Maybe.

503
00:32:47,426 --> 00:32:50,770
I left Germany once.

504
00:32:51,478 --> 00:32:53,770
I packed everything I owned
into a suitcase

505
00:32:53,771 --> 00:32:56,321
and bought a one-way ticket
to Patagonia.

506
00:32:57,145 --> 00:32:59,770
Why Patagonia? Apart from the obvious.

507
00:32:59,771 --> 00:33:01,770
Childish whim.

508
00:33:02,446 --> 00:33:05,069
In my mind,
it was the epitome of beauty.

509
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:08,770
How long did you stay for?

510
00:33:08,771 --> 00:33:10,770
Only a week.

511
00:33:11,251 --> 00:33:13,770
I received a call.
Father had fallen ill.

512
00:33:14,587 --> 00:33:16,923
Felt obligated to return to Germany.

513
00:33:17,771 --> 00:33:19,793
He was furious with me.

514
00:33:20,771 --> 00:33:22,770
What, for going home or for
leaving in the first place?

515
00:33:22,771 --> 00:33:26,770
No, that I saw him as week,
someone in need of help.

516
00:33:26,771 --> 00:33:29,770
He wouldn't allow me to
enter his hospital room.

517
00:33:29,771 --> 00:33:31,771
Died the next morning.

518
00:33:33,231 --> 00:33:35,095
Oh. Sorry.

519
00:33:38,398 --> 00:33:40,770
Is any part of that story true?

520
00:33:40,771 --> 00:33:43,822
Yeah, some of it.

521
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:46,770
I did the same thing.

522
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:48,770
When I moved back to the States,

523
00:33:48,771 --> 00:33:51,770
I told people my mom died of cancer.

524
00:33:51,771 --> 00:33:52,770
Why?

525
00:33:53,378 --> 00:33:56,320
Because when your mom

526
00:33:56,321 --> 00:33:58,313
dies the way mine did,

527
00:33:59,457 --> 00:34:01,307
it leads to questions...

528
00:34:02,265 --> 00:34:04,626
Who did it? Did she burn alive?

529
00:34:05,771 --> 00:34:06,770
Were her limbs blown off?

530
00:34:08,018 --> 00:34:10,770
Questions you didn't
know the answers to.

531
00:34:10,771 --> 00:34:13,344
Questions I didn't want to deal with.

532
00:34:14,771 --> 00:34:17,770
But everybody understands
the word "cancer."

533
00:34:18,161 --> 00:34:20,770
Kids empathized, felt badly for me.

534
00:34:22,113 --> 00:34:25,771
At 12, I wanted that more
than anything in the world.

535
00:34:28,481 --> 00:34:31,047
Yeah. Thanks.

536
00:34:41,771 --> 00:34:43,770
Nice.

537
00:34:43,771 --> 00:34:46,771
Yeah, my family's been
in Germany a long time.

538
00:34:50,771 --> 00:34:51,770
Is this you?

539
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:53,771
Yeah.

540
00:34:55,241 --> 00:34:56,771
You look happy.

541
00:34:59,076 --> 00:35:00,546
I was.

542
00:35:02,771 --> 00:35:04,127
Here.

543
00:35:05,771 --> 00:35:06,770
Danke schoen.

544
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:08,017
Bitte schoen.

545
00:35:09,771 --> 00:35:11,771
- Prost.
- Prost.

546
00:35:28,771 --> 00:35:30,770
You're different than I was expecting.

547
00:35:30,771 --> 00:35:31,957
Really?

548
00:35:33,771 --> 00:35:35,950
What were you expecting?

549
00:35:39,771 --> 00:35:41,221
To despise you.

550
00:35:42,771 --> 00:35:43,771
And instead?

551
00:36:53,771 --> 00:36:54,590
Yeah.

552
00:37:23,771 --> 00:37:25,770
- How old are you?
- 16.

553
00:37:25,771 --> 00:37:29,770
That's unfortunate.
Try you as an adult, you know?

554
00:37:30,342 --> 00:37:31,985
Try me for what?

555
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:37,389
For joining the banned
Islamic terrorist group Daesh.

556
00:37:40,094 --> 00:37:41,770
Where's Sabina?

557
00:37:59,771 --> 00:38:01,771
Okay.

558
00:39:05,771 --> 00:39:08,770
They've whored themselves
out to Western culture.

559
00:39:09,469 --> 00:39:12,770
They shove McDonald's hamburgers
down their throats,

560
00:39:12,771 --> 00:39:14,770
walk through Christmas markets,

561
00:39:14,965 --> 00:39:18,770
and still they try to call
themselves devout Muslims.

562
00:39:19,981 --> 00:39:22,894
If anyone should be ashamed
of their family, it's me.

563
00:39:25,958 --> 00:39:28,445
Do you feel responsible for Lin?

564
00:39:30,678 --> 00:39:32,313
Why should I?

565
00:39:33,771 --> 00:39:34,770
Because we knew from the beginning

566
00:39:34,771 --> 00:39:36,771
we were sending him back.

567
00:39:38,429 --> 00:39:39,770
It's a job.

568
00:39:40,105 --> 00:39:42,208
Doesn't relieve you of the guilt.

569
00:39:43,771 --> 00:39:45,035
It does for me.

570
00:39:46,587 --> 00:39:48,770
What's important to Germany
is more important

571
00:39:48,771 --> 00:39:50,264
than my petty emotion.

572
00:39:51,354 --> 00:39:52,771
To what end?

573
00:39:53,771 --> 00:39:55,012
There isn't one.

574
00:39:55,598 --> 00:39:57,770
Historically,
that really hasn't worked out

575
00:39:57,771 --> 00:39:58,770
so well for you guys.

576
00:39:58,771 --> 00:39:59,770
Hey.

577
00:40:00,456 --> 00:40:02,771
May I remind you that you're in my bed?

578
00:40:06,256 --> 00:40:08,770
Lin comes to us

579
00:40:09,408 --> 00:40:11,752
looking for a way out, a new life.

580
00:40:12,771 --> 00:40:14,241
What do we do?

581
00:40:14,771 --> 00:40:15,770
Bleed him dry,

582
00:40:15,771 --> 00:40:18,353
sacrifice him to save ourselves.

583
00:40:20,056 --> 00:40:21,770
What the fuck happened to our integrity?

584
00:40:22,888 --> 00:40:24,770
It's no longer important
to do what's right.

585
00:40:25,336 --> 00:40:27,770
The only thing that matters
is that we don't get caught

586
00:40:27,771 --> 00:40:29,105
doing something wrong.

587
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,771
Got to admit the system's fucked.

588
00:40:37,688 --> 00:40:40,771
You're starting to
sound like Thomas Shaw.

589
00:41:11,771 --> 00:41:16,770
You do know you're looking
at about 5 to 10 years prison,

590
00:41:17,087 --> 00:41:18,771
bare minimum.

591
00:41:19,771 --> 00:41:20,770
Allah will protect me.

592
00:41:20,771 --> 00:41:22,770
And what about Sabina?

593
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:25,401
Girl like that won't last
very long, Daayna.

594
00:41:26,385 --> 00:41:28,771
This was my idea, not hers.

595
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:38,771
You want to protect your friend,
tell me about Ruth Iosava.

596
00:41:40,771 --> 00:41:42,168
We pray together.

597
00:41:42,771 --> 00:41:44,770
But she was gonna help you, wasn't she?

598
00:41:45,275 --> 00:41:46,420
Once you got to Istanbul,

599
00:41:46,421 --> 00:41:47,770
Ruth's friends were gonna meet you

600
00:41:47,771 --> 00:41:49,770
and accompany you to the border.

601
00:41:49,771 --> 00:41:50,770
Then what?

602
00:41:51,215 --> 00:41:53,928
Your boyfriend was gonna meet
you and take you to Palmyra?

603
00:41:55,944 --> 00:41:58,440
Allah will protect Sabina, too.

604
00:42:05,771 --> 00:42:10,771
Fu-u-u-ck.

605
00:42:45,262 --> 00:42:47,771
That was nice. Thank you.

606
00:42:50,485 --> 00:42:51,770
You want something to drink?

607
00:42:51,771 --> 00:42:54,771
I ca... I can make you a cup of coffee.

608
00:42:57,474 --> 00:42:59,651
Take that as a hard no.

609
00:43:06,771 --> 00:43:10,152
I-I'm sorry. I don't...
I don't know what you're saying.

610
00:43:11,771 --> 00:43:13,770
Um, y-you're welcome to stay.

611
00:43:13,771 --> 00:43:15,770
I-I was gonna make myself
some breakfast.

612
00:43:16,279 --> 00:43:17,770
Maybe some eggs and bacon.

613
00:43:18,138 --> 00:43:19,770
Pancakes.

614
00:44:34,310 --> 00:44:35,965
Get dressed.

615
00:44:37,463 --> 00:44:38,462
We're leaving.

616
00:44:38,573 --> 00:44:39,965
Where are we going?

617
00:44:41,404 --> 00:44:44,338
Now what? Can't
hold them here much longer.

618
00:44:44,339 --> 00:44:46,281
The parents are gonna
start asking questions.

619
00:44:47,417 --> 00:44:48,770
Could take their passports.

620
00:44:48,771 --> 00:44:50,770
Other ways to get out of the country

621
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:52,273
if they want it bad enough.

622
00:44:54,241 --> 00:44:55,770
There's nothing we can charge them with?

623
00:44:55,771 --> 00:44:58,770
Traveling to a conflict zone
isn't illegal.

624
00:44:59,410 --> 00:45:01,770
We have nothing on paper
alluding to any sort

625
00:45:01,771 --> 00:45:03,770
of future terrorism or violence.

626
00:45:03,771 --> 00:45:05,996
Some worthless online love letters.

627
00:45:06,771 --> 00:45:07,771
We calling it?

628
00:45:11,650 --> 00:45:13,650
No. Not yet.

629
00:45:44,102 --> 00:45:47,770
Your refugees were
on their way to Syria.

630
00:45:47,771 --> 00:45:52,770
Daayna and Sabina...
two 16-year-old girls.

631
00:45:53,111 --> 00:45:57,200
All thanks to
your generous contribution.

632
00:46:02,164 --> 00:46:04,770
I wanted to believe
and do the right thing.

633
00:46:05,139 --> 00:46:06,868
Naive no longer.

634
00:46:08,364 --> 00:46:09,770
And to be perfectly blunt,

635
00:46:10,452 --> 00:46:12,999
you no longer have
the luxury of options.

636
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:15,770
So, you will stay and play

637
00:46:15,771 --> 00:46:17,883
and you will force Iosava's hand.

638
00:46:50,771 --> 00:46:53,771
Tell Tel Aviv they have
my full support going forward.

639
00:46:56,771 --> 00:46:58,770
Why the change of heart?

640
00:46:59,168 --> 00:47:00,770
The Agency's fucked.

641
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:04,770
Everyone's more concerned
with self-preservation

642
00:47:04,771 --> 00:47:07,192
than they are with
gathering real intelligence.

643
00:47:08,465 --> 00:47:10,704
Partially as a result of Shaw,

644
00:47:11,771 --> 00:47:13,920
partially poor leadership.

645
00:47:15,771 --> 00:47:16,770
Whatever.

646
00:47:17,408 --> 00:47:20,649
I can accomplish much more
with you than I can with them.

647
00:47:22,376 --> 00:47:24,770
Their shortcoming is our gain.

648
00:47:25,607 --> 00:47:28,752
The Americans made the mistake
of finding you expendable.

649
00:47:29,771 --> 00:47:30,770
We will not.

650
00:47:31,321 --> 00:47:33,771
Name your price. Money's no object.

651
00:47:36,352 --> 00:47:38,238
I don't want your money.

652
00:47:39,771 --> 00:47:41,496
What do you want?

653
00:47:46,068 --> 00:47:47,731
I'll be in touch.

654
00:48:03,771 --> 00:48:05,770
Do you know where we are?

655
00:48:06,532 --> 00:48:08,771
My mom died on that asphalt.

656
00:48:12,388 --> 00:48:14,739
I never made it to Patagonia.

657
00:48:16,179 --> 00:48:19,116
Went as far as the airport,
but never got on the plane.

658
00:48:20,771 --> 00:48:23,971
It was something my father and I
were planning on doing together.

659
00:48:25,149 --> 00:48:26,987
But he died before we could.

660
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:30,708
Why did you bring me here?

661
00:48:32,862 --> 00:48:35,770
The GDR took great pride

662
00:48:35,771 --> 00:48:38,075
in those embedded west of the wall.

663
00:48:39,001 --> 00:48:40,770
Risking their lives for the cause.

664
00:48:40,771 --> 00:48:42,770
The dead became martyrs.

665
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:47,207
One by the name Lukas Becker.

666
00:48:48,948 --> 00:48:50,365
Your mother

667
00:48:51,596 --> 00:48:52,770
was sleeping with a Stasi spy.

668
00:48:52,771 --> 00:48:54,771
He was developing her.

669
00:48:58,771 --> 00:49:00,711
You think you're clever?

670
00:49:02,490 --> 00:49:03,765
You're not.

671
00:49:05,245 --> 00:49:07,093
You're transparent.

672
00:49:09,187 --> 00:49:14,771
Feeding me childhood secrets
in the hopes of what?

673
00:49:15,771 --> 00:49:17,259
Working me?

674
00:49:19,263 --> 00:49:21,259
You still don't trust me.

675
00:49:22,771 --> 00:49:23,955
No.

676
00:49:25,612 --> 00:49:27,553
I-I don't.

677
00:49:56,771 --> 00:49:58,771
Jesus Christ.

678
00:49:59,771 --> 00:50:01,266
Hey!

679
00:50:14,119 --> 00:50:16,770
You listen to me.
This will never happen again.

680
00:50:16,771 --> 00:50:18,142
Do you hear me?

681
00:50:19,326 --> 00:50:20,774
Never.

682
00:50:41,771 --> 00:50:43,770
There you go.

683
00:50:43,771 --> 00:50:45,623
I think...

684
00:50:47,194 --> 00:50:48,770
There.

685
00:50:48,771 --> 00:50:51,771
It's okay. I got you.

686
00:51:05,301 --> 00:51:13,356
