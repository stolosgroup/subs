<i>Previously on "Berlin Station"...</i>

2
00:00:08,674 --> 00:00:10,993
Have my husband on the line
in exactly 60 minutes

3
00:00:10,994 --> 00:00:12,993
or Clare here dies.

4
00:00:12,994 --> 00:00:14,993
We're at a loss here, Clay.

5
00:00:14,994 --> 00:00:16,993
The only way to get her back
is to swap for Iosava.

6
00:00:16,994 --> 00:00:18,993
We can't trade what we don't have.

7
00:00:18,994 --> 00:00:20,679
Hector, we need you.

8
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,993
There is no fucking "we"
anymore, Daniel.

9
00:00:23,994 --> 00:00:24,993
Let me go after him.

10
00:00:24,994 --> 00:00:26,993
If Hector's out there
acting on his emotions,

11
00:00:26,994 --> 00:00:27,993
she's as good as dead.

12
00:00:27,994 --> 00:00:29,993
Okay, all right, just tread lightly.

13
00:00:29,994 --> 00:00:32,993
I need the file from December 7, 2010,

14
00:00:32,994 --> 00:00:35,590
- code name "Antoinette."
- A woman's life is on the line,

15
00:00:35,591 --> 00:00:36,993
you're asking me
to steal you a fucking file?

16
00:00:36,994 --> 00:00:39,993
- Hey.
- Where's Ruth Iosava, Metin?

17
00:00:39,994 --> 00:00:41,993
Okay.

18
00:00:44,994 --> 00:00:46,993
We had a deal, Steven. Now we don't!

19
00:00:46,994 --> 00:00:48,993
- Don't. I'm telling you...
- Shut up!

20
00:00:48,994 --> 00:00:50,993
There's a way out,
but if you pull the trigger...

21
00:00:53,994 --> 00:00:55,993
Let her go.

22
00:00:56,994 --> 00:00:57,993
Oh, fuck!

23
00:00:59,994 --> 00:01:00,993
- No.
- I'm sorry.

24
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:02,993
No, no, no, no.

25
00:01:02,994 --> 00:01:03,993
No.

26
00:01:03,994 --> 00:01:05,993
- Hector, you're better than this.
- No, I'm not.

27
00:01:05,994 --> 00:01:10,993
I'm the worst this fucked-up
agency has to offer.

28
00:01:14,994 --> 00:01:16,993
I know the Americans renditioned Iosava.

29
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:18,993
Brace yourself for the consequences.

30
00:01:18,994 --> 00:01:20,993
<i>A new leak has named Steven Frost</i>

31
00:01:20,994 --> 00:01:22,994
<i>as chief of the CIA station in Berlin.</i>

32
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,915
_

33
00:01:27,994 --> 00:01:29,993
You and me
joined at the hip again...

34
00:01:29,994 --> 00:01:31,993
That's either fate
or a cosmically bad idea.

35
00:01:31,994 --> 00:01:34,994
With you, Hector,
it's one and the same thing.

State your name for the record.

00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,859
Hector Owen DeJean.

40
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,438
Do you know why you've been called in

41
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:38,859
- for questioning, Mr. DeJean?
- "Called in?"

42
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,859
That's liberal.

43
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:41,998
Answer the question.

44
00:02:42,681 --> 00:02:45,378
Op goes bad. Agency's first response

45
00:02:45,403 --> 00:02:47,860
is always to cover its ass.

46
00:02:55,261 --> 00:02:57,248
Let's start from the beginning.

47
00:02:59,628 --> 00:03:00,627
You showed up on an operation

48
00:03:00,628 --> 00:03:02,627
after being specifically told not to.

49
00:03:03,233 --> 00:03:04,577
Correct.

50
00:03:05,628 --> 00:03:07,627
- What happened next?
- You saw the tapes.

51
00:03:07,628 --> 00:03:09,627
It went south fast.

52
00:03:09,628 --> 00:03:11,627
We were made the moment
Fawn walked in the door.

53
00:03:11,628 --> 00:03:13,628
Which takes us to two nights ago.

54
00:03:16,238 --> 00:03:18,627
Steven Frost instructed you to back down

55
00:03:18,628 --> 00:03:20,627
after, and I quote, "DeJean showed brash

56
00:03:20,628 --> 00:03:22,627
and unpredictable behavior,

57
00:03:22,628 --> 00:03:24,627
making him a liability
to our negotiation."

58
00:03:24,628 --> 00:03:26,726
- Did you back down?
- I did not.

59
00:03:27,465 --> 00:03:29,307
You began an unsanctioned investigation

60
00:03:29,308 --> 00:03:33,087
into the whereabouts
of Clare Itani a.k.a. Fawn.

61
00:03:33,931 --> 00:03:35,627
Is that a question?

62
00:03:35,628 --> 00:03:36,874
Did you have any assistance?

63
00:03:37,327 --> 00:03:38,986
Yeah. Daniel Miller.

64
00:03:39,628 --> 00:03:40,987
What was your plan?

65
00:03:41,628 --> 00:03:43,627
There was no plan.

66
00:03:43,628 --> 00:03:45,627
We did what needed to be done.

67
00:03:45,628 --> 00:03:48,303
We loaded up with non-station weapons.

68
00:03:48,304 --> 00:03:50,627
I performed an enhanced interrogation,

69
00:03:50,628 --> 00:03:52,941
and we were given
Fawn's exact location...

70
00:03:54,628 --> 00:03:56,627
...a warehouse in Wedding.

71
00:03:56,628 --> 00:03:58,320
When you arrived at the warehouse,

72
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:00,627
did you come into contact
with Ruth Iosava?

73
00:04:00,628 --> 00:04:02,780
Nope. She wasn't there.

74
00:04:04,628 --> 00:04:07,098
The timing of your arrival coincides

75
00:04:07,099 --> 00:04:10,116
with the exact moment that
the feed to the SCIF went dead.

76
00:04:10,117 --> 00:04:11,927
I wasn't aware of that.

77
00:04:12,628 --> 00:04:14,627
You didn't see Ruth Iosava flee?

78
00:04:14,628 --> 00:04:16,543
No contact whatsoever?

79
00:04:17,628 --> 00:04:20,327
My focus wasn't on Ruth Iosava.

80
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:25,008
Is it safe to say that
your focus was on Clare Itani?

81
00:04:26,087 --> 00:04:28,215
That would be safe to say.

82
00:04:48,097 --> 00:04:51,628
What condition was Clare Itani
in when you arrived?

83
00:04:59,206 --> 00:05:00,628
She was dead.

84
00:05:05,158 --> 00:05:08,627
<i>Sir, Clay Williams will be
calling momentarily.</i>

85
00:05:09,628 --> 00:05:14,627
Robert, I'm looking
at a station in utter disarray.

86
00:05:14,628 --> 00:05:16,627
A shootout in the mall.

87
00:05:16,628 --> 00:05:17,627
A dead NOC.

88
00:05:18,018 --> 00:05:19,195
And to top it off,

89
00:05:19,196 --> 00:05:21,286
the Chief of Station is in the wind.

90
00:05:21,628 --> 00:05:23,627
It's one thing to hide from the Germans,

91
00:05:23,628 --> 00:05:25,627
but hiding from the agency,

92
00:05:25,628 --> 00:05:27,627
that feels counterintuitive.

93
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:30,099
Frost is pissing off a lot of people

94
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,627
that you don't want to piss off.

95
00:05:32,536 --> 00:05:34,417
Now, I'm gonna give you
the benefit of the doubt

96
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:37,123
and assume that he has not
contacted you.

97
00:05:37,124 --> 00:05:39,052
No. He has not.

98
00:05:39,628 --> 00:05:42,055
This isn't the time
for divided loyalties.

99
00:05:42,428 --> 00:05:44,627
You asked me a question,
and I gave you an answer.

100
00:05:45,448 --> 00:05:48,060
You have my word that I will do
everything in my power

101
00:05:48,061 --> 00:05:51,627
to make sure Steven Frost
makes his way safely back home.

102
00:05:51,628 --> 00:05:53,627
What more can I say?

103
00:05:53,628 --> 00:05:54,627
Last thing.

104
00:05:55,227 --> 00:05:57,627
There are folks at my end
who are questioning

105
00:05:57,628 --> 00:06:00,087
whether or not you can handle this.

106
00:06:01,135 --> 00:06:02,627
Can you?

107
00:06:03,323 --> 00:06:05,627
You tell those folks, without question,

108
00:06:06,144 --> 00:06:07,627
I can.

109
00:06:07,628 --> 00:06:09,181
I've got this.

110
00:06:13,628 --> 00:06:14,927
Danny!

111
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,433
How was Munich?

112
00:06:21,628 --> 00:06:24,198
My ex is a pompous ass,

113
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:26,106
and his new girlfriend
is barely out of her teens,

114
00:06:26,107 --> 00:06:27,627
but other than that, it was delightful.

115
00:06:27,628 --> 00:06:29,627
- Was Max okay?
- Thrilled.

116
00:06:29,628 --> 00:06:32,627
His dad knows how to turn on
the charm. Never get married.

117
00:06:32,628 --> 00:06:35,181
Marriage isn't your problem.
It's your choice in men.

118
00:06:35,182 --> 00:06:37,127
Speaking of,

119
00:06:37,128 --> 00:06:39,135
I just ran into Hector
a couple days ago.

120
00:06:39,136 --> 00:06:40,627
We had a glass of wine. It was nice.

121
00:06:40,628 --> 00:06:43,627
So, are you two seeing each other now?

122
00:06:43,628 --> 00:06:46,627
I'm hoping he keeps me company
in Max's absence.

123
00:06:46,628 --> 00:06:49,024
Look, I'd prefer it
if you stayed away from Hector.

124
00:06:49,352 --> 00:06:50,627
You'd prefer it?

125
00:06:51,097 --> 00:06:52,627
Okay I'll be honest.

126
00:06:52,628 --> 00:06:54,958
Hector's gotten himself
into some deep shit,

127
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:56,627
the kind of shit you don't get out of.

128
00:06:56,628 --> 00:06:57,627
- What kind of shit?
- I...

129
00:06:57,628 --> 00:06:59,627
Specifically?

130
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:00,627
Why are you being so difficult?

131
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:02,627
I'm just trying to protect you.

132
00:07:02,628 --> 00:07:04,341
I never asked for your protection.

133
00:07:04,342 --> 00:07:06,627
Danny, I'm all grown up.
And what you think is best for me,

134
00:07:06,628 --> 00:07:09,627
what I think is best...
Those are two very different things.

135
00:07:09,628 --> 00:07:12,627
Okay, well, whatever you think
he's involved in,

136
00:07:12,628 --> 00:07:13,627
it's worse.

137
00:07:14,216 --> 00:07:17,627
I appreciate your concern.
But it's my choice.

138
00:07:17,628 --> 00:07:19,627
Not yours.

139
00:07:19,628 --> 00:07:21,627
And I like him.

140
00:07:21,628 --> 00:07:23,628
So you like assholes.

141
00:07:29,628 --> 00:07:32,092
Have you ever had
psychological treatment?

142
00:07:33,455 --> 00:07:35,455
It's all in my file.

143
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:39,627
"DeJean suffered PTSD

144
00:07:39,628 --> 00:07:42,544
from his time stationed in North Africa.

145
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:45,627
It manifested itself in anxiety attacks,

146
00:07:45,628 --> 00:07:47,853
insomnia, and delusions.

147
00:07:48,628 --> 00:07:50,973
Followed by
a subsequent leave of absence."

148
00:07:51,628 --> 00:07:53,125
Can you describe the delusions?

149
00:07:53,997 --> 00:07:55,485
It's fucking textbook.

150
00:07:55,486 --> 00:07:58,044
You... see something traumatic,

151
00:07:58,045 --> 00:07:59,194
it leads to nightmares.

152
00:07:59,195 --> 00:08:00,627
Nightmares lead to insomnia.

153
00:08:00,628 --> 00:08:04,627
When you don't sleep, you see
all kinds of weird shit.

154
00:08:04,866 --> 00:08:06,498
God bless Ambien.

155
00:08:07,628 --> 00:08:10,047
Did the psychological treatment
prove effective?

156
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:11,628
Sure. Yeah.

157
00:08:12,628 --> 00:08:14,007
How?

158
00:08:16,628 --> 00:08:18,627
Forced me to reevaluate.

159
00:08:18,628 --> 00:08:19,780
Reevaluate what?

160
00:08:21,074 --> 00:08:22,628
The Agency?

161
00:08:25,628 --> 00:08:27,663
Myself.

162
00:08:32,174 --> 00:08:34,251
Could I get everybody's
attention, please?

163
00:08:34,252 --> 00:08:36,001
Heads up. Over here.

164
00:08:36,628 --> 00:08:37,912
Thank you.

165
00:08:38,628 --> 00:08:40,016
I just, uh...

166
00:08:42,337 --> 00:08:45,627
Look, this is a dark day
in Berlin Station.

167
00:08:46,072 --> 00:08:48,576
For the loss of our colleague
Clare Itani.

168
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:52,627
Not only was she a great asset
to this agency,

169
00:08:52,628 --> 00:08:55,277
she was also a dear friend

170
00:08:55,278 --> 00:08:57,627
to many of you here in this office.

171
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:02,131
I know this is also,
a-a-a very confusing day

172
00:09:02,132 --> 00:09:05,136
for the absence of our Chief,
Steven Frost.

173
00:09:05,926 --> 00:09:08,045
I don't really know
what to say about that.

174
00:09:08,487 --> 00:09:10,627
I don't have much information
at this point.

175
00:09:10,628 --> 00:09:13,628
I-I hope to know more very soon.

176
00:09:15,394 --> 00:09:18,393
But in the meantime,

177
00:09:18,988 --> 00:09:21,972
as your Chief
for the foreseeable future,

178
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:25,627
I want to assure you
as I just assured Headquarters

179
00:09:26,214 --> 00:09:29,628
everything is under control, okay?

180
00:10:05,351 --> 00:10:07,158
Hey, uh, I have to go out for a minute.

181
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:09,165
So if you need me I'll be on my mobile.

182
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:10,791
Dare I ask where you're going?

183
00:10:12,453 --> 00:10:14,627
I'm following up on a now-deceased NOC.

184
00:10:14,628 --> 00:10:15,627
Right.

185
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:19,627
How's that, uh, all going for you,

186
00:10:19,628 --> 00:10:21,627
with Clare and everything?

187
00:10:21,628 --> 00:10:23,422
As a professional courtesy,

188
00:10:23,423 --> 00:10:25,627
would you please just treat me
the way you normally do?

189
00:10:25,628 --> 00:10:28,902
Look, I know we have our differences,

190
00:10:28,903 --> 00:10:32,627
but, um, I don't want this
new role as acting Chief

191
00:10:32,628 --> 00:10:35,972
to be a source of friction
or resentment between us.

192
00:10:36,628 --> 00:10:38,227
Are we done here?

193
00:10:39,628 --> 00:10:40,844
Chief?

194
00:11:31,628 --> 00:11:33,627
Jesus!

195
00:11:33,628 --> 00:11:35,103
Jesus, Hector.

196
00:11:35,628 --> 00:11:37,627
For fuck's sake.

197
00:11:41,628 --> 00:11:43,627
Have you been here this whole time?

198
00:11:43,628 --> 00:11:44,956
A while.

199
00:11:46,628 --> 00:11:48,627
What are you doing?

200
00:11:48,628 --> 00:11:50,973
Packing up some of Clare's things.

201
00:11:52,102 --> 00:11:53,628
Why?

202
00:11:55,963 --> 00:11:57,627
'Cause I couldn't stomach the idea

203
00:11:57,628 --> 00:12:00,571
of the Agency cleaning crew
coming in to do it.

204
00:12:02,048 --> 00:12:05,196
That little shit used to
hide all of her favorite things.

205
00:12:05,372 --> 00:12:06,372
I know.

206
00:12:25,382 --> 00:12:27,382
She loved you.

207
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:35,957
She never said it.

208
00:12:38,045 --> 00:12:39,886
I did once.

209
00:12:41,628 --> 00:12:43,454
Well, she told me.

210
00:12:45,341 --> 00:12:47,627
If you're saying that
to make me feel better,

211
00:12:47,628 --> 00:12:48,627
please don't.

212
00:12:48,986 --> 00:12:50,628
It's the truth.

213
00:12:53,628 --> 00:12:55,980
She would've fucking hated this.

214
00:12:57,628 --> 00:12:59,315
You and I, sitting here,

215
00:12:59,316 --> 00:13:02,139
talking about our feelings
at her expense.

216
00:13:07,628 --> 00:13:09,627
Well, I'd give anything to have her back

217
00:13:09,628 --> 00:13:11,373
so she could just flip us off.

218
00:13:12,628 --> 00:13:14,628
Me fucking too.

219
00:13:19,983 --> 00:13:21,627
You drink alcohol?

220
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:24,627
I imbibe from time to time.

221
00:13:24,628 --> 00:13:26,627
Would you consider yourself
an alcoholic?

222
00:13:26,628 --> 00:13:28,643
Absolutely not.

223
00:13:29,628 --> 00:13:32,627
Some may say I have
alcoholic tendencies.

224
00:13:33,128 --> 00:13:35,269
Have those tendencies ever interfered

225
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:38,230
with your job as a case officer?

226
00:13:38,499 --> 00:13:39,499
No.

227
00:13:42,858 --> 00:13:45,076
Open for interpretation.

228
00:13:58,628 --> 00:14:00,627
Is that supposed to be a peace offering?

229
00:14:00,628 --> 00:14:02,628
You said you liked Ulrich's rosé.

230
00:14:05,628 --> 00:14:07,627
You know it wasn't my doing.

231
00:14:07,628 --> 00:14:09,628
The mood is vindictive.

232
00:14:12,628 --> 00:14:14,627
I told them this is a business
of relationship,

233
00:14:14,628 --> 00:14:18,627
that I know Steven,
and it wasn't his fault.

234
00:14:18,628 --> 00:14:21,627
Then why did you ask them
to lift his diplomatic immunity?

235
00:14:21,628 --> 00:14:23,627
I did no such thing.

236
00:14:24,051 --> 00:14:27,128
My protest fell on deaf ears.

237
00:14:27,504 --> 00:14:29,003
I need to find him.

238
00:14:29,628 --> 00:14:30,627
Me.

239
00:14:30,943 --> 00:14:34,147
And when I do, I'll hand him
over to the CIA.

240
00:14:35,628 --> 00:14:38,066
But if someone else finds him,
to be blunt,

241
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:41,627
the BFV wants him to rot
in a German prison.

242
00:14:42,218 --> 00:14:45,058
If you can't tell me where he is...

243
00:14:45,963 --> 00:14:49,091
- I don't know where he is.
- If you can't tell me,

244
00:14:49,628 --> 00:14:51,627
then at least get a message to him.

245
00:14:51,628 --> 00:14:53,034
He has my number.

246
00:14:53,628 --> 00:14:55,706
I don't know where he is, Hans.

247
00:14:56,628 --> 00:14:59,322
So I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

248
00:15:02,628 --> 00:15:04,930
I'm sorry you feel that way.

249
00:15:08,628 --> 00:15:10,287
Oh, and tell your utility workers

250
00:15:10,288 --> 00:15:12,779
they're not as secretive
as they think they are.

251
00:15:15,076 --> 00:15:17,628
Tell him to call me.

252
00:16:59,985 --> 00:17:02,145
<i>You're a ship
without a harbor, buddy.</i>

253
00:17:03,271 --> 00:17:05,158
<i>You don't want to do this alone, Daniel,</i>

254
00:17:05,159 --> 00:17:06,627
<i>particularly now.</i>

255
00:17:06,628 --> 00:17:08,628
<i>One more Shaw leak and...</i>

256
00:17:11,323 --> 00:17:13,627
<i>You're different
than I was expecting.</i>

257
00:17:13,628 --> 00:17:16,627
<i>Really? What were you expecting?</i>

258
00:17:17,191 --> 00:17:18,627
<i>To despise you.</i>

259
00:17:18,628 --> 00:17:20,628
<i>And instead?</i>

260
00:17:22,976 --> 00:17:25,133
<i>Something about you
just doesn't add up.</i>

261
00:17:25,134 --> 00:17:26,627
<i>I'm just doin' my job.</i>

262
00:17:27,136 --> 00:17:29,627
<i>Finding Thomas Shaw is not your job.</i>

263
00:17:29,628 --> 00:17:30,851
<i>It's your cause. Why?</i>

264
00:17:31,358 --> 00:17:32,627
<i>For 10 years, you're...</i>

265
00:17:33,286 --> 00:17:34,627
<i>You have a cushy analyst job. 10 years!</i>

266
00:17:34,628 --> 00:17:37,876
<i>Then one day when you wake up,
you say, "Gee, you know,</i>

267
00:17:37,877 --> 00:17:39,627
<i>I-I think I'd like
to go back in the field."</i>

268
00:17:39,628 --> 00:17:41,628
<i>Thanks for the file.</i>

269
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:49,627
<i>Testing, testing.
One, two, three.</i>

270
00:17:55,553 --> 00:17:58,134
<i>What, I have to ask
if I want another round, huh?</i>

271
00:17:58,135 --> 00:17:59,627
<i>Does the Pope shit in the woods?</i>

272
00:17:59,628 --> 00:18:01,627
<i>Is the bear a Catholic?</i>

273
00:18:04,628 --> 00:18:07,627
<i>- Perfect!
- Whoo-hoo!</i>

274
00:18:17,628 --> 00:18:20,948
Sandra, can I ask you a question?

275
00:18:21,628 --> 00:18:22,984
Peter Felder.

276
00:18:23,747 --> 00:18:25,449
Excuse me?

277
00:18:25,474 --> 00:18:26,627
The answer to your question.

278
00:18:26,628 --> 00:18:28,627
You want to know where Steven is.

279
00:18:28,628 --> 00:18:31,769
I don't know. But if there's
anyone that does, it's Peter.

280
00:18:32,628 --> 00:18:33,627
Thank you.

281
00:18:34,018 --> 00:18:35,627
And, Daniel...

282
00:18:35,628 --> 00:18:38,178
don't make me regret confiding in you.

283
00:18:50,305 --> 00:18:51,644
_

284
00:18:51,944 --> 00:18:56,507
_

285
00:18:56,628 --> 00:18:58,628
Uh-huh.

286
00:19:00,579 --> 00:19:04,456
_

287
00:19:14,901 --> 00:19:16,901
_

288
00:19:17,128 --> 00:19:18,808
_

289
00:19:23,101 --> 00:19:25,534
Steven, it's me again.

290
00:19:25,535 --> 00:19:26,648
It's Robert.

291
00:19:27,628 --> 00:19:30,627
What the fuck, Steven? Where are you?

292
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:32,377
I need you to call me back.

293
00:19:32,402 --> 00:19:34,627
You know, the Germans are
breathing down my neck.

294
00:19:34,628 --> 00:19:35,990
Langley's up my ass.

295
00:19:36,628 --> 00:19:38,627
You know what? Fuck them.

296
00:19:38,628 --> 00:19:40,627
Fuck... Fuck all of them.
We need to get you out

297
00:19:40,628 --> 00:19:43,150
of this Godforsaken country
in one piece.

298
00:20:10,067 --> 00:20:11,628
Quickly.

299
00:20:15,628 --> 00:20:17,627
Not bad for a shoemaker.

300
00:20:18,202 --> 00:20:19,440
Everyone in Berlin

301
00:20:19,441 --> 00:20:22,627
was either on the right
or the wrong side of history.

302
00:20:22,628 --> 00:20:24,001
Voilà.

303
00:20:39,628 --> 00:20:41,627
Why are you here?

304
00:20:42,628 --> 00:20:44,420
We need to finish what we started.

305
00:20:46,628 --> 00:20:48,627
Hey, I'm hiding in a glorified closet.

306
00:20:48,628 --> 00:20:50,233
I have nowhere to go.

307
00:20:50,234 --> 00:20:52,627
I have very few options at my disposal.

308
00:20:52,628 --> 00:20:54,482
You want help?
I suggest you look elsewhere.

309
00:20:54,483 --> 00:20:57,042
What I want is someone
without ties to the CIA,

310
00:20:57,043 --> 00:20:58,627
someone with nothing left to lose.

311
00:20:58,628 --> 00:20:59,743
Well...?

312
00:21:02,628 --> 00:21:04,628
I think Hector is Thomas Shaw.

313
00:21:17,357 --> 00:21:19,627
You realize what you're
accusing your friend of?

314
00:21:20,056 --> 00:21:21,291
Think about it.

315
00:21:23,963 --> 00:21:25,627
What do we know?

316
00:21:26,067 --> 00:21:29,180
Thomas Shaw has a conduit,
Julian De Vos.

317
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:33,090
De Vos was held at a CIA
black site in Morocco for years,

318
00:21:33,115 --> 00:21:34,114
tortured for information,

319
00:21:34,115 --> 00:21:37,270
until someone on the ground
helped him escape.

320
00:21:37,565 --> 00:21:38,888
You think Hector helped him escape?

321
00:21:38,889 --> 00:21:40,738
During the time De Vos was in Morocco,

322
00:21:40,777 --> 00:21:42,776
Hector's file is completely redacted.

323
00:21:43,344 --> 00:21:45,776
I was told he was coming down
from North Africa.

324
00:21:45,777 --> 00:21:47,776
Which gives Hector a convenient
overlap with Julian.

325
00:21:48,281 --> 00:21:49,776
There are dozens of people

326
00:21:49,777 --> 00:21:51,776
that have access
to any given black site.

327
00:21:51,777 --> 00:21:53,776
- It could be coincidence.
- It's not.

328
00:21:54,474 --> 00:21:57,353
I think Hector helped De Vos
escape the black site,

329
00:21:57,354 --> 00:21:59,399
and in return, De Vos
is happy to do his bidding,

330
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,776
whether it's handing off
a flash drive to Claudia Gartner

331
00:22:03,134 --> 00:22:04,265
or killing her.

332
00:22:24,992 --> 00:22:26,687
Hypothetically...

333
00:22:27,482 --> 00:22:30,052
we link them. Okay, fine.

334
00:22:30,777 --> 00:22:32,360
Why would he leak secrets?

335
00:22:32,361 --> 00:22:34,776
Case officers spend a couple
years at a black site,

336
00:22:34,777 --> 00:22:35,923
it changes them.

337
00:22:36,727 --> 00:22:37,726
Some retire.

338
00:22:38,049 --> 00:22:40,249
Others commit suicide.

339
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:44,000
You've known him longer than anyone.

340
00:22:44,461 --> 00:22:45,776
Is he that different

341
00:22:45,777 --> 00:22:47,777
than the man who was in Chechnya?

342
00:22:50,582 --> 00:22:51,566
Yeah.

343
00:22:52,777 --> 00:22:53,777
He is.

344
00:22:58,021 --> 00:23:00,395
Well, there's only one thing left to do.

345
00:23:01,777 --> 00:23:02,868
Prove it.

346
00:23:03,777 --> 00:23:05,892
Have any ideas where to start?

347
00:23:29,672 --> 00:23:33,376
_

348
00:23:34,226 --> 00:23:36,776
I've been meaning
to extend my sympathies.

349
00:23:36,777 --> 00:23:38,776
- Oh, yeah?
- Losing Frost must have been

350
00:23:38,777 --> 00:23:41,777
a terrible blow to the Station.

351
00:23:45,521 --> 00:23:47,521
Thanks for your concern.

352
00:23:49,777 --> 00:23:52,041
But if you're asking me where he is...

353
00:23:52,777 --> 00:23:54,776
the answer is I don't know.

354
00:23:54,777 --> 00:23:56,519
That would have been a nice bonus,

355
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,776
but I already came once today.

356
00:24:02,777 --> 00:24:04,776
- May I ask you a question?
- Mm-hmm.

357
00:24:05,616 --> 00:24:07,089
Why are you sleeping with me?

358
00:24:07,777 --> 00:24:09,117
Isn't it obvious?

359
00:24:09,455 --> 00:24:11,776
There are plenty of other women

360
00:24:11,777 --> 00:24:12,776
you could have sex with,

361
00:24:12,777 --> 00:24:15,047
all far less damning than I could be.

362
00:24:15,524 --> 00:24:17,776
We're not all as calculating
and manipulative

363
00:24:17,777 --> 00:24:18,776
as you are, Ms. Krug.

364
00:24:18,777 --> 00:24:22,045
Mr. Miller, you don't know
anything about me.

365
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:24,415
Well, I do know
that every time I see you,

366
00:24:24,416 --> 00:24:25,795
you're wearing a mask.

367
00:24:26,777 --> 00:24:29,776
A tough, sophisticated facade.

368
00:24:29,777 --> 00:24:31,748
What's behind the mask?

369
00:24:32,777 --> 00:24:34,776
Vulnerability?

370
00:24:35,414 --> 00:24:37,776
A vulnerability I'd like to see.

371
00:24:37,777 --> 00:24:39,339
I wish you luck.

372
00:24:40,014 --> 00:24:41,776
Why are you sleeping with me?

373
00:24:41,777 --> 00:24:43,531
I'm working you, remember?

374
00:24:44,165 --> 00:24:45,631
Well, you <i>were.</i>

375
00:24:46,777 --> 00:24:49,176
But now I think you might
actually like me.

376
00:24:49,777 --> 00:24:53,777
Mr. Miller, I'll lower my mask
when you lower yours.

377
00:25:53,777 --> 00:25:57,070
You know, I would've taken you
for a Turkish bath kind of guy.

378
00:25:57,777 --> 00:25:59,324
Too much steam.

379
00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:02,996
Can't see who's coming at you.

380
00:26:03,683 --> 00:26:05,683
This part of the attraction?

381
00:26:07,777 --> 00:26:10,776
So, are you turning yourself in?

382
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:13,033
Well, I'm not really dressed for it.

383
00:26:13,777 --> 00:26:15,776
No. I have a proposition.

384
00:26:15,777 --> 00:26:17,776
One that involves turning yourself in?

385
00:26:17,777 --> 00:26:20,740
I'm gonna give you somebody
you want more than me.

386
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:22,838
Thomas Shaw.

387
00:26:25,026 --> 00:26:27,776
Shaw isn't a German priority.

388
00:26:27,777 --> 00:26:29,776
Oh, come on. Don't play coy.

389
00:26:29,777 --> 00:26:32,776
If you're right and we took Iosava,

390
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:35,776
then Langley let innocent people die.

391
00:26:36,299 --> 00:26:39,827
And they betrayed
and humiliated both of us.

392
00:26:40,777 --> 00:26:42,527
Hell, I'm gift-wrapping for you

393
00:26:42,528 --> 00:26:44,776
the chance to do
what Americans could not.

394
00:26:45,374 --> 00:26:49,776
And then you dangle Shaw
over their fucking heads

395
00:26:49,777 --> 00:26:52,746
until they beg for forgiveness.

396
00:26:54,134 --> 00:26:55,690
You have him?

397
00:26:58,059 --> 00:26:59,776
We'll know for sure in a few hours.

398
00:26:59,777 --> 00:27:01,225
And if we're right, he's yours.

399
00:27:01,226 --> 00:27:03,306
The Germans take credit for the arrest.

400
00:27:03,777 --> 00:27:05,820
In return,

401
00:27:07,025 --> 00:27:09,777
I walk out of Germany a free man.

402
00:27:13,213 --> 00:27:14,566
Deal?

403
00:27:16,166 --> 00:27:18,776
Let's go back
to your time in North Africa.

404
00:27:18,777 --> 00:27:20,410
You were stationed in Morocco.

405
00:27:20,411 --> 00:27:21,776
That's classified.

406
00:27:21,777 --> 00:27:23,006
I'm read into it.

407
00:27:23,777 --> 00:27:26,776
What does North Africa
have to do with Iosava?

408
00:27:26,777 --> 00:27:28,398
You acted out of turn, Mr. DeJean.

409
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:29,776
I'm to determine if your experiences,

410
00:27:29,777 --> 00:27:34,141
both past and recent, have left
you unfit to stay in the field.

411
00:27:34,777 --> 00:27:36,776
We wouldn't be having this conversation

412
00:27:36,777 --> 00:27:39,203
- if she was still alive.
- If Ruth Iosava was still alive?

413
00:27:39,204 --> 00:27:41,776
If Clare Itani was still alive.

414
00:27:42,049 --> 00:27:43,776
Earlier today, you said
that you performed

415
00:27:43,777 --> 00:27:47,776
enhanced interrogation methods
to find Clare Itani's location.

416
00:27:47,777 --> 00:27:49,776
I'm assuming that you were taught

417
00:27:49,777 --> 00:27:52,174
those methods in Morocco...

418
00:27:52,175 --> 00:27:54,488
Waterboarding, sleep deprivation,

419
00:27:54,489 --> 00:27:56,776
walling, rectal rehydration.

420
00:27:57,275 --> 00:28:00,777
Did you ever participate
in those interrogation methods?

421
00:28:02,777 --> 00:28:06,777
Now, <i>that,</i> lady, I know
you're not read into.

422
00:28:23,633 --> 00:28:26,016
Honey, ain't it a little early?

423
00:28:27,777 --> 00:28:29,777
Don't lecture me.

424
00:28:31,777 --> 00:28:33,776
The fuck is your problem?

425
00:28:33,777 --> 00:28:35,228
Currently, you are.

426
00:28:35,229 --> 00:28:37,776
Don't make me take things
into my own hands.

427
00:28:37,777 --> 00:28:39,776
I don't need a fucking babysitter.

428
00:28:39,777 --> 00:28:41,604
Oh, yes, you do.

429
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:45,471
- I'll be here waiting.
- Waiting for what?

430
00:28:47,086 --> 00:28:49,359
To pick up the pieces.

431
00:28:51,777 --> 00:28:54,776
So, Mr. Chief of Station...

432
00:28:54,777 --> 00:28:56,242
Will you stop calling me that, please?

433
00:28:56,243 --> 00:28:58,119
It's acting Chief.
It's just an interim title

434
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,363
until Headquarters finds a replacement.

435
00:29:00,777 --> 00:29:02,776
Or until the position becomes permanent.

436
00:29:02,777 --> 00:29:05,291
I don't want the position.
I already told you that.

437
00:29:05,612 --> 00:29:07,776
It's a career-defining opportunity.

438
00:29:07,777 --> 00:29:09,776
Tell Tel Aviv I want out of Berlin.

439
00:29:09,777 --> 00:29:12,777
Nothing you or they say
will make me change my mind.

440
00:29:20,715 --> 00:29:21,714
How's Steven?

441
00:29:22,551 --> 00:29:25,294
You know he's taking the fall
for Iosava's rendition.

442
00:29:26,069 --> 00:29:27,776
There's a warrant out for his arrest.

443
00:29:27,777 --> 00:29:29,205
Everything's a total clusterfuck.

444
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:30,777
How do you think he is?

445
00:29:33,371 --> 00:29:34,245
Why?

446
00:29:35,777 --> 00:29:37,621
Do you know something?

447
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,776
Does Mossad know where he is?

448
00:29:41,132 --> 00:29:42,702
We do not.

449
00:29:44,108 --> 00:29:45,776
He should've come to me, you know?

450
00:29:45,777 --> 00:29:47,094
He should've come to me directly.

451
00:29:47,095 --> 00:29:49,235
I'd have had him
on a military flight out of here

452
00:29:49,236 --> 00:29:50,776
in fucking 20 minutes.

453
00:29:50,777 --> 00:29:52,578
So fucking stupid.

454
00:29:52,579 --> 00:29:54,776
Tel Aviv is more concerned
with Antoinette

455
00:29:54,777 --> 00:29:56,776
than they are with Frost.

456
00:29:57,028 --> 00:29:58,908
Were you able to get the file?

457
00:30:00,777 --> 00:30:02,979
You know, I actually tried.

458
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:05,776
I went through every file
in the goddamn file room.

459
00:30:05,777 --> 00:30:07,776
I risked my neck for you for nothing.

460
00:30:07,777 --> 00:30:10,776
And if I didn't already
make myself abundantly clear,

461
00:30:10,777 --> 00:30:12,776
it was a bullshit ask
by Tel Aviv in the first place,

462
00:30:12,777 --> 00:30:15,777
especially while one of my
officer's lives was at stake.

463
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:20,527
What is this Antoinette anyway?

464
00:30:21,777 --> 00:30:23,672
Why is it so important to you?

465
00:30:25,377 --> 00:30:27,776
Find it, and you will see for yourself.

466
00:30:28,079 --> 00:30:29,776
I'm out of here.

467
00:30:29,777 --> 00:30:32,023
I got to go.

468
00:30:38,687 --> 00:30:41,776
If Mossad should get wind
of Steven's whereabouts,

469
00:30:41,777 --> 00:30:46,776
even if it's just a hunch,
you contact me, please.

470
00:30:46,777 --> 00:30:50,777
He may not be your priority,
but he sure as hell is mine.

471
00:30:56,777 --> 00:30:58,437
I need to find him.

472
00:31:02,092 --> 00:31:03,669
_

473
00:31:06,067 --> 00:31:07,347
_

474
00:31:43,777 --> 00:31:45,776
Hector!

475
00:31:45,777 --> 00:31:47,679
- Hey!
- Hey!

476
00:31:48,777 --> 00:31:50,238
What's going on?

477
00:31:51,777 --> 00:31:53,776
W-Whatcha doing here?

478
00:31:54,134 --> 00:31:55,776
I was worried about you.

479
00:31:55,777 --> 00:31:58,242
Just headed down to Barbara
Ellis to see if you were there.

480
00:31:59,549 --> 00:32:01,000
- Are you okay?
- I'm fucked.

481
00:32:01,001 --> 00:32:02,776
I see that.
You reek of whiskey, man.

482
00:32:02,777 --> 00:32:04,776
Look, I hate you got dragged into this.

483
00:32:04,777 --> 00:32:08,953
I'm, uh... I'm sorry
I brought you along.

484
00:32:09,777 --> 00:32:12,776
- Don't worry about it.
- Well, I am fucking worried.

485
00:32:12,777 --> 00:32:14,776
I'm sorry, Daniel. I'm sorry

486
00:32:14,777 --> 00:32:16,776
you had to lie for m... Hey!

487
00:32:16,777 --> 00:32:18,777
Hey!

488
00:32:26,777 --> 00:32:29,343
You've got to be fucking kidding me.

489
00:32:29,344 --> 00:32:30,776
I'm here on behalf of the Agency

490
00:32:30,777 --> 00:32:32,776
to conduct a polygraph examination.

491
00:32:32,777 --> 00:32:34,776
Well, you could have called.
Maybe knocked on our door.

492
00:32:34,777 --> 00:32:36,196
Mr. Miller, you're going to be
escorted down the hall

493
00:32:36,197 --> 00:32:38,368
to the other interrogation room.

494
00:32:38,369 --> 00:32:41,776
And, Mr. DeJean, if you could
please have a seat right here.

495
00:32:41,777 --> 00:32:43,776
And if we don't comply?

496
00:32:43,777 --> 00:32:45,211
You'll be on the next flight home.

497
00:32:45,212 --> 00:32:47,224
We're already on
the next flight home, lady.

498
00:32:47,225 --> 00:32:49,062
You can thank the Agency for giving you

499
00:32:49,063 --> 00:32:51,233
this opportunity to explain yourselves.

500
00:32:51,777 --> 00:32:53,776
God bless fucking America.

501
00:32:53,777 --> 00:32:55,506
Sit.

502
00:33:03,294 --> 00:33:06,399
- Okay, that's it.
- Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.

503
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:09,776
Where'd you find her?

504
00:33:09,777 --> 00:33:12,776
Oh, she's an old colleague
of mine, since retired.

505
00:33:12,777 --> 00:33:13,776
Owed me a favor.

506
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,289
You trust her?

507
00:33:15,777 --> 00:33:16,729
Yes.

508
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:18,609
Think he bought it?

509
00:33:18,634 --> 00:33:20,440
I don't know.

510
00:33:21,777 --> 00:33:23,201
How'd it go with Hans?

511
00:33:23,777 --> 00:33:24,776
Oh, he's interested.

512
00:33:24,777 --> 00:33:26,776
Agreed to take the bounty off my head

513
00:33:26,777 --> 00:33:28,776
as soon as we hand over Thomas Shaw.

514
00:33:28,777 --> 00:33:31,065
Okay. You're sure about this?

515
00:33:31,777 --> 00:33:34,065
Yeah. I trust Hans
will do the right thing.

516
00:33:34,777 --> 00:33:36,459
You sure about <i>this?</i>

517
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:39,776
Well, I considered the idea
of protecting him, but...

518
00:33:39,777 --> 00:33:41,776
I couldn't live with myself.

519
00:33:41,777 --> 00:33:43,777
Let's just get this over with.

520
00:33:46,342 --> 00:33:48,266
<i>State your name for the record.</i>

521
00:33:48,777 --> 00:33:50,776
<i>Hector Owen DeJean.</i>

522
00:33:51,244 --> 00:33:52,776
<i>Do you know why you've been called in</i>

523
00:33:52,777 --> 00:33:55,155
<i>- for questioning, Mr. DeJean?
- "Called in?"</i>

524
00:33:55,494 --> 00:33:56,493
That's liberal.

525
00:33:57,147 --> 00:33:58,776
Answer the question.

526
00:33:59,125 --> 00:34:02,081
Op goes bad. Agency's first response

527
00:34:02,082 --> 00:34:04,438
is always to cover its ass.

528
00:34:06,777 --> 00:34:07,867
Hey.

529
00:34:09,115 --> 00:34:10,759
Is now a bad time?

530
00:34:12,243 --> 00:34:14,509
No, not at all. Come on in.

531
00:34:15,777 --> 00:34:19,403
What's going on?

532
00:34:20,549 --> 00:34:23,548
I know you already have enough
on your plate, and...

533
00:34:24,284 --> 00:34:25,776
I haven't been able to sleep,

534
00:34:25,777 --> 00:34:27,776
with everything that's been going on.

535
00:34:27,777 --> 00:34:29,783
Long story short,

536
00:34:30,716 --> 00:34:32,715
I came in early
to organize the file room.

537
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:34,839
And it turns out there's one missing...

538
00:34:35,777 --> 00:34:37,406
Operation Antoinette.

539
00:34:39,777 --> 00:34:42,776
With Langley poking their noses
in our affairs,

540
00:34:42,777 --> 00:34:45,776
I know it could've
easily been misplaced.

541
00:34:45,903 --> 00:34:48,090
I just wanted you to be aware.

542
00:34:54,588 --> 00:34:56,776
Did you come into contact
with a man named Julian De Vos

543
00:34:56,777 --> 00:34:59,005
when you were stationed in North Africa?

544
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:00,659
No.

545
00:35:00,777 --> 00:35:01,860
Look again.

546
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:03,949
No.

547
00:35:05,621 --> 00:35:07,621
Does this jog your memory?

548
00:35:11,583 --> 00:35:13,583
<i>If you'll excuse me for a moment.</i>

549
00:35:19,114 --> 00:35:20,582
It's not working.

550
00:35:20,583 --> 00:35:23,582
Textbook avoidance techniques...
Slowing down his heart rate,

551
00:35:23,583 --> 00:35:26,144
lying during insignificant moments

552
00:35:26,145 --> 00:35:28,214
to make his results more consistent.

553
00:35:28,215 --> 00:35:29,883
We're all trained to beat the poly.

554
00:35:29,884 --> 00:35:31,582
We all slip up eventually.

555
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:35,582
We could force it. Scopolamine.

556
00:35:35,583 --> 00:35:38,021
He has a tolerance to most substances.

557
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:40,190
This drug drug weakens
the central nervous system,

558
00:35:40,191 --> 00:35:41,582
making it harder to lie.

559
00:35:41,583 --> 00:35:43,247
Even if it works,

560
00:35:43,248 --> 00:35:46,583
it's not the most ethical
or safest of options.

561
00:35:48,583 --> 00:35:50,582
- Do it.
- Take a second

562
00:35:50,583 --> 00:35:52,582
to consider the ramifications
if you're wrong.

563
00:35:52,583 --> 00:35:53,810
I'm not wrong.

564
00:35:54,583 --> 00:35:55,745
Do it.

565
00:35:56,583 --> 00:35:58,185
When am I coming home?

566
00:35:58,483 --> 00:36:00,558
Well, tentatively next month,

567
00:36:00,583 --> 00:36:02,582
but I, uh... You know,
I booked a refundable ticket

568
00:36:02,583 --> 00:36:04,076
in case I have to switch
the dates around.

569
00:36:04,077 --> 00:36:06,405
<i>So you're not coming?</i>

570
00:36:06,406 --> 00:36:08,582
No. No. I didn't say that.

571
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:11,582
I <i>am</i> coming home. I just...

572
00:36:11,583 --> 00:36:13,119
I have a thing at work.

573
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:15,242
It's taking longer than I anticipated.

574
00:36:15,243 --> 00:36:17,129
That... That... That's it. No big deal.

575
00:36:17,154 --> 00:36:20,180
<i>- There's always something at work.</i>
- Hey, listen, buddy.

576
00:36:20,181 --> 00:36:21,582
If I could get on a plane
and comes home tonight,

577
00:36:21,583 --> 00:36:23,323
- believe me, I would.
- <i>Yeah. Whatever.</i>

578
00:36:23,324 --> 00:36:24,851
Don't... Don't do that.

579
00:36:24,852 --> 00:36:28,034
Don't "Hey, whatever" me.
I'm doing the best I can here.

580
00:36:28,583 --> 00:36:30,376
Look, I'm coming home, Noah,

581
00:36:30,377 --> 00:36:33,038
either next month
or the month after that, okay?

582
00:36:33,039 --> 00:36:34,795
- For sure.
- <i>You're full of shit.</i>

583
00:36:34,796 --> 00:36:36,750
Hey, language!

584
00:36:37,583 --> 00:36:38,758
Fuck.

585
00:36:39,521 --> 00:36:40,624
Noah?

586
00:36:41,931 --> 00:36:43,915
Noah, come back please.

587
00:36:44,583 --> 00:36:46,704
Noah, come back here.

588
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:52,847
You Agency suits are relentless.

589
00:36:53,583 --> 00:36:55,952
- Do I have your permission?
- Oh, fuck you, lady.

590
00:36:55,977 --> 00:36:59,583
You're gonna stick that thing
in my arm no matter what I say.

591
00:37:34,583 --> 00:37:36,604
<i>Let's try this again.</i>

592
00:37:37,583 --> 00:37:39,077
<i>Mr. DeJean.</i>

593
00:37:39,583 --> 00:37:42,243
Mr. DeJean, I need you
to focus on my face.

594
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:44,582
How do you feel, Mr. DeJean?

595
00:37:44,583 --> 00:37:46,742
I feel fucking great.

596
00:37:48,127 --> 00:37:51,092
You got more of this stuff? Huh?

597
00:37:51,583 --> 00:37:54,583
I haven't felt this fucking high
in a long time.

598
00:37:58,072 --> 00:38:00,583
- Too long.
- Do you know why you're here?

599
00:38:05,837 --> 00:38:07,582
Mm.

600
00:38:07,583 --> 00:38:09,583
Why are you here?

601
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:15,583
I'm sorry.

602
00:38:17,903 --> 00:38:19,769
Because of Clare.

603
00:38:32,422 --> 00:38:33,920
Hey, babe.

604
00:38:33,921 --> 00:38:35,582
Hey. Mm.

605
00:38:35,583 --> 00:38:36,582
Surprise, surprise.

606
00:38:36,583 --> 00:38:39,468
- Is now an okay time?
- Sure.

607
00:38:40,835 --> 00:38:43,583
Can I get a neat Vodka martini
for the lady?

608
00:38:58,194 --> 00:38:59,294
What's up?

609
00:39:03,983 --> 00:39:05,857
What if I told you

610
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:09,069
that our meeting wasn't fate?

611
00:39:11,133 --> 00:39:14,718
That night that I walked
into your bar in Battersea,

612
00:39:15,583 --> 00:39:17,252
it wasn't by chance.

613
00:39:18,583 --> 00:39:20,582
I was on assignment.

614
00:39:20,583 --> 00:39:22,582
I was working a potential terror plot.

615
00:39:22,583 --> 00:39:24,829
What?

616
00:39:25,412 --> 00:39:28,582
That Algerian investor
in your pub, Ahmed?

617
00:39:28,583 --> 00:39:29,582
He was a suspect.

618
00:39:29,939 --> 00:39:32,268
Ahmed? The optometrist?

619
00:39:33,583 --> 00:39:34,959
Hold... Wait, wait, wait a sec.

620
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,583
Just back up a minute.

621
00:39:40,764 --> 00:39:42,582
I was a way in?

622
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:46,227
Val, this whole thing was a-a front,

623
00:39:46,583 --> 00:39:47,582
a way to gain access?

624
00:39:47,583 --> 00:39:49,582
Yes, at first.

625
00:39:49,932 --> 00:39:51,582
But then I fell in love with you.

626
00:39:51,583 --> 00:39:54,582
Before or after
you first <i>said</i> you loved me?

627
00:39:54,583 --> 00:39:56,582
That's not fair, Benjamin.

628
00:39:56,583 --> 00:39:59,582
- This is really hard on me, too.
- Really?

629
00:39:59,583 --> 00:40:02,583
Seems you've managed it pretty
fine these past five years.

630
00:40:10,583 --> 00:40:12,582
I closed the books after six months,

631
00:40:12,583 --> 00:40:15,132
and I wrote a report saying
the Algerian was clean,

632
00:40:15,157 --> 00:40:16,582
because I just wanted it to be over.

633
00:40:16,583 --> 00:40:19,034
I just wanted to be with you,
without lying to you.

634
00:40:19,035 --> 00:40:21,582
What, and then we just
live happily ever after?

635
00:40:21,583 --> 00:40:23,538
Would you please let me finish?

636
00:40:24,583 --> 00:40:27,075
I closed those books too soon.

637
00:40:27,583 --> 00:40:29,746
He <i>was</i> funneling money
to the Kouachi brothers.

638
00:40:30,336 --> 00:40:32,582
They went in, and they shot up
<i>Charlie Hebdo.</i>

639
00:40:32,583 --> 00:40:33,582
And 12 people were killed

640
00:40:33,583 --> 00:40:35,899
- because I...
- All right. No, I asked you

641
00:40:36,883 --> 00:40:39,020
if you were hiding anything, remember?

642
00:40:39,583 --> 00:40:41,351
After Shaw hit Berlin.

643
00:40:42,583 --> 00:40:43,689
I know.

644
00:40:44,583 --> 00:40:46,004
But I'm not now.

645
00:40:47,172 --> 00:40:49,583
- I promise you...
- I need to clear my head.

646
00:40:53,583 --> 00:40:55,823
I think it'd be better

647
00:40:55,848 --> 00:40:58,583
if you found someplace else
to sleep tonight.

648
00:41:05,583 --> 00:41:06,906
I'm on my way now.

649
00:41:07,349 --> 00:41:08,348
15 minutes.

650
00:41:08,583 --> 00:41:09,583
Okay.

651
00:41:16,822 --> 00:41:18,416
_

652
00:41:19,144 --> 00:41:20,433
_

653
00:41:21,158 --> 00:41:22,406
_

654
00:41:35,583 --> 00:41:38,487
- Esther Krug.
- Sandra Abe.

655
00:41:39,583 --> 00:41:42,073
Everything passes by you, doesn't it?

656
00:41:43,096 --> 00:41:44,770
If it's Steven that you want,

657
00:41:45,166 --> 00:41:46,582
you're wasting your time.

658
00:41:46,583 --> 00:41:47,977
You're on German soil,

659
00:41:47,978 --> 00:41:51,169
and you're harboring
a fugitive from justice.

660
00:41:51,583 --> 00:41:54,284
Steven Frost has nothing to do

661
00:41:54,285 --> 00:41:56,582
with the rendition of Aleksandre Iosava.

662
00:41:56,583 --> 00:41:58,582
He hired Zoltan Vasile.

663
00:41:59,234 --> 00:42:01,107
And I have no idea who that is.

664
00:42:01,902 --> 00:42:04,545
And certainly don't know
where Steven is.

665
00:42:05,649 --> 00:42:08,582
So, Ms. Krug,

666
00:42:08,583 --> 00:42:10,769
if you don't mind, I have a date.

667
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:13,582
And I have diplomatic status.

668
00:42:13,583 --> 00:42:15,583
You know what that means.

669
00:42:26,583 --> 00:42:28,582
When you arrived
at the warehouse in Wedding,

670
00:42:28,583 --> 00:42:31,032
was Clare Itani still alive?

671
00:42:34,583 --> 00:42:37,024
Mr. DeJean, answer the question.

672
00:42:42,922 --> 00:42:44,220
Yes.

673
00:42:44,583 --> 00:42:46,219
<i>Did you see her die?</i>

674
00:42:48,879 --> 00:42:50,102
<i>Yes.</i>

675
00:42:50,909 --> 00:42:53,582
Did you come into contact
with Ruth Iosava

676
00:42:53,583 --> 00:42:55,733
after Clare Itani's death?

677
00:42:56,583 --> 00:42:57,582
Yes.

678
00:42:58,165 --> 00:43:00,247
Is Ruth Iosava still alive?

679
00:43:01,901 --> 00:43:03,323
No.

680
00:43:04,583 --> 00:43:06,302
<i>Was she murdered?</i>

681
00:43:08,583 --> 00:43:10,583
- Yes.
- Did you kill her?

682
00:43:13,583 --> 00:43:14,582
Yes.

683
00:43:14,956 --> 00:43:16,219
How?

684
00:43:20,919 --> 00:43:22,583
I broke her neck.

685
00:43:42,141 --> 00:43:43,739
That a threat?

686
00:43:44,583 --> 00:43:46,583
No. On the contrary.

687
00:43:49,583 --> 00:43:52,046
Because it's completely ethical

688
00:43:52,047 --> 00:43:54,582
for you to dig up any of your
co-workers' dirty laundry

689
00:43:54,583 --> 00:43:59,056
the moment you get
any semblance of power.

690
00:44:02,458 --> 00:44:05,582
You have no idea how that file
came into my possession.

691
00:44:05,583 --> 00:44:07,170
You went looking for it,

692
00:44:07,583 --> 00:44:09,582
'cause you want to keep me in line,

693
00:44:10,051 --> 00:44:12,170
make sure I keep doing your bidding.

694
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:14,582
But you are shit out of luck, pal.

695
00:44:14,830 --> 00:44:16,582
You want to believe I'm a bad guy?

696
00:44:17,123 --> 00:44:19,582
Your fucking enemy? That's fine.

697
00:44:20,354 --> 00:44:21,582
No, you know what? It's not fine,

698
00:44:21,583 --> 00:44:23,992
'cause it's not the truth.
It's not reality.

699
00:44:24,583 --> 00:44:26,976
The reality of what's happening
right here

700
00:44:26,977 --> 00:44:28,374
between you and me with that

701
00:44:28,375 --> 00:44:30,783
is that I'm doing you a fucking solid.

702
00:44:31,976 --> 00:44:33,582
This station is a disaster.

703
00:44:33,583 --> 00:44:36,282
I'm doing everything I can
to hold it together.

704
00:44:36,283 --> 00:44:38,215
I'm doing everything in my power

705
00:44:38,216 --> 00:44:40,306
to make sure that there are
no more casualties.

706
00:44:40,331 --> 00:44:43,582
One more fuck-up, Langley's
in here cleaning house.

707
00:44:43,583 --> 00:44:47,582
So, going forward,
this can go one of two ways.

708
00:44:48,270 --> 00:44:52,083
One, you get over yourself,
and you help me.

709
00:44:52,084 --> 00:44:54,015
Or two, you don't.

710
00:44:54,583 --> 00:44:58,582
Either way, I'm gonna do my job.

711
00:44:58,583 --> 00:45:01,202
I'm going to continue to do
what's in the best interest

712
00:45:01,203 --> 00:45:04,969
of this Station,
of the entire God-damned Agency,

713
00:45:04,970 --> 00:45:08,000
and, yeah, believe it or not,
Valerie, even of you.

714
00:45:09,583 --> 00:45:12,281
- Are you done?
- Yeah, I'm done.

715
00:45:13,152 --> 00:45:16,582
Good. Now, if you would kindly
get the fuck out of my office,

716
00:45:16,583 --> 00:45:18,583
I would appreciate it.

717
00:45:41,350 --> 00:45:43,737
_

718
00:45:50,328 --> 00:45:52,931
_

719
00:46:07,346 --> 00:46:09,346
_

720
00:46:16,583 --> 00:46:19,148
Do you know who this is?

721
00:46:19,149 --> 00:46:21,583
Mr. DeJean, do you know who this is?

722
00:46:24,155 --> 00:46:25,582
There's two of you.

723
00:46:26,019 --> 00:46:27,582
And two of me.

724
00:46:27,890 --> 00:46:29,979
And there's two of her...

725
00:46:31,178 --> 00:46:33,582
- and two of him.
- To clarify, you're saying

726
00:46:33,583 --> 00:46:35,822
that you know both Julian De Vos
and Shirley Pimple?

727
00:46:35,823 --> 00:46:39,299
You can never know anyone.

728
00:46:39,938 --> 00:46:41,292
That's the fucking truth.

729
00:46:41,293 --> 00:46:43,582
Because the person
you present to the world,

730
00:46:43,583 --> 00:46:45,972
the person everyone sees...

731
00:46:47,583 --> 00:46:49,582
that guy is always bullshit.

732
00:46:49,583 --> 00:46:51,433
Are there two sides of you?

733
00:46:52,583 --> 00:46:54,582
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

734
00:46:54,583 --> 00:46:56,582
Which one I am speaking to?

735
00:46:56,583 --> 00:47:00,583
Oh, the one fit for public consumption.

736
00:47:10,583 --> 00:47:11,583
Patricia?

737
00:47:24,507 --> 00:47:28,845
_

738
00:47:28,845 --> 00:47:32,349
_

739
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:35,162
_

740
00:47:36,442 --> 00:47:38,442
_

741
00:47:39,583 --> 00:47:42,582
Let's go back
to your time in Morocco.

742
00:47:42,583 --> 00:47:43,996
Morocco.

743
00:47:45,002 --> 00:47:46,583
What happened there?

744
00:47:50,972 --> 00:47:53,547
<i>I went down the rabbit hole...</i>

745
00:47:54,583 --> 00:47:56,582
<i>into the darkness.</i>

746
00:47:56,583 --> 00:47:58,872
<i>Describe the darkness.</i>

747
00:47:59,583 --> 00:48:02,358
Of course, the irony is
it isn't dark at all.

748
00:48:02,359 --> 00:48:04,582
It's the exact fucking opposite.

749
00:48:05,183 --> 00:48:09,075
It's hot and muggy,
and it reeks of vomit and sweat

750
00:48:09,076 --> 00:48:11,865
and piss and shit.

751
00:48:12,583 --> 00:48:13,953
<i>Fear.</i>

752
00:48:15,944 --> 00:48:18,189
<i>And it's bright.</i>

753
00:48:18,190 --> 00:48:20,582
<i>It's blindingly bright.</i>

754
00:48:20,583 --> 00:48:22,582
You see, it needs to be.

755
00:48:22,583 --> 00:48:25,582
You need to be able
to see what you're doing

756
00:48:25,583 --> 00:48:28,675
when you're killing people slowly.

757
00:48:29,583 --> 00:48:32,050
<i>What did you do to Julian De Vos?</i>

758
00:48:33,583 --> 00:48:35,411
Julian was the rabbit.

759
00:48:36,583 --> 00:48:38,582
Did you bring him out of the darkness?

760
00:48:38,583 --> 00:48:41,404
- Did you help him escape?
- No.

761
00:48:42,583 --> 00:48:44,582
No, he helped me.

762
00:48:44,583 --> 00:48:46,582
Are you angry at the CIA

763
00:48:46,583 --> 00:48:49,583
for forcing you
to interrogate Julian De Vos?

764
00:48:51,948 --> 00:48:53,252
No.

765
00:48:55,583 --> 00:48:58,582
No, they can't do anything
to me anymore.

766
00:48:58,583 --> 00:49:00,302
<i>Do you think that the Agency</i>

767
00:49:00,303 --> 00:49:02,272
<i>deserves to face the consequences?</i>

768
00:49:02,273 --> 00:49:04,583
<i>What consequences?</i>

769
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:10,049
No one knows what they've done.

770
00:49:11,583 --> 00:49:13,089
Thomas Shaw knows.

771
00:49:15,018 --> 00:49:17,582
Did Thomas Shaw know
that Colander was an agent?

772
00:49:17,583 --> 00:49:18,744
Yes.

773
00:49:19,945 --> 00:49:24,015
Did <i>you</i> know that Houjin Lin
was being housed in Berlin?

774
00:49:24,016 --> 00:49:25,225
Yes.

775
00:49:27,882 --> 00:49:29,409
<i>Mr. DeJean,</i>

776
00:49:31,130 --> 00:49:33,211
are you Thomas Shaw?

777
00:49:35,482 --> 00:49:36,482
No.

778
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:41,583
Thomas Shaw is dead.
