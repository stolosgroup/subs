<i>Previously on</i> "Berlin Station"...

2
00:00:09,081 --> 00:00:10,130
You're Thomas Shaw.

3
00:00:10,233 --> 00:00:13,168
I know about De Vos, the black site,

4
00:00:13,248 --> 00:00:16,605
the murder of Claudia Gartner,
Ingrid Hollander, all of it.

5
00:00:16,693 --> 00:00:18,560
You can take your mind games
to the Germans.

6
00:00:18,606 --> 00:00:20,069
You don't wanna do that, Sherlock.

7
00:00:20,149 --> 00:00:22,317
The Germans got to me before you did.

8
00:00:22,422 --> 00:00:24,978
You're free to go back
to whatever agenda you choose

9
00:00:25,004 --> 00:00:26,862
after Berlin Station
is sufficiently crippled.

10
00:00:26,888 --> 00:00:29,133
I'll turn myself in
before I give you Shaw.

11
00:00:29,205 --> 00:00:30,809
And what about Julian De Vos?

12
00:00:30,876 --> 00:00:32,431
I'm sure the boys in maximum security

13
00:00:32,455 --> 00:00:34,663
would love to dress him up
as Shirley Pimple.

14
00:00:34,717 --> 00:00:36,404
- I told you.
- Yeah.

15
00:00:36,467 --> 00:00:38,706
I've been thinking of ways
of changing the system.

16
00:00:38,804 --> 00:00:41,159
It would involve me taking on
a new identity.

17
00:00:41,185 --> 00:00:41,973
Why are you doing this?

18
00:00:41,999 --> 00:00:45,151
Just... just get
on that fucking boat and go.

19
00:00:45,381 --> 00:00:47,797
Frank Dupont, former Special Activities.

20
00:00:47,877 --> 00:00:49,846
You were contracted to kill
Julian De Vos?

21
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:51,118
I shot him, sure.

22
00:00:51,197 --> 00:00:52,817
Unless you got eyes on a body yourself,

23
00:00:52,864 --> 00:00:54,152
never count 'em for dead.

24
00:00:54,215 --> 00:00:55,289
Clay Williams is here.

25
00:00:55,392 --> 00:00:57,274
Just when you thought things
shouldn't get any worse.

26
00:00:57,353 --> 00:00:59,142
I need to close out theIosava case.

27
00:00:59,238 --> 00:01:01,001
The Germans think that I tookIosava.

28
00:01:01,072 --> 00:01:02,646
So what exactly are you doing here?

29
00:01:02,701 --> 00:01:04,607
Hans didn't mention he arrested
Zoltan Vasile,

30
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,365
- the thug that tookIosava?
- No.

31
00:01:08,256 --> 00:01:10,313
- Give this to Sandra.
- Steven!

32
00:01:12,045 --> 00:01:13,942
You'll be happy to know that I've dug up

33
00:01:13,968 --> 00:01:16,135
something deeper than dirt
on Ms. Edwards.

34
00:01:16,206 --> 00:01:18,693
An unscheduled meeting
with Golda Friedman.

35
00:01:18,772 --> 00:01:20,504
Are you a double agent for Mossad?

36
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:22,785
I don't work for Golda.
They work for me.

37
00:01:22,823 --> 00:01:24,184
Then prove it.

38
00:01:24,287 --> 00:01:26,322
Uhh! Aah!

39
00:01:26,393 --> 00:01:27,306
Come on.

40
00:01:27,331 --> 00:01:28,475
There weren't better
ways to make amends

41
00:01:28,501 --> 00:01:29,386
than Thomas Shaw?

42
00:01:29,412 --> 00:01:30,699
Not from my vantage point.

43
00:01:30,725 --> 00:01:31,437
Danny?

44
00:01:31,477 --> 00:01:33,164
You touch my cousin,
and I will kill you.

45
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,204
- Julian, just tell me where you are.
- Teufelsberg.

46
00:01:38,242 --> 00:01:40,570
I accept the fact that I choose to work

47
00:01:40,596 --> 00:01:43,077
for an imperfect institution,
like a big boy.

48
00:01:43,132 --> 00:01:46,024
You want sprinkles
on that vanilla cone, big boy?

49
00:01:46,103 --> 00:01:48,885
You should have just
come with me when you let me go.

50
00:01:48,941 --> 00:01:51,053
No.

51
00:01:51,243 --> 00:01:53,340
Go on, as far and as fast as you can.

52
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,161
There's a picture on my desk.

53
00:01:55,208 --> 00:01:56,885
Maybe you should look at it, Daniel.

54
00:01:56,955 --> 00:01:58,473
You run, too.

55
00:01:58,506 --> 00:02:00,214
They'll be here soon enough.

My name is Thomas Shaw,
and this is my final message.

72
00:03:00,735 --> 00:03:02,344
From the start, I have tried to make

73
00:03:02,345 --> 00:03:06,123
the Central Intelligence Agency
accountable for its actions.

74
00:03:08,045 --> 00:03:11,379
I have not always succeeded,
but I have tried.

Why did you let him go?

77
00:03:22,933 --> 00:03:26,255
Hector's not free. He never will be.

78
00:03:26,612 --> 00:03:28,227
It all makes sense now,

79
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:32,817
the way you never tell me anything...

80
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:37,457
your sudden vanishing acts.

81
00:03:43,883 --> 00:03:45,635
You became your father.

82
00:03:47,193 --> 00:03:49,947
Cold, absent.

83
00:03:53,431 --> 00:03:55,920
Was he that way because of his job,

84
00:03:56,087 --> 00:03:59,772
or did he choose to become a spy
because it was perfect for him?

85
00:04:03,613 --> 00:04:05,179
What about you?

86
00:04:07,502 --> 00:04:09,774
It's the only thing
I was ever any good at.

I have a civilian with me.

Did I wake you?

92
00:04:58,908 --> 00:05:01,430
I never sleep, Robert. You know that.

93
00:05:01,498 --> 00:05:03,907
I need your file on AleksandreIosava.

94
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,320
Iosava? Still?

95
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,146
What is it with that little man?

96
00:05:08,218 --> 00:05:10,085
Clay Williams has been busy boxing up

97
00:05:10,111 --> 00:05:11,430
all theIosava intercepts,

98
00:05:11,431 --> 00:05:15,512
and the digital versions have
mysteriously been erased.

99
00:05:15,646 --> 00:05:17,831
Nothing Clay Williams
has done is kosher.

100
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:19,070
I suspect a cover-up.

101
00:05:19,134 --> 00:05:20,604
What are they covering up?

102
00:05:20,723 --> 00:05:24,474
I won't know until I can compare
our intercepts with your file.

103
00:05:24,617 --> 00:05:28,827
- Then let's trade.
- No, there's no time.

104
00:05:29,431 --> 00:05:31,430
If my suspicions are right,

105
00:05:31,989 --> 00:05:34,396
then I can get leverage
over Clay and salvage my career.

106

With all these Berlin fuck-ups
in my corridor file,

107
00:05:37,645 --> 00:05:39,369
I'll... I'll top out at GS-15,

108
00:05:39,448 --> 00:05:42,102
I'll never get my SES.
You wanna try selling

109

110
00:05:44,621 --> 00:05:47,299
Bring me your intercepts, and we
compare them to our files.

111
00:05:47,386 --> 00:05:49,405
No, no, no, no.
Berlin was the sole recipient.

112
00:05:49,459 --> 00:05:51,866
Only the Station's hard copies exist,

113
00:05:51,937 --> 00:05:54,205
and they're being watched over
by a Headquarters stiff.

114
00:05:54,247 --> 00:05:57,143
I need to take your file to the Station.

115
00:06:01,381 --> 00:06:04,206
Okay, um, how about this?

118
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,017
Get me the Chief of Station Overview.

119
00:06:12,137 --> 00:06:13,710
I can't do that.

120
00:06:15,134 --> 00:06:17,212
I give you everything, Robert...

121
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:20,945
the Iranian Behruz,Iosava surveillance,

122
00:06:21,024 --> 00:06:23,551
a path to promotion. I support you.

123
00:06:24,665 --> 00:06:26,429
It's time for you

124
00:06:26,499 --> 00:06:28,352
to start supporting us.

00:06:28,995 --> 00:06:31,648
Tomorrow afternoon, location Hosea.

126
00:06:31,696 --> 00:06:35,970
You bring the Overview,
I will bring theIosava files.

127
00:06:42,919 --> 00:06:45,216
Unbelievable.

128
00:06:47,357 --> 00:06:49,268
I accuse you of selling out to Mossad,

129
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:51,653
and this is how you answer
my accusations?

130
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,132
There is no answer, Valerie,

131
00:06:53,213 --> 00:06:54,672
and you know it.

132
00:06:54,767 --> 00:06:57,340
The only thing I can do is my job.

133
00:06:58,431 --> 00:07:00,870
I'm using my liaison contact

134
00:07:00,925 --> 00:07:04,135
to compare our transcripts to Mossad's.

135
00:07:07,632 --> 00:07:10,430
She wants the Chief of Station Overview.

136
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:15,431
You are not giving Mossad
the true names of our agents.

137
00:07:17,912 --> 00:07:19,430
Okay.

138
00:07:19,629 --> 00:07:20,789
All right.

139
00:07:20,908 --> 00:07:22,482
Well, let's just pack up and go home.

140
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:24,540
Call it a day, why don't we?

141
00:07:26,191 --> 00:07:29,036
Getting clarity onIosava
is the only way to figure out

142
00:07:29,089 --> 00:07:31,171
what Clay Williams is up to.

143
00:07:35,025 --> 00:07:38,721
It may shed light
on what happened to Clare.

144
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:43,113
Hell, if we're lucky, we might
even save Steven in the process.

145
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:45,588
Am... am I missing something?

146
00:07:46,023 --> 00:07:49,071
Yeah, life in prison for treason.

147
00:07:54,746 --> 00:07:57,110
There's one way we're gonna handle this,

148
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,003
and you're gonna do exactly what I say.

149
00:08:00,004 --> 00:08:01,604
Is that understood?

150
00:08:19,147 --> 00:08:20,922
They're treating you well?

151
00:08:21,322 --> 00:08:24,411
It's been a while since
I've spent this much time alone.

152
00:08:26,431 --> 00:08:28,291
So, I, uh...

153
00:08:29,773 --> 00:08:31,804
had time to think about some things.

154
00:08:37,204 --> 00:08:38,679
Like...

155
00:08:40,922 --> 00:08:44,051
Why didn't Daniel Miller
turn Shaw over to you,

156
00:08:44,187 --> 00:08:46,839
when he knew my freedom depended on it?

157
00:08:47,431 --> 00:08:50,927
And you. You could've quietly
let me leave the country.

158
00:08:51,042 --> 00:08:52,480
I would've done it for you.

159
00:08:52,545 --> 00:08:54,510
There wasn't time, Steven.

160
00:08:56,112 --> 00:08:57,922
You convinced me to push
a joint operation

161
00:08:57,898 --> 00:08:59,091
that ended in bloodshed.

162
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:01,767
It may be noble in America,
but not here.

163
00:09:01,895 --> 00:09:05,050
Oh, well... Oh, how does a German court

164
00:09:05,517 --> 00:09:07,183
produce an arrest warrant that fast?

165
00:09:07,259 --> 00:09:08,911
Nobody is that good at their job.

166
00:09:09,033 --> 00:09:11,501
We're known for our efficiency.

167
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:13,828
Then I started to think
about Thomas Shaw.

168
00:09:14,719 --> 00:09:18,753
And for months, he would randomly hit

169
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:20,590
station after station
all over the world.

170
00:09:20,677 --> 00:09:22,989
Then all of a sudden,
he decides he's gotta focus

171
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:25,828
entirely on my station.

172
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:30,406
Thomas Shaw works for you.

173
00:09:36,517 --> 00:09:38,935
Just tell me where he is.

174
00:09:41,709 --> 00:09:43,103
Why?

175
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:45,170
Why?

176
00:09:45,725 --> 00:09:48,325
So you can clean up
the last of the evidence,

177
00:09:48,515 --> 00:09:51,305
find Shaw, and then kill him?

178
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,023
Do your colleagues... do they
even know about this, Hans?

179
00:09:54,112 --> 00:09:55,739
Do they?

180
00:09:57,184 --> 00:09:58,567
No.

181
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:01,248
It's just you.

182
00:10:02,694 --> 00:10:04,452
Maybe Esther Krug?

183
00:10:05,431 --> 00:10:06,847
Why?

184
00:10:08,388 --> 00:10:10,215
What... Why would you want
to kill my station?

185
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:14,354
- What, I-I-I didn't...
- You have to ask, Steven?

186
00:10:14,631 --> 00:10:17,365
After you've listened to all
of Germany's telephone calls

187
00:10:17,468 --> 00:10:18,683
and read all our mail?

188
00:10:18,709 --> 00:10:21,183
After you have dragged us
into a war on terror

189
00:10:21,249 --> 00:10:23,183
that you started? You think that
with the Marshall Plan,

190
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:26,072
you bought this continent?
You did not. You did not.

191
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,146
That's politics! Don't hide behind that.

192
00:10:28,178 --> 00:10:30,545
You fucked me over
for months... months...

193
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:31,895
while you smiled in my face.

194
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:34,508
I wake each morning feeling
breath on the back of my neck.

195
00:10:34,564 --> 00:10:36,183
- You feel it, too.
- No, I don't.

196
00:10:36,184 --> 00:10:38,631
You know, the only thing
that I really feel is stupid

197
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:41,960
because I actually thought
that you were my friend.

198
00:10:44,384 --> 00:10:47,514
The things we do to hold on
to our position.

199
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:51,035
We move too fast.
We sacrifice our friends.

200
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:53,275
We push ill-advised operations
in shopping malls.

201
00:10:53,346 --> 00:10:56,903
Let's stop lying to each other, Steven.

202
00:10:58,184 --> 00:11:01,183
Everything we do is to delay
the inevitable.

203
00:11:01,767 --> 00:11:03,734
Tomorrow, we both lose.

204
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,305
Today, I win.

205
00:11:11,469 --> 00:11:14,469
See, you have no idea where Hector is.

206
00:11:16,924 --> 00:11:18,853
You haven't won a thing, Hans.

207
00:11:48,246 --> 00:11:50,612
Thank you.

208
00:12:21,218 --> 00:12:22,814
Hey, it's DeJean.

209
00:12:22,878 --> 00:12:26,184
I need to fly the unfriendly skies.

210
00:12:31,326 --> 00:12:34,326
So this is where you all hide.

211
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:40,381
When they come, what's gonna happen?

212
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:46,600
They will get us out of the country.

213
00:12:47,926 --> 00:12:49,847
This is my home, Daniel.

214
00:12:51,368 --> 00:12:53,114
This is Max's home.

215
00:12:53,217 --> 00:12:54,499
I know.

216
00:12:55,184 --> 00:12:58,183
But even if the BFV didn't
follow me to you,

217
00:12:58,302 --> 00:13:01,122
they still know you're my cousin
and they will find you.

218
00:13:11,644 --> 00:13:13,392
Still here.

219
00:13:13,535 --> 00:13:15,848
Robert needs me to get
into one of my agent files.

220
00:13:15,966 --> 00:13:18,966
Russian code clerk. Time-sensitive.

221
00:13:23,656 --> 00:13:25,452
She'll be gone tomorrow.

222
00:13:26,277 --> 00:13:27,686
Better be.

223
00:13:35,764 --> 00:13:36,813
I can't believe

224
00:13:36,852 --> 00:13:38,378
I'm letting you fucking do this.

225
00:13:38,435 --> 00:13:40,434
It's your plan. You wanna do it?

226
00:13:40,572 --> 00:13:43,939
No, this is your mess.
I'm not going to prison.

227
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:57,864
Got it.

228
00:14:01,184 --> 00:14:03,183
This is so fucked up.

229
00:14:03,364 --> 00:14:06,184
Just make the copies. Come on.

230
00:14:26,469 --> 00:14:27,770
Hi there.

231
00:14:28,932 --> 00:14:30,998
I work with Daniel. What's your name?

232
00:14:31,024 --> 00:14:32,307
This way.

233
00:14:47,777 --> 00:14:50,744
You're Clay Williams, counterterrorism.

234
00:14:50,921 --> 00:14:54,266
And you're Daniel Miller.
Come on. Give me some good news.

235
00:14:54,464 --> 00:14:56,500
Tell me how your mission's going.

236
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,622
Thomas Shaw.

237
00:15:00,209 --> 00:15:01,378
What are you talking about?

238
00:15:01,441 --> 00:15:04,317
Jemma Moore and I put together
a lot of harebrained schemes

239
00:15:04,444 --> 00:15:06,892
to try to being Shaw down,
but when she told me

240
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:10,586
about a case officer-
turned-analyst in Panama

241
00:15:10,689 --> 00:15:13,716
who wanted to go it alone,
I said she was crazy.

242
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,183
Was she?

243
00:15:16,564 --> 00:15:17,945
Look...

244
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:21,515
I don't know who Shaw is,

245
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,460
but I do know the Germans
are running him.

246
00:15:25,689 --> 00:15:28,002
Hans Richter's afraid
that I'll make this public.

247
00:15:28,049 --> 00:15:30,065
He just tried to kill me.

248
00:15:30,355 --> 00:15:31,967
Fuck me.

249
00:15:32,057 --> 00:15:35,056
The BFV is targeting
an American diplomat

250
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:37,184
in the middle of Berlin?

251
00:15:39,184 --> 00:15:40,865
They've gone completely off the rails.

252
00:15:40,937 --> 00:15:42,936
I'm pretty sure that he's outsourcing it

253
00:15:43,033 --> 00:15:45,019
to some criminal gangs.

254
00:15:45,184 --> 00:15:47,015
From where I'm standing,
it makes no difference.

255
00:15:47,102 --> 00:15:49,183
She and I need to be exfilled.

256
00:15:49,302 --> 00:15:51,852
She won't leave without her son.
He's in Munich.

257
00:15:53,521 --> 00:15:56,831
I'll arrange for both of you
and the kid to go stateside.

258
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:00,390
Just like that.

259
00:16:02,575 --> 00:16:04,448
Welcome to the seventh floor.

260
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:21,500
Have you heard anything?

261
00:16:21,685 --> 00:16:23,775
The Germans are barely speaking to us.
Oh, God.

262
00:16:23,974 --> 00:16:26,288
But they know better than
to mistreat Steven.

263
00:16:26,383 --> 00:16:28,184
He gave me this for you.

264
00:16:32,239 --> 00:16:35,238
- Do you mind taking a drive?
- No. Sure.

265
00:16:39,746 --> 00:16:42,183
This is a file on Zoltan Vasile,

266
00:16:42,478 --> 00:16:45,061
the Romanian who kidnapped
AleksandreIosava,

267
00:16:45,184 --> 00:16:47,555
the man the Germans think
that Steven hired.

268
00:16:47,722 --> 00:16:48,960
Well, did he?

269
00:16:49,644 --> 00:16:51,281
No, Kelly, he didn't.

270
00:16:51,535 --> 00:16:53,183
Well, I wouldn't know, would I?

271
00:16:53,244 --> 00:16:55,183
- He didn't.
- Yeah, well...

272
00:16:55,984 --> 00:16:58,543
guess you do know him better than I do.

273
00:17:02,372 --> 00:17:03,801
So what do we do now?

274
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:06,332
We see if we can't find Zoltan Vasile.

275
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:22,843
There was a moment I thought
you were not going to show up.

276
00:17:23,184 --> 00:17:26,771
You make me sad, Golda.

277
00:17:29,485 --> 00:17:33,911
In 1983, I was running a Lebanese agent.

278
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,939
He was with me for over a year

279
00:17:35,969 --> 00:17:38,606
before I brought him to meet my chief.

280
00:17:39,159 --> 00:17:41,985
At this meeting, the moment
he shook my chief's hand,

281
00:17:42,056 --> 00:17:43,635
he blew himself up.

282
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:48,434
I barely survived. My chief did not.

283
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:54,498
You, Robert, have only been
with me for a month.

284
00:17:55,367 --> 00:17:57,183
Well, I hope I live long enough

285
00:17:57,209 --> 00:18:00,029
to have as many fun stories as you.

286
00:18:24,802 --> 00:18:27,629
I don't know why you're
so interested in theIosavas.

287
00:18:27,674 --> 00:18:29,480
There was never anything to them,

288
00:18:29,646 --> 00:18:32,055
other than child brides in the desert.

289
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:36,830
What are you talking about?
Why are you telling me this now?

290
00:18:37,044 --> 00:18:39,817
If Steven Frost wants
to make a fool of himself,

291
00:18:39,894 --> 00:18:41,953
why should Mossad stand in the way?

292
00:18:42,049 --> 00:18:45,544
Robert Samuel Kirsch,
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

293
00:18:45,727 --> 00:18:48,588
We're taking you into custody
for espionage.

294
00:18:49,072 --> 00:18:51,184
Oh, fuck.

295
00:18:55,096 --> 00:18:56,699
Okay, okay.

296
00:18:57,382 --> 00:18:59,517
You fucking kidding me?

297
00:19:00,754 --> 00:19:02,406
Let's go.

298
00:19:05,081 --> 00:19:06,296
We will look out for you.

299
00:19:06,383 --> 00:19:08,989
Thanks, Golda, but I think I'm fucked.

300
00:19:16,706 --> 00:19:17,813
She buy it?

301
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:19,443
No way to tell with her.

302
00:19:20,151 --> 00:19:22,790
Can you get these fucking things
off of me, please?

303
00:19:28,671 --> 00:19:30,631
It's good to finally meet you,
Mr. Richter.

304
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:31,689
Mr. Williams.

305
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:36,664
I hope you haven't come all this way

306
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:39,102
to demand Steven Frost's release.

307
00:19:39,184 --> 00:19:42,446
No, no, I wouldn't presume to.

308
00:19:42,724 --> 00:19:44,553
That's a man who's made
some poor decisions,

309
00:19:44,602 --> 00:19:47,389
and he needs to face the consequences.

310
00:19:48,532 --> 00:19:51,448
So you are saying, officially,
that Steven Frost authorized

311
00:19:51,473 --> 00:19:53,966
the rendition of AleksandreIosava?

312
00:19:55,053 --> 00:19:58,184
Um, well, I'm not
saying anything officially.

313
00:20:00,735 --> 00:20:02,411
There's a reason we are meeting here.

314
00:20:02,475 --> 00:20:05,183
It's clean. No one can hear us.

315
00:20:09,213 --> 00:20:11,604
You're running Thomas Shaw.

316
00:20:13,451 --> 00:20:15,690
And in order to keep that a secret,

317
00:20:15,827 --> 00:20:18,357
you've been trying to kill
Daniel Miller.

318
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,049
Who the fuck does that?

319
00:20:21,604 --> 00:20:22,968
Huh?

320
00:20:23,807 --> 00:20:28,358
Now you give me Shaw, and we'll
straighten this mess out.

321
00:20:29,767 --> 00:20:32,292
You, on the other hand,
are trying to frame Steven Frost

322
00:20:32,332 --> 00:20:36,764
for theIosava rendition, when
we both know he didn't order it.

323
00:20:40,594 --> 00:20:43,376
You have Zoltan Vasile in custody?

324
00:20:43,463 --> 00:20:44,981
- Come on.
- Huh?

325
00:20:45,084 --> 00:20:47,348
He's in prison, under the protection

326
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:48,722
of the Prosecutor's Office.

327
00:20:48,779 --> 00:20:52,909
Okay. Let's do a little
free trade here, Hans.

328
00:20:53,064 --> 00:20:55,455
You take care of Zoltan Vasile.

329
00:20:55,932 --> 00:20:57,932
I'll take care of Daniel Miller.

330
00:21:00,645 --> 00:21:04,898
Surely you're not that
indifferent to your own people?

331
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:10,183
Hans, how the hell
did you survive the Cold War?

332
00:21:10,873 --> 00:21:13,494
What we do, we do for our countries.

333
00:21:13,558 --> 00:21:14,781
That's a given.

334
00:21:14,845 --> 00:21:17,339
And sometimes that means
we're the janitors.

335
00:21:17,394 --> 00:21:20,916
We have to get a big mop
and clean everything up.

336
00:21:21,624 --> 00:21:25,149
If it ever came out that
you were running Shaw,

337
00:21:25,253 --> 00:21:28,225
more than your career would
go down the toilet.

338
00:21:29,223 --> 00:21:31,222
I'm throwing you a lifeline.

339
00:22:22,685 --> 00:22:24,885
Shouldn't they have been here by now?

340
00:22:27,948 --> 00:22:29,691
There's a lot to arrange.

341
00:22:34,271 --> 00:22:36,632
I doubt we're their top priority.

342
00:22:48,188 --> 00:22:49,608
That's them?

343
00:22:49,666 --> 00:22:51,270
Shit.

344
00:22:51,961 --> 00:22:53,420
We need to go.

345
00:23:21,444 --> 00:23:23,978
- Hello?
- Wherever you are, get out now.

346
00:23:24,033 --> 00:23:25,245
You're too late. Are you...

347
00:23:25,271 --> 00:23:28,076
You were running him. You and
Hans, you were running Hector.

348
00:23:28,211 --> 00:23:31,008
- Now you're trying to kill us.
- No! I...

349
00:24:17,723 --> 00:24:19,605
Johnson, it's Daniel.

350
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:23,999
Listen, I have a strange
request, but it's important.

351
00:24:24,184 --> 00:24:26,183
It's in Hector's desk.

352
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:40,405
Headquarters fed us a line from day one.

353
00:24:40,445 --> 00:24:42,885
It's clear in every goddamn transcript.

354
00:24:44,703 --> 00:24:47,476
TheIosavas may have been
a nasty pair of matchmakers,

355
00:24:47,508 --> 00:24:50,183
but they were never
grade "A" terrorists.

356
00:24:50,404 --> 00:24:53,006
Or you were fishing for a cover story.

357
00:24:55,779 --> 00:25:01,538
Okay. Look, we're in this
together, like it or not.

358
00:25:03,019 --> 00:25:04,572
All right?

359
00:25:04,746 --> 00:25:07,648
So soon as Johnson collects
our intercepts from the SCIF,

360
00:25:07,687 --> 00:25:10,111
we'll take everything we've got
here down to the Station

361
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:12,536
and have a proper reckoning.

362
00:26:52,104 --> 00:26:53,226
Yeah?

363
00:26:56,255 --> 00:26:58,255
Thank you, Johnson.

364
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:04,538
All theIosava intercepts...

365
00:27:05,787 --> 00:27:07,381
shredded.

366
00:27:16,056 --> 00:27:17,056
Now do you believe me?

367
00:27:22,603 --> 00:27:27,124
You know what? Let's knock off,
get a few hours of sleep,

368
00:27:27,227 --> 00:27:29,387
wake up to another
fucked up day tomorrow.

369
00:27:29,506 --> 00:27:32,508
Whoa. You think you're
sleeping here tonight?

370
00:27:32,659 --> 00:27:34,775
I know you don't like me, Valerie,

371
00:27:35,064 --> 00:27:38,056
but do you really want a Mossad
bullet in the back of my head?

372
00:27:39,121 --> 00:27:42,310
I don't know.
How long do I get to decide?

373
00:27:45,588 --> 00:27:47,935
Why did Langley do this?

374
00:27:47,977 --> 00:27:50,090
That's what we're gonna find out.

375
00:27:58,627 --> 00:28:01,524
I'll tell you, I was surprised
when our Air Force attaché

376
00:28:01,571 --> 00:28:03,919
told me he'd just received
a landing clearance request

377
00:28:03,945 --> 00:28:06,737
- for the Director's plane.
- I don't have a lot of time, Franzen.

378
00:28:06,856 --> 00:28:08,428
I have a letter for the Ambassador.

379
00:28:08,482 --> 00:28:09,944
- It's from the White House.
- I'll deliver it.

380
00:28:10,009 --> 00:28:11,183
No, I will deliver it.

381
00:28:11,265 --> 00:28:13,838
You don't need to copy
Headquarters about our arrival.

382
00:28:13,864 --> 00:28:14,911
I will do that.

383
00:28:14,937 --> 00:28:17,859
James here will draft a message
for your commo to send.

384
00:28:18,046 --> 00:28:19,231
Let's go.

385
00:28:34,901 --> 00:28:36,950
You're alive.

386
00:28:37,223 --> 00:28:38,626
Barely.

387
00:28:38,957 --> 00:28:41,273
Probably not smart to be here.

388
00:28:41,876 --> 00:28:43,316
Probably not.

389
00:28:44,705 --> 00:28:48,915
Clay Williams...
he's trying to kill you.

390
00:28:49,065 --> 00:28:52,184
He made a deal with Hans.

391
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:01,165
Why did you call to warn me?

392
00:29:03,527 --> 00:29:05,480
I'd be one less person

393
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,325
that knew you and Hans
were running Thomas Shaw.

394
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:12,378
My death makes you safer.

395
00:29:12,513 --> 00:29:15,690
Yeah. Probably does.

396
00:29:25,327 --> 00:29:28,529
Germany's interests are more
important than your feelings.

397
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:30,703
Didn't you tell me that?

398
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:34,559
Of course I did.

399
00:29:36,365 --> 00:29:37,976
And they are.

400
00:29:41,616 --> 00:29:44,326
We almost had something, didn't we?

401
00:29:47,184 --> 00:29:48,375
Yes.

402
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,902
Where did Hector keep the files

403
00:30:05,997 --> 00:30:07,674
that he copied from the Station?

404
00:30:07,755 --> 00:30:09,615
Hmm?

405
00:30:11,271 --> 00:30:13,271
He would have kept a cache.

406
00:30:16,705 --> 00:30:18,601
We never found it.

407
00:30:50,184 --> 00:30:52,183
Ms. Mason, yes?

408
00:30:52,371 --> 00:30:57,291
I'm afraid I have difficult news
concerning Mr. Vasile.

409
00:31:11,059 --> 00:31:15,356
Well, my old cover worked,
but that's the only good news.

410
00:31:15,515 --> 00:31:19,184
Zoltan Vasile is dead.
They told me he hung himself.

411
00:31:20,231 --> 00:31:23,258
- Do you believe it?
- No.

412
00:31:29,088 --> 00:31:30,722
Todd, I want to introduce

413
00:31:30,786 --> 00:31:32,796
Michael Scheel
from the Director's Office.

414
00:31:32,867 --> 00:31:34,297
Michael, good to meet you.

415
00:31:34,352 --> 00:31:36,878
It's been a long flight, sir.
If I may...

416
00:31:39,716 --> 00:31:42,202
White House, huh?

417
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,850
And to be handled in CIA channels only?

418
00:31:54,028 --> 00:31:56,423
There's a cable on its way to you, sir.

419
00:31:56,716 --> 00:31:59,855
It says I can't even call back
on my secure terminal.

420
00:32:00,363 --> 00:32:02,580
I don't think the President
wants the NSA

421
00:32:02,635 --> 00:32:04,738
listening in on this one.

422
00:32:05,561 --> 00:32:09,588
Well, you, uh, you wanna
tell me what this one is?

423
00:32:13,284 --> 00:32:15,460
I'm gonna need this cable
sent off, stat.

424
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:17,236
Of course, sir.

425
00:32:27,112 --> 00:32:29,403
This guy's been linked
to Paris, Brussels.

426
00:32:29,474 --> 00:32:31,785
And last week, his name came up
in an interrogation

427
00:32:31,816 --> 00:32:34,797
about an imminent terror attack
on Manhattan.

428
00:32:35,217 --> 00:32:37,689
The Saudis, as usual,
don't know what they have.

429
00:32:37,808 --> 00:32:40,145
But I've got a ticking clock
and a chair for him

430
00:32:40,184 --> 00:32:42,183
at a black site in Morocco.

431
00:32:42,368 --> 00:32:44,148
I just need to sit him in it.

432
00:32:44,211 --> 00:32:45,585
What are the Saudis holding him for?

433
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:47,494
Sodomy.

434
00:32:47,597 --> 00:32:48,504
Sodomy?

435
00:32:48,529 --> 00:32:50,176
Like I said, they don't
know what they've got.

436
00:32:50,177 --> 00:32:53,183
And given that he worked for
Saudi Intelligence in Berlin,

437
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:55,684
I think it's best we don't tell 'em.

438
00:33:06,346 --> 00:33:09,913
Now I've got the CIA Director
chiming in with the White House.

439
00:33:10,917 --> 00:33:12,741
How dangerous is this guy?

440
00:33:19,184 --> 00:33:20,566
You okay?

441
00:33:26,247 --> 00:33:28,247
How did this all happen?

442
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:31,482
What?

443
00:33:32,261 --> 00:33:33,685
All of it.

444
00:33:33,827 --> 00:33:36,738
I thought theIosavas, um,
I thought it was important.

445
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,636
I thought it was crucial.

446
00:33:38,898 --> 00:33:41,027
People died, Robert.

447
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:46,555
Clare died in a fucking warehouse.

448
00:34:01,651 --> 00:34:03,249
Don't tell anybody I cried.

449
00:34:03,311 --> 00:34:04,916
I will kill you myself.

450
00:34:09,027 --> 00:34:11,376
I don't know why I'm trusting you.

451
00:34:13,499 --> 00:34:15,992
I don't know if
you're telling me the truth.

452
00:34:16,414 --> 00:34:17,954
Here's the truth.

453
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:23,254
Golda knew I was pissed at Steven

454
00:34:23,349 --> 00:34:25,312
after the Iran conference.

455
00:34:25,437 --> 00:34:28,806
She thought she saw
an opening there to turn me.

456
00:34:29,727 --> 00:34:34,448
I played along, figuring... eventually,

457
00:34:34,508 --> 00:34:37,736
I could feed Mossad whatever we wanted.

458
00:34:38,374 --> 00:34:40,121
Headquarters approved.

459
00:34:42,418 --> 00:34:44,801
I guess we never got to "eventually."

460
00:34:46,516 --> 00:34:48,253
What will you do?

461
00:34:48,453 --> 00:34:50,520
Move in with you, clearly.

462
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:12,184
- Hey.
- Hi.

463
00:35:13,649 --> 00:35:14,657
Hi.

464
00:35:14,696 --> 00:35:17,087
Why would the Germans want
to kill the man

465
00:35:17,135 --> 00:35:19,352
who kidnapped AleksandreIosava?

466
00:35:19,525 --> 00:35:21,158
Because Zoltan Vasile's confession

467
00:35:21,243 --> 00:35:23,183
wouldn't have led to Steven.

468
00:35:23,738 --> 00:35:25,602
But that's the question.

469
00:35:25,993 --> 00:35:28,274
Why does Hans Richter want
Steven to go down

470
00:35:28,357 --> 00:35:29,561
for the rendition?

471
00:35:29,633 --> 00:35:33,096
And why would headquarters
lie to us about theIosavas?

472
00:35:36,096 --> 00:35:38,070
Can you take a message to Steven?

473
00:35:38,165 --> 00:35:40,717
Yes, of course.

474
00:35:45,064 --> 00:35:48,248
Hello? Daniel.

475
00:35:48,851 --> 00:35:50,400
Where are you?

476
00:35:56,453 --> 00:35:58,441
Is this where you've been hiding out?

477
00:35:58,957 --> 00:36:00,515
Where's Hector?

478
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,359
I need your help.

479
00:36:23,707 --> 00:36:26,105
In two days, he'll meet
with the prosecutor

480
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:28,616
and be able to prove his innocence.

481
00:36:30,743 --> 00:36:34,743
Good. When are you seeing
the prosecutor?

482
00:36:40,391 --> 00:36:42,981
Don't say I never
did you a favor, Steven.

483
00:37:16,714 --> 00:37:20,044
- How are you?
- Absolutely wonderful.

484
00:37:21,184 --> 00:37:23,142
I didn't go see Sandra.

485
00:37:25,038 --> 00:37:28,876
And... I did not give her your gift.

486
00:37:31,759 --> 00:37:33,012
Oh.

487
00:37:34,401 --> 00:37:36,183
Oh.

488
00:37:36,652 --> 00:37:38,788
He's alive and well.

489
00:37:41,836 --> 00:37:43,229
Good.

490
00:37:44,184 --> 00:37:46,435
- Good.
- TheIosavas...

491
00:37:47,145 --> 00:37:49,183
All the information
you got from Headquarters

492
00:37:49,215 --> 00:37:51,480
was completely true.

493
00:37:52,824 --> 00:37:55,923
Clay Williams is not covering
anything up.

494
00:37:59,058 --> 00:38:01,469
I'm afraid our time is up.

495
00:38:17,715 --> 00:38:19,113
I'm in hiding...

496
00:38:20,322 --> 00:38:22,183
from Clay Williams.

497
00:38:22,888 --> 00:38:25,239
Clay Williams shredded
theIosava intercepts.

498
00:38:25,295 --> 00:38:27,052
Most of which were lies.

499
00:38:27,139 --> 00:38:30,118
Headquarters was pushing their
own agenda with theIosavas,

500
00:38:30,245 --> 00:38:32,010
and now they're trying to cover it up,

501
00:38:32,088 --> 00:38:33,946
framing Frost for the rendition.

502
00:38:34,671 --> 00:38:37,118
What about Zoltan Vasile?

503
00:38:37,205 --> 00:38:40,796
Zoltan Vasile mysteriously
hung himself in a German prison.

504
00:38:42,799 --> 00:38:44,077
Shit.

505
00:38:45,128 --> 00:38:47,400
Hans killed Zoltan Vasile for Clay.

506
00:38:48,924 --> 00:38:53,626
In exchange, Clay was gonna
kill me for Hans.

507
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,254
Wait.

508
00:38:55,287 --> 00:38:57,183
What are you talking about?

509
00:38:57,274 --> 00:39:00,827
- Is that why Clay's in Berlin?
- No, he's not here for me.

510
00:39:03,605 --> 00:39:05,605
He's here for Thomas Shaw.

511
00:39:08,969 --> 00:39:10,577
That's it.

512
00:39:12,186 --> 00:39:15,056
Clay drummed up
an obsession with theIosavas

513
00:39:15,082 --> 00:39:18,178
to try and flush Shaw out into the open.

514
00:39:19,041 --> 00:39:22,245
Distribute false intercepts
to a small circle of people

515
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:24,732
and watch to see who leaks them.

516
00:39:25,987 --> 00:39:27,696
An eyewash.

517
00:39:29,666 --> 00:39:31,523
But the fake intercepts were so good

518
00:39:31,595 --> 00:39:34,468
that somebody at the Agency
believed them.

519
00:39:35,584 --> 00:39:38,136
Decided to kidnap Iosava...

520
00:39:40,382 --> 00:39:42,606
One hand didn't know what the other
was doing.

521
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:44,951
And Steven's paying for it.

522
00:39:45,198 --> 00:39:46,715
Yeah?

523
00:39:49,037 --> 00:39:51,036
He says it's an eyewash.

524
00:39:53,438 --> 00:39:55,437
Steven agrees.

525
00:39:55,979 --> 00:39:59,183
I got what you asked for
from Hector's desk.

526
00:39:59,247 --> 00:40:00,478
Thank you.

527
00:40:01,574 --> 00:40:04,183
What's this? What are you doing?

528
00:40:05,173 --> 00:40:07,183
We can prove the eyewash

529
00:40:07,809 --> 00:40:10,475
if we can find copies
of the original intercepts.

530
00:40:11,082 --> 00:40:12,183
Copies?

531
00:40:12,289 --> 00:40:14,427
Yeah. Thomas Shaw made copies.

532
00:40:15,578 --> 00:40:17,589
How do you know that, Daniel?

533
00:40:23,255 --> 00:40:25,255
Because I know who he is.

534
00:40:32,621 --> 00:40:34,621
Hector is Thomas Shaw.

535
00:40:39,585 --> 00:40:41,585
Hector?

536
00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:46,310
- No.
- Valerie...

537
00:40:53,485 --> 00:40:54,746
Okay.

538
00:40:55,589 --> 00:41:00,184
So if Hector is Thomas Shaw,
then who the fuck are you?

539
00:41:02,825 --> 00:41:04,824
I was sent here to find him.

540
00:41:06,073 --> 00:41:08,637
I'm the one who turned
the spotlight on Berlin.

541
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:12,599
I opened the door to all of this.

542
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:19,567
And we need to close it
once and for all.

543
00:42:00,469 --> 00:42:01,909
No.

544
00:42:21,368 --> 00:42:25,142
- Golda.
- Hans. I have information.

545
00:42:26,184 --> 00:42:28,744
My people spotted
some Americans of interest

546
00:42:28,824 --> 00:42:30,609
at the Kollhoff Tower.

547
00:42:31,284 --> 00:42:33,318
Robert Kirsch, Daniel Miller,

548
00:42:33,389 --> 00:42:36,686
and Valerie Edwards is already inside.

549
00:42:38,405 --> 00:42:40,014
What are they doing?

550
00:42:40,812 --> 00:42:42,635
They are debriefing a mole

551
00:42:42,699 --> 00:42:45,427
they have been running inside
the Reichstag.

552
00:42:46,632 --> 00:42:48,499
Why are you telling me this?

553
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:51,861
Because I always pay people back.

554
00:44:17,612 --> 00:44:19,017
Welcome to Europe's fastest elevator.

555
00:44:19,088 --> 00:44:21,520
In only 20 seconds, we'll be
already at 90 meters high.

556
00:44:21,583 --> 00:44:23,745
At a speed of 8.5 meters per second,

557
00:44:23,795 --> 00:44:26,794
30 kilometers per hour,
and we're already there.

558
00:44:57,090 --> 00:44:58,479
Clear so far.

559
00:45:47,977 --> 00:45:49,138
Four coming in, Robert.

560
00:45:49,184 --> 00:45:50,743
Got it. Thanks.

561
00:46:21,156 --> 00:46:22,759
Valerie Edwards!

562
00:46:24,804 --> 00:46:26,073
Okay. Okay.

563
00:46:26,286 --> 00:46:30,562
Hey! Oh! I'm an American diplomat.

564
00:46:35,964 --> 00:46:37,433
We got company.

565
00:46:38,657 --> 00:46:40,183
I swear to God,
if this doesn't work out,

566
00:46:40,189 --> 00:46:41,923
- I'll fucking kill Hector.
- And if it does?

567
00:46:41,969 --> 00:46:43,969
I'll fucking kill him anyway.

568
00:46:51,966 --> 00:46:54,022
Uhh!

569
00:46:54,072 --> 00:46:56,692
Uhh!

570
00:46:58,846 --> 00:47:00,681
I got it.

571
00:47:01,204 --> 00:47:04,266
Get the fuck out of here. Go.

572
00:47:05,186 --> 00:47:06,973
Hey, guys. What's going on?

573
00:47:06,999 --> 00:47:07,989
Robert Kirsch?

574
00:47:08,014 --> 00:47:09,792
Yeah, that's who I am. Why?
What do you need?

575
00:47:09,887 --> 00:47:12,836
Hey. Hey! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Take it easy.

576
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:14,614
Where's she going?

577
00:48:02,704 --> 00:48:04,538
What do you got?

578
00:48:04,689 --> 00:48:07,748
Where is it Daniel? Where is it? Huh?

579
00:48:08,184 --> 00:48:09,835
Where is it?

580
00:48:13,003 --> 00:48:15,260
You son of a bitch.

581
00:48:32,912 --> 00:48:36,187
My name is Thomas Shaw,

582
00:48:36,917 --> 00:48:39,144
and this is my final message.

583
00:48:42,030 --> 00:48:43,979
From the start, I have tried to make

584
00:48:44,006 --> 00:48:47,184
the Central Intelligence Agency
accountable for its actions.

585
00:48:49,715 --> 00:48:52,271
I have not always succeeded...

586
00:48:54,302 --> 00:48:55,772
But I have tried.

587
00:48:57,562 --> 00:48:59,452
And along the way...

588
00:49:00,871 --> 00:49:03,459
I ruined the lives of many people.

589
00:49:06,632 --> 00:49:10,795
Now I need to be accountable
for my own actions.

590
00:49:19,379 --> 00:49:22,183
The CIA's hunt for Thomas Shaw,

591
00:49:22,451 --> 00:49:24,978
through what it calls an "eyewash,"

592
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:27,536
has resulted in too many deaths,

593
00:49:27,639 --> 00:49:29,484
too much destruction.

594
00:49:30,889 --> 00:49:32,533
To what end?

595
00:49:33,486 --> 00:49:35,880
They still don't know who I am,

596
00:49:36,623 --> 00:49:38,622
and they will never know.

597
00:49:39,696 --> 00:49:41,849
All that's left of their deceit...

598
00:49:42,935 --> 00:49:44,433
are broken bodies

599
00:49:46,051 --> 00:49:47,524
and broken lives.

600
00:49:51,799 --> 00:49:55,177
It would be irresponsible
to continue on my path.

601
00:49:55,953 --> 00:49:57,994
It would make me no better
than they are.

602
00:50:01,373 --> 00:50:02,863
And so...

603
00:50:03,852 --> 00:50:05,224
goodbye.

604
00:50:09,263 --> 00:50:11,938
Some will ask who Thomas Shaw was.

605
00:50:13,073 --> 00:50:14,395
A man.

606
00:50:15,509 --> 00:50:16,848
A woman.

607
00:50:18,532 --> 00:50:19,927
A collective.

608
00:50:20,928 --> 00:50:24,183
In Berlin, people on the street say,

609
00:50:24,351 --> 00:50:25,761
"I am Shaw"...

610
00:50:26,513 --> 00:50:31,115
men, women, children.

611
00:50:32,104 --> 00:50:36,104
The fact is, we're all complicit.

612
00:50:38,015 --> 00:50:40,266
We all know something is wrong.

613
00:50:41,015 --> 00:50:42,786
We've known it for a long time.

614
00:50:44,334 --> 00:50:46,080
But we do nothing.

615
00:50:47,421 --> 00:50:52,119
Exposing wrongs is not
the same as righting them.

616
00:50:52,846 --> 00:50:56,211
Governments are not moved by shame.

617
00:50:57,489 --> 00:51:00,699
Actually changing things
with your own hands?

618
00:51:01,070 --> 00:51:03,070
That's the hard part.

619
00:51:06,428 --> 00:51:09,183
If Thomas Shaw represents change,

620
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:11,495
then show me the change,

621
00:51:12,776 --> 00:51:14,789
and then I'll say that I was him.

622
00:51:17,445 --> 00:51:18,756
Until then...

623
00:51:19,592 --> 00:51:21,390
we could be anybody.
