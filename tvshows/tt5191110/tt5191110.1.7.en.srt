00:00:02,133 --> 00:00:05,132
Our agent, Bora Osman, has asked Iosava

3
00:00:05,133 --> 00:00:07,132
to send one of his relatives to Syria.

4
00:00:07,133 --> 00:00:08,132
Clare Itani?

5
00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:10,730
She will be acting
as the ISIL bride-to-be.

6
00:00:10,755 --> 00:00:13,132
I'm a bride for the Caliphate.
That's the setup.

7
00:00:13,133 --> 00:00:15,132
Get a confession, and
we finally bring down Iosava.

8
00:00:15,133 --> 00:00:16,560
Okay, I'm in. Sign me up.

9
00:00:16,561 --> 00:00:18,548
You are involved with Clare.

10
00:00:18,549 --> 00:00:20,132
It is out of the question.

11
00:00:20,133 --> 00:00:23,132
You made some important
people in Tel Aviv very happy.

12
00:00:23,133 --> 00:00:25,642
You want to be nearer
to your son, don't you?

13
00:00:25,649 --> 00:00:26,802

14
00:00:26,815 --> 00:00:28,049
_

15
00:00:28,133 --> 00:00:29,133
Good.

16
00:00:29,165 --> 00:00:32,138
_

17
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:34,108
_

18
00:00:34,133 --> 00:00:36,132
Where the fuck is her husband?

19
00:00:36,133 --> 00:00:37,132
What the fuck are you doing here?

20
00:00:37,133 --> 00:00:40,132
- DeJean is here.
- Can we get him out of there?

21
00:00:40,133 --> 00:00:43,132
Call it off. Someone's nabbed
Iosava off the street.

22
00:00:43,133 --> 00:00:44,696
You're coming with us,
or we will kill you both!

23
00:00:44,697 --> 00:00:46,132
- What?
- Get them out of there, now!

24
00:00:46,133 --> 00:00:48,133
Abort. I repeat, abort.

25
00:00:48,197 --> 00:00:49,108
_

26
00:00:52,616 --> 00:00:53,698
Shit!

27
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,840
Down!

28
00:00:58,133 --> 00:01:00,132
In pursuit, blue van... Berlin plates,

29
00:01:00,133 --> 00:01:04,133
Bravo-Walker-Alpha 2-6-4-7.

30
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:10,132
They're not in the van.
They ran a bait and switch.

31
00:01:10,133 --> 00:01:11,781
A rendition
in the middle of an operation?

32
00:01:11,782 --> 00:01:13,654
What the... What's the matter with you?!

33
00:01:13,655 --> 00:01:15,132
I'm gonna get our officer back

34
00:01:15,133 --> 00:01:16,132
with or without your fucking help,

35
00:01:16,133 --> 00:01:19,133
and when I get her back, I resign.

36
00:01:20,133 --> 00:01:21,132
Hey, hey, stop, stop.

37
00:01:21,133 --> 00:01:23,132
- Fucking find her.
- Stop, stop.

38
00:01:23,133 --> 00:01:24,132
We got to fucking find her.

39
00:01:24,133 --> 00:01:27,133
- It's okay. It's okay.
- We have to find her.

42
00:02:29,007 --> 00:02:30,543
They took my husband.

43
00:02:32,007 --> 00:02:36,007
Tell me where he is, and this
will go a lot easier for you.

44
00:02:39,007 --> 00:02:43,007
You being stoic
is you being stupid, my dear.

45
00:02:46,007 --> 00:02:48,006
Don't make the same mistake
your people made

46
00:02:48,007 --> 00:02:50,007
and underestimate me.

47
00:03:21,007 --> 00:03:23,006
Hector?

48
00:03:23,007 --> 00:03:26,007
Uh, yeah.

49
00:03:27,567 --> 00:03:30,006
Okay. Okay.

50
00:03:31,007 --> 00:03:32,914
Ruth Iosava just made contact.

51
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:37,006
Yeah, I-I understand.

52
00:03:37,007 --> 00:03:38,006
But as fast as you can.

53
00:03:38,007 --> 00:03:40,006
Hey, everybody, listen up. Listen up.

54
00:03:40,007 --> 00:03:44,006
At 3:38 A.M., Ruth Iosava
contacted headquarters

55
00:03:44,007 --> 00:03:47,006
via an anonymous Internet video call.

56
00:03:47,007 --> 00:03:50,006
That's 6 hours and 35 minutes

57
00:03:50,007 --> 00:03:52,021
after the abduction of Clare Itani.

58
00:03:53,007 --> 00:03:56,006
She has also requested
a call with this station

59
00:03:56,007 --> 00:03:58,006
at 4:00 A.M. sharp.

60
00:03:58,007 --> 00:04:00,006
Now, Johnson and his team

61
00:04:00,007 --> 00:04:02,006
are working to trace
the origins of the call,

62
00:04:02,007 --> 00:04:03,006
but right now, we're negotiating.

63
00:04:03,007 --> 00:04:05,006
And I just... I want to make it clear

64
00:04:05,007 --> 00:04:07,006
to everybody here, uh...

65
00:04:07,007 --> 00:04:08,006
I'm gonna do whatever I can

66
00:04:08,007 --> 00:04:10,382
to bring her back here
safe and sound, okay?

67
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:11,622
Now, I know it's late,

68
00:04:11,623 --> 00:04:13,468
and I want to thank everybody
for hanging in there.

69
00:04:13,469 --> 00:04:15,006
Langley will help facilitate the call.

70
00:04:15,007 --> 00:04:17,006
So, what, we stand around for a pep talk

71
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:19,006
while you, what, negotiate?

72
00:04:19,007 --> 00:04:21,817
Ruth Iosava is an ISIL radical.

73
00:04:21,818 --> 00:04:24,006
They don't negotiate. They decapitate.

74
00:04:24,007 --> 00:04:25,006
What are you suggesting?

75
00:04:25,007 --> 00:04:27,006
You want us to go after Clare
with guns blazing?

76
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:29,489
Jesus Chri... I... You know,
I would have thought

77
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:31,006
you'd have learned your lesson

78
00:04:31,007 --> 00:04:33,006
after you recklessly
inserted yourself in the mall

79
00:04:33,007 --> 00:04:34,006
with an unapproved weapon.

80
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:36,006
Someone had to shore up
your poor judgment.

81
00:04:36,007 --> 00:04:38,006
Oh, give it a fucking rest, Hector!

82
00:04:38,007 --> 00:04:41,006
What kind of fucking
incontinent, geriatric call

83
00:04:41,007 --> 00:04:44,092
was that in the first place,
sending Clare to the gallows?

84
00:04:46,007 --> 00:04:47,353
Get out.

85
00:04:48,007 --> 00:04:50,007
Gladly.

86
00:04:52,007 --> 00:04:54,659
Hector, we need you.

87
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:59,006
There is no fucking "we"
anymore, Daniel.

88
00:05:00,737 --> 00:05:03,006
All right, four minutes. Back at it.

89
00:05:03,007 --> 00:05:05,006
- Let me go after him.
- No, I need you here, Daniel.

90
00:05:05,007 --> 00:05:07,593
If Hector's out there
acting on his emotions,

91
00:05:07,594 --> 00:05:09,006
snooping around,

92
00:05:09,007 --> 00:05:10,006
and this thing leaks
before we find Clare,

93
00:05:10,007 --> 00:05:12,006
she's as good as dead.

94
00:05:12,007 --> 00:05:13,006
Okay, all right, just tread lightly.

95
00:05:13,007 --> 00:05:15,006
Lock him down
and keep me in the loop, okay?

96
00:05:15,007 --> 00:05:16,185
You got it.

97
00:05:24,687 --> 00:05:26,687
_

98
00:05:27,314 --> 00:05:28,339
_

99
00:05:28,413 --> 00:05:34,440
_

100
00:05:34,653 --> 00:05:35,652
And you are?

101
00:05:36,007 --> 00:05:38,131
- Paul.
- Paul.

102
00:05:39,007 --> 00:05:40,006
In quotation marks, I assume.

103
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:42,006
I see you've taken
your own security precautions.

104
00:05:42,007 --> 00:05:45,006
But I have the disadvantage
of not knowing your real name

105
00:05:45,007 --> 00:05:46,405
while you know mine.

106
00:05:47,007 --> 00:05:49,283
That puts us on distinctly
unequal footing.

107
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:51,006
Well, I hope that tonight's concerns

108
00:05:51,007 --> 00:05:53,006
will have little to do with you or me.

109
00:05:53,448 --> 00:05:56,006
You people can be very polite
when you want something.

110
00:05:56,007 --> 00:05:58,006
You want something, too.

111
00:05:58,007 --> 00:05:59,638
I don't see why
we can't be civil about it.

112
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:01,006
Well, Paul,

113
00:06:01,007 --> 00:06:03,006
my husband, Aleksandre,
has been abducted off the street

114
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:06,006
on the whim of civilized men
like yourself.

115
00:06:06,355 --> 00:06:08,006
When you turn over my husband,
she's yours.

116
00:06:08,007 --> 00:06:11,006
And Aleksandre and I
are given safe passage to Syria.

117
00:06:11,007 --> 00:06:12,347
Well...

118
00:06:13,007 --> 00:06:15,006
That transaction's
easier said than done.

119
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:18,006
We have certain steps
that we have to follow,

120
00:06:18,007 --> 00:06:19,735
such as proof of life...

121
00:06:21,187 --> 00:06:23,006
confirmation that she's alive
and unharmed.

122
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:25,006
And I need the same of my husband.

123
00:06:25,007 --> 00:06:26,581
I'll make contact again in two hours.

124
00:06:26,582 --> 00:06:28,004
Frau Iosava...

125
00:06:29,007 --> 00:06:30,006
Wow.

126
00:06:30,007 --> 00:06:34,007
Please don't tell me
that's the new face of ISIL.

127
00:06:41,007 --> 00:06:42,007
Danke.

128
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:49,006
- What, you're following me?
- Yeah, kind of.

129
00:06:49,007 --> 00:06:52,006
I just wanted to say
there is a "we" here...

130
00:06:52,007 --> 00:06:54,006
you and I, whether you like it or not.

131
00:06:54,007 --> 00:06:55,748
All right. I take it you have a plan.

132
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,006
Same as Frost... find Clare.

133
00:06:57,007 --> 00:06:58,474
What, you know something
he doesn't know,

134
00:06:58,475 --> 00:07:00,006
or are you counting on the good
Lord to show you the way?

135
00:07:00,007 --> 00:07:02,006
All right, so Frost put you
up to this. That figures.

136
00:07:02,007 --> 00:07:04,006
No, I put me up to this,
not just for your sake,

137
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:06,006
- but for Clare's.
- Daniel, you're a company man.

138
00:07:06,007 --> 00:07:08,006
There's no harm in that. So was I once.

139
00:07:08,007 --> 00:07:09,006
But tonight, you're in bad company.

140
00:07:09,007 --> 00:07:10,479
And you're no good to anyone

141
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,006
running around Berlin
on some cockeyed manhunt.

142
00:07:12,007 --> 00:07:13,561
Well, who's gonna find her if I don't?

143
00:07:13,586 --> 00:07:15,278
We're on it, Frost's on it.
The Germans are looking...

144
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:17,006
The Germans?! Fuck the fucking Germans!

145
00:07:17,007 --> 00:07:19,006
Okay, fuck the Germans.
You clearly have a better plan.

146
00:07:19,007 --> 00:07:21,550
What's step one? Get wasted?

147
00:07:25,007 --> 00:07:27,006
- I want to find that van.
- Oh, go on.

148
00:07:27,007 --> 00:07:29,006
Robert's guys did a sweep.
They didn't find anything.

149
00:07:29,007 --> 00:07:30,006
- They think it was a decoy.
- Jesus.

150
00:07:30,007 --> 00:07:32,006
He gets in one fucking car chase,

151
00:07:32,007 --> 00:07:34,006
and he thinks he's fucking Vin Diesel.

152
00:07:34,007 --> 00:07:35,006
I'd prefer to look for myself.

153
00:07:35,007 --> 00:07:37,006
What... What, the impound?

154
00:07:40,007 --> 00:07:42,006
That's my boy.

155
00:07:42,007 --> 00:07:44,006
I'll drive.

156
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:48,006
It's MI6, the Russians.

157
00:07:48,007 --> 00:07:50,006
Who else would want Iosava?

158
00:07:50,007 --> 00:07:53,304
You're forgetting one name... us.

159
00:07:54,007 --> 00:07:56,661
I haven't forgotten,
but not during an operation.

160
00:07:56,662 --> 00:07:58,006
There you are.

161
00:07:58,007 --> 00:08:01,006
I'm sorry for the circumstances.
I just received the cable.

162
00:08:01,007 --> 00:08:03,598
- We're at a loss here, Clay.
- I am well aware.

163
00:08:03,623 --> 00:08:06,006
The last thing we want is
to lose an asset in the field.

164
00:08:06,007 --> 00:08:08,006
Clare is not an asset.
She's one of my people.

165
00:08:08,007 --> 00:08:12,006
And the only way to get her back
is to swap for Iosava.

166
00:08:12,007 --> 00:08:14,006
We can't trade what we don't have.

167
00:08:14,007 --> 00:08:17,006
We just got word Romanian
Intelligence was involved.

168
00:08:17,007 --> 00:08:20,745
Uh, Valerie Edwards, Global Affairs.

169
00:08:20,746 --> 00:08:23,006
Why on earth would SRI do that?

170
00:08:23,007 --> 00:08:26,006
We've seen no intelligence
linking Iosava's network

171
00:08:26,007 --> 00:08:28,006
- to Romania.
- We have.

172
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:31,006
Apparently, SRI have had
their eyes on him for some time.

173
00:08:31,007 --> 00:08:34,006
Iosava has heavy involvement in
the black market in Bucharest.

174
00:08:34,007 --> 00:08:36,409
Okay, regardless, I need proof of life

175
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:38,006
if this negotiation's gonna go forward.

176
00:08:38,007 --> 00:08:40,006
We've already reached out
to the Romanians.

177
00:08:40,007 --> 00:08:41,663
Oh, come on. That's it?

178
00:08:41,664 --> 00:08:43,725
You reached out?
That... That's all you got?

179
00:08:43,726 --> 00:08:45,006
And you are?

180
00:08:45,007 --> 00:08:46,704
Robert Kirsch, Deputy Chief.

181
00:08:46,705 --> 00:08:49,006
Robert, you know as much as I do now.

182
00:08:49,007 --> 00:08:52,006
Clay, she's 28 years old.

183
00:08:52,007 --> 00:08:55,006
This is her first tour.
We really need her back, okay?

184
00:08:55,007 --> 00:08:58,006
- Then let's get on it.
- Thank you.

185
00:08:58,007 --> 00:08:59,928
Fuck!

186
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:03,006
75 minutes till Ruth Iosava calls,

187
00:09:03,007 --> 00:09:05,006
and we got jack shit!

188
00:09:05,007 --> 00:09:06,006
Light a fire under Johnson.

189
00:09:06,007 --> 00:09:07,116
Just...

190
00:09:12,007 --> 00:09:13,524
Johnson.

191
00:09:14,007 --> 00:09:16,006
- Tell me you have good news.
- We've tracked her log-in session

192
00:09:16,007 --> 00:09:18,006
through a global proxy chain
of six hubs,

193
00:09:18,007 --> 00:09:21,006
but we've hit one that I think
is under the control

194
00:09:21,007 --> 00:09:23,006
of Chinese Third Department.

195
00:09:23,007 --> 00:09:26,261
We're unlikely to crack it
anytime soon, but we're trying.

196
00:09:34,007 --> 00:09:37,194
You wouldn't happen
to have any of those, um...

197
00:09:38,007 --> 00:09:40,007
Oh, thank you.

198
00:09:48,007 --> 00:09:51,006
I know it's my Western privilege
talking, but...

199
00:09:51,331 --> 00:09:54,006
I fail to see how someone
can go from that

200
00:09:54,298 --> 00:09:56,381
to someone who's willing to kill
and be killed

201
00:09:56,382 --> 00:10:01,006
for an archaic, misogynistic
death cult like ISIL.

202
00:10:01,007 --> 00:10:04,006
Fell for the wrong guy, I guess.

203
00:10:04,007 --> 00:10:07,006
Right. Because women can't fall
for bad ideology,

204
00:10:07,007 --> 00:10:08,346
only bad men.

205
00:10:11,192 --> 00:10:13,225
Why don't you go home, get some sleep?

206
00:10:14,007 --> 00:10:15,681
I'm going for a food run.

207
00:10:18,007 --> 00:10:20,006
Is kebab okay?

208
00:10:20,007 --> 00:10:21,006
It's the only thing that's open.

209
00:10:21,007 --> 00:10:24,006
Yeah, kebab. That's perfect.

210
00:10:30,007 --> 00:10:31,695
Hans?

211
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:37,737
_

212
00:10:37,764 --> 00:10:39,217
_

213
00:10:39,234 --> 00:10:40,680
_

214
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:43,632
_

215
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:45,950
_

216
00:10:50,007 --> 00:10:52,006
Yeah?

217
00:10:52,007 --> 00:10:54,006
Um, I'm sorry I haven't called, Hans,

218
00:10:54,007 --> 00:10:56,006
but I've been dealing with Washington.

219
00:10:56,007 --> 00:10:58,006
About what happened at the mall

220
00:10:58,007 --> 00:11:01,006
or what happened to Aleksandre Iosava?

221
00:11:01,007 --> 00:11:03,792
I'm going to ask you this once
as a friend.

222
00:11:03,793 --> 00:11:06,373
You don't even have to
ask the question, Hans.

223
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:08,497
Because in what world does it make sense

224
00:11:08,498 --> 00:11:10,734
that I would risk the life
of one of my officers

225
00:11:10,735 --> 00:11:12,006
to take Iosava?

226
00:11:12,007 --> 00:11:14,267
Your masters have wanted to all along.

227
00:11:14,734 --> 00:11:17,006
Tell me, Steven, did Langley
finally get its way?

228
00:11:17,007 --> 00:11:20,335
They would never do that
in the middle of an operation.

229
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:22,702
Look, Hans, um...

230
00:11:24,007 --> 00:11:25,496
Does your team have any leads

231
00:11:25,497 --> 00:11:28,006
as to where Ruth might have
taken my officer?

232
00:11:28,007 --> 00:11:31,006
Not yet. And now I must
meet with Chancellor Merkel

233
00:11:31,007 --> 00:11:34,006
to convince her
the gunmen who shot up a mall

234
00:11:34,007 --> 00:11:37,006
aren't linked to the refugees.

235
00:11:37,007 --> 00:11:38,385
Yeah.

236
00:11:43,146 --> 00:11:44,859
_

237
00:11:45,106 --> 00:11:47,106
_

238
00:11:56,514 --> 00:11:58,514
_

239
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:03,692
_

240
00:12:04,199 --> 00:12:06,199
_

241
00:12:07,914 --> 00:12:09,914
_

242
00:12:10,182 --> 00:12:12,750
_

243
00:12:14,007 --> 00:12:14,962
Uh-huh.

244
00:12:14,989 --> 00:12:16,989
_

245
00:12:18,295 --> 00:12:21,693
_

246
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:24,630
_

247
00:12:25,431 --> 00:12:27,431
_

248
00:12:28,617 --> 00:12:32,881
_

249
00:12:33,735 --> 00:12:37,791
_

250
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:39,445
If there was a clue left behind,

251
00:12:39,446 --> 00:12:42,006
don't you think it would be with
the police in an evidence bag?

252
00:12:42,007 --> 00:12:45,007
Theoretically speaking, yes.

253
00:13:03,499 --> 00:13:05,498
Holy shit.

254
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:06,619
What?

255
00:13:07,007 --> 00:13:09,570
"I do." She left a message.

256
00:13:11,007 --> 00:13:13,006
What, a marriage proposal?

257
00:13:13,007 --> 00:13:16,006
No, no, no, no.
She... She borrowed a-a ring

258
00:13:16,007 --> 00:13:19,194
from me this morning,
said she needed it for cover.

259
00:13:19,706 --> 00:13:21,691
- Wait a second.
- What?

260
00:13:22,872 --> 00:13:23,871
Wedding.

261
00:13:24,007 --> 00:13:26,042
- That's what I'm saying.
- No.

262
00:13:27,007 --> 00:13:28,006
No, the neighborhood.

263
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:29,383
"Vedding."

264
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:31,521
Maybe that's the message.

265
00:13:31,546 --> 00:13:34,006
Oh, Clare, you genius.

266
00:13:34,007 --> 00:13:38,007
And you, Daniel Miller, well done.

267
00:13:49,259 --> 00:13:50,535
Yeah?

268
00:13:52,007 --> 00:13:54,006
Yeah, put him through.

269
00:13:54,007 --> 00:13:57,178
Valerie? I got someone here
who wants to talk to you.

270
00:13:58,419 --> 00:13:59,418
Hey.

271
00:13:59,729 --> 00:14:00,982
Hector, where are you?

272
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:02,285
At a roadblock.

273
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:05,279
At least the Germans know
a manhunt is in order.

274
00:14:06,328 --> 00:14:08,010
You're going after her?

275
00:14:08,644 --> 00:14:10,006
And if I was?

276
00:14:10,007 --> 00:14:12,006
Officially,
I'd have to tell you to stop,

277
00:14:12,007 --> 00:14:13,604
insist you come back to the embassy.

278
00:14:13,605 --> 00:14:16,337
Yeah, well, Frost sent me home,
so scratch that option.

279
00:14:16,619 --> 00:14:17,691
Unofficially.

280
00:14:17,718 --> 00:14:18,832
_

281
00:14:19,007 --> 00:14:20,151
Hold on a sec.

282
00:14:20,544 --> 00:14:22,120
_

283
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:27,193
_

284
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,612
_

285
00:14:29,007 --> 00:14:31,007
Auf wiedersehen.

286
00:14:37,007 --> 00:14:39,006
Answer me this, Val.

287
00:14:39,007 --> 00:14:42,006
What would Clare have us do...
sit back and negotiate,

288
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:44,191
or turn over every stone
until we found her?

289
00:14:45,007 --> 00:14:46,006
Both.

290
00:14:46,007 --> 00:14:47,661
Fair enough.

291
00:14:48,007 --> 00:14:49,358
So will you help me?

292
00:14:50,007 --> 00:14:51,006
I'm listening.

293
00:14:51,007 --> 00:14:53,006
She left a message in the van.

294
00:14:53,007 --> 00:14:55,006
We're heading to Wedding.

295
00:14:55,007 --> 00:14:57,006
I'll make some inquiries, yeah.

296
00:14:57,007 --> 00:15:00,007
Can you give me access to Brown Bear?

297
00:15:03,007 --> 00:15:06,007
It's Clare, Val. It's all or nothing.

298
00:15:09,007 --> 00:15:11,007
Meet me there in an hour.

299
00:15:14,007 --> 00:15:15,767
Brown Bear?

300
00:15:17,007 --> 00:15:19,006
Means she has my back.

301
00:15:19,007 --> 00:15:21,383
And yours.

302
00:15:28,007 --> 00:15:30,007
I need smokes.

303
00:15:36,007 --> 00:15:38,540
Sandra, it's Daniel. Do you have Steven?

304
00:15:40,007 --> 00:15:41,959
Daniel on line one.

305
00:15:48,007 --> 00:15:50,006
How's he doing?

306
00:15:50,007 --> 00:15:52,006
What if I told you
we were onto something?

307
00:15:52,007 --> 00:15:53,283
What do you mean you're onto something?

308
00:15:53,284 --> 00:15:54,499
You're supposed to be locking him down.

309
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,006
Events took a turn.

310
00:15:56,007 --> 00:15:59,006
I'm not getting any younger
here, Daniel. Come on.

311
00:15:59,007 --> 00:16:01,006
We searched the van.

312
00:16:01,007 --> 00:16:03,006
Wait, you broke into
a fucking impound lot?

313
00:16:03,007 --> 00:16:04,564
Listen, Clare left a message

314
00:16:04,565 --> 00:16:07,094
that seems to indicate
they're holding her in Wedding.

315
00:16:07,586 --> 00:16:08,897
Jesus.

316
00:16:09,624 --> 00:16:11,621
- Where in Wedding?
- That's all we have right now.

317
00:16:11,646 --> 00:16:13,645
Yeah. Okay, well...

318
00:16:14,007 --> 00:16:17,006
Come back here for a debrief,
and I'll get a team on it.

319
00:16:17,007 --> 00:16:18,491
No, you already have a team on it.

320
00:16:18,492 --> 00:16:21,006
No, no. No. He's a mess.

321
00:16:21,007 --> 00:16:22,403
He's too close to this. No.

322
00:16:22,404 --> 00:16:24,255
We don't have time for all that.

323
00:16:25,007 --> 00:16:27,495
- I got to go.
- Da...

324
00:16:40,486 --> 00:16:41,485
Jesus.

325
00:16:42,007 --> 00:16:44,213
What are these, street-cam photos?

326
00:16:44,706 --> 00:16:47,006
You guys hacking the German
database willy-nilly now?

327
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:51,006
I told Hans Richter that Israel
has had its own eye on Iosava

328
00:16:51,007 --> 00:16:56,006
and is just as fed up with CIA
entitlement issues as he is.

329
00:16:56,007 --> 00:16:58,006
And he just handed you these?

330
00:16:58,007 --> 00:16:59,370
He has a fondness for me.

331
00:16:59,371 --> 00:17:01,006
The guy is gayer than a picnic basket.

332
00:17:01,007 --> 00:17:02,006
You know that, right?

333
00:17:02,007 --> 00:17:05,046
Not in the '80s.

334
00:17:06,007 --> 00:17:08,006
I don't want to know.

335
00:17:08,007 --> 00:17:10,006
Thank you, Golda.

336
00:17:10,007 --> 00:17:13,006
I need you to bring me
something in return.

337
00:17:13,007 --> 00:17:17,006
I need the file from December 7, 2010,

338
00:17:17,007 --> 00:17:19,006
code name "Antoinette."

339
00:17:19,007 --> 00:17:21,006
You kidding me?
A woman's life is on the line,

340
00:17:21,007 --> 00:17:22,370
you're asking me
to steal you a fucking file?

341
00:17:22,371 --> 00:17:24,006
Bring it to me before noon today.

342
00:17:24,007 --> 00:17:26,512
Fuck that! No way. We're in
the middle of a crisis here!

343
00:17:26,537 --> 00:17:27,536
Jesus!

344
00:17:28,007 --> 00:17:31,006
Which just got better, thanks to us.

345
00:17:31,007 --> 00:17:33,099
Besides, a crisis means distraction.

346
00:17:34,007 --> 00:17:35,787
"Antoinette," Robert.

347
00:17:35,812 --> 00:17:37,727
Tel Aviv is counting on you.

348
00:17:55,662 --> 00:17:57,662
_

349
00:18:24,461 --> 00:18:25,855
_

350
00:18:26,007 --> 00:18:28,006
_

351
00:18:30,887 --> 00:18:32,887
_

352
00:18:38,007 --> 00:18:41,006
I haven't had a woman in a while.

353
00:18:41,007 --> 00:18:43,006
I don't want to fuck, just talk.

354
00:18:43,007 --> 00:18:44,006
I don't get paid to talk.

355
00:18:44,007 --> 00:18:46,006
You get paid to do
whatever gives me pleasure,

356
00:18:46,007 --> 00:18:48,006
isn't that right?

357
00:18:48,007 --> 00:18:50,006
Okay.

358
00:18:50,007 --> 00:18:53,243
So what exactly
do you want to talk about?

359
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:55,006
Zoltan Vasile.

360
00:18:57,007 --> 00:19:00,007
He's a pig. What do you want with him?

361
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:03,184
Fuck.

362
00:19:04,007 --> 00:19:05,107
You're a cop?

363
00:19:06,007 --> 00:19:09,006
Sex work is legal in Germany, bitch.

364
00:19:09,007 --> 00:19:11,006
You can't squeeze me for information.

365
00:19:11,007 --> 00:19:12,006
I haven't done anything wrong!

366
00:19:12,007 --> 00:19:14,006
No, but Zoltan has.

367
00:19:14,007 --> 00:19:15,006
He runs the black market from Bucharest,

368
00:19:15,007 --> 00:19:19,006
which means new underage pussy
every few months.

369
00:19:19,007 --> 00:19:21,006
Put you out of business.

370
00:19:21,007 --> 00:19:24,006
What do you want?

371
00:19:24,007 --> 00:19:26,007
An introduction.

372
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:47,855
Bora?

373
00:19:53,007 --> 00:19:55,245
I told you it was crazy.

374
00:19:56,007 --> 00:19:57,566
You didn't listen.

375
00:19:58,523 --> 00:20:00,073
I'm a terrible actor.

376
00:20:03,799 --> 00:20:05,919
It wasn't your fault. It was ours.

377
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:09,281
What happened to the girl?

378
00:20:10,007 --> 00:20:12,006
- Clare?
- We have reason to believe

379
00:20:12,007 --> 00:20:14,459
that she's being held captive
in Wedding.

380
00:20:15,313 --> 00:20:18,006
And Wedding, as you know,
is run by the Tuerk Federasyon.

381
00:20:18,007 --> 00:20:22,006
You know as much as I do.
Congratulations.

382
00:20:22,007 --> 00:20:23,657
That's not true.

383
00:20:24,906 --> 00:20:27,905
You are the pillar
of the Turk ex-pat community.

384
00:20:28,225 --> 00:20:30,006
You have connections high and low,

385
00:20:30,007 --> 00:20:32,006
and if Ruth Iosava wanted to find

386
00:20:32,007 --> 00:20:34,006
a quiet jihadi hideaway in Wedding...

387
00:20:35,007 --> 00:20:37,006
she'd have to run it by someone.

388
00:20:37,007 --> 00:20:39,006
A hole in my shoulder,

389
00:20:39,007 --> 00:20:40,898
and you come asking for more?

390
00:20:41,492 --> 00:20:43,492
Where does it end?

391
00:20:52,616 --> 00:20:54,006
Where the hell you been?

392
00:20:54,007 --> 00:20:57,007
Deep inside the wires
of our German friends.

393
00:21:00,271 --> 00:21:01,678
Where'd you get these?

394
00:21:01,703 --> 00:21:03,702
We all have our networks, Steven.

395
00:21:04,007 --> 00:21:06,006
- Pretty good, right?
- Yeah.

396
00:21:06,007 --> 00:21:08,600
It's eight hours ago.
We'll make it work.

397
00:21:11,649 --> 00:21:13,266
- She's on.
- Patch it in.

398
00:21:18,007 --> 00:21:21,006
- Hello, Frau Iosava.
- You have something to show me?

399
00:21:21,007 --> 00:21:22,610
I do, and I take it you have the same.

400
00:21:22,635 --> 00:21:23,863
You first.

401
00:21:25,007 --> 00:21:26,232
Uh, Frau Iosava...

402
00:21:26,233 --> 00:21:28,469
Paul, you first, or I hang up.

403
00:21:41,007 --> 00:21:42,341
That's all?

404
00:21:43,007 --> 00:21:45,006
Look.

405
00:21:45,007 --> 00:21:46,748
That's everything I can provide
at this time.

406
00:21:46,749 --> 00:21:49,006
You said proof of life.
Those were taken hours ago.

407
00:21:49,007 --> 00:21:50,732
No, no, I promise you,
I'm doing everything that I can.

408
00:21:50,733 --> 00:21:52,333
- Where's Aleksandre?
- Frau Iosava...

409
00:21:52,334 --> 00:21:54,007
Where is he?!

410
00:22:04,007 --> 00:22:07,007
I'm gonna level with you, okay?

411
00:22:09,007 --> 00:22:11,006
I don't know
how your husband was grabbed

412
00:22:11,007 --> 00:22:13,283
off the street like that. I...

413
00:22:13,746 --> 00:22:15,745
I don't know.

414
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:18,769
Now, was I attempting
in a more legal means

415
00:22:18,794 --> 00:22:19,948
to have him arrested? Yeah, I was.

416
00:22:19,983 --> 00:22:21,982
But somebody did take him,

417
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:25,006
and I've been doing
everything I can in my power

418
00:22:25,007 --> 00:22:26,006
to get him back.

419
00:22:26,007 --> 00:22:28,708
Now, there's reason to believe

420
00:22:28,733 --> 00:22:30,732
that he's being transported by car

421
00:22:31,007 --> 00:22:32,522
- to Romania.
- Romania?

422
00:22:32,523 --> 00:22:36,006
Now, if... if I had him
here in Berlin under my watch,

423
00:22:36,007 --> 00:22:39,006
I'd make the exchange myself.
But I don't. I don't.

424
00:22:39,007 --> 00:22:40,710
But those who do have him

425
00:22:40,711 --> 00:22:43,006
aren't acting in my interests
any more than yours.

426
00:22:43,007 --> 00:22:46,006
And so you and I, we have
to work together on this.

427
00:22:46,007 --> 00:22:50,006
Now, I have given you everything
that I can at this juncture.

428
00:22:50,007 --> 00:22:51,949
I have. And you...

429
00:22:53,007 --> 00:22:55,007
You just... You have to trust me.

430
00:22:58,007 --> 00:23:00,204
But I need you

431
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,639
to give me something in return.

432
00:23:02,833 --> 00:23:04,162
Trust you?

433
00:23:05,007 --> 00:23:08,007
You make a deal and expect me
to honor it after you don't?

434
00:23:15,007 --> 00:23:17,238
This is proof of life, Paul.

435
00:23:19,007 --> 00:23:22,230
So, please don't insult me and
embarrass yourself any further.

436
00:23:23,007 --> 00:23:25,006
I want to speak to Aleksandre.

437
00:23:25,007 --> 00:23:28,006
You will have him on the line
when I call back in an hour.

438
00:23:28,007 --> 00:23:30,097
In return, you may speak to your spy.

439
00:23:31,342 --> 00:23:34,006
But, please, don't test my
patience again. It has a limit.

440
00:23:34,007 --> 00:23:36,823
And you don't want to reach that point.

441
00:23:36,848 --> 00:23:37,848
Trust me.

442
00:23:41,007 --> 00:23:43,721
Look. She's alive.

443
00:23:43,746 --> 00:23:45,745
That's something, okay?

444
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:49,007
We just have to keep
moving forward, Steven.

445
00:24:39,007 --> 00:24:41,515
You're sure you want to get
that close to him?

446
00:24:41,576 --> 00:24:43,575
His body spray smells like cat piss.

447
00:24:43,576 --> 00:24:45,576
Let's get it over with.

448
00:24:47,576 --> 00:24:49,223
Zoltan?

449
00:24:49,576 --> 00:24:51,575
I've got a new friend

450
00:24:51,576 --> 00:24:54,575
who would like to meet you.

451
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:57,575
And who might this be?

452
00:24:57,576 --> 00:24:59,569
Bambi.

453
00:25:00,576 --> 00:25:02,575
Keep the boots on.

454
00:25:02,576 --> 00:25:03,576
The boots are hot.

455
00:25:09,576 --> 00:25:10,575
Crystal thinks I like you.

456
00:25:10,576 --> 00:25:12,575
You prefer a drink first?

457
00:25:12,576 --> 00:25:15,575
Maybe a line or two, huh?

458
00:25:15,576 --> 00:25:20,575
Well, I prefer you tell me what
happened to Aleksandre Iosava.

459
00:25:20,576 --> 00:25:21,575
Are you fucking with me?

460
00:25:23,576 --> 00:25:26,575
What did you say about Iosava?

461
00:25:26,576 --> 00:25:27,575
Huh? Who told you that?

462
00:25:27,576 --> 00:25:30,575
- Told me what?
- That we picked him up.

463
00:25:30,576 --> 00:25:32,575
You just did.

464
00:25:32,576 --> 00:25:34,575
Considering the backup
and the wire that I'm wearing,

465
00:25:34,576 --> 00:25:37,575
you can tell me
who hired you to kidnap Iosava

466
00:25:37,576 --> 00:25:39,575
or you can chose to keep your
mouth shut, and I'll make sure

467
00:25:39,576 --> 00:25:41,575
you'll be eating and shitting
from the same bowl

468
00:25:41,576 --> 00:25:44,576
for the next 5 to 10 years.

469
00:26:06,576 --> 00:26:08,575
I've made a simple offer.

470
00:26:08,576 --> 00:26:12,576
They get you back
if I get my husband back.

471
00:26:14,576 --> 00:26:15,575
"They"?

472
00:26:15,576 --> 00:26:17,890
Ah, she speaks.

473
00:26:18,576 --> 00:26:20,218
Just answer me this.

474
00:26:21,576 --> 00:26:24,575
Are you even a Muslim, or was that, too,

475
00:26:24,576 --> 00:26:26,575
part of the act?

476
00:26:26,576 --> 00:26:27,802
I am.

477
00:26:29,162 --> 00:26:31,575
I believe you, and yet I find myself

478
00:26:31,576 --> 00:26:35,575
even more disappointed
than if you were a kafir.

479
00:26:35,576 --> 00:26:36,917
Why is that?

480
00:26:36,918 --> 00:26:40,575
They can be tolerated
in their ignorance. But you?

481
00:26:40,854 --> 00:26:44,086
You reject the Prophet and still
call yourself a believer?

482
00:26:45,114 --> 00:26:46,575
I happen not to see it that way.

483
00:26:46,576 --> 00:26:47,973
Of course not.

484
00:26:47,998 --> 00:26:50,378
You see it whichever way suits you best,

485
00:26:50,379 --> 00:26:52,575
whichever path is most convenient.

486
00:26:53,401 --> 00:26:56,575
The drive-thru mentality of the West.

487
00:26:56,576 --> 00:26:58,575
Everything easy, within arm's reach.

488
00:26:58,576 --> 00:27:02,528
And instead of rejecting that,
you embrace this disposable God.

489
00:27:03,871 --> 00:27:05,575
That was my error.

490
00:27:06,254 --> 00:27:09,308
I do not speak from judgment
but experience.

491
00:27:10,576 --> 00:27:12,559
I was like you once.

492
00:27:13,895 --> 00:27:15,575
Then you saw the light?

493
00:27:15,576 --> 00:27:19,416
And you thought,
"Allah wants us to suffer"?

494
00:27:20,576 --> 00:27:23,575
You are already suffering, my dear.

495
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:26,575
The system you live in is sick.

496
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,054
Why do you think more
and more girls come to me,

497
00:27:29,079 --> 00:27:30,575
wanting to join the caliphate?

498
00:27:30,576 --> 00:27:32,575
Because they're young
and impressionable.

499
00:27:32,576 --> 00:27:35,575
Because they have rejected
the West's attempts

500
00:27:35,576 --> 00:27:40,429
to brainwash them into a life
of endless consumerism.

501
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:44,747
You can shovel the sand of an
entire desert into a bucket,

502
00:27:44,748 --> 00:27:47,192
but if it has no bottom,
the bucket remains empty.

503
00:27:47,193 --> 00:27:49,060
Trade the bucket for a bomb

504
00:27:49,061 --> 00:27:51,575
and your life for violent jihad.

505
00:27:51,576 --> 00:27:54,575
Your bombs kill more in a day
than we do in a year.

506
00:27:55,223 --> 00:27:56,730
And you know that.

507
00:27:57,755 --> 00:28:00,056
So what are we gonna do to stop it?

508
00:28:01,899 --> 00:28:03,576
I'll start.

509
00:28:06,019 --> 00:28:07,890
My name is Clare.

510
00:28:10,576 --> 00:28:12,602
Wouldn't that be convenient...

511
00:28:15,018 --> 00:28:16,576
Clare?

512
00:28:30,469 --> 00:28:32,469
_

513
00:28:32,645 --> 00:28:35,764
_

514
00:28:35,865 --> 00:28:36,954
_

515
00:28:37,041 --> 00:28:39,375
_

516
00:28:51,576 --> 00:28:53,575
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

517
00:28:53,576 --> 00:28:55,108
They're almost back on in the SCIF.

518
00:28:55,109 --> 00:28:56,494
Right. Thanks.

519
00:28:56,495 --> 00:28:58,011
Is there something else
I can help you find?

520
00:28:58,012 --> 00:28:59,575
No, no, no, I'm good. Thanks, Sandra.

521
00:28:59,576 --> 00:29:01,576
Don't forget to sign it out.

522
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:05,695
Gentlemen.

523
00:29:06,983 --> 00:29:09,316
Is this you being a friend
or a maverick or both?

524
00:29:09,317 --> 00:29:11,576
Just here to find out
what the hell the Brown Bear is.

525
00:29:19,576 --> 00:29:21,575
I, uh... I know it's early.

526
00:29:21,576 --> 00:29:23,575
Thank you so much for doing this.

527
00:29:23,576 --> 00:29:25,575
Of course.

528
00:29:26,335 --> 00:29:28,138
- Come in.
- Danke.

529
00:29:31,576 --> 00:29:33,575
Metin Burakgazi.

530
00:29:33,576 --> 00:29:35,244
He should know
where Clare is being held.

531
00:29:35,245 --> 00:29:37,264
According to SwingSet,
he's the go-to capo

532
00:29:37,265 --> 00:29:39,470
for anybody wanting to do
business in Wedding

533
00:29:39,471 --> 00:29:41,576
without leaving a paper trail.

534
00:29:42,576 --> 00:29:45,112
He's just anti-Western enough

535
00:29:45,113 --> 00:29:47,005
to win over the trust of the Iosavas.

536
00:29:47,006 --> 00:29:48,575
Thanks, Aalia.

537
00:29:48,576 --> 00:29:50,575
But with a capitalist heart.

538
00:29:50,576 --> 00:29:52,575
Have an address?

539
00:29:52,576 --> 00:29:55,575
Glasgowstrasse 97,
just off Schillerpark.

540
00:29:55,576 --> 00:29:57,575
So this is Brown Bear.

541
00:29:57,576 --> 00:29:58,809
Thanks, Val.

542
00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:00,302
Encrypted phones only, guys, yeah?

543
00:30:00,303 --> 00:30:01,902
I take it these weapons are untraceable?

544
00:30:02,349 --> 00:30:03,513
Of course.

545
00:30:04,576 --> 00:30:05,575
Hey.

546
00:31:24,067 --> 00:31:26,067
_

547
00:31:27,007 --> 00:31:28,385
_

548
00:31:28,547 --> 00:31:29,599
_

549
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:30,573
_

550
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:32,352
_

551
00:31:32,486 --> 00:31:33,945
_

552
00:32:27,852 --> 00:32:29,851
Please tell me you have some good news.

553
00:32:29,852 --> 00:32:32,851
Well, the Romanians have been
less than forthcoming so far,

554
00:32:32,852 --> 00:32:34,851
but we do have satellite confirmation

555
00:32:34,852 --> 00:32:36,851
that Iosava is not in Germany.

556
00:32:36,852 --> 00:32:39,640
He's being moved
to one of their compounds,

557
00:32:39,641 --> 00:32:41,851
Timisoara, near the Hungarian border.

558
00:32:41,852 --> 00:32:44,851
One of their compounds... Jesus Christ.

559
00:32:44,852 --> 00:32:47,075
This is a hostage negotiation.
I need leverage.

560
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,851
I don't need satellite pictures
in a file.

561
00:32:48,852 --> 00:32:51,851
I'm not the bad guy, Steven.

562
00:32:51,852 --> 00:32:53,851
The Romanians are asking
for more than million dollars

563
00:32:53,852 --> 00:32:56,851
just to get us a live feed of Iosava.

564
00:32:56,852 --> 00:32:59,851
I'm working my way up to an exchange,

565
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:01,492
but we need POTUS on board.

566
00:33:01,493 --> 00:33:05,851
Uh, look, we are counting on you
to deliver, Clay.

567
00:33:05,852 --> 00:33:08,369
- How soon?
- The feed is being set up now.

568
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:10,183
The Romanians are having
technical difficulties.

569
00:33:10,184 --> 00:33:12,851
My people are on it.

570
00:33:12,852 --> 00:33:14,852
That's all for now.

571
00:33:16,852 --> 00:33:19,851
Well, isn't this just
one big clusterfuck?

572
00:33:20,852 --> 00:33:23,974
What are you going to do without Iosava?

573
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:26,851
- She's on.
- Yeah.

574
00:33:26,852 --> 00:33:28,364
Put her through.

575
00:33:33,852 --> 00:33:34,851
Hello, Paul.

576
00:33:34,852 --> 00:33:36,951
This time, you go first.

577
00:33:37,578 --> 00:33:39,150
Put her on.

578
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:40,851
You lied to me earlier.

579
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:42,851
I think it's only fair
if you make up for that.

580
00:33:42,852 --> 00:33:45,852
Listen, you do not run
this negotiation. I do.

581
00:33:48,852 --> 00:33:50,852
You have one minute.

582
00:33:57,852 --> 00:33:59,491
How are you?

583
00:34:00,764 --> 00:34:01,763
Been better.

584
00:34:02,294 --> 00:34:04,003
Okay, we're working to...

585
00:34:04,724 --> 00:34:05,723
get you home.

586
00:34:05,852 --> 00:34:07,851
Frau Iosava has been very patient.

587
00:34:07,852 --> 00:34:10,851
Tell my fiancé I'm sorry
I lost the wedding ring.

588
00:34:10,852 --> 00:34:12,851
Frau Iosava's patience is running out.

589
00:34:12,852 --> 00:34:14,851
I want to speak to Aleksandre.

590
00:34:14,852 --> 00:34:15,851
They said in an hour.

591
00:34:15,852 --> 00:34:17,246
No!

592
00:34:17,751 --> 00:34:18,750
Hey.

593
00:34:23,852 --> 00:34:25,851
No! Stop!

594
00:34:25,852 --> 00:34:28,851
Steven, do something.

595
00:34:28,852 --> 00:34:30,851
Steven, is it?

596
00:34:30,852 --> 00:34:31,851
You want to see more?

597
00:34:31,852 --> 00:34:34,851
Your choice. And your last hour.

598
00:34:34,852 --> 00:34:36,851
Have my husband on the line
in exactly 60 minutes

599
00:34:36,852 --> 00:34:39,340
or Clare here dies.

600
00:34:48,852 --> 00:34:50,504
She's alive.

601
00:34:50,852 --> 00:34:52,851
But it just took a turn for the worse.

602
00:34:52,852 --> 00:34:54,696
How so?

603
00:34:55,544 --> 00:34:57,410
Just go get her back.

604
00:34:58,852 --> 00:35:00,851
Clare confirmed Wedding,
so you're on the right track.

605
00:35:00,852 --> 00:35:02,851
We're about to make contact
with the Turk.

606
00:35:02,852 --> 00:35:05,851
You have exactly 50 minutes.

607
00:35:05,852 --> 00:35:07,851
This shouldn't take long.

608
00:35:07,852 --> 00:35:10,852
- What did she say?
- Get this shit done.

609
00:35:25,852 --> 00:35:27,852
I'll find Metin.

610
00:35:57,930 --> 00:35:59,810
_

611
00:35:59,852 --> 00:36:01,129
Your worst nightmare

612
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:03,851
if you don't tell me
where Ruth Iosava is.

613
00:36:03,852 --> 00:36:04,851
Who?

614
00:36:04,852 --> 00:36:07,851
Take the girl.
If I'm not out in three minutes,

615
00:36:07,852 --> 00:36:10,851
shoot her in the fucking head.

616
00:36:24,852 --> 00:36:27,852
Okay, Metin, let's chat.

617
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:34,956
Now, this...

618
00:36:36,143 --> 00:36:38,732
This is how a real man shaves.

619
00:36:40,638 --> 00:36:42,851
None of your five fucking safety blades

620
00:36:42,852 --> 00:36:44,764
and a moisture strip.

621
00:36:51,852 --> 00:36:54,057
I don't know Ruth Iosava.

622
00:36:54,852 --> 00:36:56,032
Yes, you do.

623
00:36:56,852 --> 00:36:58,991
I can see it in your eyes.

624
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:02,176
I was trained for that, you know.

625
00:37:11,306 --> 00:37:14,004
Hurt a man the first time,
and you feel it.

626
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:17,851
Then you get up the next day,
and the sun is still shining,

627
00:37:17,852 --> 00:37:20,006
and they tell you to do it again.

628
00:37:21,098 --> 00:37:24,250
You hurt a man a second time,
and you excuse it.

629
00:37:24,852 --> 00:37:28,161
And then you justify it,
and then you exploit it.

630
00:37:29,852 --> 00:37:31,531
You get curious.

631
00:37:32,852 --> 00:37:35,851
You start to wonder
how far you'll have to take it

632
00:37:35,852 --> 00:37:38,306
to get the information you need.

633
00:37:38,981 --> 00:37:41,139
Will it take a finger?

634
00:37:42,852 --> 00:37:45,075
Will it take two ears?

635
00:37:49,636 --> 00:37:51,851
Where's Ruth Iosava, Metin?

636
00:37:54,852 --> 00:37:57,851
Okay.

637
00:38:06,852 --> 00:38:10,851
What the hell were you doing in there?

638
00:38:10,852 --> 00:38:12,852
Getting an address.

639
00:38:28,698 --> 00:38:29,756
Come on.

640
00:38:35,852 --> 00:38:38,197
So how are we doing
in the prisoner exchange?

641
00:38:38,198 --> 00:38:39,851
The audio feed is ready.

642
00:38:39,852 --> 00:38:41,386
And the exchange?

643
00:38:41,411 --> 00:38:42,851
We're still waiting on POTUS.

644
00:38:42,852 --> 00:38:44,851
Well, where the fuck is he?

645
00:38:44,852 --> 00:38:46,912
Let's get Ruth on the line.

646
00:38:47,852 --> 00:38:49,851
Well, Langley's no help.

647
00:38:49,852 --> 00:38:53,907
Oh, you think? Sending us
into a duel with a cap gun.

648
00:38:54,852 --> 00:38:56,166
Hello, Steven.

649
00:38:56,852 --> 00:38:58,851
Aleksandre's on the line, as promised.

650
00:38:58,852 --> 00:38:59,851
You have two minutes.

651
00:38:59,852 --> 00:39:02,851
Then we continue with the negotiation.

652
00:39:02,852 --> 00:39:04,588
Where's Clare?

653
00:39:07,852 --> 00:39:09,852
Put on Aleksandre.

654
00:39:13,539 --> 00:39:14,866
_

655
00:39:14,899 --> 00:39:16,146
_

656
00:39:16,892 --> 00:39:18,078
_

657
00:39:18,512 --> 00:39:19,908
_

658
00:39:20,389 --> 00:39:22,689
_

659
00:39:23,273 --> 00:39:25,273
_

660
00:39:26,298 --> 00:39:27,720
_

661
00:39:27,794 --> 00:39:31,678
_

662
00:39:32,329 --> 00:39:35,999
_

663
00:39:36,202 --> 00:39:37,576
_

664
00:39:37,738 --> 00:39:38,737
Where did you take him?

665
00:39:44,852 --> 00:39:46,483
Aleksandre...

666
00:39:46,503 --> 00:39:49,799
_

667
00:39:49,852 --> 00:39:52,538
- But maybe they lied.
- No. No.

668
00:39:52,565 --> 00:39:53,565
No.

669
00:39:53,612 --> 00:39:58,177
_

670
00:39:59,385 --> 00:40:02,214
_

671
00:40:02,852 --> 00:40:04,851
- They lied to us.
- No, no.

672
00:40:04,852 --> 00:40:07,351
It's not true.
It's not true, Frau Iosava.

673
00:40:07,404 --> 00:40:09,404
_

674
00:40:10,191 --> 00:40:11,653
_

675
00:40:11,852 --> 00:40:13,277
Cut the feed.

676
00:40:13,511 --> 00:40:14,827
_

677
00:40:14,852 --> 00:40:16,851
Cut the damn feed!

678
00:40:18,852 --> 00:40:20,621
Listen to me. Do not do thi...

679
00:40:20,646 --> 00:40:21,646
There's a way out of this.

680
00:40:21,675 --> 00:40:23,675
_

681
00:40:24,852 --> 00:40:25,851
We had a deal, Steven.

682
00:40:25,852 --> 00:40:27,265
- Oh, no.
- Now we don't!

683
00:40:27,266 --> 00:40:28,851
There was never going to be an exchange.

684
00:40:28,852 --> 00:40:30,851
You know it as well as I do.

685
00:40:30,852 --> 00:40:33,851
Aleksandre
Iosava for this disposable thing,

686
00:40:33,852 --> 00:40:35,851
- this hypocrite!
- There is no God but God.

687
00:40:35,852 --> 00:40:37,393
Shut up!

688
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:38,851
All of you.

689
00:40:50,852 --> 00:40:52,419
Listen, there's still a way out of here.

690
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:54,103
- There is a way...
- No, there isn't.

691
00:40:54,104 --> 00:40:56,851
There's a way out,
but if you pull the trigger...

692
00:41:07,852 --> 00:41:09,852
Let her go.

693
00:41:14,852 --> 00:41:17,169
There's SWAT team
outside. There's no officers.

694
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:18,563
It's just me and him.

695
00:41:20,852 --> 00:41:22,411
If you put the gun down...

696
00:41:23,545 --> 00:41:24,674
and let her go...

697
00:41:26,127 --> 00:41:27,851
you can still get out of here alive.

698
00:41:27,852 --> 00:41:29,257
I love you, Clare. I love you.

699
00:41:29,258 --> 00:41:32,216
My freedom comes from
you people? I don't think so.

700
00:41:32,217 --> 00:41:35,851
Just shoot this cunt already, will you?

701
00:41:36,852 --> 00:41:38,851
Oh, fuck! Down!

702
00:41:38,852 --> 00:41:40,459
On the fucking floor!

703
00:41:40,484 --> 00:41:41,483
- Get down!
- Jesus.

704
00:41:42,852 --> 00:41:45,851
Clare, no, no, no, no, no. No.

705
00:41:45,852 --> 00:41:47,851
- No, baby. No, baby.
- Hector.

706
00:41:47,852 --> 00:41:49,348
Shh.

707
00:41:49,852 --> 00:41:51,851
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

708
00:41:51,852 --> 00:41:53,593
No, no, no.

709
00:41:53,618 --> 00:41:55,617
No, no, no, no.

710
00:41:55,852 --> 00:41:56,967
No.

711
00:41:57,852 --> 00:42:00,852
No, no, no, no, no.

712
00:42:34,705 --> 00:42:36,219
What are you doing?

713
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:48,852
You sure you picked
the right celestial pony, lady?

714
00:42:52,181 --> 00:42:54,851
I sure as hell wouldn't bet
on paradise right now

715
00:42:54,852 --> 00:42:56,470
if I were you.

716
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:01,577
Hector.

717
00:43:02,122 --> 00:43:03,864
Hector, you're better than this.

718
00:43:18,852 --> 00:43:20,852
No, I'm not.

719
00:43:23,852 --> 00:43:29,852
I'm the worst this fucked-up
agency has to offer.

720
00:44:06,852 --> 00:44:07,851
Yes?

721
00:44:07,852 --> 00:44:10,852
Valerie? It's Daniel.

722
00:44:15,128 --> 00:44:16,851
Where are you?

723
00:44:16,852 --> 00:44:18,271
We're in the warehouse.

724
00:44:18,558 --> 00:44:20,557
What happened?

725
00:44:20,852 --> 00:44:21,851
Ruth got away.

726
00:44:22,243 --> 00:44:23,852
Oh, Jesus.

727
00:44:26,585 --> 00:44:27,598
Where's Clare?

728
00:44:29,852 --> 00:44:32,852
Valerie... I am so sorry.

729
00:44:36,852 --> 00:44:39,160
Listen, we need an anonymous tip
called in

730
00:44:39,161 --> 00:44:40,851
so that Clare can be found.

731
00:44:40,852 --> 00:44:42,851
If word gets out
that Hector and I were here,

732
00:44:42,852 --> 00:44:44,851
we'll be on the next plane
back to headquarters

733
00:44:44,852 --> 00:44:46,417
before Clare's in the ground.

734
00:44:54,852 --> 00:44:56,852
I'll have it arranged.

735
00:45:23,852 --> 00:45:26,123
Steven, Hans is on line two.

736
00:45:28,331 --> 00:45:30,484
Excuse me, please.

737
00:45:30,571 --> 00:45:31,570
Thank you.

738
00:45:34,852 --> 00:45:35,851
Hans.

739
00:45:35,852 --> 00:45:37,851
I'll keep this brief.

740
00:45:37,852 --> 00:45:39,851
I know the Americans renditioned Iosava.

741
00:45:40,494 --> 00:45:42,851
For the sake of your family,
if not our friendship,

742
00:45:42,852 --> 00:45:45,851
I'm warning you to brace
yourself for the consequences.

743
00:45:45,852 --> 00:45:48,650
Hans, wait. Langley's not
playing straight with me.

744
00:45:48,676 --> 00:45:49,851
The story is breaking now.

745
00:45:49,852 --> 00:45:53,851
Did...

746
00:45:53,852 --> 00:45:56,851
<i>No rest for the infamous Thomas Shaw</i>

747
00:45:56,852 --> 00:45:59,851
<i>this evening, and no mercy for the CIA.</i>

748
00:45:59,852 --> 00:46:01,459
<i>A new leak has named Steven Frost</i>

749
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:03,851
<i>as chief of the CIA station in Berlin</i>

750
00:46:03,852 --> 00:46:07,851
<i>and the man behind the illegal
rendition of Aleksandre Iosava.</i>

751
00:46:07,852 --> 00:46:11,851
<i>Iosava, a German citizen
and alleged Georgian terrorist</i>

752
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:15,121
<i>was plucked off the streets of
the German capital last night.</i>

753
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:17,270
<i>If there's one secret</i>

754
00:46:17,271 --> 00:46:19,851
<i>that does seem to be able
to remain safe these days,</i>

755
00:46:19,852 --> 00:46:22,851
<i>it is the identity of Thomas Shaw.</i>

756
00:46:23,685 --> 00:46:24,851
<i>For more on this breaking news,</i>

757
00:46:24,852 --> 00:46:26,851
<i>let's cut to a press
conference. Here's a statement</i>

758
00:46:26,852 --> 00:46:28,851
<i>made by Krischan Ganz,
head of German Intelligence,</i>

759
00:46:28,852 --> 00:46:31,852
<i>just a few minutes ago in Cologne.</i>

760
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:34,303
_

761
00:46:34,946 --> 00:46:40,012
_

762
00:46:40,925 --> 00:46:44,330
_

763
00:46:44,330 --> 00:46:47,199
_

764
00:46:48,291 --> 00:46:51,317
_

765
00:47:04,852 --> 00:47:06,851
You and me joined at the hip again...

766
00:47:06,852 --> 00:47:08,851
That's either fate
or a cosmically bad idea.

767
00:47:08,852 --> 00:47:11,749
With you, Hector,
it's one and the same thing.

768
00:47:12,852 --> 00:47:14,851
Where'd they post you after Chechnya?

769
00:47:14,852 --> 00:47:15,989
Hell.

770
00:47:16,852 --> 00:47:18,725
They sent me to hell.

771
00:47:20,852 --> 00:47:23,851
Hurt a man the first time,
and you feel it.

772
00:47:23,852 --> 00:47:26,851
You hurt a man a second time,
and you excuse it.

773
00:47:26,852 --> 00:47:30,851
And then you justify it,
and then you exploit it.

774
00:47:35,852 --> 00:47:38,851
Daniel, you're a company man.
There's no harm in that.

775
00:47:38,852 --> 00:47:41,851
So was I once. But tonight,
you're in bad company.

776
00:47:41,852 --> 00:47:46,851
I'm the worst this fucked-up
agency has to offer.
