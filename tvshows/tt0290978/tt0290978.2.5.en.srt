2
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,279
All right?
Just another normal day at the office.

3
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,516
Just a normal day, innit?

4
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,553
What? What are you laughing at?

5
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,676
He's mad. Obviously, red nose day.

6
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:47,158
It's always a good laugh.
Keith? This is the sort of thing...

7
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,160
ali g? Ali keith!

8
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,911
Gareth, come here. Normal day,
normal office. What are you doing?

9
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:01,271
I'm going to hop everywhere. I'm sponsored.

10
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:04,631
That's the sort of thing we'll be doing today.

11
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:08,150
We raised quite a lot last time, didn't we?

12
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:13,832
It is comic relief and we're raising money
for people who are starving to death.

13
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:20,633
If I make people laugh
while I'm saving lives, sue me, but...

14
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,273
do it.

15
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,192
Boyakasha.

16
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:31,111
That's an accountant and that's
the boss encouraging it! Is this normal?

17
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,710
I've got the "slough gazette" coming down.

18
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,354
- What time are they coming?
- Five-ish.

19
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,676
- They'll love us.
- It's just me.

20
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,996
- We can all be in it.
- Not really.

21
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,670
- They'll love us.
- Stop trying to worm into my photo.

22
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:01,117
Everyone's joining in.
This young lady... ooh, a bit saucy.

23
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,632
Selling kisses for the lads...
or any ladies who like that...

24
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:11,312
I don't think there are any here,
and if there are, good luck to them.

25
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,036
- It's different for girls. Lower risk.
- Erotic.

26
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:21,997
Well, not in this case.
I mean, it's not a sexual day. It's er...

27
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,352
- here's the man. Finchy!
- Brentmeister!

28
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,236
Kisses for a quid. It's a good cause.
Do you mind kissing me on the nose?

29
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,036
- No. Put your quid in.
- Ok. Kiss me on the nose!

30
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:40,199
What do I get for a tenner?
Squeal, piggy, squeal!

31
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:04,079
- No. I'm not that desperate.
- Who says famine has to be depressing?

32
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:21,911
Don't get me wrong. I've got
nothing against it, it's a good cause,

33
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:26,989
but I don't want to join in
with someone else's idea of wackiness.

34
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:33,469
If you see someone collecting for cancer
research because they've been affected by it

35
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:39,710
or an old bloke selling poppies,
there's a dignity about it - a quiet dignity.

36
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,480
No. Come on, guys, leave it.

37
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,433
Leave it. Please!

38
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:49,952
And that's what today's all about - dignity.

39
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,879
No! No!

40
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,071
Always dignity.

41
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:00,119
Bastard!
My wife and kids are gonna see those!

42
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:20,431
There's people watching going, "oi, brent!
Why are you bothering with comic relief?

43
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:26,078
"There's still people starving."
That's why I'm still doing it. You should too.

44
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:31,718
Probably put a number up there, shall we?
If people want to make donations.

45
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:37,597
I hear people go, "the money
just goes to hungry foreigners." not true.

46
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:42,396
A lot of it stays in this country
and goes to home-grown problems...

47
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:47,196
aka the disableds.
A lot of money goes to these fellas.

48
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,517
Not to you. You don't need it, you're working.

49
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:56,317
If you do claim for it, that's up to you,
as long as you don't abuse the system.

50
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,159
- A lot of them are.
- What do you mean?

51
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,157
People abuse the system.

52
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,158
- Ensure people who say they're crippled...
- disabled.

53
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,316
...actually are...
- disabled.

54
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:10,513
You think people pretend to be disabled
to claim money off the dss?

55
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,030
- I think there should be tests.
What tests?

56
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,674
Stick pins in their legs, see if they react.

57
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,077
I have feeling in my legs. I just can't walk.

58
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:24,398
- I'm just saying there should be tests.
- We're all ears.

59
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,195
I dunno. When they go down the dss
to make a claim,

60
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:33,520
they should set off a fake fire alarm
so everyone legs it, leaving them there.

61
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:39,431
If they're fake, they'll be running with you.
If not, they'll be screaming for help.

62
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:47,433
Then you come back in and say, "don't cry.
You've passed. Here's your money."

63
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:52,077
Spend it on one
of those little blue cars or whatever...

64
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,396
it's just one idea.

65
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,352
So...

66
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:01,156
she's joining in with it.
Do you want to put this nose on?

67
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,319
- No, I don't.
- It's up to you. Her own decisions.

68
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,789
Gareth, you know
I'm doing kisses for a pound too.

69
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,834
- I wouldn't pay you if you were.
- I'll put your pound in.

70
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:25,999
- So you can kiss me.
- I wouldn't kiss you if you paid me.

71
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:31,354
I am paying. It's quite simple.
As it's for charity, I need to just get...

72
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,791
- why are you such a bender?
- I'm just...

73
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,630
get off! I'm not kissing you.
You are such a pervert!

74
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,231
- It feels good, though.
- Get off! I hope you're getting all this.

75
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,876
I hope your girlfriend knows
or she'll get a big surprise.

76
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:54,474
Is that your big surprise?
I've found his big surprise. All right. Ok.

77
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,518
- Flipping heck.
- You take things too far.

78
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,235
All right. Don't get so het up about it.

79
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,713
Ha ha! Hoo! Hah!

80
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,957
That was one way. I didn't kiss him back.

81
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,236
He's funny. He's a funny bastard.

82
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:23,271
- Pass it back.
- You got it?

83
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,232
Yep. You got it.

84
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:31,791
Gather round, everybody.
We've got a surprise for you.

85
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:38,109
- Remember where we were in that game.
- Sheila? Nice costume. You look fantastic.

86
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:45,271
Please give a big warm welcome to the
fantastic neil godwin and the lovely rachel.

87
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,675
Ok. It's that time again.

88
00:07:54,120 --> 00:08:00,389
We've both suffered for our art here,
please suffer with us and give generously.

89
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,592
Thanks. Jennifer, could you do the honours?

90
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:17,753
# 0h, girl, I've known you very well
I've seen you growing every day

91
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:22,431
# I've never really looked before
but now you take my breath away

92
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:26,918
# suddenly you're in my life
a part of everything I do

93
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,557
# you got me working day and night
jiust trying to keep a hold on you

94
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:36,515
# here in your arms I found my paradise

95
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,757
# my only chance for happiness

96
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:44,839
# and if I lose you now I think I would die

97
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:49,591
# 0h, say you'll always be my baby
we can make it shine

98
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:56,831
# we can take forever
jiust a minute at a time

99
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,031
# more than a woman

100
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,832
# baby
more than a woman to me... #

101
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,909
# my baby moves at midnight

102
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,351
# goes right on till the dawn

103
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,594
# my woman takes me higher

104
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,996
# my woman keeps me warm

105
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,077
that looks gay.

106
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,670
# What you doin' on your back? Aah

107
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,031
# what you doin' on your back? Aah

108
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,869
# you should be dancing, yeah

109
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:39,637
# dancing, yeah... #

110
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,354
thank you very much.
You can add that to yours.

111
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:09,680
Cheers. I've already raised more than that.
Â£300 we did last time.

112
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:14,271
If you wanted dancing,
you should have come to me.

113
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,358
- Do you dance?
- Big time. Yeah.

114
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:23,510
More modern steps than that. I've fused
"flashdance" with mc hammer shit.

115
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:29,074
- All right. Show us your moves.
- No, there's no beat.

116
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:32,716
- Come on!
- He had music.

117
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:36,356
Well... just for charity, I'll do a little bit.

118
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,630
# Do do do-do do dah... #

119
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,197
- so... that's...
- great, david.

120
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,432
- Give me a bit of warning...
- we have to give a donation for that?

121
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:39,829
All the money collected is for both dances -
both excellent dances in their way.

122
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:45,876
Mine was impromptu, but I don't think
you should get extra points for that.

123
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:50,392
Make your own minds up.
Leave me out of it. It's for charity.

124
00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:01,432
You've seen me entertain and raise money.
Maybe I'd like to do that for a living.

125
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:06,316
Use my humour and my profile
to both help and amuse people.

126
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:12,038
And if it's ideas for tv shows -
game shows or whatever - I'm your man.

127
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,279
I'm exploring that avenue
with my management training,

128
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,994
but I'd like to do that on a global scale.

129
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:24,752
It's not, "look at me. I'm entertaining
whilst saving lives. Aren't I brilliant?"

130
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,633
It's going, "if you think I'm brilliant,

131
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:32,595
"help save these guys who are starving,
but are also brilliant."

132
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,270
Not as entertainers.
A lot of them can't speak english.

133
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,917
Don't give them a game show,
but save them from dying at least.

134
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,829
Then maybe they can
do something in their own country

135
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,874
on television
or whatever they have... the wireless.

136
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:52,914
Give them a job
on the world service or something.

137
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:09,837
We're from the local mental hospital.
Is gareth keenan here? He's escaped.

138
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,713
- He is mental.
- Here's my crew.

139
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,115
Kisses for a quid. Yes.

140
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:27,111
My mad mates. That's all we need.

141
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:42,953
- Sorry about this. My mad mates.
- Er... well...

142
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:47,995
- they finally came to take you away!
- Are you mad as well?

143
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,509
- Guilty!
- He's the boss.

144
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,713
- Give us a job.
- I've already got one reprobate.

145
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,514
Jimmy the perv and the oggmonster.

146
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:02,271
What's the weather like up there?
Your parents put you in a gro-bag?

147
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:07,270
- "Let's grow a lanky, goggle-eyed freak!"
- No need to get offensive.

148
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,994
- I didn't call you fatty.
- All right...

149
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:15,399
don't have a go at the eyes, because that's
astigmatism I've had from the age of five.

150
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,273
That's what makes them a bit bulbous.

151
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,076
- I didn't call you whale man.
- But I don't call myself the mong boy.

152
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:26,158
- The oggmonster.
- I'm not calling you that.

153
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,113
- That's my name.
- What's your real name?

154
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:33,552
- Nathan.
- It's a good name. I'll call you nathan.

155
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:50,100
I didn't call you fatty!
What's the matter with him?

156
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:55,718
I've got a sponsorship form for comic relief.
I wanted to enter into the spirit.

157
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,549
Gents, sorry to interrupt.
Would you sponsor me?

158
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:05,118
I have to hide as many of gareth's
possessions as I can from him.

159
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:08,790
- What?
- Hiding gareth's belongings.

160
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,232
- I'll give you Â£2 for the lot.
- That's a generous offer.

161
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,716
They're waiting for me.

162
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,268
Break it up. Put her down!

163
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:23,234
No, they wouldn't.
She wouldn't. Her husband's loaded.

164
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,396
He does ok.

165
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,116
Oh, dear.

166
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:35,268
- What a day! He's still...
- david, do you have that report?

167
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:41,315
- Glad you brought that up.
- That's why I'm here.

168
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:45,399
Yes. Um... formulating a lot of good ideas...

169
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,752
I don't want to talk about a report
we're going to do soon.

170
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:54,715
I want the report we talked about
four days ago that was due today.

171
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,877
You know how important this report is.

172
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:04,039
I discover that this is the fruit of your labours.

173
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:09,109
- Don't go through my stuff.
- Read the first sentence for jennifer.

174
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:18,879
"Imagine a cross between 'telly addicts'
and 'noel's house party'.

175
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:24,108
"You've just imagined 'upstairs downstairs',
devised and hosted by david brent."

176
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,834
David, I don't understand this.

177
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:32,912
- Contestants run upstairs and get a clue...
- not the game show!

178
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,112
I don't understand
why you haven't done the report,

179
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,869
or your consistent failure
to do what is asked of you.

180
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:44,392
You're viewing my methods
like there's something missing.

181
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:49,958
You're looking at the jigsaw that it is
through a keyhole when you should be...

182
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:55,716
- some words would be useful.
- Actions speak louder than words.

183
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,718
You're on a warning. That's my action.

184
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:03,152
Three strikes and you're out
and things have got to change.

185
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:11,114
Fine. Give me all three now, then,
because I'd love to see you run this place.

186
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:15,518
You'd have a mutiny on your hands,
but if that's what you want...

187
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:19,679
that's not what I want.
I want you doing your job.

188
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,917
- Take the verbal warning...
- still the warning?

189
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:28,114
...learn from it
and let's move onwards and upwards. Ok?

190
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:35,834
Neil makes me laugh, though.
It's his interfering. It's his timing.

191
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:39,396
Going on about some report. It's red nose day.

192
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:44,355
What's more important? You, neil,
with your report or starving children?

193
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:47,996
Oh, I don't know.
What would lenny henry say?

194
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,634
Imagine him going out on comic relief day

195
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:55,595
and dawn french is going,
"you haven't done the washing up."

196
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:59,793
"Do it yourself!
I've got to save some africans!"

197
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,359
- What are you reading?
- A holiday brochure.

198
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:11,313
Why is that, then? Going on holiday?

199
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,954
- Possibly.
- Where to?

200
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,912
The states.

201
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,677
- United states?
- Yeah.

202
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:32,552
Don't know if you've heard the gossip,
but tim's going out with rachel.

203
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:38,437
- Er... yeah. I'd heard.
- He used to fancy you, didn't he?

204
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,279
- Did he?
- Yeah, he did.

205
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:44,438
And now he's found someone better.

206
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,198
Yup.

207
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,876
- Seen my phone?
- Huh?

208
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,036
Where's my phone?

209
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,712
- Have you got...?
- No.

210
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,673
Where have you put my phone?

211
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,476
- I don't believe it!
- Gareth...

212
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:16,958
- I've told you not to touch my stuff.
- Listen...

213
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:21,312
- it's for charity.
- What else have you taken? My tiny tanks!

214
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,638
- How am I supposed to work?
- You'll have to hop to it.

215
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:34,869
- A lot of crime in america.
- Right. Well, I'll be careful.

216
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:40,712
Word of advice.
Keep your traveller's cheques in a bum-bag.

217
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,949
Thanks. I'll buy one.

218
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,354
- When you get there?
- Yup.

219
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:54,474
Word of warning, then.
Out there they call them fanny packs.

220
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:59,317
'Cause fanny means your arse over there...

221
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,953
...not your minge.

222
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,277
Where's...? God, you're so immature!

223
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:21,109
- I demand that...
- gareth's stopped hopping.

224
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,959
- How can I do any work?
- It's for charity.

225
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:27,118
- It's for you winding me up.
- He's stopped hopping.

226
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:31,598
I don't have to hop all day.
It's just when I'm moving.

227
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,870
- Where does it say that?
- See?

228
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:39,393
That's mine, for a start.
Where's the rest of it?

229
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:45,311
Gareth. Ok, gareth. Just calm down.
Have a seat. You've been on your foot all day.

230
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,239
God! How do you hide a chair?

231
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,198
- Dawny. Take that?
- Yeah.

232
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,550
You all right? All right?

233
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:10,470
There you go. Prawn and avocado.
See you later.

234
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:14,150
- You're not going to eat here?
- I've gotta get back.

235
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,396
I made Â£19 today.

236
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:20,832
Any of it going to english kids
or all going abroad?

237
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:25,158
Well... stop moaning
and give her a quid for a kiss.

238
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,591
- I'm not paying for it, mate.
- Them's the rules.

239
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,519
- All right.
- Thank you.

240
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:34,234
There you go. Come here, you.

241
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,349
Good. That's great.

242
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,557
- See ya.
- See ya.

243
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:50,119
Right. Oh... my contribution.

244
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,551
Thank you. Where do you want
your kiss? Your kiss?

245
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:57,070
- It's all right.
- You've got to have a kiss.

246
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,236
It's the rules.

247
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,354
- What you doing?
- Just working.

248
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:41,795
I'm very, very, very bored.

249
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,959
Excuse me. Desk procedures.
Chairs are for sitting on.

250
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:49,630
He's jealous
he's not getting the view you're getting.

251
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,229
Wrong. I got the arse this side.

252
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:57,514
I'd only want to be there if you had on
a skirt and I could look up there at it.

253
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,958
- Aren't you going to defend my honour?
- No.

254
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:06,870
- You'd better get off the table.
- He's embarrassed by his girlfriend!

255
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,559
I'm not.

256
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,551
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

257
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,556
We're cool.

258
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,676
- Today or tomorrow?
- Tomorrow lunchtime.

259
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,755
- Excuse me, david.
- Yes.

260
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:40,954
- Can we have another quick word?
- Not now. I'm running downstairs.

261
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:44,277
"The gazette" are coming in to take my picture.

262
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,837
I'm going to be in the paper.
Wernham-hogg are. Free advertising.

263
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,315
- This shouldn't take long.
- Ok.

264
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:56,548
Sorry to spring this on you. We've been
discussing something you said earlier -

265
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,911
it's something we've been thinking about too.

266
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:05,677
We'd like to offer you
a very generous redundancy package.

267
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,039
Are you offering it
or telling me I've got to take it?

268
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:20,954
- We're telling you to take it.
- We'll put in a proper meeting tomorrow.

269
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:29,518
That's good timing, isn't it?
Telling me that today. The day of laughter.

270
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,199
Brilliant.

271
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:35,750
That's that ruined. That's what I was...

272
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:49,194
it's got pockets and everything.

273
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:54,638
Now I'll try and go down and be funny.

274
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:59,550
That's going to be good, isn't it?

275
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,912
With that going through.

276
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:09,031
I knew you were planning something.

277
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:12,596
Jennifer, do you agree? Because we can...

278
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,754
I'll be all right. I've got other irons in the fire.

279
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:21,032
It's the best thing that's ever happened to me.

280
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:27,190
I'm going to love to see you telling that lot,
because you'll have a mutiny.

281
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,756
They will go berserk. Definitely.

282
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:35,389
If that's it, can you leave now, please?

283
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:41,948
I've got stuff to do. I've got laughter...
I've got money to raise. Mouths to feed.

284
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,276
- Thanks for your time.
- Yeah.

285
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:08,675
If you're wondering what that meeting
was just about in there...

286
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:13,236
that's it. I've been made redundant.

287
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,993
Yeah.

288
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:26,709
After it was me who saved others
from redundancy. And then it's back...

289
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:30,069
the good die young.

290
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:36,276
But um... yes... I said you lot are going mental.

291
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:42,717
Now I've got to go and give laughter.

292
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,358
But...

293
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,792
see ya.

294
