2
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,040
This is the worst part of my job, you know.

3
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,720
I do not want to lose a good man.

4
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,391
But it's out of my hands,

5
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,593
and if it were in my hands,
my hands are tied. It's nothing personal...

6
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,392
Why am I getting fired?

7
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,795
You're not getting fired. It's redundancy.

8
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,675
Cutbacks being what they are,
you are one of the unlucky ones.

9
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,030
Or one of the lucky ones in my opinion!

10
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:00,433
David, why, when there are
three other forklift operators,

11
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,074
do you decide to fire me and not Anton?

12
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,475
Is this positive discrimination?

13
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,875
Do you have disability quotas to fill?

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,831
I don't know what you mean.

15
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,474
Are you keeping Anton on because he's disabled?

16
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,955
- Anton's not disabled.
- He's a midget.

17
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:19,517
Yeah, but you're not disabled
if you're a midget. That's just small.

18
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,473
Ronnie Corbett doesn't get special treatment.

19
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,273
He's five foot. Anton's three foot four.

20
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:29,313
So are some children.
Children aren't disabled, are they?

21
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,431
Children don't work in warehouses.

22
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,235
Look, whether or not Anton
is indeed a midget or a dwarf...

23
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,591
- No, he's a midget.
- What's the difference?

24
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:43,433
A dwarf has
disproportionately short arms and legs.

25
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,676
Oh, I know the ones.

26
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,870
It's caused by a hormone deficiency.

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,877
Yeah. Bloody hormones.

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,754
A midget is still a dwarf,
but their arms and legs are in proportion.

29
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,029
So what's an elf?

30
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,798
Do you want to answer that?

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,514
An elf is a supernatural being.

32
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,438
Sometimes they're invisible, like fairies.

33
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,831
They don't actually exist, do they? In real life?

34
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,110
Do you think I enjoy this?
It's been imposed upon me.

35
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,515
"It's been imposed upon me!"

36
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,108
Yeah. What do you want me to say, I'm sorry?

37
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,390
Yeah. I want you to say you're sorry.

38
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,556
Apologise and stop passing the buck!

39
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,434
I'm not passing the buck.
This is someone else's decision.

40
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,199
- Go above my head if you want.
- Oh, I will.

41
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:04,074
- Good luck. It's your prerogative.
- Yeah, it is. My prerogative.

42
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,397
- So is a pixie the same as an elf?
- Hold on, Gareth.

43
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,876
I just want to know
how he knows so much about midgets.

44
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,396
It's called an education.

45
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,997
- So what's a goblin?
- How long will you be?

46
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,112
I know I probably seem an imposing figure now -

47
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,674
you know, the slick boss -

48
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,553
but get to know me, you'll see I'm mad.

49
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,557
I brought that in.

50
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,954
So...

51
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,231
Oh, here we go.

52
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,313
Malcolm.

53
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,069
This is Malcolm.
This is Karen Roper, my new secretary.

54
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,715
You can all use her -
as the actress said to the bishop.

55
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,036
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

56
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:02,994
David, can I just ask why
you've hired yourself a new secretary

57
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,078
when you're having to fire people like Alex?

58
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,270
Different people, different jobs.

59
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,793
To whit, the answer to the question,
is it people or task

60
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,876
is - well, you know - people.

61
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,676
Like this person. Kojak.

62
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,837
- David, what I want to know...
- Kojak we call him.

63
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,677
...am I going to be fired? When will we know?

64
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,590
Good question. Jennifer is coming in
midday today, Greenwich Mean Time.

65
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,793
She will have the verdict then. OK.
I was just keeping the troops happy.

66
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,673
They'd be happier if they knew they'd got jobs.

67
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,119
Yeah.

68
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,950
I'm thinking of other weird-looking bald people.

69
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,036
That one on Benny Hill?

70
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,559
Oh, yeah.

71
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,989
I don't know if you met Tim.
He's thinking of leaving.

72
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,111
He's feeling bad about himself.

73
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,028
I'm going to make him feel good
about himself, turn it round.

74
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,720
You know. Look and learn. So...

75
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,319
Timothy!

76
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,791
- Hi.
- Can I have a quick word?

77
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,036
In the office. Walk this way.

78
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,912
Quack, quack, quack!

79
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,996
Always start with a joke.

80
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,116
You might want to make notes.

81
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,879
Hiya. Come in.

82
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,756
- How are you?
- All right, thanks.

83
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,872
You don't mind if Karen sits in
to learn the ropes?

84
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,070
No, not at all. What are we doing?

85
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,476
I wanted to know
why you're thinking of leaving, mate.

86
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:50,073
I'm not thinking of leaving, I am leaving.

87
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,474
Sure. Sure.

88
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,275
I don't mean to stitch anyone up,
but it's nothing I've said?

89
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,756
- Not at all, David. No.
- Definitely not. No way.

90
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,838
I don't want to put words in your mouth,

91
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,793
but what sort of a boss would you say I am?

92
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,831
- I'm a...
- Good boss, yeah.

93
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,474
- He said good.
- No. You're a great boss.

94
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,194
It's just that I'm not in a position...

95
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,392
It's not because you asked Dawn out
and she said no?

96
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,795
I didn't ask her out. It was as a friend.

97
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,992
It was as a friend. Put friend. Put friend down.

98
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,429
So why the move?

99
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,113
- It's not one thing...
- Go on.

100
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,196
- Can I...?
- Sure.

101
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:35,755
OK. I don't really enjoy the work
I do here. I'm sorry, but...

102
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,918
I feel a little bit like I'm wasting my time.

103
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,032
- That life's too short.
- Exactly. Thank you.

104
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,515
Let's be honest, David, I am 30.

105
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:48,599
- I want to retire with some stories to tell.
- Not about paper.

106
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,360
I've got paper stories that'll crack you up.

107
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,119
- That's true. Hilarious.
- Put hilarious.

108
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,117
- Shall I go on?
- How many are there?

109
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:00,472
It's like an alarm clock's gone off
and I've just got to get away.

110
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,716
I think it was John Lennon who said...

111
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,111
"Life is what happens
when you're making other plans."

112
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,276
That's how I feel.

113
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,831
Though he also said,
"I am the walrus, I am the eggman",

114
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,916
so I don't know what to believe!

115
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:20,555
- David, listen...
- No, you listen to me, "Tim".

116
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:24,673
When you first came here,
you didn't know about the paper industry.

117
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,156
I showed you the ropes,
nurtured you, gave you a good job.

118
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,669
- That he doesn't want!
- I didn't ask you.

119
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,997
- You asked me how I felt...
- I don't want to know now.

120
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,350
This has been a waste of time. Yeah.

121
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:40,519
Why don't you both go and do some work
instead of whinging, please?

122
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,392
- This is silly...
- No, go on.

123
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:46,479
Don't say out there what you said
in here, apart from the good boss.

124
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:50,798
I don't want you spreading bad vibes
around my office, all right?

125
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,877
Don't be like that at the party!

126
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,236
You try and do a good deed...

127
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,918
and that...

128
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,393
You all right?

129
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,839
Yeah. Hello.

130
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,275
Are you going to the party?

131
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,278
Yeah, yeah. Of course. I wouldn't miss it.

132
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,436
- And you?
- Er, yes.

133
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,879
Good.

134
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,599
Hooray.

135
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,996
- See you later.
- Yeah.

136
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,756
(DAWN) I hope they get rid of me.

137
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,838
Then I might get off my arse and do something.

138
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:44,272
I don't think it's many little
girls' dream to be a receptionist.

139
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,629
I don't know what I'll do,
but it's got to be a career move

140
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,796
and not just another arbitrary job.

141
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,239
Um...

142
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,751
Tim says it's better to be at the foot
of a ladder you want to climb

143
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,836
than halfway up one you don't.

144
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:05,197
But I don't... I just don't
want to be treading water

145
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,790
and wake up in five years and say,
"Shit! Done it again."

146
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,596
(GRATING WHIRRING NOISE)

147
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,832
Do you think you could...?

148
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:30,111
Could you not do that here, mate?
Not do that here?

149
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,196
I've got to do it, mate. Really.

150
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,115
No chance you could throw it in the bin?

151
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,913
Yeah, and I'll take them round
to rival companies and hand them out.

152
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:43,396
Good point, but could you throw it
in the bin?

153
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,312
Gareth, can you keep it down a bit?

154
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,396
- Hmm?
- Can you stop it?

155
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,435
Yeah. I'll just do it like this.

156
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,910
- Hiya.
- Hi, David. Are you ready?

157
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,314
Yeah.

158
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,036
- Who's she?
- Don't know.

159
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,959
I promised you some kind of answer today.

160
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:26,358
I don't think it's the one you're expecting.
Firstly, I'm moving on.

161
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,871
- Have you been fired?
- No. I've been made into a partner.

162
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:36,193
They've made you a partner?
That'll be Wernham Hogg Taylor Clark.

163
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,356
They'll have to change the stationery.

164
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,836
- I think we'll get a discount.
- 40% sometimes.

165
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,394
The point is, my job is now available

166
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,990
and the board thought
that you or Neil should do it.

167
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:54,475
I can tell you the board have voted
5-2 in favour of you taking it.

168
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,996
Voted for me 5-2?
There's only seven on the board.

169
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,759
Five out of seven. That's a landslide.

170
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,632
- David...
- Go on.

171
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:08,594
You've made it clear that
you're 100% committed to your branch.

172
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,759
You do understand that if you take
on my job, Neil will stay in Swindon

173
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,077
and your branch will be downsized
and incorporated into his?

174
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,474
Yup.

175
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,239
I know that you're loyal to your family...

176
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,670
I'd be loyal to the whole family.
It's one big family.

177
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:28,316
I just know that you have strong
emotional ties to your team.

178
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:33,468
Yeah, but there is the emotion as
"good in business" syndrome, sure,

179
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,115
notwithstanding the cruel to be kind scenario...

180
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,832
Sorry, you've lost me.

181
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:42,669
You're not looking at the whole pie.
Wernham Hogg is one big pie

182
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,473
and if I'm in charge of that big pie,

183
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,672
I'll be in charge of... The people are the fruit.

184
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,394
I don't have time for the pie thing, David.

185
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:54,114
I'm saying, OK, I'll take the job, please.

186
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,153
Good. OK. The first step
is to meet with Alan and the board.

187
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:01,477
Yup. What's five out of seven as a percentage?

188
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,919
Er... 70%.

189
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,679
71.4. So...

190
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:09,952
Call Susan and arrange to meet the board
and finalise all the details.

191
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,036
Congratulations and good luck.

192
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,119
You don't need luck when you've got
71% of the population behind you.

193
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,912
She's still here.

194
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,992
Bye, Jennifer.

195
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:35,231
- What do you think?
- He looked all right.

196
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,554
- How did it go?
- What did she say?

197
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,033
Fine.

198
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,878
What's the damage?

199
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,158
It's complicated.

200
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,794
- Are you going to tell us?
- Yeah.

201
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,999
David?

204
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,997
We'd like to know now.

205
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,111
OK. All right.

206
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,319
OK. Gather.

Um...

208
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:13,229
Well, there's good news and bad news.

209
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,751
The bad news is Neil
will be taking over both branches

210
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,996
and some of you will lose your jobs.

211
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:25,597
Those of you who are kept on
will have to relocate to Swindon...

I know, I know. Gutting. Gutting.

You didn't see me.

214
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:39,159
On a more positive note,
the good news is I've been promoted.

215
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,718
So... every cloud...

216
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,189
You're still thinking about the bad news.

217
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,915
There's no good news.
It's bad news and irrelevant news.

218
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:00,318
That's not a phrase though.
"I've got bad news and irrelevant news."

219
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:04,399
You could have told us about Neil
and kept your promotion to yourself.

220
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,317
Or told you the good news first...

221
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,590
There is no good news, David.

222
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,110
I think promotion is generally
considered good news.

223
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,676
- We're going to lose our jobs!
- You're not all going to.

224
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,153
God! Just...

225
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:20,750
You're not going to lose your job.
You're not going to.

226
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,916
You know... You're not going to.

227
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,350
So just get it in perspective, yeah?

228
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,234
Come on.

229
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,555
You know there's only seven people
on the board...

230
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:40,353
When are the rest of us going to find out?

231
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:46,799
I can't believe it.
After all the things he said, it's just...

232
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,558
I'm in shock.

233
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,239
Sold us out.

234
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,839
Wanker.

235
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,560
What? David Brent's leaving?

236
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,591
So you're definitely leaving?

237
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,391
Yup, it would appear so.

238
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,797
What about us?

239
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,798
- There's nothing between us.
- Not like that.

240
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,831
But we're a team.

241
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,076
I'm Assistant Regional Manager.

242
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,953
- Assistant to the Regional Manager.
- Yeah.

243
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:30,074
So I can still be your assistant
if you're going off to the...?

244
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:34,318
No. I'll be getting a proper assistant - a P.A.

245
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,271
- A lady?
- Hopefully, yeah.

246
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,436
Not 'cause of that, just...

247
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,951
What about Neil? Does he need an...?
I could be his assistant.

248
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,275
Neil's bringing his man with him.

249
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,517
Bloody good guy. Bloke called Terry someone.

250
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,676
You'd like him. He's ex-army.

00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,393
- No.
- Regular?

Yeah.

00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,553
- What rank?
- Sergeant, I think.

- Yeah. I've got it on video.

Well then, yeah?

267
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:42,030
Before he goes into battle,
he's playing with his dog.

268
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,196
- Nigger.
- That's not offensive.

269
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,029
That's the dog's name.
It's the '40s, before racism was bad.

270
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,993
- The dog was called Nigger.
- Don't keep saying it.

- Take anything you want.
- To keep?

275
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,675
- Yup.
- I'll have the guitar.

276
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:14,190
Not the guitar. I meant stationery.
Something I can re-order.

277
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,311
The hole punch. That's always handy.

281
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,911
Could be used as confetti, yeah.

- Put it there.

- A bit out of your league.

- Definitely.
- No. Smug.

313
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:31,430
You think you're so...
Just 'cause you got a bit of Donna,

314
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:34,552
and I played by the rules
'cause she was out of bounds.

315
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:38,753
You sneaked in. I'd have got a bit
if I'd known it was up for grabs.

316
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,839
I'd have done her, but that would
be shitting on your own doorstep.

Anyway, I don't do sloppy seconds.

318

It's phrases like sloppy seconds
which make her out of your league.

Welcome, everybody. A few things.

See the raffle there? That's going to start later.

You can win a printer. Something I'd bloody love.

I'd give it to charity or something,

Should have seen
what we got Pete Gibbons. Oooh!

He'll tell you. We all remember that. So...

where I was officially
offered the job as UK Manager.

344

As you know, taking that job means
a lot of you will lose your jobs,

345
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,757
and I'd just like to say...

346
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:12,394
I told them to shove their job up their arses!

- Yes. We all are.

- Alan's assistant.

She thinks you didn't take the job
not because you didn't want it,
