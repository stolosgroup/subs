2
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,913
Sorry.

3
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:56,998
No problem. No problem. Um... half an hour?

4
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,033
Another day, another dollar.

5
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,435
Any mail?

6
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,838
- That's your... that's an earring.
- Whatever. Get over it.

7
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:15,112
- How long have you had that?
- Too long, baby.

8
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,880
- It's bleeding.
- Really stings.

9
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,232
- Is it an old one that...?
- Yeah. I had to push really hard.

10
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:27,639
- They heal over.
- It had healed over. So I opened a sore...

11
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:34,239
- what are you looking at?
- Nothing.

12
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:37,796
You know ray and jude
that I had the meeting with?

13
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,348
You know they do training seminars
and use expert speakers.

14
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,714
- They're using me... for my...
- expertise.

15
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,276
The good news for you is you're involved.

16
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,755
- How?
- I'm doing one tonight.

17
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,918
I'm getting quite a bit of money for it. £300.

18
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:03,113
So I need someone
just to carry my bag and organise...

19
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,312
- I'm not...
- £100 for an hour's work.

20
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,592
- £100 for an hour? That is a lot.
- 80.

21
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,518
- You said 100.
- 90.

22
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,712
- You said 100.
- All right. Get there early, then.

23
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,718
Sharing the wealth, see? Looking after...

24
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,878
that is silly money. I should have...

25
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,119
very exciting.
It's what I've always wanted to do.

26
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,709
I've had these cards made up.

27
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,913
"David brent. Assertiveness
and guidance training in business.

28
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:38,591
"If it's in you, I'll find it."
That's actually what I do.

29
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,316
I just point out what you've already got.
I'm like a spiritual guide.

30
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:48,355
The reason I put "lf" it's in you is
if I waste time and money looking for it

31
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,315
and I can see it's not in you, I don't want
to be sued because you haven't got it.

32
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,830
You're not going to get me on that.

33
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,632
- What's going on here?
- What does it look like?

34
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,435
- When were you going to tell me?
- Huh?

35
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,837
I can't believe
you'd get off with a bird I fancy.

36
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,473
Why not?

37
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,549
I can't believe a bird fancies you over me.
He's a weird little bloke.

38
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:32,357
Look at his hair. He looks like
a fisher price man. His rubbish clothes.

39
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:38,590
There must be something wrong with you,
but I'd still do you, so I'm confused.

40
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:45,717
I'll ask you straight. Can anything happen
between us two while this is going on?

41
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,390
- Like what?
- Specifically?

42
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,033
Yeah.

43
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,359
Hand job? Don't answer. Think about it.

44
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,353
- Do I look like a fisher price man?
- Yeah!

45
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,357
Don't say yeah.

46
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,716
- Hi, dawn.
- Hi.

47
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,356
- Your favourite computer geek is here.
- Jesus!

48
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,357
All right, simon? How's it going?

49
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,394
What are you doing with my computer?

50
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,388
It's not your computer, is it?
It's wernham-hogg's.

51
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,114
What are you doing
with wernham-hogg's computer?

52
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,154
- You don't need to know.
- No, but tell me anyway.

53
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:48,114
- I'm installing a firewall.
- What's that?

54
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,791
Protects your computer
against viruses, worms and trojan horses

55
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,833
and limits your internet communications.

56
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,600
- How long will it take?
- Why?

57
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,510
- Out of interest.
- It will take as long as it takes.

58
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,679
- How long did it take last time...?
- It's done.

59
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:12,317
When it comes back on
it'll ask you to hit yes, no or cancel.

60
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,717
- Hit cancel. Do not hit yes or no.
- Right.

61
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,911
- Did you hear what I said?
- Yup.

62
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,111
- What did I say?
- Hit cancel.

63
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,356
Um... I'm an educator.

64
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,953
I'm a motivator of people.
I excite their imaginations.

65
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:37,109
It's like bloody "dead poet's society"
when they all stand on the tables...

66
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:41,711
I wouldn't want them on the tables -
it's against health and safety.

67
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:46,516
Life is about communication.
We live for threescore year and ten

68
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,350
and it's "did I communicate?" "yes."
"Did I get something across?" "yes."

69
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:56,509
"Are you going to pay me for it?"
"Yes. Lots." not why I do it, but thank you.

70
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,833
- Going karting this weekend with the lads.
- What, down super karts?

71
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,315
- Mm.
- You any good?

72
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,354
Came first last time. Got a certificate.

73
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:18,475
I went down there when it opened.
I did a couple of laps, pulled over.

74
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:23,629
The owner said, "no professionals."
I said, "I'm not a professional."

75
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,991
He said, "you're not a professional?
You should be.

76
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:31,113
"Take up formula one.
You'll be the best in the country."

77
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:35,677
I said, "I'm not interested.
I'm making shitloads in computers."

78
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,836
You ever tried speedway?

79
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,871
- Have you?
- Yeah.

80
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:46,713
I was doing it once, bombing it round
and some idiot had left a ramp thing out.

81
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:53,075
People were going, "if that guy hits that
ramp at that speed, he's definitely dead."

82
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:58,593
I hit the ramp, turned over in the air.
They were going, "he's definitely dead."

83
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,758
Landed on my wheels and pulled over.

84
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,509
- About five?
- Five.

85
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,996
- Who's this chat with?
- Mothers' meeting?

86
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:15,877
- Dawn says she's shutting down at five.
- Just half an hour early today.

87
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:21,154
- Can it run ok without her?
- Yeah. They can answer their own phones.

88
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,319
- So we can lose her altogether, can we?
- What do you mean?

89
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,957
- Either she's needed or she's not.
- We do need a receptionist.

90
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,435
You haven't put a system in place.

91
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:37,236
You've told dawn to shut at five.
You haven't told people to get the phone.

92
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,228
- Does dawn know about the post?
- They can do their own post.

93
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,035
It's no use telling her now.
There's no system.

94
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,836
- I'm tired of this fuzzy thinking.
- Chill out. Don't have a cow, mate.

95
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:54,272
Don't talk to me like you've forgotten
who's in charge. I'm your boss.

96
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,233
- Yeah.
- Try and think things through.

97
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,589
That was your fault. I took the rap for you.

98
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,599
Once, when bruce lee was filming,
one of the extras started a fight.

99
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,349
He was amazing at kung fu
but lee did a roundhouse on him...

100
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:26,510
no. He smashed him through a wall. Instead
of firing him, he said, "go on with the filming."

101
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,676
Those cats were fast as lightning.

102
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,110
You know he fights chuck norris
in "enter the dragon"...?

103
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,550
- No.
- You've not seen that?

104
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,594
- No.
- Have you not...? That is a classic.

105
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:43,318
I've seen him fight chuck norris
in "way of the dragon."

106
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,272
That's what I meant.

107
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,278
You said you saw him fight norris
in "enter the dragon".

108
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,792
He fights bob wall in both,
but norris is only in "way of the dragon."

109
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,230
- So he's fighting norris...
- in what?

110
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,749
- "Way of the dragon."
- Correct.

111
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:02,192
- Um...
- you know bruce lee's not really dead?

112
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:07,679
It's in a book. He faked his own death
to work undercover for the hong kong police

113
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:11,316
- infiltrating the triads.
- I reckon it's true.

114
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:15,638
Yeah, because if you wanted
to send someone undercover,

115
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:19,799
you'd want the world's most famous
chinese film star!

116
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,434
Gone off dawn now, have you?

117
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,155
- What?
- What? What are you talking about?

118
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,113
Just shut up. Shut up.

119
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:43,234
Do a credit check.
We haven't worked with them for ages.

120
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,591
- I said we'd go round about four.
- Yeah.

121
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,316
- Oi, tim.
- Mm?

122
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,795
- You shagged her yet?
- What?

123
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,991
- Your bird?
- Rachel?

124
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,351
- Have you done her yet?
- Course he hasn't.

125
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:08,600
I don't kiss and tell, lee.
I bet you bloody have.

126
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,428
Lips are sealed. Don't ask me.

127
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,756
He's done well there.

128
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:19,238
- What do you mean?
- She's tasty. She's nice.

129
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,716
- You don't know her.
- She's very attractive.

130
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,878
She's not very attractive.

131
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:31,268
Ray will introduce me
and I'll come out and do a few gags,

132
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,677
then I'll go, "you have
to be thick-skinned in business.

133
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:39,317
"Whether you're the tea-boy or the manager,
people will try to shake your spirit.

134
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:42,398
"Do not listen. Let's do an exercise."

135
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,718
Then I'll pick on someone at random.
"Sir. What's your name?"

136
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,915
- Say your name.
- Leroy.

137
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,873
- Who's leroy?
- The coloured fellow off "fame".

138
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,275
- Use your own name.
- Gareth.

139
00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:00,508
"Hi, gareth. Insult me. Let me show you
that sticks and stones may break my bones

140
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,756
"but names will never hurt me."

141
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:06,714
Throw some insults at me
and I'll roll with the punches.

142
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,115
The swindon lot don't respect you.

143
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:13,916
They don't know me.
And it's not true. Do something else.

144
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:19,114
- People are laughing at your heels.
- I'm not going to wear those shoes!

145
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:23,279
- And the earring?
- They're having a go at that? What else?

146
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,233
- They've given you a nickname.
- The swindon lot?

147
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,715
- Everyone's using it.
- What is it?

148
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,911
- I don't really...
- what is it?

149
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,588
- Bluto.
- The villain from popeye?

150
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,394
- 'Cause of the beard?
- Because he's...

151
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:42,232
- what's that? I can't believe this.
- They'll know it was me! David!

152
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,676
Hello. Sorry, everybody.

153
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:52,078
Look, we are one big happy family here.

154
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:55,909
I've been trying to welcome you new guys.

155
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:01,114
I didn't want you here,
but you're here now, so well done. Welcome.

156
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:05,438
But if there's one thing I don't like,
it's nicknames.

157
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:11,715
Because nicknames are bad... names.

158
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,838
Yeah? They're not helpful.

159
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:20,318
They can be hurtful. Not to me -
it's like water off a duck's back, but...

160
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:24,479
- you used to call malcolm "kojak".
- That was affectionate.

161
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:28,719
- He was a great detective.
- Maybe "mr toad" is affectionate.

162
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:32,356
- Who's mr toad?
- Some people call you that.

163
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,996
- I thought I was bluto?
- Yeah. Bluto and mr toad.

164
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,475
Why am I mr toad?

165
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:43,196
There's the face again.
It's an insult, isn't it? Very...

166
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:49,077
body fascism that is. The toad
is the ugliest of all the amphibians.

167
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:53,319
If we're handing out insults for being fat,
let's have a go at him.

168
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:58,640
Look at him. And he's got glasses.
Let's call him four-eyes as well.

169
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:05,188
Why don't we call him fatty fatty toad boy?
At least start on him and then move on...

170
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,753
mr toad! I can't...

171
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,071
- everything adding up?
- Yeah. It was a real mess beforehand.

172
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,350
- On top of it now?
- Yes.

173
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,109
- How about you, brenda?
- Ok, but I didn't get my wages.

174
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,757
- Did you not? Did you tell david?
- Yes. I told him in time.

175
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:36,748
I'm sorry about that.
Let me sort that out for you.

176
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,428
- I don't want to cause...
- don't worry.

177
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,194
- Working hard?
- Working out.

178
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:53,713
- Fit body. Fit mind.
- Good. Couple of things.

179
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:00,550
- Did your wages go through ok this month?
- Yeah.

180
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,239
- Yours, gareth?
- Yup.

181
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:07,958
Good. So you two are ok. Why, then, has one
of your team not been paid this month?

182
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,916
Oh. Eh?

183
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,713
No.

184
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:21,075
He fears my methods because he doesn't
understand them. Human nature, but relax.

185
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:25,592
I don't want all this,
"what are you doing? How are you doing it?"

186
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,234
No. Judge me by my results.

187
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:32,877
This is not the first time
you've forgotten something important.

188
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,516
- People shouldn't have to come to me.
- Snitches.

189
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,111
I've never seen you write anything down.
Do you use your computers?

190
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,790
- You've got to have a system.
- It's all up there.

191
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,833
- It's not all up there, is it?
- Most of it is.

192
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,998
When I was managing the swindon branch,

193
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,272
we thought your branch were having a laugh.

194
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,040
- Thanks very much.
- Not in a good way.

195
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,312
Mucking around
at the expense of wernham-hogg.

196
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:04,069
Who's to say if they weren't having a laugh,
it would be...

197
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:09,718
I'm not interested in that. I think
you'd rather be popular than steer the ship.

198
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,038
Rubbish. This branch has performed very well.

199
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,595
I want it to perform a lot better.

200
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:22,557
What is "better?" on a graph of people
versus task, where does the line go?

201
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:28,312
Where I say. If you can't improve your sales -
with or without making people laugh -

202
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:31,990
you and I will have to have a serious chat.

203
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:36,159
Is this why you're always around?
I don't need a babysitter.

204
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,316
With respect, david, you do.

205
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:42,672
I'm worried this management thing tonight
is affecting your performance.

206
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,110
It's extracurricular, like golf.

207
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,912
- I play golf.
- There.

208
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,874
Yes, but I'm performing
as I want me to perform. You're not.

209
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:55,995
I'm performing as I want to. It's a good
performance. Let's agree to disagree.

210
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,430
No. Let's agree that you agree with me.

211
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,477
Ooh. You're hard. Showing off because...

212
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,639
I think I've made my point, david.
I'll see you later.

213
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,715
- What are you doing?
- You're tense.

214
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,990
I am with him...

215
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,839
- does that feel nice?
- Yeah, but...

216
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:29,352
- do some more work on your abs?
- Not now.

217
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,795
- Is he ready yet?
- Who?

218
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,594
- David.
- I dunno.

219
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:21,509
- What are you doing tonight?
- We're going to the pub.

220
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,790
- "We" is?
- Me and rachel.

221
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,391
- Excellent. Just a couple of pints.
- We won't go mad.

222
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:32,957
Think of me, stuck with...
you should come for a laugh.

223
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:37,119
- We'd better stay out of it.
- Definitely. Wise.

224
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:40,278
- All right, babes.
- See you later.

225
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,955
See you later. We're off on our date.

226
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,870
It's not a date. I'm paying her.
What sort of date is that?

227
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,913
And £100. what would I get for that?

228
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:05,192
Not that I would. Everything, I imagine.

229
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:09,552
I'm not imagining any of it,
but I do know... I'm just...

230
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,196
carry that.
That's what you're being paid for.

231
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:33,439
Tonight you've got two groups.
They're both from reading.

232
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:52,118
The other three guys
have all done it before, so...

233
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:57,269
- I'll introduce you when they get here.
- I love being backstage.

234
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:02,508
Can I take a photo? It's for the website
and the newsletter, if that's ok?

235
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,998
- No problem. You taking a light reading?
- I think it'll be ok.

236
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,634
- If you just...
- yeah.

237
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,160
Just be yourself. A bit more relaxed.

238
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,149
Something like that?

239
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,480
- Not quite.
- Ok.

240
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,756
- Maybe if you just sit down.
- You're the boss.

241
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:55,197
I'm looking forward to this.
I think it'll be quite a good one.

242
00:19:55,400 --> 00:20:00,190
- Hello, mate.
- Are you guys talking at this gig as well?

243
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,994
Yeah. We're just having a sneaky joint.

244
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:08,228
Well, partially decriminalised now anyway,
isn't it? At last.

245
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,954
- Go for it.
- Ok.

246
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:14,550
- Is it skunk?
- Just weed. You want a taste?

247
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,194
- You sure?
- Yeah. I'm on a diet.

248
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:21,439
When I get wasted, I go to munchie-city, so...

249
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:26,589
I'm mad enough without the gear as well.
I'll take a rain check. Catch you later.

250
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,472
- Yeah.
- Chill.

251
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,837
We've got four speakers for you tonight,
so no messing about.

252
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:38,999
To begin with, from sound investments,
mr mark found.

253
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,396
Let me dispel a myth.

254
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:52,550
If you're a success, some people will tell you
you shouldn't be able to sleep at night.

255
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:57,754
You should. Why? Because this is a business.

256
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:06,119
Your future hasn't happened yet.
You shape it. You're in the driving seat.

257
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,912
Thanks.

258
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,870
Thanks to richard clark from stockport graphics.

259
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:22,518
Now advice on motivational techniques.
From wernham-hogg, mr david brent.

260
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,070
Get out.

261
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:46,115
Go on. I've opened the door for you.

262
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,389
If you're not going to make it, go now.
Yeah?

263
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,912
Save us all a bit of time.
If you don't think you can cut it.

264
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,790
No? Good.

265
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,833
- You finished in there?
- No.

266
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,276
Ok.

267
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,992
You're all thinking, "you're a success.

268
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,034
"You've achieved your goals.
You're reaping the rewards."

269
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:23,518
"Oi, brent! Is all you care about
chasing the yankee dollar?"

270
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:26,678
Let me show you something I keep with me.

271
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:34,148
"Collective meditations." it's a collection
of philosophers, writers, thinkers.

272
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:37,272
Native american wisdom.

273
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:40,392
And it's really showing you

274
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:45,833
that the spiritual side needs
as much attention as the physical side.

275
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:50,192
It's about feeding the soul.
Evolving spirituality.

276
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,393
Foreword by duncan goodhew. So...

277
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,518
can I read one that I think...?

278
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,190
"If all men were to bring
their miseries together in one place,

279
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,518
"most would be glad
to take each his own home again

280
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,269
"rather than take a portion
out of the common stock."

281
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:15,759
It's saying the grass
isn't always greener on the other side.

282
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:21,318
Don't see your neighbour and think,
"he's got a better car. A more attractive wife."

283
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:26,639
We all wake up and go,
"oh, I ache. I'm not 18 anymore."

284
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:32,312
I'm 39... I'm in my 30s.
But so what? At least I've got my health.

285
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:37,275
If you've got one leg,
at least you haven't got two legs missing.

286
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:42,634
If you have lost both legs and both arms,
just go, "at least I'm not dead!"

287
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,754
I'd rather be dead in that situation,
to be honest.

288
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:51,635
I'm not saying people like that
should be put down.

289
00:23:54,920 --> 00:24:00,199
I'm saying that in my life, I'd rather
not live without arms and legs because...

290
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:04,197
I'm just getting into yoga, for one thing.

291
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:12,591
Are you familiar with the term,
"laughter is the best medicine"?

292
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,352
It's true.

293
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:22,510
When you laugh, your brain releases
endorphins, your stress hormones reduce

294
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,395
and the oxygen supply
to your blood is increased.

295
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:31,355
I try to laugh several times a day
because it makes you feel good.

296
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:34,438
Let's try that. Who-hoo-hoo.

297
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,713
Just...

298
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,755
trust me, you'll feel...

299
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,752
yeah?

300
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:09,552
I'd be lying if I said my life
had turned out exactly as I'd expected.

301
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:15,118
My old school recently had a school reunion,
which I didn't go to,

302
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:18,551
but one girl in my class, it turns out,

303
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:23,197
is running her own internet auction website,
making a fortune

304
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:26,119
and is married to a marine biologist.

305
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,470
She used to eat chalk.

306
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:35,955
That's about it from yours truly. Thanks for
taking all I had to throw at you. I'm spent.

307
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:40,836
I am now going to make
like a banana and split!

308
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,670
He got it. Ok.

309
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:50,432
Before I go, though,
promise me you'll remember one thing.

310
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,437
Just remember...

311
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,917
# you're better than all the rest

312
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,835
# better than anyone

313
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,871
listen to her.

314
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,230
# Anyone I've ever met

315
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,510
come on. Get into it.

316
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,870
# I'm stuck on your heart

317
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:18,034
I've been david brent.
You've been the best. Goodnight.

318
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:22,199
# Tear us apart

319
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:28,192
# baby, I would rather be dead... #

320
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:35,874
- er... our thanks to david...

321
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,832
- who stopped it?
- I did.

322
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:41,112
No. Leave it going right to the end
till I get...

323
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,638
- don't do that again next time.
- Sorry.

324
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,997
David brent from wernham-hogg.

325
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:02,069
I'll let you into a little secret -
I was worried whether I still had it.

326
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,390
I'll let you judge. High five.

327
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,352
Thank you, dawn.

328
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,749
Oh, jeez! Here he is.

329
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,714
- Tina too much for you?
- Possibly.

330
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:18,117
Hold me back,
because when I'm out there I am...

331
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,835
and it's like...
so that's up to you, I'm afraid.

332
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,308
They seemed to go for it.

333
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,636
- Knock knock.
- You all right?

334
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:31,513
- Yeah. Well done.
- What did you think?

335
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:34,632
- My tastes are traditional...
- too rock and roll?

336
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,796
- Possibly.
- Each his own.

337
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,357
That was me on a seven.
Wait till you see me on a nine or ten!

338
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:44,870
- Here's your cheque.
- Thanking you.

339
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:48,038
More importantly, what pub we going to?

340
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:55,231
More important than £300?
I don't think so! Where we going?

341
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,274
- We'll just grab some food and go home.
- Pizza?

342
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:03,439
Yeah? Never mind pizza express,
what about beer express?

343
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,074
"Next stop, drunkenness!"

344
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:10,068
We can go anywhere you want.
Chinese? Indian?

345
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:13,238
As long as it's... it's on me!

346
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:24,800
The three musketeers!
Oh, I can't. What?
There's something I've got to do.

347
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,668
Just us two, then.
What clubs are round here?

348
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,714
- I'm not going to a club.
- You bloody are!

349
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:43,838
# So what becomes of you, my love

350
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:50,117
# when they have finally stripped you of

351
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,709
# the handbags and the gladrags

352
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:57,914
# that your granddad had to sweat
so you could buy #

353
00:28:58,305 --> 00:29:58,663
