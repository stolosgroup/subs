00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,794
- Hello. You all right?
- Yeah. Good, thanks.

3
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,959
See that film last night? Denzil Washington?

4
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:46,277
- No.
- He's a brilliant actor.

5
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,677
- He's very good.
- Oh, dear.

6
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,314
- I like him.
- He's great.

7
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:56,438
- See you later.
- See you later.

8
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:04,034
- He's not my favourite actor of all time.
- No?

9
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:08,438
No. My favourite actor of all time
is Mr Sidney Poitier.

10
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,797
- Well.
- So... All right?

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,594
Yeah. Amazing.

12
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,988
- Gareth, are you building up your wrists?
- Yes.

13
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:31,555
When is the charity wank-athon?

14
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:35,514
- I don't know, but you'd win it.
- That's good.

15
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:40,157
- Seriously, what are you doing?
- Orienteering with the TAs.

16
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,232
All right?

17
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,670
- Yeah. I've just come to apologise.
- Don't worry about it.

18
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:54,670
No. I was out of order. I'd had
a really bad day. I shouldn't have done it.

19
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,438
Well...

20
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,713
- So we're cool, yeah?
- Absolutely. Totally cool.

21
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,434
What's that? Is that for me?

22
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,596
- Yeah.
- Cheers.

23
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:09,156
There's nothing going on between them.

24
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,036
I've been watching him
and I imagine you've been watching her,

25
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,312
so between us we've got it covered.

26
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,117
- See you later, mate.
- Yeah. Thanks for that. Cheers.

27
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,439
- Probably a bottle of something.
- You reckon?

28
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,949
Look at the shape.

29
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,994
Today I'm doing our staff appraisals.

30
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,078
Some people can get nervous -

31
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,956
they think they're putting their head
on the block, which is wrong.

32
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,594
They fill out a form in advance

33
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:00,830
and they don't only list their strengths
and weaknesses, but also mine as a boss.

34
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,477
So it's a chance for them to tell me
where we're going wrong.

35
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,435
- It's an opportunity...
- To separate the wheat from the chaff.

36
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:15,839
No. That sounds bad. We're not trying
to find out who the worst people are.

37
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:19,476
We know who they are.
I've put them on my form.

38
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,240
- No...
- I've underlined the worst ones.

39
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,273
You're missing the point. Yeah...

40
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,834
- Hello, David.
- Here he is.

41
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,555
Tim Canterbury. A good man.
"The Canterbury Tales."

42
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,880
- Chaucer.
- Yup.

43
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,036
And Shakespeare.

44
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,828
Pleased with you. Very proud.
New leaf, et cetera.

45
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:52,319
Trust, encouragement, reward,
loyalty, satisfaction. That's what I'm...

46
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:56,035
Wondering why
I am so generous with encouragement?

47
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,478
Trust people and they'll be true to you.

48
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:05,356
Treat them greatly
and they will show themselves to be great.

49
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,029
So happier now? No looking back?

50
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,949
I am eventually
going to do a psychology degree, but...

51
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:18,757
No point. No point. Sure, 18-19,
go to university, get it out of your system.

52
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:22,350
Waste time mucking around, getting drunk...

53
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,314
- Having casual sex.
- But we're in our 30s now.

54
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:32,834
- I'm only just 30. You're 39?
- No. Both in our 30s is the fact. Yeah?

55
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:42,790
Who's to say? In a few years time,
you could be in the hot seat... like me.

56
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,676
- When I'm nearly 40.
- We're both in our 30s at the moment.

57
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:52,954
Just chewing the fat.
Good. You're on the right lines.

58
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:58,075
Can I just...?
If we're facing in the right direction,

59
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:01,955
all we have to do is keep on walking.

60
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,510
Very nice. You're quite a philosopher.

61
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,793
It's just that I think our greatest glory...

62
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,709
is not in never falling,
but in rising when we do.

63
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,195
- Are you reading these?
- What?

64
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,953
Confucius. Bernard Shaw...

65
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,119
It doesn't matter who said them.
I'm passing on my wisdom.

66
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:31,917
Don't tell those I've been reading these.
It's an insult. I'll put it down there.

67
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,953
I wanted to be a children's illustrator.

68
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,799
When people asked what I did, I'd say,

69
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,754
"I'm an illustrator,
but I do some reception work."

70
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,033
For years I was an illustrator
who did some reception work.

71
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:53,677
Then Lee thought
we should both get full-time jobs.

72
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:59,034
Then you're knackered after work
and it's hard to do illustrating.

73
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:04,030
Now, when people ask what I do,
I say, "I'm a receptionist."

74
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,714
And a bloody good one.

75
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:14,152
You'll always have the art.
Keep up the doodling always.

76
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:18,399
- Pipe dreams are good.
- I still hope it will happen.

77
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:24,391
Keep the dream alive because otherwise
you'll go, "Could I have made it?"

78
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:30,311
If you keep trying, when it doesn't happen,
you can go, "At least I gave it a go."

79
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,988
You know?

80
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,748
- Are you settling in all right?
- Yeah.

81
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,394
- Having fun?
- Yeah.

82
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,275
As much fun
as you can have at Wernham-Hogg.

83
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:53,237
- How long were you at Swindon?
- Two years.

84
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,876
If you had to name a role model...

85
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,956
who would it be?

86
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:06,235
- Like a historical person?
- No, just someone in general life.

87
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:12,879
There's my mum. She's strong,
calm in the face of adversity.

88
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,390
I remember when she had a hysterectomy...

89
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:21,833
If it wasn't your mother, though.
It doesn't even have to be a woman.

90
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:27,034
A man? OK.
I suppose if it was a man it'd be my father.

91
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:33,395
Not your father. Take your parents as read.
I mean someone in the work-related arena.

92
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:37,388
Right. OK. I suppose Tim, then. He's always...

93
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:42,116
He's a friend. Not a friend.
Someone in authority.

94
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:47,440
- Then, I suppose Jennifer.
- We said not a woman. Or am I...?

95
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:52,839
Er... OK.
I suppose you're the only one who...

96
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:58,955
Embarrassing. It's backfired.
Oh, dear. Very flattering.

97
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,913
- Can we put me as a...?
- OK. Tim, then.

98
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,793
- We said not Tim. Do you want me?
- OK.

99
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,958
- So shall I put "strong role model"?
- OK.

100
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,558
(ALARM RINGS)

101
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:24,719
Just a drill. Do not panic.

102
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:30,040
- He's trained. Good man.
- Come on, people, let's get moving.

103
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,676
- I'd be the last one out.
- Do not run and do not panic.

104
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:39,477
That's just what I do.
We do these every couple of months.

105
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:45,949
Even though I'm always cool in a situation
like this, some people are not,

106
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,958
and so I try to make sure... I'll do that.

107
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:52,596
- We were...
- No, no. I've got it.

108
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,314
I'm going to get you out of here.

109
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:12,078
The lifts... are out of bounds...
in a fire... situation,

110
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:15,750
so the important thing is... Put her down.

111
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,988
This isn't worth it. It's stupid.

112
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,079
This is just a drill, so we can leave her here.

113
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:29,034
- Can't I use the lift?
- No, not even in a drill.

114
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,595
We won't be a minute.

115
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,473
I've got no problem
with him visiting every child in a night,

116
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:01,196
but I can't believe he stands
in Barnardo's arguing with old women.

117
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:07,071
I don't know if you're aware
of the situation that's arising here.

118
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:12,229
I usually steer clear of ladies at work,
but there's someone I've got my eye on.

119
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:16,399
I won't say who.
I don't know what Tim's playing at.

120
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:21,435
He embarrassed himself asking Dawn out
and this will end in tears.

121
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:25,110
Whereas I, you probably notice, play it cool.

122
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,756
He's not a man of the world like me.

123
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,719
I can read women.
You've got to know their needs.

124
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:38,596
That can be making sure she's
got enough money to buy groceries

125
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:43,555
or making sure
she's gratified sexually after intercourse.

126
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,511
(ALARM CONTINUES)

127
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,876
You were using all your best lines on Rachel.

128
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,833
Best lines! Just being friendly.

129
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,635
It was friendly, but more than.

130
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,274
- More than?
- Friendly.

131
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:24,754
Under "strengths", you've just put "accounts".

132
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,473
Yeah.

133
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:32,270
That's your job, though. That's just...

134
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:39,033
Keith. I'm looking for skills within your job.
Is there anything else you can put?

135
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,676
- No.
- OK.

136
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:49,318
Under "weaknesses", you've put "eczema".

137
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,672
You had a fantastically welcoming buffet.

138
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:01,271
- The wine was something else.
- Everyone's quite friendly.

139
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:06,235
- Everyone's... And Tim seems nice.
- Yeah. He's a good laugh.

140
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:11,951
I've just got to... Has he got a girlfriend?

141
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,311
- Tim? No.
- Why? What's up?

142
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:19,399
- Nothing.
- Why? Would you?

143
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,876
Mm? Out of the equation.

144
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:26,117
I know, but if you weren't, would he...?

145
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,312
If I weren't? Madness.

146
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,437
You've left this section blank.
You haven't done the Q&A.

147
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:42,077
- I thought you filled that in.
- No. This is aimed at you.

148
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:48,150
"To what extent do you believe that you have
the skills to perform your job effectively?"

149
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:53,434
You tick the boxes. "Not at all.
To some extent. Very much so. Don't know."

150
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:57,519
- What would you tick?
- Don't know.

151
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,313
OK.

152
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:08,355
"Do you feel you have received adequate
training to use your computer effectively?"

153
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:17,198
- What are the options?
- They're always the same.

154
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,756
"Not at all. To some extent.
Very much so. Don't know."

155
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:24,236
- Don't know.
- Don't know again. OK.

156
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:31,278
"Do you feel you are given the flexibility
to decide how to accomplish your goals?"

157
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,356
- Do you want the options?
- Yeah.

158
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,836
"Not at all. To some extent..."
Always the same.

159
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,190
- "Very much so. Don't know."
- Don't know.

160
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:47,154
If "Don't know" wasn't there,
what would you put?

161
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:55,076
- What are the options?
- "Not at all. To some extent.

162
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,840
- "Very much so. Don't know."
- Very much so.

163
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,996
- Do you remember the question?
- No.

164
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,636
"Do you...?" We're going to leave that.

165
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:15,274
Just going to give the new Swindon lot a...
It's not an appraisal as such, but...

166
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,233
(LAUGHTER)

167
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:24,037
- Sorry. Just showing them...
- Keep them occupied before the main event.

168
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,995
I hope you warmed them up
better than last time! Doesn't look like it.

169
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:33,830
- OK. See you later.
- See you. Bye.

170
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:37,669
Anyway... good. Hello.

171
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:43,438
I can't give you an appraisal -
you've only been here a week -

172
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,632
but I wanted to see how you're settling in.

173
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:53,909
I know it's not the same vibe you're used to.
Neil ruled with more of an iron fist.

174
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,873
Settling in? Having a good time?

175
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,990
How is it different?

176
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,078
More laid back, presumably.

177
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:10,876
- Think it's more laid back? Yeah?
- Yeah...

178
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:14,834
Say yes, then, if it's more laid back.
More fun.

179
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,632
- Well...
- Eh?

180
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,796
- Nothing.
- Go on.

181
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:25,269
We're actually used to doing stuff,
like working hard, being motivated.

182
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:29,917
There's not much dynamism.
People get away with murder.

183
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:34,511
- Having a laugh, yes.
- Quite a few of us are bored.

184
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,473
What, you prefer Swindon?

185
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,515
- More of a laugh.
- You're having a laugh saying that.

186
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,518
What's so good about Swindon? Neil?

187
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,792
- Yeah, for one.
- You prefer Neil to me?

188
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:54,393
Who thinks Neil's more of a laugh than me?

189
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:59,990
That's mental! Come off it. You...

190
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:04,876
Come out for a drink with me
and see who's more of a laugh.

191
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:08,516
We'll go for a drink lunchtime. Right.

192
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:15,438
Right. Here we are.
There's an outing, lunchtime.

193
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:20,350
Show them what the Slough lot are like.
Keith, what are you doing lunchtime?

194
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,838
Welcome to Alcoholic's Anonymous!
No. Purely social.

195
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:36,034
I know an alcoholic and it's no laughing
matter - particularly for his wife.

196
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,869
She's got alopecia, so not a happy home life.

197
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:43,550
Their eldest is like Dustin Hoffman
in "Rain Man".

198
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:47,753
That probably turned him to it
in the first place.

199
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,474
Looking forward to the weekend?

200
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,194
- Yeah.
- Cheers.

201
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,992
That's a lovely drop. That's Courage.

202
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:03,149
You get a lot of that round here
because the main brewery's in Reading.

203
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,158
They do it in London too.

204
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:12,071
What's the brewery in Swindon?
Is there a big...?

205
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:15,716
- It might be Courage actually.
- Dunno.

206
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:19,276
No. This is all right, though, isn't it?

207
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,154
- Nice pub... Eh?
- Just a private joke.

208
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:29,798
I was saying this is nice. There's a lovely
pub near me - the Gardener's Arms.

209
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,518
- What are you doing?
- That bloke looks like someone we know.

210
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:41,158
OK. One at a time. Focus. You'll get
more out of it in the long run, I promise.

211
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:50,639
I forgot what I was saying.
That's what happens when you...

212
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,752
Courage...

213
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,475
- Three points.
- Don't do that on my head.

214
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:04,279
- Unless you've changed into a dartboard.
- The dartboard makes no difference to you.

215
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,074
I could sit here and still get 180.

216
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:11,273
- Hiya. You all right?
- Straight.

217
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,950
A couple of my mates
are going down to Yates's...

218
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:20,917
- The wine lodge? Classy. Joking.
- I was wondering if you'd like to come.

219
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,237
Or not. And you, Dawn. Bring Lee.

220
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:28,911
- I don't think we can...
- OK. You can come?

221
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,669
- Yeah, I can.
- Great. OK.

222
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,395
- Tonight?
- Yeah. Just after work.

223
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,478
- Have a couple of drinks, yeah.
- Cool.

224
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:43,116
- OK. See you later.
- See you in a bit.

225
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,829
- That'll be fun.
- Yeah. Yes.

226
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:52,112
It'll be cool. Cool as a cucumber.

227
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,798
- Good?
- It was all right.

228
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,911
I've eaten here, so...

229
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,995
If you want a really good pie - The Gardeners.

230
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:45,315
It's been a washout, hasn't it?
If no one else is going to make the effort.

231
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,590
- We have made the effort.
- Eh?

232
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:52,555
- We have made the effort.
- Yeah. I'm not having a go at you.

233
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:57,754
Obviously the best people haven't come.
I'm going back to the office.

234
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,316
See you later.

235
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,192
- Come on, Neil.
- All right.

236
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,755
- Gareth.
- Nearly.

237
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,188
- What are you doing?
- Having a laugh.

238
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:25,996
You could have had a laugh in the pub.
Dangerous, isn't it?

239
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:31,672
- You should work. It's quarter past two.
- All right. We're just finishing off.

240
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:37,318
Just want to be popular as the new boss.
Oh, love me! Pathetic!

241
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:52,034
I think we should call it a day there.
Do you mind putting those away?

242
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,993
Guys, can we go back to work?

243
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,273
- David, can I have a word?
- If you want.

244
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,711
Obviously you've got a problem, what is it?

245
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:07,037
No. Time for work, wasn't it?

246
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:12,633
If you don't want to say, fine, but don't
speak to me like that in front of staff.

247
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,354
- You're acting like a petulant kid.
- Yeah.

248
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:22,038
Don't stand out there and embarrass me
and yourself, because I will not stand for it.

249
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,028
I've been trying to deal
with this situation delicately

250
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:31,268
because I was embarrassed that I'm now
your boss, but you have to live with it.

251
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:37,191
I don't let anyone talk to me like that
and certainly not you. Do you understand?

252
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,517
Do you understand? Good.

253
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:46,272
You're a good bloke, Dave, and if there's
a problem I'd rather discuss it sensibly.

254
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,436
Shake on it?

255
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,596
Great. Thank you.

256
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:04,077
- I'll see you guys later. Take care.
- Cheers, Neil.

257
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,030
- Did you hear any of that conversation?
- No.

258
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,630
I had it out with Neil.
He showed his true colours.

259
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,308
He seems like a good bloke.

260
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:27,389
I'd better not say anything, then.
Watch your back. Slagging you off.

261
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,989
- Slagging you off.
- Me personally?

262
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:34,034
- Just me?
- Yeah. And you. Slagging all you lot off.

263
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,949
- What's he saying?
- Saying you lot were rubbish.

264
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:41,709
I was going, "Your Swindon lot are shit."

265
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:45,879
- He got aggressive and I went berserk.
- Did you hit him?

266
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:50,676
- He'd have come through that wall.
- He's pretty trim, mate.

267
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,189
Yeah? Against karate?

268
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:57,871
- What did he actually say about us?
- Just slagging you lot off.

269
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:02,278
I went, "Your Swindon lot
are little slugs with no personality.

270
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,756
"You're jealous
that we're better at everything."

271
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:10,158
If it did kick off with him,
I don't want you lot getting hurt.

272
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:13,796
- I'd step in.
- This is big boy shit, mate.

273
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,437
Hit him above the ears because
the vacuum in the brain kills instantly.

274
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,792
I'd want to keep the twat alive
with the shit I was going to pull.

275
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,155
- All right?
- Hello.

276
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,397
- You don't have a boyfriend, do you?
- No.

277
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:44,832
- Any kids from previous marriages?
- No.

278
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:50,990
- Would you like to come out for a drink?
- I can't. I'm going to go out with Tim.

279
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,270
- Tonight?
- Yeah.

280
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:56,313
- Can I come?
- Not really.

281
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:01,353
- You're not going to get off with him?
- It's not your business.

282
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:07,635
Sorry. It's none of my business. Go and have
a drink, by all means. Enjoy yourself.

283
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:12,118
If you don't go all the way with Tim,
I will still be interested.

284
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:16,313
Thanks. Good to know
I have something to fall back on.

285
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:20,274
What if I go all the way with Tim
but want more with you?

286
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:24,440
I don't usually do sloppy seconds,

287
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:30,431
but I judge things on individual merit,
so we'll cross that river when we come to it.

288
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,110
- Thanks. That's good to know.
- No problem.

289
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:42,194
- One in the kettle?
- Yeah. It's just boiled.

290
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,472
One amendment.
If you do go all the way with Tim

291
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:51,038
and you expect me to go in there afterwards,
make sure he wears a condom.

292
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,196
It's sort of a rule.

293
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,790
- Is there any milk?
- Yeah. In the fridge.

294
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,754
- See ya.
- See you later, mate.

295
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:20,153
- You going home?
- Yup.

296
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,308
- That's for you.
- Cheers.

297
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:31,592
Can you call Neilson's...

298
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:37,716
and get that credit rate faxed over
or emailed or whatever?

299
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,239
Sure.

300
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:45,072
And do you mind typing up
those appraisal contracts?

301
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,840
- Sure. See you Monday.
- See you.

302
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:52,875
Dawn, I'm fed up.
I'm fed up, to be honest. It's just...

303
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:57,949
- Why?
- I think this place is a right shit hole.

304
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,276
- Do you?
- Yeah.

305
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:09,758
- Do you think I'm funny?
- Mmm. Yup.

306
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,918
Do you think Neil's funny? Sit down.

307
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:18,751
Do I think Neil's funny?
I don't really know him, David.

308
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,919
- But he's not funnier than me?
- Definitely not.

309
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:28,752
I wish you'd tell that to the Swindon lot -
miserable bunch of... Aren't they? Boring.

310
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:36,359
What's your favourite stuff that I do,
comedy-wise?

311
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:40,917
Um... Oh, there's too much.

312
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,554
- The impressions?
- Yeah.

313
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:49,949
- Which ones?
- Er... Which ones are there again?

314
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,116
- Kermit?
- Brilliant.

315
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:56,598
"Welcome to the er Muppet Show."
"Hai-ya, Frog!"

316
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:00,554
Miss Piggy.
Do you know Kermit's nephew, Robin?

317
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:05,515
# Halfway up the stair
is the stair where I sit... #

318
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:09,679
- Do you do Gonzo?
- No. Do you want a beer?

319
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:15,955
- Er... I can't go to the pub.
- I've got some here ready.

320
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,435
For emergencies.

321
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,917
Cheers.

322
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,869
I was looking through...

323
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,676
some old poems I used to do.

324
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,348
- Oh? I didn't know.
- Yeah.

325
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:47,237
- What sort of...?
- Quite sort of... powerful. Here's one.

326
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,877
Shall I read one to you?
This one's called "Excalibur".

327
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:59,277
"I froze your tears and made a dagger
and stabbed it in my cock forever.

328
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:03,951
"It stays there like Excalibur.
Are you my Arthur? Say you are."

329
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:07,550
- Good...
- "Take this cool, dark, steeled blade.

330
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,957
"Steal it, sheath it in your lake.

331
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:17,110
"I'd drown with you to be together.
Must you breathe? 'Cause I need heaven."

332
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,796
- Um... It's powerful.
- Very.

333
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,753
- Did you get the double meanings?
- I did.

334
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,360
(WHISTLING)

335
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:52,956
# So what becomes of you, my love,

336
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:58,797
# When they have finally stripped you of

337
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,434
# The handbags and the gladrags

338
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:05,679
# That your granddad had to sweat
so you could buy? #

339
00:29:06,305 --> 00:30:06,288
