2
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,357
What's that about? Tell me.

3
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,598
Because, at the end of the day,
you can say something

4
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:38,395
and then it doesn't mean that you
can't ever change your mind.

5
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,829
It's you that's changing your mind.

6
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:46,337
Fine! But what's wrong with that?
Yeah, I feel sorry for Dawn and Lee

7
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,914
If they have to call off the wedding...

8
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,396
then i'm sure it'll be upsetting now,

9
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,476
but in the end, it's for the best.

10
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,510
The thing about long-term marriage

11
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,915
is that, inevitably, the sex suffers.

12
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,919
You constantly have to find new
and erotic ways

13
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,917
of spicing things up in the bedroom.

14
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,475
It's a gift and training.

15
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,798
I mean, you can... it's like i was
good at it before i was trained,

16
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:18,879
but now i'm trained i'm better
than people who weren't good before.

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,389
Today's our staff training.

18
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,550
I do a couple a year.

19
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,240
This is rowan, our facilitator for the day.

20
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:31,716
It's good to get in an outsider now and again.

21
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,798
It helps to keep them
sort of interested, you know.

22
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,912
And i'm trained in it.
I have an mba from bradford.

23
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,794
I'm trained in it as well.
I could have done this myself.

24
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,639
Let me tell you what today is all about.

25
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:47,752
- I can do that...
- well, it's my... thing.

26
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,394
It's about customer care, really.

27
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,398
Investment in people - i.e. The staff.

28
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,830
Letting them know they are
our most important commodity,

29
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,918
and if they've got a problem, it's my problem...

30
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,074
er...

31
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:09,153
it's like if you're cleaning
a floor and you're up against it,

32
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,829
then come to me and i'll help us
clean our floor together.

33
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,234
So...

34
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,234
not literally.

35
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,112
See you in there.

36
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,399
I'm really sorry.

37
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,956
Things will be ok
between you and lee, you know,

38
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,675
because you and lee are going
to be together, and he knows that,

39
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,598
and if he doesn't appreciate that,
he's mad.

40
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,154
If he doesn't appreciate it, i'll marry you!

41
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,789
Hello. You're through to keith.

42
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,233
I will be at training all day today.

43
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,318
Please call me or leave a message
and i will call you tomorrow.

44
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,591
- You're so lovely.
- I'm not lovely.

45
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,438
- You are.
- No, you are.

46
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,070
- I'm snotty.
- You're snotty and lovely.

47
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,713
I'd marry your snot.

48
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,319
- Boys...
- all right, mate.

49
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,158
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

50
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,078
You're upset. About lee, is it?

51
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,077
Hey, don't worry, all right?

52
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,239
Monkey alan in the warehouse
fancies you even if no one else does.

53
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,633
What was that?

54
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,990
Can't say anything when they're like that.

55
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,271
No, you can't. You can't. I was doing ok.

56
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,796
What's this monkey alan business?

57
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,115
Well, he fancies her. I'm just saying.

58
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:50,550
She didn't need to know that.
It's monkey alan. The name...

59
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,148
i don't know who monkey alan is, but i bet...

60
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,589
- he's a little bloke.
- I don't need to know.

61
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,039
Go away, please.

62
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,193
Go over there.

63
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,990
I'm rowan, and i'm going to lead us
through today's sessions.

64
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,473
Under me.

65
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,955
As david actually has briefed me and says

66
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,310
a lot of this you'll be familiar with,

67
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,556
but it's not a bad idea to recap anyway,

68
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,433
and i hope a few new ideas will be thrown in.

69
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,996
We're going to start by watching
a video - a nice gentle start.

70
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,156
It's a bit cheesy and a bit '80s,

71
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,875
but i think a lot of the ideas
are still pretty valid. Ok?

72
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,834
A good idea is a good idea forever.

73
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,433
Yeah. Ok.

74
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,308
Philosophy.

75
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,954
Hi.

76
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:03,871
What's the single most important thing
to your business?

77
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,514
- Staff.
- That's right. The customer.

78
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,033
A different angle.

79
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,674
These are your profits for this year.

80
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,833
And this is what you're doing
to those profits...

81
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,030
if you underestimate
the value of customer care.

82
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,598
That's not real money.

83
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,395
- Do you know why?
- He'd be mad to burn it.

84
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:31,717
No. It's illegal
to destroy or burn anything

85
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,229
containing the queen's image of the realm.

86
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,238
- Can we just watch the video?
- Yeah. That's true.

87
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,035
Statistics show that if you're
treated well as a customer

88
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,912
you'll tell five people.

89
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,793
If you're treated badly, you'll tell nine.

90
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,878
- So can you set fire to a stamp?
- No.

91
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,912
In fact, a postage stamp is legal tender.

92
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,751
A bus driver would have
to accept that as currency.

93
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,753
- Yeah. That'd happen!
- If he doesn't, report him.

94
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,677
When i'm walking home.

95
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,473
Get a taxi if you've got enough stamps.

96
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,148
- Cash them at a post office.
- Shouldn't have to.

97
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,632
Shouldn't have to.

98
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,077
Here's a typical office.

99
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,440
Yeah? 0h, yeah. Awful, isn't it?

100
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,200
Yeah? Really? I asked him...

101
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,117
excuse me. I'm in a hurry.

102
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,198
I'm on the phone.
God, aren't people rude?

103
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,995
I must tell you about george.
It started about a year ago...

104
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,829
well done. That customer
won't be bothering you again.

105
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,519
Ever.

106
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,949
Let's see what should have happened.

107
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,548
Yeah. Yeah. Awful, isn't it?

108
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,433
Yeah? Really? You know, i said to him...

109
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,517
sorry, sir. I'll be right with you.

110
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,479
Sorry, jean. I have to go. I have a customer.

111
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,399
I'll call you back at a more convenient time.

112
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:53,357
All she had to do was acknowledge
the customer's presence

113
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,916
and end her personal call
as quickly as possible.

114
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,997
This is what we call the customer care tree...

115
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,072
your prescription will be ready
on friday, madam.

116
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,236
Fine. See you tuesday.

117
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,753
So if you've put together a crack team,

118
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:19,429
don't let your business get taken
hostage by complacency.

119
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,438
Make your motto "who cares, wins".

120
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,518
Hey, i know you. Can i have your autograph?

121
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,914
0f course.

122
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,598
Thank you, mr noakes.

123
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,316
Very good. Very good.

124
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,271
Ok, then. Right. That's that.

125
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,674
John noakes.

126
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,519
Yeah. They worked together on "blue peter".

127
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,359
- Can i...?
- She was short-sighted... yeah.

128
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,756
Ok. Right. Well, you've all seen the video.

129
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,348
Now it's time for the dreaded role play.

130
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,233
We'll kick off with your leader, david brent.

131
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:55,477
David, if you could come here.
Round of applause for david.

132
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,158
No, no, no.

133
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,877
Cheating. I have done this before.

134
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,719
Good. That should make it a lot easier for us.

135
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,638
- Nice and simple to start with.
- Hard as you like.

136
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,955
Well, let's kick off with something easy.

137
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,392
I want us to play out a scenario
that highlights customer care.

138
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,476
- Ok.
- All of you deal with people...

139
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:18,275
- all the time.
- You can all improve people skills.

140
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,437
In this scenario...
we'll start with something easy.

141
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,915
This will be the wrong way to do it!

142
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:27,635
I'm going to play a very bad
hotel manager who doesn't care...

143
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:32,709
if it's a basil fawlty character,
maybe i should do it for the comedy.

144
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,752
Let me just play it now to kick things off, ok?

145
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,871
I'll probably bring that to this role.

146
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,036
Right. You've got a complaint.

147
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:43,914
Come and complain and i'll show you
the wrong way to handle it.

148
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,871
Ok. So off we go.

149
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,278
- Sorry. What's the complaint?
- Just make it up.

150
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:55,951
Anything. There's no right or wrong thing
in this scenario.

151
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,152
We'll tell you the right thing afterwards.

152
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,759
- You complain.
- Right.

153
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,111
- Ok. I'd like to make a complaint.
- I don't care.

154
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,832
- I am staying in the hotel...
- it's not my shift.

155
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,916
You're an ambassador for the hotel.

156
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,713
- I don't care.
- You will when i tell you.

157
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,796
There's been a rape up there!

158
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:27,759
I got his attention. Get their attention. Ok?

159
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:32,196
- Right. Some interesting points...
- very interesting points.

160
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,073
It's not quite the point i was trying to make.

161
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,679
Different points to be made.

162
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,030
- I'm interested in customer care.
- So am i.

163
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,469
- And the way we'd deal with...
- i fazed you.

164
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,478
Maybe i should play the manager
as i'm used to it.

165
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,115
I fazed you. You have a go.
See if you can faze me. Ok?

166
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,719
Yeah. All right.

167
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,276
- Hello. I wish to make a complaint.
- Not interested.

168
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,595
- My room is a disgrace.
- Don't care.

169
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,473
- The bathroom's dirty...
- what room are you in?

170
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,797
- 362.
- There is no 362 in this hotel.

171
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,994
Sometimes the complaints will be false.

172
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,076
Ok? Good.

173
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,832
Today is really about all of you
getting to know and trust each other.

174
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:25,033
So what i want us to do
is just spend a few minutes...

175
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,469
sorry. Can i have a quick word with dawn?

176
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,999
Dawn?

177
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:37,671
What i want us to do is for
everyone to tell me their name

178
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,678
and their ultimate dream -
their ultimate fantasy.

179
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,791
I'll kick things off. My name's rowan,

180
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,957
and my dream is to have my own island.

181
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,954
David.

182
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,912
It depends what you mean by ultimate fantasy

183
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,713
because time travel's actually impossible...

184
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,479
just interpret it any way you like.

185
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,275
Yeah. If you're talking
about anything that could

186
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,073
or could not be possible, actually.

187
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:08,671
Anything that could be conceived of
to happen or not,

188
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,838
within my realm, you know...

189
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,952
then probably some sort of everlasting life.

190
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:18,231
I don't just mean in a spiritual
or religious sense,

191
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,193
but actually to experience the future

192
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,278
and live, you know, on and on...

193
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,710
and on, and know what it's like to live forever.

194
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,199
I think i'm starting to know what that's like.

195
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,918
- I'm saying...
- no, hang on.

196
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:37,919
- You always have your say.
- When have i had my say?!

197
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,679
I've been engaged to lee for um...

198
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,916
god! ...about three years.

199
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,589
He proposed on a valentine's day.

200
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,472
He didn't do it face to face.

201
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:52,434
He did it in one of the valentine's
message bits in the paper.

202
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,879
Um...

203
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,073
i think he had to pay for it
by the word because it just said,

204
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,875
"lee love dawn. Marriage?"

205
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,872
Which i like.

206
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,074
It's not often you get something
that's both romantic and thrifty.

207
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,397
And don't phone my mum again!

208
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,036
- Dawn, do you want...?
- Don't.

209
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,874
Ok.

210
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,797
Um...

211
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,471
gareth, a quick trust exercise.
Ultimate fantasy?

212
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,797
- Hmm?
- We're doing the ultimate fantasy.

213
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,236
Two lesbians, probably. Sisters.
I'm just watching.

214
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,319
Ok. Um...

215
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,632
tim? Do you have one?

216
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:46,070
I never thought i'd say this,
but can i hear more from gareth?

217
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,756
Ok. Well, this next exercise is all about...

218
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,393
motivation.

219
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:00,478
That's going to be a key word today -
motivation.

220
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,238
So... keith?

221
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:06,194
What would you say was your motivation
for working here?

222
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,515
- Being part of a team.
- Let him answer.

223
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,596
That's what he'll say if you ask him.

224
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,154
I am asking him and i'd like him to answer.

225
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,677
Do you want to answer him?

226
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,791
This job's just a stop-gap, really.

227
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,117
The job's not difficult.
I don't take my work home.

228
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,150
- It's brainless.
- At your level maybe.

229
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:28,717
But, ultimately, i want to play music,
write music, play in a band.

230
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:32,116
Good luck! Been there, done that,
bought the t shirt. Next!

231
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,073
- You were in a band? A rock band?
- Yeah.

232
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:38,158
- What were you called?
- Foregone conclusion.

233
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,589
I'm not sure this is the right time...

234
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,075
- i've got to field the questions.
- David.

235
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,430
- What did you do?
- Singer-songwriter.

236
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:49,917
Lyrics man, mainly, but you know,
the music came easy as well, so...

237
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,555
ok. Right. So, are there
any more questions for david?

238
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,069
- No? Good.
- You didn't give them a chance.

239
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,556
- Did you want to say something?
- Were you successful?

240
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,672
Were we successful? I'll let you judge that

241
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,394
when i tell you that we were once supported

242
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:08,512
by a little-known scottish outfit called texas.

243
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:15,037
I get all this, "oh, david,
you're a brilliant singer-songwriter.

244
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:19,915
"You're stuck in slough while texas
are off making all the money,

245
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,076
"and they're rubbish compared to you."

246
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,952
I go, "don't slag them off."

247
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:28,549
I say, "i've been there,
i've done that. That's behind me."

248
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,113
And i respect...

249
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,199
the thing is, we're both good
in our own fields.

250
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,950
I'm sure texas couldn't run and manage
a successful paper merchants.

251
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,150
I couldn't do what...

252
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:46,152
actually, i could do what they do,
and i think they knew it back then.

253
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,396
Probably what spurred them on.

254
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,952
I wrote this. I only play songs
i've written myself.

255
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,798
He went home to get it.

256
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,957
# A spaceman came down
to answer some things

257
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,277
# the world gathered round
from paupers to kings

258
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,438
# i'll answer your questions,
i'll answer them true

259
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,711
# i'll show you the way,
you know what to do

260
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,957
# who is wrong and who is right?

261
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,555
# Yellow, brown, black or white

262
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,437
# the spaceman he answered,
you no longer mind

263
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:35,155
# i've opened your eyes,
you're now colour-blind... #

264
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,952
racial. So...

265
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:41,632
# she's the serpent
who guards the gates of hell... #

266
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,479
good stuff.

267
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:50,438
# Pretty girl on the hood of a cadillac, yeah

268
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,438
# she's broken down on freeway nine

269
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:57,634
# take a look at her engine, start it and

270
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,798
# gave a purr and then i rolled on by, bye bye

271
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,229
# free love on the free love freeway

272
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,634
everybody

273
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,876
# love is free and the freeway's long

274
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,595
# i've got some hot love
on the hot love highway

275
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,632
# i ain't going home 'cause my baby's gone

276
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,591
- she's dead.
- She's not dead.

277
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:24,472
# Long time later, see a cowboy crying

278
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:28,639
# i says, hey buddy, what can i do?

279
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:32,389
# He says, i lived a good life,
had about a thousand women

280
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,272
# i said, why the tears?

281
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,436
# He says, 'cause none of them was you... #

282
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,518
- what, you?
- No. He's looking at a photograph.

283
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:42,154
- Of you?
- No. Of his girlfriend.

284
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,791
- The video would show it.
- Sorry.

285
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,717
- Sounds a bit gay.
- It's not gay.

286
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,434
# Free love on the free love freeway

287
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,677

# She's gone! #

298
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,398
that's brilliant, david. Really good.

299
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,151
I'm trying to think of other ones.

300
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,157
- Right. That's lunch.
- Ok.

301
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:43,950
What, in the name of jumping
jehosaphat, was that song about?

302
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,949
I mean, what was that about?

303
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:51,232
What's he doing? What's warren
doing telling people to say please?

304
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,113
If you don't know,
you don't deserve a job. After you.

305
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,514
Thank you.

306
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:58,074
- Are you all right?
- Yes, thank you.

307
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,474
Good.

308
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,678
Are you ok?

309
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,396
Forget all about him. He's not worth it.

310
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,795
I go through this sort of thing all the time.

311
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,275
Although it's usually me who dumps them.

312
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,789
No one dumped anyone. It was an argument.

313
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,480
Come out with me. I'll find you a new bloke.

314
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,318
It was just an argument.

315
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,718
Well, i'm just saying.

316
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,629
Thanks. That's nice.

317
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,273
You ok?

318
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,277
- Yeah.
- Sit down.

319
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,834
Now, i don't want to pry,

320
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:41,953
but i am aware of your personal problem,

321
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:47,552
and i wouldn't be the boss
or the man that i am

322
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:51,912
if i didn't lend some words of encouragement.

323
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,868
This is something i wrote. I hope it helps.

324
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,390
# Rose, you never used your thorns

325
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:03,159
# the ones you loved abandoned you

326
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,078
# your angel face made hearts so warm

327
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:09,715
# you helped the sick, but who helped you?

328
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,798
# Then rushing through the paris night

329
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:16,151
# they hounded you, you lost control

330
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,158
# we prayed that you would be all right

331
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,909
# the news came through, your body cold

332
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:28,718
# goodnight, my sweet princess... #

333
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,309
is that originally about princess diana?

334
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,598
Originally. But it fits perfectly, doesn't it?

335
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,271
Not the car crash bit.

336
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,954
Well...

337
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,152
your relationship with lee
is a bit like a car crash.

338
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,554
In paris?

339
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,079
City of love.

340
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,154
You're right. It fits perfectly. Thank you.

341
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,035
# Every breath you take

342
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,433
# every move you make, yeah... #

343
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,795
being dumped is the perfect excuse
to do all the things you want to do.

344
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:17,152
I wasn't dumped. And, actually,
i have been thinking of leaving.

345
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,429
How long have you been thinking of leaving?

346
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,596
- Who's leaving?
- I am.

347
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,678
Well, that's stupid. You've got a job here for life.

348
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,837
Yeah. I don't want to spend my life
answering phones

349
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,758
in some crappy sub-branch paper merchants.

350
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:35,111
Dawn, you could be answering
those phones in head office

351
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,798
or a better paper merchants.

352
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,876
Why waste her life in paper?

353
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,797
Not a waste, actually, not a waste.

354
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:45,118
Look at jeff lamp.
He's 42, he's got a porsche. That's from paper.

355
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,196
How long you been thinking of leaving?

356
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,557
And are you going to lay down
any of those tracks?

357
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:59,956
Well, i've got a lot on one demo
from the band days,

358
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,799
but they're about ten years old,
so if i put them out,

359
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,878
i'd have to lay down
some drum and bass shit on 'em.

360
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,274
Sample shit.

361
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,756
If you go back on the road,
are you going to need any help?

362
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,235
- Look, i'm sorry to...
- hold on. What?

363
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,749
Are you going to need a manager?

364
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,871
Well, i'll probably manage myself.

365
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,275
I could be your assistant manager.

366
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,670
You could be assistant
to the manager. Hold on, man. Shoot.

367
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,678
We've got a lot to get through and no one's back.

368
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,598
Get them over because rowan wants to crack on.

369
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,950
- Do you want me to discipline them?
- No.

370
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:39,074
Imagine him in a band. Bald old git.

371
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,229
The glasses would be stupid, so...

372
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,316
what's the vibe in the second half?

373
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,714
'Cause...

374
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:53,276
yeah. Not always for this company.
I've worked for... hi.

375
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,278
...various companies over the years.

376
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,710
How did you get into doing this?
How did you start?

377
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,196
Doing what i do? There are lots of ways, really.

378
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,951
Are you thinking of doing it?

379
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,595
I wouldn't mind, actually.
It looks like quite good fun.

380
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,756
- Does it?
- Yeah. Quite interesting.

381
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:18,476
Right. This next exercise
is all about forward planning

382
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,079
and team work.

383
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,839
I'm going to put you into pairs for this.

384
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,191
So um... gareth, if you can go with tim.

385
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,753
Oh, god!

386
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,631
I wouldn't want to be stuck with you
in a situation either.

387
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,512
A situation? What situation?

388
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:38,077
Who would you rather be with
on a desert island whittling wood and berries?

389
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,158
Daley thompson.

390
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,549
Ok. Let me give you the problem.

391
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,954
A farmer - not pictured -

392
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,117
has a chicken, a bag of grain and a fox,

393
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,549
and he needs to get them across the river,

394
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,352
but - and here's the rub -

395
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:00,836
his boat is only big enough
to take one item at a time.

396
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,316
I want you to work out in what order
he takes them across.

397
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,670
- Remember...
- five minutes, ok?

398
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:13,077
He can't take the fox first
because then the chicken will eat the seed.

399
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:22,753
He can't take the grain
because that leaves the fox and the chicken.

400
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,599
Fox and the chicken together? Bloodbath.

401
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:29,030
Yeah, i know. He can't
leave the chicken with the grain.

402
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:33,392
Er, hello? I'm a chicken.
Thanks for leaving me with my favourite food.

403
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,511
I'm saying you can't do that.

404
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,917
How big is this chicken?
The same size as a bag of grain?

405
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,630
- I don't know. Big chicken.
- How big?

406
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,637
Big. It's a super-chicken.

407
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,990
What's the farmer doing with a fox?

408
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,556
A fox is a farmer's worst enemy.
He should drown the fox.

409
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,989
Gareth, it's a puzzle. It's just a puzzle.

410
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,917
Yeah. Well, it's stupid.

411
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,838
What are we learning from it?

412
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,190
It's just a problem to be solved.

413
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,670
- Put the grain on a wall.
- There's no wall.

414
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,631
- There's always walls.
- Not here.

415
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:07,797
There's nothing? There's just a farm and a river?

416
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,876
- Get his wife to help.
- He ain't got one.

417
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,150
- All farmers have wives.
- This one's gay.

418
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,669
Then he shouldn't be allowed near animals.

419
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:20,630
- You'd take the grain next.
- Then the grain.

420
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,636
He's got to take the chicken first,

421
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,593
so he can leave the fox with the grain.

422
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,030
- Shall i tell them?
- No, i'll do it.

423
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:40,630
- They're more receptive to me.
- It's straightforward. Right.

424
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:43,194
Here's the answer.

425
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:47,359
First he takes the chicken across,
leaving the fox with the grain.

426
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:51,075
Then he brings the fox across,
but he brings the chicken back.

427
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,953
Then he takes the grain across,
leaves it with the fox,

428
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,116
then he comes back for the chicken.

429
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,834
- I'm sure you all got the answer...
- easy.

430
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,794
Yeah, but the important thing here
is that you were working as a team.

431
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,399
Sorry. Gareth?

432
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,191
Yeah. Some questions.

433
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,233
I hope that exercise demonstrated that it's vital

434
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,636
- that every member of a team...
- follows a leader.

435
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:22,309
Well, knows their place within that structure.

436
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:25,113
- Some may be leaders...
- he knows best, or she.

437
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:29,438
- Whoever is in charge may be...
- in a team of women, for example.

438
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:34,031
It may be women or men.
Somebody may be scoring the goals...

439
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,674
- can't stress that enough.
- Absolutely.

440
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:40,110
- You may not be the person who...
- unconditional trust...

441
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,196
...is returned in leadership.

442
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:46,359
It's important that you know
your place and that you are supported...

443
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,950
- maybe we should just move on...
- move on.

444
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,150
To another exercise.

445
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,157
What about this one?

446
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:57,556
What do we think might be the lesson here?

447
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,954
Dogs?

448
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,713
Say what you see, gareth.

449
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,472
- Give a dog a bone.
- He's not roy walker, gareth.

450
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,874
What is it?

451
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,788
If we pull together in the same direction,
it's better for us all.

452
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,751
They could be fighting.

453
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,359
They're smiling.

454
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,552
In the picture, maybe, but in reality...

455
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:25,352
look, the point here is
that if the team is focused on its objectives,

456
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,471
and those of the individual members,

457
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,239
it's easier for everyone to achieve their goals.

458
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:34,717
Exactly. Like the fable. You know
the one when the dog's got a bone.

459
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:37,957
He goes down to the lake to drink
and sees his reflection.

460
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,834
He goes, "that dog's got a better bone.
I'll have his as well."

461
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:47,398
And when he opens his mouth,
he drops the real bone and loses both.

462
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,556
And what's that got to do with this?

463
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:54,116
It's what gareth was saying
about if we've got our bones,

464
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,312
don't go for other people's bones
because you'll lose yours.

465
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,078
What does that mean?

466
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:03,238
Oh, don't you know? I thought it was...

467
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,194
bones.

468
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:09,154
- I'm bored of this. I am so bored.
- Yeah. So am i.

469
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,351
I don't mean this. I mean everything.

470
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,471
The job. Sorry, rowan, no disrespect.

471
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:16,353
- This is a waste of time.
- I know how you feel.

472
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,913
Let's get on with this.

473
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,315
I can't take any more of this nonsense.

474
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:24,592
I can't take another boring call
about index board at 230 a ton.

475
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,995
- 260.
- You're a twat, ok? Shut up.

476
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:31,033
Shut up. I'll give you my...
we'll work out my notice.

477
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,718
I'm going. Goodbye.

478
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,438
He'll be fine.

479
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,709
A waste of time. It was all a waste of time.

480
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,833
Oh, see? Pressure.

481
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,791
Not as easy as it looks.

482
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:50,434
Sometimes the experience outweighs the...

483
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,273
sorry, david. Dawn.

484
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:57,279
Now you've split up with lee,
would you like to come out for a drink?

485
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,029
I haven't split up with him.

486
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:09,918
I know. I meant as a friend.
I did mean as a friend.

487
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:12,429
Ok. See you later. Yeah.

488
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,672
Go and get the guitar.

489
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,834
I'll probably write a song about this one day.

490
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:44,439
# So what becomes of you, my love, whoa

491
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:48,838
# when they have finally stripped you of

492
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,520
# the handbags and the gladrags

493
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:55,428
# that your granddad had to sweat
so you could buy, yeah! #

494
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,995
we used to have a political reggae
one called equality street.

495
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,954
Ok.

496
00:29:07,305 --> 00:30:07,376
