2
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,596
I'm not thinking about it, I'm doing it.

3
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,790
I'm leaving to go back to university

4
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:37,789
to learn about more than the price
of opti-bright laser copy paper.

5
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,388
298 a gram.
- 240 a gram. Check the list.

6
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,988
I didn't hear you. What are you going to study?

7
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,439
Psychology.

8
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,711
Why do you want to be a psychiatrist?
They're all mad.

9
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,717
I want to be a psychologist.

10
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,310
Same difference. If you're so clever,
what am I thinking about?

11
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,035
You're thinking, 'How could I kill
a tiger armed only with a biro?'

12
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,479
No.
- No.

13
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:02,673
You're thinking, 'If I crash land
in a jungle, can I eat my own shoes?'

14
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,394
No, and you can't.
- What are you thinking?

15
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:08,796
I was just thinking, 'Will there ever be a boy born

16
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,480
'who can swim faster than a shark?'

17
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,239
All right?

18
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,510
Oh, midday. Are you just getting in?

19
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,710
No. I'll be here in about an hour.

20
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,949
About an hour. You're already here.

21
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,870
Who am I, then, Dixon of Dock Green?

22
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,437
What?
- Evening, all.

23
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,835
Brilliant.
- Sorry I'm late.

24
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,635
Not so worried about that,
but while you're lodging with me,

25
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:50,514
your parents have entrusted me
with their most valuable possession - you.

26
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,039
Yeah?

27
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,037
Ipso facto.

28
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:59,792
Trust received,
responsibility given and taken. Yeah?

29
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,759
I'm your guardian. You stayed out all night.

30
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,476
You stayed with a friend, fine.
I'm annoyed her parents didn't call me.

31
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,273
His parents weren't in.
- It's a bloke, so what?

32
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,756
Come on. God. Chill out, shall we, please?

33
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,154
You know... Girlfriend happens to be a boy.

34
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,794
I could stay at Dawn's...
- No, you couldn't.

35
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,708
I could if I got off with... off at...
Got off at the wrong bus stop.

36
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:28,468
I could. I'd be on the floor...
- We spent some time on the floor.

37
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,114
For a good reason, probably.

38
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,639
More room.

39
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,760
Just go free. Come on. Jesus.

40
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:39,270
But if I did stay at Dawn's...
- Which you couldn't.

41
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,075
You could stay at mine.
- I don't want to stay at yours.

42
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,430
The point is, if I did stay at Dawn's...

43
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,353
there'd be no funny business.
There was none, fine...

44
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,950
Apart from all the sex,
but we'll do it at your place next time.

45
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,155
It wasn't anyone in the office, was it?

46
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,272
Yes. I slept with someone in the office, everybody!

47
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,597
Show's over. Good. Well done. That's fine.

48
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,950
Don't even... It's not that...

49
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,433
Oh...

50
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,799
Oh...

51
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,031
I'd let you stay at mine.

52
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:23,472
I'm getting a secretary because I need one. So...

53
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,110
The lucky contestants are...

54
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,474
All right?

55
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,830
This is Stuart Foot.
- Hello, Stuart.

56
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,916
Karen Roper.
- Mr Brent.

57
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,837
I don't know a Mr Brent. David.

58
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,069
She'll brighten up the place, won't she?

59
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,909
If she gets the job. So will you.
Because you're both equal.

60
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:48,068
No foregone conclusion.
Based on interview... and merit.

61
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,748
It is up to me, ultimately, but good luck.

62
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,872
You'll do well to impress me. Nurse, the Polaroid!

63
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,513
Just for um...

64
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,633
Just for er... Sit down. To take a snapshot.

65
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:04,275
Just for the files. I'll do it. I'll do it.

66
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,876
Let's get that lovely smile on...

67
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,991
I'll come down here.

68
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,588
That's nice. Oh, the hair all...

69
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,154
Lovely. That looks nice. Lovely blue eyes.

70
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,793
OK. Big smile.

71
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,232
That was lovely. Just give that a minute.

72
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,754
Look at that. Do one of you as well.

73
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,153
Good.

74
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,268
Good.
- We're doing Stuart first.

75
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,516
Let's get him out the way. Follow me.

76
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,119
Good.

77
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,392
Stuart Foot.

78
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,553
What is that?

79
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,639
Money don't make my world go round.
I'm reaching out to a higher ground.

80
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,911
Is that a philosopher?
- Desree.

81
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,953
The singer?

82
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,719
I don't think I...

83
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,275
Why do you want to work here? Shoot.

84
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,636
Yeah. The 'bosses' are panicking.

85
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,911
They're going, 'Oh, cut back, lose staff.

86
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:52,510
'That's the way forward.
That'll save money. ' Will it?

87
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:58,192
Who's to say that hiring staff
won't save money in the long run?

88
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,869
Does a struggling salesman
start turning up on a bicycle?

89
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,231
No. He turns up in a newer car. Perception, yeah?

90
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,113
They've got to trust me.
I'm taking them into battle,

91
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,231
and I'm doing my own stapling.

92
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:14,194
A sergeant major spends his time
training his men to be killers.

93
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,276
He doesn't polish his own boots.

94
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,115
He probably does polish his own boots,

95
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,470
but, you know, that doesn't mean...

96
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,953
It doesn't mean I have to do my own filing.

97
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,599
Hi. Are you ready to see Karen Roper now?

98
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,994
Yeah.

99
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,712
Thank you.
- Hi.

100
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,114
Hello.

101
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,958
Sit down.
- OK.

102
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,150
No. I've got one over here for you.

103
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,514
Good.

104
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,232
Good.

105
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,634
Right.

106
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,113
The interview.

107
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,519
What have we got here? Hmm.

108
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,232
Karen Roper.

109
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,630
Curriculum vitae.

110
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,035
Just looking at this. Checking it out.

111
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,835
Good. Tell me about yourself.

112
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,839
Um... Well, I did GCSEs and A-levels and...

113
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,349
Too boring. Tell me about yourself.

114
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:53,630
OK. Well, I'm quite into films and music.

115
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,079
Yeah?

116
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,874
Desree?

117
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,276
I don't really know...
- Let's put that down.

118
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,436
Last year, I took a year out and I went travelling.

119
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,757
Exploring...
- Exploring yourself.

120
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,553
And Asia.

121
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,752
Was this with your boyfriend?
- No. On my own.

122
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,155
Just by yourself out there. Free.

123
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,752
Getting what you can while you're young.

124
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,637
I don't know when...

125
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,752
You've charmed me, yeah? You've got the job.

126
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,831
Think of a decision, I make it.

127
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:40,748
Work out your notice
and I'll put you on a month's probation.

128
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,394
That's just to see if we...
- OK.

129
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,988
Yeah? Good. Good.

130
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,473
Out tonight celebrating, I suppose?

131
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,956
Er, yeah. Going to... Do you know the Chasers?

132
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,718
Oh, I don't believe it.

133
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:58,833
If you see three debauched drunkards
in the corner, keep away from us!

134
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:02,430
No, come over. The drinks will be on me. In me!

135
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,233
What time are you there?
- It's not definite...

136
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,477
No. Come down. Definitely. What's your tipple?

137
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,511
Vodka and coke.

138
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,198
Me - lager.

139
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:18,753
Finchy - lager.
Gareth - lager, sometimes cider. So...

140
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,599
Different drinks for different needs.

141
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,119
Yeah.

142
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,998
Good. Well done.

143
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,997
Congratulations.
- Thanks.

144
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,356
New secretary. Good.

145
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,753
Efficient.

146
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:48,719
So have you resigned, then?
- Yeah. I have to make it official.

147
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,912
You embarrassed yourself by asking Dawn out.

148
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:56,158
I didn't. Why does everyone think...?
It was as a friend.

149
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,236
Right.
- Just as a friend.

150
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,868
Hi, Donna. How's it going? Settling in?

151
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,078
Who left that there?

152
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,679
Um...

153
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:17,429
Yeah. There's a health and safety seminar later on,

154
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:21,189
which I'd like you to attend.
Compulsory, I'm afraid.

155
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,356
That's not to say it won't be fun.

156
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:26,950
I like to inject my own sense of fun into it.

157
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,230
Two o'clock in the meeting room.

158
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,634
See you there.

159
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,349
Just looking at the booklet at the moment?

160
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,554
Yeah.

161
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,592
What did you see on TV yesterday?
- I watched a video.

162
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,314
I watched 'Peak Practice'.
- I've never seen it.

163
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,591
Bloody repeat.
- Yeah. Annoying, isn't it?

164
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,676
Not for me. I hadn't seen it.

165
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:06,874
Boring, isn't it? Staying in
watching 'Peak Practice' with your life.

166
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,639
Yeah.
- Not for me. I like it.

167
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,320
Yeah. I just stayed in, had a big wank.

168
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,878
That should be enough.
- Yeah. Fine.

169
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,117
The information's elsewhere.
- He won't read it.

170
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,196
Despite having done it twice.

171
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:26,596
I'll have to get my P45 from my other job.

172
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,994
OK.

173
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,758
Brent, just Roper to beat!

174
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,749
I bloody love football, don't I?

175
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,838
Service, barman.

176
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,713
Lager. Vodka and coke. Gave her the gig.

177
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:42,356
Oh, the dreaded form. Does it say
whether you're married or single?

178
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,836
It doesn't matter. Bring your boyfriend tonight.

179
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,712
I don't have one.
- Whatever.

180
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,193
Oh, sorry!
- Oh!

181
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:53,313
Sorry. It is a man's game. That is... That is... Yeah.

182
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,237
I can't see.
- Accidental.

183
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,679
Sorry.

184
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,519
That's why they shouldn't get involved, really.

185
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,592
Hi.
- Hello. All right?

186
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:15,076
Yeah. I was just...
- I've got to go in a sec.

187
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,078
No. I can eat here.
- Of course.

188
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,589
So we should go for that drink.

189
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,358
Oh, yeah, yeah.

190
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,630
You, me and Lee.
- The three of us.

191
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:38,469
I can probably get someone to come along. Good.

192
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,478
Er, in the next few weeks?
- Definitely.

193
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,388
Right. I'll just check with Lee.
- Yeah. Absolutely. Of course.

194
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,431
Gareth.
- All right?

195
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,630
How are you, mate?

196
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,872
Good to see you.

197
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,956
Were you trying to get off with her?

198
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:20,869
OK. Welcome to Wernham Hogg
Health and Safety Training

199
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,594
with Gareth Keenan. OK?

200
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,359
That's me. Pleased to meet you.

201
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,152
There are many hidden dangers in the workspace

202
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:34,750
and we're going to find out
what those dangers are together.

203
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,553
Starting off with your workstation.

204
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:42,435
Now, I want you to imagine
that this is a mug of hot coffee.

205
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,269
It's not, because that would
be dangerous even in training.

206
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:51,873
What we're going to do is play
a little fun game that I've made up.

207
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,436
I like to have a bit of fun
when I'm teaching people.

208
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,791
I like a laugh most of the time -
in and out of work.

209
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:02,071
Some us are going out tonight...
- Shall we crack on?

210
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,075
Good. Keen. Excellent.

211
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:09,875
All right. Now watch where I place this mug...

212
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:15,351
in order to simulate where someone
might put a mug in real life.

213
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:21,269
What I want you to do is shout out -
shout, mind - 'safe' or 'dangerous. '

214
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,391
Think you could manage that?

215
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,152
OK. Let's go.

216
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,879
Dangerous.

217
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,592
Dangerous.

218
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,917
What have we learnt?
- Don't pour coffee on the computer.

219
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:01,396
Any fluids. Right? Good.

220
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,073
First-class, please.

221
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,077
Are you all right?
- Eh?

222
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,430
Are you all right?
- Yeah. Fine, thanks.

223
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,154
Have you had a good morning or a bad morning?

224
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:14,909
A bit of a... Oh, God, a bit of a mad morning.

225
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,508
Never mind.
- See you later.

226
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,914
OK.

227
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:25,279
Basically, there's a correct way
and an incorrect way to lift stuff.

228
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,436
This is the incorrect way.

229
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,918
OK? Incorrect.

230
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,515
The correct way. Two things to remember.

231
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,234
Keep your back nice and straight. Straight back.

232
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,998
And bend your knees.

233
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,033
Keep your back straight
and bend your knees. Right?

234
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,912
Very important.

235
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,631
Do you want to try that with me?

236
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,113
I'm fine.

237
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:55,317
I'm supposed to witness you do it
so I can tick the box.

238
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,273
Just do it with me a couple of times.

239
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:02,279
Right. So nice straight back, bend your knees...

240
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,436
Up. That's it.

241
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,949
Same on the way down as on the way up.

242
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,839
Down again.

243
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,791
Good. One more time.

244
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,797
Nice straight back. That's it.

245
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,717
That's it. Great.

246
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:35,593
One more time. So have you got that?

247
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,597
I'll practise it at home.

248
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,995
Excellent. Good. Well done.

249
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,872
If you have any questions

250
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,117
or if you want to talk about anything at all...

251
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,117
I know you've um...

252
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,715
You slept with Jeff.
- Are we done?

253
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,751
You made a mistake...
- I haven't.

254
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,429
I'm just checking whether
you're going to be spreading it around...

255
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,879
Right. Bye.

256
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,954
Good.

257
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,839
Yeah.

258
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,076
Excellent pupil. Fast learner.

259
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:14,798
She won't be spilling any fluids
or lifting things incorrectly.

260
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,876
'A' I'm going to give her.

261
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,633
'A.'

262
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,119
Quick question. I've got these invoices
to file and I don't know...

263
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,277
Yes?
- Where do I file these?

264
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,595
I don't know.
- Excellent. Thanks.

265
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,309
It's not as if she's your daughter,

266
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:10,308
But that's not the point.
It's the principle. It was about respect.

267
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,874
Showing a bit of respect.

268
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:20,358
And while she's under my roof,
she will obey my laws. So...

269
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,392
Show them respect by being the law.

270
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:29,359
She's legal though. When cherries are red,
they're ready for plucking,

271
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,596
when girls are 16, they're...
- Gareth.

272
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,517
You heard that one.
- Well...

273
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:37,076
Are you going to fire the person
she shag... slept with?

274
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,431
It's a free country. I can't do anything about it.

275
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,710
So you won't fire them, as such?

276
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:46,753
I won't look on him favourably.
- Or her. It could be a girl.

277
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,277
She's not a lesbian, Gareth.

278
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:53,075
I think I'd know if a woman living under my roof

279
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,668
liked to roll around with other women.

280
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,392
Gareth? Don't you?

281
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,272
Yup. Most probably.

282
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:09,557
Spoke to you at five,
get the call at six from the lads,

283
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,557
drinks at eight in the Chasers.

284
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,796
Spare bird going.
- Not for long!

285
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:17,390
So I get there, she's aged 19. Ferrari chassis,

286
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,229
fantastic-sized shelves, and legs up to her arse.

287
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,874
Muchos tequilas later, I'm in a cab with her.

288
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,278
And my mate's bird wants
to get a lift with me and this nympho.

289
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,517
Finchy!
- There I am, back of the cab,

290
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:35,759
both of them with their laughing gear
round the pump-action rifle.

291
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:40,198
Got back to mine, two hours sleep, yeah?

292
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,752
Today, I bump into the mate
whose bird I've done...

293
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,189
sold him two ton of high white.

294
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,834
He says to me, 'You look knackered. '

295
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:52,077
And he looks like he's had
a Pot Noodle and a wank.

296
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,157
I'd have said that to him.

297
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:57,477
I shit you not. I'm seeing
both of them tomorrow night.

298
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,956
Coming out tonight though?
- Definitely.

299
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,752
Are you coming, jobless?

300
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,031
Yeah. If only for the conversation.

301
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,637
Pot Noodle and a wank!

302
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,880
I don't know
where we're going tonl'ght,

303
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,798
Obviously, Finchy's a sophisticated guy,

304
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,990
and Gareth's a culture vulture,

305
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,189
Will it be opera, ballet? I don't know.

306
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,073
I know the RSC's in town, so...

307
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,839
Having said that, at Chasers,

308
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:29,873
it's a Hooch for a pound
and Wonderbras get in free night, so...

309
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,231
I don't know. It's exciting. I'm staying out of it.

310
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:37,116
'OUT OF YOUR MIND'
BY THE TRUESTEPPERS)

311
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,154
Garחon!

312
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,270
Who wants a Finch pinch?
- What?

313
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,439
Chris Finch, good to meet you.
This is my friend Sir David Brent.

314
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:59,438
Joking. The only knighthood he's got's a condom.

315
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,913
Night-hood.

316
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,474
Condom.
- I'm saying the joke worked.

317
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:07,309
Condoms come
in all different flavours now, don't they?

318
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,035
Like strawberry and curry and that.
Do you like curry?

319
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,438
What are your names?

320
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,279
I'm Lorna. This is Lindsey and Heather.

321
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,119
Pleased to meet you. Nice to meet you.

322
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,231
And very nice to meet you.

323
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,715
Nice to meet all of you. Anyone's fine.

'SPINNING AROUND'
BY KYLIE MINOGUE)

325
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,513
Nice shirt.

326
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,471
Cheers. Ciro Citterio.

327
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,076
While you're down there, love.

328
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,476
You know what they say -
one up the bum, no harm done.

329
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,196
You not heard that before?
- Yeah.

330
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,552
Christ, that'll do.

331
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:11,717
If you're looking for a seat, you can sit on my face!

332
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,877
Not her. She's staying with me. Her dad'll kill me.

333
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,831
Leave it.
- You lucky bastard.

334
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,190
Hey, do you want something hard?

335
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:22,232
Don't. Do it to other girls. Please, just...

336
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,949
We go there every Wednesday nl'ght,
It's a fun place,

337
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,196
but it's full of loose women.

338
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,756
And my only problem with that
is venereal disease,

339
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,235
which is disabilitating.

340
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,756
Especially for a soldier.

341
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,508
And it's irresponsible to your unit.

342
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,517
You've been under attack for days,

343
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,394
there's a soldier down,
he's wounded, gangrene's setting in.

344
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,317
'Who's used all the penicillin?'

345
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:03,512
'Mark Paxton, sir.
He's got knob rot off some tart. '

346
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,992
Coming through.

347
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,318
R- aargh!

348
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,516
Don't worry. I haven't got any balls.

349
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,874
Vodka and coke. Remembered.

350
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,752
What am I drinking?

351
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,711
Lager?
- Pint thereof.

352
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:52,238
They're coming up to me
one at a time and going,

353
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:55,477
'Will we be made redundant, David?'

354
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,556
I'm going, 'No. Over my dead body. '

355
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:01,912
They're going, 'Don't put your neck
on the line. ' 'I will if I want to. '

356
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,838
They bend over backwards for me,

357
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,793
and not because they're scared of me,

358
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:11,037
but because they love me
and I love them. You know?

359
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:14,994
You'll grow to love me as well -
not because of anything sexual...

360
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,390
Hey, David.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

361
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,355
Hey, what bike you got?

362
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,711
A Matchless 500.
- Is that a Harley Davidson?

363
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,717
I love all that.
- Leave it.

364
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,908
Slough's nl'ghtlife is incredible,

365
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,156
It's got two nl'ghtclubs - Chasers

366
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,828
and New York New York,

367
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:59,953
They call it 'The nightclub that
never sleeps. ' That closes at one.

368
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,912
There is... There was... Oh, my God.

369
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:07,396
.. a themed nightclub called Henry VIII's, right?

370
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,557
It was incredible. It had the Ann Bow-ling Alley.

371
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,159
This is true.

372
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:16,512
As you went into the loo, there was
a sign that said 'Mind Your Head. '

373
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,599
And underneath someone had written
'Don't get your Hampton Court. '

374
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,351
Yeah. It's not there anymore.

375
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:28,356
But not a day goes by
that I don't think about it.

376
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,431
Who are you?

377
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,076
Have you not met my husband Paul?

378
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,474
Husband?

379
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,875
Is it all right if Gareth comes back?

380
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,638
Fine.
- Husband?

381
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:57,070
No way. No. I don't... Not interested. No.

382
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:01,034
I'm not having another fella involved.
Another girl, maybe.

383
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,196
I wouldn't even want him watching.

384
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,799
No way.

385
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:08,755
'TAINTED LOVE' BY SOFT CELL)

386
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,594
Hi.

387
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:39,110
Hey. All right, mate.
- How's it going? Good to see you.

388
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:45,233
So now you know.
- Yeah. Brilliant.

389
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,271
You got a problem with Ricky?

390
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,152
No. Sleep with everyone.

391
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:52,078
He's not even permanent.
I'd have preferred Gareth.

392
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,192
Wouldn't happen.
- 'Cause he didn't go to university?

393
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,390
No, because he's a weasel-faced arse.

394
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:01,479
You could do worse than Gareth.
He hasn't missed one day from illness.

395
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,239
And don't call him an arse-faced weasel.

396
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,157
A weasel-faced arse.
- Same.

397
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:10,239
Would you rather have a face
like an arse or a face like a weasel?

398
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,713
A weasel, probably.

399
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,638
Fuck this. Don't tell me who I can and can't see.

400
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:19,719
I hope you won't be sleeping
with someone if sex is so disgusting.

401
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,274
Fat chance. He couldn't pull in a brothel.

402
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,312
I could and I have! I'll take her home if I want.

403
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,590
I don't want to.
- She doesn't want to.

404
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:30,393
I don't want you to. That's wasted an hour.

405
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:33,876
Is that why you've been talking to me -
you want to shag me?

406
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,390
Yeah, and from behind
because your breath stinks of onions.

407
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,556
Whoo! One up the bum, no harm done.

408
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,511
No. Not up the arse.

409
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:54,196
This is the poem 'Slough'
by Sir John BetJ'eman,

410
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,151
Probably never been here,

411
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,594
'Come, friendly bombs, and fall on Slough.

'It isn't fit for humans now. '

413
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:05,439
You don't solve town planning problems
by dropping bombs,

414
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,471
so he's embarrassed himself there.

415
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:10,478
'In labour-saving homes with care

418
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:19,798
Why's he got a...? Doesn't he like girls?

but belch instead, '

421
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,475
What's he on about? He's never burped?

422
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,072
Where are we going?
- What? I'm going home, mate.

423
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,475
One more drink.
- I'm going home, David.

424
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,512
One more drink.

425
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,269
Don't do that.

426
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,789
