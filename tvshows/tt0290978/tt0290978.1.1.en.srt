2
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,072
I don't give shitty jobs.

3
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,599
If a good man...

4
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,720
comes to me,

5
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,195
says, 'Thank you, David, for the
opportunity and continued support

6
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,072
'in the work-related arena,

7
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,589
'but I want to better myself,
I want to move on.'

8
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:48,439
Then I can make that dream
come true to...

9
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,516
AKA, for you.

10
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,918
The point is you talk the talk,
but do not walk the walk,

11
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:57,396
vis-?vis you've not yet passed
your forklift driver's test.

12
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:02,036
The man who gives the jobs in the warehouse
is a personal friend of mine. All right?

13
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,791
I know you're the man for the job.

14
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,358
Sammy, you old slag.

15
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,071
It's the Brentmeister General.

16
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,589
Have you advertised the forklift driver's job?

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,276
Good, don't bother.
I've got the man here. He's perfick.

18
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:21,350
Has he passed his forklift driver's test?
He gives the tests.

19
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,755
Yeah, yeah. He's first-aid trained, yeah.

20
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,876
Yeah. We'll get a C.V. Over to you this afternoon.

21
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,640
i'm seeing you Sunday, aren't I? For my sins.

22
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,631
How is Elaine? She left you yet?

23
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,199
All right. See you then.

24
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,316
She has left him. I forgot about that.

25
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,233
David Brent.

26
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,593
I've been in the business for twelve years,

27
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,195
Been at Wernham Hogg
as General Manager for eight of those,

28
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,878
so putting together my team.

29
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,712
Lovely Dawn.

30
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,877
Dawn Tinsley. Receptionist.

31
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,950
Been with us for ages, haven't you?
- Yeah.

32
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,435
id say, at one time or another,

33
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,074
every bloke here has woken up
at the crack of Dawn!

34
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,474
What?!

35
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,957
Can I have the mail, please?

36
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,433
Yeah.

37
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,073
Just a fax.

38
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,710
Dawn, this is from Head Office.
- I know.

39
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,037
There's a special filing cabinet
for things from Head Office.

40
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,276
You haven't...
- The wastepaper basket!

41
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,271
Better get that back.

42
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,152
People say i’m the best boss.

43
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,635
They go, 'We've never worked
in a place like this.

44
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,877
'You're such a laugh.
You get the best out of us.' And I go...

45
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,673
C'est la vie. If that's true, excellent.

46
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,671
Be gentle with me today, Dawn.
- Why is that?

47
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,110
Oh, God, I had a skinful last night.

48
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:00,471
I was out with Finchy - Chris Finch.
Had us on a pub crawl.

49
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,996
El vino did flow.

50
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,473
I was blar... tered.

51
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,192
Bladdered.

52
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,193
Blottoed.

53
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,750
Don't ever come out with me and Finchy.

54
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,598
No, I won't.

55
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,074
You got to go for it.

56
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,998
There's guys my age, and they look 50.

57
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,079
How old do you think I look?

58
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,792
Thirty si...
- Thirty, yeah.

59
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,310
About that.
But i’m going to have to slow down.

60
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,158
Drinking a bit too much.

61
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:29,477
If every single night of the week's too much!

62
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,079
And every lunchtime!

63
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,757
How many have I had this week?
- What?

64
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,189
How many pints have I had if you're counting?

65
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,912
i’m not counting.
- Aren't you?

66
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,156
You seem to know a lot about my drinking.

67
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,679
Does it offend you?

68
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,717
You know, getting a little bit personal.

69
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,071
Imagine if I started doing that with you.

70
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:59,075
I could come up with something witty
and biting, like, 'You're a bit...'

71
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,709
But I don't because i’m a professional.

72
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,631
And professionalism is...

73
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,954
And that is what I want, OK? That's all.

74
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,993
That's a shame.

75
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,150
Wassup?!
- Don't do that!

76
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,909
All right. What is it, time of the month?

77
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,229
Just the eight pints for me last night.

78
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,713
That's all.

79
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,439
Uh...

80
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,871
Oh, no. Oh, God.

81
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:50,396
'Boss and team leader in drunken
night out shock horror,' it says here.

82
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,035
It's not like I'm out again tonight with Oggy.

83
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,232
That'd be a quiet night in at the library - not!

84
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,033
I don't think.

85
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,954
I'm a sales rep, which means that my job
is to speak to clients on the phone

86
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,595
about quantity and type of paper,

87
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,756
and whether we can supply it with them,

88
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:17,316
and whether they can pay for it.

89
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,678
And I'm boring myself talking about it.

90
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,594
Wassup?!

91
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,392
Hey, wassup?!

92
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,794
Wassup.

93
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,671
You're fired, Keenan. Drunkard.

94
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,079
Hypocrite warning.

95
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,712
Oh, God.

96
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,353
What's he been saying?

97
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,754
It's all true.

98
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,233
Guilty as charged.

99
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,749
Went out with a few of his mates, didn't we?

100
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,758
And he goes, 'Tag along if you want,

101
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,678
'but I must warn you, David,
they get a bit rowdy.'

102
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,634
I went, 'ill see if I can take it.'
I was worse than them by the end!

103
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,559
They're going, 'Who's that nutter?'
'That's my boss.'

104
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,319
'We can't stand it, we're going.'
They just left!

105
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,114
Oh, God. Absolutely mental.

106
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,393
Resolve!

107
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,674
What?

108
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,914
Nothing.

109
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,112
See you later.
- See you later.

110
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,514
Take care.

111
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:30,112
Would you mind giving Maintenance a call?
There's a nasty smell in the lift.

112
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,118
Head Office
don't really interfere with me,

113
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,959
Jennifer might come down once a week,

114
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,631
Jennifer Taylor-Clark.
We call her Camilla Parker-Bowles!

115
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,675
Not to her face. Not 'cause I'm scared of her.

116
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,668
I got them off Nobby Burton
who comes round with a suitcase.

117
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,837
Two for a tenner. Yes, please, four. So...

118
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:54,112
OK. Meeting
with Jennifer Taylor-Clarke present.

119
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,479
Right...
- Shoot.

120
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,750
Anything you wanted to add to the agenda?

121
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,393
Did no get an agenda.

122
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,829
Sorry?
- Did not get an agenda, no.

123
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,157
I did fax you one this morning.
- Did we get a fax, Dawn?

124
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,998
Yeah, we may have.

125
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,076
Then why isn't it in my hand?

126
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:14,796
Because a company runs on efficiency
of communication.

127
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,957
You put it in the bin
that was a special filing cabinet.

128
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,873
As a joke, yeah.

129
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,549
It's meant to be bills.
Doesn't really work with faxes.

130
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,671
Do you want to look at mine?
- Yeah.

131
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,078
Yeah, sure, she'd say she's the boss, but...

132
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:37,511
There should be no ego when you're pulling
together to do something good. Yeah?

133
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,115
It's like... Comic Relief.

134
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:44,355
Yeah? I'm out here in Africa -

135
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,550
I'm seeing the flies and the starvation -

136
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,352
and she - if she is the boss -

137
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:52,109
she's in the studio
with Jonathan Ross and Lenny Henry.

138
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,595
They're doing their bit counting the money,

139
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,076
but their hands are clean,
while I'm down here in the office

140
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,952
with little starving kids.

141
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,274
Right. Since the last meeting...

142
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,391
Alan and the board have decided

143
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,956
that we can't justify
a Swindon branch and a Slough branch.

144
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,752
Oh...
- No, David. Don't panic.

145
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,393
Should be good. Go on.

146
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,909
There are alarm bells.
- No, no. Don't panic.

147
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,190
We haven't made any deci...
- Don't panic?

148
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:20,471
We haven't made any decisions.
ive spoken to Neil in Swindon.

149
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,431
ive told him the same as you.

150
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,278
It's up to either you or him

151
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,676
to convince me that your branch
could incorporate the other.

152
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,234
OK. No problem.
- This does, however, mean...

153
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,954
that there will be redundancies.
- You see?

154
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:37,596
Did I no want to hear that, Jenny.
Redundancies are a tragedy always.

155
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,951
I wouldn't wish that on Neiis men
or on my men... or women.

156
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,709
Present company excepted.
Is Neil concerned about redundancies?

157
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,752
Of course, yes.
- Good. Because I'm very concerned.

158
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:51,157
Although I understand if they're necessary,
as a businessman.

159
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,077
Does he understand...?
- David.

160
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,875
Let's not talk about redundancies.
- We have to sooner or later.

161
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,911
Yes, but now we have to decide

162
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,828
if you take on Swindon's people
at this branch or the other way round.

163
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,520
Yeah, we'll take on theirs.
- No...

164
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,710
No. You and I don't decide.

165
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,717
I decide.
- You do decide but...

166
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,671
You make your case.
- Based on fact.

167
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,552
OK. Is there a time II'mit on...?

168
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,796
Let it go onto the machine.

169
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,675
Hl; mate, Not around at the moment,
so please leave a mess-ARGE,

170
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,430
It's Finch,
- Chris Finch. Bloody good rep.

171
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,632
Got a hangover, you big poof?
- Ah, that's derogatory.

172
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,069
You're in with Jennifer today, aren't you?

173
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,952
Give her one for me, son,
- Ah.

174
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,151
Cheers, big ears,
- Awful. Awful man.

175
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,633
Stop looking up her skirt,

176
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,034
David?
- I wasn't.

177
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,039
Can we keep a lid on this?
I really don't want to worry people unduly.

178
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,709
No. Under this regime, Jenny,
this will not leave the office.

179
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,315
So what does redundancy actually mean?

180
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,272
So you'd just go, would you?

181
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,957
Would you?
- Well, I don't know.

182
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,790
Keith and Jamie are having these little...

183
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,399
I know. They've gone mad.

184
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:59,398
clandestine little chats
about being out of work.

185
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,078
I couldn't give a shit.

186
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,033
This is Mr Brent.

187
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,032
Guilty!
- All right? Hi.

188
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,036
Ricky Howard from the temping agency.

189
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,673
Verna sent me to start today.

190
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,199
Temporary.

191
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,511
Staff. Only.

192
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,358
Ricky?
- Yeah.

193
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,754
'Ricky!'

194
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:32,069
'Ricky. No, Ricky!' What was his
girlfriend's name on EastEnders?

195
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,270
Bianca.
- 'Ricky! Leave it!'

196
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,913
Did she tell you I was mad?

197
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,235
Yeah. She said you had a nervous breakdown.

198
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,318
I haven't had a nervous breakdown.
- That was a joke.

199
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,954
She said you were a good laugh and,
you know...

200
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,957
We all are, aren't we?

201
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,991
Part of my job description now.

202
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,394
Unofficially.

203
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,112
OK. Let's get you started.

204
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,559
Into the fray!

205
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,670
What upsets me about the job? Um...

206
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,955
Wasted talent, yeah?

207
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,274
People could come to me and they could go,

208
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,233
'David, you've been in the business
twelve years.

209
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,830
'Can you spare us a moment
to tell us how to run a team?

210
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,838
'How to keep them task-orientated
as well as happy.'

211
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,598
But they don't.

212
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,158
That's the tragedy.

213
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:21,709
This is the er... Accounts Department.

214
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,199
All right?

215
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,393
The number bods.

216
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,751
Do not be fooled by their job descriptions.

217
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,916
They are absolutely mad, all of them.

218
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,999
Especially that one. He's mental.

219
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,988
Not literally, obviously, that wouldn't work.

220
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,352
Last place you'd want
someone like that is in Accounts.

221
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,517
This is the recycling bin.
- Right.

222
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,596
Obviously we get through a lot of paper.

223
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,119
We make a lot!

224
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,310
Actually, we sell it.
- Yeah.

225
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,998
It doesn't grow on trees!

226
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,151
You know it is pulp, yeah?

227
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,274
Yeah.

228
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,753
Mr Davis, can I call you back?
Something's come up.

229
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,472
Two minutes. Thanks. Bye.

230
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,159
What are you doing?

231
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,679
What?
- What are you doing?

232
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,075
I'm just pushing this stuff off my desk.

233
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,509
It wasn't on your desk.
- It was overlapping.

234
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,232
It's all coming over the edge.

235
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:19,316
All right? One word, two syllables -
demarcation. All right?

236
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,192
David Brent, I presume!

237
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,515
That's just to cheer these lot up.

238
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:29,717
Send the girls out to get the plants
to make them a bit happier.

239
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,956
They can sometimes get a bit...

240
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,639
It's run out of batteries.

241
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,639
Can we get some batteries for Billy Bigmouth?
Take it out of petty cash.

242
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,951
Can't put a price on comedy. Er...

243
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,355
You're a twat, Gareth. A twat and a knob end.

244
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,869
I'm not listening, so it's not offending me.

245
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,436
So you won't hear this.
You're a cock, you're a cock, you're a cock.

246
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,674
You're a cock.

247
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,279
Here y'are, look.

248
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,277
This is the sort of work we're doing.

249
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,114
Cartoons.

250
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,355
Does my bum look big in these?

251
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,515
It's not sexist. It's the bloke saying it.

252
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,551
At last. So...

253
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,319
All for that. All for that in the workplace.

254
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,310
Managed to scrape a first in the end.

255
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,873
You've met Tim, haven't you?

256
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,274
Hello.
- All right?

257
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,790
Oh, careful. Watch this one.
Gareth Keenan in the area!

258
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,988
Ricky, the new temp. Introduce yourself.

259
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,395
Gareth Keenan, Assistant Regional Manager.

260
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:40,239
Assistant to the Regional Manager.
My right-hand man.

261
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:43,432
I need him beneath me -
as an actress said to a bishop!

262
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,993
No, he's not.

263
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,793
Tell him about the car
and the kung fu and everything.

264
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,116
Yeah. ive got a TR3.

265
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,516
I bought it for 1,200, done it up,
now it's worth three grand.

266
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,313
The profit on that's just under...
- New engine.

267
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,954
A wreck...
- ive got some photos.

268
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,752
Oh, what is that?!

269
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,552
Whoa, whoa.
- That is it.

270
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:06,673
Slow down, you're moving too fast.
Solomon's here. What's going on?

271
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,870
He put my stapler inside a jelly again.

272
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,833
That's the third time.
It wasn't funny the first time.

273
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,997
Why has he done that?
- I told him I don't like jelly.

274
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,437
I don't trust the way it moves.

275
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,677
You show a weakness, he'll pounce.
You should know that.

276
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,756
What is in here?

277
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,154
My stapler.

278
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,998
Well, don't do that! Eat it out.

279
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:29,829
There's people starving in the world,
which I hate. It's a waste.

280
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,632
How do you know it's yours?

281
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,671
It's got my name on it in Tippex.

282
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,597
Yeah. Don't eat it now. Chemicals.

283
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,871
Right. You can be my witness.
Give him an official warning.

284
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,275
How do you know it was me?
- It's always you.

285
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,516
Mad here.
- Can't you discipline him?

286
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,993
Ooh, kinky!

287
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,670
The thing about practical jokes,
you've got to know when to stop,

288
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:55,156
and now's the time to stop
putting Gareth's possessions in jelly.

289
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,872
Gareth, it's a trifling matter.

290
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,478
Here we go. Always like this.

291
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,511
You should put him in custard-y!

292
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:06,397
He's going to fit in. We're like
Vic and Bob... and an extra one.

293
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,919
Oh, God.

294
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:11,589
Yeah. I'm more worried really
about damage to company property.

295
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,714
Trifling.

296
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,519
I'm just trying to think of other desserts to do.

297
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,793
Yeah, it's all right here,

298
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,913
but people do sometimes take
advantage because it's so relaxed.

299
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,233
I like to have a laugh
just as much as the next man,

300
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,430
but this is a place of work.

301
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,199
I was in the Territorial Army for three years,

302
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,471
and you can't muck about there -
it's one of the rules.

303
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,559
OK, dude.

304
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,955
Give it back.
- I'm just using it for a second.

305
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,991
It's got my name on it - Gareth.

306
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,758
It says 'Garet' actually.

307
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,678
Ask if you want to borrow it.
- You always say no.

308
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,392
That's why you should ask.

309
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,158
Gareth, it was just there, OK?

310
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,316
That's its home. Leave it there.

311
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,754
OK.

312
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,154
OK.

313
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,756
Philip, get that off him!

314
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,917
I'm going to let this go
unless you stop acting like a fool.

315
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,354
Well, you won't so...
- Well, I have, so...

316
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,478
What if that killed someone?

317
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,115
They'll think you're the murderer.
It's got your name on it.

318
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,559
Why would a murderer put his name
on a murder weapon?

319
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,352
To stop people borrowing it.

320
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,194
David.

321
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:32,357
I hate the fact you bring me down
to this. I really resent it.

322
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,392
I don't know why you're laughing.
- Leave her out of it.

323
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,954
You carry on.
Listen, you bring me down to this.

324
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,199
What's that?

325
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,632
Popcorn. Ben Elton.

326
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,876
Funny?
- It's all right, yeah.

327
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,915
I had a bit of a scare earlier.

328
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,194
Did you?

329
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,151
I thought I found a lump.

330
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:03,590
I examine myself regularly but... It's fine.

331
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,199
Terrifying.

332
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,753
Testicular cancer.

333
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,556
Cancer of them old testicles.

334
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,951
What's that?
- It's a bit of brie.

335
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,798
From down there?
- Mmm.

336
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,674
See you later.

337
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:30,635
ive just got a complaint
from a very important client,

338
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:34,309
saying that the figures
I gave him are wrong, and...

339
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:38,515
Yeah. Well, basically,
ive checked all other possibilities

340
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,154
and it's come down to the calculator.

341
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,318
Well, I don't know. Circuitry?
Who is this I'm talking to?

342
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,636
Redundancies. Now, it is true or not?

343
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,990
OK.
- Last in, first out.

344
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:53,908
I don't know what source
your little bird is... from...

345
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,792
All right. Give me a sum.

346
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:59,754
No. You give me a sum, ill try it out. All right.

347
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,879
Yeah.

348
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,274
Plus...

349
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,709
52... equals...

350
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,114
141.

351
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,037
All right. That time it was correct.

352
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,629
There's nothing...
- Be straight with us.

353
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,194
I am. I'm going to be straight with you now.

354
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,311
I can't tell you at the moment.

355
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:19,432
I don't like acting like a kid,
do you know what I mean?

356
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,994
But it's the effect he has.

357
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,233
What are you doing?

358
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,715
I don't want to have to look at you, Gareth.

359
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,353
You can't do that.
- Why not?

360
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,799
Health and Safety.

361
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,313
Why? Crushed by cardboard or what?

362
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,273
No. Number one, blocking out light.

363
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,472
Number two, misuse of company files.

364
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,238
Misuse of files? Right.

365
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:45,591
This is why the whole redundancy thing
doesn't bother me,

366
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,154
because if I have to work with him
for another day,

367
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,350
I will slit my throat.

368
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,992
You won't do it like that though.

369
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,749
You get the knife in behind the windpipe,
pull it down like that.

370
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,630
Or I could just apply for another job.

371
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,713
Careful.

372
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,073
OK. Um...

373
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:13,272
Thanks for coming in. This'll take a minute.

374
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:17,279
Er... Right. I am aware of the rumours
that have been circulating,

375
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,356
and I want to put the record straight.

376
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,516
I'm team leader! I should know first.

377
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,472
Yeah. I'm telling everyone now.

378
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:26,069
Just tell me quickly. Just whisper it to me.

379
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,668
Can you just tell us?
- Yeah. All right.

380
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,109
Shall I tell them?
- You don't know what it is.

381
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,549
All right. You tell them with my permission.

382
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,039
I don't need your permission.

383
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,549
Permission granted. You do as you wish.

384
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,914
Head Office...

385
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:46,595
have deemed it appropriate
to enforce an ultimatum upon me,

386
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,598
and Jennifer is talking of either

387
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,553
downsizing the Swindon branch or this branch.

388
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,270
Are you going to let her?
- No, Malcolm.

389
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,868
You didn't see me in there.
- For his eyes only!

390
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,912
I said, 'Head Office have got me
to contend with.

391
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:05,635
'You can fiddle with Neiis people,
but I'm the head of this family.

392
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,228
'You're not going to fiddle with my children.'

393
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:11,033
But, David, if they do downsize here...

394
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:14,789
You think id let that happen?
- It'd be out of your hands.

395
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,275
It won't be out of my hands,
and that's a promise.

396
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,118
Can you promise that?

397
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,673
On his mother's grave.

398
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,189
Well... I have promised it.

399
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,153
OK? And it insults me that you have to ask.

400
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:29,317
It's just that...
- Sorry. Dawn wants to speak.

401
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,318
It was just that I was
in the meeting with Jennifer,

402
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,478
and she said it could be this branch
that gets the chop.

403
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:41,232
Well, if you were in the meeting with Jennifer,

404
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:45,831
then maybe you should adhere
to the ongoing confidentiality agreement

405
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,313
of meeting.

406
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,271
Yeah. Information is power.

407
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,198
So you can't say
whether it's going to be us or them.

408
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,835
This is my ship and ive asked you
to trust me, and you can't go wrong.

409
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,349
It's not a question of trust.
- It is, Malcolm.

410
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,835
It is a question of trust. Do you trust me?

411
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,349
Do you trust me? Yes or no?
- Yes. I trust you.

412
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,833
He does.

413
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:09,230
So... Meeting a-journed.
- Good. Excellent.

414
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,710
id have said much the same. In fact...

415
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,831
Can I just ask? Do you trust me?

416
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,031
Hands up if you trust me.
- You don't...

417
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,878
You asked them.
- Put your hand down.

418
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,956
I'm Assistant Regional Manager.

419
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,640
Assistant to the Regional Manager.
They're gone.

420
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,553
I'm not worried for me. ill be all right.

421
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:31,036
But if there does have to be a cull,
then so be it.

422
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,435
I mean, that's just natural selection.

423
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:36,233
In the wild, some people wouldn't survive.

424
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,111
I mean, Imagine a warehouse

425
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,028
where a little midget fella is driving a forklift.

426
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,792
He can't see over the top.

427
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:51,038
He's got great big platform shoes on
so he can reach the pedals

428
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,151
because of his little legs.

429
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,679
Anton's a lovely bloke - don't get me wrong -

430
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,030
but should he be working here?

431
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:07,393
Have you got a price for matt-coated SRA1?

432
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,511
I can't see you, I can't hear you, Gareth.

433
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,918
Just tell me, will you?
- No. I can't hear you.

434
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,713
Just tell me.
- Give me a ring, OK?

435
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:29,069
It's on voicemail.
- Leave a message.

436
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:36,192
Hi. It's me, Gareth.
I need a price on matt-coated...

437
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,992
This is stupid!

438
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,111
Yes. This is stupid.

439
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,470
It's so... Sorry, mate, what do you want?

440
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,954
Er... I need a tonnage price
on matt-coated SRA1.

441
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:52,518
ive got 160 here, but I'm sure that isn't right
because when I spoke to Glynn earlier on, he...

442
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,152
Right. I know you're not there.

443
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,636
Obviously you can't hear that,
but I'm not talking to myself

444
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,035
because they're filming.

445
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,832
That feels nice, actually.

446
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,315
Do that bit with your nails.
- Sshh!

447
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,195
That's no different. You can't do
anything with your hair at all!

448
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,156
Oh, no, trouble. Sanj.

449
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,952
This is Sanj. This is Ricky.

450
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,071
Hello, mate.
- Nice to see you.

451
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:29,351
This guy does the best Ali G Impersonation.

452
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,519
I can't. You do it.

453
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,993
Go on.
- I don't.

454
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,475
You're thinking of someone else.
- Oh! Sorry.

455
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,273
It's not you, it's the other one.
- The other what?

456
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,470
Um...
- Paki?

457
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,874
Ah.

458
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,592
That's racist.

459
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,278
No, I don't have a great many
ethnic employees, that's true,

460
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,039
but it's not company policy...

461
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:57,470
I haven't got a sign on the door
that says, 'White people only2'.

462
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:02,151
I don't care if you're black, brown, yellow -

463
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:05,590
Orientals make very good workers,
for example.

464
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,950
Do you like a drink at the end of a week?

465
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,354
Yup.

466
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,550
Well, this is why we're going out...

467
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:14,558
When are you going out?
- To have an end of the week drink.

468
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,398
When?
- Tonight, hopefully.

469
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,794
Er, yeah...

470
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,592
Hi, mate.
- Hi, sweetheart.

471
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,915
Are you ready, yeah?
- Yeah.

472
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,315
Do you mind if I go out
for a drink with this lot?

473
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,998
No. Let's go home, yeah?

474
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:29,749
OK. ill be a couple of minutes
because it's twenty past five.

475
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:33,350
You should come. It'll be a laugh.
- No. You're all right.

476
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,833
We got to get off.

477
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,872
Um...

478
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:57,194
What's in the bag?
- Tell her ill see her later.

479
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,151
Certainly will, mate. Take care.

480
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,591
Dreaded first day.
- Yeah.

481
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,233
All right?
- Yeah. All right.

482
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,111
You've seen the vibe.

483
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,639
Chilled out.

484
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,431
Oh, dear.

485
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,073
We work hard.

486
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,952
I mean, we play hard.

487
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:24,433
Play hard when we should be working
hard sometimes, partly down to me.

488
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,834
Um...

489
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,918
I let them get away with murder
and they let me. The girls love me.

490
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,716
Not in that way.

491
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,114
But, er...

492
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:39,233
I suppose ive created an atmosphere
where I'm a friend first

493
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,716
and a boss second.
Probably an entertainer third.

494
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,193
Hold on!

495
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,629
Practical jokes, yeah?

496
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,159
Right. OK.

497
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,555
Practical joke. Don't give me away.

498
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,839
Come in.

499
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,952
And then Head Office said... Yeah.

500
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,911
Fax for you.
- Thanks.

501
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:04,589
Don't go, Dawn. Pull up a chair.
I was going to call you in.

502
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,711
I need a quick word.

503
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,994
Um...

504
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:15,432
As you are aware, there are going
to be redundancies.

505
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,631
You've made my life easier

506
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,796
inasmuch as I'm going to let you go first.

507
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,399
What?

508
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,874
Why?

509
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,274
Why?

510
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,833
Stealing.

511
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,279
Thieving.

512
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,872
Thieving?
- Yeah.

513
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:34,195
Er... What am I meant to have stolen?

514
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,878
Post-It notes.

515
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,513
Post-It notes...?

516
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,915
What are they worth, about 12p?

517
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,996
Got your Bible on you, Ricky?
- No.

518
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,997
Thou shalt not steal unless it's only 12p.

519
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,032
You steal a thousand Post-It notes
at 12p, you've made...

520
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,314
a profit.

521
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,237
Why would I steal Post-It notes?

522
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:55,432
To make the little things in the end of joints...

523
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,516
Roaches.
- Caught you, drug addict.

524
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,710
Are you serious?
- Yeah.

525
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,194
I can't...

526
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,719
God...

527
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,030
ive never stolen as much
as a paper clip and you're firing me.

528
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,515
And I don't need to give you severance pay

529
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,757
because it's gross misconduct.
So you can go straight away.

530
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,637
Oh, now...

531
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,638
That was a joke there.

532
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,555
Good girl. It was a joke we were doing.

533
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,352
Well done. Settling in.

534
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,357
Practical jokes for the good.

535
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,391
'Thanks for these. Check them out.'

536
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,832
Better do these now actually.

537
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,798
You wanker.

538
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,314
Come on.

539
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,870
You're such a sad little man.

540
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,474
Am I?

541
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,153
Didn't know that.

542
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:26,076
What is the single most
important thing for a company?

543
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,872
Is it the building?

544
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,479
Is it the stock?

545
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,759
Is it the turnover?

546
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,752
It's the people. Investment in people. Yeah?

547
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:42,112
My proudest moment here wasn't
when I increased profit by 17%,

548
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,869
or cut expenditure without losing
a single member of staff. No.

549
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,993
A young Greek guy, first job
in the country, hardly spoke English,

550
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:54,398
he came to me and went, 'Mr Brent,
will you be godfather to my child?'

551
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,794
So...

552
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,357
Didn't happen. We had to let him go.

553
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,391
He was rubbish. He was rubbish.

554
00:29:04,305 --> 00:30:04,423
