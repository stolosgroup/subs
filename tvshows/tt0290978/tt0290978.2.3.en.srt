2
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:31,590
- He's sort of...
- It's ten to ten.

3
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,234
- Pardon?
- It's ten to ten.

4
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,193
- I can't speak... Here he is.
- Hiya.

5
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,356
- Nice jacket.
- Whatever.

6
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,994
- Looks like mine.
- What make's yours?

7
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,156
- Armani.
- Expensive.

8
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,999
- And yours?
- Sergio Georgini.

9
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,113
New shoes as well. Quite a heel on them.

10
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,514
- We still on for ten?
- Yup.

11
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:05,917
People see me and see the suit, but they
know I'm rock and roll through and through.

12
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:09,590
You know "live fast, die young"? Not my way.

13
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:15,272
Live fast, sure. Too bloody fast sometimes!
But die young? Die old.

14
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,757
I'm not orthodox. I don't live by "the rules".

15
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:26,512
If there's one other person who's
influenced me in that way of thinking -

16
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:33,034
someone who's a maverick, who does that
to the system - it's lan Botham.

17
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:39,679
Beefy will happily say,
"That's what I think of your selection policy.

18
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:43,668
"Yes, I've hit the odd copper,
enjoyed the odd doobie.

19
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:48,396
"Piss off. I'm walking
to John O'Groats for some spastics."

20
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,549
(NEIL) You been reorganising stuff out there?
It looks a bit chaotic, that's all.

21
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:57,753
- We're assimilating.
- Assimilating what?

22
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:02,192
- Just taking on people and putting them...
- Into lots?

23
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:07,474
Yeah. Just categorising.
Not in any sort of like "label me"...

24
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,116
But just, "That's your vibe. That's your vibe."

25
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,918
What's in here, then?

26
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,272
Oh, my God. A leather basque. Fantastic.

27
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:28,589
I've always wanted one of these actually.
Cheers, guys. Let's try it on.

28
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,075
See if it fits.

29
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:39,710
You should try it on properly
in case you have to take it back.

30
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,037
Try it on without that stuff underneath.

31
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,196
Happy birthday.

32
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,113
- Oh, my God! It's disgusting.
- Even I'm shocked.

33
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:56,269
- You dirty mare! Does it work?
- One size fits all.

34
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,235
Sorry. Can I just...? Look at the face.
Gareth, look at the face.

35
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,398
- I'm not touching that.
- Why? Look.

36
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,070
- You don't know where that's been.
- It's been in a box.

37
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,272
- In the factory.
- Your amazing mind again.

38
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:15,758
In my experience,
women who work in factories are slappers.

39
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:19,032
Thank you for my lovely presents.

40
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:24,995
They're malleable... and that's what I like, really.

41
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,954
I don't like people saying, "We do it this way."

42
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:36,111
I just want to go, "Do it this way...
if you like. If you don't..."

43
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:41,314
Team playing. I call it "team individuality".
It's a management style.

44
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,796
- Guilty. Unorthodox. Sue me.
- It is.

45
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,869
But nothing ever changes by staying the same.

46
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,150
Quite literally.

47
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,636
- Hi, guys.
- Hello.

48
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,799
You like that.
Is that because it looks like yours?

49
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,599
Yeah. It's identical. Mine's not that size -
it's very tiny - but it is made of plastic.

50
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,758
Mine's massive and it ain't made of plastic.

51
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,308
I dare you to put it in Brent's office.

52
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,715
- Why?
- As a dare.

53
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:25,879
- He's having a meeting with Neil.
- That's the challenge.

54
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,958
- Why would I do it?
- It would make me laugh.

55
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,912
- I'll do it.
- I'll do it.

56
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,352
- Just hide it in there somewhere.
- Just hide it?

57
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,996
- Yeah.
- Simple. Couldn't be easier.

58
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,872
Straightforward.

59
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,556
- (KNOCKING)
- Come in.

60
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:49,275
Sorry to interrupt. I just wondered if...

61
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,437
I've completely forgotten
what I came in for. I'm sorry.

62
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,313
Come on, Tim.

63
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,557
- Get it back.
- Too many late nights.

64
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:06,992
Sorry. It's totally gone.
I'm holding your folder. Sorry.

65
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,715
It's gone. BSE. No more beef.

66
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:16,358
There's something you can do for me.
My lot haven't been down to the warehouse.

67
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,233
- Would you mind taking them?
- Not at all.

68
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,911
- There's not a lot to see.
- Everyone should know everyone else.

69
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,076
Tell Glynn I said it's OK.

70
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:31,479
Tell Taffy that I said it was OK
and Neil agrees with me.

71
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,955
- OK.
- Thanks, Tim.

72
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:43,233
That was brilliant.
Did you see it went under the folder?

73
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,195
- Gareth, out of ten?
- Three.

74
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,351
- Three?!
- Three?!

75
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:06,473
"You can't beat a bit of bully!"
"Bullseye"! Here they are. Likely lads.

76
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,478
- Hi.
- New shoes.

77
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,671
- Fashion.
- Do you want a game?

78
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:16,317
Yeah. "Up to the oche.
Let Tu-oni look after you."

79
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,594
"Two in a bed."

80
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,990
(CLATTER)

81
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:30,957
Shit flights on those. A bit fuddy-duddy,
darts, for a couple of young lads.

82
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,118
- Not young. 29.
- Over the hill.

83
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:37,278
How old would you say I was?

84
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,551
- 40?
- No. How old do you think I look?

85
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,434
- 39.
- Most people think I look 30.

86
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,632
- Definitely not.
- You calling them liars?

87
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:53,789
- What do you think?
- Well, between 30 and 40.

88
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,355
Yes. More honest.

89
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,949
(MOTOR WHIRRS)

90
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,798
OK. We're about to enter
a warehouse environment.

91
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,791
Some of the people here will be working-class.
There may be arse-cleavage, so...

92
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,391
Find a partner.
Hold hands. Don't talk to anyone.

93
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,353
Are you cheering? OK. Let's go.

94
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,991
Here's the hub of the operation.
Working hard as usual.

95
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:46,116
- All right?
- The stripper's arrived.

96
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:52,679
- OK. You get five minutes, but no touching.
- I always knew you were bent.

97
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:56,270
- She'll get 'em out for a tenner.
- Fuck off.

98
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:03,236
- What?
- Lend us a tenner!

99
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,194
- You won't see them tonight.
- It's OK. I've got cable.

100
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:15,475
OK. I'll show you this aisle first.

101
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,272
Bender!

102
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,516
(THEY LAUGH)

103
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,833
No! Get lost, you cheeky bastard.

104
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,472
No!

105
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:46,589
David. This is Ray and Jude. Ray and Jude...
Sorry. Forgotten where you're from.

106
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,237
- Cooper & Webb - consultants.
- Who's Cooper and who's Webb?

107
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,637
- Neither of us.
- I bet you get that all the time.

108
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,273
No.

109
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,675
Anyway...

110
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,953
First things first. Any more mail?

111
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,553
Mr D. Brent. That's me.

112
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,796
Come through.

113
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,108
Must just...

114
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,597
Shoot.

115
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,278
- Are you aware of what we do?
- No.

116
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:08,032
Basically, we organise training days
for corporations and individuals

117
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,198
who pay to get an advantage in business.

118
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,073
But it's not just boring facts.

119
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:19,798
We train them how to walk into a room
and say, "You're doing business with me."

120
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,949
I'll stop you there. I don't need anything
like that. I do my own training.

121
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:28,835
Sorry. No...
We're not trying to get your business.

122
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,998
We'd like you to be one of our experts.

123
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:37,755
Good choice. Why did you dudes
swing by here in the first place?

124
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:43,193
We'd heard good things about it.
We got your name from Andy Hitchcock.

125
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:48,474
Oh, God. Cockle. Cocky. The Big Cock.

126
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:52,958
Next time you see him,
ask him if he got the grass stains out -

127
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,196
not in front of his wife.

128
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,678
What sort of tip would you want me on?

129
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:08,237
We're looking for people
who are dynamic, good communicators.

130
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:13,389
People who can communicate
with young people - 20-somethings.

131
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:22,991
- You don't see heels like those much.
- You can still find them.

132
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,634
- What sort of bunce is it?
- Sorry?

133
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:30,399
- Well, to start with...
- Bunsen burner.

134
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,759
Bunsen burner - nice little earner.
Hence the...

135
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,992
Bunce.

136
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,556
To start we'd put you on about £300.

137
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:49,197
- £300 for an hour's work?
- You'd only talk for 15 minutes.

138
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,358
15 minutes! That's...

139
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:59,079
That's £1,200 an hour pro rata.
That's the sort of fee I'd be looking at. Yeah.

140
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,919
- When would you want to do it?
- Soon.

141
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,959
Count me in. Thank you.

142
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:11,632
- We could make some dates now.
- Absolutement. What's that?

143
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,910
- It's a dildo.
- Is it yours?

144
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,635
- No!
- No. I don't know... Sorry.

145
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:23,118
This is an example of problems.
Let's have a look.

146
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:31,512
OK, everybody.
What am I doing in there with a dildo?

147
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:36,714
She says it's not hers
and I believe her, so whose is it?

148
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,715
Right. What's it doing in there?

149
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:47,391
It's a birthday present, but I don't know
what it's doing in there.

150
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,478
OK. Good harmless fun.

151
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:55,390
Many happy returns,
but what have we learnt from this?

152
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:02,437
- Not to leave your dildo lying around?
- Don't let it out of your sight.

153
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:05,108
- (BUZZING)
- Oh. What's that?

154
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,950
Just...

155
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,594
Sorry. How do you...?

156
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,839
Oh, it's worse.
What do you do when that happens?

157
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,396
Can you make sure that gets back to...?

158
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:25,549
- Can we put some dates in?
- Sure. We're in the middle of something.

159
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:44,755
You've got to smuggle this about your person.

160
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:50,318
- I'm not saying anything about...
- If you want bravery, I'll do a dare.

161
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:53,478
- Bravery?
- OK.

162
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:58,479
I'm going to write things for you to say.
Come here.

163
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:02,753
Then I'll phone David
and I want you to say them.

164
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:07,112
- No. You'll make me sound like a bender.
- I swear I won't.

165
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,754
- No way.
- It'll just be funny things.

166
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,110
I won't sound like a bender.

167
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,072
- Hello?
- It's Gareth.

168
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:19,673
- I'm in a meeting at the moment.
- Yeah. Just going to say a few things.

169
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,438
All right.

170
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:24,996
- You're doing a great job.
- OK.

171
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:29,990
Just an employee saying
what a superb job I'm doing. Is that it?

172
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:33,351
No. I like your little beard.

173
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,317
- OK. Is that it?
- One more thing.

174
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,033
What?

175
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,997
You should wear tighter trousers.

176
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,714
- Can I call you back?
- Yeah. Bye.

177
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:56,353
That was genius! Genius. Genius.

178
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,352
Brilliant.

179
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:15,394
Our website has profiles of our speakers.
Can you answer a few questions?

180
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,556
- Go for it.
- OK.

181
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:22,709
"If you could have lunch with anyone,
living or dead, who would it be?"

182
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:31,119
Martin Luther King and the Dalai Lama...
and Rory Bremner.

183
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:35,950
Those two could get a bit heavy,
and he'd lighten things up.

184
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,197
Do impressions of them... and me!

185
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:44,038
"What's your biggest disappointment?"

186
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,152
- Alton Towers.
- Oh.

187
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,954
- I've never been.
- It's rubbish. Next.

188
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,756
- Hello.
- Hiya.

189
00:15:55,960 --> 00:16:01,796
- Still doing your practical jokes?
- Yeah. I'm trying to do some work now.

190
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,991
- I've got some.
- Have you?

191
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,156
- Yeah.
- What you got?

192
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,476
Oh...

193
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,830
I used to do loads... What were they?

194
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,393
We can think of some.

195
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,114
- Absolutely.
- Some new ones.

196
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,356
- Some good ones.
- For?

197
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:27,439
What about Gareth?
It's time he had some tricks played on him.

198
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:30,393
What would your motto be?

199
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:37,029
Some bosses are intimidated
by training their staff up too well.

200
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:41,916
I don't mind it.
I actually like my staff to be better than me.

201
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:46,750
That keeps me on my toes.
So my motto would be...

202
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:52,956
Be careful because there's always
somebody ready to step into your shoes

203
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:58,553
and do your job better... than... you...
do it.

204
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,994
Heh heh.

205
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,760
I'm gluing the phone.

206
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,277
- In the name of fun.
- He will hate you.

207
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,993
(ALL CHEER)

208
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,875
- What's in it?
- What's this?

209
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:31,517
- It's a little birthday bash for Trudy.
- Who organised this?

210
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,153
I did.

211
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,316
Bit over the top.

212
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:39,830
- How much did that cost?
- I made it myself.

213
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:43,112
- Made it yourself?
- Every year he does.

214
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,314
Bit sweet. Too rich.

215
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:51,354
- That's really nice.
- His lemon drizzle cake's even better.

216
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,516
I prefer a flan.

217
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,516
Whoo!

218
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,192
It's a pleasure to watch you. She's a prude.

219
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,550
- No, she's not.
- She is.

220
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,035
- Really?
- She's very...

221
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:13,556
- Not 40?
- It's true. Every time that does happen...

222
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,516
Are you in a meeting?
I've just had an interesting meeting.

223
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,188
Those two are business people.

224
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:28,794
They've got a business and they arrange
management training seminars

225
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,199
where they get expert speakers -
John Harvey-Jones type figures.

226
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,153
They've asked me. So... Yeah.

227
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:42,309
Perfect for me, because not only
do I have a natural authority with people,

228
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:45,273
but I'm an all-round entertainer, so...

229
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:50,114
Those qualities. Keep it under your hat.

230
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,552
See those two business people under there?

231
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,233
(PHONE RINGS)

232
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,392
- Is that you?
- Yeah.

233
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,114
Could have had my eye out.

234
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,395
- Hello. Gareth Keenan.
- Cock!

235
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:29,349
Thank you! Oh, glorious!
Did you see that? He still picked it up.

236
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,994
- Was that you?
- We glued it.

237
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:39,154
- Was that superglue? Oh, my God.
- Yes.

238
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,794
It wouldn't take much time.

239
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,709
I appreciate your interest, but I'm just so busy.

240
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:49,469
- What are we talking about?
- We want to involve this chap.

241
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:53,958
- You could have asked me. It's a bit rude.
- We'd use both of you...

242
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,151
- I can do both.
- I can't anyway.

243
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:59,079
- Can I have your card anyway?
- No point.

244
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,956
- We might be able to persuade you.
- If he goes back on it, he's weak.

245
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,559
- We ought to be going.
- Yeah. Leave as agreed.

246
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:13,912
- We'll be in touch.
- Nice to meet you. Bye.

247
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:19,433
You're definitely not doing it? I thought
you were trying to worm your way in.

248
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:22,757
- I'm not interested.
- Why? Beneath you, is it?

249
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:27,078
No. I don't think
you can teach people that sort of thing.

250
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,717
- Depends who the guru is.
- Beware of false prophets!

251
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:35,435
That's my point. It's not all about profits.

252
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:39,428
- I meant prophets...
- I meant, I meant. If only, if only.

253
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:42,916
If only me auntie had bollocks,
she'd be me uncle.

254
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,356
Every time in one.

255
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:56,510
- OK. Top Trumps. Pop stars.
- Pop stars?

256
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,995
- Do you know how to play?
- Yeah.

257
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:05,036
I don't talk about my love life
for a very good reason - I don't have one.

258
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:09,153
Which is good news for the ladies.
I am still available.

259
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:15,117
I'm a heck of a catch. I mean,
I live in Slough, in a lovely house...

260
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,519
with my parents.

261
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:23,350
I have my own room,
which I've had since I was born.

262
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:26,120
That's seen a lot of action.

263
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,276
Mainly dusting.

264
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:34,350
I went to university for a year...
before I dropped out, so I'm a quitter.

265
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,711
So, yeah, form an orderly queue, ladies.

Look at him.

267
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:45,234
I've been on safari
and I've never seen anything like that.

268
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,796
I've got 94. I have got 94!

269
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,752
I do.

270
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,679
Well, I've been known to do that.

271
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,553
- Are you complaining?
- No.

272
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:01,709
Number of haircuts. Is that a valid thing?
Are you getting mullered?

273
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,593
- Not really.
- You've spilt some on your...

274
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:09,510
- I know. Shall we carry on with the game?
- I wish you would.

275
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,915
Can I have...? Stop that.

276
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:16,272
If anyone wants to pay me that
for 15 minutes work, they can...

Chris Finch.

279
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:24,916
Finchy! All right? Go on.

280
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,957
What's the difference
between a fox and a dog?

281
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,639
About eight pints of lager!

282
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:35,479
It's party time here. You coming in?

283
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:39,116
- Why not?
- I'm already here, you fat twat!

284
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:43,836
- Neil, my good friend, Chris Finch.
- I know Chris. Nicks all my jokes.

285
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:48,113
I do not. I borrow them.
Has that Lisa moved up here?

286
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,754
No. She's looking for a job.

287
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,236
- If it's a blow job, I'll help.
- She's not desperate.

288
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:57,876
- I'll take her up the dole office!
- Dole orifice!

289
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,469
- Rubbish.
- I've got a vacancy she can fill!

That's better. His work. Don't try and...

- What are you like?
- Another one.

come to me. I've got five sets.

Don't try to beat me at Monster Trucks though.

- It's a game of chance.
- It's not.

296
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,032
I'd know which cards you'd got
by what I'd got.

297
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,198
I used to play it by myself with a dummy hand,

298
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:55,270
testing out which cards beat
which other cards, for hours sometimes.

299
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:59,678
Three or four hours at a time,
but the rewards are obvious.

I know exactly which cards you've got
from what I've got,

301
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:10,108
so I would know
exactly what feature to pick on my card

302
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,757
to defeat any card
that you could have in your hand.

303
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,996
You will never win.

304
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,435
It'd still be fun, though.

305
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:25,791
- Do you know what they're paying me?
- No.

306
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,958
Right. 15 minutes work, 300 quid.

307
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,913
- £1,200 an hour
- You do the math.

308
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:35,556
- Yeah. It'd be £1,200 an hour.
- That's the...

309
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,196
- Can I have a birthday kiss?
- You certainly can.

310
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:42,073
- No tongues.
- Oh.

311
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:51,188
Oh... That's good, isn't it? Didn't ask me
out of respect. Knows I'd say no.

312
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:55,359
Didn't cross a boundary and that's...
Good girl.

313
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,232
Go on.

314
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,872
I do it from behind if I don't like their face.

315
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:10,154
- Cheeky bastard! You like my face?
- I love your face. You're beautiful.

316
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:13,716
- You can still do me from behind.
- Ooh!

317
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:20,669
I'll do you from behind if it's a quick
in and out, no strings attached.

318
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:25,556
That's really sweet.
Why don't you put that in an email to me?

319
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,432
All right.

# One kiss, two kiss, three kiss, four
Five kiss, seven kiss, eight kiss, more. #

(MUSIC: "RED WINE" BY UB40)

323
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,637
- Birthday girl. Hello.
- Hello.

324
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:02,355
- You all right?
- Mmm. Great.

325
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,393
I'm just going to have a quick word.

326
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:10,196
I know it's your birthday
and you're flirting with everyone.

327
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:15,076
- I know you wouldn't take it further...
- I would!

328
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:19,239
- Why not? It's all equal.
- I'm just having a laugh.

329
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:24,912
- I don't know what you're after.
- A man! Hung like a shire horse!

330
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,237
Aren't they big magnificent animals?

331
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:32,228
- You say what you mean, don't you?
- Mmm.

332
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:36,194
I'm just not sure you're going to find it in here.

333
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,710
- I'd ask you, but you're a bit old.
- In my 30s.

334
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,956
Born in the '30s!

335
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:47,314
- I'm 30-something. I'm 30s.
- But you've let yourself go a bit.

336
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:51,479
Me? How about you?
You're an embarrassment, love.

337
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,715
- Bull rags?
- What?

338
00:26:56,920 --> 00:27:00,674
- I thought you said bull rags.
- No. Raw eggs.

339
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,350
If you keep eating raw eggs,
it makes you randy,

340
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:08,917
but it allows you to do as many reps
as you want.

341
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,908
- How's the old car business?
- All right.

342
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,475
- Who's this?
- The Corrs.

343
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:19,832
- They've done some good tunes.
- Didn't write that, though.

344
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,996
- Who did?
- Don't you know?

345
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,555
- No.
- Not into pop music?

346
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:29,709
- I prefer R&B. So who wrote that?
- Fleetwood Mac. I prefer their version.

347
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:33,515
- I know who I'd rather wake up with!
- Sexist.

348
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:38,589
- They can play my instrument!
- You wouldn't pull the Corrs like that.

349
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:43,749
- Like you know!
- Why are you laughing? I'm a dark horse.

350
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:48,954
- Like you could get anyone like the Corrs!
- Just 'cause I don't kiss and tell...

351
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:53,790
- You don't kiss, there's nothing to tell.
- He'd end up with the brother!

352
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,391
No. I'd push the brother out of the room,
bend them all over,

353
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:03,674
do the drummer, the lead singer,
and that one who plays violin.

354
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:17,274
See? Your fault. Putting filth in people's minds.

355
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,516
# So what becomes of you, my love,

356
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,437
# When they have finally stripped you of

357
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,949
# The handbags and the gladrags

358
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:50,517
# That your granddad had to sweat
so you could buy #

359
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,994
- My knees hurt.
- Nearly done.

360
00:28:57,305 --> 00:29:57,567
