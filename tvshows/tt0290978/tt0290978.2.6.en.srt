2
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,998
For you. Give me a call. One for you.

3
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,512
I don't look upon this like it's the end.

4
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:54,953
I look upon it as moving on.
It's almost like my work here's done.

5
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:59,312
I can't imagine jesus going,

6
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,719
"I've told people here in bethlehem
I'm the son of god. Can I just stay here?"

7
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,799
No. You've gotta move on.
You've got to spread the word.

8
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,753
You've got to go to nazareth.

9
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:15,748
And that's very much like... me.

10
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,988
My world does not end here.
Slough's a big place.

11
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,637
Whenve finished with slough,
there's reading, aldershot, bracknell.

12
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,070
You've got didcot, yateley.

13
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,194
Winnersh. Taplow.

14
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,199
Because I am my own boss, I can... burfield.

15
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,239
I can wake up one morning and go, "I don't
feel like working today. Can I stay in bed?"

16
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:47,719
"You'd better ask the boss."
"David, can I stay in bed?" "yes, david."

17
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,599
Both me. Not me in bed
with another bloke called david.

18
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,074
Be a bit weird for you when I'm...?

19
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,033
- Different, certainly.
- Sadder.

20
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:06,152
I am telling this to everyone.

21
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:11,275
I do not want you going, "that's it.
We're out of here. There's no point..."

22
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:14,074
- sorry. Can I get that?

23
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,512
Hello.

24
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:22,670
Oh, that's great. No. That's a load off my mind.
Thanks for calling. Cheers. Bye.

25
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,037
- Sorry.
- I want to... you know...

26
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:32,314
- oliver? They took the lot, mate.
- You lucky... you were bricking it.

27
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,476
I was, yes.

28
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:40,355
- All I'm saying is, I don't want you...
- sorry. Can I just phone steve?

29
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,312
Yeah. You're busy.

30
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:49,235
Steve. It's jamie. They took the lot, mate.

31
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,398
Yeah. No, it was a team effort.

32
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,353
Yeah. That's what I thought.

33
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,151
Here he is. The big man.

34
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,873
Ow!

35
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,199
Clumsy.

36
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,756
- Hello.
- Hiya.

37
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:33,111
- How are you?
- All right. How are you?

38
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:36,392
My mum and dad phoned me last night.

39
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:41,037
Basically, we have this beautiful cottage
in the new forest.

40
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:47,873
Once a year we have this family do, and mum
and dad wanted to know if we'd like to come.

41
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,594
Oh, I can't. When is it?

42
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:54,395
- We'd have a week, two weeks' notice.
- Yeah.

43
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,516
- It'd be on a weekend.
- That's tricky. That's the problem.

44
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,156
Well, I kind of told them that we'd go.

45
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,113
You told them? I wished you'd asked me.

46
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,236
- Hello.
- 0ggy oggy oggyl

47
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,592
oi oi oi! All right, oggy?
Keeno here on speakerphone.

48
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,756
- 0n speakerphone?
- Yup.

49
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:36,397
- Titsl who heard that?
- Everyone, you mental head. Shut up.

50
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:41,469
- You coming down for gobbler's birthday?
- Yeah. Jimmy the perv coming?

51
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,671
- Yeah.
- What about fish fingers?

52
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:48,635
He can't come because susan caught him
getting off with what's-her-face.

53
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,796
- That is mental.
- Yeah.

54
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:55,637
- See you later, then.
- Gonadsl

55
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,199
mentalist.

56
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,230
- Hear that?
- Mm.

57
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,919
Oggmonster.

58
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,311
Here we are. The madhouse.

59
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,158
Hiya.

60
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,793
Hi.

61
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,434
- All right, tim?
- All right?

62
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:26,510
What, her? She's writing an article on me.
"Inside paper".

63
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:33,632
Ben's... ben, are you wondering who that is?
Well, I'll tell you all.

64
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,559
If you're wondering who this stranger is,

65
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:41,595
she's writing an article on me
for "inside paper". Where have you been?

66
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,756
- Warehouse.
- You missed this.

67
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:47,077
She's writing an article on me for "in..."

68
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,236
subject matter.

69
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,272
Right.

70
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,550
What do you want to know?

71
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:59,719
- Do you mind if I talk to your staff later?
- Why?

72
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:03,196
I thought I'd have a chat to some of them.

73
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:07,439
- I want to see what they say.
- I won't put anything nasty in.

74
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,790
They won't say anything nasty.

75
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:17,110
Ok. Would you like to tell me about
your individual outlook on management?

76
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:24,556
Put... "brent is refreshingly laid-back
for a man with such responsibility."

77
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:28,639
Just answer in your own words
and I'll work that out.

78
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:32,799
Um... "brent mused and then replied..."

79
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,310
just say what's on your mind
and I'll get it down.

80
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:40,195
Are you getting it down?
I'm going to be pretty...

81
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,511
- just...
- well... ok.

82
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:49,590
Your question was "is it difficult
to remain authoritative and yet so popular?"

83
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,313
No, it wasn't.

84
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,796
- I'll answer that first...
- can we stick to my questions?

85
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,232
Well, maybe you should be clear
what the question is.

86
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,673
Ok.

87
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,633
- He said on the nog.
- Offensive.

88
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,308
- What's so funny?
- Nothing.

89
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:17,118
I was just um...
I was just talking to emma about...

90
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:20,710
what is that pub we went to on friday?

91
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,673
- Gareth keenan, hello.

92
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:27,429
Hi, baby. It's anne.
Are you coming round tonight?

93
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:32,668
- Can't. Going up chaser's with the lads.
- Come round first.

94
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,075
- All right.
- Have some fun.

95
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,716
- Ok.
- Are you going to bring the toys again?

96
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,113
Yeah.

97
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,912
Ok.

98
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,635
Yeah. Look forward to doing it to you, too.

99
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,192
All right. Bye.

100
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,635
- The toys?
- Shut up.

101
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,593
What are the toys? Is it buckaroo?

102
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,074
- It's not boggle, is it?
- Shut up.

103
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:06,558
- If it's ker-plunk, I'm coming round.
- It was a private phone call.

104
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,228
Don't put it on speakerphone, then.

105
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,716
Yeah. "the jolly farmer"... is it hungry hippo?

106
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:20,589
Private life. Just to flesh out david brent
the man. Is there a better half?

107
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,828
"David quipped, 'why buy a book
when you can join a library?"'

108
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,353
- So you play the field?
- Well... I don't use chicks and shit.

109
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,120
I'm just chilling out while I'm young.

110
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,313
- And is there a chick in tow?
- I don't kiss and tell.

111
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:41,557
Are you in a relationship at the moment?

112
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,558
"Brent says, 'no comment'."

113
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:49,515
- So you don't have a girlfriend?
- Well, what is a "girlfriend"?

114
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:54,316
- Someone you'd have sex with?
- Don't get coarse in a public magazine.

115
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:57,671
You won't win a pulitzer for filth.

116
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:10,432
I got this for my mate gobbler. It's his birthday.
We're all going up chaser's.

117
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:16,670
0h, yeahl come on, come on, babyl

118
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,678
- come on, come on, babyl
- watch.

119
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,509
0h... 0h... 0hl

120
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,188
0h, nol

121
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,876
you know gobbler, don't you? You seen this?

122
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,594
Come on, come on, babyl

123
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,234
- come on, come on, babyl
- watch.

124
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,956
He'll love that. He comes in his pants.

125
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,793
Do it again.

126
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,117
I don't give myself a hard time about things.

127
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,595
I'm 30 years young now.

128
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:04,954
I'm not someone who has specific goals
about doing this or that by my age.

129
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,594
"Why haven't I taken that chance?"

130
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,952
If you look at life like rolling a dice,

131
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,470
then my situation now may only be a three.

132
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:20,834
If I jack that in now, go for something better,
I could easily roll a six.

133
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,318
No problem. I could roll a six.
I could also roll a one.

134
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:29,274
So I think sometimes
just leave the dice alone.

135
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:52,431
That's why my professionalism
is only as important as...

136
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,952
- come in... my humanism.

137
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:00,311
Hi. I just wondered
if you've got time for a chat.

138
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:05,469
I've always got time for staff, dawn.
"He's always got time for staff."

139
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:10,834
- Before you go...
- "even though a lot happening in his mind."

140
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,314
Shoot.

141
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:16,798
Before you leave,
I wanted to hand in my notice.

142
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,197
Ooh, no. Thought this would happen.

143
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,631
- Who else is thinking of doing this?
- No one.

144
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:29,915
Don't throw your career away because
I'm leaving. I know it won't be the same.

145
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,076
That's not why I'm going.

146
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:35,238
- Reading between the lines.
- You haven't read it.

147
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:40,195
Is it just a coincidence you're handing in
your notice when I'm leaving?

148
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,709
- Yes, it is.
- Is it?

149
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:48,119
- Can I ask why you're leaving?
- I'm going away with my fiancי.

150
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,072
- Where to?
- The states.

151
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:56,037
Ok. Thanks. What are you going to write
about this? Ok. I thought we were...

152
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:03,076
getting back to...
"Strings to Brent's bow. A) philanthropist."

153
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,916
- hiya. Have you got a minute?
- Yeah. Sure.

154
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:18,069
When david goes, we're probably
going to do an external appointment.

155
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:24,196
We wondered if you'd do us a favour
in the meantime and be caretaker manager.

156
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:28,598
- Blimey. God...
- just doing david's job...

157
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,156
obviously there'd be acting-up pay.

158
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:37,718
That's really flattering. Thank you.
Listen, I'm going to say no and...

159
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:42,994
- it's a bit more work for a lot more money.
- I've got nothing to spend it on.

160
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:48,194
- It's only temporary.
- I thought that about this job!

161
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,073
- Ok.
- So I'm...

162
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:56,070
listen. I think you should
give it to gareth. Seriously, I do.

163
00:12:56,280 --> 00:13:02,469
He takes things seriously.
He's conscientious. He works hard.

164
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,398
0h, yeahl 0h, yeahl

165
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:10,232
he knows this place inside out.
I think he might be the man for it.

166
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,509
- Thanks, tim.
- Thank you.

167
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:19,395
0h, no... 0h, nol

168
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:27,071
it says that for women, the most
important qualities in a man are...

169
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,840
eyes, smile,

170
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,951
flat stomach...

171
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,151
- yup.
- Buttocks...

172
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,793
yup.

173
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,958
- You've got good buttocks, gareth?
- Yes.

174
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,720
- Can we see them?
- No. Gay.

175
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,671
Let's put it out.
Sheila, what do you look for in a bloke?

176
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,076
I like blacks.

177
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,711
Cool.

178
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:13,197
- Trudy, how about you?
- I quite like shy men, actually.

179
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:17,393
- Yeah. I understand that.
- Would that be yours?

180
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,034
- No.
- What do you look for in a man?

181
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:25,473
- Rugged good looks.
- You tell me it's a good sense of humour.

182
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,229
Yeah. You've got a good sense of humour.

183
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,396
Yeah, I know.

184
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,519
Rach, have you got a sec?

185
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,668
I just wanted to tell you...

186
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,755
I don't know how to say it.

187
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,156
This is so hard.

188
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:42,915
- Well done. She's crying.
- I know. Just leave it.

189
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:47,398
- Up to me to clear up your mess.
- Just stay out of it, mate.

190
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:52,958
You dumped her, so it's nothing to do
with you any more. She needs cheering up.

191
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:57,711
Don't take dirty bertie.
Don't... I beg you. Don't take bertie.

192
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,515
- Overruled.
- If you have to go, don't take bertie.

193
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,956
- Hi...
- fuck off.

194
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,916
Potty mouth.

195
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,995
There you go. So... stay in touch.

196
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,633
Cheers.

197
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:38,879
People can't believe
I'm this happy to be leaving.

198
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:44,632
Not because there's anything wrong with it,
but you know I did that thing at the centre?

199
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:49,038
Well, as I was giving that motivational speech,

200
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:54,553
I could literally see them all
getting all motivated from it.

201
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57,069
It's like being born again.

202
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:03,469
It showed me how much I had
to offer other people.

203
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:09,676
These are the guys from cooper & webb,
the management training consultants.

204
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:13,031
This is ray. This is jude. This is helena.

205
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:18,678
She's writing quite a big article on me
for "inside paper", the trade magazine.

206
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,431
I've mentioned our thing, so...
you don't mind if she sits in?

207
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:27,235
- Not if you don't.
- I'm coolio. Ok.

208
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,154
Hello. Wernham-hogg.

209
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,549
Yup. I'll put you through.

210
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:42,070
- I'll be in in a few days.
- Ok.

211
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:45,875
If you've got any problems, give me a call...

212
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,394
- ok.
- See you later.

213
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,272
Bye, dawn.

214
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:02,633
Probably wondering who they're going
to offer david's job too. Me.

215
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,592
- You got it?
- Yes.

216
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,756
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

217
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:13,399
You can start bucking your ideas up.
Starting with your appearance.

218
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:19,232
It's going to be a well-oiled, tight ship
around these here parts.

219
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,677
- What sort of management training is it?
- We...

220
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:31,318
I'll answer. They use celebrity speakers...
expert speakers.

221
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:36,958
And my personal tip is my rise to the top,
which gives it a whole new edge.

222
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,957
So... ok.

223
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,754
So where are we? Shoot.

224
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,873
- We'd like to thank you for your time...
- no sweat.

225
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:50,868
...but we won't be using you again.
- You won't be?

226
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:54,516
- Why not?
- It's not what we were looking for.

227
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:59,555
I'll do it how you... I did it like that
because that was the vibe of the day.

228
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,638
How do you want me to do it?

229
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:06,515
We have a very specific idea
of what we're looking for...

230
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,154
oh, fucking hell!

231
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:19,675
- We would like to thank you...
- yeah, yeah, yeah! Yada, yada, yada.

232
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,633
- Go on, then. Timewasters.
- We're sorry...

233
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,638
oh, get out. Go on. Thank you.

234
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,474
Wasting my time.

235
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,350
- Me as well?
- Yeah.

236
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,234
- Would you mind if I took a quick photo?
- No.

237
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,234
- I'm waiting for the flash...
- yeah.

238
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:04,030
There's a green light.

239
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,919
Ok.

240
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,918
- Right.
- Can I take one more for safety?

241
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:27,113
- Waiting for the green light.
- I know.

242
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,388
- Right.
- Thank you.

243
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,152
- Hello.
- Hi.

244
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,351
- All right?
- Fine.

245
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:09,798
Am I fine? Um...
I've just heard you were leaving.

246
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,120
- Blimey.
- Say it isn't so.

247
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,754
- Word gets around fast.
- It's true?

248
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,953
- Yeah.
- Were you going to tell me?

249
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,991
- God, yeah.
- You were?

250
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,156
- Yes.
- Ok.

251
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,749
Are you going to another job?

252
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:32,670
- No. Lee and I are going to go away.
- On holiday?

253
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:39,638
No. We're going to florida
for about six months. Something like that.

254
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,876
- Six months?
- Mm.

255
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:46,437
Lee's sister lives out there,
so we could live with her.

256
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,996
He's not happy in his job.
I'm not happy in mine.

257
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:55,354
- Is there a name for this?
- I don't know. Starting again?

258
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,994
Right. Starting again.

259
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:03,354
We'll just get our heads together,
I think, and... you know.

260
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,198
Cool.

261
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:13,350
Oh, god. Hello. The adventurer.
She's just telling me about the american thing.

262
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,757
Yeah. Me sister's over there. Got a big house.

263
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,191
- We haven't seen it yet.
- Seen pictures.

264
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,472
Her husband's raking it in as well. Yeah.

265
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:29,312
We thought we'd get a mobile home,
drive up the coast till the cash runs out.

266
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,318
Then come home or get a place out there.

267
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:35,080
- Accommodation's well cheap.
- Is it?

268
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:39,592
If dawn gets a job on reception,
she'll be twice as well off.

269
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:44,316
That'd be nice, wouldn't it?
Good luck. I'd better get back to it.

270
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,476
Cheers, mate.

271
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:49,035
- Hi, love. How you doing?
- Good.

272
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:53,074
You looking for swimming costumes?
Bikinis?

273
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,670
A real relationship isn't like a fairytale.

274
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,668
If you think every time
you see each other you're going to glow

275
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:06,159
or every time you hold hands
there'll be electricity, you're kidding yourself.

276
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:12,071
What about reliability, paying the mortgage
or someone who's never been out of work?

277
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:17,991
Those are the more important
practical things... in reality.

278
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:07,035
As I said before, when I asked dawn out,
I didn't ask her out, I asked her as a friend.

279
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:12,268
She was having trouble with lee
at the time and it wasn't like a...

280
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,519
under different circumstances,
something might have happened.

281
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:23,034
She's going away now.
You can't change circumstances.

282
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,876
Sorry. Excuse me.

283
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,994
Dawn, can I have a word in here?

284
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,519
Ta.

285
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:39,876
- She said no, by the way.

286
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,429
- You all right, david?
- Fine. You?

287
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,234
- Yup.
- Good. Small talk done.

288
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:56,514
Thanks very much. Everyone
really appreciates what you've done.

289
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,596
Yeah?

290
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:06,710
Ok. Down to business. That's what
we've come up with as a redundancy offer.

291
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:14,796
- Yup. More than I expected.
- We've been quite generous.

292
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,752
Bada-bing.

293
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:22,876
You can leave on the third with your holiday,
I understand, which is a tuesday.

294
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:28,632
Did you want to come back for a party
on the friday or leave on the friday before?

295
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,512
Whatever.

296
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,678
Ok. Well, again, thanks very much, david.

297
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,994
Don't make me redundant.

298
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,676
- Please.
- Look, david...

299
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:49,034
I don't want redundancy.
I haven't signed anything. So...

300
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:52,437
david, unfortunately, it's not up to you.

301
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:58,556
All right, then. Well, I'm asking. Ok?
Please don't make me redundant.

302
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:06,037
You can talk to someone, jenny.

303
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,789
- The wheels are already in motion.
- Stop them.

304
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:16,838
- We're not going to discuss this now.
- Say it's not definite before you go.

305
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:24,072
I will try twice as hard.
I know I've been complacent.

306
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:29,718
I'll turn this place around if you say
it's not definite now and then we can...

307
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:34,072
you're not going until... starting from now.

308
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,473
Life is a series
of peaks and troughs...

309
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:59,629
and you don't know whether you're
in a trough until you're climbing out

310
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,798
or on a peak until you're coming down.

311
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,197
You never know what's round the corner.

312
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,197
But it's all good.

313
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,357
If you want the rainbow,
you've got to put up with the rain.

314
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:18,519
Do you know which "philosopher" said that?
Dolly parton.

315
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:22,519
And people say she's just a pair of tits.

316
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:33,518
# So what becomes of you, my love,

317
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:39,717
# when they have finally stripped you of

318
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,354
# the handbags and the gladrags

319
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:47,759
# that your granddad had to sweat
so you could buy... #

320
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,668
hello. Wernham-hogg.

321
00:28:54,305 --> 00:29:54,655
