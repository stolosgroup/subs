I've not given up on going to university.

15
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:33,037
It's just that I've been made senior
sales rep, which is a great opportunity.

16
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:39,509
There's people coming in from Swindon,
which is a new and exciting venture as well.

17
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,155
I'm 30. I want to grow up, basically.

18
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,750
I suggest we put this down as a lesson.

19
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:52,988
Have this stuff over to me by three o'clock.
Three o'clock today please.

20
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:58,513
Then we'll say no more about it. All right?

Gareth Keenan. Who's that?

22
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,551
Oggy!

23
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:09,788
Oggy oggy oggy! Oink oink oink!
Oggy oggy oggy! Oink oink oink!

24
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,949
Oggy... Oggy...
Oggy oggy oggy! Oink oink oink!

25
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,036
See you later.

26
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,275
- Do you keep in touch with Oggy?
- That was Oggy.

27
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,233
- Was it? How is he?
- You don't know him.

28
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,238
- I wish I did. He sounds great.
- He is.

29
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,716
Could you
keep the pig impersonations down?

30
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:40,119
Yeah. I've told you before, you can't
tell me what to do, I'm team leader.

31
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:45,075
- I'm senior sales rep, so I can.
- Team leader beats senior sales rep.

32
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:51,628
No. My job title actually means something.
I got a pay rise. Team leader means nothing.

33
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,796
It means I'm leader of a team.

34
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,597
It's a title someone's given you to get you
to do things they don't want to do for free.

35
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:04,476
It's like making the div kid at school
milk monitor. No one respects it.

36
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,113
- They do.
- No.

37
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:11,952
Yes, they do. If people were rude to me,
I gave them their milk last, so it was warm.

38
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,033
Right.

39
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,596
Oh, no...

40
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,190
I found that in "Inside Paper".

41
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:49,316
It's the trade magazine for the paper
industry. My ugly mug on the front!

42
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,272
Embarrassing.

43
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,512
All right.

44
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,437
He's put me off what I was doing now.
Oh, yeah. Making the phone calls.

Don't...

Dawn, someone's
coming to collect that later, so...

47
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:28,709
Lee, I wouldn't get caught there, mate.
Top brass are milling about.

48
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:32,595
- I'm going anyway, mate. See ya.
- Bye.

49
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:40,876
Sorry. I've got to supervise everything
and make sure it's all...

50
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:47,076
- You haven't visited for ages.
- Yeah. I'm a bit snowed under.

51
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,113
- But you're all right?
- I'm fine. You?

52
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,471
- Mmm. Did you...?
- Your phone.

- Hi.

00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:15,598
- Neil is Jennifer's replacement.
- I'm David's boss.

57

- Just a little bit above me...
- I'm the UK manager.

58
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:25,273
I was David's equivalent in Swindon,
doing the same kind of job.

59
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:29,234
My branch closed
and now my staff are coming here.

60
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,591
So I'm David's boss, looking after him.

61
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:38,238
Looking after's the wrong term because
we're both... Good to meet you though.

62
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:44,390
- We have met before. Ipswich conference.
- Oh, God. I was a leetle bit drunk!

63
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,752
- For most of the week.
- Doesn't sound like me, does it?

64
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53,839
Anyway... Come into my boudoir.

65
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:59,114
- Ooh! Is Jennifer with you?
- No. She's on her way, apparently.

66
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,072
Part-timer.

67
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,432
Monkey!

68
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:10,349
Just an example
of the laughs we have here - for one.

69
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:14,517
Sure, we're in potentially traumatic times,

70
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,315
but they are exciting times with the merger.

71
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:24,834
Things move fast. Only two weeks ago, I was
telling them I'd decided to stay after all,

72
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:28,555
and you saw how relieved they were at that.

73
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:33,311
But we've had a personnel change of 25%,
people coming and going.

74
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,479
Redundancies -
some involuntary, which is hard.

75
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,559
I had to let my PA go. Last in, first out.

76
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:45,150
Which was really sad. That was upsetting.

77
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:53,475
I'm coping. I rolled with the punch.
Dawn can do a lot of it anyway.

78
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,470
There'll be time for this later,
but I'll give you some of it now.

79
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,797
Is that in your way? I'll move that.

- Trust Camilla. It's not racist?

At a Coventry conference,
some of us put on a review

129
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:48,876
and I did impressions of
the conference co-ordinator, Eric Hitchmo.

130
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,674
He talks like this and says one thing.

131
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:56,829
"I don't agree with that in the workplace."
I did him as famous people.

and I'd come out in a mac.

agree with that in the workplace!"

agree with that in the workplace!"

because there was nothing vicious.

would have been more nasty.

There will be perks. I'm sure he's looking
forward to having more men underneath him.

149
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:16,559
Here's the man at the top of the pile,
David Brent.

150
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:25,671
Thanks. What he was saying about me being
top of the pile of men - saying I'm gay.

151
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:31,238
I'm not gay. In fact, I can honestly say
I've never come over a little queer!

152
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:38,877
Get to the real stuff.
That was just... He's putting me off.

153
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:44,916
Welcome to Slough to the new people.
My name's David Brent.

154
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,079
I've always been in the paper industry,
haven't I?

155
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:53,159
My parents owned a paper shop -
until it blew away!

156
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,352
There's better ones than that. OK.

157
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:02,798
I'm not used to public squeaking.
I piss pronunciate a lot of my worms.

158
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,759
Ooh.

159
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:09,396
"The Two Ronnies". Classic stuff.
(PHONE RINGS)

160
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:15,118
Turn the phone off. If you're not
concentrating, you won't enjoy it as much.

161
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:19,871
Focus. Anyway,
good to have you all here from Swindon.

162
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:25,279
I hear they dropped an atomic bomb
on Swindon - did about £15 worth of damage.

163
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,073
Right. OK.

164
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,033
That's... Right.

165
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:40,549
Good job Eric Hitchmo isn't here. He'd say,
"I don't agree with that in the workplace."

166
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:45,880
Imagine if Eric was a Los Angeles detective.
It'd be a bit weird, wouldn't it?

167
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:50,471
"My wife loves you but...
I don't agree with that in the workplace."

168
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:55,549
What's that, Eric?
You've started running a hotel in Torquay?

169
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:01,471
"Don't mention the war and...
I don't agree with that in the workplace!"

170
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,195
I don't agree with that in the workplace!

171
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:09,279
You know Eric Hitchmo.
Who's been to the Coventry conference?

172
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:14,076
- Do you not know Eric Hitchmo?
- Yeah, but he doesn't talk like that.

173
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:19,035
- Yes, he does. Right, Gareth?
- I prefer your stuff about his little hand.

174
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:22,437
- I don't do that.
- You do. The wanking claw.

175
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,592
Has everyone heard of Harry Enfield?
Harry Enfield?

176
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:34,794
- Yes.
- Right. OK. Then, who's this?

177
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:40,470
"I do not believe you wanted to do that.
Only me!"

178
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,430
Oh, come on!

179
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,313
You try something and that's...

180
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,954
- Thanks, David.
- Eh?

181
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,118
- Thanks.
- Whatever. Just...

182
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:09,555
OK. There's plenty of wine and snacks left
if you want to help yourselves to anything.

183
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,392
Thanks.

184
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,148
(MURMUR OF CONVERSATION)

185
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:34,195
- I see you've got the wheelchair.
- I have, yeah.

186
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:39,679
I've got a mate who's got a wheelchair.
Not a mate, I don't like him much.

187
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:46,912
- I feel all right, yeah.
- It looks very smart.

188
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,873
Cheers. Thank you very much.

189
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:55,029
Sorry. Excuse me. Dawn.
You've been off reception for an hour.

190
00:15:55,240 --> 00:16:00,314
I don't know if we're missing calls or what.
Could you check?

191
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:04,832
Check the messages.
Is that all right? Thanks, mate.

192
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,634
As long as it's comfy...

193
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,513
Hi.

194
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:24,429
Lunchtime gigs are the worst.
I don't think Neil warmed you up.

195
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:27,757
He's not a professional comedian.

196
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:33,114
- He was funny though.
- An amateur will stitch up a professional.

197
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:37,757
Here's one I should have told you.
The Royal family. Christmas Day.

198
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:43,830
Camilla goes, "Let's play "20 Questions".
You've got to guess what I'm thinking of."

199
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,998
What she's thinking of
is a black man's cock.

200
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:51,193
Charles goes,
"Is it bigger than the bread bin?" "Yes."

201
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:54,198
Philip goes,
"Can I put it in my mouth?" "Yes."

202
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,358
The Queen goes, "Is it a black...?" Hiya.

203
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:02,434
- Sorry. Were you telling a joke?
- No. That was it.

204
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,074
What did the Queen say?

205
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:11,795
- What was the joke?
- The Royal family playing "20 Questions".

206
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,958
It's not the black man's cock one, is it?

207
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:20,188
- It might be, but... Bad, isn't it?
- It's all right. It's funny.

208
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,392
Harmless. Well done.

209
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:29,236
Have you all met this little lady...
this lady?

210
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,955
It's a shame this had to happen today,
but I've just had a complaint.

211
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:45,518
- What complaint?
- I can't believe you told racist jokes.

212
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:52,319
Wrong. No way. He thought it was funny,
so I don't know why he's complaining now.

213
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,954
He? It was a woman.

214
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:58,516
I assumed it was the... new guy.

215
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,156
- Anyway, it isn't racist.
- What is it?

216
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,635
- The joke?
- The gist of it.

217
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:08,116
- It won't be funny now.
- What's the content?

218
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,552
Royal family on Christmas Day.
Camilla goes, "Let's play a game.

219
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:18,198
"You have to guess what I'm thinking of."
She's thinking of a black man's cock.

220
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:25,435
So Charles goes, "Is it bigger
than the bread bin?" Camilla goes, "Yup".

221
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:29,269
Philip goes,
"Can I put it in my mouth?" "Yup".

222
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:32,438
The Queen goes, "Is it a black man's cock?"

223
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,633
He's heard it before.
So that's the sort of... yeah.

224
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,679
I can see why that might be offensive.

225
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,838
I don't say anything bad
about black people.

226
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:49,431
- It's about a black man's cock.
- It just happens to be a black man's cock.

227
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:55,078
You're using the stereotype that all black
men have large penises to make it funnier.

228
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,794
It's not an insult. It's a compliment.

229
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,233
Black people should be flattered that their
only achievement is oversized genitalia?

230
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,079
- They shouldn't be ashamed.
- It's a myth.

231
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:11,434
- I could show you a magazine where...
- Could you?

232
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:15,155
I haven't got it with me.
When are you next in?

233
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,192
I could just say big cock
and not mention the colour.

234
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:26,793
Or you could tell those jokes
in your free time and not in the workplace.

235
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,956
It was his joke.

236
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:34,109
Whatever, David. You've heard my opinion.
Shall we go back outside?

237
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:42,995
You ought to be careful because some
of them can be a little bit sensitive, so...

238
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,556
- Sorry? Who can?
- Some... people...

239
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:52,357
can take things the wrong way -
as an actress said to a bishop!

240
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:58,351
That's not a gay stereotype. I'm not saying
that's the wrong way. I'm saying it's a way.

241
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:01,552
Some straight women like it the wrong way.

242
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:07,198
It doesn't matter if you're gay. One in ten,
apparently. That seems a bit high.

243
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,597
You might be...
If you are, good luck to you.

244
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:14,554
Just make sure it's legal and be safe. OK?

245
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:22,719
That's it. A lot of people can't keep up

246
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:26,913
with what words are acceptable
and what words aren't.

247
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:33,639
My dad, for example,
isn't as cosmopolitan or as educated as me

248
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,798
and it can be embarrassing.

249
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,677
He doesn't understand new trendy words.
He'll say "poofs" instead of "gays".

250
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:49,158
"Birds" instead of "women",
"darkies" instead of "coloureds".

251
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,916
- All right, Tim?
- Yes, thanks, Keith.

252
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,873
- Hi.
- Sorry. I didn't mean to...

253
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,833
Your T-shirt's got "Pot my pink" on it.

254
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:12,998
- Play snooker?
- Not that way.

255
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,318
- So it's... Rachel, isn't it?
- Tim.

256
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,954
- Well done.
- Gareth.

257
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,991
Hiya.

258
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,713
Keith.

259
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,636
Thanks very much. Good luck.

260
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,116
- Jenny. You've met Oliver?
- Yes.

261
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:35,598
- Good lad. We were having a laugh earlier.
- Yeah.

262
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:40,112
- Did you like that joke I told?
- Yeah. It was funny.

263
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:44,393
- David, we've talked about this.
- Yup. Interesting.

264
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,875
See you later, David. Goodbye.

265
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:54,032
She should chill out a bit more. Maybe
a bit of the old ganja, know what I mean?

266
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,391
Course you do. Meetings would be different.

267
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:03,152
"David, I've called this meeting because
I want you to get me some Hobnobs"!

268
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:11,274
Like in Scooby Doo, all those Scooby Snacks
because he's got the munchies.

269
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:14,711
Dooby dooby doo! "Raggy!"

270
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:20,472
I was not advocating the use of drugs.
I was talking to someone on their level.

271
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,956
I can communicate with people
from all walks of life.

272
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,117
- Olive?
- Mm.

273
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:31,278
- Snacks.
- So when did you come up?

274
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,038
Saturday.

275
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,672
Saturday.

276
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:39,797
Was it your mum
or your boyfriend drove you?

277
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,037
- No. My brother came up with me.
- OK.

278
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:47,119
Have you got ties in Swindon
or are you starting again here?

279
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:50,596
- I'll be going back weekends.
- OK.

280
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,637
Sorry. So have you got a boyfriend or not?

281
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,956
No, I haven't.

282
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:04,397
- I think I left my drink over there...
- See you in a bit.

283
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:11,190
Tim, I know you don't mean to
but you're cramping my style.

284
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,517
- What?
- I'm planning to get off with her.

285
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,838
- And what if I liked her?
- I saw her first.

286
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,508
And how does that work?

287
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:29,629
You've won the argument doing that,
have you? Of course.

288
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,630
Everyone's nice.

289
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,316
- Hi.
- Hi.

290
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,829
- They came for the package.
- Yeah?

291
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,031
- No problem.
- Cool.

292
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,471
- I'm so bored.
- Are you?

293
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:00,638
Do you want to wind up Gareth for a bit?

294
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:04,276
I don't think we should. He's a bit busy.

295
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,632
- So?
- So am I, Dawn, actually.

296
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,796
So should you be.

297
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:23,515
- Is that where you're going to?
- Mh-hm. A few things I need.

298
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:51,593
Dawn. I've been checking my diary. I've
been overlooking something. So have you.

299
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:56,555
There's a 20 minute window here -
"Wind up Gareth with Dawn."

300
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:00,036
So shall we do that? Shall we?

301
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,760
This way, please, madam.

302
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:07,316
(GARETH) I'm not in the mood.
(TIM) Just a quick one.

303
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,830
- Did you see that film "Gay Lords Say No"?
- No.

304
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,713
(GIGGLING)

305
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:26,508
Sorry. Hello.
Could I have a quick word with everyone?

306
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:32,189
I'm mainly talking to the Swindon lot here.

307
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,632
Some of you seem to have got off
on the wrong foot with me.

308
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:40,799
You didn't like some of the jokes
I told earlier.

309
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:47,348
You've got to chill out.
Trust me. This is what I do. All right?

310
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:52,190
You will never work in a place
like this again. It's brilliant. Fact.

311
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:57,520
And you'll never have another boss like me -
a chilled-out entertainer.

312
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:03,556
Some of you didn't understand the jokes
and misinterpreted one and went to Jennifer.

313
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:07,992
OK. I'm a bit annoyed
you'd go to Jennifer and not me.

314
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:12,557
Who was it that complained?
It's not a witch hunt. Who was it?

315
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,910
Two of you. Good.

316
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:19,477
Why did you think
you could go to Jennifer but not me?

317
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,797
I don't know you
and I didn't like your jokes.

318
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:29,439
- You shouldn't be laughing at black people.
- Funny that only two of you thought that.

319
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:35,272
- I didn't like it either.
- Right. You're new. You don't know me.

320
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:38,517
- I'm not new and I find it offensive.
- He didn't.

321
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,998
- What's he got to do with it?
- He doesn't mind us laughing at him.

322
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,954
Why should only black people
be offended by racism?

323
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,632
Good point.
First sensible thing you've said all day.

324
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:57,789
I say, come one, come all,
we're all the same. Let's...

325
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,197
That's why there's only one black guy here?

326
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:04,358
Wrong. Indian fella in the warehouse.

327
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:10,112
And an Indian fella used to work up here.
He left. Didn't like it. Up to him.

328
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,869
I'd like the place to be full of 'em.
Right, Gareth?

329
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:18,392
- Well, half and half.
- You are half and half, aren't you?

330
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:22,115
- I'm mixed race.
- That's my favourite.

331
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:26,199
That's the melting pot. Please.

332
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,756
So there's your racist for you.

333
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,678
So...

334
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,992
- He said melting pot! Oh, my God!
- He did!

335
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:55,671
- He didn't actually do the fingers.
- Let's just get on.

336
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:58,030
Let's just love each other.

337
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:02,791
# What David needs
is a great big melting pot... #

338
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,513
Lee!

339
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,912
Dawn?

340
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,832
All right.

341
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:44,272
# So what becomes of you, my love

342
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:50,351
# When they have finally stripped you of

343
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,915
# The handbags and the gladrags

344
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:58,353
# That your granddad had to sweat
so you could buy? #

345
00:28:59,305 --> 00:29:59,374
