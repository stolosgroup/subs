1
00:00:01,426 --> 00:00:02,624
They're here to help.

2
00:00:02,843 --> 00:00:04,625
We need to get a
meeting on the books

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:05,746
about Alexandria.

4
00:00:05,789 --> 00:00:07,039
I have a pitch.

5
00:00:07,064 --> 00:00:08,413
I'm sure you do.

6
00:00:08,484 --> 00:00:11,143
Does Ezekiel know how
bad his chances are?

7
00:00:11,186 --> 00:00:13,362
He knows the odds aren't good.

8
00:00:13,406 --> 00:00:15,408
There's likely no chance
he'll get the surgery

9
00:00:15,451 --> 00:00:17,932
unless by some miracle
he moves up the line.

10
00:00:19,027 --> 00:00:21,544
There was never any Stephanie.

11
00:00:21,588 --> 00:00:22,738
Who is she?!

12
00:00:23,416 --> 00:00:24,472
Eugene?

13
00:00:24,827 --> 00:00:25,949
It's me.

14
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:28,332
I'm the one you were
talking to on the radio.

15
00:00:31,513 --> 00:00:33,299
It was just dumb luck, honestly.

16
00:00:38,316 --> 00:00:40,433
I found the radio
parts in a dumpster

17
00:00:40,476 --> 00:00:42,310
behind the municipal building.

18
00:00:42,742 --> 00:00:45,193
They'd never be left there
for security reasons,

19
00:00:45,459 --> 00:00:48,490
so someone clearly
thought it was trash.

20
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:51,565
But it wasn't trash.

21
00:00:52,887 --> 00:00:54,621
It just needed some love.

22
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,578
I have the most vivid
memory of an ice-cream shop

23
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:06,756
with the most marvelous batch
of black raspberry ice cream.

24
00:01:06,781 --> 00:01:08,174
The Inside Scoop.

25
00:01:08,199 --> 00:01:10,419
I used to go there all the time.

26
00:01:10,463 --> 00:01:12,904
Hell, we might've been
there on the same day.

27
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:17,114
Well, knowin' this, there's a
critical question needs answerin'.

28
00:01:19,115 --> 00:01:20,373
What's that?

29
00:01:21,314 --> 00:01:22,764
Cake cone or waffle?

30
00:01:24,024 --> 00:01:26,100
That's how we started talking,

31
00:01:26,504 --> 00:01:30,022
and we talked about everything.

32
00:01:30,755 --> 00:01:32,960
Everything and nothing.

33
00:01:33,121 --> 00:01:34,470
I just can't help but believe

34
00:01:34,495 --> 00:01:36,886
that this is a celestially
ordained meet-and-greet.

35
00:01:36,911 --> 00:01:38,762
No bean-spillage here, either.

36
00:01:40,178 --> 00:01:43,224
But, Eugene, my people
are uber cautious.

37
00:01:43,587 --> 00:01:45,699
And if we're close...

38
00:01:45,857 --> 00:01:48,468
I never thought about
leaving this place before.

39
00:01:48,645 --> 00:01:49,951
Well, I-I did,

40
00:01:49,976 --> 00:01:53,153
but I never let myself
believe it was possible.

41
00:01:53,508 --> 00:01:56,347
Truth is, Stephanie, I'd just
very much like to meet you.

42
00:01:56,606 --> 00:01:58,285
But then my brother
got involved,

43
00:01:59,754 --> 00:02:03,023
and he was not happy.

44
00:02:03,062 --> 00:02:04,109
God damn it.

45
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:05,909
It's not what you think.

46
00:02:05,953 --> 00:02:07,261
Oh, yeah?

47
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:10,351
Wanna know what I did today?

48
00:02:10,585 --> 00:02:13,652
I investigated a massive
communications breach.

49
00:02:14,842 --> 00:02:17,965
Apparently, someone on an
unauthorized radio station

50
00:02:18,008 --> 00:02:19,918
has been talking to
a rogue community

51
00:02:19,943 --> 00:02:21,436
outside of our walls.

52
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,991
Well, then.

53
00:02:23,108 --> 00:02:24,631
Hornsby's all over it.

54
00:02:26,978 --> 00:02:28,386
Tell me it wasn't you.

55
00:02:30,234 --> 00:02:32,675
Please tell me that you
were not about to sneak out

56
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:35,097
to meet some stranger
at a rail yard.

57
00:02:35,351 --> 00:02:36,620
What could I say?

58
00:02:36,818 --> 00:02:38,188
Max,

59
00:02:39,585 --> 00:02:40,874
it's dangerous.

60
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,656
For everyone at
the Commonwealth,

61
00:02:43,681 --> 00:02:45,453
but especially for me and you.

62
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,308
I gotta go.

63
00:02:54,837 --> 00:02:58,126
You better pray Hornsby doesn't
realize that was your voice.

64
00:02:58,445 --> 00:03:00,100
I knew I'd crossed a line.

65
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,642
And with Hornsby on the prowl,

66
00:03:03,136 --> 00:03:05,499
getting out to see
you was impossible.

67
00:03:08,201 --> 00:03:10,339
And then you turn up
with some other girl

68
00:03:10,364 --> 00:03:12,250
calling herself Stephanie.

69
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:15,070
Using my words

70
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,364
my voice.

71
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,074

72
00:03:26,153 --> 00:03:27,355
Excuse me.

73
00:03:29,727 --> 00:03:31,965
That wouldn't happen to be
Rocky Road there, would it?

74
00:03:48,872 --> 00:03:50,905
You seemed so happy...

75
00:03:52,702 --> 00:03:54,399
So, I kept my head down.

76
00:03:55,826 --> 00:03:58,138
I didn't know what else to do.

77
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,802
Thank you, Max. Mm.

78
00:04:04,697 --> 00:04:07,217
Can I get you anything else?

79
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:09,685
Ice cream? Tea?

80
00:04:09,725 --> 00:04:12,598
A day without my son acting
like a little asshole?

81
00:04:14,119 --> 00:04:15,709
I'll get you that ice cream.

82
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:18,405
Oh, and, Max?

83
00:04:18,614 --> 00:04:21,225
Have the bank cut off
Sebastian's line of credit.

84
00:04:21,354 --> 00:04:23,109
Maybe that'll whip
him into shape.

85
00:04:26,076 --> 00:04:27,098
I've got news.

86
00:04:27,123 --> 00:04:28,638
Then Hornsby came
to see Pamela...

87
00:04:28,663 --> 00:04:29,795
That guy from the comms
breach? Finally admitted,

88
00:04:29,819 --> 00:04:33,448
and he was buzzing about
you and Alexandria.

89
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:35,363
I never... What's he planning?

90
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:40,385
I don't know.

91
00:04:42,069 --> 00:04:43,596
He's ambitious.

92
00:04:45,154 --> 00:04:46,590
Could mean anything.

93
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:49,839
Could mean nothing...
Just the rebuild.

94
00:04:54,278 --> 00:04:56,574
The big guy in the orange
armor who hates me.

95
00:04:59,137 --> 00:05:00,409
That's your brother?

96
00:05:01,598 --> 00:05:03,122
Yes, but, Eugene...

97
00:05:03,147 --> 00:05:04,269
And you...

98
00:05:06,058 --> 00:05:07,199
You're Stephanie?

99
00:05:08,727 --> 00:05:09,789
No.

100
00:05:10,406 --> 00:05:11,577
I'm Max.

101
00:05:12,609 --> 00:05:14,073
There is no Stephanie.

102
00:05:16,386 --> 00:05:17,990
Well, it was my
mother's name, really...

103
00:05:18,015 --> 00:05:19,146
I-I-I'm sorry. So...

104
00:05:19,171 --> 00:05:20,193
I'm sorry.

105
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:38,673

106
00:06:26,925 --> 00:06:28,885
Pamela: This is a long
way from home, Lance.

107
00:06:29,393 --> 00:06:30,425
It is.

108
00:06:30,607 --> 00:06:32,662
But these communities
are perfect

109
00:06:32,694 --> 00:06:33,793
for what we're envisioning.

110
00:06:33,818 --> 00:06:35,178
What you're envisioning.

111
00:06:35,404 --> 00:06:38,443
I'm not convinced we need to
stretch our resources like this.

112
00:06:38,656 --> 00:06:41,282
Grow your empire further
than your power can extend

113
00:06:41,307 --> 00:06:42,482
and lose your empire.

114
00:06:43,255 --> 00:06:44,833
I don't think it's
quite that dramatic.

115
00:06:44,977 --> 00:06:46,647
Well, how's this for dramatic?

116
00:06:46,776 --> 00:06:48,735
If this doesn't go
well, we're out.

117
00:06:48,903 --> 00:06:50,862
These people are free to
stay with us permanently

118
00:06:50,887 --> 00:06:53,238
or they can go home and
finish their own repairs.

119
00:06:53,647 --> 00:06:55,876
There's enough to do at
home without having to worry

120
00:06:55,901 --> 00:06:58,780
about a couple of small
communities in another state.

121
00:06:58,929 --> 00:07:00,389
Give it a chance, Pamela.

122
00:07:01,114 --> 00:07:02,920
I really think you
might be surprised.

123
00:07:15,294 --> 00:07:16,499
Let's wrap it up, okay?

124
00:07:16,524 --> 00:07:17,599
They're coming.

125
00:07:19,681 --> 00:07:20,849
Hey.

126
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:24,671
Hey, cover that window.

127
00:07:46,598 --> 00:07:47,686
Aaron: Hello there.

128
00:07:47,987 --> 00:07:49,042
Welcome.

129
00:07:50,873 --> 00:07:53,572
Aaron. Pamela Milton.

130
00:07:53,903 --> 00:07:55,066
A pleasure.

131
00:07:55,313 --> 00:07:57,184
Uh, care for the grand tour?

132
00:07:57,366 --> 00:07:58,673
I would expect nothing less.

133
00:07:58,698 --> 00:07:59,702
Okay.

134
00:08:00,558 --> 00:08:02,478
Uh, Alexandria

135
00:08:02,503 --> 00:08:05,788
was a self-sustaining
ecological community.

136
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:10,803
We have water, solar panels,
and, uh, a crop system.

137
00:08:10,828 --> 00:08:12,221
Who is the engineer?

138
00:08:12,246 --> 00:08:13,581
I don't recall
anyone from intake.

139
00:08:13,606 --> 00:08:14,777
Uh, no one, actually.

140
00:08:14,802 --> 00:08:17,038
We got the plans from the
leader of an allied community.

141
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:18,371
Maggie Rhee.

142
00:08:18,396 --> 00:08:20,259
Uh, some of our people
studied the blueprints,

143
00:08:20,283 --> 00:08:21,465
and we built it.

144
00:08:21,818 --> 00:08:22,926
Fascinating.

145
00:08:23,254 --> 00:08:25,090
Mercer: How do you keep
a place like this safe

146
00:08:25,114 --> 00:08:26,590
with it being so isolated?

147
00:08:26,717 --> 00:08:27,956
Wasn't easy.

148
00:08:28,408 --> 00:08:29,847
Fought a lot of fights.

149
00:08:31,381 --> 00:08:33,121
You were one of
the leaders here?

150
00:08:34,056 --> 00:08:36,136
Yeah, yeah, I guess
you could say that.

151
00:08:36,454 --> 00:08:37,672
We all were.

152
00:08:39,788 --> 00:08:41,355
What'd you do before all this?

153
00:08:42,888 --> 00:08:43,997
Doesn't matter.

154
00:08:45,154 --> 00:08:46,720
Least, not to us, anyway.

155
00:08:50,674 --> 00:08:52,066
Pamela: Mm.

156
00:08:53,418 --> 00:08:55,202
She looks just how
I remember her.

157
00:08:58,443 --> 00:08:59,723
What, you knew her?

158
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:03,756
Oh, we used to cross
paths quite a bit in

159
00:09:03,781 --> 00:09:06,081
philanthropy circles
back in the day.

160
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,059
But I had no interest
in politics at the time.

161
00:09:09,379 --> 00:09:12,306
She, however, was
born to run things.

162
00:09:14,117 --> 00:09:15,510
What was she like as a leader?

163
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:19,415
She brought us in.

164
00:09:20,777 --> 00:09:22,736
We'd never met anybody
like that before.

165
00:09:23,594 --> 00:09:24,943
You admire her.

166
00:09:25,173 --> 00:09:27,089
Yeah. Very much so.

167
00:09:29,603 --> 00:09:31,550
I mean, she built
all this for us.

168
00:09:33,067 --> 00:09:34,636
Something worth fighting for.

169
00:09:36,217 --> 00:09:37,440
But it fell.

170
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:39,625
Yeah, but we always
brought it right back.

171
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:42,465
It fell more than once?

172
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:45,720
Yeah.
Mercer: We've got a breach.

173
00:09:46,457 --> 00:09:47,597
Stay here, ma'am.

174
00:09:48,773 --> 00:09:49,776
I got it.

175
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:55,949
Shit.

176
00:10:04,063 --> 00:10:05,888
How did you lose Deanna?

177
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:08,590
She was bitten.

178
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,466
Did she turn?

179
00:10:12,797 --> 00:10:14,581
We had to put her down. Yes.

180
00:10:21,678 --> 00:10:23,202
I think I've seen enough here.

181
00:10:30,822 --> 00:10:33,041
Tomi: Morning, Ezekiel. Jerry.

182
00:10:33,576 --> 00:10:35,465
And a good morning
to you, too, sir.

183
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:37,059
Mm. Okay, let's get into it.

184
00:10:37,084 --> 00:10:39,865
So nothing but water morning of.

185
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,153
No food. No solids.

186
00:10:41,178 --> 00:10:42,960
We need you on an empty stomach.

187
00:10:43,982 --> 00:10:45,069
Sorry?

188
00:10:45,094 --> 00:10:47,053
Doc, we're just here
for a routine check-up.

189
00:10:48,302 --> 00:10:50,043
Theo: I was told this
is pre-op blood work.

190
00:10:50,068 --> 00:10:51,896
To make sure he's stable
enough for the surgery.

191
00:10:51,921 --> 00:10:53,001
Surgery?

192
00:10:53,026 --> 00:10:54,462
To take out this tumor.

193
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,381
Did no one tell you?

194
00:10:56,652 --> 00:10:57,763
Whoa.

195
00:10:59,563 --> 00:11:01,379
I thought I was
still on the list.

196
00:11:01,691 --> 00:11:04,503
Well, now you're at
the top of that list.

197
00:11:05,042 --> 00:11:06,149
Theo: You're lucky.

198
00:11:06,513 --> 00:11:07,948
Some people wait years.

199
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:10,948
Jerry: What about his bill?

200
00:11:11,082 --> 00:11:12,099
He's paid up.

201
00:11:13,031 --> 00:11:16,255
Well, however it came
to pass, I'm thrilled.

202
00:11:16,545 --> 00:11:18,711
We're going to take good
care of you, Ezekiel.

203
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:20,297
Rest up.

204
00:11:20,623 --> 00:11:22,191
See you Friday at nine.

205
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:36,595
This is so frickin' awesome!

206
00:11:38,414 --> 00:11:40,020
Whoa... What is it?

207
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:44,794
How did this happen?

208
00:11:44,825 --> 00:11:46,871
Oh, come on, boss,
this is good news.

209
00:11:46,896 --> 00:11:49,141
Maybe it's a coincidence.
Maybe it's a clerical error.

210
00:11:49,174 --> 00:11:51,520
Maybe it's divine
intervention. Either way,

211
00:11:51,652 --> 00:11:53,445
don't you think you
deserve a little luck?

212
00:12:13,638 --> 00:12:14,698
Hornsby: Pamela.

213
00:12:18,778 --> 00:12:19,778
Pamela.

214
00:12:21,227 --> 00:12:22,363
Rachel's ready for you.

215
00:12:30,033 --> 00:12:31,879
You're blessed to have
this at your door step.

216
00:12:32,602 --> 00:12:33,654
We know.

217
00:12:34,889 --> 00:12:36,799
I heard how
Oceanside came to be.

218
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:40,261
About your battles with the
Saviors and the Whisperers.

219
00:12:40,775 --> 00:12:43,511
Says a lot about strength
of your community.

220
00:12:44,072 --> 00:12:46,400
I'm excited to have you as
partners of the Commonwealth.

221
00:12:47,386 --> 00:12:49,792
Aaron mentioned there
was a trade provision

222
00:12:49,817 --> 00:12:51,473
that you'd like worked
into our agreement.

223
00:12:53,321 --> 00:12:54,462
Something wrong?

224
00:12:54,895 --> 00:12:57,548
We spoke to Maggie Rhee.
The leader of Hilltop.

225
00:12:57,573 --> 00:12:59,387
She told us she's not
partnered with you all.

226
00:13:00,677 --> 00:13:02,587
We offered Hilltop
the same agreement

227
00:13:02,612 --> 00:13:04,832
as with Alexandria,
but Maggie declined.

228
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,012
Alexandria's gone
its own way before.

229
00:13:08,243 --> 00:13:11,668
But Hilltop and Maggie have
always been there for us.

230
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:13,950
We renewed our mutual
protection pact,

231
00:13:13,975 --> 00:13:15,193
and I'm gonna honor it.

232
00:13:15,315 --> 00:13:17,161
If Maggie decides
to partner with you,

233
00:13:17,378 --> 00:13:18,911
we will, too, out
of respect for her.

234
00:13:18,936 --> 00:13:22,069
Otherwise, Oceanside's a "no."

235
00:13:26,968 --> 00:13:29,623
Question... what was the
point of bringing you along

236
00:13:29,648 --> 00:13:31,206
if you can't give
me any helpful Intel

237
00:13:31,246 --> 00:13:33,571
in advance of shit
blowing up in our faces?

238
00:13:34,627 --> 00:13:36,748
Your people have been
fixing up Alexandria.

239
00:13:36,773 --> 00:13:38,407
It's not my fault
the walker got in.

240
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:41,835
You should've known
about Rachel and Hilltop.

241
00:13:41,996 --> 00:13:43,364
Because I'm a mind-reader?

242
00:13:44,143 --> 00:13:46,254
How do you think this little
detour looks to Pamela?

243
00:13:46,854 --> 00:13:48,334
It looks like
we're not prepared.

244
00:13:48,359 --> 00:13:49,966
It looks like
you're not prepared.

245
00:13:50,193 --> 00:13:51,960
Lance, you know Pamela, alright?

246
00:13:51,985 --> 00:13:52,989
I don't.

247
00:13:53,364 --> 00:13:54,710
You didn't anticipate this?

248
00:13:54,735 --> 00:13:56,068
It's not my problem.

249
00:13:56,093 --> 00:13:58,891
Stop acting like Alexandria means
more to you than it does to me.

250
00:13:59,751 --> 00:14:01,669
Right now, you and I
want the same thing.

251
00:14:01,957 --> 00:14:04,147
Which means you and I are
in the same sinking boat.

252
00:14:05,418 --> 00:14:07,561
Is Maggie gonna make
this difficult for us?

253
00:14:10,429 --> 00:14:11,999
Huh. Fabulous.

254
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:14,205
So you know?

255
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:15,550
This is all or
nothing for Pamela.

256
00:14:16,578 --> 00:14:18,971
So if Maggie says no
and Oceanside walks,

257
00:14:19,304 --> 00:14:21,107
Alexandria is cut off.

258
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,987
Then we'll figure it out.

259
00:14:26,678 --> 00:14:27,868
Sure.

260
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:30,508
'Cause it was going so
well before we stepped in.

261
00:15:21,857 --> 00:15:22,909
Daryl: You alright?

262
00:15:26,988 --> 00:15:28,276
At ease.

263
00:15:37,329 --> 00:15:38,771
You must be Maggie.

264
00:16:00,735 --> 00:16:02,084
I already ate.

265
00:16:03,085 --> 00:16:04,125
Thanks.

266
00:16:04,492 --> 00:16:06,000
I'll just leave it right here.

267
00:16:07,116 --> 00:16:08,258
There you go.

268
00:16:09,422 --> 00:16:10,767
It's good to see you guys.

269
00:16:12,298 --> 00:16:13,328
Maggie...

270
00:16:14,251 --> 00:16:15,727
Why do you trust these people?

271
00:16:16,319 --> 00:16:17,881
Daryl: Who says we do?

272
00:16:18,723 --> 00:16:20,047
When do I ever?

273
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:22,344
Fair enough.

274
00:16:22,951 --> 00:16:25,258
It's good to see Alexandria
getting cleaned up, though.

275
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,494
Least their word
meant something.

276
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:33,041
Yeah, there's like 50,000
people living there.

277
00:16:33,372 --> 00:16:36,690
At least 49.9 seem like
decent enough folks.

278
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:39,443
And it's not forever.

279
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:41,897
You sure you don't
want to come with us?

280
00:16:42,359 --> 00:16:44,030
You don't have to do this alone.

281
00:16:44,401 --> 00:16:46,011
Hey, sorry to interrupt.

282
00:16:46,409 --> 00:16:48,106
The forward unit
picked up a swarm.

283
00:16:48,131 --> 00:16:49,937
We have some extra
rifles with us.

284
00:16:49,962 --> 00:16:51,398
So while they're handling that,

285
00:16:51,423 --> 00:16:53,616
Governor Milton proposed
that we all go hunting,

286
00:16:53,989 --> 00:16:55,249
if you're up for that?

287
00:17:16,048 --> 00:17:18,788
We'll scare all the food away
stomping around like this.

288
00:17:19,114 --> 00:17:21,256
I'll go with Maggie,
and you boys pair off.

289
00:17:22,874 --> 00:17:24,455
Don't need a minder
this time, General.

290
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,491
We'll be fine.

291
00:17:35,339 --> 00:17:36,974
How did things get so bad?

292
00:17:38,678 --> 00:17:39,990
Maggie: How do they ever?

293
00:17:40,411 --> 00:17:42,170
I've met so many communities,

294
00:17:42,195 --> 00:17:44,443
and I still can't figure out
what makes some lucky and

295
00:17:45,735 --> 00:17:47,257
able to fight off the world

296
00:17:47,282 --> 00:17:48,567
while others can't.

297
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,326
I don't believe in luck.

298
00:17:50,676 --> 00:17:51,977
That's interesting.

299
00:17:53,192 --> 00:17:54,897
I'm sensing more of an opinion.

300
00:17:56,006 --> 00:17:57,969
I mean, luck is
about opportunity.

301
00:17:58,784 --> 00:18:01,539
I don't know anybody who's
had more opportunity than you.

302
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:05,449
Well, since we're
being honest...

303
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:07,345
Cards on the table, Maggie.

304
00:18:07,816 --> 00:18:09,453
I didn't want to
come on this tour.

305
00:18:12,309 --> 00:18:14,876
I have thousands of
people under my care

306
00:18:15,102 --> 00:18:17,484
and that responsibility
keeps me up at night.

307
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:20,170
That's the price of leadership.

308
00:18:21,435 --> 00:18:23,148
Everything costs something.

309
00:18:24,051 --> 00:18:25,602
For me, it's sleep.

310
00:18:26,655 --> 00:18:28,570
You know what I think
about at 3:00 A.M.?

311
00:18:29,114 --> 00:18:30,115
Hm?

312
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,232
Who can we trust?

313
00:18:31,257 --> 00:18:32,724
How do we stay safe?

314
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:35,860
Your communities are
small by our standards.

315
00:18:35,961 --> 00:18:37,919
I wasn't sure the risk
of going back and forth

316
00:18:37,944 --> 00:18:39,087
would be worth it.

317
00:18:39,112 --> 00:18:40,354
Then why are you here?

318
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:43,003
The right allies
make us stronger.

319
00:18:43,028 --> 00:18:45,831
This world belongs
to us, not the dead.

320
00:18:46,498 --> 00:18:48,825
Meeting all of you,
hearing all your stories,

321
00:18:49,278 --> 00:18:50,958
has confirmed what
I've always believed.

322
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:55,338
There is a natural order to
things that has vanished,

323
00:18:55,819 --> 00:18:58,106
and that order needs
to be restored.

324
00:18:58,745 --> 00:19:01,008
It provides a
future for our kids.

325
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:04,467
15 million little city-states
fighting each other

326
00:19:04,492 --> 00:19:05,847
for power and resources

327
00:19:05,872 --> 00:19:08,293
is never going to be able to
provide that kind of stability.

328
00:19:09,662 --> 00:19:11,533
I'm offering you the same thing

329
00:19:11,558 --> 00:19:14,526
your mutual protection
pact with Oceanside did.

330
00:19:15,294 --> 00:19:16,790
Someone who has your back.

331
00:19:40,877 --> 00:19:41,908
Ah!

332
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,143
Mm.

333
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:46,411
Yeah.

334
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:50,843
Hey. Hey.

335
00:19:50,886 --> 00:19:52,286
Hey. Hey.

336
00:19:52,753 --> 00:19:54,849
I just thought I'd see
how you were doing.

337
00:19:55,274 --> 00:19:58,146
Um, cooking, actually.

338
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:00,535
Uh

339
00:20:01,257 --> 00:20:02,575
You hungry?

340
00:20:02,647 --> 00:20:05,388
Nabila and Jerry
left me a buffet.

341
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:07,058
Okay. It's, um,

342
00:20:07,505 --> 00:20:09,221
crispy. Yeah. Why not?

343
00:20:09,685 --> 00:20:10,698
Here.

344
00:20:17,259 --> 00:20:20,183
Jerry said you had
a check-up today...

345
00:20:20,383 --> 00:20:22,215
Anything come up?

346
00:20:22,933 --> 00:20:24,390
It's a funny thing.

347
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:28,910
What? Tomi said I was
scheduled for surgery.

348
00:20:29,398 --> 00:20:30,747
They bumped me up in the line.

349
00:20:32,605 --> 00:20:33,683
That's good.

350
00:20:33,808 --> 00:20:36,158
That's great. That's great.

351
00:20:40,847 --> 00:20:42,326
Right? Wait.

352
00:20:44,771 --> 00:20:45,864
Did you...?

353
00:20:46,386 --> 00:20:47,655
What did you do?

354
00:20:48,066 --> 00:20:49,160
I didn't...

355
00:20:51,581 --> 00:20:53,394
My debt was wiped out.

356
00:20:55,733 --> 00:20:57,362
Hornsby owed me a favor.

357
00:21:00,729 --> 00:21:02,143
It's cheating!

358
00:21:03,384 --> 00:21:04,863
Why would you do that?

359
00:21:05,021 --> 00:21:06,936
Because I don't want you to die.

360
00:21:06,986 --> 00:21:08,118
Carol.

361
00:21:09,897 --> 00:21:12,005
Those lines are a lie.

362
00:21:12,809 --> 00:21:14,753
You think Pamela Milton
would think twice

363
00:21:14,796 --> 00:21:17,184
before doing the same
thing for her shitty son?

364
00:21:18,961 --> 00:21:21,094
Have you been inside
that hospital, Carol?

365
00:21:23,496 --> 00:21:25,778
'Cause if you had been,
you'd see all those people,

366
00:21:27,049 --> 00:21:28,059
suffering,

367
00:21:29,448 --> 00:21:30,465
same as me.

368
00:21:32,268 --> 00:21:33,660
Waiting for treatment.

369
00:21:35,032 --> 00:21:36,098
Same as me.

370
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:40,051
You're supposed to just die
because the system is broken?

371
00:21:41,904 --> 00:21:46,075
Lesser men have been given
more and done nothing with it.

372
00:21:47,953 --> 00:21:50,294
You are not a lesser man.

373
00:21:54,551 --> 00:21:56,394
I think that's
called an autocracy.

374
00:21:57,204 --> 00:21:58,465
No, it's not.

375
00:21:58,603 --> 00:22:00,332
Liberties haven't gone anywhere.

376
00:22:01,232 --> 00:22:02,723
You're the leader at Hilltop.

377
00:22:02,786 --> 00:22:04,325
You make the decisions.

378
00:22:04,838 --> 00:22:06,684
You consider
yourself an autocrat?

379
00:22:07,216 --> 00:22:12,231
I-I lead the way I was
taught by Deanna and Georgie.

380
00:22:12,578 --> 00:22:15,262
The communities that
we built are fair.

381
00:22:15,529 --> 00:22:17,009
The Commonwealth is fair.

382
00:22:17,273 --> 00:22:19,144
Yeah, but you drive a nicer car

383
00:22:19,169 --> 00:22:21,372
and live in a nicer house
than everybody else.

384
00:22:21,521 --> 00:22:24,133
I have more responsibilities
than the average worker.

385
00:22:24,236 --> 00:22:26,514
A leader has to give her
people something to look up to.

386
00:22:26,539 --> 00:22:28,933
Alright, well, I want people
to look up to what I've done

387
00:22:28,958 --> 00:22:31,265
and what I do, not what
I have that they don't.

388
00:22:34,683 --> 00:22:36,082
Behind you.

389
00:22:37,271 --> 00:22:40,223
You want it or shall I?

390
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:43,618
Well, I was thinking about
going after the one behind you.

391
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:23,634
Hey.

392
00:23:28,813 --> 00:23:30,510
Hey, come on, now.

393
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:37,475
You okay?

394
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,185
I'm great. How are you?

395
00:23:41,513 --> 00:23:43,290
You got a great poker face.

396
00:23:43,315 --> 00:23:44,359
Thank you.

397
00:23:46,709 --> 00:23:48,400
How's the new job going?

398
00:23:49,171 --> 00:23:50,221
Oh, you know.

399
00:23:51,352 --> 00:23:52,353
It's a lot.

400
00:23:53,852 --> 00:23:55,418
Do you regret coming here?

401
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:56,987
Do you?

402
00:24:00,342 --> 00:24:01,682
So you like it here?

403
00:24:02,424 --> 00:24:04,172
We all get to be together.

404
00:24:05,833 --> 00:24:07,227
Everyone's safe.

405
00:24:07,395 --> 00:24:08,893
So it works for now.

406
00:24:14,582 --> 00:24:16,086
Going with the flow.

407
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:19,135
Didn't think I'd end
up basically a cop,

408
00:24:21,146 --> 00:24:22,899
but I'm pretty good at it, so...

409
00:24:24,946 --> 00:24:27,322
Pretty damn good at
everything you do, Rosita.

410
00:24:29,977 --> 00:24:31,455
Thanks, Eugene.

411
00:24:33,316 --> 00:24:34,969
I do miss home, though.

412
00:24:35,772 --> 00:24:36,981
Yeah.

413
00:24:37,531 --> 00:24:39,271
I miss going outside the walls.

414
00:24:39,296 --> 00:24:41,578
I miss the freedom
that we used to have.

415
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,922
But it'll come.

416
00:24:47,218 --> 00:24:49,836
When Alexandria's
fixed back up, then

417
00:24:50,118 --> 00:24:52,751
then people have choices
and that's good, you know?

418
00:24:59,898 --> 00:25:01,766
You're excited about the future.

419
00:25:03,401 --> 00:25:05,207
Yeah, I guess I am.

420
00:25:09,423 --> 00:25:11,660
Eugene, what is it? Spill.

421
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:19,199
I was thinking about
when we first met

422
00:25:19,548 --> 00:25:21,202
and how I was lying to you.

423
00:25:23,316 --> 00:25:24,584
About who I was.

424
00:25:24,609 --> 00:25:26,473
About Washington, D.C. And...

425
00:25:27,993 --> 00:25:29,907
That was a long
time ago, Eugene.

426
00:25:33,093 --> 00:25:34,573
And we found our home.

427
00:25:34,598 --> 00:25:36,600
So going with the
flow works, right?

428
00:25:41,188 --> 00:25:42,673
Eugene, what is it? Get it out.

429
00:25:42,698 --> 00:25:43,830
You'll feel better.

430
00:25:49,953 --> 00:25:51,219
Stephanie...

431
00:25:54,809 --> 00:25:55,984
Isn't missing.

432
00:26:00,494 --> 00:26:01,863
I saw her.

433
00:26:02,425 --> 00:26:03,600
She just...

434
00:26:10,939 --> 00:26:12,027
Broke up with me.

435
00:26:12,111 --> 00:26:13,333
She broke up with me.

436
00:26:14,327 --> 00:26:15,806
Eugene, I'm so sorry.

437
00:26:36,277 --> 00:26:38,166
She wasn't who I
thought she was.

438
00:26:38,783 --> 00:26:40,598
Screw her.

439
00:26:41,293 --> 00:26:42,990
You can do so much better.

440
00:26:44,581 --> 00:26:46,278
And you're gonna
find your person.

441
00:26:47,435 --> 00:26:49,437
She's out there. I promise.

442
00:27:07,929 --> 00:27:08,972
Dianne: Hey.

443
00:27:09,338 --> 00:27:10,846
They meant everything they said.

444
00:27:11,648 --> 00:27:13,302
All the Troopers that
came back with us,

445
00:27:13,327 --> 00:27:15,770
they're working on re-enforcing
the water tower right now.

446
00:27:16,479 --> 00:27:17,785
You went hunting with them?

447
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:19,551
Yeah. It's not much, but it's...

448
00:27:19,576 --> 00:27:21,355
More than we've had in weeks.

449
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:23,362
Yeah, we'll get dinner started.

450
00:27:23,387 --> 00:27:25,270
Alright. Thanks.

451
00:27:25,411 --> 00:27:26,552
Is everyone okay?

452
00:27:26,829 --> 00:27:27,920
Yeah, yeah.

453
00:27:27,945 --> 00:27:29,442
Everyone seems relieved.

454
00:27:29,638 --> 00:27:31,964
Hoping this means we can
actually get some sleep tonight.

455
00:27:33,412 --> 00:27:34,457
Daryl.

456
00:27:34,814 --> 00:27:35,945
Hi. Hey.

457
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:37,853
Was wondering when
you'd come back.

458
00:27:37,998 --> 00:27:39,609
Hey. How you holding up?

459
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:41,183
Uh, it's okay.

460
00:27:41,979 --> 00:27:44,590
We're doing our best. Yeah?

461
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:48,480
Just feel like maybe some things
just can't be fixed, you know?

462
00:27:49,806 --> 00:27:52,026
Just feels kind of
pointless sometimes.

463
00:27:52,539 --> 00:27:54,589
I hear you. How
do you know when?

464
00:27:55,189 --> 00:27:56,362
When what?

465
00:27:57,245 --> 00:27:59,449
Just when it's
time to walk away?

466
00:28:00,468 --> 00:28:02,209
Is that what you wanna do?

467
00:28:02,431 --> 00:28:06,712
Hey, Maggie, is it okay if
we hand out some supplies?

468
00:28:06,794 --> 00:28:08,274
We have more than enough.

469
00:28:08,482 --> 00:28:09,908
Food, fuel.

470
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:14,329
Sure. Thank you.

471
00:28:14,428 --> 00:28:15,646
Great. We're on it.

472
00:28:15,742 --> 00:28:17,529
Uh, you two. Come with me.

473
00:28:20,719 --> 00:28:22,270
Hey, Daryl, look what I got.

474
00:28:22,428 --> 00:28:23,739
Oh, my God.

475
00:28:24,507 --> 00:28:25,943
Hey, we're gonna
pass out some food.

476
00:28:25,968 --> 00:28:27,428
You wanna help us? Yeah.

477
00:28:28,199 --> 00:28:29,849
You take the big one.

478
00:28:30,934 --> 00:28:32,631
Hey, give this to Elijah.

479
00:28:32,656 --> 00:28:33,724
Okay.

480
00:28:35,206 --> 00:28:37,121
Mercer: Must be hard
to be a kid out here.

481
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:39,115
He grew up on the road.

482
00:28:39,421 --> 00:28:41,336
He's a different kind of kid.

483
00:28:43,248 --> 00:28:45,586
Your friend. She like
torturing herself out here?

484
00:28:48,961 --> 00:28:50,734
This place used to
be really special.

485
00:28:51,112 --> 00:28:52,132
Different.

486
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:53,970
It's going through
hard times now, but

487
00:28:53,994 --> 00:28:55,696
it'll be back up and running.

488
00:28:55,721 --> 00:28:56,961
Just watch.

489
00:28:57,632 --> 00:29:00,842
I guess not all places are
as lucky as Alexandria.

490
00:29:01,625 --> 00:29:03,888
Not all places are as
lucky as Commonwealth.

491
00:29:07,737 --> 00:29:09,173
Are you coming around?

492
00:29:10,863 --> 00:29:12,399
I wouldn't go that far,

493
00:29:13,149 --> 00:29:15,674
but you guys, uh, have
done good stuff for us,

494
00:29:15,699 --> 00:29:18,149
so, I don't know,
I'll give you that.

495
00:29:19,365 --> 00:29:21,198
Commonwealth ain't perfect, bro.

496
00:29:22,292 --> 00:29:23,564
What, you think?

497
00:29:24,504 --> 00:29:26,229
Just don't get too comfortable.

498
00:29:27,831 --> 00:29:29,398
The only reason you're
out of your armor

499
00:29:29,423 --> 00:29:31,698
is because someone thought
it'd be good for appearances.

500
00:29:32,493 --> 00:29:35,671
You got your role to
play, and I got mine.

501
00:29:46,164 --> 00:29:47,687
We'll be in here
when you wake up.

502
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:51,590
Pizza, ice cream. The works.

503
00:29:53,435 --> 00:29:54,480
No.

504
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:57,769
No pineapple.

505
00:29:58,576 --> 00:30:00,292
I'm serious, Jerry.

506
00:30:01,019 --> 00:30:03,379
Pineapple on pizza
makes no sense.

507
00:30:03,411 --> 00:30:04,496
Pizza?

508
00:30:04,697 --> 00:30:07,371
You're not eating anything but
Jell-O for a while, hotshot.

509
00:30:26,373 --> 00:30:27,566
Nervous twitch?

510
00:30:29,256 --> 00:30:30,527
Lucky coin.

511
00:30:31,273 --> 00:30:33,275
I had a lucky
rabbit's foot once.

512
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:37,806
My dog brought it home with the
rabbit still attached to it.

513
00:30:38,666 --> 00:30:40,193
My old man gave this to me.

514
00:30:40,881 --> 00:30:43,467
When I was a kid, I thought
it was made of gold.

515
00:30:44,741 --> 00:30:47,970
Turns out, it's
just gold-plated.

516
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,962
Inside's same as a lowly nickel.

517
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:55,239
Have you decided yet?

518
00:31:00,507 --> 00:31:02,378
What do you get out of all this?

519
00:31:05,412 --> 00:31:06,769
Come on, Maggie.

520
00:31:08,535 --> 00:31:11,058
Let's not pretend the obvious
isn't staring us in the face.

521
00:31:11,915 --> 00:31:13,456
You're in over your head.

522
00:31:15,325 --> 00:31:17,104
You don't know me very well.

523
00:31:17,464 --> 00:31:19,497
I know you're smart enough
to know a good offer

524
00:31:19,522 --> 00:31:20,741
when you hear it.

525
00:31:23,829 --> 00:31:26,309
And I'm smart enough to know
I've just pissed you off.

526
00:31:29,381 --> 00:31:31,467
You haven't answered
my question.

527
00:31:34,297 --> 00:31:35,888
Alright. I'll bite.

528
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:39,029
The first time I
went to Alexandria,

529
00:31:39,072 --> 00:31:40,119
I could see it.

530
00:31:40,776 --> 00:31:42,032
The potential.

531
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:44,790
Maggie, do you really
believe that Hilltop,

532
00:31:44,931 --> 00:31:46,361
as it currently stands,

533
00:31:46,386 --> 00:31:48,486
is the best you'll ever have?

534
00:31:48,806 --> 00:31:50,032
Or Alexandria?

535
00:31:50,638 --> 00:31:52,074
Or even Oceanside?

536
00:31:53,723 --> 00:31:54,723
Look around.

537
00:31:56,341 --> 00:31:59,096
We can have so much more.

538
00:32:00,308 --> 00:32:01,487
Imagine

539
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,219
being able to pick Hershel up

540
00:32:04,244 --> 00:32:06,072
from a concert at
the Commonwealth,

541
00:32:06,831 --> 00:32:09,478
take him to a doctor's
appointment in Alexandria,

542
00:32:10,621 --> 00:32:13,369
then jump on a
boat at Oceanside,

543
00:32:13,664 --> 00:32:15,666
traveling up the coast.

544
00:32:18,417 --> 00:32:19,969
And what's up that coast?

545
00:32:20,898 --> 00:32:22,421
Another port town?

546
00:32:22,667 --> 00:32:24,001
Another school?

547
00:32:25,105 --> 00:32:26,594
How about a university?

548
00:32:29,125 --> 00:32:31,534
Have you ever imagined being
able to drop your son off

549
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:33,324
for his freshman
year of college?

550
00:32:35,085 --> 00:32:36,522
Tried to build it.

551
00:32:37,995 --> 00:32:39,301
Of course you did.

552
00:32:40,503 --> 00:32:42,581
Because you and I see
things the same way.

553
00:32:44,063 --> 00:32:46,245
Imagine the world
you want to build.

554
00:32:49,184 --> 00:32:50,376
Hold it in your mind.

555
00:32:52,189 --> 00:32:56,491
Now picture the power of
50,000 Commonwealth workers

556
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:59,068
helping you make that
vision a reality.

557
00:32:59,524 --> 00:33:01,439
Think what you could
accomplish then.

558
00:33:05,215 --> 00:33:06,737
Man: Swarm incoming!

559
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:26,257
This way.

560
00:34:18,729 --> 00:34:19,912
Fire!

561
00:34:38,564 --> 00:34:41,089
Imagine not having
to deal with this

562
00:34:41,255 --> 00:34:43,479
every time that alarm goes off.

563
00:34:43,615 --> 00:34:46,057
Yeah, we could keep building.

564
00:34:46,816 --> 00:34:48,924
No more starts and stops.

565
00:34:49,612 --> 00:34:50,961
I know there's a
lot to consider,

566
00:34:50,986 --> 00:34:52,081
but, I mean

567
00:34:53,807 --> 00:34:55,323
look around.

568
00:34:55,896 --> 00:34:57,166
We need this.

569
00:34:58,286 --> 00:34:59,378
I know.

570
00:35:02,264 --> 00:35:04,612
Mercer: Formation!

571
00:35:05,666 --> 00:35:06,759
Let's go!

572
00:35:22,864 --> 00:35:24,431
Dixon. Fall in.

573
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:25,459
Daryl: Hold up.

574
00:35:30,062 --> 00:35:31,152
Hey.

575
00:35:33,377 --> 00:35:35,300
Remember, they're
always watching.

576
00:35:35,682 --> 00:35:36,768
Got me?

577
00:35:36,805 --> 00:35:38,502
Daryl: Yeah. Yeah, I got it.

578
00:35:38,527 --> 00:35:39,636
Mercer: Left face.

579
00:35:39,661 --> 00:35:41,401
Forward march.

580
00:36:02,548 --> 00:36:04,167
Never a dull moment
here, is there?

581
00:36:04,192 --> 00:36:06,376
Mm, we try.

582
00:36:06,429 --> 00:36:07,540
Everyone okay?

583
00:36:07,741 --> 00:36:10,175
Yeah, no injuries,
all limbs intact.

584
00:36:10,588 --> 00:36:11,956
I'd call that a good day.

585
00:36:15,092 --> 00:36:17,181
But the Hilltop's gonna
pass on your offer.

586
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,128
Can I ask why?

587
00:36:22,216 --> 00:36:25,999
'Cause, like you said,
everything costs something.

588
00:36:47,655 --> 00:36:49,657
No, please don't shut the door.

589
00:36:55,476 --> 00:36:58,422
Found some raspberry goodness
of the Inside Scoop variety.

590
00:36:59,797 --> 00:37:02,060
It's not exactly black
raspberry, but...

591
00:37:05,304 --> 00:37:06,918
Please, it's very cold.

592
00:37:26,588 --> 00:37:27,606
Um,

593
00:37:28,842 --> 00:37:30,393
I'm so sorry, Max.

594
00:37:30,771 --> 00:37:32,989
For my ungentle
man-like behavior.For

595
00:37:33,113 --> 00:37:35,113
running away. For not listening.

596
00:37:36,277 --> 00:37:39,017
I was bruised and confused.

597
00:37:39,042 --> 00:37:40,307
You were pretty damn rude.

598
00:37:40,332 --> 00:37:41,392
I was.

599
00:37:42,416 --> 00:37:43,417
Indeed.

600
00:37:44,893 --> 00:37:47,073
I let Hornsby get
inside my head,and...

601
00:37:47,541 --> 00:37:50,189
 it was an infiltration
of the most epic proportions.

602
00:37:50,214 --> 00:37:51,500
He is a snake.

603
00:37:51,828 --> 00:37:53,086
More like a worm.

604
00:37:53,794 --> 00:37:56,039
I let an imposter into my heart

605
00:37:56,797 --> 00:37:57,972
and my home.

606
00:37:58,134 --> 00:37:59,773
I let her read my manuscript.

607
00:37:59,892 --> 00:38:01,022
Manuscript?

608
00:38:01,523 --> 00:38:02,568
I...

609
00:38:03,278 --> 00:38:04,615
I'm writing a novel.

610
00:38:06,251 --> 00:38:08,945
Was a sepulcher involved?

611
00:38:11,328 --> 00:38:12,460
Obviously.

612
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:16,628
Did it take place in the
Carpathian Mountains?

613
00:38:16,653 --> 00:38:18,036
Carpathian Mountains, yes.

614
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:19,162
You let her read it?

615
00:38:19,187 --> 00:38:20,248
I thought she was you.

616
00:38:20,273 --> 00:38:22,639
I know, but, Eugene

617
00:38:22,875 --> 00:38:23,983
how?

618
00:38:24,561 --> 00:38:26,471
After all that time
we spent together,

619
00:38:26,496 --> 00:38:28,194
everything we told each other,

620
00:38:28,219 --> 00:38:30,758
how could you not
know it wasn't me?

621
00:38:31,979 --> 00:38:33,398
I do... I don't know.

622
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:36,137
I guess...

623
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:39,424
I figured out a long time ago

624
00:38:39,449 --> 00:38:40,735
that I'm not like most folks.

625
00:38:41,522 --> 00:38:43,654
I got used to rejection PDQ.

626
00:38:43,679 --> 00:38:47,218
Didn't even realize it was
rejection some of the times, but...

627
00:38:48,602 --> 00:38:51,200
well, suffice it to say,
it happened a fair amount.

628
00:38:53,044 --> 00:38:54,875
So there was a part of
me that always wondered

629
00:38:54,899 --> 00:38:56,422
if our connection
was all in my head.

630
00:38:58,583 --> 00:39:00,541
But when I got here,
and she didn't...

631
00:39:03,827 --> 00:39:04,915
Push me away...

632
00:39:07,532 --> 00:39:09,859
I just so badly wanted
this to be real.

633
00:39:11,318 --> 00:39:13,523
And subtle cues
escape me sometimes.

634
00:39:15,969 --> 00:39:19,312
Anyway, I never meant
to hurt you, Max.

635
00:39:20,658 --> 00:39:23,531
But my intent does
not excuse my impact.

636
00:39:25,227 --> 00:39:26,673
How can I make this up to you?

637
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:28,395
Will you allow me to try?

638
00:39:34,329 --> 00:39:35,596
I don't know.

639
00:39:50,604 --> 00:39:51,932
Can I read your novel?

640
00:39:56,505 --> 00:39:58,542
Well, as ill fortune
would have it,

641
00:39:58,654 --> 00:40:02,448
you came upon me whilst I was
burning the only physical copy.

642
00:40:02,473 --> 00:40:05,003
However, I have committed
much of the text to memory.

643
00:40:05,711 --> 00:40:07,080
What was the concept?

644
00:40:08,568 --> 00:40:11,646
A gumshoe by the
name of Steph Portman

645
00:40:11,671 --> 00:40:13,862
is caught up in a rollicking
international caper,

646
00:40:13,887 --> 00:40:15,588
trying to avert nuclear disaster

647
00:40:15,632 --> 00:40:17,329
and navigate the intricacies

648
00:40:17,372 --> 00:40:19,277
of the legal bureaucracies
back at home.

649
00:40:19,337 --> 00:40:21,175
You didn't make the
District Attorney corrupt,

650
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,706
did you? Certainly not.

651
00:40:23,386 --> 00:40:25,065
That would've surprised
exactly no one.

652
00:40:27,268 --> 00:40:29,917
I did, however, give him
an unsavory twin brother.

653
00:40:30,065 --> 00:40:33,042
Mm. Evil twin. Nice.

654
00:40:33,251 --> 00:40:34,745
Yeah, I thought so.

655
00:40:35,076 --> 00:40:39,416
You should, um, make
the twin a scientist.

656
00:40:40,333 --> 00:40:42,776
Ramp up the stakes on
the nuclear threat.

657
00:40:44,284 --> 00:40:46,286
That is exactly what I did.

658
00:40:51,762 --> 00:40:52,762
Hm.

659
00:40:54,123 --> 00:40:55,124
What?

660
00:40:58,102 --> 00:41:00,365
Just... felt like old times.

661
00:41:05,587 --> 00:41:07,596
Here. I got something for ya.

662
00:41:09,208 --> 00:41:10,292
It's from Judith.

663
00:41:10,713 --> 00:41:13,393
She said in case you're making
Hershel eat more horse meat.

664
00:41:13,418 --> 00:41:14,854
Oh, God.

665
00:41:16,451 --> 00:41:17,747
It was good to see you.

666
00:41:17,772 --> 00:41:18,841
Yeah.

667
00:41:20,062 --> 00:41:21,107
Be careful.

668
00:41:21,816 --> 00:41:23,551
If you need me, you
know where to find me.

669
00:41:23,923 --> 00:41:25,083
Same for you.

670
00:41:28,681 --> 00:41:29,860
Dianne?

671
00:41:30,811 --> 00:41:32,335
I'm leaving, Maggie.

672
00:41:32,723 --> 00:41:34,720
Some of the others
are coming with me,

673
00:41:34,964 --> 00:41:36,401
and you should, too.

674
00:41:38,613 --> 00:41:41,093
You need to be
careful who you trust.

675
00:41:41,646 --> 00:41:43,766
You know that
better than anybody.

676
00:41:44,413 --> 00:41:47,110
You also have to know
when to ask for help.

677
00:41:47,867 --> 00:41:49,464
It's harder than
it has ever been,

678
00:41:49,508 --> 00:41:50,844
and it doesn't have to be.

679
00:41:51,311 --> 00:41:53,210
I respect the hell outta you,

680
00:41:55,848 --> 00:41:57,709
but I can't do this anymore.

681
00:42:01,027 --> 00:42:02,256
I'm sorry.

682
00:42:23,294 --> 00:42:24,905
It was a worthy effort, Lance.

683
00:42:24,930 --> 00:42:25,952
It's not over.

684
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:27,219
It doesn't have to be.

685
00:42:27,412 --> 00:42:28,835
It's time to go home.

686
00:42:29,085 --> 00:42:30,565
We still have Alexandria.

687
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:32,764
I just need time to
get the other two.

688
00:42:33,397 --> 00:42:34,921
It was a bold move,
trying to bring

689
00:42:34,945 --> 00:42:37,053
three new communities
into the fold.

690
00:42:37,662 --> 00:42:40,428
I get why something like that
would be appealing to you.

691
00:42:41,363 --> 00:42:43,539
Someone needs to
run them, right?

692
00:42:45,463 --> 00:42:48,030
That selection would
be at your discretion,

693
00:42:49,615 --> 00:42:50,733
obviously.

694
00:42:51,725 --> 00:42:53,030
Obviously.

695
00:42:54,569 --> 00:42:56,639
I'm gonna pretend that
you were doing this

696
00:42:56,664 --> 00:42:59,397
for the good of the Commonwealth
rather than for yourself.

697
00:43:01,159 --> 00:43:02,724
I was doing this for you.

698
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:08,811
You've been ambitious
our whole lives, Lance.

699
00:43:10,142 --> 00:43:12,797
Ambition is notoriously
hard to reel in.

700
00:43:12,822 --> 00:43:14,128
So.

701
00:43:15,795 --> 00:43:18,572
If you want to try and
make it work, fine.

702
00:43:19,408 --> 00:43:21,636
But if your job at
home starts to suffer,

703
00:43:22,382 --> 00:43:24,285
there will be consequences.

704
00:43:26,022 --> 00:43:27,979
The Commonwealth
always comes first.

705
00:44:06,372 --> 00:44:07,392
Lance.

706
00:44:09,337 --> 00:44:10,681
Lance, you okay?

707
00:44:11,211 --> 00:44:12,386
"A" plus.

708
00:44:18,048 --> 00:44:19,869
What'd she say about Alexandria?

709
00:44:20,226 --> 00:44:21,228
We good?

710
00:44:25,618 --> 00:44:27,093
Everything's fine.

711
00:44:27,437 --> 00:44:28,720
Pamela's on board.

712
00:44:29,203 --> 00:44:31,578
In fact, we're gonna
bring even more people in.

713
00:44:31,793 --> 00:44:32,960
Get ready, Aaron.

714
00:44:34,086 --> 00:44:36,175
We are going to
remake the world.

715
00:44:45,912 --> 00:44:48,221
There's a group on
the Western border.

716
00:44:48,246 --> 00:44:50,272
We want to make first
contact and offer them help.

717
00:44:50,615 --> 00:44:52,399
Gabriel: What do you
know about these people?

718
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,088
Someone we know
must have sent him.

719
00:45:02,694 --> 00:45:05,913
Lance: I ask for a hundred troops,
there's no way Milton doesn't notice.

720
00:45:06,337 --> 00:45:09,471
I need a surgical solution.

721
00:45:20,850 --> 00:45:22,154
And you...

722
00:45:24,226 --> 00:45:25,451
You're Stephanie?

723
00:45:26,646 --> 00:45:27,739
No.

724
00:45:28,553 --> 00:45:29,841
I'm Max.

725
00:45:30,778 --> 00:45:32,258
There is no Stephanie.

726
00:45:32,283 --> 00:45:35,302
So, something interesting
about this episode,

727
00:45:35,327 --> 00:45:36,841
as you may or may
not have noticed,

728
00:45:36,866 --> 00:45:41,522
is that we start the whole
thing with this montage

729
00:45:41,566 --> 00:45:44,917
telling the story from
Max's point of view.

730
00:45:44,961 --> 00:45:47,311
And we realize that
underneath everything,

731
00:45:47,354 --> 00:45:50,444
there was this kind of other
story that was burning.

732
00:45:52,951 --> 00:45:54,230
It's not what you think.

733
00:45:54,255 --> 00:45:55,349
Oh, yeah?

734
00:45:55,974 --> 00:45:59,889
One of the things, creatively,
that we did, and it's subtle,

735
00:45:59,932 --> 00:46:02,152
is that we're not
reusing footage,

736
00:46:02,195 --> 00:46:05,982
and so we wanted to let Max have
her version of the story, too,

737
00:46:06,025 --> 00:46:09,357
so this is her experience of
what that moment was like.

738
00:46:09,382 --> 00:46:10,428
Excuse me.

739
00:46:12,329 --> 00:46:14,506
That wouldn't happen to be
Rocky Road there, would it?

740
00:46:15,091 --> 00:46:18,979
We actually linger, like, in
a different expression on her

741
00:46:19,038 --> 00:46:21,954
when she and Eugene meet eyes,
before she has to go away,

742
00:46:21,998 --> 00:46:25,566
because we just felt like,
this is a subjective montage

743
00:46:25,610 --> 00:46:28,569
and so she's having a
slightly different experience

744
00:46:28,613 --> 00:46:30,615
of the same scene, and
so we wanted to show it

745
00:46:30,658 --> 00:46:32,878
from her perspective as
she's telling the story.

746
00:46:32,922 --> 00:46:34,921
I was told this is
pre-op blood work?

747
00:46:34,946 --> 00:46:36,715
Make sure he's stable
enough for the surgery.

748
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:37,815
Surgery?

749
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:39,406
To take out this tumor.

750
00:46:39,450 --> 00:46:41,185
Did no one tell you?

751
00:46:41,845 --> 00:46:42,946
Whoa.

752
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:46,631
For Ezekiel, he
really wants to live,

753
00:46:46,674 --> 00:46:49,373
and he feels like
he has more to give,

754
00:46:49,416 --> 00:46:52,158
that he wants to be with
his friends and loved ones,

755
00:46:52,202 --> 00:46:54,508
but he's also
resigned to the fact

756
00:46:54,552 --> 00:46:57,772
that maybe he's not
going to make it.

757
00:46:57,816 --> 00:47:00,340
And I think Ezekiel
had gotten to a place

758
00:47:00,384 --> 00:47:03,343
where he's a little bit
at peace with the idea

759
00:47:03,387 --> 00:47:05,215
that he might not
have much time left,

760
00:47:05,258 --> 00:47:07,391
and so he is shocked
by the fact that

761
00:47:07,434 --> 00:47:09,306
he's offered this surgery.

762
00:47:09,349 --> 00:47:10,664
Did you...

763
00:47:11,032 --> 00:47:12,541
What did you do?

764
00:47:12,739 --> 00:47:13,812
I didn't...

765
00:47:16,324 --> 00:47:17,969
My debt was wiped out.

766
00:47:18,655 --> 00:47:20,344
Hornsby owed me a favor.

767
00:47:21,172 --> 00:47:23,407
He's a very moral person,

768
00:47:23,457 --> 00:47:28,313
and the idea of cheating
for anything is just, like,

769
00:47:28,338 --> 00:47:29,587
horrific to him.

770
00:47:29,630 --> 00:47:31,241
He has such empathy,

771
00:47:31,284 --> 00:47:32,982
even for these people
that he don't know.

772
00:47:33,025 --> 00:47:35,593
I think it really
speaks to who Ezekiel is

773
00:47:35,636 --> 00:47:37,160
and was as a leader.

774
00:47:37,203 --> 00:47:39,640
Lesser men have been given more

775
00:47:39,665 --> 00:47:41,555
and done nothing with it.

776
00:47:42,977 --> 00:47:45,283
You are not a lesser man.

777
00:47:45,308 --> 00:47:48,344
And I think Carol's
point of view is like,

778
00:47:48,388 --> 00:47:50,129
everybody's cheating the system,

779
00:47:50,173 --> 00:47:52,479
but it's like, if
you get this surgery,

780
00:47:52,538 --> 00:47:54,453
maybe you can do
something about it.

781
00:47:54,478 --> 00:47:56,265
Even if she doesn't say
it in so many words,

782
00:47:56,293 --> 00:47:58,050
that's what she
truly, truly believes.

783
00:47:58,094 --> 00:48:00,052
She knows that, and she's right.

784
00:48:05,296 --> 00:48:06,391
You alright?

785
00:48:08,408 --> 00:48:09,888
It was really important for us

786
00:48:09,932 --> 00:48:12,325
that when Pamela
first meets Maggie,

787
00:48:12,369 --> 00:48:15,502
that she doesn't meet Maggie
kind of completely down and out,

788
00:48:15,546 --> 00:48:17,765
which is kind of where she's at.

789
00:48:17,809 --> 00:48:19,202
You must be Maggie.

790
00:48:19,245 --> 00:48:22,422
For Pamela, she's
impressed by Maggie.

791
00:48:22,466 --> 00:48:25,208
She's impressed by the
fact that other communities

792
00:48:25,251 --> 00:48:26,992
consider her a leader.

793
00:48:27,036 --> 00:48:30,039
She's impressed by what
she saw at Alexandria,

794
00:48:30,082 --> 00:48:33,433
knowing that a leader of
another community, Maggie,

795
00:48:33,477 --> 00:48:37,089
helped with the plans for
what Alexandria became,

796
00:48:37,133 --> 00:48:39,874
and what she sees
in Maggie is, like,

797
00:48:39,918 --> 00:48:43,487
here's somebody who has
street smarts and is tough

798
00:48:43,530 --> 00:48:45,663
and knows her way
around a weapon,

799
00:48:45,706 --> 00:48:48,448
and she has a kind
of respect for that.

800
00:48:54,977 --> 00:48:57,631
For Maggie, she's just
in it with her people,

801
00:48:57,675 --> 00:49:00,765
and I think that's also one
of the contrasts that you see

802
00:49:00,808 --> 00:49:02,027
right off the bat.

803
00:49:02,071 --> 00:49:04,943
Maggie is dressed
really kind of the same

804
00:49:04,987 --> 00:49:08,468
as the people that are part
of her little community,

805
00:49:08,512 --> 00:49:10,731
and she's doing the same stuff,

806
00:49:10,775 --> 00:49:14,083
whereas Pamela's kind
of in a special vehicle

807
00:49:14,126 --> 00:49:18,087
with special protection that
is different than the others.

808
00:49:18,130 --> 00:49:19,784
She's wearing a special outfit.

809
00:49:19,827 --> 00:49:22,265
And all of those are
meant to be hints

810
00:49:22,308 --> 00:49:25,572
at the things that bother
Maggie about the system,

811
00:49:25,616 --> 00:49:27,256
because she just
doesn't agree with it.

812
00:49:30,534 --> 00:49:31,755
Fire!

813
00:49:34,627 --> 00:49:38,370
She's looking at this military
and just realizing, like,

814
00:49:38,395 --> 00:49:43,348
"Wow, they just mowed down
a whole lot of Walkers,"

815
00:49:43,373 --> 00:49:47,986
and that bothers her,
because she knows that

816
00:49:48,030 --> 00:49:51,337
if they ever came to a
point of disagreement,

817
00:49:51,381 --> 00:49:55,602
what's to stop them from
just mowing them down, too?

818
00:49:55,646 --> 00:49:58,344
And so I think, for Maggie,
it's a matter of principle.

819
00:49:58,388 --> 00:50:00,365
The Hilltop's gonna
pass on your offer.

820
00:50:01,278 --> 00:50:02,825
Could I ask why?

821
00:50:03,589 --> 00:50:05,417
'Cause like you said,

822
00:50:05,743 --> 00:50:07,527
everything costs something.

823
00:50:07,571 --> 00:50:10,400
That's one of tougher
decisions that she makes,

824
00:50:10,443 --> 00:50:14,186
because her community is
really in dire straits,

825
00:50:14,230 --> 00:50:17,581
and by virtue of the fact that
she makes a different decision

826
00:50:17,624 --> 00:50:20,932
than Alexandria made, she
loses some of her people.

827
00:50:20,975 --> 00:50:22,325
I'm leaving, Maggie.

828
00:50:22,368 --> 00:50:25,023
Some of the others
are coming with me,

829
00:50:25,067 --> 00:50:26,285
and you should, too.

830
00:50:26,329 --> 00:50:28,113
There's a cost to
Maggie's decision.

831
00:50:28,157 --> 00:50:29,810
For us, when we're
writing the show,

832
00:50:29,854 --> 00:50:33,510
we're always trying to look at,
when somebody chooses something,

833
00:50:33,553 --> 00:50:35,947
what are they saying "yes" to?

834
00:50:35,990 --> 00:50:37,992
'Cause it's very rare in life

835
00:50:38,036 --> 00:50:40,995
that you say "yes" to
something or choose something

836
00:50:41,039 --> 00:50:43,389
and that there isn't
a potential downside.

837
00:50:43,433 --> 00:50:46,349
You know, it's going to be even
harder for her and her child,

838
00:50:46,392 --> 00:50:49,830
and she knows that's
not an easy decision,

839
00:50:49,874 --> 00:50:52,224
but she feels like it's
the right decision for her.

840
00:50:52,268 --> 00:50:53,629
Get ready, Aaron.

841
00:50:54,605 --> 00:50:56,868
We're going to remake the world.

841
00:50:57,305 --> 00:51:57,883
