1
00:00:01,269 --> 00:00:03,532
I said break it up. There's
enough food for everyone.

2
00:00:03,557 --> 00:00:05,478
- One week.
- We just took in

3
00:00:05,503 --> 00:00:06,678
two new communities.

4
00:00:06,703 --> 00:00:08,523
We have no crops, no back stock.

5
00:00:08,548 --> 00:00:10,507
I know one more
place... Meridian.

6
00:00:10,843 --> 00:00:12,382
The place I lived before this.

7
00:00:19,124 --> 00:00:20,908
Run!

8
00:00:22,257 --> 00:00:23,693
Aah!

9
00:00:27,001 --> 00:00:28,568
Go! Go!

10
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,440
 Run!

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,074
-== [ www.OpenSubtitles.com ] ==-

12
00:00:43,312 --> 00:00:44,955
Dog!

13
00:02:12,411 --> 00:02:14,010
Gah!

14
00:02:20,462 --> 00:02:21,942
No! No!

15
00:04:33,232 --> 00:04:34,639
Let him go.

16
00:04:38,048 --> 00:04:39,554
I said let him go.

17
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,887
I never thought
I'd see you again.

18
00:05:06,384 --> 00:05:07,980
Yeah, I thought the same.

19
00:05:11,498 --> 00:05:13,135
What're you doing out here?

20
00:05:16,423 --> 00:05:17,573
You alone?

21
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:20,402
You see anybody with me?

22
00:05:21,086 --> 00:05:23,610
I saw you out on the
road with the others.

23
00:05:26,456 --> 00:05:27,573
Who are they?

24
00:05:36,188 --> 00:05:37,351
You one of them?

25
00:05:37,442 --> 00:05:39,673
Crossed a small
group on the road.

26
00:05:40,445 --> 00:05:43,047
No. I ain't one of them.

27
00:05:43,647 --> 00:05:45,922
I travel light, like always.

28
00:05:48,061 --> 00:05:50,237
We're gonna go. Come on, boy.

29
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,565
Come on.

30
00:05:52,282 --> 00:05:54,931
Well, that's funny.
What's funny?

31
00:05:54,956 --> 00:05:56,417
I always thought he
liked you better.

32
00:05:56,461 --> 00:05:57,636
Look, I don't know
who you're fighting,

33
00:05:57,679 --> 00:05:59,674
but I am not part of it.

34
00:06:00,396 --> 00:06:01,854
We're going. Come on!

35
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:15,328

36
00:08:07,853 --> 00:08:10,159
Let's see if you're right.

37
00:08:51,244 --> 00:08:53,202
I came back for you.

38
00:08:56,902 --> 00:08:59,426
I looked everywhere for you.

39
00:09:06,433 --> 00:09:08,653
I'm sorry you ended
up with these people.

40
00:09:08,696 --> 00:09:10,639
These people are my family.

41
00:09:13,483 --> 00:09:15,451
They never stopped
looking for me.

42
00:09:16,428 --> 00:09:18,091
When they found me, I came home.

43
00:09:25,347 --> 00:09:27,561
How about your family, Daryl?

44
00:09:28,716 --> 00:09:30,633
The ones you told me about?

45
00:09:31,482 --> 00:09:33,020
That who was out on the road?

46
00:09:33,784 --> 00:09:36,172
My family picked the wrong
fight with the wrong people

47
00:09:36,197 --> 00:09:37,602
a long time ago.

48
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,679
It's like I told you, I'm alone.

49
00:09:52,296 --> 00:09:53,709
You're filthy.

50
00:10:53,148 --> 00:10:54,017
Up.

51
00:10:59,914 --> 00:11:01,103
Again!

52
00:11:01,642 --> 00:11:02,830
The others.

53
00:11:03,951 --> 00:11:05,330
Are they still out there?

54
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,470
Hmm?

55
00:11:07,091 --> 00:11:08,564
Are they close?

56
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,845
I don't know.

57
00:11:12,488 --> 00:11:14,228
Who's the leader?

58
00:11:14,522 --> 00:11:15,828
Is it the woman?

59
00:11:18,168 --> 00:11:19,430
I ain't one of them.

60
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:20,337
Bullshit.

61
00:11:32,353 --> 00:11:33,450
Enough.

62
00:11:35,072 --> 00:11:35,981
Shaw?

63
00:11:38,189 --> 00:11:39,529
I said stop.

64
00:11:40,224 --> 00:11:41,412
I'll handle him.

65
00:11:41,693 --> 00:11:44,000
He'll crack. I just
need a little more time.

66
00:11:44,025 --> 00:11:45,889
I've given you
enough time already.

67
00:11:47,154 --> 00:11:49,639
I said up!

68
00:12:06,082 --> 00:12:07,663
I need you to cooperate.

69
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:09,812
I told you everything.

70
00:12:09,988 --> 00:12:11,241
You told us nothing.

71
00:12:15,119 --> 00:12:15,888
Talk.

72
00:12:23,064 --> 00:12:25,415
The one we answer
to won't be so nice.

73
00:12:30,463 --> 00:12:31,907
I traded with them.

74
00:12:32,682 --> 00:12:34,519
They gave me some food.

75
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,534
I hauled some gear.

76
00:12:37,577 --> 00:12:39,277
I knew them less than a week.

77
00:12:42,472 --> 00:12:43,472
Unh-unh.

78
00:12:44,857 --> 00:12:46,777
Go ahead, kill me if you want.

79
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,542
I got nothing else to say.

80
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,639
 Should've
never brought him back.

81
00:13:18,183 --> 00:13:19,532
I know what I'm doing.

82
00:13:19,686 --> 00:13:21,253
Yeah, you keep saying that.

83
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:24,927
Daryl?

84
00:14:26,361 --> 00:14:27,404
Is that you?

85
00:14:31,134 --> 00:14:33,190
The others? Are they okay?

86
00:14:34,502 --> 00:14:36,573
I don't know where
your friends are.

87
00:14:37,277 --> 00:14:38,768
I don't care, neither.

88
00:14:39,887 --> 00:14:41,933
But I... But nothing.

89
00:14:42,222 --> 00:14:43,885
Just 'cause we
shared a bag of grain

90
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:46,003
does not make me give
a shit about you.

91
00:14:47,121 --> 00:14:48,620
Understand?

92
00:14:49,837 --> 00:14:52,088
Whatever beef you have
with these people,

93
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:54,292
I want no part of it.

94
00:14:55,329 --> 00:14:56,253
You hear me?

95
00:14:58,508 --> 00:14:59,729
You need to shut up

96
00:15:01,063 --> 00:15:02,417
and leave me alone.

97
00:15:05,477 --> 00:15:06,442
Got it?

98
00:15:10,452 --> 00:15:12,131
I got it, yeah.

99
00:15:14,185 --> 00:15:15,881
I was right about you.

100
00:15:16,773 --> 00:15:18,644
Shoulda let you starve.

101
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,725
Asshole.

102
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,058
I ain't telling you
bastards a thing.

103
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:40,488
Get up. Get up!

104
00:15:45,658 --> 00:15:47,226
Let me go!

105
00:16:16,153 --> 00:16:17,894
Just as stubborn as ever.

106
00:16:22,521 --> 00:16:24,175
Is that what you think this is?

107
00:16:24,218 --> 00:16:25,480
Hmm?

108
00:16:25,524 --> 00:16:27,037
Me being stubborn?

109
00:16:28,834 --> 00:16:29,802
Fine.

110
00:16:31,403 --> 00:16:32,304
Hard-headed.

111
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,682
You need to tell me the truth.

112
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:39,188
I've never lied to you.

113
00:16:40,631 --> 00:16:42,063
Never, Leah.

114
00:16:44,714 --> 00:16:46,173
I'm not gonna start now.

115
00:16:48,627 --> 00:16:50,069
Let's try this again.

116
00:16:53,938 --> 00:16:55,896
What do you know
about those people?

117
00:16:55,921 --> 00:16:57,368
I don't know shit.

118
00:16:59,556 --> 00:17:01,039
I'd help you if I could.

119
00:17:01,064 --> 00:17:01,960
You know I would.

120
00:17:03,512 --> 00:17:05,509
Just give me Dog, let me go,

121
00:17:06,173 --> 00:17:07,509
you'll never see me again.

122
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:09,735
Is that what you want?

123
00:17:25,497 --> 00:17:26,610
What is it?

124
00:17:29,308 --> 00:17:30,595
Found Bossie.

125
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:33,540
And Turner?

126
00:18:26,427 --> 00:18:29,343
 I tried. I
couldn't save him.

127
00:18:31,144 --> 00:18:33,146
I tried. Pope: It's okay, son.

128
00:18:33,171 --> 00:18:34,827
You did the right thing.

129
00:18:35,828 --> 00:18:37,534
You brought him home.

130
00:18:45,344 --> 00:18:48,695
 Lord, we release
our brother Turner to you.

131
00:18:48,841 --> 00:18:51,800
Please, hold him close.

132
00:19:18,342 --> 00:19:20,202
In your name, oh Lord, amen.

133
00:19:20,227 --> 00:19:21,460
Amen.

134
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:42,599
God is here.

135
00:19:46,668 --> 00:19:48,217
He's angry.

136
00:19:53,863 --> 00:19:54,893
I'm angry.

137
00:19:58,171 --> 00:19:59,885
Do you feel that?

138
00:20:00,434 --> 00:20:01,440
Hmm?

139
00:20:04,584 --> 00:20:07,674
Go make them feel our wrath.

140
00:21:04,292 --> 00:21:05,432
What happened?

141
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:08,539
One of my brothers is dead.

142
00:21:11,047 --> 00:21:13,088
Michael Turner was his name.

143
00:21:14,237 --> 00:21:16,190
We fought all over
the world together.

144
00:21:17,201 --> 00:21:19,213
Pope brought him in
after our last tour,

145
00:21:19,289 --> 00:21:20,862
when he started his company.

146
00:21:22,647 --> 00:21:24,370
I thought you were soldiers.

147
00:21:24,779 --> 00:21:26,166
We were.

148
00:21:27,293 --> 00:21:28,893
Then we went private.

149
00:21:30,308 --> 00:21:32,092
You didn't tell me
you were a merc.

150
00:21:32,117 --> 00:21:33,643
Mm, does it matter?

151
00:21:34,039 --> 00:21:36,172
I mean, it's the same damn job.

152
00:21:39,286 --> 00:21:41,853
Except we could
actually pay our bills.

153
00:21:48,831 --> 00:21:50,149
Michael was like me, you know?

154
00:21:50,174 --> 00:21:51,438
He didn't have a family.

155
00:21:51,463 --> 00:21:53,315
He was the little
brother I never had.

156
00:21:53,672 --> 00:21:56,196
You know, the little
brother I always wanted.

157
00:21:59,462 --> 00:22:00,646
And he's dead.

158
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:06,688
You know, we lost
a lot of people

159
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:09,227
here, and it's been hard.

160
00:22:11,716 --> 00:22:13,283
Not like this.

161
00:22:13,437 --> 00:22:14,548
This is the first time

162
00:22:14,573 --> 00:22:16,880
I've lost someone close
to me in a long time.

163
00:22:22,366 --> 00:22:23,192
Well

164
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,068
except maybe for you.

165
00:22:30,443 --> 00:22:32,196
You didn't lose me.

166
00:22:33,665 --> 00:22:35,033
I came back and you were gone.

167
00:22:40,687 --> 00:22:41,903
You left me.

168
00:22:43,556 --> 00:22:45,622
I asked you what you wanted.

169
00:22:46,435 --> 00:22:47,684
You left.

170
00:22:50,985 --> 00:22:52,380
I got scared.

171
00:22:54,335 --> 00:22:55,606
Of what?

172
00:22:58,615 --> 00:22:59,841
Letting go.

173
00:23:19,591 --> 00:23:22,473
It doesn't matter. It
wouldn't have worked anyway.

174
00:23:22,896 --> 00:23:24,071
Couldn't have been happy.

175
00:23:24,207 --> 00:23:26,075
Not in a world like this.

176
00:23:27,832 --> 00:23:29,895
Is that you talking
or your family?

177
00:23:32,777 --> 00:23:34,489
Like you've never done things?

178
00:23:35,185 --> 00:23:36,327
Killed people.

179
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:38,733
I know the things you've done.

180
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:41,495
You have no right to
judge, not at all.

181
00:23:44,092 --> 00:23:46,210
This is me, Daryl.

182
00:23:46,834 --> 00:23:48,342
The good and the bad.

183
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,428
All of it. It always has been.

184
00:23:51,787 --> 00:23:52,990
I don't believe you.

185
00:23:55,924 --> 00:23:57,225
Well, I can't help with that.

186
00:24:04,373 --> 00:24:06,614
But I can help
you save yourself.

187
00:24:07,725 --> 00:24:10,998
Because despite everything,
I still care about you,

188
00:24:11,023 --> 00:24:13,410
and I don't want anything
bad to happen to you.

189
00:24:16,947 --> 00:24:18,490
So, you need to
tell me something.

190
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:21,171
Anything.

191
00:24:21,369 --> 00:24:24,346
'Cause if you can't, I
can't control my commander

192
00:24:24,371 --> 00:24:26,077
or what he will do next.

193
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:29,460
He's angry about Turner,

194
00:24:30,835 --> 00:24:32,702
and he wants someone to pay.

195
00:24:40,324 --> 00:24:41,490
There's a woman.

196
00:24:43,085 --> 00:24:44,444
She's the leader.

197
00:24:47,589 --> 00:24:51,202
They were speaking in code
'cause I was an outsider.

198
00:24:51,808 --> 00:24:53,811
There was a tall, skinny guy.

199
00:24:53,925 --> 00:24:55,436
Never shuts up.

200
00:24:57,947 --> 00:24:59,975
And a priest who
carries a shotgun.

201
00:25:00,547 --> 00:25:02,201
That's their leadership?

202
00:25:02,226 --> 00:25:04,624
Yeah. But they have the numbers.

203
00:25:05,397 --> 00:25:06,845
And one of their
soldiers slipped up,

204
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:09,538
and he was gonna go meet
three dozen of their fighters.

205
00:25:09,961 --> 00:25:12,116
That's way more than the
15 you got here.

206
00:25:12,141 --> 00:25:15,014
Well, you've been doing
your work down here, huh?

207
00:25:26,373 --> 00:25:28,175
I'm gonna get you out of here

208
00:25:29,413 --> 00:25:31,230
so you can be more comfortable.

209
00:25:37,982 --> 00:25:39,200
When do I meet him?

210
00:25:40,034 --> 00:25:41,155
This Pope?

211
00:25:43,037 --> 00:25:43,991
Soon.

212
00:26:06,495 --> 00:26:07,763
Well, you were right.

213
00:26:09,125 --> 00:26:10,778
He was hard to break.

214
00:26:13,245 --> 00:26:15,732
He told me there are a lot
more out there than we thought.

215
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,974
More than twice the
force we have in here.

216
00:26:25,471 --> 00:26:27,244
I think he'll be good here.

217
00:26:29,301 --> 00:26:31,376
And we need the manpower,

218
00:26:32,323 --> 00:26:33,672
with Turner gone

219
00:26:33,861 --> 00:26:35,892
and Nicholls and
Montanio still missing.

220
00:26:43,886 --> 00:26:44,981
Say something.

221
00:26:45,638 --> 00:26:47,145
You know I hate it
when you do this.

222
00:26:48,757 --> 00:26:49,903
Do what?

223
00:26:50,737 --> 00:26:52,137
Freeze me out.

224
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:57,161
Not everything is
about you, Leah.

225
00:26:59,113 --> 00:27:00,506
I never said it was.

226
00:27:00,549 --> 00:27:02,137
Oh, no?

227
00:27:03,741 --> 00:27:05,160
'Cause here we are.

228
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:08,041
Losing a day of
tracking our enemy

229
00:27:08,066 --> 00:27:12,383
'cause you... you had to
go on a fishing expedition

230
00:27:12,408 --> 00:27:14,106
with an old boyfriend.

231
00:27:38,276 --> 00:27:39,502
So, go on, then.

232
00:27:39,553 --> 00:27:40,626
Tell me.

233
00:27:43,545 --> 00:27:45,252
You find what
you're looking for?

234
00:27:50,446 --> 00:27:52,804
I told you he would be
useful, and I was right.

235
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:55,411
He's a lot like us.

236
00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:59,262
Pain doesn't scare him,
death doesn't scare him.

237
00:28:00,174 --> 00:28:01,333
Carver saw it.

238
00:28:03,395 --> 00:28:04,840
Come on, you see it.

239
00:28:05,702 --> 00:28:08,708
I just see a guy who wants
to get in your pants.

240
00:28:10,184 --> 00:28:11,184
Fine.

241
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:13,903
Fine.

242
00:28:14,798 --> 00:28:17,950
Who couldn't stop gazing
at somebody he loved.

243
00:28:20,574 --> 00:28:22,387
I never said he loved me.

244
00:28:22,933 --> 00:28:23,856
Oh.

245
00:28:25,316 --> 00:28:28,511
You could've ended
him out there today,

246
00:28:28,966 --> 00:28:30,200
and you didn't.

247
00:28:32,059 --> 00:28:33,044
Why?

248
00:28:34,903 --> 00:28:37,386
At one point, he meant
something to me, yeah.

249
00:28:39,168 --> 00:28:40,778
I've been open about that.

250
00:28:43,628 --> 00:28:46,503
But it ended the
day you found me

251
00:28:46,528 --> 00:28:48,023
and I chose this family,

252
00:28:48,048 --> 00:28:51,008
and I have never once
regretted that decision,

253
00:28:51,051 --> 00:28:52,934
and I don't want you to, either.

254
00:28:54,228 --> 00:28:55,114
Do you?

255
00:29:08,721 --> 00:29:10,310
I believe in you.

256
00:29:13,971 --> 00:29:15,435
More than the others.

257
00:29:18,656 --> 00:29:19,794
I know.

258
00:29:22,551 --> 00:29:24,458
You think we can trust him?

259
00:29:26,043 --> 00:29:26,983
Yeah.

260
00:29:31,091 --> 00:29:31,928
Good.

261
00:29:33,702 --> 00:29:35,452
Now, let me see for myself.

262
00:29:39,676 --> 00:29:41,524
You got something to say?

263
00:29:42,609 --> 00:29:43,571
Come on,man.

264
00:29:44,376 --> 00:29:46,516
Don't be shy.You're about to meet the man.

265
00:29:46,541 --> 00:29:49,224
Yeah, save that coy shit
for your girlfriend.

266
00:29:49,249 --> 00:29:51,555
Aww, Shaw ain't
nobody's girlfriend.

267
00:29:51,895 --> 00:29:54,618
I'm betting she wears the
pants with homeboy here.

268
00:29:54,898 --> 00:29:56,203
Isn't that right?

269
00:29:56,247 --> 00:29:57,831
You don't know shit
about shit, Carver.

270
00:29:57,857 --> 00:29:59,126
Knock it off.

271
00:30:01,725 --> 00:30:03,857
I guess I'll just show
my dumb ass out, then.

272
00:30:15,328 --> 00:30:16,797
Pope is on his way.

273
00:30:16,822 --> 00:30:18,914
Anything you wanna tell me about
this guy before I meet him?

274
00:30:19,792 --> 00:30:21,489
Just follow my lead.

275
00:30:33,371 --> 00:30:34,076
Hey!

276
00:30:55,757 --> 00:30:56,686
Aah!

277
00:30:57,569 --> 00:30:59,353
Here! Take it! Take it!

278
00:31:10,614 --> 00:31:11,559
Aah!

279
00:31:12,028 --> 00:31:12,954
Aah!

280
00:31:13,058 --> 00:31:15,208
Here! Here!

281
00:31:42,778 --> 00:31:43,676
 Come on.

282
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:45,668
Forged by fire.

283
00:32:47,374 --> 00:32:50,637
Ordained by God.

284
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:53,699
Welcome him!

285
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:56,196
Fortitudo Saludis!

286
00:33:04,708 --> 00:33:05,931
 You believe in God?

287
00:33:08,482 --> 00:33:10,681
No. No, I don't.

288
00:33:12,043 --> 00:33:13,165
Not anymore.

289
00:33:14,189 --> 00:33:15,930
Guess I just believe in me now.

290
00:33:15,955 --> 00:33:16,619
Hmm.

291
00:33:17,215 --> 00:33:18,400
Well, that's a mistake.

292
00:33:19,786 --> 00:33:21,767
Why's that?'Cause
you're not Him.

293
00:33:23,467 --> 00:33:25,580
I passed your little
test, didn't I?

294
00:33:25,832 --> 00:33:27,138
Whatever you want to call it.

295
00:33:27,284 --> 00:33:29,260
Oh, and you think
that's the end of it?

296
00:33:31,003 --> 00:33:32,431
What else
do you want from me?

297
00:33:33,869 --> 00:33:35,150
I want...

298
00:33:38,026 --> 00:33:39,892
I want you to understand.

299
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:51,763
Sit down.

300
00:33:56,574 --> 00:34:01,127
We all met in the
Valley of Death.

301
00:34:01,927 --> 00:34:04,284
That's what we call it, anyway.

302
00:34:05,017 --> 00:34:07,065
Hills of Afghanistan.

303
00:34:07,408 --> 00:34:09,112
We fought for our country,

304
00:34:09,587 --> 00:34:12,010
carried our fallen
brothers off the field.

305
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:15,146
Carried so many, we lost
count after a while.

306
00:34:19,553 --> 00:34:21,117
Politicians.

307
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,109
They wrote the checks.

308
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,341
We weren't anything to them.

309
00:34:28,471 --> 00:34:30,031
Just props.

310
00:34:30,621 --> 00:34:32,867
Props for their next campaign.

311
00:34:33,082 --> 00:34:36,389
See, they... They
talked about God.

312
00:34:38,158 --> 00:34:39,836
They didn't know God.

313
00:34:40,373 --> 00:34:42,399
They never saw His face.

314
00:34:43,316 --> 00:34:45,031
It's not like we did.

315
00:34:45,536 --> 00:34:48,524
We saw God everywhere.

316
00:34:49,627 --> 00:34:52,906
He was in the blood and
the horror and death.

317
00:34:53,767 --> 00:34:55,054
He was there,

318
00:34:55,991 --> 00:34:57,547
telling
us where to go.

319
00:35:00,507 --> 00:35:04,729
Didn't have much else to hold
on to in those days but Him.

320
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,987
And each other.

321
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:12,198
You smoke?

322
00:35:27,539 --> 00:35:28,745
That war...

323
00:35:29,721 --> 00:35:32,588
damn near ruined
all of us for good.

324
00:35:32,948 --> 00:35:36,759
Came home and my guys
had permanent injuries.

325
00:35:36,784 --> 00:35:38,151
They couldn't sleep.

326
00:35:38,176 --> 00:35:39,917
They couldn't find real jobs.

327
00:35:42,419 --> 00:35:43,252
So

328
00:35:45,817 --> 00:35:47,714
people called us mercenaries.

329
00:35:49,877 --> 00:35:52,491
We did all the ugly, dirty work

330
00:35:52,516 --> 00:35:54,456
nobody else wanted to do.

331
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:57,269
Got paid for it, too.

332
00:35:57,296 --> 00:35:58,510
Handsomely.

333
00:36:03,483 --> 00:36:06,427
The real dirty work
started after the Fall.

334
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,277
Never been in a war like that.

335
00:36:18,106 --> 00:36:21,636
Never seen that kind of chaos,

336
00:36:21,885 --> 00:36:25,149
and I had seen everything.

337
00:36:27,246 --> 00:36:28,606
But this...

338
00:36:32,904 --> 00:36:35,008
Oh, the things we did.

339
00:36:37,664 --> 00:36:42,039
All that death, day
after day after day...

340
00:36:43,741 --> 00:36:47,086
After a while, I started
to feel like you.

341
00:36:49,137 --> 00:36:53,011
Wondering... Wondering
where God was.

342
00:36:55,039 --> 00:36:56,805
Until He showed His face again.

343
00:36:57,189 --> 00:37:00,727
See, politicians... they had
one last war to get behind.

344
00:37:00,752 --> 00:37:04,414
This time, coming for us.

345
00:37:07,633 --> 00:37:09,702
The bombs came thick and fast.

346
00:37:11,725 --> 00:37:13,086
It did not stop.

347
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:16,086
We lost some of our own,

348
00:37:16,111 --> 00:37:19,940
had to run through
the fire to save them.

349
00:37:22,345 --> 00:37:24,782
Found this little church
at the edge of town,

350
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:26,523
and we holed up there
as everything...

351
00:37:26,566 --> 00:37:32,137
And I mean everything...
Burned around us.

352
00:37:33,921 --> 00:37:36,750
When the fires
finally died down,

353
00:37:36,794 --> 00:37:38,570
I looked at my people...

354
00:37:40,889 --> 00:37:43,086
I could not believe it.

355
00:37:45,237 --> 00:37:47,336
Not a trace of blood.

356
00:37:48,748 --> 00:37:50,023
No burn marks.

357
00:37:51,504 --> 00:37:54,031
Not even a scratch.

358
00:37:55,805 --> 00:37:57,312
And that's when I knew.

359
00:38:02,584 --> 00:38:05,202
We were the Chosen Ones.

360
00:38:08,435 --> 00:38:09,772
These men...

361
00:38:10,491 --> 00:38:15,191
These men upon whose bodies
the fire had no power.

362
00:38:21,332 --> 00:38:23,275
God chose you tonight.

363
00:38:24,581 --> 00:38:27,759
I mean, you... You
came out of that fire

364
00:38:27,784 --> 00:38:30,454
alive and whole.

365
00:38:31,172 --> 00:38:33,923
And look at you now,
sitting right here.

366
00:38:34,611 --> 00:38:35,595
Are you hurt?

367
00:38:36,132 --> 00:38:36,970
Hmm?

368
00:38:37,526 --> 00:38:38,446
Any burns?

369
00:38:39,716 --> 00:38:40,978
A scratch?

370
00:38:44,353 --> 00:38:45,853
I've been through worse before.

371
00:38:54,142 --> 00:38:58,590
Are. You. Hungry?

372
00:39:32,058 --> 00:39:33,105
You were right.

373
00:39:33,314 --> 00:39:34,386
About this one.

374
00:39:35,453 --> 00:39:36,504
Of course I was.

375
00:39:40,308 --> 00:39:41,629
Give him some, Bossie.

376
00:39:42,441 --> 00:39:43,730
Don't be greedy.

377
00:39:45,096 --> 00:39:46,457
He's family now.

378
00:39:53,713 --> 00:39:57,674
You know what he did, don't you?

379
00:39:57,888 --> 00:40:01,835
He walked 10 miles with his
dead brother on his back.

380
00:40:02,896 --> 00:40:03,961
10 miles.

381
00:40:05,803 --> 00:40:07,304
The strength that took...

382
00:40:09,826 --> 00:40:12,164
You have any idea
how grateful we are?

383
00:40:15,361 --> 00:40:17,712
Turner will have
a proper burial.

384
00:40:17,737 --> 00:40:20,582
Just did what any one
of us would've done.

385
00:40:22,525 --> 00:40:23,261
Mm.

386
00:40:30,595 --> 00:40:31,671
These still hurt?

387
00:40:31,969 --> 00:40:32,632
Hmm?

388
00:40:34,145 --> 00:40:35,476
You need anything?

389
00:40:42,196 --> 00:40:44,101
I just have one question.

390
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:46,468
S-Sure.

391
00:40:47,811 --> 00:40:49,515
Something's been bothering me.

392
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:52,570
Your wounds

393
00:40:53,877 --> 00:40:55,187
are on your back.

394
00:40:55,212 --> 00:40:58,148
Pope, it's been a rough day.

395
00:40:58,325 --> 00:41:00,408
Just getting clarity, Shaw.

396
00:41:05,342 --> 00:41:08,328
Where were you when
Turner was being attacked?

397
00:41:08,353 --> 00:41:10,062
I-I was right there,
just like I told you.

398
00:41:10,087 --> 00:41:11,089
Uh-huh.

399
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:13,550
Facing the enemy?

400
00:41:14,577 --> 00:41:15,472
Yeah.

401
00:41:15,693 --> 00:41:17,049
Leah: He's been through enough.

402
00:41:28,224 --> 00:41:31,456
Human nature is to run
when you are scared.

403
00:41:32,377 --> 00:41:34,347
You know what
that's like, right?

404
00:41:38,775 --> 00:41:40,875
It takes divine strength...

405
00:41:41,327 --> 00:41:43,327
to face your fear head-on

406
00:41:44,432 --> 00:41:47,101
Risk everything
for someone else.

407
00:41:48,336 --> 00:41:50,499
We all saw what you did.

408
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:52,720
Getting Shaw out
of the fire first,

409
00:41:52,745 --> 00:41:55,117
and you felt it, huh?

410
00:41:56,157 --> 00:42:00,596
How far he would go
just to keep you safe.

411
00:42:02,031 --> 00:42:06,905
Today, God baptized
you in that fire.

412
00:42:09,099 --> 00:42:11,393
Made you one of us.

413
00:42:14,077 --> 00:42:15,283
You see

414
00:42:16,592 --> 00:42:19,698
there's one thing I
forgot to tell you.

415
00:42:20,350 --> 00:42:22,614
Never turn your back
on your brother.

416
00:42:28,478 --> 00:42:31,799
God doesn't only use
fire as His baptism.

417
00:42:37,007 --> 00:42:38,614
It's also His wrath.

418
00:42:43,437 --> 00:42:44,414
Aah!

419
00:43:05,217 --> 00:43:07,185
We are the Chosen Ones!

420
00:43:09,221 --> 00:43:12,420
We run into the battle.

421
00:43:12,823 --> 00:43:15,434
We run into the fire.

422
00:43:19,631 --> 00:43:21,631
Always.

423
00:43:44,879 --> 00:43:45,823
 We can't stay.

424
00:43:47,537 --> 00:43:49,162
We need to help our friends.

425
00:43:49,270 --> 00:43:50,082
I want to help.

426
00:43:50,896 --> 00:43:51,865
Are you sure?

427
00:43:52,356 --> 00:43:53,388
This is our home.

428
00:43:54,229 --> 00:43:55,368
We got to fight to save it.

429
00:43:58,285 --> 00:44:00,827
The only way this works
is if we trust each other.

430
00:44:18,412 --> 00:44:20,173
 When we see the
Reapers, they're in these

431
00:44:20,197 --> 00:44:22,373
crazy, scary masks.

432
00:44:22,416 --> 00:44:25,332
Our inspiration for these
was sort of a mish-mash

433
00:44:25,376 --> 00:44:26,769
of different influences.

434
00:44:26,812 --> 00:44:29,815
Military can sometimes
have tactical masks.

435
00:44:29,859 --> 00:44:32,557
And sometimes they do
have things like skulls

436
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:34,602
or interesting designs on them.

437
00:44:34,646 --> 00:44:37,301
And then we were also just
looking at different kinds

438
00:44:37,344 --> 00:44:42,045
of post-apocalyptic concept
art, video games, to just things

439
00:44:42,088 --> 00:44:45,396
that are written about with
people in gas masks and stuff.

440
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:47,877
And, when we were thinking
about, like, what is the look

441
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:51,750
of this crew, they're
almost like these faceless

442
00:44:51,794 --> 00:44:53,926
people that come in
like the Grim Reaper.

443
00:44:55,841 --> 00:44:58,929
Because of Dog being
separated from Daryl,

444
00:44:58,954 --> 00:45:01,843
he chases Dog and finds
the dog with this Reaper.

445
00:45:01,868 --> 00:45:04,763
And it turns out
the Reaper is Leah.

446
00:45:05,047 --> 00:45:08,027
We had always planned
for that to be the story.

447
00:45:08,071 --> 00:45:09,855
This is not a story
we came up with

448
00:45:09,899 --> 00:45:13,598
after that first episode
with Daryl and Leah aired.

449
00:45:13,641 --> 00:45:15,861
And, also, a lot
of time has passed.

450
00:45:15,905 --> 00:45:19,256
So, there's obviously a
story that has happened

451
00:45:19,299 --> 00:45:21,214
in the interim and
when they kinda

452
00:45:21,258 --> 00:45:23,564
crash into each other,
there's a whole lot

453
00:45:23,608 --> 00:45:25,697
that's going on
through Daryl's head.

454
00:45:25,741 --> 00:45:28,831
But the first thing is, "I
gotta lie to get out of it."

455
00:45:28,874 --> 00:45:31,442
Like, whatever I have to say
to do to get out of this,

456
00:45:31,485 --> 00:45:33,792
like, I'm gonna leverage
that little bit of trust

457
00:45:33,836 --> 00:45:36,229
that she has in me,
to help my people.

458
00:45:36,273 --> 00:45:39,798
Because as soon as he sees
her on the other side of this,

459
00:45:39,842 --> 00:45:42,845
he's like, "Okay, maybe
I was wrong about her",

460
00:45:42,888 --> 00:45:46,065
but I'm not really gonna hang
around to try to figure it out.

461
00:45:46,109 --> 00:45:47,806
Look, I don't know
who you're fightin'

462
00:45:47,850 --> 00:45:49,634
but I am not part of it.

463
00:45:53,507 --> 00:45:56,119
The way that we always
thought about this group

464
00:45:56,162 --> 00:46:00,427
is that they probably have a
series of things that they do

465
00:46:00,471 --> 00:46:04,257
when they come across what would
be enemy combatants to them.

466
00:46:04,301 --> 00:46:07,826
They were all, basically
like, military contractors

467
00:46:07,870 --> 00:46:09,828
or what some would
call mercenaries.

468
00:46:09,872 --> 00:46:14,702
And they were doing these things
at a time when there was a lot

469
00:46:14,746 --> 00:46:17,183
of torture that was,
sort of, like, sanctioned

470
00:46:17,227 --> 00:46:19,707
in the military, so
they've all learned

471
00:46:19,751 --> 00:46:21,418
those techniques and
became very familiar

472
00:46:21,448 --> 00:46:23,494
with them before the world fell.

473
00:46:23,537 --> 00:46:25,844
And so for The Reapers,

474
00:46:25,888 --> 00:46:27,890
this is just part of
what they have to do.

475
00:46:27,933 --> 00:46:31,632
And I think Leah is a character
that she can't be seen

476
00:46:31,676 --> 00:46:34,287
to be showing any
softness towards anybody.

477
00:46:34,331 --> 00:46:38,726
She is part of this group and
she answers to somebody else.

478
00:46:38,770 --> 00:46:42,078
So, she may be the
one, at least in name,

479
00:46:42,121 --> 00:46:45,037
in charge of the situation,
but I think that question

480
00:46:45,081 --> 00:46:47,561
sits out there, like,
is she really in charge

481
00:46:47,605 --> 00:46:49,955
of this situation or
has she been asked to

482
00:46:49,999 --> 00:46:52,740
carry out orders and she
feels that she needs to?

483
00:46:52,784 --> 00:46:55,004
She doesn't love what
she's seeing, you know,

484
00:46:55,047 --> 00:46:57,920
and she puts a stop
to it or a pause to it

485
00:46:57,963 --> 00:47:01,097
when it feels like it's
going too far or too long.

486
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:04,361
So there's just a lot
of complicated emotions

487
00:47:04,404 --> 00:47:06,232
that are running
through the whole thing.

488
00:47:06,276 --> 00:47:08,479
The one we answer
to won't be so nice.

489
00:47:10,428 --> 00:47:13,388
We got really fortunate
in casting Ritchie Coster

490
00:47:13,413 --> 00:47:14,762
in this role as Pope.

491
00:47:14,806 --> 00:47:17,374
He just had a take
on it right away.

492
00:47:17,417 --> 00:47:19,811
When we were developing
this character,

493
00:47:19,855 --> 00:47:23,771
one of the things that we
talked about is just this idea

494
00:47:23,815 --> 00:47:26,339
of being chosen
and what that can,

495
00:47:26,383 --> 00:47:30,343
in the most extreme
versions, cause people to do.

496
00:47:30,387 --> 00:47:33,738
For Pope, we just felt
that it'd be interesting to

497
00:47:33,781 --> 00:47:36,567
kind of illustrate somebody who

498
00:47:36,610 --> 00:47:38,961
probably was a
brilliant tactical mind,

499
00:47:39,004 --> 00:47:43,008
was probably a really
great commander,

500
00:47:43,052 --> 00:47:46,969
and yet, became kind of
disgruntled by the system

501
00:47:47,012 --> 00:47:49,928
and felt left
behind in some ways.

502
00:47:49,972 --> 00:47:53,192
And saw people that he
felt were left behind.

503
00:47:53,236 --> 00:47:56,717
There was this story, this
thing that felt miraculous

504
00:47:56,761 --> 00:47:58,850
happened, which is
actually not that uncommon.

505
00:47:58,894 --> 00:48:01,157
Which is that, sometimes,
you're in a building

506
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:04,377
in a raging fire and the
fire jumps your building.

507
00:48:04,421 --> 00:48:09,121
That's when I knew we
were the chosen ones.

508
00:48:09,165 --> 00:48:12,385
God had spared them all
for something important

509
00:48:12,429 --> 00:48:14,822
and that made him feel
like he needed to go

510
00:48:14,866 --> 00:48:18,348
throughout this after time
and grab what they needed

511
00:48:18,391 --> 00:48:19,871
on behalf of his people.

512
00:48:19,915 --> 00:48:21,829
And, you know, in
many ways he has been

513
00:48:21,873 --> 00:48:23,657
an effective leader
of his people

514
00:48:23,701 --> 00:48:25,529
in that he has kept
them safe and alive,

515
00:48:25,572 --> 00:48:27,313
but at what cost
to anybody else?

516
00:48:29,402 --> 00:48:35,644
This idea of a trial by fire
just felt like this divine test.

517
00:48:35,669 --> 00:48:39,456
We felt like that was just a
very dramatic way to illustrate

518
00:48:39,499 --> 00:48:42,546
the type of danger that
they're all in but Leah, too.

519
00:48:42,589 --> 00:48:45,027
For whatever it's worth,
there is a kind of

520
00:48:45,070 --> 00:48:47,638
a turning point for Leah
in that moment as well.

521
00:48:47,681 --> 00:48:51,033
Because it's one thing to
be inside the circle of love

522
00:48:51,076 --> 00:48:53,644
and to feel like she's
one of his favorites

523
00:48:53,687 --> 00:48:57,003
and he sees her as a daughter,
but what kind of father

524
00:48:57,028 --> 00:48:59,693
sticks their daughter in a
room and sets it on fire?

525
00:48:59,737 --> 00:49:01,652
With, like, no obvious
way to get out?

526
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:04,263
That is super, super intense.

527
00:49:04,307 --> 00:49:06,874
And so, for both of
these characters,

528
00:49:06,918 --> 00:49:10,704
they kinda come out of this
and Pope intends for them

529
00:49:10,748 --> 00:49:13,881
to come out feeling like
changed people and they do

530
00:49:13,925 --> 00:49:17,015
but maybe not in the way that
he's thinking is gonna happen.

531
00:49:20,932 --> 00:49:23,717
In this scene where he puts
Bossy's head in the fire,

532
00:49:23,761 --> 00:49:26,285
we wanted to kind of
show a few things.

533
00:49:26,329 --> 00:49:29,854
One is that, you know, in
the apocalypse we've seen

534
00:49:29,897 --> 00:49:32,074
our characters,
we've seen villains,

535
00:49:32,117 --> 00:49:35,077
we've seen a lot of them do
some pretty intense things.

536
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:37,514
And, the question is,
who are the people

537
00:49:37,557 --> 00:49:39,037
that are gonna stand up to that

538
00:49:39,081 --> 00:49:41,431
and who is just gonna
try to live with it

539
00:49:41,474 --> 00:49:45,826
and who is complicit in
it who is cheering it on?

540
00:49:45,870 --> 00:49:49,308
Daryl's just kind of
coming into this situation

541
00:49:49,352 --> 00:49:53,747
knowing very little about
them and he's still learning

542
00:49:53,791 --> 00:49:56,054
what all of it means and
where they all stand.

543
00:49:56,098 --> 00:49:58,230
And the big lesson
out of this is

544
00:49:58,274 --> 00:50:01,277
nobody's gonna stand
up to Pope easily.

545
00:50:05,150 --> 00:50:08,719
I think for some of
them it's a wake-up call

546
00:50:08,762 --> 00:50:12,679
to realize, like, how intense
the situation has gotten.

547
00:50:12,723 --> 00:50:15,421
I don't actually
think Pope has killed

548
00:50:15,465 --> 00:50:18,337
a lot of his own
people in this way.

549
00:50:18,381 --> 00:50:21,297
I think it's always been, like,
"It's us against the world."

550
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:24,735
And now that he's put
Leah in a burning room,

551
00:50:24,778 --> 00:50:28,652
just threw one of these people
that she considers, like,

552
00:50:28,695 --> 00:50:32,090
a brother in the fire,
the equation is shifting.

553
00:50:32,134 --> 00:50:34,136
And I think there's
a sense of unease.

554
00:50:34,179 --> 00:50:37,661
For Daryl, all of this is
intel that he's taking in

555
00:50:37,704 --> 00:50:40,098
and he's realizing, like,
I've gotta tread very,

556
00:50:40,142 --> 00:50:41,752
very carefully here.

557
00:50:41,795 --> 00:50:43,710
He's in a dangerous situation.

558
00:50:43,754 --> 00:50:45,538
We are the chosen ones!

559
00:50:45,582 --> 00:50:48,106
We run into the battle.

560
00:50:48,150 --> 00:50:51,153
We run into the fire!

561
00:50:51,196 --> 00:50:52,905
Always.

561
00:50:53,305 --> 00:51:53,679
