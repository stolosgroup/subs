Previously on "The
Walking Dead"...

2
00:00:01,691 --> 00:00:02,984
You need to see a doctor.

3
00:00:03,597 --> 00:00:06,171
I have a meeting with
Pamela Milton later.

4
00:00:06,216 --> 00:00:08,566
Someone like me would
never meet Ms. Milton.

5
00:00:08,591 --> 00:00:09,593
Why not?

6
00:00:09,618 --> 00:00:10,601
You have to know

7
00:00:10,626 --> 00:00:11,733
your place.

8
00:00:12,026 --> 00:00:13,548
Hey! I did nothing wrong,

9
00:00:13,573 --> 00:00:14,652
Hey! I swear!

10
00:00:15,331 --> 00:00:17,276
Oh, my God! What did you do?!

11
00:00:17,301 --> 00:00:18,648
Don't you know who that is?

12
00:00:18,673 --> 00:00:20,534
Got something coming!

13
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:22,244
Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.
Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.

14
00:00:22,268 --> 00:00:23,358
We're all friends.

15
00:00:23,478 --> 00:00:24,631
They're here to help.

16
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:26,747
You've fallen on hard times.

17
00:00:26,772 --> 00:00:29,335
I have an interesting
choice to offer.

Man, that's... that's enough.

20
00:01:26,387 --> 00:01:28,264
Yeah, man. No problem, man.

21
00:01:36,987 --> 00:01:39,076
Did great in there, buddy.

22
00:01:39,101 --> 00:01:40,781
You were very brave.

23
00:01:41,521 --> 00:01:43,045
H-Hey!

24
00:01:46,615 --> 00:01:49,382
Don't worry, li'l
dude. You're home, see?

25
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:51,398
Safe and sound.

26
00:01:52,169 --> 00:01:53,257
Apples?

27
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:57,787
Come on. Let's go take a look.

DAY 30 IN THE COMMONWEALTH

30
00:03:19,001 --> 00:03:20,397
Thank you.

31
00:03:25,348 --> 00:03:26,741
I'll take a witch hat.

32
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:30,582
Good choice. Thank you.

33
00:03:31,607 --> 00:03:34,261
Hey! You're one of
the new people, right?

34
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,417
I heard you all lived
out in the wasteland,

35
00:03:36,442 --> 00:03:37,660
killing rotters?

36
00:03:37,685 --> 00:03:39,075
Yeah, I guess.

37
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,209
Cool.

38
00:03:40,234 --> 00:03:42,341
So, there's probably nothing
you're afraid of, huh?

39
00:03:44,246 --> 00:03:46,727
Come on, I'll show you where
all the good candy's at.

40
00:03:46,901 --> 00:03:48,119
And I'm Mei.

41
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:49,145
Jude.

42
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:50,476
Cool name.

43
00:03:58,802 --> 00:04:00,574
So, uh, what do you think?

44
00:04:01,667 --> 00:04:04,246
It takes a minute to get
used to all this, you know?

45
00:04:04,271 --> 00:04:06,316
You know, this place
was up and running

46
00:04:06,341 --> 00:04:08,150
long before we ever got here.

47
00:04:08,175 --> 00:04:10,517
Maybe we don't have to do
anything to make it work.

48
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:13,846
No, there's always something
you got to do to make it work.

49
00:04:14,578 --> 00:04:15,900
Want another one?

50
00:04:19,142 --> 00:04:21,971
Oh, hello! Happy Halloween!

51
00:04:23,386 --> 00:04:25,997
And here's one for you...

52
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,571
and one for you.

53
00:04:27,912 --> 00:04:30,871
They're delicious, aren't
they? You like 'em?

54
00:04:33,255 --> 00:04:35,692
And first place goes to...

55
00:04:35,719 --> 00:04:38,993
dressed as our
very own Mercer...

56
00:04:39,018 --> 00:04:40,407
Celeste!

57
00:04:45,315 --> 00:04:48,704
And this year's
grand prize is...

58
00:04:49,568 --> 00:04:52,136
10 lottery tickets!

59
00:04:56,627 --> 00:04:58,572
Let's take some pictures.

60
00:04:59,247 --> 00:05:01,249
Thank you all for
coming out today.

61
00:05:01,293 --> 00:05:02,642
You all look fantastic,

62
00:05:02,667 --> 00:05:05,208
and I'm so happy you're
out here for Halloween.

63
00:05:05,417 --> 00:05:07,653
I always thought
she was so classy.

64
00:05:08,265 --> 00:05:10,255
I never knew anything about her.

65
00:05:11,108 --> 00:05:13,763
Mm, I used to read
a lot of tabloids.

66
00:05:15,462 --> 00:05:17,381
Hey! You two look busy.

67
00:05:18,383 --> 00:05:20,211
Connie's reporting
for the paper.

68
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:22,020
We've got a full day.

69
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:23,642
How's work?

70
00:05:24,924 --> 00:05:27,187
"It's nice to be
reporting again,

71
00:05:27,212 --> 00:05:29,910
but Commonwealth
news isn't exactly...

72
00:05:31,877 --> 00:05:33,286
hard-hitting."

73
00:05:33,926 --> 00:05:36,015
Have you, uh, met Pamela yet?

74
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:41,921
"I interviewed her once,
before the world fell."

75
00:05:41,946 --> 00:05:46,385
Yeah, and you also got her uncle
kicked out of Congress, so...

76
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:47,846
That was you?

77
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:54,531
"We gotta go.

78
00:05:54,556 --> 00:05:57,211
We have a lot to do before
the masquerade ball."

79
00:05:57,236 --> 00:05:58,368
See you later.

80
00:06:07,589 --> 00:06:09,161
You should ask her to dance.

81
00:06:10,755 --> 00:06:11,955
I gotta get to work.

82
00:06:12,332 --> 00:06:13,652
Hey. Catch up later?

83
00:06:13,677 --> 00:06:15,130
Yeah. See ya later.

84
00:06:31,536 --> 00:06:32,950
 Thanks
for watching Coco.

85
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:34,402
I'll come by tonight
to pick her up.

86
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:36,734
You know, why don't I
just keep her overnight?

87
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:39,769
You're sure to be exhausted
after the late shift.

88
00:06:40,357 --> 00:06:41,540
You sure?

89
00:06:41,565 --> 00:06:43,045
Yeah, of course.

90
00:06:45,092 --> 00:06:46,703
Okay, well, thank you.

91
00:06:46,728 --> 00:06:49,279
I'll, uh... I'll get her
before your Bible study.

92
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:50,684
Okay.

93
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:52,316
Shh, shh, shh.

94
00:06:52,341 --> 00:06:55,170
Aww! Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

95
00:06:55,551 --> 00:06:57,465
Thank you. Bye.

96
00:07:04,913 --> 00:07:05,929
Hi. Hey.

97
00:07:06,367 --> 00:07:08,530
How's the place? Getting
any better? Hell, no.

98
00:07:08,555 --> 00:07:10,731
No, I think this place is
literally made out of paper.

99
00:07:10,756 --> 00:07:11,844
You sleeping?

100
00:07:11,869 --> 00:07:13,915
Nah. No, no.

101
00:07:22,987 --> 00:07:25,859
Can't wait 'til basic's over
and we get new apartments

102
00:07:25,884 --> 00:07:27,929
Worrying about money
again is so weird.

103
00:07:27,984 --> 00:07:29,575
It's not forever.

104
00:07:30,544 --> 00:07:32,241
Ready, set, go!

105
00:07:33,837 --> 00:07:36,579
Tide's turning and
Ezra's back in the game!

106
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,624
Just when we
thought it was over.

107
00:07:38,668 --> 00:07:40,844
There is no telling
how this ends!

108
00:07:40,887 --> 00:07:42,241
Ezekiel, come play!

109
00:07:42,266 --> 00:07:43,663
Nothing I'd love more,

110
00:07:43,688 --> 00:07:45,559
but I gotta take care
of these little guys.

111
00:07:45,584 --> 00:07:47,150
- Us too.
- Okay.

112
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:49,524
Okay, okay, let's thank Ezekiel

113
00:07:49,549 --> 00:07:52,178
for letting us use
Shiva's collar, huh?

114
00:07:52,203 --> 00:07:54,606
It was the cherry on top of
that sweet costume, right?

115
00:07:57,513 --> 00:07:59,732
Sorry, bud. We
gotta give it back.

116
00:08:10,192 --> 00:08:11,724
You know, Ezra...

117
00:08:13,196 --> 00:08:16,504
your dad saved this from
Hilltop when it burned

118
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:18,575
because he knew how
precious it was to me.

119
00:08:19,012 --> 00:08:21,014
But there's something
actually more precious,

120
00:08:21,058 --> 00:08:22,911
and that is your family.

121
00:08:23,994 --> 00:08:27,427
So this leash is yours,
on two conditions. One,

122
00:08:27,452 --> 00:08:30,242
that it always makes you
as happy as it made me.

123
00:08:30,267 --> 00:08:33,574
And two, that you
honor Shiva's memory

124
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:36,185
and always think of her
when you play with it.

125
00:08:40,097 --> 00:08:41,664
You have fun, buddy.

126
00:08:41,848 --> 00:08:43,285
Ezekiel, you sure?

127
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:45,225
Yeah, just be
careful. It's a chain.

128
00:08:52,767 --> 00:08:54,682
Who's hungry? Yeah?

129
00:08:59,586 --> 00:09:02,371
Looks like they had fun today.

130
00:09:02,396 --> 00:09:04,441
Oh, I think it was
good for everybody.

131
00:09:04,466 --> 00:09:05,902
Yeah.

132
00:09:05,953 --> 00:09:07,651
How are you feeling?

133
00:09:07,676 --> 00:09:08,895
Also good.

134
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,227
Excuse me. Mm.

135
00:09:14,033 --> 00:09:15,644
How was your
doctor's appointment?

136
00:09:15,669 --> 00:09:18,629
Fine. No changes.

137
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:21,220
Have you heard from
Maggie or Lydia?

138
00:09:21,245 --> 00:09:23,029
I'm sure they're okay.

139
00:09:23,115 --> 00:09:24,364
Are you?

140
00:09:24,505 --> 00:09:26,732
On a beautiful day like today?

141
00:09:27,202 --> 00:09:28,726
Never better.

142
00:09:44,363 --> 00:09:46,525
Oh, gosh. I'm so sorry!

143
00:09:46,578 --> 00:09:48,928
I'm... I'm such a klutz!

144
00:10:20,859 --> 00:10:22,068
Carol?

145
00:10:24,404 --> 00:10:25,971
What are you doing here?

146
00:10:27,372 --> 00:10:28,810
Sorry.

147
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,536
Snooping.

148
00:10:31,909 --> 00:10:34,259
I was worried about Ezekiel.

149
00:10:40,576 --> 00:10:42,270
What do you want to know?

150
00:10:42,763 --> 00:10:46,614
Well, I know that
he needs surgery,

151
00:10:47,621 --> 00:10:49,666
and I know that he's in line.

152
00:10:51,492 --> 00:10:54,349
How long before you
get to number 147?

153
00:11:02,753 --> 00:11:03,919
Too long.

154
00:11:06,013 --> 00:11:08,704
Patients aren't aware
of their place in line,

155
00:11:08,729 --> 00:11:11,427
so can you do me a favor
and keep that yourself?

156
00:11:11,452 --> 00:11:13,583
Mm-hmm. Of course.

157
00:11:14,605 --> 00:11:17,411
Does Ezekiel know how
bad his chances are?

158
00:11:19,907 --> 00:11:23,435
He knows the odds aren't good.

159
00:11:24,082 --> 00:11:25,588
But he doesn't know

160
00:11:25,613 --> 00:11:27,879
there's likely no chance
he'll get the surgery unless...

161
00:11:27,904 --> 00:11:30,561
 by some miracle
he moves up the line.

162
00:11:31,896 --> 00:11:34,508
I'm sorry. I wish
I could do more.

163
00:11:40,871 --> 00:11:42,793
Welcome to the kill house.

164
00:11:42,818 --> 00:11:46,058
In this exercise, killing
is not your primary goal.

165
00:11:46,486 --> 00:11:48,480
I'm looking for
speed and teamwork.

166
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:51,651
Two teams of two will start
the course simultaneously.

167
00:11:52,028 --> 00:11:54,363
One team goes through
the house on the right,

168
00:11:54,903 --> 00:11:57,324
the other team takes
the house on the left.

169
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:01,979
There's one weapon per
team that must be shared.

170
00:12:02,836 --> 00:12:05,360
Your objective...
Get through the house

171
00:12:05,385 --> 00:12:07,692
and all the rotters inside.

172
00:12:07,717 --> 00:12:10,894
There will be a rotter marked
in red at the end of each house.

173
00:12:11,069 --> 00:12:13,254
First team to take out their...

174
00:12:13,278 --> 00:12:15,700
Red gets one step closer
to earning their stripes.

175
00:12:16,057 --> 00:12:18,175
But fail to work as a unit...

176
00:12:19,184 --> 00:12:20,550
see what you get.

177
00:12:21,896 --> 00:12:24,253
Hart, you're with Thomas.

178
00:12:24,814 --> 00:12:26,816
Espinosa, Green.

179
00:12:26,841 --> 00:12:28,973
Quintana, Johnson.

180
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,739
Dixon, Daniels.

181
00:12:30,764 --> 00:12:32,113
Team up.

182
00:12:41,513 --> 00:12:44,864
You mind if I go with
Espinosa? We make a good team.

183
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:46,637
Did I ask for your opinion?

184
00:12:47,752 --> 00:12:49,660
Espinosa, Green.

185
00:12:50,181 --> 00:12:52,629
Dixon, Daniels.

186
00:12:52,881 --> 00:12:54,391
You're up first.

187
00:12:55,394 --> 00:12:57,018
We got this. I know
you're the fastest,

188
00:12:57,043 --> 00:12:58,740
and I'm the baddest,
so we're good.

189
00:12:58,765 --> 00:13:00,183
Let's do this.

190
00:13:00,764 --> 00:13:02,679
Hey. I'm Jake.

191
00:13:03,715 --> 00:13:05,472
'Sup, Jake?

192
00:13:31,643 --> 00:13:32,862
Aah!

193
00:13:33,383 --> 00:13:34,526
I got it!

194
00:13:46,686 --> 00:13:47,859
Clear.

195
00:13:53,911 --> 00:13:55,062
Move.

196
00:13:58,698 --> 00:13:59,712
Take it!

197
00:13:59,904 --> 00:14:01,002
Keep going!

198
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:18,940
Aah!

199
00:14:39,065 --> 00:14:40,568
Espinosa!

200
00:15:10,962 --> 00:15:12,014
Dixon!

201
00:15:12,937 --> 00:15:14,076
Dixon!

202
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:25,208
And what was that?

203
00:15:25,233 --> 00:15:27,105
He was good. I
was right there.

204
00:15:30,427 --> 00:15:33,707
I said speed and teamwork.

205
00:15:35,182 --> 00:15:37,480
Green, Espinosa. Nicely done.

206
00:15:38,492 --> 00:15:39,746
Dixon.

207
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:42,551
You're with me.

208
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,044
Wow.

209
00:15:58,769 --> 00:16:01,567
You have to get
this. It's so good.

210
00:16:02,288 --> 00:16:03,812
I don't have any money.

211
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:06,622
Oh. Don't you
get an allowance?

212
00:16:08,712 --> 00:16:11,324
Hey! Who's your friend, Jude?

213
00:16:11,349 --> 00:16:13,351
Hi, Princess! This is Mei.

214
00:16:13,376 --> 00:16:17,152
Oh, I see Mei got the
memo. I dig her already.

215
00:16:17,497 --> 00:16:18,707
You guys need any help?

216
00:16:18,776 --> 00:16:21,561
Um, I think I'm
ready to check out.

217
00:16:25,238 --> 00:16:28,020
Oh, rock on. Good taste.

218
00:16:28,222 --> 00:16:32,843
Well, pleasure doing business,
and come back anytime, ladies.

219
00:16:38,605 --> 00:16:40,020
You didn't have to.

220
00:16:40,197 --> 00:16:42,551
It's a gift. For a friend

221
00:16:43,563 --> 00:16:45,260
Can I have the receipt?

222
00:16:45,358 --> 00:16:47,142
Oh, don't worry
about paying me back.

223
00:16:47,167 --> 00:16:50,811
I'd like it as a
reminder. Of a good day.

224
00:16:52,395 --> 00:16:54,005
None of these are going to work.

225
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:55,955
Seriously? None of these.

226
00:16:56,007 --> 00:16:59,010
This is ridiculous.

227
00:16:59,054 --> 00:17:01,708
I'm not angry, I'm
just frustrated.

228
00:17:01,733 --> 00:17:03,735
She wants something worthy
of tonight's guests.

229
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,153
That isn't it.

230
00:17:05,178 --> 00:17:07,354
We did the best we could
with the time we had.

231
00:17:07,379 --> 00:17:08,989
She knows you'll come through.

232
00:18:37,585 --> 00:18:38,978
Aah!

233
00:19:09,877 --> 00:19:10,944
Hi.

234
00:19:13,158 --> 00:19:15,725
Espinosa, we don't
need you for this.

235
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,099
I volunteered.

236
00:19:17,124 --> 00:19:20,257
Give her a bag. I
love volunteers.

237
00:19:20,282 --> 00:19:22,326
Especially ones
that look like that.

238
00:19:22,724 --> 00:19:23,756
Right here.

239
00:19:32,622 --> 00:19:35,580
Alright. Let's see
what Santa brought me.

240
00:19:39,819 --> 00:19:41,316
This supposed to be funny?

241
00:19:41,341 --> 00:19:43,474
He gets the newest
ones for his drills.

242
00:19:43,499 --> 00:19:47,242
Advanced military
training, Mercer.

243
00:19:49,005 --> 00:19:51,137
Advanced military training.

244
00:19:51,162 --> 00:19:52,490
It's fine.

245
00:19:56,074 --> 00:19:57,700
Hey, careful with that one.

246
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:00,986
This toothpick?

247
00:20:03,193 --> 00:20:05,805
Yeah. It's not worth my time.

248
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:24,058
You gotta swing all
the way through.

249
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:27,424
That thing is pathetic.
Belongs on a wall.

250
00:20:28,522 --> 00:20:31,090
Alright. Release the rotters.

251
00:20:31,115 --> 00:20:32,303
With me.

252
00:20:39,524 --> 00:20:41,961
Two at a time, on my count.

253
00:20:41,986 --> 00:20:44,031
Three, two, one.

254
00:21:30,056 --> 00:21:32,870
Why did you do that?! You...

255
00:21:33,782 --> 00:21:35,305
Are you serious?

256
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:37,987
Thisis the future soldier
of the Commonwealth?

257
00:22:00,217 --> 00:22:03,291
You shouldn't have intervened.
He would've been fine.

258
00:22:04,376 --> 00:22:07,205
Did I fail another
team-building exercise?

259
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:11,500
You're used to handling things
on your own. I get that.

260
00:22:11,525 --> 00:22:13,353
But that's not how
it works around here.

261
00:22:13,518 --> 00:22:16,103
Sometimes we have to set
each other up to win.

262
00:22:16,854 --> 00:22:19,987
What does that have to do
with that little prick's ego?

263
00:22:20,235 --> 00:22:21,509
This place...

264
00:22:22,243 --> 00:22:24,243
 is as good
as anything I've seen.

265
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:26,830
It'll give you a decent
life if you can cut it.

266
00:22:27,104 --> 00:22:29,095
And I want you to succeed.

267
00:22:30,128 --> 00:22:32,227
But you gotta get out
of your own damn way.

268
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:48,157
You get lost out there?

269
00:22:50,131 --> 00:22:53,026
Sorry. Long line
at the kitchen.

270
00:22:54,653 --> 00:22:56,307
Here you go.

271
00:23:02,514 --> 00:23:04,011
How was your day?

272
00:23:04,047 --> 00:23:06,266
What? How was your day?

273
00:23:06,291 --> 00:23:07,944
It was great.

274
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:10,603
I made a new friend. Oh, yeah?

275
00:23:10,912 --> 00:23:12,487
She got me a record.

276
00:23:13,194 --> 00:23:14,847
You ever heard of Motorhead?

277
00:23:15,157 --> 00:23:16,534
That's good stuff.

278
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:17,777
Here, boy.

279
00:23:20,338 --> 00:23:21,513
Oh. Hi!

280
00:23:21,538 --> 00:23:23,670
Daryl? Yeah?

281
00:23:23,695 --> 00:23:25,610
Can I get an allowance?

282
00:23:27,982 --> 00:23:30,377
Can we wait a little
while 'til my job settles?

283
00:23:30,855 --> 00:23:32,657
Then we'll talk about it again?

284
00:23:33,217 --> 00:23:34,653
So, we can stay?

285
00:23:34,771 --> 00:23:36,594
Do you want to stay?

286
00:23:36,888 --> 00:23:39,021
Even after Alexandria
is all cleaned up?

287
00:23:39,046 --> 00:23:41,299
I do! Yeah?

288
00:23:43,778 --> 00:23:44,877
It's nice.

289
00:23:45,567 --> 00:23:47,791
I think as long as my mom knows

290
00:23:47,816 --> 00:23:50,814
where to find us,
I want to stay.

291
00:23:55,642 --> 00:23:58,620
Yeah, no. It's way too tight.

292
00:24:01,296 --> 00:24:03,228
Tell Max we'll have
something by tonight.

293
00:24:28,362 --> 00:24:29,728
How did you know?

294
00:24:30,524 --> 00:24:32,986
My mother always taught
me to be observant.

295
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:37,197
So, you found a way to get
outside the walls, huh?

296
00:24:37,956 --> 00:24:39,128
Mm...

297
00:24:42,337 --> 00:24:43,737
What do you want from me?

298
00:24:45,084 --> 00:24:47,609
I have a friend who's
waiting for surgery,

299
00:24:47,634 --> 00:24:50,027
and I need you to get him
to the front of the line.

300
00:24:50,509 --> 00:24:52,316
That's a big ask.

301
00:24:53,124 --> 00:24:54,272
Difficult stuff.

302
00:24:54,629 --> 00:24:56,065
Not for you.

303
00:24:58,604 --> 00:25:00,042
First things first.

304
00:25:00,547 --> 00:25:02,766
I need to make sure this
wine goes over well.

305
00:25:02,791 --> 00:25:04,175
Oh, it will.

306
00:25:09,473 --> 00:25:12,433
Mmm! I can almost taste it.

307
00:25:12,892 --> 00:25:15,541
Shame, my kids don't
even know what mango is.

308
00:25:15,566 --> 00:25:18,133
Well, maybe they'll
have some one day.

309
00:25:18,909 --> 00:25:20,140
My kids?

310
00:25:22,205 --> 00:25:24,119
Not anytime soon.

311
00:25:43,002 --> 00:25:44,308
Thank you.

312
00:25:52,803 --> 00:25:54,293
Want some wine?

313
00:25:54,584 --> 00:25:56,666
We hear it's really good.

314
00:25:57,137 --> 00:25:58,747
Thank you.

315
00:25:59,665 --> 00:26:00,710
Cheers.

316
00:26:06,656 --> 00:26:07,901
What's wrong?

317
00:26:10,013 --> 00:26:11,644
Not really my scene.

318
00:26:12,231 --> 00:26:15,238
You know, I was cool being
on the other side of this.

319
00:26:15,809 --> 00:26:18,942
But this... This is
your world, not mine.

320
00:26:20,471 --> 00:26:23,286
Okay. Just take it easy.

321
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,228
If this is how the
other half lives,

322
00:26:25,253 --> 00:26:27,356
might as well enjoy it, right?

323
00:26:27,503 --> 00:26:29,455
Mm. Thank you.

324
00:26:38,197 --> 00:26:39,610
On your left! On your left!

325
00:26:39,634 --> 00:26:42,941
- Shot over here!
- This way!

326
00:26:48,046 --> 00:26:50,483
- Good to see you, sir!
- Enjoy the party.

327
00:26:50,508 --> 00:26:51,987
- Enjoy the party.
- Quick photo?

328
00:26:52,674 --> 00:26:55,938
One more look. This way, sir.

329
00:26:56,389 --> 00:26:58,852
Wow. He hates you.

330
00:26:58,877 --> 00:27:00,063
That was a hate smile.

331
00:27:18,629 --> 00:27:21,813
Hey, Mercer! Echate pa ca!

332
00:27:22,796 --> 00:27:24,360
Gonna need a translation.

333
00:27:24,385 --> 00:27:26,822
I just wanted to say hi.

334
00:27:26,847 --> 00:27:30,479
You look very handsome
tonight. Súper guapo.

335
00:27:32,035 --> 00:27:33,222
It's not my thing.

336
00:27:33,247 --> 00:27:35,641
Oh, it is. Trust me.

337
00:27:36,774 --> 00:27:38,229
You know, uh...

338
00:27:39,006 --> 00:27:41,269
I hate these big events.

339
00:27:41,577 --> 00:27:43,196
Kinda boring.

340
00:27:44,071 --> 00:27:45,883
You want to make it
more interesting?

341
00:27:45,934 --> 00:27:47,055
Join me?

342
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:49,971
I would be honored.

343
00:28:00,154 --> 00:28:01,329
Name?

344
00:28:01,354 --> 00:28:02,703
She's with me.

345
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,407
There's a dress code.

346
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:29,375
Princess!

347
00:28:36,074 --> 00:28:37,096
Pamela,

348
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:39,284
how do you like the wine?

349
00:28:39,309 --> 00:28:40,511
It's fine.

350
00:28:42,485 --> 00:28:45,305
If you'll excuse me, Lance,
I'm due for an interview.

351
00:28:46,829 --> 00:28:49,869
Oh, and we need to get
a meeting on the books

352
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:51,579
about this Alexandria thing.

353
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:53,760
I have questions.
I have a pitch.

354
00:28:53,785 --> 00:28:55,579
I'm sure you do.

355
00:28:59,006 --> 00:29:01,715
Connie, so lovely
to see you again.

356
00:29:02,484 --> 00:29:04,589
Kelly, nice to meet you.

357
00:29:04,812 --> 00:29:06,941
I hope you're enjoying
the festivities.

358
00:29:11,246 --> 00:29:13,261
"Such an eventful day.

359
00:29:14,468 --> 00:29:16,566
But speaking on the record,

360
00:29:17,259 --> 00:29:20,830
do you celebrate every holiday
with such grandeur here?"

361
00:29:21,421 --> 00:29:24,903
Traditions provide comfort and
structure in uncertain times.

362
00:29:24,928 --> 00:29:28,636
So, yes, we treasure
our holidays here.

363
00:29:28,835 --> 00:29:31,011
But Halloween is extra special.

364
00:29:31,392 --> 00:29:34,525
You may remember from my
father's time in the White House

365
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:35,946
that it was his favorite.

366
00:29:36,223 --> 00:29:38,356
He always loved a
good masquerade ball.

367
00:29:44,003 --> 00:29:47,618
"What would your father
say about the class divide

368
00:29:47,867 --> 00:29:49,245
on display here?"

369
00:29:49,894 --> 00:29:52,680
Well, we're lucky
you've found us.

370
00:29:52,705 --> 00:29:55,847
We appreciate and celebrate
every single person

371
00:29:55,872 --> 00:29:58,254
who contributes to
our vibrant community.

372
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:01,540
In fact, I want to
introduce you to someone.

373
00:30:06,663 --> 00:30:08,910
Carrie is last year's
lottery winner.

374
00:30:08,935 --> 00:30:10,937
This is her first
masquerade ball!

375
00:30:11,789 --> 00:30:13,212
If you'll excuse me.

376
00:30:17,025 --> 00:30:19,244
Excuse me, Pamela, I'm...
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

377
00:30:19,288 --> 00:30:21,581
Ms. Milton has a very
strict itinerary tonight.

378
00:30:31,548 --> 00:30:33,028
That guy looks so familiar.

379
00:30:33,053 --> 00:30:35,636
Yeah, I kicked his
ass in the train car.

380
00:30:35,703 --> 00:30:37,534
That Trooper? Uh-huh.

381
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,627
Why is he serving food?

382
00:30:41,675 --> 00:30:43,330
Testing, testing.

383
00:30:43,355 --> 00:30:45,597
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention

384
00:30:45,622 --> 00:30:47,073
for a moment, please?

385
00:30:47,413 --> 00:30:49,989
It is my honor tonight
to introduce someone

386
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:52,103
who needs no introduction.

387
00:30:52,128 --> 00:30:53,607
Our esteemed leader,

388
00:30:53,632 --> 00:30:55,590
the governor of
the Commonwealth,

389
00:30:55,615 --> 00:30:57,042
Ms. Pamela Milton!

390
00:31:07,159 --> 00:31:09,858
Thank you all for
coming out this evening.

391
00:31:09,939 --> 00:31:12,649
Tonight, I have
the great pleasure

392
00:31:12,674 --> 00:31:16,287
of giving you a sneak peek
at something truly special.

393
00:31:21,996 --> 00:31:25,231
This is the work of the
brilliant Alexa Park,

394
00:31:25,256 --> 00:31:26,969
who is here tonight.

395
00:31:26,994 --> 00:31:28,941
Don't be shy, Alexa.

396
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:32,013
It took Ms. Park nine months

397
00:31:32,038 --> 00:31:34,266
to lovingly create
this painting.

398
00:31:34,291 --> 00:31:35,989
Like many of our citizens,

399
00:31:36,032 --> 00:31:38,647
she sustained serious
injuries out in the world

400
00:31:38,672 --> 00:31:41,448
before she found sanctuary
at the Commonwealth.

401
00:31:41,473 --> 00:31:43,911
Thanks to my
father's sacrifices,

402
00:31:43,936 --> 00:31:45,215
we are all here.

403
00:31:45,536 --> 00:31:48,669
Brick by brick and
block by block,

404
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:51,191
we're putting the
world back together

405
00:31:51,216 --> 00:31:52,696
the way it was.

406
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:56,403
My father would be so proud

407
00:31:56,428 --> 00:31:58,504
to see what the
Commonwealth is today.

408
00:31:58,856 --> 00:32:02,991
How much this place protects
and cares for all its citizens.

409
00:32:03,016 --> 00:32:04,285
Bullshit!

410
00:32:04,903 --> 00:32:06,369
This is bullshit!

411
00:32:06,966 --> 00:32:09,206
Sir, that's enough... Does
anyone here really believe

412
00:32:09,231 --> 00:32:11,973
the Commonwealth cares
for all its citizens?

413
00:32:13,345 --> 00:32:15,086
Do you know who I am?

414
00:32:15,182 --> 00:32:17,097
Sir, this isn't the time.

415
00:32:17,122 --> 00:32:18,589
Please, you need to stop.

416
00:32:19,147 --> 00:32:20,597
Don't come any closer!

417
00:32:20,622 --> 00:32:23,269
Don't come any closer!
I just want to talk.

418
00:32:23,299 --> 00:32:25,078
Will you please
just talk to me?!

419
00:32:25,103 --> 00:32:27,845
I would've died for this
place. What's my name?!

420
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:29,697
I don't know. But I'd like to.

421
00:32:29,722 --> 00:32:32,116
Tyler Davis. I was a Trooper.

422
00:32:32,141 --> 00:32:34,445
I tried and I
tried to reach you.

423
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:36,519
One mistake and I
lost everything.

424
00:32:38,179 --> 00:32:41,066
I came here to talk to
you, to make you listen.

425
00:32:41,107 --> 00:32:43,066
Tyler. I want to listen.

426
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:44,638
Let's talk, just
the two of us...

427
00:32:44,663 --> 00:32:45,832
Don't lie!

428
00:32:45,857 --> 00:32:47,308
Thisis what you care about.

429
00:32:49,649 --> 00:32:51,869
Fancy parties and paintings.

430
00:32:54,951 --> 00:32:56,709
Not people like me.

431
00:32:57,794 --> 00:33:00,710
We're nothing to
you. Disposable.

432
00:33:00,735 --> 00:33:02,640
You're wrong, Tyler.

433
00:33:02,854 --> 00:33:03,971
I see you.

434
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:07,017
I see you're hurting
and I want to fix that.

435
00:33:07,042 --> 00:33:09,958
But first, you have to promise
not to hurt anyone else.

436
00:33:10,075 --> 00:33:13,992
Please put down the knife
and let my assistant go.

437
00:33:15,548 --> 00:33:17,335
Her name is Max.

438
00:33:20,912 --> 00:33:22,363
I'm like you.

439
00:33:23,211 --> 00:33:24,817
I'm like you.

440
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:27,074
I'm sorry.

441
00:33:27,794 --> 00:33:29,074
I'm so sorry.

442
00:33:39,814 --> 00:33:41,030
Did get hurt you?

443
00:33:41,055 --> 00:33:43,721
I'm okay. I'm okay.

444
00:33:44,241 --> 00:33:46,032
Just gonna stand there?

445
00:33:46,836 --> 00:33:48,881
Go after him!

446
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:54,639
Get him.

447
00:33:58,473 --> 00:34:00,813
South wing and roof, all clear.

448
00:34:00,838 --> 00:34:02,361
I need a status on Dixon.

449
00:34:53,181 --> 00:34:54,770
Got nowhere to go.

450
00:34:56,617 --> 00:34:57,792
You taking me in?

451
00:34:58,066 --> 00:34:59,458
You gonna give me a choice?

452
00:35:06,052 --> 00:35:07,854
Shit, I didn't mean to...

453
00:35:09,001 --> 00:35:10,978
I just wanted to talk to her,

454
00:35:11,624 --> 00:35:13,274
to get her to understand.

455
00:35:15,534 --> 00:35:17,455
But that was never gonna happen.

456
00:35:19,099 --> 00:35:20,230
Stop!

457
00:35:20,282 --> 00:35:21,497
Don't do that.

458
00:35:23,296 --> 00:35:26,082
I screwed up protocols
with a prisoner.

459
00:35:26,107 --> 00:35:27,114
I got beat up.

460
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:30,270
Lost my apartment,
my spending card...

461
00:35:30,295 --> 00:35:32,684
I have no way to help
my sister or kids.

462
00:35:33,064 --> 00:35:34,519
You got a sister.

463
00:35:34,989 --> 00:35:36,869
That means you got family.

464
00:35:37,274 --> 00:35:39,776
A lot of us don't get
to have that anymore.

465
00:35:40,987 --> 00:35:44,599
Don't take that away
from her. It's not fair.

466
00:35:56,603 --> 00:35:57,833
Turn around.

467
00:36:05,888 --> 00:36:07,041
Let's go.

468
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:15,689
You caught the bastard.

469
00:36:17,978 --> 00:36:19,979
Finally did something right.

470
00:36:22,023 --> 00:36:23,023
No.

471
00:36:23,435 --> 00:36:24,838
No, you caught him.

472
00:36:25,829 --> 00:36:28,196
Go ahead. Take
him to your mom.

473
00:36:46,944 --> 00:36:48,989
He could have grabbed anyone.

474
00:37:13,479 --> 00:37:14,958
Well done, Sebastian.

475
00:37:21,383 --> 00:37:22,622
Remove him.

476
00:37:22,813 --> 00:37:25,083
You think getting rid
of me solves anything?

477
00:37:25,413 --> 00:37:27,415
There are thousands
more like me.

478
00:37:27,496 --> 00:37:29,629
Resist the Commonwealth!

479
00:37:29,677 --> 00:37:31,418
Visibility for workers!

480
00:37:31,568 --> 00:37:33,380
Equality for all!

481
00:37:37,574 --> 00:37:39,271
Are there thousands more?

482
00:37:39,296 --> 00:37:40,511
No.

483
00:37:44,324 --> 00:37:45,977
Make sure.

484
00:38:13,922 --> 00:38:16,185
Inside, please,
miss. Let's go.

485
00:38:33,008 --> 00:38:34,370
How'd the wine go over?

486
00:38:34,998 --> 00:38:36,072
Great.

487
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:37,990
It was a good first step.

488
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,214
What's next?

489
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:42,695
I'm glad you asked.

490
00:38:43,803 --> 00:38:45,805
Murphy, you're on the door.

491
00:38:45,987 --> 00:38:48,203
Katz, Lewis, split
the wait staff.

492
00:38:48,319 --> 00:38:50,321
Figure out how he gained access.

493
00:38:50,346 --> 00:38:52,585
Did he have help?
I want answers.

494
00:38:53,577 --> 00:38:54,838
Espinosa.

495
00:38:56,351 --> 00:38:58,092
Your friend on the wait staff.

496
00:38:58,117 --> 00:38:59,698
Yeah. See if she
knows anything.

497
00:38:59,723 --> 00:39:00,854
Yes, sir.

498
00:39:04,332 --> 00:39:06,464
So, did you work with him long?

499
00:39:06,489 --> 00:39:08,179
No, we never even met.

500
00:39:08,472 --> 00:39:10,628
Oh, really? It's such
a small crew here.

501
00:39:12,296 --> 00:39:13,671
You think I'm lying?

502
00:39:14,058 --> 00:39:16,147
I'm just trying to
figure out what happened.

503
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:18,241
I think it's pretty clear.

504
00:39:18,754 --> 00:39:20,210
Didn't you hear what he said?

505
00:39:20,857 --> 00:39:22,641
Yeah, that there were others.

506
00:39:22,831 --> 00:39:24,398
What do you think
he meant by that?

507
00:39:24,525 --> 00:39:26,002
No idea.

508
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,417
But for what it's
worth, I believe him.

509
00:39:30,038 --> 00:39:32,437
This place is like
a city from before.

510
00:39:37,068 --> 00:39:38,362
You remember.

511
00:39:39,586 --> 00:39:41,066
Yeah, I do.

512
00:39:44,914 --> 00:39:47,613
But you're doing this.

513
00:39:54,061 --> 00:39:55,758
So, you don't know
how he got in?

514
00:39:55,783 --> 00:39:56,783
Nope.

515
00:39:57,330 --> 00:39:58,361
Great.

516
00:40:03,955 --> 00:40:06,077
I wasn't expecting you.

517
00:40:06,552 --> 00:40:08,390
Well, it's nice to see you, too.

518
00:40:08,683 --> 00:40:09,734
Come in.

519
00:40:10,834 --> 00:40:11,976
Thanks.

520
00:40:18,673 --> 00:40:19,696
Oh!

521
00:40:22,673 --> 00:40:23,878
Vintage?

522
00:40:24,379 --> 00:40:27,636
Yes. I am a lady
of high caliber.

523
00:40:29,688 --> 00:40:31,047
The highest.

524
00:40:36,266 --> 00:40:37,767
Wasn't that something today?

525
00:40:38,097 --> 00:40:39,097
Oh.

526
00:40:40,535 --> 00:40:43,405
They really know how to throw a
party around here, don't they?

527
00:40:43,516 --> 00:40:44,996
Kids had a blast.

528
00:40:48,164 --> 00:40:49,260
Yeah.

529
00:40:49,555 --> 00:40:50,963
He would've loved it.

530
00:40:55,061 --> 00:40:56,116
Yeah.

531
00:41:01,135 --> 00:41:05,182
I know that this was too
painful before, but...

532
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,659
This belongs to you.

533
00:41:23,637 --> 00:41:26,335
You should keep it. No, no, no.

534
00:41:29,234 --> 00:41:30,830
I want you to have it.

535
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:43,549
This place can be a fresh start.

536
00:41:45,148 --> 00:41:46,885
If you want it to be.

537
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:52,791
How are you? Really?

538
00:41:54,515 --> 00:41:55,737
Just great.

539
00:41:57,385 --> 00:41:59,561
Still finding reasons to smile.

540
00:42:05,621 --> 00:42:07,362
Well, then...

541
00:42:16,713 --> 00:42:18,460
To fresh starts.

542
00:42:24,241 --> 00:42:25,334
Mm.

543
00:42:28,134 --> 00:42:30,734
It's not bad. It's
not bad at all.

544
00:42:34,516 --> 00:42:37,127
You always took the
big glass. Mm-hmm.

545
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:42,635
DAY 33 IN THE COMMONWEALTH

546
00:42:51,983 --> 00:42:53,396
You look awesome.

547
00:42:54,401 --> 00:42:55,452
Thanks.

548
00:42:57,110 --> 00:42:58,726
And you look official.

549
00:42:59,851 --> 00:43:02,156
Yeah? You think so?

550
00:43:05,233 --> 00:43:06,375
Hm.

551
00:43:07,245 --> 00:43:08,905
I don't feel official.

552
00:43:09,902 --> 00:43:11,600
Hey, I got you something.

553
00:43:17,241 --> 00:43:18,509
Yes!

554
00:44:00,351 --> 00:44:01,413
Clear!

555
00:44:54,815 --> 00:44:56,642
Please open the door.

556
00:44:56,667 --> 00:44:58,262
She's not there.

557
00:44:59,471 --> 00:45:02,300
You think she was kidnapped by
the government or something?

558
00:45:02,344 --> 00:45:05,216
Her only hope is for me
to expose them myself.

559
00:45:05,241 --> 00:45:07,243
Governor Milton runs the city.

560
00:45:07,268 --> 00:45:08,661
But I know how it runs.

561
00:45:08,686 --> 00:45:10,511
You want to make a true
believer out of me?

562
00:45:10,669 --> 00:45:12,018
I want you to be a part of it.

563
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:15,078
Something happened.

564
00:45:16,126 --> 00:45:18,955
And they clearly have a reason
for suppressing the truth.

565
00:45:30,546 --> 00:45:32,200
Come on, man, that's enough.

566
00:45:32,243 --> 00:45:33,984
Hey, man. No problem, man.

567
00:45:34,028 --> 00:45:37,727
In the teaser of this episode

568
00:45:37,771 --> 00:45:40,643
we wanted this feel of,
like, it's a little surreal

569
00:45:40,686 --> 00:45:43,472
for our people to... to
be at the Commonwealth,

570
00:45:43,515 --> 00:45:46,518
for Daryl, he does not feel
at ease at a place like this,

571
00:45:46,562 --> 00:45:49,913
because it just feels so fake,
and so I think the idea of

572
00:45:49,957 --> 00:45:52,481
this, like, haunted
mansion where, you know,

573
00:45:52,524 --> 00:45:54,700
the maze that they're
going through...

574
00:45:56,311 --> 00:45:58,356
is like, wow, we've
just made zombies

575
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,141
kind of almost like a joke,

576
00:46:00,184 --> 00:46:02,534
but it tells you that the
place is, like, really safe,

577
00:46:02,578 --> 00:46:05,233
that they're not even,
like, afraid to have zombies

578
00:46:05,276 --> 00:46:06,930
as part of an entertainment now.

579
00:46:06,974 --> 00:46:10,412
And we wanted to show, like,
when they go out into this

580
00:46:10,455 --> 00:46:13,894
festival, it's as much like
the old world during a holiday

581
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:15,765
as, like, they've ever had.

582
00:46:15,809 --> 00:46:18,550
They treat things very,
very differently here,

583
00:46:18,594 --> 00:46:21,684
and it is even more
unsettling than Alexandria was

584
00:46:21,727 --> 00:46:24,034
for our people when
they first came in.

585
00:46:24,078 --> 00:46:26,515
So, uh, what do you think?

586
00:46:26,558 --> 00:46:29,910
Takes a minute to get used
to all this, you know?

587
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:32,173
Maybe we don't have to do
anything to make it work.

588
00:46:32,216 --> 00:46:36,568
Nah, there's always somethin'
you gotta do to make it work.

589
00:46:36,612 --> 00:46:39,354
The idea of two
people and one knife

590
00:46:39,397 --> 00:46:43,619
came out of the writer's
room, 'cause we were tryin' to

591
00:46:43,662 --> 00:46:47,884
come up with a challenge that
shows true partnership...

592
00:46:47,928 --> 00:46:49,755
You have to be in sync.

593
00:46:49,799 --> 00:46:53,368
And I think Rosita and her
partner actually pretty

594
00:46:53,411 --> 00:46:56,893
seamlessly figure out like,
let's talk to each other.

595
00:46:56,937 --> 00:46:58,721
- I got it!
- Let's take turns with

596
00:46:58,764 --> 00:47:00,592
the knife, like, one
person's gonna cover

597
00:47:00,636 --> 00:47:02,943
while the other person's
got the weapon, like,

598
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:04,596
we're gonna move
sort of as a unit.

599
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:06,294
They basically pass the test.

600
00:47:06,337 --> 00:47:08,209
Green, Espinosa, nicely done.

601
00:47:08,252 --> 00:47:11,647
Daryl is very, very good at
working with his friends,

602
00:47:11,690 --> 00:47:15,564
but his partner is a little
bit weaker than he is, like,

603
00:47:15,607 --> 00:47:17,392
terms of, like, skill set.

604
00:47:17,435 --> 00:47:20,177
And so I think, like, Daryl
wasn't expecting that,

605
00:47:20,221 --> 00:47:23,659
so when he's like, "You take
the knife, I'm just gonna, like,

606
00:47:23,702 --> 00:47:27,184
do my thing here," he's used to
working with people that you can

607
00:47:27,228 --> 00:47:30,405
give the knife and that's an
act of generosity, you know?

608
00:47:30,448 --> 00:47:32,549
And, like, they're gonna do
their thing, and he's gonna do

609
00:47:32,573 --> 00:47:34,365
his thing, and that's
gonna work out great.

610
00:47:34,409 --> 00:47:36,237
Dixon!

611
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:38,979
When Mercer comes in and
he shoots the walker,

612
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:42,199
Daryl, like, honestly is very
surprised, 'cause he's kinda

613
00:47:42,243 --> 00:47:45,463
like, "I was literally right
there," like, "I wasn't gonna

614
00:47:45,507 --> 00:47:46,943
let that guy die."

615
00:47:46,987 --> 00:47:49,076
But in Mercer's eyes, he's like,

616
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:52,470
"You have failed the
spirit of this exercise."

617
00:47:52,514 --> 00:47:55,430
What I see is a guy that
doesn't know how to work with

618
00:47:55,473 --> 00:47:58,650
his partner and he just goes
lone wolf and does his own thing

619
00:47:58,694 --> 00:48:01,827
and doesn't communicate, so
I don't think either of them

620
00:48:01,871 --> 00:48:04,656
are really wrong, but they
don't see eye to eye yet.

621
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:07,181
You're used to handling things
on your own, I get that.

622
00:48:07,224 --> 00:48:09,226
But that's not how
it works around here.

623
00:48:09,270 --> 00:48:13,013
Sometimes we gotta set
each other up to win.

624
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:16,712
This is the first time,
at the masquerade ball,

625
00:48:16,755 --> 00:48:19,062
where you very clearly see that

626
00:48:19,106 --> 00:48:21,891
only a certain
segment of society

627
00:48:21,935 --> 00:48:23,719
is welcome to this event.

628
00:48:23,762 --> 00:48:27,114
The celebration at the beginning
of the day was for everybody,

629
00:48:27,157 --> 00:48:30,204
and now this is the special
celebration for the people

630
00:48:30,247 --> 00:48:32,728
who are privileged
enough to be invited.

631
00:48:32,771 --> 00:48:35,252
There's something odd for
our people like Magna,

632
00:48:35,296 --> 00:48:37,559
who's working at the
party, to go like,

633
00:48:37,602 --> 00:48:40,431
"Wow, all that old stuff that
we thought we left behind,

634
00:48:40,475 --> 00:48:42,607
that we thought
didn't matter anymore,

635
00:48:42,651 --> 00:48:44,479
actually has always
mattered here,"

636
00:48:44,522 --> 00:48:47,656
and it's jarring for Magna,
who we had previously, like,

637
00:48:47,699 --> 00:48:50,485
established, like, when we
introduced her, she said that

638
00:48:50,528 --> 00:48:52,748
she used to be a
waitress, and it's like,

639
00:48:52,791 --> 00:48:55,098
here she is, serving
food, and I think, like,

640
00:48:55,142 --> 00:48:57,187
she never thought
that she would be

641
00:48:57,231 --> 00:48:58,884
knocked back down to that again.

642
00:48:58,928 --> 00:49:00,234
But I think for Princess,

643
00:49:00,277 --> 00:49:02,105
who wants to be
amongst people again,

644
00:49:02,149 --> 00:49:04,716
she's right there, like,
you know, she's right there

645
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:06,588
to, like, see everybody
kinda come in.

646
00:49:08,285 --> 00:49:11,288
I think Lance really
wants to be loved.

647
00:49:11,332 --> 00:49:13,769
He feels like, "Well, I'm really

648
00:49:13,812 --> 00:49:16,424
pulling the strings
of this place,"

649
00:49:16,467 --> 00:49:18,513
like, "this is my doing," right?

650
00:49:18,556 --> 00:49:22,038
And I think, like, he really
wants the recognition!

651
00:49:22,082 --> 00:49:25,476
But we actually talked about
the fact that we think that,

652
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:28,001
in this community,
somebody like Mercer,

653
00:49:28,044 --> 00:49:31,134
who is this super soldier,
and, like, the bright suit

654
00:49:31,178 --> 00:49:34,920
and all of that, he is kind of
a celebrity in the Commonwealth,

655
00:49:34,964 --> 00:49:38,141
and I think for Mercer,
like, truly, truly, truly,

656
00:49:38,185 --> 00:49:40,926
that is an uncomfortable
place to be,

657
00:49:40,970 --> 00:49:44,321
'cause I think he is somebody
who always imagined that he'd

658
00:49:44,365 --> 00:49:47,324
just be a public servant,
but for the Commonwealth,

659
00:49:47,368 --> 00:49:50,327
optics are important to them
and important to Pamela,

660
00:49:50,371 --> 00:49:54,114
and so he's accepted that that's
part of the way his job goes.

661
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:56,725
And first place goes to...

662
00:49:56,768 --> 00:49:59,989
Dressed as our
very own Mercer...

663
00:50:00,033 --> 00:50:01,773
Celeste!

664
00:50:01,817 --> 00:50:05,299
But for Hornsby it's
like, right, the...

665
00:50:05,342 --> 00:50:06,996
He's the popular one.

666
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:09,520
Right, okay.

667
00:50:09,564 --> 00:50:11,174
All: Mercer! Mercer! Mercer!

668
00:50:14,699 --> 00:50:18,051
As we were talking about, um,
this character Tyler Davis,

669
00:50:18,094 --> 00:50:20,183
who we met in the
episode "Splinter"

670
00:50:20,227 --> 00:50:21,967
in the season 10 extension,

671
00:50:22,011 --> 00:50:24,970
we were like, "Well, what's
his experience, like,

672
00:50:25,014 --> 00:50:27,408
after 'Splinter'
happened," and, you know,

673
00:50:27,451 --> 00:50:30,367
he's a very complex
character, because, like,

674
00:50:30,411 --> 00:50:33,805
I don't feel particularly sorry
for him, like, all the time,

675
00:50:33,849 --> 00:50:37,157
'cause I'm like, man, he did
take this person hostage,

676
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,985
he clearly doesn't have
the coping skills, right?

677
00:50:40,029 --> 00:50:42,988
He is an imperfect
messenger, and I think

678
00:50:43,032 --> 00:50:46,079
that's what makes it
easy to discount him.

679
00:50:46,122 --> 00:50:48,124
This is what you care about.

680
00:50:48,168 --> 00:50:51,867
Fancy parties and paintings.

681
00:50:51,910 --> 00:50:55,131
That's one of the things that
we'll start to see that Connie,

682
00:50:55,175 --> 00:50:56,567
for example, is keying in on,

683
00:50:56,611 --> 00:50:59,266
'cause she's got journalist
instincts, you know?

684
00:50:59,309 --> 00:51:02,791
And I think in any society
there's always an underbelly,

685
00:51:02,834 --> 00:51:06,099
there's always, like, people
who are gonna be pushing at...

686
00:51:06,142 --> 00:51:08,449
Against it, for
better or for worse.

687
00:51:08,492 --> 00:51:10,799
You think getting rid
of me solves anything?

688
00:51:10,842 --> 00:51:13,018
There are thousands
more like me.

689
00:51:13,062 --> 00:51:15,020
Resist the Commonwealth!

690
00:51:15,064 --> 00:51:17,066
Visibility for workers!

691
00:51:17,110 --> 00:51:19,242
Equality for all!

692
00:51:19,286 --> 00:51:22,463
But how much of the truth is he
telling... are there thousands

693
00:51:22,506 --> 00:51:24,247
of people that are part of this?

694
00:51:24,291 --> 00:51:27,468
Is this, like, something that
he is imagining is gonna happen?

695
00:51:27,511 --> 00:51:30,166
Like, we wanted to leave
that question hanging.

696
00:51:30,210 --> 00:51:32,037
Are there thousands more?

697
00:51:32,081 --> 00:51:33,996
No.

698
00:51:36,868 --> 00:51:38,435
Make sure.

699
00:51:38,479 --> 00:51:41,438
When Rosita comes into
that little secret room,

700
00:51:41,482 --> 00:51:45,225
then she's kinda seeing the
things that he's been painting,

701
00:51:45,268 --> 00:51:47,923
I think there's a part
of her that's like,

702
00:51:47,966 --> 00:51:51,231
"Huh, maybe there's more
to this than I thought."

703
00:51:51,274 --> 00:51:54,669
I think just a lot of things
are running through her head

704
00:51:54,712 --> 00:51:57,498
at that moment, and it's
something for the audience

705
00:51:57,541 --> 00:52:00,762
to watch, and you can just
see, like, so many different

706
00:52:00,805 --> 00:52:03,895
thoughts, like, flitting across
her eyes, like, Christian,

707
00:52:03,939 --> 00:52:07,203
she does such a great job in
that scene of seeing things

708
00:52:07,247 --> 00:52:09,640
without saying things,
'cause I think, really,

709
00:52:09,684 --> 00:52:12,339
this character feels like
she's at, like, this really odd

710
00:52:12,382 --> 00:52:15,211
crossroads that she never
thought she'd find herself at.

710
00:52:16,305 --> 00:53:16,505
