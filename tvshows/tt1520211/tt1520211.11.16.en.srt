1
00:00:01,147 --> 00:00:03,814
Those monsters are on the loose,
we need to smoke them out.

2
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:05,187
We'll start with the Hilltop.

Previously on "The
Walking Dead"...

00:00:07,968 --> 00:00:10,643
Open up, ain't nobody leavin'
until they look around.

5
00:00:11,221 --> 00:00:13,747
You are gonna get me my cash.

6
00:00:14,292 --> 00:00:18,307
They wanted us to stay quiet
but there are good people here.

7
00:00:18,354 --> 00:00:19,664
They need to know the truth.

8
00:00:19,851 --> 00:00:21,733
You want me to look
for secret files?

9
00:00:21,758 --> 00:00:24,561
Yes, and steal them. This
involves the Miltons?

10
00:00:24,586 --> 00:00:26,414
The young psychopath, at least.

11
00:00:26,674 --> 00:00:30,053
My name is Lance Hornsby and
I'm here to offer you a job.

00:02:02,985 --> 00:02:04,444
You have everything?

16
00:02:04,586 --> 00:02:05,668
Piggy Pig?

17
00:02:05,693 --> 00:02:07,220
I'm not a baby anymore, Mom.

18
00:02:07,354 --> 00:02:08,699
Right. I forgot.

19
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,527
I don't wanna go.

20
00:02:14,847 --> 00:02:16,904
It's only temporary. Okay?

21
00:02:18,142 --> 00:02:19,653
I promise.

22
00:02:21,549 --> 00:02:23,697
I wanna help. I know
you do, Hershel,

23
00:02:23,722 --> 00:02:25,377
but not this time, okay?

24
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,394
How far do you think?

25
00:02:29,419 --> 00:02:31,543
12 miles south, give or take.

26
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:33,637
Should get there before
dark if we move fast.

27
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,465
Then we'll be back
before you know it.

28
00:02:38,314 --> 00:02:39,285
Okay?

29
00:02:52,356 --> 00:02:53,598
I got you.

30
00:03:11,962 --> 00:03:13,154
Call it.

31
00:03:14,031 --> 00:03:15,375
Tails, I guess.

32
00:03:17,483 --> 00:03:18,881
Over there, please.

33
00:03:22,137 --> 00:03:23,965
Gonna give us the
assignment, sir?

34
00:03:26,862 --> 00:03:28,206
You'll know soon enough.

35
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:39,146
Morning. Oh, my God.

36
00:03:41,798 --> 00:03:43,247
I thought you were still asleep.

37
00:03:43,272 --> 00:03:45,529
Well, I was... soundly so.

38
00:03:47,641 --> 00:03:50,177
I thought we had a
lovely night, didn't we?

39
00:03:50,379 --> 00:03:51,872
Yeah, we did.

40
00:03:51,896 --> 00:03:53,303
What are you reading?

41
00:03:53,755 --> 00:03:55,213
Um, just

42
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,411
stuff on physics.

43
00:03:57,694 --> 00:03:59,967
"An object in
motion"... You know.

44
00:04:01,528 --> 00:04:02,830
Well...

45
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,192
Just so you know

46
00:04:10,053 --> 00:04:12,598
you are the most remarkable
human I have ever met

47
00:04:12,623 --> 00:04:14,917
in my heretofore
uneventful life.

48
00:04:15,351 --> 00:04:17,312
Okay, let's not get
carried away here.

49
00:04:17,337 --> 00:04:19,021
You're beautiful in every way.

50
00:04:20,518 --> 00:04:21,787
Thank you.

51
00:04:31,269 --> 00:04:33,174
I have to get ready for work.

52
00:04:38,553 --> 00:04:40,800
If you're having
hesitation about what

53
00:04:40,825 --> 00:04:42,373
I've asked you to do...

54
00:04:44,535 --> 00:04:45,670
No.

55
00:04:46,009 --> 00:04:47,443
I said I'll do it.

56
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,131
I just, um...

57
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:52,912
Hey.

58
00:04:53,271 --> 00:04:54,815
You can tell me.

59
00:04:58,509 --> 00:05:01,792
I just can't stop thinking about
what happens after we do this.

60
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:05,847
This place pushes on people
to keep things the same.

61
00:05:07,093 --> 00:05:10,885
I just worry they'll keep
pushing till we all break.

62
00:05:26,145 --> 00:05:27,171
Clear.

63
00:05:33,601 --> 00:05:35,112
This room is clear!

64
00:05:35,964 --> 00:05:37,355
They're not splitting up.

65
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:39,225
- Clear!
- Yeah, they will.

66
00:05:39,593 --> 00:05:41,941
This might be our best
shot. No, it's too risky.

67
00:05:41,965 --> 00:05:44,122
We need to just get through
this and get back home.

68
00:05:44,147 --> 00:05:46,075
There is no "getting
through this," all right?

69
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,457
We are in the shit till we find
a way to fight our way out.

70
00:05:48,482 --> 00:05:50,889
Look, we keep heading
north, away from our group.

71
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:53,280
We find our moment, we take it.

72
00:05:53,355 --> 00:05:54,951
Hey, what's with the chit-chat?

73
00:05:55,482 --> 00:05:56,872
Man, we need a break.

74
00:05:56,896 --> 00:05:58,872
Been doing this for a while now.

75
00:05:58,897 --> 00:06:00,897
And we'llkeep doing
this for a while,

76
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,569
if that's what it takes.

77
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,320
Hey, you check Charleston yet?

78
00:06:05,344 --> 00:06:07,493
Why? What's in Charleston?

79
00:06:07,517 --> 00:06:09,355
There's a rumor
up on the rooftops

80
00:06:09,379 --> 00:06:11,389
they trade for
weapons and stuff.

81
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:13,460
Might be something, might not.

82
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:17,421
Move!

83
00:06:45,056 --> 00:06:46,711
Romano, what's your 20?

84
00:06:54,109 --> 00:06:57,548
13 miles past the last outpost.

85
00:06:57,827 --> 00:07:00,752
Second location is
cleared, one more to go.

86
00:07:01,167 --> 00:07:02,409
Copy that.

87
00:07:04,275 --> 00:07:05,548
Let's move.

88
00:07:11,111 --> 00:07:13,009
Hornsby's checking in on us.

89
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:15,431
We need to watch our backs.

90
00:07:15,815 --> 00:07:16,845
Yeah.

91
00:07:33,662 --> 00:07:35,560
Sounds like it's getting closer.

92
00:07:36,594 --> 00:07:38,036
Because it is.

93
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:45,396
Mom?

94
00:07:47,445 --> 00:07:48,525
I'm okay.

95
00:07:48,597 --> 00:07:49,903
No, you're not.

96
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,082
Hershel...

97
00:07:56,452 --> 00:07:58,200
Everything I've done...

98
00:08:00,218 --> 00:08:02,160
And everything I still do

99
00:08:03,239 --> 00:08:05,089
is so that we have choices.

100
00:08:05,434 --> 00:08:08,663
The place that we're going
right now, you may not like it.

101
00:08:08,827 --> 00:08:10,551
But I promise you,

102
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:13,161
it is the right choice.

103
00:08:13,749 --> 00:08:15,028
For now.

104
00:08:31,545 --> 00:08:33,629
Oh, you made it! This way.

105
00:08:41,579 --> 00:08:42,829
Exciting.

106
00:08:43,391 --> 00:08:44,861
Don't you think?

107
00:08:52,302 --> 00:08:54,234
Things are coming together.

108
00:08:57,969 --> 00:09:00,119
You get the scalp of the
woman who killed your family,

109
00:09:00,144 --> 00:09:02,661
and I finally get to do my
job without interference.

110
00:09:04,379 --> 00:09:05,829
Everybody wins.

111
00:09:06,928 --> 00:09:08,085
Well

112
00:09:08,379 --> 00:09:09,689
not everybody.

113
00:09:26,344 --> 00:09:27,620
I'll need to see.

114
00:09:33,206 --> 00:09:34,688
When she's dead.

115
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,673
I'll need to see
her when she's dead.

116
00:09:38,413 --> 00:09:39,665
You will.

117
00:09:39,689 --> 00:09:40,844
Come on.

118
00:10:13,133 --> 00:10:15,164
Okay, this thing is stuck.

119
00:10:31,517 --> 00:10:32,914
Maggie.

120
00:10:36,924 --> 00:10:38,315
Hey, kid.

121
00:10:38,905 --> 00:10:41,502
And you're sure this guy
Hornsby and his men are coming?

122
00:10:41,527 --> 00:10:44,189
Yes, Elijah spotted
a few of them 5 miles

123
00:10:44,214 --> 00:10:46,144
outside our walls last night.

124
00:10:47,954 --> 00:10:49,092
Thoughts?

125
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:52,683
You helped us,

126
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,386
and I am grateful.

127
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,630
And I got no problem
watching the kid at all.

128
00:10:59,655 --> 00:11:03,932
But, Annie, my
wife, is pregnant,

129
00:11:03,957 --> 00:11:06,941
so there is no way
I'm gonna sit in some.

130
00:11:06,965 --> 00:11:09,990
Whisperer worm hole
while you're out...

131
00:11:10,881 --> 00:11:13,317
I don't know... Saving
some shithole of a home

132
00:11:13,342 --> 00:11:14,389
that's not worth saving.

133
00:11:14,413 --> 00:11:15,864
Negan, don't.

134
00:11:15,889 --> 00:11:18,326
Actually, he's right.

135
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:22,155
Maybe Hilltop
isn't worth saving.

136
00:11:22,794 --> 00:11:24,185
Those people are.

137
00:11:25,172 --> 00:11:28,458
This fight that I'm
in, that I started,

138
00:11:28,482 --> 00:11:29,998
with Hornsby...

139
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:33,454
It's not gonna end
until I end it.

140
00:11:33,988 --> 00:11:35,967
And I got no doubt you will.

141
00:11:36,908 --> 00:11:39,643
But I also got no doubt
that you are firmly

142
00:11:39,668 --> 00:11:43,220
in the crosshairs of
this Lance asshole, so...

143
00:11:46,737 --> 00:11:47,989
So I'm coming with you.

144
00:11:48,014 --> 00:11:50,856
No. I'll finish it.

145
00:11:50,881 --> 00:11:53,148
Maggie, we can help
fight... No, please.

146
00:11:53,172 --> 00:11:55,817
I need you to stay
here... With Hershel,

147
00:11:55,842 --> 00:11:57,498
with those others.

148
00:11:57,724 --> 00:12:01,373
Keep them away from Hilltop
and safe until this is over.

149
00:12:01,827 --> 00:12:03,931
He doesn't exactly
trust me, you know?

150
00:12:06,372 --> 00:12:07,723
But I'm starting to.

151
00:12:11,925 --> 00:12:13,285
You saved him

152
00:12:14,253 --> 00:12:15,677
at Riverbend.

153
00:12:18,551 --> 00:12:20,763
Whatever else happens,

154
00:12:22,103 --> 00:12:24,693
and whatever else has happened,

155
00:12:25,923 --> 00:12:27,544
I will never forget that.

156
00:12:30,137 --> 00:12:31,218
Wow.

157
00:12:31,931 --> 00:12:34,827
You have big balls, Maggie Rhee.

158
00:12:37,655 --> 00:12:39,046
I got you.

159
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:41,206
And I got your boy.

160
00:12:47,337 --> 00:12:48,406
Annie...

161
00:12:48,431 --> 00:12:50,309
He'll be waiting for
you when this is done.

162
00:12:51,471 --> 00:12:53,265
I promise you that.

163
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,724
Thank you.

164
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:02,684
Oh, shit.

165
00:13:03,459 --> 00:13:06,114
If that ain't a sign
from the Man Upstairs.

166
00:13:27,862 --> 00:13:29,669
You at the second location?

167
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:32,513
Clearing that now.

168
00:13:32,965 --> 00:13:34,341
Finish.

169
00:13:34,931 --> 00:13:36,231
Then head back.

170
00:13:37,959 --> 00:13:39,787
Copy that, sir. We'll head back.

171
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,599
One last sweep, then home.

172
00:13:48,758 --> 00:13:50,356
All right, great.

173
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:52,653
I'll lead.

174
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:04,067
Cover left, cover left!

175
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:06,716
Aah!

176
00:15:14,989 --> 00:15:16,564
Keep 'em surrounded!

177
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,482
Flanking left! Cover me!

178
00:15:54,466 --> 00:15:56,442
Moving up! Cover me, cover me!

179
00:16:05,206 --> 00:16:07,309
Watch that left!
Watch that left!

180
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:07,988
Where's Hornsby?

181
00:17:08,441 --> 00:17:09,653
Screw you.

182
00:17:23,472 --> 00:17:24,990
It's your choice.

183
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:36,759
Maybe...

184
00:17:36,784 --> 00:17:38,196
Maybe 10 miles out.

185
00:17:39,539 --> 00:17:41,212
He said he wanted...

186
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:44,103
Said he wanted to
clear the field.

187
00:17:48,286 --> 00:17:49,477
"Clear the field"?

188
00:17:49,848 --> 00:17:51,641
Leave only allies behind.

189
00:17:53,809 --> 00:17:54,969
Maggie.

190
00:17:55,706 --> 00:17:57,154
Romano, you there?

191
00:18:02,491 --> 00:18:04,181
He ain't here anymore.

192
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,758
Move! Now!

193
00:18:23,718 --> 00:18:25,625
And when this world fell,

194
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:27,683
we gathered up the
scattered pieces,

195
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:29,595
and we put them
back together again.

196
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:33,712
It wasn't easy, and
we faltered at times.

197
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:36,023
But we found a reason to live

198
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:39,126
when everything
outside these walls

199
00:18:39,728 --> 00:18:40,947
was dead.

200
00:18:44,964 --> 00:18:46,118
Max?

201
00:18:50,931 --> 00:18:52,267
You okay?

202
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:53,885
You seem

203
00:18:53,965 --> 00:18:55,501
far away.

204
00:18:56,379 --> 00:18:58,361
No, I'm good.

205
00:18:58,896 --> 00:19:00,220
I'm right here.

206
00:19:00,809 --> 00:19:03,383
Max, if you're having a
bad day, you can tell me.

207
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,884
I do get it, you know?

208
00:19:06,392 --> 00:19:09,421
Always having to be "strong,"
never show any emotion.

209
00:19:09,446 --> 00:19:11,086
But if we can't show
that to each other,

210
00:19:11,111 --> 00:19:12,426
who can we show it to?

211
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:13,841
I appreciate it, Pamela.

212
00:19:13,945 --> 00:19:15,767
You know I do. But...

213
00:19:15,792 --> 00:19:17,516
I am really okay.

214
00:19:26,137 --> 00:19:28,376
Oh, before I forget.

215
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:32,157
Accounting sent over the
Founders' Day budget.

216
00:19:32,551 --> 00:19:35,389
There's a $50,000 surplus.

217
00:19:35,413 --> 00:19:36,941
Well, that's great.

218
00:19:36,965 --> 00:19:41,033
I was gonna suggest something,
if you're open to it?

219
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:44,493
How about starting
a scholarship fund

220
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:46,700
for our less-fortunate families?

221
00:19:46,724 --> 00:19:49,423
I've put together a
proposal, and we could...

222
00:19:50,413 --> 00:19:52,234
Is that... okay?

223
00:19:52,259 --> 00:19:54,570
Of course! I love your
out-of-the-box thinking.

224
00:19:54,595 --> 00:19:58,150
But any extra funds go
right back into the event.

225
00:19:58,484 --> 00:20:00,072
It's our biggest
day of the year.

226
00:20:01,586 --> 00:20:02,728
Sure.

227
00:20:03,137 --> 00:20:04,494
I understand.

228
00:20:05,533 --> 00:20:07,141
You really should get going.

229
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:09,072
You've got that 5:00 dinner.

230
00:20:09,809 --> 00:20:12,188
Yes, thank you.

231
00:20:14,482 --> 00:20:16,447
I don't know what I'd
do without you, Max.

232
00:20:20,772 --> 00:20:22,876
You're leaving soon, too, right?

233
00:20:24,829 --> 00:20:26,212
Right behind you.

234
00:21:34,978 --> 00:21:36,016
Hey.

235
00:21:38,374 --> 00:21:40,453
I'm so sorry. I didn't
mean to scare you.

236
00:21:40,478 --> 00:21:41,562
No, Sebastian, hi.

237
00:21:41,586 --> 00:21:43,589
Uh, no, you didn't.

238
00:21:43,614 --> 00:21:44,870
Is there something
that I can help you...

239
00:21:44,894 --> 00:21:46,814
Yes, uh, is... is...

240
00:21:47,068 --> 00:21:49,220
Uh, is my mom pissed at me?

241
00:21:49,245 --> 00:21:51,684
You know, 'cause I keep
asking for her, and... and

242
00:21:51,709 --> 00:21:52,887
nothing, so...

243
00:21:52,912 --> 00:21:54,874
It's just been a
hectic afternoon, so...

244
00:21:54,899 --> 00:21:56,563
I gotta talk to her,
so could you just...

245
00:21:56,673 --> 00:21:58,458
If you could get
her for me, Max...

246
00:21:58,482 --> 00:22:00,417
She's actually at a work dinner,

247
00:22:00,442 --> 00:22:02,166
but I can get word
to her for you.

248
00:22:03,517 --> 00:22:05,517
"Get word to her"?

249
00:22:06,655 --> 00:22:08,803
Yeah, yeah, why...

250
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:12,223
Why don't you go "get
word" to her for me.

251
00:22:12,796 --> 00:22:14,554
Her only child.

252
00:22:15,817 --> 00:22:18,792
That is such bullshit.

253
00:22:18,817 --> 00:22:21,001
I'm really sorry, Sebastian,

254
00:22:21,026 --> 00:22:22,598
but I was actually
on my way out, so...

255
00:22:22,623 --> 00:22:24,434
Oh, you never stop!

256
00:22:25,551 --> 00:22:27,536
But, working, working, hey.

257
00:22:27,771 --> 00:22:28,855
You just...

258
00:22:29,247 --> 00:22:31,389
Oh, God, I mean, you even
take it home with you?

259
00:22:31,413 --> 00:22:33,125
Oh, no, that's... I... I got it.

260
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:34,874
It's okay. That's fine.

261
00:22:37,263 --> 00:22:42,057
Always clumsy after one too many
afternoon coffees, you know?

262
00:22:50,358 --> 00:22:51,921
Yeah, it's, uh

263
00:22:54,255 --> 00:22:55,841
poor man's drug.

264
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:58,843
Caffeine.

265
00:24:13,835 --> 00:24:15,374
No sign of Hornsby.

266
00:24:15,633 --> 00:24:18,529
Asshole always has somebody
else do his dirty work.

267
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:20,608
See if we can recover
any of their weapons.

268
00:24:20,633 --> 00:24:22,169
Follow their trail
back to their camp,

269
00:24:22,194 --> 00:24:23,671
and then we end this.

270
00:24:23,921 --> 00:24:24,967
On it.

271
00:24:25,413 --> 00:24:26,493
You ready, bud?

272
00:24:26,517 --> 00:24:27,569
As ever.

273
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:28,968
Let's do it.

274
00:24:32,202 --> 00:24:33,250
Marco!

275
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,103
Get down!

276
00:24:45,806 --> 00:24:47,461
No. Marco!

277
00:24:49,364 --> 00:24:50,916
Go, go.

278
00:26:01,608 --> 00:26:02,838
How many?

279
00:26:04,186 --> 00:26:05,369
Three.

280
00:26:09,544 --> 00:26:11,044
Leah, your 20?

281
00:26:14,166 --> 00:26:15,908
Leah, what the hell was that?!

282
00:26:16,219 --> 00:26:17,622
I drew 'em out.

283
00:26:18,078 --> 00:26:19,533
I'm doin' this my way.

284
00:26:19,826 --> 00:26:21,685
Your way got my men killed!

285
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:23,201
Collateral damage.

286
00:26:30,252 --> 00:26:32,658
I've got others fanned
over a 20-mile perimeter.

287
00:26:32,827 --> 00:26:34,314
We'll find them.

288
00:26:34,602 --> 00:26:36,257
You goddamned better.

289
00:26:47,444 --> 00:26:49,079
His troopers are here.

290
00:26:49,732 --> 00:26:51,283
He's gotta be close.

291
00:26:51,517 --> 00:26:52,650
Yeah.

292
00:26:53,448 --> 00:26:54,963
We got walkers, too.

293
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:06,838
He set traps for them.

294
00:27:08,413 --> 00:27:09,994
These aren't for them.

295
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:40,798
What is it?

296
00:27:42,334 --> 00:27:43,541
Leah.

297
00:27:47,924 --> 00:27:50,683
I think we should split
up, cover more ground.

298
00:28:14,696 --> 00:28:16,174
You sure it was her?

299
00:28:16,199 --> 00:28:17,212
Yes.

300
00:28:17,379 --> 00:28:18,734
Go, please.

301
00:28:18,758 --> 00:28:20,304
I'll lead Leah and
the others away.

302
00:28:20,329 --> 00:28:21,577
I am not gonna leave you.

303
00:28:21,602 --> 00:28:23,803
I will not risk losing you two.

304
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:25,945
We can handle
ourselves, Maggie, okay?

305
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:28,540
We'll draw them away, too, and
then, when everyone's safe,

306
00:28:28,565 --> 00:28:30,157
we'll just go meet
up with the others.

307
00:28:32,009 --> 00:28:33,767
I'll find you. Go.

308
00:29:12,507 --> 00:29:14,993
Tyler Davis is on this list.

309
00:29:16,634 --> 00:29:18,741
And the woman Rosita
tried to help out

310
00:29:18,766 --> 00:29:20,907
during the heist
is on here, too.

311
00:29:22,255 --> 00:29:24,227
I counted 200 more.

312
00:29:25,103 --> 00:29:26,954
What about these numbers?

313
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:29,054
They look like... codes?

314
00:29:29,079 --> 00:29:30,458
Maybe coordinates?

315
00:29:30,482 --> 00:29:33,865
So you think this is about
where they're hiding people.

316
00:29:34,738 --> 00:29:36,679
Why don't we write about that?

317
00:29:36,758 --> 00:29:39,396
No, not yet.

318
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:41,458
I need proof.

319
00:29:43,164 --> 00:29:47,174
Something this big,
this explosive?

320
00:29:47,448 --> 00:29:50,185
We... We need a key
to crack the code.

321
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:52,559
U-Until we have that,

322
00:29:53,922 --> 00:29:56,607
I'll write about
Sebastian's heist,

323
00:29:57,435 --> 00:29:59,293
and hang it around
Pamela's neck.

324
00:29:59,318 --> 00:30:03,404
I mean, when everyone finds out
that she's not on their side,

325
00:30:03,521 --> 00:30:05,907
they're gonna question
everything about this place.

326
00:30:06,031 --> 00:30:08,201
Hence the
aforementioned uprising.

327
00:30:10,724 --> 00:30:12,924
No, hey, hey, hey!
It's... It's okay.

328
00:30:12,949 --> 00:30:16,193
I thought we could use
help, so I told him to come.

329
00:30:18,654 --> 00:30:20,060
Sorry I'm late.

330
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:22,910
Trying to round up a
few more for the cause.

331
00:30:22,935 --> 00:30:24,738
- Geez.
- I told him

332
00:30:24,763 --> 00:30:27,832
we'd needed more people
to get the article out.

333
00:30:27,857 --> 00:30:31,551
And I got a whole network, ready
and willing to ride at dawn.

334
00:30:36,478 --> 00:30:37,961
We're doing this?

335
00:30:48,931 --> 00:30:50,232
Let's ride.

336
00:33:45,623 --> 00:33:49,002
I have waited for this
moment for a long time.

337
00:33:54,634 --> 00:33:56,392
I know what you want.

338
00:33:59,769 --> 00:34:02,286
I wanted it myself
for a long time.

339
00:34:04,508 --> 00:34:07,059
You can't kill me.
That would be too easy.

340
00:34:08,847 --> 00:34:11,503
If that was what you wanted,
you would've done it already.

341
00:34:19,461 --> 00:34:21,254
You want me to suffer.

342
00:34:22,637 --> 00:34:24,995
Feel everything that you felt.

343
00:34:25,598 --> 00:34:27,044
All the pain.

344
00:34:31,068 --> 00:34:32,421
'Cause somewhere inside you,

345
00:34:32,446 --> 00:34:34,154
you think that'll
take away your pain.

346
00:34:38,546 --> 00:34:39,762
It won't.

347
00:34:44,299 --> 00:34:45,731
You're wrong.

348
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:48,583
It's not just you.

349
00:34:52,602 --> 00:34:54,474
By the time I'm done...

350
00:34:55,967 --> 00:34:58,810
Everyone you love will be dead.

351
00:35:25,169 --> 00:35:27,390
Then I guess that makes us even.

352
00:35:27,811 --> 00:35:29,718
I took your family,

353
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:31,232
you take mine.

354
00:35:37,126 --> 00:35:39,328
Nature has a way of taking
care of these things.

355
00:35:39,353 --> 00:35:40,875
It's not nature.

356
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,142
Or fate.

357
00:35:43,466 --> 00:35:44,742
It's us.

358
00:35:46,847 --> 00:35:50,892
I killed your people because
it was what I wanted.

359
00:35:51,935 --> 00:35:54,038
If this is what
you want, Leah...

360
00:35:58,285 --> 00:35:59,555
Go ahead.

361
00:36:01,923 --> 00:36:04,204
You want it, so do it.

362
00:36:05,109 --> 00:36:06,446
Go on.

363
00:36:09,101 --> 00:36:10,170
Hyah!

364
00:37:37,332 --> 00:37:38,555
They're in there!

365
00:37:47,649 --> 00:37:48,773
Sir, are you okay?

366
00:37:48,798 --> 00:37:50,071
Let it go! On the other side!

367
00:37:50,096 --> 00:37:51,348
Who's my backup here?

368
00:37:51,421 --> 00:37:52,507
Hold your fire!

369
00:38:19,298 --> 00:38:21,333
Now we take it all.

370
00:41:22,294 --> 00:41:23,482
Oh, shit.

371
00:41:24,306 --> 00:41:26,754
If that ain't a sign
from the Man Upstairs.

372
00:41:26,779 --> 00:41:30,822
The locusts, in some ways
it's an atmospheric element.

373
00:41:30,847 --> 00:41:32,209
It's just part of, like,

374
00:41:32,234 --> 00:41:35,279
the sense of the world
itself is hostile.

375
00:41:35,551 --> 00:41:38,943
I think for our heroes,
this overwhelming sound

376
00:41:38,968 --> 00:41:42,012
is part of, like, what
makes things complicated,

377
00:41:42,037 --> 00:41:45,434
because it makes it harder to
hear Leah coming, for example.

378
00:41:45,459 --> 00:41:48,059
But, on the other hand,
they're looking at it

379
00:41:48,084 --> 00:41:50,691
as kind of like this
unsettling thing,

380
00:41:50,716 --> 00:41:52,582
which is this a problem for them

381
00:41:52,607 --> 00:41:54,629
in terms of, like,
being, like, a harbinger

382
00:41:54,654 --> 00:41:56,655
of more problems to come.

383
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,817
Seems like it's getting closer.

384
00:41:59,607 --> 00:42:01,009
Because it is.

385
00:42:01,034 --> 00:42:03,551
There's just a lot running
through their heads

386
00:42:03,576 --> 00:42:08,334
as they're seeing, like, nature
just act up and be their enemy.

387
00:42:13,897 --> 00:42:14,897
Maggie.

388
00:42:15,568 --> 00:42:17,293
I think, like, a lot of things

389
00:42:17,318 --> 00:42:19,886
started to shift in
that relationship,

390
00:42:19,911 --> 00:42:22,474
'cause there's a couple of things
that I think are really key.

391
00:42:22,990 --> 00:42:24,020
Go.

392
00:42:25,098 --> 00:42:28,732
Negan put the call
out to help to Maggie.

393
00:42:28,757 --> 00:42:30,619
So, when they were in a jam,

394
00:42:30,834 --> 00:42:32,754
that's the person that
he sent a letter to,

395
00:42:32,779 --> 00:42:35,802
and he sent that rider to
Hilltop to call for help.

396
00:42:36,078 --> 00:42:38,130
And the thing is, Maggie came.

397
00:42:38,354 --> 00:42:40,074
And I think for Maggie's side,

398
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:44,488
she saw that Negan vowed to make
sure that Hershel stayed okay,

399
00:42:44,513 --> 00:42:47,209
and that was the end result.

400
00:42:47,539 --> 00:42:49,435
He doesn't exactly
trust me, you know?

401
00:42:51,891 --> 00:42:53,374
But I'm starting to.

402
00:42:53,748 --> 00:42:56,059
She has not forgiven him,

403
00:42:56,084 --> 00:42:59,209
and I don't think she's
ever going to forget.

404
00:42:59,234 --> 00:43:01,879
But there is something
different about the idea

405
00:43:01,904 --> 00:43:05,654
of saying, like, "But I
can trust you as an ally."

406
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:07,379
I got you.

407
00:43:07,928 --> 00:43:09,479
And I got your boy.

408
00:43:09,584 --> 00:43:12,354
She knows she has to trust
somebody with Hershel

409
00:43:12,379 --> 00:43:16,318
because something is coming that
she's going to have to face.

410
00:43:16,492 --> 00:43:17,871
I'll finish it.

411
00:43:17,896 --> 00:43:19,896
Maggie, we can help
fight... No, please.

412
00:43:20,172 --> 00:43:22,569
I need you to stay
here... With Hershel,

413
00:43:22,594 --> 00:43:24,112
with those others.

414
00:43:24,417 --> 00:43:26,693
Maggie also trusts Annie.

415
00:43:26,896 --> 00:43:30,260
I think she gets the vibe
that Annie is a good person.

416
00:43:30,285 --> 00:43:33,009
I think she thinks that
Annie grounds Negan

417
00:43:33,034 --> 00:43:35,363
in some kind of way
that's interesting.

418
00:43:35,388 --> 00:43:37,738
Like, she's, like, reading
all those dynamics.

419
00:43:37,763 --> 00:43:41,309
She's feeling like the
person that he wound up with

420
00:43:41,334 --> 00:43:44,716
is somebody that is as good
a person as, like, any of us.

421
00:43:44,741 --> 00:43:45,990
And I think she's right.

422
00:43:46,724 --> 00:43:48,201
I don't want to go.

423
00:43:48,827 --> 00:43:50,701
It's only temporary, okay?

424
00:43:52,196 --> 00:43:53,471
I promise.

425
00:43:53,704 --> 00:43:57,631
She's really realizing,
like, maybe she's holding

426
00:43:57,656 --> 00:44:00,944
onto something that's
the wrong version

427
00:44:00,969 --> 00:44:02,606
of what she wants to hold onto.

428
00:44:02,631 --> 00:44:05,584
And I think what she
wants to hold onto

429
00:44:05,656 --> 00:44:07,660
is a sense of community,

430
00:44:07,685 --> 00:44:10,473
the memory of the
people that she lost.

431
00:44:10,498 --> 00:44:12,769
You know, Glenn is
buried at the Hilltop.

432
00:44:12,794 --> 00:44:17,191
But does the Barrington
house itself matter?

433
00:44:17,216 --> 00:44:19,676
And I think, like, that's
something that she's kind of

434
00:44:19,701 --> 00:44:21,310
taking from the conversation.

435
00:44:21,413 --> 00:44:23,066
She's come to the conclusion

436
00:44:23,091 --> 00:44:24,576
that people are
the most important,

437
00:44:24,601 --> 00:44:27,263
but that does mean that we
have to make a stand here.

438
00:44:34,255 --> 00:44:35,949
Follow their trail
back to their camp,

439
00:44:35,974 --> 00:44:37,270
and then we end this.

440
00:44:37,295 --> 00:44:39,660
She really is like
a good war leader,

441
00:44:39,685 --> 00:44:41,319
and she's a good strategist.

442
00:44:41,344 --> 00:44:44,521
I think the thing that she
did not see coming was Leah.

443
00:44:46,341 --> 00:44:48,418
That is a fight of pure hatred.

444
00:44:48,443 --> 00:44:51,060
They cannot stand each other.

445
00:44:51,326 --> 00:44:55,246
When you get caught in
a cycle of violence,

446
00:44:55,271 --> 00:44:58,355
and, like, revenge,
where is the end point

447
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:00,637
when it's one retaliation
after another,

448
00:45:00,662 --> 00:45:03,340
because Maggie feels like
Leah was the aggressor.

449
00:45:03,365 --> 00:45:05,223
"Her and her people came
and killed my people."

450
00:45:05,248 --> 00:45:07,957
And Leah feels like, "But
we made a deal with you

451
00:45:07,982 --> 00:45:10,730
in good faith, and then you
shot my people in the back,

452
00:45:10,755 --> 00:45:11,871
and you tried to kill me."

453
00:45:11,896 --> 00:45:15,551
I have waited for this
moment for a long time.

454
00:45:15,897 --> 00:45:17,242
I know what you want.

455
00:45:18,488 --> 00:45:20,962
I wanted it myself
for a long time.

456
00:45:21,044 --> 00:45:23,121
They cannot see eye-to-eye

457
00:45:23,146 --> 00:45:24,894
because they're both
people who are leaders

458
00:45:24,919 --> 00:45:28,562
that feel like the other person
was responsible for the murder

459
00:45:28,587 --> 00:45:29,974
of everybody that they loved.

460
00:45:30,251 --> 00:45:31,262
Yah!

461
00:45:32,275 --> 00:45:36,612
For Leah, she also wants to see
Maggie suffer the way she did.

462
00:45:36,637 --> 00:45:40,574
And so, in some ways, that
might have been her mistake

463
00:45:40,599 --> 00:45:44,615
as a villain, rather than just
taking a shot when she could.

464
00:45:47,354 --> 00:45:49,801
For Daryl, Maggie's
like his sister,

465
00:45:49,826 --> 00:45:52,691
and Daryl always feels like
he owes a debt to Maggie.

466
00:45:52,716 --> 00:45:55,207
So, there's not even,
like, a moment of like,

467
00:45:55,232 --> 00:45:56,404
"What do I choose?"

468
00:45:56,429 --> 00:45:57,459
There's nothing to choose.

469
00:45:57,483 --> 00:45:59,043
The only choice he
could make is Maggie.

470
00:46:00,849 --> 00:46:01,886
Sir, are you okay?

471
00:46:01,911 --> 00:46:06,019
For Hornsby, this is a no-good,
very bad, horrible day.

472
00:46:06,044 --> 00:46:08,184
Part of what's still
driving Hornsby

473
00:46:08,209 --> 00:46:11,013
is he doesn't want this
to get back to Pamela.

474
00:46:11,083 --> 00:46:14,437
And the bigger
this mess becomes,

475
00:46:14,462 --> 00:46:16,201
the harder it's gonna
be to cover it up.

476
00:46:16,226 --> 00:46:19,201
Now it's just become, like, "I
need to wipe out the threat."

477
00:46:19,226 --> 00:46:20,601
Everybody who is out here,

478
00:46:20,626 --> 00:46:22,386
like, they've got a
target on their back now.

479
00:46:27,181 --> 00:46:28,294
Call it.

480
00:46:29,275 --> 00:46:30,379
Tails, I guess.

481
00:46:32,378 --> 00:46:34,811
We've been talking
a lot about luck

482
00:46:34,836 --> 00:46:36,642
in this block of episodes.

483
00:46:36,667 --> 00:46:38,087
We want to believe

484
00:46:38,112 --> 00:46:40,431
that everything is
within our control.

485
00:46:40,456 --> 00:46:42,673
But is it truly all
within our control?

486
00:46:42,698 --> 00:46:44,743
I think that's something
that all of our characters

487
00:46:44,768 --> 00:46:47,509
in varying ways
are grappling with.

488
00:46:47,534 --> 00:46:50,003
And we've got a lot of
characters in this episode

489
00:46:50,028 --> 00:46:51,166
that are feeling like,

490
00:46:51,197 --> 00:46:54,311
"I want to, like, snatch
fate into my hands

491
00:46:54,336 --> 00:46:56,479
so that it's not just
a flip of the coin."

492
00:46:56,504 --> 00:46:58,303
It's not just what
somebody tells you

493
00:46:58,328 --> 00:46:59,914

494
00:46:59,939 --> 00:47:02,526
I think that's really, like,
where a lot of our characters

495
00:47:02,551 --> 00:47:05,962
are feeling at sea when they
reach this block of episodes,

496
00:47:05,987 --> 00:47:08,509

497
00:47:08,534 --> 00:47:10,636
continue going as we
get into the final block

498
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:11,690
of the series.

499
00:47:12,305 --> 00:48:12,822
