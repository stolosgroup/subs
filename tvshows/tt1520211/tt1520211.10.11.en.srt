1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,825
...cave where Alpha
has placed her horde.

2
00:00:06,374 --> 00:00:07,215
- Aah!
- Aah!

3
00:00:07,291 --> 00:00:07,924
Where are they?!

4
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:13,613
This place...
it isn't what she said it was.

5
00:00:13,689 --> 00:00:16,782
- She lied.
- She is your Alpha.

6
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:25,358
I'm no longer weak.
I'm stronger than ever.

7

8
00:01:00,344 --> 00:01:02,344
Does this mean
I've graduated

9
00:01:02,346 --> 00:01:06,832
to the next level
of kinky Whisperer shit?

10
00:01:06,834 --> 00:01:09,926
You joke
to hide your fear.

11
00:01:16,193 --> 00:01:19,603
You know, seems to me
you've been cut up enough.

12
00:01:19,605 --> 00:01:22,848
Begin.

13
00:01:31,617 --> 00:01:34,043
Again.

14
00:01:47,917 --> 00:01:49,466
Now you.

15
00:01:51,303 --> 00:01:54,805
Ah, does this mean
we're bonded for life?

16
00:01:54,807 --> 00:01:56,882
Depends.

17
00:01:59,721 --> 00:02:03,055
Aah.

18
00:02:08,412 --> 00:02:18,179
We are the end...

19
00:02:18,181 --> 00:02:23,184
of the world...

20
00:02:23,186 --> 00:02:29,190
We are the end...

21
00:02:29,192 --> 00:02:35,087
of the world...

22
00:02:35,089 --> 00:02:40,442
We are
the end of the world.

23
00:02:40,444 --> 00:02:47,691
We take them all.

24
00:02:47,693 --> 00:02:55,107
We take them all.

25
00:02:55,109 --> 00:03:01,222
We take them all.

26
00:03:01,224 --> 00:03:06,118
We take them all.

27
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,881
We take them all.

Subtitles by explosiveskull

29
00:03:59,615 --> 00:04:02,265
I counted three
last night.

30
00:04:02,267 --> 00:04:04,267
You?

31
00:04:04,269 --> 00:04:05,953
This music library
is about as helpful

32
00:04:05,955 --> 00:04:07,270
as sushi
on a carburetor.

33
00:04:07,272 --> 00:04:09,790
Said LP
seems to be M.I.A.

34
00:04:09,792 --> 00:04:12,034
You want me to hear it,
I think you should sing it.

35
00:04:12,036 --> 00:04:13,368
Just belt it,
baby.

36
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:15,020
I will not.

37
00:04:15,022 --> 00:04:17,298
Only a fool would attempt
such a song

38
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,374
sans epic
string accompaniment.

39
00:04:19,376 --> 00:04:22,261
So how many, then?

40
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:28,050
Yester-eve,
I tallied a flea's tush shy

41
00:04:28,052 --> 00:04:31,553
of four astro projectiles
plummeting to earth.

42
00:04:31,555 --> 00:04:33,706
So three
shooting stars.

43
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:35,649
You're still up
by two.

44
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:38,544
You better not be
counting satellites.

45
00:04:38,546 --> 00:04:39,803
Satellites?

46
00:04:39,805 --> 00:04:41,972
Yeah, I saw one
falling recently.

47
00:04:41,974 --> 00:04:44,550
Around sunset?

48
00:04:44,552 --> 00:04:47,402
Yeah,
around sunset.

49
00:04:47,404 --> 00:04:50,072
We're close.

50
00:04:50,074 --> 00:04:52,241
Only a few hundred miles

51
00:04:52,243 --> 00:04:54,560
per satellite's
visibility range.

52
00:04:56,822 --> 00:04:59,231
As promised,
I have not spilled the beans

53
00:04:59,233 --> 00:05:01,250
on our audio rendezvous
to anyone.

54
00:05:01,252 --> 00:05:02,843
But, well,
said satellite

55
00:05:02,845 --> 00:05:04,661
provided the kick
in the deuce-bucket required

56
00:05:04,663 --> 00:05:06,638
to tickle your ear drums
with this radio

57
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,015
in the first place.

58
00:05:08,017 --> 00:05:09,850
I just
can't help but believe

59
00:05:09,852 --> 00:05:11,334
that this is
a celestially ordained

60
00:05:11,336 --> 00:05:13,336
meet-and-greet.

61
00:05:13,338 --> 00:05:15,689
No bean-spillage here,
either.

62
00:05:15,691 --> 00:05:18,692
But my people
are uber cautious, Eugene.

63
00:05:18,694 --> 00:05:20,343
And if we're close...

64
00:05:20,345 --> 00:05:21,695
Virginia.

65
00:05:21,697 --> 00:05:24,347
I'm in Virginia.

66
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:33,115
I'd like to proffer
a simple-as-ABC scenario

67
00:05:33,117 --> 00:05:36,118
as to how we can
safely face-to-face.

68
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,712
You pick the day
and the neck of the woods.

69
00:05:38,714 --> 00:05:41,364
Perch yourself out of sight,
get the eyeball.

70
00:05:41,366 --> 00:05:43,366
You don't like
the cut of my jib,

71
00:05:43,368 --> 00:05:44,718
you <i>adiós</i> yourself.

72
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,445
Easy peasy.

73
00:05:48,891 --> 00:05:51,617
Truth is, Stephanie,

74
00:05:51,619 --> 00:05:54,728
I'd just very much
like to meet you.

75
00:05:56,624 --> 00:05:58,232
I'd really like
to meet you, too.

76
00:05:58,234 --> 00:05:59,641
Okay.

77
00:05:59,643 --> 00:06:00,901
I'll talk
to my people.

78
00:06:00,903 --> 00:06:02,628
And I'll do the same.

79
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,738
No.
Don't tell anyone yet.

80
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:07,557
Let's see
what my people say first.

81
00:06:07,559 --> 00:06:08,909
Will do, Waterloo.

82
00:06:08,911 --> 00:06:10,911
I promise.

83
00:06:27,838 --> 00:06:30,264
Who's that?

84
00:06:32,843 --> 00:06:35,995
Never seen her before.

85
00:06:35,997 --> 00:06:38,497
Alexandria taking in
another stray?

86
00:06:38,499 --> 00:06:40,666
No, they gotta be
locked down.

87
00:06:40,668 --> 00:06:43,277
Well, they've brought 'em
to us before.

88
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,196
Hey. Hey!

89
00:06:54,198 --> 00:06:56,181
Who is that?

90
00:06:57,793 --> 00:06:59,793
Hi, Earl.
It's Mary.

91
00:06:59,795 --> 00:07:02,371
She, uh,
ran away from Alpha's camp.

92
00:07:02,373 --> 00:07:04,298
She's been
helping us out.

93
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:07,450
What's she doing here?

94
00:07:07,452 --> 00:07:11,213
Her nephew
is, uh, Adam.

95
00:07:11,215 --> 00:07:12,881
She wants
to see him.

96
00:07:12,883 --> 00:07:14,216
No.

97
00:07:14,218 --> 00:07:16,218
Okay, Earl,
can we talk about this?

98
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,627
You said
you were gonna bring people

99
00:07:17,629 --> 00:07:18,979
who wanted
to see Alex...

100
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:20,981
not one of our enemies
that wants to see my son.

101
00:07:20,983 --> 00:07:23,299
- She's not an enemy.
- You don't know that.

102
00:07:23,301 --> 00:07:24,777
You keep her away
from my kid.

103
00:07:25,988 --> 00:07:28,864
Earl. Earl.

104
00:07:30,475 --> 00:07:33,402
What the hell did he think
I was gonna say?

105
00:07:33,404 --> 00:07:36,405
Those people left that kid
out there to die.

106
00:07:36,407 --> 00:07:38,148
They see Alex,
and then they go.

107
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:39,500
That's it.

108
00:07:39,502 --> 00:07:41,059
Just 'cause
they came here wanting something

109
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:42,244
doesn't mean
they're gonna get it.

110
00:07:42,246 --> 00:07:45,247
I'll handle it,
okay?

111
00:08:10,366 --> 00:08:12,866
How'd you find me?

112
00:08:14,278 --> 00:08:15,610
This was Daryl's place,
right?

113
00:08:15,612 --> 00:08:19,765
I thought you needed
some comfort.

114
00:08:19,767 --> 00:08:21,600
Mm. I don't.

115
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:25,862
Jerry and Kelly
made it back to Hilltop.

116
00:08:25,864 --> 00:08:28,290
I heard what happened
at the cave.

117
00:08:28,292 --> 00:08:30,776
I was worried
about you.

118
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:38,784
Come on back.

119
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:58,820
Or I'll just sit here
with you, and...

120
00:08:58,822 --> 00:09:03,083
we'll get eaten
by mosquitos together.

121
00:09:12,244 --> 00:09:14,002
Ah, Kel,
this is nuts.

122
00:09:14,004 --> 00:09:15,411
You can hardly walk.

123
00:09:15,413 --> 00:09:18,748
I'm not leaving my sister
out there.

124
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,892
I'm going
with you guys.

125
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:22,344
Miko,
help me out here.

126
00:09:22,346 --> 00:09:24,104
What was the last thing
Magna said to you?

127
00:09:24,106 --> 00:09:25,664
Why does it matter?

128
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:26,999
We're getting 'em back.

129
00:09:27,001 --> 00:09:28,609
Yeah,
and what if we don't?

130
00:09:28,611 --> 00:09:30,277
You know?

131
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:32,428
All we're ever gonna know
is that damn ceiling caved in.

132
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:34,281
If you think
that they're dead,

133
00:09:34,283 --> 00:09:36,024
why are you
coming with us?

134
00:09:45,035 --> 00:09:46,868
Any sign of them?

135
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:48,337
We didn't get
that far.

136
00:09:48,339 --> 00:09:50,689
What do you mean?
What happened?

137
00:09:50,691 --> 00:09:52,024
We gotta talk.

138
00:09:52,026 --> 00:09:53,208
D, I'm sorry.

139
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:55,135
We gotta find
our people, man.

140
00:09:55,137 --> 00:09:57,863
No.
You can't go out there.

141
00:09:57,865 --> 00:09:59,723
My mother's coming.

142
00:10:06,206 --> 00:10:08,557
Eugene?

143
00:10:13,564 --> 00:10:15,638
Blue Weevil
to Tater Bug...

144
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:18,308
one more question
about that satellite.

145
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:19,642
Hello?

146
00:10:19,644 --> 00:10:22,888
Who is this?

147
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:24,881
- No. No!
- Anyone there?

148
00:10:24,883 --> 00:10:26,391
- Who is th... Hello?
- Go away. Go away.

149
00:10:26,393 --> 00:10:27,576
Come in.

150
00:10:27,578 --> 00:10:29,227
- What?
- Stephanie!

151
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:31,004
Stephanie!

152
00:10:31,006 --> 00:10:33,065
Stephanie?!

153
00:10:34,501 --> 00:10:36,918
Is somebody getting action
at Oceanside?

154
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,904
You need to go.
Now.

155
00:10:40,674 --> 00:10:43,483
You look terrible.

156
00:10:44,854 --> 00:10:47,837
Yeah, a giant Whisperer
took a swipe at me.

157
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,097
I'm fine, thanks.

158
00:10:49,099 --> 00:10:50,765
W-What's up your butt?

159
00:10:50,767 --> 00:10:54,586
She trusted me to keep our chats
mano-a-mano, and you...

160
00:10:54,588 --> 00:10:57,013
You just made me
break my promise.

161
00:10:58,801 --> 00:11:00,367
Now, go...

162
00:11:00,369 --> 00:11:03,537
before I say something
I truly regret.

163
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:21,388
Blue Weevil, uh, that was
a mistake, a terrible mistake.

164
00:11:23,692 --> 00:11:26,635
I'm... I'm sorry.

165
00:11:26,637 --> 00:11:30,288
Blue Weevil,
do you copy, please?

166
00:11:33,702 --> 00:11:37,404
Got a little
unsolicited advice...

167
00:11:37,406 --> 00:11:40,407
everyone's favorite kind,
I know,

168
00:11:40,409 --> 00:11:42,725
but I can't
help myself.

169
00:11:42,727 --> 00:11:46,896
And maybe I thought of an idea
that you haven't yet.

170
00:11:46,898 --> 00:11:50,066
I respect
a well-deserved massacre.

171
00:11:50,068 --> 00:11:52,969
Some people...
they just have it coming.

172
00:11:52,971 --> 00:11:55,330
And I get why
you want to take out

173
00:11:55,332 --> 00:11:56,982
Hilltop and Alexandria.

174
00:11:56,984 --> 00:12:01,428
It would just...
It would feel good.

175
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:06,491
But you know what might feel
goddamn fantastic?

176
00:12:06,493 --> 00:12:10,437
Getting those assholes
to surrender,

177
00:12:10,439 --> 00:12:13,331
bend a knee.

178
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:17,686
Alpha, we can get them
to join us.

179
00:12:17,688 --> 00:12:20,338
Explain.

180
00:12:22,343 --> 00:12:23,933
Eyes open.

181
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:25,694
Any sign of a horde approach
or Whisperer movement,

182
00:12:25,696 --> 00:12:27,103
you radio us immediately.

183
00:12:27,105 --> 00:12:28,455
Be safe.

184
00:12:28,457 --> 00:12:29,939
You heard them
out there.

185
00:12:29,941 --> 00:12:31,291
We have to go.

186
00:12:31,293 --> 00:12:34,110
Even if you took out
half the herd in that cave,

187
00:12:34,112 --> 00:12:35,537
she's got
thousands left.

188
00:12:35,539 --> 00:12:37,038
You can't stay here.

189
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,948
The skins could march
straight to Alexandria

190
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:40,208
for all we know.

191
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:41,784
Yeah,
we're right in their way.

192
00:12:41,786 --> 00:12:43,136
Maybe she goes
around us.

193
00:12:43,138 --> 00:12:45,030
She doesn't need
to go around you.

194
00:12:45,032 --> 00:12:46,948
She'll just
run through you.

195
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:48,383
I'm not
running again.

196
00:12:48,385 --> 00:12:50,369
- Hell, no.
- Lydia's right.

197
00:12:50,371 --> 00:12:51,553
We can
rebuild anywhere.

198
00:12:51,555 --> 00:12:53,054
Come on.
We can't.

199
00:12:53,056 --> 00:12:54,815
How many scouting missions
you been on, son?

200
00:12:54,817 --> 00:12:56,149
Hundreds?

201
00:12:56,151 --> 00:12:59,377
Have you ever seen
a place like Hilltop?

202
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:01,229
No.

203
00:13:02,807 --> 00:13:04,716
We have a few dozen
able-bodied fighters here.

204
00:13:04,718 --> 00:13:05,900
Maybe.

205
00:13:05,902 --> 00:13:07,310
You like those odds?

206
00:13:07,312 --> 00:13:09,145
- 'Cause I don't.
- Neither do I.

207
00:13:09,147 --> 00:13:11,147
Now, we don't
have to die here.

208
00:13:11,149 --> 00:13:13,241
We're going to
have to fight,

209
00:13:13,243 --> 00:13:14,668
and if we die,

210
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:17,504
we die fighting for a place
that means something.

211
00:13:17,506 --> 00:13:19,564
Can you think of
a better way to go?

212
00:13:19,566 --> 00:13:20,899
Yeah.

213
00:13:20,901 --> 00:13:23,752
We go with
my daughter's life intact.

214
00:13:23,754 --> 00:13:26,829
And Judith's
and Ezra's and Adam's.

215
00:13:26,831 --> 00:13:28,831
You want me
to keep going?

216
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:32,001
Alright,
let's get the kids out first.

217
00:13:32,003 --> 00:13:34,746
Everybody, pack up.
We're going to Oceanside.

218
00:13:34,748 --> 00:13:38,007
Grab weapons, food...
whatever you can.

219
00:13:38,009 --> 00:13:40,527
We'll regroup there.

220
00:13:48,753 --> 00:13:49,870
Daryl...

221
00:13:49,872 --> 00:13:51,838
I wanna fight.

222
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,540
I know you do.
Don't argue.

223
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:54,857
RJ, come on.

224
00:13:57,179 --> 00:13:59,287
Come on.

225
00:14:42,073 --> 00:14:44,649
Felix and Penny.

226
00:14:46,153 --> 00:14:48,578
All the roads are gonna be
like this now.

227
00:14:51,007 --> 00:14:53,508
We ain't getting through.

228
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:54,843
It's Negan.

229
00:14:56,738 --> 00:14:58,730
He's with her now.

230
00:15:03,024 --> 00:15:04,894
Dad!

231
00:15:04,896 --> 00:15:07,114
Gracie?!

232
00:15:07,116 --> 00:15:09,599
Hey, hey.

233
00:15:14,014 --> 00:15:17,257
Go.
Go inside.

234
00:15:20,762 --> 00:15:22,854
What happened?

235
00:15:22,856 --> 00:15:24,430
She blocked
all the roads.

236
00:15:24,432 --> 00:15:26,266
Means they're closing in
on us.

237
00:15:26,268 --> 00:15:27,859
If we had a window to get out,
we just missed it.

238
00:15:27,861 --> 00:15:29,970
But we can't stay here.

239
00:15:29,972 --> 00:15:32,197
You said...

240
00:15:32,199 --> 00:15:37,144
you all said...
we can't stay here.

241
00:15:37,146 --> 00:15:39,204
We can... We can
call Alexandria, right?

242
00:15:39,206 --> 00:15:40,981
Call Alexandria,
and w...

243
00:15:40,983 --> 00:15:42,632
they'll get
fresh fighters here, right?

244
00:15:42,634 --> 00:15:45,210
And... And...
And it's not just gonna be us.

245
00:15:45,212 --> 00:15:47,212
It's not gonna be
just us, right?

246
00:15:47,214 --> 00:15:48,463
Oceanside can't get here.

247
00:15:48,465 --> 00:15:50,215
Alexandria, either.
Not in time.

248
00:15:50,217 --> 00:15:52,384
Not after
what happened.

249
00:15:52,386 --> 00:15:54,627
We're on our own.

250
00:15:54,629 --> 00:15:56,812
Divvy up
your arsenals.

251
00:15:56,814 --> 00:15:58,740
We got catapults
up on the walls.

252
00:15:58,742 --> 00:16:00,149
And a damn good militia.

253
00:16:01,653 --> 00:16:03,728
This is what you've all
been practicing for.

254
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:06,173
Come on, now, people!

255
00:16:06,175 --> 00:16:10,418
Do whatever you need
to get your heads on straight!

256
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:13,013
This is gonna be
the fight of our lives.

257
00:16:46,048 --> 00:16:48,773
Hey.

258
00:16:48,775 --> 00:16:50,467
Hey.

259
00:17:10,072 --> 00:17:12,697
It's nothing.

260
00:17:17,112 --> 00:17:19,579
Never bullshit
a bullshitter.

261
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,882
I wanted
to tell you.

262
00:18:22,552 --> 00:18:24,035
Hey.

263
00:18:24,037 --> 00:18:25,795
What do you think
you're doing?

264
00:18:25,797 --> 00:18:27,872
I'm going to say hello
to my nephew.

265
00:18:27,874 --> 00:18:29,124
Please.

266
00:18:29,126 --> 00:18:30,450
Alpha could come
in any second.

267
00:18:30,452 --> 00:18:32,118
And whose fault's that,
huh?

268
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,136
Hey.

269
00:18:34,138 --> 00:18:37,382
- I hate them, too.
- What's going on here?

270
00:18:37,384 --> 00:18:40,051
She's not supposed to be here.

271
00:18:40,053 --> 00:18:42,053
Alden...
she's not gonna hurt him.

272
00:18:42,055 --> 00:18:44,313
- Do you really wanna fight about this right now?
- Yeah, I do.

273
00:18:44,315 --> 00:18:48,059
Earl's a better father
than mine was.

274
00:18:48,061 --> 00:18:50,820
And we lost Tammy,
and then I lost...

275
00:18:50,822 --> 00:18:53,155
And he's been
raising that boy alone.

276
00:18:53,157 --> 00:18:54,490
For her.

277
00:18:54,492 --> 00:18:56,325
And for us.
Not for you. He's not yours.

278
00:18:56,327 --> 00:18:57,810
He'll never be.

279
00:18:57,812 --> 00:18:59,420
And you think
I'm picking a fight?

280
00:18:59,422 --> 00:19:00,922
Think I'm
being unreasonable?

281
00:19:00,924 --> 00:19:03,350
If I die tonight,
it'll have been for

282
00:19:03,352 --> 00:19:06,335
everything we've been trying
to build for him!

283
00:19:06,337 --> 00:19:07,937
Hey, buddy.

284
00:19:14,604 --> 00:19:16,771
That was fun.

285
00:19:16,773 --> 00:19:18,923
That was never
our problem.

286
00:19:18,925 --> 00:19:20,683
I'll take it.

287
00:19:20,685 --> 00:19:23,995
Remembered fondly
for something.

288
00:19:25,073 --> 00:19:27,207
Nothing?

289
00:19:27,209 --> 00:19:30,377
Not even
an eye roll?

290
00:19:33,865 --> 00:19:36,866
You've changed.

291
00:19:36,868 --> 00:19:40,353
Lost your
sense of humor.

292
00:19:40,355 --> 00:19:42,847
No, I haven't.

293
00:19:44,226 --> 00:19:47,635
I left it on a dresser
in the Kingdom,

294
00:19:47,637 --> 00:19:49,211
and then
it burned down.

295
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:52,624
Well, if it makes you feel
any better,

296
00:19:52,626 --> 00:19:54,901
I left my pride
sitting up there, too.

297
00:19:55,979 --> 00:19:58,154
I always hated
that stupid dresser, anyway.

298
00:20:11,736 --> 00:20:14,403
Would this
have happened if...

299
00:20:14,405 --> 00:20:16,648
it was
any other night?

300
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:18,675
What do you mean?

301
00:20:23,673 --> 00:20:26,433
If we didn't think
we were gonna die tonight.

302
00:20:28,161 --> 00:20:31,688
Wait.
We're gonna die tonight?

303
00:20:57,524 --> 00:20:58,948
Ooph.

304
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:01,951
I talked to Gabriel.

305
00:21:03,713 --> 00:21:06,714
Coco's fine.
I just...

306
00:21:06,716 --> 00:21:10,960
I worry about
how close Beta got to her.

307
00:21:14,316 --> 00:21:16,316
You tell him about
the horde?

308
00:21:16,318 --> 00:21:17,725
Hell, no.

309
00:21:17,727 --> 00:21:20,878
No, he'd...

310
00:21:23,325 --> 00:21:24,974
I'll tell him
when I see them again.

311
00:21:24,976 --> 00:21:27,552
Well, probability tilts
firmly towards our demise,

312
00:21:27,554 --> 00:21:30,622
- so, strictly speaking...
- Eugene.

313
00:21:31,983 --> 00:21:35,226
Thought I'd see you
up there,

314
00:21:35,228 --> 00:21:36,920
working on the radio.

315
00:21:38,231 --> 00:21:41,966
I ceased transmissions.

316
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:58,658
You like this girl,
huh?

317
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:02,529
Seems forgiveness of your
faux pas is not in her vocab,

318
00:22:02,531 --> 00:22:05,532
as such, which leaves me
with the unpleasant conclusion

319
00:22:05,534 --> 00:22:08,368
that she finds me unworthy
of her further attentions,

320
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:10,036
confirming what
I've already known

321
00:22:10,038 --> 00:22:11,779
and what's oft
been repeated to me.

322
00:22:11,781 --> 00:22:14,782
Who cares
what other people think?

323
00:22:17,379 --> 00:22:19,103
Eugene.

324
00:22:19,105 --> 00:22:23,032
How'd you know me this long
and you have no game?

325
00:22:23,034 --> 00:22:24,458
You been talking to that girl
on the radio

326
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:26,460
long enough for that room
to turn into a dump.

327
00:22:26,462 --> 00:22:29,280
She likes you.

328
00:22:36,398 --> 00:22:39,566
Do you wanna kiss me?

329
00:22:44,297 --> 00:22:46,573
Come on, kiss me.

330
00:22:46,575 --> 00:22:49,725
And hurry
before I change my damn mind.

331
00:23:16,605 --> 00:23:18,162
It's a special
kind of peculiar

332
00:23:18,164 --> 00:23:19,939
to hanker for a kiss
from someone you've never met,

333
00:23:19,941 --> 00:23:21,256
isn't it?

334
00:23:21,258 --> 00:23:24,760
Wow.

335
00:23:24,762 --> 00:23:27,338
I know.

336
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:28,856
This is not the time

337
00:23:28,858 --> 00:23:31,100
to be mulling matters
of a forlorn heart.

338
00:23:31,102 --> 00:23:32,619
Awesome.

339
00:23:32,621 --> 00:23:34,103
Well, that's what we'll put
on your gravestone.

340
00:23:34,105 --> 00:23:36,456
"Loser with
a forlorn heart."

341
00:23:41,354 --> 00:23:45,114
No, we can't give them
what they want.

342
00:23:45,116 --> 00:23:49,451
Those skin freaks would love
if we just rolled over.

343
00:23:49,453 --> 00:23:53,640
Screw that,
and screw them.

344
00:23:53,642 --> 00:23:56,717
Well,
you like this girl.

345
00:23:58,371 --> 00:24:00,888
So get off your ass
and go get her.

346
00:25:05,438 --> 00:25:07,964
You should hate me.

347
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,720
It's hard...

348
00:25:13,722 --> 00:25:17,640
when you seem
to hate yourself so much.

349
00:25:19,035 --> 00:25:21,519
I'm gonna kill her.

350
00:25:23,973 --> 00:25:26,566
That won't save us.

351
00:25:32,465 --> 00:25:35,199
But it'll feel good.

352
00:25:36,745 --> 00:25:39,579
Will you hate me then?

353
00:25:39,581 --> 00:25:42,656
I won't be
thinking about you.

354
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,589
Thanks.

355
00:25:49,591 --> 00:25:52,884
Thanks for
telling the truth.

356
00:26:00,251 --> 00:26:02,769
People don't know
how to do that anymore.

357
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:11,519
"I'm sorry your kid died
and you hate the world."

358
00:26:15,508 --> 00:26:18,025
"Sorry your mother
is a monster."

359
00:26:22,532 --> 00:26:29,796
So they stay away...

360
00:26:29,798 --> 00:26:32,523
and let you
feel lonely.

361
00:26:42,535 --> 00:26:46,370
I had a whole life.

362
00:26:49,818 --> 00:26:52,801
I remember.

363
00:27:24,853 --> 00:27:27,578
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

364
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:29,338
It's good. It's good. It's good.
It's good. It's good.

365
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:31,858
- Hey.
- Good.

366
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,342
I'm sorry.

367
00:27:33,344 --> 00:27:36,011
I'm an asshole...

368
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:42,835
We're gonna win this,

369
00:27:42,837 --> 00:27:46,264
and we're gonna
get them back here.

370
00:27:46,266 --> 00:27:49,508
'Cause assholes
get shit done.

371
00:27:57,627 --> 00:28:00,628
- Gross.
- What is that?

372
00:28:03,874 --> 00:28:05,341
Tell everyone
to gather up.

373
00:28:05,343 --> 00:28:08,019

Told you
to just sing it.

397

You got nice chops.

398
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:20,484
Singing chops,
that is.

399
00:30:21,921 --> 00:30:24,030
I'm sorry
for disappearing.

400
00:30:24,032 --> 00:30:26,090
I...
freaked a little bit.

401
00:30:26,092 --> 00:30:28,016
Onus falls
squarely on me.

402
00:30:28,018 --> 00:30:29,518
I-I let my guard down.

403
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,929
I apologize.

404
00:30:31,931 --> 00:30:33,764
So...

405
00:30:33,766 --> 00:30:37,768
who was the girl?

406
00:30:40,048 --> 00:30:44,291
Oh.
Oh, that's Rosita.

407
00:30:44,293 --> 00:30:48,295
I can
hear you smiling.

408
00:30:48,297 --> 00:30:52,058
You must be
fond of her.

409
00:30:53,953 --> 00:30:55,953
Why, yes.

410
00:30:55,955 --> 00:30:58,305
Very.

411
00:30:58,307 --> 00:31:03,552
She is
my proverbial BFF.

412
00:31:03,554 --> 00:31:07,073
And at the risk
of seeming forward,

413
00:31:07,075 --> 00:31:08,557
I sincerely hope

414
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:10,634
you will get the chance
to meet her someday.

415
00:31:12,805 --> 00:31:14,729
I hope so, too.

416
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,421
I don't know

417
00:31:22,423 --> 00:31:23,831
when the next time we'll be able
to heart-to-heart is,

418
00:31:23,833 --> 00:31:25,332
but I just wanted
to let you know

419
00:31:25,334 --> 00:31:27,927
that the last few days
have been incredible.

420
00:31:29,563 --> 00:31:30,763
Charleston,
West Virginia.

421
00:31:30,765 --> 00:31:32,247
Southern Rail yards.

422
00:31:32,249 --> 00:31:33,674
About a mile south
of the Kanawha River.

423
00:31:33,676 --> 00:31:34,992
One week.

424
00:31:34,994 --> 00:31:37,995
Can you be there?

425
00:31:37,997 --> 00:31:41,590
- Eugene? You there?
- Yes.

426
00:31:41,592 --> 00:31:43,500
I will be there...

427
00:31:43,502 --> 00:31:44,835
not square.

428
00:31:44,837 --> 00:31:48,355
This is Tater Bug,
over and out.

429
00:31:48,357 --> 00:31:50,116
Over and out.

430
00:31:52,678 --> 00:31:57,014
Eugene.
You ready or what?

431
00:31:58,609 --> 00:32:01,368
Let's get this
over with.

432
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:04,021
I got a date.

433
00:32:15,626 --> 00:32:18,627
Hi.

434
00:32:18,629 --> 00:32:21,780
Here we go.

435
00:32:25,352 --> 00:32:27,711
You okay?

436
00:32:27,713 --> 00:32:30,639
No.
I got cancer.

437
00:32:30,641 --> 00:32:33,050
But that's okay.

438
00:32:33,052 --> 00:32:34,459
You know
what I'm sayin'?

439
00:32:35,788 --> 00:32:37,979
Yeah.
I'm sorry about that.

440
00:32:40,409 --> 00:32:43,169
Look,
you and I, uh...

441
00:32:43,171 --> 00:32:46,914
we never really had much
to say to each other.

442
00:32:46,916 --> 00:32:48,657
But that doesn't mean
I don't know

443
00:32:48,659 --> 00:32:51,402
all the things
you've been through.

444
00:32:51,404 --> 00:32:53,571
You're stronger
than most,

445
00:32:53,573 --> 00:32:56,182
and there's
a whole lot of people here

446
00:32:56,184 --> 00:32:58,425
real glad about that.

447
00:32:58,427 --> 00:33:01,094
I am, too.

448
00:33:01,096 --> 00:33:03,914
Thanks, man.

449
00:33:03,916 --> 00:33:06,750
That means a lot.

450
00:33:06,752 --> 00:33:07,943
Yeah.

451
00:33:07,945 --> 00:33:10,437
Things are gonna get
real bad around here.

452
00:33:10,439 --> 00:33:13,607
I just want to know
that the kids are alright.

453
00:33:13,609 --> 00:33:18,204
If things go sideways,
or you or I go down...

454
00:33:18,206 --> 00:33:20,614
The other
gets the children out.

455
00:33:21,934 --> 00:33:23,450
You good with that?

456
00:33:29,458 --> 00:33:32,218
Alright.

457
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:45,289
Hi.

458
00:33:45,291 --> 00:33:48,809
You should be
with the other kids.

459
00:33:48,811 --> 00:33:50,310
I wanna help.

460
00:33:50,312 --> 00:33:51,795
I can fight.

461
00:33:51,797 --> 00:33:53,464
I know you can.

462
00:33:53,466 --> 00:33:55,132
I'm sorry about today.

463
00:33:55,134 --> 00:33:58,059
You didn't need to see
those bodies like that.

464
00:33:58,061 --> 00:33:59,653
They were just walkers.

465
00:33:59,655 --> 00:34:01,972
I've killed
plenty of walkers.

466
00:34:01,974 --> 00:34:03,249
I know.

467
00:34:03,251 --> 00:34:04,808
But they weren't
just walkers.

468
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:08,495
I'm not scared.

469
00:34:08,497 --> 00:34:10,648
I know you're not.

470
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:13,725
Maybe I am,
a little bit.

471
00:34:15,988 --> 00:34:19,156
If I was scared,

472
00:34:19,158 --> 00:34:22,917
maybe I'd be scared for RJ
because he's so little.

473
00:34:24,205 --> 00:34:25,754
Yeah.
I get that.

474
00:34:25,756 --> 00:34:28,515
Maybe I'd be worried
about my mom.

475
00:34:28,517 --> 00:34:31,351
Maybe I'd be scared
that you'd get hurt

476
00:34:31,353 --> 00:34:34,171
and I'd lose you.

477
00:34:34,173 --> 00:34:36,173
And Aunt Carol, too.

478
00:34:36,175 --> 00:34:39,084
There ain't no shame
in that.

479
00:34:39,086 --> 00:34:41,345
You know
who you're fighting for.

480
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:50,537
I made you something.

481
00:34:50,539 --> 00:34:52,464
It's for luck.

482
00:34:52,466 --> 00:34:53,782
No way.

483
00:34:53,784 --> 00:34:56,302
I love it.

484
00:34:58,306 --> 00:34:59,621
How do I look?

485
00:34:59,623 --> 00:35:01,289
It looks good.

486
00:35:03,794 --> 00:35:07,204
There's one other thing.

487
00:35:08,557 --> 00:35:10,040
If,
during the fight,

488
00:35:10,042 --> 00:35:12,801
Ezekiel comes looking
for you and RJ,

489
00:35:12,803 --> 00:35:14,211
you go with him,

490
00:35:14,213 --> 00:35:16,155
whether you know
where I am or not.

491
00:35:16,157 --> 00:35:18,048
Okay?

492
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:19,566
Hey.

493
00:35:19,568 --> 00:35:22,811
You gotta promise me.

494
00:35:24,573 --> 00:35:26,131
I promise.

495
00:36:35,127 --> 00:36:37,644
Now, please don't hate me.

496
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:52,551
I'm never
gonna hate you.

497
00:38:59,438 --> 00:39:02,673
Formation!

498
00:40:27,542 --> 00:40:29,117
They're splitting
into two!

499
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:31,528
They're gonna load up!

500
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:34,773
On my command,
splitting ranks!

501
00:40:34,775 --> 00:40:37,384
And... break!

502
00:41:59,284 --> 00:42:03,803
The fence
isn't gonna hold!

503
00:42:49,759 --> 00:42:52,519
Smells like
a Christmas tree!

504
00:43:05,184 --> 00:43:06,600
It's like gasoline!

505
00:43:22,976 --> 00:43:26,870
I thought you wanted them
to join us.

506
00:43:26,872 --> 00:43:29,964
They will.

507
00:43:29,966 --> 00:43:33,226
As part of my horde.

508
00:43:33,228 --> 00:43:35,636
Holy shit...

509
00:43:35,638 --> 00:43:38,139
you are a badass.

510
00:43:39,993 --> 00:43:43,053
Get ready
to fall back!

511
00:43:44,489 --> 00:43:47,315
Back inside!
Come on!

512
00:43:47,317 --> 00:43:49,317
Come on!
Retreat!

513
00:43:49,319 --> 00:43:51,911
Go, go, go!

514
00:43:51,913 --> 00:43:53,672
Come on! Go!

515
00:43:53,674 --> 00:43:55,415
Let's move!

516
00:44:04,226 --> 00:44:05,592
Come on!

517
00:44:05,594 --> 00:44:07,853
They're already dead!
Let's go!

518
00:44:13,159 --> 00:44:17,087
Back! Fall back!

519
00:44:17,089 --> 00:44:19,364
Let them break through!
Move!

520
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:54,124
