Do you know what
happened to her?

that we got people in here

But you want my help back
there, it's not for me.

823
00:50:12,745 --> 00:50:15,922
My daughter and my family
will always come first.

824
00:50:15,965 --> 00:50:17,489
There's sort of a line

825
00:50:17,532 --> 00:50:20,100
for how far she's gonna
go for the Commonwealth.

826
00:50:20,144 --> 00:50:23,277
When Daryl and Maggie are
on a mission together,

827
00:50:23,321 --> 00:50:25,801
they're really great as a team.

828
00:50:25,845 --> 00:50:27,716
They have such a
long relationship,

829
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:29,849
and both of them
are really tough,

830
00:50:29,892 --> 00:50:31,292
they are leaders
in their own right.

831
00:50:31,329 --> 00:50:35,420
But I think that
Daryl really feels

832
00:50:35,463 --> 00:50:38,553
like he still owes
this debt to Maggie

833
00:50:38,597 --> 00:50:40,207
because of what
happened to Glenn.

834
00:50:40,251 --> 00:50:42,427
He blames himself still.

835
00:50:42,470 --> 00:50:45,865
Glenn would have wanted
me to look out for you.

836
00:50:45,908 --> 00:50:49,521
You don't have to ever
say "sorry"... not to me.

So much of the world is
so broken at this point,

839
00:50:54,091 --> 00:50:57,268
our characters...
They don't have

840
00:50:57,311 --> 00:50:59,835
a lot of trust in the
Commonwealth in general,

841
00:50:59,879 --> 00:51:02,011
but especially
not at this point.

842
00:51:02,055 --> 00:51:03,622
Hope is running low.

843
00:51:03,665 --> 00:51:05,426
And the longer we're out
here having these debates,

844
00:51:05,450 --> 00:51:07,167
the more our families
back home are at risk.

845
00:51:07,191 --> 00:51:08,627
Our people are out here, too.

846
00:51:08,670 --> 00:51:10,846
We need to find
Hornsby and kill him

847
