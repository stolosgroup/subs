00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:42,018
but applying that faith in a
very particular direction.

702
00:45:42,061 --> 00:45:44,890
And, like, what does that mean
for Gabriel.

703
00:45:44,934 --> 00:45:49,329
In a previous episode,
he saw this minister out there

704
00:45:49,373 --> 00:45:53,681
and hesitated to kill him when
he saw that this person seemed

705
00:45:53,725 --> 00:45:56,162
to be having
a conversation with God.

706
00:45:56,206 --> 00:45:57,947
And it's frustrating for him.

707
00:45:57,990 --> 00:45:59,600
How could God speak to you?!

708
00:45:59,644 --> 00:46:03,735
My role is not the question,
I listen and serve,

709
00:46:03,779 --> 00:46:05,606
But we see,
at the end of the day,

710
00:46:05,650 --> 00:46:09,610
when he's up against this person
he doesn't trust them,

711
00:46:09,654 --> 00:46:13,005
he thinks that person's
faith is built on lies.

712
00:46:13,049 --> 00:46:15,921
And so, he takes him out for the
good of his group.

713
00:46:15,965 --> 00:46:17,923
No one is above saving.

714
00:46:21,187 --> 00:46:23,233
I don't believe that.

715
00:46:23,668 --> 00:46:26,410
Aah.

716
00:46:26,453 --> 00:46:29,761
It is definitely hard to put
children in grave danger.

717
00:46:29,805 --> 00:46:32,285
We obviously have to be really
careful about, like,

718
00:46:32,329 --> 00:46:35,071
making sure that it's safe for
the kids.

719
00:46:35,114 --> 00:46:37,725
So, the tank is, like, very,
very controlled.

720
00:46:37,769 --> 00:46:39,815
That whole basement sits inside
a tank.

721
00:46:39,858 --> 00:46:42,861
There's like a steel cage,
basically, surrounding it,

722
00:46:42,905 --> 00:46:44,515
like, that fills with water.

723
00:46:44,558 --> 00:46:47,344
The water is heated so they're
not even cold, like,

724
00:46:47,387 --> 00:46:49,041
it's very, very balmy
and, like, being in,

725
00:46:49,085 --> 00:46:51,696
like, a warm bath, I think.

726
00:46:51,739 --> 00:46:54,481
And the, you know, obviously
story-wise I think we want to

727
00:46:54,525 --> 00:46:58,877
be mindful of not going, like,
too far with anything

728
00:46:58,921 --> 00:47:00,879
with kids,
but at the same time,

729
00:47:00,923 --> 00:47:03,055
Judith is a really strong
character.

730
00:47:04,665 --> 00:47:06,232
I think you can really tell
Judith is

731
00:47:06,276 --> 00:47:07,755
Rick and Michonne's daughter.

732
00:47:07,799 --> 00:47:10,889
Just in the way that she kinda
keeps her head

733
00:47:10,933 --> 00:47:13,283
in the middle of a pretty
intense situation.

734
00:47:13,326 --> 00:47:17,069
She has this calmness that
washes over her

735
00:47:17,113 --> 00:47:20,029
exterior presentation so that
you can really see

736
00:47:20,072 --> 00:47:22,945
the leadership qualities that
both Rick and Michonne had,

737
00:47:22,988 --> 00:47:24,381
like coming out in her.

738
00:47:24,424 --> 00:47:26,209
She's really quite strong.

739
00:47:27,906 --> 00:47:31,388
Alden's death for Maggie is
actually very devastating.

740
00:47:31,431 --> 00:47:33,869
For people who've been watching
the show for a long time,

741
00:47:33,912 --> 00:47:37,176
like, you can remember back to
when Maggie and Alden

742
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:38,482
first kind of met.

743
00:47:38,525 --> 00:47:40,440
And Alden was a Savior.

744
00:47:40,484 --> 00:47:44,618
And he really was one of the
first Saviors to kind of say

745
00:47:44,662 --> 00:47:46,620
"I'm throwing in my lot with
you.

746
00:47:46,664 --> 00:47:48,448
I believe in
what you're trying to do

747
00:47:48,492 --> 00:47:49,928
and I'm gonna help you
build it."

748
00:47:49,972 --> 00:47:51,930
Okay.

749
00:47:51,974 --> 00:47:57,022
And this character really was a
loyal friend to Maggie.

750
00:47:57,066 --> 00:47:58,981
So I think, like,
really the whole thing

751
00:47:59,024 --> 00:48:01,679
is pretty awful for her,
'cause I think she feels like

752
00:48:01,722 --> 00:48:03,724
I asked people to
come out on this mission

753
00:48:03,768 --> 00:48:06,814
and here's the price,
here's the cost that was paid,

754
00:48:06,858 --> 00:48:08,294
the sacrifice.

755
00:48:08,338 --> 00:48:10,644
And I think also,
it's crushing to her to feel

756
00:48:10,688 --> 00:48:12,820
like he had a bad ending.

757
00:48:12,864 --> 00:48:16,737
He suffered as a Walker before
she came to get him again.

758
00:48:16,781 --> 00:48:18,652
And I think that that's
really hard for her.

759
00:48:18,696 --> 00:48:24,702
♪

760
00:48:24,745 --> 00:48:27,444
You were always gonna do
what you did, Maggie.

761
00:48:28,836 --> 00:48:31,665
Maggie and Negan, you know,
they really start off,

762
00:48:31,709 --> 00:48:35,147
like, heavily at odds at the
beginning of the season.

763
00:48:35,191 --> 00:48:38,368
But over time, you know, they've
been forced to work together.

764
00:48:38,411 --> 00:48:40,892
They'd often disagree on
tactics.

765
00:48:40,936 --> 00:48:43,895
But I think they're both strong
leaders.

766
00:48:43,939 --> 00:48:45,984
Obviously Negan's
form of leadership

767
00:48:46,028 --> 00:48:49,770
was not always positive, but
Maggie has also been through

768
00:48:49,814 --> 00:48:53,165
a lot and has had to make some
dark decisions of her own

769
00:48:53,209 --> 00:48:56,734
so I think, really, like,
at this point in the story

770
00:48:56,777 --> 00:49:01,130
they're seeing elements of their
own decision-making

771
00:49:01,173 --> 00:49:03,523
in the other and it, like,
definitely for Maggie,

772
00:49:03,567 --> 00:49:07,223
that's a unsettling feeling
and an unsettling idea.

773
00:49:07,266 --> 00:49:09,573
'Cause she wants nothing to do
with Negan.

774
00:49:09,616 --> 00:49:12,010
And yet, you know,
she makes this decision

775
00:49:12,054 --> 00:49:14,143
in this episode to basically
kill them all.

776
00:49:18,147 --> 00:49:21,280
That puts her in kind of this
really dark place

777
00:49:21,324 --> 00:49:24,196
an emotional place where
she felt like she did

778
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:25,676
what had to be done.

779
00:49:25,719 --> 00:49:27,199
And, yet,
it leaves her unsettled

780
00:49:27,243 --> 00:49:28,809
about the whole thing.

781
00:49:28,853 --> 00:49:33,031
And I think from Negan's side,
he's looking at a mirror

782
00:49:33,075 --> 00:49:36,948
of himself and going,
this is unsettling for me, too.

783
00:49:36,992 --> 00:49:40,560
I think he realizes the way that
he led, in some ways,

784
00:49:40,604 --> 00:49:44,303
caused a lot of unease and was
not the positive way of bringing

785
00:49:44,347 --> 00:49:47,002
people into his organization,
like he maybe thought it was.

786
00:49:47,045 --> 00:49:48,612
And so I think both characters
are doing

787
00:49:48,655 --> 00:49:50,701
a lot of soul searching
at this point.

788
00:49:52,094 --> 00:49:54,313
I'm going to be on my own way.

789
00:49:57,055 --> 00:50:00,885
We really wanted to show that
our people at this point,

790
00:50:00,928 --> 00:50:04,280
they're being hit by thing after
thing after thing.

791
00:50:04,323 --> 00:50:06,456
Even the weather
is against them.

792
00:50:06,499 --> 00:50:09,502
One of my favorite moments,
in that montage,

793
00:50:09,546 --> 00:50:13,811
after they've come home
is when Jerry's up on the wall

794
00:50:13,854 --> 00:50:15,987
and he's shouting like
something's coming.

795
00:50:16,031 --> 00:50:18,468
Hey!
Got something coming!

796
00:50:18,511 --> 00:50:21,558
And there's just this tiny
moment where Father Gabriel

797
00:50:21,601 --> 00:50:24,952
just puts his head back, like,
can we just catch a break

798
00:50:24,996 --> 00:50:26,867
for, like, two seconds,
you know.

799
00:50:26,911 --> 00:50:28,869
The world is pushing against
them at all times.

800
00:50:30,088 --> 00:50:32,264
We're all friends,
they're here to help.

801
00:50:33,178 --> 00:50:35,659
Our characters
and Lance Hornsby,

802
00:50:35,702 --> 00:50:39,489
they see this guy and he rolls
up and he's wearing this suit.

803
00:50:39,532 --> 00:50:42,970
And he's got, like,
this slick hair

804
00:50:43,014 --> 00:50:44,755
and, like, a big smile.

805
00:50:44,798 --> 00:50:47,845
And they're just looking at him
and going, like, what is this?

806
00:50:47,888 --> 00:50:50,195
Like, who are we looking at,
you know.

807
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:53,285
Our people at this point,
they're not very trusting

808
00:50:53,329 --> 00:50:55,461
of strangers, in general.

809
00:50:55,505 --> 00:50:57,898
So they kinda look at the guy
and go, like,

810
00:50:57,942 --> 00:51:00,379
I don't know about you,
in the suit.

811
00:51:00,423 --> 00:51:04,340
But at the same time, like,
he's making a really nice offer

812
00:51:04,383 --> 00:51:05,906
and they're really in trouble.

813
00:51:05,950 --> 00:51:08,648
Their place had just been
trashed by the storm

814
00:51:08,692 --> 00:51:10,781
and all the difficulties they've
been facing

815
00:51:10,824 --> 00:51:12,652
because of the Whisperers
aftermath.

816
00:51:12,696 --> 00:51:16,482
And lack of food and everything
that goes with it.

817
00:51:16,526 --> 00:51:19,703
We thought it'd be interesting
at the end of this episode

818
00:51:19,746 --> 00:51:22,836
to do, like, just a deep
flash forward.

819
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:27,276
And we had been thinking for
awhile that Maggie was going to

820
00:51:27,319 --> 00:51:30,975
stay at the Hilltop and that
Daryl was gonna go to

821
00:51:31,018 --> 00:51:33,238
the Commonwealth and eventually
become a trooper.

822
00:51:33,282 --> 00:51:36,241
And the, we're like, well, I
mean, like, you could show them

823
00:51:36,285 --> 00:51:38,809
at, like, this point of conflict
way down the line

824
00:51:38,852 --> 00:51:40,985
so that we wonder, like,
what has happened

825
00:51:41,028 --> 00:51:42,465
in the intervene time.

826
00:51:42,508 --> 00:51:44,728
Doesn't have to be this way.

827
00:51:44,771 --> 00:51:46,817
Yeah it does.
