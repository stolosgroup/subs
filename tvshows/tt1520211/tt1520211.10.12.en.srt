1
00:00:00,135 --> 00:00:01,191
He's my nephew.

2
00:00:01,193 --> 00:00:02,736
I just wanna know
that the kids are alright.

3
00:00:02,738 --> 00:00:03,811
You or I go down...

4
00:00:03,813 --> 00:00:05,104
The other
gets the children out.

5
00:00:06,457 --> 00:00:07,898
I wanna help.

6
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:09,750
I can fight.
I'm not scared.

7
00:00:09,752 --> 00:00:11,785
I know you're not.
Maybe I am.

8
00:00:16,525 --> 00:00:17,380
Retreat!

9
00:00:17,382 --> 00:00:18,364
Back inside!

11
00:00:50,943 --> 00:00:52,593
We gotta jam 'em up.

12
00:01:15,009 --> 00:01:16,450
Come on!
Move it!

13
00:01:17,353 --> 00:01:20,346
Take that, you bastards!

14
00:01:48,651 --> 00:01:51,301
It's workin'.
They're slowin' down.

15
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:05,166
Lydia!

16
00:02:05,168 --> 00:02:06,892
Hey, you can't
go back out there!

17
00:02:06,894 --> 00:02:08,502
You know
what Alpha wants.

18
00:02:08,504 --> 00:02:10,338
I'll never
walk with her.

19
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,340
Over there!
Over there!

20
00:02:14,177 --> 00:02:16,844
Stay with me,
everybody!

21
00:02:17,905 --> 00:02:19,180
It's all right!

22
00:02:19,182 --> 00:02:21,331
It's gonna be fine!
Wait, wait, wait!

23
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:26,169
Where's Judith?

24
00:02:35,198 --> 00:02:38,849
Aah! Please.
Please...

25
00:02:38,851 --> 00:02:42,328
Please...

26
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,525
Okay, Judith.
Okay, okay.

27
00:02:48,527 --> 00:02:51,103
Let's get to
a safe place.

28
00:02:59,296 --> 00:03:01,538
Hold the line!

29
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,949
Hold them back!
Hold them back!

30
00:03:03,951 --> 00:03:05,226
Steady!

31
00:03:13,936 --> 00:03:17,479
Eugene!

32
00:03:48,179 --> 00:03:50,604
Fire!

33
00:03:52,275 --> 00:03:54,275
Back!

34
00:03:54,277 --> 00:03:56,402
Wall's down. Follow me.

36
00:06:34,345 --> 00:06:36,312
Through the heart.

37
00:06:37,422 --> 00:06:39,331
Aw, shit.

38
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:40,924
My bad.

39
00:06:40,926 --> 00:06:44,019
Do not miss again.

40
00:06:44,021 --> 00:06:47,472
Many Guardians
were sacrificed.

41
00:06:48,451 --> 00:06:51,176
We must gather.
Replenish.

42
00:06:51,178 --> 00:06:52,936
Well,
I really need

43
00:06:52,938 --> 00:06:56,457
to show you all
how to savor a victory.

44
00:06:56,459 --> 00:06:58,483
It is not a victory

45
00:06:58,485 --> 00:07:02,087
if I do not have
everything I want.

46
00:07:08,712 --> 00:07:11,138
Lydia.

47
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,455
Not your concern.

48
00:07:12,457 --> 00:07:14,049
Then you have seen her?

49
00:07:14,051 --> 00:07:16,201
She's not
amongst the dead.

50
00:07:16,203 --> 00:07:18,512
But I will not stop
until I bring her home.

51
00:07:18,514 --> 00:07:19,897
To you.

52
00:07:31,309 --> 00:07:35,871
I am at your service,
Frowny McTwoKnives.

53
00:07:36,982 --> 00:07:38,499
Gather.

54
00:07:38,501 --> 00:07:40,559
Wait, wait, wait.

55
00:07:40,561 --> 00:07:43,796
You want me
to herd walkers?

56
00:07:49,512 --> 00:07:52,421
Such a dick.

57
00:08:33,556 --> 00:08:36,206
Screw this.

58
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:49,795
Aw.

59
00:09:29,503 --> 00:09:33,429
All right, Aaron, hold...
hold on one second.

60
00:09:33,431 --> 00:09:35,908
I said hold on,
dammit!

61
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:38,527
Don't go
and do something stupid.

62
00:09:38,529 --> 00:09:42,014
The only stupid thing
would be to not kill you.

63
00:09:42,016 --> 00:09:43,849
No, look,
I can explain. Just...

64
00:09:43,851 --> 00:09:45,292
Shut up.

65
00:09:46,854 --> 00:09:48,278
Aaron, I am not...

66
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:51,690
Enough of your bullshit!

67
00:10:29,206 --> 00:10:30,561
Stop.

68
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:32,328
Sorry, kid.

69
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:33,841
This shit is done.

70
00:10:41,314 --> 00:10:43,236
Hey,
let me take Adam.

71
00:10:43,238 --> 00:10:44,333
- It's all right.
- You need to...

72
00:10:44,335 --> 00:10:46,186
- No, hey, I'm fine.
- You need to rest.

73
00:10:46,188 --> 00:10:48,263
It's okay.
We just gotta keep moving.

74
00:10:48,265 --> 00:10:51,507
Earl and the others could be
at the rendezvous already.

75
00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:54,677
Hey,
it's okay.

76
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:56,271
We're almost there.

77
00:10:56,273 --> 00:10:59,015
Yes, we are.
Oh, yes, we are.

78
00:10:59,017 --> 00:11:01,034
Why don't you should try
talking normal?

79
00:11:01,036 --> 00:11:03,278
Oh, I am talking normal.
Aren't I?

80
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,038
I'm talking normal.

81
00:11:06,709 --> 00:11:10,043
That's the creepy baby voice,
Alden.

82
00:11:10,045 --> 00:11:13,605
Nobody likes
the creepy baby voice.

83
00:11:13,607 --> 00:11:15,274
Not even babies.

84
00:11:15,276 --> 00:11:17,943
Let me see
if I can help.

85
00:11:17,945 --> 00:11:20,036
Thought I told you
to stay back.

86
00:11:20,038 --> 00:11:22,297
I can help with Adam.

87
00:11:22,299 --> 00:11:23,798
Yeah,
the hell you can.

88
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,134
Come on.
She knows him.

89
00:11:26,136 --> 00:11:28,011
No,
she knew him.

90
00:11:28,013 --> 00:11:30,898
And her and her people
left him to die, remember?

91
00:11:32,643 --> 00:11:33,901
Shh, shh.

92
00:11:33,903 --> 00:11:35,460
It's enough
that I let her come along.

93
00:11:35,462 --> 00:11:37,070
There's no way she's getting
her hands on this kid.

94
00:11:37,072 --> 00:11:38,488
Move away...
now.

95
00:11:41,726 --> 00:11:43,969
Just try rubbing
the back of his head...

96
00:11:43,971 --> 00:11:46,046
I thought I told you
to be quiet!

97
00:11:46,048 --> 00:11:47,806
Just try rubbing
the back of his head

98
00:11:47,808 --> 00:11:49,474
very gently
and very slowly.

99
00:11:49,476 --> 00:11:51,810
And keep making shushing noises
right into his ear,

100
00:11:51,812 --> 00:11:53,086
over and over.

101
00:11:54,831 --> 00:11:57,591
Shh.
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

102
00:12:01,171 --> 00:12:03,838
Let me try.

103
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:05,158
What was her name?

104
00:13:06,403 --> 00:13:08,053
Your sister.

105
00:13:08,055 --> 00:13:09,963
You never said.

106
00:13:12,893 --> 00:13:15,894
Frances.

107
00:13:15,896 --> 00:13:19,398
Her name was Frances.

108
00:13:20,834 --> 00:13:25,661
And he meant everything
to her.

109
00:13:25,663 --> 00:13:30,075
And she was everything
to you, right?

110
00:13:38,027 --> 00:13:41,436
If I had to do it
all over again...

111
00:13:46,443 --> 00:13:51,020
She should be the one sitting
here holding him, not me.

112
00:14:07,205 --> 00:14:09,705
Let's move.

113
00:14:09,707 --> 00:14:11,466
What's going on?

114
00:14:11,468 --> 00:14:13,860
They're coming.

115
00:14:27,892 --> 00:14:31,152
Follow me! Follow me!
Come on!

116
00:14:36,326 --> 00:14:38,051
Come on!

117
00:15:04,746 --> 00:15:07,914
No! No!

118
00:15:14,772 --> 00:15:17,349
Come on!

119
00:15:19,444 --> 00:15:22,653
Hey! Over here!

120
00:15:24,191 --> 00:15:26,933
Come on!

121
00:16:03,063 --> 00:16:04,896
Unh!

122
00:16:13,315 --> 00:16:17,592
You. Will. Walk.

123
00:16:17,594 --> 00:16:20,428
With. Us.

124
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,324
Never!

125
00:17:01,063 --> 00:17:04,397
It's... It's you.

126
00:17:11,648 --> 00:17:14,374
Shh.

127
00:17:14,376 --> 00:17:16,876
Your voice
sounded familiar, but...

128
00:17:16,878 --> 00:17:19,204
Unh!

129
00:19:01,036 --> 00:19:03,499
Connect the circuit board
to the transponder.

130
00:19:03,501 --> 00:19:04,851
No, no, no.

131
00:19:04,853 --> 00:19:07,745
TNC antenna connection...

132
00:19:13,753 --> 00:19:16,196
We killed the skins.

133
00:19:16,198 --> 00:19:19,348
Then we crawled
back into the cave.

134
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:23,519
The sickos
were either dead or...

135
00:19:23,521 --> 00:19:26,188
trapped under rocks
from the...

136
00:19:37,886 --> 00:19:40,870
We kept pushing.

137
00:19:40,872 --> 00:19:42,889
Searching.

138
00:19:44,467 --> 00:19:45,892
Took a turn,

139
00:19:45,894 --> 00:19:52,290
and before we knew it,
we were in the horde.

140
00:19:52,292 --> 00:19:55,902
Connie and I
moved together.

141
00:19:55,904 --> 00:19:59,406
The sickos
pushed forward.

142
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:04,560
Got between us.

143
00:20:08,158 --> 00:20:10,417
And her hand...

144
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,736
...her hand just...

145
00:20:13,738 --> 00:20:15,738
slipped out of mine...

146
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:19,408
And I...

147
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:21,577
couldn't find her again.

148
00:20:26,509 --> 00:20:28,184
You're leaving?

149
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:33,106
Just wanna get there
before dark.

150
00:20:33,108 --> 00:20:36,184
You know,
she's been through a lot.

151
00:20:36,186 --> 00:20:39,028
Might need some more time
to rest.

152
00:20:40,173 --> 00:20:43,007
Stay as long
as you like.

153
00:20:43,009 --> 00:20:46,194
So you're just gonna
leave her behind?

154
00:20:46,196 --> 00:20:47,954
Again?

155
00:20:47,956 --> 00:20:50,198
I didn't say that.

156
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,025
You know,
maybe instead of ignoring her,

157
00:20:53,027 --> 00:20:55,628
you try begging
for forgiveness

158
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:58,548
after the shit
you put her through.

159
00:20:59,968 --> 00:21:03,011
You think
that's what she wants from me?

160
00:21:04,864 --> 00:21:07,865
Like it'll fix anything?

161
00:21:07,867 --> 00:21:11,277
We go through shit
to go through shit...

162
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:12,937
Unh!

163
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,885
What the hell
is wrong with her?

164
00:21:27,887 --> 00:21:29,996
I didn't ask you
to do that.

165
00:21:29,998 --> 00:21:31,989
You're saying
I should've just

166
00:21:31,991 --> 00:21:33,474
- let her treat you like that?
- I'm saying... I'm say...

167
00:21:33,476 --> 00:21:35,243
Well,
I am so, so sorry

168
00:21:35,245 --> 00:21:37,987
if I'm just not gonna sit here
and take that.

169
00:21:37,989 --> 00:21:41,065
Things don't always
work out the way you want, Miko.

170
00:21:41,067 --> 00:21:43,468
I never said they did!

171
00:21:45,514 --> 00:21:48,473
I can't
do this anymore.

172
00:21:56,191 --> 00:22:02,086
I thought a lot about
last time we talked.

173
00:22:02,088 --> 00:22:04,922
And I was so pissed.

174
00:22:07,427 --> 00:22:09,927
But now I get it.

175
00:22:09,929 --> 00:22:13,765
You were right
to kick me out.

176
00:22:15,693 --> 00:22:18,253
At least
I don't have to worry about

177
00:22:18,255 --> 00:22:20,938
someone stealing my pillow
no more.

178
00:22:22,292 --> 00:22:24,292
Well,
all I'll say is,

179
00:22:24,294 --> 00:22:26,535
the nights have been
a lot more peaceful.

180
00:22:26,537 --> 00:22:28,446
I don't snore.

181
00:22:28,448 --> 00:22:30,056
Yeah, right.

182
00:23:33,863 --> 00:23:37,373
I, uh...

183
00:23:39,018 --> 00:23:40,275
I didn't mean
to intrude,

184
00:23:40,277 --> 00:23:42,036
but I felt it
incumbent upon my person

185
00:23:42,038 --> 00:23:43,537
to give you
a once-over

186
00:23:43,539 --> 00:23:45,539
after seeing you take
a cherry cheesecake like that

187
00:23:45,541 --> 00:23:47,467
to the kisser.

188
00:23:48,786 --> 00:23:50,786
Do you know
what it feels like

189
00:23:50,788 --> 00:23:53,288
to want something
so bad...

190
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:57,393
and to go after it
with everything that you have...

191
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:03,207
...piss off everyone...
literally everyone...

192
00:24:03,209 --> 00:24:05,559
maybe get people killed...

193
00:24:05,561 --> 00:24:09,405
and still,
you have nothing to show for it?

194
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:12,950
I do.

195
00:24:31,921 --> 00:24:37,183
You see, there's a meetin'
of extraordinarily...

196
00:24:37,185 --> 00:24:40,077
momentous,
do-or-die,

197
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:42,337
Brobdingnagian proportions.

198
00:24:42,339 --> 00:24:45,174
- It's the...
- It's a big meeting.

199
00:24:45,176 --> 00:24:49,086
It's the biggest meeting
of my life.

200
00:24:49,088 --> 00:24:52,514
And it's coming up quick
on the calendar,

201
00:24:52,516 --> 00:24:55,943
and unfortunately,
I can't share details.

202
00:24:55,945 --> 00:24:58,095
But now,
with the grimness at hand,

203
00:24:58,097 --> 00:24:59,764
vis-a-vis Hilltop,

204
00:24:59,766 --> 00:25:03,267
I obviously can no longer attend
said meeting.

205
00:25:05,863 --> 00:25:08,681
It's just not often
you meet someone you...

206
00:25:13,463 --> 00:25:16,447
Another someone,
in general, I mean.

207
00:25:16,449 --> 00:25:19,875
If it's important,
it's simple.

208
00:25:19,877 --> 00:25:21,452
You go.

209
00:25:21,454 --> 00:25:23,879
Well, sure,
but I also have obli...

210
00:25:23,881 --> 00:25:27,024
Eugene,
just go to her.

211
00:25:37,612 --> 00:25:41,396
I sincerely hope you get
what it is that you want.

212
00:26:36,453 --> 00:26:38,712
Nabila's been asking
about her kids.

213
00:26:38,714 --> 00:26:40,473
You sure
Ezekiel has them?

214
00:26:40,475 --> 00:26:43,200
They should be
at the rendezvous.

215
00:26:48,483 --> 00:26:50,483
It feels like
it's still burning.

216
00:26:50,485 --> 00:26:52,209
We're almost there,
baby.

217
00:26:52,211 --> 00:26:54,728
Almost there.

218
00:27:24,577 --> 00:27:26,819
This is the spot,
right?

219
00:27:26,821 --> 00:27:28,170
Yeah.

220
00:27:28,172 --> 00:27:30,339
My babies?
Where are my babies?!

221
00:27:30,341 --> 00:27:32,016
Where are my babies?

222
00:27:32,018 --> 00:27:33,860
No.
Where are my babies?

223
00:27:33,862 --> 00:27:35,769
Nabila, they're with Ezekiel,
all right?

224
00:27:35,771 --> 00:27:37,329
They're with the king, they're with the king.

225
00:27:39,016 --> 00:27:41,683
Come on,
spread out.

226
00:27:41,685 --> 00:27:43,703
Come on, let's go.

227
00:27:43,705 --> 00:27:47,022
I'm gonna find them.
I'm gonna find them.

228
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:55,506
Earl,
think we'll be safe here?

229
00:27:57,793 --> 00:28:00,386
Did they see us?

230
00:28:00,388 --> 00:28:02,388
No, we're safe.

231
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:06,041
I won't let anything
happen to you.

232
00:28:06,043 --> 00:28:08,802
Do you think
Ezekiel's okay?

233
00:28:08,804 --> 00:28:12,565
There was just so much smoke,
and I couldn't see,

234
00:28:12,567 --> 00:28:14,734
and then
he was just gone.

235
00:28:14,736 --> 00:28:16,569
He'll be here,
honey.

236
00:28:16,571 --> 00:28:17,886
He will.

237
00:28:17,888 --> 00:28:20,555
He's one of the bravest men
I know.

238
00:28:20,557 --> 00:28:23,492
Okay?

239
00:28:24,637 --> 00:28:26,820
Wow.

240
00:28:26,822 --> 00:28:32,418
You are all
doing great.

241
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:37,314
You all are so good.

242
00:28:37,316 --> 00:28:39,316
You're so good.

243
00:28:39,318 --> 00:28:44,897
Your folks are gonna be so proud
when they get here.

244
00:28:44,899 --> 00:28:48,325
- So proud when they get here.
- Soon?

245
00:28:48,327 --> 00:28:50,844
Oh, yeah.

246
00:28:50,846 --> 00:28:53,606
Soon.
Real soon, sweetheart.

247
00:28:58,854 --> 00:29:01,763
Okay, now.

248
00:29:01,765 --> 00:29:03,491
Shh.

249
00:30:13,154 --> 00:30:16,414
You lied to us.

250
00:30:21,495 --> 00:30:23,921
I did.

251
00:30:25,424 --> 00:30:28,108
But I did it
to protect you.

252
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:30,852
You can't do this.

253
00:30:30,854 --> 00:30:34,540
I don't have
much choice.

254
00:30:34,542 --> 00:30:37,117
I can stay here
with you.

255
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:39,953
So you're not alone
when it happens.

256
00:30:39,955 --> 00:30:43,716
Oh, honey,
I'm not alone.

257
00:30:43,718 --> 00:30:46,535
I have Tammy
and my son.

258
00:30:49,724 --> 00:30:52,357
Alden will take
good care of Adam.

259
00:30:52,359 --> 00:30:56,970
And you, Judith...

260
00:30:56,972 --> 00:31:00,215
you're so strong.

261
00:31:00,217 --> 00:31:03,460
You're so brave.

262
00:31:06,574 --> 00:31:08,741
But now I need you

263
00:31:08,743 --> 00:31:11,877
to keep those kids safe
from me.

264
00:31:11,879 --> 00:31:14,229
Please.

265
00:31:14,231 --> 00:31:18,584
Go back out there,

266
00:31:18,586 --> 00:31:22,162
and don't come near me again,
okay?

267
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:25,042
Jerry.

268
00:32:25,044 --> 00:32:27,060
The kids...

269
00:32:27,062 --> 00:32:29,880
Earl's got the kids!

270
00:34:13,952 --> 00:34:16,411
Daryl!

271
00:34:16,413 --> 00:34:18,338
Hey, hi.

272
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:20,582
Daddy!

273
00:34:20,584 --> 00:34:22,493
Hi, buddy.

274
00:34:25,723 --> 00:34:28,181
Is Judith in there?

275
00:34:36,108 --> 00:34:39,100
Judith?

276
00:35:10,467 --> 00:35:13,134
Come here.

277
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,643
Alpha.

278
00:35:44,076 --> 00:35:47,186
That thing
you've been looking for...?

279
00:35:47,188 --> 00:35:49,488
I found it.

280
00:36:10,119 --> 00:36:12,786
It is beautiful.

281
00:36:15,031 --> 00:36:17,365
Pure.

282
00:36:17,367 --> 00:36:19,218
All I see
is a bag of bones

283
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:22,221
and some
gnarly-ass teeth.

284
00:36:22,223 --> 00:36:24,205
You will see.

285
00:36:24,207 --> 00:36:25,874
Maybe soon.

286
00:36:25,876 --> 00:36:28,710
And I will
meet you there.

287
00:36:30,472 --> 00:36:33,123
You know, I ain't exactly ready
to meet my Maker,

288
00:36:33,125 --> 00:36:35,959
if that's
what you're saying.

289
00:36:38,981 --> 00:36:43,558
You proved yourself again
by finding her.

290
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:49,081
And like the young lion cub
who must leave his pride,

291
00:36:49,083 --> 00:36:52,643
it is time
to roam the Earth.

292
00:36:52,645 --> 00:36:54,661
Build a new pride.

293
00:36:54,663 --> 00:36:58,482
Do you want me out there,
preaching your gospel?

294
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:05,172
I want you
to become a lion.

295
00:37:11,254 --> 00:37:13,439
You know,
I may not be hip

296
00:37:13,441 --> 00:37:15,849
on the whole
Greek alphabet,

297
00:37:15,851 --> 00:37:18,168
but Beta is no Alpha.

298
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:22,263
And if we're going stick
with the whole lion thing...

299
00:37:22,265 --> 00:37:24,933
then isn't it
the young lioness

300
00:37:24,935 --> 00:37:27,252
who takes
her mother's place?

301
00:37:28,622 --> 00:37:31,105
Walk.

302
00:37:37,856 --> 00:37:40,373
A long time ago,

303
00:37:40,375 --> 00:37:44,953
before meat-lovers like him
started showing up, I, uh...

304
00:37:44,955 --> 00:37:49,533
I lost somebody
that was close to me.

305
00:37:49,535 --> 00:37:51,793
Pancreatic cancer.

306
00:37:51,795 --> 00:37:55,889
If the disease wasn't
eating her up from the inside,

307
00:37:55,891 --> 00:37:59,801
then the chemo was kicking
the ever-loving shit out of her.

308
00:37:59,803 --> 00:38:02,045
And yet...
I don't know.

309
00:38:02,047 --> 00:38:03,396
Maybe, uh...

310
00:38:03,398 --> 00:38:07,809
Maybe the cancer just
put things in perspective.

311
00:38:07,811 --> 00:38:09,477
She was, uh...

312
00:38:09,479 --> 00:38:12,814
She was never
more beautiful.

313
00:38:14,818 --> 00:38:18,228
Didn't matter
how frail she got.

314
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:20,747
Even when
she lost her hair.

315
00:38:22,751 --> 00:38:25,235
Be grateful.

316
00:38:25,237 --> 00:38:27,012
Death...

317
00:38:27,014 --> 00:38:29,589
set her free.

318
00:38:29,591 --> 00:38:33,593
The thing is,
when she was gone,

319
00:38:33,595 --> 00:38:37,247
I just... I didn't feel
much of anything anymore.

320
00:38:37,249 --> 00:38:39,358
You know?

321
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:42,252
I didn't feel scared,
I didn't feel happy.

322
00:38:42,254 --> 00:38:43,845
I, uh...

323
00:38:43,847 --> 00:38:46,365
I didn't feel anything.

324
00:38:46,367 --> 00:38:49,368
I was just... here.

325
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:52,946
And that
is my strength.

326
00:38:52,948 --> 00:38:54,355
Now, me?

327
00:38:54,357 --> 00:38:57,267
I am dead
to this world.

328
00:38:57,269 --> 00:38:58,618
But you?

329
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:01,480
See,
you are pretending.

330
00:39:01,482 --> 00:39:04,015
You think
that it makes you strong

331
00:39:04,017 --> 00:39:06,626
to say
that emotions aren't real,

332
00:39:06,628 --> 00:39:08,962
that we are animals.

333
00:39:08,964 --> 00:39:11,114
That is bullshit.

334
00:39:11,116 --> 00:39:13,041
And you know it.

335
00:39:13,043 --> 00:39:14,876
And now you claim

336
00:39:14,878 --> 00:39:17,287
that you have to kill
your own daughter...

337
00:39:17,289 --> 00:39:20,399
your own
flesh and blood...

338
00:39:22,886 --> 00:39:25,645
It is her destiny.

339
00:39:32,413 --> 00:39:34,988
That disease...

340
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:37,882
took your wife...

341
00:39:37,884 --> 00:39:42,662
because that was
what nature intended.

342
00:39:42,664 --> 00:39:46,425
She could not
take you with her.

343
00:39:46,427 --> 00:39:50,003
But you live every day
wishing she could.

344
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:57,677
Lydia was made
for this.

345
00:39:59,681 --> 00:40:02,590
To be free.

346
00:40:02,592 --> 00:40:04,926
With me.

347
00:40:26,708 --> 00:40:29,283
You still love her.

348
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:47,486
I have to do it
because I love her.

349
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:54,901
She will always
be my baby.

350
00:41:21,522 --> 00:41:24,581
Thank you.

351
00:43:24,536 --> 00:43:27,537
Took you long enough.

352
00:43:33,756 --> 00:43:36,361
