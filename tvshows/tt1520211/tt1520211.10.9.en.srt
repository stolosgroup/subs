00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:04,770
You want her dead so bad,
you don't even care

3
00:00:04,772 --> 00:00:06,363
what happens to you.

4
00:00:06,365 --> 00:00:07,998
I'm all in.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,701
Whatever you want,
whatever I got,

6
00:00:10,703 --> 00:00:13,412
it's yours.

7
00:00:13,414 --> 00:00:14,880
Hey!

8
00:00:14,882 --> 00:00:16,465

Uh...

11
00:00:58,601 --> 00:01:01,102
Hey, guys?

12
00:01:30,024 --> 00:01:32,374
Make sure
they don't get out.

00:02:44,281 --> 00:02:46,374
Aah!

15
00:02:46,376 --> 00:02:48,584
Damn.
You okay?

16
00:02:50,104 --> 00:02:52,880
I almost had it.

17
00:02:52,882 --> 00:02:54,382
Nah,
it's too high.

18
00:02:54,384 --> 00:02:55,883
You risk
breakin' your neck.

19
00:02:55,885 --> 00:02:57,610
We need to find
a better way.

20
00:03:05,228 --> 00:03:06,727
You got something?

21
00:03:06,729 --> 00:03:09,455
Groundwater's
deeper in here.

22
00:03:09,457 --> 00:03:11,232
That water's
coming from outside.

23
00:03:11,234 --> 00:03:13,067
I don't see
a way across.

24
00:03:13,069 --> 00:03:14,860
Whoa, whoa.
Go back, go back.

25
00:03:18,408 --> 00:03:20,724
We could use those
to jump across.

26
00:03:20,726 --> 00:03:24,227
- Nice.
- Wait. For real?

27
00:03:32,588 --> 00:03:34,922
All right.

28
00:03:34,924 --> 00:03:37,316
You ready?

29
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:40,319
Let's go.

30
00:03:52,683 --> 00:03:54,925
Come on.

31
00:03:54,927 --> 00:03:57,336
Let's go!

32
00:05:19,028 --> 00:05:21,253
Do it now!

33
00:05:23,015 --> 00:05:25,348
No!
Hey! Hey!

34
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:27,092
Hey!
Come on!

35
00:05:28,371 --> 00:05:31,430
Hey, hey!

36
00:05:31,432 --> 00:05:34,041
Come on!
Come on!

37
00:05:34,043 --> 00:05:36,101
Come on.
I gotcha.

38
00:05:50,709 --> 00:05:52,393
Hey! Hey!

39
00:06:18,662 --> 00:06:21,496
Hey,
hand me that thing.

40
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,334
Knock yourself out,
dude.

41
00:06:42,853 --> 00:06:44,094
Alright.

42
00:06:44,096 --> 00:06:46,021
I need you to stay here,
all right?

43
00:06:46,023 --> 00:06:47,656
Keep everyone together.

44
00:06:56,942 --> 00:06:58,959
Should I even ask
how we're doing on food?

45
00:06:58,961 --> 00:07:00,276
Not great.

46
00:07:00,278 --> 00:07:02,037
Food?

47
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:04,298
How long do you think
we gonna be here?

48
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,966
Hey,
no worries.

49
00:07:05,968 --> 00:07:08,284
Walkers got in here
somehow.

50
00:07:08,286 --> 00:07:09,711
We'll get out.

51
00:07:09,713 --> 00:07:13,031
I think we know
exactly how they got here.

52
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:14,867
Alpha put them here.

53
00:07:14,869 --> 00:07:16,310
These are theirs.

54
00:07:16,312 --> 00:07:19,054
We have to assume
we're not alone.

55
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:25,819
I'm fine.

56
00:07:25,821 --> 00:07:29,639
Just a little winded.

57
00:07:29,641 --> 00:07:31,900
She's claustrophobic.

58
00:07:31,902 --> 00:07:34,553
Why didn't you
think of that

59
00:07:34,555 --> 00:07:36,889
before you got us all
trapped down here?

60
00:07:36,891 --> 00:07:38,240
Hey.

61
00:07:38,242 --> 00:07:40,909
It's not the time
for this.

62
00:07:40,911 --> 00:07:42,244
Why not?

63
00:07:42,246 --> 00:07:44,563
Seems like
we have plenty of it.

64
00:07:47,492 --> 00:07:51,512
What the hell
were you thinking, huh?

65
00:07:51,514 --> 00:07:53,572
Running off like that
by yourself.

66
00:07:53,574 --> 00:07:54,756
Hey!

67
00:07:54,758 --> 00:07:57,017
We ain't got time
for this shit.

68
00:07:57,019 --> 00:07:58,352
We got
in this mess together.

69
00:07:58,354 --> 00:07:59,669
We're gonna
get out of it together.

70
00:07:59,671 --> 00:08:00,854
Now follow me.

71
00:08:00,856 --> 00:08:02,915
I think
I found a way out.

72
00:08:32,446 --> 00:08:36,298
The enemy
are watching us.

73
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:39,042
A small group
crossed the border.

74
00:08:39,044 --> 00:08:41,636
They went straight to the edge
of the national forest.

75
00:08:41,638 --> 00:08:43,063
The horde...

76
00:08:43,065 --> 00:08:45,882
They knew
exactly where to look.

77
00:08:45,884 --> 00:08:47,884
Did they find it?

78
00:08:47,886 --> 00:08:51,054
We underestimated them.

79
00:08:51,056 --> 00:08:52,814
We have to assume

80
00:08:52,816 --> 00:08:57,319
they've been sending spies
across the border.

81
00:08:57,321 --> 00:09:00,989
I want more patrols
around the camp.

82
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:05,068
I want you
to take a message

83
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:08,071
to our eyes
along the border...

84
00:09:08,073 --> 00:09:09,739
they have failed.

85
00:10:07,374 --> 00:10:09,875
Hey. Can I...
Can I get matches?

86
00:10:09,877 --> 00:10:12,302
You should try to take it easy
for a minute.

87
00:10:12,304 --> 00:10:13,487
I can't.

88
00:10:13,489 --> 00:10:16,715
I need
to do something.

89
00:10:16,717 --> 00:10:18,659
Thanks.

90
00:10:39,664 --> 00:10:42,975
I never told you
I was claustrophobic.

91
00:10:44,669 --> 00:10:46,186
If I only knew
what you told me,

92
00:10:46,188 --> 00:10:48,096
I wouldn't know shit.

93
00:10:48,098 --> 00:10:50,399
Look who's talking.

94
00:10:55,197 --> 00:10:58,657
It's like I can't even
turn my back on you anymore.

95
00:11:00,444 --> 00:11:02,202
It's bad enough
I got Aaron running around

96
00:11:02,204 --> 00:11:03,686
with that skin freak.

97
00:11:03,688 --> 00:11:06,373
Now I gotta worry about you
all half-cocked

98
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:08,667
every time
you go outside.

99
00:11:10,104 --> 00:11:11,786
I'm sorry.

100
00:11:11,788 --> 00:11:15,424
I begged you
to talk to me.

101
00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:20,112
I wanna be there
for you.

102
00:11:20,114 --> 00:11:22,431
I do.

103
00:11:23,951 --> 00:11:27,185
I don't know
what to do anymore.

104
00:11:32,717 --> 00:11:37,404
I can't stop
thinking about it.

105
00:11:37,406 --> 00:11:41,224
I know I have to,
but I can't.

106
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:49,975
Oh, God.

107
00:11:49,977 --> 00:11:55,330
I don't want
to just kill Alpha.

108
00:11:55,332 --> 00:11:58,500
I want to hurt her.

109
00:12:00,262 --> 00:12:02,412
I want to make her
regret everything.

110
00:12:02,414 --> 00:12:04,264
I want her to beg
for forgiveness,

111
00:12:04,266 --> 00:12:07,768
and then
I want to kill her.

112
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:09,161
If I went through

113
00:12:09,163 --> 00:12:11,680
all the shit
that you went through...

114
00:12:11,682 --> 00:12:15,167
I'd probably feel
the same way.

115
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,005
Unless you tried
to stop me.

116
00:12:25,179 --> 00:12:28,288
You gotta quit
all this.

117
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:30,348
You gotta.

118
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:34,444
People you care about
are starting to get hurt.

119
00:12:40,027 --> 00:12:44,529
I didn't mean for any of this
to happen.

120
00:12:44,531 --> 00:12:46,698
I know I have to...

121
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,309
I know
I have to s...

122
00:12:49,311 --> 00:12:52,554
You gotta
not bullshit me.

123
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:55,707
Don't bullshit me.

124
00:12:55,709 --> 00:12:57,375
You gotta promise.

125
00:12:57,377 --> 00:13:00,562
I gotta know
we're on the same team.

126
00:13:03,217 --> 00:13:05,325
We fight
for our future.

127
00:13:05,327 --> 00:13:08,553
We don't fight
for revenge.

128
00:13:08,555 --> 00:13:11,223
I promise.

129
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:18,563
Alright.

130
00:14:12,895 --> 00:14:14,352
Skins!

131
00:14:53,343 --> 00:14:56,177
Let's go.

132
00:15:06,006 --> 00:15:08,006
If we don't follow each other
in the dark,

133
00:15:08,008 --> 00:15:09,449
we're gonna
get split up.

134
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:12,285
She's right.
We stick together.

135
00:15:12,287 --> 00:15:15,013
At least we know
there's a way out now.

136
00:15:15,015 --> 00:15:16,698
Yeah,
but where?

137
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,941
I think
they went this way.

138
00:15:18,943 --> 00:15:21,294
You see
where they went?

139
00:15:21,296 --> 00:15:24,022
Not exactly,
but...

140
00:15:24,024 --> 00:15:27,192
I know a road sign
when I see one.

141
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:39,204
Hey,
come on.

142
00:16:02,337 --> 00:16:05,230
Sorry to butt in.

143
00:16:05,232 --> 00:16:08,341
No pun intended.

144
00:16:10,587 --> 00:16:17,308
The latrine is at the edge
of the camp for hygiene,

145
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,603
not privacy.

146
00:16:21,081 --> 00:16:23,932
Ah, well, actually,
I, um...

147
00:16:23,934 --> 00:16:26,251
just wanted
to talk.

148
00:16:26,253 --> 00:16:28,253
About?

149
00:16:28,255 --> 00:16:31,364
Well, I hear we're supposed to
be keeping our eyes peeled

150
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:34,850
for a spy
lurkin' in the woods.

151
00:16:34,852 --> 00:16:38,354
I have an alternate theory
to run by you.

152
00:16:38,356 --> 00:16:40,932
The spy
you're looking for?

153
00:16:40,934 --> 00:16:43,192
Right here
in your camp.

154
00:16:43,194 --> 00:16:47,380
My people know the enemy have
nothing to offer except lies.

155
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:50,383
Maybe they do.
Maybe they don't.

156
00:16:50,385 --> 00:16:51,701
Believe it or not,

157
00:16:51,703 --> 00:16:54,203
I have been
where you are right now.

158
00:16:54,205 --> 00:16:57,632
And if you don't want to end up
where I am right now,

159
00:16:57,634 --> 00:17:00,785
I suggest you zig
where I zagged.

160
00:17:00,787 --> 00:17:06,066
You and I...
very different.

161
00:17:07,885 --> 00:17:09,294
I had people.

162
00:17:09,296 --> 00:17:10,695
I had a system.

163
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:12,405
I thought
they believed in it,

164
00:17:12,407 --> 00:17:13,815
just like you.

165
00:17:13,817 --> 00:17:15,133
See, the thing is,

166
00:17:15,135 --> 00:17:18,511
you stay king or queen
long enough,

167
00:17:18,513 --> 00:17:21,139
with people telling you
all day, every day

168
00:17:21,141 --> 00:17:23,250
that your shit
don't stink,

169
00:17:23,252 --> 00:17:26,144
eventually,
you start to believe it.

170
00:17:26,146 --> 00:17:29,905
The thing is...

171
00:17:29,907 --> 00:17:32,175
it still stinks.

172
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,911
Who?

173
00:17:35,913 --> 00:17:39,915
Well, based on
my own personal experience,

174
00:17:39,917 --> 00:17:42,677
I'd say
look closer to home.

175
00:17:42,679 --> 00:17:45,330
And, no,
I am not talkin' about

176
00:17:45,332 --> 00:17:47,165
Frankenstein's Hemorrhoid.

177
00:17:47,167 --> 00:17:50,335
That big dude
is clearly a goose stepper.

178
00:17:50,337 --> 00:17:51,945
But the little one...?

179
00:17:51,947 --> 00:17:54,906
You see,
she is close enough to you

180
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:57,784
that she knows
exactly where that horde was.

181
00:17:57,786 --> 00:17:59,694
But she guards
the border,

182
00:17:59,696 --> 00:18:01,696
which means
she's close enough to the enemy

183
00:18:01,698 --> 00:18:03,790
that they could've
gotten to her.

184
00:18:10,357 --> 00:18:14,134
I will not have you
sowing paranoia.

185
00:18:15,712 --> 00:18:20,122
If you breathe a word of this
to anyone,

186
00:18:20,124 --> 00:18:23,034
- I will take these.
- Aah!

187
00:19:05,187 --> 00:19:06,978
This is it!

188
00:19:11,418 --> 00:19:14,102
Oh, God.

189
00:19:16,606 --> 00:19:19,774
Alright,
just give me one minute.

190
00:19:19,776 --> 00:19:21,201
I'll be fine.

191
00:19:24,097 --> 00:19:28,190
Or not.

192
00:19:28,192 --> 00:19:30,835
Ooh, boy.

193
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:46,618
"You are... are...

194
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:50,230
O-K."

195
00:19:52,216 --> 00:19:54,109
"You are..."

196
00:19:55,219 --> 00:19:57,311
"You are okay."

197
00:20:20,654 --> 00:20:24,005
Oh, man.

198
00:20:59,134 --> 00:21:01,116
Hey.

199
00:21:01,118 --> 00:21:03,118
You all right
back there?

200
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,620
Yeah, sure.

201
00:21:04,622 --> 00:21:06,881
I'm just a 6'2" dude

202
00:21:06,883 --> 00:21:08,883
that had trouble fitting
into airplane bathrooms.

203
00:21:08,885 --> 00:21:10,368
Why wouldn't I be okay?

204
00:21:11,871 --> 00:21:13,871
Fair enough.

205
00:21:41,234 --> 00:21:43,084
Alright, I'm out.

206
00:21:43,086 --> 00:21:44,844
Follow my voice.

207
00:21:44,846 --> 00:21:47,572
Come on.

208
00:21:47,574 --> 00:21:49,574
Follow my voice.

209
00:21:49,576 --> 00:21:51,518
Come on.

210
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,853
That's it.

211
00:22:01,588 --> 00:22:03,178
Alright.

212
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:04,847
Alright.

213
00:22:04,849 --> 00:22:06,440
Come on.

214
00:22:13,858 --> 00:22:15,858
I'm good.

215
00:22:33,787 --> 00:22:36,470
Carol?

216
00:22:36,472 --> 00:22:39,232
Carol!

217
00:22:41,403 --> 00:22:43,644
I'm here.

218
00:22:43,646 --> 00:22:45,797
You hurt?

219
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:47,740
I'm okay.

220
00:22:47,742 --> 00:22:50,743
Can you see
my light?

221
00:22:50,745 --> 00:22:52,745
Yes.

222
00:22:52,747 --> 00:22:55,230
Just follow my light.

223
00:22:59,479 --> 00:23:01,087
I can't.

224
00:23:01,089 --> 00:23:02,830
I can't!

225
00:23:02,832 --> 00:23:05,666
Yes, you can.

226
00:23:05,668 --> 00:23:07,043
Come on.

227
00:23:07,045 --> 00:23:09,762
We're gonna
get through this together.

228
00:23:09,764 --> 00:23:12,156
Come on.
Come on.

229
00:23:40,795 --> 00:23:43,278
Go ahead.

230
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,114
I gotcha, I gotcha.

231
00:23:54,701 --> 00:23:56,267
Hey, guys...

232
00:23:57,812 --> 00:24:00,563
What is it?

233
00:24:03,151 --> 00:24:05,893
What is it?

234
00:24:05,895 --> 00:24:07,820
Just be quiet
for a second.

235
00:24:20,576 --> 00:24:23,519
Go, go, go! Go!

236
00:24:23,521 --> 00:24:24,987
Go, go, go!

237
00:24:39,095 --> 00:24:41,746
Jerry, come on!

238
00:24:47,178 --> 00:24:48,844
Come on!
Come on!

239
00:25:10,276 --> 00:25:11,776
Jerry!

240
00:25:11,778 --> 00:25:13,678
Come on!

241
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,614
You're almost there!

242
00:25:16,616 --> 00:25:17,890
Guys!

243
00:25:17,892 --> 00:25:20,542
I'm... I'm stuck.

244
00:25:24,215 --> 00:25:25,973
Here...
take my hand!

245
00:25:29,386 --> 00:25:31,796
Aah!

246
00:25:33,833 --> 00:25:35,133
My feet!

247
00:25:35,135 --> 00:25:37,076
My feet!
They got my feet!

248
00:25:37,078 --> 00:25:38,803
They're biting my feet!

249
00:25:42,083 --> 00:25:44,066
My feet!

250
00:25:44,068 --> 00:25:45,901
Take your gear off!

251
00:25:45,903 --> 00:25:47,995
Take it off!

252
00:26:05,589 --> 00:26:07,331
Come on.

253
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:13,929
Aah!

254
00:26:27,111 --> 00:26:29,537
You good?

255
00:26:29,539 --> 00:26:31,856
It's okay.

256
00:26:31,858 --> 00:26:33,541
They didn't bite through.

257
00:26:33,543 --> 00:26:36,193
You're good.
It's alright. It's okay.

258
00:26:46,706 --> 00:26:49,206
Hey.

259
00:26:49,208 --> 00:26:51,466
Look!

260
00:26:51,468 --> 00:26:53,878
Wait!

261
00:28:29,825 --> 00:28:32,460
Why are we standing around
looking at it?

262
00:28:34,255 --> 00:28:37,089
We got to be
very careful.

263
00:28:37,091 --> 00:28:39,150
We take out
the wrong piece,

264
00:28:39,152 --> 00:28:41,485
this whole thing
is gonna collapse.

265
00:29:00,931 --> 00:29:02,114
Where's Gamma?

266
00:29:02,116 --> 00:29:04,099
She never made it
to the border.

267
00:29:04,101 --> 00:29:06,360
I've sent four scouts
to find her.

268
00:29:06,362 --> 00:29:08,287
If there are spies
among us,

269
00:29:08,289 --> 00:29:10,289
maybe she's been captured.

270
00:29:10,291 --> 00:29:13,292
Or she is the spy.

271
00:29:13,294 --> 00:29:15,294
You believe
she has gone over?

272
00:29:15,296 --> 00:29:16,870
I suspect.

273
00:29:18,708 --> 00:29:22,617
I want you
to track her down.

274
00:29:22,619 --> 00:29:24,878
Bring her to me.

275
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,366
And if she has betrayed us,
I will kill her.

276
00:29:30,311 --> 00:29:33,137
I will
deal with her.

277
00:29:33,139 --> 00:29:35,964
And the pack
will watch.

278
00:29:42,215 --> 00:29:45,950
Alright,
find something to dig with.

279
00:29:52,834 --> 00:29:55,001
- Hey, Aaron, can you help me with this?
- Yeah, yeah.

280
00:30:05,829 --> 00:30:08,088
Hey, check this out.

281
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:09,331
Yo.

282
00:30:09,333 --> 00:30:11,909
Somebody left
this crate of dynamite.

283
00:30:11,911 --> 00:30:15,412
Yeah, okay,
that's really cool.

284
00:30:15,414 --> 00:30:17,189
But maybe
somebody left it there

285
00:30:17,191 --> 00:30:20,100
because it's obviously
insanely dangerous.

286
00:30:20,102 --> 00:30:22,194
That thing's sweatier
than I am.

287
00:30:22,196 --> 00:30:24,012
I need you
to put it back.

288
00:30:24,014 --> 00:30:25,923
Very carefully.

289
00:30:28,778 --> 00:30:32,096
Just... Just...

290
00:30:42,275 --> 00:30:43,624
Want to
take a break?

291
00:30:43,626 --> 00:30:45,776
I can rest when...
when we get home.

292
00:30:45,778 --> 00:30:49,555
- You in a hurry?
- I just don't wanna hang out here

293
00:30:49,557 --> 00:30:50,948
any longer
than I have to.

294
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:52,207
Do you?

295
00:30:52,209 --> 00:30:54,560
No, but...

296
00:30:54,562 --> 00:30:59,047
you barely rested,
haven't eaten anything.

297
00:30:59,049 --> 00:31:02,193
You never stop.

298
00:31:05,889 --> 00:31:10,467
I didn't leave things good
with Yumiko.

299
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:15,656
I'm sorry.

300
00:31:15,658 --> 00:31:18,066
Me too.

301
00:31:25,167 --> 00:31:27,318
You.

302
00:31:30,323 --> 00:31:33,081
Looks like
Mom's mad at me.

303
00:31:44,612 --> 00:31:47,405
Keep walkin'.

304
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:52,693
You know, this feels like
some sort of...

305
00:31:52,695 --> 00:31:54,954
fraternity initiation.

306
00:31:54,956 --> 00:31:57,531
Is that
what this is?

307
00:31:57,533 --> 00:31:59,107
Huh?

308
00:31:59,109 --> 00:32:00,701
Am I gonna get
my skin suit

309
00:32:00,703 --> 00:32:04,672
and finally get to learn
the secret Whisperer handshake?

310
00:32:05,791 --> 00:32:08,175
Eyes front.

311
00:32:09,795 --> 00:32:11,303
Alright.

312
00:32:11,305 --> 00:32:12,972
You don't wanna talk?

313
00:32:12,974 --> 00:32:14,473
I'm down with that.

314
00:32:14,475 --> 00:32:18,102
We just won't talk.

315
00:32:23,133 --> 00:32:24,541
You know, I...

316
00:32:24,543 --> 00:32:26,894
I'm big enough to admit it,
alright?

317
00:32:26,896 --> 00:32:28,379
I...

318
00:32:28,381 --> 00:32:32,283
I am not good with long,
uncomfortable silences.

319
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:38,539
Stop here.

320
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:42,634
I said...

321
00:32:42,636 --> 00:32:46,297
eyes front.

322
00:32:48,009 --> 00:32:50,067
Shit.

323
00:33:04,341 --> 00:33:07,584
Take off your clothes.

324
00:33:22,359 --> 00:33:25,694
You know what?
You were... You were right.

325
00:33:25,696 --> 00:33:28,789
We are different.

326
00:33:31,201 --> 00:33:35,203
I made myself
into a monster,

327
00:33:35,205 --> 00:33:39,350
because that is
what the world needed.

328
00:33:43,731 --> 00:33:46,807
I built something.

329
00:33:46,809 --> 00:33:49,568
I saved people.

330
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:52,813
My name...
it meant something.

331
00:33:52,815 --> 00:33:55,366
Turn around.

332
00:34:07,922 --> 00:34:10,589
Whoa.

333
00:34:12,927 --> 00:34:16,487
You're a crass man.

334
00:34:16,489 --> 00:34:19,006
I reckoned
you might appreciate

335
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:20,891
a crass reward.

336
00:34:22,436 --> 00:34:24,770
A reward?

337
00:34:24,772 --> 00:34:27,231
For what?

338
00:34:29,335 --> 00:34:32,093
The spy.

339
00:34:32,095 --> 00:34:34,446
Gamma.

340
00:34:35,992 --> 00:34:39,618
It took courage
to do what you did.

341
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:42,788
And I want
to express my gratitude

342
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:46,107
in a way
that you will understand.

343
00:34:46,109 --> 00:34:47,626
Wait.

344
00:34:47,628 --> 00:34:50,354
Are you just gonna...

345
00:34:50,356 --> 00:34:52,756
leave that mask on?

346
00:34:55,803 --> 00:34:58,304
Does my true skin
disturb you?

347
00:35:01,884 --> 00:35:03,958
Not at all.

348
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:07,271
Weirdly the opposite.

349
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:11,633
Wait.

350
00:35:11,635 --> 00:35:13,894
Wait.

351
00:35:13,896 --> 00:35:18,306
This isn't some sort of, uh,
praying mantis situation, is it?

352
00:35:18,308 --> 00:35:21,368
You cut off my head off
afterwards?

353
00:35:29,562 --> 00:35:31,078
Yeah, sorry.

354
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:35,507
I can't help but notice
that you didn't say no to that.

355
00:35:35,509 --> 00:35:37,826
Ah,
you know what?

356
00:35:37,828 --> 00:35:40,404
It's been
a long time.

357
00:35:40,406 --> 00:35:44,575
I reckon
I will take my chances.

358
00:35:49,748 --> 00:35:53,584
Stop... talking.

359
00:36:07,116 --> 00:36:09,917
Come on, go.

360
00:36:15,457 --> 00:36:17,049
Just a little more!

361
00:36:19,536 --> 00:36:22,370
Where's Carol?

362
00:36:25,059 --> 00:36:26,859
Damn it!

363
00:38:04,883 --> 00:38:06,566
Oh.

364
00:38:06,568 --> 00:38:09,644
Aah!

365
00:38:30,075 --> 00:38:32,075
Take my hand.

366
00:38:32,077 --> 00:38:35,078
Come on.

367
00:38:49,203 --> 00:38:52,020
What the hell
are you doing?

368
00:38:54,933 --> 00:38:58,710
We can take out half her horde
from here.

369
00:38:58,712 --> 00:39:01,696
You're gonna
get yourself killed.

370
00:39:06,461 --> 00:39:09,446
She killed my boy.

371
00:39:10,949 --> 00:39:12,799
I know.

372
00:39:12,801 --> 00:39:14,634
But you gotta
come back with me.

373
00:39:14,636 --> 00:39:18,471
Please.

374
00:39:18,473 --> 00:39:20,974
Come on.

375
00:39:22,628 --> 00:39:25,237
Aah!

376
00:39:39,144 --> 00:39:41,478
Come on!

377
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,663
Hey! Move!

378
00:39:53,842 --> 00:39:55,842
Hey! Hey!

379
00:39:55,844 --> 00:39:57,677
Come on!

380
00:39:57,679 --> 00:39:59,512
Come on!

381
00:39:59,514 --> 00:40:01,773
What are you doing?!

382
00:40:05,762 --> 00:40:08,171
Come on!

383
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:14,268
Ohh!

384
00:40:19,768 --> 00:40:21,109
We got freaks!

385
00:40:49,715 --> 00:40:52,157
Come on!

386
00:40:52,159 --> 00:40:54,734
- Come on!
- Hurry!

387
00:40:54,736 --> 00:40:56,219
I can't...

388
00:40:58,999 --> 00:41:01,959
Come on!

389
00:41:01,961 --> 00:41:04,819
Come on, guys!

390
00:41:04,821 --> 00:41:07,414
Come on!

391
00:41:15,015 --> 00:41:16,497
Give me your hand!
I'll pull her up!

392
00:41:16,499 --> 00:41:17,999
Come on!

393
00:41:18,001 --> 00:41:20,668
Give me your hand.

394
00:41:34,776 --> 00:41:37,035
We've got more skins!

395
00:41:46,104 --> 00:41:48,714
Get outta here!

396
00:41:48,716 --> 00:41:51,365
- Jerry!
- Aah!

397
00:41:51,367 --> 00:41:53,793
- Jerry, give me your hand!
- Aah!

398
00:41:55,781 --> 00:41:58,131
Jerry, now!

399
00:41:58,133 --> 00:42:00,116
Come on!

400
00:42:21,306 --> 00:42:23,415
No!

401
00:42:23,417 --> 00:42:24,991
No!

402
00:42:24,993 --> 00:42:26,567
No!

403
00:42:26,569 --> 00:42:28,253
No!

404
00:42:28,255 --> 00:42:30,905
No!

405
00:42:40,917 --> 00:42:45,328
Daryl...

406
00:42:45,330 --> 00:42:48,348
Daryl.

407
00:42:51,594 --> 00:42:52,852
It'll take us a week
to clear this.

408
00:42:52,854 --> 00:42:55,505
Then help me!

409
00:42:55,507 --> 00:43:00,343
No.

410
00:43:00,345 --> 00:43:03,013
We can't!

411
00:43:04,491 --> 00:43:08,442
That blast is gonna call
walkers and Whisperers

412
00:43:08,444 --> 00:43:11,688
from a hundred miles
from here.

413
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:14,190
We don't want our backs
pressed against this mountain

414
00:43:14,192 --> 00:43:17,360
when they come.

415
00:43:17,362 --> 00:43:21,364
We can't save them
if we're dead.

416
00:43:23,051 --> 00:43:26,219
Come on.

417
00:43:37,215 --> 00:43:40,383
Go ahead and say it to me.

418
00:43:40,385 --> 00:43:42,810
I deserve it.

419
00:43:42,812 --> 00:43:45,980
Just say it to me.

420
00:43:45,982 --> 00:43:48,566
You were right
about everything.

421
00:43:48,568 --> 00:43:50,393
Just say it.

422
00:43:50,395 --> 00:43:53,321
No, please.

423
00:43:53,323 --> 00:43:54,814
You cared about her.

424
00:43:54,816 --> 00:43:57,233
And now she's gone
because of me.

425
00:43:57,235 --> 00:44:00,512
Please,
just say it!

426
00:44:00,514 --> 00:44:04,257
Please say it!

427
00:44:06,836 --> 00:44:09,412
Go home.

428
00:44:09,414 --> 00:44:12,932
Tell the others
we found the horde.

429
00:44:12,934 --> 00:44:14,142
Where you gonna be?

430
00:44:14,144 --> 00:44:17,253
They got out before us.

431
00:44:17,255 --> 00:44:21,608
There's gotta be
another way in.

432
00:44:34,289 --> 00:44:36,789
No.

433
00:45:00,937 --> 00:45:03,781
