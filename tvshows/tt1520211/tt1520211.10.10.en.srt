2
00:00:01,978 --> 00:00:04,712
No. Please.

3
00:00:04,714 --> 00:00:06,622
Go home.

4
00:00:06,624 --> 00:00:08,123
Tell the others
we found the horde.

5
00:00:08,125 --> 00:00:09,525
Where are you
gonna be?

6
00:00:09,527 --> 00:00:11,010
There's got to be
another way in.

7
00:00:11,012 --> 00:00:13,904
The spy you're looking for,
right here in your camp.

8
00:00:13,906 --> 00:00:16,632
The little one, you see,
she is close enough to you

9
00:00:16,634 --> 00:00:19,060
that she knows exactly
where that horde was.

10
00:00:19,062 --> 00:00:21,303
I want you
to track her down.

11
00:00:21,305 --> 00:00:22,805
Bring her to me.

12
00:00:22,807 --> 00:00:25,278
And if she has betrayed us,
I will kill her.

15
00:02:24,745 --> 00:02:26,503
It's your turn.

16
00:02:40,277 --> 00:02:42,036
Hi.

17
00:02:42,038 --> 00:02:45,280
Aw.
Okay, okay, okay.

18
00:03:12,793 --> 00:03:13,901
No!

19
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,133
Rosita, do you copy?

20
00:03:54,001 --> 00:03:56,518
I'm the one
that knows Aaron.

21
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,969
We know who you are.

22
00:03:59,507 --> 00:04:02,858
The people you sent out,
they're in trouble,

23
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:06,620
trapped in a cave where Alpha
has placed her horde.

24
00:04:06,622 --> 00:04:09,348
Now, they could still
be in there

25
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:10,607
or they might've
gotten out.

26
00:04:10,609 --> 00:04:11,867
I don't know.

27
00:04:11,869 --> 00:04:14,019
You said the horde
was in a field.

28
00:04:14,021 --> 00:04:15,537
It was.

29
00:04:15,539 --> 00:04:18,114
Now it's in a cave.

30
00:04:18,116 --> 00:04:21,026
She moved it.

31
00:04:21,028 --> 00:04:23,028
The whole thing.

32
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:25,698
Right before
they got there.

33
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:32,462
I'm just telling you
what happened.

34
00:04:32,464 --> 00:04:35,465
I'm not sure you are.

35
00:04:39,046 --> 00:04:41,380
I'm trying to help.

36
00:04:41,382 --> 00:04:43,549
Why?

37
00:04:48,831 --> 00:04:54,226
The baby that they left
at Hilltop,

38
00:04:54,228 --> 00:04:56,578
he's my nephew.

39
00:04:58,049 --> 00:05:02,067
And I would do anything
to see him again.

40
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:04,419
Where's the baby's mother?

41
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:15,915
Dead.

42
00:05:22,681 --> 00:05:23,939
If I give you a map,

43
00:05:23,941 --> 00:05:25,925
can you show us
where the cave is?

44
00:05:27,428 --> 00:05:29,929
Yes.

45
00:05:53,229 --> 00:05:55,454
You're a liar.

46
00:05:55,456 --> 00:05:57,714
The cell.

47
00:07:33,054 --> 00:07:35,162
It's from
the last one.

48
00:07:35,164 --> 00:07:38,815
The last Whisperer
we had in here.

49
00:07:38,817 --> 00:07:40,575
You killed him?

50
00:07:40,577 --> 00:07:42,169
No.

51
00:07:49,161 --> 00:07:51,679
I did.

52
00:07:53,349 --> 00:07:57,576
It was the one
your people sent to spy on us.

53
00:07:57,578 --> 00:08:00,079
He killed my baby's father
two days ago.

54
00:08:05,361 --> 00:08:07,419
I don't know anything
about that.

55
00:08:07,421 --> 00:08:09,679
Right.
Never heard of him.

56
00:08:09,681 --> 00:08:11,198
- I haven't.
- Mm.

57
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,534
I don't... uh...

58
00:08:13,536 --> 00:08:16,929
It's amazing how much you say
you don't know.

59
00:08:16,931 --> 00:08:19,022
Let me lay it out
for you.

60
00:08:19,024 --> 00:08:22,117
You're gonna work very hard
in this room.

61
00:08:22,119 --> 00:08:24,619
You're gonna have to
convince us

62
00:08:24,621 --> 00:08:27,214
that you're different
from the ones who lie

63
00:08:27,216 --> 00:08:32,177
and walk with the dead
and eat worms.

64
00:08:33,797 --> 00:08:35,556
And what if I can't?

65
00:08:35,558 --> 00:08:37,599
Then you die.

66
00:08:38,877 --> 00:08:41,228
No torture.
No games.

67
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:43,121
No second chances.

68
00:08:43,123 --> 00:08:46,066
You'd be the third one,
by the way.

69
00:08:48,295 --> 00:08:51,129
All's I've done
is tell you the truth.

70
00:08:51,131 --> 00:08:52,889
You haven't.

71
00:08:52,891 --> 00:08:56,577
This is not for show.

72
00:08:56,579 --> 00:08:59,413
I am
a servant of God.

73
00:08:59,415 --> 00:09:01,156
I've taken
many confessions,

74
00:09:01,158 --> 00:09:03,917
and I can tell when people
are holding things back.

75
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:07,162
Holding things back
is the same as lying.

76
00:09:07,164 --> 00:09:08,905
Outside at the gate,

77
00:09:08,907 --> 00:09:11,741
the story you had about being
the aunt of the baby...

78
00:09:11,743 --> 00:09:13,318
It's not a story.

79
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,670
...it does tug
at all the right heartstrings,

80
00:09:15,672 --> 00:09:17,598
but you're
hiding something,

81
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,975
which makes the whole thing
a lie.

82
00:09:21,586 --> 00:09:23,678
Ask God if I'm lying.

83
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,639
I've spoken to God.

84
00:09:25,641 --> 00:09:28,484
He told me
to hang you.

85
00:09:40,456 --> 00:09:43,081
I, uh...

86
00:09:45,944 --> 00:09:49,946
I killed my sister.

87
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:54,543
I killed my sister.

88
00:09:54,545 --> 00:09:58,213
I killed...

89
00:10:02,219 --> 00:10:05,203
I killed her for Alpha.

90
00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:07,964
She didn't even have to ask.

91
00:10:07,966 --> 00:10:10,725
I just did it.

92
00:10:25,742 --> 00:10:28,910
You believe me now,
Father?

93
00:10:37,513 --> 00:10:40,255
Then you should get me
a map.

94
00:11:35,321 --> 00:11:37,129
Aah!

95
00:11:37,131 --> 00:11:39,740
Where are they?!

96
00:11:42,803 --> 00:11:44,803
Tell me!

97
00:12:20,113 --> 00:12:23,143
So,
14 miles inland here?

98
00:12:23,145 --> 00:12:23,952
Yes.

99
00:12:23,954 --> 00:12:25,193
Any other way
in or out?

100
00:12:25,195 --> 00:12:27,475
There are others
in the area.

101
00:12:27,477 --> 00:12:29,009
I'm not sure where.

102
00:12:29,011 --> 00:12:31,448
And they'll be guarded.

103
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:33,201
Did Earl send
those new weapon sets?

104
00:12:33,203 --> 00:12:34,741
Yeah.
Enough for all of us.

105
00:12:34,743 --> 00:12:36,296
Good.
We're gonna need them.

106
00:12:36,298 --> 00:12:38,155
What about the border?

107
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:40,001
It's gonna be guarded
all the way down to...

108
00:12:40,003 --> 00:12:42,594
It's clear.

109
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:44,287
It's too long
for Alpha to defend.

110
00:12:44,289 --> 00:12:46,974
Most of the patrols
will be near the cave.

111
00:12:50,537 --> 00:12:53,054
Take her back
to her cell.

112
00:13:04,994 --> 00:13:06,309
So,
two rescue parties.

113
00:13:06,311 --> 00:13:07,661
Rosita and I
will take the first...

114
00:13:07,663 --> 00:13:10,313
We don't know
if any of this is real.

115
00:13:10,315 --> 00:13:12,057
Don't we?

116
00:13:12,059 --> 00:13:14,559
You said you were sure
she wasn't lying.

117
00:13:14,561 --> 00:13:17,229
I am,
and she isn't.

118
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:21,733
You all
are hesitating

119
00:13:21,735 --> 00:13:24,327
because you're afraid of them,
right?

120
00:13:24,329 --> 00:13:25,679
You shouldn't be.

121
00:13:25,681 --> 00:13:28,164
That's why I brought her
in here.

122
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:30,500
- So you could see.
- See what?

123
00:13:30,502 --> 00:13:32,577
That they're cowards.

124
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:33,836
We broke her.

125
00:13:33,838 --> 00:13:35,171
Completely.

126
00:13:35,173 --> 00:13:38,099
And if we can break her,
we can break others.

127
00:13:38,101 --> 00:13:41,361
If you come across one of them,
keep them alive,

128
00:13:41,363 --> 00:13:44,256
start pulling teeth
and taking fingers.

129
00:13:44,258 --> 00:13:46,808
Get information,
because we now know

130
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:49,185
the more pain and fear
you pour over them,

131
00:13:49,187 --> 00:13:50,528
the sooner
they drop the act,

132
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:51,780
which is
what it is.

133
00:15:54,237 --> 00:15:56,237
You okay?

134
00:15:56,239 --> 00:15:59,724
You seemed a little off
in the meeting room.

135
00:15:59,726 --> 00:16:02,210
I don't know
what you're talking about.

136
00:16:05,674 --> 00:16:08,491
Look,
why don't you stay here

137
00:16:08,493 --> 00:16:10,493
and look over the defenses at the gate?

138
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:12,012
Smart thing
would be having me out there.

139
00:16:12,014 --> 00:16:13,738
I don't think it is.

140
00:16:14,725 --> 00:16:17,075
I'm not gonna freeze.
I'm good.

141
00:16:17,077 --> 00:16:18,843
But you need to worry
about your shit.

142
00:16:18,845 --> 00:16:21,045
- What is that supposed to mean?
- Means you're erratic.

143
00:16:21,047 --> 00:16:23,264
- Name one thing I've done that's been erratic.
- "Cut off their fingers.

144
00:16:23,266 --> 00:16:24,524
Pull out their teeth."

145
00:16:24,526 --> 00:16:26,267
You're itching
for a fight.

146
00:16:26,269 --> 00:16:27,527
So what if I am?

147
00:16:35,429 --> 00:16:40,765
I can feel
that Coco is...

148
00:16:42,527 --> 00:16:45,528
...wondering where he is.

149
00:16:46,882 --> 00:16:48,440
And I don't want her...

150
00:16:48,442 --> 00:16:50,199
I know.

151
00:16:51,778 --> 00:16:54,054
Right.
I'll see you out there.

152
00:16:54,056 --> 00:16:56,556
- You don't have to...
- I'll see you out there.

153
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:00,477
I'll make it
really fast.

154
00:17:00,479 --> 00:17:02,787
I'll be right back.

155
00:17:02,789 --> 00:17:04,814
What's your name?

156
00:17:11,147 --> 00:17:15,316
Nobody's asked me
since I got here.

157
00:17:15,318 --> 00:17:17,535
It's Mary.

158
00:17:19,063 --> 00:17:21,873
What were you like
before the Whisperers?

159
00:17:34,821 --> 00:17:37,171
I'm from Santa Monica.

160
00:17:37,173 --> 00:17:40,916
That was
in California.

161
00:17:40,918 --> 00:17:45,087
My parents' names
were John and Alice.

162
00:17:45,089 --> 00:17:47,524
I went to school and...

163
00:18:00,363 --> 00:18:02,697
I don't remember.

164
00:18:02,699 --> 00:18:05,700
What do you mean?

165
00:18:10,206 --> 00:18:14,467
Alpha has a way
of, um...

166
00:18:14,469 --> 00:18:17,378
making you forget.

167
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:21,141
You really don't
remember anything?

168
00:18:22,702 --> 00:18:30,224
There are echoes left,
feelings.

169
00:18:31,878 --> 00:18:33,878
I was ordinary.

170
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,989
That much I know.

171
00:18:35,991 --> 00:18:39,993
And when
it all went down,

172
00:18:39,995 --> 00:18:45,890
my sister and I
kept making bad decisions.

173
00:18:45,892 --> 00:18:50,170
We needed someone
to make them for us,

174
00:18:50,172 --> 00:18:52,747
and then we met Alpha.

175
00:18:54,751 --> 00:18:57,510
You met
the wrong person first.

176
00:18:57,512 --> 00:19:00,254
If you'd met
my mom or my dad,

177
00:19:00,256 --> 00:19:02,423
you wouldn't be
in that cell.

178
00:19:07,914 --> 00:19:10,431
You don't look like
a monster to me.

179
00:19:12,027 --> 00:19:13,360
Judith.

180
00:19:15,271 --> 00:19:17,438
We're about
to go on lockdown.

181
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,774
You should get inside.

182
00:19:21,277 --> 00:19:22,777
Bye.

183
00:19:22,779 --> 00:19:25,205
Bye.

184
00:20:41,983 --> 00:20:43,483
Aah!

185
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:16,816
- How many can you see in the herd?
- 100 at least.

186
00:21:16,818 --> 00:21:18,392
It's hard to tell,

187
00:21:18,394 --> 00:21:20,044
but it looks like
there are Whisperers in it.

188
00:21:20,046 --> 00:21:22,547
It's on its way.
What should we...

189
00:21:22,549 --> 00:21:25,049
Echo post, say again.
We lost you.

190
00:21:25,051 --> 00:21:28,236
Echo post, respond.

191
00:21:29,498 --> 00:21:31,146
That watch tower's
two miles away.

192
00:21:31,148 --> 00:21:32,815
We can't let this next wave
bunch up at the gate

193
00:21:32,817 --> 00:21:34,225
the way
the last one did.

194
00:21:34,227 --> 00:21:35,910
Why would they
send a herd now?

195
00:21:35,912 --> 00:21:37,912
We have a defector
giving us information.

196
00:21:37,914 --> 00:21:40,155
They're trying to stop us
before we act on it.

197
00:21:40,157 --> 00:21:42,842
We're gonna have to split up
if we want to cover both gates.

198
00:21:42,844 --> 00:21:45,178
That means less people
out there.

199
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:48,072
We don't have a choice.

200
00:21:48,074 --> 00:21:49,423
Show of hands...

201
00:21:49,425 --> 00:21:50,833
how many people here
have been on gate duty?

202
00:21:50,835 --> 00:21:52,018
I have.

203
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,595
Alright,
how many do we need?

204
00:21:54,597 --> 00:21:56,189
Need or want?

205
00:21:56,191 --> 00:22:00,193
Six, plus you, me,
Rosita, and Gabe.

206
00:22:00,195 --> 00:22:01,586
Alright, you seven,

207
00:22:01,588 --> 00:22:03,087
you're gonna be
on the main gate.

208
00:22:03,089 --> 00:22:04,531
Hold on. New plan.

209
00:22:04,533 --> 00:22:06,015
Rosita and Laura,

210
00:22:06,017 --> 00:22:08,426
stay back on gate security
with a skeleton crew.

211
00:22:08,428 --> 00:22:10,887
You and I take a squad
out to the outpost,

212
00:22:10,889 --> 00:22:12,947
break up the herd,
and then move on to the cave.

213
00:22:12,949 --> 00:22:14,523
- Good?
- Yeah. Yeah.

214
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,452
Gonna grab that.

215
00:22:18,454 --> 00:22:21,363
- I didn't want... I'm not trying to speak for you.
- No, it's fine.

216
00:22:21,365 --> 00:22:24,625
I don't trust myself
out there anyway.

217
00:22:24,627 --> 00:22:28,296
Could get us both killed,
and then Coco would...

218
00:22:28,298 --> 00:22:30,631
It's okay.

219
00:22:30,633 --> 00:22:34,468
I'm having nightmares
about them.

220
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:36,879
Dreams they're killing me.

221
00:22:36,881 --> 00:22:39,457
We're good to go.

222
00:22:49,469 --> 00:22:52,136
I'll see you soon.

223
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:03,465
All I'm saying is
we could make it into a game.

224
00:24:03,467 --> 00:24:05,393
I kill
more skins than you,

225
00:24:05,395 --> 00:24:07,395
you take my watch duties
for a month.

226
00:24:07,397 --> 00:24:09,563
I don't wanna mess around
out there, man.

227
00:24:09,565 --> 00:24:11,883
Aw.
What, are you scared?

228
00:24:11,885 --> 00:24:13,308
Remember Lydia?

229
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:15,403
My friends and I
beat the shit out of her.

230
00:24:15,405 --> 00:24:17,238
She barely
put up a fight.

231
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,407
I'm telling you, man,
one on one,

232
00:24:19,409 --> 00:24:22,894
the Whisperers
are a joke.

233
00:25:29,237 --> 00:25:32,221
This don't make sense.

234
00:25:32,223 --> 00:25:34,482
What the hell happened?

235
00:25:34,484 --> 00:25:36,892
We'll go back
the way we came.

236
00:25:36,894 --> 00:25:39,228
You don't see
anything coming?

237
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:41,247
No, nothing.

238
00:25:41,249 --> 00:25:44,141
No sign of a herd.

239
00:25:44,143 --> 00:25:46,252
No walkers.

240
00:25:46,254 --> 00:25:48,496
What the hell
is going on?

241
00:26:01,677 --> 00:26:03,344
They were forced
to call.

242
00:26:03,346 --> 00:26:05,513
Must've held the knife
to her throat

243
00:26:05,515 --> 00:26:09,166
to make him call us
and lie.

244
00:26:09,168 --> 00:26:10,518
Why?

245
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:13,020
Most of us
are out here.

246
00:26:13,022 --> 00:26:15,281
There's hardly anybody...

247
00:26:15,283 --> 00:26:16,949
back home.

248
00:26:40,958 --> 00:26:42,700
Walkers!

249
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:52,209
They're here.

250
00:26:52,211 --> 00:26:54,970
Check Morgan Street.
Come with me.

251
00:27:42,778 --> 00:27:47,022
This place...
it isn't what she said it was.

252
00:27:47,024 --> 00:27:49,375
She lied.

253
00:27:55,383 --> 00:27:58,109
These are not
your people.

254
00:27:58,111 --> 00:27:59,385
But she lied.

255
00:27:59,387 --> 00:28:04,115
She is your Alpha.

256
00:28:07,637 --> 00:28:10,897
You think
you're still alive.

257
00:28:12,975 --> 00:28:16,644
You were dead
the moment you came to us.

258
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:23,484
Step towards me.

259
00:28:25,488 --> 00:28:27,413
Why?

260
00:28:27,415 --> 00:28:30,991
She wants you.

261
00:28:30,993 --> 00:28:35,829
She said your death
would be painless.

262
00:28:35,831 --> 00:28:41,427
If you fight,
it will not be.

263
00:28:41,429 --> 00:28:44,931
Step towards me.

264
00:28:57,094 --> 00:29:01,522
All she wants
is me in pain.

265
00:29:04,101 --> 00:29:07,453
You're lying for her.

266
00:29:07,455 --> 00:29:10,698
Step towards me.

267
00:29:17,707 --> 00:29:21,801
I am not afraid
of you.

268
00:29:21,803 --> 00:29:24,695
Yes, you are.

269
00:29:32,722 --> 00:29:35,297
Get help.

270
00:29:55,745 --> 00:29:58,504
Help!

271
00:29:58,506 --> 00:30:01,674
In here.

272
00:32:05,875 --> 00:32:09,193
Okay, go, go.
Fast, fast.

273
00:32:18,003 --> 00:32:20,204
Aah!

274
00:32:32,551 --> 00:32:35,644
Hey!

275
00:33:13,259 --> 00:33:14,441
Stop!

276
00:33:18,706 --> 00:33:21,949
Alpha wants me alive.

277
00:33:26,305 --> 00:33:29,364
Step towards me.

278
00:33:36,949 --> 00:33:39,450
You will fall.

279
00:33:39,452 --> 00:33:41,952
You will rise.

280
00:33:41,954 --> 00:33:46,023
You will walk
with your sister again.

281
00:33:58,395 --> 00:34:01,138
No, I wasn't...

282
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:03,565
I-I didn't...

283
00:34:03,567 --> 00:34:05,251
I didn't betray you.

284
00:34:05,253 --> 00:34:09,404
I just... I-I drew him out here
because he was gonna...

285
00:34:11,759 --> 00:34:13,500
Please.

286
00:34:13,502 --> 00:34:15,410
Please.

287
00:34:17,506 --> 00:34:19,914
I'm telling the truth.

288
00:35:16,306 --> 00:35:21,234
Can you see
beyond the darkness

289
00:35:21,236 --> 00:35:23,737
into the light?

290
00:35:23,739 --> 00:35:27,240
No.

291
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:37,067
I'm tingling
with joy...

292
00:35:37,069 --> 00:35:43,665
as I see the ones
who broke me...

293
00:35:43,667 --> 00:35:49,188
all around us,
standing there.

294
00:35:53,677 --> 00:35:56,678
Thank you.

295
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,989
Thank you.

296
00:36:00,234 --> 00:36:03,427
Thank you.

297
00:36:03,429 --> 00:36:07,998
Thank you
for making me strong.

298
00:36:12,213 --> 00:36:16,215
Pain made me.

299
00:36:16,217 --> 00:36:20,219
Pain made you.

300
00:36:20,221 --> 00:36:23,931
Pain made my Lydia.

301
00:36:25,618 --> 00:36:27,284
You lost her.

302
00:36:29,471 --> 00:36:32,022
You drove her away.

303
00:36:33,642 --> 00:36:36,235
'Cause you didn't
love her.

304
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:41,240
What did you say?

305
00:36:51,252 --> 00:36:54,235
What did you say,
boy?

306
00:36:54,237 --> 00:36:57,381
I can't hear you.

307
00:37:13,107 --> 00:37:15,607
I'm all ears.

308
00:38:16,729 --> 00:38:19,988
Are you really here?

309
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:22,566
Yes, Mama.

310
00:38:22,568 --> 00:38:25,827
Don't call me that.

311
00:38:25,829 --> 00:38:28,405
You know better.

312
00:38:30,351 --> 00:38:33,927
You came home.

313
00:38:36,357 --> 00:38:45,088
I am you,
and you are me.

I made sure
you're ready.

331
00:39:59,681 --> 00:40:04,501
They're waiting
for you to lead.

They're waiting.

333
00:40:09,007 --> 00:40:12,692
I'm not here
for them.

334
00:40:12,694 --> 00:40:16,346
I'm not here
for you.

335
00:40:20,276 --> 00:40:23,036
They're human.

336
00:40:23,038 --> 00:40:27,874
Not perfect.

337
00:40:27,876 --> 00:40:31,452
Just human.

338
00:40:34,457 --> 00:40:38,368
It's all
I ever wanted.

339
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:41,538
It's what
you never gave me.

340
00:40:51,492 --> 00:40:54,493
I need you.

341
00:40:54,495 --> 00:40:57,237
I need you.

342
00:40:57,239 --> 00:41:02,316
I want you to...

343
00:41:02,318 --> 00:41:06,746
stay.

344
00:42:21,306 --> 00:42:22,556
This was Dante.

345
00:42:22,558 --> 00:42:24,583
Scouts in the tunnels
are saying

346
00:42:24,585 --> 00:42:28,236
the Whisperers sealed
whole sections off.

347
00:42:28,238 --> 00:42:30,313
Aaron.

348
00:42:33,151 --> 00:42:35,318
You're alright.

349
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:38,488
Yeah. We, uh...

350
00:42:39,841 --> 00:42:41,157
What happened?

351
00:42:41,159 --> 00:42:43,584
Aaron,
where are the others?

352
00:42:43,586 --> 00:42:45,011
We got separated.

353
00:42:45,013 --> 00:42:47,588
Most of us got out.

354
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:50,091
Most of you?

355
00:42:51,612 --> 00:42:55,188
Not everyone.

356
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:56,782
You sure
you don't want her with you?

357
00:42:56,784 --> 00:42:58,599
It's a short trip.

358
00:42:58,601 --> 00:43:01,027
No, I'll be back as soon as
the doctor at Hilltop clears me.

359
00:43:01,029 --> 00:43:03,104
Besides,
they could still be out there.

360
00:43:03,106 --> 00:43:05,849
I want her safe,
and safe is with you.

361
00:43:05,851 --> 00:43:07,350
Okay.

362
00:43:10,856 --> 00:43:12,923
Room for three more!

363
00:43:22,050 --> 00:43:24,476
I'm Rosita.

364
00:43:25,628 --> 00:43:27,704
Mary.

365
00:43:27,706 --> 00:43:29,889
I know.

366
00:43:43,388 --> 00:43:45,664
Easy, easy.

367
00:43:50,838 --> 00:43:54,130
How long
I been asleep for?

368
00:43:55,734 --> 00:43:58,301
Most of the day.

369
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:02,848
And you were just
out here?

370
00:44:02,850 --> 00:44:04,574
Yeah.

371
00:44:04,576 --> 00:44:07,335
Just watching you.

372
00:44:07,337 --> 00:44:09,913
Watching them.

373
00:44:09,915 --> 00:44:11,672
Deciding.

374
00:44:11,674 --> 00:44:14,317
Deciding what?

375
00:44:19,091 --> 00:44:22,183
Did you kill her?

376
00:44:23,261 --> 00:44:26,763
If it was your father,
could you have?

377
00:44:35,123 --> 00:44:38,458
I'm no longer weak.

378
00:44:41,446 --> 00:44:45,298
I'm stronger than ever.

379
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:52,363
Our horde will butcher
and consume them.

380
00:44:52,365 --> 00:44:57,977
Screams will be song
to me.

381
00:45:20,652 --> 00:45:22,819
We bathe in blood.

382
00:45:22,821 --> 00:45:24,337
We are free.

383
00:45:24,339 --> 00:45:26,506
We love no one.

384
00:45:26,508 --> 00:45:28,491
We are free.

385
00:45:28,493 --> 00:45:30,677
We fear nothing.

386
00:45:30,679 --> 00:45:32,586
We are free.

387
00:45:32,588 --> 00:45:36,107
This is the end of the world.

388
00:45:36,109 --> 00:45:39,519
Now is the end of the world.

389
00:45:39,521 --> 00:45:42,906
We are the end of the world.
