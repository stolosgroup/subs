00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:51,275
What happened here?

3
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:58,157
We'll never know.

4
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:12,226
What are you doing?

5
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,974
I'm gonna search them.

6
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:16,306
There could be something here.

7
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:03,861
Two more.

8
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,882
One, two, three.

9
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:16,387
Pull.

10
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,666
Hey! Do you see anything?!

11
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:33,507
Just a ladder.

12
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:53,606
Anything?

13
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:20,550
One more.

14
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:23,260
We've been at this for two weeks.

15
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:24,936
What do we have to show? I...

16
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,766
I... I can't.

17
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,647
We've got to see this through.

18
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:32,069
No, we don't.

19
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:34,568
We can go back,
check the hunting grounds...

20
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:36,239
There's no food there. It's spent.

21
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:39,990
So is other other place
on Maggie's goddamn map!

22
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:46,242
Look, I just...

23
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:49,170
I miss my daughter.

24
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,042
I know you miss yours, too.

25
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:04,639
One more.

26
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:45,018
Little help?

27
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:46,518
Yeah.

28
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:54,230
Here.

29
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,502
There's a water tower

30
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:21,633
by our last location.

31
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:23,659
- We just need to head north...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

32
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:26,767
- ...until we see it, and then...
- We are not doing this without a map.

33
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:28,185
It's only an hour away.

34
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:29,682
I don't care.

35
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:35,268
Fine.

36
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,774
We'll follow our tracks back.

37
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:03,630
Was this on the map?

38
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:06,056
No.

39
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:53,744
Hello?

40
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:21,688
Hello?

41
00:14:24,906 --> 00:14:27,523
My name is Aaron.

42
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:29,825
I'm a friend.

43
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:34,413
Please... don't be afraid.

44
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:39,831
Hello?

45
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:02,399
He...

46
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:04,693
He just came at me.

47
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:08,022
I didn't...

48
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:09,698
I didn't, uh...

49
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,745
What?

50
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:19,951
Nothing.

51
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:22,457
It's just... that was, um...

52
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:24,413
That was quite the scream.

53
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:27,875
These things are vicious!

54
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:29,756
Clearly. No.

55
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:31,428
Hence...

56
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:33,380
the scream.

57
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:41,723
I'm... I'm sorry.

58
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:46,230
Alright.

59
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,234
Let it all out.

60
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:51,906
Oh...

61
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:53,154
Are you through?

62
00:15:53,244 --> 00:15:55,031
I'm not through.

63
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:02,496
Oh, Lord!

64
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,382
Oh...

65
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,306
You know what I feel like?

66
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,099
What?

67
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:20,937
Dinner...

68
00:16:23,191 --> 00:16:24,557
...and...

69
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:27,685
...drink.

70
00:16:34,202 --> 00:16:35,784
Hey.

71
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:38,863
You remember these?

72
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:41,323
I remember news footage
of people in toy stores

73
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:42,999
trampling over each other to get them.

74
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:44,246
Yeah.

75
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:46,329
Gracie's gonna go nuts.

76
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:48,288
One for Coco.

77
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:58,052
Okay.

78
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:10,819
That's it?

79
00:17:10,905 --> 00:17:11,941
Yes.

80
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,031
That's all we get.

81
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:14,356
Why?

82
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:15,782
It's just whiskey.

83
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:16,868
No.

84
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:19,570
It's not "just whiskey."

85
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:21,872
It's perfection.

86
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,745
It's rare.

87
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:25,575
This bottle?

88
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:28,788
Easily cost over $2,000.

89
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:31,168
The fact that people would
pay that much to get drunk

90
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:33,251
is a huge part of what
was wrong with the world.

91
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:35,961
The point isn't to get drunk, it's...

92
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:39,469
Just take the cup to your nose and sniff.

93
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:43,385
Now take a moment...

94
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:45,471
and tell me what smells you're getting.

95
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:47,852
What does it remind you of?

96
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,936
Maple syrup.

97
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:57,783
Vanilla.

98
00:17:57,868 --> 00:18:00,281
Breakfast as a kid.

99
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:02,158
Now take a sip.

100
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:04,865
And let it sit.

101
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:06,541
Now pay attention to the finish.

102
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:08,414
How the flavor evolves.

103
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:12,622
Wow.

104
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:14,549
Yeah, exactly.

105
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:15,876
Now, we eat.

106
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:18,633
And the meat will taste even better.

107
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:20,510
Okay.

108
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:27,304
Hey... look...

109
00:18:27,398 --> 00:18:30,436
I get that it's, uh...

110
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,108
rare and all,

111
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:33,856
but, um...

112
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:37,064
...we've had a rough day.

113
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:38,615
You know?

114
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:55,290
Bullshit.

115
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:56,966
You don't have it.

116
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:58,715
Then call.

117
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:01,217
I don't have enough to call.

118
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:04,141
You have the whiskey...

119
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:22,822
Many thanks.

120
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:25,120
No, no, no, no, no.

121
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:26,993
Show me.

122
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:38,091
So, what does God think of you

123
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:42,888
drinking and gambling right now?

124
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:44,555
He's probably okay with it.

125
00:19:44,642 --> 00:19:46,429
Oh, yeah?

126
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:51,435
Is card sharking
part of proper priest training?

127
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:54,062
Was there a whiskey class in the seminary?

128
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:56,768
- Actually, yes, there was.
- Oh.

129
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:01,022
I'm serious.

130
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:04,568
I had a mentor.

131
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:06,449
Reverend George.

132
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,326
He was a good friend.

133
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:11,580
And a great teacher.

134
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:15,538
And my first "class" with him

135
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:18,044
was at a boy's funeral.

136
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:23,879
Tommy Franklin.

137
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:25,464
He died of cancer.

138
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:28,892
He was in his freshman year
of college and...

139
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,437
...and he died.

140
00:20:35,109 --> 00:20:37,351
And everyone in town came to the funeral.

141
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:40,279
And Reverend George performed the service.

142
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:43,357
He spoke as they lowered Tommy
into the ground.

143
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:46,694
And he said all the right things.

144
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:49,200
Without even trying.

145
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:53,455
At least, you know...
it didn't look like he was...

146
00:20:57,631 --> 00:21:00,214
Anyways...

147
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:02,042
funeral ends,

148
00:21:02,136 --> 00:21:04,093
and we get in his car to go to the wake.

149
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:07,844
and he... he just takes off.

150
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:11,176
80 the whole way.

151
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,478
He says, "We have to get there
before the others!"

152
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:16,056
And he's running stop signs

153
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:18,767
and saying a prayer each time he does,

154
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:22,400
and my eyes were closed the whole way.

155
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:27,614
And we get there, and he...

156
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:30,161
he heads straight for the liquor cabinet.

157
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:32,660
I say, "What are you doing, Reverend?"

158
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,582
And he says, "Shut up, Gabriel!"

159
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:36,625
And he snatches off my collar.

160
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:41,252
And then he pulls off his.
And he starts pouring.

161
00:21:41,342 --> 00:21:44,801
And then Tommy's father walks in.

162
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:47,345
And Reverend George walks over to him,

163
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:50,469
two drinks in hand...

164
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,016
and...

165
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:56,062
...he just starts talking.

166
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:00,809
He talks to everyone...

167
00:22:00,903 --> 00:22:03,361
and they're at ease.

168
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:05,655
They're smiling.

169
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:09,781
Laughing.

170
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:12,533
And he tells me, you know...

171
00:22:12,623 --> 00:22:14,205
all I have to do

172
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:15,657
is be with them,

173
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:18,289
in the moment...

174
00:22:18,379 --> 00:22:21,042
s-speak from my heart

175
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:24,249
and don't worry about what
I think they want to hear.

176
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:31,216
And I... I try, but I'm...
I'm not as good at it as he is.

177
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:35,889
And then later he tells me

178
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:40,975
that real ministering isn't
preaching from a pulpit.

179
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:44,527
It's talking to people one on one,

180
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:46,900
on their own terms.

181
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:51,947
Relating to them, you know?

182
00:22:57,293 --> 00:22:59,501
That's how I know about whiskey.

183
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:05,962
That's how I know about a lot of things.

184
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:17,556
You need to start preaching again.

185
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:19,638
No, you do.

186
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:22,566
I'm gonna be mad at you if you don't.

187
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:24,734
Listen.

188
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:27,437
When I was out there

189
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:31,821
finding people to bring to Alexandria...

190
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:34,198
that felt right.

191
00:23:35,623 --> 00:23:39,287
Helping people was right.

192
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:43,871
We haven't done that for a long time.

193
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:47,674
We've gotta get back to it.

194
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,003
I don't want to preach anymore.

195
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:53,213
Why?

196
00:23:53,307 --> 00:23:55,094
You really think

197
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:58,018
things are gonna go back
to the way they were?

198
00:24:00,356 --> 00:24:03,394
It has to.

199
00:24:03,484 --> 00:24:05,851
It won't.

200
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:12,615
The world isn't built
for the way we used to be.

201
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:14,237
You don't believe that.

202
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:19,956
Your head is all... over the Whisperers.

203
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:21,533
It's...

204
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:23,459
Who and what they were...

205
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:27,289
that is... not most people.

206
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:38,722
Evil people aren't
the exception to the rule.

207
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:40,768
They <i>are</i> the rule.

208
00:24:44,692 --> 00:24:46,729
Well. Now I'm sober.

209
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:56,154
After this next round,

210
00:24:56,245 --> 00:24:58,157
I'm gonna...

211
00:24:58,247 --> 00:25:02,958
climb up to the roof
and jump off head first.

212
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:05,456
You want me to perform your last rites?

213
00:25:05,546 --> 00:25:07,629
I'll get back to you.

214
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:11,670
Ow.

215
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,877
Sorry.

216
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:34,439
Where are you going?

217
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:36,195
To piss.

218
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:08,185
Aaron?

219
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:15,438
Aaron?!

220
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:49,939
What were you cooking?

221
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:53,818
What?

222
00:26:53,904 --> 00:26:56,817
I said...

223
00:26:56,907 --> 00:26:59,399
"What were you cooking?"

224
00:26:59,493 --> 00:27:03,032
Boar.

225
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:05,330
Boar...

226
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:06,951
How was it?

227
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:10,789
The boar.

228
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:12,871
How was it?

229
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:15,708
It was... good.

230
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:24,007
I'd like a bite.

231
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:37,611
My name is Gabriel.

232
00:27:37,698 --> 00:27:38,984
What's yours?

233
00:27:42,953 --> 00:27:44,319
I came here with a friend of mine.

234
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:45,620
Have you seen him?

235
00:27:51,295 --> 00:27:53,912
Can I ask what it is that you want?

236
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:57,044
Seems like you're the ones
that are wanting.

237
00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:02,094
Wanting to break into my place.

238
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:04,389
Eat my boar.

239
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:06,261
Drink my whiskey.

240
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:08,434
It didn't look like anyone lived here.

241
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:11,471
So you figured that boar

242
00:28:11,565 --> 00:28:13,978
got into that room by itself?

243
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:15,649
We were just looking for food.

244
00:28:15,736 --> 00:28:17,648
We meant no harm.

245
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:28,613
Does this say "no harm" to you?

246
00:28:35,631 --> 00:28:38,590
You should know that
we're part of a larger group.

247
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:40,257
More than 20 armed fighters.

248
00:28:40,344 --> 00:28:42,882
They'll be coming
if we don't get back soon.

249
00:28:45,891 --> 00:28:47,678
I don't bluff as easy as your buddy,

250
00:28:47,768 --> 00:28:49,851
in your little card game.

251
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:06,321
You think it's loaded?

252
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:09,119
Aren't a lot of bullets left in the world.

253
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:23,463
You think he made it?

254
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:25,135
What?

255
00:29:25,222 --> 00:29:27,214
Your friend.

256
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:28,423
He's in there.

257
00:29:30,978 --> 00:29:32,059
Easy.

258
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,275
Still breathing, I think.

259
00:29:47,369 --> 00:29:48,951
I want to see him.

260
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:52,123
Why do you wear that?

261
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:53,490
What?

262
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:55,916
The collar.

263
00:29:56,003 --> 00:29:57,869
Why you still wearing it?

264
00:29:57,963 --> 00:30:01,377
Probably for the same reason
you keep all those bibles.

265
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:05,843
I wear it because
the word of God still matters.

266
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:10,014
It's a light in an otherwise
very dark world.

267
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:13,343
And a reminder of the goodness
still within us.

268
00:30:13,437 --> 00:30:16,305
Things like love. Mercy.

269
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:17,639
Forgiveness...

270
00:30:17,733 --> 00:30:19,474
Toilet paper.

271
00:30:19,568 --> 00:30:21,275
What?

272
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:24,445
The bibles.

273
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:27,069
They're my toilet paper.

274
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:28,866
I like the thin pages.

275
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:31,160
And I can find them everywhere.

276
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:33,033
Maybe instead of wiping your ass with it,

277
00:30:33,123 --> 00:30:34,239
you should read it.

278
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:36,541
Yeah, I've read it.

279
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:38,208
Cover to cover.

280
00:30:38,295 --> 00:30:40,161
That's why I wipe my ass with it.

281
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,666
Must be hard,

282
00:30:45,761 --> 00:30:49,050
preaching about something
you don't believe in.

283
00:30:49,139 --> 00:30:51,347
I <i>do</i> believe.

284
00:30:51,433 --> 00:30:55,097
"Evil people aren't
the exception to the rule.

285
00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:56,598
They are the rule."

286
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:57,849
I was drunk.

287
00:30:57,939 --> 00:30:59,726
A drunk tongue's an honest one.

288
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:01,682
There's nothing left in this world

289
00:31:01,777 --> 00:31:03,518
but thieves and murderers.

290
00:31:03,612 --> 00:31:06,195
No. There's still goodness.

291
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:07,647
You just have to look for it.

292
00:31:07,741 --> 00:31:11,405
Who are you trying to convince, Padre?

293
00:31:11,495 --> 00:31:14,158
Me or you?

294
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:21,581
You're so close.

295
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:25,874
Close to what?

296
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:23,059
One round...

297
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:24,937
one in six chance...

298
00:32:35,537 --> 00:32:37,870
Well, you got a choice.

299
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:41,620
Each time, you can point it at yourself,

300
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:45,704
or the man sitting across from you.

301
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,504
Winner goes home.

302
00:32:49,259 --> 00:32:50,795
We're not doing this.

303
00:32:50,886 --> 00:32:52,718
Then you both die.

304
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:54,761
How do we know
you won't kill us both anyway?

305
00:32:54,848 --> 00:32:56,555
You don't.

306
00:32:59,186 --> 00:33:02,850
We can make this right.
Get you a new boar.

307
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:04,601
It's not about the boar.

308
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:06,273
Then what is it about?

309
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:08,191
Enlightenment.

310
00:33:10,572 --> 00:33:12,814
Now go ahead.

311
00:33:23,502 --> 00:33:25,869
Him or you, Father?

312
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:26,962
Pick.

313
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:08,957
Now you.

314
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:31,979
Why are you doing this?

315
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:36,564
What happened to your arm?

316
00:34:38,952 --> 00:34:41,569
It was crushed.

317
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:43,575
In a construction accident.

318
00:34:48,378 --> 00:34:49,869
Who blinded you?

319
00:34:49,963 --> 00:34:51,420
No one.

320
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:53,122
It was an infection.

321
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:54,548
Huh.

322
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:57,001
What? You wanted to hear
that someone plucked my eye out?

323
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:59,303
Or chopped his arm off?

324
00:34:59,389 --> 00:35:00,675
Why?

325
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:02,506
To prove how evil man is?

326
00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:04,058
That what this is about?

327
00:35:04,144 --> 00:35:05,997
You think I'm gonna shoot him,
or he's gonna shoot me?

328
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:08,809
Quiet.

329
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:12,141
Now, you pick it up and
point it at your head or his.

330
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:13,396
Now.

331
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:14,602
Now!

332
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:46,225
Did you hear that?

333
00:35:46,311 --> 00:35:49,019
Makes a different sound
when the chamber loads...

334
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:51,939
You got a choice to make, son.

335
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:00,193
We're not "thieves and murderers."

336
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:04,656
We d... We don't kill each other.

337
00:36:04,746 --> 00:36:06,908
We protect each other.

338
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:08,534
Like family.

339
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:10,491
Family?

340
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:13,248
Is that supposed to mean something?

341
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:16,376
You want to hear about family?

342
00:36:16,466 --> 00:36:18,879
When I was with my brother and his family

343
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:20,550
and we were on the road,

344
00:36:20,637 --> 00:36:23,004
and I saved their lives
more times than I can count,

345
00:36:23,098 --> 00:36:24,680
and then one day, I wake up,

346
00:36:24,766 --> 00:36:28,100
and there's my brother
stealing the last of my food.

347
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:30,929
And he just stares at me.

348
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:35,687
And then he comes at me,
with a knife and...

349
00:36:35,777 --> 00:36:38,485
What happened?

350
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:42,440
I handled it.

351
00:36:45,245 --> 00:36:47,032
But I didn't blame my brother.

352
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:53,042
'Cause he gave me something
valuable that day.

353
00:36:53,128 --> 00:36:54,915
He didn't "give" you anything.

354
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:58,338
What did you say?

355
00:36:58,425 --> 00:37:00,883
You're just trying to make sense
out of what happened to you.

356
00:37:00,969 --> 00:37:03,302
So you wall yourself off in here,

357
00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:04,845
believing that everyone left

358
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:07,719
is evil or only out for themselves.

359
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:10,426
Because it's easier to accept
than the truth.

360
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,261
That you meant less to your brother

361
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:13,436
than some scraps of food.

362
00:37:13,523 --> 00:37:14,523
Gabriel...

363
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:16,269
No. He's gonna hear this.

364
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:19,397
I know something about looking
for the meaning in things.

365
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:21,399
But most times, there isn't any.

366
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:24,778
No answers, no "grand design."

367
00:37:24,868 --> 00:37:26,554
Your brother didn't give you
any enlightenment.

368
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:28,035
Just a ripped up face.

369
00:37:28,121 --> 00:37:29,724
And you're so full of hate
that you can't see

370
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:31,308
that you're about
to murder two good people,

371
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:32,332
and for what?

372
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:33,574
To prove what?!

373
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:35,534
That you aren't different!

374
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:37,995
Yes, <i>w</i> e are.

375
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:41,332
Pull that trigger.

376
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:42,962
I said pull it!

377
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:45,669
Him or you? Who's it gonna be?

378
00:37:54,314 --> 00:37:55,475
What about Gracie?

379
00:37:58,067 --> 00:38:00,730
You want to see her again, don't you?

380
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:03,233
Well, then, you know what you gotta do.

381
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:11,453
Don't look at him.

382
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:13,576
Do you want to see
your daughter again or not?!

383
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:15,874
- Yes, I do!
- Then what are you waiting for?!

384
00:38:24,594 --> 00:38:27,928
Three! Two! One!

385
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:30,472
- Aaaaah!
- Stop!

386
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:32,971
<i>Th i s</i> is who people are!

387
00:38:33,061 --> 00:38:34,097
<i>Th i s</i> is truth!

388
00:38:34,187 --> 00:38:35,598
You're wrong.

389
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:37,270
<i>I</i> was wrong.

390
00:38:37,357 --> 00:38:38,973
People in this world are capable of more

391
00:38:39,067 --> 00:38:40,649
than just killing each other.

392
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:41,976
They still love.

393
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:43,857
Still sacrifice.

394
00:38:43,947 --> 00:38:45,984
Your brother didn't give you any truth.

395
00:38:46,074 --> 00:38:48,487
He just betrayed you.

396
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:50,096
And if you punish others for his sins,

397
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:52,699
then you're no better than him.

398
00:38:52,789 --> 00:38:56,032
Now, you weren't always like this.

399
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:58,367
None of us were.

400
00:38:58,461 --> 00:39:01,295
You have to remember who you were.

401
00:39:01,381 --> 00:39:03,373
- I know who I am!
- I do, too.

402
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:05,628
Because I know people just like you.

403
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:07,880
We both do.

404
00:39:07,971 --> 00:39:09,678
Good people,

405
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:11,505
who've been broken by this world.

406
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,431
You don't have to be like this.

407
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:15,134
There is another way.

408
00:39:15,228 --> 00:39:16,560
Our community is real.

409
00:39:16,646 --> 00:39:18,603
It's full of people who were lost

410
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:20,181
and found their way back.

411
00:39:20,275 --> 00:39:22,608
You can, too.

412
00:39:22,694 --> 00:39:24,902
We can help you.

413
00:39:24,988 --> 00:39:26,320
If you'll let us.

414
00:39:27,991 --> 00:39:30,324
Father...

415
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:32,493
I don't believe you.

416
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:34,320
You should.

417
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:43,795
Because that's who we are.

418
00:40:44,734 --> 00:40:45,895
Mays.

419
00:40:54,077 --> 00:40:56,160
My name is Mays.

420
00:41:06,923 --> 00:41:08,505
It's okay.

421
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:10,298
We're good.

422
00:41:12,929 --> 00:41:15,046
Are we?

423
00:41:16,683 --> 00:41:18,595
We couldn't take him with us.

424
00:41:18,685 --> 00:41:20,972
He killed his brother's family.

425
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:25,351
Let's just go.

426
00:41:59,434 --> 00:42:01,596
What?

427
00:42:01,686 --> 00:42:05,555
He heard everything we said last night.

428
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:07,640
Where was he hiding?

429
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:25,373
Ugh!

430
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:08,166
It's his brother.

431
00:43:12,632 --> 00:43:15,090
My family.

432
00:43:15,176 --> 00:43:17,463
He made me play.

433
00:43:17,553 --> 00:43:20,421
He made me play.

434
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:25,930
We are not going to hurt you.

435
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:55,797
Hey. Drop it...

436
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:57,545
Easy.

437
00:43:59,137 --> 00:44:01,629
We just want to help you.

438
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:03,679
Help? Help?

439
00:44:03,766 --> 00:44:05,723
Yes.

440
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:07,676
Get you out of here.

441
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:09,887
You can come with us.

442
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:15,851
Just put the gun down.

443
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:24,780
No. No... wait!

444
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:44,694
Water tower.

445
00:45:44,784 --> 00:45:47,401
Last place on the map.

446
00:45:47,495 --> 00:45:49,953
What do you think?

447
00:45:57,463 --> 00:46:00,046
One more.

447
00:46:01,305 --> 00:47:01,922
