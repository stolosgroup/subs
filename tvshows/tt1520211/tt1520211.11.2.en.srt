One day, we came across this frail old man

278
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,542
who was kneeling
by a turned-over grocery cart.

279

It was full of scavenged clothes

280
00:23:42,712 --> 00:23:44,131
he said were for his sons and daughters,

281
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:47,884
and could we help him
haul the cart back home?

282
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:53,515
And he said he'd give us food
for our trouble.

I knew that he was a liar.

But I was starving,

00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:05,861
and soon, Hershel would be.

286
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,864
So we followed him back to his house.

287
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:12,451
I held a knife to his throat
and reached in his pocket.

288
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:15,871
I pulled out the chloroform rag
he was gonna use on me.

289
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:19,791
I stuffed it in his mouth.

290
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:24,004
And then we went inside the house,

291
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:26,506
and I locked my little boy in a room,

292
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:30,177
and I went and searched the house.

293
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:36,850
There were these three

294
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:42,230
deformed...

295
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:46,985
I wouldn't call them men.

296
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:53,450

But I handled them.

298
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,333
And then the house was quiet,

299
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:05,212
except for this thudding sound

300
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:07,756
that was coming from upstairs
in the attic.

301
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:14,638
And I thought maybe they had
people tied up up there

302
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:16,932
that were trying to get free.

303
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:24,773
So I walked to a door
at the end of this hallway.

304
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:27,984
And I opened it, and I looked up,

305
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:29,736
and there was a set of stairs.

306
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:35,200
At the top of the stairs,
there's this shadow

307
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:38,828
writhing and rocking.

308
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:43,166
I thought it was an animal.

309
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:48,421
Then all of a sudden,
it fell down the stairs,

310
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:52,175
and it came right at my feet.

311
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:55,595
It was a walker

312
00:25:56,596 --> 00:25:59,266
that used to be a woman.

313
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:03,103
Her arms and her legs

314
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:08,108
had been cut off, stitched up.

315
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:12,821
Her eyes gouged out.

316
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:16,116
No tongue.

317
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:19,536
And she was wheezing

318
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:24,249
through an open, cauterized gash
in her throat

319
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:27,877
where her vocal cords had been ripped out.

320
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:34,217
And her belly was round and full.

321
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:39,306
And whatever was inside of there
was trying to get out.

322
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:43,977
And I went upstairs,
and there were three more just like her.

323
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:48,440
But their hearts were still beating.

324
00:26:51,651 --> 00:26:53,987
And do you know the first thing I thought?

325
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:58,742
The very first thing that crossed my mind?

328
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:10,045
So I took care of them.

329
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:13,465
And then I found the food.

330

Lots of it.

331
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:20,930

the cart with it, and we left.

Because that is what's out there.

335
00:27:45,872 --> 00:27:47,874
And seeing it, I lost something.

336

it's a bad thing that I did.

So I got my friends

469
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:26,043
to go to that train yard under the guise

470
00:42:26,126 --> 00:42:28,087
of asking whoever showed up
for help for us three,

471
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:30,631
because I knew they wouldn't go otherwise.

472
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:35,803
But all I was thinking about
was Stephanie.

00:42:37,179 --> 00:42:40,975
So yes, I lied.

474
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:43,227

because I'm afraid to lose

the three friends I have in this world.

476
00:42:46,438 --> 00:42:48,899
And I lied to Stephanie about
being from a large settlement

477
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:51,277
because I was afraid that maybe,

478
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,571
she was not who she said she was.

479
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:55,656
That maybe she was a femme fatale,

480
00:42:56,949 --> 00:42:59,034
laying a trap for a lonely heart.

481
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:04,373
My track record in the romantic realm
is spotty at best.

482
00:43:04,456 --> 00:43:07,751
I'm not one for whom
any relationships come easy,

483
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:10,170
particularly those with the fairer sex.

484
00:43:13,507 --> 00:43:15,217
And I am, in fact, a virgin.

485
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:19,888
Even though I have, uh, observed the act

486
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:22,016
far more times than I care to admit.

489
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:35,154
that after a suitable period of courtship,

490
00:43:35,237 --> 00:43:38,866
that Stephanie might be the one
to change my unenviable status,

491
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:41,076
because deep down,
I was hoping that maybe, in fact,

492
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,287
she was my One True Love.

493

And now I've been forced to
admit that in this room,

494
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:47,875

(CRYING) And...

496
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,300
I'm afraid that if Stephanie finds out
that I wasn't honest with her, either,

497
00:43:56,383 --> 00:43:59,678
that she might want to have
nothing to do with me anymore.

So here I am,

499
00:44:06,935 --> 00:44:09,146
very relieved to get that off my chest.

500
00:44:10,939 --> 00:44:12,775
Because everything else
I've said up to this point

has been the goddamn truth.

I thought... Where'd they take you?

509
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,184
An infirmary.

510
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:32,980
A medic steamed my face,
gave me this nasty herbal cough syrup,

511
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:35,566
and I slept.

512
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:37,860
They spiked the cough syrup?

513
00:45:37,943 --> 00:45:39,945
No, no. They took the lantern
out of my room,

514
00:45:40,028 --> 00:45:41,321
and I fell asleep.

Medic checked on me a couple of times,

516

and then they took us

517
00:45:45,534 --> 00:45:48,078
to a holding room with Princess,
and then they brought us here.

Yeah. Thank God you're here, too.
