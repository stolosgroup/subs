1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
We beat the Whisperers

3
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,499
after a long fight
and too many losses.

4
00:00:21,543 --> 00:00:22,674
-Aah!

5
00:00:22,718 --> 00:00:24,198
We got Maggie back.

6
00:00:24,241 --> 00:00:26,156
Things were looking up.

7
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,898
But it didn't last.

8
00:00:28,941 --> 00:00:30,682
We were attacked in the woods.

9
00:00:30,726 --> 00:00:32,684
Hunted.

10
00:00:32,728 --> 00:00:35,078
All that damage from one guy.

11
00:00:35,122 --> 00:00:38,038
Took some effort,
but we brought him down.

12
00:00:39,909 --> 00:00:41,041
He ain't the last.

13
00:00:41,084 --> 00:00:42,346
There's more.

14
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:44,348
And Maggie's got history with
him.

15
00:00:44,392 --> 00:00:46,089
Does this mean
you're coming home?

16
00:00:46,133 --> 00:00:49,092
She's scared, but,
she won't say why.

17
00:00:49,136 --> 00:00:51,964
When we finally got home,
it was trashed.

18
00:00:52,008 --> 00:00:53,357
Whisperers.

19
00:00:53,401 --> 00:00:55,577
Walls were damaged,
food destroyed.

20
00:00:58,275 --> 00:00:59,275
We've got work to do.

21
00:01:44,278 --> 00:01:47,150
Hi.

22
00:01:47,194 --> 00:01:48,997
Did I ever tell you about
the pedal sewing machine

23
00:01:49,021 --> 00:01:50,240
my grandmother had?

24
00:01:50,284 --> 00:01:51,763
She made all my clothes.

25
00:01:51,807 --> 00:01:54,244
Whenever she got tired,
she'd have me help.

26
00:01:54,288 --> 00:01:58,422
Said it was 'cause I
had a really special,
strong right foot.

27
00:01:58,466 --> 00:02:00,772
I got it.

28
00:02:02,296 --> 00:02:04,950
There's a fallen tree
about 100 yards out.

29
00:02:04,994 --> 00:02:08,258
We could use the scraps,
maybe patch out the wall.

30
00:02:08,302 --> 00:02:10,521
Done with my part for the day.

31
00:02:10,565 --> 00:02:12,175
Jerry's spearheading the rest.

32
00:02:12,219 --> 00:02:13,892
You know, he's taking charge
a lot more lately.

33
00:02:13,916 --> 00:02:15,787
I like it.

34
00:02:15,831 --> 00:02:18,268
Yeah. So?

35
00:02:18,312 --> 00:02:20,444
So what?

36
00:02:20,488 --> 00:02:22,185
You followed me out here.

37
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:25,145
Nobody's following anybody,
Daryl.

38
00:02:25,188 --> 00:02:28,670
But you wanna come, right?

39
00:02:28,713 --> 00:02:32,456
I wanna hunt whatever's still
left out there to hunt, yeah,

40
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,284
and you need a good spotter.

41
00:02:35,764 --> 00:02:39,463
Whoo!

42
00:02:39,507 --> 00:02:41,291
Hey, I didn't say
you could come.

43
00:02:41,335 --> 00:02:42,814
Scoot.

44
00:02:42,858 --> 00:02:45,165
You scoot back.
I'm the one steering.

45
00:02:49,038 --> 00:02:52,998
Ready? Mm-hmm.

46
00:02:53,042 --> 00:02:55,697
Do me a favor and not talk
the whole time we're out here.

47
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:58,221
I'm not gonna spook the animals.
Don't worry.

48
00:02:58,265 --> 00:03:00,112
- I ain't worried.
- Well, why'd you
bring it up?

49
00:03:00,136 --> 00:03:03,008
Oh, my God.
This is what I'm talking about.

50
00:03:03,052 --> 00:03:05,185
You're the one
who started talking.

51
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:00,370
Here you go.

52
00:04:00,414 --> 00:04:02,633
Here, Dog. Don't get greedy.

53
00:04:02,677 --> 00:04:05,723
Hey, come on.
He don't need all that.

54
00:04:05,767 --> 00:04:08,552
Alright, we got five miles
due southeast of the gate.

55
00:04:08,596 --> 00:04:10,250
It's right near that, uh...

56
00:04:10,293 --> 00:04:11,923
Small fork in the road
by the dying white oak.

57
00:04:11,947 --> 00:04:13,383
Right. Got it.

58
00:04:13,427 --> 00:04:15,864
- Stay close.
- That's all I'm saying.

59
00:04:15,907 --> 00:04:18,997
This close enough?

60
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:22,740
Just remember this spot in
casewe get split up, alright?

61
00:04:22,784 --> 00:04:24,394
I'm not going anywhere.

62
00:04:24,438 --> 00:04:27,745
- Promise.
- Alright.

63
00:04:27,789 --> 00:04:30,139
Good boy.

64
00:04:30,182 --> 00:04:31,793
Here we go.

65
00:04:34,143 --> 00:04:36,667
I could do venison tonight.

66
00:04:46,982 --> 00:04:49,637
Well, any other deer
areprobably long gone by now.

67
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,596
What if we try the, uh,
big valley up north?

68
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,295
I was thinking about the river.

69
00:04:55,338 --> 00:04:57,514
Yeah?

70
00:04:57,558 --> 00:05:00,648
You good with that?

71
00:05:00,691 --> 00:05:04,042
Yeah. Let's do it.

72
00:05:04,086 --> 00:05:06,654
Alright. Come on.

73
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,183
Ow. Ow.

74
00:05:14,226 --> 00:05:15,880
You alright? Shit.

75
00:05:15,924 --> 00:05:17,360
Yeah, I'm fine. It's nothing.

76
00:05:17,404 --> 00:05:19,797
It's just a foot cramp.

77
00:05:19,841 --> 00:05:23,018
It's not your very special,
strong right foot, now, is it?

78
00:05:24,889 --> 00:05:27,675
No, it's fine.
Just give me a minute.

79
00:05:27,718 --> 00:05:29,372
There's not much
happening out here.

80
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:31,026
Maybe you were right.

81
00:05:31,069 --> 00:05:33,333
Maybe we should've gonethe other way.

82
00:05:33,376 --> 00:05:35,857
Well, I think we should fish
before moving on.

83
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,163
Doesn't look like
they're running.

84
00:05:38,207 --> 00:05:41,253
Worth a shot.

85
00:05:41,297 --> 00:05:43,604
Haven't spear-fished in years.

86
00:05:45,867 --> 00:05:47,912
- What, you don't think I can?
- Gimme that.

87
00:05:47,956 --> 00:05:49,697
Be my guest.

88
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,313
Uh-huh.

89
00:06:00,229 --> 00:06:02,710
Watch this disaster right here.

90
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:08,542
Ha!

91
00:06:08,585 --> 00:06:10,021
No way. Oh!

92
00:06:12,154 --> 00:06:15,026
That's beginner's luck.

93
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:17,072
I'm gonna get another one.

94
00:06:31,565 --> 00:06:33,784
Just say it. What?

95
00:06:33,828 --> 00:06:35,699
You don't think
I'm doing this right.

96
00:06:35,743 --> 00:06:37,745
Try cutting closer to the bone.

97
00:06:37,788 --> 00:06:39,877
Like that.

98
00:06:39,921 --> 00:06:42,402
I've filleted a fish
before, Daryl.

99
00:06:42,445 --> 00:06:44,055
Alright.

100
00:06:48,756 --> 00:06:51,236
Here. Why don't you just
do this yourself?

101
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,762
It's fine, really.

102
00:06:54,805 --> 00:06:57,939
We should go.
It's gonna get dark anyway.

103
00:06:57,982 --> 00:07:01,725
Need to find a place to stay.

104
00:07:01,769 --> 00:07:03,988
Hey, Daryl? Yeah?

105
00:07:05,947 --> 00:07:08,993
Think our luck's run out?

106
00:07:09,037 --> 00:07:11,474
What do you mean?

107
00:07:11,518 --> 00:07:15,478
Losing Hilltop was so hard
for everyone to take.

108
00:07:15,522 --> 00:07:17,959
But at least we were there
to fight for it.

109
00:07:18,002 --> 00:07:20,178
We tried to save it. But this?

110
00:07:20,222 --> 00:07:22,093
Losing... Losing Alexandria?

111
00:07:22,137 --> 00:07:24,574
We didn't lose Alexandria.

112
00:07:24,618 --> 00:07:27,925
Maybe not yet.

113
00:07:29,797 --> 00:07:31,842
It feels different.

114
00:07:31,886 --> 00:07:33,757
Like everything
that's good in the world

115
00:07:33,801 --> 00:07:36,760
is not on our side anymore.

116
00:07:40,024 --> 00:07:43,332
We rebuild. We start over.

117
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:47,684
Until it happens again.

118
00:07:47,728 --> 00:07:50,470
We've had a good, long run.
Longer than most.

119
00:07:52,994 --> 00:07:56,476
But we know this world.

120
00:07:56,519 --> 00:08:00,218
The dead.

121
00:08:00,262 --> 00:08:02,699
It's gonna catch up to us
eventually.

122
00:08:05,659 --> 00:08:08,792
Only if we let it.

123
00:08:08,836 --> 00:08:11,316
I ain't gonna let it.

124
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,144
Daryl.

125
00:08:13,188 --> 00:08:14,624
Let's go. Come on.

126
00:08:18,846 --> 00:08:20,238
Another animal?

127
00:08:20,282 --> 00:08:22,153
I don't know. Dog. Dog!

128
00:08:29,596 --> 00:08:30,988
Dog!

129
00:08:40,955 --> 00:08:42,391
Dog!

130
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:04,718
Coming?

131
00:10:00,643 --> 00:10:03,733
We could stay the night here.
Seal up that door.

132
00:11:37,566 --> 00:11:39,829
Where'd you come from? Huh?

133
00:11:39,873 --> 00:11:41,048
Oh-ho!

134
00:12:35,624 --> 00:12:38,061
Hey.

135
00:12:38,105 --> 00:12:40,585
What's going on?

136
00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:42,196
Nothing.

137
00:12:43,545 --> 00:12:46,635
You sure?

138
00:12:46,678 --> 00:12:49,333
It doesn't matter.

139
00:12:49,377 --> 00:12:51,640
I don't know.
Things are just different.

140
00:12:51,683 --> 00:12:53,511
I don't know. Different how?

141
00:12:53,555 --> 00:12:54,948
Harder.

142
00:12:54,991 --> 00:12:57,472
Harder to talk, harder to trade.

143
00:12:57,515 --> 00:12:59,126
Maggie left Hilltop.

144
00:12:59,169 --> 00:13:01,693
She took Hershel
and went with Georgie.

145
00:13:01,737 --> 00:13:03,957
Why?

146
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,828
She's on her own journey now,
I guess.

147
00:13:05,872 --> 00:13:07,395
Like you.

148
00:13:09,223 --> 00:13:12,792
You know I gotta do this, right?

149
00:13:12,835 --> 00:13:14,315
I know.

150
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,841
How's Michonne? How's the kids?

151
00:13:18,885 --> 00:13:20,843
I don't know. Daryl...

152
00:13:20,887 --> 00:13:22,714
Just give her more time.
She ain't ready yet.

153
00:13:22,758 --> 00:13:24,368
Daryl, it's been two years.

154
00:13:24,412 --> 00:13:27,937
How long do you plan
to stay out here?

155
00:13:27,981 --> 00:13:29,373
I don't know.

156
00:13:29,417 --> 00:13:31,288
As long as it takes, I guess.

157
00:13:31,332 --> 00:13:32,942
Anything turn up?

158
00:13:32,986 --> 00:13:35,118
There's a spot up the river
I haven't checked yet.

159
00:13:38,905 --> 00:13:41,821
I do understand, you know.

160
00:13:41,864 --> 00:13:45,346
I know.

161
00:13:45,389 --> 00:13:48,871
And if it weren't for
Ezekiel and Henry

162
00:13:48,915 --> 00:13:51,874
and everything going on
back at the Kingdom, I would...

163
00:13:51,918 --> 00:13:54,181
I know that, too.

164
00:13:54,224 --> 00:13:55,225
Things are just...

165
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:57,749
Different. I get it.

166
00:14:00,274 --> 00:14:03,451
I should go.
There's a storm coming.

167
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:11,720
Thanks.

168
00:14:11,763 --> 00:14:14,854
Be careful.

169
00:14:14,897 --> 00:14:16,812
I will.

170
00:15:50,906 --> 00:15:52,299
No!

171
00:17:09,245 --> 00:17:11,073
What is it, boy? Come on.

172
00:17:16,774 --> 00:17:19,386
What is it, boy? Boy?

173
00:17:36,229 --> 00:17:38,274
Who the hell are you?

174
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:43,540
I asked you a question.

175
00:17:43,584 --> 00:17:45,194
I'm leaving.

176
00:17:47,718 --> 00:17:49,372
No, you're not.

177
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:02,211
Is that the spot? Oh, yeah.

178
00:18:02,255 --> 00:18:05,127
Is that the spot, buddy?

179
00:18:05,171 --> 00:18:09,131
Find food, boy? Hmm?

180
00:18:09,175 --> 00:18:12,091
Or you just nuts?

181
00:18:12,134 --> 00:18:14,745
Yeah, good boy.

182
00:18:14,789 --> 00:18:16,399
Yeah.

183
00:18:16,443 --> 00:18:18,749
Oh, yeah, that's the spot.

184
00:18:41,468 --> 00:18:45,167
She lived here?

185
00:18:45,211 --> 00:18:47,300
It was a long time ago.

186
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:09,191
I already told you everything.

187
00:19:09,235 --> 00:19:12,281
No, you didn't.

188
00:19:12,325 --> 00:19:15,197
What else you wanna know?

189
00:19:15,241 --> 00:19:17,199
Whatever you wanna tell me.

190
00:20:04,768 --> 00:20:07,293
Bad idea.

191
00:20:09,295 --> 00:20:11,732
You gonna kill me? Should I?

192
00:20:16,432 --> 00:20:18,521
That's what I thought.

193
00:20:22,917 --> 00:20:25,224
Something tells me
you don't really wanna die.

194
00:20:25,267 --> 00:20:26,399
Not today, anyway.

195
00:20:26,442 --> 00:20:27,637
You don't know
anything about me.

196
00:20:27,661 --> 00:20:29,706
You're right.

197
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:33,275
I don't.

198
00:20:33,319 --> 00:20:35,364
So let me ask you again.

199
00:20:39,977 --> 00:20:43,067
Who the hell are you?

200
00:20:43,111 --> 00:20:47,637
And what are you doing
out here on my land?

201
00:20:47,681 --> 00:20:50,161
My name's Daryl.

202
00:20:50,205 --> 00:20:53,077
And I didn't come here
looking for any trouble.

203
00:20:53,121 --> 00:20:54,949
Your dog found me.

204
00:20:54,992 --> 00:20:57,256
I was just trying to help.

205
00:20:59,345 --> 00:21:01,390
You're tied up in my cabin

206
00:21:01,434 --> 00:21:04,741
with a 12-gauge
pointed at your head.

207
00:21:04,785 --> 00:21:07,440
What kind of help
you think I need?

208
00:21:07,483 --> 00:21:08,919
Daryl?

209
00:21:52,876 --> 00:21:54,965
You're letting me go?

210
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,362
Get out.

211
00:22:00,406 --> 00:22:02,451
Before I change my mind.

212
00:22:21,731 --> 00:22:24,081
You gonna tell me your name?

213
00:22:25,909 --> 00:22:27,737
No.

214
00:23:00,814 --> 00:23:02,598
Hi.

215
00:23:05,166 --> 00:23:06,646
Where you been?

216
00:23:26,187 --> 00:23:27,797
Thanks for bringing him back.

217
00:23:27,841 --> 00:23:29,756
Come here, boy!

218
00:23:36,937 --> 00:23:38,155
He likes you.

219
00:23:38,199 --> 00:23:39,418
Eh, he's just a dog.

220
00:23:39,461 --> 00:23:42,551
He don't know any better.

221
00:23:42,595 --> 00:23:44,423
Yeah, well...

222
00:23:44,466 --> 00:23:46,468
Since you won't tell me
your name,

223
00:23:46,512 --> 00:23:48,427
what about his?

224
00:23:51,604 --> 00:23:52,605
Dog.

225
00:23:52,648 --> 00:23:54,302
Dog?

226
00:23:54,345 --> 00:23:55,738
That's it? Just Dog?

227
00:23:55,782 --> 00:23:56,957
You got something better?

228
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,089
Nah.

229
00:23:59,133 --> 00:24:01,831
At least you won't forget
what he is.

230
00:24:05,531 --> 00:24:08,142
Looks like you got the raw end
of the deal there.

231
00:24:11,406 --> 00:24:14,453
- Maybe.
- It's not for everyone,
you know?

232
00:24:14,496 --> 00:24:18,805
Living out in the wild,
facing the dead.

233
00:24:18,848 --> 00:24:22,330
I guess it'll catch up
to all of us one way or another.

234
00:24:22,373 --> 00:24:24,463
Only if you let it.

235
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:32,558
I'm gonna go.

236
00:24:36,387 --> 00:24:38,215
Well, be careful out there.

237
00:24:38,259 --> 00:24:40,000
Dog, inside.

238
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:07,478
You need to stay away
from my camp.

239
00:26:15,617 --> 00:26:18,098
Name's Leah.

240
00:26:59,356 --> 00:27:02,664
I can catch my own damn fish.

241
00:27:02,708 --> 00:27:05,667
Why you always
throwing stuff at me?

242
00:27:05,711 --> 00:27:07,321
I was trying to be nice.

243
00:27:07,364 --> 00:27:09,647
I don't need you to be nice.
I don't need you to be anything.

244
00:27:09,671 --> 00:27:12,195
I wanna be left the hell alone.

245
00:27:14,241 --> 00:27:18,158
Won't bother you again.

246
00:27:18,201 --> 00:27:19,638
And I won't come around again.

247
00:27:19,681 --> 00:27:20,813
Good.

248
00:27:20,856 --> 00:27:23,946
Great.

249
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:25,513
Bye.

250
00:27:31,998 --> 00:27:34,174
Thought you were going.

251
00:27:36,393 --> 00:27:38,352
I am.

252
00:27:41,181 --> 00:27:43,836
I get it, you know?

253
00:27:43,879 --> 00:27:47,796
Being out here by yourself.

254
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:51,800
You been out here alone
for a long time, too, huh?

255
00:27:51,844 --> 00:27:53,933
Lost track a long time ago.

256
00:27:58,241 --> 00:28:00,069
That's frostnip?

257
00:28:00,113 --> 00:28:03,812
I had it before.
It ain't no big deal.

258
00:28:03,856 --> 00:28:05,727
No big deal till you lose
a couple fingers

259
00:28:05,771 --> 00:28:07,381
or a whole hand.

260
00:28:10,732 --> 00:28:12,908
Come on.

261
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:51,077
It's his birthday today.

262
00:29:05,526 --> 00:29:09,225
I didn't have a family
growing up.

263
00:29:09,269 --> 00:29:13,229
Not the good kind, anyway.

264
00:29:13,273 --> 00:29:15,754
So I knew I'd have to
find my own way,

265
00:29:15,797 --> 00:29:18,234
my own family,

266
00:29:18,278 --> 00:29:20,889
and I found that with my squad.

267
00:29:20,933 --> 00:29:24,675
We fought side-by-side
for years.

268
00:29:24,719 --> 00:29:26,939
When the world went to hell,
we swore to stay together,

269
00:29:26,982 --> 00:29:30,899
to fight together.

270
00:29:30,943 --> 00:29:35,948
They gave me hope, and...

271
00:29:35,991 --> 00:29:38,777
I tried to give that to my son.

272
00:29:46,959 --> 00:29:50,440
Matthew was my son.

273
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:58,797
I didn't give birth to him,
but he was mine.

274
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,277
He was born to my sister.

275
00:30:03,845 --> 00:30:08,807
That's what I called her,
anyway.

276
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:12,941
I lost her when he was born.

277
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:19,165
This doesn't matter.

278
00:30:19,208 --> 00:30:21,297
He's gone.

279
00:31:20,226 --> 00:31:22,706
I held Matthew tight.

280
00:31:25,927 --> 00:31:29,800
Dog's mama was next to me.

281
00:31:29,844 --> 00:31:34,370
She was pregnant.

282
00:31:34,414 --> 00:31:37,069
The dead came from all sides.

283
00:31:37,112 --> 00:31:40,724
There was so...

284
00:31:40,768 --> 00:31:45,251
screaming and so much blood.

285
00:31:45,294 --> 00:31:48,602
I...

286
00:31:48,645 --> 00:31:51,083
got separated from my family,
and I ran.

287
00:31:51,126 --> 00:31:55,914
I... I felt like I ran forever,

288
00:31:55,957 --> 00:32:00,744
then I ended up here,
and I saw my boy was bit.

289
00:32:15,324 --> 00:32:19,241
I said goodbye to him
the same day Dog was born.

290
00:32:24,116 --> 00:32:28,424
I haven't seen another soul
out here since.

291
00:32:39,131 --> 00:32:43,962
Not till you came along.

292
00:32:50,316 --> 00:32:52,361
Who'd you lose?

293
00:32:55,756 --> 00:32:59,455
My brother.

294
00:32:59,499 --> 00:33:01,805
How?

295
00:33:01,849 --> 00:33:05,113
It was an accident.

296
00:33:05,157 --> 00:33:07,637
Never found the body.

297
00:33:07,681 --> 00:33:12,164
And you think
he's still out there?

298
00:33:12,207 --> 00:33:16,124
I don't know.

299
00:33:16,168 --> 00:33:19,301
But I'm not gonna stop
till I find out.

300
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:28,136
Always the hero, huh?

301
00:33:32,358 --> 00:33:33,576
What?

302
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:36,927
First try. Told you.

303
00:33:36,971 --> 00:33:39,669
Ha! That was a lucky shot.

304
00:33:39,713 --> 00:33:41,367
Mm!

305
00:33:43,456 --> 00:33:45,849
Let's get another one.

306
00:33:45,893 --> 00:33:47,329
Yah!

307
00:33:47,373 --> 00:33:49,027
What?

308
00:34:04,216 --> 00:34:06,522
Beautiful, huh?

309
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:56,920
You ain't gonna talk to me?

310
00:35:14,808 --> 00:35:18,116
It's only gonna be
for a few days.

311
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:21,031
Where do you belong, Daryl?

312
00:35:21,075 --> 00:35:22,946
Out there in the river,

313
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:26,472
looking for your dead brother,
day after day after day?

314
00:35:26,515 --> 00:35:28,996
Or do you belong
with the family you left

315
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:30,867
because it was too hard
to face what happened?

316
00:35:30,911 --> 00:35:33,653
Or do you belong here with me?

317
00:35:38,701 --> 00:35:42,183
I don't know.

318
00:35:44,533 --> 00:35:46,361
Yeah, you do.

319
00:35:49,321 --> 00:35:51,366
Now choose.

320
00:36:16,957 --> 00:36:19,002
Hm.

321
00:36:19,046 --> 00:36:21,004
Happy to see you, too.

322
00:36:21,048 --> 00:36:23,703
Ah, sorry. I'm just busy.

323
00:36:23,746 --> 00:36:25,357
What's up?

324
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,836
Was gonna ask you
the same thing.

325
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,316
Does this mean
you're coming back?

326
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,013
Nah, just moving.

327
00:36:30,057 --> 00:36:33,495
Too many dead around here.

328
00:36:33,539 --> 00:36:35,367
Here.

329
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:37,412
Just couldn't stand the thought
of you wearing

330
00:36:37,456 --> 00:36:39,936
that ratty old thing anymore.

331
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:43,679
You gonna tell me
why you really came?

332
00:36:43,723 --> 00:36:46,465
What?
Can't I bring a friend a gift?

333
00:36:51,818 --> 00:36:54,516
I came because
I wanted to tell you

334
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:58,259
that it... it might be a while
before I come back.

335
00:36:58,303 --> 00:37:00,740
Okay.

336
00:37:00,783 --> 00:37:02,568
Things are really tough
at the Kingdom

337
00:37:02,611 --> 00:37:06,746
and Ezekiel needs me there,
and Henry, too.

338
00:37:06,789 --> 00:37:09,444
You asking for my permission?

339
00:37:09,488 --> 00:37:11,533
-No.
-You don't need
to ask my permission

340
00:37:11,577 --> 00:37:14,406
to move on with your life.

341
00:37:14,449 --> 00:37:16,277
That's not what this is about.
I just w...

342
00:37:16,321 --> 00:37:21,108
You want me to move on
with mine, right?

343
00:37:21,151 --> 00:37:24,242
I want you to find some peace.

344
00:37:24,285 --> 00:37:27,157
I don't wanna lose you
out here, okay?

345
00:37:27,201 --> 00:37:29,092
I don't wanna lose you
because you can't figure out

346
00:37:29,116 --> 00:37:30,987
when to stop.

347
00:37:35,122 --> 00:37:39,431
I'm glad you found your peace.

348
00:37:39,474 --> 00:37:42,564
You ain't gonna lose me,
alright?

349
00:37:42,608 --> 00:37:44,784
I just got stuff to do.

350
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:36,792
Leah.

351
00:38:43,364 --> 00:38:45,148
Leah?

352
00:38:52,199 --> 00:38:53,809
Aw, hey.

353
00:38:53,853 --> 00:38:55,463
Yeah, good boy.

354
00:39:25,058 --> 00:39:26,929
Come on, boy. Come on.

355
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:44,077
Don't worry, boy.
We're gonna get her back.

356
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,948
Come on.

357
00:39:48,908 --> 00:39:51,389
I should've been there.

358
00:39:51,432 --> 00:39:53,869
I could've helped her.

359
00:39:53,913 --> 00:39:57,438
Do you think she's still alive?

360
00:39:57,482 --> 00:40:01,224
I don't know.

361
00:40:01,268 --> 00:40:03,792
Maybe somebody took her?

362
00:40:03,836 --> 00:40:05,228
I don't know.

363
00:40:05,272 --> 00:40:09,407
Is it possible that
sh-she just left?

364
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:10,538
What?

365
00:40:10,582 --> 00:40:12,801
It's not an accusation.

366
00:40:12,845 --> 00:40:14,890
Nah, I walked away.

367
00:40:14,934 --> 00:40:16,544
You didn't walk away, Daryl.

368
00:40:16,588 --> 00:40:18,459
I did. I was down by that river.

369
00:40:18,503 --> 00:40:20,722
Stop thinking that
every time you lose someone

370
00:40:20,766 --> 00:40:23,246
it's because of you,
something you did wrong.

371
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:24,596
I made a mistake.

372
00:40:24,639 --> 00:40:26,728
We all make mistakes.

373
00:40:26,772 --> 00:40:30,253
Losing Leah, that's not on you.

374
00:40:30,297 --> 00:40:31,907
Neither is Rick.

375
00:40:31,951 --> 00:40:33,561
Or Connie.

376
00:40:36,782 --> 00:40:40,655
No, that's on you.

377
00:40:40,699 --> 00:40:45,486
'Cause you never know
when to stop.

378
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:47,967
I'm sorry for Connie.

379
00:40:53,494 --> 00:40:55,278
But I'm not sorry
for going after the horde,

380
00:40:55,322 --> 00:40:57,977
and I'm not sorry for making
Alpha pay for killing Henry,

381
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:59,848
'cause I was right.

382
00:40:59,892 --> 00:41:01,763
And that's all that matters,

383
00:41:01,807 --> 00:41:04,287
you being right, huh?

384
00:41:12,426 --> 00:41:14,646
This isn't just about Leah.

385
00:41:14,689 --> 00:41:16,691
Or Connie.
Or anyone else, is it?

386
00:41:16,735 --> 00:41:20,652
Why don't you just say
what you wanna say?

387
00:41:20,695 --> 00:41:22,349
You shouldn't have come.

388
00:41:22,392 --> 00:41:24,220
Hunting?

389
00:41:24,264 --> 00:41:25,483
I wanted to help.

390
00:41:25,526 --> 00:41:27,789
No, you wanted to run,

391
00:41:27,833 --> 00:41:29,225
so you ran.

392
00:41:29,269 --> 00:41:30,488
What?

393
00:41:30,531 --> 00:41:32,359
Alexandria. What the skins did.

394
00:41:32,402 --> 00:41:34,622
You couldn't deal
with the guilt,

395
00:41:34,666 --> 00:41:36,319
so you made it my problem.

396
00:41:36,363 --> 00:41:39,235
Your only problem is thinking
you have to save everybody.

397
00:41:39,279 --> 00:41:41,977
I don't need a savior, Daryl,
and I don't need a martyr.

398
00:41:42,021 --> 00:41:43,501
I just need a friend.

399
00:41:43,544 --> 00:41:45,546
Friends don't have
the same damn conversation

400
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:47,026
over and over again.

401
00:41:47,069 --> 00:41:48,351
Oh, is that
what's happening here?

402
00:41:48,375 --> 00:41:49,550
'Cause this is new to me.

403
00:41:49,594 --> 00:41:50,986
It's what <i>been</i> happening.

404
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:52,640
I'm sick of it.

405
00:41:52,684 --> 00:41:56,209
Well, then you should've just
let me get back on the boat.

406
00:41:59,604 --> 00:42:02,041
I should've.

407
00:42:02,084 --> 00:42:05,871
I stopped you from running,
and I shouldn't have.

408
00:42:07,916 --> 00:42:11,659
Wanna run? Run.

409
00:42:11,703 --> 00:42:16,011
I know where I'm supposed to be.

410
00:42:16,055 --> 00:42:18,536
I won't stop you this time.

411
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:34,552
And I was right.

412
00:42:36,336 --> 00:42:38,599
Our luck's run out, you and me.

413
00:42:38,643 --> 00:42:40,775
It's gonna be dark soon.

414
00:42:40,819 --> 00:42:43,299
I'm gonna fix the door.

415
00:43:17,551 --> 00:43:19,597
This episode is called
"Find Me,"

416
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:23,644
and the title comes from
the note that Daryl writes

417
00:43:23,688 --> 00:43:25,428
at the very end of the episode.

418
00:43:25,472 --> 00:43:28,736
He made a choice in that he
feels that he belongs with Leah.

419
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:31,347
He hopes that she comes back,
and, you know,

420
00:43:31,391 --> 00:43:34,960
he leaves a little map
to where his camp might be.

421
00:43:35,003 --> 00:43:37,179
And there's just
this kind of sense

422
00:43:37,223 --> 00:43:41,662
of incompleteness and longing
that I think is in those words,

423
00:43:41,706 --> 00:43:45,187
and so that's part of the vibe
of this episode.

424
00:43:45,231 --> 00:43:48,756
It's all about memory and
things that are not resolved,

425
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,933
and so I think that was
kind of a fitting title

426
00:43:51,977 --> 00:43:53,631
for what this episode is.

427
00:43:53,674 --> 00:43:56,372
Did I ever tell you about
the pedal sewing machine

428
00:43:56,416 --> 00:43:57,635
my grandmother had?

429
00:43:57,678 --> 00:43:59,114
She made all my clothes.

430
00:43:59,158 --> 00:44:01,639
Whenever she got tired,
she'd have me help.

431
00:44:01,682 --> 00:44:04,119
Said it was 'cause I
had a really special,
strong right foot.

432
00:44:04,163 --> 00:44:06,644
I got it.

433
00:44:08,515 --> 00:44:11,823
We wanted to start the episode
in kind of a fun way,

434
00:44:11,866 --> 00:44:14,173
make it feel like,
"Oh, like, Daryl and Carol,

435
00:44:14,216 --> 00:44:15,696
after being at odds,

436
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:18,177
maybe they're kind of back
to where they were.

437
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:20,222
Maybe it's even better
than it was."

438
00:44:20,266 --> 00:44:21,833
Hey, I didn't say
you could come.

439
00:44:21,876 --> 00:44:23,486
Scoot.

440
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:25,314
You scoot back.
I'm the one steering.

441
00:44:25,358 --> 00:44:27,229
There's still
a little bit of conflict,

442
00:44:27,273 --> 00:44:29,667
and I think that just the fun
that they're having

443
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:33,061
in many of the early scenes
is masking that a little bit,

444
00:44:33,105 --> 00:44:36,238
which I think is really true
to how friendships can work.

445
00:44:36,282 --> 00:44:37,587
You alright?

446
00:44:37,631 --> 00:44:39,024
Yeah, I'm fine. It's nothing.

447
00:44:39,067 --> 00:44:41,504
It's just a foot cramp.

448
00:44:41,548 --> 00:44:44,682
It's not your very special,
strong right foot, now, is it?

449
00:44:44,725 --> 00:44:47,032
We just wanted to start tonally
in a place

450
00:44:47,075 --> 00:44:49,861
that felt a little bit different
than we've been in for a while.

451
00:44:51,384 --> 00:44:52,602
Ha!

452
00:44:52,646 --> 00:44:54,082
No way. Oh!

453
00:44:54,126 --> 00:44:56,171
That's beginner's luck.

454
00:44:56,215 --> 00:44:58,391
Carol's got a lot on her mind.

455
00:44:58,434 --> 00:45:01,263
She's trying to grapple with
where their group is

456
00:45:01,307 --> 00:45:03,396
sort of in the history
of the apocalypse.

457
00:45:03,439 --> 00:45:06,007
Think our luck's run out?

458
00:45:06,051 --> 00:45:07,835
What do you mean?

459
00:45:07,879 --> 00:45:10,708
Were there too many lines that
were crossed during this war?

460
00:45:10,751 --> 00:45:12,535
Like,
can they come back from it?

461
00:45:12,579 --> 00:45:14,102
I think she's wondering a lot

462
00:45:14,146 --> 00:45:16,191
about those things for herself,
as well.

463
00:45:16,235 --> 00:45:18,672
It's gonna catch up to us
eventually.

464
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,544
Only if we let it.

465
00:45:21,588 --> 00:45:23,590
There's an interesting aspect
of Daryl.

466
00:45:23,633 --> 00:45:27,594
When other people are kind of
going down this dark path,

467
00:45:27,637 --> 00:45:31,729
his instinct is to try to
pull them back from the abyss.

468
00:45:33,252 --> 00:45:36,908
We are always looking for those,
like, little parallels

469
00:45:36,951 --> 00:45:39,084
between the past and the present
in this episode,

470
00:45:39,127 --> 00:45:41,739
so there's, like,
lots of little moments like that

471
00:45:41,782 --> 00:45:44,567
where the closer and closer
he's getting to this area

472
00:45:44,611 --> 00:45:48,397
that was this site of his grief
and trauma, like,

473
00:45:48,441 --> 00:45:49,790
where he was searching for Rick,

474
00:45:49,834 --> 00:45:51,749
where he had this relationship
with this woman,

475
00:45:51,792 --> 00:45:53,639
there's a lot of things
being stirred up for Daryl,

476
00:45:53,663 --> 00:45:55,883
even when he doesn't realize
that it is.

477
00:45:55,927 --> 00:45:57,145
It's been two years.

478
00:45:57,189 --> 00:45:58,886
How long do you plan
to stay out here?

479
00:45:58,930 --> 00:46:02,934
This episode has a lot more
time jumpage

480
00:46:02,977 --> 00:46:05,110
than we normally have
in an episode,

481
00:46:05,153 --> 00:46:07,112
and that definitely
makes it tricky.

482
00:46:07,155 --> 00:46:11,072
The number-one thing that drives
the time jumps in this episode

483
00:46:11,116 --> 00:46:12,770
is what is the kind of person

484
00:46:12,813 --> 00:46:15,163
that Daryl would have
a relationship with,

485
00:46:15,207 --> 00:46:18,123
and how does that unfold
and how does it happen?

486
00:46:18,166 --> 00:46:20,908
Who the hell are you?

487
00:46:22,649 --> 00:46:24,129
I'm leaving.

488
00:46:26,479 --> 00:46:28,481
We love the idea that this dog

489
00:46:28,524 --> 00:46:31,614
really was the tie
between Daryl and Leah.

490
00:46:31,658 --> 00:46:34,966
We have this instinct
to want to bond with animals,

491
00:46:35,009 --> 00:46:36,619
and, you know,
you kind of think,

492
00:46:36,663 --> 00:46:37,858
"Oh, well,
that person has a dog,

493
00:46:37,882 --> 00:46:39,120
and they don't mistreat the dog.

494
00:46:39,144 --> 00:46:40,469
You know,
maybe they're not so bad."

495
00:46:40,493 --> 00:46:42,190
Thanks for bringing him back.

496
00:46:42,234 --> 00:46:43,452
Come here, boy!

497
00:46:48,066 --> 00:46:49,719
He likes you.

498
00:46:49,763 --> 00:46:51,634
We wanted to see somebody

499
00:46:51,678 --> 00:46:55,029
who is as formidable as Daryl
in her own way.

500
00:46:55,073 --> 00:46:56,814
She's in charge
of her own situation.

501
00:46:56,857 --> 00:46:59,947
She has the same issues
with trust that he does.

502
00:46:59,991 --> 00:47:02,645
I get it, you know?

503
00:47:02,689 --> 00:47:05,648
Being out here by yourself.

504
00:47:05,692 --> 00:47:08,216
You been out here alone
for a long time, too, huh?

505
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:10,001
The other thing
they really have in common

506
00:47:10,044 --> 00:47:12,307
is they're good
at reading other people.

507
00:47:12,351 --> 00:47:14,657
They see something
in each other's eyes

508
00:47:14,701 --> 00:47:19,314
that is a signal that they're
both grief-stricken at this time

509
00:47:19,358 --> 00:47:22,404
and that that person
is not dangerous to them.

510
00:47:22,448 --> 00:47:25,494
So it's better to live
and let live right now.

511
00:47:27,888 --> 00:47:29,368
Who'd you lose?

512
00:47:31,631 --> 00:47:32,850
My brother.

513
00:47:32,893 --> 00:47:35,330
Daryl really feels pulled.

514
00:47:35,374 --> 00:47:37,158
Here's Leah saying,
"Stay with me.

515
00:47:37,202 --> 00:47:39,900
Like, what are you doing
walking up and down that river,

516
00:47:39,944 --> 00:47:41,249
like, over and over again?"

517
00:47:41,293 --> 00:47:43,904
And Carol's coming and saying...

518
00:47:43,948 --> 00:47:45,732
I want you to find some peace.

519
00:47:45,775 --> 00:47:48,343
These two people
that are important in this time

520
00:47:48,387 --> 00:47:50,911
when he could be
completely alone

521
00:47:50,955 --> 00:47:53,696
are both trying to tell him
a version of the same thing,

522
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:57,570
and so he goes back only
to discover it's too late.

523
00:47:57,613 --> 00:47:59,267
Leah!

524
00:47:59,311 --> 00:48:00,941
That's like one
of those things where, again,

525
00:48:00,965 --> 00:48:03,358
Daryl being somebody who carries
the weight of the world

526
00:48:03,402 --> 00:48:04,882
on his shoulders sometimes

527
00:48:04,925 --> 00:48:07,232
cannot help but blame himself
for in some way.

528
00:48:07,275 --> 00:48:10,757
Losing Leah, that's not on you.

529
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,454
Neither is Rick.

530
00:48:12,498 --> 00:48:14,065
Or Connie.

531
00:48:15,109 --> 00:48:17,285
No, that's on you.

532
00:48:17,329 --> 00:48:18,939
From Carol's perspective,

533
00:48:18,983 --> 00:48:21,942
she's like, "Where is this
coming from, dude?"

534
00:48:21,986 --> 00:48:24,205
And I think
from Daryl's perspective,

535
00:48:24,249 --> 00:48:26,599
here's this guy
that's been just burying

536
00:48:26,642 --> 00:48:29,210
all of the pain
that he's been carrying.

537
00:48:29,254 --> 00:48:31,909
I don't need a savior, Daryl,
and I don't need a martyr.

538
00:48:31,952 --> 00:48:33,388
I just need a friend.

539
00:48:33,432 --> 00:48:35,390
Friends don't have
the same damn conversation

540
00:48:35,434 --> 00:48:36,652
over and over again.

541
00:48:36,696 --> 00:48:37,934
Oh, is that
what's happening here?

542
00:48:37,958 --> 00:48:39,394
'Cause this is new to me.

543
00:48:39,438 --> 00:48:41,048
It's what <i>been</i> happening.

544
00:48:41,092 --> 00:48:44,095
There's just this feeling of,
"Were my instincts right,

545
00:48:44,138 --> 00:48:47,054
that this is some sort of, like,
beginning of an end

546
00:48:47,098 --> 00:48:48,229
for us as a group?"

547
00:48:48,273 --> 00:48:51,972
Wanna run? Run.

548
00:48:52,016 --> 00:48:54,235
I know where I'm supposed to be.

549
00:48:54,279 --> 00:48:58,109
I think that Daryl feels
that desire in her

550
00:48:58,152 --> 00:49:00,589
to... to pull away from it.

551
00:49:00,633 --> 00:49:02,635
For him,
being on the mountain...

552
00:49:02,678 --> 00:49:05,072
That's a period of his life
that's over.

553
00:49:05,116 --> 00:49:07,640
He's accepted now
that he needs to be at home.

554
00:49:07,683 --> 00:49:09,598
He has people
that he cares about

555
00:49:09,642 --> 00:49:12,471
and a place that he cares about
continuing to stand.

556
00:49:12,514 --> 00:49:14,125
That's his responsibility now,

557
00:49:14,168 --> 00:49:17,780
and in some ways, he wants her
to make the same choice.

558
00:49:17,824 --> 00:49:20,783
Well, then you should've just
let me get back on the boat.

559
00:49:20,827 --> 00:49:23,134
I should've.

560
00:49:23,177 --> 00:49:25,658
He knows her too well
and can feel

561
00:49:25,701 --> 00:49:28,008
that there's
that little thread of her

562
00:49:28,052 --> 00:49:30,271
that maybe is not
100% committed yet,

563
00:49:30,315 --> 00:49:33,144
and I think that's what
he's calling her out on there.

564
00:49:33,187 --> 00:49:35,798
And I was right.

565
00:49:37,061 --> 00:49:38,323
Our luck's run out, you and me.
