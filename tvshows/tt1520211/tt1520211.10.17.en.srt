1
00:00:00,714 --> 00:00:01,758
No!

2
00:00:01,802 --> 00:00:03,369
Still have breathing in motion.

3
00:00:03,412 --> 00:00:06,067
For a long time, I thought
her way was the only way.

4
00:00:06,111 --> 00:00:09,505
It was survival,
walking with the dead.

5
00:00:09,549 --> 00:00:12,639
But I woke up, and I saw
a different way of life...

6
00:00:12,682 --> 00:00:15,337
One filled with love
and hope, civilization.

7
00:00:15,381 --> 00:00:16,382
Brace!

8
00:00:16,425 --> 00:00:17,252
It's what we thought to protect,

9
00:00:17,296 --> 00:00:18,558
whatever the cost.

10
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:20,299
Rggh, augh!

11
00:00:20,342 --> 00:00:22,127
Right or wrong,
Carol's plan worked.

12
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:24,085
Negan infiltrated
The Whisperers,

13
00:00:24,129 --> 00:00:27,784
gained my mother's trust,
and killed their Alpha.

14
00:00:27,828 --> 00:00:30,048
But a new leader rose,

15
00:00:30,091 --> 00:00:31,131
and the fight continued...

16
00:00:31,788 --> 00:00:33,486
...it took all of us.

17
00:00:33,529 --> 00:00:36,706
Old friends returned
and made us stronger.

18
00:00:38,578 --> 00:00:40,232
Argh!

19
00:00:40,275 --> 00:00:44,018
United, we sacrificed everything
for a brighter tomorrow...

20
00:00:44,062 --> 00:00:45,062
and we won.

21
00:00:47,239 --> 00:00:50,894
Now, we're on the verge
of something else.

22
00:00:50,938 --> 00:00:52,026
Hands in the air, now!

23
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:53,549
A bigger world

24
00:00:53,593 --> 00:00:56,204
filled with endless
possibilities and uncertainty.

25
00:00:56,248 --> 00:00:58,250
This is your last chance!

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,074
OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN
from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn

27
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:22,012
I could have gotten that walker.

28
00:01:22,056 --> 00:01:23,797
You are your mother's daughter.

29
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,972
My dad's, too.

30
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:28,323
What'd you tell RJ?

31
00:01:28,367 --> 00:01:31,239
Well. I took him to the roof.

32
00:01:31,283 --> 00:01:33,111
The sky was full of stars,

33
00:01:33,154 --> 00:01:34,764
and I told him right now,

34
00:01:34,808 --> 00:01:38,116
Mom's looking at
the very same stars as us.

35
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,119
I said the same to Hershel.

36
00:01:41,162 --> 00:01:44,034
Even thought it myself
about all of you.

37
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:46,559
'Cause it's true.

38
00:01:46,602 --> 00:01:48,865
She's out there.

39
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:51,172
Under the same sky.

40
00:01:51,216 --> 00:01:52,782
She is.

41
00:01:54,262 --> 00:01:56,134
This should do it.

42
00:01:56,177 --> 00:01:58,701
Push off. Yeah? On three.

43
00:01:58,745 --> 00:02:01,661
One, two, three.

44
00:02:18,504 --> 00:02:21,115
Hey, Maggie.

45
00:02:27,513 --> 00:02:28,862
I didn't escape,

46
00:02:28,905 --> 00:02:31,430
if that's what you're thinking.

47
00:02:41,309 --> 00:02:43,920
Well, shit.

48
00:03:39,193 --> 00:03:41,151
Hi. Hey.

49
00:03:41,195 --> 00:03:43,632
Gabriel and Rosita just left
with the first group.

50
00:03:43,676 --> 00:03:45,330
Did Oceanside give an answer?

51
00:03:45,373 --> 00:03:46,853
Yes, and they'll take some.

52
00:03:46,896 --> 00:03:49,247
Luke's gathering up about
a dozen of them.

53
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:50,813
We can take the rest.

54
00:03:50,857 --> 00:03:52,859
Hi.

55
00:03:52,902 --> 00:03:54,600
Maggie.

56
00:03:56,645 --> 00:03:58,908
Who's that?

57
00:03:58,952 --> 00:04:02,390
These are my people.

58
00:04:02,434 --> 00:04:04,218
Is everybody okay?

59
00:04:04,262 --> 00:04:06,438
Hershel's fine.

60
00:04:06,481 --> 00:04:07,743
Don't worry.

61
00:04:07,787 --> 00:04:09,223
Everyone else?

62
00:04:09,267 --> 00:04:10,616
Holding tight at the rendezvous.

63
00:04:10,659 --> 00:04:12,008
Let's bring them back.

64
00:04:12,052 --> 00:04:13,572
Come on.
I want you to meet my friends.

65
00:04:15,229 --> 00:04:20,190
Carol, Daryl... Elijah and Cole.

66
00:04:20,234 --> 00:04:22,497
Hershel and I were living
with their people

67
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:24,630
until recently.

68
00:04:24,673 --> 00:04:26,066
We lost the village.

69
00:04:26,109 --> 00:04:28,677
And nowwe need to live with you.

70
00:04:28,721 --> 00:04:31,289
I thought
I'd take them to Hilltop.

71
00:04:34,814 --> 00:04:37,382
What is it?

72
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:05,366
Maggie.

73
00:05:06,933 --> 00:05:10,153
Negan was with the Whisperers.

74
00:05:10,197 --> 00:05:12,286
That night.

75
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:14,636
I wanted you to hear it
from me, because...

76
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,291
It was you?

77
00:05:20,381 --> 00:05:21,948
You let him out?

78
00:05:21,991 --> 00:05:25,734
Alpha needed to die,

79
00:05:25,778 --> 00:05:29,172
and Negan was our best chance.

80
00:05:31,784 --> 00:05:34,177
We were gonna lose everything.

81
00:05:35,701 --> 00:05:38,312
Negan's a reason we didn't.

82
00:05:42,621 --> 00:05:45,058
So, what now?

83
00:05:45,101 --> 00:05:46,407
What?

84
00:05:46,451 --> 00:05:50,411
Everyone's just supposed to
go to... what was it?

85
00:05:50,455 --> 00:05:52,065
Alexandria. Right.

86
00:05:52,108 --> 00:05:53,936
So, we all go to Alexandria

87
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:56,591
and live next door to the guy
who torched this place?

88
00:05:56,635 --> 00:05:58,854
Same guy
who killed her husband...

89
00:05:58,898 --> 00:06:00,247
Is that right?

90
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:03,337
We're still figurin' things out.

91
00:06:06,471 --> 00:06:08,995
Thanks for telling me.

92
00:06:10,213 --> 00:06:13,565
We need to get to Hershel
and the others.

93
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,829
You didn't have to do that.

94
00:06:16,872 --> 00:06:20,223
I did. I owe her that much.

95
00:06:22,008 --> 00:06:25,490
I'll go with her,
try to smooth things over.

96
00:06:25,533 --> 00:06:29,450
She's never gonna come around
on him, you know.

97
00:06:29,494 --> 00:06:30,886
Have you?

98
00:06:36,631 --> 00:06:39,068
It's good to see her, though.

99
00:06:40,156 --> 00:06:42,028
Yeah.

100
00:06:53,561 --> 00:06:55,694
Daryl!

101
00:06:55,737 --> 00:06:57,870
Hold on!

102
00:06:58,914 --> 00:07:01,134
You're gonna pick up
Maggie's people, right?

103
00:07:01,177 --> 00:07:02,788
Yeah.

104
00:07:02,831 --> 00:07:05,051
I wanna come with you.

105
00:07:05,094 --> 00:07:09,011
You're gonna cover some
new ground where we could...

106
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:12,928
you know, keep an eye out,
for Connie.

107
00:07:14,582 --> 00:07:17,193
Come on.

108
00:08:16,818 --> 00:08:18,690
Hey.

109
00:08:18,733 --> 00:08:21,867
The town marked the shelter
at about 10 miles east.

110
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:23,129
Too far out of the way.

111
00:08:23,172 --> 00:08:25,740
We might not hit anything else
before dark.

112
00:08:25,784 --> 00:08:27,916
Let's keep going.

113
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,882
About a half hour left, boss.

114
00:08:36,925 --> 00:08:38,274
If we're lucky.

115
00:08:38,318 --> 00:08:39,841
We can go a little longer.

116
00:08:39,885 --> 00:08:41,756
No, we can't.

117
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,671
It's getting dark.

118
00:08:43,715 --> 00:08:46,195
We shouldn't be out here.

119
00:08:58,512 --> 00:09:00,383
Okay.

120
00:09:00,427 --> 00:09:02,603
Okay?

121
00:09:02,647 --> 00:09:04,562
Okay what?

122
00:09:04,605 --> 00:09:06,738
You mean stay here?

123
00:09:06,781 --> 00:09:08,043
We should go up in the woods,

124
00:09:08,087 --> 00:09:10,219
find higher ground.

125
00:09:13,179 --> 00:09:14,876
I think we'll all sleep better

126
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,486
in some shelter.

127
00:09:17,705 --> 00:09:21,143
Alright.

128
00:09:21,187 --> 00:09:23,581
Okay. So, all we have to do

129
00:09:23,624 --> 00:09:25,757
is clear this whole parking lot
full of sickos

130
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,672
and hole up for the night?

131
00:09:27,715 --> 00:09:30,805
No sweat.

132
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:24,076
Aah!

133
00:10:24,119 --> 00:10:25,686
Maggie, you okay?

134
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:29,864
Just a cut,
but I could use a little help!

135
00:11:15,127 --> 00:11:17,999
Alright, so,
maybe a little sweat.

136
00:11:39,325 --> 00:11:41,196
It's all clear.

137
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,676
Cole's on watch.

138
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,200
Okay. Good.

139
00:11:48,813 --> 00:11:51,467
Hey, I'm glad you're here.

140
00:11:51,511 --> 00:11:53,469
When your letters stopped,
I thought,

141
00:11:53,513 --> 00:11:55,820
I don't know,
maybe you were gone.

142
00:11:58,823 --> 00:12:02,217
I wasn't close to the drop
for a long time.

143
00:12:02,261 --> 00:12:04,306
But when I was...

144
00:12:05,743 --> 00:12:08,833
Well, when I was,
I just didn't stop.

145
00:12:18,973 --> 00:12:22,803
What happened out there?

146
00:12:22,847 --> 00:12:24,326
Well...

147
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:28,156
you know, Georgie had
all these good ideas.

148
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:32,160
With things going so well
at Hilltop,

149
00:12:32,204 --> 00:12:34,772
the idea of doing that
for others felt good.

150
00:12:36,556 --> 00:12:41,169
So, we'd find groups
and do what we could.

151
00:12:41,213 --> 00:12:43,563
But it'd always go sideways.

152
00:12:43,606 --> 00:12:46,131
She still out there? Georgie?

153
00:12:46,174 --> 00:12:47,523
I don't know.

154
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:50,135
We were in this little place
near Knoxville

155
00:12:50,178 --> 00:12:52,398
a couple summers ago.

156
00:12:52,441 --> 00:12:54,530
I had this group.

157
00:12:54,574 --> 00:13:00,014
We taught them
to reroute water, build a forge.

158
00:13:00,058 --> 00:13:02,712
She heard about this city
out west,

159
00:13:02,756 --> 00:13:04,690
so she and the twins went
out there to check it out,

160
00:13:04,714 --> 00:13:07,674
and I stayed back with Hershel.

161
00:13:07,717 --> 00:13:11,634
And not long after,
the place fell and we ran,

162
00:13:11,678 --> 00:13:14,986
and I haven't seen her since.

163
00:13:15,029 --> 00:13:17,684
What happened to your group?

164
00:13:17,727 --> 00:13:19,338
Their village?

165
00:13:25,866 --> 00:13:27,650
Not now.

166
00:13:27,694 --> 00:13:29,391
Alright.

167
00:13:29,435 --> 00:13:33,787
It's actually good
to say some of it out loud.

168
00:13:35,745 --> 00:13:38,357
I just can't say all of it,
you know?

169
00:13:39,271 --> 00:13:41,795
I know.

170
00:13:44,102 --> 00:13:46,495
I almost came home
after Knoxville.

171
00:13:46,539 --> 00:13:48,802
Maybe I should've.

172
00:13:50,195 --> 00:13:52,762
Maybe I should've.

173
00:13:54,025 --> 00:13:56,375
Why didn't you?

174
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:58,943
We, uh...

175
00:14:01,206 --> 00:14:03,817
...took a detour.

176
00:14:05,471 --> 00:14:08,953
My nana had this place
by the ocean.

177
00:14:10,911 --> 00:14:12,608
After Bethie died,

178
00:14:12,652 --> 00:14:16,351
Glenn and I talked about
going there.

179
00:14:16,395 --> 00:14:19,964
Not forever,
just for a little while.

180
00:14:20,007 --> 00:14:22,270
We never did.

181
00:14:31,323 --> 00:14:35,718
But I thought Hershel could.

182
00:14:35,762 --> 00:14:37,938
He loved it.

183
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:42,464
Waves twice his size
knocking him to the ground.

184
00:14:42,508 --> 00:14:44,989
He just bounced right back up,
laughing.

185
00:14:49,558 --> 00:14:51,473
We watched the sunrise,

186
00:14:51,517 --> 00:14:54,999
watched the water
crashing against the rocks.

187
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:03,268
It was so peaceful.

188
00:15:03,311 --> 00:15:05,748
Hardly any walkers.

189
00:15:08,012 --> 00:15:10,971
And then one night,
we stayed up really late

190
00:15:11,015 --> 00:15:14,932
and told him stories
about his family.

191
00:15:14,975 --> 00:15:18,239
Beth and Shawn and...

192
00:15:18,283 --> 00:15:20,763
his granddaddy.

193
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:26,987
He asked how his daddy died.

194
00:15:28,423 --> 00:15:30,164
I knew he would.

195
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:32,384
I knew it was coming.

196
00:15:38,564 --> 00:15:41,393
I told him
that a bad man killed him.

197
00:15:43,482 --> 00:15:45,353
He wanted to know

198
00:15:45,397 --> 00:15:48,704
if that man
got what he deserved.

199
00:15:48,748 --> 00:15:51,881
He wanted to know
if that man was dead.

200
00:16:00,238 --> 00:16:01,543
Truth is, I left home

201
00:16:01,587 --> 00:16:03,371
because I couldn't have Negan

202
00:16:03,415 --> 00:16:06,635
taking up any more space
in my head...

203
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:09,725
and then I realized

204
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:13,033
I didn't want to bring Hershel
back to that.

205
00:16:15,601 --> 00:16:19,387
Then the next morning, we met...

206
00:16:19,431 --> 00:16:23,391
this whole community of people

207
00:16:23,435 --> 00:16:26,916
who needed us
as much as we needed them.

208
00:16:30,442 --> 00:16:32,966
And it felt like
it was meant to be.

209
00:16:37,405 --> 00:16:40,408
But that's over, too.

210
00:16:40,452 --> 00:16:42,976
You could come on home.

211
00:16:45,892 --> 00:16:47,981
It's not decided with Negan.

212
00:16:48,025 --> 00:16:50,418
Not yet.

213
00:16:50,462 --> 00:16:52,464
And what Carol did, she...

214
00:16:52,507 --> 00:16:54,988
What she felt she had to.

215
00:16:55,032 --> 00:16:57,077
Mm.

216
00:16:58,644 --> 00:17:01,473
God knows what I would have done
if I was there.

217
00:17:11,657 --> 00:17:15,052
I'm next door if you need me,
alright?

218
00:17:47,214 --> 00:17:48,607
Time to go.

219
00:17:51,131 --> 00:17:52,698
Damn.

220
00:17:52,741 --> 00:17:55,179
I actually got some shut eye
in that rust coffin.

221
00:17:59,879 --> 00:18:03,143
Hey, isn't your friend
supposed to be on watch?

222
00:19:08,817 --> 00:19:11,516
You left your post.

223
00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:14,214
Sorry, I just...

224
00:19:14,258 --> 00:19:17,130
You can't go running off
by yourself like that.

225
00:19:22,701 --> 00:19:25,443
Her sister's missing.

226
00:19:40,588 --> 00:19:43,200
He just lost his, too.

227
00:20:06,571 --> 00:20:08,747
We have to go.

228
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:11,489
I just had to check.

229
00:20:26,678 --> 00:20:30,072
Kelly's sister...
She still out there?

230
00:20:30,116 --> 00:20:31,639
I don't know.

231
00:20:31,683 --> 00:20:33,206
I hope so.

232
00:20:34,468 --> 00:20:38,080
Thing is, I went looking for her
so many times.

233
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:42,476
But people are just gone,
you know?

234
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,825
Even if you find 'em,

235
00:20:43,869 --> 00:20:45,740
doesn't mean you get 'em back.

236
00:20:45,784 --> 00:20:47,568
Maybe it's best
if she don't know.

237
00:20:47,612 --> 00:20:48,874
No, she should.

238
00:20:48,917 --> 00:20:50,267
My dad used to say,

239
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:52,834
"A wound can't heal
'til it hits air."

240
00:20:53,879 --> 00:20:55,576
You know that ain't true, right?

241
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,186
Medicine wise.

242
00:20:57,230 --> 00:21:00,059
He always made it
sound like it was.

243
00:21:01,147 --> 00:21:02,627
Yeah.

244
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:04,585
We're almost there.

245
00:21:04,629 --> 00:21:07,196
Can't wait for you
to meet Hershel.

246
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,024
Hey.

247
00:21:12,289 --> 00:21:14,421
No.

248
00:21:28,783 --> 00:21:30,394
Shit.

249
00:21:30,437 --> 00:21:32,265
It's them.

250
00:21:32,309 --> 00:21:34,398
They found us.

251
00:21:51,371 --> 00:21:54,983
Hershel?

252
00:21:55,027 --> 00:21:56,724
No!

253
00:22:07,256 --> 00:22:08,823
They must've followed us,
Maggie.

254
00:22:08,867 --> 00:22:10,042
We were so damn careful.

255
00:22:10,085 --> 00:22:12,305
I don't know how, but...

256
00:22:12,349 --> 00:22:13,698
it's them.

257
00:22:13,741 --> 00:22:17,354
They're out here. We don't know that.

258
00:22:17,397 --> 00:22:19,921
Two of our people are dead,
Maggie.

259
00:22:19,965 --> 00:22:21,793
Where the hell's everyone else?

260
00:22:21,836 --> 00:22:23,751
Fire's out.

261
00:22:23,795 --> 00:22:26,319
Why haven't they come back?

262
00:22:26,363 --> 00:22:29,235
It's the Reapers.

263
00:22:29,278 --> 00:22:30,671
What's a Reaper?

264
00:22:30,715 --> 00:22:32,194
The people
who attacked our home.

265
00:22:32,238 --> 00:22:33,674
Came outta nowhere.

266
00:22:33,718 --> 00:22:35,154
Wiped out anything in their way.

267
00:22:35,197 --> 00:22:36,460
They're here... Enough.

268
00:22:38,113 --> 00:22:40,899
We need
to get our heads on straight.

269
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:42,335
Find our people.

270
00:22:42,379 --> 00:22:45,120
Find my son.

271
00:23:04,618 --> 00:23:06,054
They're scattered.

272
00:23:06,098 --> 00:23:07,752
Definitely running.

273
00:23:07,795 --> 00:23:10,624
All headed north.

274
00:23:10,668 --> 00:23:14,454
These... These people...

275
00:23:14,498 --> 00:23:15,934
if it's them...

276
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:17,370
We'll find them.

277
00:23:17,414 --> 00:23:19,720
All of them.

278
00:23:22,288 --> 00:23:24,769
Any more kids in your group?

279
00:23:24,812 --> 00:23:28,120
That's him.

280
00:23:28,163 --> 00:23:31,819
Come on.

281
00:23:31,863 --> 00:23:34,169
Stay quiet and alert.

282
00:23:34,213 --> 00:23:35,930
If anything's out there
that isn't our people,

283
00:23:35,954 --> 00:23:38,347
we kill it.

284
00:24:27,875 --> 00:24:30,487
Trail splits.

285
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:32,532
Hershel?

286
00:24:32,576 --> 00:24:34,316
I lost him.

287
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,971
Someone could have
picked him up, though.

288
00:24:37,494 --> 00:24:39,191
What now?

289
00:24:39,234 --> 00:24:40,932
We split up the group.

290
00:24:40,975 --> 00:24:43,064
No way.

291
00:24:43,108 --> 00:24:44,631
My people are out there.

292
00:24:44,675 --> 00:24:46,391
Splitting up is
the fastest way to find them.

293
00:24:46,415 --> 00:24:48,592
And what if something finds us?

294
00:24:51,029 --> 00:24:52,465
Stay alive.

295
00:24:54,554 --> 00:24:56,948
Daryl and I cross.
Keep heading north.

296
00:24:56,991 --> 00:24:59,428
We'll catch up with you.

297
00:26:10,195 --> 00:26:11,762
Something's out there.

298
00:26:13,024 --> 00:26:14,678
We gotta move.

299
00:26:21,685 --> 00:26:23,121
Hey.

300
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:26,820
You okay?

301
00:26:26,864 --> 00:26:28,517
Can you, uh...

302
00:26:41,618 --> 00:26:43,097
Yeah.

303
00:26:43,141 --> 00:26:44,969
This is a lot.

304
00:26:45,012 --> 00:26:47,580
But you're not alone.

305
00:26:47,624 --> 00:26:48,973
You and me.

306
00:26:49,016 --> 00:26:50,844
Okay?

307
00:26:53,717 --> 00:26:55,588
Maggie's counting on us.

308
00:27:02,029 --> 00:27:03,683
Come on.

309
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:52,036
Don't move.

310
00:27:53,385 --> 00:27:55,082
Daryl. Daryl.

311
00:27:55,126 --> 00:27:56,431
Everyone stand down.

312
00:27:56,475 --> 00:27:58,390
Daryl, she's one of ours.

313
00:27:58,433 --> 00:28:00,000
Come on. Let's go.

314
00:28:00,044 --> 00:28:01,959
Thank God.

315
00:28:02,002 --> 00:28:04,657
Sorry.

316
00:28:11,142 --> 00:28:12,621
What happened?

317
00:28:12,665 --> 00:28:14,449
Everything was fine,

318
00:28:14,493 --> 00:28:16,930
and then the whole place
was suddenly on fire.

319
00:28:16,974 --> 00:28:18,627
You see who did it? No.

320
00:28:18,671 --> 00:28:19,977
We just ran.

321
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:23,154
Jen and Billy...
They didn't make it out.

322
00:28:23,197 --> 00:28:26,461
And something in the woods
took out Matty,

323
00:28:26,505 --> 00:28:29,203
but we didn't get a clear look.

324
00:28:29,247 --> 00:28:30,944
We know who did it.

325
00:28:30,988 --> 00:28:32,467
Goddamn Reapers.

326
00:28:32,511 --> 00:28:35,427
They're in these woods
hunting us one by one.

327
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:37,342
Where's Hershel? Kim had him.

328
00:28:37,385 --> 00:28:39,300
He's out here, somewhere.

329
00:28:39,344 --> 00:28:40,649
It's been hours.

330
00:28:40,693 --> 00:28:42,826
You're the first people
we've seen.

331
00:30:02,296 --> 00:30:04,385
It's a trap.

332
00:30:04,429 --> 00:30:06,039
They're trying to flush us out,

333
00:30:06,083 --> 00:30:07,171
pick us off one by one.

334
00:30:07,214 --> 00:30:08,215
Yeah.

335
00:30:17,268 --> 00:30:18,312
Oh, shit.

336
00:30:18,356 --> 00:30:20,140
Maya, get down!

337
00:30:53,521 --> 00:30:54,827
I think she saw Hershel.

338
00:30:54,871 --> 00:30:56,698
That's what
she's trying to tell me.

339
00:30:56,742 --> 00:30:58,613
We got to get to 'em first.

340
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:09,015
We should...

341
00:31:11,061 --> 00:31:13,280
There's only one shooter.

342
00:31:13,324 --> 00:31:15,152
Three shots. One at a time.
He had to reload.

343
00:31:15,195 --> 00:31:16,893
Yeah.

344
00:31:16,936 --> 00:31:19,417
I'll go around
and flank him.
No.

345
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,853
Just keep his attention here.

346
00:33:47,521 --> 00:33:49,175
Come on.

347
00:33:56,617 --> 00:33:57,923
Daryl, wait.

348
00:34:04,930 --> 00:34:07,150
Who are you?

349
00:34:07,193 --> 00:34:10,457
Who are you?!

350
00:34:10,501 --> 00:34:12,720
You're one of them, right?

351
00:34:12,764 --> 00:34:14,635
You attacked our home.

352
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:19,162
Killed my friends, our family.

353
00:34:19,205 --> 00:34:21,860
Why'd you do this?

354
00:34:21,903 --> 00:34:25,124
We did nothing to you.

355
00:34:25,168 --> 00:34:27,039
Who are you?

356
00:34:27,083 --> 00:34:28,345
Who are you?!

357
00:34:28,388 --> 00:34:32,392
What do you call yourselves?!

358
00:34:32,436 --> 00:34:34,655
I know it's just you out here,

359
00:34:34,699 --> 00:34:36,222
so you can
answer my questions or die.

360
00:34:36,266 --> 00:34:37,832
It's your choice.

361
00:34:44,361 --> 00:34:46,189
Why'd you do it?

362
00:34:50,541 --> 00:34:53,152
Pope marked you.

363
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:03,075
Get down!

364
00:35:42,419 --> 00:35:44,464
Hey, Mom.

365
00:36:51,444 --> 00:36:53,881
I know you helped Elijah.

366
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:56,362
Thank you.

367
00:36:56,406 --> 00:36:59,278
He's been through a lot.

368
00:36:59,322 --> 00:37:00,540
It's okay.

369
00:37:00,584 --> 00:37:04,022
We all have.

370
00:37:06,111 --> 00:37:08,722
Who's older?

371
00:37:08,766 --> 00:37:11,247
You or your sister?

372
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:14,075
Connie is.

373
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:18,776
I came as a...

374
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:22,345
surprise for our parents.

375
00:37:23,955 --> 00:37:26,349
By that point,
they were too tired.

376
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:32,224
Connie always kept an eye on me.

377
00:37:35,532 --> 00:37:37,925
Even once she had
her own life...

378
00:37:41,494 --> 00:37:44,367
...she shared it with me.

379
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:48,240
Tried to take care of me.

380
00:37:51,896 --> 00:37:53,941
You had a sister, too, right?

381
00:37:53,985 --> 00:37:56,379
You're the oldest?

382
00:37:57,815 --> 00:37:59,947
How'd you know?

383
00:38:01,688 --> 00:38:04,735
I can just tell sometimes.

384
00:38:04,778 --> 00:38:07,520
You seem like
you've been in charge of people

385
00:38:07,564 --> 00:38:08,826
your whole life.

386
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:11,263
You protect them.

387
00:38:14,484 --> 00:38:16,964
Just like my sister.

388
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:24,972
I hope
I get to meet her someday.

389
00:38:30,804 --> 00:38:33,329
You will.

390
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,768
You alright?

391
00:38:41,337 --> 00:38:43,948
Yeah.

392
00:38:51,782 --> 00:38:54,088
It's real quiet out there.

393
00:38:54,132 --> 00:38:56,961
For now.

394
00:38:57,004 --> 00:38:59,790
Hey, that guy
knew he was a dead man.

395
00:38:59,833 --> 00:39:01,705
He was just messing with you.

396
00:39:01,748 --> 00:39:03,010
Maybe.

397
00:39:03,054 --> 00:39:04,708
We'll stay here a few more days.

398
00:39:04,751 --> 00:39:07,798
Sweep the grounds,
make sure he was alone.

399
00:39:07,841 --> 00:39:10,061
Nothing follows us
back to Alexandria.

400
00:39:10,104 --> 00:39:11,584
We'll take the long way back.

401
00:39:11,628 --> 00:39:13,151
Cover our tracks.

402
00:39:15,022 --> 00:39:16,763
Does this mean
you're coming home?

403
00:39:16,807 --> 00:39:18,678
These people deserve one.

404
00:39:18,722 --> 00:39:21,028
So does Hershel.

405
00:39:21,072 --> 00:39:24,162
I'll deal with Negan
if I have to.

406
00:39:24,205 --> 00:39:28,558
Right now, the only thing
that matters is Alexandria.

407
00:39:28,601 --> 00:39:32,170

446
00:41:53,616 --> 00:41:56,444
Yeah.

447
00:41:56,488 --> 00:41:58,403
It is.

448
00:41:58,446 --> 00:42:00,840
So, this episode is called
"Home Sweet Home"

449
00:42:00,884 --> 00:42:02,581
because, in a lot of ways,

450
00:42:02,625 --> 00:42:06,150
this episode is about our people
wanting to go home

451
00:42:06,193 --> 00:42:08,108
after the war
with the Whisperers,

452
00:42:08,152 --> 00:42:09,936
and Maggie coming home,

453
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:12,548
only to find
that home has been destroyed

454
00:42:12,591 --> 00:42:14,158
and what happens next.

455
00:42:14,201 --> 00:42:16,290
"Home" has taken on
such a complex meaning,

456
00:42:16,334 --> 00:42:18,510
especially since Maggie
now has to live

457
00:42:18,554 --> 00:42:21,382
possibly next door to Negan,
her mortal enemy.

458
00:42:21,426 --> 00:42:24,124
So there's a lot of
emotional territory

459
00:42:24,168 --> 00:42:26,083
that's being explored
in this episode.

460
00:42:29,652 --> 00:42:31,131
Hey, Maggie.

461
00:42:31,175 --> 00:42:32,848
At the start of this episode,
Maggie and Negan

462
00:42:32,872 --> 00:42:36,049
set eyes on each other for
the first time in many years.

463
00:42:36,093 --> 00:42:38,312
This is a charged moment
for both of them.

464
00:42:38,356 --> 00:42:41,272
And from Maggie's side,
what we wanted to play

465
00:42:41,315 --> 00:42:43,666
was that in some ways, you know,

466
00:42:43,709 --> 00:42:45,581
she's really surprised by this,

467
00:42:45,624 --> 00:42:48,584
but she's trying not to let him
rattle her too much.

468
00:42:48,627 --> 00:42:52,239
The interesting thing is,
we had dialogue for her,

469
00:42:52,283 --> 00:42:54,938
and in the editing process,
we wound up stripping it out,

470
00:42:54,981 --> 00:42:57,331
because her reactions
were so strong

471
00:42:57,375 --> 00:43:00,552
in these awkward silences,
there's a lot going on

472
00:43:00,596 --> 00:43:02,293
in that moment
between the two of them.

473
00:43:02,336 --> 00:43:04,991
Negan was with the Whisperers

474
00:43:05,035 --> 00:43:06,993
that night.

475
00:43:07,037 --> 00:43:08,647
I wanted you to hear it from me

476
00:43:08,691 --> 00:43:10,170
because... It was you?

477
00:43:10,214 --> 00:43:12,129
You let him out?

478
00:43:12,172 --> 00:43:14,348
The scene between Maggie and
Carol at the Hilltop

479
00:43:14,392 --> 00:43:16,176
is one that I really love.

480
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:18,222
I think both of these actors
are so strong.

481
00:43:18,265 --> 00:43:20,441
Alpha needed to die.

482
00:43:20,485 --> 00:43:23,227
And Negan was our best chance.

483
00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:26,230
We wanted to show, like, a scene
of how friendship means

484
00:43:26,273 --> 00:43:27,555
that sometimes
you have to tell people

485
00:43:27,579 --> 00:43:29,189
things that they
don't want to hear

486
00:43:29,233 --> 00:43:30,713
and that you don't want to say.

487
00:43:30,756 --> 00:43:33,977
This is clearly a painful
revelation for Maggie,

488
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:35,326
but the two of them are able

489
00:43:35,369 --> 00:43:37,458
to have a civil conversation
about it,

490
00:43:37,502 --> 00:43:38,871
kind of work through
their emotions,

491
00:43:38,895 --> 00:43:40,766
and then keep moving on.

492
00:43:40,810 --> 00:43:42,681
Thanks for telling me.

493
00:43:42,725 --> 00:43:46,380
We need to get to Hershel
and the others.

494
00:43:46,424 --> 00:43:50,254
We knew that
for Maggie's big episode back,

495
00:43:50,297 --> 00:43:53,213
we obviously saw her
in episode 16.

496
00:43:53,257 --> 00:43:55,912
However, we didn't really
get to know

497
00:43:55,955 --> 00:43:58,175
much about
what she's been up to,

498
00:43:58,218 --> 00:44:00,960
who is this masked man
that she showed up with.

499
00:44:01,004 --> 00:44:02,875
That friendship
between Maggie and Daryl

500
00:44:02,919 --> 00:44:04,355
is also a really deep one,

501
00:44:04,398 --> 00:44:07,053
and one that has lasted
many years.

502
00:44:07,097 --> 00:44:09,447
Maggie can be kind of
vulnerable with him

503
00:44:09,490 --> 00:44:13,364
in a way that she maybe is not
ready to be with everybody yet.

504
00:44:13,407 --> 00:44:16,672
It's actually good
to say some of it out loud.

505
00:44:19,152 --> 00:44:21,633
I just can't say all of it,
you know?

506
00:44:22,634 --> 00:44:23,809
I know.

507
00:44:23,853 --> 00:44:25,681
I really wanted people to feel

508
00:44:25,724 --> 00:44:28,422
just that friendship
between them again.

509
00:44:28,466 --> 00:44:31,382
I find the way that they
react to each other so moving.

510
00:44:31,425 --> 00:44:33,732
Daryl says very little
in the scene,

511
00:44:33,776 --> 00:44:35,255
in the way of dialogue.

512
00:44:35,299 --> 00:44:38,302
But there is so much going on,
on his face.

513
00:44:38,345 --> 00:44:41,348
I'll be next door
if you need me, alright?

514
00:44:41,392 --> 00:44:44,830
He's just there for her,
in a really gentle way,

515
00:44:44,874 --> 00:44:47,833
not pushing her too hard,
because she's not ready.

516
00:44:47,877 --> 00:44:50,096
But just being a rock

517
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:51,924
in the way that Daryl
knows how to be.

518
00:44:58,496 --> 00:45:01,760
I think, in the time of COVID
and all the restrictions,

519
00:45:01,804 --> 00:45:05,111
the amount of action
that we can do in an episode

520
00:45:05,155 --> 00:45:06,896
is a little different
than usual.

521
00:45:06,939 --> 00:45:08,680
What we went for,
which is just...

522
00:45:08,724 --> 00:45:13,206
It's more of this kind of
creepy, tense sneaking action.

523
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:15,731
Anything that's
just a couple of people

524
00:45:15,774 --> 00:45:17,515
is easier at this point

525
00:45:17,558 --> 00:45:19,647
than anything that involves
multiple people.

526
00:45:19,691 --> 00:45:22,650
And anything you have action,
there are so many people

527
00:45:22,694 --> 00:45:25,958
that are involved in making it
come to life on set.

528
00:45:26,002 --> 00:45:28,221
3... 2... 1... go!

529
00:45:28,265 --> 00:45:30,658
Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah!

530
00:45:30,702 --> 00:45:32,704
So, you've got, you know,
stunts coordinators.

531
00:45:32,748 --> 00:45:34,793
You also have people
on the effects side,

532
00:45:34,837 --> 00:45:36,621
looking at
what needs to be enhanced.

533
00:45:36,664 --> 00:45:38,318
There's a lot of
safety protocols

534
00:45:38,362 --> 00:45:40,277
that come with that
on top of the COVID stuff.

535
00:45:41,844 --> 00:45:44,368
I think that people
really have a spirit

536
00:45:44,411 --> 00:45:47,893
of wanting to make everything
exciting and great anyway.

537
00:45:47,937 --> 00:45:49,677
So these kinds of sequences

538
00:45:49,721 --> 00:45:52,680
are ones that everybody
really comes together on

539
00:45:52,724 --> 00:45:54,595
and works really hard on
together.

540
00:46:00,166 --> 00:46:01,515
Hey, Mom.

541
00:46:01,559 --> 00:46:03,343
After all the tension
in the woods,

542
00:46:03,387 --> 00:46:05,606
we definitely wanted
to reveal Hershel

543
00:46:05,650 --> 00:46:07,347
to be sweet and a little funny.

544
00:46:07,391 --> 00:46:10,829
We want to show
that the young Hershel

545
00:46:10,873 --> 00:46:14,224
is a little bit like his mom
and a little bit like his dad.

546
00:46:14,267 --> 00:46:16,008
I'm a "glass half full"
kind of guy.

547
00:46:16,052 --> 00:46:19,055
And I think that there were ways
that Glenn could find

548
00:46:19,098 --> 00:46:21,579
the brighter sides of life
sometimes

549
00:46:21,622 --> 00:46:24,277
that I think were really
important for the survivors.

550
00:46:24,321 --> 00:46:26,149
It wouldn't hurt you
to think things through

551
00:46:26,192 --> 00:46:27,977
a little more carefully
next time, would it?

552
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:29,413
Sorry.

553
00:46:29,456 --> 00:46:31,719
Got a cool car.

554
00:46:31,763 --> 00:46:33,219
And so we thought
it was really fun

555
00:46:33,243 --> 00:46:35,375
to kind of introduce him
in a situation

556
00:46:35,419 --> 00:46:37,682
where, like, "Oh, like,
this kid has survival skills."

557
00:46:37,725 --> 00:46:40,380
He clearly, like,
somehow got up a tree,

558
00:46:40,424 --> 00:46:42,165
managed to stay away
from the bad guys,

559
00:46:42,208 --> 00:46:43,862
and yet he's a rascal.

560
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:51,391
When Maggie strolls on home,
I think, for Negan,

561
00:46:51,435 --> 00:46:53,326
there's a lot of things
running through his head.

562
00:46:53,350 --> 00:46:56,222
He has gone through
this whole journey over years.

563
00:46:56,266 --> 00:46:59,573
He's tried to convince them,
"I've paid my debt to society."

564
00:46:59,617 --> 00:47:02,838
And he realizes that
when Maggie is now here,

565
00:47:02,881 --> 00:47:05,536
that completely
changes the calculus,

566
00:47:05,579 --> 00:47:07,930
because, of course,
people love Maggie

567
00:47:07,973 --> 00:47:09,322
a lot more than they love him.

568
00:47:09,366 --> 00:47:12,630
And if Maggie's not happy
that he's there,

569
00:47:12,673 --> 00:47:14,545
what's that gonna mean
for Negan's future.

570
00:47:14,588 --> 00:47:17,069
So I think, in Negan's mind,
he's just trying to figure out,

571
00:47:17,113 --> 00:47:18,766
like, "Was that all for nothing?

572
00:47:18,810 --> 00:47:21,030
What comes next?
What do I have to do?

573
00:47:21,073 --> 00:47:23,510
How do I deal with her,
knowing that she hates me?"

574
00:47:23,554 --> 00:47:25,164
So I think that's a big part

575
00:47:25,208 --> 00:47:27,210
of kind of
the emotional underpinnings

576
00:47:27,253 --> 00:47:28,907
of the story, going forward.
