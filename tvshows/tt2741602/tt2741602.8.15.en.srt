1
00:00:02,643 --> 00:00:05,501
Please hurry, Ms. Keen. He
doesn't like to be kept waiting.

2
00:00:05,526 --> 00:00:07,134
Is this how it works around here?

3
00:00:07,159 --> 00:00:08,725
He snaps his fingers

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,014
and everyone just trembles?

5
00:00:11,049 --> 00:00:12,679
If they have any sense.

6
00:00:13,393 --> 00:00:15,432
Aren't you coming?
- Mm.

7
00:00:22,743 --> 00:00:25,003
Ah. Thank God you're here.

8
00:00:25,038 --> 00:00:28,173
The boys and I were chatting
about failed expectations.

9
00:00:28,208 --> 00:00:30,475
I'll catch you up. First I said...

10
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:32,811
"Kansas was an awful bloodbath,

11
00:00:32,846 --> 00:00:34,312
and, sure, that was fun,

12
00:00:34,348 --> 00:00:36,081
but you let Reddington get away."

13
00:00:36,116 --> 00:00:38,416
Then they said, "So sorry.

14
00:00:38,452 --> 00:00:40,252
We promise to do better next time.

15
00:00:40,287 --> 00:00:42,821
Please, Neville, what about
my wife and kids?"

16
00:00:42,856 --> 00:00:45,357
To which I said, "Wife and kids?

17
00:00:45,392 --> 00:00:48,627
What about my wife? What about my kids?"

18
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:51,529
You're insane!

19
00:00:54,001 --> 00:00:57,502
Why? Because I stabbed a man
who was suffocating?

20
00:00:57,537 --> 00:00:59,537
I suppose that was rather crazy of me.

21
00:00:59,573 --> 00:01:02,073
Almost as crazy as partnering
with an FBI agent.

22
00:01:02,109 --> 00:01:03,708
No... No!

23
00:01:06,113 --> 00:01:08,213
You find him at his girlfriend's.

24
00:01:08,248 --> 00:01:11,850
You have him at gunpoint,
but somehow he gets away.

25
00:01:11,885 --> 00:01:13,685
Why is that? Why don't I have

26
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,321
everything you promised me, Agent Keen?

27
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:21,359
I have a lead.

28
00:01:21,395 --> 00:01:22,788
On Reddington.

29
00:01:22,812 --> 00:01:24,129
I can prove he's N-13

30
00:01:24,164 --> 00:01:27,132
and that he's in communication
with the Russians.

31
00:01:27,167 --> 00:01:28,934
Do you, now?

32
00:01:28,969 --> 00:01:30,902
I suppose there's only
one way to find out.

33
00:01:30,938 --> 00:01:34,005
Go. Pursue. Live the dream.

34
00:01:34,041 --> 00:01:35,173
But, Elizabeth...

35
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:38,576
don't disappoint me again.

36
00:01:42,008 --> 00:01:49,867

<font color=#00E6E6>S08E15</font></b>

39
00:02:17,517 --> 00:02:19,951
Anne? Stay with me.

40
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:27,425
Belsky reached out.
He said it's urgent.

41
00:02:29,229 --> 00:02:31,162
Anne had a daughter.

42
00:02:31,198 --> 00:02:32,831
Has a daughter.

43
00:02:32,866 --> 00:02:35,433
You must put that behind you.

44
00:02:35,469 --> 00:02:36,868
Belsky has information

45
00:02:36,903 --> 00:02:39,637
that concerns Townsend and Elizabeth.

46
00:02:39,673 --> 00:02:41,840
Then I suppose we'll act on it.

47
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:43,855
Raymond, there's something else.

48
00:02:44,884 --> 00:02:46,216
Paula called.

49
00:02:46,313 --> 00:02:47,746
Glen's mother, Paula?

50
00:02:47,781 --> 00:02:50,882
Yes. She wanted you to call
or come by the house.

51
00:02:50,917 --> 00:02:54,185
And then she said something
about "new irons in the fire."

52
00:02:54,221 --> 00:02:56,154
Hot ones, she said.

53
00:02:56,189 --> 00:02:57,922
Oh, my God. Sounds like she's dating.

54
00:02:57,958 --> 00:02:59,858
That's what I said.

55
00:02:59,893 --> 00:03:03,094
And she laughed and said,
"No, nothing like that.

56
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:05,130
This is business.

57
00:03:05,165 --> 00:03:07,432
Serious business."

58
00:03:07,467 --> 00:03:09,768
And then she said,
"Alright, then, Dembe.

59
00:03:09,803 --> 00:03:12,070
I'll see you and Raymond at the house."

60
00:03:12,105 --> 00:03:14,136
What happened to Bill and Steven?

61
00:03:15,242 --> 00:03:17,175
She knows, Raymond.

62
00:03:21,014 --> 00:03:22,644
Oh, my.

63
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:27,519
Histiaeus.

64
00:03:27,554 --> 00:03:29,054
What's to be learned from him,

65
00:03:29,089 --> 00:03:31,056
other than tyranny and duplicity?

66
00:03:31,091 --> 00:03:33,725
There you have it.
The history of mankind...

67
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,260
Tyranny and duplicity.

68
00:03:35,295 --> 00:03:37,429
You've come a long way

69
00:03:37,464 --> 00:03:40,031
from the 8th Directorate, comrade...

70
00:03:40,067 --> 00:03:41,733
Uh, Professor Belsky.

71
00:03:41,768 --> 00:03:43,835
Although I see your affinity

72
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:46,037
for authoritarians hasn't changed.

73
00:03:46,073 --> 00:03:49,340
Histiaeus wanted to organize a revolt

74
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:52,744
but feared discovery by the Persians,

75
00:03:52,779 --> 00:03:55,547
so he shaved the hair
of his favorite slave

76
00:03:55,582 --> 00:03:59,384
and had the treasonous message
tattooed on his head.

77
00:03:59,419 --> 00:04:00,652
When the hair grew back,

78
00:04:00,687 --> 00:04:02,620
he sent him off to spread the word,

79
00:04:02,656 --> 00:04:04,789
which became the first recorded act

80
00:04:04,825 --> 00:04:07,392
of steganography in warfare.

81
00:04:07,427 --> 00:04:09,294
Of course, my KGB ciphers

82
00:04:09,329 --> 00:04:13,064
are no more relevant today
than tattooing a head,

83
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,300
so you can imagine my surprise

84
00:04:15,335 --> 00:04:17,869
when I stumbled across this.

85
00:04:20,285 --> 00:04:22,073
I don't understand.
Are you getting leads

86
00:04:22,109 --> 00:04:24,209
from a psychic now?
- To predict the future?

87
00:04:24,244 --> 00:04:26,711
I don't know, Harold. At $5.99 a minute,

88
00:04:26,746 --> 00:04:29,814
Madame Zorba might be a bargain
at twice the price.

89
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:32,750
If there was a Madam Zorba.
But there isn't.

90
00:04:32,786 --> 00:04:34,285
You're showing me a fake ad?

91
00:04:34,321 --> 00:04:36,488
It's not an ad. It's a message.

92
00:04:36,523 --> 00:04:40,091
A code that I believe Townsend
and Elizabeth may be using

93
00:04:40,127 --> 00:04:42,327
to communicate with an associate.

94
00:04:42,362 --> 00:04:45,396
"Love is a knot that
even death cannot untie."

95
00:04:45,432 --> 00:04:47,465
It sounds more like
a Hallmark card than a code.

96
00:04:47,501 --> 00:04:49,467
Having failed to kill me,

97
00:04:49,503 --> 00:04:52,370
I suspect Elizabeth and Townsend
may be planning

98
00:04:52,405 --> 00:04:54,739
to move against those around me...

99
00:04:54,774 --> 00:04:58,309
In my world and possibly in yours.

100
00:04:58,345 --> 00:05:00,145
Her fight is with you, not us.

101
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,714
Yes, but you're with me,

102
00:05:02,749 --> 00:05:04,282
and she's with Townsend,

103
00:05:04,317 --> 00:05:06,684
who takes great pride in displaying

104
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,988
his utter disregard for human life.

105
00:05:10,023 --> 00:05:12,190
"Love is a knot" isn't an aphorism.

106
00:05:12,225 --> 00:05:15,994
It's a clue to decrypting the code.

107
00:05:16,029 --> 00:05:18,129
As you well know, during the Cold War,

108
00:05:18,165 --> 00:05:22,100
nobody mastered the art
of clandestine communication

109
00:05:22,135 --> 00:05:23,195
better than the Soviets,

110
00:05:23,234 --> 00:05:26,704
their pièce de résistance
being a cipher machine

111
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:29,741
capable of encrypting or decrypting text

112
00:05:29,776 --> 00:05:32,043
into 10 different languages.

113
00:05:32,078 --> 00:05:35,180
The Russkiy Uzel... The Russian Knot.

114
00:05:35,215 --> 00:05:36,814
The Kremlin destroyed most of them

115
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:39,617
just prior to the fall
of the Soviet Union,

116
00:05:39,653 --> 00:05:42,487
so Lord knows how Townsend
got his hands on one,

117
00:05:42,522 --> 00:05:46,124
but clearly he did, and if we
want to decrypt that message,

118
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:47,627
we need to get one, too.

119
00:05:47,651 --> 00:05:49,087
Somehow I don't think this is something

120
00:05:49,133 --> 00:05:50,261
we can order on Amazon.

121
00:05:50,297 --> 00:05:52,030
The only other machine I know of

122
00:05:52,065 --> 00:05:54,332
is on display in a museum in Minsk.

123
00:05:54,367 --> 00:05:56,901
Beautiful city. Amazing opera house.

124
00:05:56,937 --> 00:06:00,004
I'd forgotten how beautiful
until yesterday.

125
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,706
You were just in Minsk?
- Yes.

126
00:06:01,741 --> 00:06:05,743
In order to make a generous
donation to said museum

127
00:06:05,779 --> 00:06:08,146
from a private collection.

128
00:06:08,181 --> 00:06:10,081
Nana was born in Minsk.

129
00:06:10,116 --> 00:06:13,184
I can think of no better way
to honor her passing

130
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:15,320
than with this gift.

131
00:06:15,355 --> 00:06:17,116
You gave the museum a Cézanne?

132
00:06:17,149 --> 00:06:18,256
A stolen one,

133
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:21,726
which, like all good
and greedy bureaucrats,

134
00:06:21,761 --> 00:06:24,262
they're trying to decide
whether to report.

135
00:06:24,297 --> 00:06:26,364
Imagine their embarrassment

136
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:29,200
when the FBI finds it
in their possession.

137
00:06:29,236 --> 00:06:30,835
You donated the painting.

138
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:32,136
Now you want us to go and get it back.

139
00:06:32,172 --> 00:06:35,773
Yes. Along with the Russian Knot.

140
00:06:35,809 --> 00:06:37,308
And why would they give us that?

141
00:06:37,344 --> 00:06:40,912
Last I checked, your country
had sanctions in place

142
00:06:40,947 --> 00:06:44,082
against both the president
of Belarus and his son.

143
00:06:44,117 --> 00:06:46,264
They're not giving you anything.

144
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,119
You want us to steal it.
- Of course.

145
00:06:48,154 --> 00:06:50,769
What the hell do you think
we've been talking about?

146
00:06:54,992 --> 00:06:56,326
Okay, this cipher machine

147
00:06:56,361 --> 00:06:57,761
is actually The hpretty fascinating.

148
00:06:57,796 --> 00:06:59,929
You use the little keyboard
to type up your message,

149
00:06:59,965 --> 00:07:02,666
which it then jumbles
into a random series of letters.

150
00:07:02,701 --> 00:07:04,834
Then, on the receiving end,
you need another machine

151
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:07,170
to turn the gobbledygook
back into regular text.

152
00:07:07,205 --> 00:07:09,306
Okay, but this thing's
like 50 years old.

153
00:07:09,341 --> 00:07:11,608
I mean, can't you crack
the billboard code without it?

154
00:07:11,643 --> 00:07:14,044
Well, it's not exactly
Orphan Annie's decoder ring.

155
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:16,813
The complexity of the Knot's
algorithm compounds

156
00:07:16,848 --> 00:07:18,415
every letter after it is entered,

157
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:21,451
netting us a trillion,
trillion, trillion...

158
00:07:21,486 --> 00:07:23,153
...different possibilities.

159
00:07:23,188 --> 00:07:24,754
I know we'd like to find out what Keen

160
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:26,623
and Townsend are up to,
but are we really

161
00:07:26,658 --> 00:07:28,925
talking about robbing
the Belarusian War Museum?

162
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,794
I, uh... I feel like we've done worse.

163
00:07:30,829 --> 00:07:33,797
Reddington made it clear there's
no diplomatic angle here.

164
00:07:33,832 --> 00:07:35,565
Townsend has illicit relationships

165
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,900
with the Council of Ministers.

166
00:07:36,935 --> 00:07:38,568
If we reach out for help,
he'll be tipped.

167
00:07:38,603 --> 00:07:41,538
Yeah, but to what? We don't even
know what Keen's planning.

168
00:07:41,573 --> 00:07:43,206
Okay, Ruddiger, what do ya got?

169
00:07:43,241 --> 00:07:45,775
This bores through rock

170
00:07:45,811 --> 00:07:48,745
using ultrasonic vibrations.

171
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:56,986
Ha ha! Hell of a lot quieter, too.

172
00:07:57,022 --> 00:07:58,321
It's not very deep.

173
00:07:58,357 --> 00:08:00,256
Don't we need to get through
two feet of concrete?

174
00:08:00,292 --> 00:08:03,360
Only needs to be deep enough
for the SCDA to do its thing

175
00:08:03,395 --> 00:08:06,563
and to keep me
out of the boss's heavy bag.

176
00:08:06,598 --> 00:08:08,932
Of course, what you gain
in noise reduction,

177
00:08:08,967 --> 00:08:11,101
you lose in predictability.

178
00:08:11,136 --> 00:08:14,304
It takes time to heat up and expand,

179
00:08:14,339 --> 00:08:17,574
for the pressure to build,
until finally...

180
00:08:20,011 --> 00:08:21,311
Boom.

181
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:26,850
Talk to me about access.

182
00:08:26,885 --> 00:08:29,853
Once we're in, we need a way to
smuggle the cipher device out.

183
00:08:29,888 --> 00:08:32,789
The lab's mocking up a fake to
leave in its place as we speak.

184
00:08:32,824 --> 00:08:34,924
We'll need to loop the
security feeds to make the swap.

185
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,994
Okay, but how do we gain entry
into their security passage?

186
00:08:38,029 --> 00:08:39,496
Silva Terzian.

187
00:08:39,531 --> 00:08:41,331
Immigrated from Armenia.

188
00:08:41,366 --> 00:08:43,466
Gets a tea at the same café

189
00:08:43,502 --> 00:08:45,235
every morning before she goes to work.

190
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:46,603
She's our in.

191
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,773
Ho-ho!

192
00:08:50,942 --> 00:08:52,976
Pack it up. It's time to go.

193
00:08:53,011 --> 00:08:54,816
Wait. Like, now? Why so soon?

194
00:08:54,852 --> 00:08:56,346
The breach happens Friday night.

195
00:08:56,381 --> 00:08:58,248
That's when the museum
is hosting its fundraiser.

196
00:08:58,283 --> 00:09:00,250
Staff won't like the FBI presence,

197
00:09:00,285 --> 00:09:02,185
won't want to cause a scene
in front of the donors,

198
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:05,088
which means they're more likely
to fall for our diversion.

199
00:09:06,191 --> 00:09:07,991
Enjoy.
- Thanks.

200
00:09:10,495 --> 00:09:11,728
Oh!

201
00:09:11,763 --> 00:09:13,129
I am so sorry!

202
00:09:13,165 --> 00:09:14,497
No, it's okay.
- Let me help you with that.

203
00:09:14,533 --> 00:09:16,766
Don't...
- Don't worry about it.

204
00:09:18,904 --> 00:09:21,838
Oh, hey! You forgot your wallet.

205
00:09:21,873 --> 00:09:23,048
Thank you.

206
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:25,742
Anyone unclear? Any questions?

207
00:09:25,777 --> 00:09:28,244
I think the big question is,
what's Liz really up to?

208
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,646
If we're successful in bringing

209
00:09:29,681 --> 00:09:31,614
this device home from Minsk,

210
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:33,750
we have a good shot at finding out.

211
00:10:09,253 --> 00:10:11,087
Let me know if we have a problem.

212
00:10:15,927 --> 00:10:18,127
At the terminus, go left.

213
00:10:18,163 --> 00:10:19,863
Then straight ahead 200 feet.

214
00:10:19,898 --> 00:10:21,798
Once you're on site, you need to be

215
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:24,834
12 feet, 2 inches off the center
of the north wall.

216
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:29,539
Your credentials appear to be in order,

217
00:10:29,574 --> 00:10:31,608
but I'm afraid you're
in the wrong country.

218
00:10:31,643 --> 00:10:33,533
I go wherever he takes me.

219
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:35,645
Notorious fugitive Raymond Reddington.

220
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,181
I'm told you accepted
a stolen painting from him.

221
00:10:38,216 --> 00:10:40,049
He called himself Lloyd Wilke.

222
00:10:40,085 --> 00:10:41,518
I could alert INTERPOL.

223
00:10:41,553 --> 00:10:43,319
I'm sure they'd love
to swarm your museum

224
00:10:43,355 --> 00:10:46,055
and arrest you as an accomplice
after the fact.

225
00:10:46,091 --> 00:10:48,858
But that might kill the mood
of this lovely evening.

226
00:10:48,894 --> 00:10:50,760
Yes. That would be terrible.

227
00:10:50,795 --> 00:10:52,495
Or you could have your people
show my team

228
00:10:52,531 --> 00:10:55,698
your security feeds
while I look at that Cézanne.

229
00:11:16,354 --> 00:11:17,520
Four minutes.

230
00:11:17,556 --> 00:11:19,322
Alright. You get started.

231
00:11:19,357 --> 00:11:21,157
I got the sensors.

232
00:11:26,398 --> 00:11:28,364
Beautiful city, by the way.

233
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,968
It's true what they say.
Minsk isn't just concrete.

234
00:11:32,003 --> 00:11:33,636
There is some really beautiful concrete.

235
00:11:33,672 --> 00:11:37,407
Hey, Aram. It's Cooper.
Something about a legal attaché.

236
00:11:37,442 --> 00:11:39,442
We'll catch up in a second.
- Alright.

237
00:11:44,482 --> 00:11:46,616
_

238
00:11:46,651 --> 00:11:48,142
_

239
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:49,584
_

240
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:51,503
_

241
00:11:51,527 --> 00:11:52,998
_

242
00:11:53,022 --> 00:11:54,524
_

243
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:56,125
Not trying to cowboy anyone, guys.

244
00:11:56,161 --> 00:11:58,461
Just want to take
a quick peek at the footage.

245
00:12:22,721 --> 00:12:25,288
_

246
00:12:25,323 --> 00:12:27,915
_

247
00:12:27,939 --> 00:12:29,939
_

248
00:12:30,923 --> 00:12:32,306
_

249
00:12:34,435 --> 00:12:35,689
_

250
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:38,174
_

251
00:12:39,304 --> 00:12:41,537
_

252
00:12:44,843 --> 00:12:47,844
Sensors are down.

253
00:12:53,585 --> 00:12:55,184
They're here.
- Who's here?

254
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,352
The Task Force.

255
00:12:56,388 --> 00:12:57,820
What the hell are they doing here?

256
00:12:57,856 --> 00:12:58,921
What do you think?

257
00:12:58,957 --> 00:13:00,423
Reddington must have sent them

258
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:02,992
to get the device before we can.

259
00:13:03,028 --> 00:13:04,427
We have to hurry.

260
00:13:13,271 --> 00:13:14,971
Hey, Aram, we're in place.

261
00:13:15,009 --> 00:13:16,372
Okay, just give me a minute to record

262
00:13:16,408 --> 00:13:18,875
enough footage to loop the feeds.

263
00:13:27,528 --> 00:13:29,083
_

264
00:13:29,114 --> 00:13:30,683
_

265
00:13:33,638 --> 00:13:34,790
_

266
00:13:40,365 --> 00:13:43,533
Okay. The cameras are bypassed.
You're good to go.

267
00:13:47,105 --> 00:13:49,839
Hurry, hurry.
- Okay. Any minute now.

268
00:13:50,885 --> 00:13:51,908
Don't answer that.

269
00:13:51,943 --> 00:13:53,643
It's about to blow.

270
00:13:53,678 --> 00:13:55,311
What...

271
00:13:55,346 --> 00:13:56,412
Hello?

272
00:13:56,448 --> 00:13:57,814
I just had a dream about you.

273
00:13:57,849 --> 00:13:59,449
I'm sorry, Neville.
Now's not a good time.

274
00:13:59,484 --> 00:14:01,451
No, don't interrupt or I'll forget.

275
00:14:01,486 --> 00:14:02,852
I was at a wedding,

276
00:14:02,887 --> 00:14:05,188
about to greet the bride and groom,

277
00:14:05,223 --> 00:14:06,689
but everyone was crying.

278
00:14:06,725 --> 00:14:08,958
And suddenly I realized...
This isn't a wedding.

279
00:14:08,993 --> 00:14:10,393
It's a funeral.

280
00:14:13,064 --> 00:14:14,764
Aram, we're ready to open the case.

281
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:16,099
Are the sensors down?

282
00:14:16,134 --> 00:14:17,633
Uh, guys? This is weird,

283
00:14:17,669 --> 00:14:19,469
but the sensors are already off.

284
00:14:25,876 --> 00:14:27,276
I hate funerals.

285
00:14:27,312 --> 00:14:30,213
I'm absolutely squeamish
about open caskets.

286
00:14:30,248 --> 00:14:32,482
I was terrified. And that's when I felt

287
00:14:32,517 --> 00:14:34,083
someone squeeze my hand.

288
00:14:34,119 --> 00:14:36,519
And it was you.
You were holding my hand.

289
00:14:36,554 --> 00:14:38,187
And I wasn't afraid anymore.

290
00:14:38,223 --> 00:14:39,789
Oh, and guess who was in the casket.

291
00:14:39,824 --> 00:14:41,624
I don't know.
- Reddington.

292
00:14:41,659 --> 00:14:44,327
And he looked hideous,
all sunken and yellow.

293
00:14:44,362 --> 00:14:45,661
I'm sorry, Neville. I really have to...

294
00:14:45,697 --> 00:14:47,497
I know I was harsh before,

295
00:14:47,532 --> 00:14:49,632
but this dream is a good sign.

296
00:14:49,667 --> 00:14:52,902
I am rooting for you, Elizabeth.

297
00:14:52,937 --> 00:14:54,904
I gotta go.

298
00:14:54,939 --> 00:14:56,873
He said he had a dream about me.

299
00:14:56,908 --> 00:14:58,508
He is creepy.

300
00:15:04,449 --> 00:15:06,349
What the hell's going on?

301
00:15:20,632 --> 00:15:22,064
Okay.

302
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:27,003
Run.

303
00:15:31,451 --> 00:15:33,102
Ahh!
- What are you doing?

304
00:15:33,137 --> 00:15:34,820
The badge. I left it
in the furnace room.

305
00:15:34,855 --> 00:15:36,072
Forget the badge!
- We can't get through

306
00:15:36,096 --> 00:15:37,154
the security gate without it.

307
00:15:37,189 --> 00:15:38,891
We'll go on foot!
- I'll be back.

308
00:15:38,926 --> 00:15:40,159
I'll meet you in the van.

309
00:15:40,194 --> 00:15:42,027
Ugh.

310
00:15:42,062 --> 00:15:44,396
It's her. She's in the
building. Keen's got the cipher!

311
00:15:44,431 --> 00:15:45,898
Aram, tell me you have eyes.

312
00:15:45,933 --> 00:15:48,200
Got her. Basement,
near the east stairwell.

313
00:15:48,235 --> 00:15:50,769
Agent Park is right around the corner.

314
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,693
Oh, no.

315
00:16:06,453 --> 00:16:08,659
It really is a lovely piece.

316
00:16:21,769 --> 00:16:22,834
Ahh!

317
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:37,549
I always wanted a hero moment.

318
00:16:37,585 --> 00:16:39,651
I got the badge.

319
00:16:41,302 --> 00:16:43,736
Let's go! Grab the Knot!

320
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:45,424
Yeah, I got it. I'm right behind you.

321
00:16:48,128 --> 00:16:49,761
Where's Park?

322
00:16:50,664 --> 00:16:52,531
What, are you gonna shoot me?

323
00:16:52,566 --> 00:16:54,199
For this?
- You don't understand.

324
00:16:54,235 --> 00:16:56,668
I'm dead without the device
that's in that bag.

325
00:16:56,704 --> 00:16:59,938
Shoot me, then. Show me there's
nothing left of the old Elizabeth Keen.

326
00:16:59,974 --> 00:17:02,507
The cipher. I have to have it.

327
00:17:02,543 --> 00:17:04,109
Why? You mean for Townsend

328
00:17:04,144 --> 00:17:06,426
so we can't read his messages?

329
00:17:06,914 --> 00:17:08,344
Townsend?

330
00:17:09,554 --> 00:17:11,222
He doesn't know I'm...

331
00:17:12,306 --> 00:17:14,086
Why would you say that?

332
00:17:14,121 --> 00:17:15,520
Liz, where are you?

333
00:17:15,556 --> 00:17:17,422
Liz, we need to go right now.

334
00:17:22,896 --> 00:17:24,329
Park!

335
00:17:24,365 --> 00:17:25,864
Hey.

336
00:17:29,737 --> 00:17:31,688
Is she okay?
- Yeah. I'm okay.

337
00:17:31,751 --> 00:17:34,406
Where's Liz? Where'd she go?

338
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,853
You're not taking the painting?

339
00:17:47,888 --> 00:17:49,788
My concern is finding Reddington.

340
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:51,690
Agents from our Art Theft unit
will be in touch,

341
00:17:51,725 --> 00:17:53,458
and they'll want to discuss the details.

342
00:17:53,494 --> 00:17:55,127
Excuse me.

343
00:17:56,597 --> 00:17:58,530
We got a problem.

344
00:17:58,565 --> 00:17:59,998
What kind of problem?

345
00:18:00,034 --> 00:18:01,366
A Liz Keen problem.

346
00:18:03,604 --> 00:18:07,172
My pumpkin cheesecake thumbprints

347
00:18:07,207 --> 00:18:09,408
are sort of legendary.

348
00:18:09,443 --> 00:18:11,310
They were Glen's favorite.

349
00:18:11,345 --> 00:18:12,783
Thank you, Paula.

350
00:18:13,213 --> 00:18:14,780
Yes. Thank you, Paula.

351
00:18:14,815 --> 00:18:18,016
You're welcome, Steve, Bill.

352
00:18:19,086 --> 00:18:22,251
Paula, is there anything
you'd like to tell us?

353
00:18:23,136 --> 00:18:25,303
I used canned pumpkin.

354
00:18:25,328 --> 00:18:26,923
Ahh.

355
00:18:28,095 --> 00:18:30,295
You know who I am.

356
00:18:30,331 --> 00:18:31,630
I do.

357
00:18:31,665 --> 00:18:33,598
I am so sorry.

358
00:18:33,634 --> 00:18:36,034
I know it's a big secret.

359
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:38,392
How did you find out, Paula?

360
00:18:39,239 --> 00:18:44,443
I found this under Jelly's bed.

361
00:18:44,478 --> 00:18:46,678
I say "manuscript,"

362
00:18:46,714 --> 00:18:49,748
but it's really more of a memoir.

363
00:18:49,783 --> 00:18:51,550
Glen was writing a book?

364
00:18:51,585 --> 00:18:53,652
About your time together,

365
00:18:53,687 --> 00:18:57,356
the hijinks and shenanigans.

366
00:18:57,391 --> 00:18:58,757
Oh, don't worry.

367
00:18:58,792 --> 00:19:01,593
I don't think he sent it
to any publishers yet.

368
00:19:01,628 --> 00:19:03,228
I can't believe this.

369
00:19:03,263 --> 00:19:06,398
I can.
- Me too!

370
00:19:06,433 --> 00:19:08,133
It makes a whole lot more sense

371
00:19:08,168 --> 00:19:12,671
than Jelly being Huey Lewis' muse.

372
00:19:12,706 --> 00:19:15,780
Paula, why are you
telling me all of this now?

373
00:19:15,808 --> 00:19:17,042
That's the thing.

374
00:19:17,077 --> 00:19:20,912
I've been retired from Ma Bell
for some time now,

375
00:19:20,948 --> 00:19:23,548
and I've been keeping to my budget,

376
00:19:23,584 --> 00:19:28,587
but after Jelly died,
without his income,

377
00:19:28,622 --> 00:19:34,459
um, things have gotten sort of... tight.

378
00:19:34,495 --> 00:19:37,662
Now, I-I'm not asking for a handout.

379
00:19:37,698 --> 00:19:42,033
I went back to work
at the phone company part-time,

380
00:19:42,069 --> 00:19:45,570
but if you could maybe lend me...

381
00:19:45,606 --> 00:19:47,038
How much do you need?

382
00:19:47,074 --> 00:19:49,841
$172.

383
00:19:49,877 --> 00:19:53,545
And I'll pay it back with interest.

384
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:57,983
Or I could work it off,
pressing that suit

385
00:19:58,018 --> 00:20:02,954
or maybe cooking you two
a nice cream can dinner.

386
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:06,525
Well, that does sound nice,
but, Paula, this is a gift...

387
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:10,729
One I offer you in exchange
for your continued discretion.

388
00:20:10,764 --> 00:20:15,300
No gifts. I have to insist
on paying you back.

389
00:20:15,335 --> 00:20:19,938
Then let's just say I'm
purchasing Glen's manuscript.

390
00:20:23,977 --> 00:20:26,745
Well, that would mean a lot to him.

391
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:29,448
You say you've gone back to work
at the phone company?

392
00:20:29,483 --> 00:20:32,250
Yeah, the cellular one, the big one.

393
00:20:32,286 --> 00:20:34,519
18 hours a week now.

394
00:20:34,555 --> 00:20:36,488
Why do you ask?

395
00:20:41,361 --> 00:20:42,861
What on earth?

396
00:20:42,896 --> 00:20:44,596
Reddington must have
donated the painting

397
00:20:44,631 --> 00:20:45,864
so he could case the museum.

398
00:20:45,899 --> 00:20:47,332
What do you think he was after?

399
00:20:47,367 --> 00:20:49,023
The Russian Knot.

400
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:51,570
That machine is one-of-a-kind.

401
00:20:51,605 --> 00:20:52,771
Lucky we stopped him.

402
00:20:52,806 --> 00:20:54,940
Yes. Thank God for the FBI.

403
00:20:54,975 --> 00:20:57,576
Your local police are gonna
want to secure the area.

404
00:20:57,611 --> 00:20:59,478
We should clear everyone out.

405
00:21:08,789 --> 00:21:10,961
Tell me that was the fake.

406
00:21:11,525 --> 00:21:14,125
Hm. Thank God for the FBI.

407
00:21:20,046 --> 00:21:21,332
We got the device,

408
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:23,235
and the Art Theft unit got the Cézanne.

409
00:21:23,259 --> 00:21:24,892
Excellent. Please tell me

410
00:21:24,927 --> 00:21:26,260
you made it to the opera.

411
00:21:26,295 --> 00:21:28,129
We didn't. Keen made sure of that.

412
00:21:28,164 --> 00:21:30,264
Oh, of course. She was there.

413
00:21:30,299 --> 00:21:33,601
That's what I can't square...
Is the "of course" of it all.

414
00:21:33,636 --> 00:21:35,169
You told me that she and Townsend

415
00:21:35,204 --> 00:21:38,639
were using one of these devices
to encrypt their communiqués,

416
00:21:38,674 --> 00:21:40,741
that you'd intercepted those communiqués

417
00:21:40,777 --> 00:21:42,843
but couldn't decrypt them
unless we went to Minsk

418
00:21:42,879 --> 00:21:44,478
and got the other device.

419
00:21:44,514 --> 00:21:47,360
Something Elizabeth would never
have wanted you to do.

420
00:21:47,395 --> 00:21:49,950
What I can't square is how
she knew we were doing it.

421
00:21:49,986 --> 00:21:51,886
Or why, when I mentioned
Townsend's name,

422
00:21:51,921 --> 00:21:54,321
Keen acted like he had no idea
she was there.

423
00:21:54,357 --> 00:21:56,223
Well, I can't speak to any of that,

424
00:21:56,259 --> 00:21:58,459
but all that matters
is that you have the device

425
00:21:58,494 --> 00:22:00,861
and I have the ability
to show you how to use it

426
00:22:00,897 --> 00:22:03,030
to read the text on that billboard,

427
00:22:03,065 --> 00:22:04,932
which I'll do as soon as I finish

428
00:22:04,967 --> 00:22:06,634
with a pressing appointment.

429
00:22:06,669 --> 00:22:09,737
More pressing than stopping
Townsend and finding Elizabeth?

430
00:22:09,772 --> 00:22:11,612
For the moment.

431
00:22:11,644 --> 00:22:13,674
Paula, tell me something good.

432
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:18,245
Well, you know Ernie in billing
has had his eye on me

433
00:22:18,281 --> 00:22:20,114
since his missus passed,

434
00:22:20,149 --> 00:22:24,919
so I took him up on an offer
to have dinner at Perkins.

435
00:22:24,954 --> 00:22:27,288
I sort of sweet-talked him.

436
00:22:27,323 --> 00:22:31,431
Anyway, I told him I did
one of those spit tests,

437
00:22:31,466 --> 00:22:33,894
found out I had a half-sister,

438
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:37,882
and was just desperate
to get an address.

439
00:22:43,372 --> 00:22:44,938
Emma Foster.

440
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,221
Date of birth, address, phone number.

441
00:22:48,344 --> 00:22:50,311
And he just went and got it for you?

442
00:22:50,346 --> 00:22:55,649
I always told Jelly
you get more bees with honey.

443
00:22:55,685 --> 00:22:57,718
You are the bee's knees, Paula.

444
00:23:00,022 --> 00:23:01,388
Oh, and what's this?

445
00:23:01,424 --> 00:23:03,404
A receipt from Perkins.

446
00:23:03,455 --> 00:23:05,392
If it's not too much,

447
00:23:05,428 --> 00:23:08,166
I'd like to get reimbursed
for the chicken dinner.

448
00:23:08,202 --> 00:23:10,467
Ernie wanted to go Dutch.

449
00:23:10,491 --> 00:23:12,201
Ugh. Ernie.

450
00:23:19,219 --> 00:23:21,450
Ressler.
- Reddington's lying to you.

451
00:23:21,474 --> 00:23:24,048
You want to tell me about it?
How about you turn yourself in?

452
00:23:24,115 --> 00:23:27,083
He told you I wanted
the device to keep him

453
00:23:27,118 --> 00:23:28,985
from reading messages
between me and Townsend.

454
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:30,520
Yeah, a theory you proved

455
00:23:30,555 --> 00:23:31,821
by trying to prevent us from getting it.

456
00:23:31,856 --> 00:23:34,691
I wasn't there to keep you
from reading my messages.

457
00:23:34,726 --> 00:23:37,527
I was there to get it
so that I could read his.

458
00:23:37,562 --> 00:23:39,095
Wait. The billboard's his?

459
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:41,431
Billboard? I don't know anything
about a billboard.

460
00:23:41,466 --> 00:23:44,934
What I know is Reddington uses
the Knot to decrypt messages

461
00:23:44,969 --> 00:23:47,236
in classified ads
in The Washington Post.

462
00:23:47,272 --> 00:23:49,588
If he's decrypting messages
using a Russian Knot,

463
00:23:49,634 --> 00:23:51,908
then why send us to Minsk
to get another one?

464
00:23:51,943 --> 00:23:54,243
So that I couldn't read
what he and his handler

465
00:23:54,279 --> 00:23:55,511
are saying to each other.

466
00:23:55,547 --> 00:23:56,946
That's who he's talking to.

467
00:23:56,981 --> 00:23:59,348
If I can prove he's talking
to the Russians...

468
00:23:59,384 --> 00:24:00,683
You can prove he's N-13.

469
00:24:00,719 --> 00:24:04,187
I am not the enemy. He is.

470
00:24:04,222 --> 00:24:07,190
Please. Let me prove it to you.

471
00:24:08,927 --> 00:24:10,560
Keen wants to meet.

472
00:24:10,595 --> 00:24:12,962
What she wants is to destroy the device

473
00:24:12,997 --> 00:24:15,064
so we can't know what
she and Townsend are planning.

474
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:17,233
No, I think she wants
to use the device to prove

475
00:24:17,268 --> 00:24:19,936
that Reddington's communicating
with his Russian handler.

476
00:24:19,971 --> 00:24:21,938
I feel like we should
at least hear her out.

477
00:24:21,973 --> 00:24:24,240
You think we should give her a big hug.

478
00:24:24,275 --> 00:24:26,109
She probably needs one.

479
00:24:26,144 --> 00:24:28,878
Look, the Russian Knot
is a relic of the Cold War

480
00:24:28,913 --> 00:24:30,847
that creates an analog code.

481
00:24:30,882 --> 00:24:33,216
Newspaper classifieds
barely exist anymore.

482
00:24:33,251 --> 00:24:35,384
This sounds a lot more
like Mr. Reddington

483
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:38,287
than it does Agent Keen
or Neville Townsend.

484
00:24:38,323 --> 00:24:40,923
I appreciate your reluctance,
Agent Park,

485
00:24:40,959 --> 00:24:43,059
but if there's a chance
this could finally prove

486
00:24:43,094 --> 00:24:44,994
that Reddington's a Russian agent,

487
00:24:45,029 --> 00:24:47,263
I think we need to hear
what Agent Keen has to say.

488
00:24:47,298 --> 00:24:49,599
She's gonna want to know
that I have your word on this,

489
00:24:49,634 --> 00:24:51,601
that we're not gonna double-cross her.

490
00:24:51,636 --> 00:24:53,603
You have it. Now call her back.

491
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,747
Cooper signed off. Tell me
how this is gonna work.

492
00:25:04,783 --> 00:25:08,217
Grab a pen. And listen carefully.

493
00:25:10,989 --> 00:25:12,989
This is Assistant Director
Harold Cooper,

494
00:25:13,024 --> 00:25:15,725
authorization code 39587.

495
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,627
I need to requisition a team

496
00:25:17,662 --> 00:25:19,462
for surveillance and apprehension.

497
00:25:29,507 --> 00:25:30,888
Who is it?

498
00:25:31,509 --> 00:25:33,307
Emma Foster?

499
00:25:33,845 --> 00:25:35,211
Who's asking?

500
00:25:35,246 --> 00:25:40,216
My name is Farwell Smith.
Your mother's attorney.

501
00:25:43,621 --> 00:25:45,321
You worked with my mom?

502
00:25:45,356 --> 00:25:49,325
I helped her with
some of her estate planning.

503
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,160
She never mentioned you.

504
00:25:51,196 --> 00:25:54,864
Most of my clients don't
mention me to their children.

505
00:25:54,899 --> 00:25:58,666
Wills and trusts can be awkward.

506
00:25:59,103 --> 00:26:01,037
It's all part of the job,

507
00:26:01,877 --> 00:26:03,840
in order to deliver
a little bit of good news

508
00:26:03,875 --> 00:26:07,341
at an otherwise mournful time.

509
00:26:08,847 --> 00:26:10,847
M-Mournful?

510
00:26:12,817 --> 00:26:16,285
I'm... I'm sorry. I thought you knew.

511
00:26:19,724 --> 00:26:21,691
Anne passed away.

512
00:26:34,239 --> 00:26:37,406
I am so sorry for your loss.

513
00:26:50,632 --> 00:26:52,066
Hey, Keen. I'm here.

514
00:26:52,102 --> 00:26:53,267
There's a man selling pretzels

515
00:26:53,303 --> 00:26:54,936
at the 72nd street crossover

516
00:26:54,971 --> 00:26:56,971
above the fountain. Buy one.

517
00:26:57,006 --> 00:26:58,439
He's headed into the park.

518
00:26:58,475 --> 00:27:00,475
Keen knows our vehicles
will have to pull back.

519
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:01,976
Beta team, stand down.

520
00:27:02,011 --> 00:27:04,178
Delta, can you go on foot?

521
00:27:10,019 --> 00:27:12,153
Drop your cell in the trash.

522
00:27:17,536 --> 00:27:20,128
Down the steps, by the fountain.

523
00:27:22,705 --> 00:27:24,705
I don't have a visual.
Somebody get me eyes.

524
00:27:24,741 --> 00:27:27,041
Beta, clear emergency access.

525
00:27:38,655 --> 00:27:40,684
So you have bodyguards now.

526
00:27:41,491 --> 00:27:42,924
Is that it?

527
00:27:42,959 --> 00:27:44,458
You have Reddington's ad?

528
00:27:45,995 --> 00:27:49,764
Did Reddington tell you
how he knew I'd be in Minsk?

529
00:27:49,799 --> 00:27:51,999
I think he thinks I told you.

530
00:27:52,035 --> 00:27:54,168
Guess that's the romantic in him.

531
00:27:56,839 --> 00:27:58,806
Okay. Enter the number first.

532
00:27:58,841 --> 00:28:00,704
That belong to your mother?

533
00:28:02,845 --> 00:28:05,646
Please tell me that you
at least tried calling that.

534
00:28:05,682 --> 00:28:07,315
It's not a phone number. It's a key

535
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:09,317
meant to orient the machine's settings.

536
00:28:09,352 --> 00:28:11,619
And, yes, this book
belonged to my mother,

537
00:28:11,654 --> 00:28:14,222
along with a storage locker
filled with half-solved clues

538
00:28:14,257 --> 00:28:18,125
about Reddington and a series
of encrypted messages.

539
00:28:18,161 --> 00:28:20,127
There's more than one?

540
00:28:20,163 --> 00:28:24,131
And if we can decrypt this one,
we can decrypt all of them.

541
00:28:24,167 --> 00:28:26,033
Okay. Now what?

542
00:28:26,069 --> 00:28:29,604
The circled letters, in order.

543
00:28:30,705 --> 00:28:32,340
I have eyes. Should we move in?

544
00:28:32,375 --> 00:28:34,608
Yes, but keep your distance
until units are in place.

545
00:28:34,634 --> 00:28:35,977
We don't know what kind
of protection she has,

546
00:28:36,012 --> 00:28:37,378
and I want to keep this clean.

547
00:28:37,413 --> 00:28:40,514
C. M. A.

548
00:28:41,144 --> 00:28:42,516
That's it.

549
00:28:46,863 --> 00:28:49,497
You okay? Keen, what is it?

550
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,859
I don't know how Reddington
knew I was coming.

551
00:28:51,894 --> 00:28:54,466
I don't know how he knows
half the things he does.

552
00:28:55,198 --> 00:28:58,011
But I do know that I'm right about this.

553
00:28:58,601 --> 00:29:00,501
I just wish you'd believe me.

554
00:29:00,536 --> 00:29:02,036
I do believe you.

555
00:29:03,473 --> 00:29:05,873
I wish you didn't need proof.

556
00:29:15,585 --> 00:29:17,151
That's the message?

557
00:29:17,186 --> 00:29:18,352
Numbers?

558
00:29:18,388 --> 00:29:20,534
I don't understand.

559
00:29:21,491 --> 00:29:22,857
Maybe we did it wrong.

560
00:29:22,892 --> 00:29:25,092
I mean, maybe we need to try again.

561
00:29:28,898 --> 00:29:32,333
Damn it. Keen, hey! This isn't me!

562
00:29:32,368 --> 00:29:33,834
Hey!
- Send them in. Now.

563
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:36,203
We're made. Go. Now! Move in.

564
00:29:36,239 --> 00:29:39,073
Keen, wait! They lied to me!

565
00:29:43,246 --> 00:29:45,613
Keen. Hey. Stop.

566
00:29:45,648 --> 00:29:47,581
Stop. Keen, they lied to me.

567
00:29:47,617 --> 00:29:49,450
I had no idea. I swear.

568
00:29:52,622 --> 00:29:54,221
Oh, my God.

569
00:30:05,835 --> 00:30:07,868
She's somewhere under the terrace.

570
00:30:07,904 --> 00:30:11,038
All units, move in.
I repeat, move in now.

571
00:30:31,294 --> 00:30:34,107
This can't be right.

572
00:30:34,931 --> 00:30:37,898
Your mother had a considerable estate.

573
00:30:37,934 --> 00:30:40,701
We talked about it
as recently as a year ago.

574
00:30:40,737 --> 00:30:45,272
I was gonna get like $3,000,
not $3 million.

575
00:30:45,308 --> 00:30:49,477
Perhaps she wanted it
to be a pleasant surprise.

576
00:30:50,123 --> 00:30:53,180
Did you know she was in love
with a wanted fugitive?

577
00:30:55,017 --> 00:30:56,517
She told you that?

578
00:30:56,552 --> 00:30:58,921
She called last week, about him

579
00:30:58,957 --> 00:31:02,990
and how these people had come to
where she lived to kill him.

580
00:31:03,025 --> 00:31:05,493
I tried asking her what was going on,

581
00:31:05,528 --> 00:31:08,295
but all she wanted was
for me to protect myself,

582
00:31:08,331 --> 00:31:10,264
that the people who were after him

583
00:31:10,299 --> 00:31:12,933
might come after her or me.

584
00:31:12,969 --> 00:31:15,169
I thought it was crazy talk.

585
00:31:15,204 --> 00:31:18,527
But she insisted
I drop everything and...

586
00:31:19,475 --> 00:31:21,780
go into hiding.

587
00:31:22,545 --> 00:31:24,211
So I came here

588
00:31:24,247 --> 00:31:25,846
and waited.

589
00:31:25,882 --> 00:31:27,815
She told me she was hoping
to stay with a friend

590
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:29,746
in a cabin on a lake,

591
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:33,250
and she'd call me
when everything settled down.

592
00:31:33,856 --> 00:31:36,424
That was the last time
I ever spoke to her.

593
00:31:40,797 --> 00:31:42,801
I don't know what to say.

594
00:31:45,034 --> 00:31:46,722
Did you know her well?

595
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:49,032
I did.

596
00:31:49,739 --> 00:31:52,473
Then you can understand
why I want to remember

597
00:31:52,508 --> 00:31:54,341
her love and kindness,

598
00:31:54,377 --> 00:31:56,877
not her connection to a criminal.

599
00:31:56,913 --> 00:31:59,735
I can't do that if any
of this money comes from him.

600
00:32:00,694 --> 00:32:02,988
Can you promise me that it doesn't?

601
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:07,000
I can't promise you that.

602
00:32:09,058 --> 00:32:12,927
But I can promise you that your mother

603
00:32:12,962 --> 00:32:15,696
wanted you to have everything

604
00:32:15,731 --> 00:32:17,961
that she could possibly give you.

605
00:32:18,634 --> 00:32:21,256
That would include this.

606
00:32:22,038 --> 00:32:23,550
Think about it.

607
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:27,074
You could always donate it to charity,

608
00:32:27,109 --> 00:32:29,222
set up a scholarship.

609
00:32:29,946 --> 00:32:31,600
Put on a play.

610
00:32:32,248 --> 00:32:35,583
At the very least, pay all your bills,

611
00:32:35,618 --> 00:32:39,753
buy something for yourself,
and then, if you want,

612
00:32:39,789 --> 00:32:42,423
you can give the rest of it away.

613
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,864
Just think about it.

614
00:32:53,102 --> 00:32:54,998
How did she die?

615
00:32:58,808 --> 00:33:00,629
It was an accident.

616
00:33:01,811 --> 00:33:03,711
Caused by the fugitive?

617
00:33:03,746 --> 00:33:05,050
No.

618
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:11,723
But he... He was responsible.

619
00:33:14,824 --> 00:33:18,355
Tell me, a man like that...

620
00:33:18,895 --> 00:33:21,762
Do you think he'll ever get
what's coming to him?

621
00:33:27,303 --> 00:33:28,782
I do.

622
00:33:34,193 --> 00:33:36,486
You're crazy. You do know that.

623
00:33:36,511 --> 00:33:38,628
I like to think of it as determined.

624
00:33:38,675 --> 00:33:40,408
Yeah, determined to get yourself killed.

625
00:33:40,443 --> 00:33:43,277
And for what?
We couldn't crack the code.

626
00:33:43,313 --> 00:33:46,147
You had the messages
and the machine to decrypt it,

627
00:33:46,182 --> 00:33:47,381
and what did you get?

628
00:33:47,417 --> 00:33:48,950
A whole lot of nothing.

629
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:50,551
I must be missing a step...

630
00:33:50,587 --> 00:33:52,520
An input my mom didn't know about.

631
00:33:52,555 --> 00:33:54,355
Say there is, and we figured it out.

632
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:57,258
You think the FBI's letting you
near that machine again?

633
00:33:57,293 --> 00:33:58,960
Ressler gave you a shot.

634
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:00,828
He's not giving you another one.

635
00:34:02,265 --> 00:34:04,732
How did Reddington know
we'd be in Minsk?

636
00:34:04,768 --> 00:34:06,901
We didn't tell anybody.

637
00:34:06,936 --> 00:34:09,170
We found the folder of classified ads.

638
00:34:09,205 --> 00:34:12,573
We reviewed my mom's notes
on encryption.

639
00:34:12,609 --> 00:34:14,976
We were told we needed
the Russian Knot to decrypt it,

640
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:16,844
and we went to Minsk to try and get it,

641
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:19,714
but where's the opening
for Reddington in that?

642
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:23,564
Belsky.
- Belsky.

643
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,386
We trusted you.

644
00:34:25,421 --> 00:34:28,556
And I value that trust,
but I value my life more.

645
00:34:28,591 --> 00:34:30,057
Which is why you told Reddington.

646
00:34:30,093 --> 00:34:32,760
I was told to report
any inquiry about a code

647
00:34:32,796 --> 00:34:35,196
that requires the Russian Knot
to decrypt.

648
00:34:35,231 --> 00:34:38,299
He was quite clear on how
important that was to him,

649
00:34:38,334 --> 00:34:39,734
and I know what that means.

650
00:34:39,769 --> 00:34:42,837
So the minute we showed you
the ads, you showed him.

651
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:45,573
She heard I was an expert

652
00:34:45,608 --> 00:34:47,108
on the Russian Knot.

653
00:34:47,143 --> 00:34:49,010
She knew the ads were a code

654
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:51,779
and was hoping I could decrypt them.

655
00:34:51,815 --> 00:34:55,716
"Mid-30s. Brown hair. Blue eyes."

656
00:34:55,752 --> 00:34:57,518
Well, I didn't tell him it was you,

657
00:34:57,554 --> 00:34:59,153
but he seemed to know that already.

658
00:34:59,189 --> 00:35:00,655
You told me I needed

659
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:02,790
a Russian Knot to decrypt the message.

660
00:35:02,826 --> 00:35:04,992
Well, I got one,
and I still can't read it!

661
00:35:05,028 --> 00:35:07,361
There are keys.
You need them to read the code.

662
00:35:07,397 --> 00:35:08,696
I had them. The phone number.

663
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:10,665
Well, maybe there are more,

664
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,300
or the ones you had were wrong.

665
00:35:12,335 --> 00:35:14,202
Well, give me the right ones, then!

666
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:15,903
I don't know them!

667
00:35:15,939 --> 00:35:17,939
Well, then find me a person who does!

668
00:35:17,974 --> 00:35:20,007
The only person who has the keys

669
00:35:20,043 --> 00:35:23,010
is the one who encrypted the message.

670
00:35:23,046 --> 00:35:24,812
Reddington.

671
00:35:24,848 --> 00:35:26,347
Great.

672
00:35:28,017 --> 00:35:29,784
Is there anything on Elizabeth?

673
00:35:29,819 --> 00:35:31,085
Not a word.

674
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,754
Dembe has the faith
that comes from belief.

675
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:36,057
All I have are questions.

676
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:39,460
Why, how, what for, was it worth it?

677
00:35:39,495 --> 00:35:40,962
The answer's no.

678
00:35:40,997 --> 00:35:44,632
Whatever the outcome,
it most certainly was not.

679
00:35:44,667 --> 00:35:46,067
Well, at least you have it.

680
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:49,804
I do. Along with the hope
that I'm not being played.

681
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:56,010
Alright. First, type in
the telephone number.

682
00:35:57,213 --> 00:36:00,548
I assume the Cézanne has been
returned to its rightful place

683
00:36:00,583 --> 00:36:03,184
at the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford?

684
00:36:03,219 --> 00:36:04,819
It has.

685
00:36:04,854 --> 00:36:09,590
Now the first letter
of each word in order.

686
00:36:09,626 --> 00:36:11,859
I gave up the commission on the sale

687
00:36:11,895 --> 00:36:13,694
of a $20-million painting

688
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:19,500
and enraged the consigliere
who entrusted me with the task.

689
00:36:19,535 --> 00:36:23,504
Do you really think I'd do all
that just to play you, Harold?

690
00:36:39,122 --> 00:36:40,321
A bunch of numbers?

691
00:36:40,356 --> 00:36:42,623
Yes, until you substitute each number

692
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:45,259
for the corresponding letter
of the alphabet...

693
00:36:45,295 --> 00:36:48,629
1 becomes A, 2 becomes B, and so forth.

694
00:36:48,665 --> 00:36:50,317
Do you have a pen?

695
00:36:51,567 --> 00:36:52,974
Ah, good.

696
00:36:53,017 --> 00:36:54,354
Alright, let's hurry.

697
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:58,439
I'm morbidly curious
to find out what painful end

698
00:36:58,474 --> 00:37:00,910
Elizabeth has in store for me.

699
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:04,045
The code was the address
for some abandoned warehouse,

700
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,313
a date, and a time.

701
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:06,781
Instructions for a hit.

702
00:37:06,816 --> 00:37:08,316
But the device was spitting out
random numbers.

703
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:09,684
What... What were we missing?

704
00:37:09,719 --> 00:37:11,152
One more step.
Each number in the sequence

705
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:13,054
represents a corresponding
letter of the alphabet.

706
00:37:13,089 --> 00:37:14,855
So the billboard was a message.

707
00:37:14,891 --> 00:37:17,224
Which means Reddington
told us the truth,

708
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:18,359
and Keen didn't.

709
00:37:23,399 --> 00:37:25,099
I understand why you're upset.

710
00:37:25,134 --> 00:37:26,334
I wasn't honest with you.

711
00:37:26,686 --> 00:37:28,269
For what it's worth,
I wish I'd been wrong

712
00:37:28,304 --> 00:37:30,404
to doubt your judgment about Keen.

713
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,672
You were wrong.

714
00:37:31,708 --> 00:37:33,274
How can you say that?

715
00:37:33,309 --> 00:37:34,608
She said this was about keeping her

716
00:37:34,644 --> 00:37:37,111
from Mr. Reddington's intel
when we now know

717
00:37:37,146 --> 00:37:38,579
it was about keeping him
from reading hers.

718
00:37:38,614 --> 00:37:40,214
Look. I know that's what it looks like.

719
00:37:40,249 --> 00:37:42,216
It looks that way
because it is that way.

720
00:37:42,251 --> 00:37:43,784
You need to accept that.

721
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:47,421
Why? So you stop following me?

722
00:37:55,932 --> 00:37:58,432
Raymond!
- Hello, Paula!

723
00:37:58,468 --> 00:38:00,801
Thank you for coming. How was the drive?

724
00:38:00,837 --> 00:38:02,837
Did Dembe talk your ear off?

725
00:38:02,872 --> 00:38:04,972
It was just great.

726
00:38:05,008 --> 00:38:09,744
Sometimes I like to lean my head
on the window next to me

727
00:38:09,779 --> 00:38:13,447
so I can feel all of
the little bumps on the road,

728
00:38:13,483 --> 00:38:16,083
and my vision starts to flutter

729
00:38:16,119 --> 00:38:19,820
and I just space out,
like I'm in a dream.

730
00:38:19,856 --> 00:38:22,023
That sounds nice.

731
00:38:22,058 --> 00:38:24,458
You know what also sounds nice?

732
00:38:24,494 --> 00:38:26,427
Employment.

733
00:38:26,462 --> 00:38:27,928
Did you get a new job?

734
00:38:27,964 --> 00:38:29,330
I did not.

735
00:38:29,365 --> 00:38:30,598
I'm offering one.

736
00:38:30,633 --> 00:38:33,067
What kind of job?

737
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:34,769
A service provider.

738
00:38:34,804 --> 00:38:39,240
Are you asking me
to find people for you?

739
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:40,741
Like Jelly Bean did?

740
00:38:40,777 --> 00:38:44,211
Why don't we sit, have a cup of tea,

741
00:38:44,247 --> 00:38:47,214
share some tawdry tales,
have a laugh or two,

742
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:49,283
and then we'll drive you home.

743
00:38:49,318 --> 00:38:51,919
You can put your head
up against the glass

744
00:38:51,954 --> 00:38:53,888
and go to your happy place,

745
00:38:53,923 --> 00:38:57,491
and I can tell you what it is
I have in mind.

746
00:39:04,267 --> 00:39:05,966
Ressler.
- Hey.

747
00:39:06,002 --> 00:39:07,635
Thank God you're alright, Keen.

748
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:10,071
I don't even know why
I'm returning this call.

749
00:39:10,106 --> 00:39:12,339
Look. I'm sorry.
They used me to lure you out.

750
00:39:12,375 --> 00:39:14,308
Yeah, well, a lot of good that did.

751
00:39:14,343 --> 00:39:16,077
You're right. But at least now

752
00:39:16,112 --> 00:39:17,578
I know what those numbers mean.

753
00:39:17,613 --> 00:39:20,247
Because Cooper handed the device
over to Reddington.

754
00:39:20,283 --> 00:39:23,584
He did.
- So they decoded his fake message.

755
00:39:23,619 --> 00:39:24,819
They think I'm a liar.

756
00:39:24,854 --> 00:39:26,987
No, but I don't, and I'll prove it.

757
00:39:27,023 --> 00:39:28,956
I know the step that you're missing.

758
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:31,425
Look. Each number stands for a letter...

759
00:39:31,461 --> 00:39:32,927
1 is A, 2 is B, 3 is C.

760
00:39:32,962 --> 00:39:34,695
They're using alphanumeric substitution.

761
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:36,697
Exactly.
- Hang on.

762
00:39:36,732 --> 00:39:40,267
Okay. 17 is Q.

763
00:39:40,303 --> 00:39:42,403
16 is O. No.

764
00:39:42,438 --> 00:39:44,338
16 is P.

765
00:39:44,373 --> 00:39:47,308
18 is R. 1 is A.

766
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:48,876
14.
- N.

767
00:39:48,911 --> 00:39:50,010
16?
- P.

768
00:39:50,046 --> 00:39:51,664
2 is B.

769
00:39:52,482 --> 00:39:54,181
Wait a minute.
That doesn't make any sense.

770
00:39:54,217 --> 00:39:55,282
What does it say, Keen?

771
00:39:55,318 --> 00:39:57,750
QPRANPB. It's not a word.

772
00:39:57,786 --> 00:40:00,054
Maybe it's backwards or the
letters of each word are jumbled.

773
00:40:00,089 --> 00:40:02,223
I mean, Reddington told us
this is how it works.

774
00:40:02,258 --> 00:40:04,191
It has to say something.

775
00:40:06,262 --> 00:40:08,431
Oh, my God. That's it.

776
00:40:08,898 --> 00:40:10,965
The Cyrillic alphabet.

777
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
We translated the numbers into English

778
00:40:13,035 --> 00:40:14,535
because that's what Reddington did,

779
00:40:14,570 --> 00:40:17,649
but his message was a fake
meant to throw us off.

780
00:40:47,432 --> 00:40:50,149
_

781
00:40:53,714 --> 00:40:54,808
Oh, my God.

782
00:40:54,844 --> 00:40:56,477
Keen, what does it say?

783
00:40:56,512 --> 00:40:59,180
"It's time. Mobilize assets."

784
00:41:00,108 --> 00:41:03,184
A message from a Russian handler
to a Russian spy.

785
00:41:03,219 --> 00:41:04,518
Reddington.

786
00:41:04,554 --> 00:41:08,032
But what does he mean?
"It's time." Time for what?

787
00:41:15,398 --> 00:41:16,997
Rise and shine, sleepyhead!

788
00:41:17,033 --> 00:41:18,365
Elizabeth.

789
00:41:18,401 --> 00:41:20,668
You wanted proof? I got your proof.

790
00:41:20,703 --> 00:41:22,503
Proof that Reddington is N-13.

791
00:41:22,538 --> 00:41:24,171
Proof that he's responsible

792
00:41:24,207 --> 00:41:25,573
for what happened to your family.

793
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:28,075
And proof that my mother was innocent.

794
00:41:29,579 --> 00:41:31,512
I can walk you through the details

795
00:41:31,547 --> 00:41:33,047
after you catch your breath

796
00:41:33,082 --> 00:41:35,316
and after you get it
through your thick skull

797
00:41:35,351 --> 00:41:37,585
that you do not threaten me!

798
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:40,221
Because while we may be
partners in this hunt,

799
00:41:40,256 --> 00:41:42,389
I do not work for you!

800
00:41:42,539 --> 00:41:43,739
