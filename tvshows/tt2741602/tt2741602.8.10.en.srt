Let's Get Him Into The Van.

14
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,900
He Needs Oxygen.

00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:41,822
Where Is He?

24
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,100

We're Ready To Start The Uplink.

52
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:31,844
change Of Plans.
What Does That Mean?

53
00:03:31,868 --> 00:03:34,413
it Means I Need You Here In The U.s.

54
00:03:34,437 --> 00:03:35,781
it's, Uh...

55
00:03:35,805 --> 00:03:38,484
it's A Matter Of Some Urgency.

56
00:04:07,804 --> 00:04:10,755
you Can't Be Here. They'll See You.

57
00:04:12,242 --> 00:04:15,521
i Once Dropped Acid With Allen Ginsberg.

58
00:04:15,545 --> 00:04:19,013
we Spent A Glorious Afternoon In Soho...

59
00:04:19,816 --> 00:04:21,527
just Tumbling.

60
00:04:21,551 --> 00:04:24,811
i Know What You Want,
But I Can't Help You.

61
00:04:24,981 --> 00:04:27,181
i Miss That Gentleness.

62
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:36,509
you're A Service Provider, Bobby.

63
00:04:36,533 --> 00:04:39,429
i Put You On The Payroll
To Provide A Service...

64
00:04:39,453 --> 00:04:42,047
information On Townsend.

65
00:04:42,071 --> 00:04:44,784
you're Laundering His Money
Out Of A Laundromat,

66
00:04:44,808 --> 00:04:47,319
which Is In Itself Entertaining,

67
00:04:47,343 --> 00:04:49,655
but I Also Know
You're Skimming Off The Top.

68
00:04:49,679 --> 00:04:50,801
that's Not True.

69
00:04:50,825 --> 00:04:53,192
oh, You're Definitely Stealing
From Townsend.

70
00:04:53,216 --> 00:04:54,994
and While I Admire Your Chutzpah,

71
00:04:55,018 --> 00:04:56,862
i Can't Help But Think That If I Know

72
00:04:56,886 --> 00:04:58,845
you're Stealing From Townsend...

73
00:04:59,889 --> 00:05:02,014
it's Just A Matter Of Time.

74
00:05:02,859 --> 00:05:05,638
so...
Tell Me Where I Can Find Him

75
00:05:05,662 --> 00:05:08,307
or Where I Can Find Someone Who Can.

76
00:05:08,331 --> 00:05:10,648
i Don't Know Where He Is.

77
00:05:14,404 --> 00:05:16,612
but I Know Where His Money Goes.

78
00:05:16,906 --> 00:05:20,119
once It's Cleaned,
I Make A Series Of Deposits.

79
00:05:20,143 --> 00:05:21,784
who Gets The Biggest One?

80
00:05:22,692 --> 00:05:24,078
a Woman.

81
00:05:24,894 --> 00:05:26,434
laken Perillos.

82
00:05:26,472 --> 00:05:27,627
perillos.

83
00:05:27,652 --> 00:05:29,597
the Brazen Bull.

84
00:05:29,632 --> 00:05:31,435
what?
Go On.

85
00:05:31,488 --> 00:05:32,832
i Don't Know Who Perillos Is,

86
00:05:32,856 --> 00:05:35,634
but I Assume That
If You Could Get To Her,

87
00:05:35,658 --> 00:05:37,436
she Could Help You Find Townsend.

88
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:38,711
and Where Is She?

89
00:05:38,741 --> 00:05:40,094
in The States.

90
00:05:40,897 --> 00:05:43,342
i Was Told That She Came In Last Night.

91
00:05:43,366 --> 00:05:45,244
that's All That I Know.

92
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:48,914
that Was Ruddiger.

93
00:05:48,938 --> 00:05:50,749
he Thinks He Has Something For Us.

94
00:05:50,773 --> 00:05:52,685
you Know What They Call A Money Launderer

95
00:05:52,709 --> 00:05:54,854
who Can't Be Trusted?

96
00:05:54,878 --> 00:05:56,444
a Bad Investment.

97
00:05:56,846 --> 00:05:58,404
get Out Of Here.

98
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:02,528
i Have A Lead.

99
00:06:02,552 --> 00:06:03,762
townsend.

100
00:06:03,786 --> 00:06:06,354
an Arrest Warrant
Has Been Issued For Elizabeth.

101
00:06:06,662 --> 00:06:07,967
that's A Mistake.

102
00:06:07,991 --> 00:06:09,835
no. It's A Tragedy.

103
00:06:09,859 --> 00:06:11,804
i Can Tell You How To Get To Townsend.

104
00:06:11,828 --> 00:06:14,273
the Only Person I'm Focused
On Getting To Is Elizabeth.

105
00:06:14,297 --> 00:06:16,308
i Don't See How That's Helped
By Going After The Person

106
00:06:16,332 --> 00:06:17,457
whose Sister She Killed.

107
00:06:17,487 --> 00:06:20,679
elizabeth Killed Mary Bremmer
At Townsend's Instruction.

108
00:06:20,703 --> 00:06:22,081
townsend Wanted His Sister Killed?

109
00:06:22,105 --> 00:06:23,983
no, But You Had Her In Custody,

110
00:06:24,007 --> 00:06:26,719
so He Ordered The Hit
To Keep Her From Talking.

111
00:06:26,743 --> 00:06:29,021
and As A Test Of Elizabeth's Allegiance.

112
00:06:29,045 --> 00:06:31,357
keen And Townsend Are Allies?

113
00:06:31,381 --> 00:06:32,691
i Thought She Wanted Him Dead.

114
00:06:32,715 --> 00:06:34,527
a Desire She's Put On Hold

115
00:06:34,551 --> 00:06:37,485
so They Can Join Forces And Come After Me.

116
00:06:38,121 --> 00:06:40,232
so If I Follow Your Lead
And Go After Townsend,

117
00:06:40,256 --> 00:06:41,864
i Could Get To Elizabeth?

118
00:06:43,226 --> 00:06:47,439
tell Me, Harold, What Do You
Know About The Brazen Bull?

119
00:06:47,463 --> 00:06:50,009
aram: A Metal Bull? Used To
Torture And Execute People.

120
00:06:50,033 --> 00:06:51,677
cooper: According To Legend, Yes.

121
00:06:51,701 --> 00:06:53,245
the Condemned Were Locked Inside

122
00:06:53,269 --> 00:06:54,980
while A Fire Was Set Beneath It.

123
00:06:55,004 --> 00:06:56,195
that Is Brazen,

124
00:06:56,219 --> 00:06:57,950
but How's A Greek Torture Device
Relevant To Us?

125
00:06:57,974 --> 00:07:00,619
the Bull Was Invented By Perillos Of Athens,

126
00:07:00,643 --> 00:07:01,620
a Student Of Pain

127
00:07:01,644 --> 00:07:04,189
and The Eponymous Namesake Of Laken Perillos,

128
00:07:04,213 --> 00:07:06,425
the Woman Neville Townsend
Employs To Inflict Pain

129
00:07:06,449 --> 00:07:08,594
on His Victims To Extract Information.

130
00:07:08,618 --> 00:07:10,996
reddington Believes Perillos
Can Lead Us To Townsend

131
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:12,765
and Townsend Can Lead Us To Keen.

132
00:07:12,789 --> 00:07:14,333
not After She Killed His Sister.

133
00:07:14,357 --> 00:07:16,769
apparently That's What Townsend
Wanted Her To Do...

134
00:07:16,793 --> 00:07:18,170
as A Test Of Her Loyalty.

135
00:07:18,194 --> 00:07:20,962
mr. Reddington Says
Liz Is Working With Townsend?

136
00:07:22,564 --> 00:07:23,797
this Is Impossible.

137
00:07:23,822 --> 00:07:25,321
i Hope You're Right.

138
00:07:25,401 --> 00:07:27,212
but There's Only One Way To Find Out.

139
00:07:27,236 --> 00:07:28,548
what Do We Know About Perillos?

140
00:07:28,572 --> 00:07:29,628
very Little.

141
00:07:29,652 --> 00:07:31,750
except That She's Brutal And Effective.

142
00:07:31,774 --> 00:07:34,053
she Came Onto The Scene Six Years Ago.

143
00:07:34,077 --> 00:07:36,956
at That Time, Antonio Bastinado,
Dominic Morgan,

144
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:39,458
and Andres Gataki Controlled
The Ships That Carried

145
00:07:39,482 --> 00:07:41,994
nearly All The Contraband
Coming Through The Bosphorus.

146
00:07:42,018 --> 00:07:44,363
how They Managed It
Was A Tightly Guarded Secret

147
00:07:44,387 --> 00:07:45,945
until Perillos Got Hold Of Them.

148
00:07:45,969 --> 00:07:47,266
now They're Dead.

149
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:48,644
townsend Controls The Strait...

150
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:52,004
and Examples Of Perillos'
Handiwork Keep People In Line.

151
00:07:52,028 --> 00:07:53,839
liz Doesn't Know
Townsend Sanctioned This.

152
00:07:53,863 --> 00:07:55,708
i Mean, She Can't Know, Right?

153
00:07:55,732 --> 00:07:57,476
did Reddington Give You
A Lead On Perillos?

154
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,745
he Gave Me The One Victim
Perillos Didn't Kill.

155
00:07:59,769 --> 00:08:02,781
name's Roman Einhorn.
Has An Estate In Westchester.

156
00:08:02,805 --> 00:08:05,551
reddington Says Perillos Left Him Alive

157
00:08:05,575 --> 00:08:07,119
as A Warning To Others.

158
00:08:07,143 --> 00:08:08,294
what Kind Of Warning?

159
00:08:08,318 --> 00:08:10,255
apparently You'll See
When You Talk To Him.

160
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:12,313
or... Try To.

161
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:17,963
caregiver: I Told You,
This Is A Waste Of Your Time.

162
00:08:17,987 --> 00:08:19,098
he Doesn't Want To See You.

163
00:08:19,122 --> 00:08:20,499
well, He Doesn't Have A Choice.

164
00:08:20,523 --> 00:08:23,102
mr. Einhorn Hasn't Accepted
Guests In Almost Two Years.

165
00:08:23,126 --> 00:08:25,104
ma'am, We're Not His Guests.
We're The Fbi.

166
00:08:25,128 --> 00:08:26,802
he Has No Choice.

167
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:29,808
what Exactly Did They Tell You
About Mr. Einhorn?

168
00:08:29,832 --> 00:08:31,510
we Know He Was Maimed.

169
00:08:31,534 --> 00:08:33,979
look, We're Just Trying To Find
The Woman Who Was Responsible.

170
00:08:36,072 --> 00:08:38,372
the Gaze Interaction
Can Be Slow To Respond.

171
00:08:38,689 --> 00:08:40,232
he Gets Frustrated.

172
00:08:40,563 --> 00:08:42,296
you Need To Be Patient.

173
00:08:45,081 --> 00:08:47,448
I Remember Nothing.

174
00:08:48,151 --> 00:08:50,896
Mr. Einhorn, We Understand Your Apprehension.

175
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,464
park: We're Trying To Help.

176
00:08:52,488 --> 00:08:55,234
and As He Told You, Mr. Einhorn
Doesn't Want Your Help.

177
00:08:55,258 --> 00:08:58,437
mr. Einhorn, Dr. Perillos
Isn't Just Mutilating People,

178
00:08:58,461 --> 00:08:59,805
she's Murdering Them.

179
00:08:59,829 --> 00:09:01,407
we Understand That You're The Only Person

180
00:09:01,431 --> 00:09:02,941
who Survived Her Torture,

181
00:09:02,965 --> 00:09:04,882
the Only One Who's Seen Her Face,

182
00:09:05,307 --> 00:09:07,107
and We Need Your Help To Stop Her.

183
00:09:07,203 --> 00:09:11,717
what Happened To Me
Six Years Ago Was A Warning,

184
00:09:11,741 --> 00:09:15,954
an Illustration To Others
Who Question Her Limits.

185
00:09:15,978 --> 00:09:19,058
i Was Told That If I Assist The Police,

186
00:09:19,082 --> 00:09:23,662
the Doctor Would Come Back
To Finish What She Started.

187
00:09:23,686 --> 00:09:26,398
this Was Her Promise To Me,

188
00:09:26,422 --> 00:09:31,837
and So, As I Said To You
Before, I Know Nothing.

189
00:09:41,337 --> 00:09:44,116
ruddiger.

190
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:45,350
how Are You, My Friend?

191
00:09:45,374 --> 00:09:47,842
raymond, Good To See You. Dembe.

192
00:09:48,207 --> 00:09:49,188
smells.

193
00:09:49,212 --> 00:09:51,056
what The Hell Happened To Your Hand?

194
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,692
oh, Uh, Car Door. I Was Cooked.

195
00:09:53,716 --> 00:09:54,860
nearly Lost My Pinkie.

196
00:09:54,884 --> 00:09:56,228
you Gotta Be Careful, Max.

197
00:09:56,252 --> 00:09:58,664
i Need You With All 10 Digits.

198
00:09:58,688 --> 00:10:00,054
that Does Smell.

199
00:10:00,079 --> 00:10:02,000
yeah.
What Did You Find?

200
00:10:02,024 --> 00:10:05,904
the Car Bomb That Killed Your
Man In Lagos Was Breathtaking.

201
00:10:05,928 --> 00:10:09,541
large Detonation Wave,
Secondary Explosion.

202
00:10:09,565 --> 00:10:11,009
our Friends Over At A Command

203
00:10:11,033 --> 00:10:13,178
said They Found
Ammonium Nitrate Crystals

204
00:10:13,202 --> 00:10:14,394
in The Post-blast Remains.

205
00:10:14,418 --> 00:10:15,948
that Sounds Bloody Awful.

206
00:10:15,972 --> 00:10:18,417
yeah.
What's The Lead?

207
00:10:18,441 --> 00:10:21,751
a... Partial Print
On The Tamiya Connector.

208
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:24,253
i'll Get It To Cvetko.

209
00:10:25,194 --> 00:10:27,427
who Could Do This, Raymond?

210
00:10:27,452 --> 00:10:29,419
not Elizabeth, I'm Sure.

211
00:10:29,444 --> 00:10:31,010
not On Her Own, No.

212
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,199
i'm Afraid Elizabeth
Has Enlisted Neville Townsend

213
00:10:34,223 --> 00:10:36,969
to Weaponize The Various Details

214
00:10:36,993 --> 00:10:39,994
she's Come To Learn
About My Organization.

215
00:10:41,063 --> 00:10:43,509
cvetko, It's Dembe.

216
00:10:43,533 --> 00:10:45,310
what The Hell Is That Smell, Anyway?

217
00:10:45,334 --> 00:10:46,779
it's Dreadful.

218
00:10:46,803 --> 00:10:50,983
oh, I'm Working On
A Cyclohexane-based Accelerant.

219
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,885
low Flash Point. Stable.

220
00:10:52,909 --> 00:10:56,700
and A Real Pain In The Butt To
Any Forensic Chemical Analysts.

221
00:10:56,725 --> 00:10:58,444
thank You, Cvetko.

222
00:10:58,468 --> 00:11:00,206
we'll Have It To You Today.

223
00:11:08,831 --> 00:11:10,235
raymond.

224
00:11:10,259 --> 00:11:12,259
raymond, I Think You Should Go.

225
00:11:18,501 --> 00:11:19,745
raymond, Go!

226
00:11:19,769 --> 00:11:21,246
get Him Out Of Here!

227
00:11:26,475 --> 00:11:27,352
ow!

228
00:11:27,376 --> 00:11:28,809
go, Go, Go!

229
00:11:34,629 --> 00:11:36,061
where Is He?!

230
00:11:39,255 --> 00:11:41,333
where He Is?! Reddington?!

231
00:11:41,357 --> 00:11:42,835
i Don't Know.

232
00:11:42,859 --> 00:11:45,270
Search The Building.
We Know He's Here.

233
00:11:45,294 --> 00:11:46,705
get Him In The Van!

234
00:11:48,631 --> 00:11:51,476
warehouse Is Clear! No Sign!

235
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,111
forget It. Let's Go!

236
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:56,615
put Him In, Put Him In.

237
00:11:59,775 --> 00:12:01,275
get In.

238
00:12:06,664 --> 00:12:09,077
We're Here Now Securing The Scene, But Back Up.

239
00:12:09,101 --> 00:12:10,411
tell Me Exactly What Happened.

240
00:12:10,435 --> 00:12:12,361
red: It Was An Ambush. Heavily Armed.

241
00:12:12,385 --> 00:12:14,209
what About A Vehicle?
It Was A Van.

242
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,560
white Ford. Four Or Five Men.

243
00:12:16,584 --> 00:12:18,460
faces? Accents?
I Don't Know.

244
00:12:18,484 --> 00:12:20,662
they Were Masked,
And I Didn't Hear Them Speak.

245
00:12:20,686 --> 00:12:22,131
but Come On, It Was Her, Donald.

246
00:12:22,155 --> 00:12:24,199
we Don't Know That.
You Got A Lot Of Enemies.

247
00:12:24,223 --> 00:12:26,135
besides, Keen Wouldn't Target Dembe.

248
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:29,638
i've Lost Any Perspective Of
What Agent Keen Is Capable Of.

249
00:12:29,662 --> 00:12:32,007
i Only Know That We Need
To Get Dembe Back,

250
00:12:32,031 --> 00:12:34,443
because If He Is
In The Hands Of Perillos,

251
00:12:34,467 --> 00:12:36,845
it Won't Matter What Agent Keen Wants...

252
00:12:36,869 --> 00:12:39,448
only How Long He Can Survive.

253
00:12:39,472 --> 00:12:40,499
we'll Find Him.

254
00:12:40,523 --> 00:12:42,951
call Me Back As Soon As You Know More.

255
00:12:42,975 --> 00:12:44,542
Ressler.

256
00:12:48,614 --> 00:12:52,161
headlight Trim From The Van.
It's A Start.

257
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:02,928
mm.
Look At You.

258
00:13:03,729 --> 00:13:06,141
so You're The One They Call...

259
00:13:06,165 --> 00:13:07,876
dembe.

260
00:13:16,275 --> 00:13:18,854
quite A Collection, Isn't It?

261
00:13:18,878 --> 00:13:21,972
each One Teaches Me
Something About Pain.

262
00:13:22,388 --> 00:13:24,388
how To Alleviate It...

263
00:13:28,113 --> 00:13:29,813
...or Inflict It.

264
00:13:37,201 --> 00:13:40,102
when I Was 12, My Mother
Went To The Hospital

265
00:13:40,127 --> 00:13:43,228
with A Neural Infection
That Was Misdiagnosed

266
00:13:43,253 --> 00:13:45,253
as A Strained Muscle.

267
00:13:45,304 --> 00:13:46,834
she Was Given Ibuprofen

268
00:13:46,858 --> 00:13:48,183
and Sent Home...

269
00:13:48,207 --> 00:13:53,956
...with An Infection That
Left Her In Excruciating Pain

270
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:56,058
and Bedridden For The Rest Of Her Life.

271
00:13:57,065 --> 00:13:59,426
what Caused The Misdiagnosis?

272
00:14:01,454 --> 00:14:03,097
the Color Of Her Skin.

273
00:14:03,723 --> 00:14:07,309
the Belief... Even By Some Doctors...

274
00:14:07,627 --> 00:14:10,354
that Blacks Feel Less Pain Than Whites.

275
00:14:10,763 --> 00:14:13,148
thick Skin, Biology, Breeding...

276
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:15,143
lies That Lead To Black Patients

277
00:14:15,167 --> 00:14:18,362
receiving Far Fewer Pain Meds
Than White Patients.

278
00:14:18,838 --> 00:14:21,739
but We Know The Truth, Don't We, Dembe?

279
00:14:22,074 --> 00:14:25,320
we Know All About Pain, Don't We?

280
00:14:27,747 --> 00:14:29,246
it's Called The Heretic's Fork.

281
00:14:29,956 --> 00:14:32,160
It Was Used During The Spanish Inquisition

282
00:14:32,184 --> 00:14:34,096
to Extract Confessions.

283
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,380
break The Human Sprit.

284
00:14:37,189 --> 00:14:42,845
tell The Truth, Or Sooner Or
Later, You'll Bleed To Death.

285
00:14:43,129 --> 00:14:47,542
it's Inscribed With
The Latin Word "abiuro,"

286
00:14:47,566 --> 00:14:50,519
which Means To Swear Or Take An Oath.

287
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:53,916
will You Do That For Me, Dembe?

288
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:57,552
swear To Tell Me Everything You
Know About The Sikorsky Archive?

289
00:14:57,576 --> 00:14:59,278
walahi.

290
00:15:00,479 --> 00:15:03,158
i Swear I Won't Tell You Anything.

291
00:15:09,121 --> 00:15:11,500
oh, I Think You Will.

292
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,244
tell Me You Found Something.

293
00:15:22,268 --> 00:15:25,013
We Think We Found The Van Used In The Abduction.

294
00:15:25,037 --> 00:15:26,715
it's Missing A Piece Of The Headlight Trim

295
00:15:26,739 --> 00:15:27,716
we Found At The Scene.

296
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:28,984
and What About Dembe?

297
00:15:29,008 --> 00:15:30,485
does The Van Tell You Anything

298
00:15:30,509 --> 00:15:31,704
about Where They May Have Taken Dembe?

299
00:15:31,728 --> 00:15:33,889
no, We're Waiting On The Lab,
But They Think It's Unlikely.

300
00:15:33,913 --> 00:15:36,792
the Vehicle Was Torched.
Mpd's Doing A Search Now.

301
00:15:36,816 --> 00:15:38,660
lab Services Should Have A Report

302
00:15:38,684 --> 00:15:39,895
within 24 Hours, Maybe Less.

303
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:41,563
we Don't Have That Kind Of Time.

304
00:15:41,587 --> 00:15:43,632
look, I'm Telling You What We Know.

305
00:15:43,656 --> 00:15:45,367
yeah. Thank You, Donald.

306
00:16:07,813 --> 00:16:09,458
look, Please...

307
00:16:11,884 --> 00:16:13,729
no!

308
00:16:13,753 --> 00:16:15,430
you Betrayed Us.

309
00:16:15,454 --> 00:16:17,699
you Heard Dembe Talking About Ruddiger.

310
00:16:17,723 --> 00:16:19,868
no.
And You Knew Where We Were Gonna Be.

311
00:16:19,892 --> 00:16:21,903
no.
You Set Us Up.

312
00:16:27,099 --> 00:16:29,867
i Think You Better Answer That.

313
00:16:33,873 --> 00:16:36,451
Operator 627, Ward West.

314
00:16:36,475 --> 00:16:39,154
ward West. Briargate Confirm.

315
00:16:39,178 --> 00:16:40,655

316
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:41,857
do You Have A Breach?

317
00:16:41,881 --> 00:16:44,626
yes, There's Been A Breach... By Me.

318
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:46,461

319
00:16:46,485 --> 00:16:48,430
i'm Gonna Give You A Phone Number.

320
00:16:48,454 --> 00:16:51,733
you're Gonna Pass It Up
The Food Chain To Your Boss.

321
00:16:51,757 --> 00:16:54,236
tell Neville Townsend It's Raymond Reddington.

322
00:16:54,260 --> 00:17:01,209
tell Him To Call Me In
20 Minutes At 202-555-0184.

323
00:17:01,233 --> 00:17:03,812
it's A Conversation He Won't Want To Miss.

324
00:17:03,836 --> 00:17:05,047
Aah!

325
00:17:07,907 --> 00:17:10,318
i'll Get You A Cane To Remember Me By.

326
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:15,456
my Apologies, Ladies.

327
00:17:22,754 --> 00:17:24,266
Hello, Mr. Zuma.

328
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:26,034
i-i'm Sorry We Have To Meet Like This,

329
00:17:26,058 --> 00:17:28,670
but I've Found This Process
To Be Both Efficient

330
00:17:28,694 --> 00:17:30,839
and Effective For All Involved.

331
00:17:30,863 --> 00:17:33,108
i'm Going To Ask You Some Questions.

332
00:17:33,132 --> 00:17:34,543
you're Going To Answer.

333
00:17:34,567 --> 00:17:37,246
if You Waver, Dr. Perillos Will Help

334
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:39,114
encourage Your Cooperation.

335
00:17:39,138 --> 00:17:42,484
let's Begin With The Sikorsky Archive.

336
00:17:42,508 --> 00:17:44,542
does Reddington Have It?

337
00:17:47,321 --> 00:17:51,260
uh, M-mr. Zuma, I Need An Answer.

338
00:17:51,284 --> 00:17:53,744
no? Nothing?

339
00:17:56,955 --> 00:18:00,624
the Irukandji Jellyfish Is Found
Off The Coast Of Australia.

340
00:18:00,959 --> 00:18:03,972
its Sting Is Only Mildly Irritating,

341
00:18:03,996 --> 00:18:05,340
but Within Half An Hour,

342
00:18:05,364 --> 00:18:08,610
its Venom Induces
Excruciating Muscle Cramps,

343
00:18:08,634 --> 00:18:10,312
severe Back Pain,

344
00:18:10,336 --> 00:18:13,749
and A Burning Sensation
In The Skin And Face.

345
00:18:13,773 --> 00:18:15,009
headaches.

346
00:18:15,033 --> 00:18:16,552
sweating.

347
00:18:16,576 --> 00:18:17,820
nausea.

348
00:18:17,844 --> 00:18:19,988
it's Called Irukandji Syndrome.

349
00:18:20,012 --> 00:18:23,425
the Pain, Combined With
An Increase In Heart Rate

350
00:18:23,449 --> 00:18:28,070
and Blood Pressure, Causes
A Feeling Of Impending Doom.

351
00:18:28,654 --> 00:18:30,332
chances Are...

352
00:18:30,356 --> 00:18:34,102
you Just May Want To Impale
Yourself To Ease The Pain.

353
00:18:34,126 --> 00:18:37,639
uh, Mr. Zuma, Shall We Discuss
The Sikorsky Archive,

354
00:18:37,663 --> 00:18:39,763
or Do...
Do You Need Some Encouragement?

355
00:18:42,735 --> 00:18:45,147
bad Choice, Mr. Zuma.

356
00:18:45,171 --> 00:18:47,382
don't Say I Didn't Warn You.

357
00:18:47,406 --> 00:18:49,918
doctor,
I'll Give The Two Of You Some Time Together.

358
00:18:51,635 --> 00:18:52,855
what Is It?
It's Reddington.

359
00:18:52,879 --> 00:18:54,156
he's Made Contact.

360
00:19:05,525 --> 00:19:08,003
dembe Zuma. I Want Him Back.

361
00:19:08,027 --> 00:19:09,338
i'm Sure You Do.

362
00:19:09,362 --> 00:19:11,540
keen Tells Me He Knows All Your Secrets.

363
00:19:11,564 --> 00:19:13,675
elizabeth Would Never Hurt Dembe.

364
00:19:13,699 --> 00:19:14,977
i Want The Archive.

365
00:19:15,001 --> 00:19:16,445
at What Cost?

366
00:19:16,469 --> 00:19:17,813
a War With Me?

367
00:19:17,837 --> 00:19:19,648
have You Thought About What That Means?

368
00:19:19,672 --> 00:19:21,216
all I've Thought About Recently

369
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:24,052
is The Fact That You Killed My Family.

370
00:19:24,076 --> 00:19:26,355
i Don't Know What Elizabeth
Is Telling You,

371
00:19:26,379 --> 00:19:31,093
but Katarina Rostova Killed
Your Family, And I Killed Her.

372
00:19:31,117 --> 00:19:35,097
that Alone Should Be Enough
For Us To Peacefully Co-exist.

373
00:19:35,121 --> 00:19:38,567
a Fact We Can Discuss In Person
Once You Accept My Offer.

374
00:19:38,591 --> 00:19:41,003
w-what Kind Of Offer?

375
00:19:41,027 --> 00:19:42,404
for Dembe.

376
00:19:42,428 --> 00:19:43,805
me For Him.

377
00:19:43,829 --> 00:19:45,007
a Trade.

378
00:19:45,031 --> 00:19:46,241
yes.

379
00:19:46,265 --> 00:19:47,509
and Then An Uprising.

380
00:19:47,533 --> 00:19:49,545
Your People.

381
00:19:49,569 --> 00:19:51,146
rallying Around Your Sacrifice.

382
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:53,749
i-i Had No Idea
You Were Such A Romantic.

383
00:19:53,773 --> 00:19:55,984
Oh, My Goodness, Yes.

384
00:19:56,008 --> 00:20:00,662
i Have Many "thoughts That Do
Often Lie Too Deep For Tears."

385
00:20:01,047 --> 00:20:03,158
at The Moment, The Main One Being

386
00:20:03,182 --> 00:20:05,834
to Put A Bullet In Your Forehead.

387
00:20:06,452 --> 00:20:08,297
do We Have A Deal?
We Do.

388
00:20:08,321 --> 00:20:10,198
i'll Call You Back
With The Where And When.

389
00:20:23,169 --> 00:20:24,980
I Wasn't Making It Up.

390
00:20:25,004 --> 00:20:26,648
about The Doctors.

391
00:20:26,672 --> 00:20:33,221
in 2016, 222 White Doctors
At The University Of Virginia

392
00:20:33,245 --> 00:20:35,290
were Given Mock Medical Files

393
00:20:35,314 --> 00:20:38,393
of A White Patient And A Black Patient

394
00:20:38,417 --> 00:20:42,931
and Asked To Gauge Their Pain
On A Scale Of 1 To 10.

395
00:20:42,955 --> 00:20:46,333
they Underestimated The
Black Patient's Pain Because...

396
00:20:46,759 --> 00:20:50,505
now, These Are Doctors...
They Said They Thought

397
00:20:50,529 --> 00:20:54,174
black People Had Less
Sensitive Nerve Endings.

398
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:58,847
why Is It That White People
Don't See Our Pain?

399
00:20:58,871 --> 00:21:01,640
i Know Townsend Doesn't See Mine.

400
00:21:02,108 --> 00:21:03,975
what About Reddington?

401
00:21:04,443 --> 00:21:05,743
does He See Yours?

402
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:09,191
i Know Who You Are To Him.

403
00:21:09,215 --> 00:21:11,482
what You Do For Him.

404
00:21:12,192 --> 00:21:14,129
the Secrets You Keep,
Like You're Doing Now,

405
00:21:14,153 --> 00:21:16,298
not Telling Me About The Archive.

406
00:21:16,322 --> 00:21:20,168
does He Know What Pain That Causes You?

407
00:21:20,192 --> 00:21:23,572
i Don't Mean This Pain.
Anyone Can See That.

408
00:21:23,596 --> 00:21:24,773
i Mean Inside.

409
00:21:25,965 --> 00:21:28,083
the Pain In Your Heart.

410
00:21:28,801 --> 00:21:30,545
can He See That?

411
00:21:33,639 --> 00:21:34,616
you Can Stop.

412
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,851
excuse Me?

413
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:38,086
we're Making A Trade.
For Whom?

414
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:40,355
who Could Know The Archive More Than Zuma?

415
00:21:40,379 --> 00:21:41,745
raymond.

416
00:21:46,819 --> 00:21:49,564
he's Not Doing This To Save You.

417
00:21:49,588 --> 00:21:52,189
he's Doing It To Save Himself.

418
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:54,958
he.... He...

419
00:21:58,164 --> 00:22:00,798
he Does Feel My Pain.

420
00:22:01,675 --> 00:22:03,345
does He Now?

421
00:22:03,369 --> 00:22:04,813
good.

422
00:22:04,837 --> 00:22:06,415
then Maybe He'll Feel This.

423
00:22:21,187 --> 00:22:23,265
help You?
I'm Here For A Room.

424
00:22:23,289 --> 00:22:25,567
neville Said He'd Leave A Key.

425
00:22:25,591 --> 00:22:27,135
oh, Neville Said?

426
00:22:27,159 --> 00:22:28,103
neville Said.

427
00:22:28,127 --> 00:22:29,622
ah.

428
00:22:29,646 --> 00:22:31,521
come Around. I'll Buzz You In.

429
00:22:34,033 --> 00:22:35,711
what About The Dog?

430
00:22:35,735 --> 00:22:37,434
there's No Dog.

431
00:22:46,453 --> 00:22:47,689
is This Kosher?

432
00:22:52,151 --> 00:22:53,317
l'chaim.

433
00:22:55,306 --> 00:22:56,939
ahh.

434
00:22:59,058 --> 00:23:00,302
okay.

435
00:23:00,326 --> 00:23:01,937

i'm Supposed To Let You Go.

439
00:23:29,421 --> 00:23:32,834
but Your Resistance Is An Inspiration.

440
00:23:32,858 --> 00:23:38,073
it Makes Me Wonder... Are You
Really That Beholden To Him?

441
00:23:38,097 --> 00:23:41,109
would You Hold Out Until It's Too Late?

442
00:23:41,133 --> 00:23:42,633
i Guess We'll Never Know.

443
00:23:59,151 --> 00:24:01,997
get Back In That Chair!
I Won't Ask Again!

444
00:24:02,021 --> 00:24:03,153

447
00:24:33,319 --> 00:24:35,964
i'm Coming. Don't Give Yourself Up.

448
00:25:11,681 --> 00:25:13,481
Tell Me You Got There In Time.

449
00:25:14,094 --> 00:25:15,260
tell Me You Found Him.

450
00:25:15,285 --> 00:25:16,763
No, We Were Too Late.

451
00:25:16,787 --> 00:25:18,865
what Did You Find?
We're Securing The Scene Now,

452
00:25:18,889 --> 00:25:21,367
but It Looks Like Her People Broke
Everything Down And Cleared Out.

453
00:25:21,391 --> 00:25:23,002
there's No Sign Of Reddington.

454
00:25:23,026 --> 00:25:25,204
look, This Doctor, Is There
Anything That You Can Tell Me?

455
00:25:25,228 --> 00:25:27,340
any Specifics?
Any Details That Might Help?

456
00:25:27,364 --> 00:25:28,975
she Had Tools For Torture,

457
00:25:28,999 --> 00:25:33,679
and She Injected Me With A Vial
Of Poison From Jellyfish.

458
00:25:33,703 --> 00:25:34,914
jellyfish?

459
00:25:34,938 --> 00:25:36,527
irukandji Jellyfish.

460
00:25:36,553 --> 00:25:38,145
that's What She Called Them.

461
00:25:38,169 --> 00:25:39,813
i Reached Out To Some Associates Of Ours

462
00:25:39,837 --> 00:25:41,315
to Find Out Who Traffics Them.

463
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:42,716
Alright, Well...

464
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,385
look, My Forensics Team's Here.

465
00:25:44,409 --> 00:25:47,521
you Call Me As Soon As You Hear
Anything And I'll Do The Same.

466
00:26:08,666 --> 00:26:10,615
I'm Impressed.

467
00:26:11,235 --> 00:26:12,780
you Kept Your End Of The Deal,

468
00:26:12,804 --> 00:26:16,250
and In A Roundabout Way, So Did I.

469
00:26:16,274 --> 00:26:17,785
dembe Escaped.

470
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:20,621
yes. As Promised, He's Free.

471
00:26:20,645 --> 00:26:23,290
and With Him Went Your Leverage
To Get Me To Talk.

472
00:26:23,314 --> 00:26:26,582
oh, I Don't Know About That.

473
00:26:27,952 --> 00:26:30,176
the Brazen Bull, I Presume.

474
00:26:31,122 --> 00:26:34,214
excellent.
You're Familiar With Dr. Perillos.

475
00:26:34,239 --> 00:26:35,271
certainly.

476
00:26:35,296 --> 00:26:38,531
legendarily Draconian Methods.

477
00:26:38,663 --> 00:26:40,975
undeniably Effective Results.

478
00:26:40,999 --> 00:26:44,232
this Is Almost
A Bucket-list Moment For Me.

479
00:26:45,009 --> 00:26:47,145
shall We Begin?
Oh, Let's Not.

480
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:50,417
are You Familiar With
Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis?

481
00:26:50,441 --> 00:26:53,809
if I Say Yes, Can We Skip
The Demonstration?

482
00:26:54,242 --> 00:26:56,623
it's A Viral Infection Carried By Mice

483
00:26:56,647 --> 00:26:58,414
that Causes Ascending Paralysis.

484
00:26:58,705 --> 00:27:00,828
the Virus Attacks
The Peripheral Nervous System,

485
00:27:00,852 --> 00:27:02,930
then Works Its Way Upwards
Through The Legs

486
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:04,631
and Torso To The Chest,

487
00:27:04,655 --> 00:27:06,838
where It Paralyzes The Lungs...

488
00:27:08,158 --> 00:27:10,158
causing The Victim To Suffocate.

489
00:27:10,183 --> 00:27:12,343
careful. I'm Terribly Ticklish.

490
00:27:13,197 --> 00:27:15,509
See?

491
00:27:15,533 --> 00:27:17,711
there Is An Antidote,
Which I Will Supply

492
00:27:17,735 --> 00:27:19,980
after You've Told Me About The Archive.

493
00:27:20,004 --> 00:27:22,883
uh.... Think About It.

494
00:27:22,907 --> 00:27:24,518
but Not Too Long.

495
00:27:24,542 --> 00:27:27,009
you Haven't Got Much Time Left.

496
00:27:30,581 --> 00:27:31,859
what Did You Find Out?

497
00:27:31,883 --> 00:27:33,594
i Haven't Heard Back From Our People Yet.

498
00:27:33,618 --> 00:27:35,362
well, It Turns Out Irukandji Jellyfish

499
00:27:35,386 --> 00:27:38,165
are Sourced Only By A Few Select Brokers.

500
00:27:38,189 --> 00:27:40,467
brokers?
Who Sell Animals To Research Labs,

501
00:27:40,491 --> 00:27:42,202
universities, Veterinary Schools,

502
00:27:42,226 --> 00:27:44,304
and Companies To Provide
Animal Testing Services.

503
00:27:44,328 --> 00:27:46,407
disgusting, I Know, And It Gets Worse.

504
00:27:46,431 --> 00:27:48,375
there Are Two Types Of These "dealers."

505
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:50,244
class A, Which Breed Specifically

506
00:27:50,268 --> 00:27:52,212
for Research Purposes, And Class B,

507
00:27:52,236 --> 00:27:55,616
who Source Animals From Random
Locations Like Auctions, Pounds,

508
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,151
or Even Newspaper Ads.

509
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:58,649
okay, That Is Disgusting. Right?

510
00:27:58,682 --> 00:28:00,287
i Feel Like There's A Separate
Blacklist Case

511
00:28:00,311 --> 00:28:02,022
in Here Somewhere.
The Point Being?

512
00:28:02,046 --> 00:28:04,458
the Point Being I Could Only
Find Three Class B Vendors

513
00:28:04,482 --> 00:28:06,794
who Even Supply Our Species Of Jellyfish.

514
00:28:06,818 --> 00:28:09,430
two Haven't Made A Sale
In Well Over Six Months.

515
00:28:09,454 --> 00:28:10,531
And The Third?

516
00:28:10,555 --> 00:28:12,733
the Third Is Tolofson-hammond.

517
00:28:12,757 --> 00:28:14,835
london Based. License Revoked.

518
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:16,236
they Have A Court Case Pending,

519
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:19,160
and One Of Their Clients
Who Failed To Appear...

520
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:21,742
that's Her.

521
00:28:21,766 --> 00:28:22,910
Name's Kayla Lynne Banks.

522
00:28:22,934 --> 00:28:24,578
last Known Address In Cardiff.

523
00:28:24,602 --> 00:28:25,979
both Of Which Are Fakes.

524
00:28:26,003 --> 00:28:29,083
okay, Let's Work Backwards.
Unwind Her Alias.

525
00:28:29,107 --> 00:28:32,319
find Out Where She Got Her
Passports, Her Bank Accounts.

526
00:28:32,343 --> 00:28:33,921
how She Built This False Identity

527
00:28:33,945 --> 00:28:36,056
may Point Us To Where She Is Now.

528
00:28:42,174 --> 00:28:43,434
nothing?

529
00:28:44,444 --> 00:28:45,921
no Pain At All.

530
00:28:46,396 --> 00:28:47,490
good.

531
00:28:47,772 --> 00:28:50,305
and Here I Thought You Fetishized Pain.

532
00:28:50,329 --> 00:28:53,474
no More Than An Oncologist
Fetishizes Cancer.

533
00:28:53,498 --> 00:28:56,777
i Study It In The Hopes
Of Finding A Cure For It.

534
00:28:56,801 --> 00:28:58,491
i Don't Believe You.

535
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:01,115
i Think You Enjoy The Means Too Much

536
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:03,204
to Really Care About The End.

537
00:29:04,575 --> 00:29:06,286
i'm Not Talking About A Medicine.

538
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:08,288
i'm Talking About A Solution.

539
00:29:08,312 --> 00:29:10,412
an Alteration In Our Dna.

540
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:13,327
did You Know The Mole Rat
Can't Feel Burning Pain

541
00:29:13,351 --> 00:29:16,462
because It Lacks
The Chemical Substance P?

542
00:29:16,486 --> 00:29:18,713
you Want People To Be Like Mole Rats?

543
00:29:18,743 --> 00:29:21,222
i Want Us To Be Impervious To Pain.

544
00:29:21,959 --> 00:29:23,993
what A Terrible Idea.

545
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:30,244
spoken Like Someone Who's Never
Had His Pain Ignored,

546
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:33,291
who's Never Begged For Relief
And Not Gotten It.

547
00:29:33,315 --> 00:29:35,293
i'd Prefer To Have My Pain Ignored

548
00:29:35,317 --> 00:29:36,916
than To Have No Pain At All.

549
00:29:37,405 --> 00:29:40,658
without Pain, There Can Be
No Real Pleasure.

550
00:29:41,409 --> 00:29:45,670
without The Lows, You Have
No Way To Measure The Highs.

551
00:29:45,694 --> 00:29:50,508
if Any Part Of Your
Sadism-in-the-name-of-science

552
00:29:50,532 --> 00:29:55,048
is Designed To Improve
The Human Condition,

553
00:29:55,737 --> 00:29:57,081
making Us Unfeeling

554
00:29:57,105 --> 00:30:00,053
is Absolutely The Wrong Way
Of Going About It.

555
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:03,932
case In Point...

556
00:30:04,479 --> 00:30:08,181
this Is Gonna Make Killing You
Infinitely More Pleasurable.

557
00:30:11,353 --> 00:30:12,496
we're Ready.

558
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,031
how Much Time Has He Got?

559
00:30:14,055 --> 00:30:16,701
an Hour. Maybe Less.

560
00:30:16,725 --> 00:30:19,403
so, The Archive.

561
00:30:19,427 --> 00:30:22,873
like The Minister Says At
Every Wedding... Speak Now...

562
00:30:22,897 --> 00:30:25,765
or Forever Hold Your Peace.

563
00:30:33,399 --> 00:30:35,243
is There Anything On The Apb?

564
00:30:35,267 --> 00:30:37,305
not Yet. And On Your End?

565
00:30:37,329 --> 00:30:39,959
i've Called Everyone, But
Everything Is Taking Too Long.

566
00:30:39,984 --> 00:30:41,795
there Must Be Something
They Missed At The Scene.

567
00:30:41,819 --> 00:30:43,530
we've Reviewed All
The Crime-scene Analysis

568
00:30:43,554 --> 00:30:45,365
from Where You Were Held,
Plus What We Found...

569
00:30:45,389 --> 00:30:46,533
or Didn't Find... At The Van.

570
00:30:46,557 --> 00:30:48,635
then We Should Go Through It Again.

571
00:30:54,365 --> 00:30:56,343
you Take The Forensics From The Van.

572
00:30:56,367 --> 00:30:58,779
i'll Review The Findings From The Lab.

573
00:31:01,772 --> 00:31:05,285
don't Take This The Wrong Way,
But You'd Make A Good Cop.

574
00:31:05,309 --> 00:31:06,853
you Know What I Do For A Living.

575
00:31:06,877 --> 00:31:08,255
i Do.

576
00:31:08,279 --> 00:31:10,039
i Also Know Who You Are.

577
00:31:10,881 --> 00:31:12,542
a Black Muslim.

578
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:15,211
that Describes Quite A Few Cops.

579
00:31:16,353 --> 00:31:17,564
we Will Find Raymond.

580
00:31:17,588 --> 00:31:18,732
i Hope You're Right.

581
00:31:18,756 --> 00:31:20,200
but He Lives On The Edge.

582
00:31:20,224 --> 00:31:22,858
and One Day, He May Go Over It.

583
00:31:25,196 --> 00:31:28,074
the Report Says The Van
Was Burned Using An Accelerant.

584
00:31:28,098 --> 00:31:31,378
that's Right. Uh... Cyclohexane.

585
00:31:31,402 --> 00:31:33,747
which Burns At A Low Flash Point.

586
00:31:33,771 --> 00:31:35,515
that's Why There Were No Forensics.

587
00:31:35,539 --> 00:31:37,184
and What Does That Tell You?

588
00:31:37,208 --> 00:31:40,653
that The Absence Of Evidence Is Evidence.

589
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:59,505
it's Not Everything You Thought
It Would Be, Is It?

590
00:32:00,364 --> 00:32:02,216
this Moment?

591
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,422
you've Waited For It,

592
00:32:06,937 --> 00:32:09,371
anticipated It.

593
00:32:12,276 --> 00:32:14,312
but Somehow, It's...

594
00:32:15,786 --> 00:32:17,553
dissatisfying.

595
00:32:17,715 --> 00:32:20,568
it Actually Exceeds Expectation.

596
00:32:21,318 --> 00:32:23,488
i Wasn't Talking To You.

597
00:32:24,154 --> 00:32:27,241
we Know Who My Assassin Really Is...

598
00:32:28,725 --> 00:32:30,458
don't We, Elizabeth?

599
00:32:31,662 --> 00:32:37,543
it Saddens Me To Bear Witness
To This Moment In Your Life.

600
00:32:38,268 --> 00:32:39,712
this...

601
00:32:40,678 --> 00:32:43,758
crossing Of A Rubicon

602
00:32:44,241 --> 00:32:48,054
from Which You Can Never Get Back.

603
00:32:50,206 --> 00:32:55,209
i Know, In This Moment,
It May Appear Self-serving

604
00:32:55,419 --> 00:32:59,154
to Suggest That You Instruct

605
00:32:59,732 --> 00:33:01,968
the Good Doctor

606
00:33:01,992 --> 00:33:04,654
to Administer The Antidote,

607
00:33:05,529 --> 00:33:09,498
but I Strongly Suggest
That You Do Just That...

608
00:33:11,861 --> 00:33:13,204
because...

609
00:33:13,911 --> 00:33:15,444
i Have...

610
00:33:15,673 --> 00:33:18,807
seen The Other Side Of That River...

611
00:33:20,931 --> 00:33:25,600
and It's A Place I Never...

612
00:33:26,617 --> 00:33:28,783
never Wanted You To Go.

613
00:33:34,885 --> 00:33:36,370
who Is It?!

614
00:33:47,638 --> 00:33:49,249
i Said...

615
00:33:49,273 --> 00:33:51,651
dembe, Wait! Hold On!

616
00:33:51,675 --> 00:33:53,320
cyclohexane!

617
00:33:53,344 --> 00:33:55,021
your Accelerant.

618
00:33:55,045 --> 00:33:58,024
you Used It To Help Them Torch
The Van They Put Me In.

619
00:33:58,048 --> 00:33:59,025
wait. Stop.

620
00:33:59,049 --> 00:34:00,193
you Set Us Up!

621
00:34:00,217 --> 00:34:02,211
they Tortured Me!

622
00:34:02,753 --> 00:34:05,031
my Hand! They Made Me To Do It!

623
00:34:05,055 --> 00:34:06,933
where Is He?
They Weren't Supposed To Take You!

624
00:34:06,957 --> 00:34:08,602
they Were Looking For Reddington!

625
00:34:08,626 --> 00:34:10,489
well, Now They Have Him.
Yeah.

626
00:34:10,513 --> 00:34:13,264
ruddiger, Look At Me!

627
00:34:14,064 --> 00:34:16,411
i'm Gonna Make What That Woman
Did To Your Hand

628
00:34:16,435 --> 00:34:17,764
feel Like A Manicure

629
00:34:17,788 --> 00:34:20,938
unless You Tell Me
Where They Are Holding Raymond.

630
00:34:21,344 --> 00:34:23,811
ruddiger.
The Warehouse!

631
00:34:23,836 --> 00:34:27,438
east Of The Airport. Braxton And 9th.

632
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:32,346
the Radiator.

633
00:34:32,371 --> 00:34:33,938
tie Yourself To It.

634
00:34:34,018 --> 00:34:35,862
dembe, Please.
Now!

635
00:34:45,629 --> 00:34:48,030
he's Not Coming Back!

636
00:34:51,355 --> 00:34:53,521
he's Not Coming Back!

637
00:34:55,623 --> 00:34:59,391
what You're Experiencing
Is Unilateral Paralysis.

638
00:34:59,416 --> 00:35:01,916
your Diaphragm Is Partially Functioning

639
00:35:02,112 --> 00:35:05,959
as The Paralysis Moves Higher
Into The Chest Cavity.

640
00:35:05,983 --> 00:35:08,861
soon, Your Diaphragm
Will Be Completely Paralyzed

641
00:35:08,958 --> 00:35:12,426
and You'll Need A Machine
To Assist In Breathing.

642
00:35:12,451 --> 00:35:15,238
unfortunately For You,
We Have No Machine.

643
00:35:15,263 --> 00:35:17,477
but I Do Have This.

644
00:35:17,502 --> 00:35:20,289
the Doctor's Antidote
Takes Immediate Effect.

645
00:35:20,491 --> 00:35:22,858
you'll Be Breathing
Normally Within Seconds.

646
00:35:22,883 --> 00:35:25,316
all You Need To Do First

647
00:35:25,341 --> 00:35:28,943
is Tell Me What You Know
About The Archive.

648
00:35:32,289 --> 00:35:33,622
I'm Sorry, Say That Again?

649
00:35:33,647 --> 00:35:35,480
8353 Braxton.

650
00:35:35,505 --> 00:35:36,804
i'm Writing It Down.

651
00:35:36,847 --> 00:35:38,825
but Before I Sent Units,
I'd Like To Get Inside.

652
00:35:38,849 --> 00:35:40,159
there's No Time. I'll Explain Later.

653

671
00:36:52,855 --> 00:36:55,556
he Came Here To Save Himself.

00:36:57,439 --> 00:36:59,506
i Only See The Effect.

674
00:36:59,531 --> 00:37:02,475
i'm Standing Here
While He Can Barely Breathe.

675
00:37:03,497 --> 00:37:05,936

694
00:39:21,868 --> 00:39:26,749
that Townsend Paid Her In Cash
And Always Used A Burner Phone?

695
00:39:26,773 --> 00:39:29,018

It, But They're Not Optimistic.

00:39:38,285 --> 00:39:42,187
all Of This And Going
After Perillos Got Us Nothing.

700
00:39:43,523 --> 00:39:46,491
i Think We Both Know That's Not True.

701
00:39:46,931 --> 00:39:48,838
we Came For Each Other.

702
00:39:53,033 --> 00:39:55,745
