2
00:00:12,222 --> 00:00:13,399
Masha.

3
00:00:13,423 --> 00:00:15,457
Don't call me that.

4
00:00:17,427 --> 00:00:18,671
Your mother.

5
00:00:18,695 --> 00:00:20,706
You tried to murder my mother.

6
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:23,142
And you lied to me about Reddington,

7
00:00:23,166 --> 00:00:25,645
convinced me he was Ilya Koslov.

8
00:00:25,669 --> 00:00:27,613
That woman.

9
00:00:27,637 --> 00:00:31,050
You abducted me for her.
My mother's been...

10
00:00:31,074 --> 00:00:32,652
How hard can I push him?

11
00:00:32,676 --> 00:00:34,921
- You won't get away with this.
- I asked you...

12
00:00:34,945 --> 00:00:37,557
- And the people looking for her...
- ...how hard?

13
00:00:37,581 --> 00:00:40,526
...to hurt me or Agnes if it would
help them get what they want.

14
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:42,061
And I didn't abduct you for her.

15
00:00:42,085 --> 00:00:44,597
I abducted you for answers...
To make it stop.

16
00:00:44,621 --> 00:00:47,166
Help me understand.

17
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:49,602
For the first time,
stop protecting Reddington,

18
00:00:49,626 --> 00:00:51,537
and God knows who else,

19
00:00:51,561 --> 00:00:54,774
and make the decision
to protect your own family.

20
00:00:54,798 --> 00:00:59,245
Three generations of women
fighting to survive.

22
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:16,429
- Mr. Reddington, please.
- Take a swing, Eduardo.

23
00:01:16,453 --> 00:01:19,131
Go ahead. This is what you
wanted. Take your best shot.

24
00:01:19,155 --> 00:01:22,001
Because I assure you,
if you don't, I will.

25
00:01:22,025 --> 00:01:23,769
Mr. Reddington, please,
I would never betray you.

26
00:01:23,793 --> 00:01:25,972
Come on. Nice big swing.

27
00:01:25,996 --> 00:01:27,440
I told you... I swear...

28
00:01:27,464 --> 00:01:29,575
I didn't know your people
were the target.

29
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:31,644
If you're not gonna hit me, you
could at least say something hurtful.

30
00:01:31,668 --> 00:01:33,446
I mean, how am I supposed to
deal with this?

31
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:35,448
You're so plaintive,
I feel like I should apologize

32
00:01:35,472 --> 00:01:37,450
for your betrayal.

33
00:01:37,474 --> 00:01:40,486
You know what? I...
Just help me track the van.

34
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:43,222
Give me a VIN number, license
plate, whatever you've got.

35
00:01:43,246 --> 00:01:45,024
You know what I've got... Nothing.

36
00:01:45,048 --> 00:01:47,059
My clients don't want me
to be able to track them.

37
00:01:47,083 --> 00:01:49,795
But for you, if I had any idea
your people were in danger,

38
00:01:49,819 --> 00:01:51,697
I would've put a trace on the vehicle.

39
00:01:51,721 --> 00:01:55,001
But I didn't. Because I didn't know.

40
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:58,437
You're a good man, Eduardo.

41
00:01:58,461 --> 00:02:00,873
And I'm glad you didn't clock me
with the tire iron.

42
00:02:00,897 --> 00:02:03,843
I was thinking, "Boy,
that's really gonna hurt."

43
00:02:05,569 --> 00:02:07,496
- Anything?
- Not yet.

44
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,382
They must have a safe house nearby.

45
00:02:09,406 --> 00:02:11,150
We don't think they were
on the road for long.

46
00:02:11,174 --> 00:02:13,953
That's it? With all the sources
we pay for information?

47
00:02:13,977 --> 00:02:15,688
Everyone's looking.

48
00:02:15,712 --> 00:02:18,324
But wherever they are, they know
better than to show themselves.

49
00:02:18,348 --> 00:02:20,560
Dembe, Dom's too old.

50
00:02:20,584 --> 00:02:22,762
He'll try not to break,
but if they push him,

51
00:02:22,786 --> 00:02:24,519
he'll die trying.

52
00:02:26,823 --> 00:02:29,602
I'm terribly sorry about
the theatrics, Eduardo.

53
00:02:29,626 --> 00:02:31,003
I should have known better.

54
00:02:31,027 --> 00:02:34,206
I do hope I haven't made you
too uncomfortable.

55
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:38,277
Take Kate to Argonne.
Have dinner, a few laughs.

56
00:02:38,301 --> 00:02:41,080
I hear Chef Gilbert does a ris de veau

57
00:02:41,104 --> 00:02:43,549
that'll make your toes curl.

58
00:02:43,573 --> 00:02:45,184
Raymond, where are we going?

59
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:46,953
We need a lead. If we don't have one,

60
00:02:46,977 --> 00:02:49,355
we need to talk to people who might.

61
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:51,457
Tell me. Where are we?

62
00:02:51,481 --> 00:02:53,626
So far, we're working two possibilities.

63
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:55,394
Uh, first is this man.

64
00:02:55,418 --> 00:02:57,196
A roadside surveillance camera
picked him up

65
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,898
just before the spike strip deployed.

66
00:02:58,922 --> 00:03:01,133
We believe he placed the spike
strip at Keen's instruction.

67
00:03:01,157 --> 00:03:03,536
- Can we enhance the resolution?
- You're already looking at it.

68
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,404
- The plate's a fake.
- So how are we gonna find her?

69
00:03:05,428 --> 00:03:08,240
We can circulate this image
to local merchants, Metro PD,

70
00:03:08,264 --> 00:03:10,242
see what shakes loose, but problem is,

71
00:03:10,266 --> 00:03:12,912
how do we do that without exposing
Keen to a kidnapping charge?

72
00:03:12,936 --> 00:03:15,047
My question exactly.

73
00:03:15,071 --> 00:03:17,249
Please, tell me we had
better luck with the van.

74
00:03:17,273 --> 00:03:19,285
Not much. Surveillance feed
shows it continued north

75
00:03:19,309 --> 00:03:20,720
for another six-tenths of a mile.

76
00:03:20,744 --> 00:03:22,488
At that point, it turned
off the main road

77
00:03:22,512 --> 00:03:23,923
and took smaller surface streets.

78
00:03:23,947 --> 00:03:26,726
To avoid any cameras.
Keen knows what she's doing.

79
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:32,264
- What do you want?
- Our help.

80
00:03:32,288 --> 00:03:34,066
He wouldn't be here
unless he needed something.

81
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:36,535
Good to see you all, as well.

82
00:03:36,559 --> 00:03:40,106
Like it or not, I believe we're
all pulling on the same oar.

83
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:44,644
Harold, perhaps we could go find
a comfortable chair somewhere.

84
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,340
What are you looking at?

85
00:03:54,444 --> 00:03:56,122
You want to know if she's here.

86
00:03:56,146 --> 00:03:58,424
I know.

87
00:03:58,448 --> 00:04:02,094
Tell her to come out
where I can see her.

88
00:04:02,118 --> 00:04:05,398
She's not hiding. I asked her
to let us talk alone.

89
00:04:05,422 --> 00:04:08,607
I know you're not gonna
tell her the truth.

90
00:04:09,392 --> 00:04:12,772
I know a lot more than
the last time we talked.

91
00:04:18,635 --> 00:04:21,302
I know about the Sikorsky Archive.

92
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:23,872
That's right.

93
00:04:24,474 --> 00:04:26,274
And N-13.

94
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:29,021
Careful, Masha.

95
00:04:29,045 --> 00:04:33,059
Say "N-13" around the wrong
person at the wrong time,

96
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:35,428
and you won't live to regret it.

97
00:04:35,452 --> 00:04:37,263
I told you not to call me that.

98
00:04:37,287 --> 00:04:39,965
And I'm not the one in danger here.

99
00:04:39,989 --> 00:04:43,002
N-13 has the Archive, doesn't he?

100
00:04:43,026 --> 00:04:45,337
- Assuming it is a "he."
- Now, you listen to me...

101
00:04:45,361 --> 00:04:47,653
- It's Reddington, isn't it?
- He framed my mother.

102
00:04:47,696 --> 00:04:49,208
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

103
00:04:49,232 --> 00:04:51,043
If he doesn't have it,
you know who does.

104
00:04:51,067 --> 00:04:53,912
You're protecting someone.
Who could be so important

105
00:04:53,936 --> 00:04:55,114
that you would sacrifice your daughter?

106
00:04:55,138 --> 00:04:56,816
My daughter.

107
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,485
- Some daughter.
- Don't lie to me.

108
00:04:59,509 --> 00:05:01,420
I swear, it'll be better if you
just said nothing than...

109
00:05:01,444 --> 00:05:02,888
That's enough!

110
00:05:04,347 --> 00:05:06,859
You think I want this?

111
00:05:06,883 --> 00:05:10,696
To live with this, to die for this?

112
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,099
To keep these secrets?

113
00:05:13,123 --> 00:05:15,232
Then stop keeping them.

114
00:05:15,256 --> 00:05:16,335
I can't.

115
00:05:16,359 --> 00:05:18,804
You don't understand.

116
00:05:18,828 --> 00:05:23,375
Whatever secrets I know,
they're not mine to tell.

117
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:26,212
You don't have to believe me,

118
00:05:26,236 --> 00:05:28,848
but if I die, I'll know

119
00:05:28,872 --> 00:05:32,618
I did my best to protect you and Agnes.

120
00:05:32,642 --> 00:05:35,221
If you want to protect us,
stop keeping secrets that put us

121
00:05:35,245 --> 00:05:37,890
in danger and start
telling us the truth!

122
00:05:37,914 --> 00:05:40,459
- He needs to be sedated.
- We're not finished.

123
00:05:40,483 --> 00:05:41,961
You are for now.

124
00:05:48,158 --> 00:05:51,771
You want information. So you can
get to Agent Keen before we do.

125
00:05:51,795 --> 00:05:53,873
If history is any indication, Harold,

126
00:05:53,897 --> 00:05:56,342
you may never get to
Agent Keen without me.

127
00:05:56,366 --> 00:05:57,943
- We'll take our chances.
- Really?

128
00:05:57,967 --> 00:06:00,379
With an old man's life at stake?

129
00:06:00,403 --> 00:06:03,091
A sick old man in need of medical care?

130
00:06:03,115 --> 00:06:04,150
If he dies...

131
00:06:04,174 --> 00:06:07,520
If he dies, it'll be no less
your fault than hers.

132
00:06:07,544 --> 00:06:09,221
Imagine risking everything...

133
00:06:09,245 --> 00:06:11,490
Her career, a life with
her child, her freedom...

134
00:06:11,514 --> 00:06:13,225
All to get answers you already have.

135
00:06:13,249 --> 00:06:15,327
Oh, come on, Harold.
We've been over this.

136
00:06:15,351 --> 00:06:17,329
She's gone way too far.

137
00:06:17,353 --> 00:06:20,299
Felony abduction. Very possibly torture.

138
00:06:20,323 --> 00:06:22,902
Hell, she could kill
the old son of a bitch.

139
00:06:22,926 --> 00:06:24,235
She wouldn't.

140
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:26,472
What do you imagine she's doing, Donald?

141
00:06:26,496 --> 00:06:29,037
Saying, "Pretty please" "Mother, may I"?

142
00:06:29,061 --> 00:06:31,644
I'll tell you what she's not doing...
Behaving like you would.

143
00:06:31,668 --> 00:06:33,746
Boy, she played you.

144
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:37,483
She took advantage of your
rather significant blind spot

145
00:06:37,507 --> 00:06:40,686
- in matters of... the heart.
- What does that mean?

146
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:43,355
I mean that if this were
the high-school prom,

147
00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:46,125
she'd be the pretty loner
standing on the sidelines

148
00:06:46,149 --> 00:06:48,360
and you'd be the
second-string quarterback

149
00:06:48,384 --> 00:06:51,197
guzzling down the punch,
hoping to cop a feel off her

150
00:06:51,221 --> 00:06:53,065
- during "Stairway to Heaven."
- I've had enough of you!

151
00:06:53,089 --> 00:06:55,935
Okay. That's it.
That's enough. We're done here.

152
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:59,205
In fact, it's possible
after this we're done, period.

153
00:06:59,229 --> 00:07:02,575
If and when we find Agent Keen,
we'll let you know.

154
00:07:06,202 --> 00:07:09,048
- How'd it go?
- I placed it under his lapel.

155
00:07:14,844 --> 00:07:17,423
You want to release him?
You can't be serious.

156
00:07:17,447 --> 00:07:18,924
Look at him. He's unconscious.

157
00:07:18,948 --> 00:07:20,793
He's sedated, that's all.

158
00:07:20,817 --> 00:07:22,628
When this seizure subsides,
we can try again.

159
00:07:22,652 --> 00:07:24,330
And again and again.

160
00:07:24,354 --> 00:07:26,498
- He's not gonna talk.
- Oh, he will.

161
00:07:26,522 --> 00:07:28,267
Not willingly.

162
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:30,903
But he's too old to withstand
a more aggressive approach.

163
00:07:30,927 --> 00:07:31,873
No.

164
00:07:31,897 --> 00:07:33,739
You understood what we were doing here.

165
00:07:33,763 --> 00:07:35,074
We agreed not to stop...

166
00:07:35,098 --> 00:07:37,576
- Until what?
- Don't give me that look.

167
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,045
I've been crystal clear about
how far I've been willing to go.

168
00:07:40,069 --> 00:07:41,447
You said you were in agreement.

169
00:07:41,471 --> 00:07:43,082
I know what I said, but I can't,

170
00:07:43,106 --> 00:07:46,018
not if it means torturing
an 80-year-old man.

171
00:07:46,042 --> 00:07:48,120
Whatever he's done,
he's still your father.

172
00:07:48,144 --> 00:07:50,122
- And my grandfather.
- So what now?

173
00:07:50,146 --> 00:07:52,313
We can't just take him back
where he came from.

174
00:07:52,948 --> 00:07:54,460
Maybe we can.

175
00:07:54,484 --> 00:07:56,795
Let me make a call.

176
00:07:56,819 --> 00:07:59,665
Katarina. Mother!

177
00:08:05,228 --> 00:08:07,840
I need to know you're
not going to hurt him.

178
00:08:07,864 --> 00:08:10,364
You've never called me that.

179
00:08:11,395 --> 00:08:13,145
You won't, will you?

180
00:08:24,547 --> 00:08:26,125
- Ressler.
- It's me.

181
00:08:26,149 --> 00:08:27,893
Where are you? Are you alright?

182
00:08:27,917 --> 00:08:30,763
I'm okay, but this was a mistake.

183
00:08:30,787 --> 00:08:32,298
Cooper's going out of his mind.

184
00:08:32,322 --> 00:08:35,301
I need help with Dom...
Equipment, medications.

185
00:08:35,325 --> 00:08:36,702
Same place as last time?

186
00:08:36,726 --> 00:08:38,170
I'll be there.

187
00:08:38,194 --> 00:08:39,939
30 minutes.

188
00:08:41,297 --> 00:08:44,276
We should have Chuck
and Morgan follow Donald.

189
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:47,234
I want to know as soon
as they make contact.

190
00:08:53,234 --> 00:08:55,846
- Is it done?
- He's conscious.

191
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:58,148
The seizure has abated, but I'm
concerned that he might have...

192
00:08:58,172 --> 00:09:00,784
I'm aware of your concerns, Doctor.

193
00:09:00,808 --> 00:09:02,286
You've made them very clear.

194
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:04,088
No, you don't understand.

195
00:09:04,112 --> 00:09:06,023
He's having some kind of episode.

196
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:18,299
_

197
00:09:18,426 --> 00:09:20,137
He's been drifting
in and out of Russian.

198
00:09:20,161 --> 00:09:22,239
Calling for a woman named Lena.
Do you know who that is?

199
00:09:22,263 --> 00:09:25,998
Lena Volkova. She was his wife.

200
00:09:28,536 --> 00:09:31,596
Dom. Can you hear me?

201
00:09:32,707 --> 00:09:34,516
Lena's not here.

202
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:37,977
Dom, open your eyes.

203
00:09:44,552 --> 00:09:46,361
It's you.

204
00:09:47,622 --> 00:09:49,566
You're here.

205
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:51,883
I'm here.

206
00:09:52,627 --> 00:09:55,912
He gave you back to me.

207
00:09:56,731 --> 00:09:59,810
I thought I'd lost you forever.

208
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:24,201
- Any movement?
- Negative.

209
00:10:24,225 --> 00:10:26,870
- He's still parked under the overpass.
- How does that work?

210
00:10:26,894 --> 00:10:29,729
Is he "under an overpass"
or "in an underpass"?

211
00:10:34,068 --> 00:10:37,081
Stand by. I got a car coming in.

212
00:10:46,681 --> 00:10:48,726
It's Agent Keen.
She's walking to his car.

213
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:51,128
- What now?
- Let's just wait and see.

214
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:02,139
- Keen, I...
- Don't say it.

215
00:11:02,163 --> 00:11:03,941
Don't say what exactly?

216
00:11:03,965 --> 00:11:05,809
Of the 10,000 things I should say...

217
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:07,111
Ressler.

218
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:08,812
What, don't commit felony kidnapping?

219
00:11:08,836 --> 00:11:10,581
Don't betray everyone you work with?

220
00:11:10,605 --> 00:11:13,117
The only people who've proven
over the last seven years

221
00:11:13,141 --> 00:11:15,018
how much they actually care about you.

222
00:11:15,042 --> 00:11:17,452
It's done. I made my choices.

223
00:11:17,912 --> 00:11:19,857
And I'm not here for your
forgiveness or approval.

224
00:11:19,881 --> 00:11:21,992
Then what are you here for?
Why did you call me?

225
00:11:22,016 --> 00:11:23,373
Just to inform me that you're torturing

226
00:11:23,397 --> 00:11:24,387
your grandfather for information?

227
00:11:24,411 --> 00:11:26,964
No one's being tortured. Come
on. You know me better than that.

228
00:11:26,988 --> 00:11:28,999
Do I? See, I thought I did,

229
00:11:29,023 --> 00:11:31,957
but lately, boy,
you're full of surprises.

230
00:11:32,894 --> 00:11:34,338
He's in a safe house...

231
00:11:34,362 --> 00:11:36,106
in the warehouse district.

232
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:38,175
With your mother, the woman
who shot him in the chest!

233
00:11:38,199 --> 00:11:40,344
- She's not gonna hurt him.
- Oh, and you believe her.

234
00:11:40,368 --> 00:11:42,301
Well, you got it all figured out.

235
00:11:44,372 --> 00:11:46,016
He had another seizure.

236
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:49,186
We need more doctors,
advanced equipment.

237
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:51,088
So that's why you called me.

238
00:11:51,112 --> 00:11:52,556
He needs more doctors?

239
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:55,526
He has answers. All of them.

240
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:58,796
I thought if he wouldn't talk
to her, he'd talk to me,

241
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,631
have some human response

242
00:12:00,655 --> 00:12:03,100
to his granddaughter pleading for help.

243
00:12:03,124 --> 00:12:05,157
And he said nothing?

244
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,172
It's my mistake.

245
00:12:08,196 --> 00:12:11,664
Whatever humanity he had
died a long time ago.

246
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:23,053
- What's happening to him?
- It's not uncommon for seizure patients

247
00:12:23,077 --> 00:12:25,756
to experience delusions,
even hallucinations.

248
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:27,691
He's talking like it's years ago.

249
00:12:27,715 --> 00:12:29,793
He's lost any sense of time.

250
00:12:29,817 --> 00:12:31,595
I can administer an antipsychotic.

251
00:12:31,619 --> 00:12:34,097
It may work to block the
dopamine and serotonin in the brain.

252
00:12:34,121 --> 00:12:35,833
- No.
- No? I don't understand.

253
00:12:35,857 --> 00:12:37,501
I want the truth, Doctor.

254
00:12:37,525 --> 00:12:39,536
And I don't care if he tells
the woman I am now

255
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,171
or the woman I was then.

256
00:12:43,297 --> 00:12:44,441
Papa.

257
00:12:44,465 --> 00:12:47,833
_

258
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:50,351
_

259
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:53,938
_

260
00:12:57,445 --> 00:12:58,956
Tell me where he is.

261
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,757
I'll go myself with a transport van,

262
00:13:00,781 --> 00:13:02,815
get him whatever help he needs.

263
00:13:04,085 --> 00:13:05,495
And what about my mother?

264
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,264
Liz, you know this has to end.

265
00:13:07,288 --> 00:13:09,399
I know how Reddington wants it to end.

266
00:13:09,423 --> 00:13:11,568
Or how it'll end if you go by the book.

267
00:13:11,592 --> 00:13:14,037
But can't you just ignore
the rules, just this one time?

268
00:13:14,061 --> 00:13:15,973
Think about what you're asking me to do.

269
00:13:15,997 --> 00:13:19,776
She tortured Reddington,
shot Dom, abducted Dembe's imam.

270
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,712
To save her own life! And mine!

271
00:13:21,736 --> 00:13:23,413
Liz, listen to me.

272
00:13:23,437 --> 00:13:26,183
You're on this quest to find
answers about your family.

273
00:13:26,207 --> 00:13:29,152
Well, I'm as close to family as you got,

274
00:13:29,176 --> 00:13:32,389
and I'm telling you... if you
don't stop protecting her,

275
00:13:32,413 --> 00:13:35,281
you'll end up destroying yourself.

276
00:13:36,784 --> 00:13:38,250
I'm sorry.

277
00:13:39,406 --> 00:13:40,548
Don't be.

278
00:13:40,572 --> 00:13:42,199
I shouldn't have put
you in this position.

279
00:13:42,223 --> 00:13:44,101
You don't have anything
to apologize for.

280
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:47,993
I would do anything for you if I could.

281
00:13:49,463 --> 00:13:51,797
But you can't do this.

282
00:13:54,435 --> 00:13:57,781
Now I'm the one who's sorry.

283
00:14:03,044 --> 00:14:04,054
Keen's on the move.

284
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:05,953
Let her go, Raymond.

285
00:14:06,647 --> 00:14:08,558
Lock it down, Chuck.

286
00:14:13,688 --> 00:14:15,565
Ressler!

287
00:14:24,283 --> 00:14:26,283
We're good here. Targets secure.

288
00:14:36,241 --> 00:14:38,552
Listen to me.

289
00:14:38,576 --> 00:14:41,088
I know what you're planning.

290
00:14:41,112 --> 00:14:45,126
I know you think it's your only way out.

291
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:46,494
What I'm planning?

292
00:14:46,518 --> 00:14:49,697
I know you're in danger.

293
00:14:49,721 --> 00:14:53,200
In danger? I'm being hunted.

294
00:14:53,224 --> 00:14:56,570
They will stop at nothing until
they find me and destroy me.

295
00:14:56,594 --> 00:14:59,640
We can handle the Cabal.

296
00:14:59,664 --> 00:15:01,709
You're not listening. It's Townsend.

297
00:15:01,733 --> 00:15:04,812
They put a bounty on my head.
I have to run.

298
00:15:04,836 --> 00:15:07,281
No! You can't leave me again.

299
00:15:07,305 --> 00:15:09,639
_

300
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:12,888
_

301
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,665
_

302
00:15:16,848 --> 00:15:18,359
Sikorsky?

303
00:15:18,383 --> 00:15:21,395
Yes. Yes. Help me stop them.

304
00:15:21,419 --> 00:15:24,665
Help me understand
why they think I took it.

305
00:15:24,689 --> 00:15:27,201
Because you did.

306
00:15:27,225 --> 00:15:29,336
What are you talking about?

307
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,838
I can help you.

308
00:15:30,862 --> 00:15:34,475
But what you are planning, it...

309
00:15:34,499 --> 00:15:36,443
It breaks my heart.

310
00:15:40,238 --> 00:15:43,417
We know Katarina is holding Dom
somewhere in this 2-mile radius.

311
00:15:43,441 --> 00:15:45,319
I want every building scrutinized.

312
00:15:45,343 --> 00:15:48,055
See if they're occupied
and, if so, by whom.

313
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:51,325
Any abandoned buildings
get top priority.

314
00:15:51,349 --> 00:15:53,194
I have six teams mobilizing.

315
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:56,730
She chose this area 'cause it's
filled with midsize warehouses.

316
00:15:56,754 --> 00:16:00,601
Here. These six blocks.
Two dozen structures.

317
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:03,504
That's where I'd go.
So that's where she'll be.

318
00:16:11,069 --> 00:16:13,347
- You followed me?
- Of course I didn't.

319
00:16:13,371 --> 00:16:15,816
I had you followed.
Take it easy, Donald.

320
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,385
The veins on your neck are straining.

321
00:16:18,409 --> 00:16:20,654
You don't want a ruptured aneurysm.

322
00:16:20,678 --> 00:16:25,559
As for you, I can't begin to
describe my disappointment.

323
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:27,494
- Oh, thank God.
- Be disappointed all you want.

324
00:16:27,518 --> 00:16:29,663
She's still a federal agent.
And so am I.

325
00:16:29,687 --> 00:16:30,998
You can't hold us!

326
00:16:31,022 --> 00:16:32,833
You and Harold... Always telling me

327
00:16:32,857 --> 00:16:35,469
what I can't do while I'm doing it.

328
00:16:35,493 --> 00:16:37,771
Tell you what. Why don't we
split the difference?

329
00:16:37,795 --> 00:16:40,774
You go, Agent Keen can stay with me.

330
00:16:40,798 --> 00:16:42,209
I won't tell you where she is.

331
00:16:42,233 --> 00:16:44,044
Then I won't ask.

332
00:16:44,068 --> 00:16:46,513
Run along, Donald. Call in the cavalry.

333
00:16:46,537 --> 00:16:48,082
I've got quite a head start.

334
00:16:48,106 --> 00:16:50,551
The FBI won't find them before I do.

335
00:16:58,082 --> 00:16:59,348
Tea?

336
00:17:00,518 --> 00:17:03,664
You can't be on board with this.
I mean, he's out of control!

337
00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:07,568
Promise me he won't harm Keen.

338
00:17:07,592 --> 00:17:09,603
He won't.

339
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:23,183
Do forgive me, Harold, but
I'm a little busy at the moment.

340
00:17:23,207 --> 00:17:25,085
I know what you're doing, and
I'm calling to tell you to stop!

341
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:27,354
You're angry. That's understandable.

342
00:17:27,378 --> 00:17:30,291
I would be, too, if my agent snuck away

343
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:32,726
to have a secret meeting with the woman

344
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:35,162
my task force was searching for.

345
00:17:35,186 --> 00:17:37,665
That's for me to deal with.
Is it true you're holding Keen?

346
00:17:37,689 --> 00:17:39,433
Well, what choice do I have?

347
00:17:39,457 --> 00:17:42,836
If I let her go,
she'll warn Grendel's mother.

348
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:45,472
We've talked about that. Elizabeth's
mother is not to be harmed.

349
00:17:45,496 --> 00:17:47,975
- And I agreed. Anything else?
- I'm not kidding, Reddington.

350
00:17:47,999 --> 00:17:51,211
Well, you don't sound like
you're kidding, Harold.

351
00:17:51,235 --> 00:17:53,647
But you've always known
where this is headed.

352
00:17:53,671 --> 00:17:55,349
What she's done must be avenged.

353
00:17:55,373 --> 00:17:56,884
Not by her murder.

354
00:17:56,908 --> 00:17:59,086
When it's over, I'll look up
and see what remains.

355
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:02,389
If there are any bridges, I'll
cross them when I get there.

356
00:18:07,732 --> 00:18:09,196
Get our people to
the warehouse district.

357
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:11,165
Bring Agents Mojtabai and Park
up to speed.

358
00:18:11,189 --> 00:18:14,201
It's a long shot, but maybe
we can find them first.

359
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:16,403
I need a name.

360
00:18:16,427 --> 00:18:18,872
It's not enough to say I was framed.

361
00:18:18,896 --> 00:18:21,497
I need to prove who has the Archive.

362
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,445
- You know.
- It wasn't me.

363
00:18:24,469 --> 00:18:26,880
Why are you saying that?

364
00:18:26,904 --> 00:18:28,849
Okay, it doesn't matter
who took it back then.

365
00:18:28,873 --> 00:18:31,427
What matters is who has it now.

366
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:33,754
I need a name.

367
00:18:36,848 --> 00:18:39,193
Is it Reddington?

368
00:18:39,217 --> 00:18:41,017
Is he the one you're protecting?

369
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:46,400
Goodbye, Papa.

370
00:18:46,424 --> 00:18:47,835
No! Don't go!

371
00:18:47,859 --> 00:18:49,269
I have to go.

372
00:18:49,293 --> 00:18:51,138
They're coming for me. They're close.

373
00:18:51,162 --> 00:18:54,163
If I don't leave now,
they'll kill us all.

374
00:18:57,068 --> 00:18:58,334
Reddington.

375
00:18:59,537 --> 00:19:01,315
Reddington. He has the Archive?

376
00:19:01,339 --> 00:19:03,042
Yes.

377
00:19:03,841 --> 00:19:06,787
You took it, but he has it.

378
00:19:06,811 --> 00:19:08,522
And so do you.

379
00:19:08,546 --> 00:19:10,758
We both have it?

380
00:19:10,782 --> 00:19:13,716
How is that possible?
Tell me what you mean.

381
00:19:16,554 --> 00:19:20,300
Tell me now, or you won't see me again.

382
00:19:37,408 --> 00:19:39,575
How long have you been helping her?

383
00:19:41,179 --> 00:19:43,590
That's how you know
about Ilya, isn't it?

384
00:19:43,614 --> 00:19:46,226
You were there when
she was questioning him,

385
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,050
helped her get away.

386
00:19:49,921 --> 00:19:52,132
You know you can't trust
that woman, right?

387
00:19:52,156 --> 00:19:54,101
That woman is my mother.

388
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:57,193
Oh, she's just using that
to exploit you.

389
00:19:58,113 --> 00:19:59,239
Why?

390
00:19:59,263 --> 00:20:02,465
So you'd do exactly
what you've already done.

391
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:07,937
I know about the Sikorsky Archive.

392
00:20:09,207 --> 00:20:11,752
That's why the Townsend
Directive was issued.

393
00:20:11,776 --> 00:20:13,454
She was framed.

394
00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:16,457
Is that the story she told you?

395
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:19,815
She's a victim?
An innocent wrongly accused?

396
00:20:20,818 --> 00:20:23,122
Are you N-13?

397
00:20:24,331 --> 00:20:27,323
Because she certainly believes you are.

398
00:20:30,761 --> 00:20:34,007
Do you have it? The Archive?

399
00:20:34,031 --> 00:20:36,643
I see. So this is a ghost story.

400
00:20:36,667 --> 00:20:38,245
And you believe her.

401
00:20:38,269 --> 00:20:40,472
What choice do I have?

402
00:20:41,172 --> 00:20:43,016
She's the one looking for answers.

403
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,674
You're the one hiding them.

404
00:20:47,778 --> 00:20:50,290
Maybe she's not telling me everything.

405
00:20:50,314 --> 00:20:53,315
Do I still have questions? Of course.

406
00:20:55,553 --> 00:20:59,166
But for now, the only one
I need to answer is this...

407
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:02,569
Am I willing to let you kill her?

408
00:21:02,593 --> 00:21:05,427
And the answer is no.

409
00:21:10,701 --> 00:21:12,880
- What's the word?
- I think we found her.

410
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:15,182
It's a medium-size
shipping complex on Paxton,

411
00:21:15,206 --> 00:21:16,615
only nothing's getting shipped

412
00:21:16,639 --> 00:21:18,352
'cause the company went
bankrupt six weeks ago.

413
00:21:18,376 --> 00:21:20,087
It's a good spot for a safe
house... easy in and out,

414
00:21:20,111 --> 00:21:21,355
close to the main roads out of town.

415
00:21:21,379 --> 00:21:22,589
Any movement?

416
00:21:22,613 --> 00:21:24,591
Definitely. Bud popped the lock.

417
00:21:24,615 --> 00:21:26,793
We can't see who,
but there's people inside.

418
00:21:26,817 --> 00:21:28,695
I'll see you there.

419
00:21:38,229 --> 00:21:40,991
If you hurt her, we're done.

420
00:21:42,284 --> 00:21:44,478
Understand?

421
00:21:44,502 --> 00:21:46,947
Whatever this is,

422
00:21:46,971 --> 00:21:49,917
whatever relationship we had or have,

423
00:21:49,941 --> 00:21:51,919
will be over.

424
00:22:29,146 --> 00:22:30,757
Hands! Show me your hands!

425
00:22:30,781 --> 00:22:32,325
- Don't shoot. It's me.
- Where is she?

426
00:22:32,349 --> 00:22:33,560
- Gone.
- How long ago?

427
00:22:33,584 --> 00:22:35,562
A-A few minutes.

428
00:22:40,008 --> 00:22:41,286
Dom.

429
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:43,121
Dom.

430
00:22:43,145 --> 00:22:44,805
It's Raymond.

431
00:22:45,647 --> 00:22:47,425
Raymond.

432
00:22:49,718 --> 00:22:51,296
You're too late.

433
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,564
S-She was here.

434
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:58,694
I...

435
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:01,339
I told her.

436
00:23:01,363 --> 00:23:03,208
Told her what?

437
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:08,580
Dom. What did you tell her?

438
00:23:11,406 --> 00:23:13,785
Everything.

439
00:23:54,216 --> 00:23:56,194
We just crossed into
the warehouse district.

440
00:23:56,218 --> 00:23:57,962
Focus on the streets east of the pier.

441
00:23:57,986 --> 00:23:59,931
We're scrambling units.
I don't like our chances.

442
00:23:59,955 --> 00:24:01,733
I don't think we're gonna
find that warehouse

443
00:24:01,757 --> 00:24:03,368
- before Reddington does.
- Actually, maybe

444
00:24:03,392 --> 00:24:05,403
they already have.
I'm looking at satellite feeds,

445
00:24:05,427 --> 00:24:07,772
and there is a lot of activity
on Paxton Ave.

446
00:24:07,796 --> 00:24:09,507
Copy that.

447
00:24:16,471 --> 00:24:17,773
Dembe.

448
00:24:20,776 --> 00:24:22,236
Dembe, look at me.

449
00:24:26,181 --> 00:24:28,393
Please. She's my mother.

450
00:24:28,417 --> 00:24:30,562
You can't let him kill her.

451
00:24:37,926 --> 00:24:39,370
You know this is wrong!

452
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:41,506
Why are you helping him?!

453
00:24:43,532 --> 00:24:45,243
I can't answer that.

454
00:24:47,269 --> 00:24:48,887
Let me go.

455
00:24:49,371 --> 00:24:51,649
Let me try and stop him.

456
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:58,021
It's okay, Dom.

457
00:24:58,647 --> 00:25:00,758
Everything's gonna be okay.

458
00:25:00,782 --> 00:25:03,328
Mr. Reddington, I need
additional equipment.

459
00:25:03,352 --> 00:25:05,797
His heart rate is irregular,
blood pressure's spiking.

460
00:25:07,489 --> 00:25:10,924
You said I'd never see her again.

461
00:25:12,461 --> 00:25:16,441
But she... she came.

462
00:25:16,465 --> 00:25:17,909
Mr. Reddington, I really...

463
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:21,295
Thank you, Doctor.
You've done everything you can.

464
00:25:23,046 --> 00:25:24,971
I held her hand.

465
00:25:26,508 --> 00:25:29,220
Touched her face.

466
00:25:31,413 --> 00:25:33,265
At least...

467
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:37,811
I got to say goodbye to her.

468
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,397
Yes.

469
00:25:40,722 --> 00:25:42,756
My daughter.

470
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:48,106
My Katarina.

471
00:25:52,768 --> 00:25:54,620
She loves you.

472
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,019
She always has.

473
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:08,092
Nothing can ever change that.

474
00:26:47,556 --> 00:26:48,833
I got eyes!

475
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:50,935
Target heading north on Ridgemont.

476
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,611
You can check the
purchase order tomorrow morning

477
00:27:00,635 --> 00:27:01,813
when they're back at the office.

478
00:27:01,837 --> 00:27:04,582
Will do. Have a good night, Carol.

479
00:27:09,978 --> 00:27:10,988
Carol?

480
00:27:11,012 --> 00:27:12,757
Yes. Hi.

481
00:27:12,781 --> 00:27:14,058
I'm sorry. Do we know each other?

482
00:27:14,082 --> 00:27:16,094
I thought that was you.

483
00:27:16,118 --> 00:27:19,497
Donna Hays. We met
a few weeks ago at John Adams.

484
00:27:19,521 --> 00:27:21,365
Right. Donna. How are you?

485
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:23,835
- So good.
- I'm sorry. Remind me again

486
00:27:23,859 --> 00:27:25,369
- how you're connected to the s...
- There.

487
00:27:25,393 --> 00:27:28,506
The keys. Give me your keys.

488
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:29,874
Cover the exit!

489
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:57,117
Reddington.

490
00:28:05,567 --> 00:28:07,411
You can try and spread the blame
around all you want,

491
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:08,913
but this is on you.

492
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:11,849
Keen was looking for answers...
Answers that you have.

493
00:28:11,873 --> 00:28:15,820
If anyone's responsible
for this man's death, it's you.

494
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:37,949
You're probably right.

495
00:28:51,025 --> 00:28:53,637
Dom's dead, Dembe.

496
00:28:55,563 --> 00:28:59,143
- No.
- He's dead.

497
00:28:59,167 --> 00:29:02,079
And she's gone.

498
00:29:02,103 --> 00:29:03,380
Raymond, I'm sorry.

499
00:29:03,404 --> 00:29:05,349
She knows everything.

500
00:29:05,373 --> 00:29:08,218
So we have to find her.
We have a plate number

501
00:29:08,242 --> 00:29:10,263
for the car she's driving.

502
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,434
It won't last long.

503
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:12,669
If she does know...

504
00:29:12,693 --> 00:29:14,504
There's only one move she can make.

505
00:29:14,528 --> 00:29:16,506
Our best chance is to intercept it.

506
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:17,774
That's dangerous.

507
00:29:17,798 --> 00:29:19,409
I have Chuck and the others.

508
00:29:19,433 --> 00:29:20,910
I should be with you.

509
00:29:20,934 --> 00:29:23,079
Take Elizabeth to the apartment.
Hold her there.

510
00:29:23,103 --> 00:29:25,580
I'll call you when this part's done.

511
00:29:50,397 --> 00:29:51,841
Hey. Boss expecting company?

512
00:29:51,865 --> 00:29:53,376
Negative. Nothing on the schedule.

513
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,445
Oh! Oh, oh, oh.

514
00:29:55,469 --> 00:29:58,280
Roll down your window, sir.

515
00:29:59,139 --> 00:30:01,449
Hey, we got a wise guy here.

516
00:30:02,242 --> 00:30:03,753
Open up.

517
00:30:17,858 --> 00:30:19,769
Mr. Heidegger's office.

518
00:30:19,793 --> 00:30:21,004
Mr. Heidegger, please.

519
00:30:21,028 --> 00:30:22,305
I'm sorry. He's not in right now.

520
00:30:22,329 --> 00:30:23,573
Can I take a message?

521
00:30:23,597 --> 00:30:25,341
It's urgent that I speak with him.

522
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:26,543
A personal emergency.

523
00:30:26,567 --> 00:30:27,911
May I ask who's calling?

524
00:30:27,935 --> 00:30:30,079
Katarina Rostova.

525
00:30:30,103 --> 00:30:31,681
- I'm sorry. Could you...
- You heard me.

526
00:30:31,705 --> 00:30:33,383
Put him on the line.

527
00:30:35,509 --> 00:30:38,821
I understand. We all thought so, Susan.

528
00:30:40,447 --> 00:30:43,660
No, you did the right thing
calling me at home.

529
00:30:43,684 --> 00:30:45,361
Go ahead and put her through.

530
00:30:49,189 --> 00:30:51,935
This is Heidegger.
To whom am I speaking?

531
00:30:51,959 --> 00:30:54,871
You already know.
That's why you took the call.

532
00:30:54,895 --> 00:30:57,006
Dear lady, I don't know
who you think you've reached,

533
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:59,142
but there's some misunderstanding.

534
00:30:59,166 --> 00:31:01,010
You're William Heidegger.

535
00:31:01,034 --> 00:31:02,845
The highest-ranking representative

536
00:31:02,869 --> 00:31:06,015
of the Townsend Organization
in the Western Hemisphere.

537
00:31:06,039 --> 00:31:08,551
Well, whoever I am is irrelevant.

538
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:10,653
Katarina Rostova is dead.

539
00:31:10,677 --> 00:31:12,655
You believe the Kazanjian
Brothers killed me

540
00:31:12,679 --> 00:31:14,290
because that's what
I wanted you to believe.

541
00:31:14,314 --> 00:31:15,959
It was a good plan.

542
00:31:15,983 --> 00:31:17,961
It tricked Townsend into
paying the bounty on my head,

543
00:31:17,985 --> 00:31:20,363
part of which I used
to prove my innocence.

544
00:31:20,387 --> 00:31:22,165
Assuming, for the sake of discussion,

545
00:31:22,189 --> 00:31:24,601
you are who you claim to be,

546
00:31:24,625 --> 00:31:27,170
what proof could you possibly have?

547
00:31:27,194 --> 00:31:29,955
I have the identity of N-13.

548
00:31:30,631 --> 00:31:32,775
You're N-13.

549
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:34,209
No.

550
00:31:34,868 --> 00:31:36,713
But I know who is.

551
00:31:36,737 --> 00:31:38,281
And I'm willing to give you his name

552
00:31:38,305 --> 00:31:41,150
in exchange for my safety.

553
00:31:44,044 --> 00:31:46,823
There's a park on the corner
of Wabash and Grant.

554
00:31:46,847 --> 00:31:49,292
I take my granddaughter there
to feed the ducks.

555
00:31:49,316 --> 00:31:51,260
West benches. Will that do?

556
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:52,695
I'll be there.

557
00:31:58,125 --> 00:31:59,669
Well done, William.

558
00:31:59,693 --> 00:32:01,070
You won't survive this.

559
00:32:01,094 --> 00:32:03,006
I appreciate your concern.

560
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:05,541
Oddly enough, I was about to
say the same thing to you.

561
00:32:16,943 --> 00:32:19,055
- Raymond.
- We were right.

562
00:32:19,079 --> 00:32:21,691
She reached out to Heidegger,
set a meeting.

563
00:32:21,715 --> 00:32:23,326
I'll text you the address.

564
00:32:28,822 --> 00:32:30,599
Is it done?

565
00:32:31,291 --> 00:32:33,101
Did he kill her?

566
00:32:35,862 --> 00:32:37,874
I know you're not gonna help me,

567
00:32:37,898 --> 00:32:39,676
but you could at least have the decency

568
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:42,578
to tell me
whether or not my mother's dead.

569
00:32:44,705 --> 00:32:46,883
I know you're loyal to him,

570
00:32:46,907 --> 00:32:50,243
and I'm not asking you to be disloyal.

571
00:32:51,111 --> 00:32:54,023
But I do have a right to know.

572
00:32:55,949 --> 00:32:59,377
Your grandfather, Dom.

573
00:33:00,287 --> 00:33:02,198
He passed.

574
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,636
I'm sorry.

575
00:33:12,199 --> 00:33:15,011
You asked why I'm still helping Raymond.

576
00:33:15,035 --> 00:33:18,748
And I said I didn't know
anymore, but that's not true.

577
00:33:31,084 --> 00:33:34,430
I know it seems like
Raymond can be selfish

578
00:33:34,454 --> 00:33:35,865
and sometimes cruel.

579
00:33:35,889 --> 00:33:37,916
Sometimes?

580
00:33:39,226 --> 00:33:41,938
He's killed everyone
I've ever cared about.

581
00:33:41,962 --> 00:33:44,573
My father, my husband, my grandfather.

582
00:33:44,597 --> 00:33:45,942
And now you're dropping me off?

583
00:33:45,966 --> 00:33:48,244
Why? So you can help him
kill my mother, too?

584
00:33:48,268 --> 00:33:49,779
It isn't what it appears to be.

585
00:33:49,803 --> 00:33:52,448
I was always glad you were in his life.

586
00:33:52,472 --> 00:33:54,584
He had a better angel

587
00:33:54,608 --> 00:33:57,754
that might influence his behavior.

588
00:33:57,778 --> 00:33:59,856
But now I know you're not.

589
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,891
You can't.

590
00:34:01,915 --> 00:34:04,260
You're no better than he is.

591
00:34:08,555 --> 00:34:10,833
I can't anymore.

592
00:34:10,857 --> 00:34:12,969
I'm done.

593
00:34:16,096 --> 00:34:18,873
I can't fight him anymore.

594
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:22,252
He wins.

595
00:34:23,336 --> 00:34:25,422
He always wins.

596
00:34:48,195 --> 00:34:50,840
He's not gonna win this time!

597
00:35:28,607 --> 00:35:30,017
Before you get any ideas,

598
00:35:30,041 --> 00:35:32,186
I have teams watching from every angle,

599
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:34,388
and I'm armed.

600
00:35:36,381 --> 00:35:39,227
Reddington is N-13.

601
00:35:39,251 --> 00:35:41,062
He has the Archive.

602
00:35:41,086 --> 00:35:43,898
He's the one you've been looking for.

603
00:35:46,391 --> 00:35:48,505
Say something.

604
00:35:49,928 --> 00:35:51,716
Did you hear me?!

605
00:35:52,864 --> 00:35:55,610
No, I don't believe he did.

606
00:36:00,705 --> 00:36:02,435
The pistol.

607
00:36:14,519 --> 00:36:16,533
Dominic's dead.

608
00:36:17,422 --> 00:36:19,867
He wasn't when I left him.

609
00:36:19,891 --> 00:36:21,669
No matter. You killed him,

610
00:36:21,693 --> 00:36:25,473
just as sure as I killed
poor Heidegger there.

611
00:36:25,497 --> 00:36:28,709
Am I supposed to feel
something about that?

612
00:36:28,733 --> 00:36:30,411
Dom set me up,

613
00:36:30,435 --> 00:36:34,115
led me to what was supposed
to be my public slaughter.

614
00:36:34,139 --> 00:36:35,783
Think what you want,

615
00:36:35,807 --> 00:36:38,519
but I won't be shedding
any tears for that monster.

616
00:36:38,543 --> 00:36:40,755
No, I wouldn't think so.

617
00:36:47,173 --> 00:36:48,996
You've reached
Elizabeth Keen's voicemail.

618
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:51,132
Please leave me a message.

619
00:37:05,937 --> 00:37:08,275
- Dembe?
- No, Ressler. It's me.

620
00:37:08,306 --> 00:37:11,118
Keen? I'm sorry. We...

621
00:37:11,142 --> 00:37:12,987
We got here too late. Dom's gone.

622
00:37:13,011 --> 00:37:15,122
- I know.
- You do? How? Where are you?

623
00:37:15,146 --> 00:37:16,857
Why are you calling me
from Dembe's phone?

624
00:37:16,881 --> 00:37:19,226
Ressler, listen to me.
He's going to kill her.

625
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:20,961
Reddington's on his way
to kill my mother.

626
00:37:20,985 --> 00:37:22,496
- Hold on. Slow down.
- She's there now.

627
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,798
The park on Wabash and Grant.

628
00:37:23,822 --> 00:37:25,232
That's where he's gonna meet her.

629
00:37:25,256 --> 00:37:26,834
You got to send units there now.

630
00:37:26,858 --> 00:37:28,469
Done. But, Keen, you got to realize

631
00:37:28,493 --> 00:37:31,072
the best-case scenario here
is we arrest her.

632
00:37:31,096 --> 00:37:33,541
Then arrest her. Just get there. Now.

633
00:37:33,565 --> 00:37:36,043
- Where are you?
- I'm on my way, but I'm unarmed.

634
00:37:36,067 --> 00:37:38,031
You got to stop him.

635
00:37:38,703 --> 00:37:40,581
All those years searching for answers,

636
00:37:40,605 --> 00:37:42,983
and you were right
in front of me the whole time.

637
00:37:43,007 --> 00:37:44,785
For what it's worth, I didn't know

638
00:37:44,809 --> 00:37:47,254
what Dom was planning in Belgrade.

639
00:37:47,278 --> 00:37:48,856
I believe you.

640
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,660
But after... you let
the world believe the lie.

641
00:37:52,684 --> 00:37:54,862
You dangled me out there,

642
00:37:54,886 --> 00:37:58,217
let everyone think I had the Archive.

643
00:37:58,923 --> 00:38:00,768
And now I know why.

644
00:38:00,792 --> 00:38:02,470
Because if they were chasing me,

645
00:38:02,494 --> 00:38:04,932
it meant they weren't chasing you.

646
00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:06,841
It's not quite that simple.

647
00:38:06,865 --> 00:38:10,078
You're N-13, aren't you? You framed me.

648
00:38:10,102 --> 00:38:11,846
You fed me to Townsend as a patsy,

649
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:14,548
and Dominic knew and helped you do it.

650
00:38:14,572 --> 00:38:17,451
Sir. Sir, I just got off
the phone with Agent Ressler,

651
00:38:17,475 --> 00:38:19,120
and he's gonna do it. Mr. Reddington's

652
00:38:19,144 --> 00:38:20,554
- really gonna do it.
- Do what?

653
00:38:20,578 --> 00:38:22,289
He's gonna kill Agent Keen's mother.

654
00:38:22,313 --> 00:38:24,325
City Park. Wabash and Grant.
They're there now.

655
00:38:24,349 --> 00:38:25,648
Scramble units.

656
00:38:26,918 --> 00:38:29,082
I could've helped you

657
00:38:29,821 --> 00:38:32,293
the way I always have,

658
00:38:32,924 --> 00:38:35,369
kept you one step ahead.

659
00:38:35,393 --> 00:38:38,739
But staying safe wasn't enough.

660
00:38:38,763 --> 00:38:40,274
You needed answers.

661
00:38:40,298 --> 00:38:42,387
Well, now you have them.

662
00:38:43,101 --> 00:38:45,501
And now they've destroyed you.

663
00:38:46,671 --> 00:38:50,284
What if I promised never to tell
a soul what I've learned?

664
00:38:50,308 --> 00:38:53,439
Well, that would be
the last lie you ever told.

665
00:38:54,712 --> 00:38:56,991
You won't kill me.

666
00:38:57,015 --> 00:38:58,861
You can't.

667
00:38:59,728 --> 00:39:00,830
Why is that?

668
00:39:00,854 --> 00:39:02,196
Because Elizabeth
would never forgive you.

669
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:04,498
You don't know a damn thing
about Elizabeth.

670
00:39:04,522 --> 00:39:05,966
Oh, that's not true.

671
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:07,468
I've gotten to know her.

672
00:39:07,492 --> 00:39:10,571
She chose me. She's helping me.

673
00:39:10,595 --> 00:39:12,640
She has no idea who you are.

674
00:39:12,664 --> 00:39:15,376
Me? I'm her mother.

675
00:39:19,204 --> 00:39:23,451
And even now, there's love there.

676
00:39:32,951 --> 00:39:34,261
I can't let you leave.

677
00:39:36,087 --> 00:39:37,665
My God.

678
00:39:37,689 --> 00:39:40,968
I can't imagine what
this must be like for you,

679
00:39:40,992 --> 00:39:42,436
knowing you can't kill me

680
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:45,906
because of how much
Elizabeth loves her mother.

681
00:40:21,432 --> 00:40:24,144
You're never gonna get away with this!

682
00:40:26,504 --> 00:40:28,449
Red.

683
00:40:29,305 --> 00:41:29,575
