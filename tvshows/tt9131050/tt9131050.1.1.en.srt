2
00:01:21,342 --> 00:01:22,342
Babe...

3
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:26,475
They've called me in.

4
00:01:26,629 --> 00:01:27,768
Hm?

5
00:01:27,856 --> 00:01:29,686
- You said you didn't think they would.
- Mm.

6
00:01:29,836 --> 00:01:31,389
Sod's law.

7
00:01:31,838 --> 00:01:35,022
Go back to sleep.
I'll see you later.

8
00:02:32,024 --> 00:02:33,414
I'm sorry to bring you here,
mate,

9
00:02:33,502 --> 00:02:35,553
it's just I didn't want to bump into
anyone we knew.

10
00:02:35,641 --> 00:02:37,295
It's fine, Ray,
I wasn't doing anything.

11
00:02:37,383 --> 00:02:39,704
I'm SIO on duty this weekend.

12
00:02:39,845 --> 00:02:41,125
But it's all quiet.

13
00:02:41,617 --> 00:02:43,617
I'm fucked,
Steve.

14
00:02:44,442 --> 00:02:46,414
I don't know
what they're accusing me of.

15
00:02:46,587 --> 00:02:49,485
I don't even know
who's accusing me.

16
00:02:50,298 --> 00:02:52,233
I'm Deputy Chief Constable.

17
00:02:52,321 --> 00:02:54,329
I was up
for the Chief at Bedfordshire.

18
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:56,102
And now that's gone.
Everything's gone.

19
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,928
You must have some idea
what it's about.

20
00:03:03,017 --> 00:03:04,782
Some sort of sexual misconduct.

21
00:03:06,184 --> 00:03:09,125
Some women have come forward,
I think.

22
00:03:09,876 --> 00:03:11,266
It's embarrassing.

23
00:03:11,354 --> 00:03:13,454
It's bloody humiliating.

24
00:03:14,885 --> 00:03:17,618
I like women.
You know, I like chatting to them.

25
00:03:17,941 --> 00:03:20,204
- Bantering.
- Well, what can I say, mate?

26
00:03:20,292 --> 00:03:22,938
Other than,
it's not the '80s any more.

27
00:03:23,308 --> 00:03:25,922
Do you know
what one of the allegations is?

28
00:03:26,553 --> 00:03:29,110
I said to her,
"Big buttons."

29
00:03:29,324 --> 00:03:31,930
"Big buttons" cos, apparently,
she had prominent

30
00:03:32,157 --> 00:03:33,907
buttons on her blouse.

31
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:36,298
Even if I did say it,
I was just having a bit of a laugh.

32
00:03:36,385 --> 00:03:37,907
- That's all.
- Yeah,

33
00:03:38,016 --> 00:03:39,682
you probably shouldn't
say that stuff any more.

34
00:03:39,769 --> 00:03:41,769
Oh, big buttons?
Come on!

35
00:03:44,937 --> 00:03:46,422
Well, maybe not.

36
00:03:48,306 --> 00:03:50,626
Do you know how many statements
have been written about me?

37
00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:53,707
50!
That's what I've heard, 50!

38
00:03:53,864 --> 00:03:55,024
I mean, I...

39
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:57,903
I could always try
and clear my name.

40
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:59,891
But, you know,
it wouldn't make any difference.

41
00:04:00,171 --> 00:04:01,922
They'll have me by the legs.

42
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,112
- You know how it works.
- Ray...

43
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,113
Calm down.
You're being paranoid, mate.

44
00:04:06,201 --> 00:04:10,114
You have been in this job
a long time, right?

45
00:04:10,202 --> 00:04:13,993
You know how things are changing.
It's not just here, it's everywhere.

46
00:04:14,211 --> 00:04:17,003
They get a whiff of success,
and then they're suspicious.

47
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:18,696
They begrudge you.

48
00:04:18,822 --> 00:04:21,112
I'm telling you, it's brutal.

49
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,430
I don't get involved in any
of that bollocks. I just do the job.

50
00:04:24,518 --> 00:04:25,975
If they stay out of my way,
I'll stay

51
00:04:26,063 --> 00:04:28,338
- out of theirs.
- Oh, don't be so bloody naive!

52
00:04:33,426 --> 00:04:34,868
How's the family?

53
00:04:35,163 --> 00:04:37,313
I'm causing them nothing but pain,
Steve.

54
00:04:40,418 --> 00:04:41,975
It's my turn
to have the kids this week

55
00:04:42,063 --> 00:04:44,438
and I've got to pick them up
from their mum's, so...

56
00:04:48,143 --> 00:04:50,681
- All the best, mate.
- Yeah, you too, Ray. Take care.

57
00:05:18,087 --> 00:05:20,007
Well, we were hoping
to have the weekend away,

58
00:05:20,095 --> 00:05:21,468
but they've put him
on a flight.

59
00:05:21,556 --> 00:05:23,188
Always the same.

60
00:05:24,305 --> 00:05:25,743
Mm.

61
00:05:27,901 --> 00:05:31,055
Mm, if you can pick me up,
yeah.

62
00:05:31,821 --> 00:05:33,469
Ten's fine. Thanks, Mum.

63
00:05:33,581 --> 00:05:34,938
Oh...

64
00:05:35,681 --> 00:05:37,695
Mum, I've got to go, it's Liam.

65
00:05:41,133 --> 00:05:42,189
Hey, Liam.

66
00:05:42,277 --> 00:05:45,274
- <i>Have you heard from Sian this morning?</i>
- Sian? No.

67
00:05:45,377 --> 00:05:48,071
It's just that Kev says that
she didn't come home last night.

68
00:05:50,154 --> 00:05:52,415
Mm, she was out with her mates,
wasn't she?

69
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:55,884
Yeah, that's what he said.
But he just sounded a bit worried.

70
00:05:56,409 --> 00:05:58,866
She must have just stayed over
at somebody's.

71
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:01,306
- Yeah.
- Probably still asleep.

72
00:06:03,883 --> 00:06:06,882
So let's just get
the last spoon in.

73
00:06:07,174 --> 00:06:08,499
Oh...!

74
00:06:08,609 --> 00:06:11,017
We'll have to save that one
for Grandad, won't we?

75
00:06:11,136 --> 00:06:12,456
That's it.

76
00:06:13,869 --> 00:06:15,696
I'll put those in the oven.

77
00:06:15,784 --> 00:06:17,001
There we go.

78
00:06:17,089 --> 00:06:20,274
- Can I have one now?
- After they've cooled down, yes.

79
00:06:22,242 --> 00:06:25,509
Someone tried to break into
the bloody arcade again last night.

80
00:06:26,429 --> 00:06:27,702
What's the matter?

81
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:31,329
Oh, sorry. Just... I always
get like this round her birthday.

82
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:33,821
She'll come home this year.
Don't worry.

83
00:06:36,256 --> 00:06:37,954
Your Auntie Becky liked colouring in.

84
00:06:38,071 --> 00:06:39,228
Just like you, hey?

85
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:42,126
I'd better get down there.
It'll be all right, dear.

86
00:06:54,641 --> 00:06:55,759
Mum.

87
00:06:56,383 --> 00:07:00,407
- Have you rang Lora?
- Y <i>eah, she's not heard from he</i>r.

88
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,665
Kev said
the last time he heard from her

89
00:07:03,753 --> 00:07:05,939
was a text about one o'clock
in the morning or something.

90
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:08,519
- Ollie, turn that down.
- Yeah, sorry.

91
00:07:08,664 --> 00:07:11,134
And, erm,
now she's not answering her phone.

92
00:07:11,593 --> 00:07:13,313
Probably still hung over.

93
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,673
I've told her about this.

94
00:07:17,189 --> 00:07:19,688
Yeah, well, I popped round home,
but she wasn't there.

95
00:07:19,829 --> 00:07:21,828
Kev's started ringing round
all of her mates.

96
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:25,445
I'll be back soon.
Call me when you hear from her.

97
00:07:27,521 --> 00:07:29,195
She's still not turned up?

98
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:35,961
- Shall we stop for a coffee?
- No, Dennis.

99
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:37,844
I just want to get home,
please.

100
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:44,578
That's good.
That's nice, isn't it?

101
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:46,994
- Oh, they'll look lovely on there.
- Hello? Mum?

102
00:07:47,082 --> 00:07:48,671
In here!

103
00:07:50,555 --> 00:07:52,735
Me and Chelsea
are baking.

104
00:07:55,028 --> 00:07:56,945
Daddy, we've made cakes!

105
00:07:57,033 --> 00:07:58,462
Yeah, lovely.

106
00:07:58,550 --> 00:07:59,695
Mm!

107
00:07:59,783 --> 00:08:02,141
Come on, Mum. I've got something
I want to show you.

108
00:08:02,275 --> 00:08:03,810
- What?
- Well, get your coat on.

109
00:08:03,898 --> 00:08:05,288
It's only around the corner.

110
00:08:05,376 --> 00:08:07,376
Oh, I don't know...!

111
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:24,632
Mum, come on.

112
00:08:25,507 --> 00:08:27,582
- Get in.
- Where are the other little 'uns?

113
00:08:27,669 --> 00:08:29,129
My mum's got them.

114
00:08:57,231 --> 00:08:59,437
- What are you doing in here?
- Sorry.

115
00:08:59,657 --> 00:09:01,942
The back door was open.
We thought you were home.

116
00:09:02,978 --> 00:09:05,219
We're here because your daughter's
been reported missing.

117
00:09:05,398 --> 00:09:08,738
Reported what?
Who's reported her missing?

118
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,090
Er...

119
00:09:10,178 --> 00:09:11,582
Her partner.

120
00:09:11,899 --> 00:09:13,301
Kevin Reape.

121
00:09:15,448 --> 00:09:18,769
She'll just be round a friend's
somewhere, I'm sure of it.

122
00:09:20,049 --> 00:09:23,337
She went out last night
at Suju's in Old Town.

123
00:09:23,891 --> 00:09:25,390
Must have had
a late one.

124
00:09:25,618 --> 00:09:26,876
And she's just
having a lie-in.

125
00:09:26,964 --> 00:09:28,421
He was worried enough
to contact us,

126
00:09:28,509 --> 00:09:30,174
so we're just
doing the obvious things.

127
00:09:30,313 --> 00:09:32,697
She's clearly not at her own home
and she's not here.

128
00:09:33,003 --> 00:09:34,702
Can you think
where else she might be?

129
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,306
She'll be round a friend's somewhere.

130
00:09:37,852 --> 00:09:39,352
We, er...

131
00:09:39,861 --> 00:09:41,797
We need to do a ring round.

132
00:09:43,829 --> 00:09:45,582
I rung the police this morning
for advice.

133
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:47,750
They told me to ring the hospitals
first. I've done that.

134
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,796
I've rung her mates.
I've rung everyone.

135
00:09:50,354 --> 00:09:52,891
I spoke to Suzie, Nathalie and Beth,
who she was out with last night.

136
00:09:52,978 --> 00:09:54,922
- Why didn't she go with them?
- I don't know.

137
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:56,469
They said
she had a few drinks,

138
00:09:56,557 --> 00:09:58,953
got chatting to some people,
then they got separated.

139
00:09:59,211 --> 00:10:01,852
- When they left they couldn't find her.
- Who was she chatting to?

140
00:10:02,214 --> 00:10:05,367
They said this woman
and a tall fella with a shaved head.

141
00:10:08,887 --> 00:10:10,446
I can't even get my car out.

142
00:10:10,534 --> 00:10:12,374
I'm blocked in
and she's got her keys with her.

143
00:10:13,301 --> 00:10:15,055
Kevin, I need to ask you
a few questions.

144
00:10:15,264 --> 00:10:16,578
OK, no problem.

145
00:10:16,869 --> 00:10:19,125
No, just Kevin by himself.
Thanks.

146
00:10:19,213 --> 00:10:20,422
OK.

147
00:10:32,197 --> 00:10:33,453
- Hello?
- Mum?

148
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:35,586
- <i>Yeah. Have you heard from her?</i>
- No.

149
00:10:35,828 --> 00:10:37,563
- Not you either, then?
- No.

150
00:10:37,651 --> 00:10:40,797
- They're questioning Kev now.
- What do you mean, questioning?

151
00:10:40,969 --> 00:10:42,828
They've just taken him off
on his own.

152
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:46,109
They don't think he's got anything
to do with it, do they?

153
00:10:46,196 --> 00:10:47,500
They can't do. They...

154
00:10:47,588 --> 00:10:49,502
They're probably just asking him
who she might be with.

155
00:10:49,589 --> 00:10:52,391
But he can't think of anyone else.
He's rung everyone he knows.

156
00:10:52,523 --> 00:10:54,977
Bloody hell, Sian,
what are you playing at?

157

<font color=#FF00FF>*A CONFESSION*</font>
Episode Title: <font color=#FFFF00>"Episode #1.1"</font>

159
00:11:04,523 --> 00:11:05,796
Come on, come on.

160
00:11:05,891 --> 00:11:08,274
- A step.
- All right, all right.

161
00:11:08,362 --> 00:11:09,362
And another.

162
00:11:09,767 --> 00:11:11,539
- How many more?
- One more.

163
00:11:11,811 --> 00:11:13,867
That's it, that's it.

164
00:11:13,992 --> 00:11:15,914
- Stay there.
- Stay here?

165
00:11:16,002 --> 00:11:17,235
Yeah.

166
00:11:18,852 --> 00:11:20,469
And open them.

167
00:11:23,618 --> 00:11:24,985
We've just bought it.

168
00:11:25,363 --> 00:11:27,313
You are kidding me?!

169
00:11:27,863 --> 00:11:30,909
Now, we're gonna gut it
and completely refurbish everything.

170
00:11:30,997 --> 00:11:32,509
And we'll only be
five minutes from you.

171
00:11:32,596 --> 00:11:34,733
The kids can pop in and see Grandma
all the time!

172
00:11:34,821 --> 00:11:36,914
Oh, how wonderful!

173
00:11:37,055 --> 00:11:40,183
Oh, you know me and Charlie
will help you all we can.

174
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:41,446
You know we will.

175
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,533
Oh, look at this!

176
00:11:43,863 --> 00:11:47,633
Oh, my goodness,
that's gorgeous, that fireplace.

177
00:11:48,201 --> 00:11:49,445
Are you happy?

178
00:11:50,469 --> 00:11:51,633
Mum...

179
00:11:51,922 --> 00:11:54,531
Oh, this is just another thing
your father'll kick off about,

180
00:11:54,789 --> 00:11:56,789
you moving closer to me
and Charlie.

181
00:11:56,877 --> 00:11:59,474
He'll say it's my doing,
taking the grandkids away from him.

182
00:11:59,562 --> 00:12:02,227
He can get stuffed.
I don't want the kids seeing him.

183
00:12:02,315 --> 00:12:03,609
But I have to keep
things civil, don't I?

184
00:12:03,696 --> 00:12:06,087
I mean, what if Becky gets in touch
again with anyone from his family?

185
00:12:06,174 --> 00:12:08,400
I want them
to at least let me know.

186
00:12:08,488 --> 00:12:10,266
Mum, when she does turn up again,

187
00:12:10,414 --> 00:12:12,546
it'll be you she'll want to see
and only you.

188
00:12:12,696 --> 00:12:14,320
She'll be home
this year.

189
00:12:14,476 --> 00:12:17,084
She'll be back for her birthday, Steven.
I'm sure of it.

190
00:12:17,172 --> 00:12:19,326
Oh, this is just...
It's...

191
00:12:19,414 --> 00:12:20,653
Look at this!

192
00:12:21,038 --> 00:12:22,978
Have you got your own room?

193
00:12:33,197 --> 00:12:34,490
Mick!

194
00:12:34,624 --> 00:12:36,349
Mick, telephone!

195
00:12:39,836 --> 00:12:42,675
Hello, Elaine. It's Debbie.
He's just coming.

196
00:12:42,763 --> 00:12:44,014
Who is it?

197
00:12:46,115 --> 00:12:47,869
Hello?

198
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,280
Since when?

199
00:12:53,546 --> 00:12:55,748
No. No, I've not heard nothing
from her.

200
00:12:56,238 --> 00:12:58,118
Yeah, well, she'll be round
a mate's, won't she?

201
00:12:58,205 --> 00:12:59,521
Yeah, all right.

202
00:12:59,672 --> 00:13:01,224
Yeah, well,
let me know soon as, yeah?

203
00:13:01,312 --> 00:13:02,852
Yeah, bye. Bye.

204
00:13:03,881 --> 00:13:05,922
You haven't got to take him home early,
have you?

205
00:13:06,009 --> 00:13:07,146
No, it's nothing like that.

206
00:13:07,234 --> 00:13:08,756
Come on, Dad!

207
00:13:11,226 --> 00:13:13,045
Sian's not come home.

208
00:13:18,979 --> 00:13:20,658
She's out with her mates.

209
00:13:20,901 --> 00:13:22,933
Erm, I'm out with mine,
at Cheltenham races.

210
00:13:23,241 --> 00:13:24,401
We're swapping texts all day.

211
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:28,718
Erm, and I get back to Swindon
about 11:30.

212
00:13:28,829 --> 00:13:30,213
And I'd been drinking all day.

213
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,742
I tell her I just don't fancy going out.

214
00:13:31,829 --> 00:13:33,361
I'm done.

215
00:13:33,449 --> 00:13:35,781
Then she texts me
about 1:20

216
00:13:35,869 --> 00:13:37,533
in the morning, saying,
"Where are you?"

217
00:13:37,621 --> 00:13:39,369
- But by that time I was asleep.
- OK.

218
00:13:39,457 --> 00:13:41,682
And you don't
respond until 3:24am?

219
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:42,535
Yeah.

220
00:13:42,623 --> 00:13:44,663
I woke up and she weren't there.
I checked my phone.

221
00:13:44,829 --> 00:13:47,828
And that's when I replied, saying
I was at home and waiting for her.

222
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:49,908
OK. And did you go back
to sleep, then?

223
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:52,481
No. It didn't matter how knackered
I was, I couldn't sleep.

224
00:13:52,569 --> 00:13:54,110
I kept waiting and waiting.

225
00:13:54,198 --> 00:13:57,351
About 4:30, I send another text
just saying, "Worried."

226
00:13:57,439 --> 00:14:00,278
And I put a kiss on it.
But she never replied.

227
00:14:00,935 --> 00:14:02,257
OK.

228
00:14:04,912 --> 00:14:07,974
She got into a bit of trouble
with money a while back,

229
00:14:08,062 --> 00:14:09,667
credit cards and that.

230
00:14:10,352 --> 00:14:11,631
I laid into her
about it.

231
00:14:11,719 --> 00:14:13,849
But nothing
she'd go running off over.

232
00:14:14,343 --> 00:14:16,256
- And what about your partner?
- Pete?

233
00:14:16,374 --> 00:14:17,630
Yes.

234
00:14:18,568 --> 00:14:20,139
How does
she get along with him?

235
00:14:21,732 --> 00:14:22,856
Fine.

236
00:14:22,982 --> 00:14:25,041
If you think back,
do you have any suspicions

237
00:14:25,129 --> 00:14:26,748
about
Sian's recent behaviour?

238
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,585
Suspicions?

239
00:14:28,965 --> 00:14:31,248
Texting a lot,
phone calls at strange times,

240
00:14:31,336 --> 00:14:34,491
or being guarded about
you having access to her phone.

241
00:14:34,579 --> 00:14:36,352
You think
she's got another fella?

242
00:14:52,061 --> 00:14:53,413
Oh, come on!

243
00:14:53,501 --> 00:14:54,639
Really?

244
00:15:00,578 --> 00:15:02,069
Steve Fulcher.

245
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:09,038
Have you spoken to
the boyfriend?

246
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:12,110
Mm-hm.

247
00:15:12,942 --> 00:15:14,602
Tried the hospitals?

248
00:15:17,265 --> 00:15:19,592
OK, right, yeah. I'll be right in.
Thanks.

249
00:15:31,406 --> 00:15:32,967
Next one on the stairs.

250
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:35,655
- That's her.
- And what's the time?

251
00:15:35,756 --> 00:15:37,233
2:52.

252
00:15:37,461 --> 00:15:39,796
It's about an hour
after she's texted the boyfriend.

253
00:15:41,108 --> 00:15:42,616
Camera at the bottom of the stairs.

254
00:15:42,829 --> 00:15:45,067
Oh, it's definitely her,
the clothes are a match.

255
00:15:45,334 --> 00:15:47,593
- This is through the foyer.
- Mm-hm.

256
00:15:48,172 --> 00:15:49,592
Oh, play that again.

257
00:15:49,983 --> 00:15:50,953
No.

258
00:15:51,064 --> 00:15:53,202
Not interested in each other.

259
00:15:54,904 --> 00:15:56,155
The front door.

260
00:15:57,492 --> 00:15:59,172
And finally, outside.

261
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,897
And it looks like she's going left,

262
00:16:01,985 --> 00:16:04,733
which is in the direction of the
home she shares with Kevin Reape.

263
00:16:04,974 --> 00:16:07,124
- Mm. How far away?
- About half a mile.

264
00:16:07,374 --> 00:16:08,999
No-one comes out after her,
follows her?

265
00:16:09,087 --> 00:16:10,009
No.

266
00:16:10,097 --> 00:16:11,546
She's a family girl.

267
00:16:11,829 --> 00:16:13,109
And they can't think of a reason

268
00:16:13,202 --> 00:16:15,272
why she'd be out of contact
for this long.

269
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,600
Hm.

270
00:16:22,237 --> 00:16:24,124
The cell site tells us
her mobile was pinging

271
00:16:24,212 --> 00:16:27,092
all Friday night and early Saturday
morning in Swindon Old Town,

272
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:29,350
which is what we'd expect
from someone in Suju's.

273
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:31,491
She leaves the club at 2:52

274
00:16:31,579 --> 00:16:33,819
and her home is no more
than 15 minutes away.

275
00:16:33,975 --> 00:16:37,147
But at 3:24, half an hour
after she's left Suju's,

276
00:16:37,235 --> 00:16:39,512
her phone signal bounces off
the Cadley mast,

277
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,513
which is roughly 14 miles
in the opposite direction,

278
00:16:42,601 --> 00:16:44,022
in the middle of
Savernake Forest.

279
00:16:44,117 --> 00:16:45,370
No response from her.

280
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:48,866
Right, so the only way that Sian,
or her phone

281
00:16:48,954 --> 00:16:50,917
if she's accidentally
left it with someone,

282
00:16:51,005 --> 00:16:53,444
can travel 14 miles in half an hour,
is by car.

283
00:16:53,547 --> 00:16:54,991
Mm, yeah.

284
00:16:55,093 --> 00:16:56,905
The phone kept pinging off
the Cadley mast

285
00:16:57,008 --> 00:17:00,366
right up until 2:30 this afternoon,
when we presume the battery died.

286
00:17:00,688 --> 00:17:02,335
We do have
a defined search area.

287
00:17:02,423 --> 00:17:05,336
Unfortunately, the radius is 6.7 miles.

288
00:17:05,476 --> 00:17:07,389
- Can't we triangulate?
- No.

289
00:17:07,477 --> 00:17:09,210
There is only one mast up there.

290
00:17:11,547 --> 00:17:12,776
Right, I want the dogs out.

291
00:17:12,864 --> 00:17:15,901
I want a search
initially concentrated on

292
00:17:15,989 --> 00:17:18,828
the entrances and exits
to Savernake Forest.

293
00:17:19,054 --> 00:17:20,684
I want the route from Suju's

294
00:17:20,772 --> 00:17:23,036
all the way to Sian's address
searched again,

295
00:17:23,124 --> 00:17:27,385
concentrating on ditches, alleyways,
anywhere she may have crawled

296
00:17:27,473 --> 00:17:29,386
if she was involved
in a traffic accident.

297
00:17:29,474 --> 00:17:31,442
I want a house-to-house
along the route,

298
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:33,473
not forgetting
sheds and outhouses.

299
00:17:33,613 --> 00:17:36,965
I want these posters put up...

300
00:17:37,437 --> 00:17:38,653
...tonight.

301
00:17:38,741 --> 00:17:40,692
Sorry, I've got to take this.
Yes, sir?

302
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,808
<i>I've heard you want to send
a force helicopter up.</i>

303
00:17:43,021 --> 00:17:45,879
That's right, sir.
Yes, I do.

304
00:17:47,079 --> 00:17:49,950
£1,500 just to switch
the bloody engine on.

305
00:17:50,272 --> 00:17:51,950
She's been missing
for less than 24 hours.

306
00:17:52,038 --> 00:17:53,402
<i>Are you sure this
isn't just a misper?</i>

307
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:55,338
Frankly, no, I'm not.
It's possible

308
00:17:55,426 --> 00:17:57,049
that she could be
round a friend's house

309
00:17:57,137 --> 00:17:59,536
or wants to dump her boyfriend
but can't face him.

310
00:17:59,632 --> 00:18:02,536
But, no, it doesn't fit.
Have you read her background?

311
00:18:03,237 --> 00:18:05,971
- Yeah, fair enough.
- I want to work on the basis

312
00:18:06,059 --> 00:18:08,459
she's still alive,
being held against her will.

313
00:18:08,644 --> 00:18:10,152
You know, a crime in action.

314
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,528
We're on to this early, sir.

315
00:18:11,616 --> 00:18:13,616
If we go big and go quick,
we could save her.

316
00:18:14,829 --> 00:18:16,815
- OK, press the button.
- Thank you.

317
00:18:16,903 --> 00:18:19,179
Sir, one more thing.
<i>I don't want to speak out of turn,</i>

318
00:18:19,267 --> 00:18:21,450
<i>but I saw Ray Haywood today,
just for a coffee.</i>

319
00:18:21,538 --> 00:18:22,782
All right, how was he?

320
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:24,512
To be honest, he looked terrible.

321
00:18:24,657 --> 00:18:27,530
He feels as if the investigation
into him is excessive.

322
00:18:27,657 --> 00:18:30,057
It's a disciplinary matter.
OK, I'll see what I can do.

323
00:18:30,145 --> 00:18:32,901
But <i>due process must be followed.
It's largely out of my hands.</i>

324
00:18:32,989 --> 00:18:34,418
No. I'm just passing it on.

325
00:18:34,506 --> 00:18:35,700
- Yeah, noted.
- <i>OK.</i>

326
00:18:35,851 --> 00:18:37,410
Thank you.

327
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:49,429
Jackie.

328
00:18:50,689 --> 00:18:51,908
"Any news?"

329
00:18:52,237 --> 00:18:54,832
Does she think we'd be keeping it
to ourselves if there was?

330
00:18:55,853 --> 00:18:57,317
She's only asking.

331
00:18:59,281 --> 00:19:01,403
Pete keeps ringing, saying,
"Don't lose hope."

332
00:19:01,578 --> 00:19:03,231
Well, don't, then.

333
00:19:05,252 --> 00:19:07,356
I cannot think of
any logical reason

334
00:19:07,444 --> 00:19:09,807
why she would have been out of
contact with all of us

335
00:19:09,895 --> 00:19:11,387
for this long.

336
00:19:14,196 --> 00:19:16,731
- This is going to be bad.
- Shut up, will you!

337
00:19:17,139 --> 00:19:18,731
Wherever she is, it's against her will.

338
00:19:18,819 --> 00:19:21,387
And when we get her back,
she won't be the same Sian.

339
00:19:25,829 --> 00:19:28,376
Zero Kilo Nine, what's your position?

340
00:19:28,731 --> 00:19:30,742
800 feet above Savernake Forest.

341
00:19:30,829 --> 00:19:32,895
Three miles
south-east of Marlborough.

342
00:19:51,699 --> 00:19:54,004
Thermal images are a negative.

343
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,543
Ground team, stand by.

344
00:20:04,215 --> 00:20:06,215
Thermal visual confirmed.

345
00:20:06,849 --> 00:20:08,168
I'm getting two live bodies,

346
00:20:08,256 --> 00:20:10,426
about 50 yards north-west
of your position.

347
00:20:10,907 --> 00:20:13,095
Keep on that course
you're on now.

348
00:20:21,626 --> 00:20:23,539
Hello? It's the police.

349
00:20:23,829 --> 00:20:25,829
Can you come out now?

350
00:20:32,829 --> 00:20:35,029
Right, stand there, please.

351
00:20:36,829 --> 00:20:39,386
It was just a couple out camping.
They got the shock of their lives.

352
00:20:39,473 --> 00:20:40,932
Camping?
A bit bloody cold, isn't it?

353
00:20:41,085 --> 00:20:43,452
There's some stuff online
about a search for Sian.

354
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,260
And they said
they wanted to be there early.

355
00:20:45,905 --> 00:20:48,398
- A search?
- Just local people, I think.

356
00:20:48,829 --> 00:20:50,979
Boss, there's an ANPR camera

357
00:20:51,067 --> 00:20:53,416
covering the main route
between Old Town and Savernake.

358
00:20:53,504 --> 00:20:55,164
We should have a list
of index numbers by the morning.

359
00:20:55,251 --> 00:20:58,421
OK. Concentrate
between 2:52 and 3:24.

360
00:20:58,516 --> 00:21:00,447
- Already done.
- Thanks a lot.

361
00:21:02,734 --> 00:21:04,257
Jesus.

362
00:22:17,234 --> 00:22:18,758
Steve Fulcher.

363
00:22:19,341 --> 00:22:21,514
Boss, I hope
you don't mind me calling.

364
00:22:21,656 --> 00:22:23,758
- You said any time.
- Yeah, but not at night.

365
00:22:23,846 --> 00:22:26,969
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- I'm taking the piss. What have you got?

366
00:22:27,829 --> 00:22:30,195
We've done the run from Old Town
out to Savernake Forest.

367
00:22:30,283 --> 00:22:32,283
The average journey time's
25 minutes.

368
00:22:33,782 --> 00:22:35,742
OK, so...

369
00:22:36,407 --> 00:22:38,272
...if she gets to Savernake at 3:24,

370
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,977
it means she left Old Town at, say, 3...

371
00:22:41,492 --> 00:22:45,405
Er, we know she left Suju's at 2:52,
which gives us...

372
00:22:45,633 --> 00:22:46,850
eight minutes...

373
00:22:46,992 --> 00:22:48,352
unaccounted for.

374
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,703
Whatever happened
between her leaving the club,

375
00:22:50,791 --> 00:22:52,719
and her or just her phone...

376
00:22:52,807 --> 00:22:55,320
leaving for the ride
to Savernake Forest,

377
00:22:55,829 --> 00:22:57,828
happened in those
eight minutes, right?

378
00:22:58,038 --> 00:22:59,491
Narrows it down a bit, sir.

379
00:22:59,944 --> 00:23:01,211
Mm. Yes, it does.

380
00:23:01,299 --> 00:23:02,779
Well done. Thank you.

381
00:23:16,051 --> 00:23:17,551
Hello?

382
00:23:18,617 --> 00:23:19,531
Pete?

383
00:23:19,672 --> 00:23:21,430
No, no news.

384
00:23:21,518 --> 00:23:22,791
Oh, shit.

385
00:23:23,087 --> 00:23:25,640
Well, there could still be
any number of explanations.

386
00:23:25,797 --> 00:23:27,133
No, there can't, Pete.

387
00:23:27,221 --> 00:23:29,367
Nothing makes sense,
other than someone's got her.

388
00:23:29,455 --> 00:23:31,305
So let's just keep it real,
please.

389
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:39,367
We've been asked
to do a press conference.

390
00:23:40,451 --> 00:23:42,450
All sat there,
begging for her life.

391
00:23:42,768 --> 00:23:44,261
You've got to do it.

392
00:23:44,465 --> 00:23:45,758
I know.

393
00:23:47,892 --> 00:23:49,586
You have to get the message out
she's missing.

394
00:23:49,673 --> 00:23:51,013
I know.

395
00:23:51,218 --> 00:23:53,218
We have to be that
terrified family.

396
00:23:55,547 --> 00:23:57,969
Maybe one of us
will cry, on cue.

397
00:24:16,741 --> 00:24:19,367
What have you lit that for?
The neighbours'll go mad,

398
00:24:19,455 --> 00:24:20,942
all that smoke over
their washing.

399
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:23,641
You're mistaking me
for someone who gives a monkeys.

400
00:24:25,648 --> 00:24:27,305
What do you think?

401
00:24:27,649 --> 00:24:29,047
Yeah.

402
00:24:29,728 --> 00:24:31,508
I think she'll love it.

403
00:24:32,956 --> 00:24:35,110
Yeah, I can see
Becky in that.

404
00:24:36,547 --> 00:24:38,438
<i>..conducting inch-by-inch searches</i>

405
00:24:38,526 --> 00:24:40,149
<i>in locations in Swindon today,</i>

406
00:24:40,221 --> 00:24:42,576
<i>trying to establish
what happened to Sian O'Callaghan,</i>

407
00:24:42,664 --> 00:24:45,097
<i>who went missing in the early hours
of Saturday morning.</i>

408
00:24:45,185 --> 00:24:46,240
Oh, God, Charlie, look!

409
00:24:46,328 --> 00:24:47,821
An incident room has been set up
outside

410
00:24:47,908 --> 00:24:49,510
- Suji's nightclub...
- They're looking for that young girl.

411
00:24:49,597 --> 00:24:50,690
<i>...where she was last seen alive,</i>

412
00:24:50,777 --> 00:24:52,041
<i>in the hope of jogging
someone's memory.</i>

413
00:24:52,128 --> 00:24:55,978
I think, I've see..
I think I've seen her, you know?

414
00:24:56,657 --> 00:24:57,861
I've got a feeling.

415
00:24:57,962 --> 00:25:00,595
It's her mum
who's moved in with Pete the pilot.

416
00:25:18,821 --> 00:25:21,267
- Other people on their way, Steve.
- Thank you.

417
00:25:21,431 --> 00:25:22,562
Pass that round.

418
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:23,954
Oh, here they are.

419
00:25:25,561 --> 00:25:28,282
- Are you the last one?
- Thank you, sir.

420
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:30,101
Right, guys.

421
00:25:30,189 --> 00:25:31,742
Thank you, folks.

422
00:25:31,899 --> 00:25:34,166
Now, a few new faces.

423
00:25:34,458 --> 00:25:37,259
Steve Kirby will be Deputy SIO.

424
00:25:37,347 --> 00:25:39,305
Debs Peach, I think you all know.

425
00:25:39,393 --> 00:25:40,718
She'll be my scribe.

426
00:25:40,806 --> 00:25:43,827
Now, the search at Savernake Forest
is underway.

427
00:25:43,915 --> 00:25:47,742
Obviously, it's a huge area,
so it will be a slow process.

428
00:25:47,829 --> 00:25:49,696
Erm, who's first?

429
00:25:49,829 --> 00:25:53,915
Yeah, a couple of things
from Suju's last night.

430
00:25:54,003 --> 00:25:57,509
Er, several people report seeing
Sian in the toilet with a female,

431
00:25:57,597 --> 00:26:00,337
who was behaving possessively
towards her.

432
00:26:00,425 --> 00:26:02,338
Apparently, this girl is a lesbian.

433
00:26:02,441 --> 00:26:06,319
And Sian was also seen
in the smoking area with her,

434
00:26:06,407 --> 00:26:07,858
where cannabis was being smoked.

435
00:26:07,946 --> 00:26:12,775
And the DJ on Friday night,
a guy called Lenny Banyard...

436
00:26:12,863 --> 00:26:13,870
This is him.

437
00:26:13,958 --> 00:26:18,049
...has since posted on Facebook
that he is "suicidal".

438
00:26:18,137 --> 00:26:21,093
- Could this be guilt?
- He must be the tall, shaven-headed guy

439
00:26:21,181 --> 00:26:22,587
Sian was seen talking to.

440
00:26:22,675 --> 00:26:24,588
Lenny Banyard's tall
and shaven-headed.

441
00:26:24,829 --> 00:26:26,571
And feeling suicidal, apparently.

442
00:26:26,829 --> 00:26:28,954
What about ANPR?

443
00:26:29,065 --> 00:26:30,337
Yeah.
Er,

444
00:26:30,439 --> 00:26:32,397
14 vehicles
passed the fixed camera point

445
00:26:32,485 --> 00:26:34,978
between Swindon Old Town
and Savernake

446
00:26:35,066 --> 00:26:37,321
between 2:52 and 3:24.

447
00:26:37,416 --> 00:26:38,814
They're all being TI'd.

448
00:26:38,992 --> 00:26:42,493
Er, we seized all the CCTV
from the High Street?

449
00:26:42,581 --> 00:26:44,166
Yep, that's either done
or being done.

450
00:26:44,254 --> 00:26:45,704
Oh, and taxi firms.

451
00:26:45,829 --> 00:26:47,345
Don't forget taxi firms.

452
00:26:47,477 --> 00:26:50,634
Sian did have at least one
serious ex-boyfriend before Kevin,

453
00:26:50,722 --> 00:26:53,095
- a guy called Max Evershed.
- Mm-hm.

454
00:26:53,183 --> 00:26:55,650
Her mum wasn't entirely sure
why they ever broke up.

455
00:27:30,001 --> 00:27:31,782
This doesn't appear to be working.

456
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:34,978
Deputy Chief Constable Ray Hayward.

457
00:27:36,712 --> 00:27:38,884
Your pass has been disabled, sir.

458
00:27:41,672 --> 00:27:43,585
But I've got a meeting with HR.

459
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:45,532
I'm sorry, sir,
but there's a note here

460
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:47,673
that you need to be escorted
into the building.

461
00:27:47,761 --> 00:27:49,441
I can let them know
you're here.

462
00:27:50,158 --> 00:27:51,509
OK, thanks.

463
00:28:03,594 --> 00:28:06,126
Thanks. Thank you, darling.

464
00:28:06,214 --> 00:28:09,056
I think you look really good
in that. It suits you.

465
00:28:11,978 --> 00:28:13,470
Hello, John.

466
00:28:13,829 --> 00:28:15,204
Karen.

467
00:28:16,289 --> 00:28:18,150
Have you been spending
Charlie's money?

468
00:28:18,829 --> 00:28:21,486
I'm just going in the butcher's.
I'll see you in the car.

469
00:28:22,954 --> 00:28:25,400
So, how are you, how's everyone?
I haven't seen you in ages.

470
00:28:25,511 --> 00:28:27,259
I ain't complaining.

471
00:28:28,188 --> 00:28:30,586
- Dad ain't been too well.
- Sorry to hear that.

472
00:28:31,417 --> 00:28:32,782
How's Steven?

473
00:28:33,626 --> 00:28:35,188
I never get to see him
much no more.

474
00:28:35,276 --> 00:28:36,692
Them grandchildren are mine too,
you know?

475
00:28:36,779 --> 00:28:38,272
Steven's a grown man.
I can't control

476
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,311
what he does or
doesn't do.

477
00:28:39,406 --> 00:28:43,157
Oh, aye. Probably best
he keeps you and Charlie sweet.

478
00:28:43,664 --> 00:28:45,430
Why jump off
the gravy train, eh?

479
00:28:45,518 --> 00:28:47,704
It's Becky's birthday soon.
Have you seen her at all?

480
00:28:47,792 --> 00:28:49,071
No. Dad seen her that time.

481
00:28:49,159 --> 00:28:52,139
She gave him a cuddle,
he said, "Hello, Loogie Pooge."

482
00:28:52,227 --> 00:28:54,829
You told me about that.
So, has anyone seen her since?

483
00:28:56,305 --> 00:28:58,633
- Dad said my nephew see her.
- When?

484
00:28:59,221 --> 00:29:03,183
He said he was down in Bristol
and she gave him a large wad of cash

485
00:29:03,278 --> 00:29:05,959
cos she said she was earning
good money running some nightclub.

486
00:29:06,047 --> 00:29:07,813
- Running a nightclub?
- With her boyfriend.

487
00:29:07,901 --> 00:29:09,407
What nightclub?

488
00:29:10,212 --> 00:29:13,102
I don't know.
It was a good while back now.

489
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:14,488
So why didn't you tell me?

490
00:29:14,578 --> 00:29:15,873
I wasn't aware I had to.

491
00:29:15,961 --> 00:29:18,836
Well, it's important!
Cos I haven't see her for so long.

492
00:29:19,177 --> 00:29:20,399
Well...

493
00:29:22,391 --> 00:29:24,727
...at least she don't forget
my side of the family.

494
00:29:25,521 --> 00:29:28,001
Anyway, I'd better be going
before the shops shut.

495
00:29:29,011 --> 00:29:31,719
John, let me know
f you hear from her.

496
00:29:32,532 --> 00:29:34,313
Please.

497
00:29:42,586 --> 00:29:44,094
That was the plan.

498
00:29:45,547 --> 00:29:47,460
Well, how many are there?

499
00:29:47,829 --> 00:29:50,485
There's dozens of them.

500
00:29:50,573 --> 00:29:52,297
At least 50, I'd say.

501
00:29:52,829 --> 00:29:54,930
It's gone wild on social media.

502
00:29:57,553 --> 00:29:58,742
Well, let them help.

503
00:29:58,969 --> 00:30:00,485
- What?
- Let them help.

504
00:30:00,573 --> 00:30:02,733
It'll take us weeks
to cover that area on our own

505
00:30:02,821 --> 00:30:04,305
and we won't have the time.
So let them help.

506
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:05,879
OK, I've got to go.

507
00:30:08,524 --> 00:30:09,957
He says let them help.

508
00:30:10,129 --> 00:30:11,609
OK.

509
00:30:13,492 --> 00:30:15,469
Right, ladies and gents,
listen up.

510
00:30:15,557 --> 00:30:18,203
OK, gather round.
We're gonna be giving you a briefing.

511
00:30:18,291 --> 00:30:20,202
We're gonna take you through
in groups,

512
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:22,153
cos there's a lot of you here.

513
00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:24,679
Were you jealous of
Max Evershed?

514
00:30:26,829 --> 00:30:29,537
She told me about him,
but she finished with him before we met.

515
00:30:29,625 --> 00:30:32,451
- Was she still in contact with him?
- I don't think so.

516
00:30:32,571 --> 00:30:34,234
Did her relationship
with him annoy you?

517
00:30:34,352 --> 00:30:36,715
I couldn't give a monkey's about him.
I never met the guy.

518
00:30:37,029 --> 00:30:40,829
I hope she's cheating on me
with him right now, to tell the truth.

519
00:30:41,117 --> 00:30:43,902
All I can tell you is me and Sian
have something good

520
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:46,409
- and we trust each other.
- Mm-hm.

521
00:30:46,957 --> 00:30:48,796
Do you think Max
has got something to do with this?

522
00:30:48,883 --> 00:30:50,740
Well, I don't know.
We'll talk to him.

523
00:30:53,406 --> 00:30:56,545
Did she ever have any relationships
with other women?

524
00:30:56,828 --> 00:30:58,373
Relationships?
What do you mean?

525
00:30:58,762 --> 00:31:03,740
Well, she was seen talking
intimately with a girl at Suju's,

526
00:31:03,829 --> 00:31:06,662
- spending a lot of time with her.
- Are you taking the piss?

527
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:08,241
- Sian's not a lesbian.
- I have to ask.

528
00:31:08,328 --> 00:31:10,747
I've got to go down every avenue
and I can't sugar-coat things.

529
00:31:10,834 --> 00:31:13,076
I have to have the answers now.

530
00:31:13,261 --> 00:31:16,342
She's not a lesbian
and I don't know where she is.

531
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:17,678
All right.

532
00:31:20,344 --> 00:31:22,741
Look, take my phone.

533
00:31:22,829 --> 00:31:24,186
Check it.

534
00:31:24,289 --> 00:31:27,522
I know how this works. Check
the house as well. I want you to.

535
00:31:27,829 --> 00:31:29,959
I am worried
about Sian.

536
00:31:32,485 --> 00:31:35,154
I'll be honest,
I am fucking terrified.

537
00:31:39,601 --> 00:31:42,873
Well, I'm happy with him,
he's definitely not involved.

538
00:31:42,998 --> 00:31:44,829
Mm-hm. Agreed.

539
00:31:46,149 --> 00:31:47,954
..<i>scouring the undergrowth,
searching for any clues</i>

540
00:31:48,041 --> 00:31:49,601
<i>that might lead to
Sian O'Callaghan.</i>

541
00:31:49,968 --> 00:31:51,718
<i>More than 100 people turned out</i>

542
00:31:51,843 --> 00:31:53,601
<i>in Savernake Forest,
near Marlborough,</i>

543
00:31:53,689 --> 00:31:56,025
<i>to help in search for
the 22-year-old.</i>

544
00:31:56,267 --> 00:31:57,903
<i>In groups of ten or 15,</i>

545
00:31:57,991 --> 00:32:00,844
<i>they were assigned a police officer
to lead the way.</i>

546
00:32:01,664 --> 00:32:04,067
<i>The search is centred here
at Savernake Forest,</i>

547
00:32:04,155 --> 00:32:07,742
because this is the place Sian's
mobile phone last received a signal

548
00:32:07,829 --> 00:32:10,108
in the early hours of
Saturday morning.

549
00:32:18,178 --> 00:32:19,741
The reason I'm here, Mr Barlow,

550
00:32:19,829 --> 00:32:23,208
is because your car was picked up
by an ANPR roadside camera

551
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:24,903
in the early hours of Saturday morning,

552
00:32:24,991 --> 00:32:26,829
headed towards Savernake Forest.

553
00:32:27,006 --> 00:32:29,005
Do you remember
where you were going?

554
00:32:30,081 --> 00:32:31,601
Er...

555
00:32:32,234 --> 00:32:33,897
I remember I was pretty bored.

556
00:32:34,907 --> 00:32:36,907
So you went for a drive?

557
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,217
Yeah.

558
00:32:39,578 --> 00:32:40,796
What reason?

559
00:32:41,617 --> 00:32:43,038
Monster Munch.

560
00:32:44,523 --> 00:32:45,959
Monster Munch?

561
00:32:46,249 --> 00:32:47,600
I just fancied some.

562
00:32:47,704 --> 00:32:49,047
Pickled onion flavour.

563
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:51,370
I know they do them
at the all-night garage there.

564
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:55,007
So you're telling me that,
at three o'clock in the morning,

565
00:32:55,095 --> 00:32:57,563
you drive for 40 minutes
to Swindon Old Town,

566
00:32:57,828 --> 00:32:59,569
and 40 minutes back,

567
00:33:00,196 --> 00:33:02,124
just to get some Monster Munch?

568
00:33:03,828 --> 00:33:04,975
Yeah.

569
00:33:05,741 --> 00:33:08,296
- I didn't know you went out.
- Well, I did, Mother!

570
00:33:08,563 --> 00:33:10,403
This doesn't need you
putting your oar in!

571
00:33:15,562 --> 00:33:17,772
The house is in the middle
of Savernake Forest?

572
00:33:18,633 --> 00:33:19,853
Yeah, a little cottage.

573
00:33:19,941 --> 00:33:21,217
The bloke's in his 50s.

574
00:33:21,336 --> 00:33:23,537
<i>He lives with his mother.
I'm not happy with him, boss.</i>

575
00:33:23,625 --> 00:33:25,671
- Monster Munch...!
- <i>Right, we need a search warrant.</i>

576
00:33:25,758 --> 00:33:28,758
We need to seize his car.
Stay with him, Bob. Keep an eye on him.

577
00:33:34,601 --> 00:33:36,232
Lora's home from university.

578
00:33:36,569 --> 00:33:38,329
I know.
Isn't it great?

579
00:33:38,903 --> 00:33:40,811
Dad picked me up from the station.

580
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:44,061
- Mum, what's happening?
- Come on, love, none of that.

581
00:33:44,195 --> 00:33:45,625
Is this about Sian?

582
00:33:46,069 --> 00:33:48,374
I, er, I told him
she hadn't come home.

583
00:33:49,742 --> 00:33:51,290
- Come in the kitchen a minute, love.
- Why?

584
00:33:51,377 --> 00:33:55,085
Come in here. It's OK, you haven't
done anything wrong. It's just...

585
00:33:56,089 --> 00:33:57,958
Just, we're getting a bit worried
about Sian,

586
00:33:58,046 --> 00:33:59,256
cos we don't know
where she is.

587
00:33:59,344 --> 00:34:01,257
Can't you just call her
on her mobile?

588
00:34:01,345 --> 00:34:03,027
We've tried that
but she isn't answering.

589
00:34:03,218 --> 00:34:04,733
Where is she, then?

590
00:34:07,703 --> 00:34:11,366
We've asked the police to help find her,
so they're out looking for her.

591
00:34:11,524 --> 00:34:13,437
They'll find her, won't they, Mum?

592
00:34:13,585 --> 00:34:14,780
I hope so.

593
00:34:14,883 --> 00:34:16,402
- They will.
- Mm.

594
00:34:49,829 --> 00:34:51,735
Straight line!

595
00:35:06,715 --> 00:35:08,180
Hannah!

596
00:35:15,688 --> 00:35:17,528
What have you got?

597
00:35:18,378 --> 00:35:20,193
It's a pair of knickers.

598
00:35:36,861 --> 00:35:39,695
What's happening?
Hey? What are you doing?

599
00:35:42,352 --> 00:35:43,930
What's going on up there?

600
00:35:44,018 --> 00:35:45,459
What's happening?

601
00:35:50,627 --> 00:35:52,961
I'd like to get into that loft,
please, Mr Barlow.

602
00:35:56,798 --> 00:35:59,070
He's always going out
and driving at night.

603
00:35:59,193 --> 00:36:01,564
- So secretive, he is.
- Shut up, Mother!

604
00:36:23,898 --> 00:36:25,742
I told my mother
I'd got rid of him.

605
00:36:26,238 --> 00:36:27,781
Please, don't say anything.

606
00:36:28,283 --> 00:36:30,531
The intel team's been working on
the cab companies.

607
00:36:30,619 --> 00:36:32,039
They've come up with a cabbie

608
00:36:32,127 --> 00:36:34,427
who's got three previous convictions
for sexual touching.

609
00:36:34,515 --> 00:36:36,041
We're doing checks on him now,

610
00:36:36,211 --> 00:36:38,845
trying to establish his movements
on Friday night, Saturday morning.

611
00:36:38,932 --> 00:36:41,291
Mm.
Did you hear about the knickers?

612
00:36:41,826 --> 00:36:44,195
The search team found a ripped pair
in Savernake Forest

613
00:36:44,283 --> 00:36:45,197
close to one of the entry points.

614
00:36:45,285 --> 00:36:47,181
I've asked Genevieve
to fast track it to Forensics.

615
00:36:47,268 --> 00:36:51,078
- Sarah, what have you got?
- CCTV footage from the High Street.

616
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:54,039
OK, this is the east side
of the High Street,

617
00:36:54,273 --> 00:36:56,605
so Sian crossed the road
after she left Suju's.

618
00:36:56,912 --> 00:36:58,742
Looks a little
the worse for wear.

619
00:36:59,285 --> 00:37:01,492
She's headed
in the direction of home.

620
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:02,750
Correct.

621
00:37:07,061 --> 00:37:08,656
And then...

622
00:37:09,086 --> 00:37:11,422
...she disappears into the headlights.

623
00:37:14,133 --> 00:37:15,828
He's got his hazards on.

624
00:37:31,045 --> 00:37:32,257
She's gone.

625
00:37:32,471 --> 00:37:35,049
I've watched it again and again.
You see her go into headlights,

626
00:37:35,137 --> 00:37:36,714
then, after the car drives off,
she's not there.

627
00:37:36,801 --> 00:37:39,767
- She must have got in the car.
- Play it again.

628
00:37:41,035 --> 00:37:43,628
There's 65 seconds between
Sian going into the headlights

629
00:37:43,716 --> 00:37:45,445
and then the car driving away.

630
00:37:52,258 --> 00:37:55,744
Why would you get in a car
that's going in the wrong direction?

631
00:37:55,908 --> 00:37:57,877
- Maybe she knew the driver.
- OK, play it again,

632
00:37:57,965 --> 00:37:59,627
frame by frame,
as the car leaves.

633
00:38:03,149 --> 00:38:04,521
It's an estate.

634
00:38:04,701 --> 00:38:06,292
We can't tell the model yet,
we've got a team on it.

635
00:38:06,379 --> 00:38:07,355
Colour?

636
00:38:07,443 --> 00:38:09,163
All we can really say
is it's dark-coloured.

637
00:38:09,379 --> 00:38:12,419
Could be black, dark blue, green even.

638
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:14,163
It's luggage rails.

639
00:38:15,156 --> 00:38:17,635
I can't tell if she got in the car
or not.

640
00:38:18,399 --> 00:38:19,791
Stop.

641
00:38:21,585 --> 00:38:22,822
What's that?

642
00:38:26,193 --> 00:38:27,408
Difficult to see..

643
00:38:27,543 --> 00:38:29,596
- A sign, maybe?
- Play it again.

644
00:38:35,055 --> 00:38:37,744
What about the rest of the CCTV
from other premises?

645
00:38:37,832 --> 00:38:40,646
- Still being processed.
- We've got to make sure

646
00:38:40,734 --> 00:38:42,534
she doesn't just pop up again
further down the hill.

647
00:38:42,621 --> 00:38:45,463
We need to be as sure as we can be
that she got into that car.

648
00:38:45,725 --> 00:38:47,986
- OK, thanks, boss.
- Good work.

649
00:38:56,937 --> 00:38:59,502
I always worry about her
catching the flu.

650
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:03,119
I can't bear
the thought of her

651
00:39:03,207 --> 00:39:04,439
sleeping out rough.

652
00:39:04,527 --> 00:39:07,486
Well, she won't be if
she's running that club in Bristol.

653
00:39:08,695 --> 00:39:11,215
We can't really be sure
she's still there.

654
00:39:18,508 --> 00:39:20,189
It's not her.

655
00:39:20,625 --> 00:39:22,885
Come on, that's enough.
She's not here tonight.

656
00:39:23,108 --> 00:39:25,635
- We'll come back again next week.
- Well, I'll just...

657
00:39:25,875 --> 00:39:28,963
...take them the sandwiches,
poor things.

658
00:39:42,618 --> 00:39:44,611
So, Becky Godden, her name is.

659
00:39:44,699 --> 00:39:46,447
Or she might call herself
Becky Edwards.

660
00:39:46,535 --> 00:39:49,494
And she's a little blonde thing,
only four-foot, 11.

661
00:39:49,582 --> 00:39:51,378
But she tells everyone
she's five-foot, three.

662
00:39:51,465 --> 00:39:54,593
But if you hear about her,
will you let me know next time?

663
00:39:54,745 --> 00:39:56,502
I'm out here most weeks.

664
00:39:57,384 --> 00:39:59,572
All right, thanks. Night-night.

665
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:00,682
<i>- Bye.
- Night-night.</i>

666
00:40:00,770 --> 00:40:02,752
Take care. Night, girls.

667
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,463
You look after yourselves.

668
00:40:04,861 --> 00:40:07,674
All right, night.

669
00:40:11,007 --> 00:40:12,775
- Here you are.
- Thanks.

670
00:40:14,023 --> 00:40:15,804
- The girls got that for you.
- Hm.

671
00:40:15,892 --> 00:40:18,088
- They bought it with my mum.
- It looks nice.

672
00:40:20,906 --> 00:40:23,892
- Do you really think she's still alive?
- Erm...

673
00:40:24,156 --> 00:40:27,266
Well, I've got to, haven't I?
I don't do this to find dead bodies.

674
00:40:30,574 --> 00:40:33,439
I've got to believe I can save her,
haven't I?

675
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,485
- Yeah.
- I'm glad you are home.

676
00:40:53,055 --> 00:40:55,078
- Steve, have you got a minute?
- Excuse me.

677
00:40:55,166 --> 00:40:57,002
Er, yeah, I'm just about to go
into the press conference, Mike.

678
00:40:57,089 --> 00:41:00,737
- I heard you met with Ray Hayward.
- I had a coffee with him off base.

679
00:41:00,825 --> 00:41:02,456
Probably best
not to have any contact with him

680
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:04,484
whilst the investigation into him
is ongoing.

681
00:41:04,572 --> 00:41:06,172
Well, like I said,
it was just a coffee.

682
00:41:07,133 --> 00:41:09,352
Like I said, probably best not to.

683
00:41:09,784 --> 00:41:11,149
Hm?

684
00:41:13,518 --> 00:41:15,024
Excuse me.

685
00:41:25,361 --> 00:41:26,840
Er, these things are...

686
00:41:27,357 --> 00:41:28,790
horrible and intrusive...

687
00:41:28,878 --> 00:41:30,470
But they're a necessary evil,

688
00:41:30,558 --> 00:41:32,471
otherwise I wouldn't have
asked you to do this.

689
00:41:32,824 --> 00:41:34,907
Have you decided
who's going to speak?

690
00:41:35,731 --> 00:41:37,001
I want to do it.

691
00:41:37,243 --> 00:41:38,816
We don't want you breaking down
in the middle of it.

692
00:41:38,903 --> 00:41:40,954
- I won't.
- Are you sure, Kev?

693
00:41:41,042 --> 00:41:42,675
I want to stop people
thinking about me,

694
00:41:42,763 --> 00:41:44,997
wondering if her boyfriend did it
and all that shit.

695
00:41:45,085 --> 00:41:46,463
Just start concentrating
on finding Sian.

696
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:47,603
Mm.

697
00:41:47,821 --> 00:41:50,064
Well, if he wants to do it,

698
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:51,766
you know, it's fine by me.

699
00:41:52,063 --> 00:41:54,116
Whatever makes
the biggest impact.

700
00:41:54,739 --> 00:41:57,626
- If he has to stop, then I'll take over.
- Good.

701
00:41:58,372 --> 00:41:59,925
Er, Elaine, can you make sure

702
00:42:00,013 --> 00:42:01,603
that you're sat next to Kevin,
please?

703
00:42:01,691 --> 00:42:03,220
Two for the price of one.

704
00:42:05,843 --> 00:42:07,040
Right, are we good?

705
00:42:32,098 --> 00:42:35,097
We all just
want to know that Sian is OK.

706
00:42:35,731 --> 00:42:38,484
She has been missing now
for over two days.

707
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:39,823
Karen...

708
00:42:39,911 --> 00:42:41,910
We are praying
for Sian's safe return.

709
00:42:41,998 --> 00:42:46,362
It's not like her not to come home
or contact us for such a long time.

710
00:42:46,449 --> 00:42:47,605
It is her.

711
00:42:48,186 --> 00:42:51,100
That's the mum. She lives
over the road from us, Charlie.

712
00:42:51,265 --> 00:42:52,366
We want her home safe and well.

713
00:42:52,453 --> 00:42:54,363
I haven't spoken to her,
but it's definitely her.

714
00:42:54,450 --> 00:42:56,253
It's heart-breaking
not knowing where she is.

715
00:42:56,341 --> 00:42:57,462
Poor woman.

716
00:42:57,550 --> 00:43:01,628
Someone out there must have seen Sian
or knows where she is.

717
00:43:02,504 --> 00:43:05,417
We just want them to come forward
and contact the police.

718
00:43:06,089 --> 00:43:07,784
Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen.

719
00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:11,573
Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen.

720
00:43:11,661 --> 00:43:14,979
Our press officer will try and help
you with any further information.

721
00:43:15,067 --> 00:43:18,378
- Did all right, didn't he?
- Mm, really good to the end.

722
00:43:19,012 --> 00:43:21,940
Intel's come back on Philip Barlow,
Monster Munch man.

723
00:43:22,028 --> 00:43:24,323
- Mm-hm.
- He has eight previous convictions.

724
00:43:24,411 --> 00:43:27,324
Mostly theft, dishonesty.
One for assault.

725
00:43:27,473 --> 00:43:28,995
Yeah, his car's not dark-coloured.

726
00:43:29,126 --> 00:43:32,510
Anything on the cabbie
with the history of sexual touching?

727
00:43:33,468 --> 00:43:35,417
No, nothing back yet.

728
00:43:36,395 --> 00:43:38,549
- You'd better get off to your meeting.
- Yeah.

729
00:43:38,637 --> 00:43:40,182
- Steve...
- Mm-hm?

730
00:43:41,575 --> 00:43:44,575
I've just had a call
from a mate at Devizes nick.

731
00:43:45,892 --> 00:43:47,089
Sorry, mate...

732
00:43:47,934 --> 00:43:50,229
...apparently Ray Hayward
topped himself.

733
00:43:51,621 --> 00:43:52,847
What?

734
00:43:53,135 --> 00:43:55,735
Yeah, his girlfriend found him
hanging in the garage this morning.

735
00:43:59,788 --> 00:44:01,260
What?

736
00:44:08,610 --> 00:44:09,823
Well done, Kev.

737
00:44:09,911 --> 00:44:11,610
You done really well.

738
00:44:14,954 --> 00:44:16,635
Was it nerve-racking, Elaine?

739
00:44:17,047 --> 00:44:19,067
To be honest,
I felt like a puppet.

740
00:44:19,176 --> 00:44:21,689
Move a hand or blow your nose
and the photographers went mad.

741
00:44:21,777 --> 00:44:23,083
I just felt manipulated.

742
00:44:23,545 --> 00:44:25,458
Mick, give Elaine a cuddle.

743
00:44:25,546 --> 00:44:27,225
I don't need a cuddle.

744
00:44:27,632 --> 00:44:29,122
I'm all right, thanks.

745
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:35,184
Are you OK?

746
00:44:35,272 --> 00:44:36,272
Hey.

747
00:44:41,895 --> 00:44:43,091
Why, Debs?

748
00:44:43,179 --> 00:44:44,413
Why kill himself?

749
00:44:44,501 --> 00:44:46,415
Yeah, he had this investigation
hanging over him,

750
00:44:46,502 --> 00:44:48,676
but he had kids, for Christ's sake!

751
00:44:50,456 --> 00:44:53,029
Steve, you've got to take a look
at Ray Hayward.

752
00:44:53,743 --> 00:44:54,993
What do you mean?

753
00:44:55,081 --> 00:44:57,219
I mean, now.
As part of this investigation.

754
00:44:57,418 --> 00:44:59,331
- You've got to take a look at him.
- Why?

755
00:44:59,704 --> 00:45:02,266
- Because he gave me a lift home once.
- Come on, not you, too!

756
00:45:02,354 --> 00:45:05,165
No, no, he didn't try any funny business.
Nothing like that.

757
00:45:05,590 --> 00:45:07,711
I just remember his car
was an estate car.

758
00:45:07,878 --> 00:45:10,915
A dark estate car,
with them luggage rails on the roof.

759
00:45:11,305 --> 00:46:11,490
