1
00:00:06,906 --> 00:00:09,578
Boss, you've got to come
and have a look at this.

2
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:11,144
That's it.
It's got the white thing

3
00:00:11,232 --> 00:00:12,047
on the side.
That's got to be it.

4
00:00:12,135 --> 00:00:14,242
The white thing's a taxi decal.
He's a cab driver.

5
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:17,237
The car is 
a green Toyota Avensis estate,

6
00:00:17,325 --> 00:00:19,372
registered owner
Christopher John Halliwell.

7
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:20,810
OK, we've got him.

8
00:00:21,787 --> 00:00:23,755
Where the hell has he gone?
Which way, Tracy?

9
00:00:23,843 --> 00:00:25,974
Straight on. I am sure 
he's heading for Barbury Castle.

10
00:00:26,062 --> 00:00:27,508
How long ago
did you lose him?

11
00:00:27,742 --> 00:00:29,341
About half an hour ago.

12
00:00:31,403 --> 00:00:32,539
That was him.

13
00:00:33,523 --> 00:00:34,757
Yeah, good news.

14
00:00:35,582 --> 00:00:36,814
He's going into the chemist's.

15
00:00:36,903 --> 00:00:39,355
- How many did he buy?
- Four boxes, all paracetamol.

16
00:00:39,442 --> 00:00:41,582
So we have to arrest him.
He's suicidal.

17
00:00:47,003 --> 00:00:48,184
Hello, Christopher.

18
00:00:48,293 --> 00:00:51,244
I'm investigating the disappearance
of Sian O'Callaghan.

19
00:00:51,332 --> 00:00:53,090
Are you going to tell me
where she is?

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,074

21
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,223
OK, I'll ask again,
Christopher.

22
00:01:20,311 --> 00:01:22,067
Are you going to tell
me where Sian is?

23
00:01:24,244 --> 00:01:25,762
Tell me
where she is.

24
00:01:27,192 --> 00:01:29,122
Look, if you tell us where she is,
then, whatever else happens,

25
00:01:29,209 --> 00:01:30,957
you will have done
the right thing.

26
00:01:40,019 --> 00:01:42,212
I want to go to a police station,
I want to see a solicitor.

27
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,127
You'll get the chance
to speak to a solicitor.

28
00:01:44,215 --> 00:01:45,645
But first of all, here, now,

29
00:01:45,733 --> 00:01:48,840
I'm giving you the opportunity
to tell me where Sian is.

30
00:01:50,328 --> 00:01:51,551
You think I did it?

31
00:01:54,131 --> 00:01:55,418
I know you did it.

32
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:25,227
Look, you can stand there,
but I'm not going away.

33
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:30,672
Right.

34
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:34,789
We go back
to the station

35
00:02:34,953 --> 00:02:36,992
and in about
one hour's time...

36
00:02:37,554 --> 00:02:40,352
...the fact that you have been
arrested and who you are

37
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,674
will be in the press.

38
00:02:42,602 --> 00:02:45,993
And by the end of this cycle,
you will be vilified, Christopher.

39
00:02:46,081 --> 00:02:47,652
And to begin with,
purely by association,

40
00:02:47,739 --> 00:02:50,559
it will also be tough
for your family.

41
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:01,979
This is your last chance...

42
00:03:03,828 --> 00:03:06,378
...to do the right thing...

43
00:03:07,496 --> 00:03:09,534
...and tell me where Sian is.

44
00:03:16,371 --> 00:03:17,744
Have you got a car?

45
00:03:22,565 --> 00:03:24,753
Er, Christopher,
this way, this way.

46
00:03:37,862 --> 00:03:39,155
Is that OK? Not too tight?

47
00:03:39,243 --> 00:03:40,628
- Fine.
- Yeah?

48
00:03:42,228 --> 00:03:44,440
Tell Tracy to follow,
then get back in this car.

49
00:03:44,528 --> 00:03:46,043
Why? He just wants to go back
to Swindon

50
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:47,650
- and the police station.
- Just do it.

51
00:03:50,332 --> 00:03:52,479
- He's asking you to follow at a distance.
- OK.

52
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:54,852
Right, Eddie...

53
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,932
...Chris is going to give you
some directions.

54
00:03:57,198 --> 00:04:00,549
Now, Chris, just direct Eddie
wherever you want to go.

55
00:04:01,076 --> 00:04:03,003
Er, straight out of the car park.

56
00:04:43,167 --> 00:04:44,831

58
00:04:59,296 --> 00:05:01,626
Erm, turn left

59
00:05:01,714 --> 00:05:03,487
at the next junction.

60
00:05:16,238 --> 00:05:18,614
<i>Can you confirm
convoy destination?</i>

61
00:05:18,723 --> 00:05:21,848
<i>They're taking a left,
they're heading away from Swindon.</i>

62
00:05:38,566 --> 00:05:39,799
Oh, my feet are freezing.

63
00:05:39,887 --> 00:05:42,161
Can I have the heaters on,
please?

64
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:46,176
Turn it up, Eddie.

65
00:05:48,812 --> 00:05:50,229
Cigarette, Chris?

66
00:05:50,317 --> 00:05:52,317
- Er, yes, please.
- Yeah.

67
00:05:55,035 --> 00:05:56,364
Here.

68
00:05:56,963 --> 00:05:58,653
Thank you.

69
00:06:09,388 --> 00:06:11,020
Thank you.

70
00:06:25,872 --> 00:06:29,254
<i>X-ray Mike One One,
can you confirm convoy status?</i>

71
00:06:29,473 --> 00:06:33,395
<i>The convoy is heading north-east,
approaching Uffington.</i>

72
00:06:34,732 --> 00:06:37,284
Right at the next junction.

73
00:06:37,372 --> 00:06:39,676
Now, slow down
because the road narrows.

74
00:06:58,071 --> 00:06:59,364
Yeah, this is it.

75
00:06:59,451 --> 00:07:02,051
She's down the side
somewhere along here.

76
00:07:02,725 --> 00:07:04,137
Slow down.

77
00:07:05,622 --> 00:07:08,708
Yeah. I moved her body
a couple of nights ago.

78
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,473
Her body?

79
00:07:11,186 --> 00:07:12,567
She's dead?

80
00:07:13,442 --> 00:07:14,762
Yeah.

81
00:07:23,019 --> 00:07:24,649
Why did you do that...

82
00:07:25,566 --> 00:07:26,884
...move her body?

83
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:28,588
Well, you was getting
close to her

84
00:07:28,676 --> 00:07:30,825
when you was searching
round Ramsbury.

85
00:07:36,128 --> 00:07:37,598
Is she concealed?

86
00:07:38,653 --> 00:07:40,176
She's not concealed, no.

87
00:07:40,324 --> 00:07:43,098
I rolled her down the bank.
A steep drop, it was.

88
00:07:44,426 --> 00:07:45,879
Is she clothed?

89
00:07:46,911 --> 00:07:48,442
Mostly clothed.

90
00:07:49,725 --> 00:07:51,713
Can you remember
what she was wearing?

91
00:07:51,801 --> 00:07:53,364
A grey dress.

92
00:07:54,615 --> 00:07:55,903
You see...

93
00:07:56,441 --> 00:07:59,354
...it was dark when I brought her
here, so I don't remember,

94
00:07:59,606 --> 00:08:02,026
like, the exact point
I dumped her.

95
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:03,989
When did you last know
that she was here?

96
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:07,270
Er, Tuesday,
when I moved her body.

97
00:08:07,559 --> 00:08:08,878
Tuesday?

98
00:08:09,552 --> 00:08:11,004
Yeah.

99
00:08:16,807 --> 00:08:18,762
Yeah, she's...

100
00:08:19,683 --> 00:08:21,559
...along this stretch somewhere.

101
00:08:21,661 --> 00:08:23,106
OK, Eddie,
stop here.

102
00:08:44,268 --> 00:08:45,629
Tracy...

103
00:08:45,809 --> 00:08:48,864
...put a car on either end
of this lane and close it off.

104
00:08:48,997 --> 00:08:50,440
She's somewhere along here,

105
00:08:50,528 --> 00:08:54,161
down the bottom of that verge that
runs along the side of the road.

106
00:08:55,378 --> 00:08:57,058
- Is she dead?
- Yeah.

107
00:08:57,785 --> 00:09:00,394
And he says he dumped her
on Tuesday fucking night

108
00:09:00,482 --> 00:09:03,026
- when we lost him for that hour or so.
- Oh, God.

109
00:09:03,114 --> 00:09:05,195
The strategy worked.
He would've taken us straight to her

110
00:09:05,282 --> 00:09:06,880
- if we hadn't lost him.
- I'm so sorry, boss.

111
00:09:06,967 --> 00:09:08,317
Fuck!

112
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,898
It's all right,
you don't need to apologise.

113
00:09:10,985 --> 00:09:12,536
It wasn't done on purpose.

114
00:09:14,281 --> 00:09:16,354
Get some searchers on this
right away.

115
00:09:16,442 --> 00:09:18,237
He says the body's
not concealed.

116
00:09:18,395 --> 00:09:21,622
- I was hoping we were going to save her.
- Yeah, it's a shitty day.

117
00:09:26,356 --> 00:09:28,870
Christopher, er,
this was the right thing to do.

118
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:31,956
Erm, another officer will read you
your rights again

119
00:09:32,044 --> 00:09:33,355
and take you back
to Gable Cross

120
00:09:33,442 --> 00:09:34,843
- Police Station.
- We need to chat,

121
00:09:34,957 --> 00:09:36,373
me and you, now.

122
00:09:37,457 --> 00:09:38,977
But not here.

123
00:09:48,126 --> 00:09:49,997
Eddie, take us somewhere
quiet.

124
00:10:14,419 --> 00:10:15,899
You will find her.

125
00:10:17,114 --> 00:10:20,497
When we do,
will we find anything disturbing?

126
00:10:21,674 --> 00:10:22,997
Was it just straight sex?

127
00:10:23,085 --> 00:10:24,965
I didn't have sex
with her.

128
00:10:28,531 --> 00:10:30,106
How was she killed?

129
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,145
A knife in the back of the head.

130
00:10:41,788 --> 00:10:43,372
Where's the knife now?

131
00:10:44,104 --> 00:10:47,879
Well, anywhere between here
and Marlborough.

132
00:11:24,334 --> 00:11:26,036
Shall we take a walk?

133
00:11:35,336 --> 00:11:37,465
Nobody past you, please, Eddie.

134
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:25,757
What did you want to talk to me
about?

135
00:12:29,936 --> 00:12:31,601
I'm a sick fucker.

136
00:12:35,983 --> 00:12:38,078
Is it too late
to get help?

137
00:12:38,401 --> 00:12:40,117
I'm afraid
it's gone beyond that.

138
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:49,093
Do you want another one?

139
00:12:51,702 --> 00:12:53,328
Another one?

140
00:12:54,028 --> 00:12:55,274
Mm.

141
00:13:01,726 --> 00:13:03,062
When?

142
00:13:03,284 --> 00:13:06,825
It would have been 2003, 2004 or 2005.

143
00:13:06,913 --> 00:13:08,661
I can't remember exactly.

144
00:13:09,129 --> 00:13:10,788
- Where?
- Eastleach.

145
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:13,122
The other side of
Lechlade-on-Thames.

146
00:13:18,406 --> 00:13:20,497
Was it similar circumstances?

147
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:22,638
Pretty much.

148
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,122
Out in the open, like.

149
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,575
Look, I know you're not, erm...

150
00:13:29,453 --> 00:13:32,193
...a psychiatrist,
but what the fuck is wrong with me?

151
00:13:32,405 --> 00:13:34,110
You know,
normal people don't go round

152
00:13:34,198 --> 00:13:35,950
killing each
other, do they?

153
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:41,693
Is it just these two?
Are there any more?

154
00:13:42,189 --> 00:13:43,740
Isn't that enough?

155
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:50,146
Who is this girl?
This other girl?

156
00:13:52,741 --> 00:13:54,286
She was a prostitute.

157
00:13:55,341 --> 00:13:58,591
I took her from the Manchester Road
area of Swindon.

158
00:13:59,592 --> 00:14:01,279
You know Sian wasn't one?

159
00:14:02,302 --> 00:14:04,005
I do now.

160
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,966
Do you know why you've done
what you've done?

161
00:14:12,725 --> 00:14:15,169
I can't explain it
to myself.

162
00:14:16,694 --> 00:14:17,810
You know...

163
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:22,247
...I don't think I'll get
community service.

164
00:14:24,003 --> 00:14:27,661
Would you be able to take us
back there, to where she is now?

165
00:14:30,265 --> 00:14:32,185
To the exact spot.

166
00:14:42,565 --> 00:14:43,617
Back to the nick?

167
00:14:43,705 --> 00:14:46,060
No, we're going
to another location.

168
00:14:46,694 --> 00:14:47,967
Chris'll give us directions.

169
00:14:48,055 --> 00:14:49,818
And get Bob Cooper
to join us.

170
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,888
Christ,
I have women customers

171
00:15:25,976 --> 00:15:27,771
who phone up
and ask for me specifically

172
00:15:27,884 --> 00:15:30,873
because they trust me
to get them home safely.

173
00:15:31,036 --> 00:15:34,362
You ask the cab company.
Loads of them ask for me special.

174
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:35,732
Loads of them!

175
00:15:38,346 --> 00:15:40,537
So what happened
with this other girl, Chris?

176
00:15:41,809 --> 00:15:43,576
I picked her up
in the cab.

177
00:15:45,873 --> 00:15:48,146
I had sex with her in the back.

178
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:50,029
And, erm...

179
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:53,013
...then I killed her.

180
00:15:57,874 --> 00:15:59,130
How?

181
00:15:59,604 --> 00:16:01,310
I strangled her.

182
00:16:02,315 --> 00:16:03,810
I stripped her body.

183
00:16:03,898 --> 00:16:06,193
I left it over a wall
by the edge of a field.

184
00:16:06,289 --> 00:16:10,552
The next day, I came back
and I dug a five-foot grave.

185
00:16:11,449 --> 00:16:12,943
It took me all night.

186
00:16:13,474 --> 00:16:14,787
And I...

187
00:16:14,881 --> 00:16:16,396
...put her in there.

188
00:16:21,197 --> 00:16:23,197
Did you ever return to the grave?

189
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:26,803
From time to time, yeah.

190
00:16:27,029 --> 00:16:29,279
Just to check
everything was all right.

191
00:16:30,272 --> 00:16:32,084
When was the last time
you went back there?

192
00:16:32,987 --> 00:16:34,521
Er...

193
00:16:36,181 --> 00:16:37,794
About three year ago.

194
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:58,101
I'm looking for this dip
in the wall.

195
00:16:58,248 --> 00:17:01,468
That's how I know
where I am.

196
00:17:01,932 --> 00:17:03,932
There's, like, this dip.

197
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:06,976
And it's just... It's just there.

198
00:17:07,508 --> 00:17:09,406
There. Stop here, Eddie.

199
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:35,213
Yeah.

200
00:17:35,495 --> 00:17:36,744
Down there.

201
00:17:37,715 --> 00:17:39,869
Will you help me
over the wall?

202
00:17:47,701 --> 00:17:50,034
Is he actually
showing us another body?

203
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:51,659
I think he is, yeah.

204
00:17:52,698 --> 00:17:54,018
Bob.

205
00:17:57,769 --> 00:17:59,408
...six, seven...

206
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:01,956
...eight, nine, ten.

207
00:18:05,471 --> 00:18:06,933
She's down there.

208
00:18:18,689 --> 00:18:20,709
OK, I'll ask you again,
are there any more?

209
00:18:21,188 --> 00:18:22,459
No.

210
00:18:26,967 --> 00:18:28,809
Right, we'll take you back
to the station now

211
00:18:28,897 --> 00:18:30,928
and you'll just need to tell
the officers who interview you

212
00:18:31,015 --> 00:18:33,408
everything you've told me
this morning, and then it's done.

213
00:18:33,495 --> 00:18:35,662
I don't want to have
to talk about it again, Steve.

214
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:38,209
You'll have to.
We need the detail of what happened.

215
00:18:38,447 --> 00:18:42,045
I'll make sure your family
are relocated away from the press.

216
00:18:42,139 --> 00:18:43,504
Two victims, Bob.

217
00:18:43,592 --> 00:18:44,991
The second
as yet unidentified.

218
00:18:45,108 --> 00:18:47,287
Re-arrest and caution
and take him back to Gable Cross.

219
00:18:47,545 --> 00:18:49,254
Christopher Halliwell,
I am arresting you

220
00:18:49,342 --> 00:18:51,068
on suspicion of the murder of Sian
O'Callaghan...

221
00:18:51,155 --> 00:18:53,170
...and of another unknown person.

222
00:18:53,307 --> 00:18:54,451
Tracy?

223
00:18:54,632 --> 00:18:56,944
Sir, we've found her.
It's definitely Sian.

224
00:18:57,194 --> 00:18:58,997
- Is she clothed?
- Partially.

225
00:18:59,084 --> 00:19:00,623
Leggings and knickers pulled down.

226
00:19:01,171 --> 00:19:02,889
Some of her clothing's
been cut away.

227
00:19:03,099 --> 00:19:05,490
Looks like she was killed
with a stab to the back of the head.

228
00:19:05,577 --> 00:19:07,862
How about you? Got another one there?

229
00:19:07,949 --> 00:19:10,408
There's no body yet,
but he's given us an exact location.

230
00:19:10,504 --> 00:19:12,025
We're taking him
back to the station now.

231
00:19:12,112 --> 00:19:13,590
Listen, I'd better go.
Cheers.

232
00:19:15,899 --> 00:19:17,475
Come on, watch your head.

233
00:19:23,589 --> 00:19:25,030
I'm sorry.

234
00:19:27,334 --> 00:19:28,687
- I've just got to take this.
- Mm.

235
00:19:28,775 --> 00:19:30,216
Right, thank you.

236
00:19:31,667 --> 00:19:34,342
- She's got to be thorough... Yeah.
- Really, hasn't she?

237
00:19:35,115 --> 00:19:36,650
Are you all right, love?

238
00:20:52,632 --> 00:20:53,724
Hi.

239
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,279
- Do they know?
- Yes. Yeah.

240
00:21:00,084 --> 00:21:01,912
- Halliwell?
- No.

241
00:21:09,889 --> 00:21:11,052
Elaine...

242
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,068
I'm so sorry.

243
00:21:23,189 --> 00:21:24,841
I did everything I could.

244
00:21:27,482 --> 00:21:30,747
We have arrested a man
for her murder.

245
00:21:31,552 --> 00:21:33,466
His name is Christopher Halliwell.

246
00:21:33,661 --> 00:21:37,396
I don't know if that name
means anything to any of you.

247
00:21:38,865 --> 00:21:40,716
I believe she was killed

248
00:21:41,153 --> 00:21:44,544
shortly after Halliwell
picked her up... in his taxi

249
00:21:44,632 --> 00:21:46,294
in the early hours of
Saturday morning.

250
00:21:51,078 --> 00:21:52,763
Thanks for finding her.

251
00:21:54,482 --> 00:21:55,644
Thanks.

252
00:22:03,255 --> 00:22:04,669
Here he is!

253
00:22:11,677 --> 00:22:13,677
- Proud of you, Steve.
- Nice one, Steve.

254
00:22:14,481 --> 00:22:15,880
This is to establish, Christopher,

255
00:22:15,968 --> 00:22:18,177
that you are fit enough
for detention.

256
00:22:39,334 --> 00:22:40,645
Hm...

257
00:22:44,028 --> 00:22:45,760
Do you know why you are here,
Christopher?

258
00:22:45,848 --> 00:22:47,099
Yeah.

259
00:22:47,301 --> 00:22:49,301
I've killed two people.

260
00:22:50,144 --> 00:22:51,591
Could you give me your arm, please?

261
00:22:58,911 --> 00:23:00,309
Mm?

262
00:23:00,817 --> 00:23:02,125
You did it, mate.

263
00:23:02,212 --> 00:23:04,716
Bloody hell, two of them.
What happened?

264
00:23:04,941 --> 00:23:08,542
Er, well, he took us to Uffington,
where he'd dumped Sian's body.

265
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:10,198
And then he asks for a chat.

266
00:23:10,286 --> 00:23:13,856
And then he suddenly said,
"Do you want another one?"

267
00:23:14,104 --> 00:23:16,028
- Jesus...!
- Mm.

268
00:23:16,129 --> 00:23:19,120
So, when did you caution him,
after he coughed to Sian?

269
00:23:19,208 --> 00:23:21,309
No, I was going to and then
he said about this other one.

270
00:23:21,396 --> 00:23:23,309
What, so you cautioned him then?

271
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:25,270
How could I?

272
00:23:25,411 --> 00:23:26,934
Well, what about PACE?

273
00:23:27,192 --> 00:23:29,706
Steve, he was going to take me
to a burial ground

274
00:23:29,794 --> 00:23:31,911
that no-one knew about
except for him.

275
00:23:32,083 --> 00:23:34,190
What was I supposed to do,
turn round halfway there,

276
00:23:34,278 --> 00:23:36,737
bring him back to the station
so he can see a solicitor?

277
00:23:36,825 --> 00:23:38,509
Look, if we hadn't gone there
right then,

278
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:42,270
this other girl would be
lost forever.

279
00:23:43,314 --> 00:23:44,794
Do you know what I mean?

280
00:23:46,723 --> 00:23:48,636
- Do you want a drink or something?
- Uh-uh.

281
00:23:48,724 --> 00:23:50,084
Are you sure?

282
00:23:57,016 --> 00:23:58,308
Aiden...

283
00:23:58,591 --> 00:24:00,791
- I'll tell him.
- No. No, I will.

284
00:24:03,009 --> 00:24:04,567
What's going on?

285
00:24:05,396 --> 00:24:06,409
Is it about Sian?

286
00:24:06,497 --> 00:24:08,309
Come with me, son. Good boy.

287
00:24:08,606 --> 00:24:10,924
- Mum, what's going on?
- Sorry.

288
00:24:12,342 --> 00:24:13,888
I'm so sorry, mate.

289
00:24:15,375 --> 00:24:16,693
You, er...

290
00:24:18,163 --> 00:24:20,323
You've got to try and understand
that Sian

291
00:24:20,411 --> 00:24:22,309
won't be coming home again,
all right?

292
00:24:22,396 --> 00:24:24,776
- This bad man has taken her away.
- Is she dead?

293
00:24:24,864 --> 00:24:27,628
Is she dead? Mum? Mum!

294
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:29,870
But we're all here, all together.
We're gonna stick up for each other,

295
00:24:29,958 --> 00:24:31,825
look after each other, all right?

296
00:24:31,942 --> 00:24:33,033
Yeah?

297
00:24:33,121 --> 00:24:34,364
Good boy.

298
00:24:35,439 --> 00:24:36,778
Good boy.

299
00:24:41,318 --> 00:24:42,755
Good afternoon.

300
00:24:43,396 --> 00:24:46,690
I am Detective Superintendent
Steve Fulcher.

301
00:24:46,778 --> 00:24:50,260
And I can now give you an update
on the search for Sian O'Callaghan,

302
00:24:50,348 --> 00:24:52,309
who has been missing
since last Saturday.

303
00:24:52,591 --> 00:24:54,661
<i>So, this morning,
a 47-year-old man</i>

304
00:24:54,749 --> 00:24:56,800
<i>from Swindon was arrested</i>

305
00:24:56,888 --> 00:25:00,809
on suspicion of
kidnap and two murders.

306
00:25:01,824 --> 00:25:04,614
I was today taken to the locations
of two bodies.

307
00:25:04,755 --> 00:25:07,309
But thus far,
only one has been recovered.

308
00:25:07,809 --> 00:25:10,122
Although we haven't had
formal identification,

309
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:12,880
we believe this to be the body
of Sian O'Callaghan.

310
00:25:12,968 --> 00:25:15,096
The second girl is Becky.

311
00:25:15,184 --> 00:25:18,231
- Don't be so soft, woman.
- I know, in my heart...

312
00:25:18,372 --> 00:25:19,817
...it's her.

313
00:25:20,888 --> 00:25:23,309
Why hasn't she been home
all these years?

314
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,534
She would have contacted me
somehow.

315
00:25:25,622 --> 00:25:27,073
Yeah, but people have seen her.

316
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,309
John's family have seen her,
for Christ's sake.

317
00:25:29,396 --> 00:25:32,044
- It can't be her.
- You're wrong.

318
00:25:42,141 --> 00:25:43,941
Mate! Mate!

319
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,049
It's solid clay. There's no way
she's buried down there.

320
00:25:50,137 --> 00:25:51,396
It's impossible.

321
00:25:52,318 --> 00:25:54,751
Duty solicitor,
here to see the prisoner Halliwell.

322
00:25:54,916 --> 00:25:56,309
- There you go, sir.
- Thank you.

323
00:25:56,442 --> 00:25:57,844
Thank you.

324
00:25:58,813 --> 00:26:00,800
Christopher, this is Mr Coleman,

325
00:26:00,888 --> 00:26:02,543
who's been assigned as your solicitor.

326
00:26:02,631 --> 00:26:04,631
Take a seat,
Mr Halliwell.

327
00:26:08,686 --> 00:26:09,919
Right.

328
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:22,364
OK, thank you.

329
00:26:24,887 --> 00:26:26,577
- Can I help you?
- Yes.

330
00:26:26,665 --> 00:26:29,536
Erm, I've come in because, erm, I...

331
00:26:29,731 --> 00:26:34,309
Because I think that this other girl
they've found with Sian O'Callaghan,

332
00:26:34,552 --> 00:26:35,829
erm, I think...

333
00:26:36,324 --> 00:26:38,308
...that it's my daughter Becky.

334
00:26:38,778 --> 00:26:40,149
What makes you think that?

335
00:26:40,372 --> 00:26:43,309
I've just got this really, really
strong feeling that I know it's her.

336
00:26:43,622 --> 00:26:47,638
So, if it's any consolation, a lot
of people have had the same feeling.

337
00:26:47,778 --> 00:26:50,104
So far, we've received
over 600 calls

338
00:26:50,192 --> 00:26:51,698
from people up and down the country

339
00:26:51,786 --> 00:26:53,768
who've suggested
that it might be their daughter.

340
00:26:53,965 --> 00:26:55,372
600?

341
00:26:55,489 --> 00:26:57,309
Let's start
with your daughter's name, please.

342
00:26:57,419 --> 00:26:58,498
Erm...

343
00:26:58,606 --> 00:27:00,677
Becky. Rebecca Godden.

344
00:27:00,817 --> 00:27:04,466
Date of birth April 4th, 1982.

345
00:27:04,598 --> 00:27:06,940
And when was she reported
as a missing person?

346
00:27:07,028 --> 00:27:10,309
Erm, well,
she hasn't been with the police.

347
00:27:10,396 --> 00:27:12,815
Er, but we registered her
as a missing person

348
00:27:12,903 --> 00:27:15,309
on the Miss You website in 2007

349
00:27:15,396 --> 00:27:17,854
because that's what we were advised
to do at the time.

350
00:27:17,942 --> 00:27:20,309
She has a long history
of going missing, you see.

351
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:22,761
So, when was the last time
you saw her?

352
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:25,011
Er, me, personally...

353
00:27:25,286 --> 00:27:27,052
...the end of 2002.

354
00:27:27,364 --> 00:27:30,034
But, er, we've heard she's been seen
by someone

355
00:27:30,122 --> 00:27:31,698
from my first husband's family.

356
00:27:31,786 --> 00:27:33,829
Because this is my husband now,
Charlie Edwards.

357
00:27:33,916 --> 00:27:36,833
But her father's side of the family,
the Goddens,

358
00:27:36,934 --> 00:27:39,620
say they saw her
only a couple of years ago.

359
00:27:39,708 --> 00:27:43,253
Er, it was 2009, I think.

360
00:27:43,341 --> 00:27:44,090
Yeah, I think that...

361
00:27:44,177 --> 00:27:46,653
So, you might not be aware yet,
but we have released a statement

362
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:48,838
narrowing down the year
that the second girl was killed

363
00:27:48,925 --> 00:27:51,106
to somewhere between 2003 and 2005.

364
00:27:51,318 --> 00:27:52,645
Oh...

365
00:27:53,278 --> 00:27:54,952
Oh, I didn't know that.

366
00:27:55,091 --> 00:27:58,714
So, if she's been seen since 2005,
it can't be her, can it?

367
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:00,404
That's the information
that we have.

368
00:28:01,747 --> 00:28:03,114
Oh!

369
00:28:03,202 --> 00:28:05,380
I told you,
you were worried about nothing.

370
00:28:05,778 --> 00:28:07,260
Oh, I'm so...

371
00:28:08,192 --> 00:28:09,997
I'm so sorry to have troubled you.
I'm...

372
00:28:10,396 --> 00:28:12,309
I feel stupid now.

373
00:28:12,622 --> 00:28:15,309
Christopher, these are copies of
the handwritten notes made earlier

374
00:28:15,396 --> 00:28:18,309
of your conversations with
Detective Superintendent Fulcher.

375
00:28:18,536 --> 00:28:21,513
I'd like to start by asking if you
could read through them carefully.

376
00:28:21,606 --> 00:28:23,309
And then, if you're happy with them,
sign them

377
00:28:23,396 --> 00:28:24,706
as a record of these conversations.

378
00:28:24,793 --> 00:28:26,684
My client will not be signing anything.

379
00:28:28,942 --> 00:28:30,518
Would you agree, Mr Halliwell,

380
00:28:30,606 --> 00:28:33,122
that these conversations
took place earlier today?

381
00:28:33,887 --> 00:28:35,450
No comment.

382
00:28:37,396 --> 00:28:39,745
And that you took my colleague Mr Fulcher

383
00:28:39,833 --> 00:28:42,107
to the bodies of two of your victims.

384
00:28:42,241 --> 00:28:43,443
No comment.

385
00:28:45,294 --> 00:28:47,309
And that the conversations
you had with Mr Fulcher

386
00:28:47,396 --> 00:28:50,236
amounted to confessions
to the murders of two women.

387
00:28:51,668 --> 00:28:52,942
No comment.

388
00:28:53,762 --> 00:28:55,829
His solicitor says he wants it noted

389
00:28:55,955 --> 00:28:58,676
that his client was denied access
to a legal representative

390
00:28:58,841 --> 00:29:00,309
for four hours after his arrest.

391
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:03,526
He's confessed to two murders!
He took me to two bodies!

392
00:29:03,614 --> 00:29:05,404
He even coughed
to the bloody doctor!

393
00:29:06,004 --> 00:29:08,721
I mean, surely, his only advice
can be to plead guilty early

394
00:29:08,809 --> 00:29:10,767
and then hope for some end date
when he's sentenced?

395
00:29:10,855 --> 00:29:12,255
Surely, that's his only play?

396
00:29:12,373 --> 00:29:14,286
He won't answer
or sign anything.

397
00:29:14,528 --> 00:29:17,309
I wasn't playing games,
I was pleading for Sian's life!

398
00:29:17,396 --> 00:29:18,958
What was I supposed to say?

399
00:29:19,236 --> 00:29:20,684
Get back in there, Bob.

400
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,481
Give him some reasons
to come across.

401
00:29:22,606 --> 00:29:25,700
Start with the fact that we haven't
found the second body yet.

402
00:29:32,856 --> 00:29:34,309
We're going now.

403
00:29:34,645 --> 00:29:36,036
We'll be back tomorrow.

404
00:29:40,428 --> 00:29:42,184
Shit, Mick.

405
00:29:45,563 --> 00:29:47,333
I'm never going to see her
again.

406
00:29:51,708 --> 00:29:52,942
Love...

407
00:30:01,785 --> 00:30:03,698
- Steve?
- Yeah.

408
00:30:04,067 --> 00:30:06,301
The girls wanted to wait up
to congratulate you.

409
00:30:06,396 --> 00:30:08,825
- We're so proud of you.
- Thank you.

410
00:30:10,044 --> 00:30:11,809
It all went OK, didn't it?

411
00:30:12,153 --> 00:30:14,177
Er, well,
he took me to two bodies

412
00:30:14,265 --> 00:30:17,216
when I wasn't expecting him
to even take me to one. So...

413
00:30:17,863 --> 00:30:20,872
...yeah, you could say
it all went very well.

414
00:30:21,245 --> 00:30:23,690
But you could also say...

415
00:30:23,778 --> 00:30:26,187
...that it went very, very...

416
00:30:27,329 --> 00:30:29,036
...very fucking badly.

417
00:30:59,167 --> 00:31:00,198
I'll do it.

418
00:31:00,286 --> 00:31:02,533
No, I don't think you should, Kev.
I certainly couldn't.

419
00:31:02,621 --> 00:31:06,028
- It can be very distressing.
- I don't care, I'm going.

420
00:31:07,622 --> 00:31:10,067
OK, that's settled.

421
00:31:10,677 --> 00:31:13,299
- It'll be myself and Kevin.
- No, I think I should go.

422
00:31:13,387 --> 00:31:15,473
No, I will do it.

423
00:31:17,036 --> 00:31:19,958
You don't want to remember her
like that, Mick.

424
00:31:41,027 --> 00:31:42,246
Eddie!

425
00:31:43,575 --> 00:31:45,027
Bring that spade.

426
00:31:50,765 --> 00:31:52,241
What is it?

427
00:31:53,187 --> 00:31:54,680
There's a dip here.

428
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,058
What if he got it wrong?

429
00:32:07,902 --> 00:32:09,167
Bring that digger!

430
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:12,292
Listen up, everyone.
Er, he's gone, "No comment."

431
00:32:12,511 --> 00:32:14,308
Which is to be expected,
I suppose.

432
00:32:14,396 --> 00:32:16,886
I mean,
that's the way it goes these days.

433
00:32:17,213 --> 00:32:19,884
Solicitors turn up, pocket their 300 quid

434
00:32:19,972 --> 00:32:21,902
and then tell their clients
not to say anything.

435
00:32:22,246 --> 00:32:23,486
Oh, well, it's their job.

436
00:32:23,574 --> 00:32:24,830
Everyone's got
to make a living, I guess.

437
00:32:24,917 --> 00:32:27,097
It's not like he's randomly said
he's killed them.

438
00:32:27,191 --> 00:32:29,237
How can they ignore the fact
he took you to the bodies?

439
00:32:29,324 --> 00:32:32,072
Yeah, well, you might think that
and I might think that.

440
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,642
And I can't see how any court

441
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:35,673
could possibly disallow
those two confessions.

442
00:32:35,761 --> 00:32:38,853
But to be on the safe side,
we'd better parallel evidence them.

443
00:32:38,941 --> 00:32:44,150
So, obviously,
we are hoping that his DNA or blood

444
00:32:44,238 --> 00:32:46,025
is going to be on Sian's body

445
00:32:46,113 --> 00:32:48,814
and Sian's DNA
is going to be on those seat covers.

446
00:32:48,902 --> 00:32:51,309
But what if it's not?
We still don't have a second body.

447
00:32:51,396 --> 00:32:53,237
So I'm going to ask the magistrates
for more time.

448
00:32:53,324 --> 00:32:55,900
Erm,
Halliwell's oldest daughter.

449
00:32:55,988 --> 00:32:58,798
- She knew Sian, didn't she?
- They had a nodding acquaintance.

450
00:32:58,886 --> 00:33:00,681
Apparently, they used to get
the same bus to college.

451
00:33:00,768 --> 00:33:01,949
Right.

452
00:33:02,643 --> 00:33:04,309
Let's see if we can appeal
to her conscience.

453
00:33:04,396 --> 00:33:06,309
- What have you got in mind?
- Erm...

454
00:33:06,396 --> 00:33:08,165
Let's ask her if she will agree

455
00:33:08,253 --> 00:33:10,251
to a covert recording
of a visit with her dad.

456
00:33:10,339 --> 00:33:13,837
See if she can get him
to repeat his confession to her.

457
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:15,558
What?
We've got nothing to lose.

458
00:33:15,674 --> 00:33:17,665
Post-mortem's revealed
that she was killed

459
00:33:17,753 --> 00:33:20,488
by two knife blows
to the back of the head.

460
00:33:20,643 --> 00:33:22,667
Some bruising to the face

461
00:33:22,855 --> 00:33:26,847
is consistent with being hit
or falling forward on to the dash.

462
00:33:27,371 --> 00:33:29,611
There's no evidence
of any sexual intercourse,

463
00:33:29,699 --> 00:33:33,808
but her underwear had been
pulled down and her bra's missing.

464
00:33:33,974 --> 00:33:37,207
- No, carry on, carry on.
- We're pretty much done.

465
00:33:37,746 --> 00:33:40,395
- Have you got a minute?
- Mm.

466
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:47,261
Keir and I just wanted to add our
congratulations to everybody else's.

467
00:33:47,349 --> 00:33:48,668
Oh, thank you.

468
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:51,308
Well done. Steve.
Excellent work.

469
00:33:51,396 --> 00:33:52,564
Thanks, Kier.

470
00:33:52,652 --> 00:33:55,746
Yeah, I did hear the confessions
weren't PACE compliant.

471
00:33:55,834 --> 00:33:58,308
No. In my opinion, they were.

472
00:33:58,396 --> 00:34:01,003
Under Section 11,
urgent interview provision.

473
00:34:02,307 --> 00:34:04,753
Well, I'm sure it'll all come out
in the wash.

474
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:07,535
- Once again, many congratulations.
- Thank you.

475
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:09,832
- Steve...
- Sir.

476
00:34:10,652 --> 00:34:12,533
Shouldn't it be Mick, rather than Pete?

477
00:34:12,621 --> 00:34:13,800
Leave it, Jackie.

478
00:34:13,902 --> 00:34:17,167
It's just that neither Pete nor Kev
are related by blood.

479
00:34:17,589 --> 00:34:20,324
Don't start a fuss, please,
you know what Pete's like.

480
00:34:20,938 --> 00:34:22,536
He just wants to help.

481
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,097
Are you all right?

482
00:34:43,094 --> 00:34:44,308
OK?

483
00:34:58,552 --> 00:34:59,839
Er...

484
00:35:00,396 --> 00:35:02,042
Yeah, it's her.

485
00:35:02,607 --> 00:35:03,980
No doubt.

486
00:35:07,321 --> 00:35:08,892
There's some paperwork.

487
00:35:09,192 --> 00:35:10,763
Of course.

488
00:35:20,621 --> 00:35:22,236
Can I hold her hand, please?

489
00:35:24,259 --> 00:35:26,743
They'll need a few moments
to prepare her.

490
00:35:34,672 --> 00:35:37,001
I'll give you some time
on your own, Kev.

491
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:40,142
If you'd like to wait,
it's the first door on the right.

492
00:35:46,884 --> 00:35:48,884
I was hoping
they'd made a mistake.

493
00:35:50,937 --> 00:35:52,195
Right up 
until the last moment,

494
00:35:52,282 --> 00:35:54,743
I was hoping, somehow,
they'd got the wrong person.

495
00:35:55,717 --> 00:35:57,243
I'm sorry.

496
00:35:59,626 --> 00:36:02,618
- We're ready for you now.
- I'll wait outside.

497
00:36:42,048 --> 00:36:43,528
Guys...!

498
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:55,740
We've found her.

499
00:37:08,197 --> 00:37:09,950
This is gaffer tape.

500
00:37:10,134 --> 00:37:13,079
Consistent with having being used
as a gag.

501
00:37:18,147 --> 00:37:19,617
No head present.

502
00:37:19,806 --> 00:37:22,187
- Which suggests two explanations.
- Uh-huh.

503
00:37:22,275 --> 00:37:23,827
Firstly, that the head was removed

504
00:37:23,915 --> 00:37:25,804
before the body
was placed into the ground.

505
00:37:25,892 --> 00:37:29,048
Or secondly, it was removed
by some sort of scavenging animal,

506
00:37:29,136 --> 00:37:32,210
who dug it up and took it away at
some point after she was buried.

507
00:37:32,298 --> 00:37:35,415
- And which way are you leaning?
- I can't say definitively.

508
00:37:35,681 --> 00:37:37,589
These marks here...

509
00:37:38,063 --> 00:37:41,155
...they could have being caused by
a knife as the head was hacked off.

510
00:37:41,243 --> 00:37:43,840
Or they could have been caused
by the teeth of a predator.

511
00:37:44,703 --> 00:37:47,351
- There's no hands or feet, either.
- The same problem.

512
00:37:47,439 --> 00:37:50,196
I can't say for certain either way
how they came to be detached.

513
00:37:50,745 --> 00:37:52,103
I'm sorry.

514
00:37:52,437 --> 00:37:55,109
First indications are that we've
discovered the body

515
00:37:55,197 --> 00:37:56,978
of a small, young female,

516
00:37:57,066 --> 00:38:00,202
and we now apply for more time
to develop forensic opportunities,

517
00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:01,892
collect passive data and, of course,

518
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:05,501
seek further opportunities
to question the witness.

519
00:38:06,796 --> 00:38:08,337
Mr Coleman...

520
00:38:09,219 --> 00:38:12,721
Detective Superintendent Fulcher,
can I ask you under oath

521
00:38:12,939 --> 00:38:15,327
whether you have been monitoring
and recording

522
00:38:15,415 --> 00:38:17,608
confidential and privileged conversations

523
00:38:17,696 --> 00:38:19,155
at Gable Cross Police Station

524
00:38:19,243 --> 00:38:21,759
between myself and my client,
Mr Halliwell?

525
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:27,165
I can assure you, sir, that no
such activities have taken place.

526
00:38:27,611 --> 00:38:31,124
As you know, I've advised my client
to offer "no comment"

527
00:38:31,212 --> 00:38:32,421
during any further interviews

528
00:38:32,509 --> 00:38:35,884
and I ask that you now respect
his decision in this matter.

529
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:39,726
I understand why you feel the need
to take that stance,

530
00:38:39,814 --> 00:38:42,415
but your client is not bound
to follow your advice.

531
00:38:43,735 --> 00:38:46,968
Christopher,
the confession you made to me

532
00:38:47,056 --> 00:38:49,960
was unbidden and genuinely contrite.

533
00:38:50,048 --> 00:38:52,110
You do not have to follow the advice
of Mr Coleman

534
00:38:52,197 --> 00:38:53,780
if it is not in your best interests.

535
00:38:53,868 --> 00:38:56,950
And I suggest saying nothing,
at this stage, is not.

536
00:38:57,037 --> 00:38:58,688
Sir, it is outrageous

537
00:38:58,915 --> 00:39:01,665
that he is challenging
the advice I'm giving to my client.

538
00:39:01,829 --> 00:39:04,173
Christopher,
you can clear your conscience

539
00:39:04,289 --> 00:39:05,976
and you can help Sian's family,

540
00:39:06,064 --> 00:39:08,226
and the family of your other victim.

541
00:39:08,314 --> 00:39:09,890
You can still do that.

542
00:39:09,978 --> 00:39:11,796
You don't have to offer "no comment".

543
00:39:11,884 --> 00:39:13,808
I think you can see
quite clearly, sir,

544
00:39:13,895 --> 00:39:16,358
the lengths to which
Detective Superintendent Fulcher

545
00:39:16,446 --> 00:39:19,150
is prepared to stoop
with this investigation.

546
00:39:22,782 --> 00:39:25,845
Thank you. We shall retire
to consider our ruling.

547
00:39:37,755 --> 00:39:42,474
Yeah, we got another 36 hours,
but the magistrates took their time.

548
00:39:42,561 --> 00:39:43,916
They were deliberating
for a good half an hour.

549
00:39:44,003 --> 00:39:45,381
Half an hour?

550
00:39:45,562 --> 00:39:47,976
They normally don't even retire.
Just wave it through.

551
00:39:48,064 --> 00:39:49,474
Listen, is Halliwell's daughter

552
00:39:49,561 --> 00:39:52,361
still up for us taping them
while they talk?

553
00:39:52,449 --> 00:39:55,362
Totally. She says she just wants him
to tell the truth.

554
00:39:55,828 --> 00:39:57,611
We're trying
to sort it out for tomorrow.

555
00:39:57,798 --> 00:39:59,946
Good work, Steve.
Speak soon, yeah?

556
00:40:00,761 --> 00:40:03,345
Why did that solicitor accuse you
of bugging his conversations?

557
00:40:03,529 --> 00:40:06,442
I don't know.
Maybe Halliwell confessed to him.

558
00:40:06,634 --> 00:40:07,803
That'd be my guess.

559
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:10,008
Are you sure about recording him
and his daughter?

560
00:40:10,095 --> 00:40:11,474
Yeah, I am, Debs.

561
00:40:11,829 --> 00:40:14,123
Bugging Halliwell and his brief
is illegal.

562
00:40:14,259 --> 00:40:16,017
Bugging him and his daughter is not.

563
00:40:16,323 --> 00:40:18,611
- Are we OK to come through?
- Yes, sir.

564
00:40:31,651 --> 00:40:34,811
Right, so,
he's got two daughters and a son...

565
00:40:35,443 --> 00:40:37,173
...with his first wife.

566
00:40:39,064 --> 00:40:40,738
- Yes? And they live with her?
- Yeah.

567
00:40:40,825 --> 00:40:42,514
And his current partner,
who he lives with now,

568
00:40:42,601 --> 00:40:44,736
has two daughters of her own
who live with them.

569
00:40:45,048 --> 00:40:46,751
We've relocated them
all.

570
00:40:52,141 --> 00:40:53,439
Hm...

571
00:41:09,681 --> 00:41:12,259
As you can see,
we'll be here a while.

572
00:41:13,203 --> 00:41:14,454
We're cataloguing everything.

573
00:41:14,561 --> 00:41:16,400
We're looking for trophies, Bob.

574
00:41:16,488 --> 00:41:18,488
Stuff from his victims
that he's kept.

575
00:41:19,083 --> 00:41:21,419
In here, in the house, in the loft.

576
00:41:21,561 --> 00:41:24,165
Let's get some soil analysis
on that shovel, please.

577
00:41:24,253 --> 00:41:26,228
See if anything on it
matches the field, eh?

578
00:41:27,081 --> 00:41:29,033
You know, after he told me
about the second victim,

579
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,165
when I asked if there were any others,

580
00:41:31,709 --> 00:41:33,269
he didn't say, "No."

581
00:41:34,435 --> 00:41:36,275
What he actually said was...

582
00:41:36,968 --> 00:41:38,532
"..Isn't that enough?"

583
00:41:57,189 --> 00:41:58,474
Thanks for agreeing to help us.

584
00:41:58,611 --> 00:42:01,025
The room has microphones in it,
so we can hear everything.

585
00:42:01,113 --> 00:42:03,710
But the most important thing
is to just act naturally.

586
00:42:03,798 --> 00:42:07,116
OK, we need you to try and get him
to repeat his confession.

587
00:42:07,204 --> 00:42:09,076
But don't let that be the first
thing you talk about,

588
00:42:09,163 --> 00:42:10,993
try to build up to it naturally. OK?

589
00:42:11,172 --> 00:42:14,712
You just sit here and we'll bring
your dad down shortly, OK?

590
00:42:26,186 --> 00:42:28,283
We've got a DNA match
for the second girl.

591
00:42:28,419 --> 00:42:31,827
Rebecca Godden.
She would have been 20 in 2003.

592
00:42:31,915 --> 00:42:35,187
Registered with the Miss You website
in 2007 by her mother Karen.

593
00:42:35,275 --> 00:42:36,674
- What is there on her?
- Er...

594
00:42:36,761 --> 00:42:39,608
Last conviction, December 2002
as an accessory to burglary,

595
00:42:39,696 --> 00:42:41,229
fined £125.

596
00:42:41,423 --> 00:42:43,812
Before that, convictions for
possession, theft

597
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:45,700
and there's loads
of local intelligence on her

598
00:42:45,790 --> 00:42:47,882
for soliciting
in the Manchester Road.

599
00:42:47,970 --> 00:42:49,474
It looks like she was feeding
a bad drug addiction.

600
00:42:49,561 --> 00:42:51,829
- Mm-hm.
- We've got an address for the mother.

601
00:42:58,060 --> 00:42:59,701
Oh, Dad...

602
00:43:00,615 --> 00:43:03,254
What have you done?

603
00:43:06,845 --> 00:43:08,118
Dad...

604
00:43:08,298 --> 00:43:11,035
If you've done these things
they're saying you've done,

605
00:43:11,123 --> 00:43:13,202
you've got to tell them everything
you know.

606
00:43:14,142 --> 00:43:16,473
You've got to help these girls' families.

607
00:43:16,912 --> 00:43:18,911
Please, Dad.

608
00:43:19,379 --> 00:43:21,179
Just tell the truth.

609
00:43:22,561 --> 00:43:24,829
- Dad...
- Listen to me.

610
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:27,962
They'll be recording this,
so say no more.

611
00:43:29,047 --> 00:43:30,568
It's all in hand.

612
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:32,659
I want you...

613
00:43:33,085 --> 00:43:34,674
...to change your name...

614
00:43:34,961 --> 00:43:39,392
...and sell your story and
you make as much money as you can.

615
00:43:40,561 --> 00:43:41,861
All right?

616
00:43:43,353 --> 00:43:44,650
Shh...

617
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,111
Hang on, where are we going?

618
00:43:51,236 --> 00:43:53,740
Is this not the way
to Sian's family's house?

619
00:43:53,866 --> 00:43:56,118
Er, yeah, I suppose it is.

620
00:43:56,419 --> 00:43:58,496
But the address we're after
is just down here.

621
00:43:58,584 --> 00:44:01,204
Elaine O'Callaghan
lives in the next road down.

622
00:44:02,458 --> 00:44:04,634
Jeez, they're practically neighbours.

623
00:44:24,845 --> 00:44:26,517
Oh, the butter's there, I see.

624
00:44:26,652 --> 00:44:28,322
- Are you ready for a top-up?
- Yeah.

625
00:44:29,439 --> 00:44:31,848
We've just started stripping
the walls and what not, but...

626
00:44:31,936 --> 00:44:33,935
Is there enough...?

627
00:44:34,221 --> 00:44:35,662
Oh, my goodness...!

628
00:44:36,561 --> 00:44:39,017
Calm down,
it's probably the pigging postman.

629
00:44:39,317 --> 00:44:40,674
I'll go.

630
00:44:51,561 --> 00:44:55,079
Hello,
I'm here to speak to Karen Edwards.

631
00:44:58,561 --> 00:45:00,212
I know why you're here.

632
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:02,240
Mrs Edwards, can I come in?

633
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:03,900
Oh, my God...!

634
00:45:04,326 --> 00:45:07,900
It's my daughter, isn't it?
She's... She's the second girl!

635
00:45:08,779 --> 00:45:10,378
Oh, my God...!

636
00:45:11,169 --> 00:45:13,834
- It's her birthday today!
- What's going on?

637
00:45:14,056 --> 00:45:17,523
They're the police.
They're here to tell me that Becky's dead.

638
00:45:17,611 --> 00:45:18,981
Aren't you?

639
00:45:20,781 --> 00:45:21,818
Sorry, yes, I am.

640
00:45:21,906 --> 00:45:23,256
- No! My God!
- Mum?

641
00:45:23,344 --> 00:45:24,474
- Mum?
- Karen!

642
00:45:24,667 --> 00:45:25,706
Steve!

643
00:45:25,856 --> 00:45:27,125
Karen...

644
00:45:29,193 --> 00:45:31,778
It's all right, Mum.
It's all right.

645
00:45:32,305 --> 00:46:32,233
