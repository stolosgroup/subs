1
00:00:07,335 --> 00:00:09,934
This whole series of events

2
00:00:09,935 --> 00:00:13,174
began with a deliberate decision
by a senior officer

3
00:00:13,175 --> 00:00:15,417
to breach the PACE code.

4
00:00:15,442 --> 00:00:16,761
Do you want another one?

5
00:00:16,762 --> 00:00:18,200
Another one?

6
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:23,084
What resulted was not admissible
evidence in a criminal trial.

7
00:00:23,084 --> 00:00:26,226
We should still be OK
with the case against him for Sian.

8
00:00:26,227 --> 00:00:27,639
We have the DNA evidence.

9
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,839
Her blood in his car,
his DNA on her body.

10
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,123
What about Becky?

11
00:00:31,124 --> 00:00:33,639
The confession evidence is all we had.

12
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,479
And, er, I'm afraid, without that,

13
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,679
we'll have to take her name
off the indictment.

14
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,117
Well, this is Fulcher's fault!

15
00:00:40,118 --> 00:00:41,937
Usual deal. None of what we talk about

16
00:00:41,938 --> 00:00:43,679
can be used by ITV
until after the verdict.

17
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,639
Yeah, agreed.

18
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,639
Well, he's a serial killer, Rob.

19
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,089
I am convinced of it.

20
00:00:49,089 --> 00:00:53,427
His big hero was that Myra Hindley
off the Moors Murders.

21
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:56,479
I want to make a complaint
about one of your police officers.

22
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,639
Well, it's a complaint, Steve.

23
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,639
We'll have to decide
whether it constitutes

24
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,446
just misconduct or gross misconduct.

25
00:01:01,447 --> 00:01:03,999
- Really?
- He said they were gunning for him.

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,639
He felt abandoned
by Wiltshire Police, cut adrift.

27
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,639
But where is Becky in the pecking order?

28
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,380
Right down at the bottom,
where she's always been.

29
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,019
So you go back and you tell
your bosses, no, I am not satisfied.

30
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,379
Not at all.

31
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:15,380
I had a word with Mike.

32
00:01:15,381 --> 00:01:18,379
Unfortunately, he's already
referred it to the IPCC.

33
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:20,379
They're going to charge you.

34
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,380
Gross misconduct.

37
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:42,380
- Happy anniversary!
- Oh...

38
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,379
- Thank you very much.
- Happy anniversary, Mum.

39
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:46,580
Happy anniversary, Dad.

40
00:01:47,133 --> 00:01:49,133
Oh, that's lovely!

41
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:52,379
Oh, thank you. That's beautiful.

42
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:55,219
- They helped me choose it. Didn't you?
- Just a little bit.

43
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,380
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

44
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:00,709
Ah-ha!

45
00:02:00,734 --> 00:02:02,734
I've always wanted...

46
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:06,379
It's got a little red light that
flashes if you're too stressed

47
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:09,379
- and you press it too hard.
- Do you think I'm stressed?

48
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:12,379
- Mm, maybe...
- And I thought I was hiding it.

49
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:13,419
[LAUGHTER]

50
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:16,379
- Maybe a little bit.
- Keep out of it, you.

51
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:19,647
- The card's from all three of us.
- Thank you very much.

52
00:02:26,687 --> 00:02:28,379
- We're behind you.
- Thank you.

53
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:31,127
- Happy anniversary.
- Mm-hm.

54
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,727
That helps me a lot, I'll tell you.

55
00:02:35,006 --> 00:02:37,006
We have statements from prostitutes

56
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:40,599
putting Halliwell with Becky
in the lead-up to the murder.

57
00:02:40,624 --> 00:02:42,570
We have the guy he shared a cell with

58
00:02:42,595 --> 00:02:45,588
saying that he liked
to strangle women during sex.

59
00:02:45,589 --> 00:02:46,682
It's all there.

60
00:02:46,683 --> 00:02:49,219
Eight murders,
he told his mate on the phone.

61
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,059
Now, we know about two.

62
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,851
Who's out there
looking for the other six?

63
00:02:52,852 --> 00:02:56,087
It's not me. I'm sat on my arse
on restricted duties.

64
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:00,379
Have they, er, set a date
for your disciplinary hearing?

65
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,220
Before the end of the year.

66
00:03:03,807 --> 00:03:05,380
Meanwhile, I'm in total...

67
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,007
...limbo.

68
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:10,380
No case, no team.

69
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:13,219
The knives are out for me, too.

70
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:15,379
- What?
- Mike Veale suddenly announced to me

71
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:17,379
that he didn't need me
as a staff officer any more.

72
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,136
He thought I'd resign.

73
00:03:19,137 --> 00:03:20,379
I refused to.

74
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:24,379
Then I find this week that
he's appointed a new staff officer.

75
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,899
It's a joke.

76
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,687
I mean, this is my problem.
They can't go after you, too.

77
00:03:30,767 --> 00:03:33,379
I'm going to have this out with them.

78
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,327
Steve, don't. Steve...

79
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:38,399
- Pat, can I have a quick word?
- Steve...

80
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,059
Listen, I know there's a lot of flak
flying around,

81
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:41,379
but it's not fair to...

82
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,379
What's wrong with your phone?
I've been trying to call you.

83
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:45,691
- I had it on charge.
- Mike Veale wants to see you.

84
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:46,937
OK.

85
00:03:46,938 --> 00:03:48,647
I'll tell him you're on your way.

86
00:03:50,587 --> 00:03:52,587
- 25 years Halliwell got.
- That's Karen.

87
00:03:53,443 --> 00:03:56,587
He'll get out, so he'll have
plenty of his life in front of him.

88
00:03:57,587 --> 00:03:59,586
I feel for her, of course I do. But...

89
00:03:59,587 --> 00:04:01,586
Fulcher broke the law.

90
00:04:01,587 --> 00:04:02,587
You know that.

91
00:04:02,588 --> 00:04:05,586
I don't really know what I think
any more, to be honest.

92
00:04:05,587 --> 00:04:09,266
I know I'd rather not get into this
right here and now with Karen.

93
00:04:09,267 --> 00:04:11,088
- I'll sign.
- Oh, thank you.

94
00:04:11,113 --> 00:04:12,793
Thank you very much.

95
00:04:14,947 --> 00:04:17,586
You're actually the first.
That's... It's all my family there.

96
00:04:17,587 --> 00:04:19,587
That's... That's me at the top.

97
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:22,607
Thank you.

98
00:04:30,587 --> 00:04:31,927
25 years...

99
00:04:32,807 --> 00:04:35,167
...Halliwell got. And he'll get out.

100
00:04:39,587 --> 00:04:41,586
- [HE KNOCKS]
- Mike wanted to see me?

101
00:04:41,587 --> 00:04:43,787
Oh, right, Steve. Just a minute.

102
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:49,587
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

103
00:04:50,587 --> 00:04:52,207
[HE CLEARS HIS THROAT]

104
00:04:52,587 --> 00:04:54,587
Mike will see you now.

105
00:04:55,273 --> 00:04:56,273
Thank you.

106
00:04:57,267 --> 00:04:59,106
Hello, Steve. Come in. Sit down.

107
00:04:59,107 --> 00:05:00,426
[DOOR CLOSES]

108
00:05:00,427 --> 00:05:02,587
- Mike. Kier.
- Steve.

109
00:05:03,587 --> 00:05:05,786
I asked DCS Pritchard
to be here this morning

110
00:05:05,787 --> 00:05:07,787
to make a note of everything.

111
00:05:09,967 --> 00:05:12,586
Now, I have to tell you, Steve,
that I am suspending you from duty

112
00:05:12,587 --> 00:05:14,427
with immediate effect.

113
00:05:15,047 --> 00:05:16,586
It's been brought to my attention

114
00:05:16,587 --> 00:05:19,106
that you had an unauthorised meeting
with a member of the press,

115
00:05:19,107 --> 00:05:21,266
the ITV journalist Rob Murphy,

116
00:05:21,267 --> 00:05:23,586
during which you discussed
Operation Mayan.

117
00:05:23,587 --> 00:05:26,587
This is a meeting that you were
expressly forbidden to attend.

118
00:05:28,163 --> 00:05:31,586
An officer from a neighbouring force
happened to be in the pub that night

119
00:05:31,587 --> 00:05:34,586
and witnessed the meeting
and reported it to Kier.

120
00:05:34,587 --> 00:05:36,586
Well, as you know, Steve,
I expressly told you

121
00:05:36,587 --> 00:05:38,807
you're not to do any interviews
with journalists.

122
00:05:41,087 --> 00:05:44,007
I don't recall any conversation
along those lines, Kier.

123
00:05:44,807 --> 00:05:46,586
I mentioned it
at one of the routines recently.

124
00:05:46,587 --> 00:05:47,587
Mm-hm.

125
00:05:48,967 --> 00:05:50,586
Now, I consider this matter
to be serious enough

126
00:05:50,587 --> 00:05:52,587
to warrant immediate suspension.

127
00:05:53,587 --> 00:05:55,927
- Do you have anything to say?
- No, I don't.

128
00:05:58,587 --> 00:06:01,587
Very well, could you please give me
your pass and warrant card?

129
00:06:10,587 --> 00:06:13,586
You will now be escorted
from the premises by Tom,

130
00:06:13,587 --> 00:06:14,971
who's waiting for you outside.

131
00:06:14,972 --> 00:06:16,317
He'll accompany you to your house

132
00:06:16,318 --> 00:06:18,426
to recover any force documents
or property.

133
00:06:18,427 --> 00:06:20,586
Do you understand what I've said to you?

134
00:06:20,587 --> 00:06:21,587
I do.

135
00:06:22,587 --> 00:06:24,946
I'll ask you again
if you have anything to say.

136
00:06:24,947 --> 00:06:26,587
I don't.

137
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:30,333
Fine. That's everything.

138
00:06:47,627 --> 00:06:49,586
Er, I'll take the phone.

139
00:06:49,587 --> 00:06:52,587
- Can I at least call my wife?
- I'm afraid not.

140
00:06:58,587 --> 00:07:00,587
Oh, could I have that, please, sir?

141
00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:29,979
Are you coming in?

142
00:07:44,587 --> 00:07:46,267
Oh, it's Steve.

143
00:07:47,587 --> 00:07:49,586
Maughan and Ned are here.

144
00:07:49,587 --> 00:07:52,266
- Er, where's the laptop, please?
- What's going on?

145
00:07:52,267 --> 00:07:54,586
It's in the kitchen on the dining table.

146
00:07:54,587 --> 00:07:56,710
Would you accompany me in there, please?

147
00:07:56,735 --> 00:07:58,541
- Steve...?
- I've been suspended.

148
00:07:58,542 --> 00:08:01,267
What?! My mum and dad are in there.
Can I get it for you?

149
00:08:02,267 --> 00:08:03,587
I'm sorry.

150
00:08:06,587 --> 00:08:08,426
Hi, folks. Hello.

151
00:08:08,427 --> 00:08:09,587
- Hi, Steve.
- Hello.

152
00:08:14,587 --> 00:08:16,586
- Is this it?
- Yes.

153
00:08:16,587 --> 00:08:19,087
- Everything all right?
- Yes, it's a work thing.

154
00:08:30,534 --> 00:08:33,013
And she was going round
all of the toilets in the school

155
00:08:33,014 --> 00:08:35,485
and she slid under all the doors,
locked them,

156
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:38,309
and then slid back out again
so that all the doors,

157
00:08:38,334 --> 00:08:40,333
all the toilets in the whole school
were locked.

158
00:08:40,334 --> 00:08:41,294
- How stupid.
- Mm, goodness.

159

for her to get expelled,

she's got good grades.

deal, it's just a joke.

who was here last week?

164

- She's not really bitchy.
- Yes, she is.

Don't worry.

Er, would you like to come through?

Thank you for coming to see me,

The IPCC is an independent body

172
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:28,813
that's been set up to examine
complaints against the police.

173
00:09:28,814 --> 00:09:32,813
I've asked you to come and see me
today to discuss a complaint

174
00:09:32,814 --> 00:09:36,333
that has been made against the
officer leading the investigation

175

into the murder of your daughter Rebecca.

176
00:09:38,254 --> 00:09:40,377
Against Steve Fulcher?

177
00:09:40,377 --> 00:09:43,376
Detective Superintendent Fulcher,
that's correct.

178
00:09:43,377 --> 00:09:46,376
I wanted to know if you wanted
to add your name

179
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:47,639
to the complaint against him.

180
00:09:49,377 --> 00:09:51,737
Who's made this complaint?

181
00:09:52,119 --> 00:09:54,376
Rebecca's father, John Godden.

182
00:09:54,377 --> 00:09:56,376
You're joking! John?!

183
00:09:56,377 --> 00:09:58,376
Oh, you've got to be kidding! That's...

184
00:09:58,377 --> 00:09:59,759
Have you met John Godden?

185
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:02,376
All complaints about the police

186
00:10:02,377 --> 00:10:04,878
must be dealt with without prejudice.

187
00:10:04,903 --> 00:10:08,056
And it has been deemed that
the points Mr Godden has raised

188
00:10:08,057 --> 00:10:10,376
are serious enough
to warrant an investigation.

189
00:10:10,377 --> 00:10:13,376
Specifically, Detective
Superintendent Fulcher's failure

190
00:10:13,377 --> 00:10:15,625
to apply the rules of PACE

191
00:10:15,626 --> 00:10:19,168
to his interview with the chief
suspect Christopher Halliwell

192
00:10:19,169 --> 00:10:21,601
and prevented justice for his daughter.

193
00:10:21,602 --> 00:10:25,056
But if it wasn't for Steve Fulcher
we'd never have found our daughter.

194
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:26,627
So, how does he work that one out?

195
00:10:26,628 --> 00:10:29,376
So, you don't agree
with your ex-husband's view

196
00:10:29,377 --> 00:10:32,029
about Chief Superintendent Fulcher's
conduct?

197
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:33,836
No. We bloody don't.

198
00:10:33,837 --> 00:10:36,376
If Mrs Edwards could answer
the question, please.

199
00:10:36,377 --> 00:10:37,973
No, I bloody well don't!

We've got to help him, Charlie.

We can't leave him
to be thrown to the wolves.

You know, I'm sure it suits them

203
00:10:42,378 --> 00:10:44,063
to make out he's the one that messed up.

204
00:10:44,064 --> 00:10:46,003
You know, "It's not us, it's him."

But you can't take on everyone, Karen.

But the man who murdered Becky
has got away with it.

- How do you work that one out?
- Come on, love, get in.

No, justice for Steve
is justice for Becky.

It's only a bloody can of Coke.

He just had to ask first.

00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:21,377
And I have told him that
time and time again.

213
00:11:24,377 --> 00:11:26,873
He has no male role model in his life.

Not just so Becky gets justice,
but cos the police officer involved,

Detective Superintendent Fulcher,
because it's not fair

that he should be facing

- Karen, not all at once.

You're bombarding the man.

Sorry. It's just, once I start, I...

...I find it hard to stop.

But what I wanted to say,
and I know you're a lawyer yourself,

00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:12,377
is I think there's a grey area here
with PACE.

00:13:12,999 --> 00:13:14,377
I agree.

249

You agree?

00:13:17,377 --> 00:13:18,377
Yes.

251
00:13:18,378 --> 00:13:20,759
Yeah, I think PACE does need
to be looked at.

You've started a petition?

Yes, we've got over 7,000 signatures
so far.

256
00:13:29,377 --> 00:13:32,376
Right, you need to get that number
up as high as you possibly can.

257
00:13:32,377 --> 00:13:33,377
If I'm to lobby the Government,

258
00:13:33,378 --> 00:13:35,376
the higher the number,
the more they'll take notice.

259
00:13:35,377 --> 00:13:38,376
And you also need to keep on doing
your radio and TV interviews

260

whenever you get the chance.

You see, the more the campaign
features in the press,

262
00:13:43,377 --> 00:13:45,472
the likelihood increases
that the Government

263
00:13:45,473 --> 00:13:48,376
could ask Wiltshire Police Service
some awkward questions.

264

Oh, right.

Malfeasance is about abuse of office.

Trying to find Sian alive

284

of a missing girl isn't malfeasance.

who is the victim?

286

00:16:04,377 --> 00:16:06,377
of suspects by police officers.

316
00:16:07,377 --> 00:16:11,376
PACE is nearly 30 years old and it
was brought in because of concerns

317
00:16:11,377 --> 00:16:14,101
over the way the police were
behaving with people in custody.

318
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:16,022
Which I understand.

319
00:16:16,377 --> 00:16:18,376
But what Steve Fulcher faced

320
00:16:18,377 --> 00:16:20,576
were a very, very unusual
set of circumstances.

321
00:16:20,577 --> 00:16:24,056
And I feel
there should be more flexibility

322
00:16:24,081 --> 00:16:27,543
when police officers arrest people
in situations like that.

323
00:16:28,719 --> 00:16:31,376
Because I don't want anybody else
to suffer

324
00:16:31,408 --> 00:16:33,408
what we have been through as a family.

325
00:16:35,305 --> 00:16:37,305
Thank you. Thank you very much.

326
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:55,181
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

327
00:16:55,206 --> 00:16:56,366
See you soon.

328
00:17:05,377 --> 00:17:07,376
Excuse me, it's Karen, isn't it?
I'm Yvonne.

329
00:17:07,377 --> 00:17:09,376
Steve's wife. I just want to say hello.

330
00:17:09,377 --> 00:17:11,376
Oh, how lovely to meet you.

331
00:17:11,377 --> 00:17:13,376
This is my husband Charlie.

332
00:17:13,377 --> 00:17:15,376
I am so sorry
Steve's having to go through this.

333
00:17:15,377 --> 00:17:17,856
In my opinion, it's an absolute disgrace

334
00:17:17,857 --> 00:17:20,376
and please don't think
we had anything to do with it.

335
00:17:20,377 --> 00:17:22,376
This is all down to him. And when
I heard he'd made a complaint,

336
00:17:22,377 --> 00:17:24,376
after all Steve has done for us,

337
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:26,376
I could have wrung his neck.

338
00:17:26,377 --> 00:17:28,759
Nice to meet you.
Erm, I was going to go outside.

339
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,216
- I'm not allowed to stay in here.
- Oh, that's ridiculous.

340
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:33,376
Don't you worry, love.
We'll look after him.

341
00:17:33,377 --> 00:17:34,377
Thanks.

342
00:17:40,134 --> 00:17:41,174
Good morning, everyone.

343
00:17:41,174 --> 00:17:43,654
I am Chief Constable Andy Parker
from Warwickshire Police

344
00:17:43,655 --> 00:17:45,054
and I'll be chairing this hearing.

345
00:17:45,054 --> 00:17:47,461
There are some of you
that I haven't met before.

346
00:17:47,462 --> 00:17:49,661
I wonder if we can begin
by you telling us your names?

347
00:17:49,662 --> 00:17:52,461
Anna Proctor, IPCC.

348
00:17:52,462 --> 00:17:53,462
Thank you.

349
00:17:53,463 --> 00:17:56,314
- The gentleman at the back?
- Er...

350
00:17:56,792 --> 00:17:59,112
My name is John Godden.

351
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,380
Father of Rebecca Godden.

352
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:06,564
David Godden, John's brother.

353
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:11,375
Karen Edwards,
mother of Rebecca Godden-Edwards.

354
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,107
Could you just hang on a minute,
cos I...?

355
00:18:14,132 --> 00:18:15,465
I think I'm on the wrong side here.

356
00:18:15,502 --> 00:18:18,030
Cos I don't want to be associated
with this lot.

357
00:18:18,031 --> 00:18:20,083
Because we're here
to support Steve Fulcher.

358
00:18:20,084 --> 00:18:22,142
So, were going to... Come on, Charlie.

359
00:18:23,815 --> 00:18:24,815
Thank you.

360
00:18:27,462 --> 00:18:29,684
Thank you. Carry on.

361
00:18:34,462 --> 00:18:36,461
The first allegation concerns a complaint

362
00:18:36,462 --> 00:18:38,461
brought against you by Mr Godden.

363
00:18:38,462 --> 00:18:40,461
It is alleged that your behaviour,

364
00:18:40,462 --> 00:18:43,960
when dealing with Mr Halliwell
on 24th March, 2011,

365
00:18:43,961 --> 00:18:46,853
fell below the standards
of professional behaviour

366
00:18:46,854 --> 00:18:49,462
required of an officer of your standing.

367
00:18:50,815 --> 00:18:52,815
Do you admit or deny the allegation?

368
00:18:53,884 --> 00:18:55,502
I deny the allegation.

369
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,437
Allegation two.

370
00:18:57,462 --> 00:19:00,461
It is alleged by your employer,
Wiltshire Police,

371
00:19:00,462 --> 00:19:03,502
that, by having inappropriate
contact with the media,

372
00:19:03,804 --> 00:19:07,461
your conduct again fell below
the same standards.

373
00:19:07,462 --> 00:19:09,461
Do you admit or deny the allegation?

374
00:19:09,462 --> 00:19:10,981
I deny the allegation.

375
00:19:10,982 --> 00:19:14,461
The provisions of PACE are quite
clear, Mr Fulcher.

376
00:19:14,462 --> 00:19:16,628
I mean, they're there to protect
the rights of all of us.

377
00:19:16,629 --> 00:19:18,744
- Yes.
- Yet, you did not caution

378
00:19:18,769 --> 00:19:21,301
Christopher Halliwell
as the law dictates.

379
00:19:21,302 --> 00:19:22,461
Now, why not?

380
00:19:22,462 --> 00:19:24,462
Because I felt it was disingenuous

381
00:19:25,124 --> 00:19:29,739
to begin an interview with Halliwell
in those circumstances by saying,

382
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:30,981
"You don't have to say anything."

383
00:19:30,982 --> 00:19:33,141
I felt his right to silence

384
00:19:33,142 --> 00:19:35,462
directly conflicted
with Sian's right to life.

385
00:19:36,462 --> 00:19:38,977
Er, a little while later,
Halliwell says to you,

386
00:19:38,978 --> 00:19:42,301
"Do you want another one?" Now, what
did you understand this to mean?

387
00:19:42,302 --> 00:19:45,461
It wasn't actually clear, initially,
what it meant.

388
00:19:45,462 --> 00:19:47,461
Well, if it wasn't clear,
wouldn't it have been better

389
00:19:47,462 --> 00:19:49,070
to arrest him for Sian, caution him,

390
00:19:49,071 --> 00:19:51,461
and then clarify things on the other
one back at the police station?

391
00:19:51,462 --> 00:19:53,461
But they wouldn't have been
clarified, would they?

392
00:19:53,462 --> 00:19:56,461
His solicitor would've advised him
to go, "No comment,"

393
00:19:56,462 --> 00:19:58,651
- and that would've been that.
- Not necessarily.

394
00:19:58,652 --> 00:20:00,461
He could've been properly cautioned,
brought back to the station

395
00:20:00,462 --> 00:20:02,764
and then revealed
the victim's whereabouts.

396
00:20:03,462 --> 00:20:05,501
That's the difference between
theory and practice.

397
00:20:05,502 --> 00:20:08,461
I mean, in practice,
that has never happened.

398
00:20:08,462 --> 00:20:09,821
Not once, in my whole career.

399
00:20:09,822 --> 00:20:12,795
Now, if you had arrested him
and cautioned him at that point,

400
00:20:12,796 --> 00:20:14,301
then everything that followed

401
00:20:14,302 --> 00:20:15,821
would have remained admissible
in evidence.

402
00:20:15,822 --> 00:20:19,141
Not to do so was a gross error
of judgment on your part, wasn't it?

403
00:20:19,142 --> 00:20:20,462
I don't believe it was, no.

404
00:20:25,399 --> 00:20:29,461
I feel like a madman in a roomful
of people who don't understand me.

405
00:20:29,462 --> 00:20:33,142
I'm saying the same thing over and
over again and nobody's listening.

406
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:53,187
Mr Geenty, you've always supported
Steve Fulcher's reasoning

407
00:20:53,212 --> 00:20:55,759
for not cautioning
Christopher Halliwell, haven't you?

408
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,559
I have no doubt about his good faith
that day.

409
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,559
Yes, but his judgment, his reasoning.

410
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:05,559
At the pre-trial hearing, before the
Sian O'Callaghan trial, you said,

411
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:09,194
"I think the decision Steve made was,

412
00:21:09,195 --> 00:21:12,893
"to use the slang, a gutsy decision.

413
00:21:12,894 --> 00:21:15,559
"And I'd like to think
I would make a similar decision

414
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,559
"in the same circumstances."

415
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,559
Well, that was when he was still hoping

416
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,399
that Sian might be found alive.

417
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,559
We all were.

418
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,559
But I disagree with his judgment

419
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:27,560
when it came to him being offered
information about the second body.

420
00:21:28,762 --> 00:21:32,559
That is where I think PACE
and the protection of the suspect

421
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,559
would have become paramount

422
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,559
because tragically, at that point,
when he knew Sian was dead,

423
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:40,559
the urgent interview provision
no longer applied.

424
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:43,857
So you agree with his actions in
relation to Sian, but not to Becky?

425
00:21:43,858 --> 00:21:47,559
No, I believe, at that point,
in the heat of the moment,

426
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,242
he could not have been thinking clearly.

427
00:21:49,243 --> 00:21:52,002
So what are you saying, then?
That Becky doesn't matter?

428
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:56,535
Would it be fair to say
that Steve Fulcher

429
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:00,399
was by far the most experienced SIO
that Wiltshire had

430
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,559
at the point of the Sian and Becky
investigation?

431
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:05,902
Steve has demonstrated
that he has a solid track record.

432
00:22:05,903 --> 00:22:08,559
And that,
whatever else this case is about,

433
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:12,559
there is no doubt that he is an
outstandingly good police officer.

434
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,992
He is a very competent officer, yes.

435
00:22:14,993 --> 00:22:17,919
Now, in spite of the fact that
it's normal for senior officers

436
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,559
to give off-the-record media briefings,

437
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,559
you say you had a conversation
with Steve Fulcher

438
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:27,134
to tell him of an order by the then
Deputy Chief Constable Geenty

439
00:22:27,135 --> 00:22:29,559
that he wasn't to do any interviews
with journalists.

440
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,919
That is correct, yes.

441
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:33,759
You made an entry into your diary
that day, didn't you?

442
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,249
You record 16 points

443
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:38,599
relating to various matters
you'd discussed with him.

444
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,559
But the one thing you haven't recorded

445
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,264
is any mention of Steve Fulcher

446
00:22:43,265 --> 00:22:45,051
being told not to speak to the media.

447
00:22:45,052 --> 00:22:47,759
I spoke to Steve Fulcher
about DCC Geenty's order

448
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,202
at the end of the conversation.

449
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,559
Those other points were from
the first part of the conversation.

450
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,559
But surely, Mr Geenty's order

451
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:58,559
would've been the most important
part of that conversation,

452
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,759
based on the fact that Steve Fulcher
stands here today

453
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,559
with the prospect
of losing his career because of it?

454
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,559
I didn't feel it necessary
to have recorded

455
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,560
that part of the conversation.

456
00:23:07,561 --> 00:23:10,202
But I can assure you that it did happen.

457
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,559
Is this actually misconduct at all?

458
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:16,799
In both instances, the failure
to caution Christopher Halliwell

459
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,559
and the interviews Detective
Superintendent Fulcher

460
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,144
gave to the media,

461
00:23:21,145 --> 00:23:23,312
might not many members of the public say,

462
00:23:23,313 --> 00:23:27,967
"Surely, there are better ways
for the police service and the IPCC

463
00:23:27,968 --> 00:23:29,559
"to deal with such matters?

464
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:32,559
"Are you really satisfied,
based on the evidence before you,

465
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:35,935
"that you could take the steps
to remove this man's career?"

466
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,240
- Thank you, Mr Beggs.
- Are there any questions

467
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,372
from Rebecca's family members
present today?

468
00:23:40,372 --> 00:23:43,800
Well, not from me.
I'm very happy with how it's gone.

469
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:47,619
- Mrs Edwards?
- I agree with Mr Beggs.

470
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:51,619
It seems ridiculous all this
public money's been spent on this.

471
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:53,139
Thank you, both.

472
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:56,014
Well, we shall now retire
to consider our judgment.

473
00:23:56,015 --> 00:23:58,619
You will be informed of our verdict
in due course,

474
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,619
when this hearing will reconvene.

475
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:01,782
Thank you.

476
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:36,511
MAN: Come on, you reds!

477
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:48,360
My sister got in a cab with him.

478
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,039
- With Halliwell?
- Yeah.

479
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:53,359
She seen his picture in the paper
and she was sure it was him.

480
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,359
She gets in his cab
and he drives her the wrong way,

481
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:59,359
out towards Savernake Forest,
acting all weird, like.

482
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,199
She screams and opens the door
and someone sees them.

483
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,989
And he pulls over and lets her out.

484
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:06,359
Says he was just having a laugh with her.

485
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:09,562
- She doesn't know how lucky she is.
- Yeah, that's what my mum says.

486
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,842
All right, thank you. Thank you.

487
00:25:14,722 --> 00:25:17,359
We just wanted to check that you were OK.

488
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,360
See if you had any worries or questions.

489
00:25:19,722 --> 00:25:22,360
Thank you. It's much appreciated.

490
00:25:23,887 --> 00:25:27,308
I don't know if you're aware
of what Karen Edwards is doing.

491
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,762
She's got a petition going.

492
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,400
I'm aware of it, yeah.

493
00:25:32,425 --> 00:25:36,615
Her support for Stephen Fulcher
is very commendable, but...

494
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,756
...Wiltshire Police Service feel it is...

495
00:25:39,884 --> 00:25:41,244
...misguided.

496
00:25:41,723 --> 00:25:45,043
Our position is that Fulcher
shouldn't have breached PACE.

497
00:25:46,948 --> 00:25:48,586
Yeah, that's how we feel.

498
00:25:49,909 --> 00:25:52,067
We would have found Sian's body anyway.

499
00:25:52,685 --> 00:25:54,005
That's good to know.

500
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:59,559
We've heard from Karen's FLO
that she would like to meet you.

501
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,359
Would you be interested
in us arranging that?

502
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,360
No, I wouldn't. Thank you.

503
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,562
After she got in the car with him...

504
00:26:08,682 --> 00:26:11,200
...I keep wondering
what happened to her after that.

505
00:26:13,813 --> 00:26:16,453
I torment myself
wondering if it was quick.

506
00:26:19,802 --> 00:26:21,360
Erm...

507
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:26,960
He pleaded guilty, so we didn't have
to give a detailed account in court.

508
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,199
Or at least...

509
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,682
...one that we could challenge.

510
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,359
Did she know
what he was going to do with her?

511
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,360
Was she frightened?

512
00:26:37,893 --> 00:26:40,533
Halliwell said that he killed her
quickly.

513
00:26:41,613 --> 00:26:43,613
Within a few minutes of setting off.

514
00:26:44,607 --> 00:26:47,127
She started struggling,
so he stabbed her.

515
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,360
Erm...

516
00:26:51,832 --> 00:26:53,792
I don't know if I believe him.

517
00:26:57,430 --> 00:26:59,750
She wasn't wearing her boots
when you found her.

518
00:27:00,435 --> 00:27:01,795
They were tight-fitting.

519
00:27:03,884 --> 00:27:05,602
When did they come off? Did...?

520
00:27:06,091 --> 00:27:07,771
Did he start to undress her?

521
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:21,360
I just keep playing it
over and over in my head.

522
00:27:25,893 --> 00:27:29,133
Different scenarios and...

523
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,360
...I just see her face, Pete.

524
00:27:36,842 --> 00:27:38,360
Terrified.

525
00:27:41,642 --> 00:27:42,980
Come here...

526
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,360
It's OK.

527
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,759
Come here.

528
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:48,719
Shh...

[HE SIGHS]

I want to look after you, Elaine.

I'm here for you, all right?

532
00:28:03,926 --> 00:28:08,128
Everything that's happened has
just made me want to protect you.

Why don't you pack it in at work?

534
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:20,832
You hate that fucking job.

535
00:28:22,421 --> 00:28:23,743
I can support you.

00:28:29,414 --> 00:28:31,936
I want us to be together properly,

537
00:28:36,793 --> 00:28:37,793
Mm.

538
00:28:50,689 --> 00:28:53,367
I have asked you not to smoke inside.

539
00:29:07,246 --> 00:29:09,886
- Why don't you have a shower?
- [HE SCOFFS]

540
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,946
Why don't you have a nice shower
and we could go to Brighton?

541
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:15,440
The girls are out tonight.

542
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,200
We could have lunch
and we wouldn't have to rush back.

543
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,513
Do I smell, Yvonne?

544
00:29:18,995 --> 00:29:20,512
- What?
- Or do I stink?

545
00:29:20,513 --> 00:29:22,513
Can you smell me from there?

546
00:29:22,835 --> 00:29:24,512
I don't know what you're talking about.

547
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:25,712
Oh, obfuscation.

548
00:29:25,713 --> 00:29:27,512
I can tell from your answer,

549
00:29:27,513 --> 00:29:29,513
or, more accurately, your...

550
00:29:29,875 --> 00:29:32,513
...lack of an answer, that I don't.
Therefore...

551
00:29:33,035 --> 00:29:34,512
...no need for me to shower.

552
00:29:34,513 --> 00:29:35,955
Is this you being funny?

553
00:29:37,513 --> 00:29:40,112
Anyway, I'm not allowed
to leave the county

554
00:29:40,113 --> 00:29:41,512
without getting permission from them.

555
00:29:41,513 --> 00:29:43,006
- You're joking?
- It's true.

556
00:29:43,007 --> 00:29:45,235
I have to ask them
if I can leave Wiltshire.

557
00:29:49,513 --> 00:29:50,513
Well...

558
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:53,033
OK.

559
00:30:01,805 --> 00:30:05,512
What has happened to Steve Fulcher
is nothing short of scandalous.

560
00:30:05,513 --> 00:30:09,192
Cos, without him, my daughter
would be lying in a field somewhere

561
00:30:09,193 --> 00:30:11,512
without anyone knowing where she was.

562
00:30:11,513 --> 00:30:13,906
But he has been hounded
from pillar to post

563
00:30:13,907 --> 00:30:16,241
while Christopher Halliwell,
who murdered her,

564
00:30:16,242 --> 00:30:18,512
has never faced justice for what he did.

565
00:30:18,513 --> 00:30:21,512
Our Justice For Becky campaign
is petitioning the Government

566
00:30:21,513 --> 00:30:22,552
to change the PACE law.

567
00:30:22,553 --> 00:30:26,512
So, please, sign our petition
if you see us around Swindon.

568
00:30:26,513 --> 00:30:27,513
Not ideal.

569
00:30:27,514 --> 00:30:29,993
What, are you worried about a backlash

570
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:33,512
if Karen Edwards' support for Steve
Fulcher gains too much momentum?

571
00:30:33,513 --> 00:30:36,512
Because, I have to admit,
it has crossed my mind.

572
00:30:36,513 --> 00:30:38,772
It's not great, from a PR point of view.

573
00:30:38,797 --> 00:30:39,910
No.

574
00:30:39,911 --> 00:30:43,192
Maybe we should have another think
about the investigation.

575
00:30:43,193 --> 00:30:44,286
Yeah.

576
00:30:44,287 --> 00:30:47,032
I know we bicker, I know he can be...

577
00:30:47,033 --> 00:30:48,512
...controlling.

578
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:49,553
But...

579
00:30:50,035 --> 00:30:51,513
...he can be so sweet.

580
00:30:53,193 --> 00:30:54,512
He's picked me up when I was down.

581
00:30:54,513 --> 00:30:56,712
He's been there for me
all through this. He's been my rock.

582
00:30:56,713 --> 00:30:59,033
He did force you to get that lump
on your boob checked.

583
00:30:59,034 --> 00:31:00,512
I will give him that.

584
00:31:00,513 --> 00:31:03,512
And just when I think
he's exactly what I need,

585
00:31:03,513 --> 00:31:06,192
things happen and I wonder if he is.

586
00:31:06,193 --> 00:31:08,512
We've had another row
because he says Aiden

587
00:31:08,513 --> 00:31:11,512
took a can of Coke
out of the fridge without asking.

588
00:31:11,513 --> 00:31:13,513
Really? A can of Coke?

589
00:31:14,573 --> 00:31:15,835
That's the, er...

590
00:31:16,713 --> 00:31:19,513
...the police at Karen's.
I wonder what they're there for.

591
00:31:21,193 --> 00:31:22,513
She asked to meet me, Karen.

592
00:31:23,513 --> 00:31:25,715
- What did you say?
- No.

593
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,762
I can't face her. I know I should, but...

594
00:31:31,513 --> 00:31:33,513
I can't really explain it.

595
00:31:34,439 --> 00:31:36,211
We have come across so many people

596
00:31:36,212 --> 00:31:38,290
who have given us information
on Halliwell.

597
00:31:38,291 --> 00:31:40,123
People who say
they got into his taxi with him

598
00:31:40,124 --> 00:31:41,552
and had scary experiences.

599
00:31:41,553 --> 00:31:44,986
People saying he got obsessed
with women and would stalk them.

600
00:31:44,987 --> 00:31:47,735
People who can link him to girls
who have gone missing.

601
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,512
But it's all hearsay, Karen.

602
00:31:49,513 --> 00:31:52,295
People say they know someone who knew him

603
00:31:52,296 --> 00:31:54,512
or people who've heard something
about him

604
00:31:54,513 --> 00:31:56,201
and not seen it for themselves.

605
00:31:56,202 --> 00:31:58,715
Nothing that would stand up in court.

606
00:32:00,433 --> 00:32:03,433
I'm sorry, but trying to play
amateur detective

607
00:32:03,458 --> 00:32:07,196
and criticising Wiltshire Police
in the media is not helping things.

608
00:32:07,221 --> 00:32:08,523
It's not all critical.

609
00:32:08,553 --> 00:32:12,914
I always tell everybody what
a fantastic job Steve Fulcher did.

610
00:32:12,915 --> 00:32:14,512
And he is a Wiltshire
police officer, isn't he?

611
00:32:14,513 --> 00:32:16,094
We're all in this together.

612
00:32:16,451 --> 00:32:19,008
Now, I was speaking to Sian's mum
Elaine the other day

613
00:32:19,033 --> 00:32:21,352
and she was saying the same thing.

614
00:32:21,353 --> 00:32:22,513
It's a team effort.

615
00:32:22,875 --> 00:32:26,512
Did you tell her I'd asked to meet her?

616
00:32:26,513 --> 00:32:28,513
- I did.
- And what did she say?

617
00:32:30,373 --> 00:32:31,373
Er...

618
00:32:31,513 --> 00:32:34,513
She says it's not the right time
for her at the moment.

619
00:32:40,427 --> 00:32:42,427
Well, my door is always open.

620
00:32:45,513 --> 00:32:47,512
When you spoke to the psychiatrist

621
00:32:47,513 --> 00:32:49,960
about those feelings of rage,
Christopher,

622
00:32:49,961 --> 00:32:52,512
of being consumed by a single thought,

623
00:32:52,513 --> 00:32:55,755
did he talk about finding
a harmless release mechanism?

624
00:32:56,726 --> 00:33:00,366
For example, to think of something
that calms us down.

625
00:33:00,786 --> 00:33:03,042
Well, I told him I liked to go fishing.

626
00:33:04,513 --> 00:33:06,513
I used to love sitting there
for hours on end.

627
00:33:07,715 --> 00:33:09,513
I find it very peaceful.

628
00:33:09,915 --> 00:33:11,513
And that's good.

629
00:33:12,513 --> 00:33:13,713
Yeah.

630
00:33:13,955 --> 00:33:16,513
I had this special place
where I liked to fish.

631
00:33:16,842 --> 00:33:18,520
Out in the woods.

632
00:33:19,447 --> 00:33:21,447
It was like my own private...

633
00:33:21,513 --> 00:33:23,513
I don't know what you'd call it.
A sanctum.

634
00:33:24,395 --> 00:33:25,513
Yeah.

635
00:33:26,915 --> 00:33:28,513
I used to love going there.

636
00:33:29,513 --> 00:33:31,315
My special place.

637
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,900
[DOOR CLOSES]

638
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,240
The panel feels that

639
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,358
the continuation of custody
of Christopher Halliwell

640
00:33:58,359 --> 00:34:00,700
without caution or without any
of the other safeguards

641
00:34:00,701 --> 00:34:02,540
afforded him by PACE,

642
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:05,495
particularly when en route
to the location of Rebecca Godden,

643
00:34:05,496 --> 00:34:06,700
cannot be justified.

644
00:34:06,701 --> 00:34:10,060
At such time as it became apparent
that Sian O'Callaghan was dead,

645
00:34:10,061 --> 00:34:12,311
you should have stopped the car,
turned it around

646
00:34:12,312 --> 00:34:14,380
and taken Halliwell into custody.

647
00:34:14,381 --> 00:34:17,141
And the panel has a wider duty to perform

648
00:34:17,142 --> 00:34:19,700
in respect to public confidence,

649
00:34:19,701 --> 00:34:22,290
and the message needs to be sent
to other officers

650
00:34:22,291 --> 00:34:25,700
that a detective cannot ignore PACE
to such an extent

651
00:34:25,701 --> 00:34:28,380
without being held fully to account.

652
00:34:28,381 --> 00:34:31,543
And we regard your conduct
as gross misconduct.

653
00:34:32,541 --> 00:34:35,700
On allegation two,
the panel concludes that,

654
00:34:35,701 --> 00:34:37,700
on the balance of probability,

655
00:34:37,701 --> 00:34:41,060
you were given an instruction
by Chief Superintendent Pritchard

656
00:34:41,061 --> 00:34:42,700
to not give interviews to the media.

657
00:34:42,701 --> 00:34:45,257
This is not behaviour we would
expect from a senior officer

658
00:34:45,288 --> 00:34:47,731
and we regard the conduct
as gross misconduct.

659
00:34:49,171 --> 00:34:51,346
These breaches would justify dismissal.

660
00:34:52,701 --> 00:34:55,700
However, taking into account
your previous exemplary record,

661
00:34:55,725 --> 00:34:58,967
the panel has concluded that
the most appropriate sanction...

662
00:34:59,701 --> 00:35:01,701
...is a final written warning.

663
00:35:05,372 --> 00:35:09,700
And I cannot stress how close
you came to losing your job today.

664
00:35:09,701 --> 00:35:12,700
I do hope that you have learnt
from this experience.

665
00:35:12,701 --> 00:35:14,540
It's not right what Fulcher did!

666
00:35:14,541 --> 00:35:17,542
Why should we have to pay with
our pain because of his mistakes?

667
00:35:17,543 --> 00:35:19,701
I've been mentally scarred by this.

668
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,851
It seems to me, come to Swindon
and commit a murder

669
00:35:23,876 --> 00:35:25,265
cos you'll get away with it.

670
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:28,920
I will never trust the police again.

671
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:31,140
Never.

672
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,720
I can start back as soon as possible.

673
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:35,951
And you're actually going to?

674
00:36:35,952 --> 00:36:37,580
Well, what else am I going to do?

675
00:36:37,952 --> 00:36:40,500
I'm a police officer. It's all I...

676
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,639
It's all I know, Yvonne!

677
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:46,639
- And I am fucking good at it!
- Good for you, Steve!

678
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,188
Fuck everyone else!

679
00:37:05,108 --> 00:37:06,839
We're very pleased
to have you here, Steve.

680
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,159
Thank you.

681
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,639
- You knew Ray Hayward, is that right?
- Er, yes.

682
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,640
Yes, I liked Ray.

683
00:37:11,641 --> 00:37:14,479
I met him many times in meetings.

684
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,748
He always had an interesting take
on things, you know.

685
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,320
Here we are.

686
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,639
Now, when the word went round
that you were available,

687
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:28,215
our previous Bobby Van manager
has just retired.

688
00:37:28,216 --> 00:37:29,409
Mm-hm.

689
00:37:29,434 --> 00:37:32,007
- You're obviously a bit overqualified...
- What exactly is Bobby Van?

690
00:37:32,008 --> 00:37:33,839
It's a local initiative to get a van out

691
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:36,639
to burglary and criminal damage victims

692
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,639
to get their windows and doors
and suchlike fixed up.

693
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,639
Mm-hm. Right.

694
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,319
Well, I'll...

695
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,640
I'll leave you to it.

696
00:37:44,948 --> 00:37:46,639
Give you a chance
to get up to speed on everything.

697
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,640
- Thank you.
- OK.

[REPORTERS SHOUT QUESTIONS]

699

This is about justice for Becky.

700
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:04,077
And justice for a brave police officer,

701
00:38:04,078 --> 00:38:07,639
whose career has been ruined
just for doing his job.

702
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:11,639
And over 40,000 people
have signed our petition,

703
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:14,640
and with the help of our local MP

704
00:38:15,068 --> 00:38:17,679
we are delighted
to be able to deliver our demand

705
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:21,639
for a change in the law
directly to Mr Cameron.

706
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:25,348
And this must never be allowed
to happen again.

707
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:29,999
Will my Right Honourable friend
join our cause for a thorough review

708
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,319
of Code C of
the Police And Criminal Evidence Act

709
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:37,639
so that terrible situations
like this will not happen again?

710
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:40,639
I will look very carefully at what
my honourable friend has raised

711
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,999
and the specific case that he mentions,

712
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,639
and look also at this issue

713
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,467
of the Police And Criminal Evidence Act.

714
00:38:46,468 --> 00:38:49,020
It is always important
that all information

715
00:38:49,021 --> 00:38:52,639
that possibly can be put in front of
a court is put in front of the court

716
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,639
so the court can reach the correct, er...

717
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,320
...the correct decision.

718
00:38:59,806 --> 00:39:02,639
I want you to know
that it's OK to feel happy again.

719
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:06,639
That, if something good happens,
it's OK to smile

720
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,639
or feel good inside.

721
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,160
It's not betraying Sian
to feel like that.

722
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,639
Me and Pete have decided...

723
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,639
...that we make each other happy.

724
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,640
So, we're going to get married.

725
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:26,559
And I wanted to tell you before
anyone else,

726
00:39:26,584 --> 00:39:28,584
so you can tell me how you feel about it.

727
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:32,640
If it's what you want.

728
00:39:32,641 --> 00:39:35,068
- Mm.
- I'm happy for you.

729
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,148
Aiden?

730
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,640
I'm glad that you want to marry Pete.

731
00:39:42,272 --> 00:39:44,272
I just want you to be happy, Mum.

- Mm-hm.

739
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,640
...my pension will be cut.

740
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,480
- We wouldn't have enough to live on.
- I don't care.

741
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:14,640
Good to see you.

742
00:41:14,641 --> 00:41:16,640
So, this is where we are. Erm...

743
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,639
Well, Mr Cameron was true to his word

744
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:22,159
and he referred this to Theresa May,
the Home Secretary.

745
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,429
Excellent.

746
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:26,639
And she referred it to Damian Green,
the Policing Secretary.

747
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,639
And he passed it on to ACPO,

748
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,639
the Association of Chief Police Officers.

749
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,639
- Right.
- And they asked for comments

750
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,639
from the relevant police service,
Wiltshire.

751
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,639
Then they went back to Damian Green
with their recommendation

752
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:40,148
for no action required.

753
00:41:42,406 --> 00:41:44,406
They advise that Section 11 of PACE

754
00:41:44,431 --> 00:41:47,431
is only applicable to a threat
to life and the recovery of evidence

755
00:41:47,456 --> 00:41:49,456
and, therefore,
didn't apply in this case.

756
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:53,048
But that's exactly what Steve was doing.

757
00:41:53,073 --> 00:41:56,073
He was trying to save Sian
and recover Becky's body. So...

758
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,908
I'm very sorry.

759
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:00,640
The pond itself.

760
00:42:00,641 --> 00:42:03,639
And as you can see, we've pulled out
a lot of pieces of clothing.

761
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,639
- That's quite a lot there.
- It is.

762
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:07,640
What are we up to now?

763
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:11,479
About 20 items so far.
But I expect that to go up.

764
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:13,479
We're going to have another scan
of the pond

765
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:14,639
and see if we can pull anything else out.

766
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,087
We might have missed one or two things.

767
00:42:16,112 --> 00:42:17,146
Sir!

768
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:18,988
Yeah.

769
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:33,788
OK. Excellent.

770
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,520
I think that might be Sian's boot.

771
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:48,028
It was nice of you to come round.

772
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:51,999
I always felt that,
with everything that happened,

773
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,639
I never really got the chance
to tell you how sorry I was

774
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:55,640
about what happened to Ray.

775
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:59,532
Well, it's not been easy for me,

776
00:42:59,557 --> 00:43:03,482
knowing that he was so desperate
and that we couldn't help him.

777
00:43:03,483 --> 00:43:04,640
Thanks.

778
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:09,640
Look, I can't speak about
the allegations against him, but...

779
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:13,640
...from my point of view,
he was a good friend.

780
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:19,640
Yeah. There was a lot I wanted
to say about how he was treated.

781
00:43:22,953 --> 00:43:24,953
It's not worth it, Steve.

782
00:43:25,506 --> 00:43:28,506
I know what's been happening
with you, and it's not worth it.

783
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:33,640
The job meant everything to Ray,
too. But...

784
00:43:34,228 --> 00:43:36,640
...it wasn't more important
than his children...

785
00:43:37,028 --> 00:43:38,640
...than his life.

786
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:27,640
[PHONE RINGS]

787
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,308
Debs?

788
00:44:32,333 --> 00:44:34,333
Are you watching the local news?

789
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:39,908
I think the timing's
a bit too convenient.

790
00:44:40,353 --> 00:44:41,873
Where was it?

791
00:44:41,898 --> 00:44:44,538
They're carrying out a dig
at a spot in Ramsbury.

792
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,639
<i>I think this has come
from some information</i>

793
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,639
<i>passed on by Halliwell's
probation officer.</i>

794
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:51,639
<i>...the boot in the water
which we have recovered.</i>

795
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:54,128
<i>So, you were walking
along the lane and...?</i>

796
00:44:54,129 --> 00:44:57,639
<i>Scoping the ponds as to which I thought</i>

797
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:00,639
<i>would be most likely to deposit property.</i>

798
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,148
Why now?

799
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:04,999
<i>They've done nothing over the
last 18 months and then suddenly,</i>

800
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,639
<i>"Look what a great job we're doing."</i>

801
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,116
I reckon they're worried about backlash

802
00:45:08,117 --> 00:45:09,680
over the way you've been treated.

803
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,999
He says that numerous items
have been recovered.

804
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,639
<i>Mm. One of 60, I heard.</i>

805
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:15,679
60?

806
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:18,640
This could be what
you've been waiting for, Steve.

807
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:20,999
Yeah, I know.

808
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,639
Bollocks.

809
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:25,639
- What?
- I handed in my resignation.

810
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:26,988
I'm no longer a police officer.

811
00:45:27,305 --> 00:46:27,392
