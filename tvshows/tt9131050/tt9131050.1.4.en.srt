1
00:00:06,844 --> 00:00:08,571
Are you going to tell me 
where Sian is.

2
00:00:08,658 --> 00:00:09,953
Have you got a car?

3
00:00:10,046 --> 00:00:12,130
She's down the side
somewhere along here.

4
00:00:12,218 --> 00:00:14,414
I moved her body
a couple of nights ago.

5
00:00:15,069 --> 00:00:16,609
- Her body?
- Yeah.

6
00:00:16,697 --> 00:00:17,743
I was hoping
we were gonna save her.

7
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:19,029
Yeah, it's a shitty day.

8
00:00:19,117 --> 00:00:21,130
We need to chat,
me and you, now.

9
00:00:21,218 --> 00:00:22,685
What do you want
to talk about?

10
00:00:22,773 --> 00:00:24,140
Do you want another one?

11
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:25,820
Another one?

12
00:00:27,053 --> 00:00:28,206
She's down there.

13
00:00:28,294 --> 00:00:31,177
<i>I was today taken to the locations
of two bodies,</i>

14
00:00:31,265 --> 00:00:33,576
<i>but, thus far,
only one has been recovered.</i>

15
00:00:33,664 --> 00:00:34,958
That second girl is Becky.

16
00:00:37,622 --> 00:00:39,967
Keir and I just wanted to add
our congratulations

17
00:00:40,088 --> 00:00:41,818
- to everybody else's.
- Oh, thank you.

18
00:00:41,906 --> 00:00:44,546
I did hear the confessions
weren't PACE compliant.

19
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,833
No. In my opinion,
they were.

20
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:48,747
Well, I'm sure it'll all come out
in the wash.

21
00:00:48,842 --> 00:00:51,710
We've got a match
for the second girl, Rebecca Godden.

22
00:00:51,914 --> 00:00:53,398
We've got an address
for the mother.

23
00:00:53,645 --> 00:00:54,857
I know why you're here.

24
00:00:55,023 --> 00:00:56,253
Mrs Edwards,
can I come in?

25
00:00:56,341 --> 00:00:57,764
- What's going on?
- It's the police.

26
00:00:57,851 --> 00:01:00,250
They're here to tell me
that Becky's dead. Aren't you?

27
00:01:00,881 --> 00:01:03,402
Sorry. Yes, I am.
No! I can't...!

28
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:04,530
Karen!

29
00:01:04,695 --> 00:01:05,701
Steve!

30
00:01:05,789 --> 00:01:09,765
Karen...

31
00:01:09,912 --> 00:01:11,218
Karen...

32
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,074

33
00:01:59,376 --> 00:02:02,414
John Godden?
Father of Becky Godden?

34
00:02:04,202 --> 00:02:06,992
What am I gonna do
without my little Becky?

35
00:02:14,406 --> 00:02:16,656
Mr Godden,
could I please ask...?

36
00:02:18,477 --> 00:02:22,173
Mr Godden,
does that name mean anything to you?

37
00:02:22,261 --> 00:02:23,707
- Christopher Halliwell?
- No...

38
00:02:23,832 --> 00:02:25,652
No, I never heard of him.

39
00:02:26,469 --> 00:02:27,965
Oh...!

40
00:02:28,053 --> 00:02:29,082
Mr Godden...

41
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:31,621
...when did you last see Becky?

42
00:02:31,722 --> 00:02:33,082
It was...

43
00:02:33,507 --> 00:02:37,340
..it was me and Karen splitting up,
that's why she went off the rails.

44
00:02:39,723 --> 00:02:41,168
Mr Godden...

45
00:02:41,855 --> 00:02:44,933
- Yeah?
- So, when did you last see Becky?

46
00:02:46,069 --> 00:02:47,675
Oh, er...

47
00:02:49,261 --> 00:02:50,668
Hm...

48
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,238
A while back.
I don't remember when.

49
00:02:54,832 --> 00:02:57,269
I knew something like this
was gonna happen now.

50
00:02:57,455 --> 00:02:59,519
Everything's going against us.

51
00:03:00,502 --> 00:03:03,793
My other daughter,
she needs special care.

52
00:03:03,881 --> 00:03:06,527
Which I'm trying to organise.
But this is...

53
00:03:08,149 --> 00:03:10,011
It's just one blow
after another.

54
00:03:14,645 --> 00:03:16,645

Episode Title: <font color=#FFFF00>"Episode # 1.4"</font>

55
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:18,879
Becky was killed in 2003.

56
00:03:19,003 --> 00:03:20,728
Sian in 2011.

57
00:03:20,863 --> 00:03:23,494
Eight years.
Now, that is too long a gap

58
00:03:23,582 --> 00:03:26,345
for him not to have been
involved in any others in between.

59
00:03:26,433 --> 00:03:28,090
- Steve...
- I mean, why say

60
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:32,691
that you think the murder
was in 2003, 2004 or 2005,

61
00:03:32,832 --> 00:03:34,173
unless there are other murders

62
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,166
and you've got them mixed up
in your head?

63
00:03:36,253 --> 00:03:38,144
I need you
to stand down.

64
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,410
Take a break
and recharge the batteries.

65
00:03:44,152 --> 00:03:45,543
As soon as we can get it
arranged,

66
00:03:45,631 --> 00:03:49,087
we're planning to put in
a small team from MCIT Bristol

67
00:03:49,175 --> 00:03:51,675
to wrap things up,
so we can all move on...

68
00:03:51,763 --> 00:03:53,260
- ..after a brilliant result.
- You're not listening to me.

69
00:03:53,347 --> 00:03:55,090
There will be more victims,
Pat.

70
00:03:59,941 --> 00:04:02,621
He said they're cutting everything
back and they want to replace me.

71
00:04:02,785 --> 00:04:04,105
No, not straight away,

72
00:04:04,192 --> 00:04:05,793
but they're making me
hand the case over.

73
00:04:06,066 --> 00:04:08,300
Well,
what else am I supposed to do?

74
00:04:08,402 --> 00:04:09,504
It's like they're not even
prepared

75
00:04:09,591 --> 00:04:11,541
to acknowledge the fact
of the notion

76
00:04:11,629 --> 00:04:13,471
that we might have
a serial killer on our hands.

77
00:04:13,558 --> 00:04:15,855
Listen, anyway, I'd better go.
I'm at the checkout.

78
00:04:16,175 --> 00:04:17,418
OK, love you.
Bye-bye.

79
00:04:18,575 --> 00:04:19,933
Number two, please.

80
00:04:22,347 --> 00:04:24,793
- Â£42.70, please.
- Thank you.

81
00:04:26,145 --> 00:04:27,441
Sorry, excuse me.

82
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:29,707
Aren't you the policeman

83
00:04:29,795 --> 00:04:31,629
who was on the
Sian O'Callaghan case?

84
00:04:31,863 --> 00:04:33,707
- Er...
- It is you, isn't it?

85
00:04:34,222 --> 00:04:36,488
Well, it was a team effort, but, er...

86
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:39,160
- Can I just shake your hand, please?
- Thanks.

87
00:04:39,355 --> 00:04:40,495
Bloody brilliant what you did.

88
00:04:40,582 --> 00:04:42,112
I couldn't believe
you caught him so quick.

89
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:43,246
- Thank you.
- This is, er...

90
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:46,316
This is the guy
who found Sian O'Callaghan's killer.

91
00:04:47,659 --> 00:04:49,572
Well done.

92
00:04:51,344 --> 00:04:53,355
- Nice one. Good job.
- Thank you.

93
00:04:54,192 --> 00:04:56,058
- Nice one, mate.
- Thank you.

94
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:14,134
OK, his bag's packed.

95
00:05:14,222 --> 00:05:16,511
- He's just choosing a DVD.
- OK.

96
00:05:16,972 --> 00:05:19,051
Before you go,
I, erm...

97
00:05:19,723 --> 00:05:21,168
I've got something for you.

98
00:05:27,621 --> 00:05:29,207
It's a lock of Sian's hair.

99
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:32,019
The funeral parlour did it
for us.

100
00:05:32,513 --> 00:05:34,707
I've got one and
I've given one to Mum.

101
00:05:36,726 --> 00:05:37,886
Thanks.

102
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:40,611
I'll call tomorrow
about the funeral,

103
00:05:40,699 --> 00:05:42,169
just to go through
the arrangements with you.

104
00:05:42,256 --> 00:05:43,511
Right.

105
00:05:44,248 --> 00:05:45,699
Go on,
what did you choose?

106
00:05:45,787 --> 00:05:46,924
Cloudy With
A Chance Of Meatballs.

107
00:05:47,011 --> 00:05:49,293
Oh, not that again!

108
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:51,246
Come on, then.

109
00:05:56,785 --> 00:05:58,111
- Bye, Aiden.
- Bye.

110
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:00,144
- Bye.
- Bye, sweetheart. Bye.

111
00:06:05,723 --> 00:06:08,386
Why are you going to speak to Mick
about the funeral details?

112
00:06:08,723 --> 00:06:10,173
Because he's Sian's father.

113
00:06:10,261 --> 00:06:12,837
Yeah, he doesn't need
to be worrying about all that.

114
00:06:12,941 --> 00:06:14,590
He's got enough
on his plate.

115
00:06:15,058 --> 00:06:17,340
Anyway,
it's all done.

116
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:19,859
What is?

117
00:06:20,896 --> 00:06:22,085
The funeral.

118
00:06:22,347 --> 00:06:24,441
I've booked for us
to go and see Hilliers.

119
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,836
- What?
- Yeah, I just said to myself,

120
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:29,307
"We need to apply
the KISS principle."

121
00:06:29,542 --> 00:06:30,800
Keep it simple, stupid.

122
00:06:30,888 --> 00:06:32,175
Now...

123
00:06:32,562 --> 00:06:34,251
..have you been to see the doctor
about...?

124
00:06:35,078 --> 00:06:37,093
- No. I haven't been able to face it.
- Right,

125
00:06:37,181 --> 00:06:38,869
I am booking you
an appointment

126
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:41,072
and I am taking you there
myself.

127
00:06:41,244 --> 00:06:43,158
No ifs or buts.

128
00:06:50,337 --> 00:06:51,820
Hello, Declan!

129
00:06:51,908 --> 00:06:53,236
It's me. It's Chris.

130
00:06:53,411 --> 00:06:55,142
Chris.
How are you, mate?

131
00:06:55,955 --> 00:06:58,954
Yeah, not so bad.
Stuck in here, of course.

132
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:01,181
I'm on remand at the moment.

133
00:07:01,355 --> 00:07:03,354
Well, it's a lot of waiting around,
really.

134
00:07:03,986 --> 00:07:06,486
But it's changed a lot
since I was last in here.

135
00:07:06,837 --> 00:07:08,869
Well, it was much more
stricter then.

136
00:07:09,476 --> 00:07:11,728
Well, it's a load of bollocks, mate.

137
00:07:11,829 --> 00:07:13,751
But they want to interview me.

138
00:07:14,369 --> 00:07:16,822
Yeah, they want to interview me
about eight murders.

139
00:07:19,724 --> 00:07:22,361
I don't know, mate.
I don't know.

140
00:07:22,587 --> 00:07:25,636
<i>For over a week
her identity was a mystery.</i>

141
00:07:25,829 --> 00:07:29,636
<i>But detectives have finally been
able to name the unknown woman,</i>

142
00:07:29,723 --> 00:07:32,853
<i>her body found buried
at a Cotswold beauty spot...</i>

143
00:07:41,614 --> 00:07:42,679
Where is everyone?

144
00:07:42,869 --> 00:07:45,345
- Re-assigned overnight.
- Already?

145
00:07:47,722 --> 00:07:50,228
I've only been given
to the end of the week myself.

146
00:07:55,077 --> 00:07:57,357
Right, get everyone who we have left
in the briefing room.

147
00:07:58,785 --> 00:08:00,978
Jesus Christ...!

148
00:08:01,723 --> 00:08:04,406
OK, so the news back from the lab
is mixed.

149
00:08:04,494 --> 00:08:06,695
The good news is
there's a match for Sian's DNA

150
00:08:06,783 --> 00:08:08,235
on the spots of blood
on the car seat covers

151
00:08:08,322 --> 00:08:09,726
Halliwell was trying
to dispose of.

152
00:08:09,814 --> 00:08:13,007
Yeah, but surely he could just say
that he was a cab driver

153
00:08:13,095 --> 00:08:16,288
and Sian got in as a passenger
and had a nosebleed or something.

154
00:08:16,376 --> 00:08:19,773
Yeah. Although there is a match
for Halliwell's DNA on Sian's body

155
00:08:19,861 --> 00:08:20,899
from the bite mark to her breast.

156
00:08:20,986 --> 00:08:22,403
But it's only partial.

157
00:08:22,847 --> 00:08:24,472
No match from the perfume bottle.

158
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,619
Erm, there is actually
a full female DNA profile on it,

159
00:08:27,723 --> 00:08:28,637
but it's not Sian's or Becky's.

160
00:08:28,724 --> 00:08:30,986
Which begs the question,
whose is it?

161
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:34,945
Also they've been unable
to positively identify the item

162
00:08:35,033 --> 00:08:36,399
he left burning
in the middle of the road.

163
00:08:36,486 --> 00:08:37,632
What are they saying about

164
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,601
the gaffer tape gag
found with Becky's body?

165
00:08:39,689 --> 00:08:41,271
Very unlikely to provide
any profile

166
00:08:41,359 --> 00:08:43,115
given how long
it's been in the ground.

167
00:08:44,187 --> 00:08:46,022
Right, I think we're going
to find other victims.

168
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:48,505
There's a big gap
between Becky and Sian's murders.

169
00:08:48,593 --> 00:08:50,872
So cross-reference
Halliwell's known whereabouts

170
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:54,577
between those dates
against cold cases and mispers.

171
00:08:55,885 --> 00:08:58,050
None of us knows
how much longer we have got left

172
00:08:58,138 --> 00:09:00,037
on this investigation,
myself included.

173
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:02,494
There are currently
1,500 actions

174
00:09:02,582 --> 00:09:04,439
pending on the Holmes System.

175
00:09:04,527 --> 00:09:06,560
We actually need
double

176
00:09:06,648 --> 00:09:08,402
the team that
we had a few days ago,

177
00:09:08,489 --> 00:09:10,233
and we have
less than half now.

178
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,642
I'm not quite sure
how that logic prevails,

179
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:15,322
but, erm,
let's do what we can, eh?

180
00:09:15,644 --> 00:09:17,316
Right, see you soon.

181
00:09:41,435 --> 00:09:42,703
What have we done?

182
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,669
Oh, sit down,
for God's sake.

183
00:09:56,435 --> 00:09:57,888
Oh...

184
00:10:00,255 --> 00:10:03,162
- Do you want anything?
- I'll have a cup of tea.

185
00:10:03,943 --> 00:10:05,544
And a bacon sarnie.

186
00:10:14,509 --> 00:10:16,509
What are we gonna do
without her?

187
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:20,493
She was
our little girl.

188
00:10:20,669 --> 00:10:22,724
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

189
00:10:23,982 --> 00:10:26,427
I asked to see you, John,
because I want to know something.

190
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:27,800
Oh...

191
00:10:27,888 --> 00:10:30,199
I want to know
how you and your family

192
00:10:30,287 --> 00:10:31,240
were telling me
you'd seen Becky

193
00:10:31,328 --> 00:10:33,630
when, all along,
she was dead in the ground.

194
00:10:35,005 --> 00:10:36,537
No, it's not right.

195
00:10:36,849 --> 00:10:39,484
2003 she was murdered, John.

196
00:10:39,677 --> 00:10:42,152
But I've been told that your dad,
your nephew,

197
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,167
all different members of your family
have said they've seen her

198
00:10:45,255 --> 00:10:48,240
- as recent as a couple of years ago.
- I don't know.

199
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,667
- Maybe they got the dates wrong.
- Nonsense.

200
00:10:51,755 --> 00:10:52,826
Your dad...

201
00:10:52,914 --> 00:10:54,734
Your dad would
remember when he saw

202
00:10:54,822 --> 00:10:56,943
his own granddaughter,
wouldn't he?

203
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:59,493
Well, his memory's not
as good as it was.

204
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,425
It's not good enough, John.

205
00:11:01,513 --> 00:11:04,621
Because while you lot
were telling me you'd seen her,

206
00:11:04,709 --> 00:11:07,144
she never got properly reported
as missing.

207
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:12,146
Well, you can't blame me
for your own guilty conscience.

208
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,671
I knew...

209
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:17,339
I knew she would have come to see me
if she was still alive.

210
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:18,649
I knew it.

211
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:20,889
Why, John?

212
00:11:20,977 --> 00:11:22,263
Oh...

213
00:11:23,413 --> 00:11:24,638
Was it...?

214
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,224
Was it just to try
and hurt me?

215
00:11:29,486 --> 00:11:30,972
Hm? Was that it?

216
00:11:31,068 --> 00:11:33,076
You're talking trash,
as usual.

217
00:11:34,904 --> 00:11:37,435
God forgive you lot
for what you've done.

218
00:11:46,454 --> 00:11:48,886
The reason I got in touch is, er...

219
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:51,216
..cos I shared
a cell with Halliwell

220
00:11:51,489 --> 00:11:54,318
round about '87, '88 maybe.

221
00:11:54,563 --> 00:11:56,974
He was just in for nicking stuff,
as I remember.

222
00:11:57,363 --> 00:11:59,083
And what was it
that disturbed you?

223
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,732
Two things I brought to mind.

224
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:03,860
Er...

225
00:12:04,294 --> 00:12:05,974
Once, he asks me,

226
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:10,474
"Have you ever had sex with a woman
while you're strangling her?"

227
00:12:11,056 --> 00:12:14,253
I remember that. Another time,
we're lying there on the bunks,

228
00:12:14,341 --> 00:12:16,053
and this time he asks me,

229
00:12:16,579 --> 00:12:20,232
"How many do you have to kill
to be a serial killer?"

230
00:12:20,455 --> 00:12:21,621
Mm.

231
00:12:21,709 --> 00:12:24,677
Tends to stick in your mind,
them sort of things.

232
00:12:25,654 --> 00:12:28,667
Oh, his big hero,
I can tell you,

233
00:12:28,755 --> 00:12:33,427
was that Myra Hindley
off the Moors Murders.

234
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:36,253
<i>They want to interview me.</i>

235
00:12:36,341 --> 00:12:38,560
<i>Yeah, they want to interview me
about eight murders.</i>

236
00:12:39,123 --> 00:12:41,579
From a phone call two days ago.

237
00:12:42,089 --> 00:12:43,609
Eight.

238
00:12:43,731 --> 00:12:46,068
Who's mentioned eight?
Certainly not us.

239
00:12:46,216 --> 00:12:49,037
- Who's he talking to?
- A mate of his he phoned from prison.

240
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:50,789
He's known him since school.

241
00:12:51,254 --> 00:12:52,821
2003, Becky.

242
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,287
2011, Sian.

243
00:12:55,477 --> 00:12:58,240
- Eight years.
- Eight years, eight murders.

244
00:12:58,732 --> 00:13:01,199
This is surely grounds
for further investigation.

245
00:13:01,287 --> 00:13:03,150
We have to step up
resources again.

246
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:05,807
Steve, I've decided
I'm moving on.

247
00:13:06,057 --> 00:13:08,994
I'm going to take up a post
with the UK Border Force.

248
00:13:09,853 --> 00:13:12,047
Regardless,
this recording may not be enough

249
00:13:12,135 --> 00:13:13,187
to keep this investigation open.

250
00:13:13,274 --> 00:13:14,533
Sir...

251
00:13:14,736 --> 00:13:18,055
...we are starting to get hits
and matches

252
00:13:18,143 --> 00:13:20,398
with unsolved murders
and missing persons.

253
00:13:20,486 --> 00:13:23,322
Locally, there's a sex worker
went missing in the early '90s,

254
00:13:23,424 --> 00:13:25,805
body never found,
last seen just around the corner

255
00:13:25,893 --> 00:13:28,164
from where
Halliwell lived at the time.

256
00:13:28,251 --> 00:13:29,718
And there will be others,

257
00:13:29,806 --> 00:13:31,258
absolutely no doubt.

258
00:13:31,346 --> 00:13:33,611
Halliwell's hero
is Myra Hindley.

259
00:13:33,853 --> 00:13:36,236
We need more resources,
not less.

260
00:13:36,378 --> 00:13:39,033
Sir, we have got to investigate this
properly,

261
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:41,875
find out if there are any matches
around the country.

262
00:13:41,963 --> 00:13:44,008
Steve, it's not going to be my call,
OK?

263
00:13:44,096 --> 00:13:45,831
It's gonna be Pat Geenty taking over
as Chief,

264
00:13:45,918 --> 00:13:47,916
and, no doubt,
Mike Veale becoming his deputy.

265
00:13:48,039 --> 00:13:49,322
It's gonna be for them
to decide

266
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:52,674
if they want to put any more
resources into this, not me.

267
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:12,093
Evening.

268
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:13,313
Nice to see you.

269
00:14:13,401 --> 00:14:15,257
Uh. Usual deal,
none of what we talk about

270
00:14:15,345 --> 00:14:17,390
can be used by ITV
until after the verdict.

271
00:14:17,478 --> 00:14:18,845
Yeah, agreed.

272
00:14:19,413 --> 00:14:20,749
Well, he's a serial killer.

273
00:14:20,837 --> 00:14:22,897
Rob, I am convinced of it.

274
00:14:22,985 --> 00:14:25,493
On top of the two that
we know he's killed,

275
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:26,945
I think there's probably
another six.

276
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:28,196
Six?!

277
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:31,305
Mm-hm. But I need a bigger team
to properly investigate him.

278
00:14:47,413 --> 00:14:49,047
I love that jacket.

279
00:14:49,437 --> 00:14:51,087
That was her favourite.
I couldn't wear it.

280
00:14:51,174 --> 00:14:52,891
Just have it
as a keepsake.

281
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:01,383
Can you finish this one?

282
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,344
When do you think
you're going to move back in, Kev?

283
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:14,391
I will at some point.
But... just not now.

284
00:15:29,611 --> 00:15:31,805
Why don't you sort something out
for her to wear?

285
00:15:34,415 --> 00:15:36,758
For the funeral.
Don't tell me what you choose.

286
00:15:36,946 --> 00:15:38,782
It'll just be
between the two of you.

287
00:16:00,782 --> 00:16:02,360
- Not too tight.
- OK.

288
00:16:10,532 --> 00:16:12,391
You look so smart.

289
00:16:18,981 --> 00:16:20,980
Come on, Pete,
Sharon's her auntie.

290
00:16:21,258 --> 00:16:23,319
- It's only a poem, please.
- I'm sorry, Sharon,

291
00:16:23,407 --> 00:16:25,367
but we've only got
a certain amount of allotted time

292
00:16:25,454 --> 00:16:26,764
and the service
has all been

293
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:28,523
- very carefully worked out.
- But surely...?

294
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:30,056
Elaine asked me to do it
and I've done it.

295
00:16:30,143 --> 00:16:32,758
- Is the timing really that precise?
- Mum, she's here!

296
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,812
God bless her.

297
00:17:19,892 --> 00:17:20,979
<i>Close friends told me</i>

298
00:17:21,066 --> 00:17:23,905
<i>she was outgoing,
loyal, fun, caring.</i>

299
00:17:23,993 --> 00:17:26,249
<i>A great auntie
to her friends' children.</i>

300
00:17:26,337 --> 00:17:30,673
<i>A young women with so much promise,
so much zest for life.</i>

301
00:17:31,019 --> 00:17:33,220
<i>That life was honoured today.</i>

302
00:17:33,876 --> 00:17:37,204
<i>Today proved
how much she meant to this town.</i>

303
00:17:41,933 --> 00:17:43,329
Are they for Sian?

304
00:17:43,733 --> 00:17:44,978
Yeah.

305
00:17:55,668 --> 00:17:56,890
Mint sauce?

306
00:17:56,978 --> 00:17:58,626
- It's minted lamb!
- I like mint sauce.

307
00:17:58,713 --> 00:18:00,775
Well,
how bloody minty do you want it?

308
00:18:00,933 --> 00:18:02,173
Minty.

309
00:18:14,154 --> 00:18:16,626
If we're doing this mother-daughter
thing, how's work?

310
00:18:16,713 --> 00:18:18,866
- OK.
- Just OK?

311
00:18:18,962 --> 00:18:21,092
I'm not gonna
make a career out of it.

312
00:18:23,713 --> 00:18:26,393
I want to have babies,
don't I?

313
00:18:37,285 --> 00:18:39,222
It'll be some time
before we can...

314
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:41,309
..release Becky's body
for burial.

315
00:18:41,713 --> 00:18:44,626
And we are aware that
this is a distressing time for you.

316
00:18:45,045 --> 00:18:47,752
- We want her back.
- Of course.

317
00:18:48,295 --> 00:18:50,625
Now, obviously, Becky's body

318
00:18:50,721 --> 00:18:53,022
was photographed
as we found her.

319
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:56,326
And as this is an image
which will be shown in court...

320
00:18:56,905 --> 00:18:59,269
..we wanted to give you
the opportunity to view it first,

321
00:18:59,357 --> 00:19:01,186
should you feel you wanted to.

322
00:19:03,357 --> 00:19:04,467
Yeah?

323
00:19:05,053 --> 00:19:06,936
- Yeah.
- OK.

324
00:19:08,603 --> 00:19:09,908
So...

325
00:19:10,073 --> 00:19:13,748
..the main photo is her
as we found her.

326
00:19:31,193 --> 00:19:33,326
- Karen!
- No, I'm all right, I'm all right.

327
00:19:33,414 --> 00:19:35,545
I'm all right.
Just leave me down here a minute.

328
00:19:36,479 --> 00:19:38,076
I'll get some water.

329
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:44,545
He cut...

330
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:46,483
He cut...

331
00:19:47,233 --> 00:19:48,983
He cut her head off...

332
00:19:49,472 --> 00:19:51,472
...and her hands and her feet.

333
00:19:54,186 --> 00:19:55,764
The pathologist can't be sure

334
00:19:55,874 --> 00:19:59,381
whether Halliwell did that
or if animals did.

335
00:20:00,239 --> 00:20:01,545
He did it.

336
00:20:04,546 --> 00:20:07,244
Come on, love,
drink this.

337
00:20:09,686 --> 00:20:14,490
Why would he do that
to a little girl?

338
00:20:26,177 --> 00:20:27,787
125 quid fine.

339
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:29,137
That's not actually too bad.

340
00:20:29,225 --> 00:20:30,902
And a drugs
rehabilitation course.

341
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:31,949
You can't take that lightly,

342
00:20:32,037 --> 00:20:33,888
or they'll put you back in prison,
my young lady.

343
00:20:33,975 --> 00:20:35,777
I ain't done any drugs
for three whole weeks.

344
00:20:35,865 --> 00:20:36,699
You'll be so proud of me.

345
00:20:36,787 --> 00:20:38,629
- Also, look at that.
- What's that?

346
00:20:38,724 --> 00:20:41,044
One of those prison officers
put a cigarette out on my arm.

347
00:20:41,209 --> 00:20:42,481
Such a bitch!

348
00:20:42,569 --> 00:20:44,309
Oh, can we keep
the hood down?

349
00:20:44,397 --> 00:20:45,817
I love it with the hood down.

350
00:20:45,905 --> 00:20:48,139
And I don't smell bad,
I just like it.

351
00:20:48,927 --> 00:20:51,437
We'll get you home,
give you a nice bubble bath

352
00:20:51,553 --> 00:20:53,169
and then we'll go out
for a posh dinner.

353
00:20:53,273 --> 00:20:54,834
- How about that?
- Yeah.

354
00:20:57,541 --> 00:20:59,861
- Mum...
- Yeah?

355
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,959
Can I go see
my boyfriend first?

356
00:21:06,713 --> 00:21:08,284
- No.
- Please, Mum.

357
00:21:08,371 --> 00:21:10,084
I'm so excited to see him.
I'll just...

358
00:21:10,171 --> 00:21:12,713
I'll pop in, I'll say hello.
That'll be it.

359
00:21:28,253 --> 00:21:29,870
I'm not coming home, Mum.

360
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:32,868
Becky, get in the car.

361
00:21:33,978 --> 00:21:35,993
I got... I got myself clean.

362
00:21:36,081 --> 00:21:38,417
I can't keep putting you
through this.

363
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:44,667
I'm sorry.

364
00:22:57,925 --> 00:23:00,405
- How are you coping?
- OK.

365
00:23:01,272 --> 00:23:03,225
You don't feel the need
for any anti-depressants?

366
00:23:03,761 --> 00:23:06,420
I don't see the point.
I know why I am depressed.

367
00:23:07,413 --> 00:23:09,120
It was two girls, wasn't it?

368
00:23:09,413 --> 00:23:10,892
Sian and another girl.

369
00:23:10,979 --> 00:23:12,413
Just lift your arm.

370
00:23:14,436 --> 00:23:15,940
All of us here, we're...

371
00:23:16,745 --> 00:23:18,224
..we're very sorry.

372
00:23:18,925 --> 00:23:22,482
That pisses me off.
Sian's name always being mentioned

373
00:23:22,569 --> 00:23:24,413
in the same breath
as the other girl.

374
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:26,753
I'm so sorry,
have I got that wrong?

375
00:23:28,724 --> 00:23:30,292
Erm, get dressed again.

376
00:23:31,728 --> 00:23:33,243
No, there was another victim.

377
00:23:33,331 --> 00:23:36,768
But the circumstances
were completely different.

378
00:23:37,658 --> 00:23:40,698
She was a drug addict
and a prostitute...

379
00:23:41,597 --> 00:23:43,961
..and must have
accepted there was...

380
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:46,532
..a risk attached
to her profession.

381
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:47,800
Sian was an ordinary girl

382
00:23:47,887 --> 00:23:49,704
who had a boyfriend
and a job in an office.

383
00:23:49,792 --> 00:23:52,252
She was just on a night out
with her friends.

384
00:23:52,717 --> 00:23:54,326
Obviously,
I feel sorry for Becky,

385
00:23:54,413 --> 00:23:57,011
but I'd hate for people to think
Sian was the same as her.

386
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:02,112
Well, Elaine,
there is something there.

387
00:24:02,757 --> 00:24:06,326
So now we need to take a scan
and a biopsy

388
00:24:06,413 --> 00:24:08,917
to try and work out exactly
what it is.

389
00:24:09,706 --> 00:24:12,698
So, look, don't worry about it
too much just yet.

390
00:24:16,813 --> 00:24:18,153
Are we seeing him today?

391
00:24:18,241 --> 00:24:19,665
No, just the lawyers.

392
00:24:19,753 --> 00:24:21,717
All the... legal arguments.

393
00:24:22,955 --> 00:24:24,534
One of the solicitors
said that I

394
00:24:24,622 --> 00:24:27,964
Halliwel might try and claim
that Sian is a prostitute.

395
00:24:28,878 --> 00:24:30,057
If they start saying that,

396
00:24:30,145 --> 00:24:31,504
I'm telling you now,
I'm gonna lose it.

397
00:24:31,591 --> 00:24:33,235
- They can't say that!
- They won't.

398
00:24:33,479 --> 00:24:36,675
We can clearly demonstrate
she was nothing like Becky.

399
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:39,299
We've got to wait in here,
yeah?

400
00:24:45,413 --> 00:24:47,079
I'm Mick, Sian's dad.

401
00:24:47,167 --> 00:24:48,171
Pleased to meet you.

402
00:24:48,259 --> 00:24:49,964
This is, er,
Debbie my wife.

403
00:24:52,049 --> 00:24:53,376
I can't believe Elaine and I

404
00:24:53,464 --> 00:24:54,652
have gone through
what we've gone through,

405
00:24:54,739 --> 00:24:57,340
and, all along, we've only lived
a few doors away from each other.

406
00:25:00,954 --> 00:25:03,831
But Becky and Sian are together
forever now, aren't they?

407
00:25:08,354 --> 00:25:10,011
All rise.

408
00:25:36,057 --> 00:25:38,175
Mr Geenty,
I am not allowed to give evidence,

409
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:42,032
but I can tell you that,
apart from in terrorism cases,

410
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,464
I have never come across

411
00:25:43,557 --> 00:25:46,626
the urgent interview provision
to PACE being used.

412
00:25:46,714 --> 00:25:50,261
It's a very unusual beast.
Would you agree with that?

413
00:25:51,413 --> 00:25:52,714
Yes, it is.

414
00:25:54,979 --> 00:25:57,792
But what it does not mean is that,
for example...

415
00:25:58,658 --> 00:26:00,831
..you can abandon
the need to caution.

416
00:26:01,026 --> 00:26:03,409
The PACE guidelines
quite clearly indicate

417
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:06,209
that a person is entitled
to have his rights explained to him

418
00:26:06,518 --> 00:26:08,326
and a police officer's duty

419
00:26:08,414 --> 00:26:11,362
is to ensure
that they understand those rights.

420
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:12,869
It is.

421
00:26:13,026 --> 00:26:14,649
And that's an inviolate position.

422
00:26:14,737 --> 00:26:16,079
Yes, it is.

423
00:26:16,167 --> 00:26:19,656
But I have to say that I think
the decision that Steve made was,

424
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:23,253
to use the slang,
a gutsy decision.

425
00:26:23,891 --> 00:26:27,557
I'd like to think I'd make a similar
decision in the same circumstances.

426
00:26:30,511 --> 00:26:32,151
I've just been told the defence QC

427
00:26:32,239 --> 00:26:34,325
is going to move
to have you excluded from the trial.

428
00:26:34,413 --> 00:26:35,540
What?

429
00:26:35,628 --> 00:26:37,326
I'm sure
they're just trying it on.

430
00:26:37,413 --> 00:26:39,815
An attempt to rattle you
before you testify today.

431
00:26:40,065 --> 00:26:42,662
But what it does mean is
they don't really have any defence,

432
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:44,109
except attacking you.

433
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:46,626
So that's why they haven't put out
a defence statement.

434
00:26:46,714 --> 00:26:47,765
Exactly.

435
00:26:47,852 --> 00:26:49,511
- Right.
- Thanks, Ian.

436
00:26:51,413 --> 00:26:53,895
I swear to tell the truth, the whole
truth and nothing but the truth,

437
00:26:53,982 --> 00:26:55,327
so help me God.

438
00:26:55,776 --> 00:26:57,326
Detective Superintendent Fulcher,

439
00:26:57,413 --> 00:26:59,229
you knew
that Sian O'Callaghan was dead

440
00:26:59,317 --> 00:27:01,681
long before you met Mr Halliwell
in that car park, didn't you?

441
00:27:01,768 --> 00:27:04,479
I had no way of knowing
if she was dead or alive.

442
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:07,854
Looking through your own notes
at the time,

443
00:27:07,942 --> 00:27:10,261
you talk about "the prospect
of recovering her body".

444
00:27:11,091 --> 00:27:12,611
You believed she was dead, didn't you?

445
00:27:13,823 --> 00:27:16,326
Er, I think you're missing
the point here.

446
00:27:16,413 --> 00:27:20,326
What I thought, er, hoped
or even believed

447
00:27:20,413 --> 00:27:24,326
is irrelevant to the execution
of my duties as a police officer

448
00:27:24,413 --> 00:27:27,143
and my responsibilities
to Sian O'Callaghan.

449
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:31,105
Barbury Castle's a remote area, isn't it?

450
00:27:31,761 --> 00:27:33,097
Yes, I suppose it is.

451
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:36,325
About as different from the custody
suite of Gable Cross Police Station

452
00:27:36,413 --> 00:27:38,238
as it is possible to envisage, isn't it?

453
00:27:38,325 --> 00:27:39,437
Yes.

454
00:27:40,637 --> 00:27:43,016
What I suggest to you
is that you took Mr Halliwell there

455
00:27:43,104 --> 00:27:44,539
because you thought that would be

456
00:27:44,626 --> 00:27:47,326
an additional element of pressure
upon him.

457
00:27:47,737 --> 00:27:49,643
That's what you were doing, isn't it?

458
00:27:50,065 --> 00:27:54,673
I believed Barbury Castle was
most likely to be where Sian was,

459
00:27:54,761 --> 00:27:57,456
and that, if I took Christopher
there for an urgent interview,

460
00:27:57,636 --> 00:27:59,712
it would necessarily mean
getting to her quicker,

461
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,412
if he was prepared to tell us
where she was.

462
00:28:02,964 --> 00:28:05,055
And if that involved
abandoning his PACE rights,

463
00:28:05,143 --> 00:28:06,604
you were prepared to do that?

464
00:28:06,839 --> 00:28:08,563
I believed
the urgent interview provision

465
00:28:08,651 --> 00:28:11,151
enabled me to take
the course of action that I did.

466
00:28:11,413 --> 00:28:13,901
Mr Fulcher, your own deputy,
Detective Inspector Kirby,

467
00:28:13,989 --> 00:28:15,626
told you it was not a good idea

468
00:28:15,714 --> 00:28:17,782
for you to conduct
an additional urgent interview

469
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:19,837
yourself with Halliwell, didn't he?

470
00:28:21,346 --> 00:28:22,986
Yes, he did.

471
00:28:23,233 --> 00:28:25,506
He said you'd be sailing
very close to the wind,

472
00:28:25,909 --> 00:28:28,773
in terms of a breach of PACE,
didn't he?

473
00:28:30,251 --> 00:28:31,635
Words to that effect.

474
00:28:35,878 --> 00:28:37,703
I can't believe
he didn't caution Halliwell.

475
00:28:37,791 --> 00:28:40,118
Why didn't he just do it
when he was talking to him?

476
00:28:40,206 --> 00:28:41,618
It's not just the caution, Mum.

477
00:28:41,706 --> 00:28:44,231
They've got to take him to a police
station and give him a solicitor.

478
00:28:44,318 --> 00:28:45,944
I feel so sorry for Steve.

479
00:28:46,032 --> 00:28:48,628
That bloody lawyer
is really going for him.

480
00:28:48,908 --> 00:28:50,521
I think he's made a mistake.

481
00:28:50,956 --> 00:28:53,657
But if he hadn't done what he did,
we'd never have found Becky.

482
00:28:53,745 --> 00:28:55,839
A big fucking mistake.

483
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,165
Let's move on now to the

484
00:29:02,253 --> 00:29:04,046
"Do you want another one?"
conversation.

485
00:29:04,479 --> 00:29:06,633
As soon as he began talking to you,

486
00:29:06,721 --> 00:29:10,703
you appreciated it had nothing to do
with the Sian investigation.

487
00:29:10,808 --> 00:29:11,831
Yes.

488
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:14,760
Well, surely, as the conversation
progressed, you should have said,

489
00:29:15,157 --> 00:29:17,400
"Look, we'll talk about this
at the police station later."

490
00:29:17,487 --> 00:29:19,218
That's what you should have said,
shouldn't you?

491
00:29:19,305 --> 00:29:22,326
My view was that we were in the moment.

492
00:29:22,413 --> 00:29:25,024
If he was offering the information,
I would rather have it

493
00:29:25,112 --> 00:29:27,602
and not curtail it,
than not find Becky Godden.

494
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:30,391
And once Mr Halliwell was taken back
to Gable Cross Police Station

495
00:29:30,479 --> 00:29:33,016
and given a solicitor,
to your intense annoyance,

496
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:34,330
he decided he didn't want to answer

497
00:29:34,417 --> 00:29:35,938
any further questions in an interview.

498
00:29:36,049 --> 00:29:37,545
It was frustrating, yes.

499
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:41,665
And you and your team went out of
your way to undermine Mr Coleman,

500
00:29:41,753 --> 00:29:44,453
who attended throughout
the interview process, didn't you?

501
00:29:48,948 --> 00:29:51,877
I thought
it was utterly ridiculous...

502
00:29:52,534 --> 00:29:56,617
..that an individual, who had taken
me and numerous other people

503
00:29:56,704 --> 00:29:59,456
from a surveillance convoy
to two dead bodies,

504
00:29:59,861 --> 00:30:02,684
should seek to find some mechanism,
some...

505
00:30:03,627 --> 00:30:05,482
..quirk of the law, some loophole,

506
00:30:05,917 --> 00:30:09,323
to get him away from the fact
that he was a multiple murderer.

507
00:30:10,604 --> 00:30:12,877
So PACE, in your view, is a loophole?

508
00:30:18,823 --> 00:30:20,326
It was a travesty!

509
00:30:20,503 --> 00:30:21,909
It was like I was on trial.

510
00:30:22,198 --> 00:30:23,326
What about the judge?

511
00:30:23,413 --> 00:30:25,326
Hm, it's hard to tell.

512
00:30:25,432 --> 00:30:28,174
She did seem more impressed with
their QC than ours,

513
00:30:28,276 --> 00:30:29,432
I could see that.

514
00:30:29,721 --> 00:30:33,542
And this is the first criminal case
she's ever presided over.

515
00:30:33,901 --> 00:30:36,229
Up to now, she's just done
family stuff, you know.

516
00:30:36,317 --> 00:30:39,159
But... it's not just that
Halliwell confessed.

517
00:30:39,287 --> 00:30:41,438
He confessed
and he took you to the bodies.

518
00:30:41,526 --> 00:30:43,452
- How can that be a problem?
- I don't know.

519
00:30:43,916 --> 00:30:47,336
I mean, their side were looking
very confident.

520
00:30:47,424 --> 00:30:49,454
They're trying to paint me
as some sort of renegade

521
00:30:49,542 --> 00:30:50,829
acting outside of the law.

522
00:30:50,917 --> 00:30:52,854
But the judge has to see
through that.

523
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:23,001
I have considered the evidence
and oral submissions with care

524
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:26,336
and I find,
on the balance of probabilities,

525
00:31:26,424 --> 00:31:28,326
that the defendant's confession

526
00:31:28,413 --> 00:31:32,729
relating to the location
of Sian O'Callaghan's body

527
00:31:32,893 --> 00:31:34,614
may have been obtained
by oppression.

528
00:31:40,677 --> 00:31:43,870
With regard to
Becky Godden-Edwards,

529
00:31:43,957 --> 00:31:46,126
as soon as the defendant

530
00:31:46,214 --> 00:31:48,167
began to talk about
another offence,

531
00:31:48,255 --> 00:31:51,667
he should have been immediately
re-arrested and cautioned.

532
00:31:53,299 --> 00:31:56,985
The urgent interview criteria had,
at that point, expired.

533
00:31:57,073 --> 00:31:59,219
There should have been
no further discussion

534
00:31:59,307 --> 00:32:02,065
and the defendant should
have been taken to a police station.

535
00:32:02,153 --> 00:32:04,885
This whole series
of events

536
00:32:04,973 --> 00:32:08,325
began with a deliberate decision
by a senior officer

537
00:32:08,413 --> 00:32:10,117
to breach the PACE code.

538
00:32:10,674 --> 00:32:13,454
And whilst
Detective Superintendent Fulcher

539
00:32:13,542 --> 00:32:15,182
was entitled to adopt an approach

540
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:18,899
which would lead to the gathering
of intelligence and information,

541
00:32:18,987 --> 00:32:22,710
what resulted was not,
in my judgment,

542
00:32:22,798 --> 00:32:24,862
such as can fairly constitute

543
00:32:24,949 --> 00:32:28,077
admissible evidence
in a criminal trial.

544
00:32:41,925 --> 00:32:45,424
Yeah, well, he's going to have
to explain this at the trial.

545
00:32:45,767 --> 00:32:47,354
Are you all right?

546
00:33:00,564 --> 00:33:02,792
Er, good afternoon, everybody.

547
00:33:07,324 --> 00:33:10,741
So, the first thing to say
is that we should still be OK

548
00:33:10,828 --> 00:33:12,581
with the case against him for Sian.

549
00:33:12,687 --> 00:33:14,344
We have the DNA evidence.

550
00:33:14,432 --> 00:33:17,456
Her blood in his car,
his DNA on her body.

551
00:33:19,596 --> 00:33:21,263
And what about Becky?

552
00:33:25,311 --> 00:33:28,182
The confession evidence is all
we had.

553
00:33:28,931 --> 00:33:31,346
And, er, I'm afraid, without that,

554
00:33:31,434 --> 00:33:33,594
we'll have to take her name
off the indictment.

555
00:33:35,062 --> 00:33:36,159
What, you...?

556
00:33:36,388 --> 00:33:38,370
What, you mean he is not
going to stand trial

557
00:33:38,458 --> 00:33:40,138
for murdering my daughter?

558
00:33:41,807 --> 00:33:43,167
I'm sorry.

559
00:33:43,892 --> 00:33:45,891
Well, this is Fulcher's fault!

560
00:33:46,478 --> 00:33:48,557
He's fucked up here, he has!

561
00:33:50,912 --> 00:33:52,620
How can this be fair?

562
00:33:53,584 --> 00:33:55,583
Everybody knows he did it.

563
00:33:55,925 --> 00:33:59,516
That judge knows it. The lawyer
knows it. You know it. I know it.

564
00:33:59,604 --> 00:34:00,977
So how can that be right?

565
00:34:01,064 --> 00:34:03,760
Please, can you just tell me,
how can this be right?

566
00:34:09,601 --> 00:34:11,775
<i>Christopher
Halliwell was brought to court</i>

567
00:34:11,862 --> 00:34:13,235
<i>under police protection.</i>

568
00:34:13,322 --> 00:34:16,687
<i>The 47-year-old mini cab driver
is accused of killing Sian</i>

569
00:34:16,774 --> 00:34:19,216
<i>as she walked home alone
from a girls' night out.</i>

570
00:34:19,303 --> 00:34:21,542
<i>Come here, you!</i>

571
00:34:21,629 --> 00:34:23,845
<i>The police had asked them to stay calm</i>

572
00:34:23,932 --> 00:34:26,103
<i>and let the legal process
take its course.</i>

573
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:30,838
<i>But the strength of feeling
is etched on people's faces here.</i>

574
00:35:51,238 --> 00:35:53,394
Will the defendant please rise?

575
00:35:58,786 --> 00:36:00,346
Christopher John
Halliwell,

576
00:36:00,449 --> 00:36:04,042
you are charged that,
on March 19th, 2011,

577
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:08,391
you did murder Sian O'Callaghan,
contrary to common law.

578
00:36:08,772 --> 00:36:09,972
How do you plead?

579
00:36:17,538 --> 00:36:18,538
Guilty.

580
00:36:28,484 --> 00:36:29,621
Christopher John Halliwell,

581
00:36:29,716 --> 00:36:32,995
you have advanced little
by way of mitigation.

582
00:36:34,925 --> 00:36:38,189
I accept, however,
that your plea of guilty

583
00:36:38,386 --> 00:36:42,275
has avoided Sian's family
having to endure a trial,

584
00:36:42,565 --> 00:36:44,339
which is an important factor.

585
00:36:44,676 --> 00:36:48,675
Having careful regard to the overall
seriousness of this offence,

586
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:51,487
the starting point will be 30 years.

587
00:36:51,831 --> 00:36:56,744
However, I will allow a discount of
five years for your plea of guilty.

588
00:36:57,261 --> 00:37:00,058
I therefore rule that the minimum
term that you shall serve

589
00:37:00,167 --> 00:37:01,925
will be 25 years.

590
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:05,823
Take him down.

591
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:13,551
All rise.

592
00:37:17,484 --> 00:37:19,781
<i>Christopher
Halliwell could have been facing</i>

593
00:37:19,868 --> 00:37:22,189
<i>a jail term for murders of two women.</i>

594
00:37:22,276 --> 00:37:24,213
<i>Instead, he was given life for one</i>

595
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,706
<i>and, it appears,
escaped justice for another.</i>

596
00:37:39,182 --> 00:37:42,644
So, I came to apologise to you both.

597
00:37:42,899 --> 00:37:45,292
You have got nothing
to apologise for,

598
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:46,936
- Steve.
- Well...

599
00:37:47,194 --> 00:37:49,712
If you hadn't done what you did,
we'd never have found Becky.

600
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,816
Well...

601
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:52,753
..not everyone sees it
that way.

602
00:37:52,855 --> 00:37:54,249
What I can't understand

603
00:37:54,336 --> 00:37:58,334
is why nobody seems to be applying
any common sense here.

604
00:37:58,551 --> 00:38:00,681
Why would that lawyer
be fighting so hard

605
00:38:00,769 --> 00:38:02,197
to set free someone like Halliwell,

606
00:38:02,285 --> 00:38:04,924
who's admitted, himself,
that he killed two young girls?

607
00:38:05,511 --> 00:38:08,838
Why put all that effort
into defending someone who's guilty?

608
00:38:08,956 --> 00:38:10,946
Oh, I don't know, the principle, I guess.

609
00:38:11,034 --> 00:38:12,134
What principle?

610
00:38:12,222 --> 00:38:13,639
And what about justice?

611
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,838
They say that Halliwell
was oppressed by you.

612
00:38:17,105 --> 00:38:19,243
Well, I bet Becky and Sian
were oppressed by him

613
00:38:19,331 --> 00:38:21,213
just before he killed them, but...

614
00:38:21,871 --> 00:38:23,871
...that doesn't seem to matter, does it?

615
00:38:26,458 --> 00:38:28,433
Look, I've thought about this a lot
and...

616
00:38:29,088 --> 00:38:32,910
..if it's any consolation,
I can honestly say, hand on heart,

617
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:36,838
I wouldn't have done anything
different. I don't see how I could.

618
00:38:36,941 --> 00:38:39,339
We're behind you
one hundred percent, Steve.

619
00:38:39,448 --> 00:38:40,677
Mm.

620
00:38:40,816 --> 00:38:42,763
You brought my little girl
home.

621
00:38:43,471 --> 00:38:46,183
We can't thank you enough
for what you've done for us.

622
00:38:47,175 --> 00:38:48,441
Thank you.

623
00:38:49,339 --> 00:38:50,831
That does mean a lot to me.

624
00:38:58,518 --> 00:39:00,997
Contact the DVLA, madam,
and they'll deal with it.

625
00:39:01,328 --> 00:39:02,848
OK, all right. Thank you.

626
00:39:06,386 --> 00:39:07,605
Yes, sir?

627
00:39:08,145 --> 00:39:11,145
I want to make a complaint
about one of your police officers.

628
00:39:12,388 --> 00:39:13,587
His name...

629
00:39:14,186 --> 00:39:17,986
...is Detective Superintendent
Stephen Fulcher.

630
00:39:23,925 --> 00:39:26,838
Well, it's a complaint, Steve.
A complaint's a complaint.

631
00:39:27,041 --> 00:39:29,099
And as the lead for Professional
Standards for the force,

632
00:39:29,186 --> 00:39:30,299
I have to take it seriously.

633
00:39:30,386 --> 00:39:32,801
But half the stuff he's complaining
about is nothing to do with me.

634
00:39:32,888 --> 00:39:35,091
I mean, not being invited
to a press conference.

635
00:39:35,377 --> 00:39:38,470
Us calling her Becky Godden-Edwards,
not just Godden.

636
00:39:38,558 --> 00:39:39,485
I had no say in that.

637
00:39:39,573 --> 00:39:42,462
And the thing about my actions
preventing justice for Becky...

638
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:45,112
We wouldn't have found Becky
if it wasn't for my actions.

639
00:39:45,284 --> 00:39:47,916
Well, I'll have to make a decision
on whether to refer it to the IPCC

640
00:39:48,003 --> 00:39:51,124
and whether it constitutes
just misconduct or gross misconduct.

641
00:39:51,494 --> 00:39:53,494
- Really?
- Mm.

642
00:40:00,097 --> 00:40:01,194
- Ah.
- Steve.

643
00:40:01,375 --> 00:40:02,753
Sir, I need a word.

644
00:40:03,925 --> 00:40:05,370
- OK.
- Thanks.

645
00:40:30,251 --> 00:40:31,251
What is it?

646
00:40:31,925 --> 00:40:33,267
It's all clear.

647
00:40:34,084 --> 00:40:35,084
What is?

648
00:40:35,206 --> 00:40:36,769
I had a biopsy.

649
00:40:37,925 --> 00:40:40,391
- But you told me...
- It's benign.

650
00:40:46,711 --> 00:40:50,431
Don't you ever go through something
like that on your own again, hm?

651
00:40:57,769 --> 00:40:59,449
I just feel guilty.

652
00:41:00,977 --> 00:41:03,735
Guilty that it's me
who's been given another chance.

653
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,079
I'm sorry, sir, but it's bollocks.

654
00:41:11,202 --> 00:41:13,389
None of what he's complaining about
makes any sense.

655
00:41:13,476 --> 00:41:15,547
And, for most of his points,
I'm the wrong respondent.

656
00:41:15,634 --> 00:41:17,135
All right, leave it with me, Steve.

657
00:41:17,251 --> 00:41:19,523
- I'll have a quiet word with Mike.
- Would you?

658
00:41:19,838 --> 00:41:22,321
I'd appreciate that. Thanks.

659
00:41:26,028 --> 00:41:27,828
Oh, hello. Come in.

660
00:41:28,929 --> 00:41:30,249
Thanks.

661
00:41:31,935 --> 00:41:34,819
As you know, the case against Halliwell

662
00:41:34,907 --> 00:41:36,751
for Becky's murder collapsed in court.

663
00:41:38,125 --> 00:41:41,604
But at least we were able to answer
the mystery of her disappearance

664
00:41:41,932 --> 00:41:46,398
and end what must have been for you
the terrible pain of not knowing.

665
00:41:46,878 --> 00:41:50,224
Yes. And, for that,
we are very grateful to Steve Fulcher.

666
00:41:50,778 --> 00:41:53,715
The good news is that we were able
to convict Halliwell

667
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:54,946
for Sian's murder.

668
00:41:55,033 --> 00:41:59,549
And, as you know, he received a
sentence of 25 years' imprisonment.

669
00:41:59,636 --> 00:42:01,835
Yeah, minus the time
he's spent on remand.

670
00:42:02,125 --> 00:42:03,532
Yeah.

671
00:42:03,759 --> 00:42:06,696
Given that we do not have
enough evidence

672
00:42:06,814 --> 00:42:09,446
to convict Halliwell
for Becky's murder,

673
00:42:09,737 --> 00:42:13,737
Wiltshire Police Service
hopes that you are, er, satisfied...

674
00:42:14,568 --> 00:42:16,757
..that, were Halliwell
ever to be released,

675
00:42:16,845 --> 00:42:19,220
he would be a very, very old man.

676
00:42:19,746 --> 00:42:21,775
You see,
you don't understand me at all.

677
00:42:22,534 --> 00:42:25,665
Yes, Halliwell is going to be
in prison for a very long time,

678
00:42:25,761 --> 00:42:28,006
but not so long
that he won't ever get out.

679
00:42:28,094 --> 00:42:29,890
And Sian's family
have got justice.

680
00:42:29,978 --> 00:42:32,735
And I'm pleased for them.
Truly, I am.

681
00:42:32,845 --> 00:42:34,211
But where is Becky in the pecking order?

682
00:42:34,298 --> 00:42:36,227
She's right down at the bottom,
where's she's always been.

683
00:42:36,314 --> 00:42:39,329
How dare you trample over
my daughter?

684
00:42:40,525 --> 00:42:43,524
We're not gonna let go of this,
not one bit.

685
00:42:43,925 --> 00:42:46,485
Not till that man is made to pay
for what he did to my Becky.

686
00:42:46,573 --> 00:42:48,008
So you go back and you
tell your bosses,

687
00:42:48,095 --> 00:42:49,352
no,
I am not satisfied.

688
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,920
Not at all.

689
00:43:04,371 --> 00:43:05,696
Steve...

690
00:43:06,246 --> 00:43:07,725
I had a word with Mike.

691
00:43:08,212 --> 00:43:11,329
Unfortunately, he's already
referred it to the IPCC.

692
00:43:12,730 --> 00:43:14,384
They're going to charge you.

693
00:43:14,755 --> 00:43:16,314
Gross misconduct.

694
00:43:17,223 --> 00:43:18,525
Sorry.

695
00:43:23,502 --> 00:43:26,220
Fuck...
Fuck, fuck, fuck...

696
00:43:27,305 --> 00:44:27,250
