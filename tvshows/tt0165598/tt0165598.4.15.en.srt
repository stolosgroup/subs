1
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,040
Hey, guys. It is literally
a million degrees out.

2
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,200
I'm wearing shorts in January!

3
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,520
Have you ever seen
prettier legs on a fella?

4
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,280
Michael, we'll admire
your legs later.

5
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:21,960
Snow Prom is tomorrow. We need to keep up
our campaign for Snow Queen and Snow King.

6
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:25,200
Jackie, I did campaign.
I wrote our names all over the place.

7
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,440
Kelso, you peed in the snow.

8
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31,920
In cursive!

9
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,280
It was awesome.

10
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,680
Okay, look, you may not
take this seriously, but I do.

11
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,120
I used to be a rich,
popular girl.

12
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,160
But now that my dad
has cut me off, I'm not rich...

13
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,440
so I have to be
twice as popular.

14
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,280
Okay, maybe you should spend less time
worrying about being popular...

15
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,400
and more time being thoughtful,
friendly, considerate.

16
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,360
Okay, can I get a translation
because that was gibberish.

17
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,400
Come on, Michael.

18
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:01,400
Hey, you know what? We should all go
to Snow Prom together, in one car...

19
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:04,080
all of us hanging out,
laughing, driving.

20
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,040
Whoo-hoo!
Good times.

21
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,360
You need a ride, don't you?

22
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:12,280
I so do. Pick me up
at the radio station.

23
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,760
All right.
We'll all go together.

24
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,600
Whoa. Whoa. Hyde, you're
going to a school dance?

25
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,520
You're going to stink bomb
the teachers' lounge, aren't you? I want in!

26
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,560
No, man, kid stuff.

27
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,360
See, during the dance, I'm going to throw
a party in Coach Ferguson's office.

28
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,360
I'm bringing my best stuff.

29
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,360
A party with your best stuff?

30
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,760
Are you saying
what I think you're saying?

31
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:39,560
- You know it.
- Oh, boy, you have a piסata?

32
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,640
It's weird. I feel like I'm
forgetting something.

33
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:51,080
I've got my watch, my wallet,
my who-am-I-kidding condom.

34
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,920
Yeah, sounds like you got everything,
except for a tall redhead.

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,640
Yeah. What man
doesn't love a tall red...

36
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:05,400
Oh, my God, Donna!
I forgot Donna.

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,074

38
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:48,160
Mr. Hyde?
In school after hours?

39
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,680
What, are you trying to
establish an alibi?

40
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:00,760
Coach Ferguson, shouldn't you be on the
football field teaching boys to play with balls?

41
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,760
Don't push my buttons, wiseacre.

42
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,920
And there he goes.

43
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,720
I think now is a good time
to go fumigate his office.

44
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,760
Oh. I have exciting news
for you two.

45
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,560
Michael, you have been
elected Snow King.

46
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,640
Yeah!

47
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,680
And, Jackie, you are
the new Snow Queen runner-up!

48
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:30,360
Oh, my God!
This is the happiest day of my life!

49
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:33,400
Wait, runner-up?

50
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:38,640
How could that be?
There's been a mistake! It was fixed!

51
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,880
You poke me one more time,
I'm gonna paddle you.

52
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,720
That'd be hot.

53
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,360
I-I have a serious announcement.

54
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:54,200
A tornado warning has been issued.
I'm told it's code red.

55
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,320
I don't know the codes,
but red sounds serious.

56
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,240
Michael, this is
my worst nightmare.

57
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,720
A tornado is your worst nightmare?

58
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,440
Mine's monsters.

59
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,720
How could I be runner-up?

60
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,800
If I'm not a rich, popular girl,
I'm nothing.

61
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,360
I'm like Donna.

62
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,000
No, Jackie, you are the girlfriend
to the Snow King.

63
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,280
Now, as Snow King,
I must lead my people to safety.

64
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,920
All right, everyone!
Everyone, follow me!

65
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,320
Remain calm, people!
These are just sports balls!

66
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,240
Everyone grab a ball!

67
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,840
All right.

68
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,680
Now, I'm just so
worried about Eric.

69
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,520
A tornado in January?

70
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,800
Yeah, life's full of surprises.

71
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,080
Like these two showing up
'cause they don't have a basement.

72
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,920
Surprise!

73
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,720
Gee, Red, you seem grouchy.

74
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,240
Surprise!

75
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,680
Red, if Eric gets caught in a tornado,
he'll get blown to Canada.

76
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,880
He's very light.

77
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,160
Kitty, the gym is the town's
bomb shelter.

78
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,040
He'll be fine.

79
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,400
I just hope he's not crying.

80
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,960
Everybody knows he's my kid.

81
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,560
Okay, you're right.
Eric's fine.

82
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:14,600
Let's just talk about something else.

83
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:20,880
Ooh! You know, Joanne taught me a lot
about lady orgasms.

84
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,720
They've been around
longer than I thought.

85
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,720
Okay, so talking's bad.
I know, charades!

86
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,680
- No, thanks.
- What are you, chicken?

87
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:51,760
Did you just call me chicken?

88
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,040
That's it. Move the couch, Kitty.
She's going down.

89
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,720
Oh, yeah.

90
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,480
Busted, hophead.

91
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,960
People of the make-out stairwell...

92
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,400
this is your Snow King speaking.

93
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:30,960
Boo! Hit the lights, fool!

94
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:34,200
No, th-there's a tornado.
Everyone go to the gym.

95
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,560
The Snow King has spoken!

96
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,960
All right. That's gross.
Who threw the retainer?

97
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,120
Oh, my God, Fez!
A tornado?

98
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,640
This changes everything.
This could be our last night here on earth.

99
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,600
Oh, no. I'm going to die a virgin.

100
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,040
Not if I have anything
to say about it.

101
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,080
You can talk all you want,
but there's a tornado coming.

102
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,640
Fez, I mean, let's do it.

103
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:09,640
It?

104
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,600
"It" it?
All right.

105
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,560
I'm going to need you.

106
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,880
- Eric, you're here!
- Donna, look, I'm sorry I'm late.

107
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,840
I really did want to pick you up before
the dance. So it's no big deal, really.

108
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,960
No big deal?
It's a huge deal.

109
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:34,640
I was in back filing records, and suddenly
everyone was gone, and I was stuck here alone.

110
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,600
And you risked the tornado for me.

111
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,400
Tornado?

112
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:46,840
What tornado...

113
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,440
could stop me from helping you?

114
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:56,680
So, uh, tell me, um, is the tornado,
like, um... like, out there?

115
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,400
Yeah. They say it's a biggie.

116
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,560
- Oh.
- Eric, are you okay?

117
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,640
Sure.

118
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,280
Uh, it's just that now
that I know you're okay...

119
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,840
I can finally start
worrying about me.

120
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,440
And, see, the thing
about me is...

121
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,480
I don't want to die.

122
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:28,900
So, what to do?

123
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:36,740
Let's see, there's you,
there's me, candlelight.

124
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,740
You know, back in
the old days we would have...

125
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,980
- We're not doing that.
- Uh-huh, yeah, yeah.

126
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:48,220
So quick to dismiss the thing
you once ached for.

127
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:54,180
You mean, cheese sticks?

128
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,100
If you want to call it that, sure.

129
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:10,220
Gyrating.

130
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:13,620
Ehh, twisting. Uh...

131
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:16,620
Hips! You make me
feel like hips!

132
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:21,180
Uh, time!
We win.

133
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:25,180
I was dancing!

134
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:28,820
"You make me feel like hips"?

135
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,780
It could have been a song.

136
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:37,940
Is it hard to lose, Red?
'Cause you make it look so easy.

137
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,660
You're in big trouble, bud.

138
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,300
You should suspend me.

139
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:50,460
I need a vacation.

140
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:54,820
A tornado's coming.
It's code red.

141
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:58,540
You know what that means.
I think it's serious.

142
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:02,420
A tornado?

143
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,660
Deadly spirals of wind
really freak me out.

144
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:09,020
- All right, Coach Girlie. Calm down.
- I can't die yet!

145
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:12,420
There's so much
I haven't experienced.

146
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,100
I bet I know one thing
you haven't experienced.

147
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:25,260
Tornadoes get a bad rap, man.

148
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:27,700
It's not like the <i>Wizard of Oz.</i>

149
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:30,140
I mean, where are the midgets?

150
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:33,340
I bet I could bench,
like, 10 midgets.

151
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:36,940
Hey, look at all the stuff
you confiscated.

152
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:39,860
Mine. Mine.

153
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:44,060
Ooh, la, la.
Mine now.

154
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:48,260
Why am I not Snow Queen?

155
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:51,940
For the last two weeks,
I was nice to everybody.

156
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:56,580
Well, maybe not the A.V. Club,
but I mean, come on.

157
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:59,100
Jackie, you can't just
be nice for two weeks.

158
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:03,940
You have to be nice all the time.
Or very handsome.

159
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:06,900
Oh, my banana nose!

160
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:10,380
Oh. I thought this
was gone forever.

161
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:12,420
Ha. It's still funny!

162
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:16,380
Maybe Donna was right.

163
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:19,580
Maybe being popular isn't as important
as being nice to people.

164
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:24,660
I mean, I know that sounds wrong,
but anything's possible.

165
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:28,620
Hey, Jackie, whatever makes
you feel better about being a loser.

166
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:33,820
Hey, watch the banana nose!

167
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:41,380
Hey, Hyde, when this is all over,
you think we'll still be friends?

168
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:47,500
Well, my head says no,
but my heart says no.

169
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,860
So, no.

170
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:54,540
I wonder what Donna and Forman
are doing right now.

171
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:59,260
This is the best tornado ever!

172
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:03,980
I know! And who better to be stuck here with
than America's most beloved rock band...

173
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:06,700
ladies and gentlemen, Aerosmith!

174
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:13,020
Hey, as rock legends,
we've had some pretty good times.

175
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:16,340
But it doesn't get any better than this.
Hello, Wisconsin!

176
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:21,460
<i>Yeah, I dig this joint too.</i>
<i>Hello, Wisconsin.</i>

177
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,420
That was your Aerosmith?

178
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,380
You're bad at that.

179
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:30,700
Steven Tyler is way cooler,
and Joe Perry is so dreamy.

180
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:33,140
God, you're bad at that!

181
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:35,900
What? That was dead-on!
Right, guys?

182
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:40,900
I bought it.

183
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:46,060
You, uh, really think
I'm dreamy?

184
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:53,340
Whoa.

185
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:56,940
The station manager's stuff
is way better than ours.

186
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:00,860
Well, I lived my dream.
Let's go.

187
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:05,060
Oh, wait. We can't just
leave Jackie here like that.

188
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:07,100
You're right.

189
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,900
Okay, we're good.

190
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:24,860
Oh, Toto. Losing Snow Queen
has left me searching for guidance.

191
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:27,180
Surely, the Wizard of Oz can help.

192
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:34,060
Oh, well, Jackie, why'd you make me
the Scarecrow? He needs a brain.

193
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:37,460
No. No, I made you
the Scarecrow...

194
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:40,460
because you love chasing birds.

195
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:42,660
- I do love chasing birds.
- <i>Okay.</i>

196
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:51,780
Is this some kind of joke,
'cause I'm not laughing.

197
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:55,900
Kelso's the Scarecrow?
Yeah.

198
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:06,220
Look, guys! I'm a bear.

199
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,540
Fez, you're the Cowardly Lion.

200
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,500
But I want to be a bear.

201
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:18,140
- At least you got a brain.
- This sucks.

202
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:20,300
Oh, will everyone just shut up?

203
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:24,100
When it's your dream,
you can be whatever you want.

204
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,740
I want to be a bear.

205
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:32,340
Jackie, what the hell?

206
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:42,460
She totally made you a witch.
That's so awesome!

207
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,700
She made you a flying monkey.

208
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:46,660
What?

209
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:50,260
Oh, crap!

210
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:52,180
- Let's kick her ass!
- Yeah.

211
00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:00,140
Miss Wizard, I'm confused.
I lost Snow Queen.

212
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:02,940
And now I'm wondering
if titles and popularity...

213
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:05,780
aren't as important
as being a good person.

214
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:08,300
Well, how do you know
when you're a good person?

215
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:12,860
When everyone likes you, right?
When you're popular.

216
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:15,900
- And how do you know when you're popular?
- Oh, my God!

217
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:19,420
When you win titles like Snow Queen!

218
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:23,300
Winning titles and being a good person
are the same thing.

219
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:26,100
So you go after that title, child.

220
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:29,260
Oh, I will, Miss Wizard.
I will.

221
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:33,540
And remember, if someone calls
you shallow, they're just jealous.

222
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:37,380
<i>Just jealous. Jealous. Jealous.</i>

223
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:48,060
Ah, our own private stairwell.

224
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,980
This is exactly how I pictured
losing my virginity...

225
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:55,620
except it was
on a bed of flowers...

226
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:58,100
and there were two of you.

227
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:05,020
Tornado passed through,
is heading to Illinois.

228
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:07,740
Kiss my ass, Chicago!

229
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:13,660
Oh, my God!
We're-We're safe.

230
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,820
Sex just doesn't seem
important anymore.

231
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,740
I... I disagree.

232
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:25,020
And... And here's why.

233
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:28,300
Let's go celebrate with everyone.

234
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:34,980
Oh, you can make a tornado,
but you can't let me do it?

235
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:39,420
No, you are not a just God!

236
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,980
Okay.

237
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,460
No six.

238
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:48,820
No six. And...

239
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,460
six!

240
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:56,100
- Look, Park Place.
- Ah, Park Place.

241
00:17:56,180 --> 00:18:00,100
- Pay up.
- I told you we shouldn't spend all our money on Marvin Gardens.

242
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:07,180
Oh, and Baltic Avenue
was such a help.

243
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:11,580
I bought that with my
beauty-contest winnings.

244
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:17,020
Mmm. Poor Red, losing again.

245
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:21,140
While we have this
large housing development...

246
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:24,500
that I like to call Joanne Land.

247
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,500
Where's Red Land?

248
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:32,020
I'll tell you where it is.
It's right up your...

249
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,740
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Shh.

250
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:38,860
<i>This just in. The National Weather</i>
<i>Service has canceled the tornado warning.</i>

251
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:42,660
<i>And updating our top story,</i>
<i>a local teen is in critical condition...</i>

252
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:44,660
Oh, game over.
Call it a tie.

253
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:47,740
A tie?
We had all the money.

254
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:51,820
So? We had
the get-out-of-jail-free card.

255
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:54,300
And you can't put
a price on freedom.

256
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:57,500
Night, night.

257
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,700
Look, Jackie,
I know you're upset...

258
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:06,620
and I don't know why
you're not Snow Queen.

259
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:10,180
But I do know this:
I am Snow King.

260
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:15,100
So that's pretty cool.

261
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:20,420
Michael, I'm not upset.
I just had the best dream.

262
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,300
And now I've got to
campaign for next year.

263
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:25,340
Guys, how's my hair?

264
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:29,740
- Yeah, it's fantastic.
- Wonderful. Wonderful.

265
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:35,260
This was fun.
We haven't just hung out in, like, forever.

266
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:39,340
Plus, you're, like, my hero. Most guys would
not risk a tornado for an ex-girlfriend.

267
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:41,300
Yeah.

268
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:55,100
Wow.

269
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:59,580
Yeah, well, I just wanted to kiss you...

270
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:03,420
before you found out that I went to the dance,
forgot you and I didn't know about the tornado.

271
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:05,380
Okay, this was swell.

272
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:09,180
Wait, wait, wait.

273
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:11,260
So, you forgot me?

274
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:17,940
Okay, you're mad.

275
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:20,340
Actually, no.

276
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:22,460
I mean, if we were still dating,
I'd be super pissed.

277
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:25,780
But we're not, so it's kind of funny.

278
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:29,460
You know what?
Let me buy you a burger.

279
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:34,300
I can't believe you totally
snaked a kiss under false pretenses.

280
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:37,020
Yeah, I'm a little proud of that, yeah.

281
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:45,220
Well, I'm a lock for next year.

282
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,540
I introduced myself to everyone.

283
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:51,860
And I know they liked me, 'cause
they laughed at everything I said.

284
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:58,260
I mean, I even shook hands with that
nose-picking, chess-club guy.

285
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,660
Ooh, I'd better wash up.

286
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:06,300
- You ready?
- Yeah.

287
00:21:07,305 --> 00:22:07,797
