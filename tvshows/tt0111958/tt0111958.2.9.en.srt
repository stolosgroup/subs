Hello, Ted.
What are you listening to?

17
00:01:15,032 --> 00:01:20,025
Oh, it's just a programme about
the Church and God and so on.

00:01:20,111 --> 00:01:22,067
Oh, right. Right.

Where's Father Jack, Dougal?

20
00:01:27,709 --> 00:01:30,939
- Where's Father Jack?
- Yes.

Father Jack, where is he?

22

He's in his... Oh.

23
00:01:35,707 --> 00:01:39,494
- Erm...
- You've lost him again, right?

24
00:01:39,586 --> 00:01:41,895
I have, Ted, yeah.

25
00:01:41,986 --> 00:01:47,013
You took him out for a walk
and you lost him...again.

26
00:01:47,104 --> 00:01:49,618
That must've been
what happened all right.

27
00:01:49,704 --> 00:01:52,342
So what have you got to say
for yourself?

28
00:01:52,423 --> 00:01:55,573
Well, like I said the last time,
it won't happen again.

29
00:01:55,662 --> 00:01:58,335
Dougal, are you not going
to go and look for him?

30
00:01:58,422 --> 00:02:01,697
Ted, he'll come back.
What's the worst that can happen?

31
00:02:01,781 --> 00:02:04,135
He could have an accident
and be killed.

32
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:06,097
Oh.

33
00:02:07,899 --> 00:02:11,368
Er, wait a second, Ted.
Is that not Jack there?

34
00:02:11,458 --> 00:02:13,210
(Snoring)

35
00:02:13,298 --> 00:02:16,926
Ah, Dougal. You didn't even
get him out the door, did you?

36
00:02:17,017 --> 00:02:21,248
I thought the wheelchair felt
a bit lighter today all right.

37
00:02:22,416 --> 00:02:24,326
Come on, help me get him up.

- Dougal, take off his gloves.
- Right so, Ted.

41
00:02:36,212 --> 00:02:37,691
- Ted.
- Hmm?

42
00:02:37,772 --> 00:02:39,285
Ted, they're not gloves.

43
00:02:41,851 --> 00:02:46,207
God, they're very hairy hands
altogether, aren't they?

44
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:48,041
- What's wrong?
- I don't know.

45
00:02:48,129 --> 00:02:51,564
Do you remember the time
his head went septic?

46
00:02:51,648 --> 00:02:55,799
Yes. I mean, I didn't think
a whole head could go septic.

47
00:02:55,887 --> 00:02:58,037
I mean, a whole head, you know?

48
00:02:58,127 --> 00:03:01,596
But that's Jack for you.
I'd better look in the book.

49
00:03:07,644 --> 00:03:08,997
Right.

50
00:03:11,084 --> 00:03:13,199
Hold his hand up there, Dougal.

51
00:03:14,323 --> 00:03:18,474
Well, he got up to stage four
after drinking that brake fluid.

52
00:03:18,562 --> 00:03:20,791
I think this could be a stage six.

53
00:03:20,881 --> 00:03:23,917
- Hello to the lot of yous.
- Hello, Mrs Doyle.

54
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,992
Ah, would you look at him there
with his hairy hands?

55
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:31,628
Yes, and we're going
to have to call Dr Sinnot.

56
00:03:31,718 --> 00:03:34,596
He's good. I had to go myself
a couple of weeks ago.

57
00:03:34,678 --> 00:03:37,669
Really? I didn't know you were ill.
What was the trouble?

58
00:03:37,757 --> 00:03:40,953
A bit of a woman's problem.
I was having a bit of trouble...

59
00:03:41,036 --> 00:03:43,630
I'd better ring him
before it's too late!

60
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:47,113
(Phone buzzes )

61
00:03:50,994 --> 00:03:53,826
- So it's the hairy hands.
- Yes.

62
00:03:53,913 --> 00:03:56,426
- A stage six?
- It looks like it, yeah.

63
00:03:56,512 --> 00:03:58,468
I'll get ready upstairs.

64
00:03:59,392 --> 00:04:01,541
Ted, why is Jack
so scared of doctors?

65
00:04:01,631 --> 00:04:06,101
They remind him of illness
and his own mortality.

66
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:07,986
He hated visiting the sick.

67
00:04:08,069 --> 00:04:11,823
Oh, God, he hates the sick.
And the poor as well.

68
00:04:11,908 --> 00:04:14,547
- The poor really got on his nerves.
- And the needy.

69
00:04:14,628 --> 00:04:16,345
(Sighing) Them as well.

70
00:04:16,427 --> 00:04:19,578
What was it he used to say?
He had a term for them.

71
00:04:19,667 --> 00:04:22,226
- A shower of bastards.
- That was it.

72
00:04:22,306 --> 00:04:25,217
When we bring the doctor in,
just behave normal.

73
00:04:25,305 --> 00:04:27,614
Just pretend he's a normal visitor.

74
00:04:27,705 --> 00:04:29,979
We don't want Jack
to suspect anything.

75
00:04:30,064 --> 00:04:31,622
Doctor? Ready?

76
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:34,661
All right, in you go. Remember...

77
00:04:34,743 --> 00:04:36,653
completely normal.

78
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:42,850
So it's off to St Clabbert's
again, Doctor?

79
00:04:42,941 --> 00:04:44,498
Yes.

80
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,810
It's more for your sake than for his.

81
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,811
That hair thing
can be very contagious.

82
00:04:50,899 --> 00:04:53,810
- How long will they have him?
- Hard to say.

83
00:04:53,898 --> 00:04:57,890
Could be for a while.
Actually, you should be prepared.

84
00:04:57,977 --> 00:05:01,446
It might be better for
his own sake if he doesn't come back.

85
00:05:01,536 --> 00:05:03,492
Great! I mean, oh, no.

86
00:05:04,775 --> 00:05:07,653
We'll just have
to grin and bear it, I suppose.

87
00:05:07,735 --> 00:05:11,044
I'll try and break it to him gently.
Thanks, Doctor.

88
00:05:17,292 --> 00:05:20,045
Yes! Wahey!

89
00:05:28,569 --> 00:05:30,446
Father Jack?

90
00:05:30,529 --> 00:05:34,362
Do you remember that great time
you had at St Clabbert's?

91
00:05:36,887 --> 00:05:41,084
Remember the fun you had with
those nuns fussing about you?

92
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:45,716
Dr Sinnot thinks another spell
there would do a world of good.

93
00:05:45,805 --> 00:05:49,194
Ok, it might mean giving up
the odd glass of sherry or two,

94
00:05:49,284 --> 00:05:51,161
but that's all for your own good.

95
00:05:51,244 --> 00:05:52,995
You'll have a fantastic time,

96
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:56,597
it'll be one big laugh with
all those nuns fussing all the...

97
00:05:56,682 --> 00:05:58,115
Father? Father?

98
00:05:58,202 --> 00:06:00,999
Where's he gone?

99
00:06:01,081 --> 00:06:02,400
(Motor chugging)

100
00:06:11,799 --> 00:06:15,393
God, Ted, how did the sergeant
catch Father Jack at all?

101
00:06:15,478 --> 00:06:17,035
Well, Dougal...

102
00:06:17,117 --> 00:06:21,632
He's an elderly priest driving
a Flymo around a small island.

103
00:06:21,716 --> 00:06:23,468
How hard could it be?

104
00:06:23,556 --> 00:06:26,388
Anyway, he's up there
in St Clabbert's now.

105
00:06:26,475 --> 00:06:29,147
It's weird the way
you get used to something.

106
00:06:29,234 --> 00:06:32,510
Seems like only yesterday he was
here drinking his head off.

107
00:06:36,712 --> 00:06:38,782
Dougal, it was yesterday.

108
00:06:38,872 --> 00:06:42,341
Yeah, but that's why I said
it SEEMED like yesterday.

109
00:06:43,471 --> 00:06:45,700
Right, because it WAS yesterday.

110
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:49,941
Yeah. What time are Father Rory
and Father k en coming on Wednesday?

111
00:06:50,029 --> 00:06:51,667
About six.

112
00:06:51,749 --> 00:06:53,704
Six o'clock?

113
00:06:56,228 --> 00:06:58,900
- Yes.
- Right. Good, good.

114
00:06:58,987 --> 00:07:01,819
Actually, it's just as well
Jack's not here.

115
00:07:01,906 --> 00:07:04,466
He can get very irritable
around strangers.

116
00:07:04,546 --> 00:07:06,900
Jack was very bad around strangers.

117
00:07:06,985 --> 00:07:09,179
And people he knew.

118
00:07:10,584 --> 00:07:13,541
Yes, very bad around strangers
and people he knew.

119
00:07:14,623 --> 00:07:17,534
- Anyway, night, Dougal.
- Night, Ted.

120
00:07:19,822 --> 00:07:21,777
(Ted) Aw, damn!

121
00:07:31,019 --> 00:07:32,532
(Whistling)

122
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:36,770
No, Dougal, it's not morning.
I forgot to wind the clock.

123
00:07:36,858 --> 00:07:39,576
Oh, right. Sorry about that, Ted.

124
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:08,922
Hello there, Father...

125
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:11,204
Father... Who are you?

126
00:08:11,289 --> 00:08:12,563
Who are you?

127
00:08:12,649 --> 00:08:15,765
Father Ted Crilly.
Very pleased to meet you.

128
00:08:15,848 --> 00:08:17,997
Oh. What's this?

129
00:08:20,607 --> 00:08:22,562
Oh, I see. It's from the Bishop.

130
00:08:22,646 --> 00:08:25,001
You're taking Father Jack's place.

131
00:08:25,086 --> 00:08:28,202
This is a surprise.
Has Mrs Doyle shown you around?

132
00:08:30,764 --> 00:08:32,880
Well, anyway,
welcome to Craggy Island.

133
00:08:32,964 --> 00:08:35,921
The meals are at 11,
one, half-two, three,

134
00:08:36,003 --> 00:08:37,674
five, seven and nine.

135
00:08:37,762 --> 00:08:41,470
And if you ever want a snack,
you can ask Mrs Doyle.

136
00:08:42,961 --> 00:08:46,111
No, er... No, actually,
that's actually mine.

137
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,512
Well, you go ahead there
and have it anyway.

138
00:08:52,119 --> 00:08:54,188
Dougal, this is Father Fintan Stack.

139
00:08:54,278 --> 00:08:56,109
He'll be staying with us now.

140
00:08:56,198 --> 00:08:58,074
Oh, right, yeah.

141
00:08:58,157 --> 00:09:00,432
This is the brains of the operation.

142
00:09:00,517 --> 00:09:02,268
Ah, no, that'd be Ted.

143
00:09:03,636 --> 00:09:05,467
I wanna listen to some music.

144
00:09:05,555 --> 00:09:07,034
Oh, go ahead, there.

145
00:09:07,115 --> 00:09:09,787
I wasn't asking for permission.

146
00:09:11,674 --> 00:09:13,629
( # Jungle music)

147
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:28,547
( # Muffled thumping music)

148
00:09:35,148 --> 00:09:37,945
So, erm... What do you think
of Father Stack?

149
00:09:38,027 --> 00:09:39,619
Well, erm...

150
00:09:39,707 --> 00:09:44,734
It says in his note that they never
found a suitable parish for him.

151
00:09:46,465 --> 00:09:50,252
- He's not a very nice man, is he?
- I've never met anyone like him.

152
00:09:50,344 --> 00:09:53,780
Who would he be like?
Hitler or one of those mad fellows?

153
00:09:55,143 --> 00:09:56,622
Oh, worse than Hitler.

154
00:09:56,703 --> 00:10:00,900
You wouldn't find Hitler playing
jungle music at three in the morning.

155
00:10:00,982 --> 00:10:03,620
God, he almost makes Jack
seem normal.

156
00:10:03,701 --> 00:10:05,373
You know, he nearly does.

157
00:10:05,461 --> 00:10:07,132
(Howling)

158
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,333
Right, carry on.

159
00:10:11,419 --> 00:10:14,216
I was going to say
you'd almost miss Father Jack.

160
00:10:14,298 --> 00:10:16,175
He had his funny little ways.

161
00:10:16,258 --> 00:10:19,966
But whenever he'd hit you,
he'd never do it out of spite.

162
00:10:20,057 --> 00:10:21,570
He'd only do it because...

163
00:10:21,657 --> 00:10:23,965
he thought it was funny or whatever.

164
00:10:24,056 --> 00:10:27,206
I suppose when you think about it
now, it was funny.

165
00:10:28,455 --> 00:10:31,969
Remember that time he gave you
a big kick up the b-o-t-t-y?

166
00:10:33,934 --> 00:10:37,050
And do you remember
when you were bending over him,

167
00:10:37,133 --> 00:10:42,569
and he held your nose so tight
that you had to open your mouth

168
00:10:42,651 --> 00:10:45,006
and then he dropped
a big spider in it?

169
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:49,006
No, that wasn't funny, Dougal.

170
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:51,523
It was funny when
he kicked you up the arse.

171
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:54,486
It wasn't funny when he put
the spider in my mouth.

172
00:10:54,568 --> 00:10:57,958
- It was, Ted.
- No, it wasn't, Dougal!

173
00:10:58,048 --> 00:11:00,163
- Ah, Ted.
- Dougal!

174
00:11:00,247 --> 00:11:02,396
Anyway, he's gone now.

175
00:11:03,806 --> 00:11:06,683
It's funny how you miss
someone's little ways.

176
00:11:06,765 --> 00:11:08,244
(Sighing)

177
00:11:20,242 --> 00:11:21,721
(Sighing)

178
00:11:23,761 --> 00:11:25,035
(Screaming)

179
00:11:47,115 --> 00:11:49,345
( # Muffled jungle continues )

180
00:11:50,914 --> 00:11:53,030
God, I've had enough.

181
00:11:53,114 --> 00:11:56,583
It sounds like someone drilling
holes in a wall or something.

182
00:11:56,673 --> 00:11:58,628
- I'll have a word.
- Careful.

183
00:12:11,669 --> 00:12:12,943
Come on, I think he's out.

184
00:12:13,029 --> 00:12:15,496
- What's up, Ted?
- Ted's gone mad.

185
00:12:15,588 --> 00:12:17,738
- Lead on, MacTed!
- Shh.

186
00:12:20,227 --> 00:12:23,457
- Right, the coast is clear.
- Father Jack's not here?

187
00:12:23,546 --> 00:12:26,742
No, he has the hair thing again.
He's in Jurassic Park.

188
00:12:26,825 --> 00:12:31,614
Oh, right. St Clabbert's.
Father Walton's up there, I hear.

189
00:12:31,704 --> 00:12:33,660
- Sherry all right?
- Lovely.

190
00:12:33,744 --> 00:12:36,177
Did you know Father Coogan
at all, Ted?

191
00:12:36,263 --> 00:12:40,653
Hmm... Oh, yes. Father Tom Coogan.
Wasn't he in Africa?

192
00:12:40,742 --> 00:12:43,380
He was, with Father Shortall
and that load.

193
00:12:43,461 --> 00:12:45,179
Then he was back in Wicklow.

194
00:12:45,261 --> 00:12:48,332
I think Windy Shepherd Henderson
was his priest there.

195
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:51,172
Windy Shepherd Henderson
that was in Tralee?

196
00:12:51,259 --> 00:12:53,534
No, a different
Windy Shepherd Henderson.

197
00:12:53,619 --> 00:12:55,768
- There's four of them.
- At least.

198
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:58,691
One of them was with
Father Daley in Chicago.

199
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:03,247
Wasn't he the first man on the
scene when Malcom X was assassinated?

200
00:13:03,336 --> 00:13:05,054
No, that was Father Burke.

201
00:13:05,136 --> 00:13:08,525
Father Daley had the lump on
his head in the shape of Connaught.

202
00:13:08,615 --> 00:13:12,812
Like Father Caroline - he lost
the use of his ears in an accident.

203
00:13:12,894 --> 00:13:16,010
- He's deaf?
- No, just lost the use of his ears.

204
00:13:16,093 --> 00:13:18,129
He used to be able to wiggle them.

205
00:13:18,213 --> 00:13:20,851
Remember Father O'Reilly?
He's in Clare.

206
00:13:20,932 --> 00:13:24,560
They moved him after he owned up
to that OJ Simpson thing.

207
00:13:25,451 --> 00:13:28,283
Father Bigley from Ardee
did his wedding, I think.

208
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:31,964
- Father Bigley? Is he not dead?
- No, he just looked dead.

209
00:13:32,049 --> 00:13:34,722
Ted, did you say
Father Larry Duff was coming?

210
00:13:34,809 --> 00:13:36,719
God, I'd better give him a call.

211
00:13:36,808 --> 00:13:40,197
I hope he can make it.
Larry is tremendous fun.

212
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:47,321
(Mobile phone )

213
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:53,436
Ahh!

214
00:13:55,164 --> 00:13:57,358
No, he must have it turned off.

215
00:13:58,723 --> 00:14:00,474
God, I wonder where Dougal is?

216
00:14:00,562 --> 00:14:03,837
Come on, Ted.
Shall we watch the sports video?

217
00:14:03,921 --> 00:14:06,355
Oh, yes. Come on, Ted.

218
00:14:06,441 --> 00:14:09,432
Ah, here's the lads.
And away they go!

219
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,837
Ah, look at your man at the back!

220
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:15,476
I remember this.

221
00:14:15,558 --> 00:14:18,356
(All cheering)

222
00:14:20,837 --> 00:14:23,555
(All) Look at Mrs Doyle!

223
00:14:23,636 --> 00:14:26,946
- She looks great on the telly!
- She's wearing the hat for a bet!

224
00:14:27,036 --> 00:14:29,833
(Ted) I'd say so.
Oh, here's Buckin' Bronco!

225
00:14:31,594 --> 00:14:33,550
Or Hopalong Cassidy.

226
00:14:33,634 --> 00:14:39,230
- Here's the champ.
- Fair play. Fair play to him.

227
00:14:39,313 --> 00:14:41,064
(Cheering)

228
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:47,421
What are we watching?

229
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:49,387
We're looking at the sports day.

230
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:52,506
Lots of young fellows
running around in shorts.

231
00:14:52,589 --> 00:14:55,625
That's the kind of thing
you like looking at.

232
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:57,664
And I bet you like that, too.

233
00:14:57,748 --> 00:15:01,706
You're probably imagining
what they'd look like without shorts.

234
00:15:01,787 --> 00:15:04,254
You're sitting there, imagining that,

235
00:15:04,346 --> 00:15:06,860
with a big smile on your face.

236
00:15:07,745 --> 00:15:09,701
You dirty fecker.

237
00:15:11,425 --> 00:15:14,575
If you're trying to embarrass us,
you're not succeeding.

238
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:16,733
Yes, I am.

239
00:15:16,823 --> 00:15:20,610
Well, I have to say,
I think that you're a very rude man.

240
00:15:20,702 --> 00:15:23,455
If you ever say that to me again,

241
00:15:23,542 --> 00:15:26,214
I'll put your head through the wall.

242
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,769
(Crashing)

243
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:34,295
- Dougal, where did you go to?
- Ted! How are you?

244
00:15:34,379 --> 00:15:36,812
- Dougal, what the...?
- Yes? What, Ted?

245
00:15:36,898 --> 00:15:38,934
- What?
- What?

246
00:15:39,018 --> 00:15:41,247
- Have you been drinking?
- I have, Ted.

247
00:15:41,337 --> 00:15:43,487
I been drinking like a mad eejit.

248
00:15:44,856 --> 00:15:46,084
No, no, wait.

249
00:15:49,575 --> 00:15:50,690
No, I haven't.

250
00:15:50,775 --> 00:15:52,651
Dougal, I'm ashamed of you.

251
00:15:52,734 --> 00:15:56,282
Ted, Ted, Ted.
Come here, Teddy, Teddy, Ted.

252
00:15:56,373 --> 00:16:00,604
You're my best friend.
God, I love being a priest.

253
00:16:00,692 --> 00:16:03,889
We're all going to heaven,
lads, wahey!

254
00:16:05,651 --> 00:16:07,209
Perhaps I should explain.

255
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:12,079
Your friend and I were enjoying
a bottle of whisky I found upstairs.

256
00:16:12,169 --> 00:16:14,478
Well, that is the last straw.

257
00:16:14,569 --> 00:16:18,038
I'm driving. I'm driving home,
I'm perfectly capable.

258
00:16:18,128 --> 00:16:20,402
By the way,
I got the keys of your car

259
00:16:20,487 --> 00:16:22,842
and I drove it into a big wall.

260
00:16:22,927 --> 00:16:25,565
If you don't like it, tough.

261
00:16:25,646 --> 00:16:29,001
I had my fun
and that's all that matters.

262
00:16:29,085 --> 00:16:32,077
- Ted, I can see up your trousers.
- Right. That's it.

263
00:16:32,164 --> 00:16:35,395
I thought giving alcohol
to Dougal was the last straw,

264
00:16:35,484 --> 00:16:37,474
but it was the second last straw,

265
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:40,952
because this is definitely the last
bit of straw in...the thing.

266
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:43,033
There is no more straw left!

267
00:16:43,122 --> 00:16:46,397
- Ted, it's a little late.
- Yes, I think we should go.

268
00:16:46,481 --> 00:16:49,313
- No, you don't have to go.
- I think we should.

269
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,550
Woooo!

270
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,595
Bye, girls!

271
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:54,953
Pair of wankers.

272
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:59,634
Oh! Come on, Dougal, we've had enough
of Father Stack for one evening.

273
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:01,514
To the pub, Ted!

274
00:17:01,597 --> 00:17:03,315
( # Jungle music)

275
00:17:37,228 --> 00:17:40,504
- Hey, Ted, what's going on?
- We're going to kidnap Jack.

276
00:17:40,587 --> 00:17:43,624
kidnapping, wow!
What will we get for him?

277
00:17:43,707 --> 00:17:46,982
- Shut up, Dougal. You ready?
- I'm with you, Ted.

278
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,817
Right so, let's go, then.

279
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:53,860
(Doorbell)

280
00:17:55,424 --> 00:17:57,175
Hello?

281
00:18:03,742 --> 00:18:05,493
- This is a bit mad, Ted.
- Shh!

282
00:18:05,581 --> 00:18:07,936
Why don't we ask the nuns
to give him back?

283
00:18:08,021 --> 00:18:10,898
Dr Sinnot said
moving him might be dangerous.

284
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,731
Anyway, I got a second opinion.

285
00:18:12,819 --> 00:18:15,014
- Who from?
- Mrs Doyle.

286
00:18:15,099 --> 00:18:18,977
Ted, I'm not sure if this
is a good idea. I mean, kidnapping!

287
00:18:19,058 --> 00:18:22,333
It's not kidnapping, it's bringing
him back to where he belongs.

288
00:18:22,417 --> 00:18:26,250
It's like Lassie Come Home,
with Father Jack as Lassie.

289
00:18:26,336 --> 00:18:29,725
- Who are we, then?
- I don't konw. The other people.

290
00:18:29,815 --> 00:18:32,329
You're Roddy McDowell
and I'm Liz Taylor.

291
00:18:32,415 --> 00:18:36,043
Fine. I just wanted to get that
straight in me head.

292
00:18:36,134 --> 00:18:38,089
- Right, let's go.
- Right.

293
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:47,482
- Come on, Dougal.
- (Shouting) Right behind you!

294
00:18:47,571 --> 00:18:49,162
Shut up! k eep it quiet.

295
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:52,003
Look around
and see if there's a light switch.

296
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:54,045
(All shouting)

297
00:18:57,528 --> 00:18:58,927
(Silence )

298
00:18:59,008 --> 00:19:02,556
- (Nun ) What's all that noise?!
- Quick, Dougal, here.

299
00:19:09,085 --> 00:19:11,076
(Nun ) Calm down, all of you!

300
00:19:11,165 --> 00:19:13,917
Some people
are trying to get some sleep!

301
00:19:16,244 --> 00:19:18,199
Arse! Feck! Oh!

302
00:19:35,479 --> 00:19:38,038
Dougal, that's not Father Jack.

303
00:19:41,078 --> 00:19:42,874
- Hello, Father Walton.
- Feck off!

304
00:19:42,957 --> 00:19:47,313
- Will he not do, Ted?
- No. I don't think so, no.

305
00:19:47,396 --> 00:19:50,705
A stage 12.
I never thought I'd see one.

306
00:19:50,795 --> 00:19:53,308
Ah, Ted, can we not keep him?

307
00:19:53,394 --> 00:19:55,828
No. Come on, let's get Father Jack.

308
00:19:57,074 --> 00:19:59,792
- You got the torch, Dougal?
- Yes.

309
00:19:59,873 --> 00:20:01,430
- Arse!

314
00:20:06,671 --> 00:20:09,662
(Posh voice )
I really shouldn't be here.

315
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,024

324
00:20:40,383 --> 00:20:42,179
(Jack whimpering)

325
00:20:45,542 --> 00:20:49,658
- Jumping on my picture again?
- You got a problem with that?

326
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:52,857
- None. Enjoy yourself.
- What was all that noise?

327
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:55,612
That's Father Jack,
the fellow you replaced.

328
00:20:55,699 --> 00:20:58,132
Tell him to get lost. I'm here now.

329
00:20:58,218 --> 00:21:01,210
You might like the pleasure
of telling him yourself.

330
00:21:01,298 --> 00:21:03,333
And what happened to his whisky.

331
00:21:03,417 --> 00:21:05,612
(Shattering glass, screaming)

332
00:21:05,696 --> 00:21:07,015
He'll fill you in.

333
00:21:07,096 --> 00:21:08,973
I'm supposed to be scared?

334
00:21:09,056 --> 00:21:10,283
Drink!

335
00:21:25,292 --> 00:21:28,681
- Listen to that, Dougal.
- I don't hear anything.

336
00:21:28,771 --> 00:21:31,682
That's what I mean.
The sound of silence.

337
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:34,408
No, I still don't hear anything.

338
00:21:34,489 --> 00:21:39,243
I'm sorry I didn't disinfect
Jack's chair like you told me.

339
00:21:39,328 --> 00:21:42,000
It's my fault
that lad got the hair thing.

340
00:21:42,087 --> 00:21:45,841
Don't worry. I'm sure he's fine
up in Jurassic Park.

341
00:21:45,926 --> 00:21:48,645
Best place for him.
k eep him out of trouble.

342
00:21:48,726 --> 00:21:51,478
Anyway, how are we getting on
in there, Father?

343
00:21:51,565 --> 00:21:53,795
It's a great invention, isn't it?

344
00:21:53,885 --> 00:21:55,681
And no more St Clabbert's.

345
00:21:55,764 --> 00:21:59,153
(Muffled) Drink! Drink! Drink!

346
00:21:59,243 --> 00:22:02,120
Anyway, time for bed.
Come on, Dougal.

347
00:22:02,202 --> 00:22:07,070
(Muffled) Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink!

348
00:22:07,161 --> 00:22:12,234

(Man on loudhailer)
'Fathers, please. Calm down.

351
00:22:23,157 --> 00:22:27,115
'Someone step in there, please.
That really is not on.

352
00:22:27,196 --> 00:22:28,993
'You're ruining it.

353
00:22:29,076 --> 00:22:31,635
'Sister, if you could just
step in there.'

354
00:22:36,154 --> 00:22:38,713
Break it up, break it up, Fathers.

355
00:22:38,793 --> 00:22:40,704
Break it up.

356
00:22:40,793 --> 00:22:41,942
Put that down.

357
00:22:44,032 --> 00:22:48,183
(Men ) Drink! Arse! Drink!
Feck! Girls! Drink! Arse!
