2
00:00:36,939 --> 00:00:40,488
Here we go, Dougal, 22, 23...
This is us.

3
00:00:40,579 --> 00:00:42,330
We should've got a window seat.

4
00:00:42,418 --> 00:00:44,852
No, Father, you sit over there.

5
00:00:44,938 --> 00:00:46,849
(Bottles clanking)

6
00:00:46,938 --> 00:00:49,133
I'd be too nervous
to sit by the window.

7
00:00:49,218 --> 00:00:52,050
- Why is that?
- I've never liked flying.

8
00:00:52,137 --> 00:00:55,846
If God wanted us to fly,
He'd put airports nearer the city.

9
00:00:55,937 --> 00:00:59,849
Excuse me, Father,
you're sitting on my cardigan.

10
00:00:59,936 --> 00:01:01,608
(Wheezing)

11
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:04,574
Could you... Could you not
breathe like that?

12
00:01:04,656 --> 00:01:06,486
You're making a noise.

13
00:01:06,575 --> 00:01:09,726
Now, really, Father,
this is a no-smoking flight.

14
00:01:14,534 --> 00:01:18,288
- So, did you enjoy yourself?
- Oh, I did. kilnettle's great.

15
00:01:18,374 --> 00:01:21,172
It must be the holiest shrine
in the world.

16
00:01:21,254 --> 00:01:23,642
Top ten, anyway.

17
00:01:23,733 --> 00:01:27,282
Funny, Our Lady appearing
on a golf course like that.

18
00:01:27,373 --> 00:01:31,001
- Where exactly did it happen?
- On the 13th hole.

19
00:01:31,092 --> 00:01:33,322
She appeared to a fellow
on the green.

20
00:01:33,412 --> 00:01:36,722
He was putting for a birdie
and the ball hit her foot.

21
00:01:36,812 --> 00:01:39,086
God Almighty. Then what?

22
00:01:39,171 --> 00:01:42,959
He just took a dropped ball
and put it down to experience.

23
00:01:43,051 --> 00:01:45,360
Hello, Ted. On the old plane, I see.

24
00:01:45,451 --> 00:01:47,281
I am, yes.

25
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:49,326
Same as yourself.

26
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:55,329
Who was that, Ted?

27
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:59,004
That's Father Joe Briefly,
a pal of mine from St Colum's.

28
00:01:59,089 --> 00:02:01,683
We used to have
a nickname for him there...

29
00:02:01,769 --> 00:02:03,566
Oh, yes, very funny.

30
00:02:03,649 --> 00:02:06,321
We used to call him Himalaya Joe.

31
00:02:06,408 --> 00:02:09,366
He had all this hair
growing between his toes.

32
00:02:09,448 --> 00:02:12,405
Like the Abominable Snowman.
Very funny.

33
00:02:12,487 --> 00:02:14,443
And did you have a nickname, Ted?

34
00:02:14,527 --> 00:02:16,722
No, I didn't.

35
00:02:16,807 --> 00:02:18,877
- You must have had one.
- No!

36
00:02:18,967 --> 00:02:21,799
- Father Briefly!
- Dougal!

37
00:02:21,886 --> 00:02:25,356
Father, do you remember
Ted's nickname at St Colum's?

38
00:02:25,446 --> 00:02:27,880
Let's see, what's that it was?

39
00:02:27,966 --> 00:02:30,763
Don't worry, Joe,
I'll tell him myself.

40
00:02:30,845 --> 00:02:32,324
Shut up, Dougal.

41
00:02:36,485 --> 00:02:38,759
It was...

42
00:02:38,844 --> 00:02:40,516
Father Fluffybottom.

43
00:02:40,604 --> 00:02:43,596
Some of the priests
caught a glance of my rear end

44
00:02:43,684 --> 00:02:46,561
in the showers
after a game of football.

45
00:02:46,643 --> 00:02:52,673
Well, I had all this downy fluff
growing around that whole area.

46
00:02:52,763 --> 00:02:56,437
Oh, yes. Father Fluffybottom.
Hilarious stuff.

47
00:02:56,522 --> 00:02:58,752
What did you do in the end?
Shave it off?

48
00:03:00,402 --> 00:03:02,961
Shave it off? No, not at all.

49
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:04,554
Oh, right.

50
00:03:04,641 --> 00:03:06,996
- Father Briefly!
- Dougal!

51
00:03:07,081 --> 00:03:10,117
It was Father Fluffybottom!

52
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,838
Oh, yes, that's right.

53
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,515
Because he had this big load
of fluffy hair on his behind.

54
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,351
What did you do in the end, Ted?
Shave it off?

55
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:23,829
No, I didn't. You can't get
razors with handles long enough

56
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:26,114
to reach down...to your behind.

57
00:03:27,078 --> 00:03:30,229
Remember what they called you?
Himalaya Joe.

58
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:33,947
Because of all the thick black
hair growing between your toes.

59
00:03:36,197 --> 00:03:38,631
That was actually
a medical condition.

60
00:03:42,237 --> 00:03:43,464
Heh heh.

61
00:03:48,476 --> 00:03:52,150
'This is your pilot speaking.
Fasten your seat belts for take-off.'

62
00:03:52,955 --> 00:03:56,311
Oh! What the...? Who did that?

63
00:03:58,675 --> 00:04:01,825
Someone messing there.
What did you get, Dougal?

64
00:04:01,914 --> 00:04:04,986
I got this at the gift shop
back at the airport.

65
00:04:06,874 --> 00:04:09,182
But Dougal,
we have a tape dispenser.

66
00:04:09,273 --> 00:04:13,471
- Why'd you buy that one?
- This is no ordinary one. Watch.

67
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:18,381
(Recording) 'You have used one
inch of sticky tape. God bless you.'

68
00:04:19,032 --> 00:04:21,182
Dougal, that is absolutely brilliant.

69
00:04:21,272 --> 00:04:24,104
Already I can think of
hundreds of uses for it.

70
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:26,261
- Get anything else?
- I did, yeah. Look.

71
00:04:26,871 --> 00:04:30,386
- What's it do?
- Squeeze it, it's a joke telephone.

72
00:04:31,111 --> 00:04:32,862
(Squeaks )

73
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:36,778
Dougal, this is a dog toy.

74
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:39,430
What? No, it's not.
It's a joke telephone.

75
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:42,467
Dougal, this is a toy for dogs.

76
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:45,621
This is something people
give their dogs on their birthday.

77
00:04:45,709 --> 00:04:48,382
Seriously, Ted.
It's a joke telephone.

78
00:04:48,469 --> 00:04:52,063
You tell someone it's a phone
and they'll try and make a call.

79
00:04:53,788 --> 00:04:56,302
Dougal, who would think
this is a telephone?

80
00:04:56,388 --> 00:04:58,742
Even a dog knows this isn't a phone.

81
00:04:58,827 --> 00:05:01,216
Ted, we'll agree to differ,
all right?

82
00:05:01,307 --> 00:05:04,265
We won't!
Because you're very, very wrong.

83
00:05:04,347 --> 00:05:07,941
Look, did the picture not give
you a clue? Why is the dog so happy?

84
00:05:09,626 --> 00:05:13,221
Somebody has given him a rubber
telephone that makes a noise!

85
00:05:13,306 --> 00:05:15,261
No, no! He's laughing because

86
00:05:15,345 --> 00:05:18,257
someone's trying to make a call
on the telephone.

87
00:05:18,345 --> 00:05:21,178
Dogs don't have the same
sense of humour as us!

88
00:05:21,265 --> 00:05:25,223
They're not as advanced.
Buy something sensible, like this.

89
00:05:27,904 --> 00:05:29,656
Now...

90
00:05:29,744 --> 00:05:31,381
Put a coin in that.

91
00:05:31,463 --> 00:05:33,215
Wow.

92
00:05:37,343 --> 00:05:38,570
God, Ted.

93
00:05:40,342 --> 00:05:43,698
That is fantastic.
What is it, a sort of money box?

94
00:05:43,782 --> 00:05:45,818
Yes. With something like this,

95
00:05:45,902 --> 00:05:49,496
it would be so easy
to make it look cheap and tacky.

96
00:05:49,581 --> 00:05:52,379
But just look at her there.
Pure class.

97
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:56,770
Now, come on, now. The joke's over.

98
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,612
- Here we go.
- Oh, God.

99
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:03,010
- What's up with you, Ted?
- It's just the tension.

100
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,498
It'll be Ok in a minute.

101
00:06:04,579 --> 00:06:07,935
Wouldn't it be terrible
to be killed in a plane crash?

102
00:06:08,019 --> 00:06:10,294
- Yes.
- Or if you just fell out.

103
00:06:10,379 --> 00:06:13,370
If the floor just disappeared
and you fell out.

104
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:15,608
You'd fall for ages and ages...

105
00:06:28,496 --> 00:06:30,691
Feeling a bit better, Ted?

106
00:06:30,776 --> 00:06:33,051
No, Dougal, not really, no.

107
00:06:33,136 --> 00:06:36,014
Tell you what.
Maybe I'll give Larry Duff a call.

108
00:06:36,096 --> 00:06:39,007
He developed a fear of flying
after all his crashes.

109
00:06:39,095 --> 00:06:40,926
He went to a hypnotherapist.

110
00:06:41,015 --> 00:06:44,087
Told me to give him a call
any time I was nervous.

111
00:06:45,534 --> 00:06:47,809
Oh, for God's sake.

112
00:06:49,334 --> 00:06:51,802
- What was that?
- Just a bit of turbulence.

113
00:06:51,894 --> 00:06:54,123
God, I wish I wasn't so nervous.

114
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:57,762
Larry says you've more chance
of being trampled by donkeys

115
00:06:57,853 --> 00:07:00,208
than of being killed
in a plane crash.

116
00:07:01,692 --> 00:07:04,331
(Mobile phone )

117
00:07:09,691 --> 00:07:11,488
(Stampeding hooves )

118
00:07:12,811 --> 00:07:14,927
No, he's not picking up.

119
00:07:15,011 --> 00:07:16,808
(Gibbers like a monkey )

120
00:07:16,891 --> 00:07:18,687
Ted!

121
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:22,238
Hello. Father Fay, hello.

122
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:24,798
(Gibbering)

123
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:26,641
Ah, yes, it's very good.

124
00:07:26,729 --> 00:07:29,448
(Gibbering)

125
00:07:29,529 --> 00:07:31,599
I am a very big fan of his,
all right.

126
00:07:31,689 --> 00:07:33,441
Or should I say, "Awright?"

127
00:07:33,529 --> 00:07:36,440
(Gibbering)

128
00:07:36,528 --> 00:07:38,803
No, there's no mention of it so far.

129
00:07:39,888 --> 00:07:42,720
- (Grunting)
- God, Ted, he has me driven mad!

130
00:07:42,807 --> 00:07:46,197
He asked me to take him up
to see the cockpit.

131
00:07:46,287 --> 00:07:48,847
Cockpit? Ah, Ted,
can I have a look, too?

132
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:50,598
Well, Dougal, I'm not sure.

133
00:07:50,686 --> 00:07:52,483
What is he up to now?

134
00:07:55,846 --> 00:08:00,316
He's going mad with excitement,
I'd better go. Coming, Father?

135
00:08:00,405 --> 00:08:02,475
Dougal. Don't touch anything.

136
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:05,637
We don't want an action replay
of the Sealink incident.

137
00:08:05,725 --> 00:08:07,680
Fair enough, Ted.

138
00:08:08,724 --> 00:08:10,476
- Hello!
- There you are, Father.

139
00:08:10,564 --> 00:08:13,476
- You wanted the official tour.
- God, yes.

140
00:08:13,564 --> 00:08:15,793
He's talked about nothing else!

141
00:08:15,883 --> 00:08:18,795
Will you calm down,
you little monkey man?

142
00:08:18,883 --> 00:08:21,681
Basically,
these are the main controls.

143
00:08:21,763 --> 00:08:24,595
Over here we have
the gauges for the engines.

144
00:08:30,522 --> 00:08:33,957
- Father. Father!
- What? I wasn't gonna press it.

145
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:37,113
Sorry, I was only asking
if you'd ever been in a cockpit.

146
00:08:37,201 --> 00:08:39,999
No. But I was on the bridge
of a Sealink ferry once

147
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,310
and I was looking at the controls...

148
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,960
- (Coughing)
- ..and nothing happened at all.

149
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,311
Right. That's it!

150
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:50,957
(Man laughing)

151
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:52,950
Hey, come on, now. What's so funny?

152
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:55,155
Just come on, now. The joke's over.

153
00:08:55,239 --> 00:08:57,035
- Who are you?
- What do you mean?

154
00:08:57,118 --> 00:09:01,396
You blind? I'm the man
you've been pestering with paper.

155
00:09:01,478 --> 00:09:03,628
- I have not.
- Why are you laughing?

156
00:09:03,718 --> 00:09:05,673
What's the big laugh about?

157
00:09:05,757 --> 00:09:08,510
I'm listening to comedy on these.
It's Mr Bean.

158
00:09:08,597 --> 00:09:10,588
Oh, right.

159
00:09:10,677 --> 00:09:14,385
And yes, I am blind,
as a matter of fact.

160
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:19,273
Is it since birth or is it
a more recent thing, you know?

161
00:09:19,356 --> 00:09:21,187
Since birth.

162
00:09:21,276 --> 00:09:24,472
Right, but I suppose your
other senses make up for it.

163
00:09:24,555 --> 00:09:28,628
I hear that blind people's other
senses are more alert. So to speak.

164
00:09:28,715 --> 00:09:32,104
I suppose you can smell things
from ten miles away

165
00:09:32,194 --> 00:09:34,185
and hear things
before they happen.

166
00:09:34,274 --> 00:09:37,710
- No.
- No sixth sense of any kind?

167
00:09:37,794 --> 00:09:40,307
I suppose in your case
it'd be a fifth sense,

168
00:09:40,393 --> 00:09:42,543
seeing as
you've only got the four.

169
00:09:42,633 --> 00:09:45,989
Unless there's another one
missing I don't know about.

170
00:09:46,073 --> 00:09:48,188
How's your sense of touch?

171
00:09:49,592 --> 00:09:51,787
Could you go away now, please?

172
00:09:51,872 --> 00:09:53,942
Yes, I'll do just that.

173
00:10:01,391 --> 00:10:04,427
Will you not calm down?

174
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:08,947
Come on, now. We'll head back.
Say thank you to Mr Pilot.

175
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:11,224
- Ahhh!
- Oh, God.

176
00:10:11,309 --> 00:10:14,426
He must've seen his reflection.
He's not supposed to.

177
00:10:14,509 --> 00:10:17,626
- He doesn't know he's a priest.
- (Shouting)

178
00:10:17,709 --> 00:10:20,063
Stop it, Father. Settle down.

179
00:10:20,148 --> 00:10:22,616
Get him off me! I can't see!

180
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:25,017
(Pilot) Father McGuire,
press the emergency button!

181
00:10:25,108 --> 00:10:26,985
- What?
- The emergency button!

182
00:10:27,068 --> 00:10:30,423
- What does it look like?
- It's "emergency" written on it!

183
00:10:36,946 --> 00:10:39,141
Right!

184
00:10:39,226 --> 00:10:41,615
I'll just go to the old toilet.

185
00:10:43,466 --> 00:10:46,263
( # Muzak)

186
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:49,303
Is, erm... Is this the toilet?

187
00:10:49,385 --> 00:10:53,138
First-class toilet, sir.
Do you have a first-class ticket?

188
00:10:54,424 --> 00:10:55,379
No.

189
00:10:55,464 --> 00:10:57,978
Then you have to go across the way.

190
00:11:02,863 --> 00:11:05,058
(Father Fay gibbering)

191
00:11:10,462 --> 00:11:12,100
- Ted?
- What?

192
00:11:12,182 --> 00:11:15,015
- Can I have a quick word?
- Yes.

193
00:11:15,102 --> 00:11:18,377
Yes, hold on. Right.

194
00:11:18,461 --> 00:11:19,894
What's wrong, Dougal?

195
00:11:19,981 --> 00:11:21,699
Well, slight problem, Ted.

196
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:23,260
What?

197
00:11:23,341 --> 00:11:27,219
Well, apparently someone
pressed a button in the cockpit.

198
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:30,849
I think the person might have emptied
one of the fuel tanks.

199
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,737
There's not enough fuel
to make it to the airport.

200
00:11:33,819 --> 00:11:37,653
Right. So that would mean what?
An emergency landing?

201
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:40,776
- Yeah, an emergency landing.
- Right.

202
00:11:40,859 --> 00:11:43,372
But we don't actually
have enough fuel

203
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:46,495
to make it to a place
to make an emergency landing.

204
00:11:46,578 --> 00:11:48,614
And there's only two parachutes.

205
00:11:48,698 --> 00:11:51,052
No, wait a second.
Before you carry on,

206
00:11:51,137 --> 00:11:53,128
what's this film called again?

207
00:11:53,217 --> 00:11:55,651
No, no, no. It's not a film.

208
00:11:55,737 --> 00:11:57,489
- It's not a film?
- No.

209
00:11:57,577 --> 00:12:00,648
- So this is actually happening.
- Yes.

210
00:12:00,736 --> 00:12:03,773
- This is happening now, to us.
- It is, yeah.

211
00:12:05,856 --> 00:12:08,733
Dougal, here's a mad guess
just out of the blue,

212
00:12:08,815 --> 00:12:10,533
but did you press the button?

213
00:12:10,615 --> 00:12:12,492
Ah, now, Ted, come on!

214
00:12:14,455 --> 00:12:16,922
- Did you, Dougal?
- I did, yeah.

215
00:12:18,254 --> 00:12:21,007
- Hello, Ted. Heard the news?
- Yes, Noel.

216
00:12:21,094 --> 00:12:24,244
- What'll we do?
- Did you press the emergency button?

217
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:25,971
- No.
- Shouldn't we?

218
00:12:26,053 --> 00:12:29,011
Careful. There might be
a fine for improper use.

219
00:12:29,093 --> 00:12:31,049
This is definitely an emergency.

220
00:12:31,133 --> 00:12:33,248
Let's keep the other priests calm,

221
00:12:33,332 --> 00:12:36,244
not a word about this
when we get back inside.

222
00:12:37,332 --> 00:12:39,163
(Alarm horn )

223
00:12:39,252 --> 00:12:44,006
(Recording) 'Emergency!
Emergency! Emergency!'

224
00:12:44,091 --> 00:12:45,922
Nothing happened. What does it do?

225
00:12:46,011 --> 00:12:49,241
Never needed it before.
Father, who gets the parachutes?

226
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:51,480
God, that's a tough decision.

227
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:54,642
You're right. Maybe we should
just not tell anybody.

228
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:57,721
Throw them off the plane,
pretend they never existed.

229
00:12:57,809 --> 00:13:01,961
No, I don't think we should do that.
I have a better idea.

230
00:13:04,568 --> 00:13:07,321
Right. This is my idea.
What we should do is this...

231
00:13:07,408 --> 00:13:12,323
So, in no more than 200 words,
why you should get a parachute.

232
00:13:13,807 --> 00:13:16,765
So we should just write about
how great we are?

233
00:13:16,847 --> 00:13:18,644
Yes.

234
00:13:20,047 --> 00:13:23,482
I got my housekeeper pregnant
and forced her leave the country,

235
00:13:23,566 --> 00:13:25,522
should I mention that?

236
00:13:26,286 --> 00:13:28,038
No, I wouldn't.

237
00:13:28,126 --> 00:13:30,958
Are you taking marks off
for spelling mistakes?

238
00:13:32,445 --> 00:13:34,754
Only if we end up
in a tie-break situation.

239
00:13:36,205 --> 00:13:39,958
- Who'll own the copyright?
- What?

240
00:13:40,044 --> 00:13:43,923
Say if I was to survive
and wanted to write my autobiography,

241
00:13:44,004 --> 00:13:47,279
could I use extracts
or would you own the copyright?

242
00:13:47,363 --> 00:13:50,002
As far as I know,
you own the copyright.

243
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:52,677
But the chances of us surviving
are very low.

244
00:13:52,763 --> 00:13:54,115
Right.

245
00:13:55,922 --> 00:13:58,675
Should we not just have
a bit of an old pray?

246
00:13:58,762 --> 00:14:01,151
Maybe God will help us and...

247
00:14:07,521 --> 00:14:09,477
Anyway...

248
00:14:09,561 --> 00:14:12,233
Have you all got pens and paper
and everything?

249
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,834
Can I use my laptop computer?

250
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:19,629
I don't think you're allowed to.
They interfere with the radar.

251
00:14:19,719 --> 00:14:21,994
Yes, but we're going to crash anyway.

252
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,912
Right, I see what you mean.
Yes, use it.

253
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:27,994
Go on, Dougal.

254
00:14:35,277 --> 00:14:38,872
God, Ted, you're very calm
altogether. Have you gone mad?

255
00:14:38,957 --> 00:14:41,676
No, it's just
I've always hated flying.

256
00:14:41,757 --> 00:14:44,316
But now we're in
an emergency situation,

257
00:14:44,396 --> 00:14:48,150
all my fear has transformed
itself into affirmative action.

258
00:14:48,236 --> 00:14:49,988
- Do you know what I mean?
- I do.

259
00:14:50,076 --> 00:14:52,270
- Do you?
- No.

260
00:14:56,715 --> 00:14:59,548
All right, then. Pens down.

261
00:14:59,635 --> 00:15:03,832
Father O'Shea, you didn't stop
writing. You're disqualified.

262
00:15:03,914 --> 00:15:06,792
What? That's not fair,
I was only finishing.

263
00:15:06,874 --> 00:15:09,182
Father Cave, do you want to go first?

264
00:15:10,753 --> 00:15:15,144
I haven't written this down
because it comes from the heart.

265
00:15:15,233 --> 00:15:20,181
Father Gallagher, I've known you
and been your friend for many years.

266
00:15:20,272 --> 00:15:22,786
And now I think
it's important to say...

267
00:15:22,872 --> 00:15:26,910
I love you. I love you more than
anybody I've ever loved.

268
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:30,988
I don't want the parachute.
Give it to him!

269
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:33,026
(Sobbing)

270
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,663
Right. Well done, Father Cave.

271
00:15:41,749 --> 00:15:42,898
(Sighing)

272
00:15:42,989 --> 00:15:45,105
(Ted) Father Fay?

273
00:15:46,229 --> 00:15:49,141
(Clearing throat)

274
00:15:49,229 --> 00:15:51,184
(Gibbering)

275
00:15:56,268 --> 00:15:58,019
That's very good.

276
00:16:01,307 --> 00:16:04,060
Well, beat that. Joe.

277
00:16:05,787 --> 00:16:10,098
Well, uh, I think I should get
the parachute because I'm great.

278
00:16:10,186 --> 00:16:14,656
In fact, I think I should get both
of them in case one doesn't work.

279
00:16:18,145 --> 00:16:20,579
Ooh, not a popular one, Joe.

280
00:16:20,665 --> 00:16:22,780
Father Flynn, what did you write?

281
00:16:22,864 --> 00:16:24,820
I haven't written anything

282
00:16:24,904 --> 00:16:27,372
because I'm not very good
at that kind of thing.

283
00:16:27,464 --> 00:16:29,216
But I did a drawing.

284
00:16:32,023 --> 00:16:34,332
Right. Well, can we have a look?

285
00:16:41,262 --> 00:16:43,730
- What do you think?
- (Ted) Well, er...

286
00:16:43,822 --> 00:16:46,461
It's me, in the nip. With a dog.

287
00:16:49,261 --> 00:16:51,775
How does that help you
win a parachute?

288
00:16:52,861 --> 00:16:57,570
What do you mean parachute? I wasn't
listening at the start there.

289
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,730
Why would I want a parachute?

290
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,253
The plane's in trouble.

291
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:05,217
There's a competition
to see who gets a parachute.

292
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:08,289
Oh.

293
00:17:12,858 --> 00:17:15,167
Ok. Father Jack, you next.

294
00:17:17,098 --> 00:17:20,170
Father Jack? Where's Father Jack?

295
00:17:20,258 --> 00:17:23,090
The parachutes.
The parachutes have gone.

296
00:17:37,415 --> 00:17:41,488
Ah, Ted, I just remembered
that we're all going to die.

297
00:17:41,575 --> 00:17:44,248
Dougal, I just wanted to say...

298
00:17:44,335 --> 00:17:47,246
I know sometimes
I'm a little short with you,

299
00:17:47,334 --> 00:17:49,928
sometimes I'm not as patient
as I should be.

300
00:17:50,014 --> 00:17:52,574
But you know, in the end...

301
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:54,609
we're the best of friends.

302
00:17:54,693 --> 00:17:56,729
- What do you mean?
- Well...

303
00:17:58,093 --> 00:17:59,845
I'm just trying to say...

304
00:17:59,933 --> 00:18:02,844
I know sometimes I act like
you get on my nerves,

305
00:18:02,932 --> 00:18:05,162
but secretly
I think it's quite funny.

306
00:18:05,252 --> 00:18:07,846
What's funny?

307
00:18:07,932 --> 00:18:10,047
You know, the way you mix things up

308
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:12,691
and sometimes you don't get
what's going on.

309
00:18:13,571 --> 00:18:15,766
Who are you talking about again?

310
00:18:15,851 --> 00:18:18,081
- You.
- What about me?

311
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:21,640
(Sighing) I'm just trying
to say, Dougal...

312
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:24,686
- I like you.
- Thanks very much.

313
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,806
- Who are you saying that to?
- You! I just said it!

314
00:18:29,089 --> 00:18:31,319
Hey! We're on a plane!

315
00:18:32,969 --> 00:18:36,643
Father, do you know what
a section tubing stabiliser dart is?

316
00:18:36,728 --> 00:18:39,765
- No.
- A shell diversifier E-420?

317
00:18:39,848 --> 00:18:42,237
- No.
- A jet-wrench 3-ply shortstick?

318
00:18:42,328 --> 00:18:43,476
- No.
- Who am I?

319
00:18:43,567 --> 00:18:45,842
- You're the pilot.
- Great.

320
00:18:45,927 --> 00:18:48,316
I know what I did there.
I started too big.

321
00:18:48,407 --> 00:18:53,355
Father, do you know what
a fuel reserve is?

322
00:18:53,446 --> 00:18:56,756
I'd imagine it's a basic back-up
to the main fuel tanks.

323
00:18:56,846 --> 00:18:59,757
That's exactly it.
Now, we have a fuel reserve,

324
00:18:59,845 --> 00:19:03,235
but the line connecting it to the...

325
00:19:03,325 --> 00:19:05,919
- the thing on the wing...
- Engine.

326
00:19:06,005 --> 00:19:08,438
The engine, yes. That line is broken.

327
00:19:08,524 --> 00:19:11,675
If we could somehow fix that line,
we might stand a chance.

328
00:19:11,764 --> 00:19:15,359
Even sticky tape would do,
but there's none on the plane.

329
00:19:16,803 --> 00:19:18,794
That's where you're wrong.

330
00:19:18,883 --> 00:19:22,239
Dougal, give us the thing
you bought there.

331
00:19:22,323 --> 00:19:24,278
All your problems are over.

332
00:19:27,122 --> 00:19:30,751
I wouldn't make any calls,
it interferes with the radar.

333
00:19:30,842 --> 00:19:32,832
Dougal! The sticky tape.

334
00:19:36,921 --> 00:19:38,752
Brilliant.

335
00:19:38,841 --> 00:19:41,400
Now all you have to do
is climb onto the wheels,

336
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,311
and attach the line.

337
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,719
- Then we're saved?
- Yes.

338
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,473
I just climb out of the plane and...
Hang on.

339
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:50,119
- I climb out of the plane?
- Yes.

340
00:19:50,199 --> 00:19:53,908
I wouldn't trust anybody else.
You can keep a level head.

341
00:19:55,959 --> 00:19:57,835
- Then I'll do it.
- But Ted!

342
00:19:57,918 --> 00:19:59,795
Dougal, I love all this.

343
00:19:59,878 --> 00:20:03,109
When everything's Ok I imagine
terrible things happening

344
00:20:03,198 --> 00:20:06,985
and now that one has actually
happened, it's just a rush.

345
00:20:07,077 --> 00:20:10,433
I feel fearless,
like Jeff Bridges in that movie.

346
00:20:10,517 --> 00:20:13,952
- I haven't seen that one.
- Not many have, Dougal.

347
00:20:14,036 --> 00:20:18,188
Anyway, let's go, Captain.

348
00:20:18,276 --> 00:20:20,995
Father, I'm not a Captain.

349
00:20:21,076 --> 00:20:24,351
And I don't climb under planes
to fix fuel lines.

350
00:20:24,435 --> 00:20:27,427
I think from now on,
we're anything we want to be.

351
00:20:28,835 --> 00:20:30,870
Can I still be a priest?

352
00:20:40,473 --> 00:20:44,352
- You're a very brave man.
- I'm just doing a job.

353
00:20:44,433 --> 00:20:46,389
Dougal, the sticky tape.

354
00:20:46,473 --> 00:20:49,350
Well, I'd better get back
to the cockpit.

355
00:20:50,512 --> 00:20:52,468
Good luck, Father Ted.

356
00:20:58,311 --> 00:21:00,461
(Sticky tape unrolling)

357
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:04,748
'You have used three inches
of sticky tape. God bless you.'

358
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,309
(Tape unrolling)

359
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:10,303
'You have used four inches
of sticky tape. God bless you.

360
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:13,779
'You have used 11 and two-eighths
inches of sticky tape.

361
00:21:13,869 --> 00:21:14,984
'God bless you.'

362
00:21:15,069 --> 00:21:17,583
(Ted) Ah, shut up. Wait! Dougal...

363
00:21:17,669 --> 00:21:20,660
I think I've...
Yes! I've sealed up the line!

364
00:21:20,748 --> 00:21:23,262
- We're saved!
- Oh, great!

365
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:25,908
I've done it, Dougal!
We're going to live!

366
00:21:25,988 --> 00:21:28,421
Everything's completely
back to normal.

367
00:21:28,507 --> 00:21:33,262
It's just your completely average
common or garden aeroplane journey.

368
00:21:34,107 --> 00:21:35,301
(Ted screaming)

369
00:21:35,387 --> 00:21:37,775
What am I doing
on the fecking wheel? !

370
00:21:37,866 --> 00:21:40,334
(Screaming)

371
00:21:45,065 --> 00:21:47,454
Oh, right. Right.

372
00:21:47,545 --> 00:21:49,775
Thanks very much.

373
00:21:49,865 --> 00:21:52,220
Well, still no sign of Father Jack.

374
00:21:52,305 --> 00:21:54,056
Oh, I hope he's all right.

375
00:21:54,144 --> 00:21:57,898
And Father Crilly.
I hate seeing him like this.

376
00:21:57,984 --> 00:22:01,862
(Dougal) Ah, he's beginning
to loosen his grip now.

377
00:22:06,743 --> 00:22:08,893
Anyway, would you like a sandwich?

378
00:22:08,983 --> 00:22:11,894
I cut them into the shape
of an aeroplane.

379
00:22:13,142 --> 00:22:14,655
No thanks, Mrs Doyle.

380
00:22:14,742 --> 00:22:18,370
Ted and me have had enough of
aeroplanes to do us a lifetime.

381
00:22:18,461 --> 00:22:20,417
Haven't we, Ted?

382
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:25,976
(Jack) Drink! Feck! Arse!

383
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:29,814
Drink! Feck! Arse!

384
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:33,017
Drink! Feck! Arse! Drink!

385
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:36,171
Ahh! Drink! Drink!

386
00:22:36,259 --> 00:22:38,819
Arse! (Screaming)

387
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:41,288
Drink! Drink! Drink!

388
00:22:41,379 --> 00:22:43,130
Feck! Arse!

389
00:22:43,218 --> 00:22:45,368
(Sobbing)

390
00:22:47,378 --> 00:22:49,528
(Gibbering and sobbing)

391
00:22:50,618 --> 00:22:52,892
Drink! Drink! Drink!

392
00:22:52,977 --> 00:22:54,808
(Sobbing)

393
00:22:54,897 --> 00:22:56,171
(Gasping)

394
00:22:56,257 --> 00:22:58,896
Drink! Drink!

395
00:22:58,976 --> 00:23:01,410
(Continues shouting and sobbing)

396
00:23:07,815 --> 00:23:11,205
'This is your pilot speaking.
The emergency is over.

397
00:23:11,295 --> 00:23:13,570
'We will be landing in 20 minutes.'

398
00:23:14,305 --> 00:24:14,483
