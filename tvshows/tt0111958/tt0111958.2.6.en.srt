1
00:00:08,284 --> 00:00:10,639
Ted! Ted, quick! It's Father Ben!

2
00:00:12,525 --> 00:00:14,163
Oh, great. I love this.

3
00:00:19,646 --> 00:00:21,716
'God, Ben, I'm such an eejit.

4
00:00:21,806 --> 00:00:24,560
'I've put the shorts on me head!'

5
00:00:26,127 --> 00:00:29,245
'God Almighty, Brendan.
You're a big fool.'

6
00:00:29,328 --> 00:00:32,718
This is...this is
really top-notch stuff.

7
00:00:34,568 --> 00:00:36,525
That Brendan's an eejit.

8
00:00:38,529 --> 00:00:40,485
I know someone just like Ben.

9
00:00:40,569 --> 00:00:42,526
Big thicko!

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,074
OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN
from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn

11
00:01:05,654 --> 00:01:07,007
(Helicopter)

12
00:01:11,535 --> 00:01:12,888
(Crash)

13
00:01:17,536 --> 00:01:20,289
(Man ) Come on, you two. Nearly there.

14
00:01:20,376 --> 00:01:22,254
(Woman ) It's a bit creepy.

15
00:01:22,337 --> 00:01:25,090
(Man ) There's nothing
that could harm...

16
00:01:25,177 --> 00:01:26,815
(Twig snaps )

17
00:01:36,979 --> 00:01:38,890
Ah. There he is now, anyway.

18
00:01:38,979 --> 00:01:40,891
- He's great, isn't he?
- He is.

19
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:45,417
- Does he have a name?
- The pet shop didn't mention one.

20
00:01:46,421 --> 00:01:51,017
I dunno... How about "Ted"?
That's a good name for a rabbit.

21
00:01:51,101 --> 00:01:54,936
That's not a good idea.
You're forgetting I'm called Ted.

22
00:01:57,703 --> 00:01:59,659
I could call you Father Ted.

23
00:01:59,743 --> 00:02:04,135
No. You'll have to come up with
something a bit more original.

24
00:02:05,384 --> 00:02:08,296
- Hello, Fathers.
- (Both) Hello, Mrs Doyle.

25
00:02:10,785 --> 00:02:12,741
How about "Mrs Doyle"?

26
00:02:13,825 --> 00:02:16,294
Mrs Doyle is not
a good name for a rabbit.

27
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:18,695
Something like "Popsy" or "Bruce".

28
00:02:18,786 --> 00:02:21,175
Oh, right. Wait, I've got one.

29
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:24,464
You see the way he's got
big, floppy ears?

30
00:02:24,547 --> 00:02:25,502
Yeah.

31
00:02:25,587 --> 00:02:29,137
Why don't we call him
"Father Jack Hackett"?

32
00:02:30,188 --> 00:02:32,099
Perfect. Father Jack it is.

33
00:02:32,188 --> 00:02:35,818
- What?!
- Nothing. Dougal's named his rabbit.

34
00:02:35,909 --> 00:02:38,104
- What?!
- You all right, Father Jack?

35
00:02:38,189 --> 00:02:41,660
- What?!
- No. He's talking to the rabbit.

36
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:44,787
- What?!
- Father Jack wants a drink.

37
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:46,190
Drink! Drink!

38
00:02:46,271 --> 00:02:49,627
- Give him some water.
- Water! Feck!

39
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:53,068
Dougal, this is getting
far too confusing.

40
00:02:53,152 --> 00:02:57,783
I'm used to calling him Father Jack.
Call Father Jack something else.

41
00:02:57,873 --> 00:02:59,784
Great. What'll we call him?

42
00:02:59,873 --> 00:03:01,670
Flipper. Flipper the Priest.

43
00:03:01,753 --> 00:03:03,631
Yes?

44
00:03:03,714 --> 00:03:06,990
- Dougal, this is not going to work.
- (Phone )

45
00:03:10,675 --> 00:03:14,429
- 'Father Crilly speaking.'
- Crilly, it's Bishop Brennan.

46
00:03:14,515 --> 00:03:16,472
Oh, feck!

47
00:03:17,596 --> 00:03:18,551
What?

48
00:03:18,636 --> 00:03:22,346
(French accent) Who is this?
There is no Crilly 'ere.

49
00:03:25,357 --> 00:03:28,111
God, I just said "feck"
to Bishop Brennan.

50
00:03:28,198 --> 00:03:29,950
He won't like that.

51
00:03:30,038 --> 00:03:34,237
It's Ok, I put on an accent so he'll
think he had the wrong number.

52
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,071
(Phone )

53
00:03:37,679 --> 00:03:40,069
- 'Crilly.'
- Hello, Bishop Brennan.

54
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,958
I think
you got the wrong number there.

55
00:03:44,401 --> 00:03:46,119
Shut up, Crilly. Shut up.

56
00:03:46,201 --> 00:03:47,919
I'll make this quick.

57
00:03:48,001 --> 00:03:51,631
What would the following words
suggest to you?

58
00:03:51,722 --> 00:03:54,475
"Jack", "sleepwalking"

59
00:03:54,562 --> 00:03:56,474
and "bollock-naked"?

60
00:03:57,563 --> 00:03:59,042
Oh, no!

61
00:03:59,123 --> 00:04:02,241
This is the third time
in the last six months.

62
00:04:02,324 --> 00:04:04,758
You may have heard of Brian Noonan,

63
00:04:04,844 --> 00:04:08,554
a very important Junior Minister,
and a personal friend.

64
00:04:08,645 --> 00:04:12,035
And the last thing
he and his family needs to see

65
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:16,244
is the vision of an elderly priest
wearing only socks and a hat.

66
00:04:16,326 --> 00:04:20,286
I'll be round on Thursday
to examine security arrangements.

67
00:04:20,367 --> 00:04:22,039
- And Crilly?
- Yes?

68
00:04:22,127 --> 00:04:25,916
If you ever try
to bullshit me like that again,

69
00:04:26,008 --> 00:04:28,397
I will rip off your arms.

70
00:04:33,569 --> 00:04:36,527
Bishop Brennan's coming
to have a word, Father,

71
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:40,046
- about your nude sleepwalking.
- Nudie Father Jack!

72
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:43,042
Can you think why
you might be doing that?

73
00:04:46,531 --> 00:04:49,285
You're not having any doubts
about your vocation?

74
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:52,011
- What?!
- You can share problems with us.

75
00:04:52,092 --> 00:04:54,447
We'll always listen.
Right, Dougal?

76
00:04:54,532 --> 00:04:55,932
Absolutely.

77
00:04:56,013 --> 00:04:58,129
D'you want to talk about it now?

78
00:04:59,413 --> 00:05:01,132
Well, Ted - Byker Grove.

79
00:05:01,214 --> 00:05:03,170
God, yes. After Byker Grove.

80
00:05:09,735 --> 00:05:11,771
Go on, there. Go on, boy. Fetch!

81
00:05:11,855 --> 00:05:13,653
Go on. Go on.

82
00:05:13,736 --> 00:05:16,728
Come on,
don't let Bishop Brennan see him.

83
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:20,492
- He might like him.
- No, he doesn't like rabbits.

84
00:05:20,577 --> 00:05:22,772
- Why not?
- It's a strange story.

85
00:05:22,857 --> 00:05:26,328
Ten years ago he got trapped
in a lift with 20 rabbits.

86
00:05:26,418 --> 00:05:28,773
They started nibbling his cape.

87
00:05:28,858 --> 00:05:30,530
How did they get in?

88
00:05:30,619 --> 00:05:33,531
They must've burrowed in.
You know rabbits.

89
00:05:34,619 --> 00:05:38,010
- God, he can move fast enough.
- Why d'you say that?

90
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,409
He just shot across the floor.

91
00:05:43,501 --> 00:05:45,253
Wait...

92
00:05:45,341 --> 00:05:47,377
That's your rabbit.

93
00:05:47,461 --> 00:05:49,692
- Yeah.
- Where did this one come from?

94
00:05:50,822 --> 00:05:53,177
There's another one on Jack's head.

95
00:05:55,983 --> 00:05:59,020
Make sure your rabbit
doesn't get mixed up with these.

96
00:05:59,103 --> 00:06:02,494
- Come on, Sampras.
- What did you call him?

97
00:06:02,584 --> 00:06:04,859
Sampras. Like Pete Sampras.

98
00:06:04,944 --> 00:06:06,298
Why?

99
00:06:06,385 --> 00:06:09,934
You know - rabbits, tennis -
that whole connection.

100
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:16,017
Oh, right. We'll just release
these spare ones into the wild, Ok?

101
00:06:16,106 --> 00:06:19,497
Look at him without
any other rabbits for company.

102
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:23,979
He must feel like Brian k eenan
after they took John McCarthy away.

103
00:06:24,068 --> 00:06:26,059
Anyway, he'll get used to it.

104
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,548
Morning, Father.

105
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:43,347
Bills, bills, more bills.

106
00:06:47,231 --> 00:06:49,427
- Morning, Ted.
- Morning, Dougal.

107
00:06:49,512 --> 00:06:51,070
What'll we do today?

108
00:06:51,152 --> 00:06:54,190
Hide your rabbit
before Bishop Brennan comes.

109
00:06:54,273 --> 00:06:57,071
He'd go mad
if he thought there's rabbit around.

110
00:06:57,153 --> 00:06:59,987
- Fair enough.
- I hope he's in a good mood.

111
00:07:00,074 --> 00:07:02,224
Len can be very scary when...

112
00:07:02,314 --> 00:07:03,747
When...

113
00:07:03,834 --> 00:07:05,427
(Screams )

114
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:10,308
- What's wrong, Ted?
- Rabbits!

115
00:07:10,395 --> 00:07:12,307
Rabbits? Where? Oh, wow!

116
00:07:12,956 --> 00:07:15,754
(Ted) Where did these ones
come from?

117
00:07:15,836 --> 00:07:18,590
God, it's like a big
rabbit rock festival.

118
00:07:19,437 --> 00:07:22,190
I suppose we'll just
have to get used to it.

119
00:07:22,277 --> 00:07:25,395
"Get used to it?"
We have to get them out of here!

120
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:29,074
- I'll ring the shop.
- No, it was a travelling pet shop.

121
00:07:29,159 --> 00:07:31,548
They won't be back till spring.

122
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:34,757
God! What are we gonna do?

123
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:37,673
There is actually
something we can do, Ted.

124
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,433
If we... Let me see now.
Just wait a second.

125
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,796
- I know. I've got it.
- What?

126
00:07:42,881 --> 00:07:45,520
Now, the way I see it is if we...

127
00:07:45,601 --> 00:07:48,514
Wait a second.
What's the problem again?

128
00:07:48,602 --> 00:07:52,197
- The rabbits!
- Rabbits, yes. Sorry about that.

129
00:07:52,282 --> 00:07:55,992
I know exactly what to do.
Give them to Father Larry Duff.

130
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:57,402
Right!

131
00:07:57,483 --> 00:08:01,033
He's always going on about how
he'd love to have a few rabbits!

132
00:08:01,124 --> 00:08:03,877
I used to think it was just
a mad thing to say.

133
00:08:05,525 --> 00:08:07,436
(Ringing)

134
00:08:07,525 --> 00:08:10,962
- 'Hello, Larry?'
- Hello, Ted. How's it hangin'?

135
00:08:11,046 --> 00:08:13,844
It's hanging fine.
I've a bit of a problem.

136
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:16,839
Remember you were looking
for a few rabbits?

137
00:08:16,927 --> 00:08:20,317
I do, Ted. That's one
of my all-time fantasies.

138
00:08:20,407 --> 00:08:24,321
I'd love to have a few hundred
rabbits running all over the place.

139
00:08:24,408 --> 00:08:27,923
Well, today's your lucky day.
We've got loads of the things!

140
00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:30,648
Sorry, Ted.
I won't be able to take them.

141
00:08:30,729 --> 00:08:34,518
- Why not, Larry?
- I gave up on the rabbits idea.

142
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:39,479
It just seemed too far-fetched.
So I got 12 Rottweilers instead.

143
00:08:40,971 --> 00:08:42,882
I'd love to take the rabbits

144
00:08:42,971 --> 00:08:46,408
only I'd be afraid
the Rottweilers might upset them.

145
00:08:46,492 --> 00:08:50,724
- Yes, Larry. I understand. Bye.
- Ah, bye, Ted.

146
00:08:51,813 --> 00:08:56,125
Oh, you're a bad dog.
Don't you look at me like that.

147
00:08:56,213 --> 00:08:59,604
- (Growling and snarling)
- You're a very bad dog.

148
00:08:59,694 --> 00:09:02,572
(Snarling and barking)

149
00:09:02,654 --> 00:09:06,045
He can't take the rabbits.
He's got 12 Rottweilers.

150
00:09:06,135 --> 00:09:09,286
- Hey! Hey! Hey, you!
- Yes, Father?

151
00:09:09,376 --> 00:09:11,287
(Stuttering)

152
00:09:12,376 --> 00:09:13,604
Rats!

153
00:09:14,856 --> 00:09:17,132
Yes, Father, we can see them as well.

154
00:09:17,217 --> 00:09:20,573
Hairy Japanese bastards!

155
00:09:24,498 --> 00:09:29,732
D'you know what this is like?
A plague, a big rabbit plague.

156
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:31,775
I wonder if God is punishing us.

157
00:09:31,859 --> 00:09:34,420
Maybe because I said "feck"
to Bishop Brennan.

158
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,412
If he'd send a plague
of rabbits for that,

159
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:41,460
what'll he do about that money
you stole from that charity?

160
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:46,570
Dougal, that money was just resting
in my account before I moved it on!

161
00:09:46,662 --> 00:09:49,017
- Ted...
- It was a non-profit making...

162
00:09:49,102 --> 00:09:51,378
Ted! The bunnies are gone!

163
00:09:51,463 --> 00:09:55,422
- Where did they go?
- I think they followed Father Jack.

164
00:09:55,503 --> 00:09:56,778
Amazing.

165
00:09:56,864 --> 00:10:00,220
I always thought Father Jack
gave off a furry smell.

166
00:10:00,304 --> 00:10:02,865
Maybe they think he's a rabbit god.

167
00:10:02,945 --> 00:10:05,095
So if we keep Jack out of the way...

168
00:10:05,185 --> 00:10:07,858
But Bishop Brennan's
coming to see Jack.

169
00:10:07,945 --> 00:10:09,902
We'll have to get rid of them.

170
00:10:09,986 --> 00:10:13,137
You know Paddy Jordan,
works at the greyhound track?

171
00:10:13,226 --> 00:10:16,424
- Oh, yes.
- Get me his number. I've an idea.

172
00:10:17,387 --> 00:10:19,537
(Buzzer)

173
00:10:31,829 --> 00:10:32,785
(Banging)

174
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:36,579
Come on! Get out of it! Shoo! Shoo!

175
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,229
Call me old-fashioned,

176
00:10:38,311 --> 00:10:41,940
but I prefer the
greyhounds-pursuing-rabbits approach.

177
00:10:42,031 --> 00:10:45,183
It was just a thought.
I'll go and give Tom a call.

178
00:10:45,272 --> 00:10:47,991
- He might be able to help.
- Coming, Father?

179
00:10:48,072 --> 00:10:50,826
No. I've £10
riding on that little beauty.

180
00:10:50,913 --> 00:10:54,303
Come on, Eamonn! Come on, Eamonn!
Come on, Eamonn!

181
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,189
(Buzzer)

182
00:10:59,274 --> 00:11:03,029
- 'Who's that? Go away!'
- Ah, Tom, it's just us.

183
00:11:03,115 --> 00:11:05,185
'Right, Father. Come on down.'

184
00:11:05,275 --> 00:11:08,666
Tom knows about this type of thing.
He'll help us.

185
00:11:12,436 --> 00:11:14,507
- Hello, Fathers.
- Hello, Tom.

186
00:11:14,597 --> 00:11:19,148
- Something to eat? A salad?
- No, thanks. Some other time.

187
00:11:19,237 --> 00:11:20,956
You've a few rabbits for me?

188
00:11:21,038 --> 00:11:23,506
- Yes, in the car.
- With you in a moment.

189
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:27,590
What's Tom going to do again?

190
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:30,591
He just said he'd
take care of them.

191
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:34,070
Probably collect them together
somewhere safe.

192
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,631
- So he'll just look after them?
- (Clattering)

193
00:11:37,721 --> 00:11:41,077
I think he'll put them in a pen
where they can play.

194
00:11:41,161 --> 00:11:43,722
(Chainsaw roaring)

195
00:11:49,443 --> 00:11:52,355
..so there'll be
nothing to worry about.

196
00:11:52,443 --> 00:11:54,798
(Dougal) That puts my mind to rest.

197
00:11:55,804 --> 00:11:58,796
- There he is.
- Right, Father. Let's get to it.

198
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:02,844
That's an impressive sword.
Where will you put the rabbits?

199
00:12:02,925 --> 00:12:06,839
- In the vice, Father.
- In the vice?

200
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:09,838
I've been practising
with this toy one.

201
00:12:09,926 --> 00:12:11,837
First you stun it, right?

202
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:14,838
Then you put it in the vice.

203
00:12:17,047 --> 00:12:18,959
Grab his legs there, Father.

204
00:12:19,048 --> 00:12:23,758
Er, Tom, you know the phrase
"to take care of something"?

205
00:12:23,848 --> 00:12:25,168
Yes, Father.

206
00:12:25,249 --> 00:12:28,958
I realise now that you meant that
in a sort of Al Pacino way

207
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:32,759
whereas I was thinking more
along the lines of Julie Andrews.

208
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:34,886
They won't feel a thing.

209
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:36,882
- No.
- You can have a go if you want.

210
00:12:36,971 --> 00:12:39,041
No, no, Tom. It's a bit cruel.

211
00:12:39,971 --> 00:12:41,927
I could run 'em down in me van.

212
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:45,766
- Dougal, we'd better be off.
- What's the problem, Ted?

213
00:12:45,852 --> 00:12:47,888
Have you nothing I can kill?

214
00:12:47,972 --> 00:12:49,884
Sorry about that, Tom.

215
00:12:49,973 --> 00:12:52,248
Ah, feck it! Feck it anyway!

216
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:54,564
(Ted) Run, Dougal. Run quite fast!

217
00:13:02,975 --> 00:13:05,409
(Ted) I'm sure
it won't happen again.

218
00:13:05,495 --> 00:13:07,407
(Brennan ) It better not.

219
00:13:07,496 --> 00:13:11,694
Priests walking about in the nude
is the last thing that we need.

220
00:13:11,776 --> 00:13:13,847
(Giggles ) Yes.

221
00:13:13,937 --> 00:13:18,648
And as you can see, we've installed
a new closed-circuit camera.

222
00:13:18,738 --> 00:13:21,650
And added a few modifications
to Jack's bed.

223
00:13:24,819 --> 00:13:27,936
Ah, yes. Yes.
Now, this is new, isn't it?

224
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:31,774
Combined with the spikes,
escape is almost impossible.

225
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:35,490
And new pyjamas - very easy
to put on, very hard to get off

226
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:37,572
so that's the nudity sorted.

227
00:13:37,661 --> 00:13:39,572
And, eh, you have the...

228
00:13:39,661 --> 00:13:42,301
Ah, yes. The rope. (Chuckles )

229
00:13:42,382 --> 00:13:45,340
I'd like to see him
chew through that.

230
00:13:45,422 --> 00:13:46,855
Again.

231
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:53,976
In the event of him getting out,
we have this tracking device.

232
00:13:54,064 --> 00:13:58,376
That cost £50. Could we
get that back from the diocese?

233
00:13:58,464 --> 00:14:00,023
Just joking!

234
00:14:00,105 --> 00:14:03,336
- Ah, hello, Len.
- Don't call me Len. I'm a bishop.

235
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:07,055
- "Your Grace" is more appropriate.
- Oh, right. Hello.

236
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:12,141
Anyway... Yet again, I am dragged
away from my warm fireside

237
00:14:12,227 --> 00:14:15,537
to come and deal with
the cast of Police Academy.

238
00:14:17,108 --> 00:14:20,578
You behave yourself now, Jack.
You listening, Jack?

239
00:14:20,668 --> 00:14:22,545
No!

240
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:25,268
- Drink, your Grace?
- A small one, please.

241
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:31,349
I'll just...
Would you like ice with it?

242
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:33,386
A drop of soda?

243
00:14:34,711 --> 00:14:37,100
I'll just get the glasses.

244
00:14:37,191 --> 00:14:39,147
- (Jack) Feck off!
- (Punch)

245
00:14:40,952 --> 00:14:44,661
- A cup of tea, your Grace?
- Time for dinny-poos!

246
00:14:44,752 --> 00:14:47,665
Thanks very much, Mrs Doyle.
That'll be grand.

247
00:14:50,913 --> 00:14:52,266
Mm!

248
00:14:52,354 --> 00:14:54,743
Oh, there you are, Bishop Brennan.

249
00:14:54,834 --> 00:14:58,953
I thought I should tell you,
your car is parked outside.

250
00:14:59,035 --> 00:15:01,026
I know it is. I parked it myself.

251
00:15:01,115 --> 00:15:05,109
The tyres look a bit flat.
I could blow them up with the pump.

252
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:08,108
- No!
- What kind of air do you put in?

253
00:15:08,196 --> 00:15:11,109
We've got ordinary or...
That's all we have.

254
00:15:11,197 --> 00:15:14,712
If you're looking for the wipers,
they're in the kitchen.

255
00:15:14,797 --> 00:15:16,117
What?

256
00:15:16,198 --> 00:15:19,793
They looked like they needed a wash.
Only trouble is,

257
00:15:19,878 --> 00:15:23,349
I broke the side window
while I was snapping them off.

258
00:15:23,439 --> 00:15:26,795
Leave my car alone
and don't touch it again.

259
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:28,950
Just one question, your Grace.

260
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,828
- Is your car diesel or petrol?
- Leave it alone, Mrs Doyle.

261
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:36,038
No, no, no.
This is just curiosity, your Grace.

262
00:15:36,121 --> 00:15:38,510
- Diesel or...?
- Diesel! It's diesel!

263
00:15:38,601 --> 00:15:41,560
- So it's not petrol.
- No, it's not petrol.

264
00:15:41,642 --> 00:15:44,361
It'd do terrible damage
if I put petrol in?

265
00:15:44,442 --> 00:15:47,719
Yes. It would completely
ruin the car's engine.

266
00:15:47,803 --> 00:15:52,082
Well... (Laughs hysterically)
I certainly won't do that, then!

267
00:15:57,485 --> 00:16:02,036
You must clock up a fair old
mileage, going round the diocese,

268
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:04,196
doing the old bishop sort of...

269
00:16:04,286 --> 00:16:07,676
Crilly, Crilly, where is my room?

270
00:16:07,766 --> 00:16:11,157
Well, er, yours
is the spare room, your Grace.

271
00:16:11,247 --> 00:16:13,203
It's the first on the right.

272
00:16:14,247 --> 00:16:17,877
Er... This lettuce...

273
00:16:18,968 --> 00:16:22,325
No, thanks.
I've already had some. You take it.

274
00:16:22,409 --> 00:16:26,607
No, Crilly. Crilly, I mean this
lettuce - where did it come from?

275
00:16:26,729 --> 00:16:28,721
You don't have rabbits, do you?

276
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:30,448
No! God, no!

277
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:34,319
I don't like them at all.
I had an experience once with some.

278
00:16:34,411 --> 00:16:38,165
They got into a lift with me
and started to nibble my cape...

279
00:16:38,251 --> 00:16:41,164
You've absolutely nothing
to worry about, your Grace.

280
00:16:41,252 --> 00:16:43,288
That's just where we, um...

281
00:16:43,372 --> 00:16:45,364
where we grow...the lettuce.

282
00:16:47,933 --> 00:16:49,844
You-you grow lettuce...

283
00:16:49,933 --> 00:16:51,845
indoors...in a cage?

284
00:16:51,934 --> 00:16:53,845
Yes, it's safer, you know.

285
00:16:53,934 --> 00:16:56,448
No one can steal it and, uh...

286
00:16:56,535 --> 00:16:59,447
Well, you know,
it brightens up the room.

287
00:16:59,535 --> 00:17:01,093
Uh-huh. Hmm.

288
00:17:02,135 --> 00:17:04,570
Er... Crilly, what is this?

289
00:17:07,576 --> 00:17:09,886
That's, um...

290
00:17:09,977 --> 00:17:11,729
caviar.

291
00:17:14,338 --> 00:17:15,691
Caviar?

292
00:17:15,778 --> 00:17:18,372
It's not every day
we have a bishop round

293
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:20,893
so we thought
we'd get the caviar out.

294
00:17:20,979 --> 00:17:23,891
Right, so you've
spread caviar down there

295
00:17:23,979 --> 00:17:27,131
so I can get down on my knees
and eat off the floor?!

296
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:29,609
Yes.

297
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:33,580
What d'you think I am, a pony?
I'm going to my bed.

298
00:17:38,142 --> 00:17:40,337
- Where are they?
- The bunnies?

299
00:17:40,422 --> 00:17:42,856
Ah-ha. Somewhere really safe, Ted.

300
00:17:43,943 --> 00:17:45,501
God...

301
00:17:46,143 --> 00:17:48,293
- Where would that be?
- Guess.

302
00:17:48,383 --> 00:17:52,059
It's almost the type of place
you wouldn't even think of.

303
00:17:54,344 --> 00:17:56,063
God, I...I dunno.

304
00:17:56,145 --> 00:17:59,057
That small room behind the kitchen?

305
00:17:59,145 --> 00:18:01,454
The coal cellar?

306
00:18:01,545 --> 00:18:04,014
- I've got it. The shed!
- No, it's not the shed.

307
00:18:04,106 --> 00:18:08,180
Come on, where's the last place
you'd think I'd put them?

308
00:18:10,387 --> 00:18:14,017
The last place I'd think
you'd put them would be...

309
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:17,384
W-would actually be...

310
00:18:18,748 --> 00:18:21,058
- Bishop Brennan's room.
- Bingo!

311
00:18:22,149 --> 00:18:26,268
Think about it, it's the last place
he'd expect to find them!

312
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:28,341
His room! He'd never look there!

313
00:18:33,311 --> 00:18:34,903
Your Grace!

314
00:18:35,151 --> 00:18:36,106
Your Grace!

315
00:18:36,951 --> 00:18:37,350
- Your Grace, Your Grace...!
- What is it now?!

316
00:18:39,872 --> 00:18:43,832
I just wanted to say, the whole
bishop thing, fair play to ya!

317
00:18:43,913 --> 00:18:46,825
You probably get a lot of this,
but well done.

318
00:18:46,913 --> 00:18:50,270
Who'd have thought somebody from
Limerick would get this far?

319
00:18:50,354 --> 00:18:53,391
The other priests from the seminary
must feel pretty sick.

320
00:18:53,474 --> 00:18:56,512
They must be looking
at the TV and going,

321
00:18:56,595 --> 00:18:59,587
"How did that awful eejit
get to be a bishop?!"

322
00:18:59,675 --> 00:19:03,874
Not me, I always felt you have
a sort of a bishopy air about you.

323
00:19:03,956 --> 00:19:07,666
I'd just like to say -
can I shake your hand? - well done!

324
00:19:08,717 --> 00:19:10,628
Crilly, come here.

325
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:13,276
I hate you.

326
00:19:14,358 --> 00:19:18,192
So all that means
absolutely nothing to me.

327
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:22,155
Oh, I'm falling down the stairs!

328
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:23,991
(Yells)

329
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,868
Crilly, what happened?!

330
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,521
(Ted) I just
fell down the stairs there.

331
00:19:31,601 --> 00:19:33,080
Are you injured?

332
00:19:33,161 --> 00:19:37,235
I don't know...
My arm... I can't move...

333
00:19:37,322 --> 00:19:40,155
Do you want somebody
to call an ambulance?

334
00:19:40,242 --> 00:19:42,598
No, I'll just lie here for a while.

335
00:19:42,683 --> 00:19:45,880
Rest is probably
the best thing for me, now.

336
00:19:45,963 --> 00:19:48,558
Did you see that documentary
about Hiroshima?

337
00:19:48,644 --> 00:19:51,681
Who'd think an atomic bomb
could do so much damage?

338
00:19:51,764 --> 00:19:53,720
I'm going to bed!

339
00:19:57,565 --> 00:20:00,717
I'm all right, Bishop.
I'm fine now, thanks. Phew!

340
00:20:00,806 --> 00:20:04,401
(Dougal)
Ted, did Len find the rabbits?

341
00:20:06,127 --> 00:20:07,958
What did he say?

342
00:20:08,047 --> 00:20:09,799
I better tell you...

343
00:20:09,887 --> 00:20:12,004
Did he call me Len again?!

344
00:20:14,288 --> 00:20:17,918
You address me by my proper title,
you little bollocks!

345
00:20:20,129 --> 00:20:22,563
(Dougal) Sorry, Bishop Len Brennan.

346
00:20:22,649 --> 00:20:25,005
- What is he on about now?
- God knows.

347
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:27,524
What are ye on about, you big eejit?

348
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:30,603
- Did he find the rabbits?
- Shut up, Dougal!

349
00:20:30,691 --> 00:20:32,568
Your Grace, your Grace...!

350
00:20:33,771 --> 00:20:36,161
May I go in first?

351
00:20:36,252 --> 00:20:39,403
- Why?
- All the other toilets are broken.

352
00:20:40,332 --> 00:20:43,928
- Oh, it's just number ones.
- I don't want to know!

353
00:20:51,054 --> 00:20:53,010
Oh, I needed that.

354
00:21:00,376 --> 00:21:02,606
But there's no toilet in here!

355
00:21:06,297 --> 00:21:08,367
Dougal, they're not in there!

356
00:21:08,457 --> 00:21:12,087
- Are they not?
- No, that is a rabbit-free area.

357
00:21:12,178 --> 00:21:14,214
I definitely put them in there.

358
00:21:14,298 --> 00:21:18,212
Jack's room. Maybe they smelled him
and had to see him one last time.

359
00:21:18,299 --> 00:21:22,691
You might be putting that in
an over-romantic way, but come on!

360
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:28,695
God, Dougal, you're right.
But how did they get in?

361
00:21:28,781 --> 00:21:31,739
They must have burrowed in.
You know rabbits.

362
00:21:31,821 --> 00:21:35,212
We've got to get them out
and as far away as possible!

363
00:21:35,302 --> 00:21:37,179
Why not leave them here?

364
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:39,776
I can't relax
till the only rabbit left

365
00:21:39,862 --> 00:21:42,935
is the one sitting in your head
working the controls!

366
00:21:46,023 --> 00:21:48,663
God, Ted, there's loads more in here.

367
00:21:48,744 --> 00:21:53,296
Look at this one! Doesn't he look
like that fella, Harvey k eitel?

368
00:21:53,385 --> 00:21:56,457
God, Dougal,
how could a rabbit look like...

369
00:21:56,545 --> 00:21:59,458
God Almighty!
It's the spitting image of him!

370
00:22:01,746 --> 00:22:05,137
(Ted) Anyway, we haven't time
for things like that.

371
00:22:05,227 --> 00:22:08,936
(Dougal) Go on, lads, go on.
In, in...

372
00:22:09,027 --> 00:22:11,826
(Jack breathing heavily)

373
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:24,781
Ted, the bunnies are gone.

374
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:29,221
Oh, God! Where's Jack?!

375
00:22:31,951 --> 00:22:36,503
Oh, my God! Not the Bishop's room!
Come on, Dougal!

376
00:22:37,792 --> 00:22:41,911
- (Dougal, get as many as you can.)
- (All right. Come on, lads.)

377
00:22:41,993 --> 00:22:44,871
- (Ted) Mind that one.
- (Brennan muttering)

378
00:23:04,797 --> 00:23:07,755
Just a bad dream, your Grace.
Over in a mo.

379
00:23:07,837 --> 00:23:09,317
Oh, right.

380
00:23:11,998 --> 00:23:15,594
(Screaming)

381
00:23:16,305 --> 00:24:16,404
