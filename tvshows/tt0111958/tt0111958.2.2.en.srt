It's a big waste.

7
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,836
No, thanks, Ted.

8
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,269
Anyway, I've got these crisps here.

9
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:06,672
I get a cheese and onion one
and a salt and vinegar one

10
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,740
and I eat them in the same go.

11
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,640
That leak is getting worse, Dougal.

12
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,720
We'll have to move himself
and put that bucket under it.

13
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,716
Right. Fair enough, Ted.

14
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,034
I'm a happy camper!

15
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,794
God, that'll cost a fortune to fix.

16
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,200
Where will we get the money?
How can we raise some money?

17
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,514
Hmm…

18
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,477
Yes, I know! A-ha!

19
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,073
A-ha…

20
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,520
–Are you thinking what I am?
–I think so.

21
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,788
Yes!

22
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,560
But now, wait, I'm not sure.

23
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,079
What?

24
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:48,856
I mean, it is a big step
and where will we get the guns?

25
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,342
What are you talking about?

26
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,880
Actually, I might've been thinking
something different.

27
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:00,000
You thought we were going to
rob a bank, didn't you?

28
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,234
I did.

29
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,894
Dougal, this isn't
a Bruce Willis film.

30
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,520
I was thinking
more along the lines of a raffle.

31
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,400
–What'll we have as a prize, though?
–You got me there, Ted.

32
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:15,192
Under diocese rules, we're allowed a
raffle prize every couple of years.

33
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,593
It's stopped, Ted.

34
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,400
We have to move him.
Where's the thing for waking him up?

35
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,078
There it is.

36
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,990
(Ted) Father…
Father, it's only us.

37
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,752
GET TO FECk!

38
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,400
–Come on, Father…
–Drink!

39
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,710
Don't drink that, Father, no! It's…

40
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,995
Feckin' water!

41
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:51,589
and the island hasn't been
given anything to raffle

42
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,911
since those two bags of coal in 1964.

43
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,834
I-I think we're entitled,
under the rules of the diocese…

44
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,154
Oh, that'd be great!
That's wonderful!

45
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,160
Thank you very much, Your Grace!
Thanks again.

46
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,839
All right.
Bye, Bishop Brennan. Bye.

47
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,596
No luck, then?

48
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,996
Lots of luck, Dougal.
We're being given a car.

49
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,920
A car! That's a brilliant prize!

50
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:23,062
It's not that unusual.
Father Finnegan got one.

51
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,999
You know him, the Dancing Priest—
dances for peace.

52
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,196
Oh, yeah. Is he still going?

53
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,280
Yes, indeed.
He danced across America last year.

54
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,072
New York to Los Angeles.

55
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,480
He was mugged
about once every 15 miles.

56
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:41,799
Great! We'll have the roof sorted in
no time. Did you hear that, Father?

57
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,040
(Mrs Doyle ) Cup of tea, Fathers?

58
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,718
No, thanks, Mrs Doyle.

59
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,450
What do you think of her?

60
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,520
Nice. Are you sure
you won't have a cup?

61
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,240
–It's our raffle prize.
–Right. Just a drop in your hand?

62
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,160
Go inside. I'll take the tray.

63
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:06,080
All right. I'll put the kettle on
in case you want some more.

64
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,237
Oh, God, Ted!
There's a dent in the car!

65
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,799
What⁈

66
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,399
–Where's the dent?
–Just there, Ted.

67
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,000
God, how did that happen?

68
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,120
When you hit that fella on the bike.

69
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,914
Don't mention that to anyone.
Anyway, I saw him get up.

70
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,118
It's not too bad. I can
straighten it out with a hammer.

71
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,784
Have a look in that box.

72
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:38,518
Oops, I didn't mean to do that.
I'll just tap it the other way.

73
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,996
It's no use. You'll never
get it absolutely right.

74
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:01,708
(Sighing) I thought I had it
there a while ago, you know.

75
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,560
She was looking all right. But like
an eejit I kept banging away.

76
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,752
You're a perfectionist,
Ted, you know? It's not too bad.

77
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,478
Let's have another look.

78
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,630
(Ted) No… no, we can't
give that away as a prize.

79
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,160
Why not sleep on it?
See how you feel in the morning?

80
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,156
Maybe you're right.

81
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:31,709
(Ted) AH, JESUS, WE'RE DEAD!
OH, GOD ALMIGHTY!

82
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,740
Calm down there, Ted! Come on!

83
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,998
Calm down? We've just destroyed
a car that's worth seven grand!

84
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,800
Come on, Ted.
It'll look better in the morning.

85
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,440
Dougal, we're dead.
The Bishop will kill us!

86
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,790
We're dead! We're dead! We're dead!

87
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,070
Thanks, Dougal.
I probably needed that.

88
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,628
But don't ever do it again.

89
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,438
Now, what are we gonna do?

90
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,000
–We could run away.
–No, they'd find us.

91
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,156
–They always do.
–Oh, right.

92
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,800
What about that other fella?
The Dancing Priest.

93
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,549
Finnegan! Yes!
It'd be the same type of car!

94
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,996
How could we get him
to give it to us?

95
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,755
Maybe… Maybe we could
just get a lend of it.

96
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,116
But the raffle winner
won't want to give it back.

97
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:27,993
Now, Dougal, this is
going to sound very, very immoral,

98
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,719
but stay with me.

99
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,828
What if… What if we organised
the raffle so that we won it?

100
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,098
Then we could bring the car back.

101
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,078
Oooooohhhhh!

102
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,384
Oooh, that'd be terribly wrong.
I don't think we should do that.

103
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,280
It wouldn't be cheating, really.

104
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,880
It would just be a case
of structuring the raffle

105
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:53,800
so the return reaches the benefactors
rather than the beneficiaries.

106
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,114
Hmm.

107
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,077
Dougal, seriously. Listen.

108
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:00,840
If Bishop Brennan finds out
we wrecked the car, he WILL kill us.

109
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,714
And murder is a terrible,
terrible sin, Dougal.

110
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:10,591
So, by committing this little sin,
we'll be saving a Bishop's soul!

111
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,352
Fair enough, then, Ted.

about borrowing the car.

00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:27,197
God, I almost drifted off
for a moment there. Nearly home.

157
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:33,886
(Ted) Right, the raffle.
Let's go through it again.

158
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:38,240
I'll fill the hat with tickets all
with the same number on them— 11.

159
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,880
11. Two ones.
That's easy to remember, Ted.

160
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:44,799
And we'll make sure
that you have that number.

161
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,520
Right.
So we won't have to cheat at all.

162
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:56,158
–That's HOW we're cheating, Dougal.
–Oh, right, Ok…

163
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,028
So let me get this straight.
You'll be wearing the hat?

164
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,759
No, I won't be wearing any hats.

165
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,910
The tickets will be in the hat.

166
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,680
But you'll put on the hat
to give me the signal?

167
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,871
I won't be giving you any signals!

168
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:14,640
I'll just pull out your ticket
and you'll collect the prize!

169
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,831
–There's a prize, Ted? What is it?
–The car!

170
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,512
Oh, right, yeah.

171
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,353
Here's the sandwiches for tonight.

172
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,238
Oh, wait a minute,
I forgot to do my test!

173
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,878
What test, Mrs Doyle?

174
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,600
I select a sandwich at random
and try it.

175
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:33,468
If it doesn't meet my standards,
I put the lot in the bin.

176
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,953
They're fine.

177
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,284
–Right, so, are we all sorted?
–Ho, raring to go, Ted!

178
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:09,591
–Who's doing the disco?
–Father Billy O'Dwyer.

179
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,114
The Spinmaster! Great.

180
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,630
Actually, I can't wait.
I bet I sell a load of tickets.

181
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,591
I bet I sell more than you.

182
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,033
Hmm.

183
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,076
It's like The Sting.

184
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,932
I'm Robert Redford
and you're Paul Newman.

185
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,880
(Man on PA)
<i>Testing— one, two, one, two.</i>

186
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,354
Ground Control to the Spinmaster!

187
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,476
Oh, Ted! How are ya?

188
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,280
Fine. God, it's like NASA.
How do you keep track of it all?

189
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,231
It's quite simple, really.

190
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,950
Here we have the turntables,
which I control from the mixing desk.

191
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,400
I can flip between records if I want
to get a bit of an old jam going.

192
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,080
I can't wait.
What records have you got?

193
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,510
–Records?
–A bit of the Bee Gees, I suppose?

194
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,068
–Oh, God.
–Billy, what's up with you?

195
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,116
I forgot the records, Ted.

196
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,510
What⁈ Have you not got any records?

197
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,477
Now, hold on a second…

198
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,992
I might have one.
I think I have one out in the car.

199
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,678
Cup of tea, Father?

200
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,080
Would you like to be
the first to buy a raffle ticket?

201
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,280
I'd love to. I haven't taken part
in a raffle in donkey's years.

202
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,026
I think I'm in
with a great chance today.

203
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,110
–(Giggling)
–Shut up, Dougal!

204
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,952
–How many?
–Just the one.

205
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,314
Ah, all right.

206
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:39,359
–My lucky number never lets me down.
–Which one's that?

207
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,839
–11.
–What?

208
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,229
11's always been lucky for me.

209
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:47,029
–Eh… well, we're out of 11s.
–I'm your first customer.

210
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,033
Yes, yes. But… I think
this one came without 11s.

211
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,200
I'll give you a 10 and a one
and that'll add up to 11.

212
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,800
You can have both for 50p.

213
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,760
No, I don't think so.
I'll have my money back.

214
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,234
Mrs Doyle, it's for the roof…

215
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,912
Sorry, Father.

216
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:07,550
Incredible woman!
Now, I wonder where Jack's got to.

217
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,560
–He's with Father Purcell.
–I better rescue him!

218
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,052
They're just chatting.

219
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,960
Purcell's the most boring priest
in the world.

220
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,360
He was working in Nigeria,
and he woke up to find

221
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,640
everyone had had enough of him
and gone off in a boat.

222
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:25,300
It sank after a mile and they were
eaten by alligators. I'd better go.

223
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,914
we run the gas off the electricity

224
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,676
and the electricity off the gas
and we save £200 a year!

225
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,654
But then a few weeks later—
God, I'll never forget it, now—

226
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,029
we got a new boiler.

227
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,236
–All right, Fathers?
–HELP ME!

228
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,950
Hello, Ted. I was telling Father Jack
about the thing there last year.

229
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,680
–How did you fare with yours?
–I don't know…

230
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:55,960
Because you know, they have no morals
and no respect for human life.

231
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,436
But what they do have,
and no one can deny this,

232
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,960
they have the finest collection
of boilers in the world.

233
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,309
And I include Canada in that.

234
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,480
Fine, Anthony,
I want to borrow Jack for a moment.

235
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,112
THANk CHRIST!

236
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,633
Father?

237
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:15,998
Ahh, I remember the first time
I saw that boiler! Beautiful!

238
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,000
Would you like a ticket, Father?

239
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:21,920
Did you get those specially?
You can buy them down the shop.

240
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,439
Any number you like—

241
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:27,115
ah… one… seven…

242
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,396
20…

243
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,550
–112…
–112?

244
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,598
All the way up to 409, I think it is.

245
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,160
If you want more,
they send off for them.

246
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,080
They come back in an envelope.

247
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:44,557
Normal kind of thing.
Rectangular, four corners, you know.

248
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:48,138
That's the way I like them anyway,
the old envelopes.

249
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,470
No round envelopes for me!
No way, Hose.

250
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,120
(Purcell) Sid Vicious, now.
That was a grand name, wasn't it?

251
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,000
He had trouble with the drugs…

252
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,917
Oh-ho-ho!

253
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,638
Yes!

254
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,678
Tickets for the raffle.

255
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:07,680
Anybody who hasn't bought a ticket,
come over here.

256
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,314
Thank you very much. Thank you.

257
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:14,109
Sorry about the wait, folks—
trouble with the old disco.

258
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,480
Luckily, I've got a few old pals
to do a couple of numbers.

259

Billy, where have you been?

262
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,756
Ted! Found the record!

263
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,960
All right. How about a ticket?
50p each or four for £1.

264
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,357
Gambling, Ted.
Ruined me father and me grandfather.

265
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,600
Both of them, Ted,
died without a penny to their name.

266
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,880
It won't happen to me.

267
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,880
God, it's for charity.
It's not real gambling.

268
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,751
All right, then, go ahead.

269
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,512
Great. How many?

270
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,033
2·000.

271
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,839
–2·000?
–I'll do you a cheque.

272
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,200
No, I can't take it, that's too much.

273
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,626
I can handle it, Ted!

274
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:07,960
I've a few friends who lend me cash
from time to time.

275
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,120
No, you shouldn't throw around
that kind of money.

276
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:14,320
Ted, I need another ticket book.
This one's run out.

277
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,840
Already? How could you
sell out already⁈

278
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,714
Don't ask me.
I can hardly keep a straight face.

279
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,360
What was it, Billy— 2·000?

Thank you, Father Billy.

Let's get on to the important
stuff— the raffle!

290
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:23,350
The last raffle I was at
was very interesting

291
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,004
because the people who ran the raffle
actually won it.

292
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,440
So it's not unusual
for that to happen now and again.

293
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,075
Right? Ok, the winning number is…

294
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,592
Number 11!

295
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,678
Number… 11.

296
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:52,158
Number 11. If anyone has that number,
come up on stage!

297
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,119
What's that, Father McGuire?
You have the winning number?

298
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,758
What?

299
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,992
A round of applause for our
very own Father Dougal McGuire!

300
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,594
God Almighty, what were you doing?

301
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:11,116
Sorry. I was looking
at the ticket upside-down.

302
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,794
Well, congratulations, Father Dougal.

303
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,200
Anyway, what a
fantastic evening we've had.

304
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:20,600
We've raised enough to repair
the roof and had a great time.

305
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,359
So let me just thank you for coming

00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:45,676
For God's sake, I'll have
the money for you next week!

309
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:50,993
Please, please, one more chance,
that's all I ask. Please! Please!

310
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,192
Oh, thanks very much, Mrs Doyle.

311
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,312
For God's sake, have some pity!
I'm a priest!

312
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,597
They have you every way, you know.

313
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:03,911
I was in the AA there for a while.

314
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,471
–The insurance was very expensive.
–Oh, right…

315
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:12,872
I had to crash the car
just to get the money back.

316
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,909
Then they had witnesses who saw me
steer it towards the wall.

317
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,913
There was talk of me
going to jail for a while and…

318
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,718
Ah, it's Yourself.

319
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,080
What can I do for you, Mrs Doyle?

320
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,839
Terrible news. It's Father Finnegan!

321
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,673
–He's had a heart attack!
–No!

322
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:38,280
The doctors warned him to cut it down
to 12 hours a day,

323
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,276
but he couldn't stop dancing!

324
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,351
That's terrible news.

325
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:45,640
–What's up, Ted?
–Father Finnegan had a heart attack.

326
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,069
No! Are there any more Chipsticks?

327
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,720
Does that mean
we can keep the car?

328
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,671
Dougal! The man has just…

329
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,194
Wait! You're right! We can!

330
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,593
Father…

331
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,238
FECk OFF!

332
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,696
Where did you get the air freshener?

333
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,470
–Car!
–Oh, God.

334
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,118
Drived the car!

335
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,557
Not the new car? Tell me the truth
—have you been drinking?

336
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,073
Yes!

337
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,593
From the beginning.
Where did you drive?

338
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,829
Shops! Drink!

339
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:26,151
Corner. Stopped. Got out.

340
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,831
–Truck.
–A truck?

341
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,751
Two trucks.

342
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:36,913
Let's take a look. Maybe there's
something we can salvage.

343
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,678
It's not that bad, Ted.

344
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,954
Yes, God, I thought it'd be
much worse than that.

345
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,514
Oh…

346
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,715
bollocks.

347
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,915
Dougal, how is this “not that bad”?

348
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,669
At least we've got the raffle money.

349
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,355
Please!
Just give me 24 hours! Please!

350
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,351
(Line goes dead)

351
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,510
(Thunder)

352
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:26,080
(Man on TV) <i>So we'll probably
be seeing a lot more rain,</i>

353
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:29,715
<i>at least until July,
or possibly until August.</i>

354
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,640
God Almighty!
Imagine anyone being so dishonest

355
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:38,513
as to steal raffle money
from a priest!

356
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,558
Well, now,
the raffle WAS rigged, Ted.

357
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:47,280
I suppose we'll be Ok, as long as a
tree doesn't fall through the roof.

358
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,550
(Thunder crashes)

359
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,304
For a moment, I thought…

360
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,072
(Crash)

361
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,793
This is a piece of advice
my father gave to me.

362
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:09,635
Now, this not only refers to lagging,
but all forms of insulation.

363
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:13,354
He said, “Don't ever…”

364
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:18,468
No, no, it was,
“Always! Always re…” No!

365
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:21,279
It was, “Never…”
Oh, I've forgotten.

366
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,989
Never mind.
What's your favourite humming noise?

367
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:28,516
Would it be “hmmmm”

368
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,956
or would it be “hmmm-MMMMM”?

369
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:35,635
The first one there,
that's the sound of a fridge.

370
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:39,679
The second one,
that's the sound of a man humming.

371
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,149
You never hear a woman humming.

372
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,949
I knew a woman once,
but she died soon afterwards.

373
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:52,750
Now, if you push me, I'd have to say
my favourite colour was grey…

374
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:55,957
no, blue, a soft blue,
with a hint of grey.

375
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:59,430
No, orange. Orange.
That's it, I remember.

376
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,292
I have an extension
put on the house, now.

377
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,550
I put it on the extension,

378
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,346
so the house is
in a circle now, you see?

378
00:24:08,305 --> 00:25:08,474
