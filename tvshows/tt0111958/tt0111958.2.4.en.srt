00:00:32,957 --> 00:00:37,426
..so he was having an affair with the
sister when his wife was in hospital.

3
00:00:37,515 --> 00:00:39,710
- Wow.
- Incredible, isn't it?

4
00:00:39,795 --> 00:00:41,750
So he makes the baby-sitter pregnant.

5
00:00:41,834 --> 00:00:45,826
He doesn't know whether to stay with
the wife, sister or the baby-sitter!

6
00:00:45,913 --> 00:00:50,382
- When's his next confession?
- Tuesday. I'll keep you posted.

7
00:00:50,471 --> 00:00:52,938
Anyway, I'm really
looking forward to this.

8
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:55,463
Me, too. It's great
to take a day off.

9
00:00:55,549 --> 00:00:57,937
It shouldn't
be just work, work, work.

10
00:00:58,028 --> 00:01:00,939
It's not as if everybody will join
some mad religious cult

11
00:01:01,027 --> 00:01:02,983
just because we go for a picnic.

12
00:01:03,067 --> 00:01:06,103
I heard about those cults.
Everybody dressing in black

13
00:01:06,186 --> 00:01:10,541
and saying our Lord's
going to come back and judge us all.

14
00:01:10,624 --> 00:01:12,500
No... No, Dougal,

15
00:01:12,583 --> 00:01:15,540
that's us, that's Catholicism
you're talking about.

16
00:01:15,622 --> 00:01:17,214
Oh, right. Right.

17
00:01:17,302 --> 00:01:20,691
Right, here's the sandwiches
for the picnic.

18
00:01:20,781 --> 00:01:22,736
The rest are in the kitchen.

19
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:25,538
- Great.
- I hope you enjoy them, Father.

20
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:29,008
I love a sandwich. Any flavour,
as long as it isn't egg.

21
00:01:29,098 --> 00:01:33,214
You know how much I hate egg. Even
the smell brings me out in a rash.

22
00:01:33,296 --> 00:01:37,652
I wouldn't eat an egg sandwich
if you paid me. Stinking things!

23
00:01:37,735 --> 00:01:41,885
Remember me telling you, anything
except egg? Anything but egg.

24
00:01:41,973 --> 00:01:43,929
- They're egg, aren't they?
- Yes.

25
00:01:44,013 --> 00:01:47,084
- Great.
- I'll eat them. I love egg.

26
00:01:47,172 --> 00:01:51,322
Sometimes I think I like egg so much
that I'll turn into a giant egg.

27
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:55,722
I think that process
has already begun.

28
00:01:55,809 --> 00:01:57,719
- Sorry, Ted?
- No, nothing.

29
00:01:57,808 --> 00:02:00,526
- So, ready?
- Ready as I'll ever be, Ted.

30
00:02:00,607 --> 00:02:05,235
I don't think I've looked forward
to anything as much as this picnic.

31
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:09,715
- Right, so.
- Oh, I just remembered. I can't go.

32
00:02:09,804 --> 00:02:10,838
(Doorbell)

33
00:02:17,481 --> 00:02:19,233
Is Dougal in?

34
00:02:22,399 --> 00:02:24,788
- Hello, Father.
- Hello, Sergeant.

35
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,311
Just doing the rounds.

36
00:02:26,398 --> 00:02:29,309
On the trail of some crazed murderer,
no doubt.

37
00:02:29,397 --> 00:02:31,432
- What was that?
- Sorry?

38
00:02:31,516 --> 00:02:35,554
- A crazed murderer! When was this?
- I was only joking.

39
00:02:35,635 --> 00:02:39,309
Oh, right. If you ever hear
of a crazed murderer, report it.

40
00:02:39,394 --> 00:02:42,146
- It'd give me something to do.
- Right.

41
00:02:42,233 --> 00:02:44,905
- It's very quiet here.
- It is, yes.

42
00:02:44,992 --> 00:02:49,347
So if you hear of anything, you know.
A car wrongly parked - anything.

43
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:52,345
Tax up-to-date on that car?

44
00:02:52,429 --> 00:02:54,783
- It is, yes.
- Thought so.

45
00:02:54,868 --> 00:02:56,824
Bye, Sergeant.

46
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:03,298
- Who was that young priest, Father?
- Oh, I don't know.

47
00:03:03,385 --> 00:03:06,376
So Father McGuire isn't going
on the picnic, then?

48
00:03:06,464 --> 00:03:08,341
No. Never mind.

49
00:03:08,424 --> 00:03:11,858
I'm meeting Larry Duff and a few of
the lads. Better give them a call.

50
00:03:13,382 --> 00:03:15,770
- All egg, yeah?
- Yes.

51
00:03:17,261 --> 00:03:18,659
(Mobile phone rings)

52
00:03:26,298 --> 00:03:28,731
Hello? Ah, hello, Ted.

53
00:03:28,817 --> 00:03:31,330
- Hello, Larry. How are you?
- Ah, grand.

54
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:35,851
Bit of a problem, though. We mightn't
be able to make the picnic.

55
00:03:35,934 --> 00:03:37,447
Ah, God, Larry. Why?

56
00:03:37,534 --> 00:03:41,650
You know Father Williams
who was driving us over?

57
00:03:41,732 --> 00:03:43,404
(Ted) 'Billy? What about him?'

58
00:03:43,492 --> 00:03:48,006
Well, they found a big box
of machineguns in his house.

59
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:50,683
Didn't think he'd be interested
in that type of thing.

60
00:03:50,769 --> 00:03:53,680
Ah, yeah, well.
You think you know someone...

61
00:03:53,768 --> 00:03:57,157
Anyway, there you go. Bye. Bye...

62
00:04:01,525 --> 00:04:04,119
Oh, well. Just myself, I suppose.

63
00:04:09,883 --> 00:04:11,281
(Father Jack mutters)

64
00:04:14,281 --> 00:04:16,236
- (Bottles clink)
- Drink!

65
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,948
It's not drink, Father.
It's just fizzy water.

66
00:04:20,039 --> 00:04:22,632
Jacob's Creek Chardonnay, 1991!

67
00:04:23,718 --> 00:04:27,153
- You can tell just from the sound?!
- Drink! Drink! Drink!

68
00:04:27,237 --> 00:04:30,069
Father, I was thinking of going on
a little picnic.

69
00:04:30,156 --> 00:04:32,305
On my own. Outside.

70
00:04:33,275 --> 00:04:38,142
You wouldn't like it, Father. You'd
be much happier here. That is... I...

71
00:04:38,233 --> 00:04:40,382
(Wind howls)

72
00:05:02,345 --> 00:05:06,495
- Here, d'you want one?
- Ah, no, thanks, Father Lennon.

73
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:10,734
- What time's your tea ready?
- Frosty usually has it about six.

74
00:05:10,822 --> 00:05:14,415
- Who?
- Frosty. Father Frost.

75
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,411
Oh, wow! Frosty. Brilliant!

76
00:05:18,459 --> 00:05:20,414
What d'you call YOUR fella?

77
00:05:20,498 --> 00:05:22,409
- Who, Ted?
- Yeah.

78
00:05:22,498 --> 00:05:24,453
Well, just Ted.

79
00:05:25,657 --> 00:05:27,612
But it's the way I say it, you know?

80
00:05:27,696 --> 00:05:30,812
- He's an awful eejit, isn't he?
- Yeah!

81
00:05:30,895 --> 00:05:34,772
Here, which one do you prefer -
Oasis or Blur?

82
00:05:34,853 --> 00:05:36,809
- Blur.
- What?!

83
00:05:36,893 --> 00:05:39,281
Oasis! I mean Oasis!

84
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:41,760
Father Damien, your tea is ready!

85
00:05:41,851 --> 00:05:44,205
I'll be in in a minute!

86
00:05:48,329 --> 00:05:49,647
(Snoring)

87
00:05:57,406 --> 00:05:59,316
Great! Here we go.

88
00:06:01,644 --> 00:06:04,555
(Man ) What the fup
are you doing here?

89
00:06:04,643 --> 00:06:07,839
This is my fuppin' spot.
Get the fup off!

90
00:06:07,922 --> 00:06:11,311
- Hit him, Frank.
- Could you not go over there?

91
00:06:11,401 --> 00:06:12,833
No fuppin' way!

92
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,831
F-U-P O-F-F.

93
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,830
Fup off! We come here
every fuppin' Sunday.

94
00:06:18,918 --> 00:06:22,193
- But this is Saturday.
- Hit him. I'll hit him for you.

95
00:06:22,277 --> 00:06:26,110
She fuppin' would, and so would I,
you fuppin' backstard!

96
00:06:26,196 --> 00:06:28,231
Why are you talking like that?

97
00:06:31,274 --> 00:06:33,992
So fup off, you grasshole!

98
00:06:34,073 --> 00:06:37,951
- But I don't see...
- Right! I'm callin' the fuppin' man!

99
00:06:38,032 --> 00:06:40,784
Hey! Hey! Hey!

100
00:06:40,871 --> 00:06:42,826
(Blows whistle furiously)

101
00:06:46,549 --> 00:06:48,300
What's the problem?

102
00:06:48,388 --> 00:06:51,857
Listen, this backstard priest
is in our spot!

103
00:06:53,307 --> 00:06:56,741
- Look, we were just...
- Put the fork down.

104
00:06:56,825 --> 00:07:00,180
- What? Oh, I wasn't...
- Put the fork down!

105
00:07:00,264 --> 00:07:02,652
Put the fork DOWN!

106
00:07:05,582 --> 00:07:08,971
Now put your hands very slowly
to your sides.

107
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:10,858
Slowly!

108
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,451
All right...

109
00:07:14,539 --> 00:07:18,008
I'm going to put the megaphone
down now, all right?

110
00:07:18,098 --> 00:07:20,213
Nice and easy.

111
00:07:26,295 --> 00:07:27,774
Now...

112
00:07:27,855 --> 00:07:31,210
I'm going to reach
inside my pocket, all right?

113
00:07:31,294 --> 00:07:33,363
Nice and slow.

114
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:35,804
Everything's fine.

115
00:07:38,211 --> 00:07:39,280
Cigarette?

116
00:07:39,371 --> 00:07:41,725
No. To be honest,
I'm just going home.

117
00:07:43,929 --> 00:07:45,681
Fup off, you pedrophile!

118
00:07:45,769 --> 00:07:47,998
All right, come on. Come on.

119
00:07:48,088 --> 00:07:50,999
Nothing to see here.
Back to the picnic.

120
00:07:51,087 --> 00:07:52,838
(Blows whistle )

121
00:07:53,126 --> 00:07:54,525
(Slams bottle down )

122
00:07:55,605 --> 00:07:58,994
Ah, there you are. You wouldn't
believe the day I've had.

123
00:07:59,084 --> 00:08:00,994
I met the rudest couple.

124
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:03,755
And that fella, Benson,
with his bloody whistle.

125
00:08:03,842 --> 00:08:07,151
Somebody should take it off him.
Where did you go?

126
00:08:07,241 --> 00:08:09,152
I was with Father Damo Lennon.

127
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,151
- He's over with Frosty.
- Who?

128
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,672
Eh, Father Frost.

129
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:16,831
Oh, yes. FATHER Frost. He said
they might come over for a holiday.

130
00:08:16,918 --> 00:08:19,477
Father Damo's great.

131
00:08:19,557 --> 00:08:21,547
Why are you walking like that?

132
00:08:21,636 --> 00:08:23,944
- Like what, Ted?
- Like a crab.

133
00:08:24,035 --> 00:08:26,105
Oh, right. Sorry, Ted.

134
00:08:29,434 --> 00:08:31,822
- Dougal, what's that?
- What?

135
00:08:31,913 --> 00:08:33,345
This? Oh, nothing.

136
00:08:33,432 --> 00:08:36,821
- It's an earring.
- Oh, right. It is, all right.

137
00:08:38,271 --> 00:08:41,182
You can't go round
wearing an earring.

138
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:44,544
All the young priests wear them.
Father Damo has one.

139
00:08:44,628 --> 00:08:47,778
Oh, I see. Did Father Damo
give you the idea?

140
00:08:47,867 --> 00:08:50,016
Yeah. He's great.

141
00:08:50,106 --> 00:08:53,063
Next he'll be giving you
crack cocaine or something.

142
00:08:53,145 --> 00:08:55,897
Crack cocaine. Ah, come on, Ted.

143
00:08:59,303 --> 00:09:01,339
Well, you'll have to take it out.

144
00:09:01,423 --> 00:09:04,573
You don't know what's going
on with the young people.

145
00:09:04,661 --> 00:09:08,050
I was young once. The things
we got up to in the seminary!

146
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:13,576
Me and the lads, once we
mitched off to see a Dana concert.

147
00:09:13,658 --> 00:09:15,410
Dana!

148
00:09:15,498 --> 00:09:19,205
No one's listening to Dana any more.
You'd be mad to listen to her.

149
00:09:19,296 --> 00:09:22,685
Yeah? Father Bigley listens to Dana
and he's not mad.

150
00:09:22,775 --> 00:09:24,447
Why's he in that home, then?

151
00:09:25,814 --> 00:09:28,281
He's in that home...
because of those fires.

152
00:09:28,373 --> 00:09:32,285
That's nothing to do with Dana.
You'll have to take that earring out.

153
00:09:32,372 --> 00:09:36,000
I should be allowed
to do what I want. I am nearly 26.

154
00:09:36,091 --> 00:09:38,729
You still treat me like I was 24.

155
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:42,006
I'll start treating you
like a 26-year-old

156
00:09:42,089 --> 00:09:45,000
when you start acting
like a 26-year-old.

157
00:09:45,088 --> 00:09:47,043
Anyway, it's time for your bath.

158
00:09:47,127 --> 00:09:49,276
A bath! OH, NO!

159
00:10:12,838 --> 00:10:15,067
Hello, Father.

160
00:10:21,075 --> 00:10:22,474
Hello, Father.

161
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:24,306
Ah, hello.

162
00:10:24,394 --> 00:10:26,463
How are things?

163
00:10:26,553 --> 00:10:28,305
Fine! Fine!

164
00:10:28,393 --> 00:10:29,620
Good.

165
00:10:30,792 --> 00:10:32,747
I'll see you later.

166
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:34,787
Go, go, go, go, go!

167
00:10:43,588 --> 00:10:45,339
You bastard!

168
00:10:46,427 --> 00:10:48,178
Slag!

169
00:10:49,226 --> 00:10:51,693
- Hello, Mary.
- Hello, Father.

170
00:10:51,785 --> 00:10:52,933
Oh.

171
00:10:53,784 --> 00:10:56,092
- Hello, Father.
- Hello, John.

172
00:10:56,183 --> 00:11:01,653
Mary was just washing my hair.
She has such lovely, soft hands.

173
00:11:01,741 --> 00:11:04,174
I was just looking
for some firelighters.

174
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,694
I'll get them.
They're out the back.

175
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:09,088
I didn't know Sergeant Hodgins
had a helicopter.

176
00:11:09,179 --> 00:11:13,295
Oh, yes. He had to get one in
because of this whistle thing.

177
00:11:13,377 --> 00:11:16,368
- Oh. Whistle thing?
- Yeah. Look.

178
00:11:16,456 --> 00:11:18,686
(Mary) Isn't it terrible, Father?

179
00:11:19,775 --> 00:11:23,892
The whole island's talking about it.
Who would've thought law and order

180
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:27,965
- would break down on Craggy Island?
- (Mary) God help us all, Father!

181
00:11:28,052 --> 00:11:31,123
Yes, but I mean,
if it's only a whistle...

182
00:11:31,211 --> 00:11:34,122
I had to buy myself
a shotgun and everything.

183
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:37,803
I wouldn't hesitate
to use that, now.

184
00:11:37,889 --> 00:11:42,756
If that man came in and tried to
steal any of the whistles in here...

185
00:11:43,807 --> 00:11:46,445
I'd blow his feckin' head
off his shoulders!

186
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:48,484
(Laughs nervously)

187
00:11:48,565 --> 00:11:52,682
Look. I have it cocked an' all
so I can get the jump on him.

188
00:11:52,764 --> 00:11:56,472
Would it not be dangerous
to have it cocked like that?

189
00:11:56,563 --> 00:12:00,110
Not at all, Father. So long
as you don't suddenly drop it.

190
00:12:00,201 --> 00:12:01,998
(John laughs)

191
00:12:02,081 --> 00:12:07,312
There. If they don't work, bring them
back and we'll give you a refund.

192
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:09,309
Ok, so. Thanks very much.

193
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:13,315
You feckin' eejit! Give me that!

194
00:12:13,397 --> 00:12:15,910
Did you hear about the whistle
being stolen?

195
00:12:15,996 --> 00:12:18,634
- Yes...
- I never thought I'd see the like.

196
00:12:18,715 --> 00:12:22,548
What next? Somebody'll be murdered
and then where are we?

197
00:12:22,634 --> 00:12:26,591
Drive-by shootings in the night.
It'll be like Boyz N the Hood.

198
00:12:26,672 --> 00:12:30,266
Then they'll have whores
selling their wares on the street.

199
00:12:30,351 --> 00:12:33,740
The pimps'll be using crack
to keep the whores under control.

200
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:34,978
(Gunshot)

201
00:12:35,069 --> 00:12:39,380
I'm going to lock myself in the
basement until they catch that fella.

202
00:12:39,468 --> 00:12:41,423
Goodbye.

203
00:12:46,785 --> 00:12:50,697
Unbelievable! They really are making
too big a deal of this.

204
00:12:50,784 --> 00:12:54,492
And look - a special pull-out
supplement on whistles!

205
00:12:57,342 --> 00:12:58,740
I don't know...

206
00:12:58,821 --> 00:13:03,018
Dougal, aren't you going
to introduce me to your friend?

207
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,498
This is Father Damo.

208
00:13:04,579 --> 00:13:07,092
How're ya?

209
00:13:07,178 --> 00:13:10,567
Hello, Father.
Playing the old computer game there?

210
00:13:12,177 --> 00:13:14,132
(Phone )

211
00:13:17,175 --> 00:13:19,483
Hello. Father Ted Crilly speaking.

212
00:13:19,574 --> 00:13:23,771
Yes. Ah! Father Frost.
Yes, I'll tell him.

213
00:13:23,853 --> 00:13:28,242
Father Damien, Father Frost says
you're to go home. Your tea is ready.

214
00:13:28,331 --> 00:13:31,766
Tell him I'm not going.
I'm having dinner here.

215
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:33,601
Oh. Are you?

216
00:13:33,689 --> 00:13:37,522
Hello, Father?
No, he's staying here for dinner.

217
00:13:38,608 --> 00:13:42,804
Um, Father Damien, Father Frost said
you're to go home immediately.

218
00:13:42,886 --> 00:13:45,274
Shite! Did you tell him
I'm having dinner here?

219
00:13:45,365 --> 00:13:49,073
- Er...yes.
- Tell him to feck off, then.

220
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:56,953
He's happy enough here
for the moment, Father.

221
00:13:58,041 --> 00:14:01,191
Right. Ok.

222
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:06,031
Father Frost says if you don't
go home, he'll come and get you.

223
00:14:06,118 --> 00:14:09,587
I don't care what he does.
He's not the boss of me.

224
00:14:10,677 --> 00:14:12,428
Right...

225
00:14:13,795 --> 00:14:16,229
All right, all right! I'm going.

226
00:14:16,315 --> 00:14:18,908
Tell him I'm going.
I'll see you, Dougal.

227
00:14:20,393 --> 00:14:23,623
He's heading off now.
Yes, yes. Oh, right, yeah.

228
00:14:25,991 --> 00:14:27,709
Dougal, mind this for me.

229
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:30,224
- Oh, right.
- I'll get them later.

230
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:32,743
- Frosty hates me smoking.
- Ok, Damo.

231
00:14:32,829 --> 00:14:36,707
- You praying, yeah?
- Oh, no. They're, uh...Ted's.

232
00:14:36,788 --> 00:14:39,824
- See ya, right?
- See ya.

233
00:14:41,146 --> 00:14:42,465
(Ted) Dougal!

234
00:14:42,546 --> 00:14:45,457
Oh, God! What does he want now?

235
00:14:50,943 --> 00:14:52,898
Consonant, please, Carol.

236
00:14:55,341 --> 00:14:57,093
Vowel.

237
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,496
Another consonant.

238
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:02,050
Vowel.

239
00:15:02,139 --> 00:15:04,094
Consonant.

240
00:15:06,737 --> 00:15:08,693
Richard, where are you going?

241
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:13,164
Dougal, I am not Richard Whiteley.

242
00:15:13,255 --> 00:15:16,087
Go back to sleep. You're dreaming.

243
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:22,288
Consonant.

244
00:15:22,372 --> 00:15:25,807
Put your clothes back on, Carol,
I can't concentrate.

245
00:15:31,529 --> 00:15:36,157
- Tea, Father?
- God Almighty! Why are you up?

246
00:15:36,247 --> 00:15:40,159
I always stay up in case
one of you needs a cup of tea.

247
00:15:40,246 --> 00:15:43,078
How long have you been doing this?

248
00:15:43,165 --> 00:15:47,281
- Oh, about three years now.
- But we never get up at night.

249
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:49,081
You're up now, aren't you?

250
00:15:49,163 --> 00:15:51,960
Unless I'm hallucinating
from lack of sleep.

251
00:15:52,042 --> 00:15:54,953
That's happened before, all right.

252
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:58,555
I'm just getting my jacket
to go for a little walk.

253
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,595
Right, so.

254
00:16:20,872 --> 00:16:21,906
Dougal?

255
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:28,340
Oh, no!

256
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:38,138
Dougal... Is there anything
on your mind?

257
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:47,014
Let me rephrase that.

258
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:50,014
Is there anything
you want to tell me about?

259
00:16:50,102 --> 00:16:52,217
Something bothering you?

260
00:16:52,301 --> 00:16:53,780
Like what, Ted?

261
00:16:53,861 --> 00:16:57,169
Have you done anything
you might be embarrassed about?

262
00:16:57,259 --> 00:17:01,536
Have you done anything bad recently?
Anything wrong?

263
00:17:01,618 --> 00:17:03,096
Wrong?

264
00:17:03,177 --> 00:17:07,089
You remember right and wrong,
the difference between the two.

265
00:17:07,176 --> 00:17:09,928
Page one of How To Be A Catholic.

266
00:17:11,135 --> 00:17:14,489
Honestly, Dougal!
This is very basic stuff.

267
00:17:14,573 --> 00:17:17,723
Give me an example
of something that's wrong.

268
00:17:17,812 --> 00:17:21,087
Just give me a second, Ted.
I, er... I...

269
00:17:21,171 --> 00:17:22,763
(Ted) Arson - there's one.

270
00:17:22,851 --> 00:17:24,329
Murder...

271
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:26,603
Swearing.

272
00:17:26,689 --> 00:17:28,327
Swearing, yeah.

273
00:17:28,409 --> 00:17:30,444
- Anything else?
- Er...

274
00:17:30,528 --> 00:17:33,485
Erm... Er...

275
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:36,519
Lying?

276
00:17:36,606 --> 00:17:39,802
- Well done, Dougal! Yes!
- Thanks, Ted. I...

277
00:17:40,245 --> 00:17:42,200
Dougal, are you all right?

278
00:17:42,284 --> 00:17:45,002
I'm fine, Ted.
I just need to sit down.

279
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:47,994
Sorry about that.
Probably pushed you a bit hard.

280
00:17:48,082 --> 00:17:50,037
No worries, Ted.

281
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:57,391
Dougal, something else
that's wrong is stealing.

282
00:17:57,479 --> 00:18:00,231
What I'm trying to say is,
it's wrong to steal.

283
00:18:00,318 --> 00:18:03,150
- Stealing is something you don't do.
- Except you.

284
00:18:03,237 --> 00:18:04,430
Yes... What?

285
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:07,632
- You're allowed to steal.
- What're you talking about?

286
00:18:07,715 --> 00:18:10,103
The money from that Lourdes thing.

287
00:18:12,873 --> 00:18:14,829
Different thing altogether, Dougal.

288
00:18:14,913 --> 00:18:18,870
That money was just resting
in my account before I moved it on.

289
00:18:18,951 --> 00:18:21,464
- It was resting for a long time.
- Yes, but...

290
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:24,461
- A good, long rest.
- We're not talking about me!

291
00:18:24,549 --> 00:18:28,985
We're talking about YOU. Is there
anything you want to tell me about?

292
00:18:30,068 --> 00:18:32,217
This, for example?

293
00:18:32,307 --> 00:18:35,537
Father, Sergeant Hodgins
and Mr Benson are here.

294
00:18:35,626 --> 00:18:38,264
Dougal, you just go out
and get...the shears.

295
00:18:38,345 --> 00:18:41,017
- Right you are.
- Sorry to disturb you.

296
00:18:41,104 --> 00:18:44,015
I thought we might meet
and talk about this.

297
00:18:44,103 --> 00:18:46,900
- You've heard about the whistle?
- Yes.

298
00:18:46,982 --> 00:18:51,656
When I saw my whistle had been
stolen, I went into a state of shock

299
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,695
and lost the use of my legs.

300
00:18:53,779 --> 00:18:57,657
Well, one of them, anyhow.
This one's fine but this one -

301
00:18:57,738 --> 00:18:59,693
completely lost all feeling.

302
00:18:59,777 --> 00:19:01,688
Look.

303
00:19:01,777 --> 00:19:03,926
(Screams in agony)

304
00:19:04,016 --> 00:19:06,210
- Yes.
- Sweet Jesus!

305
00:19:06,295 --> 00:19:08,683
The shock also affected his memory.

306
00:19:08,774 --> 00:19:12,163
It's actually THAT
leg that there's no feeling in.

307
00:19:12,253 --> 00:19:15,449
Anyhow - come on, Father.
Did you hear anything?

308
00:19:15,532 --> 00:19:17,806
- About what?
- About my whistle!

309
00:19:17,891 --> 00:19:20,245
Did you hear anything
during confession?

310
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:24,607
No! Now, come on!
The confessional is sacrosanct.

311
00:19:24,689 --> 00:19:27,566
I have had that whistle
for 40 years.

312
00:19:27,648 --> 00:19:29,603
It saved my grandfather's life.

313
00:19:29,687 --> 00:19:31,120
- Did it really?
- It did.

314
00:19:31,207 --> 00:19:33,640
He was being executed by the British.

315
00:19:33,726 --> 00:19:36,876
They had him up against a wall
and they shot him.

316
00:19:36,965 --> 00:19:41,161
And the bullets hit the whistle
in his pocket and bounced off him.

317
00:19:41,243 --> 00:19:43,073
God Almighty! So he survived?

318
00:19:43,162 --> 00:19:45,835
No, no. They just reloaded,
shot him again.

319
00:19:46,921 --> 00:19:50,833
Listen, Father, I don't want
to be saying anything, but, erm...

320
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,830
Jim saw someone.

321
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:55,512
- Yes?
- He didn't get a good look,

322
00:19:55,598 --> 00:19:57,190
but he did notice something.

323
00:19:57,278 --> 00:20:01,952
The collar. Jim said it was a priest
who stole the whistle.

324
00:20:02,036 --> 00:20:03,991
Oh, right. That'd be Ted.

325
00:20:07,034 --> 00:20:10,184
- What?!
- You were talking about stealing

326
00:20:10,273 --> 00:20:13,423
and you showed me the whistle -
you put it in your top pocket.

327
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:16,071
(Ted) No, Dougal.

328
00:20:16,151 --> 00:20:20,507
No, it is, Ted. Try your top pocket.
I bet you it's in there.

329
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:22,819
I'm sure it is. Give it a go.

330
00:20:26,028 --> 00:20:28,939
Just a bit more to your right, there.

331
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:31,665
Yes, Dougal. Thank you.

332
00:20:31,746 --> 00:20:33,940
Oh! Right! Yes.

333
00:20:34,025 --> 00:20:35,980
Well, there's an obvious explanation.

334
00:20:36,064 --> 00:20:39,294
- Is there, Father?
- Yes, of course there is.

335
00:20:39,383 --> 00:20:40,782
What is it, Ted?

336
00:20:40,863 --> 00:20:43,774
I have to leave the room
for a couple of minutes.

337
00:20:43,862 --> 00:20:46,500
When I return,
I'll have a full explanation.

338
00:20:46,581 --> 00:20:50,095
- It had better be a good one.
- It'll be perfectly satisfactory.

339
00:20:50,179 --> 00:20:52,534
Excuse me for a couple of minutes.

340
00:21:08,093 --> 00:21:10,402
So, I hear your baby-sitter
got pregnant.

341
00:21:13,212 --> 00:21:15,122
Father, more visitors.

342
00:21:15,211 --> 00:21:17,360
- Father Frost is here.
- Get off!

343
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:22,000
Right. I believe there's a Mr Benson
who's had a whistle stolen.

344
00:21:22,089 --> 00:21:24,363
- That's me.
- I have the culprit here.

345
00:21:24,448 --> 00:21:26,836
- What?
- Yeah, I stole it.

346
00:21:26,927 --> 00:21:29,076
So what?
It's only a bleedin' whistle.

347
00:21:30,566 --> 00:21:32,874
I saw this eejit
with a whistle on Tuesday.

348
00:21:32,965 --> 00:21:36,036
Then I heard Mr Benson's
whistle had gone missing.

349
00:21:36,124 --> 00:21:40,001
This eejit tried to put the blame
on Father McGuire.

350
00:21:40,082 --> 00:21:43,437
- It was my fault for stealing it.
- But you didn't steal it, Father.

351
00:21:43,521 --> 00:21:44,874
Oh, right.

352
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,395
He hid it in a packet
of cigarettes, apparently.

353
00:21:50,479 --> 00:21:52,434
That must be how we got hold of it.

354
00:21:52,518 --> 00:21:54,826
Father Damien gave me
the cigarettes to mind.

355
00:21:54,917 --> 00:21:55,952
(All) Ah!

356
00:21:56,037 --> 00:21:58,425
Right! I have a full explanation.

357
00:21:58,516 --> 00:21:59,471
Father...

358
00:21:59,556 --> 00:22:03,627
I was just about to tell everybody
why I stole the whistle.

359
00:22:03,714 --> 00:22:04,829
No, Father...

360
00:22:04,914 --> 00:22:07,552
I've been dying to get it
off my chest.

361
00:22:07,633 --> 00:22:11,591
- Ted...
- 15 years ago, I met a young orphan.

362
00:22:11,672 --> 00:22:16,061
Both his parents had been killed
in a bizarre accident...

363
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:18,060
That's it - a tree fell on them.

364
00:22:18,149 --> 00:22:22,903
This young man had nothing
to his name except a dream.

365
00:22:22,988 --> 00:22:23,976
- Ted...
- Shut up.

366
00:22:24,067 --> 00:22:28,059
His dream was to own his own stable,
with prize-winning horses.

367
00:22:28,146 --> 00:22:31,615
But he was afflicted by a disease
that affected his speech.

368
00:22:31,705 --> 00:22:34,457
He could only communicate
by raising his eyebrows -

369
00:22:34,544 --> 00:22:36,135
once for yes, twice for no.

370
00:22:36,223 --> 00:22:38,099
"If only I had a whistle

371
00:22:38,182 --> 00:22:42,094
"so I could train my horses to win
the Grand National," he thought.

372
00:22:42,181 --> 00:22:45,172
That same boy wrote to me
five weeks ago...

373
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:46,772
Father Damien took the whistle.

374
00:22:46,859 --> 00:22:50,487
Oh, great. That's that sorted out.
See you soon.

375
00:22:50,578 --> 00:22:52,693
What's all this about the horses?

376
00:22:52,777 --> 00:22:54,733
Nothing. I was just going mad.

377
00:22:54,817 --> 00:22:56,966
I have to say one of those masses.

378
00:22:57,056 --> 00:22:59,967
- When's tea ready?
- No tea for you.

379
00:23:00,055 --> 00:23:02,488
Good. I don't want any stupid tea!

380
00:23:03,974 --> 00:23:07,203
Don't put too much faith
in people who are "cool".

381
00:23:07,292 --> 00:23:10,727
They're usually on the fast track
to a life of crime.

382
00:23:10,811 --> 00:23:13,085
Father Lennon may have
had a trendy haircut

383
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:15,730
but he lacked that inner dignity
of priesthood.

384
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:18,118
- Drink!
- With you in a moment.

385
00:23:18,209 --> 00:23:21,756
The Church has no place
for bad apples

386
00:23:21,847 --> 00:23:24,758
like Father Damien
or the Bishop of Galway

387
00:23:24,846 --> 00:23:28,360
or that friend of Father Bigley's
who was sending arms to Iraq.

388
00:23:28,445 --> 00:23:29,878
The list goes on and on.

389
00:23:29,965 --> 00:23:32,558
What's important
is that we're back to normal.

390
00:23:32,644 --> 00:23:34,315
You're right there, Ted.

391
00:23:34,403 --> 00:23:37,633
So, have you learned anything
from your experience?

392
00:23:40,641 --> 00:23:41,790
No.

393
00:23:42,305 --> 00:24:42,369
