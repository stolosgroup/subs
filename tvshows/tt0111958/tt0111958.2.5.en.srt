2
00:00:43,395 --> 00:00:46,067
Ted, have you seen
my record collection?

3
00:00:46,154 --> 00:00:47,826
- Record collection?
- Yeah.

4
00:00:47,914 --> 00:00:49,824
Here it is. And Dougal,

5
00:00:49,913 --> 00:00:53,700
you need more than one record
to have a collection.

6
00:00:53,792 --> 00:00:55,702
What YOU have is a record.

7
00:00:56,791 --> 00:00:58,747
Oh, right. Yeah.

8
00:00:58,831 --> 00:01:01,469
(Humming Nessun Dorma )

9
00:01:07,468 --> 00:01:10,379
You know,
you've a beautiful voice, Father.

10
00:01:11,667 --> 00:01:13,622
Ah, no, I don't really.

11
00:01:13,706 --> 00:01:15,936
No, you do. It's gorgeous.

12
00:01:16,026 --> 00:01:17,902
Well, thanks very much.

13
00:01:17,985 --> 00:01:22,023
I don't think I've ever heard
anything more beautiful in my life.

14
00:01:22,104 --> 00:01:24,173
Sing something else.

15
00:01:24,263 --> 00:01:27,334
Now, I don't normally do requests.

16
00:01:27,422 --> 00:01:29,458
Ah, go on, now. Please!

17
00:01:31,061 --> 00:01:32,210
Ok.

18
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:36,737
# I-I love Paris
in the springtime

19
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:41,050
# I love Paris in the fall... #

20
00:01:42,418 --> 00:01:43,692
No.

21
00:01:43,777 --> 00:01:45,972
No, I didn't like
that one so much.

22
00:01:46,057 --> 00:01:48,490
I was a bit disappointed
with that one.

23
00:01:48,576 --> 00:01:51,567
- Yes, thank you, Mrs Doyle.
- That wasn't very good at all.

24
00:01:51,655 --> 00:01:53,373
Yes...

25
00:01:53,455 --> 00:01:55,968
I love that song,
but that was catastrophic.

26
00:01:56,054 --> 00:02:00,604
I tell you what, Mrs Doyle,
I won't book Carnegie Hall just yet.

27
00:02:00,693 --> 00:02:04,684
They wouldn't let you play Carnegie
Hall with a voice like that.

28
00:02:05,851 --> 00:02:09,684
Carnegie Hall. Oh, here's one.
How do you get to Carnegie Hall?

29
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:12,647
- Practice!
- What?

30
00:02:14,249 --> 00:02:18,240
That old joke - "How d'you get
to Carnegie Hall?  Practice!"

31
00:02:18,327 --> 00:02:19,680
Uh?

32
00:02:20,647 --> 00:02:22,079
Oh, I-I see.

33
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:25,362
Um, you'd have to go
to New York, Dougal.

34
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:31,440
Oh, right. Yeah. Ted...
do you mind if I put on my record?

35
00:02:31,524 --> 00:02:33,718
No. Go ahead.

36
00:02:33,803 --> 00:02:36,680
- I've got Eurosong fever, Ted.
- Yeah?

37
00:02:36,762 --> 00:02:40,117
God, yeah. I love the Eurosong
competition. I can't wait.

38
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:42,953
- What time is it now?
- Half past one.

39
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,474
And the competition is on in...?

40
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,515
May.

41
00:02:49,238 --> 00:02:52,628
You know they're looking
for entries for this year?

42
00:02:53,717 --> 00:02:55,435
- Are they?
- Yeah.

43
00:02:55,517 --> 00:02:57,029
- Dougal...
- Why...?

44
00:02:57,116 --> 00:02:58,754
- Dougal!
- Ah, Ted...

45
00:02:58,836 --> 00:03:01,633
- Dougal!
- If we won, we'd be famous,

46
00:03:01,715 --> 00:03:04,626
like Nelson Mandela
and his mad wife.

47
00:03:04,714 --> 00:03:07,147
No, Dougal,
we don't have the time.

48
00:03:07,233 --> 00:03:08,985
We'd have to write a song.

49
00:03:09,073 --> 00:03:11,745
That needs a person
with special talent.

50
00:03:11,832 --> 00:03:14,982
Cole Porter,
George Gershwin, Chris de Burgh...

51
00:03:15,071 --> 00:03:17,220
- (Phone )
- Not just any old eejit

52
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:20,267
can take up
songwriting just like that.

53
00:03:20,349 --> 00:03:22,101
Hello. Father Ted Crilly.

54
00:03:22,189 --> 00:03:25,180
- Hello! Dick Byrne here.
- Dick.

55
00:03:25,268 --> 00:03:27,986
- Are you entering this year?
- 'What?'

56
00:03:28,067 --> 00:03:31,775
Eurosong '96. The young fella
has me driven mad with it.

57
00:03:31,866 --> 00:03:35,540
We thought we'd enter.
Why don't you give it a go?

58
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:37,535
- I'm sure you'd win.
- Thanks...

59
00:03:37,624 --> 00:03:40,536
If all the other contestants
were killed!

60
00:03:40,624 --> 00:03:43,057
We'd do just as well as you would.

61
00:03:43,143 --> 00:03:44,495
- You wouldn't.
- Yes, we would.

62
00:03:44,582 --> 00:03:45,810
- You wouldn't.
- We would.

63
00:03:45,902 --> 00:03:47,971
- No, you wouldn't.
- Yes, we would.

64
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,700
- No, you wouldn't.
- We would, we would, we would!

65
00:03:50,781 --> 00:03:52,611
- You wouldn't times a thousand!
- Yes...

66
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,656
Jinx! No comebacks!

67
00:03:58,019 --> 00:03:59,974
Dougal, get the guitar.

68
00:04:00,058 --> 00:04:02,730
- I thought...
- I said get the guitar!

69
00:04:07,736 --> 00:04:10,169
Ok, right. What'll we write it about?

70
00:04:11,415 --> 00:04:13,723
How about...a lovely horse?

71
00:04:18,613 --> 00:04:23,082
Ok. We'll call it...
My Lovely Horse...

72
00:04:24,171 --> 00:04:26,889
by Father...Ted...Crilly.

73
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:29,086
And, er, Father Dougal McGuire.

74
00:04:31,169 --> 00:04:34,285
And, er...Father...Dougal...McGuire.

75
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,006
Right. Here we go.

76
00:04:37,087 --> 00:04:40,635
Um, will we do the lyrics first
or will we do the music?

77
00:04:40,726 --> 00:04:43,478
Let's do the lyrics
and fit the tune around it.

78
00:04:43,565 --> 00:04:44,964
Right. Here we go.

79
00:04:52,523 --> 00:04:54,956
Maybe we should do the music first.

80
00:04:55,042 --> 00:04:57,475
Right. Here we go.

81
00:04:57,561 --> 00:04:59,313
I like that.

82
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,357
- Was that all right?
- Yeah. It was a bit sad.

83
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:09,556
Good. Good. I'll write it down.
I think it was an A minor.

84
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:13,789
I-I think... I think I have a lyric.

85
00:05:13,877 --> 00:05:16,265
Right. Lyrics.
Go ahead there, Dougal.

86
00:05:16,356 --> 00:05:18,311
What's it called again?

87
00:05:19,515 --> 00:05:21,186
My Lovely Horse.

88
00:05:22,194 --> 00:05:24,150
Right. How about this? Er...

89
00:05:24,234 --> 00:05:26,986
My lovely horse,
I want to hold you so tight

90
00:05:27,073 --> 00:05:30,587
I want to rub my fingers
through your tail

91
00:05:30,672 --> 00:05:32,582
and...love you all night.

92
00:05:32,671 --> 00:05:35,548
Dougal... Dougal, Dougal, stop there.

93
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:39,747
keep out of the whole area
of being in love with the horse.

94
00:05:39,829 --> 00:05:41,784
Oh, right. Right.

95
00:05:41,868 --> 00:05:44,143
We're more friends with the horse.

96
00:05:44,228 --> 00:05:47,378
We want to jump around
and have a good laugh with it.

97
00:05:47,467 --> 00:05:49,184
Right. What about,

98
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:52,655
Take this lump of sugar, baby,
you know you want it?

99
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:58,016
Something like those
rap fellas would write.

100
00:05:58,104 --> 00:06:00,378
You can forget about them, Dougal.

101
00:06:00,463 --> 00:06:04,250
You can forget about Icy Tea
and Scoopy Scoopy Dog Dog.

102
00:06:04,342 --> 00:06:07,094
They're no help to us now.

103
00:06:07,181 --> 00:06:10,252
We're not moving
until we've finished the song.

104
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,376
- Ready?
- Let's do it!

105
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:17,373
Dougal, don't take it so seriously,
it's...it's just a bit of fun.

106
00:06:21,377 --> 00:06:23,765
Just play the f---ing note!

107
00:06:27,775 --> 00:06:31,130
- The first one?
- No, not the f---ing first one!

108
00:06:31,214 --> 00:06:33,170
That's already f---ing down!

109
00:06:33,254 --> 00:06:36,370
Play the f---ing note
you were f---ing playing.

110
00:06:36,453 --> 00:06:40,490
I'm playing the f---ing first one!
We have the f---ing first one!

111
00:06:41,971 --> 00:06:43,529
(Can rattles)

112
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:46,889
So I...

113
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:49,927
Play the f---ing note
you were f---ing playing!

114
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:53,398
The thing you were just doing!
Play the f---ing note!

115
00:06:58,366 --> 00:07:00,755
(Disco beat on keyboard)

116
00:07:06,364 --> 00:07:07,796
Right.

117
00:07:07,883 --> 00:07:09,760
(Disco beat)

118
00:07:10,843 --> 00:07:14,437
(Monotone ) # My lovely horse
running through the...field

119
00:07:14,522 --> 00:07:15,920
# Where are you going

120
00:07:16,001 --> 00:07:19,436
# With your fetlocks blowing
in the...wind?

121
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,953
# I want to shower you
with sugar lumps

122
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,427
# And ride you over...fences

123
00:07:25,518 --> 00:07:27,986
# I want to polish your hooves
every single day

124
00:07:28,078 --> 00:07:30,989
# And bring you
to the horse...dentist

125
00:07:31,077 --> 00:07:34,352
# My lovely horse
you're a pony no...

126
00:07:34,436 --> 00:07:35,868
# More

127
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:38,344
# Running around
with a man on your back

128
00:07:38,435 --> 00:07:40,345
# Like a train in the night... #

129
00:07:40,434 --> 00:07:41,992
Wait, I can do this bit.

130
00:07:42,074 --> 00:07:44,189
# Like a train in the...night #

131
00:07:45,433 --> 00:07:48,742
Well, er, what do you
think in general?

132
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:57,028
Right.

133
00:07:59,548 --> 00:08:03,825
Father Jack's right. It's a
terrible song. What were we thinking?

134
00:08:03,907 --> 00:08:05,784
It's not that bad, Ted.

135
00:08:05,867 --> 00:08:09,256
The lyrics are fine.
There's no problem there.

136
00:08:09,346 --> 00:08:13,895
But it's a terrible tune. It's just
the same note over and over again.

137
00:08:13,984 --> 00:08:17,692
I'll put on my favourite Eurosong,
maybe that'll cheer us up.

138
00:08:17,783 --> 00:08:20,660
Yes, that might help. What is it?

139
00:08:20,742 --> 00:08:23,176
It's Nin Huugen and the Huugen Notes.

140
00:08:23,262 --> 00:08:27,173
It came fifth
in A Song For Norway in 1976.

141
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,692
(Music starts)

142
00:08:30,779 --> 00:08:33,691
(Lively tune
with Norwegian lyrics)

143
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:40,008
That's not too bad, actually.

144
00:08:40,097 --> 00:08:42,212
That's the B-side. I'll turn it over.

145
00:08:42,296 --> 00:08:46,288
- No. No, leave it. Leave it.
- It's nice enough, isn't it?

146
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:49,810
Yeah. If only we'd come up
with something like that.

147
00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:58,442
Dougal...I suppose not many people
have actually heard that song?

148
00:08:58,531 --> 00:09:01,443
Suppose not.
First time I've heard it.

149
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:08,085
Where are the band now?

150
00:09:08,169 --> 00:09:11,080
Oh, God, Ted, it's a terrible story.

151
00:09:11,168 --> 00:09:13,442
They all died in a plane crash,

152
00:09:13,527 --> 00:09:16,359
including everybody
involved in the song -

153
00:09:16,446 --> 00:09:19,994
the studio engineers,
the producer, the manager...

154
00:09:20,085 --> 00:09:22,803
- The people who owned the rights?
- Oh, yes.

155
00:09:22,884 --> 00:09:24,954
That's terrible.

156
00:09:25,044 --> 00:09:26,761
- Er, Dougal...
- Yeah?

157
00:09:26,843 --> 00:09:29,959
Wouldn't it be nice
to commemorate those people

158
00:09:30,042 --> 00:09:33,590
- by keeping their music alive?
- What?

159
00:09:33,681 --> 00:09:37,992
Suppose we were to borrow
that tune for My Lovely Horse.

160
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,990
It would help us out

161
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:43,036
and commemorate their memory
at the same time.

162
00:09:43,118 --> 00:09:45,791
So we wouldn't just
be stealing their tune?

163
00:09:45,878 --> 00:09:49,506
No! You'd have to be mad
to jump to that conclusion.

164
00:09:49,597 --> 00:09:52,747
As I say, we'd just be
celebrating their memory.

165
00:09:52,836 --> 00:09:54,154
Secretly.

166
00:09:55,635 --> 00:09:58,546
- Incidentally, don't tell anyone.
- Oh, right.

167
00:09:58,634 --> 00:10:01,545
And if the song wins
and we make any money,

168
00:10:01,633 --> 00:10:04,066
we could give it to their relatives.

169
00:10:04,152 --> 00:10:07,063
Yeah... We'll play that by ear.

170
00:10:08,991 --> 00:10:11,663
(Ted humming Huugen Notes tune )

171
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:16,777
You know, I don't want
to jump to any conclusions

172
00:10:16,869 --> 00:10:19,462
but I think
we're definitely going to win!

173
00:10:19,548 --> 00:10:21,424
Really? Oh, great.

174
00:10:21,507 --> 00:10:23,418
There'll be lots to think about.

175
00:10:23,507 --> 00:10:26,896
Promotions for journalists,
American tour dates...

176
00:10:26,986 --> 00:10:29,624
And I suppose a big
fly poster campaign.

177
00:10:29,705 --> 00:10:33,219
- And the obligatory video.
- Obligatory video - wow!

178
00:10:33,304 --> 00:10:36,613
Are priests allowed
to be rock stars, though, Ted?

179
00:10:36,703 --> 00:10:39,421
A lad at the seminary,
Father Benny Cake,

180
00:10:39,502 --> 00:10:42,891
he recorded a song
that went to number one in England.

181
00:10:42,981 --> 00:10:44,619
- Really?
- Yeah.

182
00:10:44,701 --> 00:10:48,658
He didn't want to be known
as a priest so he called himself...

183
00:10:48,739 --> 00:10:51,253
Anyway, the song was called Vienna.

184
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:55,968
Why didn't he want people
to know he was a priest?

185
00:10:56,057 --> 00:10:59,492
People thought if you
were a priest, you were uncool.

186
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:02,453
- A bit of a square.
- Then we came along.

187
00:11:02,535 --> 00:11:06,243
Yeah. Anyway, Dougal, get to sleep.
Sweet dreams.

188

# With your fetlocks

193

# I want to shower you

194
00:11:36,526 --> 00:11:40,153

199
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,511
# You're a pony no more

200

201

202
00:12:05,677 --> 00:12:07,554
# Like a train in the night #

203

(Saxophone solo )

204
00:12:13,955 --> 00:12:15,467
(Ted panting)

205
00:12:15,554 --> 00:12:17,784
We have to lose that sax solo!

206
00:12:20,553 --> 00:12:24,511
Er, Mrs Doyle, I think that's
enough make-up on Dougal now.

207
00:12:24,592 --> 00:12:27,549
There you go. Good man.

208
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,467
(knock at door)

209
00:12:33,549 --> 00:12:34,948
Hello, uh, Father Crilly.

210
00:12:35,029 --> 00:12:38,338
I'm Charles Hedges,
your producer, and this is...

211
00:12:38,428 --> 00:12:41,658
Mr Rickwood!
I'm delighted to meet you.

212
00:12:41,747 --> 00:12:43,941
You did a brilliant job last year.

213
00:12:44,026 --> 00:12:48,143
That's the business, you know, in
and out of doors, like, and giddy up!

214
00:12:49,224 --> 00:12:50,862
S-sorry?

215
00:12:50,944 --> 00:12:52,979
The business, and giddy up!

216
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:55,019
Ah, yes! Ha ha!

217
00:12:57,062 --> 00:12:58,939
(Gibberish)

218
00:13:00,021 --> 00:13:01,977
Mm. Mm. Mm.

219
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:07,048
I have to say, he sounded
a lot better on last year's show.

220
00:13:07,139 --> 00:13:09,095
Once he's on stage, he's fine.

221
00:13:09,179 --> 00:13:12,614
- Have you known him long?
- Yes. Partners for ten years.

222
00:13:12,698 --> 00:13:14,927
Running the production company?

223
00:13:15,017 --> 00:13:16,734
No, no. He's my lover.

224
00:13:21,255 --> 00:13:24,166
He... He's quite a catch.

225
00:13:27,453 --> 00:13:30,365
This is my partner,
Father Dougal McGuire.

226
00:13:30,452 --> 00:13:33,842
Not my sexual partner!
My partner I do the song with.

227
00:13:33,931 --> 00:13:36,525
- Yes, well, I'd guessed that.
- Of course.

228
00:13:36,611 --> 00:13:39,647
Not that there's anything wrong
with that type of...thing.

229
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:43,358
I thought the Church thought
it was inherently wrong.

230
00:13:43,449 --> 00:13:46,326
Ah, yes, it does.
The whole gay thing -

231
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:49,205
I suppose it's a bit
of a puzzle to us all.

232
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:52,119
It must be fun, though. Not the...

233
00:13:53,206 --> 00:13:55,594
Not the, you know,
but the nightclubs

234
00:13:55,685 --> 00:13:59,279
and the whole rough and tumble
of homosexual activity.

235
00:13:59,364 --> 00:14:01,797
Having boyfriends when you're a man.

236
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:06,160
Don't mind what the Church thinks,
it thought the earth was flat!

237
00:14:06,242 --> 00:14:09,278
Sometimes the Pope
says things he doesn't mean.

238
00:14:09,361 --> 00:14:11,556
Even the Pope gets things wrong.

239
00:14:11,641 --> 00:14:13,790
What about Papal infallibility?

240
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,232
Yes.

241
00:14:17,239 --> 00:14:20,150
Is it for everything,
the infallibility?

242
00:14:20,238 --> 00:14:22,273
I don't know.

243
00:14:22,357 --> 00:14:25,632
Right. Anyhow...
Nothing to do with me!

244
00:14:25,716 --> 00:14:28,708
I'm really looking forward
to your entry.

245
00:14:31,155 --> 00:14:34,544
The song! Ha! The song. Right.

246
00:14:34,634 --> 00:14:37,705
- Well, so am I.
- Do you think we'll win?

247
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:40,704
It's not up to him.
It's the public who decide.

248
00:14:40,792 --> 00:14:42,191
- Not this year.
- No?

249
00:14:42,272 --> 00:14:44,421
This year, I'll pick the winner.

250
00:14:44,511 --> 00:14:47,183
That old phone-in system
wasn't working.

251
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:50,705
But the song the public chose
has won five years in a row.

252
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:54,781
Yes, but it's, eh...
quite complicated.

253
00:14:54,868 --> 00:14:57,017
Are you looking forward to the show?

254
00:14:57,107 --> 00:14:59,063
Oh, yes. We're all thrilled.

255
00:14:59,147 --> 00:15:02,741
Bit of a novelty, I suppose,
what with us being priests.

256
00:15:02,826 --> 00:15:06,374
Ah, well, not exactly.
There's a similar act to yours.

257
00:15:06,465 --> 00:15:08,898
Father Byrne and Father McDuff.

258
00:15:08,984 --> 00:15:11,702
I didn't think
they'd make it this far.

259
00:15:11,783 --> 00:15:15,536
Flip! They'll win, Ted.
We might as well give up now.

260
00:15:15,622 --> 00:15:17,771
That's a very defeatist attitude!

261
00:15:17,861 --> 00:15:20,091
Oh, it is. Sorry about that.

262
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:25,453
Ah, but he's right, Ted.
Ready to be beaten, then?

263
00:15:25,539 --> 00:15:27,893
I'd say your song is terrible anyway.

264
00:15:27,978 --> 00:15:30,731
It's better than yours, ya big fool!

265
00:15:30,818 --> 00:15:32,648
Take that back!

266
00:15:32,737 --> 00:15:34,489
I'll just be leaving.

267
00:15:34,576 --> 00:15:36,646
Thanks, Charles. See you later.

268
00:15:36,736 --> 00:15:39,169
Yes, thanks.
We'll have a great time.

269
00:15:40,175 --> 00:15:44,372
I bet we get a million points
and you get minus 7,000!

270
00:15:44,454 --> 00:15:47,013
- How much do you bet?!
- Four pounds!

271
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:49,604
Right! You're on!

272
00:15:49,692 --> 00:15:54,128
That's just us winning. A million
points is a bit of an exaggeration.

273
00:15:57,410 --> 00:15:59,923
Right, we're off to win the contest.

274
00:16:01,009 --> 00:16:03,317
Ah, seriously, Ted...

275
00:16:03,408 --> 00:16:06,843
Even if you don't win,
I'm sure your song's very good.

276
00:16:06,927 --> 00:16:08,963
- Really?
- No!

277
00:16:09,046 --> 00:16:13,197
Oh, I really hate Father Dick Byrne!

278
00:16:22,403 --> 00:16:26,235
- Good luck tonight, Fred.

00:19:18,192 --> 00:19:20,386
No! They'll know we ripped it off!

315
00:19:20,471 --> 00:19:23,701
It's more famous than we thought!
Oh, we'll be found out!

316
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:25,462
What'll we do, Ted?

317
00:19:25,549 --> 00:19:28,541
What did we do to deserve this?!

318
00:19:28,629 --> 00:19:31,461
# I

319
00:19:31,548 --> 00:19:35,620
# I've nothing left but time

320
00:19:36,746 --> 00:19:39,101
# Still I reach out... #

321
00:19:39,186 --> 00:19:40,823
Song's nearly over.

322
00:19:40,905 --> 00:19:44,101
Oh, no...! I think...Dougal...

323
00:19:44,184 --> 00:19:47,539
We'll have to resort to Plan B.

324
00:19:47,623 --> 00:19:51,854
# Ahhh... #

325
00:20:04,218 --> 00:20:07,846
Wonderful! Wonderful! Something else!

326
00:20:07,937 --> 00:20:10,450
And now on to our next act.

327
00:20:10,536 --> 00:20:14,369
All the way from Craggy Island,
could you please welcome

328
00:20:14,455 --> 00:20:18,606
Father Ted Crilly
and Father Dougal McGuire!

329
00:20:18,694 --> 00:20:20,571
(Applause )

330
00:20:23,653 --> 00:20:27,088
(Monotone ) # My lovely horse
running through the...

331
00:20:27,172 --> 00:20:28,490
# Field

332
00:20:28,571 --> 00:20:31,130
# Where are you going

333
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:34,327
# With your fetlocks
blowing in the...

334
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:36,127
# Wind

335
00:20:37,009 --> 00:20:39,442
# I want to shower you
with sugar lumps

336
00:20:39,528 --> 00:20:41,041
# And ride you over...

337
00:20:41,128 --> 00:20:43,800
# Fences

338
00:20:43,887 --> 00:20:46,036
# And polish your hooves
every single day

339
00:20:46,126 --> 00:20:48,003
# And send you to the horse...

340
00:20:48,086 --> 00:20:49,882
# Dentist

341
00:20:49,965 --> 00:20:53,559
# My lovely horse
you're a pony no...

342
00:20:53,644 --> 00:20:55,395
# More

343
00:20:55,483 --> 00:20:58,395
# Running around
with a man on your back

344
00:20:58,483 --> 00:21:01,679
# Like a train in the night,
Like a train in the... #

345
00:21:01,762 --> 00:21:03,433
I can get this.

346
00:21:03,521 --> 00:21:05,476
# Night... #

347
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,711
(Silence )

348
00:21:18,717 --> 00:21:20,513
(Laughter)

349
00:21:20,596 --> 00:21:22,507
Well, we did it!

350
00:21:22,596 --> 00:21:24,950
Don't ask me how, but we did it!

351
00:21:27,474 --> 00:21:30,624
It's simple, Father -
yours was the best song.

352
00:21:30,713 --> 00:21:34,830
I suppose so. But I didn't think
the audience were going for it.

353
00:21:34,912 --> 00:21:37,869
(Gibberish)

354
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:43,984
Yeah, yeah... Cheers!

355
00:21:46,069 --> 00:21:49,663
What's going on?!
Our song was clearly miles better!

356
00:21:49,748 --> 00:21:52,136
Well, we thought...

357
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:55,218
It was the same note
over and over again!

358
00:21:55,306 --> 00:21:57,899
Yes, but we admired its erm...

359
00:21:57,985 --> 00:22:00,942
(Gibberish)

360
00:22:03,064 --> 00:22:06,419
Exactly! Fred put it better
than I ever could.

361
00:22:06,503 --> 00:22:08,060
So there!

362
00:22:08,142 --> 00:22:10,861
You'd think you wanted Ireland
to lose the Euro contest!

363
00:22:10,941 --> 00:22:12,340
(Laughs)

364
00:22:12,421 --> 00:22:14,411
(Nervous laughter)

365
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,776
Nonsense!
Why would we want to do that?!

366
00:22:17,859 --> 00:22:21,294
Maybe because it was costing you
too much to stage(!)

367
00:22:21,378 --> 00:22:24,575
Oh-oh-ho, dear, dear, dear!

368
00:22:24,658 --> 00:22:28,569
Now, come on!
Does that really sound plausible?

369
00:22:28,656 --> 00:22:33,331
Go and count your sour grapes
before...they hatch.

370
00:22:34,775 --> 00:22:36,730
Better luck next time!

371
00:22:37,294 --> 00:22:40,683
- We lost, Cyril!
- Really...?

372
00:22:40,773 --> 00:22:42,251
Come on!

373
00:22:43,332 --> 00:22:47,927
Anyway, Father, I'm sure you'll do
very well at the Eurosong Contest.

374
00:22:48,011 --> 00:22:50,763
I think we will.
Europe, here we come!

375
00:22:52,809 --> 00:22:57,677
We'd better sneak them out the
back. That's a nasty crowd out there.

376
00:23:02,007 --> 00:23:07,443
'Thank you, Athens.
That's a total of 103 for Belgium.

377
00:23:07,525 --> 00:23:12,518
'Now, could we have the points for
Ireland's entry, My Lovely Horse.'

378
00:23:12,604 --> 00:23:14,639
'Irelande, nil points.'

379
00:23:14,723 --> 00:23:16,917
'Ireland, no points.'

380
00:23:17,002 --> 00:23:18,720
'Irlanda, nada.'

381
00:23:18,802 --> 00:23:20,792
'Ireland, no points.'

382
00:23:20,881 --> 00:23:23,713
'Irlandia, meethen vathmee.'

383
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,711
'Ireland, no points.'

384
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,755
'Irlande, keine punte.'

385
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:30,069
'Ireland, no points.'

386
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,797
'Irshka, bash bodova.'

387
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:34,868
'Again, Ireland - no points.'

388
00:23:34,957 --> 00:23:37,709
'Irlandia, nurda proken.'

389
00:23:37,796 --> 00:23:40,628
'Ireland, n-nothing there again.'

390
00:23:40,715 --> 00:23:42,831
'Irlande, nil punten.'

391
00:23:42,915 --> 00:23:44,711
'Ireland, no points.'

392
00:23:44,794 --> 00:23:47,546
'Irlinia, nurda purda.'

393
00:23:47,633 --> 00:23:49,510
'That means nothing.'

394
00:23:49,593 --> 00:23:52,550
'Irlenski, nurte point lete.'

395
00:23:52,632 --> 00:23:53,860
'Nothing.'

396
00:23:54,305 --> 00:24:54,298
