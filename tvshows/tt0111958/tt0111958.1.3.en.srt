(Helicopter)

3
00:00:28,607 --> 00:00:29,801
(Crash)

4
00:00:41,407 --> 00:00:43,398
Looks like rain, Ted.

5
00:00:44,487 --> 00:00:46,478
Come on, Dougal. It's your go.

6
00:00:46,527 --> 00:00:50,407
I must say, Father Hernandez,
it's been wonderful having you over.

7
00:00:50,447 --> 00:00:52,961
But I expect you're homesick
for Cuba.

8
00:00:53,007 --> 00:00:54,884
(Speaking Spanish)

9
00:00:56,767 --> 00:01:00,331
(Translator) <i>Yes, my country
is very beautiful.</i>

10
00:01:01,007 --> 00:01:03,157
(Speaking Spanish)

11
00:01:03,207 --> 00:01:08,725
<i>But Ted, you have a great life
here on Craggy Island.</i>

12
00:01:08,767 --> 00:01:10,945
<i>You have two good friends.</i>

13
00:01:11,807 --> 00:01:13,193
<i>Father Dougal…</i>

14
00:01:14,807 --> 00:01:17,117
<i>And, of course, Father Jack.</i>

15
00:01:17,167 --> 00:01:20,955
Yes, but I must say,
I miss the noise and the lights

16
00:01:21,007 --> 00:01:23,601
and the whole buzz of the big city.

17
00:01:25,167 --> 00:01:28,398
<i>You were in Wexford, weren't you?</i>

18
00:01:30,327 --> 00:01:33,364
I was, yes.
But Craggy Island has its charms.

19
00:01:33,407 --> 00:01:37,127
The west part of the island was
beautiful. Until it drifted off.

20
00:01:37,167 --> 00:01:39,761
<i>Drifted off?</i>

21
00:01:39,807 --> 00:01:42,527
Yes, there was a storm
and it just came loose.

22
00:01:42,567 --> 00:01:46,207
Now we don't have a west side,
just north, south and east.

23
00:01:46,247 --> 00:01:47,839
But it was lovely.

24
00:01:48,887 --> 00:01:50,605
<i>You know, Ted…</i>

25
00:01:50,647 --> 00:01:55,277
<i>Your housekeeper is a…
very beautiful woman.</i>

26
00:01:58,927 --> 00:02:02,237
<i>Sometimes this celibacy
is hard for a man.</i>

27
00:02:05,727 --> 00:02:07,479
<i>Heh, heh, heh.</i>

28
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:11,127
Yes, well, you have to take
the rough with the smooth, I suppose.

29
00:02:11,167 --> 00:02:14,477
–Bishop Brennan springs to mind.
<i>–Oh, yes?</i>

30
00:02:14,527 --> 00:02:18,156
Yes, Bishop Len Brennan.
He's our kind of boss.

31
00:02:18,207 --> 00:02:20,198
Apparently, he was, uh…

32
00:02:21,407 --> 00:02:23,079
at the old…

33
00:02:23,967 --> 00:02:25,320
himself.

34
00:02:25,367 --> 00:02:27,722
The union was blessed, so they say.

35
00:02:27,767 --> 00:02:29,917
<i>No.</i>

36
00:02:31,087 --> 00:02:34,327
A son. He lives in America.
Or so goes the rumour.

37
00:02:34,367 --> 00:02:40,761
Was it Colonel Mustard in the kitchen
with… the candlestick?

38
00:02:40,807 --> 00:02:42,035
What?

39
00:02:43,047 --> 00:02:46,247
Colonel Mustard in the kitchen
with the candlestick.

40
00:02:46,287 --> 00:02:49,287
You have Colonel Mustard.
You showed me earlier.

41
00:02:49,327 --> 00:02:51,327
How could it be him if you have him?

42
00:02:51,367 --> 00:02:53,039
Oh, right.

43
00:02:54,967 --> 00:02:56,764
Father Hernandez, your go.

44
00:02:56,807 --> 00:03:01,198
<i>Yes. I think it was…</i>

45
00:03:03,407 --> 00:03:06,160
<i>The Reverend Green…</i>

46
00:03:06,207 --> 00:03:09,404
<i>with the knife…
in the drawing room.</i>

47
00:03:09,447 --> 00:03:13,281
(Chuckling) Those Protestants.
Up to no good as usual.

48
00:03:14,687 --> 00:03:18,447
What's Father Jack looking at?
What's that you're watching?

49
00:03:18,487 --> 00:03:20,637
–What?
–Is that a film?

50
00:03:20,687 --> 00:03:23,007
–What?
–Isn't that Kiefer Sutherland?

51
00:03:23,047 --> 00:03:25,959
–What?
–Is that Flatliners you're watching?

52
00:03:26,007 --> 00:03:28,202
What?

53
00:03:28,247 --> 00:03:30,927
<i>Is Father Jack
a little hard of hearing?</i>

54
00:03:30,967 --> 00:03:32,605
What?

55
00:03:32,647 --> 00:03:35,881
Yes, he gets a kind of waxy build-up
in his ears.

56
00:03:35,927 --> 00:03:38,967
Then we have to syringe them.
It's not very nice.

57
00:03:39,007 --> 00:03:42,047
It's great,
because we're never short of candles.

58
00:03:42,087 --> 00:03:43,315
(Jack) What?

59
00:03:46,287 --> 00:03:49,438
All that was in his head last week.

60
00:03:51,487 --> 00:03:54,285
And there's a few more over there.

61
00:03:54,327 --> 00:03:56,847
We've nearly enough
for a papal funeral.

62
00:03:56,887 --> 00:04:00,517
He's a one-man candle factory.
Aren't you, Father Jack?

63
00:04:00,527 --> 00:04:01,721
What?

64
00:04:01,767 --> 00:04:04,767
To be honest, he can hear well enough
when he wants to.

65
00:04:04,807 --> 00:04:06,126
Watch this.

66
00:04:06,167 --> 00:04:09,007
Father Jack,
would you like a glass of brandy?

67
00:04:09,047 --> 00:04:10,275
Yes.

68
00:04:12,007 --> 00:04:14,237
Oh, you see, he's a terrible man.

69
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:15,686
Brandy! Brandy!

70
00:04:15,727 --> 00:04:19,242
All right, all right. Now, say when.

71
00:04:19,287 --> 00:04:20,766
–What?
–Say when.

72
00:04:20,807 --> 00:04:23,127
–What?
–Tell me when to stop pouring.

73
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:25,203
Oh, right, you want any more?

74
00:04:25,247 --> 00:04:27,397
–Yes. Yes, yes.
–(Phone )

75
00:04:28,407 --> 00:04:32,407
Hello! Craggy Island parochial house,
Father Ted Crilly speaking.

76
00:04:32,447 --> 00:04:34,915
Hello, Bishop Brennan. How are you?

77
00:04:34,967 --> 00:04:39,324
Yes. No. Ah, right. Good, yes.
All right, of course, yes. Goodbye.

78
00:04:40,367 --> 00:04:44,247
The boss is coming over. He wants
to talk to us about something.

79
00:04:44,287 --> 00:04:47,967
Come on. This is the longest
game of Cluedo I've ever played.

80
00:04:48,007 --> 00:04:50,515
How long are we at it now?
Five hours?

81
00:04:51,727 --> 00:04:55,159
Should there not be some cards
in here or something?

82
00:04:59,407 --> 00:05:00,726
Dougal.

83
00:05:02,887 --> 00:05:04,320
Ted.

84
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:09,920
<i>Again, I have no words to say
how thankful I am.</i>

85
00:05:10,967 --> 00:05:12,958
That's a bit ungrateful, Ted.

86
00:05:13,007 --> 00:05:15,087
Don't you worry, Father Hernandez.

87
00:05:15,127 --> 00:05:20,121
<i>However, I do have some gifts
from the people of my village.</i>

88
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:26,173
<i>Please, do not laugh at this simple
example of Cuban handicraft.</i>

89
00:05:27,367 --> 00:05:29,005
It's a video recorder!

90
00:05:30,487 --> 00:05:34,196
<i>Yes, I'm sorry.
It's a very basic model.</i>

91
00:05:34,247 --> 00:05:37,007
<i>It has only a three-week
pre-record facility.</i>

92
00:05:37,047 --> 00:05:39,481
Don't worry about that. It's great!

93
00:05:39,527 --> 00:05:41,757
Thanks very much. It's wonderful.

94
00:05:44,007 --> 00:05:49,286
<i>And for you, Ted,
I have something… very special.</i>

95
00:05:52,807 --> 00:05:54,206
Oh.

96
00:05:57,927 --> 00:05:59,645
You really shouldn't have.

97
00:06:03,687 --> 00:06:05,917
You really shouldn't have.

98
00:06:07,407 --> 00:06:09,915
<i>It is a Cuban fertility symbol.</i>

99
00:06:10,807 --> 00:06:15,198
<i>I hope it brings you
as much luck as it brought me.</i>

100
00:06:15,247 --> 00:06:19,286
<i>Yes? Eh? Eh, my friend?</i>

101
00:06:21,207 --> 00:06:22,879
<i>Well…</i>

102
00:06:22,927 --> 00:06:25,043
Adios, Ted!

103
00:06:25,087 --> 00:06:27,157
(Booming dance music from car)

104
00:06:31,287 --> 00:06:34,167
Come on, Dougal,
the Bishop will be here soon.

105
00:06:34,207 --> 00:06:36,926
–Do you remember what I told you?
–Huh?

106
00:06:37,927 --> 00:06:41,807
It's very simple. Don't mention
what we talked about last night.

107
00:06:41,847 --> 00:06:43,644
Oh, right, yeah.

108
00:06:44,607 --> 00:06:47,207
What were we talking about
last night, Ted?

109
00:06:47,247 --> 00:06:50,087
You know,
about the Bishop's little mistake.

110
00:06:50,127 --> 00:06:51,765
Oh, right, yeah.

111
00:06:52,807 --> 00:06:55,116
What mistake was that, now, Ted?

112
00:06:55,167 --> 00:06:58,398
–His son. His son in America.
–Oh, yes.

113
00:06:59,447 --> 00:07:02,484
He has a son? In America?

114
00:07:03,527 --> 00:07:07,566
–Yes, well, so they say.
–Right. That's news to me, Ted.

115
00:07:11,807 --> 00:07:15,767
We were talking about it last night,
Dougal. To Father Hernandez.

116
00:07:15,807 --> 00:07:17,126
Who?

117
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:22,013
Oh, right, the Cuban lad. Yeah.
He gave us a video.

118
00:07:23,807 --> 00:07:26,051
–The Bishop, remember?
–Right, OK.

119
00:07:26,087 --> 00:07:29,247
Just forget all about it.
Just do not mention the son.

120
00:07:29,287 --> 00:07:31,517
–Have you got that?
–I have, Ted.

121
00:07:31,567 --> 00:07:34,405
The lights are on,
but there's nobody home.

122
00:07:36,367 --> 00:07:39,040
Father Crilly, Bishop Brennan's here.

123
00:07:39,087 --> 00:07:41,265
Hell's bells! Right, show him in.

124
00:07:41,287 --> 00:07:43,039
Not a word about the son.

125
00:07:45,607 --> 00:07:49,122
Hello, Bishop, how are you?
Come on in, sit down.

126
00:07:49,167 --> 00:07:52,287
Sit down there, Your Grace,
beside Father Dougal.

127
00:07:52,327 --> 00:07:54,397
Mrs Doyle? Some tea, please.

128
00:07:54,447 --> 00:07:56,438
Oh, certainly, Father Crilly.

129
00:08:27,407 --> 00:08:28,806
How's the son?

130
00:08:29,727 --> 00:08:31,399
–What⁈
–The Son of God!

131
00:08:31,447 --> 00:08:34,405
How's everything
in the world of religion?

132
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:37,567
The world of religion? What the hell
are you talking about?

133
00:08:37,607 --> 00:08:40,246
Well, you know. Mrs Doyle, that tea?

134
00:08:40,287 --> 00:08:42,323
Here I am. Here I am.

135
00:08:42,367 --> 00:08:43,925
Oh, isn't this grand?

136
00:08:43,967 --> 00:08:45,847
I'm fine, thank you, Mrs Doyle.

137
00:08:45,887 --> 00:08:48,447
Will you not have a cup of tea,
Bishop Brennan?

138
00:08:48,487 --> 00:08:52,127
No, I want to get right to the point
and get the hell out of here.

139
00:08:52,167 --> 00:08:54,807
–Sure you won't have a cup?
–I'm certain.

140
00:08:54,847 --> 00:08:57,441
–Go on, have a cup.
–No, thank you.

141
00:08:57,487 --> 00:08:59,637
Everybody else is having a cup.

142
00:08:59,687 --> 00:09:02,918
–I do not have time. Now…
–You'll feel left out.

143
00:09:02,967 --> 00:09:05,481
You'll be Bishop Piggy-in-the-Middle.

144
00:09:05,527 --> 00:09:06,801
I am fine!

145
00:09:06,847 --> 00:09:09,281
–Are you sure? Just a drop.
–No!

146
00:09:11,247 --> 00:09:13,966
♫ Bishop Piggy-in-the-Middle! ♫

147
00:09:14,007 --> 00:09:16,840
Just say yes, Your Grace.
It's quicker.

148
00:09:16,887 --> 00:09:19,879
–All right, then, yes.
–Ah, grand. So, now.

149
00:09:22,487 --> 00:09:25,047
I hope you're not doing
too much damage here.

150
00:09:25,087 --> 00:09:28,284
Jack? Are you behaving yourself?

151
00:09:28,327 --> 00:09:31,797
–Feck off.
–What did you say?

152
00:09:31,847 --> 00:09:35,687
Your Grace, what brings you here?
Sending us back to our parishes?

153
00:09:35,727 --> 00:09:39,242
Fat chance. You're here
until I tell you otherwise.

154
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:42,836
Do you think I'd let Jack
back into a normal parish

155
00:09:42,887 --> 00:09:45,355
after the wedding he did in Athalong?

156
00:09:46,327 --> 00:09:49,285
–Yes, but surely I'm all right.
–No, no, no.

157
00:09:49,327 --> 00:09:52,607
You are here until all of that money
is accounted for.

158
00:09:52,647 --> 00:09:55,764
–I don't know what happened to it!
–Enough!

159
00:09:55,807 --> 00:09:57,638
You went to Las Vegas,

160
00:09:57,687 --> 00:10:01,282
whilst that poor child
was supposed to be in Lourdes.

161
00:10:03,487 --> 00:10:06,524
And as for this… cabbage!

162
00:10:07,767 --> 00:10:10,727
The mere idea of letting him back
into the real world

163
00:10:10,767 --> 00:10:12,837
after the black rock incident.

164
00:10:12,887 --> 00:10:16,327
–Yes, that was unfortunate.
–Lives irreparably damaged!

165
00:10:16,367 --> 00:10:18,198
They were only nuns.

166
00:10:19,247 --> 00:10:21,124
Nuns are people, too.

167
00:10:21,167 --> 00:10:24,327
My God, the strings I pulled
to not involve the Vatican.

168
00:10:24,367 --> 00:10:26,167
I do not want to talk about it!

169
00:10:26,207 --> 00:10:28,567
I just want this film business
over with.

170
00:10:28,607 --> 00:10:30,120
Film? What film?

171
00:10:30,167 --> 00:10:34,001
This blasphemous film,
The Passion of Saint Tibulus.

172
00:10:34,047 --> 00:10:36,087
Now, His Holiness has banned it.

173
00:10:36,127 --> 00:10:39,447
But a loophole means the bloody
thing's showing in this dump.

174
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:41,727
Oh, yes.
Is it any good, do you know?

175
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:44,565
I don't care if it's any good or not.

176
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:48,407
All I know is we have to be seen
to be making a stand against it.

177
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:52,967
I have been brought back from my
holiday in California to sort it out.

178
00:10:53,007 --> 00:10:55,927
And that's where you
and Larry and Moe come in.

179
00:10:55,967 --> 00:10:58,003
What do you mean?

180
00:10:58,047 --> 00:11:02,802
Well, I know that you couldn't
organise a nun shoot in a nunnery.

181
00:11:02,847 --> 00:11:06,847
But despite that, it's up to you
to make the Church's position clear.

182
00:11:06,887 --> 00:11:10,880
Make a protest at the cinema!
Even you can manage that.

183
00:11:10,927 --> 00:11:12,724
Well, thanks very much.

184
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:16,247
Listen, this is very serious.
Don't make a balls of it.

185
00:11:16,287 --> 00:11:17,686
I'll be in touch.

186
00:11:17,727 --> 00:11:20,958
Your Grace.
This isn't really my area.

187
00:11:21,007 --> 00:11:24,841
Nothing is your area, Crilly.
You do not have an area.

188
00:11:24,887 --> 00:11:29,367
Unless it's a kind of a play area,
with sandcastles, buckets and spades!

189
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:31,967
Now, do what you're told, right?

190
00:11:35,047 --> 00:11:37,038
Bye, now!

191
00:11:39,967 --> 00:11:43,201
Look at this. This is silly.
There's nobody here!

192
00:11:43,247 --> 00:11:45,238
Ladies and gentlemen,

193
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:49,678
we have a treat in store today
for all ye fans of French cinema.

194
00:11:49,727 --> 00:11:51,604
–Is it subtitled?
–Pardon?

195
00:11:51,647 --> 00:11:54,480
Is it subtitled or is it dubbed?

196
00:11:54,527 --> 00:11:55,721
It's subtitled.

197
00:11:55,767 --> 00:11:58,076
Ah, Jesus.

198
00:11:59,727 --> 00:12:01,971
Shall we start the protesting now?

199
00:12:02,007 --> 00:12:03,235
Yes, I suppose so.

200
00:12:03,287 --> 00:12:05,967
Or maybe we should
see a bit of the film first.

201
00:12:06,007 --> 00:12:07,887
No, let's just get it over with.

202
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:11,607
Maybe it's not too bad, Ted.
It could be another Commitments.

203
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:15,967
It doesn't matter, good or bad. It's
the morality we don't agree with.

204
00:12:16,007 --> 00:12:17,838
Right, let's go.

205
00:12:17,887 --> 00:12:19,764
Boo! Boo!

206
00:12:19,807 --> 00:12:21,923
–(Barks )
–Ooh, you bad pup!

207
00:12:21,967 --> 00:12:23,639
Who is that?

208
00:12:23,687 --> 00:12:25,535
–Dirty, filthy beggar.
–Boo.

209
00:12:25,567 --> 00:12:27,717
–Look, you…
–Boo.

210
00:12:28,767 --> 00:12:31,759
Father Ted, Father Dougal!
'Tis yourselves!

211
00:12:31,807 --> 00:12:32,922
Hello, Michael.

212
00:12:32,967 --> 00:12:34,881
–How are you?
–Oh, I'm grand.

213
00:12:34,927 --> 00:12:39,167
How's Father Jack? We haven't seen
him since the Sharon Stone season.

214
00:12:39,207 --> 00:12:42,127
He's grand. A bit tired,
so he won't be along today.

215
00:12:42,167 --> 00:12:44,247
Oh, you're making a fierce racket.

216
00:12:44,287 --> 00:12:45,606
It's a long story.

217
00:12:45,647 --> 00:12:48,567
We have the Bishop over,
you know, Len Brennan.

218
00:12:48,607 --> 00:12:50,757
Oh, that gobshite.

219
00:12:50,807 --> 00:12:52,767
Yes, he's gone mad over the film.

220
00:12:52,807 --> 00:12:54,927
He told us
to kick up a bit of a fuss.

221
00:12:54,967 --> 00:12:57,007
Oh, right. Only one thing, though.

222
00:12:57,047 --> 00:13:00,164
You're sort of, uh…
disrupting the show.

223
00:13:00,207 --> 00:13:03,483
We're not, are we?
Awfully sorry, Michael.

224
00:13:03,527 --> 00:13:07,289
Oh, no. No trouble at all.
But if you could keep it down.

225
00:13:07,327 --> 00:13:10,763
I mean,
we have to think of other people.

226
00:13:10,807 --> 00:13:12,763
–No problem.
–Count on us.

227
00:13:13,767 --> 00:13:15,405
Michael, Michael. Um…

228
00:13:15,447 --> 00:13:18,247
I don't suppose you…
You could throw us out?

229
00:13:18,287 --> 00:13:21,040
–Just for the television.
–No problem.

230
00:13:21,087 --> 00:13:22,566
Do you want to go now?

231
00:13:22,607 --> 00:13:25,767
Actually, we might as well stay
and see the film first.

232
00:13:25,807 --> 00:13:28,167
So I'll… throw ye out
after the film.

233
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:29,845
Grand, grand.

234
00:13:29,887 --> 00:13:33,004
And we're still OK
for the, um… half price?

235
00:13:33,047 --> 00:13:36,084
No problem. Enjoy the film.

236
00:13:38,367 --> 00:13:40,358
–Boo!
–Now, you!

237
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,642
What was all that about?

238
00:13:48,687 --> 00:13:51,520
You're asking the wrong person
there, Ted.

239
00:13:51,567 --> 00:13:53,943
I couldn't make head nor tail of it.

240
00:13:54,847 --> 00:13:58,247
I know for a fact Saint Tibulus
wore more clothes than that.

241
00:13:58,287 --> 00:14:02,181
He was from Norway or somewhere.
He'd have frozen to death!

242
00:14:03,207 --> 00:14:07,678
And when Saint Tibulus tried to take
that banana off the other lad?

243
00:14:07,727 --> 00:14:10,195
That wasn't a banana, Dougal.

244
00:14:11,727 --> 00:14:13,718
Anyway, let's get some sleep.

245
00:14:16,807 --> 00:14:22,757
(Dougal) Give us a B, please, Bob…
Beethoven.

246
00:14:22,807 --> 00:14:26,561
Give us a C, please, Bob…
Carnivorous.

247
00:14:28,087 --> 00:14:31,124
–F, please, Bob.
–Oh, God.

248
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:33,362
Not Blockbusters again!

249
00:14:33,407 --> 00:14:34,999
(Dougal) Fettucine.

250
00:14:35,047 --> 00:14:36,480
(Birds chirping)

251
00:14:36,527 --> 00:14:40,805
6am. Great!
Another eight hours' sleep.

252
00:14:44,567 --> 00:14:46,285
You awake, Ted?

253
00:14:46,327 --> 00:14:49,478
–Huh?
–This is fantastic, isn't it?

254
00:14:49,527 --> 00:14:52,963
–Another great lie-in for the lads.
–It is.

255
00:14:53,007 --> 00:14:55,521
Do you know what would be terrible?

256
00:14:55,567 --> 00:14:59,924
If Bishop Brennan told us to
go to the cinema and protest again.

257
00:14:59,967 --> 00:15:01,195
(Thunderclap )

258
00:15:07,607 --> 00:15:09,040
This is ridiculous.

259
00:15:09,087 --> 00:15:12,647
The flipping place doesn't open
for another seven hours.

260
00:15:12,687 --> 00:15:16,607
Now, didn't the Bishop want us
to chain ourselves to the railings?

261
00:15:16,647 --> 00:15:18,447
How are we supposed to do that?

262
00:15:18,487 --> 00:15:20,637
O'Learys might have something.

263
00:15:20,687 --> 00:15:22,643
Right, you go get something.

264
00:15:22,687 --> 00:15:26,887
I'll guard a closed cinema against
anyone wanting to watch a film

265
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:29,282
that doesn't start for seven hours.

266
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:36,607
Jack! What the hell are you up to?
Why aren't you at the film?

267
00:15:36,647 --> 00:15:38,080
Feck off!

268
00:15:38,127 --> 00:15:41,119
What? What did you say?

269
00:15:44,407 --> 00:15:48,400
Listen, did you see my bag anywhere,
my travelling bag, hm?

270
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:51,996
Well, if you do see it,
would you give it back to me?

271
00:15:52,047 --> 00:15:54,925
It's got my bloody passport in it,
and uh…

272
00:15:54,967 --> 00:15:56,764
everything.

273
00:15:58,247 --> 00:15:59,726
Right.

274
00:16:01,767 --> 00:16:03,564
(Mumbling)

275
00:16:24,087 --> 00:16:26,078
( # Hallelujah Chorus )

276
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:33,407
Are you gonna stand there all day,
you fat old bitch?

277
00:16:33,447 --> 00:16:36,757
Don't talk to me like that,
you big pile of shite.

278
00:16:38,007 --> 00:16:39,804
You ignorant prick!

279
00:16:39,847 --> 00:16:42,685
–You watch your mouth!
–I'll watch nothing!

280
00:16:42,727 --> 00:16:44,367
I'll stick this up your ass!

281
00:16:44,407 --> 00:16:47,240
Ah, Father Dougal.

282
00:16:47,287 --> 00:16:48,402
Hello, you two.

283
00:16:48,447 --> 00:16:52,007
–Father, how's tricks?
–We haven't seen you in a while.

284
00:16:52,047 --> 00:16:54,807
We were just making tea.
Will you have a drop?

285
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:57,281
No, thanks, Mrs O'Leary, I'm fine.

286
00:16:57,327 --> 00:16:59,687
Well, what can we do you for, Father?

287
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:02,631
Well, I was looking for
a pair of handcuffs.

288
00:17:03,887 --> 00:17:06,887
A pair of handcuffs?
What do you need them for?

289
00:17:06,927 --> 00:17:09,087
Nothing much.
They're for me and Ted.

290
00:17:09,127 --> 00:17:11,436
You and Father Ted?

291
00:17:11,487 --> 00:17:14,047
Yeah.
We're just trying something out.

292
00:17:14,087 --> 00:17:17,363
Well, actually, funny enough,
we do have a pair.

293
00:17:17,407 --> 00:17:20,167
Sergeant Thornton left them
when he retired.

294
00:17:20,207 --> 00:17:21,765
Retired from what?

295
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:23,286
From the police.

296
00:17:23,327 --> 00:17:26,683
The police?
Was Sergeant Thornton a policeman?

297
00:17:27,727 --> 00:17:29,638
Um… he was, yes.

298
00:17:29,687 --> 00:17:32,087
Why do you think he wore the uniform?

299
00:17:32,127 --> 00:17:34,327
I thought he was just
having a laugh.

300
00:17:34,367 --> 00:17:37,723
Anyway, here's the handcuffs.

301
00:17:37,767 --> 00:17:40,406
OK, thanks, great, great. Bye, now!

302
00:17:40,447 --> 00:17:41,766
Bye, Father!

303
00:17:41,807 --> 00:17:44,607
–Down with this sort of thing!
–Careful, now.

304
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:47,887
–Down with this sort of thing!
–Hello, Father Crilly.

305
00:17:47,927 --> 00:17:49,599
–Hello, Jim.
–Hello.

306
00:17:49,647 --> 00:17:51,767
I seen your picture in the paper.

307
00:17:51,807 --> 00:17:53,525
–What?
–Here, have a look!

308
00:17:53,567 --> 00:17:56,001
(Ted) Look at you!

309
00:17:56,047 --> 00:17:58,515
So it's a blasphemous film, is it?

310
00:17:58,567 --> 00:18:00,927
–Oh, it is.
–What type of thing is it?

311
00:18:00,967 --> 00:18:03,887
–Mad stuff.
–Very immoral. You wouldn't like it.

312
00:18:03,927 --> 00:18:06,441
Is it a type of nudie thing, Father?

313
00:18:06,487 --> 00:18:09,287
You wouldn't believe
the amount of nudity in it.

314
00:18:09,327 --> 00:18:12,767
Do you see the lot, do you,
or is it just the top half you see?

315
00:18:12,807 --> 00:18:16,516
–Nothing is left to the imagination.
–Right.

316
00:18:16,567 --> 00:18:19,320
–Well, I'll be off.
–Goodbye, Jim!

317
00:18:20,927 --> 00:18:24,317
–Hello, Fathers.
–Hello Mrs Sheridan, Mrs Glynn.

318
00:18:24,367 --> 00:18:26,927
The Passion of Saint Tibulus,
what's that?

319
00:18:26,967 --> 00:18:30,642
–We always go on Tuesdays.

320
00:18:30,687 --> 00:18:32,279
Oh, we saw a great one.

321
00:18:32,327 --> 00:18:34,761
–The Crying Game.
–It was brilliant!

322
00:18:34,807 --> 00:18:36,407
There was this great bit.

323
00:18:36,447 --> 00:18:40,486
There was this girl,
then you find out it's really a man!

324
00:18:40,527 --> 00:18:42,916
–They got his lad out.
–What?

325
00:18:42,967 --> 00:18:46,007
You only see it for a second
but you get the message.

326
00:18:46,047 --> 00:18:49,327
I didn't know what it was,
it's so long since I've seen one.

327
00:18:49,367 --> 00:18:51,085
It was like your Billy's!

328
00:18:51,127 --> 00:18:54,563
Not at all.
Billy's is rounder at the top.

329
00:18:54,607 --> 00:18:56,643
Cheerio, Fathers.

330
00:18:58,407 --> 00:19:00,647
Should we be stopping them going in?

331
00:19:00,687 --> 00:19:04,007
Just goes to show,
nobody heeds what the Church says.

332
00:19:04,047 --> 00:19:06,800
–Hello, Pat.
–Father Crilly. Hello.

333
00:19:06,847 --> 00:19:08,927
How's your wife? I hear she's unwell.

334
00:19:08,967 --> 00:19:10,764
She's dead, Father.

335
00:19:10,807 --> 00:19:13,241
That's terrible. When did she…?

336
00:19:13,287 --> 00:19:16,279
–Ah, just a couple of hours ago.
–Really?

337
00:19:16,327 --> 00:19:17,726
Yes.

338
00:19:17,767 --> 00:19:20,759
Anyway, that's just the way it is.

339
00:19:20,807 --> 00:19:23,685
–What's the film like, Father?
–What?

340
00:19:23,727 --> 00:19:26,647
Is it any good?
I was reading about it in the paper.

341
00:19:26,687 --> 00:19:29,967
You shouldn't think about the film
if your wife just died.

342
00:19:30,007 --> 00:19:31,998
I might wander in.

343
00:19:34,127 --> 00:19:37,361
I'll contact you
about the funeral details later.

344
00:19:37,407 --> 00:19:41,320
Good Fathers, I must say,
this is extraordinary.

345
00:19:41,367 --> 00:19:43,927
Our most successful film
since Jurassic Park!

346
00:19:43,967 --> 00:19:48,597
It's breaking records, due to all
this publicity over your protest.

347
00:19:48,647 --> 00:19:50,327
We didn't plan it that way.

348
00:19:50,367 --> 00:19:52,198
Oh, my God. Look who it is!

349
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:58,887
Thank God, a bit of support.
Fair play to you for turning…

350
00:19:58,927 --> 00:20:02,623
Come on, Father. I'll get you a seat
right at the front!

351
00:20:04,607 --> 00:20:07,838
Right, Dougal. I've had enough.
We're leaving.

352
00:20:07,887 --> 00:20:09,764
Give me the keys.

353
00:20:11,807 --> 00:20:13,604
Keys?

354
00:20:18,167 --> 00:20:19,967
What's this, then, Your Grace?

355
00:20:20,007 --> 00:20:22,567
Why am I looking at
a globe of the world?

356
00:20:22,607 --> 00:20:24,438
Well, how can I explain?

357
00:20:24,487 --> 00:20:28,526
Firstly, a resumé
of the last few days.

358
00:20:28,567 --> 00:20:31,647
Now, I don't know if you remember,
but I came in here

359
00:20:31,687 --> 00:20:35,527
with the idea of you making
a dignified protest about this film.

360
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:37,687
–Do you remember that?
–Yes, yes.

361
00:20:37,727 --> 00:20:40,487
Just to show the Church's opposition
to the film.

362
00:20:40,527 --> 00:20:44,884
But —and this is the part that
I find most interesting —

363
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:49,762
you've actually made this film the
most successful film ever shown here.

364
00:20:49,807 --> 00:20:52,116
–Isn't that great?
–Um…

365
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:55,927
I mean, people are coming from all
over the country to see the film!

366
00:20:55,967 --> 00:20:59,323
They're even coming from Gdansk
to see the film.

367
00:20:59,367 --> 00:21:01,642
And look at this! Look!

368
00:21:01,687 --> 00:21:03,887
There's you, there's Forrest Gump,

369
00:21:03,927 --> 00:21:08,079
and there's Father Jack
actually watching the film!

370
00:21:08,127 --> 00:21:10,887
Now, there's a turn-up
for the books, what?

371
00:21:10,927 --> 00:21:13,521
(Laughing) Right! Now…

372
00:21:13,567 --> 00:21:17,007
I think it's best for ye three
to continue your careers

373
00:21:17,047 --> 00:21:20,809
as priests-cum-film promoters
outside of my jurisdiction.

374
00:21:20,847 --> 00:21:22,439
Huh? Now, Ted…

375
00:21:22,487 --> 00:21:25,919
I thought that you
might like to go to America, hmm?

376
00:21:25,927 --> 00:21:27,599
What part, do you think?

377
00:21:27,647 --> 00:21:30,320
Well, um… Las Vegas?

378
00:21:31,247 --> 00:21:34,239
Oh, I'm sorry, Ted.
I meant South America.

379
00:21:34,287 --> 00:21:38,485
There's a lovely little island
off the coast of Surinam and…

380
00:21:38,527 --> 00:21:40,119
(Laughing)

381
00:21:40,167 --> 00:21:44,047
They have a couple of tribes there,
you're going to love this.

382
00:21:44,087 --> 00:21:48,127
And they have been knocking the shit
out of each other since 1907.

383
00:21:48,167 --> 00:21:50,477
And we've never found the right man

384
00:21:50,527 --> 00:21:54,520
to bring them together
in the spirit of Christian harmony.

385
00:21:54,567 --> 00:21:56,956
But I think that you are the man.

386
00:21:57,007 --> 00:21:59,383
–Well, thanks…
–No need to thank me.

387
00:21:59,407 --> 00:22:02,638
By the way,
do you know how to make arrows?

388
00:22:02,687 --> 00:22:06,077
–No.
–Not to worry. It'll come to you.

389
00:22:06,127 --> 00:22:08,322
Now, Dougal, over to you.

390
00:22:08,367 --> 00:22:12,326
Isn't it funny how some of these
places in the Philippines

391
00:22:12,367 --> 00:22:15,287
can keep going
without a proper sewerage system?

392
00:22:15,327 --> 00:22:17,505
–Hmm?
–You're right, Your Honour.

393
00:22:17,527 --> 00:22:19,961
Now, Jack, where can we send you?

394
00:22:20,007 --> 00:22:21,804
Huh? Jack, wake up.

395
00:22:21,847 --> 00:22:25,760
–Bishop, I wouldn't do that.
–You shut up. Jack! Wake up!

396
00:22:26,327 --> 00:22:27,919
Feck off!

397
00:22:29,407 --> 00:22:31,807
I've got you now, Jack! I've got you!

398
00:22:31,847 --> 00:22:36,637
Oh, my God. If you think this is bad,
wait till you see your new parish!

399
00:22:36,687 --> 00:22:38,917
Just wait until you see!

400
00:22:40,447 --> 00:22:43,007
Well, that's it, then.

401
00:22:43,047 --> 00:22:46,437
I suppose…
I suppose all we can do now is pack.

402
00:22:47,527 --> 00:22:50,047
Ted, I don't want to go
to the Philippines.

403
00:22:50,087 --> 00:22:52,397
I can't even spell the Philippines.

404
00:22:52,407 --> 00:22:54,447
I know it begins with an “F” but…

405
00:22:54,487 --> 00:22:58,167
I know. If only we could persuade
the Bishop to change his mind.

406
00:22:58,207 --> 00:23:02,233
If only we had something
we could bargain with. I don't know.

407
00:23:04,087 --> 00:23:06,527
(Ted) What's that?
Did you get a film?

408
00:23:06,567 --> 00:23:09,273
The last thing I want to watch
is a film.

409
00:23:15,887 --> 00:23:17,843
<i>Shut that thing off.</i>

410
00:23:20,207 --> 00:23:21,720
♫ Here I come ♫

411
00:23:34,207 --> 00:23:37,597
Well. That was great, wasn't it?

412
00:23:37,647 --> 00:23:39,797
You're right there, Ted.

413
00:23:39,847 --> 00:23:44,079
Should we phone him now
or will we watch it again?

414
00:23:44,127 --> 00:23:46,436
I think we'll watch it again.

414
00:23:47,305 --> 00:24:47,490
