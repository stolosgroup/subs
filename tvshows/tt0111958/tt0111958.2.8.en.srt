00:00:37,418 --> 00:00:39,487
(Mozart: Requiem ) # Rex!

3
00:00:42,655 --> 00:00:44,485
# Rex!

4
00:00:47,533 --> 00:00:48,885
# Rex! #

5
00:00:50,291 --> 00:00:52,758
(Mrs Doyle humming off-key )

6
00:00:55,488 --> 00:00:57,955
Ah, Father.
I see you put up the old cross.

7
00:00:58,047 --> 00:00:59,525
What's that all about?

8
00:00:59,606 --> 00:01:03,040
People may be confused about
where the parochial house is.

9
00:01:03,124 --> 00:01:05,796
So I put a big cross up
in the garden.

10
00:01:05,883 --> 00:01:09,191
I hope they know it means
I'm a priest and not some madman.

11
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,109
Some madman's put up a cross.

12
00:01:14,358 --> 00:01:15,676
Lovely.

13
00:01:21,594 --> 00:01:24,346
- Ted, I'm off rollerblading.
- All right, Dougal.

14
00:01:24,433 --> 00:01:26,309
(Phone )

15
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:32,264
Hello, Craggy Island parochial house.
Father Ted Crilly.

16
00:01:32,348 --> 00:01:35,703
- Hello, Ted. Dick Byrne here.
- Oh. Dick.

17
00:01:35,787 --> 00:01:39,016
I thought I'd wish you
all the best for Lent this year.

18
00:01:39,105 --> 00:01:42,175
What? Oh, yeah, Lent.
What are you giving up?

19
00:01:42,263 --> 00:01:45,458
Being the biggest eejit
in the priesthood?

20
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:50,009
Seriously, Ted. If we could just
put joking aside for a minute.

21
00:01:50,099 --> 00:01:52,214
'Lent is a solemn time of year.'

22
00:01:52,298 --> 00:01:54,253
We've had our disagreements,

23
00:01:54,337 --> 00:01:57,407
but at the end of the day
we are brothers in Christ.

24
00:01:57,495 --> 00:01:59,450
Oh, well.

25
00:01:59,534 --> 00:02:02,285
We're making a special effort
this year.

26
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:05,363
I've given up cigarettes,
Father Johnson alcohol

27
00:02:05,451 --> 00:02:07,599
and Father MacDuff skateboarding.

28
00:02:07,689 --> 00:02:12,124
And the atmosphere of serenity
and devotion to Our Lord

29
00:02:12,207 --> 00:02:15,720
in the parochial house
is very special indeed.

30
00:02:15,805 --> 00:02:17,601
Right.

31
00:02:17,684 --> 00:02:21,277
So what about it, Ted?
Will you make a similar effort?

32
00:02:21,362 --> 00:02:25,558
Will you join us, Ted?
Will you go the extra mile this year?

33
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:29,233
I suppose you're right, Dick.
We should make a special effort.

34
00:02:29,318 --> 00:02:32,672
It'll be worth it, Ted.
God bless you.

35
00:02:32,756 --> 00:02:35,223
Goodbye, Dick, and erm...

36
00:02:35,314 --> 00:02:37,383
G-God bless you, Dick.

37
00:02:49,507 --> 00:02:51,974
So, that's it.
I'm giving up the fags.

38
00:02:52,065 --> 00:02:54,339
Father Jack can give
the old drink a miss

39
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:56,732
and no more rollerblading
until Easter.

40
00:02:56,823 --> 00:02:58,335
Easter's miles away.

41
00:02:58,422 --> 00:03:02,129
A sacrifice isn't easy.
Don't forget why we do this.

42
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,813
I know.
Because of the sacrifice Our Lord...

43
00:03:04,899 --> 00:03:08,412
More importantly, I'm not gonna
be beaten by Father Byrne

44
00:03:08,497 --> 00:03:10,770
in the giving-things-up competition.

45
00:03:10,855 --> 00:03:13,288
And that's what this is,
a competition.

46
00:03:13,374 --> 00:03:15,568
We've got to show him
what we can do.

47
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:18,768
Especially after
that Scrabble fiasco.

48
00:03:18,851 --> 00:03:21,080
You've never told us what happened.

49
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:23,921
I don't know how he did it,
he must've cheated!

50
00:03:24,008 --> 00:03:28,602
But he got all his words to say
"Useless priest can't say Mass."

51
00:03:30,165 --> 00:03:34,441
So no more fags,
rollerblading or booze until Easter.

52
00:03:34,523 --> 00:03:35,637
All right.

53
00:03:35,722 --> 00:03:37,996
Who wants their afternoon drink?

54
00:03:38,081 --> 00:03:40,036
Drink? Oh, yes!

55
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,313
- No.
- No?!

56
00:03:42,398 --> 00:03:45,116
You said you'd give it up
for a couple of days.

57
00:03:45,197 --> 00:03:48,631
- What?!
- Offer it up for Our Lord.

58
00:03:48,715 --> 00:03:52,547
Arlord? Who's Arlord?

59
00:03:52,633 --> 00:03:57,181
No, Our Lord.
I suppose I made your vow for you.

60
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:59,863
But I know you'd like
to make a sacrifice.

61
00:03:59,949 --> 00:04:02,666
Sacrifice? Arse!

62
00:04:02,747 --> 00:04:05,419
It's a special time
of the year for all of us.

63
00:04:05,506 --> 00:04:07,973
Drink! Drink!

64
00:04:08,065 --> 00:04:10,019
You won't find any there.

65
00:04:10,103 --> 00:04:12,570
- I've put them somewhere safe.
- Where?

66
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,338
Don't sulk, Father.

67
00:04:21,098 --> 00:04:24,213
Here we go. No more fags
for me now until Easter.

68
00:04:26,854 --> 00:04:29,572
Ah, great. No problem there at all.

69
00:04:29,653 --> 00:04:32,688
(Chuckling and sighing)

70
00:04:32,771 --> 00:04:36,762
God Almighty. I don't even miss
them at all. This is easy!

71
00:04:39,528 --> 00:04:43,837
Yes, I'm not even thinking about
smoking. Not thinking about it!

72
00:04:58,357 --> 00:05:00,824
It's beginning to kick in, Ted.

73
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:05,385
Me, too. God, this is terrible.
I don't like this at all!

74
00:05:05,474 --> 00:05:07,622
Maybe we should stick with it, Ted.

75
00:05:07,712 --> 00:05:10,987
We've come through worse.
Don't forget Dick Byrne.

76
00:05:11,071 --> 00:05:12,901
Blah, blah, blah, blah...

77
00:05:15,748 --> 00:05:18,022
Blah, blah, blah, blah...

78
00:05:18,107 --> 00:05:20,619
- Don't you think so, Ted?
- Hm? Oh.

79
00:05:20,705 --> 00:05:24,218
I certainly do. Absolutely.
How are you doing, Father?

80
00:05:24,303 --> 00:05:26,691
You all right?
Do you want me to...

81
00:05:26,782 --> 00:05:29,136
Blah, blah, blah, blah...

82
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:33,175
Blah, blah, blah...

83
00:05:33,259 --> 00:05:36,090
- Father?
- Is he all right?

84
00:05:36,177 --> 00:05:39,292
I think he's just
circling the airport.

85
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:41,968
- (Doorbell)
- Better get that. You Ok?

86
00:05:42,054 --> 00:05:43,532
What? Oh, yeah.

87
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:51,205
Don't make a show of yourself.

88
00:05:51,289 --> 00:05:54,597
"Yes, Father. Hello, Father.
You're so great, Father."

89
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:58,314
- Oh, you make me sick.
- You're feckin' worse.

90
00:05:58,405 --> 00:06:01,998
"Oh, Father, you're brilliant.
Father, you should be Pope."

91
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:04,642
It doesn't impress him.
Makes me sick.

92
00:06:04,722 --> 00:06:07,029
God, you're an...

93
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,679
- Ah, Father.
- Hello, John, Mary.

94
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,908
Father, you look wonderful.
Is that a new outfit?

95
00:06:15,796 --> 00:06:20,742
- We brought you some Easter eggs.
- Oh, that's terribly nice.

96
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:22,788
I think it comes to about Â£8.

97
00:06:25,111 --> 00:06:27,066
We thought we'd bring it down to you.

98
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:30,299
We're going on holidays and
we're not sure when we'll be back.

99
00:06:30,388 --> 00:06:34,664
- Yes, we're going to Rome.
- Oh! So looking forward to it!

100
00:06:34,746 --> 00:06:36,939
We might see your friend.

101
00:06:37,024 --> 00:06:39,218
Who's that, Sophia Loren?

102
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:44,530
No, Father. The Pope!

103
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,575
He's no friend of mine!

104
00:06:50,377 --> 00:06:54,163
Actually, that might've sounded
a little disrespectful. Sorry.

105
00:06:54,255 --> 00:06:56,324
No problem, Father.

106
00:07:04,969 --> 00:07:08,323
Ahhhhhhh.

107
00:07:38,311 --> 00:07:39,948
(Snoring)

108
00:07:42,509 --> 00:07:45,305
(Empty bottles clanging)

109
00:08:21,568 --> 00:08:23,125
(Thud)

110
00:08:23,207 --> 00:08:25,083
(Ted groaning)

111
00:08:34,361 --> 00:08:36,112
(Sighs )

112
00:08:46,195 --> 00:08:50,583
One day. You'd think we could
go one day without giving in.

113
00:08:50,672 --> 00:08:53,185
Hello? Hello.

114
00:08:53,271 --> 00:08:56,227
When I think of the sacrifices
Matty Hislop made.

115
00:08:56,309 --> 00:08:58,139
- Who?
- Matty Hislop.

116
00:08:58,228 --> 00:09:01,741
A drunkard who found God
and punished himself for his sins.

117
00:09:01,826 --> 00:09:03,338
He did all kinds of things.

118
00:09:03,425 --> 00:09:05,984
He had this terrible
allergy to cats.

119
00:09:06,064 --> 00:09:09,054
So he used to carry a kitten
in his pocket.

120
00:09:09,142 --> 00:09:11,450
And sniff it from time to time.

121
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:14,100
His head just inflated
like a balloon.

122
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:16,408
Fair play to him.

123
00:09:16,498 --> 00:09:19,773
Could you not knock the rollerblading
on the head for two weeks?

124
00:09:19,857 --> 00:09:23,893
I know. I know, Ted. I used to be
happy enough with the old bike,

125
00:09:23,974 --> 00:09:26,487
get a great buzz
going down to the shops.

126
00:09:26,573 --> 00:09:29,529
But after a while,
it just wasn't enough.

127
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:32,761
I just kept going for
bigger and bigger thrills.

128
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:36,204
But I can handle it.
I could quit any time I want.

129
00:09:36,288 --> 00:09:39,517
Well, you tried to quit
yesterday and you couldn't.

130
00:09:39,606 --> 00:09:43,995
You're right, Ted. I admit it.
I have a problem.

131
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:47,960
Come on. No need for that,
not now we're getting outside help.

132
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:50,508
Come on, come on.

133
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:54,352
God, why do nuns have such awful
music when you're on hold?

134
00:09:54,438 --> 00:09:57,553
If I hear Ave Maria
one more time, I don't know.

135
00:09:57,636 --> 00:09:59,273
Excuse me!

136
00:09:59,355 --> 00:10:04,824
# Ave Maria #

137
00:10:04,912 --> 00:10:06,902
- 'Excuse me!'
- Yes?

138
00:10:06,991 --> 00:10:09,550
'How much longer
am I going to be on hold?'

139
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:12,017
She'll be with you
in a second, Father.

140
00:10:12,108 --> 00:10:17,702
# Ave Maria #

141
00:10:17,785 --> 00:10:20,901
Hello, Sister Mary Gondola,
how can I help you?

142
00:10:20,984 --> 00:10:24,452
Ah, hello.
My name is Father Ted Crilly.

143
00:10:24,542 --> 00:10:26,497
Could you send somebody out?

144
00:10:26,581 --> 00:10:29,730
We have a small problem here
keeping our Lenten vows.

145
00:10:29,819 --> 00:10:31,695
What do you wish to give up?

146
00:10:31,778 --> 00:10:36,326
Well, erm, cigarettes, alcohol
and, erm...rollerblading.

147
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:41,328
All right. On special offer this
month we have the Lenten package.

148
00:10:41,413 --> 00:10:45,369
Â£150 plus VAT plus booking fee...

149
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:47,405
That's Â£200.

150
00:10:47,489 --> 00:10:52,003
Â£200?! I'm not trying to buy cocaine!

151
00:10:52,087 --> 00:10:54,804
We have a basic offer at Â£50.

152
00:10:54,885 --> 00:10:56,636
That'll do fine, thanks.

153
00:10:56,724 --> 00:11:00,351
Now, how do you wish to pay?
We accept all major credit cards.

154
00:11:00,442 --> 00:11:02,591
- (Beeping)
- Hold, please, Father.

155
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:09,594
# Ave Maria #

156
00:11:09,677 --> 00:11:12,588
(Snoring and growling)

157
00:11:12,676 --> 00:11:14,870
Listen, I'll have to ring you back.

158
00:11:14,955 --> 00:11:17,262
What's up with him, Ted?

159
00:11:18,713 --> 00:11:21,271
The last of the alcohol
has left his system.

160
00:11:21,351 --> 00:11:23,102
He might actually be sober.

161
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:26,897
Is that it? Are you seeing things
as they really are at last?

162
00:11:26,988 --> 00:11:29,137
Oh, my God!

163
00:11:30,386 --> 00:11:32,580
Yes, that's it, all right.

164
00:11:32,665 --> 00:11:36,941
Sobriety for Father Jack must be like
taking some mad hallucinogenic.

165
00:11:37,662 --> 00:11:39,413
Where are the other two?

166
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:43,375
The other two?

167
00:11:43,459 --> 00:11:46,575
Ah, I see.
The old vision's back to normal.

168
00:11:46,657 --> 00:11:50,046
- There's just the two of us.
- What do you two do, then?

169
00:11:50,136 --> 00:11:51,614
We're priests.

170
00:11:51,695 --> 00:11:54,048
What? Priests!

171
00:11:54,133 --> 00:11:57,408
Don't tell me I'm still
on that feckin' island!

172
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:03,522
Well... Well, yes, Father.

173
00:12:03,608 --> 00:12:04,961
How do you feel?

174
00:12:05,048 --> 00:12:07,640
Must be great to be sober
every once in a while.

175
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:09,681
Or even...every 12 years.

176
00:12:09,765 --> 00:12:13,119
- Chair!
- Well done, Father.

177
00:12:15,642 --> 00:12:18,552
- Curtains.
- Yes, that's right!

178
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:22,389
Floor!

179
00:12:22,478 --> 00:12:24,672
All coming back to you,
is it, Father?

180
00:12:27,276 --> 00:12:30,710
Gobshite! Yes!

181
00:12:31,473 --> 00:12:34,191
I remember! I remember!

182
00:12:36,191 --> 00:12:39,181
I'm off on my Lenten pilgrimage
now, Fathers.

183
00:12:40,029 --> 00:12:42,541
- Off to St Patrick's Hill.
- What's that, Ted?

184
00:12:42,627 --> 00:12:45,618
A big mountain. You have to take
your socks off to go up it.

185
00:12:45,706 --> 00:12:48,582
At the top, they chase you back
down with a big plank.

186
00:12:48,664 --> 00:12:50,619
It's great fun.

187
00:12:52,182 --> 00:12:55,570
Oh, I don't want it to be
any fun at all, Father.

188
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,934
I want a good miserable time.

189
00:12:58,019 --> 00:13:00,771
k eep me on the straight and narrow.

190
00:13:00,858 --> 00:13:04,485
I met a couple there last year,
it did them the world of good.

191
00:13:04,576 --> 00:13:08,452
They were a bit obsessed
with the old s-e-x.

192
00:13:08,533 --> 00:13:11,729
God, I'm glad I never think of
that type of thing,

193
00:13:11,812 --> 00:13:13,403
that whole sexual world.

194
00:13:13,491 --> 00:13:16,879
God, when you think of it, it's
a dirty, filthy thing, isn't it?

195
00:13:16,969 --> 00:13:19,959
Can you imagine, Father?

196
00:13:20,047 --> 00:13:21,718
Looking up at your husband

197
00:13:21,806 --> 00:13:25,433
and him standing over you
with his lead in his hand,

198
00:13:25,524 --> 00:13:29,197
wanting you to degrade yourself.

199
00:13:29,282 --> 00:13:31,841
God Almighty,
can you imagine that, Father?

200
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:38,908
Can you picture it, Father?
Get a good mental picture.

201
00:13:38,997 --> 00:13:42,385
Can you see him there,
ready to do the business?

202
00:13:42,475 --> 00:13:43,668
(Doorbell)

203
00:13:43,754 --> 00:13:47,381
DOORBELL! Doorbell, Mrs Doyle,
the doorbell.

204
00:13:47,472 --> 00:13:49,701
Hey, hey, hey! You there!

205
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:52,350
What the hell is this?

206
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:55,898
That's a spoon, Father.
Come on, she'll be here.

207
00:13:55,988 --> 00:13:59,376
- Hello... Ah! Sister Assumpta!
- Hello, Father.

208
00:13:59,466 --> 00:14:01,615
Dougal, do you remember
Sister Assumpta?

209
00:14:01,705 --> 00:14:03,342
Ah, no.

210
00:14:03,424 --> 00:14:05,653
She was here last year.

211
00:14:05,743 --> 00:14:08,619
Then we stayed with her
in the convent in kildare.

212
00:14:08,701 --> 00:14:10,258
Do you remember it?

213
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:15,127
Ah, you do. You were hit by the
car when you went down the shops.

214
00:14:15,217 --> 00:14:19,413
You must remember. Then you won
Â£100 with your lottery card?

215
00:14:19,495 --> 00:14:21,132
You must remember it.

216
00:14:21,214 --> 00:14:24,011
Weren't you arrested for shoplifting?

217
00:14:24,093 --> 00:14:27,879
I remember we had to go down to
the police station to get you.

218
00:14:27,971 --> 00:14:30,244
And the police station went on fire?

219
00:14:30,329 --> 00:14:32,717
And you had to be rescued
by helicopter?

220
00:14:32,808 --> 00:14:35,923
Do you remember?
You can't remember any of that?

221
00:14:36,006 --> 00:14:39,474
The helicopter! When you
fell out of the helicopter!

222
00:14:39,564 --> 00:14:42,077
Over the zoo!
Do you remember the tigers?

223
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:47,314
You don't remember?
You were wearing your blue jumper.

224
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,469
Ahh! Sister Assumpta! Hello!

225
00:14:51,638 --> 00:14:53,389
Hello.

226
00:14:54,676 --> 00:14:58,747
I had no idea you were with
the Matty Hislop crowd.

227
00:14:58,834 --> 00:15:00,824
Ever since I read his pamphlets,

228
00:15:00,913 --> 00:15:04,028
abstinence has been
both my keeper and my reward.

229
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:07,624
Great. Anyhow, all we want is the
basic Â£50 job, the bare essentials.

230
00:15:07,709 --> 00:15:10,586
k eep us off the booze
and fags and the rollerblading.

231
00:15:10,668 --> 00:15:13,897
I'm afraid the rollerblading
is my own particular vice.

232
00:15:13,986 --> 00:15:17,454
Well, we'll do our best.
I'm looking forward to it.

233
00:15:17,544 --> 00:15:21,694
You know, I sort of am.
Do us good to exercise the willpower.

234
00:15:21,782 --> 00:15:24,214
Father Jack,
are you looking forward to it?

235
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,051
You remember Father Jack?

236
00:15:26,139 --> 00:15:29,175
- Yes.
- Nan!

237
00:15:29,258 --> 00:15:30,975
No, it's "nun".

238
00:15:31,057 --> 00:15:34,764
Nun! Ahhhhh!

239
00:15:38,053 --> 00:15:39,405
Bye, Father!

240
00:15:39,492 --> 00:15:41,447
He's just gone for his walk.

241
00:15:46,088 --> 00:15:48,806
(Foghorn )

242
00:15:48,887 --> 00:15:52,002
Good morning, Fathers.
Breakfast in five minutes.

243
00:15:52,085 --> 00:15:54,757
God Almighty. What was that thing?

244
00:15:54,844 --> 00:15:57,356
Is there a fire in the house?

245
00:15:57,442 --> 00:15:59,716
I suppose it's just time to get up.

246
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:05,426
It's...it's 5am.
Look, Dougal. 5am.

247
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:09,585
God, I've never seen a clock
at 5am before.

248
00:16:09,676 --> 00:16:11,506
(Giggling)

249
00:16:12,594 --> 00:16:15,665
She's obviously made a mistake.
Let's go back to bed.

250
00:16:15,753 --> 00:16:18,060
Fair enough, Ted. What are you doing?

251
00:16:18,151 --> 00:16:21,347
Writing her a note to say we don't
usually get up till later.

252
00:16:21,429 --> 00:16:23,384
Oh. Good figuring, Ted.

253
00:16:34,422 --> 00:16:36,174
(Foghorn )

254
00:16:41,938 --> 00:16:45,485
Oh, I don't know. A bit of breakfast
and I suppose we'll be fine.

255
00:16:45,576 --> 00:16:48,806
- God, I hope so, Ted.
- Sister Assumpta,

256
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:52,681
we're only down for the basic
booze, fags and rollerblading deal.

257
00:16:52,773 --> 00:16:55,683
The getting up early thing,
it's great but...

258
00:16:55,771 --> 00:16:58,727
- This is water.
- That's right, Father.

259
00:17:00,329 --> 00:17:03,956
All right. Having a bit of a laugh
with the thickos from the island.

260
00:17:04,046 --> 00:17:05,798
Where's our real breakfast?

261
00:17:05,886 --> 00:17:07,761
Ted, I'd love a Pop-Tart.

262
00:17:12,762 --> 00:17:15,877
Yes, Father Dougal
likes his Pop-Tarts first thing.

263
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,189
I don't think Pop-Tarts
have any place

264
00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:20,234
in Our Lord's plan for the world.

265
00:17:20,318 --> 00:17:22,705
They have as much a place
as anything else.

266
00:17:22,796 --> 00:17:25,184
Maybe He doesn't take
a personal interest

267
00:17:25,275 --> 00:17:28,027
but I'm sure he delegates it
to someone important.

268
00:17:28,114 --> 00:17:30,831
- What about Frosties?
- The same thing.

269
00:17:30,912 --> 00:17:33,630
Not His idea, but He gave them
the green light.

270
00:17:33,711 --> 00:17:37,496
Oh, right. But if you take
Sugar Puffs or Lucky Charms...

271
00:17:37,588 --> 00:17:39,306
FATHERS, COULD YOU PLEA...!

272
00:17:39,387 --> 00:17:42,184
Could you please stop having
that conversation?

273
00:17:42,266 --> 00:17:46,893
Just finish your breakfast and come
outside for a daily punishment.

274
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:49,621
Fair enough, so.
We'll just finish the...

275
00:17:49,702 --> 00:17:52,931
Daily what?
I'm sorry, what did you say there?

276
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:54,771
Your daily punishment.

277
00:17:54,859 --> 00:17:57,974
Matty Hislop's ten-step
programme to rid you of pride,

278
00:17:58,057 --> 00:18:00,729
the greatest obstacle
to inner fulfilment.

279
00:18:00,816 --> 00:18:04,170
Oh. That sounds...sounds great.

280
00:18:06,733 --> 00:18:08,688
Now, how are we two doing?

281
00:18:08,772 --> 00:18:11,489
- (Ted shivering) F-Fine.
- More ice?

282
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:15,197
No, I might enjoy that too much.
Very refreshing, the old ice.

283
00:18:17,927 --> 00:18:20,042
Soon we can begin the ten steps.

284
00:18:20,126 --> 00:18:24,355
What? This isn't the first one?
There's still ten to go?

285
00:18:24,443 --> 00:18:27,195
Father, of course!
This is just to cleanse you.

286
00:18:27,282 --> 00:18:30,192
- A form of preparation.
- For what?!

287
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,554
Are we going into space?!

288
00:18:32,639 --> 00:18:34,913
I can't feel my legs!

289
00:18:37,236 --> 00:18:39,146
Oh, God. Still ten to go.

290
00:18:39,235 --> 00:18:42,146
Hopefully it'll just involve
a bit of an old pray.

291
00:18:50,309 --> 00:18:51,980
Ahhh!

292
00:19:20,053 --> 00:19:23,282
Oh, God, I'm looking forward
to this. Whoop!

293
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:24,929
(Screaming)

294
00:19:28,888 --> 00:19:32,323
Ted, guess what she's
replaced my mattress with?

295
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:39,161
Oh, that's it. That's it.
She's obviously insane, Dougal.

296
00:19:39,243 --> 00:19:41,233
We've got to get out of here.

297
00:19:41,322 --> 00:19:44,437
- Where'll we go?
- We know loads of people.

298
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,237
What about Mwengwe?

299
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:49,627
His parents are away for
the weekend and he's got satellite.

300
00:19:49,717 --> 00:19:53,344
(Sighing) Dougal,
he lives in Addis Ababa.

301
00:19:54,914 --> 00:19:58,587
- What about Dick Byrne?
- I'm not ringing Dick Byrne.

302
00:19:58,672 --> 00:20:01,583
I know. I'll call Father Larry Duff.

303
00:20:01,671 --> 00:20:03,706
He'll put us up for a while.

304
00:20:05,589 --> 00:20:07,704
(Mobile phone and buzzer)

305
00:20:07,788 --> 00:20:09,140
(Audience groans )

306
00:20:09,227 --> 00:20:11,342
(Mobile continues ringing)

307
00:20:11,426 --> 00:20:13,779
Oh, wait,
he told me not to call tonight.

308
00:20:13,864 --> 00:20:15,933
He's got this important thing on.

309
00:20:16,023 --> 00:20:19,138
I suppose it'll have to be
Father Dick Byrne on Rugged Island.

310
00:20:19,221 --> 00:20:22,656
Come on. I'll leave her a note
saying we've gone to a funeral.

311
00:20:22,739 --> 00:20:26,776
Or an autopsy. Why don't we say
we had to go to an autopsy instead?

312
00:20:26,857 --> 00:20:28,767
That'll be more exciting.

313
00:20:28,856 --> 00:20:31,289
No, Dougal.
A funeral is more believable.

314
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:33,887
- Oh, right.
- Now, listen.

315
00:20:33,973 --> 00:20:36,532
We've got to do this
as quietly as possible, Ok?

316
00:20:36,612 --> 00:20:40,603
Don't suddenly panic. If we
take it easy, we won't wake her.

317
00:20:45,647 --> 00:20:46,920
What was that?

318
00:20:47,006 --> 00:20:48,598
(Ted) RUN!

319
00:20:48,685 --> 00:20:51,198
(Crashing and pounding down stairs )

320
00:20:52,563 --> 00:20:54,996
(Door opening, shutting)

321
00:20:55,082 --> 00:20:57,037
(Car revving)

322
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,708
(Sister Assumpta ) Quiet in there!

323
00:21:03,997 --> 00:21:08,147
Come on, Fathers, we're to get an
early start or we'll miss the rain.

324
00:21:10,874 --> 00:21:12,306
Right.

325
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:20,106
(Ted) God, what a dump.

326
00:21:21,388 --> 00:21:24,059
They're probably asleep.
I'll just knock gently.

327
00:21:24,146 --> 00:21:26,420
Oh, right,
so's you won't wake them up.

328
00:21:26,505 --> 00:21:28,654
No, I'll wake them
so they can let us in.

329
00:21:28,744 --> 00:21:32,257
But then shouldn't you
just knock loudly?

330
00:21:32,342 --> 00:21:34,457
Right. Good point, Dougal.

331
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:51,085
- Ted, maybe they're not home.
- No, I definitely heard something.

332
00:22:07,163 --> 00:22:10,676
I should've known.
You just can't trust Dick Byrne.

333
00:22:10,761 --> 00:22:13,228
As priests go,
he's a really bad priest.

334
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:16,355
Yeah. And we've still got
38 days of Lent to go.

335
00:22:16,438 --> 00:22:18,507
I know.

336
00:22:18,597 --> 00:22:21,190
- (Ted chuckling)
- Erm...

337
00:22:21,276 --> 00:22:23,469
This isn't what it looks like.

338
00:22:24,714 --> 00:22:28,148
Well, this certainly puts
a different spin on things.

339
00:22:28,232 --> 00:22:30,267
You won't tell anyone, will you?

340
00:22:30,351 --> 00:22:33,705
I couldn't help it,
they were just so...chocolatey.

341
00:22:33,789 --> 00:22:35,824
I can't go back until after Easter.

342
00:22:35,908 --> 00:22:38,704
Please don't tell them
I gave into temptation.

343
00:22:38,786 --> 00:22:41,094
She's been eating chocolate!

344
00:22:41,185 --> 00:22:43,981
Oh, God! Please, Father.

345
00:22:44,063 --> 00:22:46,656
You must be so disappointed in me.

346
00:22:46,742 --> 00:22:49,618
If there's anything I can do
to make it up.

347
00:22:52,379 --> 00:22:55,016
Well, ah...

348
00:22:55,097 --> 00:22:57,166
Here's a mad idea.

349
00:22:57,256 --> 00:22:59,246
( # Rock)

350
00:23:02,373 --> 00:23:04,966
Hello, Sister. How can I help you?

351
00:23:43,591 --> 00:23:45,899
I'm back, Fathers!

352
00:23:47,789 --> 00:23:50,382
Oh, my God!

353
00:23:51,305 --> 00:24:51,356
