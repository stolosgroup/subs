2
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:25,234
(Helicopter)

3
00:00:29,318 --> 00:00:30,467
(Crash)

4
00:00:35,998 --> 00:00:39,468
Now, Tom, this is the first time
you've been trusted

5
00:00:39,558 --> 00:00:42,278
with such a large consignment
of raw sewage.

6
00:00:42,318 --> 00:00:46,478
–Are you sure you'll be all right?
–Don't worry about me at all.

7
00:00:46,518 --> 00:00:50,750
This button opens the doors
and this one shoots the sewage out.

8
00:00:50,838 --> 00:00:53,998
(Tom ) This for the doors
and this shoots the stuff out?

9
00:00:54,038 --> 00:00:57,189
–No, the other way around.
–Right you are!

10
00:00:58,398 --> 00:01:00,150
Good luck, so.

11
00:01:13,878 --> 00:01:18,349
July the 19th.
Why does that strike me as important?

12
00:01:18,438 --> 00:01:20,076
Yes!

13
00:01:20,158 --> 00:01:24,037
July 19th? I wouldn't know,
Ted, you big bollocks.

14
00:01:28,918 --> 00:01:30,431
I'm sorry?

15
00:01:30,518 --> 00:01:33,874
I said I wouldn't know, Ted,
you big bollocks.

16
00:01:36,118 --> 00:01:40,157
Have you been reading those
Roddy Doyle books again, Dougal?

17
00:01:41,678 --> 00:01:44,511
I have, yeah, Ted, you big gobshite.

18
00:01:44,598 --> 00:01:48,118
That's all very well.
But remember, they're just stories.

19
00:01:48,158 --> 00:01:51,194
Normal people like us
don't use that language.

20
00:01:51,198 --> 00:01:55,032
–This is the real world.
–Oh, you're right there, Ted.

21
00:01:56,118 --> 00:01:59,758
Anyway, any idea why July the 19th
should be so important?

22
00:01:59,798 --> 00:02:02,471
Would that be the day
the Ice Age ended?

23
00:02:05,078 --> 00:02:07,034
No, Dougal!

24
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:09,838
They can't be that precise
about the Ice Age.

25
00:02:09,878 --> 00:02:11,914
I'll look it up in the diary.

26
00:02:15,398 --> 00:02:20,074
July 19th. “On this day,
Galway liberated from Indians…

27
00:02:22,398 --> 00:02:24,468
“Marathon becomes Snickers”…

28
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:29,714
A-ha, Ted! “Ice Age ends.”

29
00:02:32,998 --> 00:02:34,716
Time for tea, Fathers.

30
00:02:34,798 --> 00:02:37,918
Mrs Doyle, is anything
important about July the 19th?

31
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:40,478
It doesn't matter
what day it is, Father,

32
00:02:40,518 --> 00:02:43,476
there's always time
for a nice cup of tea.

33
00:02:43,558 --> 00:02:47,598
Didn't our Lord Himself on the cross
pause for a nice cup of tea

34
00:02:47,638 --> 00:02:50,078
before giving Himself up
for the world?

35
00:02:50,118 --> 00:02:51,790
No, He didn't, Mrs Doyle!

36
00:02:51,878 --> 00:02:55,244
Whatever equivalent
they had for tea in those days—

37
00:02:55,278 --> 00:02:57,234
cake or whatever.

38
00:02:57,318 --> 00:03:00,276
And speaking of cake… I have cake.

39
00:03:00,358 --> 00:03:02,038
I'm fine for cake, Mrs Doyle.

40
00:03:02,078 --> 00:03:04,194
Are you sure, Father?

41
00:03:04,278 --> 00:03:06,348
There's cocaine in it.

42
00:03:08,038 --> 00:03:09,949
There's what⁈

43
00:03:10,038 --> 00:03:13,189
Oh, no, not cocaine.
What am I on about?

44
00:03:13,278 --> 00:03:16,031
No, I meant…
What do you call them?

45
00:03:16,118 --> 00:03:17,995
Raisins.

46
00:03:18,078 --> 00:03:21,787
Right. I won't, thanks.

47
00:03:21,878 --> 00:03:24,187
Ah, you will.

48
00:03:24,278 --> 00:03:27,710
Sure, it's only small.
It's just a tiny little cake.

49
00:03:27,758 --> 00:03:31,158
You won't feel it.
You won't even know you're eatin' it.

50
00:03:31,198 --> 00:03:33,904
No, I will know
I'm eating it, Mrs Doyle.

51
00:03:33,918 --> 00:03:36,238
No, you won't!
Look at the size of it!

52
00:03:36,278 --> 00:03:39,554
It's hardly even a cake.
It's a micro-cake.

53
00:03:39,638 --> 00:03:42,758
–No, Mrs Doyle, I really won't…
–Aw, come on now.

54
00:03:42,798 --> 00:03:44,709
It's got raisins…

55
00:03:44,798 --> 00:03:46,754
cherries… cinnamon!

56
00:03:46,838 --> 00:03:48,635
–Cinnamon?
–Oh, yes.

57
00:03:48,718 --> 00:03:52,108
I do love cinnamon.
What the heck, I'll have one.

58
00:03:52,198 --> 00:03:53,392
Great!

59
00:03:53,478 --> 00:03:56,356
No. No, Father, I'm forcing you.

60
00:03:56,438 --> 00:03:59,271
No, you're not. Really!

61
00:03:59,358 --> 00:04:02,790
–I love cinnamon.
–No, no, you're just being polite.

62
00:04:02,838 --> 00:04:06,433
If you don't want any,
all you have to do is say “no”.

63
00:04:06,518 --> 00:04:08,793
Just that one little word, “no”.

64
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:13,318
It's a lovely word our Lord gave us
to use when we don't want any cake.

65
00:04:13,358 --> 00:04:16,598
Yes, but just this once,
I'd actually love some cake.

66
00:04:16,638 --> 00:04:18,549
Well, you can't have any!

67
00:04:18,638 --> 00:04:20,151
I want cake!

68
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:23,628
No, I'm just going out
to have these destroyed.

69
00:04:23,718 --> 00:04:25,629
Sorry about that, Father.

70
00:04:27,398 --> 00:04:30,356
Anyway, this date thing
is bothering me now.

71
00:04:30,438 --> 00:04:33,958
July the 19th. Is there something
we always do on July 19th?

72
00:04:33,998 --> 00:04:36,466
–(Crashing)
–(Jack) Drink!

73
00:04:37,598 --> 00:04:40,518
–Is it something to do with Jack?
–Maybe it's…

74
00:04:40,558 --> 00:04:43,998
–Oh, God, it's not his bath⁈
–Oh, no, it couldn't be!

75
00:04:44,038 --> 00:04:46,942
No, wait! Calm down!
He's just had his bath!

76
00:04:46,998 --> 00:04:49,114
Remember? Just before Christmas.

77
00:04:49,198 --> 00:04:52,634
Oh, thank God for that!
God Almighty!

78
00:04:54,318 --> 00:04:56,274
–You Ok?
–I think so.

79
00:04:57,478 --> 00:04:59,230
So what could it be?

80
00:05:02,518 --> 00:05:05,316
A-ha! Holiday.

81
00:05:10,238 --> 00:05:12,944
(Ted) Come on, Dougal.
Better get moving.

82
00:05:15,798 --> 00:05:17,558
Where'll be go on holiday, Ted?

83
00:05:17,598 --> 00:05:20,431
–God, I don't know.
–Pearson's?

84
00:05:20,518 --> 00:05:24,989
Mr Pearson doesn't like people
staying. It's not a guesthouse.

85
00:05:25,078 --> 00:05:27,308
–Is it not?
–No, no.

86
00:05:27,398 --> 00:05:31,558
Remember the argument last year when
we tried to stay the second week?

87
00:05:31,598 --> 00:05:36,035
Wait! Father O'Rourke's caravan!
He said we could use it anytime.

88
00:05:36,118 --> 00:05:39,030
Oh, no, Ted, not again!
It's very small.

89
00:05:39,118 --> 00:05:43,350
No, he got a new one. Apparently
it's twice as big. Let's go!

90
00:05:48,278 --> 00:05:52,556
–He said it's the one at the end.
–There it is! Look! It's HUGE!

91
00:05:52,638 --> 00:05:54,558
Calm down. We're here, Father.

92
00:05:54,598 --> 00:05:55,951
(Jack) Feck off.

93
00:05:56,038 --> 00:05:59,917
I think it's the best caravan
in the whole world.

94
00:05:59,998 --> 00:06:01,431
Dougal?

95
00:06:01,518 --> 00:06:05,557
Where's the trailer
with all the stuff in it?

96
00:06:09,358 --> 00:06:12,748
Next you'll tell me
you didn't lock the front door!

97
00:06:14,078 --> 00:06:16,353
Ah, Ted, come on…

98
00:06:16,438 --> 00:06:17,712
Drink!

99
00:06:17,798 --> 00:06:19,998
In a minute, Father, I promise you.

100
00:06:20,038 --> 00:06:23,474
This is great, isn't it, Ted?
Telly and all.

101
00:06:23,558 --> 00:06:25,628
This is what it's all about.

102
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:28,518
(Woman ) Wait a second!
You've got to do my back!

103
00:06:28,558 --> 00:06:32,980
(Man ) I'm wrinklin' like a raisin
in there. I'll be back in a sec.

104
00:06:49,598 --> 00:06:51,395
Father Ted Crilly,

105
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:56,598
Craggy Island Parochial House,
Craggy Island.

106
00:06:56,678 --> 00:06:59,829
That's C-R-A-G-G-Y Island.

107
00:07:00,918 --> 00:07:04,069
Honestly, Officer,
I can't apologise enough…

108
00:07:04,158 --> 00:07:06,626
God, that was so embarrassing!

109
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:09,424
Ted, if that's not our one,
which one is?

110
00:07:10,878 --> 00:07:12,550
(Door creaks)

111
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:21,852
Sure, this is great. And it is bigger
than last year's one.

112
00:07:24,078 --> 00:07:26,034
What'll we do first, Ted?

113
00:07:26,838 --> 00:07:29,113
We'll take it easy for a while,

114
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:31,917
just get settled
into the old caravan.

115
00:07:35,478 --> 00:07:38,038
Right, that's enough of that.

116
00:07:38,118 --> 00:07:39,392
Where'll we go?

117
00:07:39,478 --> 00:07:41,548
Here's a booklet, Ted.

118
00:07:41,638 --> 00:07:43,594
Places of interest.

119
00:07:44,278 --> 00:07:48,112
St Kevin's Stump…
Mmm, that sounds good.

120
00:07:48,198 --> 00:07:50,268
The Magic Road! Oh-ho!

121
00:07:51,998 --> 00:07:54,512
Two places of interest.

122
00:07:54,598 --> 00:07:56,198
What's the Magic Road, Ted?

123
00:07:56,238 --> 00:07:59,838
A bizarre natural wonder
where everything's gone haywire

124
00:07:59,878 --> 00:08:01,838
and nothing works like it should.

125
00:08:01,878 --> 00:08:05,234
A bit like you, Dougal.
Except it's a road.

126
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:08,438
I still don't understand.
It's a kind of a mad road?

127
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:10,478
It's called a strange phenomenon.

128
00:08:10,518 --> 00:08:13,798
If you took off a car's hand-brake,
it'd roll UP-hill.

129
00:08:13,838 --> 00:08:15,198
And water flows UP it.

130
00:08:15,238 --> 00:08:19,238
That's as mad as what you told
me about the loaves and fishes!

131
00:08:19,278 --> 00:08:22,031
No, Dougal. That's not mad.

132
00:08:22,118 --> 00:08:25,038
That's when our Lord got
one or two bits of food

133
00:08:25,078 --> 00:08:28,078
and turned it into
a whole pile of food for dinner.

134
00:08:28,118 --> 00:08:30,678
God, He was fantastic, wasn't He?

135
00:08:30,758 --> 00:08:32,953
Ah, He was brilliant.

136
00:08:34,118 --> 00:08:37,076
–Father, have any preferences?
–HOLIDAY!

137
00:08:37,158 --> 00:08:40,238
Yes, we're on holiday.
Would you like to go anywhere?

138
00:08:40,278 --> 00:08:43,350
–WHAT?
–Would you like to go somewhere?

139
00:08:43,438 --> 00:08:45,633
WHO ARE YOU?

140
00:08:45,718 --> 00:08:50,155
I was asking, would you like
to go somewhere now that we're here?

141
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:53,150
–Perhaps for a lovely walk?
–I LlkE CAkE!

142
00:08:53,238 --> 00:08:57,595
Yes, I think I'll just
stop talking to Father Jack now.

143
00:08:57,678 --> 00:09:00,988
Where am I? What's that thing there?

144
00:09:01,078 --> 00:09:03,034
Are those my feet?

145
00:09:04,278 --> 00:09:07,429
Let's get him to sleep
and head off ourselves.

146
00:09:07,518 --> 00:09:09,986
Ok, Father… into your box.

147
00:09:10,078 --> 00:09:13,991
Drink! Arse! Girls!

148
00:09:14,078 --> 00:09:15,716
Dri… (Snoring)

149
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:20,830
Let's go and look for the Magic Road.
The holiday starts here!

150
00:09:26,998 --> 00:09:29,193
Come on, let's play Scrabble.

151
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:31,951
Did you bring the travel Scrabble?

152
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:35,792
I brought the normal Scrabble
AND the travel Scrabble.

153
00:09:35,878 --> 00:09:39,798
Travel Scrabble for travelling
and the normal for when we arrived.

154
00:09:39,838 --> 00:09:41,317
Good man.

155
00:09:41,398 --> 00:09:46,267
Ah, no, now that I think of it,
I didn't bring either of them.

156
00:09:46,358 --> 00:09:49,316
–Right.
–God, I'm an awful eejit.

157
00:09:50,558 --> 00:09:53,914
So… what do we do
for the next two weeks?

158
00:09:53,998 --> 00:09:55,954
Will I put on the kettle?

159
00:09:56,038 --> 00:09:57,710
Yeah, go on.

160
00:09:57,798 --> 00:09:59,789
(kettle hums)

161
00:10:02,158 --> 00:10:05,722
Must be one of the ones
that clicks off automatically.

162
00:10:05,758 --> 00:10:06,907
Yes…

163
00:10:07,998 --> 00:10:09,989
Bit of steam there.

164
00:10:11,038 --> 00:10:13,791
Incidentally,
did you bring any teabags?

165
00:10:13,878 --> 00:10:15,436
No.

166
00:10:16,318 --> 00:10:17,592
Right!

167
00:10:21,158 --> 00:10:22,910
(kettle clicks off)

168
00:10:22,998 --> 00:10:25,148
kettle's boiled there, Ted.

169
00:10:25,238 --> 00:10:26,307
Hmm, yeah.

170
00:10:26,398 --> 00:10:29,595
Will I put more water in
and turn it on again?

171
00:10:31,078 --> 00:10:33,956
No, I liked it best the first time.

172
00:10:35,878 --> 00:10:40,078
Maybe we could turn it on with
no water at all, see what happens.

173
00:10:40,118 --> 00:10:43,318
I don't think you should do that. It
would just blow up.

174
00:10:43,358 --> 00:10:47,397
You'd be picking lumps of metal
out of your face for a year.

175
00:10:47,478 --> 00:10:50,754
You'd have puffy fish lips
bigger than your face.

176
00:10:51,838 --> 00:10:53,237
Like Father Bigley.

177
00:10:53,318 --> 00:10:55,991
Exactly like Father Bigley.

178
00:10:56,078 --> 00:10:58,546
Maybe that's what happened to him.

179
00:11:01,918 --> 00:11:04,386
96… 97…

180
00:11:04,478 --> 00:11:07,595
98… 99…

181
00:11:07,678 --> 00:11:10,954
100! Coming…

182
00:11:12,398 --> 00:11:14,354
ready or not.

183
00:11:18,238 --> 00:11:20,593
–Found you.
–Ahh!

184
00:11:20,678 --> 00:11:22,430
It's your go.

185
00:11:24,678 --> 00:11:27,351
One… two…

186
00:11:27,438 --> 00:11:30,908
three… four…

187
00:11:30,998 --> 00:11:32,954
five… six…

188
00:11:35,678 --> 00:11:38,511
Ok, one last time.

189
00:11:38,598 --> 00:11:41,396
These are small,

190
00:11:41,478 --> 00:11:44,868
but the ones out there are far away.

191
00:11:51,918 --> 00:11:54,193
Small…

192
00:11:54,278 --> 00:11:56,394
far away.

193
00:11:58,198 --> 00:11:59,756
Ah, forget it!

194
00:12:08,278 --> 00:12:12,040
Ted, you know how your eyes
sometimes play tricks on you?

195
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:17,748
–I know! Father Larry Duff!
–Ah, Larry!

196
00:12:17,838 --> 00:12:21,558
He sometimes comes around this area.
He's tremendous fun.

197
00:12:21,598 --> 00:12:24,998
I'll call him on his mobile phone.
I got him one for Christmas.

198
00:12:25,038 --> 00:12:27,798
He's always complaining
that nobody rings him.

199
00:12:27,838 --> 00:12:30,068
(Humming cheerfully)

200
00:12:31,558 --> 00:12:33,708
(Ringing)

201
00:12:35,398 --> 00:12:36,547
AHHHHHH!

202
00:12:46,038 --> 00:12:47,949
Must have it switched off.

203
00:12:54,758 --> 00:12:57,192
Why's it called St Kevin's Stump?

204
00:12:59,398 --> 00:13:01,354
It doesn't say.

205
00:13:04,678 --> 00:13:07,358
So is this what all
holidays are like, Ted?

206
00:13:07,398 --> 00:13:09,229
Actually… yeah.

207
00:13:09,318 --> 00:13:11,398
Anyway, we'd better get back to Jack.

208
00:13:11,438 --> 00:13:13,478
He said he'd stay put by the cliffs.

209
00:13:13,518 --> 00:13:15,474
(Snoring)

210
00:13:22,758 --> 00:13:24,635
Drink!

211
00:13:24,718 --> 00:13:28,597
Drink! Drink! Drink!

212
00:13:30,078 --> 00:13:33,195
Can we go over to
the rock and back, Ted?

213
00:13:33,278 --> 00:13:35,155
Well…

214
00:13:35,238 --> 00:13:38,753
Come on, Ted, we're on holidays.
Live a little.

215
00:13:38,838 --> 00:13:41,147
All right, but then back to Jack.

216
00:13:41,238 --> 00:13:43,069
Drink! Drink!

217
00:13:43,158 --> 00:13:45,718
Dri-I-I-I-I-I…!

218
00:13:46,998 --> 00:13:48,716
(Thud)

219
00:13:50,638 --> 00:13:52,594
Well, here we are.

220
00:13:54,158 --> 00:13:56,198
Will we go over to that fence now?

221
00:13:56,238 --> 00:13:58,838
No, we might just blow up
with excitement.

222
00:13:58,878 --> 00:14:01,346
Let's save something for next week.

223
00:14:07,438 --> 00:14:09,394
(Woman moaning)

224
00:14:22,158 --> 00:14:24,467
Father Ted Crilly,

225
00:14:24,558 --> 00:14:27,152
Craggy Island Parochial House…

226
00:14:27,238 --> 00:14:29,798
C-R… Sure, you know all that.

227
00:14:29,878 --> 00:14:33,518
Listen, you know the business
of reporting missing persons?

228
00:14:33,558 --> 00:14:35,010
I've heard of it, yes.

229
00:14:35,038 --> 00:14:37,678
Does it cost money
to report a missing person?

230
00:14:37,718 --> 00:14:39,470
–No.
–Great.

231
00:14:39,558 --> 00:14:42,718
We've lost one of our party—
Father Jack Hackett.

232
00:14:42,758 --> 00:14:44,870
God, how would you describe him?

233
00:14:44,918 --> 00:14:47,034
–Mid-fifties…
–To mid-eighties.

234
00:14:47,118 --> 00:14:49,164
Tremendous smell of vegetables.

235
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:51,718
–Angry. Very angry man.
–Hates children.

236
00:14:51,758 --> 00:14:53,510
Likes the odd drink.

237
00:14:53,598 --> 00:14:57,638
And don't come up on him from behind,
he won't like that at all.

238
00:14:57,678 --> 00:15:01,910
One thing— do you carry
those electric stunner gadgets?

239
00:15:01,998 --> 00:15:05,195
–No. Why?
–Oh, no reason.

240
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:07,918
Right, anything else
I can do while I'm here?

241
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:11,118
Want to confess to any
unsolved murders or anything?

242
00:15:11,158 --> 00:15:14,038
No, we're fine for the old…
unsolved murders.

243
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:16,797
Some holiday
this is turning out to be!

244
00:15:16,878 --> 00:15:20,798
Come on. Now Jack's gone,
there'll be more room in the caravan.

245
00:15:20,838 --> 00:15:24,148
♫ Ebony and ivory

246
00:15:24,238 --> 00:15:27,992
♫ Live together in perfect harmony

247
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:31,195
♫ Side by side on my piano keyboard

248
00:15:31,278 --> 00:15:34,554
♫ Oh, Lord, why can't we-e-e-e ♫

249
00:15:34,638 --> 00:15:36,788
–Ted!
–Hello, Noel.

250
00:15:36,878 --> 00:15:38,462
What are you doing here?

251
00:15:38,478 --> 00:15:40,912
Well, this is our caravan…

252
00:15:40,998 --> 00:15:44,298
–Father O'Rourke offered it to us!
–Yes, so I see.

253
00:15:44,358 --> 00:15:45,958
He must say it to everyone.

254
00:15:45,998 --> 00:15:48,878
Room for two more
in the St Luke's Youth Group?

255
00:15:48,918 --> 00:15:50,478
–(Groan )
–Motion passed!

256
00:15:50,518 --> 00:15:53,998
Sit down and we'll have a song.
Will you sing one, Ted?

257
00:15:54,038 --> 00:15:55,630
No, I won't, thanks…

258
00:15:55,718 --> 00:15:58,949
You've a lovely voice!
Very like Celine Dion!

259
00:16:01,118 --> 00:16:04,518
We can dance, then!
Tony, stick on the Riverdance album!

260
00:16:04,558 --> 00:16:08,995
Actually…
Actually, Noel, I'm quite tired.

261
00:16:09,078 --> 00:16:13,754
What? Actually, we're all a bit
exhausted from the old singing.

262
00:16:13,838 --> 00:16:17,797
Some of us overdid it
down the old local last night!

263
00:16:17,878 --> 00:16:20,950
Gerry Fields
knows who I'm talking about!

264
00:16:21,038 --> 00:16:22,517
Huh, what, eh?

265
00:16:22,598 --> 00:16:24,395
Yeah.

266
00:16:24,478 --> 00:16:28,949
We arrived back at…
God! it must have been half ten!

267
00:16:29,038 --> 00:16:31,552
And some of us crawled in!

268
00:16:31,638 --> 00:16:34,198
Janine Reilly
knows what I'm talking about!

269
00:16:34,238 --> 00:16:36,115
–Don't you⁈
–Yeah…

270
00:16:36,198 --> 00:16:38,393
And she wasn't the only one!

271
00:16:38,478 --> 00:16:39,706
Tony Lynch!

272
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:43,871
TONY LYNCH! He knows!
Look at him, all sweetness and light!

273
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:48,474
He wasn't when he crawled
into bed at ten past eleven!

274
00:16:48,558 --> 00:16:52,153
Hello. Father Noel Furlong.
You're a fine young fella.

275
00:16:52,238 --> 00:16:55,558
What age would you say I am? Guess.
What age would you say?

276
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:57,509
He knows. Don't tell him!

277
00:16:57,598 --> 00:16:59,828
Go on, guess. What would you say?

278
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:01,874
40.

279
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:06,792
Ted, haven't seen you in ages.
How are you?

280
00:17:06,878 --> 00:17:09,233
♫ I SAW THE WHOLE OF THE MOON

281
00:17:09,318 --> 00:17:12,278
♫ There at the turnstiles
with the wind at your heels

282
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:16,277
♫ You stretched for the stars
and you know how it feels

283
00:17:16,358 --> 00:17:17,837
♫ Too high

284
00:17:17,918 --> 00:17:19,556
♫ Too far

285
00:17:19,638 --> 00:17:24,507
♫ Too soon,
you saw the whole of the moon ♫

286
00:17:25,998 --> 00:17:29,229
♫ Dirty old town

287
00:17:29,318 --> 00:17:31,832
♫ Dirty old to-o-own! ♫

288
00:17:31,918 --> 00:17:34,198
Oh, God, Ted, they have me worn out!

289
00:17:34,238 --> 00:17:36,354
They're a mad crowd!

290
00:17:36,438 --> 00:17:37,553
What time is it?

291
00:17:37,638 --> 00:17:40,550
Half ten! know what?

292
00:17:40,638 --> 00:17:42,158
We should all go to bed.

293
00:17:42,198 --> 00:17:45,873
Where's Tony Lynch off to?
Probably to get some heroin!

294
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:48,518
No, I'm just going
to the toilet, Father.

295
00:17:48,558 --> 00:17:53,074
Anyone else need to go?
Ted, Dougal, are you Ok?

296
00:17:53,158 --> 00:17:54,758
We're grand, thanks, Noel.

297
00:17:54,798 --> 00:17:57,174
Sure you don't need a little tinkle?

298
00:17:57,238 --> 00:17:59,752
I'm fine, thanks. I'll go again.

299
00:17:59,838 --> 00:18:02,718
Don't keep it in,
your bladder could go mental.

300
00:18:02,758 --> 00:18:05,795
–Yes…
–My friend Father Sweeney,

301
00:18:05,878 --> 00:18:09,678
he had a bladder about the size
of a Terry's Chocolate Orange…

302
00:18:09,718 --> 00:18:11,197
NOEL!

303
00:18:11,278 --> 00:18:16,398
I REALLY… I'm fine. Ok? I'm fine.

304
00:18:17,998 --> 00:18:20,353
You're like a bunch of camels!

305
00:18:20,438 --> 00:18:23,475
Anyway, we'll get
the sleeping bags out.

306
00:18:23,558 --> 00:18:25,514
Will it not be a bit cramped?

307
00:18:25,598 --> 00:18:28,829
Not at all. The more the merrier!

308
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:36,596
(Noel) St Colum's had a great
football team in the mid-'50s.

309
00:18:36,678 --> 00:18:39,431
They won the Father Fitzgibbon Cup.

310
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:43,598
Father Fitzgibbon. The thing about
him was he LOOkED like a cup!

311
00:18:43,638 --> 00:18:47,028
Great big ears like handles!

312
00:18:47,118 --> 00:18:48,995
Do you remember him, Ted?

313
00:18:49,078 --> 00:18:51,114
Ted? Do you remember?

314
00:18:51,198 --> 00:18:53,871
YES! I remember him, Noel.

315
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:57,997
Oooohh! Who's a bit
of a Moaning Michael tonight?

316
00:18:59,198 --> 00:19:02,696
God Almighty, it's nearly
six o'clock in the morning!

317
00:19:03,798 --> 00:19:07,188
I think what
we should all do now is…

318
00:19:07,278 --> 00:19:09,234
TELL A FEW GHOST STORIES!

319
00:19:10,478 --> 00:19:12,594
–Ted?
–Yes?

320
00:19:12,678 --> 00:19:13,747
I'm going mad.

321
00:19:13,838 --> 00:19:17,387
Yes, let's get out of here,
let's go home.

322
00:19:17,478 --> 00:19:19,196
(Noel) Whoooo!

323
00:19:20,718 --> 00:19:22,834
Who's that now?

324
00:19:22,918 --> 00:19:25,878
Is that Gerry Fields
heading off to the disco?

325
00:19:25,918 --> 00:19:28,358
We're just heading out
for some fresh air.

326
00:19:28,398 --> 00:19:30,912
Don't forget to bring us back some!

327
00:19:30,998 --> 00:19:33,558
Right so… you big feckin' eejit!

328
00:19:38,238 --> 00:19:40,354
What about Jack?

329
00:19:40,438 --> 00:19:44,878
Chances are he's on Craggy Island.
He has an amazing homing instinct.

330
00:19:44,918 --> 00:19:47,198
We'll find him
with a smile on his face

331
00:19:47,238 --> 00:19:49,918
and his arms outstretched
to welcome us back.

332
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:51,357
What?

333
00:19:51,438 --> 00:19:54,077
Well, maybe not
the smile on his face…

334
00:19:55,718 --> 00:19:57,674
or the outstretched arms…

335
00:19:57,758 --> 00:20:01,114
or the welcome back,
but he's probably there.

336
00:20:01,758 --> 00:20:04,398
Oh, God, your man!
Don't let him see us!

337
00:20:21,198 --> 00:20:23,792
Gerry! Gerry!

338
00:20:23,878 --> 00:20:25,311
Gerry!

339
00:20:26,718 --> 00:20:29,869
–Open! Please open!
–He's a fair bit away yet.

340
00:20:31,998 --> 00:20:34,910
Might be worth speeding up
there a bit, Ted.

341
00:20:38,758 --> 00:20:40,635
Sorry about that.

342
00:20:40,718 --> 00:20:42,117
Bloody perverts!

343
00:20:50,358 --> 00:20:53,873
He's probably very cold
now his towel's blown away.

344
00:20:56,758 --> 00:20:59,200
(Dougal) Maybe we should let him off.

345
00:20:59,278 --> 00:21:03,558
I've been thinking about it, but I'm
sure he'll start giving out to us.

346
00:21:03,598 --> 00:21:06,718
–Pretend we didn't see him.
–I doubt he'd believe us.

347
00:21:06,758 --> 00:21:11,707
–We'd better let him off, Ted.
–Oh, all right. I suppose so.

348
00:21:16,278 --> 00:21:18,746
–Get out of the car!
–Hello again.

349
00:21:18,838 --> 00:21:21,557
Get out of the car. Right!

350
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:24,958
I think he's calming down a bit.

351
00:21:24,998 --> 00:21:28,513
–(Breaking glass)
–Ah, now! Now…!

352
00:21:28,598 --> 00:21:33,831
Come on! There's absolutely no need
for that type of nonsense!

353
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:35,964
He's puncturing the tyres, Ted.

354
00:21:38,758 --> 00:21:41,992
You're impressing nobody
with that type of thing!

355
00:21:50,998 --> 00:21:53,838
God, Ted, I'm so tired.
Maybe we should go back.

356
00:21:53,878 --> 00:21:56,878
Oh, no! I'm not going anywhere near
Noel Furlong again.

357
00:21:56,918 --> 00:21:58,678
God knows what they're up to by now!

358
00:21:58,718 --> 00:22:00,674
(Irish jig)

359
00:22:22,078 --> 00:22:23,909
(Horn )

360
00:22:24,998 --> 00:22:27,718
Ted, it's a big truck!
It can give us a lift!

361
00:22:27,758 --> 00:22:29,908
Oh, thank God!

362
00:22:31,638 --> 00:22:33,356
Hello, Fathers.

363
00:22:33,438 --> 00:22:36,555
Tom, thank God, Tom!
We need a lift.

364
00:22:36,638 --> 00:22:39,344
Fair enough, Fathers.
I'll open the door.

365
00:22:45,398 --> 00:22:47,434
(Rumbling and whooshing)

366
00:23:03,038 --> 00:23:05,188
Sorry about that, Fathers.

367
00:23:16,598 --> 00:23:17,792
(Mumbling)

368
00:23:17,878 --> 00:23:19,436
Father, you're awake!

369
00:23:19,518 --> 00:23:22,794
Thank God! It took us ages
to pull you on board.

370
00:23:22,878 --> 00:23:24,106
(Muttering)

371
00:23:24,198 --> 00:23:26,871
Will you have something to drink?

372
00:23:31,958 --> 00:23:36,236
96… 97… 98… 99… 100.

373
00:23:36,318 --> 00:23:38,115
Coming now, ready or not.

373
00:23:39,305 --> 00:24:39,879
