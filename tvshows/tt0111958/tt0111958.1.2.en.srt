1
00:00:04,407 --> 00:00:07,641
Ted, if you had three wishes,
what would they be?

2
00:00:07,647 --> 00:00:10,400
Three wishes? I don't know, really.

3
00:00:10,447 --> 00:00:13,325
I suppose
the first one'd be world peace,

4
00:00:13,367 --> 00:00:16,200
and then maybe an end to hunger

5
00:00:16,247 --> 00:00:18,124
and, er…

6
00:00:18,167 --> 00:00:20,044
(Disco music)

7
00:00:21,407 --> 00:00:25,002
more money for hospitals
and that type of thing.

8
00:00:25,047 --> 00:00:26,639
Fair enough, Ted.

9
00:00:26,687 --> 00:00:29,007
And what would your three wishes be?

10
00:00:29,047 --> 00:00:31,481
Oh, no, I'm happy enough, really.

11
00:00:31,527 --> 00:00:34,727
–You wouldn't want anything?
–No, I don't think so.

12
00:00:34,767 --> 00:00:37,281
I can't think of anything, anyway.

13
00:00:38,767 --> 00:00:42,167
You wouldn't, say, want a big car
to drive around in?

14
00:00:42,207 --> 00:00:44,198
Oh-ho, wow!

15
00:00:44,247 --> 00:00:46,124
That'd be fantastic!

16
00:00:46,167 --> 00:00:49,477
Driving around in a big car—
that'd be brilliant!

17
00:00:49,527 --> 00:00:51,518
(Panting)

18
00:00:53,767 --> 00:00:55,767
What would be your second wish?

19
00:00:55,807 --> 00:00:58,315
Oh, that'd be fine.
The car'd be fine.

20
00:00:58,327 --> 00:01:02,764
You wouldn't like to be a rock star
or something, like Elvis?

21
00:01:02,807 --> 00:01:04,604
Oh-ho, God, yeah!

22
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:07,807
I'd love to be a rock star
like Elvis or something!

23
00:01:07,847 --> 00:01:09,644
That'd be brilliant!

24
00:01:13,087 --> 00:01:16,124
So, uh, your third wish,
if you had one?

25
00:01:16,167 --> 00:01:17,759
Oh, no, that'd be fine.

26
00:01:17,807 --> 00:01:21,173
If I had a big car
and I was Elvis that'd be grand.

27
00:01:23,367 --> 00:01:25,278
You wouldn't like, say, um…

28
00:01:26,327 --> 00:01:27,760
this cup?

29
00:01:27,807 --> 00:01:29,798
Oh, God, yeah!

30
00:01:30,967 --> 00:01:32,719
I'd love that cup!

31
00:01:32,767 --> 00:01:37,255
If I had that cup and I was Elvis
in a big car, that'd be fantastic!

32
00:01:38,487 --> 00:01:41,399
You've never had
much imagination, have you?

33
00:01:41,447 --> 00:01:43,244
You're right there, Ted.

34
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,074
OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN
from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn

35
00:02:08,047 --> 00:02:09,560
(Helicopter)

36
00:02:10,807 --> 00:02:12,001
(Crash)

37
00:02:17,607 --> 00:02:19,359
(Clock ticking)

38
00:02:39,887 --> 00:02:41,286
No, I'm fine.

39
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:50,560
Right.

40
00:02:51,567 --> 00:02:54,877
Uh… would you like me
to turn on the television?

41
00:02:56,287 --> 00:02:58,084
No, thanks. I'm fine.

42
00:02:59,487 --> 00:03:00,886
Right.

43
00:03:06,647 --> 00:03:09,764
Have you seen Father Shortall
at all recently?

44
00:03:10,807 --> 00:03:12,035
No.

45
00:03:13,687 --> 00:03:16,129
What would he be?
Would he be 80 now?

46
00:03:16,927 --> 00:03:18,121
Suppose so.

47
00:03:19,727 --> 00:03:24,083
Dougal, you wanted a word? Fair
enough. Won't be a moment, Father.

48
00:03:25,487 --> 00:03:27,398
What's up, Ted? Who's that?

49
00:03:27,447 --> 00:03:30,351
–I had to get out of there.
–Who is it, Ted?

50
00:03:31,247 --> 00:03:34,557
–Now, Dougal, don't overreact.
–Fair enough.

51
00:03:39,207 --> 00:03:40,606
Right…

52
00:03:41,687 --> 00:03:43,484
It's Father Stone.

53
00:03:45,087 --> 00:03:47,661
–Dougal, get up.
–Oh, Ted, no, not him.

54
00:03:47,687 --> 00:03:50,155
–It's him, all right.
–God Almighty!

55
00:03:50,207 --> 00:03:54,647
Why didn't you tell him not to come?
You promised after the last time!

56
00:03:54,687 --> 00:03:57,838
It's like talking to a wall
with a moustache.

57
00:03:57,887 --> 00:04:01,766
Oh, God, I hate it!
Those awful protracted silences.

58
00:04:01,807 --> 00:04:03,525
Why didn't you lie to him⁈

59
00:04:03,567 --> 00:04:06,207
I did!
I told him great big massive lies

60
00:04:06,247 --> 00:04:08,761
with feckin' bells hanging off them!

61
00:04:08,807 --> 00:04:10,957
It's like asking the Holy Mother

62
00:04:11,007 --> 00:04:14,716
to stop appearing
to schoolgirls at Ballnspittal.

63
00:04:14,767 --> 00:04:16,280
Oh, God.

64
00:04:16,327 --> 00:04:18,363
–Keep me company.
–No!

65
00:04:18,407 --> 00:04:19,840
–Dougal!
–No!

66
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:22,799
(Ted chuckling)

67
00:04:22,847 --> 00:04:24,326
Back again!

68
00:04:25,367 --> 00:04:27,562
Oh, sorry! You remember Dougal?

69
00:04:28,647 --> 00:04:29,716
Ah, yes.

70
00:04:29,767 --> 00:04:32,520
Yes, you've been coming…
how many years?

71
00:04:33,447 --> 00:04:35,324
–A few, anyway.
–Six!

72
00:04:35,367 --> 00:04:37,358
Six years.

73
00:04:38,327 --> 00:04:40,124
Every summer.

74
00:04:40,167 --> 00:04:43,000
So… what time
are you going back tomorrow?

75
00:04:43,047 --> 00:04:45,038
I might stay.

76
00:04:45,087 --> 00:04:46,805
What?

77
00:04:46,847 --> 00:04:49,805
–I say, I might stay.
–How long?

78
00:04:49,847 --> 00:04:52,520
I don't know. A few weeks, maybe.

79
00:04:53,527 --> 00:04:55,199
A few weeks?

80
00:04:55,247 --> 00:04:57,442
Sorry about that, Ted. Fell over.

81
00:04:58,527 --> 00:05:02,042
Tea, Fathers.
Anyone for a nice cup of…?

82
00:05:02,087 --> 00:05:04,317
Oh, no, it's Father Stone.

83
00:05:05,967 --> 00:05:08,805
Do you not have to get back
to your parish?

84
00:05:09,607 --> 00:05:11,484
No. Not for a while, anyway.

85
00:05:11,527 --> 00:05:13,245
(Chuckles nervously)

86
00:05:13,287 --> 00:05:16,643
Right, it's just that
there's a problem in that…

87
00:05:16,687 --> 00:05:20,441
Dougal and I were going
to do something. W-what was it?

88
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:23,763
–The thing there.
–Yes, what was the thing?

89
00:05:23,807 --> 00:05:25,684
–Yes!
–What was it?

90
00:05:25,727 --> 00:05:28,480
–Er, the thing, er…
–Big thing, it was.

91
00:05:28,527 --> 00:05:30,358
–Oh, er…
–Oh, er…

92
00:05:30,407 --> 00:05:33,638
Er… Holidays! (Laughs )

93
00:05:33,687 --> 00:05:35,678
We're going on holidays.

94
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:40,882
That's fine. I'll mind the place.

95
00:05:40,927 --> 00:05:45,876
Wait! It wasn't holidays, it was
something else we were doing…

96
00:05:45,927 --> 00:05:48,725
that means no one
can stay in the house…

97
00:05:48,767 --> 00:05:50,598
What was it? What was it?

98
00:05:50,647 --> 00:05:53,241
Um… We… we… were going to…

99
00:05:53,287 --> 00:05:55,847
–Dougal?
–Have the paintings re-hung!

100
00:05:55,887 --> 00:05:58,765
Oh, brilliant!
Brilliant memory there.

101
00:05:58,807 --> 00:06:01,087
Have you noticed?
They're all crooked.

102
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:04,047
–What type of an angle is that?
–It's a mad angle.

103
00:06:04,087 --> 00:06:05,805
You can't stay here.

104
00:06:05,847 --> 00:06:11,126
See? You couldn't be here when
people are shifting paintings around.

105
00:06:11,167 --> 00:06:13,158
So, where will you go?

106
00:06:14,447 --> 00:06:17,996
–Hotel, probably.
–That's fine. I'll go with you.

107
00:06:20,327 --> 00:06:24,221
Sorry, Paul, I just have
to sort something out with Dougal.

108
00:06:25,727 --> 00:06:28,844
God… God, think, Dougal, think!

109
00:06:28,887 --> 00:06:30,718
(Gasping and panting)

110
00:06:31,727 --> 00:06:33,877
All right, I'll do the thinking.

111
00:06:33,927 --> 00:06:35,883
Ted… Jack!

112
00:06:36,847 --> 00:06:38,200
Oh, God.

113
00:06:38,247 --> 00:06:39,566
If he sees him…

114
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:42,967
Christ Almighty,
I'll have to break it to him gently.

115
00:06:43,007 --> 00:06:48,604
–Look, you take Paul out and I'll…
–You're not leaving me with him.

116
00:06:48,647 --> 00:06:51,115
–Dougal!
–No, Ted, sorry about that.

117
00:06:51,167 --> 00:06:55,319
–I just can't. There's no way!
–Are YOU going to tell Jack?

118
00:06:56,327 --> 00:06:57,999
I'll get me coat.

119
00:06:59,007 --> 00:07:04,127
Paul, Dougal's going for a walk.
Would you like to join him?

120
00:07:04,167 --> 00:07:07,876
–No, I'm fine.
–Are you sure? It's lovely.

121
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,527
No, thanks, no. I'm fine.

122
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:11,807
Dougal wants to show you something.

123
00:07:11,847 --> 00:07:13,838
–It's very important.
–Is it?

124
00:07:13,887 --> 00:07:17,887
Yes, very important. Maybe the most
important thing you'll ever see.

125
00:07:17,927 --> 00:07:19,679
–Yeah?
–Yes.

126
00:07:20,967 --> 00:07:22,844
–Right.
–So you'll go?

127
00:07:22,887 --> 00:07:27,403
No, I'm fine, thanks.
I'll see it again sometime.

128
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:31,486
Well, to be honest,
it's not Dougal, it's that…

129
00:07:31,527 --> 00:07:34,629
there's a fire in the house,
you have to leave.

130
00:07:35,407 --> 00:07:37,204
–A fire?
–Yes.

131
00:07:37,247 --> 00:07:40,887
I didn't want to panic you.
It's small, but it could spread.

132
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:43,247
If you died,
I'd never forgive myself.

133
00:07:43,287 --> 00:07:45,847
You go with Dougal,
I'll fight the blaze.

134
00:07:45,887 --> 00:07:47,639
–Right so.
–You're going?

135
00:07:47,687 --> 00:07:51,475
–Well, yeah, if there's a fire.
–Great!

136
00:07:52,647 --> 00:07:56,117
Don't worry about me,
drop of water'll do the trick.

137
00:08:10,487 --> 00:08:15,083
So, have you seen
Father Shortall lately?

138
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:16,879
No.

139
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:24,364
I, uh… I suppose
he must be about 80 now?

140
00:08:26,927 --> 00:08:28,918
I suppose so.

141
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:36,763
Father…

142
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:38,923
Father, are you awake?

143
00:08:40,767 --> 00:08:42,519
Father…

144
00:08:45,727 --> 00:08:48,400
Father, we have a visitor.

145
00:08:51,127 --> 00:08:53,118
So, how's everything, then?

146
00:08:54,887 --> 00:08:56,479
All right.

147
00:08:57,927 --> 00:08:59,918
(Jack) Feck off!

148
00:09:01,767 --> 00:09:04,122
Bit of a back draught. Nearly out.

149
00:09:20,967 --> 00:09:22,958
Jack gone to bed, then, Ted?

150
00:09:23,007 --> 00:09:25,237
Yes, he was a little tired.

151
00:09:25,287 --> 00:09:27,084
(Muffled yells)

152
00:09:33,967 --> 00:09:37,642
Right. Well, I suppose my bath
will be ready by now.

153
00:09:50,447 --> 00:09:52,165
(Sighing) Oh, God.

154
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:16,765
Can I help you, Paul?

155
00:10:17,767 --> 00:10:19,519
No, fine.

156
00:10:21,327 --> 00:10:25,525
I'm, um… having a bath.

157
00:10:25,567 --> 00:10:27,927
It's just that
I wanted to go to the toilet.

158
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:31,357
Oh. Right, well, go ahead.

159
00:10:45,807 --> 00:10:47,399
(Farts )

160
00:10:56,167 --> 00:10:58,123
(Clock ticking)

161
00:11:03,967 --> 00:11:05,958
Ah, time for bed!

162
00:11:08,047 --> 00:11:09,605
It's only half-seven!

163
00:11:09,647 --> 00:11:13,401
Yes, but I have to be up
at 11 in the morning.

164
00:11:15,807 --> 00:11:18,605
Dougal, you'd better
get some rest, too.

165
00:11:27,087 --> 00:11:29,327
I can't take much more of this, Ted.

166
00:11:29,367 --> 00:11:31,244
I know, I know.

167
00:11:31,287 --> 00:11:35,207
Six years. You'd think that by now
he'd have got the message.

168
00:11:35,247 --> 00:11:38,922
Do you remember that time
we pretended to be in Rome?

169
00:11:38,967 --> 00:11:42,118
Ha. God, yeah, that was amazing.

170
00:11:42,167 --> 00:11:46,365
Anyone else would go “fair enough”
and just not turn up.

171
00:11:46,407 --> 00:11:49,126
But five days in the attic!

172
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:55,885
No food, no water.

173
00:11:55,927 --> 00:11:59,966
Rats everywhere…
If only we'd thought of it this year.

174
00:12:00,007 --> 00:12:02,647
How did you meet him
in the first place?

175
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:06,047
We were introduced
by Father Jim Doogan at a conference.

176
00:12:06,087 --> 00:12:09,207
Doogan came up and said,
“This is Father Stone,”

177
00:12:09,247 --> 00:12:11,095
and ran out of the building.

178
00:12:11,127 --> 00:12:13,687
Just ran straight out
of the building.

179
00:12:13,727 --> 00:12:15,524
So we start to talking.

180
00:12:15,567 --> 00:12:18,801
Well, I start to talking,
you know the way he is.

181
00:12:18,807 --> 00:12:22,687
To break the silence, I invited him
to stay. For something to say.

182
00:12:22,727 --> 00:12:26,879
The next day —the next day!—
he arrived on the island.

183
00:12:26,927 --> 00:12:28,967
God, if he'd only say something.

184
00:12:29,007 --> 00:12:32,007
But he just sits there.
What does he get out of it?

185
00:12:32,047 --> 00:12:35,287
I hope he's gone
before your birthday party, anyway.

186
00:12:35,327 --> 00:12:37,636
Ohh. He'll be long gone by then.

187
00:12:37,687 --> 00:12:39,757
What is it? Three weeks away?

188
00:12:57,927 --> 00:13:01,425
Good God, look at the time.
I'd better be going, Ted.

189
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,802
–Oh.
–Anyone need a lift?

190
00:13:06,887 --> 00:13:09,117
(Ted) Dougal…

191
00:13:14,287 --> 00:13:15,800
(Jack muttering)

192
00:13:19,767 --> 00:13:23,760
(Sobbing) Please, God, please!
Please get rid of him.

193
00:13:23,807 --> 00:13:27,766
I don't care how you do it,
just please get rid of him.

194
00:13:29,887 --> 00:13:33,596
Do you want money? Anything you want!

195
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:37,356
Name any charity.
But please get rid of him! (Sobbing)

196
00:13:49,567 --> 00:13:51,797
Maybe we should go home, Ted.

197
00:13:51,847 --> 00:13:54,839
Think about who's sitting
in the living room.

198
00:13:54,887 --> 00:13:57,481
Oh, yeah.
It's clearing up now, anyway.

199
00:13:57,527 --> 00:13:59,245
(Thunder)

200
00:14:00,647 --> 00:14:05,437
–Windmill thing's blown over there.
–Never mind, just have your go.

201
00:14:05,487 --> 00:14:09,241
–Golf, yeah?
–Oh, God. Ah, yeah.

202
00:14:09,287 --> 00:14:12,916
Crazy golf, Paul,
not exactly the US Masters.

203
00:14:12,967 --> 00:14:15,037
–No.
–Will you have a go, Paul?

204
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:17,727
–Oh, no.
–It's great fun, isn't it, Dougal?

205
00:14:17,767 --> 00:14:19,678
–Fantastic!
–Have a go.

206
00:14:19,727 --> 00:14:22,924
–No, no.
–It's easy now the windmill's gone.

207
00:14:22,967 --> 00:14:26,531
Here. Give it a go,
what's the worse thing can happen?

208
00:14:32,287 --> 00:14:34,801
Oh, God, Dougal. It's all my fault.

209
00:14:34,847 --> 00:14:36,200
Don't be silly, Ted.

210
00:14:36,247 --> 00:14:39,943
So what did you do,
pray for him to be hit by lightning?

211
00:14:40,767 --> 00:14:42,359
No, of course not. I…

212
00:14:42,407 --> 00:14:45,727
I asked Him to intervene in some way,
but this is a bit much.

213
00:14:45,767 --> 00:14:47,758
What are you thinking of?

214
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:52,007
Who'd have thought being hit by
lightning would land you in hospital?

215
00:14:52,047 --> 00:14:55,164
What? What?

216
00:14:55,207 --> 00:14:57,767
Of course it can land you
in hospital!

217
00:14:57,807 --> 00:15:00,447
Well, it's not usually serious,
is it, Ted?

218
00:15:00,487 --> 00:15:04,487
I was hit by lightning a few times,
I never had to go to hospital.

219
00:15:04,527 --> 00:15:07,647
Yes, Dougal, but you're different
from most people.

220
00:15:07,687 --> 00:15:11,680
All that happened to you
was balloons kept sticking to you.

221
00:15:14,927 --> 00:15:17,043
God, I hate hospitals.

222
00:15:17,087 --> 00:15:20,387
Ever notice it's usually
sick people in hospitals?

223
00:15:23,927 --> 00:15:27,442
Ah, yeah. Of course,
you're a goner when you walk in.

224
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:29,807
I'll take my chances
in the real world.

225
00:15:29,847 --> 00:15:31,767
I'd never go under the hammer.

226
00:15:31,807 --> 00:15:36,676
Under the knife, Dougal.
Under the hammer is auctioneering.

227
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:38,558
Oh, right, yeah.

228
00:15:38,607 --> 00:15:42,687
Remember that film where your
man's head is transplanted onto a fly

229
00:15:42,727 --> 00:15:45,647
and the fly's head
is transplanted onto the man?

230
00:15:45,687 --> 00:15:49,600
–Oh, yes. What was that called?
–Out of Africa, I think.

231
00:15:49,647 --> 00:15:52,525
You know,
your man has the head of a fly

232
00:15:52,567 --> 00:15:55,287
and he's chasing his wife
all over the place,

233
00:15:55,327 --> 00:15:59,843
she's trying to hide the jam
so as he won't get stuck in it…

234
00:15:59,887 --> 00:16:02,287
–I have to stop you there.
–Yes, Ted?

235
00:16:02,327 --> 00:16:04,637
No reason, I just have to stop you.

236
00:16:05,087 --> 00:16:07,043
There's today's emergency.

237
00:16:07,087 --> 00:16:08,918
What is it today, Doctor?

238
00:16:08,967 --> 00:16:13,279
We don't know. I think it's
a combination of Babycham and Harpic.

239
00:16:13,327 --> 00:16:16,558
Probably all that was left
after the party.

240
00:16:16,607 --> 00:16:20,566
Father Stone's been in a long time.
Do you think he's dead?

241
00:16:22,127 --> 00:16:25,881
–Probably doing tests.
–What sort? General knowledge?

242
00:16:27,607 --> 00:16:29,040
No.

243
00:16:29,087 --> 00:16:31,367
Won't get much from him
in that condition.

244
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:33,318
No. No, medical tests!

245
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:36,165
So what would he know
about that, Ted?

246
00:16:37,767 --> 00:16:39,758
(Jack screaming)

247
00:16:40,487 --> 00:16:43,843
There he goes.
He can move when he wants to.

248
00:16:43,887 --> 00:16:47,118
Stupid bastard!
You've really done it this time!

249
00:16:47,167 --> 00:16:48,839
You started it, you slag!

250
00:16:48,887 --> 00:16:51,447
The next time, I finish the job. I…

251
00:16:51,487 --> 00:16:52,840
Ah, Fathers.

252
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:54,684
Hello, John. Hello, Mary.

253
00:16:54,727 --> 00:16:58,402
Ah, hello. Well, uh…
What are you doing here, Father?

254
00:16:58,447 --> 00:17:01,007
Um… a friend of ours
had an accident.

255
00:17:01,047 --> 00:17:03,561
–Oh!
–What happened? That looks nasty.

256
00:17:03,607 --> 00:17:07,646
I'm sure it's nothing, Father.
It's just a… headache.

257
00:17:08,847 --> 00:17:11,157
I don't know why I bothered coming.

258
00:17:14,127 --> 00:17:15,276
Is that blood?

259
00:17:15,327 --> 00:17:17,636
Oh, God, no, no!

260
00:17:17,687 --> 00:17:19,325
I don't think so, uh…

261
00:17:19,367 --> 00:17:24,167
I just got a slight nick with a knife
when Mary was putting the bandage on.

262
00:17:24,207 --> 00:17:28,803
–It's, uh… it's not a stab wound.
–Sure, he's fine.

263
00:17:28,847 --> 00:17:31,167
You've been
in the wars yourself, Mary.

264
00:17:31,207 --> 00:17:33,647
It's only a sprain, Father,
it's nothing!

265
00:17:33,687 --> 00:17:36,207
I was lifting a bag of coal.
It's not broken.

266
00:17:36,247 --> 00:17:38,636
If it is, sure, what the hell⁈

267
00:17:38,687 --> 00:17:41,155
Well, I hope your friend gets better.

268
00:17:41,207 --> 00:17:43,767
(Mary ) Next time
I'll freaking make sure…

269
00:17:43,807 --> 00:17:45,240
Shut up, you bitch!

270
00:17:46,287 --> 00:17:49,006
They're a lovely couple,
John and Mary.

271
00:17:49,047 --> 00:17:50,605
Ah, they are all right.

272
00:17:50,647 --> 00:17:51,875
Ooh!

273
00:17:56,687 --> 00:17:59,567
How much longer
are they going to be in there?

274
00:17:59,607 --> 00:18:03,646
Ted, we hardly even know him.
Does he have much of a family?

275
00:18:03,687 --> 00:18:06,201
Yes, his parents are alive.

276
00:18:06,247 --> 00:18:09,762
And… he has a brother, I think.
A doctor in America.

277
00:18:09,807 --> 00:18:11,206
A doctor, wow.

278
00:18:11,247 --> 00:18:14,167
Hard to believe.
But that used to be quite common.

279
00:18:14,207 --> 00:18:16,567
The favourite son
would become a doctor.

280
00:18:16,607 --> 00:18:19,807
The idiot brother'd be
sent off to the priesthood.

281
00:18:19,847 --> 00:18:22,998
–Your brother's a doctor, isn't he?
–Yes.

282
00:18:24,047 --> 00:18:28,484
–Ah! Doctor, how's the patient?
–Hanging in there. Mostly shock.

283
00:18:28,527 --> 00:18:30,967
–That's not serious.
–It's quite serious.

284
00:18:31,007 --> 00:18:33,687
–Lightning can do a lot of damage.
–Can it?

285
00:18:33,727 --> 00:18:36,767
Yes. His reactions are very poor
at the moment.

286
00:18:36,807 --> 00:18:39,887
He's always had very poor reactions.
That's normal.

287
00:18:39,927 --> 00:18:43,127
Actually, he's not reacting at all
to any stimulus.

288
00:18:43,167 --> 00:18:45,927
Again, I wouldn't worry.
That's always the way.

289
00:18:45,967 --> 00:18:47,687
Look, Father, I'm a doctor,

290
00:18:47,727 --> 00:18:51,167
and I know it's not normal
to fail to react to stimulus.

291
00:18:51,207 --> 00:18:53,517
I'm sure it is. Look, look at this.

292
00:18:55,207 --> 00:18:57,047
You see? It's a priest thing.

293
00:18:57,087 --> 00:18:59,727
We have our minds
on more spiritual matters.

294
00:18:59,767 --> 00:19:01,758
So I wouldn't worry about it.

295
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:05,117
Well, no,
I think I WILL worry about it.

296
00:19:05,167 --> 00:19:07,158
Oh, God, OK.

297
00:19:07,207 --> 00:19:09,647
Can we see him?
I'd like to say a prayer.

298
00:19:09,687 --> 00:19:11,996
Yes, all right, Father. This way.

299
00:19:16,647 --> 00:19:21,437
As you can see, we still haven't been
able to remove the golf club.

300
00:19:21,487 --> 00:19:23,205
Why isn't he in bed?

301
00:19:23,247 --> 00:19:27,081
It's hard to get him comfortable
when he's in that stance.

302
00:19:27,127 --> 00:19:30,127
But you're right.
He's been on his feet long enough.

303
00:19:30,167 --> 00:19:32,203
He looks like a trophy.

304
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:34,566
He does, a bit.

305
00:19:34,607 --> 00:19:36,598
Sorry, I only just heard.

306
00:19:36,647 --> 00:19:38,763
Paul! Oh!

307
00:19:38,807 --> 00:19:41,687
Come on, Mrs Stone,
we've got to get him into bed.

308
00:19:41,727 --> 00:19:43,718
Father, would you?

309
00:19:45,807 --> 00:19:49,163
–You must be Father Crilly.
–Yes, I am.

310
00:19:49,207 --> 00:19:52,802
Oh, God bless you, Father,
God bless you.

311
00:19:52,847 --> 00:19:55,315
–Ahem.
–This is my husband, Dermot.

312
00:19:55,367 --> 00:19:58,439
Oh, God, it's terrible, Father,
it's terrible!

313
00:19:58,487 --> 00:20:01,487
God forgive me
for using the Lord's name in vain,

314
00:20:01,527 --> 00:20:03,687
but Jesus Christ, isn't it terrible?

315
00:20:03,727 --> 00:20:05,407
–It is.
–Oh, it is, Father.

316
00:20:05,447 --> 00:20:09,247
It's terrible, terrible. I couldn't
have said it better meself.

317
00:20:09,287 --> 00:20:11,333
Terrible is the word. Terrible!

318
00:20:11,367 --> 00:20:14,120
I tell you,
terrible's too small a word.

319
00:20:14,167 --> 00:20:16,967
Oh, God, Father, it is,
it's too small a word.

320
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:20,287
Look what you're doing to
your mother, you lazy bastard!

321
00:20:20,327 --> 00:20:22,318
You're useless! Get up!

322
00:20:22,367 --> 00:20:25,803
–Mr Stone…
–I'm sorry, him causing you trouble.

323
00:20:25,847 --> 00:20:27,687
God forgive me for saying this,

324
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:30,763
but it'd have been better
if he'd been killed.

325
00:20:31,967 --> 00:20:34,162
And herself all upset.

326
00:20:34,207 --> 00:20:36,167
Jesus, what you must think of him.

327
00:20:36,207 --> 00:20:38,607
And us, for bringing him
into the world.

328
00:20:38,647 --> 00:20:41,407
–Mr Stone…
–I'm for a drink, will you join me?

329
00:20:41,447 --> 00:20:43,691
No, I'll stay here for the moment.

330
00:20:43,727 --> 00:20:46,103
I'm off, then. See you later, right.

331
00:20:46,127 --> 00:20:48,561
–And this is Mummy.
–Hello.

332
00:20:52,247 --> 00:20:54,602
I know what you're up to!

333
00:20:54,647 --> 00:20:59,767
God. You know, Father,
Paul thinks the world of you.

334
00:20:59,807 --> 00:21:03,436
Oh, indeed he does.
He never stops talking about you.

335
00:21:03,487 --> 00:21:07,082
Father Ted says this,
Father Ted says that…

336
00:21:07,127 --> 00:21:10,199
–He worships you, Father.
–Really?

337
00:21:10,247 --> 00:21:14,167
He leaves Craggy Island counting
the days till he can go back again.

338
00:21:14,207 --> 00:21:15,606
Literally! Look!

339
00:21:18,047 --> 00:21:19,241
He has a chart.

340
00:21:19,287 --> 00:21:22,643
And he crosses off the days
as they pass by.

341
00:21:22,687 --> 00:21:25,485
And right down
at the bottom of the chart,

342
00:21:25,527 --> 00:21:27,245
a photograph of yourself.

343
00:21:27,287 --> 00:21:28,640
Oh, God.

344
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:31,247
And he does paintings as well.

345
00:21:31,287 --> 00:21:33,198
He did this one for you.

346
00:21:37,047 --> 00:21:39,436
–(Beeping)
–Oh, Lord. Oh, God!

347
00:21:39,487 --> 00:21:41,478
–What is it?
–It's his heart!

348
00:21:41,527 --> 00:21:43,358
Do something!

349
00:21:43,407 --> 00:21:44,681
Oh! Oh!

350
00:21:44,727 --> 00:21:47,287
Oh, Dougal, Dou… Dou…

351
00:21:48,247 --> 00:21:49,885
(Beeping stops )

352
00:21:51,207 --> 00:21:53,846
–Dougal!
–Mrs Stone, come with me.

353
00:21:53,887 --> 00:21:56,927
–I need you to fill out some forms.
–Will he be OK?

354
00:21:56,967 --> 00:21:59,607
We're doing all we can,
but he is quite ill.

355
00:21:59,647 --> 00:22:02,407
–Just hope for the best.
–All right, Doctor.

356
00:22:02,447 --> 00:22:04,677
Come on, Mummy.

357
00:22:07,927 --> 00:22:10,167
The old woman knows
it's all my fault.

358
00:22:10,207 --> 00:22:11,567
How would she know that?

359
00:22:11,607 --> 00:22:15,207
They have ways. Old women are
closer to God than we'll ever be.

360
00:22:15,247 --> 00:22:19,527
They don't need the operator any
more, they've got the direct line.

361
00:22:19,567 --> 00:22:21,000
She knows, all right.

362
00:22:21,047 --> 00:22:23,887
Who could blame her for being angry?
It's my fault!

363
00:22:23,927 --> 00:22:25,883
Why did I do it? Oh, God!

364
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:27,519
Please!

365
00:22:27,567 --> 00:22:30,727
Bring him back.
I never meant you to take him away.

366
00:22:30,767 --> 00:22:32,887
There was no need for the lightning.

367
00:22:32,927 --> 00:22:36,007
You know I didn't mean that.
That was just silly.

368
00:22:36,047 --> 00:22:38,527
Please, God.
Bring him back and I swear…

369
00:22:38,567 --> 00:22:41,607
We'll look after him.
He can stay as long as he wants!

370
00:22:41,647 --> 00:22:43,603
–Now, Ted…
–Shut up, Dougal!

371
00:22:44,887 --> 00:22:48,727
Please! I swear, I'll look after him
for the rest of my days.

372
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:51,122
Please just do this one thing.

373
00:22:52,527 --> 00:22:55,963
Ah, come on. Please!
Please, I swear…

374
00:22:56,007 --> 00:22:57,645
(Fanfare )

375
00:22:58,807 --> 00:23:03,005
Paul! You're back!
Oh, Lord, it's a miracle!

376
00:23:03,047 --> 00:23:04,241
Doctor!

377
00:23:04,287 --> 00:23:07,836
Paul, can I get you anything at all?

378
00:23:08,567 --> 00:23:10,558
No, I'm fine.

379
00:23:13,407 --> 00:23:15,363
(Clock ticking)

379
00:23:16,305 --> 00:24:16,404
