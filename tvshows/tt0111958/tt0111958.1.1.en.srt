00:00:25,807 --> 00:00:27,240
(Helicopter)

3
00:00:28,607 --> 00:00:29,756
(Crash)

4
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:36,881
Right. That's Tuesday dealt with.

5
00:00:36,927 --> 00:00:38,775
Let's look at Wednesday now.

6
00:00:38,807 --> 00:00:42,766
Uh… Half-seven Mass.

7
00:00:42,807 --> 00:00:45,196
I can take that.

8
00:00:45,247 --> 00:00:47,761
And, uh… maybe…

9
00:00:47,807 --> 00:00:50,447
Could you take
the eight o'clock at all?

10
00:00:52,647 --> 00:00:54,693
Right, I can take that as well.

11
00:00:55,727 --> 00:00:59,436
Now, um…
the half-six evening Mass on Sunday.

12
00:00:59,487 --> 00:01:01,557
Evening Mass?

13
00:01:03,087 --> 00:01:04,281
Too early.

14
00:01:04,327 --> 00:01:07,607
No problem, I can take that as well,
I'll just make a note.

15
00:01:07,647 --> 00:01:10,002
–Morning, Ted.
–Morning, Dougal.

16
00:01:12,127 --> 00:01:14,163
Uh, Dougal? There's, uh…

17
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:16,487
There's some shaving cream
just there.

18
00:01:16,527 --> 00:01:18,916
No, there's not, Ted. You're grand.

19
00:01:20,727 --> 00:01:23,036
–No, on you.
–Oh, where, exactly?

20
00:01:23,087 --> 00:01:25,681
–Just there, below your ear.
–Here?

21
00:01:25,727 --> 00:01:28,480
Yes, and there's a bit more…

22
00:01:28,527 --> 00:01:30,961
–Gone?
–No, there's still just a…

23
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:32,645
It's all over the place.

24
00:01:34,887 --> 00:01:37,527
Oh, God. How on earth
did all that get there?

25
00:01:37,567 --> 00:01:39,797
I didn't even shave this morning.

26
00:01:43,967 --> 00:01:46,145
So, what are we doing today, Ted?

27
00:01:46,167 --> 00:01:48,345
Confessions and things like that?

28
00:01:48,367 --> 00:01:50,483
Yes, Dougal, things like that.

29
00:01:52,687 --> 00:01:55,838
It's great being a priest,
isn't it, Ted?

30
00:01:59,167 --> 00:02:00,600
God, it's lovely out.

31
00:02:04,287 --> 00:02:05,847
Oh, wait till I tell you, Ted!

32
00:02:05,887 --> 00:02:08,807
Funland's coming to Craggy Island
on Saturday.

33
00:02:08,847 --> 00:02:10,838
Oh, yes, the fairground thing.

34
00:02:10,887 --> 00:02:14,781
I wouldn't have much interest
in that type of thing myself.

35
00:02:14,807 --> 00:02:17,002
They've got a spider baby.

36
00:02:18,527 --> 00:02:20,199
–A what?
–A spider baby.

37
00:02:20,247 --> 00:02:21,600
A freak show thing.

38
00:02:21,647 --> 00:02:24,887
It's got the body of a spider
but it's actually a baby.

39
00:02:24,927 --> 00:02:26,326
Oh.

40
00:02:29,767 --> 00:02:33,397
How is it a baby?
Does it have a nappy on or something?

41
00:02:34,967 --> 00:02:36,241
No.

42
00:02:36,287 --> 00:02:38,517
Does it have the head of a baby?

43
00:02:40,647 --> 00:02:42,160
Um…

44
00:02:42,207 --> 00:02:43,196
No.

45
00:02:44,687 --> 00:02:49,043
Well, if it looks like a spider
and it doesn't gurgle or anything,

46
00:02:49,047 --> 00:02:50,895
how do you know it's a baby?

47
00:02:51,887 --> 00:02:53,878
They keep it in a pram.

48
00:02:56,967 --> 00:03:00,164
Dougal,
are you absolutely sure about this?

49
00:03:00,207 --> 00:03:03,441
You're not confusing it
with a dream or anything?

50
00:03:03,487 --> 00:03:07,645
No, honestly, I saw it on the news.
Honestly! Oh… Oh, wait now.

51
00:03:07,647 --> 00:03:11,083
Actually, now that you say it,
it was a dream, yeah.

52
00:03:12,607 --> 00:03:15,247
Have you been studying this
like I told you?

53
00:03:15,287 --> 00:03:17,482
Oh, I have, Ted.

54
00:03:17,527 --> 00:03:21,156
Sorry. But we should go anyway, Ted,
it'll be great!

55
00:03:21,207 --> 00:03:24,367
Last year I did horse riding
and it was just fantastic.

56
00:03:24,407 --> 00:03:26,207
I didn't know you rode horses.

57
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:29,603
Well, it wasn't a real horse,
Ted, like…

58
00:03:29,647 --> 00:03:32,551
It was this old fellow
with a saddle on him.

59
00:03:36,167 --> 00:03:38,397
God, he must've been about 80.

60
00:03:38,447 --> 00:03:40,836
Of course, he couldn't go very fast.

61
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:43,767
I was kind of lashing him
with the whip and all…

62
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:45,687
Couldn't get much of a response.

63
00:03:45,727 --> 00:03:48,366
And how long were you up on him?

64
00:03:48,407 --> 00:03:50,557
Oh, I'd say it was about, uh…

65
00:03:52,087 --> 00:03:54,123
about an hour?

66
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:57,318
So you were up on
an 80-year-old man,

67
00:03:57,367 --> 00:04:00,527
riding him around and whipping him
for 60 minutes?

68
00:04:00,567 --> 00:04:04,447
You realise that image will
stay with me for the rest of my life?

69
00:04:04,487 --> 00:04:08,275
I know, Ted. It's great, isn't it?
Come on, we should go.

70
00:04:08,327 --> 00:04:11,807
No, I don't think I could
take the excitement, to be honest.

71
00:04:11,847 --> 00:04:15,279
Suppose I'll just see if there's
anything on the TV.

72
00:04:18,727 --> 00:04:22,007
<i>–What type of a jumper is that?
–Well, basically…</i>

73
00:04:22,047 --> 00:04:23,275
Ahh!

74
00:04:26,247 --> 00:04:28,203
(Sizzling)

75
00:04:33,447 --> 00:04:36,367
Maybe I'll just go and study
the old diagram.

76
00:04:36,407 --> 00:04:37,920
(Phone )

77
00:04:40,207 --> 00:04:42,407
Hello? Father Ted Crilly speaking.

78
00:04:42,447 --> 00:04:46,725
Hello, Father. Sorry to disturb you.
My name is Terry MacNamee.

79
00:04:46,767 --> 00:04:50,555
I'm producing Faith of Our Fathers
for Telly Eireann.

80
00:04:50,607 --> 00:04:54,247
We're talking to priests
who work in isolated communities.

81
00:04:54,287 --> 00:04:55,879
Would you be interested?

82
00:04:55,927 --> 00:04:59,476
Well, that's very, um…
That's very exciting.

83
00:04:59,527 --> 00:05:02,447
Faith of Our Fathers
is my favourite programme.

84
00:05:02,487 --> 00:05:05,327
Well, you were the first person
we thought of.

85
00:05:05,367 --> 00:05:07,887
If you are interested,
I could come over.

86
00:05:07,927 --> 00:05:09,643
We'd give you a small fee.

87
00:05:09,647 --> 00:05:12,161
–Who's that, Ted?
–Uh, no one.

88
00:05:12,207 --> 00:05:14,607
–No one?
<i>–Hello, Father Crilly?</i>

89
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:16,558
–No.
–Must be someone, Ted.

90
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:18,404
Just a moment.

91
00:05:22,287 --> 00:05:23,515
Sorry.

92
00:05:23,567 --> 00:05:26,047
How exactly do you get to
Craggy Island?

93
00:05:26,087 --> 00:05:28,087
It doesn't seem to be on any maps.

94
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:32,047
No, it wouldn't be on any maps, now.
We're not exactly New York.

95
00:05:32,087 --> 00:05:35,204
The best way is
from Galway, go slightly north

96
00:05:35,247 --> 00:05:38,647
till you see the English boats
with the nuclear symbol.

97
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:43,078
They go very close to the island
dumping the old glow-in-the-dark.

98
00:05:43,127 --> 00:05:47,647
Are there any other priests living
with you? We don't list anyone else.

99
00:05:47,687 --> 00:05:50,520
Um… well, uh…

100
00:05:50,567 --> 00:05:52,762
No, there's no one else here.

101
00:05:52,807 --> 00:05:56,087
I'll see you on Saturday.
I'll call when I get there.

102
00:05:56,127 --> 00:05:57,526
Bye.

103
00:06:00,567 --> 00:06:02,842
(Burps )

104
00:06:17,167 --> 00:06:18,759
The ants are back, Ted.

105
00:06:20,607 --> 00:06:24,447
Never turn on the TV when Father
Jack's asleep. You know how he is!

106
00:06:24,487 --> 00:06:26,717
But he's always asleep.

107
00:06:26,767 --> 00:06:30,487
Anyone who's served the Church
as long as he has deserves a rest.

108
00:06:30,527 --> 00:06:31,721
(Snoring)

109
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:34,767
It's an honour for us
to look after him in his old age.

110
00:06:34,807 --> 00:06:36,684
(Muttering)

111
00:06:37,727 --> 00:06:40,958
Look at him,
dreaming of past glories, no doubt.

112
00:06:41,007 --> 00:06:42,759
(Angelic choir)

113
00:06:42,807 --> 00:06:45,321
Girls, pay attention.

114
00:06:45,367 --> 00:06:47,479
We've got a special treat today.

115
00:06:47,487 --> 00:06:52,173
Father Hackett has volunteered to
take you all for volleyball practice.

116
00:06:53,167 --> 00:06:54,600
Right, Father.

117
00:06:54,647 --> 00:06:57,161
He's just reminded me
it's very warm,

118
00:06:57,207 --> 00:06:59,517
so no need for your tracksuit tops.

119
00:07:02,767 --> 00:07:04,280
(Angelic choir)

120
00:07:12,047 --> 00:07:13,878
Hello!

121
00:07:14,927 --> 00:07:16,838
Father Dougal McGuire here.

122
00:07:16,887 --> 00:07:20,118
And welcome to this week's
Top of the Pops.

123
00:07:20,167 --> 00:07:21,607
In at number 45 this week

124
00:07:21,647 --> 00:07:24,407
is Father Ted Crilly
with I've Got the Power.

125
00:07:24,447 --> 00:07:29,760
And at number 15 for the 16th week
in a row is Father Jack Hackett,

126
00:07:29,807 --> 00:07:31,327
with I'm a Sleepy Priest.

127
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:34,484
How did that gobshite
get on the television⁈

128
00:07:37,487 --> 00:07:39,876
Hello to you all.

129
00:07:39,927 --> 00:07:42,964
Ah, is the television
broken again, Father?

130
00:07:43,007 --> 00:07:45,647
–Yes, we…
–There's nothing wrong with it

131
00:07:45,687 --> 00:07:50,966
that can't be fixed with a bit of
you know what in the head department.

132
00:07:51,007 --> 00:07:52,759
Now, then, who's for tea?

133
00:07:52,807 --> 00:07:55,924
–Me, please, Mrs Doyle.
–Tea? Feck!

134
00:07:57,167 --> 00:07:59,927
–I'm fine, Mrs Doyle.
–You won't have a cup?

135
00:07:59,967 --> 00:08:02,367
No thanks, Mrs Doyle.
I won't have a cup.

136
00:08:02,407 --> 00:08:05,247
–You sure? It's hot.
–No, I'm not in the mood.

137
00:08:05,287 --> 00:08:08,047
All right, so…
Aw, would you not have a drop?

138
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:10,007
–No, thanks.
–Just a little cup.

139
00:08:10,047 --> 00:08:12,287
–I'm fine!
–I tell you what, Father…

140
00:08:12,327 --> 00:08:14,647
–Seriously!
–I'll pour a cup anyway.

141
00:08:14,687 --> 00:08:17,963
And you can have it if you want.
Now…

142
00:08:19,527 --> 00:08:21,722
And what do you say to a cup?

143
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:23,598
Feck off, cup!

144
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:28,204
–He loves his cup of tea.
–Feck off!

145
00:08:28,247 --> 00:08:29,680
There you go.

146
00:08:29,727 --> 00:08:31,126
Feck off!

147
00:08:31,167 --> 00:08:33,283
Father Crilly, I nearly forgot.

148
00:08:33,327 --> 00:08:36,922
–Earlier, a Terry MacNamee called.
–Oh, right.

149
00:08:36,967 --> 00:08:38,967
–Who's that?
–Never heard of him.

150
00:08:39,007 --> 00:08:41,601
Something to do with the television?

151
00:08:41,647 --> 00:08:43,239
He's coming to fix it.

152
00:08:43,287 --> 00:08:46,085
–He'll be here tomorrow at 12.
–Grand.

153
00:08:50,607 --> 00:08:53,485
Yeah, it's good you
called someone, Ted.

154
00:08:55,567 --> 00:08:57,205
It's still not working.

155
00:08:59,767 --> 00:09:02,201
♫ You're simply the best

156
00:09:02,247 --> 00:09:03,760
♫ Doo doo doo doo

157
00:09:03,807 --> 00:09:06,799
♫ Better than all the rest,
doo doo doo doo ♫

158
00:09:06,847 --> 00:09:08,041
Ahem.

159
00:09:08,087 --> 00:09:10,167
You frightened the life out of me.

160
00:09:10,207 --> 00:09:12,641
You're doing the old pop star thing.

161
00:09:12,687 --> 00:09:14,723
I was, Ted, yeah.

162
00:09:15,767 --> 00:09:19,327
It was great being on TV today.
I've caught the telly bug.

163
00:09:19,367 --> 00:09:21,198
Well…

164
00:09:21,247 --> 00:09:25,735
Get to bed now and get some sleep,
you don't want to get over-tired.

165
00:09:30,087 --> 00:09:32,447
Did you ever want
to get into television?

166
00:09:32,487 --> 00:09:36,844
Ah, no, I… I wouldn't be interested
in that kind of thing, really.

167
00:09:36,887 --> 00:09:40,323
Right. You wouldn't be
much good at it, actually.

168
00:09:40,367 --> 00:09:41,925
What? Why not?

169
00:09:41,967 --> 00:09:45,927
Well, you're a bit serious.
And your eyes are a bit crossed.

170
00:09:47,487 --> 00:09:49,927
They're a bit wonky.
The cameras notice.

171
00:09:49,967 --> 00:09:52,356
I am not cross-eyed, Dougal.

172
00:09:52,407 --> 00:09:53,967
Ah, you're a bit, now, Ted.

173
00:09:54,007 --> 00:09:57,807
Half the time I don't know if
you're talking to me or Father Jack.

174
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:00,685
Dougal, why don't you just…
get some sleep.

175
00:10:00,727 --> 00:10:03,367
Right. Just have to say
the old prayers.

176
00:10:08,847 --> 00:10:10,997
Our Father, who art in heaven…

177
00:10:15,207 --> 00:10:17,482
(Ted) Hallowed.

178
00:10:17,527 --> 00:10:20,200
Hallowed be thy…

179
00:10:21,407 --> 00:10:22,476
(Ted) Name.

180
00:10:22,527 --> 00:10:25,963
Ah, Papa don't preach…

181
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:30,927
Dougal, you know you can praise God
with sleep.

182
00:10:30,967 --> 00:10:32,161
Can you, Ted?

183
00:10:32,207 --> 00:10:35,597
Yes, it's a way of thanking him
for a tiring day.

184
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:39,207
God. There's lots of ways
to praise God, isn't there, Ted?

185
00:10:39,247 --> 00:10:43,327
Like that time you told me to praise
him by just leaving the room.

186
00:10:43,367 --> 00:10:45,597
That was a good one, yes.

187
00:10:53,087 --> 00:10:55,317
–Ted…
–Mmm?

188
00:10:55,367 --> 00:10:58,916
–Ted?
–Yes?

189
00:10:58,967 --> 00:11:01,162
(Dougal) Knock knock.

190
00:11:03,647 --> 00:11:07,686
–Who's there?
–Father Dougal McGuire.

191
00:11:07,727 --> 00:11:09,877
Good night, Dougal.

192
00:11:14,087 --> 00:11:17,915
(Ted, quietly) I can hear you
a bit better now, shh, yeah.

193
00:11:19,767 --> 00:11:20,995
You made it, then?

194
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:24,567
I think so. There's no indication
it is Craggy Island.

195
00:11:24,607 --> 00:11:26,521
There's no signs or anything.

196
00:11:26,527 --> 00:11:30,751
Is there a man looking at you with
a T-shirt saying “I Shot JR”?

197
00:11:34,127 --> 00:11:36,197
Actually, there is.

198
00:11:36,247 --> 00:11:38,522
Ah, you're here, so, yeah.

199
00:11:38,567 --> 00:11:41,247
What? The line is bad,
you're a bit muffled.

200
00:11:41,287 --> 00:11:44,916
I'm on a portable phone,
you caught me by surprise.

201
00:11:44,967 --> 00:11:47,037
I'm on the toilet.

202
00:11:48,047 --> 00:11:51,244
Right. So, er…
So where can we meet?

203
00:11:51,287 --> 00:11:54,967
Anywhere we can get a few good shots?
Any local landmarks?

204
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,406
–No.
–What?

205
00:11:56,447 --> 00:11:58,559
There are no landmarks here now.

206
00:11:58,567 --> 00:12:00,046
None at all?

207
00:12:00,087 --> 00:12:04,127
No, the island itself is a kind
of landmark. For ships and that.

208
00:12:04,167 --> 00:12:07,995
Head away from it and
you're going in the right direction.

209
00:12:08,007 --> 00:12:10,202
–So, uh…
–There's the field.

210
00:12:10,247 --> 00:12:13,284
Oh, a field. Well, that sounds…

211
00:12:13,327 --> 00:12:16,567
It's not a field, really, but it has
less rocks than most places.

212
00:12:16,607 --> 00:12:20,247
Never mind. I'll meet you
at the field. How do I get there?

213
00:12:20,287 --> 00:12:22,287
Ask Tom there. He'll help you out.

214
00:12:22,327 --> 00:12:24,716
Right, Father. Thanks.

215
00:12:29,487 --> 00:12:31,125
Bird!

216
00:12:34,567 --> 00:12:36,797
(Dougal) Ooooo.

217
00:12:37,847 --> 00:12:39,803
Holy Mary Mother of God!

218
00:12:44,487 --> 00:12:47,797
God, Ted, I'm so sorry.
It was just a joke.

219
00:12:47,847 --> 00:12:51,203
Tr… try to avoid doing that again,
Dougal.

220
00:12:51,247 --> 00:12:53,636
I thought it was really… Herself.

221
00:12:55,287 --> 00:12:59,200
–That's the last thing I need.
–You're right there, Ted.

222
00:13:00,247 --> 00:13:04,447
Anyway, it's time for Jack's walk.
Time for your walk, Father Jack!

223
00:13:04,487 --> 00:13:06,682
(Mumbling)

224
00:13:06,727 --> 00:13:08,763
Off around the cliffs.

225
00:13:08,807 --> 00:13:11,607
Can I bring him to Funland, Ted?
He'd love that.

226
00:13:11,647 --> 00:13:14,719
No, he wouldn't.
Take him around the cliffs.

227
00:13:14,767 --> 00:13:17,527
This time, near the edge,
put on the brakes.

228
00:13:17,567 --> 00:13:19,247
He was lucky the last time.

229
00:13:19,287 --> 00:13:22,962
Right, Ted.
Um, you're not coming yourself?

230
00:13:23,007 --> 00:13:26,439
Ah, no, I think I'll stay here
and pray for a while.

231
00:13:28,367 --> 00:13:30,562
Oh, ho, what are you after, Ted?

232
00:13:30,607 --> 00:13:32,723
I'm not after anything, Dougal.

233
00:13:32,767 --> 00:13:37,207
It's not unknown for members of
the clergy to pray from time to time.

234
00:13:37,247 --> 00:13:39,761
Here we are, Father Crilly.

235
00:13:39,807 --> 00:13:40,922
Get away!

236
00:13:40,967 --> 00:13:45,245
There's nothing Father Hackett
likes more than some fresh air!

237
00:13:45,287 --> 00:13:46,959
–Come on.
–Oh, yeah.

238
00:13:47,007 --> 00:13:49,077
That's it.

239
00:13:50,487 --> 00:13:53,445
–Yeah, yeah, no…
–Ahh!

240
00:13:55,287 --> 00:13:56,607
(Shouting gibberish)

241
00:13:56,647 --> 00:13:57,841
Come on, Father.

242
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:01,243
(Confused shouting)

243
00:14:01,287 --> 00:14:04,279
Oh, now, come on, Father Hackett.

244
00:14:04,327 --> 00:14:07,364
That's it, now, in you go.
Isn't that better?

245
00:14:07,407 --> 00:14:10,479
–Good man.
–This'll keep you nice and warm.

246
00:14:10,527 --> 00:14:14,315
(Mrs Doyle ) Are you all right? Ooh.

247
00:14:21,487 --> 00:14:23,125
(Mumbling)

248
00:14:23,167 --> 00:14:26,477
Bye, then!
Every single day the same thing.

249
00:14:26,527 --> 00:14:29,887
Once he's out, he has a great time.
He loves them old cliffs.

250
00:14:29,927 --> 00:14:34,207
–I'll be off. What are you up to?
–I'll just have a bit of a pray.

251
00:14:34,247 --> 00:14:37,364
All right.
Enjoy the rest of the weekend.

252
00:15:00,127 --> 00:15:04,359
<i>Patrons are reminded
that parking is unavailable.</i>

253
00:15:04,407 --> 00:15:08,287
<i>A reminder of the unavailability
of parking facilities.</i>

254
00:15:08,327 --> 00:15:11,127
I didn't know
this bloody thing was on here.

255
00:15:11,167 --> 00:15:12,646
Hello, Father.

256
00:15:12,687 --> 00:15:15,487
Hello, Tom. Telly Eireann
lads get here all right?

257
00:15:15,527 --> 00:15:18,247
They've gone to film
a bit of the island first.

258
00:15:18,287 --> 00:15:21,167
–They'll be back soon.
–I'll wait in the field.

259
00:15:21,207 --> 00:15:23,323
–Father!
–Yes, Tom?

260
00:15:23,367 --> 00:15:24,720
I've killed a man.

261
00:15:24,767 --> 00:15:29,057
Did you? We'll talk later, I'm doing
an interview for television.

262
00:15:30,887 --> 00:15:35,005
<i>Α little boy has been lost.
Thank you.</i>

263
00:15:41,247 --> 00:15:44,000
Keep your hands on the sides!

264
00:15:44,047 --> 00:15:47,323
<i>The child has now been found,
thank you.</i>

265
00:15:47,367 --> 00:15:49,323
You fat, smelly cow!

266
00:15:49,367 --> 00:15:52,127
Take this. You have a face
like a pair of tits.

267
00:15:52,167 --> 00:15:54,939
Well, at least that's one pair
between us!

268
00:15:56,807 --> 00:15:59,765
–Hello, Mary.
–Ah, hello, Father.

269
00:15:59,807 --> 00:16:02,127
–Hello, John.
–Pack of Toffos, Father?

270
00:16:02,167 --> 00:16:06,527
No, thanks. I have to meet someone.
I'm to be interviewed for television.

271
00:16:06,567 --> 00:16:08,922
–Oh.
–Really? That's fantastic.

272
00:16:08,967 --> 00:16:12,861
You know, Father, I think you'd be
brilliant on television.

273
00:16:12,887 --> 00:16:14,002
Well, thank you.

274
00:16:14,047 --> 00:16:17,647
You'll be more than a match for Gay
Byrne or Terry Wogan or any of them.

275
00:16:17,687 --> 00:16:20,261
It'll take weeks
to get to their level.

276
00:16:21,287 --> 00:16:23,607
But I have to go find this film unit.

277
00:16:23,647 --> 00:16:27,687
They probably want to do a few
close-ups and master shots and that.

278
00:16:27,727 --> 00:16:31,527
Don't want to be late and get a
reputation as a Marilyn Monroe type.

279
00:16:31,567 --> 00:16:34,445
–See you soon.
–Good luck, Father Ted.

280
00:16:35,527 --> 00:16:39,281
–Get them fecking Crunchies out.
–Feck off.

281
00:16:39,327 --> 00:16:41,477
(Guitar strumming)

282
00:16:41,527 --> 00:16:43,518
(Banjo repeats guitar phrase )

283
00:16:47,087 --> 00:16:48,964
(Banjo imitates guitar)

284
00:16:50,167 --> 00:16:52,283
(Duelling Banjos theme )

285
00:16:57,367 --> 00:17:01,326
Ted! Ted! Over here, Ted!
Come here and look at me!

286
00:17:01,367 --> 00:17:04,359
Hey, Ted! What are you doing here?

287
00:17:04,407 --> 00:17:07,647
I thought you weren't interested
in this type of thing.

288
00:17:07,687 --> 00:17:10,367
You're supposed to be taking Jack
for his walk.

289
00:17:10,407 --> 00:17:13,127
Well, um…
The cliffs were closed for the day.

290
00:17:13,167 --> 00:17:15,681
How could cliffs be closed, Dougal?

291
00:17:15,727 --> 00:17:17,445
OK, no. It wasn't that.

292
00:17:17,487 --> 00:17:19,318
–They were gone.
–Ah.

293
00:17:19,367 --> 00:17:22,799
The cliffs were gone?
How could they just disappear?

294
00:17:23,207 --> 00:17:24,526
Erosion.

295
00:17:24,567 --> 00:17:26,807
Come off and to the cliffs with you!

296
00:17:26,847 --> 00:17:29,805
There's just another
couple of turns to go.

297
00:17:29,847 --> 00:17:32,077
Woooo!

298
00:17:43,807 --> 00:17:48,047
<i>Patrons are reminded to keep
their hands visible at all times</i>

299
00:17:48,087 --> 00:17:50,727
<i>when not availing
on the funfair rides.</i>

300
00:17:50,767 --> 00:17:54,316
Go straight home, do you hear?
No more nonsense!

301
00:17:54,367 --> 00:17:55,687
Everyone else is here.

302
00:17:55,727 --> 00:17:58,447
Dougal, you're a priest,
show some decorum.

303
00:17:58,487 --> 00:18:00,717
–Wish I wasn't a priest.
–What?

304
00:18:00,767 --> 00:18:04,203
–I wish I wasn't a priest.
–Jack heard you say that!

305
00:18:04,247 --> 00:18:06,407
He told me he doesn't believe in God.

306
00:18:06,447 --> 00:18:07,721
Dougal!

307
00:18:25,087 --> 00:18:27,927
Ted! Can I have a go on
the Crane of Death, Ted?

308
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:30,013
–The what?
–The Crane of Death.

309
00:18:30,047 --> 00:18:33,127
There was a young fellow
killed on it last year.

310
00:18:33,167 --> 00:18:35,476
Look. I'm sick and tired of your…

311
00:18:35,527 --> 00:18:38,280
Ted, a fortune teller!
We'll have one go.

312
00:18:38,327 --> 00:18:41,847
–Don't waste your money.
–There might be something in it.

313
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:44,765
It's rubbish.
How could anybody believe it?

314
00:18:44,807 --> 00:18:47,807
It's no more peculiar than
that stuff in seminary,

315
00:18:47,847 --> 00:18:50,647
heaven and hell
and everlasting life and that.

316
00:18:50,687 --> 00:18:53,047
You're not meant
to take it seriously.

317
00:18:53,087 --> 00:18:55,447
You are so too
meant to take it seriously!

318
00:18:55,487 --> 00:18:57,045
–Are you?
–Yes!

319
00:18:57,087 --> 00:19:00,189
–Heaven, hell and everlasting life?
–Of course!

320
00:19:01,407 --> 00:19:04,847
Look, Dougal, if I let you go in,
will you go home after?

321
00:19:04,887 --> 00:19:07,401
–I will, I promise, Ted.
–All right.

322
00:19:10,407 --> 00:19:13,126
–(Tarot reader) Hello.
–Let's go, Ted.

323
00:19:13,167 --> 00:19:15,158
–What's wrong?
–I'm scared.

324
00:19:15,207 --> 00:19:17,277
I'll do it and you can watch.

325
00:19:17,327 --> 00:19:19,761
–Hello there!
–Sit!

326
00:19:19,807 --> 00:19:22,567
–First, cross my palm with silver.
–Silver?

327
00:19:22,607 --> 00:19:25,973
–I don't carry bags of it around.
–Give me a pound.

328
00:19:28,807 --> 00:19:33,244
Now, I'll interpret
one card at a time, please.

329
00:19:33,287 --> 00:19:35,164
Be careful.

330
00:19:37,167 --> 00:19:38,395
(Spooky music)

331
00:19:38,447 --> 00:19:42,645
Um… I wasn't concentrating.
Perhaps I could pick another?

332
00:19:42,687 --> 00:19:45,326
No, this is
a common misunderstanding.

333
00:19:45,367 --> 00:19:48,567
The Grim Reaper doesn't mean death
in a literal sense.

334
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:51,927
Rather, it may mean
the death of an old way of life

335
00:19:51,967 --> 00:19:54,037
and the beginning of a new one!

336
00:19:54,087 --> 00:19:56,362
I know what that is.

337
00:19:56,407 --> 00:19:58,927
It's probably about
a new bicycle lamp.

338
00:19:58,967 --> 00:20:01,197
Another card, please.

339
00:20:01,247 --> 00:20:03,078
(Spooky music)

340
00:20:04,087 --> 00:20:05,964
Is that good?

341
00:20:06,007 --> 00:20:10,239
Well, ah… It will all become clear
at the next card.

342
00:20:10,287 --> 00:20:11,879
(Gong)

343
00:20:13,487 --> 00:20:17,909
This is really weird. There's only
supposed to be one in each pack.

344
00:20:22,167 --> 00:20:24,767
Hello, Tom.
Is Father Crilly around yet?

345
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:26,798
He is, yeah. He's in there.

346
00:20:26,847 --> 00:20:30,167
That's a nasty scar you've got, Tom.
Where did you get that?

347
00:20:30,207 --> 00:20:33,119
I was, uh… in an argument.

348
00:20:33,167 --> 00:20:37,399
–Oh, I hope you won.
–I certainly did.

349
00:20:37,447 --> 00:20:40,153
That's nothing.
I've had worse than that.

350
00:20:41,007 --> 00:20:43,779
Can you believe me own Dad
did that to me?

351
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:46,885
It looks like a face!

352
00:20:49,767 --> 00:20:51,327
<i>Siobhan
to the refreshment tent.</i>

353
00:20:51,367 --> 00:20:55,047
Where's Father Jack?
It's nearly five, time for his drink.

354
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:58,045
–You go that way, I'll go this way.
–OK.

355
00:20:58,087 --> 00:21:01,447
<i>Siobhan, please report
to reheat the hamburgers.</i>

356
00:21:01,487 --> 00:21:04,527
Come, now, Father,
we'd better be off. Come on.

357
00:21:04,567 --> 00:21:09,197
Father! Father!
There you are, Father.

358
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:10,965
We got here at last.

359
00:21:11,007 --> 00:21:13,840
Father, Father. Dead to the world.

360
00:21:13,887 --> 00:21:16,196
You don't know what's going on.

361
00:21:16,247 --> 00:21:18,681
Gin! Vodka!

362
00:21:18,727 --> 00:21:20,767
It's time for your drink, come on!

363
00:21:20,807 --> 00:21:23,480
Ahhh!

364
00:21:23,527 --> 00:21:26,599
Are you lads from…
from the television?

365
00:21:26,647 --> 00:21:29,605
–Well, yes.
–Oh, yes.

366
00:21:29,647 --> 00:21:34,118
–We'll just ask a few questions.
–Am I gonna be on the telly?

367
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:37,716
Well, yes. We'll start
with a history of the island,

368
00:21:37,767 --> 00:21:41,521
then move on to how life has changed
for the islanders…

369
00:21:48,887 --> 00:21:53,403
(Terry ) Father, how would you say
religious beliefs on the island

370
00:21:53,447 --> 00:21:56,847
have been affected by TV
and greater access to the media?

371
00:21:56,887 --> 00:21:59,685
God, no, they're talking to Dougal.

372
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:04,201
–Think, Ted.
–Drink! Drink!

373
00:22:04,247 --> 00:22:06,317
(Ted screams )

374
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:08,676
(Angelic choir)

375
00:22:12,567 --> 00:22:15,604
There I am! It's me, look!
I'm on the telly!

376
00:22:15,647 --> 00:22:19,799
<i>So, God, does he really exist?
I mean, who knows?</i>

377
00:22:19,847 --> 00:22:25,126
<i>I don't know. Personally, I don't
even believe in organised religion.</i>

378
00:22:25,167 --> 00:22:26,964
(Ted groans )

379
00:22:27,007 --> 00:22:29,646
I know, it's great, isn't it?

380
00:22:29,687 --> 00:22:31,120
<i>A spider baby.</i>

381
00:22:31,167 --> 00:22:35,524
<i>It's got the body of a spider
but the mind of a baby and…</i>

382
00:22:35,567 --> 00:22:37,000
(Groaning)

383
00:22:38,847 --> 00:22:42,367
<i>It wouldn't really bite you,
unless it got a bit older.</i>

384
00:22:42,407 --> 00:22:43,522
(Groaning)

385
00:22:43,567 --> 00:22:46,801
I can't believe it either,
I'm on the television!

386
00:22:48,407 --> 00:22:51,922
That gobshite again!
Is he never off the air!

387
00:22:59,967 --> 00:23:05,360
<i>A child has been, eh,
lodged in the Tunnel of Goats.</i>

388
00:23:05,407 --> 00:23:10,357
<i>If we could have a nurse, please,
to the Tunnel of Goats, thank you.</i>

389
00:23:12,727 --> 00:23:18,006
<i>A goat and a child
have now become lodged together, eh,</i>

390
00:23:18,047 --> 00:23:22,245
<i>and a nurse has become involved
in the… in the incident.</i>

391
00:23:22,287 --> 00:23:28,601
<i>Another nurse is required to release
the nurse we asked for previously.</i>

392
00:23:28,647 --> 00:23:30,046
<i>Thank you.</i>

392
00:23:31,305 --> 00:24:31,260
